1
00:00:40.707 --> 00:00:42.458
(Chattering indistinctly)

2
00:01:08.943 --> 00:01:10.570
(People chattering indistinctly)

3
00:01:13.031 --> 00:01:15.450
What's the charge, sister?
Half a dollar a dance.


4
00:01:15.742 --> 00:01:17.660
You mean them women
are countesses? Some are.


5
00:01:17.952 --> 00:01:20.038
No kiddin'.
Give me five bucks' worth.


6
00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:24.459
Thank you, sir.

7
00:01:28.713 --> 00:01:31.674
Well, I got a ticket to dance
with a countess. Go to it, buddy.


8
00:01:31.966 --> 00:01:34.802
Want to tell the folks back
home I'm movin' in high society.


9
00:01:37.305 --> 00:01:39.474
Oh, pardon me. Can
I sit down? Please.


10
00:01:39.766 --> 00:01:41.225
I've got a ticket to dance.

11
00:01:42.935 --> 00:01:43.935
You a countess?

12
00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:47.982
No kiddin'.

13
00:01:48.274 --> 00:01:50.985
Tell me, how many countesses
are there around here?


14
00:01:51.277 --> 00:01:52.820
Oh, quite a few.

15
00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:03.247
(Orchestral music playing)

16
00:02:05.208 --> 00:02:06.626
(Inaudible)

17
00:03:09.021 --> 00:03:10.690
(Ship horn blowing)

18
00:03:24.746 --> 00:03:28.124
Every statesman, every minister
and diplomat should dedicate himself


19
00:03:28.416 --> 00:03:31.335
to the cause of world peace.
(Knocking rhythmically on door)


20
00:03:31.627 --> 00:03:35.131
Ogden, it's Harvey! Oh, ogden,
are you still at that speech?


21
00:03:35.423 --> 00:03:38.593
Now, here we are, China, Hong Kong,
and you're still trying to save the world.


22
00:03:38.885 --> 00:03:41.888
Let's get out of here. See the
town. We're only staying 24 hours.


23
00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.991
All right, Crawford. We'll
finish this after lunch.


24
00:03:44.015 --> 00:03:47.185
Okay, sir.

25
00:03:47.477 --> 00:03:51.689
Can ya believe it? Hong Kong. By
golly, I can see a chinaman out there.


26
00:03:51.981 --> 00:03:53.775
I wouldn't be at all surprised.

27
00:03:54.066 --> 00:03:57.653
Look at them. Packed
together like sardines.


28
00:03:57.945 --> 00:04:00.531
That's what I dislike about
the poor. They have no taste.


29
00:04:00.823 --> 00:04:04.076
They indulge in squalor. They pick
the worst neighborhoods to live in,


30
00:04:04.368 --> 00:04:08.039
eat the worst kind of food
and dress atrociously.


31
00:04:08.331 --> 00:04:11.417
That's the first time I've seen you
smile since we've been on this trip.


32
00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:14.003
That wasn't a smile.
That was a gas pain.


33
00:04:14.295 --> 00:04:16.923
(Ship horn blowing)
How do you feel, buddy?


34
00:04:17.215 --> 00:04:18.633
Depressed.

35
00:04:18.925 --> 00:04:20.235
You should be the
happiest man in the world.


36
00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:22.220
In six weeks you'll be divorced

37
00:04:22.512 --> 00:04:24.889
and possibly the next
secretary of state.


38
00:04:25.181 --> 00:04:27.642
We'll wait and see.
Here's the day's paper.


39
00:04:27.934 --> 00:04:29.894
"Ogden mears, multi-millionaire,

40
00:04:30.186 --> 00:04:31.896
"son of the richest oilman
in the world


41
00:04:32.188 --> 00:04:34.106
"will be the new
secretary of state."


42
00:04:35.608 --> 00:04:36.734
Let me see that.

43
00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:39.487
You didn't finish the sentence.

44
00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:42.907
"According to the latest rumor."

45
00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:46.244
"Son of the richest oilman in the
world." They won't let you forget it.


46
00:04:46.536 --> 00:04:48.204
That's the burden
you must carry.


47
00:04:50.331 --> 00:04:53.626
(Laughs) Harvey,
you're a corrupting influence.


48
00:04:53.918 --> 00:04:56.838
Maybe, but I didn't
lead you into politics.


49
00:04:57.129 --> 00:04:59.423
What else is there to do?
Murder, arson, rape.


50
00:04:59.715 --> 00:05:02.301
There's plenty of other worthy
occupations. (Doorbell buzzing)


51
00:05:02.593 --> 00:05:04.595
Crawford, sir.
Come in, Crawford.


52
00:05:05.847 --> 00:05:07.265
Just came over the wire.

53
00:05:07.557 --> 00:05:09.397
The president has appointed
Mr. Patrick dowling


54
00:05:09.684 --> 00:05:12.186
secretary of state.
Dowling, huh?


55
00:05:12.478 --> 00:05:14.605
Well, that's show business.

56
00:05:14.897 --> 00:05:18.276
Who the devil is Patrick dowling?
Ogden: Secretary of state.


57
00:05:18.568 --> 00:05:20.152
I'll check for more news.

58
00:05:20.444 --> 00:05:21.696
Thank you, Crawford.

59
00:05:21.988 --> 00:05:23.447
Well, Harvey,
I guess you're right.


60
00:05:23.739 --> 00:05:25.950
I think I'll give up
trying to save the world.


61
00:05:26.242 --> 00:05:29.287
Tonight we're gonna celebrate
Patrick dowling's appointment.


62
00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:34.876
Excuse me, sir.
Mr. Clark has telephoned.


63
00:05:35.167 --> 00:05:36.586
Mr. Clark? Where is he?

64
00:05:36.878 --> 00:05:38.918
Up in the lounge, sir.
He says he's on his way down.


65
00:05:38.963 --> 00:05:40.798
Well, show him here. Yes, sir.

66
00:05:43.342 --> 00:05:46.596
Who's Clark? He's one
of father's senior directors.


67
00:05:46.888 --> 00:05:48.389
A venerable old gentleman.

68
00:05:48.681 --> 00:05:50.284
Listen, we don't want to
get stuck with that old boy


69
00:05:50.308 --> 00:05:51.368
for the rest of the evening.

70
00:05:51.392 --> 00:05:52.685
No, no, I'll get rid of him.

71
00:05:52.977 --> 00:05:54.337
Remember you just
got over the flu.


72
00:05:54.604 --> 00:05:56.248
Took a long sea voyage
to get away from it all.


73
00:05:56.272 --> 00:05:58.482
We don't want to be
visiting parks and museums.


74
00:05:58.774 --> 00:06:01.527
Mr. Clark, sir.

75
00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:05.781
Ogden, my dear boy, I haven't seen
you since you were in swaddling clothes.


76
00:06:06.073 --> 00:06:08.910
I must say you're the replica
of your father. (Chuckles)


77
00:06:09.201 --> 00:06:13.414
Uh, Mr. Clark, may I present my
friend Harvey crothers, Mr. Clark?


78
00:06:13.706 --> 00:06:15.374
How do you do?
I beg your pardon.


79
00:06:15.666 --> 00:06:16.834
Well, sir.

80
00:06:17.126 --> 00:06:18.604
Hudson tells me
you're under the weather


81
00:06:18.628 --> 00:06:20.228
and here I am ready
to show you the town.


82
00:06:20.254 --> 00:06:23.299
Unfortunately, this is my
first day up after the flu.


83
00:06:23.591 --> 00:06:26.677
And I think perhaps I'd better
stay inside and just take things easy.


84
00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:29.388
Of course, my dear boy.
I'll not disturb you.


85
00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:33.351
But before I go, I'd like to introduce
some very dear friends of mine.


86
00:06:33.643 --> 00:06:35.937
They're waiting in the
lounge. (Mouthing)


87
00:06:36.228 --> 00:06:40.399
Well, certainly. Hudson, would
you show Mr. Clark's friends in?


88
00:06:40.691 --> 00:06:43.027
Clark: They're alone in the
lounge. You can't miss them.


89
00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:44.612
Hudson: Yes, sir.

90
00:06:44.904 --> 00:06:47.406
Well, ogden. Too bad
you're not up to scratch.


91
00:06:47.698 --> 00:06:49.784
I was looking foward to
showing you around Hong Kong.


92
00:06:50.076 --> 00:06:53.156
Yes, well, I'm disappointed. I was
reading about it and it sounds fascinating.


93
00:06:53.371 --> 00:06:55.164
The botanical gardens
and the museums...


94
00:06:55.456 --> 00:06:57.917
Oh, dear, dear me,
dear me. (Laughs)


95
00:06:58.209 --> 00:07:01.545
Botanical gardens? (Laughs) I
think we can do better than that.


96
00:07:04.298 --> 00:07:06.050
(Orchestral music
playing on radio)


97
00:07:15.476 --> 00:07:17.687
I guess I've been reading
the wrong book.


98
00:07:17.979 --> 00:07:20.606
Ogden, these are my friends.

99
00:07:20.898 --> 00:07:22.733
This is Mr. Ogden mears.

100
00:07:23.734 --> 00:07:25.403
Mr. Harvey crothers.

101
00:07:27.029 --> 00:07:29.365
Countess chiedoff.

102
00:07:29.657 --> 00:07:31.742
Countess natascha alexandrov.

103
00:07:33.411 --> 00:07:35.579
Baroness cavanotchy.

104
00:07:35.871 --> 00:07:38.040
Hello, I'd like a drink.

105
00:07:38.332 --> 00:07:40.334
No, no, baroness.
It's too early.


106
00:07:40.626 --> 00:07:42.420
Excuse me. Uh...
What will you have, ladies?


107
00:07:42.712 --> 00:07:44.463
Champagne. Champagne, champagne.

108
00:07:48.509 --> 00:07:49.677
(Turns radio off)

109
00:07:51.554 --> 00:07:53.097
No, no, don't turn it off.

110
00:07:53.389 --> 00:07:55.975
Music complements the champagne.

111
00:07:56.267 --> 00:07:58.561
(Orchestral music resumes)
Ladies, would you be seated?


112
00:08:12.033 --> 00:08:14.493
Too bad you're just
getting over the flu, ogden.


113
00:08:14.785 --> 00:08:18.205
I thought we might go on somewhere
this evening and take the ladies along.


114
00:08:18.497 --> 00:08:20.583
But then the night air
might be dangerous for you.


115
00:08:20.875 --> 00:08:23.753
Oh, I think if I wrap
up well it'll be all right.


116
00:08:27.048 --> 00:08:28.799
(Chattering indistinctly)

117
00:08:39.143 --> 00:08:41.228
Where are the girls?

118
00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.790
I don't know. I think they went to
the ladies' room as soon as you left.


119
00:08:43.814 --> 00:08:46.358
I must have inspired them
with the same idea.


120
00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:49.361
Let me tell you about
these ladies. Harvey.


121
00:08:50.988 --> 00:08:53.574
They are the daughters
of Russian aristocrats.


122
00:08:53.866 --> 00:08:56.285
Their titles
are absolutely genuine.


123
00:08:56.577 --> 00:09:00.039
Their parents escaped to Shanghai
during the Russian revolution.


124
00:09:00.331 --> 00:09:03.584
Shanghai was a nasty place
in those days.


125
00:09:03.876 --> 00:09:07.963
An international settlement
run by seven nations.


126
00:09:08.255 --> 00:09:11.967
Because they had no country,
their life was worthless.


127
00:09:12.259 --> 00:09:16.222
They could be robbed,
murdered. Nobody bothered.


128
00:09:16.514 --> 00:09:18.933
Countess natascha,
the one sitting next to you


129
00:09:19.225 --> 00:09:21.268
has had rather a sad life.

130
00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:24.772
She was the mistress of a
gangster at the age of 14.


131
00:09:25.064 --> 00:09:27.650
Ogden: How did the others
manage to live?


132
00:09:27.942 --> 00:09:31.445
Many starved,
others committed suicide.


133
00:09:31.737 --> 00:09:34.073
Some of the women
worked in dance halls.


134
00:09:34.365 --> 00:09:36.826
The men had to compete
with the cheapest labor


135
00:09:37.118 --> 00:09:38.678
because they couldn't
leave the country.


136
00:09:44.125 --> 00:09:46.210
I think Harvey
is very good-looking.


137
00:09:46.502 --> 00:09:48.629
A lot of good that'll do you.
He's penniless.


138
00:09:48.921 --> 00:09:51.882
So what? Haven't you
any romance in your soul?


139
00:09:52.174 --> 00:09:54.301
Money makes me romantic.

140
00:09:54.593 --> 00:09:56.804
I thought Harvey
was the one with the dough.


141
00:09:57.096 --> 00:09:58.848
You have poor instincts,
my dear.


142
00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:01.559
It's the other one, ogden
mears, who has the money.


143
00:10:01.851 --> 00:10:06.605
He's the son of the richest oilman in
the world and natascha's got him hooked.


144
00:10:06.897 --> 00:10:09.608
Mr. Ogden? He's very attractive.

145
00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:12.153
(Scoffs) Leave it to natascha.

146
00:10:12.444 --> 00:10:14.655
She's like a divining stick
finding water.


147
00:10:14.947 --> 00:10:17.992
Only in her case,
she's found oil.


148
00:10:18.284 --> 00:10:20.244
Well, you can have
your big oilman.


149
00:10:20.536 --> 00:10:22.580
He's here today
and gone tomorrow.


150
00:10:22.872 --> 00:10:25.040
But I shall stick
to old papa Clark.


151
00:10:25.332 --> 00:10:27.251
He took me away
from the dance halls.


152
00:10:29.336 --> 00:10:31.088
(Orchestra playing)

153
00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:47.229
Listen, Milton...
Pardon me, Mr. Milton Clark.


154
00:10:47.521 --> 00:10:49.607
Would you like to dance?
(Chuckling)


155
00:10:49.899 --> 00:10:50.983
Natascha.

156
00:11:06.999 --> 00:11:08.834
You're very quiet this evening.

157
00:11:09.126 --> 00:11:12.087
Am I? I'm sorry.

158
00:11:12.379 --> 00:11:14.673
Don't apologize.
I like quiet people.


159
00:11:14.965 --> 00:11:17.968
They're either clever orduw

160
00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.471
I would say you're
one of the clever ones.


161
00:11:20.763 --> 00:11:24.391
Thank you.
I'd better keep silent.


162
00:11:24.683 --> 00:11:27.978
Well, whatever you do,
it's very attractive.


163
00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:33.359
Would you like to dance? No, I'd
like to sit here and talk with you.


164
00:11:33.651 --> 00:11:36.612
I regret I speak English so
badly. You speak it beautifully.


165
00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:41.408
I understand
you were born in Shanghai.


166
00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:43.452
Yes. But my parents
came from Russia.


167
00:11:45.246 --> 00:11:46.664
And now they've moved
to Hong Kong?


168
00:11:46.956 --> 00:11:50.209
My parents died in Shanghai
when I was 13.


169
00:11:50.501 --> 00:11:55.047
Haven't you any brothers or
sisters? I was an only child.


170
00:11:55.339 --> 00:11:58.801
Thirteen, a little young
to face the world.


171
00:11:59.093 --> 00:12:00.886
We must all face it
sooner or later.


172
00:12:01.887 --> 00:12:03.180
Some more sooner.

173
00:12:05.015 --> 00:12:06.934
How did you come
to live in Hong Kong?


174
00:12:07.226 --> 00:12:12.106
Well, there was another war,
another revolution. So here we are.


175
00:12:12.398 --> 00:12:14.525
But let us talk of
something more cheerful.


176
00:12:15.901 --> 00:12:17.236
I'm sorry.

177
00:12:17.528 --> 00:12:19.697
Would you like to dance?
I'd love to.


178
00:12:28.122 --> 00:12:29.540
(Music continues)

179
00:12:40.968 --> 00:12:42.636
(Knocking on door)

180
00:12:42.928 --> 00:12:44.430
Congratulations,
your excellency.


181
00:12:44.722 --> 00:12:47.266
You are now a plenipotentiary
extraordinary.


182
00:12:47.558 --> 00:12:49.101
Harvey, will you ring
for the steward


183
00:12:49.393 --> 00:12:51.061
and have him bring
some ice water?


184
00:12:51.353 --> 00:12:52.353
Oh.

185
00:12:56.442 --> 00:12:58.569
What's this pleni-pli-plen-what?

186
00:12:58.861 --> 00:13:00.981
Oh, it just came over the
radio. You've been appointed


187
00:13:01.071 --> 00:13:04.408
plenipotentiary extraordinary
to the court of Saudi Arabia.


188
00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:06.618
I'll never get away
from the oil business.


189
00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:08.579
You been sleeping
on that couch all night?


190
00:13:08.871 --> 00:13:10.706
What's this? Telephone numbers.

191
00:13:10.998 --> 00:13:13.125
Some of your first official
appointments, I guess.


192
00:13:13.417 --> 00:13:15.544
And this?

193
00:13:15.836 --> 00:13:17.981
Some roughneck guy got fresh with natascha
in the nightclub and you clipped him.


194
00:13:18.005 --> 00:13:21.967
I clipped him?
A brawl in a nightclub?


195
00:13:22.259 --> 00:13:24.553
Well, I'm off to a fine start
as ambassador.


196
00:13:24.845 --> 00:13:26.597
Steward, sir.

197
00:13:26.889 --> 00:13:29.576
Steward, would you bring me some
alka-seltzer and some ice water, please?


198
00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:30.684
Yes, sir.

199
00:13:32.895 --> 00:13:34.063
Who's natascha?

200
00:13:34.355 --> 00:13:36.023
You don't know natascha?
You ought to.


201
00:13:36.315 --> 00:13:37.995
You were pretty clubby
with her last night.


202
00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:40.110
What do you mean "clubby"?
From the verb "club."


203
00:13:40.402 --> 00:13:42.654
To form an association
united by a common interest.


204
00:13:42.946 --> 00:13:45.657
That's enough. I don't want to
hear any more. Where are we?


205
00:13:45.949 --> 00:13:48.452
Way out at sea.
When did we leave Hong Kong?


206
00:13:48.744 --> 00:13:51.038
Two hours ago. (Bell ringing)

207
00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:53.090
That's the first call
for lunch. Coming down?


208
00:13:53.207 --> 00:13:56.752
No, I'm gonna take a bath
and get myself together.


209
00:13:57.044 --> 00:13:58.837
I'll call ya later then. Yeah.

210
00:14:19.817 --> 00:14:22.611
Uh, Hudson.

211
00:14:24.196 --> 00:14:26.115
Just fixing your bath, sir.

212
00:14:52.516 --> 00:14:54.226
What are you doing, Hudson?

213
00:14:54.518 --> 00:14:56.238
Just making a note
of the telephone numbers.


214
00:14:56.311 --> 00:14:57.938
Oh, don't bother with them.

215
00:15:15.038 --> 00:15:16.748
Oh! I beg your pardon.

216
00:15:21.336 --> 00:15:22.671
Did I startle you?

217
00:15:23.547 --> 00:15:24.547
Who are you?

218
00:15:24.756 --> 00:15:26.258
I'm natascha.

219
00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:28.051
Oh, well, how do you do?

220
00:15:28.343 --> 00:15:29.928
Are we alone?

221
00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:32.115
I don't know. Maybe there's
somebody under the bed.


222
00:15:32.139 --> 00:15:34.516
(Chuckles) I'm sorry.

223
00:15:34.808 --> 00:15:36.977
Yes, well, what are you doing
in that closet?


224
00:15:37.269 --> 00:15:39.429
Well, sir, if you'll allow
me, I'll explain everything.


225
00:15:39.563 --> 00:15:41.440
Go ahead.

226
00:15:41.732 --> 00:15:43.877
I don't know whether you remember
the baroness, the countess and me?


227
00:15:43.901 --> 00:15:45.402
Yes. Well, get to the point.

228
00:15:45.694 --> 00:15:48.030
After leaving the pantheon,
we finally finished up here.


229
00:15:48.322 --> 00:15:49.490
And then?

230
00:15:49.781 --> 00:15:51.217
Then you fell asleep,
so everyone left,


231
00:15:51.241 --> 00:15:52.761
but I came back
to look for my handbag.


232
00:15:52.993 --> 00:15:55.078
Enough of that. Why are you
hiding in that closet?


233
00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:57.080
Well, let's face it.
I've stowed away.


234
00:15:57.372 --> 00:16:00.000
You what? I'm going to america.

235
00:16:01.001 --> 00:16:02.127
Are you crazy?

236
00:16:02.419 --> 00:16:04.004
Please don't get excited.

237
00:16:04.296 --> 00:16:06.649
If you let me stay until the
purser's checked all the passengers,


238
00:16:06.673 --> 00:16:08.842
I'll leave your cabin and
will never bother you again.


239
00:16:09.134 --> 00:16:11.694
And if anyone comes, I can hide
in the bathroom or in the closet.


240
00:16:11.929 --> 00:16:12.930
(Doorbell buzzing)

241
00:16:19.311 --> 00:16:21.647
Who is it?

242
00:16:21.939 --> 00:16:25.259
Hudson, sir, with the menu. In case you
should want lunch before the kitchens close.


243
00:16:25.442 --> 00:16:27.194
Thank you. Call later, Hudson.

244
00:16:37.663 --> 00:16:39.331
You see how simple it is.

245
00:16:39.623 --> 00:16:41.166
After the purser's
checked everyone,


246
00:16:41.458 --> 00:16:44.836
no one will know whether
I'm a passenger or not.


247
00:16:45.128 --> 00:16:46.838
Now look, the best thing
for you to do


248
00:16:47.130 --> 00:16:49.370
is go straight to the captain
and tell him what happened.


249
00:16:49.466 --> 00:16:51.843
You were visiting friends
and you were left aboard.


250
00:16:52.135 --> 00:16:54.846
But isn't it awkward if he wants
to know where I slept all night?


251
00:16:55.138 --> 00:16:58.517
Of course not! 
What do you mean?

252
00:16:58.809 --> 00:17:01.603
Tell him the truth. There's nothing
to hide. (Doorbell buzzing)


253
00:17:08.402 --> 00:17:10.571
Who is it?
Steward: Alka-seltzer, sir.


254
00:17:16.326 --> 00:17:17.369
Thank you, sir.

255
00:17:24.876 --> 00:17:26.962
Look, I must take my bath
and get dressed now.


256
00:17:27.254 --> 00:17:28.422
Yes, of course.

257
00:17:31.717 --> 00:17:33.385
Do you mind leaving?

258
00:17:33.677 --> 00:17:36.722
Oh, I'm so sorry. I can
wait in the next room.


259
00:17:37.014 --> 00:17:38.734
Just a minute. You
don't seem to understand.


260
00:17:38.932 --> 00:17:40.118
You cannot wait in this suite.

261
00:17:40.142 --> 00:17:41.476
I have friends coming.

262
00:17:41.768 --> 00:17:43.687
But where can I go?
That's your problem.


263
00:17:43.979 --> 00:17:46.139
Please let me stay until the
purser's checked everyone.


264
00:17:46.189 --> 00:17:48.775
No, no. I promise. After tonight,
you'll never see me again.


265
00:17:49.067 --> 00:17:50.947
You'll have to leave these
premises immediately.


266
00:17:51.069 --> 00:17:53.309
I can't leave dressed like
this in the middle of the day.


267
00:17:53.530 --> 00:17:56.825
However, you can't
stay here. I must!


268
00:17:57.117 --> 00:17:59.357
Well, if you insist, I shall
have to ring for the purser.


269
00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:01.246
If you do, I'll scream,

270
00:18:01.538 --> 00:18:03.658
I'll tear my clothes and
swear you tried to attack me.


271
00:18:08.754 --> 00:18:10.964
This is blackmail.
Yes, blackmail.


272
00:18:11.256 --> 00:18:12.841
Oh, no, no, I didn't mean it.

273
00:18:13.133 --> 00:18:14.373
That was a stupid thing to say.

274
00:18:14.635 --> 00:18:16.094
Certainly was.

275
00:18:16.386 --> 00:18:17.697
Of course it isn't blackmail.
I don't want your money.


276
00:18:17.721 --> 00:18:19.041
I want to get away
from Hong Kong.


277
00:18:19.306 --> 00:18:21.075
I tried to tell you that
last night but you...


278
00:18:21.099 --> 00:18:23.769
You've told me enough. (Burping)
You wouldn't let me explain.


279
00:18:24.061 --> 00:18:25.413
I'm gonna give you
one more chance.


280
00:18:25.437 --> 00:18:26.772
Are you going
to leave this cabin?


281
00:18:27.064 --> 00:18:28.899
No. And if you ring
the bell, I'll scream.


282
00:18:29.191 --> 00:18:31.169
We'll see about that. Please,
please, I never meant it.


283
00:18:31.193 --> 00:18:32.819
Stand away from
that bell. No, I won't.


284
00:18:33.111 --> 00:18:35.530
Then I'll ring from the
next room. (Burps) Oh!


285
00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:38.700
Please, please, I beg you!

286
00:18:40.661 --> 00:18:42.079
Now go ahead and scream.

287
00:19:09.731 --> 00:19:11.066
Where is that steward?

288
00:19:20.409 --> 00:19:22.209
Steward, would you please
send for the purser?


289
00:19:22.369 --> 00:19:23.620
Yes, sir. Thank you.

290
00:19:28.208 --> 00:19:30.085
Don't bother. I'll go.

291
00:19:30.377 --> 00:19:32.170
Well, I'm sorry, but if I
succumb to sympathy


292
00:19:32.462 --> 00:19:33.922
I'd have the whole world
on my neck.


293
00:19:35.632 --> 00:19:37.926
Now, if it's just a question
of paying your fare


294
00:19:38.218 --> 00:19:40.971
to wherever you
want to go, I'll do that.


295
00:19:41.263 --> 00:19:44.349
But you have to get off
at the next stop.


296
00:19:44.641 --> 00:19:46.977
It's no use. That's
Japan. They'll arrest me.


297
00:19:47.269 --> 00:19:48.269
Why?

298
00:19:48.437 --> 00:19:49.646
I haven't a passport.

299
00:19:49.938 --> 00:19:51.523
You haven't a passport?

300
00:19:51.815 --> 00:19:53.895
Well, how do you expect
to land in the United States?


301
00:19:53.942 --> 00:19:55.402
I'll get in some way.

302
00:19:55.694 --> 00:19:58.488
My dear young lady,
you haven't a chance.


303
00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:01.616
Now the best thing for you
to do is return to Hong Kong.


304
00:20:02.743 --> 00:20:04.286
Never.

305
00:20:04.578 --> 00:20:06.872
I'll talk to the purser and
see if we can get you a cabin.


306
00:20:07.164 --> 00:20:08.665
(Doorbell buzzing) Who is it?

307
00:20:08.957 --> 00:20:10.876
The purser, your excellency. Oh.

308
00:20:12.544 --> 00:20:15.213
Here, in... oh, yeah.

309
00:20:19.134 --> 00:20:22.053
Good afternoon, your excellency.

310
00:20:22.345 --> 00:20:26.725
Good afternoon, purser. I'd like to
know if you have an extra berth or a cabin.


311
00:20:27.017 --> 00:20:29.811
Oh, I'm sorry, sir. We haven't a
thing. We're completely full up.


312
00:20:30.103 --> 00:20:32.230
There might be something
at Kobe, but I doubt it.


313
00:20:32.522 --> 00:20:33.857
When do we get to Kobe?

314
00:20:34.149 --> 00:20:36.735
Tomorrow morning at

315
00:20:37.027 --> 00:20:39.488
Is there anything else I
can do for your excellency?


316
00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:41.698
No, not a thing. Thank you.

317
00:21:05.931 --> 00:21:07.182
Well, they're full up.

318
00:21:07.474 --> 00:21:09.810
Fuhup? Yeah.

319
00:21:10.101 --> 00:21:12.062
Oh, well, we'll manage somehow.

320
00:21:12.354 --> 00:21:16.691
Will we? Where do you think
you're gonna sleep tonight?


321
00:21:16.983 --> 00:21:20.111
As soon as it's dark, I can
sleep in one of the lifeboats.


322
00:21:20.403 --> 00:21:22.781
Whatever made you think
you could get away with this?


323
00:21:23.073 --> 00:21:27.619
I didn't think. It was an
impulse. A chance to escape.


324
00:21:27.911 --> 00:21:28.911
Escape? Escape from what?

325
00:21:29.037 --> 00:21:30.497
Have you committed a crime?

326
00:21:30.789 --> 00:21:34.084
Of course not. Escape from
despair, hopelessness, no future.


327
00:21:34.376 --> 00:21:37.504
Nothing to look foward to but
dance halls and prostitution.


328
00:21:37.796 --> 00:21:40.465
But I am determined
not to slowly die and rot.


329
00:21:40.757 --> 00:21:42.467
Well, that's no excuse
for your actions.


330
00:21:42.759 --> 00:21:46.137
There's no excuse for
many things in this world.


331
00:21:46.429 --> 00:21:48.515
Oh, well, you're getting
off at Kobe, the next stop.


332
00:21:48.807 --> 00:21:52.143
Then I can stay?
Stay? I can't get rid of you.


333
00:21:52.435 --> 00:21:55.397
Now do you mind going in the
other room while I take a bath?


334
00:21:55.689 --> 00:21:57.315
Not at all, your excellency.

335
00:21:57.607 --> 00:22:00.151
And if anyone knocks, don't
answer. No, your excellency.


336
00:22:00.443 --> 00:22:02.612
And lay off the
"excellency." Yes, sir.


337
00:22:14.749 --> 00:22:16.877
What are you going
to do about food?


338
00:22:17.168 --> 00:22:19.671
It's no hardship to miss
a meal occasionally.


339
00:22:19.963 --> 00:22:23.049
You want me to break
down and weep? No, but...


340
00:22:23.341 --> 00:22:26.303
Well, then, Mark down what you
want on the menu while I lock the door.


341
00:22:40.358 --> 00:22:43.320
Now, when you hear a knock
like this, you'll know it's me.


342
00:22:43.612 --> 00:22:45.488
(Knocking seven times in rhythm)

343
00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:48.033
(Knocking repeated outside)

344
00:22:51.494 --> 00:22:52.662
Crawford: It's Crawford.

345
00:22:55.457 --> 00:22:56.875
Come in, Crawford.

346
00:22:57.167 --> 00:22:59.044
Harvey says not to wait
for him for lunch.


347
00:22:59.336 --> 00:23:01.838
He's not feeling too well. I
think he's got an upset stomach.


348
00:23:02.130 --> 00:23:03.840
I've got a little
upset stomach myself.


349
00:23:04.132 --> 00:23:06.413
Excuse me, sir. The kitchens
will be closed in 10 minutes.


350
00:23:07.218 --> 00:23:09.179
Oh, well, here it is.

351
00:23:11.723 --> 00:23:14.643
"Chicken a la king, potato
au gratin, string beans,


352
00:23:14.935 --> 00:23:18.563
"cauliflower, a glass of
milk and caramel ice cream


353
00:23:18.855 --> 00:23:20.941
"with hot chocolate sauce," sir?

354
00:23:21.232 --> 00:23:22.317
That's about it.

355
00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:26.071
That's not bad
for an upset stomach.


356
00:23:55.141 --> 00:23:57.352
(Knocking five times
in rhythm) Ogden.


357
00:24:14.536 --> 00:24:15.787
(Clears throat)

358
00:24:18.581 --> 00:24:21.126
(Fingers tapping)

359
00:24:25.922 --> 00:24:27.882
(Tapping continues)

360
00:24:33.888 --> 00:24:35.932
(Tapping continues)

361
00:24:47.986 --> 00:24:49.612
(Tapping continues)

362
00:25:04.127 --> 00:25:05.628
(Tapping stops)

363
00:25:07.172 --> 00:25:08.173
(Book thuds)

364
00:25:08.465 --> 00:25:11.468
Oh, excuse me.

365
00:25:15.972 --> 00:25:17.057
(Yawns)

366
00:25:19.142 --> 00:25:20.643
Why don't you go to bed?

367
00:25:20.935 --> 00:25:22.604
Well, I thought
I'd wait for you.


368
00:25:22.896 --> 00:25:26.357
Oh, that is, I... I don't
know where to go.


369
00:25:26.649 --> 00:25:29.527
You'd better run along
to your lifeboat.


370
00:25:29.819 --> 00:25:31.654
(Chuckling)
It's no laughing matter.


371
00:25:33.198 --> 00:25:35.575
However, you can sleep
in the next room.


372
00:25:35.867 --> 00:25:39.079
Where are you going to
sleep? That's my business.


373
00:25:40.914 --> 00:25:42.457
There's another bed
in the other room,


374
00:25:42.749 --> 00:25:44.125
if you'd care to sleep there.

375
00:25:44.417 --> 00:25:46.503
Thank you.
I'm sleeping on the sofa.


376
00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:55.595
(Orchestral music
playing on radio)


377
00:26:14.489 --> 00:26:16.407
I suppose you have
nothing to sleep in.


378
00:26:16.699 --> 00:26:17.867
Oh, don't bother.

379
00:26:28.128 --> 00:26:31.589
Here, you can use
these and this. Thank you.


380
00:26:31.881 --> 00:26:35.426
I'm sorry I don't have
any hairpins or toothbrush.


381
00:26:35.718 --> 00:26:39.681
I feel terrible putting you
to all this trouble.


382
00:26:39.973 --> 00:26:44.102
Hmm. You can write me to that
effect when you're off this boat.


383
00:27:23.141 --> 00:27:24.141
Come in.

384
00:27:43.119 --> 00:27:44.454
Ogden, you mustn't.

385
00:27:48.583 --> 00:27:50.210
(Radio volume increases)

386
00:27:59.719 --> 00:28:01.638
(Radio volume decreases)

387
00:28:05.141 --> 00:28:08.603
Please don't turn the radio
down. Keep it up. Keep it up.


388
00:28:10.605 --> 00:28:11.606
Sorry.

389
00:28:14.275 --> 00:28:16.319
(Radio volume increases)

390
00:28:39.801 --> 00:28:40.927
Get up out of there.

391
00:28:41.219 --> 00:28:42.637
Oh, I wish
you'd let me sleep here.


392
00:28:42.929 --> 00:28:44.289
I feel I'm robbing you
of your bed.


393
00:28:44.514 --> 00:28:46.140
You're robbing me of my sleep.

394
00:28:46.432 --> 00:28:49.686
Look. I'm very comfortable here.

395
00:28:49.978 --> 00:28:52.730
(Doorbell buzzes) Ooh! Ah!

396
00:28:55.984 --> 00:28:57.384
Crawford: Mr. Ogden,
are you asleep?


397
00:28:57.568 --> 00:28:59.404
Yes. What is it?

398
00:28:59.696 --> 00:29:01.715
It's Crawford. Harvey's been in
bed all day with an upset stomach.


399
00:29:01.739 --> 00:29:03.783
Can you give him something?
Just a minute.


400
00:29:12.458 --> 00:29:14.520
Tell him to take this. He'll
feel 100% in the morning.


401
00:29:14.544 --> 00:29:15.878
Thanks.

402
00:29:16.170 --> 00:29:17.690
Good night, Crawford.
Good night, boss.


403
00:29:34.022 --> 00:29:36.816
Now, you get in the
other room and stay there.


404
00:29:37.108 --> 00:29:39.402
Be careful. These
pajamas are transparent.


405
00:29:39.694 --> 00:29:40.987
So are you.

406
00:29:41.279 --> 00:29:43.072
(Sighs) Good night.

407
00:30:06.804 --> 00:30:07.805
Come in.

408
00:30:12.769 --> 00:30:14.187
I believe this is yours.

409
00:30:17.774 --> 00:30:19.484
Good night. Good night.

410
00:30:57.980 --> 00:31:00.525
Up, come on, get up. We're
gonna be in Kobe in 15 minutes.


411
00:31:00.817 --> 00:31:03.297
(Orchestral music plays
on radio) Yes, sir, I'll tidy up first.


412
00:31:11.244 --> 00:31:13.329
(Radio volume decreases)
(Water running)


413
00:31:13.621 --> 00:31:16.165
(Radio volume increases)

414
00:31:34.559 --> 00:31:36.036
Now, what are you going
to have for breakfast?


415
00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:37.060
Oh, anything, sir.

416
00:31:37.311 --> 00:31:38.511
Two boiled eggs, four minutes,

417
00:31:38.646 --> 00:31:40.690
a little bacon,
toast and coffee.


418
00:31:40.982 --> 00:31:43.109
Eggs, bacon, toast and coffee.

419
00:31:43.401 --> 00:31:46.529
Oh, and hot milk to go
with the coffee. Hot milk.


420
00:31:46.821 --> 00:31:49.740
Oh, yes, and marmalade.
And marmalade.


421
00:31:50.032 --> 00:31:52.243
Boiled eggs.
I suppose they're fresh?


422
00:31:52.535 --> 00:31:53.828
I don't know about the eggs.

423
00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:00.668
(Doorbell buzzes)

424
00:32:03.963 --> 00:32:05.339
(Door slams)

425
00:32:05.631 --> 00:32:07.467
Who is it? Steward, sir.

426
00:32:09.802 --> 00:32:12.013
Good morning,
sir. Breakfast? Yes.


427
00:32:14.974 --> 00:32:17.435
"Two eggs, bacon, toast and
coffee, hot milk, marmalade."


428
00:32:17.727 --> 00:32:19.020
(Pipes squeaking) That all, sir?

429
00:32:19.312 --> 00:32:20.873
Yes, and would you serve it
in the next room, please?


430
00:32:20.897 --> 00:32:22.064
Very good, sir.

431
00:32:26.944 --> 00:32:28.446
What were you doing?

432
00:32:28.738 --> 00:32:30.716
The bath was overflowing.
So I turned the taps off.


433
00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:31.908
(Doorbell buzzes) (Gasps)

434
00:32:38.998 --> 00:32:41.518
Good morning, boss. I just came
down to tell you a batch of reporters


435
00:32:41.542 --> 00:32:43.896
got on with the pilot and they're
waiting now to interview you.


436
00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:45.640
Morning, ogden. I just
came down to tell you


437
00:32:45.671 --> 00:32:47.065
a batch of reporters
got on with the pilot.


438
00:32:47.089 --> 00:32:48.369
They're waiting
to interview you.


439
00:32:48.508 --> 00:32:49.967
I can't see anybody
before breakfast.


440
00:32:50.259 --> 00:32:52.345
Say about 11:00? Look,
they're up in the lounge.


441
00:32:52.637 --> 00:32:54.239
And I can probably keep them
busy for a while,


442
00:32:54.263 --> 00:32:56.116
but I think it might be a
good idea to bring them


443
00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:57.367
down here and give them
a little drink and a sandwich


444
00:32:57.391 --> 00:32:58.391
just to sweeten them up.

445
00:32:58.559 --> 00:33:01.395
All right, you fix that up.

446
00:33:01.687 --> 00:33:04.398
Harvey, I'll see you after
breakfast. I have to collect myself.


447
00:33:04.690 --> 00:33:05.900
Oh, how do you feel?

448
00:33:06.192 --> 00:33:07.832
Oh, great. You know,
the stuff you gave me


449
00:33:08.069 --> 00:33:10.149
fixed me up fine. Good.
I'll see you after breakfast.


450
00:33:10.279 --> 00:33:12.323
(Stammering)
Right after breakfast.


451
00:33:15.368 --> 00:33:16.536
(Exhales)

452
00:33:33.469 --> 00:33:36.055
What... what do
you want, Hudson?


453
00:33:36.347 --> 00:33:38.808
To prepare your bath, sir.
I've had my bath.


454
00:33:41.602 --> 00:33:43.271
Just a moment.

455
00:33:43.563 --> 00:33:45.043
May I have the key,
if you don't mind?


456
00:33:54.073 --> 00:33:56.993
It's ogden. I beg your
pardon, your excellency.


457
00:33:57.285 --> 00:33:58.327
(Doorbell buzzes)

458
00:34:13.175 --> 00:34:15.219
Is that all, sir?
Yes, that's all.


459
00:34:15.511 --> 00:34:16.512
Thank you, sir.

460
00:34:24.186 --> 00:34:25.730
It's ogden. Hurry up.

461
00:34:27.648 --> 00:34:29.275
This door is broken. I know.

462
00:34:29.567 --> 00:34:31.687
Hurry up and eat your
breakfast. Yes, your excellency.


463
00:34:34.697 --> 00:34:38.492
Oh! Like a silver garden.

464
00:34:39.619 --> 00:34:41.621
(Softly) How lovely.

465
00:34:41.912 --> 00:34:44.206
Hurry up and eat! Oh! Yes, sir.

466
00:34:48.544 --> 00:34:51.505
I ordered boiled eggs and they've
scrambled them, but it doesn't matter.


467
00:34:51.797 --> 00:34:54.568
Will you please hurry up? We're gonna
be in Kobe in just a few minutes now.


468
00:34:54.592 --> 00:34:56.844
I'm doing my best, sir.

469
00:34:57.136 --> 00:34:59.016
You should have been up
and dressed an hour ago.


470
00:34:59.263 --> 00:35:01.515
But I haven't got
any clothes to wear.


471
00:35:01.807 --> 00:35:03.684
What? You...
You have a dress in there!


472
00:35:03.976 --> 00:35:05.436
That's for the evening.

473
00:35:05.728 --> 00:35:07.331
I can't appear at 11.00 in the
morning in an evening dress.


474
00:35:07.355 --> 00:35:09.440
Well, you should have
thought about that before.


475
00:35:09.732 --> 00:35:11.359
Now, wait a minute.

476
00:35:11.651 --> 00:35:13.920
There's a dress shop at the top
of the stairs. Ladies' dress shop.


477
00:35:13.944 --> 00:35:15.404
What are your measurements? Hmm?

478
00:35:15.696 --> 00:35:18.032
How tall are you?

479
00:35:18.324 --> 00:35:21.952
What about around here?
(Chuckles)


480
00:35:22.244 --> 00:35:24.497
Never mind that.
What about here?


481
00:35:24.789 --> 00:35:27.667
Modesty forbids. Oh!

482
00:35:27.958 --> 00:35:30.795
Now, listen. Remember
when I leave, lock both doors.


483
00:35:40.721 --> 00:35:42.181
(People talking indistinctly)

484
00:35:48.604 --> 00:35:50.147
Good morning, sir. Good morning.

485
00:35:50.439 --> 00:35:52.566
I'd like to have a lady's suit
for someone about 5'7".


486
00:35:52.858 --> 00:35:54.527
I'm afraid
we've nothing in stock.


487
00:35:54.819 --> 00:35:56.278
Well, what's all this?
Samples, sir.


488
00:35:56.570 --> 00:35:58.250
Our main stores are in
London and New York.


489
00:35:58.406 --> 00:35:59.699
Oh, I'll take anything you have.

490
00:35:59.990 --> 00:36:02.368
A complete lady's outfit
will be fine.


491
00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:03.661
Yes, sir.

492
00:36:14.213 --> 00:36:17.258
(Ship horn blows)

493
00:36:27.351 --> 00:36:29.395
(Knocking five times
in rhythm) Ogden!


494
00:36:34.734 --> 00:36:37.570
Here. Here's some clothes.

495
00:36:37.862 --> 00:36:40.340
Now, hurry up and get dressed. The
press is going to be here in five minutes.


496
00:36:40.364 --> 00:36:42.283
Yes, sir. (Exhales)

497
00:36:59.675 --> 00:37:02.052
Aren't you ready yet? I'm
trying to get ready, sir, but...


498
00:37:02.344 --> 00:37:03.624
You are not trying to get ready.

499
00:37:03.804 --> 00:37:05.639
I've had just about
enough of this.


500
00:37:05.931 --> 00:37:07.993
I'm not gonna stand... I gave
you my measurements, but...


501
00:37:08.017 --> 00:37:10.245
Listen, I'm not interested in the
problem of your measurements.


502
00:37:10.269 --> 00:37:11.705
I'm interested in you getting...
What is this for anyway?


503
00:37:11.729 --> 00:37:12.938
Out this door right now.

504
00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:14.990
If you're not off this
boat in two minutes...


505
00:37:15.149 --> 00:37:16.192
(Doorbell buzzes)

506
00:37:19.445 --> 00:37:21.197
Who is it? Steward, sir.

507
00:37:23.032 --> 00:37:24.950
Yes, sir?
Clear these things away.


508
00:37:25.242 --> 00:37:26.242
Yes, sir.

509
00:37:27.244 --> 00:37:28.244
(Sighs)

510
00:37:47.723 --> 00:37:51.018
Aren't you ready yet?
But it's all too big!


511
00:37:51.310 --> 00:37:52.686
Haven't they got
something smaller?


512
00:37:52.978 --> 00:37:54.814
That's the smallest they have.

513
00:37:55.105 --> 00:37:57.983
What am I to do? "Do"? Get
dressed and get off the boat!


514
00:37:58.275 --> 00:38:00.194
This is absurd.
I can't go ashore like this.


515
00:38:00.486 --> 00:38:01.766
I'd be arrested. 
They don't fit.

516
00:38:03.489 --> 00:38:04.573
Then you'll go as you are.

517
00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:08.536
In your pajamas?

518
00:38:08.828 --> 00:38:12.122
Take off those pajamas.
Would that look nice?


519
00:38:12.414 --> 00:38:15.125
Take off those pajamas
or I'll tear them off.


520
00:38:15.417 --> 00:38:18.587
(Gasps) Oh! You heard
what I said. Take 'em off.


521
00:38:18.879 --> 00:38:20.464
Oh, please, my nerves.

522
00:38:20.756 --> 00:38:22.466
Take them off.
Oh, this is silly.


523
00:38:22.758 --> 00:38:24.760
You'll see how
silly this is. Oh!


524
00:38:26.470 --> 00:38:27.470
Ahhh!

525
00:38:32.935 --> 00:38:34.478
Take 'em off.

526
00:38:34.770 --> 00:38:36.981
Oh, please. Do you want me
to call the captain?


527
00:38:37.273 --> 00:38:40.317
Oh, but this is absurd,
really. What are we doing?


528
00:38:40.609 --> 00:38:44.029
Ooh! Ooh! Oh, dear! Ooh.

529
00:38:44.321 --> 00:38:46.991
You'll get off this boat if I...

530
00:38:47.283 --> 00:38:48.826
(Doorbell buzzes) Who is it?

531
00:38:49.118 --> 00:38:50.286
It's Crawford, sir.

532
00:38:53.581 --> 00:38:56.250
Come in, ladies and
gentlemen. Please be seated.


533
00:38:56.542 --> 00:38:58.878
How do you do? Good morning.

534
00:38:59.169 --> 00:39:00.880
Good morning. Good morning.

535
00:39:17.146 --> 00:39:20.983
Ladies and gentlemen, may I
introduce his excellency, ogden mears?


536
00:39:21.275 --> 00:39:22.735
Woman: How do you do?
Good morning.


537
00:39:23.027 --> 00:39:24.862
How many
in your party, Mr. Mears?


538
00:39:25.154 --> 00:39:28.115
There are three of us, Mr. Crothers,
Mr. Crawford and myself.


539
00:39:28.407 --> 00:39:31.368
Mr. Mears, I understand you've been
made ambassador to Saudi Arabia.


540
00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:32.660
Yes, that's right.

541
00:39:32.828 --> 00:39:34.872
Are you going
directly there now?


542
00:39:35.164 --> 00:39:38.167
No, I'll go to Washington
for the usual formalities.


543
00:39:38.459 --> 00:39:41.921
Woman: Is your wife
going with you? I hope so.


544
00:39:42.212 --> 00:39:46.050
Man: Mr. Ambassador, what
is your solution for peace?


545
00:39:46.342 --> 00:39:50.137
The solution for peace
lies in man himself.


546
00:39:50.429 --> 00:39:52.139
In this atomic age (cork pops)

547
00:39:52.431 --> 00:39:53.849
And the power
of military might...


548
00:39:54.141 --> 00:39:55.221
Wait, I'll get you a towel.

549
00:39:55.434 --> 00:39:56.634
Liberty, freedom and justice

550
00:39:56.769 --> 00:39:59.480
are generalities that have been

551
00:39:59.772 --> 00:40:01.565
quoted as an excuse
for aggression.


552
00:40:01.857 --> 00:40:05.861
Natascha: Ah! Ogden:
Nature has given us the, uh,


553
00:40:06.153 --> 00:40:08.906
technological ability to

554
00:40:09.198 --> 00:40:12.743
military might, but is built
on the foundation of peace


555
00:40:13.035 --> 00:40:14.662
and goodwill to all men.

556
00:40:16.538 --> 00:40:18.832
And in this atomic age,

557
00:40:19.124 --> 00:40:22.920
only the morality of man
can help him to survive.


558
00:40:24.254 --> 00:40:26.256
The solution for peace
is in truth


559
00:40:26.548 --> 00:40:28.884
and tolerance and understanding.

560
00:40:30.135 --> 00:40:31.595
Thank you, gentlemen.

561
00:40:31.887 --> 00:40:33.323
Crawford: That will be all,
ladies and gentlemen.


562
00:40:33.347 --> 00:40:34.907
Steward: Refreshments
over here, please.


563
00:40:34.932 --> 00:40:36.600
Ogden, I've got to talk to you.

564
00:40:36.892 --> 00:40:38.352
Not now, old man. But, ogden!

565
00:40:38.644 --> 00:40:40.479
I'm sorry. I need rest.
I'm going back to bed.


566
00:40:40.771 --> 00:40:42.314
Are you kidding?

567
00:40:42.606 --> 00:40:44.608
A dame in your bathroom.
I went to get a towel.


568
00:40:46.568 --> 00:40:49.279
I'll talk to you about that
later on the promenade deck.


569
00:40:53.993 --> 00:40:56.829
She says she's a stowaway
and she's going to america.


570
00:40:57.121 --> 00:40:59.415
How did she get
into your pajamas?


571
00:40:59.707 --> 00:41:03.252
Hmm... like a fool, I loaned her
a pair of my pajamas to sleep in.


572
00:41:05.004 --> 00:41:07.047
(Bell dinging)

573
00:41:07.339 --> 00:41:09.633
Well, you'll have
to pay her off.


574
00:41:09.925 --> 00:41:12.970
I offered to pay her expenses back
to Hong Kong, but she won't take it.


575
00:41:13.262 --> 00:41:15.848
That's peanuts.
She's out for big dough.


576
00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:18.100
Why don't you get off the
boat and leave her flat?


577
00:41:18.392 --> 00:41:20.936
(Ship horn blows)

578
00:41:21.228 --> 00:41:23.022
Too late.

579
00:41:23.313 --> 00:41:25.458
Now listen, I've gotta do
something. I just can't leave her


580
00:41:25.482 --> 00:41:27.985
downstairs in that cabin
with my pajamas.


581
00:41:28.277 --> 00:41:32.322
I mean, it puts me in a terrible
spot. What am I gonna do?


582
00:41:32.614 --> 00:41:35.868
All right. Let's go to lunch and
aftennards you let me talk to her.


583
00:41:56.638 --> 00:41:58.098
(Key rattling)

584
00:42:05.439 --> 00:42:08.776
(Knocking five times
in rhythm) Mr. Mears.


585
00:42:09.068 --> 00:42:11.278
Oh! That's all right.
This is Mr. Crothers.


586
00:42:11.570 --> 00:42:13.590
You met him this morning
in the bathroom, I believe.


587
00:42:13.614 --> 00:42:16.992
How do you do? Well, I see
you've been playing chess.


588
00:42:17.284 --> 00:42:19.870
Alone? Yes.

589
00:42:20.162 --> 00:42:22.748
I took the Liberty of putting on
another pair of your pajamas


590
00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:25.459
after the other one
had been ripped off.


591
00:42:25.751 --> 00:42:27.461
Where's the torn one?

592
00:42:27.753 --> 00:42:30.214
Oh, I hid it. I didn't think
you wanted anyone to see it.


593
00:42:30.506 --> 00:42:32.341
(Yells) You think I
give a damn who sees it?


594
00:42:32.633 --> 00:42:34.218
You spoiled my move.

595
00:42:34.510 --> 00:42:37.030
Now, now, ogden. Let's settle
this thing without any bitterness.


596
00:42:38.222 --> 00:42:39.348
Natascha,

597
00:42:41.767 --> 00:42:43.560
I understand you want
to go to america.


598
00:42:43.852 --> 00:42:45.687
Yes. Good.

599
00:42:45.979 --> 00:42:49.358
Now, ogden tells me that you
have neither a passport nor a visa.


600
00:42:49.650 --> 00:42:51.151
I don't need them.

601
00:42:51.443 --> 00:42:53.043
What makes you think
you don't need them?


602
00:42:53.112 --> 00:42:55.239
Because I haven't
got them. Fair enough.


603
00:42:55.531 --> 00:42:58.534
You see, she's insane.
Because I haven't a passport?


604
00:42:58.826 --> 00:43:01.745
What's this use
of arguing with her?


605
00:43:02.037 --> 00:43:04.248
Natascha, don't you realize
that you'll be caught?


606
00:43:04.540 --> 00:43:06.083
I have no intention
of being caught.


607
00:43:06.375 --> 00:43:08.335
But you have to pass
the immigration officers.


608
00:43:08.627 --> 00:43:10.462
So what? (Doorbell buzzes)

609
00:43:17.386 --> 00:43:19.638
Who is it? Chief steward, sir.

610
00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:24.226
Excuse me. Do you mind
closing all your portholes, sir?


611
00:43:24.518 --> 00:43:26.353
Yes, it seems to be
blowing up out there.


612
00:43:26.645 --> 00:43:29.982
Just a little sloppy. Nothing
serious. (Chuckles) Yes.


613
00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:34.528
All clear.

614
00:43:38.574 --> 00:43:42.786
What are you hiding for?
Me? I don't know.


615
00:43:43.078 --> 00:43:45.038
However, let's get down
to business.


616
00:43:51.962 --> 00:43:52.962
Natascha,

617
00:43:54.673 --> 00:43:56.133
I like you.

618
00:43:56.425 --> 00:43:59.052
And I think I'm a good
judge of character.


619
00:43:59.344 --> 00:44:02.264
You mustn't mind ogden. He's
a little abrupt, but he means well.


620
00:44:02.556 --> 00:44:04.308
Well, you mean well,

621
00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:06.977
but he hasn't approached
you in the right way.


622
00:44:07.269 --> 00:44:09.062
I'm sure you don't
want to ruin his career.


623
00:44:09.354 --> 00:44:11.481
All I want is to get to america.

624
00:44:11.773 --> 00:44:13.400
Well, that can be arranged,

625
00:44:13.692 --> 00:44:15.612
if you'll get off at Tokyo
and take another boat.


626
00:44:26.747 --> 00:44:30.250
If you get off at Tokyo,
I'll give you $25,000.


627
00:44:30.542 --> 00:44:32.753
You don't seem to understand.
I don't want money.


628
00:44:33.045 --> 00:44:35.505
This is a trick and you're
not getting away with it.


629
00:44:35.797 --> 00:44:37.549
Natascha, how much do you want?

630
00:44:37.841 --> 00:44:39.051
I don't want money.

631
00:44:40.177 --> 00:44:42.012
And I don't want this.

632
00:44:42.304 --> 00:44:44.932
We'll give you $50,000.
Oh, there's no use in arguing.


633
00:44:45.224 --> 00:44:47.864
Best thing to do is go to the
captain and tell him the whole story.


634
00:44:48.143 --> 00:44:51.438
Then I'll tell him my side. How you
kidnapped me, locked me in your cabin,


635
00:44:51.730 --> 00:44:53.982
and after attacking me,
tried to get rid of me.


636
00:44:54.274 --> 00:44:56.109
Do you think I give a hoot
for your threats?


637
00:44:59.571 --> 00:45:01.114
(Groans)

638
00:45:01.406 --> 00:45:02.699
Now, wait a minute.

639
00:45:02.991 --> 00:45:04.534
This is getting us nowhere.

640
00:45:05.410 --> 00:45:06.954
Ogden,

641
00:45:07.246 --> 00:45:09.039
you can catch
more flies with honey


642
00:45:10.499 --> 00:45:12.209
than you can with...

643
00:45:12.501 --> 00:45:14.253
With what?

644
00:45:14.544 --> 00:45:16.630
Harvey: Well, I'd say
mustard or vinegar.


645
00:45:18.757 --> 00:45:20.509
Mustard and vinegar?

646
00:45:20.801 --> 00:45:22.344
What's that got to do with it?

647
00:45:28.809 --> 00:45:32.562
Well, you can get more
with honey. Honey, huh.


648
00:45:32.854 --> 00:45:36.191
Now, listen, natascha. If
ogden goes to the captain,


649
00:45:36.483 --> 00:45:40.862
he'll believe him before he'll
believe you, and you'll be sent to jail.


650
00:45:41.154 --> 00:45:46.410
If you'll get off the boat at Tokyo
without a scandal, we'll give you $75,000.


651
00:45:46.702 --> 00:45:49.079
I don't want money. (Hiccups)

652
00:45:51.623 --> 00:45:53.917
Ogden, you're dealing
with an odd character.


653
00:45:54.209 --> 00:45:56.545
This is a hold-up. I'm going
straight to the captain.


654
00:45:58.088 --> 00:45:59.756
Don't do anything rash, ogden.

655
00:46:05.554 --> 00:46:06.554
Ogden?

656
00:46:08.974 --> 00:46:11.893
Ogden, before you do
anything... (Ogden groans)


657
00:46:22.904 --> 00:46:24.573
(Wind howling)

658
00:46:33.999 --> 00:46:34.999
Ogden: Out!

659
00:46:38.253 --> 00:46:39.755
What do you think you're doing?

660
00:46:42.049 --> 00:46:43.049
Oh.

661
00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:49.056
Harvey, ring for some ice water.

662
00:46:58.523 --> 00:47:00.108
You leave this cabin
immediately.


663
00:47:45.779 --> 00:47:48.198
Well, good morning, ogden.
Hello, harv.


664
00:47:48.490 --> 00:47:50.450
How do you feel? Wonderful.

665
00:47:50.742 --> 00:47:52.035
Good.

666
00:47:52.327 --> 00:47:53.703
Say, you had quite
a siege of it.


667
00:47:53.995 --> 00:47:56.206
You know, for a while there,
I thought it was serious.


668
00:47:56.498 --> 00:47:58.083
Well, it was a touch
of the old malaria.


669
00:47:58.375 --> 00:47:59.615
I get it every once in a while.

670
00:47:59.751 --> 00:48:02.003
But now I feel great. Good.

671
00:48:02.295 --> 00:48:04.381
Say, uh, how's the
situation down below?


672
00:48:06.258 --> 00:48:07.968
I don't know what to think.

673
00:48:08.260 --> 00:48:10.860
You know, she stayed up two days
and nights dosing me with quinine


674
00:48:11.012 --> 00:48:13.140
and taking my temperature.

675
00:48:13.432 --> 00:48:15.192
She even wanted to send
for the ship's doctor


676
00:48:15.308 --> 00:48:16.369
when she thought
it was getting serious.


677
00:48:16.393 --> 00:48:18.270
Of course I stopped her.

678
00:48:18.562 --> 00:48:20.272
Well, in three days
we arrive in Honolulu,


679
00:48:20.564 --> 00:48:21.815
then she says she'll disappear.

680
00:48:23.108 --> 00:48:24.151
I'll miss her.

681
00:48:24.943 --> 00:48:27.362
So will I.

682
00:48:27.654 --> 00:48:31.074
I'll miss the tension,
the excitement of it all.


683
00:48:33.577 --> 00:48:35.412
(Music playing)

684
00:48:35.704 --> 00:48:37.205
(People chattering indistinctly)

685
00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:46.882
We were wondering
what had become of you.


686
00:48:47.174 --> 00:48:49.551
Well, I... I hope you
haven't been seasick.


687
00:48:49.843 --> 00:48:53.221
Actually, it was quite something
else. Everybody's been seasick.


688
00:48:53.513 --> 00:48:56.308
At least it'll give them
something to talk about at dinner.


689
00:48:56.600 --> 00:48:58.685
How sick they were,
what they ate.


690
00:48:58.977 --> 00:49:01.188
Daddy says it's surprising
what people will talk about


691
00:49:01.480 --> 00:49:02.720
to make themselves interesting.

692
00:49:13.867 --> 00:49:15.410
(Samba music playing)

693
00:49:19.998 --> 00:49:22.834
I can't do that.
Oh, yes, you can.


694
00:49:23.126 --> 00:49:24.126
I'll show you.

695
00:49:25.170 --> 00:49:27.964
There. Isn't it wonderful?

696
00:49:28.256 --> 00:49:31.676
I think dancing
stimulates conversation.


697
00:49:31.968 --> 00:49:34.346
Wasn't it Aristotle
who used to walk and lecture


698
00:49:34.638 --> 00:49:37.140
around the lyceum
and talk of the soul?


699
00:49:37.432 --> 00:49:41.144
Though daddy says he never
had a clear idea of what the soul is.


700
00:49:41.436 --> 00:49:42.979
But daddy has.

701
00:49:43.271 --> 00:49:45.732
He says the soul is desire.

702
00:49:46.024 --> 00:49:48.360
And that the whole of life is
desire. (Voice vibrates)


703
00:49:48.652 --> 00:49:51.112
I think it's a wonderful idea.

704
00:49:51.404 --> 00:49:53.490
Well, if you can't shimmy,
we'll just dance ordinary.


705
00:49:58.662 --> 00:50:02.165
Do you believe in the
immortality of the soul?


706
00:50:02.457 --> 00:50:05.168
Well... daddy does. He
believes that when we die,


707
00:50:05.460 --> 00:50:09.130
our souls go on until they're
reborn again through love.


708
00:50:09.422 --> 00:50:11.675
Love? You don't believe in love?

709
00:50:11.967 --> 00:50:14.094
Well, I... daddy does.

710
00:50:14.386 --> 00:50:18.765
He loves everybody, except
the communists. (Laughs)


711
00:50:19.057 --> 00:50:22.185
You're in the diplomatic
service, aren't you? Yes.


712
00:50:22.477 --> 00:50:26.231
How boring it must be to
be diplomatic to everyone.


713
00:50:26.523 --> 00:50:28.817
But you're ambassador
to Arabia, aren't you?


714
00:50:29.109 --> 00:50:30.944
Yes, I...
Have you been there before?


715
00:50:31.236 --> 00:50:32.279
Oh, yes.

716
00:50:32.571 --> 00:50:34.781
Do tell me about it.
I adore arabs.


717
00:50:35.073 --> 00:50:36.353
Well, the arabs
are very inter...


718
00:50:36.491 --> 00:50:37.909
Quite a crowd tonight.

719
00:50:38.201 --> 00:50:40.870
You'd never suspect that
most of them have been seasick.


720
00:50:41.162 --> 00:50:44.874
One passenger has been confined to
her cabin ever since we left Hong Kong.


721
00:50:45.166 --> 00:50:47.711
Her empty chair is next
to mine in the dining room.


722
00:50:48.003 --> 00:50:50.755
I'm so intrigued to see
what she looks like.


723
00:50:55.760 --> 00:50:58.096
(Knocking five times
in rhythm) It's Harvey!


724
00:51:02.017 --> 00:51:04.185
Peek-a-boo.

725
00:51:04.477 --> 00:51:07.063
Well, I... I see
you're enjoying yourself.


726
00:51:07.355 --> 00:51:10.650
I just thought I'd come down to see
that you weren't getting into any mischief.


727
00:51:10.942 --> 00:51:14.654
Mischief? Well, it's
a difficult situation.


728
00:51:14.946 --> 00:51:17.198
(Sighs) I'll be glad
when it's over.


729
00:51:17.490 --> 00:51:19.610
You really think you'll be
able to land in the states?


730
00:51:19.868 --> 00:51:21.369
Oh, yes.

731
00:51:21.661 --> 00:51:24.247
I sincerely wish you
all the luck in the world.


732
00:51:24.539 --> 00:51:25.540
And I know ogden does.

733
00:51:26.916 --> 00:51:28.251
Ogden?

734
00:51:28.543 --> 00:51:31.963
Oh, yes, he...
He speaks very well of you.


735
00:51:32.255 --> 00:51:33.381
That's surprising.

736
00:51:33.673 --> 00:51:35.717
Well, it's all difficult.

737
00:51:36.009 --> 00:51:39.429
These close quarters. He's very
suspicious. You're very attractive.


738
00:51:39.721 --> 00:51:41.389
That's what
he's fighting against.


739
00:51:43.016 --> 00:51:45.435
He seems to have won.

740
00:51:45.727 --> 00:51:48.396
Unfortunately, it started
out the wrong way.


741
00:51:48.688 --> 00:51:51.816
But he'll miss you. Hmm.

742
00:51:52.108 --> 00:51:55.153
Oh, yes. He said so himself.

743
00:51:55.445 --> 00:51:57.864
He'll be only too glad
to get rid of me.


744
00:51:58.156 --> 00:52:00.116
Mmm... I don't know.

745
00:52:00.408 --> 00:52:03.244
What's he doing upstairs?
Dancing with some young blonde.


746
00:52:06.122 --> 00:52:08.416
Is she pretty?
Well, she's young.


747
00:52:10.335 --> 00:52:13.129
Hey, what are you doing? You
put the five in the wrong place.


748
00:52:14.255 --> 00:52:15.840
(Door unlocking)

749
00:52:19.552 --> 00:52:21.012
Oh. Electrician, sir,

750
00:52:21.304 --> 00:52:23.240
to fix the lights in the sitting
room and the bedroom.


751
00:52:23.264 --> 00:52:25.558
Could you come back in
half an hour? Very well, sir.


752
00:52:27.769 --> 00:52:30.689
It's the electrician to fix the
lights here and in the bedroom.


753
00:52:30.980 --> 00:52:33.274
They've been here every 10
minutes, rapping on the door.


754
00:52:33.566 --> 00:52:37.445
Now they have a passkey.
Idonthke that passkey business.


755
00:52:37.737 --> 00:52:40.031
I think you'd be safer
upstairs dancing.


756
00:52:40.323 --> 00:52:42.242
Ogden would be furious.

757
00:52:42.534 --> 00:52:45.578
Oh, no. Not when I tell him about
the electrician with the passkey.


758
00:52:45.870 --> 00:52:48.350
Well, if I'm caught, it's better
to be upstairs than down here.


759
00:52:48.623 --> 00:52:52.001
Ah. Now that's the spirit! Listen, if
you stay down here, you'll go stir crazy.


760
00:52:52.293 --> 00:52:56.131
(Orchestra playing waltz music)

761
00:53:20.572 --> 00:53:22.652
You stay here. I'll find
ogden. Don't leave me alone!


762
00:53:22.824 --> 00:53:24.367
No, no, no.
I'll only be a minute.


763
00:53:24.659 --> 00:53:26.262
Excuse me. May I have the
pleasure of this dance? (Gasps)


764
00:53:26.286 --> 00:53:27.746
Harvey! Harvey!

765
00:53:28.037 --> 00:53:29.539
No, no. It's all right.
Go ahead.


766
00:53:29.831 --> 00:53:31.791
How do you do? Thank
you. I'll meet you back here.


767
00:53:39.424 --> 00:53:40.675
(Talking indistinctly)

768
00:53:44.095 --> 00:53:45.847
Why aren't you dancing, captain?

769
00:53:46.139 --> 00:53:48.600
I was just about to ask this
very attractive young lady.


770
00:53:48.892 --> 00:53:51.853
You better be nice to him. We're
all under his control, you know.


771
00:53:57.817 --> 00:54:00.320
I've been wondering about
the immortality of the soul.


772
00:54:07.327 --> 00:54:09.204
Bandleader:
Change your partners.


773
00:54:16.795 --> 00:54:18.671
Change your partners.

774
00:54:25.053 --> 00:54:27.305
I don't think I've seen you
throughout the voyage.


775
00:54:27.597 --> 00:54:29.867
But of course, you're the lady
who's been confined to her cabin.


776
00:54:29.891 --> 00:54:30.892
Yes, yes.

777
00:54:31.184 --> 00:54:32.578
It's a pity you're such
a poor sailor.


778
00:54:32.602 --> 00:54:34.187
However, that's our misfortune.

779
00:54:41.736 --> 00:54:44.739
Change your partners.
Thank you so much.


780
00:54:56.084 --> 00:54:57.961
Why did you leave the room?

781
00:54:58.253 --> 00:55:00.880
The electricians wanted to fix
the lights. They have a passkey.


782
00:55:01.172 --> 00:55:03.383
You mean they saw you?
Of course not.


783
00:55:03.675 --> 00:55:06.469
Harvey answered the door.
What was he doing in there?


784
00:55:06.761 --> 00:55:09.973
I'm lucky he was there. Otherwise,
they would have seen me.


785
00:55:10.265 --> 00:55:12.183
What were you and the
captain talking about?


786
00:55:12.475 --> 00:55:14.060
He asked me
if I was enjoying the trip.


787
00:55:14.352 --> 00:55:17.146
What did you tell him?
I said every moment of it.


788
00:55:25.405 --> 00:55:27.031
Change your partners.

789
00:55:33.037 --> 00:55:36.833
Natascha! What are you doing
away from Hong Kong?


790
00:55:37.125 --> 00:55:39.669
I'm going to San Francisco.
Alone?


791
00:55:39.961 --> 00:55:41.588
I'm looking for a job.

792
00:55:41.880 --> 00:55:43.941
You don't have to look
far, honey. I'll give you a job.


793
00:55:43.965 --> 00:55:46.593
Oh, no. I'm not looking
for that kind of work.


794
00:55:46.885 --> 00:55:48.094
(Chuckung)

795
00:55:56.853 --> 00:55:59.564
Where have you been? I haven't
seen you around the whole trip.


796
00:55:59.856 --> 00:56:01.096
I've been confined to my cabin.

797
00:56:01.357 --> 00:56:02.984
What, have you been
hiding from someone?


798
00:56:03.276 --> 00:56:06.738
Mmm... I've been very, very
sick. Where is your cabin?


799
00:56:07.030 --> 00:56:09.866
None of your business. All
right, I'll find out from the purser.


800
00:56:10.158 --> 00:56:12.076
(Trumpet playing)

801
00:56:19.459 --> 00:56:20.899
Let's go to the bar
and have a drink.


802
00:56:21.127 --> 00:56:23.046
Oh, no, I'm very tired.
I'm going to bed.


803
00:56:23.338 --> 00:56:25.131
Then I'll go with you.
Oh, no, you won't.


804
00:56:25.423 --> 00:56:27.800
Then have a drink. No, I'm
going straight to my cabin.


805
00:56:28.092 --> 00:56:29.732
Listen, you can't
get rid of me that easy.


806
00:56:29.886 --> 00:56:31.220
I'm either going to your cabin

807
00:56:31.512 --> 00:56:32.752
or we're going to have a drink.

808
00:56:34.265 --> 00:56:35.350
I'll have a drink.

809
00:56:40.605 --> 00:56:43.858
I told her to meet me
here. Where are they?


810
00:56:44.150 --> 00:56:46.861
Oh, there they are at the bar.

811
00:56:47.153 --> 00:56:49.697
I wonder what they're talking
about. Let's go and listen.


812
00:57:03.294 --> 00:57:05.546
(Coughing)

813
00:57:11.135 --> 00:57:13.638
Yes, sir. A Martini.

814
00:57:13.930 --> 00:57:15.139
And you? Been

815
00:57:16.808 --> 00:57:19.936
hey, come on now, honey,
where is your cabin?


816
00:57:20.228 --> 00:57:23.314
Wouldn't you like to know? Oh,
come clean, honey. Don't play the virgin.


817
00:57:23.606 --> 00:57:25.400
Virgin? What's that?

818
00:57:25.692 --> 00:57:28.069
I see I'll have to teach
you the facts of life.


819
00:57:29.612 --> 00:57:31.781
Now listen, honey, I...

820
00:57:40.415 --> 00:57:44.794
Still playing hard to get,
eh? No, hard to please.


821
00:57:45.086 --> 00:57:47.505
What's wrong with me? Have
I got leprosy or something?


822
00:57:48.840 --> 00:57:49.966
Yes.

823
00:57:50.258 --> 00:57:52.593
Whether I have or not,
I'm going with you.


824
00:57:59.183 --> 00:58:00.536
They must be
in the other corridor.


825
00:58:00.560 --> 00:58:01.620
I'll go round,
meet them face on.


826
00:58:01.644 --> 00:58:02.644
Okay.

827
00:58:05.023 --> 00:58:08.151
Oh, natascha, come on.
Really, I must say good night.


828
00:58:08.443 --> 00:58:12.113
Why the anticlimax? Hey,
hello, chum! How've you been?


829
00:58:12.405 --> 00:58:14.991
Say, how's the wife?
Who are you?


830
00:58:15.283 --> 00:58:18.327
Are you kidding? I'm the brother of
that guy who sold you the used Pontiac.


831
00:58:18.619 --> 00:58:20.705
Come on now. Let's have
a drink. I don't know you.


832
00:58:20.997 --> 00:58:23.397
Of course you do. You've
been talking to my sister all night.


833
00:58:23.541 --> 00:58:25.626
That's not your sister.
It's not my uncle.


834
00:58:38.014 --> 00:58:39.807
(Knocking seven
times in rhythm) Ogden.


835
00:58:51.569 --> 00:58:55.948
I hope you enjoyed yourself, letting
everybody know you were here.


836
00:58:56.240 --> 00:58:58.534
Flaunting and parading
around this ship.


837
00:58:58.826 --> 00:59:03.748
What are you trying to do?
Ruin my career, destroy me?


838
00:59:04.040 --> 00:59:06.542
You know, I was beginning
to believe in you, to trust you.


839
00:59:06.834 --> 00:59:09.879
I thought there was something
decent, something worthwhile.


840
00:59:10.171 --> 00:59:11.839
But you're just a common harlot.

841
00:59:20.431 --> 00:59:23.059
Dragging me into
your sordid intrigues.


842
00:59:23.351 --> 00:59:25.645
Leering into the face of that
stupid paramour of yours.


843
00:59:25.937 --> 00:59:27.939
Why don't you go and hide
in his cabin?


844
00:59:28.231 --> 00:59:30.483
Why don't you torment him?

845
00:59:30.775 --> 00:59:33.361
I won't torment you anylongen

846
00:59:33.653 --> 00:59:35.655
it has not been cheerful
for me either


847
00:59:35.947 --> 00:59:38.950
having to endure
your contempt every day.


848
00:59:39.242 --> 00:59:40.952
I thought I could take it,
but I can't.


849
00:59:42.286 --> 00:59:43.286
You win.

850
00:59:51.003 --> 00:59:54.048
(Groans) No. No, I won't.

851
00:59:56.092 --> 00:59:57.218
You're crazy.

852
01:00:01.180 --> 01:00:02.180
Maybe.

853
01:00:07.311 --> 01:00:10.940
Where are you going? To
the purser and give myself up.


854
01:00:11.232 --> 01:00:15.111
Oh, don't worry. I'll keep your
spotless reputation out of it.


855
01:00:15.403 --> 01:00:17.321
I'll tell him I've been
hiding in second class.


856
01:00:17.613 --> 01:00:19.115
Why this sudden change
of attitude?


857
01:00:21.993 --> 01:00:24.954
Why yours? You know why.

858
01:00:43.598 --> 01:00:47.935
Good morning, purser. Could you tell
me the cabin number of Ms. Natascha...


859
01:00:48.227 --> 01:00:50.387
I don't know her other name,
but I know her quite well.


860
01:00:50.479 --> 01:00:52.690
Perhaps you mean
Ms. Gaulswallow. Who?


861
01:00:52.982 --> 01:00:55.067
Gaulswallow.

862
01:00:55.359 --> 01:00:58.404
Uh, yeah, I guess so. I don't
think she wants to be disturbed.


863
01:00:58.696 --> 01:01:00.698
Okay, but I'd like to
send her some flowers.


864
01:01:01.782 --> 01:01:03.326
(Sniffing)

865
01:01:11.500 --> 01:01:13.753
Flowers for Ms. Gaulswallow.

866
01:01:17.089 --> 01:01:19.675
Oh, dear, dear.
I don't know him.


867
01:01:21.385 --> 01:01:25.598
Oh, take them away.
They take up all the oxygen.


868
01:01:25.890 --> 01:01:27.516
They take up all the oxygen.

869
01:01:31.562 --> 01:01:34.357
Anna pooh, my old friend.

870
01:01:34.649 --> 01:01:36.651
Oh, that red tongue!

871
01:01:37.735 --> 01:01:39.028
Nurse!

872
01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:41.405
Oh, take my Russian friend away.

873
01:01:41.697 --> 01:01:42.698
He's too big

874
01:01:42.990 --> 01:01:45.201
and I don't like his red tongue.

875
01:01:45.493 --> 01:01:48.287
Oh, oh, more colors.

876
01:01:50.498 --> 01:01:53.042
Oh, not that.
No more of that. No.


877
01:01:53.334 --> 01:01:55.836
Idonthke the green
either. Put that right away.


878
01:01:57.255 --> 01:01:59.715
Ooh! How awful.

879
01:02:00.007 --> 01:02:01.342
In the drawer, please.

880
01:02:04.387 --> 01:02:05.763
Give me the chocolates.

881
01:02:09.934 --> 01:02:11.143
The captain, madam.

882
01:02:11.435 --> 01:02:13.604
Well, I... I...

883
01:02:13.896 --> 01:02:17.984
Captain! Oh, how nice of you.

884
01:02:19.652 --> 01:02:20.903
Chocolates.

885
01:02:22.488 --> 01:02:25.241
Oh, how perfectly charming.

886
01:02:25.533 --> 01:02:29.954
(Sighs) Nurse, will you
put these by the porthole?


887
01:02:30.246 --> 01:02:32.873
Just the sort of thing
my nephews will enjoy.


888
01:02:35.501 --> 01:02:37.253
Nurse! My thermometer.

889
01:02:39.714 --> 01:02:42.425
Give it to me.
I'll shake the thing myself.


890
01:02:47.388 --> 01:02:49.598
(Knocking on door)
(Muttering indistinctly)


891
01:02:52.810 --> 01:02:55.813
Nurse, where's my thermometer?

892
01:02:56.105 --> 01:02:59.191
I've lost my thermometer.
Or did I swallow it?


893
01:03:03.070 --> 01:03:04.238
Ms. Gaulswallow: Come in!

894
01:03:10.494 --> 01:03:14.540
What was that? Something
flew in and then flew out.


895
01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.627
Must have been a bat. (Laughing)

896
01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:37.021
The man that looked after you since
you were 14, was he a white Russian?


897
01:03:37.313 --> 01:03:38.313
Yes.

898
01:03:40.733 --> 01:03:41.734
Was he married?

899
01:03:43.027 --> 01:03:45.738
Yes. Separated from his wife.

900
01:03:47.907 --> 01:03:50.451
He was a desperate man.

901
01:03:50.743 --> 01:03:53.120
They say he was a gangster,
but he was very kind to me.


902
01:03:54.955 --> 01:03:56.749
God knows what I would
have done without him.


903
01:03:57.875 --> 01:03:58.959
Did you love him?

904
01:04:00.878 --> 01:04:01.962
I was too young.

905
01:04:02.922 --> 01:04:04.090
How old was he?

906
01:04:05.716 --> 01:04:07.760
Sixty-three when he died.

907
01:04:14.183 --> 01:04:15.226
What's the matter?

908
01:04:16.727 --> 01:04:17.978
Me? Nothing.

909
01:04:19.980 --> 01:04:23.943
Are you sure? Of course.

910
01:04:24.235 --> 01:04:27.530
At 10:00, I have to look for
Crawford and send some cablegrams.


911
01:04:29.323 --> 01:04:31.367
You look worried.

912
01:04:31.659 --> 01:04:35.204
(Sighs) I'm just wondering how
you're going to land in the states.


913
01:04:35.496 --> 01:04:37.665
Please don't worry about it.

914
01:04:37.957 --> 01:04:42.128
You have to be realistic. In two
days, you're going to be in Hawaii.


915
01:04:42.420 --> 01:04:46.757
Yes, I'm getting off there. It will be
easier getting into the states that way.


916
01:04:47.049 --> 01:04:51.929
Suppose you get into trouble.
Whatever happens, you won't be involved.


917
01:04:52.221 --> 01:04:56.267
You have to be realistic, face
facts. What are your plans?


918
01:04:56.559 --> 01:05:00.146
I can supply you with money, but
suppose you do get into trouble?


919
01:05:00.438 --> 01:05:04.024
I'd like to be of some help.
Please don't feel obligated.


920
01:05:04.316 --> 01:05:07.027
The moment we arrive in
Honolulu, I shall have vanished.


921
01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:11.490
You're so remote, so alone.

922
01:05:12.491 --> 01:05:13.491
That's what saddens me.

923
01:05:15.327 --> 01:05:18.330
Don't be sad. That's too easy.

924
01:05:19.623 --> 01:05:20.666
Be like me.

925
01:05:23.294 --> 01:05:25.463
At this moment, 
I'm very happy.

926
01:05:26.338 --> 01:05:27.339
This moment.

927
01:05:28.632 --> 01:05:29.842
That's all we can ask for.

928
01:05:30.634 --> 01:05:31.719
This moment.

929
01:05:33.637 --> 01:05:36.182
(Chuckles)
There'll be many moments.


930
01:05:37.308 --> 01:05:38.684
I wonder.

931
01:05:38.976 --> 01:05:39.976
Of course.

932
01:05:42.271 --> 01:05:45.357
Our lives are so different,
so far apart.


933
01:05:45.649 --> 01:05:47.067
No need to be,
if we're discreet.


934
01:05:50.029 --> 01:05:51.447
I hate to leave, but it's 10:00

935
01:05:51.739 --> 01:05:53.139
and I have to send
those cablegrams.


936
01:05:56.285 --> 01:05:58.454
Oh. Don't worry.

937
01:05:58.746 --> 01:06:00.206
I want to help, and I can.

938
01:06:00.498 --> 01:06:02.249
But I must know your plans.

939
01:06:04.251 --> 01:06:07.546
And meanwhile, don't vanish.
We still have two more days.


940
01:06:07.838 --> 01:06:08.838
I won't.

941
01:06:32.863 --> 01:06:34.573
(Knocking on door) It's Harvey.

942
01:06:43.123 --> 01:06:44.833
(Laughs) Good morning.

943
01:06:45.125 --> 01:06:47.253
I just met your boyfriend
who pursued you last night.


944
01:06:47.545 --> 01:06:48.897
He's still roaming
all around the boat,


945
01:06:48.921 --> 01:06:50.081
looking for your room number.

946
01:06:53.968 --> 01:06:55.719
Am I intruding? (Sniffles)

947
01:06:58.973 --> 01:07:00.140
Two more days.

948
01:07:02.518 --> 01:07:04.853
Yep. I could see it coming.

949
01:07:06.438 --> 01:07:07.898
Both of you falling in love.

950
01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:10.568
I don't know about ogden,

951
01:07:12.069 --> 01:07:13.779
but this is
a new experience for me.


952
01:07:15.739 --> 01:07:18.158
Well, it happens in the best
of regulated families.


953
01:07:19.910 --> 01:07:21.495
I don't want to fall in love.

954
01:07:23.414 --> 01:07:24.957
I think he's very fond of you.

955
01:07:29.253 --> 01:07:30.921
However, if you ever
got into trouble,


956
01:07:31.213 --> 01:07:33.215
his friendship
could be very useful.


957
01:07:33.507 --> 01:07:35.426
Oh, it's all so hopeless.

958
01:07:37.052 --> 01:07:38.178
I don't agree.

959
01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:41.682
Well, in two days,
it will be over.


960
01:07:44.476 --> 01:07:47.896
You're leaving at Honolulu? Yes.

961
01:07:48.188 --> 01:07:50.028
Have you thought about
what you're going to do?


962
01:07:50.899 --> 01:07:52.318
I have a plan.

963
01:07:52.610 --> 01:07:53.986
Well, it better be a good one.

964
01:07:56.488 --> 01:07:58.240
Harvey?

965
01:07:58.532 --> 01:08:01.368
If I tell you, promise me
you won't tell ogden.


966
01:08:01.660 --> 01:08:05.831
Why? He's very
conservative. He might object.


967
01:08:06.123 --> 01:08:09.251
What are you going to do?
Dive off the boat.


968
01:08:09.543 --> 01:08:12.588
Oh, honey, where did you get
that idea? You'll break your neck!


969
01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:16.258
Oh, no, no. In Hawaii, they come
around in little boats and dive for money.


970
01:08:16.550 --> 01:08:19.678
Some climb aboard and
dive off the boat. I can do that.


971
01:08:19.970 --> 01:08:22.431
(On radio) J“ why
do stars shine so bright


972
01:08:22.723 --> 01:08:25.726
j“ why does the nightingale
sing at night


973
01:08:26.018 --> 01:08:29.271
j“ because they believe
in love j“


974
01:08:29.563 --> 01:08:31.732
(music fades away)

975
01:08:45.913 --> 01:08:48.624
(Music starts loudly)

976
01:08:50.959 --> 01:08:54.296
J“ why should I look and sigh

977
01:08:54.588 --> 01:08:58.175
how fortunate that
my chair's next to yours.


978
01:08:58.467 --> 01:08:59.760
J“ I believe in love j“

979
01:09:00.052 --> 01:09:01.220
here, I'll turn this off.

980
01:09:02.012 --> 01:09:03.389
Now we can talk.

981
01:09:06.183 --> 01:09:10.062
But I'm interrupting your
reading. How inconsiderate of me.


982
01:09:10.354 --> 01:09:14.066
Nothing's more annoying than to
have someone interrupt your reading.


983
01:09:14.358 --> 01:09:17.277
Daddy says it's a lack of
consideration for other people.


984
01:09:19.154 --> 01:09:21.740
Where's your friend,
the ambassador?


985
01:09:22.032 --> 01:09:25.994
He seems to have erased himself
completely during the voyage.


986
01:09:26.286 --> 01:09:29.832
Daddy says that people who erase
themselves usually have a profound shyness


987
01:09:30.124 --> 01:09:32.960
which really means that they're
afraid of exposing themselves.


988
01:09:34.044 --> 01:09:35.044
Hmm.

989
01:09:37.172 --> 01:09:39.800
Oh, the silence is frightening.

990
01:09:40.092 --> 01:09:41.635
Would you like some more music?

991
01:09:46.724 --> 01:09:49.393
Radio announcer: Mrs. Martha
mears, wife of ambassador ogden mears


992
01:09:49.685 --> 01:09:52.855
will await her husband's
arrival in Honolulu this evening.


993
01:09:53.147 --> 01:09:55.607
Rumors have been rife that
the ambassador and his wife


994
01:09:55.899 --> 01:09:57.818
are getting a divorce.

995
01:09:58.110 --> 01:10:01.739
Nevertheless, Mrs. Ogden mears says she
will accompany her husband to Washington.


996
01:10:02.030 --> 01:10:04.742
He's getting a divorce!
Excuse me.


997
01:10:11.749 --> 01:10:14.469
Your wife's waiting for you in
Honolulu. It just came over the radio.


998
01:10:14.543 --> 01:10:16.712
I know. I just got a telegram.

999
01:10:17.004 --> 01:10:18.273
She's coming aboard this evening

1000
01:10:18.297 --> 01:10:19.673
and she's not getting a divorce.

1001
01:10:19.965 --> 01:10:20.965
What about natascha?

1002
01:10:22.050 --> 01:10:23.677
Oh, that's the problem.

1003
01:10:23.969 --> 01:10:26.472
You've got to think fast.
We arrive at 9:30.


1004
01:10:26.764 --> 01:10:30.184
You've got to get her out of your
cabin! Oh, where's she gonna go?


1005
01:10:30.476 --> 01:10:33.020
Well, she can sleep
in my cabin. That's out.


1006
01:10:33.312 --> 01:10:35.773
(Ship horn blowing)

1007
01:10:36.064 --> 01:10:38.066
You didn't let me finish.

1008
01:10:38.358 --> 01:10:40.694
I could double in
with Crawford or Hudson.


1009
01:10:40.986 --> 01:10:43.781
Crawford and Hudson are
staying with two other fellows.


1010
01:10:44.072 --> 01:10:48.243
You can't let her stay where
she is. Well, obviously not.


1011
01:10:48.535 --> 01:10:51.205
I've got it. You can say
she's married to Hudson.


1012
01:10:52.456 --> 01:10:54.249
Hudson?

1013
01:10:54.541 --> 01:10:56.770
Say, that's an idea. You know, if
she was married to an American citizen


1014
01:10:56.794 --> 01:10:58.754
she could get into the
states without any trouble.


1015
01:11:06.887 --> 01:11:10.432
You wish to see me, sir?
Yes, Hudson. Sit down.


1016
01:11:10.724 --> 01:11:11.724
Thank you, sir.

1017
01:11:13.894 --> 01:11:16.980
Would you like a drink?
Uh, no, thank you, sir.


1018
01:11:17.272 --> 01:11:19.817
Uh, Hudson, you are an
American citizen, aren't you?


1019
01:11:20.108 --> 01:11:22.611
I've been an American
citizen for the past 16 years, sir.


1020
01:11:22.903 --> 01:11:27.616
Good. I want you to
do me a favor. Yes, sir.


1021
01:11:27.908 --> 01:11:32.371
You remember that extremely attractive
lady that I was dancing with last night?


1022
01:11:32.663 --> 01:11:33.872
I do, sir.

1023
01:11:34.164 --> 01:11:35.582
Well, I want you to marry her.

1024
01:11:37.584 --> 01:11:40.420
Marry who, sir?
The lady I just mentioned.


1025
01:11:40.712 --> 01:11:42.089
It'll only be a temporary affair

1026
01:11:42.381 --> 01:11:44.258
and then aftennards,
you can get a divorce.


1027
01:11:44.550 --> 01:11:47.261
If I may say so, sir,
this is rather sudden.


1028
01:11:49.388 --> 01:11:52.599
I think I will take
a Brandy after all, sir.


1029
01:11:52.891 --> 01:11:56.103
I agree it's somewhat
extemporaneous,


1030
01:11:56.395 --> 01:11:57.980
but it's a matter of urgency.

1031
01:11:58.272 --> 01:12:00.208
You see, if the lady is
married to an American citizen


1032
01:12:00.232 --> 01:12:02.513
she'll have little trouble
getting into the United States.


1033
01:12:03.902 --> 01:12:05.737
And when does
all this happen, sir?


1034
01:12:06.029 --> 01:12:07.322
Oh, in about 10 minutes.

1035
01:12:09.700 --> 01:12:13.328
I still have to speak to the lady,
of course. She doesn't know yet?


1036
01:12:13.620 --> 01:12:16.999
Oh, no, not yet. But, uh, don't
worry. We're arranging that.


1037
01:12:17.291 --> 01:12:18.971
I think you should
be married before lunch.


1038
01:12:21.003 --> 01:12:23.046
Uh, you will have a Brandy?

1039
01:12:23.338 --> 01:12:24.778
Make it a double,
if you please, sir.


1040
01:12:25.007 --> 01:12:27.217
Double Brandy, please.
I'll have the same.


1041
01:12:27.509 --> 01:12:28.802
Yes, sir. Thank you.

1042
01:12:32.222 --> 01:12:35.392
If I might ask a rather
connubial question, sir,


1043
01:12:35.684 --> 01:12:39.521
what happens this evening,
that is, tonight?


1044
01:12:39.813 --> 01:12:41.815
After the marriage.

1045
01:12:42.107 --> 01:12:44.067
Oh, nothing that
concerns you, Hudson.


1046
01:12:44.359 --> 01:12:45.753
You'll be sleeping
in the same room,


1047
01:12:45.777 --> 01:12:47.154
but in different beds,
of course.


1048
01:12:50.574 --> 01:12:53.702
I think you should be
getting yourself ready.


1049
01:12:53.994 --> 01:12:57.289
Uh, I think you can wear an
ordinary lounge suit for the wedding.


1050
01:12:57.581 --> 01:12:59.541
Yes, sir. Fine.

1051
01:12:59.833 --> 01:13:03.712
And, uh, while you're getting
dressed, I'll talk to the lady.


1052
01:13:04.755 --> 01:13:05.756
Thank you.

1053
01:13:07.424 --> 01:13:09.718
(Knocking seven times in rhythm)

1054
01:13:14.932 --> 01:13:18.185
What's this I hear?
I'm to marry Hudson?


1055
01:13:18.477 --> 01:13:21.063
Well, it's an emergency.
Yes, but Hudson!


1056
01:13:21.355 --> 01:13:23.035
Well, I think it'll solve
all our problems.


1057
01:13:23.106 --> 01:13:24.706
You'll be married
to an American citizen.


1058
01:13:24.816 --> 01:13:26.753
You'll have little or no
trouble getting into the states


1059
01:13:26.777 --> 01:13:29.237
and, uh, aftennards
you can get a divorce.


1060
01:13:29.529 --> 01:13:33.033
But I've got nothing to wear. I mean,
I can't get married in your pajamas.


1061
01:13:33.325 --> 01:13:36.662
(Knocking on door) Harvey!

1062
01:13:36.954 --> 01:13:39.182
Well, it's all arranged. Captain'll
be down in a couple minutes.


1063
01:13:39.206 --> 01:13:40.582
What did you tell him?

1064
01:13:40.874 --> 01:13:42.936
I gave him a line about how
her papers blew overboard.


1065
01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:45.462
She met Hudson, they fell in
love. Well, the captain's on.


1066
01:13:45.754 --> 01:13:48.924
He pretty well understands the
situation, but it's gonna cost you dough.


1067
01:13:49.216 --> 01:13:50.336
Well, how's the happy bride?

1068
01:13:50.509 --> 01:13:52.678
Oh, I wish I were back
in Hong Kong.


1069
01:13:52.970 --> 01:13:53.970
(Doorbell buzzing)

1070
01:13:56.223 --> 01:13:57.391
That's the captain.

1071
01:14:01.353 --> 01:14:03.563
How do you do, sir?
How do you do?


1072
01:14:03.855 --> 01:14:07.317
Captain, you understand this
is to be kept strictly confidential.


1073
01:14:07.609 --> 01:14:09.152
I quite understand, Mr. Mears.

1074
01:14:09.444 --> 01:14:10.844
Mr. Harvey
has explained everything.


1075
01:14:11.071 --> 01:14:14.199
Good. And I assure you it
will be deeply appreciated.


1076
01:14:14.491 --> 01:14:16.868
We're only too pleased
to help out in such matters.


1077
01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:18.996
(Doorbell buzzing)

1078
01:14:19.287 --> 01:14:20.998
Who is it? Hudson, sir.

1079
01:14:24.167 --> 01:14:25.669
Hudson, you're late.
I'm sorry, sir.


1080
01:14:25.961 --> 01:14:29.089
Captain, I'd like to present
Hudson, the, uh, bridegroom.


1081
01:14:29.381 --> 01:14:32.592
How do you do? Now,
uh, where's the bride?


1082
01:14:32.884 --> 01:14:35.137
Oh, I believe
she's still dressing.


1083
01:14:36.179 --> 01:14:37.179
Are you ready?

1084
01:14:39.683 --> 01:14:43.979
Oh, the captain. It's all
too big. Nothing fits! Look!


1085
01:14:44.271 --> 01:14:46.271
You're losing weight.
You've been dieting too much.


1086
01:14:46.815 --> 01:14:48.775
Well, let's get on with it.

1087
01:14:49.067 --> 01:14:52.362
Countess, bridegroom.

1088
01:14:52.654 --> 01:14:55.323
Mr. Harvey, you're the best
man. Mr. Ogden, the witness.


1089
01:14:55.615 --> 01:14:56.855
We'll fill out the forms later.

1090
01:14:57.701 --> 01:14:59.369
Now then, um...

1091
01:14:59.661 --> 01:15:02.622
Do you, uh, Henry
lewisham Arthur Hudson


1092
01:15:02.914 --> 01:15:05.459
take this woman to be
your lawful wedded wife


1093
01:15:05.751 --> 01:15:07.419
till death do you part?

1094
01:15:08.086 --> 01:15:09.463
Oh! Oh!

1095
01:15:10.756 --> 01:15:12.424
Ogden: Well,
he's just over-excited.


1096
01:15:12.716 --> 01:15:13.716
Water!

1097
01:15:19.639 --> 01:15:21.683
Hudson, whatever made you faint?

1098
01:15:21.975 --> 01:15:25.353
I'm sorry, sir. I suppose it was the
excitement of those drastic words.


1099
01:15:25.645 --> 01:15:28.398
Drastic?
"Till death do us part."


1100
01:15:28.690 --> 01:15:30.776
That's no reflection on you,
madam, of course.


1101
01:15:31.068 --> 01:15:32.235
Now what's going to happen?

1102
01:15:32.527 --> 01:15:34.571
Well, that's what
I would like to know.


1103
01:15:34.863 --> 01:15:37.532
Nothing's going to happen.
You'll retire as usual.


1104
01:15:37.824 --> 01:15:39.201
Hudson will sleep
in the same room,


1105
01:15:39.493 --> 01:15:40.952
but in the other bed of course.

1106
01:15:41.244 --> 01:15:44.289
I hope so. The other bed.
The one near the door.


1107
01:15:46.166 --> 01:15:47.876
Just not to obfuscate matters.

1108
01:15:49.795 --> 01:15:52.547
Listen, this marriage
is just a formality.


1109
01:15:52.839 --> 01:15:55.008
The moment we get ashore,
I want a divorce.


1110
01:15:55.300 --> 01:15:58.053
Madam, whatever your desire is.

1111
01:15:58.345 --> 01:16:02.099
I am always at your service.
(Natascha scoffs)


1112
01:16:02.390 --> 01:16:05.060
Hudson, don't let the
champagne go to your head.


1113
01:16:05.352 --> 01:16:08.396
Better go to bed. Very well,
sir. Good night, Mr. Ogden.


1114
01:16:08.688 --> 01:16:10.649
Good night.
Good night, Mr. Harvey.


1115
01:16:10.941 --> 01:16:14.027
Madam, I presume
I'll see you later.


1116
01:16:17.531 --> 01:16:21.034
Ogden: Where are you going,
Hudson? There's the bedroom.


1117
01:16:27.415 --> 01:16:29.918
The whole thing
is an awful mess.


1118
01:16:30.210 --> 01:16:32.045
Well, this is Harvey's idea.

1119
01:16:32.337 --> 01:16:34.172
Why can't I sleep on the sofa?

1120
01:16:34.464 --> 01:16:37.759
Natascha, let's not go into all
that again. Where do you sleep?


1121
01:16:38.051 --> 01:16:40.679
I have to sit up and explain
the situation to Martha.


1122
01:16:40.971 --> 01:16:43.366
Well, why don't you have the captain
explain? (Car horn honking)


1123
01:16:43.390 --> 01:16:45.433
He's gone ashore.

1124
01:16:45.725 --> 01:16:48.685
If Martha finds you here without an
explanation, it's gonna create scandal.


1125
01:16:48.895 --> 01:16:51.815
I hate to interrupt. But I think
Martha just drove up in a Cadillac.


1126
01:16:52.107 --> 01:16:55.652
Natascha, please, please go
to bed! How can I with that man?


1127
01:16:55.944 --> 01:16:57.571
(Doorbell buzzing)
(Natascha gasps)


1128
01:16:59.114 --> 01:17:00.114
(Gasps)

1129
01:17:05.662 --> 01:17:07.080
There's no lock on this door.

1130
01:17:11.168 --> 01:17:14.963
That man is crazy. Oh,
natascha, please go to bed.


1131
01:17:15.255 --> 01:17:18.175
To think of having to do all
this to get a passport. Huh!


1132
01:17:26.975 --> 01:17:28.727
Ice water, sir. Oh.

1133
01:17:30.395 --> 01:17:32.898
I'll check to see if
Martha's arrived yet. Okay.


1134
01:17:38.945 --> 01:17:41.031
(Hudson gargling loudly)

1135
01:18:01.426 --> 01:18:02.426
Good night.

1136
01:18:12.020 --> 01:18:13.855
Oh!

1137
01:18:14.147 --> 01:18:16.274
In the excitement,
I forgot to brush my teeth.


1138
01:18:17.484 --> 01:18:18.693
(Brushing teeth)

1139
01:18:18.985 --> 01:18:19.985
(Hudson spits)

1140
01:18:50.517 --> 01:18:51.517
Boo!

1141
01:19:27.721 --> 01:19:28.721
Good night.

1142
01:20:03.256 --> 01:20:04.256
Ah!

1143
01:20:13.016 --> 01:20:14.016
(Door opens)

1144
01:20:35.455 --> 01:20:38.708
Hudson, find me some pajamas.

1145
01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:42.670
Oh, you've got mine on. Well,
find me something to sleep in.


1146
01:20:42.962 --> 01:20:46.508
Hasn't she arrived yet? No,
not yet. Expected momentarily.


1147
01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:49.928
I'm so nervous.
Natascha, don't worry.


1148
01:20:50.220 --> 01:20:51.930
Please, don't worry.

1149
01:20:52.222 --> 01:20:54.503
Everything will work out the
minute we can get you ashore.


1150
01:20:54.682 --> 01:20:58.603
Do you require a valise,
sir? Uh, no, I'll take them.


1151
01:20:58.895 --> 01:20:59.895
Thank you.

1152
01:21:02.065 --> 01:21:03.316
Now, trust me.

1153
01:21:08.530 --> 01:21:10.240
Good night, Hudson.
Good night, sir.


1154
01:21:16.871 --> 01:21:17.871
Harvey: Harvey.

1155
01:21:20.917 --> 01:21:24.129
I just heard from Martha. She won't
be coming aboard till 12:00 tomorrow.


1156
01:21:29.008 --> 01:21:30.385
(Clears throat)
Good night, harv.


1157
01:21:32.595 --> 01:21:34.180
Hudson... (Gasps)

1158
01:21:34.472 --> 01:21:36.200
In the other room. I'm
sleeping here tonight. Oh.


1159
01:21:36.224 --> 01:21:37.224
Yes, sir.

1160
01:21:39.769 --> 01:21:41.438
Good night, sir. Good night.

1161
01:21:47.402 --> 01:21:49.529
Oh! Oh.

1162
01:21:55.994 --> 01:21:57.579
May I come in? (Gasps)

1163
01:21:57.871 --> 01:21:59.581
Excuse me. My medicine.

1164
01:22:39.871 --> 01:22:42.332
(Doorbell buzzing)
Steward: Mr. Hudson?


1165
01:22:49.923 --> 01:22:50.923
(Grunts)

1166
01:23:00.183 --> 01:23:02.477
(Doorbell buzzing)
Mr. Hudson, your tea, sir.


1167
01:23:02.769 --> 01:23:04.604
Oh! Wait a moment! Oh!

1168
01:23:10.360 --> 01:23:12.320
Good morning, sir.
Congratulations.


1169
01:23:12.612 --> 01:23:13.612
Huh.

1170
01:23:18.034 --> 01:23:19.786
Good morning, madam. Your tea.

1171
01:23:20.495 --> 01:23:21.496
Mmm.

1172
01:23:24.582 --> 01:23:26.918
Would you like to order
breakfast, sir? Hmm?


1173
01:23:28.086 --> 01:23:30.421
Oh.

1174
01:23:30.713 --> 01:23:35.510
I think I'll have the oatmeal
porridge, the English pork sausages...


1175
01:23:35.802 --> 01:23:39.097
Oh, pardon me, madam. What
would you like for breakfast?


1176
01:23:39.389 --> 01:23:41.641
Eggs and bacon,
toast and coffee.


1177
01:23:41.933 --> 01:23:43.351
Eggs and bacon,
toast and coffee.


1178
01:23:55.196 --> 01:23:56.489
(Horns honking)

1179
01:24:00.118 --> 01:24:02.346
I hate to disturb you, Mr. Ogden,
but there's a little trouble


1180
01:24:02.370 --> 01:24:04.530
about Mrs. Hudson's papers
having been blown overboard.


1181
01:24:04.706 --> 01:24:06.026
They say the marriage
is not legal


1182
01:24:06.291 --> 01:24:08.091
unless she produces
her identification papers.


1183
01:24:08.167 --> 01:24:09.961
Well, what do they expect
the lady to do,


1184
01:24:10.253 --> 01:24:12.755
jump in the middle of the pacific
ocean and recover her papers?


1185
01:24:13.047 --> 01:24:14.087
They were blown overboard.

1186
01:24:14.257 --> 01:24:15.758
Unfortunately, there's a report

1187
01:24:16.050 --> 01:24:17.510
that a lady stowaway is aboard,

1188
01:24:17.802 --> 01:24:19.602
and of course they're
taking every precaution.


1189
01:24:19.887 --> 01:24:21.598
Well, what's a stowaway
got to do with it?


1190
01:24:21.889 --> 01:24:23.516
All that's involved here
is a marriage.


1191
01:24:23.808 --> 01:24:25.852
You were witness to that,
and you married them.


1192
01:24:26.144 --> 01:24:28.144
Nevertheless, they want
to see the lady's passport.


1193
01:24:28.354 --> 01:24:31.190
Passport? She doesn't need a
passport to go ashore in Honolulu.


1194
01:24:31.482 --> 01:24:33.484
She's married
to an American citizen.


1195
01:24:33.776 --> 01:24:36.529
Quite so. But if her papers
of identification are missing


1196
01:24:36.821 --> 01:24:39.032
then a marriage at sea
is not recognized.


1197
01:24:39.324 --> 01:24:42.368
She's an alien and will have to go
before an immigration board of inquiry.


1198
01:24:42.660 --> 01:24:44.746
(Doorbell buzzing)

1199
01:24:45.038 --> 01:24:46.456
The purser's asked
to see you, sir.


1200
01:24:46.748 --> 01:24:48.708
Yes, of course.
I'll see him right away.


1201
01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:50.640
If you'll excuse me,
ladies and gentlemen.


1202
01:24:56.049 --> 01:24:58.259
It's time for me to disappear.

1203
01:24:58.551 --> 01:25:02.055
Why? The captain married
you and that's a legal fact.


1204
01:25:02.347 --> 01:25:04.599
But the marriage has not yet
been consummated, sir.


1205
01:25:04.891 --> 01:25:07.143
Yet? (Scoffs)

1206
01:25:07.435 --> 01:25:10.271
Hudson, your mind is
running in another channel.


1207
01:25:10.563 --> 01:25:13.066
Now, the important thing
is the papers.


1208
01:25:13.358 --> 01:25:15.234
What are you gonna tell them
about the papers?


1209
01:25:15.526 --> 01:25:17.987
Mr. Ogden didn't tell me
anything about papers, sir.


1210
01:25:18.279 --> 01:25:22.283
Her identification papers, her
birth certificate, her passport!


1211
01:25:22.575 --> 01:25:23.719
We've been
all through that with you.


1212
01:25:23.743 --> 01:25:25.370
Now, what are you
gonna tell them?


1213
01:25:25.662 --> 01:25:28.081
Oh, that. I shall tell them
the truth, as you told me.


1214
01:25:28.373 --> 01:25:29.457
As I told you?

1215
01:25:29.749 --> 01:25:31.793
No, sir. As you told me
to tell it.


1216
01:25:32.085 --> 01:25:34.671
Look, I didn't tell you anything.
Now, you remember that.


1217
01:25:34.962 --> 01:25:36.923
Yes, sir. Now, go ahead.

1218
01:25:37.215 --> 01:25:40.051
Well, I can only tell them
how I met my first wife.


1219
01:25:40.343 --> 01:25:42.595
How you first met your wife. Oh!

1220
01:25:42.887 --> 01:25:44.639
Well, it was a breezy afternoon.

1221
01:25:44.931 --> 01:25:46.557
I was walking on the top deck,

1222
01:25:46.849 --> 01:25:50.144
and there she was, holding
down some papers in her lap,


1223
01:25:50.436 --> 01:25:51.938
it was love at first sight.

1224
01:25:52.230 --> 01:25:53.731
Ugh!

1225
01:25:54.023 --> 01:25:56.776
Hurry up and get to the
point, Hudson. Yes, sir.


1226
01:25:57.068 --> 01:26:01.656
Suddenly, there was a gust of
wind, and the papers blew overboard.


1227
01:26:01.948 --> 01:26:04.158
Hudson, you have
literary talent.


1228
01:26:04.450 --> 01:26:05.743
(Doorbell buzzing)

1229
01:26:10.081 --> 01:26:11.374
I think we better go,
Mr. Hudson.


1230
01:26:11.666 --> 01:26:13.146
The immigration officials
are waiting.


1231
01:26:16.838 --> 01:26:18.297
No, now wait just one moment.

1232
01:26:18.589 --> 01:26:19.869
I think I should go with Hudson.

1233
01:26:20.049 --> 01:26:21.300
An excellent idea, Mr. Mears.

1234
01:26:21.592 --> 01:26:22.912
Your presence
will be efficacious.


1235
01:26:23.052 --> 01:26:24.721
Would you like me
to go along, too?


1236
01:26:25.012 --> 01:26:27.212
No, no, I want you to stay
here and look after natascha.


1237
01:26:29.100 --> 01:26:30.184
Don't worry.

1238
01:26:31.769 --> 01:26:33.688
Mr. Mears, I think we better go.

1239
01:26:36.107 --> 01:26:37.150
Come along, Hudson.

1240
01:26:40.278 --> 01:26:41.779
(Door closes)

1241
01:26:42.071 --> 01:26:44.907
Harvey, you remember what
I told you about Honolulu?


1242
01:26:45.199 --> 01:26:47.368
You're not going to dive
off the boat? Now is the time.


1243
01:26:47.660 --> 01:26:48.940
While they're
questioning Hudson.


1244
01:26:50.663 --> 01:26:52.248
(Chattering indistinctly)

1245
01:27:06.262 --> 01:27:07.847
(Crowd gasping)

1246
01:27:16.481 --> 01:27:18.649
Hey, I'll see you
on the beach at waikiki.


1247
01:27:18.941 --> 01:27:20.526
Mmm-hmm.

1248
01:27:20.818 --> 01:27:23.172
If I'm far off, you'll jump up
and down, then I'll recognize you.


1249
01:27:23.196 --> 01:27:24.405
Mmm.

1250
01:27:24.697 --> 01:27:26.699
So if I make it,
I'll see you later.


1251
01:27:28.618 --> 01:27:31.329
Man: Hmm. Here's another
one. (Crowd murmuring)


1252
01:27:36.501 --> 01:27:37.543
If you make it?

1253
01:27:38.461 --> 01:27:39.587
Wait a minute!

1254
01:27:39.879 --> 01:27:41.064
What do you mean,
if you make it?


1255
01:27:41.088 --> 01:27:42.799
I'm scared. What?

1256
01:27:43.090 --> 01:27:44.090
And here goes.

1257
01:27:46.552 --> 01:27:48.179
(Crowd cheering)

1258
01:27:50.264 --> 01:27:51.264
(Applauding)

1259
01:27:54.060 --> 01:27:56.854
What's going on out there? That's
a Hawaiian diving off the boat.


1260
01:28:00.024 --> 01:28:03.653
Now, Mr. Hudson, we'd
like to see your wife.


1261
01:28:03.945 --> 01:28:05.571
I believe she's taking
a bath, sir.


1262
01:28:16.207 --> 01:28:18.000
Oh, my. How nice.

1263
01:28:20.461 --> 01:28:21.629
Maria? Oui?

1264
01:28:21.921 --> 01:28:23.589
(Speaking French)

1265
01:28:23.881 --> 01:28:28.261
(Speaking French)

1266
01:28:28.553 --> 01:28:31.222
(Both speaking French)

1267
01:28:33.349 --> 01:28:37.061
Ah, Martha! Hello, Harvey.

1268
01:28:37.353 --> 01:28:39.814
Oh, what comfortable
quarters you have. Oh, yes.


1269
01:28:40.106 --> 01:28:42.859
Lovely. Where's ogden?

1270
01:28:43.150 --> 01:28:45.778
Uh, he's up in the lounge
with Hudson.


1271
01:28:46.070 --> 01:28:48.364
Of course, you know,
Hudson's married now.


1272
01:28:48.656 --> 01:28:51.450
Hudson married?
Oh, really? That's odd.


1273
01:28:51.742 --> 01:28:55.037
Yes. Ah, well,
the captain married them.


1274
01:28:55.329 --> 01:28:56.539
Can I get you something?

1275
01:28:56.831 --> 01:28:58.541
No, it's much too early.
(Doorbell buzzing)


1276
01:29:01.252 --> 01:29:03.796
Captain, this is
Mrs. Ogden mears.


1277
01:29:04.088 --> 01:29:07.675
How do you do? Pardon me.
How do you do?


1278
01:29:07.967 --> 01:29:10.367
We're still waiting for Mrs.
Hudson. Oh, she's taking a bath.


1279
01:29:10.595 --> 01:29:12.595
Uh, she should be finished
by now. I'll go and see.


1280
01:29:16.434 --> 01:29:17.476
Well.

1281
01:29:23.149 --> 01:29:25.276
Can I get you something,
captain?


1282
01:29:25.568 --> 01:29:27.328
No, thanks. But if you
don't mind my waiting.


1283
01:29:27.570 --> 01:29:28.570
It's quite all right.

1284
01:29:28.654 --> 01:29:29.739
(Exhales)

1285
01:29:40.124 --> 01:29:42.209
Hello, Martha. Hello, ogden.

1286
01:29:42.501 --> 01:29:43.502
(Chuckles)

1287
01:29:45.338 --> 01:29:47.757
Well, you've met the captain.

1288
01:29:48.049 --> 01:29:50.468
Yes, of course. We're
looking for Mrs. Hudson.


1289
01:29:50.760 --> 01:29:52.654
You see, the immigration
officers are out in the lounge


1290
01:29:52.678 --> 01:29:54.158
and I don't like
to keep them waiting.


1291
01:29:54.221 --> 01:29:56.307
She's not in the bathroom.
I looked all over.


1292
01:29:56.599 --> 01:29:58.017
Well, it's very serious.

1293
01:29:58.309 --> 01:30:00.078
It means that without her
identification papers,


1294
01:30:00.102 --> 01:30:01.354
she can't land anywhere.

1295
01:30:01.646 --> 01:30:02.980
She doesn't exist.

1296
01:30:03.272 --> 01:30:05.232
Well, if she doesn't exist,
there's no problem.


1297
01:30:06.651 --> 01:30:08.361
Well, I think we should
look for her.


1298
01:30:08.653 --> 01:30:09.654
It might be a good idea

1299
01:30:09.946 --> 01:30:11.214
if you had another look
at the bathroom.


1300
01:30:11.238 --> 01:30:12.657
(Chuckles nervously)

1301
01:30:12.949 --> 01:30:15.159
Martha, would you
excuse us for a moment?


1302
01:30:15.451 --> 01:30:16.661
All right, captain.

1303
01:30:24.293 --> 01:30:25.294
Hey!

1304
01:30:28.923 --> 01:30:31.008
Waikiki? Driver:
Hop in the back, sister.


1305
01:30:31.300 --> 01:30:32.343
Thank you!

1306
01:30:46.565 --> 01:30:50.111
Whew! That's the strangest
thing I've ever known.


1307
01:30:50.403 --> 01:30:51.403
She's disappeared.

1308
01:30:57.076 --> 01:30:58.916
Well, I think we better
search the entire boat.


1309
01:30:59.161 --> 01:31:00.871
(Ship horn blowing)

1310
01:31:07.586 --> 01:31:09.547
Good morning, madam.

1311
01:31:09.839 --> 01:31:12.341
Congratulations, Hudson.
I hear you're married now.


1312
01:31:12.633 --> 01:31:14.719
Well, in a way, yes.

1313
01:31:15.011 --> 01:31:16.971
Hudson, what do you mean?

1314
01:31:17.263 --> 01:31:19.056
The marriage has not yet
been consummated.


1315
01:31:20.850 --> 01:31:22.143
What is she, an American?

1316
01:31:22.435 --> 01:31:24.395
No, madam,
she is from Hong Kong.


1317
01:31:24.687 --> 01:31:27.314
Chinese?
I shouldn't think so, madam,


1318
01:31:27.606 --> 01:31:29.942
I believe she is
a Russian emigre.


1319
01:31:30.234 --> 01:31:32.862
Well, I should like to meet her.

1320
01:31:33.154 --> 01:31:34.321
I'll do my best, madam.

1321
01:31:35.698 --> 01:31:36.741
(Chuckles) Well.

1322
01:31:38.784 --> 01:31:41.328
Well, Hudson, it seems as
though your wife has disappeared.


1323
01:31:41.620 --> 01:31:44.290
Oh, that's awful. Poor Hudson.

1324
01:31:44.582 --> 01:31:46.751
I was beginning to grow
very fond of her.


1325
01:31:47.043 --> 01:31:48.563
Hudson, what have you
done to the lady?


1326
01:31:48.836 --> 01:31:52.089
Oh, nothing, madam. The
marriage was never consummated.


1327
01:31:52.381 --> 01:31:54.181
Hudson, you've got
"consummated" on the brain.


1328
01:31:56.218 --> 01:31:58.345
Well, I think I'll go ashore
and do some shopping.


1329
01:31:58.637 --> 01:32:00.848
I think I'll go
with you, Harvey.


1330
01:32:01.140 --> 01:32:03.260
Oh, don't go yet, ogden.
I've just ordered some lunch,


1331
01:32:03.476 --> 01:32:05.796
and there's one or two things
I'd like to discuss with you.


1332
01:32:05.895 --> 01:32:07.815
Very well, I'll stay and
have something with you.


1333
01:32:07.855 --> 01:32:09.857
What has madam ordered?
A consummated soup, sir.


1334
01:32:10.149 --> 01:32:13.486
What's that?
(Stammering) Consomme, sir.


1335
01:32:13.778 --> 01:32:15.946
Cold chicken, asparagus
and a bottle of chablis.


1336
01:32:16.238 --> 01:32:18.532
All right, I'll have the
same. I'll see you both later.


1337
01:32:18.824 --> 01:32:20.826
At the waikiki hotel,

1338
01:32:22.244 --> 01:32:23.704
uh, you may go, Hudson.

1339
01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:29.418
Did you hear from Washington?

1340
01:32:29.710 --> 01:32:31.629
I, uh, got this letter
this morning.


1341
01:32:32.880 --> 01:32:34.160
Well, here's the substance of it

1342
01:32:34.423 --> 01:32:35.966
"to allay rumors of divorce,

1343
01:32:36.258 --> 01:32:38.612
"I think Martha and you should
return to the states together.


1344
01:32:38.636 --> 01:32:42.598
"I advise this because of my great
affection for you both." Etc, etc, etc.


1345
01:32:44.308 --> 01:32:45.309
So...

1346
01:32:46.936 --> 01:32:49.730
Well, if this arrangement
doesn't work out


1347
01:32:50.022 --> 01:32:51.622
how will it affect
my divorce settlement?


1348
01:32:52.983 --> 01:32:55.236
You can put that in escrow.

1349
01:32:55.528 --> 01:32:59.281
Unfortunately, ogden, the only interest
I have is money, having had no children.


1350
01:32:59.573 --> 01:33:02.326
Am I to blame for that? No.

1351
01:33:02.618 --> 01:33:04.745
No, neither one of us
is to blame.


1352
01:33:05.037 --> 01:33:07.123
The desire for happiness
fooled us both.


1353
01:33:08.374 --> 01:33:09.583
Happiness, eh?

1354
01:33:11.043 --> 01:33:14.130
I was going to say "love,"

1355
01:33:14.421 --> 01:33:17.633
but I don't think either one of
us knows what the word means.


1356
01:33:17.925 --> 01:33:20.206
Well, in any case, what are
you gonna do about Washington?


1357
01:33:21.595 --> 01:33:23.931
Well...

1358
01:33:24.223 --> 01:33:27.143
I don't look foward to spending
the rest of my life in Saudi Arabia.


1359
01:33:33.357 --> 01:33:35.818
Listen, she has long dark hair,

1360
01:33:36.110 --> 01:33:38.988
wears a sarong and looks
very much like a Hawaiian.


1361
01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:41.991
There's a lot of dames
look like that around here.


1362
01:33:42.283 --> 01:33:44.702
But she said she'd meet me
on the beach at waikiki.


1363
01:33:44.994 --> 01:33:48.747
(Chuckles) I think
she's kidding you. Maybe.


1364
01:33:49.039 --> 01:33:50.499
Where's the beach at waikiki?

1365
01:33:50.791 --> 01:33:52.835
Well, that's the waikiki hotel.

1366
01:34:12.062 --> 01:34:14.022
Can I check this suitcase,
please? Certainly, sir.


1367
01:34:14.273 --> 01:34:15.482
(Bell ringing) What name?

1368
01:34:15.774 --> 01:34:17.151
Uh, Harvey crothers.

1369
01:34:17.443 --> 01:34:19.737
Check Mr. Crothers' case
into the cloakroom.


1370
01:34:20.029 --> 01:34:21.947
Is the waikiki beach near here?

1371
01:34:22.239 --> 01:34:23.532
It's just outside, sir.

1372
01:34:24.617 --> 01:34:25.659
That's strange.

1373
01:34:44.637 --> 01:34:46.680
I can't stop! Oh.

1374
01:34:46.972 --> 01:34:49.725
Oh! All this jumping up and
down is like running 10 miles.


1375
01:34:50.017 --> 01:34:52.895
Harvey, it's so good
to see you again.


1376
01:34:53.187 --> 01:34:54.605
Let's sit down. (Panting)

1377
01:34:54.897 --> 01:34:56.023
(Both exhale)

1378
01:34:59.568 --> 01:35:00.848
I didn't think I'd see you again

1379
01:35:00.945 --> 01:35:02.214
after that dive. 
It was perfect.

1380
01:35:02.238 --> 01:35:03.572
What's happening on the boat?

1381
01:35:03.864 --> 01:35:05.744
Oh, they're still waiting
for you in the lounge.


1382
01:35:05.824 --> 01:35:07.826
And ogden? He's with his wife.

1383
01:35:10.246 --> 01:35:11.580
Yes.

1384
01:35:11.872 --> 01:35:13.475
On the way down,
I bought you some clothes.


1385
01:35:13.499 --> 01:35:15.019
Oh, I know the other ones
were too big.


1386
01:35:15.084 --> 01:35:16.710
These are smaller.

1387
01:35:17.002 --> 01:35:19.064
There's a place you can
change right next to the pool.


1388
01:35:19.088 --> 01:35:20.848
Meanwhile, I'll book you
a room at the hotel.


1389
01:35:20.965 --> 01:35:23.801
They might be looking for
Mrs. Hudson. Not a chance.


1390
01:35:24.093 --> 01:35:25.261
I'll book them under my name.

1391
01:35:25.552 --> 01:35:27.930
For the time being,
you're Mrs. Harvey crothers.


1392
01:35:31.475 --> 01:35:33.394
Remember me? Mr. Crothers.
Yes, sir.


1393
01:35:33.686 --> 01:35:36.105
I'd like an outside suite.
Certainly, sir. For yourself?


1394
01:35:36.397 --> 01:35:39.525
No, for my wife. I'm leaving
for the mainland. Very well, sir.


1395
01:35:39.817 --> 01:35:41.097
Do you wish
to see the rooms now?


1396
01:35:41.151 --> 01:35:42.254
Oh, no, I'll wait for my wife.

1397
01:35:42.278 --> 01:35:45.489
Fine. Well, here she...

1398
01:35:45.781 --> 01:35:49.243
Well! It doesn't
fit. This is too tight.


1399
01:35:49.535 --> 01:35:50.535
(Breathes heavily)

1400
01:35:50.744 --> 01:35:54.248
I can't breathe. (Coughs)

1401
01:35:54.540 --> 01:35:56.000
You dropped your change.

1402
01:35:56.292 --> 01:35:58.573
(Clears throat) Will you
sign the register, Mrs. Crothers?


1403
01:36:01.213 --> 01:36:03.090
C—r—o... t-h...

1404
01:36:10.889 --> 01:36:12.474
She's not here.

1405
01:36:12.766 --> 01:36:14.810
Let's have some tea. Yeah.

1406
01:36:20.107 --> 01:36:21.608
Ah, there he is.

1407
01:36:23.819 --> 01:36:25.779
Harvey, I'm so sorry I'm late.

1408
01:36:26.071 --> 01:36:28.191
I had to leave ogden with
the immigration authorities.


1409
01:36:28.365 --> 01:36:30.285
It seems they're still
looking for Hudson's wife.


1410
01:36:30.326 --> 01:36:31.910
Ah, yes. (Suitcases thud)

1411
01:36:32.202 --> 01:36:33.829
There she is.

1412
01:36:34.121 --> 01:36:36.681
Oh, Hudson, you haven't been
drinking before lunch, have you now?


1413
01:36:36.749 --> 01:36:39.251
The poor man is so distressed
since his wife went away.


1414
01:36:39.543 --> 01:36:42.629
Do you know that's the third
person he's mistaken for his wife?


1415
01:36:42.921 --> 01:36:44.298
(Chuckles) Oh...
I beg your pardon.


1416
01:36:44.590 --> 01:36:46.675
Martha, this is my wife,
Mrs. Crothers.


1417
01:36:46.967 --> 01:36:49.386
Mrs. Ogden mears. 
How do you do?

1418
01:36:51.347 --> 01:36:52.514
How do you do?

1419
01:36:56.185 --> 01:36:57.811
(Clears throat)

1420
01:36:58.103 --> 01:36:59.730
You know,
Harvey is so secretive.


1421
01:37:00.022 --> 01:37:02.232
He never told me a word
about his marriage.


1422
01:37:02.524 --> 01:37:04.735
Oh, well,
there's not much to tell.


1423
01:37:05.027 --> 01:37:08.655
We haven't been
married long, have we?


1424
01:37:08.947 --> 01:37:11.116
But as soon as something
develops, we'll let you know.


1425
01:37:12.493 --> 01:37:14.620
No, I mean, when did you marry?

1426
01:37:14.912 --> 01:37:17.873
(Laughs) That's the secret.

1427
01:37:18.165 --> 01:37:23.379
Well, however, you must bring your wife to
Arabia once we've refurbished the embassy,


1428
01:37:23.670 --> 01:37:25.440
but not before, othennise
you'll have to sleep


1429
01:37:25.464 --> 01:37:26.664
in a tent like the rest of us.

1430
01:37:26.924 --> 01:37:29.760
A tent? Well,
that's rather romantic.


1431
01:37:30.052 --> 01:37:31.553
Thatdepends with
whom you share it.


1432
01:37:31.845 --> 01:37:33.347
(Orchestra playing) Hmm.

1433
01:37:33.639 --> 01:37:36.308
Martha, would you
like to dance? I'd love it.


1434
01:37:36.600 --> 01:37:39.269
It'll give me a chance to give
some advice to the lovelorn.


1435
01:37:53.575 --> 01:37:55.869
This is the first chance I've
had to speak to you alone.


1436
01:37:58.664 --> 01:38:02.918
There's very little time,
and I've a lot to tell you.


1437
01:38:03.210 --> 01:38:06.130
Harvey will be staying behind, so
I'll be in touch with you through him.


1438
01:38:06.422 --> 01:38:08.841
He'll be working
on a passport for you.


1439
01:38:09.133 --> 01:38:11.760
Martha's coming with me.
That's...


1440
01:38:12.052 --> 01:38:13.612
That's what I want
to talk to you about.


1441
01:38:16.348 --> 01:38:19.184
I got a letter from
Washington saying that Martha


1442
01:38:19.476 --> 01:38:20.811
should go
with me to Saudi Arabia


1443
01:38:21.103 --> 01:38:23.689
for appearances' sake.
Of course.


1444
01:38:26.108 --> 01:38:28.026
Please try to understand.

1445
01:38:28.902 --> 01:38:29.903
Of course.

1446
01:38:32.823 --> 01:38:35.409
For appearances' sake.

1447
01:38:35.701 --> 01:38:38.245
For the esteem of people
I don't give a damn about.


1448
01:38:40.289 --> 01:38:44.001
If I had the guts, I'd rid
myself of the whole thing:


1449
01:38:44.293 --> 01:38:47.296
Washington, Saudi Arabia
and everything.


1450
01:38:47.588 --> 01:38:48.755
You can't do that.

1451
01:39:03.312 --> 01:39:05.564
Be careful, we're being watched.

1452
01:39:06.982 --> 01:39:08.484
The legal eye is upon us.

1453
01:39:11.487 --> 01:39:13.007
But you must believe me
when I tell you


1454
01:39:13.197 --> 01:39:15.407
that this is the first
real happiness I've known.


1455
01:39:17.075 --> 01:39:18.410
I love you very much.

1456
01:39:20.996 --> 01:39:24.291
Your wife looks sad.
You think so?


1457
01:39:24.583 --> 01:39:27.628
What nonsense.
She's not your wife.


1458
01:39:27.920 --> 01:39:30.047
Martha, now you're being silly.

1459
01:39:30.339 --> 01:39:31.840
Not as silly as you think.

1460
01:39:32.132 --> 01:39:34.426
I've been talking to someone
who knew her in Hong Kong.


1461
01:39:36.678 --> 01:39:39.806
The boat passes here at 11:00.

1462
01:39:40.098 --> 01:39:43.310
I'll be on deck imagining that
you're sitting here at this table.


1463
01:39:44.603 --> 01:39:47.356
Let's dance. I can't.

1464
01:39:49.816 --> 01:39:53.320
I must go to my room
before your wife returns.


1465
01:39:53.612 --> 01:39:57.533
I can't say goodbye.
I can't trust myself.


1466
01:40:00.577 --> 01:40:02.037
Will you excuse me?

1467
01:40:09.127 --> 01:40:11.922
Well, goodbye. Harvey
will take care of everything.


1468
01:40:12.214 --> 01:40:13.423
All right. Thank you.

1469
01:40:23.642 --> 01:40:25.352
What's happened
to Mrs. Crothers?


1470
01:40:25.644 --> 01:40:26.924
Oh, she had a splitting headache

1471
01:40:27.062 --> 01:40:28.647
and asked to be excused, Martha.

1472
01:40:28.939 --> 01:40:31.358
She won't be seeing
us off? I don't think so.


1473
01:40:31.650 --> 01:40:33.360
She's going straight
to her room to bed.


1474
01:40:33.652 --> 01:40:35.652
Well, can't we just go up
and see her for a moment?


1475
01:40:35.737 --> 01:40:37.777
Well, I think it'll be best
to let her rest quietly.


1476
01:40:37.823 --> 01:40:40.367
Pardon me, madam, but
it's time to leave for the boat.


1477
01:40:40.659 --> 01:40:43.328
Oh, so soon? Well...

1478
01:40:51.503 --> 01:40:53.630
Hudson, I will need
these three closets


1479
01:40:53.922 --> 01:40:55.522
and Mr. Ogden mears
can have the end one.


1480
01:40:55.757 --> 01:40:56.883
Very well, madam.

1481
01:41:02.139 --> 01:41:04.600
Your big trunks I'm
having put in the hold, sir,


1482
01:41:04.891 --> 01:41:06.935
so there'll be more room
for madam's wardrobe.


1483
01:41:07.769 --> 01:41:08.937
Okay, Hudson.

1484
01:41:33.128 --> 01:41:34.212
Voila.

1485
01:41:39.384 --> 01:41:43.180
Hudson, have you found
your wife yet? Not yet, madam.


1486
01:41:43.472 --> 01:41:45.472
Well, surely you're not
going to leave without her.


1487
01:41:45.682 --> 01:41:47.225
Whatever happens, madam,

1488
01:41:47.517 --> 01:41:49.645
I shall deport myself as a
husband and a gentleman.


1489
01:41:51.855 --> 01:41:52.855
Maria.

1490
01:41:53.023 --> 01:41:54.023
Merci.

1491
01:41:55.651 --> 01:41:57.569
Oh! What's this?

1492
01:42:01.198 --> 01:42:04.034
Hudson, does this belong
to your wife?


1493
01:42:04.326 --> 01:42:05.994
Ihavent
the faintest idea, madam.


1494
01:42:06.286 --> 01:42:08.121
We haven't been married
that long.


1495
01:42:08.413 --> 01:42:11.291
(Chuckles) Oh!

1496
01:42:11.583 --> 01:42:14.336
Perhaps you might know
something about this, your excellency.


1497
01:42:17.255 --> 01:42:19.508
It looks like a two-ring circus.

1498
01:42:23.303 --> 01:42:27.849
Ogden, you must be losing
your sense of propriety.


1499
01:42:28.141 --> 01:42:30.435
You not only humiliate me
in front of people,


1500
01:42:30.727 --> 01:42:37.150
but you insult my intelligence by introducing
that woman as Mrs. Harvey crothers,


1501
01:42:37.442 --> 01:42:40.779
and then again as Mrs. Hudson
when she's sleeping here in your cabin.


1502
01:42:42.989 --> 01:42:44.700
As ambassador to Saudi Arabia,

1503
01:42:44.991 --> 01:42:46.493
it is not exactly comme il faut

1504
01:42:46.785 --> 01:42:50.288
to include in your entourage
the mistress of a gangster.


1505
01:42:50.580 --> 01:42:51.580
A prostitute.

1506
01:42:54.042 --> 01:42:57.879
I wonder what your fate would have been
if you'd been in similar circumstances.


1507
01:42:58.171 --> 01:43:01.800
(Ship horn blowing)
(Chattering indistinctly)


1508
01:43:02.092 --> 01:43:04.720
(Band playing auld lang syne)

1509
01:43:05.011 --> 01:43:06.263
(Cheering)

1510
01:43:42.174 --> 01:43:43.884
Hello.

1511
01:43:44.176 --> 01:43:46.428
Hello, Harvey? Ogden.
Ogden, haven't you left yet?


1512
01:43:46.720 --> 01:43:49.556
No, I got off with the pilot
boat. Well, what happened?


1513
01:43:49.848 --> 01:43:51.933
I don't know.
I just couldn't take it.


1514
01:43:52.225 --> 01:43:54.561
Aren't you going to Washington?
What about your career?


1515
01:43:54.853 --> 01:43:59.274
I'd rather be happy than president.
Listen, where is everybody?


1516
01:43:59.566 --> 01:44:04.404
You know who, your wife. Pardon
me, sir. I think you mean my wife.


1517
01:44:04.696 --> 01:44:06.823
Hudson's giving me
an argument here.


1518
01:44:07.115 --> 01:44:08.968
Tell him she came down
to the cabaret after you left


1519
01:44:08.992 --> 01:44:10.344
and she's been sitting
by the window,


1520
01:44:10.368 --> 01:44:11.787
looking out at the sea
ever since.


1521
01:44:12.078 --> 01:44:13.455
Did you tell her the news?
Oh, yes.


1522
01:44:13.747 --> 01:44:15.540
I told her there was
nothing to worry about.


1523
01:44:15.832 --> 01:44:17.602
The immigration people have
given her the benefit of the doubt.


1524
01:44:17.626 --> 01:44:20.462
She's now Hudson's wife,
married to an American citizen.


1525
01:44:20.754 --> 01:44:22.954
Listen, don't tell her I'm
here. I want to surprise her.


1526
01:44:31.556 --> 01:44:33.433
Ogden!

1527
01:44:33.725 --> 01:44:35.685
Well, buddy, I hope
you're doing the right thing.


1528
01:44:35.977 --> 01:44:37.145
Where is she?

1529
01:44:37.437 --> 01:44:38.873
Right where you left her,
sitting by the window.


1530
01:44:38.897 --> 01:44:41.817
Good, listen, I'll see
you in the morning.


1531
01:44:42.108 --> 01:44:44.152
(Tango music playing)

1532
01:44:48.824 --> 01:44:50.116
Yes, sir?

1533
01:44:50.408 --> 01:44:51.576
I'm looking for a young lady.

1534
01:44:51.868 --> 01:44:53.137
I believe she's sitting
alone by the window.


1535
01:44:53.161 --> 01:44:54.161
Yes, sir.

1536
01:45:19.646 --> 01:45:20.689
(Inaudible)

1537
01:45:25.777 --> 01:45:26.820
Ogden!

1538
01:45:28.363 --> 01:45:29.823
See, you can't get rid of me.

1539
01:45:31.533 --> 01:45:32.701
May I have this dance?
