1
00:00:41.843 --> 00:00:43.497
Yeah, as long as we have
the bid in by Thursday,


2
00:00:43.497 --> 00:00:47.283
we should be fine. I have a good
feeling about this one.


3
00:00:47.283 --> 00:00:49.938
Alright. You got it, George.
Thank you.


4
00:00:49.938 --> 00:00:51.287
Is that a close
on the Howard Ranch?


5
00:00:51.287 --> 00:00:53.420
Almost. Fingers crossed.

6
00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.596
Ah, impressive. You know...

7
00:00:55.596 --> 00:00:58.338
You're practically running
this company singlehandedly.


8
00:00:58.338 --> 00:00:59.904
If I'm running Livvana singlehandedly,

9
00:00:59.904 --> 00:01:01.166
what does that say about you?

10
00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:02.298
That I know how to benefit from

11
00:01:02.298 --> 00:01:04.256
my harder-working colleagues.

12
00:01:04.256 --> 00:01:06.433
You ready to go to this meeting,
Diana said that she wanted us


13
00:01:06.433 --> 00:01:09.349
there at 4 p.m. sharp.
Come on, we gotta go.


14
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.834
And here she is now!

15
00:01:21.665 --> 00:01:23.972
The youngest executive
in Livvana's history


16
00:01:23.972 --> 00:01:28.193
has just hit $100 million
in sales for the year.


17
00:01:28.193 --> 00:01:32.502
- Yeah!
- Congratulations, Leah.


18
00:01:32.502 --> 00:01:34.809
We're so proud to have you
as part of our family.


19
00:01:48.518 --> 00:01:50.607
Well...

20
00:01:50.607 --> 00:01:53.654
- That's right.
- Okay. Oh, thank you.


21
00:01:53.654 --> 00:01:55.786
Thank you so much. Thank you.

22
00:02:00.878 --> 00:02:02.576
Oh, don't pick up
your own party.


23
00:02:02.576 --> 00:02:04.229
That's what we have
a cleaning staff for.


24
00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.014
You know
I can't do that to them.


25
00:02:06.014 --> 00:02:08.277
I always like to leave a place
better than I found it.


26
00:02:10.453 --> 00:02:13.413
Thank you. You really
didn't have to do all this.


27
00:02:13.413 --> 00:02:15.893
We missed celebrating
the other milestones.


28
00:02:15.893 --> 00:02:18.505
I figured we couldn't let
this one pass us up, too.


29
00:02:18.505 --> 00:02:21.116
Especially not one this big.

30
00:02:23.553 --> 00:02:25.468
Mind if I have
a private word with Leah?


31
00:02:26.774 --> 00:02:28.819
- Oh, yeah, sure.
- Thanks.


32
00:02:40.135 --> 00:02:44.444
Oh, Leah, leave that. Uh,
please, come and have a seat.


33
00:02:44.444 --> 00:02:46.402
- I wanna have a chat.
- What's going on?


34
00:02:46.402 --> 00:02:47.447
Right.

35
00:02:50.406 --> 00:02:53.844
The board is very impressed
with you, you know?


36
00:02:53.844 --> 00:02:55.672
I'm so flattered. Thank you.

37
00:02:55.672 --> 00:02:58.501
It's not easy getting
where you are in this business.


38
00:02:58.501 --> 00:03:01.417
I-I won't pretend
it was easy for me either.


39
00:03:01.417 --> 00:03:05.639
Being a woman in what is still
very much a man's world,


40
00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:09.730
you often have to work twice
as hard to only get half as far.


41
00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.037
But it's worth it,
we're making a difference


42
00:03:13.037 --> 00:03:15.039
taking the archaic work
of the past


43
00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:17.172
and making it relevant
for the future.


44
00:03:17.172 --> 00:03:20.958
We make vacation homes
and resorts, Diana.


45
00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:25.093
We make futures
and we make money.


46
00:03:25.093 --> 00:03:27.182
I know you've got that little...

47
00:03:27.182 --> 00:03:30.925
Well, more than little nest egg
you've been saving for years.


48
00:03:32.622 --> 00:03:35.059
But I mean it,
the board loves you.


49
00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:37.801
I'd say all it takes is
one more impressive project,


50
00:03:37.801 --> 00:03:40.543
and I'm looking
at my future partner.


51
00:03:45.374 --> 00:03:48.986
Wow. Diana,
I don't know what to say.


52
00:03:48.986 --> 00:03:53.513
You don't have to say anything.
You deserve it.


53
00:03:53.513 --> 00:03:58.082
Just... don't mention anything
to Michael.


54
00:03:58.082 --> 00:03:59.954
I wanna believe
he'll be a good sport,


55
00:03:59.954 --> 00:04:03.218
but I'm not sure
how he'll take the news


56
00:04:03.218 --> 00:04:05.960
that I'm giving you
the promotion over him.


57
00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.144
- Huh. Hi, Michael.
- There she is!


58
00:04:16.144 --> 00:04:18.712
- How was your little chat?
- You know Diana.


59
00:04:18.712 --> 00:04:21.889
- She just likes to check in.
- With you, maybe.


60
00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:25.545
Don't you guys have always had
your own little thing going on?


61
00:04:25.545 --> 00:04:29.287
I think she just sees me
as similar to her.


62
00:04:29.287 --> 00:04:31.376
And honestly, she's kind of
the only mentor I've ever had.


63
00:04:31.376 --> 00:04:33.291
- Scoot up.
- Exactly.


64
00:04:33.291 --> 00:04:35.729
Your own little thing going on.

65
00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:38.558
She didn't by chance mention
anything about these, um,


66
00:04:38.558 --> 00:04:40.211
murmurs I've been hearing about

67
00:04:40.211 --> 00:04:42.605
there being an opening
for partner?


68
00:04:42.605 --> 00:04:45.652
Like I said,
she just wanted to check in.


69
00:04:45.652 --> 00:04:48.568
Gotcha. You done for the day?

70
00:04:48.568 --> 00:04:50.744
How about
we grab some celebratory drinks?


71
00:04:50.744 --> 00:04:53.573
Thank you for the invite,
but not tonight.


72
00:04:53.573 --> 00:04:56.184
- I've already got plans. Oh.
- Oh, she got plans.


73
00:04:56.184 --> 00:04:58.447
- Yeah. Okay, Michael, goodnight.
- What kind of plans?


74
00:04:58.447 --> 00:05:01.015
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Maybe I can call you after t...


75
00:05:34.831 --> 00:05:37.486
- Leah?
- Thank you.


76
00:06:01.379 --> 00:06:03.251
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Rachel. Hi!


77
00:06:03.251 --> 00:06:04.513
- <i>Leah, what's up?</i>
- Yeah.


78
00:06:04.513 --> 00:06:06.428
I got some pretty great news at

79
00:06:06.428 --> 00:06:08.648
work today and was thinking
about going out


80
00:06:08.648 --> 00:06:11.781
for an impromptu celebration.
You free?


81
00:06:11.781 --> 00:06:13.783
<i>Oh, I'm sorry.
I can't tonight.</i>


82
00:06:13.783 --> 00:06:16.307
Yeah, no worries. Next time.

83
00:06:16.307 --> 00:06:18.222
<i>- Okay, congrats, girl.</i>
- Thank you.


84
00:06:24.141 --> 00:06:27.928
<i>You've reached Mary.</i>

85
00:06:27.928 --> 00:06:29.843
<i>Sorry I
can't get to the phone. Leav...</i>


86
00:06:47.556 --> 00:06:50.602
- Oh, my goodness!
<i>- Hey, Kiki!</i>


87
00:06:50.602 --> 00:06:52.387
It really is you!

88
00:06:52.387 --> 00:06:53.910
<i>You know,
I could hardly believe when</i>


89
00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:55.825
I saw your name
come up on my phone.


90
00:06:55.825 --> 00:06:59.742
I know, I'm sorry it's been
so long. I've just been so--


91
00:06:59.742 --> 00:07:03.267
Busy, I know. You know,
the kids have been asking.


92
00:07:03.267 --> 00:07:05.530
<i>- About their Aunty Leah.</i>
- They have not.


93
00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:08.185
Well, they would if they ever
got a chance to meet you.


94
00:07:08.185 --> 00:07:12.233
<i>- How are you doing? Yeah?</i>
- I'm great.


95
00:07:12.233 --> 00:07:15.366
- <i>Yeah. You?</i>
- Uh, same, same.


96
00:07:15.366 --> 00:07:17.760
You know, servant and chauffer

97
00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:20.067
<i>and caterer and everything else
for the little ones.</i>


98
00:07:20.067 --> 00:07:22.547
- Lucky little ones.
- They deserve it.


99
00:07:22.547 --> 00:07:26.203
But, man, those days of staying
up all night in the dorm room


100
00:07:26.203 --> 00:07:29.424
<i>with you and gorging ourselves
on our meal plan at Parkside,</i>


101
00:07:29.424 --> 00:07:32.383
well, it couldn't seem
further away.


102
00:07:32.383 --> 00:07:34.821
Wait, did that happen
or did I just dream it?


103
00:07:34.821 --> 00:07:36.561
You know, I still have the photo

104
00:07:36.561 --> 00:07:38.738
from move-in day
on proud display.


105
00:07:38.738 --> 00:07:41.653
<i>Best random
rooming assignment ever.</i>


106
00:07:41.653 --> 00:07:44.613
So what's new in your world?

107
00:07:44.613 --> 00:07:48.835
Well, I got some pretty big news
at work today.


108
00:07:48.835 --> 00:07:51.533
<i>I found out I might be up
for partner at the company.</i>


109
00:07:51.533 --> 00:07:54.318
Leah, that's a really big deal!

110
00:07:54.318 --> 00:07:57.365
- <i>Hello, congrats! Oh.</i>
- Thank you.


111
00:07:57.365 --> 00:08:00.760
You know, John and I always said
that you would be the...


112
00:08:02.413 --> 00:08:04.589
I'm sorry. I-I-I don't know
why I said that.


113
00:08:04.589 --> 00:08:06.461
No, don't be sorry.

114
00:08:06.461 --> 00:08:09.725
So, are you dating anyone?

115
00:08:09.725 --> 00:08:11.596
- Nice segue.
<i>- Ha-ha-ha...</i>


116
00:08:11.596 --> 00:08:13.816
<i>No, I'm not dating anyone.
You know me.</i>


117
00:08:13.816 --> 00:08:16.123
I do know you, Leah.

118
00:08:16.123 --> 00:08:18.125
John wasn't the only guy
out there, you know?


119
00:08:18.125 --> 00:08:20.475
For me, maybe he was.

120
00:08:20.475 --> 00:08:24.522
And maybe a love like that, I
mean, like you have with Kenny,


121
00:08:24.522 --> 00:08:26.176
only comes around
once a lifetime.


122
00:08:26.176 --> 00:08:28.048
And I already had my go.

123
00:08:28.048 --> 00:08:30.137
<i>Yeah, I can't wait
to rub it in when one day</i>


124
00:08:30.137 --> 00:08:33.836
you tell me that you've fallen
madly in love with someone new


125
00:08:33.836 --> 00:08:36.665
<i>and you're gonna start having
some keiki of your own.</i>


126
00:08:36.665 --> 00:08:40.625
I have accepted
that John was that for me.


127
00:08:40.625 --> 00:08:43.498
He was my one chance,
and I blew it.


128
00:08:43.498 --> 00:08:45.848
If you keep telling yourself
that you're never gonna feel


129
00:08:45.848 --> 00:08:48.198
this way again,
then you never will.


130
00:08:48.198 --> 00:08:51.549
<i>You've got to be open
to the finding, Leah.</i>


131
00:08:51.549 --> 00:08:53.551
<i>Yes, John was your first love.</i>

132
00:08:53.551 --> 00:08:55.249
<i>But that doesn't mean
he's your last.</i>


133
00:08:55.249 --> 00:08:57.991
Yeah, but maybe he was.
And that's okay.


134
00:08:57.991 --> 00:09:03.170
I feel like I've leveled out
and I'm in this great place now.


135
00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:06.260
I just don't feel things so much anymore.

136
00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.654
You know I don't remember
the last time I cried?


137
00:09:09.654 --> 00:09:13.049
Maybe this is what
growing up is.


138
00:09:13.049 --> 00:09:15.095
N-now my food delivery
is all I need.


139
00:09:15.095 --> 00:09:17.880
- You sure about that?
- Oh, I'm sure.


140
00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:20.274
As long
as you're actually happy.


141
00:09:20.274 --> 00:09:24.931
Work is great, house is great,
life is great.


142
00:09:24.931 --> 00:09:27.324
- But?
- No, no buts.


143
00:09:27.324 --> 00:09:31.067
Hm. You know, you should come
pay a visit sometime.


144
00:09:31.067 --> 00:09:34.462
All that hard work must mean
you're due for a vacation.


145
00:09:34.462 --> 00:09:37.204
Ah, maybe soon, but right now
when I'm up for partner at


146
00:09:37.204 --> 00:09:40.076
the company, I just gotta tough
it out a little bit longer.


147
00:09:40.076 --> 00:09:42.774
- Mom!
- Uh, just a minute, Kealoha!


148
00:09:42.774 --> 00:09:44.254
The <i>keiki</i> are calling,
so I better go.


149
00:09:44.254 --> 00:09:46.039
But I'm glad you called, sis.

150
00:09:46.039 --> 00:09:48.606
Now go out and celebrate
that promotion


151
00:09:48.606 --> 00:09:50.739
and have an extra drink for me!

152
00:09:50.739 --> 00:09:54.090
You got it, Kiki.
Talk soon.


153
00:10:17.592 --> 00:10:18.680
Okay, thanks.

154
00:10:21.117 --> 00:10:23.250
- Good morning.
- Morning.


155
00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:25.556
Oh, Leah, may I see you
in my office for a moment?


156
00:10:25.556 --> 00:10:28.385
- Sure.
- Michael's already in there.


157
00:10:31.301 --> 00:10:32.650
I love that dress, Diana.

158
00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:34.304
Oh, thank you.

159
00:10:34.304 --> 00:10:36.654
Uh, please, after you.

160
00:10:41.007 --> 00:10:43.966
Big news, guys.

161
00:10:43.966 --> 00:10:45.707
We just caught word
that there is a property


162
00:10:45.707 --> 00:10:47.274
coming up for auction in Hawaii,

163
00:10:47.274 --> 00:10:49.145
one we've had our eyes on
for a while.


164
00:10:49.145 --> 00:10:51.582
Oh. I bet the Prescotts
will be pleased.


165
00:10:51.582 --> 00:10:54.629
Mm-hmm, exactly,
it's precisely the kind of place


166
00:10:54.629 --> 00:10:57.937
where we could develop a resort
they're looking to own.


167
00:10:57.937 --> 00:11:00.635
So I'm sending the two of you
out there to acquire it.


168
00:11:00.635 --> 00:11:02.680
- The two of us?
- Yes.


169
00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:06.380
The board wants you both to go
for this one. Our two best.


170
00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:08.643
I'm sure you've both heard
by now that there is


171
00:11:08.643 --> 00:11:11.385
a partner position
opening up here at Livvana.


172
00:11:11.385 --> 00:11:13.778
Well, they wanna see if you guys
can make this acquisition


173
00:11:13.778 --> 00:11:16.738
happen, and they wanna see
which one of you will do it.


174
00:11:16.738 --> 00:11:19.045
Which one of us?
A-aren't we on the same team?


175
00:11:19.045 --> 00:11:22.178
Not quite.
Uh, this isn't a normal auction.


176
00:11:22.178 --> 00:11:25.312
There're some rules in play here
we haven't dealt with before.


177
00:11:25.312 --> 00:11:27.705
The property currently belongs
to a family that's been there


178
00:11:27.705 --> 00:11:30.970
for generations,
but there's a big tax lien on it


179
00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:32.710
that they are not able to pay.

180
00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:34.712
Companies, however, are not able

181
00:11:34.712 --> 00:11:37.150
to bid on the lien.
Private bidders only.


182
00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:39.761
So you want us to go out there
and bid as private buyers.


183
00:11:39.761 --> 00:11:44.331
Yes. The family also gets a say
in who takes over the lien.


184
00:11:44.331 --> 00:11:48.552
So the board feels it would be
wise to give them options.


185
00:11:48.552 --> 00:11:50.685
That's why they're sending
both of you.


186
00:11:50.685 --> 00:11:52.817
- Right.
- Sounds good to me.


187
00:11:52.817 --> 00:11:54.341
So when do we leave?

188
00:11:54.341 --> 00:11:56.125
The auction is
at the end of the month,


189
00:11:56.125 --> 00:11:58.475
so I'm having your flights
booked for tomorrow.


190
00:11:58.475 --> 00:12:01.957
It's going to take time
to build trust with the family.


191
00:12:01.957 --> 00:12:03.219
The sooner you get started,
the better.


192
00:12:03.219 --> 00:12:04.742
How are we supposed
to build trust


193
00:12:04.742 --> 00:12:07.006
with this family
we've never met?


194
00:12:07.006 --> 00:12:08.485
Well, that's
for two of my best buyers


195
00:12:08.485 --> 00:12:11.662
in front of me to figure out.

196
00:12:11.662 --> 00:12:14.448
Don't you know someone
out there? Your college friend?


197
00:12:14.448 --> 00:12:17.407
Uh, yeah. We talked just last
night, actually. So weird.


198
00:12:17.407 --> 00:12:23.109
Oh, well, maybe not. See, you're
already connected. It's a sign.


199
00:12:23.109 --> 00:12:25.154
So pack your bags,
and let's see


200
00:12:25.154 --> 00:12:28.070
who can secure us
this deal of a lifetime.


201
00:12:37.819 --> 00:12:39.560
<i>Aloha,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>


202
00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:42.780
<i>Let me be the first to welcome
you to beautiful Hawaii.</i>


203
00:12:52.181 --> 00:12:54.140
Sorry about that, George,
we just arrived,


204
00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:56.098
so I haven't gotten online yet,
I'll take a look


205
00:12:56.098 --> 00:12:59.884
as soon as we get to the room.
Yup, I'll call you then, bye.


206
00:13:01.756 --> 00:13:04.889
- Oh, my gosh. I'm so sorry.
- Oh! Oh, I'm so sorry, miss.


207
00:13:04.889 --> 00:13:06.413
- Apologies.
- No, it was my fault.


208
00:13:06.413 --> 00:13:07.675
I wasn't looking and I...

209
00:13:11.026 --> 00:13:14.421
Uh, I wasn't either. Apologies.

210
00:13:16.162 --> 00:13:17.815
- Can I help you with those?
- Yes.


211
00:13:17.815 --> 00:13:21.515
Uh, no, I've got it.
Thank you. Um...


212
00:13:21.515 --> 00:13:25.780
I'm sorry. I-I was just looking
on my phone and I...


213
00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:29.175
- Wow.
- Pretty great, huh?


214
00:13:29.175 --> 00:13:31.133
This is what you were missing
because of that thing.


215
00:13:32.352 --> 00:13:34.093
First time here?

216
00:13:34.093 --> 00:13:35.746
Yes.

217
00:13:35.746 --> 00:13:39.054
- Welcome.
- Thank you.


218
00:13:39.054 --> 00:13:41.491
Your first time, too?

219
00:13:41.491 --> 00:13:44.494
Yes, this is my first time
at this hotel.


220
00:13:44.494 --> 00:13:47.845
We're pleased to have you. I'm
the activities director here.


221
00:13:47.845 --> 00:13:49.760
- Ikaika.
- Leah.


222
00:13:51.022 --> 00:13:51.980
Michael.

223
00:13:53.503 --> 00:13:56.680
Well, pleasure.
Um, great to meet you guys.


224
00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:58.465
Uh, we have our happy-hour
live entertainment


225
00:13:58.465 --> 00:14:00.510
down in the main lawn
in an hour.


226
00:14:00.510 --> 00:14:02.033
Check it out
if you guys are free.


227
00:14:02.033 --> 00:14:03.731
We'll try and make it.
Thank you.


228
00:14:09.519 --> 00:14:12.261
Are you sure you're okay?
He really slammed into you.


229
00:14:12.261 --> 00:14:16.135
- You could be concussed.
- Yeah, uh, he...


230
00:14:16.135 --> 00:14:19.877
I'm fine. I mean,
look at this incredible view!


231
00:14:19.877 --> 00:14:22.358
Yeah, yeah, I guess
there are worse places


232
00:14:22.358 --> 00:14:25.535
to compete head-to-head
for firm partner.


233
00:14:25.535 --> 00:14:28.147
He said there's
entertainment in an hour? Well.


234
00:14:28.147 --> 00:14:30.323
Wanna go settle in and then
you can meet me for a drink?


235
00:14:30.323 --> 00:14:31.628
Okay. Sure.

236
00:15:24.681 --> 00:15:26.335
Thank you.

237
00:15:28.729 --> 00:15:30.687
May the best man win.

238
00:15:30.687 --> 00:15:33.995
- May we do good work.
- Whatever.


239
00:15:33.995 --> 00:15:36.563
<i>Aloha</i> and <i>e komo mai.</i>

240
00:15:36.563 --> 00:15:38.869
Good evening and welcome,
everyone, my name is Ikaika,


241
00:15:38.869 --> 00:15:40.654
and I'll be your MC
for the evening.


242
00:15:40.654 --> 00:15:43.134
I hope you are all enjoying
your stay here with us.


243
00:15:48.749 --> 00:15:51.230
I would love to introduce to you
our beautiful singer


244
00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:52.753
for the evening, Mahulani. Please.

245
00:15:52.753 --> 00:15:54.320
Let's give her
a round of applause.


246
00:15:57.932 --> 00:16:01.327
And we've got a very special
treat for you all today.


247
00:16:01.327 --> 00:16:03.067
For those of you who don't know,

248
00:16:03.067 --> 00:16:05.374
<i>hula</i> is a dance
unique to Hawaii.


249
00:16:05.374 --> 00:16:08.247
It portrays our prophecy
and history alike


250
00:16:08.247 --> 00:16:09.726
and it connects us
with the tales


251
00:16:09.726 --> 00:16:12.120
and stories of our ancestors.

252
00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:14.165
Visiting us from
the beautiful island of Maui,


253
00:16:14.165 --> 00:16:16.211
my Cousin Kehaulani
will be sharing


254
00:16:16.211 --> 00:16:18.431
a little bit of <i>hula</i>
to all of you.


255
00:17:56.746 --> 00:17:59.270
<i>Mahalo,</i> Kehaulani!

256
00:17:59.270 --> 00:18:02.230
Let's give her another round
of applause, everyone.


257
00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:05.625
That was something I guess
you can call it entertaining.


258
00:18:05.625 --> 00:18:07.540
Should we get another round
of drinks? Tsk, tsk.


259
00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:09.585
Ah, not for me, 
I don't think.

260
00:18:09.585 --> 00:18:12.066
I'm-I'm feeling a little strange
all of a sudden.


261
00:18:12.066 --> 00:18:15.243
I'm gonna go back to the room
to lie down for a bit.


262
00:18:15.243 --> 00:18:17.680
- You all right?
- Yeah. Um...


263
00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:22.250
Probably just jet lag.
Uh, I'll see you in the morning.


264
00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:24.426
And another round of applause
for Mahulani.


265
00:18:49.973 --> 00:18:52.454
- Morning, sunshine.
- Oh! Good morning.


266
00:18:52.454 --> 00:18:55.588
- You feeling a little better?
- Much. Thank you.


267
00:18:55.588 --> 00:18:59.418
Like I said, it was nothing.
Just needed some sleep.


268
00:18:59.418 --> 00:19:02.203
- Ready to go to the property?
- Born ready.


269
00:19:02.203 --> 00:19:04.684
- Hm. Sure.
- You mind driving?


270
00:19:19.002 --> 00:19:21.570
Okay, huh,
so this is what's got


271
00:19:21.570 --> 00:19:23.659
Diana and the Prescotts
all hot and bothered?


272
00:19:23.659 --> 00:19:26.401
I think it's beautiful.

273
00:19:26.401 --> 00:19:29.360
Maybe when we're done with it.

274
00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:30.710
- W-wait.
- What?


275
00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:32.320
Shouldn't we ask for permission
first?


276
00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:33.408
Why?

277
00:19:35.323 --> 00:19:37.281
- Who's there?
- Good morning. Uh...


278
00:19:37.281 --> 00:19:39.327
My name is Leah.
This is Michael.


279
00:19:39.327 --> 00:19:40.981
We're here to see the property
that's going into auction


280
00:19:40.981 --> 00:19:42.504
at the end of the month.

281
00:19:42.504 --> 00:19:45.072
Of course you are.
It's always the <i>haoles.</i>


282
00:19:45.072 --> 00:19:46.900
- Pardon me?
- We're a little busy today.


283
00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:49.380
But you can come back for
the scheduled tour on Wednesday.


284
00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:51.208
Actually, we were hoping
that maybe we could get this


285
00:19:51.208 --> 00:19:53.820
conversation rolling
a little bit before Wednesday.


286
00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:55.343
You wouldn't happen to be
one of the family members


287
00:19:55.343 --> 00:19:56.605
that's responsible
for putting this


288
00:19:56.605 --> 00:19:58.085
beautiful property up for sale?

289
00:19:58.085 --> 00:19:59.695
It's not for sale.

290
00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:05.962
That went well.

291
00:20:05.962 --> 00:20:07.616
This is gonna be fun.

292
00:20:11.533 --> 00:20:14.536
- Kiki!
- Aw, it's really you!


293
00:20:14.536 --> 00:20:17.931
I'm sorry it took so long.

294
00:20:17.931 --> 00:20:21.543
Well, the kids are at school,
but let's sit and talk story.


295
00:20:21.543 --> 00:20:24.546
You could tell me about
your trip and everything else.


296
00:20:24.546 --> 00:20:26.592
Hey, come on, come on, okay.

297
00:20:31.031 --> 00:20:33.860
I don't know, Leah.
That sounds tricky to me.


298
00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:36.732
I know it is, but honestly,
somebody's gonna do it.


299
00:20:36.732 --> 00:20:39.692
It might as well be my company.

300
00:20:39.692 --> 00:20:43.217
We're not as unsporting
as the others.


301
00:20:43.217 --> 00:20:45.524
I mean, at least we actually pay
what properties are worth.


302
00:20:45.524 --> 00:20:48.396
But they're having you go up
against your partner for it too?


303
00:20:48.396 --> 00:20:51.268
- My colleague, yes.
- Some company.


304
00:20:51.268 --> 00:20:53.009
I mean,
that's the nature of business.


305
00:20:53.009 --> 00:20:54.794
At the end of the day,
this family's going to walk away


306
00:20:54.794 --> 00:20:59.059
with a lot of money,
it's gonna change their lives.


307
00:20:59.059 --> 00:21:02.323
Maybe they don't want
their lives to change.


308
00:21:02.323 --> 00:21:04.238
Change is inevitable, Kiki.

309
00:21:04.238 --> 00:21:06.588
Might as well be
comfortable, too.


310
00:21:06.588 --> 00:21:09.199
What?

311
00:21:09.199 --> 00:21:12.072
Forgive me, sis,
but I can't help but remember


312
00:21:12.072 --> 00:21:14.596
all the things that you used
to talk about in school.


313
00:21:14.596 --> 00:21:16.772
About building
sustainable housing


314
00:21:16.772 --> 00:21:18.905
and community resources
and just...


315
00:21:18.905 --> 00:21:23.126
Wow, Kiki.
Yeah, I had so many dreams.


316
00:21:23.126 --> 00:21:25.172
I mean, I would still love to do
those things.


317
00:21:25.172 --> 00:21:27.870
And to be honest, I have been
saving up so that I can one day.


318
00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:31.265
But I have to earn my way there
first, I guess.


319
00:21:31.265 --> 00:21:32.832
That's what I'm trying to do.

320
00:21:37.358 --> 00:21:41.405
Man, it really is everything
you said out here.


321
00:21:41.405 --> 00:21:43.843
Yeah, now you see
why I never came back to LA.


322
00:21:43.843 --> 00:21:47.237
- I can't blame you.
- Where are you staying?


323
00:21:47.237 --> 00:21:50.589
At the Hale Hotel.
Yeah, it's nice.


324
00:21:50.589 --> 00:21:54.549
There was even a hula dancer
last night that, um...


325
00:21:54.549 --> 00:21:57.465
- That what?
- I don't know.


326
00:21:57.465 --> 00:22:00.686
Uh, watching her,
this kinda sounds silly,


327
00:22:00.686 --> 00:22:05.560
I, I felt something.

328
00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:09.651
This coming from the woman
who said just a couple days ago


329
00:22:09.651 --> 00:22:11.610
she couldn't feel anything anymore.

330
00:22:11.610 --> 00:22:14.656
I know, I know, but, yeah,

331
00:22:14.656 --> 00:22:17.659
watching her dance, uh,

332
00:22:17.659 --> 00:22:20.793
the look on her face,
it was just pure joy


333
00:22:20.793 --> 00:22:24.492
or-or longing,
or-or maybe both.


334
00:22:24.492 --> 00:22:29.149
I-I don't know. I wanted
to feel that. Is that crazy?


335
00:22:29.149 --> 00:22:32.326
That must have been
a great dancer.


336
00:22:32.326 --> 00:22:34.023
Well, it sounds like
they're stepping up


337
00:22:34.023 --> 00:22:35.677
the <i>haole</i> entertainment
over there, huh?


338
00:22:35.677 --> 00:22:37.418
What is this word you're saying?

339
00:22:37.418 --> 00:22:39.289
<i>- Haole?</i>
- Yeah. What does it mean?


340
00:22:39.289 --> 00:22:40.943
Uh, it's what you are.

341
00:22:40.943 --> 00:22:43.772
You know, not from here.

342
00:22:43.772 --> 00:22:45.382
Yeah, that's what the woman
called us today.


343
00:22:45.382 --> 00:22:47.297
Oh, well, don't be surprised

344
00:22:47.297 --> 00:22:49.517
when everybody here
calls you that.


345
00:22:49.517 --> 00:22:53.956
- Is it bad?
- No. It, it just is.


346
00:22:53.956 --> 00:22:57.438
Now, let's get your <i>haole okole</i>
up and over here.


347
00:22:57.438 --> 00:22:59.092
I wanna give you a full tour
before you go.


348
00:22:59.092 --> 00:23:00.528
- Okay, <i>okole?</i>
- Yeah.


349
00:23:00.528 --> 00:23:01.703
That's what you've
been sitting on, girl.


350
00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:09.058
Hi, Diana.

351
00:23:09.058 --> 00:23:10.277
<i>Haven't heard
from you yet.</i>


352
00:23:10.277 --> 00:23:11.582
Michael called me first thing

353
00:23:11.582 --> 00:23:13.106
after you guys
left the property.


354
00:23:13.106 --> 00:23:15.761
Well, that surprises me.
There wasn't much to tell.


355
00:23:15.761 --> 00:23:17.806
I mean, the property
is beautiful, I already


356
00:23:17.806 --> 00:23:19.286
have some ideas
as to how to build


357
00:23:19.286 --> 00:23:21.070
things around the natural lay
of the land.


358
00:23:21.070 --> 00:23:23.725
Uh, Michael thinks the whole
thing would need to be leveled


359
00:23:23.725 --> 00:23:27.424
so we can start fresh.
And I'm inclined to agree.


360
00:23:27.424 --> 00:23:29.775
Really? I think
that would be a mistake.


361
00:23:29.775 --> 00:23:32.560
Now is not the time
to be branching out.


362
00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:35.476
Not when you have
this competition going on.


363
00:23:35.476 --> 00:23:38.131
- Competition?
<i>- Why call it anything else?</i>


364
00:23:38.131 --> 00:23:40.655
My hands are tied here, Leah,
I just don't want you making


365
00:23:40.655 --> 00:23:44.964
choices that might jeopardize
your future, you know?


366
00:23:44.964 --> 00:23:47.749
<i>Aloha,</i> everybody. It's time
for our group <i>hula</i> lesson.


367
00:23:47.749 --> 00:23:49.882
Well, I thought you said
the board loves me.


368
00:23:49.882 --> 00:23:52.014
Do I have any volunteers
to come on up and help me...


369
00:23:52.014 --> 00:23:56.018
The board is still
very old-school business.


370
00:23:56.018 --> 00:24:00.980
And the idea of a woman partner
is a bit more new-school.


371
00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:04.287
They have these ideas of what
makes a successful executive,


372
00:24:04.287 --> 00:24:07.247
and they're going to be
watching you closely.


373
00:24:07.247 --> 00:24:08.944
Hey, you on the phone.

374
00:24:08.944 --> 00:24:11.207
This is a no-cell-phone
activity zone.


375
00:24:11.207 --> 00:24:13.775
Put that phone away or I'm going
to make you a volunteer.


376
00:24:13.775 --> 00:24:16.778
- Look, I understand that, but--
- Fine. I'm gonna get you.


377
00:24:16.778 --> 00:24:20.303
Uh, listen, Diana, I have to go,
but I, I will get back to you


378
00:24:20.303 --> 00:24:24.177
very soon, uh, with my thoughts
on the property.


379
00:24:24.177 --> 00:24:26.309
Thanks, bye.

380
00:24:28.834 --> 00:24:30.923
Let that be a lesson
to all of you.


381
00:24:30.923 --> 00:24:34.448
We take our cell-phone rule
very seriously.


382
00:24:34.448 --> 00:24:38.669
Now, the lovely Leah is going
to learn <i>hula</i> and dance with me


383
00:24:38.669 --> 00:24:43.544
one of our most cherished
<i>hapa haole</i> songs.


384
00:24:43.544 --> 00:24:46.982
Now, first we start
with the feet.


385
00:24:46.982 --> 00:24:49.115
All right? Like this, follow me.

386
00:24:53.119 --> 00:24:55.164
- Come on.
- Do I have to?


387
00:24:55.164 --> 00:24:57.558
The sooner you start,
the sooner it'll be over.


388
00:25:00.126 --> 00:25:01.562
I have to call you back.

389
00:25:02.868 --> 00:25:04.043
There you go.

390
00:25:06.959 --> 00:25:09.309
Next is the hips.

391
00:25:09.309 --> 00:25:11.790
Ey, you're a natural. Let's give
Leah a little bit of love!


392
00:25:11.790 --> 00:25:14.967
Everybody!

393
00:25:14.967 --> 00:25:18.274
Now for the fun part.
<i>Hula</i> tells a story.


394
00:25:18.274 --> 00:25:20.276
So follow my hands and arms

395
00:25:20.276 --> 00:25:22.191
and help tell this love story
with me.


396
00:26:39.181 --> 00:26:42.576
Let's give another round
of applause to Leah, everybody.


397
00:26:42.576 --> 00:26:45.666
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

398
00:26:45.666 --> 00:26:48.930
Thank you so much
for being a good sport.


399
00:26:48.930 --> 00:26:51.324
All right, now let's get
everybody on stage with me.


400
00:26:51.324 --> 00:26:53.108
Let's do it all together!

401
00:26:55.284 --> 00:26:58.244
- Hey, that was great up there.
- Oh, gosh, I...


402
00:26:58.244 --> 00:26:59.941
You're the dancer
from last night.


403
00:26:59.941 --> 00:27:03.075
That was beautiful!
I mean, you made me cry.


404
00:27:03.075 --> 00:27:04.772
- Thank you.
- No, truly.


405
00:27:04.772 --> 00:27:07.166
You made me feel things
I didn't know I could feel.


406
00:27:07.166 --> 00:27:09.690
- It was lovely.
<i>- Mahalo.</i> You know...


407
00:27:09.690 --> 00:27:12.388
<i>Hula</i> has always been special to
me, and it's so great to see new


408
00:27:12.388 --> 00:27:15.130
people connect with it. Have you
ever thought about learning?


409
00:27:15.130 --> 00:27:18.829
Oh, no. I, I mean, I didn't ever
see it until you last night.


410
00:27:18.829 --> 00:27:22.007
I-I think I would remember
seeing something that beautiful.


411
00:27:22.007 --> 00:27:24.487
Well, if it calls to you...

412
00:27:26.272 --> 00:27:28.013
I just wanted to let you know
you did great up there.


413
00:27:28.013 --> 00:27:31.538
Even Ikaika was impressed,
and he's never impressed before.


414
00:27:31.538 --> 00:27:35.629
Well, thank you.
It was a pleasure meeting you.


415
00:27:35.629 --> 00:27:36.717
You, too.

416
00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:42.114
- Wow! That was cool.
- Ah, come on.


417
00:27:42.114 --> 00:27:43.724
You showing all those moves.

418
00:27:47.815 --> 00:27:50.992
That was crazy!
That was crazy, Leah.


419
00:27:50.992 --> 00:27:52.646
I gotta hand it to you, though,
I would've never done


420
00:27:52.646 --> 00:27:54.648
anything like that, I wouldn't
have been caught dead...


421
00:27:54.648 --> 00:27:57.259
- Doing what you did up there.
- Gee, thanks, Michael.


422
00:27:57.259 --> 00:27:59.087
I didn't choose to go up there.
He made me.


423
00:27:59.087 --> 00:28:00.741
Why did you let him
force you to do it?


424
00:28:00.741 --> 00:28:03.004
I would have just kept walking.
Buh-bye.


425
00:28:03.004 --> 00:28:05.006
I guess I'm not as dismissive
as you are.


426
00:28:05.006 --> 00:28:09.445
Hold that thought. Oh.
Hi, Diana.


427
00:28:09.445 --> 00:28:11.708
No, no, it's a little bit
quieter now.


428
00:28:11.708 --> 00:28:16.017
No, no,
she isn't dancing anymore.


429
00:28:16.017 --> 00:28:19.847
She's actually sitting right
here next to me. Ah, uh-huh.


430
00:28:19.847 --> 00:28:22.328
Yeah, you-you wanna...
I'm sure she would love to.


431
00:28:22.328 --> 00:28:23.764
She wants to talk to you.

432
00:28:23.764 --> 00:28:28.116
Oh. Okay. Diana, hi.

433
00:28:28.116 --> 00:28:30.379
Yeah, it was right when
we were on the phone earlier.


434
00:28:30.379 --> 00:28:33.034
I thought I told you
to take this seriously.


435
00:28:33.034 --> 00:28:35.167
Do you know what the guys
on the board would say


436
00:28:35.167 --> 00:28:37.865
if they saw you making a fool
of yourself like that?


437
00:28:37.865 --> 00:28:40.955
- No one is going to see.
<i>- Michael said he took a video.</i>


438
00:28:40.955 --> 00:28:42.348
He what?

439
00:28:44.263 --> 00:28:47.048
It was just
a silly hotel-tourist thing.


440
00:28:47.048 --> 00:28:48.658
I
-I... It was a one-time thing.

441
00:28:48.658 --> 00:28:51.618
We don't need anything
making you look soft, okay?


442
00:28:51.618 --> 00:28:53.576
<i>Or anything
to make the board think that</i>


443
00:28:53.576 --> 00:28:55.839
I'm making a mistake
by backing you, too.


444
00:28:55.839 --> 00:28:58.973
<i>Please, try to focus
on the end goal here.</i>


445
00:28:58.973 --> 00:29:00.453
Yeah, you got it.

446
00:29:00.453 --> 00:29:02.498
I'll check in with you guys
tomorrow, okay?


447
00:29:02.498 --> 00:29:03.978
<i>Bye, Diana.</i>

448
00:29:09.114 --> 00:29:10.985
You told her I was up there?

449
00:29:10.985 --> 00:29:12.769
Yes, she called

450
00:29:12.769 --> 00:29:14.728
while you were up there and she
wanted to know where you were.


451
00:29:14.728 --> 00:29:18.688
- And you took a video?
- I did, yeah. But it was funny.


452
00:29:18.688 --> 00:29:20.603
I mean,
it was, it was fun.


453
00:29:20.603 --> 00:29:22.823
You would, uh...
You wanna see it? I...


454
00:29:22.823 --> 00:29:24.999
You don't wanna see it. Where
you going? I can delete it.


455
00:29:24.999 --> 00:29:26.305
- To get some work done.
- I'll delete it.


456
00:29:26.305 --> 00:29:28.307
It's not a big, um...

457
00:29:31.005 --> 00:29:32.137
Deleted.

458
00:29:34.226 --> 00:29:35.792
That's great, George. Thank you.

459
00:29:35.792 --> 00:29:37.925
Yeah, I'll send an email
to Diana right now.


460
00:29:37.925 --> 00:29:40.058
Have a great night. Bye.

461
00:29:42.799 --> 00:29:48.414
Hey, Diana. Just closed
on the Howard Ranch.


462
00:29:48.414 --> 00:29:52.157
Will send you all the details tomorrow.

463
00:29:55.029 --> 00:29:57.292
Sorry about the...

464
00:30:05.561 --> 00:30:06.649
Send.

465
00:30:28.628 --> 00:30:31.457
What are you doing, Leah? Oh.

466
00:30:36.723 --> 00:30:39.856
Good morning.

467
00:30:39.856 --> 00:30:41.945
<i>Good morning, I wanted
to see if you were ready</i>


468
00:30:41.945 --> 00:30:43.556
<i>to head over to the property together.</i>

469
00:30:43.556 --> 00:30:45.384
<i>Maybe we can grab some coffee
on the way?</i>


470
00:30:45.384 --> 00:30:49.083
Um, I actually think I'm gonna
do my own thing today.


471
00:30:49.083 --> 00:30:51.085
<i>Ah. Are you still mad
at me about yesterday?</i>


472
00:30:51.085 --> 00:30:53.131
I just don't think it makes
sense for us to be doing


473
00:30:53.131 --> 00:30:55.350
these visits together when
you're constantly reminding me


474
00:30:55.350 --> 00:30:59.441
that we're competing and are not
actually a team on this.


475
00:30:59.441 --> 00:31:02.183
<i>Uh, okay,
I'll take that as a yes.</i>


476
00:31:02.183 --> 00:31:04.011
Maybe I'll see you there.
Bye, Michael.


477
00:31:04.011 --> 00:31:05.230
<i>Maybe I'll see you...</i>

478
00:31:13.977 --> 00:31:15.805
Yeah, this looks like
a <i>pa'u.</i>


479
00:31:19.461 --> 00:31:20.506
Leah!

480
00:31:23.291 --> 00:31:25.511
- Ikaika. Good morning.
- Hi.


481
00:31:25.511 --> 00:31:28.078
I almost didn't recognize you
without your cell phone.


482
00:31:28.078 --> 00:31:29.515
I almost didn't recognize you

483
00:31:29.515 --> 00:31:32.474
without your microphone
and audience.


484
00:31:32.474 --> 00:31:33.910
<i>Touche.</i>

485
00:31:33.910 --> 00:31:35.434
Um, sorry,
but it's a thing we do


486
00:31:35.434 --> 00:31:36.913
out here, calling out the guests
like that.


487
00:31:36.913 --> 00:31:39.046
- How fun for us.
- Oh, so much tension.


488
00:31:39.046 --> 00:31:40.743
We gotta teach you
how to hang loose.


489
00:31:40.743 --> 00:31:43.050
Some of us have too much work
to do to hang loose.


490
00:31:43.050 --> 00:31:46.271
I don't know, you did
pretty great up there yesterday.


491
00:31:46.271 --> 00:31:48.098
Have you ever
danced <i>hula</i> before?


492
00:31:48.098 --> 00:31:51.058
- No.
- Well, you're a natural at it.


493
00:31:51.058 --> 00:31:53.974
- Are you making fun of me?
- This time I'm not, actually.


494
00:31:53.974 --> 00:31:57.064
I mean it. Seriously, you should
put that phone down more often.


495
00:31:57.064 --> 00:31:58.892
A different side of you
comes out.


496
00:32:02.548 --> 00:32:04.463
Oh, what the heck.

497
00:32:04.463 --> 00:32:07.379
At the risk of sounding
totally insane,


498
00:32:07.379 --> 00:32:11.600
you don't teach <i>hula,</i>
per chance?


499
00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:14.864
- I-is this a real question?
- Yes.


500
00:32:14.864 --> 00:32:17.867
Well, sure. Yeah, we do
group lessons here every day.


501
00:32:17.867 --> 00:32:21.480
I don't want group lessons.
I need something more private.


502
00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:25.440
- Do you do that?
- No, not really.


503
00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:28.008
Uh, what about that dancer
you featured the other night?


504
00:32:28.008 --> 00:32:29.836
You said she's your cousin.
Kehaulani?


505
00:32:29.836 --> 00:32:31.707
- Yeah.
- Uh, does she teach?


506
00:32:31.707 --> 00:32:34.232
Well, she left earlier for Maui
this morning.


507
00:32:34.232 --> 00:32:37.278
- No worries, thank you.
- Well, why do you wanna learn?


508
00:32:39.324 --> 00:32:41.674
I
-I don't know...

509
00:32:41.674 --> 00:32:44.459
I felt compelled to ask.
That's all.


510
00:32:46.244 --> 00:32:47.332
Have a good day.

511
00:32:51.205 --> 00:32:54.382
S-so, hey, cuz.

512
00:32:54.382 --> 00:32:56.384
What's up with you
and that <i>wahine?</i>


513
00:32:56.384 --> 00:32:57.646
- Nothing.
- Yeah.


514
00:32:57.646 --> 00:33:00.345
That didn't look
like nothing, brah.


515
00:33:00.345 --> 00:33:02.042
She's a guest here at the hotel.

516
00:33:02.042 --> 00:33:04.566
She was just asking about
taking <i>hula</i> lessons.


517
00:33:13.619 --> 00:33:15.142
Oh. Hello!

518
00:34:46.712 --> 00:34:48.714
Gotta clean the vine
off the tea leaf.


519
00:34:48.714 --> 00:34:52.935
- All that stuff.
- I know. Uh, I know.


520
00:34:52.935 --> 00:34:56.199
What's this? Must be for aunty.

521
00:35:01.248 --> 00:35:02.858
Cuz, you know I grew up with you
my whole life.


522
00:35:02.858 --> 00:35:04.686
- But you know I just realized.
- What's that?


523
00:35:04.686 --> 00:35:06.601
You look like the kind,
you know, that,


524
00:35:06.601 --> 00:35:09.169
that guy from
that brewing company commercial.


525
00:35:09.169 --> 00:35:11.563
- You think so?
- Yeah.


526
00:35:11.563 --> 00:35:14.479
I mean, so identical,
like, chicken-skin identical.


527
00:35:14.479 --> 00:35:16.698
Yeah. Ah, come on.

528
00:35:20.572 --> 00:35:22.704
- Hi, <i>kumu.</i>
- Billy.


529
00:35:22.704 --> 00:35:25.141
<i>Aloha.</i>

530
00:35:25.141 --> 00:35:27.448
Ah, this note
was on the gate for you.


531
00:35:27.448 --> 00:35:29.537
The phone number of another
<i>haole</i> who wants to take over


532
00:35:29.537 --> 00:35:31.539
the place. I saw her leave it.

533
00:35:31.539 --> 00:35:34.107
<i>Aloha,</i> mama. Where do you
want me to put these?


534
00:35:34.107 --> 00:35:36.022
Barely even a hello
for your mother before you get


535
00:35:36.022 --> 00:35:39.634
to business?
Those can go back over there.


536
00:35:39.634 --> 00:35:42.115
Sometimes I think if you didn't
need to borrow things


537
00:35:42.115 --> 00:35:44.813
from the <i>halau</i>
for your silly tourist shows,


538
00:35:44.813 --> 00:35:46.511
I would never
get to see you anymore.


539
00:35:46.511 --> 00:35:48.251
I see you
every couple of days, ma.


540
00:35:48.251 --> 00:35:49.339
And the only reason
why I'm doing


541
00:35:49.339 --> 00:35:51.298
the hotel job is for the <i>halau.</i>

542
00:35:51.298 --> 00:35:53.039
Oh, cuz, you should tell <i>kumu</i>
about that <i>haole</i>


543
00:35:53.039 --> 00:35:54.693
at your hotel that wanted
the private lessons.


544
00:35:54.693 --> 00:35:56.782
- She might have money.
- What is this?


545
00:35:56.782 --> 00:35:58.479
You don't wanna be a <i>kumu,</i>
but you wanna start


546
00:35:58.479 --> 00:36:00.438
teaching private lessons
to tourists?


547
00:36:00.438 --> 00:36:02.570
That's not what's happening
at all.


548
00:36:02.570 --> 00:36:05.399
One of the guests at the hotel
saw Cousin Kehaulani dance,


549
00:36:05.399 --> 00:36:07.401
and she danced at one of
the participation activities,


550
00:36:07.401 --> 00:36:09.316
and she seemed to love it,
because she asked


551
00:36:09.316 --> 00:36:11.100
about taking private lessons
to learn more.


552
00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:13.363
- You're not a <i>kumu.</i>
- Obviously.


553
00:36:13.363 --> 00:36:16.323
Yeah, but, aunty, this woman,
she looked like she could pay.


554
00:36:16.323 --> 00:36:17.846
I told her I didn't teach.

555
00:36:17.846 --> 00:36:19.631
Yeah, but you're not gonna
show her anything real.


556
00:36:19.631 --> 00:36:21.110
Just spend some time showing her
<i>Hukilau</i> and--


557
00:36:21.110 --> 00:36:23.678
She's not gonna be happy
with just <i>Hukilau.</i>


558
00:36:23.678 --> 00:36:26.072
What's going on between you
and this <i>haole?</i>


559
00:36:27.595 --> 00:36:29.467
Nothing. I
-I just told you.

560
00:36:33.209 --> 00:36:36.343
For once Billy might be right.

561
00:36:36.343 --> 00:36:38.301
You can teach the <i>haole.</i>

562
00:36:38.301 --> 00:36:39.999
Goodness knows
we need all the money


563
00:36:39.999 --> 00:36:41.783
we can get right now.

564
00:36:41.783 --> 00:36:45.483
But only <i>hapa haole,</i> understand?

565
00:36:46.527 --> 00:36:47.876
Yeah, of course.

566
00:37:03.501 --> 00:37:05.981
Trading the phone
for another device, I see.


567
00:37:05.981 --> 00:37:08.331
I can't be the only person
on the island


568
00:37:08.331 --> 00:37:09.724
trying to get work done.

569
00:37:09.724 --> 00:37:11.857
No, but you might be
the only person doing it


570
00:37:11.857 --> 00:37:15.382
at the bar of what is typically
a vacation resort.


571
00:37:15.382 --> 00:37:17.950
How's it? I didn't think
you were working tonight.


572
00:37:17.950 --> 00:37:20.692
I'm not. Just here to see
this lovely lady.


573
00:37:20.692 --> 00:37:24.609
- Is that so?
- It is, indeed.


574
00:37:24.609 --> 00:37:28.003
I wanted to tell you that,
after careful consideration,


575
00:37:28.003 --> 00:37:30.484
I have decided
that I will teach you <i>hula.</i>


576
00:37:30.484 --> 00:37:32.965
- If you still want to learn.
- You will?


577
00:37:32.965 --> 00:37:34.967
Under a few conditions.

578
00:37:34.967 --> 00:37:37.709
One, no phones.

579
00:37:37.709 --> 00:37:39.885
Two. And this came
from the <i>kumu--</i>


580
00:37:39.885 --> 00:37:42.235
- What's a <i>kumu?</i>
- A teacher.


581
00:37:42.235 --> 00:37:44.803
- A <i>kumu hula</i> is a <i>hula</i> teacher.
- Like you.


582
00:37:44.803 --> 00:37:48.067
No. I'm not a <i>kumu.</i>

583
00:37:48.067 --> 00:37:50.373
Normally if you want to learn
<i>hula,</i> you would have to join


584
00:37:50.373 --> 00:37:52.332
a <i>halau,</i> a <i>hula</i> school,
so to speak.


585
00:37:52.332 --> 00:37:55.291
And the teacher and leader
of the <i>halau</i> is the <i>kumu hula.</i>


586
00:37:55.291 --> 00:37:56.989
But that really means
joining the <i>ohana</i>


587
00:37:56.989 --> 00:37:59.078
and committing for
a long journey, and frankly,


588
00:37:59.078 --> 00:38:01.602
no <i>halau</i> is just gonna let
anyone join on a whim.


589
00:38:01.602 --> 00:38:04.170
Especially not someone just
visiting here for a short time.


590
00:38:04.170 --> 00:38:07.826
And the <i>kumu</i> who taught me,
in particular,


591
00:38:07.826 --> 00:38:10.393
is very discerning
as to who she will accept


592
00:38:10.393 --> 00:38:13.222
as <i>haumana</i> students.

593
00:38:13.222 --> 00:38:15.703
So you're saying
you can't teach me.


594
00:38:15.703 --> 00:38:19.141
Um, I'm explaining that
I'm not a <i>kumu,</i>


595
00:38:19.141 --> 00:38:22.014
though I thought that's what I
was going to be for a long time.


596
00:38:22.014 --> 00:38:25.800
So, two, what we are going
to learn is very informal


597
00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:27.280
and just scraping the surface of

598
00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:29.717
what we can learn
outside of a <i>halau.</i>


599
00:38:29.717 --> 00:38:32.851
Only English songs,
only basic moves,


600
00:38:32.851 --> 00:38:34.592
what we call <i>hapa haole.</i>

601
00:38:34.592 --> 00:38:36.463
If you wanna dive deeper
into the styles


602
00:38:36.463 --> 00:38:38.421
we call <i>'auana</i> or <i>kahiko,</i>

603
00:38:38.421 --> 00:38:40.772
traditional <i>hula</i>
all in Hawaiian,


604
00:38:40.772 --> 00:38:42.687
then you would have to join
a <i>halau.</i>


605
00:38:43.818 --> 00:38:46.386
Okay. I get it.

606
00:38:46.386 --> 00:38:47.822
When do we start?

607
00:38:53.611 --> 00:38:56.004
This is my <i>haole.</i>
Sorry for the mess.


608
00:38:56.004 --> 00:38:59.791
Are you kidding? 
It's beautiful!

609
00:38:59.791 --> 00:39:02.228
I know it's not much,
but you wanted private.


610
00:39:02.228 --> 00:39:04.317
Definitely won't be seen
by any of your coworkers here.


611
00:39:04.317 --> 00:39:06.711
Yeah, that's perfect. Thank you.

612
00:39:06.711 --> 00:39:09.017
Now, the thing
about <i>hula</i>


613
00:39:09.017 --> 00:39:12.368
is that its main purpose
is not to entertain.


614
00:39:12.368 --> 00:39:14.893
It's meant to perpetuate
and preserve the stories,


615
00:39:14.893 --> 00:39:18.331
culture, history and traditions
of Hawaii.


616
00:39:18.331 --> 00:39:20.420
<i>Hula</i> is the heartbeat
of the Hawaiian people,


617
00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:22.509
and so it must be protected.

618
00:39:22.509 --> 00:39:25.164
To know <i>hula</i> is to know Hawaii.

619
00:39:25.164 --> 00:39:28.820
- Right.
- Great. Let's get started.


620
00:39:28.820 --> 00:39:31.649
Let's start with the feet.
Take off your shoes.


621
00:39:35.304 --> 00:39:38.090
In <i>hula,</i>
we start with the feet up.


622
00:39:38.090 --> 00:39:42.268
It's our base, our foundation.
This is called <i>kaholo.</i>


623
00:39:42.268 --> 00:39:49.710
One, two, three, four.

624
00:39:49.710 --> 00:39:53.061
One, two, that's it,
three, four.


625
00:39:53.061 --> 00:39:59.372
One, two, three, four.

626
00:39:59.372 --> 00:40:02.592
One, two, three, four. Perfect.

627
00:40:02.592 --> 00:40:07.162
Let's try <i>hala.
Hala,</i> point right.


628
00:40:07.162 --> 00:40:09.730
Two, point left.

629
00:40:09.730 --> 00:40:14.169
To, yeah, right, two, left.

630
00:40:14.169 --> 00:40:19.044
Two, right. Two, left. Two.

631
00:40:19.044 --> 00:40:21.524
Okay. Now let's try the <i>ka'o.</i>

632
00:40:21.524 --> 00:40:26.747
<i>Ka'o</i> is the movement
of the hips from right to left.


633
00:40:26.747 --> 00:40:32.100
Right to left. 
Right to left.

634
00:40:32.100 --> 00:40:35.713
Right to left.

635
00:40:35.713 --> 00:40:38.628
Think of moving your hips
like a figure eight


636
00:40:38.628 --> 00:40:41.457
or an infinity sign.
Constant flow.


637
00:40:42.328 --> 00:40:45.897
Yeah, right, left.

638
00:40:45.897 --> 00:40:50.989
Right to left. Right, left.

639
00:40:50.989 --> 00:40:55.384
Right, left. Yeah. Right. Yeah.

640
00:41:02.609 --> 00:41:05.960
- Sis!
- Hi!


641
00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:08.484
- Okay, come, come, come.
- Hi!


642
00:41:08.484 --> 00:41:11.400
- Hello!
- Aunty!


643
00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:14.273
This is your Aunty Leah.

644
00:41:14.273 --> 00:41:17.232
Hello, Leilani, Kealoha,
it is so nice


645
00:41:17.232 --> 00:41:19.278
to finally meet you in person.

646
00:41:19.278 --> 00:41:21.236
Hey, Kealoha,
it's Leah, remember?


647
00:41:21.236 --> 00:41:22.890
Okay, look, look, look, look.

648
00:41:22.890 --> 00:41:25.197
You know who I'm talking about.

649
00:41:31.899 --> 00:41:34.206
There is something different
about you today, Leah.


650
00:41:34.206 --> 00:41:36.556
- Is there?
- Yeah.


651
00:41:36.556 --> 00:41:38.819
Maybe the island
is changing you, eh?


652
00:41:38.819 --> 00:41:40.995
Maybe I'm just really happy

653
00:41:40.995 --> 00:41:43.084
to finally be meeting
your beautiful family.


654
00:41:43.084 --> 00:41:45.130
As much as I wanna
take the credit,


655
00:41:45.130 --> 00:41:47.045
I-I noticed it
when you first got here.


656
00:41:48.481 --> 00:41:50.352
- You meet someone?
- No.


657
00:41:50.352 --> 00:41:52.572
No!

658
00:41:52.572 --> 00:41:56.054
- No, spill it.
- It's nothing.


659
00:41:56.054 --> 00:41:59.492
I started taking <i>hula</i> lessons.

660
00:41:59.492 --> 00:42:01.711
- I mean, I mean, not really.
- You what?


661
00:42:01.711 --> 00:42:05.324
It's just beginning stuff
with someone from the hotel.


662
00:42:05.324 --> 00:42:09.241
What kind of someone?
They... Can they even do that?


663
00:42:09.241 --> 00:42:12.418
I guess, to the extent
that we're learning, yes.


664
00:42:12.418 --> 00:42:14.246
Uh, he said he got permission
from his <i>kumu,</i>


665
00:42:14.246 --> 00:42:16.944
even though he's not part
of the <i>halau</i> anymore.


666
00:42:16.944 --> 00:42:18.859
Um, who is he?

667
00:42:18.859 --> 00:42:22.254
- The guy teaching me.
- I see.


668
00:42:22.254 --> 00:42:26.258
And this guy,
does he know what he's doing?


669
00:42:26.258 --> 00:42:28.347
I mean, it seems like it to me.

670
00:42:28.347 --> 00:42:31.567
Ah, imagine that.
My Leah, a little <i>hula</i> girl.


671
00:42:31.567 --> 00:42:33.613
Oh, shh!

672
00:42:33.613 --> 00:42:35.006
But I can't tell anyone because

673
00:42:35.006 --> 00:42:38.009
if my boss found out,
she would kill me.


674
00:42:38.009 --> 00:42:40.750
I don't think your boss
would be the only one opposed.


675
00:42:40.750 --> 00:42:44.319
- What do you mean?
- I'm just surprised.


676
00:42:44.319 --> 00:42:46.887
Usually <i>kumu hula</i>
have strict rules


677
00:42:46.887 --> 00:42:50.978
against teaching just anybody
<i>hula,</i> especially tourists.


678
00:42:50.978 --> 00:42:54.068
But every <i>halau</i> is different,
I guess.


679
00:42:54.068 --> 00:42:58.594
Well, he said it's outside of
<i>halau,</i> and he's not even in it,


680
00:42:58.594 --> 00:43:00.292
and he got
his <i>kumu's</i> blessing...


681
00:43:00.292 --> 00:43:02.555
I know,
I know it's unconventional,


682
00:43:02.555 --> 00:43:06.951
but for the first time
in a long time


683
00:43:06.951 --> 00:43:10.824
I'm feeling alive.

684
00:43:10.824 --> 00:43:13.218
I don't know. Hm.

685
00:43:14.393 --> 00:43:16.264
I believe it.

686
00:43:16.264 --> 00:43:19.137
I can see it, too.

687
00:43:19.137 --> 00:43:22.531
- Okay, all right.
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.


688
00:43:30.235 --> 00:43:34.848
Ah! Howdy, partner. How has
your, uh, work solo day been?


689
00:43:34.848 --> 00:43:38.721
- It was great. Yours?
- Great, great.


690
00:43:38.721 --> 00:43:41.420
Um, didn't see you
at the property today.


691
00:43:41.420 --> 00:43:44.075
- I must have missed you.
- Oh, I missed you, too.


692
00:43:44.075 --> 00:43:46.077
Well, where, uh,
where else have you been?


693
00:43:47.034 --> 00:43:48.166
Elsewhere.

694
00:43:50.733 --> 00:43:52.344
Well, would you care to join me?

695
00:43:52.344 --> 00:43:54.955
No, I have some work to do, actually.

696
00:43:54.955 --> 00:43:58.611
So I'm gonna head up. But enjoy
the rest of your night.


697
00:43:58.611 --> 00:44:01.744
It looks like it's gonna be
a beautiful sunset.


698
00:44:08.838 --> 00:44:12.320
And one, two, three, four.

699
00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:16.063
One, two, three, four.
Very good.


700
00:44:16.063 --> 00:44:19.980
Now let's stop and move on
to the next part, hands.


701
00:44:19.980 --> 00:44:23.679
This flowing movement
of the hands is called <i>mili.</i>


702
00:44:23.679 --> 00:44:24.942
Okay.

703
00:44:28.293 --> 00:44:29.468
Softer.

704
00:44:33.602 --> 00:44:37.911
Smooth. Soft, but strong.

705
00:44:37.911 --> 00:44:40.609
Delicate, but purposeful.

706
00:44:42.437 --> 00:44:43.612
Focus.

707
00:44:47.486 --> 00:44:50.576
Um, I don't know
if my hands move that way.


708
00:44:54.319 --> 00:44:56.364
- I have an idea.
- Okay.


709
00:45:03.676 --> 00:45:06.592
- What are we doing here?
- I'm gonna show you.


710
00:45:06.592 --> 00:45:08.420
- You see the waves?
- Yeah.


711
00:45:08.420 --> 00:45:11.466
See how they move in a powerful,
smooth, continual motion?


712
00:45:13.164 --> 00:45:15.470
That's how your hands
need to move.


713
00:45:15.470 --> 00:45:17.690
Let the island and nature
show you.


714
00:45:29.136 --> 00:45:30.268
Try it.

715
00:45:37.318 --> 00:45:41.148
It's not about them. It's about
you and <i>hula</i> and the island.


716
00:45:41.148 --> 00:45:42.236
Come on.

717
00:46:10.612 --> 00:46:11.613
Yeah.

718
00:46:24.365 --> 00:46:26.063
Why'd you do that?

719
00:46:26.063 --> 00:46:29.022
Oh, the trash? It's a habit.

720
00:46:29.022 --> 00:46:31.198
I always like to leave a place
better than I found it.


721
00:46:35.898 --> 00:46:37.596
That's actually a Hawaii rule.

722
00:46:37.596 --> 00:46:40.381
Leave the island
better than you found it.


723
00:46:40.381 --> 00:46:41.513
You're not too bad for a <i>haole.</i>

724
00:46:41.513 --> 00:46:43.471
- You know that?
- I'll take it.


725
00:46:43.471 --> 00:46:45.038
Your boyfriend,
on the other hand--


726
00:46:45.038 --> 00:46:47.127
What? I don't have a boyfriend.

727
00:46:47.127 --> 00:46:48.563
The guy you're always with.

728
00:46:50.826 --> 00:46:55.483
Michael? No.
Michael is not my boyfriend.


729
00:46:55.483 --> 00:46:57.006
Does he know that?

730
00:47:00.009 --> 00:47:02.011
You did good today.

731
00:47:02.011 --> 00:47:06.451
Thank you. But now I'm starving.
Can I take you to dinner?


732
00:47:06.451 --> 00:47:09.976
There's that place by the hotel
I've been meaning to try.


733
00:47:09.976 --> 00:47:13.458
- No. You don't wanna go there.
- I don't?


734
00:47:13.458 --> 00:47:15.764
Let me take you out
for some real kind of <i>grindz.</i>


735
00:47:31.345 --> 00:47:35.001
- This is delicious.
- Fully sustainable, too.


736
00:47:35.001 --> 00:47:37.177
Prawns are raised right here
on the land.


737
00:47:37.177 --> 00:47:39.614
You can see the pools
all around us.


738
00:47:39.614 --> 00:47:41.877
Yeah, that's something
you don't see in LA.


739
00:47:41.877 --> 00:47:43.618
Family has been here
for generations,


740
00:47:43.618 --> 00:47:45.533
as has this business.

741
00:47:45.533 --> 00:47:47.318
Right up the highway they have

742
00:47:47.318 --> 00:47:49.058
this fully-sustainable
fish pond


743
00:47:49.058 --> 00:47:50.886
maintained
by generations of volunteers


744
00:47:50.886 --> 00:47:52.975
providing resources
to the community.


745
00:47:52.975 --> 00:47:55.195
Wow! That's wonderful!

746
00:47:55.195 --> 00:47:57.980
We're very connected
to the land here.


747
00:47:57.980 --> 00:48:01.462
Hawaii is more
than beaches and mai tais.


748
00:48:01.462 --> 00:48:03.290
Though, those are
pretty great, too.


749
00:48:06.598 --> 00:48:08.600
You see that tree
right over there?


750
00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:10.297
- Yeah.
- I once knocked myself out.


751
00:48:10.297 --> 00:48:11.820
By running into it.

752
00:48:11.820 --> 00:48:13.431
- What?
- No, no joke.


753
00:48:13.431 --> 00:48:15.128
Me and my Cousin Billy
made a stupid bet


754
00:48:15.128 --> 00:48:18.218
over who can run the fastest,
so I ran so fast,


755
00:48:18.218 --> 00:48:20.307
and when I looked behind me
to see if Billy was catching up,


756
00:48:20.307 --> 00:48:22.657
I ran right into that tree
and knocked myself out.


757
00:48:22.657 --> 00:48:26.487
Right in front
of the whole <i>halau,</i> too.


758
00:48:26.487 --> 00:48:29.229
Come to think of it,
maybe that's when it was decided


759
00:48:29.229 --> 00:48:31.492
that being a <i>kumu</i>
wasn't in my future.


760
00:48:34.278 --> 00:48:37.716
<i>- Mahalo,</i> aunty.
- Aunty?


761
00:48:37.716 --> 00:48:39.283
Oh, everyone's aunty
and uncle here.


762
00:48:39.283 --> 00:48:41.720
Sign of respect and endearment.

763
00:48:41.720 --> 00:48:43.635
We're all one big <i>ohana, family.</i>

764
00:48:43.635 --> 00:48:45.245
I love that.

765
00:48:49.031 --> 00:48:52.121
- Do you ever regret it?
- Regret what?


766
00:48:52.121 --> 00:48:53.862
Not becoming a <i>kumu.</i>

767
00:48:56.169 --> 00:48:58.171
No.

768
00:48:58.171 --> 00:49:01.174
Why would I want such an honored
and respected role


769
00:49:01.174 --> 00:49:04.395
when I can easily teach tourists
the <i>Hukilau</i> at some hotel?


770
00:49:06.005 --> 00:49:09.530
No, but seriously,
I don't regret it.


771
00:49:09.530 --> 00:49:11.402
It was the best decision for me.

772
00:49:16.058 --> 00:49:17.886
What about you?

773
00:49:17.886 --> 00:49:21.194
- What about me?
- Would you change anything?


774
00:49:22.891 --> 00:49:24.719
Oh, I don't know.

775
00:49:24.719 --> 00:49:27.244
I don't even know what that
would look like, you know?


776
00:49:32.597 --> 00:49:35.252
I take that back.

777
00:49:35.252 --> 00:49:39.212
I wish I had told John
how much I actually loved him


778
00:49:39.212 --> 00:49:40.822
before it was too late.

779
00:49:46.219 --> 00:49:48.700
Sorry. I don't know
where that came from.


780
00:49:48.700 --> 00:49:51.398
Don't be sorry. Who's John?

781
00:49:54.532 --> 00:49:58.492
John was my first...

782
00:49:58.492 --> 00:50:02.409
Well, really, my only love.

783
00:50:02.409 --> 00:50:05.543
We met in college
and just clicked.


784
00:50:05.543 --> 00:50:08.546
Right after school I got
this incredible job offer


785
00:50:08.546 --> 00:50:13.464
on the other side of the country
and I left him for it.


786
00:50:13.464 --> 00:50:14.682
I broke his heart.

787
00:50:16.684 --> 00:50:20.558
A couple years of later
I realized how much I missed him


788
00:50:20.558 --> 00:50:24.997
and how much I messed up,
and I went to find him.


789
00:50:24.997 --> 00:50:26.694
But he had gotten married and

790
00:50:26.694 --> 00:50:29.393
was starting a family
with someone new.


791
00:50:29.393 --> 00:50:33.397
- I'm sorry.
- Ah. It was a long time ago.


792
00:50:33.397 --> 00:50:35.355
I dove fully back into work.

793
00:50:35.355 --> 00:50:38.837
And one day,
it stopped hurting so much.


794
00:50:40.099 --> 00:50:42.928
I kind of stopped feeling

795
00:50:42.928 --> 00:50:44.886
or doing anything
outside of my career.


796
00:50:44.886 --> 00:50:47.106
And it's been that way
ever since.


797
00:50:48.150 --> 00:50:52.807
So, really, this is

798
00:50:52.807 --> 00:50:54.896
kind of making a change for me.

799
00:50:54.896 --> 00:50:58.204
I mean, no part of me ever
thought that I would be here


800
00:50:58.204 --> 00:51:00.598
and learning <i>hula.</i>

801
00:51:00.598 --> 00:51:02.339
And hiding it from my work,
no less.


802
00:51:02.339 --> 00:51:05.559
So, thank you for helping me.

803
00:51:05.559 --> 00:51:07.735
Thank you for wanting to learn.

804
00:51:07.735 --> 00:51:09.650
Sorry
for the unexpected rambling.


805
00:51:09.650 --> 00:51:11.696
No, thank you
for trusting me with it.


806
00:51:15.613 --> 00:51:19.660
- To new horizons.
- And new friends.


807
00:51:19.660 --> 00:51:21.532
And getting to know
the real Hawaii.


808
00:51:26.188 --> 00:51:27.538
Oh, before I forget.

809
00:51:29.061 --> 00:51:31.368
- What's this?
- For the last two lessons.


810
00:51:31.368 --> 00:51:34.806
- Oh, no, I can't.
- What do you mean you can't?


811
00:51:34.806 --> 00:51:36.416
It's been my pleasure, Leah.

812
00:51:36.416 --> 00:51:38.462
Uh, you're reconnecting me
with my home and


813
00:51:38.462 --> 00:51:41.073
letting me experience it
through your eyes.


814
00:51:41.073 --> 00:51:42.857
That's more valuable to me.

815
00:51:44.076 --> 00:51:45.251
Thank you.

816
00:51:47.471 --> 00:51:49.342
Positioned right
on the crystal-blue coast


817
00:51:49.342 --> 00:51:51.997
and offering stunning views
of the magnificent mountains,


818
00:51:51.997 --> 00:51:55.696
this in-demand destination
could host upwards of 200 guests


819
00:51:55.696 --> 00:51:58.046
in its modest 60 rooms.

820
00:51:58.046 --> 00:52:00.701
If we level out the land,
this number could climb


821
00:52:00.701 --> 00:52:04.009
to 300 guests and 100 rooms.

822
00:52:11.277 --> 00:52:14.062
Or it could sustain
generations and generations


823
00:52:14.062 --> 00:52:16.848
of a family and community.

824
00:52:34.561 --> 00:52:36.520
Getting to know you, indeed.

825
00:53:04.896 --> 00:53:06.985
All of our songs
we dance to,


826
00:53:06.985 --> 00:53:09.553
these are all stories
of the island.


827
00:53:09.553 --> 00:53:12.860
But to really dance the mele,
a song,


828
00:53:12.860 --> 00:53:16.603
you must really feel the <i>kaona,</i>
the hidden meaning.


829
00:53:16.603 --> 00:53:20.433
Understanding the island
might help you get there.


830
00:53:20.433 --> 00:53:23.741
This is one of our most historic
fish ponds.


831
00:53:23.741 --> 00:53:26.613
- Breathtaking.
- Yeah.


832
00:53:26.613 --> 00:53:29.964
Volunteers from the community
help maintain it,


833
00:53:29.964 --> 00:53:32.053
and the resources from the pond
in turn


834
00:53:32.053 --> 00:53:33.881
help sustain the community.

835
00:53:36.971 --> 00:53:39.147
I grew up coming here
and working the ponds.


836
00:53:40.322 --> 00:53:41.541
That's amazing.

837
00:53:41.541 --> 00:53:43.108
One of the few places
on the island


838
00:53:43.108 --> 00:53:45.327
as yet untouched by developers.

839
00:53:50.463 --> 00:53:52.857
I wanna build
something like this one day.


840
00:53:52.857 --> 00:53:54.293
I try to come back
every now and then,


841
00:53:54.293 --> 00:53:57.252
but it would be
great to leave the hotel job


842
00:53:57.252 --> 00:53:59.298
and do something like this
full-time.


843
00:54:01.343 --> 00:54:03.520
- What is it?
- No, nothing.


844
00:54:03.520 --> 00:54:05.870
No. What?

845
00:54:05.870 --> 00:54:08.525
You're just really unexpected, Ikaika.

846
00:54:08.525 --> 00:54:09.830
I mean, listening to you
talk about


847
00:54:09.830 --> 00:54:12.180
all these things
you wanna build,


848
00:54:12.180 --> 00:54:15.488
I'm reminded that I used
to wanna build similar things.


849
00:54:15.488 --> 00:54:18.665
And, I don't know,
life got in the way


850
00:54:18.665 --> 00:54:22.016
and I-I forgot
that I wanted those things.


851
00:54:23.496 --> 00:54:25.498
It's never too late to remember.

852
00:54:27.021 --> 00:54:29.241
No. I guess not.

853
00:56:26.706 --> 00:56:28.142
<i>- Pua.
- Pua.</i>


854
00:57:23.981 --> 00:57:26.592
You're getting so close,
I think just maybe


855
00:57:26.592 --> 00:57:28.768
you're missing the <i>kaona,</i>
the hidden meaning of the song.


856
00:57:28.768 --> 00:57:30.030
It'll come.
It'll just take time.


857
00:57:30.030 --> 00:57:31.466
But you already told me
what it means.


858
00:57:31.466 --> 00:57:33.817
Uh, this hidden meaning
I can't tell you.


859
00:57:33.817 --> 00:57:37.168
You'll have to discover it
for yourself.


860
00:57:37.168 --> 00:57:39.779
Let's head back. I gotta do
hotel activities in an hour.


861
00:57:39.779 --> 00:57:41.085
Okay.

862
00:57:47.787 --> 00:57:49.963
I think you dropped this, aunty.

863
00:57:53.924 --> 00:57:56.317
- Beautiful.
<i>- Mahalo.</i>


864
00:58:06.284 --> 00:58:08.286
- Everything okay?
- You made an impression.


865
00:58:08.286 --> 00:58:10.418
- With that <i>kupuna.
- Kupuna?</i>


866
00:58:10.418 --> 00:58:13.204
Ah, it's a name
for our respected elders.


867
00:58:13.204 --> 00:58:15.859
How did you know which side
to put the flower on?


868
00:58:15.859 --> 00:58:19.471
Oh, um, it just seemed right.

869
00:58:19.471 --> 00:58:21.821
Or maybe you've been paying more
attention than you've realized.


870
00:58:27.479 --> 00:58:31.135
For tomorrow's lesson,
I wanna give you something.


871
00:58:31.135 --> 00:58:33.354
Let's meet at our regular
beach spot after work?


872
00:58:33.354 --> 00:58:34.486
It's a date.

873
00:58:54.680 --> 00:58:55.812
Hello.

874
00:58:57.204 --> 00:58:58.684
Hi.

875
00:58:58.684 --> 00:59:00.555
What was that? 
It was beautiful.

876
00:59:04.472 --> 00:59:07.867
A chant.
Putting the sun to sleep.


877
00:59:07.867 --> 00:59:10.652
Been a long time
since I felt called to do that.


878
00:59:10.652 --> 00:59:14.482
You've been reminding me.
Well, reminding me a lot lately.


879
00:59:17.311 --> 00:59:19.357
I've made a career

880
00:59:19.357 --> 00:59:22.664
out of creating spaces
all over the world.


881
00:59:23.578 --> 00:59:25.711
I have never met anyone

882
00:59:25.711 --> 00:59:28.279
with as much reverence
for a place as you.


883
00:59:28.279 --> 00:59:29.889
I'm far from being
an example of that,


884
00:59:29.889 --> 00:59:31.369
as my mother loves to remind me.

885
00:59:31.369 --> 00:59:33.980
No, everything that I've seen
since I met you


886
00:59:33.980 --> 00:59:37.375
has shown that you really care.

887
00:59:38.506 --> 00:59:42.162
You really love this island,

888
00:59:42.162 --> 00:59:44.643
and making me
fall in love with it, too.


889
00:59:44.643 --> 00:59:46.688
Which is crazy because I thought

890
00:59:46.688 --> 00:59:50.779
I was perfectly content
back home.


891
00:59:50.779 --> 00:59:55.480
But being here, spending time
with you and with the island...


892
00:59:58.352 --> 01:00:03.053
I think
that I'm maybe seeing that...


893
01:00:05.577 --> 01:00:10.625
I didn't know
that I could feel more again.


894
01:00:13.759 --> 01:00:15.369
And maybe that's why
I'm frustrated when you say


895
01:00:15.369 --> 01:00:16.980
that I still don't get
the hidden meaning,


896
01:00:16.980 --> 01:00:18.807
because, truthfully, I'm feeling

897
01:00:18.807 --> 01:00:22.768
more than I have
in a very long time.


898
01:00:22.768 --> 01:00:25.597
You'll understand the <i>kaona</i>
someday, don't worry.


899
01:00:27.904 --> 01:00:29.949
You know what the <i>kupuna</i>
said to me yesterday?


900
01:00:29.949 --> 01:00:31.951
- The one you gave the <i>pua</i> to?
- What?


901
01:00:31.951 --> 01:00:34.040
She said
she could sense your spirit.


902
01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:36.695
And she responded
very favorably to you.


903
01:00:36.695 --> 01:00:39.959
That's no small praise
coming from a <i>kupuna</i> like her.


904
01:00:39.959 --> 01:00:41.700
You also knew which side
to put the <i>pua</i> on,


905
01:00:41.700 --> 01:00:43.963
and I'd never told you that.

906
01:00:43.963 --> 01:00:46.923
That was a lucky guess.
I-I didn't know it mattered.


907
01:00:46.923 --> 01:00:51.144
But you did. You're wearing
yours on the other side, too.


908
01:00:51.144 --> 01:00:53.755
It's like you know
without knowing. It's natural.


909
01:00:56.149 --> 01:01:00.284
She's right, you know?
There is something about you.


910
01:01:00.284 --> 01:01:02.851
My mother is a <i>kumu hula,</i> and
for the longest time I thought


911
01:01:02.851 --> 01:01:04.636
that's what I was going to be.

912
01:01:04.636 --> 01:01:07.639
But things became
a little strained.


913
01:01:07.639 --> 01:01:11.295
My father... Are you ready
for it? Was a <i>haole.</i>


914
01:01:11.295 --> 01:01:13.471
He also wasn't a good one
at that.


915
01:01:13.471 --> 01:01:15.299
He made some unwise investments,

916
01:01:15.299 --> 01:01:17.388
got in a little
financial trouble.


917
01:01:17.388 --> 01:01:20.565
Then one day he just
up and left. Never came back.


918
01:01:20.565 --> 01:01:23.220
She never really got over that.

919
01:01:23.220 --> 01:01:25.526
Ikaika, that's terrible.

920
01:01:25.526 --> 01:01:27.615
He passed away when I was young.

921
01:01:27.615 --> 01:01:29.095
My mom did her best
to bounce back,


922
01:01:29.095 --> 01:01:31.576
but I think
I reminded her of him.


923
01:01:33.186 --> 01:01:35.580
I'm glad my mother has
the <i>halau.</i>


924
01:01:35.580 --> 01:01:38.800
I'm realizing
that my mother's real love,


925
01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:41.325
her real child was the <i>halau,</i>

926
01:01:41.325 --> 01:01:43.370
and I'll never be
good enough for it.


927
01:01:44.502 --> 01:01:46.417
I'm sure that's not true.

928
01:01:47.548 --> 01:01:49.507
I tried for years.

929
01:01:49.507 --> 01:01:52.162
I even chose the <i>halau</i>
over what I wanted to build.


930
01:01:52.162 --> 01:01:55.165
Invested in that instead
of the ponds I wanted to create.


931
01:01:55.165 --> 01:01:56.905
And I think part of her
wanted to trust me,


932
01:01:56.905 --> 01:01:59.517
but there was always
that part, too, that worried her


933
01:01:59.517 --> 01:02:01.693
that I would turn out
to be like my father.


934
01:02:02.911 --> 01:02:05.001
I'm so sorry.

935
01:02:05.001 --> 01:02:08.656
It's okay,
I've made peace with that.


936
01:02:08.656 --> 01:02:11.572
And now she's in this place
where she might lose the <i>halau,</i>


937
01:02:11.572 --> 01:02:13.270
or at least the property its on.

938
01:02:13.270 --> 01:02:15.968
So she's come back into my life

939
01:02:15.968 --> 01:02:17.883
to ask me to somehow save it.

940
01:02:21.495 --> 01:02:24.194
She made me
fall out of love with <i>hula.</i>


941
01:02:24.194 --> 01:02:27.806
But... here you come,

942
01:02:27.806 --> 01:02:32.202
all of a sudden, out of nowhere,
a <i>haole,</i> no less,


943
01:02:32.202 --> 01:02:34.813
you're the one making me
fall back in love with it again.


944
01:02:47.391 --> 01:02:49.219
I am so sorry.

945
01:02:49.219 --> 01:02:50.742
No, it's okay.

946
01:02:50.742 --> 01:02:52.831
I'm supposed to be your teacher.
I can't--


947
01:02:52.831 --> 01:02:57.270
Ikaika... I understand.

948
01:03:04.538 --> 01:03:08.934
Oh, I almost forgot.
I brought something for you.


949
01:03:08.934 --> 01:03:12.024
I think you're ready
for the next step.


950
01:03:12.024 --> 01:03:14.983
Normally in a <i>halau,</i>
this would be made for you.


951
01:03:14.983 --> 01:03:17.856
But seeing as our situation
is a little unique,


952
01:03:17.856 --> 01:03:20.685
I figured you can borrow
my old one.


953
01:03:20.685 --> 01:03:23.166
It's one of my old <i>pa'u</i> skirts
from when I was a <i>keiki.</i>


954
01:03:23.166 --> 01:03:26.430
Now you can really work on your
dance like a real <i>haumana</i> would.


955
01:03:26.430 --> 01:03:29.215
It's beautiful! Thank you.

956
01:03:29.215 --> 01:03:32.262
Bring it to our next lesson.
You're ready.


957
01:03:53.109 --> 01:03:56.808
- Oh, <i>aloha!</i> Mrs. Ka-Ka-Kama--
- Not today.


958
01:03:56.808 --> 01:03:59.637
- I was just wondering if I cou--
- Aunty, aunty.


959
01:03:59.637 --> 01:04:02.248
I'll talk to Ikaika,
i-it's gonna be okay.


960
01:04:02.248 --> 01:04:05.991
Ikaika isn't gonna do anything.
It's too late.


961
01:04:09.255 --> 01:04:12.345
- Did you say "Ikaika?"
- Oh. Who are you, brah?


962
01:04:22.181 --> 01:04:24.183
Well, well, well. 
If it isn't...

963
01:04:24.183 --> 01:04:25.967
Wait, I'm sorry,
what is your name again?


964
01:04:25.967 --> 01:04:27.186
It's been so long since
I've seen


965
01:04:27.186 --> 01:04:28.753
you last,
I've completely forgot.


966
01:04:28.753 --> 01:04:30.972
It's been less than a week,
Michael. Calm down.


967
01:04:30.972 --> 01:04:33.627
I, uh, paid a little visit
to the property again yesterday.


968
01:04:33.627 --> 01:04:35.847
You do know you're supposed to
be gaining the family's trust.


969
01:04:35.847 --> 01:04:37.370
- Not bullying them, right?
- And I learned...


970
01:04:37.370 --> 01:04:39.764
Some pretty fascinating information.

971
01:04:39.764 --> 01:04:42.201
- I bet you did.
- I gotta hand it to you, Leah.


972
01:04:42.201 --> 01:04:45.117
I'm impressed
there is a shark in you yet.


973
01:04:45.117 --> 01:04:47.163
- What are you talking about?
- This little <i>hula</i> guy...


974
01:04:47.163 --> 01:04:48.773
That you've been sneaking off
with, at first I thought


975
01:04:48.773 --> 01:04:49.991
you were just getting, you know,

976
01:04:49.991 --> 01:04:51.863
a little friendly
with the locals.


977
01:04:51.863 --> 01:04:54.996
No judgement here. Then I
found out who he really was.


978
01:04:54.996 --> 01:04:56.781
- Can ya make your point already?
- I realized...


979
01:04:56.781 --> 01:05:01.220
That this nice-girl play of
yours is just an act. Well done.


980
01:05:01.220 --> 01:05:02.569
Michael, I don't know
what you're talking--


981
01:05:02.569 --> 01:05:04.267
Oh, I think you do
and I figured out


982
01:05:04.267 --> 01:05:06.312
your little secret.
I'm on to you.


983
01:05:08.662 --> 01:05:10.577
- What? I don't--
- I, uh, uh--


984
01:05:14.277 --> 01:05:17.062
I have a meeting to get
to. I will talk to you later.


985
01:05:17.062 --> 01:05:19.064
Hope it's a good meeting.

986
01:05:19.064 --> 01:05:21.849
Your back was turned, but...
I used air quotes.


987
01:05:27.855 --> 01:05:29.857
Oh, actually,

988
01:05:29.857 --> 01:05:33.731
we are going to put this top.

989
01:05:33.731 --> 01:05:38.344
There you go, now let's see
if it covers your knees.


990
01:05:38.344 --> 01:05:43.088
Hm, just barely. But I think
for our purpose, this will do.


991
01:05:43.088 --> 01:05:44.655
Thank you.

992
01:05:44.655 --> 01:05:47.571
Are you ready for the lessons
to really begin?


993
01:05:47.571 --> 01:05:51.618
What are you doing with that?
You.


994
01:05:51.618 --> 01:05:54.142
This is the <i>haole</i> girl
that you wanna teach?


995
01:05:54.142 --> 01:05:56.971
- We talked about this.
- You gave her your <i>pa'u</i> skirt?


996
01:05:56.971 --> 01:05:58.364
It's just for the lesson--

997
01:05:58.364 --> 01:06:00.410
We said tourist <i>hapa haole</i> only.

998
01:06:00.410 --> 01:06:03.326
You shouldn't give it away.
She has no need for a <i>pa'u!</i>


999
01:06:03.326 --> 01:06:05.371
I didn't give it away.
I thought--


1000
01:06:05.371 --> 01:06:06.764
Oh, you thought, did you?

1001
01:06:06.764 --> 01:06:09.201
Because it doesn't look like it
to me.


1002
01:06:09.201 --> 01:06:11.682
She's not <i>haumana</i>
and you're not a <i>kumu.</i>


1003
01:06:11.682 --> 01:06:13.379
- She's a swindling--
- That's enough.


1004
01:06:17.383 --> 01:06:19.994
I'm sorry,
but you shouldn't call her that.


1005
01:06:19.994 --> 01:06:22.649
Quiet, I want you
and all your villains


1006
01:06:22.649 --> 01:06:24.260
to stay away from my son.

1007
01:06:24.260 --> 01:06:26.174
- Mom.
- Your son?


1008
01:06:26.174 --> 01:06:28.960
Do you know what your kind
is doing to me and my family?


1009
01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:30.353
Ikaika, can I talk to you
for a moment?


1010
01:06:30.353 --> 01:06:32.311
- No, you cannot.
- But, aunty, I can explain.


1011
01:06:32.311 --> 01:06:34.357
- What did you call me?
- I'm sorry.


1012
01:06:34.357 --> 01:06:37.969
I am <i>Kumu</i> Kamalani,
and no aunty of yours.


1013
01:06:37.969 --> 01:06:40.363
Now take off that skirt,
and don't come back.


1014
01:06:44.976 --> 01:06:49.372
I'm so sorry, <i>Kumu</i> Kamalani.
I'm so sorry, Ikaika.


1015
01:07:03.908 --> 01:07:05.344
- Back so soon.
- Not now, Michael.


1016
01:07:05.344 --> 01:07:07.128
You know what
I was talking about earlier?


1017
01:07:07.128 --> 01:07:09.479
About how impressed I was with
your, we'll call it, work?


1018
01:07:09.479 --> 01:07:11.916
- Well, Diana agrees with me.
- What did you tell her?


1019
01:07:11.916 --> 01:07:15.963
Just the truth. In fact,
she was so impressed that... Ah.


1020
01:07:15.963 --> 01:07:17.704
Diana, hello!

1021
01:07:17.704 --> 01:07:20.098
- Or should I say <i>aloha?</i>
- Diana?


1022
01:07:20.098 --> 01:07:23.101
Is anyone else struggling
to breathe in this humidity?


1023
01:07:23.101 --> 01:07:24.755
I didn't know you were coming.

1024
01:07:24.755 --> 01:07:27.018
Oh, really?
Michael said he told you.


1025
01:07:27.018 --> 01:07:29.020
I did, didn't I?
Oh, I thought I did.


1026
01:07:29.020 --> 01:07:32.197
She's been so busy lately, I'm
sure it just slipped her mind.


1027
01:07:32.197 --> 01:07:34.373
Michael has been telling
me about your tactics with


1028
01:07:34.373 --> 01:07:37.289
the family, and I have to say,
I was starting to worry


1029
01:07:37.289 --> 01:07:38.899
about your ability
to pull this off,


1030
01:07:38.899 --> 01:07:42.642
especially after Michael told me
about your dancing.


1031
01:07:42.642 --> 01:07:44.383
But now that I see
what you're up to,


1032
01:07:44.383 --> 01:07:48.735
I'm sorry I ever questioned your
ability to attack like a shark.


1033
01:07:48.735 --> 01:07:50.433
That is exactly what I said.

1034
01:07:50.433 --> 01:07:52.652
I mean, chumming it up
with that <i>hula</i> guy


1035
01:07:52.652 --> 01:07:54.915
so you can get close to him
and the family


1036
01:07:54.915 --> 01:07:57.875
and then convince them
to surrender the buyout to you.


1037
01:07:57.875 --> 01:08:00.747
- I... Ah. Genius!
- What?


1038
01:08:00.747 --> 01:08:02.967
At first I thought, what could
you possibly see in this guy.


1039
01:08:02.967 --> 01:08:05.578
Right, and then just yesterday,
and I'm talking to his cousin


1040
01:08:05.578 --> 01:08:08.407
and I learned that he is
the heir of the property,


1041
01:08:08.407 --> 01:08:09.756
and thus the decision-maker

1042
01:08:09.756 --> 01:08:12.019
that we're all here
trying to impress.


1043
01:08:14.457 --> 01:08:18.112
- Ikaika, wait.
- Ooh. Is that him?


1044
01:08:18.112 --> 01:08:19.766
Oh, maybe you don't have this
as quite in the bag


1045
01:08:19.766 --> 01:08:21.551
as you thought.

1046
01:08:21.551 --> 01:08:22.943
How could you?

1047
01:08:27.731 --> 01:08:31.648
- Ikaika. No, I did--
- You have some nerve.


1048
01:08:31.648 --> 01:08:34.041
You know, I thought
something was a little strange.


1049
01:08:34.041 --> 01:08:37.871
Why would a rich hotel guest who
keeps such unpleasant company


1050
01:08:37.871 --> 01:08:39.873
want to spend any time
learning about the island


1051
01:08:39.873 --> 01:08:42.920
and our traditions and why would
she wanna make it a secret?


1052
01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:45.052
- It's all coming together now.
- That isn't what happened.


1053
01:08:45.052 --> 01:08:46.750
- It isn't?
- No.


1054
01:08:46.750 --> 01:08:49.709
Because it looks like
that is exactly what happened.


1055
01:08:49.709 --> 01:08:51.494
When my mother told me,
I didn't wanna


1056
01:08:51.494 --> 01:08:53.147
believe her,
but your colleagues


1057
01:08:53.147 --> 01:08:55.280
really cleared that up for me.
So thank you.


1058
01:08:55.280 --> 01:08:57.108
I didn't know that you were
related at all to the property.


1059
01:08:57.108 --> 01:09:00.241
- I swear.
- Are you even hearing yourself?


1060
01:09:00.241 --> 01:09:05.072
I told you
my mother was the <i>kumu hula</i>


1061
01:09:05.072 --> 01:09:08.336
and that her <i>halau</i> is in danger.

1062
01:09:08.336 --> 01:09:10.426
But the <i>halau</i>
is on the property site?


1063
01:09:10.426 --> 01:09:12.863
Stop with what
you're playing at!


1064
01:09:12.863 --> 01:09:16.214
She saw you there.
That is where you met.


1065
01:09:16.214 --> 01:09:18.085
Yes, but I-I didn't know
who she was at the time.


1066
01:09:18.085 --> 01:09:19.609
And-and I didn't know
the <i>halau--</i>


1067
01:09:19.609 --> 01:09:22.829
The land is currently
under my name.


1068
01:09:22.829 --> 01:09:24.222
No, the property
is under the name--


1069
01:09:24.222 --> 01:09:26.180
Robert!

1070
01:09:26.180 --> 01:09:30.533
My American name is Robert,
like my father.


1071
01:09:30.533 --> 01:09:33.492
When he passed, the property
was bequeathed to me.


1072
01:09:33.492 --> 01:09:35.973
That is how the <i>halau</i>
is still there.


1073
01:09:35.973 --> 01:09:37.670
And now I'm going to lose it.

1074
01:09:37.670 --> 01:09:39.803
After all these generations,

1075
01:09:39.803 --> 01:09:43.154
I'm the one to lose everything.

1076
01:09:44.895 --> 01:09:46.287
My mother was right.

1077
01:09:47.375 --> 01:09:50.509
Never trust a <i>haole.</i>

1078
01:09:50.509 --> 01:09:52.946
Don't bother putting your name
on the auction tomorrow.


1079
01:12:43.377 --> 01:12:45.989
Good job, everyone.
I'll see you all next week.


1080
01:12:50.297 --> 01:12:52.169
I wasn't expecting
to see you yet.


1081
01:12:52.169 --> 01:12:54.693
- It's the auction.
- I heard.


1082
01:12:54.693 --> 01:12:57.391
And I have something
to show you.


1083
01:12:58.958 --> 01:13:00.133
Coming.

1084
01:13:03.746 --> 01:13:06.009
- Diana?
- The auction is off.


1085
01:13:06.009 --> 01:13:07.663
- What?
- The property!


1086
01:13:07.663 --> 01:13:09.360
I just heard the news.

1087
01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:12.189
The family's attorney got
a check from an anonymous donor


1088
01:13:12.189 --> 01:13:14.321
who paid the lien just in time
to pull it from the auction.


1089
01:13:14.321 --> 01:13:15.932
But-but... That's... How-how?

1090
01:13:15.932 --> 01:13:18.586
How on earth did they come up
with this kind of money?


1091
01:13:18.586 --> 01:13:20.545
I've been trying to get
a hold of Leah, too,


1092
01:13:20.545 --> 01:13:22.025
but she's not in her room and...

1093
01:13:38.302 --> 01:13:39.607
What's this?

1094
01:13:39.607 --> 01:13:42.045
Just a little
goodbye-for-now gift.


1095
01:13:42.045 --> 01:13:45.004
Some snacks
for the kiddos and you.


1096
01:13:45.004 --> 01:13:48.704
Thank you.
Do you really have to go back?


1097
01:13:50.793 --> 01:13:53.796
I do. Yeah.

1098
01:13:53.796 --> 01:13:57.364
- But, uh...
- But what?


1099
01:13:57.364 --> 01:14:00.150
All I've done is make a mess
of things since I got here.


1100
01:14:00.150 --> 01:14:04.154
You were supposed to convert
to an island girl with me.


1101
01:14:04.154 --> 01:14:08.767
I ruined that fantasy too badly
for repair, I think.


1102
01:14:08.767 --> 01:14:11.770
But maybe one day,

1103
01:14:11.770 --> 01:14:16.470
after I have some time
to heal, I...


1104
01:14:17.820 --> 01:14:19.778
I'll come back and visit.

1105
01:14:19.778 --> 01:14:21.519
Oh, just come on.

1106
01:14:23.956 --> 01:14:26.654
Aw...

1107
01:14:26.654 --> 01:14:29.570
- I'm sorry, Leah.
- Don't be.


1108
01:14:29.570 --> 01:14:32.138
I learned that I...

1109
01:14:33.574 --> 01:14:35.751
Well, I learned
that I can really love.


1110
01:14:37.709 --> 01:14:41.408
I can feel exhilarated
and feel butterflies


1111
01:14:41.408 --> 01:14:44.847
and all those crazy things
I never thought I'd feel again.


1112
01:14:44.847 --> 01:14:46.805
And if the downside of that

1113
01:14:46.805 --> 01:14:50.069
is that I also have to feel
the pain of loss,


1114
01:14:50.069 --> 01:14:53.029
well, then I have
to deal with that.


1115
01:14:54.465 --> 01:14:57.076
At least I can feel.

1116
01:14:57.076 --> 01:14:58.730
And that's something
I didn't know I could do again


1117
01:14:58.730 --> 01:15:00.123
before I got here.

1118
01:15:02.212 --> 01:15:05.345
You sure you can't just
try talking to him?


1119
01:15:09.088 --> 01:15:11.961
Thank you for still loving me.

1120
01:15:11.961 --> 01:15:14.833
And thank you for always knowing
when to check in.


1121
01:15:14.833 --> 01:15:16.661
I real... I don't thank you
enough for that.


1122
01:15:16.661 --> 01:15:20.186
Oh, no thanks necessary.
Get in here. Oh!


1123
01:15:31.154 --> 01:15:34.200
This came in
from the attorney, too.


1124
01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:35.549
Why didn't you
tell me that you had


1125
01:15:35.549 --> 01:15:38.161
a business plan for the land?

1126
01:15:38.161 --> 01:15:41.642
- How?
- This is wonderful, Ikaika.


1127
01:15:41.642 --> 01:15:43.688
And the attorney said
that there's an anonymous


1128
01:15:43.688 --> 01:15:47.387
investment check
that will cover the development.


1129
01:15:47.387 --> 01:15:50.434
Looks like someone else
out there believes in it, too.


1130
01:15:59.617 --> 01:16:01.314
Diana?

1131
01:16:01.314 --> 01:16:04.578
- Why did you do it?
- Do what?


1132
01:16:04.578 --> 01:16:08.321
The anonymous check the family
suddenly got to cover the lien.


1133
01:16:08.321 --> 01:16:09.583
I know it was you.

1134
01:16:11.498 --> 01:16:14.023
You know I'm gonna have to ask
for your resignation letter.


1135
01:16:14.023 --> 01:16:15.633
Already submitted.

1136
01:16:19.855 --> 01:16:20.943
Leah.

1137
01:16:22.770 --> 01:16:26.470
Please, I just wanna understand.

1138
01:16:29.038 --> 01:16:33.129
I just knew in my heart
it was the right thing to do.


1139
01:16:33.129 --> 01:16:35.827
But giving up everything you've
worked for this whole time


1140
01:16:35.827 --> 01:16:39.352
at Livvana?
Uh, and giving up partner?


1141
01:16:39.352 --> 01:16:41.572
You know I have to give it
to Michael now.


1142
01:16:41.572 --> 01:16:43.922
And not to mention
however much you paid


1143
01:16:43.922 --> 01:16:46.272
to cover that lien.

1144
01:16:46.272 --> 01:16:48.927
Well, what I invested is small

1145
01:16:48.927 --> 01:16:50.886
compared to what you and
the Prescotts would have made


1146
01:16:50.886 --> 01:16:54.324
from displacing the family
that owns that land


1147
01:16:54.324 --> 01:16:55.934
and that runs
the community center.


1148
01:16:55.934 --> 01:16:59.720
And it's small compared
to what we've made at Livvana


1149
01:16:59.720 --> 01:17:02.201
doing that
countless times before.


1150
01:17:04.725 --> 01:17:06.423
I hope it was worth it.

1151
01:17:07.293 --> 01:17:08.904
I know that it is.

1152
01:17:20.698 --> 01:17:22.439
Diana, I
-I need you to know

1153
01:17:22.439 --> 01:17:26.312
that this has nothing to do
with you.


1154
01:17:26.312 --> 01:17:30.838
This is about me, mm,
finally following my heart


1155
01:17:30.838 --> 01:17:33.841
that feels something for the
first time in a very long time.


1156
01:17:35.843 --> 01:17:40.413
You will always be the greatest
mentor I have ever had.


1157
01:17:40.413 --> 01:17:41.937
Thank you for that.

1158
01:17:45.114 --> 01:17:47.290
What am I gonna do without you?

1159
01:17:47.290 --> 01:17:51.990
Ah, well, I might be penniless
and looking for work soon.


1160
01:17:51.990 --> 01:17:53.513
I don't know if you're heard,
but I just blew


1161
01:17:53.513 --> 01:17:55.124
my savings on a whim investment.

1162
01:17:55.124 --> 01:17:56.952
Well, don't tease me.

1163
01:17:59.911 --> 01:18:03.132
Maybe take a little time
while you're here


1164
01:18:03.132 --> 01:18:05.917
and experience it.

1165
01:18:07.092 --> 01:18:08.876
It might change your life.

1166
01:18:09.921 --> 01:18:11.357
Did for me.

1167
01:18:26.633 --> 01:18:29.549
- Good luck.
- Thank you.


1168
01:18:45.478 --> 01:18:46.653
Hey, <i>haole!</i>

1169
01:19:08.806 --> 01:19:10.416
Billy said you needed these.

1170
01:19:10.416 --> 01:19:11.548
<i>Mahalo.</i>

1171
01:19:15.073 --> 01:19:17.945
- I'm sorry, Ikaika.
- For what?


1172
01:19:17.945 --> 01:19:19.947
For all the things
that I said to you


1173
01:19:19.947 --> 01:19:22.559
and for arguing with you
on your instincts.


1174
01:19:22.559 --> 01:19:24.648
Well, you were right
about doubting those.


1175
01:19:24.648 --> 01:19:27.564
No, I was very wrong.

1176
01:19:27.564 --> 01:19:29.174
And I'm sorry
for making you feel that


1177
01:19:29.174 --> 01:19:32.438
I could possibly love
anything more than you.


1178
01:19:32.438 --> 01:19:34.266
You're my son,

1179
01:19:34.266 --> 01:19:37.878
and I couldn't be more proud
of the man you've become.


1180
01:19:37.878 --> 01:19:41.012
You have a good head
and you have a good heart.


1181
01:19:41.012 --> 01:19:43.188
And you could see the truth
and the spirit in people


1182
01:19:43.188 --> 01:19:46.278
that I was too angry to see.

1183
01:19:46.278 --> 01:19:49.455
You honor me, Ikaika,
and I love you.


1184
01:19:56.636 --> 01:20:00.075
I better get in there. Class is
about to begin in a few minutes.


1185
01:20:00.075 --> 01:20:03.034
And we have a new <i>haumana</i>
joining our <i>ohana.</i>


1186
01:20:03.034 --> 01:20:05.689
- Someone new?
- Wanna come welcome 'em with me?


1187
01:20:17.527 --> 01:20:22.227
Ikaika, this is our <i>halau's</i>
new <i>haumana.</i>


1188
01:20:22.227 --> 01:20:24.838
Like I said, you were right
and I was wrong.


1189
01:20:26.013 --> 01:20:27.754
I went to the beach last night

1190
01:20:27.754 --> 01:20:30.061
to pray to our <i>kupuna</i>
for guidance.


1191
01:20:30.061 --> 01:20:32.194
And while I was there,
so was Leah.


1192
01:20:32.194 --> 01:20:35.588
She was dancing all alone,
and she made me feel something.


1193
01:20:35.588 --> 01:20:38.765
She danced from her <i>na'au.</i>
You taught her that.


1194
01:20:39.940 --> 01:20:41.159
And you taught her well.

1195
01:20:41.159 --> 01:20:43.161
Rumor on
the street is she just invested


1196
01:20:43.161 --> 01:20:45.816
in a very promising
local business.


1197
01:20:45.816 --> 01:20:49.124
Apparently, she did
the development plans, too.


1198
01:20:50.908 --> 01:20:54.216
Seems like we can use a partner
like her, don't you think?


1199
01:20:54.216 --> 01:20:55.478
Yeah.

1200
01:21:01.658 --> 01:21:04.791
- Hey, you did so good out--
- Thank you. I was so nervous.


1201
01:21:04.791 --> 01:21:07.490
Oh, don't be.
We'll see you next time.


1202
01:21:07.490 --> 01:21:08.534
Bye.

1203
01:21:13.148 --> 01:21:15.802
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.


1204
01:21:15.802 --> 01:21:18.805
I was just as surprised
as you probably were.


1205
01:21:21.068 --> 01:21:23.549
<i>Kumu</i> said she saw you dance
the mele on the beach.


1206
01:21:23.549 --> 01:21:26.509
Must have found the <i>kaona</i>
if it moved her.


1207
01:21:26.509 --> 01:21:29.294
Yeah, I, I think I did.

1208
01:21:31.775 --> 01:21:34.604
You see, I kind of messed up

1209
01:21:34.604 --> 01:21:37.737
with this really great guy.

1210
01:21:39.086 --> 01:21:40.740
Ah, we had this whole misunderstanding

1211
01:21:40.740 --> 01:21:43.221
and we both said
some hurtful things.


1212
01:21:43.221 --> 01:21:45.658
- Yeah, ouch.
- Yeah.


1213
01:21:45.658 --> 01:21:48.966
And it's really a bummer because...

1214
01:21:52.187 --> 01:21:55.015
I think I might actually
have feelings for this guy.


1215
01:21:56.800 --> 01:21:58.715
Is that so?

1216
01:21:58.715 --> 01:22:01.326
You know, like,
like, real feelings.


1217
01:22:06.157 --> 01:22:10.248
I think I might love him, actually.

1218
01:22:13.208 --> 01:22:14.861
Well...

1219
01:22:19.779 --> 01:22:21.433
What if he feels the same way?

1220
01:22:25.350 --> 01:22:27.744
Well, that's the thing, there's
nothing they can do about it


1221
01:22:27.744 --> 01:22:29.528
because there is this whole rule
that a teacher


1222
01:22:29.528 --> 01:22:31.400
can't get involved
with his <i>haumana.</i>


1223
01:22:31.400 --> 01:22:33.576
Oh, but he's not her teacher anymore.

1224
01:22:33.576 --> 01:22:35.578
And she's a <i>haumana</i> with a <i>halau</i>

1225
01:22:35.578 --> 01:22:37.710
that he's no longer a part of.

1226
01:22:39.756 --> 01:22:42.454
Though, there is this business

1227
01:22:42.454 --> 01:22:45.022
that he's hoping
she might partner with him on.


1228
01:22:57.861 --> 01:23:00.907
I've been waiting a long time
to do that.


1229
01:23:00.907 --> 01:23:04.041
- Me, too.
- My <i>haole hula</i> girl.
