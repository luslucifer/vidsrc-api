00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.488
- Yo!
<i>- Listen to this.</i>


2
00:01:19.571 --> 00:01:23.113
<i>Amber told Stacy she was down to do
some nasty shit with you after the game.</i>


3
00:01:23.196 --> 00:01:26.446
Macon, slow down, slow down.
Wait. Okay, which one is she?


4
00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.780
<i>You met her a hundred times. A-hole.</i>

5
00:01:28.863 --> 00:01:33.655
Hogwarts?
No, no, fuck that. You'd have to pay me.


6
00:01:33.738 --> 00:01:36.113
<i>What? Pay you?
She's throwing herself at you!</i>


7
00:01:36.196 --> 00:01:38.321
No, I'm serious.
Not even for, like, a million...


8
00:01:38.405 --> 00:01:41.780
<i>We really can't all be
flat-chested and pissed off like Hailey.</i>


9
00:01:41.863 --> 00:01:44.463
<i>Maybe, just maybe you should
lower your standards once in a while.</i>


10
00:01:44.488 --> 00:01:46.530
Um, Macon, hold up one second?

11
00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:49.530
Mom?

12
00:01:51.071 --> 00:01:52.155
Sadie?

13
00:01:56.738 --> 00:01:59.363
- I don't know. It's nothing.
<i>- I thought they were gone.</i>


14
00:01:59.446 --> 00:02:01.446
Yeah, they said
they were tailgating before.


15
00:02:02.571 --> 00:02:04.905
The fuck!

16
00:02:04.988 --> 00:02:07.988
I swear. My sister is licking
the powder off the Doritos


17
00:02:08.071 --> 00:02:13.113
and putting them back in the bag.
Fucking body dysmorphia at age eight.


18
00:02:13.196 --> 00:02:16.446
<i>She is a weird kid.
And I was a weird kid.</i>


19
00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.946
I'm just gonna crash before...

20
00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.780
<i>- Little stress relief!</i>
- Dude, I don't pregame that way.


21
00:02:23.863 --> 00:02:26.613
<i>Relax!
Why are you so serious right now?</i>


22
00:02:26.696 --> 00:02:28.988
'Cause it's like pure protein.

23
00:02:29.071 --> 00:02:31.446
Why would I want good protein
out of my body before...


24
00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.030
<i>All right, but do not oversleep.</i>

25
00:02:34.113 --> 00:02:36.738
Yeah, I'll be there.
Kickoff's in like four hours.


26
00:02:36.821 --> 00:02:39.071
<i>Well, I'm gonna go
lose protein for four hours.</i>


27
00:02:39.155 --> 00:02:42.530
Okay, yeah.
Have fun pregaming, perv.


28
00:03:16.196 --> 00:03:17.780
The fuck?

29
00:03:48.321 --> 00:03:50.113
Fuckin' truck.

30
00:04:13.488 --> 00:04:15.530
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

31
00:04:16.988 --> 00:04:18.738
<i>Hello, this is...</i>

32
00:04:40.405 --> 00:04:42.821
<i>- You've reached the Pace residence.</i>
- Shit!


33
00:04:42.905 --> 00:04:45.030
<i>Leave a message after the beep.</i>

34
00:05:35.696 --> 00:05:37.405
Whatever little game this is,

35
00:05:39.071 --> 00:05:40.863
whatever you think you know,

36
00:05:42.113 --> 00:05:43.363
you don't know shit!

37
00:06:19.696 --> 00:06:20.946
You're in my house,

38
00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:23.571
so I can legally kill you,

39
00:06:24.363 --> 00:06:25.738
you fuck!

40
00:06:26.738 --> 00:06:27.738
Come out!

41
00:06:36.321 --> 00:06:39.571
You want money?
Because I can Venmo you right now.


42
00:06:39.655 --> 00:06:41.863
Like, no one's gotta know.

43
00:06:41.946 --> 00:06:44.405
Hey, hey, hey.
Look, man, we... We were all wasted.


44
00:06:44.488 --> 00:06:46.448
It was...
It was just, like, a team bonding thing.


45
00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:48.446
Like... like, I swear.

46
00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:51.363
This isn't who I am! This isn't

47
00:06:52.363 --> 00:06:53.446
me?

48
00:07:14.363 --> 00:07:16.363
Pick up the phone, son.

49
00:07:16.446 --> 00:07:17.446
Hike!

50
00:07:18.571 --> 00:07:19.571
Goddamn it.

51
00:07:21.446 --> 00:07:24.363
<i>Fumble in the backfield!
Defense recovered!</i>


52
00:07:24.446 --> 00:07:26.738
<i>First down, 
Wampus Cats!</i>

53
00:07:26.821 --> 00:07:30.280
Hiss and scratch!
We're Wampus Cats!


54
00:07:30.363 --> 00:07:32.321
I'm sure he'll turn up. 
It's not like him.

55
00:07:34.071 --> 00:07:35.988
<i>Caleb Greeley
receives the handoff!</i>


56
00:07:36.988 --> 00:07:39.196
<i>Caleb out in the open!</i>

57
00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:40.696
<i>He's gonna go!</i>

58
00:07:46.363 --> 00:07:48.988
<i>Jackson, Jackson,
get off him! Get off him!</i>


59
00:07:49.863 --> 00:07:51.155
Whoo!

60
00:07:52.821 --> 00:07:54.261
<i>Caleb, you okay, man?</i>

61
00:07:54.321 --> 00:07:55.821
<i>Come on, man. 
You all right?</i>

62
00:08:09.113 --> 00:08:10.553
<i>Did you hear about Jackson?</i>

63
00:08:10.613 --> 00:08:12.613
<i>- So fucked up.
- Terrifying.</i>


64
00:08:12.696 --> 00:08:14.756
<i>- Who would do this?
- You saw that video.</i>


65
00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:16.780
<i>Jackson was out of line.</i>

66
00:08:16.863 --> 00:08:19.446
<i>So he beat someone up.
Doesn't mean he had to die.</i>


67
00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:21.571
<i>That was way more than hazing, though.</i>

68
00:08:21.655 --> 00:08:23.946
- <i>It was brutal.
- He targeted Caleb.</i>


69
00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:25.488
<i>Is it 'cause Caleb's gay?</i>

70
00:08:25.571 --> 00:08:27.571
<i>Probably jealous
Caleb's the better player.</i>


71
00:08:27.613 --> 00:08:29.363
<i>Caleb never even reported it.</i>

72
00:08:29.446 --> 00:08:30.905
<i>So who told?</i>

73
00:08:30.988 --> 00:08:32.696
<i>The whole team was there.</i>

74
00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:34.446
<i>They think Caleb's behind it.</i>

75
00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:36.964
<i>-</i>W <i>hat?
- He was in the game.</i>


76
00:08:36.988 --> 00:08:39.488
<i>He could've hired a killer.</i>

77
00:08:40.155 --> 00:08:41.738
<i>Everyone got the video.</i>

78
00:08:41.821 --> 00:08:43.905
<i>- Everyone.
- The whole town.</i>


79
00:08:44.905 --> 00:08:47.363
<i>- To make a point.
- What point?</i>


80
00:08:47.446 --> 00:08:48.446
<i>Who knows?</i>

81
00:08:48.946 --> 00:08:52.363
<i>- I'm honestly scared.
- What do we do? Go back to school?</i>


82
00:08:52.446 --> 00:08:54.922
<i>- I can't sleep.
- I can't live here anymore.</i>


83
00:08:54.946 --> 00:08:57.339
<i>- The sheriff have a suspect?
- He won't say.</i>


84
00:08:57.363 --> 00:08:58.738
<i>So sad, though.</i>

85
00:08:58.821 --> 00:09:00.696
<i>What if it happens again?</i>

86
00:09:37.821 --> 00:09:38.821
What?

87
00:09:39.405 --> 00:09:41.488
Store ran out of all the sad cards.

88
00:09:41.571 --> 00:09:45.280
Did I say anything? I think it's great,
really. I love that optimism.


89
00:09:45.363 --> 00:09:46.905
At least she got him something.

90
00:09:46.988 --> 00:09:48.428
Sorry I don't know
what to get a guy

91
00:09:48.488 --> 00:09:50.528
who beat the shit out of me
for fun for three years.


92
00:09:50.571 --> 00:09:51.571
Hmm.

93
00:09:53.321 --> 00:09:55.113
- Really?
- Wow.


94
00:09:55.863 --> 00:09:57.280
Built-in immunity.

95
00:09:57.363 --> 00:09:59.238
No teacher's gonna punish
the grief-stricken.


96
00:09:59.321 --> 00:10:00.821
Oh, that's actually pretty smart.

97
00:10:00.905 --> 00:10:03.446
Am I crazy, or are people
side-eyeing me right now?


98
00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:05.571
You're never crazy, babe.

99
00:10:05.655 --> 00:10:09.071
Caleb's getting it worse.
Fucked up they're blaming him.


100
00:10:09.155 --> 00:10:10.905
Of course they blame the gay guy.

101
00:10:11.655 --> 00:10:12.863
Last Friday night,

102
00:10:14.821 --> 00:10:17.446
Jackson Pace
took a knee on the field of life.


103
00:10:18.363 --> 00:10:21.238
But damn if he didn't live every day
like it was the fourth quarter.


104
00:10:21.946 --> 00:10:23.363
I'll never forget you, son.

116
00:11:02.363 --> 00:11:03.488
Now I wanna die.

117
00:11:04.988 --> 00:11:07.738
One time
we were having pizza, right?


118
00:11:07.821 --> 00:11:10.905
And I was telling him
I was having trouble finding Stacy's clit.


119
00:11:11.405 --> 00:11:12.905
Jackson goes with the pizza box,

120
00:11:12.988 --> 00:11:15.708
makes a diagram with pizza sauce
to show me where it was on her body.


121
00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:18.030
Classic Jackson.

122
00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:20.280
I'm literally right here.

123
00:11:21.863 --> 00:11:24.571
I got a prime suspect. Macon Bewley.

124
00:11:26.155 --> 00:11:29.571
Well, he's too dumb
not to get caught, so win-win.


125
00:11:32.571 --> 00:11:35.071
Alternate theory. My dad.

126
00:11:35.155 --> 00:11:36.696
Ah, you wish.

127
00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:37.988
Think about it.

128
00:11:38.071 --> 00:11:40.530
No way Jackson's parents
wanna live in that house


129
00:11:40.613 --> 00:11:43.363
on that farm
where their... where their kid was killed


130
00:11:43.446 --> 00:11:45.196
any longer than they have to, right?

131
00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:47.863
Who else wants that farm
more than Skipper Sandford,


132
00:11:47.946 --> 00:11:49.988
the land baron of Osborne?

133
00:11:50.071 --> 00:11:52.738
"Chaos breeds opportunity, boy."

134
00:11:52.821 --> 00:11:56.113
"And this is an opportunity
for Sandford Family Farms."


135
00:11:58.280 --> 00:11:59.780
You can sit with us.

136
00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:06.280
Uh.

137
00:12:06.738 --> 00:12:08.155
Sorry. Thanks.

138
00:12:08.738 --> 00:12:09.571
I'm Darby.

139
00:12:09.655 --> 00:12:11.946
I know. I'm Caleb.

140
00:12:12.863 --> 00:12:15.571
A pleasure to meet y'all,
I guess, officially.


141
00:12:17.155 --> 00:12:18.155
Caleb.

142
00:12:18.613 --> 00:12:20.196
It's not a country club, Caleb.

143
00:12:20.738 --> 00:12:21.738
I'm Makani.

144
00:12:22.655 --> 00:12:24.238
That's Rodrigo,

145
00:12:24.321 --> 00:12:25.488
Zach,

146
00:12:25.571 --> 00:12:27.530
and Alex. She's our bitch-in-residence.

147
00:12:27.613 --> 00:12:29.655
- Oh! Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.


148
00:12:29.738 --> 00:12:31.738
- My fellow seniors.
- You think I'm bad?


149
00:12:32.321 --> 00:12:34.488
If may have
your attention, please.


150
00:12:34.988 --> 00:12:36.238
Thank you.

151
00:12:36.321 --> 00:12:39.363
I mean, what can one say
in the wake of such sadness?


152
00:12:39.863 --> 00:12:41.488
Yet as your student council president,

153
00:12:41.571 --> 00:12:44.071
I feel it's imperative
that I provide a beacon,


154
00:12:44.155 --> 00:12:48.071
a kind of guiding light
in these dark and trying times.


155
00:12:49.113 --> 00:12:53.030
So, I'd like to read an excerpt
from my admission essay to Cornell.


156
00:12:53.655 --> 00:12:54.655
It's about oppression.

157
00:12:55.196 --> 00:12:59.030
Princess Diana of Wales once said,
in her infinite wisdom,


158
00:12:59.113 --> 00:13:02.988
that, "The greatest problem
in the world today is intolerance."


159
00:13:03.571 --> 00:13:06.488
Did bitch just quote a princess
instead of someone actually oppressed?


160
00:13:06.571 --> 00:13:09.238
We have a student here at my school

161
00:13:09.321 --> 00:13:11.905
who is an outer space enthusiast,

162
00:13:11.988 --> 00:13:14.446
but that's not the only thing
about this student that's alien.


163
00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:17.280
His name, or her name,

164
00:13:17.363 --> 00:13:19.613
depending on the day, is Darby.

165
00:13:20.238 --> 00:13:24.446
Born Justine Darby, this student
showed me the meaning of courage


166
00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:28.071
when, at age 11, she came out
to our school as she, he, and they,


167
00:13:28.155 --> 00:13:30.113
and now every day in my mind,

168
00:13:30.196 --> 00:13:33.280
I applaud her, him, and them.

169
00:13:38.238 --> 00:13:42.321
Jackson's video
and his death were hateful,


170
00:13:42.405 --> 00:13:44.238
and the only way to respond to hate...

171
00:13:46.238 --> 00:13:47.238
is with love.

172
00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:50.613
We love all versions of you, Darby, okay?

173
00:13:50.696 --> 00:13:52.530
Like we love all versions of Caleb.

174
00:13:53.613 --> 00:13:54.988
So please, guys,

175
00:13:55.071 --> 00:13:58.530
let's celebrate that love tomorrow
at the memorial at Holy Trinity.


176
00:13:58.613 --> 00:14:01.530
For now, though, a moment of silent,

177
00:14:01.613 --> 00:14:04.530
unenforced, nondenominational prayer.

178
00:14:25.321 --> 00:14:27.321
Fuck these reactive people!

179
00:14:27.405 --> 00:14:29.565
All of our college essays are about you.
You know that?


180
00:14:29.613 --> 00:14:30.905
I will cut you.

181
00:14:31.696 --> 00:14:34.756
- It'd be great if Katie was the killer.
- Or if the killer maybe killed Katie.


182
00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:37.530
And you just said that. 
And I liked it.

183
00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:44.196
"Sandford Family fucks."

184
00:14:48.655 --> 00:14:49.655
I mean,

185
00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:51.613
it <i>is</i> factual.

186
00:14:52.321 --> 00:14:53.613
My dad is a fuck.

187
00:14:54.988 --> 00:14:56.506
- Wanna smoke?
- Yes.


188
00:14:56.530 --> 00:14:59.863
<i>♪ I don't give a flying... Ahh! ♪</i>

189
00:14:59.946 --> 00:15:01.613
<i>♪ Bite me, bite me ♪</i>

190
00:15:01.696 --> 00:15:03.738
<i>♪ You can try me, try me ♪</i>

191
00:15:03.821 --> 00:15:05.030
<i>♪ If you likey... ♪</i>

192
00:15:05.113 --> 00:15:06.488
Caleb seemed cool.

193
00:15:08.446 --> 00:15:10.988
Okay, okay, okay.
Let me rephrase that, you dicks.


194
00:15:12.238 --> 00:15:14.321
I like that you
let him sit with us

195
00:15:14.405 --> 00:15:17.405
'cause that's what you guys did for me
when I first transferred here.


196
00:15:17.488 --> 00:15:19.363
Oh my God.
Those guys kept calling you Moana.


197
00:15:19.446 --> 00:15:20.363
I love that movie.

198
00:15:20.446 --> 00:15:23.488
- It's not really an insult.
- Not just those guys. That was Jackson.


199
00:15:23.571 --> 00:15:25.363
So you've been biding your time, huh?

200
00:15:28.655 --> 00:15:29.821
Oh shit!

201
00:15:29.905 --> 00:15:31.030
Shit!

202
00:15:31.113 --> 00:15:33.155
Speaking of most likely to murder.

203
00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:36.946
Who even smokes cigarettes anymore?

204
00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:39.988
Oliver Larsson
because he's a fucking sociopath.


205
00:15:40.071 --> 00:15:41.780
You think everyone's a sociopath.

206
00:15:41.863 --> 00:15:44.571
Yeah, but real talk,
his folks straight-up opted out of life


207
00:15:44.655 --> 00:15:46.321
'cause their son had zero human emotions.

208
00:15:47.238 --> 00:15:50.078
I'm gonna opt out of life
if I don't hear about that fellowship.


209
00:15:50.821 --> 00:15:52.863
Last night, my mom said I could

210
00:15:52.946 --> 00:15:55.821
"always answer phones
at the slaughterhouse."


211
00:15:55.905 --> 00:15:59.113
Now I know why everyone
treats graduation like a death sentence.


212
00:15:59.196 --> 00:16:00.196
In Osborne, it is.

213
00:16:00.238 --> 00:16:02.696
Except it's
literally the opposite of that.


214
00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:05.071
It is the opposite of the end.

215
00:16:05.155 --> 00:16:07.821
Yes. Yes!

216
00:16:07.905 --> 00:16:10.655
It's the opposite
of the end, motherfucker!


217
00:16:21.155 --> 00:16:22.155
Just thought,

218
00:16:23.905 --> 00:16:25.280
"Here you are, Sabrina,

219
00:16:25.363 --> 00:16:28.238
asking your granddaughter
to take a big step with college and all,


220
00:16:28.321 --> 00:16:31.405
and I won't even take
a tiny step to fix my own stuff."


221
00:16:32.863 --> 00:16:35.155
So I signed up for next month.

222
00:16:35.238 --> 00:16:36.905
Or if you just drank your tea.

223
00:16:36.988 --> 00:16:38.196
Oh, man.

224
00:16:40.113 --> 00:16:42.071
Heard you walking around last night.

225
00:16:42.155 --> 00:16:44.655
You don't think I notice
you changing the subject?


226
00:16:45.571 --> 00:16:49.530
Honey, I'm sure all this horrible stuff
at school is dredging up memories.


227
00:16:49.613 --> 00:16:52.113
You need to focus here
on your application.


228
00:16:52.196 --> 00:16:55.071
What's the point?
All they have to do is Google my name,


229
00:16:55.155 --> 00:16:56.405
my real name,

230
00:16:57.571 --> 00:17:00.988
and then all that financial aid
and friends I might've made is just,


231
00:17:01.655 --> 00:17:03.613
"Bye." So what's the point?

232
00:17:03.696 --> 00:17:06.738
The point is that's not you anymore.

233
00:17:07.363 --> 00:17:09.363
I see you up there
in your mama's old room,


234
00:17:09.446 --> 00:17:12.071
all her old stuff still on the walls.

235
00:17:12.155 --> 00:17:14.030
Like you don't even have a say.

236
00:17:14.696 --> 00:17:17.905
You have to stop blaming yourself
for what happened.


237
00:17:23.446 --> 00:17:24.446
Okay.

238
00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:28.780
But you gotta drink that tea for me.

239
00:17:29.363 --> 00:17:30.238

- Good night, hon.


255
00:19:01.946 --> 00:19:03.363
<i>Hey, Jasmine.</i>

256
00:19:04.113 --> 00:19:05.280
<i>What's your name?</i>

257
00:19:07.446 --> 00:19:09.363
<i>I said, "What's your name?"</i>

258
00:19:20.071 --> 00:19:21.113
Gam.

259
00:19:23.863 --> 00:19:25.571
You're sleepwalking again.

260
00:19:35.530 --> 00:19:38.071
That's... new.

261
00:19:51.113 --> 00:19:52.113
Gam.

262
00:20:04.238 --> 00:20:05.238
Gam?

263
00:20:24.405 --> 00:20:25.405
Hey.

264
00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:27.488
Grandma, wake up.

265
00:20:29.363 --> 00:20:31.071
You were sleepwalking again.

266
00:20:33.696 --> 00:20:34.738
Did I?

267
00:20:37.988 --> 00:20:38.988
Oh.

268
00:20:39.321 --> 00:20:42.446
Maybe we should skip
the early service tomorrow, okay?


269
00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:52.071
I mean,
Caleb's got to be behind this.


270
00:20:52.738 --> 00:20:54.696
I think he hired someone.

271
00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:56.905
'Cause all due respect
to the dearly departed,


272
00:20:56.988 --> 00:21:01.696
but I have watched a lot of true crime,
and this was clearly premeditated,


273
00:21:02.405 --> 00:21:03.405
right?

274
00:21:03.738 --> 00:21:05.238
I mean, who do you think it...

275
00:21:06.530 --> 00:21:07.530
Marcus?

276
00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:26.571
- Seriously, stop it.
<i>- Uh, what?</i>


277
00:21:26.655 --> 00:21:29.175
- I know you're not sick.
<i>- What are you talking about?</i>


278
00:21:29.238 --> 00:21:31.738
'Cause I was just talking to you. Here.

279
00:21:32.405 --> 00:21:33.946
You were right here.

280
00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:37.655
<i>Some races
have higher IQs than other races.</i>


281
00:21:37.738 --> 00:21:40.780
<i>- It's basic science. Look it up.
- I'm not lying.</i>


282
00:21:40.863 --> 00:21:42.196
Marcus, I'll call you back.

283
00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:44.863
<i>And yet these libtard academics,</i>

284
00:21:44.946 --> 00:21:49.071
<i>who keep proclaiming
to be the protectors of science,</i>


285
00:21:49.155 --> 00:21:51.155
<i>suddenly start crying, "Fake news!"</i>

286
00:21:51.238 --> 00:21:54.738
<i>when all we're doing
is presenting scientific fact.</i>


287
00:21:54.821 --> 00:21:56.280
<i>And why is that?</i>

288
00:21:56.363 --> 00:22:00.488
<i>Because liberals worship
at the altar of equality and diversity.</i>


289
00:22:01.071 --> 00:22:03.238
<i>Which means every little snowflake</i>

290
00:22:03.321 --> 00:22:06.238
<i>has to be exactly the same,
and there can be no differences.</i>


291
00:22:06.321 --> 00:22:07.780
Oh my...

292
00:22:07.863 --> 00:22:09.488
<i>Makes you wonder</i>

293
00:22:09.571 --> 00:22:11.321
<i>- how many good white Americans</i>...
<i>-</i>Look.


294
00:22:11.405 --> 00:22:15.280
- Hey, I don't know who...
- what this is.


295
00:22:19.321 --> 00:22:22.988
Okay. Okay, so maybe I recorded,
like, one episode of a podcast,


296
00:22:23.071 --> 00:22:24.488
but no one was supposed to...

297
00:22:25.238 --> 00:22:27.238
l posted it anonymously.

298
00:22:27.905 --> 00:22:30.571
Also, it's like...
it's like satire, you know?


299
00:22:30.655 --> 00:22:33.321
It's a goof.
I... I'm making fun of these fucks, right?


300
00:22:34.655 --> 00:22:36.821
<i>I am a racial realist, people.</i>

303
00:22:44.155 --> 00:22:46.155
<i>I'm just saying
they're not as smart, okay?</i>


304
00:23:01.238 --> 00:23:03.988
...the occasion,
I love that you wore yellow.


305
00:23:04.696 --> 00:23:06.321
It should be open by now, right?

306
00:23:21.113 --> 00:23:24.780
<i>Each ethnicity

307
00:23:24.863 --> 00:23:27.571
<i>Truth is, these SJWs,</i>

308
00:23:28.446 --> 00:23:31.905
<i>all they want to do

311

00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:45.196
<i>are gonna be sacrificed on that altar</i>

314
00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:48.530
<i>before we realize
the emperor has no clothes.</i>


315
00:23:56.988 --> 00:23:58.613
I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry!

316
00:24:02.655 --> 00:24:06.113
<i>Don't need Wikipedia
to figure that out. It's history.</i>


317
00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:09.571
<i>But that does not make us superior.
They just...</i>


318
00:24:15.071 --> 00:24:17.696
<i>...on average, than all other races.</i>

319
00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:20.696
<i>- 911, what's your emergency?</i>
- Hi, the killer's here.


320
00:24:21.863 --> 00:24:23.280
He's wearing a mask of my face,

321
00:24:23.363 --> 00:24:26.571
and he's forcing me to record
offensive hate speech at knifepoi...


322
00:24:32.155 --> 00:24:33.821
<i>Unlike a progressive,</i>

323
00:24:33.905 --> 00:24:37.363
<i>who'd argue even an aborted fetus
can qualify for the Olympics.</i>


324
00:24:37.446 --> 00:24:38.863
...use it for something.

325
00:24:38.946 --> 00:24:40.530
- Hi, Father!
- Oh, I'm sorry.


326
00:24:40.613 --> 00:24:41.905
No, no.

327
00:24:43.738 --> 00:24:46.113
Do you hear that?

328
00:24:46.821 --> 00:24:49.821
<i>...establish our own white communities,</i>

329
00:24:49.905 --> 00:24:52.280
<i>our own white school system.</i>

330
00:24:53.155 --> 00:24:55.530
- <i>I mean, that's the dream, right?</i>
- Goodness!


331
00:24:55.613 --> 00:24:58.113
<i>White kids actually getting to celebrate</i>

332
00:24:58.196 --> 00:25:02.113
<i>their beautiful, 
God-given white skin.</i>

333
00:25:06.405 --> 00:25:08.905
<i>Rest assured,
we are following every lead</i>,


334
00:25:08.988 --> 00:25:11.571
<i>working 24-7 to solve these crimes,</i>

335
00:25:11.655 --> 00:25:15.196
<i>which is why we're enacting
a citywide curfew, 8:00 p.m.,</i>


336
00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:18.946
<i>merely as a precaution,
but one thing is clear.</i>


337
00:25:19.030 --> 00:25:21.363
<i>The killer or killers seem intent</i>

338
00:25:21.446 --> 00:25:24.446
<i>on exposing intimate information</i>

339
00:25:24.530 --> 00:25:28.071
<i>about his or her or their victims.</i>

340
00:25:28.155 --> 00:25:31.113
<i>And since both victims
were seniors at Osborne High,</i>


341
00:25:31.821 --> 00:25:33.821
<i>that's where we're gonna start looking.</i>

342
00:25:33.905 --> 00:25:35.946
<i>There's a lot of rumors going around</i>

343
00:25:36.030 --> 00:25:38.613
<i>that the killer wore a mask
of victims' faces</i>


344
00:25:38.696 --> 00:25:39.988
<i>or has cameras.</i>

345
00:25:40.655 --> 00:25:42.780
<i>We're just focusing on what we know.</i>

346
00:26:24.988 --> 00:26:25.821
Hey.

347
00:26:25.905 --> 00:26:27.922
Aren't you glad you moved here?

348
00:26:27.946 --> 00:26:29.655
- Let me in!
<i>- What?</i>


349
00:26:30.363 --> 00:26:32.613
- I'm on the phone!
- Did you lock the door?


350
00:26:33.738 --> 00:26:35.155
Goddamn it!

351
00:26:36.488 --> 00:26:39.905
- Sorry, my mom is just like...
<i>- I know. I know.</i>


352
00:26:39.988 --> 00:26:41.613
You ain't gotta apologize.

353
00:26:41.696 --> 00:26:44.446
<i>You know, you're
so lucky you don't live with parents.</i>


354
00:26:45.655 --> 00:26:46.655
You all right?

355
00:26:47.238 --> 00:26:49.238
Oh yeah. I just... 
I have a cold.

356
00:26:51.821 --> 00:26:53.655
Just been taking some cold medicine.

357
00:26:53.738 --> 00:26:54.571
Hmm.

358
00:26:54.655 --> 00:26:58.363
<i>Look,
I know this sounds selfish,</i>


359
00:26:58.863 --> 00:27:01.780
but can't I just have a normal life
where no one gets murdered,


360
00:27:01.863 --> 00:27:05.446
and I get a girlfriend, and I go
to college, and I get to program games?


361
00:27:05.530 --> 00:27:06.821
I mean, is that stupid?

362
00:27:06.905 --> 00:27:09.946
<i>It's stupid. Just... 
You can ignore me.</i>

363
00:27:10.030 --> 00:27:13.655
You keep calling me, Ro,
when I know you really wanna call Alex.


364
00:27:15.405 --> 00:27:17.280
I'm just kind of afraid, maybe.

365
00:27:19.238 --> 00:27:20.696
<i>You hide it so well.</i>

366
00:27:21.613 --> 00:27:24.530
I guess we can't hide
anything anymore. Can we?


367
00:27:35.238 --> 00:27:36.863
What do you think they're asking?

368
00:27:37.363 --> 00:27:41.780
If you're white, "What's good on TV?"
If you're brown, "Why are you murdering?"


369
00:27:41.863 --> 00:27:43.488
Yeah, hence this itchy-ass suit.

370
00:27:43.571 --> 00:27:45.113
Uh, Macon Bewley.

371
00:27:45.196 --> 00:27:47.321
Think the killer's in this room right now?

372
00:27:47.821 --> 00:27:48.863
I don't know.

373
00:27:49.363 --> 00:27:51.821
Makes my head hurt.
Doesn't make sense, you know?


374
00:27:51.905 --> 00:27:53.946
Like, why would the killer go after Katie?

375
00:27:54.030 --> 00:27:57.863
Because Katie
and Jackson both had secrets.


376
00:27:59.238 --> 00:28:02.238
- Hey, look at his body language.
- Look at his face.


377
00:28:02.321 --> 00:28:05.155
He's touching his mouth.
He's not making any eye contact.


378
00:28:05.238 --> 00:28:07.571
It's the two top-ten tells
someone's full of shit.


379
00:28:07.655 --> 00:28:08.655
Hmm.

380
00:28:09.030 --> 00:28:10.488
You see everything, Ro.

381
00:28:11.571 --> 00:28:12.738
It's exhausting.

382
00:28:14.196 --> 00:28:16.571
You know,
this happens all the time.


383
00:28:16.655 --> 00:28:19.363
Football players getting brain damage.
They start stabbing people.


384
00:28:19.446 --> 00:28:21.363
It's like... It's a thing.

385
00:28:21.446 --> 00:28:24.488
You know it's just as cliché
to hate football as it is to play it?


386
00:28:25.155 --> 00:28:27.655
- They're not the worst.
- They're the worst to you.


387
00:28:27.738 --> 00:28:29.613
Confused, okay. 
There's a difference.

388
00:28:31.571 --> 00:28:32.571
Mmm.

389
00:28:33.446 --> 00:28:35.655
You guys are looking
at the wrong side of the table.


390
00:28:37.363 --> 00:28:38.946
- The sheriff?
- Hello?


391
00:28:39.030 --> 00:28:40.790
There's a referendum
on the ballot next month


392
00:28:40.821 --> 00:28:42.181
to dissolve the Police Department.

393
00:28:42.238 --> 00:28:44.905
- That's legal?
- Replace it with private security.


394
00:28:44.988 --> 00:28:47.988
But not if he
solves a series of murders,

395
00:28:48.071 --> 00:28:51.363
and by that, I mean blaming it
on someone who's not white


396
00:28:51.446 --> 00:28:52.905
and becoming a local hero.

397
00:28:52.988 --> 00:28:54.196
Comforting.

398
00:28:58.238 --> 00:29:01.738
Or it could just be the most obvious.

399
00:29:01.821 --> 00:29:04.488
Tragic past, no friends.

400
00:29:04.571 --> 00:29:05.821
So, basically us.

401
00:29:05.905 --> 00:29:06.905
What? No.

402
00:29:07.738 --> 00:29:09.988
No, you guys just are who you are.

403
00:29:10.655 --> 00:29:12.571
That's your thing.
You don't have any secrets.


404
00:29:13.155 --> 00:29:16.030
Unless you got something
you wanna let us know.


405
00:29:16.613 --> 00:29:18.030
Zachariah Sandford.

406
00:29:18.821 --> 00:29:21.780
Your dad's lawyer
just invoked your constitutional rights,


407
00:29:21.863 --> 00:29:23.863
so you're free to go.

408
00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:25.905
What a joke!

409
00:29:25.988 --> 00:29:29.238
Of course. Lucky him. Whatever.

410
00:29:32.821 --> 00:29:35.946
Careful out there, friend.
I mean that with love.


411
00:29:36.696 --> 00:29:38.363
There's some crazy fucks in this town.

412
00:29:39.738 --> 00:29:43.071
RIP with Dave,
the best and only Uber driver in town.


413
00:29:43.155 --> 00:29:45.280
That's "ride in peace." Want a flyer?

414
00:29:47.155 --> 00:29:49.071
How about you guys? 
Are you going in?

415
00:29:56.196 --> 00:29:58.905
I, uh... I drove myself. So...

416
00:30:12.446 --> 00:30:13.446
Dad, I'm sorry.

417
00:30:13.488 --> 00:30:16.530
I'm trying to put those boys
out of business this next election.


418
00:30:16.613 --> 00:30:18.613
- I know.
- Yet here you are.


419
00:30:19.446 --> 00:30:21.797
I was halfway to
the International Terminal in Omaha when...


420
00:30:21.821 --> 00:30:23.155
Everyone was coming.

421
00:30:23.238 --> 00:30:26.321
- My friends...
- Friends? Those are not friends.


422
00:30:26.821 --> 00:30:29.196
They are what's left
when no one else wants to know you.


423
00:30:33.321 --> 00:30:34.988
You stink of marijuana.

424
00:30:35.071 --> 00:30:38.071
I'm public enemy number one to those boys,

425
00:30:38.155 --> 00:30:42.863
which makes you public enemy number two,
and yet you have the audacity...


426
00:30:42.946 --> 00:30:46.613
No, I'm sorry, the goddamned stupidity

427
00:30:47.238 --> 00:30:50.821
to smoke drugs and then
walk directly into the lion's den.


428
00:30:54.946 --> 00:30:56.363
Take your truck home.

429
00:30:56.946 --> 00:30:59.738
Get that goddamn graffiti buffed out.
It's embarrassing.


430
00:31:18.905 --> 00:31:19.946
Hey, Ollie.

431
00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:22.280
Hey, Makani.

432
00:31:22.321 --> 00:31:26.530
I'm sorry, I'm staring. I just...
I got nothing to do till my brother's off.


433
00:31:26.613 --> 00:31:31.196
Oh, I get it, Ollie.
Such is your burden.


434
00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:32.696
Yeah, pretty much.

435
00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:36.446
Did you cut your hair?
Yeah, I cut it myself.


436
00:31:37.030 --> 00:31:38.030
Wow.

437
00:31:38.488 --> 00:31:39.863
It's a good haircut, Ollie.

438
00:31:39.946 --> 00:31:42.988
Also, I'm sorry I've been ignoring you
since school started.


439
00:31:43.071 --> 00:31:45.089
- I've just been...
- Are you serious with all this?


440
00:31:45.113 --> 00:31:47.655
Yeah, yeah.
I used scissors and everything.


441
00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:04.863
I have a theory.

442
00:32:07.321 --> 00:32:10.946
I think you like being around
someone more fucked up than you.


443
00:32:12.196 --> 00:32:16.988
Because it made you feel normal,
but then summer was over, school started.


444
00:32:17.071 --> 00:32:19.446
You had to go back
to pretending you <i>are</i> normal,


445
00:32:19.530 --> 00:32:21.238
which you're not.

446
00:32:22.113 --> 00:32:23.530
That's a compliment.

447
00:32:26.780 --> 00:32:30.030
And being seen with me
endangered that image.


448
00:32:31.238 --> 00:32:35.030
That an original theory, or did you
just watch <i>Grease</i>for the first time?


449
00:32:38.488 --> 00:32:43.780
Hey, little brother.
Um, did you see anyone take my Taser?


450
00:32:44.446 --> 00:32:45.446
No.

451
00:32:47.696 --> 00:32:49.738
All right.

452
00:32:51.405 --> 00:32:52.446
Makani Young.

453
00:32:56.696 --> 00:32:59.030
It says here you transferred
junior year from...


454
00:33:01.071 --> 00:33:03.030
Kamehamea.

455
00:33:03.113 --> 00:33:04.363
Did I say that right?

456
00:33:04.446 --> 00:33:05.446
Um...

457
00:33:09.196 --> 00:33:10.780
Any reason you left?

458
00:33:12.571 --> 00:33:14.530
Um, no, I mean...

459
00:33:14.613 --> 00:33:17.238
And you had no relationship
with Jackson or Katie at all?


460
00:33:18.821 --> 00:33:21.821
Never argued, never saw them
argue with somebody else?


461
00:33:24.071 --> 00:33:25.071
No.

462
00:33:26.155 --> 00:33:27.155
You seem tense.

463
00:33:35.321 --> 00:33:37.030
Look, it's pretty obvious here.

464
00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:40.280
You're a good kid.

465
00:33:41.988 --> 00:33:42.988
Work hard.

466
00:33:44.696 --> 00:33:47.655
There's a lot of pressure
to be perfect. I'm sure.


467
00:33:49.530 --> 00:33:50.530
But...

468
00:33:52.905 --> 00:33:54.696
...you say you didn't know Katie?

469
00:33:56.905 --> 00:33:59.321
A lot of her best friends
are feeling the same way, that


470
00:34:00.821 --> 00:34:02.280
they didn't know her at all.

471
00:34:07.696 --> 00:34:10.196
It's funny how sometimes
it's easier to be ourselves


472
00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:12.238
around strangers than our own friends.

473
00:34:17.988 --> 00:34:20.155
I should write that down. I should...

474
00:34:20.738 --> 00:34:22.196
You're... you're free to go.

475
00:34:22.821 --> 00:34:24.905
Thanks. "It's funny how..."

476
00:34:35.571 --> 00:34:38.321
- Let's get out of here.
- There's curfew.


477
00:34:54.946 --> 00:34:56.780
Did you wanna talk about something?

478
00:35:02.488 --> 00:35:04.238
Let's just do what we always do.

506
00:37:35.905 --> 00:37:37.196
I miss this.

507
00:37:45.780 --> 00:37:47.155
Jesus!

508
00:37:47.238 --> 00:37:49.321
- What the fuck?
- Whoa!


509
00:37:50.863 --> 00:37:52.321
That was Randall Brice.

510
00:37:53.780 --> 00:37:55.030
Macon's friend?

511
00:37:55.655 --> 00:37:56.655
What the hell?

512
00:37:56.738 --> 00:37:59.280
Yeah! Whoo!

513
00:37:59.363 --> 00:38:00.530
Let's go!

514
00:38:05.988 --> 00:38:06.988
Oh shit.

515
00:38:09.238 --> 00:38:12.821
Looks like Zach's
gonna be the next one murdered.


516
00:38:14.446 --> 00:38:15.655
By his dad.

517
00:38:20.030 --> 00:38:21.280
Let's go to a party.

518
00:38:28.780 --> 00:38:31.446
Drink, but don't drive.
I'll drive! I'm Dave.


519
00:38:31.530 --> 00:38:32.530
Great.

520
00:38:32.571 --> 00:38:34.738
Want one of these? It's a flyer.

521
00:38:34.821 --> 00:38:37.988
I'll drive you home or anywhere else
you wanna go. I don't care.


522
00:38:38.071 --> 00:38:40.030
Don't drink and drive. 
Drink and Dave!

523
00:38:40.113 --> 00:38:41.155
Take a flyer.

524
00:38:42.238 --> 00:38:44.155
Embrace youth! Enjoy it!

525
00:38:44.738 --> 00:38:47.363
You know how to find Dave.
Just download that app.


526
00:38:47.446 --> 00:38:50.405
Ten bucks off your first ride.
Surge pricing may apply.


527
00:38:51.696 --> 00:38:52.696
Okay.

528
00:38:53.321 --> 00:38:54.321
That's fine.

529
00:38:56.155 --> 00:38:57.405
Party looks fun.

530
00:38:57.488 --> 00:38:59.613
<i>♪ Secret... ♪</i>

531
00:39:00.196 --> 00:39:03.571
They hire illegals to work
the slaughterhouse and then don't pay 'em!


532
00:39:03.655 --> 00:39:04.935
I post dick pics online!

533
00:39:04.988 --> 00:39:07.339
I eat junk food all the time
and never gain weight,


534
00:39:07.363 --> 00:39:09.030
and people hate me for it.

535
00:39:09.113 --> 00:39:12.030
So, your secret's you're perfect?
Fuck off.


536
00:39:12.946 --> 00:39:16.238
I have a YouTube channel
where I try to sing opera.


537
00:39:16.321 --> 00:39:17.738
Oh my God, I know.

538
00:39:17.821 --> 00:39:19.863
- Wait. You're the one who's watching?
- Yes.


539
00:39:20.530 --> 00:39:23.280
Last year I had a miscarriage.

540
00:39:23.363 --> 00:39:26.613
Wait, are we telling real secrets?

541
00:39:28.863 --> 00:39:30.321
Secret party.

542
00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:33.696
It's about time!

543
00:39:33.780 --> 00:39:35.530
Oh my God! Come on!

544
00:39:35.613 --> 00:39:37.821
I find myself
attracted to my cousin.


545
00:39:37.905 --> 00:39:40.655
Rodrigo, move!
This is your drink. Drink this.


546
00:39:46.613 --> 00:39:48.672
You know,
I accidentally ran over a hitchhiker


547
00:39:48.696 --> 00:39:51.446
and dumped his body into the ocean.
Is that bad? 'Cause I can't tell.


548
00:39:51.530 --> 00:39:55.155
Wait, sorry, but everyone's
just telling each other their secrets?


549
00:39:55.238 --> 00:39:56.321
Genius, right?

550
00:39:56.405 --> 00:40:00.030
By publicly admitting the one thing
the killer's using against us,


551
00:40:00.113 --> 00:40:01.473
we're taking away his only weapon.

552
00:40:01.530 --> 00:40:03.321
Except for, like, when it's a knife.

553
00:40:03.405 --> 00:40:05.780
There's no way your dad
sanctioned this, though.


554
00:40:05.863 --> 00:40:08.446
Sadly, Skipper's en route
to a big-game safari


555
00:40:08.530 --> 00:40:10.363
he couldn't possibly pass up, so...

556
00:40:10.446 --> 00:40:11.696
Can we help you?

557
00:40:12.655 --> 00:40:13.655
Yeah, you.

558
00:40:13.696 --> 00:40:17.280
All-in-black, school-shooter-style icon,
you keep looking at us.


559
00:40:18.030 --> 00:40:19.113
Do you have a secret?

560
00:40:19.196 --> 00:40:23.196
Would you like to unburden yourself,
or are you just creeping like a creep?


561
00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:25.571
Hey, man!
Everyone knows you're a sociopath!


562
00:40:25.655 --> 00:40:27.363
Ro!

563
00:40:28.030 --> 00:40:30.030
Oh my God, guys. 
That was really mean.

564
00:40:30.113 --> 00:40:31.238
No! No, it wasn't.

565
00:40:31.321 --> 00:40:33.488
I might have a real confession.

566
00:40:37.863 --> 00:40:39.071
I got in.

567
00:40:39.155 --> 00:40:41.113
- What?
- Oh my... You got in!


568
00:40:41.196 --> 00:40:43.863
- Oh my God!
- Oh my God! No way!


569
00:40:45.113 --> 00:40:47.155
- Don't make me cry. Don't make me cry.
- Okay.


570
00:40:47.238 --> 00:40:49.363
Okay, all right. 
Okay, okay, okay. Okay.

571
00:40:50.613 --> 00:40:52.321
I have a secret.

572
00:40:52.405 --> 00:40:54.946
Really? I thought
we were the ones with no secrets.


573
00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:58.988
I have a secret crush on...

574
00:41:02.488 --> 00:41:04.571
Because you're dead-ass funny

575
00:41:04.655 --> 00:41:06.446
in such a low-frequency way,

576
00:41:06.530 --> 00:41:09.155
but I hear it, and I love it.

577
00:41:09.238 --> 00:41:12.321
All right, all right! This is fun!
All right! Rodrigo, go.


578
00:41:12.405 --> 00:41:13.488
What's your secret?

579
00:41:15.530 --> 00:41:17.655
Same.

580
00:41:17.738 --> 00:41:19.738
- What?
- Wait, really?


581
00:41:22.863 --> 00:41:23.863
Um, Makani?

582
00:41:26.363 --> 00:41:27.363
Um,

583
00:41:28.946 --> 00:41:30.155
I write poetry.

584
00:41:30.238 --> 00:41:31.613
Wait, really? No way.

585
00:41:32.196 --> 00:41:35.238
And, uh, I'm not gonna graduate.

586
00:41:35.738 --> 00:41:37.071
How's this for poetry?

587
00:41:37.988 --> 00:41:41.905
"This letter's to inform you
that your son, Zachariah Sandford,


588
00:41:41.988 --> 00:41:43.863
is at risk of failing classes."

589
00:41:43.946 --> 00:41:47.571
"His current GPA is a one-point fucked."

590
00:41:48.071 --> 00:41:51.571
Yeah,
but that's not the real secret.


591
00:41:51.655 --> 00:41:53.280
The real secret...

592
00:41:53.363 --> 00:41:54.946
Shit.

593
00:41:55.030 --> 00:41:57.905
Whoa, whoa! Guys, whoa! Chill, chill.

594
00:41:58.488 --> 00:42:01.655
The only thing
it's loaded with is meaning.


595
00:42:03.196 --> 00:42:04.839
- What? No!
- Oh, my God!


596
00:42:04.863 --> 00:42:06.321
- Zach! Zach!
- Dude!


597
00:42:06.405 --> 00:42:07.488
What the hell?

598
00:42:10.696 --> 00:42:12.363
Dude!

599
00:42:12.446 --> 00:42:17.071
- Crazy.
- Which brings me to tonight's main event.


600
00:42:17.821 --> 00:42:18.821
Ooh.

601
00:42:21.946 --> 00:42:23.821
- You laugh at me.
- Yeah.


602
00:42:23.905 --> 00:42:25.905
- You make fun of me.
- Yeah.


603
00:42:25.988 --> 00:42:28.488
You... you... you tag my truck.

604
00:42:28.571 --> 00:42:30.905
Fuck yeah, we did!

605
00:42:30.988 --> 00:42:33.405
I get it. It makes sense.

606
00:42:34.196 --> 00:42:38.196
You think that my father
is this festering pustule


607
00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:41.238
disguised as a God-fearing pillar
of the community.


608
00:42:41.821 --> 00:42:45.488
He buys up your families' land
for pennies on the dollar.


609
00:42:45.571 --> 00:42:46.988
And for what?

610
00:42:47.071 --> 00:42:51.613
Just so he can grow his 30,000-plus
acre corporate empire of shit!


611
00:42:51.696 --> 00:42:53.071
- Fuck that shit!
- Yeah.


612
00:42:53.155 --> 00:42:55.863
But, what if I told you...

613
00:42:57.863 --> 00:43:02.321
Skipper Sandford's collection
extended far beyond corn...


614
00:43:03.696 --> 00:43:05.530
- Whoa!
- What?


615
00:43:05.613 --> 00:43:10.071
...and included the tenth largest
Nazi memorabilia collection


616
00:43:10.155 --> 00:43:11.363
in all of North America?

617
00:43:11.446 --> 00:43:13.113
That's fucked up.

618
00:43:13.738 --> 00:43:15.405
A shocking amount of which

619
00:43:15.488 --> 00:43:16.988
I have converted

620
00:43:17.071 --> 00:43:21.280
into pipes, hookahs, and bongs.

621
00:43:21.363 --> 00:43:23.821
Of course!

622
00:43:23.905 --> 00:43:25.321
Dude, no way!

623
00:43:25.405 --> 00:43:28.821
- That's crazy.
- So, allow me to propose a toast.


624
00:43:29.946 --> 00:43:32.988
The 1% is burning down
the world so they can stay warm.

00:43:33.571 --> 00:43:36.363
I say, "Let it burn down <i>them</i> too."

626
00:43:36.446 --> 00:43:37.571
Yeah!

627
00:43:37.655 --> 00:43:39.655
While we burn down Highway 420.

628
00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:42.321

Wait, wait, wait. You, uh...

649
00:44:44.321 --> 00:44:46.655
You meant it, right?
You weren't just saying that?


650
00:44:46.738 --> 00:44:47.988
I'm your secret?

651
00:44:53.113 --> 00:44:54.530
What... what do you want?

652
00:44:55.571 --> 00:44:57.071
Chips?

653
00:45:01.071 --> 00:45:03.113
- Salt and vinegar?
- Fuck off!


654
00:45:03.196 --> 00:45:05.196
Sorry.

655
00:45:05.780 --> 00:45:07.655
You're my secret. Yeah.

656
00:45:09.571 --> 00:45:10.988
I see you, Ro.

657
00:45:12.238 --> 00:45:13.530
I always have.

658
00:45:28.363 --> 00:45:29.363
So,

659
00:45:30.321 --> 00:45:31.696
see you back with the others?

660
00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:34.280
Yeah. Thank you.

661
00:45:34.863 --> 00:45:36.738
Did... did you just thank me?

662
00:45:37.988 --> 00:45:39.030
No.

663
00:45:39.113 --> 00:45:42.155
Sorry, that... that would be...
that would be... would be stupid.


664
00:46:31.530 --> 00:46:32.905
Did you make this?

665
00:46:33.655 --> 00:46:36.780
- Your secret's you're taking painkillers?
- Fentanyl?


666
00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:39.321
Oh, that shit's for junkies.

667
00:46:40.405 --> 00:46:43.363
- Yo, what's going on?
- Who the fuck turned out my lights?


668
00:46:43.446 --> 00:46:45.821
- Power go out?
- Alex!


669
00:46:45.905 --> 00:46:47.071
Rodrigo!

670
00:46:47.155 --> 00:46:49.113
Rodrigo, we're over here!

671
00:46:49.196 --> 00:46:50.696
Guys, where are you?

672
00:46:51.321 --> 00:46:52.571
Zach, what's going on, man?

673
00:46:54.738 --> 00:46:57.863
Shit! There's someone
wearing Rodrigo's fucking face!


674
00:46:57.946 --> 00:47:00.363
The killer's here!

675
00:47:00.446 --> 00:47:01.905
Alex! Alex!

676
00:47:01.988 --> 00:47:04.655
It just numbs me out
so I don't think so much!


677
00:47:04.738 --> 00:47:06.238
I'm always in my head!

678
00:47:06.321 --> 00:47:07.405
Rodrigo!

679
00:47:07.488 --> 00:47:08.571
Alex!

680
00:47:11.946 --> 00:47:13.530
- Rodrigo!
- I see him!


681
00:47:15.071 --> 00:47:17.571
I see him! Help, please!

682
00:47:17.655 --> 00:47:18.655
Help!

683
00:47:51.571 --> 00:47:52.655
Oh God.

684
00:48:03.196 --> 00:48:04.946
Shit.

685
00:48:31.863 --> 00:48:32.863
Oh!

686
00:48:44.446 --> 00:48:46.113
Come on, come on, we gotta go!

687
00:51:17.613 --> 00:51:20.696
<i>The Wampus Cats have
their first game in three weeks tonight.</i>


688
00:51:20.780 --> 00:51:23.030
<i>So let's go out
and celebrate the dearly departed</i>


689
00:51:23.113 --> 00:51:26.196
<i>with a little Osborne pride.
Officers will be on hand</i>


690
00:51:26.280 --> 00:51:29.113
<i>to ensure the safety and security
of everyone in attendance.</i>


691
00:51:29.196 --> 00:51:32.696
Whoo!

692
00:51:32.780 --> 00:51:35.738
Everyone's just moved on, I guess.

693
00:51:35.821 --> 00:51:37.863
You're all coming to the game, right?

694
00:51:39.113 --> 00:51:40.488
Sorry about your friend.

695
00:51:43.738 --> 00:51:46.696
Just something I did to honor him.

696
00:51:50.655 --> 00:51:52.738
You don't have anything to say about this?

697
00:51:52.821 --> 00:51:55.446
I'm done talking about
who I think did it.

698
00:51:56.738 --> 00:51:57.738
I know who did it.

699
00:52:03.696 --> 00:52:05.821
And now everyone else does too.

700
00:52:10.405 --> 00:52:11.946
Ohh!

701
00:52:12.030 --> 00:52:15.238
- Why are you even defending him right now?
- I'm not. I just...


702
00:52:15.821 --> 00:52:20.071
I mean, imagine if it were you, or D,
or Zach people were whispering about.


703
00:52:20.155 --> 00:52:24.363
Full comeback!
Who's that? The Wampus Cat!


704
00:52:24.946 --> 00:52:26.571
Makani, you were at the party!

705
00:52:26.655 --> 00:52:28.446
I called him out. He heard me!

706
00:52:28.530 --> 00:52:32.155
Then Rodrigo talked shit,
and within one hour, Rodrigo is just...


707
00:52:32.238 --> 00:52:35.155
I hear you, okay?
I don't know what you want me to say.


708
00:52:35.238 --> 00:52:38.446
- Call the cops if you're so sure.
- They said she has no evidence.


709
00:52:38.530 --> 00:52:41.405
- 'Cause she doesn't.
- Because his brother's the deputy!


710
00:52:43.113 --> 00:52:45.030
The killer used a Taser, babe.

711
00:52:45.113 --> 00:52:46.821
Who uses Tasers? Cops!

712
00:52:46.905 --> 00:52:48.280
And who lives with a cop?

713
00:52:48.363 --> 00:52:52.488
Giving him access to background checks
about everyone in town, including us.


714
00:52:56.113 --> 00:52:58.113
Katie's podcast <i>was</i>anonymous.

715
00:52:58.613 --> 00:53:02.113
Guess who can request
connection logs from ISPs? Piggy pigs.


716
00:53:02.655 --> 00:53:04.738
Makani, you weren't here growing up.

717
00:53:05.780 --> 00:53:08.030
He was a disturbed
kid in a real way.

718
00:53:09.655 --> 00:53:11.455
Do you even know
what happened to his parents?


719
00:53:15.113 --> 00:53:16.988
Whoo! Whoo!

720
00:53:18.238 --> 00:53:19.238
Go, Caleb!

721
00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:20.280
Whoo!

722
00:53:22.238 --> 00:53:24.446
Look at all the team all happy,

723
00:53:24.530 --> 00:53:26.696
so into gays
when they can win football games.


724
00:53:26.780 --> 00:53:28.738
Do you just fucking hate everyone?

725
00:53:47.530 --> 00:53:49.446
Tell me you didn't forget.

726
00:53:49.530 --> 00:53:54.030
- Right. Sleep clinic thing.
- Baby, I don't want you here alone.


727
00:53:54.113 --> 00:53:56.613
You told me you were gonna stay
at Alexandra's tomorrow night.


728
00:53:56.696 --> 00:54:00.071
Yeah, yeah. I, um,
was literally just texting her about it.


729
00:54:00.988 --> 00:54:01.988
Proud of you.

730
00:54:03.196 --> 00:54:06.488
The things I do
to get that infernal bell off my door.


731
00:54:23.988 --> 00:54:24.988
Oh.

732
00:54:25.321 --> 00:54:26.946
You just showed up.

733
00:54:29.196 --> 00:54:31.738
I thought I'd take you
on a trip to the ocean.


734
00:54:32.405 --> 00:54:34.780
Pretty sure that's, like,
a thousand miles away.


735
00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:36.780
Not the one I'm thinking of.

736

Who even smokes cigarettes anymore?

741
00:55:02.196 --> 00:55:05.071
Just nice pretending
to have control over how we die.


742
00:55:27.905 --> 00:55:29.863
I thought you were
taking me to the beach.

743
00:55:29.946 --> 00:55:31.905
Nope, the ocean.

744
00:55:34.196 --> 00:55:35.988
Don't worry. The car's a piece of shit.

745
00:55:39.863 --> 00:55:40.905
- Okay?
- Mm-hmm.


746
00:55:50.821 --> 00:55:52.655
It's not exactly the Pacific but...

747
00:55:54.613 --> 00:55:55.655
the fields.

748
00:56:09.905 --> 00:56:11.363
"Let it be forgotten

749
00:56:13.738 --> 00:56:15.446
As a flower is forgotten,

750
00:56:17.321 --> 00:56:20.071
Forgotten as a fire
That once was singing gold,


751
00:56:22.113 --> 00:56:24.530
Let it be forgotten forever and ever,

752
00:56:26.655 --> 00:56:28.405
Time is a kind friend,

753
00:56:29.446 --> 00:56:30.946
She will make us old."

754
00:56:37.696 --> 00:56:38.821
When'd you write that?

755
00:56:53.321 --> 00:56:54.821
Don't shut me out again.

756
00:56:56.238 --> 00:56:57.321
Stay here.

757
00:56:58.863 --> 00:56:59.946
Like this.

758
00:57:01.363 --> 00:57:05.030
- Good thing I know you're not dangerous.
- I mean, I never said that.


759
00:57:08.530 --> 00:57:11.530
Maybe that's why I brought you
out here in the first place, you know?


760
00:57:13.446 --> 00:57:15.196
Where no one can find us.

761
00:57:17.238 --> 00:57:19.655
Well, you'd have to know my secret first.

762
00:57:19.738 --> 00:57:20.863
You think I don't?

763
00:57:55.113 --> 00:57:57.738
I actually
think you love secrets.


764
00:57:59.405 --> 00:58:02.030
You still won't tell
a single soul about me.


765
00:58:12.280 --> 00:58:13.821
Fucking Chris.

766
00:58:15.655 --> 00:58:18.405
He'll just keep calling
and keep calling, so I'm, uh...


767
00:58:18.488 --> 00:58:20.405
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Sorry.


768
00:58:25.155 --> 00:58:27.280
Hi. What do you want?

769
00:58:30.863 --> 00:58:31.905
Not far.

770
00:58:33.071 --> 00:58:34.071
Yes.

771
00:58:36.113 --> 00:58:37.321
I don't know. Soon.

772
00:58:42.446 --> 00:58:43.488
Okay.

773
00:58:44.030 --> 00:58:45.113
Bye.

774
00:58:49.446 --> 00:58:51.613
He always has to know
where I am all the time.


775
00:58:53.530 --> 00:58:54.821
Did you tell him?

776
00:58:54.905 --> 00:58:55.905
No.

777
00:58:56.946 --> 00:58:59.030
Still thinks he can
be my dad, you know?

778
00:59:05.071 --> 00:59:06.738
You never talk about them,

779
00:59:08.238 --> 00:59:09.238
your parents.

780
00:59:10.946 --> 00:59:12.030
What happened?

781
00:59:17.196 --> 00:59:18.238
Sorry.

782
00:59:18.988 --> 00:59:21.655
We can... we can just go.

783
00:59:23.613 --> 00:59:25.280
They crashed into a tree.

784
00:59:29.363 --> 00:59:30.946
My dad was driving.

785
00:59:32.030 --> 00:59:33.946
It killed him instantly, and, um,

786
00:59:35.780 --> 00:59:40.280
my mom, she, um...
she died in the hospital the next day.


787
00:59:42.196 --> 00:59:44.363
I mean, they were drunks, you know?

788
00:59:44.446 --> 00:59:49.696
Always were, but that part gets,
like, left out conveniently.


789
00:59:50.530 --> 00:59:53.863
But it makes for a better legend,
I guess, when it's some


790
00:59:54.696 --> 00:59:59.196
dramatic double suicide
'cause a kid had behavioral issues.


791
01:00:02.613 --> 01:00:05.530
You know, I just think, like,
when something really terrible happens,


792
01:00:05.613 --> 01:00:08.613
people need someone to blame.

793
01:00:09.988 --> 01:00:12.196
No one probably gets that better than you.

794
01:00:14.405 --> 01:00:17.030
I mean, that's what those poems are about,

795
01:00:18.196 --> 01:00:19.196
right?

796
01:00:19.780 --> 01:00:20.780
What?

797
01:00:21.405 --> 01:00:22.530
Being blamed.

798
01:00:25.571 --> 01:00:27.613
Did you do a background check on me?

799
01:00:31.363 --> 01:00:32.363
Makani.

800
01:00:33.946 --> 01:00:36.030
Makani, wait! Stop!

801
01:00:37.988 --> 01:00:39.071
Makani!

802
01:00:40.571 --> 01:00:42.030
Makani Sun-woo.

803
01:00:43.405 --> 01:00:44.446
I know you.

804
01:00:45.863 --> 01:00:47.405
I know who you are.

805
01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:52.280
What are you gonna do? Hitchhike?

806
01:00:57.321 --> 01:00:58.655
World got you down?

807
01:00:59.780 --> 01:01:00.780
We can talk.

808
01:01:01.863 --> 01:01:02.863
I won't judge.

809
01:01:03.780 --> 01:01:07.655
I am but an observer of human behavior.

810
01:01:09.446 --> 01:01:12.696
You get people alone in a car,
you can learn real quick who <i>they</i> are,


811
01:01:13.738 --> 01:01:16.571
especially when they feel
like you work for 'em.


812
01:01:17.071 --> 01:01:19.571
Like that churchy girl
who got strung up.


813
01:01:19.655 --> 01:01:22.946
Could've told you she was talking
out of both sides of her mouth.


814
01:01:23.446 --> 01:01:25.613
She was a real bitch, that one.

815
01:01:26.321 --> 01:01:27.446
May she rest.

816
01:01:27.946 --> 01:01:28.988
Mmm.

817
01:01:29.988 --> 01:01:32.238
Wasn't too good at hiding it either.

818
01:01:33.530 --> 01:01:34.571
Not like you.

819
01:01:35.196 --> 01:01:36.196
Hmm?

820
01:01:37.363 --> 01:01:39.196
You're a nice girl, aren't you?

821
01:01:41.571 --> 01:01:42.571
Yeah.

822
01:01:42.988 --> 01:01:46.030
It's always nice
to have a nice girl in the car.


823
01:01:53.863 --> 01:01:55.530
Are you here all alone?

824
01:01:56.738 --> 01:01:58.780
No. My parents
just go to bed really early.


825
01:01:59.405 --> 01:02:01.821
- Ah...
- Five stars. Thanks, Dave. See ya.


826
01:02:01.905 --> 01:02:02.905
Yeah.

827
01:02:03.821 --> 01:02:04.863
See you.

828
01:03:06.155 --> 01:03:07.738
Gam?

829
01:03:26.446 --> 01:03:27.964
<i>Not a day goes by</i>

830
01:03:27.988 --> 01:03:29.905
<i>I don't hate myself for it, 
Your Honor.</i>

831
01:03:30.655 --> 01:03:32.196
<i>If I could switch places</i>

832
01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:34.988
<i>and be the one
who went into that fire, I would.</i>


833
01:03:53.196 --> 01:03:54.196
Ollie?

834
01:05:15.655 --> 01:05:16.571
No!

835
01:05:25.946 --> 01:05:27.905
No. No!

836
01:05:51.113 --> 01:05:52.155
Makani?

837
01:05:56.071 --> 01:05:57.863
Makani?

838
01:05:59.530 --> 01:06:01.738
I'm at her house right now. Makani?

839
01:06:02.321 --> 01:06:04.905
Your grandma called. Are you... Jesus!

840
01:06:04.988 --> 01:06:07.821
Yeah, my friend's been attacked.

841
01:06:07.905 --> 01:06:11.145
- <i>Sending a patrol car right away.</i>
- It was Ollie. It was Ollie!


842
01:06:11.696 --> 01:06:12.780
You were right.

843
01:06:12.863 --> 01:06:15.321
They're gonna know.

844
01:06:15.405 --> 01:06:16.946
They're all gonna know.

845
01:06:17.030 --> 01:06:18.030
Know what?

846
01:06:40.988 --> 01:06:41.988
Mmm.

847
01:06:45.530 --> 01:06:46.988
Hey, baby.

848
01:06:49.363 --> 01:06:50.363
What?

849
01:06:51.655 --> 01:06:53.155
He was there.

850
01:06:55.446 --> 01:06:57.405
Gam, he was there. He was there.

851
01:06:57.488 --> 01:06:58.738
They got him, sweetie.

852
01:06:58.821 --> 01:07:00.530
- They found him.
- You're safe.


853
01:07:01.113 --> 01:07:02.113
It's okay.

854
01:07:02.696 --> 01:07:03.696
You're okay.

855
01:07:04.071 --> 01:07:05.363
We're all here.

856
01:07:08.696 --> 01:07:10.071
Did he text everyone?

857
01:07:11.363 --> 01:07:13.155
I stopped reading.

858
01:07:13.238 --> 01:07:17.488
Thought you'd maybe like us
to hear it, you know, from you.


859
01:07:20.780 --> 01:07:23.405
I'm gonna get a coffee.

860
01:07:23.488 --> 01:07:24.696
Give you a few.

861
01:07:37.071 --> 01:07:38.488
<i>Open your eyes.</i>

862
01:07:42.405 --> 01:07:47.238
Okay, bitches. You think
you got what it takes to win State?


863
01:07:47.988 --> 01:07:49.780
'Cause I don't see shit.

864
01:07:51.905 --> 01:07:53.530
What's your name, bitch?

865
01:07:59.696 --> 01:08:02.446
- Hold up. These girls kidnapped you?
- These were your friends?


866
01:08:03.196 --> 01:08:05.571
Sometimes friends, I don't know.

867
01:08:06.488 --> 01:08:09.571
They were seniors.
It was my first year on varsity.


868
01:08:10.155 --> 01:08:12.113
- Varsity what?
- You played sports?


869
01:08:12.196 --> 01:08:14.530
<i>Are you a hungry little bitch?</i>

870
01:08:15.946 --> 01:08:17.030
Cow!

871
01:08:19.446 --> 01:08:21.030
<i>Drink up, bitches!</i>

872
01:08:21.113 --> 01:08:24.946
<i>They were hazing us.
Tried to get us to turn on each other.</i>


873
01:08:25.030 --> 01:08:28.446
- You can do better than that!
<i>- We were out of our minds.</i>


874
01:08:28.530 --> 01:08:30.488
<i>How's that taste, 
Makani, huh?</i>

875
01:08:32.238 --> 01:08:33.613
Hey, Jasmine.

876
01:08:45.738 --> 01:08:46.738
I just...

877
01:08:48.696 --> 01:08:49.696
pushed.

878
01:08:51.196 --> 01:08:55.613
Jasmine survived, but there were burns.

879
01:08:57.363 --> 01:08:59.030
Her face was, um...

880
01:09:02.988 --> 01:09:06.113
I got charged and went to trial.

881
01:09:08.238 --> 01:09:11.113
Even after I was acquitted,
I still got threats


882
01:09:12.113 --> 01:09:13.113
daily.

883
01:09:15.446 --> 01:09:17.238
My parents blamed each other.

884
01:09:18.113 --> 01:09:21.280
They'd been looking
for a reason to break up anyway.


885
01:09:25.738 --> 01:09:30.196
I was so ashamed of myself.

886
01:09:32.405 --> 01:09:33.863
So I moved here.

887
01:09:36.155 --> 01:09:39.530
Took my mom's maiden name and just...

888
01:09:40.571 --> 01:09:43.405
...tried to become
a different person.


889
01:09:43.488 --> 01:09:44.863
You <i>are</i> a different person.

890
01:09:45.530 --> 01:09:47.863
I've never met
the person you're talking about.


891
01:09:48.488 --> 01:09:52.113
You bring me doughnuts
because you know they soothe me.


892
01:09:52.738 --> 01:09:56.946
You proofread my essays.
You stand up for me in public.


893
01:09:57.030 --> 01:09:58.613
That's who you are.

894
01:09:59.821 --> 01:10:03.155
I mean, you gave Ollie Larsson
the benefit of the doubt.


895
01:10:03.238 --> 01:10:04.571
And he's a murderer.

896
01:10:04.655 --> 01:10:07.780
Yeah, you gave a fucking murderer
the chance to show he's decent.


897
01:10:11.946 --> 01:10:14.446
To no more secrets between friends.

898
01:10:14.530 --> 01:10:16.770
It's a fucking hospital, Zach!
Wait till we get her home!


899
01:10:16.821 --> 01:10:20.613
I'm not saying that we have to smoke it.
It... it's symbolic.


900
01:10:21.738 --> 01:10:23.488
I'm not really good with hugs.

901
01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:28.155
Come on.

902
01:10:37.780 --> 01:10:40.946
<i>KRDY News has learned
that the Sloan County sheriffs</i>


903
01:10:41.030 --> 01:10:42.155
<i>have made an arrest,</i>

904
01:10:42.238 --> 01:10:44.988
<i>and suspect Oliver Larsson is in custody.</i>

905
01:10:45.071 --> 01:10:47.905
<i>A sense of calm has returned
to this small Nebraska town,</i>


906
01:10:47.988 --> 01:10:51.696
<i>and plans to move forward
with the Corn in the USA Festival next...</i>


907
01:11:31.988 --> 01:11:35.655
This year, the Fall Harvest
Festival should be a celebration.


908
01:11:35.738 --> 01:11:38.780
People here, they have
a right to feel safe, protected,


909
01:11:38.863 --> 01:11:44.030
and our little police force, good men all,
but they are sadly undermanned.


910
01:11:44.113 --> 01:11:47.030
That's why
Sandford Family Farms has stepped in.


911
01:11:47.113 --> 01:11:48.988
We've hired private security,

912
01:11:49.071 --> 01:11:50.655
free of charge.

913
01:11:50.738 --> 01:11:52.155
Our little gift.

914
01:11:52.238 --> 01:11:53.363
These men are here

915
01:11:53.446 --> 01:11:56.780
so people can enjoy themselves
and these fine festivities.


916
01:11:57.613 --> 01:12:02.363
Nothing, absolutely nothing's
gonna stop this proud corn town


917
01:12:02.446 --> 01:12:04.446
from shucking the events of the past

918
01:12:04.530 --> 01:12:08.696
and buttering itself up
for another great year to come.


919
01:12:11.655 --> 01:12:15.780
Um, yeah, but I... I thought...
I thought Zach was picking you up?


920
01:12:15.863 --> 01:12:19.571
<i>Fuck. I forgot to tell you.
His dad's making him work the corn maze.</i>


921
01:12:19.655 --> 01:12:23.155
<i>- Can't you just take the bus?</i>
- Oh shit. Alex, they all just left.


922
01:12:23.238 --> 01:12:25.363
<i>All right, we'll turn around.
We're not far.</i>


923
01:12:25.446 --> 01:12:27.696
<i>- You good there by yourself?</i>
- Yeah, I'll wait.


924
01:13:07.696 --> 01:13:10.446
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

925
01:13:10.530 --> 01:13:13.988
Yeah, um, I'm at the high school.
My name is Makani Young.


926
01:13:14.071 --> 01:13:16.363
<i>Okay, tell me your emergency.</i>

927
01:13:17.405 --> 01:13:20.280
<i>Makani? Can you tell me what's happening?</i>

928
01:13:20.863 --> 01:13:22.280
<i>Hello?</i>

929
01:13:23.738 --> 01:13:25.321
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

930
01:13:25.405 --> 01:13:27.196
Makani! It's me! Hey!

931
01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:30.821
- Caleb. Thank God.
- Um, good to see you too.


932
01:13:30.905 --> 01:13:33.155
Everyone's outside. Are you...

933
01:14:08.988 --> 01:14:11.238
Makani!

934
01:14:21.405 --> 01:14:22.405
You okay?

935
01:14:30.780 --> 01:14:31.946
Shh.

936
01:14:41.405 --> 01:14:42.738
Hi. Yes.

937
01:14:42.821 --> 01:14:46.196
We need an ambulance at Osborne High.
Someone's been stabbed.


938
01:14:46.863 --> 01:14:47.988
In the stomach.

939
01:14:48.571 --> 01:14:49.571
Makani!

940
01:15:00.863 --> 01:15:02.030
The corn maze.

941
01:15:40.030 --> 01:15:41.738
Pick up the phone, Zach.

942
01:15:41.821 --> 01:15:43.988
Thank you. Thank... thank you so much.

943
01:15:45.030 --> 01:15:46.113
Caleb's okay.

944
01:15:47.238 --> 01:15:49.946
Hospital says he's...
he's critical, but he's stable.


945
01:15:50.905 --> 01:15:52.321
I just hope Zach's okay.

946
01:15:53.321 --> 01:15:56.988
- Whose farms did his dad buy out?
- I mean, pretty much everyone's.


947
01:15:57.488 --> 01:15:59.905
Jackson's, Macon's.

948
01:15:59.988 --> 01:16:02.530
Everyone in Osborne
either works for him or hates him.


949
01:16:02.613 --> 01:16:05.155
- Don't forget Sheriff Adkins.
- What?


950
01:16:05.238 --> 01:16:07.780
Yeah, the sheriff's broke,
had to sell his land.


951
01:16:08.363 --> 01:16:11.696
And now Zach's dad's
trying to replace the cops.


952
01:16:28.405 --> 01:16:30.613
I don't even know where to start. I...

953
01:16:31.738 --> 01:16:35.155
I've been so beyond terrible to you.

954
01:16:38.863 --> 01:16:39.863
Guys, what is that?

955
01:16:42.030 --> 01:16:43.780
Shit.

956
01:16:43.863 --> 01:16:44.863
It's Zach.

957
01:16:44.905 --> 01:16:46.363
<i>- Guys! Hello?</i>
- Zach!


958
01:16:46.446 --> 01:16:48.488
- Are you okay?
<i>- Everything's on fire!</i>


959
01:16:48.571 --> 01:16:50.321
<i>My dad's inside! I have to find him!</i>

960
01:16:50.405 --> 01:16:51.530
- What?
<i>- Please!</i>


961
01:16:53.155 --> 01:16:54.155
What?

962
01:17:21.696 --> 01:17:24.280
Ollie, you said
this car's a piece of shit, right?


963
01:17:25.030 --> 01:17:27.530
Wait, what's the car
got to do with it?

964
01:17:28.488 --> 01:17:29.988
Oh fuck, are you serious?

965
01:17:30.571 --> 01:17:33.946
We have to try to help. Zach and half
of our class are in that maze right now.


966
01:17:34.030 --> 01:17:36.113
If we clear a
path, they can get out.

967
01:17:36.196 --> 01:17:38.946
All right! All right!

968
01:17:39.863 --> 01:17:41.946
Okay. Let's go save
the goddamn football team!


969
01:17:42.030 --> 01:17:44.196
Oh, shit!

970
01:18:02.113 --> 01:18:03.113
Hey, Jasmine.

971
01:18:13.155 --> 01:18:14.696
Shit. Get out! Get out!

972
01:18:15.738 --> 01:18:16.738
Fuck!

973
01:18:23.821 --> 01:18:24.863
- What?
- Shit.


974
01:18:24.946 --> 01:18:25.946
Wait, wait!

975
01:18:47.821 --> 01:18:50.405
Oh my God!

976
01:18:50.488 --> 01:18:52.071
Oh my... oh my God!

977
01:18:52.155 --> 01:18:53.155
Oh my God!

978
01:18:53.238 --> 01:18:54.363
Zach!

979
01:18:54.863 --> 01:18:57.030
I can't breathe!

980
01:18:58.488 --> 01:19:00.738
Who's that?
Who's... I can't see shit!


981
01:19:00.821 --> 01:19:03.071
- Hey.
- Wait up for the rest of them!


982
01:19:03.696 --> 01:19:05.530
Hey! How do we get out of here?

983
01:19:05.613 --> 01:19:07.253
We got you! We
got you! Go! Hurry! Hurry!

984
01:19:07.321 --> 01:19:09.488
We got you! Go! Yes,
we know! We know! Go!

985
01:19:09.571 --> 01:19:10.780
- Okay, go.
- Get them out.


986
01:19:10.863 --> 01:19:12.655
- No! We're going with you!
- No, go!


987
01:19:13.405 --> 01:19:15.196
- You gotta help them!
- Makani.


988
01:19:16.238 --> 01:19:17.613
We have to go find Zach.

989
01:19:17.696 --> 01:19:19.821
Go! You know the way out.

990
01:19:19.905 --> 01:19:21.113
- Help them.
- Come on!


991
01:19:22.321 --> 01:19:23.405
Zach!

992
01:19:24.655 --> 01:19:25.988
Zach!

993
01:19:27.946 --> 01:19:29.363
- Shit.
- Oh shit!


994
01:19:32.113 --> 01:19:33.113
Zach!

995
01:19:33.530 --> 01:19:34.613
Zach!

996
01:19:36.738 --> 01:19:40.113
You don't have to do this!
These people have families!


997
01:19:41.738 --> 01:19:43.446
I have a family!

998
01:19:44.613 --> 01:19:47.196
- Please!
- Hey, asshole!


999
01:20:13.280 --> 01:20:14.488
Damn it!

1000
01:20:17.613 --> 01:20:19.113
Do you know how many times...

1001
01:20:22.571 --> 01:20:25.363
Do you know how many times
I've dreamt of that moment?


1002
01:20:25.446 --> 01:20:26.988
Zach!

1003
01:20:27.071 --> 01:20:29.405
You only get to kill your dad once!

1004
01:20:29.488 --> 01:20:30.655
Jesus.

1005
01:20:30.738 --> 01:20:32.738
I had the perfect thing to say

1006
01:20:34.155 --> 01:20:35.238
to his face.

1007
01:20:37.071 --> 01:20:38.280
What's wrong?

1008
01:20:39.071 --> 01:20:42.613
Second-guessing giving me
<i>The Art of War</i> on my ninth birthday?


1009
01:20:46.696 --> 01:20:48.946
See? Now... now it just sounds stupid.

1010
01:20:49.530 --> 01:20:51.738
He was supposed to be crying and...

1011
01:20:51.821 --> 01:20:55.363
and... and aware of his life choices
and consequences and...


1012
01:20:55.988 --> 01:20:56.905
Fuck!

1013
01:20:56.988 --> 01:20:58.530
Fuckin' sociopath.

1014
01:20:59.405 --> 01:21:00.905
Shit.

1015
01:21:01.530 --> 01:21:03.280
No! Oh no!

1016
01:21:03.363 --> 01:21:05.446
I am not a sociopath!

1017
01:21:08.655 --> 01:21:11.155
Does no one know
what that word means anymore?


1018
01:21:11.946 --> 01:21:16.738
If I were a sociopath, I'd have
zero emotional investment in the outcome!


1019
01:21:16.821 --> 01:21:17.655
Ollie!

1020
01:21:17.738 --> 01:21:20.863
<i>This,</i> this is <i>very</i> important to me.

1021
01:21:20.946 --> 01:21:24.738
And... and not to mention
extremely work-intensive.


1022
01:21:24.821 --> 01:21:28.696
Do you know how hard it is
to make these <i>fucking</i> masks?


1023
01:21:28.780 --> 01:21:31.196
Zach, stop, please!
Look, this... this isn't you!


1024
01:21:31.280 --> 01:21:33.446
You have no idea who I am!

1025
01:21:34.030 --> 01:21:35.738
You don't even know who<i>you</i> are!

1026
01:21:36.238 --> 01:21:40.155
I've spent my whole
life denying who I am.

1027
01:21:40.238 --> 01:21:43.821
I was ashamed, but why?
Because I was born with privilege?


1028
01:21:43.905 --> 01:21:45.988
Why should I feel bad about that?

1029
01:21:46.738 --> 01:21:49.488
It's not <i>my</i> fault. 
It's what I was given.

1030
01:21:50.488 --> 01:21:55.196
Do you see now?
You're all wearing masks, Makani Sun-woo.


1031
01:21:55.821 --> 01:21:59.196
You're all putting on
these... these fake faces.


1032
01:21:59.863 --> 01:22:03.238
You're all hypocrites! 
Just like my dad.

1033
01:22:03.321 --> 01:22:07.488
But I... I can't hide
from my dad's last name.


1034
01:22:08.071 --> 01:22:12.530
So I... I'm... I'm showing
these people who they are!


1035
01:22:12.613 --> 01:22:14.071
Who they <i>really</i>are!

1036
01:22:15.696 --> 01:22:18.530
Take one more fucking step,
and I swear to God, I will...


1037
01:22:18.613 --> 01:22:19.946
What? What?

1038
01:22:20.530 --> 01:22:22.238
You'll push <i>me</i> into the fire?

1039
01:22:22.946 --> 01:22:26.905
Stab me with the same knife you used
on Caleb? On Jackson and Katie?


1040
01:22:27.446 --> 01:22:30.113
The same knife you used
to slit Rodrigo's throat?


1041
01:22:31.113 --> 01:22:33.030
<i>You</i> killed my dad.

1042
01:22:33.113 --> 01:22:34.946
<i>You</i> killed Ollie.

1043
01:22:35.988 --> 01:22:37.821
That's why I had to protect myself

1044
01:22:38.821 --> 01:22:40.238
by killing you.

1045
01:22:42.821 --> 01:22:44.196
But hey, it... it tracks.

1046
01:22:45.196 --> 01:22:47.488
More fire, more victims.

1047
01:22:48.113 --> 01:22:49.488
So you.

1048
01:22:50.446 --> 01:22:52.446
I mean, cops show up.

1049
01:22:52.530 --> 01:22:55.780
They find the knife,
and they find you dead.


1050
01:22:56.363 --> 01:22:58.238
I could just put this all on you.

1051
01:22:59.405 --> 01:23:01.155
No one would ever know.

1052
01:23:02.071 --> 01:23:03.238
I'll know.

1053
01:23:10.238 --> 01:23:13.196
You think having everything
makes you the victim?


1054
01:23:13.280 --> 01:23:15.780
What kind of fucked-up logic is that?

1055
01:23:15.863 --> 01:23:18.196
Blaming everyone else for what's wrong?

1056
01:23:18.280 --> 01:23:20.571
When you're what's wrong, Zach.

1057
01:23:21.155 --> 01:23:22.696
You're the problem!

1058
01:23:24.530 --> 01:23:26.030
Look at me, Zach.

1059
01:23:26.113 --> 01:23:28.196
Look at my face!

1060
01:23:30.780 --> 01:23:33.821
I don't have to wear a mask
to show you who you are.


1061
01:23:52.988 --> 01:23:54.113
Ollie!

1062
01:23:57.821 --> 01:23:58.863
Ollie, no.

1063
01:24:01.738 --> 01:24:03.113
"Hey, Ollie."

1064
01:24:05.196 --> 01:24:06.863
"Hey, Makani."

1065
01:24:08.363 --> 01:24:11.030
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

1066
01:24:12.030 --> 01:24:14.321
Hey, stay with me, Ollie.

1067
01:24:14.405 --> 01:24:15.530
Stay with me.

1068

Help is coming, okay?

1069
01:24:18.905 --> 01:24:20.113
