over to one of you.

Random at first, but once
you start working with a customer,


151
00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:35.608
they'll continue to be routed over to you
for the sake of continuity.

figure out the answer,

00:09:43.158 --> 00:09:44.909
- [chuckles] Uh, yeah.
- Cool.


156
00:09:44.993 --> 00:09:47.704
So let's say you've answered
a client's question,


157
00:09:47.787 --> 00:09:48.955
and they seem satisfied.

158
00:09:49.039 --> 00:09:51.600
Now, it's not just that you get a smile
or a frown, though that is part of it.


159
00:09:51.624 --> 00:09:54.085
You get your smile...
it's almost always a smile.


160
00:09:54.169 --> 00:09:56.671
Um, that is when you send the survey.

161
00:09:56.755 --> 00:10:00.175
The survey is a set of quick questions
about, you know, your overall service,


162
00:10:00.258 --> 00:10:03.428
how you did,
and they send that immediately back,


163
00:10:03.511 --> 00:10:06.657
and you get to see how you did right here.
That is the rating. Uh, you know what?


164
00:10:06.681 --> 00:10:07.974
Let's just do a live one.

165
00:10:09.142 --> 00:10:10.685
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.


166
00:10:10.769 --> 00:10:13.438
- Okay.
- [types]


167
00:10:13.521 --> 00:10:15.774
- Have a nice day.
- [beeps]


168
00:10:15.857 --> 00:10:17.233
[taps]

169
00:10:17.317 --> 00:10:18.860
- [humming]
- [beeps]


170
00:10:18.943 --> 00:10:20.445
That's pretty good, 99 is good,

171
00:10:20.528 --> 00:10:24.532
but I can't help wondering
why it wasn't 100. Let's look.


172
00:10:24.616 --> 00:10:25.617
[beeps]

173
00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:27.368
Okay.

174
00:10:27.452 --> 00:10:28.578
[types]

175
00:10:31.247 --> 00:10:34.647
Boom. Sometimes you just encounter someone
who isn't really sensitive to the metrics.


176
00:10:34.709 --> 00:10:38.463
So it's important to ask them
and make sure you get that clarity.


177
00:10:38.546 --> 00:10:42.133
And we're back to a perfect score, yeah.

178
00:10:42.217 --> 00:10:44.177
- Oh, wow.
- [both chuckling]


179
00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.471
All right, are you ready to do this
on your own?


180
00:10:46.554 --> 00:10:47.764
- [chuckles] Yes.
- Awesome.


181
00:10:47.847 --> 00:10:50.517
[typing]

182
00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:51.684
[beeps]

183
00:11:34.853 --> 00:11:36.413
[Annie] Excuse me. 
I'm terribly sorry.

184
00:11:37.397 --> 00:11:38.398
Hey, how's it going?

185
00:11:38.481 --> 00:11:40.209
- I thought you were in Amsterdam.
- Oh, just for a day.


186
00:11:40.233 --> 00:11:41.752
Then London, then New York, now here.

187
00:11:41.776 --> 00:11:43.987
- Have you slept?
- A few hours on the plane.


188
00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:46.364
A couple pills, I'm good.
So you? First week.


189
00:11:46.447 --> 00:11:48.491
- [groans]
- What?


190
00:11:48.575 --> 00:11:49.659
You got an 87 average.

191
00:11:49.742 --> 00:11:52.036
- That's like a solid B.
- How long till I'm fired?


192
00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:54.139
Listen, when I first started,
it took me a few weeks


193
00:11:54.163 --> 00:11:55.724
to really get the hang of it.
Believe me, okay?


194
00:11:55.748 --> 00:11:57.959
Believe me, you're doing fine.
You're good, all right?


195
00:11:58.042 --> 00:11:59.043
Mm-hm.

196
00:11:59.127 --> 00:12:00.211
Hello, I'm Eamon Bailey.

197
00:12:00.295 --> 00:12:03.381
[audience cheering]

198
00:12:03.464 --> 00:12:04.799
[chuckles] Hey.

199
00:12:04.883 --> 00:12:06.593
[applause continues]

200
00:12:08.595 --> 00:12:11.639
Thank you, thank you.
So glad to see you all here.


201
00:12:11.723 --> 00:12:15.226
Now a bunch of you are new
to the company since I last spoke,


202
00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:17.437
so can the guppies all stand up?

203
00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:20.690
- [Annie] Right, that's you.
- [Eamon] Come on, guppies, just stand up.


204
00:12:20.773 --> 00:12:22.213
- Whoo!
- Guppies, stand up, come on.


205
00:12:23.526 --> 00:12:25.069
Congratulations, nice to have you.

206
00:12:25.153 --> 00:12:29.866
Now "guppies" is just an affectionate term
for you baby fishies.


207
00:12:29.949 --> 00:12:32.785
Soon you will all grow
to become powerful...


208
00:12:32.869 --> 00:12:35.288
- [laughs] You're adorable.
- I hate you.


209
00:12:35.371 --> 00:12:38.333
...the fish that guppies grow up
into being...


210
00:12:38.416 --> 00:12:40.543
- What do they grow up into?
- [laughter]


211
00:12:40.627 --> 00:12:42.587
Anyway, all right, this is Dream Friday,

212
00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:46.466
the latest in our long tradition
of presenting our newest innovations.


213
00:12:46.549 --> 00:12:49.552
The first Dream Friday
featured Ty Lafitte,


214
00:12:49.636 --> 00:12:52.180
the inventor of True You
and our founding father.


215
00:12:52.263 --> 00:12:55.683
And usually, we feature one
of our engineers or our visionaries


216
00:12:55.767 --> 00:12:58.353
but today unfortunately,
it's just me and for that,


217
00:12:58.436 --> 00:13:00.021
- I apologize in advance.
- [laughter]


218
00:13:00.104 --> 00:13:01.874
- [Annie chuckles]
- [man] We love you, Eamon!


219
00:13:01.898 --> 00:13:03.066
Thanks, Mom.

220
00:13:03.149 --> 00:13:05.443
[laughter]

221
00:13:05.526 --> 00:13:07.087
Now you might not have seen me
around campus


222
00:13:07.111 --> 00:13:08.672
for the last few days,
and maybe you were wondering


223
00:13:08.696 --> 00:13:10.156
just where the heck I've been.

224
00:13:10.239 --> 00:13:11.366
[woman] Surfing!

225
00:13:11.449 --> 00:13:13.201
- [laughter]
- Argh!


226
00:13:13.284 --> 00:13:16.663
- [giggles]
- You got me! Yes, I've been surfing.


227
00:13:16.746 --> 00:13:19.082
And that's part
of what I'm here to talk about.


228
00:13:19.165 --> 00:13:21.501
I love to surf and in the past,

229
00:13:21.584 --> 00:13:26.255
I would have to wake up
and call the local surf shop


230
00:13:26.339 --> 00:13:29.509
to ask about the local breaks,
and pretty soon,


231
00:13:29.592 --> 00:13:32.804
the local surf shop
stopped answering their phone.


232
00:13:32.887 --> 00:13:37.058
- [laughter]
- And then I got a cell phone,


233
00:13:37.141 --> 00:13:39.811
and I could call up my buddies
who were already out


234
00:13:39.894 --> 00:13:42.063
at the beach before me,
and I could ask them,


235
00:13:42.146 --> 00:13:45.483
but they, too,
stopped answering their phones.


236
00:13:45.566 --> 00:13:46.484
[laughter]

237
00:13:46.567 --> 00:13:47.986
And then came...

238
00:13:49.028 --> 00:13:50.029
the Internet.

239
00:13:50.113 --> 00:13:53.032
- [audience cheering]
- Whoa. Oh!


240
00:13:53.116 --> 00:13:57.036
Some geniuses set up cameras
on the beaches,


241
00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:00.707
so I could log on
and get some very crude images


242
00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:02.792
of the waves at Stinson Beach.

243
00:14:02.875 --> 00:14:06.587
It was almost worse
than calling the surf shop.


244
00:14:06.671 --> 00:14:08.464
Here's how it used to look.

245
00:14:08.548 --> 00:14:09.966
[audience groaning]

246
00:14:10.049 --> 00:14:12.218
Almost useless, right?

247
00:14:12.301 --> 00:14:14.512
But now let's refresh that page

248
00:14:14.595 --> 00:14:18.641
and show the site
with our new Circle video delivery.


249
00:14:19.809 --> 00:14:22.687
- [audience murmuring]
- Now that looks pretty good, doesn't it?


250
00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:24.772
Yeah, maybe I should be
out there right now.


251
00:14:24.856 --> 00:14:27.191
- [audience chuckling]
- But would it surprise you to know


252
00:14:27.275 --> 00:14:31.571
that this is not coming
from some big camera


253
00:14:31.654 --> 00:14:34.741
but actually just one of these?

254
00:14:34.824 --> 00:14:36.034
[audience gasping]

255
00:14:36.117 --> 00:14:39.746
This camera needs no wires.

256
00:14:39.829 --> 00:14:43.541
It transmits this image via satellite.

257
00:14:43.624 --> 00:14:45.793
I set up that camera this morning.

258
00:14:45.877 --> 00:14:49.672
I stuck it to a tree near the dunes
with no permit, nothing,


259
00:14:49.756 --> 00:14:51.924
in fact, no one even knows it's there.

260
00:14:52.008 --> 00:14:53.926
And actually,
I was pretty busy this morning


261
00:14:54.010 --> 00:14:58.598
because here's Rodeo Beach,
Montera,


262
00:14:58.681 --> 00:15:00.892
Ocean Beach,

263
00:15:00.975 --> 00:15:02.477
Fort Point.

264
00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:03.644
This is my front yard.

265
00:15:03.728 --> 00:15:04.896
[laughter]

266
00:15:04.979 --> 00:15:07.231
- And here's my backyard.
- [laughter]


267
00:15:07.315 --> 00:15:08.483
Here's traffic on the 101.

268
00:15:08.566 --> 00:15:10.693
Oh, did you think
this was just a camera?

269
00:15:10.777 --> 00:15:13.946
No, welcome
to real time analytic processing.


270
00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:17.700
When you see this,
you're also getting this.


271
00:15:18.785 --> 00:15:20.495
[audience murmuring]

272
00:15:20.578 --> 00:15:23.831
Air quality, traffic volume,
weather patterns, biometrics,


273
00:15:23.915 --> 00:15:28.920
facial recognition, saved and searchable,
all to serve you better.


274
00:15:29.003 --> 00:15:34.133
My friends, we are looking
at retailing these in just a few months


275
00:15:34.217 --> 00:15:36.636
for less than a pair of jeans.

276
00:15:36.719 --> 00:15:39.764
- [audience murmurs]
- And I'm not talking about fancy jeans.


277
00:15:39.847 --> 00:15:42.642
I'm talking about the ones
like I'm wearing.


278
00:15:42.725 --> 00:15:43.768
[woman] Wow!

279
00:15:43.851 --> 00:15:48.648
Now, Circlers... do you like to share?

280
00:15:48.731 --> 00:15:50.441
[all] Sharing is caring!

281
00:15:50.525 --> 00:15:53.361
Sharing is caring.
I thought you might say that.


282
00:15:53.444 --> 00:15:54.922
- Sharing is caring?
- Sharing is caring.


283
00:15:54.946 --> 00:16:00.159
I have a dozen helpers all over the world
right now carrying these cameras.


284
00:16:00.243 --> 00:16:03.037
Imagine the human rights implications.

285
00:16:03.121 --> 00:16:07.417
Activists no longer have
to hold up a camera.


286
00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:10.420
Now it's as easy as
gluing a camera to a wall,


287
00:16:10.503 --> 00:16:13.089
and actually, we've done just that.

288
00:16:14.424 --> 00:16:15.925
Do you see any cameras here?

289
00:16:16.968 --> 00:16:18.094
No.

290
00:16:18.177 --> 00:16:23.641
We have 144 cameras in place here,
and it took us just a day to do it,


291
00:16:23.724 --> 00:16:25.059
and they're virtually invisible.

292
00:16:25.143 --> 00:16:29.063
They come in every color,
so camouflaging is a cinch.


293
00:16:29.147 --> 00:16:31.315
This is my favorite. Whoa!

294
00:16:31.399 --> 00:16:33.609
- [laughs]
- Nice catch.


295
00:16:33.693 --> 00:16:34.986
Sign her up.

296
00:16:35.069 --> 00:16:39.866
- [laughter]
- So now, the entire world is watching.


297
00:16:39.949 --> 00:16:41.534
You know, I agree with the Hague,

298
00:16:41.617 --> 00:16:44.328
with the human rights activists
all over the world.


299
00:16:44.412 --> 00:16:46.372
There needs to be accountability.

300
00:16:46.456 --> 00:16:50.251
Tyrants and terrorists can no longer hide.

301
00:16:50.334 --> 00:16:55.298
We will see them. We will hear them.
We will hear and see everything.


302
00:16:55.381 --> 00:16:57.800
If it happens, we'll know.

303
00:16:59.427 --> 00:17:03.097
We're calling it... SeeChange.

304
00:17:03.181 --> 00:17:05.141
[applause]

305
00:17:05.224 --> 00:17:07.560
SeeChange.

306
00:17:07.643 --> 00:17:09.812
[audience cheering]

307
00:17:09.896 --> 00:17:12.315

00:25:31.772 --> 00:25:34.400
- citing antitrust laws, right?
- Give me a break, Mercer.


462
00:25:34.483 --> 00:25:36.860
Don't you have to go
and chop some wood or something?


463
00:25:38.904 --> 00:25:39.904
[scoffs]

464
00:25:41.907 --> 00:25:43.492
- Thanks, hon.
- Sure, Dad.


465
00:25:45.577 --> 00:25:47.287
His business is doing well.

466
00:25:47.371 --> 00:25:50.791
Mercer? The antler chandeliers?

467
00:25:50.874 --> 00:25:53.252
They are beautiful, Mae.
He's making one for us.


468
00:25:53.335 --> 00:25:57.464
Did I tell you I'm up to an 87 so far?
They say that's pretty good for a guppy.


469
00:25:58.882 --> 00:26:00.634
- [chuckles]
- Who's a guppy?


470
00:26:00.718 --> 00:26:02.428
[Mom] Well, that's great, Mae.

471
00:26:05.139 --> 00:26:07.391
- Honey?
- [Mom] Hm?


472
00:26:07.474 --> 00:26:10.310
Oh. Come on,
we'll go in the house, come on.


473
00:26:10.394 --> 00:26:12.271
Dad? Don't worry.

474
00:26:12.354 --> 00:26:14.207
- What happened?
- Please, Mae, let your mother.


475
00:26:14.231 --> 00:26:15.232
Honey, just, just...

476
00:26:15.315 --> 00:26:17.001
Just tell everybody
that Dad's not feeling well,


477
00:26:17.025 --> 00:26:19.903
and they'll understand, really.
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.


478
00:26:19.987 --> 00:26:22.114
- [grunts]
- [Mom] It's okay.


479
00:26:22.197 --> 00:26:23.699
Dad.

480
00:26:23.782 --> 00:26:25.743
Please, Mae.

481
00:26:25.826 --> 00:26:28.120
- [exhales]
- We got it.


482
00:26:29.163 --> 00:26:30.330
[Mom] It's okay.

483
00:26:32.082 --> 00:26:33.292
- Come on.
- [Dad sighs]


484
00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:42.009
[birds squawking]

485
00:26:56.064 --> 00:26:57.316
[sighs]

486
00:27:02.946 --> 00:27:05.449
[sobs]

487
00:27:20.339 --> 00:27:21.339
[Mae] Thanks.

488
00:27:27.221 --> 00:27:28.388
[woman] See you soon, Mae.

489
00:27:29.681 --> 00:27:30.682
Bye.

490
00:27:33.644 --> 00:27:36.146
[indistinct chattering]

491
00:27:46.323 --> 00:27:48.742
[indistinct chatter continues]

492
00:27:52.538 --> 00:27:56.458
[woman] <i>Today, I call upon</i>
<i>the Senate Antitrust Subcommittee</i>


493
00:27:56.542 --> 00:27:58.335
<i>to investigate the Circle.</i>

494
00:27:58.418 --> 00:28:02.673
<i>We cannot rely on them to say,
"We're not violating antitrust laws."</i>


495
00:28:02.756 --> 00:28:05.926
<i>I'm sure the Circle
will be glad to cooperate.</i>


496
00:28:06.009 --> 00:28:09.847
<i>We have every confidence
that Senator Williamson's allegations</i>


497
00:28:09.930 --> 00:28:10.931
<i>will be discredited.</i>

498
00:28:11.014 --> 00:28:13.392
You are probably wondering
about your new screen.


499
00:28:13.475 --> 00:28:15.227
- [chuckles]
- Hi, I'm Gina.


500
00:28:15.310 --> 00:28:16.603
- I'm Matt.
- Hi.


501
00:28:16.687 --> 00:28:19.648
Dan said this would be a good moment
to set up all your socials.


502
00:28:19.731 --> 00:28:21.149
- Do you have time?
- Sure.


503
00:28:21.233 --> 00:28:22.234
[Matt] Great.

504
00:28:22.317 --> 00:28:26.655
I take it last week you were too busy
to set up your company social account,


505
00:28:26.738 --> 00:28:29.074
and I don't think
you've imported your old profile.


506
00:28:29.157 --> 00:28:31.368
Sorry, I've just been
kind of overwhelmed so far.


507
00:28:31.451 --> 00:28:33.245
- Oh.
- No, in a good way.


508
00:28:33.328 --> 00:28:37.165
I just haven't had time yet
for extracurricular stuff.


509
00:28:37.249 --> 00:28:38.667
Wow.

510
00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:40.836
That's so interesting you put it that way.

511
00:28:40.919 --> 00:28:43.881
We actually see your profile
and the activity on it


512
00:28:43.964 --> 00:28:48.051
as integral to your participation here.
This is how your coworkers,


513
00:28:48.135 --> 00:28:51.597
even the ones on the other side of campus,
know who you are.


514
00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:55.017
Communication certainly
isn't extracurricular, right?


515
00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:56.935
Right. Of course.

516
00:28:57.019 --> 00:29:01.398
We consider you a full knowable person
of unlimited potential


517
00:29:01.481 --> 00:29:03.609
and a crucial member of the community.

518
00:29:03.692 --> 00:29:06.320
But you're such an enigma.

519
00:29:06.403 --> 00:29:07.404
I am?

520
00:29:07.487 --> 00:29:11.158
It's been years since someone
so shrouded in mystery started here.


521
00:29:11.241 --> 00:29:13.869
- Everyone really likes you.
- Your work's been exemplary.


522
00:29:13.952 --> 00:29:16.079
Strong ratings for your first week.

523
00:29:16.163 --> 00:29:18.498
Are you satisfied with your performance?

524
00:29:18.582 --> 00:29:21.084
Uh, I think I can do better.

525
00:29:21.168 --> 00:29:23.837
Good, but it's not all about work, okay?

526
00:29:23.921 --> 00:29:26.882
- It's all also about community.
- Of course.


527
00:29:26.965 --> 00:29:29.384
It's all connected.

528
00:29:30.385 --> 00:29:34.139
But you've had a blip or two when it comes
to meshing with the community,


529
00:29:34.223 --> 00:29:37.601
like your absence at several weekend
or evening events.


530
00:29:37.684 --> 00:29:40.020
Which are, of course, optional.

531
00:29:40.103 --> 00:29:42.123
- I'm sorry?
- [Gina] Let's start with this weekend.


532
00:29:42.147 --> 00:29:48.445
You left campus at 11:42 p.m. on Friday
and got back 8:46 a.m., Monday.


533
00:29:48.528 --> 00:29:50.030
Was there work on the weekend?

534
00:29:50.113 --> 00:29:51.657
- Oh, no, no!
- I didn't... I'm sorry.


535
00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:52.574
Oh, so sweet.

536
00:29:52.658 --> 00:29:54.378
There wasn't mandatory work
on the weekend.


537
00:29:54.409 --> 00:29:57.996
This isn't like a clock in,
clock out type place, thank God!


538
00:29:58.080 --> 00:29:59.891
But, you know,
there were thousands of people here


539
00:29:59.915 --> 00:30:01.809
participating in a hundred
different activities.


540
00:30:01.833 --> 00:30:02.833
So many.

541
00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:07.005
I'm sorry, I, um...

542
00:30:07.089 --> 00:30:11.051
My dad had an... an episode,
and I was home helping out with that.


543
00:30:11.134 --> 00:30:13.804
I'm so sorry to hear that.
Is that related to his MS?


544
00:30:15.514 --> 00:30:18.225
Uh... yeah.

545
00:30:18.308 --> 00:30:20.068
We didn't know anything
about this incident.


546
00:30:20.143 --> 00:30:22.437
Did you reach out to any Circlers
during this crisis?


547
00:30:22.521 --> 00:30:26.733
- Annie? Anybody?
- Uh, no. I... No.


548
00:30:26.817 --> 00:30:30.862
Mae, there are four groups here
for staffers dealing with MS,


549
00:30:30.946 --> 00:30:33.031
two of them for children of MS patients.

550
00:30:33.115 --> 00:30:35.367
Have you sought out a group?

551
00:30:35.450 --> 00:30:37.995
- I didn't know.
- Okay.


552
00:30:38.078 --> 00:30:42.165
Can you... talk about what you did
the rest of the weekend?


553
00:30:42.249 --> 00:30:44.835
Nothing, really. I just... I kayaked.

554
00:30:44.918 --> 00:30:48.088
You kayaked? With who?

555
00:30:48.171 --> 00:30:50.757
Nobody. Just on my own.

556
00:30:50.841 --> 00:30:52.342
I kayak.

557
00:30:52.426 --> 00:30:53.653
We could have kayaked together.

558
00:30:53.677 --> 00:30:58.724
Nothing on your profile about kayaking,
no smiles, no ratings, no posts.


559
00:30:58.807 --> 00:31:03.228
I'm no psychologist, but this behavior
sometimes stems from low self-worth.


560
00:31:03.312 --> 00:31:07.816
This is what participation is all about,
bringing you, lifting you up.


561
00:31:07.899 --> 00:31:11.153
Thus, your participation window.

562
00:31:11.236 --> 00:31:14.740
I can't believe you've been here this long
without being on the main social feed.


563
00:31:14.823 --> 00:31:16.950
You're about to have your world rocked.

564
00:31:18.035 --> 00:31:19.995
See, these are all
of last week's messages.


565
00:31:20.078 --> 00:31:21.705
That's why there's so many.

566
00:31:21.788 --> 00:31:24.791
- [stammers] Eight thousand?
- Mm-hm.


567
00:31:24.875 --> 00:31:28.295
Looks like you have a lot
of catching up to do here. A feast!


568
00:31:28.378 --> 00:31:29.921
- [chuckles]
- Have fun.


569
00:31:31.423 --> 00:31:33.258
Oh, forgot one more thing.

570
00:31:33.342 --> 00:31:37.179
This is your participation rank.
Party rank for short.


571
00:31:37.262 --> 00:31:41.308
Some people here call it the
popularity rank, but it's not really that.


572
00:31:41.391 --> 00:31:43.310
It's just an algorithm-generated number

573
00:31:43.393 --> 00:31:46.313
that takes into account
all your activity in the inner circle.


574
00:31:46.396 --> 00:31:47.396
That makes sense?

575
00:31:48.315 --> 00:31:51.860
- I think so.
- Okay. And again, it's just for fun.


576
00:31:51.943 --> 00:31:53.904
- It's just for fun!
- Okay, bye.


577
00:31:53.987 --> 00:31:54.987
[laughs]

578
00:31:57.199 --> 00:31:59.618
[man] Um, I think
it's for Tuesday next week?


579
00:31:59.701 --> 00:32:01.370
[woman] Is that in Building 74 or...?

580
00:32:01.453 --> 00:32:03.693
- [man] Uh, no. It's actually off campus.
- [woman] Okay.


581
00:32:11.963 --> 00:32:13.965
[types]

582
00:32:44.037 --> 00:32:45.037
[Mom] <i>It's been a month.</i>

583
00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:47.833
<i>When are you coming home?
We miss you.</i>


584
00:32:47.916 --> 00:32:49.626
I can't. You know.

585
00:32:49.709 --> 00:32:52.587
<i>How's the dorm?
Do you have to clean your own room?</i>


586
00:32:52.671 --> 00:32:54.965
- We have people that do that.
- <i>Ooh, thank God.</i>


587
00:32:55.048 --> 00:32:57.134
How's Dad?

588
00:32:57.217 --> 00:33:00.178
<i>He's okay. He... he fell yesterday.</i>

589
00:33:00.262 --> 00:33:03.765
<i>And I couldn't lift him up,
but thank God Mercer came by.</i>


590
00:33:03.849 --> 00:33:05.058
<i>He's stronger than I thought.</i>

591
00:33:06.768 --> 00:33:07.769
I'm sorry.

592
00:33:08.854 --> 00:33:09.980
I should have been there.

593
00:33:18.447 --> 00:33:19.531
Is that one of his?

594
00:33:20.532 --> 00:33:24.369
<i>- Yeah. I think it's his best work.</i>
- It's awesome.


595
00:33:24.453 --> 00:33:25.454
[camera clicks]

596
00:33:26.705 --> 00:33:30.000
I gotta go, Mom. I love you.

597
00:33:30.083 --> 00:33:32.169
<i>- Okay, well, bye. Bye.</i>
- Bye.


598
00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:42.471
[types]

599
00:33:48.143 --> 00:33:51.771
I'm so sorry about last week.
I've been up my own ass.


600
00:33:51.855 --> 00:33:53.708
[chuckles] And I didn't mean
to be a shitty friend.


601
00:33:53.732 --> 00:33:56.193
It's okay. Where are we going?

602
00:33:56.276 --> 00:33:58.737
Listen, I've been looking
into your parents' situation,


603
00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:01.781
and I think... 
I have an idea.

604
00:34:01.865 --> 00:34:03.700
All right? Yeah?

605
00:34:03.783 --> 00:34:04.951
- Hi.
- [woman] Hi.


606
00:34:05.035 --> 00:34:08.830
- This is Jessica. This is Mae.
- Hello, Mae, how are you?


607
00:34:08.914 --> 00:34:11.458
I understand you haven't done
your medical intake yet.


608
00:34:11.541 --> 00:34:13.793
- No.
- Can you drink this for me?


609
00:34:18.965 --> 00:34:20.258
All of it, if you can.

610
00:34:25.096 --> 00:34:28.892
- I told you about Mae's dad's...
- [Jessica] Mm-hm, multiple sclerosis.


611
00:34:28.975 --> 00:34:32.020
I did my post doc on MS.
Love to get some real time data.


612
00:34:33.313 --> 00:34:34.356
Here you go.

613
00:34:35.398 --> 00:34:36.398
Okay.

614
00:34:38.068 --> 00:34:40.362
- How does this feel?
- Warm.


615
00:34:42.322 --> 00:34:44.741
- Is this for free?
- [laughs]


616
00:34:44.824 --> 00:34:46.660
Of course. You get to keep it.

617
00:34:46.743 --> 00:34:48.578
So, it's going to feel warm
for a few days,


618
00:34:48.662 --> 00:34:50.956
then you and the media band
will get used to each other,


619
00:34:51.039 --> 00:34:54.042
but it has to
touch the skin to work.

620
00:34:54.125 --> 00:34:56.795
Waterproof. No need to take it off.

621
00:34:56.878 --> 00:34:58.505
Let's activate it, shall we?

622
00:35:00.382 --> 00:35:01.216
Is that the...?

623
00:35:01.299 --> 00:35:04.719
Well, it's syncing up with the sensor
you ingested a second ago.


624
00:35:08.139 --> 00:35:09.891
- And now...
- [computer beeps]


625
00:35:09.975 --> 00:35:12.215
- Let's have you walk around the room.
- [system beeping]


626
00:35:16.481 --> 00:35:17.481
Briskly.

627
00:35:19.276 --> 00:35:22.612
It'll collect data on your heart rate,
blood pressure, cholesterol,


628
00:35:22.696 --> 00:35:28.410
sleep duration, sleep quality,
digestive efficiency, on and on.


629
00:35:28.493 --> 00:35:31.288
And all that data is stored
in the Cloud and in your tablet,


630
00:35:31.371 --> 00:35:34.874
anywhere you want, and of course, it's all
collated with the rest of the Circle.


631
00:35:36.042 --> 00:35:37.562
You'd be amazed at the patterns we see

632
00:35:37.586 --> 00:35:40.213
and the problems we can avoid
when we have all that data.


633
00:35:40.297 --> 00:35:42.692
Speaking of which, I was thinking
it would make sense for...


634
00:35:42.716 --> 00:35:45.427
[clears throat] Mae's folks to come
on the Circle health plan.


635
00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:47.137
Uh, wait, what?

636
00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:49.699
[Jessica] Wouldn't be the first time,
and I'd really like to get


637
00:35:49.723 --> 00:35:50.932
real time data from your dad.

638
00:35:51.016 --> 00:35:52.350
- [pats chair]
- Sit back down.


639
00:35:52.434 --> 00:35:54.144
Can you get in touch with HR,

640
00:35:54.227 --> 00:35:55.371
- clear it with them?
- [Annie] Yep.


641
00:35:55.395 --> 00:35:57.105
- Tell them I say it's a go.
- Absolutely.


642
00:35:58.940 --> 00:36:01.359
We'll send someone out
to set them up, okay?


643
00:36:03.486 --> 00:36:05.572
[Mom] <i>Honey, this is gonna</i>
<i>save our lives.</i>


644
00:36:05.655 --> 00:36:09.242
<i>- Thank you. And thank Annie too.</i>
- [chuckles] They thank you.


645
00:36:09.326 --> 00:36:10.827
- Aw.
- [laughs]


646
00:36:10.910 --> 00:36:13.330
<i>This is amazing. 
Call you later, okay?</i>

647
00:36:13.413 --> 00:36:16.249
Okay. I gotta go.
Big event here on campus.


648
00:36:16.333 --> 00:36:17.500
<i>- Exciting.</i>
- I know.


649
00:36:17.584 --> 00:36:19.377
<i>- I love you.</i>
- I love you, too.


650
00:36:19.461 --> 00:36:21.838
- Bye, Mom!
- [laughs] Bye.


651
00:36:23.298 --> 00:36:26.885
- [sobs] Thank you.
- Oh. You're welcome.


652
00:36:28.803 --> 00:36:30.972
All right. You okay?

653
00:36:31.056 --> 00:36:33.266
- [both laughing]
- Okay. Come on.

[crowd cheering, applauding]

655
00:36:40.482 --> 00:36:44.861
[Tom] Openness is something
we advocate here at the Circle.


656
00:36:45.904 --> 00:36:46.905
We live it.

657
00:36:46.988 --> 00:36:50.742
We demonstrate our commitment
to openness every day.


658
00:36:52.327 --> 00:36:55.497
Our government, not so much.

659
00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:59.376
We expect openness,
and we get obfuscation.


660
00:36:59.459 --> 00:37:01.252
We get doublespeak.

661
00:37:01.336 --> 00:37:06.800
No wonder Congress' approval rating
is currently at 11 percent.


662
00:37:06.883 --> 00:37:08.385
[crowd murmuring]

663
00:37:08.468 --> 00:37:11.596
Now, I'm sure a lot of you
have heard about a certain senator


664
00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:17.769
who it was revealed has been involved
in some... very unsavory business.


665
00:37:18.812 --> 00:37:23.191
What are we to learn from this?
We need accountability.


666
00:37:23.274 --> 00:37:25.360
We need openness.

667
00:37:25.443 --> 00:37:29.030
We need to know
what the people who represent us


668
00:37:29.114 --> 00:37:32.742
are doing with their time on our dime.

[crowd applauding]

670

To serve us better.

671
00:37:36.746 --> 00:37:38.331
Well, I'm happy to report

672
00:37:38.415 --> 00:37:43.628
that there's a woman
who is taking all of this very seriously


673
00:37:43.712 --> 00:37:48.717
and is taking some pretty dramatic steps
to address the problem.


674
00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:51.720
So please join me in welcoming

675
00:37:51.803 --> 00:37:55.473
Olivia Santos,
Congresswoman for District 14.

[crowd applauding]

677
00:37:59.936 --> 00:38:01.056
[Santos] That's right, Tom.

678
00:38:02.021 --> 00:38:06.025
I am as concerned as you are
about the need for citizens to know


679
00:38:06.109 --> 00:38:09.112
what their elected leaders are doing.

680
00:38:09.195 --> 00:38:15.243
So I intend to show exactly
how democracy can and should be.


681
00:38:20.206 --> 00:38:23.585
Starting today, my every meeting,

682

my every phone call
and e-mail will be accessible


683
00:38:28.465 --> 00:38:32.135
to my constituents and to the world.

684
00:38:35.472 --> 00:38:37.849
- In real time!
- [crowd cheering]


685
00:38:37.932 --> 00:38:43.563
It will all be on my True You page.
That's right. Thank you, thank you.


686
00:38:43.646 --> 00:38:46.900
[Tom] Goodbye, backroom deals.
Goodbye, shady lobbyists.


687
00:38:46.983 --> 00:38:51.488
Hello, democracy. 
Open and accountable!

688
00:38:51.571 --> 00:38:53.156
[Santos] That's right. 
That's a fact!

689
00:38:54.866 --> 00:38:58.203
- [woman] Where do you work?
- [Mae] I work in customer experience.


690
00:38:58.286 --> 00:39:01.498
I started in CE, too. 
A lot of us did.

691
00:39:01.581 --> 00:39:03.500
Cool. Where do you work now?

692
00:39:03.583 --> 00:39:06.419
Biometrics, iris scanning,
facial recognition.


693
00:39:06.503 --> 00:39:09.172
Right now, I'm working on Child Track.

694
00:39:09.255 --> 00:39:12.175
The program protects children
from predators.


695
00:39:12.258 --> 00:39:15.136
The second a kid isn't where
they're supposed to be, an alert goes off


696
00:39:15.220 --> 00:39:17.722
and the kid can be tracked down
within 90 seconds.


697
00:39:17.806 --> 00:39:22.018
- Wow. Do they wear a bracelet or...?
- We place chips in the bone.

You're serious?

701
00:39:31.361 --> 00:39:35.532
I'm serious about immediately reducing
kidnapping, rape, and murder


702
00:39:35.615 --> 00:39:37.116
by 99 percent.

703

I think I'm going to get a drink.

- Oh.

about the whole presentation?

Well, it was supposed to be a part
of a subway but they abandoned it.

- Where does it go?
- It connects to the bay.

into it, gets too wet.

- The rest of what?
- The rest of it all.

Santos is just the start.

748
00:43:09.162 --> 00:43:12.415
The plan is everything recorded,
seen, broadcast,


749

all of it stored, analyzed,
available to the Circle in any way.

You did your health intake, right?

- Yeah.
- See, right? Look.

Every step, every breath,
all of it stored.

We're being studied.

Everyone's data in the Circle
is being studied, monetized.


756
00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:35.980
It is voluntary.

757
00:43:37.148 --> 00:43:40.443
And isn't that the whole point?
Having everything in one place?

00:43:42.111 --> 00:43:44.197
I mean, that's True You.

That's not why I invented True You.
Not even close.

No, you're not.

764
00:43:57.293 --> 00:43:59.962
Ty Lafitte has been off the grid
for years.


765
00:44:02.590 --> 00:44:05.593
- Oh, my God.
- [Ty sighs]


766
00:44:05.676 --> 00:44:06.676
I'm Ty.

767
00:44:07.512 --> 00:44:09.430
Why the low profile?

768
00:44:09.514 --> 00:44:12.308
I just wanted to move through
this world like a normal person.


769
00:44:12.391 --> 00:44:14.894
I didn't wanna be watched every second.

770
00:44:14.977 --> 00:44:17.146
But I do spend
a lot of time here.

771
00:44:17.230 --> 00:44:20.358
It's easier. I don't have to deal
with Stenton and Bailey.


772
00:44:20.441 --> 00:44:24.695
Not that I'm privy to their conversations
in their little sanctum.


773
00:44:24.779 --> 00:44:29.158
Holy shit. I'm in
a cave with Ty Lafitte.

774
00:44:29.242 --> 00:44:35.373
Wait, hold on. So when we met,
you didn't know who I was?


775
00:44:35.456 --> 00:44:38.209
You never told me your name.

776
00:44:38.292 --> 00:44:40.336
And after a while,
it was just weird to ask.


777
00:44:40.419 --> 00:44:42.046
[chuckles]

778
00:44:42.130 --> 00:44:46.467
I knew I could trust you when I met you.
I don't know, I just thought to myself,


779
00:44:46.551 --> 00:44:48.751
this girl, she doesn't have
a cynical bone in her body.


780
00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:51.430
Reminds me of how I used to be.

781
00:44:52.431 --> 00:44:55.101
Listen, you can't tell anyone
that you were here.


782
00:44:55.184 --> 00:44:56.424
Okay? That I brought you here.

783
00:44:57.436 --> 00:44:58.437
Okay.

784
00:44:58.521 --> 00:45:02.859
Things at the Circle,
they need to change.


785
00:45:02.942 --> 00:45:05.152
Like what? Connecting the world?

786
00:45:06.445 --> 00:45:08.281
Insuring my parents?

787
00:45:08.364 --> 00:45:10.950
You should be really proud
of what you created.


788
00:45:11.033 --> 00:45:13.035
Look, proud? Proud of what?

789
00:45:13.119 --> 00:45:16.330
The disregard for privacy,
the use of personal data


790
00:45:16.414 --> 00:45:18.875
for the accumulation of wealth
and control?


791
00:45:18.958 --> 00:45:20.877
I'm not proud.
This is not what I created.


792
00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:22.938
Do you think Senator Williamson
being investigated


793
00:45:22.962 --> 00:45:25.047
by the FBI is just a coincidence?

794
00:45:25.131 --> 00:45:27.025
We can't be seen together,
and you have to promise me.


795
00:45:27.049 --> 00:45:28.849
You can't tell anyone
that we were down here.


796

[cell phone buzzes]

[woman]<i>Mae, you have a visitor here</i>
<i>to see you.</i>

[indistinct chattering]

801
00:45:53.784 --> 00:45:55.536
- Hey.
- Hey.


802
00:45:55.620 --> 00:45:58.664
- Are you okay?
- No, I'm really not okay.


803
00:45:59.749 --> 00:46:01.918
Why didn't you call, send a text?

804
00:46:02.001 --> 00:46:05.463
Because I wanted to see you in person.
I wanted to look you in the eyes.


805
00:46:07.006 --> 00:46:08.090
Okay.

806
00:46:08.174 --> 00:46:13.930
- Um, I'll sign you in.
- No, just wait, I...


807
00:46:14.013 --> 00:46:17.683
- The stuff you posted about my work.
- Your chandeliers?


808
00:46:17.767 --> 00:46:20.937
Yeah. [stammers]
I know you meant well, but...


809
00:46:21.020 --> 00:46:23.439
What's the problem?
I thought I saw good stuff going up.


810
00:46:23.522 --> 00:46:25.441
They started calling me a deer killer.

811
00:46:26.442 --> 00:46:29.195
And then there's a campaign
to shut me down.


812
00:46:29.278 --> 00:46:31.697
I wasn't even online. 
I was working.

813
00:46:31.781 --> 00:46:34.575
And when I checked my e-mail,
there were death threats.


814
00:46:38.663 --> 00:46:39.705
I'm sorry.

815
00:46:39.789 --> 00:46:41.123
Death threats, Mae.

816
00:46:41.207 --> 00:46:43.042
Obviously, I never meant
for this to happen.


817
00:46:43.125 --> 00:46:45.419
But I... I can fix it.

818
00:46:45.503 --> 00:46:46.504
[Mercer scoffs]

Mae.

821
00:46:53.928 --> 00:46:55.012
Will you listen to me?

822
00:46:56.305 --> 00:46:57.181
I can't do this.

823
00:46:57.264 --> 00:47:00.726
I can't be a part of this world
that you're creating.


824
00:47:00.810 --> 00:47:01.936
What are you talking about?

825
00:47:02.019 --> 00:47:04.105
Jesus Christ, look at these people!

826
00:47:04.188 --> 00:47:05.815
Does this really seem okay to you?

827
00:47:05.898 --> 00:47:07.626
Why don't you go
kill some more deer, Mercer?


828
00:47:07.650 --> 00:47:10.653
I never killed any deer.
I don't kill deer.


829
00:47:10.736 --> 00:47:14.198
Mercer, look, let's not do this here.

830
00:47:14.281 --> 00:47:15.825
Let's go upstairs.

831
00:47:15.908 --> 00:47:18.285
- I'll figure it out.
- Do you ever leave this place, Mae?


832
00:47:19.870 --> 00:47:23.624
We used to go on adventures
and have fun and see things,


833
00:47:23.708 --> 00:47:26.168
and you were brave and excited.

834
00:47:28.004 --> 00:47:30.297
And now it's all filtered through this.

835

I'm so lucky that you guys
were around here.

SeeChange cameras saved your life.

A cop saw you go through the fence,

850
00:50:55.461 --> 00:50:57.838
and then we got a call
from someone watching the seals.


851
00:51:04.303 --> 00:51:05.888
[Eamon] So, Mae, how do you feel?

I want to say how much
I value my position here...


863
00:51:40.631 --> 00:51:42.299
and what you've done for my family.

864
00:51:42.383 --> 00:51:45.970
Mae, you're a valued part of the Circle,
and you're family.

And we care about
everybody you care about.


866
00:51:49.682 --> 00:51:53.269
You know, this incident
has actually shown a lot of people


867
00:51:53.352 --> 00:51:54.561
the necessity for SeeChange.

868

I'm so glad those cameras were there.

I wish you would've known
there was a camera there

but... [chuckles]

about an idea, but before we do,


872
00:52:10.286 --> 00:52:11.996
is there anything you want to tell us?

That I've been here before?

874

It's only our lies that get us in trouble,
the things we hide.

Of course I know you've
been in here before.

that we cannot solve.

We can cure any disease
and we can end hunger, and...

Without secrets, without the hoarding
of knowledge and information,

00:53:08.135 --> 00:53:13.349
I thought I'd change it up a bit today
and not have a speech but an interview.


889
00:53:14.475 --> 00:53:16.852
I had a conversation
with a young Circler the other day


890
00:53:16.935 --> 00:53:18.437
that I wanted to share with you.

891
00:53:19.438 --> 00:53:22.775
I've asked Mae Holland,
who some of you might know


892
00:53:22.858 --> 00:53:26.362
as one of our new guppies in customer
experience, to join me today.


893
00:53:26.445 --> 00:53:30.616
Mae's only been with us for a few months
but she has made quite an impression.


894
00:53:30.699 --> 00:53:33.035
Let's bring her out. Mae Holland!

Mae, how are you?

897
00:53:45.464 --> 00:53:46.465
- Terrified.
- Mm.

- Easy for you to say.
- [laughter]


900
00:53:51.345 --> 00:53:52.971
All right, Mae, we have all seen

901
00:53:53.055 --> 00:53:54.775
the SeeChange footage
from the other night,


902
00:53:54.848 --> 00:53:57.059
but please describe
what happened for us.


903
00:53:58.727 --> 00:54:00.062
I committed a crime.

904
00:54:01.313 --> 00:54:04.817
I borrowed a kayak
without the owner's knowledge,


905
00:54:04.900 --> 00:54:06.420
paddled out to the middle of the bay,

906
00:54:07.778 --> 00:54:10.447
and I wasn't wearing a life jacket.

907
00:54:10.531 --> 00:54:14.868
Well, I'm not sure
that's exactly a capital offense,


908
00:54:14.952 --> 00:54:17.079
but you did risk your own life.

909
00:54:18.330 --> 00:54:20.666
So, Mae, do you think
you behave better or worse


910
00:54:20.749 --> 00:54:23.585
- when you are being watched?
- Better.


911
00:54:25.170 --> 00:54:26.713
Without a doubt.

912
00:54:26.797 --> 00:54:29.550
And what happens when you're alone
and unobserved?


913
00:54:30.634 --> 00:54:32.511
Well, for starters, 
I steal kayaks.

914
00:54:32.594 --> 00:54:34.012

Jesus. She's a natural.

916
00:54:36.432 --> 00:54:40.561
Seriously. I do things I don't wanna do.

917
00:54:41.854 --> 00:54:43.188
I lie.

918
00:54:43.272 --> 00:54:45.208
When we spoke the other day,
you had a way of putting it


919
00:54:45.232 --> 00:54:46.876
that I thought
was very interesting and succinct.


920
00:54:46.900 --> 00:54:48.610
Could you tell us all what you said?

921
00:54:50.487 --> 00:54:52.614
I said that secrets are lies.

922
00:54:53.824 --> 00:54:55.200
Secrets are lies.

923
00:54:57.161 --> 00:54:58.161
Go on.

924
00:54:59.329 --> 00:55:04.585
Secrets are what make crimes possible.

925
00:55:04.668 --> 00:55:07.463
We behave worse
when we're not accountable.


926
00:55:08.881 --> 00:55:11.258
I was my worst self

927
00:55:11.341 --> 00:55:13.927
because I didn't think
anyone was watching.


928
00:55:15.554 --> 00:55:16.554
I thought...

929
00:55:18.140 --> 00:55:19.141
that I was alone.

930
00:55:20.267 --> 00:55:24.021
So, what did you see
on this kayaking trip, Mae?


931
00:55:24.104 --> 00:55:26.315
- Was it beautiful?
- [Mae] It was.


932
00:55:27.483 --> 00:55:29.193
There was almost a full moon.

933
00:55:30.319 --> 00:55:31.570
And it felt like...

934
00:55:33.614 --> 00:55:37.034
it felt like I was paddling
through liquid silver.


935
00:55:37.117 --> 00:55:39.620
Hmm, sounds incredible.

936
00:55:40.704 --> 00:55:42.789
But there's no record of any of it.

937
00:55:42.873 --> 00:55:44.875
- Not outside my own memory.
- Hmm.


938
00:55:44.958 --> 00:55:46.710
[crowd murmuring]

939
00:55:47.961 --> 00:55:49.338
Okay.

940
00:55:49.421 --> 00:55:51.882
So now here we get
into something personal.


941
00:55:51.965 --> 00:55:56.094
As you know, I have a son, Gunner,

942
00:55:57.179 --> 00:55:59.556
who was born with cerebral palsy.

943
00:55:59.640 --> 00:56:01.725
And though he's living a very full life

944
00:56:01.808 --> 00:56:04.770
and we're always trying
to improve his opportunities,


945
00:56:04.853 --> 00:56:07.898
he is confined to a wheelchair.

946
00:56:07.981 --> 00:56:10.984
He can't walk.

947
00:56:11.068 --> 00:56:12.986
He can't run.

948
00:56:13.070 --> 00:56:15.239
He can't go kayaking.

949
00:56:16.448 --> 00:56:19.993
So, what does he do if he wants
to experience something like that?


950
00:56:20.077 --> 00:56:22.079
Well, he watches video.

951
00:56:22.162 --> 00:56:23.622
He looks at pictures.

952
00:56:24.831 --> 00:56:28.961
And much of his experiences of the world
come through the experience of others.


953
00:56:29.044 --> 00:56:32.673
When he experiences the view
of a Circler climbing Mount Kenya,


954
00:56:32.756 --> 00:56:34.883
he feels like he's climbed Mount Kenya.

955
00:56:37.094 --> 00:56:40.556
When he sees firsthand video
from an America's Cup crew member,


956
00:56:40.639 --> 00:56:45.727
he feels in some way that he's sailed
in the America's Cup too.


957
00:56:45.811 --> 00:56:49.189
And these experiences
were facilitated by generous humans


958
00:56:49.273 --> 00:56:52.359
who shared what they saw with the world,
my son included,


959
00:56:52.442 --> 00:56:54.921
and there are many others out there
that are just like Gunner.


960
00:56:54.945 --> 00:56:57.573
Now does it feel right
to have deprived them


961
00:56:57.656 --> 00:56:59.366
of seeing what you saw, Mae?

962
00:57:03.036 --> 00:57:04.037
It doesn't.

963
00:57:07.207 --> 00:57:08.375
It feels very wrong.

964
00:57:11.336 --> 00:57:12.462
It was selfish.

965
00:57:14.339 --> 00:57:19.678
When you deprive others of experiences
like the ones I had,


966
00:57:22.556 --> 00:57:24.558
you're essentially stealing from them.

967
00:57:25.601 --> 00:57:30.022
Knowledge is a basic human right.

968
00:57:32.482 --> 00:57:38.864
Access to all possible human experience
is a basic human right.


969
00:57:38.947 --> 00:57:41.491
[audience cheering, applauding]

970
00:57:52.252 --> 00:57:55.797
Thank you, Mae, for your candor
and your consummate humanity.


971
00:57:55.881 --> 00:57:57.966
Now... now the best part.

972
00:57:58.050 --> 00:58:00.677
In the interest of sharing
everything she can with the world,


973
00:58:00.761 --> 00:58:03.472
Mae has, uh... 
Mae has some news.

974
00:58:07.100 --> 00:58:08.268
From now on...

975
00:58:10.187 --> 00:58:16.902
I'll be wearing a modified
SeeChange camera at all times.


976
00:58:19.404 --> 00:58:21.615
I'm going fully transparent.

977
00:58:21.698 --> 00:58:24.534
[audience cheering, applauding]

978
00:58:24.618 --> 00:58:26.662
Well, maybe not in the bathroom.

979
00:58:26.745 --> 00:58:28.622
[laughter]

980
00:58:28.705 --> 00:58:32.209
I'll be starting immediately.

981
00:58:32.292 --> 00:58:33.292
[Eamon] That's right.

982
00:58:35.087 --> 00:58:38.674
Mae will be the first Circler
to share every single second


983
00:58:38.757 --> 00:58:41.885
of her work
and her personal life with the public,


984
00:58:41.969 --> 00:58:44.262
so let's give her an even bigger hand!

985
00:58:44.346 --> 00:58:47.265
[applause continues]

986
00:58:54.314 --> 00:58:55.565
I'm proud of you.

987
00:59:01.196 --> 00:59:03.991
[all chant] Mae! Mae! Mae! Mae!

988
00:59:04.074 --> 00:59:05.367
Mae! Mae! Mae! Mae!

989
00:59:10.539 --> 00:59:11.540
[alarm clock ringing]

990
00:59:24.011 --> 00:59:25.363
- [camera clicks]
- [operator] <i>Hello.</i>


991
00:59:25.387 --> 00:59:27.347
Good morning, everyone.

992
00:59:27.431 --> 00:59:30.642
<i>The sun is shining,
and I definitely need my coffee.</i>


993
00:59:31.852 --> 00:59:34.813
We are in my third week of transparency,

994
00:59:34.896 --> 00:59:36.982
and we're up to...

995
00:59:37.065 --> 00:59:41.153
2,308,007 viewers.

996
00:59:41.236 --> 00:59:42.070
<i>Wow.</i>

997
00:59:42.154 --> 00:59:44.322
Did I tell you guys
I'm not a morning person?


998
00:59:45.490 --> 00:59:49.202
Okay, among all of those viewers...

999
00:59:50.328 --> 00:59:51.328
are...

1000
00:59:52.164 --> 00:59:54.541
- [Mom] <i>I don't even know what...</i>
- Hi, Mom, hi, Dad.


1001
00:59:54.624 --> 00:59:56.460
<i>- Hi!
- Hi, Mae.</i>


1002
00:59:56.543 --> 00:59:58.045
Say hello to everyone.

1003
00:59:58.128 --> 01:00:00.172
- [both] <i>Hello, Circle.</i>
<i>-</i>[Mae laughs]


1004
01:00:00.255 --> 01:00:02.758
Look. We match.

1005
01:00:02.841 --> 01:00:04.426
<i>- Yeah.
- We sure do.</i>


1006
01:00:04.509 --> 01:00:06.970
<i>- These are great.
- Very stylish.</i>


1007
01:00:07.054 --> 01:00:09.222
I love you guys. 
I'll see you later.

1008
01:00:09.306 --> 01:00:11.600
<i>- Love you. Bye.
- Love you too, sweetheart.</i>


1009
01:00:17.022 --> 01:00:20.817
- Hello, Circlers.
- [all] <i>Hi, Mae.</i>


1010
01:00:20.901 --> 01:00:23.904
So this is where I worked
when I first arrived at the Circle,


1011
01:00:23.987 --> 01:00:27.365
and this is where I still work
at the Circle. [chuckles]


1012
01:00:27.449 --> 01:00:30.160
Because even though I have you guys
looking over my shoulder...


1013
01:00:30.243 --> 01:00:33.538
[sighs] I'm still basically a guppy.

1014
01:00:33.622 --> 01:00:38.376
- [laughs] Go! Do it!
- Do it! Do it! Do it!


1015
01:00:38.460 --> 01:00:41.338
- [growls]
<i>- Oh, my God!</i>[laughs]


1016
01:00:41.421 --> 01:00:43.608
[man] <i>What are you doing?</i>
<i>Tell your own stories, sheep.</i>


1017
01:00:43.632 --> 01:00:46.009
<i>Stop looking at us, sheep!</i>

1018
01:00:46.093 --> 01:00:47.719
<i>All right, that's our scene.</i>

1019
01:00:47.803 --> 01:00:50.555
- [crowd applauding, cheering]
- Whoo!


1020
01:00:50.639 --> 01:00:55.060
Sorry about that. Okay, so, next up,
we just need the name of a person


1021
01:00:55.143 --> 01:00:58.980
who is historically significant.

1022
01:00:59.064 --> 01:01:02.150
- Mae Holland! [laughs]
- Oh, my God!


1023
01:01:02.234 --> 01:01:03.735
<i>Sorry, we don't know who that is.</i>

1024
01:01:03.819 --> 01:01:07.197
- She's nobody, trust me.
- [laughter]


1025
01:01:09.449 --> 01:01:11.118
Home sweet home.

1026
01:01:11.201 --> 01:01:13.453
Speaking of which,
let's check in with the folks.


1027
01:01:15.789 --> 01:01:18.041
Hey, where are you guys?

1028
01:01:22.921 --> 01:01:23.922
- [moans]
<i>- Yeah.</i>


1029
01:01:24.005 --> 01:01:26.925
<i>- Yeah. There you go.</i>
- Whoa! Ah!


1030
01:01:27.008 --> 01:01:28.385
Um... [breathing heavily]

1031
01:01:28.468 --> 01:01:30.679
Uh, I hope the engineers are watching,

1032
01:01:30.762 --> 01:01:33.074
because that definitely
shouldn't have happened [chuckles]


1033
01:01:33.098 --> 01:01:36.434
and, um, it definitely
won't happen again. [laughs]


1034
01:01:36.518 --> 01:01:38.204
- You can trust me there.
- [Mae's dad moaning]


1035
01:01:38.228 --> 01:01:39.896
[laughs]

1036
01:01:48.738 --> 01:01:51.116
<i>This is me brushing my teeth.</i>

1037
01:01:51.199 --> 01:01:53.285
<i>If you're enjoying this,
I'm worried about you.</i>


1038
01:01:55.328 --> 01:01:56.371
[watch beeps]

1039
01:02:05.755 --> 01:02:06.756
[exhales]

1040
01:02:09.759 --> 01:02:11.219
Good night, everyone.

1041
01:02:12.429 --> 01:02:14.973
I'm not gonna lie,
it was a crazy day,

1042
01:02:15.056 --> 01:02:18.143
but I'm happy I had you with me,
each and every one of you.


1043
01:03:08.193 --> 01:03:09.694
[Mae] <i>Never a boring day here.</i>

1044
01:03:10.862 --> 01:03:13.990
A lot of you guys have been asking me
about this sculpture,


1045
01:03:14.074 --> 01:03:15.367
which is a treat for me.

1046
01:03:15.450 --> 01:03:18.161
I finally get to use
my art history degree.


1047
01:03:18.245 --> 01:03:21.122
<i>This was made by an artist
who has frequently been in trouble</i>


1048
01:03:21.206 --> 01:03:22.707
<i>in his own country.</i>

1049
01:03:22.791 --> 01:03:26.795
I wanna thank all the watchers
who sent frowns to the government there,


1050
01:03:26.878 --> 01:03:29.839
both for their persecution of the artist

1051
01:03:29.923 --> 01:03:32.592
and for their restriction
on Internet freedoms.


1052
01:03:32.676 --> 01:03:37.055
We have sent 180 million frowns
from the U.S. alone.


1053
01:03:37.138 --> 01:03:40.267
You can bet that's gonna have
an effect on the regime.


1054
01:03:42.852 --> 01:03:44.062
Annie.

1055
01:03:44.145 --> 01:03:46.773
[indistinct chattering]

1056
01:03:46.856 --> 01:03:47.857
[Mae] <i>Annie.</i>

1057
01:03:49.359 --> 01:03:50.360
Annie!

1058
01:03:53.780 --> 01:03:54.780
Annie!

1059
01:04:02.122 --> 01:04:03.164
Annie!

1060
01:04:05.208 --> 01:04:07.877
Annie Allerton! [pants]

1061
01:04:18.805 --> 01:04:19.805
Are we alone?

1062
01:04:21.391 --> 01:04:24.686
I have three minutes to use the bathroom
without the video on.


1063
01:04:24.769 --> 01:04:26.187
[scoffs] Pervs.

1064
01:04:28.315 --> 01:04:29.482
How are you? [chuckles]

1065
01:04:31.776 --> 01:04:33.486
- Good.
- Well...


1066
01:04:33.570 --> 01:04:34.571
you should be good.

1067
01:04:34.654 --> 01:04:35.655
You're killing it.

1068
01:04:36.906 --> 01:04:37.741
Do you think?

1069
01:04:37.824 --> 01:04:39.784
Oh, come on,
false modesty won't work here.


1070
01:04:39.868 --> 01:04:40.868
You should be psyched.

1071
01:04:42.078 --> 01:04:43.078
Yeah.

1072
01:04:44.164 --> 01:04:46.207
- I am.
- You're a meteor. It's insane.


1073
01:04:46.291 --> 01:04:48.311
People are coming to me
trying to get to you. [chuckles]


1074
01:04:48.335 --> 01:04:49.502
It's... crazy.

1075
01:04:51.338 --> 01:04:52.547
How are you really, Annie?

1076
01:04:53.923 --> 01:04:55.008
You look wiped.

1077
01:04:55.091 --> 01:04:58.094
Thanks, Mae.
You know how much I like to be told


1078
01:04:58.178 --> 01:04:59.989
right after I appear
in front of your millions


1079
01:05:00.013 --> 01:05:02.640
that I look terrible.
Thank you, you're sweet.


1080
01:05:02.724 --> 01:05:04.017
Let me take you for dinner.

1081
01:05:06.394 --> 01:05:07.937
[sighs] You gotta eat sometime.

1082
01:05:08.021 --> 01:05:11.483
Your camera and me looking so terrible.
That sounds fantastic, but, no.


1083
01:05:11.566 --> 01:05:14.152
I just... [stutters]
I'm worried about you.


1084
01:05:14.235 --> 01:05:17.322
- You're working too hard.
- You're worried about me?


1085
01:05:17.405 --> 01:05:19.157
You're... I'm worried about the EU,

1086
01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:20.676
but it's good to know
you're worried about me.


1087
01:05:20.700 --> 01:05:23.161
- I didn't mean it that way.
- Don't worry in any way.


1088
01:05:26.539 --> 01:05:29.459
- I know you can handle it.
- Oh, thank you, Mae.


1089
01:05:29.542 --> 01:05:32.128
Your confidence in me
will be the wind beneath my wings.


1090
01:05:34.089 --> 01:05:35.089
How are your parents?

1091
01:05:38.676 --> 01:05:39.677
Sorry.

1092
01:05:41.012 --> 01:05:42.055
[exhales]

1093
01:05:42.138 --> 01:05:44.933
They're over that little... episode?

1094
01:05:49.145 --> 01:05:51.815
I haven't heard from them, actually.
[sniffs]


1095
01:05:53.733 --> 01:05:55.860
I guess it'll just take some time.

1096
01:05:55.944 --> 01:05:58.071
Sorry, Mae. Shit.

1097
01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:01.241
I'm fried.

1098
01:06:03.410 --> 01:06:05.120
And I have to pull another all-nighter.

1099
01:06:06.704 --> 01:06:08.915
Stenton is on my ass all the time.

1100
01:06:08.998 --> 01:06:12.460
I shouldn't have questioned him
about that whole Senator Williamson thing.


1101
01:06:13.545 --> 01:06:17.173
And then...
there's all the new work on Completion.


1102
01:06:18.258 --> 01:06:20.093
But I assume Bailey told you about that.

1103
01:06:23.138 --> 01:06:24.848
Of course.

1104
01:06:24.931 --> 01:06:26.224
[Annie] Of course.

1105
01:06:26.307 --> 01:06:28.467
I'll be there
at the Concept Kingdom meeting tomorrow.


1106
01:06:28.518 --> 01:06:29.518
What?

1107
01:06:31.521 --> 01:06:34.357
- There's a Concept Kingdom...
- I know what it is. But you're going?


1108
01:06:34.441 --> 01:06:39.237
- Yeah. Bailey said I should be there.
- And broadcast it?


1109
01:06:41.114 --> 01:06:42.657
- Is that a problem?
- No.


1110
01:06:42.740 --> 01:06:45.452
I'm just surprised, that's all.
Those meetings are sensitive.


1111
01:06:45.535 --> 01:06:48.621
You know, maybe he's planning on
having you attend just the beginning.


1112
01:06:48.705 --> 01:06:50.957
[chuckles] I mean, Mae,
you're in over your head.


1113
01:06:53.543 --> 01:06:55.086
[Mae] Are you leaving?

1114
01:06:55.170 --> 01:06:56.504
Yeah. [clears throat]

1115
01:06:57.589 --> 01:07:00.175
I'm really so far behind on everything,
I could just die.


1116
01:07:04.137 --> 01:07:05.138
Annie?

1117
01:07:06.806 --> 01:07:08.246
- [camera chimes]
- [operator] <i>Hello.</i>


1118
01:07:10.143 --> 01:07:11.143
See ya.

1119
01:07:21.404 --> 01:07:25.825
[Eamon] <i>So here's how many people voted</i>
<i>in the last national election.</i>


1120
01:07:25.909 --> 01:07:28.870
<i>Here's how many were eligible to vote.</i>

1121
01:07:30.997 --> 01:07:35.210
And here is how many Americans
are registered in the Circle.


1122
01:07:36.794 --> 01:07:38.630
- [laughter]
- And there's that guy.


1123
01:07:38.713 --> 01:07:40.840
So now we get down to the meat
of today's session,


1124
01:07:40.924 --> 01:07:44.052
something we've discussed
with Congresswoman Santos and others.


1125
01:07:45.428 --> 01:07:51.851
What if... your Circle profile
automatically registered you to vote?


1126
01:07:53.686 --> 01:07:56.022
With True You,
in order to set up a profile,


1127
01:07:56.105 --> 01:07:58.775
you have to be a real person
with a real address,


1128
01:07:58.858 --> 01:08:02.487
the complete personal info,
real social security number,


1129
01:08:02.570 --> 01:08:04.697
with all the information
that the government wants


1130
01:08:04.781 --> 01:08:06.741
when you register to vote.

1131
01:08:06.824 --> 01:08:10.870
So why wouldn't the state
consider you already registered


1132
01:08:10.954 --> 01:08:12.580
when you open a Circle account?

1133
01:08:13.665 --> 01:08:15.250
There's no reason.

1134
01:08:15.333 --> 01:08:20.296
Uh, we've got verbal commitments
from governors of almost every state,


1135
01:08:20.380 --> 01:08:25.385
and they've agreed to push for legislation
that would make your Circle account


1136
01:08:25.468 --> 01:08:28.012
an automatic path to voter registration.

1137
01:08:30.265 --> 01:08:31.265
[man] Bravo.

1138
01:08:34.852 --> 01:08:36.312
I think it's a great idea.

1139
01:08:41.651 --> 01:08:44.112
Well, yes, Mae.

1140
01:08:47.782 --> 01:08:50.034
Why couldn't we take it one step further?

1141
01:08:51.035 --> 01:08:52.412
I mean, I...

1142
01:08:52.495 --> 01:08:56.082
I don't have it
completely figured out yet...


1143
01:08:56.165 --> 01:08:59.294
No, no, no, go on, go on, go on.
You started really well there.


1144
01:08:59.377 --> 01:09:02.338
I like those words, "one step further."
It's how the company was built.


1145
01:09:04.507 --> 01:09:08.469
Okay. Working backwards from your goal...

1146
01:09:08.553 --> 01:09:10.138
Go on.

1147
01:09:10.221 --> 01:09:13.099
We all agree 100 percent participation
is what we'd like.


1148
01:09:13.182 --> 01:09:15.685
A hundred percent participation
is the ideal.


1149
01:09:15.768 --> 01:09:18.938
That's the idealist's ideal, yes.

1150
01:09:19.022 --> 01:09:23.401
And we already have 83 percent
of voting-age Americans


1151
01:09:23.484 --> 01:09:24.902
registered to the Circle.

1152
01:09:24.986 --> 01:09:26.195
Yep.

1153
01:09:26.279 --> 01:09:28.114
And it seems we're on our way

1154
01:09:28.197 --> 01:09:32.410
to users being able to register it
and maybe actually vote


1155
01:09:32.493 --> 01:09:33.554
through their Circle account.

1156
01:09:33.578 --> 01:09:38.124
Well, that's a small leap, but... Yes.
Okay, go on.


1157
01:09:40.251 --> 01:09:45.381
Why not require every voting-age citizen
to have a Circle account?


1158
01:09:45.465 --> 01:09:48.301
- [all murmuring]
- Let her finish. Let her finish.


1159
01:09:48.384 --> 01:09:51.763
Okay, I know the initial reaction
will be resistance.


1160
01:09:51.846 --> 01:09:55.266
I mean, how can we require anyone
to use our services?


1161
01:09:56.351 --> 01:09:58.287
But there are all kinds of things
that are mandatory


1162
01:09:58.311 --> 01:09:59.455
for citizens of this country.

1163
01:09:59.479 --> 01:10:01.439
Yep. We have to pay taxes
we don't wanna pay.


1164
01:10:01.522 --> 01:10:03.149
And we have to pay for Social Security.

1165
01:10:03.232 --> 01:10:05.902
- We have to serve on juries.
- Right.


1166
01:10:05.985 --> 01:10:08.404
And we have to pee indoors,
not on the street. [chuckles]


1167
01:10:08.488 --> 01:10:10.782
- We do. We do have to be pee indoors.
- She's right.


1168
01:10:10.865 --> 01:10:13.076
I mean, we have thousands of laws.

1169
01:10:13.159 --> 01:10:16.329
We require citizens
to do hundreds of things,


1170
01:10:16.412 --> 01:10:19.123
but we don't require them to vote?

1171
01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:24.420
They are already doing this
in dozens of countries.


1172
01:10:24.504 --> 01:10:28.925
With the technology we already have,
users will already be registered.


1173
01:10:29.008 --> 01:10:34.138
That means you have 241 million voters
eligible to vote.


1174
01:10:34.222 --> 01:10:38.768
You have 241 million voters
that have to vote.


1175
01:10:41.312 --> 01:10:43.231
You have the full will of the nation.

1176
01:10:43.314 --> 01:10:45.983
- And how exactly do we do that?
- Annie.


1177
01:10:47.235 --> 01:10:51.739
Well, you know,
it could be something as simple as a zing,


1178
01:10:51.823 --> 01:10:56.160
"Hey, Annie.
Remember to take five minutes and vote."


1179
01:10:56.244 --> 01:11:00.456
It's what we would do
with our own surveys. You know that.


1180
01:11:00.540 --> 01:11:04.877
- But, Mae, what about stragglers?
- We all pay taxes.


1181
01:11:06.504 --> 01:11:08.881
And what, 80 percent of us
did that online last year.


1182
01:11:11.259 --> 01:11:14.053
Why not stop duplicating services?

1183
01:11:15.221 --> 01:11:18.516
Why not just make it all part
of one unified system?


1184
01:11:18.599 --> 01:11:23.479
You could pay your taxes,
vote, pay your parking ticket,


1185
01:11:23.563 --> 01:11:25.773
all through your Circle account.

1186
01:11:25.857 --> 01:11:28.568
We'd save users hundreds of hours
of inconvenience.


1187
01:11:28.651 --> 01:11:31.904
- We'd save the government billions.
- Hundreds of billions.


1188
01:11:31.988 --> 01:11:34.198
We could eliminate half of it overnight.

1189
01:11:34.282 --> 01:11:36.563
Why wouldn't the government
just build a similar service?


1190
01:11:36.617 --> 01:11:37.910
Why the hell does it need us?

1191
01:11:40.955 --> 01:11:43.958
It would cost too much.
They don't have the expertise.


1192
01:11:44.041 --> 01:11:47.420
- We already have the infrastructure.
- [Eamon] You're absolutely right.


1193
01:11:47.503 --> 01:11:51.841
The government needs us
more than we need them.


1194
01:11:51.924 --> 01:11:56.220
Imagine having the full will
of the people.


1195
01:11:57.805 --> 01:11:58.848
Instantly.

1196
01:12:01.100 --> 01:12:04.479
You'd have... true democracy

1197
01:12:05.563 --> 01:12:07.815
for the first time in human history.

1198
01:12:09.192 --> 01:12:11.032
- [Annie] This is such bullshit.
- [door opens]


1199
01:12:13.321 --> 01:12:14.322
[door closes]

1200
01:12:16.115 --> 01:12:18.618
No voter suppression.
You're voting from home.


1201
01:12:18.701 --> 01:12:21.370
<i>Think of the implications
for totalitarian regimes.</i>


1202
01:12:21.454 --> 01:12:23.039
No more rigged elections.

1203
01:12:23.122 --> 01:12:25.225
The UN can demand
that they're held through the Circle.


1204
01:12:25.249 --> 01:12:28.252
- But only if everyone is heard.
- [murmuring]


1205
01:12:28.336 --> 01:12:31.088
Every human on Earth.

1206
01:12:31.172 --> 01:12:33.174
We can take the pulse of the nation,

1207
01:12:33.257 --> 01:12:36.761
<i>everyone in the world in seconds
on any subject.</i>


1208
01:12:36.844 --> 01:12:39.013
- It's the only way, right?
- Right.


1209
01:12:39.096 --> 01:12:40.348
[all] Yeah!

1210
01:12:43.100 --> 01:12:47.188
So it looks like
I've got 20 minutes here.

1211
01:12:47.271 --> 01:12:49.732
Let's try Mom and Dad.

1212
01:12:52.568 --> 01:12:54.129
- [line ringing]
- [man 1] Hey, Mae, what's up?


1213
01:12:54.153 --> 01:12:55.154
- Hi.
- [laughter]


1214
01:13:01.118 --> 01:13:03.621
- Hey, where have you been?
<i>- Mae.</i>


1215
01:13:03.704 --> 01:13:06.874
I've seen your cameras aren't working.
I can send Tech out...


1216
01:13:06.958 --> 01:13:09.502
<i>Yeah, we disconnected them.</i>

1217
01:13:09.585 --> 01:13:11.128
<i>- Sweetheart...</i>
<i>-</i>[sighs]


1218
01:13:12.296 --> 01:13:15.675
<i>We're sorry, but we,
we can't keep doing this.</i>


1219
01:13:15.758 --> 01:13:19.470
<i>It's... Well, it's more than we ever...</i>

1220
01:13:19.554 --> 01:13:22.640
[Mom] <i>You know we love you,</i>
<i>and we don't wanna...</i>


1221
01:13:22.723 --> 01:13:26.978
<i>- We love you. We love you.
- We have to have our privacy.</i>


1222
01:13:27.061 --> 01:13:30.565
<i>And we're worried you don't realize
what you've gotten yourself into.</i>


1223
01:13:30.648 --> 01:13:31.691
I'm so sorry.

1224
01:13:32.817 --> 01:13:34.110
I didn't mean to hurt you.

1225
01:13:34.193 --> 01:13:36.129
- [Dad] <i>It's not you. It's us.</i>
<i>- No, we know that.</i>


1226
01:13:36.153 --> 01:13:39.115
<i>- Yeah, it's us.
- We just need you to understand that.</i>


1227
01:13:39.198 --> 01:13:40.199
[sighs]

1228
01:13:41.951 --> 01:13:45.079
- I love you.
<i>- We love you too.</i>


1229
01:13:45.162 --> 01:13:46.162
<i>Bye, honey.</i>

1230
01:13:47.874 --> 01:13:49.375
[sniffles]

1231
01:13:49.458 --> 01:13:52.219
<i>-</i>[man] You're the one, Mae!
- [woman] You're changing the world, Mae!


1232
01:13:59.010 --> 01:14:01.470
[sighs]

1233
01:14:01.554 --> 01:14:03.556
[crowd cheering, applauding]

1234
01:14:04.891 --> 01:14:07.476
[man hooting]

1235
01:14:10.271 --> 01:14:14.984
- Hello, everyone. I'm Mae Holland.
- [crowd cheering, applauding]


1236
01:14:18.446 --> 01:14:21.574
[laughs] Okay.

1237
01:14:21.657 --> 01:14:25.286
We've had some good weeks
thinking about Completion,


1238
01:14:25.369 --> 01:14:28.539
envisioning a day when everyone
is in the Circle,


1239
01:14:28.623 --> 01:14:32.585
when all of humanity
is connected and united.


1240
01:14:33.669 --> 01:14:35.338
And it will happen.

1241
01:14:35.421 --> 01:14:37.882
Already, 22 nations have agreed
in principle


1242
01:14:37.965 --> 01:14:41.218
to operate their elections
through the Circle


1243
01:14:41.302 --> 01:14:46.140
with mandatory participation
from all of its citizens.


1244
01:14:46.223 --> 01:14:49.477
[crowd cheering, applauding]

1245
01:14:52.104 --> 01:14:57.652
And when everyone is united,
everyone is known, heard, accountable,


1246
01:14:58.903 --> 01:15:00.571
they can be better served.

1247
01:15:00.655 --> 01:15:05.117
But what about the people
who aren't part of the Circle,


1248
01:15:05.201 --> 01:15:08.621
who don't want to be woven
into the fabric of society


1249
01:15:08.704 --> 01:15:12.333
or worse, want to tear out that fabric?

1250
01:15:13.334 --> 01:15:17.546
I want to introduce Soul Search.

1251
01:15:17.630 --> 01:15:21.592
And we're putting it to the test
in front of the entire Circle audience,


1252
01:15:21.676 --> 01:15:24.971
here and globally.

1253
01:15:25.054 --> 01:15:26.055
Do you feel ready?

1254
01:15:26.138 --> 01:15:28.182
- [woman] Hell, yeah!
- [all cheering]


1255
01:15:28.265 --> 01:15:29.850
[Tom] <i>You went well so far.</i>

1256
01:15:29.934 --> 01:15:31.018
<i>Great.</i>

1257
01:15:33.562 --> 01:15:38.651
In seconds, the computer will select,
at random, a fugitive from justice,


1258
01:15:38.734 --> 01:15:42.154
a proven menace to our global community.

1259
01:15:43.322 --> 01:15:46.325
Our assertion is that
whoever he or she is,


1260
01:15:46.409 --> 01:15:50.746
Soul Search will locate them
in under 20 minutes.


1261
01:15:50.830 --> 01:15:52.707
- [woman] Wow.
- [crowd applauding]


1262
01:15:56.085 --> 01:15:57.712
Let's select that fugitive.

1263
01:15:59.463 --> 01:16:01.048
Okay.

1264
01:16:01.132 --> 01:16:03.718
This is Fiona Highbridge,

1265
01:16:03.801 --> 01:16:06.721
44 years old born in Manchester, England.

1266
01:16:06.804 --> 01:16:10.099
She was convicted
of triple murder in 2004.


1267
01:16:10.182 --> 01:16:12.601
She locked her three children
in the closet


1268
01:16:13.644 --> 01:16:15.938
and went on holiday to Spain.

1269
01:16:16.022 --> 01:16:18.149
[crowd murmuring]

1270
01:16:18.232 --> 01:16:19.483
They all starved.

1271
01:16:21.277 --> 01:16:23.529
She was sent to prison in England
but escaped


1272
01:16:23.612 --> 01:16:26.657
with the help of a guard
who she apparently seduced.


1273
01:16:28.325 --> 01:16:32.663
Over a billion people are watching.

1274
01:16:32.747 --> 01:16:34.623
Let's see how many are in the UK.

1275
01:16:36.208 --> 01:16:38.919
Do you all think 14 million Brits

1276
01:16:39.003 --> 01:16:41.714
and a billion global
participants worldwide


1277
01:16:41.797 --> 01:16:45.009
can find Fiona Highbridge
in under 20 minutes?


1278
01:16:45.092 --> 01:16:46.412
- [crowd cheering]
- [woman] Yeah!


1279
01:16:47.803 --> 01:16:49.722
[man] Yeah!

1280
01:16:49.805 --> 01:16:51.849
All right.

1281
01:16:51.932 --> 01:16:53.517
Let's bring up the clock.

1282
01:16:54.518 --> 01:16:56.228
Good.

1283
01:16:56.312 --> 01:16:59.690
- Is everyone ready?
- [crowd cheering]


1284
01:16:59.774 --> 01:17:01.150
On your mark...

1285
01:17:02.818 --> 01:17:03.903
get set...

1286
01:17:05.237 --> 01:17:06.072
go!

1287
01:17:06.155 --> 01:17:09.867
[crowd continuously cheering]

1288
01:17:09.950 --> 01:17:10.951
[laughter]

1289
01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:16.248
Okay, time to get serious.

1290
01:17:45.694 --> 01:17:46.779
[woman] <i>I've got her, Mae.</i>

1291
01:17:46.862 --> 01:17:48.239
[crowd applauding]

1292
01:17:48.322 --> 01:17:49.322
<i>That's her.</i>

1293
01:17:50.241 --> 01:17:52.201
Be careful.

1294
01:17:52.284 --> 01:17:53.284
<i>I will.</i>

1295
01:18:00.334 --> 01:18:03.546
- [crowd cheering]
- [man] Whoa!


1296
01:18:04.713 --> 01:18:05.713
[man] Whoa!

1297
01:18:14.515 --> 01:18:16.100
[woman] <i>Fiona! Stop!</i>

1298
01:18:17.184 --> 01:18:20.229
- Follow her.
<i>- Stop her!</i>


1299
01:18:20.312 --> 01:18:21.939
<i>Somebody stop her! 
She's a killer!</i>

1300
01:18:23.232 --> 01:18:24.233
<i>Stop her!</i>

1301
01:18:25.234 --> 01:18:26.527
<i>Somebody stop her!</i>

1302
01:18:28.028 --> 01:18:29.738
- [woman] Go!
- [man] Grab her!


1303
01:18:32.867 --> 01:18:34.743
<i>Stop her!</i>

1304
01:18:34.827 --> 01:18:36.954
<i>Somebody grab her!</i>

1305
01:18:37.037 --> 01:18:39.540
- [Tom] <i>She must be kept safe.</i>
- Keep her safe.


1306
01:18:39.623 --> 01:18:42.877
<i>- It's Fiona Highbridge!</i>
<i>-</i>[Fiona] <i>No! No! No!</i>


1307
01:18:42.960 --> 01:18:44.753
[crowd cheering, applauding]

1308
01:18:45.754 --> 01:18:48.757
[indistinct chattering]

1309
01:18:55.139 --> 01:18:56.223
[man] <i>All right. Watch it.</i>

1310
01:18:58.893 --> 01:18:59.727
[Fiona] <i>No.</i>

1311
01:18:59.810 --> 01:19:01.437
[crowd cheering]

1312
01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:02.520
Stop the clock.

1313
01:19:05.107 --> 01:19:06.400
[woman] Soul Search, baby!

1314
01:19:06.483 --> 01:19:08.944
- I guess that's it.
- [crowd cheering and applauding]


1315
01:19:18.662 --> 01:19:21.081
[woman] Let's do another!

1316
01:19:21.165 --> 01:19:22.166
We could.

1317
01:19:23.500 --> 01:19:25.312
- Um...
- [Tom] <i>Maybe not a fugitive this time.</i>


1318
01:19:25.336 --> 01:19:27.296
Let's try for a regular civilian.

1319
01:19:28.756 --> 01:19:30.591
Okay, everyone.

1320
01:19:30.674 --> 01:19:33.469
We're gonna find a regular person.

1321
01:19:34.470 --> 01:19:36.597
It can be anyone.

1322
01:19:36.680 --> 01:19:39.558
A relative, a lost love.

1323
01:19:39.642 --> 01:19:44.438
When everyone can be found,
we can never lose a friend.


1324
01:19:46.398 --> 01:19:48.234
We can take a suggestion
from the audience.


1325
01:19:48.317 --> 01:19:52.321
- Uh... anyone?
- [woman] Find Mercer!


1326
01:19:52.404 --> 01:19:55.366
[laughter, hooting]

1327
01:19:55.449 --> 01:19:57.868
I'm pretty sure
he doesn't wanna be found. [chuckles]


1328
01:19:59.245 --> 01:20:00.913
- Anyone else?
- [man] Where's Mercer?


1329
01:20:00.996 --> 01:20:05.292
[Tom] <i>No, Mae, this is what Soul Search</i>
<i>is all about as well as Completion.</i>


1330
01:20:05.376 --> 01:20:06.377
Other suggestions?

1331
01:20:06.460 --> 01:20:08.313
- [woman] Let's try Mercer.
- [crowd] Mercer! Mercer! Mercer!


1332
01:20:08.337 --> 01:20:09.356
<i>It's the whole point
of Soul Search, Mae.</i>


1333
01:20:09.380 --> 01:20:10.214
No.

1334
01:20:10.297 --> 01:20:12.508
[crowd] Mercer! Mercer!

1335
01:20:12.591 --> 01:20:14.486
- Mercer! Mercer! Mercer!
- [Mae] No, no, no, no.


1336
01:20:14.510 --> 01:20:16.178
No, I...

1337
01:20:16.262 --> 01:20:18.681
[Tom] <i>Mae, this is the right choice.</i>

1338
01:20:18.764 --> 01:20:21.058
[Eamon] Wait. Hey, everybody.

1339
01:20:21.141 --> 01:20:23.021
- [crowd cheering and applauding]
- [Eamon] Hey.


1340
01:20:23.560 --> 01:20:25.896
I think it's time we reunited
Mae and Mercer, don't you?


1341
01:20:25.980 --> 01:20:26.814
[crowd cheering]

1342
01:20:26.897 --> 01:20:29.108
All right then.
And through the power of the Circle,


1343
01:20:29.191 --> 01:20:31.694
let's bring them
back together again, okay?


1344
01:20:31.777 --> 01:20:35.531
The perfect use of Soul Search.
Let's find your friend.


1345
01:20:35.614 --> 01:20:38.033
[crowd cheering, applauding]

1346
01:20:38.117 --> 01:20:39.368
Go, Mae, now.

1347
01:20:49.878 --> 01:20:52.339
Okay.

1348
01:20:55.384 --> 01:21:01.557
So our second Soul Search today
involves not a fugitive from justice,


1349
01:21:01.640 --> 01:21:04.059
but you might say a fugitive from, um...

1350
01:21:05.394 --> 01:21:06.228
a friendship.

1351
01:21:06.312 --> 01:21:08.480
[laughter]

1352
01:21:14.486 --> 01:21:16.322
This is my friend Mercer.

1353
01:21:17.364 --> 01:21:19.950
I haven't seen him in a while.

1354
01:21:20.034 --> 01:21:21.327
I'd love to see him again.

1355
01:21:22.494 --> 01:21:27.708
Like Fiona, though, he is someone
who is trying not to be found,


1356
01:21:27.791 --> 01:21:29.793
but unlike Fiona, he's not a criminal.

1357
01:21:31.337 --> 01:21:32.504
He's good, people.

1358
01:21:40.304 --> 01:21:42.144
Let's see if we can break
our previous record.


1359
01:21:42.181 --> 01:21:43.849
Whoo!

1360
01:21:59.740 --> 01:22:02.284
[breathes heavily]

1361
01:22:04.703 --> 01:22:06.413
- [crowd cheering]
- [man] Oh, yeah.


1362
01:22:07.414 --> 01:22:08.791
Unbelievable.

1363
01:22:08.874 --> 01:22:10.793
Can you believe that? Yes!

1364
01:22:13.003 --> 01:22:14.546
[man] <i>Do you think he's in here?</i>

1365
01:22:17.341 --> 01:22:19.134
<i>- Mercer!</i>
- [man] <i>Mercer!</i>


1366
01:22:19.218 --> 01:22:20.135
<i>Mercer, are you in there?</i>

1367
01:22:20.219 --> 01:22:22.888
<i>Are you, like, killing deer,
making chandeliers?</i>


1368
01:22:22.971 --> 01:22:24.723
[audience laughing]

1369
01:22:24.807 --> 01:22:27.660
[woman] <i>Mercer, we know you're in there.</i>
<i>We see your truck. It's right here.</i>


1370
01:22:27.684 --> 01:22:29.537
- [man] <i>I think he's in there.</i>
<i>- Fine. Let's go around.</i>


1371
01:22:29.561 --> 01:22:32.815
- [woman] <i>Oh, my God, he's in there!</i>
- [crowd laughing]


1372
01:22:32.898 --> 01:22:34.775

to offer you a new role

here at the Circle
with no formal obligation,

01:32:25.448 --> 01:32:27.409
maybe a lighter schedule.

1517
01:32:27.492 --> 01:32:29.994
You can choose your own projects,
and you can think long-term.

- but one of our founders, Ty Lafitte...
- Yeah.

and now he loves his freedom.

And I don't know
if this is any consolation,

01:33:04.404 --> 01:33:05.488
thanks for the invitation.

1529
01:33:06.489 --> 01:33:07.489
Take your time.

[cell phone buzzing]

1532
01:33:33.141 --> 01:33:36.519
I did what you asked.
You won't believe the shit I found.


1533
01:33:36.603 --> 01:33:41.024
It's worse than I could've imagined.
And, and look, Mae, I'm so sorry.


1534
01:33:41.107 --> 01:33:44.986
I never met him, but they should build
a monument to Mercer.


1535
01:33:47.238 --> 01:33:50.909
- Yeah.
- I mean, this... this changes everything.


1536
01:33:50.992 --> 01:33:54.037
Okay, he's the martyr
who will wake everyone up, right?


1537
01:33:54.120 --> 01:33:57.582
I don't know what you're planning,
but if you turn that camera back on,


1538
01:33:57.665 --> 01:34:00.585
whatever you say about the Circle
is heard around the world,


1539
01:34:00.668 --> 01:34:02.295
and it changes everything.

1543

And that is how it should have been,

1544
01:34:41.668 --> 01:34:44.170
how it could've been,
but we didn't have the technology.


1545
01:34:44.254 --> 01:34:45.505
But we will.

1546
01:34:45.588 --> 01:34:46.965
And when we do,

1547
01:34:47.048 --> 01:34:50.343
when every vehicle
is known and connected,


1548
01:34:50.426 --> 01:34:53.763
the data we have will help us
improve traffic patterns,


1549
01:34:53.847 --> 01:35:00.436
keep drivers safe, and optimize
Circle services across all platforms.

- Mae, come on out here.

<i>Oh, you're transparent again.
Look at that.</i>


1556
01:35:14.701 --> 01:35:16.870
Hello, hello.

1557
01:35:16.953 --> 01:35:17.953
Mae Holland.

1558
01:35:17.996 --> 01:35:21.499
- [crowd cheering]
- [man] Welcome back, Mae!


1559
01:35:21.583 --> 01:35:26.963
Now, Mae is a brave person

1560
01:35:27.046 --> 01:35:28.882
because even amid her grieving,

1561
01:35:28.965 --> 01:35:33.803
she knows that she has a responsibility
to her followers,


1562
01:35:33.887 --> 01:35:35.430
to the whole world, really.

1563
01:35:37.015 --> 01:35:41.436
Thanks for saying that, Eamon.
And I couldn't agree with you more.


1564
01:35:42.854 --> 01:35:45.773
I know that Tom, he agrees, too.

1565
01:35:45.857 --> 01:35:49.944
- Right, Tom? You want to come out?
- [crowd applauding]


1566
01:35:50.028 --> 01:35:52.655
- Come on.
- There you are.


1567
01:35:56.618 --> 01:36:00.121
First, I want to thank everyone here
and around the world


1568
01:36:00.204 --> 01:36:03.541
for the support you've given me
since we lost Mercer.


1569
01:36:03.625 --> 01:36:08.379
These past days,
I've realized something about myself


1570
01:36:08.463 --> 01:36:09.631
and about the Circle.

1571
01:36:10.798 --> 01:36:13.134
It's that I don't want to be disconnected.

1572
01:36:14.552 --> 01:36:18.514
I don't want to have to search
for friends, family, my loved ones.


1573
01:36:19.724 --> 01:36:21.225
We lost track of Mercer.

1574
01:36:22.769 --> 01:36:25.355
But what if we never lost touch
with each other?


1575
01:36:27.565 --> 01:36:29.359
What if instead of searching...

1576
01:36:30.693 --> 01:36:31.861
we always knew?

1577
01:36:33.988 --> 01:36:38.910
What I am proposing is radical openness
and unbroken connection.


1578
01:36:41.663 --> 01:36:43.623
It would have to start here.

1579
01:36:43.706 --> 01:36:45.375
- [crowd applauding]
- Mm-hm.


1580
01:36:45.458 --> 01:36:48.836
You know the usual hypocrisy
of the digital world.


1581
01:36:48.920 --> 01:36:53.091
We want everything in the Cloud,
and yet our leaders...


1582
01:36:55.051 --> 01:36:56.886
live above it.

1583
01:36:56.970 --> 01:37:01.599
So I want to invite Eamon and Tom

1584
01:37:01.683 --> 01:37:06.062
to join me in this experiment
that they've pioneered.


1585
01:37:07.689 --> 01:37:13.444
I invite them to set an example
for the Circle and the world...


1586
01:37:16.531 --> 01:37:18.074
to go transparent.

1587
01:37:18.157 --> 01:37:19.317
[crowd cheering, applauding]

1588
01:37:22.787 --> 01:37:24.372
What do you say, guys?

1589
01:37:26.374 --> 01:37:27.375
Will you join me?

1590
01:37:34.507 --> 01:37:38.511
Wouldn't it be great to know
their every move, their every word?


1591
01:37:38.594 --> 01:37:42.974
From now on,
every message, meeting, phone call,


1592
01:37:43.057 --> 01:37:48.312
all will be public,
knowable, never erased.


1593
01:37:49.480 --> 01:37:51.649
In fact, Ty Lafitte has helped us
make every document


1594
01:37:51.733 --> 01:37:55.361
in the company's history public.

1595
01:37:55.445 --> 01:37:57.989
Every message, every plan including...

1596
01:37:58.072 --> 01:38:01.325
And this is my favorite part,
every e-mail,


1597
01:38:01.409 --> 01:38:05.455
from Tom and Eamon's accounts,
and their private accounts...

[crowd murmuring]

1599
01:38:06.456 --> 01:38:08.642
...and their secondary
confidential accounts. [chuckles]


1600
01:38:08.666 --> 01:38:12.628
And even their super-secret
scrambled code accounts,


1601
01:38:12.712 --> 01:38:18.634
that nobody, not even their assistants
or wives knew existed.


1602
01:38:20.136 --> 01:38:21.262
Until now.

1603
01:38:24.223 --> 01:38:26.100
It's all been sent to you already.

1604

We are so fucked.

01:38:32.023 --> 01:38:35.943
I think we're entitled
to that kind of access. Don't you?


1607
01:38:36.027 --> 01:38:39.447
- [all] Yeah.
- [hooting]


1608
01:38:40.573 --> 01:38:42.742
Mae, you are a very brave woman
to do this.


1609
01:38:48.623 --> 01:38:51.709
There are no more secrets.

1610
01:38:51.793 --> 01:38:53.544
Privacy was a temporary thing.

1611
01:38:54.754 --> 01:38:55.838
And now it's over.

1612
01:38:57.590 --> 01:38:59.759
We won't live in the shadows anymore.

1613
01:39:01.177 --> 01:39:03.387
Hey. Good timing. [chuckles]

Thank you.

I'm tired of hiding,
these passwords and secret knocks,


1619
01:39:34.001 --> 01:39:36.796
the difference between public and private.

1620
01:39:38.422 --> 01:39:39.465
Aren't you all?

1621
01:39:40.883 --> 01:39:42.844
Come to think of it,

1622
01:39:42.927 --> 01:39:44.846
I'm tired of standing here in the dark.

1623
01:39:46.806 --> 01:39:48.015
Don't worry.

1624
01:39:48.099 --> 01:39:52.895
Eamon will catch up. 
Or maybe he won't.

1625
01:39:52.979 --> 01:39:55.731
Either way, it's time for a change.

1626
01:39:55.815 --> 01:39:57.733
We're gonna remake this place.

1627
01:39:57.817 --> 01:40:03.406
And if we do it right,
we will set an example for everyone.


1628

The future won't wait.
