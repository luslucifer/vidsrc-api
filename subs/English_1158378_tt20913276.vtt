1
00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.710
"Let's dance, baby..."

2
00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:55.230
Bro, stop...

3
00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:56.630
Stop.

4
00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.230
What a lucky umpire.

5
00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:06.510
I swear, man.

6
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.310
She'll look so good running
in slow motion...


7
00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.350
No wonder women's cricket is so popular.

8
00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:16.910
Play with us too, madam.

9
00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.350
Let us bat...

10
00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:19.270
on your pitch!

11
00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.950
Hi.

12
00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.230
- She's mine.
- No, mine.


13
00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.870
Bro...

14
00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:38.270
Bro.

15
00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.030
Sorry guys, women power
is on the rise.


16
00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:46.430
If you hit on us,
we'll have to hit back.


17
00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.470
Next time, wear a helmet
and watch.


18
00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:52.710
Let's go.

19
00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:11.670
Ani...

20
00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:14.870
When you fall sick...

21
00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:16.750
what will you eat?

22
00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.150
Opposite case...

23
00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:19.870
she'll eat butter chicken then.

24
00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.030
What do stock market players know
about fitness!


25
00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:24.790
- Pull your paunch in.
- Granny!


26
00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.070
Hot hot 'parathas'...

27
00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:30.510
Niku, get a DNA
test done for these two.

28
00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.030
They can't be my grandsons.

29
00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.830
Two more.

30
00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:33.950
Let them eat, Granny.

31
00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:36.550
There's just a one letter difference
between fitness and fatness.


32
00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.030
And they are fatness freaks.

33
00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:40.270
How was the match, Ani?

34
00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.110
104 runs in 83 balls.
We won by 8 wickets!


35
00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:45.270
You're the best.

36
00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.750
You know, Chris Gayle scored a century
in only 30 balls.


37
00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:51.670
Even my mutual funds have matured...

38
00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:52.710
when will you?

39
00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:54.990
Tishu, that was a T20 game.

40
00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:56.670
Ani played a one-day match.

41
00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.670
In a 50 over game
one has to play 50 overs.


42
00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.350
Special forces act perpendicular
to the surface


43
00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:16.670
and the formula is -

44
00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.270
Force on the body is the
vector sum of the pressure


45
00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:21.470
multiplied by the area
around the body.


46
00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:26.110
What's the score?

47
00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:28.070
Sorry, sir...

48
00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:29.390
What's the score?

49
00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.310
It's... 118 for 8.

50
00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:33.510
English conditions...

51
00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:36.590
swinging ball... they can't play.

52
00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:38.990
- Who took the wickets?
- Joe Root.


53
00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.030
Can't even play spin bowling!

54
00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:43.910
- I tell you, if we had --
- Sir...


55
00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:46.670
Sir, can we please get back to Physics?

56
00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:48.990
We've half an hour of class left...

57
00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:50.310
please watch the match after that.

58
00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:53.190
Anina, you're a cricketer but
you have no interest in cricket?


59
00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:56.030
I'm interested in cricket, sir...
that's why I'm studying Physics.


60
00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:00.150
Ball trajectories are based
on the dynamics of a moving object


61
00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:01.590
and the effect of atmospheric pressure

62
00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:03.630
and thrust force on a rotating
spherical object...


63
00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:06.590
Please teach me Physics, sir
so I can play spin and swing better.


64
00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:17.390
Head position is so perfect.

65
00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:19.350
So technically perfect, yet...

66
00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:21.510
her strike rate is always above 120.

67
00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:24.430
I think she's ready to play for India.

68
00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:26.750
Let her play for the state first.

69
00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:31.310
If you ring the bell so loudly,
how will God hear your prayers?


70
00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:39.510
'Some spinach leaves... adding
some mint for a nice, cooling effect.'


71
00:08:41.550 --> 00:08:42.630
'Some ginger...'

72
00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:50.390
'Lemon juice, few celery sticks...'

73
00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:54.710
Ani, your omelette is getting cold.

74
00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:58.550
Concentration-booster smoothie.

75
00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:00.390
To help you focus.

76
00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:04.710
Formula 1 racer Lewis Hamilton
also drinks this formula.


77
00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:06.430
Ani...

78
00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:09.310
One minute...
let me first call an ambulance.


79
00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:11.990
Call... someone's about to have
a heart attack.


80
00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:13.630
Eat eat...

81
00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:16.950
This is readily available in England.

82
00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:17.910
England?

83
00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:21.670
Today, the list of 24 probables
for the English tour will be announced.


84
00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:23.150
Chill, Granny.

85
00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:26.270
I've just started playing state-level.
There's still time.


86
00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:28.230
Mr Morey - the selector,
was watching.


87
00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:30.230
When you raised your bat
on scoring 50,


88
00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:32.830
he applauded the most.

89
00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:37.030
David Warner, without ever playing
state-level matches...


90
00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:38.550
was selected directly
for the Australian team.


91
00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:40.030
Times have changed.

92
00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:43.950
The world of cricket is hungry
for special talent.


93
00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:46.630
A piece of professional advice...

94
00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:50.150
Concentrate on your concentration.

95
00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:52.790
Why do you get so excited
when you see a spinner?


96
00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:56.270
T20 generation!

97
00:09:56.950 --> 00:09:57.830
Cheers!

98
00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:33.030
"My heart spins like a wheel"

99
00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:39.030
"Spinning all around you"

100
00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:44.190
"My heart spins like a reel"

101
00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:50.390
"Spinning even when it's cut loose"

102
00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:57.110
"My heart searches for you..."

103
00:10:57.350 --> 00:11:02.470
"Spinning around your neighbourhood"

104
00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:08.830
"My heart follows you,
wagging its tail"


105
00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:14.390
"My heart follows you,
wagging its tail"


106
00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:20.830
"My heart follows you around,
wagging its tail"


107
00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:30.070
Isn't this your grandpa's car?

108
00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:32.350
It was. I pocketed it
after he popped it.


109
00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:42.270
I missed you, Ani.

110
00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:44.830
Life is so strange...

111
00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:46.870
As kids, we spent every day together

112
00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:48.470
then suddenly life takes over

113
00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:50.430
and we go our different ways.

114
00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:52.870
And then one day,

115
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:55.430
suddenly we meet again.

116
00:11:56.910 --> 00:11:58.630
Feels like we've been meeting every day.

117
00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:01.150
Really?

118
00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:02.830
Stop the car.

119
00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:03.830
What!

120
00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:08.350
What are you doing?

121
00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:10.110
Ani, you're spoiling my hair!

122
00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:11.550
Is this how you behave?

123
00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:12.870
What's going on?
Hitting a girl?


124
00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:14.710
The girl is hitting me, man!

125
00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:17.630
- Did I ask you for help?
- Crazy girl...


126
00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:22.390
Were you in a coma all these years,
you rascal?


127
00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:25.910
You'd follow me around
like a puppy every day


128
00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:28.510
then you showed your true colors
after moving to USA, you dog.


129
00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:29.710
Ani...

130
00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:34.430
Had to check out my options in USA.

131
00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:41.870
Now it feels like we've been meeting
every day!


132
00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:44.950
How long are you here for?

133
00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:47.150
As long as I'm alive!

134
00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:01.430
Want me to drag you in?

135
00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:10.670
Hello?

136
00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:13.310
Yes sir, this is Anina.

137
00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:19.030
Thank you, sir.

138
00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:20.110
Yes, sir.

139
00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:21.710
Granny...

140
00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:22.910
Dad!

141
00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:23.870
I made it.

142
00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:26.070
I made it to the Indian team
probables for the England tour.


143
00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:28.590
I am so proud of you.

144
00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:30.150
Granny...

145
00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:35.630
Don't cry, it's time to make
the opposition cry.


146
00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:39.270
I've fully analyzed the English bowlers.

147
00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:40.670
Their spinning department is weak.

148
00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:42.830
Their biggest advantage is the weather.

149
00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:45.550
Average seamers become
as good as Wasim and Waqar.


150
00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:48.630
Bless you.

151
00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:49.910
And who are you?

152
00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:53.070
Remember Jeet, Granny?

153
00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:58.190
Puppy love still following you around?

154
00:14:00.190 --> 00:14:00.790
Come.

155
00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:04.030
Give me your hand, Ani.

156
00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:07.270
What is this?

157
00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:08.590
Superstition.

158
00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:11.030
I've been praying for three months now

159
00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:12.790
that's why she has been selected.

160
00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:15.190
This sacred thread is more powerful
than a bat.


161
00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:17.630
You'll see, she'll score a century
in her very first match!


162
00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:19.630
For that, I have to be selected
in the team first.


163
00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:21.430
This is only a list
of the probables.


164
00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:23.550
I don't know if I'll make it
to the 16.


165
00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:26.510
- I don't believe in all this rubbish.
- I believe in it.


166
00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:29.310
Bribing a God for his daughter!

167
00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:31.590
Mohinder Amarnath always kept
a red handkerchief


168
00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:33.030
in his pocket, while batting.

169
00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:40.270
And 'Dada'... Sourav Ganguly...

170
00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:42.950
would keep his guru's photo
in his pocket.


171
00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:46.310
Sachin... always wore
his left pad first.


172
00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:49.830
Legends and superstition
seem to be made for each other.


173
00:14:51.190 --> 00:14:52.630
G.R. Vishwanath?

174
00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:56.510
India's real legend, who played
before you were even born.


175
00:14:57.110 --> 00:15:01.310
To face Andy Roberts without a helmet,
you need self-belief


176
00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:02.590
not superstition!

177
00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:06.550
Keep it on only
if you score a 100.

178
00:15:07.270 --> 00:15:10.190
- You?
- Hello, Uncle... Jeet. Remember me?


179
00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:11.510
Jeet?

180
00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:16.070
Didn't Ani break your teeth once?

181
00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:24.550
Ma'am is here.

182
00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:27.030
I'm so sorry. Too much traffic.

183
00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:28.790
Don't apologize, ma'am.

184
00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:30.950
The Chairman of Selectors can be late.

185
00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:35.070
Hello.

186
00:15:35.190 --> 00:15:37.950
Coach, after the 15-day camp...
what's your feeling?


187
00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:39.710
Who's fit? Who isn't?

188
00:15:39.830 --> 00:15:41.630
Tell us and make our jobs easier.

189
00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:43.270
Sorry, ma'am, all the girls
are super fit.


190
00:15:43.390 --> 00:15:45.030
So, it's going to be a long day.

191
00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:48.430
It's my job to make your job difficult.

192
00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:50.830
All of them are good enough
to be in the final 16.


193
00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:51.830
Let's begin.

194
00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:06.750
She has so much time...

195
00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:11.670
plays the ball so late.

196
00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:16.310
She'll do well in English conditions.

197
00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:34.230
Who is he?
Why is he on the field?


198
00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:36.310
Ma'am, that's Paddy sir.

199
00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:37.950
Padam Singh Sodhi.

200
00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:40.190
He played a Test match
in the 90s.


201
00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:41.750
But what is he doing here?

202
00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:46.990
Please tell him, team selection
is going on. He can't be there.


203
00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:49.430
Hello... you are?

204
00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:51.870
Anina.

205
00:16:53.190 --> 00:16:54.070
And you, sir?

206
00:16:56.590 --> 00:16:57.630
You don't know who I am?

207
00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:00.790
Shame.

208
00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:03.750
I'm thirsty...

209
00:17:08.590 --> 00:17:09.510
The thirst to play.

210
00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:16.670
- Is that working?
- What, sir?


211
00:17:20.590 --> 00:17:21.990
Sir, that's just--

212
00:17:22.590 --> 00:17:24.390
It's a beautiful morning for cricket.

213
00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:25.310
Sir, sir...

214
00:17:26.350 --> 00:17:27.990
One ball. Just one ball.

215
00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:31.870
Sir, selections are going on...

216
00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:34.190
Sure... I didn't think
elections are going on.


217
00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:35.590
Let me bowl one ball.

218
00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:38.190
Seeing this amazing
batswoman play


219
00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:40.070
I felt like bowling, after 20 years.

220
00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:43.470
After all, the greatest motivation
for a bowler is a good batsman.


221
00:17:43.790 --> 00:17:44.830
Just... one ball.

222
00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:46.590
Sir, you'll have to leave.

223
00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:49.310
You'll have to leave now.

224
00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:51.670
Come.

225
00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:54.950
Sir!

226
00:17:56.110 --> 00:17:57.150
What is he doing there?

227
00:17:57.270 --> 00:17:58.510
Please get him out.

228
00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:01.110
Sorry. Not ready.

229
00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:03.510
Batswoman not ready, sir.
Dead ball.


230
00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:04.310
One more.

231
00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:07.910
Sir... you are disturbing our players.

232
00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:10.150
- Please leave or else--
- Or else what?


233
00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:14.790
You'll throw me out
and I'll be okay with it?


234
00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:16.990
See, boss...

235
00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:21.830
It's Happy Hour at the Club bar.

236
00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:25.510
I ordered two large drinks and downed
four before coming here.


237
00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:28.030
There will be a scuffle...

238
00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:30.510
anything may happen...

239
00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:32.950
to me.

240
00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:36.110
Then you'll have to call an ambulance

241
00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:37.790
there'll be a lot of drama.

242
00:18:37.910 --> 00:18:39.750
The selectors' time will be wasted.

243
00:18:40.550 --> 00:18:42.270
Just one ball. Two minutes.

244
00:18:42.550 --> 00:18:44.350
I'm a spinner...
won't even need a run up.


245
00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:45.910
One ball, please.

246
00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:47.430
Coach sir...

247
00:18:52.910 --> 00:18:54.230
He's a senior player, sir.

248
00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:56.350
Just one ball...

249
00:18:56.550 --> 00:18:58.390
What are you saying?
Selections are going on.


250
00:18:58.510 --> 00:19:00.430
Girls are playing. 
This is not okay.

251
00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:02.830
He'll bowl one delivery and leave.

252
00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:04.870
Please, sir. One ball.

253
00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:07.870
Just one ball.

254
00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:09.430
Thank you, my friend.

255
00:19:09.910 --> 00:19:10.830
Hello.

256
00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:13.430
Ready?

257
00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:32.990
Sir...

258
00:19:33.670 --> 00:19:34.670
One more ball, please... sir.

259
00:19:34.790 --> 00:19:35.990
- Anina.
- Please, sir.


260
00:19:37.030 --> 00:19:38.030
Was it a no-ball?

261
00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:39.310
No, right?

262
00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:40.910
Why should I bowl again?

263
00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:42.470
Lady with the sacred thread!

264
00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:44.070
In cricket, when you're out...

265
00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:45.430
you have to go out!

266
00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:46.390
What is happening?

267
00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:48.950
Selection is happening, ma'am.

268
00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:51.190
This girl... no!

269
00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:52.750
Hello, Mr Padam.

270
00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:55.310
You are?

271
00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:58.070
Rumi Vakeel, Chairman
of the selection committee.


272
00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:04.310
Get up from your chair...

273
00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:06.150
and bowl.

274
00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:08.750
You can gauge a batsman
in two minutes.


275
00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:11.030
Things are deceptive from a distance.

276
00:20:12.070 --> 00:20:14.590
All of you... bowl a ball each.

277
00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:17.070
Once you're done,
meet me at the bar.


278
00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:19.670
Happy Hour is on.

279
00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:21.750
I'll teach you how to select...

280
00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:24.550
the world's greatest whisky.

281
00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:29.550
Use your common sense

282
00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:31.150
young girls are playing.

283
00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:33.190
If you can't shut the club,
shut the bar at least!


284
00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:36.470
Every frustrated, failed cricketer
is given membership here.


285
00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:37.870
What do you expect?

286
00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:39.550
Girls, I'm sorry for the interruption.

287
00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:42.190
We'll carry on with the selection.
All right?


288
00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:44.150
Don't let this affect you.

289
00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:47.430
What does Happy Hour mean?

290
00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:50.350
Buy 1 get 1 free.

291
00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:51.510
So where is it?

292
00:20:52.110 --> 00:20:53.150
Right here, sir.

293
00:20:53.550 --> 00:20:54.950
This is free with this one.

294
00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:56.950
And with this one?

295
00:20:57.270 --> 00:20:58.710
This is free with this one, sir.

296
00:20:58.830 --> 00:21:00.470
This is free with this one.

297
00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:02.030
And with this one?

298
00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:03.190
Sir--

299
00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:07.110
This is a drink.
Where's the free one with this?


300
00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:15.070
Here. Free.

301
00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:17.390
- Rules are rules.
- Yeah.


302
00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:21.910
And the free one with this?

303
00:21:26.790 --> 00:21:27.950
Paddy brother...

304
00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:30.110
wake up, it's 2 p.m.

305
00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:32.670
Your tea will get cold
and then you'll say...


306
00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:34.630
puckall tea!

307
00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:41.830
First words in the morning
must be nice, Rasika.


308
00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:44.790
It's not P... it's F... F!

309
00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:47.430
Irritating!

310
00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:52.590
- I don't want to eat.
- You have to!


311
00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:54.910
- Why do I have to?
- If you don't, then--


312
00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:56.670
Then what? I'll die?

313
00:21:56.790 --> 00:21:57.950
How does it matter to you?

314
00:21:58.070 --> 00:21:59.910
You won't, I will die.

315
00:22:00.910 --> 00:22:01.670
What?

316
00:22:01.790 --> 00:22:04.390
If you're hungry...
you'll go and chew somebody's brain


317
00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:06.670
that brainless person will vote
for the wrong political party


318
00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:08.950
and the rights of people like me
will become 'wrong' again!


319
00:22:09.310 --> 00:22:11.990
Because of these two eggs
my life will be fried!


320
00:22:12.270 --> 00:22:13.270
So it's me who'll die, right?

321
00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:19.350
Why on earth did I adopt you
as my sister?


322
00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:22.110
And drink a little less...

323
00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:23.510
or else you'll die too!

324
00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:25.310
Drinking and dying

325
00:22:25.910 --> 00:22:27.870
is better than not drinking and dying.

326
00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:36.310
If there is less alcohol in the body
when dying


327
00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:40.030
a lot of wood will be needed
for cremating it.


328
00:22:40.270 --> 00:22:41.750
Many trees will need to be cut

329
00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:43.310
there will be global warming.

330
00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:47.710
So, in order to protect Mother Nature
and her children


331
00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:49.070
at the time of death

332
00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:51.270
the body should be full of alcohol.

333
00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:53.790
Just one strike of a match...

334
00:22:54.030 --> 00:22:54.750
Boom!

335
00:22:56.150 --> 00:22:58.190
Eco-friendly last rites!

336
00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:02.990
What a puckall thought!

337
00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:14.270
Your daughter has become
an Indian cricketer!


338
00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:15.750
See the miracle of the sacred thread!

339
00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:24.910
Not even one warm-up match?

340
00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:26.950
What is this planning
by the Cricket Board!


341
00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:29.590
Straightaway 5 one-day matches
and 2 T20s.


342
00:23:31.030 --> 00:23:31.750
Hello...

343
00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:32.910
Hello... Mama-ji!

344
00:23:33.030 --> 00:23:34.790
Ani has been selected
to play for India!!!


345
00:23:34.910 --> 00:23:36.110
No match at Lord's?

346
00:23:36.350 --> 00:23:38.910
Men play so many matches
at Lord's,


347
00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:40.070
why can't women get one!

348
00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:43.670
Hello Chacha-ji, Ani has been selected
to play for India.


349
00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:47.030
The whole world is going on
about equality,


350
00:23:47.230 --> 00:23:50.430
these chaps at Lord's are stuck
in the Lord Mountbatten era!


351
00:23:50.670 --> 00:23:53.710
Why would she play for England?
She will play for India.


352
00:23:53.950 --> 00:23:57.030
What is Bedford-shyre... 
Derby-shyre...

353
00:23:57.150 --> 00:23:58.830
- Buckingham-shyre...
- Shire.


354
00:23:59.870 --> 00:24:00.830
Bedfordshire.

355
00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:01.910
Derbyshire.

356
00:24:02.030 --> 00:24:03.150
Where else are the matches?

357
00:24:03.270 --> 00:24:05.470
Why? Want to book a double-room
in all these places?


358
00:24:05.670 --> 00:24:06.470
Aunty...

359
00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:08.390
Papa, how many relatives
will you broadcast this to?


360
00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:09.710
Not ticket... cricket!

361
00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:10.910
Hello...

362
00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:12.110
Hello...

363
00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:13.270
Sit down.

364
00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:15.190
- Or you'll lose your voice.
- Aunty...


365
00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:19.190
I understand a father's pride

366
00:24:20.190 --> 00:24:22.670
but this over-enthusiastic publicity

367
00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:24.910
can pressurize my player.

368
00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:29.310
The pressure of making
every family member proud


369
00:24:29.550 --> 00:24:31.150
can end up with her disappointing India!

370
00:25:09.070 --> 00:25:10.150
Two butter 'naans'.

371
00:25:10.270 --> 00:25:11.750
Is Jos Butler married?

372
00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:13.950
- I don't know.
- Google it.


373
00:25:14.190 --> 00:25:18.030
What if she and Jos have an affair
in England?


374
00:25:19.550 --> 00:25:20.630
You're single, aren't you, Granny?

375
00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:24.270
Go on. Kill me.

376
00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:25.030
Here.

377
00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:29.070
Who'll say thank you?

378
00:25:47.310 --> 00:25:48.670
Sir, you can't go inside.

379
00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:52.110
I'm a life member...
As long as I am living, I can.


380
00:25:52.790 --> 00:25:54.510
The women's team farewell dinner
is on.


381
00:25:55.350 --> 00:25:56.550
So, let it.

382
00:25:57.310 --> 00:25:58.750
I won't be eating off their plates!

383
00:25:58.870 --> 00:26:00.110
Sir, actually the club is closed today.

384
00:26:05.710 --> 00:26:07.110
Call the management.

385
00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:08.790
This is by order of the management, sir.

386
00:26:08.990 --> 00:26:11.190
Who is the management to stop me!

387
00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:14.390
This club is for cricketers
and I am a Test cricketer!


388
00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:16.350
I will throw the management out!

389
00:26:16.670 --> 00:26:19.070
Sir... please don't create
a scene today.


390
00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:21.710
There are ladies inside...
tomorrow onwards, the club is all yours.


391
00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:22.910
Sir, please...

392
00:26:23.030 --> 00:26:25.070
Don't... please, sir.

393
00:26:25.390 --> 00:26:26.870
Don't do what?

394
00:26:28.030 --> 00:26:29.030
What have I done?

395
00:26:29.150 --> 00:26:30.750
Seeing kids playing gully cricket...

396
00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:32.990
don't grown ups feel like
bowling a ball or two?


397
00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:36.350
Kids should be happy
that a Test cricketer bowled to them.


398
00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:37.910
Show some bloody respect!

399
00:26:38.110 --> 00:26:39.310
Sir, we do respect you...

400
00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:41.830
but you are making the girls
feel uncomfortable.


401
00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:46.230
Girls, am I 'uncomforting' you?

402
00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:54.110
Lady with the sacred thread,
you got selected?


403
00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:56.390
How?

404
00:26:57.870 --> 00:26:59.470
Did you get someone high up
to make a call?


405
00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:02.390
Or did you bribe someone?

406
00:27:05.070 --> 00:27:07.070
Because you certainly don't deserve
to be here.


407
00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:11.390
I love how this system works!

408
00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:13.630
A player who can't face a single ball...

409
00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:15.950
is being fed 'biryani'
and taken to England.


410
00:27:16.150 --> 00:27:17.510
And the one who took her wicket

411
00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:19.190
isn't even being allowed
to go to the bar.


412
00:27:19.310 --> 00:27:22.470
I will not leave without my drink!

413
00:27:23.670 --> 00:27:26.350
Sir, one more word against my players...

414
00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:27.590
and there'll be no one worse than me.

415
00:27:27.790 --> 00:27:29.550
No one can be worse than you.

416
00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:32.790
You've picked a third-class cricketer
for the team


417
00:27:33.150 --> 00:27:35.430
to bring shame to the nation.

418
00:27:35.670 --> 00:27:37.230
Are you a coach or a cockroach?

419
00:27:37.550 --> 00:27:40.430
You've picked garbage...

420
00:27:40.830 --> 00:27:41.910
hand-picked it.

421
00:27:58.790 --> 00:27:59.830
I just want to...

422
00:28:00.110 --> 00:28:01.470
I just want to kill
that son of a...!


423
00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:03.270
Forget that fool.

424
00:28:04.790 --> 00:28:05.870
Ani, focus on England.

425
00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:07.150
You're leaving day after.

426
00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:10.110
What if he's right?

427
00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:11.310
What!

428
00:28:12.430 --> 00:28:14.990
What if I really am
a third-class batter?


429
00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:16.630
Ani, are you crazy?

430
00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:20.710
You're the next superstar
of women's cricket.


431
00:28:21.030 --> 00:28:22.190
Whose wicket can be taken...

432
00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:26.630
by even a drunk, unfit,
retired male bowler.


433
00:28:27.190 --> 00:28:28.950
Fluke, Ani.
It was a fluke.


434
00:28:29.270 --> 00:28:30.950
If he bowled another ball,

435
00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:32.670
it would be game over for him!

436
00:28:32.910 --> 00:28:35.950
You can play Jimmy Anderson
better than our male players.


437
00:28:36.670 --> 00:28:38.390
So, come on, cheer up.

438
00:28:42.670 --> 00:28:43.910
Cover your ears.

439
00:28:44.550 --> 00:28:46.950
- Why?
- I said, cover your ears.


440
00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:49.110
I am driving... how can I?

441
00:29:14.430 --> 00:29:15.470
Okay, done.

442
00:29:16.190 --> 00:29:16.950
Done?

443
00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:19.070
Don't stop. Call him more names.

444
00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:20.070
Shut up.

445
00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:31.870
You should wear a helmet while playing.

446
00:29:32.430 --> 00:29:33.110
Why?

447
00:29:33.710 --> 00:29:35.670
How will people focus
on your batting?


448
00:29:41.030 --> 00:29:43.910
Who do you think you are,
flirting with an Indian cricketer?


449
00:29:44.270 --> 00:29:45.430
Who should I be?

450
00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:49.350
At least somebody who can afford
to buy a small new car.


451
00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:52.910
I sold my company for 20 million dollars
in the US.


452
00:29:56.550 --> 00:29:57.870
20 million dollars?

453
00:29:58.390 --> 00:30:01.030
Then why the hell are you driving
this piece of junk?


454
00:30:01.350 --> 00:30:02.870
It's the safest car in the world...

455
00:30:03.150 --> 00:30:04.150
doesn't go faster than 30 kmph.

456
00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:08.150
The wiper moves when I want to start
the indicator.


457
00:30:08.390 --> 00:30:10.030
What do I use to start the indicator?

458
00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:11.270
This.

459
00:31:31.150 --> 00:31:32.150
How is Ani?

460
00:31:33.310 --> 00:31:34.870
She has lost a lot of blood.

461
00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:37.470
Her right hand took the whole impact
of the accident.


462
00:31:37.870 --> 00:31:39.910
Bones and tissues
have been severely damaged.


463
00:31:40.030 --> 00:31:41.630
Nerves have been completely destroyed.

464
00:31:43.630 --> 00:31:45.910
- We had to do a closed amputation.
- Amputa--


465
00:31:46.550 --> 00:31:50.270
Sorry, we tried our best but
we could not save her right arm.


466
00:31:50.550 --> 00:31:53.550
Fortunately, there is no head injury
or any other serious injuries.


467
00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:55.030
She'll be fine.

468
00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:09.590
- What!
- 'Yes, ma'am.'


469
00:32:09.870 --> 00:32:10.910
My god.

470
00:32:11.150 --> 00:32:12.350
'How did it happen?'

471
00:32:12.790 --> 00:32:13.630
When did it happen?

472
00:32:14.110 --> 00:32:15.070
Last night.

473
00:32:15.710 --> 00:32:16.670
She's at Maxx Hospital.

474
00:32:55.630 --> 00:32:57.350
How many men did this?

475
00:32:57.790 --> 00:32:58.750
What?

476
00:32:59.270 --> 00:33:00.510
Hurts a lot?

477
00:33:01.950 --> 00:33:02.950
Want to pee?

478
00:33:03.230 --> 00:33:04.430
- No.
- Then why are you getting up?


479
00:33:05.670 --> 00:33:06.990
I'll change the dressing.

480
00:33:13.550 --> 00:33:15.310
What a pretty nose.

481
00:33:16.750 --> 00:33:18.510
Have to ward off the evil eye.

482
00:33:19.870 --> 00:33:23.190
My brothers too spared your whole face
and smashed just your nose.


483
00:33:24.270 --> 00:33:27.710
Keep quiet or else
I'll break your nose too!


484
00:33:28.150 --> 00:33:28.910
What did you say?

485
00:33:29.030 --> 00:33:30.390
You'll hit a woman?

486
00:33:30.670 --> 00:33:32.270
You were better as a man.

487
00:33:32.950 --> 00:33:35.230
You did your work quietly...

488
00:33:36.310 --> 00:33:37.750
now all you do is blabber!

489
00:33:38.030 --> 00:33:39.230
Yeah right!

490
00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:43.350
Dragging home a 90 kg man
from the car, in the middle of the night


491
00:33:44.390 --> 00:33:45.950
applying bandage

492
00:33:47.190 --> 00:33:49.750
changing the pants
of an unconscious body


493
00:33:49.950 --> 00:33:52.870
cleaning vomit off the carpet...
staying up all night


494
00:33:53.390 --> 00:33:54.790
is hardly any work!

495
00:33:55.230 --> 00:33:56.790
Shut up.

496
00:34:07.510 --> 00:34:10.310
I took it out of the washing machine...
just in time.


497
00:34:12.630 --> 00:34:13.790
There'll be 7 missed calls.

498
00:34:13.910 --> 00:34:16.110
How many times have I told you
not to check my phone.


499
00:34:17.190 --> 00:34:18.110
Give my glasses.

500
00:34:18.790 --> 00:34:20.910
Anger will inflame the wound.

501
00:34:24.390 --> 00:34:26.430
I didn't check your phone...
I only called.


502
00:36:10.510 --> 00:36:12.510
It's really very unfortunate...

503
00:36:14.430 --> 00:36:16.350
but now, we have to look
for a replacement.


504
00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:21.310
"These things called dreams"

505
00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:25.470
"They think the world is theirs"

506
00:36:27.190 --> 00:36:31.510
"This thing called hope"

507
00:36:31.830 --> 00:36:36.310
"Is all airy fairy"

508
00:36:40.310 --> 00:36:44.030
"This thing called aspiration"

509
00:36:44.910 --> 00:36:49.270
"Flies without ever taking off"

510
00:36:52.750 --> 00:36:55.870
"All these poetic thoughts"

511
00:36:58.910 --> 00:37:02.150
"will end now that I'm here"

512
00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:05.990
"Surrender to me"

513
00:37:06.750 --> 00:37:08.190
"I'm the punctuation mark"

514
00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:11.230
"Called the full stop"

515
00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:17.590
"To put an abrupt end"

516
00:37:19.950 --> 00:37:22.430
"Is my job"

517
00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:27.310
"This life is my slave"

518
00:37:29.430 --> 00:37:32.230
"I am the full stop"

519
00:37:57.190 --> 00:38:01.710
"All this fake courage"

520
00:38:02.430 --> 00:38:05.750
"Doesn't stand a chance"

521
00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:11.830
"How will the story
of your dreams progress"


522
00:38:12.870 --> 00:38:16.750
"When I'm present on every page"

523
00:38:17.510 --> 00:38:21.590
"I hold the reins of time"

524
00:38:22.710 --> 00:38:26.270
"Obey me, obey me, obey me"

525
00:38:29.630 --> 00:38:32.790
"All these poetic thoughts"

526
00:38:35.870 --> 00:38:39.510
"will end now that I'm here"

527
00:38:40.070 --> 00:38:44.630
"I am just a small dot"

528
00:38:45.310 --> 00:38:48.550
"I am the full stop"

529
00:38:50.510 --> 00:38:55.110
"To put an abrupt end"

530
00:38:56.790 --> 00:38:58.710
"Is my job"

531
00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:03.870
This pain is called phantom pain.

532
00:39:04.110 --> 00:39:07.590
It's felt in that part of the body,
which doesn't exist anymore.


533
00:39:07.870 --> 00:39:09.630
It's a post-amputation phenomenon.

534
00:39:09.830 --> 00:39:12.310
Her brain still thinks
that her right arm exists.


535
00:39:12.590 --> 00:39:14.590
This sensation will slowly go away.

536
00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:19.190
"I am the full stop"

537
00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:46.190
I don't have the strength to hit you.

538
00:39:54.950 --> 00:39:56.670
Feeling guilty?

539
00:39:59.670 --> 00:40:01.230
Survivor's guilt?

540
00:40:07.870 --> 00:40:09.470
I love you, Ani.

541
00:40:09.790 --> 00:40:10.630
Wow!

542
00:40:12.430 --> 00:40:13.750
You're so great, Jeet.

543
00:40:14.230 --> 00:40:15.230
Thank you.

544
00:40:15.470 --> 00:40:16.990
I should touch your feet.

545
00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:19.670
Let me touch your feet, Jeet.
Your feet, Jeet...


546
00:40:19.870 --> 00:40:21.350
Give me your feet.

547
00:40:21.550 --> 00:40:23.790
Give me your feet.
Please, give me your feet!


548
00:40:23.990 --> 00:40:25.670
- Please, please give me your feet!
- Ani, just shut up.


549
00:40:25.790 --> 00:40:26.630
You shut up!

550
00:40:29.630 --> 00:40:32.230
You want to say 'I love you'
to a cripple and become a hero?


551
00:40:33.110 --> 00:40:35.390
Got bored after earning

552
00:40:36.190 --> 00:40:39.110
To have a new goal in life,
you want to take advantage of me?


553
00:40:39.390 --> 00:40:40.550
What do you want?

554
00:40:40.670 --> 00:40:43.790
You want me to applaud you all my life,
with one hand?


555
00:40:45.230 --> 00:40:47.070
You want to feel bigger
than what you are


556
00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:49.430
by making me feel smaller
than what I am?


557
00:40:50.390 --> 00:40:52.270
Take your love and shove it up!

558
00:41:23.350 --> 00:41:24.790
I want to die.

559
00:41:25.470 --> 00:41:26.790
I want to die.

560
00:41:32.350 --> 00:41:35.910
Do I wish you happy birthday
or happy last day?


561
00:41:51.390 --> 00:41:52.390
How will you die?

562
00:41:53.950 --> 00:41:55.550
By tying a rope to the fan?

563
00:41:55.750 --> 00:41:58.150
Or by tying a bed sheet?

564
00:42:00.310 --> 00:42:01.230
Tie...

565
00:42:01.550 --> 00:42:04.190
Oh, but how will
you tie with one hand?

566
00:42:06.870 --> 00:42:07.990
Here you go.

567
00:42:08.670 --> 00:42:11.150
Slash your wrist with this.

568
00:42:12.030 --> 00:42:14.470
But to slash the wrist of one hand
you'll need the other hand.


569
00:42:16.830 --> 00:42:18.110
Rat poison.

570
00:42:19.310 --> 00:42:20.430
Phenyl?

571
00:42:21.590 --> 00:42:23.230
But you might survive.

572
00:42:24.430 --> 00:42:26.950
Hmm... tough tough!

573
00:42:28.390 --> 00:42:30.590
How were you planning to die?

574
00:42:30.870 --> 00:42:32.110
What are you doing here?

575
00:42:34.950 --> 00:42:38.630
I came to wish you...
happy birthday.


576
00:42:46.270 --> 00:42:48.070
You're feeling sorry for me too?

577
00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:50.150
I can't believe this.

578
00:42:50.830 --> 00:42:54.590
A crass drunkard who ridiculed me
till yesterday...


579
00:42:56.470 --> 00:43:00.510
has given up his Happy Hour
to come wish me happy birthday!


580
00:43:00.630 --> 00:43:01.190
Great!

581
00:43:01.310 --> 00:43:03.430
Ani... all okay?

582
00:43:03.670 --> 00:43:05.270
Dad, have you met this man?

583
00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:07.270
Yes... while you were with Jeet,

584
00:43:07.390 --> 00:43:08.510
we were chatting outside.

585
00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:10.750
Mr Padam Singh Sodhi
was all praise for you.


586
00:43:11.190 --> 00:43:13.230
And who will know better
than the Chairman of Selectors?


587
00:43:15.190 --> 00:43:16.510
One more cup of coffee?

588
00:43:17.750 --> 00:43:19.030
Yeah, sure.

589
00:43:19.990 --> 00:43:21.550
- Let's make it Irish.
- Sure.


590
00:43:21.670 --> 00:43:24.590
- And another slice of the cake.
- Right away.


591
00:43:26.230 --> 00:43:27.470
Chairman of Selectors?

592
00:43:27.750 --> 00:43:28.910
Yeah, it worked, didn't it?

593
00:43:29.030 --> 00:43:30.150
What are you doing here?

594
00:43:32.990 --> 00:43:33.910
You know...

595
00:43:35.990 --> 00:43:39.430
when I was dropped from the team...

596
00:43:41.230 --> 00:43:44.390
no one came to
meet me to say -

597
00:43:44.990 --> 00:43:48.030
'Don't worry, Paddy.
You'll play the next series.'


598
00:43:49.470 --> 00:43:52.030
So I have come here to tell you...

599
00:43:53.750 --> 00:43:55.310
Don't worry, Anina.

600
00:43:56.430 --> 00:43:59.270
You'll definitely play the next series.

601
00:44:01.870 --> 00:44:03.870
Have you quit whiskey
and moved on to cocaine?


602
00:44:03.990 --> 00:44:06.830
- Cake. Your coffee is just coming.
- Dad, ask this man to get out of here.


603
00:44:06.950 --> 00:44:08.870
- What happened?
- Get him out of here, Dad!


604
00:44:08.990 --> 00:44:11.790
- What happened?
- Nothing, sir. I just told her,


605
00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:13.910
'You'll definitely play
the next series.'


606
00:44:14.910 --> 00:44:16.230
And... she is saying, 'Get out!'

607
00:44:16.430 --> 00:44:18.550
Don't know what I did wrong --

608
00:44:18.670 --> 00:44:20.950
Don't know, is it?
You don't know?


609
00:44:21.350 --> 00:44:22.990
You are the one
who cut off my hand.

610
00:44:23.230 --> 00:44:25.510
If you hadn't insulted me
in front of my team,


611
00:44:25.630 --> 00:44:27.030
I wouldn't have got into that car!

612
00:44:27.150 --> 00:44:28.230
The car wouldn't have crashed and...

613
00:44:28.350 --> 00:44:30.590
I wouldn't be this
breathing corpse today!


614
00:44:32.630 --> 00:44:35.270
What breathing? What corpse?
You're fine.


615
00:44:35.990 --> 00:44:37.910
You'll definitely play the next series.

616
00:44:39.310 --> 00:44:40.270
I'm fine?

617
00:44:40.670 --> 00:44:41.710
I'm fine, is it?

618
00:44:43.030 --> 00:44:44.270
This is fine?

619
00:44:46.150 --> 00:44:48.390
Where's my bat, Dad?
Get my bat!


620
00:44:48.630 --> 00:44:50.430
Like this... will I play like this?

621
00:44:53.590 --> 00:44:56.230
Cricket is not just about batting.

622
00:44:59.150 --> 00:45:01.150
Happy birthday, Anina.

623
00:45:04.750 --> 00:45:06.870
A N I N A

624
00:45:08.150 --> 00:45:10.870
Whether you go right to left,
or left to right...


625
00:45:10.990 --> 00:45:12.550
Anina is Anina.

626
00:45:17.070 --> 00:45:18.670
Anina from the Pavilion End...

627
00:45:19.030 --> 00:45:20.590
left-arm over the wicket...

628
00:45:21.550 --> 00:45:23.990
Camilla is beaten and bowled.

629
00:45:26.070 --> 00:45:29.270
England will tour India
in 10 months.


630
00:45:30.710 --> 00:45:33.270
It's difficult to kill yourself
with one hand.


631
00:45:34.350 --> 00:45:36.470
But playing for India again,
if you wish to,


632
00:45:38.950 --> 00:45:40.670
is an easier option... left.

633
00:46:51.030 --> 00:46:51.950
May I play?

634
00:46:52.070 --> 00:46:52.830
Sure.

635
00:46:53.670 --> 00:46:54.510
Bowling.

636
00:46:54.790 --> 00:46:55.910
Give her the ball.

637
00:46:57.550 --> 00:46:58.670
Come on...

638
00:47:14.310 --> 00:47:15.390
No problem.

639
00:47:15.630 --> 00:47:16.830
Get the ball.

640
00:47:32.270 --> 00:47:33.670
Good bowling!

641
00:47:37.110 --> 00:47:38.070
Catch it.

642
00:47:38.710 --> 00:47:39.550
Out!

643
00:48:06.750 --> 00:48:10.190
January 1995,
India vs. South Africa.


644
00:48:11.150 --> 00:48:13.710
South Africa 76 for no loss

645
00:48:14.350 --> 00:48:17.030
Padam Singh Sodhi's first test match.

646
00:48:17.150 --> 00:48:19.750
In the second ball of his first over
he gets a wicket.


647
00:48:19.990 --> 00:48:23.590
Next ball, the batsman collides
with him while taking a run...


648
00:48:23.710 --> 00:48:25.910
and he fractures a rib.

649
00:48:26.550 --> 00:48:28.870
He doesn't play the rest of the match.

650
00:48:29.030 --> 00:48:33.710
Then, despite taking 42 wickets
in the domestic season,


651
00:48:34.230 --> 00:48:36.790
he's never selected
to play for India again.


652
00:48:39.670 --> 00:48:43.030
The forgotten man now lives
at this address.


653
00:49:04.350 --> 00:49:05.350
What!

654
00:49:05.750 --> 00:49:06.950
Dad, are you listening?

655
00:49:07.710 --> 00:49:09.270
A random man comes
and says ridiculous things...


656
00:49:09.390 --> 00:49:10.790
and we take it seriously?

657
00:49:12.710 --> 00:49:14.790
Ani, listen to me.

658
00:49:15.590 --> 00:49:17.070
We will go to New York.

659
00:49:17.390 --> 00:49:18.670
I've done full research...

660
00:49:19.430 --> 00:49:22.510
biomechanics and robotic technology
are very advanced now.


661
00:49:22.750 --> 00:49:25.910
A prosthetic arm can be just
like a real hand.


662
00:49:26.150 --> 00:49:27.630
You'll be able to do everything.

663
00:49:27.790 --> 00:49:28.950
Who knows...

664
00:49:29.950 --> 00:49:31.510
you might be able to bat one day!

665
00:49:31.870 --> 00:49:33.350
We have also done our research...

666
00:49:34.310 --> 00:49:36.590
she won't be allowed to play
with this bio-robot.


667
00:49:37.070 --> 00:49:39.550
The rules don't allow it.

668
00:49:39.950 --> 00:49:41.310
I want to play for India.

669
00:49:41.590 --> 00:49:42.310
India?

670
00:49:42.990 --> 00:49:44.030
Papa, will you say something?

671
00:49:44.510 --> 00:49:49.110
With one eye, if Tiger Pataudi,
could captain the Indian team...


672
00:49:49.630 --> 00:49:52.910
with one hand, why can't she
play for India?


673
00:51:20.590 --> 00:51:21.790
Who is it?

674
00:51:22.750 --> 00:51:23.750
Anina.

675
00:51:25.270 --> 00:51:26.350
Come in.

676
00:51:27.830 --> 00:51:30.070
I can come in only
if you open the door.

677
00:51:30.270 --> 00:51:32.230
The lock is jammed
from inside...


678
00:51:32.670 --> 00:51:33.950
You'll have to open it
from outside.


679
00:51:34.430 --> 00:51:37.110
- How?
- On your right-hand side--


680
00:51:40.070 --> 00:51:42.070
You were saying,
on my right-hand side...


681
00:51:42.190 --> 00:51:44.910
There is a big flowerpot.
The key is under it.


682
00:51:58.070 --> 00:51:59.150
It's very heavy.

683
00:51:59.350 --> 00:52:01.470
Exactly why the key is safe
under it.


684
00:52:11.950 --> 00:52:13.150
What happened?

685
00:52:13.390 --> 00:52:14.750
Can't do it?

686
00:52:22.710 --> 00:52:24.470
You can't do it.

687
00:52:25.310 --> 00:52:26.550
Go home.

688
00:52:38.470 --> 00:52:41.110
When life shuts the door on your face

689
00:52:42.390 --> 00:52:43.750
you can't open it,

690
00:52:46.150 --> 00:52:47.430
you have to break it open!

691
00:52:50.710 --> 00:52:51.830
Lesson number one.

692
00:52:54.190 --> 00:52:56.550
- What happened?
- House warming!


693
00:52:57.030 --> 00:52:58.230
Who is this?

694
00:52:59.430 --> 00:53:00.230
Hi.

695
00:53:02.030 --> 00:53:03.990
- Anina.
- Rasika.


696
00:53:06.350 --> 00:53:07.550
She's left handed!

697
00:53:07.710 --> 00:53:09.270
It's her only hand left.

698
00:53:19.630 --> 00:53:20.590
Bowl.

699
00:53:24.030 --> 00:53:24.910
Here?

700
00:53:25.230 --> 00:53:26.150
Yeah.

701
00:53:26.510 --> 00:53:27.950
But this is a jungle.

702
00:53:28.550 --> 00:53:30.870
What do you want? MCG?

703
00:53:32.110 --> 00:53:34.470
Make your Melbourne Cricket Ground here.

704
00:53:36.830 --> 00:53:38.030
What happened?

705
00:53:40.630 --> 00:53:41.790
I see...

706
00:53:42.430 --> 00:53:45.350
Not enough space for a stadium?

707
00:53:47.070 --> 00:53:49.350
Forget the stadium,
nobody is going to watch anyway.


708
00:53:49.510 --> 00:53:52.310
Just make the ground. Enough.

709
00:53:54.830 --> 00:53:55.830
Actually...

710
00:53:56.990 --> 00:53:57.990
who needs a ground?

711
00:53:58.110 --> 00:53:59.390
No one's going to hit a boundary!

712
00:53:59.550 --> 00:54:01.550
All a bowler needs is...

713
00:54:04.270 --> 00:54:06.470
...five, six, seven...

714
00:54:11.230 --> 00:54:12.910
...just 22 yards...

715
00:54:14.990 --> 00:54:17.230
and a little more.

716
00:54:19.070 --> 00:54:20.870
Just make a pitch and bowl.

717
00:54:23.270 --> 00:54:24.830
I have to make... a pitch?

718
00:54:25.590 --> 00:54:28.070
You'll be the one bowling, right?

719
00:54:29.910 --> 00:54:32.750
Don't worry, you'll get help.

720
00:54:45.910 --> 00:54:47.710
- Why trouble the poor thing...
- Buzz off.


721
00:54:51.110 --> 00:54:51.950
Go on, open it.

722
00:55:01.390 --> 00:55:02.710
Is this a joke?

723
00:55:03.630 --> 00:55:06.190
I want to be a bowler,
not a gardener.


724
00:55:13.110 --> 00:55:17.430
Your left hand that's been cleaning
just one thing all its life...


725
00:55:18.710 --> 00:55:21.510
can't suddenly wake up one day
and bowl!


726
00:55:28.150 --> 00:55:30.830
Your left hand has to earn
the right to bowl.


727
00:55:50.230 --> 00:55:52.350
"When all it takes is one eye"

728
00:55:52.670 --> 00:55:55.990
"To see a dream"

729
00:55:57.430 --> 00:55:59.710
"Does it matter if you don't have two?"

730
00:55:59.910 --> 00:56:01.870
"When all it takes is one paddle"

731
00:56:02.310 --> 00:56:05.590
"To steer a boat across the river"

732
00:56:07.150 --> 00:56:09.470
"Does it matter if you don't have two?"

733
00:56:09.590 --> 00:56:10.750
"So what if you don't have it"

734
00:56:10.870 --> 00:56:11.870
"So what if you have a little less"

735
00:56:11.990 --> 00:56:13.870
"So what if your heart
is a little heavy"


736
00:56:14.430 --> 00:56:15.550
"Do what you must"

737
00:56:15.670 --> 00:56:17.990
"Your power comes from having less"

738
00:56:21.750 --> 00:56:23.590
"Forget the complaints"

739
00:56:24.030 --> 00:56:25.710
"Soar like an eagle"

740
00:56:26.430 --> 00:56:28.470
"Flapping one wing"

741
00:56:28.710 --> 00:56:30.790
"Rise above your destiny"

742
00:56:31.430 --> 00:56:32.910
"Forget the complaints"

743
00:56:33.830 --> 00:56:35.390
"Soar like an eagle"

744
00:56:36.270 --> 00:56:38.030
"Flapping one wing"

745
00:56:38.430 --> 00:56:39.870
"Rise above your destiny"

746
00:57:12.270 --> 00:57:13.350
I'm hungry.

747
00:57:14.950 --> 00:57:15.790
Me too.

748
00:57:17.350 --> 00:57:20.390
Flour, potatoes, onions
and chillies.


749
00:57:20.670 --> 00:57:21.950
Can we order something?

750
00:57:22.190 --> 00:57:23.350
Sure, order...

751
00:57:24.230 --> 00:57:25.270
one right hand.

752
00:57:55.590 --> 00:57:57.470
You made a map of England...

753
00:57:57.710 --> 00:57:58.710
Gobble up England.

754
00:57:58.830 --> 00:57:59.910
Won't you eat?

755
00:58:00.430 --> 00:58:01.270
Thank you.

756
00:58:03.550 --> 00:58:04.390
Leg piece.

757
00:58:05.190 --> 00:58:06.150
I ordered it.

758
00:58:08.750 --> 00:58:11.710
"There's one sun, one moon"

759
00:58:12.070 --> 00:58:14.310
"One earth, one sky"

760
00:58:14.470 --> 00:58:17.470
"See yourself...
you're one of a kind too"


761
00:58:19.350 --> 00:58:21.350
"Look around you"

762
00:58:21.750 --> 00:58:23.990
"Everyone wants to be one in a million"

763
00:58:24.150 --> 00:58:27.350
"Luckily, you're already
one in a million"


764
00:58:28.190 --> 00:58:29.830
"You are the one"

765
00:58:34.430 --> 00:58:35.990
Bad light stops play.

766
00:59:18.710 --> 00:59:19.990
What are you doing here?

767
00:59:20.630 --> 00:59:22.350
You asked me to get out,
so I'm standing outside.


768
00:59:23.110 --> 00:59:25.230
Why weren't you waiting outside
all these days?


769
00:59:37.590 --> 00:59:39.750
You'll get tired if you follow me.

770
00:59:40.070 --> 00:59:42.270
If I do, I'll catch my breath
and catch up.


771
00:59:44.550 --> 00:59:46.190
My path is different.

772
01:00:05.590 --> 01:00:06.910
No no no, not that one!

773
01:00:07.630 --> 01:00:09.390
- That's Dhoni.
- Dhoni?


774
01:00:09.590 --> 01:00:11.990
Wicket keeper... to stop the ball.

775
01:00:12.270 --> 01:00:13.910
But he'll put up nets for that.

776
01:00:14.310 --> 01:00:16.310
If he hears you,
he'll make me put them up.


777
01:00:16.430 --> 01:00:17.590
Rasika!

778
01:00:18.230 --> 01:00:20.390
She didn't call me.
I'm the one who came to help.


779
01:00:20.950 --> 01:00:21.630
Help?

780
01:00:22.870 --> 01:00:23.750
Hold her hand.

781
01:00:33.150 --> 01:00:35.030
Now help her bowl.

782
01:00:36.790 --> 01:00:37.630
Bowl.

783
01:00:38.830 --> 01:00:39.750
Bowl!

784
01:00:43.710 --> 01:00:45.790
Cricket is not a team sport...

785
01:00:47.070 --> 01:00:48.470
until you're in the team.

786
01:00:51.390 --> 01:00:52.710
Get lost!

787
01:00:53.630 --> 01:00:54.830
Crib, crib, crib, crib.

788
01:00:54.950 --> 01:00:56.350
Couldn't find anyone to marry...

789
01:00:56.510 --> 01:00:57.950
takes out his prustration on me.

790
01:01:47.030 --> 01:01:49.270
"There's one sun, one moon"

791
01:01:49.550 --> 01:01:51.670
"One earth, one sky"

792
01:01:51.950 --> 01:01:54.910
"See yourself...
you're one of a kind too"


793
01:01:56.830 --> 01:01:58.910
"Look around you"

794
01:01:59.230 --> 01:02:01.430
"Everyone wants to be one in a million"

795
01:02:01.630 --> 01:02:04.830
"Luckily, you're already
one in a million"


796
01:02:05.430 --> 01:02:07.470
"You are the one"

797
01:02:29.430 --> 01:02:31.070
Water has stopped.

798
01:02:35.270 --> 01:02:37.270
"Forget the complaints"

799
01:02:37.590 --> 01:02:39.630
"Soar like an eagle"

800
01:02:40.030 --> 01:02:42.030
"Flapping one wing"

801
01:02:42.150 --> 01:02:44.310
"Rise above your destiny"

802
01:03:45.190 --> 01:03:48.670
Booster is the secret of your energy.

803
01:04:52.910 --> 01:04:53.910
Whoa!

804
01:04:54.670 --> 01:04:56.110
What have you done!

805
01:04:56.790 --> 01:04:57.630
Give me your hand.

806
01:04:57.870 --> 01:04:59.510
No no, what if he sees me
lending a hand?


807
01:04:59.710 --> 01:05:00.790
Just give your hand.

808
01:05:02.430 --> 01:05:04.830
- Aah... is that a hand or a hammer!
- See.


809
01:05:08.990 --> 01:05:11.430
All this gardening
has turned you into Muhammad Ali!


810
01:05:11.550 --> 01:05:12.910
Now I feel like a bowler.

811
01:05:13.030 --> 01:05:14.790
It's a beautiful day at the MCG.

812
01:05:14.910 --> 01:05:16.430
Play is all set to begin.

813
01:05:18.830 --> 01:05:21.310
There is an unwanted spectator
on the field.


814
01:05:23.550 --> 01:05:24.990
Anina from the Pavilion End.

815
01:05:30.190 --> 01:05:32.270
Left-arm... over the wicket.

816
01:05:44.870 --> 01:05:45.630
Short and wide.

817
01:05:45.750 --> 01:05:47.990
The batsman smashes the ball
in his sleep...


818
01:05:48.110 --> 01:05:49.550
for 4 runs.

819
01:05:53.550 --> 01:05:56.070
A rubbish half volley... 6 runs.

820
01:05:59.190 --> 01:06:01.870
2 kms away from the leg stump...

821
01:06:08.750 --> 01:06:10.310
A rubbish full toss.

822
01:06:10.710 --> 01:06:13.430
The ball flies out of the stadium...

823
01:06:15.550 --> 01:06:18.310
If muscles were all a bowler needed,

824
01:06:19.030 --> 01:06:22.030
Muhammad Ali would've been
the world's best bowler.


825
01:06:27.030 --> 01:06:28.670
'I'm a bowler.'

826
01:06:29.710 --> 01:06:31.470
Before you utter these three words...

827
01:06:31.590 --> 01:06:35.630
bowl at least three thousand times!

828
01:06:39.670 --> 01:06:40.390
Bowl!

829
01:06:43.350 --> 01:06:44.310
Pitch it here.

830
01:06:48.950 --> 01:06:49.750
Here.

831
01:06:58.110 --> 01:06:59.150
Get up.

832
01:07:15.230 --> 01:07:16.830
Just look at Bishan Singh Bedi.

833
01:07:17.150 --> 01:07:20.350
Even if I practice for 10 years,
I won't be able to bowl like this.


834
01:07:21.390 --> 01:07:23.150
Congratulations, you're pregnant.

835
01:07:24.310 --> 01:07:26.950
You're comparing yourself
with Bishan Singh Bedi.


836
01:07:27.190 --> 01:07:29.910
Means, there's a bowler
growing inside you.


837
01:07:30.390 --> 01:07:32.790
Waiting to be born.

838
01:07:35.150 --> 01:07:35.830
Hi.

839
01:07:35.950 --> 01:07:37.030
Rasika!

840
01:07:39.990 --> 01:07:42.990
I've told you so many times
to get that fence fixed!


841
01:07:43.190 --> 01:07:44.430
Bloody buffaloes!

842
01:07:44.550 --> 01:07:46.030
See the mess they've made.

843
01:07:47.190 --> 01:07:48.390
What a mess!

844
01:07:48.630 --> 01:07:49.750
Shit!

845
01:07:49.990 --> 01:07:51.430
It's about to rain.

846
01:07:51.950 --> 01:07:52.750
Bowl.

847
01:07:52.870 --> 01:07:53.750
- How?
- Bowl.


848
01:07:53.870 --> 01:07:55.590
- I'll clean this in two minutes.
- We don't have two minutes.


849
01:07:55.710 --> 01:07:56.630
Bowl, come on... 
Bowl bowl bowl!

850
01:07:56.750 --> 01:07:58.030
- The ball will land on the dung.
- Shut up!


851
01:07:59.590 --> 01:08:00.870
Left-arm around the wicket.

852
01:08:01.150 --> 01:08:01.990
Hurry up!

853
01:08:08.670 --> 01:08:10.670
A good length delivery...
on the off stump.


854
01:08:10.830 --> 01:08:12.230
The batsman had to defend.

855
01:08:18.630 --> 01:08:19.830
Correct line... on the middle stump.

856
01:08:19.950 --> 01:08:21.750
The batsman defends again.

857
01:08:25.590 --> 01:08:27.110
Full length... a beautiful delivery

858
01:08:27.310 --> 01:08:29.030
No big shot played.

859
01:08:29.150 --> 01:08:31.110
One perfect ball after another.

860
01:08:31.230 --> 01:08:32.670
I had my heart in my mouth.

861
01:08:33.150 --> 01:08:34.470
What if the ball lands on the dung!

862
01:08:35.790 --> 01:08:36.990
He's a genius.

863
01:08:37.190 --> 01:08:39.270
You're the one who bowled,
how is he the genius?


864
01:08:39.430 --> 01:08:40.990
This is short pitched...

865
01:08:43.950 --> 01:08:45.070
This is over pitched...

866
01:08:45.190 --> 01:08:46.390
This is outside the off stump...

867
01:08:46.510 --> 01:08:47.470
And this is outside leg stump.

868
01:08:47.590 --> 01:08:50.310
If the ball lands
here... here... here...


869
01:08:50.430 --> 01:08:51.830
it's a shit ball.

870
01:08:52.350 --> 01:08:55.790
I've been avoiding the dung and
aiming at the gaps while bowling.


871
01:08:55.910 --> 01:08:57.230
The line and length became perfect.

872
01:08:57.350 --> 01:08:58.030
Shit!

873
01:08:58.150 --> 01:09:00.550
Shit is a good fertilizer for growth!

874
01:09:02.110 --> 01:09:05.430
Till you can bowl perfectly
with your eyes closed...


875
01:09:06.070 --> 01:09:06.710
Bowl!

876
01:09:16.630 --> 01:09:20.030
Why is it so important for you
to make her a cricketer?


877
01:09:22.230 --> 01:09:24.950
When something is snatched away
from someone without reason...


878
01:09:25.830 --> 01:09:26.990
it's wrong.

879
01:09:34.670 --> 01:09:39.510
Looks like God has sent you here
to rectify His mistakes.


880
01:09:43.430 --> 01:09:44.670
Give me some more nectar.

881
01:09:44.790 --> 01:09:46.470
- No more.
- What!


882
01:09:46.830 --> 01:09:49.030
From now on, I'll be the one
rectifying mistakes.


883
01:09:49.390 --> 01:09:50.390
It's a Dry Day, from today.

884
01:09:50.550 --> 01:09:52.550
Damn woman!
Who are you to shut my bar?


885
01:09:52.990 --> 01:09:56.870
I am that woman, who would've died a man
if not for you.


886
01:09:58.350 --> 01:09:59.990
You understood my reality,

887
01:10:00.230 --> 01:10:01.910
fought with my family,

888
01:10:02.230 --> 01:10:03.310
helped me get operated,

889
01:10:03.430 --> 01:10:05.310
gave me a new identity,

890
01:10:05.430 --> 01:10:06.590
adopted me as your sister...

891
01:10:06.710 --> 01:10:08.390
Your liver... I will not let it die!

892
01:10:12.110 --> 01:10:13.150
Liver?

893
01:10:14.550 --> 01:10:15.790
If I don't drink one day,

894
01:10:15.910 --> 01:10:18.750
my liver will message
the other workers of my body...


895
01:10:19.230 --> 01:10:22.190
'Boss is dead. 
Stop work now!'

896
01:10:22.310 --> 01:10:23.790
Shutter down.

897
01:10:24.270 --> 01:10:25.630
I'll truly die.

898
01:10:30.350 --> 01:10:32.750
Then who will rectify
your God's mistakes?


899
01:10:43.750 --> 01:10:45.630
I don't understand...

900
01:10:49.550 --> 01:10:52.310
how did the buffaloes shit
in the perfect spots?


901
01:11:30.030 --> 01:11:31.030
Happy Diwali!

902
01:12:07.910 --> 01:12:08.870
Happy Diwali!

903
01:12:09.070 --> 01:12:10.270
Happy Diwali!

904
01:12:14.750 --> 01:12:15.990
Happy Diwali, sir.

905
01:12:20.190 --> 01:12:22.150
Sir... this is Jeet.

906
01:12:22.990 --> 01:12:24.390
Jeet, Paddy sir.

907
01:12:24.670 --> 01:12:26.750
- Hello, sir. Happy Diwali.
- I'm not happy!


908
01:12:29.510 --> 01:12:31.910
You have to be happy today, sir.

909
01:12:32.190 --> 01:12:35.150
You're not allowed to sit alone
in the dark.


910
01:12:40.070 --> 01:12:41.070
Bowl.

911
01:12:45.270 --> 01:12:46.430
How, sir?

912
01:12:49.830 --> 01:12:50.510
Bowl!

913
01:13:35.310 --> 01:13:37.390
Now please be a little happy, sir.

914
01:13:41.710 --> 01:13:42.430
Would you have...

915
01:13:45.670 --> 01:13:47.710
got out to your own bowling?

916
01:13:48.510 --> 01:13:51.150
Once upon a time,
you used to bat, right?


917
01:13:51.390 --> 01:13:53.630
Could you take your own wicket?

918
01:13:54.710 --> 01:13:55.670
Forget that...

919
01:13:55.790 --> 01:13:59.390
could you at least beat your bat
with this bowling?


920
01:14:02.070 --> 01:14:03.070
No?

921
01:14:05.070 --> 01:14:08.150
So then... what do I have
to be so happy for?


922
01:14:11.230 --> 01:14:12.630
More importantly...

923
01:14:14.590 --> 01:14:16.510
what are you so happy for?

924
01:14:18.470 --> 01:14:21.790
Pitching a ball on the right spot
doesn't make anyone a bowler.


925
01:14:22.870 --> 01:14:23.790
Wickets.

926
01:14:24.110 --> 01:14:25.870
A bowler's job is to take wickets.

927
01:14:26.110 --> 01:14:30.270
And you're not capable of taking
even a tail-ender's wicket.


928
01:14:32.190 --> 01:14:35.270
I've been staying up nights thinking...

929
01:14:35.590 --> 01:14:37.830
how will this girl take wickets?

930
01:14:37.990 --> 01:14:39.710
What does a spinner have except

931
01:14:39.830 --> 01:14:41.870
the art of deceiving the batsman

932
01:14:42.150 --> 01:14:43.910
and the magic of playing
with the batsman's mind.


933
01:14:44.070 --> 01:14:45.750
But how will the spinner
weave her magic


934
01:14:45.870 --> 01:14:48.030
if she isn't able to spin the ball?

935
01:14:48.470 --> 01:14:50.830
My head is spinning,
thinking about this.


936
01:14:51.190 --> 01:14:52.150
And you!

937
01:14:52.430 --> 01:14:54.310
You're going around with your lover,

938
01:14:54.550 --> 01:14:57.510
bursting crackers and giving out sweets!

939
01:14:57.950 --> 01:15:00.630
- Sir.
- I'm talking to my player.


940
01:15:05.350 --> 01:15:06.310
Hunger.

941
01:15:06.510 --> 01:15:11.350
The hunger to play for India
is your biggest strength.


942
01:15:11.630 --> 01:15:15.270
If you keep satiating this hunger
with sweet nothings,


943
01:15:15.470 --> 01:15:16.630
you'll be finished!

944
01:15:16.910 --> 01:15:18.790
And you'll have to wait
for Diwali every year


945
01:15:18.910 --> 01:15:19.990
to be happy!

946
01:15:25.710 --> 01:15:26.990
7 a.m. tomorrow.

947
01:15:28.030 --> 01:15:30.070
Stuff cotton in your ears
and go to bed.


948
01:15:30.350 --> 01:15:31.270
Alone!

949
01:15:43.910 --> 01:15:45.150
Leave her hand.

950
01:15:47.310 --> 01:15:48.270
It's fine, it's okay.

951
01:15:49.990 --> 01:15:50.990
Leave her hand.

952
01:15:53.430 --> 01:15:54.590
- I said, leave her hand!
- Sir!


953
01:15:57.510 --> 01:15:58.350
You okay?

954
01:15:59.910 --> 01:16:00.510
Sir...

955
01:16:08.190 --> 01:16:09.190
No!

956
01:16:10.830 --> 01:16:11.950
Let go of her hand
or I'll set you on fire.


957
01:16:12.070 --> 01:16:13.390
- Stop it, sir.
- Leave her hand!


958
01:16:13.510 --> 01:16:14.830
Sir... what are you doing?

959
01:16:17.150 --> 01:16:19.670
It's Diwali... Hold her hand. Boom!

960
01:16:19.790 --> 01:16:20.390
Hold.

961
01:16:20.510 --> 01:16:21.670
- Sir, stop it.
- Dare hold her hand?


962
01:16:21.790 --> 01:16:22.510
Boom!

963
01:16:22.630 --> 01:16:23.950
Diwali! Diwali! Diwali! 
Hold her hand.

964
01:16:24.070 --> 01:16:24.910
Stop it, sir.

965
01:16:25.030 --> 01:16:26.350
Hold, hold. Boom! Boom!

966
01:16:42.390 --> 01:16:45.310
"The lamp burns my soul."

967
01:16:48.870 --> 01:16:50.110
Wickets.

968
01:16:50.910 --> 01:16:52.070
Wickets.

969
01:16:52.630 --> 01:16:53.590
He's a psychopath.

970
01:16:54.790 --> 01:16:56.070
You should've seen him, Granny.

971
01:16:56.190 --> 01:16:58.510
He looked possessed.

972
01:16:59.630 --> 01:17:00.910
Crazy man.

973
01:17:02.030 --> 01:17:03.510
What does he think of himself?

974
01:17:03.790 --> 01:17:05.390
Thinks he's her father?

975
01:17:05.950 --> 01:17:06.950
Bloody fellow!

976
01:17:07.470 --> 01:17:08.590
He came here on his own.

977
01:17:08.750 --> 01:17:11.830
We didn't go begging for his help.

978
01:17:13.150 --> 01:17:14.750
Does he think he owns her?

979
01:17:15.110 --> 01:17:16.310
Torturing her like this!

980
01:17:16.430 --> 01:17:17.430
Exactly.

981
01:17:17.550 --> 01:17:18.630
Exactly.

982
01:17:19.950 --> 01:17:21.030
He does not own her,

983
01:17:21.390 --> 01:17:23.830
he's not her father, brother,
or boyfriend.


984
01:17:24.830 --> 01:17:26.830
He came here uninvited

985
01:17:27.350 --> 01:17:29.990
and took on the responsibility
of her future.


986
01:17:32.870 --> 01:17:35.630
Do you know how much
the monthly electricity bill is?


987
01:17:35.950 --> 01:17:38.110
No one gives electricity, for free.

988
01:17:38.310 --> 01:17:39.470
And this psychopath...

989
01:17:39.590 --> 01:17:42.950
wants to light up the entire life
of a complete stranger, for free!


990
01:17:44.750 --> 01:17:45.950
Crazy man.

991
01:17:55.990 --> 01:17:58.270
I know a coach has to be tough.

992
01:17:58.830 --> 01:18:00.310
But so ruthless.

993
01:18:00.590 --> 01:18:01.750
She's a young girl.

994
01:18:01.870 --> 01:18:03.390
She has lost her arm,
not her heart.


995
01:18:03.510 --> 01:18:05.070
What if something had happened
to the boy?


996
01:18:05.190 --> 01:18:07.830
Why take out your prustration on her?

997
01:18:14.030 --> 01:18:16.270
Yes, I am prustrated.

998
01:18:20.870 --> 01:18:22.870
Pucking prustrated!

999
01:18:24.830 --> 01:18:27.070
My mother died giving birth to me...

1000
01:18:27.430 --> 01:18:29.230
I was born prustrated.

1001
01:18:29.950 --> 01:18:32.110
My father brought home a new wife...

1002
01:18:32.390 --> 01:18:34.350
childhood prustrated.

1003
01:18:35.710 --> 01:18:39.630
Then Cricket took pity on me
and adopted me...


1004
01:18:42.830 --> 01:18:44.990
and my dream came true.

1005
01:18:45.190 --> 01:18:49.190
The dream of playing for India one day.

1006
01:18:50.750 --> 01:18:54.430
One day is all I played for India.

1007
01:18:59.630 --> 01:19:02.430
My entire youth prustrated.

1008
01:19:08.710 --> 01:19:13.230
Logically, I should have got
another chance to play for India


1009
01:19:13.350 --> 01:19:15.030
but this life...

1010
01:19:15.790 --> 01:19:18.150
isn't a game of logic.

1011
01:19:19.310 --> 01:19:20.430
This life...

1012
01:19:21.870 --> 01:19:23.830
is a game of magic.

1013
01:19:24.750 --> 01:19:25.950
Magic.

1014
01:19:28.550 --> 01:19:32.310
But this magic never came
into my life.


1015
01:19:34.310 --> 01:19:36.110
'The system is corrupt.'

1016
01:19:36.550 --> 01:19:38.430
'Politics in the team.'

1017
01:19:38.830 --> 01:19:40.310
'Selectors are puckall.'

1018
01:19:40.430 --> 01:19:45.990
Hearing my constant cribbing,
Magic got prustrated and ran away!


1019
01:19:50.350 --> 01:19:53.310
My hair turned grey.
I stopped talking.


1020
01:19:55.310 --> 01:19:56.750
I stopped living.

1021
01:20:00.510 --> 01:20:04.670
Then, one day suddenly,
there was a knock at my door.


1022
01:20:05.310 --> 01:20:07.590
Opened... saw... it was MAGIC!!!

1023
01:20:08.590 --> 01:20:11.510
'Hello, Paddy. How are you?'

1024
01:20:12.510 --> 01:20:16.550
'Sorry, I couldn't bring magic
to your life.'


1025
01:20:17.990 --> 01:20:21.110
'Try again?
Want another chance?'


1026
01:20:21.430 --> 01:20:23.270
'Here... take Anina. Try.'

1027
01:20:26.070 --> 01:20:29.030
Anina has plenty of talent...

1028
01:20:30.350 --> 01:20:33.630
courage, passion, guts.

1029
01:20:34.110 --> 01:20:35.750
But logically...

1030
01:20:38.030 --> 01:20:40.430
can someone with just one hand
play for the country?


1031
01:20:41.430 --> 01:20:42.190
No.

1032
01:20:43.750 --> 01:20:45.630
You need magic.

1033
01:20:48.510 --> 01:20:51.430
But this damn magic appears

1034
01:20:52.070 --> 01:20:55.430
only when you're 100% ready for it.

1035
01:20:58.830 --> 01:21:01.630
You have to earn the magic!

1036
01:21:02.510 --> 01:21:03.270
Otherwise...

1037
01:21:05.070 --> 01:21:06.910
it's the end of play.

1038
01:21:16.870 --> 01:21:18.550
For a spectator,

1039
01:21:19.470 --> 01:21:21.470
sport is just a game.

1040
01:21:22.710 --> 01:21:24.670
But for players,

1041
01:21:24.790 --> 01:21:29.550
sport is sacrifice.

1042
01:21:33.310 --> 01:21:36.070
What a loser feels...

1043
01:21:37.030 --> 01:21:38.310
I know.

1044
01:21:42.270 --> 01:21:43.990
I know.

1045
01:21:47.390 --> 01:21:49.510
I want her to know...

1046
01:21:50.510 --> 01:21:53.830
how winners feel.

1047
01:22:01.310 --> 01:22:03.510
I also want to know...

1048
01:22:06.310 --> 01:22:08.310
what winners feel.

1049
01:22:19.830 --> 01:22:21.150
Just one day...

1050
01:22:24.830 --> 01:22:27.110
just for one day,
I want to live...


1051
01:22:30.510 --> 01:22:32.070
without prustration.

1052
01:22:36.550 --> 01:22:37.630
For one day.

1053
01:22:43.230 --> 01:22:44.550
Sacrifice.

1054
01:24:50.790 --> 01:24:52.470
Okay now you can spin the ball

1055
01:24:53.150 --> 01:24:54.830
but would you be able
to take your own wicket?


1056
01:24:58.270 --> 01:24:59.030
No.

1057
01:25:00.070 --> 01:25:00.790
Why?

1058
01:25:01.110 --> 01:25:02.950
There's spin but no speed.

1059
01:25:04.030 --> 01:25:05.390
That nip is not there.

1060
01:25:05.630 --> 01:25:08.590
Any half-decent batter
will easily play such slow spin.


1061
01:25:09.150 --> 01:25:10.190
To get a wicket,

1062
01:25:10.310 --> 01:25:12.670
the ball should turn sharply...
like zuckkkk!


1063
01:25:12.990 --> 01:25:14.710
So what the 'zuck' are you waiting for?

1064
01:25:16.350 --> 01:25:18.670
If the ball needs more speed,
bowl with more speed.


1065
01:25:21.030 --> 01:25:21.550
More.

1066
01:25:24.150 --> 01:25:24.870
More!

1067
01:25:25.350 --> 01:25:26.710
Can't bowl faster than this, sir.

1068
01:25:26.870 --> 01:25:27.790
You can.

1069
01:25:29.150 --> 01:25:29.870
Bowl.

1070
01:25:30.790 --> 01:25:31.470
More...

1071
01:25:32.310 --> 01:25:32.990
More.

1072
01:25:38.510 --> 01:25:39.310
We're done.

1073
01:25:40.470 --> 01:25:41.030
Yes.

1074
01:25:47.310 --> 01:25:50.350
If you strain your shoulder,
it may get dislocated again.


1075
01:25:50.630 --> 01:25:52.630
Complete rest for two weeks.

1076
01:25:53.230 --> 01:25:55.110
Why? It's not so serious.

1077
01:25:55.270 --> 01:25:56.950
Now that you've set it,
why can't she bowl?


1078
01:25:57.110 --> 01:25:59.270
I've dislocated my shoulder
multiple times,


1079
01:25:59.510 --> 01:26:01.190
physio used to set it
and I was back on the field.


1080
01:26:01.310 --> 01:26:03.350
Mr Sodhi, get up and bowl.

1081
01:26:04.590 --> 01:26:06.510
Come on, get up... and bowl.

1082
01:26:09.830 --> 01:26:11.070
- Bowl?
- Yeah.


1083
01:26:13.790 --> 01:26:14.670
Stop.

1084
01:26:14.950 --> 01:26:16.750
When you bowl left arm,

1085
01:26:17.070 --> 01:26:20.030
your right arm automatically
swings back.


1086
01:26:20.470 --> 01:26:23.910
The reverse motion of the right arm
creates the momentum


1087
01:26:24.030 --> 01:26:26.670
that gives a left-arm bowler
that extra force.


1088
01:26:27.470 --> 01:26:30.750
That's why your left arm
can generate more pace


1089
01:26:31.190 --> 01:26:32.150
not Anina's.

1090
01:26:32.350 --> 01:26:34.910
To compensate for that momentum,

1091
01:26:35.150 --> 01:26:38.110
if she tries to generate the same force
with only one hand,


1092
01:26:38.230 --> 01:26:40.470
her shoulder could get
permanently damaged.


1093
01:26:41.590 --> 01:26:42.390
So, Anina...

1094
01:26:42.950 --> 01:26:45.550
Yes, sir, I know... basic Physics.

1095
01:26:46.270 --> 01:26:49.430
Mr Sodhi, I'm a doctor
but I'm an Indian too.


1096
01:26:50.070 --> 01:26:52.270
Cricket runs in my blood, too.

1097
01:26:52.950 --> 01:26:55.990
You've done more than you could

1098
01:26:56.590 --> 01:26:57.750
you've done your best.

1099
01:26:58.110 --> 01:26:58.950
Hello.

1100
01:27:00.230 --> 01:27:02.830
You here to offer your sympathies again?

1101
01:27:03.550 --> 01:27:05.350
- I was just trying to--
- Dad, ask him to get out.


1102
01:27:08.630 --> 01:27:11.270
Why is your timing always off?

1103
01:27:12.070 --> 01:27:13.310
Time the ball, no?

1104
01:27:14.630 --> 01:27:18.150
Momentum... how to generate momentum?

1105
01:27:24.550 --> 01:27:26.790
Momentum. Come on think.

1106
01:27:41.790 --> 01:27:42.990
Enough now.

1107
01:27:44.790 --> 01:27:45.710
Get me whisky.

1108
01:27:47.910 --> 01:27:48.910
Spin...

1109
01:27:49.270 --> 01:27:50.190
Momentum.

1110
01:27:51.510 --> 01:27:53.790
This 'mentum mentum'
will make you go mad!


1111
01:27:54.030 --> 01:27:56.270
Not here, idiot! Stupid woman.

1112
01:28:00.110 --> 01:28:01.350
Not on the pitch!

1113
01:28:01.470 --> 01:28:02.990
On the side... at short leg!

1114
01:28:06.910 --> 01:28:08.150
Is this short leg, you fool?

1115
01:28:08.270 --> 01:28:09.510
How do I know where short leg is!

1116
01:28:09.710 --> 01:28:11.230
Do short people field at that position?

1117
01:28:11.710 --> 01:28:13.630
It's not me, it's your cricket
that's foolish.


1118
01:28:13.830 --> 01:28:15.510
It's an English game
but all the English is wrong!


1119
01:28:15.630 --> 01:28:16.270
Short leg...

1120
01:28:16.390 --> 01:28:17.950
And slip?
Does everyone 'slip' over there?


1121
01:28:18.070 --> 01:28:19.310
Shut up and get out!

1122
01:28:19.430 --> 01:28:20.550
I'm already outside!

1123
01:28:20.750 --> 01:28:21.550
Say 'get in'.

1124
01:28:30.070 --> 01:28:32.430
Hey... what just happened?

1125
01:28:32.670 --> 01:28:34.030
'What just happened'?

1126
01:28:34.750 --> 01:28:36.030
I just escaped death.

1127
01:28:46.790 --> 01:28:48.390
We just escaped death.

1128
01:28:50.230 --> 01:28:51.870
Mr Padam Singh? Come in.

1129
01:28:52.830 --> 01:28:53.910
Tea? Coffee?

1130
01:29:01.710 --> 01:29:03.870
Welcome, my 'basic Physics' expert.

1131
01:29:04.550 --> 01:29:06.550
Shall we show the world...

1132
01:29:07.310 --> 01:29:08.430
momentum?

1133
01:29:35.630 --> 01:29:37.830
- Hello, sir.
- Well done, son...


1134
01:29:38.030 --> 01:29:39.470
fantastic absolutely.

1135
01:29:44.510 --> 01:29:46.470
You sent it to 'the' 
Bishan Singh Bedi?

1136
01:29:46.630 --> 01:29:49.830
The greatest left-arm spinner
the world has ever seen.


1137
01:29:50.550 --> 01:29:52.830
Not known for hiding his feelings.

1138
01:29:52.950 --> 01:29:54.950
You guys think Kajal is good, right?

1139
01:29:55.270 --> 01:29:56.350
Kajal can't...

1140
01:29:57.750 --> 01:29:59.510
- Sir, but...
- She hasn't played...


1141
01:30:06.270 --> 01:30:09.670
After the break,
she isn't consistent.


1142
01:30:10.750 --> 01:30:11.990
Bishan Singh Bedi?

1143
01:30:13.310 --> 01:30:14.550
- Carry on, guys.
- Okay.


1144
01:30:14.670 --> 01:30:16.070
- Kajal...
- No no no!


1145
01:30:24.110 --> 01:30:27.510
Guys, you should check this out.

1146
01:30:31.430 --> 01:30:32.510
Unbelievable!

1147
01:30:34.790 --> 01:30:35.790
Is this the same Anina?

1148
01:30:36.030 --> 01:30:37.790
If she doesn't have a twin sister,
it's her!


1149
01:30:38.070 --> 01:30:39.550
How is this possible?

1150
01:30:39.990 --> 01:30:41.190
She wasn't even a bowler.

1151
01:30:41.310 --> 01:30:42.630
There are a lot of free apps.

1152
01:30:42.750 --> 01:30:45.590
You can easily morph your face
on another body.


1153
01:30:50.350 --> 01:30:50.990
Hello?

1154
01:30:51.110 --> 01:30:53.110
Anina, this is Hemanti Dhingra

1155
01:30:53.310 --> 01:30:55.830
from the selection committee, remember?

1156
01:30:56.070 --> 01:30:56.870
Ani...

1157
01:30:57.110 --> 01:30:57.870
'Hello?'

1158
01:30:57.990 --> 01:30:59.030
Yes, ma'am?

1159
01:30:59.230 --> 01:31:00.110
Tell me, ma'am.

1160
01:31:00.230 --> 01:31:01.910
How are you?
Health wealth all okay?


1161
01:31:02.510 --> 01:31:04.270
Wealth same. Health better, ma'am.

1162
01:31:04.790 --> 01:31:06.190
Anina...

1163
01:31:08.830 --> 01:31:11.670
did you see a video?

1164
01:31:12.070 --> 01:31:13.110
Which video, ma'am?

1165
01:31:13.790 --> 01:31:15.430
You didn't see it?
I knew it.


1166
01:31:15.630 --> 01:31:17.350
'Technology is so advanced now...'

1167
01:31:17.590 --> 01:31:20.430
if you see it, you'll truly think
it's you who's bowling.


1168
01:31:20.710 --> 01:31:23.430
Truth will look like the truth, ma'am.

1169
01:31:26.630 --> 01:31:29.430
Are you seriously asking us
to consider her?


1170
01:31:29.710 --> 01:31:30.910
It is our job to make sure,

1171
01:31:31.030 --> 01:31:34.470
there is absolutely no discrimination
of any sort in this game.


1172
01:31:34.750 --> 01:31:37.590
Is she good enough to play
for India or not...


1173
01:31:38.270 --> 01:31:40.230
it is our duty to check that out.

1174
01:31:46.790 --> 01:31:47.710
Thank you, ma'am.

1175
01:31:49.030 --> 01:31:51.070
Granny, they are calling me
for the Indian camp!


1176
01:31:52.510 --> 01:31:55.310
Why are you underacting?
Show some emotion.


1177
01:31:55.910 --> 01:31:57.430
I'm a Federer fan.

1178
01:31:57.590 --> 01:31:59.030
We don't show our emotions.

1179
01:32:42.750 --> 01:32:43.870
Fantastic!

1180
01:32:44.110 --> 01:32:45.910
I've never seen anything like this.

1181
01:32:46.030 --> 01:32:48.150
But, one problem...
she won't be able to bat.


1182
01:32:48.270 --> 01:32:48.910
So?

1183
01:32:49.030 --> 01:32:50.430
B.S. Chandrashekhar couldn't bat.

1184
01:32:50.630 --> 01:32:53.790
Is she good enough to play
as a specialist bowler or not?


1185
01:32:53.910 --> 01:32:55.270
She is amazing.

1186
01:32:55.670 --> 01:32:56.830
A one-handed player...

1187
01:32:56.950 --> 01:32:58.310
in an international cricket team...

1188
01:32:58.550 --> 01:32:59.870
the media will go into a frenzy.

1189
01:33:02.390 --> 01:33:03.990
What a story, ma'am.

1190
01:33:04.790 --> 01:33:08.190
We should renegotiate
the telecast rights.


1191
01:33:08.630 --> 01:33:11.670
Mr Bhavik, I know you're
the Treasurer of the Cricket Board


1192
01:33:12.110 --> 01:33:16.110
but for once, please forget the treasure
and focus on the cricket.


1193
01:33:20.110 --> 01:33:23.350
Welcome to the first
A23 one-day international


1194
01:33:23.470 --> 01:33:25.390
between England and India.

1195
01:33:25.510 --> 01:33:27.750
News from the middle is
that England have won the toss


1196
01:33:27.870 --> 01:33:29.230
and elected to bat.

1197
01:33:35.150 --> 01:33:38.310
It's a historical day
in the game of cricket.


1198
01:33:49.270 --> 01:33:52.110
Look at Anina swinging
her left arm.


1199
01:33:53.030 --> 01:33:56.990
What a way to make
your international debut in cricket.


1200
01:33:57.150 --> 01:33:59.910
What a day for me to make my debut
as a commentator.


1201
01:34:05.070 --> 01:34:07.230
'Start of the innings... first ball.'

1202
01:34:08.230 --> 01:34:09.510
'Archer taking guard.'

1203
01:34:09.750 --> 01:34:12.830
'Six fielders on the offside
and three on the onside.'


1204
01:34:14.870 --> 01:34:17.630
Dipti from the Pavilion End to Archer.

1205
01:34:19.950 --> 01:34:22.190
Archer drives... through extra cover
for 4


1206
01:34:22.310 --> 01:34:23.710
and England are on their way.

1207
01:34:25.710 --> 01:34:26.870
Great wristwork... 4 runs.

1208
01:34:26.990 --> 01:34:28.350
Backfoot punch.
No chance to stop it.


1209
01:34:28.470 --> 01:34:30.110
Over mid-on... 4 runs.
Beautiful cover drive.


1210
01:34:30.230 --> 01:34:33.430
Played to Anina...
Not a clean pick up and throw.


1211
01:34:33.550 --> 01:34:34.710
1 run added.

1212
01:34:36.230 --> 01:34:37.910
Super shot over cover.

1213
01:34:39.350 --> 01:34:40.150
And 6 runs!

1214
01:34:40.270 --> 01:34:42.550
England off to a flying start here.

1215
01:34:43.390 --> 01:34:44.790
The first bowling change...

1216
01:34:44.910 --> 01:34:48.110
it's the girl that
we've all been waiting for.


1217
01:34:48.670 --> 01:34:51.550
The atmosphere is charged with emotion.

1218
01:34:51.670 --> 01:34:52.750
The question is...

1219
01:34:52.870 --> 01:34:55.910
will it play on the minds of the
English batters out in the middle?


1220
01:34:56.030 --> 01:34:59.430
I don't know about the English but
is it okay for an Indian to


1221
01:34:59.830 --> 01:35:01.670
shed a tear or two on live television?

1222
01:35:02.430 --> 01:35:03.630
I'm going to stand up.

1223
01:35:07.750 --> 01:35:08.830
'First match.'

1224
01:35:09.390 --> 01:35:10.510
'First over.'

1225
01:35:10.870 --> 01:35:11.750
'First ball.'

1226
01:35:14.790 --> 01:35:16.790
The entire stadium resounding
with applause.


1227
01:35:21.190 --> 01:35:22.710
Anina from the Pavilion End.

1228
01:35:22.950 --> 01:35:24.750
Left-arm around the wicket.

1229
01:35:26.990 --> 01:35:28.550
A comic moment in this drama.

1230
01:35:28.790 --> 01:35:31.150
Bowler in front of the umpire?
Or umpire in front of the bowler?


1231
01:35:31.270 --> 01:35:33.830
- Ever seen anything like this, Pankaj?
- Never.


1232
01:35:41.670 --> 01:35:43.550
Hearts racing...

1233
01:35:45.030 --> 01:35:49.590
Seems like time itself has stopped.

1234
01:35:56.030 --> 01:35:59.110
A loosener from Anina and
Searle smashes it over midwicket.


1235
01:35:59.230 --> 01:36:02.510
With this 6, Searle's score moves to 48.

1236
01:36:03.070 --> 01:36:04.350
She is in an attacking mood today.

1237
01:36:05.990 --> 01:36:07.350
Anina's second ball...

1238
01:36:10.310 --> 01:36:13.230
Outside the leg stump...
signalled a wide.


1239
01:36:13.830 --> 01:36:16.190
Can't imagine the pressure on the girl.

1240
01:36:16.710 --> 01:36:18.350
The captain is having a chat with her.

1241
01:36:18.550 --> 01:36:21.030
Think she's telling her to focus
on her line and length.


1242
01:36:22.150 --> 01:36:23.310
Anina's next ball...

1243
01:36:27.950 --> 01:36:28.990
This was a good ball.

1244
01:36:29.430 --> 01:36:31.910
Correct line and length.
Searle forced to defend.


1245
01:36:35.590 --> 01:36:37.670
The batter takes two steps
outside the crease.


1246
01:36:37.790 --> 01:36:40.230
Let's see if Anina can adjust
her length.


1247
01:36:43.350 --> 01:36:44.990
Bang on middle stump... correct length.

1248
01:36:45.190 --> 01:36:46.790
No chance to play an attacking shot.

1249
01:36:52.470 --> 01:36:54.510
Slowly gaining confidence...

1250
01:36:55.030 --> 01:36:56.990
Anina is back to her bowling mark.

1251
01:36:59.390 --> 01:37:01.310
In... comes... Anina...

1252
01:37:03.950 --> 01:37:05.070
What was that?

1253
01:37:07.310 --> 01:37:08.550
What was that arrow!

1254
01:37:12.230 --> 01:37:14.190
Batters, spectators...
everyone in shock.


1255
01:37:15.230 --> 01:37:16.470
Just look at that.

1256
01:37:31.710 --> 01:37:33.510
A spinning spinner.

1257
01:37:33.870 --> 01:37:35.350
She is a Ghoomer.

1258
01:37:35.950 --> 01:37:36.990
A Ghoom-what?

1259
01:37:37.230 --> 01:37:38.150
Pacer...

1260
01:37:38.430 --> 01:37:39.390
Spinner...

1261
01:37:40.670 --> 01:37:41.550
Ghoomer!

1262
01:37:46.230 --> 01:37:48.750
'The momentum that's gained
by the swing of the right hand...'


1263
01:37:48.870 --> 01:37:51.430
'will be achieved by spinning
your body.'


1264
01:37:51.630 --> 01:37:53.870
'If you spin, the ball will spin.'

1265
01:37:54.030 --> 01:37:54.670
Zuckkkk!

1266
01:37:59.870 --> 01:38:01.910
There's a lot of confusion out there.

1267
01:38:02.030 --> 01:38:04.110
Is it within the laws of the game?

1268
01:38:04.310 --> 01:38:06.110
Batters can do whatever they want...

1269
01:38:06.230 --> 01:38:09.150
switch from being a righty to a lefty
mid-delivery.


1270
01:38:09.270 --> 01:38:11.390
Switch hit, reverse sweep...
are all legal.


1271
01:38:11.510 --> 01:38:13.230
Why can't a bowler change her action?

1272
01:38:14.590 --> 01:38:17.110
Sorry, switching from
English to Hindi...


1273
01:38:17.310 --> 01:38:19.470
Is that within the laws of the game?

1274
01:38:19.630 --> 01:38:20.670
Law 21...

1275
01:38:21.470 --> 01:38:24.110
ICC Book of Cricket Rules.
Allowed.


1276
01:38:24.550 --> 01:38:27.870
You can change action.
As long as you bowl with the same hand


1277
01:38:28.150 --> 01:38:30.270
and from the same side of the wicket.

1278
01:38:30.630 --> 01:38:33.070
Anina from the Pavilion End...
spinning around.


1279
01:38:33.350 --> 01:38:34.790
An appeal!

1280
01:38:34.950 --> 01:38:37.110
It's a leg bye.
Struck outside the leg stump.


1281
01:38:37.230 --> 01:38:38.630
End of a unique over.

1282
01:38:38.750 --> 01:38:43.030
"Ghoom Ghoom Ghoomer spinning."

1283
01:38:43.990 --> 01:38:45.950
After the dance performance
of the last over...


1284
01:38:46.230 --> 01:38:47.350
back to cricket.

1285
01:38:47.590 --> 01:38:49.190
Anjali in to Searle.

1286
01:38:49.590 --> 01:38:50.870
It's up in the air...

1287
01:38:52.230 --> 01:38:53.310
And she's out!

1288
01:38:55.910 --> 01:38:58.230
Caught Dipti, bowled Anjali...

1289
01:38:58.350 --> 01:38:59.670
and Anina?

1290
01:38:59.950 --> 01:39:01.790
'Bowling has partnerships too.'

1291
01:39:01.910 --> 01:39:03.990
Sometimes a wicket falls

1292
01:39:04.870 --> 01:39:07.710
'due to pressure created
in the previous over.'


1293
01:39:08.150 --> 01:39:09.750
'Last ball from Anjali.'

1294
01:39:11.030 --> 01:39:12.790
'No runs. End of the over.'

1295
01:39:20.710 --> 01:39:23.990
"Ghoom Ghoom Ghoomer spinning."

1296
01:39:25.710 --> 01:39:27.190
That's my song!

1297
01:39:29.790 --> 01:39:32.470
They think, copyright means...
everyone has the right to copy.


1298
01:39:34.070 --> 01:39:35.270
No... I'll explain later.

1299
01:39:35.710 --> 01:39:37.110
Anina spins again...

1300
01:39:41.990 --> 01:39:44.750
Boom boom boom!
One bullet ball after another.


1301
01:39:46.430 --> 01:39:49.470
'After two balls, the surprise
won't stay a surprise.'


1302
01:39:50.030 --> 01:39:51.630
After zuck zuck zuck...

1303
01:39:53.350 --> 01:39:54.910
...zzzuuuuuck.

1304
01:40:01.030 --> 01:40:04.230
That is her first wicket in cricket.

1305
01:40:04.590 --> 01:40:05.790
'This is called deception.'

1306
01:40:05.910 --> 01:40:08.550
'This is not just a thinking bowler
this is an out-thinking bowler.'


1307
01:40:09.550 --> 01:40:11.750
Great, fantastic, mind-blowing, miracle.

1308
01:40:18.430 --> 01:40:20.110
Beautiful. Beautiful deception.

1309
01:40:20.230 --> 01:40:21.470
Ghoomer became a floater.

1310
01:40:21.590 --> 01:40:24.430
A small change in pace...
Archer back to the pavilion.


1311
01:40:24.550 --> 01:40:27.190
Next in, Camila Williams, the captain.

1312
01:40:27.310 --> 01:40:30.190
Archer telling her, I'm sure,
of Anina's change of pace.


1313
01:40:30.390 --> 01:40:32.150
She just got out, what will she advise!

1314
01:40:32.790 --> 01:40:35.550
Sorry, Williams taking guard.

1315
01:40:41.590 --> 01:40:44.070
Anina... looking for her second wicket.

1316
01:40:44.350 --> 01:40:46.590
The English captain, the best batter
in the team...


1317
01:40:47.030 --> 01:40:47.990
Camila Williams.

1318
01:40:48.110 --> 01:40:50.510
Scored three centuries in
one-day cricket this year.


1319
01:40:50.630 --> 01:40:51.830
Come on, Ani!

1320
01:40:55.310 --> 01:40:55.990
Stumped!

1321
01:41:10.310 --> 01:41:13.630
In the umpire's goggles,
the spinning Ghoomer sees


1322
01:41:13.750 --> 01:41:15.310
Williams coming forward.

1323
01:41:15.710 --> 01:41:18.070
Goggle... became Google.

1324
01:41:18.190 --> 01:41:21.310
If you're not watching this,
you're missing something.


1325
01:41:22.030 --> 01:41:25.750
'Get to the ground, get to a TV,
radio, phone...'


1326
01:41:25.870 --> 01:41:27.070
'get to something.'

1327
01:41:27.190 --> 01:41:29.270
'Cricket is being Ghoomered!'

1328
01:41:35.550 --> 01:41:37.310
Bowling change from the far end.

1329
01:41:37.870 --> 01:41:40.350
Bernadette thrashes this one for 4.

1330
01:41:40.870 --> 01:41:41.870
'Cracking shot!'

1331
01:41:43.270 --> 01:41:46.350
'Looks like the English have decided to
go after the bowling at the other end.'


1332
01:41:46.470 --> 01:41:48.550
16 runs from that over.

1333
01:41:53.750 --> 01:41:55.110
Start of Ghoomer's third over.

1334
01:42:01.430 --> 01:42:02.390
Come on.

1335
01:42:02.510 --> 01:42:04.430
An easy catch dropped in the slips.

1336
01:42:04.950 --> 01:42:05.750
Sorry...

1337
01:42:05.870 --> 01:42:07.230
commentator... neutral...

1338
01:42:07.550 --> 01:42:08.470
Stiff upper lip.

1339
01:42:08.590 --> 01:42:09.550
I'm an Aussie.

1340
01:42:09.790 --> 01:42:10.630
Sorry, mate.

1341
01:42:11.030 --> 01:42:12.030
Next ball.

1342
01:42:12.870 --> 01:42:13.550
Shot!

1343
01:42:13.670 --> 01:42:16.630
Over the long on boundary... 6 runs.

1344
01:42:16.830 --> 01:42:19.350
The ball was a bit short,
easily hit for 6.


1345
01:42:19.950 --> 01:42:21.110
Next ball.

1346
01:42:21.590 --> 01:42:24.550
Short and Bernadette pulls it
through square leg for 4.


1347
01:42:24.670 --> 01:42:27.510
The English batters have decided,
attack is the best form of defence.


1348
01:42:27.630 --> 01:42:28.470
What a shot! 4 runs!

1349
01:42:28.750 --> 01:42:31.710
'Has the dropped catch
affected her length, I wonder.'


1350
01:42:32.670 --> 01:42:34.830
Looks like Bernadette
has managed to rattle her


1351
01:42:34.950 --> 01:42:35.710
with her aggression.

1352
01:42:35.830 --> 01:42:37.670
Fantastic batting by Bernadette.

1353
01:42:37.790 --> 01:42:39.470
Pin-drop silence in the stadium.

1354
01:42:42.230 --> 01:42:43.830
Anina in deep thought.

1355
01:42:48.750 --> 01:42:49.230
Yes!

1356
01:42:49.350 --> 01:42:50.550
'Clean bowled!'

1357
01:42:51.190 --> 01:42:54.070
When you bowl a yorker

1358
01:42:54.310 --> 01:42:57.150
the greatest batter looks like a joker.

1359
01:42:57.870 --> 01:42:58.390
Sorry.

1360
01:42:58.510 --> 01:43:01.150
Poetry in cricket brings out
the poet in me.


1361
01:43:01.270 --> 01:43:04.430
116 for 4. And I'm so sorry
to be breaking into Hindi.


1362
01:43:04.670 --> 01:43:05.710
Sounds beautiful.

1363
01:43:12.190 --> 01:43:14.870
Just a one step run-up
but what a fast yorker!


1364
01:43:16.190 --> 01:43:18.390
The concentration-smoothie-effect.

1365
01:43:21.430 --> 01:43:22.590
Ghoomer!

1366
01:43:26.190 --> 01:43:27.590
Spin from the other end too.

1367
01:43:29.470 --> 01:43:31.190
'A good shot... boundary.'

1368
01:43:32.270 --> 01:43:33.590
'Nasreen right-arm over.'

1369
01:43:33.790 --> 01:43:36.470
'Played towards midwicket... 1 run.'

1370
01:43:37.030 --> 01:43:38.150
'Next ball.'

1371
01:43:38.350 --> 01:43:40.790
'Great shot... ball is in the air...'

1372
01:43:40.910 --> 01:43:41.710
Out!

1373
01:43:42.790 --> 01:43:45.110
With that, England lose
their fifth wicket.


1374
01:43:46.470 --> 01:43:48.630
End of a successful over by Nasreen.

1375
01:43:51.230 --> 01:43:52.630
'Anina's fourth over...'

1376
01:43:53.230 --> 01:43:55.990
Looks like the captain will make
her bowl all 10 overs together


1377
01:43:56.190 --> 01:43:58.430
that is if England isn't bowled out
by then!


1378
01:43:59.870 --> 01:44:01.870
A non-Ghoomer delivery.
Lot of spin.


1379
01:44:04.070 --> 01:44:05.990
Straight action... sharp turn again.

1380
01:44:06.550 --> 01:44:07.950
The batter expecting a Ghoomer

1381
01:44:08.070 --> 01:44:10.390
but Anina bowling straight
and deceiving her.


1382
01:44:13.030 --> 01:44:14.230
The ball is in the air...

1383
01:44:15.070 --> 01:44:16.670
MINE!

1384
01:44:23.670 --> 01:44:24.950
She drops it.

1385
01:44:25.190 --> 01:44:27.590
That was a wrong one
that deceived Amber.


1386
01:44:29.630 --> 01:44:32.070
There was no time
for catching practice!


1387
01:44:32.430 --> 01:44:34.310
The ball was on Anina's
right side...


1388
01:44:34.430 --> 01:44:36.710
maybe someone else
should've gone for it.


1389
01:44:36.830 --> 01:44:39.150
Maybe someone else
should've been commentating.


1390
01:44:41.550 --> 01:44:43.790
A Jonty Rhodes like you
also misses a catch!


1391
01:44:44.030 --> 01:44:46.710
Mr Sunny is commentating over there,
may I sit here?


1392
01:44:46.830 --> 01:44:48.310
- But, sir...
- I'm fine.


1393
01:44:48.630 --> 01:44:49.950
Please carry on.

1394
01:44:50.070 --> 01:44:52.630
And to bowl the over's
last delivery, Amit--


1395
01:44:52.750 --> 01:44:54.550
er, Anina comes in.

1396
01:44:57.510 --> 01:44:59.110
And Amber out.
Caught and bowled!


1397
01:44:59.230 --> 01:45:00.150
Great catch.

1398
01:45:03.110 --> 01:45:03.910
Fluke!

1399
01:45:04.790 --> 01:45:07.110
It looks like, she has hurt herself.

1400
01:45:11.550 --> 01:45:12.950
The physio coming on to the field.

1401
01:45:15.390 --> 01:45:17.550
'Anina is leaving the field.'

1402
01:45:19.350 --> 01:45:21.470
Even if she retires hurt now...

1403
01:45:21.830 --> 01:45:25.390
she will have left her mark
in cricketing history.


1404
01:45:25.710 --> 01:45:28.430
Only those who have no desire
to move forward...


1405
01:45:28.910 --> 01:45:30.510
look back at their achievements.

1406
01:45:30.670 --> 01:45:32.870
Don't look back.
The camera is on you.


1407
01:45:34.390 --> 01:45:36.310
4 overs 28 runs and 4 wickets.

1408
01:45:38.150 --> 01:45:39.190
Hello.

1409
01:45:41.430 --> 01:45:42.350
May I go in?

1410
01:45:43.190 --> 01:45:44.190
Are you ice?

1411
01:45:45.630 --> 01:45:47.430
Then you have no work inside.

1412
01:45:54.430 --> 01:45:56.630
Goes on her knees,
clears the boundary,


1413
01:45:56.870 --> 01:45:57.470
6 runs.

1414
01:45:59.470 --> 01:46:01.550
A lofted shot straight to long on.

1415
01:46:02.350 --> 01:46:03.910
Oh ho... 4 runs.

1416
01:46:04.030 --> 01:46:06.150
Played between point and gully...

1417
01:46:08.670 --> 01:46:10.830
Whacked over mid on...

1418
01:46:11.110 --> 01:46:12.150
What are they bowling?

1419
01:46:12.630 --> 01:46:14.670
Drives through extra cover for 4.

1420
01:46:15.550 --> 01:46:17.470
Ball is in the air... 6 runs!

1421
01:46:18.630 --> 01:46:19.790
Welcome back, Amitabh.

1422
01:46:19.910 --> 01:46:22.830
Looks like a whole new game out there
without the left-arm Ghoomer.


1423
01:46:23.230 --> 01:46:25.710
'England's middle order wreaking havoc
in Anina's absence.'


1424
01:46:25.830 --> 01:46:26.510
Go.

1425
01:46:26.630 --> 01:46:27.750
'India again on the back foot.'

1426
01:46:27.870 --> 01:46:28.590
Go!

1427
01:46:34.110 --> 01:46:35.110
According to the rules...

1428
01:46:35.230 --> 01:46:37.230
when a bowler stays off the field
for a period of time...


1429
01:46:37.430 --> 01:46:39.670
she has to wait
for the same amount of time...


1430
01:46:39.790 --> 01:46:40.950
to bowl again.

1431
01:46:41.230 --> 01:46:44.310
Batsman can retire hurt and
come back anytime and play.


1432
01:46:45.190 --> 01:46:46.990
But a bowler has
to come back and wait.

1433
01:46:47.110 --> 01:46:48.070
Who made these rules?

1434
01:46:48.510 --> 01:46:50.550
You know, the Brits owe us
more than one explanation.


1435
01:46:51.710 --> 01:46:52.870
Lofted... 4 runs.

1436
01:46:52.990 --> 01:46:54.070
A great cover drive.

1437
01:46:54.190 --> 01:46:56.030
Shot! No fielder at deep midwicket...

1438
01:46:56.150 --> 01:46:58.110
England know that they have a few overs

1439
01:46:58.230 --> 01:46:59.550
before Anina returns to bowl

1440
01:46:59.670 --> 01:47:01.910
and boy, are they cashing
in before that.


1441
01:47:02.790 --> 01:47:04.470
Played towards midwicket,

1442
01:47:04.590 --> 01:47:07.510
first run taken quickly...
Anina's dive saves a boundary.


1443
01:47:07.790 --> 01:47:09.430
And... a strong throw...

1444
01:47:09.590 --> 01:47:11.230
this can be a close call.

1445
01:47:11.390 --> 01:47:12.670
240 for 7.

1446
01:47:15.750 --> 01:47:16.990
Referred to the third umpire.

1447
01:47:17.150 --> 01:47:18.630
Why do you need a third umpire?

1448
01:47:20.550 --> 01:47:21.670
And that's out!

1449
01:47:25.270 --> 01:47:27.070
A run out is not a bowler's wicket.

1450
01:47:31.390 --> 01:47:33.510
Captain Dipti speaking to the umpire.

1451
01:47:38.390 --> 01:47:40.430
'The entire stadium has come alive.'

1452
01:47:41.910 --> 01:47:43.030
Ghoomer!

1453
01:47:46.470 --> 01:47:48.590
'Anina's fifth over
from the Pavilion End.'


1454
01:47:53.350 --> 01:47:54.590
The field is spread out.

1455
01:47:54.830 --> 01:47:58.270
Let's see if Anina's injury
will affect her bowling.


1456
01:47:59.030 --> 01:48:00.190
Nicole on strike.

1457
01:48:01.310 --> 01:48:03.030
Anina, left arm, around the wicket.

1458
01:48:04.470 --> 01:48:06.470
The shot piercing the field...

1459
01:48:09.150 --> 01:48:10.510
A change in the field.

1460
01:48:10.830 --> 01:48:13.670
Fielders are being brought in
instead of being spread out!


1461
01:48:14.070 --> 01:48:15.110
What's going on?

1462
01:48:16.670 --> 01:48:18.670
Slips, gully, forward short leg
and silly point?


1463
01:48:18.910 --> 01:48:20.150
Ghoomer thinking!

1464
01:48:20.390 --> 01:48:21.670
'Hurt the ego.'

1465
01:48:22.070 --> 01:48:23.270
'You won't need to take the wicket,'

1466
01:48:23.390 --> 01:48:24.790
'the batter will give it away herself.'

1467
01:48:25.310 --> 01:48:27.030
A drunkard bowling to me?

1468
01:48:27.390 --> 01:48:30.870
'This ego led someone to give up
their wicket.'


1469
01:48:31.430 --> 01:48:32.350
Remember?

1470
01:48:35.870 --> 01:48:36.590
Out!

1471
01:48:36.950 --> 01:48:39.390
It's a five-wicket haul on debut

1472
01:48:39.510 --> 01:48:40.670
for this cricketing wonder.

1473
01:48:40.790 --> 01:48:42.870
A bouncer from a spinner!

1474
01:48:43.430 --> 01:48:44.270
Spinner?

1475
01:48:44.670 --> 01:48:45.190
Pfft!

1476
01:49:01.910 --> 01:49:03.670
266 for 8 wickets.

1477
01:49:03.870 --> 01:49:05.950
Dipti, right-arm over the wicket.

1478
01:49:06.430 --> 01:49:07.350
That's leg before.

1479
01:49:07.470 --> 01:49:08.790
And that's the 9th wicket.

1480
01:49:11.870 --> 01:49:12.870
Clean bowled.

1481
01:49:12.990 --> 01:49:16.110
England all out for 266.

1482
01:49:16.470 --> 01:49:18.630
12 overs wasted.

1483
01:49:18.870 --> 01:49:21.630
Wickets falling in a heap at the end.

1484
01:49:30.630 --> 01:49:33.190
And after all that drama,
it's a pretty decent score


1485
01:49:33.310 --> 01:49:35.550
which will require some getting.

1486
01:49:35.670 --> 01:49:37.830
Remember India have just 10 batters.

1487
01:49:37.950 --> 01:49:39.790
The Ghoomer does not bat.

1488
01:49:39.910 --> 01:49:41.070
SKY bowls?

1489
01:49:41.190 --> 01:49:42.030
Virat bowls?

1490
01:49:42.150 --> 01:49:43.910
Rohit bowls? KL bowls?

1491
01:49:44.310 --> 01:49:45.550
Batters don't bowl...

1492
01:49:45.670 --> 01:49:47.070
why should she have to bat?

1493
01:49:51.590 --> 01:49:52.710
Before she can catch her breath...

1494
01:49:52.830 --> 01:49:54.830
they start hounding with mics
and questions.


1495
01:49:55.110 --> 01:49:56.550
Let the match get over first!

1496
01:50:06.510 --> 01:50:07.710
Sir?

1497
01:50:10.630 --> 01:50:13.230
They say, you can't clap
with one hand.


1498
01:50:13.350 --> 01:50:16.350
But this one hand
has created an applause


1499
01:50:16.470 --> 01:50:18.430
that will echo for years.

1500
01:50:28.150 --> 01:50:30.350
- Hello?
- 'What fabulous bowling, Ghoomer!'


1501
01:50:30.470 --> 01:50:31.870
Rasika, why aren't you here?

1502
01:50:31.990 --> 01:50:34.430
Paddy brother said, in the ground
you can't see much from a distance


1503
01:50:34.550 --> 01:50:35.270
TV is better.

1504
01:50:36.950 --> 01:50:40.150
Start of the Indian innings...
target 267.


1505
01:50:41.110 --> 01:50:44.070
Evans to Dipti,
right-arm over the wicket.


1506
01:50:45.310 --> 01:50:46.990
Cracking shot.

1507
01:50:47.350 --> 01:50:49.230
'The Indian innings on its way.'

1508
01:50:50.230 --> 01:50:52.710
Outside off, played between
gully and point... 4 runs.


1509
01:50:56.070 --> 01:50:58.550
Great timing. No chance to stop it.

1510
01:50:59.910 --> 01:51:00.670
Oh ho ho!

1511
01:51:00.790 --> 01:51:03.030
Wherever you place the fielders,
we'll hit it over them.


1512
01:51:03.510 --> 01:51:05.110
Dipti off to a flyer.

1513
01:51:06.230 --> 01:51:07.110
An appeal...

1514
01:51:07.590 --> 01:51:08.310
and out!

1515
01:51:08.790 --> 01:51:10.190
India lose their first wicket.

1516
01:51:14.950 --> 01:51:16.750
Trying to steal a single here...

1517
01:51:17.430 --> 01:51:18.350
saved by a whisker.

1518
01:51:18.470 --> 01:51:19.990
That could've been a run out.

1519
01:51:20.150 --> 01:51:22.190
We have 38 overs.
We need only 5 runs per over.


1520
01:51:24.190 --> 01:51:25.030
Way outside off.

1521
01:51:25.150 --> 01:51:25.990
Play straight.

1522
01:51:28.070 --> 01:51:31.310
For her, playing straight means
straight over mid off.


1523
01:51:32.430 --> 01:51:35.070
Runs flowing off Dipti's bat.

1524
01:51:35.270 --> 01:51:37.390
This crazy girl is batting like
it's a T20.


1525
01:51:37.510 --> 01:51:39.870
- You won't get a chance to bat.
- Shall I take off my pads?


1526
01:51:43.750 --> 01:51:44.710
Next ball.

1527
01:51:44.830 --> 01:51:46.150
A bullet-like straight drive.

1528
01:51:46.270 --> 01:51:47.270
Shot!

1529
01:51:49.790 --> 01:51:51.390
- Are you okay?
- Yes, sir.


1530
01:51:52.030 --> 01:51:53.070
Williams to Shreya.

1531
01:51:53.350 --> 01:51:54.190
Driven square.

1532
01:52:03.110 --> 01:52:04.350
Bernadette to Shreya...

1533
01:52:05.190 --> 01:52:06.310
And... out!

1534
01:52:06.670 --> 01:52:07.670
Caught and bowled.

1535
01:52:11.030 --> 01:52:11.870
Next ball...

1536
01:52:13.310 --> 01:52:14.150
played in the air...

1537
01:52:14.270 --> 01:52:15.870
a fielder coming under it... and out!

1538
01:52:15.990 --> 01:52:17.390
Third wicket down for India.

1539
01:52:17.670 --> 01:52:19.190
Beautifully done there by England.

1540
01:52:21.110 --> 01:52:21.950
A flighted delivery...

1541
01:52:22.390 --> 01:52:23.270
bowled!

1542
01:52:24.870 --> 01:52:27.870
Within a few moments,
a cloud of gloom has descended.


1543
01:52:33.110 --> 01:52:34.350
A cracking shot by Dipti.

1544
01:52:34.870 --> 01:52:35.710
Out!

1545
01:52:37.590 --> 01:52:40.030
'Right shot but the placement
was wrong.'


1546
01:52:42.150 --> 01:52:45.110
This is called snatching defeat
from the jaws of victory!


1547
01:52:47.590 --> 01:52:49.150
We can still win it.
Play out Evans--


1548
01:52:49.790 --> 01:52:53.270
Cricket can be a funny game but
the Indians are not laughing.


1549
01:52:53.470 --> 01:52:55.750
Williams with four wickets
and her tail up...


1550
01:52:55.870 --> 01:52:58.190
just two wickets to go
for an English win.


1551
01:52:58.510 --> 01:53:00.630
31 runs for an Indian win.

1552
01:53:01.470 --> 01:53:02.350
Williams' next ball...

1553
01:53:04.110 --> 01:53:05.870
Sets off for a quick single.

1554
01:53:06.150 --> 01:53:07.550
This could be close.

1555
01:53:10.750 --> 01:53:11.710
Super shot!

1556
01:53:11.910 --> 01:53:13.350
Played in the gap...

1557
01:53:13.790 --> 01:53:15.950
fielder dives... 4 runs.

1558
01:53:17.070 --> 01:53:18.430
Another great shot.

1559
01:53:19.110 --> 01:53:20.830
Defensive push.
Another misfield.


1560
01:53:21.430 --> 01:53:22.310
Bernadette.

1561
01:53:22.870 --> 01:53:23.910
Yorker.

1562
01:53:24.710 --> 01:53:26.150
Tempers going up in the field.

1563
01:53:26.350 --> 01:53:28.670
It's all about who keeps a cooler head.

1564
01:53:29.950 --> 01:53:31.470
A gentle push for 1 run.

1565
01:53:32.510 --> 01:53:35.350
Runs coming in singles,
India moving towards its target.


1566
01:53:40.710 --> 01:53:41.590
Another single.

1567
01:53:41.710 --> 01:53:43.550
Just simple responsible batting

1568
01:53:43.670 --> 01:53:45.870
has put India back in the driver's seat.

1569
01:53:45.990 --> 01:53:47.510
Only 10 more runs to win.

1570
01:53:47.630 --> 01:53:50.270
Fantastic shot... 6 runs.

1571
01:53:50.510 --> 01:53:51.830
Only 4 more runs to win.

1572
01:53:52.350 --> 01:53:54.030
It's good to see you smiling again.

1573
01:53:54.190 --> 01:53:56.030
We Indians have a great
sense of humor...


1574
01:53:56.750 --> 01:53:57.710
when we are winning.

1575
01:53:57.910 --> 01:54:00.270
India on the brink of victory.

1576
01:54:00.390 --> 01:54:03.030
India one shot away from victory.

1577
01:54:03.150 --> 01:54:05.590
Williams... the ball is up in the air,
towards mid on...


1578
01:54:06.590 --> 01:54:07.470
and she's out!

1579
01:54:07.670 --> 01:54:09.390
Another irresponsible shot.

1580
01:54:09.510 --> 01:54:10.430
Caught at mid on.

1581
01:54:10.550 --> 01:54:12.510
England one wicket away from victory.

1582
01:54:12.630 --> 01:54:13.830
This is a nail-biter.

1583
01:54:13.950 --> 01:54:16.950
Only 4 more runs needed...
so many overs left.


1584
01:54:17.630 --> 01:54:19.150
When singles can do the job...

1585
01:54:19.270 --> 01:54:21.190
why play such a bad shot?

1586
01:54:26.830 --> 01:54:28.470
Preeta, just play straight okay.

1587
01:54:28.590 --> 01:54:30.470
You can do it. Come on.
Best of luck.


1588
01:54:31.910 --> 01:54:33.350
'Best of luck.'

1589
01:54:37.270 --> 01:54:41.750
After all the hard work, courage,
passion and fame...


1590
01:54:42.430 --> 01:54:44.510
it all comes down to luck!

1591
01:54:46.270 --> 01:54:47.630
Tension in the air.

1592
01:54:47.750 --> 01:54:48.630
Bernadette.

1593
01:54:48.910 --> 01:54:50.070
Bowled above waist height.

1594
01:54:50.190 --> 01:54:52.550
And it's a no ball.
India have got a free hit.


1595
01:54:52.750 --> 01:54:54.950
'Luck is going India's way.'

1596
01:54:55.550 --> 01:54:57.830
Seems, Luck is playing on our side.

1597
01:54:58.190 --> 01:54:59.350
3 runs to win.

1598
01:54:59.470 --> 01:55:01.470
It's a free hit...
can hit it anywhere.


1599
01:55:01.830 --> 01:55:02.510
Bernadette...

1600
01:55:02.630 --> 01:55:03.630
batter swings...

1601
01:55:03.750 --> 01:55:04.670
straight to the fielder.

1602
01:55:04.790 --> 01:55:06.470
Throw... she knocks the bails off...

1603
01:55:06.670 --> 01:55:08.670
'The English team looks confident.'

1604
01:55:09.030 --> 01:55:10.790
How can Luck play...

1605
01:55:13.750 --> 01:55:15.630
when I have snatched it away?

1606
01:55:16.390 --> 01:55:18.030
Lady with the sacred thread!

1607
01:55:26.950 --> 01:55:28.030
Nervous faces.

1608
01:55:28.150 --> 01:55:29.910
Everyone holding their breath...

1609
01:55:30.030 --> 01:55:31.790
waiting for the Third Umpire's decision.

1610
01:55:32.150 --> 01:55:33.230
That night...

1611
01:55:33.350 --> 01:55:35.910
'I didn't get booze...
abused... fought...'


1612
01:55:36.030 --> 01:55:37.630
'bought booze... drank...'

1613
01:55:37.750 --> 01:55:39.270
'thought I hit something on the road...'

1614
01:55:39.390 --> 01:55:40.990
'didn't see anything... kept driving...'

1615
01:55:41.110 --> 01:55:42.150
'reached home... fell asleep...'

1616
01:55:42.270 --> 01:55:44.030
'woke up next morning...'

1617
01:55:44.270 --> 01:55:45.190
'read the news...'

1618
01:55:45.310 --> 01:55:46.750
'went to find out...'

1619
01:55:47.270 --> 01:55:48.510
'but found...'

1620
01:55:49.070 --> 01:55:50.670
'Lady with the sacred thread.'

1621
01:56:02.230 --> 01:56:03.350
And that's out!

1622
01:56:03.630 --> 01:56:05.310
England win by 2 runs.

1623
01:56:12.870 --> 01:56:14.670
'England's bowling deserves praise.'

1624
01:56:15.070 --> 01:56:19.390
But I must say the Indian batters
helped them a lot.


1625
01:56:37.350 --> 01:56:39.550
In this International One-day series,

1626
01:56:39.870 --> 01:56:41.350
they lead 1--

1627
01:56:41.790 --> 01:56:43.150
What's going on?

1628
01:57:09.510 --> 01:57:11.670
I'm sorry, the English language

1629
01:57:11.910 --> 01:57:15.630
is too understated
for my emotions right now.


1630
01:57:19.790 --> 01:57:22.950
Wherever you are in the 195 countries
of the world...


1631
01:57:23.230 --> 01:57:24.990
whatever the colour of your skin...

1632
01:57:25.470 --> 01:57:27.110
whether you're Indian or English...

1633
01:57:27.230 --> 01:57:28.750
stand up and salute...

1634
01:57:29.270 --> 01:57:30.510
salute this game...

1635
01:57:31.470 --> 01:57:33.790
which can bring out
so much passion.


1636
01:57:35.950 --> 01:57:38.710
No matter who wins today...

1637
01:57:40.190 --> 01:57:42.190
the real winner is walking in...

1638
01:57:42.510 --> 01:57:43.870
wearing one glove...

1639
01:57:44.190 --> 01:57:45.590
and holding a bat...

1640
01:57:45.910 --> 01:57:46.990
in her only hand.

1641
01:57:48.830 --> 01:57:51.310
An incredible moment in cricket.

1642
01:57:52.230 --> 01:57:53.910
Anina at the non-striker end.

1643
01:57:54.110 --> 01:57:57.230
Must take a single
to keep Anina off strike.


1644
01:57:59.070 --> 01:57:59.950
Bernadette.

1645
01:58:02.070 --> 01:58:04.550
She sets off for a run...
Anina sends her back.


1646
01:58:07.270 --> 01:58:08.790
Correct decision.

1647
01:58:10.790 --> 01:58:12.990
3 runs to get for India.

1648
01:58:13.230 --> 01:58:15.510
1 wicket to get for England.

1649
01:58:16.190 --> 01:58:18.350
Anina taking guard.

1650
01:58:21.390 --> 01:58:22.790
I love this game.

1651
01:58:24.830 --> 01:58:26.310
Just love it!

1652
01:58:32.870 --> 01:58:35.550
The whole stadium reverberating.

1653
01:58:42.070 --> 01:58:45.030
Evans from the Pavilion End,
to Anina.


1654
01:58:49.310 --> 01:58:50.950
The ball has beaten her bat

1655
01:58:51.070 --> 01:58:53.550
and the noise is for a 100.

1656
01:58:53.790 --> 01:58:56.150
Captain Williams bringing
the fielders in.


1657
01:58:58.070 --> 01:58:59.310
Attacking field.

1658
01:59:01.630 --> 01:59:02.510
Anina.

1659
01:59:06.590 --> 01:59:07.430
Evans...

1660
01:59:11.390 --> 01:59:12.750
This is heart breaking.

1661
01:59:12.870 --> 01:59:13.830
No.

1662
01:59:14.430 --> 01:59:16.070
This is sport.

1663
01:59:16.350 --> 01:59:19.150
This is what makes life worth living.

1664
01:59:22.710 --> 01:59:25.190
'Whether you go right to left,
or left to right...'


1665
01:59:25.310 --> 01:59:26.630
'Anina is Anina.'

1666
01:59:27.910 --> 01:59:29.830
She's taking a left-hander's stance.

1667
01:59:30.590 --> 01:59:33.430
Only a third man
to stop a lucky edge.

1668
01:59:33.710 --> 01:59:35.870
Everybody else around the bat.

1669
01:59:36.550 --> 01:59:37.830
Can she get an edge?

1670
01:59:38.470 --> 01:59:39.790
Can she survive?

1671
02:00:25.950 --> 02:00:28.070
"Raise a toast to yourself"

1672
02:00:28.350 --> 02:00:29.830
"To your spirit"

1673
02:00:29.950 --> 02:00:31.990
"And spin..."

1674
02:00:35.150 --> 02:00:37.350
"Ignore what the world says"

1675
02:00:37.550 --> 02:00:39.430
"Salute yourself"

1676
02:00:39.550 --> 02:00:41.190
"And spin..."

1677
02:00:43.510 --> 02:00:46.310
"March in victory"

1678
02:00:46.750 --> 02:00:48.670
"Script your victory"

1679
02:00:48.990 --> 02:00:50.990
"And dream higher"

1680
02:00:53.030 --> 02:00:54.990
"Stand tall"

1681
02:00:55.910 --> 02:00:57.830
"Stride strong"

1682
02:00:58.190 --> 02:01:00.430
"Towards your goal"

1683
02:01:01.790 --> 02:01:04.750
"Spin, spin, spin
Spin like a Ghoomer"


1684
02:01:07.430 --> 02:01:09.790
"Spin your fate around"

1685
02:01:11.070 --> 02:01:13.710
"May this crazy world
dance to your tune"


1686
02:01:14.110 --> 02:01:16.390
"As you spin like a Ghoomer..."

1687
02:01:16.670 --> 02:01:18.510
"And spin your fate around"

1688
02:01:20.670 --> 02:01:23.030
"Spin, spin, spin"

1689
02:01:23.510 --> 02:01:26.230
"Spin like a Ghoomer"

1690
02:01:30.550 --> 02:01:33.230
"Spin, spin, spin"

1691
02:01:33.670 --> 02:01:35.830
"Spin like a Ghoomer"

1692
02:01:58.030 --> 02:01:59.230
Rasika...

1693
02:02:00.950 --> 02:02:03.150
dial 100...

1694
02:02:04.910 --> 02:02:06.670
Call the police.

1695
02:02:07.950 --> 02:02:12.110
Doing something wrong
and running off to prison is normal.


1696
02:02:12.950 --> 02:02:16.310
Correcting the wrong
and then going to prison is...


1697
02:02:18.470 --> 02:02:19.590
Ghoomer.

1698
02:02:21.310 --> 02:02:22.950
Call the police.

1699
02:03:06.550 --> 02:03:07.630
Say it.

1700
02:03:09.030 --> 02:03:10.230
Sorry.

1701
02:03:16.550 --> 02:03:17.790
Say it...

1702
02:03:19.630 --> 02:03:21.750
Very sorry.

1703
02:03:23.710 --> 02:03:24.990
Say it...

1704
02:03:26.110 --> 02:03:26.670
Say it...

1705
02:03:26.790 --> 02:03:28.150
I said I'm sorry.

1706
02:03:29.030 --> 02:03:32.310
"Etch this in your soul"

1707
02:03:38.270 --> 02:03:41.510
"Fulfil every dream"

1708
02:03:47.710 --> 02:03:49.710
"You are light"

1709
02:03:50.110 --> 02:03:52.070
"You are fire"

1710
02:03:52.470 --> 02:03:54.870
"You are the chosen one"
