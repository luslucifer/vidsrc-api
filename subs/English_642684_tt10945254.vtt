00:01:03.787 --> 00:01:05.247
Hello.

2
00:01:08.875 --> 00:01:10.377
Hello, Mr. Hakim.

3
00:01:14.423 --> 00:01:15.507
Hello, Mrs. Leroux.

4
00:01:15.674 --> 00:01:17.050
Hello, Mr. Hakim.

5
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.448
Mr. Ben Mrad.

6
00:01:39.614 --> 00:01:40.615
Mr. Hakim!

7
00:01:40.782 --> 00:01:42.200
- How's things?
- Great.


8
00:01:42.367 --> 00:01:43.869
Are the kids hassling you?

9
00:01:44.036 --> 00:01:46.997
Not since you talked to them.
Thanks, Mr. Hakim.


10
00:01:47.164 --> 00:01:49.207
- We're lucky to have you.
- Oh, no.


11
00:01:49.374 --> 00:01:51.585
I'm just doing my job, you know.

12
00:01:51.752 --> 00:01:54.254
Calling all units.
Holdup in the sector!


13
00:01:54.421 --> 00:01:55.714
26 Missonnier Street.

14
00:01:59.092 --> 00:02:00.092
Police!

15
00:02:00.177 --> 00:02:01.803
Holdup on Missonnier Street!

16
00:02:02.596 --> 00:02:04.931
Police! Holdup on Missonnier Street!

17
00:02:10.228 --> 00:02:12.230
Hakim to headquarters. I see them!

18
00:02:12.856 --> 00:02:14.566
Hakim! This is your captain.

19
00:02:15.275 --> 00:02:17.444
Do not intervene, Hakim.

20
00:02:18.236 --> 00:02:19.780
Hide. That's an order!

21
00:02:24.326 --> 00:02:26.244
I have eyes on them.

22
00:02:26.411 --> 00:02:27.454
Hakim?

23
00:02:28.747 --> 00:02:29.747
Hakim!

24
00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:31.625
They're leaving.

25
00:02:31.792 --> 00:02:32.876
What do I do?

26
00:02:34.252 --> 00:02:35.252
Screw it.

27
00:02:35.504 --> 00:02:37.047
Police! Don't move!

28
00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:40.299
Idiot!

29
00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.289
The handle's frozen.

30
00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:22.843
I'm gonna pee on the handle.

31
00:03:27.681 --> 00:03:29.016
Come on, Hakim.

32
00:03:46.992 --> 00:03:47.992
Don't open!

33
00:03:56.585 --> 00:03:58.170
Move aside!

34
00:03:58.462 --> 00:03:59.462
You in pain?

35
00:03:59.504 --> 00:04:00.589
Yes, a little.

36
00:04:00.756 --> 00:04:01.840
Yeah, me too.

37
00:04:02.466 --> 00:04:05.635
Because the chief of police
is asking how one of my men


38
00:04:05.802 --> 00:04:08.305
got his dick stuck to a truck door!

39
00:04:08.638 --> 00:04:10.891
Captain, what exactly happened?

40
00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.602
Get these journalists out of here!

41
00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:15.228
What are we waiting for?

42
00:04:15.562 --> 00:04:17.856
We need heat
to defrost it all at once.


43
00:04:18.272 --> 00:04:21.401
Let me through! 
I have a hairdryer.

44
00:04:21.568 --> 00:04:23.070
Let the hairdryer through.

45
00:04:44.341 --> 00:04:46.218
Police! Don't move.

46
00:04:46.385 --> 00:04:48.178
- What's brewing?
- A tajine.


47
00:04:48.345 --> 00:04:50.138
- What kind?
- Chicken.


48
00:04:50.305 --> 00:04:53.225
- With olives?
- Yes, my son's favorite.


49
00:04:55.268 --> 00:04:56.520
My darling son.

50
00:04:57.896 --> 00:04:59.064
Are they clean?

51
00:04:59.231 --> 00:05:01.692
Go wash your hands right now.

52
00:05:03.151 --> 00:05:04.945
- What's wrong?
- It stings.


53
00:05:05.112 --> 00:05:08.365
I told your dad
not to circumcise you by himself.


54
00:05:08.532 --> 00:05:10.909
He never listens. I'll call Dr. Truong.

55
00:05:35.559 --> 00:05:37.561
I can't. Shit, it hurts.

56
00:05:41.023 --> 00:05:41.857
Hakim.

57
00:05:42.024 --> 00:05:43.024
Yes?

58
00:05:46.111 --> 00:05:48.488
Mom, stop taking all that medication.

59
00:05:49.114 --> 00:05:50.490
I have bronchitis,

60
00:05:50.657 --> 00:05:53.118
I have arthritis, 
I have cellulite...

61
00:05:53.285 --> 00:05:54.619
Dr. Truong said,

62
00:05:54.786 --> 00:05:56.830
"Aïcha, eat less and exercise."

63
00:05:56.997 --> 00:05:59.916
He's right.
You should sign up at my gym.


64
00:06:01.209 --> 00:06:02.961
I chatted with the neighbor.

65
00:06:03.128 --> 00:06:06.006
They're hiring at the post office.

66
00:06:06.381 --> 00:06:09.051
They have good wages, vacation leave,

67
00:06:09.217 --> 00:06:10.635
and it's close to home.

68
00:06:10.802 --> 00:06:12.179
I'm a cop, not a postman.

69
00:06:12.346 --> 00:06:15.682
The police is killing me.
I have ulcers from head to toe.


70
00:06:15.849 --> 00:06:18.101
- Mom, stop.
- I know why you do this.


71
00:06:18.268 --> 00:06:20.228
To be like your father.

72
00:06:20.562 --> 00:06:22.731
See, Ahmed?
Even dead, you're a pain.


73
00:06:23.065 --> 00:06:24.191
That's enough!

74
00:06:24.358 --> 00:06:25.442
What do you want?

75
00:06:25.609 --> 00:06:29.529
To die like him on the job?
He wasn't even on duty that day!


76
00:06:29.821 --> 00:06:31.323
Maybe he'd be proud of me.

77
00:06:33.492 --> 00:06:34.326
Mom?

78
00:06:34.451 --> 00:06:37.287
I'm suffocating. 
My asthma spray.

79
00:06:53.929 --> 00:06:56.014
I know you'll abandon me.

80
00:06:56.848 --> 00:06:58.308
I'll die all alone.

81
00:06:58.475 --> 00:07:00.060
- I know I will.
- Mom.


82
00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:01.812
I'll never abandon you.

83
00:07:02.771 --> 00:07:03.939
Say "I swear."

84
00:07:04.106 --> 00:07:05.106
I swear.

85
00:07:05.148 --> 00:07:06.942
Say "I swear before God."

86
00:07:07.109 --> 00:07:08.819
I swear before God.

87
00:07:09.903 --> 00:07:11.530
I made pastries for you.

88
00:07:20.622 --> 00:07:21.999
Hello, Dr. Truong.

89
00:07:22.165 --> 00:07:24.376
- How nice to see you!
- It smells good.


90
00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:27.838
Let me guess. You made couscous?

91
00:07:28.005 --> 00:07:29.881
No, tajine.

92
00:07:30.048 --> 00:07:31.341
Oh, I see.

93
00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:34.219
So, what's the problem?

94
00:07:39.266 --> 00:07:40.517
What happened?

95
00:07:40.684 --> 00:07:43.395
It's a long story. 
Let's say a bad chill.

96
00:07:44.104 --> 00:07:46.356
I've never seen anything like this.

97
00:07:46.523 --> 00:07:48.483
It looks like a nitrogen burn.

98
00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:51.153
It looks like meat
that defrosted too fast.


99
00:07:51.653 --> 00:07:52.653
Mom, please.

100
00:07:52.779 --> 00:07:55.324
I'm your mother,
I know your weenie by heart.


101
00:07:57.242 --> 00:07:58.242
Does that hurt?

102
00:07:58.327 --> 00:07:59.578
Not at all.

103
00:07:59.745 --> 00:08:02.289
I haven't been able to pee since.

104
00:08:02.456 --> 00:08:05.083
- Barely a few drops.
- That's normal.


105
00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:08.795
When it felt the cold,
it got scared and retracted.


106
00:08:09.254 --> 00:08:11.340
Your bladder shut down the tubes.

107
00:08:11.673 --> 00:08:14.259
He'll be able to have children?

108
00:08:18.347 --> 00:08:19.348
Aïcha...

109
00:08:21.266 --> 00:08:22.434
Of course he will.

110
00:08:23.352 --> 00:08:24.936
Dr. Truong!

111
00:08:25.395 --> 00:08:26.980
- For you.
- What is it?


112
00:08:27.147 --> 00:08:29.358
Puff pastry filled with meat.

113
00:08:30.442 --> 00:08:31.652
Delicious.

114
00:08:32.986 --> 00:08:35.237
What's the scar right below?

115
00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:38.241
That's from the circumcision.
It got messy.


116
00:08:38.408 --> 00:08:40.702
Mom, please. I'm right here.

117
00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:43.205
It happens.

118
00:08:43.372 --> 00:08:45.916
POLICE STATION

119
00:09:03.141 --> 00:09:04.559
Do you know this man?

120
00:09:17.614 --> 00:09:19.533
- Hakim!
- Yes, captain?


121
00:09:20.117 --> 00:09:21.743
Gentlemen, sit down.

122
00:09:22.369 --> 00:09:24.246
Colonel Faillancier, head of Interpol.

123
00:09:25.163 --> 00:09:26.289
Here's the deal.

124
00:09:26.456 --> 00:09:29.001
We're onto
a bigtime cocaine trafficker.


125
00:09:29.167 --> 00:09:33.005
The Colombians
have started mixing coke in dry cement.


126
00:09:33.171 --> 00:09:36.675
It's undetectable
and can be transported


127
00:09:36.842 --> 00:09:38.552
- totally incognito.
- Smart guys.


128
00:09:41.555 --> 00:09:43.765
We don't care about the Colombians.

129
00:09:43.932 --> 00:09:46.518
We want the bosses in France
who push the drug.


130
00:09:46.893 --> 00:09:50.647
Our agents in Colombia
placed GPS trackers on cement bags.


131
00:09:50.814 --> 00:09:52.899
They arrived at this worksite,

132
00:09:53.066 --> 00:09:54.735
where the signals stopped.

133
00:09:54.901 --> 00:09:56.361
The De Almeida family,

134
00:09:56.528 --> 00:09:59.781
whom we suspect
of running this huge organization.


135
00:10:00.407 --> 00:10:02.868
- The a.c. is on.
- No, I don't think so.


136
00:10:03.035 --> 00:10:04.870
Yes, it is. I know because...

137
00:10:06.705 --> 00:10:07.705
I wheeze.

138
00:10:07.789 --> 00:10:08.789
See?

139
00:10:08.915 --> 00:10:10.417
- Asthma spray.
- I forgot it.


140
00:10:11.209 --> 00:10:13.295
I have some, my mom's like you.

141
00:10:13.462 --> 00:10:15.672
She has a senior position too?

142
00:10:15.839 --> 00:10:17.424
No, she's always sick.

143
00:10:18.717 --> 00:10:20.093
Or occasionally.

144
00:10:21.345 --> 00:10:23.055
She uses it under her arms.

145
00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:26.016
Carrying on.

146
00:10:26.183 --> 00:10:28.143
The family has two members.

147
00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:29.936
The daughter, Julia.

148
00:10:30.103 --> 00:10:31.188
The father, José.

149
00:10:31.355 --> 00:10:33.690
Hospitalized after a gangland dispute.

150
00:10:33.857 --> 00:10:34.983
The mother is dead.

151
00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:37.444
Our wiretaps revealed that the family

152
00:10:37.611 --> 00:10:38.611
is bringing in

153
00:10:38.695 --> 00:10:40.364
a distant cousin from Ansiães.

154
00:10:42.783 --> 00:10:45.243
Whatever.
A godforsaken place in Portugal.


155
00:10:45.661 --> 00:10:47.621
By chance, they've never seen him.

156
00:10:47.788 --> 00:10:51.291
He spends summers
as a voluntary fireman putting out fires.


157
00:10:51.458 --> 00:10:52.458
This cousin...

158
00:10:52.584 --> 00:10:54.378
is him: Joaquim.

159
00:10:58.965 --> 00:11:01.426
He looks like me
dressed as a Gipsy King.


160
00:11:02.177 --> 00:11:03.011
Tell me

161
00:11:03.095 --> 00:11:04.596
you're not thinking that.

162
00:11:04.763 --> 00:11:06.014
- Yes.
- No.


163
00:11:07.307 --> 00:11:10.852
Yes. We searched the police's files.
He's the closest match.


164
00:11:11.019 --> 00:11:12.771
Patrolman Hakim Dhouieb

165
00:11:12.896 --> 00:11:15.023
will infiltrate the De Almeidas.

166
00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:16.400
Me, infiltrate?

167
00:11:16.566 --> 00:11:19.528
We have six days
to make you into a real Portuguese.


168
00:11:20.696 --> 00:11:23.448
Okay, then. Gentlemen, ma'am.

169
00:11:23.615 --> 00:11:24.783
It was a pleasure.

170
00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:26.535
I'll leave you to it.

171
00:11:26.952 --> 00:11:28.787
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, sir.


172
00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:29.788
Sit down.

173
00:11:29.871 --> 00:11:32.332
It's fantastic, you deserve it.

174
00:11:33.125 --> 00:11:34.167
Sit!

175
00:11:35.043 --> 00:11:37.212
He's your man, you're in charge.

176
00:11:37.379 --> 00:11:38.839
You will liaise between.

177
00:11:39.006 --> 00:11:40.132
Hakim and us.

178
00:11:40.298 --> 00:11:41.466
Please, not that.

179
00:11:41.633 --> 00:11:42.843
He fails, so do you.

180
00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:46.138
Turn the worksite
and their home upside down,


181
00:11:46.304 --> 00:11:47.639
I want the drugs.

182
00:11:47.806 --> 00:11:49.850
France is counting on you.

183
00:11:50.017 --> 00:11:51.310
Excuse me.

184
00:11:51.476 --> 00:11:53.729
- What's the mission name?
- How's that?


185
00:11:53.895 --> 00:11:55.314
Its code name.

186
00:11:56.273 --> 00:11:58.442
Who cares. Call it what you want.

187
00:11:58.567 --> 00:12:00.527
"Operation Portugal."

188
00:12:00.694 --> 00:12:03.822
"Operation" for operation.
"Portugal" for the Portuguese.


189
00:12:03.989 --> 00:12:05.741
"Operation Portugal."

190
00:12:13.665 --> 00:12:15.083
I should've been a chef.

191
00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:17.002
I'll be working for Interpol.

192
00:12:17.586 --> 00:12:19.296
This will be pure hell.

193
00:12:44.655 --> 00:12:46.490
You'll be proud of me, Dad.

194
00:12:57.250 --> 00:12:58.835
What's that suitcase?

195
00:12:59.002 --> 00:13:01.254
It was Dad's
when he left on mission.


196
00:13:08.553 --> 00:13:11.765
Agents Baumard and Chabin
will follow you day and night.


197
00:13:14.476 --> 00:13:17.396
We brought in our best Portuguese agent.

198
00:13:17.562 --> 00:13:19.106
Agent Gonçalves.

199
00:13:21.441 --> 00:13:22.693
The best.

200
00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:46.591
- What you name?
- Excuse me?


201
00:13:47.134 --> 00:13:49.136
What you name?

202
00:13:49.469 --> 00:13:52.389
Patrolman Hakim Dhouieb
from Epinay-sur-Seine.


203
00:13:53.598 --> 00:13:55.225
What's that ugly suitcase?

204
00:13:55.392 --> 00:13:56.852
It was my dad's.

205
00:13:57.561 --> 00:13:58.979
You wanna be Portuguese?

206
00:13:59.146 --> 00:14:01.440
I need to infiltrate a worksite...

207
00:14:01.606 --> 00:14:02.983
Shut up.

208
00:14:03.775 --> 00:14:05.736
You name no Hakim.

209
00:14:06.403 --> 00:14:08.572
You name, "Jou-you-quim."

210
00:14:08.739 --> 00:14:09.823
Okay?

211
00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:11.408
- Okay, okay?
- Yes.


212
00:14:11.575 --> 00:14:13.035
This won't be easy.

213
00:14:13.201 --> 00:14:15.037
No, this won't be easy.

214
00:14:15.203 --> 00:14:16.203
Not easy.

215
00:14:16.246 --> 00:14:19.291
I'm going to make you
into a real Portuguese.


216
00:14:22.419 --> 00:14:25.547
This is pastéis de nata.

217
00:14:25.714 --> 00:14:27.257
Delicately.

218
00:14:28.967 --> 00:14:30.344
Taste.

219
00:14:37.309 --> 00:14:38.309
Nice?

220
00:14:38.435 --> 00:14:39.811
Custard tart.

221
00:14:39.895 --> 00:14:42.105
No, not custard tart.

222
00:14:42.648 --> 00:14:44.650
It's a pastel de nata.

223
00:14:46.735 --> 00:14:47.569
Custard.

224
00:14:47.736 --> 00:14:50.822
No, it's not the same.
It's not custard.


225
00:14:50.989 --> 00:14:53.742
It's a pastel de nata.

226
00:14:54.117 --> 00:14:55.494
Yeah, it's a...

227
00:14:56.078 --> 00:14:57.663
mini custard...

228
00:14:57.829 --> 00:14:59.289
It's not custard!

229
00:14:59.456 --> 00:15:00.707
It's pastel de nata!

230
00:15:00.874 --> 00:15:03.669
A 200-year-old recipe!
It's a national treasure.


231
00:15:03.835 --> 00:15:05.003
Not mini custard!

232
00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:06.797
Okay, 50 knee squats.

233
00:15:10.175 --> 00:15:12.135
It's your hometown, say it right!

234
00:15:15.055 --> 00:15:16.098
That's shit.

235
00:15:16.264 --> 00:15:18.392
Come on, I said!

236
00:15:18.558 --> 00:15:20.060
- Say "thank you."
- Obrigada.


237
00:15:20.227 --> 00:15:22.354
Obrigado! You're not a girl.

238
00:15:22.521 --> 00:15:23.355
Not a girl.

239
00:15:23.438 --> 00:15:24.439
50 more "squatch."

240
00:15:24.606 --> 00:15:25.649
Squash?

241
00:15:25.816 --> 00:15:26.900
50 more "squatch."

242
00:15:27.359 --> 00:15:28.652
I'll go get my racket.

243
00:15:29.319 --> 00:15:30.779
He's a total moron.

244
00:15:31.697 --> 00:15:32.823
He's a moron.

245
00:15:34.866 --> 00:15:37.452
- Portugal! Portugal!
- Stop, stop.


246
00:15:37.869 --> 00:15:38.869
"Pour-tou-gal."

247
00:15:40.414 --> 00:15:42.082
Not Portugal. "Pour-tou-gal."

248
00:15:43.375 --> 00:15:46.169
Harder! What do Portuguese do
on Sunday mornings?


249
00:15:46.336 --> 00:15:48.714
- Go to church.
- First they light the BBQ.


250
00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:50.716
So the embers will be ready.

251
00:15:52.509 --> 00:15:54.219
- What's this?
- A helicopter.


252
00:15:54.386 --> 00:15:56.138
No, a "houloucouptere."

253
00:15:58.473 --> 00:16:00.100
Hurrah, good job!

254
00:16:00.267 --> 00:16:02.269
- The best fish in the world?
- Cod.


255
00:16:02.436 --> 00:16:04.688
Bacalhau! Come on!

256
00:16:05.689 --> 00:16:06.815
Magellan.

257
00:16:07.024 --> 00:16:07.858
Explorer.

258
00:16:07.983 --> 00:16:09.109
Cristiano Ronaldo.

259
00:16:09.276 --> 00:16:10.152
Soccer player.

260
00:16:10.235 --> 00:16:11.235
That's enough.

261
00:16:11.903 --> 00:16:13.363
Goalie?

262
00:16:21.621 --> 00:16:23.290
To arms,

263
00:16:24.166 --> 00:16:25.751
to arms!

264
00:16:26.877 --> 00:16:29.796
Over the land, over the sea!

265
00:16:30.672 --> 00:16:32.049
"To arms" is easy.

266
00:16:32.716 --> 00:16:35.135
It's the "over the sea" I don't get.

267
00:16:35.302 --> 00:16:36.720
We have a problem.

268
00:16:36.887 --> 00:16:39.056
He's arriving sooner by car.

269
00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:42.684
Gentlemen.

270
00:16:42.851 --> 00:16:45.062
Change in plans,
you leave in one hour.


271
00:16:45.228 --> 00:16:47.648
I can't be ready in one hour.

272
00:16:48.023 --> 00:16:49.232
Look me in eyes.

273
00:16:49.816 --> 00:16:50.942
In the eyes.

274
00:16:51.276 --> 00:16:52.653
In the eyes.

275
00:16:53.278 --> 00:16:54.278
Listen to me.

276
00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:56.615
Playing Portuguese is over.

277
00:16:58.533 --> 00:16:59.701
You are Portuguese.

278
00:17:05.498 --> 00:17:06.499
I'll be the best.

279
00:17:06.667 --> 00:17:08.377
The best Portuguese guy ever.

280
00:17:08.543 --> 00:17:10.045
You'll be proud of me!

281
00:17:10.211 --> 00:17:11.380
I am proud of you.

282
00:17:11.921 --> 00:17:13.256
You have no accent?

283
00:17:15.007 --> 00:17:16.593
No. I mean, yes.

284
00:17:16.759 --> 00:17:18.428
Here's the thing...

285
00:17:18.719 --> 00:17:21.305
It's my parents who immigrated.

286
00:17:21.473 --> 00:17:23.182
I'm the second generation.

287
00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:25.142
I grew up in the suburbs.

288
00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:27.270
I did that to train you.

289
00:17:27.437 --> 00:17:30.565
I have to say,
I had a great time with you.


290
00:17:30.732 --> 00:17:32.609
It's a first in my career.

291
00:17:33.986 --> 00:17:36.571
I don't usually kiss, but for you...

292
00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:39.616
Força, as we say.

293
00:17:41.576 --> 00:17:42.995
Chin up, soldier.

294
00:17:43.203 --> 00:17:44.454
Long live France.

295
00:17:44.705 --> 00:17:45.831
Long live Portugal.

296
00:17:46.456 --> 00:17:48.125
I'm gonna go because...

297
00:17:48.291 --> 00:17:50.043
I hate goodbyes.

298
00:17:51.712 --> 00:17:53.213
All I can say is obrigado.

299
00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:55.298
Obrigada, obrigado.

300
00:17:56.341 --> 00:17:57.843
And "houloucouptere."

301
00:18:07.519 --> 00:18:09.187
Now we have something.

302
00:18:09.354 --> 00:18:11.106
- You sure?
- Yes.


303
00:18:29.041 --> 00:18:30.500
- Joaquim Da Silva?
- Yes.


304
00:18:30.959 --> 00:18:32.169
Get out of the car.

305
00:18:32.461 --> 00:18:33.587
Turn around.

306
00:18:36.048 --> 00:18:37.257
I don't speak French!

307
00:18:37.674 --> 00:18:39.801
He drove all that
way in a Renault 5?

308
00:18:39.968 --> 00:18:42.179
- You're under arrest.
- What for?


309
00:18:43.764 --> 00:18:44.765
What for?

310
00:18:47.601 --> 00:18:49.019
Sausage trafficking!

311
00:18:49.186 --> 00:18:50.270
I don't speak French!

312
00:19:17.798 --> 00:19:19.091
I won't let you down.

313
00:19:19.257 --> 00:19:21.051
Operation Portugal.

314
00:19:45.909 --> 00:19:47.035
He'll never manage.

315
00:19:47.202 --> 00:19:48.202
What?

316
00:19:48.495 --> 00:19:49.579
Nothing.

317
00:20:15.355 --> 00:20:17.399
Hello, Joaquim, how are you?

318
00:20:17.566 --> 00:20:19.609
Fine. Everything's fine.

319
00:20:19.776 --> 00:20:20.819
Good trip?

320
00:20:22.446 --> 00:20:25.490
First off,
I came to France to speak French.


321
00:20:25.657 --> 00:20:28.201
I speak Portuguese all year long.

322
00:20:30.162 --> 00:20:31.162
Okay...

323
00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:34.791
Let's say hi to Dad.

324
00:20:34.958 --> 00:20:36.585
Of course. Obrigado.

325
00:20:36.752 --> 00:20:39.129
France is a nice place.
I like it a lot.


326
00:21:01.652 --> 00:21:02.861
Who's she?

327
00:21:03.695 --> 00:21:05.280
Avó Lena, my grandmother.

328
00:21:05.447 --> 00:21:08.283
Oh, yeah. She wasn't in my files.

329
00:21:12.329 --> 00:21:14.498
He's counting on you at the site.

330
00:21:16.041 --> 00:21:17.834
Yes, of course.

331
00:21:18.001 --> 00:21:19.586
Obrigado.

332
00:21:22.297 --> 00:21:24.049
We're way behind schedule.

333
00:21:24.966 --> 00:21:26.426
Yes, of course.

334
00:21:26.593 --> 00:21:27.803
Obrigado.

335
00:21:31.974 --> 00:21:34.059
Julia is too young to be in charge.

336
00:21:34.559 --> 00:21:35.811
And she's a girl.

337
00:21:39.815 --> 00:21:42.317
We should let him sleep.
He's sedated.


338
00:21:47.322 --> 00:21:48.824
Good night, Dad.

339
00:21:48.991 --> 00:21:50.242
Good night, Daddy.

340
00:21:54.830 --> 00:21:56.957
I don't think your grandma likes me.

341
00:21:57.124 --> 00:21:59.042
She's mistrustful, like me.

342
00:21:59.292 --> 00:22:00.669
Here's your room.

343
00:22:05.173 --> 00:22:06.299
There's no bed.

344
00:22:06.466 --> 00:22:09.678
Like you wanted.
"No bed or heating, like in Ansiães."


345
00:22:09.845 --> 00:22:12.764
There was no bed
or heating in this room?


346
00:22:12.931 --> 00:22:14.850
Sure, but we took it out.

347
00:22:15.017 --> 00:22:17.728
Right. Like I wanted.
"No bed or heating.


348
00:22:17.894 --> 00:22:19.229
Like in Ansiães."

349
00:22:19.438 --> 00:22:21.231
Okay, good night.

350
00:22:27.404 --> 00:22:29.531
I'm gonna die. 
I know I'll die.

351
00:22:32.034 --> 00:22:33.118
Jesus.

352
00:22:38.165 --> 00:22:39.666
Wake up, Joaquim!

353
00:22:49.551 --> 00:22:50.969
You, you and you.

354
00:22:51.136 --> 00:22:52.637
You others can try tomorrow.

355
00:22:53.513 --> 00:22:55.182
They're illegal workers.

356
00:22:55.307 --> 00:22:57.392
- You the police?
- No, I'm Portuguese.


357
00:22:57.559 --> 00:22:58.685
Not the police.

358
00:23:02.689 --> 00:23:04.650
Wow, this is some worksite.

359
00:23:05.359 --> 00:23:06.693
So, where do I start?

360
00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:09.071
Knock it off. You're the boss.

361
00:23:09.696 --> 00:23:11.698
The boss of the whole site?

362
00:23:11.865 --> 00:23:13.784
That's why we brought you here.

363
00:23:14.534 --> 00:23:15.911
Here. The boss's hat.

364
00:23:16.662 --> 00:23:17.871
Boss!

365
00:23:19.873 --> 00:23:21.792
- Hi, boss.
- What'd you say?


366
00:23:21.958 --> 00:23:23.585
- "Hi, boss."
- Say it again.


367
00:23:24.586 --> 00:23:25.420
Boss.

368
00:23:25.504 --> 00:23:26.504
Again.

369
00:23:27.381 --> 00:23:28.215
Boss?

370
00:23:28.298 --> 00:23:30.467
That's right, I'm the boss.

371
00:23:33.011 --> 00:23:35.597
Can we lay the power cables now?

372
00:23:40.018 --> 00:23:42.896
Yes, that's right.
Lay the power cables.


373
00:23:43.689 --> 00:23:44.689
Thanks, boss.

374
00:23:46.233 --> 00:23:47.609
Lay the cables, boys!

375
00:23:55.951 --> 00:23:57.661
We're not home yet.

376
00:23:58.537 --> 00:23:59.746
We'll die of boredom.

377
00:24:00.414 --> 00:24:02.165
Hope he finds the coke fast.

378
00:24:05.919 --> 00:24:08.588
- Hope he finds the coke fast.
- You bet.


379
00:24:20.392 --> 00:24:22.352
I'm tasting the quality

380
00:24:22.519 --> 00:24:23.854
and the texture.

381
00:24:24.062 --> 00:24:25.981
That's how we do it in Portugal.

382
00:24:26.189 --> 00:24:28.775
This one's nice,
maybe just a little flat.


383
00:24:29.026 --> 00:24:30.569
But it's a good year.

384
00:24:32.738 --> 00:24:34.197
Okay, I have work.

385
00:24:43.332 --> 00:24:45.042
- Boss.
- Yeah?


386
00:24:45.751 --> 00:24:47.002
We got a problem.

387
00:24:47.169 --> 00:24:49.629
The door can't go
next to the IPN beams.


388
00:24:49.796 --> 00:24:51.256
IPN beams are serious.

389
00:24:51.423 --> 00:24:53.050
No mistakes allowed.

390
00:24:53.508 --> 00:24:55.135
Because the IPNs...

391
00:24:55.677 --> 00:24:57.637
The blueprint is upside down.

392
00:24:58.013 --> 00:24:59.556
I know that.

393
00:24:59.723 --> 00:25:01.558
It was drawn upside down.

394
00:25:02.017 --> 00:25:03.727
No, just turn it around.

395
00:25:05.604 --> 00:25:06.604
I know my job.

396
00:25:06.730 --> 00:25:08.398
It was drawn upside down.

397
00:25:08.565 --> 00:25:10.901
You can't work
with backward blueprints.


398
00:25:11.068 --> 00:25:14.196
Everything's upside down here.
The site, the country...


399
00:25:14.363 --> 00:25:16.490
And my job
is to straighten things up.


400
00:25:16.657 --> 00:25:18.075
Have you got that?

401
00:25:19.993 --> 00:25:21.370
Where does the door go?

402
00:25:31.088 --> 00:25:32.088
There.

403
00:25:32.172 --> 00:25:34.508
It's good there. 
Directly opposite.

404
00:25:34.675 --> 00:25:36.927
Opposite what? 
It'll open onto nothing.

405
00:25:37.094 --> 00:25:38.929
Who's the boss here?

406
00:25:39.096 --> 00:25:40.097
You or me?

407
00:25:42.349 --> 00:25:43.350
What am I?

408
00:25:43.976 --> 00:25:44.976
The boss.

409
00:25:45.102 --> 00:25:46.436
That's right.

410
00:25:46.645 --> 00:25:47.645
Who am I?

411
00:25:49.606 --> 00:25:50.606
The boss.

412
00:25:51.233 --> 00:25:52.359
What am I?

413
00:25:55.195 --> 00:25:56.195
The boss.

414
00:25:57.948 --> 00:26:00.409
So stop drawing upside down blueprints.

415
00:26:00.575 --> 00:26:02.577
We'll never get done like this.

416
00:26:04.371 --> 00:26:06.248
It'll open onto empty space.

417
00:26:20.679 --> 00:26:21.847
It's hot.

418
00:26:24.224 --> 00:26:25.684
You're a sissy, Baumard.

419
00:26:26.351 --> 00:26:29.604
- I'm a sissy?
- Bet you can't drink it down.


420
00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:41.074
Coffee, Chabin?

421
00:26:41.199 --> 00:26:42.284
A double.

422
00:26:56.048 --> 00:26:58.550
Listen, I don't want to hear it!

423
00:26:58.717 --> 00:27:01.720
Delivery is scheduled for tomorrow,
end of story!


424
00:27:05.015 --> 00:27:06.141
It's coming.

425
00:27:09.186 --> 00:27:11.521
Open up! I haven't peed in a week!

426
00:27:11.688 --> 00:27:13.148
Get lost, it's occupied.

427
00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:33.585
- Is he...
- No, no.


428
00:27:34.586 --> 00:27:35.796
Don't say anything.

429
00:27:38.674 --> 00:27:40.133
It's for the cement.

430
00:27:40.384 --> 00:27:42.302
Like in Ansiães.

431
00:27:47.975 --> 00:27:49.184
Bet you can't.

432
00:28:06.868 --> 00:28:08.036
You're crying.

433
00:28:10.163 --> 00:28:10.998
No.

434
00:28:11.164 --> 00:28:12.249
Yes, you are.

435
00:28:12.416 --> 00:28:14.292
I got something in my eye.

436
00:28:15.210 --> 00:28:17.129
I scratched it with this thing.

437
00:28:24.219 --> 00:28:25.345
Wake up, Joaquim!

438
00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:30.392
Where's the coke, damn it!

439
00:28:30.475 --> 00:28:32.561
- We always did it this way.
- It's not my problem.


440
00:28:32.644 --> 00:28:34.146
I said, we need you!

441
00:28:34.604 --> 00:28:37.649
- What's going on?
- He won't work the cement mixer.


442
00:28:37.816 --> 00:28:40.152
I'm an electrician, not a builder.

443
00:28:40.319 --> 00:28:41.319
You shit!

444
00:28:41.528 --> 00:28:42.612
Claude, stop!

445
00:28:42.779 --> 00:28:45.407
Why should I?
Arabs never do what you ask!


446
00:28:45.532 --> 00:28:47.617
And all you do is give orders!

447
00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:49.161
Stop!

448
00:28:51.955 --> 00:28:52.998
Break it up!

449
00:28:53.165 --> 00:28:54.374
Let go of me, idiot!

450
00:28:54.833 --> 00:28:56.168
The idiot is your boss!

451
00:28:56.335 --> 00:28:57.335
So shut up!

452
00:28:57.419 --> 00:28:58.419
Shit!

453
00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:01.089
You speak Arabic?

454
00:29:11.475 --> 00:29:13.018
Yes, I speak Arabic.

455
00:29:13.185 --> 00:29:15.437
I worked one month in Marrakech.

456
00:29:16.772 --> 00:29:18.190
Arabic's easy.

457
00:29:18.523 --> 00:29:21.401
It's like Portuguese, only it's Arabic.

458
00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:23.070
He's got talent.

459
00:29:23.236 --> 00:29:25.947
Two years in Italy,
I could barely order pizza.


460
00:29:26.281 --> 00:29:29.117
My dad's not here,
but the rules are the same!


461
00:29:29.242 --> 00:29:31.703
There's a building to finish.
We need to


462
00:29:31.870 --> 00:29:34.373
work as a team... and make an effort.

463
00:29:37.918 --> 00:29:39.211
Sorry.

464
00:29:39.628 --> 00:29:40.628
Hakim?

465
00:29:41.004 --> 00:29:42.798
I'm suffocating.

466
00:29:42.964 --> 00:29:44.049
I can't breathe.

467
00:29:47.928 --> 00:29:48.928
There.

468
00:29:53.892 --> 00:29:54.977
Mom?

469
00:30:00.482 --> 00:30:02.526
- Stop it, Mom.
- So I'm still your mom?


470
00:30:02.693 --> 00:30:04.152
I'm still your mom?

471
00:30:04.319 --> 00:30:05.904
You don't answer the phone.

472
00:30:06.154 --> 00:30:07.614
You don't sleep at home.

473
00:30:07.781 --> 00:30:09.658
You only come when I'm sick.

474
00:30:09.825 --> 00:30:11.493
Well, I'm not sick!

475
00:30:12.077 --> 00:30:13.245
- A girlfriend?
- No.


476
00:30:13.328 --> 00:30:14.162
You're gay?

477
00:30:14.287 --> 00:30:15.122
No!

478
00:30:15.205 --> 00:30:16.205
So what's wrong?

479
00:30:16.581 --> 00:30:19.292
I'm on an important investigation,
so back off!


480
00:30:19.418 --> 00:30:20.544
Back off?

481
00:30:20.711 --> 00:30:21.711
Back off.

482
00:30:22.754 --> 00:30:25.424
Is that how you talk to me?
Your mother?


483
00:30:27.676 --> 00:30:29.302
Look me in the eye.

484
00:30:29.469 --> 00:30:31.888
Go wash your hands right now.

485
00:30:32.097 --> 00:30:34.182
Then you sit down and eat!

486
00:30:37.394 --> 00:30:39.187
It's a top-secret mission.

487
00:30:39.354 --> 00:30:43.108
Top-secret, my eye.
You don't keep secrets from your mother.


488
00:30:45.569 --> 00:30:47.237
- You expecting someone?
- No.


489
00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:49.990
Hello, ma'am. Is Hakim here?

490
00:30:50.157 --> 00:30:51.950
What do you want? Who are you?

491
00:30:52.117 --> 00:30:54.786
I'm his captain,
so get him for me and fast!


492
00:30:55.579 --> 00:30:57.873
And fast?
Is that how you talk to me?


493
00:30:58.165 --> 00:31:02.127
Look me in the eye.
Go wash your hands right now!


494
00:31:03.962 --> 00:31:05.589
Enjoy your meal.

495
00:31:06.131 --> 00:31:07.466
Thank you, ma'am.

496
00:31:12.137 --> 00:31:14.639
We have a mission
and you come home to eat.


497
00:31:14.765 --> 00:31:17.392
- She had an asthma attack.
- I don't care.


498
00:31:17.934 --> 00:31:19.353
Have you found anything?

499
00:31:19.519 --> 00:31:20.979
No coke, no money.

500
00:31:21.146 --> 00:31:24.024
They're smart.
But don't ease up on the pressure.


501
00:31:27.569 --> 00:31:29.071
Now, that's interesting.

502
00:31:29.655 --> 00:31:30.864
Pickled lemon?

503
00:31:31.573 --> 00:31:32.616
No idea.

504
00:31:33.241 --> 00:31:34.660
Yes, it's pickled.

505
00:31:34.951 --> 00:31:35.951
Anyway,

506
00:31:36.078 --> 00:31:38.205
keep close watch on Julia.

507
00:31:38.372 --> 00:31:40.499
Shadow her 24/7 and make her talk.

508
00:31:40.666 --> 00:31:41.666
How?

509
00:31:41.792 --> 00:31:43.168
How should I know?

510
00:31:43.335 --> 00:31:45.837
Become her confidant or seduce her.

511
00:31:46.338 --> 00:31:48.715
I can seduce her, captain?

512
00:31:49.466 --> 00:31:51.009
You ever seduced a woman?

513
00:31:54.221 --> 00:31:55.222
Yes.

514
00:31:55.639 --> 00:31:56.723
Go on.

515
00:31:56.974 --> 00:31:58.475
Show me your fiery eyes.

516
00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:02.729
No, wait.

517
00:32:02.896 --> 00:32:03.939
Look.

518
00:32:09.486 --> 00:32:10.486
Seduced?

519
00:32:11.613 --> 00:32:12.698
Good. Now you.

520
00:32:15.075 --> 00:32:16.535
Don't purse your lips.

521
00:32:16.702 --> 00:32:17.995
Your eyes...

522
00:32:18.578 --> 00:32:19.746
Open them wider.

523
00:32:19.913 --> 00:32:21.415
No, you look sick.

524
00:32:22.416 --> 00:32:24.167
We'll have to make do.

525
00:32:30.507 --> 00:32:32.092
What did I just eat?

526
00:32:32.259 --> 00:32:33.259
A chili pepper.

527
00:32:49.526 --> 00:32:50.527
Hello, Julia.

528
00:32:51.695 --> 00:32:53.113
Where were you, at lunch?

529
00:32:54.072 --> 00:32:56.325
I had a minor medical emergency.

530
00:32:56.491 --> 00:32:57.576
Asthma.

531
00:32:58.702 --> 00:32:59.828
Tell me, Julia.

532
00:32:59.995 --> 00:33:01.496
Don't you think it's hot?

533
00:33:02.622 --> 00:33:03.874
No, it's cool.

534
00:33:04.041 --> 00:33:07.586
It's cool, then hot.
Can't tell anymore with global warming.


535
00:33:07.753 --> 00:33:08.795
But me...

536
00:33:09.296 --> 00:33:10.797
I'm hot, Julia.

537
00:33:13.675 --> 00:33:16.011
Why are your eyes all screwed up?

538
00:33:17.262 --> 00:33:19.056
What? No, that's...

539
00:33:20.682 --> 00:33:22.893
It's conjunctivitis.

540
00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:24.561
My eyes screw up

541
00:33:24.770 --> 00:33:27.022
from the dust on the worksite.

542
00:33:27.189 --> 00:33:29.316
It makes your eyes sting.

543
00:33:29.483 --> 00:33:31.151
Then you squint.

544
00:33:36.573 --> 00:33:38.116
I'll get back to work.

545
00:33:38.283 --> 00:33:39.701
I think it's best.

546
00:33:47.834 --> 00:33:48.834
33.

547
00:33:49.169 --> 00:33:50.169
34.

548
00:33:50.629 --> 00:33:51.797
35.

549
00:33:52.214 --> 00:33:53.214
36.

550
00:33:53.465 --> 00:33:55.300
- How many did you do?
- 38.


551
00:33:55.467 --> 00:33:56.760
I'll beat your ass.

552
00:33:57.552 --> 00:33:59.012
And Roucariès?

553
00:33:59.554 --> 00:34:00.722
52.

554
00:34:01.848 --> 00:34:02.848
A living legend.

555
00:34:03.558 --> 00:34:04.810
38.

556
00:34:04.977 --> 00:34:05.977
39!

557
00:34:06.228 --> 00:34:08.187
You lost!
I'm going for Roucariès.


558
00:34:09.522 --> 00:34:10.857
40! 46!

559
00:34:11.024 --> 00:34:11.857
No, 42.

560
00:34:11.942 --> 00:34:13.484
We'll meet halfway: 44.

561
00:34:14.194 --> 00:34:15.194
It stings.

562
00:34:30.292 --> 00:34:31.502
Wow, that's a V8.

563
00:34:31.670 --> 00:34:32.879
4.8 liters, 400 HP.

564
00:34:35.257 --> 00:34:36.842
What a handsome guy.

565
00:34:41.430 --> 00:34:42.556
No, he isn't?

566
00:34:45.808 --> 00:34:46.893
Sure.

567
00:34:50.897 --> 00:34:52.316
He's got a gun!

568
00:34:52.774 --> 00:34:54.443
I'm tired of your excuses.

569
00:34:54.609 --> 00:34:57.321
One house should've been finished

570
00:35:04.036 --> 00:35:05.329
What did you do?

571
00:35:05.495 --> 00:35:06.705
He's the developer!

572
00:35:06.872 --> 00:35:08.040
He had a gun.

573
00:35:10.667 --> 00:35:11.667
Shit.

574
00:35:12.127 --> 00:35:13.545
It wasn't a gun.

575
00:35:14.463 --> 00:35:15.839
It's hand gel.

576
00:35:16.006 --> 00:35:17.049
Oh, my God.

577
00:35:17.924 --> 00:35:21.303
I thought it was a gun
and that he wanted to attack you.


578
00:35:26.808 --> 00:35:27.893
What happened?

579
00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:29.394
Did I fall?

580
00:35:29.811 --> 00:35:31.980
Yes, during your inspection.

581
00:35:32.105 --> 00:35:33.273
Right, guys?

582
00:35:34.483 --> 00:35:36.693
Like you were hit with a...

583
00:35:37.653 --> 00:35:39.029
You had a good fall.

584
00:35:39.112 --> 00:35:40.238
In glass wool.

585
00:35:40.405 --> 00:35:41.698
That too?

586
00:35:41.865 --> 00:35:43.700
That's no good, I'm allergic.

587
00:35:44.660 --> 00:35:45.661
Here.

588
00:35:45.952 --> 00:35:47.371
Late delivery penalties.

589
00:35:47.537 --> 00:35:50.082
Get moving, or you'll have more.

590
00:35:50.248 --> 00:35:53.085
We have six houses to build
and not one is up!


591
00:35:55.045 --> 00:35:56.630
I wasn't hit with a shovel?

592
00:35:56.797 --> 00:35:57.881
No!

593
00:35:58.048 --> 00:36:00.425
I heard "ping"
and everything went black.


594
00:36:00.592 --> 00:36:02.344
- Do you swear?
- Yes!


595
00:36:03.762 --> 00:36:04.888
I believe you.

596
00:36:15.649 --> 00:36:17.025
The exit's that way?

597
00:36:17.192 --> 00:36:18.318
Then say so!

598
00:36:22.906 --> 00:36:24.825
I'm sorry, Julia.

599
00:36:24.992 --> 00:36:25.992
Don't talk to me.

600
00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:28.912
Okay, day's over.

601
00:36:34.793 --> 00:36:36.628
I know why you're out of control.

602
00:36:37.671 --> 00:36:39.589
- You're homesick.
- No.


603
00:36:40.132 --> 00:36:40.966
Yes.

604
00:36:41.133 --> 00:36:42.133
Maybe.

605
00:36:49.683 --> 00:36:51.643
Good evening.
Tonight is the night


606
00:36:51.810 --> 00:36:53.895
you've been waiting four years for!

607
00:36:54.062 --> 00:36:56.440
I didn't make much,
Carlos didn't warn me.


608
00:36:57.107 --> 00:36:58.734
- Have some salami.
- I'm good.


609
00:36:58.900 --> 00:37:00.402
Have some salami!

610
00:37:02.988 --> 00:37:04.323
We're gonna lose.

611
00:37:08.702 --> 00:37:10.537
GO FRANCE!

612
00:37:13.290 --> 00:37:14.583
Has it started?

613
00:37:14.750 --> 00:37:15.834
Are they playing?

614
00:37:16.001 --> 00:37:17.210
Come on, Umtiti!

615
00:37:17.377 --> 00:37:18.670
N'Golo Kanté!

616
00:37:18.837 --> 00:37:21.381
- Who's Umtiti?
- He plays against...


617
00:37:21.548 --> 00:37:22.924
With us but against you.

618
00:37:23.091 --> 00:37:24.217
No, against us.

619
00:37:24.384 --> 00:37:26.011
That's it, he's against us.

620
00:37:26.178 --> 00:37:27.179
Go Portugal!

621
00:37:29.473 --> 00:37:30.974
No one beats Portugal.

622
00:37:31.141 --> 00:37:33.518
Don't need a World Cup to know that.

623
00:37:33.727 --> 00:37:36.021
There's no hope for shit.

624
00:37:41.943 --> 00:37:43.236
Come on, Giroud.

625
00:37:55.540 --> 00:37:57.709
I don't believe it! He's shit!

626
00:37:57.918 --> 00:37:58.918
Shit!

627
00:37:59.002 --> 00:38:01.171
On your feet, if you're Portuguese!

628
00:38:01.588 --> 00:38:03.507
On your feet, if you're Portuguese!

629
00:38:03.674 --> 00:38:05.550
On your feet, Joaquim.

630
00:38:05.717 --> 00:38:06.885
My knee hurts.

631
00:38:07.052 --> 00:38:08.052
Shit.

632
00:38:10.514 --> 00:38:12.349
Oh, sorry, sorry!

633
00:38:12.516 --> 00:38:15.811
- I'll turn this off.
- Yeah, so he can't bother us.


634
00:38:15.978 --> 00:38:16.978
Jackass.

635
00:38:17.813 --> 00:38:20.357
- It was this close.
- Ronaldo did it again.


636
00:38:28.615 --> 00:38:31.535
Portuguese Delicacies.

637
00:38:31.702 --> 00:38:32.995
1-0.

638
00:38:33.453 --> 00:38:34.705
But it's enough to win.

639
00:38:34.871 --> 00:38:36.164
Good salami, huh?

640
00:38:40.961 --> 00:38:42.129
We won!

641
00:38:44.756 --> 00:38:46.967
- Come sit with us, Julia.
- No.


642
00:38:47.134 --> 00:38:48.385
Come on.

643
00:38:48.552 --> 00:38:50.679
I'm not in the mood. 
Leave me alone.

644
00:38:55.851 --> 00:38:58.061
Joaquim,
I was against you coming.


645
00:38:58.228 --> 00:39:00.105
I could've supervised the site.

646
00:39:00.272 --> 00:39:03.734
I'm up every day at 5:00 a.m.
I know my job inside out.


647
00:39:04.609 --> 00:39:06.320
I should've been the boss.

648
00:39:08.989 --> 00:39:10.032
It's coming.

649
00:39:10.198 --> 00:39:11.950
- What?
- The baby.


650
00:39:18.832 --> 00:39:21.543
- Call the fire department!
- It's too late.


651
00:39:21.710 --> 00:39:24.296
- Why are you looking at me?
- You're a bombeiro.


652
00:39:24.463 --> 00:39:26.089
- "Bombe" what?
- Bombeiro!


653
00:39:26.256 --> 00:39:27.632
You're a fireman.

654
00:39:27.799 --> 00:39:29.134
- Oh, no. No way.
- Yes!


655
00:39:29.301 --> 00:39:31.303
Fernando, no. Stop right there.

656
00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:33.347
Stop? You're a fireman!

657
00:39:33.513 --> 00:39:37.225
I take care of fires,
floods and tsunamis... Not that!


658
00:39:37.643 --> 00:39:39.436
Deliver my baby, damn it!

659
00:39:39.603 --> 00:39:40.937
Let her breathe.

660
00:39:41.104 --> 00:39:42.356
It'll be fine.

661
00:39:42.731 --> 00:39:44.816
Watch out for the table! Get a mop!

662
00:39:44.900 --> 00:39:47.569
Everything will be fine.

663
00:39:50.906 --> 00:39:52.366
What are you doing, boss?

664
00:39:52.449 --> 00:39:53.283
Breathing.

665
00:39:53.450 --> 00:39:55.327
- Not her?
- Yes, but me too.


666
00:39:56.036 --> 00:39:58.205
No worries, I'm the bombeiro.

667
00:39:59.081 --> 00:40:00.207
Keep going!

668
00:40:05.295 --> 00:40:06.380
What?

669
00:40:07.464 --> 00:40:08.465
Oh, my God.

670
00:40:08.632 --> 00:40:10.509
- A problem?
- No, not at all.


671
00:40:10.676 --> 00:40:12.094
Get that baby out!

672
00:40:12.427 --> 00:40:13.762
Okay, I'm ready.

673
00:40:13.929 --> 00:40:15.138
Breathe!

674
00:40:15.305 --> 00:40:16.305
Breathe!

675
00:40:17.975 --> 00:40:19.518
Not you, her!

676
00:40:21.436 --> 00:40:23.021
He's just hyperventilating.

677
00:40:23.188 --> 00:40:25.273
- Take care of me!
- Let's go.


678
00:40:26.441 --> 00:40:28.443
Push, block, push!

679
00:40:30.028 --> 00:40:31.071
It hurts!

680
00:40:31.238 --> 00:40:32.739
Push, block!

681
00:40:32.906 --> 00:40:34.032
We'll never make it.

682
00:40:34.199 --> 00:40:35.951
Shut your face!

683
00:40:36.159 --> 00:40:37.995
- She's not herself.
- Shut up!


684
00:40:38.161 --> 00:40:39.621
It hurts!

685
00:40:47.170 --> 00:40:48.005
Don't worry.

686
00:40:48.088 --> 00:40:49.172
Me too.

687
00:40:55.137 --> 00:40:56.263
Come on, Madalena.

688
00:40:56.430 --> 00:40:57.639
Block, push.

689
00:40:57.973 --> 00:40:58.807
Push!

690
00:40:58.974 --> 00:41:00.309
- Push!
- I can't!


691
00:41:02.185 --> 00:41:03.520
Look me in the eyes.

692
00:41:03.687 --> 00:41:05.355
No, in the eyes.

693
00:41:05.522 --> 00:41:08.442
We're gonna get the baby out.
But I need your trust.


694
00:41:08.608 --> 00:41:09.443
Okay?

695
00:41:09.526 --> 00:41:11.069
- Okay, okay?
- Yes!


696
00:41:11.236 --> 00:41:12.571
Guys, I need your help.

697
00:41:12.738 --> 00:41:16.116
Do anything, but motivate her!
All together, let's go!


698
00:41:18.535 --> 00:41:20.912
Let's go, Portugal!

699
00:41:23.332 --> 00:41:24.833
Let's go, Portugal!

700
00:41:33.175 --> 00:41:34.801
The head is coming!

701
00:41:37.763 --> 00:41:39.639
We're almost there! Louder!

702
00:41:43.602 --> 00:41:46.063
It's coming. Good work, Madalena.

703
00:41:46.647 --> 00:41:48.106
That's it!

704
00:41:48.273 --> 00:41:49.983
That's it, here he is.

705
00:41:54.613 --> 00:41:56.198
It's a boy.

706
00:41:59.576 --> 00:42:00.702
Thank you.

707
00:42:00.869 --> 00:42:01.870
Congratulations.

708
00:42:02.037 --> 00:42:03.497
We'll name him Joaquim.

709
00:42:03.664 --> 00:42:04.664
Nice name.

710
00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:05.791
Thanks.

711
00:42:10.587 --> 00:42:12.464
Give me a hug, guys.

712
00:42:33.443 --> 00:42:35.404
Julia, we'll make up the time.

713
00:42:35.570 --> 00:42:37.948
Guys, let's do it double quick.

714
00:42:44.037 --> 00:42:45.037
Good tea?

715
00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:46.289
Yeah, not bad.

716
00:42:46.456 --> 00:42:48.125
You're drinking hot water.

717
00:42:56.925 --> 00:42:57.759
Hi there.

718
00:42:57.926 --> 00:42:59.386
- Having fun?
- You scared me!


719
00:42:59.553 --> 00:43:02.180
Is this a cocaine mission
or a love boat?


720
00:43:02.347 --> 00:43:06.018
- Why are you here?
- Faillancier is putting on the heat.


721
00:43:06.435 --> 00:43:08.854
- She wants proof, and now.
- What can I do?


722
00:43:09.313 --> 00:43:12.357
Think! For starters,
go nose around the office.


723
00:43:12.524 --> 00:43:14.192
It's empty. Action!

724
00:43:14.359 --> 00:43:16.236
- Yes, captain!
- Don't call me that!


725
00:43:16.403 --> 00:43:18.071
I'm sorry, captain.

726
00:43:20.741 --> 00:43:22.159
Hey, Baldy!

727
00:43:22.492 --> 00:43:24.494
Take the wheelbarrow over there.

728
00:43:26.371 --> 00:43:27.539
I'm coming.

729
00:43:48.226 --> 00:43:50.270
Hello, Mom. I can't talk now.

730
00:43:50.812 --> 00:43:53.565
I haven't heard from you in ages.

731
00:43:53.732 --> 00:43:55.859
I'm worried, and in my state...

732
00:43:56.026 --> 00:43:58.111
- What state?
- My back.


733
00:43:58.737 --> 00:44:00.864
I'm sure it's lumbago cancer.

734
00:44:01.031 --> 00:44:03.492
I haven't had an exam in two months.

735
00:44:04.076 --> 00:44:04.910
Hakim,

736
00:44:05.077 --> 00:44:07.037
please come home. 
I made pastries.

737
00:44:07.204 --> 00:44:08.830
I'll call you back.

738
00:44:11.249 --> 00:44:12.834
I've lost my touch.

739
00:44:14.461 --> 00:44:16.838
He delivered the baby all alone.

740
00:44:17.005 --> 00:44:17.839
He was heroic.

741
00:44:17.964 --> 00:44:21.468
Carlos, I'm snowed under.
Can we talk about this later?


742
00:44:21.968 --> 00:44:25.889
It's not his fault. He just took the job
your dad offered him.


743
00:44:26.932 --> 00:44:28.183
We're like family.

744
00:44:28.350 --> 00:44:29.851
We grew up together.

745
00:44:30.227 --> 00:44:31.520
Can I be frank?

746
00:44:33.105 --> 00:44:34.606
I don't recognize you.

747
00:44:34.773 --> 00:44:37.150
Nothing interests you but work.

748
00:44:37.317 --> 00:44:39.361
It's been tough since your mom died.

749
00:44:39.528 --> 00:44:41.363
But she'd hate to see you so sad.

750
00:44:41.989 --> 00:44:43.240
You're right.

751
00:44:43.740 --> 00:44:44.908
I'll try to relax.

752
00:45:00.215 --> 00:45:03.010
I miss you so much,
I love you.


753
00:45:06.763 --> 00:45:09.224
- That wasn't my dad's pocket?
- Yes.


754
00:45:10.142 --> 00:45:11.643
- No.
- Yes.


755
00:45:13.228 --> 00:45:15.981
Your dad's a man.
We all need the same thing.


756
00:45:18.358 --> 00:45:19.651
I meant love.

757
00:45:25.365 --> 00:45:26.783
Not a word to anyone.

758
00:45:33.165 --> 00:45:36.918
Challans duck breast
with reduced red wine sauce...


759
00:45:37.502 --> 00:45:38.837
Me Kraczyk.

760
00:45:39.379 --> 00:45:40.672
Kraczyk me.

761
00:45:41.298 --> 00:45:42.507
Me Polak.

762
00:45:46.178 --> 00:45:48.055
I'm starving. What's for lunch?

763
00:45:48.221 --> 00:45:50.140
Pig's trotters. 
It's ready, boss.

764
00:45:50.307 --> 00:45:52.351
Nah, I've got a stitch in the side.

765
00:46:03.403 --> 00:46:06.156
- Want to taste?
- No, I only eat pork.


766
00:46:06.323 --> 00:46:08.200
We Portuguese only eat pork.

767
00:46:08.700 --> 00:46:09.785
You sure?

768
00:46:09.951 --> 00:46:11.870
To make you happy, Mohamed.

769
00:46:12.537 --> 00:46:14.539
Only to make you happy.

770
00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:19.960
This is no good.

771
00:46:20.087 --> 00:46:21.296
Really no good.

772
00:46:23.298 --> 00:46:24.549
No good at all!

773
00:46:24.716 --> 00:46:26.718
It's worse than pork.

774
00:46:27.344 --> 00:46:28.929
Some more, please.

775
00:46:29.388 --> 00:46:30.514
Here.

776
00:46:34.184 --> 00:46:35.644
It's really no good.

777
00:46:35.811 --> 00:46:37.771
I'm tasting to make you happy.

778
00:46:37.938 --> 00:46:39.064
You Arabs.

779
00:46:39.231 --> 00:46:40.774
- What's that?
- Pastries.


780
00:46:40.941 --> 00:46:43.318
I'll taste.
Even if it's not good.


781
00:46:43.694 --> 00:46:45.278
- What's it called?
- Chebakia.


782
00:46:45.445 --> 00:46:46.738
Chebakia.

783
00:46:47.239 --> 00:46:48.615
I've had this before.

784
00:46:51.868 --> 00:46:53.662
No good. No good at all.

785
00:46:53.829 --> 00:46:55.789
- Who made this bad pastry?
- My wife.


786
00:46:55.956 --> 00:46:57.332
Tell your wife...

787
00:46:57.874 --> 00:46:59.918
that this... is really no good.

788
00:47:00.085 --> 00:47:01.086
But good job!

789
00:47:08.844 --> 00:47:12.472
What a great guy.
He didn't like it, but he ate everything.


790
00:47:32.409 --> 00:47:33.702
You okay, boss?

791
00:47:34.828 --> 00:47:36.079
That's the toilets.

792
00:47:37.331 --> 00:47:40.083
I know,
I'm making holes in the toilets.


793
00:47:40.292 --> 00:47:42.419
When you take a poo, it stinks.

794
00:47:43.128 --> 00:47:44.963
- Yeah.
- So you need holes.


795
00:47:45.380 --> 00:47:46.631
For fresh air.

796
00:47:46.798 --> 00:47:49.426
I want holes everywhere,
like Swiss cheese.


797
00:47:50.177 --> 00:47:52.471
We tend to forget, toilets need air.

798
00:48:05.984 --> 00:48:08.195
What are you doing, Baldy?

799
00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:13.950
I'm hooking up cables.

800
00:48:18.372 --> 00:48:19.956
- You okay?
- Yeah.


801
00:48:20.624 --> 00:48:23.585
Thanks.
You saved my life, brother.


802
00:48:27.631 --> 00:48:28.631
That's him!

803
00:48:28.674 --> 00:48:30.217
He electrocuted Mohamed.

804
00:48:31.259 --> 00:48:32.259
Him?

805
00:48:33.095 --> 00:48:34.179
No, not him.

806
00:48:34.346 --> 00:48:35.430
- Yes, it was.
- No.


807
00:48:35.555 --> 00:48:36.390
I saw him.

808
00:48:36.515 --> 00:48:37.557
He saw him.

809
00:48:39.935 --> 00:48:40.935
You there!

810
00:48:41.436 --> 00:48:42.437
What's this?

811
00:48:42.604 --> 00:48:43.647
That's not nice.

812
00:48:43.814 --> 00:48:45.983
You can't just electrocute people.

813
00:48:48.944 --> 00:48:50.070
I'm super upset.

814
00:48:50.237 --> 00:48:51.321
There.

815
00:48:52.364 --> 00:48:53.615
I laid into him.

816
00:48:53.782 --> 00:48:56.326
Usually it's a kick in the ass.

817
00:48:59.287 --> 00:49:01.665
He's right.
It's the price to pay.


818
00:49:01.832 --> 00:49:02.958
No.

819
00:49:03.125 --> 00:49:04.292
No.

820
00:49:04.459 --> 00:49:05.752
Come on.

821
00:49:08.380 --> 00:49:09.923
He'll never do it.

822
00:49:10.257 --> 00:49:11.383
Sure he will.

823
00:49:11.550 --> 00:49:12.550
Let him go.

824
00:49:12.676 --> 00:49:14.052
Let him go! I'm the boss!

825
00:49:15.262 --> 00:49:17.055
Stand back.

826
00:49:22.144 --> 00:49:23.937
Please turn around, captain.

827
00:49:24.104 --> 00:49:25.230
What'll you do?

828
00:49:26.189 --> 00:49:27.566
Kick you in the ass.

829
00:49:30.736 --> 00:49:33.155
You can't do that, Hakim.
I'm your captain.


830
00:49:33.322 --> 00:49:34.364
I have to.

831
00:49:40.037 --> 00:49:42.039
- Where you going?
- I need to run up.


832
00:49:43.707 --> 00:49:44.707
It'll be fine.

833
00:50:00.807 --> 00:50:02.434
That was too much.

834
00:50:02.726 --> 00:50:04.102
This is pure hell.

835
00:50:05.646 --> 00:50:06.938
Bye, boss.

836
00:50:07.272 --> 00:50:09.691
- See you tomorrow.
- Sure, obrigado.


837
00:50:10.525 --> 00:50:12.444
I'm organizing a May 13 party.

838
00:50:12.611 --> 00:50:14.613
I'd be happy if you came.

839
00:50:15.072 --> 00:50:18.158
- You're inviting me?
- I have a present for you.


840
00:50:18.325 --> 00:50:19.826
Salami. My dad makes it.

841
00:50:19.993 --> 00:50:21.286
You shouldn't have.

842
00:50:21.453 --> 00:50:22.287
Yes.

843
00:50:22.454 --> 00:50:24.915
- No.
- It's close to your heart.


844
00:50:25.082 --> 00:50:27.125
- The smell of Portugal.
- Of Portugal?


845
00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:30.754
PORTUGUESE EVENING

846
00:50:51.441 --> 00:50:53.235
I know what you're feeling.

847
00:50:53.819 --> 00:50:56.530
You do your best
and it all goes sour.

848
00:50:56.697 --> 00:50:57.948
But that's okay.

849
00:50:58.115 --> 00:51:00.867
Don't give up. 
Believe in yourself.

850
00:51:01.493 --> 00:51:02.953
Be strong, Julia.

851
00:51:03.245 --> 00:51:05.330
I'm sure you'll succeed.

852
00:51:12.546 --> 00:51:13.630
You know what?

853
00:51:13.797 --> 00:51:16.675
When I'm down,
I have something that never fails.


854
00:51:17.134 --> 00:51:19.428
Let out everything inside.

855
00:51:19.594 --> 00:51:20.594
Go on, hit.

856
00:51:21.388 --> 00:51:22.388
I'm fed up.

857
00:51:22.431 --> 00:51:23.598
Harder.

858
00:51:24.057 --> 00:51:25.057
I'm fed up.

859
00:51:25.100 --> 00:51:26.100
Harder.

860
00:51:26.768 --> 00:51:30.480
- I'm sick of work and responsibilities!
- Good.


861
00:51:30.897 --> 00:51:33.817
- Sick of no one respecting me!
- Let it out!


862
00:51:33.900 --> 00:51:35.736
Sick of worrying about my dad!

863
00:51:35.902 --> 00:51:36.737
More.

864
00:51:36.903 --> 00:51:38.447
Sick of problems!

865
00:51:38.613 --> 00:51:40.449
Sick of all those sexists.

866
00:51:40.615 --> 00:51:42.159
No holds barred.

867
00:51:42.326 --> 00:51:43.160
Hit!

868
00:51:43.327 --> 00:51:46.538
Sick of you making things worse
when you came to help!


869
00:51:46.705 --> 00:51:48.290
- Easy.
- Your incompetence


870
00:51:48.457 --> 00:51:49.875
and stupidity!

871
00:51:50.042 --> 00:51:51.918
You've got to be a moron

872
00:51:52.085 --> 00:51:53.420
to piss in the cement!

873
00:51:55.297 --> 00:51:56.340
The bitch.

874
00:51:56.506 --> 00:51:57.549
I'm sorry, Joaquim.

875
00:52:05.474 --> 00:52:06.516
Salsa class!

876
00:52:06.933 --> 00:52:08.435
Hello, ma'am.

877
00:52:08.602 --> 00:52:10.854
I'd like to sign up for the gym.

878
00:52:11.104 --> 00:52:13.106
Dr. Truong told me, "Aïcha,

879
00:52:13.273 --> 00:52:15.317
exercise is good for your health."

880
00:52:15.484 --> 00:52:17.527
- Want me to show you around?
- Sure.


881
00:52:18.528 --> 00:52:21.615
- It stinks.
- Sports smell strong, ma'am.


882
00:52:21.782 --> 00:52:22.866
Forward!

883
00:52:23.033 --> 00:52:24.326
And back!

884
00:52:24.493 --> 00:52:25.952
Circle to the right!

885
00:52:28.789 --> 00:52:30.332
Move the shoulders!

886
00:52:32.626 --> 00:52:34.252
A step to the side!

887
00:52:39.007 --> 00:52:41.385
- I didn't know you liked salsa.
- Me either.


888
00:52:41.551 --> 00:52:43.929
It must not be easy to keep clean.

889
00:52:44.805 --> 00:52:46.473
That's our salsa room.

890
00:52:55.732 --> 00:52:57.150
I'll do salsa right now.

891
00:52:57.317 --> 00:52:59.277
Choose your partner!

892
00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:06.200
Hello.

893
00:53:07.119 --> 00:53:08.578
My name is Aïcha.

894
00:53:09.913 --> 00:53:12.457
But my friends call me...

895
00:53:12.708 --> 00:53:14.251
Aïcha too.

896
00:53:14.418 --> 00:53:16.086
I've seen you somewhere.

897
00:53:16.253 --> 00:53:17.087
No.

898
00:53:17.212 --> 00:53:18.755
It's incredible.

899
00:53:18.922 --> 00:53:21.383
You look just like my husband young.

900
00:53:24.428 --> 00:53:25.429
Thanks.

901
00:53:26.096 --> 00:53:27.514
Change partners!

902
00:53:29.308 --> 00:53:30.308
Julia.

903
00:53:31.685 --> 00:53:33.562
It's funny, she looks familiar.

904
00:53:33.729 --> 00:53:35.314
Calm down, ma'am.

905
00:53:35.731 --> 00:53:37.149
She seems to like you.

906
00:53:38.900 --> 00:53:39.901
I know!

907
00:53:40.068 --> 00:53:41.403
My father's mistress!

908
00:53:41.570 --> 00:53:44.031
Yes, I saw her on his phone.

909
00:53:44.197 --> 00:53:45.824
Change partners.

910
00:53:48.285 --> 00:53:49.870
Hug me. Dance with me.

911
00:53:54.499 --> 00:53:56.626
- Your hubby?
- No, a distant cousin.


912
00:53:56.793 --> 00:53:57.836
Is he single?

913
00:53:58.003 --> 00:53:59.129
Yes.

914
00:54:00.881 --> 00:54:02.591
Time to change partners!

915
00:54:05.260 --> 00:54:06.803
You like Moroccan cooking?

916
00:54:07.846 --> 00:54:09.222
I feel funny.

917
00:54:09.389 --> 00:54:13.143
My heart is trembling
like the ocean tide at night.


918
00:54:14.019 --> 00:54:15.103
Change partners!

919
00:54:17.397 --> 00:54:18.523
Forward!

920
00:54:28.033 --> 00:54:31.078
- What's wrong?
- Shit, stop scaring me!


921
00:54:31.244 --> 00:54:32.663
Hey, I'm still your boss.

922
00:54:32.829 --> 00:54:34.039
Sorry, captain.

923
00:54:34.206 --> 00:54:35.207
Any intel?

924
00:54:35.374 --> 00:54:37.918
- She's starting to trust me.
- Very good.


925
00:54:38.085 --> 00:54:40.087
- Where is she?
- Taking a shower.


926
00:54:40.253 --> 00:54:42.881
- Hurry up, go search her purse.
- Yes, sir!


927
00:54:44.299 --> 00:54:45.384
Give me the soap.

928
00:55:54.202 --> 00:55:55.537
What are you doing?

929
00:55:56.163 --> 00:56:00.042
I wanted to talk to you
and I saw your mother's picture.


930
00:56:08.050 --> 00:56:09.468
I wanted to thank you.

931
00:56:09.843 --> 00:56:12.596
No one's taken care of me
in a long time.


932
00:56:12.971 --> 00:56:14.264
It's only normal.

933
00:56:20.062 --> 00:56:22.522
When Mom passed away,
Dad was desperate.


934
00:56:23.357 --> 00:56:26.401
She was more than his wife,
she was his equilibrium.


935
00:56:27.778 --> 00:56:30.238
So... I tried to compensate.

936
00:56:30.405 --> 00:56:31.948
I quit my job

937
00:56:32.115 --> 00:56:34.743
and I moved back home
to fill the void.


938
00:56:34.910 --> 00:56:36.745
I do my best, but it's not easy.

939
00:56:37.037 --> 00:56:38.497
I'm there for everyone.

940
00:56:38.664 --> 00:56:41.416
For Dad, for the company,
for the workers.


941
00:56:45.337 --> 00:56:47.589
And so, I put my life on hold.

942
00:56:48.882 --> 00:56:50.676
Mine's on hold too.

943
00:56:51.093 --> 00:56:52.594
Because of my mother.

944
00:56:52.761 --> 00:56:54.096
She's a hypochondriac,

945
00:56:54.262 --> 00:56:56.264
depressive and even suicidal.

946
00:56:56.932 --> 00:56:58.266
- She is?
- Yes.


947
00:56:58.433 --> 00:56:59.977
Since my father died.

948
00:57:01.395 --> 00:57:03.021
Uncle Augusto died?

949
00:57:03.981 --> 00:57:07.317
What happened?
He was in great shape last summer.


950
00:57:09.528 --> 00:57:12.322
What happened?
He caught chickenpox.


951
00:57:12.489 --> 00:57:14.032
Chickenpox?

952
00:57:14.199 --> 00:57:15.409
A raging case.

953
00:57:15.575 --> 00:57:18.286
One morning,
he had little spots and that night,


954
00:57:18.453 --> 00:57:19.496
no more Augusto!

955
00:57:19.871 --> 00:57:22.332
Done. We're fragile creatures.

956
00:57:22.499 --> 00:57:24.918
Poor thing,
that's why you're scatterbrained.


957
00:57:25.085 --> 00:57:27.004
That's why I'm scatterbrained.

958
00:57:27.170 --> 00:57:28.338
That's why.

959
00:57:30.298 --> 00:57:32.009
Damned chickenpox!

960
00:57:32.342 --> 00:57:33.760
I'm so sorry.

961
00:57:36.555 --> 00:57:39.016
Don't tell Dad, he couldn't take it.

962
00:57:40.017 --> 00:57:41.143
Hold me tight.

963
00:57:41.935 --> 00:57:43.395
I'm so sad.

964
00:57:43.854 --> 00:57:45.439
Tighter.

965
00:57:45.731 --> 00:57:47.024
A little more.

966
00:57:47.149 --> 00:57:47.983
More.

967
00:57:48.108 --> 00:57:49.526
That's good.

968
00:57:49.776 --> 00:57:50.986
So good.

969
00:58:03.540 --> 00:58:04.541
I'm sorry.

970
00:58:07.461 --> 00:58:09.421
What did you want to ask me?

971
00:58:11.423 --> 00:58:14.468
I wanted to know
where you buy your cement.


972
00:58:14.885 --> 00:58:17.137
It's very good quality.

973
00:58:19.681 --> 00:58:21.725
No, it's not important.

974
00:58:21.975 --> 00:58:23.185
It doesn't matter.

975
00:58:24.311 --> 00:58:25.479
Good night, Joaquim.

976
00:58:25.646 --> 00:58:26.813
Good night.

977
00:59:09.398 --> 00:59:10.482
Well?

978
00:59:11.274 --> 00:59:12.274
A drink?

979
00:59:12.317 --> 00:59:14.945
Aguardente from Portugal.

980
00:59:15.112 --> 00:59:16.112
What?

981
00:59:16.196 --> 00:59:17.447
Aguardente.

982
00:59:19.658 --> 00:59:20.951
Here goes.

983
00:59:21.660 --> 00:59:22.744
No.

984
00:59:22.911 --> 00:59:25.372
Never on the job. Never!

985
00:59:25.914 --> 00:59:29.167
I don't know why,
but I don't trust that Joaquim.


986
00:59:29.334 --> 00:59:30.334
Grandma!

987
00:59:30.419 --> 00:59:32.879
You can't say no,
it's my grandfather's.


988
00:59:33.380 --> 00:59:34.380
Can't say no.

989
00:59:34.506 --> 00:59:36.008
It's his grandfather's.

990
00:59:41.471 --> 00:59:43.432
- Obrigado.
- Bottoms up!


991
01:00:04.411 --> 01:00:05.662
And a second.

992
01:00:06.663 --> 01:00:07.998
We should go easy.

993
01:00:08.832 --> 01:00:10.250
What's in that?

994
01:00:11.084 --> 01:00:12.084
Grapes.

995
01:00:24.639 --> 01:00:26.475
BRAZILIAN WAXING

996
01:00:26.892 --> 01:00:27.893
Hello, ma'am.

997
01:00:54.670 --> 01:00:55.670
What's he doing?

998
01:00:57.005 --> 01:00:58.590
His feet must be warm.

999
01:01:11.645 --> 01:01:13.146
Dear parishioners,

1000
01:01:13.313 --> 01:01:14.648
on this May 13,

1001
01:01:14.815 --> 01:01:16.274
we celebrate Fátima...

1002
01:01:16.441 --> 01:01:17.609
What's he doing?

1003
01:01:17.776 --> 01:01:18.902
Counting fingers.

1004
01:01:19.695 --> 01:01:21.863
...the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit.


1005
01:01:22.030 --> 01:01:23.030
Amen.

1006
01:01:23.865 --> 01:01:25.117
You may sit.

1007
01:01:26.368 --> 01:01:27.661
As Saint Paul said,

1008
01:01:27.828 --> 01:01:29.121
my brothers...

1009
01:01:30.539 --> 01:01:32.749
A real pro.
He's checking the tiles.


1010
01:01:34.751 --> 01:01:36.003
What if we sang?

1011
01:01:36.545 --> 01:01:38.088
A little song?

1012
01:01:38.255 --> 01:01:39.256
Wanna sing?

1013
01:01:39.423 --> 01:01:40.549
Let's sing!

1014
01:01:43.802 --> 01:01:44.802
Stand!

1015
01:01:44.845 --> 01:01:46.930
Stay as you are, you're fabulous.

1016
01:02:03.322 --> 01:02:05.198
First off, I wish to greet

1017
01:02:05.365 --> 01:02:07.200
the Portuguese community,

1018
01:02:07.367 --> 01:02:09.286
who help preserve our church.

1019
01:02:09.828 --> 01:02:10.662
Namely

1020
01:02:10.829 --> 01:02:12.039
our benefactor,

1021
01:02:12.205 --> 01:02:13.832
José de Almeida!

1022
01:02:13.999 --> 01:02:16.001
You can recognize him by his arms.

1023
01:02:16.418 --> 01:02:17.502
Wonderful.

1024
01:02:17.669 --> 01:02:20.005
Thank you, José.
I have tears in my eyes.


1025
01:02:20.172 --> 01:02:21.340
José's a swell guy.

1026
01:02:21.506 --> 01:02:22.883
We have with us

1027
01:02:23.050 --> 01:02:25.385
a believer who performed a heroic feat.

1028
01:02:25.719 --> 01:02:27.512
He delivered a baby by himself.

1029
01:02:27.929 --> 01:02:29.973
Straight from Portugal!

1030
01:02:30.265 --> 01:02:31.892
Let's hear applause!

1031
01:02:31.975 --> 01:02:34.478
Make some noise for Joaquim!

1032
01:03:05.801 --> 01:03:06.801
Go on.

1033
01:03:07.886 --> 01:03:09.513
Have you ever noticed?

1034
01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:12.224
- That guy...
- Yes, Jesus Christ.


1035
01:03:12.766 --> 01:03:14.101
- He's Portuguese.
- No.


1036
01:03:14.476 --> 01:03:15.310
Yes.

1037
01:03:15.477 --> 01:03:16.895
- Yes, he is.
- No.


1038
01:03:17.062 --> 01:03:18.730
His dad was a carpenter.

1039
01:03:18.897 --> 01:03:20.691
A builder, like the Portuguese!

1040
01:03:21.525 --> 01:03:24.277
What do Portuguese serve their guests?

1041
01:03:24.444 --> 01:03:26.530
Porto wine. Like Jesus Christ!

1042
01:03:27.572 --> 01:03:29.700
We Portuguese are the best!

1043
01:03:30.117 --> 01:03:31.368
Yeah!

1044
01:03:32.035 --> 01:03:34.705
The Chinese took 200 years
to build a wall.


1045
01:03:34.871 --> 01:03:37.416
A Portuguese
would've done it in two weeks.


1046
01:03:38.417 --> 01:03:41.044
The pyramids,
with those funny pharaohs...


1047
01:03:41.962 --> 01:03:43.255
Nothing but rock.

1048
01:03:43.422 --> 01:03:46.550
A Portuguese
would've put a skylight for fresh air!


1049
01:03:46.717 --> 01:03:49.594
Put a Portuguese on Survivor,
he'd win for sure!


1050
01:03:49.761 --> 01:03:50.762
No need for huts.

1051
01:03:50.929 --> 01:03:53.557
He'd make cement
with sand and water and build


1052
01:03:53.724 --> 01:03:54.808
your house!

1053
01:03:55.934 --> 01:03:58.061
That's all, folks, that was Joaquim!

1054
01:04:23.795 --> 01:04:25.005
He's saying mass.

1055
01:04:25.172 --> 01:04:27.049
Not in Latin. Portuguese, ma'am.

1056
01:04:39.853 --> 01:04:42.314
I haven't seen Dad like that in ages.

1057
01:04:43.023 --> 01:04:45.150
He hasn't laughed since Mom died.

1058
01:04:54.159 --> 01:04:55.285
Thank you.

1059
01:04:55.452 --> 01:04:56.828
No, thank you.

1060
01:05:00.582 --> 01:05:04.044
Come on, it's time to party!

1061
01:05:04.836 --> 01:05:05.671
Party time!

1062
01:05:05.796 --> 01:05:07.673
- It's time to what?
- Party!


1063
01:05:36.034 --> 01:05:37.703
What's Baldy doing here?

1064
01:05:37.869 --> 01:05:39.496
- Who invited him?
- Claude.


1065
01:05:39.663 --> 01:05:41.832
To apologize
for the kick in the ass.


1066
01:05:42.708 --> 01:05:43.834
What the hell?

1067
01:05:44.001 --> 01:05:45.669
Calm down, I was invited.

1068
01:05:46.044 --> 01:05:48.880
It's not them, sir.
They're not drug traffickers.


1069
01:05:49.631 --> 01:05:50.882
They're good people.

1070
01:05:51.049 --> 01:05:52.217
Look.

1071
01:05:56.138 --> 01:05:57.431
You know what?

1072
01:05:58.598 --> 01:06:00.142
I've never been so happy.

1073
01:06:00.309 --> 01:06:01.810
Hakim, stop right now!

1074
01:06:02.602 --> 01:06:04.354
Keep your eyes open.

1075
01:06:06.148 --> 01:06:07.691
- What's this?
- Bacalhau.


1076
01:06:10.068 --> 01:06:11.068
With cod?

1077
01:06:11.445 --> 01:06:12.529
Of course.

1078
01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:14.323
Of course.

1079
01:06:24.291 --> 01:06:26.543
Bravo, Dad.
I see you waste no time.


1080
01:06:26.626 --> 01:06:28.295
You invited your mistress?

1081
01:06:33.258 --> 01:06:35.802
Yes, you did.
She didn't come on her own.


1082
01:06:40.390 --> 01:06:41.390
Chabin?

1083
01:06:41.433 --> 01:06:43.602
Bet you wouldn't set off a flashbang.

1084
01:06:43.769 --> 01:06:45.270
You wanna see?

1085
01:06:53.153 --> 01:06:54.404
My little Baumard!

1086
01:06:56.031 --> 01:06:57.032
Chabin!

1087
01:06:58.158 --> 01:06:59.534
My little birdie.

1088
01:07:20.972 --> 01:07:22.015
Liar!

1089
01:07:31.024 --> 01:07:32.401
Liar.

1090
01:07:33.568 --> 01:07:34.611
He's a liar.

1091
01:07:36.113 --> 01:07:37.948
He's hiding something from us.

1092
01:07:39.992 --> 01:07:41.201
Whoever you are,

1093
01:07:41.368 --> 01:07:43.537
I know you're not Portuguese.

1094
01:07:43.912 --> 01:07:46.623
Stop, Grandma.
Of course he's Portuguese.


1095
01:07:47.249 --> 01:07:48.917
Tell her you're Portuguese.

1096
01:07:50.127 --> 01:07:51.211
Tell her!

1097
01:08:01.263 --> 01:08:02.431
Tell her!

1098
01:08:08.895 --> 01:08:10.272
To arms,

1099
01:08:10.772 --> 01:08:12.024
to arms!

1100
01:08:12.357 --> 01:08:14.067
Over the land,

1101
01:08:14.234 --> 01:08:15.777
over the sea.

1102
01:08:16.194 --> 01:08:17.904
To arms,

1103
01:08:18.070 --> 01:08:20.032
to arms!

1104
01:08:20.198 --> 01:08:21.615
To fight

1105
01:08:21.783 --> 01:08:24.160
for our Fatherland!

1106
01:08:24.328 --> 01:08:26.204
Against the cannons,

1107
01:08:26.371 --> 01:08:27.831
march...

1108
01:08:27.998 --> 01:08:29.958
march!

1109
01:09:29.517 --> 01:09:31.311
Captain,
you stun-gunned my mom!


1110
01:09:31.477 --> 01:09:34.439
- What's she doing here?
- She's in love with me.


1111
01:09:34.606 --> 01:09:37.025
Go back in, I'll take care of her.

1112
01:09:39.569 --> 01:09:40.861
This is pure hell.

1113
01:10:02.300 --> 01:10:04.386
I need to tell you something.

1114
01:10:04.678 --> 01:10:05.929
Don't say a word.

1115
01:10:06.346 --> 01:10:07.556
Listen.

1116
01:10:17.566 --> 01:10:19.735
The lyrics are beautiful.

1117
01:11:00.567 --> 01:11:02.027
You know, Julia...

1118
01:11:02.194 --> 01:11:03.820
I'm not the man you think.

1119
01:11:04.363 --> 01:11:05.697
I know, Joaquim.

1120
01:11:06.448 --> 01:11:07.699
You're different.

1121
01:12:25.235 --> 01:12:27.237
We searched your house.

1122
01:12:27.571 --> 01:12:28.780
We found this.

1123
01:12:28.947 --> 01:12:30.198
What's this dough?

1124
01:12:34.536 --> 01:12:37.664
For the last time,
I don't speak your language.


1125
01:12:37.831 --> 01:12:38.832
In French.

1126
01:12:39.958 --> 01:12:41.001
Old nanny goat!

1127
01:12:44.588 --> 01:12:46.840
You want to see your son grow up?

1128
01:12:48.717 --> 01:12:49.717
Forget it.

1129
01:12:49.843 --> 01:12:52.304
Because unless you talk,
I'll lock you up.


1130
01:12:52.637 --> 01:12:53.847
Okay.

1131
01:12:55.015 --> 01:12:57.517
- I know where the drugs are.
- Where?


1132
01:13:01.229 --> 01:13:02.481
Up your ass.

1133
01:13:14.076 --> 01:13:16.787
Guess what.
We had a mole on the worksite.


1134
01:13:19.998 --> 01:13:20.998
Hakim!

1135
01:13:33.595 --> 01:13:35.806
Meet Hakim Dhouieb,

1136
01:13:35.972 --> 01:13:37.265
aka "Joaquim."

1137
01:13:39.893 --> 01:13:41.436
That's not Joaquim.

1138
01:13:42.312 --> 01:13:44.314
Joaquim would never betray us.

1139
01:13:57.369 --> 01:13:58.745
Look me in the eyes.

1140
01:14:01.915 --> 01:14:03.709
Look me in the eyes.

1141
01:14:09.673 --> 01:14:10.924
You betrayed us.

1142
01:14:11.425 --> 01:14:12.801
Betrayed you?

1143
01:14:13.260 --> 01:14:14.261
And the money?

1144
01:14:14.636 --> 01:14:17.139
It's Avó Lena's lifetime savings.

1145
01:14:17.305 --> 01:14:19.599
It was to bail out the company.

1146
01:14:20.225 --> 01:14:23.020
If we went under,
my father would've died twice.


1147
01:14:24.813 --> 01:14:26.565
That's what the money is.

1148
01:14:38.535 --> 01:14:40.495
Has the dago finished?

1149
01:14:40.662 --> 01:14:42.331
Don't talk to her like that.

1150
01:14:42.497 --> 01:14:44.499
Who are you? Just a pawn.

1151
01:14:44.666 --> 01:14:45.834
You're pitiful.

1152
01:14:46.001 --> 01:14:48.295
Don't speak
to my men or them like that!


1153
01:14:48.462 --> 01:14:50.339
You're just a small-time cop.

1154
01:14:50.714 --> 01:14:52.632
Perhaps, but I know the law.

1155
01:14:52.799 --> 01:14:56.011
You have nothing
and they've been in custody 48 hours.


1156
01:14:56.178 --> 01:14:58.764
So please release them,
Mrs. Faillancier.


1157
01:14:58.930 --> 01:15:00.641
You can start packing up.

1158
01:15:00.807 --> 01:15:02.601
You're fired, as of now!

1159
01:15:02.976 --> 01:15:03.977
Out of my sight.

1160
01:15:06.188 --> 01:15:07.439
Let them go.

1161
01:15:22.788 --> 01:15:24.706
Mr. Hakim, how are you?

1162
01:16:02.077 --> 01:16:02.953
Ahmed.

1163
01:16:03.036 --> 01:16:05.998
I have something
very serious to tell you.


1164
01:16:11.545 --> 01:16:13.755
I fell in love with someone.

1165
01:16:14.798 --> 01:16:16.133
I don't understand.

1166
01:16:16.299 --> 01:16:17.551
I don't know.

1167
01:16:17.926 --> 01:16:20.137
I think I had love at first sight.

1168
01:16:21.221 --> 01:16:23.515
But don't worry, it's all over.

1169
01:16:23.849 --> 01:16:26.184
I can see clearly again.

1170
01:16:26.685 --> 01:16:28.562
I never want to see him again.

1171
01:16:30.147 --> 01:16:31.189
Forgive me.

1172
01:16:31.857 --> 01:16:35.485
You'll always be the love
of my entire life.


1173
01:16:48.332 --> 01:16:51.251
I'm tasting the quality and the texture.

1174
01:16:55.130 --> 01:16:57.507
"Cut the truffle in thin slices."

1175
01:17:02.846 --> 01:17:06.183
- Captain, it's me.
- I'm not your captain, I was sacked.


1176
01:17:06.266 --> 01:17:07.100
Captain,

1177
01:17:07.225 --> 01:17:10.437
I'm not sure where the drugs are,
but I know who's boss.


1178
01:17:10.604 --> 01:17:12.898
- Meet me on the site.
- De Almeida's?


1179
01:17:13.065 --> 01:17:13.899
Yes.

1180
01:17:13.982 --> 01:17:15.233
Listen here, Hakim.

1181
01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:17.569
There's no site or investigation.

1182
01:17:17.736 --> 01:17:21.031
I'm going to hang up
and make truffle eggs. Do the same.


1183
01:17:38.632 --> 01:17:39.800
Oh, shit!

1184
01:17:52.813 --> 01:17:54.231
It's up to you, Joaquim.

1185
01:18:44.990 --> 01:18:47.034
Kraczyk the Pole!

1186
01:18:47.784 --> 01:18:49.411
How did you guess?

1187
01:18:50.662 --> 01:18:53.749
I brushed my teeth.
My mouth was full of toothpaste.


1188
01:18:53.915 --> 01:18:55.584
That's when it hit me!

1189
01:18:55.876 --> 01:18:58.754
You weren't looking for cement quality.

1190
01:18:58.920 --> 01:19:00.255
You wanted your coke!

1191
01:19:00.714 --> 01:19:02.049
But I don't understand.

1192
01:19:02.549 --> 01:19:04.343
Why this worksite?

1193
01:19:04.509 --> 01:19:06.511
To avoid suspicion,

1194
01:19:06.762 --> 01:19:08.847
we used normal transport routes.

1195
01:19:09.348 --> 01:19:11.183
Unfortunately, an employee

1196
01:19:11.350 --> 01:19:13.518
stuck the wrong label on.

1197
01:19:14.144 --> 01:19:15.187
And so,

1198
01:19:15.354 --> 01:19:17.356
we received dry cement.

1199
01:19:17.898 --> 01:19:19.524
And the De Almeidas...

1200
01:19:20.067 --> 01:19:21.568
received my coke.

1201
01:19:22.569 --> 01:19:23.820
Kraczyk!

1202
01:19:23.987 --> 01:19:26.657
All this because of a wrong label?

1203
01:19:26.948 --> 01:19:30.744
All this because your cocaine
had a wrong label stuck on!


1204
01:19:30.911 --> 01:19:33.330
Those things happen, Kraczyk.

1205
01:19:33.497 --> 01:19:35.999
Sometimes I order things,
but no label stuck.


1206
01:19:36.166 --> 01:19:38.585
Or stuck wrong.
Stuck here, stuck there.


1207
01:19:38.752 --> 01:19:39.752
Don't move!

1208
01:19:45.759 --> 01:19:46.760
Why do you laugh?

1209
01:20:02.526 --> 01:20:04.027
That's why I laugh.

1210
01:20:05.570 --> 01:20:06.655
Don't hurt her.

1211
01:20:06.822 --> 01:20:08.824
I won't hurt her if you tell me

1212
01:20:08.991 --> 01:20:10.283
right away

1213
01:20:10.450 --> 01:20:12.119
where my fucking coke is!

1214
01:20:13.578 --> 01:20:14.830
A people united

1215
01:20:14.997 --> 01:20:16.206
will never be defeated!

1216
01:20:16.915 --> 01:20:19.668
A people united will never be defeated!

1217
01:20:19.835 --> 01:20:20.961
Attack!

1218
01:20:34.016 --> 01:20:35.600
Ouch, I'm with you!

1219
01:20:35.684 --> 01:20:37.060
Sorry, boss.

1220
01:20:45.444 --> 01:20:47.029
I'm the boss, shit.

1221
01:20:47.195 --> 01:20:48.030
Kraczyk?

1222
01:20:48.113 --> 01:20:49.197
Julia?

1223
01:21:14.222 --> 01:21:15.641
Boss!

1224
01:22:01.186 --> 01:22:02.729
Saved by pork.

1225
01:22:04.106 --> 01:22:05.983
Police, you're under arrest!

1226
01:22:09.736 --> 01:22:12.364
It's Baldy, he's with Kraczyk.

1227
01:22:12.906 --> 01:22:13.991
No?

1228
01:22:14.449 --> 01:22:15.492
Bad move?

1229
01:22:26.086 --> 01:22:27.754
I came to press charges.

1230
01:22:30.382 --> 01:22:33.301
I was lied to,
betrayed, tricked and used.


1231
01:22:33.468 --> 01:22:35.053
My family was harmed.

1232
01:22:35.220 --> 01:22:36.220
You writing?

1233
01:22:36.930 --> 01:22:38.181
Yes, of course.

1234
01:22:38.598 --> 01:22:42.477
I thought I'd found a man
who was sensitive and understanding.


1235
01:22:42.978 --> 01:22:44.646
Maybe he had no choice.

1236
01:22:44.813 --> 01:22:46.231
Hush, I'm the plaintiff.

1237
01:22:47.733 --> 01:22:49.943
The problem is that despite it all...

1238
01:22:50.485 --> 01:22:51.737
despite what he did...

1239
01:22:54.614 --> 01:22:56.241
I can't get him off my mind.

1240
01:23:00.287 --> 01:23:01.413
I'm sorry.

1241
01:23:02.956 --> 01:23:04.624
That's for lying to me.

1242
01:23:06.543 --> 01:23:08.420
And this is for saving my life.

1243
01:23:19.848 --> 01:23:21.558
This is my husband.

1244
01:23:22.643 --> 01:23:24.686
- May I?
- Of course you can.


1245
01:23:25.562 --> 01:23:27.564
- What are you doing?
- Never know.


1246
01:23:27.731 --> 01:23:29.816
- Never know what?
- It saved his life.


1247
01:23:30.817 --> 01:23:31.860
Captain!

1248
01:23:36.406 --> 01:23:38.325
- Feeling better?
- Yes, it was nothing.


1249
01:23:38.492 --> 01:23:39.534
Glad to see you.

1250
01:23:39.701 --> 01:23:41.119
Glad to be here.

1251
01:23:41.286 --> 01:23:43.789
I'm so proud.
You deserved your medal.


1252
01:23:43.955 --> 01:23:46.833
Say, Hakim,
my memories are fuzzy.


1253
01:23:47.250 --> 01:23:49.836
- Did I really arrest everyone?
- Barehanded!


1254
01:23:50.003 --> 01:23:51.713
Like a lion! It was amazing.

1255
01:23:52.130 --> 01:23:53.423
- You're sure?
- Certain.


1256
01:23:53.590 --> 01:23:55.801
If you say so, 
I guess it's true.

1257
01:23:55.967 --> 01:23:57.761
- If it was me...
- It was.


1258
01:23:58.095 --> 01:24:01.014
It was me.
No need to rewrite history.


1259
01:24:01.181 --> 01:24:02.181
It was me.

1260
01:24:04.142 --> 01:24:06.603
- Did you hear about Faillancier?
- No.


1261
01:24:06.770 --> 01:24:07.770
She was fired.

1262
01:24:09.439 --> 01:24:11.233
Let's have a drink, captain.

1263
01:24:12.150 --> 01:24:13.568
Colonel!

1264
01:24:14.736 --> 01:24:16.238
You forgot your meds.

1265
01:24:16.405 --> 01:24:18.073
I don't need them anymore.

1266
01:24:20.409 --> 01:24:22.452
I've never breathed easier.

1267
01:24:25.831 --> 01:24:27.624
He must be proud of you.

1268
01:24:35.298 --> 01:24:38.010
José, tell me,
what happened to you?


1269
01:24:38.176 --> 01:24:39.970
I have no recollection.

1270
01:24:40.137 --> 01:24:42.556
I only know
I fell down the church steps.


1271
01:24:43.181 --> 01:24:46.476
He came to repair a step
and renovated the whole church.


1272
01:24:46.643 --> 01:24:48.145
In one day. Right?

1273
01:24:48.562 --> 01:24:49.730
It's true.

1274
01:24:50.105 --> 01:24:51.982
I've been all fired up ever since!

1275
01:24:52.149 --> 01:24:53.442
Right, José?

1276
01:25:04.619 --> 01:25:06.330
Incredible, isn't it?

1277
01:25:07.789 --> 01:25:09.416
What's done is done.

1278
01:25:09.791 --> 01:25:10.791
There.

1279
01:25:12.169 --> 01:25:13.169
Let's get a drink.

1280
01:25:13.211 --> 01:25:14.211
Two!

1281
01:25:21.970 --> 01:25:23.263
No, I won't.

1282
01:25:23.430 --> 01:25:24.514
Why not?

1283
01:25:24.681 --> 01:25:26.600
I don't understand when you talk.

1284
01:25:26.767 --> 01:25:28.101
A problem, ladies?

1285
01:25:28.268 --> 01:25:30.646
She wants to put pork in my tajine.

1286
01:25:30.812 --> 01:25:33.857
And she wants to put harissa paste
in the cod.


1287
01:25:35.025 --> 01:25:36.318
Calm down.

1288
01:25:36.485 --> 01:25:37.736
I have an idea.

1289
01:25:40.530 --> 01:25:41.530
Apron.

1290
01:25:41.615 --> 01:25:42.991
Apron?

1291
01:25:43.533 --> 01:25:45.035
Look me in the eye.

1292
01:25:45.619 --> 01:25:47.954
Go wash your hands right now!

1293
01:25:51.833 --> 01:25:53.251
It's coming!

1294
01:25:55.754 --> 01:25:58.131
Here we are,
ladies and gentlemen.


1295
01:25:58.298 --> 01:26:00.759
Veal in white sauce!

1296
01:26:03.637 --> 01:26:05.972
There's harissa paste if anyone wants.

1297
01:26:06.473 --> 01:26:08.392
And sausages too.

1298
01:26:10.143 --> 01:26:11.728
Or you can eat it plain.

1299
01:26:31.832 --> 01:26:33.125
I'll go eat now.

1300
01:26:38.964 --> 01:26:40.173
Avó Lena!

1301
01:26:40.382 --> 01:26:42.259
I'm very happy for you two.

1302
01:26:42.426 --> 01:26:43.593
However...

1303
01:26:43.885 --> 01:26:46.847
as long as I'm alive,
you'll never marry Julia.


1304
01:26:47.014 --> 01:26:48.265
You speak French?

1305
01:26:48.432 --> 01:26:49.516
Of course I do.

1306
01:26:50.309 --> 01:26:51.643
But not a word.

1307
01:26:59.860 --> 01:27:01.486
You didn't wait for me?

1308
01:27:01.653 --> 01:27:03.530
- Who's the boss?
- You, my son.


1309
01:27:03.613 --> 01:27:04.781
Me too, a little.

1310
01:27:05.365 --> 01:27:06.199
Hey,

1311
01:27:06.283 --> 01:27:07.784
where's the real Joaquim?

1312
01:27:09.745 --> 01:27:10.745
Hi, Joaquim.

1313
01:27:11.872 --> 01:27:13.206
- You okay?
- Great.


1314
01:27:13.373 --> 01:27:15.542
You're going to have a roommate.

1315
01:27:15.709 --> 01:27:16.709
Sorry.

1316
01:27:21.757 --> 01:27:23.258
Hello, I'm Joaquim.

1317
01:27:24.384 --> 01:27:25.384
And you?

1318
01:27:50.577 --> 01:27:53.872
A door onto nothing,
ceiling heaters and holes in toilets?


1319
01:27:55.957 --> 01:27:57.459
Yes, that's right.

1320
01:28:00.504 --> 01:28:01.838
I love it.

1321
01:28:02.005 --> 01:28:04.132
It's unstructured, I love it.

1322
01:28:04.800 --> 01:28:06.885
But isn't the door dangerous?

1323
01:28:07.427 --> 01:28:09.221
No, you just need to lock it.

1324
01:28:10.013 --> 01:28:11.723
Of course, how silly of me.

1325
01:28:11.932 --> 01:28:12.932
Obrigado.

1326
01:28:15.602 --> 01:28:16.645
I love it.

1327
01:28:18.814 --> 01:28:22.567
It's the first time in my career
I've seen this.


1328
01:28:25.028 --> 01:28:26.571
Here, my girl. 
You deserve it.

1329
01:28:34.621 --> 01:28:35.622
Does that hurt?

1330
01:28:42.546 --> 01:28:44.131
Do you know this ass?

1331
01:28:46.341 --> 01:28:47.509
Operation Portugal.

1332
01:28:47.676 --> 01:28:49.136
Operation Portuguese.

1333
01:28:52.139 --> 01:28:53.432
What am I?

1334
01:28:55.225 --> 01:28:56.225
That's good.

1335
01:28:57.519 --> 01:28:58.353
The boss.

1336
01:28:58.520 --> 01:29:00.439
Go wash your hands right now.

1337
01:29:00.605 --> 01:29:03.567
I'll do that again
because I forgot a line.


1338
01:29:08.280 --> 01:29:09.448
Asthmatic.

1339
01:29:10.490 --> 01:29:12.034
Like Darth Vader.

1340
01:29:14.995 --> 01:29:15.996
Okay.

1341
01:29:16.371 --> 01:29:17.456
Don't you think it's hot?

1342
01:29:17.831 --> 01:29:18.874
Keep going!

1343
01:29:21.918 --> 01:29:23.211
It's cool, then hot.

1344
01:29:24.463 --> 01:29:25.463
Let them go.

1345
01:29:25.630 --> 01:29:26.630
With sugar?

1346
01:29:28.467 --> 01:29:30.302
- Go make her a coffee.
- What?


1347
01:29:30.802 --> 01:29:32.304
Go make her a coffee!

1348
01:29:33.472 --> 01:29:34.514
Coffee!

1349
01:29:34.681 --> 01:29:35.891
No thanks, I'm good.

1350
01:29:40.604 --> 01:29:42.439
A "houloucouptere."

1351
01:30:00.123 --> 01:30:01.166
Cut!

1352
01:30:01.667 --> 01:30:02.876
52!

1353
01:30:03.043 --> 01:30:03.877
53!

1354
01:30:04.002 --> 01:30:06.213
Shove it,
Roucariès the legend!


1355
01:30:06.546 --> 01:30:08.131
Kiss me, Baumard!

1356
01:30:09.007 --> 01:30:10.133
Watch out!

1357
01:30:18.225 --> 01:30:19.225
Well?

1358
01:30:19.726 --> 01:30:21.269
You look like Chaplin.

1359
01:30:21.520 --> 01:30:23.647
Fantastic, he's my father's idol.

1360
01:30:23.814 --> 01:30:25.774
No, that won't work.

1361
01:30:26.566 --> 01:30:27.566
Look at me.

1362
01:30:28.068 --> 01:30:29.068
It won't work.

1363
01:30:29.194 --> 01:30:30.487
Should I look at you?

1364
01:30:31.154 --> 01:30:32.406
It won't work.

1365
01:30:32.572 --> 01:30:34.199
How about from the side?
