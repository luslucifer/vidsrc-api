00:00:01.892 --> 00:00:06.291
(party guests laughing and chattering)

2
00:00:22.062 --> 00:00:26.238
- I wake up middle of the
night drenched in sweat.


3
00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:28.089
My heart is racing, okay.

4
00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.139
I reach a hand over to
Lindsey's side of the bed.


5
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.303
She's not there and I realize
it's not even our bed.


6
00:00:34.304 --> 00:00:37.200
It's just a sad
mattress on a box spring.

7
00:00:37.201 --> 00:00:39.022
So I make my way into the hallway.

8
00:00:39.023 --> 00:00:40.179
I go into Cooper's room,

9
00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:41.329
that's our son,

10
00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:42.542
and he's not there either.

11
00:00:42.543 --> 00:00:43.510
And so now I'm really nervous.

12
00:00:43.511 --> 00:00:45.476
I got running into Skyler's
room, the baby's room,


13
00:00:45.477 --> 00:00:46.737
and she's not in her crib,

14
00:00:47.616 --> 00:00:50.329
and I realize I'm
not even in my house.

15
00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.488
I'm at some shitty, one
bedroom walkup in uptown,


16
00:00:54.876 --> 00:00:59.526
and I turn around and
suddenly this window appears,


17
00:00:59.527 --> 00:01:02.158
and I just chuck myself
right the fuck out it.


18
00:01:03.792 --> 00:01:05.089
- Why?

19
00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:06.445
- [Corey] To kill myself.

20
00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:09.798
I realize my life is meaningless.

21
00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:11.035
I never started a family.

22
00:01:11.036 --> 00:01:12.579
I never invented Wiggler.

23
00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:13.442
I have no equity.

24
00:01:13.443 --> 00:01:16.050
I never made any choices
or moves of any kind.


25
00:01:16.051 --> 00:01:19.820
I'm 34, jobless, broke, totally alone,

26
00:01:19.821 --> 00:01:22.601
full of self-loathing and shame.

27
00:01:22.602 --> 00:01:25.827
I hate myself, so I kill myself.

28
00:01:28.078 --> 00:01:29.421
That's the nightmare anyway.

29
00:01:30.264 --> 00:01:31.079
But for a minute there.

30
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.961
I mean, Jesus!

31
00:01:31.962 --> 00:01:33.979
Can you imagine, fuck.

32
00:01:35.616 --> 00:01:36.414
How about you.

33
00:01:36.415 --> 00:01:37.214
What do you do?

34
00:01:41.169 --> 00:01:42.080
- I'm a server

35
00:01:45.791 --> 00:01:46.638
at a restaurant.

36
00:01:48.412 --> 00:01:50.056
- Oh, that's cool.

37
00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.313
You're in your 20s, gets better.

38
00:01:54.825 --> 00:01:56.075
- Actually, I'm 34.

39
00:01:59.862 --> 00:02:01.905
- You look good.

40
00:02:01.906 --> 00:02:03.201
Will you excuse me a
second, I see somebody.


41
00:02:03.202 --> 00:02:04.001
- Mm hmm.

42

Hi.

45
00:02:22.801 --> 00:02:23.600
- Hey.

46
00:02:26.608 --> 00:02:28.017

00:02:28.018 --> 00:02:28.817
- Jace.

48
00:02:33.072 --> 00:02:34.127
- How do you know Amy?

49
00:02:35.738 --> 00:02:38.528
- Ah, she's a regular at La Mar.

50
00:02:38.529 --> 00:02:39.952
- You own a restaurant?

51
00:02:39.953 --> 00:02:41.802
- (chuckles) No, I'm a server.

52
00:02:43.303 --> 00:02:45.558
- [Bridget] (moaning) I'm gonna cum.

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:47.403
- [Jace] Ah, ah, me too.

58
00:03:04.368 --> 00:03:05.765
- Hey, I think you
might be on your period.


59
00:03:05.766 --> 00:03:07.197
There's a little bit of blood.

60
00:03:10.513 --> 00:03:11.983
A lot of blood.

61
00:03:15.279 --> 00:03:16.758
I'll get, I'll take care
of pillows if you wanna--


62
00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:18.664
- Yeah, I'll do all of this stuff.

63
00:03:18.665 --> 00:03:20.893
I think maybe just let's try not to.

64
00:03:21.802 --> 00:03:25.262
(sighs) Ah, you, you
have some on your face.


65
00:03:25.263 --> 00:03:27.211
- Really, where, ah?

66
00:03:27.212 --> 00:03:28.010
- [Bridget] Like right across here.

67
00:03:28.011 --> 00:03:28.887
- High up?

68
00:03:28.888 --> 00:03:30.033
- Like right here and right here.

69
00:03:30.034 --> 00:03:30.832
- [Jace] On this side?

70
00:03:30.833 --> 00:03:31.631
Oh damn, everywhere.

71
00:03:31.632 --> 00:03:33.066
- Oh, it's on your hand too.

72
00:03:33.067 --> 00:03:34.473
- Oh, yeah, okay.

73
00:03:35.448 --> 00:03:36.246
- I don't think ah,

74
00:03:36.247 --> 00:03:39.101
I'd had started when you
were going down on me.


75
00:03:39.102 --> 00:03:41.249
- Yeah, I didn't, I, 
I couldn't tell.

76
00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.750
Ah, you tasted ah, normal, I'd say.

77
00:03:44.751 --> 00:03:45.548
- Oh, good.

78
00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:46.601
- [Jace] Mm hmm, um.

79
00:03:46.602 --> 00:03:48.509
- I know that
some guys are into this.

80
00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.657
They call themselves bloodhounds.

81
00:03:50.658 --> 00:03:55.016
- Oh, I'm not
a bloodhound, I would say.

82
00:03:55.017 --> 00:03:55.815
(both chuckle)

83
00:03:55.816 --> 00:03:58.215
I mean sex on your period,
I'm totally cool with.


84
00:03:58.216 --> 00:03:59.816
- Sure, I mean normally
I just put a towel down.


85
00:03:59.817 --> 00:04:02.188
- Yeah, just like ah,
you know, clean up after.


86
00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:04.461
- [Bridget] It's really hard
to take anything seriously--


87
00:04:04.462 --> 00:04:05.277
- (chuckles) I'm sorry.

88
00:04:05.278 --> 00:04:06.076
- [Bridget] With this much blood on you.

89
00:04:06.077 --> 00:04:07.379
- I swear to
you I'm not a bloodhound.

- Shit.

93
00:04:18.051 --> 00:04:18.849

94
00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:19.994
- Ah, you gotta go.

95
00:04:19.995 --> 00:04:21.960
- [Jace] Oh, okay, why?

96
00:04:21.961 --> 00:04:23.293
- I have a job interview.

97
00:04:23.294 --> 00:04:24.444
- [Jace] What for, oh.

98
00:04:24.445 --> 00:04:25.254
- To be a nanny.

99
00:04:27.085 --> 00:04:28.910
- Okay, you must really like kids.

100
00:04:28.911 --> 00:04:29.916

- [Bridget] Mm hmm.

118
00:06:05.173 --> 00:06:08.855
- So, you'd start in June when
Franny gets off for school,


119
00:06:08.856 --> 00:06:11.294
and in August we'd set you free again.

120
00:06:11.295 --> 00:06:12.614
- Yep, I wouldn't be here very much.

121
00:06:12.615 --> 00:06:14.101
My firm doesn't give maternity leave

123
00:06:16.336 --> 00:06:17.860
- I'll be working a little from home,

124
00:06:17.861 --> 00:06:20.526
but our doctor says I should
build in extra rest time


125
00:06:20.527 --> 00:06:22.132
because of my age.

126
00:06:23.203 --> 00:06:25.130
I have a geriatric pregnancy.

127
00:06:25.131 --> 00:06:28.352
If you're over 35 that's the medical name.

128
00:06:28.353 --> 00:06:32.310
- No doubt coined by an
actual geriatric white man.

00:06:32.311 --> 00:06:34.039
(both laughing)

130
00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.309
Have you nannied before?

131
00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:38.806
- Not full-time yet.

132
00:06:38.807 --> 00:06:41.635
I've babysitted, sat.

133
00:06:41.636 --> 00:06:43.745
- Ah, Dana mentioned you had siblings.

134
00:06:43.746 --> 00:06:44.924
- Yeah, I have a younger brother.

135
00:06:44.925 --> 00:06:46.545
He's six years younger.

136
00:06:46.546 --> 00:06:50.353
- Oh, that'll be the age
difference for Franny and Wally.


137
00:06:50.354 --> 00:06:51.906
We were worried that it might be

138
00:06:51.907 --> 00:06:54.831
too far apart for them to be friends.

139
00:06:54.832 --> 00:06:56.414
- Are you close with your brother?

140
00:06:56.415 --> 00:06:57.281
- Not really.

141
00:06:58.381 --> 00:07:01.669
No, he has like a job, and a
house, and is very responsible.


142
00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:03.109
We don't have a lot in common.

143
00:07:07.156 --> 00:07:09.362
- Did you have a tough
time finding the house?


144
00:07:24.687 --> 00:07:25.934
- You creeped out by that?

145
00:07:27.161 --> 00:07:27.960
I am.

146
00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:31.995
- [Maya] You Catholic?

147
00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:35.667
- Fallen, I went to Immaculate Conception

148
00:07:35.668 --> 00:07:37.595
from kindergarten to eighth grade.

149
00:07:37.596 --> 00:07:39.455
- Maya wanted Franny to
go to Catholic school,


150
00:07:39.456 --> 00:07:41.421
but I put my foot down.

151
00:07:41.422 --> 00:07:42.409
- That's probably a good idea

152
00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:44.302
if you want her
not to hate the church.

153
00:07:46.505 --> 00:07:48.167
I'm just, I don't hate it.

154
00:07:55.328 --> 00:07:57.058
- I wonder where Franny is?

155
00:07:58.503 --> 00:08:01.140
(birds chirping)

156
00:08:24.838 --> 00:08:25.637
- Hello.

157
00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:27.929
- Hello.

158
00:08:30.468 --> 00:08:31.759
- Did I win?

159
00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:33.518
- Did my mom help you?

160
00:08:36.006 --> 00:08:40.801
- No.

161
00:08:49.738 --> 00:08:51.614
- Just gonna give you a few minutes

162
00:08:51.615 --> 00:08:52.678
to get to know each other.

163
00:08:52.679 --> 00:08:54.244
- I actually can't stay long.

164
00:08:54.245 --> 00:08:55.044
- Okay.

165
00:09:01.924 --> 00:09:04.618
- Dana told me lots of
nice things about you.


166
00:09:04.619 --> 00:09:05.547
- Is Dana coming?

167
00:09:06.374 --> 00:09:08.717
- No, she moved when she
had her baby, remember?


168
00:09:09.932 --> 00:09:11.034
But she's my best friend,

169
00:09:11.035 --> 00:09:11.849
and she thought that you and I

170
00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:13.193
would get along really well.

171
00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:27.195
Hello, Frances, no, I
don't know any Frances.


172
00:09:28.144 --> 00:09:31.897
No, I don't, I don't think
there's a Frances here, is there?


173
00:09:34.683 --> 00:09:36.174
Let me try, Frances!

174
00:09:38.953 --> 00:09:41.267
Franny, you have a very important call.

175
00:09:44.467 --> 00:09:46.423
I'm not even sure she can
understand me right now.


176
00:09:46.424 --> 00:09:48.124
Here, do you wanna
try to talk to her?

177
00:09:49.099 --> 00:09:50.387
Okay, here's Frances.

178
00:09:58.251 --> 00:09:59.849
You see what I mean?

179
00:10:01.998 --> 00:10:02.797
- We're done.

180
00:10:05.728 --> 00:10:10.523
♪ Ooh, la la la
la la la la la ♪

181
00:10:12.567 --> 00:10:17.362
♪ Ooh, la la la
la la la la la ♪

182
00:10:19.883 --> 00:10:22.540
♪ Ooh, la la la
la la la la la ♪

183
00:10:22.541 --> 00:10:23.959
- [Bridget] I'm not gonna get it.

184
00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:24.758
- [Dana] Why?

185
00:10:24.759 --> 00:10:26.136
- [Bridget] Because I was honest.

186
00:10:26.137 --> 00:10:28.333
Should've just lied and
said that I love kids,


187
00:10:28.334 --> 00:10:29.656
and I'm CPR certified.

188
00:10:29.657 --> 00:10:30.634
- [Dana] Oh, my God.

189
00:10:30.635 --> 00:10:31.433
- What?

190
00:10:31.434 --> 00:10:32.640
- [Dana] The pee-pee teepee worked,

191
00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:35.151
and now you can't spray pee-pee

192
00:10:35.152 --> 00:10:37.885
into mommy's face anymore, can you?

193
00:10:37.886 --> 00:10:40.100
Did you run into any Northwestern people?

194
00:10:40.101 --> 00:10:41.472
- No, why?

195
00:10:41.473 --> 00:10:43.370
- [Dana] Be ready, that
neighborhood's crawling


196
00:10:43.371 --> 00:10:44.397
with people we went to school with.

197
00:10:44.398 --> 00:10:45.787
- [Bridget] You went to school with.

198
00:10:45.788 --> 00:10:47.235
- [Dana] You were there for a year.

199
00:10:47.236 --> 00:10:48.147
- It doesn't count.

200
00:10:49.093 --> 00:10:49.921
(baby cooing)

201
00:10:49.922 --> 00:10:50.736
- [Dana] Oh, my God!

202
00:10:50.737 --> 00:10:51.647
- What?

203
00:10:51.648 --> 00:10:53.095
- [Dana] He just smiled.

204
00:10:53.096 --> 00:10:55.477
It couldn't be gas, but can you smile.

205
00:10:56.579 --> 00:10:58.638
Can you smile for momma and Bridget?

206
00:10:58.639 --> 00:10:59.597
- I can't see him.

207
00:10:59.598 --> 00:11:00.950
- [Dana] Let me get it on video.

208
00:11:00.951 --> 00:11:02.599
- Oh, film it later.

209
00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:04.095
- [Dana] I don't know
if he'll do it again.


210
00:11:04.096 --> 00:11:04.968
- Ever?

211
00:11:04.969 --> 00:11:06.701
- [Dana] I gotta go.

212
00:11:06.702 --> 00:11:09.659
(light guitar music)

213
00:11:16.492 --> 00:11:19.129
(birds chirping)

214
00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:30.316
(patrons chattering)

215
00:11:33.147 --> 00:11:33.944
- Ow!

216
00:11:33.945 --> 00:11:34.744
- [Man] Sorry.

217
00:11:42.022 --> 00:11:44.739
(cellphone rings)

218
00:11:45.802 --> 00:11:48.631
- [Maya] Hi, Bridget,
this is Maya Rodriguez.


219
00:11:49.584 --> 00:11:53.227
Um, Annie and I were wondering

220
00:11:53.228 --> 00:11:56.165
if you might still be available
for the summer position?


221
00:12:05.379 --> 00:12:06.692
- [Man] Where you going?

222
00:12:06.693 --> 00:12:08.130
- You're an absolute lifesaver.

223
00:12:08.131 --> 00:12:11.976
Now, the woman we hired came
with tons of experience,


224
00:12:11.977 --> 00:12:16.772
and recommendations, but she
was older and very rigid,


225
00:12:17.904 --> 00:12:20.166
and she had trouble
keeping up with Franny,


226
00:12:20.167 --> 00:12:22.628
and Franny was coming
home even more wound up,


227
00:12:22.629 --> 00:12:25.256
and so I was left with
a wild six year old,


228
00:12:25.257 --> 00:12:27.417
and a screaming baby till
Annie got home at eight,


229
00:12:27.418 --> 00:12:30.064
and I thought I
was gonna lose my mind

230
00:12:30.065 --> 00:12:31.963
if I had to
go another week like that.

231
00:12:31.964 --> 00:12:34.245
So ah, we let her go.

232
00:12:34.246 --> 00:12:35.348
Well, Annie did.

233
00:12:35.349 --> 00:12:36.349
I couldn't do it.

234
00:12:37.603 --> 00:12:38.983
- This is Wally?

235
00:12:38.984 --> 00:12:41.557
- Ah, Wallace Francisco Rodriguez Paulsen.

236
00:12:43.204 --> 00:12:44.718
(Wally cooing)

237
00:12:44.719 --> 00:12:45.830
- Wow.

238
00:12:45.831 --> 00:12:49.095
- I know and he'll get another
name when he's confirmed.


239
00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:51.822
Okay, we gotta go.

240
00:12:52.862 --> 00:12:53.813
Good job, yeah.

241
00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:57.188
You're gonna crawl soon, yeah.

242
00:12:57.189 --> 00:13:01.169
I gotta do it
when he's nice and sleepy.

243
00:13:02.666 --> 00:13:06.885
Oh, I, I ah,
my keys are here somewhere.

244
00:13:08.016 --> 00:13:10.664
Okay, um, would you mind
watching Wally for me?


245
00:13:12.627 --> 00:13:13.426
- Sure.

246
00:13:18.841 --> 00:13:19.640
Hey.

247
00:13:21.681 --> 00:13:22.653
(Wally cooing)

248
00:13:22.654 --> 00:13:23.637
- Uh, found them.

249
00:13:26.399 --> 00:13:27.214
- Where's Franny?

250
00:13:29.276 --> 00:13:30.103
- It's quiet.

251
00:13:38.655 --> 00:13:40.077
- I apologize.

252
00:13:41.053 --> 00:13:42.883
- Do you know how
to get to the park?

253
00:13:42.884 --> 00:13:44.802
I don't trust Franny to guide you.

254
00:13:44.803 --> 00:13:45.922
- I apologize.

255
00:13:47.545 --> 00:13:49.088
- [Bridget] I can look
it up on my phone.

256
00:13:49.089 --> 00:13:51.490
- Ah, for snacks, no sugar.

257
00:13:54.062 --> 00:13:55.086
- Bye, Mommy.

258
00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:58.798
(door thuds)

259
00:14:05.614 --> 00:14:07.055
- I'm Bridget, remember me?

260
00:14:10.021 --> 00:14:10.818
(Franny grunts)

261
00:14:10.819 --> 00:14:12.260
Hey, hey!

262
00:14:13.704 --> 00:14:15.270
Do you know how to open this?

263
00:14:15.271 --> 00:14:16.069
- I can walk.

264
00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:17.764
- Your mom wanted us to bring it.

265
00:14:17.765 --> 00:14:18.563
- It's for the baby.

266
00:14:18.564 --> 00:14:19.464
Leave it on the porch.

267
00:14:19.465 --> 00:14:21.044
- I don't want anyone to steal it.

268
00:14:21.045 --> 00:14:23.589
- They won't, crime
rate's really low here.


269
00:14:25.984 --> 00:14:26.783
- Hey!

270
00:14:32.428 --> 00:14:33.927
So, what's your favorite color?

271
00:14:35.411 --> 00:14:36.782
Hey, slow down.

272
00:14:36.783 --> 00:14:38.546
- How old are you?

273
00:14:38.547 --> 00:14:40.320
- How old do you think I am?

274
00:14:40.321 --> 00:14:41.120
- 52.

275
00:14:42.968 --> 00:14:44.628
- Why do you think that?

276
00:14:44.629 --> 00:14:46.299
- Because that's how old Linda was,

277
00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:47.738
and she was as slow as you.

278
00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:49.800
- I'm 34.

279
00:14:51.552 --> 00:14:53.536
- Do you have kids?

280
00:14:53.537 --> 00:14:54.794
- No.

281
00:14:54.795 --> 00:14:55.914
- Are you married?

282
00:14:55.915 --> 00:14:56.714
- No.

283
00:14:57.996 --> 00:14:59.031
- Do you have a boyfriend?

284
00:14:59.032 --> 00:14:59.846
- [Bridget] No.

285
00:14:59.847 --> 00:15:00.911
- A girlfriend?

286
00:15:00.912 --> 00:15:03.376
- No, do you have a
boyfriend or a girlfriend?


287
00:15:03.377 --> 00:15:04.622
- No.

288
00:15:04.623 --> 00:15:06.761
- Then we have something in common.

289
00:15:06.762 --> 00:15:08.894
- I'm tired.

290
00:15:08.895 --> 00:15:10.290
- We just started walking.

291
00:15:10.291 --> 00:15:12.439
- Will you carry me?

292
00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:14.194
- [Bridget] Let's go back
and get the stroller.


293
00:15:14.195 --> 00:15:17.387
- No, we're almost there.

294
00:15:17.388 --> 00:15:19.559
It won't take long if you carry me.

295
00:15:21.109 --> 00:15:22.589
- The park is really close?

296
00:15:27.717 --> 00:15:28.875
Come on.

297
00:15:28.876 --> 00:15:31.832
(light guitar music)

298
00:15:34.049 --> 00:15:36.073
- You're sweaty.

299
00:15:36.074 --> 00:15:39.031
(light guitar music)

300
00:15:58.456 --> 00:16:02.453
(children screaming and laughing)

301
00:16:14.182 --> 00:16:15.622
Can I have some money?

302
00:16:15.623 --> 00:16:16.799
- Your mom said no sugar.

303
00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:17.598
- Please?

304
00:16:17.599 --> 00:16:20.117
- We can get an apple or
something on the way home.


305
00:16:20.118 --> 00:16:20.917
- Hmm.

306
00:16:22.193 --> 00:16:24.399
Help, she's not my mom!

307
00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:26.093
I don't know her!

308
00:16:26.094 --> 00:16:27.932
Help, she's not my mom!

309
00:16:29.146 --> 00:16:30.984
I don't know her, help!

310
00:16:34.207 --> 00:16:37.005
(doorbell ringing)

311
00:16:41.582 --> 00:16:44.564
- Frances started crying and
then Maya started crying,


312
00:16:44.565 --> 00:16:46.233
and Maya came back with even more money,

313
00:16:46.234 --> 00:16:48.346
and told me to take the
rest of the day off.


314
00:16:49.791 --> 00:16:50.589
Like that?

315
00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:51.467
- [Jace] (chuckles) Wow.

316
00:16:51.468 --> 00:16:52.613
- Uh huh, that's for you.

317
00:16:52.614 --> 00:16:53.412
(Jace laughing)

318
00:16:53.413 --> 00:16:54.887
And these are for me.

319
00:16:55.795 --> 00:16:56.627
Yeah, uh huh.

320
00:16:57.771 --> 00:17:02.258
It's sad, because Maya was this funny,

321
00:17:02.259 --> 00:17:03.985
confident, sexy woman,

322
00:17:03.986 --> 00:17:06.248
and now she's just like this,

323
00:17:06.249 --> 00:17:07.955
she's a bare-boobed unshowered,

324
00:17:07.956 --> 00:17:09.819
perpetually crying milk machine.

325
00:17:11.706 --> 00:17:14.183
What about this conversation
is turning you on?


326
00:17:15.139 --> 00:17:18.416
- Unshowered (chuckles).

327
00:17:21.374 --> 00:17:23.213
- [Bridget] Ah (chuckles).

328
00:17:23.214 --> 00:17:24.115
- [Jace] What?

329
00:17:24.116 --> 00:17:27.654
- That's okay, they just swell
up before I get my period.


330
00:17:27.655 --> 00:17:28.454
- I know.

331
00:17:29.554 --> 00:17:30.771
- You know?

332
00:17:30.772 --> 00:17:32.650
- Yeah, I pay attention.

333
00:17:32.651 --> 00:17:34.524
- Do you prefer them like this?

334
00:17:35.586 --> 00:17:37.456
- I like them at all stages (chuckles).

335
00:17:38.673 --> 00:17:39.762
(Bridget groans)

336
00:17:39.763 --> 00:17:40.561
I mean it.

337
00:17:40.562 --> 00:17:41.929
(Bridget groans)

338
00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:45.126
(cash register beeping)

339
00:17:49.026 --> 00:17:51.462
♪ Acting like I don't really see ♪

340
00:17:51.463 --> 00:17:55.610

(Bridget sighs)

346
00:18:24.226 --> 00:18:26.207
- [Bridget] I'm for
sure getting rid of it.


347
00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:29.209
- Okay.

348
00:18:31.498 --> 00:18:32.935
We could talk about other options or--

349
00:18:32.936 --> 00:18:35.496
- No, thanks.

350
00:18:35.497 --> 00:18:36.354
- Yeah, sure.

351
00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:43.610
Do you think maybe your birth control

352
00:18:43.611 --> 00:18:45.134
like malfunctioned or--

353
00:18:45.135 --> 00:18:46.328
- I'm not on birth control.

354
00:18:48.644 --> 00:18:49.460
- You're not?

355
00:18:49.461 --> 00:18:50.390
- No.

356
00:18:50.391 --> 00:18:51.254
- Okay (chuckles).

357
00:18:52.261 --> 00:18:55.185
- I've used this method
for like eight years.


358
00:18:55.186 --> 00:18:56.557
- This method?

359
00:18:56.558 --> 00:18:57.517
- You sure that you.

360
00:18:58.591 --> 00:18:59.389
- [Jace] Pulled out, yeah.

361
00:18:59.390 --> 00:19:00.509
- Every time?

362
00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:01.831
- [Jace] Well, I think so.

363
00:19:01.832 --> 00:19:03.820
- Your sperm are probably super fast.

364
00:19:05.429 --> 00:19:06.227
That's a compliment.

365
00:19:06.228 --> 00:19:09.589
- Thank you, I thank you
so much, appreciate that.


366
00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:10.388
(Jace chuckles)

367
00:19:10.389 --> 00:19:11.968
- God, I honestly thought
I couldn't even get--


368
00:19:11.969 --> 00:19:14.011
- Why did you think that (chuckles)?

369
00:19:14.012 --> 00:19:15.786
- Because it's never happened before.

370
00:19:18.654 --> 00:19:20.178
I hear it.

371
00:19:20.179 --> 00:19:21.524
I hear that how it sounds.

372
00:19:25.578 --> 00:19:27.921
- I'll go with you when you go.

373
00:19:29.184 --> 00:19:29.983
- Okay.

374
00:19:32.224 --> 00:19:33.537
- And I'll pay for it,

375
00:19:33.538 --> 00:19:34.353
- We'll split it.

376
00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:44.297
- Mama said I have
to try and respect you.

377
00:19:47.051 --> 00:19:47.850
- Get in.

378
00:19:53.074 --> 00:19:54.463
- Where are we going?

379
00:19:54.464 --> 00:19:55.625
- The library.

380
00:19:55.626 --> 00:19:57.631
- [Franny] I don't wanna be quiet!

381
00:19:57.632 --> 00:19:59.019
- We'll go to the park afterward.

382
00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:01.560
I just need some quiet time to think.

383
00:20:01.561 --> 00:20:03.028
- [Franny] About your choices?

384
00:20:03.029 --> 00:20:03.828
- What?

385
00:20:04.697 --> 00:20:06.157
- When I'm in timeout,

386
00:20:06.158 --> 00:20:09.306
I'm suppose to think about my choices.

387
00:20:09.307 --> 00:20:11.566
(stroller thuds)

388
00:20:11.567 --> 00:20:12.842
Again!

389
00:20:12.843 --> 00:20:14.405
(stroller thuds)

390
00:20:14.406 --> 00:20:16.198
(Franny giggles)

391
00:20:16.199 --> 00:20:17.024
(stroller thuds)

392
00:20:17.025 --> 00:20:19.662
(Franny giggles)

393
00:20:22.842 --> 00:20:24.377
- [Man] Hey, no running, please.

394
00:20:31.397 --> 00:20:32.489
- Can't you read?

395
00:20:32.490 --> 00:20:34.565
- Hearing it helps my brain development.

396
00:20:38.545 --> 00:20:41.619
- (sighs) Mama, is it springtime yet?

397
00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:42.985
No, it's winter forever.

398
00:20:47.749 --> 00:20:49.368
- You skipped a bunch.

399
00:20:49.369 --> 00:20:50.712
- It's boring until the end.

400
00:20:51.541 --> 00:20:52.579
- Start over.

401
00:20:54.417 --> 00:20:55.296
Start over!

402
00:21:01.127 --> 00:21:03.716
- Do your mom's leave you here
when they go to the bathroom?


403
00:21:03.717 --> 00:21:04.516
- Of course.

404
00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:14.097
(door creaks)

405
00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:25.184
(urine splashing)

406
00:21:25.185 --> 00:21:26.699
- [Child] Mom

407
00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:28.273
- [Woman] Yes?

408
00:21:28.274 --> 00:21:29.485
- [Child] I love you.

409
00:21:29.486 --> 00:21:31.342
- [Woman] I love you too, babe.

410
00:21:31.343 --> 00:21:32.963
Do you feel better?

411
00:21:32.964 --> 00:21:35.282
- [Child] Yeah, a lot better.

412
00:21:37.096 --> 00:21:39.543
- [Children] One, two, three.

413
00:21:39.544 --> 00:21:41.166
- [Boy] You can flip it, Jeffrey.

414
00:21:41.167 --> 00:21:42.580
- Are you on your period?

415
00:21:44.502 --> 00:21:45.301
- Oh, God.

416
00:21:46.995 --> 00:21:49.599
- Cats in boots, cats in
boots, cats in boots, cats!


417
00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:52.107
- Franny, can you be a
little more quiet, please?


418
00:21:52.108 --> 00:21:56.161
- We're outside, so I
can use my outside voice!


419
00:21:56.162 --> 00:21:57.984
(stroller thuds)

420
00:21:57.985 --> 00:21:59.039
Again!

421
00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:00.113
(stroller thuds)

422
00:22:00.114 --> 00:22:01.055
Again.

423
00:22:01.056 --> 00:22:01.854
(stroller thuds)

424
00:22:01.855 --> 00:22:03.697
(giggles) Again.

425
00:22:03.698 --> 00:22:04.514
(stroller thuds)

426
00:22:04.515 --> 00:22:05.313
(Franny screams)

427
00:22:05.314 --> 00:22:06.209
- Shit.

428
00:22:06.210 --> 00:22:08.959
(Franny crying)

429
00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:11.150
- She threw me out of the stroller!

430
00:22:12.144 --> 00:22:13.284
- We went over some bumps,

431
00:22:13.285 --> 00:22:15.379
and I forgot to
buckle her in, I'm sorry.

432
00:22:17.393 --> 00:22:18.448
- Why, it's okay.

433
00:22:19.970 --> 00:22:23.726
(speaking in foreign language)

434
00:22:26.701 --> 00:22:29.179
(Wally crying)

435
00:22:32.796 --> 00:22:34.342
Help Bridget, okay?

436
00:22:34.343 --> 00:22:36.820
(Wally crying)

437
00:22:49.923 --> 00:22:52.879
(light guitar music)

438
00:22:55.025 --> 00:22:55.824
- Soap.

439
00:22:59.043 --> 00:23:00.712
- Okay, how does that feel?

440
00:23:00.713 --> 00:23:01.991
Does that sting?

441
00:23:04.568 --> 00:23:05.527
- Neosporin.

442
00:23:08.031 --> 00:23:10.988
- This might sting just a little bit.

443
00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:15.448
Just a little more, okay.

444
00:23:16.874 --> 00:23:18.552
- [Franny] Band-aids.

445
00:23:21.921 --> 00:23:23.024
- How do they feel now?

446
00:23:24.354 --> 00:23:27.311
(light guitar music)

447
00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:30.878
Last one.

448
00:23:33.582 --> 00:23:36.027
- Where do you want yours?

449
00:23:36.028 --> 00:23:38.985
(light guitar music)

450
00:23:45.511 --> 00:23:46.644
- [Bridget] Thank you.

451
00:23:46.645 --> 00:23:49.203
(lips smacking)

452
00:23:54.073 --> 00:23:56.710
(woman groaning)

453
00:23:58.482 --> 00:23:59.368
- First time?

454
00:24:01.283 --> 00:24:02.082
- What?

455
00:24:02.882 --> 00:24:04.800
- Is that the one where Dumbledore dies?

456
00:24:06.136 --> 00:24:07.698
- Dumbledore dies?

457
00:24:07.699 --> 00:24:08.555
- Bridget D.

458
00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:27.748
(knocking on door)

459
00:24:27.749 --> 00:24:30.139
- [Nurse Tech] Bridget,
hi, so I understand


460
00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:32.710
you're looking to get an abortion.

461
00:24:32.711 --> 00:24:34.910
- Yes, I'm in the market.

462
00:24:35.878 --> 00:24:38.051
- [Nurse Tech] Well, we'll
start with an ultrasound.


463
00:24:38.052 --> 00:24:39.461
- I thought I wouldn't need one.

464
00:24:39.462 --> 00:24:41.524
- We need it to tell
how far along you are.


465
00:24:44.823 --> 00:24:46.850
Don't worry, you don't
have to look at it.

466
00:24:48.964 --> 00:24:51.681
(machine beeping)

467
00:25:01.785 --> 00:25:04.103
You wanna know if it's twins?

468
00:25:06.987 --> 00:25:07.786
- I guess.

469
00:25:09.423 --> 00:25:10.222
- It's not.

470
00:25:13.038 --> 00:25:16.527
Okay, you can sit up now.

471
00:25:16.528 --> 00:25:19.245
(machine beeping)

472
00:25:48.977 --> 00:25:51.775
(shutter clicking)

473
00:25:53.405 --> 00:25:56.282
(cellphone ringing)

474
00:25:57.732 --> 00:25:58.530
- I got it.

475
00:25:58.531 --> 00:25:59.330
- Cool, cool.

476
00:26:02.563 --> 00:26:05.155
- So this is probably gonna get messy.

477
00:26:06.044 --> 00:26:09.294
- I know, I've done some research.

478
00:26:09.295 --> 00:26:10.092
(Bridget chuckles)

479
00:26:10.093 --> 00:26:12.872
And um, I know we've encountered
a little bit of blood


480
00:26:12.873 --> 00:26:13.722
in our relationship before, we just--

481
00:26:13.723 --> 00:26:16.468
- Oh, we're not in a relationship.

482
00:26:16.469 --> 00:26:19.132
- Oh, ah, okay (chuckles).

483
00:26:20.756 --> 00:26:22.625
- It's just that you're 26.

484
00:26:22.626 --> 00:26:23.425
- [Jace] Yeah?

485
00:26:24.303 --> 00:26:26.471
- Well, it's those 26 year old,

486
00:26:26.472 --> 00:26:29.348
young, agile, super in-shape sperm

487
00:26:29.349 --> 00:26:31.889
that got us into
this in the first place.

488
00:26:31.890 --> 00:26:34.316
- And your 34 year old eggs.

489
00:26:34.317 --> 00:26:35.448
I, I just mean that your eggs

490
00:26:35.449 --> 00:26:37.251
are in good shape too, that's all.

491
00:26:37.252 --> 00:26:38.304
- Thank you.

492
00:26:38.305 --> 00:26:39.663
- You're welcome.

493
00:26:43.455 --> 00:26:45.195
- I feel like you should
have to do something.


494
00:26:46.065 --> 00:26:48.912
Like give yourself food
poisoning or something.


495
00:26:48.913 --> 00:26:51.573
- Okay, um, what do we got?

496
00:26:52.730 --> 00:26:55.182
- I think I
have some really old chicken.

497
00:26:55.183 --> 00:26:57.068
- (chuckles) Okay, oh yeah.

498
00:26:58.101 --> 00:26:59.470
I can't tell if you're serious.

499
00:26:59.471 --> 00:27:01.948
(both chuckle)

500
00:27:13.961 --> 00:27:15.785
- I have to keep
them here for 20 minutes.

501
00:27:15.786 --> 00:27:17.367
- [Jace] Cool.

502
00:27:17.368 --> 00:27:19.199
- [Bridget] Do I look cute?

503
00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:20.264
- You look very cute.

504
00:27:22.394 --> 00:27:23.901
- [Bridget] I feel cute.

505
00:27:23.902 --> 00:27:25.570
- [Man On TV] It's a slice.

506
00:27:25.571 --> 00:27:29.340
It's not exactly an
enthusiastic leaf eater.


507
00:27:29.341 --> 00:27:30.978
A couple of half-hearted chews,

508
00:27:30.979 --> 00:27:31.777
and the leaves go straight
down to its stomach.


509
00:27:31.778 --> 00:27:32.577
- Fuck.

510
00:27:34.183 --> 00:27:35.362
(door thuds)

511
00:27:35.363 --> 00:27:36.318
- Everything okay?

512
00:27:36.319 --> 00:27:37.229
- [Bridget] Go into the other room,

513
00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:39.118
and turn the TV up really loud.

514
00:27:39.119 --> 00:27:40.298
- Okay, is there
anything I can get you?

515
00:27:40.299 --> 00:27:42.737
- [Bridget] You can get the
fuck away from the door.


516
00:27:42.738 --> 00:27:43.935
- Okay.

517
00:27:43.936 --> 00:27:47.693
(Bridget gagging and coughing)

518
00:27:49.039 --> 00:27:50.521
Okay, I got this printout here.

519
00:27:50.522 --> 00:27:53.488
Um, caring for yourself after an abortion.

520
00:27:54.371 --> 00:27:58.053
Okay, ah, normal side
effects, bleeding, obviously.


521
00:27:59.134 --> 00:28:00.342
If there's heavy bleeding,

522
00:28:00.343 --> 00:28:03.951
use a heavy maxi-pad
for an hour, in an hour.


523
00:28:03.952 --> 00:28:07.765
Ah, then begin deep uterine
massaging for 10 minutes.


524
00:28:07.766 --> 00:28:10.920
So I could, I could do
that if you need me to.


525
00:28:10.921 --> 00:28:12.253
Do the uterine massage.

526
00:28:12.254 --> 00:28:17.049
Um, take 800 milligrams of
ibuprofen with food or milk.


527
00:28:18.996 --> 00:28:19.794
Do you have any milk?

528
00:28:19.795 --> 00:28:21.294
- [Bridget] Almond milk, does that count?

529
00:28:21.295 --> 00:28:22.908
- No, it has to be dairy.

530
00:28:22.909 --> 00:28:23.972
You're not lactose intolerant, are you?

531
00:28:23.973 --> 00:28:24.771
- [Bridget] Yeah, I am.

532
00:28:24.772 --> 00:28:26.342
- That will also cause cramps it said.

533
00:28:26.343 --> 00:28:27.141
(Bridget giggles)

534
00:28:27.142 --> 00:28:29.765
And then after that apply more
uterine massages frequently.


535
00:28:29.766 --> 00:28:30.935
- [Bridget] What does that mean?

536
00:28:30.936 --> 00:28:32.824
- It's ah, I've actually done that before.

537
00:28:32.825 --> 00:28:35.730
It's ah, they're quite comfortable.

538
00:28:35.731 --> 00:28:38.944
Chapter 14, Felix Felicis.

539
00:28:41.217 --> 00:28:44.337
Harry had herbology first
thing the following morning.


540
00:28:44.338 --> 00:28:46.059
- [Bridget] Do British.

541
00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:49.046
- Harry had herbology first
thing the following morning.


542
00:28:50.347 --> 00:28:52.504
Here's ah, discharge,

543
00:28:52.505 --> 00:28:54.470
ah it may be non-bloody

544
00:28:54.471 --> 00:28:56.809
in range from a
brown to a black color.

545
00:28:56.810 --> 00:28:57.608
- [Bridget] Black?

546
00:28:57.609 --> 00:28:59.994
- [Jace] Yeah, do you wanna
hear the abnormal side effects?


547
00:28:59.995 --> 00:29:00.793
- [Bridget] No.

548
00:29:00.794 --> 00:29:01.592
- [Jace] Okay, awesome.

549
00:29:01.593 --> 00:29:02.391
Prolonged, heavy bleeding.

550
00:29:02.392 --> 00:29:06.097
Ah, if you have blood
clots larger than a lemon,


551
00:29:07.034 --> 00:29:07.832
that would be abnormal.

552
00:29:07.833 --> 00:29:08.631
- [Bridget] I see.

553
00:29:08.632 --> 00:29:11.100
- I wonder if they mean like
an organic lemon, or a--


554
00:29:11.101 --> 00:29:13.382
- (giggles) Yeah, like
genetically a modified lemon.


555
00:29:13.383 --> 00:29:16.710
- A GMO or a lemon would be
larger probably, or presumably.


556
00:29:16.711 --> 00:29:19.299
The weekend's brutal wind
had died out at last.


557
00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:24.096
Chills, fever, nausea, vomiting, fainting.

558
00:29:26.004 --> 00:29:28.784
If the bleeding continues
for more than three hours,


559
00:29:28.785 --> 00:29:29.623
give us a call.

560
00:29:33.222 --> 00:29:34.020
Um--

561
00:29:34.021 --> 00:29:35.900
- [Bridget] What, we're
at like two right now?


562
00:29:35.901 --> 00:29:36.955
- Two hours, yeah.

563
00:29:36.956 --> 00:29:41.752
So if you still, yeah, I,
I, I bet in 15 minutes,


564
00:29:42.008 --> 00:29:43.484
this is all gonna be,
you're gonna be fine.


565
00:29:43.485 --> 00:29:46.202
(Bridget giggles)

566
00:29:50.631 --> 00:29:51.849
- Hey, can I show you something?

567
00:29:51.850 --> 00:29:53.844
It's really gross.

568
00:29:53.845 --> 00:29:54.644
- Yeah, okay.

569
00:29:58.215 --> 00:29:59.286
- Do you think that's it?

570
00:30:00.194 --> 00:30:01.012
- I don't know.

571
00:30:02.208 --> 00:30:03.551
How big is it suppose to be?

572
00:30:05.401 --> 00:30:07.907
- Online it said it's about
the size of a sweet pea.


573
00:30:08.768 --> 00:30:10.877
- [Jace] Like a pod, pea pod?

574
00:30:10.878 --> 00:30:12.971
- Like an individual pea inside the pod.

575
00:30:13.848 --> 00:30:15.355
- [Jace] Oh.

576
00:30:15.356 --> 00:30:16.596
- It's about this size.

577
00:30:19.912 --> 00:30:21.158
There's been a lot of blood though.

578
00:30:21.159 --> 00:30:22.741
So it could just be another clot.

579
00:30:25.273 --> 00:30:27.808
I hate how they compare it
to cute things, you know?


580
00:30:28.981 --> 00:30:31.989
Like a raspberry, a kumquat, a tomatillo.

581
00:30:34.029 --> 00:30:36.283
- When really it's just
the size of a rat turd.

586
00:31:11.403 --> 00:31:12.562
- Mm, hmm, this is Frances.

587
00:31:12.563 --> 00:31:15.027
- Frances, hi, okay, perfect.

588
00:31:15.028 --> 00:31:16.859
Well, you've got a little bit of time

589
00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:18.019
before the class starts,

590
00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:20.186
so if you wanna just go play,

591
00:31:20.187 --> 00:31:22.375
you can do that till you
hear the welcome song.


592
00:31:22.376 --> 00:31:23.783
- Are you gonna stay?

593
00:31:23.784 --> 00:31:26.852
- We encourage parents to stay
and play with their littles.


594
00:31:26.853 --> 00:31:28.731
- I don't know how, so.

595
00:31:28.732 --> 00:31:30.611
- Perfect opportunity to learn.

596
00:31:30.612 --> 00:31:33.451
Don't tell me this old dog
can't learn new tricks.

(all chuckling)

598
00:31:35.417 --> 00:31:36.270
- That sounds fun,

599
00:31:36.271 --> 00:31:38.993
but I have a lot of adult
important stuff to take care of.


600
00:31:38.994 --> 00:31:41.007
But you're gonna have a great
time with Miss Margaret.


601
00:31:41.008 --> 00:31:42.906
- No, no, I'm, 
I'm an administrator.

602
00:31:42.907 --> 00:31:44.076
I'm not an artist.

603
00:31:44.077 --> 00:31:47.887
Your teacher is gonna be
Mr. Isaac right over there.


604
00:31:49.726 --> 00:31:51.950
He's a poet.

605
00:31:51.951 --> 00:31:54.462
We sell several of his
chap books next door.


606
00:31:54.463 --> 00:31:55.704
He's very good.

607
00:31:58.233 --> 00:31:59.556

608
00:32:00.551 --> 00:32:01.349

- I don't know how.

621
00:33:27.404 --> 00:33:28.903
- Your body doesn't yet,

but your heart's been
playing all your life.

Thank you so much, great class.

626
00:33:39.622 --> 00:33:40.945
See ya next week.

627
00:33:40.946 --> 00:33:42.972
Practice, don't forget to practice.

628
00:33:51.838 --> 00:33:53.608
- Did you steal that?

629
00:33:53.609 --> 00:33:55.241
- No, I bought it.

630
00:33:55.242 --> 00:33:56.640
- But you don't have any money.

631
00:33:56.641 --> 00:33:57.439
- Shh.

632
00:33:57.440 --> 00:33:59.717
- I think we got a little
Joan Jett on our hands.


633
00:34:00.865 --> 00:34:01.871
You Frances mom?

634
00:34:01.872 --> 00:34:02.670
- No.

635
00:34:02.671 --> 00:34:03.469
- No.

636
00:34:03.470 --> 00:34:05.212
- No, I just,
I watch her, I'm Bridget.

637
00:34:06.744 --> 00:34:08.758
- Frances showed a natural aptitude today.

638
00:34:09.592 --> 00:34:11.538
Don't tell the other kids,
but I've got a new favorite.


639
00:34:11.539 --> 00:34:14.473
- The strings hurt my fingers today.

640
00:34:14.474 --> 00:34:16.861
- Well, you'll get used to it.

641
00:34:16.862 --> 00:34:18.972
You get calluses and
you won't feel a thing.


642
00:34:20.362 --> 00:34:21.705
Did you get that downstairs?

643
00:34:22.702 --> 00:34:25.137
- I just had them restring it.

644
00:34:25.138 --> 00:34:26.825
- [Isaac] You play?

645
00:34:26.826 --> 00:34:28.638
- Not for years.

646
00:34:28.639 --> 00:34:30.124
- Can we go?

647
00:34:30.125 --> 00:34:31.036
- [Bridget] Mm hmm.

648
00:34:32.012 --> 00:34:33.370
- Will you join us next week?

649
00:34:34.489 --> 00:34:37.158
Once in a lifetime opportunity
to play with Joan Jett.


650
00:34:38.478 --> 00:34:40.885
- Why did he
keep calling me Joan Jett?

651
00:34:40.886 --> 00:34:41.915
- It's a compliment.

652
00:34:43.264 --> 00:34:44.893
- My name is Frances.

653
00:34:44.894 --> 00:34:47.377
- You wanna be Joan Jett, trust me.

654
00:34:47.378 --> 00:34:49.698
She was one of the great rock stars.

655
00:34:49.699 --> 00:34:52.758
Really angry, lots of statement eyeliner.

656
00:34:52.759 --> 00:34:53.957
Wonder if she's dead now?

657
00:34:54.886 --> 00:34:56.498
- Why was she angry?

658
00:34:56.499 --> 00:34:58.310
- Because she was born into a patriarchy

659
00:34:58.311 --> 00:34:59.432
and it effing sucked.

660
00:34:59.433 --> 00:35:01.149
- What's a patriarchy?

661
00:35:01.150 --> 00:35:02.185
- It's where men are in charge,

662
00:35:02.186 --> 00:35:03.864
and women have to do what they say.

663
00:35:09.425 --> 00:35:11.658
- My guitar class is a patriarchy.

00:35:55.959 --> 00:35:56.758
- [Franny] Mama.

678
00:35:59.863 --> 00:36:00.800
- How ya doin'?

679
00:36:00.801 --> 00:36:02.125
- Frances is over.

680
00:36:02.126 --> 00:36:04.283
I'm Joan Jett now.

681
00:36:04.284 --> 00:36:07.010
- Well, Joan, let's
go get you cleaned up.

682
00:36:12.098 --> 00:36:14.352
- It's not coming off.

683
00:36:14.353 --> 00:36:15.599
- I think it's waterproof.

684
00:36:16.406 --> 00:36:18.707
- Did you use your mascara on her?

685
00:36:18.708 --> 00:36:19.973
You really shouldn't have done that,

686
00:36:19.974 --> 00:36:22.470
because Franny had pinkeye this weekend.

687
00:36:23.352 --> 00:36:27.705
- Pinkeye means you
got poop in your eye.

688
00:36:27.706 --> 00:36:28.896
- [Annie] Yes, it does.

689
00:36:30.964 --> 00:36:32.555
- I can never get her to nap.

690
00:36:32.556 --> 00:36:34.180
- I don't give her a choice.

691
00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:41.915
So, you're a fan of The Runaways?

692
00:36:41.916 --> 00:36:44.284
- Yeah, I listened to them
all the time growing up.


693
00:36:44.285 --> 00:36:45.963
- You should look up what
happened to those girls


694
00:36:45.964 --> 00:36:47.546
when they were making that music.

695
00:36:50.385 --> 00:36:54.173
- The Runaways dark side.

696
00:36:55.649 --> 00:36:56.448
Oh, fuck.

697
00:36:59.399 --> 00:37:02.276
(cellphone beeping)

698
00:37:08.844 --> 00:37:11.482
(Bridget grunts)

699
00:37:22.750 --> 00:37:26.826
(children laughing and chattering)

700
00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:28.698
Hi.

701
00:37:28.699 --> 00:37:31.871
- (screams) You look so nice and skinny.

702
00:37:31.872 --> 00:37:32.898
- Mom.

703
00:37:32.899 --> 00:37:35.779
- Oh, sorry, you look so smart.

704
00:37:38.970 --> 00:37:40.983
- Can we slow down?

705
00:37:40.984 --> 00:37:42.920
- When Dad can't
keep up I hike ahead,

706
00:37:42.921 --> 00:37:44.445
then turn around and come back for him.

707
00:37:44.446 --> 00:37:45.864
I get twice the sets.

708
00:37:45.865 --> 00:37:47.892
- I am keeping up just fine.

709
00:37:49.989 --> 00:37:52.907
- No point paying for gym
membership if you don't use it.


710
00:37:54.065 --> 00:37:55.522
I'm already at 7,000.

711
00:37:55.523 --> 00:37:56.845
Dennis, you go ahead.

712
00:37:56.846 --> 00:37:58.428
He needs to stay in the aerobics zone,

713
00:37:58.429 --> 00:37:59.272
otherwise it doesn't help.

714
00:37:59.273 --> 00:38:01.958
- See, Bridget, this is how
I stay in the aerobics zone.


715
00:38:03.928 --> 00:38:05.387
- You don't have to boss
him around like that.


716
00:38:05.388 --> 00:38:07.203
- The doctor said if
he doesn't lose weight,


717
00:38:07.204 --> 00:38:08.478
he'll have a heart attack.

718
00:38:08.479 --> 00:38:11.451
He's been walking on the
treadmill four miles every night.


719
00:38:11.452 --> 00:38:12.727
- [Bridget] That's good.

720
00:38:12.728 --> 00:38:14.127
- I bought him these little gold stars

721
00:38:14.128 --> 00:38:16.093
to put on the calender
each time he does it.


722
00:38:16.094 --> 00:38:18.492
He doesn't go to sleep
until he's gotten his star.


723
00:38:19.911 --> 00:38:22.078
- Is he still retiring next year?

724
00:38:22.079 --> 00:38:24.235
- We're learning Spanish.

725
00:38:24.236 --> 00:38:25.703
(speaking in foreign language)

726
00:38:25.704 --> 00:38:28.762
And we'll have time to
visit you more often.


727
00:38:28.763 --> 00:38:30.703
Be nice if there was a reason to.

728
00:38:32.513 --> 00:38:35.053
I saw on Facebook that
Jill Stafford is pregnant.


729
00:38:35.054 --> 00:38:36.559
- Please stop friending my friends.

730
00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:38.276
- I'm trying to see
what's going on with you.


731
00:38:38.277 --> 00:38:39.686
- You can ask
what's going on with me.

732
00:38:39.687 --> 00:38:41.204
- [Carol] She's been
married for awhile now.


733
00:38:41.205 --> 00:38:43.455
I started to wonder if
there was something wrong.


734
00:38:43.456 --> 00:38:45.267
It's a risk waiting that late.

735
00:38:45.268 --> 00:38:47.041
- She's my age.

736
00:38:47.042 --> 00:38:47.870
- Exactly.

737
00:38:51.013 --> 00:38:53.151
I don't think I'd
be a very good mother.

738
00:38:53.152 --> 00:38:54.349
- [Carol] You'd be a great mother.

739
00:38:54.350 --> 00:38:56.219
- What if I was one of
those moms who went crazy,


740
00:38:56.220 --> 00:38:58.003
and drowned her kids in a bathtub.

741
00:38:58.004 --> 00:38:59.787
- Those are the extreme cases.

742
00:38:59.788 --> 00:39:01.974
It usually doesn't get that far.

743
00:39:01.975 --> 00:39:05.608
When you were a baby and
you screamed and screamed,


744
00:39:05.609 --> 00:39:08.313
and there was nothing I
could do to get you to stop,


745
00:39:08.314 --> 00:39:11.027
I'd imagine taking you by the ankles,

746
00:39:11.028 --> 00:39:13.954
and swinging your little head

747
00:39:13.955 --> 00:39:16.398
into the head into
the wall over and over

748
00:39:16.399 --> 00:39:18.661
until it was a bloody pulp.

749
00:39:18.662 --> 00:39:20.378
- Oh, my God.

750
00:39:20.379 --> 00:39:21.819
- But then I'd feel so
guilty from imagining it,


751
00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:23.494
I wouldn't actually do it.

752
00:39:23.495 --> 00:39:25.729
- I don't know that you
should tell that story.


753
00:39:25.730 --> 00:39:29.594
- It's the truth and women
should talk about it more often.


754
00:39:29.595 --> 00:39:30.650
Wouldn't be as lonely.

755
00:39:32.021 --> 00:39:33.843
- I think it's immoral to have children.

756
00:39:33.844 --> 00:39:35.540
- Immoral to have children?

757
00:39:35.541 --> 00:39:38.177
- Yes, with climate change
and school shootings,


758
00:39:38.178 --> 00:39:39.501
and possible nuclear war,

759
00:39:39.502 --> 00:39:42.397
it's, it's bringing them into
a world that's inhospitable.


760
00:39:42.398 --> 00:39:45.543
- Oh, please, the world has
always been inhospitable.


761
00:39:45.544 --> 00:39:48.142
When I got pregnant with
you, it was the 80s.


762
00:39:48.143 --> 00:39:51.757
Every day Reagan joked
about nuking Russia,


763
00:39:51.758 --> 00:39:52.774
but we survived.

764
00:39:52.775 --> 00:39:55.143
I gambled on our survival.

765
00:39:55.144 --> 00:39:57.118
That's what having kids is.

766
00:39:57.119 --> 00:39:58.375
- [Bridget] That's reckless.

767
00:39:58.376 --> 00:39:59.203
- That's optimistic.

768
00:40:02.442 --> 00:40:04.658
Are you glad you were born?

769
00:40:04.659 --> 00:40:05.961
- I don't know.

770
00:40:05.962 --> 00:40:07.044
- Now see, that's lazy.

771
00:40:07.045 --> 00:40:08.905
I expected that when you were a teenager,

772
00:40:08.906 --> 00:40:11.619
but you're an adult with a
fully formed prefrontal cortex.


773
00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:13.081
Actually think about it.

774
00:40:14.037 --> 00:40:16.504
I know you didn't ask to be,

775
00:40:17.336 --> 00:40:21.094
but if you had the choice
to never exist at all,


776
00:40:21.095 --> 00:40:24.733
or to have the exact
life you're having now,


777
00:40:26.008 --> 00:40:27.590
would you have chosen to be born?

778
00:40:35.011 --> 00:40:38.783
And when you have kids, they'll
be glad they were born too.


779
00:40:40.700 --> 00:40:42.059
- Mom, it's okay.

780
00:40:45.256 --> 00:40:46.751
- I just love you kids so much.

781
00:40:46.752 --> 00:40:48.190
- We love you too.

782
00:40:49.231 --> 00:40:51.548
I'm thinking of freezing my eggs.

783
00:40:52.726 --> 00:40:54.972
- [Carol] (scoffs) You
could never afford that.


784
00:40:56.906 --> 00:40:58.507
Can I give you one more hug?

785
00:40:58.508 --> 00:40:59.675
- You don't have to ask.

786
00:41:08.865 --> 00:41:09.856
I love you, Dad.

787
00:41:13.619 --> 00:41:15.458
- Get your oil changed.

788
00:41:20.492 --> 00:41:21.342
- [Carol] Bye.

789
00:41:21.343 --> 00:41:24.860
- [Bridget] (chuckles) Bye.

790
00:41:38.293 --> 00:41:41.433
- Don't, yeah, no, you should've heard it.

791
00:41:41.434 --> 00:41:42.427
I'm not joking.

792
00:41:42.428 --> 00:41:47.223
- (laughing) I think you're fragile.

793
00:41:48.438 --> 00:41:49.777
- I need to go to the bathroom.

794
00:41:49.778 --> 00:41:51.033
- Okay, go ahead and go.

795
00:41:51.034 --> 00:41:52.547
I'll meet you out front.

796
00:41:52.548 --> 00:41:54.360
- You're supposed to come with me.

797
00:41:54.361 --> 00:41:55.159
- You're not a baby.

798
00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:57.651
You can go to the
bathroom by yourself, go.


799
00:41:57.652 --> 00:42:00.209
(Franny grunts)

800
00:42:02.072 --> 00:42:03.653
- Joan quit the band?

801
00:42:03.654 --> 00:42:06.378
- I think she's testing boundaries.

802
00:42:06.379 --> 00:42:07.580
- She's probably jealous,

803
00:42:08.641 --> 00:42:09.882
because I got a new favorite.

804
00:42:10.973 --> 00:42:13.609
- Oh yeah, Donna's pretty inspiring

805
00:42:13.610 --> 00:42:15.291
picking up a new hobby at 50.

806
00:42:16.756 --> 00:42:18.347
- Donna's a plebe.

807
00:42:18.348 --> 00:42:19.306
She's a lost cause.

808
00:42:19.307 --> 00:42:20.457
She probably always was.

809
00:42:23.124 --> 00:42:24.082
- I was gonna ask,

810
00:42:24.083 --> 00:42:27.030
I don't know if you teach private lessons.

811
00:42:28.264 --> 00:42:29.140
- Usually I don't,

812
00:42:32.465 --> 00:42:34.286
but I could maybe make an exception,

813
00:42:34.287 --> 00:42:36.668
if you think we
might be a good fit.

814
00:42:40.827 --> 00:42:45.347
- Hey, you were supposed to wait inside.

815
00:42:45.348 --> 00:42:46.773
- You said outside.

816
00:42:46.774 --> 00:42:47.818
- Outside the bathrooms.

817
00:42:47.819 --> 00:42:50.685
You can't wait outside by yourself.

818
00:42:50.686 --> 00:42:52.114
This was really expensive.

819
00:42:52.115 --> 00:42:53.458
You have to take care of it.

820
00:42:54.945 --> 00:42:56.468
- I don't even like it.

821
00:42:56.469 --> 00:42:58.479
- You don't know the things you like.

822
00:42:58.480 --> 00:42:59.566
- I know the things I like.

823
00:42:59.567 --> 00:43:03.076
- No, it takes a long time
to figure that stuff out.


824
00:43:03.077 --> 00:43:04.265
- I like reading.

825
00:43:04.266 --> 00:43:05.781
I like ice skating.

826
00:43:05.782 --> 00:43:06.701
- Well, you're not gonna grow up

827
00:43:06.702 --> 00:43:08.840
to be a professional ice skater.

828
00:43:08.841 --> 00:43:09.639
- Why not?

829
00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:11.084
- Because that's really hard.

830
00:43:11.085 --> 00:43:12.808
Like three people out of
a million get to do that,


831
00:43:12.809 --> 00:43:14.681
and you're probably not
gonna be good enough.


832
00:43:14.682 --> 00:43:17.204
- Well, you're not good at anything!

833
00:43:18.326 --> 00:43:19.163
- Get in the car.

834
00:43:21.970 --> 00:43:22.769
Now!

835
00:43:25.029 --> 00:43:28.066
(lively guitar music)

836
00:43:39.259 --> 00:43:41.254
(Franny grunts loudly)

837
00:43:41.255 --> 00:43:42.053
Don't eat too much.

838
00:43:42.054 --> 00:43:43.795
I'm making you lunch.

839
00:43:43.796 --> 00:43:46.833
(lively guitar music)

840
00:43:49.425 --> 00:43:50.224
Shit.

841
00:44:18.503 --> 00:44:20.581
- Is this underwear blood!

842
00:44:21.631 --> 00:44:22.847
- Franny!

843
00:44:22.848 --> 00:44:25.378
- Bridget's still on her period.

844
00:44:25.379 --> 00:44:26.178
- Oh.

845
00:44:27.895 --> 00:44:29.198
I am so sorry.

846
00:44:29.199 --> 00:44:30.819
- No, I'm sorry.

847
00:44:30.820 --> 00:44:31.855
That's really gross.

848
00:44:31.856 --> 00:44:33.019
- No, you're, it's fine.

849
00:44:34.157 --> 00:44:38.121
Honey, you have to let people
have their privacy, remember?


850
00:44:41.427 --> 00:44:43.290
- You're on your period a lot.

851
00:44:44.102 --> 00:44:46.278
Mommy uses tampons,

852
00:44:46.279 --> 00:44:49.395
but mama uses a clear cup,

853
00:44:49.396 --> 00:44:53.264
which is more better and
natural for the environment.


854
00:44:55.189 --> 00:44:59.369
I have to find something
most comfortable for my body,


855
00:44:59.370 --> 00:45:01.589
'cause every woman's body is different.

856
00:45:04.779 --> 00:45:06.721
Bless us, Oh Lord, for these our gifts,

857
00:45:06.722 --> 00:45:08.260
which we are about to receive

858
00:45:08.261 --> 00:45:10.562
from thy bounty, through
Christ, Our Lord, amen.


859
00:45:14.157 --> 00:45:16.634
(Wally crying)

860
00:45:22.940 --> 00:45:24.579
- I got him.

861
00:45:24.580 --> 00:45:26.111
- [Maya] Oh, are you sure?

862
00:45:26.112 --> 00:45:27.135
- It's fine.

863
00:45:27.136 --> 00:45:29.613
(Wally crying)

864
00:45:45.791 --> 00:45:47.089
- I think he likes you.

865
00:45:48.646 --> 00:45:51.689
Whenever I hold him, he cries.

866
00:45:53.144 --> 00:45:55.780
- I can take him for awhile
if you wanna take a nap.


867
00:45:55.781 --> 00:45:57.664
- Oh, no, no, no, I'm fine.

868
00:46:03.123 --> 00:46:05.600
(Wally crying)

869
00:46:26.932 --> 00:46:29.409
(upbeat music)

870
00:46:31.911 --> 00:46:35.091
- [Chad] I need healing, I need
healing, I need healing now.


871
00:46:35.092 --> 00:46:36.769
Someone heal me, someone heal me.

872
00:46:36.770 --> 00:46:39.774
♪ I'm gonna kiss you
in a special way ♪

873
00:46:39.775 --> 00:46:44.570
- Do ya, Justin, get
back, Justin, stay back!


874
00:46:44.708 --> 00:46:47.002
(wall rumbling)

875
00:46:47.003 --> 00:46:49.227
Hold, hold, let him run
out, let him run out,


876
00:46:49.228 --> 00:46:50.666
let him run out, let him
run out, let him run,


877
00:46:50.667 --> 00:46:52.818
let him, let him run out.

878
00:46:52.819 --> 00:46:56.363
(Chad grunts loudly)

879
00:46:56.364 --> 00:46:59.857
Fuck off, fuck off, are
you kidding, fuck off!


880
00:47:12.130 --> 00:47:13.041
- You feeling okay?

881
00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:14.835
- Yeah, I'm fine.

882
00:47:18.124 --> 00:47:19.419
- Can I read you something?

883
00:47:21.404 --> 00:47:22.203
- Okay.

884
00:47:27.516 --> 00:47:28.475
What's that?

885
00:47:29.594 --> 00:47:31.132
- My emotions journal.

886
00:47:32.702 --> 00:47:34.236
It helps me to write stuff down.

887
00:47:39.789 --> 00:47:44.056
We never discussed the emotional
impact of what happened,


888
00:47:44.057 --> 00:47:45.686
and I'm starting to realize

889
00:47:45.687 --> 00:47:49.033
I have some unprocessed feelings.

890
00:47:49.034 --> 00:47:50.596
I know we made the right choice,

891
00:47:50.597 --> 00:47:52.332
but I think I might have some

892
00:47:52.333 --> 00:47:54.596
residual sadness about our loss.

893
00:47:54.597 --> 00:47:58.340
- Oh, no, I don't feel a loss.

894
00:47:59.823 --> 00:48:00.881
Don't put that on me.

895
00:48:02.469 --> 00:48:05.015
- Okay, my loss.

896
00:48:07.227 --> 00:48:11.005
Chad told me you can only
lose what you cling to.


897
00:48:11.006 --> 00:48:15.397
- Wait, you told Chad?

898
00:48:15.398 --> 00:48:18.724
- Yeah, he's my best
friend and a Buddhist.


899
00:48:18.725 --> 00:48:20.125
- I don't want him to know that.

900
00:48:20.126 --> 00:48:21.055
- Well, he's not gonna judge you.

901
00:48:21.056 --> 00:48:22.484
- He's gonna look at me all weird.

902
00:48:22.485 --> 00:48:25.994
- Well, I needed somebody
to talk to and you won't.


903
00:48:25.995 --> 00:48:27.606
- We've talked.

904
00:48:27.607 --> 00:48:30.358
- Yeah, about the mechanics,
but now about how we feel.


905
00:48:30.359 --> 00:48:34.626
- I shouldn't have to feel
anything about it, right?


906
00:48:34.627 --> 00:48:38.525
- You don't, but if you
did, you could talk to me.


907
00:48:38.526 --> 00:48:40.255
- See, this is why I
shouldn't have even told you.


908
00:48:40.256 --> 00:48:42.035
I should've just dealt with it myself.

909
00:48:42.036 --> 00:48:42.834
- [Jace] That's not fair.

910
00:48:42.835 --> 00:48:43.804
- Because you have all of these feelings.

911
00:48:43.805 --> 00:48:45.271
You're whole millennial generation.

912
00:48:45.272 --> 00:48:46.115
- [Jace] You're a millennial too.

913
00:48:46.116 --> 00:48:47.107
- I'm on the cusp.

914
00:48:48.165 --> 00:48:50.862
(Jace scoffs)

915
00:48:50.863 --> 00:48:52.849
How many pages did you write about this?

916
00:48:55.077 --> 00:48:57.475
- One, two, three, four, five.

917
00:49:01.027 --> 00:49:02.004
Five, six.

918
00:49:02.005 --> 00:49:03.684
- I'm going to sleep.

919
00:49:11.222 --> 00:49:14.099

(children laughing and chattering)

922
00:49:58.323 --> 00:50:01.142
- Shit, oh, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

923
00:50:01.143 --> 00:50:02.509
(knocking on door)

924
00:50:02.510 --> 00:50:03.390
Just a sec!

925
00:50:04.250 --> 00:50:06.008
- All right, no hurry.

926
00:50:07.271 --> 00:50:08.882
- Oh fuck, fuck, fuck.

927
00:50:08.883 --> 00:50:11.253
Where the fuck is the plunger?

928
00:50:11.254 --> 00:50:14.962
- Well, actually, if you
wouldn't mind hurrying.


929
00:50:14.963 --> 00:50:15.762
- Oh fuck.

930
00:50:17.704 --> 00:50:19.334

Oh God.

00:50:26.767 --> 00:50:28.905
- Bridget, where are you going?

934
00:50:28.906 --> 00:50:29.704
- [Bridget] Home.

935
00:50:29.705 --> 00:50:30.673
- Why?

936
00:50:30.674 --> 00:50:32.319
- Because the Buddhist just had to

937
00:50:32.320 --> 00:50:33.710
plunge my bloody toilet water,

938
00:50:33.711 --> 00:50:35.258
and now I have to
go jump off a bridge.

939
00:50:35.259 --> 00:50:36.057
- What (laughing)?

940
00:50:36.058 --> 00:50:37.536
- It's not funny!

941
00:50:37.537 --> 00:50:38.496
- Hey, we cool, bro?

942
00:50:39.369 --> 00:50:40.389
- We're cool, Chad.

943
00:50:45.910 --> 00:50:46.709
- Bridget!

- (chuckles) Did you write that?

948
00:51:18.114 --> 00:51:21.378
- The songs I'm given just arrive.

949
00:51:22.766 --> 00:51:24.684
It's feels weird taking credit for them.

950
00:51:30.850 --> 00:51:35.646
- Oh, I ah, didn't know booze
was allowed during class.


951
00:51:36.576 --> 00:51:38.228
- It is when I'm the teacher.

952
00:51:41.669 --> 00:51:42.703
- Thanks.

953
00:51:42.704 --> 00:51:43.570
Mm hmm.

with something kind of easy


955
00:51:50.070 --> 00:51:51.152
to get you back into it.

- You sure you've played before?

960
00:52:05.922 --> 00:52:08.310
- You know, it feels like
a lifetime ago (giggles).


961
00:52:09.615 --> 00:52:11.018
- Okay, come here.

(cellphone ringing)

963
00:52:39.700 --> 00:52:40.803
So, did you drive here?

964
00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:44.172
- I took a Lyft.

965
00:52:46.087 --> 00:52:46.885
Are you heading north?

966
00:52:46.886 --> 00:52:48.219
I'm just four minutes away.

967
00:52:49.751 --> 00:52:50.549
- I'm south.

968
00:52:52.915 --> 00:52:54.271
So Venmo works for me.

969
00:52:56.732 --> 00:52:59.852
- Right, right, right.

You're a really good teacher.

972
00:53:07.608 --> 00:53:08.455
I learned a lot.

973
00:53:17.141 --> 00:53:19.011
Are you sure you don't wanna come over?

974
00:53:23.068 --> 00:53:26.801
- I want to want to come over.

- Shit!

00:54:02.830 --> 00:54:05.468
(dramatic music)

980
00:54:16.029 --> 00:54:20.696
(Bridget gags)
(dog barking)


981
00:54:20.697 --> 00:54:21.736
Sorry, sorry.

982
00:54:22.693 --> 00:54:24.971
(dramatic music)

983
00:54:24.972 --> 00:54:26.010
Fuckin' shit!

984
00:54:28.592 --> 00:54:31.390
(doorbell ringing)

985
00:54:33.461 --> 00:54:34.809
I am so sorry.

986
00:54:34.810 --> 00:54:36.836
- No, I'll be on
time if I leave now.

987
00:54:36.837 --> 00:54:38.543
- You look terrible.

988
00:54:38.544 --> 00:54:39.790
- I have food poisoning.

989
00:54:39.791 --> 00:54:41.468
- Well, you should've stayed home.

990
00:54:41.469 --> 00:54:42.312
- Oh no, it's okay.

991
00:54:42.313 --> 00:54:44.087
I think it's over now.

992
00:54:44.088 --> 00:54:45.304
- Would you mind watching Wally too?

993
00:54:45.305 --> 00:54:46.215
- [Bridget] Yeah, of course.

994
00:54:46.216 --> 00:54:48.776
- This doctor charges you
for missed appointments


995
00:54:48.777 --> 00:54:50.886
if you're more than two minutes late.

996
00:54:50.887 --> 00:54:54.338
Um, there are bottles
of milk in the fridge.


997
00:54:54.339 --> 00:54:56.335
You could help, okay?

998
00:54:56.336 --> 00:54:57.134
- Bye.

999
00:54:57.135 --> 00:54:58.653
- [Maya] Thank you.

1000
00:55:00.800 --> 00:55:03.277
(Wally crying)

1001
00:55:06.066 --> 00:55:08.091
(light guitar music)

1002
00:55:08.092 --> 00:55:10.086
- Give him to me.

1003
00:55:10.087 --> 00:55:11.397
- Do your moms let you hold him?

1004
00:55:11.398 --> 00:55:13.141
- If I'm gentle.

1005
00:55:13.142 --> 00:55:15.620
(Wally crying)

1006
00:55:17.344 --> 00:55:20.301
(light guitar music)

1007
00:55:22.181 --> 00:55:23.551
- Okay, there you go.

1008
00:55:23.552 --> 00:55:24.731
- Get a book, please.

1009
00:55:30.457 --> 00:55:33.516
- This is a huge
tree and there's a swing.

1010
00:55:34.803 --> 00:55:37.887
We'll have lots of fun here, won't we?

1011
00:55:37.888 --> 00:55:40.629
(light guitar music)

1012
00:55:40.630 --> 00:55:45.426
♪ I'm prepared and we're
only halfway there ♪


1013
00:55:51.154 --> 00:55:55.949
♪ When the sun came down, the
light twisted in your hair ♪


1014
00:56:02.453 --> 00:56:03.251
- [Bridget] Hey.

1015

1016

1017
00:56:41.475 --> 00:56:44.090
(Wally cooing)

1018
00:56:44.091 --> 00:56:46.808
(cellphone dings)

1019
00:57:01.754 --> 00:57:03.876
- Do you have a condom?

1020
00:57:03.877 --> 00:57:06.264
- I really don't like those things.

1021
00:57:06.265 --> 00:57:08.592
- I don't either, but we have to.

1022
00:57:08.593 --> 00:57:10.066
- Aren't you on birth control?

1023
00:57:10.964 --> 00:57:12.363
- No.

1024
00:57:12.364 --> 00:57:14.282
- You should really be on birth control.

1025
00:57:15.098 --> 00:57:16.952
- Or we could just use a condom.

1026
00:57:24.871 --> 00:57:28.228
(Isaac breathing heavily)

1027
00:57:30.349 --> 00:57:31.316
Are you okay?

1028
00:57:31.317 --> 00:57:32.516
- [Isaac] Yeah.

1029
00:57:34.742 --> 00:57:35.540
- We can stop.

1030
00:57:35.541 --> 00:57:36.947
- I don't need to stop.

1031
00:57:39.486 --> 00:57:43.149
- Um, it, it's okay.

1032
00:57:43.150 --> 00:57:44.936
We can talk about it.

1033
00:57:46.168 --> 00:57:47.527
- You're not wet.

1034
00:57:49.269 --> 00:57:50.068
- What?

1035
00:57:51.226 --> 00:57:52.398
- [Isaac] You're not really wet.

1036
00:57:54.351 --> 00:57:56.627
It's, it's actually
kind of painful for me.


1037
00:57:57.641 --> 00:57:59.159
- It's a lubricated condom.

1038
00:58:03.385 --> 00:58:05.703
(lips smack)

1039
00:58:10.664 --> 00:58:13.398
- [Isaac] Ah, you didn't tell
me you were on your period.


1040
00:58:14.779 --> 00:58:15.930
Could've used a warning.

1041
00:58:17.149 --> 00:58:17.947
- Fuck.

1042
00:58:20.274 --> 00:58:22.518
- [Franny] You're slower than Linda.

1043
00:58:22.519 --> 00:58:23.798
- Then go ahead.

1044
00:58:25.591 --> 00:58:26.869
You little shit.

1045
00:58:27.815 --> 00:58:29.184
(water splashes)

1046
00:58:29.185 --> 00:58:30.912
(Franny screaming and crying)

1047
00:58:30.913 --> 00:58:31.712
Franny!

1048
00:58:33.445 --> 00:58:34.690
Franny!

1049
00:58:34.691 --> 00:58:36.288
Oh, are you okay?

1050
00:58:36.289 --> 00:58:37.087
- Is she yours?

1051
00:58:37.088 --> 00:58:38.600
- Yes, don't you ever do that again!

1052
00:58:38.601 --> 00:58:39.399
Do you hear me?

1053
00:58:39.400 --> 00:58:40.652
You have to stay
where I can see you!

1054
00:58:40.653 --> 00:58:41.451
- She's okay.

1055
00:58:41.452 --> 00:58:42.249
- No, she's not okay!

1056
00:58:42.250 --> 00:58:43.913
You scared the shit out of me!

1057
00:58:43.914 --> 00:58:45.567
Don't ever do that again!

1058
00:58:45.568 --> 00:58:48.285
(Bridget gasping)

1059
00:58:51.582 --> 00:58:54.352
Oh God, you okay?

1060
00:58:54.353 --> 00:58:55.150
Here, let me see.

1061
00:58:55.151 --> 00:58:56.721
Are you okay?

1062
00:58:56.722 --> 00:58:57.946
Are you okay?

1063
00:58:57.947 --> 00:58:58.986
I'm so sorry.

1064
00:59:00.345 --> 00:59:01.143
Oh, oh.

1065
00:59:03.155 --> 00:59:05.775
(Bridget spitting)

1066
00:59:05.776 --> 00:59:08.732
(light guitar music)

1067
00:59:29.046 --> 00:59:31.364
(door thuds)

1068
00:59:38.730 --> 00:59:39.528
- [Maya] What happened?

1069
00:59:39.529 --> 00:59:40.328
- She fell in the lake.

1070
00:59:41.514 --> 00:59:42.607
- [Maya] Oh, my God.

1071
00:59:42.608 --> 00:59:44.135
- She was just scared I think.

1072
00:59:55.161 --> 00:59:57.098
She got out of
my sight for a second.

1073
00:59:57.099 --> 00:59:58.114
- You left her alone?

1074
00:59:58.115 --> 00:59:59.246
- No, she went up ahead.

1075
00:59:59.247 --> 01:00:00.045
- Don't blame this on her.

1076
01:00:00.046 --> 01:00:00.972
She's the child.

1077
01:00:00.973 --> 01:00:01.771
- I wasn't.

1078
01:00:01.772 --> 01:00:03.130
- You're the adult, right?

1079
01:00:03.131 --> 01:00:04.722
You have to watch her every second.

1080
01:00:04.723 --> 01:00:05.930
All it takes is a second.

1081
01:00:05.931 --> 01:00:07.254
- I know, I made a mistake.

1082
01:00:07.255 --> 01:00:09.294
- You're not allowed to
make mistakes like that


1083
01:00:09.295 --> 01:00:10.973
when you're a parent.

1084
01:00:12.789 --> 01:00:17.584
- Right, I'm sorry, I
won't let it happen again.


1085
01:00:21.750 --> 01:00:24.840
(air-condition humming)

1086
01:00:24.841 --> 01:00:27.798
(light guitar music)

1087
01:00:29.226 --> 01:00:32.802
(cellphone ringing)

1088
01:00:32.803 --> 01:00:37.518
- [Dana] One, two, three, four (chuckles).

1089
01:00:40.831 --> 01:00:43.146
(Cortland imitating gunfire)

1090
01:00:43.147 --> 01:00:45.682
- Okay, I think you got me.

1091
01:00:45.683 --> 01:00:49.119
(Cortland grunting loudly)

1092
01:00:50.239 --> 01:00:51.725
Did I get the wrong day?

1093
01:00:51.726 --> 01:00:53.548
- We're having an impromptu play date.

1094
01:00:54.977 --> 01:00:56.610
This is our neighbor, Cheryl.

1095
01:00:57.710 --> 01:00:58.716
- Bridget.

1096
01:00:58.717 --> 01:01:00.308
- [Maya] You two know each other?

1097
01:01:00.309 --> 01:01:01.430
- Bridget and I were in the same

1098
01:01:01.431 --> 01:01:03.569
creative writing class at Northwestern.

1099
01:01:03.570 --> 01:01:05.496
- I didn't know you went to Northwestern.

1100
01:01:05.497 --> 01:01:06.295
- Just for a year.

1101
01:01:06.296 --> 01:01:07.501
It doesn't count.

1102
01:01:07.502 --> 01:01:09.217
- Wait, are you in the neighborhood?

1103
01:01:09.218 --> 01:01:10.016
- No.

1104
01:01:10.017 --> 01:01:11.596
- Oh, we all
thought Bridget was gonna be

1105
01:01:11.597 --> 01:01:13.226
the next Sylvia Plath.

1106
01:01:13.227 --> 01:01:14.588
- You're a poet?

1107
01:01:14.589 --> 01:01:16.009
- And severely depressed.

1108
01:01:16.010 --> 01:01:19.278
- (laughing) Well, when
the nanny gets here,


1109
01:01:19.279 --> 01:01:21.186
we should go get some mommy juice.

1110
01:01:21.187 --> 01:01:22.097
- I have to work.

1111
01:01:22.098 --> 01:01:23.450
- Oh, well, call in sick.

1112
01:01:23.451 --> 01:01:25.291
I wanna hear what you've been up to.

1113
01:01:25.292 --> 01:01:27.210
- I don't think
my boss would like that.

1114
01:01:31.046 --> 01:01:31.845
I'm the nanny.

1115
01:01:32.705 --> 01:01:34.671
- [Maya] We couldn't survive without her.

1116
01:01:35.607 --> 01:01:37.046
- That is so great (chuckles).

1117
01:01:37.951 --> 01:01:40.013
Is that like your side
hustle or something?


1118
01:01:42.085 --> 01:01:43.354
- No, this is it.

1119
01:01:46.132 --> 01:01:47.071
- Good for you.

1120
01:01:47.072 --> 01:01:49.200
That, hard to stay sad

1121
01:01:49.201 --> 01:01:50.924
when you're around kids
all day (chuckles).


1122
01:01:52.439 --> 01:01:54.810
(Cortland imitating gunfire)

1123
01:01:54.811 --> 01:01:56.450
- Who's the active shooter?

1124
01:01:56.451 --> 01:01:58.522
- Oh, that's my baby, Cortland.

1125
01:01:58.523 --> 01:02:00.085
He's in love with Franny (chuckles).

1126
01:02:00.086 --> 01:02:01.134
- So he shot her.

1127
01:02:02.637 --> 01:02:04.449
- Would you like some tea?

1128
01:02:04.450 --> 01:02:05.670
- I would love some more.

1129
01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:09.445
- Oh, no, no, I'll, I'll get it.

1130
01:02:09.446 --> 01:02:10.820
- I, I, no, that's fine.

1131
01:02:16.492 --> 01:02:19.064
- [Cheryl] A nanny, good for you.

1132
01:02:19.065 --> 01:02:20.117
- [Maya] I'm sorry?

1133
01:02:20.118 --> 01:02:23.228
- [Cheryl] Well, she is
so much more expensive.


1134
01:02:23.229 --> 01:02:26.580
Is she cheaper because
she doesn't have a degree?


1135
01:02:26.581 --> 01:02:28.808
- [Franny] He broke it.

1136
01:02:28.809 --> 01:02:29.767
- [Cortland] I'm hungry.

1137
01:02:29.768 --> 01:02:30.832
- [Maya] Oh no.

1138
01:02:30.833 --> 01:02:32.778
- Cortland, apologize.

1139
01:02:32.779 --> 01:02:34.371
- I'm hungry!

1140
01:02:34.372 --> 01:02:37.459
- We'll buy you another one, Franny, okay?

1141
01:02:37.460 --> 01:02:40.029
Ah, Bridget, could you
run over to my house,


1142
01:02:40.030 --> 01:02:41.592
and make Cortland something to eat.

1143
01:02:41.593 --> 01:02:43.440
- Oh no, we have snacks here.

1144
01:02:43.441 --> 01:02:45.505
- No, we haven't got our
allergy tests back yet,


1145
01:02:45.506 --> 01:02:47.663
so can't take any risks.

1146
01:02:47.664 --> 01:02:49.025
There's carrots in the refrigerator.

1147
01:02:49.026 --> 01:02:49.824
Just make sure you use

1148
01:02:49.825 --> 01:02:51.577
that fruit and veggie wash by the sink.

1149
01:02:55.394 --> 01:02:56.193
Thanks.

1150
01:02:57.467 --> 01:02:58.985
- Take me with you.

1151
01:03:04.891 --> 01:03:05.689
Be right back.

1152
01:03:05.690 --> 01:03:06.608
- Where you going?

1153
01:03:07.574 --> 01:03:09.079
- To break one of his toys.

1154
01:03:31.327 --> 01:03:33.964
(Bridget scoffs)

1155
01:03:58.656 --> 01:03:59.592
(plate thuds)

1156
01:03:59.593 --> 01:04:00.392
Oopsie.

01:05:32.860 --> 01:05:35.498
(birds chirping)

1163
01:05:38.514 --> 01:05:41.422
(Maya and Annie arguing)

1164
01:05:41.423 --> 01:05:42.221
- Let's keep walking.

1165
01:05:42.222 --> 01:05:43.820
I'm not tired.

1166
01:05:43.821 --> 01:05:45.009
- You're always tired.

1167
01:05:45.010 --> 01:05:46.095
- Not today.

1168
01:05:46.096 --> 01:05:48.293
- [Maya] Listen Annie, please, Annie!

1169
01:05:48.294 --> 01:05:49.779
Listen to, listen to me!

1170
01:05:49.780 --> 01:05:54.095
- [Annie] I said, see, this
is what I'm talking about.


1171
01:05:59.317 --> 01:06:01.379
- [Franny] Have you ever been divorced?

1172
01:06:01.380 --> 01:06:04.947
- No, have you?

1173
01:06:04.948 --> 01:06:05.747
- No.

1174
01:06:07.422 --> 01:06:11.534
Henry's mom is getting
a divorce from his dad,


1175
01:06:11.535 --> 01:06:14.010
and moving in with his karate teacher.

1176
01:06:14.011 --> 01:06:15.687
- How do you know that?

1177
01:06:15.688 --> 01:06:17.207
- Henry had to get a new car,

1178
01:06:19.928 --> 01:06:23.802
'cause Henry's dad drove their minivan

1179
01:06:23.803 --> 01:06:26.702
into the lake from sadness.

1180
01:06:27.524 --> 01:06:31.192
Henry's mom said it
was only for attention.


1181
01:06:31.193 --> 01:06:32.930
And Henry had to quit karate.

1182
01:06:34.764 --> 01:06:37.132
If mommy and mama get divorced,

1183
01:06:37.133 --> 01:06:39.332
would I have to quit ice skating?

1184
01:06:43.568 --> 01:06:46.646
- Okay, I might regret saying this,

1185
01:06:46.647 --> 01:06:48.401
but I don't think your parents

1186
01:06:48.402 --> 01:06:49.891
are gonna get divorced, Franny.

1187
01:06:51.467 --> 01:06:52.400
- You really don't?

1188
01:06:52.401 --> 01:06:53.967
- I really, really don't.

1189
01:06:55.739 --> 01:06:57.225
- Promise they won't.

1190
01:06:58.645 --> 01:06:59.674
- I can't do that,

1191
01:07:00.783 --> 01:07:03.564
but I have faith that it's not
gonna go that way for them.


1192
01:07:04.629 --> 01:07:05.428
- Like in God?

1193
01:07:07.544 --> 01:07:09.370
- You can have faith in people too.

1194
01:07:13.404 --> 01:07:15.628
- Has Maya been going to
any regular appointments


1195
01:07:15.629 --> 01:07:16.444
that you know of?

1196
01:07:17.490 --> 01:07:22.236
- Um, she went to the doctor
a couple of weeks ago.


1197
01:07:22.237 --> 01:07:23.074
- Just once?

1198
01:07:23.973 --> 01:07:24.772
- I don't know.

1199
01:07:27.042 --> 01:07:28.336
- How does she seem to you?

1200
01:07:30.053 --> 01:07:33.754
I mean you're here all the
time and I ah, I can't be here,


1201
01:07:33.755 --> 01:07:36.009
and I just thought you
might have some insight.


1202
01:07:37.131 --> 01:07:38.591
- She's been pretty quiet,

1203
01:07:41.519 --> 01:07:43.109
but I don't know what's normal.

1204
01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:50.758
I do think that Maya
is really overwhelmed,


1205
01:07:50.759 --> 01:07:52.101
and she could use some help.

1206
01:07:54.067 --> 01:07:55.890
- Well, that's why you're here, right?

1207
01:07:59.208 --> 01:08:01.768
Thank you, ah, you can go home.

1208
01:08:01.769 --> 01:08:03.954
I've taken the rest of the day off.

1209
01:08:03.955 --> 01:08:06.285
- Oh, I'll just say bye to Franny.

1210
01:08:06.286 --> 01:08:07.104
- I can tell her.

1211
01:08:11.276 --> 01:08:13.266
- [Man On TV] Leaves
are not very nutritious.


1212
01:08:13.267 --> 01:08:16.513
The sloths way of compensating
for that is not to eat more,


1213
01:08:16.514 --> 01:08:17.312
(cellphone ringing)

1214
01:08:17.313 --> 01:08:18.234
but to do less.

1215
01:08:18.235 --> 01:08:20.325
It's claws hook over the branches,

1216
01:08:20.326 --> 01:08:22.826
so that the sloths can
hang without any effort.


1217
01:08:24.307 --> 01:08:25.105
(Bridget scoffs)

1218
01:08:25.106 --> 01:08:28.063
(light guitar music)

1219
01:08:35.914 --> 01:08:38.391
(Wally crying)

1220
01:08:42.852 --> 01:08:44.072
- Can you help him?

1221
01:08:44.073 --> 01:08:46.550
(Wally crying)

1222
01:08:47.927 --> 01:08:49.307
I can't be near him.

1223
01:08:49.308 --> 01:08:51.785
(Wally crying)

1224
01:08:59.492 --> 01:09:00.291
- I know.

1225
01:09:02.897 --> 01:09:04.284
There you go.

1226
01:09:04.285 --> 01:09:05.964
You remember how to do this, right?

1227
01:09:08.505 --> 01:09:09.304
Okay.

1228
01:09:14.072 --> 01:09:15.111
- Your pacie.

1229
01:09:17.207 --> 01:09:18.030
- If you need anything,

1230
01:09:18.031 --> 01:09:20.543
just say my name and
I'll be right here, okay?


1231
01:09:20.544 --> 01:09:21.401
- Is mommy okay?

1232
01:09:22.980 --> 01:09:24.326
- She's just sick right now.

1233
01:09:25.288 --> 01:09:27.015
You know how you get sick sometimes?

1234
01:09:28.523 --> 01:09:29.667
And then you get better.

1235
01:09:31.736 --> 01:09:33.506
I think we should call Annie.

1236
01:09:33.507 --> 01:09:35.652
- No, please.

1237
01:09:38.878 --> 01:09:40.198
- But we need to do something.

1238
01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:45.258
You should talk to
somebody who can help you.


1239
01:09:45.259 --> 01:09:46.393
- I've been praying.

1240
01:09:48.606 --> 01:09:51.223
I know you don't believe in that.

1241
01:09:51.224 --> 01:09:52.301
That's what helps me.

1242
01:09:54.331 --> 01:09:56.776
I've been praying to the Virgin Mary.

1243
01:09:56.777 --> 01:09:57.662
- What'd she say?

1244
01:10:00.133 --> 01:10:02.415
- That I'm doing everything wrong,

1245
01:10:02.416 --> 01:10:05.488
or at least that's what
I hear in my head.

1246
01:10:08.314 --> 01:10:10.193
- My mom told me
that when I was a baby,

1247
01:10:10.194 --> 01:10:11.938
she wanted to grab me by the ankles,

1248
01:10:11.939 --> 01:10:13.726
and slam my head against the wall.

1249
01:10:15.344 --> 01:10:16.718
She was very graphic.

1250
01:10:18.777 --> 01:10:20.684
And she said more women
should talk about that,


1251
01:10:20.685 --> 01:10:22.395
because it's really fuckin' lonely.

1252
01:10:24.349 --> 01:10:25.714
Sorry, she didn't say fuck.

1253
01:10:28.035 --> 01:10:29.866
- I just don't feel like myself.

1254
01:10:30.669 --> 01:10:31.832
- That's not your fault.

1255
01:10:36.490 --> 01:10:40.339
- I promised Franny I'd take
her to the fireworks tonight.


1256
01:10:41.986 --> 01:10:46.781
Annie's working and taking
both kids by myself.


1257
01:10:46.925 --> 01:10:47.932
- Let me go with you.

1258
01:10:48.747 --> 01:10:50.971
- You don't have plans with your friends?

1259
01:10:50.972 --> 01:10:52.691
- You and Franny are my friends.

1260
01:10:54.079 --> 01:10:55.422
This will be fun (chuckles).

1261
01:10:56.736 --> 01:10:58.042
We'll both take showers.

1262
01:10:58.043 --> 01:10:59.334
(Maya laughing)

1263
01:10:59.335 --> 01:11:00.747
We'll get dressed up.

1264
01:11:02.042 --> 01:11:04.513
Shit, ah, sorry.

1265
01:11:04.514 --> 01:11:06.843
- Oh, what happened?

1266
01:11:06.844 --> 01:11:08.762
- I've been bleeding through my tampons.

1267
01:11:10.114 --> 01:11:13.038
Maybe I could borrow one
of Wally's diapers tonight?


1268
01:11:13.039 --> 01:11:13.982
- Take one of mine.

1269
01:11:15.485 --> 01:11:16.980
Since the birth, 
I've been peeing

1270
01:11:16.981 --> 01:11:19.477
whenever I sneeze, cough,
or take a deep breath.


1271
01:11:20.712 --> 01:11:23.959
I peed a little just seconds ago.

1272
01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:26.518
(both laughing)

1273
01:11:31.681 --> 01:11:32.479
And now.

1274
01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:35.038
(both laughing)

1275
01:11:37.243 --> 01:11:38.761
- [Franny] Bridget.

1276
01:11:48.655 --> 01:11:51.612
(light guitar music)

1277
01:12:13.332 --> 01:12:14.951
(Wally crying)

1278
01:12:14.952 --> 01:12:16.358
- Oh, someone's hungry.

1279
01:12:17.688 --> 01:12:19.446
Um, you know what?

1280
01:12:20.393 --> 01:12:22.012
I'll just feed him right here.

1281
01:12:22.013 --> 01:12:22.812
- Yeah.

1282
01:12:24.928 --> 01:12:26.679
- Oh, I know, it's okay.

1283
01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:27.719
Yeah, I know.

1284
01:12:29.715 --> 01:12:30.913
Almost, almost.

1285
01:12:33.113 --> 01:12:34.868
Yeah, I know, I know.

1286
01:12:34.869 --> 01:12:35.999
I know, I know, sweetie, I know.

1287
01:12:37.531 --> 01:12:39.079
- [Bridget] Boo.

1288
01:12:39.080 --> 01:12:40.292
- Boo.

1289
01:12:40.293 --> 01:12:41.266
- Boo.

1290
01:12:41.267 --> 01:12:42.185
- [Franny] Boo.

1291
01:12:42.186 --> 01:12:44.346
- [Bridget] Boo, boo, boo.

1292
01:12:44.347 --> 01:12:45.499
- [Franny] Boo, boo, boo.

1293
01:12:45.500 --> 01:12:46.811
- [Bridget] Boo, boo, boo,
boo to infinity (chuckles).


1294
01:12:48.138 --> 01:12:49.017
- Boo, boo.

1295
01:12:50.475 --> 01:12:51.863
- [Bridget] Boo.

1296
01:12:51.864 --> 01:12:53.095
- [Franny] Boo.

1297
01:12:53.096 --> 01:12:54.307
- [Bridget] You're just the winner.

1298
01:12:59.223 --> 01:13:00.822
- Hi, hi, excuse me.

1299
01:13:02.019 --> 01:13:06.179
Could you maybe find a
restroom or go to your car.


1300
01:13:06.180 --> 01:13:06.978
(Wally crying)

1301
01:13:06.979 --> 01:13:10.617
- Oh, um, there, there,
there aren't any restrooms.


1302
01:13:10.618 --> 01:13:11.441
- [Joan] Well, maybe could you just put

1303
01:13:11.442 --> 01:13:13.427
a blanket over yourself?

1304
01:13:13.428 --> 01:13:15.201
- What exactly is the problem?

1305
01:13:15.202 --> 01:13:17.963
- There are families here.

1306
01:13:17.964 --> 01:13:19.737
- My family's here.

1307
01:13:19.738 --> 01:13:21.713
- Okay, but this is not your house,

1308
01:13:21.714 --> 01:13:25.271
so you can't just expose
yourself whenever you want.


1309
01:13:25.272 --> 01:13:26.383
- She's feeding her son.

1310
01:13:26.384 --> 01:13:28.397
- Okay, well, maybe she
could've thought about that


1311
01:13:28.398 --> 01:13:31.083
before she decided to go out in public.

1312
01:13:31.084 --> 01:13:32.253
Well, she's trying to get attention

1313
01:13:32.254 --> 01:13:35.005
from all the men here I'm thinking.

1314
01:13:35.006 --> 01:13:35.834
- She's gay.

1315
01:13:38.670 --> 01:13:40.572
- Um, you're the girlfriend?

1316
01:13:40.573 --> 01:13:41.371
- Oh.

1317
01:13:41.372 --> 01:13:42.792
- No, I'm the wife.

1318
01:13:42.793 --> 01:13:44.342
- Oh, okay.

1319
01:13:44.343 --> 01:13:46.149
- This is disgusting, both of you.

1320
01:13:46.150 --> 01:13:49.870
You know what, I really feel
for your children, I do.


1321
01:13:49.871 --> 01:13:54.090
- Hey, apologize to my family.

1322
01:13:54.091 --> 01:13:55.644
- I'm sorry, for what?

1323
01:13:55.645 --> 01:13:56.443
- For being a dick.

1324
01:13:56.444 --> 01:13:59.624
- Oh, okay, hold on, hold on.

1325
01:13:59.625 --> 01:14:00.755
My kids are here.

1326
01:14:00.756 --> 01:14:01.554
- So is mine.

1327
01:14:01.555 --> 01:14:03.642
- And I think we have the
responsibility to show them


1328
01:14:03.643 --> 01:14:06.360
that people can disagree
and still be respectful.


1329
01:14:08.534 --> 01:14:10.585
Look, I apologize if I've offended you.

1330
01:14:10.586 --> 01:14:11.384
- You have.

1331
01:14:11.385 --> 01:14:12.954
- But I'm not
sorry for feeding my son,

1332
01:14:12.955 --> 01:14:14.394
or loving my family in public.

1333
01:14:15.295 --> 01:14:17.481
- Okay, well, you can just maybe not,

1334
01:14:17.482 --> 01:14:19.255
you just don't need to
rub our face in it

1335
01:14:19.256 --> 01:14:20.676
when you're doing that.

1336
01:14:22.447 --> 01:14:27.100
- It, it's okay, 
Franny, it's okay.

1337
01:14:27.101 --> 01:14:29.914
- What did your moms teach you
to do when you meet somebody?


1338
01:14:31.114 --> 01:14:32.233
- I'm Frances.

1339
01:14:39.707 --> 01:14:41.538
What's your name?

1340
01:14:41.539 --> 01:14:42.938
- Joan.

1341
01:14:42.939 --> 01:14:43.738
- Like Joan Jett.

1342
01:14:46.023 --> 01:14:47.489
- Ah, yes, mm hmm.

1343
01:14:47.490 --> 01:14:48.289
- [Franny] Cool.

1344
01:14:51.537 --> 01:14:54.015
- I'm Maya, this is Bridget.

1345
01:14:58.654 --> 01:15:00.440
- Come on, Mom, the
fireworks are about to start.


1346
01:15:00.441 --> 01:15:03.948
- Okay, I'm gonna go get something, okay?

1347
01:15:03.949 --> 01:15:05.389
(clears throat) All right.

1348
01:15:05.390 --> 01:15:07.447
- [Franny] Bye, Joan.

1349
01:15:07.448 --> 01:15:08.716
- [Maya] Enjoy the fireworks.

1350
01:15:08.717 --> 01:15:10.751
- Yeah, you too.

1351
01:15:10.752 --> 01:15:13.033
(Maya sighs joyfully)

1352
01:15:13.034 --> 01:15:15.504
- That was the most badass
thing I've ever seen.


1353
01:15:15.505 --> 01:15:17.055
- Oh, my God, I think I
might bust out (laughing).


1354
01:15:17.056 --> 01:15:18.984
- [Bridget] Oh, my heart was going crazy.

1355
01:15:18.985 --> 01:15:20.376
- Look, my hands are shaking.

1356
01:15:21.540 --> 01:15:24.173
♪ Ah, ah, ah ♪

1357
01:15:24.174 --> 01:15:24.971
Give me that wine.

1358
01:15:24.972 --> 01:15:25.771
- [Bridget] Here.

1359
01:15:28.758 --> 01:15:30.775
Franny, you were amazing.

1360
01:15:34.111 --> 01:15:35.285
- You were amazing.

1361
01:15:35.286 --> 01:15:36.902
- Wasn't your mama awesome?

1362
01:15:36.903 --> 01:15:38.788
(fireworks thudding)

1363
01:15:38.789 --> 01:15:43.585
♪ Ah, ah, ah ♪

1364
01:15:47.212 --> 01:15:49.530
♪ Ah, ah, ah ♪

1365
01:15:54.028 --> 01:15:56.332
Are you ready, whoosh.

1366
01:15:56.333 --> 01:15:58.228
- [Franny] Can Bridget sleep over?

1367
01:15:58.229 --> 01:16:00.578
- [Maya] Um, if she wants to.

1368
01:16:00.579 --> 01:16:01.377
- Yay!

1369
01:16:01.378 --> 01:16:03.161
- I really want to.

1370
01:16:03.162 --> 01:16:05.402
- And we could all
sleep in the same bed.

1371
01:16:05.403 --> 01:16:06.955
- Is Bridget spending the night?

1372
01:16:06.956 --> 01:16:08.395
- Well, when did you get home?

1373
01:16:09.292 --> 01:16:11.160
- [Annie] Frances, go to bed.

1374
01:16:11.161 --> 01:16:12.147
- I have to brush my teeth.

1375
01:16:12.148 --> 01:16:12.969
- Skip it tonight.

1376
01:16:12.970 --> 01:16:14.709
- My teeth will rot out.

1377
01:16:14.710 --> 01:16:15.509
- Go.

1378
01:16:21.767 --> 01:16:23.023
Have you been drinking?

1379
01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:25.072
- A half a glass of wine.

1380
01:16:25.073 --> 01:16:26.644
- [Annie] And you drove?

1381
01:16:26.645 --> 01:16:27.814
- [Maya] Yes, and I was completely sober.

1382
01:16:27.815 --> 01:16:29.128
- It really was just half a glass.

1383
01:16:29.129 --> 01:16:30.490
- [Annie] Have you been drinking?

1384
01:16:30.491 --> 01:16:31.533
- I wasn't driving.

1385
01:16:31.534 --> 01:16:32.332
- You don't have to explain anything.

1386
01:16:32.333 --> 01:16:34.274
- No, Maya was awesome tonight actually.

1387
01:16:34.275 --> 01:16:35.072
- Awesome.

1388
01:16:35.073 --> 01:16:36.187
- There was this woman who tried to

1389
01:16:36.188 --> 01:16:37.875
shame her for breastfeeding Wally.

1390
01:16:37.876 --> 01:16:38.674
- [Maya] Bridget.

1391
01:16:38.675 --> 01:16:39.496
- No, you were amazing.

1392
01:16:39.497 --> 01:16:40.294
- [Annie] Amazing.

1393
01:16:40.295 --> 01:16:41.544
- You were brave and strong and kind.

1394
01:16:41.545 --> 01:16:42.948
- Annie, let's just go upstairs.

1395
01:16:42.949 --> 01:16:44.244
- Are you having an affair?

1396
01:16:48.972 --> 01:16:49.771
Are you?

1397
01:16:50.832 --> 01:16:51.631
- Of course not.

1398
01:16:52.672 --> 01:16:55.051
(Wally crying)

1399
01:16:55.052 --> 01:16:56.155
I'm gonna put him down.

1400
01:16:57.527 --> 01:16:59.213
If either of you say another word,

1401
01:16:59.214 --> 01:17:03.034
I will freak the fuck out, no talking.

1402
01:17:05.275 --> 01:17:07.752
(Wally crying)

1403
01:17:11.212 --> 01:17:12.228
- [Annie] Bridget.

1404
01:17:12.229 --> 01:17:13.359
- I don't think we're
supposed to talk right now.


1405
01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:16.179
- Grow up, she's not your mom.

1406
01:17:16.180 --> 01:17:17.406
- No, she's my friend.

1407
01:17:17.407 --> 01:17:19.363
- That's not what we hired you for.

1408
01:17:19.364 --> 01:17:21.089
- You hired me to take
care of them, right?


1409
01:17:21.090 --> 01:17:25.002
- Franny, we hired you
to take care of Franny


1410
01:17:25.003 --> 01:17:25.927
and then to leave.

1411
01:17:29.510 --> 01:17:31.988
(Wally crying)

1412
01:17:34.852 --> 01:17:35.828
I'm sorry (sniffs).

1413
01:17:39.542 --> 01:17:40.981
I don't know what's happening.

1414
01:17:47.438 --> 01:17:50.094
I feel like I'm failing my family.

1415
01:17:51.357 --> 01:17:53.298
Maya has postpartum depression,

1416
01:17:55.270 --> 01:17:56.698
and she won't talk to me about it.

1417
01:17:56.699 --> 01:17:58.693
She won't go see a doctor.

1418
01:17:58.694 --> 01:18:01.196
- I think she feels like she's failing.

1419
01:18:01.197 --> 01:18:03.880
- See and I'm so proud of her.

1420
01:18:06.597 --> 01:18:08.796
I am so proud of our family,

1421
01:18:09.886 --> 01:18:11.615
of what Maya and I have made.

1422
01:18:16.810 --> 01:18:19.710
Last week, I got an Uber.

1423
01:18:20.570 --> 01:18:24.236
The driver must've seen
me hand Wally to Maya,


1424
01:18:26.772 --> 01:18:27.694
because when I got in the car,

1425
01:18:27.695 --> 01:18:31.818
the driver asked me if I was
happy to be getting off work


1426
01:18:31.819 --> 01:18:33.698
from my babysitting job.

1427
01:18:33.699 --> 01:18:36.685
Said if I wanted to pick up
any extra hours to call her.


1428
01:18:38.001 --> 01:18:39.103
- Oh, God.

1429
01:18:39.104 --> 01:18:41.202
- You know, we knew that
kind of thing might happen,


1430
01:18:42.445 --> 01:18:44.411
and will probably continue to happen but,

1431
01:18:47.404 --> 01:18:48.860
we're prepared for that.

1432
01:18:48.861 --> 01:18:49.910
We talk through it.

1433
01:18:50.837 --> 01:18:52.422
But I wasn't prepared for this.

1434
01:18:53.398 --> 01:18:54.500
When I got home tonight,

1435
01:18:54.501 --> 01:18:57.511
I found some clothes
with fresh blood on them,


1436
01:18:57.512 --> 01:18:59.985
and I thought for just a split second

1437
01:18:59.986 --> 01:19:02.335
that Maya had tried to
maybe hurt herself or--


1438
01:19:02.336 --> 01:19:03.313
- Oh, God, no, no, no.

1439
01:19:03.314 --> 01:19:04.113
Those are mine.

1440
01:19:05.203 --> 01:19:07.025
No, I had an abortion
a couple of months ago,


1441
01:19:07.026 --> 01:19:08.511
and I've been bleeding
off and on ever since,


1442
01:19:08.512 --> 01:19:12.524
and that's too mine, but no.

1443
01:19:14.190 --> 01:19:16.356
- Have you been to the doctor?

1444
01:19:16.357 --> 01:19:19.032
- I'm fine, I'm just really
tired and weak all the time.


1445
01:19:19.033 --> 01:19:20.729
- Well, you might, you might be anemic.

1446
01:19:20.730 --> 01:19:22.121
You need to go to the doctor.

1447
01:19:23.579 --> 01:19:24.921
- You're not like horrified?

1448
01:19:25.737 --> 01:19:26.608
- That no one around here

1449
01:19:26.609 --> 01:19:28.626
knows how to go to the doctor, yes.

1450
01:19:30.896 --> 01:19:33.316
That you had an abortion, no.

1451
01:19:36.319 --> 01:19:38.956
(Bridget crying)

1452
01:19:41.417 --> 01:19:42.567
- I don't even know why I'm crying.

1453
01:19:42.568 --> 01:19:44.339
I'm an agnostic feminist (crying).

1454
01:19:46.337 --> 01:19:48.411
- I said no talking, now you're crying?

1455
01:19:51.957 --> 01:19:53.490
- I'll bring this back tomorrow.

1456
01:19:53.491 --> 01:19:54.871
- [Maya] No, keep it.

1457
01:19:54.872 --> 01:19:57.062
You look like a superhero, keep it.

1458
01:20:09.501 --> 01:20:12.458
(fireworks thudding)

1459
01:20:25.389 --> 01:20:26.734
- [Priest] Name this child.

1460
01:20:29.173 --> 01:20:31.162
- Wallace Francisco Rodriguez Paulsen.

1461
01:20:31.163 --> 01:20:33.789
(Wally crying)

1462
01:20:33.790 --> 01:20:34.949
- [Priest] Wallace Francisco,

1463
01:20:34.950 --> 01:20:36.948
I baptize you in
the name of the Father,

1464
01:20:37.783 --> 01:20:40.900
and of the Son,
and of the Holy Spirit.

1465

♪ Try to hear her sooner ♪

1466
01:20:58.246 --> 01:21:02.880
♪ We were often too far gone ♪

1467

writings on the sand ♪


1468
01:21:14.843 --> 01:21:17.799
♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ♪

1469
01:21:41.284 --> 01:21:44.641
- [Franny] Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh.

1470
01:22:00.295 --> 01:22:03.099
- God, is that you?

1471
01:22:04.707 --> 01:22:06.302
- My child.

1472
01:22:09.905 --> 01:22:12.241
Speak child.

1473
01:22:12.242 --> 01:22:15.854
- Oh, okay, well,

1474
01:22:17.491 --> 01:22:19.715
bless me Father, for I have sinned,

1475
01:22:19.716 --> 01:22:24.511
it's been 21 years since
my last confession.


1476
01:22:25.134 --> 01:22:26.164
- What are your sins?

1477
01:22:27.618 --> 01:22:29.395
- I don't have any, I'm perfect.

1478
01:22:30.235 --> 01:22:31.594
- No, play right.

1479
01:22:32.423 --> 01:22:35.520
- Okay, okay, I got one.

1480
01:22:35.521 --> 01:22:37.231
I faked my first confession.

1481
01:22:38.046 --> 01:22:39.193
- What do you mean?

1482
01:22:39.194 --> 01:22:40.792
- Well, when I got in there,
the priest wasn't there yet,


1483
01:22:40.793 --> 01:22:43.221
and so I just had a
conversation with myself,


1484
01:22:43.222 --> 01:22:45.849
and then I told everybody
how amazing it was.


1485
01:22:45.850 --> 01:22:46.847
- So you lied?

1486
01:22:47.845 --> 01:22:49.113
You lie a lot.

1487
01:22:50.367 --> 01:22:51.166
- I do?

1488
01:22:52.160 --> 01:22:54.417
- Yeah, why do you do that?

1489
01:22:55.373 --> 01:22:59.774
- I think sometimes it feels better

1490
01:22:59.775 --> 01:23:02.255
to pretend to be somebody else.

1491
01:23:02.256 --> 01:23:03.455
- [Franny] Why?

1492
01:23:05.030 --> 01:23:09.825
- Because I'm not, I'm
not an impressive person.


1493
01:23:11.964 --> 01:23:15.573
I don't have like a husband
or kids or a fancy job.


1494
01:23:16.404 --> 01:23:18.082
- Do you have to have those things?

1495
01:23:19.687 --> 01:23:20.885
- I don't know.

1496
01:23:23.687 --> 01:23:25.758
I know that I wanna
be better than I am.

1497
01:23:27.443 --> 01:23:29.067
I wanna feel proud of myself.

1498
01:23:30.637 --> 01:23:33.414
- I'm proud of you.

1499
01:23:33.415 --> 01:23:34.246
- You are?

1500
01:23:35.154 --> 01:23:35.953
- [Franny] Yeah.

1501
01:23:36.957 --> 01:23:37.944
- Why?

1502
01:23:37.945 --> 01:23:39.703
- You try even when you're scared.

1503
01:23:42.357 --> 01:23:43.928
- Like when?

1504
01:23:43.929 --> 01:23:48.724
- Like gymnastics and ice
skating and holding Wally,


1505
01:23:48.955 --> 01:23:51.691
and when that bully was mean to mommy.

1506
01:23:53.261 --> 01:23:54.220
- I was scared then.

1507
01:23:56.426 --> 01:23:57.857
- [Franny] And you were brave.

1508
01:23:59.130 --> 01:24:00.504
I am proud of you.

1509
01:24:02.256 --> 01:24:03.695
- I'm so proud of you, Franny.

1510
01:24:04.675 --> 01:24:06.677
- I'm not Franny right now.

1511
01:24:06.678 --> 01:24:08.071
- Oh, sorry.

1512
01:24:10.432 --> 01:24:13.028
- Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh,

1513
01:24:13.029 --> 01:24:16.185
whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh.

1514
01:24:16.186 --> 01:24:18.409
- What're you doing?

1515
01:24:18.410 --> 01:24:20.009
- Washing you clean.

1516
01:24:20.933 --> 01:24:24.008
Are there any other
sins you need forgiven?


1517
01:24:24.009 --> 01:24:25.819
- I mean probably a lot.

1518
01:24:25.820 --> 01:24:27.626
- Like any big ones.

1519
01:24:29.973 --> 01:24:30.772
- No.

1520
01:24:34.308 --> 01:24:36.716
- In the name of the
Father, and in the Son,


1521
01:24:36.717 --> 01:24:39.035
and in the Holy Spirit, amen.

1522
01:24:39.979 --> 01:24:40.778
- Amen.

1523
01:24:41.721 --> 01:24:42.938
- [Jace] Hey, this is Jace.

1524
01:24:42.939 --> 01:24:45.347
Leave your name and number
and I'll give you a call back.


1525
01:24:45.348 --> 01:24:46.553
(phone beeping)

1526
01:24:46.554 --> 01:24:49.789
- Hey, it's Bridget.

1527
01:24:51.283 --> 01:24:52.206
I bled on you.

1528
01:24:56.576 --> 01:24:58.191
I think I do have some feelings.

1529
01:25:01.007 --> 01:25:03.139
I think I feel mostly relieved,

1530
01:25:05.390 --> 01:25:06.764
and I feel sad,

1531
01:25:07.836 --> 01:25:10.827
and I feel pissed that you didn't

1532
01:25:10.828 --> 01:25:12.458
have to go through it, not really.

1533
01:25:13.810 --> 01:25:14.701
You were there for me,

1534
01:25:14.702 --> 01:25:16.734
but your body didn't
have to experience it,


1535
01:25:16.735 --> 01:25:19.325
and I'm pissed that I had
to deal with it for so long.


1536
01:25:20.428 --> 01:25:23.313
And I feel worried that my parents

1537
01:25:23.314 --> 01:25:24.685
will never know this thing about me,

1538
01:25:24.686 --> 01:25:26.565
and that if they did, that
they would be disappointed,


1539
01:25:26.566 --> 01:25:29.225
or that they would judge me.

1540
01:25:30.095 --> 01:25:31.475
And I'm worried that I might not ever

1541
01:25:31.476 --> 01:25:33.470
be able to get pregnant
again because I'm 34.


1542
01:25:33.471 --> 01:25:35.397
I'm a year away from
a geriatric pregnancy,


1543
01:25:35.398 --> 01:25:38.227
and, and what if this was my shot,

1544
01:25:38.228 --> 01:25:42.258
but then I think that's just
what society wants me to think.


1545
01:25:43.215 --> 01:25:47.063
And then I think do I even
want kids, and yes, I do.


1546
01:25:48.700 --> 01:25:50.362
But I don't think that was my kid.

1547
01:25:53.630 --> 01:25:55.068
I don't think that was my kid.

1548
01:25:58.454 --> 01:26:00.486
I don't even actually
think it was a kid.

1549
01:26:00.487 --> 01:26:02.068
I think it was a pocket of cells,

1550
01:26:02.069 --> 01:26:04.946
and I feel pissed that anybody
wants me to think it's a kid.


1551
01:26:07.162 --> 01:26:10.942
And mostly I'm worried about
other people who have to--


1552
01:26:10.943 --> 01:26:11.934
(phone beeps)

1553
01:26:11.935 --> 01:26:12.733
Fuck.

1554
01:26:12.734 --> 01:26:14.095
- [Woman] This voicemail box is now full.

1555
01:26:14.096 --> 01:26:15.917
To send this message, press one.

1556
01:26:15.918 --> 01:26:17.633
To rerecord, press two.

1557
01:26:17.634 --> 01:26:20.176
To delete this message, press three.

1558
01:26:20.177 --> 01:26:22.496
(phone beeps)

1559
01:26:22.497 --> 01:26:23.449
- This is Bridget.

1560
01:26:24.942 --> 01:26:26.244
I have feelings (chuckles).

1561
01:26:28.088 --> 01:26:30.054
If you still wanna
hear 'em, let me know.

1562
01:26:34.581 --> 01:26:36.019
Hello, hey, sorry.

1563
01:26:39.175 --> 01:26:40.439
Forgot to give these back.

1564
01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:41.974
- You didn't have
to come all this way.

1565
01:26:41.975 --> 01:26:44.985
- That's okay, I don't know
when I'll be up here again, so.


1566
01:26:44.986 --> 01:26:45.964
- Thank you.

1567
01:26:45.965 --> 01:26:47.838
- Okay, well, I'll see ya.

1568
01:26:48.832 --> 01:26:51.530
- Stay for dinner, please.

1569
01:26:52.451 --> 01:26:54.469
- Bless us, oh
Lord, for these our gifts

1570
01:26:54.470 --> 01:26:55.831
which we are about to receive

1571
01:26:55.832 --> 01:27:00.366
from thy bounty, through
Christ, our Lord, amen.


1572
01:27:00.367 --> 01:27:02.171
- [Annie] Amen.

1573
01:27:02.172 --> 01:27:03.726
- Who wants this?

1574
01:27:03.727 --> 01:27:05.045
- [Bridget] I'm okay, thank you.

1575
01:27:05.046 --> 01:27:06.013
- [Franny] Not me.

1576
01:27:06.014 --> 01:27:06.834
- White meat.

1577
01:27:06.835 --> 01:27:07.634
- Why not?

1578
01:27:08.436 --> 01:27:09.234
- [Bridget] Peas?

1579
01:27:09.235 --> 01:27:10.033
- [Franny] Here.

1580
01:27:10.034 --> 01:27:10.831
- [Bridget] Thank you.

1581
01:27:10.832 --> 01:27:13.423
- [Annie] That is a nice job, Franny.

1582
01:27:13.424 --> 01:27:16.111
(Maya laughing)

1583
01:27:16.112 --> 01:27:18.749
- [Maya] Oh, the act of intimacy.

1584
01:27:20.668 --> 01:27:22.322
What happened to it, remember that?

1585
01:27:22.323 --> 01:27:23.121
- Oh, yeah.

1586
01:27:23.122 --> 01:27:24.305
- [Annie] Bridget.

1587
01:27:24.306 --> 01:27:27.920
(light guitar music)

1588
01:27:27.921 --> 01:27:30.638
- [Franny] Can Bridget sleep over?

1589
01:27:40.292 --> 01:27:42.113
- If she wants to.

1590
01:27:42.114 --> 01:27:43.259
- Yay!

1591
01:27:43.260 --> 01:27:45.337
(all laughing)

1592
01:27:45.338 --> 01:27:48.135
(air pump humming)

1593
01:27:55.368 --> 01:27:58.325
(light guitar music)

1594
01:28:02.353 --> 01:28:03.174
(cellphone ringing)

1595
01:28:03.175 --> 01:28:05.733
(Franny grunts)

1596
01:28:12.909 --> 01:28:13.708
- Cute.

1597
01:28:20.687 --> 01:28:21.486
That's me.

1598
01:28:22.425 --> 01:28:23.480
- I have a lot of you.

1599
01:28:26.467 --> 01:28:27.986
- Who are they?

1600
01:28:27.987 --> 01:28:29.569
- Those are my parents.

1601
01:28:29.570 --> 01:28:30.762
- You have parents?

1602
01:28:31.603 --> 01:28:34.070
- Mm hmm and a little brother.

1603
01:28:35.487 --> 01:28:36.286
Just like you.

1604
01:28:38.503 --> 01:28:41.346
- Mommy had a
picture like this of Wally.

1605
01:28:41.347 --> 01:28:43.095
Did you have a baby?

1606
01:28:46.976 --> 01:28:47.775
- No.

1607
01:28:48.981 --> 01:28:50.042
- [Franny] Do you want one?

1608
01:28:52.081 --> 01:28:53.280
- [Bridget] I don't know.

1609
01:28:55.339 --> 01:28:56.138
Do you?

1610
01:28:57.583 --> 01:28:58.686
- I don't know.

1611
01:29:02.973 --> 01:29:07.742
- Franny, this is the
best summer I've ever had.


1612
01:29:08.737 --> 01:29:11.239
- Out of all 34?

1613
01:29:11.240 --> 01:29:12.151
- [Bridget] Mm hmm.

1614
01:29:13.844 --> 01:29:15.884
- I can't wait until next summer.

1615
01:29:29.804 --> 01:29:30.973
(knocking on door)

1616
01:29:30.974 --> 01:29:33.691
(Franny groaning)

1617
01:29:35.763 --> 01:29:37.387
- Time for school.

1618
01:29:37.388 --> 01:29:39.110
(Franny groaning)

1619
01:29:39.111 --> 01:29:42.068
(light guitar music)

1620
01:29:47.551 --> 01:29:49.549
- Ready, one, two, three.

1621
01:29:51.841 --> 01:29:53.321
- Say goodbye to kindergarten.

1622
01:29:53.322 --> 01:29:55.799
(all laughing)

1623
01:29:58.914 --> 01:29:59.712
- [Maya] Come stand up here.

1624
01:29:59.713 --> 01:30:01.391
- Hello, first grade.

1625
01:30:02.618 --> 01:30:04.536
Have the best first day.

1626
01:30:05.454 --> 01:30:08.012
(lips smacking)

1627
01:30:09.455 --> 01:30:11.512
All right, I'll see you guys.

1628
01:30:11.513 --> 01:30:13.180
- [Maya] Goodbye.

1629
01:30:13.181 --> 01:30:16.138
(light guitar music)

1630
01:30:38.500 --> 01:30:40.024
- Look, it's Joan.

1631
01:30:40.025 --> 01:30:40.824
Hi, Joan!

1632
01:30:44.110 --> 01:30:45.816
- You ready?

1633
01:30:45.817 --> 01:30:46.881
What do we say?

1634
01:30:46.882 --> 01:30:48.385
I'm smart!

1635
01:30:48.386 --> 01:30:49.756
- I'm smart!

1636
01:30:49.757 --> 01:30:51.156
- I'm brave!

1637
01:30:51.157 --> 01:30:52.594
- I'm brave!

1638
01:30:52.595 --> 01:30:54.263
- I'm the coolest!

1639
01:30:54.264 --> 01:30:56.067
- I'm the coolest!

1640
01:30:56.068 --> 01:30:57.178
- Now, growl like a tiger, ready?

1641
01:30:57.179 --> 01:30:59.656
(both roaring)

1642
01:31:01.975 --> 01:31:02.774
Go in.

1643
01:31:03.864 --> 01:31:06.820
(light guitar music)

1644
01:31:28.686 --> 01:31:30.170
- [Teacher] Put your
backpacks in the cubbies,


1645
01:31:30.171 --> 01:31:31.261
and then go wash your hands,

1646
01:31:31.262 --> 01:31:33.786
and then you can come
to the table to play.


1647
01:31:33.787 --> 01:31:34.982
Sure, I'll be right in.

1648
01:31:34.983 --> 01:31:36.032
Come on in.

1649
01:31:36.033 --> 01:31:38.528
Put your backpacks in the cubbies.

1650
01:31:38.529 --> 01:31:41.566
(children chattering)

1651
01:32:05.495 --> 01:32:06.294
- Bridget!

1652
01:32:09.891 --> 01:32:10.690
Bridget!

1653
01:32:14.409 --> 01:32:15.409
Bridget!

1654
01:32:15.410 --> 01:32:16.209
Bridget!

1655
01:32:17.146 --> 01:32:18.105
I found you!

1656
01:32:18.968 --> 01:32:21.900
Bridget, I really need you outside.

1657
01:32:21.901 --> 01:32:23.110
I love you.

1658
01:32:23.111 --> 01:32:24.510
- What're you doing?

1659
01:32:24.511 --> 01:32:26.001
- I'll tell you.

1660
01:32:26.002 --> 01:32:27.781
- You'll tell me what?

1661
01:32:27.782 --> 01:32:29.620
- When I get my period.

1662
01:32:30.563 --> 01:32:33.728
I'll call you and
we could talk about it.

1663
01:32:33.729 --> 01:32:35.975
- Franny, that's not gonna
happen for a really long time.


1664
01:32:35.976 --> 01:32:39.145
- But when it does, we
could talk about it.


1665
01:32:39.146 --> 01:32:40.968
Because we'll still be friends, right?

1666
01:32:44.764 --> 01:32:45.870
- Right.

1667
01:32:45.871 --> 01:32:48.429
(Franny crying)

1668
01:32:51.227 --> 01:32:55.411
Okay, you have to go back now, okay.

1669
01:32:55.412 --> 01:32:56.210
- I know.

1670
01:32:57.832 --> 01:32:58.631
I know!

1671
01:33:01.962 --> 01:33:04.918
