2
00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:48.540
TEACHER: Hello, hello. Good morning.
Come along now.


3
00:00:48.665 --> 00:00:52.415
Simon, no headphones.
You'll get these back after school.


4
00:00:52.498 --> 00:00:55.831
Betty, you're not Donald Duck!
Put some pants on, please!


5
00:00:56.206 --> 00:00:58.141
- DALE: Okay. What's the first thing...
- Okay, kids. Have fun at school!


6
00:00:58.165 --> 00:00:59.349
- ...that pops into your head...
- Bye, Dad!


7
00:00:59.373 --> 00:01:01.099
- ...when I say Chip 'n Dale?
- Hey, stop bumping me!


8
00:01:01.123 --> 00:01:03.331
I'm willing to bet
it's Thomas Chippendale,


9
00:01:03.415 --> 00:01:06.540
the London-based
cabinet maker from the 1700s.


10
00:01:06.623 --> 00:01:08.456
Sick cabinet, Thomas!

11
00:01:08.581 --> 00:01:12.123
But I bet the second thing
that pops into your head are these guys.


12
00:01:12.415 --> 00:01:15.998
But certainly, third would be
those rascally cartoon chipmunks,


13
00:01:16.081 --> 00:01:19.290
Chip 'n Dale,
or should I say Chip and me?


14
00:01:19.373 --> 00:01:21.165
And it all started the day we met,

15
00:01:21.248 --> 00:01:24.665
when I had to join a new school
in the middle of third grade.


16
00:01:24.748 --> 00:01:28.040
Hello, potential new friends!

17
00:01:29.248 --> 00:01:33.415
We have a new student today.
Everyone, say hello to Dale.


18
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.081
Hello, everyone. 
Nice to meet you!

19
00:01:37.623 --> 00:01:38.665
(STUDENT COUGHS)

20
00:01:40.998 --> 00:01:42.373
Uh...

21
00:01:42.456 --> 00:01:43.956
(GASPS) I know.

22
00:01:45.165 --> 00:01:49.123
- (SCREAMS) My eye! It's in my eye!
- (KIDS SCREAMING)


23
00:01:49.206 --> 00:01:50.206
(RETCHES)

24
00:01:50.415 --> 00:01:53.248
- No, no, no, no. (SCREAMS)
- DALE: Get it out!


25
00:01:54.081 --> 00:01:55.540
Uh... (CHUCKLES)

26
00:01:55.623 --> 00:01:58.623
- It's a joke. See? I'm fine.
- (KIDS SCREAMING)


27
00:01:59.081 --> 00:02:02.123
- (CRYING)
- Ew. You're weird.


28
00:02:02.373 --> 00:02:03.581
(SIGHS)

29
00:02:04.248 --> 00:02:05.248
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

30
00:02:05.331 --> 00:02:06.581
(GROANS)

31
00:02:07.165 --> 00:02:10.498
DALE: By lunchtime,
no one wanted anything to do with me.


32
00:02:12.706 --> 00:02:14.290
So, I had to sit alone.

33
00:02:17.831 --> 00:02:21.456
- (SIGHS)
- Hey. Mind if I sit?


34
00:02:23.665 --> 00:02:28.165
That pencil thing you did was hilarious!
It was excellent comic timing.


35
00:02:28.456 --> 00:02:32.081
- Really? I kind of wish I hadn't done it.
- No way, man.


36
00:02:32.248 --> 00:02:34.748
The biggest risk
is not taking any risk at all.


37
00:02:34.998 --> 00:02:38.165
You just didn't set up the joke right.
I can help you if you want.


38
00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.873
- The name's Chip.
- I'm Dale.


39
00:02:41.331 --> 00:02:42.831
So, do you watch Crispy Cow?

40
00:02:42.998 --> 00:02:44.758
- Hey! That's my milk!
- Hey! That's my milk!


41
00:02:44.873 --> 00:02:46.974
- (BOTH LAUGH)
- DALE: Chip was so funny and thoughtful


42
00:02:46.998 --> 00:02:48.158
- about everything.
- So good!


43
00:02:48.206 --> 00:02:50.873
DALE: And I never thought about anything.
We were perfect together.


44
00:02:50.998 --> 00:02:53.498
Friendship is rare
Do you know what...


45
00:02:53.581 --> 00:02:55.665
- CHIP: Come on!
- DALE: And even though,


46
00:02:55.748 --> 00:02:57.057
- we were in the same grade...
- Follow me!


47
00:02:57.081 --> 00:02:59.498
...Chip was like the older brother
I never had.


48
00:02:59.623 --> 00:03:03.040
He introduced me to cheesy crust pizza
and funny, old movies.


49
00:03:03.331 --> 00:03:05.331
- (BOTH GRUNT)
- (KIDS LAUGH)


50
00:03:05.415 --> 00:03:07.557
DALE: By high school we were headlining
the talent show.


51
00:03:07.581 --> 00:03:11.873
And for our grand finale,
The Amazing Dale will juggle everything!


52
00:03:11.956 --> 00:03:13.331
Hey!

53
00:03:13.665 --> 00:03:17.165
- Ow, ow, ow, ow. Ah!
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)


54
00:03:17.248 --> 00:03:22.165
DALE: We knew we had something special.
So, after graduation, we packed our bags


55
00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.665
- and headed to California.
- You're late! Come on!


56
00:03:24.831 --> 00:03:26.831
Move, move, move! Here, catch!

57
00:03:27.873 --> 00:03:30.081
- Nice one!
- DALE: Aw.


58
00:03:32.165 --> 00:03:35.248
(SNORES)

59
00:03:37.873 --> 00:03:40.415
Hello, potential new friends!

60
00:03:40.498 --> 00:03:43.540
Goodbye, eclectic group of bus passengers.

61
00:03:43.748 --> 00:03:46.540
Oh, what if I did something like,
"I'm into nuts."


62
00:03:46.706 --> 00:03:48.831
(CHUCKLES) Good, good.
I love it. Great stuff.


63
00:03:48.998 --> 00:03:51.498
DALE: Those first few months,
we were flat broke,


64
00:03:51.581 --> 00:03:53.498
but they were some
of the best times of my life.


65
00:03:53.581 --> 00:03:54.665
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

66
00:03:54.831 --> 00:03:58.706
...when you're off, everyone knows.
So be on, with Fresh-On Deodorant...


67
00:03:58.831 --> 00:04:01.248
- (LAUGHS) Whoa! Whoa!
- We look great.


68
00:04:01.915 --> 00:04:04.748
DALE: And after landing a few small parts,

69
00:04:04.831 --> 00:04:07.998
we finally got the call
that would change everything.


70
00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:11.373
MALE VOICE: (OVER TELEPHONE) Chip, Dale,
how would you like your own show?


71
00:04:11.456 --> 00:04:13.498
(BOTH GASP)

72
00:04:13.665 --> 00:04:16.206
-Sometimes some crimes
-DALE: Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers.


73
00:04:16.331 --> 00:04:17.724
- We had finally done it!
- Go slipping


74
00:04:17.748 --> 00:04:19.391
- DALE: Our own TV show.
- Through the cracks


75
00:04:19.415 --> 00:04:20.974
DALE: It was about a group
of little detectives...


76
00:04:20.998 --> 00:04:22.849
-But these two, Gumshoes
-...who would solve big crimes.


77
00:04:22.873 --> 00:04:25.224
- There was the adventurer, Monterey Jack.
- Are picking up the slack


78
00:04:25.248 --> 00:04:27.474
- DALE: The inventor, Gadget Hackwrench...
- Ch... Ch... Ch... Chip 'n Dale!


79
00:04:27.498 --> 00:04:29.415
- ...and Zipper, a fly.
- Rescue Rangers


80
00:04:29.498 --> 00:04:31.790
DALE: His things were, he was small
and he couldn't speak,


81
00:04:31.915 --> 00:04:33.432
- a double threat.
- When there's danger


82
00:04:33.456 --> 00:04:34.998
Ch... Ch... Ch... Chip 'n Dale!

83
00:04:35.165 --> 00:04:36.873
DALE: And then there was Chip and I,

84
00:04:36.956 --> 00:04:40.456
we were a classic odd couple
with Chip as the logical straight man...


85
00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.724
- Pass me that pipe. I've got an idea.
- ...and me as the fun-loving goof.


86
00:04:42.748 --> 00:04:45.915
- Right, what are you gonna do with it?
- You're mine now. (SNICKERS)


87
00:04:47.873 --> 00:04:53.748
Ah. (SLURPS) Birds! (CHUCKLES, GASPS)
Why you little... Come here, you.


88
00:04:55.081 --> 00:04:59.623
- (GASPS) No!
- I guess the cat's in the bag.


89
00:04:59.706 --> 00:05:05.706
(ALL LAUGH)

90
00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:16.706
- And cut. That's a wrap, folks.
- (APPLAUSE)


91
00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:19.748
Nice work, everyone!
Great job!


92
00:05:20.748 --> 00:05:25.498
And so, I just wanna thank all of you
for the greatest three years of my life.


93
00:05:25.748 --> 00:05:28.040
When I think back
to where this all started,


94
00:05:28.331 --> 00:05:32.831
me finding Dale sitting all alone
in the cafeteria, so sad.


95
00:05:32.956 --> 00:05:35.456
- Well, I wasn't that sad.
- (ALL LAUGH)


96
00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:36.665
That's funny.

97
00:05:36.748 --> 00:05:39.915
But never in my wildest dreams
did I think we'd be here now.


98
00:05:40.123 --> 00:05:43.415
So, to you, Dale, my best friend,
and to all of you.


99
00:05:43.498 --> 00:05:47.415
- And to everyone who loves a short toast.
- (CHUCKLES) Okay. Okay.


100
00:05:47.498 --> 00:05:50.956
To many more seasons
of the Rescue Rangers. Cheers!


101
00:05:51.081 --> 00:05:52.581
- Cheers!
- Cheers!


102
00:05:52.665 --> 00:05:54.099
- Over here. Get together.
- (CAMERA SHUTTERS CLICKING)


103
00:05:54.123 --> 00:05:57.623
- Everybody say, "Cha-cha-cha-cheese!
- (LAUGHTER)


104
00:06:00.581 --> 00:06:03.415
- One, two, tell me what you're...
- DALE: We were living the dream.


105
00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:07.498
High on the hog, all night long,
dancing the "Roger Rabbit,"


106
00:06:07.623 --> 00:06:10.165
- with Roger Rabbit.
- CROWD: Go, Roger. Go, Roger. Go, Roger.


107
00:06:10.248 --> 00:06:11.766
- Go, Roger.
- ROGER: Boy, what a party.


108
00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:12.998
(SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY)

109
00:06:13.123 --> 00:06:14.415
Oh, zipper.

110
00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:16.998
Oh, yeah. I love this.

111
00:06:17.623 --> 00:06:19.873
- I am into nuts!
- (LAUGHTER)


112
00:06:20.456 --> 00:06:23.040
- So good. Again, again.
- DALE: Those were some crazy fun times.


113
00:06:23.206 --> 00:06:25.290
- I'm into nuts.
- (LAUGHTER)


114
00:06:25.748 --> 00:06:27.956
- So awesome.
- DALE: Super fun.


115
00:06:28.665 --> 00:06:29.831
So fun.

116
00:06:30.248 --> 00:06:31.540
(SIGHS)

117
00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:38.581
Now, that we found love
What are we gonna do with it


118
00:06:38.706 --> 00:06:41.331
Hey, where'd you run off to, buddy?
I saved you a piece of cake.


119
00:06:42.081 --> 00:06:43.540
- What's that?
- Okay.


120
00:06:43.623 --> 00:06:49.123
I wasn't gonna show you this right now,
but it just got delivered. So... Ta-da!


121
00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:52.915
(CHUCKLES) "Double-0 Dale"?
That's hilarious. What is that?


122
00:06:53.081 --> 00:06:57.081
It's wild, right? It's my new show.
I'm gonna be a super spy.


123
00:06:57.331 --> 00:06:59.040
Wh... what are you talking about?

124
00:06:59.123 --> 00:07:01.956
Yeah, I'm really going for it.
And just like you always say,


125
00:07:02.081 --> 00:07:05.498
"The biggest risk
is not taking any risk at all." (LAUGHS)


126
00:07:06.081 --> 00:07:09.415
- Wait, you really have a new show?
- DALE: Yep!


127
00:07:09.498 --> 00:07:12.040
Wh... why didn't you
talk to me about it first?


128
00:07:12.165 --> 00:07:13.365
We tell each other everything.

129
00:07:13.456 --> 00:07:16.081
You've told me what you had
for lunch the last 42 days.


130
00:07:16.206 --> 00:07:18.331
Pineapple pizza and a diet Slice.

131
00:07:18.581 --> 00:07:20.248
- Exactly.
- DALE: I don't know.


132
00:07:20.373 --> 00:07:22.873
I just wanted to make sure
the show was gonna happen first,


133
00:07:22.956 --> 00:07:25.873
- before I got your hopes up.
- My hopes up? What?


134
00:07:25.956 --> 00:07:28.831
Yeah! It's good news for everyone.
Check this out.


135
00:07:28.915 --> 00:07:31.998
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho

136
00:07:32.123 --> 00:07:33.665
- (LAUGHS)
- I just...


137
00:07:33.998 --> 00:07:36.748
If you do this,
they might cancel the show.


138
00:07:36.831 --> 00:07:39.873
No, they won't do that. I mean,
everyone knows you're the favorite.


139
00:07:39.956 --> 00:07:41.716
And I'm just the guy
who gets hit in the head


140
00:07:41.831 --> 00:07:43.248
with a pipe each week. It's fine.

141
00:07:43.373 --> 00:07:45.498
Okay, so, you're gonna risk
all of Rescue Rangers


142
00:07:45.581 --> 00:07:47.581
because I'm a little
more popular than you?


143
00:07:47.706 --> 00:07:49.331
Do you know how dumb that is?
(SCOFFS)


144
00:07:49.873 --> 00:07:52.581
Well, I am the dumb one.

145
00:07:52.915 --> 00:07:57.165
- (SIGHS) I didn't mean it like that.

00:15:56.081 --> 00:15:59.790
I know. And if I can't pay up,
they're gonna bootleg me.


291
00:15:59.956 --> 00:16:01.873
"Bootleg you"? 
What does that mean?

292
00:16:01.956 --> 00:16:05.581
Oh, Chip. It's gotten rough out there
for us old-timers.


293
00:16:05.665 --> 00:16:07.915
Did you hear what happened
to that little guy, Flounder?


294
00:16:07.998 --> 00:16:09.998
When he fell behind on krill payments?

295
00:16:11.706 --> 00:16:12.998
Oh, no!

296
00:16:13.165 --> 00:16:18.581
- (GRUNTS) Time to pay up, fish.
- Um. How about this? Isn't it neat?


297
00:16:18.748 --> 00:16:22.040
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) Come on, fellas.
This is a genuine Dinglehopper.


298
00:16:22.123 --> 00:16:23.956
It's worth a lot. Oh!

299
00:16:24.081 --> 00:16:28.873
MONTEREY: So, they kidnap the bloke,
erase his mouth so he can't scream,


300
00:16:28.998 --> 00:16:31.581
then change him around
to try to sneak by

301
00:16:31.873 --> 00:16:34.873
the copyright laws,
and then smuggle him overseas


302
00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:39.123
to a black-market studio,
where he'll spend the rest of his life


303
00:16:39.248 --> 00:16:43.956
being forced to make
terrible bootleg movies.


304
00:16:44.248 --> 00:16:48.415
Oh, no, that's awful.
We can't let that happen to you.


305
00:16:48.498 --> 00:16:50.498
- We'll figure something out.
- You mean it?


306
00:16:50.623 --> 00:16:53.165
Of course, you were always
such a good friend to me.


307
00:16:53.373 --> 00:16:56.915
You never let me down.
I've really missed you, you big galoot!


308
00:16:56.998 --> 00:17:01.040
Oh, I missed you too, Chipper.
I know Gadget and Zipper miss you also.


309
00:17:01.206 --> 00:17:03.956
- Yeah? How are they doing?
- Oh, they're great.


310
00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:08.331
- Forty-two kids and counting.
- CHIP: Wow, look at that.


311
00:17:08.415 --> 00:17:11.123
That one's got Gadget's eyes
and Zipper's wings.


312
00:17:11.290 --> 00:17:13.873
And that one's got
her ears and hands, cute.


313
00:17:14.748 --> 00:17:17.123
We had some good times, didn't we, pal?

314
00:17:17.331 --> 00:17:19.415

That's 59 steps
to get up to your apartment.


320
00:17:31.373 --> 00:17:33.099
You do a couple of those a day
and you're in...


321
00:17:33.123 --> 00:17:35.165
- Quick! Get in!
- Okay. (LAUGHS)


322
00:17:36.123 --> 00:17:37.123
Oh.

- Dale...
- Chip.


324
00:17:40.748 --> 00:17:43.331
- Hey.
- Yep, it's me.


325
00:17:43.831 --> 00:17:46.623
- Cool.
- Yeah, I called Dale for help also.


326
00:17:46.706 --> 00:17:48.998
- I hope that's okay.
- Yeah, why wouldn't it be okay?


327
00:17:49.081 --> 00:17:51.623
I mean, it is, uh, okie-dokie artichokie.

- "Artichokie"? For real?
- Yes. "Artichokie."


329
00:17:55.415 --> 00:17:57.375
So, you're not still mad
about all the stuff with,


330
00:17:57.415 --> 00:17:59.831
you know, Double-0 Dale
and Rescue Rangers getting canceled?


331
00:17:59.998 --> 00:18:03.415
Mad? No. I'd be pretty pathetic
to care about something


332
00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:04.748
from that long ago.

333
00:18:05.123 --> 00:18:09.540
Oh. Okay. I mean, you can care a little
if you want to. I mean, I care, but...


334
00:18:09.665 --> 00:18:13.123
- So, what's been up with you?
- Oh, you know this, that,


335
00:18:13.206 --> 00:18:16.206
other vague things
to fill the space of this conversation.


336
00:18:16.331 --> 00:18:22.206
- Okay, well, you look the same.
- Yeah. Thanks. And you look... different.


337
00:18:22.415 --> 00:18:25.373
Ah! Hey, it's no secret
I had the CGI surgery done


338
00:18:25.498 --> 00:18:27.623
and it's done wonders
rejuvenating my career.


339
00:18:27.706 --> 00:18:29.831
I'm actually starring in a play tonight...

340
00:18:32.415 --> 00:18:36.123
But, man, I tell you
the real hot ticket is Rescue Rangers.


341
00:18:36.206 --> 00:18:39.331
There's even some buzz about a reboot.
Someone started a Facebook fan page


342
00:18:39.498 --> 00:18:42.790
- for it and everything.
- Crikey! A Facebook fan page?


343
00:18:42.873 --> 00:18:46.040
- They don't just give those away.
- Oh, he's full of it, Monty.


344
00:18:46.123 --> 00:18:49.415
No one's talking about
a Rescue Rangers reboot except for him.


345
00:18:49.498 --> 00:18:51.540
What? The fans are hungry for it.

346
00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:54.748
Look, I came here to help Monty,
not get caught up


347
00:18:54.831 --> 00:18:56.123
in some Hollywood nonsense.

348
00:18:56.206 --> 00:18:58.790
So, great to take this skip
down memory lane,


349
00:18:58.873 --> 00:18:59.873
but I've gotta go.

350
00:18:59.998 --> 00:19:03.456
Monty, if you're really in trouble,
you know how to find me.

354
00:19:15.206 --> 00:19:18.123
think they can squeeze a dollar
out of essentially nothing.


355

in the first place.

I've been fine without it.

357
00:19:23.165 --> 00:19:25.373
It's garbage. Total garbage.

358
00:19:25.456 --> 00:19:27.915
That's why it's better
to not even have friends.


359

after the show tonight?

wants to be friends.

he was in debt to the Valley Gang?

in the early '90s. (CHUCKLES)

- Never heard of it.

- This is my fault. I shouldn't have left.

- I'm Ellie Steckler. Uh. I am a huge fan.
- Really?


427
00:22:51.415 --> 00:22:54.040
I actually became a detective
because as a little girl


428
00:22:54.123 --> 00:22:56.956
growing up in Albany,
I wanted to help people.

- Just like you guys.
- No way. We are so honored. Namaste.

a TV show, right? Not real.

what Putty was saying to you guys.


433
00:23:10.456 --> 00:23:13.456
But I don't think it's hopeless.
I'm breaking some rules telling you this,


434
00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:15.706
but from everything
that we know about bootlegging,


435
00:23:15.790 --> 00:23:17.956

438
00:23:21.706 --> 00:23:24.706
we don't know where
Sweet Pete's bootlegging facility is.


439
00:23:24.790 --> 00:23:28.373
And every time we try to get a warrant,
we get so bogged down in red tape


440
00:23:28.456 --> 00:23:29.748
that nothing happens.

441
00:23:29.831 --> 00:23:31.998
But if you guys can find
that bootlegging facility,

both of us looking for help

You know, I got my big break

and make my own bootleg movie!


669

I called it "Flying Bedroom Boy."

670
00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:48.123
And guess what? It worked!
I made lots of money.


671
00:35:48.206 --> 00:35:52.165
So, I recruited other toons,
to star in more movies


672
00:35:52.456 --> 00:35:56.248
and bang-a-rang, now I run
my own bootleg movie studio,

and who gets thrown in the trash!

00:38:47.415 --> 00:38:49.873
- I should've...
- What's up?


730
00:38:50.165 --> 00:38:51.331
Not now, Dale.

731
00:38:51.623 --> 00:38:56.956
(SOBS) Dale! You're alive! But how?

732
00:38:58.165 --> 00:39:00.290
The name's Munk. Dale Munk.

733
00:39:00.706 --> 00:39:03.790
- (CHUCKLES)
- Ugh. Double-0 Dale, of course.


734
00:39:03.998 --> 00:39:07.790
Chip, you were crying.
You really do love me!


735
00:39:07.956 --> 00:39:10.415
- What? No! I... You were crying!
- Aw!


736
00:39:10.498 --> 00:39:12.373
- Can we...
- Chippy, Chippy, I love you too!


737
00:39:12.498 --> 00:39:14.831
Don't make it about you.
I was traumatized!


738
00:39:14.956 --> 00:39:16.099
- Aw.
- Just leave it alone, okay?


739
00:39:16.123 --> 00:39:20.498
Okay, fine. Well, that whole day
was a big waste!


740
00:39:20.623 --> 00:39:22.623
We didn't learn anything
of value except for that


741
00:39:22.706 --> 00:39:24.956
Sweet Pete wears
the same step tracker that I do.


742
00:39:25.248 --> 00:39:28.831
Wait, those step trackers,
do they keep track of everywhere you go?


743
00:39:28.915 --> 00:39:31.915
Yeah, I know because I like
to map my runs in the shape of a butt.


744
00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:33.682
- (CHUCKLES)
- I can't believe I'm saying this,


745
00:39:33.706 --> 00:39:35.331
but we need to go talk to Ellie.

746
00:39:35.456 --> 00:39:36.873
And then, I'm going home!

747
00:39:36.956 --> 00:39:39.706
DALE: Okay, but please just don't tell her
about the butt thing.


748
00:39:39.790 --> 00:39:42.081
- CHIP: I can't promise that.
- (DALE GROANS)


749
00:39:42.165 --> 00:39:43.925
Do you think she'll think
it's funny, though?


750
00:39:48.915 --> 00:39:49.915
Thanks!

751
00:39:51.165 --> 00:39:54.040
So, if we could get a hold
of Sweet Pete's step tracker,


752
00:39:54.123 --> 00:39:57.290
we could cross reference where he's been,
with where we know he goes!


753
00:39:57.373 --> 00:40:00.998
Right! And whatever doesn't overlap
has got to be his secret facility!


754
00:40:01.081 --> 00:40:04.748
Exactly! We get the step tracker,
and we can trace it to find Monty.


755
00:40:04.831 --> 00:40:08.123
- Chip, you're a genius!
- So, what's the plan?


756
00:40:08.206 --> 00:40:10.266
How are you guys gonna get
Sweet Pete's step tracker?


757
00:40:10.290 --> 00:40:12.915
"You guys"? Hold on.
We got you the info you needed.


758
00:40:12.998 --> 00:40:17.165
Now, it's up to you, the professional,
to actually, you know, get the bad guy,


759
00:40:17.248 --> 00:40:19.915
- and save our friend Monty?
- It's not as simple as that.


760
00:40:19.998 --> 00:40:23.915
We need warrants, we need probable cause,
and I don't know if you guys noticed,


761
00:40:23.998 --> 00:40:26.831
but the captain doesn't really
value my opinion too much.


762
00:40:26.915 --> 00:40:31.665
- What? He's crazy!
- No, I really screwed up.


763
00:40:32.748 --> 00:40:35.040
Last year, when Peppa Pig went missing,

764
00:40:35.123 --> 00:40:38.581
I fell for a bogus tip,
and made the whole squad


765
00:40:38.665 --> 00:40:40.581
raid Nickelodeon Junior Studios.

766
00:40:41.748 --> 00:40:43.623
And the toons fought back.

767
00:40:44.415 --> 00:40:46.665
Paw Patrol attacked Sergeant Henderson.

768
00:40:47.790 --> 00:40:49.956
The doctors say he'll never have kids.

769
00:40:51.915 --> 00:40:55.873
Huh, thank you for sharing
that absolutely bonkers story.


770
00:40:55.956 --> 00:40:59.165

what we need! Don't move.

Pretty sweet, right? All the disguises
and gadgets we could ever need.


775
00:41:33.081 --> 00:41:37.331
Wait, is this like every episode
of Rescue Rangers ever?


776
00:41:37.415 --> 00:41:40.206
- Yes, it is.

Okay, so what's your favorite episode?

780

Ooh, I... I can't pick one.
That's too hard!


781
00:41:49.165 --> 00:41:52.206
(CHUCKLES) Same. 
So good. (LAUGHS)

782
00:41:55.165 --> 00:41:57.540
I'm honestly surprised
you kept all this stuff.


783
00:41:57.873 --> 00:42:00.248
I didn't think you cared
about the show back then.


784
00:42:00.331 --> 00:42:01.956
What? Of course I did.

785
00:42:02.540 --> 00:42:04.290
No. Yeah, of course.

786
00:42:05.331 --> 00:42:07.581
What's this huge map
with all the pins in it?


787
00:42:07.665 --> 00:42:09.665
Oh, that? It's actually very cool.

788
00:42:09.790 --> 00:42:12.456
Oh, no. Is this where
all the victims are buried?


789
00:42:12.581 --> 00:42:14.748
(CHUCKLES) You're messing with me again!

790
00:42:14.831 --> 00:42:18.706
It actually shows Rescue Rangers' ratings
in every US market in 1991


791
00:42:18.790 --> 00:42:21.581
which, as you may recall,
was our most successful year.


792
00:42:21.748 --> 00:42:23.998
Hey, Ellie, didn't you say
you were from Albany?


793
00:42:24.081 --> 00:42:25.206
Born and raised.

794
00:42:25.331 --> 00:42:28.790
Well, according to this map
Rescue Rangers never aired in Albany.


795
00:42:28.873 --> 00:42:32.915
Yeah! My grandma, she used to tape
all the episodes and send them to me.


796
00:42:33.373 --> 00:42:35.623
- Hmm.
- Grandmas rule! (CHUCKLES)

into a real collectible,


800
00:42:43.123 --> 00:42:44.891
because someone noticed
that one of the clouds


801
00:42:44.915 --> 00:42:47.915
behind Monterey Jack
looked exactly like... Oprah.

Wow. So cool.

803
00:42:49.998 --> 00:42:53.831

Unfortunately, I only have 11 of the 12.

to the Russian bathhouse every Wednesday.

sneak you guys in there

without being recognized
by all those goons?


809
00:43:06.331 --> 00:43:09.998
- Wait. What if we did episode 45?
- Forty-five?


810
00:43:10.831 --> 00:43:13.581
- That's a good idea.
- No idea what you're referring to.


811
00:43:13.665 --> 00:43:15.415
And do you have any original ideas?

812
00:43:15.498 --> 00:43:17.831
Or are you just
constantly recycling old scripts?


813
00:43:17.956 --> 00:43:21.165
Oh, come on! Episode 45!
You dressed up like a rat to fool me.


814
00:43:21.290 --> 00:43:23.790
You don't remember?
You said, "Rats what I'm talking about."

Oh... Nope, no clue.

we could really use your help.

I shouldn't even be here.
