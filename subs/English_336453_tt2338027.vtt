1
00:00:23.873 --> 00:00:25.973
Ghosts are everywhere...

2
00:00:28.307 --> 00:00:30.807
whether you choose to
believe in them, or not.


3
00:00:31.907 --> 00:00:34.007
Some are simply trapped here...

4
00:00:36.873 --> 00:00:37.907
Spirits...

5
00:00:39.073 --> 00:00:41.607
looking for help to
pass on to the other side.


6
00:00:43.907 --> 00:00:45.540
Others are more dangerous.

7
00:00:46.907 --> 00:00:50.307
They are here to hurt us.

8
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.007
Ghosts exist.

9
00:01:07.973 --> 00:01:09.973
But then, so do we.

10
00:02:04.707 --> 00:02:07.007
♪ A-haunting we will go

11
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.373
♪ A-haunting we will go

12
00:02:09.407 --> 00:02:12.807
Knock it off, Jerry. We're
supposed Tobe professionals.


13
00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.573
I am a professional,

14
00:02:14.607 --> 00:02:18.873
currently lowering himself to
appear in some training film...


15
00:02:18.907 --> 00:02:22.707
for those wide-eyed little ghost
finders still in training.


16
00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.040
Hello, ghost finders, wherever you are.

17
00:02:25.073 --> 00:02:28.040
Watch. Learn. Don't have nightmares.

18
00:02:28.073 --> 00:02:31.007
Can we make a start, please?

19
00:02:33.707 --> 00:02:35.540
Hello, boys.

20
00:02:36.907 --> 00:02:39.340
Guess what I do.

21
00:02:41.607 --> 00:02:46.007
Don't anyone else feel like they have to help
with all this extremely heavy equipment.


22
00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.540
What a dump.

23
00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.007
Why don't ghost sever haunt anywhere nice,

24
00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.673
like a first-class restaurant?

25
00:02:53.707 --> 00:02:56.373
- Or Spearmint Rhino?
- Down, boy.

26
00:02:57.407 --> 00:02:58.807
Concentrate.

27
00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.273
Here be ghosts.

28
00:03:02.307 --> 00:03:04.673
Or, at least, there had better be.

29
00:03:04.707 --> 00:03:09.273
I'd hate to think I brought my nice new suit
all the way to this backwater little town...


30
00:03:09.307 --> 00:03:14.473
if there aren't ghosts, ghoulies and
long-legged beasties to be found.


31
00:03:14.507 --> 00:03:17.773
Why do I always end up having
to haul this shit around?


32
00:03:17.807 --> 00:03:19.007
Because it’s your shit.

33
00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.540
And you launch a major hissy fit
if we even try and touch it.


34
00:03:22.573 --> 00:03:24.840
That's because you always break things.

35
00:03:24.873 --> 00:03:26.607
Boys and their toys.

36
00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.307
Lower the noise level, darlings.
I need to concentrate.


37
00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.407
Team telepath.

38
00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.607
We'd be better off with a trained dog.

39
00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.840
Okay, these are disturbing.

40
00:03:37.307 --> 00:03:39.807
Either the play group's been
cutting back on the Ritalin...


41
00:03:41.573 --> 00:03:46.573
or these little tykes have been getting
very bad vibes from this place.


42
00:03:48.407 --> 00:03:53.640
It's odd. I'm not picking
up any traces of the children.


43
00:03:53.673 --> 00:03:55.840
Minds as open as theirs...

44
00:03:55.873 --> 00:03:59.007
should have left psychic
imprints all over the hall,


45
00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.540
like smudgy hand prints.

46
00:04:01.573 --> 00:04:02.790
Ian, get your toys in order.

47
00:04:02.815 --> 00:04:05.597
I want a full scan of the hall
on every level you can manage.


48
00:04:19.507 --> 00:04:21.707
Stay out of my head.

49
00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:24.740
If you don't want me in there,
you shouldn't think so loudly.


50
00:04:26.607 --> 00:04:28.473
Okay, contact has been established.

51
00:04:28.507 --> 00:04:30.940
The institute is seeing and
hearing everything we are.


52
00:04:30.973 --> 00:04:34.273
I'm sending them real-time coverage
of everything we're picking up.


53
00:04:34.307 --> 00:04:37.040
Maybe I'll give them a flash, make
sure they’re paying attention.


54
00:04:37.073 --> 00:04:39.933
- The camera will be able
to pick up something


55
00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:42.307
that small?- Funny woman.
Very funny.


56
00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.483
What do you think, Mark? Should
we just plunge right in?


57
00:04:44.507 --> 00:04:47.340
Or do we have to wait for the
Pearl & Dean adverts first?


58
00:04:47.373 --> 00:04:50.507
Just get on with it. Introduce
yourself and your team.


59
00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.440
Explain what we're doing here.

60
00:04:52.473 --> 00:04:56.373
The institute will put in all
the technical shit after.


61
00:04:56.407 --> 00:04:58.440
Recording. Three, two.

62
00:04:58.473 --> 00:05:02.340
Hello there! I'm Jerry Mackay, leader
of this happy band of ghost finders.


63
00:05:02.373 --> 00:05:05.507
We, like you, work for
the Carnacki Institute.


64
00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:08.973
Our brief is to investigate hauntings,
find out what's behind them...


65
00:05:09.007 --> 00:05:11.440
and then do something about them.

66
00:05:11.473 --> 00:05:14.373
We find ghosts, and
we lay them to rest.

67
00:05:14.407 --> 00:05:16.673
Often with extreme prejudice.

68
00:05:16.707 --> 00:05:19.473
We'll be showing you how to
deal with a standard haunting.


69
00:05:19.507 --> 00:05:23.507
Pay attention. The soul
you save may be your own.


70
00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:26.673
And make plenty of notes. There
will Bea test afterwards.


71
00:05:28.407 --> 00:05:30.507
Everybody knows there are
bad places in the world...


72
00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:33.573
Houses that make you walk by on
the other side of the street,


73
00:05:33.607 --> 00:05:36.740
bedrooms that no one in their
right mind would sleep in,


74
00:05:36.773 --> 00:05:39.507
the mirror with too many faces in it,

75
00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.440
the dim figure standing
at the foot of the bed,


76
00:05:42.473 --> 00:05:45.407
the dark at the top of the stairs.

77
00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:46.773
Places...

78
00:05:46.807 --> 00:05:50.307
where the walls of the
world have worn thin...


79
00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:53.340
and the things from outside
are trying to get in.


80
00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:58.340
There have always been ghosts...

81
00:05:59.507 --> 00:06:02.673
Things that aren’t quite dead enough,

82
00:06:02.707 --> 00:06:05.440
that hang around like...

83
00:06:05.473 --> 00:06:09.340
guests reluctant to leave the party,

84
00:06:10.407 --> 00:06:13.640
tapping on your window late at night.

85
00:06:15.473 --> 00:06:17.607
But they're dead...

86
00:06:19.507 --> 00:06:21.407
and we're alive.

87
00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:23.807
That gives us the advantage.

88
00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:27.573
Over the next few hours, we'll find the
ghost, find out what’s keeping it here,


89
00:06:27.607 --> 00:06:29.873
then put it to rest,

90
00:06:29.907 --> 00:06:32.473
whether it likes it or not.

91
00:06:32.507 --> 00:06:35.973
Because that's the job in the
Carnacki Institute field teams.


92
00:06:36.007 --> 00:06:38.540
We do not take
any shit from the hereafter.

93
00:06:38.573 --> 00:06:41.473
Good work, Jerry.

94
00:06:41.507 --> 00:06:44.540
Good words. They should be.

95
00:06:44.573 --> 00:06:47.340
He took long enough writing
them on the train coming down.


96
00:06:47.373 --> 00:06:49.749
And he locked himself in the
toilet so he could rehearse it.


97
00:06:49.773 --> 00:06:52.440
Practice and preparation
prevent piss-poor performance.


98
00:06:53.873 --> 00:06:55.907
You are right though, Ian.

99
00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:58.540
What self-respecting ghost...

100
00:06:58.573 --> 00:07:01.440
would choose to haunt a charmless
shit-hole like this one?


101
00:07:01.473 --> 00:07:04.649
Is this your subtle way of admitting you
haven't read the briefing files... again?


102
00:07:04.673 --> 00:07:06.607
Uh, I was busy.

103
00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:09.440
Inspired deathless prose doesn't
just write itself, you know.


104
00:07:09.473 --> 00:07:11.540
Plus, you always read the briefing files.

105
00:07:11.573 --> 00:07:15.540
Teacher's pet. Or is it the other
way round? One does hear rumors.


106
00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:19.973
So what are we dealing with here...

107
00:07:20.007 --> 00:07:23.473
in this entirely typical village hall?

108
00:07:23.507 --> 00:07:25.373
How long have you got?

109
00:07:31.007 --> 00:07:32.773
What a name.

110
00:07:32.807 --> 00:07:34.507
Umfraville.

111
00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:00.807
Ready to go, guys.

112
00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:04.407
Institute has hired the hall for the whole
evening, so we shouldn't be interrupted.


113
00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:08.940
But, uh, the sooner we put this one
to bed and go home, the better.


114
00:08:08.973 --> 00:08:10.540
Okay?

115
00:08:10.573 --> 00:08:13.473
Recording. Three, two.

116
00:08:14.807 --> 00:08:18.540
Just recently, people have been
getting bad feelings here.


117
00:08:18.573 --> 00:08:21.740
Feelings of unease, of being watched.

118
00:08:21.773 --> 00:08:25.873
All the traditional signs
of a standard haunting...


119
00:08:25.907 --> 00:08:30.907
A sense of an unknown presence,
glimpses of strange faces,


120
00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:33.440
unexplained figures that come and go.

121
00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:37.307
No one will stay in
hereon their own anymore.


122
00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:39.380
The local play group has
moved to a new location...


123
00:08:39.407 --> 00:08:42.907
because the children have started
having hysterics for no obvious reason.


124
00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:45.507
Though those painting son the
wall may provide a clue.


125
00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:49.907
- Hold it. This is happening by day, not
just by night?- By day and by night.


126
00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:52.973
But other than that, it's
practically textbook.


127
00:08:53.007 --> 00:08:56.373
Some people said they could smell
blood when there was no blood.


128
00:08:56.407 --> 00:08:58.507
But you're not getting anything right now?

129
00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:00.807
Not a thing, sweetie,

130
00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:03.940
which is starting to
unnerve me just a little.


131
00:09:06.607 --> 00:09:10.273
Right. Let's get this show on the road.
Ian, where’s my scan of the hall?


132
00:09:10.307 --> 00:09:13.973
I want everything from temperature
fluctuations to electromagnetic variations.


133
00:09:14.007 --> 00:09:17.540
Anna, give Mea full psychic
scan, past and present.


134
00:09:17.573 --> 00:09:20.973
Anna. Try to pick up something.

135
00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:36.307
Jerry, this isn't right.

136
00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:38.807
I'm still getting nothing,
which is just wrong.


137
00:09:40.673 --> 00:09:44.673
Given how many people have used
this hall on a regular basis,


138
00:09:44.707 --> 00:09:48.640
this room should be lousy
with trace memories.


139
00:09:48.673 --> 00:09:50.840
My head should be full of voices.

140
00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:53.707
But this place...

141
00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:57.007
is just dead.

142
00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:02.640
Which can only mean that someone...

143
00:10:02.673 --> 00:10:05.973
or something very powerful is hiding here,

144
00:10:06.007 --> 00:10:08.573
behind a projected screen of...

145
00:10:08.607 --> 00:10:10.940
Nothing to see. Move along.

146
00:10:12.307 --> 00:10:14.373
You think the institute knew about this?

147
00:10:14.407 --> 00:10:17.373
You think this could be
some kind of test for us?


148
00:10:17.407 --> 00:10:20.340
I wouldn't put it past them.

149
00:10:20.373 --> 00:10:22.607
What’s he doing here?

150
00:10:24.773 --> 00:10:26.407
Mark?

151
00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:29.440
The last thing I heard,
he was still in the asylum.


152
00:10:29.473 --> 00:10:31.573
Presumably he got better.

153
00:10:31.607 --> 00:10:33.773
But what’s he doing here?

154
00:10:33.807 --> 00:10:35.607
On this mission?

155
00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:38.640
What are you two whispering about?

156
00:10:38.673 --> 00:10:41.307
And why do I get the feeling
I’m not gonna like the answer?


157
00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:43.673
I don't know, dear. 
Maybe you're psychic.

158
00:10:43.707 --> 00:10:46.573
Ian, what's your equipment telling you?
I want a full report. Now.


159
00:10:46.607 --> 00:10:48.673
Uh, let me see. Uh...

160
00:10:48.707 --> 00:10:51.807
Is that a good "uh"or a bad "uh"?
It's hard to tell.


161
00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:54.573
I'm getting nothing on most of my readouts.
No cold spots.


162
00:10:54.607 --> 00:10:56.473
No temperature fluctuation sat all.

163
00:10:56.507 --> 00:10:59.640
And the motion sensors aren’t
picking up anything but us.


164
00:10:59.673 --> 00:11:01.973
Are you sure we've
come to the right place?

165
00:11:02.007 --> 00:11:05.340
All I'm getting is
dead air, so to speak.

166
00:11:05.373 --> 00:11:08.373
Let me know at once if
anything changes. Okay?


167
00:11:11.707 --> 00:11:14.540
Uh, what do you think, Mark?

168
00:11:14.573 --> 00:11:16.240
Should we carry on?

169
00:11:18.707 --> 00:11:22.973
Well, unless and until something really
out of the ordinary happens, yeah.


170
00:11:23.007 --> 00:11:26.273
The lack of readings could be
just local phenomena, a fluke.


171
00:11:26.307 --> 00:11:29.640
Still got a training film to make.

172
00:11:29.673 --> 00:11:32.673
Anyway, you're an experienced team.

173
00:11:32.707 --> 00:11:37.307
If something really nasty should ooze
out of the woodwork, you can handle it.


174
00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:39.040
Right?

175
00:11:39.073 --> 00:11:40.973
Right.

176
00:11:41.007 --> 00:11:44.640
So, um, talk to camera? Uh-huh.

177
00:11:44.673 --> 00:11:47.573
Now we're going to take you
through some examples...


178
00:11:47.607 --> 00:11:50.640
of what you should expect to encounter
during a standard haunting.


179
00:11:50.673 --> 00:11:55.773
Every haunting is unique, but
there are some basic types.


180
00:11:55.807 --> 00:11:59.707
Let's start with one of the
most common... poltergeists.


181
00:12:02.673 --> 00:12:05.573
- Give me the damn sedative!-
We need to get her out of here!


182
00:12:05.607 --> 00:12:08.340
Give me the bloody sedative!

183
00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:14.273
All poltergeist activity has a trigger.

184
00:12:14.307 --> 00:12:18.907
This usually turns out to be someone
in the family, often a teenage girl.


185
00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:21.707
Identify who this person is,

186
00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:23.973
remove them from the location...

187
00:12:24.007 --> 00:12:26.340
and everything should go
back to being normal.


188
00:12:26.373 --> 00:12:29.807
No supernatural treatment required.

189
00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:32.340
Unlike our next example...

190
00:12:32.373 --> 00:12:33.807
Exorcism.

191
00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:37.840
Just calm down. Damn you!
Damn you all to hell!


192
00:12:47.973 --> 00:12:51.607
That's one kind of close encounter
you may wish to avoid...


193
00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:56.273
or, at the very least,
dress appropriately for.


194
00:12:56.307 --> 00:12:57.740
Never mess around with possessions.

195
00:12:57.773 --> 00:13:00.307
Always have a reliable
exorcist on speed dial.


196
00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:03.407
If you have to do it yourself,
remember your training.


197
00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:05.840
Do not stint on the holy water.

198
00:13:05.873 --> 00:13:09.340
Now we come to what is probably the
most familiar type of haunting,


199
00:13:09.373 --> 00:13:12.273
the ghost or revenant...

200
00:13:12.307 --> 00:13:13.807
That which returns.

201
00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:39.773
Modern ghosts have adapted
to modern settings.


202
00:13:39.807 --> 00:13:41.607
They can appear anywhere.

203
00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:44.873
Just find out what links them
to the waking world, remove it,


204
00:13:44.907 --> 00:13:46.773
and they will pass on.

205
00:13:46.807 --> 00:13:50.873
And now we come to the rarest, nastiest...

206
00:13:50.907 --> 00:13:52.740
and probably the most dangerous entity...

207
00:13:52.773 --> 00:13:55.907
that you could ever encounter.

208
00:13:55.940 --> 00:14:00.773
We do not know what they are
or how they came to be.


209
00:14:00.807 --> 00:14:03.373
At the institute...

210
00:14:03.407 --> 00:14:05.440
we call them the beast.

211
00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:31.440
What the...

212
00:14:39.673 --> 00:14:42.407
Beasts are creatures.

213
00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:44.473
Things from the outside...

214
00:14:44.507 --> 00:14:47.973
always looking for a way into our reality.

215
00:14:48.007 --> 00:14:50.907
They can possess people or even places.

216
00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:55.707
Now, there are weapons that
we can use against them.


217
00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:57.840
Some of them come with a price.

218
00:14:57.873 --> 00:15:00.273
The exorcism bomb.

219
00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:05.407
If things get that bad, I
will be leaving at speed.


220
00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:06.740
Try to keep up.

221
00:15:07.907 --> 00:15:10.807
Luckily for all of us,

222
00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:13.707
beasts are rare.

223
00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:15.173
Very rare.

224
00:15:15.207 --> 00:15:18.440
You could spend your entire career
chasing ghost sand never encounter one.


225
00:15:19.773 --> 00:15:23.007
Anna, so anything new from this area?

226
00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:24.940
It's famously quiet.

227
00:15:24.973 --> 00:15:28.940
No previous history, no
weird phenomena at all.


228
00:15:28.973 --> 00:15:31.940
And all paranormal reports from this
location barely go back six months,


229
00:15:31.973 --> 00:15:36.673
so whatever happened to bring about
this haunting must be recent.


230
00:15:36.707 --> 00:15:38.040
Simple.

231
00:15:38.073 --> 00:15:40.440
No complications.

232
00:15:40.473 --> 00:15:41.907
Best kind.

233
00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:44.373
Except...

234
00:15:44.407 --> 00:15:47.273
I still want to know what...

235
00:15:47.307 --> 00:15:49.940
you're doing here, Mark.

236
00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:56.373
What is an ex-field agent of your excellent
record and hard-won reputation...


237
00:15:56.407 --> 00:15:58.873
doing here as a mere cameraman?

238
00:15:58.907 --> 00:16:00.940
You're not going to
let this go, are you?

239
00:16:00.973 --> 00:16:03.973
Not until I get a straight answer, no.

240
00:16:04.007 --> 00:16:05.973
I thought you'd retired.

241
00:16:07.807 --> 00:16:10.507
They don't let you just retire, Jerry.

242
00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:14.307
Not when you know the kind
of things that we know.


243
00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:17.440
I heard about your last
case... Buchanan Abbey.


244
00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:22.507
Was it really as bad as everyone said?

245
00:16:23.973 --> 00:16:26.973
You won't get anything from in there.

246
00:16:30.707 --> 00:16:33.907
Look, I'm a cameraman
because it keeps me busy.


247
00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:36.940
And I don't think
so much when I'm busy.

248
00:16:38.707 --> 00:16:40.907
I don't know anything more than you do.

249
00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:42.873
And if I did,

250
00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:46.440
I probably wouldn’t be here.

251
00:16:53.773 --> 00:16:57.807
Anna, what do you think?
Why the lack of readings?


252
00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:59.740
Hard to say.

253
00:16:59.773 --> 00:17:02.840
Could be a fluke like he
said... local phenomena.


254
00:17:02.873 --> 00:17:04.440
A blind spot?

255
00:17:04.473 --> 00:17:05.907
Oh, shit! Oh, shit.

256
00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:07.607
What?

257
00:17:14.373 --> 00:17:15.940
Interesting.

258
00:17:38.373 --> 00:17:39.940
Nothing.

259
00:17:39.973 --> 00:17:42.840
No view. No sign of the town.

260
00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:45.640
No lights anywhere.

261
00:17:45.673 --> 00:17:50.007
Just darkness that seems to go on forever.

262
00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:55.507
Okay, this is getting scary.

263
00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:58.373
How can it suddenly be night?

264
00:17:58.407 --> 00:18:01.273
We must have lost time.

265
00:18:01.307 --> 00:18:04.040
Three, four hours, at least.

266
00:18:04.073 --> 00:18:06.640
No, my watch is still working.

267
00:18:06.673 --> 00:18:08.573
Still says half past 5:00.

268
00:18:08.607 --> 00:18:10.673
Could it be a
time slip of some kind?

269
00:18:10.707 --> 00:18:13.407
We're still here, but the
outside world has moved on?


270
00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:16.507
No. My instruments would have
picked up something like that.


271
00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:17.940
Could it be...

272
00:18:17.973 --> 00:18:20.440
some kind of projected illusion?

273
00:18:20.473 --> 00:18:21.973
No.

274
00:18:22.007 --> 00:18:23.873
I'd have sensed that.

275
00:18:25.507 --> 00:18:28.540
But it doesn't feel like night out there.

276
00:18:29.607 --> 00:18:31.873
It's something else.

277
00:18:31.907 --> 00:18:34.507
You never have anything
good to say, do you?


278
00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:38.540
Okay, you two stay put. I'm
gonna take a look at this.


279
00:18:38.573 --> 00:18:42.273
No.Don't open the door.

280
00:18:42.307 --> 00:18:45.007
Do you want to let the darkness in?

281
00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:47.307
Oh, shit. Will you stop saying that.

282
00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:49.407
Just tell me what the bloody problem...

283
00:18:51.307 --> 00:18:53.540
Where the hell’s the door gone?

284
00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:08.807
That Wallis quite definitely solid.

285
00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:11.640
- Maybe we could break
through.- I don't think so.


286
00:19:11.673 --> 00:19:15.373
What if we did break through and
there was nothing on the other side?


287
00:19:15.407 --> 00:19:17.607
Nothing at all?

288
00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:21.773
We have got to get out of here. Forget the
stupid haunting. We're trapped in here!


289
00:19:21.807 --> 00:19:24.907
Hold everything.Look.

290
00:19:31.807 --> 00:19:34.273
What the hell is going on here?

291
00:19:34.307 --> 00:19:36.673
Someone...

292
00:19:36.707 --> 00:19:38.473
is playing us.

293
00:19:56.373 --> 00:19:57.740
It's real.

294
00:19:59.407 --> 00:20:00.773
Solid.

295
00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:05.007
Must lead somewhere.

296
00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:06.807
I wouldn't put money on that.

297
00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:10.640
- Open it.
- You open it.

298
00:20:12.373 --> 00:20:14.273
Listen.

299
00:20:14.307 --> 00:20:16.807
Voices.

300
00:20:18.873 --> 00:20:20.507
I'm hearing voices.

301
00:20:22.807 --> 00:20:24.473
Far away.

302
00:20:26.707 --> 00:20:29.340
They're not the echoes of the living.

303
00:20:30.973 --> 00:20:33.773
There's definitely someone on
the other side of that door.


304
00:20:35.307 --> 00:20:36.907
Is that good...

305
00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:38.607
or bad?

306
00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:40.240
What do you think?

307
00:20:43.407 --> 00:20:44.407
Cold.

308
00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:47.873
It suddenly got really cold.

309
00:20:47.907 --> 00:20:49.440
Do you feel it too?

310
00:20:50.573 --> 00:20:52.340
Jerry.

311
00:21:03.807 --> 00:21:06.373
A cold spot. I can measure that.

312
00:21:10.607 --> 00:21:14.373
Definite drop in temperature throughout
the hall, not just by the door.


313
00:21:14.407 --> 00:21:16.440
Twenty degrees Celsius and still dropping.

314
00:21:16.473 --> 00:21:20.773
This isn't a cold spot.
This is an energy drain.


315
00:21:20.807 --> 00:21:24.540
Something is trying
really hard to get in.


316
00:21:24.573 --> 00:21:27.040
That door is dangerous.

317
00:21:27.073 --> 00:21:30.373
It's our only way out now. Might be.

318
00:21:30.407 --> 00:21:31.907
Might not.

319
00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:34.273
Just because it looks like a door,

320
00:21:34.307 --> 00:21:37.473
it doesn't mean it's going to lead
anywhere that we might want to go.


321
00:21:37.507 --> 00:21:39.707
I am really not a happy bunny.

322
00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:42.373
Of course, we still have to
open the door. Wh-Wh-Why?


323
00:21:42.407 --> 00:21:46.340
We need to understand what
it is we're up against.


324
00:21:46.373 --> 00:21:48.907
If you open that door,

325
00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:51.973
there's no telling what you might let in.

326
00:21:53.607 --> 00:21:55.307
Whatever it is,

327
00:21:56.407 --> 00:21:58.673
we can handle it.

328
00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:31.307
Whatever it is.

329
00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:12.440
Are you getting anything, Anna?

330
00:23:13.607 --> 00:23:15.373
I'm not sensing anything.

331
00:23:15.407 --> 00:23:19.807
But can you feel that? Like hot
air blowing through the doorway.


332
00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:22.440
Yes. I feel that.

333
00:23:22.473 --> 00:23:24.607
Hot as hell.

334
00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:26.340
And it smells...

335
00:23:28.873 --> 00:23:30.873
It smells rotten.

336
00:23:39.873 --> 00:23:41.707
Jerry!

337
00:24:13.473 --> 00:24:16.340
- Whoa!
- Jerry! Are you hurt?

338
00:24:19.307 --> 00:24:22.373
- It's not mine. It's not
me.- Whose is it then?


339
00:24:27.873 --> 00:24:31.273
Does anyone have a towel? I could
really use a towel right now.


340
00:24:31.307 --> 00:24:33.607
- Is that human blood?- How
the hell should I know?


341
00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:36.573
- I've never liked blood.-
Just get it off me, please!


342
00:24:36.607 --> 00:24:38.049
- Take your jacket off.
- Handkerchief.

343
00:24:38.073 --> 00:24:39.540
- What?
- Handkerchief!

344
00:24:42.573 --> 00:24:46.573
- Oh, God, the smell.- I had
noticed that. Thank you.


345
00:24:46.607 --> 00:24:49.840
Blood is always bad at a haunting.
Blood has a voice.


346
00:24:50.773 --> 00:24:52.673
It calls.

347
00:24:52.707 --> 00:24:55.507
Calls? Calls what?

348
00:24:57.673 --> 00:24:59.507
Standard haunting, my arse.

349
00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:03.273
Are you sure you don't
know anything about this?


350
00:25:03.307 --> 00:25:06.473
They promised me this was
just another training film.


351
00:25:06.507 --> 00:25:07.640
Aah!

352
00:25:09.473 --> 00:25:12.040
Someone really doesn’t
want me filming them.


353
00:25:12.073 --> 00:25:14.507
Ian, is your tech still working?

354
00:25:17.507 --> 00:25:20.540
No smoke. No fire. 
Everything's cool.

355
00:25:20.573 --> 00:25:22.407
What now, Jerry?

356
00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:24.573
Just stay out of our way, Mark.

357
00:25:24.607 --> 00:25:26.640
We're the A-team. 
We'll handle it.

358
00:25:26.673 --> 00:25:29.807
Handle what? You don't
even know what this is.


359
00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:33.340
I'll find out. And I'll
find Usa way out of here.


360
00:25:33.373 --> 00:25:36.540
Well, sometimes there is no way out.

361
00:25:37.673 --> 00:25:40.273
Even when you do leave,

362
00:25:40.307 --> 00:25:41.940
it never leaves you behind.

363
00:25:41.973 --> 00:25:44.607
What are you talking about?

364
00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:48.973
They should have left mein the asylum.

365
00:25:49.007 --> 00:25:51.940
Jerry. It's gone.

366
00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:03.440
Wait.

367
00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:06.773
Can't see my breath in the air anymore.

368
00:26:06.807 --> 00:26:09.607
- The cold spot's gone.- Let me
check that on my instruments.


369
00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:16.440
Hall temperature
is almost back to normal.


370
00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:18.907
At least it's not leaking.

371
00:26:20.573 --> 00:26:21.973
Door full of blood?

372
00:26:23.673 --> 00:26:27.907
Anna, are you sure there was nothing in the
briefing about previous phenomena like this?


373
00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:29.640
No, nothing.

374
00:26:30.573 --> 00:26:32.273
Let me help.

375
00:26:32.307 --> 00:26:34.673
What can you do?

376
00:26:34.707 --> 00:26:37.373
I ran ghost finder teams for 15 years.

377
00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:43.240
Then tell me what we're up against here.

378
00:26:44.073 --> 00:26:45.607
I think...

379
00:26:47.607 --> 00:26:48.773
we're bait.

380
00:26:48.807 --> 00:26:51.307
Bait?

381
00:26:53.873 --> 00:26:55.507
Bait for what?

382
00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:59.007
Whatever's taken hold of this place.

383
00:27:04.673 --> 00:27:09.540
Guys, I'm looking at what seems to be a
general rise in background activity.


384
00:27:09.573 --> 00:27:12.673
All the environmental readings in the
hall just went a little bit off,


385
00:27:12.707 --> 00:27:14.940
as though something's
interfering with them.


386
00:27:14.973 --> 00:27:16.840
We're trapped.

387
00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:20.440
We could always smash the windows,

388
00:27:20.473 --> 00:27:22.107
get out that way.

389
00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:25.940
Not if the darkness outside the windows is
anything like the darkness beyond that door.


390
00:27:27.673 --> 00:27:30.507
There could be an ocean of
blood outside those windows.


391
00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:33.040
Yeah. Good point.

392
00:27:33.073 --> 00:27:35.438
Probably just
stay herewith my nice,


393
00:27:35.463 --> 00:27:37.540
safe equipment and
things I understand.


394
00:27:37.573 --> 00:27:40.673
Hold it. Nobody move.

395
00:27:40.707 --> 00:27:43.307
I'm picking up definite
energy fluctuations.


396
00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:45.840
Another door.Look.

397
00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:58.573
You want us to go have a
look at it, don't you?


398
00:27:58.607 --> 00:28:01.573
Even after what happened
with the last door?


399
00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:17.440
I'm not lending you another hankie.Shh.

400
00:28:18.673 --> 00:28:20.440
Listen.

401
00:28:25.873 --> 00:28:28.049
Can you hear anything? He's coming.

402
00:28:28.073 --> 00:28:29.573
No.

403
00:28:34.807 --> 00:28:36.573
Jerry.

404
00:28:47.373 --> 00:28:51.840
No one is to say "come
in" or even think it.


405
00:28:51.873 --> 00:28:55.973
It's a bit polite for a ghost, isn't it?
Just knocking?


406
00:28:58.507 --> 00:29:00.507
Depends what it's knocking with.

407
00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:26.673
Okay, that's just taking the piss.

408
00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:29.340
Stop that right now,

409
00:29:29.373 --> 00:29:31.607
or I will rip your keys out!

410
00:29:41.807 --> 00:29:44.407
- See?-

411
00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:47.440
Just have to know how to
talk to these things.


412
00:29:51.873 --> 00:29:53.740
Interest...

413
00:29:58.573 --> 00:30:00.807
A ghost with a sense of humor...

414
00:30:02.073 --> 00:30:04.807
is rarely a good thing.

415
00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:06.407
The door's gone.

416
00:30:10.673 --> 00:30:12.240
Mark?

417
00:30:15.807 --> 00:30:19.473
Mark? What are you doing?

418
00:30:21.473 --> 00:30:22.840
There’s something out there...

419
00:30:25.673 --> 00:30:27.540
in the dark.

420
00:30:29.373 --> 00:30:31.407
And I think it knows me.

421
00:30:32.573 --> 00:30:34.707
Mark, if there’s anything you know...

422
00:30:36.773 --> 00:30:39.573
I've seen phenomena like this once before.

423
00:30:42.007 --> 00:30:44.840
Well, not quite like this, but...

424
00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:48.807
the darkness...

425
00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:51.340
Why didn’t you tell me? Where?

426
00:30:51.373 --> 00:30:52.673
Hmm?

427
00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:55.940
Buchanan Abbey.

428
00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:01.707
Well, that's just great. Jerry, if we can
get back to thinking of a way out now...


429
00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:05.707
We need to know who or
what is doing this to us.


430
00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:07.807
Meanwhile, we're still trapped in here.

431
00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:10.440
We're not trapped until I say we are.

432
00:31:10.473 --> 00:31:12.773
- I don't think that’s
up to you, Jerry.- Mark.


433
00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:18.473
Something's coming.

434
00:31:18.507 --> 00:31:20.007
I can feel it...

435
00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:23.273
getting closer and closer,
bigger and bigger.


436
00:31:23.307 --> 00:31:25.773
Anna, hold it together. What is it?
What's coming?


437
00:31:25.807 --> 00:31:27.907
I don't know.

438
00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:31.873
But it's old and it's terrible...

439
00:31:31.907 --> 00:31:33.807
and it's trying to force its way in.

440
00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:35.573
Jerry.

441
00:31:35.607 --> 00:31:39.607
Jerry! It's time we put down some
basic shields and protections.


442
00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:42.340
Yes, of course. Anna, listen. Listen to me.

443
00:31:42.373 --> 00:31:45.740
Get your psychic shields up in the air.

444
00:31:45.773 --> 00:31:48.373
Don't let anything in. Okay?

445
00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:52.007
Ian, get me all the usual defenses.

446
00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:55.273
I want force shields. I want
psychic chaffin the air.


447
00:31:55.307 --> 00:31:57.473
I want phasers set to kill.Move.

448
00:31:59.373 --> 00:32:02.273
Take heart, boys and girls and others!

449
00:32:02.307 --> 00:32:04.407
When in doubt, go old school.

450
00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:07.940
Chalk circle, backed up by
sprinkled salt and holy water.


451
00:32:07.973 --> 00:32:10.740
And write down as many
protections as you can remember.


452
00:32:10.773 --> 00:32:13.307
You never know who may
intervene on your behalf.


453
00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:17.740
Whatever's going on here, it isn't
what we were led to believe.


454
00:32:17.773 --> 00:32:20.507
But the old protections
are always good value.


455
00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:21.840
Ian, Anna, how's it going?

456
00:32:21.873 --> 00:32:24.573
All electronic shields are in place.

457
00:32:24.607 --> 00:32:26.516
Motion detectors covering
every inch of the hall.


458
00:32:26.540 --> 00:32:29.373
And I'm monitoring even the smallest
change in the local environment.


459
00:32:29.407 --> 00:32:32.507
- Good or bad is fine.
- Uh, good, then.

460
00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:34.540
All my mental shields are in place.

461
00:32:34.573 --> 00:32:37.907
But it does mean I won't be able to help
when the bad stuff starts happening.


462
00:32:37.940 --> 00:32:41.007
- That's not cooking salt, is
it?-Never leave home without it.


463
00:32:42.907 --> 00:32:45.407
All wards and protections are in place.

464
00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:47.940
All the proper powers and
domination shave been invoked.


465
00:32:49.973 --> 00:32:51.773
Ghost finders are go.

466
00:32:55.507 --> 00:32:57.373
Are we safe now?

467
00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:00.573
What do you think?

468
00:33:04.407 --> 00:33:08.673
Well, we've laid down all the
protections set out in the manual.


469
00:33:08.707 --> 00:33:12.907
We should be safe from anything a
standard haunting can produce.


470
00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:18.640
Jerry, beloved confidante and leader
of us all, tell me the truth.


471
00:33:18.673 --> 00:33:20.940
Are we safe now?

472
00:33:20.973 --> 00:33:24.807
Which would you prefer?
The truth or a comforting lie?


473
00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:26.907
I want to go home.

474
00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:35.940
Everything’s going to be okay.

475
00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:47.807
Mark, you said you saw something
similar at Buchanan Abbey.


476
00:33:49.473 --> 00:33:51.440
How did you get out?

477
00:33:51.473 --> 00:33:53.040
- 
- What was that?

478
00:33:53.073 --> 00:33:55.640
What was what? 
What did you see?

479
00:33:55.673 --> 00:33:58.807
Ian, calm the fuck down, or I will hose
you from head to foot with Ritalin.


480
00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:02.307
Anna, what did you see?

481
00:34:03.507 --> 00:34:04.907
A face.

482
00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:09.973
A terrible face staring in at me.

483
00:34:11.807 --> 00:34:13.807
Was that it?

484
00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:18.007
I can't believe I wasted a
perfectly good panic over a face.


485
00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:19.907
It wasn't just a face.

486
00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:23.407
Whatever it was, it's gone now.

487
00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:30.873
Stay inside the protections.

488
00:34:30.907 --> 00:34:32.707
Let them do their work.

489
00:34:34.007 --> 00:34:36.373
Anna.

490
00:34:36.407 --> 00:34:37.640
Anna.

491
00:34:37.673 --> 00:34:40.040
Was it a human face?

492
00:34:40.073 --> 00:34:42.540
I think so.

493
00:34:43.607 --> 00:34:46.507
There was just something about it.

494
00:34:47.373 --> 00:34:49.373
Are you sure...

495
00:34:49.407 --> 00:34:51.540
you didn't see it?

496
00:34:53.007 --> 00:34:55.673
Any of you?

497
00:35:02.907 --> 00:35:04.540
Okay.

498
00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:09.040
Let's all take this extremely easy.

499
00:35:09.073 --> 00:35:12.040
Nothing actually threatening
or dangerous has happened yet.


500
00:35:12.073 --> 00:35:14.440
It's all just...

501
00:35:14.473 --> 00:35:15.873
sound and fury.

502
00:35:15.907 --> 00:35:18.440
It signifies nothing.

503
00:35:18.473 --> 00:35:20.473
It feels bad.

504
00:35:21.973 --> 00:35:23.807
It feels so bad.

505
00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:28.540
Something terrible is coming.

506
00:35:28.573 --> 00:35:31.840
- - And
we can't stand against it.


507
00:35:33.373 --> 00:35:35.449
I really don’t like the
readings I’m getting, Jerry.


508
00:35:35.473 --> 00:35:38.740
Half the stuff I'm looking at
I’ve never even seen before.


509
00:35:38.773 --> 00:35:41.583
The connection with the institute is
still open. They're getting all of this.


510
00:35:41.607 --> 00:35:44.373
- Why aren't they doing
anything?-Because we're professionals.


511
00:35:44.407 --> 00:35:47.907
They know whatever this
is, we can deal with it.


512
00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:51.040
I can't do this again.

513
00:35:51.073 --> 00:35:52.607
What?

514
00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:57.007
Mark, I need to know everything, now, if
there's a chance it could help my team.


515
00:35:57.040 --> 00:35:59.940
What happened at the abbey?
What happened to your team?


516
00:35:59.973 --> 00:36:01.707
See, they told me...

517
00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:04.440
that they just wanted someone with, uh...

518
00:36:04.473 --> 00:36:07.307
experience...

519
00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:08.740
to make a film.

520
00:36:08.773 --> 00:36:10.973
How did they die, Mark?

521
00:36:13.507 --> 00:36:15.340
Things went bad.

522
00:36:17.007 --> 00:36:19.373
Really quickly.

523
00:36:19.407 --> 00:36:22.740
Something truly evil had
taken hold of that place.


524
00:36:22.773 --> 00:36:25.540
We didn't stand a chance. And you
think this is the same thing?


525
00:36:25.573 --> 00:36:28.973
I told you, I recognized
some of the phenomena.


526
00:36:29.007 --> 00:36:32.873
Whatever happened before, we
need your help now, Mark.


527
00:36:32.907 --> 00:36:35.807
No, no, we need to contact the institute,

528
00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:37.807
tell them we need reinforcements.

529
00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:41.040
- They have to send another team in
here.- Ian, we can still beat this.


530
00:36:41.073 --> 00:36:44.873
He just told you the last time he
came up against something like this,


531
00:36:44.907 --> 00:36:47.540
the rest of his team died.

532
00:36:53.873 --> 00:36:55.940
Look,

533
00:36:55.973 --> 00:36:57.707
we're just off our game...

534
00:36:57.740 --> 00:37:00.940
because we weren't prepared
for something this big.


535
00:37:03.307 --> 00:37:06.340
But whatever it is, we can cope.

536
00:37:06.373 --> 00:37:09.573
Remember, we don't take any
shit from the hereafter.


537
00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:14.973
No one's buying the sales
pitch anymore, Jerry.


538
00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:21.340
Shit.

539
00:37:31.340 --> 00:37:34.273
Okay, I will officially
go on record as saying...


540
00:37:34.307 --> 00:37:37.007
that wasn't there a few moments ago.

541
00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:39.307
Check your readings.

542
00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:42.707
Can you listen in on an incoming call?

543
00:37:42.740 --> 00:37:46.607
I could if there
was one, but there isn't.

544
00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:51.273
According to my instruments, there is
no incoming call.


545
00:37:51.307 --> 00:37:54.273
Don't you dare answer it, Jerry.

546
00:37:54.307 --> 00:37:57.407
I don't think even the supernatural
can kill you over the phone, Anna.


547
00:37:57.440 --> 00:38:00.307
It'd be one hell of a cold call.

548
00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:02.740
What if it's just bait...

549
00:38:02.773 --> 00:38:05.373
to draw us outside the protections?

550
00:38:06.940 --> 00:38:08.980
Well, that thing’s clearly
going to keep ringing...


551
00:38:09.007 --> 00:38:13.307
until someone answers it or it
drives us all bloody crazy.


552
00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:17.273
You never know. Might get some
useful information out of it.


553
00:38:17.307 --> 00:38:19.373
You always were the optimistic one.

554
00:38:20.907 --> 00:38:23.273
That's why I’m team leader.

555
00:38:28.607 --> 00:38:30.907
- 
- Jerry.

556
00:38:39.540 --> 00:38:41.340
Hello. Room service.

557
00:38:41.373 --> 00:38:44.773
Die, all of you!

558
00:38:44.807 --> 00:38:47.040
Mark can't save you!

559
00:38:47.073 --> 00:38:50.773
Your family is dead! 
Your friends are dead!

560
00:38:50.807 --> 00:38:53.740
Everyone you ever cared about is dead...

561
00:38:55.373 --> 00:38:56.673
Wrong number.

562
00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:03.240
How very practical.

563
00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:06.240
A ghost that cleans up after itself.

564
00:39:15.607 --> 00:39:17.840
Jerry, get back inside the circle.

565
00:39:18.907 --> 00:39:20.907
It's not safe out there.

566
00:39:23.573 --> 00:39:25.840
Jerry, he's right.

567
00:39:39.907 --> 00:39:41.407
What is it?

568
00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:44.307
Umfraville's gone.

569
00:39:45.307 --> 00:39:47.273
The writing's changed.

570
00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:53.407
The inscription is completely different.
It's a poem.


571
00:39:54.507 --> 00:39:56.507
What kind of a poem?

572
00:39:58.007 --> 00:40:02.273
"I dreamed I saw Herod walking
in glory across the Nile,


573
00:40:02.307 --> 00:40:05.940
laughing and nodding and winking
and smiling his crocodile smile."


574
00:40:07.307 --> 00:40:08.840
What the hell is that all about?

575
00:40:08.873 --> 00:40:11.840
I just read it to you,
and I'm none the wiser.


576
00:40:11.873 --> 00:40:14.340
Yeah, but it must mean something.
It has to be significant.


577
00:40:14.373 --> 00:40:16.507
No, it doesn't.It's just
another distraction...


578
00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:18.607
to keep us from thinking
about what really matters.


579
00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:21.873
Jerry, get back here... back
inside the circle.


580
00:40:27.707 --> 00:40:29.773
Anna, are you sure there’s
nothing on record...


581
00:40:29.807 --> 00:40:31.440
that could have caused this haunting?

582
00:40:31.473 --> 00:40:33.740
No accident? No triggering incident?

583
00:40:33.773 --> 00:40:35.940
No. No one's died here or
even been badly injured.


584
00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:46.407
Ian, talk to me. Why are
the lights going out?


585
00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:48.507
It has nothing to do with me.

586
00:40:48.540 --> 00:40:50.683
According to my readings, there's
nothing wrong with the lights.


587
00:40:50.707 --> 00:40:53.473
They should be working perfectly.

588
00:40:53.507 --> 00:40:55.307
This is an attack.

589
00:40:55.340 --> 00:40:57.573
I had actually worked that one out.
Thank you.


590
00:40:57.607 --> 00:40:59.507
Mark, did this happen before?

591
00:40:59.540 --> 00:41:02.307
No. Not like this.

592
00:41:04.507 --> 00:41:06.407
Don't do that. 
They're needed!

593
00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:08.340
Easy, Ian.

594
00:41:08.373 --> 00:41:09.807
I've never liked the dark.

595
00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:11.473
How did you end up in this business?

596
00:42:07.573 --> 00:42:08.873
It's stopped.

597
00:42:10.507 --> 00:42:12.373
The darkness has stopped.

598
00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:16.573
It can't cross the chalk line.

599
00:42:16.607 --> 00:42:19.373
It can't beat the protections.

600
00:42:20.573 --> 00:42:21.607
Can it?

601
00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:24.040
This isn’t just darkness.

602
00:42:24.073 --> 00:42:27.373
I knew you were going to say that.

603
00:42:30.507 --> 00:42:33.573
My camera had infrared
and ultraviolet functions.


604
00:42:33.607 --> 00:42:36.473
Ian, what about your inbuilt camera?

605
00:42:36.507 --> 00:42:40.507
Well, yeah, but it... it's
not showing anything.


606
00:42:42.607 --> 00:42:44.807
Is the connection to the
institute still there?


607
00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:49.607
The light's still on, but... I'm
not convinced anyone’s watching.


608
00:42:50.707 --> 00:42:52.640
They're not responding.

609
00:42:55.640 --> 00:42:57.273
Send help.

610
00:42:57.307 --> 00:42:59.707
We're in deep shit and sinking fast.

611
00:43:01.007 --> 00:43:02.807
Why won't they answer me?

612
00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:04.607
Who's watching us at their end?

613
00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:07.507
Why won’t they help us?

614
00:43:07.540 --> 00:43:09.307
They did.

615
00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:13.640
They sent me.

616
00:43:15.507 --> 00:43:17.673
This was never about a training film.

617
00:43:19.807 --> 00:43:22.640
- The bastards.
- Oh, shit.

618
00:43:23.973 --> 00:43:26.373
Time to go old school again.

619
00:43:28.773 --> 00:43:30.707
What's one of the first
weapons they give you...


620
00:43:30.740 --> 00:43:32.740
before you go out into the field?

621
00:43:34.840 --> 00:43:37.507
The best defense against the dark...

622
00:43:37.540 --> 00:43:38.840
Is light.

623
00:43:40.307 --> 00:43:41.607
Light.

624
00:43:42.507 --> 00:43:44.840
Fiat Lux!

625
00:43:52.940 --> 00:43:55.440
I was rather hoping for more
than that, to be honest.


626
00:43:55.473 --> 00:43:57.773
You've stopped the advance, but that's all.

627
00:43:57.807 --> 00:44:01.307
It's still out there, and it still
wants in. Really not helping, Anna.


628
00:44:01.340 --> 00:44:04.840
No, no, no, no, no! You
gotta do something, Jerry.


629
00:44:04.873 --> 00:44:07.273
If these lights go out, we'll
be trapped herein the dark.


630
00:44:07.307 --> 00:44:10.307
Ian, relax. Everything will be okay.

631
00:44:10.340 --> 00:44:12.507
- He's coming.
- Listen.


632
00:45:48.340 --> 00:45:50.007
What is that?

633
00:45:51.673 --> 00:45:54.273
None of it’s really there.

634
00:45:54.307 --> 00:45:58.040
It's just something trying to scare us.

635
00:45:58.073 --> 00:45:59.707
It's just noises.

636
00:46:03.507 --> 00:46:04.673
Ian.

637
00:46:07.673 --> 00:46:08.873
Ian!

638
00:46:11.607 --> 00:46:14.507
I used to tell my parents...

639
00:46:14.540 --> 00:46:16.873
that there were monsters...

640
00:46:16.907 --> 00:46:20.807
hiding in the dark, waiting to get me.

641
00:46:26.973 --> 00:46:29.507
And I was right, wasn't I?

642
00:46:29.540 --> 00:46:31.340
They're closing in.

643
00:46:36.407 --> 00:46:38.507
They're right
up against the circle,


644
00:46:38.540 --> 00:46:39.940
pressing against the protections.

645
00:46:39.973 --> 00:46:41.740
What are? I don't know.

646
00:46:41.773 --> 00:46:43.440
What do they want? I don't know!

647
00:46:43.473 --> 00:46:45.473
We're all going to die!

648
00:46:45.507 --> 00:46:49.740
Jerry, a spiritual threat
requires a spiritual response.


649
00:46:49.773 --> 00:46:51.573
Hold my hand.

650
00:46:51.607 --> 00:46:52.973
Ian!

651
00:46:53.007 --> 00:46:57.440
You shouldn't be afraid of the dark, Ian.
It's much more afraid of us.


652
00:46:57.473 --> 00:46:59.707
Jerry, say the words.

653
00:46:59.740 --> 00:47:03.573
Say them like you mean it.
You have to have faith.


654
00:47:03.607 --> 00:47:05.273
I have faith in you, Anna.

655
00:47:05.307 --> 00:47:06.707
Say the words!

656
00:47:08.707 --> 00:47:10.640
Fiat Lux!

657
00:47:10.673 --> 00:47:14.740
Let there be light!

658
00:47:37.873 --> 00:47:40.273
I've had enough of this shit.

659
00:47:41.507 --> 00:47:43.607
Anna, forget your shields.

660
00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:45.940
Reach out and find the ghost...

661
00:47:45.973 --> 00:47:47.707
The one we were expecting.

662
00:47:49.607 --> 00:47:51.707
I want to talk to it.

663
00:47:53.340 --> 00:47:55.540
Okay, I'm getting
definite disturbances...


664
00:47:55.573 --> 00:47:57.673
in the background readings.

665
00:47:57.707 --> 00:48:00.273
Temperature’s dropping sharply again.

666
00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:04.473
Unquiet spirit, come forth.

667
00:48:06.507 --> 00:48:08.640
Don't think you can hide from me.

668
00:48:09.807 --> 00:48:11.807
I see you.

669
00:48:18.340 --> 00:48:19.707
Anna.

670
00:48:19.740 --> 00:48:21.373
I know what I'm doing, Jerry.

671
00:49:24.573 --> 00:49:27.740
Ian, can you see him? Of
course I can see him.


672
00:49:27.773 --> 00:49:30.473
Through the camera, Ian. Can you
see him through the camera?


673
00:49:30.507 --> 00:49:31.807
Uh...

674
00:49:33.940 --> 00:49:38.407
- Yeah.- Tell me you’re
getting some readings.


675
00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:40.640
Nothing biological.

676
00:49:40.673 --> 00:49:43.807
But I'm getting some
strange energy spikes...


677
00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:46.740
The same kind I get when anything
appears or disappears around here.


678
00:49:48.573 --> 00:49:51.373
Which strongly suggests...

679
00:49:51.407 --> 00:49:55.773
that this ghost is just a
part of the hall's phenomena.


680
00:49:55.807 --> 00:49:59.473
Another shield to hide
what’s really going on.


681
00:50:01.507 --> 00:50:03.807
Hello there.

682
00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:06.040
Welcome to the show.

683
00:50:06.073 --> 00:50:08.973
Smile for the nice ladies and
gentlemen watching at home.


684
00:50:09.007 --> 00:50:11.007
Try not to look into the camera lens.

685
00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:13.273
Can you tell me your name?

686
00:50:18.940 --> 00:50:20.740
Can you hear me, dead man?

687
00:50:22.607 --> 00:50:25.407
Something else is here, Jerry.

688
00:50:26.840 --> 00:50:29.673
Something far more dangerous
than any mere ghost.


689
00:50:30.873 --> 00:50:32.873
Who are you?

690
00:50:32.907 --> 00:50:36.407
What are you, really?

691
00:50:37.773 --> 00:50:40.007
I am the Judas Ghost.

692
00:50:42.007 --> 00:50:43.773
The Judas Ghost?

693
00:50:43.807 --> 00:50:46.340
Of course. A Judas goat. What?

694
00:50:46.373 --> 00:50:49.440
Goat? What?

695
00:50:49.473 --> 00:50:52.640
Trained to associate itself
with other sheep or cattle...


696
00:50:52.673 --> 00:50:54.840
to lure them into the slaughterhouse.

697
00:50:56.940 --> 00:50:58.540
Oh, God.

698
00:50:58.573 --> 00:51:00.573
What kind of beast?

699
00:51:00.607 --> 00:51:01.907
A beast.

700
00:51:03.573 --> 00:51:06.673
That's it. That's what
kind of haunting this is.


701
00:51:06.707 --> 00:51:08.607
You haven’t worked it out yet?

702
00:51:09.740 --> 00:51:11.840
You're so close.

703
00:51:11.873 --> 00:51:13.973
Let us out of here!

704
00:51:14.007 --> 00:51:15.740
You want a door?

705
00:51:17.740 --> 00:51:19.673
You want a way out?

706
00:51:20.573 --> 00:51:22.840
- Look behind you.
- Ian.

707
00:51:25.540 --> 00:51:27.840
- lan, no, don't!
- No!

708
00:51:29.373 --> 00:51:32.507
Lan, get back! Ian!

709
00:51:33.340 --> 00:51:34.940
- Ian!
- Get back!

710
00:51:34.973 --> 00:51:37.907
Lan! Look behind you!

711
00:51:39.473 --> 00:51:40.473
Ian!

712
00:51:42.940 --> 00:51:45.340
- Ian, no!-

713
00:51:46.907 --> 00:51:48.940
Ian! Ian!

714
00:51:50.007 --> 00:51:52.273
Lan, where are you?

715
00:51:52.307 --> 00:51:54.040
Lan, can you hear me?

716
00:51:54.073 --> 00:51:55.873
Jerry, I can't hear his thoughts.

717
00:51:55.907 --> 00:51:57.807
I can't feel his presence at all.

718
00:51:57.840 --> 00:51:58.940
Ian!

719
00:51:58.973 --> 00:52:01.640
- He's gone.
- Don't say that!

720
00:52:04.707 --> 00:52:06.007
He's gone, Jerry.

721
00:52:07.840 --> 00:52:09.940
There's nothing we can do for him.

722
00:52:09.973 --> 00:52:11.707
Help! Listen.

723
00:52:12.940 --> 00:52:15.340
Help me! Listen. 
I can hear something.

724
00:52:17.507 --> 00:52:19.673
Help me!

725
00:52:23.607 --> 00:52:24.907
Oh, God!

726
00:52:26.573 --> 00:52:27.873
It's so dark!

727
00:52:29.307 --> 00:52:30.940
Jerry. Help me!

728
00:52:30.973 --> 00:52:32.907
Get back inside the circle.

729
00:52:40.507 --> 00:52:42.907
Bring him back.

730
00:52:42.940 --> 00:52:45.340
No one comes back.

731
00:52:46.473 --> 00:52:48.740
Not from where he is now.

732
00:52:49.740 --> 00:52:51.340
Is he dead?

733
00:52:51.373 --> 00:52:53.773
You're all going to die.

734
00:53:05.507 --> 00:53:08.840
The institute knew what this
was all along, didn't they?


735
00:53:08.873 --> 00:53:10.907
That's why they sent you, Mark.

736
00:53:10.940 --> 00:53:15.473
I'm no good to you, Jerry.
I've already lost one team.


737
00:53:15.507 --> 00:53:17.673
But now's your chance to save another.

738
00:53:17.707 --> 00:53:21.373
They're dead. We're alive, remember?
That's our advantage.


739
00:53:21.407 --> 00:53:23.740
Together we have a chance.

740
00:53:23.773 --> 00:53:25.973
We need you. I need you.

741
00:53:32.973 --> 00:53:35.973
I know you’ve been through hell.

742
00:53:36.007 --> 00:53:38.473
I can only imagine what it
was like in the asylum.


743
00:53:38.507 --> 00:53:40.707
But you got better. You got...
No, I didn't.


744
00:53:43.373 --> 00:53:45.307
They never let me out.

745
00:53:47.340 --> 00:53:50.440
The institute came for
me and they told me...


746
00:53:51.740 --> 00:53:53.507
they had a job for me.

747
00:53:55.073 --> 00:53:56.773
Something easy.

748
00:53:58.307 --> 00:54:00.473
To break me back in.

749
00:54:03.373 --> 00:54:05.473
I wasn't ready for this.

750
00:54:08.373 --> 00:54:10.607
I'm sorry.

751
00:54:10.640 --> 00:54:12.773
What the fuck is going on?

752
00:54:12.807 --> 00:54:14.640
I need answers.

753
00:54:24.573 --> 00:54:26.407
Well, we’re on our own now.

754
00:54:28.307 --> 00:54:29.807
We're trapped again.

755
00:54:41.340 --> 00:54:43.940
Bad places...

756
00:54:43.973 --> 00:54:45.873
make bad ghosts.

757
00:54:45.907 --> 00:54:47.540
Really bad places...

758
00:54:47.573 --> 00:54:49.873
Make really bad ghosts.

759
00:54:49.907 --> 00:54:52.473
Something really bad
must have happened here.


760
00:54:52.507 --> 00:54:55.307
Something's been hidden from all of us.

761
00:54:57.007 --> 00:55:02.273
Anna, I need you
to find it for me.

762
00:55:02.307 --> 00:55:05.307
Find out what the beast
doesn’t want us to know.


763
00:55:41.340 --> 00:55:43.040
Here. It's hereunder the floor.

764
00:55:43.073 --> 00:55:45.840
We have to tear them up. It's
right hereunder the floor.


765
00:55:45.873 --> 00:55:48.340
We need something to pry these open with.

766
00:55:48.373 --> 00:55:50.907
Maybe I can use some
pieces from Ian's tech...


767
00:55:50.940 --> 00:55:52.573
That won’t be necessary.

768
00:56:08.440 --> 00:56:11.273
What do you think, Anna?

769
00:56:11.307 --> 00:56:13.740
Can you see what’s beneath it?

770
00:56:13.773 --> 00:56:15.540
I think...

771
00:56:18.340 --> 00:56:20.340
there's a body under there.

772
00:56:23.940 --> 00:56:25.440
The ghost's body?

773
00:56:27.073 --> 00:56:28.473
Was he murdered here?

774
00:56:29.907 --> 00:56:31.907
I don't know. I can't tell.

775
00:56:34.073 --> 00:56:36.440
What do you think it is?

776
00:56:36.473 --> 00:56:38.240
The answer.

777
00:56:55.707 --> 00:56:59.240
The stench.

778
00:57:01.540 --> 00:57:03.807
Someone made this hall
their killing ground.


779
00:57:05.340 --> 00:57:06.907
Murdered all these people...

780
00:57:06.940 --> 00:57:10.440
and hid their bodies where no one
would even think to look for them.


781
00:57:10.473 --> 00:57:12.840
This must have been going on for years.

782
00:57:12.873 --> 00:57:16.007
This was never a standard haunting.

783
00:57:16.040 --> 00:57:18.373
Not with this many deaths powering it.

784
00:57:18.407 --> 00:57:20.873
Then why weren't there any signs before?

785
00:57:20.907 --> 00:57:24.373
Why did the manifestations
only start a few months ago?


786
00:57:28.407 --> 00:57:30.340
It's here!

787
00:57:54.673 --> 00:57:57.307
Don't let it get to you.

788
00:57:57.340 --> 00:57:59.507
It's only showing off.
It's playing with us.


789
00:58:01.940 --> 00:58:03.707
I'm sorry, Anna.

790
00:58:05.973 --> 00:58:07.640
For everything.

791
00:58:13.740 --> 00:58:16.373
Did you hear that?

792
00:58:16.407 --> 00:58:17.740
Hear what?

793
00:58:18.907 --> 00:58:20.740
I heard something.

794
00:58:20.773 --> 00:58:22.373
Ian?

795
00:58:22.407 --> 00:58:24.373
I didn't hear anything.
What did you hear? Ian?


796
00:58:24.407 --> 00:58:25.907
Anna, no. No.

797
00:58:30.340 --> 00:58:32.540
My God.

798
00:58:33.507 --> 00:58:35.540
It's full of blood.

799
00:58:35.573 --> 00:58:40.340
Anna, I want you to move back away
from the edge of the opening.


800
00:58:40.373 --> 00:58:43.473
- We didn't hear anything.
- You must have!

801
00:58:43.507 --> 00:58:45.873
- Ian!
- Ian's gone. You said so.

802
00:58:45.907 --> 00:58:47.873
You let it take him!

803
00:58:51.807 --> 00:58:53.307
Anna!

804
00:58:57.540 --> 00:58:58.540
Anna!

805
00:59:00.340 --> 00:59:02.240
Anna!

806
00:59:07.707 --> 00:59:08.773
Anna!

807
01:00:28.473 --> 01:00:29.773
Jerry.

808
01:00:31.940 --> 01:00:34.473
You need to get back
inside the protections.


809
01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:41.440
They're no use anymore.

810
01:00:43.973 --> 01:00:45.973
I still think...

811
01:00:47.973 --> 01:00:50.907
we'd be safer back inside the circle.

812
01:00:52.607 --> 01:00:53.907
Come on.

813
01:01:30.540 --> 01:01:32.273
Of course.

814
01:01:41.873 --> 01:01:43.973
You woke it.

815
01:01:44.007 --> 01:01:45.740
What is it, Jerry?

816
01:01:45.773 --> 01:01:47.907
Blood has a voice.

817
01:01:47.940 --> 01:01:49.540
It calls.

818
01:01:49.573 --> 01:01:52.507
Just like Anna said.

819
01:01:52.540 --> 01:01:54.707
And something comes to possess the place.

820
01:01:54.740 --> 01:01:57.540
It's the hall, Mark.

821
01:01:57.573 --> 01:01:59.807
The hall itself is the beast.

822
01:02:02.473 --> 01:02:04.507
He killed all these people.

823
01:02:04.540 --> 01:02:08.840
He woke the beast.

824
01:02:08.873 --> 01:02:12.540
We should burn this whole
fucking place down.


825
01:02:12.573 --> 01:02:15.540
Seed the ashes with salt...

826
01:02:15.573 --> 01:02:17.673
and scatter them in the ocean.

827
01:02:17.707 --> 01:02:20.773
Is it okay if we
get out of here first?

828
01:02:20.807 --> 01:02:22.640
Perfectionist.

829
01:02:22.673 --> 01:02:25.340
You're not going anywhere.

830
01:02:25.373 --> 01:02:27.373
The beast...

831
01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:30.973
is hungry.

832
01:02:31.007 --> 01:02:34.840
He's what makes the beast possible.

833
01:02:34.873 --> 01:02:36.607
Same principle as any other ghost:

834
01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:39.040
find out what connects
it to the waking world,


835
01:02:39.073 --> 01:02:41.973
remove it, exorcise it...

836
01:02:42.007 --> 01:02:45.640
And then the beast will lose
its grip on this world,


837
01:02:45.673 --> 01:02:50.840
and the hall will go back
to being just a hall again.


838
01:02:53.873 --> 01:02:56.040
You think that'll work?

839
01:02:56.073 --> 01:02:57.673
What else have we got?

840
01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:01.640
Jerry?

841
01:03:06.340 --> 01:03:07.607
Jerry.

842
01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:08.973
No.

843
01:03:10.907 --> 01:03:12.807
Not anymore.

844
01:03:26.607 --> 01:03:28.573
You're mine now.

845
01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:34.973
Forever.

846
01:03:37.873 --> 01:03:41.273
And ever and ever.

847
01:03:55.607 --> 01:03:57.307
Jerry.

848
01:03:58.740 --> 01:04:00.840
Jerry, you fight it.

849
01:04:00.873 --> 01:04:03.573
You fight it, Jerry. I need you.

850
01:04:03.607 --> 01:04:05.473
Jerry, come on.

851
01:04:06.073 --> 01:04:08.473
Jerry.

852
01:04:08.507 --> 01:04:09.740
Anna?

853
01:04:09.773 --> 01:04:11.807
I'll be waiting for you, Jerry.

854
01:04:14.340 --> 01:04:16.340
I know you want me.

855
01:04:19.407 --> 01:04:20.707
I want you too.

856
01:04:22.340 --> 01:04:24.773
Don't fight it.

857
01:04:24.807 --> 01:04:26.807
Jerry, come on, come on.

858
01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:31.740
Jerry, I need you. Jerry, come back.
Fight it.


859
01:04:31.773 --> 01:04:33.273
Let me in.

860
01:04:35.007 --> 01:04:36.573
I'm inside.

861
01:05:02.307 --> 01:05:04.307
No! Jerry.

862
01:05:04.340 --> 01:05:07.707
Fight it, Jerry. Fight it.

863
01:05:09.940 --> 01:05:12.740
Now, come on!

864
01:05:12.773 --> 01:05:16.907
Throwing off a possession is one
of the first things they teach us!


865
01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:21.273
I must have drunk about three
pints of holy water...


866
01:05:21.307 --> 01:05:24.340
before I even came in here.

867
01:05:24.373 --> 01:05:27.807
Even my piss is holy now! Jerry.

868
01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:29.640
Come on!

869
01:05:29.673 --> 01:05:32.740
Bring back your trapdoor. I'll
fucking piss into it. Jerry.


870
01:05:34.940 --> 01:05:36.740
It's okay.

871
01:05:38.940 --> 01:05:40.940
No one in my head but me.

872
01:05:51.907 --> 01:05:53.940
Listen, Jerry.

873
01:05:53.973 --> 01:05:56.940
Maybe we can't do this on our own.

874
01:05:56.973 --> 01:05:58.707
We have to, Mark.

875
01:05:58.740 --> 01:06:00.673
No one here but us.

876
01:06:00.707 --> 01:06:03.840
You can't exorcise me.

877
01:06:03.873 --> 01:06:05.840
I'm more than just a ghost.

878
01:06:05.873 --> 01:06:07.373
You think you’re special?

879
01:06:08.707 --> 01:06:10.840
You were a murderer.

880
01:06:10.873 --> 01:06:12.973
But now you’re the victim.

881
01:06:13.007 --> 01:06:15.640
The beast killed you.

882
01:06:15.673 --> 01:06:17.973
The hall woke up hungry.

883
01:06:18.840 --> 01:06:21.840
And there I was...

884
01:06:21.873 --> 01:06:25.007
Its first real meal.

885
01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:26.973
Of course.

886
01:06:27.007 --> 01:06:30.673
Of course. The last link in the chain.

887
01:06:30.707 --> 01:06:33.940
That's why the manifestations
only started recently.


888
01:06:33.973 --> 01:06:35.773
But I was different.

889
01:06:37.373 --> 01:06:39.507
The hall could tell.

890
01:06:39.540 --> 01:06:41.940
Then we'll just have to
exorcise the entire hall.


891
01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:47.340
And you along with it.

892
01:06:49.307 --> 01:06:52.040
It'll take more than bell, book and
candle to deal with this, Jerry.


893
01:06:52.073 --> 01:06:55.573
Ordinarily, yes. But we have
a weak link here, remember?


894
01:06:55.607 --> 01:06:58.740
A weak point that we can
focus the exorcism through.


895
01:06:58.773 --> 01:07:03.440
It'll take more than holy
words to get rid of me.


896
01:07:03.473 --> 01:07:05.740
The beast protects me.

897
01:07:05.773 --> 01:07:07.507
Yes, I know.

898
01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:10.473
I need more power.

899
01:07:12.040 --> 01:07:14.540
But there is always power to be found...

900
01:07:14.573 --> 01:07:18.407
In the willing sacrifice of life.

901
01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:21.740
Jerry. You... You can't do that.

902
01:07:21.773 --> 01:07:23.407
I think you’ll find I can.

903
01:07:24.507 --> 01:07:27.307
My sacrifice is the power we need.

904
01:07:27.973 --> 01:07:29.673
I die...

905
01:07:30.740 --> 01:07:32.573
he dies.

906
01:07:32.607 --> 01:07:33.940
And the beast collapses.

907
01:07:34.807 --> 01:07:36.673
Jerry, please.

908
01:07:36.707 --> 01:07:38.007
There's got to be another way.

909
01:07:38.907 --> 01:07:40.607
I lost my team.

910
01:07:43.007 --> 01:07:44.840
They trusted me.

911
01:07:46.307 --> 01:07:47.707
I let them die.

912
01:07:49.740 --> 01:07:51.740
I have to do this.

913
01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:55.807
No, no, no, no, no!

914
01:07:55.840 --> 01:07:58.273
You did everything you could for them.

915
01:08:00.773 --> 01:08:02.640
It's me who has to make amends.

916
01:08:02.673 --> 01:08:04.007
What do you mean?

917
01:08:08.507 --> 01:08:10.573
Buchanan Abbey.

918
01:08:11.673 --> 01:08:15.473
The only reason I survived...

919
01:08:15.507 --> 01:08:17.307
and they didn't...

920
01:08:20.007 --> 01:08:22.607
was because I broke and ran.

921
01:08:24.507 --> 01:08:29.540
And I've been living with
that guilt ever since.


922
01:08:31.407 --> 01:08:34.940
Now this... this is my
chance to redeem myself.


923
01:08:34.973 --> 01:08:36.773
You didn't run. I did.

924
01:08:39.373 --> 01:08:41.440
You still got a life worth living.

925
01:08:44.940 --> 01:08:46.640
It's me.

926
01:08:48.307 --> 01:08:51.807
I'm the one who has to become...

927
01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:54.673
the exorcism bomb.

928
01:08:56.540 --> 01:08:58.307
Bloody stupid name.

929
01:09:00.940 --> 01:09:01.940
Yeah.

930
01:09:01.973 --> 01:09:02.973
No!

931
01:09:12.507 --> 01:09:13.916
Not much use against the beast,

932
01:09:13.940 --> 01:09:16.773
but perfectly adequate
against a standard haunting,


933
01:09:16.807 --> 01:09:19.940
which is all you are, really.

934
01:09:30.440 --> 01:09:31.707
Mark.

935
01:09:31.740 --> 01:09:33.807
Don't take any shit from
the hereafter, Jerry.


936
01:09:35.473 --> 01:09:38.707
Now... it's time to go.

937
01:09:40.473 --> 01:09:42.573
Time for both of us...

938
01:09:43.740 --> 01:09:45.240
to move on...

939
01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:48.673
to what's waiting for us.

940
01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:51.373
No. No!

941
01:09:52.573 --> 01:09:57.340
From all the powers of darkness and evil...

942
01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:02.840
may the good Lord deliver us.
