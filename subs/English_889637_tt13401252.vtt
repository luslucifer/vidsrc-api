1
00:00:52.067 --> 00:00:53.764
20 Minutes
until the mall closes.


2
00:00:53.851 --> 00:00:56.723
Don't miss your last chance to
meet Santa!


3
00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.813
Only 6 more days before
Christmas and remember...


4
00:00:59.901 --> 00:01:01.946
Jesus is the reason
for the season!


5
00:01:33.717 --> 00:01:36.067
All this hustle and
bustle and shopping is crazy.


6
00:01:36.154 --> 00:01:38.200
It's official...

7
00:01:38.287 --> 00:01:38.940
This is the least
Christimasy Christmas ever.


8
00:01:39.027 --> 00:01:40.898
Oh Ariel-

9
00:01:40.985 --> 00:01:41.725
Oh my goodness,
there it is!


10
00:01:44.858 --> 00:01:46.904
I need this purse more
than anything in the world.


11
00:01:46.991 --> 00:01:48.340
I've never even seen you
with a purse.


12
00:01:48.427 --> 00:01:52.866
Because I've been waiting
for this one.


13
00:01:52.954 --> 00:01:54.433
Well, I hope you're crossing
something else off of


14
00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.261
that very long list
of yours.


15
00:01:56.348 --> 00:01:58.524
No, I need
everything on it.


16
00:01:58.611 --> 00:02:00.309
You don't need
everything on it.


17
00:02:00.396 --> 00:02:02.006
Plus, didn't you just
get a huge promotion?


18
00:02:02.093 --> 00:02:03.921
Jasmine!

19
00:02:04.008 --> 00:02:06.184
Ariel's promotion is not

20
00:02:06.271 --> 00:02:08.404
a direct correlation
for a Christmas gift.


21
00:02:08.491 --> 00:02:11.363
Why not? It's not like she
has anyone to spend it on.


22
00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.105
It's not like she
has a boyfriend.


23
00:02:14.192 --> 00:02:18.370
Hey, she will find
Mr. Right.


24
00:02:18.457 --> 00:02:19.197
Sure about that?

25
00:02:19.284 --> 00:02:20.546
Someday.

26
00:02:20.633 --> 00:02:23.810
Mm-hmm.

27
00:02:23.897 --> 00:02:26.335
I don't know if the right
guy exists for Ariel.


28
00:02:26.422 --> 00:02:29.468
Yes, he does.
He exists. He does.


29
00:02:29.555 --> 00:02:31.383
So...
what are we looking for?


30
00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.213
Someone smart...

31
00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.085
Good.

32
00:02:37.172 --> 00:02:40.262
- And affectionate...
- Good.


33
00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:43.091
- Someone loyal...
- Exactly.


34
00:02:43.178 --> 00:02:45.528
Someone who makes lists of
people that we're gonna visit,


35
00:02:45.615 --> 00:02:48.400
not thingsthat he wants.

36
00:02:48.487 --> 00:02:53.275
Okay well that guy
doesn't exist yet so...


37
00:02:53.362 --> 00:02:56.017
my last exam is tomorrow at the
ungodly hour of 8 am


38
00:02:56.104 --> 00:02:56.843
so I will meet you here at 11.

39
00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.585
Wait, why?

40
00:02:59.672 --> 00:03:01.935
You have 5 days to get
your Christmas shopping done!


41
00:03:02.023 --> 00:03:03.415
I don't want to spend
the holidays shopping.


42
00:03:03.502 --> 00:03:05.548
Okay truce, truce...

43
00:03:05.635 --> 00:03:08.290
Seriously each year
I just wish that we'd


44
00:03:08.377 --> 00:03:10.596
make Christmas about spending it
with the ones we love.
- Hello!


45
00:03:10.683 --> 00:03:13.338
You know,
sitting by the fire,
baking cookies.


46
00:03:13.425 --> 00:03:16.341
I wish we could just make
ornaments and sing songs.


47
00:03:16.428 --> 00:03:17.908
Well, we already have
ornaments,


48
00:03:17.995 --> 00:03:20.084
and you can't
even sing.


49
00:03:20.171 --> 00:03:21.129
Seriously,
I don't want Christmas


50
00:03:21.216 --> 00:03:22.739
to be about
shopping lists.


51
00:03:22.826 --> 00:03:25.568
Girls, listen to me.

52
00:03:25.655 --> 00:03:28.353
Christmas is what we make it.

53
00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.790
Mm-hmm.

54
00:03:30.877 --> 00:03:32.096
I am so sorry
I didn't see you.


55
00:03:32.183 --> 00:03:33.445
Are you okay?

56
00:03:33.532 --> 00:03:36.144
Oh yes, I'm fine.

57
00:03:36.231 --> 00:03:38.276
I couldn't help but
overhear your wish.


58
00:03:38.363 --> 00:03:39.756
My wish?

59
00:03:39.843 --> 00:03:41.366
Uh-huh.

60
00:03:41.453 --> 00:03:44.326
Oh right, Santa.

61
00:03:44.413 --> 00:03:45.153
Well maybe you should
speak to my sister


62
00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.590
about her Christmas list.

63
00:03:47.677 --> 00:03:50.201
Oh no, I don't do
that sort of thing anymore.


64
00:03:50.288 --> 00:03:52.508
All the stores and online
shopping has really


65
00:03:52.595 --> 00:03:55.293
put us out of business.

66
00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.166
Now I specialize in things that
you can't get from a store.


67
00:04:01.256 --> 00:04:04.085
I'll do my best to give you the
kind of Christmas you wish for.


68
00:04:04.172 --> 00:04:06.913
But Ariel, your mother's right.

69
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.265
Some of the responsibility
lies with you.


70
00:04:10.352 --> 00:04:14.312
Christmas iswhat you make it.

71
00:04:14.399 --> 00:04:17.141
Well I'm afraid I must go,
I'm late.


72
00:04:17.228 --> 00:04:19.056
Good day.

73
00:04:19.143 --> 00:04:20.579
Bye Santa!

74
00:04:20.666 --> 00:04:23.016
Bye!
Ho, ho, ho!


75
00:04:23.104 --> 00:04:25.715
Santa...
how'd you know my name?


76
00:04:25.802 --> 00:04:28.587
That's it!
I have an idea!


77
00:04:28.674 --> 00:04:30.763
I'll do it!

78
00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:32.200
You just give me
your credit card,


79
00:04:32.287 --> 00:04:33.766
and I will shop
for everyone...


80
00:04:33.853 --> 00:04:36.160
including myself...

81
00:04:36.247 --> 00:04:37.118
and I'll even wrap
everything.


82
00:04:37.205 --> 00:04:38.684
Oh.

83
00:04:38.771 --> 00:04:40.033
What?
It's a great idea!


84
00:04:40.121 --> 00:04:41.339
That is not
a great idea.


85
00:04:41.426 --> 00:04:42.819
Okay, just listen
and hear me out.


86
00:04:42.906 --> 00:04:45.691
What if your
sister's right?


87
00:04:45.778 --> 00:04:48.868
And what if we don't have
presents this Christmas?


88
00:04:48.955 --> 00:04:50.609
Mom, seriously?

89
00:04:50.696 --> 00:04:52.524
Yeah!

90
00:04:52.611 --> 00:04:54.961
And maybe...
would that be so bad?


91
00:04:55.048 --> 00:04:57.007
Easy for you
two to say.


92
00:04:57.094 --> 00:04:59.401
You both have jobs
and money.


93
00:04:59.488 --> 00:05:02.839
I am a college student
and therefore broke.


94
00:05:02.926 --> 00:05:05.581
Christmas and birthdays
are when I stock up on things.


95
00:05:05.668 --> 00:05:07.452
Okay, well what about
the people in need?


96
00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:09.628
What about the people
who have less than us?


97
00:05:09.715 --> 00:05:11.152
Ihave less.

98
00:05:11.239 --> 00:05:13.980
Ineed things.

99
00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:17.810
Oh, here...
Hold on...


100
00:05:17.897 --> 00:05:18.985
Erica?

101
00:05:19.072 --> 00:05:19.769
Who's Erica?

102
00:05:19.856 --> 00:05:21.162
I don't know.

103
00:05:21.249 --> 00:05:23.425
Tomorrow, seriously?

104
00:05:23.512 --> 00:05:26.036
Absolutely, yes I can be
there before noon.


105
00:05:26.123 --> 00:05:28.995
Thank you, thank you,
thank you!


106
00:05:29.082 --> 00:05:30.823
The mall will
be closing in 5 minutes.


107
00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:32.477
We are gonna have the
best Christmas ever!


108
00:05:32.564 --> 00:05:34.131
How's that?
What's going on?


109
00:05:34.218 --> 00:05:35.306
I can't tell you,
but it's a surprise


110
00:05:35.393 --> 00:05:36.133
and you're
gonna love it.


111
00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:37.656
I got to get back to work,

112
00:05:37.743 --> 00:05:38.179
I'll see you after
Erica tomorrow!


113
00:05:38.266 --> 00:05:39.484
Who's Erica?

114
00:05:39.571 --> 00:05:41.138
It's a secret!

115
00:05:41.225 --> 00:05:43.096
Hey, what about
my purse?


116
00:05:43.184 --> 00:05:44.924
Oh, sorry!

117
00:05:45.011 --> 00:05:45.664
Are you gonna get
me the purse?


118
00:05:45.751 --> 00:05:47.057
Not a chance.

119
00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:01.767
A surprise?
Maybe a Christmas bonus?


120
00:06:11.124 --> 00:06:12.996
Mr. Huckabee!

121
00:06:13.083 --> 00:06:15.477
Come in.

122
00:06:15.564 --> 00:06:17.000
Mr. Huckabee was my father.

123
00:06:17.087 --> 00:06:19.611
Please call me Jeremy.

124
00:06:21.831 --> 00:06:23.311
I'm giving you the
new online Christmas


125
00:06:23.398 --> 00:06:25.356
morning feature article.

126
00:06:25.443 --> 00:06:26.531
Really?

127
00:06:26.618 --> 00:06:28.141
Yes.

128
00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:28.751
Oh!

129
00:06:31.884 --> 00:06:33.146
Oh.

130
00:06:33.234 --> 00:06:36.976
Bring on the Grinch, eh?

131
00:06:37.063 --> 00:06:39.283
Amazing huh?

132
00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:39.588
It's definitely
something different.


133
00:06:39.675 --> 00:06:41.590
Exactly!

134
00:06:41.677 --> 00:06:43.679
I want to shake things up!Uh-huh.

135
00:06:43.766 --> 00:06:45.420
This is not my father's
magazine anymore.Uh-huh.


136
00:06:45.507 --> 00:06:47.726
This is a modern
publication.Uh-huh.


137
00:06:47.813 --> 00:06:49.511
Shouldn't I be writing something

138
00:06:49.598 --> 00:06:51.252
more heartwarming for the
Christmas issue?


139
00:06:51.339 --> 00:06:54.298
I would like to expand
our artistic range, Ariel.


140
00:06:54.385 --> 00:06:56.561
All of the sweet and
happy stuff gets


141
00:06:56.648 --> 00:07:00.870
rather well,
you know, boring.


142
00:07:00.957 --> 00:07:04.482
But the magazine is called
"Sweet Home."


143
00:07:04.569 --> 00:07:06.832
Besides, people love reading
happyChristmas stories!


144
00:07:06.919 --> 00:07:08.573
People love sensational
stories,


145
00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:11.402
and I love money.

146
00:07:11.489 --> 00:07:13.926
And this right here
is money.


147
00:07:14.013 --> 00:07:16.625
Ariel, all you have to do is
find someone who hates Christmas


148
00:07:16.712 --> 00:07:18.627
and write about them.

149
00:07:18.714 --> 00:07:22.500
Mr. Huckabee...
Jeremy...


150
00:07:22.587 --> 00:07:24.372
I don't know if I'm the right
person for thisjob.


151
00:07:24.459 --> 00:07:26.243
I have faith in you.

152
00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:27.897
In my hands by
Christmas Eve.


153
00:07:27.984 --> 00:07:29.594
It's going to be
a stunning article!


154
00:07:33.468 --> 00:07:35.383
Yeah, one that youshould
clearly be writing.


155
00:08:37.532 --> 00:08:41.666
Oh, it's perfect!

156
00:08:58.117 --> 00:09:00.729
Low power?

157
00:09:00.816 --> 00:09:02.905
Oh...
Charger, charger...


158
00:09:06.212 --> 00:09:07.692
Really?

159
00:09:11.479 --> 00:09:12.567
I love it so much.

160
00:09:13.742 --> 00:09:14.917
Merry Christmas, Erica!

161
00:09:16.005 --> 00:09:17.920
Here's your keys!

162
00:09:18.007 --> 00:09:19.661
Seriously, it's mine?

163
00:09:19.748 --> 00:09:21.576
Mm-hmm.

164
00:09:21.663 --> 00:09:23.447
As soon as you complete
on the sale,


165
00:09:23.534 --> 00:09:27.538
you are the proud owner of
Mountain Holly Cottage!


166
00:09:27.625 --> 00:09:29.192
I brought
a cashier's check.


167
00:09:29.279 --> 00:09:30.411
- Great!
- Thank you so much.


168
00:09:30.498 --> 00:09:32.325
This means more than you know.

169
00:09:32.413 --> 00:09:33.588
There wasa little hiccup
a few days ago,


170
00:09:33.675 --> 00:09:34.763
but it all got
sorted out.


171
00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:37.418
Oh yeah?
Yeah.


172
00:09:37.505 --> 00:09:39.985
There was another buyer who
reallywanted the place,


173
00:09:40.072 --> 00:09:42.379
but I knew your top price
and so I worked the deal


174
00:09:42.466 --> 00:09:45.556
until you won the bid.

175
00:09:45.643 --> 00:09:47.906
Apparently with
room to spare.


176
00:09:47.993 --> 00:09:49.821
Ooh, careful of the
candy canes...


177
00:09:49.908 --> 00:09:52.084
they mark the property line.

178
00:09:52.171 --> 00:09:54.870
I cannot wait
to see the inside!


179
00:10:01.746 --> 00:10:03.792
Oh my, it's breathtaking!

180
00:10:07.578 --> 00:10:08.449
I can't believe it was
on the market


181
00:10:08.536 --> 00:10:10.799
for such a great price.

182
00:10:10.886 --> 00:10:13.497
It's an amazing space.

183
00:10:13.584 --> 00:10:18.110
Don't you just love it?

184
00:10:18.197 --> 00:10:19.808
It's fully furnished which is
great so you won't have to


185
00:10:19.895 --> 00:10:21.984
replace it before Christmas.

186
00:10:22.071 --> 00:10:24.334
You can just picture
a Christmas tree here.


187
00:10:24.421 --> 00:10:25.901
I can't wait to show my family.

188
00:10:25.988 --> 00:10:27.032
They're gonna love it!

189
00:10:27.119 --> 00:10:28.991
Turkey in the oven...

190
00:10:29.078 --> 00:10:31.080
Everyone sitting by
the fireplace making


191
00:10:31.167 --> 00:10:33.256
decorations while
sipping apple cider


192
00:10:33.343 --> 00:10:35.432
after a day of
snowshoeing...


193
00:10:35.519 --> 00:10:39.480
while trimming the tree.

194
00:10:39.567 --> 00:10:41.220
I made an itinerary.

195
00:10:41.307 --> 00:10:43.135
Here we are!

196
00:10:43.222 --> 00:10:46.095
Oh!

197
00:10:52.754 --> 00:10:55.017
Uh, who are you?

198
00:10:55.104 --> 00:10:57.062
I'm Erica Holden with
Equity Homes Realty.


199
00:10:57.149 --> 00:10:59.761
This is my client.

200
00:10:59.848 --> 00:11:01.284
I'm afraid this place
sold this morning.


201
00:11:01.371 --> 00:11:02.067
Yes it did...

202
00:11:02.154 --> 00:11:06.158
to me!

203
00:11:06.245 --> 00:11:08.160
I'm sorry,
that's impossible.


204
00:11:08.247 --> 00:11:09.422
I have the papers right here.

205
00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:11.686
Perhaps I can help
you with that.


206
00:11:11.773 --> 00:11:13.426
I'm Nick Sage with...

207
00:11:15.646 --> 00:11:18.214
And you are
in my client's cottage.


208
00:11:27.615 --> 00:11:31.357
What?

209
00:11:31.444 --> 00:11:33.621
What?I'm not sure I can easily
explain what happened-


210
00:11:33.708 --> 00:11:35.927
Oh, let me try.

211
00:11:36.014 --> 00:11:37.189
It looks like you
bothbought this place.


212
00:11:37.276 --> 00:11:39.191
Well how is
that possible?


213
00:11:39.278 --> 00:11:42.630
It looks like both
offers were accepted.


214
00:11:42.717 --> 00:11:44.893
Well how much did you pay?

215
00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:47.199
You both paid
the same amount.


216
00:11:47.286 --> 00:11:49.288
Okay you know what, why don't we
just call the seller's agent


217
00:11:49.375 --> 00:11:52.465
and I'm sure we can just
clear this up.


218
00:11:52.553 --> 00:11:55.556
That's the problem.
There is no seller's agent.


219
00:11:55.643 --> 00:11:57.993
What do you mean?

220
00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:00.865
He is a sweet elderly man
who for some reason


221
00:12:00.952 --> 00:12:03.085
sold this place without
an agent.


222
00:12:03.172 --> 00:12:05.740
Well, why don't we call

223
00:12:05.827 --> 00:12:08.438
that sweet, elderly
gentlemen and ask him


224
00:12:08.525 --> 00:12:09.787
who he'd rather sell to.

225
00:12:09.874 --> 00:12:11.093
I'm the obvious choice.

226
00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:13.051
And how's that?

227
00:12:13.138 --> 00:12:15.140
No offense but
between the two of us...


228
00:12:15.227 --> 00:12:17.186
I belong here.

229
00:12:17.273 --> 00:12:19.362
Besides, I'm made
for cottage life.


230
00:12:19.449 --> 00:12:22.887
Right because this
clearly says


231
00:12:22.974 --> 00:12:23.714
"I love the outdoors."

232
00:12:26.587 --> 00:12:29.024
I'll call the
title office and


233
00:12:29.111 --> 00:12:31.940
see if we can clear
this up.


234
00:12:32.027 --> 00:12:35.683
And I'll go help
and be not here.


235
00:12:48.391 --> 00:12:51.742
A skylight here would be nice.

236
00:12:51.829 --> 00:12:54.658
Yeah, bring a little
bit more natural light.


237
00:12:54.745 --> 00:12:57.269
Yeah, especially
in the mornings.


238
00:12:57.356 --> 00:12:58.923
You really love
this house, huh?


239
00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:02.100
I do.

240
00:13:02.187 --> 00:13:03.188
Maybe after I move in,
I'll talk to a professional


241
00:13:03.275 --> 00:13:04.537
about a skylight.

242
00:13:06.496 --> 00:13:07.715
Well,
you arethough.


243
00:13:07.802 --> 00:13:09.412
Pardon?

244
00:13:09.499 --> 00:13:10.282
Talking to a professional.

245
00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:14.547
You're a contractor?

246
00:13:14.635 --> 00:13:17.725
Oh my gosh,
of course.


247
00:13:17.812 --> 00:13:18.856
You're already thinking of how
to turn this into like


248
00:13:18.943 --> 00:13:21.163
a strip mall or a condo, right?

249
00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:22.251
I know your type.

250
00:13:22.338 --> 00:13:24.122
My type?

251
00:13:24.209 --> 00:13:25.776
You're just wanting
to flip it.


252
00:13:25.863 --> 00:13:28.649
You don't deserve it,
sorry.


253
00:13:28.736 --> 00:13:30.738
Well for a second there,
I was thinking of


254
00:13:30.825 --> 00:13:35.960
letting you have it
but now... no way.


255
00:13:36.047 --> 00:13:40.095
So unfortunately there
isn't a whole lot we can do.


256
00:13:40.182 --> 00:13:44.186
Mr. Noel doesn't remember which
agreement he signed first.


257
00:13:44.273 --> 00:13:48.059
According to the land
title office it comes down to...


258
00:13:48.146 --> 00:13:51.106
basically possession is 9/10ths
of the law.


259
00:13:51.193 --> 00:13:52.760
What?
What?


260
00:13:52.847 --> 00:13:54.805
So Ariel this is Mark.

261
00:13:54.892 --> 00:13:56.633
Mark this is Ariel.

262
00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:58.200
No, no... why are you-

263
00:13:58.287 --> 00:13:59.331
I don't want to know this
guy's name,


264
00:13:59.418 --> 00:14:01.943
I want him out of my house.

265
00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:03.640
Ditto, I mean what kind of
name is "Ariel" anyway?


266
00:14:03.727 --> 00:14:05.860
You can't leave,

267
00:14:05.947 --> 00:14:06.817
this guy is completely
unreasonable.
Ha!


268
00:14:06.904 --> 00:14:09.298
See what I mean?

269
00:14:09.385 --> 00:14:10.125
All the more reason to come to a
conclusion quick.


270
00:14:10.995 --> 00:14:13.476
Umm-hmm.

271
00:14:13.563 --> 00:14:17.349
- Uh, what are you doing?
- I'm going home.


272
00:14:17.436 --> 00:14:20.004
In the morning I'm gonna call a
lawyer to deal with all of this.


273
00:14:20.091 --> 00:14:22.441
Good idea,
I'm gonna do the same.


274
00:14:22.528 --> 00:14:24.835
Oh I don't think you
guys understand.


275
00:14:24.922 --> 00:14:27.838
The whole 9/10ths of the
law means whichever one of


276
00:14:27.925 --> 00:14:29.492
you leaves
the property first...


277
00:14:29.579 --> 00:14:32.582
forfeits your right to it.

278
00:14:32.669 --> 00:14:34.323
We have to stay here?

279
00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:36.499
Yes... negotiate!

280
00:14:36.586 --> 00:14:38.240
No, no, no, no... can't we...
can't we...


281
00:14:38.327 --> 00:14:40.285
at least go get stuff?

282
00:14:40.372 --> 00:14:41.286
I thought you were made
for cottage life?


283
00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:48.598
I mean like
food and...


284
00:14:48.685 --> 00:14:52.167
toilet paper.

285
00:14:52.254 --> 00:14:55.431
Can you go back to my place and
get me a few basics...


286
00:14:55.518 --> 00:14:59.087
You know like moisturizer
and mascara


287
00:14:59.174 --> 00:15:00.915
and maybe a few groceries.

288
00:15:01.002 --> 00:15:03.265
Yeah you know what?

289
00:15:03.352 --> 00:15:04.396
I think I need a few staples too
for like say a couple


290
00:15:04.483 --> 00:15:06.050
days or a week.

291
00:15:06.137 --> 00:15:08.183
A week?!

292
00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:09.793
Did you say a week?

293
00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:13.057
Yeah.No.

294
00:15:13.144 --> 00:15:15.059
If you don't decide in a week,

295
00:15:15.146 --> 00:15:17.714
the owner will put this cottage
back on the market-


296
00:15:17.801 --> 00:15:19.585
With the condition that neither
one of you can purchase it.


297
00:15:19.672 --> 00:15:21.805
Those were his terms.

298
00:15:21.892 --> 00:15:24.155
What about your commission,
yeah?


299
00:15:24.242 --> 00:15:26.767
Don't you want to stay here and
make sure that I get it?


300
00:15:26.854 --> 00:15:29.421
Funny thing-

301
00:15:29.508 --> 00:15:31.119
We actually both get
a full commission.


302
00:15:31.206 --> 00:15:33.338
Merry Christmas to us!

303
00:15:33.425 --> 00:15:36.167
What?!

304
00:15:36.254 --> 00:15:37.821
Oh don't forget...
You cango outside...


305
00:15:37.908 --> 00:15:39.649
but just be mindful of where
the property line ends


306
00:15:39.736 --> 00:15:42.608
between the reindeer
and the candy canes.


307
00:15:42.695 --> 00:15:45.481
Yeah, the offer expires on the
day after Christmas so...


308
00:15:45.568 --> 00:15:47.135
may the best person win!

309
00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:51.792
Oh um...

310
00:15:51.879 --> 00:15:53.445
And watch out for the bears.

311
00:15:53.532 --> 00:15:55.273
Bears?

312
00:16:10.027 --> 00:16:12.856
How am I supposed to get
any work done here?


313
00:16:12.943 --> 00:16:16.120
Looks like you've got
everything you need


314
00:16:16.207 --> 00:16:19.907
and there iselectricity
just in case you were wondering.


315
00:16:19.994 --> 00:16:22.431
Umm-hmm, very funny.

316
00:16:22.518 --> 00:16:24.650
I mean how am I supposed
to do research?


317
00:16:24.737 --> 00:16:26.348
Well I suggest you get in your
car and you


318
00:16:26.435 --> 00:16:29.133
drive two hours thatway.

319
00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:30.961
You wish.

320
00:16:31.048 --> 00:16:31.179
Alright, let's figure out
sleeping arrangements.


321
00:16:36.401 --> 00:16:38.055
How does your boyfriend or
husband feel about you


322
00:16:38.142 --> 00:16:40.144
spending the night with me?

323
00:16:40.231 --> 00:16:42.973
I'm not spending the night
with you.


324
00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:44.192
Besides, I don't have a husband
or boyfriend.


325
00:16:44.279 --> 00:16:47.238
Nor do I.

326
00:16:47.325 --> 00:16:48.152
You know you're going to have to
work a lotharder


327
00:16:48.239 --> 00:16:50.154
if you want to wear me down.

328
00:16:50.241 --> 00:16:51.634
Oh, well I guess
we'll have to wait and see.


329
00:16:51.721 --> 00:16:53.592
I'm taking this room.

330
00:16:53.679 --> 00:16:55.681
Oh, what if I want to
sleep in here?


331
00:16:55.768 --> 00:16:58.032
Well possession is 9/10ths of
the law and... oh look!


332
00:16:58.119 --> 00:17:00.382
I'm inside.

333
00:17:28.018 --> 00:17:29.977
Yeah?

334
00:17:30.064 --> 00:17:32.240
Hey little brother,
where are you?


335
00:17:32.327 --> 00:17:33.719
I'm in your office.

336
00:17:33.806 --> 00:17:35.069
Great.
Is dad still there?


337
00:17:35.156 --> 00:17:38.246
Hang on.What do you need?

338
00:17:38.333 --> 00:17:38.899
I've got Mark on the
phone; he says


339
00:17:38.986 --> 00:17:40.291
he has got a surprise for us.

340
00:17:40.378 --> 00:17:42.728
Hey Dad.Hey, son.

341
00:17:42.815 --> 00:17:46.384
Trevor, Dad, pack your
overnight bags, you're coming up


342
00:17:46.471 --> 00:17:49.910
- to your cottage.
- Our cottage?


343
00:17:49.997 --> 00:17:53.391
Yes, I'm keeping my
promise but...


344
00:17:53.478 --> 00:17:55.698
But what?

345
00:17:55.785 --> 00:17:59.528
Yeah, about that... you are
never gonna believe this.


346
00:18:18.982 --> 00:18:21.811
So I'm gonna need you guys to
help me like wear her down.


347
00:18:21.898 --> 00:18:22.681
Hey, so what's
she like?


348
00:18:24.466 --> 00:18:25.423
I don't know...

349
00:18:29.297 --> 00:18:31.647
She's pretty...

350
00:18:31.734 --> 00:18:33.431
Kind of a smarty-pants...

351
00:18:33.518 --> 00:18:34.780
Pretty...

352
00:18:38.871 --> 00:18:39.089
Sounds like your type!

353
00:18:39.176 --> 00:18:40.917
Yeah
she does.


354
00:18:41.004 --> 00:18:41.962
Okay son,
we'll leave


355
00:18:42.049 --> 00:18:42.745
first thing
in the morning.


356
00:18:42.832 --> 00:18:45.356
Awesome, alright!

357
00:18:47.837 --> 00:18:49.970
Oh! This isn't
the bathroom.


358
00:18:50.057 --> 00:18:50.840
No, that'd be the one
with the sink.


359
00:19:07.857 --> 00:19:08.510
"Don't use, water is
shut off."


360
00:19:16.561 --> 00:19:18.259
One towel?

361
00:19:18.346 --> 00:19:20.478
Dibs.

362
00:19:29.618 --> 00:19:32.360
Hey!
What's the problem?


363
00:19:32.447 --> 00:19:34.449
The water isn't on,
and I need water.


364
00:19:34.536 --> 00:19:37.278
Go turn it on.

365
00:19:37.365 --> 00:19:38.801
I looked in the bathroom and the
shut-off valve isn't there.


366
00:19:38.888 --> 00:19:41.108
Oh, it must be
under the house.


367
00:19:41.195 --> 00:19:44.285
Okay, I'll wait.

368
00:19:44.372 --> 00:19:47.723
Hmm, this looks like
a good book.


369
00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:49.768
What are you doing?

370
00:19:49.855 --> 00:19:53.337
What does it look like?

371
00:19:53.424 --> 00:19:55.557
"Marley was dead to begin with,

372
00:19:55.644 --> 00:19:58.473
there is no doubt about that
whatsoever."


373
00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:00.257
Ugh, that's sad.

374
00:20:02.564 --> 00:20:05.175
Look...

375
00:20:05.262 --> 00:20:07.960
The way I see it,
you have two options...


376
00:20:08.048 --> 00:20:12.443
You can get in your car,
go home to your working bathroom


377
00:20:12.530 --> 00:20:15.490
and you know whatever Christmas
festivities that you do


378
00:20:15.577 --> 00:20:18.841
which is my recommendation...

379
00:20:18.928 --> 00:20:23.237
Or you can stay here and look
outside for the shut-off valve


380
00:20:23.324 --> 00:20:24.412
with the bears.

381
00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:27.806
You're not a very nice guy,
are you?


382
00:20:30.287 --> 00:20:31.680
I'm verynice.

383
00:20:42.386 --> 00:20:45.172
The way I see it...

384
00:20:45.259 --> 00:20:46.869
sooner or later, you're gonna
need to use the bathroom too.


385
00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:51.526
I'll wait.

386
00:20:51.613 --> 00:20:53.180
Fine.

387
00:20:56.183 --> 00:20:57.662
Have you seen any flashlights
lying around?


388
00:20:57.749 --> 00:21:00.230
It's daylight.

389
00:21:00.317 --> 00:21:01.405
Yeah, but it's dark under the
house and you gotta give


390
00:21:01.492 --> 00:21:02.276
the snakes a chance to scatter.

391
00:21:02.363 --> 00:21:04.060
Snakes?!

392
00:21:04.147 --> 00:21:06.889
Yeah, loads of them.

393
00:21:06.976 --> 00:21:09.021
Oh my...

394
00:21:09.109 --> 00:21:10.588
There might be one in my car.

395
00:21:10.675 --> 00:21:12.242
Okay, good. Let's go.

396
00:21:12.329 --> 00:21:14.157
Let me get my winter stuff.

397
00:21:25.516 --> 00:21:27.257
Almost...

398
00:21:27.344 --> 00:21:28.998
Just a little farther...

399
00:21:43.708 --> 00:21:46.537
Got it!

400
00:21:46.624 --> 00:21:48.148
Nice try.

401
00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:52.108
It's gonna take
more than that!


402
00:22:01.465 --> 00:22:02.640
Is that a snake?

403
00:22:02.727 --> 00:22:04.599
No.

404
00:22:04.686 --> 00:22:05.904
A bear?

405
00:22:05.991 --> 00:22:07.906
No, not really.

406
00:22:13.303 --> 00:22:15.871
Oh.

407
00:22:15.958 --> 00:22:16.654
Are there really snakes and
bears out here?


408
00:22:16.741 --> 00:22:18.787
Oh yeah.

409
00:22:18.874 --> 00:22:21.398
But don't worry,
I'll protect you.


410
00:22:21.485 --> 00:22:24.096
Really?

411
00:22:24.184 --> 00:22:25.533
I mean I'll probably negotiate
something first,


412
00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:26.969
but yeah probably.

413
00:22:33.367 --> 00:22:34.281
Do you see any snakes?

414
00:22:40.983 --> 00:22:43.115
Okay.

415
00:22:43.203 --> 00:22:44.943
That's it?

416
00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:46.728
That's it.

417
00:22:46.815 --> 00:22:49.165
Thanks.

418
00:22:49.252 --> 00:22:51.211
Um...

419
00:22:51.298 --> 00:22:53.430
I just remembered
something, hold on.


420
00:22:53.517 --> 00:22:54.605
I've got some food
in the car.


421
00:22:59.958 --> 00:23:02.047
Thank you.

422
00:23:02.134 --> 00:23:02.831
It's not much but
at least it's something.


423
00:23:02.918 --> 00:23:03.875
No, thank you
for sharing.


424
00:23:03.962 --> 00:23:06.051
You didn't have to.

425
00:23:06.138 --> 00:23:09.054
Well, I couldn't
leave you hungry.


426
00:23:09.141 --> 00:23:11.013
Starios, right?

427
00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:12.232
You're from Charlotte
too?


428
00:23:12.319 --> 00:23:13.929
Best marinara!

429
00:23:14.016 --> 00:23:15.800
Yeah.

430
00:23:15.887 --> 00:23:16.888
So are you uh...
ready for Christmas?


431
00:23:16.975 --> 00:23:19.935
No.

432
00:23:20.022 --> 00:23:21.371
I mean I'm not
a grinch or anything.


433
00:23:24.896 --> 00:23:26.507
Bring on the Grinch!

434
00:23:26.594 --> 00:23:27.943
I just...

435
00:23:28.030 --> 00:23:32.469
I'm not really into Christmas.

436
00:23:32.556 --> 00:23:34.036
All you have to do
is find someone who hates


437
00:23:34.123 --> 00:23:36.691
Christmas and write
about them.


438
00:23:36.778 --> 00:23:39.302
Really?
How come?


439
00:23:39.389 --> 00:23:42.653
I used to like it...

440
00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:44.525
anyway I don't want to
talk about it.


441
00:23:44.612 --> 00:23:47.136
Okay.

442
00:23:47.223 --> 00:23:49.138
How 'bout you?
What do you do?


443
00:23:49.225 --> 00:23:50.922
You said you were working
on an article?


444
00:23:51.009 --> 00:23:53.360
Are you a writer?I am.

445
00:23:53.447 --> 00:23:54.186
I work for
"Sweet Home" magazine.


446
00:23:54.274 --> 00:23:57.668
Oh, interesting.

447
00:23:57.755 --> 00:23:58.365
And you said you had
some research you were doing?


448
00:23:58.452 --> 00:24:00.367
Yeah.

449
00:24:00.454 --> 00:24:03.370
How's that going?

450
00:24:03.457 --> 00:24:05.023
You know...

451
00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:08.418
I may have found another way...

452
00:24:08.505 --> 00:24:09.854
So I won't have to get in my
car and drive home.


453
00:24:09.941 --> 00:24:12.683
Oh... good, good.

454
00:24:12.770 --> 00:24:15.207
Yeah.

455
00:24:15.295 --> 00:24:17.862
So what made you want to
buy this place?


456
00:24:17.949 --> 00:24:19.690
Well, it's not really
for me as much.


457
00:24:19.777 --> 00:24:22.127
It's mainly for my
family.


458
00:24:22.214 --> 00:24:24.652
I'm only here for 3 more weeks

459
00:24:24.739 --> 00:24:27.350
and then I go to Australia
for 2 years.


460
00:24:27.437 --> 00:24:29.483
Wow!

461
00:24:29.570 --> 00:24:30.832
I'm an on-site architect
for a building


462
00:24:30.919 --> 00:24:32.181
my brother and I designed.

463
00:24:32.268 --> 00:24:34.226
Wow again.

464
00:24:34.314 --> 00:24:36.185
So you're not
a contractor.


465
00:24:36.272 --> 00:24:38.492
I mean I was.

466
00:24:38.579 --> 00:24:41.886
My father has been a contractor
for 30-plus years,


467
00:24:41.973 --> 00:24:44.933
and I was following
in his footsteps.


468
00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:47.196
But, you know, he had better
plans for my brother and I.


469
00:24:47.283 --> 00:24:49.590
Nice.Yeah.

470
00:24:49.677 --> 00:24:52.593
Yeah this job in Sydney's
like a dream come true for me.


471
00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:53.942
I really can't wait.

472
00:24:56.336 --> 00:24:58.642
Um, hey can I use your phone?

473
00:24:58.729 --> 00:24:59.904
Mine's dead.

474
00:24:59.991 --> 00:25:02.167
Really?

475
00:25:02.254 --> 00:25:05.997
So is mine.Really?

476
00:25:06.084 --> 00:25:08.783
You were just talking on it like

477
00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:11.438
No.
No, I don't think so.


478
00:25:11.525 --> 00:25:11.960
You must have heard me
talking to myself.


479
00:25:15.442 --> 00:25:17.182
Well did you bring
charging cables?


480
00:25:17.269 --> 00:25:19.576
No.
No, I didn't.


481
00:25:19.663 --> 00:25:22.710
Oh, okay.

482
00:25:22.797 --> 00:25:25.408
I see what's goingon here.

483
00:25:25.495 --> 00:25:28.455
You probably called your family
and they are on their way.


484
00:25:28.542 --> 00:25:30.370
Hey, I wasn't finished.Well, I am!

485
00:25:30.457 --> 00:25:32.546
I can't believe I shared
my only meal with you,


486
00:25:32.633 --> 00:25:36.637
you ungrateful person you!

487
00:25:36.724 --> 00:25:39.640
I wasgrateful until you
took it away.


488
00:25:39.727 --> 00:25:42.251
You can towel off
using toilet paper.


489
00:25:42.338 --> 00:25:44.514
I get dibs on
the only towel.


490
00:25:44.601 --> 00:25:46.037
I hope you miss Christmas.

491
00:25:47.822 --> 00:25:50.302
I hope you miss Christmas!

492
00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:52.043
I heard you the
first time, grinch!


493
00:26:44.444 --> 00:26:47.882
Oh, she's so pretty.

494
00:26:53.322 --> 00:26:54.410
It's me.
Listen, I need your help.


495
00:27:44.939 --> 00:27:46.462
Hey!
Oh!


496
00:27:46.549 --> 00:27:48.682
Whoa!

497
00:27:48.769 --> 00:27:50.814
That's twice I've
saved your life now.


498
00:27:50.901 --> 00:27:52.381
Well technically the
first time I was in


499
00:27:52.468 --> 00:27:54.122
no real danger.

500
00:27:54.209 --> 00:27:56.080
Well, you thought
you were.


501
00:27:57.647 --> 00:27:59.214
I found these
in my closet.


502
00:27:59.301 --> 00:28:00.781
Shouldn't they go on
a tree?


503
00:28:00.868 --> 00:28:03.348
Well, we don't have one
so I'm improvising.


504
00:28:03.435 --> 00:28:05.481
You really like Christmas,
don't you?


505
00:28:05.568 --> 00:28:09.180
That and maybe I can Christmas
you out of here.


506
00:28:09.267 --> 00:28:11.313
Nah, I'll just
ignore it.


507
00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:12.880
So what is with you
and Christmas anyway?


508
00:28:12.967 --> 00:28:15.491
It's complicated.

509
00:28:15.578 --> 00:28:16.318
Well maybe if you
weren't such a grouch


510
00:28:16.405 --> 00:28:19.060
spending it alone...

511
00:28:19.147 --> 00:28:20.452
Who says I will?

512
00:28:25.719 --> 00:28:26.589
Mark, we're here!

513
00:28:26.676 --> 00:28:28.243
No phone, huh?

514
00:28:31.072 --> 00:28:32.813
Now who could that be?

515
00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:34.771
Dad!
Hey, what do ya think?


516
00:28:34.858 --> 00:28:35.859
This is good,right?

517
00:28:35.946 --> 00:28:37.557
Lookin' good!You too!

518
00:28:42.170 --> 00:28:43.606
Come on in.

519
00:28:43.693 --> 00:28:46.304
You're gonna
love this place.


520
00:28:46.391 --> 00:28:48.437
Make yourselves at home.

521
00:28:48.524 --> 00:28:50.482
Ariel...

522
00:28:50.570 --> 00:28:53.834
Hi!
And you are?


523
00:28:53.921 --> 00:28:56.619
I'm Duke.Nice to meet you.

524
00:28:56.706 --> 00:28:58.186
- This is my son, Trevor.
- Hi, nice to meet you.


525
00:28:58.273 --> 00:29:00.014
And if course you know
my other son.


526
00:29:00.101 --> 00:29:03.365
I do.

527
00:29:04.932 --> 00:29:07.325
Forgive my son.

528
00:29:07.412 --> 00:29:09.676
What do you mean?

529
00:29:09.763 --> 00:29:11.460
Everyone can see
you belong in this place.


530
00:29:14.115 --> 00:29:17.553
Oh...

531
00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:20.469
- You're not helping.
- Sure he is!


532
00:29:20.556 --> 00:29:21.601
Come on in,
I'm so glad you came.


533
00:29:21.688 --> 00:29:22.079
I wish I could offer you
something,


534
00:29:22.166 --> 00:29:23.733
but all we have is jam.

535
00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:25.561
Well let's see if
we can fix that.


536
00:29:28.956 --> 00:29:32.568
Wow!

537
00:29:32.655 --> 00:29:34.962
What all did you bring?

538
00:29:35.049 --> 00:29:39.793
We uh Hendersons may not look it
but we can cook.


539
00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:41.664
Well Mark's not very good but
Trevor and I can hold our own.


540
00:29:44.275 --> 00:29:46.103
We hope he learns overseas.

541
00:29:46.190 --> 00:29:48.540
Mark was talking
about Australia.


542
00:29:48.628 --> 00:29:48.932
Well really Ishould be
the one who's going.


543
00:29:49.019 --> 00:29:51.152
Oh?

544
00:29:51.239 --> 00:29:53.371
Trevor is also an architect.

545
00:29:53.458 --> 00:29:55.635
They worked on the designs
together and now Trevor wants


546
00:29:55.722 --> 00:29:58.333
to go almost as badly
as Mark does.


547
00:29:58.420 --> 00:29:59.639
This is a lovely cottage here,
Ariel.


548
00:29:59.726 --> 00:30:01.684
It suits you.

549
00:30:01.771 --> 00:30:04.687
Dad!

550
00:30:04.774 --> 00:30:06.384
You must be starving.
Come on, let's unpack.


551
00:30:06.471 --> 00:30:08.299
Oh, this won't do.

552
00:30:08.386 --> 00:30:09.736
Homemade cookies
for Christmas.


553
00:30:09.823 --> 00:30:11.868
You need that.

554
00:30:11.955 --> 00:30:14.523
Well if you make 'em,
we'll eat 'em!


555
00:30:14.610 --> 00:30:16.046
Dad, what are you doing?

556
00:30:16.133 --> 00:30:17.787
Problems?

557
00:30:17.874 --> 00:30:20.964
No, everything's
just fine.


558
00:30:21.051 --> 00:30:22.836
She's the enemy,okay?

559
00:30:22.923 --> 00:30:24.751
What are you doing
helping her?


560
00:30:24.838 --> 00:30:26.927
We aren't gonna starve her out
on Christmas, are we?


561
00:30:28.929 --> 00:30:31.279
Pantry!

562
00:30:31.366 --> 00:30:34.935
Uh, seems like your plan
kinda backfired, huh?


563
00:30:39.722 --> 00:30:41.332
- Look at that!
- It's gorgeous!


564
00:30:41.419 --> 00:30:42.420
It's beautiful!

565
00:30:45.423 --> 00:30:50.254
Ariel!

566
00:30:50.341 --> 00:30:52.561
You used my cord to charge your
phone, didn't you?


567
00:30:52.648 --> 00:30:53.997
How could I?

568
00:30:54.084 --> 00:30:57.044
You didn't bring one.

569
00:30:57.131 --> 00:31:01.570
Now who could that be?
Mom! Dad!


570
00:31:01.657 --> 00:31:07.619
Oh!
Hi!!!


571
00:31:07.707 --> 00:31:09.534
It's so beautiful!

572
00:31:09.621 --> 00:31:10.971
This looks
amazing!


573
00:31:11.058 --> 00:31:13.669
Oh my gosh!
Honey grab that.


574
00:31:13.756 --> 00:31:14.322
We canceled all
our plans to be here.


575
00:31:14.409 --> 00:31:16.803
Well played.

576
00:31:16.890 --> 00:31:20.894
Oh! This is beautiful!
Honey, it is gorgeous!


577
00:31:20.981 --> 00:31:23.635
Are you sure
she's the enemy?


578
00:31:23.723 --> 00:31:24.811
Oh my goodness!
This is amazing!


579
00:31:24.898 --> 00:31:26.813
It's beautiful!

580
00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:28.075
Ariel, I love it!

581
00:31:28.162 --> 00:31:29.685
Hello!

582
00:31:29.772 --> 00:31:31.861
Mom, Dad, Jasmine...

583
00:31:31.948 --> 00:31:34.516
these are the Hendersons.

584
00:31:34.603 --> 00:31:37.475
This is Trevor and his father,
Duke.


585
00:31:37.562 --> 00:31:38.128
So very nice
to meet you, Duke.


586
00:31:38.215 --> 00:31:39.477
Hi.

587
00:31:39.564 --> 00:31:41.871
And this is Mark.

588
00:31:41.958 --> 00:31:43.525
- Hi.
- Hi!


589
00:31:43.612 --> 00:31:45.309
These are my parents...
Peter and Amy Colt,


590
00:31:45.396 --> 00:31:46.049
and my sister, Jasmine.

591
00:31:46.136 --> 00:31:47.355
Hey!

592
00:31:47.442 --> 00:31:48.791
Ariel and Jasmine?

593
00:31:48.878 --> 00:31:51.054
Eh, it's a thing.

594
00:31:51.141 --> 00:31:52.142
- Trevor.
- What?


595
00:31:52.229 --> 00:31:53.796
If we'd had a son,

596
00:31:53.883 --> 00:31:54.275
his name would have been
"Snow White."


597
00:31:54.362 --> 00:31:56.016
"Aladdin."

598
00:32:00.629 --> 00:32:02.718
It's a pleasure to meet you.

599
00:32:02.805 --> 00:32:03.850
Looks like we're gonna be
spending Christmas together.


600
00:32:03.937 --> 00:32:06.156
Glad you're all here.

601
00:32:06.243 --> 00:32:06.591
Let's get
ready for Christmas!


602
00:32:06.678 --> 00:32:08.506
Come on!

603
00:32:08.593 --> 00:32:10.987
Let's see what
we've got over here.


604
00:32:11.074 --> 00:32:13.207
Be careful,
it's heavy.


605
00:32:13.294 --> 00:32:15.209
We have enough food
to feed an army.


606
00:32:15.296 --> 00:32:18.038
We have bacon in a bucket.

607
00:32:18.125 --> 00:32:19.735
What are you doing?

608
00:32:19.822 --> 00:32:20.214
They're gonna ruin
our Christmas.


609
00:32:23.783 --> 00:32:29.353
- Okay, hmm...
- Ooh, pantry.


610
00:32:37.448 --> 00:32:39.320
No, I'm not working on it

611
00:32:39.407 --> 00:32:42.453
because it is a terrible idea.

612
00:33:01.081 --> 00:33:02.038
So you play guitar?

613
00:33:02.125 --> 00:33:03.692
Yeah, you?

614
00:33:03.779 --> 00:33:06.826
Kind of.
I mostly sing.


615
00:33:06.913 --> 00:33:08.828
Cool, I'll bet you know
this one here.


616
00:33:13.267 --> 00:33:15.182
Oh, you've got to
be kidding me.


617
00:33:20.622 --> 00:33:23.146
I don't get it, I thought this
is what you wanted.


618
00:33:23.233 --> 00:33:25.279
Yeah, not until Christmas Eve
and not like this.


619
00:33:25.366 --> 00:33:27.585
Oh, the timing's off.

620
00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:35.637
I got to go join them,
I'm so sorry.


621
00:33:42.078 --> 00:33:43.210
I thought you
loved Christmas.


622
00:33:43.297 --> 00:33:45.734
I do.

623
00:33:51.914 --> 00:33:54.047
That was good, guys.

624
00:33:54.134 --> 00:33:55.787
What's the matter?

625
00:33:55.875 --> 00:33:57.615
Did your plan
backfire?


626
00:33:57.702 --> 00:34:01.532
Oh whatever.

627
00:34:08.278 --> 00:34:09.976
I'm gonna get some
fresh clothes.


628
00:34:10.063 --> 00:34:11.586
Who's the grinch now?

629
00:34:25.078 --> 00:34:26.470
This is terrible.

630
00:34:29.996 --> 00:34:32.259
Oh, hey!

631
00:34:32.346 --> 00:34:34.217
I didn't know you
were in here.


632
00:34:34.304 --> 00:34:39.005
I can play Jingle Bells
sort of... almost...


633
00:34:39.092 --> 00:34:40.789
Is it too late to add a guitar
to my Christmas list?


634
00:34:43.183 --> 00:34:44.662
What are you doing?

635
00:34:44.749 --> 00:34:45.359
Just working.

636
00:34:45.446 --> 00:34:47.752
Well...

637
00:34:47.839 --> 00:34:50.755
Well, Mom wants us to find some
pinecones...


638
00:34:50.842 --> 00:34:52.714
Something about making
a centerpiece.


639
00:34:52.801 --> 00:34:53.845
I figured you'd be
all over that, you know?


640
00:34:53.933 --> 00:34:54.890
Making and not buying.

641
00:34:57.371 --> 00:34:58.415
What are you writing?

642
00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:06.510
"Behind a
charming and attractive facade
lies a grouchy man.


643
00:35:06.597 --> 00:35:10.558
We'll call him
Mark the grinch."


644
00:35:10.645 --> 00:35:14.605
Wait, Mark?
ThisMark?


645
00:35:14.692 --> 00:35:15.998
Jeremy sprung an assignment on
me last-minute.


646
00:35:16.085 --> 00:35:18.131
It's due Christmas Eve.

647
00:35:18.218 --> 00:35:19.088
And you're using Mark
as your subject?


648
00:35:21.786 --> 00:35:23.353
He doesn't like Christmas?
- Nope.


649
00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:25.921
Huh.

650
00:35:26.008 --> 00:35:26.791
Does Mark know that you're
writing about him?


651
00:35:26.878 --> 00:35:29.403
Nope.

652
00:35:29.490 --> 00:35:32.797
Well, let's hope he doesn't read
"Sweet Home" magazine.


653
00:35:32.884 --> 00:35:35.539
Ugh...

654
00:35:46.898 --> 00:35:47.812
Hey!

655
00:35:47.899 --> 00:35:49.466
Hey.

656
00:35:49.553 --> 00:35:50.206
Mind if I
sit down?


657
00:35:50.293 --> 00:35:51.642
Be my guest.

658
00:35:51.729 --> 00:35:54.036
Hmm...

659
00:35:59.215 --> 00:36:00.956
I hope you two don't reach an

660
00:36:01.043 --> 00:36:03.176
agreement until
afterChristmas.


661
00:36:03.263 --> 00:36:05.091
How come?

662
00:36:05.178 --> 00:36:07.006
I know you're both doing
your best


663
00:36:07.093 --> 00:36:11.793
andyour worst
to get this place


664
00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:12.968
but putting that all aside

665
00:36:13.055 --> 00:36:14.187
I think this will be

666
00:36:14.274 --> 00:36:16.537
very good for Mark.

667
00:36:16.624 --> 00:36:20.019
What do you mean?

668
00:36:20.106 --> 00:36:21.107
I think he likes you.

669
00:36:21.194 --> 00:36:22.934
No way.

670
00:36:23.022 --> 00:36:24.501
We couldn't be
more different.


671
00:36:24.588 --> 00:36:28.114
I don't happen to
agree with that.


672
00:36:28.201 --> 00:36:30.290
But in any case, it's good for
him to be around happy people.


673
00:36:34.424 --> 00:36:37.601
So why doesn't
he like Christmas?


674
00:36:37.688 --> 00:36:39.690
It wasn't always
the case,


675
00:36:39.777 --> 00:36:42.041
he used to love it.

676
00:36:42.128 --> 00:36:44.130
So then what happened?

677
00:36:48.569 --> 00:36:50.875
His mom, my wife...

678
00:36:53.530 --> 00:36:56.925
passed away 6 months ago

679
00:36:57.012 --> 00:36:58.100
so this will be the first

680
00:36:58.187 --> 00:36:59.580
Christmas without his mother.

681
00:36:59.667 --> 00:37:02.496
I'm sorry,
I didn't know.


682
00:37:02.583 --> 00:37:04.106
Oh, thank you.

683
00:37:07.066 --> 00:37:09.981
I've tried talking to him about
it but...


684
00:37:10.069 --> 00:37:10.808
he was always closer to
his mother.


685
00:37:15.987 --> 00:37:18.947
Maybe he'll talk to you.

686
00:37:19.034 --> 00:37:21.515
Uh...

687
00:37:34.919 --> 00:37:36.791
Hi, Kathy.

688
00:37:36.878 --> 00:37:39.185
Are you serious?

689
00:37:39.272 --> 00:37:40.229
I'm not scheduled to be in
Australia for


690
00:37:40.316 --> 00:37:43.189
another two and a half weeks.

691
00:37:43.276 --> 00:37:46.801
No, no... don't cancel,
I'll make it happen.


692
00:37:46.888 --> 00:37:50.761
Yes.
No, I'll be there.


693
00:37:50.848 --> 00:37:54.548
Okay, I'll leave on the 25th.

694
00:37:54.635 --> 00:37:57.203
Merry Christmas.

695
00:37:59.422 --> 00:38:00.380
Was that Kathy?

696
00:38:00.467 --> 00:38:04.514
Yeah, the uh...

697
00:38:04.601 --> 00:38:09.345
investor is arriving 2 weeks
early to approve the designs.


698
00:38:09.432 --> 00:38:11.130
What the-
That's Christmas.


699
00:38:11.217 --> 00:38:13.306
I know.

700
00:38:13.393 --> 00:38:14.394
And you have to be
there for that?


701
00:38:14.481 --> 00:38:17.266
Yeah, apparently.

702
00:38:17.353 --> 00:38:19.442
I tried to push it but
it was just-


703
00:38:19.529 --> 00:38:22.358
Mark, this our first
Christmas without Mom.


704
00:38:22.445 --> 00:38:23.054
Do you think I want
to miss it?


705
00:38:23.142 --> 00:38:25.100
You can't say "no?"

706
00:38:25.187 --> 00:38:29.583
No...
Not really, I mean it's...


707
00:38:29.670 --> 00:38:30.236
Look, this is our first
job with them.


708
00:38:33.630 --> 00:38:35.284
I feel like this could really
help transition us


709
00:38:35.371 --> 00:38:39.332
to designing signature
buildings.


710
00:38:39.419 --> 00:38:41.943
You know, I can't decide if
you're doing this because


711
00:38:42.030 --> 00:38:44.902
all you care about is your
career or because it's just


712
00:38:44.989 --> 00:38:47.209
easier for you to just bail
on Christmas.


713
00:38:55.174 --> 00:38:57.828
Look...
just make sure he's okay.


714
00:39:13.235 --> 00:39:14.932
Give me a minute.

715
00:39:15.019 --> 00:39:16.804
Yeah.

716
00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:24.377
I'm sorry,
this is not what...


717
00:39:24.464 --> 00:39:25.073
Can I-

718
00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:26.161
No, I'm okay.

719
00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:31.035
Thank you.

720
00:39:43.265 --> 00:39:45.876
What'd you
say to him?


721
00:39:45.963 --> 00:39:49.576
Nothing.

722
00:39:49.663 --> 00:39:52.840
Well this just means that all
you have to do is bide


723
00:39:52.927 --> 00:39:56.713
your time until Christmas
and the place is yours.


724
00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:58.237
I guess.

725
00:40:03.067 --> 00:40:04.373
Are you sure?
I can sleep on a couch.


726
00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:06.027
Or me.
I don't mind.


727
00:40:06.114 --> 00:40:08.072
No, no, no.Thanks.

728
00:40:08.159 --> 00:40:09.509
Um, I was gonna get
some work done.


729
00:40:09.596 --> 00:40:11.554
Now?

730
00:40:11.641 --> 00:40:14.731
Yeah, yeah just a bit.
Alright.


731
00:40:17.168 --> 00:40:18.996
What's going on?

732
00:40:19.083 --> 00:40:21.347
They want him there on
the 27th.


733
00:40:24.698 --> 00:40:25.699
That means he has to leave
on Christmas.


734
00:40:25.786 --> 00:40:27.135
Yeah.

735
00:40:45.371 --> 00:40:46.720
I haven't eaten like this
since I graduated.


736
00:40:51.942 --> 00:40:54.293
My goodness,
beautiful! Beautiful!


737
00:40:54.380 --> 00:40:56.773
You guys, I don't remember the
last time I slept so well.


738
00:40:56.860 --> 00:40:59.385
These are so good, Mrs. Colt.

739
00:40:59.472 --> 00:41:01.865
Oh, I'm so glad
you're enjoying them!


740
00:41:01.952 --> 00:41:03.214
Please call me "Amy,"
his mother's "Mrs. Colt."


741
00:41:04.433 --> 00:41:05.695
What's in it?

742
00:41:05.782 --> 00:41:08.568
Oh she will
never tell you.


743
00:41:08.655 --> 00:41:10.352
Isn't that right, Hummingbird?
- That's right, Honeybunch.


744
00:41:10.439 --> 00:41:13.747
So you guys, I have an idea.

745
00:41:13.834 --> 00:41:15.705
My great-grandparents are
from Germany and they celebrated


746
00:41:15.792 --> 00:41:17.664
Christmas on the 24th.

747
00:41:17.751 --> 00:41:19.709
- That's true, when we were kids

748
00:41:19.796 --> 00:41:21.929
we used to go their house on
Christmas Eve.


749
00:41:22.016 --> 00:41:23.800
So I was thinking this
year,


750
00:41:23.887 --> 00:41:26.673
maybe we could do the same and
celebrate on the 24th.


751
00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:27.935
Whole turkey dinner with
all the fixin's?


752
00:41:28.022 --> 00:41:30.372
Yeah, what do you think?

753
00:41:30.459 --> 00:41:31.330
Yeah, that would be awesome!

754
00:41:31.417 --> 00:41:32.766
Sounds great!

755
00:41:32.853 --> 00:41:34.507
Mark?

756
00:41:34.594 --> 00:41:37.292
Sure.

757
00:41:37.379 --> 00:41:39.947
That's a wonderful idea,
sweetheart.


758
00:41:40.034 --> 00:41:42.515
Alright, you don't have
to ask me twice!


759
00:41:42.602 --> 00:41:45.169
All we need is
a Christmas tree.


760
00:41:45.256 --> 00:41:47.563
- I brought an axe!
- We own an axe?


761
00:41:47.650 --> 00:41:49.217
Seriously!

762
00:41:52.699 --> 00:41:55.223
- How far is the lake from here?
- Couple miles I think.


763
00:41:55.310 --> 00:41:57.181
You know what?

764
00:41:57.268 --> 00:41:59.314
Regardless of who
gets this cottage,


765
00:41:59.401 --> 00:42:02.317
you and me...
we should come out fishing.


766
00:42:02.404 --> 00:42:04.406
Now you're speaking
my language!


767
00:42:04.493 --> 00:42:05.233
What do you think we
could find out here?


768
00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:06.974
Catfish mostly.

769
00:42:07.061 --> 00:42:08.889
What do you think?

770
00:42:08.976 --> 00:42:09.977
I'm thinking this spring,
we could hunt down


771
00:42:10.064 --> 00:42:10.717
some nice rainbow trout.

772
00:42:10.804 --> 00:42:13.546
Hmm.

773
00:42:13.633 --> 00:42:16.505
How long has Ariel been
looking to buy a cottage?


774
00:42:16.592 --> 00:42:19.073
To be honest,
I didn't know she was.


775
00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:21.858
So why do you think she
wants to get one?


776
00:42:21.945 --> 00:42:24.383
I think it has less to
do with that cottage,


777
00:42:24.470 --> 00:42:26.863
and more to do with the
kind of Christmas she wants.Oh?


778
00:42:26.950 --> 00:42:29.300
My parents made a huge
impression on her and their


779
00:42:29.388 --> 00:42:32.521
stories became kind of
a blueprint for her.


780
00:42:32.608 --> 00:42:33.957
I just worry that she'll miss
out on her perfect Christmas


781
00:42:34.044 --> 00:42:35.524
by trying re-create
my mother's.


782
00:42:35.611 --> 00:42:37.091
Hmm, yeah.

783
00:42:37.178 --> 00:42:41.487
This one.

784
00:42:41.574 --> 00:42:44.011
- Are you sure it's gonna fit?
- Of course.


785
00:42:44.098 --> 00:42:47.710
- Maybe we should look
for a smaller one.


786
00:42:47.797 --> 00:42:54.021
- Come on, Dad. This is it!
- Well, start chopping then!


787
00:42:54.108 --> 00:42:58.547
Trevor? Trevor!

788
00:42:58.634 --> 00:43:02.595
Trevor!
Trevor, Trevor...


789
00:43:02.682 --> 00:43:05.075
What's up?

790
00:43:05.162 --> 00:43:08.601
I have an idea,
and I need your help.


791
00:43:08.688 --> 00:43:10.472
Come on,
let's go!


792
00:43:10.559 --> 00:43:13.910
Okay, he's all yours Dad.

793
00:43:13.997 --> 00:43:15.608
We'll make it fit.
Follow me.


794
00:43:15.695 --> 00:43:18.611
Alright!

795
00:43:18.698 --> 00:43:20.700
No, I don't understand.

796
00:43:20.787 --> 00:43:21.440
I thought you wanted me to find
someone who


797
00:43:21.527 --> 00:43:24.704
didn't like Christmas.

798
00:43:24.791 --> 00:43:26.488
Ariel, I'm looking to do a piece
on people who don't even


799
00:43:26.575 --> 00:43:28.055
stop for Christmas.

800
00:43:28.142 --> 00:43:30.361
- Uh-huh?
- I'm lookin for a grinch


801
00:43:30.449 --> 00:43:31.362
- Um-hmm.
- A Scrooge and


802
00:43:31.450 --> 00:43:33.147
what you sent me was soft.

803
00:43:33.234 --> 00:43:37.717
Of course...
No, I'm stone cold, yes.


804
00:43:37.804 --> 00:43:39.022
Ariel-
Ariel: I'm cutthroat.


805
00:43:39.109 --> 00:43:39.762
Something that people would
want to click on,


806
00:43:39.849 --> 00:43:41.895
so don't pull any punches.

807
00:43:41.982 --> 00:43:45.159
Now can you do this or do I need
to get someone else?


808
00:43:45.246 --> 00:43:49.468
No!
I agree one-thousand percent.


809
00:43:49.555 --> 00:43:51.818
Yeah, thank you.

810
00:44:06.441 --> 00:44:09.183
Jeremy, leave me alone.

811
00:44:09.270 --> 00:44:10.793
In my pocket you go.

812
00:44:15.798 --> 00:44:18.453
Everything okay?

813
00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:21.412
Yeah, except we need to
make more decorations.


814
00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:23.458
Let's do it!

815
00:44:23.545 --> 00:44:25.939
Where's the basket?

816
00:44:26.026 --> 00:44:28.768
So this one then, right?

817
00:44:28.855 --> 00:44:31.161
But don't touch the mold because
you don't want that.


818
00:44:31.248 --> 00:44:35.339
Okay, l can we have
everyone's attention please?


819
00:44:35.426 --> 00:44:39.169
Christmas as you know wouldn't
be complete without presents so-


820
00:44:39.256 --> 00:44:40.780
I think you're really
gonna like this one, sis.


821
00:44:40.867 --> 00:44:42.912
Yes. Jasmine and I have
prepared a little


822
00:44:42.999 --> 00:44:46.089
Secret Santa game and
participation is mandatory.


823
00:44:46.176 --> 00:44:48.570
As are the rules
about the presents.


824
00:44:48.657 --> 00:44:50.964
It must be handmade
and found within


825
00:44:51.051 --> 00:44:52.008
the bounds of the
property.


826
00:44:54.489 --> 00:44:55.882
And no swapping!

827
00:44:55.969 --> 00:44:58.188
Okay!

828
00:44:58.275 --> 00:44:59.233
- Okay, is everyone ready?
- Let's do it!


829
00:44:59.320 --> 00:45:01.278
- Cool.
- Let's do it!


830
00:45:01.365 --> 00:45:02.497
If you pull your own name,
let me know.


831
00:45:05.152 --> 00:45:06.806
Good choice there.

832
00:45:06.893 --> 00:45:08.677
Alright,
I won't look.


833
00:45:08.764 --> 00:45:10.723
No cheating.

834
00:45:10.810 --> 00:45:12.507
- Don't tell.
- I'm not cheating!


835
00:45:12.594 --> 00:45:15.205
Thank you,
very much.


836
00:45:15.292 --> 00:45:17.947
Pick something good,
something good.


837
00:45:18.034 --> 00:45:20.297
Indeed.

838
00:45:20.384 --> 00:45:21.516
Of course,
one for me.Right.


839
00:45:26.869 --> 00:45:28.088
Okay.

840
00:45:34.660 --> 00:45:35.835
You know, if you get me you can
just skip making me a present


841
00:45:35.922 --> 00:45:37.488
and give me the cottage now.

842
00:45:37.576 --> 00:45:39.708
Not a chance.

843
00:45:39.795 --> 00:45:40.883
Besides why are you
counting me out?


844
00:45:40.970 --> 00:45:42.450
It's Christmas.

845
00:45:42.537 --> 00:45:43.843
I hear miracles
can happen.


846
00:45:50.327 --> 00:45:52.199
Yes.Bravo.

847
00:45:59.815 --> 00:46:01.556
I know that face.

848
00:46:01.643 --> 00:46:03.558
It's my
assignment.


849
00:46:03.645 --> 00:46:05.429
What the
Christmas feature?


850
00:46:05.516 --> 00:46:06.474
If you can
call it that.


851
00:46:06.561 --> 00:46:09.085
Oh, right.

852
00:46:09.172 --> 00:46:10.913
Jeremy wants me to write
something that if I don't


853
00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:12.349
I could lose my promotion.

854
00:46:12.436 --> 00:46:16.310
Or even my job.

855
00:46:16.397 --> 00:46:18.094
But you don't
want to write it.


856
00:46:18.181 --> 00:46:21.402
I don't know.

857
00:46:21.489 --> 00:46:24.579
Well...

858
00:46:24.666 --> 00:46:27.147
I know you'll do
the right thing.


859
00:46:27.234 --> 00:46:28.452
Because you
always do.


860
00:46:42.553 --> 00:46:44.860
Oh, they're done.

861
00:46:44.947 --> 00:46:46.993
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

862
00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:48.081
They're perfect.

863
00:46:53.695 --> 00:46:55.784
Are you using this?

864
00:46:55.871 --> 00:46:57.656
No, no, no.
It's all yours.


865
00:46:57.743 --> 00:46:58.700
I didn't know
you baked.


866
00:46:58.787 --> 00:47:00.571
What are you
making?


867
00:47:00.659 --> 00:47:02.573
Sorry, trade secrets.

868
00:47:18.807 --> 00:47:22.985
Uhhh.

869
00:47:23.072 --> 00:47:24.726
Hey, how's that Christmas
present going?


870
00:47:24.813 --> 00:47:27.076
Good.

871
00:47:27.163 --> 00:47:28.121
So what are you
gonna make for her?


872
00:47:28.208 --> 00:47:32.168
No idea.

873
00:47:32.255 --> 00:47:33.517
Wait, wait, wait.

874
00:47:33.604 --> 00:47:36.912
How did
you know?


875
00:47:36.999 --> 00:47:38.087
Don't tell me you and
Jasmine have been


876
00:47:38.174 --> 00:47:39.393
playing match-maker, man.

877
00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:40.742
No, no!Good!

878
00:47:40.829 --> 00:47:44.006
Us?

879
00:47:44.093 --> 00:47:45.094
Yeah, good because you know
that we don't like each other.


880
00:47:45.181 --> 00:47:46.879
Right, right.

881
00:47:46.966 --> 00:47:49.490
Okay.

882
00:47:49.577 --> 00:47:51.666
Though, I was wondering
why you wouldn't let


883
00:47:51.753 --> 00:47:53.363
her see your drawings.

884
00:47:53.450 --> 00:47:55.539
Your trade
secret drawings.


885
00:47:55.626 --> 00:47:57.237
You like
this girl.


886
00:47:57.324 --> 00:47:58.238
No, no I don't.

887
00:47:58.325 --> 00:48:00.066
Yeah, yeah you do.

888
00:48:00.153 --> 00:48:02.155
No I don't.Yes you do.

889
00:48:02.242 --> 00:48:04.113
I don't.Yes you do.

890
00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:05.898
You do!

891
00:48:05.985 --> 00:48:07.769
Even if I did he
doesn't like me.


892
00:48:07.856 --> 00:48:10.903
In my opinion
-Shut up.

893
00:48:10.990 --> 00:48:12.121
Shut up.

894
00:48:12.208 --> 00:48:13.427
No I don't.

895
00:48:13.514 --> 00:48:14.515
Mmm-hmm, are you
sure about that?


896
00:48:14.602 --> 00:48:16.822
Wait, why?

897
00:48:16.909 --> 00:48:17.648
Did he say
something?


898
00:48:17.736 --> 00:48:20.564
Ah-ha! You do like him.

899
00:48:20.651 --> 00:48:21.827
You like him.

900
00:48:21.914 --> 00:48:23.698
You like him.

901
00:48:48.375 --> 00:48:50.333
Morning.

902
00:48:50.420 --> 00:48:51.944
Oh sorry, I didn't
mean to wake you.


903
00:48:52.031 --> 00:48:54.947
I just
-No, I should be up anyway.

904
00:48:55.034 --> 00:48:56.339
Coffee?

905
00:48:56.426 --> 00:48:57.558
I suppose coffee
is safe.


906
00:48:57.645 --> 00:48:59.647
You mean
among enemies?


907
00:48:59.734 --> 00:49:01.214
Exactly.

908
00:49:01.301 --> 00:49:03.172
I think it's
pretty safe.


909
00:49:03.259 --> 00:49:04.870
Mugs?

910
00:49:04.957 --> 00:49:07.394
Actually you
know what? No.


911
00:49:07.481 --> 00:49:08.874
If I'm gonna own this place I
should know where things are.


912
00:49:17.317 --> 00:49:18.448
So how do you
like your coffee?


913
00:49:18.535 --> 00:49:20.102
Black, please.

914
00:49:20.189 --> 00:49:21.234
Black it is.

915
00:49:24.846 --> 00:49:26.674
One cup of black coffee.

916
00:49:26.761 --> 00:49:29.503
Thanks.Mmm-hmm.

917
00:49:32.419 --> 00:49:35.944
So, what do you miss most
about being stuck here?


918
00:49:36.031 --> 00:49:37.641
Uh you mean
right now?Yeah.


919
00:49:40.906 --> 00:49:43.212
You're gonna
think it's silly.


920
00:49:43.299 --> 00:49:46.128
But there's this angel tree
topper and each Christmas


921
00:49:46.215 --> 00:49:49.392
we take turns on whose gonna
put it on top of the tree.


922
00:49:49.479 --> 00:49:52.004
And this year it
was your turn?


923
00:49:52.091 --> 00:49:53.527
I told you
it was silly.


924
00:49:53.614 --> 00:49:56.530
No, it's not.

925
00:49:56.617 --> 00:49:59.098
It's actually
really sweet.


926
00:49:59.185 --> 00:50:00.664
So what about you?

927
00:50:00.751 --> 00:50:02.971
What do you miss most?

928
00:50:03.058 --> 00:50:06.496
Well if it wasn't
for all of this,


929
00:50:06.583 --> 00:50:07.802
it'd actually
be pretty perfect.


930
00:50:12.328 --> 00:50:15.810
Do you want
breakfast?


931
00:50:15.897 --> 00:50:17.986
I thought it would
be good to install a skylight


932
00:50:18.073 --> 00:50:21.250
in my parents' roof to
watch the sun rise.


933
00:50:21.337 --> 00:50:24.775
I hid it forever until one day
my mother came home from work.


934
00:50:24.863 --> 00:50:27.691
She opens the car door the
second I prop open the skylight.


935
00:50:27.778 --> 00:50:30.172
Seriously? Yeah.

936
00:50:30.259 --> 00:50:31.652
Who knows how long I could've
had that thing in the house


937
00:50:31.739 --> 00:50:33.132
without anybody knowing.

938
00:50:33.219 --> 00:50:34.742
How old were you?14.

939
00:50:34.829 --> 00:50:36.831
Wow, and what'd you dad say?

940
00:50:36.918 --> 00:50:40.008
He said, "Son, you did
everything right."


941
00:50:40.095 --> 00:50:42.706
The hinges, the flashing.

942
00:50:42.793 --> 00:50:44.447
I think he was a
little proud of me.


943
00:50:44.534 --> 00:50:45.187
So did he let
you keep it?


944
00:50:45.274 --> 00:50:47.798
Uh, sort of.

945
00:50:47.886 --> 00:50:51.150
As punishment he claimed it
as his den and I moved into


946
00:50:51.237 --> 00:50:52.238
whatever was his study.

947
00:50:57.330 --> 00:50:58.679
I like your laugh.

948
00:51:04.728 --> 00:51:07.253
Oh, sorry.

949
00:51:07.340 --> 00:51:09.255
Hello?

950
00:51:09.342 --> 00:51:11.213
This is Mark.

951
00:51:11.300 --> 00:51:13.215
I see.

952
00:51:13.302 --> 00:51:15.087
Okay.

953
00:51:19.091 --> 00:51:20.788
Thanks for checking.

954
00:51:20.875 --> 00:51:22.964
Okay, bye.

955
00:51:25.445 --> 00:51:28.361
That was my lawyer.

956
00:51:28.448 --> 00:51:31.103
I checked to see whether my dad
could sit in for me when I was


957
00:51:31.190 --> 00:51:34.933
out of town, since I was
buying the house for him.


958
00:51:35.020 --> 00:51:37.848
But he said since it's my
name on the offer, he can't.


959
00:51:43.593 --> 00:51:46.857
Maybe not everybody knows this
but I have to get on a plane


960
00:51:46.945 --> 00:51:49.556
Christmas morning, which means
I need to leave tomorrow...


961
00:51:49.643 --> 00:51:52.689
after dinner.

962
00:51:52.776 --> 00:51:57.781
So whether it's now or tomorrow
I'll need to forfeit my claim.


963
00:52:02.177 --> 00:52:04.788
Dad, Trev -- I think we should
leave now and leave the Colts


964
00:52:04.875 --> 00:52:06.486
to enjoy the holidays in peace.

965
00:52:23.372 --> 00:52:24.591
Guys, let's pack.

966
00:52:24.678 --> 00:52:25.635
C'mon.

967
00:52:28.029 --> 00:52:30.684
I'm sorry.

968
00:52:30.771 --> 00:52:36.864
I don't mean to be that guy,
but if we get home tonight


969
00:52:36.951 --> 00:52:38.213
we still might be able to
get some turkey or something.


970
00:52:38.300 --> 00:52:40.433
Mr. Henderson...

971
00:52:40.520 --> 00:52:41.434
I think you and your
family should stay.


972
00:52:46.439 --> 00:52:48.136
She's right.

973
00:52:48.223 --> 00:52:50.312
You should stay.

974
00:52:50.399 --> 00:52:52.575
I mean, we're in
this together right?


975
00:52:52.662 --> 00:52:53.663
Yeah.

976
00:52:58.059 --> 00:52:59.756
I have to leave right
after dinner tomorrow.


977
00:52:59.843 --> 00:53:03.108
It's okay.

978
00:53:03.195 --> 00:53:05.327
You guys can stay
for Christmas.


979
00:53:05.414 --> 00:53:07.590
The more the merrier!

980
00:53:07.677 --> 00:53:11.594
We have a tree and turkey,
and... new friends


981
00:53:11.681 --> 00:53:12.726
to share them with.

982
00:53:22.388 --> 00:53:23.737
Okay, I guess.

983
00:53:24.955 --> 00:53:26.827
Thank you, wow.

984
00:53:26.914 --> 00:53:28.481
Was that so difficult?

985
00:53:28.568 --> 00:53:31.353
Dad, are you sure?

986
00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:32.224
I don't want you to feel like
I'm leaving you here with,


987
00:53:32.311 --> 00:53:34.313
you know, strangers.

988
00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:37.011
These people
aren't strangers.


989
00:53:37.098 --> 00:53:38.882
They're almost like
family now.


990
00:53:38.969 --> 00:53:40.754
And you know what?

991
00:53:40.841 --> 00:53:41.363
You kept
your promise.


992
00:53:41.450 --> 00:53:43.409
No, I didn't.

993
00:53:43.496 --> 00:53:45.628
But one day I'm gonna
make sure of it.


994
00:53:45.715 --> 00:53:47.587
Son, look around.

995
00:53:50.459 --> 00:53:52.722
You did better than
make good on it.


996
00:54:00.469 --> 00:54:03.168
So you're writing
more than you used to?


997
00:54:03.255 --> 00:54:05.779
Wow.

998
00:54:05.866 --> 00:54:10.131
How does that like,
affect your workload?


999
00:54:10.218 --> 00:54:12.438
Well basically I just write
more than I used to.


1000
00:54:12.525 --> 00:54:13.526
And I help Jeremy.

1001
00:54:13.613 --> 00:54:17.051
Mmm.

1002
00:54:17.138 --> 00:54:20.228
You know, it occurs to me in all
the years that I've worked for


1003
00:54:20.315 --> 00:54:23.840
Sweet Home Magazine, you've
not once asked about my job.


1004
00:54:23.927 --> 00:54:26.713
So, why the
sudden interest?


1005
00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:28.802
Can't a sister just
show interest?


1006
00:54:28.889 --> 00:54:30.151
Yeah, a sister can.

1007
00:54:30.238 --> 00:54:32.327
Not sure you can.

1008
00:54:32.414 --> 00:54:34.764
Hey, that is entirely
uncalled for and mean.


1009
00:54:34.851 --> 00:54:36.157
And also true.

1010
00:54:36.244 --> 00:54:39.769
But... wait...

1011
00:54:39.856 --> 00:54:41.771
can you just explain to me one
more time what the difference


1012
00:54:41.858 --> 00:54:44.600
is between a Junior Editor
and a regular Editor?


1013
00:54:44.687 --> 00:54:47.212
Because you know,
I'm really interested.


1014
00:54:47.299 --> 00:54:49.866
Well a Junior Editor does
less actual story editing


1015
00:54:49.953 --> 00:54:52.608
and a regular Editor
improves the structure and


1016
00:54:52.695 --> 00:54:54.349
the flow of an article.

1017
00:54:54.436 --> 00:54:56.917
You know?Oh wait, so for instance...

1018
00:54:57.004 --> 00:55:00.921
what do you mean by
structure and flow?


1019
00:55:01.008 --> 00:55:03.793
Okay Jas, there's like zero
chance you actually care about


1020
00:55:03.880 --> 00:55:06.187
this so... what's going on?

1021
00:55:06.274 --> 00:55:07.971
Nothing.

1022
00:55:08.058 --> 00:55:10.017
Wait, wait, wait, wait...

1023
00:55:10.104 --> 00:55:10.365
you can't go out there.

1024
00:55:10.452 --> 00:55:11.975
Why?

1025
00:55:12.062 --> 00:55:12.628
What's going on
out there?


1026
00:55:16.066 --> 00:55:18.068
Yes, make sure you just fill
it in and stick it together.


1027
00:55:18.156 --> 00:55:20.984
Okay.

1028
00:55:21.071 --> 00:55:23.465
How long do you think Jasmine
can keep Ariel in the bedroom?


1029
00:55:23.552 --> 00:55:24.423
Not very long, you better
get to crackin'.


1030
00:55:26.468 --> 00:55:28.166
Do you think she's
gonna like it?


1031
00:55:28.253 --> 00:55:30.255
I've never designed anything
with dough before.


1032
00:55:30.342 --> 00:55:32.648
Listen, she's
gonna love this.


1033
00:55:32.735 --> 00:55:34.737
This is so up her
alley; it's perfect.


1034
00:55:39.220 --> 00:55:41.614
Thank you for letting
us stay here.


1035
00:55:41.701 --> 00:55:43.746
Yeah.

1036
00:55:43.833 --> 00:55:46.619
Please.

1037
00:55:46.706 --> 00:55:49.099
We wouldn't have
it any other way.


1038
00:55:49.187 --> 00:55:53.278
And it's possible that I've
not seen Ariel this happy


1039
00:55:53.365 --> 00:55:56.846
at Christmas since she
was a little girl.


1040
00:55:56.933 --> 00:55:59.458
Hey...

1041
00:55:59.545 --> 00:56:01.329
How about I take this to
my room and let it set up?


1042
00:56:01.416 --> 00:56:03.984
Yes, please,
that'll be great.


1043
00:56:04.071 --> 00:56:05.855
I think it needs a bit
more work.


1044
00:56:05.942 --> 00:56:07.553
You have a little
bit more to go.


1045
00:56:21.001 --> 00:56:23.221
You look very comfortable
doing that.


1046
00:56:23.308 --> 00:56:26.093
Well, I love
to cook and bake.


1047
00:56:26.180 --> 00:56:27.181
Well you can tell.

1048
00:56:30.750 --> 00:56:32.317
My wife Sally was
a great cook.


1049
00:56:32.404 --> 00:56:34.362
Yeah?

1050
00:56:34.449 --> 00:56:35.972
What was her favorite
Christmas recipe?


1051
00:56:36.059 --> 00:56:38.323
Oh...

1052
00:56:38.410 --> 00:56:40.847
She used to make this
sweet potato mash with


1053
00:56:40.934 --> 00:56:41.891
pecans and raisins.

1054
00:56:41.978 --> 00:56:45.199
M'm, that sounds good.

1055
00:56:45.286 --> 00:56:46.940
Oh, always
a favorite.


1056
00:56:47.027 --> 00:56:48.463
The boys ate it
like dessert.


1057
00:56:48.550 --> 00:56:52.511
They'll miss it.

1058
00:56:52.598 --> 00:56:55.470
Were the pecans
candied?


1059
00:56:55.557 --> 00:56:57.429
I don't know, they were
sweet and crunchy, so maybe.


1060
00:56:57.516 --> 00:57:00.127
Yeah, sounds
like it.


1061
00:57:00.214 --> 00:57:03.304
She had this
secret ingredient.


1062
00:57:03.391 --> 00:57:06.220
She didn't tell us, I've
tried everything but...


1063
00:57:06.307 --> 00:57:07.917
it's not it.

1064
00:57:08.004 --> 00:57:11.486
Well, what did it
taste like?


1065
00:57:11.573 --> 00:57:13.967
Hard to describe.

1066
00:57:14.054 --> 00:57:18.537
Fresh like
the morning sun.


1067
00:57:18.624 --> 00:57:19.712
So what else
goes in there?


1068
00:57:19.799 --> 00:57:21.670
Oh that's it for now.

1069
00:57:21.757 --> 00:57:23.063
It'll sautee and then
we'll add the consumee,


1070
00:57:23.150 --> 00:57:25.979
the sage and some cornbread.

1071
00:57:26.066 --> 00:57:29.983
So fancy.Mmm-hmm.

1072
00:57:30.070 --> 00:57:33.116
So why didn't Mark
follow in your footsteps?


1073
00:57:33.203 --> 00:57:35.597
He did at first.

1074
00:57:35.684 --> 00:57:38.644
But he's smart.

1075
00:57:38.731 --> 00:57:40.341
Smarter than a lot of the
architects we worked with.


1076
00:57:40.428 --> 00:57:42.082
So now we work
on his designs.


1077
00:57:42.169 --> 00:57:44.954
Well that's nice.

1078
00:57:45.041 --> 00:57:48.175
And he pushed Trevor
to go to college too.


1079
00:57:48.262 --> 00:57:52.962
At first Trevor didn't want to,
but Mark didn't give up.


1080
00:57:53.049 --> 00:57:56.183
Hey Mr. Henderson?Hmm?

1081
00:57:56.270 --> 00:57:58.011
Do you know why Mark wanted
to buy you this cottage?


1082
00:58:01.319 --> 00:58:04.496
Before she died he made
a promise to his mother.


1083
00:58:04.583 --> 00:58:07.760
We used to have a cottage.

1084
00:58:07.847 --> 00:58:10.589
We'd spend the holidays
there every Christmas.


1085
00:58:10.676 --> 00:58:14.419
And when Sally got sick...

1086
00:58:14.506 --> 00:58:17.944
We had to sell it to
pay for her treatments.


1087
00:58:18.031 --> 00:58:21.600
A few weeks before she died

1088
00:58:21.687 --> 00:58:23.732
she made the boys promise
to find me a cottage


1089
00:58:23.819 --> 00:58:24.907
again for Christmas.

1090
00:59:02.249 --> 00:59:03.903
All good over here.

1091
00:59:03.990 --> 00:59:05.426
Go, go...

1092
00:59:05.513 --> 00:59:06.732
Are you ready?

1093
00:59:06.819 --> 00:59:07.210
Ready.

1094
00:59:07.297 --> 00:59:09.517
Ready.

1095
00:59:16.959 --> 00:59:17.960
No?

1096
00:59:18.047 --> 00:59:19.048
Mmm, no.

1097
00:59:19.135 --> 00:59:20.093
Okay.

1098
00:59:29.145 --> 00:59:30.059
No.

1099
00:59:30.146 --> 00:59:32.888
Okay, got it.

1100
00:59:32.975 --> 00:59:34.063
One last shot.

1101
00:59:43.377 --> 00:59:44.204
That's it!

1102
00:59:46.859 --> 00:59:47.990
Unbelievable.

1103
00:59:48.077 --> 00:59:49.209
Oh my gosh.

1104
00:59:49.296 --> 00:59:50.558
Good!

1105
00:59:50.645 --> 00:59:53.909
Sally's smiling down.

1106
00:59:53.996 --> 00:59:56.608
Oh boy.

1107
00:59:56.695 --> 00:59:57.783
Incredible.

1108
01:00:25.332 --> 01:00:27.595
I think you
should go outside.


1109
01:00:41.479 --> 01:00:42.262
Go away.

1110
01:00:46.396 --> 01:00:47.833
Hey.

1111
01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:49.051
How's your
story coming?


1112
01:00:49.138 --> 01:00:51.140
Great, actually.

1113
01:00:51.227 --> 01:00:52.098
Can I help?

1114
01:00:52.185 --> 01:00:54.753
No, no I've got this.

1115
01:00:54.840 --> 01:00:56.581
So I hear I should
get a skylight.


1116
01:00:56.668 --> 01:00:57.886
Yeah.

1117
01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:02.064
Hey, when you
all leave-


1118
01:01:02.151 --> 01:01:03.805
How come you're
doing this?


1119
01:01:03.892 --> 01:01:06.112
So you don't fall
off the porch.


1120
01:01:06.199 --> 01:01:07.896
Plus you were
nice to us.


1121
01:01:07.983 --> 01:01:10.638
Twice now.

1122
01:01:10.725 --> 01:01:13.772
And I figured you
deserved some nice back.


1123
01:01:13.859 --> 01:01:14.903
Well, thank you.

1124
01:01:14.990 --> 01:01:17.384
And it's Christmas.

1125
01:01:17.471 --> 01:01:18.167
I knew you'd notice.

1126
01:01:42.191 --> 01:01:45.107
You want to look
for more decorations?


1127
01:01:45.194 --> 01:01:45.673
Yeah, let me put
on something warmer.


1128
01:01:47.632 --> 01:01:50.548
Thank you.

1129
01:01:50.635 --> 01:01:52.114
I didn't want you to miss
Christmas, even though


1130
01:01:52.201 --> 01:01:53.986
I know you don't like it.

1131
01:01:54.073 --> 01:01:56.728
Well...

1132
01:01:56.815 --> 01:01:58.860
it's good for my family
to be around happy people.


1133
01:01:58.947 --> 01:02:01.471
They need that,
especially my dad.


1134
01:02:01.559 --> 01:02:03.212
What about you?

1135
01:02:03.299 --> 01:02:05.780
What do you need?

1136
01:02:05.867 --> 01:02:08.522
I don't know.

1137
01:02:08.609 --> 01:02:12.178
What I need you can't
buy in a store.


1138
01:02:12.265 --> 01:02:14.702
Mark, I know you
miss your mom.


1139
01:02:14.789 --> 01:02:19.794
I'm so, so sorry about
what happened to her.


1140
01:02:19.881 --> 01:02:20.534
But I'm certain that
she wouldn't want


1141
01:02:20.621 --> 01:02:23.755
you to hate Christmas.

1142
01:02:23.842 --> 01:02:27.541
Christmas is a time for hope,
forgiveness, peace on earth,


1143
01:02:27.628 --> 01:02:32.546
good will to men.

1144
01:02:32.633 --> 01:02:36.071
Look, nothing's ever gonna
replace her, not ever.


1145
01:02:37.812 --> 01:02:42.687
She was awesome.

1146
01:02:42.774 --> 01:02:46.560
My first memories of
Christmas was waking up to


1147
01:02:46.647 --> 01:02:48.562
the smells of her cooking.

1148
01:02:48.649 --> 01:02:51.217
Her baking.

1149
01:02:51.304 --> 01:02:54.699
She used to bake a
month before Christmas.


1150
01:02:54.786 --> 01:02:58.659
The entire neighborhood would
smell like her cookies.


1151
01:02:58.746 --> 01:03:02.794
Look, right now because of
our fathers and your brother


1152
01:03:02.881 --> 01:03:06.232
the place smells like
a Christmas tree.


1153
01:03:06.319 --> 01:03:11.629
And tomorrow, it'll smell like
turkey, fried okra,


1154
01:03:11.716 --> 01:03:17.199
cornbread dressing, yeast rolls,
'cranberry sauce,


1155
01:03:17.286 --> 01:03:26.078
green bean casserole and
homemade pecan pie.


1156
01:03:26.165 --> 01:03:31.518
And that... that is your dad's
homemade mountain apple cider


1157
01:03:31.605 --> 01:03:32.693
that he's been simmering
all day long.


1158
01:03:35.304 --> 01:03:37.567
He loves you so much.

1159
01:03:37.655 --> 01:03:38.873
We're all here for you.

1160
01:03:51.364 --> 01:03:54.323
And that's how...

1161
01:04:02.505 --> 01:04:06.161
Done and... sent.

1162
01:04:43.546 --> 01:04:45.113
Huh, still
needs something.


1163
01:04:48.595 --> 01:04:51.076
I know, there are no more
pinecones, I checked.


1164
01:04:51.163 --> 01:04:53.426
I didn't know
you were up.


1165
01:04:53.513 --> 01:04:54.514
It's almost Christmas I want
to enjoy every second of it.


1166
01:04:58.648 --> 01:05:01.173
Alright,
what else can we use?


1167
01:05:01.260 --> 01:05:03.479
I don't know, foam, wood?

1168
01:05:03.566 --> 01:05:05.133
We have wood.

1169
01:05:05.220 --> 01:05:06.047
But we don't have
any art supplies.


1170
01:05:06.134 --> 01:05:08.397
Yeah.

1171
01:05:08.484 --> 01:05:10.138
Have you been up
in the attic?


1172
01:05:10.225 --> 01:05:12.184
We have an attic?

1173
01:05:15.274 --> 01:05:18.059
Wow, I wonder how long
all this has been here.


1174
01:05:18.146 --> 01:05:21.193
Decades maybe.

1175
01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:22.237
So what are we
hoping to find?


1176
01:05:22.324 --> 01:05:24.326
Anything.

1177
01:05:24.413 --> 01:05:25.937
Nice.

1178
01:05:26.024 --> 01:05:27.982
Paint.

1179
01:05:28.069 --> 01:05:30.289
Whatcha doing?

1180
01:05:30.376 --> 01:05:32.247
Looking for things
to make ornaments with.


1181
01:05:32.334 --> 01:05:36.904
Whoa.
Cool.


1182
01:05:36.991 --> 01:05:39.211
I know, the problem
is what do we paint?


1183
01:05:39.298 --> 01:05:41.474
What if you made
some wooden balls?


1184
01:05:41.561 --> 01:05:42.736
We don't have a lathe.

1185
01:05:42.823 --> 01:05:45.043
We could build one.

1186
01:05:45.130 --> 01:05:47.001
Yeah, there's a ton
of wood on the porch.


1187
01:05:47.088 --> 01:05:49.308
All we need are bolts,
a drill, a saw, and a router.


1188
01:05:49.395 --> 01:05:50.439
All that stuff's in dad's van.

1189
01:05:50.526 --> 01:05:51.527
Okay!

1190
01:05:51.614 --> 01:05:53.312
Great.

1191
01:05:53.399 --> 01:05:55.357
I'll take that, thank you.

1192
01:05:55.444 --> 01:05:58.621
C'mon bro, let's get fancy.

1193
01:05:58.708 --> 01:05:59.840
Do you want to help
me find things to


1194
01:05:59.927 --> 01:06:00.623
decorate the balls with? 
Jasmine: Yeah.

1195
01:06:09.502 --> 01:06:11.417
So...

1196
01:06:11.504 --> 01:06:12.548
How's it going
with Mark?


1197
01:06:12.635 --> 01:06:14.855
It's fine.

1198
01:06:14.942 --> 01:06:15.856
I mean, he leaves tonight
so I probably will


1199
01:06:15.943 --> 01:06:17.466
never see him again.

1200
01:06:17.553 --> 01:06:19.512
What time's your flight?

1201
01:06:19.599 --> 01:06:21.688
Eleven A.M.

1202
01:06:21.775 --> 01:06:23.255
Are you gonna talk to
Ariel before you leave?


1203
01:06:23.342 --> 01:06:24.299
About what?

1204
01:06:24.386 --> 01:06:26.780
How you feel.

1205
01:06:26.867 --> 01:06:31.176
For what it's worth, Trevor
is sure that Mark likes you.


1206
01:06:31.263 --> 01:06:33.961
Man, I mean what's
the point?


1207
01:06:34.048 --> 01:06:38.357
You know, I go to Australia
for two years, maybe longer.


1208
01:06:38.444 --> 01:06:40.359
You and him talk
about this?


1209
01:06:40.446 --> 01:06:42.056
Actually yes,
quite a bit.


1210
01:06:42.143 --> 01:06:44.058
Great.

1211
01:06:44.145 --> 01:06:44.406
I think you're
making a mistake.


1212
01:06:44.493 --> 01:06:46.060
How?

1213
01:06:46.147 --> 01:06:48.062
Do you like him?

1214
01:06:48.149 --> 01:06:49.934
Mmm-hmm.

1215
01:06:50.021 --> 01:06:50.804
She likes you,
you know.


1216
01:06:56.984 --> 01:06:58.768
You think so?

1217
01:06:58.856 --> 01:06:59.857
Yeah.

1218
01:07:17.787 --> 01:07:21.313
Okay...

1219
01:07:24.446 --> 01:07:28.189
Wow, I'm impressed.

1220
01:08:08.969 --> 01:08:09.665
Oh, one more thing.

1221
01:08:13.626 --> 01:08:16.977
Where did you find this?

1222
01:08:17.064 --> 01:08:19.110
I know it's probably not
gonna be the same but...


1223
01:08:19.197 --> 01:08:20.415
I didn't want you
to miss your turn.


1224
01:08:25.464 --> 01:08:27.857
It's beautiful.

1225
01:08:27.945 --> 01:08:31.687
Thank you.

1226
01:08:31.774 --> 01:08:34.864
So I was thinking I'd make
a fire before dinner.


1227
01:08:34.952 --> 01:08:37.345
I'd like that.

1228
01:08:37.432 --> 01:08:38.825
I want to give you your
Christmas present before


1229
01:08:38.912 --> 01:08:40.870
you know, I leave.

1230
01:08:40.958 --> 01:08:43.134
Yeah, me too.

1231
01:08:43.221 --> 01:08:45.658
I figured we were each
others' secret Santa.


1232
01:08:45.745 --> 01:08:47.007
Not entirely by
accident I'm sure.


1233
01:08:48.704 --> 01:08:50.358
Okay, I'm gonna
get yours ready.


1234
01:08:50.445 --> 01:08:51.055
Meet you outside?Yeah.

1235
01:08:51.142 --> 01:08:52.882
Okay.

1236
01:09:16.123 --> 01:09:17.516
Here we go.

1237
01:09:30.703 --> 01:09:32.357
Maybe this is a dumb idea.

1238
01:09:32.444 --> 01:09:34.576
Don't you dare.

1239
01:09:34.663 --> 01:09:35.316
Is that my present?

1240
01:09:40.495 --> 01:09:42.149
Wow, this looks amazing.

1241
01:09:50.201 --> 01:09:52.768
Well, I love the box and
if there's anything inside


1242
01:09:52.855 --> 01:09:56.207
it's just a bonus.

1243
01:09:56.294 --> 01:09:57.164
Okay...

1244
01:10:01.255 --> 01:10:03.214
Merry Christmas, Ariel.

1245
01:10:09.785 --> 01:10:11.831
It looks just like
the real one.


1246
01:10:11.918 --> 01:10:14.703
This is amazing.

1247
01:10:14.790 --> 01:10:18.229
It has a skylight.

1248
01:10:18.316 --> 01:10:20.535
For the morning sun.

1249
01:10:20.622 --> 01:10:22.015
I love it, thank you.

1250
01:10:22.102 --> 01:10:26.150
You do?

1251
01:10:26.237 --> 01:10:28.761
Of course I do.

1252
01:10:28.848 --> 01:10:31.764
I wonder how
long it'll last.


1253
01:10:31.851 --> 01:10:33.200
What you're not
gonna eat it?


1254
01:10:33.287 --> 01:10:38.510
No, I want to keep it.

1255
01:10:38.597 --> 01:10:39.815
At least until tomorrow morning,
and then I'm totally eating it.


1256
01:10:41.643 --> 01:10:43.080
Okay, your turn.

1257
01:10:43.167 --> 01:10:46.300
You ready?Yeah.

1258
01:10:46.387 --> 01:10:47.867
Merry Christmas.

1259
01:10:47.954 --> 01:10:50.174
I hope you like it.

1260
01:10:50.261 --> 01:10:51.262
I have one more present
for you but this is just


1261
01:10:51.349 --> 01:10:53.525
your first present.

1262
01:10:53.612 --> 01:10:55.396
Tomorrow before you leave,
I have another one.


1263
01:10:55.483 --> 01:10:57.137
What do you mean? Why?

1264
01:10:57.224 --> 01:10:58.269
You ask too
many questions.


1265
01:10:58.356 --> 01:10:58.617
Just open your
first present.


1266
01:10:58.704 --> 01:11:00.053
Oh.

1267
01:11:06.277 --> 01:11:07.582
Is it right?

1268
01:11:14.241 --> 01:11:17.288
Yes.

1269
01:11:17.375 --> 01:11:19.116
This is exactly how
my mom used to make it.


1270
01:11:24.904 --> 01:11:28.603
Uh, how did you- we couldn't
even figure out the ingredients.


1271
01:11:28.690 --> 01:11:32.259
Orange juice
and ginger.


1272
01:11:34.870 --> 01:11:38.091
Thank you.

1273
01:11:38.178 --> 01:11:40.963
You have no idea how
much this means to me.


1274
01:11:41.050 --> 01:11:42.878
All of us.

1275
01:11:42.965 --> 01:11:44.750
You're welcome.

1276
01:11:44.837 --> 01:11:46.360
Your dad and
Trevor helped.


1277
01:11:46.447 --> 01:11:47.274
They were my
tasters.


1278
01:11:53.237 --> 01:11:56.370
I really wish I
didn't have to leave.


1279
01:11:56.457 --> 01:11:59.504
Yeah, I've been wishing
that for a while now.


1280
01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:09.035
Hey
guys, dinner's-


1281
01:12:09.122 --> 01:12:10.950
Oh, oh...

1282
01:12:17.304 --> 01:12:20.612
Dinner's ready
when you are.


1283
01:12:20.699 --> 01:12:21.265
Okay.Be right there.

1284
01:12:23.963 --> 01:12:26.095
Knuckleheads.

1285
01:12:26.183 --> 01:12:27.314
So annoying
sometimes.


1286
01:12:39.805 --> 01:12:43.112
This article
better be ready.


1287
01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:44.984
Arrival in one hour.

1288
01:12:54.733 --> 01:12:57.605
Dear God,
thank You for this bounty
and Your provision.


1289
01:12:57.692 --> 01:13:00.217
Thank You for new friends
and thank You for Christmas.


1290
01:13:00.304 --> 01:13:02.871
And what it means to us all.

1291
01:13:02.958 --> 01:13:06.353
In Jesus' name, amen. ALL: Amen.

1292
01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:08.050
Let's bring in the food.

1293
01:13:08.137 --> 01:13:09.791
She makes a mean turkey.

1294
01:13:09.878 --> 01:13:12.098
See?

1295
01:13:12.185 --> 01:13:13.012
It looks very nice if
I do say so myself.


1296
01:13:15.580 --> 01:13:16.798
Enjoy, everyone.

1297
01:13:18.278 --> 01:13:20.976
Don't take too much.

1298
01:13:21.063 --> 01:13:22.326
This means
a lot to us.


1299
01:13:22.413 --> 01:13:23.152
Thank you, really.

1300
01:13:27.200 --> 01:13:28.854
M'm.

1301
01:13:28.941 --> 01:13:30.464
Amazing.

1302
01:13:30.551 --> 01:13:31.552
Just like
your mother's?


1303
01:13:31.639 --> 01:13:33.293
Just like mom's.

1304
01:13:33.380 --> 01:13:35.121
Incredible.

1305
01:13:35.208 --> 01:13:36.949
Thank you, again.

1306
01:13:37.036 --> 01:13:38.298
Well it was all
three of us.


1307
01:13:44.173 --> 01:13:46.393
I'll get it.

1308
01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:48.830
Coming.

1309
01:13:49.875 --> 01:13:51.050
Please, come in.

1310
01:13:51.137 --> 01:13:51.529
It's cold out there.

1311
01:13:51.616 --> 01:13:52.573
Amazing.

1312
01:13:57.099 --> 01:13:58.362
What can I
do for you?


1313
01:13:58.449 --> 01:14:00.494
Hi.

1314
01:14:00.581 --> 01:14:01.887
I'm Jeremy Huckabee...

1315
01:14:01.974 --> 01:14:02.801
Ariel Colt's boss.

1316
01:14:02.888 --> 01:14:03.932
Oh...

1317
01:14:07.196 --> 01:14:09.198
Is she here?She is, yeah.

1318
01:14:09.286 --> 01:14:09.764
Let me go and
get her for you.


1319
01:14:09.851 --> 01:14:12.332
I'm Mark, by the way.

1320
01:14:12.419 --> 01:14:15.335
Ah, Mark... the subject of
Ariel's Christmas article


1321
01:14:15.422 --> 01:14:18.033
which she forgot to
send me by the way.


1322
01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:20.732
That's funny you uh, you don't
look like you hate Christmas.


1323
01:14:20.819 --> 01:14:22.995
Excuse me?

1324
01:14:23.082 --> 01:14:26.390
Bring On The Grinch.

1325
01:14:26.477 --> 01:14:29.175
You are the Mark who she wrote
the article about aren't you?


1326
01:14:29.262 --> 01:14:32.787
The guy who
hates Christmas.


1327
01:14:32.874 --> 01:14:36.356
Is that what you've been
doing this whole time?


1328
01:14:36.443 --> 01:14:37.879
All I've shared with you,
you've just been asking me


1329
01:14:37.966 --> 01:14:39.098
questions for your article?

1330
01:14:39.185 --> 01:14:40.404
No, it's not like that.

1331
01:14:40.491 --> 01:14:40.969
I just, I needed
to write-


1332
01:14:41.056 --> 01:14:42.144
Excuse me.

1333
01:14:42.231 --> 01:14:45.844
Mark!

1334
01:14:45.931 --> 01:14:47.889
Ariel, this article needs
to be uploaded by tonight.


1335
01:14:47.976 --> 01:14:50.239
So I need this now.

1336
01:14:50.327 --> 01:14:53.504
Yeah, can you
take care of this?


1337
01:14:53.591 --> 01:14:54.722
I sent it already.

1338
01:14:54.809 --> 01:14:56.028
I'm sorry.

1339
01:14:56.115 --> 01:14:58.335
I have to go.

1340
01:14:58.422 --> 01:15:00.989
Can I offer
you some pie?


1341
01:15:01.076 --> 01:15:02.861
Coffee?

1342
01:15:02.948 --> 01:15:04.863
Turkey?

1343
01:15:04.950 --> 01:15:06.081
Here you go.

1344
01:15:06.168 --> 01:15:07.344
We have plenty.

1345
01:15:07.431 --> 01:15:08.345
No, thank you.

1346
01:15:12.261 --> 01:15:13.175
Merry Christmas.

1347
01:15:15.003 --> 01:15:17.136
You guys, I-

1348
01:15:17.223 --> 01:15:17.484
I really think you
should read this.


1349
01:15:24.273 --> 01:15:25.405
Will you talk
to me, please?


1350
01:15:25.492 --> 01:15:26.885
I have nothing to say.

1351
01:15:26.972 --> 01:15:28.887
Mark, that article
wasn't my idea.


1352
01:15:28.974 --> 01:15:31.672
I didn't even want
to write it.


1353
01:15:31.759 --> 01:15:32.934
But you did.

1354
01:15:33.021 --> 01:15:34.022
I'm sorry.

1355
01:15:38.375 --> 01:15:43.075
Do you have any idea how hard it
was for me to talk about her?


1356
01:15:43.162 --> 01:15:45.991
You probably took my words,
twisted them around and made


1357
01:15:46.078 --> 01:15:46.731
me sound like a
terrible person.


1358
01:15:46.818 --> 01:15:48.994
Mark...

1359
01:15:49.081 --> 01:15:51.475
I hope it was worth
it, selling me out.


1360
01:15:51.562 --> 01:15:53.868
If you'd just
let me explain...


1361
01:15:53.955 --> 01:15:57.219
How am I ever supposed
to trust you again?


1362
01:15:57.306 --> 01:15:58.133
You're not the girl
I thought you were.


1363
01:16:21.418 --> 01:16:23.811
Looks like
it may snow.


1364
01:16:23.898 --> 01:16:25.857
Yeah.

1365
01:16:25.944 --> 01:16:26.814
We'll all have
a white Christmas.


1366
01:16:32.429 --> 01:16:35.170
You came here expecting to
buy a cottage and in turn


1367
01:16:35.257 --> 01:16:39.653
you fell in love.

1368
01:16:39.740 --> 01:16:41.612
I've never seen my son look
as hurt as he did tonight.


1369
01:16:47.444 --> 01:16:50.447
That kind of hurt only happens
when you love someone.


1370
01:16:50.534 --> 01:16:53.232
Ariel, he loves you.

1371
01:16:53.319 --> 01:16:56.235
It's too late;
he's right.


1372
01:16:56.322 --> 01:16:57.192
Your parents told me what
you were planning to do.


1373
01:16:57.279 --> 01:16:59.630
Why?

1374
01:17:01.849 --> 01:17:04.635
Your heart is
as big as his.


1375
01:17:04.722 --> 01:17:07.333
Try talking to him again.

1376
01:17:07.420 --> 01:17:10.989
I can't, I hurt him.

1377
01:17:11.076 --> 01:17:14.427
And there's...
there's no undoing that.


1378
01:17:14.514 --> 01:17:17.299
Go talk to him.

1379
01:17:17.386 --> 01:17:18.692
And take this with you.

1380
01:17:30.443 --> 01:17:32.924
I'm sorry, please read this and
see if I am who you think I am.


1381
01:17:47.286 --> 01:17:48.809
My Christmas In The Pines.

1382
01:17:48.896 --> 01:17:52.509
By Ariel Colt.

1383
01:17:52.596 --> 01:17:55.512
This year, like every other
year, I had made the perfect


1384
01:17:55.599 --> 01:17:57.557
itinerary because long ago
I realized that I can't


1385
01:17:57.644 --> 01:18:00.604
leave Christmas to chance.

1386
01:18:00.691 --> 01:18:01.343
When I was little we
used to spend Christmas


1387
01:18:01.430 --> 01:18:04.869
with my grandparents.

1388
01:18:04.956 --> 01:18:08.568
We played games, made
ornaments and baked cookies.


1389
01:18:08.655 --> 01:18:10.962
Those were the true
old-fashioned Christmases that


1390
01:18:11.049 --> 01:18:14.966
I tried to recreate ever since.

1391
01:18:15.053 --> 01:18:18.186
But nowadays nobody knows
the true meaning of Christmas.


1392
01:18:18.273 --> 01:18:20.928
Or so I thought.

1393
01:18:21.015 --> 01:18:22.321
I prided myself on
knowing that Christmas


1394
01:18:22.408 --> 01:18:25.106
wasn't about presents.

1395
01:18:25.193 --> 01:18:27.587
What I didn't realize is,
I forgot to cherish what was


1396
01:18:27.674 --> 01:18:30.590
right in front of me.

1397
01:18:30.677 --> 01:18:33.332
Through the strangest of
circumstances, which I must


1398
01:18:33.419 --> 01:18:36.509
tell you about in another
issue, my family and I got


1399
01:18:36.596 --> 01:18:38.337
a chance to spend this
Christmas in beautiful


1400
01:18:38.424 --> 01:18:42.646
Carolinas with another family.

1401
01:18:42.733 --> 01:18:47.346
A family who wasn't looking
forward to this holiday.


1402
01:18:47.433 --> 01:18:50.392
Because it was their first
Christmas without someone.


1403
01:18:50.479 --> 01:18:54.483
A mom, who made
every holiday special.


1404
01:18:54.571 --> 01:18:57.791
a son, who didn't know how

1405
01:18:57.878 --> 01:19:01.360
to spend Christmas without her.

1406
01:19:01.447 --> 01:19:03.492
And yet, while I was
complaining about not having


1407
01:19:03.580 --> 01:19:05.277
a perfect Christmas...Hey!

1408
01:19:05.364 --> 01:19:07.584
Oh!

1409
01:19:07.671 --> 01:19:11.109
Oh...she's so pretty.

1410
01:19:11.196 --> 01:19:11.500
...they were all focused on

1411
01:19:11.588 --> 01:19:13.677
making the best of what we had.

1412
01:19:17.594 --> 01:19:18.159
That's it!

1413
01:19:18.246 --> 01:19:22.773
Aahh!

1414
01:19:22.860 --> 01:19:25.993
While I was trying to make
everything perfect...


1415
01:19:26.080 --> 01:19:27.212
it was about being present
with the ones we love.


1416
01:19:31.956 --> 01:19:34.045
It was here that I realized
that my rigid plans are no


1417
01:19:34.132 --> 01:19:35.568
match to finding
a missing ingredient


1418
01:19:35.655 --> 01:19:37.918
to a lost Christmas recipe.

1419
01:19:38.005 --> 01:19:39.006
Is it right?

1420
01:19:43.445 --> 01:19:46.057
Or helping someone
fulfill a promise.


1421
01:19:46.144 --> 01:19:47.885
In the end it doesn't
matter what we do.


1422
01:19:47.972 --> 01:19:51.018
So long as we're together.

1423
01:19:51.105 --> 01:19:53.542
And that sometimes the most
imperfect Christmas


1424
01:19:53.630 --> 01:19:56.850
will give us the most
perfect memories.


1425
01:19:56.937 --> 01:19:59.244
If we open our hearts,
we will always have hope


1426
01:19:59.331 --> 01:20:01.899
and the blessings of Christmas.

1427
01:20:01.986 --> 01:20:05.337
Christmas is about giving.

1428
01:20:05.424 --> 01:20:08.079
But we must give what's
most precious, love.


1429
01:20:09.602 --> 01:20:12.736
Ariel!

1430
01:20:12.823 --> 01:20:13.867
This family I told you about...

1431
01:20:13.954 --> 01:20:16.435
What is
she doing?Shh! Just watch.


1432
01:20:16.522 --> 01:20:17.915
They think we saved them

1433
01:20:19.264 --> 01:20:23.964
Ariel! Ah no...

1434
01:20:24.051 --> 01:20:24.269
But, I think it's
the other way around.


1435
01:20:24.356 --> 01:20:25.705
Stop!

1436
01:20:25.792 --> 01:20:28.142
Ariel, wait!

1437
01:20:28.229 --> 01:20:31.058
Why are you
doing this?


1438
01:20:31.145 --> 01:20:31.798
All you have to do is
wait for me to leave


1439
01:20:31.885 --> 01:20:32.756
and the place is yours.

1440
01:20:32.843 --> 01:20:34.888
I know.

1441
01:20:34.975 --> 01:20:36.760
So, I don't
understand.


1442
01:20:36.847 --> 01:20:39.284
Christmas is
about giving.


1443
01:20:39.371 --> 01:20:41.286
And until this evening,
this has been the best


1444
01:20:41.373 --> 01:20:44.724
Christmas I ever had.

1445
01:20:44.811 --> 01:20:47.858
It didn't matter
about the cottage.


1446
01:20:47.945 --> 01:20:50.948
It was about all of us
here together.


1447
01:20:51.035 --> 01:20:54.516
It was about you.

1448
01:20:54.603 --> 01:20:56.693
Ariel, no.

1449
01:20:56.780 --> 01:21:00.087
I want you and your
family to have it.


1450
01:21:05.005 --> 01:21:07.878
Uh... Honey does that
look right to you?


1451
01:21:07.965 --> 01:21:11.272
Actually I moved that
when I bumped into it.


1452
01:21:11.359 --> 01:21:13.013
It's about three
inches further!


1453
01:21:15.799 --> 01:21:17.975
That's it!

1454
01:21:20.717 --> 01:21:25.156
Congratulations, you
now have a cottage.


1455
01:21:27.854 --> 01:21:29.029
I read your article.

1456
01:21:33.207 --> 01:21:38.822
You're exactly the
girl that I thought you were.


1457
01:21:47.526 --> 01:21:50.921
So, you gonna show me
around your cottage?


1458
01:21:51.008 --> 01:21:52.444
I think you'll
like it.


1459
01:21:52.531 --> 01:21:53.750
I think it needs
a skylight.


1460
01:21:56.491 --> 01:21:57.884
Let's open some presents!

1461
01:22:03.934 --> 01:22:05.196
Okay!

1462
01:22:05.283 --> 01:22:06.893
Thank you.

1463
01:22:06.980 --> 01:22:08.939
And dad.

1464
01:22:09.026 --> 01:22:11.724
Oh, thank you Mark.

1465
01:22:11.811 --> 01:22:13.334
I don't have one.

1466
01:22:13.421 --> 01:22:15.946
Well...

1467
01:22:18.122 --> 01:22:19.123
You are my
hummingbird.


1468
01:22:19.210 --> 01:22:21.212
Aww...

1469
01:22:21.299 --> 01:22:22.039
Merry Christmas.

1470
01:22:23.780 --> 01:22:25.651
Thank you, whoever you are.

1471
01:22:25.738 --> 01:22:27.435
I needed one of these, yes!

1472
01:22:29.220 --> 01:22:31.439
Oh!

1473
01:22:31.526 --> 01:22:34.529
That looks sharp.

1474
01:22:34.616 --> 01:22:41.188
Oh Duke... I am going to
enjoy making use of this.


1475
01:22:41.275 --> 01:22:43.712
What do you say we come
back up after the holidays?


1476
01:22:43.800 --> 01:22:45.714
Let's see what's in this lake.

1477
01:22:45.802 --> 01:22:46.585
Now you're speaking
my language.


1478
01:22:51.068 --> 01:22:53.505
Oh my gosh,
look at that!


1479
01:22:53.592 --> 01:22:55.028
It's a guitar strap.

1480
01:22:55.115 --> 01:22:58.902
Wow.That is amazing,
I love it.


1481
01:22:58.989 --> 01:23:01.818
Hold on, I have
something for Jasmine.


1482
01:23:01.905 --> 01:23:03.863
No...

1483
01:23:03.950 --> 01:23:04.777
For me, are
you serious?


1484
01:23:04.864 --> 01:23:07.301
Totally!

1485
01:23:07.388 --> 01:23:08.868
I don't know what to say,
thank you so much.


1486
01:23:08.955 --> 01:23:10.827
You're welcome.

1487
01:23:10.914 --> 01:23:11.436
Are you gonna
teach me more songs?


1488
01:23:11.523 --> 01:23:13.481
Absolutely, you bet.

1489
01:23:13.568 --> 01:23:16.745
But what about
your present?


1490
01:23:16.833 --> 01:23:17.224
Oh don't worry about that;
I got more of those at home.


1491
01:23:17.311 --> 01:23:19.487
So...

1492
01:23:19.574 --> 01:23:22.273
Can I get everybody's
attention please?


1493
01:23:22.360 --> 01:23:26.886
So my family and I
have been thinking...


1494
01:23:26.973 --> 01:23:27.931
that we don't want
to buy this cottage...


1495
01:23:28.018 --> 01:23:30.324
What?

1496
01:23:30.411 --> 01:23:34.285
...alone.

1497
01:23:34.372 --> 01:23:36.200
We'd like to propose that all of
us here, the two families,


1498
01:23:36.287 --> 01:23:38.550
buy it together.

1499
01:23:38.637 --> 01:23:41.422
And I would love for you
and your family to stay here


1500
01:23:41.509 --> 01:23:43.337
with mine while I'm gone.

1501
01:23:43.424 --> 01:23:44.817
Oh...

1502
01:23:44.904 --> 01:23:48.734
A few days ago I...

1503
01:23:48.821 --> 01:23:52.607
wasn't sure that I would really
ever love Christmas again.


1504
01:23:52.694 --> 01:23:55.088
And uh...

1505
01:23:55.175 --> 01:23:56.394
You helped me.

1506
01:23:56.481 --> 01:23:59.092
So thank you.

1507
01:23:59.179 --> 01:24:01.834
What my son is really
trying to say is...


1508
01:24:01.921 --> 01:24:05.751
that we should own
this property together.


1509
01:24:05.838 --> 01:24:07.796
My wife Sally wanted me
to have a cottage again.


1510
01:24:10.843 --> 01:24:12.105
But it's you I really needed.

1511
01:24:14.978 --> 01:24:16.414
You in?

1512
01:24:16.501 --> 01:24:17.763
Let's do it!Yes!

1513
01:24:17.850 --> 01:24:18.895
Yeah.

1514
01:24:18.982 --> 01:24:21.767
Yes!

1515
01:24:21.854 --> 01:24:23.987
Proud of you son.

1516
01:24:24.074 --> 01:24:25.814
The owner will be here soon
to sign the paperwork.


1517
01:24:25.902 --> 01:24:27.381
Oh.

1518
01:24:27.468 --> 01:24:28.905
Australia, excuse me.

1519
01:24:28.992 --> 01:24:30.167
Hi, Kathy?

1520
01:24:30.254 --> 01:24:31.211
Yeah...

1521
01:24:31.298 --> 01:24:34.954
Scoot over.

1522
01:24:35.041 --> 01:24:35.781
So I guess we're gonna have
to go shopping for your


1523
01:24:35.868 --> 01:24:39.132
gifts after the holidays.Nah...

1524
01:24:39.219 --> 01:24:42.614
You were right.

1525
01:24:42.701 --> 01:24:43.702
This is better than
anything I would've had


1526
01:24:43.789 --> 01:24:44.659
on my Christmas list.

1527
01:24:44.746 --> 01:24:46.313
Whoa.I mean...

1528
01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:48.968
where am I gonna wear
a purse anyways?


1529
01:24:49.055 --> 01:24:50.796
You did good, sis.Thanks.

1530
01:24:50.883 --> 01:24:52.058
You did real good.

1531
01:24:54.626 --> 01:24:55.932
Bad connection.

1532
01:24:56.019 --> 01:24:58.064
I'll call her
on the road.


1533
01:25:00.762 --> 01:25:01.807
Must be the owner.

1534
01:25:01.894 --> 01:25:02.764
Come in!

1535
01:25:12.252 --> 01:25:14.689
Merry Christmas everyone.

1536
01:25:14.776 --> 01:25:18.302
My name is Mr. Noel.

1537
01:25:18.389 --> 01:25:19.216
Nice to finally
meet you.


1538
01:25:19.303 --> 01:25:20.869
Ha, likewise.

1539
01:25:20.957 --> 01:25:22.523
Are Nick and
Erica coming?


1540
01:25:22.610 --> 01:25:24.177
No, they're with
their families.


1541
01:25:24.264 --> 01:25:25.570
I thought we could
do this ourselves.


1542
01:25:25.657 --> 01:25:29.878
I brought
the paperwork.


1543
01:25:29.966 --> 01:25:32.664
Oh, I'm sorry, excuse
me just a second.


1544
01:25:32.751 --> 01:25:33.795
Hey Kathy...

1545
01:25:33.882 --> 01:25:37.538
Santa?

1546
01:25:37.625 --> 01:25:39.627
Did you get the Christmas
you wished for?


1547
01:25:39.714 --> 01:25:40.977
Yes, it was wonderful.

1548
01:25:42.848 --> 01:25:46.286
But not quite
perfect, is it?


1549
01:25:52.205 --> 01:25:54.991
Merry Christmas.

1550
01:25:55.078 --> 01:25:57.036
The meeting got pushed to
the second week of January.


1551
01:26:02.085 --> 01:26:04.217
And, little brother, I think
you're ready to take this


1552
01:26:04.304 --> 01:26:07.394
on by yourself.

1553
01:26:07.481 --> 01:26:10.093
What, you mean it?Mark: Yeah.

1554
01:26:10.180 --> 01:26:11.529
We're gonna be Skypeing
every day though


1555
01:26:11.616 --> 01:26:13.313
to monitor your progress.

1556
01:26:13.400 --> 01:26:15.141
But, yes you can
go to Australia.


1557
01:26:18.101 --> 01:26:20.581
I think I'd rather
stay here.


1558
01:26:20.668 --> 01:26:24.629
Um... that's awesome,
I won't let you down.


1559
01:26:24.716 --> 01:26:25.543
I don't know what to say.

1560
01:26:25.630 --> 01:26:26.413
How did you do it?

1561
01:26:26.500 --> 01:26:28.546
I didn't.

1562
01:26:28.633 --> 01:26:29.938
Christmas is what
you make it.


1563
01:26:35.988 --> 01:26:38.643
If you'll excuse us,
I would like to steal her away.


1564
01:26:48.435 --> 01:26:49.262
Would you
like some cocoa, Santa?


1565
01:27:06.671 --> 01:27:07.846
Merry Christmas.

1566
01:27:07.933 --> 01:27:09.500
Merry Christmas.

1567
01:27:23.905 --> 01:27:26.038
Merry Christmas, Mark.

1568
01:27:26.125 --> 01:27:27.909
Merry Christmas, Ariel.
