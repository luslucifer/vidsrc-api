Freedom took two weeks

999
00:54:17.475 --> 00:54:20.509

put a halter on her.

1001
00:54:22.748 --> 00:54:24.114
Oh well, isn't that somethin'?

1002
00:54:24.116 --> 00:54:27.083
She's just lettin' you do it.

1003
00:54:27.085 --> 00:54:29.418
- Good girl.
- Look at that.


1004
00:54:29.420 --> 00:54:31.154
Well, that's a good girl.

1005
00:54:31.156 --> 00:54:32.489
See?

1006
00:54:32.491 --> 00:54:34.656
Told you she wanted to do this.

1007
00:54:34.658 --> 00:54:37.460
Maybe if you would
just apologize,


1008
00:54:37.462 --> 00:54:39.395
she would actually let you.

1009
00:54:39.397 --> 00:54:41.130

1011

just walk in front of her.


1012

- She walks with you anyway.

See?

1015
00:54:50.141 --> 00:54:52.174
- She's gonna walk with you.
- Good girl.


1016
00:54:52.176 --> 00:54:54.346
- Good girl.
- Nice and easy.

Hey!

1019
00:54:58.449 --> 00:54:59.415
You lied to me.

Caroline.

1021
00:55:00.919 --> 00:55:02.118
No, no, no, no, they sat
in my office yesterday.


1022
00:55:02.120 --> 00:55:03.652
They looked me
right in the face,


1023
00:55:03.654 --> 00:55:05.688
- and they lied to me.
- Okay, Caroline.


1024
00:55:05.690 --> 00:55:07.190
Just give 'em a chance.

1025
00:55:07.192 --> 00:55:08.891
No, I assure you.

1026
00:55:08.893 --> 00:55:09.993
The second that we found
out that she was missing,


1027
00:55:09.995 --> 00:55:12.127
we came right to the police.

1028
00:55:12.129 --> 00:55:13.563
And when was that?

1029
00:55:13.565 --> 00:55:15.063
That was a couple
of hours ago.


1030
00:55:15.065 --> 00:55:16.132
That's a lie.

1031
00:55:16.134 --> 00:55:18.467
She was missing yesterday, okay.

1032
00:55:18.469 --> 00:55:19.435
You didn't want to tell me,

1033
00:55:19.437 --> 00:55:21.136
because you wanted the check.

1034
00:55:21.138 --> 00:55:23.940
If anything happens to
this girl, it's on you.


1035
00:55:23.942 --> 00:55:25.674
Caroline, you're outta line.

1036
00:55:25.676 --> 00:55:26.842
We woke up this morning,

1037
00:55:26.844 --> 00:55:28.110
and she was gone.

1038
00:55:28.112 --> 00:55:29.846
When did you, uh,
take her to the doctor?


1039
00:55:29.848 --> 00:55:30.779
That was yesterday.

1040
00:55:30.781 --> 00:55:33.616
What doctor did you take her to?

1041
00:55:33.618 --> 00:55:35.717
I didn't take
her to the doctor.


1042
00:55:35.719 --> 00:55:36.719
See?

1043
00:55:36.721 --> 00:55:37.821
Another lie.

1044
00:55:37.823 --> 00:55:39.455
She was feeling better,

1045
00:55:39.457 --> 00:55:41.156
so I thought it was best
to take her back home.


1046
00:55:41.158 --> 00:55:42.958
I think she just
had a 24-hour flu.


1047
00:55:42.960 --> 00:55:46.094
Okay, all right, let's
focus on the bigger issue.


1048
00:55:46.096 --> 00:55:47.163
We have a missing girl.

1049
00:55:47.165 --> 00:55:48.598
Thank you.

1050
00:55:48.600 --> 00:55:50.500
Can we focus on what's
important here, please?


1051
00:55:50.502 --> 00:55:51.967
We're trying to
find our daughter.


1052
00:55:51.969 --> 00:55:53.837
Well, she couldn't have
gotten too far on foot.


1053
00:55:53.839 --> 00:55:56.105
Right, but if she's been
missing an extra 24 hours,


1054
00:55:56.107 --> 00:55:58.975
that drastically changes
the search parameters.


1055
00:55:58.977 --> 00:56:00.976
I don't appreciate
the accusations.


1056
00:56:00.978 --> 00:56:02.946
I think it's really inappropriate
coming from somebody


1057
00:56:02.948 --> 00:56:04.480
who's supposed to be
trying to help us.


1058
00:56:04.482 --> 00:56:06.482
I am not here to help you.

1059
00:56:06.484 --> 00:56:08.250
I am here for the
child's welfare.


1060
00:56:08.252 --> 00:56:09.786
Do you understand that?

1061
00:56:09.788 --> 00:56:10.920
All right, let's just

1062
00:56:10.922 --> 00:56:12.554
- settle down, okay?
- I can't.


1063
00:56:12.556 --> 00:56:13.922
- I can't with these people.
- Just settle down, all right.


1064
00:56:13.924 --> 00:56:16.826
Do you guys have any
idea where she could be?


1065
00:56:16.828 --> 00:56:20.797
We looked at all the farms,
all around town, nothing.


1066
00:56:20.799 --> 00:56:22.165
I mean, everybody
was really helpful,


1067
00:56:22.167 --> 00:56:23.565
except for Crowley.

1068
00:56:23.567 --> 00:56:26.168
Yeah, well, that's
the way old Ben can be.


1069
00:56:26.170 --> 00:56:29.705
That man's had a lot
of tragedy in his life.


1070
00:56:29.707 --> 00:56:32.775
Isn't that right, Caroline?

1071
00:56:32.777 --> 00:56:35.578
She would've gotten a lot
farther than the Crowley farm.


1072
00:56:35.580 --> 00:56:40.585
Besides, Ben Crowley is someone
you run away from, not to.


1073
00:56:41.185 --> 00:56:42.518
BEN: Okay.

1074
00:56:42.520 --> 00:56:43.823
Hot off the grill.

1075
00:56:47.091 --> 00:56:48.190
Pancakes for dinner?

1076
00:56:48.192 --> 00:56:49.926
Well, it's either that

1077
00:56:49.928 --> 00:56:51.864
or a nice, juicy steak.

1078
00:56:53.031 --> 00:56:55.297
Pancakes are much better.

1079
00:56:55.299 --> 00:56:58.234
So you never eat meat, huh?

1080
00:56:58.236 --> 00:57:01.237
Only when my foster
mom forces me to.


1081
00:57:01.239 --> 00:57:04.239
After my real mom
died, I went vegan.


1082
00:57:04.241 --> 00:57:05.842
I didn't want to kill
anything that had a mother


1083
00:57:05.844 --> 00:57:09.312
or could be a mother,
and plus it's healthier.


1084
00:57:09.314 --> 00:57:12.214
You need protein
for your muscles.


1085
00:57:12.216 --> 00:57:13.750
Look at horses.

1086
00:57:13.752 --> 00:57:15.752
They don't eat meat,
and they're strong.


1087
00:57:15.754 --> 00:57:18.022
You ain't a horse, honey.

1088
00:57:19.323 --> 00:57:22.759
So are you gonna have
a funeral for Freedom?


1089
00:57:22.761 --> 00:57:25.060
- A funeral?
- Yeah, yeah.


1090
00:57:25.062 --> 00:57:26.328
I think you should have one

1091
00:57:26.330 --> 00:57:28.297
I mean, I bet Orphan
would like it.


1092
00:57:28.299 --> 00:57:30.065
You grew up on
too many cartoons


1093
00:57:30.067 --> 00:57:32.969
of singin' fish and
talkin' donkeys.


1094
00:57:32.971 --> 00:57:36.605
Animals don't have funerals
for each other in nature.


1095
00:57:36.607 --> 00:57:37.607
You can learn a
lot from animals.


1096
00:57:37.609 --> 00:57:39.241
They move on.

1097
00:57:39.243 --> 00:57:43.011
They don't, they don't
linger in the past.


1098
00:57:43.013 --> 00:57:44.013
Well, if you
really believe that,


1099
00:57:44.015 --> 00:57:45.618
then why are you?

1100
00:57:48.252 --> 00:57:50.286
You don't know what
you're talking about.


1101
00:57:50.288 --> 00:57:54.757
Okay, no offense, but I
mean, look at this place,


1102
00:57:54.759 --> 00:57:57.960
the answering machine,
the rabbit ears.


1103
00:57:57.962 --> 00:58:00.996
You're clearly
lingering in the past.


1104
00:58:00.998 --> 00:58:04.333
Some of us only have the past.

1105
00:58:04.335 --> 00:58:05.301
You're a kid.

1106
00:58:05.303 --> 00:58:09.240
This'll be a distant
memory for you someday.


1107
00:58:11.609 --> 00:58:13.775
I still think you should
have a funeral for her.


1108
00:58:13.777 --> 00:58:18.651
Last thing I'm gonna do is
have a funeral for a horse.

Who wants to go first?

1111
00:58:32.096 --> 00:58:35.632
Why don't you let
the horse go first?


1112
00:58:35.634 --> 00:58:36.268
Right.
