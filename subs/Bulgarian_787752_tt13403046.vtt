2
00:01:24.623 --> 00:01:25.624
Какво?

3
00:01:41.056 --> 00:01:43.183
Момиче, майната му. Просто напусни.

4
00:01:43.266 --> 00:01:44.601
Знам. Като...

5
00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.396
Явно нямам нищо против да плащам,

6
00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:48.897
но какъв странен начин да започнете среща.

7
00:01:49.106 --> 00:01:50.232
Това казвам.

8
00:01:50.315 --> 00:01:51.858
Това ли казвате на децата си?

9
00:01:51.983 --> 00:01:54.695
„О, беше толкова романтично
преди първата ни среща, всички.

10
00:01:54.778 --> 00:01:58.073
„Той ми изпрати съобщение „За знание,
това място е само в брой“.“

11
00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.783
Не.

12
00:02:01.451 --> 00:02:02.744
вече съм тук.

13
00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:03.954
момиче...

14
00:02:04.121 --> 00:02:05.747
Наистина съм дяволски гладен.

15
00:02:05.831 --> 00:02:06.915
Ммм

16
00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:09.459
Не знам. Да се ​​надяваме,
че ще стане добра история.

17
00:02:09.543 --> 00:02:11.920
Обади ми се след това.

18
00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:14.214
- Обичам те. - Добре, обичам те повече.

19
00:02:14.381 --> 00:02:15.382
- Чао. - Чао.

20
00:02:15.465 --> 00:02:16.883
Чао чао.

21
00:02:16.967 --> 00:02:18.343
Чао!

22
00:02:19.302 --> 00:02:22.431
Добре, нека направим това.

23
00:02:25.058 --> 00:02:27.686
Така че обичам лют сос.

24
00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:30.021
Буквално просто го слагам върху всяко едно нещо

25
00:02:30.105 --> 00:02:31.815
Понякога мога да намеря из къщата.

26
00:02:31.898 --> 00:02:34.276
От пица до пилешки крилца.

27
00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:37.320
Even though it gives me terrible acid reflux.

28
00:02:37.404 --> 00:02:38.989
- Mmm. 
- It makes its way up to my throat

29
00:02:39.072 --> 00:02:40.949
and I literally feel like I'm gonna vomit.

30
00:02:41.575 --> 00:02:44.244
- So... 
- Oh, yeah. That, um, sucks.

31
00:02:44.327 --> 00:02:46.288
- Mmm. 
- But I love it, so...

32
00:02:46.371 --> 00:02:48.206
- Yeah. 
- Yeah.

33
00:02:48.415 --> 00:02:51.168
Like, I love wasabi, but, um,

34
00:02:51.376 --> 00:02:53.295
Mexican spices would be too much for me.

35
00:02:53.462 --> 00:02:56.381
- Mmm. Yeah. I get that. 
- Yeah.

36
00:02:56.882 --> 00:02:57.883
Yeah.

37
00:03:02.721 --> 00:03:03.764
Mmm.

38
00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:07.851
What?

39
00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:10.520
I had this crazy thought. I...

40
00:03:10.854 --> 00:03:12.230
I just feel like...

41
00:03:12.981 --> 00:03:14.900
the women in our parents' generation,

42
00:03:15.108 --> 00:03:18.987
they just cared more about how they dressed

43
00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.156
and just, kind of, how they looked.

44
00:03:21.948 --> 00:03:23.575
They were more into femininity.

45
00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:25.160
- You know what I mean? 
- Mmm.

46
00:03:25.243 --> 00:03:27.496
Like, nowadays, 
I feel like girls, they just wear

47
00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:29.956
oversized everything, like it's a blanket.

48
00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.083
Do you know what I mean? 
You know what I'm saying, right?

49
00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:33.418
- Um... 
- It's like...

50
00:03:33.502 --> 00:03:36.296
'Cause I think you would
just look great in a dress.

51
00:03:36.713 --> 00:03:39.132
Not that you don't
look good in a sweater,

52
00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:40.801
- но имам предвид, ако
бяхте... - Добре ли сте момчета?

53
00:03:40.884 --> 00:03:44.346
А, да. Хм, всъщност почти готово. Благодаря ти.

54
00:03:44.554 --> 00:03:47.098
Готино. Да, тогава просто ще приключим това.

55
00:03:47.933 --> 00:03:49.434
- Благодаря ти. - Моля.

56
00:03:49.893 --> 00:03:51.645
О, донесе ли пари?

57
00:03:51.812 --> 00:03:54.397
да. Ти ми напомни, така че...

58
00:03:54.481 --> 00:03:57.609
Брат ми идва в града.

59
00:03:57.692 --> 00:03:59.986
Ако е готино, просто ще грабна тези остатъци

60
00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:02.113
и, ъъъ, предполагам просто ще
те оставя да си тръгнеш...

61
00:04:02.197 --> 00:04:03.240
Готино. не, да.

62
00:04:03.365 --> 00:04:05.367
... няколко долара по-малко на бакшиша.

63
00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:06.660
Ако това има смисъл.

64
00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.831
Вашият шал се потапя в юфката.

65
00:04:10.914 --> 00:04:12.707
О, по дяволите!

66
00:04:12.791 --> 00:04:13.834
мамка му!

67
00:04:15.043 --> 00:04:17.420
Обичам този шал. хм...

68
00:04:17.504 --> 00:04:19.464
Извинете ме? Извинете ме.

69
00:04:19.631 --> 00:04:20.882
Бързо, ела.

70
00:04:21.591 --> 00:04:24.302
Здравейте, имате ли газирана вода?

71
00:04:24.386 --> 00:04:25.887
- Искрящо. - Ммм-хм. да.

72
00:04:26.012 --> 00:04:27.848
- Мехурче. Знаеш ли
мехурчетата? - Да да да.

73
00:04:28.557 --> 00:04:30.058
И лимон, моля?

74
00:04:31.059 --> 00:04:32.644
Не знам дали тя разбра какво казах.

75
00:04:32.727 --> 00:04:33.812
Не мисля, че говори английски.

76
00:04:44.447 --> 00:04:46.825
Това беше, ъъ, това беше забавно.

77
00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:49.077
Наистина си сладък.

78
00:04:49.327 --> 00:04:51.037
- Благодаря ти. - Да.

79
00:04:51.746 --> 00:04:53.665
Трябва да направим това отново някой път.

80
00:04:54.541 --> 00:04:56.585
Да, виж, Чад, хм...

81
00:04:56.668 --> 00:04:58.712
да.

82
00:04:58.795 --> 00:05:00.672
ох. Аз... аз не

83
00:05:00.922 --> 00:05:03.633
мисля, че наистина си съвпадаме. Ти знаеш?

84
00:05:03.758 --> 00:05:04.885
Еха.

85
00:05:05.093 --> 00:05:06.678
Буквално просто се държах учтиво.

86
00:05:06.761 --> 00:05:08.930
Ти дори не си мой
тип, честно казано, така че...

87
00:05:09.764 --> 00:05:10.807
Добре.

88
00:05:10.891 --> 00:05:13.852
О, това е смешно? "Ха-ха, смешно е"? да.

89
00:05:13.935 --> 00:05:16.813
Добре. Успех с намирането на човек, мръсна кучко.

90
00:05:19.316 --> 00:05:20.483
един...

91
00:05:25.447 --> 00:05:27.866
Какво по дяволите.

92
00:06:04.736 --> 00:06:05.737
О, по дяволите.

93
00:06:13.286 --> 00:06:15.246
ох. Глупав идиот.

94
00:06:16.122 --> 00:06:18.083
Може ли просто да
му пишете и да пишете,

95
00:06:18.208 --> 00:06:21.461
— Майната ти и грозния ти шал, кучко.

96
00:06:21.586 --> 00:06:24.089
О, виж, иска ми се да
се сетих за това в момента.

97
00:06:24.297 --> 00:06:26.257
Вместо това просто стоях там като идиот.

98
00:06:26.341 --> 00:06:27.884
- Да превключим. - Да.

99
00:06:28.218 --> 00:06:29.886
Не знам как го правиш, Моли.

100
00:06:30.512 --> 00:06:31.596
Какво да направя?

101
00:06:31.763 --> 00:06:33.014
Запознанства с хора.

102
00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:35.850
И винаги оставам сам.

103
00:06:36.142 --> 00:06:39.270
С което, между другото, съм много окей.

104
00:06:40.397 --> 00:06:41.856
Не не. Какво?

105
00:06:42.607 --> 00:06:45.986
Нямаш нужда от мъж, става ли? Или
който и да е, по този въпрос.

106
00:06:46.528 --> 00:06:50.156
Просто така сме отгледани
от шибаните филми на Дисни.

107
00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.367
- Да. Майната му Ариел. - Майната й.

108
00:06:52.534 --> 00:06:54.577
Тъпата кучка остави цялото море заради мъж.

109
00:06:54.661 --> 00:06:55.787
Хайде сега.

110
00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:57.330
Като, по дяволите... Майната му на красотата.

111
00:06:57.455 --> 00:06:59.374
Да, майната му на Звяра. аз съм звярът.

112
00:06:59.457 --> 00:07:01.876
Ти си звярът! Вземи го!

113
00:07:03.962 --> 00:07:06.214
Време, всички!

114
00:07:06.423 --> 00:07:09.217
Ооо! Страхотна работа днес, а?

115
00:07:09.467 --> 00:07:10.719
имам предвид това.

116
00:07:11.011 --> 00:07:12.971
А сега си ръкопляскайте.

117
00:07:13.054 --> 00:07:15.015
Ооо!

118
00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:16.141
Добра работа!

119
00:07:16.224 --> 00:07:18.601
- Бам! - О!

120
00:07:18.727 --> 00:07:20.812
- Ти си мощен! - Ти си мощен!

121
00:07:20.979 --> 00:07:22.731
- Виж колко си силен. - Виж това.

122
00:08:42.143 --> 00:08:43.228
О, по дяволите.

123
00:09:21.349 --> 00:09:23.143
Имали ли сте някога такива?

124
00:09:27.397 --> 00:09:28.398
грозде?

125
00:09:28.731 --> 00:09:31.067
Не. Захарен памук грозде.

126
00:09:31.192 --> 00:09:33.236
На вкус са точно
като тях. не се шегувам.

127
00:09:33.695 --> 00:09:34.863
- Наистина ли? - Да.

128
00:09:35.071 --> 00:09:36.447
Казах на сестра ми и племенницата ми.

129
00:09:36.614 --> 00:09:37.740
Те бяха като: "Няма начин, майната ти."

130
00:09:37.866 --> 00:09:39.617
Така че сега ги вземам на път натам.

131
00:09:39.701 --> 00:09:41.202
Племенницата ти каза: "Майната ти"?

132
00:09:41.369 --> 00:09:43.830
да. Четиригодишните са луди.

133
00:09:46.249 --> 00:09:47.250
Добре.

134
00:09:47.876 --> 00:09:49.210
Мога да кажа, че не ми вярваш,

135
00:09:49.377 --> 00:09:51.212
така че ще трябва да опиташ един.

136
00:09:51.337 --> 00:09:53.423
Не искам да си тръгваш от
тук с мисълта, че съм чудак.

137
00:09:57.427 --> 00:09:58.428
Добре.

138
00:10:05.018 --> 00:10:06.311
- Нали така? - По дяволите. Ммм

139
00:10:07.395 --> 00:10:08.855
- Еха. - Наука.

140
00:10:08.938 --> 00:10:11.733
да. Давай наука.

141
00:10:12.317 --> 00:10:13.526
Живееш ли наблизо?

142
00:10:14.652 --> 00:10:16.779
Защото живея на шеста пътека.

143
00:10:16.988 --> 00:10:18.698
Просто идвам в раздела за плодове

144
00:10:18.781 --> 00:10:20.950
да говоря със случайни, много добре изглеждащи хора

145
00:10:21.034 --> 00:10:22.493
които стоят близо до него.

146
00:10:24.495 --> 00:10:25.538
Това беше ужасно.

147
00:10:26.164 --> 00:10:27.207
Това беше някак ужасно.

148
00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:29.375
- Толкова съжалявам. - Добре е.

149
00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:30.627
Лека нощ.

150
00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:32.503
Добре. Ти също.

151
00:10:38.009 --> 00:10:39.302
Знаеш ли какво? Майната му.

152
00:10:39.385 --> 00:10:42.222
Вече развалям това, така че просто ще продължа.

153
00:10:42.931 --> 00:10:45.058
Мислиш ли, че мога да получа номера ти?

154
00:10:45.183 --> 00:10:47.685
- О. - Наистина просто имам история

155
00:10:47.769 --> 00:10:49.437
за сестра ми и
племенницата ми, когато ги видя.

156
00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:51.731
Защото мисля, че ще говорим за гроздето.

157
00:10:51.814 --> 00:10:53.399
О, разбира се. да.

158
00:10:53.608 --> 00:10:55.485
Тогава мога да им кажа,
че съм срещнал някой друг

159
00:10:55.693 --> 00:10:57.737
който се чувства по същия начин.

160
00:10:57.820 --> 00:10:59.322
Сигурен. Има смисъл, да.

161
00:11:00.114 --> 00:11:01.115
Добре.

162
00:11:03.534 --> 00:11:06.246
Можем да се срещнем тук следващата седмица,
за да поговорим за броколите, ако искате.

163
00:11:06.329 --> 00:11:07.747
Звучи добре.

164
00:11:09.916 --> 00:11:10.917
ох.

165
00:11:12.001 --> 00:11:13.461
- Мъгла. - Дъждовна гора.

166
00:11:15.338 --> 00:11:17.173
Винаги е хубаво да имаш малко мъгла, Ноа.

167
00:11:17.257 --> 00:11:18.716
- Yes, mystery. 
- Yeah.

168
00:11:19.259 --> 00:11:20.385
I'm Steve.

169
00:11:21.344 --> 00:11:23.137
- It's nice to meet you. 
- You, too.

170
00:11:23.304 --> 00:11:25.848
I'm not gonna text you,
but I'll really want to.

171
00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:29.018
Good night.

172
00:11:29.102 --> 00:11:30.228
Good night.

173
00:11:34.023 --> 00:11:35.149
- What? 
- Yeah.

174
00:11:35.316 --> 00:11:36.567
- Your number? 
- Yeah.

175
00:11:36.651 --> 00:11:38.278
- In a grocery store? 
- Yeah.

176
00:11:38.361 --> 00:11:39.779
- The other night? 
- Yes.

177
00:11:39.946 --> 00:11:41.489
And you're just now telling me today?

178
00:11:41.614 --> 00:11:42.782
Wow.

179
00:11:42.907 --> 00:11:44.158
When you think you had a friend.

180
00:11:44.242 --> 00:11:46.244
No, I just think it
was weird, you know? He was...

181
00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:50.331
He was cute and funny and...

182
00:11:50.415 --> 00:11:51.416
Mmm. Okay.

183
00:11:51.541 --> 00:11:54.711
I didn't think people met people
in real life anymore, you know?

184
00:11:54.794 --> 00:11:57.171
He's probably married.

185
00:11:57.255 --> 00:11:59.215
Thank you for that. 
Yes, he's probably married.

186
00:11:59.299 --> 00:12:00.466
Probably.

187
00:12:00.633 --> 00:12:02.427
Like, I'm already thinking about the fact

188
00:12:02.552 --> 00:12:04.137
- he hasn't texted. 
- Mmm.

189
00:12:04.262 --> 00:12:06.848
That's one of the things
I love about dating women.

190
00:12:06.931 --> 00:12:10.727
Less games, more emotional dependence, you know?

191
00:12:12.979 --> 00:12:14.105
So don't play the games,

192
00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:16.482
just be you straight
out the gate. Fuck it.

193
00:12:16.566 --> 00:12:17.567
Maybe.

194
00:12:18.026 --> 00:12:20.153
Hey, do you want to come over later?

195
00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:22.572
- I could use some emotional dependence. 
- Aww.

196
00:12:22.697 --> 00:12:25.408
Well, my emotional dependence ain't cheap, boo.

197
00:12:25.491 --> 00:12:27.118
Let me tell you.

198
00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:48.181
- Hi. 
- Hey!

199
00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:51.017
How you doin'?

200
00:12:51.267 --> 00:12:53.770
- Good, thanks. How are you? 
- Good. Good.

201
00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:55.772
This place is really nice.

202
00:12:55.855 --> 00:12:57.648
- Yeah. 
- The bears are, you know...

203
00:12:57.732 --> 00:13:01.652
Yeah. It's like the perfect amount
of, you know, grimy, but hip.

204
00:13:01.736 --> 00:13:02.737
Exactly.

205
00:13:04.572 --> 00:13:06.699
- You guys know what you want? 
- Hi. Um...

206
00:13:06.824 --> 00:13:11.412
Can I get a Manhattan with, like,
as many cherries as you can spare, please?

207
00:13:11.579 --> 00:13:14.040
- Cherries. I like that. 
- I love cherries.

208
00:13:14.207 --> 00:13:15.917
Yeah. I'll do one
more of these, thank you.

209
00:13:16.084 --> 00:13:17.085
Copy.

210
00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:18.836
Here you go. Here.

211
00:13:19.003 --> 00:13:20.463
- Thank you. 
- You're welcome.

212
00:13:20.755 --> 00:13:21.839
Ay-yo.

213
00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:25.510
- Hi. 
- Hey.

214
00:13:25.593 --> 00:13:26.636
- I'm Steve. 
- Oh.

215
00:13:26.969 --> 00:13:28.012
Noa.

216
00:13:28.096 --> 00:13:29.138
Um...

217
00:13:29.222 --> 00:13:32.767
All right, so, uh... 
Here come the dumb questions.

218
00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:34.185
От къде си?

219
00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:37.105
Хм, първоначално съм от източното крайбрежие,

220
00:13:37.188 --> 00:13:38.231
- да. - Хубаво.

221
00:13:38.398 --> 00:13:39.482
Ами ти?

222
00:13:39.565 --> 00:13:41.567
- Аз съм от
Тексас. да. - О. Готино.

223
00:13:41.692 --> 00:13:42.944
Какво те доведе тук?

224
00:13:43.027 --> 00:13:44.570
Втората ми резиденция.

225
00:13:44.695 --> 00:13:46.572
- О! Резиденция. - Да.

226
00:13:46.739 --> 00:13:47.949
ти доктор ли си...

227
00:13:48.032 --> 00:13:49.450
- Лекар? - Аз съм лекар. да.

228
00:13:49.534 --> 00:13:50.618
О! Еха!

229
00:13:50.743 --> 00:13:53.121
- Да. да. Хм... - Това е впечатляващо.

230
00:13:53.204 --> 00:13:57.333
Аз просто... Работя в реконструктивната хирургия.

231
00:13:57.708 --> 00:13:59.877
Имаш предвид пластичната хирургия.

232
00:14:00.044 --> 00:14:01.462
- Мда. Това е този. - Точно така.

233
00:14:01.587 --> 00:14:02.964
- Има само един. - Добре.

234
00:14:04.173 --> 00:14:05.633
Но не всичко е операция на носа.

235
00:14:05.716 --> 00:14:07.260
Не, разбира се. Имаш, знаеш ли...

236
00:14:07.343 --> 00:14:08.719
- Работа с цици. - Работа с цици.

237
00:14:08.803 --> 00:14:11.389
- Имаш повдигане на дупето. - Импланти.

238
00:14:11.806 --> 00:14:13.307
- Лифтинг на лице - Лифтинг на лице.

239
00:14:13.433 --> 00:14:14.434
Но знаете ли, от време на време

240
00:14:14.517 --> 00:14:16.185
Ще помогна на някого, което обаче е хубаво.

241
00:14:16.352 --> 00:14:18.938
Имаше едно дете онзи ден, което влезе,

242
00:14:19.021 --> 00:14:21.274
който е претърпял катастрофа
и е бил тежко изгорен.

243
00:14:21.357 --> 00:14:24.068
Значи има и това.

244
00:14:24.235 --> 00:14:25.570
Просто се шегувах. Съжалявам.

245
00:14:25.653 --> 00:14:26.904
- Ето. - Благодаря ти.

246
00:14:26.988 --> 00:14:29.699
- That is amazing. 
- Don't worry.

247
00:14:29.991 --> 00:14:31.117
That work for you?

248
00:14:31.742 --> 00:14:33.411
- Wow. Yes. 
- That do the trick?

249
00:14:33.536 --> 00:14:35.580
- 'Cause that's all we got. 
- I'm sorry. That's...

250
00:14:35.830 --> 00:14:36.789
Perfect.

251
00:14:36.956 --> 00:14:38.624
I only meant, like, a couple. Thank you.

252
00:14:38.708 --> 00:14:39.709
Cheers.

253
00:14:42.336 --> 00:14:44.255
So, what about your family?

254
00:14:45.047 --> 00:14:48.468
Uh... Well, I, um, 
I don't have any siblings

255
00:14:48.593 --> 00:14:51.095
and my dad died a while back, so...

256
00:14:51.179 --> 00:14:55.141
I'm not sure where my mom
is anymore because we don't talk.

257
00:14:55.975 --> 00:14:57.185
- Yeah. 
- I'm sorry.

258
00:14:57.435 --> 00:14:59.312
It's fine. Um...

259
00:14:59.562 --> 00:15:01.606
- What about your family? 
- Oh...

260
00:15:01.772 --> 00:15:05.943
My dad is in Texas
and my mom passed away, actually.

261
00:15:06.027 --> 00:15:07.570
- Sorry. 
- So... But it's...

262
00:15:07.653 --> 00:15:09.489
- I'm sorry. 
- It's okay. It's okay.

263
00:15:09.572 --> 00:15:12.158
Well, we have something in common, I guess.

264
00:15:12.325 --> 00:15:14.076
- Yeah, dead parents. 
- Yeah.

265
00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:15.203
- Perfect. 
- Great.

266
00:15:15.286 --> 00:15:19.499
Let's cheers to that.

267
00:15:38.976 --> 00:15:39.977
...coordinated like that.

268
00:15:40.061 --> 00:15:41.562
- So you don't have Instagram. 
- Nope.

269
00:15:41.687 --> 00:15:43.689
Wow. What about, um, Twitter?

270
00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:46.108
- Definitely not. 
- No?

271
00:15:46.192 --> 00:15:48.402
Някой казва ли нещо умно в Twitter?

272
00:15:48.486 --> 00:15:49.487
Вярно е.

273
00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:51.906
Няма начин. Хайде. Това е най-лошото.

274
00:15:52.031 --> 00:15:55.409
Искам да кажа, как
трябва да те преследвам сега?

275
00:15:55.785 --> 00:15:58.746
Просто ще трябва да го направите лично.

276
00:15:58.829 --> 00:16:01.999
Ти знаеш. Появи се в
къщата ми, по старомоден начин.

277
00:16:02.124 --> 00:16:03.125
Изпратете ми писмо!

278
00:16:03.209 --> 00:16:04.502
- Това би било хубаво.
- Това би било хубаво.

279
00:16:04.669 --> 00:16:05.711
"Най-скъп..."

280
00:16:05.795 --> 00:16:07.672
"Искрено Ваш." Добре, ще го направя.

281
00:16:07.755 --> 00:16:09.173
Бих искал това. Това би докоснало сърцето ми.

282
00:16:09.257 --> 00:16:10.633
Това звучи добре.

283
00:16:19.016 --> 00:16:20.017
Какво?

284
00:16:21.602 --> 00:16:23.729
Не, просто имаш хубава усмивка.

285
00:16:25.773 --> 00:16:27.400
- Добре. - Ти правиш.

286
00:16:28.651 --> 00:16:31.028
Добре, добре. Хайде да играем игра.

287
00:16:31.237 --> 00:16:33.990
Хм... Кажи ми нещо,
което не искаш да знам.

288
00:16:34.073 --> 00:16:36.867
- Хм... Забавна игра. Добре. - Да.

289
00:16:37.577 --> 00:16:38.828
Ооо Рисковано е.

290
00:16:40.329 --> 00:16:41.497
ммм...

291
00:16:41.872 --> 00:16:43.457
да. хм...

292
00:16:44.917 --> 00:16:46.127
аз...

293
00:16:47.169 --> 00:16:48.546
мразя това.

294
00:16:50.965 --> 00:16:52.300
Искам да кажа, хм...

295
00:16:52.383 --> 00:16:54.427
Добре. Съжалявам.

296
00:16:54.510 --> 00:16:58.264
Не ти, защото изглеждаш готин, но... Не, аз...

297
00:16:59.348 --> 00:17:01.809
Мразя, като, да излизам.

298
00:17:02.268 --> 00:17:03.311
Ммм

299
00:17:03.394 --> 00:17:05.563
Ти знаеш? Всичко за това.

300
00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:07.231
Харесването...

301
00:17:08.441 --> 00:17:10.818
Неудобният преамбюл.

302
00:17:11.193 --> 00:17:13.821
Харесвания, въпроси и други неща. Харесването...

303
00:17:14.572 --> 00:17:16.907
Знаеш ли, изпращане на съобщения.

304
00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:20.286
- Перфектната проекция. - Да.

305
00:17:20.369 --> 00:17:22.747
Всичко за това. Честно казано.

306
00:17:24.290 --> 00:17:26.292
Не знам, просто си мисля, че...

307
00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:33.424
хората, които вярват в
истинската любов са шибани идиоти.

308
00:17:34.925 --> 00:17:36.385
Толкова тъпа.

309
00:17:36.469 --> 00:17:38.095
- Те са. - Толкова са тъпи.

310
00:17:38.304 --> 00:17:43.309
Например, ние влагаме всичките си надежди
да намерим щастието чрез някой друг.

311
00:17:43.392 --> 00:17:45.269
И просто си мисля, че като,

312
00:17:46.729 --> 00:17:49.065
Не знам, може би
не е предназначено за мен,

313
00:17:50.149 --> 00:17:53.402
защото толкова дълго бях сама,

314
00:17:53.944 --> 00:17:56.280
Всъщност съм доста добър в това.

315
00:17:57.740 --> 00:17:58.741
Майната му.

316
00:18:24.642 --> 00:18:25.643
Какво?

317
00:18:26.769 --> 00:18:29.438
Не, просто... Може би е малко прекалено.

318
00:18:30.231 --> 00:18:31.565
Малко твърде бързо.

319
00:18:32.650 --> 00:18:33.901
О, уау.

320
00:18:34.985 --> 00:18:38.114
Не мисля, че някога съм
чувал човек да казва това.

321
00:18:38.948 --> 00:18:41.409
Ъм, мога ли...

322
00:18:41.575 --> 00:18:44.453
Мога ли да ти донеса нещо за пиене?

323
00:18:45.204 --> 00:18:46.497
Или яде?

324
00:18:47.957 --> 00:18:49.375
Не само...

325
00:18:50.835 --> 00:18:52.044
Само ти.

326
00:20:23.469 --> 00:20:25.221
Ммм

327
00:20:26.764 --> 00:20:28.265
- Сутрин. - Добро утро.

328
00:20:28.349 --> 00:20:30.935
Здравейте.

329
00:20:34.021 --> 00:20:35.689
кафе?

330
00:20:36.273 --> 00:20:38.025
Да, да, моля.

331
00:20:38.484 --> 00:20:40.528
Просто за да скрия този сутрешен дъх.

332
00:20:40.694 --> 00:20:43.364
О, Боже. Толкова ли е лошо?

333
00:20:43.531 --> 00:20:44.740
О, не.

334
00:20:46.659 --> 00:20:48.202
Не пускам ръката ти.

335
00:20:48.327 --> 00:20:50.871
Махам се. Махам се.

336
00:21:16.856 --> 00:21:18.399
О, правихме секс.

337
00:21:18.524 --> 00:21:20.276
Вземете това D!

338
00:21:21.902 --> 00:21:24.697
Някъде между второто и третото питие бях като,

339
00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:26.240
— Майната му.

340
00:21:26.949 --> 00:21:28.701
И всъщност беше много освобождаващо.

341
00:21:28.784 --> 00:21:32.079
Моят съвет "Майната му" винаги работи. по дяволите.

342
00:21:32.204 --> 00:21:34.623
Например, дори не се притеснявах как изглеждам

343
00:21:34.748 --> 00:21:37.418
или като, ако отнемах твърде много време.

344
00:21:37.501 --> 00:21:38.878
Добре!

345
00:21:39.003 --> 00:21:41.213
Какъв е неговият Instagram? Искам да дебна малко.

346
00:21:41.297 --> 00:21:42.840
О, той няма такъв.

347
00:21:43.007 --> 00:21:44.425
- Кажи какво? - Да.

348
00:21:44.508 --> 00:21:45.593
Какво означава?

349
00:21:45.676 --> 00:21:48.470
О, не, виж, това е сенчесто.

350
00:21:48.554 --> 00:21:50.055
Съжалявам. Червено знаме.

351
00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:53.225
Добре. Както и да е. Спри
да вали на моя секс парад.

352
00:21:53.309 --> 00:21:54.852
Моля те?

353
00:21:54.977 --> 00:21:57.688
О, между другото, помниш ли Пол?

354
00:21:58.063 --> 00:22:00.107
- Пол? - Той беше нашият барман.

355
00:22:00.232 --> 00:22:03.360
О да. Ау, Пол!

356
00:22:03.485 --> 00:22:05.738
Знаеш ли, не помня
защо спряхме да се свързваме.

357
00:22:05.821 --> 00:22:07.281
Той беше добър човек.

358
00:22:07.406 --> 00:22:08.991
И също добре се целува.

359
00:22:09.074 --> 00:22:11.327
Вероятно защото не можеш да бъдеш опитомен.

360
00:22:11.410 --> 00:22:12.995
Трябва да се скитате безплатно.

361
00:22:13.078 --> 00:22:14.288
Това е вярно.

362
00:22:14.538 --> 00:22:17.458
Добре, добре, трябва да се
върна на работа. Обичам те.

363
00:22:17.541 --> 00:22:19.877
- Добре, обичам те повече. Чао! - Чао!

364
00:22:27.593 --> 00:22:30.471
Трябва да опитате тези
къси ребра, те са луди.

365
00:22:30.554 --> 00:22:34.141
Да, изглеждат много добре, но аз...

366
00:22:36.018 --> 00:22:37.603
Просто не ям животни.

367
00:22:37.978 --> 00:22:39.021
О!

368
00:22:39.104 --> 00:22:42.107
Но... Но продължавайте да ядете. Недей... Не спирай.

369
00:22:42.191 --> 00:22:44.401
Всъщност искам да завършиш тази чиния.

370
00:22:44.485 --> 00:22:46.612
Осмелявам те да завършиш тази чиния.

371
00:22:49.698 --> 00:22:51.951
- Не! - Не, не... Защо?

372
00:22:52.034 --> 00:22:53.744
- Това ми е любимото... - Но така...

373
00:22:53.869 --> 00:22:55.371
... шибани къси ребра.

374
00:22:55.537 --> 00:22:58.165
- Хей, слушай, трябва да ядеш... -
Не мога. Ти ми го развали сега.

375
00:22:58.248 --> 00:22:59.333
да.

376
00:22:59.416 --> 00:23:02.044
Ще си измия ръцете, мисля.

377
00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:07.341
И така, казвал ли
си на някого за мен?

378
00:23:07.549 --> 00:23:09.760
Може би.

379
00:23:10.803 --> 00:23:12.805
Най-добрата ми приятелка, Моли.

380
00:23:13.764 --> 00:23:17.017
Какво каза на най-добрата си приятелка, Моли?

381
00:23:17.309 --> 00:23:21.605
Хм, че срещнах готин човек.

382
00:23:22.147 --> 00:23:24.233
А може и да го харесвам.

383
00:23:24.316 --> 00:23:26.485
- Само, като, малко. - Хм нали.

384
00:23:26.652 --> 00:23:29.279
- Разкажи ми повече за Моли. - Хм...

385
00:23:29.446 --> 00:23:34.576
Е, срещнахме се, като, мисля,
че беше преди седем години,

386
00:23:34.702 --> 00:23:38.497
хм, когато за първи път
се преместих тук. Работихме малко заедно.

387
00:23:39.289 --> 00:23:42.251
Мислете, че наистина ще се разберете.

388
00:23:42.376 --> 00:23:43.377
Хмм

389
00:23:45.170 --> 00:23:49.008
Не знам за вас, но аз съм претъпкан.

390
00:23:50.676 --> 00:23:52.511
Мисля, че трябва да танцуваме.

391
00:23:52.636 --> 00:23:54.054
Какво?

392
00:23:54.596 --> 00:23:56.306
Да тръгваме. Хайде.

393
00:23:56.932 --> 00:23:59.101
да. Да, да, да вървим, да вървим.

394
00:23:59.226 --> 00:24:00.728
- Искам да видя тези движения. - Добре.

395
00:24:00.811 --> 00:24:02.688
Искам да видя тези
движения. Влезте в центъра тук.

396
00:24:02.771 --> 00:24:04.940
Позволете ми да обърна това.

397
00:24:05.065 --> 00:24:06.108
Ето ни.

398
00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:10.821
Добре.

399
00:24:10.904 --> 00:24:12.197
Само малко поклащане.

400
00:24:12.322 --> 00:24:15.284
Засега това е само малка две стъпки.

401
00:24:15.409 --> 00:24:17.870
- Всичко е в малките
ходове. - Всичко е в лицето.

402
00:24:17.995 --> 00:24:19.872
В раменете е.

403
00:24:19.955 --> 00:24:21.123
Искам да кажа, мога да скача.

404
00:24:21.248 --> 00:24:23.250
О, тазобедрената тяга! Боже мой.

405
00:24:23.333 --> 00:24:25.127
Не, нямаш...

406
00:24:25.210 --> 00:24:27.171
Това. Че.

407
00:24:30.716 --> 00:24:32.426
- Да. На мен.
- О, не, не. Добре.

408
00:24:32.593 --> 00:24:34.136
Добре, добре, добре, добре.

409
00:24:34.219 --> 00:24:36.096
Изглежда, че се занимаваме със салса.

410
00:24:36.889 --> 00:24:37.973
Това е салса.

411
00:24:40.350 --> 00:24:42.811
- Вие сте... ходове. - Боже мой.

412
00:24:46.648 --> 00:24:48.484
Трябва да. Трябва да.

413
00:24:48.567 --> 00:24:51.361
Съжалявам. Наистина съжалявам. Беше наистина добра снимка.

414
00:24:51.445 --> 00:24:53.822
- Трябва да изтриете това.
- Никога няма да изтрия това.

415
00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:00.204
Трябва да отидем някъде.

416
00:25:03.749 --> 00:25:04.958
Искаш ли да?

417
00:25:07.127 --> 00:25:09.379
А, да.

418
00:25:09.505 --> 00:25:11.173
- Да? - Да, хм...

419
00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:12.800
Майната му. Защо не?

420
00:25:13.842 --> 00:25:15.385
Искам да кажа, къде?

421
00:25:15.552 --> 00:25:16.929
Където и да е.

422
00:25:17.429 --> 00:25:19.473
Някъде... Някъде хубаво.

423
00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:22.476
Някъде... забавно.

424
00:25:27.189 --> 00:25:29.066
Може би ще бъде изненада.

425
00:25:31.443 --> 00:25:32.569
Майната му.

426
00:25:32.653 --> 00:25:33.654
да.

427
00:25:35.572 --> 00:25:36.573
да.

428
00:25:37.241 --> 00:25:40.160
Заминавам със Стив за уикенда.

429
00:25:40.244 --> 00:25:42.162
Какво? Където?

430
00:25:42.246 --> 00:25:44.081
- Това е изненада. - Чакай, Ноа.

431
00:25:45.541 --> 00:25:49.253
Ъъъъъ. Изненада? това не ми харесва.

432
00:25:49.336 --> 00:25:52.881
Просто ще го направя. Ти
каза: "Майната му", помниш ли?

433
00:25:53.006 --> 00:25:56.093
Момиче, всички вие сте се забъркали.
Дори не съм го виждал този пич.

434
00:25:56.176 --> 00:25:58.178
О, мамка му, съвсем забравих. дръж се.

435
00:25:58.345 --> 00:25:59.471
Изпращам ти негова снимка.

436
00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:05.435
Искам да кажа, той изглежда сладък,

437
00:26:05.519 --> 00:26:08.313
но едва мога да кажа, мръсник.

438
00:26:08.438 --> 00:26:10.858
Хм, той е нелепо сладък.

439
00:26:10.983 --> 00:26:14.486
Ще ти изпратя съобщение, щом стигнем там
и ще ти уведомя всичко, става ли?

440
00:26:14.570 --> 00:26:15.571
Добре, добре.

441
00:26:16.446 --> 00:26:18.407
Хм, развълнуван съм от теб.

442
00:26:18.532 --> 00:26:21.160
Това е сбъдната фантазия на направо момиче, нали?

443
00:26:21.243 --> 00:26:22.703
нали така?

444
00:26:22.828 --> 00:26:24.830
- Обичам те. - Обичам те повече.

445
00:26:24.913 --> 00:26:26.290
- Чао. - Чао.

446
00:26:31.837 --> 00:26:33.172
- Хей. - Здравей.

447
00:26:33.255 --> 00:26:35.716
Съжалявам. Денят ми протече дълго.

448
00:26:36.008 --> 00:26:38.427
Слушай, ще трябва да тръгваме сутринта.

449
00:26:38.552 --> 00:26:41.096
Току що проверих трафика и това е кошмар.

450
00:26:41.221 --> 00:26:42.973
Така че реших, че може
би ще отидем при мен

451
00:26:43.098 --> 00:26:45.058
и тогава, знаеш, утре тръгваме първо.

452
00:26:45.142 --> 00:26:46.894
- Готино ли е? - Да. Добре.

453
00:26:47.227 --> 00:26:48.604
Виж се.

454
00:26:49.813 --> 00:26:50.814
Добре.

455
00:26:51.648 --> 00:26:52.691
Развълнуван съм.

456
00:27:14.504 --> 00:27:16.465
Как си?

457
00:27:16.548 --> 00:27:18.592
- Добре ли си? - Да. Добре.

458
00:27:22.971 --> 00:27:25.015
майната му. просто ще ти кажа.

459
00:27:26.016 --> 00:27:28.227
Отиваме в Котидж Гроув. Това е изненадата.

460
00:27:28.894 --> 00:27:30.020
Това е.

461
00:27:30.145 --> 00:27:31.480
- Наистина ли? - Да.

462
00:27:31.563 --> 00:27:33.273
- Това ли е изненадата? - Да.

463
00:27:33.398 --> 00:27:35.067
Какво? Винаги съм искал да отида.

464
00:27:35.150 --> 00:27:36.235
Не казваш ли просто това?

465
00:27:36.318 --> 00:27:38.028
Не казвам само това. Не, наистина имам.

466
00:27:38.278 --> 00:27:42.157
Искам да кажа, че мразя изненадите,
така че се радвам, че ми каза.

467
00:27:42.241 --> 00:27:43.492
Да, ще бъде добре.

468
00:27:45.827 --> 00:27:46.995
ъъъъ Мобилната ми не работи.

469
00:27:47.371 --> 00:27:49.248
Да, услугата е, хм,

470
00:27:49.373 --> 00:27:51.583
гадно, но при мен ще стане по-добре.

471
00:27:52.459 --> 00:27:53.460
Готино.

472
00:28:44.553 --> 00:28:45.887
Чист въздух, нали?

473
00:28:46.096 --> 00:28:47.180
да.

474
00:28:47.514 --> 00:28:48.807
Удивително е.

475
00:28:48.932 --> 00:28:50.142
Кой знаеше?

476
00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:17.961
ох.

477
00:29:19.254 --> 00:29:22.049
Доста разочароващо.

478
00:29:47.032 --> 00:29:49.284
Оразмеряваш ме?

479
00:29:49.368 --> 00:29:50.702
ох. да.

480
00:29:50.869 --> 00:29:52.120
Мирише хубаво.

481
00:29:53.997 --> 00:29:55.791
Сестра ми го взе.

482
00:29:56.416 --> 00:29:58.752
Явно тя мисли, че харесвам сандалово дърво.

483
00:29:58.877 --> 00:30:01.046
Добре.

484
00:30:05.133 --> 00:30:06.426
Имаш ли, хм...

485
00:30:06.510 --> 00:30:07.844
Имате ли Wi
-Fi?

486
00:30:08.887 --> 00:30:10.472
Все още няма услуга.

487
00:30:10.597 --> 00:30:12.307
По дяволите, сигурно пак съм излязъл.

488
00:30:12.849 --> 00:30:14.017
Между другото,

489
00:30:14.393 --> 00:30:17.020
хм, правя моя собствена версия

490
00:30:17.104 --> 00:30:19.022
старомоден с обрат.

491
00:30:19.564 --> 00:30:22.109
И, хм, в него ще има малко череши.

492
00:30:22.192 --> 00:30:24.528
Много замислен.

493
00:30:46.883 --> 00:30:48.009
Наздраве.

494
00:30:49.344 --> 00:30:50.554
Наздраве.

495
00:30:55.058 --> 00:30:56.852
- Ммм. - Ммм?

496
00:30:57.436 --> 00:30:58.728
Това е много добро.

497
00:30:58.812 --> 00:31:00.021
- Да? - Ммм.

498
00:31:00.105 --> 00:31:02.149
Забелязвате ли някакви интересни вкусове?

499
00:31:02.732 --> 00:31:03.733
един...

500
00:31:07.612 --> 00:31:08.989
- Праскова? - Не.

501
00:31:09.156 --> 00:31:10.824
Близо, много близо.

502
00:31:11.074 --> 00:31:12.075
един...

503
00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:17.164
- Кайсия? - О.

504
00:31:18.874 --> 00:31:19.875
- Зубър?

505
00:31:19.958 --> 00:31:21.626
- Какво? майната му. - Толкова близо.

506
00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:23.837
Толкова близо. Хайде.

507
00:31:27.132 --> 00:31:28.341
Хмм

508
00:31:30.427 --> 00:31:32.429
- Нектарин? - Да!

509
00:31:32.554 --> 00:31:34.264
- Наистина ли? - Да, разбрахте.

510
00:31:37.309 --> 00:31:38.351
Нектарин.

511
00:31:41.146 --> 00:31:42.147
един...

512
00:31:43.857 --> 00:31:47.194
Вашата, ъъъ, къщата ви е плашеща.

513
00:31:48.361 --> 00:31:50.405
Всички вие сте като, знаете ли,

514
00:31:51.948 --> 00:31:56.036
изискани коктейли, а аз
съм като палачинки от торба.

515
00:31:57.245 --> 00:32:00.081
Да, но това ми харесва в теб.

516
00:32:00.790 --> 00:32:02.209
Без преструване.

517
00:32:04.127 --> 00:32:05.128
Хмм

518
00:32:08.423 --> 00:32:12.928
Между другото, това, хм... Къщата в Котидж Гроув,

519
00:32:13.011 --> 00:32:14.471
има хидромасажна вана.

520
00:32:14.554 --> 00:32:17.807
Не знам какво си опаковал
в тази твоя голяма чанта,

521
00:32:19.059 --> 00:32:20.644
но регулируеми джетове,

522
00:32:20.769 --> 00:32:23.063
множество светлини, цялото изпитание.

523
00:32:23.146 --> 00:32:25.273
Там ще е като на Нова година.

524
00:32:29.319 --> 00:32:30.820
Какво? Съжалявам.

525
00:32:32.489 --> 00:32:35.283
Ще ви трябва бански костюм.

526
00:32:38.203 --> 00:32:40.664
Ноа Ноа, погледни ме.

527
00:32:42.666 --> 00:32:44.584
Защо седиш толкова далеч?

528
00:32:46.503 --> 00:32:47.712
Ела тук.

529
00:34:47.374 --> 00:34:48.583
Хей.

530
00:34:48.875 --> 00:34:49.876
здравей

531
00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:53.296
Как СПА?

532
00:34:53.546 --> 00:34:56.633
Да, добре. хм...

533
00:34:58.343 --> 00:34:59.344
Какво...

534
00:35:00.553 --> 00:35:02.138
Какво стана?

535
00:35:06.309 --> 00:35:07.686
Дрогирах те.

536
00:35:26.746 --> 00:35:27.956
Какво, хм...

537
00:35:30.375 --> 00:35:32.877
Какво става, Стив?

538
00:35:35.839 --> 00:35:37.924
Ще ти кажа, но ще се побъркаш.

539
00:35:46.891 --> 00:35:49.060
Зубър. Не не не НЕ.

540
00:35:49.644 --> 00:35:51.771
Хмм хм...

541
00:35:53.148 --> 00:35:54.315
Ммм-ммм.

542
00:35:56.025 --> 00:35:58.695
Стив, можеш ли да ги свалиш, моля?

543
00:35:59.070 --> 00:36:00.488
Не мога да направя това.

544
00:36:02.949 --> 00:36:04.534
Можеш ли да ги свалиш?

545
00:36:05.118 --> 00:36:06.494
- Не мога да направя това. - Стив.

546
00:36:11.124 --> 00:36:12.542
Махни това.

547
00:36:14.878 --> 00:36:16.504
не мога да направя това.

548
00:36:22.677 --> 00:36:26.639
Не. Не, не, не, не,
не, не, не, не, не.

549
00:36:26.723 --> 00:36:28.892
Не не НЕ НЕ НЕ. Зубър.

550
00:36:28.975 --> 00:36:32.520
- Не. Не. Това не
се случва. - Да, случва се.

551
00:36:32.645 --> 00:36:34.105
Това не се случва. Това не се случва.

552
00:36:34.189 --> 00:36:35.190
Да, така е.

553
00:36:36.399 --> 00:36:39.277
Моля, моля, моля, моля. Това е шега.

554
00:36:40.236 --> 00:36:41.613
Нали, Стив?

555
00:36:41.738 --> 00:36:43.323
Виж, защо просто не опиташ да...

556
00:36:44.532 --> 00:36:45.867
- Ноа. - Недей! Недей! Недей!

557
00:36:45.950 --> 00:36:48.411
- Ще остана тук. -
Не се приближавай до мен.

558
00:36:49.579 --> 00:36:51.247
- Не се приближавай до
мен. - Аз оставам тук.

559
00:36:51.331 --> 00:36:53.625
Стив!

560
00:36:53.708 --> 00:36:56.544
Ноа

561
00:37:00.965 --> 00:37:03.718
Хайде, Ноа, помисли. Какво...

562
00:37:06.012 --> 00:37:08.139
Боже мой. Боже мой!

563
00:37:14.187 --> 00:37:15.188
Стив...

564
00:37:17.315 --> 00:37:18.942
ще ме изнасилиш ли

565
00:37:23.112 --> 00:37:24.656
Няма да те изнасилвам.

566
00:37:27.951 --> 00:37:30.662
Харесвам те, Ноа. Харесвам те.

567
00:37:31.788 --> 00:37:32.789
Добре?

568
00:37:32.872 --> 00:37:35.708
Сега искам да ме
изслушаш много внимателно, става ли?

569
00:37:36.626 --> 00:37:38.127
Слушаш ли ме?

570
00:37:38.211 --> 00:37:39.879
Ноа!

571
00:37:43.007 --> 00:37:44.133
Ето къде си.

572
00:37:47.262 --> 00:37:48.930
сега ще ти кажа.

573
00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:53.643
Ще продам месото ти.

574
00:37:56.104 --> 00:37:58.064
Хората ми плащат много пари за това.

575
00:37:58.314 --> 00:37:59.607
И косата ти.

576
00:37:59.774 --> 00:38:01.109
И такива странни глупости.

577
00:38:02.110 --> 00:38:03.319
Това е нещо.

578
00:38:03.862 --> 00:38:04.863
Така...

579
00:38:05.196 --> 00:38:07.448
Аз не... няма да те убия...

580
00:38:09.325 --> 00:38:10.493
...ами, веднага...

581
00:38:11.244 --> 00:38:13.788
Защото колкото по-прясно е месото, толкова по-добре.

582
00:38:13.913 --> 00:38:16.416
Така че ще те държа
жив толкова дълго, колкото мога.

583
00:38:18.835 --> 00:38:20.253
Освен ако не действате.

584
00:38:21.254 --> 00:38:23.631
Добре? Но слушай, дотогава,

585
00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:24.841
аз ще се грижа за теб.

586
00:38:24.924 --> 00:38:26.009
Ще ти готвя.

587
00:38:26.092 --> 00:38:27.260
Всъщност съм много добър готвач.

588
00:38:27.343 --> 00:38:28.469
Все още не го знаеш.

589
00:38:28.928 --> 00:38:32.181
Докато не се държиш, нищо лошо
не трябва да се случи, нали?

590
00:38:32.265 --> 00:38:34.142
И виж. Това не е лошо, нали?

591
00:38:34.267 --> 00:38:35.643
Между другото, погледнете залеза. Виж...

592
00:38:38.521 --> 00:38:39.856
Хей, хей, хей, хей...

593
00:38:39.939 --> 00:38:42.275
- Ела тук. Ела
тук. - Не! Не! Не!

594
00:38:44.819 --> 00:38:46.154
всичко е наред. всичко е наред.

595
00:38:46.237 --> 00:38:48.197
всичко е наред. всичко
е наред. всичко е наред.

596
00:38:48.364 --> 00:38:50.074
Не! Не!

597
00:39:03.546 --> 00:39:06.633
Бъди тих. Успокой се.

598
00:39:12.472 --> 00:39:13.890
Спри да бъдеш толкова драматичен.

599
00:39:16.434 --> 00:39:17.602
всичко е наред.

600
00:39:17.685 --> 00:39:18.811
всичко е наред.

601
00:39:21.731 --> 00:39:23.024
Ето.

602
00:39:38.873 --> 00:39:41.250
Здравей, къде си, по дяволите?

603
00:39:41.334 --> 00:39:43.169
Изплашваш ме.

604
00:39:43.711 --> 00:39:46.506
Call me or text me.

605
00:39:47.131 --> 00:39:48.967
And I wanna hear where he took you.

606
00:40:04.816 --> 00:40:06.025
Trippin'.

607
00:40:12.907 --> 00:40:16.452
Help me!

608
00:40:18.496 --> 00:40:19.998
He's not here.

609
00:40:21.332 --> 00:40:22.750
Help me!

610
00:40:23.126 --> 00:40:26.796
Help me, please! Please! Please, 
I'll do anything!

611
00:40:26.879 --> 00:40:29.257
I can't... I can't help you.

612
00:40:29.340 --> 00:40:30.842
We're in the same boat.

613
00:40:33.469 --> 00:40:34.721
Fuck!

614
00:40:39.976 --> 00:40:41.477
Tell me your name.

615
00:40:45.815 --> 00:40:47.025
Noa.

616
00:40:49.110 --> 00:40:50.445
I'm Penny.

617
00:40:51.487 --> 00:40:54.115
I was in town visiting.

618
00:40:55.491 --> 00:40:56.701
Met Steve.

619
00:40:59.662 --> 00:41:02.957
Now I'm slowly...

620
00:41:03.666 --> 00:41:05.209
being eaten.

621
00:41:06.711 --> 00:41:08.796
How long have you been here?

622
00:41:09.422 --> 00:41:11.007
I've lost track.

623
00:41:11.466 --> 00:41:15.094
I'm not even sure what time
of day it is, to be honest.

624
00:41:18.681 --> 00:41:21.017
People have to be looking for you.

625
00:41:21.225 --> 00:41:22.435
Your... Your...

626
00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:24.437
Your friends, your family, the police.

627
00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:26.481
People have to be searching by now.

628
00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:29.400
The problem is,

629
00:41:29.484 --> 00:41:31.611
I don't have much family.

630
00:41:33.279 --> 00:41:35.823
Me neither.

631
00:41:37.325 --> 00:41:38.826
Makes sense.

632
00:41:46.626 --> 00:41:48.127
Are there others?

633
00:41:50.171 --> 00:41:53.841
Just one other besides us, I think.

634
00:41:55.426 --> 00:41:57.804
Hey, Melissa, can you hear me?

635
00:42:06.521 --> 00:42:08.898
She's lost her mind.

636
00:42:09.982 --> 00:42:12.110
But I get it.

637
00:42:13.778 --> 00:42:15.363
No judgment here.

638
00:42:23.788 --> 00:42:25.665
We have to get out of here.

639
00:42:48.271 --> 00:42:49.355
Hmm...

640
00:43:00.158 --> 00:43:01.951
Motherfucking...

641
00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:15.756
Okay.

642
00:43:42.658 --> 00:43:43.826
Fuck.

643
00:46:17.772 --> 00:46:18.856
Hey.

644
00:46:19.273 --> 00:46:20.316
How are you?

645
00:46:23.486 --> 00:46:25.571
Still angry.

646
00:46:27.156 --> 00:46:28.783
At least try the cake.

647
00:46:29.867 --> 00:46:31.118
I need to shower.

648
00:46:38.459 --> 00:46:39.668
Alone?

649
00:46:41.712 --> 00:46:45.174
It's a joke. It was a stupid joke.

650
00:46:45.257 --> 00:46:47.259
I'm trying, you know? 
I'm trying to...

651
00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:49.720
I'm trying to make you
laugh and it's not working.

652
00:46:51.013 --> 00:46:53.224
Can't you just give me one smile, please?

653
00:46:53.808 --> 00:46:54.809
Just one?

654
00:47:00.898 --> 00:47:02.191
Is that a yes?

655
00:47:06.904 --> 00:47:08.030
Okay.

656
00:47:10.408 --> 00:47:11.742
God, I mean,

657
00:47:11.826 --> 00:47:14.036
you're gonna have to
loosen up a little bit.

658
00:47:14.203 --> 00:47:16.205
I know things are a little different,

659
00:47:17.248 --> 00:47:18.958
but it's still me, you know?

660
00:47:19.041 --> 00:47:20.584
Still the guy I was
at the bar that night.

661
00:47:20.709 --> 00:47:22.044
I meant everything I said to you.

662
00:47:22.336 --> 00:47:23.337
Just...

663
00:47:23.838 --> 00:47:27.007
no games, right? 
No projections?

664
00:47:27.216 --> 00:47:28.843
Isn't that what you wanted?

665
00:47:40.563 --> 00:47:42.189
Are you gonna be good?

666
00:49:04.355 --> 00:49:06.649
Bad girl.

667
00:49:37.972 --> 00:49:40.474
I don't wanna lose you

668
00:49:40.558 --> 00:49:44.061
I don't want you walking away

669
00:49:48.357 --> 00:49:49.900
We're so good together

670
00:49:49.984 --> 00:49:51.777
I can't move.

671
00:49:51.944 --> 00:49:53.153
I know.

672
00:49:53.654 --> 00:49:56.907
I gave you an epidural,
so you won't feel much.

673
00:49:58.576 --> 00:50:00.494
What are you doing?

674
00:50:01.370 --> 00:50:02.705
Hmm...

675
00:50:03.789 --> 00:50:05.124
I'm taking your ass.

676
00:50:07.710 --> 00:50:08.711
No.

677
00:50:08.794 --> 00:50:10.921
- Yes. 
- No.

678
00:50:11.005 --> 00:50:12.715
You lost my trust, Noa.

679
00:50:13.507 --> 00:50:15.968
So there are gonna have to be consequences.

680
00:50:16.260 --> 00:50:20.556
Don't leave me here with my restless heart

681
00:50:20.681 --> 00:50:23.350
Please.

682
00:50:23.475 --> 00:50:26.729
I'm cauterizing your ass so
you won't be a bloody mess.

683
00:50:26.812 --> 00:50:30.024
- Please stop. 
- Noa, it's gonna be okay.

684
00:50:30.232 --> 00:50:31.942
Hey, I'm a doctor, remember?

685
00:50:44.038 --> 00:50:45.205
Hey.

686
00:50:47.249 --> 00:50:48.250
Yo.

687
00:50:48.334 --> 00:50:49.918
Thanks for letting me stop by.

688
00:50:50.127 --> 00:50:53.213
Yeah, well, you didn't really
give me a choice, so...

689
00:50:53.297 --> 00:50:55.924
Boy, stop acting like
you didn't wanna see me.

690
00:50:56.008 --> 00:50:58.552
And I wanted to see your face again.

691
00:50:59.720 --> 00:51:01.513
- You wanted to see my face? 
- Yeah.

692
00:51:01.597 --> 00:51:02.681
You wanted to see my face.

693
00:51:02.765 --> 00:51:03.766
I did.

694
00:51:03.891 --> 00:51:06.810
Mollie, you ain't never gonna change. 
I still can't give you his info.

695
00:51:06.935 --> 00:51:08.479
If I even had it.

696
00:51:08.562 --> 00:51:09.980
Come on, please?

697
00:51:10.064 --> 00:51:12.191
It's the only connection
that I have right now.

698
00:51:12.358 --> 00:51:13.484
Why don't you just go to the police?

699
00:51:13.567 --> 00:51:14.693
- The police. 
- Yeah.

700
00:51:14.777 --> 00:51:15.986
And say what?

701
00:51:16.070 --> 00:51:17.988
That my best friend
went away with a guy

702
00:51:18.072 --> 00:51:20.032
and extended her trip and she's texting me,

703
00:51:20.115 --> 00:51:21.283
but I don't think it's her?

704
00:51:21.367 --> 00:51:22.951
Why not? She white, right?

705
00:51:23.035 --> 00:51:24.870
Don't do that.

706
00:51:25.329 --> 00:51:27.498
No, I'm playin', I'm
playin'. Listen, I get it.

707
00:51:27.623 --> 00:51:30.334
I get it. But I
could lose my job, Mollie.

708
00:51:30.501 --> 00:51:32.836
Look, she wouldn't just disappear like this, okay?

709
00:51:33.837 --> 00:51:35.339
Look, I can tell
you when they were here.

710
00:51:35.422 --> 00:51:36.423
Mollie.

711
00:51:36.507 --> 00:51:38.217
She told me that you were their bartender

712
00:51:38.342 --> 00:51:40.177
and he must have
used a credit card, right?

713
00:51:41.095 --> 00:51:43.889
Look, even just his last
name would be a huge help.

714
00:51:44.723 --> 00:51:45.933
Please?

715
00:51:46.934 --> 00:51:48.143
What are you doing?

716
00:51:48.268 --> 00:51:49.520
She's doing the pouty lip.

717
00:51:49.603 --> 00:51:51.230
Don't do the pouty lip. 
Don't do that.

718
00:51:51.355 --> 00:51:53.941
Just think about it. For me?

719
00:51:54.900 --> 00:51:56.110
I'll think about it.

720
00:51:56.235 --> 00:51:58.779
- Can we shake on it? 
- You remember that?

721
00:51:58.904 --> 00:52:00.614
- Do you remember it? 
- Do I...

722
00:52:00.698 --> 00:52:02.074
Shit.

723
00:52:02.825 --> 00:52:04.743
- Hey. 
- Get outta here.

724
00:52:05.869 --> 00:52:07.329
You lookin' good, by the way.

725
00:52:07.454 --> 00:52:08.455
- Me? 
- Mmm-hmm.

726
00:52:08.539 --> 00:52:09.707
- It's the beard. 
- Mmm.

727
00:52:09.790 --> 00:52:11.375
Yeah, it's connecting now.

728
00:52:11.500 --> 00:52:13.085
Got this new beard oil.

729
00:52:26.807 --> 00:52:28.100
Noa.

730
00:52:29.643 --> 00:52:31.019
How's your ass?

731
00:52:32.020 --> 00:52:33.147
Still gone.

732
00:52:33.897 --> 00:52:36.984
The pain meds are helping
me not care as much.

733
00:52:39.069 --> 00:52:42.489
He's so sweet, right?

734
00:52:46.660 --> 00:52:49.663
I just wanna hurt him, Penny.

735
00:52:51.373 --> 00:52:54.460
It's all I think about.

736
00:52:58.756 --> 00:53:00.924
I can't believe I slept with him.

737
00:53:01.383 --> 00:53:02.509
Wait,

738
00:53:02.676 --> 00:53:04.303
you fucked him?

739
00:53:05.763 --> 00:53:07.389
I never did.

740
00:53:09.349 --> 00:53:11.894
I don't think any
of the others did either.

741
00:53:12.936 --> 00:53:15.814
I am not slut-shaming you, by the way.

742
00:53:17.649 --> 00:53:19.568
I'd say it's a compliment.

743
00:53:20.652 --> 00:53:22.613
I'm so fucking stupid.

744
00:53:24.114 --> 00:53:27.034
No. You're not.

745
00:53:29.703 --> 00:53:33.540
It is not our fault, Noa.

746
00:53:39.213 --> 00:53:40.255
It's...

747
00:53:40.964 --> 00:53:42.216
always...

748
00:53:42.674 --> 00:53:43.926
theirs.

749
00:54:26.802 --> 00:54:29.555
What...

750
00:54:32.975 --> 00:54:33.976
The fuck?

751
00:55:14.600 --> 00:55:16.727
Get the fuck off me.

752
00:55:17.185 --> 00:55:18.186
Fuck.

753
00:55:55.599 --> 00:55:56.892
Wow, you did it.

754
00:55:57.059 --> 00:55:59.144
Mom, I made it!

755
00:56:21.833 --> 00:56:23.835
Extra cherries.

756
00:56:24.503 --> 00:56:25.796
You've earned it.

757
00:56:28.340 --> 00:56:30.342
Oh, fuck.

758
00:56:31.259 --> 00:56:32.636
I'm so tired.

759
00:56:33.595 --> 00:56:36.682
Woke up at 2:00 a.
m. last night going, "Really? Now?"

760
00:56:37.224 --> 00:56:39.476
I had to be up at 6:00.

761
00:56:39.643 --> 00:56:40.852
Then you know you're
not going back to sleep.

762
00:56:40.936 --> 00:56:43.689
You're up fuckin' three hours later. 
How are the meds?

763
00:56:45.565 --> 00:56:47.776
Great, great, great.

764
00:56:48.151 --> 00:56:49.319
Still in denial?

765
00:56:49.861 --> 00:56:52.197
Yeah. Well...

766
00:56:53.490 --> 00:56:55.993
Look, it's gonna take a little time,

767
00:56:56.576 --> 00:56:59.329
but eventually, you're gonna learn to accept

768
00:56:59.705 --> 00:57:03.250
that things don't always turn out
the way you thought they would.

769
00:57:03.959 --> 00:57:05.460
You know, we all die.

770
00:57:05.585 --> 00:57:07.713
But it's really just how
we decide to go out.

771
00:57:09.047 --> 00:57:10.924
Why did you sleep with me, Steve?

772
00:57:19.266 --> 00:57:20.892
I told you, I, um...

773
00:57:23.562 --> 00:57:25.022
I told you, I liked you.

774
00:57:27.691 --> 00:57:29.234
Anyway, it was a mistake.

775
00:57:34.823 --> 00:57:37.617
All right, try to relax.

776
00:57:38.493 --> 00:57:40.537
Fear and stress isn't good for the meat.

777
00:58:21.620 --> 00:58:22.621
Penny?

778
00:58:23.538 --> 00:58:26.792
Penny, please, just answer already.

779
00:58:30.462 --> 00:58:31.671
Please, Penny.

780
00:58:34.299 --> 00:58:35.300
Penny!

781
00:58:35.717 --> 00:58:36.927
What do you want?

782
00:58:37.094 --> 00:58:38.261
Oh, fuck.

783
00:58:39.679 --> 00:58:40.680
Jesus.

784
00:58:41.181 --> 00:58:43.141
Now, was that so hard?

785
00:58:46.186 --> 00:58:48.605
I'm done, Noa.

786
00:58:51.733 --> 00:58:53.110
No, you're not.

787
00:58:58.240 --> 00:59:00.867
I don't even know who I am anymore.

788
00:59:06.832 --> 00:59:09.793
I hope he fucking chokes.

789
00:59:12.212 --> 00:59:15.841
And then he gets a fucking tapeworm.

790
00:59:18.385 --> 00:59:21.638
And it just eats
him from the inside, slowly.

791
00:59:22.222 --> 00:59:25.308
And that all his weirdo friends

792
00:59:26.434 --> 00:59:30.772
shit and puke out of their eyes

793
00:59:32.315 --> 00:59:34.901
till they all fucking die.

794
00:59:39.447 --> 00:59:41.199
You're such a sweetheart, Penny.

795
00:59:46.496 --> 00:59:47.455
Just...

796
00:59:49.708 --> 00:59:51.001
stay strong.

797
00:59:52.043 --> 00:59:53.044
Okay?

798
00:59:55.088 --> 00:59:56.756
- I'll get you those nuts. 
- Thanks.

799
01:00:22.282 --> 01:00:23.325
Whatever you're selling,

800
01:00:23.408 --> 01:00:24.409
I'm not interested.

801
01:00:24.492 --> 01:00:27.245
Oh, no. I'm not selling anything. Sorry.

802
01:00:27.537 --> 01:00:29.748
My name is Mollie, and...

803
01:00:29.831 --> 01:00:31.124
Do I know you?

804
01:00:31.625 --> 01:00:32.626
No.

805
01:00:32.751 --> 01:00:34.961
But I'm looking for my friend, Noa,

806
01:00:35.045 --> 01:00:36.755
and I was hoping you could help me.

807
01:00:37.005 --> 01:00:39.216
I think your husband might know her.

808
01:00:39.299 --> 01:00:41.468
It really should only take a minute.

809
01:00:49.100 --> 01:00:51.519
You do realize how strange that sounds, right?

810
01:00:51.603 --> 01:00:53.647
Yes, I do, and, um...

811
01:00:54.105 --> 01:00:57.150
I don't really know how
to say this, but, um...

812
01:00:58.818 --> 01:01:01.404
I think she may
have been seeing your husband.

813
01:01:04.032 --> 01:01:05.533
What are you talking about?

814
01:01:14.793 --> 01:01:15.794
Hi.

815
01:01:18.338 --> 01:01:19.339
Hi.

816
01:01:28.223 --> 01:01:29.599
Do you need anything?

817
01:01:30.475 --> 01:01:31.851
No. Thank you.

818
01:01:35.188 --> 01:01:36.189
Okay.

819
01:01:40.443 --> 01:01:42.153
What does it taste like?

820
01:01:50.245 --> 01:01:51.246
Well...

821
01:01:53.373 --> 01:01:57.043
It depends on where it
comes from and how it's prepared.

822
01:02:00.505 --> 01:02:01.506
But...

823
01:02:06.928 --> 01:02:08.388
if it's done right...

824
01:02:12.267 --> 01:02:14.102
it's fucking exquisite.

825
01:02:16.062 --> 01:02:17.981
It's like nothing you've ever had before.

826
01:02:22.068 --> 01:02:23.069
Hmm.

827
01:02:33.371 --> 01:02:34.331
That's it?

828
01:02:58.104 --> 01:03:01.024
Go up to the playroom
while I make dinner, okay?

829
01:03:01.107 --> 01:03:03.526
Yeah! I got here first!

830
01:03:04.569 --> 01:03:05.820
Listen, um...

831
01:03:07.364 --> 01:03:10.825
I'm not even positive that's
my husband in the picture.

832
01:03:10.950 --> 01:03:13.078
You can't really see the face.

833
01:03:14.287 --> 01:03:17.582
Plus I saw him this morning
before he went to work, so...

834
01:03:19.959 --> 01:03:21.461
- Here. 
- Thanks.

835
01:03:21.544 --> 01:03:24.672
Honestly, this is... 
This is crazy.

836
01:03:26.966 --> 01:03:30.136
You should go to the police
if you're so worried about your friend.

837
01:03:31.721 --> 01:03:33.723
Um...

838
01:03:34.641 --> 01:03:36.142
Does he ever go out of town

839
01:03:36.267 --> 01:03:38.478
- for work or anything? 
- No.

840
01:03:38.561 --> 01:03:42.190
Well, they went away to
Cottage Grove, like, a week ago,

841
01:03:42.273 --> 01:03:46.069
and I haven't heard from
her since then and I'm just...

842
01:03:46.152 --> 01:03:47.779
I don't know where that is.

843
01:03:50.532 --> 01:03:52.951
- I'm just worried, okay? 
- Yeah, I understand.

844
01:03:54.744 --> 01:03:56.121
I'm really sorry.

845
01:03:57.122 --> 01:03:58.456
Um...

846
01:03:58.540 --> 01:04:01.918
That's my husband right now. 
You need to leave, okay?

847
01:04:02.001 --> 01:04:05.922
I'm just desperate. 
Woman-to-woman, maybe your husband has more information.

848
01:04:06.005 --> 01:04:08.216
I'm not trying to mess
anything up for anybody here.

849
01:04:08.299 --> 01:04:09.300
I'm just trying to find my friend.

850
01:04:09.384 --> 01:04:10.385
- Hey. 
- Hey.

851
01:04:12.262 --> 01:04:13.972
- Hello. Hi. 
- Hey.

852
01:04:18.351 --> 01:04:20.437
- What's going on? 
- Nothing.

853
01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:22.522
Nothing. This woman was just leaving.

854
01:04:23.523 --> 01:04:24.566
You're Steve, right?

855
01:04:24.941 --> 01:04:26.276
No, I'm Brendan.

856
01:04:26.526 --> 01:04:28.445
But you go by Steve, right?

857
01:04:29.070 --> 01:04:32.407
No. Just Brendan. Who are you?

858
01:04:33.366 --> 01:04:35.076
I'm Mollie. Um...

859
01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:39.497
My friend Noa, uh, 
I think you know her, she's missing.

860
01:04:39.956 --> 01:04:41.958
Noa. Um...

861
01:04:42.041 --> 01:04:44.377
No, I'm sorry, I... I don't.

862
01:04:44.461 --> 01:04:45.462
Um...

863
01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:47.964
- Do you, honey? 
- No, of course not.

864
01:04:48.465 --> 01:04:52.635
That's terrible. Yeah, I don't know, 
I think you have the wrong house.

865
01:04:55.763 --> 01:04:58.892
Yeah. Yeah, you're probably right.

866
01:05:00.310 --> 01:05:01.561
Okay.

867
01:05:01.811 --> 01:05:03.771
- I'm sorry. Sorry about that. 
- No.

868
01:05:03.855 --> 01:05:05.064
We're sorry we couldn't help you.

869
01:05:05.148 --> 01:05:06.733
Sorry about your friend.

870
01:05:10.695 --> 01:05:13.281
I'm just thinking, when's the
last time you saw her?

871
01:05:23.208 --> 01:05:24.501
Oh, it's you.

872
01:05:25.502 --> 01:05:27.587
Mollie, right?

873
01:05:29.422 --> 01:05:30.507
Really shouldn't have done that.

874
01:05:55.406 --> 01:05:56.574
Noa said we'd get along.

875
01:05:56.658 --> 01:05:57.659
Fuck!

876
01:06:02.705 --> 01:06:03.665
Let's see.

877
01:06:11.005 --> 01:06:12.006
So...

878
01:06:13.550 --> 01:06:15.677
why did you ask
me what it tasted like?

879
01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:21.015
Um...

880
01:06:21.349 --> 01:06:22.433
I don't know.

881
01:06:25.186 --> 01:06:28.189
I guess I was... curious.

882
01:06:29.774 --> 01:06:31.276
You were curious?

883
01:06:32.944 --> 01:06:34.487
You expect me to believe that?

884
01:06:37.073 --> 01:06:38.908
You can believe what you want.

885
01:06:44.747 --> 01:06:45.707
Okay.

886
01:06:52.005 --> 01:06:54.549
Let's have dinner and we'll
see how curious you are.

887
01:06:55.842 --> 01:06:58.970
Brought you some stuff. 
Figured you might wanna...

888
01:07:00.388 --> 01:07:01.472
change.

889
01:07:17.363 --> 01:07:18.448
Mmm.

890
01:07:35.840 --> 01:07:37.050
Fuck.

891
01:08:27.517 --> 01:08:29.727
The boys go down okay?

892
01:08:30.269 --> 01:08:32.855
Mmm-hmm. They asked for you.

893
01:08:46.452 --> 01:08:47.620
How was work?

894
01:08:47.787 --> 01:08:48.788
Good.

895
01:08:49.330 --> 01:08:52.208
Actually, I'm gonna be late tomorrow night.

896
01:08:53.251 --> 01:08:55.420
Lots to do now with the new product.

897
01:08:55.795 --> 01:08:58.339
Got some big clients expecting deliveries.

898
01:09:13.396 --> 01:09:14.939
I'm gonna take a shower.

899
01:09:15.106 --> 01:09:16.607
Good teamwork today.

900
01:12:57.411 --> 01:12:59.163
Don't worry, I'm not gonna drug you.

901
01:13:00.122 --> 01:13:01.165
Again.

902
01:13:02.416 --> 01:13:03.876
You better not.

903
01:13:07.505 --> 01:13:08.506
Cheers.

904
01:13:11.258 --> 01:13:12.259
Cheers.

905
01:13:19.934 --> 01:13:21.811
So you mentioned you were curious.

906
01:13:24.397 --> 01:13:25.398
Yeah.

907
01:13:25.564 --> 01:13:28.526
All right, what do you wanna know?

908
01:13:31.237 --> 01:13:32.238
Well...

909
01:13:34.407 --> 01:13:35.408
Um...

910
01:13:37.785 --> 01:13:39.662
When did you first try it?

911
01:13:39.787 --> 01:13:41.247
Um...

912
01:13:41.330 --> 01:13:44.667
I was, um, 18 or 19.

913
01:13:45.835 --> 01:13:47.461
Nineteen, yeah.

914
01:13:47.628 --> 01:13:48.879
And, look...

915
01:13:50.172 --> 01:13:52.717
it wasn't an overnight thing, you know?

916
01:13:52.842 --> 01:13:54.385
First, I was actually horrified.

917
01:13:54.468 --> 01:13:58.264
I mean, how could possibly be
capable of doing something like this?

918
01:13:58.347 --> 01:14:02.560
You know, I was a normal kid, I had friends, 
I had a normal life,

919
01:14:03.728 --> 01:14:06.272
and now I gotta deal with this thing

920
01:14:06.981 --> 01:14:09.650
that I couldn't share with anybody.

921
01:14:09.775 --> 01:14:10.901
And that killed me.

922
01:14:11.736 --> 01:14:13.863
But I couldn't stop thinking about it.

923
01:14:14.697 --> 01:14:18.200
I couldn't get the, um,
taste out of my mouth.

924
01:14:18.868 --> 01:14:20.077
The texture.

925
01:14:21.203 --> 01:14:24.707
I liked it. I liked
the way it made me feel.

926
01:14:25.666 --> 01:14:28.794
So I thought, "I gotta find out
if there's more out there," you know.

927
01:14:28.919 --> 01:14:32.048
"I can't possibly be the
only person that feels this way."

928
01:14:32.548 --> 01:14:34.467
And I wasn't.

929
01:14:35.384 --> 01:14:38.137
There's a whole community of
people that are devoted to this.

930
01:14:40.014 --> 01:14:44.477
And that's when my life started making sense.

931
01:14:46.395 --> 01:14:47.480
I mean, it's...

932
01:14:48.439 --> 01:14:51.233
It's a very powerful thing.

933
01:14:52.777 --> 01:14:55.488
This whole world, if
you only knew. It's, um...

934
01:14:58.240 --> 01:14:59.658
It's about giving.

935
01:15:01.744 --> 01:15:04.789
Giving yourself over to somebody.

936
01:15:06.207 --> 01:15:09.627
Becoming one with somebody else, forever.

937
01:15:11.003 --> 01:15:12.004
And that's...

938
01:15:13.964 --> 01:15:15.591
That's a beautiful thing.

939
01:15:18.010 --> 01:15:19.303
That's surrender.

940
01:15:20.930 --> 01:15:22.056
That's love.

941
01:15:30.481 --> 01:15:32.900
And how many people are in this community?

942
01:15:33.609 --> 01:15:34.693
Not many.

943
01:15:36.362 --> 01:15:38.155
The one percent of the one percent.

944
01:15:39.365 --> 01:15:42.284
You know, there's nothing
these people can't afford, right?

945
01:15:42.368 --> 01:15:44.203
They want the one thing

946
01:15:44.745 --> 01:15:46.539
that no one else has

947
01:15:47.289 --> 01:15:48.624
or can get.

948
01:15:49.834 --> 01:15:51.710
And that's where I come in.

949
01:15:53.629 --> 01:15:55.047
I can get it for them.

950
01:15:57.591 --> 01:15:59.718
I made a name for myself.

951
01:16:03.097 --> 01:16:04.932
Is it only women that you eat?

952
01:16:06.851 --> 01:16:07.852
Yeah.

953
01:16:09.436 --> 01:16:10.437
Why?

954
01:16:11.147 --> 01:16:13.149
That's where the market is.

955
01:16:14.233 --> 01:16:16.152
Plus, women just taste better.

956
01:16:18.195 --> 01:16:19.196
So...

957
01:16:22.199 --> 01:16:24.160
I cooked us something.

958
01:16:25.578 --> 01:16:27.288
If you're open to trying it.

959
01:16:33.043 --> 01:16:34.170
Is it...

960
01:16:36.338 --> 01:16:37.464
Is it me?

961
01:16:40.176 --> 01:16:41.218
No.

962
01:16:43.762 --> 01:16:45.598
We'll have a bite together.

963
01:17:42.112 --> 01:17:44.531
This meal is about $30,000.

964
01:17:46.617 --> 01:17:47.952
That's crazy.

965
01:17:48.577 --> 01:17:50.663
Be a lot more
if she was still alive.

966
01:17:51.538 --> 01:17:52.498
Hope.

967
01:17:54.166 --> 01:17:55.334
That was her name.

968
01:17:56.919 --> 01:17:57.920
Kinda funny.

969
01:17:59.588 --> 01:18:01.507
It's kinda funny.

970
01:18:02.091 --> 01:18:03.092
Stupid.

971
01:18:07.263 --> 01:18:09.181
It's not what I expected.

972
01:18:11.850 --> 01:18:12.851
It's, um...

973
01:18:15.354 --> 01:18:17.064
It's indescribable.

974
01:18:42.548 --> 01:18:43.924
Thank you, Steve.

975
01:18:45.259 --> 01:18:46.885
You're welcome, Noa.

976
01:18:51.473 --> 01:18:53.434
You know how I knew you were special?

977
01:18:56.979 --> 01:18:58.689
'Cause you're fucked up, too.

978
01:19:49.531 --> 01:19:51.241
All right. Let's go.

979
01:20:28.362 --> 01:20:29.363
Noa!

980
01:20:32.658 --> 01:20:33.867
Penny. Yeah?

981
01:20:34.535 --> 01:20:37.996
That definitely didn't sound like Melissa.

982
01:20:39.623 --> 01:20:40.624
Yeah.

983
01:20:41.417 --> 01:20:43.127
Sounds like someone new.

984
01:20:53.220 --> 01:20:56.014
You know, the other night,

985
01:20:56.849 --> 01:20:58.434
I was thinking

986
01:20:59.393 --> 01:21:02.146
about how nice

987
01:21:02.729 --> 01:21:04.731
it's been to talk to you.

988
01:21:06.650 --> 01:21:10.654
But then I was like,
what if you're not real...

989
01:21:12.364 --> 01:21:16.577
...and I'm just going crazy?

990
01:21:18.745 --> 01:21:20.205
Like Melissa.

991
01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:28.464
But I feel like if
I had an imaginary friend,

992
01:21:30.132 --> 01:21:32.134
I wouldn't name her Noa.

993
01:21:33.635 --> 01:21:35.012
It'd be, like...

994
01:21:36.221 --> 01:21:37.639
Sean Connery.

995
01:21:51.278 --> 01:21:53.155
I wish I could see you.

996
01:22:01.330 --> 01:22:02.623
Me, too.

997
01:22:11.840 --> 01:22:13.342
I have something for you.

998
01:22:16.470 --> 01:22:17.471
Go ahead.

999
01:22:18.722 --> 01:22:19.765
Open it.

1000
01:22:45.624 --> 01:22:47.042
Do you like it?

1001
01:22:51.255 --> 01:22:53.507
It's pink.

1002
01:22:55.425 --> 01:22:56.885
I love it.

1003
01:22:57.928 --> 01:22:58.929
Thank you.

1004
01:22:59.555 --> 01:23:01.974
Maybe you can wear it tonight and, uh,

1005
01:23:03.475 --> 01:23:05.227
we can have dinner again.

1006
01:23:07.396 --> 01:23:09.022
Yeah. Okay.

1007
01:23:12.693 --> 01:23:14.236
I'll pick you up at 7:00.

1008
01:23:16.572 --> 01:23:18.073
I have no idea what time it is.

1009
01:23:18.156 --> 01:23:19.157
I know.

1010
01:23:20.867 --> 01:23:21.868
Sure.

1011
01:23:32.004 --> 01:23:33.630
Maybe you can freshen up.

1012
01:25:10.018 --> 01:25:11.186
Well, hello.

1013
01:25:12.354 --> 01:25:13.355
Hi.

1014
01:25:28.203 --> 01:25:30.789
I see we've made
it to the dinner table.

1015
01:25:30.872 --> 01:25:33.333
Yes, we have.

1016
01:25:36.503 --> 01:25:37.796
Is, um...?

1017
01:25:38.588 --> 01:25:40.298
Is this a date, Steve?

1018
01:25:43.885 --> 01:25:45.095
Maybe it is.

1019
01:26:06.074 --> 01:26:07.492
- Ooh. 
- Well...

1020
01:26:08.660 --> 01:26:09.786
All right.

1021
01:26:11.246 --> 01:26:13.206
It's gonna be an interesting night.

1022
01:26:13.498 --> 01:26:14.666
Yeah.

1023
01:26:14.833 --> 01:26:15.834
It is.

1024
01:26:16.168 --> 01:26:17.544
Great.

1025
01:26:19.504 --> 01:26:20.797
Let's get drunk.

1026
01:26:22.048 --> 01:26:24.176
I was thinking about
what you said that night.

1027
01:26:24.259 --> 01:26:26.303
About growing up alone and all.

1028
01:26:27.763 --> 01:26:32.684
Made me realize nobody's
ever really cooked for you.

1029
01:26:33.977 --> 01:26:35.312
And that made me sad.

1030
01:26:37.522 --> 01:26:40.734
Everyone has to have
someone cook for them once.

1031
01:26:42.277 --> 01:26:43.278
Pate.

1032
01:26:43.820 --> 01:26:45.864
Liver.

1033
01:26:45.989 --> 01:26:47.574
And garlic and rosemary.

1034
01:26:58.710 --> 01:27:00.462
- Mmm. 
- Mmm.

1035
01:27:00.587 --> 01:27:02.380
I do taste the garlic.

1036
01:27:02.464 --> 01:27:05.008
Definitely. Whoa.

1037
01:27:05.133 --> 01:27:08.512
You can make it next time. 
Just the way you like it.

1038
01:27:15.519 --> 01:27:16.853
Who's this?

1039
01:27:19.147 --> 01:27:21.024
- This? 
- Mmm.

1040
01:27:24.694 --> 01:27:26.029
This is Melissa.

1041
01:27:32.577 --> 01:27:33.745
Melissa.

1042
01:27:41.169 --> 01:27:42.879
I mean, that's so boring.

1043
01:27:43.505 --> 01:27:44.923
Isn't it?

1044
01:27:45.882 --> 01:27:47.050
Like, she...

1045
01:27:49.177 --> 01:27:51.763
She tastes so, you know, decadent...

1046
01:27:52.180 --> 01:27:54.766
and her name's Melissa.

1047
01:27:55.308 --> 01:27:56.309
Well...

1048
01:27:57.936 --> 01:28:00.605
Thought you were gonna
say something, you know, like,

1049
01:28:01.857 --> 01:28:02.858
Joy.

1050
01:28:05.986 --> 01:28:07.779
Guess we finished all of Hope.

1051
01:28:07.863 --> 01:28:10.448
Oh, no, there's more Hope left.

1052
01:28:16.413 --> 01:28:20.500
Did Melissa ever get a candlelit dinner?

1053
01:28:42.272 --> 01:28:44.149
Welcome to my world.

1054
01:28:46.526 --> 01:28:48.612
The clients wanna feel closer to the women.

1055
01:28:51.615 --> 01:28:54.826
They become a part
of you in some way.

1056
01:29:01.458 --> 01:29:02.792
There's Melissa.

1057
01:29:04.461 --> 01:29:07.923
And no, she never had a candlelight dinner.

1058
01:29:26.066 --> 01:29:27.692
Where is my stuff?

1059
01:29:35.367 --> 01:29:37.077
With me, I guess.

1060
01:29:53.009 --> 01:29:54.427
All right, come on.

1061
01:29:55.220 --> 01:29:56.554
There's more to eat.

1062
01:30:01.685 --> 01:30:02.978
We never did make it

1063
01:30:03.061 --> 01:30:04.604
to Cottage Grove, did we?

1064
01:30:06.189 --> 01:30:07.399
That's too bad.

1065
01:30:10.485 --> 01:30:12.320
It's really serene out there.

1066
01:30:13.029 --> 01:30:16.199
Really makes me wanna hug a tree.

1067
01:30:17.325 --> 01:30:21.746
Anyway, who knows? 
Maybe we could still go.

1068
01:30:24.374 --> 01:30:27.335
Okay, so this is, uh,

1069
01:30:28.294 --> 01:30:29.337
breast meat.

1070
01:30:29.796 --> 01:30:33.008
And it's, um, it's really nice.

1071
01:30:33.216 --> 01:30:35.969
It's fatty and subtle.

1072
01:30:36.219 --> 01:30:37.345
I don't know.

1073
01:30:37.595 --> 01:30:39.431
It might even be familiar.

1074
01:30:42.350 --> 01:30:43.351
What?

1075
01:30:43.435 --> 01:30:44.936
- No, it's... 
- Is it...?

1076
01:30:45.020 --> 01:30:46.479
No, it's, uh...

1077
01:30:47.772 --> 01:30:49.149
It's just stupid.

1078
01:30:49.232 --> 01:30:51.359
- No, no, no, go ahead. 
- No, I can't.

1079
01:30:51.443 --> 01:30:52.444
Come on.

1080
01:30:53.153 --> 01:30:54.487
You gotta tell me.

1081
01:30:54.904 --> 01:30:56.614
No, it's just, um...

1082
01:30:57.657 --> 01:31:00.243
You saved the breast till last.

1083
01:31:08.084 --> 01:31:09.586
Oh, my God.

1084
01:31:09.669 --> 01:31:10.670
That was, um...

1085
01:31:11.212 --> 01:31:12.672
That's good.

1086
01:31:12.839 --> 01:31:16.926
This is really nice, Steve. You know?

1087
01:31:18.511 --> 01:31:23.266
You're right, no one has
ever cooked for me, so...

1088
01:31:24.184 --> 01:31:27.395
It's not quite how I pictured it,

1089
01:31:27.479 --> 01:31:29.981
but, you know, it's... It is nice.

1090
01:31:30.065 --> 01:31:31.066
Yeah.

1091
01:31:31.733 --> 01:31:33.777
She's got better tits than me.

1092
01:31:36.112 --> 01:31:37.572
You're not disagreeing?

1093
01:31:37.655 --> 01:31:40.784
- No, it's not... 
- Thanks, Steve.

1094
01:31:40.867 --> 01:31:42.786
- I wasn't saying that. 
- Thanks a lot, Steve.

1095
01:31:49.292 --> 01:31:50.543
What's...?

1096
01:31:59.886 --> 01:32:02.931
Um...

1097
01:32:10.188 --> 01:32:11.439
Sorry.

1098
01:32:12.315 --> 01:32:13.733
Sorry, it's just...

1099
01:32:16.236 --> 01:32:18.238
Um, it's just...

1100
01:32:20.323 --> 01:32:22.408
It is really nice.

1101
01:32:24.994 --> 01:32:25.995
And it's...

1102
01:32:27.330 --> 01:32:28.289
It's...

1103
01:32:28.873 --> 01:32:31.793
all just so confusing.

1104
01:32:35.046 --> 01:32:37.465
And I can't quite process...

1105
01:32:44.013 --> 01:32:45.765
...'cause I feel awful.

1106
01:32:50.478 --> 01:32:51.563
I feel...

1107
01:32:53.439 --> 01:32:54.774
awful.

1108
01:32:57.944 --> 01:32:58.945
'Cause...

1109
01:33:01.281 --> 01:33:03.658
'Cause I don't... 
I don't feel awful.

1110
01:33:08.705 --> 01:33:09.747
Fuck.

1111
01:33:09.914 --> 01:33:11.332
Hey, come here.

1112
01:33:13.042 --> 01:33:15.044
Noa.

1113
01:33:16.462 --> 01:33:17.463
Hey.

1114
01:33:19.174 --> 01:33:20.425
It's okay.

1115
01:33:23.428 --> 01:33:25.513
It's okay.

1116
01:33:35.440 --> 01:33:36.983
It's all gonna be okay.

1117
01:33:42.947 --> 01:33:44.657
You're just different.

1118
01:33:46.826 --> 01:33:49.954
And I knew it from
the moment I met you.

1119
01:34:22.278 --> 01:34:24.572
I forgot to handcuff you.

1120
01:34:26.282 --> 01:34:28.326
Yeah.

1121
01:34:30.119 --> 01:34:31.120
You did.

1122
01:34:37.335 --> 01:34:38.920
Do you wanna dance?

1123
01:34:46.970 --> 01:34:48.096
Yeah.

1124
01:34:52.642 --> 01:34:53.810
Yeah, I do.

1125
01:37:22.417 --> 01:37:23.876
Fuck!

1126
01:37:32.427 --> 01:37:33.803
You fuck!

1127
01:37:35.096 --> 01:37:36.389
Oh, God!

1128
01:37:42.770 --> 01:37:43.896
Come on, come on.

1129
01:37:46.399 --> 01:37:48.067
You fucking bitch.

1130
01:37:54.740 --> 01:37:56.909
Hurry.

1131
01:37:56.993 --> 01:38:00.121
Goddamn it, Noa!

1132
01:38:01.998 --> 01:38:04.375
You fucking bitch!

1133
01:38:04.459 --> 01:38:06.461
I'm gonna cut your heart out!

1134
01:38:11.591 --> 01:38:13.009
Oh, my God, Mollie.

1135
01:38:13.718 --> 01:38:16.220
Are you okay? Are you okay?

1136
01:38:17.138 --> 01:38:20.475
I'm so sorry. Hey,
come on, come on. Okay.

1137
01:38:20.641 --> 01:38:22.393
- Oh, fuck. 
- Give me your hand.

1138
01:38:22.560 --> 01:38:23.644
What is wrong with you?

1139
01:38:23.728 --> 01:38:25.938
I can't tell you
right now, but I will.

1140
01:38:26.105 --> 01:38:27.773
Put those on. I'll be right back!

1141
01:38:27.857 --> 01:38:28.858
Where are you going?

1142
01:38:31.736 --> 01:38:34.113
Penny? Oh, my God, Penny! Are you okay?

1143
01:38:34.238 --> 01:38:36.407
It's so good to finally
see you. Are you okay?

1144
01:38:36.532 --> 01:38:37.742
Mollie! Mollie!

1145
01:38:37.909 --> 01:38:39.202
- Noa? 
- Mollie, come help!

1146
01:38:39.368 --> 01:38:41.621
- Noa? Oh, my God. 
- Come on, we gotta go.

1147
01:38:49.670 --> 01:38:51.130
- Are you okay? 
- Mmm-hmm. Yes.

1148
01:38:51.214 --> 01:38:52.256
You good?

1149
01:39:00.056 --> 01:39:01.474
Oh, shit!

1150
01:39:01.599 --> 01:39:02.934
Oh, fuck.

1151
01:39:53.568 --> 01:39:55.570
Mollie. Mollie.

1152
01:40:00.575 --> 01:40:01.576
Mollie.

1153
01:40:08.666 --> 01:40:10.209
- Come here. 
- No. No!

1154
01:40:10.376 --> 01:40:12.169
Where do you think you're going, Noa, huh?

1155
01:40:12.253 --> 01:40:13.462
Where do you think you're going?

1156
01:40:13.629 --> 01:40:15.089
Think you're going somewhere?

1157
01:40:15.172 --> 01:40:16.549
You're not gonna fucking leave.

1158
01:40:18.509 --> 01:40:20.428
Fuck.

1159
01:40:43.576 --> 01:40:45.494
No!

1160
01:40:49.665 --> 01:40:51.792
We gotta get the fuck outta here.

1161
01:41:03.596 --> 01:41:04.764
Fuck.

1162
01:41:12.938 --> 01:41:15.608
Naw, son, this shit is creepy as fuck.

1163
01:41:16.859 --> 01:41:19.236
I must've taken a wrong turn back there.

1164
01:41:20.404 --> 01:41:22.531
This some bullshit.

1165
01:41:25.076 --> 01:41:26.243
Whoa.

1166
01:41:28.496 --> 01:41:29.955
Come on, Mollie.

1167
01:41:30.998 --> 01:41:32.416
Where you at?

1168
01:41:32.541 --> 01:41:34.001
How the fuck did he get you?

1169
01:41:34.168 --> 01:41:37.755
I was trying to find
you, but I found him.

1170
01:41:37.880 --> 01:41:39.340
I knew shit was off.

1171
01:41:39.590 --> 01:41:42.635
I'm so sorry. It's all my fault.

1172
01:41:42.802 --> 01:41:44.595
You guys are so cute.

1173
01:41:44.679 --> 01:41:46.722
Oh, fuck! Oh, shit.

1174
01:41:46.806 --> 01:41:48.599
- Are you okay? 
- Yeah, I'm okay.

1175
01:41:48.766 --> 01:41:51.143
We gotta get up. 
I'm gonna pick you up.

1176
01:41:56.607 --> 01:41:57.942
Noa!

1177
01:41:58.526 --> 01:41:59.777
Oh, fuck.

1178
01:41:59.860 --> 01:42:01.779
Oh, this fucking guy!

1179

Noa!

1181
01:42:10.996 --> 01:42:12.873
You lied to me!

1182
01:42:14.750 --> 01:42:17.378
I'm gonna kill all you fucking bitches!

1183
01:42:17.962 --> 01:42:19.964
Watch out! He has a gun!

1184
01:42:22.299 --> 01:42:24.593
Naw, fuck this shit.

1185
01:42:25.386 --> 01:42:28.180
We gotta split up. 
We gotta zigzag.

1186
01:42:29.223 --> 01:42:31.475
Fuck.

1187
01:42:34.687 --> 01:42:36.105
Come on, man, we seen this movie.

1188
01:42:36.188 --> 01:42:38.607
We don't make it out
this bitch alive, you know this.

1189
01:42:39.400 --> 01:42:41.444
GPS got me twisted and shit.

1190
01:42:41.777 --> 01:42:44.280
Noa!

1191
01:42:44.447 --> 01:42:46.031
I'm sorry!

1192
01:42:46.824 --> 01:42:49.952
Okay? I'm sorry!

1193
01:42:51.078 --> 01:42:52.329
I'm sorry.

1194
01:42:53.289 --> 01:42:56.208
Is that what you want me to say?

1195
01:42:57.209 --> 01:42:58.419
Huh?

1196
01:43:15.895 --> 01:43:17.480
Get a flashlight.

1197
01:43:42.755 --> 01:43:45.090
Go ahead, you keep on fucking hiding.

1198
01:43:45.174 --> 01:43:46.675
You keep on fucking hiding!

1199
01:43:49.970 --> 01:43:53.933
Stupid fucking weak

1201
01:43:58.437 --> 01:44:00.147
That's what you are.

1202
01:44:00.981 --> 01:44:02.650
Fucking bitches.

1203
01:44:18.290 --> 01:44:19.667
Come on!

Give me a smile.

1209
01:45:05.629 --> 01:45:07.548
Fuck.

1210
01:45:16.599 --> 01:45:19.143
We did it, okay? We're safe.

1211
01:45:21.478 --> 01:45:23.230
Penny, are you okay?

1212
01:45:29.320 --> 01:45:30.321
Fuck!

1213
01:45:30.654 --> 01:45:31.655
Fuck!

1214
01:45:32.907 --> 01:45:34.575
I don't have any signal.

1215
01:45:35.367 --> 01:45:36.827
Oh, shit.

1216
01:45:37.244 --> 01:45:39.246
I left my phone.

1217
01:45:40.039 --> 01:45:42.166
- Okay, you stay with Penny. 
- What?

1218
01:45:42.875 --> 01:45:45.794
- You goin' back out there? 
- I gotta get my phone.

1219
01:45:46.337 --> 01:45:48.505
Look, come right the fuck back, okay?

1220
01:45:48.589 --> 01:45:49.590
Okay.

1221
01:45:49.757 --> 01:45:51.508

1222
01:45:53.260 --> 01:45:54.470
Come here.

1223
01:46:24.208 --> 01:46:25.417
Hmm.

1224
01:46:30.255 --> 01:46:32.091
We need to clean this up.

1225
01:46:33.217 --> 01:46:34.635
Yes, ma'am.

1226
01:46:34.802 --> 01:46:36.553
Let's get his body on ice.

1227
01:46:36.637 --> 01:46:37.888
Yes, ma'am.

1228
01:46:49.733 --> 01:46:51.568
Come on, come on.

1229
01:46:55.990 --> 01:46:57.783
Yes. Yes.

1230
01:47:05.499 --> 01:47:08.168
- Oh, my God, you got him. 
- What?

1231
01:47:08.293 --> 01:47:10.295
I thought this would never end.

1232
01:47:10.379 --> 01:47:11.380
You got him.

1233
01:47:11.547 --> 01:47:12.589
Who are you?

1234
01:47:12.673 --> 01:47:14.800
Thank you. We're free now, right?

1235
01:47:15.009 --> 01:47:18.262
- What? 
- Thank you. Thank you.

1236
01:47:22.016 --> 01:47:23.017
Anything?

1237
01:47:23.600 --> 01:47:24.601
Nothing.

1238
01:47:24.935 --> 01:47:26.103
Oh, fuck.

1239
01:47:33.402 --> 01:47:35.070
What the hell is that?

1240
01:47:51.462 --> 01:47:54.548
I wanna watch your life slip away.

1241
01:48:08.270 --> 01:48:10.064
You fucking cunt!

1242
01:48:11.482 --> 01:48:14.485
Mollie! Mollie!

1243
01:48:18.405 --> 01:48:21.283
I asked you for help!

1244
01:48:23.368 --> 01:48:27.539
Bitches like you are the fucking problem!

1245
01:48:44.515 --> 01:48:45.599
Who the...

1246
01:48:46.850 --> 01:48:48.602
Who the hell is that?

1247
01:48:50.771 --> 01:48:51.939
Steve's wife.

1248
01:48:54.775 --> 01:48:55.943
What?

1249
01:48:59.446 --> 01:49:00.781
He's married?

1250
01:49:03.700 --> 01:49:05.327
Was... Was married.

1251
01:49:13.502 --> 01:49:15.504
I fucking love you, Mollie.

1252
01:49:16.338 --> 01:49:17.756
I love you more.
