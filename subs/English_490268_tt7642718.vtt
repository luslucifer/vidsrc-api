Anyway, back to work typing up
your fabulous Christmas lists.


27
00:01:29.645 --> 00:01:31.230
Well, hello, Chicken.

28
00:01:31.271 --> 00:01:33.816
What can Santa get you
and your egg for Christmas?


29
00:01:33.857 --> 00:01:36.026
His name is Chico.

30
00:01:36.068 --> 00:01:38.654
Happy Chico.

31
00:01:38.696 --> 00:01:40.280
Happy Chico. Ha, love that.

32
00:01:40.322 --> 00:01:41.907
Why don't we start with you?

33
00:01:41.949 --> 00:01:44.660
Dear Santa...

34
00:01:44.702 --> 00:01:48.622
I... would like...

35
00:01:48.664 --> 00:01:51.000
a robot butler who does
everything I don't want to do


36
00:01:51.041 --> 00:01:52.626
but has a special computer chip

37
00:01:52.668 --> 00:01:53.919
which won't let him
turn against me,


38
00:01:53.961 --> 00:01:56.046
seeking robot-butler revenge!

39
00:01:56.088 --> 00:01:58.340
-(typewriter bell dings)
-Next.


40
00:01:58.382 --> 00:02:00.342
(laughing):
Oh!


41
00:02:00.384 --> 00:02:02.761
Merry Christmas, Goat.

42
00:02:02.803 --> 00:02:03.971
Uh-oh.

43
00:02:04.013 --> 00:02:05.806
You're under the mistletoe.

44
00:02:05.848 --> 00:02:08.100
(giggles)
Now you have to kiss me.


45
00:02:08.142 --> 00:02:10.144
(exhales)

46
00:02:14.398 --> 00:02:17.359
A red velvet robe,
red velvet slippers,


47
00:02:17.401 --> 00:02:19.236
red velvet jacket, you know,

48
00:02:19.278 --> 00:02:22.156
just say
"red velvet everything."


49
00:02:22.197 --> 00:02:24.116
Oh, and a hot tub.

50
00:02:24.158 --> 00:02:26.535
(chuckles)
Mm-hmm.


51
00:02:26.577 --> 00:02:29.163
You must have been
a very good duck this year


52
00:02:29.204 --> 00:02:31.582
to ask for so many presents.

53
00:02:31.623 --> 00:02:34.001
Yeah, just ask my assistant.

54
00:02:34.043 --> 00:02:36.962
He's been adding up my naughties
and nices this year.


55
00:02:37.004 --> 00:02:41.008
And I got to tell you,
things are looking good.


56
00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.217
Ain't that right, Rabbit?

57
00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:43.969
Rabbit?

58
00:02:44.011 --> 00:02:46.847
I kind of need to get back
to my Santa list here, buddy.


59
00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:48.891
Sir, you're...

60
00:02:48.932 --> 00:02:52.603
you're not getting
any presents this year.


61
00:02:52.644 --> 00:02:53.812
Wait, what?

62
00:02:53.854 --> 00:02:56.190
I just quintuple-checked
your numbers, sir.


63
00:02:56.231 --> 00:02:58.317
Uh, you have done
some nice things this year, yes,


64
00:02:58.358 --> 00:03:01.528
but you've also done
some terrible, awful,


65
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.573
just unspeakable things.

66
00:03:04.615 --> 00:03:05.866
Who, me?

67
00:03:05.908 --> 00:03:07.326
Roll the video.

68
00:03:13.874 --> 00:03:15.375
You pranked Farmer Brown

69
00:03:15.417 --> 00:03:17.878
by turning his
Statue of Liberty corn maze


70
00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.380
-into a Statue of Duck
corn maze. -What?


71
00:03:20.422 --> 00:03:21.882
(Duck laughs)

72
00:03:21.924 --> 00:03:24.218
Aw, oh... I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

73
00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:25.636
That was wrong.
(chuckles)


74
00:03:25.677 --> 00:03:28.180
RABBIT:
While Farmer Brown slept,


75
00:03:28.222 --> 00:03:30.474
you stacked 15 household
objects on his chest


76
00:03:30.516 --> 00:03:33.352
-(Farmer Brown grunts)
-with tragic results.


77
00:03:33.393 --> 00:03:36.355
Hey, I was going
for the world record.


78
00:03:36.396 --> 00:03:39.358
RABBIT: And you led the animals
on a protest strike


79
00:03:39.399 --> 00:03:42.778
because Farmer Brown wouldn't
buy you electric blankets.


80
00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.614
...no eggs.
No electric blankets, no milk!


81
00:03:45.656 --> 00:03:48.659
Uh, no comment.

82
00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.911
All right, I get it.

83
00:03:50.953 --> 00:03:54.039
All I'm getting for Christmas
is a big, fat lump of coal.


84
00:03:54.081 --> 00:03:55.624
I get it, okay?

85
00:03:55.666 --> 00:03:57.960
(groans)

86
00:03:58.001 --> 00:04:00.671
FARMER BROWN:
Well, hello, Cow,


87
00:04:00.712 --> 00:04:02.381
Cow, Cow,

88
00:04:02.422 --> 00:04:06.260
Sheep, Sheep, Sheep, Sheep,

89
00:04:06.301 --> 00:04:07.886
Chicken, Chicken,

90
00:04:07.928 --> 00:04:11.140
Chicken, Chicken, Chicken,

91
00:04:11.181 --> 00:04:12.349
Goat,

92
00:04:12.391 --> 00:04:14.768
Mouse, Mouse, Mouse,

93
00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.395
Duck, Rabbit,

94
00:04:16.436 --> 00:04:18.647
and, uh, well, 
Pig, of course.

95
00:04:18.689 --> 00:04:20.774
You writing your letters
to Santa, are you?


96
00:04:20.816 --> 00:04:23.819
(laughs):
Oh, that's what I like to see.


97
00:04:23.861 --> 00:04:26.613
"Can we type up
your Christmas list?"


98
00:04:26.655 --> 00:04:28.448
Oh, don't you worry about me.

99
00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:30.242
I got everything I need.

100
00:04:30.284 --> 00:04:32.870
Besides, Santa's gonna need
extra room in his sled


101
00:04:32.911 --> 00:04:34.872
for all your goodies.

102
00:04:34.913 --> 00:04:36.874
(crying)

103
00:04:36.915 --> 00:04:38.709
(blows nose)

104
00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.127
Oh, cheer up, Duck.

105
00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:42.546
So you're a selfish,
rotten fink.


106
00:04:42.588 --> 00:04:43.672
Big deal.

107
00:04:43.714 --> 00:04:45.257
(laughs)
Mwah, mwah, mwah.


108
00:04:45.299 --> 00:04:48.385
Not everyone can be
as wonderful as me.


109
00:04:48.427 --> 00:04:50.179
-(laughs)
-SHEEP: Be...


110
00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.349
ha... appy!

111
00:04:54.391 --> 00:04:56.018
(grunting)

112
00:04:56.059 --> 00:05:00.230
And know that we love you,
sweet prince.


113
00:05:00.272 --> 00:05:03.275
If this doesn't cheer you up,
nothing will.


114
00:05:03.317 --> 00:05:04.818
Ready, everybody?

115
00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.321
One, two, three.

116
00:05:07.362 --> 00:05:10.199
Group snow angel!

117
00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.201

(groans)

00:05:16.914 --> 00:05:18.081
Uh, sir? Are...

121
00:05:18.123 --> 00:05:20.792
Sir, uh, are you okay?

122
00:05:20.834 --> 00:05:22.794
(groans)

123
00:05:22.836 --> 00:05:27.007
I know you feel bad about not
getting any presents, sir.


124
00:05:27.049 --> 00:05:30.594
Uh, the good news is, Christmas
is about giving, not getting.


125
00:05:30.636 --> 00:05:31.803
R
-Right, sir?

126
00:05:31.845 --> 00:05:33.555
(moaning):
No.


127
00:05:33.597 --> 00:05:35.390
Hurry on in here, animals.

128
00:05:35.432 --> 00:05:37.309
The show is about to start.

129
00:05:37.351 --> 00:05:38.769
Ooh, this is gonna be
so excit...


130
00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:40.020
-No pushing!
-Ow! Hey! That's my seat.


131
00:05:40.062 --> 00:05:41.772
-Personal space. Hello?
-Come on! Really?


132
00:05:41.813 --> 00:05:45.108
-Ow! That's my hoof!
-All right, all right.


133
00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:46.610
Watch out for extremely
breakable Chico.


134
00:05:46.652 --> 00:05:48.362
(chuckles)
All right, now.


135
00:05:48.403 --> 00:05:50.280
Now, get ready.

136
00:05:50.322 --> 00:05:53.700
It's almost time for the first
Christmas special of Christmas.


137
00:05:53.742 --> 00:05:56.078
There we go-- oh.

138
00:05:56.119 --> 00:05:58.247
What the...? Oh.

139
00:05:58.288 --> 00:06:00.249
Oh, crab apples.

140
00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:01.917
Not again.

141
00:06:01.959 --> 00:06:03.710
-(snorting)
-All right, now.


142
00:06:03.752 --> 00:06:04.920
Oh...

143
00:06:04.962 --> 00:06:08.131
Now, where does
all that money go?


144
00:06:08.173 --> 00:06:10.259
It's like a bottomless pit
down there.


145
00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:11.635
Ah, no matter.

146
00:06:11.677 --> 00:06:13.720
Hey, what's a little
loose change


147
00:06:13.762 --> 00:06:15.681

00:13:25.735 --> 00:13:28.947
Adventure Tour.

323
00:13:28.988 --> 00:13:31.032
If we're very, very lucky--

324
00:13:31.074 --> 00:13:33.326
extremely lucky,
some might say--


325
00:13:33.368 --> 00:13:36.579
we just might spot some cows
over here.


326
00:13:36.621 --> 00:13:40.959
I udder to think
what might happen


327
00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.086
if there was a milk misfire.

328
00:13:43.128 --> 00:13:45.296
-Oopsies.
-DUCK: Uh-oh.


329
00:13:45.338 --> 00:13:47.173
Incoming! Let's get out of here.

330
00:13:47.215 --> 00:13:49.134
(both laughing)

331
00:13:49.175 --> 00:13:51.052
You may have seen a flock
of sheep before,


332
00:13:51.094 --> 00:13:52.929
but have you ever seen
a clump of sheep?


333
00:13:52.971 --> 00:13:54.347
They're one of nature's

334
00:13:54.389 --> 00:13:57.642
most graceful,
majestical animal clumps.


335
00:13:57.684 --> 00:13:59.978
(all groaning)

336
00:14:00.019 --> 00:14:00.979
Ooh!

337
00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:03.273
Ah, well, uh,

338
00:14:03.314 --> 00:14:05.150
if you like the sweaters,

339
00:14:05.191 --> 00:14:07.777
they're available
in our souvenir shop.


340
00:14:07.819 --> 00:14:10.864
They make a great gift for Dad.

341
00:14:10.905 --> 00:14:13.992
Another fun fact--
scientists have discovered


342
00:14:14.033 --> 00:14:17.287
that birds are the direct
descendants of dinosaurs.


343
00:14:17.328 --> 00:14:20.206
Is it true? You'll have
to decide for yourself.


344
00:14:20.248 --> 00:14:21.666
(clucking and bellowing)

345
00:14:21.708 --> 00:14:24.711
Oh, no! If you want to live,
follow me, guys!


346
00:14:24.753 --> 00:14:26.588
(bellowing and screeching)

347
00:14:26.629 --> 00:14:29.007
(wind whistling)

348
00:14:30.175 --> 00:14:33.011
And that's... that's a goat.

349
00:14:33.052 --> 00:14:35.555
I'm a goat.

350
00:14:35.597 --> 00:14:37.140
(door creaks open)

351
00:14:37.182 --> 00:14:38.725
All right, then.

352
00:14:38.767 --> 00:14:40.935
If you're a child,
hold your parent's paw,


353
00:14:40.977 --> 00:14:43.188
talon or hoof a little tighter.

354
00:14:43.229 --> 00:14:46.399
(whispering): Because
if we're really, really lucky,


355
00:14:46.441 --> 00:14:50.445
we might get a glimpse of the
most terrifying animal of all.


356
00:14:50.487 --> 00:14:54.032
Look... if you dare.

357
00:14:54.073 --> 00:14:56.075
(snoring)

358
00:14:56.117 --> 00:14:59.120
-(groaning) -You may touch,
but do not awaken the beast,


359
00:14:59.162 --> 00:15:03.249
-because that would be a very,
very, very bad idea. -(snoring)


360
00:15:03.291 --> 00:15:05.043
-(air horn blows)
-Aah!


361
00:15:05.084 --> 00:15:07.837
Ooh, what's going on here?
What...?


362
00:15:07.879 --> 00:15:10.048
Duck? Ooh, I should've known!

363
00:15:10.089 --> 00:15:11.966
What do you think you're doing?

364
00:15:12.008 --> 00:15:14.135
-(Duck hums "Rock-a-Bye Baby")
-(mutters)


365
00:15:14.177 --> 00:15:16.971
-It's all a dream?
-Sleep.


366
00:15:17.013 --> 00:15:19.349
Well, I reckon that's a relief.

367
00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:21.351
-It's all a dream.
-Sleep.


368
00:15:21.392 --> 00:15:23.895
(snoring)

369
00:15:23.937 --> 00:15:25.396
(wind whistling)

370
00:15:25.438 --> 00:15:27.524
Why is everybody
so stressed out?


371
00:15:27.565 --> 00:15:29.025
We're only halfway there.

372
00:15:29.067 --> 00:15:31.110
And Christmas is a week away?

373
00:15:31.152 --> 00:15:32.821
(gasps)
I've got an idea.


374
00:15:32.862 --> 00:15:34.239
I don't know, Cow.

375
00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:35.824
Your ideas have a way of...

376
00:15:35.865 --> 00:15:37.492
Kind of always...

377
00:15:37.534 --> 00:15:40.453
-Stinking?
-Hey!


378
00:15:40.495 --> 00:15:43.706
Great idea, Cow!

379
00:15:43.748 --> 00:15:46.376
Definitely not stinky. (laughs)

380
00:15:46.417 --> 00:15:48.545
Cow-ow-ow-ow-ow!

381
00:15:48.586 --> 00:15:53.132
Oh, well, when in doubt,
you got to go bouncy house.


382
00:15:53.174 --> 00:15:55.385
(laughs)
Cannonballs!

That's very nice

Well, that's because

00:17:24.307 --> 00:17:26.601
just text your order
directly to me.

coming, Al!

everybody's dreaming

Oop. Embarrassing.

426
00:17:42.617 --> 00:17:46.204
So come on down and get your
Tumbletron while supplies last.


427
00:17:46.245 --> 00:17:48.289
They're going fast!

428
00:17:48.331 --> 00:17:50.500
Wait a second.
They're going fast?


429

SHEEP:
While supplies last?


430
00:17:52.502 --> 00:17:54.295
Oh, no.
We don't have the money yet.


431
00:17:54.337 --> 00:17:57.632
We have got to do something
before they're all gone.

You're so brave.

435
00:18:04.889 --> 00:18:06.808
If we're going
to get that dryer,


436
00:18:06.849 --> 00:18:09.352
we must be fearless,
we must be cunning.


437
00:18:10.937 --> 00:18:14.273
And we must make
the customers disappear.


438

On my count, my compadres.

439

here, but I-I run a business,

problems competing

you leave right now,

Al's got a lot more customers.

what if we helped her out...


479
00:20:07.303 --> 00:20:09.305
and got paid for it?

00:20:10.681 --> 00:20:13.059
(singsongy):
Who's excited?


481
00:20:13.101 --> 00:20:14.852
I sure am!

482
00:20:14.894 --> 00:20:20.525
We're almost ready for the
Stupendous Flying Animal Santas!


483
00:20:20.566 --> 00:20:23.611
Stupendous Flying Animal Santas?

484
00:20:23.653 --> 00:20:25.238
Yeah, they gave me
this brochure.


485
00:20:25.279 --> 00:20:27.031
Okay, it says
they know the secret


486
00:20:27.073 --> 00:20:28.741
to attracting new customers.

487
00:20:28.783 --> 00:20:30.326
Oh, I sure hope so.

488
00:20:30.368 --> 00:20:33.204
(stammering):
Is everybody ready?


489
00:20:33.246 --> 00:20:37.375
Then bring on the stupendiosity!

490
00:20:37.416 --> 00:20:40.086
Oh, please, please,
please, please, please, please!


491
00:20:45.842 --> 00:20:49.345
Cow, buddy, hey,
skydiving isn't that scary.


492
00:20:49.387 --> 00:20:51.430
Remember what they said
in the safety video?


493
00:20:51.472 --> 00:20:54.350
It's like dancing in the air!

494
00:20:54.392 --> 00:20:56.602
♪ Dancing in the air,
sweetheart. ♪


495
00:20:56.644 --> 00:20:59.105
Come on, Cow, dance with me.

496
00:20:59.147 --> 00:21:01.399
Uh, I need some help.

497
00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:04.068
Hip! Hop! Hoo-ha!
Heechy, hoo-ha-ha!


498
00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:05.820
Whatever it is you guys say.

499
00:21:05.862 --> 00:21:07.613
Okay, never mind.

500
00:21:07.655 --> 00:21:09.240
-Pig... baby.
-(whimpering)


501
00:21:09.282 --> 00:21:11.409
Who's ready to be a legend?
Come on. Show of hooves!


502
00:21:11.450 --> 00:21:13.411
(crying):
No, no.


503
00:21:13.452 --> 00:21:15.204
Come on, Sheep Clump,
talk to me.


504
00:21:15.246 --> 00:21:16.956
Tell me what I want to hear.

505
00:21:16.998 --> 00:21:19.917
-(whimpering) -We... -Want...
-Our... -Mommies!


506
00:21:19.959 --> 00:21:22.128
Come on.
What is your deal, guys?


507
00:21:22.170 --> 00:21:23.963
If we make this jump,

508
00:21:24.005 --> 00:21:26.507
Brigitte's going to pay us
enough money to buy the dryer.


509
00:21:26.549 --> 00:21:28.843
If we don't, we won't get squat.

510
00:21:28.885 --> 00:21:32.346
Look, guys,
I'm just as scared as you are,


511
00:21:32.388 --> 00:21:35.224
but you know what's even scarier
than this?


512
00:21:35.266 --> 00:21:37.852
Not getting that dryer
for Farmer Brown.


513
00:21:37.894 --> 00:21:40.188
I know what you're all thinking.

514
00:21:40.229 --> 00:21:42.190
"Farm animals don't fly."

515
00:21:42.231 --> 00:21:45.735
They fall at a rate of 32.2 feet
per second per second, sir.


516
00:21:45.776 --> 00:21:47.445
Maybe they do, Rabbit!

517
00:21:47.486 --> 00:21:49.071
Maybe they do.

518
00:21:49.113 --> 00:21:50.615
But guess what.

519
00:21:50.656 --> 00:21:52.325
You're not farm animals today.

520
00:21:52.366 --> 00:21:55.870
You're farm animals
wearing rented Santa suits.


521
00:21:55.912 --> 00:21:59.415
So ask yourself:
what would Santa do?


522
00:21:59.457 --> 00:22:03.169
Would he cry like a baby
or draw a scared face on an egg?


523
00:22:03.211 --> 00:22:05.880
No. He'd tighten his belt
and say,


524
00:22:05.922 --> 00:22:08.049
"Santa Claus is coming to town!"

525
00:22:08.090 --> 00:22:10.009
-Yes. -Yeah.
-Well, that's probably true.


526
00:22:10.051 --> 00:22:11.969
(overlapping chatter)

527
00:22:12.011 --> 00:22:14.388
Cows, make me proud!

528
00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:16.849
COWS:
Santa Claus is coming to town!


529
00:22:16.891 --> 00:22:19.101
Chickens,
I know you're not chicken.


530
00:22:19.143 --> 00:22:21.187
CHICKENS:
Santa Claus is coming to town!


531
00:22:21.229 --> 00:22:23.356
Hey, mice,
you eat danger for breakfast!


532
00:22:23.397 --> 00:22:25.316
MICE:
Santa Claus is coming to town!


533
00:22:25.358 --> 00:22:27.235
Is everybody ready?

534
00:22:27.276 --> 00:22:28.611
ALL:
Yeah!


535
00:22:28.653 --> 00:22:32.490
Then... ho, ho...

536
00:22:32.531 --> 00:22:33.991
go!

537
00:22:34.033 --> 00:22:37.245
ALL:
Go!


538
00:22:37.286 --> 00:22:39.664
All we got to do is
hit that bull's-eye,


539
00:22:39.705 --> 00:22:41.249
and we bring home the bacon.

540
00:22:41.290 --> 00:22:45.294
Just follow me down!
I'll lead the way!


541
00:22:46.545 --> 00:22:49.423
Duck, look--
I'm dancing in the air!


542
00:22:49.465 --> 00:22:51.217
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh.
(laughs)


543
00:22:51.259 --> 00:22:53.177
Yes, you are, Cow.

544
00:22:53.219 --> 00:22:55.388
Ready for action, my friends?

545
00:22:55.429 --> 00:22:56.764
(mice grunting)

546
00:22:56.806 --> 00:22:58.015
Ho!

547
00:22:58.057 --> 00:23:00.559
-Christmas tree!
-(mouse grunts)


548
00:23:03.312 --> 00:23:04.772
(laughs)

549
00:23:04.814 --> 00:23:06.899
Take that, Appliance Al.

550
00:23:06.941 --> 00:23:08.567
Wow, we're gonna do it, Rabbit.

551
00:23:08.609 --> 00:23:10.861
Looks like
you're going to do it, too, sir.


552
00:23:10.903 --> 00:23:13.114
You mean,
get back on the nice list?


553
00:23:13.155 --> 00:23:14.699
You're almost there.

554
00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:17.451
Wow.

555
00:23:17.493 --> 00:23:20.204
Feliz Navidad,
red velvet Jet Ski.


556
00:23:20.246 --> 00:23:23.791
And a merry Christmas to you,
red velvet monster truck.


557
00:23:23.833 --> 00:23:27.295
And you-- you must be my red
velvet robot butler, Alberto.


558
00:23:27.336 --> 00:23:28.963
Welcome!

559
00:23:29.005 --> 00:23:32.341
(robotically):
We are drifting off course, sir.


560
00:23:32.383 --> 00:23:34.719
Oh, that's wonderful, Alberto.

561
00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:36.387
I would beg to differ...

562
00:23:36.429 --> 00:23:37.805
sir.

563
00:23:37.847 --> 00:23:39.557
Wha... what? Huh?!

564
00:23:39.598 --> 00:23:41.183
Where's my hot tub?

565
00:23:41.225 --> 00:23:43.185
My monster truck? Alberto?

566
00:23:43.227 --> 00:23:45.563
Duck, where's the bull's-eye?

567
00:23:45.604 --> 00:23:48.274
And why are we drifting
towards Appliance Al's?


568
00:23:48.316 --> 00:23:50.818
Hey, I think there's a deal
going on next door!


569
00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:52.528
Ooh, Appliance Al's.
Let's go over there.


570
00:23:52.570 --> 00:23:54.155
-(overlapping chatter)
-Come on, guys.


571
00:23:54.196 --> 00:23:56.532
Ugh! Fine.
No customers, no cash!


572
00:23:58.743 --> 00:24:00.619
Uh, thanks, animals!

573
00:24:00.661 --> 00:24:03.122
Couldn't have done it
without you. (laughs)


574
00:24:04.915 --> 00:24:06.500
(groans)
Bad news, sir.


575
00:24:06.542 --> 00:24:08.586
You're back
on the naughty list again.


576
00:24:08.627 --> 00:24:11.088
No bull's-eye, no bacon--

577
00:24:11.130 --> 00:24:13.382
and it's all my fault.

578
00:24:14.842 --> 00:24:18.304
Oh, man, how could things
get any worse?


579
00:24:18.346 --> 00:24:20.681
Somebody get me my hair dryer.

580
00:24:22.850 --> 00:24:24.685
(sniffles, coughs)

581
00:24:24.727 --> 00:24:28.606
Oh, happy almost Christmas,
everybody.


582
00:24:28.647 --> 00:24:30.608
I'm sorry I can't join y'all

583
00:24:30.649 --> 00:24:33.027

of Christmas.

00:24:33.069 --> 00:24:36.113
(coughs) But you-you know
what'd be swell?


585
00:24:36.155 --> 00:24:38.199
Y'all could watch it for me.

586
00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:39.658
Would you do that?

587
00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:41.410
-Yeah!
-Mm-hmm! -Ooh!


588
00:24:41.452 --> 00:24:42.828
Well, better move along now.

589
00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:44.872
The show's almost over.

590
00:24:46.082 --> 00:24:48.959
The end? I can't believe it.

591

asked him for the dryer?

Isn't it way too late for that?
