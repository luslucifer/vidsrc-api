¢Ü Turn it up! ¢Ü

2
00:00:54.868 --> 00:00:58.371
¢Ü Turn up the radio ¢Ü

3
00:00:59.164 --> 00:01:03.167
¢Ü I need the music
Give me some more ¢Ü


4
00:01:04.127 --> 00:01:05.795
Come on, Boots,
you have three minutes left.


5
00:01:05.879 --> 00:01:08.965
You can do this.
You came to me, remember?


6
00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:11.217
It's not about losing weight.
It's about a lifestyle change.


7
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.726
Nick, you have a customer.

8
00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:22.853
Like we practiced.

9
00:01:22.938 --> 00:01:24.772
Right away, Terry.

10
00:01:27.943 --> 00:01:29.402
'Sup, dawg?

11
00:01:30.904 --> 00:01:32.863
Oh. Ha! Funny.

12
00:01:32.948 --> 00:01:34.073
It's the name of the store.

13
00:01:34.241 --> 00:01:35.366
What can I do for you, man?

14
00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.327
Bono has been doing
this for three days.


15
00:01:39.663 --> 00:01:40.871
It's fucking
disgusting.


16
00:01:40.956 --> 00:01:41.956
Bring him up here.

17
00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.666
Bono, Bono, come.

18
00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:44.750
Bono, up!

19
00:01:44.835 --> 00:01:46.502
Don't yell at him like that.

20
00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.879
Okay. Okay. Cool.
You're gonna...


21
00:01:48.964 --> 00:01:50.798
I might just look...

22
00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:58.639
Do I know you?

23
00:01:58.765 --> 00:01:59.974
I know you.

24
00:02:00.058 --> 00:02:01.976
You're the singer
from Chocolate Lipstick.


25
00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.769
You guys used to play
at the Jam Shack on Friday nights.


26
00:02:03.854 --> 00:02:05.271
Damn!
You remember that?


27
00:02:05.355 --> 00:02:06.439
You were so good.
Yeah.


28
00:02:06.523 --> 00:02:07.773
Oh, my God,
you still singing?


29
00:02:07.858 --> 00:02:10.359
Nah. That was
a long time ago.


30
00:02:10.444 --> 00:02:12.695
Wow! What are you
doing now?


31
00:02:14.114 --> 00:02:16.490
You get shit
out of dogs' asses.


32
00:02:16.742 --> 00:02:18.451
That's great.

33
00:02:18.785 --> 00:02:20.411
You own a BMW?

34
00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:22.705
Yeah, can you tell?

35
00:02:26.668 --> 00:02:28.085
Good boy.

36
00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:30.921
<i>Adam, it's Lou.
Don't hang up, okay?</i>


37
00:02:31.006 --> 00:02:32.965
<i>It's not about money.
It's about making money.</i>


38
00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:34.633
<i>You and me, buddy.</i>

39
00:02:34.718 --> 00:02:36.052
<i>Hi, it's me.</i>

40
00:02:36.136 --> 00:02:39.055
<i>So, I did everything according
to your stupid fucking plan.</i>


41
00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:40.890
<i>I took everything
with the yellow stickers</i>


42
00:02:40.974 --> 00:02:44.101
<i>and I left you everything with
the red stickers.</i>


43
00:02:45.312 --> 00:02:47.438
<i>There was some stuff in your closet
with no stickers,</i>


44
00:02:47.522 --> 00:02:49.899
<i>so I threw that in a pile and burned it
in the backyard.</i>


45
00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:52.902
<i>Seemed like the right thing to do.</i>

46
00:02:52.986 --> 00:02:55.237
<i>And thank you for claiming
that empty plastic bottle.</i>


47
00:02:55.322 --> 00:02:58.032
<i>I was prepared to
fight you on that one.</i>


48
00:02:58.492 --> 00:03:01.077
<i>Anyway, I left you
something on the counter.</i>


49
00:03:01.161 --> 00:03:03.829
<i>It's from the heart.</i>

50
00:03:06.166 --> 00:03:08.876
<i>Oh, and one last thing.</i>
Um...


51
00:03:09.086 --> 00:03:12.838
<i>The TV had a red sticker on it,
but I took it anyway.</i>


52
00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:15.841
<i>Bye.</i>

53
00:03:16.593 --> 00:03:18.677
Just keeping
my head down.


54
00:03:21.681 --> 00:03:26.268
Not getting shivved today.
Let's knock these reps out.
Mmm! Mmm!


55
00:03:30.273 --> 00:03:33.192
Turn on a light, Jake.
Open a window.


56
00:03:33.276 --> 00:03:35.986
Go outdoors.
Jesus Christ!


57
00:03:36.071 --> 00:03:37.696
Why don't you get out of the
house this weekend, huh?


58
00:03:37.823 --> 00:03:40.866
What should I do out of the house,
Uncle Adam?


59
00:03:41.201 --> 00:03:43.285
I don't know. Anything
that corresponds with reality.


60
00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.788
Apply for a job.
Maybe try to go
to college.


61
00:03:45.872 --> 00:03:47.498
I don't know.
That all sounds kind of overrated.


62
00:03:47.582 --> 00:03:49.125
You don't like it,
you can move back in with your mom.


63
00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:51.252
No, I can't actually.
She moved in with her new boyfriend.


64
00:03:51.336 --> 00:03:53.087
I will not be
anywhere near that.


65
00:03:53.171 --> 00:03:54.255
She moved in with him?

66
00:03:54.339 --> 00:03:56.090
Yeah, the taxidermist.

67
00:03:57.008 --> 00:03:59.093
The taxidermist is
stuffing my mother.


68
00:03:59.177 --> 00:04:00.261
Ugh! Kelly.

69
00:04:00.345 --> 00:04:02.680
She's your sister. You should call her
once in a while. Check in.


70
00:04:02.764 --> 00:04:04.682
Well, maybe she should check in with me.
Ever think of that?


71
00:04:04.766 --> 00:04:06.100
Yeah.
That's interesting.


72
00:04:06.184 --> 00:04:07.852
Listen, I've got a big court date
in a few minutes.


73
00:04:07.936 --> 00:04:09.812
- If I miss it, I'm kind of screwed.
- Why do you waste your time


74
00:04:09.896 --> 00:04:11.272
with that Second Life bullshit?

75
00:04:11.356 --> 00:04:13.524
Look at you, you're still in jail.
You were in jail last week.


76
00:04:13.608 --> 00:04:15.693
Yeah. I'm a prisoner.
It's called "doing hard time."


77
00:04:15.777 --> 00:04:17.361
Can't you be like
a warrior or a shaman


78
00:04:17.445 --> 00:04:18.654
or an Orc or some shit
like that?


79
00:04:18.738 --> 00:04:20.823
No, no. In life,
you make choices,


80
00:04:20.907 --> 00:04:22.658
and if you screw up
you have to pay
for those choices.


81
00:04:22.742 --> 00:04:25.077
You're 20 years old,
you haven't made an important
choice in your life.


82
00:04:25.162 --> 00:04:27.830
What are you mad about?
What is this?


83
00:04:29.124 --> 00:04:31.167
I don't know if you noticed,
but Lily moved out.


84
00:04:31.251 --> 00:04:33.085
Is that what all
the shuffling was?


85
00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:34.253
Uh-huh.

86
00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.589
What did you do?

87
00:04:38.175 --> 00:04:40.050
I didn't do anything.

88
00:04:57.611 --> 00:04:59.403
No fucking way!

100
00:05:59.756 --> 00:06:01.006
Hello.

101
00:06:02.008 --> 00:06:03.217
What?

102
00:06:06.596 --> 00:06:07.888
Fuck!

103
00:06:11.309 --> 00:06:12.726
Hey. Adam.

104
00:06:13.645 --> 00:06:15.562
- What's happening, man?
- Hey.


105
00:06:15.647 --> 00:06:17.022
You all right?

106
00:06:19.192 --> 00:06:20.651
- Hi, Courtney.
- Hey, how you doing?


107
00:06:20.735 --> 00:06:22.403
- Nice to see you.
- You, too.


108
00:06:22.487 --> 00:06:24.113
- Yeah.
- Not here.


109
00:06:24.197 --> 00:06:25.614
Long time.

110
00:06:25.699 --> 00:06:27.491
Yeah. You know...

111
00:06:28.201 --> 00:06:30.035
Work's been crazy and...

112
00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.288
- I know.
- I called a couple of times.


113
00:06:32.372 --> 00:06:33.455
Yeah. Yeah.

114
00:06:34.207 --> 00:06:35.666
Very, very busy.

115
00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:38.168
You think this is
a real situation


116
00:06:38.253 --> 00:06:40.921
or just one of his
bullshit episodes?


117
00:06:41.006 --> 00:06:42.506
I don't know.

118
00:06:42.716 --> 00:06:43.924
You never know with Lou.

119
00:06:44.009 --> 00:06:46.135
Well, hey, Adam,
how's your girlfriend?


120
00:06:46.219 --> 00:06:47.803
Oh, really bad.

121
00:06:48.263 --> 00:06:49.513
Okay.

122
00:06:51.891 --> 00:06:53.100
Happy times.

123
00:06:53.184 --> 00:06:56.061
Hi, folks.
I'm Dr. Jeff.
Lou's resting.


124
00:06:56.146 --> 00:06:59.148
He's denying that it was a suicide
attempt and medically he's stable,


125
00:06:59.232 --> 00:07:00.774
so legally we can't
keep him here.


126
00:07:00.859 --> 00:07:03.152
But we do think that he should
be monitored for a few days.


127
00:07:03.236 --> 00:07:04.820
Does he have any family?

128
00:07:04.904 --> 00:07:06.405
Lou's family all
kind of hate him.


129
00:07:06.489 --> 00:07:09.408
Okay. Well, then I guess it's up
to you guys, his friends.


130
00:07:09.492 --> 00:07:11.577
You are his friends, right?

131
00:07:13.747 --> 00:07:15.205
It's like that friend
who's the asshole.


132
00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:16.915
But he's our asshole,
you know?


133
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.208
Right.

134
00:07:18.585 --> 00:07:19.752
Yeah.

135

<i>Dr. Jefferies to radiology.</i>

136
00:07:26.676 --> 00:07:28.969
Lou.
Why would he do this?


137
00:07:29.346 --> 00:07:31.597
Why? I mean,
make a list.


138
00:07:31.681 --> 00:07:33.640
He's an alcoholic,
he's divorced.


139
00:07:33.725 --> 00:07:35.642
Wife ran off with
that Jamaican guy.


140
00:07:35.727 --> 00:07:38.604
He's failed at every jive-ass
money hustle he's ever tried.


141
00:07:38.688 --> 00:07:40.272
He's in
a mountain of debt.


142
00:07:40.357 --> 00:07:41.398
He hates his mother.

143
00:07:41.483 --> 00:07:42.983
He hates himself.
He hates everybody.


144
00:07:43.068 --> 00:07:44.318
He has erectile dysfunction.

145
00:07:44.402 --> 00:07:45.569
He's got halitosis.

146
00:07:45.653 --> 00:07:47.154
He's got
that runt ball.


147
00:07:47.238 --> 00:07:48.238
Huh.

148
00:07:48.323 --> 00:07:50.783
He said one of his balls
was shriveled up...


149
00:07:50.867 --> 00:07:52.034
Oh, yeah.

150
00:07:52.118 --> 00:07:53.660
...like a spoiled grape.

151
00:07:53.745 --> 00:07:56.121
Wasn't it that
quarterback on the Bears


152
00:07:56.206 --> 00:07:58.290
who had his ball crushed
on the field. Right?


153
00:07:58.375 --> 00:07:59.875
- Yeah.
- Yeah.


154
00:07:59.959 --> 00:08:02.711
- Right, right.
- '82? Yeah, yeah.


155
00:08:02.796 --> 00:08:03.962
He came back
from that, though.


156
00:08:04.047 --> 00:08:05.089
Strong as ever.

157
00:08:05.173 --> 00:08:06.173
Fuck yeah.

158
00:08:06.257 --> 00:08:07.424
But I don't know about Lou.

159
00:08:07.509 --> 00:08:09.051
- It's just like...
- No.


160
00:08:09.135 --> 00:08:12.054
It's just like
an accumulation of punishment.


161
00:08:12.138 --> 00:08:13.138
Fuck you guys.

162
00:08:13.223 --> 00:08:14.223
- Oh!
- Hey!


163
00:08:14.307 --> 00:08:16.225
There he is. Hey.

164
00:08:16.309 --> 00:08:18.811
I can fucking hear everything
you're saying, all right?


165
00:08:18.895 --> 00:08:21.313
Look who's awake.
What's up, man?


166
00:08:22.232 --> 00:08:23.857
- Hey.
- Hey, man.


167
00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:25.150
What's up?

168
00:08:25.235 --> 00:08:28.070
You look just
like my friend Nick.


169
00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:30.239
And you look
like my friend Adam.


170
00:08:30.323 --> 00:08:31.573
But you wouldn't be
those guys because


171
00:08:31.658 --> 00:08:32.825
I've been calling
and calling them,


172
00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:33.909
and they haven't
returned my calls.


173
00:08:33.993 --> 00:08:35.661
So, listen, Violator.

174
00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:38.914
Me and Nick
got a little surprise
for you.


175
00:08:38.998 --> 00:08:41.750
Something special
that the three of us can do.


176
00:08:41.835 --> 00:08:43.127
Come on. You guys.

177
00:08:43.253 --> 00:08:44.503
- Are you curious?
- No!


178
00:08:44.587 --> 00:08:46.922
I didn't fucking try
and kill myself.


179
00:08:47.006 --> 00:08:49.716
If I wanted to kill myself,
I'd fucking kill myself.


180
00:08:49.801 --> 00:08:50.968
I'd be awesome at it.

181
00:08:51.052 --> 00:08:52.761
A shotgun to the dick.

182
00:08:53.388 --> 00:08:54.596
I'm glad you didn't do it.

183
00:08:54.681 --> 00:08:57.099
It's good to see
you guys, anyway.


184
00:08:59.227 --> 00:09:02.271
So, just out of curiosity,
what's the surprise?


185
00:09:02.355 --> 00:09:03.897
Tell him.

186
00:09:04.274 --> 00:09:06.942
Ko-di-ak...

187
00:09:07.569 --> 00:09:08.610
...Valley.

188
00:09:08.695 --> 00:09:09.778
No fucking way!

189
00:09:09.863 --> 00:09:10.863
- Yes, sir.
- Yeah.


190
00:09:10.947 --> 00:09:12.906
Fucking K-Vals?
Holy shit!


191
00:09:12.991 --> 00:09:14.366
Yes, sir. Bang!

192
00:09:14.617 --> 00:09:17.286
We fucking ski, right?
We fucking rage.


193
00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:18.579
Chimney Point
at the end of the night


194
00:09:18.663 --> 00:09:22.166
with a bottle of scotch
to wash it all down. Oh!


195
00:09:22.584 --> 00:09:25.043
And you guys are paying
for the whole thing?


196
00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:26.712
- Sure.
- Yep.


197
00:09:26.796 --> 00:09:27.796
Let's go tonight.

198
00:09:27.881 --> 00:09:28.881
We go tomorrow.

199
00:09:28.965 --> 00:09:29.965
Let's go now.
Let's go now.


200
00:09:30.049 --> 00:09:32.259
I just got to get rid of this thing.
It's really uncomfortable.


201
00:09:32.343 --> 00:09:33.510
You should wait
for the nurse or something.


202
00:09:33.595 --> 00:09:35.012
I got it. I got it.

203
00:09:35.096 --> 00:09:36.096
- Hold on, Lou.
- No, no, no, no.


204
00:09:36.181 --> 00:09:38.599
Let somebody
do that for you.


205
00:09:47.066 --> 00:09:48.609
- Oh, shit.
- God.


206
00:09:48.693 --> 00:09:49.735
Did I get that on you?

207
00:09:49.819 --> 00:09:51.028
- Yes, you did.
- Damn it!


208
00:09:51.112 --> 00:09:53.739
It's only pee.
Relax, it's only pee.


209
00:09:58.661 --> 00:09:59.661
There's Lou.

210
00:09:59.746 --> 00:10:01.038
Good,
he's drinking already.


211
00:10:01.122 --> 00:10:02.581
Look at this shit.

212
00:10:02.665 --> 00:10:04.917
Do you remember when I was 12
and he tried to bite me?


213
00:10:05.001 --> 00:10:07.586
Yeah, but he...
You had that coming.


214
00:10:08.379 --> 00:10:10.255
- Hey, Violator.
- Lou.


215
00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:12.257
What the fuck
is he doing here?


216
00:10:12.342 --> 00:10:13.509
It's nice to
see you, too, Lou.


217
00:10:13.593 --> 00:10:16.261
"Nice to see you, too, Lou."
Fuck you, Jacob.


218
00:10:16.346 --> 00:10:18.180
You suck and you know it.

219
00:10:18.264 --> 00:10:20.516
You just ruined
my fucking weekend.


220
00:10:30.276 --> 00:10:33.529
Hey, Lily will come back.
Trust me.


221
00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:35.697
- No, she won't.
- No, she won't.


222
00:10:35.782 --> 00:10:37.074
- No, she won't.
- No, she won't.


223
00:10:37.158 --> 00:10:38.909
She basically thinks
I'm an asshole, you know?


224
00:10:38.993 --> 00:10:40.911
Like a completely self-absorbed,
delusional...


225
00:10:40.995 --> 00:10:42.663
- She's got a point.
- ...narcissistic.


226
00:10:42.747 --> 00:10:44.206
- Fuck you.
- You're better off.


227
00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:46.458
Take my word for it.
Look at me.


228
00:10:46.543 --> 00:10:48.794
Fuck wives, man.
Fuck kids.


229
00:10:48.878 --> 00:10:51.213
Lock it down or they will take
everything from you.


230
00:10:53.091 --> 00:10:55.801
God damn it!
Who the fuck are you texting with?


231
00:10:55.885 --> 00:10:56.969
Just a friend of mine.

232
00:10:57.053 --> 00:10:58.804
Male or fucking female?

233
00:10:58.888 --> 00:11:01.848
For your information,
I've had a lot of girlfriends.


234
00:11:01.933 --> 00:11:02.933
Hot ones.

235
00:11:03.017 --> 00:11:05.686
You have had lots
of boyfriends. Gay ones.


236
00:11:10.108 --> 00:11:12.067
Hey, hey, hey,
check this out.


237
00:11:12.151 --> 00:11:14.069
I brought a regulation bar
for tubbing tonight.


238
00:11:14.153 --> 00:11:15.195
Nice.

239
00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:18.323
I've got vodka,
fucking Tequilles O'Neals.


240
00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:21.451
You guys are gonna love this.
Check this out.


241
00:11:21.536 --> 00:11:22.703
Chernobly.

242
00:11:22.787 --> 00:11:24.162
It's like
the Russian Red Bull.


243
00:11:24.247 --> 00:11:25.789
It's got shit in it
that's not even legal here.


244
00:11:25.873 --> 00:11:27.291
Like what shit?

245
00:11:27.542 --> 00:11:29.084
How the fuck am I
supposed to know, dude?


246
00:11:29.168 --> 00:11:30.836
But it's illegal.

247
00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:32.170
Hey, why didn't we
just go to Pinnacle?


248
00:11:32.255 --> 00:11:33.797
It would have taken,
like, half the time.


249
00:11:33.881 --> 00:11:35.799
You wanna go
to Kodiak Valley,
trust me.


250
00:11:35.883 --> 00:11:37.134
You're at
the right age for it.


251
00:11:37.218 --> 00:11:38.468
Really?

252
00:11:38.553 --> 00:11:41.471
Yeah. Nobody gets carded
and everybody gets laid.


253
00:11:41.931 --> 00:11:46.101
- K-Val! K-Val! K-Val!
- K-Val! K-Val! K-Val!


254
00:11:46.185 --> 00:11:47.894
Oh, shit! K
-Val!

255
00:11:53.234 --> 00:11:55.652
This? This is
the coolest town ever?


256
00:11:56.779 --> 00:11:58.530
Fuck!
That used to be Papa Enzo's.


257
00:12:00.074 --> 00:12:02.326
I broke up with
Jenny Stedmeyer there.


258
00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:03.660
What made you break
up with her, again?


259
00:12:03.745 --> 00:12:06.204
I don't know.
We swapped virginities junior year.


260
00:12:06.289 --> 00:12:07.914
All we did was
listen to records and have sex.


261
00:12:07.999 --> 00:12:10.626
And she was epic, I mean she was...
She was epic.


262
00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:11.793
Yeah, man.
She was hot.


263
00:12:11.878 --> 00:12:13.712
And then when I broke up
with her, she was so mad,


264
00:12:13.796 --> 00:12:16.048
she practically stabbed me
in the eye with a fork.


265
00:12:16.132 --> 00:12:18.175
Actually, she did stab me
in the eye with a fork.


266
00:12:18.259 --> 00:12:19.426
She was a one-percenter, man.

267
00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:20.510
Yeah.

268
00:12:20.595 --> 00:12:21.928
All downhill from there.

269
00:12:22.555 --> 00:12:25.182
That was a big one.
First love.


270
00:12:25.266 --> 00:12:26.516
The one that got away.

271
00:12:26.601 --> 00:12:28.560
The great white buffalo.

272
00:12:28.645 --> 00:12:29.811
- Yeah.
- Yeah.


273
00:12:29.896 --> 00:12:31.396
The great what?

274
00:12:31.481 --> 00:12:33.273
Great white buffalo.

275
00:12:33.358 --> 00:12:35.359
Why are you guys
whispering?


276
00:12:35.443 --> 00:12:37.361
Great white buffalo.

277
00:12:37.445 --> 00:12:40.072
That was really helpful,
you guys. Thank you.


278
00:12:47.205 --> 00:12:48.872
Look at this place.

279
00:12:48.956 --> 00:12:50.666
I'm gonna make
a prediction right now.


280
00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:52.376
One of us is gonna
start writing a novel,


281
00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:54.002
and then we all
get snowed in,


282
00:12:54.087 --> 00:12:56.588
and then Lou's gonna
ax murder all of us.


283
00:13:01.469 --> 00:13:03.011
Motherfuck.

284
00:13:03.096 --> 00:13:04.638
What's that smell?

285
00:13:04.722 --> 00:13:05.681
Fucking cats.

286
00:13:06.891 --> 00:13:09.726
Kind of a lot of cats.
This sucks.


287
00:13:09.936 --> 00:13:11.103
- Hi.
- Hi.


288
00:13:11.521 --> 00:13:12.979
You got a reservation

289
00:13:13.064 --> 00:13:14.815
For Webber
-Agnew?

290
00:13:14.899 --> 00:13:16.358
Sorry. What was that
name again?


291
00:13:16.442 --> 00:13:18.985
Webber-Agnew.
Webber and Agnew.


292
00:13:19.612 --> 00:13:20.987
I got a "Nick Webber
-Agnew."

293
00:13:21.072 --> 00:13:23.699
I'm sorry, excuse me. What?
What did you just say?


294
00:13:23.783 --> 00:13:24.825
Webber
-Agnew?

295
00:13:24.909 --> 00:13:27.119
Webber-fucking
-Agnew?

296
00:13:27.704 --> 00:13:30.205
You took your wife's last name?
You're a fucking hyphenate?


297
00:13:30.289 --> 00:13:32.457
A lot of dudes are doing it.
It's progressive.


298
00:13:32.542 --> 00:13:34.209
No. No dudes
are doing it.


299
00:13:34.293 --> 00:13:35.961
You look like a progressive guy.
Is that progressive?


300
00:13:36.045 --> 00:13:37.629
- Would you do that? No.
- No.


301
00:13:37.714 --> 00:13:39.256
And he has a goatee.

302
00:13:43.136 --> 00:13:44.720
Does this guy seem a little
imbalanced to you?


303
00:13:44.804 --> 00:13:45.804
No. Come on.

304
00:13:45.888 --> 00:13:47.139
He's right there.
Shut up.


305
00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:50.600
Let me give you
a hand with that.


306
00:13:50.685 --> 00:13:51.852
Hey!

307
00:13:51.936 --> 00:13:54.646
I am not going
to tell you again!


308
00:13:57.650 --> 00:13:59.192
I can handle it.

309
00:13:59.944 --> 00:14:01.403
This guy's
a fucking dick.


310
00:14:01.487 --> 00:14:03.613
- Shh. He's disabled.
- He can hear you.


311
00:14:03.698 --> 00:14:05.824
So what? He's exempt from
common fucking courtesy


312
00:14:05.908 --> 00:14:07.325
'cause he can't start
a round of applause?


313
00:14:08.828 --> 00:14:10.328
He's gotta jerk
off one-handed?


314
00:14:10.413 --> 00:14:12.456
I mean, I certainly
don't take my hands


315
00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:14.207
and I put them together
and oil them up...


316
00:14:14.292 --> 00:14:17.252
Hey, 420. Our old room.
Check it out.


317
00:14:19.005 --> 00:14:20.213
- That's okay man.
- Oh! Those are mine.


318
00:14:20.298 --> 00:14:21.965
I'll just get those.

319
00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:32.851
This is the part where you tip
the guy that helped you out.


320
00:14:33.144 --> 00:14:35.562
I'm not the guy that...

321
00:14:35.646 --> 00:14:36.813
Nick, pay the man
something.


322
00:14:36.898 --> 00:14:38.106
I got it.
Don't worry.


323
00:14:38.191 --> 00:14:39.357
This place
looks like shit!


324
00:14:39.442 --> 00:14:41.568
What happened
to that guy?


325
00:14:42.069 --> 00:14:44.738
Check this shit out.
It's still there.


326
00:14:45.072 --> 00:14:47.365
Adam sucks cocks 'n' dicks.

327
00:14:48.034 --> 00:14:49.576
It's your best work.

328
00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:51.036
Fucking burned you.

329
00:14:51.996 --> 00:14:52.954
Burned!

330
00:14:53.039 --> 00:14:54.122
Hey, guys,
come take a look at this.


331
00:14:54.207 --> 00:14:56.124
We got a hot tub.

332
00:14:58.211 --> 00:15:00.003
- Sweet Jesus!
- Poor little fella.


333
00:15:00.087 --> 00:15:02.214
This is obviously
unacceptable, right?


334
00:15:02.298 --> 00:15:05.050
We call downstairs,
get somebody to fix this?


335
00:15:05.134 --> 00:15:06.259
Is anybody else hungry?

336
00:15:08.846 --> 00:15:10.722
A little school spirit
this time, huh?


337
00:15:10.848 --> 00:15:12.682
- We're in, man.
- Just play it like you fucking mean it.


338
00:15:12.767 --> 00:15:14.601
- Like that.
- Yeah.


339
00:15:15.728 --> 00:15:19.606
Yes, I would like to get a hooker
to fuck me and my friends.


340
00:15:20.358 --> 00:15:22.526
What? Adam,
I'm not doing that.


341
00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:23.777
Whatever, semantics.

342
00:15:23.861 --> 00:15:27.823
I want an escort to escort
our penises into her vagina.


343
00:15:29.033 --> 00:15:31.117
I want the girl
in the picture, too.


344
00:15:31.202 --> 00:15:33.495
- No tomfoolery.
- Wake her up, I don't care.


345
00:15:33.579 --> 00:15:34.788
Will you listen to him?

346
00:15:34.872 --> 00:15:36.039
Does she do four?

347
00:15:36.123 --> 00:15:37.833
What about three?

348
00:15:37.917 --> 00:15:39.501
- Okay. Jacob, you're out.
- Okay. Good.


349
00:15:39.585 --> 00:15:41.169
I need $3,000.

350
00:15:41.254 --> 00:15:42.254
I'm not in.
I'm married.


351
00:15:42.338 --> 00:15:45.590
- Adam, I need $2,000. Me and you, buddy.
- Come on.


352
00:15:45.675 --> 00:15:46.800
I'm out there, Violator.

353
00:15:46.884 --> 00:15:48.343
Can I call you back, sir?

354
00:15:48.427 --> 00:15:50.512
- Okay. Thank you. Bye.
- Sir?


355
00:15:50.596 --> 00:15:52.973
Let's do something fun.
Let's create a memory, huh?


356
00:15:53.057 --> 00:15:55.642
Let's get some cocaine
and break into a school.


357
00:15:55.726 --> 00:15:58.353
Or steal a cop car
or some shit, huh?


358
00:15:58.437 --> 00:16:00.021
- Do you have Ritalin?
- No.


359
00:16:00.106 --> 00:16:03.942
Don't fucking lie to me.
Every one of you people have Ritalin.


360
00:16:04.026 --> 00:16:05.068
No, I don't.

361
00:16:05.152 --> 00:16:06.736
I'm sorry.
You probably do have Ritalin.


362
00:16:06.821 --> 00:16:08.154
I have some Ativan,
but it's different.


363
00:16:08.239 --> 00:16:09.739
- Let's stick it up our asses.
- Just give it to him.


364
00:16:09.824 --> 00:16:11.241
No. It's not
a suppository.


365
00:16:11.325 --> 00:16:14.035
It doesn't matter.
You crush it, you put it
in a warm paper towel,


366
00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:16.705
run it under warm some water and you
stick it right up your ass. That works.


367
00:16:16.789 --> 00:16:18.164
You put the paper towel
up your ass, too?


368
00:16:18.291 --> 00:16:19.624
- You crush up the...
- Hey, I got an idea,


369
00:16:19.667 --> 00:16:21.084
- why don't we just play quarters?
- What?


370
00:16:21.168 --> 00:16:23.879
I don't know what the fuck I'm gonna do.
I'm getting really sad.


371
00:16:23.963 --> 00:16:25.380
You know what
I'm talking about?


372
00:16:25.464 --> 00:16:27.716
I'm gonna go to the bathroom and
be alone with my own thoughts.


373
00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:29.217
Who knows what's
gonna happen up there.


374
00:16:29.302 --> 00:16:30.302
Who knows
what's gonna happen.


375
00:16:30.386 --> 00:16:31.928
You better plan
something fun.


376
00:16:34.056 --> 00:16:35.390
Jesus!

377
00:16:35.850 --> 00:16:37.601
Pussies.
I'm going dancing.


378
00:16:37.685 --> 00:16:40.020
I don't know, man.
Maybe coming here was a bad idea.


379
00:16:40.104 --> 00:16:43.899
Yeah.
If he kills himself,
can we go home?


380
00:16:43.983 --> 00:16:45.317
Hard to believe
this is the very room


381
00:16:45.401 --> 00:16:47.819
we had some of
the best weekends of our lives.


382
00:16:47.904 --> 00:16:50.280
Really?
In this room right here?


383
00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:52.824
How?

384
00:16:52.909 --> 00:16:56.119
We were young. We had momentum.
We were winning.


385
00:16:57.580 --> 00:16:59.247
We were best friends.

386
00:16:59.332 --> 00:17:00.749
What do you mean,
"were" best friends?


387
00:17:00.833 --> 00:17:03.585
You know what I mean, man.
Everybody seemed to care more.


388
00:17:03.669 --> 00:17:06.087
Everything seemed
to matter more back then.


389
00:17:06.172 --> 00:17:07.464
Whatever.

390
00:17:18.517 --> 00:17:20.894
Check it out.
They must have fixed it.


391
00:17:21.812 --> 00:17:23.146
Come on!

392
00:17:23.981 --> 00:17:25.774
- How's the water, Violator?
- Oh, man.


393
00:17:25.858 --> 00:17:28.860
You guys gotta get in here.
It's gonna fucking change you.


394
00:17:28.945 --> 00:17:30.487
Wait, why are you naked?

395
00:17:30.571 --> 00:17:31.613
You're all getting naked?

396
00:17:31.697 --> 00:17:32.906
Yep.

397
00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:34.032
You don't think
it's a little weird,


398
00:17:34.116 --> 00:17:35.283
a bunch of guys
just piling up


399
00:17:35.368 --> 00:17:36.618
in a big bathtub
together, naked?


400
00:17:36.702 --> 00:17:38.995
Are you afraid
that some of these
people might see you?


401
00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:40.455
I'm sorry.
If I'm being honest,


402
00:17:40.539 --> 00:17:43.833
I'm not totally comfortable being around
a bunch of other naked dudes.


403
00:17:43.918 --> 00:17:45.418
It's called
male bonding, okay?


404
00:17:45.503 --> 00:17:47.754
Haven't you even
seen Wild Hogs?


405
00:17:47.838 --> 00:17:49.214
<i>Fine, get us some snacks.</i>

406
00:17:49.298 --> 00:17:50.924
You know what? Fuck it.

407
00:17:52.051 --> 00:17:53.760
I'm leaving
my underwear on.


408
00:17:53.844 --> 00:17:55.679
Yeah. Yeah. Very nice.
Shut up!


409
00:17:58.224 --> 00:18:00.475
Damn, it's good to be here
with you all again, man.


410
00:18:00.601 --> 00:18:02.519
- It's good to be back here with you guys.
- Yep.


411
00:18:02.603 --> 00:18:04.145
I want to toast
to the good times.


412
00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:07.190
And you, too, young blood.
Come on in, here.


413
00:18:08.734 --> 00:18:09.943
Yeah!

414
00:18:11.654 --> 00:18:13.405
¢Ü This style seems wild ¢Ü

415
00:18:13.489 --> 00:18:15.323
¢Ü Wait before you treat me
like a stepchild ¢Ü


416
00:18:15.408 --> 00:18:17.200
¢Ü Let me tell you why
they got me on file ¢Ü


417
00:18:17.284 --> 00:18:18.660
¢Ü 'Cause I give you
what you lack ¢Ü


418
00:18:18.744 --> 00:18:21.663
¢Ü Come right and exact
I stand accused of doing harm ¢Ü


419
00:18:21.747 --> 00:18:23.164
¢Ü 'Cause I'm louder than a bomb ¢Ü

420
00:18:23.249 --> 00:18:26.042
¢Ü Come on
Come on, louder ¢Ü


421
00:18:26.127 --> 00:18:27.502
¢Ü Come on
Come on ¢Ü


422
00:18:27.586 --> 00:18:29.087
- Go, Violator!
- I'm gonna throw up.


423
00:18:29.171 --> 00:18:31.172
Snap out of it!
Out the tub! Out the tub!


424
00:18:31.257 --> 00:18:32.716
I'm good. I'm good.
I'm good.


425
00:18:33.926 --> 00:18:37.429
¢Ü I am a rock hard trooper
To the bone, the bone, the bone ¢Ü


426
00:18:37.513 --> 00:18:39.806
¢Ü Full grown
Consider me stone ¢Ü


427
00:18:39.890 --> 00:18:42.183
¢Ü Once again and
I say it for you to know ¢Ü


428
00:18:42.268 --> 00:18:44.269
¢Ü The troop is always ready
I yell "Geronimo" ¢Ü


429
00:18:44.353 --> 00:18:46.396
¢Ü Your CIA,
you see I ain't kiddin' ¢Ü


430
00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:48.523
¢Ü Both King and X
They got rid of both ¢Ü

431
00:18:51.736 --> 00:18:53.945
¢Ü And not the braggin'
or boastin' and plus ¢Ü


432
00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:55.572
¢Ü It ain't no secret why
they're tappin' my phone ¢Ü


433
00:18:55.656 --> 00:18:57.365
¢Ü Although I can't
keep it a secret ¢Ü

434
00:18:57.450 --> 00:18:59.117
¢Ü So I decided
to kick it, yo ¢Ü

435
00:18:59.201 --> 00:19:00.326
¢Ü And yes it weighs a ton ¢Ü

436
00:19:00.411 --> 00:19:01.369
¢Ü I say it once again ¢Ü

437
00:19:01.454 --> 00:19:03.329
¢Ü Tappin' my phone
They never leave me alone ¢Ü


438
00:19:04.790 --> 00:19:06.791
¢Ü 'Cause I'm louder than a bomb ¢Ü

439
00:19:24.101 --> 00:19:25.977
Hey, little buddy.

440
00:19:34.904 --> 00:19:36.029
Dude.

441
00:19:38.783 --> 00:19:40.867
Where did the squirrel go?

442
00:19:42.411 --> 00:19:44.245
Yeah. Yeah!

443
00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:46.164
- This is the black diamond?
- Shit.


444
00:19:46.207 --> 00:19:47.457
- Terrifying.
- That's all you got?


445
00:19:47.583 --> 00:19:49.417
- I don't remember this.
- What do you think, boys?


446
00:19:49.543 --> 00:19:50.585
Tips down.

447
00:19:50.669 --> 00:19:52.670
Tips fucking down,
right away.


448
00:19:52.797 --> 00:19:54.130
Let's ride.

449
00:20:06.644 --> 00:20:08.520
I feel 19 again!

450
00:20:12.191 --> 00:20:13.817
What is that?

451
00:20:14.318 --> 00:20:15.443
Stop it, Lou.

452
00:20:15.528 --> 00:20:17.112
Stop it, Lou!

453
00:20:19.448 --> 00:20:20.532
Whoo!

454
00:20:22.535 --> 00:20:23.493
Coming through!

455
00:20:23.577 --> 00:20:25.120
You goddamn kids!

456
00:20:30.126 --> 00:20:31.334
- Slow down!
- Hey!


457
00:20:31.418 --> 00:20:33.753
Yard sale, bitches!

458
00:20:56.527 --> 00:20:57.694
Fuck!

459
00:21:00.906 --> 00:21:01.990
We dead.

460
00:21:02.074 --> 00:21:04.659
Are you guys alive?
Holy fuck.


461
00:21:05.244 --> 00:21:09.205
By all counts we should be
pretty fucked up right now, but I...


462
00:21:09.582 --> 00:21:10.665
I kind of feel great.

463
00:21:10.749 --> 00:21:12.125
I feel crazy right now.

464
00:21:12.209 --> 00:21:13.793
I feel fantastic!

465
00:21:13.878 --> 00:21:16.546
I wanna fuck something!

466
00:21:20.551 --> 00:21:21.843
There they are.

467
00:21:21.927 --> 00:21:23.344
I see it, Chaz. Thanks.

468
00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:26.973
What is that
one plank thing
that guy's got?


469
00:21:27.057 --> 00:21:29.726
I don't care.
It's going up his ass.


470
00:21:31.979 --> 00:21:33.897
Way to go, rookie!

471
00:21:34.565 --> 00:21:36.024
Wow! Nice.

472
00:21:36.609 --> 00:21:38.151
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa...

473
00:21:40.112 --> 00:21:42.947
Those are the kind of ski shenanigans
I don't allow on my mountain.


474
00:21:43.032 --> 00:21:44.949
Yeah. Come on, guys.

475
00:21:45.743 --> 00:21:47.285
What are you
looking at, Nancy?


476
00:21:47.369 --> 00:21:48.953
No. I mean...

477
00:21:49.788 --> 00:21:53.458
<i>Hey, look, it's the douche bag
from Karate Kid III.</i>


478
00:21:57.338 --> 00:21:59.005
I know that guy.

479
00:22:21.362 --> 00:22:22.445
Hey, guys.

480
00:22:22.529 --> 00:22:25.114
Is there some kind of weird retro
thing going on this weekend?


481
00:22:25.199 --> 00:22:26.491
Can't get any bars.

482
00:22:26.575 --> 00:22:28.993
Morty!
Yeah, it's Chuck.


483
00:22:29.078 --> 00:22:31.246
You're never gonna
believe where I'm calling you from, man.


484
00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:34.499
I'm on a mountain
on my phone! Yeah.


485
00:22:35.292 --> 00:22:38.211
Yeah, well, a bet's a bet.
I want my $2.


486
00:22:43.634 --> 00:22:46.052
I'm telling you,
something weird is going on.


487
00:22:46.136 --> 00:22:48.137
<i>Demand your MTV.</i>

488
00:22:48.931 --> 00:22:51.099
<i>I want my MTV.</i>

489
00:22:52.977 --> 00:22:58.940
¢Ü S
-A
-F
-E
-T
-Y ¢Ü

490
00:22:59.191 --> 00:23:01.859
¢Ü Safe, dance! ¢Ü

491
00:23:06.573 --> 00:23:08.366
I love your hair.

492
00:23:10.494 --> 00:23:11.995
<i>I have a question.</i>

493
00:23:12.079 --> 00:23:14.163
<i>...can still
tell me that's true.</i>


494
00:23:14.248 --> 00:23:17.583
<i>But the facts and the evidence
tell me it is...</i>


495
00:23:27.428 --> 00:23:28.970
Dude is rocking
a cassette player.


496
00:23:29.054 --> 00:23:30.930
Just relax.
I'm sure there's a reasonable explanation


497
00:23:31.056 --> 00:23:32.348
- for all this shit.
- Don't fucking tell me to relax.


498
00:23:32.433 --> 00:23:33.766
I said relax
for a minute.


499
00:23:33.851 --> 00:23:35.268
Leg warmers?

500
00:23:35.519 --> 00:23:36.894
Jheri curl?

501
00:23:36.979 --> 00:23:38.354
"Where's the beef?"

502
00:23:38.439 --> 00:23:41.566
Excuse me, miss,
what color is Michael Jackson?


503
00:23:42.234 --> 00:23:43.484
Black.

504
00:23:48.449 --> 00:23:50.950
Hold on! Sorry.
Excuse me. Sorry.


505
00:23:52.619 --> 00:23:53.619
Nick, come on, man!
Nick! Nick!


506
00:23:54.788 --> 00:23:55.872
Who the fuck is that?

507
00:23:55.956 --> 00:23:57.206
That's probably
Ashton Kolchak right now


508
00:23:57.291 --> 00:23:59.375
telling us we've been
punked or whatever.


509
00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:01.252
- Okay.
- Come on. Come on.


510
00:24:05.549 --> 00:24:08.009
Hey. Hey, guys.
I've got your luggage.


511
00:24:08.552 --> 00:24:10.762
He's got both arms.
Get him!


512
00:24:14.808 --> 00:24:16.684
- What?
- Check his arm.


513
00:24:16.769 --> 00:24:18.811
- Are you raping?
- Wait! Hold on! Are we raping him?


514
00:24:18.896 --> 00:24:20.063
Nobody's raping anybody!

515
00:24:20.147 --> 00:24:21.856
Where's your missing arm,
motherfucker?


516
00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:24.233
Hey! God!
That's my arm!


517
00:24:24.318 --> 00:24:25.818
- It's fake!
- It's real!


518
00:24:25.903 --> 00:24:28.404
It's got freckles on it
and shit!


519
00:24:37.164 --> 00:24:39.040
Do I really got to be
the asshole that says


520
00:24:39.124 --> 00:24:41.626
we got in this thing
and went back in time?


521
00:24:41.710 --> 00:24:44.962
It must be some kind of
hot tub time machine.


522
00:24:47.966 --> 00:24:49.425
Wow, my old stuff.

523
00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:50.885
Look at this shit, man.

524
00:24:50.969 --> 00:24:52.053
You have a bong?

525
00:24:52.137 --> 00:24:53.221
I did.

526
00:24:53.305 --> 00:24:55.556
"Eddie Lives."
This shirt got me so much fucking pussy.


527
00:24:55.641 --> 00:24:56.808
You wanna see
what got a lot of pussy?


528
00:24:56.892 --> 00:24:57.975
What's the tape recorder for?

529
00:24:58.060 --> 00:24:59.185
- Recording tape.
- I gotta take a piss.


530
00:24:59.311 --> 00:25:00.728
- This jacket right here, baby.
- Holy fuck!


531
00:25:00.813 --> 00:25:02.105
What are you,
Hunter S. Thompson?


532
00:25:02.189 --> 00:25:04.190
- I thought I was.
- Is that coke?


533
00:25:04.274 --> 00:25:06.192
What the fuck you think it is?
Baby powder?


534
00:25:06.276 --> 00:25:07.360
Wait. How is this happening?

535
00:25:07.444 --> 00:25:10.405
Can we talk about this
for a minute?


536
00:25:14.326 --> 00:25:17.703
Holy fuck! Winterfest '86.
We were here, man.


537
00:25:17.788 --> 00:25:19.163
- Guys.
- We are here.


538
00:25:19.248 --> 00:25:20.331
What if we run into ourselves?

539
00:25:20.416 --> 00:25:21.457
Guys!

540
00:25:21.542 --> 00:25:24.752
We see ourselves and we blow up
and explode or some shit.


541
00:25:24.837 --> 00:25:25.920
Get in here!

542
00:25:26.004 --> 00:25:27.171
Didn't you all fucking see Timecop?

543
00:25:27.256 --> 00:25:29.173
God damn it!
Get the fuck in here right now!


544
00:25:29.258 --> 00:25:31.134
Nobody wants to see
your giant shit, Lou.


545
00:25:31.218 --> 00:25:32.677
What, man?

546
00:25:44.106 --> 00:25:46.649
Yeah, we're not gonna
run into ourselves.


547
00:25:46.733 --> 00:25:47.859
We are ourselves.

548
00:25:47.943 --> 00:25:50.570
Why are we in our young bodies
and you in your regular body?


549
00:25:50.654 --> 00:25:51.612
I don't know.

550
00:25:51.697 --> 00:25:52.864
Shouldn't you be invisible?

551
00:25:52.948 --> 00:25:54.532
Or swimming around
some guy's ball sack?


552
00:25:54.616 --> 00:25:57.785
I know.
Because you guys exist here and I don't.


553
00:25:58.954 --> 00:26:00.955
Hey, why are you flickering?

554
00:26:01.039 --> 00:26:02.457
- What?
- What? What? Who flickered?


555
00:26:02.541 --> 00:26:04.333
- He did.
- He's flickering.


556
00:26:04.418 --> 00:26:05.793
I need you to touch
my arm or something


557
00:26:05.878 --> 00:26:06.961
to see if I'm
still real, okay?


558
00:26:07.045 --> 00:26:10.047
Just see if you can put
your hand through me.


559
00:26:12.593 --> 00:26:13.759
Okay.

560
00:26:14.178 --> 00:26:15.428
That's good.

561
00:26:15.512 --> 00:26:19.265
I'm physically still here.
That's good, I think.


562
00:26:20.976 --> 00:26:22.560
You look like Kid 'N Play.

563
00:26:22.644 --> 00:26:24.770
That's actually two people.

564
00:26:27.399 --> 00:26:29.108
I knew this trip
was a bad idea.


565
00:26:29.193 --> 00:26:31.652
Every time I hang out with you,
man, it's some kind of shit storm.


566
00:26:31.737 --> 00:26:33.279
I got guilted into
coming on this trip


567
00:26:33.363 --> 00:26:34.822
and now I'm back
in the fucking '80s.


568
00:26:34.907 --> 00:26:35.990
And I hate this decade!

569
00:26:36.074 --> 00:26:37.492
Maybe it's your
fucking fault!


570
00:26:37.576 --> 00:26:40.244
You're a fucking insurance salesman,
you're practically the devil.


571
00:26:40.329 --> 00:26:42.538
Guys! This is
scientifically possible.


572
00:26:42.623 --> 00:26:46.083
Oh, my God. Okay, Professor Hawking,
tell me in your robot voice


573
00:26:46.168 --> 00:26:47.835
how this is
scientifically possible.


574
00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:49.629
<i>All right,</i>
I write Stargate fan fiction,


575
00:26:49.713 --> 00:26:51.547
so I think I know
what I'm talking about right now.


576
00:26:51.632 --> 00:26:54.217
I seriously almost passed out,
you're such a dork.


577
00:26:54.301 --> 00:26:56.969
Okay. The tub is obviously
some kind of energy vortex, right?


578
00:26:57.054 --> 00:26:58.095
Like a black hole.

579
00:26:58.180 --> 00:27:00.264
But, instead of
being in space,


580
00:27:01.308 --> 00:27:02.975
it's in a hot tub.

581
00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:05.978
Time is not linear,
we just perceive it that way!


582
00:27:06.104 --> 00:27:07.813
<i>- What?</i>
- Like The Terminator!


583
00:27:07.898 --> 00:27:09.857
It's cyclical, right?

584
00:27:09.942 --> 00:27:12.568
The machines send Schwarzenegger
back to kill Sarah Connor


585
00:27:12.653 --> 00:27:14.529
so that John Connor
could never be born.


586
00:27:14.613 --> 00:27:17.448
But if John Connor don't send
Michael Biehn back to protect her,


587
00:27:17.533 --> 00:27:21.786
then they never fuck, and John Connor
ain't born in the first place!


588
00:27:22.287 --> 00:27:23.871
- It checks out.
- Yeah, that's pretty good.


589
00:27:23.956 --> 00:27:26.541
Wait, wait, check the fucking drawer.
See if the carving's there.


590
00:27:26.625 --> 00:27:28.793
Check the fucking drawer.

591
00:27:29.711 --> 00:27:31.128
Fuck!

592
00:27:33.423 --> 00:27:34.423
It's gone.

593
00:27:35.634 --> 00:27:36.676
This shit is real.

594
00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:38.970
The carving you
made 20 years ago,


595
00:27:39.054 --> 00:27:40.972
about me sucking
cocks and dicks,


596
00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:44.141
- it's not there.
- Wait.


597
00:27:44.768 --> 00:27:45.935
Is "cocks" still there?

598
00:27:46.019 --> 00:27:47.478
Nothing.
I mean, it's not there.


599
00:27:47.563 --> 00:27:48.646
What about "dicks"?

600
00:27:48.730 --> 00:27:51.357
Neither "cocks,"
nor "dicks," nor "sucks."


601
00:27:51.441 --> 00:27:52.984
Oh, God!

602
00:27:53.485 --> 00:27:56.862
That's it.
We stuck in the fucking '80s!


603
00:27:57.406 --> 00:27:59.782
How am I supposed
to get a job?


604
00:28:00.325 --> 00:28:01.951
I'm so scared.

605
00:28:03.704 --> 00:28:05.413
Looks like you
burned out your...


606
00:28:05.497 --> 00:28:08.249
Heck, you fried
your timing crossover.


607
00:28:10.085 --> 00:28:11.294
Would you mind
putting that down, sir,


608
00:28:11.378 --> 00:28:14.505
that coal shovel,
before somebody gets hurt?


609
00:28:15.549 --> 00:28:17.049
Did somebody call you?

610
00:28:17.134 --> 00:28:18.592
Excuse me one minute.

611
00:28:24.057 --> 00:28:25.725
Who ever calls us?

612
00:28:26.893 --> 00:28:29.812
And who answers when the call comes
from within? Huh?


613
00:28:31.356 --> 00:28:35.735
I thought maybe I could pull the part
from one of the other tubs.


614
00:28:35.819 --> 00:28:39.280
But it turns out this is
a very special model that you have here.


615
00:28:39.364 --> 00:28:41.657
You've got to be
very careful, I tell you.


616
00:28:41.742 --> 00:28:46.495
One little thing is changed,
the whole system can go haywire.


617
00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:48.539
Do you understand
what I'm saying?


618
00:28:48.623 --> 00:28:50.750
The whole system
can go haywire


619
00:28:50.834 --> 00:28:53.085
if you change
one little thing.


620
00:28:53.503 --> 00:28:56.422
Wait a minute.
We need that to get back in time?


621
00:28:56.506 --> 00:28:57.548
Well, you're back here.

622
00:28:57.632 --> 00:29:01.344
I mean, I can tell you've all been
to Kodiak Valley before.


623
00:29:01.428 --> 00:29:02.887
- I haven't.
- Maybe not her,


624
00:29:02.971 --> 00:29:05.473
but I know that
you were here.


625
00:29:05.557 --> 00:29:08.100
You know what's
going on here, don't you, old man?


626
00:29:08.185 --> 00:29:09.393
Yes, I do.

627
00:29:09.478 --> 00:29:12.313
Your tub is on the fritz.
It'd behoove you to fix it.


628
00:29:13.523 --> 00:29:14.732
What?

629
00:29:14.858 --> 00:29:16.400
It's working.

630
00:29:19.905 --> 00:29:21.781
Damn.
I think it's still broke.


631
00:29:21.865 --> 00:29:22.948
Shit.

632
00:29:24.451 --> 00:29:25.493
Where'd he go?

633
00:29:25.577 --> 00:29:27.370
That motherfucker's
in on it, man.


634
00:29:27.454 --> 00:29:29.121
What was all that
cryptic shit he was saying


635
00:29:29.206 --> 00:29:30.331
about not changing
one little thing?


636
00:29:30.415 --> 00:29:32.833
I know exactly what he meant.
He was talking about the butterfly effect.


637
00:29:32.918 --> 00:29:34.335
That was
a great fucking movie.


638
00:29:34.419 --> 00:29:36.879
One little change
has a ripple effect


639
00:29:36.963 --> 00:29:38.339
and it affects
everything else.


640
00:29:38.423 --> 00:29:40.341
Like, a butterfly
floats its wings


641
00:29:40.425 --> 00:29:44.011
and Tokyo explodes, or there's
a tsunami in, like, somewhere.


642
00:29:44.096 --> 00:29:46.097
Dude, yes, exactly.
Or you step on a bug


643
00:29:46.181 --> 00:29:48.140
and the fucking
Internet's never invented.


644
00:29:48.225 --> 00:29:50.684
Then you have to talk
to girls with your mouth.


645
00:29:50.769 --> 00:29:53.187
Yeah. I was more concerned
about bigger consequences,


646
00:29:53.271 --> 00:29:54.522
like me not being born.

647
00:29:54.606 --> 00:29:56.023
Oh, yeah.
No, I don't care about that.


648
00:29:56.108 --> 00:29:58.526
The point is,
what did we do 20 years ago?


649
00:29:58.610 --> 00:29:59.860
Let's figure it
out right now.


650
00:29:59.945 --> 00:30:02.738
We gotta do
the exact same thing.


651
00:30:02.823 --> 00:30:04.532
- I had that gig.
- That's right.


652
00:30:04.616 --> 00:30:07.785
You got up on stage
and you were wildly mediocre.


653
00:30:07.869 --> 00:30:09.203
And that led to
nothing of a career.


654
00:30:09.287 --> 00:30:11.831
Okay, first of all,
fuck you, motherfucker!


655
00:30:11.915 --> 00:30:15.042
I could have had a career,
but I got married and I went a different way.


656
00:30:15.168 --> 00:30:16.544
Which way is that?
The way that sucked?


657
00:30:16.628 --> 00:30:18.003
Didn't you also
bang that groupie?


658
00:30:18.088 --> 00:30:19.755
- What was her name?
- Tara.


659
00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:22.550
You banged her.
You got to go do that again.


660
00:30:22.634 --> 00:30:25.970
I did do that.
But, fuck, no, I'm married!


661
00:30:26.304 --> 00:30:27.847
I can't go around
banging girls in hot tubs.


662
00:30:27.931 --> 00:30:31.308
Nick, it's 1986. You can't cheat
on someone you don't know yet.


663
00:30:31.393 --> 00:30:33.644
You haven't
even met Courtney.


664
00:30:33.728 --> 00:30:35.896
Lucifer,
itinerary please.


665
00:30:35.981 --> 00:30:36.981
Uh... Nothing
really happened.


666
00:30:37.065 --> 00:30:38.858
I actually fucked a chick, too.
So I'll just do that.


667
00:30:38.942 --> 00:30:41.152
I seem to remember
you getting your ass whooped.


668
00:30:42.362 --> 00:30:43.904
- Oh, yeah.
- That's right.


669
00:30:43.989 --> 00:30:46.824
That ski patrol dude
pummeled you like it was his job.


670
00:30:46.908 --> 00:30:47.992
Yeah, no.
I don't remember it that way.


671
00:30:48.076 --> 00:30:49.118
I do.

672
00:30:49.202 --> 00:30:51.704
Yeah. He fucked you up.
You cried and peed.


673
00:30:51.788 --> 00:30:54.748
Fuck this, man!
This is fucking bullshit!


674
00:30:54.833 --> 00:30:56.834
Would you just think of somebody
other than yourself, man?


675
00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:57.960
There's four of us.

676
00:30:58.044 --> 00:30:59.962
It's the fucking '80s, guys!

677
00:31:00.046 --> 00:31:02.756
Let's do what we wanna do.
Free love!


678
00:31:02.841 --> 00:31:04.508
That's
the '60s, dipshit.


679
00:31:04.593 --> 00:31:06.552
No, we had, like,
Reagan and AIDS.


680
00:31:06.636 --> 00:31:08.512
Let's get the fuck
out of here, okay?


681
00:31:08.597 --> 00:31:09.930
Do the right thing, Violator.

682
00:31:10.015 --> 00:31:12.850
God damn it!
This is fucking bullshit!


683
00:31:12.934 --> 00:31:14.935
Tonight's the night
you broke up with Jenny Stedmeyer.


684
00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:16.228
- Shit.
- Yeah, you got stabbed


685
00:31:16.313 --> 00:31:18.272
in the fucking
eyeball tonight!


686
00:31:18.857 --> 00:31:21.025
Hey, man,
do you want backup?


687
00:31:21.109 --> 00:31:22.568
I can't, the butterflies
won't let me.


688
00:31:22.694 --> 00:31:24.069
Yo, Adam?
You guys in there?


689
00:31:24.154 --> 00:31:25.362
Oh, shit.

690
00:31:28.241 --> 00:31:30.326
There you are. Hey!

691
00:31:30.410 --> 00:31:32.912
How come you guys didn't meet us at
the chair lift this morning?


692
00:31:32.996 --> 00:31:34.121
You were going to
show me some moves.


693
00:31:34.206 --> 00:31:36.665
Hi, baby.
I missed you.


694
00:31:39.169 --> 00:31:40.753
I must have forgot.

695
00:31:40.837 --> 00:31:42.880
Perv. That's from Mandy.

696
00:31:43.256 --> 00:31:44.757
- Hey, new guy. What's up?
- Hey.


697
00:31:44.841 --> 00:31:47.218
So we're in 214.
I'm gonna go get ready.


698
00:31:47.302 --> 00:31:48.594
- Okay.
- Meet me in my room, okay?


699
00:31:48.678 --> 00:31:50.095
- Okay.
- Okay.


700
00:31:50.388 --> 00:31:52.306
Love the PJs, Nick.
You look hot.


701
00:31:54.351 --> 00:31:56.227
Poison's tonight.

702
00:31:56.311 --> 00:31:57.436
Wow!

703
00:31:57.521 --> 00:31:59.313
I don't remember her
being that fucking beautiful.


704
00:31:59.397 --> 00:32:02.983
And tight.
She's so tight.


705
00:32:03.068 --> 00:32:04.151
She's really
fucking tight!


706
00:32:04.236 --> 00:32:05.569
She's the great
white buffalo, man.


707
00:32:05.654 --> 00:32:06.904
- Great white buffalo.
- Great white buffalo.


708
00:32:06.988 --> 00:32:08.614
Don't start that.

709
00:32:08.698 --> 00:32:10.157
- Great white buffalo.
- Great white buffalo.


710
00:32:10.242 --> 00:32:11.200
Why did I ever break up with her?

711
00:32:11.284 --> 00:32:12.326
Why would I
break up with her?


712
00:32:12.410 --> 00:32:13.410
Doesn't matter.
Doesn't matter.


713
00:32:13.495 --> 00:32:15.162
'Cause you have to
do it again. Right?


714
00:32:15.247 --> 00:32:16.872
Right, right, right.

715
00:32:16.957 --> 00:32:18.249
All right. We're
all gonna meet back here.


716
00:32:18.333 --> 00:32:20.417
Hopefully that hot tub's fixed
and we can get the fuck out of here.


717
00:32:20.502 --> 00:32:22.002
Okay, let's party
like it's 1986.


718
00:32:22.087 --> 00:32:23.212
All right. On three?

719
00:32:23.296 --> 00:32:24.296
- One, two, three...
- One, two, three...


720
00:32:24.381 --> 00:32:26.131
- Hot tub time machine!
- Wait...


721
00:32:26.216 --> 00:32:27.216
What are we...
What's the...


722
00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:28.300
Who said,
"Hot tub time machine?"


723
00:32:28.385 --> 00:32:29.552
We didn't tell you
about the new thing, with our hands?


724
00:32:29.636 --> 00:32:31.136
- No.
- On three, we always...


725
00:32:31.221 --> 00:32:32.513
From now on,
we're gonna say, "Hot tub time machine."


726
00:32:32.597 --> 00:32:33.847
I told you, I think
that's fucking stupid.


727
00:32:33.932 --> 00:32:34.932
You were in
the bathroom.


728
00:32:35.016 --> 00:32:36.016
No, but this is a real
bonding event for us.


729
00:32:36.101 --> 00:32:37.101
This doesn't happen
all the time.


730
00:32:37.185 --> 00:32:38.561
- Come on.
- I'm telling you, it's stupid.


731
00:32:38.645 --> 00:32:39.853
- Do it once.
- Do what you want to do.


732
00:32:39.938 --> 00:32:41.146
It would have been

733
00:32:41.231 --> 00:32:42.523
One, two, three...

734
00:32:42.607 --> 00:32:43.691
...hot tub time machine!

735
00:32:43.775 --> 00:32:44.942
It felt good. Admit it.

736
00:32:55.912 --> 00:32:57.121
Hey!

737
00:32:58.582 --> 00:33:00.874
Let's get
this party started!


738
00:33:01.501 --> 00:33:03.627
Who is carrying
me home tonight?


739
00:33:04.087 --> 00:33:05.129
Mom?

740
00:33:05.213 --> 00:33:06.672
Sweet fucking Lord.

741
00:33:06.756 --> 00:33:07.840
Kelly.

742
00:33:07.924 --> 00:33:09.049
Hey, bro, Nicholas.

743
00:33:09.134 --> 00:33:10.175
Hey, girl.

744
00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:11.260
Who's the geek?

745
00:33:11.344 --> 00:33:12.386
He's your son.

746
00:33:13.513 --> 00:33:15.180
That's not appropriate.

747
00:33:15.265 --> 00:33:16.640
I'm sun...
Sunshine.


748
00:33:16.725 --> 00:33:17.766
Sunshine.

749
00:33:17.851 --> 00:33:18.892
'Cause I'm here to
brighten your day.


750
00:33:18.977 --> 00:33:21.312
That's Jacob.
Your...


751
00:33:21.646 --> 00:33:22.938
He's totally cool.

752
00:33:23.023 --> 00:33:24.023
He doesn't look cool.

753
00:33:24.107 --> 00:33:27.067
He's not that cool.
Hey, Kelly.


754
00:33:27.152 --> 00:33:29.111
Lou Dorchen. Yeah...

755
00:33:29.195 --> 00:33:30.237
You don't remember this?

756
00:33:30.322 --> 00:33:31.280
I don't remember everything.

757
00:33:31.364 --> 00:33:33.324
What the fuck, man?
This is freaking me the fuck out.


758
00:33:33.408 --> 00:33:34.867
You freak out every time
you leave the basement.


759
00:33:34.951 --> 00:33:36.118
All right, kiddies,
get your snow boots on


760
00:33:36.202 --> 00:33:38.495
because tonight
there is gonna be a blizzard.


761
00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:40.247
Really? It looked
pretty clear out.


762
00:33:40.332 --> 00:33:42.541
Anybody wanna go
for a little sleigh ride?


763
00:33:42.626 --> 00:33:46.128
You can't do cocaine!
It's so unhealthy for you.


764
00:33:46.212 --> 00:33:47.421
Kelly, in public?

765
00:33:47.505 --> 00:33:48.547
Whatever.

766
00:33:48.632 --> 00:33:50.257
I'm gonna go to a party
at the ski patrol house,


767
00:33:50.342 --> 00:33:51.800
I'm gonna find
a sexy instructor


768
00:33:51.885 --> 00:33:54.345
and I'm gonna wax
his fucking pole.


769
00:33:54.429 --> 00:33:56.847
Later, homos.
Don't drink my fucking drink.


770
00:33:56.931 --> 00:33:58.015
Ugh!

771
00:33:59.309 --> 00:34:00.267
Hey, Adam?

772
00:34:00.352 --> 00:34:03.729
What she means is that she works
at the ski rental place, right?


773
00:34:03.813 --> 00:34:05.981
And that's her job,
is cleaning the poles.


774
00:34:06.066 --> 00:34:08.567
I could be off, but I think
it's in reference to blowing a dude.


775
00:34:08.652 --> 00:34:11.612
Thank you, Nick.
But that's... You don't need to...


776
00:34:11.696 --> 00:34:13.113
Or fucking a dude.
Because the wax,


777
00:34:13.198 --> 00:34:15.366
it can be interpreted
either way.


778
00:34:15.450 --> 00:34:17.785
She was a free spirit,
you know?


779
00:34:17.869 --> 00:34:21.705
Or maybe she's the pole and there's
two dudes that she's waxing.


780
00:34:21.790 --> 00:34:24.416
Let's justget it done, man.
Come on.


781
00:34:25.126 --> 00:34:26.293
- Hey, Lou.
- What?


782
00:34:26.378 --> 00:34:29.296
Did my mom, like,
sleep with a bunch of dudes?


783
00:34:29.381 --> 00:34:30.381
I don't know.
Shut up.


784
00:34:30.465 --> 00:34:31.840
But she seems
kind of slutty, right?


785
00:34:31.925 --> 00:34:34.218
Does she seem
that way to you?


786
00:34:34.302 --> 00:34:36.136
It's just, she never
told me who my dad is.


787
00:34:36.221 --> 00:34:37.638
It could be any
one of these guys.


788
00:34:37.722 --> 00:34:39.765
'Cause I was born, like,
nine months from now.


789
00:34:39.849 --> 00:34:41.433
Yeah?
So what does
that mean?


790
00:34:41.518 --> 00:34:42.810
It means do the math,
dipshit.


791
00:34:42.894 --> 00:34:44.937
I could have been
conceived this weekend.


792
00:34:45.063 --> 00:34:46.730
Oh, shit.
Check this out.


793
00:34:46.815 --> 00:34:49.817
That's that fucking bellhop.
I hate that guy.


794
00:34:51.069 --> 00:34:53.737
This must be where
he loses the arm!


795
00:34:56.866 --> 00:34:58.617
- Shit!
- Thank you!


796
00:34:58.702 --> 00:35:00.411
I think
we should tell him.
This is gruesome.


797
00:35:00.495 --> 00:35:01.495
Don't you dare
fucking tell him.


798
00:35:01.579 --> 00:35:04.415
You'll screw
the time thing up.


799
00:35:16.970 --> 00:35:18.011
Yeah!

800
00:35:19.139 --> 00:35:20.139
Yes!

801
00:35:20.223 --> 00:35:21.265
What the fuck?

802
00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:23.267
Yeah!

803
00:35:24.644 --> 00:35:27.938
Boo! We just got fucking robbed.

804
00:35:28.022 --> 00:35:29.148
What are you talking about?

805
00:35:29.232 --> 00:35:30.399
- He's great, man.
- Come on!


806
00:35:31.276 --> 00:35:32.526
Jenny.

807
00:35:34.028 --> 00:35:35.028
Jenny?

808
00:35:35.113 --> 00:35:36.947
I'm in the bathroom.
Come in.


809
00:35:37.907 --> 00:35:39.450
What do you think?

810
00:35:39.534 --> 00:35:41.034
Oh, my God.

811
00:35:41.119 --> 00:35:42.995
What? Do I look fat?

812
00:35:43.788 --> 00:35:46.290
No. You look
really beautiful.


813
00:35:47.917 --> 00:35:50.544
Aw! Thank you.

814
00:35:53.423 --> 00:35:54.882
How about me,
do I look different?


815
00:35:54.966 --> 00:35:56.633
Do I look kind of older?

816
00:35:57.343 --> 00:35:58.510
No.

817
00:35:59.429 --> 00:36:01.305
You look cute, though.

818
00:36:01.639 --> 00:36:03.390
God, I can't stop
thinking about last night.


819
00:36:03.475 --> 00:36:05.684
It was like frigging hot.

820
00:36:05.769 --> 00:36:08.604
It was? What did we do?
I don't remember.


821
00:36:08.938 --> 00:36:11.774
You lasted,
like, 10 minutes.


822
00:36:12.066 --> 00:36:13.233
Oh!

823
00:36:13.401 --> 00:36:14.818
Good, good.

824
00:36:15.236 --> 00:36:16.403
And I was good.

825
00:36:16.488 --> 00:36:20.574
I think I came. I think.
I can't even tell you what it was like.


826
00:36:20.658 --> 00:36:23.368
I got some vague
recollection of that.


827
00:36:23.995 --> 00:36:25.579
Wanna maybe just sit
and talk for a minute?


828
00:36:25.663 --> 00:36:26.955
"Talk."

829
00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:31.084
Well, I mean, you know,
it's just so good to see you again.


830
00:36:35.048 --> 00:36:37.007
It's not you. It's me.

831
00:36:41.846 --> 00:36:43.096
Lamp.

832
00:36:43.681 --> 00:36:46.308
You know what,
I think we should go to Poison now.


833
00:36:46.392 --> 00:36:47.601
You're weird today.

834
00:36:47.685 --> 00:36:49.436
I know.
You are funny.


835
00:36:49.521 --> 00:36:50.479
Let me just get dressed.

836
00:36:50.563 --> 00:36:52.105
Okay.

837
00:36:53.650 --> 00:36:54.650
Wow!

838
00:36:58.947 --> 00:37:00.239
Oh, man!

839
00:37:00.782 --> 00:37:02.282
This is trippy.

840
00:37:02.367 --> 00:37:03.951
What's up?

841
00:37:04.202 --> 00:37:07.830
Man, I can't even remember
the last time I saw you guys.


842
00:37:08.581 --> 00:37:09.957
Yesterday.

843
00:37:10.792 --> 00:37:12.960
Oh, yeah. Yesterday.

844
00:37:15.672 --> 00:37:16.755
Yep.

845
00:37:21.886 --> 00:37:25.389
It's not cheating.It's not cheating.
It's 1986.


846
00:37:25.515 --> 00:37:26.932
You don't even
know Courtney yet.


847
00:37:29.227 --> 00:37:30.811
You know, it's okay
if you're scared, Lou.


848
00:37:30.895 --> 00:37:33.397
I'm not scared, idiot.
I'm fucking pissed.


849
00:37:33.481 --> 00:37:35.148
I have a full head of hair
and a functioning penis,


850
00:37:35.233 --> 00:37:37.401
and I'm looking for some guy
to drill me in the fucking jaw.


851
00:37:37.485 --> 00:37:38.986
We're not gonna
find him here, anyway.


852
00:37:39.070 --> 00:37:40.362
I don't even remember
what he looks like.


853
00:37:45.076 --> 00:37:46.660
- Walk much, faggot?
- Sorry.


854
00:37:46.744 --> 00:37:48.328
What? No, don't touch me.
The fuck, you're sorry.


855
00:37:48.413 --> 00:37:50.372
You scuffed up my Jordans.

856
00:37:51.416 --> 00:37:54.793
You wanna go for it?
Come on, take a shot, pussy. Wanna party?


857
00:37:54.878 --> 00:37:56.753
Wanna be a hero?

858
00:37:56.921 --> 00:37:59.047
And here it comes.

859
00:38:02.802 --> 00:38:06.221
Yeah, you gonna cry?
You gonna cry, titty baby?


860
00:38:06.306 --> 00:38:09.850
You gonna fucking cry?
Look at him he's crying.


861
00:38:09.934 --> 00:38:12.144
Your fucking bag
is mine now.


862
00:38:12.896 --> 00:38:14.271
Is that it?

863
00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:15.898
No.

864
00:38:15.982 --> 00:38:17.733
No, I yell back at him

865
00:38:17.817 --> 00:38:19.651
and I challenge him to
a rematch at midnight saying,


866
00:38:19.736 --> 00:38:21.111
"You bring your friends
and I'll bring mine."


867
00:38:21.195 --> 00:38:22.654
And my friends
don't fucking show up.


868
00:38:22.739 --> 00:38:24.907
So I get pummeled
by six guys instead of one.


869
00:38:24.991 --> 00:38:27.618
All right, fantastic.
Let's do this.


870
00:38:29.454 --> 00:38:31.622
Lou, come on.
You have to.


871
00:38:33.958 --> 00:38:35.459
Hey, Blaine.

872
00:38:36.127 --> 00:38:38.670
Is that all you got?
Pussy.


873
00:38:41.924 --> 00:38:44.468
Oh, God. Yeah.

874
00:38:45.595 --> 00:38:48.221
I'll never go back.
I'll never go back.


875
00:38:50.391 --> 00:38:51.975
Are you crying?

876
00:38:52.477 --> 00:38:53.644
No.

877
00:38:53.728 --> 00:38:56.146
It's the water splashing my face
from all the fucking.


878
00:38:56.814 --> 00:38:57.981
Okay, good.

879
00:38:58.358 --> 00:39:01.652
Because I thought
you were crying, and I was like...


880
00:39:01.944 --> 00:39:03.070
Yeah!

881
00:39:03.154 --> 00:39:04.655
I'm sorry, Courtney.

882
00:39:04.739 --> 00:39:06.531
- It's Tara.
- Courtney!


883
00:39:06.616 --> 00:39:07.574
Tara. Tara.

884
00:39:07.659 --> 00:39:09.076
Courtney! Courtney!

885
00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:11.578
No, seriously,
my name is Tara.


886
00:39:11.829 --> 00:39:13.997
No, my wife, my wife.

887
00:39:15.333 --> 00:39:16.333
You're married?

888
00:39:16.501 --> 00:39:18.877
No, I'm not married.
Not now, anyway.


889
00:39:18.961 --> 00:39:21.630
I will be.
She's nine right now.


890
00:39:27.261 --> 00:39:30.347
Can I tell you something
that I haven't told anybody?


891
00:39:30.848 --> 00:39:32.474
She cheated on me.

892
00:39:34.185 --> 00:39:35.936
I found a e-mail.

893
00:39:36.521 --> 00:39:38.438
And now every time
I look at her,


894
00:39:38.523 --> 00:39:40.607
all I can see is
her getting rammed by


895
00:39:40.692 --> 00:39:43.944
some faceless dude
with a better body and a bigger dick.


896
00:39:44.028 --> 00:39:46.446
Truth of it is, I can't even
bring myself to say anything


897
00:39:46.531 --> 00:39:49.199
because I just love
her so fucking much.


898
00:39:50.535 --> 00:39:53.453
I don't even know if I can
live without her cheating ass.


899
00:39:53.538 --> 00:39:55.122
Hey, what's an e-mail?

900
00:39:55.206 --> 00:39:56.957
That's not the point!

901
00:39:57.709 --> 00:40:00.794
Seems like you might've took one
defensive swing against him.


902
00:40:00.878 --> 00:40:03.964
I mean, honestly, what the fuck, man?
That was...


903
00:40:04.048 --> 00:40:07.300
I don't know how you've
lived with yourself all these years.


904
00:40:07.385 --> 00:40:08.969
It was pathetic.

905
00:40:09.053 --> 00:40:11.638
It was pathetic.
You couldn't have kicked him from the ground?


906
00:40:11.723 --> 00:40:13.223
What happened?

907
00:40:16.310 --> 00:40:17.394
Uh...

908
00:40:17.979 --> 00:40:20.814
This is a crazy story.
I got hit by a truck.


909
00:40:21.315 --> 00:40:22.899
Yeah, yeah.

910
00:40:22.984 --> 00:40:25.527
Trying to save a baby deer,
if you can believe that.


911
00:40:25.611 --> 00:40:26.695
Oh, my God!

912
00:40:26.779 --> 00:40:29.072
Is there anything
that I can do?
Are you okay?


913
00:40:30.950 --> 00:40:34.035
Oh, my God.
No, I'm fine. This is nothing.


914
00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:36.496
You know what? Come with me.
I'm gonna take care of you.


915
00:40:36.581 --> 00:40:37.914
And bring your friend.

916
00:40:37.999 --> 00:40:39.082
No, we can't.

917
00:40:39.125 --> 00:40:40.834
- We'd love to, but we can't.
- We can, we can.


918
00:40:40.918 --> 00:40:42.794
We should probably go check
on that deer, actually.


919
00:40:42.879 --> 00:40:43.920
No, we can go.
We can go.


920
00:40:45.798 --> 00:40:48.008
¢Ü I know you cannot wait ¢Ü

921
00:40:48.092 --> 00:40:50.135
¢Ü Wait to see me, too ¢Ü

922
00:40:50.219 --> 00:40:51.428
Oh, my God!

923
00:40:51.512 --> 00:40:53.680
This is like
the best song ever!


924
00:40:53.765 --> 00:40:54.931
Maybe not ever.

925
00:40:56.476 --> 00:40:58.143
¢Ü At the drive-in ¢Ü

926
00:40:58.227 --> 00:40:59.853
God, he's so hot!

927
00:40:59.937 --> 00:41:02.189
¢ÜIn the old man's Ford ¢Ü

928
00:41:02.273 --> 00:41:04.733
¢Ü Behind the bushes ¢Ü

929
00:41:04.901 --> 00:41:06.359
Can I get 3,000 beers?

930
00:41:06.444 --> 00:41:08.403
¢Ü Until I'm screaming for more ¢Ü

931
00:41:08.488 --> 00:41:10.614
¢Ü Down the basement ¢Ü

932
00:41:12.450 --> 00:41:14.534
Who's next?
Who's next for the beer luge?


933
00:41:14.619 --> 00:41:16.870
This guy! This guy's next!
He wants it so bad.


934
00:41:16.954 --> 00:41:17.954
You can do it, man.

935
00:41:18.039 --> 00:41:19.206
He wants it.

936
00:41:21.959 --> 00:41:24.586
Luge! Luge! Luge!
Luge! Luge! Luge!


937
00:41:28.341 --> 00:41:32.511
That was so lame. That wasn't, like,
even violent a little bit.


938
00:41:32.595 --> 00:41:34.387
Who are you, and why did you
do that to me?


939
00:41:34.472 --> 00:41:37.432
Why? Because you looked
like you needed a luge.


940
00:41:37.517 --> 00:41:39.559
- I'm Adam.
- I'm April.


941
00:41:39.644 --> 00:41:40.644
How are you doing?

942
00:41:40.728 --> 00:41:41.895
All right.

943
00:41:41.979 --> 00:41:43.563
What brings you here?

944
00:41:43.648 --> 00:41:44.689
Hot tub.

945
00:41:44.774 --> 00:41:45.774
Huh.

946
00:41:45.858 --> 00:41:47.609
- You?
- Poison.


947
00:41:48.194 --> 00:41:49.986
- Right.
- That band. Poison.


948
00:41:50.154 --> 00:41:53.198
<i>I'm a journalist.
I'm covering the band for Spin magazine.</i>


949
00:41:53.282 --> 00:41:54.741
You don't really look
like you're the type.


950
00:41:54.826 --> 00:41:57.744
The Poison type?
God, no. I'm not. I'm really not.


951
00:41:57.829 --> 00:41:59.913
I basically just
got onto this bus


952
00:41:59.997 --> 00:42:03.959
and it took me here,
to goddamn Winterfest.


953
00:42:04.210 --> 00:42:05.669
Adam!

954
00:42:06.379 --> 00:42:07.504
Whoo!

955
00:42:07.964 --> 00:42:09.714
You know what?
I can't talk to you.


956
00:42:09.799 --> 00:42:10.882
You can't?

957
00:42:10.967 --> 00:42:12.634
But I'm awesome.
I can guarantee that.


958
00:42:12.718 --> 00:42:15.387
I'm sure. You see, I have to walk
in the exact same footsteps.


959
00:42:15.471 --> 00:42:17.264
This didn't happen.

960
00:42:17.348 --> 00:42:18.974
Well, it kind of happened.

961
00:42:19.058 --> 00:42:20.100
I wish it did.

962
00:42:20.184 --> 00:42:21.768
- I just saw it happen.
- It really didn't.


963
00:42:21.853 --> 00:42:23.645
Yeah. No, I contributed.

964
00:42:23.729 --> 00:42:24.896
I wish it did.

965
00:42:24.981 --> 00:42:26.064
All right.

966
00:42:26.691 --> 00:42:27.691
See you.

967
00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:36.324
I brought you some ice.
It'll make you feel better.


968
00:42:36.492 --> 00:42:38.076
Let's see that.

969
00:42:38.703 --> 00:42:39.703
Feel better?

970
00:42:39.787 --> 00:42:41.830
That ice does make me feel better.

971
00:42:43.958 --> 00:42:45.458
Butterflies.

972
00:42:45.543 --> 00:42:48.378
Hey, you know what?
I just remembered I gotta meet a guy.


973
00:42:48.462 --> 00:42:49.629
No, no. Wait.

974
00:42:50.923 --> 00:42:52.883
No, you can't go.

975
00:42:53.050 --> 00:42:54.718
'Cause guess what?

976
00:42:54.802 --> 00:42:55.844
What?

977
00:42:55.928 --> 00:42:57.888
I only do two at a time.

978
00:42:58.681 --> 00:42:59.681
What do you mean?

979
00:42:59.765 --> 00:43:01.182
What do I mean?

980
00:43:04.729 --> 00:43:06.521
There those are.

981
00:43:06.814 --> 00:43:08.481
Yeah, let's do this.

982
00:43:08.566 --> 00:43:10.150
Him first? Okay.

983
00:43:10.234 --> 00:43:11.693
It's your thing.
I don't wanna tell you what to do.


984
00:43:12.904 --> 00:43:14.779
Hold on,
I gotta get the phone.


985
00:43:15.990 --> 00:43:18.909
Hello? Mom?

986
00:43:19.243 --> 00:43:20.243
What?

987
00:43:20.328 --> 00:43:21.453
I wanna know what
the doctor said.


988
00:43:21.537 --> 00:43:23.914
Lou? Lou,
we can't do this.


989
00:43:23.998 --> 00:43:25.165
Yes, we can.

990
00:43:25.249 --> 00:43:26.541
No, this didn't happen.

991
00:43:26.626 --> 00:43:27.626
- We can't do this.
- Yes, we can.


992
00:43:27.752 --> 00:43:29.336
- This didn't happen in the past.
- Yes, it did. Shut up.


993
00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:31.254
This did not fucking
happen in the past.


994
00:43:31.339 --> 00:43:33.131
You shut the fuck up,
please.


995
00:43:33.215 --> 00:43:34.841
We're gonna make, like,
Hitler president or something.


996
00:43:34.926 --> 00:43:36.509
We can't do this.

997
00:43:36.594 --> 00:43:40.263
Look, can you be
fucking normal? Please?


998
00:43:40.348 --> 00:43:42.349
Every young man's fantasy
is to have a three-way.


999
00:43:42.475 --> 00:43:44.517
- Not with another fucking guy.
- It's still a three-way.


1000
00:43:44.602 --> 00:43:46.269
What about the policy
of the butterfly effect?


1001
00:43:46.354 --> 00:43:48.980
The butterfly effect
can suck my nuts!


1002
00:43:49.941 --> 00:43:52.859
Look, we're gonna have sex
with this girl, okay?


1003
00:43:53.027 --> 00:43:55.028
You, me, together.

1004
00:43:55.780 --> 00:43:57.989
Enough of this queer shit.
Let's get the mood right.


1005
00:43:59.283 --> 00:44:00.367
All right.
Look, right there.


1006
00:44:00.451 --> 00:44:01.451
What?

1007
00:44:01.535 --> 00:44:04.162
You don't wanna seem overzealous
with a full-on rager.


1008
00:44:04.246 --> 00:44:06.206
You don't want
to insult the woman, either.


1009
00:44:06.290 --> 00:44:09.167
You're gonna wanna get at least
a half-a-chub going, right?


1010
00:44:09.251 --> 00:44:10.627
- Look at me.
- No.


1011
00:44:10.711 --> 00:44:11.962
- Look at that.
- No.


1012
00:44:12.046 --> 00:44:14.047
Look at how, like,
perfect that is.


1013
00:44:14.131 --> 00:44:16.132
I'm not gonna
fucking look.


1014
00:44:17.051 --> 00:44:18.093
Look, look. Here.

1015
00:44:18.177 --> 00:44:19.219
What the fuck, man?

1016
00:44:20.471 --> 00:44:22.138
- I'm out of here.
- Come on, Jake,


1017
00:44:22.264 --> 00:44:23.932
- I was just getting you started.
- Don't care!


1018
00:44:24.016 --> 00:44:25.016
Guys do that.

1019
00:44:25.101 --> 00:44:26.810
No one does that!

1020
00:44:27.061 --> 00:44:28.645
Hey. Onesies?

1021
00:44:31.482 --> 00:44:32.732
Sorry.

1022
00:44:33.234 --> 00:44:34.484
Okay, cool.
I'm out of here.


1023
00:44:41.993 --> 00:44:43.118
Hey.

1024
00:44:43.202 --> 00:44:45.203
How did it go
with Jenny?


1025
00:44:46.539 --> 00:44:47.706
Oh, my God.

1026
00:44:49.333 --> 00:44:53.128
Oh, my God. Whoo!
Why aren't you dancing?


1027
00:44:53.796 --> 00:44:55.130
Whoa! What's your name?

1028
00:44:55.214 --> 00:44:57.173
That's Jacob.
That's Jenny.


1029
00:44:58.801 --> 00:45:00.343
What the fuck are you doing?

1030
00:45:00.386 --> 00:45:01.845
- You're supposed to break up with her!
- I know.


1031
00:45:01.929 --> 00:45:03.430
No, no, no.
Just check it out, okay?


1032
00:45:03.514 --> 00:45:05.390
Maybe she's
the key to something.


1033
00:45:05.474 --> 00:45:07.976
And I messed it up
when I broke up with her before,


1034
00:45:08.060 --> 00:45:10.353
and now the universe
is giving me another crack at it.


1035
00:45:10.438 --> 00:45:13.231
And if you thought
you could really start over


1036
00:45:13.315 --> 00:45:14.816
and do something
totally different,


1037
00:45:14.900 --> 00:45:16.484
you wouldn't
even consider it?


1038
00:45:16.569 --> 00:45:17.902
You're absolutely right.

1039
00:45:17.987 --> 00:45:18.945
You think so? Really?

1040
00:45:19.030 --> 00:45:20.196
No. Fuck, no!

1041
00:45:20.281 --> 00:45:21.531
Come on!

1042
00:45:24.076 --> 00:45:25.326
What do you mean,
you didn't do it?


1043
00:45:25.411 --> 00:45:26.870
I'm getting to it.

1044
00:45:26.954 --> 00:45:29.038
No, we were supposed to do
everything that we did.


1045
00:45:29.123 --> 00:45:30.123
That's what I remember.

1046
00:45:30.207 --> 00:45:31.624
Yeah, Adam,
what the fuck, man?


1047
00:45:31.709 --> 00:45:32.834
You were supposed
to fucking dump her.


1048
00:45:32.918 --> 00:45:35.378
You think I liked getting my ass fucked
up and down the entire street?


1049
00:45:35.504 --> 00:45:36.880
- Because I didn't.
- It's not that I'm not gonna do it,


1050
00:45:36.964 --> 00:45:38.715
I just haven't done it yet.
There's a big difference.


1051
00:45:38.799 --> 00:45:39.966
Look at my face, dude.

1052
00:45:40.050 --> 00:45:41.718
Look at my fucking face!
Drink me in.


1053
00:45:41.802 --> 00:45:43.219
You think I wouldn't have liked
to have changed this?


1054
00:45:43.304 --> 00:45:46.639
Shut the fuck up, Lou.
You tried to rope me into a three-way.


1055
00:45:46.724 --> 00:45:47.766
- What?
- Did you?


1056
00:45:47.850 --> 00:45:48.975
- No.
- Yes.


1057
00:45:49.059 --> 00:45:50.393
Lou! Did you?

1058
00:45:50.478 --> 00:45:53.646
I didn't fuck that girl.
Okay?


1059
00:45:53.814 --> 00:45:56.858
Because I'm committed
to not changing the past.


1060
00:45:57.067 --> 00:45:58.276
Right. It had nothing to do with her

1061
00:45:58.360 --> 00:45:59.903
wanting to be a Chinese finger trap.

1062
00:45:59.987 --> 00:46:01.946
And I'm not saying that
because she was Asian.


1063
00:46:02.031 --> 00:46:04.407
So you're telling me
I cheated on my wife for no reason.


1064
00:46:05.576 --> 00:46:06.618
Just relax, okay?

1065
00:46:06.702 --> 00:46:08.244
I'm gonna do it.
I just haven't done it yet!


1066
00:46:08.329 --> 00:46:09.329
You're unbelievable.

1067
00:46:09.413 --> 00:46:11.164
- Hey, Nick, can I ask you a question?
- Yes.


1068
00:46:11.248 --> 00:46:13.041
Does this seem like
it's all about Adam again?


1069
00:46:13.125 --> 00:46:15.418
Yeah, just like
Cincinnati.


1070
00:46:16.086 --> 00:46:17.754
- What?
- You gonna bring that up?


1071
00:46:17.838 --> 00:46:20.131
We said we weren't gonna talk
about Cincinnati ever, okay?


1072
00:46:20.216 --> 00:46:23.009
Is this why you have that shoebox
in your closet that says "Cincinnati"?


1073
00:46:23.093 --> 00:46:24.093
Yeah.

1074
00:46:24.178 --> 00:46:25.261
What?
That's fucking admissible!


1075
00:46:25.346 --> 00:46:26.930
You keep it
in the closet?


1076
00:46:27.014 --> 00:46:29.390
What was I supposed to do with it?
You can't bury those things.


1077
00:46:29.475 --> 00:46:31.100
And you wrote
"Cincinnati" on it?


1078
00:46:31.185 --> 00:46:34.103
How do I know which one
it's supposed to be?


1079
00:46:34.438 --> 00:46:35.480
Is it a fetus?

1080
00:46:35.564 --> 00:46:36.940
My friends
are ridiculous.


1081
00:46:37.024 --> 00:46:38.358
Why are we still
talking about this?


1082
00:46:38.442 --> 00:46:40.318
Okay, we said
we would never talk about that.


1083
00:46:40.402 --> 00:46:43.696
By the way, where does it say
in the fucking friendship handbook


1084
00:46:43.781 --> 00:46:47.325
that you are the only one
who is allowed any fucking problems?


1085
00:46:47.409 --> 00:46:49.494
I forgot that it says
in the asshole handbook


1086
00:46:49.578 --> 00:46:52.330
that you can just
fuck over your friends
whenever you want!


1087
00:46:52.414 --> 00:46:54.040
Actually, it would say that
in the asshole handbook


1088
00:46:54.124 --> 00:46:55.542
if it was, like,
guidelines for being an asshole,


1089
00:46:55.626 --> 00:46:57.085
- that's what it would say.
- Why wouldn't it say that


1090
00:46:57.169 --> 00:46:58.294
- in the asshole handbook?
- Yeah, it would say


1091
00:46:58.379 --> 00:46:59.546
- to fuck your friends.
- "Fuck over your friends."


1092
00:46:59.630 --> 00:47:00.922
- No, no, no.
- Have you ever read a book?


1093
00:47:01.006 --> 00:47:04.259
You're right. I'm sorry, my bad.
You guys are right.


1094
00:47:04.426 --> 00:47:06.719
But if you're changing
the fucking past, okay,


1095
00:47:06.804 --> 00:47:09.138
then I'm changing
the fucking past, all right?


1096
00:47:09.223 --> 00:47:10.682
No! Lou!

1097
00:47:10.766 --> 00:47:13.268
Okay! We're in the game!
I like this.


1098
00:47:13.352 --> 00:47:15.103
I didn't change anything yet,
I just didn't do it.


1099
00:47:15.187 --> 00:47:16.354
And if we're
changing shit,


1100
00:47:16.438 --> 00:47:18.356
you better be there at midnight
to get my fucking back.


1101
00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:19.816
- Done.
- I'll be there.


1102
00:47:19.900 --> 00:47:22.318
Guys! Guys! Come on, man.
Talk to me about this!


1103
00:47:22.403 --> 00:47:23.903
- Fuck off.
- Fuck!


1104
00:47:23.988 --> 00:47:25.280
- I'll be back in a minute.
- Where are you going?


1105
00:47:25.364 --> 00:47:26.447
I gotta go.
I'm getting out of here.


1106
00:47:26.532 --> 00:47:28.241
No, no, Adam,
listen to me, please.


1107
00:47:28.325 --> 00:47:30.743
Jenny Stedmeyer is not
your fucking destiny, okay?


1108
00:47:30.828 --> 00:47:31.953
She's just some girl.

1109
00:47:32.037 --> 00:47:34.080
Some girl you dated
in high school, okay?


1110
00:47:34.164 --> 00:47:35.748
I know! I just
got some emotions coming up.

1111
00:47:35.833 --> 00:47:37.166
I got some feelings
that I got to deal with.


1112
00:47:37.251 --> 00:47:39.252
I'm gonna do it.
I believe in you.
You're awesome.


1113
00:47:39.336 --> 00:47:40.920
You know what? That's fine.
Everybody just take off!


1114
00:47:41.005 --> 00:47:42.213
I don't need to be born.

1115
00:47:42.298 --> 00:47:45.508
I'll just go find the repairman myself
and fix the time machine.


1116
00:47:46.510 --> 00:47:48.887
That's the dumbest thing
I've said in a while.


1117
00:47:51.223 --> 00:47:52.765
You made the best
decision of your life,


1118
00:47:52.850 --> 00:47:54.267
choosing me as
your friend over Adam.


1119
00:47:54.351 --> 00:47:55.810
I'm pretty sure
that's not
what's going on here.


1120
00:47:55.895 --> 00:47:57.854
Don't be afraid.
I'm gonna treat you right.


1121
00:47:58.188 --> 00:47:59.731
- Daddy's gonna take care of you.
- Whoa!


1122
00:47:59.857 --> 00:48:00.899
Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa! Whoa!


1123
00:48:00.983 --> 00:48:03.568
Here we go. It's like
a slow-motion guillotine.


1124
00:48:05.362 --> 00:48:07.530
What the F-ing fuck?

1125
00:48:15.873 --> 00:48:18.374
Here we go.
Here we go. Round two.


1126
00:48:20.127 --> 00:48:21.127
Should we help him?

1127
00:48:21.211 --> 00:48:22.503
No. No.
This is his destiny.


1128
00:48:29.929 --> 00:48:30.970
Fuck you!

1129
00:48:31.055 --> 00:48:32.847
- Did it happen?
- No.


1130
00:48:36.226 --> 00:48:37.560
If that guy doesn't
lose his arm soon,


1131
00:48:37.645 --> 00:48:39.812
I'm gonna fucking
take it from him myself.


1132
00:48:39.980 --> 00:48:40.980
Man!

1133
00:48:45.611 --> 00:48:47.070
Blaine!

1134
00:48:47.237 --> 00:48:49.322
Come on down, man.
Have a brewski with us.


1135
00:48:49.406 --> 00:48:50.448
There's a party.

1136
00:48:50.532 --> 00:48:53.534
"No foreign army has ever
occupied American soil.


1137
00:48:53.619 --> 00:48:55.078
"Until now."

1138
00:48:55.454 --> 00:48:56.913
Watching Red Dawn again, or...

1139
00:48:57.081 --> 00:48:58.873
<i>Wolverines!</i>

1140
00:48:59.750 --> 00:49:01.167
They're Ruskies.

1141
00:49:01.251 --> 00:49:03.169
<i>And these are their secret
Commie weapons.</i>


1142
00:49:03.253 --> 00:49:04.671
What are you
talking about?


1143
00:49:04.755 --> 00:49:06.464
Look at this stuff, man.

1144
00:49:06.548 --> 00:49:09.467
They could be
spies or something.


1145
00:49:09.635 --> 00:49:11.344
I don't know, Blaine.
I mean, they seem a little young


1146
00:49:11.428 --> 00:49:12.845
to be spies, you know.

1147
00:49:12.930 --> 00:49:14.097
Come on, Chaz.

1148
00:49:14.932 --> 00:49:17.725
They could be
some kind of 21 Jump Street


1149
00:49:17.893 --> 00:49:20.228
spy battalion-type dudes.

1150
00:49:22.147 --> 00:49:25.441
Yeah. Yeah. Or not at all, you know?
There's also that.


1151
00:49:25.901 --> 00:49:27.318
What the fuck is this?

1152
00:49:28.487 --> 00:49:29.529
There's something
I wanna talk to you about.


1153
00:49:29.613 --> 00:49:31.948
It's something I'm supposed to do
but I don't wanna do.


1154
00:49:32.032 --> 00:49:33.199
- You know why?
- Okay, Adam. But...


1155
00:49:33.283 --> 00:49:36.703
Because I was thinking
about how good we are together, right?


1156
00:49:36.829 --> 00:49:39.038
- Don't you think? I really think so.
- Okay.


1157
00:49:39.123 --> 00:49:41.165
And I was talking about the future
and I was thinking about,


1158
00:49:41.250 --> 00:49:43.376
well, my future is this way
and maybe it could be this way.


1159
00:49:43.460 --> 00:49:45.545
I know I'm rambling now.
God, you're so beautiful.


1160
00:49:45.629 --> 00:49:47.046
But we got along
so great and...


1161
00:49:47.131 --> 00:49:48.756
What is that?

1162
00:49:49.258 --> 00:49:51.801
It's a note I wrote to you.
You should read it.


1163
00:49:52.094 --> 00:49:54.137
- Right now? Okay.
- Yeah.


1164
00:49:54.221 --> 00:49:57.724
"Dear Adam, you're a super-terrific guy
and I love you.


1165
00:49:57.850 --> 00:49:58.975
Aw!

1166
00:49:59.393 --> 00:50:00.685
"And that's why
this is so hard for me.


1167
00:50:00.769 --> 00:50:04.188
"You're one of the most
amazing people that I've ever met. I can't..."


1168
00:50:04.356 --> 00:50:07.775
Are you breaking up with me?
That's what this... This is a break-up note?


1169
00:50:08.152 --> 00:50:09.402
I'm sorry, Adam.

1170
00:50:09.486 --> 00:50:11.904
All these years!
You stabbed me in the eye with a fucking fork


1171
00:50:11.989 --> 00:50:13.740
and you were gonna
break up with me anyway?


1172
00:50:13.824 --> 00:50:14.907
Is that what
you're saying to me?


1173
00:50:14.992 --> 00:50:16.034
I did what?

1174
00:50:16.118 --> 00:50:18.953
Why are you breaking up with me?
That's not how this works.


1175
00:50:19.621 --> 00:50:22.081
You're such a great guy
and you're gonna find the right girl,


1176
00:50:22.166 --> 00:50:23.374
but it's not me.

1177
00:50:23.459 --> 00:50:27.128
And everybody knows what a big deal
you're gonna be some day.


1178
00:50:28.172 --> 00:50:31.507
No, I'm not.
I'm not. I'm not anybody.


1179
00:50:31.675 --> 00:50:35.344
Adam, okay.
It's not you, it's me.


1180
00:50:37.181 --> 00:50:39.807
I say that to you.
You don't say that to me.


1181
00:50:39.892 --> 00:50:41.768
That's not how this works.

1182
00:50:41.852 --> 00:50:44.854
Do you know what happens to you
if we don't go back?


1183
00:50:45.481 --> 00:50:46.522
You end up with
Billy Lavatino.


1184
00:50:46.607 --> 00:50:47.607
I like him.

1185
00:50:47.691 --> 00:50:50.610
You may like him, but then you
end up pregnant with, like, trucker hips,


1186
00:50:50.694 --> 00:50:52.403
and you have a baby
with Billy Lavatino,


1187
00:50:52.488 --> 00:50:54.363
and you're addicted
to Weight Watchers, you little bitch.


1188
00:50:54.490 --> 00:50:56.240
- What did you just call me?
- Take this fucking back!


1189
00:50:56.325 --> 00:50:58.659
Don't you... Jesus!

1190
00:51:01.830 --> 00:51:03.247
I don't get fat!

1191
00:51:04.208 --> 00:51:05.208
Gross!

1192
00:51:09.463 --> 00:51:12.381
If we're changing shit,
we gotta be taking advantage of shit.


1193
00:51:12.549 --> 00:51:14.550
- No.
- Mulligan.


1194
00:51:15.052 --> 00:51:16.385
- No mulligan.
- Come on!


1195
00:51:16.470 --> 00:51:18.012
- You had, like, five mulligans.
- Dude.


1196
00:51:18.180 --> 00:51:20.306
I'm not talking
about bad stuff,
either, okay?


1197
00:51:20.390 --> 00:51:21.432
I'm just talking
about good stuff.


1198
00:51:21.517 --> 00:51:25.144
Like keeping Manimal on the air,
you know?


1199
00:51:25.229 --> 00:51:26.437
Or preventing
Miley Cyrus.


1200
00:51:26.522 --> 00:51:28.147
Preventing her
from what?


1201
00:51:28.232 --> 00:51:29.440
Just preventing her.

1202
00:51:29.525 --> 00:51:32.318
<i>And there's the catch!
First down!</i>


1203
00:51:37.574 --> 00:51:38.991
Oh, shit!

1204
00:51:39.660 --> 00:51:40.868
I know this game.

1205
00:51:40.953 --> 00:51:42.078
Yeah?

1206
00:51:42.162 --> 00:51:43.996
Yeah. This is the Denver-Cleveland
playoff game.


1207
00:51:44.164 --> 00:51:45.748
This is the fucking Drive, man.

1208
00:51:45.833 --> 00:51:46.916
Yeah?

1209
00:51:48.919 --> 00:51:50.419
I know what
we're gonna do.


1210
00:51:57.094 --> 00:51:59.762
Adam, hey. You're back. Awesome.

1211
00:52:00.222 --> 00:52:02.473
What's going on here?
Where are the guys?


1212
00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:05.101
- What's this?
- Read it.


1213
00:52:05.269 --> 00:52:07.895
"Dear Adam, you are
a super-terrific guy and I love you,


1214
00:52:07.980 --> 00:52:11.691
"which is why this is so hard for me.
I cherish our friendship."


1215
00:52:13.610 --> 00:52:15.194
She broke up with you?

1216
00:52:15.362 --> 00:52:17.738
And you still fucking got stabbed
in the eye?


1217
00:52:18.115 --> 00:52:19.782
Leave me alone.
Get out of here.


1218
00:52:19.992 --> 00:52:21.826
What are you doing here?
You writing poetry?


1219
00:52:21.910 --> 00:52:23.786
Just leave me alone
and get out of here. No.


1220
00:52:23.871 --> 00:52:25.538
You're writing
fucking break-up poetry.


1221
00:52:25.622 --> 00:52:27.957
All right, I'm writing
break-up poetry, okay?


1222
00:52:28.959 --> 00:52:30.418
Because my heart hurts.

1223
00:52:30.627 --> 00:52:31.669
She stabbed me in
my heart and my eye.


1224
00:52:31.753 --> 00:52:32.753
Holy shit, you're wasted.

1225
00:52:32.838 --> 00:52:36.174
Look, I've had
like two wine kills,
Captain Buzzcooler.


1226
00:52:36.258 --> 00:52:37.925
- God.
- You're fucked up.


1227
00:52:39.261 --> 00:52:42.054
"Jenny's eyes, like a gypsy's lies
Cut right through the night


1228
00:52:42.139 --> 00:52:44.348
"Now those eyes are another guy's
And I'm alone with my pain"


1229
00:52:44.433 --> 00:52:45.558
That was clean.

1230
00:52:45.642 --> 00:52:47.643
Are you shitting
me with this, Adam?


1231
00:52:48.979 --> 00:52:50.188
Look, you can
recite it straight


1232
00:52:50.272 --> 00:52:51.647
or to the tune of
Sweet Child O' Mine.


1233
00:52:51.732 --> 00:52:52.815
It doesn't matter.

1234
00:52:52.900 --> 00:52:56.235
Are these mushrooms?
Did you eat these mushrooms, Adam?


1235
00:52:56.320 --> 00:52:58.863
I like to eat them, you know?
A couple of them.


1236
00:52:58.947 --> 00:53:00.656
Holy fuck, man,
you gotta stay straight!


1237
00:53:00.782 --> 00:53:02.658
- You gotta help me get the guys back!
- Just relax.


1238
00:53:02.743 --> 00:53:04.493
You know, it's not always about
my emotional journey.


1239
00:53:04.578 --> 00:53:06.078
- It could be about yours.
- Put the coke down!


1240
00:53:06.163 --> 00:53:07.663
- God damn it, you little fucker!
- Give it to me!


1241
00:53:07.748 --> 00:53:10.416
Don't you fucking get it?
I'm not gonna be fucking born!


1242
00:53:14.046 --> 00:53:16.672
How much worse
can it get?


1243
00:53:16.840 --> 00:53:18.466
What? The '80s?

1244
00:53:19.051 --> 00:53:20.927
New part shorted
out another part.


1245
00:53:21.011 --> 00:53:22.929
I hope we can get
that thing working before dawn.


1246
00:53:23.013 --> 00:53:24.096
Wait, wait, hold on,

1247
00:53:24.181 --> 00:53:25.973
is that when
the time portal closes,
at dawn?


1248
00:53:26.058 --> 00:53:27.433
That's when
the party's over.


1249
00:53:27.517 --> 00:53:28.935
Fuck you, man. Listen.

1250
00:53:29.019 --> 00:53:31.437
I am at
my wit's end with him,
so you gotta level with me.


1251
00:53:31.521 --> 00:53:33.814
Are you the mystical
time-travel guide-guy or not?


1252
00:53:33.899 --> 00:53:36.150
Don't you put
your hands on me, young lady!


1253
00:53:37.319 --> 00:53:39.195
I'm just trying
to do my job, here.


1254
00:53:39.279 --> 00:53:41.364
Fuck, hold on.
Quit eating mushrooms, man!


1255
00:53:41.490 --> 00:53:43.199
I wanna have a few more.

1256
00:53:45.535 --> 00:53:48.537
What the fuck
is happening to me?
I can't...


1257
00:53:49.373 --> 00:53:50.373
Dawn.

1258
00:53:54.211 --> 00:53:55.294
Hey, Adam.

1259
00:53:55.379 --> 00:53:58.297
All right, so anyway,
the repairman's doing his thing.


1260
00:53:58.382 --> 00:53:59.590
I'm gonna go
find Nick and Lou,


1261
00:53:59.675 --> 00:54:01.092
and you stay right here.
Okay?


1262
00:54:01.176 --> 00:54:02.134
I'm gonna stay.

1263
00:54:02.219 --> 00:54:03.803
You got it,
but you can't leave.


1264
00:54:03.887 --> 00:54:06.389
I can't move,
because I'm broken.


1265
00:54:07.182 --> 00:54:09.016
Man, you and my mom
are so fucked.


1266
00:54:11.270 --> 00:54:12.728
Hungry.

1267
00:54:14.398 --> 00:54:15.398
Evening.

1268
00:54:15.482 --> 00:54:16.649
You've got two arms.

1269
00:54:17.401 --> 00:54:19.318
But you're not going to.
You're gonna lose one.


1270
00:54:19.903 --> 00:54:20.945
What?

1271
00:54:21.029 --> 00:54:22.405
You're gonna lose that arm.

1272
00:54:24.408 --> 00:54:25.783
You're one of those joker guys.

1273
00:54:25.867 --> 00:54:26.909
Right. Right.

1274
00:54:26.994 --> 00:54:29.662
I don't care if you put that arm
in a steel fucking vault,


1275
00:54:29.746 --> 00:54:31.414
that arm's coming off!

1276
00:54:31.748 --> 00:54:33.040
You're gonna lose your arm.

1277
00:54:33.125 --> 00:54:34.500
You're gonna lose your arm!

1278
00:54:34.584 --> 00:54:35.876
I'm gonna rape you.
I'm gonna rape you!


1279
00:54:35.961 --> 00:54:38.129
I'm gonna rape you.
I'm gonna rape you.


1280
00:54:38.213 --> 00:54:39.880
- Have a great night.
- Okay.


1281
00:54:40.215 --> 00:54:41.924
<i>...to the end zone.
Touchdown Cleveland!</i>


1282
00:54:44.553 --> 00:54:46.387
Pay up, suckers!
Pay up!


1283
00:54:46.471 --> 00:54:49.890
How does he do it?
How is he right
all the time?


1284
00:54:49.975 --> 00:54:51.642
Let me ask you
something, McFly.


1285
00:54:52.436 --> 00:54:53.686
How you getting so lucky?

1286
00:54:53.770 --> 00:54:55.771
I know the fucking future,
douche bag.


1287
00:54:55.939 --> 00:54:57.565
Really? One more bet.

1288
00:54:57.649 --> 00:55:00.318
Ricky, come on.
You said one more
and then you'd be done.


1289
00:55:00.610 --> 00:55:02.862
I also said to shut the fuck up.
Remember that?


1290
00:55:02.946 --> 00:55:04.822
Okay, I love you.
Shut the fuck up.


1291
00:55:05.032 --> 00:55:06.198
By the way,
I love your coat.


1292
00:55:06.283 --> 00:55:08.117
I don't give a shit
about animals, either, so...


1293
00:55:08.618 --> 00:55:10.077
One more bet.
High stakes.


1294
00:55:10.162 --> 00:55:12.663
All right. All right.
Bring it on, Spader.


1295
00:55:12.748 --> 00:55:14.290
Bring it on, Jo
-Jo.

1296
00:55:14.416 --> 00:55:16.208
I bet Elway throws
a touchdown pass


1297
00:55:16.293 --> 00:55:18.127
with 37 seconds
left on the clock.


1298
00:55:18.295 --> 00:55:20.546
Fat chance, asshole.
Elway's done nothing
all day.


1299
00:55:20.630 --> 00:55:23.924
Well then, in the spirit of high stakes,
let's make it interesting.


1300
00:55:24.009 --> 00:55:25.051
Let's make it
interesting.


1301
00:55:25.135 --> 00:55:28.721
If I win, your
wife gives me a blowjob.

1302
00:55:29.139 --> 00:55:30.348
Really?

1303
00:55:30.432 --> 00:55:31.599
A classy one.

1304
00:55:34.394 --> 00:55:36.020
- Hey, screw you, kid.
- Hey, okay,


1305
00:55:36.104 --> 00:55:38.439
and if you win,
name your price.


1306
00:55:39.983 --> 00:55:41.984
Touchdown pass at

1307
00:55:42.069 --> 00:55:43.486
Exactly.

1308
00:55:44.279 --> 00:55:45.488
Fine.

1309
00:55:45.739 --> 00:55:47.156
You lose,
I take all your winnings.


1310
00:55:47.240 --> 00:55:48.282
Done.

1311
00:55:48.367 --> 00:55:49.742
And you give your
buddy a blowjob.


1312
00:55:49.826 --> 00:55:51.744
What? Hell, no.

1313
00:55:51.828 --> 00:55:52.995
Wow!

1314
00:55:53.080 --> 00:55:54.163
- Deal.
- Deal?


1315
00:55:54.206 --> 00:55:55.956
- Well done. I like your style.
- I like your style.


1316
00:55:56.041 --> 00:55:57.124
He's very creative.

1317
00:55:57.209 --> 00:55:59.627
I don't like you
taking liberties with my dick.


1318
00:55:59.795 --> 00:56:01.253
Relax, okay?

1319
00:56:01.338 --> 00:56:03.839
We know the fucking future.
We can't lose.


1320
00:56:06.802 --> 00:56:10.846
Hey. Hey, there.
What are you doing?


1321
00:56:11.598 --> 00:56:13.057
- Hi.
- Hey.


1322
00:56:13.892 --> 00:56:15.476
Okay, how's the view
from down there?


1323
00:56:19.439 --> 00:56:20.856
It's nice.

1324
00:56:22.526 --> 00:56:23.734
Adam, right?

1325
00:56:24.945 --> 00:56:26.070
Yeah.

1326
00:56:26.154 --> 00:56:27.613
Why are you
bleeding in the snow?


1327
00:56:27.697 --> 00:56:28.823
That? No, I...

1328
00:56:28.907 --> 00:56:31.534
I got stabbed in
the face with a fork.

1329
00:56:32.077 --> 00:56:35.037
I saw it coming and I avoided it.
I mean, I didn't avoid it.


1330
00:56:35.247 --> 00:56:38.165
It just happened again to me
in a slightly different way.


1331
00:56:38.625 --> 00:56:41.752
Boy, I really wish
I knew what the fuck you were talking about.


1332
00:56:43.422 --> 00:56:45.965
All the choices we make in our life,
they're pointless.


1333
00:56:46.049 --> 00:56:47.925
There's no escaping
the inevitable.


1334
00:56:48.427 --> 00:56:49.885
I don't know, man.

1335
00:56:52.556 --> 00:56:56.142
So, you're saying that your whole
entire life is predetermined to suck,


1336
00:56:56.226 --> 00:56:57.435
no matter what you do?

1337
00:56:57.519 --> 00:56:58.936
It's not the way
I want it, but...


1338
00:56:59.104 --> 00:57:01.689
Kind of seems like
a really, really good excuse


1339
00:57:01.773 --> 00:57:04.859
to do something totally amazing
right now, tonight.


1340
00:57:06.319 --> 00:57:07.528
Like what?

1341
00:57:08.196 --> 00:57:12.366
Like perhaps
hang out with a girl that you just met


1342
00:57:12.451 --> 00:57:14.827
before her bus
has to leave in two hours?


1343
00:57:15.412 --> 00:57:16.495
Right-o.

1344
00:57:17.497 --> 00:57:19.206
I thought you said
we were going to get some food.


1345
00:57:19.291 --> 00:57:22.251
We are.
We're about to get some food.


1346
00:57:22.335 --> 00:57:24.920
I'm pretty hungry,
actually.


1347
00:57:25.088 --> 00:57:27.339
Damn it.
They forgot to leave the key.


1348
00:57:27.507 --> 00:57:28.591
Who did?

1349
00:57:28.675 --> 00:57:32.136
Carol and Stan Stapleton.
They're my friends. They live here,


1350
00:57:32.220 --> 00:57:35.014
and I housesit for them
when they go to Nepal, sometimes.


1351
00:57:35.182 --> 00:57:37.057
I thought you said
you came in here on a bus.


1352
00:57:37.142 --> 00:57:40.227
They usually do leave,
like, a side door open.


1353
00:57:40.437 --> 00:57:42.271
- They do?
- So let me... I'll be right back.


1354
00:57:42.606 --> 00:57:43.606
Okay.

1355
00:57:45.066 --> 00:57:46.942
Yep, it's unlocked.

1356
00:57:51.698 --> 00:57:52.907
Cheers.

1357
00:57:53.450 --> 00:57:55.618
So which one's Carol?

1358
00:57:58.580 --> 00:57:59.872
Carol's on the left.

1359
00:58:01.041 --> 00:58:03.292
<i>Elway's last stand.

1360
00:58:03.627 --> 00:58:06.045
I'm really good at getting head.
You'll see.


1361
00:58:07.297 --> 00:58:08.714
<i>- Elway takes the snap.</i>
- Go, baby.


1362
00:58:08.798 --> 00:58:12.051
<i>He fades back. Elway fires.
He's got Jackson open.</i>


1363
00:58:12.135 --> 00:58:13.886
<i>He's impossibly open!</i>

1364
00:58:13.970 --> 00:58:15.554
<i>Wait, what's this? Vermin?</i>

1365
00:58:15.639 --> 00:58:17.139
No, no, no!
I know this squirrel.


1366
00:58:17.224 --> 00:58:19.225
<i>That's a magic fucking squirrel.
This doesn't count.</i>


1367
00:58:19.309 --> 00:58:20.601
<i>He's distracted by a wild squirrel!</i>

1368
00:58:20.685 --> 00:58:21.727
<i>What the fuck?</i>

1369
00:58:21.811 --> 00:58:24.688
<i>Incomplete! Game's over!
Cleveland wins!</i>


1370
00:58:24.773 --> 00:58:27.024
The Dawg Pound is going
to the Super Bowl.


1371
00:58:27.108 --> 00:58:28.234
Oh, yeah!

1372
00:58:28.318 --> 00:58:29.777
<i>I've never seen anything like it!</i>

1373
00:58:31.112 --> 00:58:32.238
He did it. Got to go!

1374
00:58:32.322 --> 00:58:33.739
Congratulations.
Look at all that money.


1375
00:58:33.823 --> 00:58:37.034
I was kidding about the blowjob thing.
Obviously, we're comedians.


1376
00:58:37.118 --> 00:58:38.619
Hey, guys. Guys.

1377
00:58:39.329 --> 00:58:40.704
A bet's a bet.

1378
00:58:42.999 --> 00:58:44.833
Motherfucker!

1379
00:58:46.169 --> 00:58:47.419
So you're a Time Lord?

1380
00:58:47.504 --> 00:58:48.629
Mmm-hmm.

1381
00:58:48.713 --> 00:58:51.715
And a Jacuzzi is your spaceship?

1382
00:58:52.551 --> 00:58:53.759
That is correct, madam.

1383
00:58:53.927 --> 00:58:55.678
That's the only part
of this whole thing


1384
00:58:55.762 --> 00:58:57.429
that doesn't make sense to me.

1385
00:58:57.514 --> 00:58:59.974
You're not the only one.
Believe me.


1386
00:59:00.058 --> 00:59:02.893
I mean, the whole thing
is just totally insane.


1387
00:59:03.019 --> 00:59:04.061
Ew!

1388
00:59:05.397 --> 00:59:07.314
So, how's the future
working out for you?


1389
00:59:07.399 --> 00:59:09.900
I mean,
are you like a happy grownup?


1390
00:59:10.235 --> 00:59:11.277
Not particularly, no.

1391
00:59:11.361 --> 00:59:12.361
Yeah.

1392
00:59:12.445 --> 00:59:14.863
My friends actually
think I ended up being


1393
00:59:14.948 --> 00:59:17.324
a completely selfish,
fucked-up person.


1394
00:59:18.118 --> 00:59:20.119
And they may have a point,
actually, if I think about it.


1395
00:59:20.203 --> 00:59:21.245
Hmm...

1396
00:59:21.329 --> 00:59:23.664
I'll tell you something I haven't told
somebody for a long time.


1397
00:59:23.957 --> 00:59:25.124
When I was a kid,

1398
00:59:25.208 --> 00:59:28.377
every Friday night,
my father used to take my sister Kelly and me


1399
00:59:28.461 --> 00:59:32.089
to this place called Flatirons
for steak sandwiches.


1400
00:59:32.173 --> 00:59:33.215
It was a family tradition.

1401
00:59:33.300 --> 00:59:35.092
That's sometimes
a good thing.


1402
00:59:35.260 --> 00:59:37.803
But one year,
we saw this commercial


1403
00:59:38.430 --> 00:59:41.056
for this place called
The Enchanted Forest of Pizza.


1404
00:59:41.725 --> 00:59:45.352
So the next Friday,
my dad's loading us up into the car.


1405
00:59:45.520 --> 00:59:48.522
We're like, "Daddy, we want
to go to The Enchanted Forest of Pizza."


1406
00:59:48.607 --> 00:59:50.316
And he's like,
"What are you talking about?


1407
00:59:50.400 --> 00:59:52.401
"We always go for
steak sandwiches."


1408
00:59:52.485 --> 00:59:54.153
But we just stay at him

1409
00:59:54.237 --> 00:59:57.197
and we're whining,
and we're badgering, and finally he relents.


1410
00:59:57.282 --> 00:59:58.741
Nice. So, you win.

1411
00:59:58.825 --> 01:00:01.493
You deviated from the plan
in a really big way. That's good.


1412
01:00:02.454 --> 01:00:04.538
33 people died of E. Coli.

1413
01:00:05.790 --> 01:00:07.207
Including my father.

1414
01:00:07.751 --> 01:00:09.877
<i>Before he died, he looked at me and he
said,</i>


1415
01:00:10.045 --> 01:00:11.545
"Adam, you did this."

1416
01:00:11.713 --> 01:00:13.088
No, he didn't.

1417
01:00:13.256 --> 01:00:14.423
Yes, he did,

1418
01:00:14.799 --> 01:00:15.841
with his eyes.

1419
01:00:15.925 --> 01:00:18.677
I don't think that
that's what he meant with his eyes.


1420
01:00:18.762 --> 01:00:22.681
The point is that Kelly and I dealt with
the guilt of this in very different ways.


1421
01:00:22.849 --> 01:00:24.266
She went wild, right?

1422
01:00:24.434 --> 01:00:26.101
She didn't want to have control over anything.

1423
01:00:26.269 --> 01:00:28.520
But I vowed to master the chaos,

1424
01:00:28.605 --> 01:00:30.356
- to impose order.
- Adam, I really don't think


1425
01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:34.109
that you can let a poison pizza ruin
the rest of your life.


1426
01:00:34.653 --> 01:00:37.488
You got to embrace the chaos.
You have to.


1427
01:00:37.656 --> 01:00:41.200
That way, life might just
astonish you.


1428
01:00:50.669 --> 01:00:52.544
- I had so much fun tonight.
- I know!


1429
01:00:52.629 --> 01:00:53.962
Fuck! Game on.

1430
01:00:56.466 --> 01:00:57.466
- You look so hot, by the way.
- Thanks.


1431
01:00:58.843 --> 01:01:00.803
I said,
start sucking, gaylord.


1432
01:01:01.429 --> 01:01:03.472
Yeah! Suck!

1433
01:01:03.556 --> 01:01:04.682
Suck that shit, man!

1434
01:01:04.766 --> 01:01:08.060
- Suck! Suck! Suck!
- Suck! Suck! Suck!


1435
01:01:08.144 --> 01:01:10.062
Who are you people?

1436
01:01:10.146 --> 01:01:12.439
God, who are you people?

1437
01:01:12.524 --> 01:01:14.525
Let's get on with this.
My fondue's getting cold.


1438
01:01:14.609 --> 01:01:16.110
Choke on that horn, man!

1439
01:01:19.989 --> 01:01:21.031
Oh!

1440
01:01:21.116 --> 01:01:22.950
Wow, good for you.

1441
01:01:23.034 --> 01:01:24.118
I know, right?

1442
01:01:24.202 --> 01:01:26.745
It's like Gary Coleman's
fucking forearm.


1443
01:01:26.830 --> 01:01:28.831
It's so black!

1444
01:01:28.957 --> 01:01:31.417
It's so impossibly black.

1445
01:01:32.502 --> 01:01:34.878
- I love you, buddy.
- Don't say that!


1446
01:01:34.963 --> 01:01:36.296
I'm sorry, I do.

1447
01:01:37.215 --> 01:01:38.424
No, no, no!

1448
01:01:50.854 --> 01:01:52.771
Hey, you.

1449
01:01:53.189 --> 01:01:55.441
Maybe what you need
isn't in here, after all.


1450
01:01:55.608 --> 01:01:59.737
Maybe what you need
has always been in here.


1451
01:02:00.155 --> 01:02:01.572
- Really?
- No.


1452
01:02:04.951 --> 01:02:06.869
The tub?
Is it fixed yet?


1453
01:02:07.036 --> 01:02:09.037
Can be. Ready to go?

1454
01:02:09.122 --> 01:02:10.330
Wait, go where?

1455
01:02:10.415 --> 01:02:12.458
To the room, check it out.
I've got the part right here.


1456
01:02:12.542 --> 01:02:13.709
Yeah. Yeah, let's go.

1457
01:02:13.793 --> 01:02:14.877
- Let's go.
- Right.


1458
01:02:19.299 --> 01:02:21.341
- Where did he go?
- Who?


1459
01:02:21.426 --> 01:02:23.051
This fucking guy.

1460
01:02:24.471 --> 01:02:26.972
Nicholas.

1461
01:02:28.266 --> 01:02:30.642
Nicky. Nicholas.

1462
01:02:31.978 --> 01:02:34.271
Hey! There he is!

1463
01:02:34.814 --> 01:02:36.231
- What?
- What the fuck?


1464
01:02:36.316 --> 01:02:37.441
What? What?

1465
01:02:38.735 --> 01:02:40.736
What, do I still
have some on my face?


1466
01:02:41.780 --> 01:02:43.155
Oh, God!

1467
01:02:43.239 --> 01:02:44.490
Damn!

1468
01:02:45.784 --> 01:02:47.451
Did you have
pineapple today?


1469
01:02:47.535 --> 01:02:49.870
I can't go home.
What the fuck?


1470
01:02:50.288 --> 01:02:52.080
I'm fucking with you, dude.

1471
01:02:52.165 --> 01:02:53.373
It's hand soap.

1472
01:02:54.584 --> 01:02:56.668
Oh, my God. Relax.

1473
01:02:56.753 --> 01:02:58.504
It's like you haven't
seen a little come


1474
01:02:58.588 --> 01:03:00.464
on your friend's face before,
or something.


1475
01:03:00.548 --> 01:03:02.341
What the fuck is
wrong with you, man?


1476
01:03:02.425 --> 01:03:05.093
I'm just kidding.
It's what friends do. God!


1477
01:03:05.178 --> 01:03:06.345
You didn't?

1478
01:03:06.429 --> 01:03:08.806
Gargle your hog?
No, man.


1479
01:03:09.265 --> 01:03:11.391
After they pulled you off of me,
me and Rick talked it out.


1480
01:03:11.476 --> 01:03:12.976
He's actually
a pretty cool guy.


1481
01:03:13.061 --> 01:03:16.605
We have a lot in common.
We both love tits and Motley Crue.


1482
01:03:16.773 --> 01:03:17.981
It's cool?

1483
01:03:18.066 --> 01:03:19.608
Yeah, I just told
him a bunch of shit


1484
01:03:19.692 --> 01:03:21.235
that's gonna make
him rich in the future.


1485
01:03:21.402 --> 01:03:23.445
I saved
the good stuff for us.


1486
01:03:24.197 --> 01:03:26.657
Let's go to the bar,
plan our empire.


1487
01:03:31.621 --> 01:03:34.873
Fucking iPods, you know?
Fucking Prius.


1488
01:03:35.291 --> 01:03:38.919
Match. Com. Anything. Com.
Fucking Internet. Com!


1489
01:03:39.087 --> 01:03:43.340
Fucking Zac Efron.
Nobody invented him yet.


1490
01:03:43.424 --> 01:03:46.218
What about Twitter?
Whatever the fuck that is.


1491
01:03:46.302 --> 01:03:50.848
Hey, we could combine
Twitter with fucking Viagra.


1492
01:03:51.975 --> 01:03:53.433
Twitt-agra.

1493
01:03:54.811 --> 01:03:56.186
What's the matter, dude?
Come on.


1494
01:03:56.271 --> 01:03:59.523
I'm sorry, man.
I'm just preoccupied.


1495
01:03:59.983 --> 01:04:03.068
You just kind of down
about being black and out of shape?


1496
01:04:03.194 --> 01:04:05.237
What the fuck is
wrong with you? No.


1497
01:04:05.321 --> 01:04:06.989
Because you look good,
you know?


1498
01:04:07.073 --> 01:04:08.949
This is a great time
for black people.


1499
01:04:09.325 --> 01:04:10.325
I mean our time,
not this time.


1500
01:04:10.410 --> 01:04:11.785
This is a terrible time
for black people.


1501
01:04:11.870 --> 01:04:14.121
I don't see one other
black person in here.


1502
01:04:15.373 --> 01:04:16.665
Talk to me, man.

1503
01:04:16.916 --> 01:04:18.417
I found out she
fucking cheated.


1504
01:04:18.585 --> 01:04:21.545
What? Courtney's
fucking cheating on you?


1505
01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:24.965
I gave her my life,
I gave up my passion.


1506
01:04:25.174 --> 01:04:26.425
And she's just
out there...


1507
01:04:26.509 --> 01:04:28.385
Why the fuck
didn't you say something, man?


1508
01:04:28.469 --> 01:04:31.680
That's just it!
I never see you guys anymore.


1509
01:04:32.140 --> 01:04:34.725
I don't have my music,
I barely have friends.


1510
01:04:35.226 --> 01:04:36.435
Without Courtney,

1511
01:04:37.103 --> 01:04:38.186
I'm nothing.

1512
01:04:38.271 --> 01:04:40.522
You're just fucking
Courtney's bitch right now.


1513
01:04:40.607 --> 01:04:43.108
You need to be
your own man,
you know?


1514
01:04:43.276 --> 01:04:45.068
"Nick Webber-Agnew"?
What the fuck is that?


1515
01:04:45.153 --> 01:04:46.528
- It's terrible.
- It doesn't work.


1516
01:04:46.613 --> 01:04:49.197
No. Nick Webber,
that's who you are.


1517
01:04:49.991 --> 01:04:51.450
That's who I was.

1518
01:04:51.743 --> 01:04:53.702
Maybe you gotta
find him again.


1519
01:04:53.995 --> 01:04:57.331
You know, she's getting hers,
you go get yours.


1520
01:04:58.166 --> 01:04:59.541
I can't, man.

1521
01:04:59.709 --> 01:05:01.335
It means something
to me to be married.


1522
01:05:01.419 --> 01:05:03.378
You're not fucking married.
It's 1986.


1523
01:05:03.463 --> 01:05:04.504
In my heart I am.

1524
01:05:04.589 --> 01:05:06.048
Your heart's
a fucking liar.


1525
01:05:15.224 --> 01:05:18.060
You know what?
You know what you got to do?


1526
01:05:18.227 --> 01:05:19.269
What?

1527
01:05:19.812 --> 01:05:21.897
You gotta get your
ass up on that stage.


1528
01:05:23.566 --> 01:05:24.733
You're right.

1529
01:05:26.235 --> 01:05:27.235
I'm gonna do it.

1530
01:05:27.320 --> 01:05:28.362
Yeah. Do it.

1531
01:05:28.446 --> 01:05:31.573
Hey, hey, hey.
Do it fucking quickly, okay?


1532
01:05:31.741 --> 01:05:32.950
You better be at
that fight with me.


1533
01:05:33.034 --> 01:05:33.992
Don't leave me
hanging this time.


1534
01:05:34.077 --> 01:05:35.577
- I won't. I promise.
- All right.


1535
01:05:36.079 --> 01:05:38.497
Hey, Adam. Fuck.

1536
01:05:41.918 --> 01:05:43.085
Guys?

1537
01:05:48.925 --> 01:05:50.175
You're good to go.

1538
01:05:50.802 --> 01:05:51.885
Holy shit. Really?

1539
01:05:51.970 --> 01:05:53.762
Some sort of
sticky liquid got into


1540
01:05:53.846 --> 01:05:56.264
the crossover housing,
I don't know.


1541
01:05:56.432 --> 01:05:58.433
Must have had some
nitratriminium in it.


1542
01:05:59.435 --> 01:06:00.769
It's Chernobly.

1543
01:06:00.853 --> 01:06:03.689
Whatever it was, it ravaged
the hell out of the electronics.


1544
01:06:03.773 --> 01:06:05.983
Worked out for you
and the boys, though.


1545
01:06:06.067 --> 01:06:07.192
Wait, hold on,
are you saying that


1546
01:06:07.276 --> 01:06:08.360
that's the key to
the whole thing?


1547
01:06:08.444 --> 01:06:09.695
We need the Chernobly
to get back?


1548
01:06:09.779 --> 01:06:13.740
All I'm saying is, whatever your poison,
I wouldn't tub without it.


1549
01:06:13.825 --> 01:06:15.492
Especially after dawn.

1550
01:06:15.576 --> 01:06:17.953
It'd kill you
to give me a straight answer?


1551
01:06:18.871 --> 01:06:20.706
You know,
you're kind of a dick.


1552
01:06:21.124 --> 01:06:23.834
Hey, everybody,
you ready to jam?


1553
01:06:24.002 --> 01:06:25.252
All right.

1554
01:06:25.336 --> 01:06:28.547
Ladies and gentlemen,
help me welcome to the stage


1555
01:06:28.631 --> 01:06:30.465
Nick Webber!

1556
01:06:31.551 --> 01:06:32.718
Hi.

1557
01:06:33.886 --> 01:06:35.721
It's been a long time.

1558
01:06:41.310 --> 01:06:43.395
¢Ü No, I'm never
gonna dance again ¢Ü


1559
01:06:43.479 --> 01:06:46.857
¢Ü Guilty feet
have got no rhythm ¢Ü


1560
01:06:56.159 --> 01:06:58.326
¢Ü Jessie is a friend ¢Ü

1561
01:06:59.328 --> 01:07:02.831
¢Ü Yeah, I know he's been
a good friend of mine ¢Ü


1562
01:07:03.332 --> 01:07:06.710
¢Ü But lately something's changed
It ain't hard to define ¢Ü


1563
01:07:06.794 --> 01:07:10.172
¢Ü Jessie's got himself a girl
And I want to make her mine ¢Ü


1564
01:07:12.884 --> 01:07:15.093
These guys are dangerous.
Look at this stuff.


1565
01:07:15.178 --> 01:07:17.012
Blaine, it looks
like a skinny soda can.


1566
01:07:17.096 --> 01:07:20.932
No, a soda-can bomb!
This stuff's straight out of Moscow.


1567
01:07:21.017 --> 01:07:22.976
Let's go kick
that Commie's ass!


1568
01:07:23.061 --> 01:07:24.102
Chaz.

1569
01:07:24.187 --> 01:07:26.688
Shouldn't we call the cops
or the FBI or something?


1570
01:07:27.148 --> 01:07:30.150
No, we're gonna
handle this internally.


1571
01:07:39.702 --> 01:07:40.869
¢Ü I wish that I had ¢Ü

1572
01:07:40.953 --> 01:07:42.621
¢Ü Jessie's girl ¢Ü

1573
01:07:42.955 --> 01:07:44.247
¢Ü I wish that I had ¢Ü

1574
01:07:44.332 --> 01:07:46.041
¢Ü Jessie's girl ¢Ü

1575
01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:55.342
¢Ü Yeah ¢Ü

1576
01:08:00.598 --> 01:08:03.725
This song is from the future,
but since you've been good,


1577
01:08:03.810 --> 01:08:05.060
you get it early.

1578
01:08:05.144 --> 01:08:06.812
Just like we rehearsed.

1579
01:08:07.772 --> 01:08:10.565
¢Ü Let's get it started ¢Ü

1580
01:08:10.691 --> 01:08:12.734
¢Ü in here ¢Ü

1581
01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:19.157
¢Ü And the bass keep runnin' runnin'
And runnin' runnin' ¢Ü


1582
01:08:19.242 --> 01:08:26.331
¢Ü And runnin' runnin'
And runnin' runnin' ¢Ü


1583
01:08:26.415 --> 01:08:28.667
¢Ü In this context
There's no disrespect ¢Ü


1584
01:08:28.751 --> 01:08:30.877
¢Ü So when I bust my rhyme
You break your necks ¢Ü


1585
01:08:30.962 --> 01:08:33.171
¢Ü We got five minutes
For us to disconnect ¢Ü


1586
01:08:33.256 --> 01:08:35.465
¢Ü From all intellect
Collect the rhythm effect ¢Ü


1587
01:08:35.550 --> 01:08:38.009
¢Ü So lose your inhibition
Follow your intuition ¢Ü


1588
01:08:38.094 --> 01:08:40.345
¢Ü Free your inner soul
And break away from tradition ¢Ü


1589
01:08:40.429 --> 01:08:42.180
¢Ü 'Cause when we beat out
Girl, it's putting heat out ¢Ü


1590
01:08:42.265 --> 01:08:44.724
¢Ü You wouldn't believe
How we wow shit out ¢Ü


1591
01:08:44.809 --> 01:08:46.852
¢Ü Burn it till it's burned out
Turn it till it's turned out ¢Ü


1592
01:08:46.936 --> 01:08:49.563
¢Ü Act up from north,
west, east, south ¢Ü


1593
01:08:49.647 --> 01:08:53.024
¢Ü Everybody, everybody
Let's get into it ¢Ü


1594
01:08:53.109 --> 01:08:55.360
¢Ü Get stupid
Get it started ¢Ü


1595
01:08:55.444 --> 01:08:57.195
¢Ü Get it started
Get it started ¢Ü


1596
01:08:57.280 --> 01:09:06.079
¢Ü Let's get it started
Let's get it started in here ¢Ü


1597
01:09:07.957 --> 01:09:11.126
¢Ü Everybody, everybody
Let's get into it ¢Ü


1598
01:09:11.294 --> 01:09:13.587
¢Ü Get stupid
Get it started ¢Ü


1599
01:09:13.671 --> 01:09:17.215
¢Ü Get it started, get it started
Let's get it started ¢Ü


1600
01:09:17.300 --> 01:09:19.259
Hey, where's
the Kodiak Club?


1601
01:09:19.343 --> 01:09:20.635
Down the street, dude.

1602
01:09:20.803 --> 01:09:22.596
Okay. Okay, thank you.

1603
01:09:22.763 --> 01:09:25.557
Listen, me and my boys
got some shit-kicking to do.


1604
01:09:25.850 --> 01:09:27.225
But this

1605
01:09:30.479 --> 01:09:31.646
Ain't over.

1606
01:09:32.356 --> 01:09:33.773
Get out of my way, stool.

1607
01:09:34.901 --> 01:09:37.194
¢Ü Transmit hits
with no delusion ¢Ü


1608
01:09:37.278 --> 01:09:39.946
¢Ü The feeling's irresistible
And that's how we moving ¢Ü


1609
01:09:40.114 --> 01:09:41.907
¢Ü Everybody
Everybody ¢Ü


1610
01:09:41.991 --> 01:09:43.241
¢Ü Let's get into it ¢Ü

1611
01:09:43.326 --> 01:09:44.451
That's my boy,
right there.


1612
01:09:44.619 --> 01:09:46.328
- The singer?
- Yeah.


1613
01:09:46.495 --> 01:09:48.788
¢Ü Let's get it started ¢Ü

1614
01:09:48.956 --> 01:09:51.833
I'll be back. My friends are over there.
I'll come right back.


1615
01:09:52.501 --> 01:09:54.502
¢Ü Lose control
Of body and soul ¢Ü


1616
01:09:54.587 --> 01:09:57.088
¢Ü Don't move too fast, people
Just take it slow ¢Ü


1617
01:09:57.173 --> 01:09:59.633
I'm caught right in the middle
of a thing right now,


1618
01:09:59.717 --> 01:10:01.259
but can I text you later?

1619
01:10:01.344 --> 01:10:03.094
- Can you what?
- Are you online at all?


1620
01:10:03.179 --> 01:10:04.763
I have no idea
what you're saying.


1621
01:10:04.847 --> 01:10:06.056
How do I get
a hold of you?


1622
01:10:06.140 --> 01:10:08.099
You come find me.

1623
01:10:08.184 --> 01:10:09.351
That just sounds

1624
01:10:10.269 --> 01:10:11.311
exhausting.

1625
01:10:11.771 --> 01:10:12.771
¢Ü With no delusion ¢Ü

1626
01:10:12.855 --> 01:10:15.398
¢Ü The feeling's irresistible
And that's how we moving ¢Ü


1627
01:10:15.483 --> 01:10:17.275
There he is.
Where are your boys?


1628
01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:19.110
I thought they were
gonna hold your sack.


1629
01:10:19.195 --> 01:10:20.779
Let's kick his ass, Blaine.

1630
01:10:22.490 --> 01:10:24.783
Where are my fucking friends?

1631
01:10:25.034 --> 01:10:26.534
¢Ü Whoo-hoo! 
Let's get ¢Ü

1632
01:10:26.702 --> 01:10:28.370
¢Ü Whoo-hoo! In here ¢Ü

1633
01:10:28.537 --> 01:10:30.497
¢Ü Let's get Whoo-hoo! ¢Ü

1634
01:10:30.665 --> 01:10:32.332
¢Ü While I get Whoo-hoo! ¢Ü

1635
01:10:33.084 --> 01:10:34.960
- You like that song?
- Yeah, it's great.


1636
01:10:35.044 --> 01:10:36.169
It's gonna be a hit.

1637
01:10:43.761 --> 01:10:47.681
¢Ü And runnin' runnin'
And runnin' runnin' ¢Ü


1638
01:10:52.937 --> 01:10:55.355
Thank you. Thank you.

1639
01:10:57.024 --> 01:10:58.275
Yes.

1640
01:10:58.359 --> 01:10:59.776
That was sweet.

1641
01:10:59.902 --> 01:11:01.653
All right.
All right, man.


1642
01:11:03.406 --> 01:11:05.323
Good to have you back,
see you back up there, man.


1643
01:11:05.408 --> 01:11:07.492
Hey, it's coming back.
I should have
done this years ago.


1644
01:11:07.576 --> 01:11:10.495
- Guys. Adam. Guys!
- About time.


1645
01:11:10.579 --> 01:11:12.497
Did you see him?
Did you see him rock out?


1646
01:11:12.581 --> 01:11:15.125
Shut up! Okay, we gotta find
the Chernobly to get out of here.


1647
01:11:15.293 --> 01:11:16.293
Chernobly? Why?

1648
01:11:16.377 --> 01:11:17.502
I don't know, exactly.

1649
01:11:17.586 --> 01:11:21.339
But the repairman said
it's got nitro-trainium...


1650
01:11:21.507 --> 01:11:22.882
- Nitratrinanium.
- Thank you.


1651
01:11:22.967 --> 01:11:25.593
Or some shit in it
that'll fix the time machine.


1652
01:11:25.761 --> 01:11:27.595
- That makes sense.
- Where's Lou?


1653
01:11:27.763 --> 01:11:29.764
Where is...
What time is it?


1654
01:11:30.433 --> 01:11:33.560
Fuck! Fuck! Shit! Shit!

1655
01:11:36.272 --> 01:11:37.314
Lou!

1656
01:11:38.941 --> 01:11:40.608
- Where is he?
- Fuck.


1657
01:11:42.361 --> 01:11:44.863
Oh, my God!
We missed it again!


1658
01:11:45.948 --> 01:11:47.991
Well, where do you think
he went?


1659
01:11:49.452 --> 01:11:51.286
Same place as last time?

1660
01:11:52.705 --> 01:11:56.458
¢Ü Keeps me together at the seams ¢Ü

1661
01:11:56.625 --> 01:11:59.252
¢Ü I'm on my way ¢Ü

1662
01:11:59.795 --> 01:12:01.421
Shut up, you flamer!

1663
01:12:02.089 --> 01:12:04.966
¢Ü I'm on my way ¢Ü

1664
01:12:05.801 --> 01:12:08.136
Hey, go home! Loser!

1665
01:12:08.304 --> 01:12:10.221
Hey, John Lennon gets shot!

1666
01:12:10.806 --> 01:12:12.307
Wait, did that
already happen?


1667
01:12:14.727 --> 01:12:15.894
Lou!

1668
01:12:17.313 --> 01:12:18.521
Whoo!

1669
01:12:19.398 --> 01:12:23.818
They made it, everybody!
Whoo!
Best friends in the world!


1670
01:12:23.986 --> 01:12:25.362
Almost just in time!

1671
01:12:27.114 --> 01:12:28.448
My buddies.

1672
01:12:28.616 --> 01:12:31.743
Fucking Chimney Point, right?
Here we are.


1673
01:12:31.911 --> 01:12:34.162
Bottle of scotch,
end of the night.


1674
01:12:35.831 --> 01:12:37.207
Where were you?

1675
01:12:37.416 --> 01:12:38.875
We were just...
We came...


1676
01:12:38.959 --> 01:12:40.960
Not tonight.
Every fucking night.


1677
01:12:41.504 --> 01:12:44.631
Huh? What happened?
We were gonna do shit together, man.


1678
01:12:44.715 --> 01:12:47.717
We were gonna conquer the fucking world.
Me and you.


1679
01:12:47.802 --> 01:12:49.219
And then you cut me off.

1680
01:12:49.303 --> 01:12:50.428
What was I
gonna do, man?


1681
01:12:50.513 --> 01:12:53.181
I was gonna let you drag me down
into your bullshit, Lou?


1682
01:12:53.349 --> 01:12:55.433
Yeah. Yes, because
that's what friends do.


1683
01:12:55.518 --> 01:12:56.935
No, they don't, man!

1684
01:12:57.019 --> 01:12:58.686
Because then there's two people
stuck in the bullshit


1685
01:12:58.771 --> 01:12:59.938
instead of your sorry ass.

1686
01:13:00.022 --> 01:13:04.192
You should stick by your friends
through thick and thin!


1687
01:13:07.780 --> 01:13:10.865
Okay, great.
I got two things to say to you.


1688
01:13:11.325 --> 01:13:12.617
- Okay.
- Okay?


1689
01:13:12.952 --> 01:13:15.370
Number one, I hate you.

1690
01:13:15.830 --> 01:13:16.830
Got it.

1691
01:13:16.914 --> 01:13:18.706
Our friendship means nothing.

1692
01:13:19.708 --> 01:13:21.167
All right, is that the first thing
or the second thing?


1693
01:13:21.252 --> 01:13:23.711
What? No, clearly that's still part
of the first thing.


1694
01:13:23.879 --> 01:13:25.213
- I mean, am I the asshole?
- Did you get that?


1695
01:13:25.297 --> 01:13:26.965
- No, I didn't get it. I thought...
- He didn't get it.


1696
01:13:27.049 --> 01:13:28.299
He said A and B...

1697
01:13:28.384 --> 01:13:30.802
Let's agree to disagree
about the "first" thing.


1698
01:13:30.886 --> 01:13:34.180
Lou, where is the Chernobly?
We need it to get back.


1699
01:13:34.265 --> 01:13:36.182
"Where's the Chernobly
at, Lou?"


1700
01:13:36.267 --> 01:13:38.476
That's all you ever
fucking care about.


1701
01:13:38.561 --> 01:13:39.811
It's the first time
he mentioned it.


1702
01:13:39.895 --> 01:13:41.479
Yeah, and even if we had
mentioned it before,


1703
01:13:41.564 --> 01:13:44.315
it's kind of a fucking big deal, okay?
I wanna go home.


1704
01:13:44.483 --> 01:13:45.859
Come on, Lou.
Let's talk about this inside.


1705
01:13:45.943 --> 01:13:47.152
You got no shoes on.
It's cold out.


1706
01:13:47.236 --> 01:13:48.736
Who took my fucking shoe?

1707
01:13:48.821 --> 01:13:51.281
Blaine apparently beat your shoe
off of you,


1708
01:13:51.365 --> 01:13:53.324
which I don't even know how
that could fucking happen.


1709
01:13:53.409 --> 01:13:57.370
Okay, fuck it!
Fuck you, fuck you and fuck you!


1710
01:13:57.455 --> 01:13:58.496
Easy, man.

1711
01:13:58.581 --> 01:13:59.789
Whoa, Lou!

1712
01:14:04.962 --> 01:14:06.129
I got you.

1713
01:14:06.297 --> 01:14:07.589
Oh, my God!

1714
01:14:07.756 --> 01:14:08.840
- Is Lou dead?
- Shit!


1715
01:14:09.008 --> 01:14:10.467
There he is.

1716
01:14:11.844 --> 01:14:13.011
I can't hold on.

1717
01:14:13.095 --> 01:14:14.053
Yes, you can!

1718
01:14:14.138 --> 01:14:15.180
Yes, you can hang on!

1719
01:14:15.264 --> 01:14:16.931
- I'm slipping.
- No, hold on.


1720
01:14:17.016 --> 01:14:19.017
No, Nick.
Hold on. Guys!


1721
01:14:22.146 --> 01:14:24.022
Phil! Phil!

1722
01:14:25.316 --> 01:14:26.774
Oh, fuck!

1723
01:14:26.859 --> 01:14:29.694
We're dead! This is how it happens!
This is how he loses it!


1724
01:14:29.862 --> 01:14:31.029
Fuck it!

1725
01:14:31.197 --> 01:14:33.281
Fuck it, we're dead men!
Just let me go.


1726
01:14:33.449 --> 01:14:35.033
Lou, be positive.

1727
01:14:37.453 --> 01:14:39.162
The roof is
scraping my nut!


1728
01:14:39.330 --> 01:14:41.039
Damn, you strong.

1729
01:14:44.710 --> 01:14:46.002
All right.

1730
01:14:46.170 --> 01:14:49.047
You're all right?
I'm glad you guys are all right.


1731
01:14:50.633 --> 01:14:52.133
My fault.

1732
01:14:52.301 --> 01:14:54.177
Why do you do
shit like that?


1733
01:14:54.345 --> 01:14:56.221
- I'm sorry! Jesus!
- Thank you, Phil.


1734
01:14:56.805 --> 01:14:59.265
All right, here's the second
fucking thing, okay?


1735
01:14:59.433 --> 01:15:00.892
Blaine's got the Chernobly.

1736
01:15:01.060 --> 01:15:03.478
Let's just get it from him,
so we can get back to the present


1737
01:15:03.562 --> 01:15:05.605
so I can start never seeing
you bitches again.


1738
01:15:08.234 --> 01:15:09.567
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!
- Hey.


1739
01:15:09.652 --> 01:15:11.152
I was looking for you.
Where'd you go?


1740
01:15:11.237 --> 01:15:14.072
I had to go...
My friend got in trouble, but I had to...


1741
01:15:14.156 --> 01:15:15.365
I'm leaving right now.

1742
01:15:15.533 --> 01:15:16.658
You're leaving right now?

1743
01:15:16.742 --> 01:15:17.992
- Yeah.
- That's not good.


1744
01:15:18.077 --> 01:15:19.786
I told you, I had two hours.
I gotta go.


1745
01:15:20.913 --> 01:15:24.207
Uncle Adam, come on!
Who the fuck is that chick?


1746
01:15:24.375 --> 01:15:25.500
Do you wanna come with me?

1747
01:15:25.543 --> 01:15:26.584
- Get her fax number and let's go.
- Come on.


1748
01:15:26.669 --> 01:15:28.086
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.


1749
01:15:28.170 --> 01:15:30.380
You can do whatever you want, man.
It's your life.


1750
01:15:30.464 --> 01:15:31.673
I want to.

1751
01:15:31.757 --> 01:15:32.924
Good. Then come on.

1752
01:15:33.008 --> 01:15:36.010
But I can't because my friends need me
and I gotta show up for them,


1753
01:15:37.096 --> 01:15:38.513
so I really can't.

1754
01:15:38.681 --> 01:15:39.973
Okay.

1755
01:15:41.225 --> 01:15:43.685
So what are we...
I mean, do we...


1756
01:15:44.103 --> 01:15:45.478
- What happens?
- I don't know.


1757
01:15:45.646 --> 01:15:47.146
I'm not really
making any plans.


1758
01:15:47.231 --> 01:15:49.440
I'm just sort of letting
the universe surprise me, right?


1759
01:15:49.525 --> 01:15:50.942
I like that.
I like that a lot.


1760
01:15:51.026 --> 01:15:52.110
That's the sign
of a happy man.


1761
01:15:52.194 --> 01:15:53.403
April, let's go!

1762
01:15:53.487 --> 01:15:54.696
Shit.

1763
01:15:57.157 --> 01:16:00.159
Maybe the universe will
bring us together again.


1764
01:16:00.369 --> 01:16:01.578
I hope.

1765
01:16:09.044 --> 01:16:10.712
Casanova, let's do this!

1766
01:16:20.222 --> 01:16:21.973
Just turn it around
and keep it running, okay?


1767
01:16:22.057 --> 01:16:23.474
Yeah, sure thing.

1768
01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:26.269
Okay.
You go this way,
I'll go this way?


1769
01:16:26.437 --> 01:16:27.812
No, I'm gonna do the opposite
of everything you say.


1770
01:16:27.896 --> 01:16:28.896
Great.

1771
01:16:31.317 --> 01:16:33.318
Wonder which
one's Blaine's room.


1772
01:16:36.822 --> 01:16:38.072
Housekeeping.

1773
01:16:45.247 --> 01:16:46.748
Go, go, go.

1774
01:16:59.428 --> 01:17:01.596
Let's try in here.
Where is it?


1775
01:17:03.265 --> 01:17:05.266
Come on! Come on, come on.

1776
01:17:09.605 --> 01:17:11.356
Panties, panties, panties!

1777
01:17:12.274 --> 01:17:13.733
What the fuck are you doing?

1778
01:17:13.817 --> 01:17:16.235
Why don't you shut
your slut mouth


1779
01:17:16.320 --> 01:17:18.112
and mind your own fucking business?

1780
01:17:18.197 --> 01:17:19.697
You disgust me.

1781
01:17:25.329 --> 01:17:27.830
I love how much you hate you.

1782
01:17:30.459 --> 01:17:31.584
Thank you.

1783
01:17:36.465 --> 01:17:37.757
- They're here, come on.
- Fuck!


1784
01:17:37.841 --> 01:17:39.676
"Fuck" as in, "The Chernobly's here
and we're all good"?


1785
01:17:39.760 --> 01:17:41.636
No, "fuck" as in, "fuck!"

1786
01:17:41.804 --> 01:17:42.887
Where's Nick?

1787
01:17:42.971 --> 01:17:45.473
Admit it! You sucked his balls,
you licked his booty,


1788
01:17:45.557 --> 01:17:47.308
you sucked his toes.

1789
01:17:47.476 --> 01:17:48.768
Was his dick
bigger than mine?


1790
01:17:48.852 --> 01:17:50.812
You wore the heels,
didn't you?


1791
01:17:50.896 --> 01:17:51.979
Admit it, bitch!

1792
01:17:52.856 --> 01:17:54.482
<i>There's gonna be
some changes, all right?</i>


1793
01:17:54.650 --> 01:17:56.442
First, I'm dropping
"Agnew" from my name.


1794
01:17:56.527 --> 01:17:57.568
No more hyphenate.

1795
01:17:57.653 --> 01:17:59.445
Next, I'm getting
back on stage.


1796
01:17:59.530 --> 01:18:01.906
I'm going back to music
because I jam.


1797
01:18:01.990 --> 01:18:03.408
But you wouldn't know
nothing about that


1798
01:18:03.492 --> 01:18:06.202
because you're probably
somewhere sucking a motherfucker's dick!


1799
01:18:06.829 --> 01:18:07.870
Excuse me?

1800
01:18:08.997 --> 01:18:12.375
Hang up the phone, Jerry.
This shit don't concern you.


1801
01:18:12.459 --> 01:18:13.459
How do you know my name?

1802
01:18:13.544 --> 01:18:15.420
Hang up the phone,
motherfucker!


1803
01:18:15.504 --> 01:18:17.004
This is between
me and my wife!


1804
01:18:17.798 --> 01:18:19.757
Hey! Give me that phone!

1805
01:18:19.842 --> 01:18:21.300
Give him the phone, Nick.

1806
01:18:21.385 --> 01:18:23.469
I know what I'm doing.
I know what I'm doing!


1807
01:18:23.554 --> 01:18:26.013
No, you don't, man.
Let it go! Let it go, man.


1808
01:18:26.682 --> 01:18:29.517
Wrong number.
But you're a bad girl and you hurt him.


1809
01:18:30.561 --> 01:18:32.937
Were you just yelling
at your 9-year-old wife?


1810
01:18:34.148 --> 01:18:35.148
Yes.

1811
01:18:36.859 --> 01:18:39.277
God damn it.
I'm gonna go nuclear on these guys.


1812
01:18:39.361 --> 01:18:40.486
They couldn't
have gone far, man.


1813
01:18:42.489 --> 01:18:45.158
Lou! Come on,
we gotta go.


1814
01:18:46.034 --> 01:18:47.869
- Hey.
- Hey.


1815
01:18:48.287 --> 01:18:49.454
Mom?

1816
01:18:49.538 --> 01:18:50.830
Hey, did you find the Chernobly?

1817
01:18:50.914 --> 01:18:52.039
You motherfucker!

1818
01:18:53.834 --> 01:18:55.626
- Where did he go?
- Jacob?


1819
01:18:55.711 --> 01:18:57.628
- What the fuck?
- What's happened?


1820
01:19:00.716 --> 01:19:02.800
Oh, my God. I get it.

1821
01:19:03.927 --> 01:19:05.344
I'm his father.

1822
01:19:05.429 --> 01:19:06.512
What?

1823
01:19:09.683 --> 01:19:11.058
Wait, so what do we do?

1824
01:19:11.143 --> 01:19:12.226
Oh, my God.

1825
01:19:14.271 --> 01:19:15.396
Hit that.

1826
01:19:17.649 --> 01:19:19.192
You finish this.

1827
01:19:20.444 --> 01:19:21.569
Okay.

1828
01:19:21.862 --> 01:19:25.698
Lay down.
We got a stupid baby to make right now.


1829
01:19:26.241 --> 01:19:28.242
I'm back inside of you.

1830
01:19:29.161 --> 01:19:32.789
I can't believe I'm
fucking Adam's sister!


1831
01:19:32.873 --> 01:19:35.708
I'm doing it!
I'm doing it!


1832
01:19:36.293 --> 01:19:39.128
It's gonna take me a while
'cause I'm a little drunk.


1833
01:19:39.296 --> 01:19:40.630
Oh, no, it's not.
Here I come.


1834
01:19:40.798 --> 01:19:43.716
Oh, my God, I'm gonna come!
I'm gonna...


1835
01:19:43.884 --> 01:19:46.302
Oh, Shia LaBeouf!

1836
01:19:46.470 --> 01:19:48.888
Dropping loads!

1837
01:19:49.223 --> 01:19:53.476
So much fucking semen.
Little tiny Jacobs!


1838
01:19:56.939 --> 01:19:59.232
There's my boy.

1839
01:19:59.399 --> 01:20:02.026
It was so beautiful.
You sack of shit!


1840
01:20:04.530 --> 01:20:06.697
I knew there was a reason
I fucking hated you.


1841
01:20:06.865 --> 01:20:07.990
And now I know why.

1842
01:20:08.075 --> 01:20:11.369
I'm gonna tell everybody in prison that
I traveled back in time


1843
01:20:11.453 --> 01:20:12.954
to kill my own father!

1844
01:20:13.080 --> 01:20:14.997
- Jacob, get off him. Come on!
- Time out, young man.


1845
01:20:15.082 --> 01:20:17.875
Get the fuck off of me!
You're a fucking dead man!


1846
01:20:17.960 --> 01:20:19.001
Jacob!

1847
01:20:19.086 --> 01:20:20.545
Nobody fucks my mother
in the past!


1848
01:20:20.629 --> 01:20:22.421
I feel pregnant.

1849
01:20:23.632 --> 01:20:25.132
You're welcome.

1850
01:20:33.308 --> 01:20:34.851
You Commies looking for this?

1851
01:20:34.935 --> 01:20:36.143
- Yes, actually.
- Yes, we are.


1852
01:20:36.228 --> 01:20:37.478
That's what
we're looking for.


1853
01:20:37.563 --> 01:20:38.813
You think we could get that back?

1854
01:20:38.897 --> 01:20:40.022
No, you may not.

1855
01:20:40.107 --> 01:20:43.192
But bad news for you, sport.
I'm a patriot.


1856
01:20:43.277 --> 01:20:45.486
And I'm not about to let some
Ruskie fucks come into my town


1857
01:20:45.571 --> 01:20:48.155
and blow shit up with
some red-soda-can bomb.


1858
01:20:48.240 --> 01:20:49.824
Just give it to us,
turtleneck.


1859
01:20:49.908 --> 01:20:52.326
Yeah, okay,
you can have it back.


1860
01:20:52.494 --> 01:20:55.496
As long as that sack over there
comes and takes it from me.


1861
01:20:56.665 --> 01:20:58.249
- I think he's talking about you.
- He's talking about you.


1862
01:20:58.333 --> 01:20:59.834
He's obviously
talking about me.


1863
01:21:03.213 --> 01:21:04.547
Blaine, hello.

1864
01:21:05.090 --> 01:21:06.173
Um...

1865
01:21:06.508 --> 01:21:08.426
Can I please
get the soda back?


1866
01:21:08.594 --> 01:21:09.844
Yeah, sure you can.

1867
01:21:10.846 --> 01:21:11.846
Oh.

1868
01:21:11.930 --> 01:21:13.180
Okay.

1869
01:21:15.434 --> 01:21:17.101
Fuck me in the face.

1870
01:21:17.185 --> 01:21:18.853
Get him
a body bag, Blaine!


1871
01:21:19.229 --> 01:21:21.606
Give us a minute, okay?
Listen to me, man.


1872
01:21:22.024 --> 01:21:26.694
That guy, that guy has pummeled you
again and again.


1873
01:21:26.862 --> 01:21:28.195
He made you
his little bitch.


1874
01:21:28.363 --> 01:21:30.907
He's humiliated you,
emasculated you.


1875
01:21:31.074 --> 01:21:34.577
The wheel of fate has stopped
and dumped you here again,


1876
01:21:34.661 --> 01:21:35.953
utterly defeated.

1877
01:21:36.413 --> 01:21:38.122
None of this is
helping me at all.


1878
01:21:38.206 --> 01:21:39.749
I know, it's coming.
It's coming right now.


1879
01:21:39.833 --> 01:21:40.833
Patience.

1880
01:21:40.918 --> 01:21:42.668
Maybe you're supposed to do
something different.


1881
01:21:42.753 --> 01:21:45.004
What is this, girl talk?
Let's go here, come on.


1882
01:21:45.088 --> 01:21:46.547
You're better than him.

1883
01:21:46.632 --> 01:21:47.882
America!

1884
01:21:47.966 --> 01:21:50.051
Maybe not by a lot,
but a little.


1885
01:21:50.218 --> 01:21:52.720
You're the patron saint
of the totally fucked.


1886
01:21:52.888 --> 01:21:56.390
You're completely toxic.
There's nothing you can't kill.


1887
01:21:56.558 --> 01:21:58.351
You're the fucking Violator!

1888
01:21:58.435 --> 01:21:59.977
The moment's over.
Let's go!


1889
01:22:00.062 --> 01:22:03.397
You can do this!
You can get us the fuck out of here!


1890
01:22:03.565 --> 01:22:05.066
You can be the hero!

1891
01:22:05.233 --> 01:22:06.817
Enrique-fucking-lglesias.

1892
01:22:06.902 --> 01:22:08.319
You love that song,
don't you?


1893
01:22:08.403 --> 01:22:10.154
I love that fucking song!

1894
01:22:10.238 --> 01:22:12.073
Give me your best shot.
Come on, buddy.


1895
01:22:13.450 --> 01:22:16.369
¢Ü I can be your hero, baby ¢Ü

1896
01:22:19.206 --> 01:22:22.667
¢Ü I can kiss away the pain ¢Ü

1897
01:22:25.337 --> 01:22:29.131
¢Ü I will stand by you forever ¢Ü

1898
01:22:31.009 --> 01:22:35.680
¢Ü You can take my breath away ¢Ü

1899
01:22:36.598 --> 01:22:38.015
Shit.

1900
01:22:38.100 --> 01:22:41.560
God damn it!
None of what you said worked at all.


1901
01:22:42.437 --> 01:22:44.397
Let's kick these guys' ass,
get the shit and go home.


1902
01:22:44.481 --> 01:22:45.523
Done.

1903
01:22:45.607 --> 01:22:46.941
No, no!

1904
01:22:54.992 --> 01:22:57.493
Fuck you! Feels so good!

1905
01:22:57.661 --> 01:22:58.869
The Chernobly.

1906
01:23:09.381 --> 01:23:10.881
Martina Navratilova.

1907
01:23:10.966 --> 01:23:12.299
Smirnoff Ice.

1908
01:23:14.636 --> 01:23:16.595
That's right,
we are Russians! Spies.


1909
01:23:17.472 --> 01:23:19.056
Yeah, because I was
just speaking Russian.


1910
01:23:19.141 --> 01:23:21.809
He pulls that top,
and this whole fucking place blows.


1911
01:23:21.977 --> 01:23:25.771
You guys count backwards from 50,
then pull up the carpet and jump around.


1912
01:23:25.939 --> 01:23:27.481
Or I'll fuck you up.

1913
01:23:31.486 --> 01:23:34.488
Hi, Phil.
Can we go back to the hotel, lodge?


1914
01:23:34.656 --> 01:23:36.323
- Sure.
- Thank you so much.


1915
01:23:38.410 --> 01:23:40.578
Five, four, three...

1916
01:23:40.662 --> 01:23:43.038
Blaine, please stop counting.

1917
01:23:43.123 --> 01:23:46.250
Chaz, this is
an Acorn 5 situation.


1918
01:23:46.334 --> 01:23:48.711
If we stop counting,
they're gonna blow us sky-high.


1919
01:23:48.795 --> 01:23:51.589
Look, if it is a bomb,
they've got it with them, all right?


1920
01:23:51.673 --> 01:23:52.923
If anyone's gonna blow up,
it's them.


1921
01:23:53.008 --> 01:23:54.508
Chaz, stop!

1922
01:23:56.178 --> 01:23:57.636
How long did
our talking just take?


1923
01:23:57.721 --> 01:23:58.971
I don't know.
I wasn't keeping track.


1924
01:23:59.055 --> 01:24:01.015
Fuck it, let's risk it!

1925
01:24:01.099 --> 01:24:02.099
Move out!

1926
01:24:02.642 --> 01:24:05.227
Now that you're with me,
you gotta cover up your belly.


1927
01:24:05.312 --> 01:24:06.520
Let's get
the fuck out of here.


1928
01:24:06.605 --> 01:24:08.481
What are you talking about?
We only had sex once.


1929
01:24:08.565 --> 01:24:10.858
Let's go. Come on.
Kelly, you can
talk about it later.


1930
01:24:10.942 --> 01:24:11.942
You guys are all right?

1931
01:24:12.027 --> 01:24:13.444
Thank you, Phil.
Enjoyed it.


1932
01:24:13.528 --> 01:24:15.696
Have a good rest
of your vacation.


1933
01:24:15.781 --> 01:24:19.450
We'd love to have you come back here
to the Silver Peaks Lodge.


1934
01:24:19.534 --> 01:24:21.619
- Thanks. Bye-bye.
- Thanks, Phil. Take care.


1935
01:24:21.703 --> 01:24:22.787
Be careful.

1936
01:24:22.871 --> 01:24:23.829
Hey, watch out!

1937
01:24:26.291 --> 01:24:28.793
God, you guys see that?

1938
01:24:28.877 --> 01:24:30.461
Come on, man!

1939
01:24:30.545 --> 01:24:32.296
Why would you
fucking take that from me?


1940
01:24:32.380 --> 01:24:34.089
I didn't take it from you.

1941
01:24:34.174 --> 01:24:35.508
You guys...

1942
01:24:37.969 --> 01:24:40.805
It happened!
It happened!


1943
01:24:45.101 --> 01:24:48.229
Why the fuck
are you laughing? Gross!


1944
01:24:51.066 --> 01:24:53.192
Man down, man down!
Code 11.


1945
01:24:53.276 --> 01:24:56.070
All right, everybody grab your gear,
we gotta move!


1946
01:24:58.073 --> 01:24:59.406
Later, Kelly.

1947
01:24:59.991 --> 01:25:02.451
Bye, Mom. Love you.
Don't do drugs, okay?


1948
01:25:02.536 --> 01:25:03.953
Hey, bye.

1949
01:25:05.205 --> 01:25:06.330
Aren't you coming
to my room with me?


1950
01:25:06.414 --> 01:25:07.456
No, I gotta take
my clothes off


1951
01:25:07.541 --> 01:25:09.333
and get in a hot
tub with these guys.


1952
01:25:09.751 --> 01:25:11.001
Then I'm totally
over you.


1953
01:25:11.086 --> 01:25:13.087
Kelly, listen.
It's been an interesting trip.


1954
01:25:13.171 --> 01:25:15.464
You're my sister
and I love you.


1955
01:25:15.799 --> 01:25:17.424
I love you, too.

1956
01:25:17.676 --> 01:25:19.927
And don't steal
that Caboodle makeup thing from JCPenney


1957
01:25:20.011 --> 01:25:21.303
and you won't do
any hard time.


1958
01:25:21.388 --> 01:25:22.972
I'll see you in 20 years.

1959
01:25:23.265 --> 01:25:25.933
Uh. You're giving me a ride
in the morning, right?


1960
01:25:28.937 --> 01:25:30.312
Hallelujah!

1961
01:25:31.523 --> 01:25:33.023
Cannonball!

1962
01:25:35.610 --> 01:25:37.778
Yeah! Let's get
this party started!


1963
01:25:38.280 --> 01:25:39.697
Young blood.

1964
01:25:43.618 --> 01:25:44.618
Holy shit!

1965
01:25:44.703 --> 01:25:45.870
Hey, look,
it's happening.


1966
01:25:46.288 --> 01:25:47.746
Here it comes!

1967
01:25:50.292 --> 01:25:53.085
Hurry up.
I can see the '90s.


1968
01:25:53.169 --> 01:25:54.795
Why are you taking
off your clothes?


1969
01:25:54.880 --> 01:25:57.047
I don't know, man.
It just feels right, you know?


1970
01:25:57.132 --> 01:25:58.257
Fuck it.

1971
01:25:58.466 --> 01:26:02.386
Adam! Adam!
I'm not gonna go!


1972
01:26:02.971 --> 01:26:04.847
- What?
- I'm gonna stay!


1973
01:26:04.931 --> 01:26:06.974
Don't fuck around, Lou.
Let's go!


1974
01:26:07.475 --> 01:26:09.226
I'm good here, man.

1975
01:26:09.311 --> 01:26:12.980
I had a good day!
I beat the shit out of that guy, finally!


1976
01:26:13.231 --> 01:26:14.732
I fucked your sister!

1977
01:26:15.150 --> 01:26:16.942
I could be a good dad!

1978
01:26:17.027 --> 01:26:18.736
I love you, Jacob!

1979
01:26:18.820 --> 01:26:20.321
Fuck you!

1980
01:26:21.615 --> 01:26:25.034
Little scamp. They say
the damndest things, man.


1981
01:26:25.118 --> 01:26:27.995
Come on, Lou, let's go!
We'll talk about it when we get home!


1982
01:26:28.330 --> 01:26:30.623
I was trying
to kill myself!


1983
01:26:33.251 --> 01:26:35.544
I know, man.
That's why we came here!


1984
01:26:35.629 --> 01:26:40.382
If I go back, I'm just
gonna kill myself all over again, man.


1985
01:26:40.467 --> 01:26:42.343
- I can't.
- You're gonna stay?


1986
01:26:42.594 --> 01:26:44.178
Guys, let's go.

1987
01:26:44.262 --> 01:26:45.930
All right, well, if you're gonna stay,
I'm gonna stay!


1988
01:26:46.014 --> 01:26:47.556
You'd really
do that for me?


1989
01:26:47.641 --> 01:26:50.517
We're best friends!
If you're staying, I'm staying!


1990
01:26:50.602 --> 01:26:52.394
Your bullshit's
my bullshit, right?


1991
01:26:52.771 --> 01:26:54.355
I'm your best friend?

1992
01:26:54.439 --> 01:26:56.398
You are one of
my best friends!


1993
01:26:56.483 --> 01:26:57.441
I'll take that!

1994
01:26:57.525 --> 01:26:58.817
Where you going on me?

1995
01:26:58.902 --> 01:26:59.985
Thank you!

1996
01:27:00.070 --> 01:27:01.278
Oh, my God!

1997
01:27:01.905 --> 01:27:03.781
All right, man. Come on!

1998
01:27:47.325 --> 01:27:48.742
Holy shit.

1999
01:27:49.160 --> 01:27:51.912
This better be the last time
my ass travels through time.


2000
01:28:13.601 --> 01:28:14.643
Oh...

2001
01:28:15.353 --> 01:28:17.521
It is so good
to see you.


2002
01:28:19.858 --> 01:28:21.150
<i>Are we rolling?</i>

2003
01:28:22.110 --> 01:28:24.278
<i>Welcome back, bitches!</i>

2004
01:28:24.446 --> 01:28:25.612
Is that Lou?

2005
01:28:25.780 --> 01:28:28.198
What took you so long?
All right, zoom out.


2006
01:28:28.283 --> 01:28:29.783
Yeah, that's
a weird hair choice.


2007
01:28:29.868 --> 01:28:32.453
Uh-oh. Look what Daddy did.

2008
01:28:32.704 --> 01:28:33.787
He looks like a lion.

2009
01:28:34.956 --> 01:28:37.041
Oh, hi.
Didn't see you there.


2010
01:28:37.959 --> 01:28:38.959
Here's a question.

2011
01:28:39.044 --> 01:28:42.046
Was it morally wrong for me
to exploit my knowledge of the future


2012
01:28:42.130 --> 01:28:43.881
for personal financial gain?

2013
01:28:43.965 --> 01:28:45.299
Perhaps.

2014
01:28:45.383 --> 01:28:46.925
Here's another question.

2015
01:28:47.010 --> 01:28:48.510
Do I give a fuck?

2016
01:28:48.595 --> 01:28:49.636
That's my father.

2017
01:28:49.721 --> 01:28:51.889
Hey, check out my girl.

2018
01:28:51.973 --> 01:28:53.724
You burned the fucking crab
cakes again.


2019
01:28:53.808 --> 01:28:57.269
<i>No, I didn't burn them
because I like them that way!</i>


2020
01:28:57.353 --> 01:28:59.313
I fucking hate you, Louis.

2021
01:28:59.397 --> 01:29:00.731
I hate you, too, baby.

2022
01:29:01.649 --> 01:29:03.233
I love that woman, man.

2023
01:29:03.318 --> 01:29:04.860
Those are my parents.

2024
01:29:04.944 --> 01:29:06.737
But seriously,
a lot has changed.


2025
01:29:06.821 --> 01:29:10.866
So, whatever happens,
stay the fuck calm.


2026
01:29:11.659 --> 01:29:13.077
It'll all make sense soon.

2027
01:29:23.046 --> 01:29:24.088
Good morning.

2028
01:29:24.172 --> 01:29:26.423
Holy shit,
Phil, you got both your arms.


2029
01:29:26.508 --> 01:29:28.342
Oh. Yeah, I do.

2030
01:29:28.426 --> 01:29:29.593
That's incredible.

2031
01:29:29.677 --> 01:29:32.971
Yeah, what happened was
a snowplow came along


2032
01:29:33.056 --> 01:29:34.765
and it took my arm right off.

2033
01:29:34.849 --> 01:29:37.684
<i>But the ski patrol came along
and they put it on ice.</i>


2034
01:29:37.769 --> 01:29:40.062
Blaine and Chaz.
Blaine and Chaz saved his arm!


2035
01:29:40.146 --> 01:29:42.272
We got 15 minutes
before that thing dies, all right.


2036
01:29:42.357 --> 01:29:43.816
We're gonna put
that back on you!


2037
01:29:43.900 --> 01:29:45.484
<i>I'm pretty happy.</i>

2038
01:29:45.568 --> 01:29:46.610
It looks great.

2039
01:29:46.694 --> 01:29:49.113
Anyhow, I have instructions
on how to get home.


2040
01:29:49.197 --> 01:29:50.489
We know how to get home.

2041
01:29:50.573 --> 01:29:51.949
Yeah. We know...

2042
01:29:52.033 --> 01:29:54.868
Mr. Dorchen anticipated
that you might say that,


2043
01:29:54.994 --> 01:29:57.830
so I took the liberty
of printing up some Lougle maps for you.


2044
01:29:58.039 --> 01:29:59.790
- You mean "Google"?
- Lougle maps.


2045
01:29:59.874 --> 01:30:02.000
What's the matter with you guys?

2046
01:30:05.380 --> 01:30:06.505
Fuck me.

2047
01:30:06.589 --> 01:30:09.633
So, Phil, if you wanna find,
you know, like porno


2048
01:30:09.717 --> 01:30:12.511
or a restaurant review
or anything like that, you use Lougle?


2049
01:30:12.762 --> 01:30:13.929
Correct.

2050
01:30:14.222 --> 01:30:16.390
I bet he's on
the Statue of Liberty and shit, too.


2051
01:30:20.728 --> 01:30:22.354
You want me to go in there?

2052
01:30:22.438 --> 01:30:24.690
That's what
it says on the map.


2053
01:30:27.277 --> 01:30:28.485
Call me later.

2054
01:30:31.239 --> 01:30:32.364
Hello.

2055
01:30:37.036 --> 01:30:39.121
Welcome back, Mr. Webber.
How was your time away?


2056
01:30:40.915 --> 01:30:42.040
Uh...

2057
01:30:43.877 --> 01:30:46.962
Hey, how was the trip?

2058
01:30:51.759 --> 01:30:52.926
Good.

2059
01:30:53.261 --> 01:30:55.387
¢Ü Letting the days go by ¢Ü

2060
01:30:55.471 --> 01:30:57.556
¢Ü Let the water hold me down ¢Ü

2061
01:30:57.640 --> 01:30:59.516
¢Ü Letting the days go by ¢Ü

2062
01:30:59.601 --> 01:31:01.685
¢Ü Water flowing underground ¢Ü

2063
01:31:01.769 --> 01:31:03.729
¢Ü Into the blue again ¢Ü

2064
01:31:03.813 --> 01:31:05.689
¢Ü After the money's gone ¢Ü

2065
01:31:05.773 --> 01:31:07.733
¢Ü Once in a lifetime ¢Ü

2066
01:31:07.817 --> 01:31:10.569
¢Ü Water flowing underground ¢Ü

2067
01:31:10.653 --> 01:31:11.945
Motherfucker.

2068
01:31:13.114 --> 01:31:14.281
Nick?

2069
01:31:14.741 --> 01:31:17.951
Baby, how was your weekend?
I wasn't expecting you today.


2070
01:31:19.829 --> 01:31:22.789
Baby. Baby.
I got something to tell you.


2071
01:31:23.124 --> 01:31:25.918
I know about what you did
with a guy named Steve.


2072
01:31:27.128 --> 01:31:29.838
Steve?
Our receptionist?


2073
01:31:30.006 --> 01:31:31.965
That Tyrese-looking
motherfucker out there?


2074
01:31:32.133 --> 01:31:35.302
Baby, wait a minute.
What are you talking about?


2075
01:31:35.470 --> 01:31:37.054
You think I'm fooling around?

2076
01:31:37.138 --> 01:31:39.932
First of all, I would never screw around.

2077
01:31:40.308 --> 01:31:44.019
And you remember I told you about that crazy
wrong number I got when I was nine.


2078
01:31:44.103 --> 01:31:45.604
- That man was so...
- I love you, Courtney.


2079
01:31:45.688 --> 01:31:47.397
I love you so much.

2080
01:31:47.482 --> 01:31:49.608
I love you, too,
Nick Webber.


2081
01:31:50.318 --> 01:31:51.526
Nick Webber?

2082
01:31:52.320 --> 01:31:53.487
That's your name.

2083
01:31:54.614 --> 01:31:56.323
Yeah, it is my name.

2084
01:31:56.908 --> 01:31:57.908
Yeah.

2085
01:31:57.992 --> 01:32:00.160
You know my name.
Say it again.


2086
01:32:00.245 --> 01:32:01.411
Nick

2087
01:32:01.496 --> 01:32:02.913
- Webber.
- Yeah.


2088
01:32:03.957 --> 01:32:05.832
Grab that.
I'll take this one.


2089
01:32:06.334 --> 01:32:08.126
Hey, Mom.
I made you a drink.


2090
01:32:08.419 --> 01:32:09.920
Is there alcohol in that?

2091
01:32:10.004 --> 01:32:11.672
Yeah, I believe
there's still alcohol in scotch.


2092
01:32:13.716 --> 01:32:15.217
Talk about your
lost weekend, huh?


2093
01:32:15.301 --> 01:32:17.177
I know, right? Man.

2094
01:32:17.887 --> 01:32:19.888
Hey, family.

2095
01:32:21.182 --> 01:32:22.808
What are you faggots talking about?

2096
01:32:22.976 --> 01:32:24.851
My two handsome men.

2097
01:32:25.019 --> 01:32:26.937
Let me get you another drink, Dad.

2098
01:32:27.689 --> 01:32:29.314
Daddy's little buddy.

2099
01:32:31.025 --> 01:32:32.651
You know what I can't believe?

2100
01:32:33.027 --> 01:32:34.653
I can't believe we're all here.

2101
01:32:34.821 --> 01:32:36.363
I can't believe we all made it.

2102
01:32:36.864 --> 01:32:38.031
Made it together.

2103
01:32:38.366 --> 01:32:39.700
- A toast.
- A toast.


2104
01:32:39.784 --> 01:32:42.119
Approximately three days ago, or 20 years,

2105
01:32:42.203 --> 01:32:45.038
depending on your understanding
of the time-space continuum, Jacob,


2106
01:32:46.082 --> 01:32:48.750
sitting here with you guys
would have been my worst nightmare.


2107
01:32:48.835 --> 01:32:50.085
It's true.

2108
01:32:50.169 --> 01:32:52.004
But I can honestly say right now

2109
01:32:52.463 --> 01:32:56.300
I'm very happy to be right here
in this moment with you,


2110
01:32:56.676 --> 01:32:58.218
- my best friends.
- Hear, hear.


2111
01:32:58.303 --> 01:32:59.344
To friends.

2112
01:32:59.429 --> 01:33:00.470
And family.

2113
01:33:00.930 --> 01:33:02.055
All right. Cheers!

2114
01:33:02.223 --> 01:33:03.598
To past, present and future.

2115
01:33:03.891 --> 01:33:05.642
Cheers!

2116
01:33:05.727 --> 01:33:06.685
So, "Lougle," huh?

2117
01:33:06.769 --> 01:33:07.811
Yeah.

2118
01:33:07.895 --> 01:33:11.231
Lougle. Just this multibillion-dollar
thing I did for a while.


2119
01:33:12.025 --> 01:33:15.235
My real passion's music, though.
So pissed the band broke up.


2120
01:33:15.403 --> 01:33:17.738
Band? What band
were you ever in?


2121
01:33:29.542 --> 01:33:32.919
¢Ü You know I'm a dreamer ¢Ü

2122
01:33:33.087 --> 01:33:36.298
¢Ü But my heart's of gold ¢Ü

2123
01:33:36.549 --> 01:33:39.509
¢Ü I had to run away high ¢Ü

2124
01:33:39.594 --> 01:33:42.137
¢Ü So I wouldn't come home low ¢Ü

2125
01:33:42.263 --> 01:33:45.349
¢Ü Just when things went right ¢Ü

2126
01:33:45.433 --> 01:33:48.352
¢Ü Doesn't mean
they were always wrong ¢Ü


2127
01:33:48.686 --> 01:33:52.898
¢Ü Just take this song
and you'll never feel ¢Ü


2128
01:33:53.066 --> 01:33:54.941
¢Ü Left all alone ¢Ü

2129
01:33:55.026 --> 01:33:58.070
¢Ü Take me to your heart ¢Ü

2130
01:33:58.404 --> 01:34:01.031
¢Ü Feel me in your bones ¢Ü

2131
01:34:01.115 --> 01:34:03.278
¢Ü Just one more night ¢Ü

2132
01:34:03.279 --> 01:34:08.080
¢Ü And I'm coming off this
long and winding road ¢Ü


2133
01:34:11.084 --> 01:34:16.755
¢Ü I'm on my way ¢Ü

2134
01:34:16.839 --> 01:34:20.300
¢Ü Home sweet home ¢Ü

2135
01:34:21.302 --> 01:34:23.553
¢Ü Tonight, tonight ¢Ü

2136
01:34:23.721 --> 01:34:29.226
¢Ü I'm on my way ¢Ü

2137
01:34:29.435 --> 01:34:32.479
¢Ü Home sweet home ¢Ü

2138
01:34:36.150 --> 01:34:39.111
¢Ü You know that I've seen ¢Ü

2139
01:34:39.278 --> 01:34:41.905
¢Ü Too many romantic dreams ¢Ü

2140
01:34:42.740 --> 01:34:44.157
¢Ü Up in lights ¢Ü

2141
