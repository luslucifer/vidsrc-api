00:00:04.772 --> 00:00:07.355
(hammer bangs)

2
00:00:08.696 --> 00:00:11.419
Pin on your diapers,
Charlie, and hit that nail.


3
00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:13.332
(hammer bangs)

4
00:00:13.332 --> 00:00:15.201
(birds chirping)

5
00:00:15.201 --> 00:00:17.000
There you have it, Charlie.

6
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.143
Twin Pines is finally complete.

7
00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.963
And one day, all of
this is gonna be yours.


8
00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:28.673
Don't fuck it up.

9
00:00:29.634 --> 00:00:32.384
(birds chirping)

10
00:00:44.723 --> 00:00:45.753
[Man] Fore!

11
00:00:45.753 --> 00:00:48.644
(golf club bangs)

12
00:00:48.644 --> 00:00:51.394
(drink whizzing)

13
00:01:02.237 --> 00:01:05.237
(golf club strikes)

14
00:01:06.717 --> 00:01:09.467
(lighter clicks)

15
00:01:13.111 --> 00:01:16.194
(golf cart whirring)

16
00:01:28.117 --> 00:01:29.700
Hola, Mr. Conroy!

17
00:01:31.298 --> 00:01:33.754
Buenos Dias, Eñejo!

18
00:01:33.754 --> 00:01:36.337
(Eñejo cheers)

19
00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:38.563
Amigo, amigo.

20
00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.670
[Fred] Boss, are you here yet?

21
00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.322
Son of a bitch!

22
00:01:47.322 --> 00:01:48.155
(Conroy grunts)

23
00:01:48.155 --> 00:01:48.988
What?

24
00:01:48.988 --> 00:01:50.530
[Fred] We need an exterminator.

25
00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.000
Just call the cheapest one you can find.

26
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.360
No more than three stars.

27
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.763
[Fred] You also need someone

28
00:01:54.763 --> 00:01:57.430
that will generally run this club,

29
00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.780
and not just run it into the ground.

30
00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.920
Little harsh for 8:00 a.m. Fred.

31
00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.820
[Fred] How's that morning latte, Conroy?

32
00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.090
Oh, it was going great
until you fucked it up.


33
00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.650
[Fred] So you'll black out
five minutes later than usual?


34
00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:11.970
If I'm lucky.
[Fred] Perfect,


35
00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.444
I will update the schedule.

36
00:02:14.444 --> 00:02:17.527
(golf cart whirring)

37
00:02:38.708 --> 00:02:42.069
(phone ringing)

38
00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:43.188
[Jake] Pop, phone.

39
00:02:44.724 --> 00:02:45.702
(phone ringing)

40
00:02:45.702 --> 00:02:47.194
Pop,

41
00:02:47.194 --> 00:02:48.527
phone's ringing.

42
00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.010
[Pop] What the hell
do I pay you for?

43
00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.640
The phone's right behind you, you weirdo.

44
00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:55.473
Just answer it.

45
00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.280
[Man On TV] Trust me. She
wants the whole shaft.


46
00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.330
Roach Smokers.

47
00:03:01.474 --> 00:03:02.659
Yes, ma'am.

48
00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:04.409
And where is this at?

49
00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.363
Twin Pines Country Club.

50
00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:12.357
I'm gonna send my best
man over there right now.


51
00:03:13.322 --> 00:03:14.989
Thank you very much.

52
00:03:17.157 --> 00:03:19.102
You hired someone new?

53
00:03:19.102 --> 00:03:22.745
Would you rather me
lower their expectations?


54
00:03:22.745 --> 00:03:23.618
You could.

55
00:03:23.618 --> 00:03:25.723
Might set a better precedent.

56
00:03:25.723 --> 00:03:29.100
Turn the damn TV off and
get your ass to work.


57
00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.933
You want this off?

58
00:03:29.933 --> 00:03:30.766
Helps you sleep.

59
00:03:30.766 --> 00:03:35.270
You relive your glory days
on someone else's time.


60
00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:38.260
The only future you have in golf

61
00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.960
is at Twin Pines killing bugs.

62
00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:45.180
Ouch, that was so mean.

63
00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.070
Also, I've been hitting the
driving range every Wednesday,


64
00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.903
thank you very much.

65
00:03:47.903 --> 00:03:50.070
Oh, does Brandy know about this?

66
00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:51.110
Oh God, no.

67
00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:53.870
Please don't tell her also
that'd be a massive problem.


68
00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:54.703
Get your ass out here and
make me some damn money.


69
00:03:54.703 --> 00:03:55.536
Okay, I love you so much.

70
00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.180
Hope you say it back someday.

71
00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:00.363
Yeah, I bet you do.

72
00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:06.722
(car engine revving)

73
00:04:08.655 --> 00:04:11.738
(golf cart whirring)

74
00:04:14.566 --> 00:04:16.037
Oh, not again.

75
00:04:16.037 --> 00:04:19.120
(golf cart whirring)

76
00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:22.773
Ms. Gladys, you okay?

77
00:04:23.938 --> 00:04:25.523
[Gladys] Yeah, I'm fine.

78
00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:27.920
(Gladys belches)

79
00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.670
Dehydrated.

80
00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:31.423
I'll send Emily over, stat.

81
00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.430
Gladys needs a little assistance
by the ninth hole Tee.


82
00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:36.263
Copy?

83
00:04:36.263 --> 00:04:37.096
Copy that, on my way.

84
00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:42.350
(siren wailing)

85
00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:43.183
10-4.

86
00:04:43.183 --> 00:04:44.963
Emily's gonna bring you beer, Ms. Gladys.

87
00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.137
We're good.

88
00:04:47.137 --> 00:04:50.220
(golf cart whirring)

89
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.093
Fuckers.

90
00:05:07.998 --> 00:05:11.081
(golf carts buzzing)

91
00:05:15.892 --> 00:05:17.142
Shane, Jesus!

92
00:05:19.428 --> 00:05:20.845
What's up boss?

93
00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:26.320
Shainski had a big night,
sex with a dude, again.


94
00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.830
It's called being experimental, Mikels,

95
00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:31.690
and dude was actually
quite the gentleman...


96
00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:34.350
and pretty fucking sexy.

97
00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:35.183
Told you.

98
00:05:35.183 --> 00:05:36.016
You guys gonna clean this up?

99
00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:38.690
[Shainski] Hey, Linda!

100
00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:39.523
[Shainski] It's raining
men, girl, let's go!


101
00:05:39.523 --> 00:05:40.356
...Let's get some drinks!

102
00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:48.087
(door bangs)

103
00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:53.510
Charlie, we've gotta
get this place together.


104
00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:55.730
Fred, honey, take it easy.

105
00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:57.010
Exterminator's on his way.

106
00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:58.420
Great, see if he'll cut us a deal.

107
00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:59.640
Yeah, how?

108
00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:01.200
Maybe he likes golf.

109
00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:02.940
Dixie Classic tournament...

110
00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:04.180
Ready to lose again?

111
00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:05.750
Won't be difficult.

112
00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:07.140
It's our year to host.

113
00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:08.480
A little patchwork on the greens.

114
00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:10.151
Call it good, and goodbye.

115
00:06:10.151 --> 00:06:11.360
And another thing.

116
00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:12.750
Fred, you are killing my buzz.

117
00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:15.720
Jarvis Boyd is the tournament
director this year,


118
00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.640
and you know his
inspections can be a bitch.


119
00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:20.450
He is not gonna give
Charlie Conroy any breaks.


120
00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:22.600
Twin Pines is of course for normal people.

121
00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:23.940
I'll keep it that way.

122
00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:26.250
There's a new rule
in the Dixie this year.

123
00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:27.083
Oh, more good news.

124
00:06:27.083 --> 00:06:28.170
Any club that hasn't won

125
00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:30.200
in a 15 year tournament cycle is out.

126
00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:31.600
Spell it out for me, Fred.

127
00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:34.633
We have to win the Dixie Classic.

128
00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:38.740
Or, hear me,

129
00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:40.590
say goodbye to this stupid tradition!

130
00:06:41.623 --> 00:06:43.000
It's a dumb name anyway,

131
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:43.950
What year is it?

132
00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:46.160
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

133
00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:47.233
[Nick] Morning, everyone!

134
00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:49.393
Connie!

135
00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:52.073
What's shaking?

136
00:06:52.073 --> 00:06:54.380
It's our year to host the Dixie,

137
00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:55.773
you need to get this place in shape.

138
00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:58.410
What was that?

139
00:06:58.410 --> 00:06:59.400
What.

140
00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:00.310
I think I just cut you off.

141
00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:01.620
I wasn't even speaking, Nick.

142
00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:02.883
Oh, oh.

143
00:07:04.477 --> 00:07:06.000
(opens beer)

144
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:06.850
Good answer.

145
00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:08.200
I have an appointment.

146
00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:09.210
Another online date?

147
00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:12.260
Wrong, I met her on a dating app,

148
00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:13.300
I'm modernizing.

149
00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:16.860
Court your online hussies somewhere else.

150
00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:17.693
Liquor's free here.

151
00:07:17.693 --> 00:07:18.760
No, it's not -

152
00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:20.160
Nick, it's 9:00 a.m.

153
00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.340
That's true, it is 9:00 a.m., Conroy.

154
00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:24.903
She better show up sooner or
I'm gonna start without her.


155
00:07:25.738 --> 00:07:27.260
(door squeaks)

156
00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:28.243
[Darcy] Knock, knock.

157
00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:31.010
[Nick] Your breakfast, sir.

158
00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:31.873
Hello?

159
00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:34.140
Shit, she came in the front.

160
00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:35.490
Hey, the tournament -

161
00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:37.130
get this place in shape, huh?

162
00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:38.654
I need you to go out there
and talk to the exterminator.


163
00:07:38.654 --> 00:07:40.072
Is that a...

164
00:07:40.072 --> 00:07:41.373
That's where I cut you off.

165
00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:45.130
Ah, miss Darcy.

166
00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:46.113
Charlie Conroy!

167
00:07:54.169 --> 00:07:56.942
You're the exterminator?

168
00:07:56.942 --> 00:07:57.775
...Yeah.

169
00:07:57.775 --> 00:07:59.290
Yeah! What's your name?

170
00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:00.589
Jake.

171
00:08:00.589 --> 00:08:01.850
Hey Jake, I'm Nick.

172
00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:03.280
Nice to meet you.

173
00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:04.750
Jake, do you ever get
in the mind of a bug

174
00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:05.850
when you do your work?

175
00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:09.970
Nah, I usually just kill 'em.

176
00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:10.803
Right.

177
00:08:10.803 --> 00:08:12.300
So what's the damage?

178
00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:14.803
Well, it's roaches which I'm sure you saw.

179
00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:17.730
Some cultures in the
Amazon believe roaches


180
00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:20.133
are premonition of death to the homeowner.

181
00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:23.550
Who do you think's gonna die, Jake?

182
00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:27.290
I mean, I don't really know you guys.

183
00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:28.690
Yeah.

184
00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:31.610
Yeah, I mean, I'll send
the bill soon as possible.


185
00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:32.490
Just in case.

186
00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:34.170
How about club credit?

187
00:08:34.170 --> 00:08:35.003
...Beverages included, of course.

188
00:08:35.003 --> 00:08:35.836
No, no, that's not possible.

189
00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:39.730
All right, well send the bill over,

190
00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:41.370
we'll take care of it, quick.

191
00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:43.330
Yeah, we take any major credit card.

192
00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:45.550
We're just a regular company.

193
00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:48.780
Man, we really like that club
credit thing around here,


194
00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:50.290
but yeah, it's whatever, okay,

195
00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:51.340
what do you gotta do?

196
00:08:55.996 --> 00:08:57.350
All right, how about this?

197
00:08:57.350 --> 00:09:00.960
I'll give you a small
discount for a bucket of balls


198
00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:02.370
at the driving range.

199
00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:03.280
You got a deal.

200
00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:05.530
But no one can find out about this.

201
00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:07.253
Nobody.

202
00:09:07.253 --> 00:09:10.690
If my girl finds out, she will
literally cut my dick off.


203
00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:13.950
Sir, I know secrets men have died for.

204
00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:15.943
Good men, men of honor.

205
00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:19.990
Yeah, whatever, man.

206
00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:21.520
Just don't tell anybody.

207
00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:22.750
I mean, I don't know my name.

208
00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:23.603
I won't tell me.

209
00:09:26.393 --> 00:09:27.793
...You just said it was Nick.

210
00:10:03.033 --> 00:10:06.340
[Nick opens beer]

211
00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:07.840
So she says, come to the hotel

212
00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:09.773
and text me when you get there.

213
00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:12.340
I do.

214
00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:15.640
She says there's this card
key underneath the mat,


215
00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:19.150
the side door, and there was.

216
00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:19.983
Opened the door...

217
00:10:19.983 --> 00:10:22.950
Didn't really know what to
expect, but I saw it right away.


218
00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:25.470
The bathroom would be right
there, but there was a,


219
00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:28.020
like a sheet completely
covering the bathroom door.


220
00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:29.810
But there was a slit in the sheet.

221
00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:32.030
What are you talking about?

222
00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:34.380
[Dogleg] Yes, sir, I'd like
to make a return please.


223
00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:38.460
On an item number A2415.

224
00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:41.040
It's lube on the move.

225
00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:42.230
Yes, sir, I have two of those

226
00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:44.103
and I'd like return them both, please.

227
00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:46.793
There's Dogleg.

228
00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:52.203
Hey also, is this approved by FDA?

229
00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:54.020
No?

230
00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:55.137
So you still don't know
what she looks like?


231
00:10:55.137 --> 00:10:55.970
Not a clue.

232
00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:57.840
[Jake] You guys gotta
keep hanging out, or?


233
00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:59.069
- I hope so, man.

234
00:10:59.069 --> 00:10:59.950
[Jake] Think it'll be something serious?

235
00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:01.623
I doubt it could possibly be.

236
00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:04.785
By the way, it's...

237
00:11:04.785 --> 00:11:05.868
Damn!

238
00:11:05.868 --> 00:11:06.701
Fuck you man.

239
00:11:06.701 --> 00:11:08.180
[Jake] Yeah man, thanks
for letting me do this.


240
00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:10.430
Oh, it's my pleasure.

241
00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:12.540
Thanks for listening to my story.

242
00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:13.490
Mom didn't like it.

243
00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:19.660
Holy shit.

244
00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:20.940
Man, you're pretty good.

245
00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:23.860
I'm gonna come up there
and kick your ass, dude!


246
00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:25.460
Yeah, I used to play.

247
00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:26.700
Used to?

248
00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:28.930
Yeah, girlfriend.

249
00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:30.493
Ah, right.

250
00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:34.530
No, the blow-up-doll was fine.

251
00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:36.980
We just wish it was
a girl not a guy.

252
00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:38.750
But it's fine, my wife loves him-

253
00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:40.490
You must have a huge dick!

254
00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:43.690
- Oh, not you sir.

255
00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:44.970
Do we like this guy?

256
00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:46.391
I don't even know that guy.

257
00:11:46.391 --> 00:11:49.127
[Dogleg] I've gotta...

258
00:11:49.127 --> 00:11:51.730
What's the flattest iron
you're having there?


259
00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:53.087
We got a two!

260
00:11:53.087 --> 00:11:53.980
You have a two iron?
[Nick] Oh yeah.


261
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:55.440
For real?

262
00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:56.797
Wow, look at that.

263
00:11:56.797 --> 00:11:57.630
Get it.

264
00:11:57.630 --> 00:11:58.463
That'll work.

265
00:11:58.463 --> 00:12:00.580
Oh man, I can't
wait to see this shit.

266
00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:01.720
What is this, a family heirloom?

267
00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:03.270
Nah, I don't have any family.

268
00:12:11.196 --> 00:12:14.279
(golf ball whistles)

269
00:12:15.461 --> 00:12:16.493
Goddamn dude.

270
00:12:18.650 --> 00:12:19.483
Holy shit.

271
00:12:19.483 --> 00:12:20.316
[Nick] Wow.

272
00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:23.610
I will be right back, sir.

273
00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:24.443
All right.

274
00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:35.630
So, what are the rules on the participants

275
00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:37.260
for the tournament?

276
00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:40.450
Employees and members, even I know that.

277
00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:41.283
...This guy.

278
00:12:41.283 --> 00:12:43.400
You know, we're still looking
for a club for pro, right?


279
00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:45.290
Pro, what happened to Harvey?

280
00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:46.477
Oh, he's dead.

281
00:12:46.477 --> 00:12:47.670
What?

282
00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:49.219
How, when?

283
00:12:49.219 --> 00:12:51.073
A couple years, 
I have no idea really?

284
00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:53.093
My word.

285
00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:56.996
[Dougleg] Fuck you man.

286
00:12:56.996 --> 00:12:58.282
Damn you.

287
00:12:58.282 --> 00:12:59.449
Ah, fuck dude.

288
00:13:00.851 --> 00:13:02.601
My balls everywhere!

289
00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:04.463
Oh man.

290
00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:06.310
What the heck dude.

291
00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:10.340
Fuck man.

292
00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:12.110
Fuck you, man.

293
00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:12.943
What?

294
00:13:12.943 --> 00:13:14.183
No, I'll call you back.

295
00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:16.350
Good?

296
00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:18.180
[Dogleg] Fuck you!

297
00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:19.130
I can't hear you.

298
00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:21.623
I'm Jake.

299
00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:23.713
Jake!

300
00:13:28.032 --> 00:13:31.115
(golf cart whirring)

301
00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:39.430
Hey, that was pretty
incredible on the range there.


302
00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:41.110
Oh, thanks man.

303
00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:43.780
I'm Charlie Conroy, 
I own all this.

304
00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:45.090
Oh, Jake Baxter.

305
00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:46.310
Nice to meet you.

306
00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:48.243
How much you make killing bugs, Jake?

307
00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:50.635
Not a ton.

308
00:13:50.635 --> 00:13:51.952
(phone rings)

309
00:13:51.952 --> 00:13:53.640
Oh, go ahead.

310
00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:54.473
What's up, Pop.

311
00:13:54.473 --> 00:13:57.470
Where in the hell have you been?

312
00:13:57.470 --> 00:14:00.770
Janice Wieman has called three times!

313
00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:01.947
I know, yes, I'm on it.

314
00:14:01.947 --> 00:14:02.950
[Pop] You've been outta-

315
00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:05.240
I'm on it Pop.

316
00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:06.073
[Pop] -fuckin around on the golf course -

317
00:14:06.073 --> 00:14:07.380
I'm hanging up.

318
00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:08.880
Goodbye.
[Pop} Piece of shit.


319
00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:09.713
Work for me.

320
00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:11.863
What's that?

321
00:14:11.863 --> 00:14:13.040
I want you to be my golf pro.

322
00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:15.640
You serious?

323
00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:18.000
You got quite a reputation, you know that?

324
00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.680
I remember you from your college days.

325
00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:23.350
Oh yeah, my college days.

326
00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:26.100
Criminal, dropout, golf phenom...

327
00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:27.300
You'll fit right in man.

328
00:14:28.530 --> 00:14:29.930
What do you guys even pay?

329
00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:31.703
Double.

330
00:14:31.703 --> 00:14:33.430
Of half your current pay,

331
00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:34.923
10% increase, of course.

332
00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:39.578
Yeah, that's a really shitty deal. Sorry.

333
00:14:39.578 --> 00:14:40.890
Shit's also a fertilizer, Jake,

334
00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:42.470
plus you're an exterminator, so...

335
00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:45.300
You get a raise
to have a cool job.

336
00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:47.810
Why don't you show up
tomorrow morning, 9:00 a.m.


337
00:14:47.810 --> 00:14:48.890
Anything else Nick?

338
00:14:48.890 --> 00:14:50.450
Well, I mean you get
free buckets of balls.


339
00:14:50.450 --> 00:14:51.310
The world's yours, buddy.

340
00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:53.380
Yeah, I can't, I'm sorry.

341
00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:56.190
That would be a huge
problem with my girlfriend.


342
00:14:56.190 --> 00:14:58.300
She should be happy if you're happy, Jake.

343
00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:00.510
And if not just dump her ass.

344
00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:04.530
I can't, she's rich and beautiful, so.

345
00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:06.950
I'm sure she's understanding.

346
00:15:06.950 --> 00:15:08.230
And rich and beautiful? No.

347
00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:10.730
How does she feel about
your current employment?


348
00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:15.580
It's literally anything
but golf is allowed.


349
00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:16.413
Really?

350
00:15:16.413 --> 00:15:17.720
That's kind of where I right now.

351
00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:19.080
(phone rings) Jesus.

352
00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:20.460
I'm sorry.

353
00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:22.580
Yes Pop, I'm just finishing up over here.

354
00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:26.073
It's okay Jake, you're fired.

355
00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:30.743
Hello?

356
00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:35.283
I just got fired.

357
00:15:44.223 --> 00:15:46.693
(pat on back)

358
00:15:46.693 --> 00:15:47.900
See you tomorrow morning.

359
00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:48.733
9:00 a.m.

360
00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:53.873
Oh, goddamn it.

361
00:16:38.190 --> 00:16:39.123
[Jarvis] Well gentlemen,

362
00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:42.840
welcome to the quarterly board meeting

363
00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:45.460
of the Magnolia Pointe Country Club.

364
00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:48.350
Our first order of business today

365
00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:53.350
is to revoke the membership
of Mr. Gerald Schilner.


366
00:16:53.381 --> 00:16:57.320
It seems his financials

367
00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:01.100
are not in line with
this club's requirements.


368
00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:03.560
And his car's five years
old for heaven sakes.


369
00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:04.923
[Gary] And it's hunter green.

370
00:17:06.090 --> 00:17:08.327
Poor people, ew. (they all laugh)

371
00:17:08.327 --> 00:17:09.813
[Adrian] Zip it, you twats!

372
00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:13.133
Daddy.

373
00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.290
Anything else?

374
00:17:15.290 --> 00:17:17.370
Yeah, I just talked to Darcy Dobbins.

375
00:17:17.370 --> 00:17:20.453
It seems Twin Pines has
hired a new golf pro.


376
00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:22.573
Did they?

377
00:17:22.573 --> 00:17:23.600
[Thomas] Yes, sir, Mr. Boyd.

378
00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:27.533
An exterminator... Jake Baxter.

379
00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:30.367
JAKE BAXTER!?

380
00:17:30.367 --> 00:17:32.579
(man laughs)

381
00:17:32.579 --> 00:17:33.860
Yeah, we are familiar.

382
00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:35.870
He was on my golf team in college.

383
00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:38.050
He got kicked out for selling drugs.

384
00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:39.173
Is he any good?

385
00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:42.010
He beat Adrian a few times.

386
00:17:42.010 --> 00:17:43.500
I was injured.

387
00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:44.933
Okay, then what?

388
00:17:44.933 --> 00:17:47.820
Then he became a loser
exterminator, genius.


389
00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:48.850
Duh.

390
00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:49.953
Not anymore.

391
00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:53.886
Clean your ugly face, ugly person.

392
00:17:53.886 --> 00:17:55.230
Oh burn.

393
00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:56.930
(both laugh)

394
00:17:56.930 --> 00:17:59.050
Fuck you Thomas.
- Fuck you.


395
00:17:59.050 --> 00:18:03.423
So what exactly do we need to
know about this Baxter guy?


396
00:18:07.774 --> 00:18:10.474
I said, what do we need to
know about this Baxter guy?


397
00:18:16.117 --> 00:18:19.200
(car engine roaring)

398
00:18:20.039 --> 00:18:22.789
(rain pattering)

399
00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:41.613
Brandy?

400
00:18:43.356 --> 00:18:44.310
The fuck!

401
00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:45.630
Where have you been?

402
00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:47.910
Fuck it, I was working late.

403
00:18:47.910 --> 00:18:49.420
There's a bunch of bugs-

404
00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:51.070
I'll ask you again.

405
00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:53.560
Where the fuck have you been?

406
00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:54.393
I cooked.

407
00:18:54.393 --> 00:18:55.670
I cheated on you.

408
00:18:55.670 --> 00:18:58.230
I was out having sex with
someone, my secretary.


409
00:18:58.230 --> 00:18:59.460
You don't have a secretary.

410
00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:01.630
A secretary, and she was so hot, too.

411
00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:04.780
And she was a doctor secretary,
and she was a doctor, too.


412
00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:05.613
Son of a bitch.

413
00:19:05.613 --> 00:19:07.010
It was just sticking outta
my pocket, wasn't it?


414
00:19:07.010 --> 00:19:07.930
Classic Baxter.

415
00:19:07.930 --> 00:19:10.130
Pop fired you and now you're playing golf.

416
00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:11.770
Babe, it was just the driving range.

417
00:19:11.770 --> 00:19:12.968
It wasn't even fun.

418
00:19:12.968 --> 00:19:14.654
It was stupid-
Same thing.


419
00:19:14.654 --> 00:19:15.487
Well, it's not the same thing, baby.

420
00:19:15.487 --> 00:19:16.670
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

421
00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:19.220
But I have news, 
I have really good news.

422
00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:20.290
You ready?

423
00:19:20.290 --> 00:19:21.350
So you know how you've always been saying

424
00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:24.303
I should quit Roach
Smokers, get a real job.


425
00:19:24.303 --> 00:19:26.570
Yeah, but you didn't quit, you got fired.

426
00:19:26.570 --> 00:19:28.790
Yeah, that part took care of itself.

427
00:19:28.790 --> 00:19:31.830
But the cool part is
I got a new job.

428
00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:34.070
Who would hire you?

429
00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:35.103
Twin Pines.

430
00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.800
Conroy's old club?

431
00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:39.633
Yeah.

432
00:19:39.633 --> 00:19:42.853
And what are you doing at Twin Pines?

433
00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:45.386
I don't know.

434
00:19:45.386 --> 00:19:46.360
We- we didn't really talk about it.

435
00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:47.193
I think I'm the new club pro.

436
00:19:47.193 --> 00:19:48.026
That's it.

437
00:19:49.330 --> 00:19:52.040
Babe, it pays more and it's
something I actually enjoy.


438
00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:53.210
Like we need money.

439
00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:54.970
I'm not gonna keep living
off your dad's money


440
00:19:54.970 --> 00:19:55.930
for the rest of my life.

441
00:19:55.930 --> 00:19:57.390
What the fuck is that?

442
00:19:57.390 --> 00:19:58.230
Is that new?

443
00:19:58.230 --> 00:20:00.091
There's a new man in town.

444
00:20:00.091 --> 00:20:01.250
Good God.

445
00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:06.250
So you just need to
get out of my house.

446
00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:08.450
Brandy.
Now.


447
00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:09.820
Fuck!.
Like now.


448
00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:10.653
Are you seriously hitting me?

449
00:20:10.653 --> 00:20:12.228
Like for real.
Okay, Brandy!


450
00:20:12.228 --> 00:20:13.271
Like, get out.

451
00:20:13.271 --> 00:20:15.056
- If I did that to you-
Now, get out.


452
00:20:15.056 --> 00:20:15.889
- It'd be a
whole thing on the news.

453
00:20:18.127 --> 00:20:18.960
(banging on door)

454
00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:19.793
Brandy!

455
00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:23.790
Please don't use that thing without me

456
00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:28.575
that will ruin my
confidence, Brandy, please.


457
00:20:28.575 --> 00:20:30.660
(thunder rumbling)

458
00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:32.083
Can I at least have my keys?

459
00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:34.533
Brandy.

460
00:20:36.379 --> 00:20:39.379
(crickets chirping)

461
00:21:17.428 --> 00:21:19.845
(door bangs)

462
00:21:21.690 --> 00:21:22.523
Excuse me.

463
00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:24.550
Sorry.

464
00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:25.553
(Eñejo whispers) Shut the fuck up man!

465
00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:28.903
We're trying to surprise someone.

466
00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:31.561
(Jake whispers) Who are we surprising?

467
00:21:31.561 --> 00:21:32.500
You're still talking?

468
00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:34.053
I'm sorry, man.

469
00:21:34.053 --> 00:21:36.240
Dude, we got a new golf pro.

470
00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:37.073
Just go and spray
or whatever you do, bro.

471
00:21:37.073 --> 00:21:37.906
...You're gonna laugh, but I
think I'm the new golf pro.


472
00:21:49.647 --> 00:21:51.388
Unless you hired more than one.

473
00:21:51.388 --> 00:21:52.221
What?

474
00:21:52.221 --> 00:21:53.054
I'm Jake.

475
00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:57.050
I met Conroy yesterday, and Nick.

476
00:21:57.050 --> 00:21:59.320
(yells out) Fucking surprise bro.

477
00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:03.350
Hey Jake! Someone unjammed
the back door, that's awesome.


478
00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:04.183
Whoa.

479
00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:06.470
We love surprises around here.

480
00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:07.303
We just love 'em.

481
00:22:07.303 --> 00:22:08.136
We're not good at 'em but-

482
00:22:08.136 --> 00:22:09.810
No, no, I was surprised.

483
00:22:09.810 --> 00:22:12.000
Yeah, hey, grab some candy if you want.

484
00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:12.833
I'm good for now.

485
00:22:12.833 --> 00:22:13.730
Okay, okay.

486
00:22:13.730 --> 00:22:15.520
Yeah, we already got into that piñata.

487
00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:16.840
I mean it's a piñata, yeah.

488
00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:19.830
Hey, this is the Twin Pines crew.

489
00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:20.770
How's it going everybody?

490
00:22:20.770 --> 00:22:23.257
Yeah, look at that.
Thank you for this.


491
00:22:23.257 --> 00:22:25.150
Jake... uh, Baxter.

492
00:22:25.150 --> 00:22:26.753
Yeah, our head greensman, Eñejo.

493
00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:29.710
Hey, aloha amigo.

494
00:22:29.710 --> 00:22:30.543
Aloha.

495
00:22:30.543 --> 00:22:34.010
Hey, pacha-mama of the
Aztec nation welcomes you.


496
00:22:34.010 --> 00:22:36.720
Yeah, pacha-mama uh back at you.

497
00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:38.253
Tell her, I said hello.

498
00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:41.930
Goes to Peru one week,
changes him forever.


499
00:22:41.930 --> 00:22:42.920
That's where we met actually.

500
00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:44.203
Follow me.

501
00:22:44.203 --> 00:22:46.040
This is Fred, she's our badass bartender.

502
00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:47.560
Fred, is it?
Fred.


503
00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:48.783
As in like...

504
00:22:48.783 --> 00:22:50.035
Fred.

505
00:22:50.035 --> 00:22:51.360
Your name is Fred.

506
00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:52.980
We got Shainski, Mikels.

507
00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:54.490
I would avoid them if you could.

508
00:22:54.490 --> 00:22:56.580
You're late to the party, bro.

509
00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:59.433
That's okay, Jake's running late too.

510
00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:02.240
Are they good?

511
00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:03.640
No, they're not.

512
00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:05.010
All right, here we have Emily.

513
00:23:05.010 --> 00:23:06.940
She drives the beer cart.

514
00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:08.300
And her sister as hot as hell

515
00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:09.810
and doesn't think that I am.

516
00:23:09.810 --> 00:23:11.050
Bummer.
Yeah.


517
00:23:11.050 --> 00:23:12.320
Hi Jake.
How's it going?


518
00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:14.740
Your expertise is a welcome change.

519
00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:17.690
Hopefully you work out better
than the last head pro.


520
00:23:17.690 --> 00:23:18.780
He died.

521
00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:19.970
Yeah.

522
00:23:19.970 --> 00:23:20.810
Did he really die?

523
00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:22.260
Oh yeah, he died real hard.

524
00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:23.100
[Jake] Oh.

525
00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:25.873
Last and very least, we have Dogleg.

526
00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:28.540
He drives the picker cart,
which you demolished,


527
00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:30.200
but he also runs the pro shop

528
00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:31.380
and you could use some new threads.

529
00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:32.680
So go ahead and do your thing Leg.

530
00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:35.740
I say a medium
shirt, 32 by 30 pants.

531
00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:38.110
A little loose on the trousers there.

532
00:23:38.110 --> 00:23:39.350
Yeah, actually dead on.

533
00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:42.310
You hit my cart again,
I'll rip those nuts off.


534
00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:43.143
Cool.

535
00:23:43.143 --> 00:23:45.370
Sorry, I didn't know I would
like meet you in person.


536
00:23:45.370 --> 00:23:47.150
Okay, beer.

537
00:23:47.150 --> 00:23:48.740
I'm good, thank you.

538
00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:49.573
Little early, don't you think?

539
00:23:49.573 --> 00:23:51.360
It's like 9:00 a.m.
Okay.


540
00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:53.450
Thank you, thank you for saying that.

541
00:23:53.450 --> 00:23:55.421
I think we started around 7:00, right?

542
00:23:55.421 --> 00:23:56.545
6:00?

543
00:23:56.545 --> 00:23:57.517
Maybe 6:30.

544
00:23:57.517 --> 00:23:58.350
El YESTARDA

545
00:23:58.350 --> 00:23:59.500
Enejo hasn't stopped.

546
00:24:00.833 --> 00:24:01.666
Really?

547
00:24:01.666 --> 00:24:02.620
Yeah.

548
00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:06.460
So you guys all just drink
as soon as the day starts.


549
00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:07.423
Welcome to hell.

550
00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:10.650
Right on, cool.

551
00:24:10.650 --> 00:24:13.053
So who's all like running things?

552
00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:18.710
Back to work, everyone!

553
00:24:23.230 --> 00:24:24.063
Gotcha!

554
00:24:25.028 --> 00:24:26.280
We so got him.

555
00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:27.890
Yeah, this place pretty much runs itself.

556
00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:29.130
We're fine.

557
00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:30.189
It does?

558
00:24:30.189 --> 00:24:31.430
Yeah.

559
00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:32.330
I don't know.

560
00:24:32.330 --> 00:24:33.460
I do...

561
00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:34.293
...and you do too.

562
00:24:34.293 --> 00:24:37.170
Hey, let me show you your office.

563
00:24:37.170 --> 00:24:38.003
I have an office.

564
00:24:38.003 --> 00:24:39.840
Fuck yeah, you have an office.

565
00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:40.673
Oh yeah, sure.

566
00:24:40.673 --> 00:24:41.506
Show me the office.

567
00:24:41.506 --> 00:24:42.339
Follow me.
All right.


568
00:24:42.339 --> 00:24:43.720
Excuse me.
Sorry.


569
00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:44.620
Yep, here we go.

570
00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:46.973
Oh, is this it?

571
00:24:46.973 --> 00:24:48.340
Yeah.
Oh, okay.


572
00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:49.173
Yeah.

573
00:24:49.173 --> 00:24:50.006
I thought you said, 
I got an office.

574
00:24:50.006 --> 00:24:51.130
I don't think I said that.

575
00:24:51.130 --> 00:24:53.120
Now get back there, feel it out.

576
00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:53.953
Sure.

577
00:24:53.953 --> 00:24:55.520
No, yeah, this is nice.

578
00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:56.690
Yeah, it is.

579
00:24:56.690 --> 00:24:59.240
Yeah, this is...
[Nick] A desk.


580
00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:00.350
Yeah, this is plenty.

581
00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:02.290
Agreed, agreed.

582
00:25:02.290 --> 00:25:03.540
Oops.

583
00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:04.390
It's all right.

584
00:25:05.490 --> 00:25:06.323
Oh my God.

585
00:25:06.323 --> 00:25:07.156
That.

586
00:25:08.170 --> 00:25:09.500
Can't waste that.

587
00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:10.333
Yeah.

588
00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:15.620
So just to be clear, what
exactly is my job supposed to be?


589
00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:17.870
You know, go out to
the range and practice,


590
00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:21.600
participate in our annual tournament.

591
00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:23.440
Glad-hand the members and the guests.

592
00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:24.419
Club pro shit.

593
00:25:24.419 --> 00:25:25.490
Wait, I have to play in a tournament?

594
00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:27.180
Yeah, it's not a
big deal, it'll be fun.

595
00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:28.410
There's no pressure, we never win.

596
00:25:28.410 --> 00:25:30.590
Okay, I haven't played
golf in like seven years.


597
00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:32.353
Well, I appreciate your modesty.

598
00:25:33.235 --> 00:25:34.513
What is that?

599
00:25:34.513 --> 00:25:35.346
What?

600
00:25:35.346 --> 00:25:36.179
Is that a hickey?

601
00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:38.690
It's definitely not a hickey.

602
00:25:38.690 --> 00:25:40.850
I haven't had a hickey
in a really long time.


603
00:25:40.850 --> 00:25:42.240
You dog, let's get you
outta those clothes.


604
00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:44.400
Is there something on my neck, Nick?

605
00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:46.152
Nick, my neck?

606
00:25:46.152 --> 00:25:48.735
(upbeat music)

607
00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:00.933
All right, so this is
where you'll be schmoozing


608
00:26:00.933 --> 00:26:03.520
with the guests, the
members, the drunk golfers,


609
00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:06.267
giving 'em tips and tricks
and stuff like that.


610
00:26:06.267 --> 00:26:07.470
Let's do a shot.

611
00:26:07.470 --> 00:26:09.047
I'm good, thank you.

612
00:26:09.047 --> 00:26:10.047
All right.

613
00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:16.030
You are spilling that.

614
00:26:16.030 --> 00:26:17.780
All over the bar, sure.

615
00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:18.680
Great.

616
00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:20.300
All right, there you go.

617
00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:22.080
I said no, thank you.

618
00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:22.930
I'll take both.

619
00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:26.320
Jake, I'm sure no one's told you.

620
00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:28.130
So let me be the first.

621
00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:30.450
We're not gonna make it to next quarter.

622
00:26:30.450 --> 00:26:33.740
Fred, easy, it's his first day.

623
00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:34.910
Welcome Jake.

624
00:26:34.910 --> 00:26:36.400
Where's your glass?

625
00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:37.650
I actually don't drink.

626
00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:39.933
What?

627
00:26:41.519 --> 00:26:43.270
If I have one
drink, then within the hour,

628
00:26:43.270 --> 00:26:45.840
I'll be out on that
fairway naked smoking meth.


629
00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:48.190
It's like a whole problem,
people will hate me.


630
00:26:49.090 --> 00:26:50.330
People would love you.

631
00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:51.830
Whoa, whoa, whoa, do not try to corrupt

632
00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:52.800
our new golf pro.

633
00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:53.640
The hell is wrong with you two.

634
00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:55.700
Fred is right.

635
00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:58.170
It's actually kind of perfect.

636
00:26:58.170 --> 00:26:59.730
Not only do we need
to fix this place up,

637
00:26:59.730 --> 00:27:01.810
but we need to win that prize money.

638
00:27:01.810 --> 00:27:05.160
And if Jake is sober, God help him,

639
00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:06.960
maybe that will improve our chances.

640
00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:09.900
I'm glad you think that's funny.

641
00:27:10.970 --> 00:27:14.180
Now who besides the three of
us here can actually play golf?


642
00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:16.670
Well, we got me.
One.


643
00:27:16.670 --> 00:27:17.790
You.
Two.


644
00:27:17.790 --> 00:27:19.680
There's this guy.
Now three.


645
00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:21.470
Yeah, you're right.

646
00:27:21.470 --> 00:27:22.740
We need one more.

647
00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:24.770
Conroy, we have to win
the tournament this year.


648
00:27:24.770 --> 00:27:26.740
Have we ever won the tournament?

649
00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:27.573
Yeah.

650
00:27:28.570 --> 00:27:29.743
A long time ago.

651
00:27:30.610 --> 00:27:33.120
My dad started the Dixie
when he built this club,


652
00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:34.880
I can't get us kicked out of it.

653
00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:37.580
Besides we need that fucking prize money.

654
00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:39.070
We can do countless things.

655
00:27:39.070 --> 00:27:42.440
We could do like a
yard sale of some sort.

656
00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:45.140
We could do a car,
like a sexy car wash.

657
00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:45.973
Something, I don't know.

658
00:27:45.973 --> 00:27:47.030
We could strip down and get some--

659
00:27:47.030 --> 00:27:47.934
- I'm not doing a car wash.

660
00:27:47.934 --> 00:27:49.570
I don't know, I'm just riffing.

661
00:27:49.570 --> 00:27:52.060
We lose the tournament, we lose the money,

662
00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:54.500
we lose the club, we lose our jobs.

663
00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:56.150
I'm losing my buzz.

664
00:27:56.150 --> 00:27:56.983
Anyone wanna shot?

665
00:27:56.983 --> 00:27:58.000
Deal me in.
Jake?


666
00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:59.290
No, I'm still sober.

667
00:27:59.290 --> 00:28:03.200
So Conroy, do I have to play
against other like, club pros?


668
00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:04.950
Relax, it's captain's choice.

669
00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:06.330
Best ball wins each stroke.

670
00:28:06.330 --> 00:28:07.467
No, no, that's the whole thing.

671
00:28:07.467 --> 00:28:09.670
That's what I was telling you, I can't.

672
00:28:09.670 --> 00:28:10.980
My girlfriend.

673
00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:13.220
Look, who is this girl?

674
00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:14.393
Why does she hate golf?

675
00:28:15.610 --> 00:28:19.700
Jake, many psychologists
affirm that malicious feelings


676
00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:21.770
toward a significant others' key interest

677
00:28:21.770 --> 00:28:22.603
is very, very toxic.

678
00:28:22.603 --> 00:28:23.436
Psychologists don't
even know my girlfriend.


679
00:28:25.570 --> 00:28:28.710
We're fine, we're in love.

680
00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:31.453
I like her a lot and we're happy.

681
00:28:34.610 --> 00:28:35.960
When I was in
college, on the golf team,

682
00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:37.180
I used to get
in a lot of trouble

683
00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:40.559
and her whole family kinda hates me.

684
00:28:40.559 --> 00:28:41.392
Yeah.

685
00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:44.820
So shots?

686
00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:46.010
No, I don't drink.

687
00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:47.020
I permanently don't drink.

688
00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:49.060
Okay.
At all.


689
00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:49.893
All right.

690
00:28:51.570 --> 00:28:52.403
I get it.

691
00:28:54.126 --> 00:28:57.209
(classical music)

692
00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:00.920
Well, it's just been a
pleasure to meet you,


693
00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:01.900
Mr. Al
-Asmari

694
00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:03.620
Sarah, the pleasure's all mine.

695
00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:05.470
Thank you so much.

696
00:29:05.470 --> 00:29:07.570
Your application has been submitted,

697
00:29:07.570 --> 00:29:09.640
so I hope I get to call
you in a couple of weeks


698
00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:10.530
with the good news.

699
00:29:10.530 --> 00:29:11.640
Well, I'm excited, Sarah.

700
00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:13.970
I've been looking forward to
playing this place a long time.


701
00:29:13.970 --> 00:29:15.660
Oh, it's the my pleasure.

702
00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:17.090
Yes, you have a great day.

703
00:29:17.090 --> 00:29:18.200
I'll see you soon.
Yeah, you too.


704
00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:19.033
Okay.

705
00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:54.310
Relax, Sarah.

706
00:29:54.310 --> 00:29:55.250
Oh, I was--

707
00:29:55.250 --> 00:29:56.940
No, I thought I would just drop by

708
00:29:56.940 --> 00:29:59.310
and see how you were doing.

709
00:29:59.310 --> 00:30:01.506
I am doing fine.

710
00:30:01.506 --> 00:30:05.603
You know that applicant
that was just in here


711
00:30:05.603 --> 00:30:08.200
a little while ago.
Yes.


712
00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:11.200
He seemed a little, what's the word?

713
00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:15.003
Unconventional,
non-traditional, different.


714
00:30:17.130 --> 00:30:17.963
Sure.

715
00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:23.590
All business aside, that
offer for that second drink


716
00:30:23.590 --> 00:30:24.450
still stands.

717
00:30:24.450 --> 00:30:26.200
Oh, yeah.

718
00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:30.790
Oh, you know, I am just really exhausted.

719
00:30:30.790 --> 00:30:32.643
The end of a long day, you know?

720
00:30:34.410 --> 00:30:35.530
But thank you.

721
00:30:35.530 --> 00:30:37.530
We'll take this up at a different time.

722
00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:44.440
All right everybody, listen up.

723
00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:46.040
I got an announcement to make.

724
00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:48.620
We've got the Dixie tournament coming up

725
00:30:48.620 --> 00:30:51.210
and short story shorter, we have to win.

726
00:30:51.210 --> 00:30:53.590
So we are getting our shit together, okay.

727
00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:56.160
The team is gonna be
Jake, Nick and myself,


728
00:30:56.160 --> 00:31:01.160
which means only one of you
needs to learn how to play golf.


729
00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:02.790
Who's the best here at Twin Pines?

730
00:31:02.790 --> 00:31:04.400
Yeah, who sucks the least?

731
00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:05.900
That'd be Shane when he's sober,

732
00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:08.240
but one sip of booze, he's fucked.

733
00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:09.503
Harsh dude.

734
00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:11.493
It's true.

735
00:31:12.610 --> 00:31:15.100
Jake, all I know is that
you gotta beat that douche


736
00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:16.400
at Magnolia Pointe.

737
00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:17.440
Yeah, I am aware.

738
00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:18.290
Thank you, Emily.

739
00:31:18.290 --> 00:31:20.970
Yeah, Adrian Boyd has
not lost in seven years.


740
00:31:20.970 --> 00:31:23.222
Still the biggest douchebag
in seven kingdoms.


741
00:31:23.222 --> 00:31:24.055
Am I?

742
00:31:24.055 --> 00:31:25.450
Is he?

743
00:31:25.450 --> 00:31:26.653
Oh Christ.

744
00:31:28.450 --> 00:31:30.880
Jake fucking Baxter.

745
00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:33.800
I haven't seen you since
you were being a loser,


746
00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:35.970
letting everyone down.

747
00:31:35.970 --> 00:31:38.534
Shouldn't you be somewhere
spraying cockroaches?


748
00:31:38.534 --> 00:31:41.630
(all laugh)

749
00:31:41.630 --> 00:31:43.070
You know this prick?

750
00:31:43.070 --> 00:31:44.880
Yeah, for sure.

751
00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:46.240
Believe it or not, this tiny little boy

752
00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:48.740
is my future brother-in-law, can't wait.

753
00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:52.329
Maybe you people haven't realized this,

754
00:31:52.329 --> 00:31:55.483
but your new golf pro
is a convicted felon,


755
00:31:56.660 --> 00:32:00.625
an alcoholic and a drug addict.

756
00:32:00.625 --> 00:32:02.157
Yeah.

757
00:32:02.157 --> 00:32:02.990
(all cheer) Yeah!

758
00:32:03.850 --> 00:32:04.930
Don't cheer, don't cheer.

759
00:32:04.930 --> 00:32:06.023
I'm sober now, seven years.

760
00:32:06.023 --> 00:32:07.923
I keep telling you guys.
Thank you.


761
00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:11.500
Baxter, you deserve to be in this dump.

762
00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:12.830
Jesus!

763
00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:13.930
What color is your ceiling?

764
00:32:13.930 --> 00:32:14.803
Cancer?

765
00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:18.840
What's with this homeless guy?

766
00:32:24.016 --> 00:32:25.210
(both laugh)

767
00:32:25.210 --> 00:32:26.690
Fuck you.

768
00:32:26.690 --> 00:32:28.000
The fuck do you want?

769
00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:29.820
Just trying to grab some beers, man.

770
00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:31.640
Catch the scenery.

771
00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:34.720
Trying to figure out what
happened to this shithole.


772
00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:37.980
Hey sweetie, how about three beers, stat.

773
00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:39.721
Wow.
How about no.


774
00:32:39.721 --> 00:32:42.560
All right, I'm sorry, but her name's Fred.

775
00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:44.330
Fred?
Yeah.


776
00:32:44.330 --> 00:32:46.650
Oh, I'll call your name out later, baby.

777
00:32:46.650 --> 00:32:48.000
Fred, Fred.

778
00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.450
It's a guy's name.

779
00:32:49.450 --> 00:32:50.283
Oh Jesus.

780
00:32:51.370 --> 00:32:53.670
Hey, watch it bro, 
I'll sue your ass.

781
00:32:53.670 --> 00:32:54.960
Hold me back, man.

782
00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:57.570
Hey man, you're lucky
they're holding me back, bro.


783
00:32:57.570 --> 00:32:59.550
Slow down fucker.

784
00:32:59.550 --> 00:33:00.920
Shitty bar anyway.

785
00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:02.470
I think it's time for you to go.

786
00:33:02.470 --> 00:33:05.020
This place makes my eyes
want to kill themselves.


787
00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:07.073
Let's go.

788
00:33:08.550 --> 00:33:09.383
Wait.

789
00:33:10.810 --> 00:33:12.260
Hey Jake.

790
00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:13.093
What?

791
00:33:13.093 --> 00:33:15.650
Don't you wanna know what
my handicap is these days?


792
00:33:16.890 --> 00:33:18.793
Your personality?
Impotence?


793
00:33:19.660 --> 00:33:20.513
Oh my God.

794
00:33:22.750 --> 00:33:24.193
You think you can beat me.

795
00:33:25.965 --> 00:33:28.291
(they laugh)

796
00:33:28.291 --> 00:33:29.124
Oh my God.

797
00:33:31.090 --> 00:33:32.960
That is so adorable.

798
00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:34.790
I just wanna pinch you.

799
00:33:34.790 --> 00:33:37.517
(both laugh)

800
00:33:37.517 --> 00:33:38.544
I do!

801
00:33:38.544 --> 00:33:40.145
You know what, I do.

802
00:33:40.145 --> 00:33:42.135
It wouldn't be anything new, would it?

803
00:33:42.135 --> 00:33:44.650
That was seven years ago, man.

804
00:33:44.650 --> 00:33:47.600
Conroy, is this little asshole
the only competition we have?


805
00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:50.980
I promise you Baxter, 
I am a huge asshole.

806
00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:52.320
Huge.

807
00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:53.230
Gaping.

808
00:33:53.230 --> 00:33:55.160
When he poots, it goes whoooo.

809
00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:56.063
Wind tunnel.

810
00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:01.870
Why are you bragging about that?

811
00:34:01.870 --> 00:34:03.090
Watch your shit, Baxter.

812
00:34:03.090 --> 00:34:04.300
Yeah, I'll watch my shit, bro.

813
00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:06.760
I'll watch my shit drop on your face.

814
00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:08.552
Yeah gross, I'm sorry.

815
00:34:08.552 --> 00:34:11.120
I don't usually say stuff like that.

816
00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:12.170
I don't know what to say to that.

817
00:34:12.170 --> 00:34:13.003
Come on.

818
00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:16.330
Later nerds.

819
00:34:16.330 --> 00:34:18.610
Hey guys, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

820
00:34:18.610 --> 00:34:21.023
Wow, fuck.

821
00:34:22.052 --> 00:34:23.862
A bit of a scene, huh?

822
00:34:23.862 --> 00:34:25.917
I'm sorry about that everybody.

823
00:34:25.917 --> 00:34:27.160
I have kind of
a history with that guy.

824
00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:28.800
You just gotta externalize him, man.

825
00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:31.020
I mean this whole experience
is a result of our ego.


826
00:34:31.020 --> 00:34:35.340
So just absorb that negativity,
turn it into something good.


827
00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:37.550
After the tournament.
What was that dude?


828
00:34:37.550 --> 00:34:40.173
Was that like special
ops or Navy Seal or what?


829
00:34:40.173 --> 00:34:41.920
I was mall security for a while.

830
00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:42.753
Can I get a shot, please?

831
00:34:42.753 --> 00:34:43.586
[Dogleg] Dangerous mall.

832
00:34:43.586 --> 00:34:44.419
Yeah, you actually deserve this one.

833
00:34:45.926 --> 00:34:47.010
Hey, you know what,
can I borrow that club

834
00:34:47.010 --> 00:34:48.010
up there real quick?

835
00:34:49.170 --> 00:34:50.013
I got an idea.

836
00:34:50.930 --> 00:34:53.130
Go ahead.
Perfect.


837
00:34:53.130 --> 00:34:55.946
Can you come with me
though just 'cause you can,


838
00:34:55.946 --> 00:34:58.113
that kick that you can do.

839
00:35:05.630 --> 00:35:08.010
Those chicks upstairs were
jocking you so hard, bro.


840
00:35:08.010 --> 00:35:09.110
Of course they were.

841
00:35:12.254 --> 00:35:13.087
Get in the car.

842
00:35:17.860 --> 00:35:19.303
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

843
00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:22.930
There's no fucking way
I'm letting that guy


844
00:35:22.930 --> 00:35:23.920
steal my thunder.

845
00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:24.950
Oh hell no.

846
00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:27.140
Your thunder is so unstealable A. money.

847
00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:27.973
Right?

848
00:35:29.890 --> 00:35:30.723
[All] Yeah.

849
00:35:31.765 --> 00:35:32.598
Oh Jesus Christ.

850
00:35:32.598 --> 00:35:33.620
Are you okay?

851
00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:35.120
I don't know, you guys okay?

852
00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:37.333
Fore.

853
00:35:40.370 --> 00:35:41.870
Nobody fucks with Seabiscuit!

854
00:35:44.427 --> 00:35:46.308
Oh, he's coming, man.

855
00:35:46.308 --> 00:35:47.358
Get in the car man.

856
00:35:48.645 --> 00:35:50.762
Go, go, go, man.

857
00:35:50.762 --> 00:35:52.524
See you in court!

858
00:35:52.524 --> 00:35:53.524
Take care.

859
00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:03.833
Oh my God, man.

860
00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:07.140
This place rules, man.

861
00:36:08.530 --> 00:36:11.690
Jake, I cannot wait to see how
you perform in competition.


862
00:36:11.690 --> 00:36:12.540
Yeah, me too.

863
00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:13.610
See how it goes.

864
00:36:13.610 --> 00:36:15.110
So what happened in college?

865
00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:19.043
Yeah, yeah, that was kind of an ordeal.

866
00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:25.500
10 hookers from just
like the yellow pages.


867
00:36:25.530 --> 00:36:28.440
I think that was the worst
part, was the hookers.


868
00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:32.230
But then also a pound of
weed, half a gallon of jack.


869
00:36:32.230 --> 00:36:37.230
133 beers, I think they
counted, and ounce of coke.


870
00:36:37.780 --> 00:36:40.460
And then some molly and then
some guy brought ketamine.


871
00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:42.290
I had never done ketamine.

872
00:36:42.290 --> 00:36:46.610
So we did that and then poppers
and then half a tab of acid.


873
00:36:46.610 --> 00:36:48.670
This is after I won state junior year.

874
00:36:48.670 --> 00:36:50.650
That sounds like a great week.

875
00:36:50.650 --> 00:36:51.650
This was one night.

876
00:36:53.070 --> 00:36:54.830
How'd she find out?

877
00:36:54.830 --> 00:36:56.210
That was my fault.

878
00:36:56.210 --> 00:37:00.290
I invited her into bed
with us and then she knew


879
00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:02.940
right then and there.

880
00:37:02.940 --> 00:37:05.720
And how is she handling all this?

881
00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:07.290
Not great.

882
00:37:07.290 --> 00:37:08.950
She locked me out last night.

883
00:37:08.950 --> 00:37:10.100
I slept in the rain.

884
00:37:10.100 --> 00:37:12.860
So that's couple stuff.

885
00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:13.693
You're together seven years,

886
00:37:13.693 --> 00:37:16.730
you kinda, you sleep
in the rain sometimes.


887
00:37:16.730 --> 00:37:18.390
We'll talk about it at dinner.

888
00:37:18.390 --> 00:37:21.030
So back to this
whole you not playing golf

889
00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:22.750
for the last seven years.

890
00:37:22.750 --> 00:37:27.050
Can we get you back out for
another round or five tomorrow.


891
00:37:27.050 --> 00:37:29.690
And then every other day
leading up to the tournament?


892
00:37:29.690 --> 00:37:32.180
We've got two weeks to practice.

893
00:37:32.180 --> 00:37:34.720
Jake, historically, we've
not had the best relationship


894
00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:36.900
with the members at Magnolia Pointe.

895
00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:38.023
Or the management.

896
00:37:38.890 --> 00:37:40.403
Boss fucked Jarvis's wife.

897
00:37:42.170 --> 00:37:43.460
His ex-wife.

898
00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:44.690
Because you fucked her.

899
00:37:44.690 --> 00:37:46.720
You fucked Jarvis's wife?

900
00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:47.890
Oh my God, dude.

901
00:37:47.890 --> 00:37:49.390
Is that why they got divorced?

902
00:37:50.727 --> 00:37:52.400
You know the rumors
that he's in the closet


903
00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:53.970
and that's why they got divorced.

904
00:37:53.970 --> 00:37:56.040
Oh, he's deep in the closet.

905
00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:58.330
Damn dude, that's cool.

906
00:37:58.330 --> 00:38:00.390
I think that's really cool.

907
00:38:00.390 --> 00:38:01.630
Sick dude.

908
00:38:01.630 --> 00:38:03.580
How's Adrian's game looking these days?

909
00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:12.093
I said how's Adrian's game these days?

910
00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:05.391
Let me get this for you, sir.

911
00:39:05.391 --> 00:39:06.442
You got a little something on your shirt.

912
00:39:06.442 --> 00:39:07.315
What?

913
00:39:07.315 --> 00:39:08.148
Something on your shirt.

914
00:39:08.148 --> 00:39:08.981
- hat the hell?

915
00:39:08.981 --> 00:39:09.814
What is this?

916
00:39:09.814 --> 00:39:10.647
Did you do this?

917
00:39:10.647 --> 00:39:11.547
I did not.

918
00:39:11.547 --> 00:39:13.770
Get the hell out, you're fired.

919
00:39:13.770 --> 00:39:15.253
Oh right.
Get outta here.


920
00:39:27.870 --> 00:39:29.390
Night fellas.

921
00:39:29.390 --> 00:39:30.870
See you later, man.

922
00:39:30.870 --> 00:39:32.030
Good first day, Jake.

923
00:39:32.030 --> 00:39:33.350
Thank you, sir.

924
00:39:33.350 --> 00:39:34.183
You good to drive?

925
00:39:34.183 --> 00:39:35.420
Yeah, I got my license.

926
00:39:37.691 --> 00:39:40.774
(car engine revving)

927
00:39:54.616 --> 00:39:57.366
(car door thuds)

928
00:40:16.352 --> 00:40:17.185
Hey!

929
00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:21.133
Hey.

930
00:40:22.010 --> 00:40:23.170
You live there?

931
00:40:23.170 --> 00:40:24.003
Yeah.

932
00:40:27.870 --> 00:40:29.483
Why do you drive?

933
00:40:30.993 --> 00:40:33.503
Well, I was over
there, but I live here.

934
00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:38.013
Fair enough.

935
00:40:46.790 --> 00:40:47.623
Oof.

936
00:40:55.548 --> 00:40:57.965
(door thuds)

937
00:41:03.100 --> 00:41:05.010
Hey honey.

938
00:41:05.010 --> 00:41:06.503
Hey gummy bear.

939
00:41:08.050 --> 00:41:09.313
How was your first day?

940
00:41:10.756 --> 00:41:13.413
Ah, it was whatever.

941
00:41:14.410 --> 00:41:16.378
You know, it's one of those...

942
00:41:16.378 --> 00:41:17.211
Not great, huh?

943
00:41:17.211 --> 00:41:18.044
I guess you're just stuck with it.

944
00:41:21.330 --> 00:41:22.163
Yeah.

945
00:41:22.163 --> 00:41:24.130
Can't go back to Roach Smokers.

946
00:41:24.130 --> 00:41:26.970
I can't, it's so stupid, it sucks.

947
00:41:26.970 --> 00:41:29.280
I have to like golf now.

948
00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:30.113
Fuck.

949
00:41:30.113 --> 00:41:34.520
If you quit, you have sex again.

950
00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:35.753
Man, yes.

951
00:41:37.051 --> 00:41:39.093
Kind of starting to forget
what that feels like.


952
00:41:40.753 --> 00:41:42.900
Is that something we
could maybe discuss, or?


953
00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:44.223
I don't think so.

954
00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:46.573
Still no.

955
00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:48.623
That's fair.

956
00:41:50.790 --> 00:41:52.370
What's for dinner?

957
00:41:52.370 --> 00:41:57.370
We have a roasted bird with
brown rice and asparagus.


958
00:41:59.810 --> 00:42:00.643
Sounds good.

959
00:42:43.100 --> 00:42:43.933
Nope.

960
00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:49.153
Jesus Christ Brandy.

961
00:42:50.210 --> 00:42:51.530
You're torturing me at this point.

962
00:42:51.530 --> 00:42:53.778
You don't have to wear that to bed.

963
00:42:53.778 --> 00:42:58.778
It's just comfy.

964
00:43:07.148 --> 00:43:09.898
(Brandy moaning)

965
00:43:17.285 --> 00:43:18.452
Fucking God.

966
00:43:20.547 --> 00:43:21.987
Brandy, I need you.

967
00:43:21.987 --> 00:43:24.300
Then you need to find another job.

968
00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:26.670
Brandy, you can't keep blaming golf

969
00:43:26.670 --> 00:43:29.740
for all the things that
happened to us in college.


970
00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:31.410
I'm sorry us.

971
00:43:31.410 --> 00:43:33.450
And by that, do you mean
the hookers and drugs?


972
00:43:33.450 --> 00:43:34.550
That we did?

973
00:43:34.550 --> 00:43:36.520
Oh my God, here we go.

974
00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:40.200
If I can't blame golf
then who can I blame?


975
00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:42.900
Everything's been fine since
then and now look at you.


976
00:43:45.130 --> 00:43:48.553
No sex because golf.

977
00:43:53.023 --> 00:43:53.856
Fine.

978
00:43:55.947 --> 00:43:58.697
(Brandy moaning)

979
00:44:07.859 --> 00:44:08.692
Whatever.

980
00:44:08.692 --> 00:44:09.525
(porn music starts)

981
00:44:11.191 --> 00:44:13.524
(both moan)

982
00:44:17.955 --> 00:44:18.788
Oh yeah.

983
00:44:20.743 --> 00:44:21.576
Wow.

984
00:44:23.592 --> 00:44:25.131
Oh, yeah!

985
00:44:25.131 --> 00:44:27.411
Oh, this is better.

986
00:44:27.411 --> 00:44:29.870
I like this better!

987
00:44:29.870 --> 00:44:32.350
All right folks, balls teed up!

988
00:44:32.350 --> 00:44:33.723
Tee up those balls.

989
00:44:35.002 --> 00:44:37.835
(golf club bangs, misses)

990
00:44:40.430 --> 00:44:41.750
Fred, keep your head down.

991
00:44:41.750 --> 00:44:43.930
Dogleg, I would say probably just no,

992
00:44:43.930 --> 00:44:45.540
you can probably go pick up those balls.

993
00:44:45.540 --> 00:44:47.340
Gladys, I noticed a slice.

994
00:44:47.340 --> 00:44:49.250
Shainski, I know you
wanna have a wide stance


995
00:44:49.250 --> 00:44:51.350
'cause you're so drunk
and it's hard to stand up.


996
00:44:51.350 --> 00:44:52.340
But if you narrow that stance,

997
00:44:52.340 --> 00:44:54.960
you can get more rotation
through the hips, all right?


998
00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:57.080
Mikels bend those knees,
tighten up a little bit,


999
00:44:57.080 --> 00:44:58.090
but stay relaxed.

1000
00:44:58.090 --> 00:45:01.720
Eñejo, are those gardening gloves?

1001
00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:03.030
Emily, that was fucking hot.

1002
00:45:03.030 --> 00:45:05.001
That was good, the swing was good.

1003
00:45:05.001 --> 00:45:06.760
I've been working here for five years.

1004
00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:08.023
I don't know what they've been doing.

1005
00:45:08.023 --> 00:45:10.090
Okay everyone, if your
ball did not go past


1006
00:45:10.090 --> 00:45:12.720
the 100 yard marker, you
have officially been cut.


1007
00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:15.030
But don't get it twisted,
you have not been cut off.


1008
00:45:15.030 --> 00:45:16.380
Go ahead and feel free
to make your way back


1009
00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:18.780
to the clubhouse, put some
liquids into your face holes.


1010
00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:19.820
Have fun.

1011
00:45:19.820 --> 00:45:20.970
Yeah.

1012
00:45:20.970 --> 00:45:23.603
Hey you two, threesome?

1013
00:45:25.645 --> 00:45:26.478
Come on.

1014
00:45:26.478 --> 00:45:27.610
Hey, wait for me Gladys.

1015
00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:53.860
Oh shit snake, man.

1016
00:45:53.860 --> 00:45:55.513
Snake!

1017
00:45:55.513 --> 00:45:57.620
(Mikels laughs)

1018
00:45:57.620 --> 00:45:59.123
Meet Sir Hissyfit.

1019
00:46:00.730 --> 00:46:03.033
Oh, come on Shainski,
it was a joke, bro.

1020
00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:06.883
I got it all on video,
I'm posting right now.


1021
00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:09.903
[Gladys] You fucking pussy.

1022
00:46:12.062 --> 00:46:14.479
(man laughs)

1023
00:46:17.089 --> 00:46:19.589
(phone rings)

1024
00:46:20.865 --> 00:46:21.698
Hi.

1025
00:46:21.698 --> 00:46:22.531
Hey, what are you doing?

1026
00:46:22.531 --> 00:46:24.023
Just working away.

1027
00:46:24.910 --> 00:46:26.010
Looking at Match Strike?

1028
00:46:26.010 --> 00:46:26.870
Yeah, okay.

1029
00:46:26.870 --> 00:46:28.810
Fine, yeah, I am.

1030
00:46:28.810 --> 00:46:30.660
But unsuccessfully.

1031
00:46:30.660 --> 00:46:31.760
You'll find someone.

1032
00:46:32.953 --> 00:46:35.673
Hmm, sexy mama.

1033
00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:40.373
How about,

1034
00:46:41.500 --> 00:46:44.300
a drink?

1035
00:46:44.300 --> 00:46:47.080
(phone chimes)

1036
00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:50.400
Yeah, someone equally
as desperate as I am.


1037
00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:52.460
Charlie Conroy just messaged me.

1038
00:46:52.460 --> 00:46:54.690
That crazy guy that owns Twin Pines?

1039
00:46:54.690 --> 00:46:56.640
I haven't even said
one word to this guy

1040
00:46:56.640 --> 00:47:00.040
and he wants to meet for a drink.

1041
00:47:00.040 --> 00:47:01.530
He's desperate.

1042
00:47:01.530 --> 00:47:03.150
You're desperate too.

1043
00:47:03.150 --> 00:47:04.150
Talk to you later.

1044
00:47:06.510 --> 00:47:07.343
Hi.

1045
00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:10.827
How are you, Charlie?

1046
00:47:10.827 --> 00:47:13.290
(phone chiming)

1047
00:47:13.290 --> 00:47:18.290
Much better now that I
am looking at your...


1048
00:47:20.764 --> 00:47:22.413
(phone chimes)

1049
00:47:22.413 --> 00:47:25.163
(Sarah chuckles)

1050
00:47:27.020 --> 00:47:30.463
How about dinner?

1051
00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:34.903
I think so.

1052
00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:40.310
I'll hold off on that.

1053
00:47:40.310 --> 00:47:43.420
A cocktail and a bite.

1054
00:47:43.420 --> 00:47:48.420
No strings attached.

1055
00:47:48.449 --> 00:47:51.032
(phone chimes)

1056
00:47:55.960 --> 00:47:58.270
Your putt looks like shit dude.

1057
00:47:58.270 --> 00:47:59.250
Yeah.

1058
00:47:59.250 --> 00:48:00.700
Got any pointers?

1059
00:48:00.700 --> 00:48:02.050
See, your mechanics are off.

1060
00:48:02.050 --> 00:48:02.883
Let's see.

1061
00:48:09.470 --> 00:48:10.920
Discomfort in your right hip.

1062
00:48:11.780 --> 00:48:12.860
Yeah, how'd you know?

1063
00:48:12.860 --> 00:48:14.180
I mean it's pretty fucking obvious.

1064
00:48:14.180 --> 00:48:15.270
Putting all your weight on the left side.

1065
00:48:15.270 --> 00:48:16.310
You're overcompensating.

1066
00:48:16.310 --> 00:48:17.877
I've been to like a thousand
doctor since college


1067
00:48:17.877 --> 00:48:19.650
and no one can diagnose it.

1068
00:48:19.650 --> 00:48:21.300
I can help you.

1069
00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:22.681
Can you?
Oh yeah.


1070
00:48:22.681 --> 00:48:23.514
How.

1071
00:48:23.514 --> 00:48:24.870
Huachuma ceremony.

1072
00:48:24.870 --> 00:48:25.703
Pardon?

1073
00:48:25.703 --> 00:48:28.590
It's an ancient shamanic
medicine from the sacred cactus.


1074
00:48:28.590 --> 00:48:29.893
Also known as San Pedro.

1075
00:48:31.290 --> 00:48:33.313
Nick, are you a shaman?

1076
00:48:33.313 --> 00:48:35.040
Oh God, no.

1077
00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:38.580
For we are all our own shaman, Jake.

1078
00:48:38.580 --> 00:48:39.413
Oh we are?

1079
00:48:39.413 --> 00:48:40.246
The medicine will teach you.

1080
00:48:40.246 --> 00:48:42.650
It'll show you where the pain
is so you can extract it.


1081
00:48:42.650 --> 00:48:45.200
The grandfather is very wise.

1082
00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:46.033
Your grandfather?

1083
00:48:46.033 --> 00:48:47.580
No, no, no, he's an idiot.

1084
00:48:47.580 --> 00:48:49.990
The cactus, grandfather Huachuma.

1085
00:48:49.990 --> 00:48:51.990
Cut and cooked right here at Twin Pines.

1086
00:48:53.230 --> 00:48:54.560
Really?

1087
00:48:54.560 --> 00:48:55.393
Oh yeah.

1088
00:48:55.393 --> 00:48:56.226
(island music)

1089
00:48:58.520 --> 00:49:01.663
So how long have
you been on Match Strike?

1090
00:49:01.663 --> 00:49:04.841
It was my daughter's idea, I just...

1091
00:49:04.841 --> 00:49:06.250
Can I get you anything to drink?

1092
00:49:06.250 --> 00:49:07.390
A cocktail?

1093
00:49:07.390 --> 00:49:09.610
No thank you, just water for me.

1094
00:49:09.610 --> 00:49:10.830
Two martinis.

1095
00:49:10.830 --> 00:49:13.380
No, no, just one, 
I'm not drinking.

1096
00:49:13.380 --> 00:49:14.237
They're for me.

1097
00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:18.413
I took a nap, I just gotta
get back up to speed.


1098
00:49:22.690 --> 00:49:24.220
Oh shit.

1099
00:49:24.220 --> 00:49:25.610
Now what?

1100
00:49:25.610 --> 00:49:26.443
That's my boss, he
comes here all the time.


1101
00:49:26.443 --> 00:49:27.276
Well, no worries, let's chat with him.

1102
00:49:29.300 --> 00:49:31.160
Oh this fucking dickhead?

1103
00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:33.430
Sarah, you look beautiful.

1104
00:49:33.430 --> 00:49:35.033
Thank you.

1105
00:49:35.033 --> 00:49:36.834
Charlie Conroy.

1106
00:49:36.834 --> 00:49:38.610
Are you sober tonight, Charlie?

1107
00:49:38.610 --> 00:49:41.340
Dickhead, Jarvis.

1108
00:49:41.340 --> 00:49:43.460
I know you're gonna date
other men, that's fine.


1109
00:49:43.460 --> 00:49:47.740
But this individual just
is not in your class.


1110
00:49:47.740 --> 00:49:48.730
The fuck did you just say?

1111
00:49:48.730 --> 00:49:50.090
Hey, watch your language.

1112
00:49:50.090 --> 00:49:51.900
This is not Twin Pines.

1113
00:49:51.900 --> 00:49:54.050
You're gonna apologize
after I've taken my foot


1114
00:49:54.050 --> 00:49:55.023
outta your asshole.

1115
00:49:57.140 --> 00:49:59.563
You're right, I'm sorry.

1116
00:50:00.450 --> 00:50:03.620
I'm sorry, Conroy, that
you're such a loser.


1117
00:50:03.620 --> 00:50:05.990
Your daddy would be so ashamed of you.

1118
00:50:05.990 --> 00:50:08.550
Yeah, care put a little wager on that?

1119
00:50:08.550 --> 00:50:11.310
I would, but I don't
think you can afford it.


1120
00:50:11.310 --> 00:50:13.480
I'll bet you 25 grand on the Dixie

1121
00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:15.440
that I've got better golfers and people

1122
00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:17.530
than all those pricks at Magnolia Pointe.

1123
00:50:17.530 --> 00:50:20.640
I don't care what type of
shape Twin Pines is in.


1124
00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:21.800
We know that for a fact.

1125
00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:24.040
We have more integrity
in one blade of grass


1126
00:50:24.040 --> 00:50:25.910
than you've got in that
whole generic piece of shit


1127
00:50:25.910 --> 00:50:27.210
club of yours.

1128
00:50:27.210 --> 00:50:30.400
Well, let's put up a little wager.

1129
00:50:30.400 --> 00:50:31.743
Let's put up our clubs.

1130
00:50:33.070 --> 00:50:36.210
You'd put your club up
in a bet against me?


1131
00:50:36.210 --> 00:50:37.790
This is childish.

1132
00:50:37.790 --> 00:50:39.100
Name the terms.

1133
00:50:39.100 --> 00:50:40.330
Oh simple.

1134
00:50:40.330 --> 00:50:42.160
My club against your club.

1135
00:50:42.160 --> 00:50:43.163
Winner take all.

1136
00:50:44.246 --> 00:50:45.730
Bet your life.

1137
00:50:45.730 --> 00:50:46.863
You bet yours.

1138
00:50:52.770 --> 00:50:53.603
Charlie!

1139
00:50:56.310 --> 00:50:57.753
Oh, you faker, look at this.

1140
00:50:57.753 --> 00:51:00.010
He's trying to back out the bet.

1141
00:51:00.010 --> 00:51:01.310
Someone call an ambulance!

1142
00:51:01.310 --> 00:51:02.880
I think is having a heart attack.

1143
00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:05.521
I'll see you at work, Sarah.

1144
00:51:05.521 --> 00:51:06.354
It's okay.

1145
00:51:06.354 --> 00:51:08.110
(ambulance siren wailing)

1146
00:51:08.110 --> 00:51:10.470
Hey, can you grab
me a bottle of whiskey?

1147
00:51:10.470 --> 00:51:12.840
Nope, but I'll have something
better for you on the ride.


1148
00:51:12.840 --> 00:51:13.673
My man.

1149
00:51:16.330 --> 00:51:17.960
He was just talking to someone

1150
00:51:17.960 --> 00:51:19.940
and then he grabbed at his chest

1151
00:51:19.940 --> 00:51:24.600
and I've seen a heart
attack before, so yeah.


1152
00:51:24.600 --> 00:51:25.470
Well thank you, ma'am.

1153
00:51:25.470 --> 00:51:27.443
Would you like to ride with your husband?

1154
00:51:28.983 --> 00:51:30.780
I'll meet him there later.

1155
00:51:30.780 --> 00:51:31.613
He should be okay.

1156
00:51:31.613 --> 00:51:32.590
Good thing he has you.

1157
00:51:35.537 --> 00:51:38.787
(ambulance door thuds)

1158
00:51:43.143 --> 00:51:46.726
(ambulance sirens wailing)

1159
00:51:57.864 --> 00:52:01.450
Good morning, Charles, I'm Dr. Lloyd.

1160
00:52:01.450 --> 00:52:02.550
How you feeling buddy?

1161
00:52:03.460 --> 00:52:04.490
I've been better.

1162
00:52:04.490 --> 00:52:05.950
Well, you're pretty lucky that your friend

1163
00:52:05.950 --> 00:52:09.450
knew what was going on,
because you have suffered


1164
00:52:09.450 --> 00:52:11.447
a mild heart attack.

1165
00:52:11.447 --> 00:52:14.070
Yeah, I've been lucky
doc and this ain't it.


1166
00:52:14.070 --> 00:52:16.623
How many drinks a week
would you say you consume?


1167
00:52:17.770 --> 00:52:18.853
Not that many.

1168
00:52:19.820 --> 00:52:21.400
Well, according to your chart,

1169
00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:26.320
your blood alcohol level is
currently 0.21, that's high.


1170
00:52:26.320 --> 00:52:27.240
Is it?

1171
00:52:27.240 --> 00:52:29.330
That's after eight hours.

1172
00:52:29.330 --> 00:52:31.970
Yeah, that's a little bit high.

1173
00:52:31.970 --> 00:52:34.200
So we'd really like to
keep you one more night,


1174
00:52:34.200 --> 00:52:36.710
send you to the cath lab in the
morning and run a few tests.


1175
00:52:36.710 --> 00:52:37.830
What do you think?

1176
00:52:37.830 --> 00:52:39.400
Yeah, sure.

1177
00:52:39.400 --> 00:52:43.570
But Charles I highly
recommend some extreme


1178
00:52:43.570 --> 00:52:44.953
lifestyle changes.

1179
00:52:45.790 --> 00:52:48.003
Okay, so what are we talking about?

1180
00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:50.133
Get sober.

1181
00:52:52.090 --> 00:52:53.390
That's a little drastic.

1182
00:52:54.240 --> 00:52:57.350
I'll be back in a couple
hours of check on you, buddy.


1183
00:52:57.350 --> 00:52:58.183
All right.

1184
00:53:08.290 --> 00:53:10.150
Dammit, Conroy.

1185
00:53:10.150 --> 00:53:10.983
Enough, just talk to me.

1186
00:53:10.983 --> 00:53:11.816
All right.

1187
00:53:14.020 --> 00:53:15.270
Well, if you don't get well soon,

1188
00:53:15.270 --> 00:53:17.020
you're gonna lose everything you have.

1189
00:53:17.020 --> 00:53:19.350
Also, Nick's looking for a job.

1190
00:53:19.350 --> 00:53:21.780
Jake's actually really good for the place.

1191
00:53:21.780 --> 00:53:23.560
And he likes it here.

1192
00:53:23.560 --> 00:53:24.560
Do they know about me yet?

1193
00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:25.980
Yeah, they wanna come see you.

1194
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:27.990
No and don't tell anyone else.

1195
00:53:27.990 --> 00:53:29.340
If I'm gonna play in the
Dixie, I'm gonna get-


1196
00:53:29.340 --> 00:53:31.560
Well, if you wanna plan the Dixie,

1197
00:53:31.560 --> 00:53:33.350
do you think you should?

1198
00:53:33.350 --> 00:53:34.183
Yeah.

1199
00:53:34.183 --> 00:53:35.016
But Conroy, you just-

1200
00:53:35.016 --> 00:53:37.350
Dammit Fred, I should be dead right now

1201
00:53:37.350 --> 00:53:41.640
and the only person that has
come to see me is my bartender.


1202
00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:43.781
Where all the friends I used to have?

1203
00:53:43.781 --> 00:53:45.673
What friends?

1204
00:53:45.673 --> 00:53:46.823
I don't fucking know.

1205
00:53:48.750 --> 00:53:49.583
I got no one.

1206
00:53:50.850 --> 00:53:55.493
My dad built Twin Pines
and I can't lose it.


1207
00:53:56.580 --> 00:53:58.190
Don't worry about the club, okay.

1208
00:53:58.190 --> 00:53:59.490
We'll figure all that out.

1209
00:54:01.180 --> 00:54:03.180
When do we get you back then?

1210
00:54:03.180 --> 00:54:04.680
They'll let me out tomorrow.

1211
00:54:06.200 --> 00:54:07.650
Did you bring my phone?

1212
00:54:07.650 --> 00:54:08.623
Of course.

1213
00:54:10.610 --> 00:54:12.830
You're gonna look at
porn in this, aren't you?


1214
00:54:12.830 --> 00:54:14.170
Yes.

1215
00:54:14.170 --> 00:54:15.120
Get well, Conroy.

1216
00:54:16.090 --> 00:54:16.923
Grandma goes wild... hmmm.

1217
00:54:16.923 --> 00:54:17.756
(quirky music plays)

1218
00:54:29.562 --> 00:54:31.979
(door thuds)

1219
00:54:33.857 --> 00:54:36.940
(golf cart whirring)

1220
00:54:39.996 --> 00:54:41.080
Oh morning buddy.

1221
00:54:41.080 --> 00:54:42.180
Everything's great.

1222
00:54:42.180 --> 00:54:43.994
That's close.
Okay.


1223
00:54:43.994 --> 00:54:45.606
Complimentary club day.

1224
00:54:45.606 --> 00:54:46.772
Hey, what are you doing?

1225
00:54:46.772 --> 00:54:47.605
Have a good round.

1226
00:54:47.605 --> 00:54:49.120
Hey, listen, we need to find
a replacement for Conroy


1227
00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:49.970
in the tournament.

1228
00:54:49.970 --> 00:54:51.230
We need to fix your putt.

1229
00:54:51.230 --> 00:54:52.270
No, we don't need to
fix, my putt's good man.


1230
00:54:52.270 --> 00:54:54.420
Well we do, we need to
drink the juice too.


1231
00:54:54.420 --> 00:54:56.090
The cactus juice.
I'm not drinking the juice.


1232
00:54:56.090 --> 00:54:57.130
Conroy just had a heart attack.

1233
00:54:57.130 --> 00:54:58.201
We gotta drink the cactus, Jakey Bear!

1234
00:54:58.201 --> 00:54:59.570
Just get in the cart,
you're freaking people out.


1235
00:54:59.570 --> 00:55:01.070
I'm not drinking the cactus, man.

1236
00:55:01.070 --> 00:55:02.060
We're not doing hallucinogenics.

1237
00:55:02.060 --> 00:55:04.130
Channel your energy into fixing your hip

1238
00:55:04.130 --> 00:55:05.474
and to healing Conroy's heart.

1239
00:55:05.474 --> 00:55:06.307
We'll figure it out, just get outta here.

1240
00:55:06.307 --> 00:55:08.770
Sorry dude, I think
you pretty much got it.


1241
00:55:08.770 --> 00:55:10.102
Nothing I can really
tell you about putting.


1242
00:55:10.102 --> 00:55:10.935
You just gotta aim for the hole!

1243
00:55:10.935 --> 00:55:11.768
You were doing it,
just continue to do it!

1244
00:55:11.768 --> 00:55:12.601
(tribal music)

1245
00:55:15.628 --> 00:55:18.711
(golf cart whirring)

1246
00:55:39.723 --> 00:55:41.603
Hola brother, Jake.

1247
00:55:43.020 --> 00:55:44.490
How's it going Eñejo?

1248
00:55:44.490 --> 00:55:46.200
Pacha-mama welcomes you here today.

1249
00:55:46.200 --> 00:55:48.410
I bet she does, what is this?

1250
00:55:48.410 --> 00:55:51.420
This is Twin Pine source
of spiritual energy, Jake.


1251
00:55:51.420 --> 00:55:54.290
It's also a very viable source
of supplementary income.


1252
00:55:54.290 --> 00:55:55.670
Formally the 10th fairway.

1253
00:55:55.670 --> 00:55:56.817
What do you mean supplementary income?

1254
00:55:56.817 --> 00:55:58.140
Oh, we sell them on the internet.

1255
00:55:58.140 --> 00:55:59.490
It's a house plant.

1256
00:55:59.490 --> 00:56:00.690
Oh my God, seriously?

1257
00:56:00.690 --> 00:56:01.670
Yeah.

1258
00:56:01.670 --> 00:56:04.410
Myself and Eñejo will be back shortly.

1259
00:56:04.410 --> 00:56:05.523
Reset your mind.

1260
00:56:06.360 --> 00:56:09.270
Put into focus what you'd
like to work on today.


1261
00:56:09.270 --> 00:56:10.680
I was working on my putt, I thought.

1262
00:56:10.680 --> 00:56:12.370
Okay, that's exactly what we're doing.

1263
00:56:12.370 --> 00:56:15.670
Except we're going to
be doing it with your...


1264
00:56:15.670 --> 00:56:16.503
My hat.

1265
00:56:16.503 --> 00:56:17.350
Your...

1266
00:56:18.252 --> 00:56:19.085
Oh, my memory.

1267
00:56:19.085 --> 00:56:20.375
Your ma...

1268
00:56:20.375 --> 00:56:21.208
Mom.

1269
00:56:21.208 --> 00:56:23.240
Not your mom, no, your m- mi-

1270
00:56:23.240 --> 00:56:24.210
Oh my mind?

1271
00:56:24.210 --> 00:56:25.640
Mind.
Oh fuck.


1272
00:56:25.640 --> 00:56:26.720
Yeah, sure.

1273
00:56:26.720 --> 00:56:27.553
Why didn't you just say that?

1274
00:56:27.553 --> 00:56:28.386
I don't know.

1275
00:56:28.386 --> 00:56:29.219
But we'll see you soon.

1276
00:56:35.070 --> 00:56:35.903
Fuck.

1277
00:56:49.320 --> 00:56:50.153
Oh man.

1278
00:56:53.150 --> 00:56:54.210
Is this like a whole weird thing?

1279
00:56:54.210 --> 00:56:56.060
I'm not gonna do a whole weird thing.

1280
00:56:57.010 --> 00:56:58.870
I don't wanna be culturally insensitive.

1281
00:56:58.870 --> 00:57:02.050
Friends today, we connect
with the ancient ones.


1282
00:57:02.050 --> 00:57:05.423
Not by looking up, but by looking in.

1283
00:57:06.460 --> 00:57:11.063
We will be extracting our
past and healing our present.


1284
00:57:13.120 --> 00:57:16.460
One thing we must remember
in is that there is no past,


1285
00:57:16.460 --> 00:57:17.633
there is no future.

1286
00:57:18.510 --> 00:57:19.543
There is only now.

1287
00:57:21.800 --> 00:57:25.053
Now is forever, and now is never.

1288
00:57:26.380 --> 00:57:29.550
Jake, you're experiencing
some blockage in your hip.


1289
00:57:29.550 --> 00:57:33.400
Your right hip.

1290
00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:35.090
This is my right hip.

1291
00:57:35.090 --> 00:57:36.630
A fear of moving forward.

1292
00:57:36.630 --> 00:57:38.140
You're exactly right.

1293
00:57:38.140 --> 00:57:41.693
Something or someone is preventing
Jake from moving forward.


1294
00:57:47.680 --> 00:57:50.010
We will be awake today, Jake

1295
00:57:50.010 --> 00:57:53.400
and perhaps the ancient
ones will be able to channel


1296
00:57:53.400 --> 00:57:55.893
even more energy through your hickey.

1297
00:57:57.240 --> 00:57:59.427
I don't have a hickey.

1298
00:57:59.427 --> 00:58:04.150
Hickeyawaiku. Hickeyawaiku.

1299
00:58:04.150 --> 00:58:06.800
Drink this medicina for it as a gift

1300
00:58:06.800 --> 00:58:07.813
from the pacha-mama.

1301
00:58:22.537 --> 00:58:23.370
Oh man.

1302
00:58:25.420 --> 00:58:26.820
I thought it was gonna be good.

1303
00:58:26.820 --> 00:58:28.283
It's foolish to think that. Hickeyawaiku.

1304
00:58:35.698 --> 00:58:37.837
Hondacord. Veolvo.

1305
00:58:37.837 --> 00:58:39.340
Okay.

1306
00:58:39.340 --> 00:58:40.173
What now?

1307
00:58:41.540 --> 00:58:42.373
Now we wait.

1308
00:58:43.710 --> 00:58:45.630
Feel free to wander
about with your thoughts


1309
00:58:45.630 --> 00:58:47.233
and your feelings.

1310
00:58:48.637 --> 00:58:51.762
Let go. Hickeyawaiku.

1311
00:58:53.672 --> 00:58:55.488
Hickeyawaiku. Hickeyawaiku.

1312
00:58:55.488 --> 00:58:56.707
Veolvo.

1313
00:58:56.707 --> 00:59:01.192
Hickeyawaiku. Hickeyawaiku.

1314
00:59:01.192 --> 00:59:02.358
Neesonn.

1315
00:59:02.358 --> 00:59:03.475
Altima.

1316
00:59:06.120 --> 00:59:07.573
The ceremony has begun.

1317
00:59:09.490 --> 00:59:11.283
Here, have another.

1318
00:59:12.712 --> 00:59:14.245
(tribal music)

1319
00:59:18.820 --> 00:59:20.113
What the hell?

1320
00:59:23.080 --> 00:59:23.913
Idiots.

1321
00:59:23.913 --> 00:59:24.746
What did it say?

1322
00:59:27.900 --> 00:59:28.733
Wow!

1323
00:59:30.270 --> 00:59:31.103
Sir.

1324
00:59:32.430 --> 00:59:33.580
What's up?

1325
00:59:33.580 --> 00:59:36.380
That cart just blew past
me like a bat outta hell.


1326
00:59:36.380 --> 00:59:38.730
He must have been doing 50 miles power.

1327
00:59:38.730 --> 00:59:40.510
Don't you have any regulations?

1328
00:59:40.510 --> 00:59:41.343
No, sir.

1329
00:59:41.343 --> 00:59:43.110
Here at Twin Pines, you can
drive as fast as you like.


1330
00:59:43.110 --> 00:59:44.300
And I personally took the governor

1331
00:59:44.300 --> 00:59:45.640
off each and every one of these carts

1332
00:59:45.640 --> 00:59:48.370
so you can knock out 18
holes in less than two hours.


1333
00:59:48.370 --> 00:59:50.813
Hell, our sales grew up 33%.

1334
00:59:52.230 --> 00:59:53.393
You have a nice day.

1335
00:59:54.540 --> 00:59:56.633
Cocktail?
I don't think so.


1336
00:59:58.567 --> 01:00:00.067
This place is a joke, daddy.

1337
01:00:03.337 --> 01:00:04.170
(golf cart whirs)

1338
01:00:04.170 --> 01:00:05.003
(folk music)

1339
01:00:16.831 --> 01:00:18.560
[Gary] Is this a
parking lot or a pasture?

1340
01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:19.393
Come on.

1341
01:00:19.393 --> 01:00:21.413
[Adrian] Looks like Coachella.
Hey, what is that?


1342
01:00:21.413 --> 01:00:23.322
A pro shop?
I think so.


1343
01:00:23.322 --> 01:00:25.620
Hey dad, it's a pro shop.
Can we get two tickets


1344
01:00:25.620 --> 01:00:27.280
for golf please?

1345
01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:29.350
[Gary] Who would actually
pay to come here?


1346
01:00:29.350 --> 01:00:31.800
[Adrian] I feel like I'm gonna get robbed.

1347
01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:33.627
[Jarvis] I've never seen anything like it.

1348
01:00:33.627 --> 01:00:36.215
Is that a fucking crater?

1349
01:00:36.215 --> 01:00:37.090
(Adrian laughs)

1350
01:00:37.090 --> 01:00:39.350
Where are we?
I don't know.


1351
01:00:39.350 --> 01:00:41.073
[Jarvis] This place is pathetic.

1352
01:00:48.510 --> 01:00:49.384
It's terrible.

1353
01:00:49.384 --> 01:00:50.420
What a joke.

1354
01:00:50.420 --> 01:00:52.070
[Thomas] What the hell is this?

1355
01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:58.093
How do we get across?
I don't know.


1356
01:00:59.468 --> 01:01:01.768
[Adrian] Maybe we can
screen from the trees.


1357
01:01:03.390 --> 01:01:05.920
[Thomas] This is so shitty,
I feel bad for the tractor.


1358
01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:07.920
[Gary] I can't wait to watch them fail.

1359
01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:10.993
[Adrian] You losers.
Oh my God.


1360
01:01:32.646 --> 01:01:35.063
(Jake sighs)

1361
01:01:54.050 --> 01:01:55.300
Golf isn't the problem.

1362
01:02:07.557 --> 01:02:09.643
Feeling okay, buddy?

1363
01:02:09.643 --> 01:02:11.643
I need to find Brandy.

1364
01:02:13.060 --> 01:02:16.063
Hey, honeysuckle brother.

1365
01:02:18.696 --> 01:02:20.114
I'm telling you, bro.

1366
01:02:20.114 --> 01:02:23.093
I was like a
lion dude all night, bro.

1367
01:02:23.093 --> 01:02:24.555
Just pounding ass.

1368
01:02:24.555 --> 01:02:26.005
Oh yeah, what was his name?

1369
01:02:27.029 --> 01:02:28.840
I'm not gay, brother.

1370
01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:30.333
You are gay, dude.

1371
01:02:30.333 --> 01:02:31.800
I'm pansexual.

1372
01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:32.633
What does that mean?

1373
01:02:32.633 --> 01:02:34.713
Like you have sex with cookware?

1374
01:02:39.260 --> 01:02:42.480
Ah, really, you thought I'd
fall for that again, dude?


1375
01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:43.696
What?

1376
01:02:43.696 --> 01:02:45.770
Hey, hey, get this on video.

1377
01:02:45.770 --> 01:02:48.270
Let's see if Sir Hissyfit
likes a fat in his face.


1378
01:02:51.976 --> 01:02:54.496
Shainski, that's not Sir Hissyfit.

1379
01:02:54.496 --> 01:02:55.329
What?

1380
01:02:57.952 --> 01:03:00.187
(Shane screams)

1381
01:03:00.187 --> 01:03:01.437
Shainski, no.

1382
01:03:03.994 --> 01:03:04.827
What do I have to do bro?

1383
01:03:04.827 --> 01:03:05.660
What do I do?

1384
01:03:05.660 --> 01:03:08.200
Oh dude, you have
to suck the poison out.

1385
01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:09.136
What?

1386
01:03:09.136 --> 01:03:11.553
Suck it bro, I'm gonna die.

1387
01:03:16.028 --> 01:03:19.111
(golf cart whirring)

1388
01:03:22.900 --> 01:03:24.490
Suck my butt, dude.

1389
01:03:24.490 --> 01:03:26.440
Suck my butt.

1390
01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:30.110
Help, snake bite, snake bite.

1391
01:03:30.110 --> 01:03:33.440
Listen, dude, if you love
me, you'll do it bro.


1392
01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:36.167
Please, please suck my butt.

1393
01:03:37.455 --> 01:03:38.538
Suck my butt.

1394
01:03:42.940 --> 01:03:44.163
Oh that's what's up?

1395
01:03:46.370 --> 01:03:48.000
Yeah.

1396
01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:49.183
Fuck yeah, brother.

1397
01:03:50.410 --> 01:03:52.030
Oh baby.

1398
01:03:52.030 --> 01:03:53.870
Oh my God, yes.

1399
01:03:53.870 --> 01:03:58.040
Hey bro, I will never
ever forget this dude.


1400
01:03:58.040 --> 01:03:59.690
[Mikels] You better forget this!

1401
01:03:59.690 --> 01:04:02.350
Don't stop dude, don't stop!

1402
01:04:02.350 --> 01:04:03.993
Oh, I fucking love you, dude.

1403
01:04:05.206 --> 01:04:06.700
Oh my God.

1404
01:04:06.700 --> 01:04:07.533
Wrong way buddy.

1405
01:04:07.533 --> 01:04:09.540
Huh?
Wrong way, buddy.


1406
01:04:09.540 --> 01:04:12.050
Let's get you back to the
clubhouse for some soup.


1407
01:04:12.050 --> 01:04:13.833
It's time for integration.

1408
01:04:17.439 --> 01:04:20.522
(golf cart whirring)

1409
01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:31.389
Shit, mi familia!

1410
01:04:31.389 --> 01:04:32.541
What are you doin-

1411
01:04:32.541 --> 01:04:33.374
Oops, sorry.

1412
01:04:33.374 --> 01:04:34.810
You see my penis?

1413
01:04:34.810 --> 01:04:39.810
Mr. Boyd, you are breaking into a million

1414
01:04:40.120 --> 01:04:41.763
tiny pieces right now.

1415
01:04:42.990 --> 01:04:43.823
It rules.

1416
01:04:44.660 --> 01:04:47.500
Well, don't you fit in here just fine.

1417
01:04:47.500 --> 01:04:48.870
I think so, I like it.

1418
01:04:48.870 --> 01:04:50.730
And Nick says there's soup.

1419
01:04:50.730 --> 01:04:51.643
It's super!

1420
01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:54.883
No thank you.

1421
01:04:56.980 --> 01:04:58.350
No?

1422
01:04:58.350 --> 01:05:00.003
Okay, soup yourself.

1423
01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:09.910
Wait till my sister finds out about this.

1424
01:05:09.910 --> 01:05:11.686
You loser!

1425
01:05:11.686 --> 01:05:14.103
(both laugh)

1426
01:05:16.087 --> 01:05:17.603
Oh, fuck, Brandy.

1427
01:05:20.287 --> 01:05:21.637
I think I got it all bro.

1428
01:05:23.720 --> 01:05:25.116
I love you, bro.

1429
01:05:25.116 --> 01:05:26.583
I fucking love you, bro.

1430
01:05:28.932 --> 01:05:30.458
You saved my life.

1431
01:05:30.458 --> 01:05:32.160
Bitch, you saved my life!

1432
01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:34.472
This snake's not poisonous.

1433
01:05:34.472 --> 01:05:35.305
What?

1434
01:05:36.704 --> 01:05:38.287
It's not poisonous.

1435
01:05:39.262 --> 01:05:44.262
I mean the bite might hurt a
little bit, but you'll be fine.


1436
01:05:45.624 --> 01:05:47.473
You're gonna fucking die, bro!

1437
01:05:49.623 --> 01:05:50.456
(man grunting)

1438
01:05:50.456 --> 01:05:51.289
(rock music)

1439
01:06:03.310 --> 01:06:05.160
[Nick] Jake, great work today, man.

1440
01:06:05.160 --> 01:06:06.093
Real breakthrough.

1441
01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.090
And I know, I know, I know.

1442
01:06:09.090 --> 01:06:10.770
You can't wait for tomorrow's ceremony.

1443
01:06:10.770 --> 01:06:11.603
We'll do this again.

1444
01:06:11.603 --> 01:06:13.170
[Jake] No, I'm never
doing this again, man.


1445
01:06:13.170 --> 01:06:14.890
[Nick] Oh-okie dokie,
you get some good sleep.


1446
01:06:14.890 --> 01:06:16.890
Yeah, goodnight.
All right, cheers.


1447
01:06:17.778 --> 01:06:20.861
(car engine revving)

1448
01:06:31.140 --> 01:06:33.793
Gummy bear, you home?

1449
01:06:50.783 --> 01:06:51.616
Brandy.

1450
01:06:54.140 --> 01:06:54.973
Brandy.

1451
01:06:55.930 --> 01:06:57.893
Hey, can we talk?

1452
01:06:59.230 --> 01:07:01.030
Did you quit, baby?

1453
01:07:01.030 --> 01:07:02.523
Oh no, no I can't.

1454
01:07:03.407 --> 01:07:04.330
I'm going to sleep.

1455
01:07:04.330 --> 01:07:05.330
No, wait, no.

1456
01:07:05.330 --> 01:07:07.080
We need to talk about college.

1457
01:07:07.080 --> 01:07:08.913
No, why?

1458
01:07:09.893 --> 01:07:11.943
Because I had an epiphany.

1459
01:07:13.470 --> 01:07:17.210
You know, you've been blaming
golf for all of our problems.


1460
01:07:17.210 --> 01:07:18.623
It's not golf.

1461
01:07:20.950 --> 01:07:22.320
What do you mean?

1462
01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:23.540
Why?

1463
01:07:23.540 --> 01:07:27.540
It's me, it's always been me.

1464
01:07:27.540 --> 01:07:29.400
I fucked up.

1465
01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:31.253
I cheated on you, Brandy.

1466
01:07:32.309 --> 01:07:34.890
Fuck, how can you trust me?

1467
01:07:34.890 --> 01:07:36.383
I don't deserve you.

1468
01:07:37.883 --> 01:07:38.800
I'm stupid.

1469
01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:42.943
What is wrong with you?

1470
01:07:45.574 --> 01:07:46.424
Are you on drugs?

1471
01:07:48.500 --> 01:07:49.333
No.

1472
01:07:50.890 --> 01:07:52.633
Am I on drugs?

1473
01:07:54.630 --> 01:07:59.305
Yeah, yeah, a little bit,
but it's just like a cactus.


1474
01:07:59.305 --> 01:08:00.330
It's not what you think.

1475
01:08:00.330 --> 01:08:04.940
It's a cactus and you chop
it up and you boil it.


1476
01:08:04.940 --> 01:08:09.410
And you have to sit in a tent
and you have to drink this.


1477
01:08:09.410 --> 01:08:13.310
And when you wake up,
everything is a million pieces


1478
01:08:15.126 --> 01:08:15.960
and then you...

1479
01:08:20.090 --> 01:08:21.720
What were we talking about?

1480
01:08:21.720 --> 01:08:23.280
You're just saying all this
'cause you're fucked up.


1481
01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:24.330
No, it's not.

1482
01:08:24.330 --> 01:08:26.040
I'm not fucked up, I was.

1483
01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:27.507
You should have seen me before.

1484
01:08:27.507 --> 01:08:32.307
This is all happening again
because of golf, Jake.


1485
01:08:32.307 --> 01:08:33.710
No, it's not because of golf.

1486
01:08:33.710 --> 01:08:36.580
I realized the problem this time, it's me.

1487
01:08:36.580 --> 01:08:39.347
I fucked up, but I understand it now.

1488
01:08:40.775 --> 01:08:42.775
Just get the fuck out.

1489
01:08:44.215 --> 01:08:45.223
What?

1490
01:08:45.223 --> 01:08:47.037
Don't come back.

1491
01:08:47.037 --> 01:08:47.954
Are you serious?

1492
01:08:47.954 --> 01:08:49.231
Yeah.

1493
01:08:49.231 --> 01:08:51.064
Just get the fuck out.

1494
01:08:55.763 --> 01:08:58.846
(instrumental music)

1495
01:09:47.390 --> 01:09:49.240
[Rodney] Hey there, you Conroy?

1496
01:09:49.240 --> 01:09:50.890
Yeah, Rodney?
Yeah, that's me.


1497
01:09:50.890 --> 01:09:51.723
Come on in.

1498
01:09:52.830 --> 01:09:55.356
How you doing today, where are we headed?

1499
01:09:55.356 --> 01:09:56.887
Straight to hell, my man.

1500
01:09:56.887 --> 01:09:59.060
But drop me off the Twin Pines first.

1501
01:09:59.060 --> 01:10:02.276
You got it, need to pick
up some weed anyway.


1502
01:10:02.276 --> 01:10:05.359
(instrumental music)

1503
01:10:26.006 --> 01:10:28.173
Oh, I gotta take a shit.

1504
01:10:42.030 --> 01:10:44.090
Hey, are you okay?

1505
01:10:44.090 --> 01:10:46.420
Yeah Ms. Gladys, never better.

1506
01:10:46.420 --> 01:10:47.490
I feel like a million bucks.

1507
01:10:47.490 --> 01:10:48.910
Beer?

1508
01:10:48.910 --> 01:10:50.250
I really shouldn't.

1509
01:10:50.250 --> 01:10:51.333
Okay fella.

1510
01:10:57.140 --> 01:10:59.340
Charlie Conroy, you are cut off.

1511
01:10:59.340 --> 01:11:01.300
I was seriously just getting ready

1512
01:11:01.300 --> 01:11:02.370
to give that back to her.

1513
01:11:02.370 --> 01:11:03.790
Gladys, do you want this?

1514
01:11:03.790 --> 01:11:05.420
Knock yourself out.

1515
01:11:05.420 --> 01:11:06.933
Inside, now.

1516
01:11:11.934 --> 01:11:14.684
They're coming, they're coming.

1517
01:11:18.289 --> 01:11:19.122
[Everyone] Surprise!!

1518
01:11:19.122 --> 01:11:19.955
(dance muscic)

1519
01:11:20.982 --> 01:11:23.502
We did it, we did it!

1520
01:11:23.502 --> 01:11:24.335
We did it.

1521
01:11:26.127 --> 01:11:27.710
Oh, welcome back chief.

1522
01:11:27.710 --> 01:11:29.120
Great job not dying.

1523
01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:30.620
Jesus Christ, what is wrong with you?

1524
01:11:30.620 --> 01:11:32.110
We waited so long for you so long.

1525
01:11:32.110 --> 01:11:34.180
Okay, let's get this party started.

1526
01:11:34.180 --> 01:11:35.680
Go ahead Fred, load us up.

1527
01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:36.960
He doesn't drink anymore,

1528
01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:38.733
he just got out of the hospital, Nick.

1529
01:11:40.170 --> 01:11:41.813
Actually, Nick, I can't.

1530
01:11:43.490 --> 01:11:48.387
The doctor says I need to give
the ticker time to catch up.


1531
01:11:48.387 --> 01:11:50.715
I have to stay away
from booze for a bit.

1532
01:11:50.715 --> 01:11:51.548
Great story bro.

1533
01:11:51.548 --> 01:11:52.381
Here you go.

1534
01:11:53.390 --> 01:11:54.643
No, no, I can't.

1535
01:11:57.240 --> 01:11:58.073
Here's to the boss.

1536
01:11:58.073 --> 01:11:59.443
Long with the chief.

1537
01:11:59.443 --> 01:12:01.776
[All] Long live the chief.

1538
01:12:03.228 --> 01:12:04.950
Hey, back to work, everyone.

1539
01:12:04.950 --> 01:12:06.630
Let's go back to work.

1540
01:12:06.630 --> 01:12:08.437
We did it, we got him!

1541
01:12:09.559 --> 01:12:10.892
We got him good.

1542
01:12:11.754 --> 01:12:14.000
Let's get an inventory.

1543
01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
Catch me up on
the state of the club.

1544
01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.450
The golf club is
operating marginally, sir,


1545
01:12:18.450 --> 01:12:21.140
with as many underpaid and
under-qualified employees


1546
01:12:21.140 --> 01:12:24.550
as this mediocre town can
provide within budget, of course.


1547
01:12:24.550 --> 01:12:27.150
Like I said, this machine is
pretty much running itself,


1548
01:12:27.150 --> 01:12:28.220
I can say proudly.

1549
01:12:28.220 --> 01:12:30.660
The bar is fully stocked as usual.

1550
01:12:30.660 --> 01:12:33.440
But since you're absence,
we actually have a surplus.


1551
01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:35.280
Yeah, Eñejo just finished
all the new signage


1552
01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:37.940
and all the greens and
fairways are in top condition.


1553
01:12:37.940 --> 01:12:39.510
That's obviously, that's not true,

1554
01:12:39.510 --> 01:12:42.020
but seems like you need good news.

1555
01:12:42.020 --> 01:12:43.100
Great work.

1556
01:12:43.100 --> 01:12:45.240
Now let's talk tournament.

1557
01:12:45.240 --> 01:12:48.450
How's everybody looking,
everybody playing okay?


1558
01:12:48.450 --> 01:12:50.040
You're not playing.

1559
01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:51.287
What do you mean?

1560
01:12:51.287 --> 01:12:54.850
You just got outta the
hospital, you are not playing.


1561
01:12:54.850 --> 01:12:56.920
Yeah, man, everyone knows
about the heart attack.


1562
01:12:56.920 --> 01:12:58.630
Also the bet, everyone
knows about the bet.


1563
01:12:58.630 --> 01:13:00.623
That was ill advised.

1564
01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:07.390
Look, I need to go
practice so that you all


1565
01:13:07.390 --> 01:13:08.560
can keep your jobs.

1566
01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:09.503
I need a tee time.

1567
01:13:10.476 --> 01:13:11.443
Oh, yes sir.

1568
01:13:13.380 --> 01:13:16.440
Dogleg, we got a tee
time for boss man step.


1569
01:13:16.440 --> 01:13:18.470
[Dogleg] We're all clear,
there's no one here today.


1570
01:13:18.470 --> 01:13:20.463
Oh, okay, thank you so much.

1571
01:13:21.380 --> 01:13:23.570
Conroy, you're not playing.

1572
01:13:23.570 --> 01:13:26.633
Not listening to you and
we will reconvene later.


1573
01:13:28.490 --> 01:13:30.440
Does anyone listen to me around here?

1574
01:13:33.170 --> 01:13:35.710
He's acting strange, no?

1575
01:13:35.710 --> 01:13:37.783
Maybe he had like a
bad dream or something.


1576
01:13:39.253 --> 01:13:40.086
Yeah, yeah.

1577
01:13:40.086 --> 01:13:40.919
(somber music)

1578
01:14:04.033 --> 01:14:06.533
(duck cooing)

1579
01:14:31.648 --> 01:14:34.481
(Conroy groaning)

1580
01:14:48.313 --> 01:14:50.353
Dude, are you trying to kill me.

1581
01:14:51.372 --> 01:14:52.913
Are you worried about
that bet with Jarvis?


1582
01:14:54.280 --> 01:14:56.080
You've been looking at other jobs?

1583
01:14:58.140 --> 01:14:58.973
Right.

1584
01:14:58.973 --> 01:15:00.870
I told Fred that to motivate you, man.

1585
01:15:00.870 --> 01:15:02.220
Hell, if I had
kids, them and their kids

1586
01:15:02.220 --> 01:15:03.760
would owe you for my bar tab.

1587
01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:05.330
You kidding?

1588
01:15:05.330 --> 01:15:07.520
Twin Pines is losing steam though.

1589
01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:08.848
With that attitude.

1590
01:15:08.848 --> 01:15:11.503
Well, I just don't know
where we went wrong.


1591
01:15:12.570 --> 01:15:13.490
Me neither.

1592
01:15:16.192 --> 01:15:18.620
Is there anyone at this club
that knows how to play golf?


1593
01:15:18.620 --> 01:15:21.400
I mean, you've seen all we got.

1594
01:15:21.400 --> 01:15:22.726
Shainski might jump in for you.

1595
01:15:22.726 --> 01:15:23.559
Okay.

1596
01:15:24.513 --> 01:15:26.013
What the fuck am I gonna do?

1597
01:15:27.810 --> 01:15:29.010
Probably lose the bet.

1598
01:15:37.890 --> 01:15:38.723
This is good for the heart, right?

1599
01:15:38.723 --> 01:15:39.556
(Conroy plays guitar)

1600
01:15:46.152 --> 01:15:50.027
Well, I don't understand
what God's done to me.


1601
01:15:51.594 --> 01:15:56.594
'cause I'm short in the
britches and long off the tee...


1602
01:15:56.651 --> 01:16:00.967
I've hit every fairway
since I've been alive...


1603
01:16:02.427 --> 01:16:06.918
But Jesus won't give me no sexual drive.

1604
01:16:07.909 --> 01:16:12.373
Well I've got lots of balls
and I'm always in clubs.


1605
01:16:12.373 --> 01:16:16.181
And I've hooked up with skinnies
and crazies and chubs...


1606
01:16:17.695 --> 01:16:21.857
I've dated some ladies
that were awful fun...


1607
01:16:21.857 --> 01:16:26.623
But I ain't never got to the hole-in-one.

1608
01:16:41.232 --> 01:16:43.048
(club music)

1609
01:17:50.382 --> 01:17:51.801
What the fuck are
we gonna do about Shane?

1610
01:17:51.801 --> 01:17:53.852
Yeah, that was pretty bad.

1611
01:17:53.852 --> 01:17:54.879
How you doing?

1612
01:17:54.879 --> 01:17:55.742
Hello sir.

1613
01:17:55.742 --> 01:17:57.442
Come on here, let's grab a seat.

1614
01:17:59.900 --> 01:18:01.836
You want a drink or something?

1615
01:18:01.836 --> 01:18:02.669
Yeah!

1616
01:18:06.500 --> 01:18:10.540
Okay, so you're bit all
over the place out there


1617
01:18:11.422 --> 01:18:13.160
and we really need to win this tournament

1618
01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:14.950
otherwise we're history.

1619
01:18:14.950 --> 01:18:15.783
Tournament?

1620
01:18:17.610 --> 01:18:18.443
Right.

1621
01:18:20.730 --> 01:18:23.290
[Fred] Everyone, I'd like
to introduce you to Khalil,


1622
01:18:23.290 --> 01:18:26.810
our newest member and scratch golfer.

1623
01:18:26.810 --> 01:18:28.037
Is he now? Would you maybe
be interested in playing


1624
01:18:29.570 --> 01:18:30.820
in this little tournament
we got coming up?


1625
01:18:30.820 --> 01:18:34.010
We got an extra spot and
sure wanna beat the shit


1626
01:18:34.010 --> 01:18:35.230
out of Magnolia Pointe.

1627
01:18:35.230 --> 01:18:37.281
Fuck yeah man.

1628
01:18:37.281 --> 01:18:38.114
Yes.

1629
01:18:38.114 --> 01:18:38.963
I like your enthusiasm.

1630
01:18:40.660 --> 01:18:41.493
Really?

1631
01:18:41.493 --> 01:18:42.326
Oh yeah.

1632
01:18:42.326 --> 01:18:44.710
That's fucking- 10 seconds ago,

1633
01:18:44.710 --> 01:18:46.540
we were just talking
about how screwed we were.


1634
01:18:46.540 --> 01:18:47.440
Hell yeah, dude.

1635
01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:48.993
There we go, dream team, done.

1636
01:18:51.190 --> 01:18:54.370
Well, as my dad used to say,

1637
01:18:54.370 --> 01:18:59.370
a birdie marks anything of
excellence, and you guys,


1638
01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:02.611
y'all are my birdies.

1639
01:19:03.500 --> 01:19:05.290
Right, since we aren't drinking.

1640
01:19:05.290 --> 01:19:06.130
Cheers to that.

1641
01:19:06.130 --> 01:19:07.297
Oh cheers.

1642
01:19:07.297 --> 01:19:08.130
Cheers.

1643
01:19:08.130 --> 01:19:09.963
Cheers.
Cheers to that.


1644
01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:12.278
Yeah, cheers bro.

1645
01:19:12.278 --> 01:19:13.111
Welcome!

1646
01:19:13.111 --> 01:19:15.390
All right, let's fucking get to work.

1647
01:19:15.390 --> 01:19:16.223
[Fred] Get to work.

1648
01:19:16.223 --> 01:19:17.056
Let's go with these guys.

1649
01:19:17.056 --> 01:19:18.156
We're gonna kick their ass.

1650
01:19:18.156 --> 01:19:20.322
(upbeat music)

1651
01:19:25.658 --> 01:19:28.491
(golf club bangs)

1652
01:19:33.540 --> 01:19:34.513
Cheers, cheers.

1653
01:19:39.330 --> 01:19:41.117
Okie, dokie, all right, Nick.

1654
01:19:41.117 --> 01:19:42.217
Right, right, right.

1655
01:19:56.324 --> 01:19:59.002
(golf club bangs)

1656
01:19:59.002 --> 01:20:02.085
(golf ball whistles)

1657
01:20:55.943 --> 01:21:00.884
(dramatic music)

1658
01:21:32.620 --> 01:21:35.100
[Marvin Gleeman] Cardinals
chirping in the Pines.


1659
01:21:35.100 --> 01:21:38.750
Wind whisping through the Bermuda grass.

1660
01:21:38.750 --> 01:21:41.690
Alligators nipping at our heels.

1661
01:21:41.690 --> 01:21:44.200
It's that time of year again, folks.

1662
01:21:44.200 --> 01:21:46.040
[Lucy Overwood] Welcome
to the 30th annual,


1663
01:21:46.040 --> 01:21:49.180
Dixie invitational captain's
choice golf tournament


1664
01:21:49.180 --> 01:21:52.130
on this beautiful day at
Twin Pines golf course.


1665
01:21:52.130 --> 01:21:53.360
Is that local news?

1666
01:21:53.360 --> 01:21:55.260
Yeah, Jarvis is trying to
make a big deal out of this.


1667
01:21:55.260 --> 01:21:56.319
Marvin Gleeman.

1668
01:21:56.319 --> 01:21:57.152
Marvin!

1669
01:21:57.152 --> 01:21:58.117
I did blow with him once.

1670
01:21:58.117 --> 01:22:00.055
[Dogleg] Just once?
So many times.


1671
01:22:00.055 --> 01:22:02.413
[Marvin] Welcome to
another Dixie invitational


1672
01:22:02.413 --> 01:22:03.795
at Twin Pines.

1673
01:22:04.870 --> 01:22:07.920
Today, the big focus is Adrian Boyd,

1674
01:22:07.920 --> 01:22:10.630
the five times champion team captain

1675
01:22:10.630 --> 01:22:13.530
and on the other end, Jake Baxter,

1676
01:22:13.530 --> 01:22:17.233
Charlie Conroy's new club
pro here at Twin Pines.


1677
01:22:17.233 --> 01:22:18.066
Now we hear-

1678
01:22:18.066 --> 01:22:19.099
[Pop] Oh shit.

1679
01:22:19.099 --> 01:22:21.460
[Marvin] A slight rivalry
brewing between these two clubs.


1680
01:22:21.460 --> 01:22:24.090
What are Jake Baxter's chances, John,

1681
01:22:24.090 --> 01:22:26.670
and what does his competition
look like this year?


1682
01:22:26.670 --> 01:22:27.870
[John Ingersall] These
guys from Twin Pines


1683
01:22:27.870 --> 01:22:29.386
who are calling themselves The Birdies

1684
01:22:29.386 --> 01:22:31.780
will make anything but that.

1685
01:22:31.780 --> 01:22:34.040
And they have as much chance
as a preacher's daughter


1686
01:22:34.040 --> 01:22:34.873
in Vegas.

1687
01:22:34.873 --> 01:22:37.830
- Well, strong words, 
John, strong words.

1688
01:22:37.830 --> 01:22:38.840
But that's right.

1689
01:22:38.840 --> 01:22:40.550
But Baxter had a promising future

1690
01:22:40.550 --> 01:22:44.150
before he mysteriously
vanished from the landscape


1691
01:22:44.150 --> 01:22:48.510
of amateur golf amids personal
troubles over 10 years ago.


1692
01:22:48.510 --> 01:22:52.280
Today he looks for redemption as he plays

1693
01:22:52.280 --> 01:22:55.010
against his former teammate, Adrian Boyd,

1694
01:22:55.010 --> 01:22:57.750
the tenured pro from Magnolia Pointe.

1695
01:22:57.750 --> 01:23:00.810
- That's right and they
have a surprise entrant.


1696
01:23:00.810 --> 01:23:04.960
International legend, the
pro golfer, John Nightly.


1697
01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:06.269
- Whoa.

1698
01:23:06.269 --> 01:23:09.280
[John Nightly] Baby, what
do you want from a man?!


1699
01:23:09.280 --> 01:23:12.224
His great aunt was a
member of Magnolia Pointe,


1700
01:23:12.224 --> 01:23:13.432
did you know that?

1701
01:23:13.432 --> 01:23:14.634
- I did not know that.

1702
01:23:14.634 --> 01:23:17.610
- Come on, Boyd, we got this.

1703
01:23:17.610 --> 01:23:18.947
Not today, bitch.

1704
01:23:20.460 --> 01:23:22.413
Oh I can't wait to hit this!

1705
01:23:23.327 --> 01:23:25.850
Ooh, shimmy, shimmy.

1706
01:23:26.820 --> 01:23:28.453
So you can't play now.

1707
01:23:29.850 --> 01:23:31.653
Just playing by your rules.

1708
01:23:35.406 --> 01:23:36.319
[Nightly] Oh, whoopsie.

1709
01:23:36.319 --> 01:23:37.800
Hi.

1710
01:23:37.800 --> 01:23:38.840
Hello.

1711
01:23:38.840 --> 01:23:40.280
How are things?

1712
01:23:40.280 --> 01:23:41.193
Not here.

1713
01:23:46.628 --> 01:23:49.393
Whoo! Smashed potatoes!

1714
01:23:49.393 --> 01:23:52.357
- [Marvin] And that's the first
shot at the Dixie Classic,


1715
01:23:52.357 --> 01:23:54.380
the tournament of marginal playing,

1716
01:23:54.380 --> 01:23:56.920
and culturally insensitive verbiage.

1717
01:23:56.920 --> 01:23:58.000
All right!

1718
01:23:58.000 --> 01:23:59.425
[Ingersall] That's right next up,

1719
01:23:59.425 --> 01:24:00.760
we have captain Adrian Boyd

1720
01:24:00.760 --> 01:24:04.180
for team protein from Magnolia Pointe.

1721
01:24:04.180 --> 01:24:05.890
Are these guys for real?

1722
01:24:05.890 --> 01:24:09.100
- Look, I don't know anything
about these fucking hicks.


1723
01:24:09.100 --> 01:24:12.936
So just stick to the
script, you Irish twat.


1724
01:24:14.160 --> 01:24:16.060
[Marvin] Adrian Boyd.

1725
01:24:16.060 --> 01:24:19.850
This douchebag has never seen
a real day of work in his life


1726
01:24:19.850 --> 01:24:20.683
and his hands.

1727
01:24:20.683 --> 01:24:24.440
Well, they are softer
than a newborn's ass.


1728
01:24:24.440 --> 01:24:25.993
Let's see what he does.

1729
01:24:29.910 --> 01:24:34.196
Whoa, what a shot and
we are underway folks.


1730
01:24:34.196 --> 01:24:36.775
HADOUKEN!

1731
01:24:36.775 --> 01:24:38.100
- Oh God, that's gross.

1732
01:24:38.100 --> 01:24:39.408
Pretty dumb.

1733
01:24:39.408 --> 01:24:41.333
(intense music)

1734
01:24:45.740 --> 01:24:47.332
[Nightly] That was a send!

1735
01:24:51.269 --> 01:24:53.840
(audience cheering)

1736
01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:56.433
[Marvin] Next up is
Baxter and team Birdies.


1737
01:24:59.280 --> 01:25:00.113
That'll work.

1738
01:25:01.562 --> 01:25:02.895
Kah-fucking
-PING!

1739
01:25:05.120 --> 01:25:06.561
Shit.

1740
01:25:06.561 --> 01:25:09.311
(water sloshing)

1741
01:25:14.225 --> 01:25:17.392
(audience applauding)

1742
01:25:20.250 --> 01:25:21.350
Captain's choice.

1743
01:25:21.350 --> 01:25:23.273
Which ball will you
choose, Captain Baxter?


1744
01:25:23.273 --> 01:25:24.106
I think we'll be using my ball, sir.

1745
01:25:25.106 --> 01:25:26.931
(music intensifies)

1746
01:25:33.590 --> 01:25:34.663
Too easy, baby.

1747
01:25:42.600 --> 01:25:44.000
Yes, sir.
There she is.


1748
01:25:44.922 --> 01:25:48.100
(audience applauding)

1749
01:25:48.100 --> 01:25:49.700
This one's going down the pipe.

1750
01:25:54.353 --> 01:25:55.853
[Nightly] Party boy!

1751
01:25:57.447 --> 01:26:00.880
[Marvin] Oh, John Nightly
shows us his famous beer shower


1752
01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:02.290
celebration.

1753
01:26:02.290 --> 01:26:04.260
I am the best golfer ever!

1754
01:26:05.258 --> 01:26:06.645
[Marvin] Now for the birdies.

1755
01:26:06.645 --> 01:26:07.857
[Adrian] Oh my God.

1756
01:26:07.857 --> 01:26:09.410
I fucking love you guys.

1757
01:26:09.410 --> 01:26:10.763
[Marvin] Baxter up first.

1758
01:26:13.113 --> 01:26:14.113
(cheers) Hey, yeah.

1759
01:26:16.405 --> 01:26:18.205
[Gary] Is this a joke?

1760
01:26:18.205 --> 01:26:19.450
Oh my God, I hate poor people.

1761
01:26:19.450 --> 01:26:21.250
[Marvin] Now at the tee, Nick Hayes.

1762
01:26:22.230 --> 01:26:23.063
Whoa.

1763
01:26:25.607 --> 01:26:28.774
(audience applauding)

1764
01:26:30.030 --> 01:26:30.863
Sweet.

1765
01:26:31.770 --> 01:26:33.883
[Marvin] Next up, 
Emily Calhoun.

1766
01:26:36.790 --> 01:26:38.090
[Gary] Ooh, I'm a girl!

1767
01:26:38.090 --> 01:26:39.490
I might ask her out later.

1768
01:26:41.259 --> 01:26:43.710
And last up, Khalil Al
-Asmari,

1769
01:26:43.710 --> 01:26:45.783
the newest member of Twin Pines.

1770
01:26:46.920 --> 01:26:48.910
[Ingersall This guy's
got all types of talent.


1771
01:26:48.910 --> 01:26:50.960
[Marvin] The late
edition from team Birdies


1772
01:26:50.960 --> 01:26:53.100
is really lighting it up.

1773
01:26:53.100 --> 01:26:54.350
Where did he come from?

1774
01:26:54.350 --> 01:26:55.423
Who is this guy?

1775
01:26:57.921 --> 01:26:59.415
(audience applauding)

1776
01:26:59.415 --> 01:27:01.515
Twin Pines is so
lucky to have this guy.

1777
01:27:03.270 --> 01:27:06.113
[Marvin] Captain Protein rips another one.

1778
01:27:15.134 --> 01:27:16.067
(regurgitates)

1779
01:27:16.067 --> 01:27:17.740
Oh, that's unfortunate.

1780
01:27:17.740 --> 01:27:20.540
Tell you what Marv, John
lightly does not look well.


1781
01:27:20.540 --> 01:27:21.923
No, he does not.

1782
01:27:22.760 --> 01:27:23.603
About time.

1783
01:27:24.450 --> 01:27:25.583
I need some coke!

1784
01:27:26.720 --> 01:27:28.733
Huh, he's fine.

1785
01:27:37.990 --> 01:27:41.157
(audience applauding)

1786
01:27:44.994 --> 01:27:46.493
[Man] What'd you use bro?

1787
01:27:51.173 --> 01:27:54.423
(audience applauding)

1788
01:28:05.120 --> 01:28:08.000
Well, well, well, look who showed up.

1789
01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.545
You are not off the hook.

1790
01:28:10.545 --> 01:28:11.397
Dammit, seriously.

1791
01:28:11.397 --> 01:28:15.700
But I love you Jake Baxter
no matter what you do.


1792
01:28:15.700 --> 01:28:18.117
Now go kick this prick's ass.

1793
01:28:19.580 --> 01:28:20.413
My girl.

1794
01:28:25.620 --> 01:28:26.453
Daughter.

1795
01:28:28.450 --> 01:28:29.283
Daddy.

1796
01:28:31.660 --> 01:28:35.827
[Marvin] We are tied up
folks! Onto the back nine.


1797
01:28:43.924 --> 01:28:46.273
- Oh my God,
that made my dick hard.

1798
01:28:51.693 --> 01:28:52.844
Yeah, I'll stick with it.

1799
01:28:52.844 --> 01:28:54.640
I'm gonna stick with this golf thing.

1800
01:29:03.720 --> 01:29:04.970
Oh my gosh, you missed.

1801
01:29:09.696 --> 01:29:12.909
(audience cheering)

1802
01:29:12.909 --> 01:29:13.742
[Marvin] That's a Birdie for
Emily Calhoun of Team Birdies.


1803
01:29:13.742 --> 01:29:14.575
[Ingersall] Showing us their
namesake in more than one way.


1804
01:29:14.575 --> 01:29:16.908
An eagle for team Protein.

1805
01:29:34.020 --> 01:29:34.853
Yeah boy!

1806
01:29:41.667 --> 01:29:42.803
(cheers)

1807
01:29:42.803 --> 01:29:43.886
- Woo.
- Nice.


1808
01:29:44.792 --> 01:29:47.625
(golf club bangs)

1809
01:30:29.607 --> 01:30:30.600
We're on the last whole game.

1810
01:30:30.600 --> 01:30:33.560
Team protein needs
something big happen here.


1811
01:30:33.560 --> 01:30:35.640
There are one back from a playoff.

1812
01:30:35.640 --> 01:30:36.633
Here we go.

1813
01:30:41.948 --> 01:30:42.870
[Gary] Roper.

1814
01:30:42.870 --> 01:30:43.723
There you go.

1815
01:30:47.050 --> 01:30:49.693
It's actually better than I thought.

1816
01:30:51.720 --> 01:30:55.433
Jesus, you're worse than Thomas!

1817
01:31:01.401 --> 01:31:04.234
(golf club bangs)

1818
01:31:05.520 --> 01:31:08.030
In certain circles,
that's a really good shot.


1819
01:31:08.030 --> 01:31:10.470
[Marvin] Twin Pines needs just par to win

1820
01:31:10.470 --> 01:31:12.400
and they're putting for Birdie.

1821
01:31:12.400 --> 01:31:14.567
They've got to make this shot to win.

1822
01:31:20.770 --> 01:31:22.480
Holy shit folks.

1823
01:31:22.480 --> 01:31:23.550
They're blowing it.

1824
01:31:23.550 --> 01:31:25.610
[Ingersall] I can't believe
this, Magnolia Pointe


1825
01:31:25.610 --> 01:31:27.563
is still in this match.

1826
01:31:29.960 --> 01:31:30.793
[Adrian] You putt like a girl.

1827
01:31:30.793 --> 01:31:31.626
[Jake] It's all right.

1828
01:31:38.390 --> 01:31:42.840
[Marvin] Unbelievable, meltdown
from these unpredictable


1829
01:31:42.840 --> 01:31:44.120
Birdies from Twin Pines.

1830
01:31:44.120 --> 01:31:47.680
If they can't make it,
they lose, or we gotta tie


1831
01:31:47.680 --> 01:31:50.870
and go into a three
hole, one-on-one playoff.


1832
01:31:50.870 --> 01:31:51.970
[Ingersall] Baxter wants this one.

1833
01:31:55.070 --> 01:31:56.350
In the hole!

1834
01:31:56.350 --> 01:31:57.823
We gotta tie folks.

1835
01:31:59.700 --> 01:32:02.790
[Marvin] We go into a three
hole playoff, winner take all.


1836
01:32:02.790 --> 01:32:04.940
The team captains must play head, head,

1837
01:32:04.940 --> 01:32:07.460
individual match play to break the tie.

1838
01:32:07.460 --> 01:32:09.930
That's good because John
Nightly is disqualified


1839
01:32:09.930 --> 01:32:13.560
as he has passed out on hole 16

1840
01:32:13.560 --> 01:32:15.800
and weirdly nobody is
paying any attention.


1841
01:32:15.800 --> 01:32:17.990
Just another day on
the course for Nightly.


1842
01:32:17.990 --> 01:32:21.593
Magnolia Pointe is away,
so Boyd will tee off first.


1843
01:32:24.528 --> 01:32:26.336
HADOUKEN.

1844
01:32:27.420 --> 01:32:29.469
Fuck.

1845
01:32:43.735 --> 01:32:46.320
(birds chirping)

1846
01:32:46.320 --> 01:32:48.600
Baxter for eagle.

1847
01:32:48.600 --> 01:32:50.257
You know what to do Jakey Bear.

1848
01:32:50.257 --> 01:32:51.780
Oh my God.

1849
01:32:51.780 --> 01:32:53.460
Not only are you
a part of this universe,

1850
01:32:53.460 --> 01:32:56.550
but you are the universe.

1851
01:32:56.550 --> 01:32:57.720
For sure, thanks dude.

1852
01:32:57.720 --> 01:32:59.530
You are that tiny little white ball.

1853
01:32:59.530 --> 01:33:01.492
Nick, I'm trying to focus here, man.

1854
01:33:01.492 --> 01:33:02.780
You're that tiny little
white ball that happens


1855
01:33:02.780 --> 01:33:04.250
to have a big
fat hickey on your neck.

1856
01:33:04.250 --> 01:33:06.120
I don't have a fucking hickey,
just get outta here, dude.


1857
01:33:06.120 --> 01:33:07.543
Good luck.
So annoying.


1858
01:33:13.620 --> 01:33:14.610
Mark it.

1859
01:33:14.610 --> 01:33:17.693
[Ingersall] Big mistake and a
disappointment for that Eagle.


1860
01:33:20.850 --> 01:33:22.466
You know what to do Adrian-

1861
01:33:22.466 --> 01:33:23.594
Fuck bro.

1862
01:33:23.594 --> 01:33:24.990
I'm sorry, I'm sorry about that.

1863
01:33:32.707 --> 01:33:35.918
And Boyd makes the putt in the hole.

1864
01:33:35.918 --> 01:33:36.918
Whoa baby.

1865
01:33:44.570 --> 01:33:45.770
Yet another Birdie.

1866
01:33:45.770 --> 01:33:47.070
Big missed opportunity.

1867
01:33:47.070 --> 01:33:50.760
Baxter still manages to be
one under in the playoffs.


1868
01:33:50.760 --> 01:33:55.757
One under for Boyd and
Baxter and on to the next.


1869
01:33:55.757 --> 01:33:57.840
How do my calves look?

1870
01:33:57.840 --> 01:33:59.540
Always beautiful, you know that?

1871
01:34:01.240 --> 01:34:02.073
[Nick] Yes sir.

1872
01:34:06.697 --> 01:34:08.327
HADOUKEN!

1873
01:34:08.327 --> 01:34:09.993
(audience applauding)

1874
01:34:09.993 --> 01:34:11.243
(laughs) From earlier.

1875
01:34:19.520 --> 01:34:22.050
It's fine, I don't mind a shorter walk.

1876
01:34:22.050 --> 01:34:23.790
Did you dye your hair more blonde?

1877
01:34:23.790 --> 01:34:24.623
What?

1878
01:34:24.623 --> 01:34:25.456
Did you dye your hair more blonde?

1879
01:34:25.456 --> 01:34:26.740
This is fucking natural.

1880
01:34:32.990 --> 01:34:34.570
That's what I'm talking about, baby.

1881
01:34:34.570 --> 01:34:37.003
[Marvin] And Boyd makes the putt.

1882
01:34:39.777 --> 01:34:42.042
(audience cheering)

1883
01:34:42.042 --> 01:34:43.420
It's in the hole.

1884
01:34:43.420 --> 01:34:45.152
On to the next.

1885
01:34:45.152 --> 01:34:45.985
Birdie, Birdie.

1886
01:34:45.985 --> 01:34:46.818
Yessir!

1887
01:34:51.850 --> 01:34:53.860
[Marvin] We're on the final hole, people.

1888
01:34:53.860 --> 01:34:55.610
This is a 300 yard par four.

1889
01:34:55.610 --> 01:34:59.060
And I believe both these
gentlemen are capable


1890
01:34:59.060 --> 01:35:01.400
of getting it near the green,

1891
01:35:01.400 --> 01:35:04.840
but it will take
a lot of club, John.

1892
01:35:04.840 --> 01:35:07.290
And even more balls, Marvin.

1893
01:35:07.290 --> 01:35:08.830
Yes, John.

1894
01:35:08.830 --> 01:35:12.263
It will take big, huge testicles.

1895
01:35:25.290 --> 01:35:27.643
Boyd with an amazing drive.

1896
01:35:27.643 --> 01:35:30.080
This is my storybook ending.

1897
01:35:30.080 --> 01:35:31.667
This is my storybook ending!

1898
01:35:35.660 --> 01:35:36.493
[Ingersall] And some
inappropriate gestures


1899
01:35:36.493 --> 01:35:37.326
being exchanged folks.

1900
01:35:38.870 --> 01:35:41.590
So if you have any kids
that are watching at home,


1901
01:35:41.590 --> 01:35:43.770
you should really rethink your parenting

1902
01:35:43.770 --> 01:35:45.570
and grab a Swinger Lite.

1903
01:35:45.570 --> 01:35:47.460
Long day on the links?

1904
01:35:47.460 --> 01:35:48.430
Pound a Swinger.

1905
01:35:48.430 --> 01:35:51.320
We love Swinger.

1906
01:35:51.320 --> 01:35:52.613
That's right, John.

1907
01:35:54.880 --> 01:35:58.220
Speaking of Swinger, Adrian
Boyd could still swing himself


1908
01:35:58.220 --> 01:36:00.370
into a birdie if he
can get on the green

1909
01:36:00.370 --> 01:36:02.230
with his next shot.

1910
01:36:02.230 --> 01:36:04.450
Or Baxter's short game
could fail him once again.


1911
01:36:04.450 --> 01:36:05.350
That's possible.

1912
01:36:08.632 --> 01:36:09.793
It's the perfect hole?

1913
01:36:18.990 --> 01:36:20.498
We are the Birdies...

1914
01:36:21.798 --> 01:36:23.337
[Nick Whispers] Birdies, birdies

1915
01:36:23.337 --> 01:36:26.512
[Team Birdies] Birdies, birdies, birdies

1916
01:36:26.512 --> 01:36:30.805
Birdies, birdies, birdies!

1917
01:36:30.805 --> 01:36:31.763
Here we go.

1918
01:36:31.763 --> 01:36:33.308
[All] Birdies. Birdies!

1919
01:36:33.308 --> 01:36:34.739
There we go.

1920
01:36:34.739 --> 01:36:36.844
Let's go!

1921
01:36:36.844 --> 01:36:38.269
Louder!

1922
01:36:38.269 --> 01:36:41.529
[Team Birdies] Birdies, birdies, birdies.

1923
01:36:41.529 --> 01:36:43.649
Birdies, baby!

1924
01:36:43.649 --> 01:36:45.165
BIRDIES FOREVER!

1925
01:36:45.165 --> 01:36:49.990
I am Jake fucking
Baxter and I am BACK!

1926
01:36:49.990 --> 01:36:52.151
Wooohooo!

1927
01:36:52.151 --> 01:36:55.350
Nick, hand me that motherfucking two-

1928
01:36:55.350 --> 01:36:56.183
That's exactly what I wanted.

1929
01:36:56.183 --> 01:36:57.016
How'd you know?

1930
01:36:57.016 --> 01:36:57.862
(Nick laughs)

1931
01:36:57.862 --> 01:36:59.746
Win or lose, that's cool
that you know I was gonna...


1932
01:36:59.746 --> 01:37:00.579
That's pretty cool.

1933
01:37:00.579 --> 01:37:01.412
[Nick] Right right, we're- yeah!

1934
01:37:01.412 --> 01:37:02.330
Here we go.

1935
01:37:07.170 --> 01:37:08.800
[Marvin] It's a beautiful shot.

1936
01:37:08.800 --> 01:37:12.470
That is a sniper shot,
the best I've ever seen.


1937
01:37:12.470 --> 01:37:14.890
[Pop] Damn it's a SNIPER SHOT!

1938
01:37:14.890 --> 01:37:16.950
[Marvin] Could this even be possible?

1939
01:37:16.950 --> 01:37:18.663
Has anyone ever?

1940
01:37:19.541 --> 01:37:21.877
It's a hole in ONE

1941
01:37:21.877 --> 01:37:23.293
I can't believe it!

1942
01:37:23.293 --> 01:37:25.661
Jake Baxter just aced a par four!

1943
01:37:25.661 --> 01:37:28.493
He need a Birdie
but he got an albatross.

1944
01:37:28.493 --> 01:37:30.671
[Pop] Yeah, my boy!

1945
01:37:30.671 --> 01:37:35.462
[Marvin] Adrian Boyd is out of this match!

1946
01:37:37.119 --> 01:37:39.952
(people cheering)

1947
01:37:49.856 --> 01:37:50.856
Oh my God.

1948
01:37:53.309 --> 01:37:56.142
(people cheering)

1949
01:38:06.410 --> 01:38:10.023
Well, so I guess
I work for you now.

1950
01:38:13.160 --> 01:38:13.993
Partners?

1951
01:38:15.660 --> 01:38:16.760
Something like that.

1952
01:38:19.810 --> 01:38:21.888
I think you should probably kiss me now.

1953
01:38:21.888 --> 01:38:23.150
Oh yeah.
- Yeah.


1954
01:38:24.980 --> 01:38:26.210
Conroy, that was the fu-

1955
01:38:26.210 --> 01:38:28.220
Oh my God, did not know
you guys are about to kiss.


1956
01:38:28.220 --> 01:38:29.320
I am so sorry.

1957
01:38:29.320 --> 01:38:30.160
Dude, I am so sorry.

1958
01:38:30.160 --> 01:38:32.790
We weren't about to kiss, we were kissing.

1959
01:38:32.790 --> 01:38:35.083
Thry were kissing.
I'll let it slide.


1960
01:38:36.660 --> 01:38:39.360
I've never seen anything like that, Jake.

1961
01:38:39.360 --> 01:38:40.463
You saved my ass.

1962
01:38:42.310 --> 01:38:44.663
Yeah, I kinda did, didn't I?

1963
01:38:45.498 --> 01:38:47.260
It's the best job I ever, dude.

1964
01:38:47.260 --> 01:38:50.193
Anything you want, you got it.

1965
01:38:50.193 --> 01:38:51.440
You're home now.

1966
01:38:51.440 --> 01:38:52.890
You hear me, the both of you.

1967
01:38:53.940 --> 01:38:56.263
Appreciate that, thank you Conroy.

1968
01:38:58.173 --> 01:39:02.003
I guess I'll have my attorney
start to make arrangements.


1969
01:39:02.950 --> 01:39:05.653
You got my number, I'll
expect keys in two weeks.


1970
01:39:06.720 --> 01:39:08.480
I'm gonna call the motel,

1971
01:39:08.480 --> 01:39:10.130
have 'em save our favorite suite.

1972
01:39:11.040 --> 01:39:13.083
Not here, later, later.

1973
01:39:14.660 --> 01:39:15.493
All right, yeah.

1974
01:39:15.493 --> 01:39:17.370
I'll see you at Thanksgiving, Mr. Boyd.

1975
01:39:17.370 --> 01:39:19.263
We don't have to
talk about any of this.

1976
01:39:21.170 --> 01:39:22.003
Adrian.

1977
01:39:30.550 --> 01:39:34.090
Look, man, I still don't like you

1978
01:39:36.035 --> 01:39:37.223
but, goddammit.

1979
01:39:42.960 --> 01:39:43.793
You respect me?

1980
01:39:43.793 --> 01:39:45.040
No, I realized soon as I said that,

1981
01:39:45.040 --> 01:39:46.170
it sounded like I was gonna say respect.

1982
01:39:46.170 --> 01:39:50.463
It was not, it's more like,
I think you're a good golfer.


1983
01:39:58.084 --> 01:40:00.834
(birds chirping)

1984
01:40:05.330 --> 01:40:08.420
Well, looks like you
got a new club, boss.

1985
01:40:08.420 --> 01:40:10.320
Yeah, don't get too excited.

1986
01:40:10.320 --> 01:40:11.293
I might fuck it up.

1987
01:40:12.300 --> 01:40:13.623
I'm not gonna!

1988
01:40:35.208 --> 01:40:37.270
White people.

1989
01:40:37.270 --> 01:40:39.670
So, when are we gonna work
on my putting game, huh?


1990
01:40:39.670 --> 01:40:41.410
Oh, putting is not my department.

1991
01:40:41.410 --> 01:40:43.520
I would defer to my short
game professor, Nick.


1992
01:40:43.520 --> 01:40:44.353
He'll take it from here.

1993
01:40:44.353 --> 01:40:45.420
Won't you follow me, Ms. Gladys.

1994
01:40:45.420 --> 01:40:47.912
His putting sucks the ass.

1995
01:40:47.912 --> 01:40:48.745
I'm working on it.

1996
01:40:48.745 --> 01:40:49.578
Yeah okay.

1997
01:40:49.578 --> 01:40:52.350
What the hell are we
gonna do about these guys?


1998
01:40:52.350 --> 01:40:53.460
They can sleep it off.

1999
01:40:53.460 --> 01:40:55.310
Yeah, I feel like we should
call the greens keepers.


2000
01:40:55.310 --> 01:40:57.880
I feel like you're probably right.

2001
01:40:57.880 --> 01:41:00.020
Hey greens, we could use a
clean up at the driving range.


2002
01:41:00.020 --> 01:41:01.950
Got three naked dudes laying here.

2003
01:41:01.950 --> 01:41:04.760
Copy clubhouse, 
Adrian is on his way.

2004
01:41:04.760 --> 01:41:06.830
If you guys are talking
about my dad again,


2005
01:41:06.830 --> 01:41:08.233
you can screw off!

2006
01:41:09.450 --> 01:41:10.700
He's happy.

2007
01:41:10.700 --> 01:41:12.426
Thank you very much.

2008
01:41:12.426 --> 01:41:15.580
Do me a favor, when you're
done fixing that boys,


2009
01:41:15.580 --> 01:41:17.180
come up here and fix this for me.

2010
01:41:17.180 --> 01:41:18.013
Fix what?

2011
01:41:22.366 --> 01:41:26.050
(golf cart buzzing)

2012
01:41:26.050 --> 01:41:26.883
Hey what'd I miss?

2013
01:41:26.883 --> 01:41:29.853
Oh, just another day at
Twin Pines, you know.


2014
01:41:29.853 --> 01:41:30.686
I tell you what, I'm thirsty.

2015
01:41:30.686 --> 01:41:32.740
I'll take a water 'cause I'm pregnant.

2016
01:41:32.740 --> 01:41:33.790
Well, I mean we're pregnant.

2017
01:41:33.790 --> 01:41:34.623
She's pregnant.

2018
01:41:35.870 --> 01:41:37.253
Well, this round's on me.

2019
01:41:38.534 --> 01:41:39.650
Thanks so much.

2020
01:41:39.650 --> 01:41:40.483
Yeah.

2021
01:41:41.639 --> 01:41:45.736
To Twin Pines, may the
tradition continue to continue.


2022
01:41:45.736 --> 01:41:47.319
- [All] Twin Pines.
