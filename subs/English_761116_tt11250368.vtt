00:00:48.753 --> 00:00:51.920
(somber piano music)

2
00:01:19.099 --> 00:01:22.266
(gentle piano music)

3
00:02:32.641 --> 00:02:35.724
(gentle piano music)

4
00:02:45.748 --> 00:02:47.248
- And we are here.

5
00:02:49.223 --> 00:02:50.933
Don't be afraid to leave
some of your belongings


6
00:02:50.933 --> 00:02:51.766
in the car.

7
00:02:51.766 --> 00:02:53.286
It will be less
weight for you to carry

8
00:02:53.286 --> 00:02:54.574
and Pat will be sticking around

9
00:02:54.574 --> 00:02:57.942
to make sure all your things are safe.

10
00:02:57.942 --> 00:02:59.155
Take your time.

11
00:02:59.155 --> 00:03:00.572
There is no rush.

12
00:03:04.267 --> 00:03:06.219
They always take their time.

13
00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:07.595
- It's 'cause they're slow.

14
00:03:07.595 --> 00:03:09.725
They need their iPhone to
understand all this crap.


15
00:03:09.725 --> 00:03:12.511
- (laughing) Are you
clocking out after this?


16
00:03:12.511 --> 00:03:14.652
- Yeah, my wife misses me.

17
00:03:14.652 --> 00:03:15.485
- [Valerie] How is she?

18
00:03:15.485 --> 00:03:16.695
- She's fine.

19
00:03:16.695 --> 00:03:18.205
Pregnant.

20
00:03:18.205 --> 00:03:19.884
- That's right.

21
00:03:19.884 --> 00:03:21.415
(chuckles) Congrats.

22
00:03:21.415 --> 00:03:22.248
- I guess.

23
00:03:23.095 --> 00:03:25.635
- I can never tell if
you're being serious or not.


24
00:03:25.635 --> 00:03:26.468
- Hm.

25
00:03:28.344 --> 00:03:29.853
- All right, everybody ready?

26
00:03:29.853 --> 00:03:30.824
- [All] Yeah.

27
00:03:30.824 --> 00:03:32.574
- Follow me this way.

28
00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:47.393
(gentle guitar music)

29
00:03:47.393 --> 00:03:48.713
(footsteps clattering)

30
00:03:48.713 --> 00:03:51.463
(water dripping)

31
00:04:24.935 --> 00:04:26.245
Now, it's very important that you guys

32
00:04:26.245 --> 00:04:28.573
don't touch the walls of the cave.

33
00:04:28.573 --> 00:04:31.362
The oils in your hands can
corrode them over time.


34
00:04:31.362 --> 00:04:32.195
(light tense music)

35
00:04:32.195 --> 00:04:34.778
- Hey, why is that blocked off?

36
00:04:35.711 --> 00:04:38.133
- We don't go in there.

37
00:04:38.133 --> 00:04:40.783
- [Man] Why? Is there
some kind of monster?


38
00:04:40.783 --> 00:04:44.273
- (chuckles) The caves are very unstable.

39
00:04:44.273 --> 00:04:47.236
A section of the caves
collapsed over 20 years ago


40
00:04:47.236 --> 00:04:49.706
and it's been closed to
the public ever since.


41
00:04:49.706 --> 00:04:51.718
But don't worry.

42
00:04:51.718 --> 00:04:54.301
These paths are perfectly safe.

43
00:04:55.651 --> 00:04:58.401
Anybody have any other questions?

44
00:05:01.101 --> 00:05:01.934
Anything?

45
00:05:05.711 --> 00:05:07.199
Yes, you.

46
00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:08.299
- Yeah, I was
wondering if that one story

47
00:05:08.299 --> 00:05:12.102
about the missing girl
in the caves is true.


48
00:05:12.102 --> 00:05:14.798
- You know, I've never
been asked that before.


49
00:05:14.798 --> 00:05:16.981
- [Man] Really? So you
don't know what happened?


50
00:05:16.981 --> 00:05:18.857
- No one really knows.

51
00:05:18.857 --> 00:05:21.752
My father was working
here at the time actually


52
00:05:21.752 --> 00:05:26.025
and he told me he heard
the girl found her way out


53
00:05:26.025 --> 00:05:28.133
by listening to the water.

54
00:05:28.133 --> 00:05:30.397
And that's all I really know.

55
00:05:30.397 --> 00:05:31.733
- [Man] The water?

56
00:05:31.733 --> 00:05:33.967
- Yes, from the creek.

57
00:05:33.967 --> 00:05:35.749
- That's not what I heard.

58
00:05:35.749 --> 00:05:37.512
- What did you hear?

59
00:05:37.512 --> 00:05:38.865
- I heard the girl
couldn't find a way out

60
00:05:38.865 --> 00:05:40.995
and starved to death.

61
00:05:40.995 --> 00:05:43.214
- (chuckles) Well, everyone
has their own theory


62
00:05:43.214 --> 00:05:46.715
and trust me, there are millions of them.

63
00:05:46.715 --> 00:05:50.215
So if you guys
will follow me down here...

64
00:05:56.157 --> 00:05:58.907
(birds chirping)

65
00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:22.673
- Oh good.

66
00:06:22.673 --> 00:06:23.506
Hey, you're back.

67
00:06:23.506 --> 00:06:25.365
I wanted to go over some
last minute details with you


68
00:06:25.365 --> 00:06:27.229
before I jet out.

69
00:06:27.229 --> 00:06:28.473
How was the tour?

70
00:06:28.473 --> 00:06:29.877
- It was fine.

71
00:06:29.877 --> 00:06:31.775
- You sure? You look stressed.

72
00:06:31.775 --> 00:06:33.264
- No, no, I'm just tired.

73
00:06:33.264 --> 00:06:36.114
- Well, don't be. I need
you to be awake and ready.


74
00:06:36.114 --> 00:06:36.983
Do you hear me?

75
00:06:36.983 --> 00:06:38.566
- Yes.

76
00:06:38.566 --> 00:06:41.008
Of course. I'm all ears.

77
00:06:41.008 --> 00:06:41.841
- All right.

78
00:06:41.841 --> 00:06:43.040
So I need you to make sure

79
00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:44.847
that the maids finish up with the rooms

80
00:06:44.847 --> 00:06:47.292
and the new girl, she's been kinda slow.

81
00:06:47.292 --> 00:06:49.328
And the bartender, he
keeps forgetting to lock up


82
00:06:49.328 --> 00:06:51.487
the liquor cabinet, all right?

83
00:06:51.487 --> 00:06:53.855
And after the bar and restaurant closes,

84
00:06:53.855 --> 00:06:55.128
take all the money that we made

85
00:06:55.128 --> 00:06:57.596
including the receipts from the registers.

86
00:06:57.596 --> 00:06:59.855
I want you to put them
over here in the safe


87
00:06:59.855 --> 00:07:02.460
and I'll leave the combination
right here on my desk.


88
00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:04.321
And I think you know the rest.

89
00:07:04.321 --> 00:07:05.154
Sounds good?

90
00:07:05.154 --> 00:07:06.769
- Yes, I got this.

91
00:07:06.769 --> 00:07:08.354
- Uh, you sure?

92
00:07:08.354 --> 00:07:09.831
- Yes. Go on, get outta here.

93
00:07:09.831 --> 00:07:11.359
- Hey, don't need to
tell me twice. (laughing)


94
00:07:11.359 --> 00:07:13.330
(gentle guitar music)

95
00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:14.163
Eh.

96
00:07:19.837 --> 00:07:21.438
Hey, thanks again for this.

97
00:07:21.438 --> 00:07:22.804
You know, I don't mean to
put all this work on you


98
00:07:22.804 --> 00:07:25.410
last minute but I need
to get outta this place.


99
00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:28.064
- Ah, it's totally fine
as long as I get paid.


100
00:07:28.064 --> 00:07:29.124
- Ah, you will.

101
00:07:29.124 --> 00:07:30.276
Don't worry.

102
00:07:30.276 --> 00:07:32.540
Hey, your dad never worried about payment.

103
00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:35.060
- [Valerie] Uh, well,
he was also a cheap guy.


104
00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:36.104
- He was a great guy.

105
00:07:36.104 --> 00:07:37.541
He was the best.

106
00:07:37.541 --> 00:07:40.301
I could tell you stories
about him all day long.


107
00:07:40.301 --> 00:07:41.218
- So can I.

108
00:07:42.976 --> 00:07:44.097
- Hey, listen, 
I know this is

109
00:07:44.097 --> 00:07:45.458
your last year here and everything,

110
00:07:45.458 --> 00:07:47.787
but you know, if you change your mind

111
00:07:47.787 --> 00:07:49.062
and you wanna stay here,

112
00:07:49.062 --> 00:07:50.627
there's always a place for you, right?

113
00:07:50.627 --> 00:07:54.138
Could always use a Faust on my team.

114
00:07:54.138 --> 00:07:55.001
- Thank you.

115
00:07:55.001 --> 00:07:56.475
I really appreciate that.

116
00:07:56.475 --> 00:07:58.167
And I love it
here, you know, I do.

117
00:07:58.167 --> 00:08:02.000
It's just it's time for
some change, you know.


118
00:08:03.295 --> 00:08:07.674
I was basically born
here so how sad's that?


119
00:08:07.674 --> 00:08:08.757
No offense.

120
00:08:08.757 --> 00:08:10.283
- Yeah, none taken, sweetheart.

121
00:08:10.283 --> 00:08:11.854
You got to have control of your life.

122
00:08:11.854 --> 00:08:13.900
I want you to remember that, okay?

123
00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:14.900
Gimme a hug.

124
00:08:16.614 --> 00:08:18.353
Have a good one and be safe.

125
00:08:18.353 --> 00:08:19.346
- Uh, you too.

126
00:08:19.346 --> 00:08:20.705
Enjoy your days off.

127
00:08:20.705 --> 00:08:21.713
- I will.

128
00:08:21.713 --> 00:08:23.313
And listen, don't forget what I said.

129
00:08:23.313 --> 00:08:24.668
It's super important, okay?

130
00:08:24.668 --> 00:08:27.585
And don't slack off
and if you get tired,

131
00:08:27.585 --> 00:08:29.589
make coffee or something, all right?

132
00:08:29.589 --> 00:08:30.422
Yeah.

133
00:08:36.835 --> 00:08:38.519
You might need these.

134
00:08:38.519 --> 00:08:39.352
(keys jangling)

135
00:08:39.352 --> 00:08:40.185
Yeah.

136
00:08:46.975 --> 00:08:47.936
- Why do you think it's okay

137
00:08:47.936 --> 00:08:50.665
to fucking kill a guy who
makes such delicious salads?


138
00:08:50.665 --> 00:08:51.940
- All right.

139
00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:52.773
Okay.

140
00:08:54.084 --> 00:08:57.502
I'm just saying that he had good reason

141
00:08:57.502 --> 00:09:00.373
and it wasn't out of spite or vengeful.

142
00:09:00.373 --> 00:09:02.245
It was for the good of the Commonwealth.

143
00:09:02.245 --> 00:09:03.456
- It doesn't matter about your reasons

144
00:09:03.456 --> 00:09:04.605
or vengeance or spite.

145
00:09:04.605 --> 00:09:06.995
Fuck, man, he is the ruler, okay.

146
00:09:06.995 --> 00:09:08.053
And everybody loved him.

147
00:09:08.053 --> 00:09:10.413
So you think it's okay

148
00:09:10.413 --> 00:09:12.613
to pretend you know what's
gonna happen in the future


149
00:09:12.613 --> 00:09:14.544
to justify killing him.

150
00:09:14.544 --> 00:09:17.542
- No, I'm just sayin', I
think he got a bad rap.


151
00:09:17.542 --> 00:09:20.754
And if you really look at it,
he might've been in the right.


152
00:09:20.754 --> 00:09:23.754
- Fuck you. That's warp, dish bitch.

153
00:09:24.762 --> 00:09:25.845
- It's Daemon.

154
00:09:25.845 --> 00:09:27.692
- (chuckles) Yeah sure it is.

155
00:09:27.692 --> 00:09:29.791
(Daemon sighs)

156
00:09:29.791 --> 00:09:31.239
(switch clicks)

157
00:09:31.239 --> 00:09:32.072
(fist thuds)

158
00:09:32.072 --> 00:09:34.590
Not this fucking shit again.

159
00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:35.423
- [Daemon] Want me
to go check it out?

160
00:09:35.423 --> 00:09:37.195
- [Lucas] No, no, fuck, dumb dumb.

161
00:09:37.195 --> 00:09:38.321
Your hands are fucking wet.

162
00:09:38.321 --> 00:09:39.154
I got this.

163
00:09:39.154 --> 00:09:39.987
Plus how many times I gotta tell you,

164
00:09:39.987 --> 00:09:41.255
I'm the only one who can do this.

165
00:09:41.255 --> 00:09:43.107
- Right, right.

166
00:09:43.107 --> 00:09:46.479
(switch clicking)

167
00:09:46.479 --> 00:09:47.479
Success!

168
00:09:47.479 --> 00:09:51.268
- God! Fucking damn this
fucking old piece of shit.


169
00:09:51.268 --> 00:09:53.133
Man, everything's fucking
falling apart in here.


170
00:09:53.133 --> 00:09:54.116
Man, I'm telling you,

171
00:09:54.116 --> 00:09:55.847
I'm so glad we're almost
outta here for a month


172
00:09:55.847 --> 00:09:58.844
so they can spend some
time fixing this place up.


173
00:09:58.844 --> 00:10:00.439
Fucking the lights in the cave.

174
00:10:00.439 --> 00:10:02.817
Everything's fucking deteriorating.

175
00:10:02.817 --> 00:10:04.719
- [Daemon] Lights in the
cave, what about 'em?


176
00:10:04.719 --> 00:10:05.983
- What? You didn't hear about this?

177
00:10:05.983 --> 00:10:07.889
The fucking lights in
the cave keep going out.


178
00:10:07.889 --> 00:10:10.719
Supervisor insists we work on
the reliable fucking lights


179
00:10:10.719 --> 00:10:12.297
and they keep going out.

180
00:10:12.297 --> 00:10:14.029
Shit, man, Val had a tour down there

181
00:10:14.029 --> 00:10:15.323
tripping dick and a half because of it.

182
00:10:15.323 --> 00:10:17.488
How do you not
hear this shit, dish bitch?

183
00:10:17.488 --> 00:10:19.648
- Uh, I don't know.

184
00:10:19.648 --> 00:10:20.881
Just haven't heard I guess.

185
00:10:20.881 --> 00:10:22.166
- They're trying to
sue us because of that.


186
00:10:22.166 --> 00:10:23.025
Do you know that?

187
00:10:23.025 --> 00:10:24.273
I wish they fucking did.

188
00:10:24.273 --> 00:10:26.564
Get outta here, get a new fucking job.

189
00:10:26.564 --> 00:10:29.082
- Ooh, almost off the clock.

190
00:10:29.082 --> 00:10:30.038
Thank God.

191
00:10:30.038 --> 00:10:31.481
- Fucking Coop.

192
00:10:31.481 --> 00:10:32.992
- Yeah I almost
dropped a ton of dishes

193
00:10:32.992 --> 00:10:34.413
during that last blackout.

194
00:10:34.413 --> 00:10:35.612
- [Lucas] (chuckles) I think that drink

195
00:10:35.612 --> 00:10:38.172
is why you fucking almost
dropped them dishes.


196
00:10:38.172 --> 00:10:39.756
- Yeah. What do you think?

197
00:10:39.756 --> 00:10:42.508
Is it time to
do some shots or what?

198
00:10:42.508 --> 00:10:43.618
- Well, that depends.

199
00:10:43.618 --> 00:10:46.854
Done with all your dishes,
dish bitch? (chuckles)


200
00:10:46.854 --> 00:10:47.687
- It's cool.

201
00:10:47.687 --> 00:10:50.854
You got your sidekick saying that too.

202
00:10:52.024 --> 00:10:54.417
- (chuckles) Well, it's fucking funny.

203
00:10:54.417 --> 00:10:56.584
- Yeah. It's pretty funny.

204
00:10:58.338 --> 00:11:01.120
So we still gonna hang
out after this or what?


205
00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:01.953
(door thudding)

206
00:11:01.953 --> 00:11:03.560
- Get back to work, you savages!

207
00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:04.906
- [Lucas] Goddamn it, Val.

208
00:11:04.906 --> 00:11:06.953
- (chuckles) So I don't
know about you guys,


209
00:11:06.953 --> 00:11:08.965
but I am ready for a shot.

210
00:11:08.965 --> 00:11:11.216
- Yeah, that's what I was just saying.

211
00:11:11.216 --> 00:11:12.699
Hey, are we still on for tonight?

212
00:11:12.699 --> 00:11:13.784
- Of course.

213
00:11:13.784 --> 00:11:16.733
We're going to be loud,
dumb, and crazy tonight.


214
00:11:16.733 --> 00:11:17.808
- (chuckles) Amen to that.

215
00:11:17.808 --> 00:11:19.467
- But first,
(hands clap)


216
00:11:19.467 --> 00:11:20.552
we have to make
sure our jobs are done.

217
00:11:20.552 --> 00:11:23.300
So, Lucas, clean up your station.

218
00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:26.113
Cooper, make sure the
liquor cabinet is locked.


219
00:11:26.113 --> 00:11:26.947
- [Lucas] I already cleaned.

220
00:11:26.947 --> 00:11:28.723
- And I can't pregame if I
lock up the liquor cabinet.


221
00:11:28.723 --> 00:11:29.556
- I don't wanna hear

222
00:11:29.556 --> 00:11:30.389
any of your complaining.
(hands clap)


223
00:11:30.389 --> 00:11:32.306
I will be in my office.

224
00:11:34.161 --> 00:11:37.240
- [Cooper] Man, kinda
wish she's not leaving.


225
00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:38.472
- [Lucas] I don't really give a damn

226
00:11:38.472 --> 00:11:40.738
as long as they don't put
that dick Justin in charge.


227
00:11:40.738 --> 00:11:43.569
- [Cooper] Yeah. Fuck Justin.

228
00:11:43.569 --> 00:11:46.569
(people chattering)

229
00:12:00.028 --> 00:12:03.111
(people chattering)

230
00:12:34.629 --> 00:12:37.379
(water dripping)

231
00:12:44.619 --> 00:12:49.619
(somber music)
(birds chirping)


232
00:13:05.997 --> 00:13:08.080
- Let's get going, kiddo.

233
00:13:09.765 --> 00:13:11.765
(sighs)

234
00:13:17.802 --> 00:13:20.302
Hey, I have something for you.

235
00:13:22.005 --> 00:13:22.987
I was gonna wait
to give this to you

236
00:13:22.987 --> 00:13:25.570
but now seems like a good time.

237
00:13:26.685 --> 00:13:28.235
It was your mother's.

238
00:13:28.235 --> 00:13:30.696
She would've wanted you to have it.

239
00:13:30.696 --> 00:13:32.556
It's not really my style.

240
00:13:32.556 --> 00:13:33.556
- Thank you.

241
00:13:35.195 --> 00:13:36.285
- She'll always be here with us.

242
00:13:36.285 --> 00:13:37.637
You know that, right?

243
00:13:37.637 --> 00:13:40.527
- [Valerie] Yeah, I know.

244
00:13:40.527 --> 00:13:44.917
- And we'll always be here
for each other, right?


245
00:13:44.917 --> 00:13:47.243
Unless, you put me
in a home or something.

246
00:13:47.243 --> 00:13:48.780
(Valerie chuckles)

247
00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:51.443
Wait, you're not gonna
put me in a home are ya?


248
00:13:51.443 --> 00:13:53.819
- It depends I guess.

249
00:13:53.819 --> 00:13:55.413
- You guess?

250
00:13:55.413 --> 00:13:56.856
All right

251
00:13:56.856 --> 00:13:57.732
You getting hungry?

252
00:13:57.732 --> 00:13:58.652
- Yes.

253
00:13:58.652 --> 00:14:01.191
- You wanna go get something to eat?

254
00:14:01.191 --> 00:14:03.024
All right, you choose.

255
00:14:58.905 --> 00:15:00.405
- [Diane] Oh fuck.

256
00:15:01.270 --> 00:15:02.782
- Diane.

257
00:15:02.782 --> 00:15:04.823
- Hey, Val. How was your last tour?

258
00:15:04.823 --> 00:15:06.897
- Same as always.

259
00:15:06.897 --> 00:15:08.366
- [Diane] Still excited to leave?

260
00:15:08.366 --> 00:15:09.970
- More than ever.

261
00:15:09.970 --> 00:15:12.267
Are you doing your job?

262
00:15:12.267 --> 00:15:14.337
- (chuckles) Yes, 
I'm almost done.

263
00:15:14.337 --> 00:15:18.322
I just came to
get some cleaner for Gwen.

264
00:15:18.322 --> 00:15:20.101
- Everything okay?

265
00:15:20.101 --> 00:15:21.335
- Yeah. I'm sorry.

266
00:15:21.335 --> 00:15:23.160
I'm just really tired.

267
00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:24.785
I've been here since eight.

268
00:15:24.785 --> 00:15:25.766
Oh, you know how it is?

269
00:15:25.766 --> 00:15:28.740
I shouldn't be telling you. (chuckles)

270
00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:29.809
- Are you sure?

271
00:15:29.809 --> 00:15:31.324
How's Steven?

272
00:15:31.324 --> 00:15:33.991
- He left already. He had to go.

273
00:15:34.921 --> 00:15:36.465
- Diane, tell me what's wrong.

274
00:15:36.465 --> 00:15:40.165
You know, I have a kind
of sense for this stuff.


275
00:15:40.165 --> 00:15:42.783
- It's nothing really.

276
00:15:42.783 --> 00:15:43.783
It's stupid.

277
00:15:44.866 --> 00:15:45.699
- Tell me.

278
00:15:46.582 --> 00:15:50.521
- Before he left, 
I couldn't find my phone

279
00:15:50.521 --> 00:15:52.405
so I borrowed his

280
00:15:52.405 --> 00:15:54.155
and a text popped up.

281
00:15:55.255 --> 00:15:56.255
- From whom?

282
00:15:57.517 --> 00:15:58.769
- Gwen.

283
00:15:58.769 --> 00:16:00.599
- The new maid Gwen?

284
00:16:00.599 --> 00:16:01.432
- Yes.

285
00:16:02.849 --> 00:16:04.558
- Are you sure it was her?

286
00:16:04.558 --> 00:16:06.832
It had her name. It said, Gwen.

287
00:16:06.832 --> 00:16:08.152
Are you sure it was her?

288
00:16:08.152 --> 00:16:09.477
- Yes.

289
00:16:09.477 --> 00:16:12.012
And it said, "Thanks for last night"

290
00:16:12.012 --> 00:16:14.177
with a stupid smiley face.

291
00:16:14.177 --> 00:16:15.358
Fucking whore.

292
00:16:15.358 --> 00:16:18.543
- (chuckles) That can
mean anything, you know?


293
00:16:18.543 --> 00:16:20.177
Have you talked to him about it?

294
00:16:20.177 --> 00:16:21.783
- No.

295
00:16:21.783 --> 00:16:23.493
I don't wanna do that.

296
00:16:23.493 --> 00:16:25.533
I don't know how to approach it.

297
00:16:25.533 --> 00:16:28.040
I'll just speak without
thinking of what I'm gonna say.


298
00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:29.722
And I'll just insinuate

299
00:16:29.722 --> 00:16:31.160
and it'll just make everything worse.

300
00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:32.493
I can't do that.

301
00:16:33.605 --> 00:16:36.098
- I know something that can help you.

302
00:16:36.098 --> 00:16:36.931
- What?

303
00:16:38.213 --> 00:16:40.303
- The going away party tonight.

304
00:16:40.303 --> 00:16:41.503
Uh... (chuckles)

305
00:16:41.503 --> 00:16:43.423
- No, I can't do a party, Val.

306
00:16:43.423 --> 00:16:45.279
- A few of us
are staying in a cabin.

307
00:16:45.279 --> 00:16:47.678
We're gonna have some drinks.

308
00:16:47.678 --> 00:16:49.132
It'll be fun.

309
00:16:49.132 --> 00:16:50.882
I mean, you need fun.

310
00:16:51.993 --> 00:16:54.649
Like when was the
last time you had fun?

311
00:16:54.649 --> 00:16:55.942
- What about this place?

312
00:16:55.942 --> 00:16:58.243
We still have things to
do before the renovation.


313
00:16:58.243 --> 00:17:01.908
- That is why we are
spending tomorrow doing it.


314
00:17:01.908 --> 00:17:02.773
- I don't know, I feel like

315
00:17:02.773 --> 00:17:05.231
we should just get everything over with.

316
00:17:05.231 --> 00:17:06.896
- It's my going away party

317
00:17:06.896 --> 00:17:10.477
and I refuse to celebrate without you.

318
00:17:10.477 --> 00:17:14.140
- (sighs) Will Gwen be there?

319
00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:15.390
- I don't know.

320
00:17:17.354 --> 00:17:18.903
- Fine. (sighs)

321
00:17:18.903 --> 00:17:21.228
I guess I could
use a drink or two.

322
00:17:21.228 --> 00:17:22.802
Can I share a bed with you

323
00:17:22.802 --> 00:17:25.313
or are you gonna be
snuggling the dishwasher?


324
00:17:25.313 --> 00:17:28.654
- (chuckles) We will see
where the night takes us.


325
00:17:28.654 --> 00:17:30.148
(Diane laughing)

326
00:17:30.148 --> 00:17:32.002
Now, do you wanna get this
party started off right


327
00:17:32.002 --> 00:17:34.502
with a glass of cheap whiskey?

328
00:17:35.492 --> 00:17:36.873
- [Cooper] "Poseidon Adventure".

329
00:17:36.873 --> 00:17:39.123
Gene Hackman. It was a classic.

330
00:17:39.123 --> 00:17:40.648
(fingers snap)
- Leslie Nielsen.


331
00:17:40.648 --> 00:17:41.563
- Yes.

332
00:17:41.563 --> 00:17:42.940
(Lucas chuckling)

333
00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:43.928
- Who?

334
00:17:43.928 --> 00:17:45.363
- "Naked Gun".

335
00:17:45.363 --> 00:17:47.582
- "Don't call me Shirley".

336
00:17:47.582 --> 00:17:51.082
- Uh... Yeah, I don't
see a lot of movies.

337
00:17:52.131 --> 00:17:52.964
- You see?

338
00:17:52.964 --> 00:17:53.797
Fuck, man.

339
00:17:53.797 --> 00:17:55.215
This is what's wrong with this country.

340
00:17:55.215 --> 00:17:57.699
Too busy focused on stupid shit.

341
00:17:57.699 --> 00:17:59.655
- Well, you guys are talking about movies.

342
00:17:59.655 --> 00:18:00.559
- Great movies.

343
00:18:00.559 --> 00:18:02.076
- Fucking classics.

344
00:18:02.076 --> 00:18:04.471
- Yeah, according to you two degenerates.

345
00:18:04.471 --> 00:18:06.758
- If being a degenerate
means watching great movies,


346
00:18:06.758 --> 00:18:07.993
guilty as charged.

347
00:18:07.993 --> 00:18:09.033
- Yes.

348
00:18:09.033 --> 00:18:10.435
- I don't see you guys working.

349
00:18:10.435 --> 00:18:12.405
- Holy shit, Val!
(Valerie laughing)


350
00:18:12.405 --> 00:18:14.216
- You big baby.

351
00:18:14.216 --> 00:18:15.602
- Are we done?

352
00:18:15.602 --> 00:18:16.709
- We are done.

353
00:18:16.709 --> 00:18:17.542
- Yes!

354
00:18:17.542 --> 00:18:18.375
- Woo!

355
00:18:18.375 --> 00:18:21.813
- Except, is the liquor locked up, Cooper?

356
00:18:21.813 --> 00:18:22.646
- One sec.

357
00:18:24.669 --> 00:18:27.623
(Lucas slurping)
- So are we good to go?


358
00:18:27.623 --> 00:18:28.456
- Almost.

359
00:18:28.456 --> 00:18:30.609
We're waiting for Diane and the new girl.

360
00:18:30.609 --> 00:18:32.455
- Is that Gwen?

361
00:18:32.455 --> 00:18:36.590
(fingers snap)
Fuck, dude, super hot.


362
00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:38.314
And I think she's single.

363
00:18:38.314 --> 00:18:39.467
She's cute.
- Cooper, can you please


364
00:18:39.467 --> 00:18:41.067
get Gwen on the walkie talkie

365
00:18:41.067 --> 00:18:42.667
and ask how long she'll be?

366
00:18:42.667 --> 00:18:44.720
- Yeah, how long until Gwen's here?

367
00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:46.566
- Anything else you want?

368
00:18:46.566 --> 00:18:47.916
- That is it, I swear.

369
00:18:47.916 --> 00:18:49.499
- Thank you.
- Okay.


370
00:18:55.136 --> 00:18:56.792
- Hey, Gwen, Gwen, come on back now.

371
00:18:56.792 --> 00:18:57.875
You got this?

372
00:19:00.131 --> 00:19:01.760
Gwen, you got a copy?

373
00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:03.146
Gwen, Gwen. Hey, Gwen.
(vacuum humming)


374
00:19:03.146 --> 00:19:04.349
(lively music)

375
00:19:04.349 --> 00:19:05.266
Gwen, Gwen.

376
00:19:06.170 --> 00:19:07.090
How you doing?

377
00:19:07.090 --> 00:19:09.460
Are you there? Got a copy?

378
00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:10.293
Gwen.

379
00:19:11.698 --> 00:19:14.830
- Don't you think she's hot? (giggling)

380
00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:15.663
She is.

381
00:19:15.663 --> 00:19:16.496
- No, stop.

382
00:19:16.496 --> 00:19:18.329
- Come on.
- You stop.


383
00:19:18.329 --> 00:19:19.412
- Nothin'.

384
00:19:19.412 --> 00:19:20.438
- Super hot, right?

385
00:19:20.438 --> 00:19:21.570
- [Cooper] Who we talking about? Gwen?

386
00:19:21.570 --> 00:19:22.403
- Yes!

387
00:19:22.403 --> 00:19:23.236
See.

388
00:19:23.236 --> 00:19:24.069
- So hot.
- Told you.


389
00:19:24.069 --> 00:19:25.394
- We get it.

390
00:19:25.394 --> 00:19:26.639
That's workplace harassment.

391
00:19:26.639 --> 00:19:28.512
Be glad today is my last day.

392
00:19:28.512 --> 00:19:29.938
- Ah! And you love me.

393
00:19:29.938 --> 00:19:31.542
- And I love you.

394
00:19:31.542 --> 00:19:32.687
- All right, cheers.

395
00:19:32.687 --> 00:19:34.023
Let's fucking get this party started.

396
00:19:34.023 --> 00:19:34.856
- Cheers!
- Woo!


397
00:19:34.856 --> 00:19:36.982
- (laughing) Up.

398
00:19:36.982 --> 00:19:38.315
I have to make sure everything's in order

399
00:19:38.315 --> 00:19:40.565
before I get too fucked up.

400
00:19:42.224 --> 00:19:43.353
- [Lucas And Cooper] Cheers.

401
00:19:43.353 --> 00:19:44.853
- [Daemon] Cheers.

402
00:19:46.090 --> 00:19:48.840
(vacuum humming)

403
00:20:11.156 --> 00:20:11.989
- Gwen.

404
00:20:13.798 --> 00:20:14.631
Gwen!

405
00:20:16.738 --> 00:20:17.571
Gwen!

406
00:20:17.571 --> 00:20:19.598
- Oh finally, did you
get the cleaning stuff?


407
00:20:19.598 --> 00:20:22.099
Oh, hey, hey.
(both chuckling)


408
00:20:22.099 --> 00:20:23.459
I'm almost finished up here.

409
00:20:23.459 --> 00:20:24.883
So how's your last day?

410
00:20:24.883 --> 00:20:26.273
- Uh, it's all right.

411
00:20:26.273 --> 00:20:27.977
We're about to head over to the cabin.

412
00:20:27.977 --> 00:20:28.997
You're gonna come?

413
00:20:28.997 --> 00:20:30.098
- [Gwen] Yeah. Yeah.

414
00:20:30.098 --> 00:20:32.629
Is everybody gonna be there?

415
00:20:32.629 --> 00:20:34.603
- Yeah. Including Diane.

416
00:20:34.603 --> 00:20:38.186
So don't be a bitch
and keep your distance.


417
00:20:39.189 --> 00:20:41.829
- Why? Did she
finally admit she hates me?

418
00:20:41.829 --> 00:20:42.888
- Kind of.

419
00:20:42.888 --> 00:20:44.955
- Well, thanks for your honesty.

420
00:20:44.955 --> 00:20:46.124
(Valerie laughing)

421
00:20:46.124 --> 00:20:48.492
- Look, yeah, you
don't have to come if-

422
00:20:48.492 --> 00:20:49.928
- Oh no no. I wanna go.

423
00:20:49.928 --> 00:20:52.927
I just don't want Diane
to make it all weird.


424
00:20:52.927 --> 00:20:55.528
She told me all these fucking
stories about this room.


425
00:20:55.528 --> 00:20:57.461
And now she's talking about her husband-

426
00:20:57.461 --> 00:20:58.666
- You can do whatever you want.

427
00:20:58.666 --> 00:21:01.611
I mean, you can
stay here and finish up

428
00:21:01.611 --> 00:21:03.165
and that's fine.

429
00:21:03.165 --> 00:21:05.659
Or you can come with us,

430
00:21:05.659 --> 00:21:07.656
take a break, and finish in the morning

431
00:21:07.656 --> 00:21:09.048
and that's fine too.

432
00:21:09.048 --> 00:21:09.943
- Yeah.
- Okay.


433
00:21:09.943 --> 00:21:10.860
- Let's go.

434
00:21:14.172 --> 00:21:17.172
(lively rock music)

435
00:21:50.207 --> 00:21:52.540
- Time to drink, dish bitch.

436
00:21:53.804 --> 00:21:57.314
- [All] Dish bitch,
dish bitch, dish bitch,


437
00:21:57.314 --> 00:22:00.012
dish bitch, dish bitch, dish bitch,

438
00:22:00.012 --> 00:22:03.803
dish bitch, dish bitch, dish bitch, woo!

439
00:22:03.803 --> 00:22:04.636
- Go, boy.

440
00:22:05.948 --> 00:22:09.348
- I never liked
ice skating as a kid,

441
00:22:09.348 --> 00:22:12.348
but now it is seriously so much fun.

442
00:22:13.983 --> 00:22:16.579
- You're still a fucking kid.

443
00:22:16.579 --> 00:22:18.163
- I hate ice skating.

444
00:22:18.163 --> 00:22:19.833
- That means you've never tried it.

445
00:22:19.833 --> 00:22:21.128
- No, I have tried it.

446
00:22:21.128 --> 00:22:23.118
I just could never
get the hang of it.

447
00:22:23.118 --> 00:22:26.973
- I was the ice skating
queen when I was younger.


448
00:22:26.973 --> 00:22:28.246
- Is that right?

449
00:22:28.246 --> 00:22:29.623
- Yes, sir.

450
00:22:29.623 --> 00:22:33.199
- I feel like we have more
people on staff, don't we?


451
00:22:33.199 --> 00:22:34.582
Feels so small.

452
00:22:34.582 --> 00:22:36.948
- Most of the people already left.

453
00:22:36.948 --> 00:22:38.443
- Yeah, where the fuck's Patty?

454
00:22:38.443 --> 00:22:39.988
- Yeah. I love that guy.

455
00:22:39.988 --> 00:22:40.990
- Yeah.
(bottles clinking)


456
00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:42.569
- He had to go home to Janet.

457
00:22:42.569 --> 00:22:43.950
- [Daemon] Who's Janet?

458
00:22:43.950 --> 00:22:44.783
- His wife.

459
00:22:44.783 --> 00:22:47.129
- (scoffs) Lame.

460
00:22:47.129 --> 00:22:49.019
- What about Leon?

461
00:22:49.019 --> 00:22:49.966
He never goes anywhere.

462
00:22:49.966 --> 00:22:50.850
I mean, what's he doing?

463
00:22:50.850 --> 00:22:52.165
- Who the fuck is Leon?

464
00:22:52.165 --> 00:22:54.578
- The groundskeeper.

465
00:22:54.578 --> 00:22:55.618
He's creepy.

466
00:22:55.618 --> 00:22:58.519
- Oh yeah, I
know who we're talking about.

467
00:22:58.519 --> 00:23:01.969
Didn't he like go to jail or something?

468
00:23:01.969 --> 00:23:04.112
- That was forever ago.

469
00:23:04.112 --> 00:23:06.048
My aunt told me the story.

470
00:23:06.048 --> 00:23:08.215
He was a teenager I think.

471
00:23:09.333 --> 00:23:11.168
She said it was self-defense.

472
00:23:11.168 --> 00:23:12.878
- Oh shit, wait.

473
00:23:12.878 --> 00:23:14.380
He killed a guy?

474
00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:16.189
- I'm not a hundred percent sure.

475
00:23:16.189 --> 00:23:17.371
This is just what my aunt said.

476
00:23:17.371 --> 00:23:18.954
- Come on, tell us.

477
00:23:21.863 --> 00:23:24.169
- I don't know anything else.

478
00:23:24.169 --> 00:23:27.752
All I know is he was
walking home one night


479
00:23:29.229 --> 00:23:31.896
and suddenly this man jumps him.

480
00:23:33.437 --> 00:23:35.906
So he takes out a knife.

481
00:23:35.906 --> 00:23:37.552
He stabs the guy.

482
00:23:37.552 --> 00:23:40.352
- Wait, the guy jumped
him, so he killed him?


483
00:23:40.352 --> 00:23:43.163
- Like I said, I'm not
a hundred percent sure.


484
00:23:43.163 --> 00:23:44.917
- [Lucas] Then why'd he go to jail

485
00:23:44.917 --> 00:23:46.032
if the other guy jumped him?

486
00:23:46.032 --> 00:23:48.912
- Because there was no
evidence of him being jumped.


487
00:23:48.912 --> 00:23:51.677
There was just a dead body.

488
00:23:51.677 --> 00:23:53.154
- Yikes!

489
00:23:53.154 --> 00:23:55.688
Yo, we should hang out with that guy.

490
00:23:55.688 --> 00:23:56.933
- I don't know if I wanna
stay in the same cabin


491
00:23:56.933 --> 00:23:58.163
as a convicted killer.

492
00:23:58.163 --> 00:23:59.739
- It was self-defense.

493
00:23:59.739 --> 00:24:00.572
- We don't know that.

494
00:24:00.572 --> 00:24:02.603
Diane said she wasn't a hundred percent.

495
00:24:02.603 --> 00:24:03.436
- I'm not.

496
00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:12.357
- All in favor of hanging
out with the groundskeeper.


497
00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:21.043
That settles it.

498
00:24:21.043 --> 00:24:22.431
I'll go get him.

499
00:24:22.431 --> 00:24:23.972
- Do you know where he lives?

500
00:24:23.972 --> 00:24:25.722
- I'll figure it out.

501
00:24:27.082 --> 00:24:32.082
(gentle guitar music)
(insects chirping)


502
00:24:42.756 --> 00:24:45.506
(light knocking)

503
00:24:47.746 --> 00:24:48.579
Hey.

504
00:24:50.245 --> 00:24:53.160
(door rattling)

505
00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:54.950
- We know each other?

506
00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:56.140
- Not really.

507
00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:58.807
Um... I, I work up at the lodge.

508
00:24:59.727 --> 00:25:01.471
I'm the new dishwasher.

509
00:25:01.471 --> 00:25:02.818
I'm Daemon.

510
00:25:02.818 --> 00:25:04.197
- What do you need?

511
00:25:04.197 --> 00:25:07.739
- Oh, well, you know Valerie and Diane?

512
00:25:07.739 --> 00:25:10.018
Well, Val and Diane and some of us

513
00:25:10.018 --> 00:25:12.261
we're hanging out up there
having a little party.


514
00:25:12.261 --> 00:25:14.279
Thought maybe you wanna come.

515
00:25:14.279 --> 00:25:16.304
- Really? A party.

516
00:25:16.304 --> 00:25:17.137
- Yeah.

517
00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:22.936
- I don't really party anymore, man.

518
00:25:22.936 --> 00:25:23.853
- Oh, okay.

519
00:25:26.421 --> 00:25:27.566
(door creaking)

520
00:25:27.566 --> 00:25:28.611
- You know what, fuck it.

521
00:25:28.611 --> 00:25:29.848
I'll get ready.

522
00:25:29.848 --> 00:25:31.167
- [Daemon] Cool.

523
00:25:31.167 --> 00:25:32.834
- You wanna come in?

524
00:25:34.084 --> 00:25:34.917
- Sure.

525
00:25:44.736 --> 00:25:45.569
- Sorry, if the life's
(low suspenseful music)


526
00:25:45.569 --> 00:25:46.661
kinda sucked out of the place.

527
00:25:46.661 --> 00:25:48.917
I was just off to bed.

528
00:25:48.917 --> 00:25:51.597
- Oh, I hope I'm not bothering you.

529
00:25:51.597 --> 00:25:52.435
- No, man, not at all.
(tense rock music)


530
00:25:52.435 --> 00:25:53.821
I don't get asked
to come out very much

531
00:25:53.821 --> 00:25:56.821
so can I get you something to drink?

532
00:25:57.668 --> 00:25:58.869
- Oh no. That's cool.

533
00:25:58.869 --> 00:26:01.223
We got a lot
back up at the cabin.

534
00:26:01.223 --> 00:26:04.066
- Cool, man. Well, 
I won't be long.

535
00:26:04.066 --> 00:26:05.899
Make yourself at home.

536
00:26:10.029 --> 00:26:12.862
(dark rock music)

537
00:26:50.032 --> 00:26:52.782
(water dripping)

538
00:27:13.494 --> 00:27:16.056
(door clattering)

539
00:27:16.056 --> 00:27:17.746
- Everything okay over there?

540
00:27:17.746 --> 00:27:20.378
- Yeah. You had a leaky faucet,

541
00:27:20.378 --> 00:27:23.263
but it's cool, I fixed it.

542
00:27:23.263 --> 00:27:24.848
- Thanks, man.

543
00:27:24.848 --> 00:27:27.307
- [Daemon] No problem.

544
00:27:27.307 --> 00:27:28.140
- How did you do that?

545
00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:29.280
I've been messing with this thing forever

546
00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:31.160
to get it to stop leaking.

547
00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:33.627
- Oh well, I'm a handy guy.

548
00:27:33.627 --> 00:27:35.955
Plus my dad was always a
stickler for things like that


549
00:27:35.955 --> 00:27:37.372
around the house.

550
00:27:38.888 --> 00:27:40.055
- Fair enough.

551
00:27:41.234 --> 00:27:43.020
Well, I'm ready.

552
00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:44.265
How'd you get over here?

553
00:27:44.265 --> 00:27:45.850
- I walked.

554
00:27:45.850 --> 00:27:47.960
- You want a ride?

555
00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:48.887
- Sure.

556
00:27:48.887 --> 00:27:51.259
- All right, let's go.

557
00:27:51.259 --> 00:27:54.176
(insects chirping)

558
00:27:56.439 --> 00:27:57.359
- [Cooper] I'm telling you, dude.

559
00:27:57.359 --> 00:27:58.764
Golf is not a fucking sport.

560
00:27:58.764 --> 00:27:59.730
- Yes, it is a sport.

561
00:27:59.730 --> 00:28:00.563
- How is it a sport?

562
00:28:00.563 --> 00:28:02.294
You fucking drive around in a golf cart.

563
00:28:02.294 --> 00:28:03.548
- Yes, but do you sweat?

564
00:28:03.548 --> 00:28:04.381
- No!

565
00:28:04.381 --> 00:28:06.343
Oh, if you're an old fat
guy, maybe you sweat.


566
00:28:06.343 --> 00:28:08.019
- Then it's a
sport for all fat guys.

567
00:28:08.019 --> 00:28:10.108
- Well, they're not, they
don't have team jerseys.


568
00:28:10.108 --> 00:28:11.628
- Of course they fucking do, man.

569
00:28:11.628 --> 00:28:13.794
It's golf. You go on
a team and you golf.

570
00:28:13.794 --> 00:28:14.761
- No.
- It's a sport.


571
00:28:14.761 --> 00:28:15.594
- No! No, no, no, no, no.
- Look at


572
00:28:15.594 --> 00:28:16.758
the Google definition.

573
00:28:16.758 --> 00:28:18.078
- No, you go after work.

574
00:28:18.078 --> 00:28:20.774
You drink beer and smoke cigarettes

575
00:28:20.774 --> 00:28:21.786
and fucking hang out-
- I gotta pee!


576
00:28:21.786 --> 00:28:22.744
- [Cooper] with your buddies.

577
00:28:22.744 --> 00:28:23.577
But you scratch your balls-
- Gotta pee.


578
00:28:23.577 --> 00:28:25.232
- [Cooper] and walk around
all slow on a course.


579
00:28:25.232 --> 00:28:26.091
- You tell me a sport-
- You take your own


580
00:28:26.091 --> 00:28:27.052
sweet ass time.
where you don't


581
00:28:27.052 --> 00:28:27.885
scratch your balls.

582
00:28:27.885 --> 00:28:28.718
- Tell me... (laughing)
- That's the,


583
00:28:28.718 --> 00:28:30.180
another Google definition.
(Cooper and Valerie laughing)


584
00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:31.426
Right there, sport.

585
00:28:31.426 --> 00:28:32.875
Scratch your balls.

586
00:28:32.875 --> 00:28:33.835
- [Cooper] I disagree.

587
00:28:33.835 --> 00:28:34.668
- [Lucas] Chess?

588
00:28:34.668 --> 00:28:35.609
- [Lucas] Chess is not a sport.

589
00:28:35.609 --> 00:28:37.095
- She's such a slut.

590
00:28:37.095 --> 00:28:38.175
- [Valerie] Diane.

591
00:28:38.175 --> 00:28:39.180
- That was a bit harsh.

592
00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:41.369
- Well, you hear the way she talks?

593
00:28:41.369 --> 00:28:43.684
She's just begging for attention.

594
00:28:43.684 --> 00:28:44.711
You know, if I
ever talked to that way-

595
00:28:44.711 --> 00:28:46.715
- [Valerie] She is nice, okay?

596
00:28:46.715 --> 00:28:47.560
Can we just-

597
00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:49.211
- Not to me.

598
00:28:49.211 --> 00:28:50.330
She's a bitch.

599
00:28:50.330 --> 00:28:51.525
- I think she's cool.

600
00:28:51.525 --> 00:28:54.359
- Yeah. That's 'cause you wanna fuck her.

601
00:28:54.359 --> 00:28:56.463
- No, I wanna fuck you too.

602
00:28:56.463 --> 00:28:58.311
- (scoffs) Aw.

603
00:28:58.311 --> 00:28:59.509
Well thank you.

604
00:28:59.509 --> 00:29:01.584
(door clattering)
(doorbell tinkling)


605
00:29:01.584 --> 00:29:02.417
- We're back.

606
00:29:02.417 --> 00:29:03.267
- There you guys are.

607
00:29:03.267 --> 00:29:04.943
We thought she got lost.

608
00:29:04.943 --> 00:29:06.357
- [Daemon] No, it just
took me a little while


609
00:29:06.357 --> 00:29:07.857
to find his place.

610
00:29:08.716 --> 00:29:10.312
- Well, I know where he lived,

611
00:29:10.312 --> 00:29:12.229
but you never asked me.

612
00:29:16.248 --> 00:29:17.915
- Leon, hi. Welcome.

613
00:29:19.037 --> 00:29:20.157
I'm Valerie.

614
00:29:20.157 --> 00:29:21.893
I don't know if you remember my name.

615
00:29:21.893 --> 00:29:23.432
- Yeah, you're Donald's kid, right?

616
00:29:23.432 --> 00:29:26.159
- Yeah, yes. You knew him?

617
00:29:26.159 --> 00:29:27.712
- I knew of them.

618
00:29:27.712 --> 00:29:29.251
He's a bit of a legend around here.

619
00:29:29.251 --> 00:29:30.465
(Lucas scoffs)

620
00:29:30.465 --> 00:29:31.798
- Well, welcome.

621
00:29:32.850 --> 00:29:33.850
- Thank you.

622
00:29:36.003 --> 00:29:37.211
- Leon, right?

623
00:29:37.211 --> 00:29:38.093
- Yeah.

624
00:29:38.093 --> 00:29:39.652
- Beer?

625
00:29:39.652 --> 00:29:41.903
- Sure. Thanks, man.

626
00:29:41.903 --> 00:29:42.736
(bottles clinking)

627
00:29:42.736 --> 00:29:47.236
- Join the party.
(light guitar music)


628
00:29:48.948 --> 00:29:50.031
- [Daemon] See, my favorite class

629
00:29:50.031 --> 00:29:51.290
was history.
(ping pong ball clacking)


630
00:29:51.290 --> 00:29:52.373
- History?

631
00:29:52.373 --> 00:29:53.938
- What? You don't like it?

632
00:29:53.938 --> 00:29:56.329
- (chuckles) I mean,
it's whatever. (laughing)


633
00:29:56.329 --> 00:29:57.724
- Ah, I love it.

634
00:29:57.724 --> 00:30:00.210
It was the only class
that would keep me going.


635
00:30:00.210 --> 00:30:03.003
I find it very fascinating.

636
00:30:03.003 --> 00:30:04.642
- Mine was theater.

637
00:30:04.642 --> 00:30:06.036
- Uh, yeah.

638
00:30:06.036 --> 00:30:07.314
No, I can see that.

639
00:30:07.314 --> 00:30:09.396
- And what is that supposed to mean?

640
00:30:09.396 --> 00:30:10.229
- Oh, nothing bad.

641
00:30:10.229 --> 00:30:11.062
It just...
(Valerie chuckling)


642
00:30:11.062 --> 00:30:14.219
Like the way you
tell stories on the tour.

643
00:30:14.219 --> 00:30:16.899
- What? Did you watch me?

644
00:30:16.899 --> 00:30:19.515
I have not seen you at any
of the tours. (chuckles)


645
00:30:19.515 --> 00:30:22.075
- Well, may have
snuck in once or twice.

646
00:30:22.075 --> 00:30:23.325
- That's weird.

647
00:30:24.654 --> 00:30:26.291
- Hey.

648
00:30:26.291 --> 00:30:28.910
Do you believe in the
stories that you tell?


649
00:30:28.910 --> 00:30:31.250
- Am I supposed to?

650
00:30:31.250 --> 00:30:32.858
- I don't know.

651
00:30:32.858 --> 00:30:33.691
- Do you?

652
00:30:34.851 --> 00:30:36.273
- Yeah.

653
00:30:36.273 --> 00:30:37.606
I mean, why not?

654
00:30:38.937 --> 00:30:42.392
- I feel like that's
kind of how I see you.


655
00:30:42.392 --> 00:30:44.225
This why not attitude.

656
00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:50.354
- Diane believes in ghosts.

657
00:30:50.354 --> 00:30:52.104
I know that for sure.

658
00:30:54.546 --> 00:30:56.375
- What did you just say?

659
00:30:56.375 --> 00:30:57.208
- Nothing.
(tense music)


660
00:30:57.208 --> 00:30:58.459
She didn't say anything, Diane.

661
00:30:58.459 --> 00:31:00.328
She said you believe in ghosts.

662
00:31:00.328 --> 00:31:01.808
That's all.

663
00:31:01.808 --> 00:31:02.641
- Yeah?

664
00:31:04.505 --> 00:31:07.015
And what do you
have to say about it?

665
00:31:07.015 --> 00:31:08.960
- I was just saying.

666
00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:11.507
- Well, keep it to yourself.

667
00:31:11.507 --> 00:31:12.430
(Gwen chuckling)

668
00:31:12.430 --> 00:31:13.444
Don't make fun of me.

669
00:31:13.444 --> 00:31:14.924
I stayed in that room once.
(ping pong ball clacking)


670
00:31:14.924 --> 00:31:15.757
I saw it.

671
00:31:16.926 --> 00:31:18.676
- What? Like a ghost?

672
00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:22.795
- Yes.

673
00:31:22.795 --> 00:31:26.462
- It couldn't have been
an imaginary friend?


674
00:31:27.899 --> 00:31:30.566
- It wasn't an imaginary friend.

675
00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:34.490
It was a ghost.

676
00:31:35.405 --> 00:31:37.411
- Okay, sure. How old were you?

677
00:31:37.411 --> 00:31:38.776
- Don't patronize me.

678
00:31:38.776 --> 00:31:39.747
- I'm not.

679
00:31:39.747 --> 00:31:41.790
- Can we please not talk about this?

680
00:31:41.790 --> 00:31:42.623
- No, no.

681
00:31:44.845 --> 00:31:46.133
She's the one who brought it up.

682
00:31:46.133 --> 00:31:47.355
- Because you keep bringing it up.

683
00:31:47.355 --> 00:31:48.867
- Don't test me, bitch.

684
00:31:48.867 --> 00:31:49.784
- Hey. Hey.

685
00:31:51.105 --> 00:31:52.621
That is it.

686
00:31:52.621 --> 00:31:55.146
Diane, I think it's time
for you to go to bed.


687
00:31:55.146 --> 00:31:57.101
- No, I don't wanna go to sleep.

688
00:31:57.101 --> 00:31:58.466
- You've had enough.

689
00:31:58.466 --> 00:32:00.049
- Tell me about it.

690
00:32:04.127 --> 00:32:04.960
- Diane!

691
00:32:05.805 --> 00:32:07.674
Jesus Christ.

692
00:32:07.674 --> 00:32:08.586
Stop it!

693
00:32:08.586 --> 00:32:09.603
Take it easy.

694
00:32:09.603 --> 00:32:10.761
- Fuck you, whore!

695
00:32:10.761 --> 00:32:11.594
- [Daemon] Hey.

696
00:32:11.594 --> 00:32:12.427
- [Valerie] Please take her to the lodge.

697
00:32:12.427 --> 00:32:13.285
- I'll take her.

698
00:32:13.285 --> 00:32:14.368
Come on. Hey.

699
00:32:16.029 --> 00:32:19.010
- And I give that fight a 6.9.

700
00:32:19.010 --> 00:32:21.760
(Lucas clapping)

701
00:32:24.387 --> 00:32:27.425
- You know, I respect myself.

702
00:32:27.425 --> 00:32:31.175
And she was just being
a stupid little bitch.


703
00:32:32.648 --> 00:32:33.815
I can't... mm.

704
00:32:35.856 --> 00:32:36.689
Oh.

705
00:32:38.463 --> 00:32:39.525
- You all right?

706
00:32:39.525 --> 00:32:40.358
- I'm fine.

707
00:32:40.358 --> 00:32:42.043
I'm fine. I'm great.

708
00:32:42.043 --> 00:32:44.710
- Come on. Let's get you to bed.

709
00:32:45.599 --> 00:32:46.432
- Hey.

710
00:32:47.788 --> 00:32:49.394
Can I ask you something?

711
00:32:49.394 --> 00:32:50.227
- Yeah.

712
00:32:51.783 --> 00:32:55.450
- Do you think I was
out of line back there?


713
00:32:57.083 --> 00:32:58.500
- No, not at all.

714
00:33:00.971 --> 00:33:01.804
- Good.

715
00:33:04.910 --> 00:33:06.577
She was out of line.

716
00:33:08.037 --> 00:33:10.426
She was being a bitch.

717
00:33:10.426 --> 00:33:11.821
(insects chirping)
- I don't know why


718
00:33:11.821 --> 00:33:13.441
she hates me so much.

719
00:33:13.441 --> 00:33:14.797
She gets all up in my face

720
00:33:14.797 --> 00:33:16.402
and then she projects
everything going wrong


721
00:33:16.402 --> 00:33:18.741
in her fucking life onto me.
- Maybe, but you


722
00:33:18.741 --> 00:33:20.085
didn't help in there.

723
00:33:20.085 --> 00:33:21.711
- What was I supposed to do?

724
00:33:21.711 --> 00:33:23.402
She was treating me like a child.

725
00:33:23.402 --> 00:33:24.596
How would you feel somebody was doing that

726
00:33:24.596 --> 00:33:26.267
to you, Val?
- All right.


727
00:33:26.267 --> 00:33:28.272
You're right, all right. You're right.

728
00:33:28.272 --> 00:33:30.783
But what do you want me to say?

729
00:33:30.783 --> 00:33:32.640
There is no bad guy here.

730
00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:34.078
- She just threw her fucking drink

731
00:33:34.078 --> 00:33:36.327
in my face.
- Maybe she had a reason.


732
00:33:36.327 --> 00:33:38.542
- She's jealous? (scoffs)

733
00:33:38.542 --> 00:33:40.769
- I don't know what
you want me to say.

734
00:33:40.769 --> 00:33:42.612
Daemon is walking her back to the lodge

735
00:33:42.612 --> 00:33:44.949
so she's not stumbling around drunk.

736
00:33:44.949 --> 00:33:48.548
Do you wanna stay and
forget about all this?


737
00:33:48.548 --> 00:33:52.381
Or do you wanna go back
and finish your rooms?


738
00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:56.557
- I guess I'll take option B.

739
00:33:56.557 --> 00:33:57.993
- Fine.

740
00:33:57.993 --> 00:34:00.821
But don't go anywhere near Diane, okay?

741
00:34:00.821 --> 00:34:03.821
- Oh, I know where the bitch sleeps.

742
00:34:07.667 --> 00:34:08.750
No, oh ho ho.

743
00:34:18.772 --> 00:34:22.438
- Well, that looked like that went well.

744
00:34:22.438 --> 00:34:23.771
- How was Diane?

745
00:34:24.807 --> 00:34:28.382
- [Daemon] Mm, she
was fighting it a bit,

746
00:34:28.382 --> 00:34:31.382
but she finally agreed to go to bed.

747
00:34:35.757 --> 00:34:37.007
How 'bout Gwen?

748
00:34:40.854 --> 00:34:42.021
- I'm a bitch.

749
00:34:43.364 --> 00:34:44.864
- [Daemon] How so?

750
00:34:45.753 --> 00:34:47.613
- I should have
just let her go home,

751
00:34:47.613 --> 00:34:50.219
but I (chuckles) fucking yelled at her

752
00:34:50.219 --> 00:34:53.052
and I told her to finish her work.

753
00:34:55.464 --> 00:34:57.381
- That's taking charge.

754
00:35:00.670 --> 00:35:01.503
- I know.

755
00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:14.213
- My dad, he
had this shop in town

756
00:35:14.213 --> 00:35:15.528
and fuck, I loved being there.

757
00:35:15.528 --> 00:35:18.341
You know, being at the shop,
hanging out with the guys.


758
00:35:18.341 --> 00:35:20.174
Oh man, this guy, Lou, Uncle Lou.

759
00:35:20.174 --> 00:35:21.738
But fuck, he wasn't my real uncle.

760
00:35:21.738 --> 00:35:23.359
Just one of those dudes
that really good friend


761
00:35:23.359 --> 00:35:24.216
with your dad, you know.

762
00:35:24.216 --> 00:35:25.049
- Right, right.
- Fuck.


763
00:35:25.049 --> 00:35:26.605
He was Canadian, 
French Canadian.

764
00:35:26.605 --> 00:35:28.063
His real name was Louis.

765
00:35:28.063 --> 00:35:29.848
(Lucas and Cooper laughing)

766
00:35:29.848 --> 00:35:31.722
We were fucking at the shop one time

767
00:35:31.722 --> 00:35:33.054
and this storm's coming through.

768
00:35:33.054 --> 00:35:34.351
And my dad's like, "All right,
(fingers snap)


769
00:35:34.351 --> 00:35:35.184
let's close it down.

770
00:35:35.184 --> 00:35:36.017
Storm's coming through.

771
00:35:36.017 --> 00:35:36.850
We gotta close this shit down."

772
00:35:36.850 --> 00:35:39.296
And all of a sudden, boom, lights out,

773
00:35:39.296 --> 00:35:40.219
black, fucking black.

774
00:35:40.219 --> 00:35:41.174
There's no windows.

775
00:35:41.174 --> 00:35:42.016
It's a garage, man.

776
00:35:42.016 --> 00:35:44.926
Fucking uncle, 
Monsieur Louis, (chuckles)

777
00:35:44.926 --> 00:35:48.083
finds a firecracker in his pocket,

778
00:35:48.083 --> 00:35:48.916
pulls it out, and goes

779
00:35:48.916 --> 00:35:51.154
"All right, we got five seconds
to find a fucking door."


780
00:35:51.154 --> 00:35:51.987
Everyone's scrambling.

781
00:35:51.987 --> 00:35:52.820
Can you imagine?

782
00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:53.653
We're like, oh shit!

783
00:35:53.653 --> 00:35:54.567
Boom, the thing goes off.

784
00:35:54.567 --> 00:35:56.002
Fucking, oh my God.

785
00:35:56.002 --> 00:35:57.943
Smoke alarm fucking goes off.

786
00:35:57.943 --> 00:36:00.514
Fire department had to come
and get us out of there.


787
00:36:00.514 --> 00:36:02.517
- [Leon] Yeah, I just liked
the look and the sound of cars.


788
00:36:02.517 --> 00:36:04.802
I don't really know all
the types or whatever.


789
00:36:04.802 --> 00:36:05.658
- Same.

790
00:36:05.658 --> 00:36:07.210
If it runs, I'm good.

791
00:36:07.210 --> 00:36:10.174
- See, Leon, this is why Coop
here drives a piece of shit


792
00:36:10.174 --> 00:36:11.453
because he thinks that way.

793
00:36:11.453 --> 00:36:12.788
What do you drive?

794
00:36:12.788 --> 00:36:13.639
- [Leon] A bike.

795
00:36:13.639 --> 00:36:15.663
- (laughing) A bike.

796
00:36:15.663 --> 00:36:16.655
Are you shitting me?

797
00:36:16.655 --> 00:36:18.141
- Speaking of stories,

798
00:36:18.141 --> 00:36:20.703
Gwen said Diane believed
in ghosts or some shit.


799
00:36:20.703 --> 00:36:22.588
- [Valerie] I don't know.

800
00:36:22.588 --> 00:36:25.608
Diane is going through
something right now.


801
00:36:25.608 --> 00:36:28.358
She thinks Gwen is fucking Steve.

802
00:36:29.433 --> 00:36:30.680
- Who's Steven?

803
00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:32.119
- Her husband.

804
00:36:32.119 --> 00:36:33.519
- (scoffs) I wouldn't be surprised.

805
00:36:33.519 --> 00:36:35.660
- [Daemon] She said
she saw a ghost, right?


806
00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:39.334
I mean, she's the one who
claims room 510 is haunted.


807
00:36:39.334 --> 00:36:40.716
That's why I wanted a job here.

808
00:36:40.716 --> 00:36:42.857
- What, 'cause there's a haunted room?

809
00:36:42.857 --> 00:36:45.436
- [Daemon] No, 'cause
there's a lot of shit here.


810
00:36:45.436 --> 00:36:48.982
It's a lot of unsolved mysteries.

811
00:36:48.982 --> 00:36:50.827
Like the Lillian story.

812
00:36:50.827 --> 00:36:52.736
That's what they call it anyway.

813
00:36:52.736 --> 00:36:54.789
- Ooh. Sounds scary.

814
00:36:54.789 --> 00:36:56.238
- [Daemon] Just wait.

815
00:36:56.238 --> 00:37:00.029
It was Lilian's honeymoon
and long story short,


816
00:37:00.029 --> 00:37:01.328
she walked into the room

817
00:37:01.328 --> 00:37:04.612
and found her husband having
an affair with the maid.


818
00:37:04.612 --> 00:37:07.279
(door clatters)

819
00:37:14.763 --> 00:37:16.397
- Eh, sounds familiar.

820
00:37:16.397 --> 00:37:20.198
- [Daemon] Yeah, well
then she killed herself


821
00:37:20.198 --> 00:37:22.522
either by hanging or slitting her wrists

822
00:37:22.522 --> 00:37:23.677
or jumping out of the window.

823
00:37:23.677 --> 00:37:26.193
It was never really specified.

824
00:37:26.193 --> 00:37:28.233
Or maybe it was and I just forgot.

825
00:37:28.233 --> 00:37:30.342
- (scoffs) I think you
could tell the difference.


826
00:37:30.342 --> 00:37:32.091
- [Cooper] I heard she pushed
the maid out the window


827
00:37:32.091 --> 00:37:34.742
and then jumped with her after
she realized what she'd done.


828
00:37:34.742 --> 00:37:37.803
- [Daemon] You're probably
right but after that


829
00:37:37.803 --> 00:37:39.866
Lillian's ghost never left.

830
00:37:39.866 --> 00:37:42.399
It's said that whenever
someone enters the room,


831
00:37:42.399 --> 00:37:44.810
she goes and wanders the hallways.

832
00:37:44.810 --> 00:37:47.130
It's also said that
she'll hide in a closet


833
00:37:47.130 --> 00:37:49.170
and moan and cry.
(woman crying)


834
00:37:49.170 --> 00:37:51.910
Other than that, she's probably
the most benevolent ghost


835
00:37:51.910 --> 00:37:53.441
you could ever meet.

836
00:37:53.441 --> 00:37:56.310
Unless you have bad mojo.

837
00:37:56.310 --> 00:38:00.137
Then you walk in the room,
you need to be scared.


838
00:38:00.137 --> 00:38:01.741
- [Cooper] Bullshit.

839
00:38:01.741 --> 00:38:03.703
- [Daemon] I wouldn't say that.

840
00:38:03.703 --> 00:38:05.168
- [Cooper] Why? 
Can she hear me?

841
00:38:05.168 --> 00:38:07.981
- [Daemon] If she senses
you don't believe her story,


842
00:38:07.981 --> 00:38:10.566
then she fucks with you.

843
00:38:10.566 --> 00:38:13.540
- Dude, you sound like my dad
trying to tell a ghost story.


844
00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:14.734
Quit while your ahead.

845
00:38:14.734 --> 00:38:16.684
- Oh, I got a better one.

846
00:38:16.684 --> 00:38:18.489
- [Lucas] Go for it.

847
00:38:18.489 --> 00:38:22.499
- Well, this happened
when I was in high school.


848
00:38:22.499 --> 00:38:23.332
There's this kid
(gentle guitar music)


849
00:38:23.332 --> 00:38:24.570
that lived around here.

850
00:38:24.570 --> 00:38:25.519
Didn't really have anybody.

851
00:38:25.519 --> 00:38:28.763
No friends, shitty home life.

852
00:38:28.763 --> 00:38:33.763
And then this girl named Sarah
came to the lodge one season.


853
00:38:47.540 --> 00:38:48.373
- Hey, hi.

854
00:38:49.730 --> 00:38:51.868
Are you staying here too?

855
00:38:51.868 --> 00:38:53.318
- No, not really.

856
00:38:53.318 --> 00:38:56.132
My dad's the groundskeeper
so we live close by.


857
00:38:56.132 --> 00:38:57.763
- Is your dad here?

858
00:38:57.763 --> 00:39:01.221
- No, it's Sunday so he's
at home watching the game.


859
00:39:01.221 --> 00:39:03.170
- Ah. Football?

860
00:39:03.170 --> 00:39:04.003
- [Boy] Yeah.

861
00:39:04.003 --> 00:39:08.100
- Yeah, we had to force my
dad be out here as well.


862
00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:10.004
Are you a football fan?

863
00:39:10.004 --> 00:39:11.754
- Uh, no, not really.

864
00:39:12.693 --> 00:39:15.074
- You're kinda strange.

865
00:39:15.074 --> 00:39:16.318
- I'm sorry.

866
00:39:16.318 --> 00:39:17.435
- No need to be sorry.

867
00:39:17.435 --> 00:39:18.548
I'm just as strange.

868
00:39:18.548 --> 00:39:20.693
Oh, watch this face.

869
00:39:20.693 --> 00:39:24.089
(giggles) See, I'm weird.

870
00:39:24.089 --> 00:39:25.262
I like weird people.

871
00:39:25.262 --> 00:39:26.898
- [Mother] Sarah, we need to get going.

872
00:39:26.898 --> 00:39:28.857
Your dad's waiting.

873
00:39:28.857 --> 00:39:31.138
- Okay, well, I gotta go.

874
00:39:31.138 --> 00:39:31.971
- [Both] Bye

875
00:39:31.971 --> 00:39:33.054
- Hey, Sarah.

876
00:39:33.986 --> 00:39:35.653
Mom says time to go.

877
00:39:37.026 --> 00:39:37.859
- Bye.

878
00:39:41.962 --> 00:39:43.886
- Kid got attached quickly.

879
00:39:43.886 --> 00:39:46.409
He was happy to actually have
someone that cared about him.


880
00:39:46.409 --> 00:39:48.916
And for the first time in his life,

881
00:39:48.916 --> 00:39:52.044
he had someone that loved him.

882
00:39:52.044 --> 00:39:53.526
Well, that was at
least till he found out

883
00:39:53.526 --> 00:39:55.483
that Sarah was leaving and, you know,

884
00:39:55.483 --> 00:39:57.429
this kid just really didn't like that.

885
00:39:57.429 --> 00:40:02.115
He just made this new friend
and didn't wanna see her go.


886
00:40:02.115 --> 00:40:03.050
He remembered this spot

887
00:40:03.050 --> 00:40:04.383
where his mom would take him to

888
00:40:04.383 --> 00:40:06.990
whenever his dad got
shit-faced and abusive.


889
00:40:06.990 --> 00:40:11.573
(scoffs) Was over by where
you do the tours, Valerie.


890
00:40:11.573 --> 00:40:14.337
He took Sarah into those caves.

891
00:40:14.337 --> 00:40:17.025
- So, so what? 
What'd he do to her?

892
00:40:17.025 --> 00:40:18.192
- He left her.

893
00:40:19.595 --> 00:40:22.505
I mean, he didn't wanna
hurt her or anything.


894
00:40:22.505 --> 00:40:25.936
He just didn't wanna see her go.

895
00:40:25.936 --> 00:40:27.936
I guess how his mom did.

896
00:40:28.976 --> 00:40:32.585
(sighs) He was found
on one of the trails

897
00:40:32.585 --> 00:40:35.027
by a search party looking for Sarah.

898
00:40:35.027 --> 00:40:37.446
He wouldn't say a word
about what had happened.


899
00:40:37.446 --> 00:40:40.187
He just shut down, went
completely catatonic.


900
00:40:40.187 --> 00:40:43.086
No and since they never
found her or anything,


901
00:40:43.086 --> 00:40:45.677
they couldn't charge him with a crime.

902
00:40:45.677 --> 00:40:47.882
Coincidentally enough, his
father just so happened


903
00:40:47.882 --> 00:40:50.186
to go AWOL that same night.

904
00:40:50.186 --> 00:40:51.346
He didn't have any other family

905
00:40:51.346 --> 00:40:52.346
that could take care of him

906
00:40:52.346 --> 00:40:54.705
so state didn't have any other choice

907
00:40:54.705 --> 00:40:58.301
but to send them to a mental hospital.

908
00:40:58.301 --> 00:41:00.801
Last I heard he's still there.

909
00:41:01.804 --> 00:41:05.526
- [Daemon] Did they ever find Sarah?

910
00:41:05.526 --> 00:41:07.876
- There's different variations.

911
00:41:07.876 --> 00:41:09.666
Some say they found her body.

912
00:41:09.666 --> 00:41:14.044
Some say she fell down a
shaft in the fucking caves.


913
00:41:14.044 --> 00:41:17.341
Some say the kid's father kidnapped her.

914
00:41:17.341 --> 00:41:19.024
Others say that she found her way out

915
00:41:19.024 --> 00:41:21.941
by listening to the sound of water.

916
00:41:25.025 --> 00:41:26.535
- I'll walk out with you.

917
00:41:26.535 --> 00:41:27.368
- [Valerie] Bye, Leon.

918
00:41:27.368 --> 00:41:28.201
- [Lucas] See ya, dude.

919
00:41:28.201 --> 00:41:30.304
- Cool ghost story, bro.

920
00:41:30.304 --> 00:41:33.304
(doorbell tinkling)

921
00:41:34.542 --> 00:41:35.931
- That guy was fucking nutty.

922
00:41:35.931 --> 00:41:37.438
- Yeah, that got weird.

923
00:41:37.438 --> 00:41:38.710
- I got awkward.

924
00:41:38.710 --> 00:41:40.038
- [Valerie] You two are babies.

925
00:41:40.038 --> 00:41:42.550
- That story didn't freak
you out in the least bit?


926
00:41:42.550 --> 00:41:43.782
He knew so much detail.

927
00:41:43.782 --> 00:41:44.891
- [Valerie] He reads a lot.

928
00:41:44.891 --> 00:41:45.724
He said that.

929
00:41:45.724 --> 00:41:48.077
- Bullshit. That's his life story.

930
00:41:48.077 --> 00:41:49.197
How the fuck am I supposed to sleep

931
00:41:49.197 --> 00:41:51.597
with some fucked up dude
sleeping yards away?


932
00:41:51.597 --> 00:41:54.871
- Okay, yeah, now I think
he's over-exaggerating.


933
00:41:54.871 --> 00:41:56.247
(insects chirping)

934
00:41:56.247 --> 00:41:58.738
- All right, dude. 
Well, that was fun.

935
00:41:58.738 --> 00:42:01.975
- (chuckles) Yeah, it was cool evening.

936
00:42:01.975 --> 00:42:03.728
Fuck, man, I'm sorry if I
killed the vibe in there.


937
00:42:03.728 --> 00:42:05.439
I just fucking don't get out very much.

938
00:42:05.439 --> 00:42:06.924
- No, man, it's not you.

939
00:42:06.924 --> 00:42:08.674
Don't worry about it.

940
00:42:10.655 --> 00:42:12.265
- Well, you wanna do it again,

941
00:42:12.265 --> 00:42:13.462
you know where to find me.

942
00:42:13.462 --> 00:42:14.379
- For sure.

943
00:42:17.826 --> 00:42:20.826
All right, well, drive or ride safe.

944
00:42:22.272 --> 00:42:23.105
- Right on, man.

945
00:42:23.105 --> 00:42:25.022
I'll see you next time.

946
00:42:29.145 --> 00:42:31.332
(door clattering)
(doorbell tinkling)


947
00:42:31.332 --> 00:42:33.497
- I can't be the only
one who felt that, right?


948
00:42:33.497 --> 00:42:34.955
Seriously, you guys.

949
00:42:34.955 --> 00:42:36.493
- How much did you drink?

950
00:42:36.493 --> 00:42:39.295
- (scoffs) Clearly not enough.

951
00:42:39.295 --> 00:42:42.324
(Lucas chuckling)

952
00:42:42.324 --> 00:42:43.604
(Daemon sighs)

953
00:42:43.604 --> 00:42:45.104
- What time is it?

954
00:42:46.343 --> 00:42:48.143
- It's almost one.

955
00:42:48.143 --> 00:42:51.433
- It's that early? (chuckles)

956
00:42:51.433 --> 00:42:54.852
- Well, I'm down to
stay up if you are.

957
00:42:54.852 --> 00:42:57.852
- Yeah. Anybody else wanna hang out?

958
00:43:02.223 --> 00:43:03.183
- Boo!

959
00:43:03.183 --> 00:43:04.016
- Okay, man.

960
00:43:04.016 --> 00:43:06.488
- Nope. I'm going to bed.

961
00:43:06.488 --> 00:43:08.061
I call the extra room.

962
00:43:08.061 --> 00:43:08.911
- [Cooper] Wanna share?

963
00:43:08.911 --> 00:43:09.960
- No!

964
00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:11.874
Fuck, Coop. Keep the couch.

965
00:43:11.874 --> 00:43:13.318
- [Cooper] Oh oh.

966
00:43:13.318 --> 00:43:17.628
- Do you wanna just take
some drinks upstairs?


967
00:43:17.628 --> 00:43:18.461
- Yeah.

968
00:43:19.451 --> 00:43:20.284
Sure.

969
00:43:21.684 --> 00:43:22.826
Definitely.

970
00:43:22.826 --> 00:43:23.659
- Okay.

971
00:43:23.659 --> 00:43:25.225
All right.

972
00:43:25.225 --> 00:43:27.369
Good night, guys.

973
00:43:27.369 --> 00:43:30.132
Great work today by the way.

974
00:43:30.132 --> 00:43:31.215
- Yeah, no worries.

975
00:43:31.215 --> 00:43:33.215
I'll just be here alone.

976
00:43:36.532 --> 00:43:37.822
That's okay.

977
00:43:37.822 --> 00:43:38.739
I got Judy.

978
00:43:41.812 --> 00:43:43.520
(Valerie laughing)

979
00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:44.353
- [Daemon] That's so...

980
00:43:44.353 --> 00:43:45.186
- Well...

981
00:43:45.186 --> 00:43:46.019
- [Daemon] Then what?

982
00:43:46.019 --> 00:43:49.488
- Uh! So then we broke up.
(gentle music)


983
00:43:49.488 --> 00:43:54.349
(laughing) High school wasn't
really the best for me.


984
00:43:54.349 --> 00:43:55.766
- Oh, me neither.

985
00:43:57.147 --> 00:43:58.276
(sighs) I hated it.

986
00:43:58.276 --> 00:44:00.237
(both laughing)

987
00:44:00.237 --> 00:44:01.070
So fucked up.

988
00:44:01.070 --> 00:44:03.768
I barely even remember it.

989
00:44:03.768 --> 00:44:06.329
- Because you were so fucked up?

990
00:44:06.329 --> 00:44:08.242
- Well, that too.
(Valerie laughing)


991
00:44:08.242 --> 00:44:10.909
(both laughing)

992
00:44:11.869 --> 00:44:13.343
- So what are you doing after this?

993
00:44:13.343 --> 00:44:15.835
Do you have a job lined up?

994
00:44:15.835 --> 00:44:17.252
- Mm, not really.

995
00:44:20.275 --> 00:44:23.842
Probably just gonna be unemployed

996
00:44:23.842 --> 00:44:26.425
till this place opens up again.

997
00:44:27.415 --> 00:44:29.495
- Well, if you want,

998
00:44:29.495 --> 00:44:30.860
and only if you want,

999
00:44:30.860 --> 00:44:32.527
I could ask my uncle

1000
00:44:34.299 --> 00:44:35.734
about a job.

1001
00:44:35.734 --> 00:44:36.655
He runs a restaurant

1002
00:44:36.655 --> 00:44:40.738
and that's where I'm gonna
be working after this.


1003
00:44:43.011 --> 00:44:43.936
- Well, yeah.

1004
00:44:43.936 --> 00:44:45.269
I mean, why not?

1005
00:44:48.689 --> 00:44:51.272
Will I have to be a dish bitch?

1006
00:44:53.107 --> 00:44:56.224
- (gasps) Well, now that I've seen

1007
00:44:56.224 --> 00:44:59.141
how well you wash plates, probably.

1008
00:45:00.614 --> 00:45:01.920
(Valerie laughing)

1009
00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:03.837
- [Daemon] Fair enough.

1010
00:45:10.676 --> 00:45:11.509
- Ah.

1011
00:45:13.474 --> 00:45:14.641
Now I'm tired.

1012
00:45:16.851 --> 00:45:18.018
And I'm drunk.

1013
00:45:22.267 --> 00:45:26.684
- [Daemon] Well, we should
probably tuck you in then.


1014
00:45:28.921 --> 00:45:31.421
- Oh, you're gonna tuck me in?

1015
00:45:34.241 --> 00:45:35.366
- I mean if you want.

1016
00:45:35.366 --> 00:45:38.283
(Valerie chuckles)

1017
00:45:39.331 --> 00:45:40.164
- Please.

1018
00:45:49.856 --> 00:45:51.689
- [Daemon] Good night.

1019
00:45:52.881 --> 00:45:53.964
- Good night.

1020
00:45:59.259 --> 00:46:02.465
(gentle music)
(water trickling)


1021
00:46:02.465 --> 00:46:05.580
- Just like that
we're gonna catch a fish.

1022
00:46:05.580 --> 00:46:07.377
- How long do we have to wait?

1023
00:46:07.377 --> 00:46:09.388
- Oh, that's the thing about fishing.

1024
00:46:09.388 --> 00:46:10.638
Takes patience.

1025
00:46:12.119 --> 00:46:14.530
It's kinda metaphorical
when you think about it.


1026
00:46:14.530 --> 00:46:16.039
- Metaphorical?

1027
00:46:16.039 --> 00:46:19.839
- Oh yeah, you know,
it has meaning to it.

1028
00:46:19.839 --> 00:46:20.672
That's the thing about life.

1029
00:46:20.672 --> 00:46:21.954
You can't just rush into it.

1030
00:46:21.954 --> 00:46:23.478
You need patience.

1031
00:46:23.478 --> 00:46:25.399
Otherwise you get overwhelmed.

1032
00:46:25.399 --> 00:46:27.048
You know what overwhelmed means, right?

1033
00:46:27.048 --> 00:46:28.114
- Yes, Dad.

1034
00:46:28.114 --> 00:46:29.654
- Well, I'm just checking.

1035
00:46:29.654 --> 00:46:30.487
When I was your age,

1036
00:46:30.487 --> 00:46:32.034
I didn't even know what it meant.

1037
00:46:32.034 --> 00:46:33.871
- I have Mom's genes I guess.

1038
00:46:33.871 --> 00:46:34.758
She was smarter.

1039
00:46:34.758 --> 00:46:37.121
- (chuckles) Well, that's true.

1040
00:46:37.121 --> 00:46:39.621
But don't talk to me that way.

1041
00:46:44.423 --> 00:46:45.951
So what are you writing over there?

1042
00:46:45.951 --> 00:46:47.717
- Nothing. Just stuff.

1043
00:46:47.717 --> 00:46:48.826
- Stuff, eh.

1044
00:46:48.826 --> 00:46:49.661
Well, I like stuff.

1045
00:46:49.661 --> 00:46:50.997
What kind of stuff we talking?

1046
00:46:50.997 --> 00:46:52.394
- I don't know.

1047
00:46:52.394 --> 00:46:53.951
- Sounds exciting.

1048
00:46:53.951 --> 00:46:57.298
- I don't know how to explain it.

1049
00:46:57.298 --> 00:46:59.177
- Is it like a diary or something?

1050
00:46:59.177 --> 00:47:00.510
- Well, kind of.

1051
00:47:02.877 --> 00:47:05.135
- Your mom used to love to write.

1052
00:47:05.135 --> 00:47:07.856
You keep at it, you'll
become a big time writer.


1053
00:47:07.856 --> 00:47:09.795
- Maybe one day I can
take over the tours too,


1054
00:47:09.795 --> 00:47:12.372
or at least help you out a little.

1055
00:47:12.372 --> 00:47:14.376
- Hey, you know, 
I don't want you to think

1056
00:47:14.376 --> 00:47:17.450
that you need to be
stuck with your old man.


1057
00:47:17.450 --> 00:47:18.283
I appreciate the help,

1058
00:47:18.283 --> 00:47:21.251
but I think you
need to see the world.

1059
00:47:21.251 --> 00:47:22.387
It's something that me and your mom

1060
00:47:22.387 --> 00:47:25.637
really wish we could have done more of.

1061
00:47:28.237 --> 00:47:30.501
- Where do you think she is?

1062
00:47:30.501 --> 00:47:34.183
Like, do you think there's a heaven?

1063
00:47:34.183 --> 00:47:35.933
- Well, I don't know.

1064
00:47:37.571 --> 00:47:40.154
Not knowing's not so bad.

1065
00:47:40.154 --> 00:47:44.286
Wherever your mom is,
she's doing just fine.


1066
00:47:44.286 --> 00:47:45.786
- Do you miss her?

1067
00:47:47.878 --> 00:47:49.378
- Yeah, every day.

1068
00:47:50.238 --> 00:47:51.194
But I got you.

1069
00:47:51.194 --> 00:47:52.771
You look just like her.

1070
00:47:52.771 --> 00:47:54.854
It's like she never left.

1071
00:47:56.168 --> 00:47:57.001
- [Valerie] Hey, Dad.

1072
00:47:57.001 --> 00:47:57.834
- Yeah.

1073
00:47:57.834 --> 00:48:01.852
- [Valerie] I'll always be here for you.

1074
00:48:01.852 --> 00:48:03.350
- Oh, looks like we got one.

1075
00:48:03.350 --> 00:48:04.183
Here, take it.

1076
00:48:04.183 --> 00:48:09.183
(glass shattering)
(ominous music)


1077
00:48:20.395 --> 00:48:21.283
(switch clicking)

1078
00:48:21.283 --> 00:48:22.700
- [Valerie] Shit.

1079
00:48:37.703 --> 00:48:39.241
Fuck! Oh!

1080
00:48:39.241 --> 00:48:40.569
What the hell are you doing?

1081
00:48:40.569 --> 00:48:42.578
- Oh, I was just using the bathroom.

1082
00:48:42.578 --> 00:48:43.634
Did you hear that noise?

1083
00:48:43.634 --> 00:48:47.023
- Yes. And the
power is out again too.

1084
00:48:47.023 --> 00:48:48.311
- You guys hear that shit?

1085
00:48:48.311 --> 00:48:49.269
- Yeah.

1086
00:48:49.269 --> 00:48:50.672
- And the power's off too.

1087
00:48:50.672 --> 00:48:52.778
- Yeah, we know.

1088
00:48:52.778 --> 00:48:53.725
- Did you guys hear that?

1089
00:48:53.725 --> 00:48:54.628
- [Valerie] Yes.

1090
00:48:54.628 --> 00:48:57.178
- Sounded like somebody broke a window.

1091
00:48:57.178 --> 00:48:59.245
- Fuck, do you think someone's
breaking into the lodge?


1092
00:48:59.245 --> 00:49:00.428
- You want me to go check?

1093
00:49:00.428 --> 00:49:02.130
- It's my job. 
I gotta check.

1094
00:49:02.130 --> 00:49:04.963
- [Daemon] Wait, 
I'll go with you.

1095
00:49:07.372 --> 00:49:09.526
- Shit. Wanna join 'em?

1096
00:49:09.526 --> 00:49:12.859
- (tongue clicks) Sure.

1097
00:49:14.065 --> 00:49:14.898
- [Daemon] Slow down.

1098
00:49:14.898 --> 00:49:15.981
- [Valerie] If someone's
breaking in there,


1099
00:49:15.981 --> 00:49:17.344
I could lose my job.

1100
00:49:17.344 --> 00:49:18.828
- [Daemon] Well, you're not
working here anymore anyway


1101
00:49:18.828 --> 00:49:19.661
so what's the difference.

1102
00:49:19.661 --> 00:49:21.467
- That's not funny.

1103
00:49:21.467 --> 00:49:22.300
(Valerie screams)

1104
00:49:22.300 --> 00:49:23.133
(scary music)

1105
00:49:23.133 --> 00:49:23.966
Oh my god.

1106
00:49:24.801 --> 00:49:25.634
How did this happen?

1107
00:49:25.634 --> 00:49:28.134
How could this fucking happen?

1108
00:49:28.968 --> 00:49:29.801
(Lucas retching)

1109
00:49:29.801 --> 00:49:30.634
- Fuck!

1110
00:49:31.759 --> 00:49:33.691
Oh, fucking Diane.

1111
00:49:33.691 --> 00:49:34.767
- [Valerie] Think she did it?

1112
00:49:34.767 --> 00:49:36.405
- Well, look what the fuck?

1113
00:49:36.405 --> 00:49:38.986
- Diane is incapable of murdering anyone.

1114
00:49:38.986 --> 00:49:40.897
- Then explain this, Val.

1115
00:49:40.897 --> 00:49:41.790
- What happened?
(tense music)


1116
00:49:41.790 --> 00:49:43.635
- [Cooper] Jesus Christ.

1117
00:49:43.635 --> 00:49:45.584
Where the fuck did you come from?

1118
00:49:45.584 --> 00:49:47.508
- I heard a crash and screaming.

1119
00:49:47.508 --> 00:49:49.148
- Look, let's just go back inside

1120
00:49:49.148 --> 00:49:50.819
and we'll talk about it in there.

1121
00:49:50.819 --> 00:49:52.974
- The fucking power
isn't working in there.


1122
00:49:52.974 --> 00:49:54.418
- I was just gonna say that.

1123
00:49:54.418 --> 00:49:55.801
- I'm gonna go get help.

1124
00:49:55.801 --> 00:49:57.718
- Wait, don't go alone.

1125
00:50:00.135 --> 00:50:01.718
I'm going with her.

1126
00:50:02.718 --> 00:50:04.756
Don't touch anything.

1127
00:50:04.756 --> 00:50:05.589
Stay put.

1128
00:50:06.429 --> 00:50:07.262
Wait.

1129
00:50:08.545 --> 00:50:10.738
- Like I'm dying to touch
a dead body. (chuckles)


1130
00:50:10.738 --> 00:50:13.571
(low tense music)

1131
00:50:15.413 --> 00:50:18.453
(phone clicking)

1132
00:50:18.453 --> 00:50:19.950
- Fuck you fuck.

1133
00:50:19.950 --> 00:50:21.295
- What?

1134
00:50:21.295 --> 00:50:22.524
- [Valerie] The phones are working.

1135
00:50:22.524 --> 00:50:24.150
(phone clacking)

1136
00:50:24.150 --> 00:50:24.983
- Shit.

1137
00:50:24.983 --> 00:50:26.691
- My god, I
don't know what to do.

1138
00:50:26.691 --> 00:50:29.976
I don't know what the fuck is happening?

1139
00:50:29.976 --> 00:50:32.226
- Hey, hey. Hey, calm down.

1140
00:50:33.065 --> 00:50:35.532
(Valerie crying)
It's okay.


1141
00:50:35.532 --> 00:50:37.544
Hey, I'm gonna get my car.

1142
00:50:37.544 --> 00:50:41.093
We'll go to town
and I'll get help, okay?

1143
00:50:41.093 --> 00:50:42.176
- Okay. Okay.

1144
00:50:43.185 --> 00:50:44.518
- Okay. Come on.

1145
00:50:53.975 --> 00:50:56.522
(doorbell tinkling)

1146
00:50:56.522 --> 00:50:57.769
- Did you guys get help?

1147
00:50:57.769 --> 00:50:58.885
- Phones are dead.

1148
00:50:58.885 --> 00:51:00.336
- Ah, so we're fucked.

1149
00:51:00.336 --> 00:51:02.617
- No, I've got my truck.

1150
00:51:02.617 --> 00:51:03.797
We're gonna go to the nearest gas station.

1151
00:51:03.797 --> 00:51:04.782
We'll get help.

1152
00:51:04.782 --> 00:51:06.699
- Okay. Well I think...

1153
00:51:07.645 --> 00:51:08.856
Fuck, maybe we should all go

1154
00:51:08.856 --> 00:51:09.689
just in case.
- No.


1155
00:51:09.689 --> 00:51:12.106
No, we can't just leave them.

1156
00:51:14.227 --> 00:51:15.311
- I'll stay.

1157
00:51:15.311 --> 00:51:16.205
- Perfect.
(fingers snap)


1158
00:51:16.205 --> 00:51:17.200
Fucking Leon's staying here.

1159
00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:19.067
Let's get the fuck outta here.

1160
00:51:19.067 --> 00:51:22.067
(doorbell tinkling)

1161
00:51:23.487 --> 00:51:24.404
Fuck, Coop!

1162
00:51:26.678 --> 00:51:29.021
(doorbell tinkling)
(suspenseful music)


1163
00:51:29.021 --> 00:51:32.220
(starter revving)

1164
00:51:32.220 --> 00:51:35.305
- [Valerie] Fucking kidding me, right?

1165
00:51:35.305 --> 00:51:37.844
- Hey, the car won't start.

1166
00:51:37.844 --> 00:51:38.927
- [Lucas] What?

1167
00:51:38.927 --> 00:51:39.771
- My car won't start.

1168
00:51:39.771 --> 00:51:41.125
Can you drive us?

1169
00:51:41.125 --> 00:51:41.958
- Ah, fuck, yeah.

1170
00:51:41.958 --> 00:51:45.208
Let me clear some
shit out of the back.

1171
00:51:46.535 --> 00:51:48.345
- It's fucking freezing out here, dude.

1172
00:51:48.345 --> 00:51:50.397
Gimme your keys.

1173
00:51:50.397 --> 00:51:53.064
(keys jangling)

1174
00:51:59.744 --> 00:52:01.574
(starter revving)

1175
00:52:01.574 --> 00:52:04.074
(sighs) Fuck!

1176
00:52:05.874 --> 00:52:10.541
- Stop trying to start the
car and pop the fucking hood.


1177
00:52:13.347 --> 00:52:14.716
Fuck!

1178
00:52:14.716 --> 00:52:15.799
- [Valerie] What?

1179
00:52:15.799 --> 00:52:17.016
- [Lucas] Someone fucked with the cars.

1180
00:52:17.016 --> 00:52:17.849
- What do you mean?

1181
00:52:17.849 --> 00:52:19.440
- I mean, Val, someone
fucked with the fucking cars.


1182
00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:21.401
We're not going anywhere.

1183
00:52:21.401 --> 00:52:22.234
- What do you mean?

1184
00:52:22.234 --> 00:52:23.067
Well, what do we do?

1185
00:52:23.067 --> 00:52:24.025
What's the next step?

1186
00:52:24.025 --> 00:52:24.858
- What are you looking at me for?

1187
00:52:24.858 --> 00:52:25.910
You're the one who's in fucking charge.

1188
00:52:25.910 --> 00:52:26.784
I don't know.

1189
00:52:26.784 --> 00:52:28.117
- I don't know what to do.

1190
00:52:28.117 --> 00:52:28.950
My dad would be furious

1191
00:52:28.950 --> 00:52:29.783
with me right now.
- Your dad?


1192
00:52:29.783 --> 00:52:30.616
- We're gonna talk-
- Fuck you, Cooper!


1193
00:52:30.616 --> 00:52:31.772
about your fucking dad?
- Fuck you!


1194
00:52:31.772 --> 00:52:32.774
- We gotta get the fuck outta here.

1195
00:52:32.774 --> 00:52:34.281
(all shouting)

1196
00:52:34.281 --> 00:52:35.800
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1197
00:52:35.800 --> 00:52:37.281
Calm down.

1198
00:52:37.281 --> 00:52:39.032
(tense music)

1199
00:52:39.032 --> 00:52:39.948
- [Cooper] I agree, guys.

1200
00:52:39.948 --> 00:52:41.439
Let's go back inside.

1201
00:52:41.439 --> 00:52:42.929
- Coop, are you fucking nuts, man?

1202
00:52:42.929 --> 00:52:45.174
I'm not going back inside
until we get some help.


1203
00:52:45.174 --> 00:52:47.842
Look, let's just walk to the next town.

1204
00:52:47.842 --> 00:52:49.367
- That's 15 miles away.

1205
00:52:49.367 --> 00:52:50.436
- Yeah, I fucking know that, Val,

1206
00:52:50.436 --> 00:52:51.809
but it's better than being here.

1207
00:52:51.809 --> 00:52:53.892
- Wait. Shut the fuck up.

1208
00:52:56.031 --> 00:52:57.928
Have an idea.

1209
00:52:57.928 --> 00:52:59.802
Hey, I really appreciate this.
(insects chirping)


1210
00:52:59.802 --> 00:53:02.746
I mean, everybody's freaking out.

1211
00:53:02.746 --> 00:53:03.836
Thank you.

1212
00:53:03.836 --> 00:53:05.036
- No worries, man.

1213
00:53:05.036 --> 00:53:06.597
(bike clattering)

1214
00:53:06.597 --> 00:53:07.997
- [Daemon] We'll be here.

1215
00:53:07.997 --> 00:53:09.825
- Leon, do you want
someone to come with you?


1216
00:53:09.825 --> 00:53:11.587
- No, I'll make it
much faster on my own.

1217
00:53:11.587 --> 00:53:14.761
You guys just chill in the cabin.

1218
00:53:14.761 --> 00:53:17.577
Someone needs to just go
check the breaker box.


1219
00:53:17.577 --> 00:53:19.327
A fuse probably blew.

1220
00:53:25.738 --> 00:53:28.050
- Do you guys think we can
actually trust this guy?


1221
00:53:28.050 --> 00:53:30.133
- What choice do we have?

1222
00:53:31.949 --> 00:53:32.782
Okay.

1223
00:53:33.972 --> 00:53:35.972
I'll check the breakers.

1224
00:53:37.359 --> 00:53:39.371
Hey, Sue, do you wanna help me?

1225
00:53:39.371 --> 00:53:40.709
- Fuck you, dish.

1226
00:53:40.709 --> 00:53:41.542
Allow me.

1227
00:53:41.542 --> 00:53:44.132
I'm the only one who can do it.

1228
00:53:44.132 --> 00:53:45.882
- How could I forget.

1229
00:53:54.644 --> 00:53:56.894
- Daemon, you want a drink?

1230
00:53:58.075 --> 00:53:59.408
- No. Thank you.

1231
00:54:00.629 --> 00:54:01.462
I'm good.

1232
00:54:06.258 --> 00:54:08.964
- How's the fire going?

1233
00:54:08.964 --> 00:54:10.714
- [Daemon] It's good.

1234
00:54:13.768 --> 00:54:15.312
(loud crackling)

1235
00:54:15.312 --> 00:54:17.145
- What's that?
(tense music)


1236
00:54:17.145 --> 00:54:18.062
- Stay put.

1237
00:54:20.346 --> 00:54:21.614
I'm gonna go check it out.

1238
00:54:21.614 --> 00:54:23.649
- What? You're gonna go alone?

1239
00:54:23.649 --> 00:54:24.516
- I'll be right back.

1240
00:54:24.516 --> 00:54:27.516
(doorbell tinkling)

1241
00:54:29.023 --> 00:54:30.741
(insects chirping)

1242
00:54:30.741 --> 00:54:33.661
(suspenseful music)

1243
00:54:33.661 --> 00:54:36.994
(electricity crackling)

1244
00:55:03.939 --> 00:55:06.776
(doorbell tinkling)

1245
00:55:06.776 --> 00:55:07.609
- What?

1246
00:55:09.044 --> 00:55:11.764
What, don't tell him he's
fucking dead now too.


1247
00:55:11.764 --> 00:55:15.016
No fucking way, man, no fucking way.

1248
00:55:15.016 --> 00:55:16.707
What the fuck are we gonna do?

1249
00:55:16.707 --> 00:55:17.790
- Wait.

1250
00:55:17.790 --> 00:55:18.623
- [Cooper] Fuck!

1251
00:55:18.623 --> 00:55:20.372
(doorbell tinkling)

1252
00:55:20.372 --> 00:55:22.547
(panting) Fuck.

1253
00:55:22.547 --> 00:55:24.004
- Hey!

1254
00:55:24.004 --> 00:55:24.837
Hey.

1255
00:55:27.121 --> 00:55:28.292
Get your shit together.

1256
00:55:28.292 --> 00:55:29.125
Look.

1257
00:55:30.507 --> 00:55:32.734
Look, Leon's coming back.

1258
00:55:32.734 --> 00:55:34.668
He's gotta get help. 
I can feel it.

1259
00:55:34.668 --> 00:55:35.733
If there really is somebody out there

1260
00:55:35.733 --> 00:55:37.284
and they're trying to do something to us,

1261
00:55:37.284 --> 00:55:40.441
we need to stick together,
keep our shit together.


1262
00:55:40.441 --> 00:55:42.833
We gotta be ready, all right?

1263
00:55:42.833 --> 00:55:45.041
- What if they're already
in here then what?


1264
00:55:45.041 --> 00:55:47.400
- That's why we need weapons
and we need to think fast.


1265
00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:50.392
But don't worry, 
Leon's coming back.

1266
00:55:50.392 --> 00:55:51.512
- Leon?

1267
00:55:51.512 --> 00:55:53.239
What if Leon's the one behind all this?

1268
00:55:53.239 --> 00:55:54.662
- Hey, don't think like that.

1269
00:55:54.662 --> 00:55:56.329
- He's fucking crazy.

1270
00:55:56.329 --> 00:55:57.348
He's a loon.

1271
00:55:57.348 --> 00:55:58.479
He's the only one that wasn't here

1272
00:55:58.479 --> 00:56:00.097
when we found Gwen and Diane.

1273
00:56:00.097 --> 00:56:01.982
He's the only clear suspect.

1274
00:56:01.982 --> 00:56:04.224
He's the one that told us
to check the breaker box.


1275
00:56:04.224 --> 00:56:05.618
He probably fucked with it.

1276
00:56:05.618 --> 00:56:07.704
And we were all together all night long

1277
00:56:07.704 --> 00:56:09.040
except for when you two went upstairs

1278
00:56:09.040 --> 00:56:10.571
to have your little chat.

1279
00:56:10.571 --> 00:56:12.624
- (chuckles) I don't care.

1280
00:56:12.624 --> 00:56:13.457
- You don't care?

1281
00:56:13.457 --> 00:56:14.290
- No.
- You don't care.


1282
00:56:14.290 --> 00:56:15.498
- No, I don't care.
- Fuck.


1283
00:56:15.498 --> 00:56:16.469
- For all, I know
you could be the one

1284
00:56:16.469 --> 00:56:18.154
that's behind all this.

1285
00:56:18.154 --> 00:56:20.308
- You think I could be
capable of this shit?


1286
00:56:20.308 --> 00:56:22.117
- Obviously not. 
That's my point.

1287
00:56:22.117 --> 00:56:23.836
We have to stay positive.

1288
00:56:23.836 --> 00:56:24.669
- Positive?

1289
00:56:24.669 --> 00:56:25.824
- Yes.
- Stay positive.


1290
00:56:25.824 --> 00:56:26.762
- Yes.
- That's what we're gonna do.


1291
00:56:26.762 --> 00:56:27.595
Stay positive.

1292
00:56:27.595 --> 00:56:29.179
- Okay fine.

1293
00:56:29.179 --> 00:56:31.922
You can stay here and wallow
in your alcoholic paranoia


1294
00:56:31.922 --> 00:56:34.824
and self pity, but I'm
gonna go find some weapons.


1295
00:56:34.824 --> 00:56:35.657
- What about Val?

1296
00:56:35.657 --> 00:56:37.199
- [Daemon] I'm taking her with me.

1297
00:56:37.199 --> 00:56:39.864
- You guys are just gonna
leave me here, alone?


1298
00:56:39.864 --> 00:56:42.726
- You don't have to be.
(doorbell tinkling)


1299
00:56:42.726 --> 00:56:43.852
- Fuck it.

1300
00:56:43.852 --> 00:56:44.685
I'll stay.

1301
00:56:46.076 --> 00:56:49.076
(doorbell tinkling)

1302
00:56:53.088 --> 00:56:55.192
- [Valerie] You want me
to just grab anything?


1303
00:56:55.192 --> 00:56:56.025
- Yeah.

1304
00:56:57.105 --> 00:57:01.110
Anything that's hard and
can take somebody down.


1305
00:57:01.110 --> 00:57:03.963
- I don't see anything good.

1306
00:57:03.963 --> 00:57:05.546
- Can use anything.

1307
00:57:11.905 --> 00:57:14.770
- Wait, I know where there's something.

1308
00:57:14.770 --> 00:57:15.603
- Okay.

1309
00:57:19.303 --> 00:57:21.970
(keys jangling)

1310
00:57:23.804 --> 00:57:25.582
Does it have any bullets?

1311
00:57:25.582 --> 00:57:27.701
(gun clicking)

1312
00:57:27.701 --> 00:57:28.534
Perfect.

1313
00:57:31.511 --> 00:57:33.220
- What do you want
me to do with it?

1314
00:57:33.220 --> 00:57:34.835
- I want you to hold it.

1315
00:57:34.835 --> 00:57:36.056
I don't trust that bartender guy.

1316
00:57:36.056 --> 00:57:40.236
And I don't know, maybe we
shouldn't trust Leon either.


1317
00:57:40.236 --> 00:57:42.054
- Maybe you should carry it.

1318
00:57:42.054 --> 00:57:42.887
- No.

1319
00:57:43.792 --> 00:57:45.368
I want you to have it.

1320
00:57:45.368 --> 00:57:48.176
Look, I have enough weapons in this bag.

1321
00:57:48.176 --> 00:57:49.593
This is a backup.

1322
00:57:50.454 --> 00:57:53.287
If anything bad happens, we shoot,

1323
00:57:55.134 --> 00:57:56.217
or you shoot.

1324
00:58:02.129 --> 00:58:02.962
Hey.

1325
00:58:04.467 --> 00:58:08.272
Hey, I won't let anything
bad happen to you.


1326
00:58:08.272 --> 00:58:09.105
Okay?

1327
00:58:10.651 --> 00:58:11.734
You trust me?

1328
00:58:14.760 --> 00:58:15.593
- Yes.

1329
00:58:16.892 --> 00:58:18.554
- Good.

1330
00:58:18.554 --> 00:58:20.399
Now hide the gun.

1331
00:58:20.399 --> 00:58:23.149
(bag clattering)

1332
00:58:25.949 --> 00:58:28.044
- I got something for you, Leon, huh?

1333
00:58:28.044 --> 00:58:29.664
(grunts) Yeah.

1334
00:58:29.664 --> 00:58:30.773
Wanna fuck with me?

1335
00:58:30.773 --> 00:58:33.398
No, fuck with me no how.

1336
00:58:33.398 --> 00:58:34.247
(grunts)

1337
00:58:34.247 --> 00:58:35.830
Yeah. Come on down.

1338
00:58:37.234 --> 00:58:39.853
I'll dust the plate off for you.

1339
00:58:39.853 --> 00:58:40.962
There we go, buddy.

1340
00:58:40.962 --> 00:58:42.364
(grunts)

1341
00:58:42.364 --> 00:58:45.130
(doorbell tinkling)

1342
00:58:45.130 --> 00:58:48.130
- Good. You found yourself a weapon.

1343
00:58:49.114 --> 00:58:50.697
- No thanks to you.

1344
00:58:52.194 --> 00:58:53.497
Where is she?

1345
00:58:53.497 --> 00:58:54.330
- Who?

1346
00:58:54.330 --> 00:58:55.163
- Fucking Val.

1347
00:58:55.163 --> 00:58:56.240
Where the fuck is Val?

1348
00:58:56.240 --> 00:58:58.696
- Checking on the backup generator.

1349
00:58:58.696 --> 00:59:00.125
- You sent her there alone?

1350
00:59:00.125 --> 00:59:01.602
- She'll be all right.

1351
00:59:01.602 --> 00:59:04.519
(items clattering)

1352
00:59:08.610 --> 00:59:11.443
(starter revving)

1353
00:59:18.568 --> 00:59:19.981
(hand thudding)
- Ow.


1354
00:59:19.981 --> 00:59:21.763
- [Cooper] Did you find anything good?

1355
00:59:21.763 --> 00:59:23.096
- [Daemon] Yeah.

1356
00:59:25.738 --> 00:59:27.217
- This for?

1357
00:59:27.217 --> 00:59:28.574
- [Daemon] Flame thrower?

1358
00:59:28.574 --> 00:59:29.948
- Flame thrower?

1359
00:59:29.948 --> 00:59:31.948
- Yeah. A flame thrower.

1360
00:59:35.981 --> 00:59:39.682
- (scoffs) Yeah, a flame thrower, great.

1361
00:59:39.682 --> 00:59:40.876
Fucking spray butter flame thrower.

1362
00:59:40.876 --> 00:59:42.421
You saved us, bro.

1363
00:59:42.421 --> 00:59:43.254
Great job.

1364
00:59:50.526 --> 00:59:51.359
What?

1365
00:59:52.262 --> 00:59:54.531
- I think you need to chill out.

1366
00:59:54.531 --> 00:59:56.242
- (chuckles) I'm perfectly
fine with my attitude.


1367
00:59:56.242 --> 00:59:57.410
Thank you very much.

1368
00:59:57.410 --> 00:59:58.660
- You're drunk.

1369
00:59:59.970 --> 01:00:01.899
- Thanks, I didn't notice.

1370
01:00:01.899 --> 01:00:03.282
You know what?

1371
01:00:03.282 --> 01:00:04.115
I'm starting to think

1372
01:00:04.115 --> 01:00:07.391
that maybe you had something
to do with all this.


1373
01:00:07.391 --> 01:00:08.390
- Excuse me.

1374
01:00:08.390 --> 01:00:09.736
- (chuckles) I know it's funny, huh?

1375
01:00:09.736 --> 01:00:12.210
But just go with me for a second.

1376
01:00:12.210 --> 01:00:13.559
None of us had ever met Leon before

1377
01:00:13.559 --> 01:00:16.006
until you brought him up last night.

1378
01:00:16.006 --> 01:00:18.827
That's when shit started going downhill.

1379
01:00:18.827 --> 01:00:20.287
- And your point?

1380
01:00:20.287 --> 01:00:23.426
- My point, sir, is that you guys

1381
01:00:23.426 --> 01:00:26.379
have got some kind of
weird little plan going on.


1382
01:00:26.379 --> 01:00:29.791
You've got all of us together
up here for some reason.


1383
01:00:29.791 --> 01:00:31.624
Maybe it's money or...

1384
01:00:32.986 --> 01:00:34.141
money, I don't know.

1385
01:00:34.141 --> 01:00:35.501
I don't have it figured out yet,

1386
01:00:35.501 --> 01:00:38.751
but you got some kind of little scheme.

1387
01:00:42.510 --> 01:00:44.010
- Congratulations.

1388
01:00:44.932 --> 01:00:45.931
You caught me.

1389
01:00:45.931 --> 01:00:47.645
(doorbell tinkling)
(tense music)


1390
01:00:47.645 --> 01:00:49.126
- Leon, are you okay?

1391
01:00:49.126 --> 01:00:50.950
- I told you. He fucking did it.

1392
01:00:50.950 --> 01:00:52.366
- [Daemon] What the fuck are you doing?

1393
01:00:52.366 --> 01:00:55.141
- Which one of you fuckers
cut my brake lines?


1394
01:00:55.141 --> 01:00:56.136
- Whoa, whoa.

1395
01:00:56.136 --> 01:00:56.969
Calm down, brother.

1396
01:00:56.969 --> 01:00:59.055
We already got one
loose cannon here, okay?


1397
01:00:59.055 --> 01:01:00.067
What happened?

1398
01:01:00.067 --> 01:01:01.932
- Rode off a fucking cliff.

1399
01:01:01.932 --> 01:01:03.640
- Looks like you
fucked up your arm, bro.

1400
01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:05.132
- [Leon] I don't
give a fuck about that.

1401
01:01:05.132 --> 01:01:07.005
I want some fucking answers right now.

1402
01:01:07.005 --> 01:01:08.262
- You want some fucking answers?

1403
01:01:08.262 --> 01:01:09.838
I want some fucking answers too.

1404
01:01:09.838 --> 01:01:12.582
- Look, nobody's getting any answers

1405
01:01:12.582 --> 01:01:15.265
with your arm like that.

1406
01:01:15.265 --> 01:01:16.833
Let me help you fix it.

1407
01:01:16.833 --> 01:01:17.666
All right?

1408
01:01:19.010 --> 01:01:19.843
Come on.

1409
01:01:24.330 --> 01:01:25.663
Ah, there we go.

1410
01:01:27.139 --> 01:01:29.697
(Leon gasps and grunts)
Oh.


1411
01:01:29.697 --> 01:01:32.148
Did you drink all the alcohol?

1412
01:01:32.148 --> 01:01:34.315
- Plead the fifth, fucker.

1413
01:01:35.169 --> 01:01:36.443
- Stay put.

1414
01:01:36.443 --> 01:01:39.110
I'm gonna get the first aid kit.

1415
01:01:45.028 --> 01:01:47.453
- You got a fucking problem?

1416
01:01:47.453 --> 01:01:49.203
- I don't know, do I?

1417
01:01:50.562 --> 01:01:52.979
(Leon sighs)

1418
01:01:55.277 --> 01:01:56.854
- What happened to the others?

1419
01:01:56.854 --> 01:01:59.589
- Well, Lucas went to
check the breaker box.


1420
01:01:59.589 --> 01:02:02.447
Val went to see if there's
a backup generator.


1421
01:02:02.447 --> 01:02:03.475
And now Lucas is fried

1422
01:02:03.475 --> 01:02:05.962
and we still haven't heard back from Val.

1423
01:02:05.962 --> 01:02:07.335
All start it happening
right about the same time


1424
01:02:07.335 --> 01:02:09.170
you showed up.

1425
01:02:09.170 --> 01:02:10.833
Funny that, huh?

1426
01:02:10.833 --> 01:02:12.291
- Funny, yeah.

1427
01:02:12.291 --> 01:02:13.518
I got... (hisses)

1428
01:02:13.518 --> 01:02:14.351
- Easy.

1429
01:02:15.457 --> 01:02:17.124
- I got one for you.

1430
01:02:18.242 --> 01:02:20.435
Just riding down the hill on my bike

1431
01:02:20.435 --> 01:02:22.680
to help you fuckers,

1432
01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:26.275
go to use my brakes and
realize I don't have any.


1433
01:02:26.275 --> 01:02:27.997
Funny, huh?

1434
01:02:27.997 --> 01:02:31.677
- (scoffs) Maybe it was just your bike.

1435
01:02:31.677 --> 01:02:33.474
- I take care of my bike.

1436
01:02:33.474 --> 01:02:36.719
- Yeah, well maybe, just maybe,

1437
01:02:36.719 --> 01:02:38.714
you didn't even wreck your bike.

1438
01:02:38.714 --> 01:02:39.547
- Yeah.

1439
01:02:40.488 --> 01:02:43.674
I just fucking broke my arm
just to fuck with you, huh?


1440
01:02:43.674 --> 01:02:45.990
- Don't listen to him, Leon.

1441
01:02:45.990 --> 01:02:46.904
He's drunk.

1442
01:02:46.904 --> 01:02:49.104
- My drunkenness has
nothing to do with this.


1443
01:02:49.104 --> 01:02:51.639
- Well, what the fuck
are you insinuating then?


1444
01:02:51.639 --> 01:02:53.812
- Exactly what you think I'm insinuating.

1445
01:02:53.812 --> 01:02:55.309
I think you fucking did it.

1446
01:02:55.309 --> 01:02:56.549
- Me. Yeah.

1447
01:02:56.549 --> 01:02:57.913
- Just sit still.

1448
01:02:57.913 --> 01:02:59.651
Don't take it personally.

1449
01:02:59.651 --> 01:03:02.068
He just got done accusing me and Val.

1450
01:03:02.068 --> 01:03:05.081
- Well, now that I believe.

1451
01:03:05.081 --> 01:03:06.110
- What?

1452
01:03:06.110 --> 01:03:08.950
- You two do make the perfect
little team, don't you?


1453
01:03:08.950 --> 01:03:12.091
- See, that's what I fucking said.

1454
01:03:12.091 --> 01:03:14.300
- I don't care
what either of you think.

1455
01:03:14.300 --> 01:03:16.708
All I know is that I'm
not gonna die tonight.


1456
01:03:16.708 --> 01:03:18.625
- I second that notion.

1457
01:03:23.821 --> 01:03:24.937
- What?

1458
01:03:24.937 --> 01:03:26.861
- Can I ask you something, Leon?

1459
01:03:26.861 --> 01:03:29.283
Why did you get arrested?

1460
01:03:29.283 --> 01:03:31.582
Story Diane told was that the,

1461
01:03:31.582 --> 01:03:33.177
they put you away for murder.

1462
01:03:33.177 --> 01:03:34.873
- This is not the time.

1463
01:03:34.873 --> 01:03:36.812
- No, you're right.

1464
01:03:36.812 --> 01:03:38.416
I went to prison for manslaughter

1465
01:03:38.416 --> 01:03:40.370
after a guy tried killing me.

1466
01:03:40.370 --> 01:03:43.446
- (chuckles) Yeah, he tried killing you?

1467
01:03:43.446 --> 01:03:44.569
- [Daemon] You don't have to tell us.

1468
01:03:44.569 --> 01:03:46.319
- No, it's good, man.

1469
01:03:49.350 --> 01:03:50.935
So when I was younger,

1470
01:03:50.935 --> 01:03:52.352
I was at this bar

1471
01:03:53.612 --> 01:03:54.990
and I met this girl.

1472
01:03:54.990 --> 01:03:55.964
(people chattering)

1473
01:03:55.964 --> 01:03:59.047
(somber piano music)

1474
01:04:17.113 --> 01:04:20.446
(pool balls clattering)

1475
01:04:51.374 --> 01:04:53.110
Hey, what do you got on tap?

1476
01:04:53.110 --> 01:04:55.187
You got any good IPAs?

1477
01:04:55.187 --> 01:04:56.770
I'll have that one.

1478
01:04:58.656 --> 01:04:59.931
Hello.

1479
01:04:59.931 --> 01:05:00.764
- Hey.

1480
01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:05.276
- Is anyone sitting here?

1481
01:05:05.276 --> 01:05:07.631
- Um, no, go ahead.

1482
01:05:07.631 --> 01:05:09.637
- I pretty much come
here every Friday night.


1483
01:05:09.637 --> 01:05:11.106
I've never seen you here before.

1484
01:05:11.106 --> 01:05:12.189
What's your name?

1485
01:05:12.189 --> 01:05:13.022
- Penny.

1486
01:05:13.022 --> 01:05:15.189
- Penny, nice to meet you.

1487
01:05:17.379 --> 01:05:18.212
Thank you.

1488
01:05:27.947 --> 01:05:31.560
I've been coming here
since like 19 aught two.


1489
01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:33.523
Not allowed to cross
the street or something?


1490
01:05:33.523 --> 01:05:34.538
- Something like that.

1491
01:05:34.538 --> 01:05:35.538
- Yeah? Huh.

1492
01:05:39.567 --> 01:05:40.861
Hey, don't go crossing the street.

1493
01:05:40.861 --> 01:05:42.094
I'll be right back.

1494
01:05:42.094 --> 01:05:43.344
- [Penny] Okay.

1495
01:05:51.518 --> 01:05:52.351
(glass thuds)

1496
01:05:52.351 --> 01:05:53.309
- What the fuck you
think think you're doing?


1497
01:05:53.309 --> 01:05:54.392
- I didn't do

1498
01:05:54.392 --> 01:05:55.225
anything wrong!
- That's fucking bullshit.


1499
01:05:55.225 --> 01:05:56.558
He's a dead man.

1500
01:05:58.753 --> 01:06:01.503
(door squeaking)

1501
01:06:02.961 --> 01:06:03.794
(door thuds)

1502
01:06:03.794 --> 01:06:04.880
(Leon sighs)

1503
01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:07.380
(Leon grunts)

1504
01:06:09.176 --> 01:06:10.509
- What the fuck?

1505
01:06:11.417 --> 01:06:12.430
(door squeaking)

1506
01:06:12.430 --> 01:06:13.448
- No, Will, what the fuck

1507
01:06:13.448 --> 01:06:16.208
do you think you're doing?
- Fucking bitch!


1508
01:06:16.208 --> 01:06:19.028
(blade clicks)

1509
01:06:19.028 --> 01:06:19.861
(man grunts)

1510
01:06:19.861 --> 01:06:20.694
- What do you think you're doing?

1511
01:06:20.694 --> 01:06:22.050
I didn't do anything wrong.

1512
01:06:22.050 --> 01:06:23.506
No, get the fuck away from him.

1513
01:06:23.506 --> 01:06:25.596
Get the fuck of him!
(man grunts)


1514
01:06:25.596 --> 01:06:28.429
(Penny screaming)

1515
01:06:40.279 --> 01:06:42.277
- And so they arrested me.

1516
01:06:42.277 --> 01:06:44.011
Locked me up.

1517
01:06:44.011 --> 01:06:46.594
Gave me five years for man two.

1518
01:06:47.664 --> 01:06:48.497
The end.

1519
01:06:50.377 --> 01:06:54.208
- (chuckles) Well...

1520
01:06:54.208 --> 01:06:57.375
That's some story you got there, Leon.

1521
01:06:58.479 --> 01:07:02.979
Seems like you're a guy
that's capable of quite a bit.


1522
01:07:03.909 --> 01:07:05.791
Maybe a person who's got some
things that have happened


1523
01:07:05.791 --> 01:07:09.390
in his past he's not too proud of.

1524
01:07:09.390 --> 01:07:13.223
Things that maybe he
doesn't quite understand.


1525
01:07:14.265 --> 01:07:17.537
Kinda things that make a person

1526
01:07:17.537 --> 01:07:22.537
lose his mind and wanna kill
a bunch of innocent people.


1527
01:07:22.607 --> 01:07:24.257
- Keep fucking talkin'.

1528
01:07:24.257 --> 01:07:25.922
- [Cooper] What are you gonna do?

1529
01:07:25.922 --> 01:07:26.880
Kill me?

1530
01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:29.309
- Keep pushing my buttons, mother fucker.

1531
01:07:29.309 --> 01:07:30.408
- Oh, I'll pushing 'em.

1532
01:07:30.408 --> 01:07:32.419
I'll push 'em all night.

1533
01:07:32.419 --> 01:07:34.109

1537

Hey, man.

1538
01:07:39.266 --> 01:07:40.099
- Oh, no, let him go.

1539
01:07:40.099 --> 01:07:40.932
What's he gonna do,

1540
01:07:40.932 --> 01:07:41.765
kill me, huh?
- Shut up.


1541
01:07:41.765 --> 01:07:43.031
- Wants?
- Stop it.


1542
01:07:43.031 --> 01:07:44.792
- Fucking yeah.
- Stop it.


1543
01:07:44.792 --> 01:07:46.003
Need you guys to keep it together

1544
01:07:46.003 --> 01:07:47.342
just until morning, okay?

1545
01:07:47.342 --> 01:07:49.167
Just until morning.

1546
01:07:49.167 --> 01:07:50.734
All right?

1547
01:07:50.734 --> 01:07:51.817
Truce. Truce.

1548
01:07:54.387 --> 01:07:55.387
Shake on it.

1549
01:07:56.603 --> 01:07:59.603
(tense eerie music)

1550
01:08:15.533 --> 01:08:17.526
See, it's not so hard.

1551
01:08:17.526 --> 01:08:19.359
(Leon and Cooper sighing)

1552
01:08:19.359 --> 01:08:22.986
(bottle shattering)
(eerie music)


1553
01:08:22.986 --> 01:08:23.819
- Hey stop!

1554
01:08:23.819 --> 01:08:24.652
- Guy's fucking...

1555
01:08:24.652 --> 01:08:25.485
- Whoa, whoa, we don't wanna
- If you're all gonna turn...


1556
01:08:25.485 --> 01:08:26.318
- [Daemon] do that, man.

1557
01:08:26.318 --> 01:08:27.401
- What's...

1558
01:08:27.401 --> 01:08:28.234
- [Daemon] Hey.

1559
01:08:28.234 --> 01:08:29.067
- Hey, stop!

1560
01:08:29.067 --> 01:08:30.023
- Hey, you guys!

1561
01:08:30.023 --> 01:08:31.259
(Leon grunts)
Stop!


1562
01:08:31.259 --> 01:08:34.842
(Cooper and Leon grunting)

1563
01:08:37.090 --> 01:08:40.090
(suspenseful music)

1564
01:08:51.016 --> 01:08:52.564
Oh my God.

1565
01:08:52.564 --> 01:08:54.731
- God Dammit!

1566
01:09:02.700 --> 01:09:03.533
- Hey.

1567
01:09:08.618 --> 01:09:10.201
- Gimme that.
- Hey!


1568
01:09:11.158 --> 01:09:12.153
- You saw what he did.

1569
01:09:12.153 --> 01:09:14.023
He attacked me.

1570
01:09:14.023 --> 01:09:16.793
I did what I had to do.
- Don't move.


1571
01:09:16.793 --> 01:09:20.481
- Just calm down. Just calm down, Val.

1572
01:09:20.481 --> 01:09:21.314
- [Valerie] Please stop!

1573
01:09:21.314 --> 01:09:22.661
- Val.

1574
01:09:22.661 --> 01:09:24.480
Just calm down.

1575
01:09:24.480 --> 01:09:27.539
Just calm down.
- Please stop.


1576
01:09:27.539 --> 01:09:28.544
- Val.

1577
01:09:28.544 --> 01:09:33.544
(gun firing)
(eerie music)


1578
01:09:33.757 --> 01:09:35.090
Fuck.

1579
01:09:35.090 --> 01:09:37.840
(Valerie crying)

1580
01:09:43.703 --> 01:09:44.536
- Oh no.

1581
01:09:47.977 --> 01:09:50.616
Cooper.
(somber music)


1582
01:09:50.616 --> 01:09:51.824
- [Cooper] God.

1583
01:09:51.824 --> 01:09:54.066
- Coop?
- I want to...


1584
01:09:54.066 --> 01:09:54.983
Please God.

1585
01:09:56.153 --> 01:09:56.986
Help me.

1586
01:09:58.070 --> 01:10:00.290
- I'm sorry, I
don't know what to do.

1587
01:10:00.290 --> 01:10:01.126
What do I do?

1588
01:10:01.126 --> 01:10:04.007
I don't know what to do. (crying)

1589
01:10:04.007 --> 01:10:05.652
I'm sorry, I don't know what to do.

1590
01:10:05.652 --> 01:10:07.698
- [Cooper] I don't wanna die.

1591
01:10:07.698 --> 01:10:09.198
- It's okay, Coop.

1592
01:10:11.085 --> 01:10:14.046
(Cooper exhales heavily)

1593
01:10:14.046 --> 01:10:19.046
(somber music)
(Valerie sobbing)


1594
01:10:32.093 --> 01:10:33.323
(Daemon groans)

1595
01:10:33.323 --> 01:10:35.043
Oh, thank God.

1596
01:10:35.043 --> 01:10:37.492
- What?
- Are you okay?


1597
01:10:37.492 --> 01:10:38.325
- No.

1598
01:10:39.442 --> 01:10:40.694
(Valerie crying)

1599
01:10:40.694 --> 01:10:41.527
What happened?

1600
01:10:41.527 --> 01:10:44.500
- I killed (indistinct).

1601
01:10:44.500 --> 01:10:45.583
I killed him.

1602
01:10:46.715 --> 01:10:47.923
- Who?

1603
01:10:47.923 --> 01:10:49.345
- Leon, babe.

1604
01:10:49.345 --> 01:10:50.238
I shot him myself.

1605
01:10:50.238 --> 01:10:51.988
I think I killed him.

1606
01:10:54.010 --> 01:10:55.538
(Daemon groaning)

1607
01:10:55.538 --> 01:10:58.288
(Valerie crying)

1608
01:11:06.578 --> 01:11:07.411
- Uh.

1609
01:11:09.778 --> 01:11:12.869
- I wanna, I
wanna get out of here.

1610
01:11:12.869 --> 01:11:15.452
(Daemon sighs)

1611
01:11:17.610 --> 01:11:19.204
(insects chirping)

1612
01:11:19.204 --> 01:11:20.924
Where are we going?

1613
01:11:20.924 --> 01:11:22.709
- I know of a
place that we can go.

1614
01:11:22.709 --> 01:11:24.405
- Where is it?

1615
01:11:24.405 --> 01:11:26.660
- It's where my
mom used to take me.

1616
01:11:26.660 --> 01:11:27.493
Trust me.

1617
01:11:35.537 --> 01:11:38.204
- Daemon, where the hell are we?

1618
01:11:39.074 --> 01:11:40.359
- Don't worry.

1619
01:11:40.359 --> 01:11:42.241
I know where to go.

1620
01:11:42.241 --> 01:11:43.074
- I don't like it out here.

1621
01:11:43.074 --> 01:11:44.399
I think we should've just stayed.

1622
01:11:44.399 --> 01:11:48.822
- [Daemon] It's a lot safer
than where we just were.


1623
01:11:48.822 --> 01:11:51.054
- I just wanna go home.

1624
01:11:51.054 --> 01:11:52.839
- Just follow me.

1625
01:11:52.839 --> 01:11:56.070
- I'm (crying) sorry if
you're getting annoyed by me-


1626
01:11:56.070 --> 01:11:58.042
- I'm not annoyed. Fuck!

1627
01:11:58.042 --> 01:11:58.875
(bird chirping)

1628
01:11:58.875 --> 01:12:01.381
I just... no matter
what I say or do,

1629
01:12:01.381 --> 01:12:04.341
this shit always seems to happen to me.

1630
01:12:04.341 --> 01:12:06.806
(Daemon panting)

1631
01:12:06.806 --> 01:12:07.639
- What?

1632
01:12:09.387 --> 01:12:10.970
- It's complicated.

1633
01:12:19.584 --> 01:12:20.417
This way.

1634
01:12:27.898 --> 01:12:28.984
- What the fuck, Daemon.

1635
01:12:28.984 --> 01:12:30.475
These are the caves.

1636
01:12:30.475 --> 01:12:32.183
What are we doing here?

1637
01:12:32.183 --> 01:12:34.515
- It's the perfect place to hide.

1638
01:12:34.515 --> 01:12:35.824
If anyone sticks their
head around the corner,


1639
01:12:35.824 --> 01:12:37.350
we'll blow it off.

1640
01:12:37.350 --> 01:12:38.590
Plus we know these parts.

1641
01:12:38.590 --> 01:12:40.635
- I think that's a bad idea.

1642
01:12:40.635 --> 01:12:42.933
I think we should just head back.

1643
01:12:42.933 --> 01:12:45.281
He's not in there anymore.

1644
01:12:45.281 --> 01:12:47.203
- Do you have a better idea?

1645
01:12:47.203 --> 01:12:50.864
Look, he can't sneak up
from behind us in here.


1646
01:12:50.864 --> 01:12:52.529
We can wait it out until morning

1647
01:12:52.529 --> 01:12:53.554
and then we'll go for help.

1648
01:12:53.554 --> 01:12:55.904
We'll be safe in here.

1649
01:12:55.904 --> 01:12:59.821
Now, gimme the keys. (panting)

1650
01:13:04.694 --> 01:13:07.361
(keys jangling)

1651
01:13:11.751 --> 01:13:16.751
(keys jangling)
(Daemon panting)


1652
01:13:18.596 --> 01:13:21.263
(door clanging)

1653
01:13:23.346 --> 01:13:26.096
(water dripping)

1654
01:13:41.705 --> 01:13:43.622
My phone's almost dead.

1655
01:13:44.801 --> 01:13:48.541
- Fuck, I left
mine at the fucking cabin.

1656
01:13:48.541 --> 01:13:50.355
- Fucking... it's okay.

1657
01:13:50.355 --> 01:13:51.428
(Valerie sighs)

1658
01:13:51.428 --> 01:13:52.689
We'll be safe.

1659
01:13:52.689 --> 01:13:54.022
Just stay close.

1660
01:13:55.966 --> 01:13:59.810
- [Valerie] Wait, no.
I've never been in there.


1661
01:13:59.810 --> 01:14:01.170
- Exactly.

1662
01:14:01.170 --> 01:14:03.753
He won't think to come in here.

1663
01:14:05.883 --> 01:14:06.716
What?

1664
01:14:09.272 --> 01:14:11.522
- I don't like it in there.

1665
01:14:14.038 --> 01:14:16.221
- Are you scared?

1666
01:14:16.221 --> 01:14:17.619
You do these tours all the time.

1667
01:14:17.619 --> 01:14:18.821
What's the difference?

1668
01:14:18.821 --> 01:14:20.238
- Never in there.

1669
01:14:22.353 --> 01:14:24.228
- [Daemon] Valerie.

1670
01:14:24.228 --> 01:14:25.728
- I wanna go home.

1671
01:14:27.924 --> 01:14:29.424
- Do you trust me?

1672
01:14:31.323 --> 01:14:32.980
- It's not that.

1673
01:14:32.980 --> 01:14:34.724
- Then what is it?

1674
01:14:34.724 --> 01:14:35.665
If we don't trust each other,

1675
01:14:35.665 --> 01:14:37.415
then we have nothing.

1676
01:14:42.379 --> 01:14:45.379
(Valerie sniffling)

1677
01:14:51.637 --> 01:14:56.637
(ominous music)
(water dripping)


1678
01:15:09.156 --> 01:15:09.989
It died.

1679
01:15:12.201 --> 01:15:15.558
- Then why don't
we just stay right here?

1680
01:15:15.558 --> 01:15:18.035
- No, we have to keep going.

1681
01:15:18.035 --> 01:15:19.102
- We have to get help.

1682
01:15:19.102 --> 01:15:19.973
- You are not helping

1683
01:15:19.973 --> 01:15:21.723
in this, Val.
(tense music)


1684
01:15:21.723 --> 01:15:23.563
- Daemon, you're hurting me.

1685
01:15:23.563 --> 01:15:24.396
- I am?

1686
01:15:24.396 --> 01:15:26.008
- Yes. (sighs)

1687
01:15:26.008 --> 01:15:27.068
- I'm sorry.

1688
01:15:27.068 --> 01:15:27.905
- It's okay.
- I didn't mean for-


1689
01:15:27.905 --> 01:15:29.947
- It's okay, Daemon.

1690
01:15:29.947 --> 01:15:32.530
- I'm not scared to be in here.

1691
01:15:35.331 --> 01:15:38.498
What are you most afraid of right now?

1692
01:15:41.176 --> 01:15:42.382
- Never ever waking up
(tense music)


1693
01:15:42.382 --> 01:15:45.014
in my own bed ever again.

1694
01:15:45.014 --> 01:15:45.931
- Don't be.

1695
01:15:48.147 --> 01:15:51.680
I won't let anything happen to you, Sarah.

1696
01:15:51.680 --> 01:15:52.513
Okay?

1697
01:15:55.237 --> 01:15:58.117
(Valerie crying)

1698
01:15:58.117 --> 01:15:59.357
Oh no.

1699
01:15:59.357 --> 01:16:00.307
Don't, don't cry.

1700
01:16:00.307 --> 01:16:01.296
Why are you crying?

1701
01:16:01.296 --> 01:16:03.136
- Oh, I'm sorry.

1702
01:16:03.136 --> 01:16:04.857
- No, don't apologize.

1703
01:16:04.857 --> 01:16:06.831
I don't, I'm not looking for an apology.

1704
01:16:06.831 --> 01:16:09.331
I just... I wanna be forgiven.

1705
01:16:10.908 --> 01:16:12.491
I want forgiveness.

1706
01:16:15.025 --> 01:16:17.608
I don't know why I am this way.

1707
01:16:20.368 --> 01:16:22.035
Maybe it was my dad.

1708
01:16:23.379 --> 01:16:26.584
I ever tell you about my dad?

1709
01:16:26.584 --> 01:16:27.417
- No.

1710
01:16:28.571 --> 01:16:29.988
- He worked here.

1711
01:16:33.572 --> 01:16:35.239
- Here at the lodge?

1712
01:16:36.082 --> 01:16:36.915
- Yeah.

1713
01:16:37.817 --> 01:16:39.734
He was a groundskeeper.

1714
01:16:42.293 --> 01:16:43.376
He was angry.

1715
01:16:45.170 --> 01:16:48.061
- [Judge] Please rise
when addressing the Court.


1716
01:16:48.061 --> 01:16:50.075
- [Jed] Yes, sir, your courtship.

1717
01:16:50.075 --> 01:16:51.539
- [Judge] Your Honor.

1718
01:16:51.539 --> 01:16:53.206
You can call me Ken.

1719
01:16:54.488 --> 01:16:55.922
- Where are you been?

1720
01:16:55.922 --> 01:16:56.772
- [Judge] Any attempt at humor

1721
01:16:56.772 --> 01:16:58.929
will be dealt with severely.
- I was out.


1722
01:16:58.929 --> 01:16:59.762
- [Judge] You're being sued

1723
01:16:59.762 --> 01:17:00.595
for $5000.
- By yourself?


1724
01:17:00.595 --> 01:17:02.885
- Do you consider that funny?
- I was with this girl.


1725
01:17:02.885 --> 01:17:03.718
She's nice.
- No, sir.


1726
01:17:03.718 --> 01:17:04.551
- Hm.

1727
01:17:06.176 --> 01:17:07.009
Did you go to school?

1728
01:17:07.009 --> 01:17:07.842
- [Judge] Are you represented

1729
01:17:07.842 --> 01:17:09.800
by counsel?
- Yeah.


1730
01:17:09.800 --> 01:17:12.271
(can clattering)

1731
01:17:12.271 --> 01:17:14.616
- Now, why I do that?
- Lawyer?


1732
01:17:14.616 --> 01:17:15.461
- I don't know.
- Oh no, sir.


1733
01:17:15.461 --> 01:17:16.853
- Liar!

1734
01:17:16.853 --> 01:17:18.625
- You're appearing in pro per.
- I don't.


1735
01:17:18.625 --> 01:17:20.585
- The school called.

1736
01:17:20.585 --> 01:17:21.963
You never go.

1737
01:17:21.963 --> 01:17:23.625
You never go to work.

1738
01:17:23.625 --> 01:17:26.745
You're as lazy as your fucking mom.

1739
01:17:26.745 --> 01:17:28.634
And I say that with love.

1740
01:17:28.634 --> 01:17:29.973
- [Judge] Speak for the plaintiffs,

1741
01:17:29.973 --> 01:17:31.006
so make yourselves exchange.

1742
01:17:31.006 --> 01:17:33.233
- You got anything to save for yourself?

1743
01:17:33.233 --> 01:17:34.678
- I don't like it there.
- Thank you, Your Honor.


1744
01:17:34.678 --> 01:17:36.576
(whining)

1745
01:17:36.576 --> 01:17:38.896
- Well, that's life, kid.

1746
01:17:38.896 --> 01:17:40.854
You're not supposed to like it.

1747
01:17:40.854 --> 01:17:42.408
- [Judge] You appear today.

1748
01:17:42.408 --> 01:17:43.769
- They look at me weird.
- I have persuaded them


1749
01:17:43.769 --> 01:17:44.857
to come to court.
- That's because


1750
01:17:44.857 --> 01:17:46.993
you look stupid.

1751
01:17:46.993 --> 01:17:48.219
That's why your mother left.

1752
01:17:48.219 --> 01:17:51.005
- [Attorney] Wreaked by this
criminally careless family.


1753
01:17:51.005 --> 01:17:53.011
- Now, come on. 
I'm just kidding.

1754
01:17:53.011 --> 01:17:55.589
Would you go grab me another beer, kiddo.

1755
01:17:55.589 --> 01:17:56.939
- Granny.
(audience laughing)


1756
01:17:56.939 --> 01:17:57.963
- [Jed] Just Granny.

1757
01:17:57.963 --> 01:18:00.963
The voters and their...
- I hate you.


1758
01:18:02.821 --> 01:18:05.952
- (grunting) Oh, you hate me, huh?

1759
01:18:05.952 --> 01:18:07.279
Is that what I heard?

1760
01:18:07.279 --> 01:18:08.494
You don't want me around here?

1761
01:18:08.494 --> 01:18:10.371
- No, that's not what I said.

1762
01:18:10.371 --> 01:18:12.468
- (chuckles) So now I'm hearing shit, huh?

1763
01:18:12.468 --> 01:18:13.301
- No.

1764
01:18:13.301 --> 01:18:14.134
- You don't want me around.

1765
01:18:14.134 --> 01:18:15.453
You think you can have all this

1766
01:18:15.453 --> 01:18:17.248
without me providing for you?

1767
01:18:17.248 --> 01:18:20.373
- [Daemon] No, 
I didn't say that.

1768
01:18:20.373 --> 01:18:21.551
- Hell with that.

1769
01:18:21.551 --> 01:18:22.718
Get over here.

1770
01:18:25.781 --> 01:18:26.875
- [Daemon] No, please!

1771
01:18:26.875 --> 01:18:27.870
- Nope, you asked for this.

1772
01:18:27.870 --> 01:18:28.703
- [Daemon] Please!

1773
01:18:28.703 --> 01:18:29.536
- Shut up!

1774
01:18:31.979 --> 01:18:34.729
(birds chirping)

1775
01:18:36.558 --> 01:18:37.391
Come on.

1776
01:18:46.900 --> 01:18:49.628
(water dripping)

1777
01:18:49.628 --> 01:18:51.378
- Yeah, it was tough.

1778
01:18:53.841 --> 01:18:55.617
- I'm so sorry.

1779
01:18:55.617 --> 01:18:56.450
- Why?

1780
01:18:58.007 --> 01:18:59.750
You didn't know.

1781
01:18:59.750 --> 01:19:02.083
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

1782
01:19:03.449 --> 01:19:05.080
It's just family shit, you know?

1783
01:19:05.080 --> 01:19:06.080
- It's okay.

1784
01:19:06.960 --> 01:19:08.710
I just wanna go home.

1785
01:19:17.830 --> 01:19:18.942
(gun clicking)

1786
01:19:18.942 --> 01:19:21.692
(Valerie crying)

1787
01:19:26.727 --> 01:19:28.406
- Don't worry.

1788
01:19:28.406 --> 01:19:29.823
It's not for you.

1789
01:19:31.027 --> 01:19:34.099
- You're not letting me go home.

1790
01:19:34.099 --> 01:19:36.516
- No, I kinda want you to go.

1791
01:19:39.019 --> 01:19:41.109
- You're not coming with me?

1792
01:19:41.109 --> 01:19:43.576
(Daemon scoffs)

1793
01:19:43.576 --> 01:19:44.409
- I can't.

1794
01:19:47.086 --> 01:19:48.919
- We can get you help.

1795
01:19:50.263 --> 01:19:51.846
- That never works.

1796
01:19:53.095 --> 01:19:56.095
(Valerie sniffling)

1797
01:19:59.386 --> 01:20:00.469
What's wrong?

1798
01:20:05.268 --> 01:20:07.398
- I just don't like it in here.

1799
01:20:07.398 --> 01:20:09.148
This place scares me.

1800
01:20:10.147 --> 01:20:12.427
- Well, don't worry.

1801
01:20:12.427 --> 01:20:14.441
It'll all be over soon.

1802
01:20:14.441 --> 01:20:16.288
You're lucky.

1803
01:20:16.288 --> 01:20:18.288
You have a perfect life.

1804
01:20:18.288 --> 01:20:20.163
- What perfect life?

1805
01:20:20.163 --> 01:20:22.587
I just wanna go home!

1806
01:20:22.587 --> 01:20:24.656
I just wanna go.

1807
01:20:24.656 --> 01:20:25.957
We can go together.

1808
01:20:25.957 --> 01:20:28.328
We can try to fix this.

1809
01:20:28.328 --> 01:20:30.283
- I know you don't want this.

1810
01:20:30.283 --> 01:20:32.216
No one wants this.

1811
01:20:32.216 --> 01:20:33.496
But in reality...

1812
01:20:33.496 --> 01:20:35.163
You have everything.

1813
01:20:36.207 --> 01:20:37.790
And I have nothing.

1814
01:20:38.947 --> 01:20:41.838
I don't wanna hold you back anymore.

1815
01:20:41.838 --> 01:20:44.387
- What is there here for you?

1816
01:20:44.387 --> 01:20:45.970
Go ahead and leave.

1817
01:20:46.976 --> 01:20:51.131
But you're gonna have
to do it without me.

1818
01:20:51.131 --> 01:20:52.129
(gun clicking)

1819
01:20:52.129 --> 01:20:52.962
- No, Daemon!

1820
01:20:52.962 --> 01:20:55.026
(gun firing)
(dramatic music)


1821
01:20:55.026 --> 01:20:59.943
No! (crying)
(tense music)


1822
01:21:02.908 --> 01:21:04.602
(Valerie crying)

1823
01:21:04.602 --> 01:21:07.685
(somber piano music)

1824
01:21:11.232 --> 01:21:12.065
No!

1825
01:21:16.453 --> 01:21:19.286
(water trickling)

1826
01:21:30.663 --> 01:21:33.413
(water dripping)

1827
01:21:50.549 --> 01:21:55.549
(gentle piano music)
(birds chirping)


1828
01:21:58.421 --> 01:22:02.594
- Yeah, you got yourself in
a bit of a situation, huh?


1829
01:22:02.594 --> 01:22:05.427
- I just don't
know how to end it.

1830
01:22:06.600 --> 01:22:09.267
- Well, you want a happy ending?

1831
01:22:10.581 --> 01:22:12.676
- Is that realistic though?

1832
01:22:12.676 --> 01:22:14.815
- Well, you got a point there.

1833
01:22:14.815 --> 01:22:16.069
I don't know.

1834
01:22:16.069 --> 01:22:18.444
I mean, it could be realistic
to have a happy ending


1835
01:22:18.444 --> 01:22:21.223
if you know what you're doing?

1836
01:22:21.223 --> 01:22:23.623
- How would you end it?

1837
01:22:23.623 --> 01:22:24.456
- Well, let's think

1838
01:22:24.456 --> 01:22:26.960
about what your character
is going through.


1839
01:22:26.960 --> 01:22:29.695
She's stuck in a tough spot.

1840
01:22:29.695 --> 01:22:31.711
She's alone. She's cold.

1841
01:22:31.711 --> 01:22:33.810
She's losing all hope.

1842
01:22:33.810 --> 01:22:35.249
But then she sees a light

1843
01:22:35.249 --> 01:22:37.332
at the end of the tunnel.

1844
01:22:38.198 --> 01:22:40.435
- She's not in a tunnel.

1845
01:22:40.435 --> 01:22:41.908
- Well, I know that.

1846
01:22:41.908 --> 01:22:43.617
It's a metaphorical tunnel.

1847
01:22:43.617 --> 01:22:44.662
Let's see.

1848
01:22:44.662 --> 01:22:46.032
Oh, I got it.

1849
01:22:46.032 --> 01:22:47.752
She breaks through the window.

1850
01:22:47.752 --> 01:22:49.200
She grabs a sheet off the bed

1851
01:22:49.200 --> 01:22:50.701
and then she rappels out the window,

1852
01:22:50.701 --> 01:22:53.951
she gets help, and she saves everybody.

1853
01:22:55.121 --> 01:22:55.954
- Forget it.

1854
01:22:55.954 --> 01:22:58.204
I'll just work on it later.

1855
01:22:59.168 --> 01:23:01.558
- What, you don't like my idea?

1856
01:23:01.558 --> 01:23:03.641
- I do, but I don't know.

1857
01:23:04.855 --> 01:23:06.355
- Hm, fair enough.

1858
01:23:11.833 --> 01:23:15.501
- Did they ever find that little girl?

1859
01:23:15.501 --> 01:23:18.168
- Little girl. 
What little girl?

1860
01:23:19.003 --> 01:23:21.238
- The one in the caves?

1861
01:23:21.238 --> 01:23:23.405
- Oh. Ah, no, no, not yet.

1862
01:23:24.735 --> 01:23:26.111
- That's so sad.

1863
01:23:26.111 --> 01:23:28.724
That's why I don't like being in there.

1864
01:23:28.724 --> 01:23:30.138
- Yeah, it's easy
to get lost in there

1865
01:23:30.138 --> 01:23:32.525
if you don't know your way around.

1866
01:23:32.525 --> 01:23:35.329
- And it's so dark and cold.

1867
01:23:35.329 --> 01:23:37.403
I don't know what I would do.

1868
01:23:37.403 --> 01:23:38.961
- Well, that's why we're gonna go tomorrow

1869
01:23:38.961 --> 01:23:40.544
and show you around so if you're ever

1870
01:23:40.544 --> 01:23:43.641
in a situation like that,
you'll know what to do.


1871
01:23:43.641 --> 01:23:46.350
- Even then, didn't
you get lost in there?

1872
01:23:46.350 --> 01:23:50.376
- (chuckles) Yeah. Just
about half a dozen times.


1873
01:23:50.376 --> 01:23:53.312
- How did you find your way out?

1874
01:23:53.312 --> 01:23:55.874
- Yeah, well the first
time was pretty tough.


1875
01:23:55.874 --> 01:23:57.890
It was so dark, it was pitch black.

1876
01:23:57.890 --> 01:23:59.487
My flashlight died.

1877
01:23:59.487 --> 01:24:01.475
Luckily I had my walkie with me.

1878
01:24:01.475 --> 01:24:03.727
I had your Uncle Charlie help me out.

1879
01:24:03.727 --> 01:24:05.573
The second time was a lot easier.

1880
01:24:05.573 --> 01:24:07.847
I just listened to the water.

1881
01:24:07.847 --> 01:24:09.727
- To the water?

1882
01:24:09.727 --> 01:24:11.087
- Yep. I just listened to the stream

1883
01:24:11.087 --> 01:24:15.467
and followed it all the
way out to the light.


1884
01:24:15.467 --> 01:24:16.790
You know, I like to think

1885
01:24:16.790 --> 01:24:20.597
that that's what that
little girl's doing now.


1886
01:24:20.597 --> 01:24:23.369
Now, if you ever find yourself
in a situation like that,


1887
01:24:23.369 --> 01:24:25.573
I want you to know that
I'll always be with you


1888
01:24:25.573 --> 01:24:26.990
even if I'm gone.

1889
01:24:30.044 --> 01:24:32.088
You'll know what to do.

1890
01:24:32.088 --> 01:24:33.921
- Listen to the water?

1891
01:24:34.991 --> 01:24:36.794
- Listen to the water.

1892
01:24:36.794 --> 01:24:37.847
Love you, kid.

1893
01:24:37.847 --> 01:24:40.499
- [Valerie] I love you too, Dad.

1894
01:24:40.499 --> 01:24:45.499
(eerie music)
(water dripping)


1895
01:24:45.789 --> 01:24:48.790
(dark suspenseful music)

1896
01:24:48.790 --> 01:24:51.623
(water trickling)

1897
01:25:00.721 --> 01:25:03.304
- [Dad] You'll know what to do.

1898
01:25:17.859 --> 01:25:20.526
(voice echoing)

1899
01:25:21.606 --> 01:25:22.439
(gate rattling)

1900
01:25:22.439 --> 01:25:25.106

1904
01:26:09.233 --> 01:26:12.066
(Valerie panting)

1905
01:26:13.066 --> 01:26:14.903
(somber music)

1906
01:26:14.903 --> 01:26:15.736
- Okay.

1907
01:26:25.937 --> 01:26:28.237
- We got a (indistinct)
- Please help me.


1908
01:26:28.237 --> 01:26:29.445
- Well, lay it down.

1909
01:26:29.445 --> 01:26:30.604
Ma'am, are you okay?
- They're all dead.


1910
01:26:30.604 --> 01:26:31.645
- [Officer] Are you okay?

1911
01:26:31.645 --> 01:26:33.076
- Thank God, thank God.

1912
01:26:33.076 --> 01:26:34.489
- Okay, all right.
(Valerie crying)


1913
01:26:34.489 --> 01:26:35.789
In my vehicle, tell me what happened.

1914
01:26:35.789 --> 01:26:37.230
(Valerie crying and stammering)

1915
01:26:37.230 --> 01:26:40.813
Can I get additional
units out here please?


1916
01:26:47.362 --> 01:26:50.431
Dispatch, I need additional units out

1917
01:26:50.431 --> 01:26:52.348
at Big Creek Road ASAP.
