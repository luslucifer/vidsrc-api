1
00:04:33.943 --> 00:04:36.945
- Heil Hitler!
- Heil Hitler!


2
00:05:01.676 --> 00:05:03.595
When I was a boy,

3
00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.597
I was fascinated
with the world.


4
00:05:11.227 --> 00:05:13.104
I wondered why nations live

5
00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:15.356
and nations die.

6
00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.108
How do you kill a nation?

7
00:05:18.233 --> 00:05:22.404
Like Germany-- it destroyed
several other nations


8
00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:26.115
before being destroyed itself
at the end of World War II.


9
00:05:26.241 --> 00:05:28.951
Even powerful empires perish.

10
00:05:29.077 --> 00:05:32.038
Where's the Roman Empire today?

11
00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.207
Or the Soviet Union?

12
00:05:35.332 --> 00:05:38.794
Nations can be destroyed
from the outside,


13
00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:41.171
by invasion and conquest,

14
00:05:41.296 --> 00:05:44.257
or they implode from within,

15
00:05:44.382 --> 00:05:47.010
by losing
what makes them distinctive.


16
00:05:51.347 --> 00:05:55.309
I wonder if that
could ever happen to America.


17
00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:05.610
When I first came to America
as a 17-year-old,


18
00:06:05.735 --> 00:06:08.988
I knew I was coming
to a special place.


19
00:06:10.531 --> 00:06:13.242
I didn't know much
about the Constitution,


20
00:06:13.367 --> 00:06:15.577
the Bill of Rights,
any of that.


21
00:06:15.703 --> 00:06:18.330
I liked it here
because I liked the people.


22
00:06:18.455 --> 00:06:20.415
I saw Americans as independent,

23
00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:23.877
hardworking, self-reliant.

24
00:06:24.002 --> 00:06:27.797
Americans are
fiercely individualistic,


25
00:06:27.922 --> 00:06:31.801
but they're also fiercely
attached to family and faith,


26
00:06:31.926 --> 00:06:35.054
to community and to country.

27
00:06:35.179 --> 00:06:37.890
That's what the national anthem
symbolizes-- and the flag--


28
00:06:38.015 --> 00:06:41.977
that we 're one country
and we 're in this together.


29
00:06:42.102 --> 00:06:45.730
This is the America
I know and love.


30
00:06:45.855 --> 00:06:48.316
But can it last?

31
00:06:50.943 --> 00:06:53.446
America was never great!

32
00:06:53.571 --> 00:06:56.281
- Slavery, genocide and war!
- There are those


33
00:06:56.407 --> 00:07:00.285
in America who want to end
the America we love.


34
00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:04.873
They believe America is defined
by class oppression...


35
00:07:04.998 --> 00:07:07.750
- Tear it down! Tear it down!
-...and white supremacy.


36
00:07:07.875 --> 00:07:10.336
They want, in Obama's phrase,

37
00:07:10.461 --> 00:07:13.005
to remake America.

38
00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:16.717
For this to happen,
America as we know it must die.


39
00:07:18.302 --> 00:07:19.720
Who will stop them?

40
00:07:21.596 --> 00:07:22.973
Wow, what a crowd!

41
00:07:23.098 --> 00:07:24.557
Billionaire
Donald Trump is hitting


42
00:07:24.682 --> 00:07:26.726
the presidential
campaign trail.


43
00:07:26.851 --> 00:07:29.645
Yep, he says
he may run for president.


44
00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:32.481
Do it. D
-Do it.

45
00:07:32.606 --> 00:07:34.942
L
-Look at me. Do it!

46
00:07:35.067 --> 00:07:37.528
Ann, which Republican candidate
has the best chance


47
00:07:37.653 --> 00:07:39.696
of winning
the general election?


48
00:07:39.821 --> 00:07:42.782
Of the declared ones,
right now, Donald Trump.


49
00:07:46.661 --> 00:07:48.162
He might be leading
the Republican ticket.


50
00:07:48.287 --> 00:07:49.664
Next...

51
00:07:49.789 --> 00:07:52.500
I know you don't believe that,
but I want to go onto...


52
00:07:52.625 --> 00:07:54.501
There's not gonna be
a President Donald Trump.


53
00:07:54.627 --> 00:07:57.087
Um... that's not gonna happen.

54
00:07:57.212 --> 00:07:59.589
Donald Trump is not going to be
president of the United States.


55
00:07:59.715 --> 00:08:01.591
- Take it to the bank.
I guarantee it. -Okay.


56
00:08:01.716 --> 00:08:02.634
All right, all right.

57
00:08:02.759 --> 00:08:07.221
Well, @realDonaldTrump,
at least I will go down


58
00:08:07.347 --> 00:08:09.557
as a president.

59
00:08:09.682 --> 00:08:11.309
Everyone had
a good laugh at Trump


60
00:08:11.434 --> 00:08:14.812
<i>but not the American people.</i>

61
00:08:14.937 --> 00:08:17.106
20,000 people
turned out last night


62
00:08:17.231 --> 00:08:19.107
at a football stadium
in Mobile, Alabama,


63
00:08:19.232 --> 00:08:21.234
to hear Republican
front-runner Donald Trump.


64
00:08:21.359 --> 00:08:23.320
Man, I feel like
a billionaire already.


65
00:08:23.445 --> 00:08:25.655
Show 'em how many people come
to these rallies!


66
00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:27.991
Turn 'em! Go ahead, turn 'em!

67
00:08:28.116 --> 00:08:30.201
Go ahead!

68
00:08:30.326 --> 00:08:33.412
Trump and his voters
had a bond.


69
00:08:33.537 --> 00:08:36.081
We have a movement
like they've never seen before.


70
00:08:36.206 --> 00:08:37.958
So, right now, we have...
Hillary's about a 75%


71
00:08:38.083 --> 00:08:39.376
or an 80% favorite.

72
00:08:39.501 --> 00:08:40.919
- We have different versions
of forecast. -That high?


73
00:08:41.044 --> 00:08:42.671
Is it fun to be
at a Trump rally?!


74
00:08:42.796 --> 00:08:45.215
I mean, is this the greatest?!

75
00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:47.300
He's just not gonna win the
general election in this mode.


76
00:08:47.425 --> 00:08:49.427
Not even close.

77
00:08:49.552 --> 00:08:51.304
The hell we can't.

78
00:08:55.766 --> 00:08:58.185
They believed Trump
would fight for their America.


79
00:08:58.310 --> 00:08:59.645
Such a nasty woman.

80
00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:01.229
So they stayed with him,

81
00:09:01.354 --> 00:09:02.939
and it drove the left nuts.

82
00:09:03.064 --> 00:09:05.316
Chaos in the streets

83
00:09:05.442 --> 00:09:06.985
at a Donald Trump rally.

84
00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:09.278
If you can get 'em out,
get 'em out.


85
00:09:09.403 --> 00:09:11.364
None of us thought
we were gonna be here.


86
00:09:11.489 --> 00:09:12.740
But we are.

87
00:09:12.865 --> 00:09:14.325
Especially her.

88
00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:17.453
Why aren't I 50 points ahead,
you might ask.


89
00:09:17.578 --> 00:09:21.039
Trump and his
supporters were in it together.


90
00:09:21.164 --> 00:09:24.959
I am your voice.

91
00:09:26.002 --> 00:09:27.378
I am with you.

92
00:09:27.503 --> 00:09:29.714
I will fight for you.

93
00:09:29.839 --> 00:09:32.341
And I will win for you.

94
00:09:32.466 --> 00:09:34.510
We will make

95
00:09:34.635 --> 00:09:38.513
America strong again.

96
00:09:38.639 --> 00:09:40.932
We will make

97
00:09:41.057 --> 00:09:43.935
America proud again.

98
00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:45.937
We will make

99
00:09:46.062 --> 00:09:49.732
America safe again.

100
00:09:49.857 --> 00:09:53.319
And we will make America
great again!


101
00:09:53.444 --> 00:09:54.320
God bless you,

102
00:09:54.445 --> 00:09:56.238
and good night!

103
00:09:56.363 --> 00:09:58.240
<i>I love you!</i>

104
00:09:58.365 --> 00:10:01.576
To be honest,
I didn't think Trump would win.


105
00:10:01.701 --> 00:10:05.622
Hillary had total control
of the Democratic machine,


106
00:10:05.747 --> 00:10:08.708
her foot on Sanders' throat,

107
00:10:08.833 --> 00:10:10.710
a sycophantic Hollywood
and media.


108
00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:15.839
How do you fight
against all that?


109
00:10:15.964 --> 00:10:19.551
From NBC News,
"Decision Night in America."


110
00:10:19.676 --> 00:10:21.386
First and foremost,
it's finally here.


111
00:10:21.511 --> 00:10:22.679
Here at the Javits Center,

112
00:10:22.804 --> 00:10:25.473
which is Hillary Clinton's
election party site.


113
00:10:25.598 --> 00:10:27.475
There's a sense
of building excitement,


114
00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:29.393
and I mean building excitement.

115
00:10:29.519 --> 00:10:30.770
No, this is conservatives
waking up


116
00:10:30.895 --> 00:10:32.229
and smelling the coffee and go,

117
00:10:32.355 --> 00:10:33.898
"Oh, right, our candidate
was a moron."


118
00:10:34.023 --> 00:10:35.566
And we have
our first projection


119
00:10:35.691 --> 00:10:37.985
that Donald Trump
will win in Kentucky.


120
00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:39.403
Okay, have Kentucky. Who cares?

121
00:10:39.528 --> 00:10:40.987
- It's small, it's small.
- Donald Trump!


122
00:10:41.113 --> 00:10:42.572
- But he is winning.
- Donald Trump!


123
00:10:42.697 --> 00:10:45.241
Her lead beginning to go down
a little bit but still holding,


124
00:10:45.366 --> 00:10:46.743
so that's good news.

125
00:10:46.868 --> 00:10:49.120
Kansas, Nebraska, Wyoming.

126
00:10:49.245 --> 00:10:51.372
Trump, we project,
will win Texas.


127
00:10:51.497 --> 00:10:54.833
...Texas with all
of its 38 electoral votes.


128
00:10:58.337 --> 00:11:01.506
Anderson, this night is turning
out to be a real nail-biter.


129
00:11:01.631 --> 00:11:04.175
Donald Trump is leading
Hillary Clinton


130
00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:06.678
among white women in Ohio,

131
00:11:06.803 --> 00:11:09.097
North Carolina,
Georgia and Virginia.


132
00:11:09.222 --> 00:11:12.058
Does that surprise you?

133
00:11:12.183 --> 00:11:14.351
You should be nervous. This is
not kidding around anymore.


134
00:11:14.476 --> 00:11:16.937
Louisiana, Montana, Missouri,

135
00:11:17.062 --> 00:11:19.147
- Ohio...
- Are you me?


136
00:11:19.273 --> 00:11:20.816
Corning into the day,
you had your projection


137
00:11:20.941 --> 00:11:22.400
above 70% for Hillary Clinton.

138
00:11:22.525 --> 00:11:24.319
Where is it right now?

139
00:11:24.444 --> 00:11:25.570
But the crowd now
much more subdued here


140
00:11:25.695 --> 00:11:27.488
- this evening...
- Donald Trump


141
00:11:27.613 --> 00:11:29.407
will carry the state
of Florida.


142
00:11:32.243 --> 00:11:34.286
All right, we have another
major projection right now,


143
00:11:34.411 --> 00:11:36.997
that Donald Trump will carry
the state of North Carolina.


144
00:11:37.122 --> 00:11:38.415
Oh, wow.

145
00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:39.833
Can-can we go back to Michigan?

146
00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:41.001
'Cause I'm not sure
I saw it correctly.


147
00:11:41.126 --> 00:11:42.460
Was that a-a...

148
00:11:42.586 --> 00:11:43.670
Uh, Huffington Post,

149
00:11:43.795 --> 00:11:45.588
what happened
to your 98.4%?


150
00:11:45.713 --> 00:11:47.048
CNN now projects
that Donald Trump


151
00:11:47.173 --> 00:11:49.383
will carry
the state of Wisconsin.


152
00:11:49.509 --> 00:11:51.677
He's cracked
the so-called blue wall.


153
00:11:51.802 --> 00:11:53.429
You pathetic losers!

154
00:11:53.554 --> 00:11:55.264
Winning Pennsylvania!

155
00:11:55.389 --> 00:11:57.349
Pennsylvania!

156
00:11:57.474 --> 00:11:59.351
Some big news here, Megan.
Huge news, actually.


157
00:11:59.476 --> 00:12:01.186
The AP now projecting
that Donald Trump


158
00:12:01.311 --> 00:12:02.771
has won the state
of Pennsylvania.


159
00:12:02.896 --> 00:12:04.939
Uh, Pennsylvania was called
for Donald Trump.


160
00:12:05.064 --> 00:12:06.691
It's over. Okay.

161
00:12:06.816 --> 00:12:08.192
CNN projects,

162
00:12:08.317 --> 00:12:10.319
Donald Trump
wins the presidency.


163
00:12:12.863 --> 00:12:15.074
I was happy he won.

164
00:12:15.199 --> 00:12:17.034
My film, Hillary's America,

165
00:12:17.159 --> 00:12:19.828
an expose' of Hillary
and the Democratic Party,


166
00:12:19.953 --> 00:12:21.121
played a role.

167
00:12:21.246 --> 00:12:23.748
But Trump made it happen.

168
00:12:23.873 --> 00:12:25.583
And when he won,

169
00:12:25.708 --> 00:12:29.378
that fact did not sit well
with the left.


170
00:12:31.339 --> 00:12:33.007
You're awake, by the way.

171
00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:35.259
You're not having
a terrible, terrible dream.


172
00:12:35.342 --> 00:12:37.594
Also, you're not dead,
and you haven't gone to hell.


173
00:12:37.719 --> 00:12:40.013
This is your life now.
This is our election now.


174
00:12:40.138 --> 00:12:41.598
This is us.
This is our country.


175
00:12:41.723 --> 00:12:43.099
It's real.

176
00:12:43.224 --> 00:12:46.227
Everybody is crying
and so upset.


177
00:12:46.352 --> 00:12:48.646
Scared, depressed, despair.

178
00:12:48.771 --> 00:12:50.273
America is crying tonight.

179
00:12:50.398 --> 00:12:52.525
She deserves to be
the first female president,


180
00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:54.526
and that's what makes me
so sad.


181
00:12:54.652 --> 00:12:57.362
Sorry, I hate crying
on camera, but...


182
00:12:57.488 --> 00:12:58.822
Get your abortions now.

183
00:12:58.947 --> 00:13:00.657
This sucks!

184
00:13:00.782 --> 00:13:03.576
People I'm speaking to think
it's absolutely catastrophic.


185
00:13:03.702 --> 00:13:06.996
Boastful, bullying,
coarse, crude--


186
00:13:07.121 --> 00:13:09.248
that's the way they're
gonna see America, so...


187
00:13:09.373 --> 00:13:11.834
Ugly Americans,
right? -Ugly Americans.


188
00:13:11.959 --> 00:13:14.712
From slavery to,
you know, Nazism...


189
00:13:17.297 --> 00:13:20.342
We are not gonna be okay.

190
00:13:20.467 --> 00:13:21.635
Feels like the end
of the world.


191
00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:23.553
There are demonstrations
in major American cities


192
00:13:23.678 --> 00:13:25.638
across the country tonight over
the election of Donald Trump.


193
00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:29.392
Again,
the left turned to violence.


194
00:13:29.517 --> 00:13:31.560
Yeah

195
00:13:31.686 --> 00:13:33.479
Yeah!

196
00:13:33.604 --> 00:13:34.772
ls there a doomsday plan?

197
00:13:34.897 --> 00:13:36.440
We're gonna...

198
00:13:36.565 --> 00:13:39.568
We're gonna go after him
in every conceivable way.


199
00:13:39.693 --> 00:13:41.736
ATrump presidency
is unthinkable and dangerous


200
00:13:41.862 --> 00:13:44.989
and damaging, so, basically,
anything we do to stop that


201
00:13:45.115 --> 00:13:46.950
is perfectly fine.
Whether it's ethical or not,


202
00:13:47.075 --> 00:13:49.076
whether it's legal or not,
it doesn't matter.


203
00:13:50.244 --> 00:13:51.746
The political left

204
00:13:51.871 --> 00:13:54.582
immediately set out
to reverse the election results


205
00:13:54.707 --> 00:13:56.875
with a sequence of strategies.

206
00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.752
Today, Jill Stein
of the Green Party called


207
00:13:58.877 --> 00:14:02.130
for recounts in Wisconsin,
Michigan and Pennsylvania.


208
00:14:02.255 --> 00:14:05.425
That recount actually
increased Trump's lead.


209
00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:07.719
Thank you. Thank you, darling.

210
00:14:07.844 --> 00:14:09.345
There were
countless stories of Trump


211
00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:11.055
losing the popular vote.

212
00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:12.306
Donald Trump
won fair and square.


213
00:14:12.431 --> 00:14:13.766
How did he win fair and square?

214
00:14:13.891 --> 00:14:15.059
Hillary had more votes.

215
00:14:15.184 --> 00:14:16.769
And they tried this.

216
00:14:16.894 --> 00:14:18.770
Republican members
of the electoral college,


217
00:14:18.895 --> 00:14:20.564
this message is for you.

218
00:14:20.689 --> 00:14:21.857
Maybe they could convince

219
00:14:21.982 --> 00:14:23.692
Trump electors
not to vote for him.


220
00:14:23.817 --> 00:14:26.152
I'm going to talk to
an electoral college voter next


221
00:14:26.277 --> 00:14:29.614
who says it's gone
as far as death threats.


222
00:14:29.739 --> 00:14:32.616
The votes are ten votes,
Donald J. Trump.


223
00:14:32.742 --> 00:14:35.077
You sold out
our country!


224
00:14:35.202 --> 00:14:36.370
You sold out our country!

225
00:14:36.495 --> 00:14:38.080
Every one of you,
you're pathetic!


226
00:14:38.205 --> 00:14:40.499
- You don't deserve to be
in America! -Shame! Shame!


227
00:14:40.624 --> 00:14:42.959
Shame on you! Shame on you!

228
00:14:43.084 --> 00:14:44.794
Yes,
shame on the American people


229
00:14:44.919 --> 00:14:45.962
for voting for Trump.

230
00:14:46.087 --> 00:14:47.463
Shame on you.

231
00:14:47.588 --> 00:14:49.465
Tens of millions of Americans

232
00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:52.885
are totally fine with a man
who's driven almost purely


233
00:14:53.010 --> 00:14:55.721
by racism and sexism
and lslamophobia.


234
00:14:55.846 --> 00:14:57.139
I genuinely do not understand

235
00:14:57.264 --> 00:14:59.016
how America
can be this disorganized


236
00:14:59.141 --> 00:15:00.726
or this hateful.

237
00:15:00.851 --> 00:15:03.812
I have no respect for women
who voted for Trump. Okay?


238
00:15:03.937 --> 00:15:05.230
I just think you're dumb. Okay?

239
00:15:05.355 --> 00:15:07.148
I think you're dumb.

240
00:15:07.273 --> 00:15:08.941
How do you think
people are going to vote


241
00:15:09.066 --> 00:15:10.610
if you talk to them that way?

242
00:15:10.735 --> 00:15:13.988
The vice president
of the United States,


243
00:15:14.113 --> 00:15:15.948
Michael R. Pence.

244
00:15:16.073 --> 00:15:19.076
More than 50 House Democrats

245
00:15:19.201 --> 00:15:21.828
boycotted the inauguration
of President Trump.


246
00:15:21.953 --> 00:15:24.039
Although the left
did show up...


247
00:15:24.164 --> 00:15:25.707
- to riot.
- What Antifa is.


248
00:15:25.832 --> 00:15:27.750
This is what
the anti-Trump movement is.


249
00:15:31.837 --> 00:15:34.215
It is total anarchy
in the streets right now.


250
00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:35.799
...preserve,
protect and defend...


251
00:15:35.924 --> 00:15:37.468
...preserve,
protect and defend...


252
00:15:37.593 --> 00:15:40.220
...the Constitution
of the United States...


253
00:15:40.345 --> 00:15:42.639
...the Constitution
of the United States...


254
00:15:42.764 --> 00:15:44.933
-...so help me God.
-...so help me God.


255
00:15:45.058 --> 00:15:46.935
Congratulations, Mr. President.

256
00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:49.187
Yeah!

257
00:15:50.813 --> 00:15:55.484
No...!...!

258
00:15:55.609 --> 00:15:59.655
The left couldn't
keep him from being sworn in


259
00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:01.156
as president
of the United States,


260
00:16:01.281 --> 00:16:03.158
so they turned to impeachment.

261
00:16:03.283 --> 00:16:08.830
Next week, there will be
a vote to impeach.


262
00:16:08.955 --> 00:16:10.706
It's obviously a-a...
It's no small matter


263
00:16:10.831 --> 00:16:12.041
when we're talking
about impeaching


264
00:16:12.166 --> 00:16:13.250
the president
of the United States.


265
00:16:13.375 --> 00:16:15.669
You could write it down
in stone.


266
00:16:15.794 --> 00:16:18.255
He will not finish
his first term.


267
00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:22.259
The Democrats will take over,
and they can launch impeachment


268
00:16:22.384 --> 00:16:26.262
in 2019 without
a single Republican vote.


269
00:16:26.387 --> 00:16:28.848
Robert Mueller's Russia probe
will eventually reveal


270
00:16:28.973 --> 00:16:31.475
misdeeds
that are impeachment-worthy.


271
00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:35.729
Everyone is colluding
with Russia, except Trump.


272
00:16:35.854 --> 00:16:38.023
Here's Donald Trump. Donald.

273
00:16:38.148 --> 00:16:40.400
Maybe
the sexual harassment stuff


274
00:16:40.525 --> 00:16:42.819
would finally stick.

275
00:16:42.944 --> 00:16:44.904
But we knew
we weren't electing a choirboy.


276
00:16:45.029 --> 00:16:46.781
There's a new report alleging

277
00:16:46.906 --> 00:16:49.784
that Lisa Bloom solicited funds
to pay off women


278
00:16:49.909 --> 00:16:52.703
who would then accuse the
president of sexual assault.


279
00:16:52.828 --> 00:16:54.705
How about the 25th Amendment?

280
00:16:54.830 --> 00:16:56.790
Because, you know,
Trump is crazy.


281
00:16:56.915 --> 00:16:58.458
The amendment
says the president


282
00:16:58.584 --> 00:17:00.502
can be removed if majority
of the cabinet determines


283
00:17:00.627 --> 00:17:02.254
that he is unfit.

284
00:17:02.379 --> 00:17:04.506
This is a dangerously,
emotionally


285
00:17:04.631 --> 00:17:07.884
and-and mentally unstable
individual here.


286
00:17:10.094 --> 00:17:13.055
All this
may seem unprecedented,


287
00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:15.391
but we've been here before.

288
00:17:17.059 --> 00:17:22.063
In 1860, America elected
the first Republican president.


289
00:17:22.189 --> 00:17:25.066
Then, too, Democrats
viciously attacked him.


290
00:17:25.191 --> 00:17:28.861
They called him an extremist
and an authoritarian.


291
00:17:28.986 --> 00:17:31.322
Some sought
to break up the country


292
00:17:31.447 --> 00:17:33.657
rather than accept
his election.


293
00:17:33.782 --> 00:17:36.869
Lincoln saved America
for the first time.


294
00:17:36.994 --> 00:17:39.913
And now, by tragic necessity,

295
00:17:40.038 --> 00:17:42.666
Trump is in
a similar situation.


296
00:17:42.791 --> 00:17:46.002
What will the Democrats try
this time?


297
00:17:48.171 --> 00:17:50.006
Look at this Hitler speech.
And we've translated it


298
00:17:50.131 --> 00:17:51.007
for you.

299
00:17:51.132 --> 00:17:52.758
"Thank you. Thank you.

300
00:17:52.883 --> 00:17:54.843
We're going to make Germany
great again."


301
00:17:54.969 --> 00:17:58.430
90% of what he says,
I'm like, "This guy gets it."


302
00:17:58.555 --> 00:18:01.892
He's going to take our economy
from here to here.


303
00:18:02.017 --> 00:18:03.893
Yeah, he's definitely taking it
to a higher level.


304
00:18:04.019 --> 00:18:06.563
I'd say his support is about,
uh... about up there.


305
00:18:06.688 --> 00:18:09.023
Right around here.

306
00:18:09.148 --> 00:18:12.568
Donald Trump is flirting
with fascism, American-style.


307
00:18:12.693 --> 00:18:15.904
There's a word for this,
Ashley. It's "fascism."


308
00:18:16.030 --> 00:18:17.781
And they don't
just call him a fascist.


309
00:18:17.906 --> 00:18:20.367
Do you think
President Trump is a racist?


310
00:18:20.492 --> 00:18:22.202
I think he is a racist.

311
00:18:22.327 --> 00:18:25.997
This was a white-lash
against a changing country.


312
00:18:26.122 --> 00:18:27.999
The president
is "a white supremacist"


313
00:18:28.124 --> 00:18:30.585
and that his rise is "a direct
result of white supremacy."


314
00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:34.797
There it is,
racism and fascism.


315
00:18:34.922 --> 00:18:36.298
And we've heard it before.

316
00:18:36.423 --> 00:18:38.300
These incendiary accusations

317
00:18:38.425 --> 00:18:42.220
have been used for a generation
to shame and smear


318
00:18:42.345 --> 00:18:44.139
Republicans, conservatives,

319
00:18:44.264 --> 00:18:46.474
Christians and patriots.

320
00:18:46.599 --> 00:18:49.644
Is voting for Trump
like voting for Hitler?


321
00:18:49.769 --> 00:18:53.022
Did Trump win because
of fascism and white supremacy?


322
00:18:53.147 --> 00:18:58.151
Did he revive the worst strains
of America 's history of racism?


323
00:18:58.277 --> 00:19:00.362
Wouldn't that justify the left

324
00:19:00.487 --> 00:19:02.781
in rejecting the results
of the election?


325
00:19:04.741 --> 00:19:07.744
But if they're wrong,
if America is good,


326
00:19:07.869 --> 00:19:10.413
aren't we morally obligated
to defend her?


327
00:19:10.538 --> 00:19:12.665
The stakes could not be higher.

328
00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:16.752
We're talking about the fate of
the greatest nation on Earth.


329
00:19:16.877 --> 00:19:19.588
Who are the real fascists?

330
00:19:19.713 --> 00:19:22.716
Who are the real racists?

331
00:19:22.841 --> 00:19:25.468
We must learn the truth.

332
00:19:25.593 --> 00:19:27.720
For progressives today,

333
00:19:27.845 --> 00:19:29.514
fascism is on the right,

334
00:19:29.639 --> 00:19:33.184
a philosophy of nationalism
and authoritarianism.


335
00:19:33.309 --> 00:19:37.020
They call Trump a fascist
because he's a nationalist.


336
00:19:37.146 --> 00:19:39.189
But so was
my countryman, Gandhi.


337
00:19:39.314 --> 00:19:42.025
So was Mandela
and Winston Churchill.


338
00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:44.235
Lincoln was a nationalist.

339
00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:46.070
Were these men fascists?

340
00:19:46.196 --> 00:19:48.906
We've had authoritarian leaders
since the beginning of time,


341
00:19:49.031 --> 00:19:50.908
but few were fascists.

342
00:19:51.033 --> 00:19:54.036
Look, Trump gets flayed
in the media every day.


343
00:19:54.161 --> 00:19:57.623
Real authoritarians
would have shut that down.


344
00:19:57.748 --> 00:20:00.125
So authoritarianism
and nationalism


345
00:20:00.250 --> 00:20:02.961
don't exhaust the meaning
of fascism.


346
00:20:03.086 --> 00:20:05.880
To go deeper, I sat down
with progressive historian


347
00:20:06.005 --> 00:20:08.007
Robert Paxton,

348
00:20:08.132 --> 00:20:09.717
former head
of Columbia University's


349
00:20:09.842 --> 00:20:11.886
history department.

350
00:20:12.011 --> 00:20:15.764
Paxton is no fan
of Donald Trump.


351
00:20:15.889 --> 00:20:18.767
We have a group
in America today, Antifa...


352
00:20:20.977 --> 00:20:22.270
...which fashions itself

353
00:20:22.395 --> 00:20:23.521
anti-fascist.

354
00:20:23.647 --> 00:20:25.899
- Yes. -It drive speakers
off the campus.


355
00:20:26.024 --> 00:20:29.277
Outwardly, it seems like
there is some resemblance


356
00:20:29.402 --> 00:20:30.403
to Mussolini's Blackshirts.

357
00:20:30.528 --> 00:20:33.197
And the mission
appears the same.


358
00:20:33.322 --> 00:20:36.867
In other words, to enforce a
kind of ideological conformity


359
00:20:36.992 --> 00:20:39.411
by roughing up your opposition.

360
00:20:39.536 --> 00:20:41.997
Do you see a parallel
between Antifa


361
00:20:42.122 --> 00:20:44.833
and the fascists that they
claim to be fighting?


362
00:20:44.958 --> 00:20:47.377
I think there's
some tactical overlap.


363
00:20:47.502 --> 00:20:48.920
As soon as you start, uh,

364
00:20:49.045 --> 00:20:51.047
wearing a uniform
and beating people up,


365
00:20:51.172 --> 00:20:53.090
you're obviously
in fascist territory.


366
00:20:53.215 --> 00:20:55.301
Now, does fascism matter today?

367
00:20:55.426 --> 00:20:57.302
- Yes.
- Some people have said


368
00:20:57.427 --> 00:20:59.304
we are living through
a fascist moment,


369
00:20:59.429 --> 00:21:01.806
or a fascist strain,
in American politics.


370
00:21:01.932 --> 00:21:03.642
Are you worried
that that's true?


371
00:21:03.767 --> 00:21:07.061
The fascist label
seems to me to overlook


372
00:21:07.186 --> 00:21:08.813
two very important differences.

373
00:21:08.938 --> 00:21:10.565
One is that fascist regimes

374
00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:12.358
did not want a free economy.

375
00:21:12.483 --> 00:21:14.109
They had a regulated economy,

376
00:21:14.235 --> 00:21:16.820
and they had
what was called corporatism,


377
00:21:16.945 --> 00:21:20.032
uh, the... and all
the business enterprises


378
00:21:20.157 --> 00:21:23.785
were required to participate
in five-year plans,


379
00:21:23.910 --> 00:21:28.081
and that is the opposite
of what's going on.


380
00:21:28.206 --> 00:21:30.833
So the principles
of the American founding--


381
00:21:30.958 --> 00:21:33.043
the separation
of state and society,


382
00:21:33.169 --> 00:21:34.878
- Mm-hmm.
- limited government,


383
00:21:35.004 --> 00:21:36.672
- Yes.
- Individual rights,


384
00:21:36.797 --> 00:21:40.467
property rights, free markets--

385
00:21:40.592 --> 00:21:43.178
would you agree that this is
what the fascists hated?


386
00:21:43.303 --> 00:21:45.180
The fascists,
and a lot of other people,


387
00:21:45.305 --> 00:21:47.307
believed that these things
had failed,


388
00:21:47.432 --> 00:21:49.767
and they were... they, uh,
were determined to propose


389
00:21:49.892 --> 00:21:52.520
an alternative that
would revive their country.


390
00:21:52.645 --> 00:21:53.938
Dateline Rome.

391
00:21:54.063 --> 00:21:56.315
October 31, 1922.

392
00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:58.609
<i>Italy was</i> a <i>sitting duck
for an ex-Communist</i>


393
00:21:58.734 --> 00:22:00.360
named Benito Mussolini.

394
00:22:00.485 --> 00:22:02.112
The lantern-jawed
founder of fascism


395
00:22:02.237 --> 00:22:04.572
took advantage of
the political unrest in Italy


396
00:22:04.697 --> 00:22:05.990
after World War I.

397
00:22:06.115 --> 00:22:08.034
Mussolini directed
a march on Rome.


398
00:22:12.496 --> 00:22:14.790
The next step was
complete dictatorial control,


399
00:22:14.915 --> 00:22:16.792
a step which the Italian
Blackshirt leader


400
00:22:16.917 --> 00:22:18.961
took without a second thought.

401
00:22:19.086 --> 00:22:21.129
When Mussolini started out,

402
00:22:21.254 --> 00:22:22.380
he was a Marxist.

403
00:22:22.505 --> 00:22:24.174
- He was a socialist.
- Yes.


404
00:22:24.299 --> 00:22:25.842
He was the editor
of the socialist newspaper.


405
00:22:25.967 --> 00:22:27.510
- Yes.
- He had a long background


406
00:22:27.635 --> 00:22:28.636
in socialist politics, right?

407
00:22:28.761 --> 00:22:29.679
Right, right. Exactly.

408
00:22:29.804 --> 00:22:30.846
Mussolini allied himself

409
00:22:30.972 --> 00:22:32.306
with an intellectual,

410
00:22:32.431 --> 00:22:33.807
- Giovanni Gentile.
- Yes.


411
00:22:33.933 --> 00:22:35.726
Gentile famously said,

412
00:22:35.851 --> 00:22:38.395
"Everything in the state,
and nothing outside the state."


413
00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:40.856
- Yes. -Which Mussolini
himself later repeated.


414
00:22:40.981 --> 00:22:43.400
How would you interpret
this doctrine


415
00:22:43.525 --> 00:22:46.611
of sort of
centralized state power?


416
00:22:46.736 --> 00:22:50.198
Mussolini, uh, and the people
who rallied to his cause--


417
00:22:50.323 --> 00:22:52.616
and this included
some highly educated people


418
00:22:52.742 --> 00:22:54.076
like Giovanni Gentile--

419
00:22:54.201 --> 00:22:55.869
they were absolutely determined

420
00:22:55.994 --> 00:22:58.664
to make Italy strong,
and it would come about


421
00:22:58.789 --> 00:23:00.540
by a central authority

422
00:23:00.665 --> 00:23:03.335
and direction,
and I think that the state,


423
00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:06.379
uh, was the instrument
by which they thought


424
00:23:06.504 --> 00:23:09.048
that, uh, Italy
would be regenerated.


425
00:23:09.173 --> 00:23:11.300
And loyalty to the state
is the vehicle


426
00:23:11.425 --> 00:23:14.094
-to mobilize that inner soul,
right? -Yes.


427
00:23:21.852 --> 00:23:23.728
Mussolini was responding

428
00:23:23.853 --> 00:23:26.940
to what historians called
the Crisis of Marxism.


429
00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:31.193
Marx predicted
that worker revolts would erupt


430
00:23:31.319 --> 00:23:34.321
in every
industrialized country.


431
00:23:34.446 --> 00:23:37.032
But this never took place.

432
00:23:37.157 --> 00:23:39.534
Marx thought workers
around the world


433
00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:41.661
would identify with each other

434
00:23:41.786 --> 00:23:43.747
on the basis of class.

435
00:23:43.872 --> 00:23:45.832
He rejected nationalism,

436
00:23:45.957 --> 00:23:48.584
saying a working man
has no country.


437
00:23:50.253 --> 00:23:53.339
But Gentile,
though himself a socialist,


438
00:23:53.464 --> 00:23:55.758
noticed that during World War I

439
00:23:55.883 --> 00:23:58.552
working men fought
for their own country.


440
00:23:58.677 --> 00:24:00.887
Mussolini and Gentile concluded

441
00:24:01.012 --> 00:24:04.015
that a new type
of socialism was needed


442
00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:08.394
that would fuse nationalism
and socialism.


443
00:24:08.519 --> 00:24:10.896
They called it "fascism."

444
00:24:11.022 --> 00:24:15.234
<i>And this is why socialists
and progressives in America,</i>


445
00:24:15.359 --> 00:24:17.945
many of whom had given up
on orthodox Marxism,


446
00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:19.696
were drawn to fascism.

447
00:24:19.821 --> 00:24:21.072
In the working out

448
00:24:21.198 --> 00:24:23.908
of a great national program

449
00:24:24.034 --> 00:24:26.494
that seeks the primary good
of the greater number...


450
00:24:26.619 --> 00:24:28.496
Our new president at the time,

451
00:24:28.621 --> 00:24:31.374
Franklin Delano Roosevelt,
was infatuated


452
00:24:31.499 --> 00:24:33.667
by Mussolini.

453
00:24:33.792 --> 00:24:38.130
He called him "that admirable
Italian gentleman."


454
00:24:38.255 --> 00:24:41.424
"I am much interested
and deeply impressed


455
00:24:41.550 --> 00:24:44.386
"by what he has accomplished
and by his evidenced


456
00:24:44.511 --> 00:24:48.264
honest purpose
in restoring Italy."


457
00:24:48.389 --> 00:24:51.600
Mussolini reviewed FDR's book
in an Italian magazine.


458
00:24:51.726 --> 00:24:55.020
"FDR is one of us.

459
00:24:55.145 --> 00:24:57.189
He's a fascist."

460
00:24:57.314 --> 00:25:00.776
FDR dispatched members
of his brain trust to Rome


461
00:25:00.901 --> 00:25:02.193
to study Italian fascism

462
00:25:02.319 --> 00:25:05.613
with a view to importing
some of it here.


463
00:25:05.738 --> 00:25:08.449
Rexford Tugwell,
one of FDR's closest advisors,


464
00:25:08.574 --> 00:25:11.661
after returning from Italy,
observed:


465
00:25:11.786 --> 00:25:13.913
<i>"Fascism is the cleanest,
neatest,</i>


466
00:25:14.038 --> 00:25:16.874
<i>"most efficient piece
of social machinery</i>


467
00:25:16.999 --> 00:25:19.376
"I've ever seen.

468
00:25:19.501 --> 00:25:21.044
It makes me envious."

469
00:25:21.169 --> 00:25:24.839
The head of FDR's NRA,
or National Recovery Act,


470
00:25:24.964 --> 00:25:27.258
Hugh Johnson, spoke of

471
00:25:27.383 --> 00:25:30.886
the "shining example
of Mussolini, "


472
00:25:31.012 --> 00:25:34.098
he carried fascist literature
in his pocket, and he called


473
00:25:34.223 --> 00:25:37.351
for the end of free-market
capitalism in America.


474
00:25:37.476 --> 00:25:40.729
He empowered industrial
committees in every industry


475
00:25:40.854 --> 00:25:43.023
to set wages and prices

476
00:25:43.148 --> 00:25:44.899
and report
to the federal government.


477
00:25:45.024 --> 00:25:49.820
Clearly, FDR recognized
fascism was on the left.


478
00:25:49.946 --> 00:25:53.324
He saw it as more progressive
than the New Deal.


479
00:25:53.449 --> 00:25:55.951
Mussolini was clearly
a man of the left.


480
00:25:56.076 --> 00:25:59.162
But what about the ultimate
fascist of them all,


481
00:25:59.288 --> 00:26:00.497
Adolf Hitler?

482
00:26:00.622 --> 00:26:02.916
Was he a man of the left?

483
00:26:03.041 --> 00:26:06.002
To figure this out,
we must go to Europe.


484
00:26:21.433 --> 00:26:23.685
Hitler, like Mussolini,
was a veteran


485
00:26:23.810 --> 00:26:25.728
of World War I.

486
00:26:27.105 --> 00:26:28.773
His politics were formed

487
00:26:28.898 --> 00:26:31.400
here in Schwabing,
in the atmosphere


488
00:26:31.525 --> 00:26:34.153
of bohemianism
and sectarian socialism.


489
00:26:36.613 --> 00:26:39.783
The Communist Lenin
lived here in exile.


490
00:26:39.908 --> 00:26:42.577
Hitler and Lenin
both frequented the same pub.


491
00:26:42.702 --> 00:26:45.872
Lenin famously
didn't pay his bar tab.


492
00:26:45.997 --> 00:26:48.958
Imagine Lenin sitting here
arguing with friends


493
00:26:49.083 --> 00:26:51.585
on how to save Communism.

494
00:26:51.711 --> 00:26:54.672
Lenin lived
just a block up the street.


495
00:26:54.797 --> 00:26:57.424
Hitler lived a block over.

496
00:26:57.549 --> 00:27:00.844
Hitler changed the name
of the German Workers' Party


497
00:27:00.969 --> 00:27:04.722
to the National Socialist
German Workers' Party.


498
00:27:04.848 --> 00:27:08.559
The very term "Nazi"
is a compression of two words:


499
00:27:08.684 --> 00:27:12.271
"national " and "sozialista. "

500
00:27:12.396 --> 00:27:15.816
Check out the official
Nazi platform:


501
00:27:15.941 --> 00:27:18.485
State-controlled health care.

502
00:27:18.610 --> 00:27:21.863
Profit sharing for workers
in large corporations.


503
00:27:21.988 --> 00:27:25.366
Money lenders and profiteers
punished by death.


504
00:27:25.492 --> 00:27:27.535
State control of education.

505
00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:30.121
State control
of media and the press.


506
00:27:30.246 --> 00:27:32.623
State control of banks
and industries.


507
00:27:32.748 --> 00:27:35.125
Seizure of land
without compensation.


508
00:27:35.250 --> 00:27:37.503
State control
of religious expression.


509
00:27:37.628 --> 00:27:39.921
This reads like something
jointly written


510
00:27:40.047 --> 00:27:42.507
by Elizabeth Warren
and Bernie Sanders.


511
00:27:42.632 --> 00:27:43.967
Read the Nazi platform

512
00:27:44.092 --> 00:27:46.052
at the Democratic
National Convention,


513
00:27:46.177 --> 00:27:49.305
and most likely it would
provoke thunderous applause.


514
00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:53.184
Like Mussolini and Lenin,
Hitler was anti-big business,


515
00:27:53.309 --> 00:27:56.186
anti-bourgeois
and anti-capitalist.


516
00:27:56.311 --> 00:28:00.774
But unlike Mussolini and Lenin,
Hitler was also a racist.


517
00:28:00.899 --> 00:28:04.069
His racism, too,
was rooted in his hatred


518
00:28:04.194 --> 00:28:06.446
of capitalism and business.

519
00:28:06.571 --> 00:28:08.948
He called the Jews
"greedy bankers."


520
00:28:09.073 --> 00:28:11.951
Hitler set out
to destroy the Jews,


521
00:28:12.076 --> 00:28:15.120
confiscate their wealth
and redistribute it


522
00:28:15.245 --> 00:28:19.708
through Nazi socialist
and welfare state programs.


523
00:28:23.503 --> 00:28:27.465
Another group Hitler hated
were the Communists.


524
00:28:30.218 --> 00:28:32.094
Not because
they were socialists,


525
00:28:32.219 --> 00:28:35.681
but because they took
their orders from Moscow.


526
00:28:35.806 --> 00:28:40.143
His thuggery started right here
at Schellingstrasse 50,


527
00:28:40.268 --> 00:28:42.729
Hitler's Nazi headquarters.

528
00:29:01.037 --> 00:29:04.916
Hitler saw the Communists
as traitors to Germany.


529
00:29:18.262 --> 00:29:20.514
He was a National Socialist,

530
00:29:20.639 --> 00:29:23.183
and they were
International Socialists.


531
00:29:27.145 --> 00:29:29.188
He patterned his Brownshirts

532
00:29:29.313 --> 00:29:32.191
both on Mussolini's Blackshirts
and on the Ku Klux Klan.


533
00:29:38.363 --> 00:29:40.365
The Nazi Brownshirts
and the Klan


534
00:29:40.490 --> 00:29:44.327
were both about the same size--
two to three million members.


535
00:29:44.452 --> 00:29:47.914
Both groups targeted
a vulnerable minority."


536
00:29:48.039 --> 00:29:50.208
in the case
of the Brownshirts, Jews;


537
00:29:50.333 --> 00:29:53.294
in the case of the KKK, blacks.

538
00:30:00.175 --> 00:30:03.803
And both groups were extensions
of a political party:


539
00:30:03.928 --> 00:30:07.724
in the case of the Brownshirts,
the Nazi Party;


540
00:30:07.849 --> 00:30:11.727
in the case of the Klan,
the Democratic Party.


541
00:30:19.151 --> 00:30:22.821
In November of 1923,
Hitler and his Brownshirts


542
00:30:22.946 --> 00:30:25.031
took over
the Burger Brau Keller,


543
00:30:25.156 --> 00:30:28.242
a popular Munich beer hall.

544
00:32:02.704 --> 00:32:04.414
The following day, Hitler

545
00:32:04.539 --> 00:32:06.791
and 2,000 party members
marched on Munich


546
00:32:06.916 --> 00:32:08.209
to seize control.

547
00:32:08.334 --> 00:32:10.044
They were met by police.

548
00:32:10.169 --> 00:32:13.839
Hitler was arrested
and sent to Landsberg Prison,


549
00:32:13.964 --> 00:32:17.134
a formative period in his life.

550
00:32:18.468 --> 00:32:21.012
Here, Hitler dictated
Mein Kampf


551
00:32:21.138 --> 00:32:23.890
to his fellow prisoner,
Rudolf Hess.


552
00:32:47.412 --> 00:32:49.205
See how remote all of this is

553
00:32:49.330 --> 00:32:50.915
from the principles
of Abraham Lincoln


554
00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:53.167
and the American founding?

555
00:32:53.292 --> 00:32:55.878
Hitler, however,
had a much greater affinity


556
00:32:56.003 --> 00:32:59.339
for progressives and Democrats.

557
00:33:14.895 --> 00:33:16.438
It was here

558
00:33:16.563 --> 00:33:19.649
Hitler got a big idea
from the Democratic Party,


559
00:33:19.775 --> 00:33:22.569
one that would shape
his murderous campaigns.


560
00:33:24.070 --> 00:33:26.489
According to Pulitzer
Prize-winning biographer


561
00:33:26.614 --> 00:33:30.493
John Toland, Hitler often
praised the extermination


562
00:33:30.618 --> 00:33:34.830
of the "red savages" who could
not be tamed by captivity.


563
00:33:34.955 --> 00:33:38.667
Hitler admired
how Jacksonian Democrats


564
00:33:38.792 --> 00:33:41.253
"gunned down
the millions of redskins


565
00:33:41.378 --> 00:33:43.546
"to a few hundred thousand,

566
00:33:43.672 --> 00:33:46.924
"and now keep the modest
remnant under observation


567
00:33:47.050 --> 00:33:49.010
in a cage."

568
00:33:50.678 --> 00:33:53.722
His idea was to do
to the Poles, the Slavs,


569
00:33:53.848 --> 00:33:56.100
the Eastern Europeans
and the Russians


570
00:33:56.225 --> 00:34:01.771
precisely what the Jacksonian
Democrats did to the Indians.


571
00:34:07.110 --> 00:34:09.737
Hitler came to power in 1933.

572
00:34:11.322 --> 00:34:13.199
Heil Hitler!

573
00:34:13.324 --> 00:34:15.326
On the other side
of the Atlantic,


574
00:34:15.451 --> 00:34:17.828
another charismatic leader,

575
00:34:17.953 --> 00:34:20.288
FDR, was elected.

576
00:34:20.414 --> 00:34:23.208
The two men
recognized each other


577
00:34:23.333 --> 00:34:26.169
as fellow progressives.

578
00:34:26.294 --> 00:34:29.505
Here's what the Nazi newspaper,
Volkischer Beobachter,


579
00:34:29.630 --> 00:34:32.800
said of the FDR administration."

580
00:34:32.925 --> 00:34:35.427
"We, too,
as German National Socialists,


581
00:34:35.552 --> 00:34:38.972
are looking toward America."

582
00:34:39.097 --> 00:34:41.683
The Nazi paper
congratulated FDR


583
00:34:41.808 --> 00:34:46.229
for replacing the uninhibited
frenzy of market speculation


584
00:34:46.354 --> 00:34:48.856
with the adoption
of National Socialist


585
00:34:48.981 --> 00:34:50.983
strains of thought.

586
00:34:51.108 --> 00:34:54.320
Of FDR's New Deal,
the Volkischer Beobachter said:


587
00:34:54.445 --> 00:34:58.699
"We fear only the possibility
that it might fail. "


588
00:35:02.285 --> 00:35:06.205
Hitler quickly consolidated
his power.


589
00:35:06.331 --> 00:35:09.125
He executed leaders
of the Brownshirts


590
00:35:09.250 --> 00:35:11.127
who had challenged
his authority.


591
00:35:11.252 --> 00:35:13.879
This was the famous
Night of the Long Knives.


592
00:35:18.050 --> 00:35:20.343
Some progressives
try to portray Hitler


593
00:35:20.469 --> 00:35:23.763
as a right-winger
by insisting he was anti-gay.


594
00:35:27.517 --> 00:35:30.686
But Hitler knew that the
Brownshirt leader, Ernst Rohm,


595
00:35:30.811 --> 00:35:35.357
was a notorious homosexual,
as were many other Brownshirts.


596
00:35:37.067 --> 00:35:40.320
When Hitler showed up
to arrest Rohm...


597
00:35:40.445 --> 00:35:43.031
he encountered
a remarkable scene.


598
00:35:44.449 --> 00:35:46.784
Heil, mein Fuhrer!

599
00:35:53.874 --> 00:35:56.668
Rohm publicly suggested
that he, not Hitler,


600
00:35:56.794 --> 00:35:59.463
was the true leader
of the Nazi Party.


601
00:36:09.514 --> 00:36:11.932
When Heinrich Himmler
urged Hitler


602
00:36:12.058 --> 00:36:16.728
to purge the gay Brownshirts
out of the Nazi movement,


603
00:36:16.854 --> 00:36:18.563
Hitler refused.

604
00:36:18.689 --> 00:36:22.984
Hitler said he didn't care what
the Brownshirts did in private,


605
00:36:23.109 --> 00:36:25.111
as long as they were
good fighters.


606
00:36:28.197 --> 00:36:31.867
Hitler was no
social conservative.


607
00:36:31.992 --> 00:36:34.828
Earlier, we saw what Hitler
learned from the Democrats.


608
00:36:34.954 --> 00:36:36.121
But was there anything

609
00:36:36.246 --> 00:36:38.749
he learned from
American progressives?


610
00:36:38.874 --> 00:36:42.043
Investigative journalist
Edwin Black,


611
00:36:42.168 --> 00:36:45.463
the son of Holocaust survivors,
is the author


612
00:36:45.588 --> 00:36:47.924
of The War Against the Weak.

613
00:36:48.049 --> 00:36:50.551
Now, you have written
that eugenics in America--


614
00:36:50.676 --> 00:36:53.679
and this is true in other parts
of Europe as well--


615
00:36:53.804 --> 00:36:56.932
was a progressive CEIUSG.

616
00:36:57.057 --> 00:36:59.393
Progressive in what sense?

617
00:36:59.518 --> 00:37:01.228
Progressive in every sense.

618
00:37:01.353 --> 00:37:02.771
This was not done by people

619
00:37:02.896 --> 00:37:04.731
who thought that
they were race haters.


620
00:37:04.856 --> 00:37:06.649
This was done
by the do-gooders,


621
00:37:06.774 --> 00:37:10.361
the liberals, the people
who wanted to improve society.


622
00:37:10.486 --> 00:37:15.449
Margaret Sanger, a progressive
who wanted to help humanity.


623
00:37:15.574 --> 00:37:17.618
And her approach to doing that

624
00:37:17.743 --> 00:37:20.912
was to wipe away the existence
of two-thirds of all people.


625
00:37:21.037 --> 00:37:23.623
You mean two-thirds of
the entire American population?


626
00:37:23.748 --> 00:37:25.542
- Yes, of course.
- And she actually


627
00:37:25.667 --> 00:37:27.460
- explicitly said this?
- Of course.


628
00:37:27.585 --> 00:37:29.795
She wanted to get rid
of "human weeds."


629
00:37:29.921 --> 00:37:32.089
She wrote about this
extensively.


630
00:37:32.214 --> 00:37:34.049
<i>At one point,
Hitler wrote fan mail</i>


631
00:37:34.174 --> 00:37:36.427
to one of her colleagues
on her board


632
00:37:36.552 --> 00:37:39.429
and said, uh,
"Your writings are my bible."


633
00:37:39.554 --> 00:37:40.847
Uh, this is Madison Grant,

634
00:37:40.972 --> 00:37:43.475
the head of the New York
Zoological Society.


635
00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:46.311
Tell me about the meeting
between Madison Grant


636
00:37:46.436 --> 00:37:48.896
and Whitney,
another prominent eugenicist.


637
00:37:49.021 --> 00:37:53.609
Madison Grant is discussing
his fan mail from Adolf Hitler,


638
00:37:53.734 --> 00:37:57.112
and Whitney has an identical
letter just like it.


639
00:37:57.237 --> 00:38:01.533
And so they both have letters
in which Hitler thanks them.


640
00:38:01.658 --> 00:38:03.535
All these eugenicists saying,

641
00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:08.456
"We have had a dramatic impact
on Germany."


642
00:38:08.581 --> 00:38:10.750
And you quote an American
progressive eugenicist


643
00:38:10.875 --> 00:38:13.460
basically saying, "Hey, whoa,
we've got to pick it up.


644
00:38:13.586 --> 00:38:15.087
"The Nazis are beating us

645
00:38:15.212 --> 00:38:17.339
- at our own game."
- That's right.


646
00:38:17.464 --> 00:38:19.424
While we were
pussyfooting around,


647
00:38:19.549 --> 00:38:22.677
the Nazis were beating us
at our own game.


648
00:38:22.802 --> 00:38:24.137
Why is it the case today,

649
00:38:24.262 --> 00:38:27.015
if I open
a Planned Parenthood brochure,


650
00:38:27.140 --> 00:38:30.810
I get a completely different
picture of Margaret Sanger


651
00:38:30.935 --> 00:38:32.686
than anything
that you've described?


652
00:38:32.812 --> 00:38:34.855
What's going on
is the reshaping


653
00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:36.774
and the falsifying of history.

654
00:38:36.899 --> 00:38:39.276
The Nazis
also invented history.


655
00:38:39.401 --> 00:38:41.069
There's a role
for people like me


656
00:38:41.194 --> 00:38:42.862
and a role for people like you.

657
00:38:42.988 --> 00:38:47.200
We spend our lives trying to
authenticate the real history.


658
00:38:48.534 --> 00:38:49.785
We've learned how Hitler

659
00:38:49.911 --> 00:38:52.038
got his murderous
conquest scheme


660
00:38:52.163 --> 00:38:53.747
from the Jacksonian Democrats.

661
00:38:53.873 --> 00:38:56.917
We've also learned
how he got eugenics schemes


662
00:38:57.042 --> 00:38:58.585
from left-wing progressives.

663
00:39:00.253 --> 00:39:04.883
But what does Nazi racism owe
to the Democratic Party?


664
00:39:05.008 --> 00:39:08.803
I went to see the historian
and sociologist Stefan Kuhl,


665
00:39:08.928 --> 00:39:11.305
who has developed
an international reputation


666
00:39:11.430 --> 00:39:14.183
for books like
The Nazi Connection.


667
00:39:14.308 --> 00:39:16.477
I met with him in Munich.

668
00:39:17.978 --> 00:39:20.230
What was the essence
of the Nuremberg Laws?


669
00:39:20.355 --> 00:39:21.523
These are the laws of 1935.

670
00:39:21.648 --> 00:39:24.943
What did they seek to do?

671
00:39:25.068 --> 00:39:27.820
They actually gave,
uh, the first definition


672
00:39:27.945 --> 00:39:29.864
of what is a Jew.

673
00:39:29.989 --> 00:39:31.907
It was not very easy
for the Nazis


674
00:39:32.032 --> 00:39:33.534
to define what is a Jew.

675
00:40:10.151 --> 00:40:12.570
Amerika?

676
00:41:34.812 --> 00:41:37.397
The Nazi Nuremberg Laws

677
00:41:37.523 --> 00:41:40.400
were directly modeled
on the segregation laws


678
00:41:40.525 --> 00:41:42.944
of the Democratic Party.

679
00:41:43.069 --> 00:41:45.905
Every segregation law
in the American South


680
00:41:46.030 --> 00:41:48.908
was passed
by a Democratic legislature,


681
00:41:49.033 --> 00:41:50.952
signed by
a Democratic governor


682
00:41:51.077 --> 00:41:54.538
and enforced
by Democratic officials.


683
00:41:54.663 --> 00:41:57.082
As for the Democratic
one-drop rule,


684
00:41:57.207 --> 00:42:01.586
incredibly, the Nazis found it
too racist even for them.


685
00:42:04.339 --> 00:42:05.882
As is well known,

686
00:42:06.007 --> 00:42:09.051
the Nazis also hated
freedom of speech.


687
00:42:09.177 --> 00:42:12.179
The Nazi concept was called
Gleichschaltung,


688
00:42:12.304 --> 00:42:16.391
which means bringing all the
cultural institutions in line


689
00:42:16.517 --> 00:42:18.185
with Nazi ideology.

690
00:42:18.310 --> 00:42:20.187
This was the significance

691
00:42:20.312 --> 00:42:22.647
of the "Heil Hitler" salute

692
00:42:22.772 --> 00:42:26.818
and the draping of
swastika flags off balconies.


693
00:42:26.943 --> 00:42:29.779
These things signaled
humble conformity


694
00:42:29.904 --> 00:42:32.573
to Nazi doctrine.

695
00:42:39.663 --> 00:42:42.165
And what happened
to dissident views


696
00:42:42.290 --> 00:42:44.334
on the German campus?

697
00:43:17.156 --> 00:43:19.282
- Heil Hitler!
- Heil Hitler!


698
00:43:20.659 --> 00:43:22.619
Movements to crush dissent

699
00:43:22.744 --> 00:43:26.247
can quickly escalate
from episodic violence


700
00:43:26.372 --> 00:43:28.082
to mass murder.

701
00:43:28.207 --> 00:43:30.418
Hitler's
Night of the Broken Glass


702
00:43:30.543 --> 00:43:34.463
was justified as a lawful
confiscation of firearms.


703
00:43:36.090 --> 00:43:39.092
This made Jews defenseless
against Nazi assault.


704
00:43:39.217 --> 00:43:44.013
Then Hitler could carry out his
goal to burn Jewish businesses,


705
00:43:44.139 --> 00:43:45.807
destroy synagogues

706
00:43:45.932 --> 00:43:48.601
and eliminate Jews
as a competitive threat


707
00:43:48.726 --> 00:43:50.686
in the German economy.

708
00:43:52.104 --> 00:43:54.398
Hitler didn't
just target synagogues.


709
00:43:54.523 --> 00:43:56.608
He also targeted
Christian churches.


710
00:43:56.733 --> 00:43:58.610
Many people don't know this,

711
00:43:58.735 --> 00:44:00.987
because they've bought
the progressive line


712
00:44:01.112 --> 00:44:03.365
that Hitler was a Christian.

713
00:44:03.490 --> 00:44:05.575
When coming to power,
Hitler knew he needed


714
00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:07.160
Christian support,

715
00:44:07.285 --> 00:44:10.413
and so he feigned
public belief in Christianity.


716
00:44:10.538 --> 00:44:13.332
But privately,
in a series of recordings,


717
00:44:13.457 --> 00:44:15.876
Hitler railed
against Christianity


718
00:44:16.001 --> 00:44:20.047
as a destructive institution
contrary to science


719
00:44:20.172 --> 00:44:24.092
and the natural law
of survival of the fittest.


720
00:44:26.010 --> 00:44:28.888
Once in office,
Hitler persecuted Christians.


721
00:44:29.013 --> 00:44:31.098
the total destruction

722
00:44:31.223 --> 00:44:33.851
of Christianity in Germany.

723
00:44:36.562 --> 00:44:39.898
As a progressive, Hitler
despised religious liberty.


724
00:44:40.023 --> 00:44:42.442
Nazism was his religion.

725
00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:49.866
With Germany the high altar

726
00:44:49.991 --> 00:44:53.244
and Hitler himself
the new messiah.


727
00:44:54.328 --> 00:44:56.830
Hitler was no Christian.

728
00:44:59.041 --> 00:45:02.711
American progressives cheered
Hitler's rise to power.


729
00:45:05.838 --> 00:45:07.632
They saw fascism,

730
00:45:07.757 --> 00:45:10.509
with its social control
and its glorification


731
00:45:10.635 --> 00:45:12.219
of the centralized state,

732
00:45:12.344 --> 00:45:15.055
as a model for the future.

733
00:45:22.604 --> 00:45:25.523
With total control
of the people in place,


734
00:45:25.648 --> 00:45:28.317
Hitler could now implement
his master plan.


735
00:45:36.075 --> 00:45:39.244
In 1939, he invaded Poland.

736
00:45:39.369 --> 00:45:41.955
Within two years,
he and Mussolini controlled


737
00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:43.373
continental Europe.

738
00:45:43.498 --> 00:45:45.166
Japan was at war with China.

739
00:45:45.291 --> 00:45:48.795
Fascism was on the march
across the world.


740
00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:52.506
Soon Hitler would declare war
against America.


741
00:45:56.844 --> 00:45:58.971
Once Hitler acquired
war captives,


742
00:45:59.096 --> 00:46:03.808
he saw a way to implement
his own slave plantation,


743
00:46:03.933 --> 00:46:06.436
which he called
the "concentration camp."


744
00:46:08.104 --> 00:46:11.023
Concentration camps,
which were forced-labor camps,


745
00:46:11.148 --> 00:46:15.069
should be distinguished from
death camps, whose sole purpose


746
00:46:15.194 --> 00:46:17.362
was extermination.

747
00:46:18.864 --> 00:46:22.117
What was the origin
of these death camps?


748
00:46:22.242 --> 00:46:24.994
His Minister
of Interior directed a program


749
00:46:25.119 --> 00:46:29.165
aimed at aged, insane
or incurable Germans,


750
00:46:29.290 --> 00:46:32.209
the so-called "useless eaters."

751
00:46:32.334 --> 00:46:35.004
Thousands were committed
to special institutions.


752
00:46:35.129 --> 00:46:37.965
Few ever returned.

753
00:46:38.090 --> 00:46:39.966
Evidence proves
they were murdered


754
00:46:40.092 --> 00:46:41.551
because they were useless
to the plans


755
00:46:41.676 --> 00:46:43.511
of the Nazi conspirators.

756
00:46:45.013 --> 00:46:48.057
Let's turn
to the Nazi euthanasia laws.


757
00:46:48.182 --> 00:46:50.268
First of all, would it
be accurate to say that


758
00:46:50.393 --> 00:46:51.769
we aren't talking
about real euthanasia?


759
00:46:51.894 --> 00:46:53.938
Without consent,
neither of the parents


760
00:46:54.063 --> 00:46:56.023
nor of the handicapped
himself, yeah.


761
00:46:56.148 --> 00:46:58.275
So euthanasia was
a pure euphemism, just...


762
00:46:58.400 --> 00:47:01.319
Yes. It was killing.
It was killing program.


763
00:47:01.444 --> 00:47:05.240
They started the killing
of mentally handicapped before


764
00:47:05.365 --> 00:47:07.116
on a very low-scale level,

765
00:47:07.241 --> 00:47:09.118
but, uh, started systematically

766
00:47:09.243 --> 00:47:11.120
with the killing
of mentally handicapped


767
00:47:11.245 --> 00:47:13.330
after the beginning
of the Second World War.


768
00:47:13.455 --> 00:47:16.375
And isn't it... isn't it true
to say that the...


769
00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:18.085
some of the personnel

770
00:47:18.210 --> 00:47:20.921
who administered
the euthanasia camps


771
00:47:21.046 --> 00:47:24.090
were also then later deployed

772
00:47:24.215 --> 00:47:25.884
to the so-called death camps

773
00:47:26.009 --> 00:47:29.095
that were used on a much larger
industrial scale?


774
00:47:29.220 --> 00:47:30.888
That's very clear.
We have technolog...


775
00:47:31.013 --> 00:47:32.932
technology transfer
and the personal transfer


776
00:47:33.057 --> 00:47:34.933
from the killing
of mentally handicapped


777
00:47:35.059 --> 00:47:36.351
to the killing of Jews.

778
00:47:36.477 --> 00:47:39.813
And especially
the whole staff operating


779
00:47:39.938 --> 00:47:41.648
the gas chambers, for example.

780
00:47:41.773 --> 00:47:44.400
Let me ask you
about Josef Mengele,


781
00:47:44.526 --> 00:47:47.695
the notorious Nazi doctor
at Auschwitz.


782
00:47:52.032 --> 00:47:55.452
When you read about him,
he saw himself as...


783
00:47:55.577 --> 00:47:57.037
as a progressive--

784
00:47:57.162 --> 00:47:59.873
somebody advancing
not only the cause of science,


785
00:47:59.998 --> 00:48:02.917
but the future benefit
to humanity.


786
00:48:03.043 --> 00:48:04.669
Progressive idea was

787
00:48:04.794 --> 00:48:07.463
very strongly part
of the Nazi ideology.


788
00:48:07.588 --> 00:48:10.091
<i>Would it surprise you
if I were to tell you</i>


789
00:48:10.216 --> 00:48:13.677
that after the war Mengele
went down to South America,


790
00:48:13.802 --> 00:48:16.513
where he actually had
a sort of career


791
00:48:16.638 --> 00:48:18.724
<i>as an abortionist?</i>

792
00:48:18.849 --> 00:48:20.016
No...!, not at all.

793
00:48:21.393 --> 00:48:23.520
In classic progressive fashion,

794
00:48:23.645 --> 00:48:26.230
Mengele made an easy transition

795
00:48:26.356 --> 00:48:29.942
from one form of killing
to another.


796
00:48:36.782 --> 00:48:38.825
Once American and Allied troops

797
00:48:38.950 --> 00:48:41.912
liberated
the concentration camps...


798
00:48:45.081 --> 00:48:49.210
...once the world saw
these ghostly, emaciated,


799
00:48:49.335 --> 00:48:52.797
starving figures emerge
from those camps,


800
00:48:52.922 --> 00:48:57.217
Nazism, fascism and theories
of racial superiority


801
00:48:57.342 --> 00:49:00.679
were permanently discredited.

802
00:49:09.228 --> 00:49:11.188
Immediately following the war,

803
00:49:11.313 --> 00:49:15.067
in the Nuremberg trials
held here in room 600,


804
00:49:15.192 --> 00:49:18.278
the full horror
of fascist and Nazi atrocities


805
00:49:18.403 --> 00:49:20.322
was put before the world.

806
00:49:20.447 --> 00:49:21.990
<i>United States of America</i>

807
00:49:22.115 --> 00:49:23.992
present count one
of the indictment,


808
00:49:24.117 --> 00:49:25.994
that all the defendants
participated


809
00:49:26.119 --> 00:49:29.997
as organizers or accomplices
in a common plan


810
00:49:30.122 --> 00:49:33.500
or conspiracy
to commit crimes against peace,


811
00:49:33.626 --> 00:49:36.962
war crimes
and crimes against humanity.


812
00:49:37.087 --> 00:49:40.340
Fascism became the
quintessential reference point


813
00:49:40.465 --> 00:49:41.883
for human evil.

814
00:49:50.016 --> 00:49:51.892
...opposition
by political parties


815
00:49:52.017 --> 00:49:54.561
which might defeat or obstruct

816
00:49:54.687 --> 00:49:56.772
the policy of the Nazi Party.

817
00:50:05.446 --> 00:50:08.491
Hermann Wilhelm Goring,
on the counts of the indictment


818
00:50:08.616 --> 00:50:10.076
which you
have been convicted,


819
00:50:10.201 --> 00:50:13.162
the Tribunal sentences you
to death by hanging.


820
00:50:15.539 --> 00:50:18.083
American progressives
were in a panic.


821
00:50:19.793 --> 00:50:23.088
They realized that if future
generations of Americans


822
00:50:23.213 --> 00:50:26.424
knew the intimate connection
between progressivism


823
00:50:26.549 --> 00:50:29.260
and the Democratic Party
on the one hand,


824
00:50:29.385 --> 00:50:31.887
and the fascists and Nazis
on the other,


825
00:50:32.012 --> 00:50:34.598
they would be finished.

826
00:50:34.723 --> 00:50:38.435
And so, taking a page
from Hitler himself,


827
00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:41.730
they settled upon the idea
of a big lie.


828
00:50:41.855 --> 00:50:46.276
First, they would muddle
the meaning of fascism itself.


829
00:50:46.401 --> 00:50:50.404
They would take the socialism
out of National Socialism.


830
00:50:50.529 --> 00:50:54.575
Second, they would move fascism
from the left-wing column,


831
00:50:54.700 --> 00:50:59.162
where it had always belonged,
into the right-wing column.


832
00:50:59.287 --> 00:51:01.998
But we must not believe
that big lie.


833
00:51:02.123 --> 00:51:05.335
The fascists and the Nazis
were always on the left.


834
00:51:05.460 --> 00:51:08.171
They formed
a mutual admiration society


835
00:51:08.296 --> 00:51:09.881
with the American left.

836
00:51:10.006 --> 00:51:12.216
Even worse,
the most destructive


837
00:51:12.341 --> 00:51:15.552
and genocidal schemes
of the fascists and Nazis


838
00:51:15.677 --> 00:51:18.347
were inspired
by American progressives


839
00:51:18.472 --> 00:51:20.765
and the American
Democratic Party.


840
00:51:20.891 --> 00:51:24.436
That is the crushing
historical truth.


841
00:51:24.561 --> 00:51:28.689
<i>Now we go from the left's
big lie about fascism</i>


842
00:51:28.815 --> 00:51:31.567
to its big lie about racism.

843
00:51:31.692 --> 00:51:34.320
Progressive Democrats
typically blame racism


844
00:51:34.445 --> 00:51:37.030
on America,
and on the founding,


845
00:51:37.156 --> 00:51:40.033
but were the founders to blame
for the elaborate system


846
00:51:40.158 --> 00:51:42.661
of slave plantations?

847
00:51:42.786 --> 00:51:46.372
Historian Allen Guelzo
teaches at Gettysburg College


848
00:51:46.497 --> 00:51:49.208
and is the author
of several award-winning books


849
00:51:49.333 --> 00:51:51.252
on the Civil War.

850
00:51:51.377 --> 00:51:53.128
If we speak
of the founders as a whole,


851
00:51:53.254 --> 00:51:55.881
would it be accurate
to say that they believed A)


852
00:51:56.006 --> 00:51:59.343
slavery is on a path
of extinction;


853
00:51:59.468 --> 00:52:03.096
and B) that slavery is a...

854
00:52:03.221 --> 00:52:05.098
a regrettable thing,
a bad thing?


855
00:52:05.223 --> 00:52:06.849
They were confident

856
00:52:06.975 --> 00:52:08.851
that slavery
was going to disappear,


857
00:52:08.976 --> 00:52:10.519
because it is a contradiction

858
00:52:10.645 --> 00:52:13.397
-of our fundamental principles.
- Are you saying


859
00:52:13.522 --> 00:52:17.151
<i>that there really wasn't a...
formal pro-slavery ideology</i>


860
00:52:17.276 --> 00:52:19.152
at the time of the founding?

861
00:52:19.277 --> 00:52:22.364
There's no
pro-slavery philosophy


862
00:52:22.489 --> 00:52:23.948
that works into the founding.

863
00:52:24.074 --> 00:52:26.200
The founders
took specific measures


864
00:52:26.326 --> 00:52:27.827
to restrict slavery.

865
00:52:27.952 --> 00:52:30.454
They outlawed the slave trade,

866
00:52:30.579 --> 00:52:34.083
they prohibited slavery in
the vast Northwest Territories,


867
00:52:34.208 --> 00:52:36.085
under the Northwest Ordinance,

868
00:52:36.210 --> 00:52:39.171
and they mounted such
a strong critique of slavery


869
00:52:39.296 --> 00:52:41.506
that by the end
of the founding era,


870
00:52:41.631 --> 00:52:43.591
slavery went
from being a national


871
00:52:43.717 --> 00:52:45.593
to a regional institution.

872
00:52:45.718 --> 00:52:47.011
Then this happened.

873
00:52:47.136 --> 00:52:48.679
All over the world, the impact

874
00:52:48.805 --> 00:52:52.224
of this simple invention
was felt almost immediately.


875
00:52:52.349 --> 00:52:55.811
Eli Whitney put together
a few boards and rollers,


876
00:52:55.936 --> 00:52:58.438
and gave the world
a giant industry.


877
00:52:58.563 --> 00:53:00.899
Cotton was king.

878
00:53:02.609 --> 00:53:05.528
This new,
expanded plantation system


879
00:53:05.653 --> 00:53:08.990
demanded a political party
to defend its interests."


880
00:53:09.115 --> 00:53:12.284
the Democratic Party.

881
00:53:12.409 --> 00:53:14.161
At the time of the founders,
they thought slavery


882
00:53:14.286 --> 00:53:15.537
was a dying institution,

883
00:53:15.662 --> 00:53:17.414
but in the 19th century,
that had changed.


884
00:53:17.539 --> 00:53:19.374
They now began
to talk about slavery


885
00:53:19.499 --> 00:53:20.792
as a progressive institution.

886
00:53:20.917 --> 00:53:22.460
And why not?

887
00:53:22.585 --> 00:53:25.296
As George Fitzhugh,
one of the principal


888
00:53:25.421 --> 00:53:28.049
pro-slavery propagandists,
argued:


889
00:53:28.174 --> 00:53:30.509
Isn't slavery the same thing

890
00:53:30.635 --> 00:53:33.637
as what we are reading about
among European socialists?


891
00:53:33.762 --> 00:53:36.932
What else is slavery,
Fitzhugh argued,


892
00:53:37.057 --> 00:53:39.643
but a practical form
of socialism?


893
00:53:41.686 --> 00:53:45.064
Fitzhugh even tried to
sell his idea to black leaders.


894
00:53:45.190 --> 00:53:46.691
He defends slavery

895
00:53:46.816 --> 00:53:49.944
as an early form
of the welfare state.


896
00:53:50.069 --> 00:53:52.446
Fitzhugh argues
that in slavery,


897
00:53:52.571 --> 00:53:54.198
unlike in capitalism,

898
00:53:54.323 --> 00:53:56.158
the slaves who cannot
provide for themselves


899
00:53:56.283 --> 00:54:00.537
are looked after
from cradle to grave.


900
00:54:00.662 --> 00:54:03.331
If you took the logic
of that argument-- the idea


901
00:54:03.456 --> 00:54:06.459
that the slave plantation
is a kind of extended family,


902
00:54:06.584 --> 00:54:08.711
that from each
according to his abilities


903
00:54:08.836 --> 00:54:10.588
to each according to his need--

904
00:54:10.713 --> 00:54:12.173
Marxian principle--

905
00:54:12.298 --> 00:54:14.216
that this was
not only an excuse


906
00:54:14.341 --> 00:54:17.219
for enslaving black people, but
there was nothing in the logic


907
00:54:17.344 --> 00:54:19.513
that prevented you
from enslaving a white guy.


908
00:54:19.638 --> 00:54:21.223
Why not enslave white people?

909
00:54:21.348 --> 00:54:23.892
Or at least reduce them
to an economic status


910
00:54:24.017 --> 00:54:25.476
little better than that.

911
00:54:25.602 --> 00:54:27.061
Why not also extend slavery

912
00:54:27.186 --> 00:54:29.272
into the Northern, free states?

913
00:54:29.397 --> 00:54:31.482
Lincoln thought he discerned

914
00:54:31.607 --> 00:54:33.484
the hand of a plot here.

915
00:54:33.609 --> 00:54:36.612
Would it be accurate to say
that one of the key differences


916
00:54:36.737 --> 00:54:39.031
between the Republican
and the Democratic Party


917
00:54:39.156 --> 00:54:42.409
is that the one party
is founded on the idea


918
00:54:42.534 --> 00:54:45.036
of keeping the fruits
of your labor,


919
00:54:45.161 --> 00:54:46.829
and the other party
is founded on the idea,


920
00:54:46.954 --> 00:54:49.624
we get to take your stuff,
either for our own use


921
00:54:49.749 --> 00:54:52.209
or because we've got
some other, better use for it?


922
00:54:52.334 --> 00:54:55.129
That became the credo
of the Democratic Party.


923
00:54:55.254 --> 00:54:58.340
The great opponent
of the Democratic plantation


924
00:54:58.465 --> 00:55:00.008
was Abraham Lincoln.

925
00:55:00.133 --> 00:55:03.470
In a phrase, Lincoln
described the evil of slavery


926
00:55:03.595 --> 00:55:05.096
at its core.

927
00:55:05.221 --> 00:55:08.224
You toil
and work and earn bread,


928
00:55:08.349 --> 00:55:10.559
<i>and I'll eat it.</i>

929
00:55:10.685 --> 00:55:14.355
Whenever I hear someone
arguing for slavery,


930
00:55:14.480 --> 00:55:17.399
I feel a strong impulse
to see it tried out,


931
00:55:17.524 --> 00:55:19.776
on him personally.

932
00:55:19.901 --> 00:55:22.362
Lincoln ruthlessly exposed

933
00:55:22.487 --> 00:55:25.615
Democratic hypocrisy.

934
00:55:25.740 --> 00:55:28.326
Wolves devouring lambs--

935
00:55:28.451 --> 00:55:31.704
not because it is good
for their own greedy maws,


936
00:55:31.829 --> 00:55:33.831
but because it is good
for the lambs.


937
00:55:33.956 --> 00:55:38.085
<i>For Lincoln,
the fundamental sin of slavery</i>


938
00:55:38.210 --> 00:55:39.461
curiously enough

939
00:55:39.586 --> 00:55:41.880
was not its racial aspect--

940
00:55:42.005 --> 00:55:43.298
that comes after.

941
00:55:43.423 --> 00:55:46.426
The fundamental sin
of slavery is theft.


942
00:55:46.551 --> 00:55:48.427
Because it says:

943
00:55:48.553 --> 00:55:50.680
You work, you toil,

944
00:55:50.805 --> 00:55:53.349
I will take
the proceeds of that.


945
00:55:53.474 --> 00:55:56.018
And Lincoln 's great anxiety
was to point out


946
00:55:56.143 --> 00:55:59.271
how Northern Democrats
had conspired together


947
00:55:59.396 --> 00:56:02.148
with Southern Democrats
to promote justifications


948
00:56:02.274 --> 00:56:06.235
of taking away the fruit
of other people 's labor.


949
00:56:06.361 --> 00:56:09.030
Guelzo is exposing
the progressive strategy


950
00:56:09.155 --> 00:56:11.449
of blaming slavery
on the South.


951
00:56:11.574 --> 00:56:13.784
The Northern Democrats
were in league


952
00:56:13.909 --> 00:56:15.536
with the Southern Democrats,

953
00:56:15.661 --> 00:56:18.413
making slavery the sin
not of the South,


954
00:56:18.538 --> 00:56:22.208
nor of America,
but of the Democratic Party.


955
00:56:22.334 --> 00:56:25.753
Northern Democrats were
fully as complicit in this


956
00:56:25.878 --> 00:56:28.506
as Southern Democrats.

957
00:56:28.631 --> 00:56:31.634
<i>The powerful New York
Democrat Martin Van Buren</i>


958
00:56:31.759 --> 00:56:35.929
applied the idea of rural
plantations in the South


959
00:56:36.054 --> 00:56:39.850
to urban centers in the North.

960
00:56:39.975 --> 00:56:42.310
When new immigrants
came to America,


961
00:56:42.435 --> 00:56:44.979
they were poor,
insecure, desperate.


962
00:56:45.104 --> 00:56:47.648
Some came as
indentured servants.


963
00:56:47.774 --> 00:56:50.192
Like the slave populations
in the South,


964
00:56:50.318 --> 00:56:52.528
they were a vulnerable people.

965
00:56:52.653 --> 00:56:56.657
Van Buren created an army
of big-city bosses,


966
00:56:56.782 --> 00:56:59.993
like Boss Tweed, who ran
Tammany Hall in New York City,


967
00:57:00.118 --> 00:57:01.703
who would raid the treasury

968
00:57:01.828 --> 00:57:05.373
and use the money
to create a patronage system


969
00:57:05.498 --> 00:57:07.375
that would keep
immigrant populations


970
00:57:07.500 --> 00:57:10.544
collectively dependent on,
and voting for,


971
00:57:10.670 --> 00:57:12.588
the Democratic machines,

972
00:57:12.713 --> 00:57:14.965
like in this scene
from Gangs of New York.


973
00:57:15.090 --> 00:57:16.967
...take the chill off your soul

974
00:57:17.092 --> 00:57:18.635
and the weight off your heart.

975
00:57:18.760 --> 00:57:20.512
Welcome to America, son.

976
00:57:20.637 --> 00:57:22.430
Your long,
arduous journey is over.


977
00:57:22.555 --> 00:57:24.099
Go back to your own country!

978
00:57:24.224 --> 00:57:25.266
Vote Tammany!

979
00:57:27.060 --> 00:57:28.811
So, before the Civil War,

980
00:57:28.936 --> 00:57:30.771
the Democrats' majority status

981
00:57:30.896 --> 00:57:34.608
depended upon rural plantations
in the South


982
00:57:34.733 --> 00:57:37.569
and urban plantations
in the North.


983
00:57:39.196 --> 00:57:41.781
Lincoln warned that the goal
of the Democratic Party


984
00:57:41.907 --> 00:57:46.160
was to turn all of America
into a plantation.


985
00:57:46.286 --> 00:57:49.455
To stop Lincoln,
the Democrats went to war.


986
00:57:55.627 --> 00:57:57.879
Lincoln won the war
and demolished


987
00:57:58.005 --> 00:57:59.840
the old Democratic plantation.

988
00:58:01.591 --> 00:58:03.134
Republicans took steps

989
00:58:03.259 --> 00:58:06.763
to integrate former slaves
into American life,


990
00:58:06.888 --> 00:58:10.766
to create for the first time
a multiracial democracy.


991
00:58:10.891 --> 00:58:12.435
Republicans pushed through

992
00:58:12.560 --> 00:58:15.437
three landmark
constitutional amendments,


993
00:58:15.562 --> 00:58:19.107
freeing the slaves,
guaranteeing the right to vote,


994
00:58:19.232 --> 00:58:22.736
and securing equal rights
under the law.


995
00:58:22.861 --> 00:58:25.446
The Democrats overwhelmingly
opposed all three.


996
00:58:25.572 --> 00:58:27.281
And these were
the Northern Democrats.


997
00:58:27.407 --> 00:58:28.741
The Southern Democrats

998
00:58:28.866 --> 00:58:31.911
<i>had not yet been
let back into the Union.</i>


999
00:58:32.036 --> 00:58:33.746
The Democrats needed

1000
00:58:33.871 --> 00:58:35.998
<i>a new enslavement strategy</i>

1001
00:58:36.123 --> 00:58:38.041
and someone to implement it.

1002
00:58:38.166 --> 00:58:40.752
Democratic President
Woodrow Wilson knew


1003
00:58:40.877 --> 00:58:42.837
the national government
had defeated


1004
00:58:42.962 --> 00:58:44.839
the old slave plantation,

1005
00:58:44.964 --> 00:58:47.258
so he and other
progressives wanted


1006
00:58:47.383 --> 00:58:51.095
a new plantation system ruled
by the national government


1007
00:58:51.220 --> 00:58:53.764
so it would last forever.

1008
00:58:53.889 --> 00:58:57.684
federal segregation.

1009
00:58:57.809 --> 00:58:59.519
He forced his departments
to establish


1010
00:58:59.644 --> 00:59:03.273
separate workstations
and restrooms for blacks.


1011
00:59:03.398 --> 00:59:07.902
racial terrorism.

1012
00:59:08.027 --> 00:59:10.696
Wilson screened the film
Birth of a Nation


1013
00:59:10.821 --> 00:59:13.032
in the White House.

1014
00:59:13.157 --> 00:59:17.536
It spurred a national revival
of the Ku Klux Klan.


1015
00:59:17.661 --> 00:59:19.538
The Klan
had previously been confined


1016
00:59:19.663 --> 00:59:21.831
to a handful
of Southern states.


1017
00:59:21.957 --> 00:59:24.667
Now it stretched
from coast to coast.


1018
00:59:24.792 --> 00:59:28.546
The Klan became
the domestic terrorist arm


1019
00:59:28.671 --> 00:59:30.548
of the Democratic Party.

1020
00:59:30.673 --> 00:59:32.800
Wilson was the first
progressive president.


1021
00:59:32.925 --> 00:59:35.302
"Progressive" here
means progress


1022
00:59:35.427 --> 00:59:38.221
toward the powerful
centralized state


1023
00:59:38.347 --> 00:59:41.975
and away from
the American founding.


1024
00:59:42.100 --> 00:59:44.352
In the Democrats'
new plantation scheme,


1025
00:59:44.477 --> 00:59:47.021
the big house
is the White House,


1026
00:59:47.146 --> 00:59:50.858
and the plantation master
is the president.


1027
00:59:56.363 --> 00:59:59.866
Now let's turn
to modern racism,


1028
00:59:59.991 --> 01:00:02.577
racism in the post-war era.

1029
01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:07.540
Here's what the left says:

1030
01:00:07.665 --> 01:00:10.418
The Democrats may have been
the party of racism


1031
01:00:10.543 --> 01:00:12.461
a longtime ago,

1032
01:00:12.586 --> 01:00:14.338
but they underwent
a conversion.


1033
01:00:14.463 --> 01:00:18.383
Now they are the champions
of civil rights.


1034
01:00:18.508 --> 01:00:21.386
The left insists that
in the 1960s,


1035
01:00:21.511 --> 01:00:24.806
the two parties switched sides,

1036
01:00:24.931 --> 01:00:28.351
brought about by Richard
Nixon's Southern strategy.


1037
01:00:28.476 --> 01:00:31.562
Supposedly,
Nixon converted the racists


1038
01:00:31.687 --> 01:00:34.398
in the Democratic Party,
the Dixiecrats,


1039
01:00:34.523 --> 01:00:36.817
into Republicans.

1040
01:00:36.942 --> 01:00:39.403
So, today,
Democrats are the good guys,


1041
01:00:39.528 --> 01:00:42.614
and Trump and the Republicans
are the bad guys.


1042
01:00:42.739 --> 01:00:45.200
Did Nixon have
a campaign strategy


1043
01:00:45.325 --> 01:00:48.286
that appealed to the racists
of the Deep South?


1044
01:00:48.411 --> 01:00:49.787
No one has uncovered

1045
01:00:49.912 --> 01:00:54.208
a single racist
campaign statement by Nixon.


1046
01:00:54.333 --> 01:00:57.377
So the left says
Nixon used crime and drugs


1047
01:00:57.502 --> 01:00:59.963
as a code for racism,

1048
01:01:00.088 --> 01:01:02.340
but in fact,
Nixonian resentment


1049
01:01:02.465 --> 01:01:06.052
was directed against
the Vietnam draft dodgers


1050
01:01:06.177 --> 01:01:09.013
and the militant
anti-war protesters


1051
01:01:09.138 --> 01:01:12.183
and the drug-smoking hippies.

1052
01:01:12.308 --> 01:01:14.226
You might recognize
the unofficial anthem


1053
01:01:14.351 --> 01:01:15.769
of the Nixon voters,

1054
01:01:15.894 --> 01:01:18.438
composed by country singer
Merle Haggard.


1055
01:01:44.212 --> 01:01:45.755
Kevin Phillips, the author

1056
01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:47.924
of The Emerging
Republican Majority,


1057
01:01:48.049 --> 01:01:50.259
is supposed to be the architect

1058
01:01:50.384 --> 01:01:53.012
of Nixon's Southern strategy.

1059
01:01:53.137 --> 01:01:55.222
But Phillips reveals
that Nixon didn't have


1060
01:01:55.347 --> 01:01:57.182
a Southern strategy.

1061
01:01:57.307 --> 01:01:59.559
He had a Sunbelt strategy.

1062
01:01:59.684 --> 01:02:01.770
Nixon wanted to appeal

1063
01:02:01.895 --> 01:02:04.981
to those urban,
upwardly mobile voters


1064
01:02:05.106 --> 01:02:08.276
stretching all the way
from Florida to California.


1065
01:02:08.401 --> 01:02:11.862
This strategy included
the Peripheral or Upper South,


1066
01:02:11.987 --> 01:02:15.532
but it did not include
the Deep South.


1067
01:02:15.657 --> 01:02:17.868
Nixon won the Sunbelt,

1068
01:02:17.993 --> 01:02:20.537
and he lost the Deep South

1069
01:02:20.662 --> 01:02:24.499
<i>to Democratic segregationist
George Wallace.</i>


1070
01:02:24.624 --> 01:02:26.751
One of the first things
Nixon did


1071
01:02:26.876 --> 01:02:30.838
when he took office in 1969
was to introduce


1072
01:02:30.963 --> 01:02:34.008
America's first
affirmative action program.


1073
01:02:34.133 --> 01:02:36.301
President Nixon is helping, uh,

1074
01:02:36.426 --> 01:02:38.970
minority people through his
black entrepreneurship program.


1075
01:02:39.096 --> 01:02:40.972
Now, would a racist president

1076
01:02:41.097 --> 01:02:43.266
playing to a racist base

1077
01:02:43.391 --> 01:02:45.935
give legal preferences
to blacks over whites?


1078
01:02:46.060 --> 01:02:47.520
Absurd.

1079
01:02:47.645 --> 01:02:49.814
And what about
those Dixiecrats?


1080
01:02:49.939 --> 01:02:53.400
How many of them
became Republicans?


1081
01:02:53.525 --> 01:02:56.069
Here is a list of
senators and congressmen


1082
01:02:56.195 --> 01:02:58.322
<i>who joined the Dixiecrat Party</i>

1083
01:02:58.447 --> 01:03:02.158
or voted against
the Civil Rights Act of 1964.


1084
01:03:02.284 --> 01:03:05.286
In the House,
just one switched parties:


1085
01:03:05.411 --> 01:03:06.663
Albert Watson.

1086
01:03:06.788 --> 01:03:08.748
In the Senate, just one:

1087
01:03:08.831 --> 01:03:10.333
Strom Thurmond.

1088
01:03:10.458 --> 01:03:14.461
All the other Dixiecrats
stayed in the Democratic Party.


1089
01:03:14.586 --> 01:03:16.421
They died as Democrats.

1090
01:03:16.547 --> 01:03:17.506
Case in point...

1091
01:03:17.631 --> 01:03:18.840
Today, our country has lost

1092
01:03:18.965 --> 01:03:20.258
a true American original,

1093
01:03:20.383 --> 01:03:23.011
my friend and mentor,
Robert C. Byrd.


1094
01:03:23.136 --> 01:03:24.846
This is the former Klansman

1095
01:03:24.971 --> 01:03:27.765
who led the filibuster
against the Civil Rights Act.


1096
01:03:27.890 --> 01:03:30.893
Obama and Bill Clinton
attended his memorial service.


1097
01:03:31.018 --> 01:03:34.063
They mention that he once had
a fleeting association


1098
01:03:34.188 --> 01:03:35.731
with the Ku Klux Klan.

1099
01:03:35.856 --> 01:03:37.941
And what does that mean?
I'll tell you what it means.


1100
01:03:38.066 --> 01:03:40.152
He was a country boy
from the hills and the hollows


1101
01:03:40.277 --> 01:03:43.363
of West Virginia.
He was trying to get elected.


1102
01:03:43.488 --> 01:03:46.824
The South's enduring
shift into the Republican camp


1103
01:03:46.949 --> 01:03:50.661
came not in the Nixon
but in the Reagan era.


1104
01:03:50.786 --> 01:03:54.164
Reagan defended patriotism,
free markets,


1105
01:03:54.290 --> 01:03:56.166
family values,
religious liberty.


1106
01:03:56.291 --> 01:03:57.834
He was pro-life.

1107
01:03:57.960 --> 01:04:00.587
It had nothing to do with race.

1108
01:04:00.712 --> 01:04:03.590
As the South
became less racist,


1109
01:04:03.715 --> 01:04:06.009
it became more Republican.

1110
01:04:06.134 --> 01:04:08.469
So, the progressive
Democratic claim


1111
01:04:08.594 --> 01:04:10.638
that the parties switched sides

1112
01:04:10.763 --> 01:04:12.973
and the Democrats
are now the good guys


1113
01:04:13.098 --> 01:04:15.017
and Republicans
are the bad guys


1114
01:04:15.142 --> 01:04:17.603
is a big lie.

1115
01:04:17.728 --> 01:04:20.355
Time to fast-forward
to the present.


1116
01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:23.566
The Democrats
have just one card left,


1117
01:04:23.691 --> 01:04:24.984
Charlottesville.

1118
01:04:37.496 --> 01:04:40.624
There they are,
white supremacists


1119
01:04:40.749 --> 01:04:42.459
<i>and nee
-Nazis in Trump hats.</i>

1120
01:04:42.584 --> 01:04:46.838
Doesn't that prove that racism
today is on the right?


1121
01:04:46.963 --> 01:04:49.674
Jason Kessler organized
the Charlottesville rally.


1122
01:04:49.799 --> 01:04:51.509
He is routinely portrayed

1123
01:04:51.634 --> 01:04:54.386
as a white supremacist
and a right-winger.


1124
01:04:54.511 --> 01:04:56.722
But when
the Southern Poverty Law Center


1125
01:04:56.847 --> 01:04:58.557
looked into his past,

1126
01:04:58.682 --> 01:05:00.976
they found an Obama supporter

1127
01:05:01.101 --> 01:05:04.604
who was active in
the left-wing Occupy movement.


1128
01:05:04.729 --> 01:05:07.231
I exposed this on social media.

1129
01:05:07.357 --> 01:05:09.066
<i>He didn't '1' like it.</i>

1130
01:05:09.192 --> 01:05:11.277
Dinesh, you.
You go back to India.


1131
01:05:11.402 --> 01:05:12.611
You shouldn't be here.

1132
01:05:12.736 --> 01:05:14.613
Number one,
you were born in India,


1133
01:05:14.738 --> 01:05:16.949
and you're just like
the other people coming over


1134
01:05:17.074 --> 01:05:19.242
on these H1B1 visas.

1135
01:05:19.368 --> 01:05:22.078
"Hello, sir.
Uh, how are you doing today?"


1136
01:05:22.203 --> 01:05:23.747
We don't need you, okay?

1137
01:05:23.872 --> 01:05:26.165
But what does Kessler believe?

1138
01:05:26.291 --> 01:05:28.751
I mean, there is
a problem with bankers.


1139
01:05:28.876 --> 01:05:30.836
There is a problem
with the wealthiest people


1140
01:05:30.961 --> 01:05:32.088
in this country...

1141
01:05:32.213 --> 01:05:33.339
He still seems to me

1142
01:05:33.464 --> 01:05:35.674
to be pan'
of that Occupy movement.


1143
01:05:35.799 --> 01:05:37.509
I decided to talk to someone

1144
01:05:37.634 --> 01:05:39.761
even more notorious
than Kessler,


1145
01:05:39.886 --> 01:05:42.847
the poster boy
of white supremacy.


1146
01:05:42.972 --> 01:05:45.642
Hail our people. Hail victory!

1147
01:05:53.774 --> 01:05:56.735
Protests over Richard Spencer's
visit turning violent.


1148
01:05:56.860 --> 01:05:59.279
White nationalist
Richard Spencer


1149
01:05:59.404 --> 01:06:01.740
is speaking
at the University of Florida.


1150
01:06:01.865 --> 01:06:03.324
The Governor Rick Scott
did declare


1151
01:06:03.450 --> 01:06:05.285
a state of an emergency.

1152
01:06:05.410 --> 01:06:07.537
- Pepe's become kind of a symbol...
- Oh!


1153
01:06:07.662 --> 01:06:09.121
Africans have benefited

1154
01:06:09.247 --> 01:06:11.749
from their experience
with white supremacy.


1155
01:06:11.874 --> 01:06:13.584
- You're a bigot.
- If Africans had never existed,


1156
01:06:13.709 --> 01:06:15.878
world history would be ex...
almost exactly the same


1157
01:06:16.003 --> 01:06:17.879
-as it is today.
- Yeah, you just keep saying...


1158
01:06:18.005 --> 01:06:19.464
Because we are the genius
that drives it.


1159
01:06:19.589 --> 01:06:20.799
You keep saying
ignorant things.


1160
01:06:20.924 --> 01:06:22.884
You don't get to tell me
what I will be.


1161
01:06:23.009 --> 01:06:24.969
Yeah, I do, actually. Because
my name's Richard Spencer.


1162
01:06:25.094 --> 01:06:28.222
Richard Spencer, founder of the
so-called alt-right movement...


1163
01:06:28.347 --> 01:06:30.725
Their movement is broadly
referred to as "alt-right."


1164
01:06:30.850 --> 01:06:33.852
Richard Spencer, a prominent
member of the alt-right...


1165
01:06:33.978 --> 01:06:36.396
What does Richard
Spencer actually believe?


1166
01:06:36.522 --> 01:06:38.315
People have called you a Nazi.

1167
01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:40.275
Uh, are you a Nazi?

1168
01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:42.110
Oh, no, l-l'm not a Nazi.

1169
01:06:42.235 --> 01:06:44.320
I'm not a neo-Nazi.
I'm not any of those things.


1170
01:06:44.445 --> 01:06:48.324
Now, you say you're not
a neo-Nazi or a Nazi, and yet,


1171
01:06:48.449 --> 01:06:50.826
in the event that you had
right around the time


1172
01:06:50.951 --> 01:06:54.079
-of Trump's inauguration...
- Mm-hmm.


1173
01:06:54.204 --> 01:06:56.457
...there were a whole bunch
of guys who were giving


1174
01:06:56.582 --> 01:06:58.625
the Nazi salute.
You saw them.


1175
01:06:58.750 --> 01:07:00.335
- Sure.
- You didn't repudiate them.


1176
01:07:00.460 --> 01:07:02.879
- No.
- So you thought it was okay


1177
01:07:03.004 --> 01:07:05.089
to have some Nazi salutes

1178
01:07:05.215 --> 01:07:08.050
that... in response
to what you were saying.


1179
01:07:08.176 --> 01:07:09.677
Um, I uttered the words,

1180
01:07:09.802 --> 01:07:12.888
"Hail Trump, hail our people,
hail victory."


1181
01:07:13.013 --> 01:07:17.351
Doesn't "Hail Trump" sound
unnervingly like "Heil Hitler"?


1182
01:07:17.476 --> 01:07:18.894
Uh, sure. It was...
I was being


1183
01:07:19.019 --> 01:07:20.187
-very provocative.
-Isn't that why you...


1184
01:07:20.312 --> 01:07:21.271
You were being provocative.

1185
01:07:21.396 --> 01:07:22.689
Isn't it fair to say

1186
01:07:22.814 --> 01:07:24.524
that you're... that you know

1187
01:07:24.649 --> 01:07:27.902
that there is a...
a media left out there


1188
01:07:28.027 --> 01:07:29.862
that is looking

1189
01:07:29.987 --> 01:07:33.199
to pin neo
-Nazism on the right,

1190
01:07:33.324 --> 01:07:35.200
and by doing
this kind of thing,


1191
01:07:35.325 --> 01:07:37.744
you're actually playing a part

1192
01:07:37.869 --> 01:07:40.539
in a script, you're actually
giving them what they want,


1193
01:07:40.664 --> 01:07:42.666
which gives you
a lot of media attention,


1194
01:07:42.791 --> 01:07:44.626
it serves their script,

1195
01:07:44.751 --> 01:07:48.087
-but it actually hurts Trump?
- Uh, no,


1196
01:07:48.212 --> 01:07:50.089
I don't think the alt-right
has hurt Trump


1197
01:07:50.214 --> 01:07:52.675
-in the slightest bit.
- Would it be fair to say


1198
01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:54.677
that you are not just
against illegal immigration,


1199
01:07:54.802 --> 01:07:56.595
but immigration, period?

1200
01:07:56.720 --> 01:07:59.264
I would be actually happy
to open the door


1201
01:07:59.389 --> 01:08:00.807
to white South Africans.

1202
01:08:00.932 --> 01:08:03.059
Would you be happy
with an immigration policy


1203
01:08:03.184 --> 01:08:04.519
that basically said,

1204
01:08:04.644 --> 01:08:08.314
"We want people
from New Zealand, Australia,


1205
01:08:08.439 --> 01:08:10.608
"uh, white guys from Europe,

1206
01:08:10.733 --> 01:08:13.194
"Iceland and South Africa;

1207
01:08:13.319 --> 01:08:15.279
"we don't want
that many people


1208
01:08:15.404 --> 01:08:18.615
-from, if any,
Barbados or Bombay"? -Yes.


1209
01:08:18.740 --> 01:08:21.034
Now, this seems very different
than... than Trump.


1210
01:08:21.159 --> 01:08:24.037
And by that, I mean,
isn't it true that the line


1211
01:08:24.162 --> 01:08:27.040
that Trump is drawing
is not a racial line


1212
01:08:27.165 --> 01:08:30.084
but a line between the legal
and the illegal immigrant?


1213
01:08:30.209 --> 01:08:31.585
He's... he's made
a difference between


1214
01:08:31.710 --> 01:08:32.878
the illegal and legal, sure.

1215
01:08:33.003 --> 01:08:34.755
But I ultimately
don't support that.


1216
01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:37.299
Trump was quoted
in the paper as saying:


1217
01:08:37.424 --> 01:08:40.302
If there's an Indian guy
working in Silicon Valley,


1218
01:08:40.427 --> 01:08:45.223
and his visa runs out
and we have to send him home,


1219
01:08:45.348 --> 01:08:48.101
that's a loss, that's something
we should try to prevent.


1220
01:08:48.226 --> 01:08:50.645
- You disagree?
- I do disagree with that.


1221
01:08:50.770 --> 01:08:53.022
The H1B visa program

1222
01:08:53.147 --> 01:08:56.942
has been totally detrimental
to white people.


1223
01:08:57.067 --> 01:08:59.319
In Richard Spencer's world,
what would you do


1224
01:08:59.444 --> 01:09:00.987
with non-white immigrants
who are here?


1225
01:09:01.112 --> 01:09:02.781
- Uh-huh.
- Good example would be me.


1226
01:09:02.906 --> 01:09:05.783
I'm a naturalized U.S. citizen.
Would you send me home?


1227
01:09:05.909 --> 01:09:08.244
I hope that
we can begin to pursue


1228
01:09:08.369 --> 01:09:11.038
a new policy of re-immigration.

1229
01:09:11.163 --> 01:09:13.582
And that would be
about allowing people


1230
01:09:13.707 --> 01:09:15.042
to go home again.

1231
01:09:15.167 --> 01:09:18.003
I mean, I hear you echoing

1232
01:09:18.128 --> 01:09:19.755
a white Malcolm X philosophy.

1233
01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:21.840
<i><i>Is it fair to say,</i></i>

1234
01:09:21.965 --> 01:09:25.176
as a generality and as a...
succinct way to put it,


1235
01:09:25.301 --> 01:09:27.553
that you believe
in segregation of the races?


1236
01:09:27.678 --> 01:09:29.347
We do believe in separation.

1237
01:09:29.472 --> 01:09:30.765
Standing on our own feet,

1238
01:09:30.890 --> 01:09:32.391
among our...
among our own kind,


1239
01:09:32.516 --> 01:09:34.018
and solving our own problems.

1240
01:09:34.143 --> 01:09:36.186
And that's the only way
you'll get a solution


1241
01:09:36.311 --> 01:09:38.897
to the vital race problem
in this country.


1242
01:09:39.022 --> 01:09:42.275
Mr. Muhammad teaches us
to love our own kind


1243
01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:44.444
and let the white man
take care of himself.


1244
01:09:44.569 --> 01:09:47.071
And so, if you and Malcolm X
were at the table,


1245
01:09:47.196 --> 01:09:49.073
you'd get along just fine.

1246
01:09:49.198 --> 01:09:50.783
I think we could have
a respectful dialogue


1247
01:09:50.908 --> 01:09:52.785
if Malcolm X were at the table.

1248
01:09:52.910 --> 01:09:55.871
Do you agree that
what you're articulating


1249
01:09:55.996 --> 01:09:58.999
is a philosophy
that was very prevalent


1250
01:09:59.124 --> 01:10:00.667
among, really,
progressive Democrats


1251
01:10:00.792 --> 01:10:02.460
in the early 20th century?

1252
01:10:02.585 --> 01:10:05.380
I
-I am sure there are instances

1253
01:10:05.505 --> 01:10:09.675
in which left-wing thinkers
or entities


1254
01:10:09.800 --> 01:10:11.761
adopted nationalism.

1255
01:10:11.886 --> 01:10:13.846
What it means to be
on the right, what it means


1256
01:10:13.971 --> 01:10:16.890
to be a conservative, is
actually deeply collectivist.


1257
01:10:17.015 --> 01:10:18.642
It is not individualistic
at all.


1258
01:10:18.767 --> 01:10:21.019
Pause for a moment. So, as--
I would say-- as a conservative,


1259
01:10:21.144 --> 01:10:23.063
I'm conserving...

1260
01:10:23.188 --> 01:10:25.398
the philosophy
and the principles


1261
01:10:25.523 --> 01:10:27.525
of the American founding--
you're not?


1262
01:10:27.650 --> 01:10:29.735
I've been critical
of the American founding,


1263
01:10:29.860 --> 01:10:32.530
and throughout my writings
and my career, sure.


1264
01:10:32.655 --> 01:10:34.573
Uh, what's... what was wrong
with the American founding?


1265
01:10:34.698 --> 01:10:36.909
This notion that
we will create a state


1266
01:10:37.034 --> 01:10:39.453
to protect human rights
or-or individual rights.


1267
01:10:39.578 --> 01:10:41.788
I mean, no state
in the history of the world,


1268
01:10:41.913 --> 01:10:44.249
including the United States,
was ever created like that.


1269
01:10:44.374 --> 01:10:47.752
So all men are created equal.
True or false?


1270
01:10:47.877 --> 01:10:50.046
- False, obviously.
- What about the idea that...


1271
01:10:50.171 --> 01:10:51.964
No...! one actually believes that.

1272
01:10:52.089 --> 01:10:53.966
I mean, seriously.
No...! one believes that.


1273
01:10:54.091 --> 01:10:55.259
The idea that, let's say,

1274
01:10:55.384 --> 01:10:57.010
we have a right to life.
True or false?


1275
01:10:57.135 --> 01:10:58.679
A ri...
I don't think we have rights


1276
01:10:58.804 --> 01:11:00.222
to, really, anything.

1277
01:11:00.347 --> 01:11:02.557
I don't think we
should ever pledge allegiance


1278
01:11:02.682 --> 01:11:05.435
or worship legal documents.

1279
01:11:05.560 --> 01:11:08.146
And would you agree
that at the end of the day


1280
01:11:08.271 --> 01:11:10.940
it is the individual
who serves the state


1281
01:11:11.065 --> 01:11:12.942
and not the other way around?

1282
01:11:13.067 --> 01:11:15.819
There are duties
that we have to the state.


1283
01:11:15.944 --> 01:11:18.238
But this notion of a limited
government which, you know,


1284
01:11:18.363 --> 01:11:20.282
as you know,
the founders saw the government


1285
01:11:20.407 --> 01:11:22.075
as the enemy of our rights.

1286
01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:23.910
- Uh, in other words...
- Not really.


1287
01:11:24.035 --> 01:11:25.620
- Well, look at the...
- That's Reaganism.


1288
01:11:25.745 --> 01:11:27.038
Well, let's look
at the Bill of Rights.


1289
01:11:27.163 --> 01:11:28.498
Congress shall make no law
doing this,


1290
01:11:28.623 --> 01:11:30.207
and Congress
shall make no law doing that.


1291
01:11:30.333 --> 01:11:32.001
So our rights--
our First Amendment right,


1292
01:11:32.084 --> 01:11:33.752
our Second Amendment right,
to own a gun,


1293
01:11:33.877 --> 01:11:35.004
our Fourth Amendment right--

1294
01:11:35.129 --> 01:11:37.381
are seen as protections

1295
01:11:37.506 --> 01:11:38.382
against a government.

1296
01:11:38.507 --> 01:11:40.634
No...! individual has a right

1297
01:11:40.759 --> 01:11:42.969
outside
of a collective community.


1298
01:11:43.094 --> 01:11:45.096
You have rights

1299
01:11:45.221 --> 01:11:48.224
not eternally or given by God
or by nature...


1300
01:11:48.349 --> 01:11:50.351
- Who gives them to us?
- Ult... You have them


1301
01:11:50.476 --> 01:11:52.645
because you are part
of this community.


1302
01:11:52.770 --> 01:11:54.688
Ultimately, the state
gives those rights to you.


1303
01:11:54.813 --> 01:11:57.024
So the state is the source
of rights, not the individual.


1304
01:11:57.149 --> 01:11:58.650
It simply is.

1305
01:11:58.775 --> 01:12:00.569
What would be your take
on, say, Reagan?


1306
01:12:00.694 --> 01:12:02.028
I do not think that
he was a great president.


1307
01:12:02.153 --> 01:12:03.655
Who's your favorite president?

1308
01:12:03.780 --> 01:12:06.407
There is something
about, uh, Jackson.


1309
01:12:06.532 --> 01:12:08.701
There's something
about Polk as well,


1310
01:12:08.826 --> 01:12:10.870
someone who
only served one term.


1311
01:12:10.995 --> 01:12:13.205
But, I mean, Jackson and Polk,
as you know, both Democrats.


1312
01:12:13.330 --> 01:12:15.165
Uh,party

1313
01:12:15.290 --> 01:12:19.586
I mean, party is just the...
the vessel that-that one uses.


1314
01:12:19.711 --> 01:12:22.088
I mean, Jackson's the founder
of the Democratic Party.


1315
01:12:22.213 --> 01:12:25.675
You can find, perhaps,
elective affinities,


1316
01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:28.636
uh, perhaps kind of
ironic affin... affinities


1317
01:12:28.761 --> 01:12:32.098
between myself
as an identitarian


1318
01:12:32.223 --> 01:12:36.059
and a progressive Democrat
from the 1920s or something.


1319
01:12:36.185 --> 01:12:38.186
Have you seen the movie
Birth of a Nation?


1320
01:12:38.312 --> 01:12:40.480
- Uh, yes, I have.
- What do you think of it?


1321
01:12:40.605 --> 01:12:42.482
Uh, it's an amazing film.

1322
01:12:42.607 --> 01:12:44.776
One of the most
important films ever made.


1323
01:12:44.901 --> 01:12:46.611
Certainly a racialist
component to that.


1324
01:12:46.736 --> 01:12:49.614
It appealed to many Americans,
including many presidents.


1325
01:12:49.739 --> 01:12:51.699
- It was screened in the...
- Right, well, that's my point,


1326
01:12:51.824 --> 01:12:53.867
is that-that a progressive
Democrat, Woodrow Wilson,


1327
01:12:53.993 --> 01:12:55.661
shows that movie
in the White House


1328
01:12:55.786 --> 01:12:59.498
to the cabinet, and this leads
to a kind of Klan revival


1329
01:12:59.623 --> 01:13:00.665
around the country.

1330
01:13:00.790 --> 01:13:03.585
So you see why I'm placing you

1331
01:13:03.710 --> 01:13:06.087
in that tradition?

1332
01:13:06.212 --> 01:13:08.381
Because those are...
that's your team.


1333
01:13:08.506 --> 01:13:10.800
Uh... if that's progressivism,

1334
01:13:10.925 --> 01:13:13.135
then I guess I'm a progressive.

1335
01:13:13.260 --> 01:13:14.720
Uh, I'm
-I'm fine with that.

1336
01:13:14.845 --> 01:13:16.638
Uh, International Socialism?

1337
01:13:16.763 --> 01:13:20.350
Uh, I'm... to be honest, uh,
l-l'm not totally opposed


1338
01:13:20.475 --> 01:13:23.228
to socialism when...
when done right.


1339
01:13:23.353 --> 01:13:25.980
Uh, I think we actually
should use the government


1340
01:13:26.105 --> 01:13:28.065
to benefit ourselves,
the people of this country.


1341
01:13:28.191 --> 01:13:30.818
I think we should have
a national health care system,


1342
01:13:30.943 --> 01:13:33.571
I think we should quadruple
national parks,


1343
01:13:33.696 --> 01:13:36.740
I think we should make
this world a better place.


1344
01:13:36.865 --> 01:13:39.326
And I think government has
a role to play in that.


1345
01:13:39.451 --> 01:13:40.744
Now, there's very little

1346
01:13:40.869 --> 01:13:43.747
on which Spencer and Trump
actually agree.


1347
01:13:43.872 --> 01:13:45.248
Trump's a flag-waving patriot

1348
01:13:45.373 --> 01:13:47.375
who cherishes
the American founders.


1349
01:13:47.500 --> 01:13:49.919
Spencer isn't and doesn't.

1350
01:13:50.044 --> 01:13:52.004
Trump's
a free-market capitalist.


1351
01:13:52.129 --> 01:13:55.049
Spencer prefers
a strong centralized state


1352
01:13:55.174 --> 01:13:58.927
regulating markets
and dispensing entitlements.


1353
01:13:59.052 --> 01:14:00.887
Trump wants
to keep illegals out


1354
01:14:01.012 --> 01:14:02.514
so legal immigrants
and citizens,


1355
01:14:02.639 --> 01:14:04.766
whether white, black or brown,
can thrive.


1356
01:14:04.891 --> 01:14:06.768
No...! matter where they come from,

1357
01:14:06.893 --> 01:14:10.646
no matter
what faith they practice,


1358
01:14:10.771 --> 01:14:12.690
they form a single,

1359
01:14:12.815 --> 01:14:14.358
unbreakable team.

1360
01:14:14.483 --> 01:14:16.360
That's what we are--
we're a team.


1361
01:14:16.485 --> 01:14:18.737
As a nation, we're a team.

1362
01:14:18.862 --> 01:14:21.573
Spencer wants
only white immigrants.


1363
01:14:21.698 --> 01:14:23.825
Trump believes that rights
come from God.


1364
01:14:23.950 --> 01:14:26.619
No matter
what the color of our skin


1365
01:14:26.744 --> 01:14:28.621
or the place of our birth,

1366
01:14:28.746 --> 01:14:30.956
we are all
created equal by God.


1367
01:14:31.082 --> 01:14:33.083
Spencer is an atheist

1368
01:14:33.209 --> 01:14:35.753
who believes our rights
come from the government.


1369
01:14:35.878 --> 01:14:38.839
They call him alt-right,

1370
01:14:38.964 --> 01:14:40.799
but he's not on the right.

1371
01:14:40.924 --> 01:14:42.133
He's not a conservative.

1372
01:14:42.258 --> 01:14:44.135
He's a tool of the media

1373
01:14:44.260 --> 01:14:46.262
to pin
the white supremacist tail


1374
01:14:46.387 --> 01:14:48.806
on the Republican elephant.

1375
01:14:48.931 --> 01:14:51.642
He's pan' of the big lie.

1376
01:14:56.939 --> 01:14:59.024
We've talked
about the racist history


1377
01:14:59.149 --> 01:15:01.318
of the Democratic Party,
stretching all the way


1378
01:15:01.443 --> 01:15:05.238
to the present,
but where's the racism now?


1379
01:15:05.363 --> 01:15:07.115
The Democratic
ethnic plantation


1380
01:15:07.240 --> 01:15:11.452
has expanded greatly
under Clinton and Obama.


1381
01:15:12.870 --> 01:15:15.039
The historian Kenneth Stampp

1382
01:15:15.164 --> 01:15:18.000
identifies the five
distinctive features


1383
01:15:18.125 --> 01:15:21.044
of the slave plantation.

1384
01:15:21.169 --> 01:15:23.630
Dilapidated housing.

1385
01:15:23.755 --> 01:15:25.632
Broken families.

1386
01:15:25.757 --> 01:15:28.050
A high degree of violence

1387
01:15:28.176 --> 01:15:32.096
necessary to keep
the plantation together.


1388
01:15:32.221 --> 01:15:34.264
No opportunity;
no one gets ahead.


1389
01:15:34.390 --> 01:15:39.728
And a pervasive atmosphere
of nihilism and despair.


1390
01:15:39.853 --> 01:15:42.897
Today, we find
those exact features


1391
01:15:43.023 --> 01:15:46.818
in almost every city
the Democrats control--


1392
01:15:46.943 --> 01:15:48.653
in the black ghetto,

1393
01:15:48.778 --> 01:15:51.155
the Latino barrio,

1394
01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:53.866
and on the Native American
reservations.


1395
01:15:57.119 --> 01:16:00.455
This is racism 's
contemporary face.


1396
01:16:00.580 --> 01:16:02.749
Democrats try
to deflect attention


1397
01:16:02.874 --> 01:16:06.210
to a few powerless
white nationalists


1398
01:16:06.336 --> 01:16:09.714
so that we'll miss the racism
that is institutionalized


1399
01:16:09.839 --> 01:16:13.008
within the modern
Democratic plantation.


1400
01:16:13.133 --> 01:16:15.969
Trump, far from being
the problem,


1401
01:16:16.094 --> 01:16:17.971
is actually
making things better.


1402
01:16:18.096 --> 01:16:19.973
African
-American unemployment

1403
01:16:20.098 --> 01:16:23.059
stands at the lowest rate
ever recorded.


1404
01:16:24.769 --> 01:16:29.732
...to make America great again
for all Americans.


1405
01:16:33.694 --> 01:16:35.904
And watch the reaction

1406
01:16:36.029 --> 01:16:40.283
on the part of the overseers
of the Democratic plantation.


1407
01:16:43.661 --> 01:16:46.748
And where's the fascism today?
It's not Trump.


1408
01:16:46.873 --> 01:16:50.293
He's an American nationalist
who wants capitalism,


1409
01:16:50.418 --> 01:16:52.670
limited government,
individual liberty


1410
01:16:52.795 --> 01:16:54.380
and free speech.

1411
01:16:54.505 --> 01:16:57.633
And nothing is more
anti-fascist than that.


1412
01:16:57.758 --> 01:16:59.885
By contrast, under Obama,

1413
01:17:00.010 --> 01:17:03.013
we saw government control
increase dramatically


1414
01:17:03.138 --> 01:17:05.139
over banks,
investment companies,


1415
01:17:05.265 --> 01:17:08.851
energy companies,
the entire health care sector


1416
01:17:08.976 --> 01:17:10.561
and education.

1417
01:17:10.686 --> 01:17:13.439
This is state-run capitalism,

1418
01:17:13.564 --> 01:17:17.359
which is the clinical
definition of fascism.


1419
01:17:17.484 --> 01:17:20.904
A second manifestation
of fascism today


1420
01:17:21.029 --> 01:17:23.573
is the deep state.

1421
01:17:23.698 --> 01:17:26.576
The Democratic Party,
under Obama and Hillary,


1422
01:17:26.701 --> 01:17:28.953
used the weapons of the state--

1423
01:17:29.078 --> 01:17:32.957
the IRS, the FBI, the CIA,
the Justice Department--


1424
01:17:33.082 --> 01:17:35.334
against their
political opponents.


1425
01:17:35.459 --> 01:17:37.461
I saw this with my own eyes.

1426
01:17:37.586 --> 01:17:39.337
The gangsterization
of the U.S. government


1427
01:17:39.463 --> 01:17:41.506
and of American politics.

1428
01:17:41.631 --> 01:17:45.051
This is about as close
as you can get


1429
01:17:45.176 --> 01:17:47.762
to institutional fascism.

1430
01:17:49.889 --> 01:17:52.266
And what about
the fascist insistence


1431
01:17:52.391 --> 01:17:54.351
on cultural conformity,

1432
01:17:54.476 --> 01:17:57.813
what the Nazis called
Gleichshaltung?


1433
01:17:57.938 --> 01:18:01.233
Today's left calls this
"political correctness."


1434
01:18:01.358 --> 01:18:04.319
They use political correctness
to establish


1435
01:18:04.444 --> 01:18:06.904
a stranglehold over academia,

1436
01:18:07.030 --> 01:18:09.949
the media, entertainment.

1437
01:18:10.074 --> 01:18:12.118
This enforced monopoly of views

1438
01:18:12.243 --> 01:18:14.244
is also an example

1439
01:18:14.370 --> 01:18:17.331
of fascism on the left today.

1440
01:18:20.167 --> 01:18:22.669
James O'Keefe is
the founder and president


1441
01:18:22.794 --> 01:18:24.337
of Project Veritas,

1442
01:18:24.462 --> 01:18:27.632
a group with
an unusual mission.


1443
01:18:27.757 --> 01:18:30.468
The media
has protected the sacred cows--


1444
01:18:30.593 --> 01:18:32.470
the Planned Parenthoods,
the NPRs,


1445
01:18:32.595 --> 01:18:34.305
the ACORNs, and now Antifa--

1446
01:18:34.430 --> 01:18:36.140
and they've only given you
half the story.


1447
01:18:36.265 --> 01:18:37.349
So, in order to expose

1448
01:18:37.474 --> 01:18:39.267
the truth, we have to dig deep.

1449
01:18:39.393 --> 01:18:40.727
We have to go undercover

1450
01:18:40.852 --> 01:18:42.687
to unmask
what they really believe.


1451
01:18:42.812 --> 01:18:46.065
What would you say
is the ideology of Antifa?


1452
01:18:46.190 --> 01:18:47.692
Well, they don't believe
in free speech.


1453
01:18:47.817 --> 01:18:49.318
They don't believe in
the democratic process.


1454
01:18:49.443 --> 01:18:51.028
They don't believe
in individual rights.


1455
01:18:51.153 --> 01:18:52.988
They don't believe in...
anyone has a right


1456
01:18:53.113 --> 01:18:54.615
to express themselves
or even exist


1457
01:18:54.740 --> 01:18:56.867
if it doesn't...
if it isn't consistent


1458
01:18:56.992 --> 01:18:59.077
with their sort of
revolutionary actions.


1459
01:18:59.202 --> 01:19:01.246
In our undercover journalism,
they actually joke


1460
01:19:01.371 --> 01:19:03.456
about the fact
that it's not self-defense.


1461
01:19:03.581 --> 01:19:06.084
Now, if I think
of paramilitary organizations


1462
01:19:06.209 --> 01:19:07.794
that don't believe

1463
01:19:07.919 --> 01:19:11.130
in free speech or tolerance
or the democratic process,


1464
01:19:11.255 --> 01:19:13.465
I think
of not just the Communists,


1465
01:19:13.591 --> 01:19:15.050
but the fascists.

1466
01:19:15.175 --> 01:19:17.219
And yet here is an organization

1467
01:19:17.344 --> 01:19:19.596
that purports to be
anti-fascist.


1468
01:19:19.721 --> 01:19:22.098
Yeah, I think they have
a lot more in common


1469
01:19:22.223 --> 01:19:23.933
with the Mussolinis,
the Brownshirts.


1470
01:19:24.058 --> 01:19:25.643
In our undercover tapes,

1471
01:19:25.768 --> 01:19:27.478
they're wearing black masks.

1472
01:19:27.603 --> 01:19:30.189
That bears a lot more in common
with the fascism of, uh,


1473
01:19:30.314 --> 01:19:33.484
the early 20th century than
they would have you believe.


1474
01:19:33.609 --> 01:19:36.945
Who is fueling or funding

1475
01:19:37.070 --> 01:19:39.489
the groups
loosely called Antifa?


1476
01:19:39.614 --> 01:19:42.075
Torn Steyer's name
came up a lot in California.


1477
01:19:42.200 --> 01:19:43.660
He's a billionaire.

1478
01:19:43.785 --> 01:19:46.162
Another name
that's come up publicly--


1479
01:19:46.287 --> 01:19:48.414
uh, open-source records--
has been


1480
01:19:48.539 --> 01:19:50.333
George Soros.

1481
01:19:50.458 --> 01:19:54.545
George Soros is one of
the richest men in the world.


1482
01:19:54.670 --> 01:19:57.923
He styles himself
as anti-fascist,


1483
01:19:58.006 --> 01:20:01.134
but his own history has
a different story to tell.


1484
01:20:01.259 --> 01:20:03.178
When the Nazis

1485
01:20:03.303 --> 01:20:05.888
occupied Budapest in 1944,

1486
01:20:06.014 --> 01:20:08.599
George Soros's father
was a successful lawyer.


1487
01:20:08.724 --> 01:20:10.810
He lived on an island
in the Danube


1488
01:20:10.935 --> 01:20:13.312
<i>and liked to commute to work
in</i> a <i>rowboat.</i>


1489
01:20:13.437 --> 01:20:15.731
But knowing there were problems
ahead for the Jews,


1490
01:20:15.856 --> 01:20:17.899
he decided
to split his family up.


1491
01:20:25.240 --> 01:20:27.492
No...!!

1492
01:20:46.718 --> 01:20:48.344
And he bribed
a government official


1493
01:20:48.469 --> 01:20:50.805
to take 14-year-old
George Soros in


1494
01:20:50.930 --> 01:20:53.599
and swear that he was
his Christian godson.


1495
01:20:53.724 --> 01:20:56.268
But survival carried
a heavy price tag.


1496
01:20:56.393 --> 01:20:58.395
While hundreds of thousands
of Hungarian Jews


1497
01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:00.856
were being shipped off
to the death camps,


1498
01:21:00.981 --> 01:21:03.274
George Soros accompanied
his phony godfather


1499
01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:05.276
on his appointed rounds,

1500
01:21:05.401 --> 01:21:07.820
confiscating property
from the Jews.


1501
01:21:07.945 --> 01:21:09.822
I was 14 years old.

1502
01:21:09.947 --> 01:21:12.533
And I would say that that's
when my character was made.


1503
01:21:12.658 --> 01:21:14.410
- In what way?
- That one should think ahead,


1504
01:21:14.535 --> 01:21:18.997
one should understand
and-and anticipate events.


1505
01:21:26.254 --> 01:21:28.089
My understanding is,
is that you went out


1506
01:21:28.214 --> 01:21:30.341
with this protector of yours

1507
01:21:30.466 --> 01:21:32.968
who swore that you were,

1508
01:21:33.093 --> 01:21:35.429
-uh, his adopted godson.
- Yes, yes, yes.


1509
01:21:35.554 --> 01:21:38.640
Went out, in fact, and helped
in the confiscation of property


1510
01:21:38.765 --> 01:21:40.225
-from the Jews.
- That's right.


1511
01:21:40.350 --> 01:21:42.727
- Yes.
- But that-that sounds,


1512
01:21:42.852 --> 01:21:47.648
uh, like an experience
that would send lots of people


1513
01:21:47.774 --> 01:21:51.027
to the psychiatric couch
for many, many years.


1514
01:21:51.152 --> 01:21:52.361
<i>Was it difficult?</i>

1515
01:21:52.486 --> 01:21:54.780
Uh... not...

1516
01:21:54.905 --> 01:21:57.074
not at all, not at all.

1517
01:21:57.199 --> 01:21:59.326
It created no...
no problem at all.


1518
01:21:59.451 --> 01:22:00.994
- No...! feeling of guilt?
- No...!.


1519
01:22:01.119 --> 01:22:04.539
Well, actually, in a funny way,
it's just like in markets,


1520
01:22:04.664 --> 01:22:07.834
that if I weren't there--

1521
01:22:07.959 --> 01:22:10.127
<i>of course, I wasn't doing it--</i>

1522
01:22:10.252 --> 01:22:12.338
but somebody else
would-would...


1523
01:22:12.463 --> 01:22:13.881
would be taking it away anyhow.

1524
01:22:14.006 --> 01:22:16.216
And it was the...
whether I was there or not.


1525
01:22:16.341 --> 01:22:17.843
I was only a spectator.

1526
01:22:17.968 --> 01:22:19.594
The property
was being taken away.


1527
01:22:19.719 --> 01:22:24.182
So I had no role
in taking away that property.


1528
01:22:24.307 --> 01:22:26.184
So I had no sense of guilt.

1529
01:22:26.309 --> 01:22:27.810
Are you religious?

1530
01:22:27.935 --> 01:22:29.729
No...!.

1531
01:22:29.854 --> 01:22:32.523
- Do you believe in God?
- No.


1532
01:22:32.648 --> 01:22:36.527
The issue is not
what Soros did as a teenager.


1533
01:22:36.652 --> 01:22:38.737
It is that today, as an adult,

1534
01:22:38.862 --> 01:22:41.615
he sees nothing wrong
with What he did


1535
01:22:41.740 --> 01:22:45.451
and would seemingly be willing
to do it again.


1536
01:22:45.577 --> 01:22:50.289
Soros's self-justification
echoes an argument made by one


1537
01:22:50.414 --> 01:22:52.750
of the most notorious
Nazis himself.


1538
01:22:52.875 --> 01:22:54.752
"During my work
at the Gypsy camp,


1539
01:22:54.877 --> 01:22:56.837
"I came across Mengele
and watched his activities.


1540
01:22:56.962 --> 01:22:58.130
"I personally observed him

1541
01:22:58.255 --> 01:23:00.173
"infecting Gypsy twins
with typhus


1542
01:23:00.298 --> 01:23:02.258
"in order to observe
whether the twins


1543
01:23:02.384 --> 01:23:04.761
"reacted differently
or in the same way.


1544
01:23:04.886 --> 01:23:07.221
"Shortly after...
after they were in...


1545
01:23:07.346 --> 01:23:09.849
had been infected,
they were gassed."


1546
01:23:09.974 --> 01:23:13.102
Do you believe that your father
was responsible for this?


1547
01:23:13.227 --> 01:23:18.023
Personally,
he did not assume he did it.


1548
01:23:18.148 --> 01:23:20.025
He thought he is a member

1549
01:23:20.150 --> 01:23:24.195
of a concentration camp,
he's not responsible for it,


1550
01:23:24.320 --> 01:23:26.864
because he did not...

1551
01:23:26.989 --> 01:23:29.992
invent the concentration camp.

1552
01:23:33.662 --> 01:23:35.539
Enough big lies.

1553
01:23:35.664 --> 01:23:39.000
It is time to tell the truth.

1554
01:23:39.126 --> 01:23:43.046
The progressive Democrats
are the true racists.


1555
01:23:43.171 --> 01:23:45.798
They are the true fascists.

1556
01:23:47.341 --> 01:23:49.343
They want to steal our income,

1557
01:23:49.468 --> 01:23:52.513
they want to steal
our earnings and our wealth


1558
01:23:52.638 --> 01:23:55.682
and our freedom and our lives.

1559
01:23:55.808 --> 01:23:58.352
They're trying to kill America

1560
01:23:58.477 --> 01:24:01.062
by killing
the economic and political


1561
01:24:01.187 --> 01:24:03.314
and religious freedom
of Americans.


1562
01:24:03.440 --> 01:24:06.776
My wife Debbie grew up
in Venezuela


1563
01:24:06.901 --> 01:24:09.695
and has seen firsthand
a prosperous democratic country


1564
01:24:09.820 --> 01:24:13.741
give way to socialist tyranny.

1565
01:24:13.866 --> 01:24:15.284
There, a fascist regime

1566
01:24:15.409 --> 01:24:18.537
is destroying the lives
of the Venezuelan people.


1567
01:24:18.662 --> 01:24:22.874
<i>Debbie prays that America
doesn't go down this road.</i>


1568
01:27:05.565 --> 01:27:08.943
How do we fight
the tyranny of the left?


1569
01:27:10.653 --> 01:27:13.781
We, as citizens,
have to do our part,


1570
01:27:13.906 --> 01:27:16.909
as some did
even in Nazi Germany.


1571
01:27:17.993 --> 01:27:19.703
Like Lenin and Hitler,

1572
01:27:19.828 --> 01:27:23.415
Sophie Scholl came here
to Schwabing to study.


1573
01:27:23.540 --> 01:27:25.166
While attending university,

1574
01:27:25.291 --> 01:27:28.044
she learned of the atrocities
of the Nazis.


1575
01:27:28.169 --> 01:27:29.420
She saw them.

1576
01:27:30.504 --> 01:27:32.464
As a devout Christian,

1577
01:27:32.590 --> 01:27:34.550
she rejected
Nazi indoctrination


1578
01:27:34.675 --> 01:27:36.635
and joined the White Rose,

1579
01:27:36.760 --> 01:27:40.764
a group of activists
horrified by German war crimes.


1580
01:27:45.852 --> 01:27:47.603
She and her associates

1581
01:27:47.728 --> 01:27:50.272
distributed pamphlets
using Bible verses


1582
01:27:50.398 --> 01:27:53.067
and philosophical arguments
for resistance


1583
01:27:53.192 --> 01:27:55.861
to National Socialism.

1584
01:27:55.986 --> 01:27:57.904
She showed us
how one individual...


1585
01:27:58.030 --> 01:27:59.030
Thank you.

1586
01:27:59.156 --> 01:28:01.116
...can fight to save a nation.

1587
01:28:07.080 --> 01:28:08.289
Lights.

1588
01:28:24.220 --> 01:28:25.888
It's okay.

1589
01:28:33.896 --> 01:28:36.690
Therefore, every individual

1590
01:28:36.815 --> 01:28:39.818
conscious
of his responsibility


1591
01:28:39.943 --> 01:28:43.029
as a member of Christian
and Western civilization


1592
01:28:43.154 --> 01:28:45.698
must defend himself

1593
01:28:45.823 --> 01:28:49.076
as best he can
at this late hour.


1594
01:28:49.201 --> 01:28:51.495
He must work against fascism

1595
01:28:51.620 --> 01:28:55.207
and any similar system
of totalitarianism.


1596
01:29:55.554 --> 01:29:57.472
Quick.
Before the class is over.


1597
01:30:07.940 --> 01:30:09.900
Be safe.

1598
01:32:28.861 --> 01:32:32.656
"Every word that comes
from Hitler's mouth is a lie.


1599
01:32:35.617 --> 01:32:39.204
"When he says 'peace,'
he means 'war,'


1600
01:32:39.329 --> 01:32:42.832
"and when he blasphemously uses
the name of the Almighty,


1601
01:32:42.957 --> 01:32:44.709
"he means the power of evil,

1602
01:32:44.834 --> 01:32:46.961
"the fallen angel, Satan.

1603
01:32:52.841 --> 01:32:57.346
His mouth is
the foul-smelling maw of hell."


1604
01:33:06.229 --> 01:33:09.232
How dare you speak
against the Fuhrer!


1605
01:33:13.902 --> 01:33:16.238
Somebody, after all...

1606
01:33:16.363 --> 01:33:18.240
had to make a start.

1607
01:33:18.365 --> 01:33:21.201
What we wrote and said

1608
01:33:21.326 --> 01:33:24.913
-is also believed
by many others.


1609
01:33:26.497 --> 01:33:28.916
They just don't dare
to express themselves


1610
01:33:29.041 --> 01:33:30.668
as we did.

1611
01:33:33.128 --> 01:33:36.882
Found guilty, you will be
put to death for this treason.


1612
01:33:42.303 --> 01:33:44.639
Will it be Worth it?

1613
01:33:48.351 --> 01:33:50.853
An end in terror

1614
01:33:50.978 --> 01:33:54.106
is preferable
to a terror with no end.


1615
01:34:16.627 --> 01:34:19.337
I will cling to the rope

1616
01:34:19.463 --> 01:34:22.674
God has thrown to me
in Jesus Christ,


1617
01:34:22.799 --> 01:34:26.177
even when my numb hands

1618
01:34:26.302 --> 01:34:28.054
can no longer feel it.

1619
01:34:39.523 --> 01:34:41.983
Isn't it a riddle

1620
01:34:42.108 --> 01:34:44.360
and awe-inspiring

1621
01:34:44.485 --> 01:34:47.905
that everything
is so beautiful...


1622
01:34:48.030 --> 01:34:49.991
despite the horror?

1623
01:34:51.992 --> 01:34:56.163
Lately, I have noticed
something grand and mysterious


1624
01:34:56.288 --> 01:35:00.792
peering through my sheer joy
in all that is beautiful,


1625
01:35:00.917 --> 01:35:03.962
a sense of its creator.

1626
01:35:04.087 --> 01:35:07.006
Only man can truly be ugly,

1627
01:35:07.131 --> 01:35:09.467
because he has the free will

1628
01:35:09.592 --> 01:35:12.344
to estrange himself...

1629
01:35:12.469 --> 01:35:15.013
from this song of praise.

1630
01:35:23.646 --> 01:35:26.441
How can we expect fate

1631
01:35:26.566 --> 01:35:30.152
to let a righteous cause
prevail


1632
01:35:30.277 --> 01:35:32.404
when there is hardly anyone

1633
01:35:32.530 --> 01:35:36.491
who will give himself up
undividedly


1634
01:35:36.617 --> 01:35:38.869
to a righteous cause?

1635
01:35:44.916 --> 01:35:48.169
Stand up
for what you believe in.


1636
01:35:51.547 --> 01:35:54.967
Even if you are standing alone.

1637
01:36:22.117 --> 01:36:24.536
She showed us
how one individual


1638
01:36:24.661 --> 01:36:27.580
can fight to save a nation.

1639
01:36:31.208 --> 01:36:36.088
How do we, as a nation,
fight leftist tyranny?


1640
01:36:36.213 --> 01:36:37.756
Reagan knew how to fight.

1641
01:36:37.881 --> 01:36:41.468
Mr. Gorbachev, open this gate.

1642
01:36:41.593 --> 01:36:43.344
Mr. Gorbachev,

1643
01:36:43.470 --> 01:36:45.471
tear down this wall.

1644
01:36:47.265 --> 01:36:49.141
And Reagan knew how to win.

1645
01:36:49.267 --> 01:36:50.976
Fascism ever comes
to America, it'll come


1646
01:36:51.143 --> 01:36:52.561
in the name of-of liberalism.

1647
01:36:52.686 --> 01:36:55.397
And what is fascism?
Fascism is:


1648
01:36:55.522 --> 01:36:57.357
private ownership,
private enterprise,


1649
01:36:57.482 --> 01:36:59.860
but total government control
and regulation.


1650
01:36:59.985 --> 01:37:02.153
Well, isn't this
the liberal philosophy?


1651
01:37:02.278 --> 01:37:03.571
The conservative, so-called,

1652
01:37:03.696 --> 01:37:05.615
is the one that says,
"Less government,


1653
01:37:05.740 --> 01:37:08.242
"get off my back,
get out of my pocket,


1654
01:37:08.367 --> 01:37:11.912
and let me have more control
of my own destiny."


1655
01:37:12.037 --> 01:37:15.874
Trump is the inheritor
of the Reagan mantle.


1656
01:37:15.999 --> 01:37:18.919
Do we have the desire
and the courage


1657
01:37:19.044 --> 01:37:21.004
to preserve our civilization

1658
01:37:21.129 --> 01:37:25.925
in the face of those who
would subvert and destroy it?


1659
01:37:26.050 --> 01:37:28.052
The parties
haven't switched sides.


1660
01:37:28.177 --> 01:37:32.515
The main issue separating them
is the same as in 1860.


1661
01:37:32.640 --> 01:37:35.309
You toil and work
and earn bread,


1662
01:37:35.434 --> 01:37:37.311
and I'll eat it.

1663
01:37:37.436 --> 01:37:39.729
Lincoln exposed
the Democratic Party


1664
01:37:39.855 --> 01:37:41.731
as the party of theft.

1665
01:37:41.856 --> 01:37:45.193
Republicans, he said, stand
for the right of Americans


1666
01:37:45.318 --> 01:37:47.737
to keep the fruits
of their labor.


1667
01:37:47.862 --> 01:37:49.989
Well, that's what
Republicans stand for now.


1668
01:37:50.114 --> 01:37:52.241
That's what Trump
is fighting for.


1669
01:37:52.366 --> 01:37:56.662
Democrats have gone from
one theft scheme to another.


1670
01:37:56.787 --> 01:37:59.539
You work,
and they take what you earn


1671
01:37:59.664 --> 01:38:01.583
to keep themselves in power.

1672
01:38:01.708 --> 01:38:05.837
<i>Democrats were the party
of tyranny and enslavement</i>


1673
01:38:05.962 --> 01:38:07.547
in Lincoln 's time,

1674
01:38:07.672 --> 01:38:11.383
<i>and they are the party
of tyranny and enslavement now.</i>


1675
01:38:12.927 --> 01:38:15.137
If Lee had been victorious

1676
01:38:15.262 --> 01:38:17.764
at Gettysburg,
that would have brought down


1677
01:38:17.889 --> 01:38:19.558
the entire administration.

1678
01:38:19.683 --> 01:38:21.601
And what the future
beyond that would have been


1679
01:38:21.726 --> 01:38:25.521
is almost unthinkable,
because then,


1680
01:38:25.647 --> 01:38:27.231
where would there have been

1681
01:38:27.356 --> 01:38:29.525
an American republic
to intervene


1682
01:38:29.650 --> 01:38:32.528
against German militarism
in World War I


1683
01:38:32.653 --> 01:38:35.364
or, worse still,
the universal midnight


1684
01:38:35.489 --> 01:38:37.366
of Nazism in World War ll?

1685
01:38:37.491 --> 01:38:39.159
The consequences of Gettysburg,

1686
01:38:39.284 --> 01:38:41.119
if they'd gone
in the other direction,


1687
01:38:41.244 --> 01:38:42.954
are simply enough

1688
01:38:43.079 --> 01:38:45.164
to make the flesh creep.

1689
01:38:45.290 --> 01:38:47.166
Lincoln was tough.

1690
01:38:47.291 --> 01:38:49.752
He refused to give up
his electoral mandate.


1691
01:38:49.877 --> 01:38:53.047
He insisted it belonged
to the American people.


1692
01:38:53.172 --> 01:38:56.383
He united Republicans
behind that toughness.


1693
01:38:56.508 --> 01:38:58.802
Trump has
Lincoln 's inner toughness,


1694
01:38:58.927 --> 01:39:01.137
but he needs
the Republican Party


1695
01:39:01.263 --> 01:39:03.056
to get behind him.

1696
01:39:03.181 --> 01:39:04.891
Lincoln was the architect

1697
01:39:05.016 --> 01:39:07.894
of a decent
American nationalism.


1698
01:39:08.019 --> 01:39:11.188
Trump must follow
in Lincoln 's footsteps.


1699
01:39:11.313 --> 01:39:14.733
In this way,
Trump can complete the task


1700
01:39:14.858 --> 01:39:17.361
to which Lincoln
dedicated his life:


1701
01:39:17.486 --> 01:39:19.654
shutting down,
once and for all,


1702
01:39:19.780 --> 01:39:22.365
the Democratic plantation.

1703
01:39:22.490 --> 01:39:26.244
A nation dies
when its people are not free.


1704
01:39:26.369 --> 01:39:28.704
<i>It's our America.</i>

1705
01:39:28.829 --> 01:39:31.582
Let's save it
for the second time.


1706
01:39:31.707 --> 01:39:33.500
It is rather for us

1707
01:39:33.626 --> 01:39:37.296
to be here dedicated
to the great task before us--


1708
01:39:37.421 --> 01:39:39.423
that from these honored dead

1709
01:39:39.548 --> 01:39:44.135
we take increased devotion to
the cause for which they gave


1710
01:39:44.260 --> 01:39:48.097
the last full measure
of devotion,


1711
01:39:48.222 --> 01:39:52.059
that we here highly resolve
that these dead


1712
01:39:52.184 --> 01:39:55.020
shall not have died in vain,

1713
01:39:55.145 --> 01:39:56.021
that this nation,

1714
01:39:56.146 --> 01:39:58.106
under God,

1715
01:39:58.231 --> 01:40:01.276
shall have a new birth
of freedom,


1716
01:40:01.401 --> 01:40:04.195
and that government
of the people,


1717
01:40:04.320 --> 01:40:06.364
by the people

1718
01:40:06.489 --> 01:40:08.991
and for the people,

1719
01:40:09.116 --> 01:40:12.661
shall not perish
from the Earth.


1720
01:42:31.205 --> 01:42:34.083
Sing it, children.
