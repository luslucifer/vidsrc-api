1
00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:49.559
The War was over...

2
00:01:49.836 --> 00:01:51.927
The only survivors were street animals:

3
00:01:51.936 --> 00:01:55.097
dogs, cats and rats.

4
00:01:55.105 --> 00:01:59.692
From them, a new race of mutants evolved.

5
00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.339
That was a long time ago.

6
00:02:03.912 --> 00:02:09.393
Mok, a legendary super rocker,
has retired to Ohmtown.


7
00:02:10.071 --> 00:02:13.397
There his computers work at
deciphering an ancient code


8
00:02:13.642 --> 00:02:17.536
which would unlock a doorway between
this world and another dimension


9
00:02:17.938 --> 00:02:21.264
Obsessed with his dark experiment,

10
00:02:21.535 --> 00:02:25.927
Mok himself searches or the
last crucial component...


11
00:02:27.827 --> 00:02:34.216
a very special voice.

12
00:02:57.913 --> 00:02:59.878
Whew, home at last!

13
00:03:00.314 --> 00:03:04.501
We've seen every new singer
in the whole country.


14
00:03:04.787 --> 00:03:07.631
Hey, did the boss find the
voice for his new act?


15
00:03:07.632 --> 00:03:10.365
Nah, and he ain't gonna, cause
there's no place left to look.


16
00:03:10.376 --> 00:03:11.276
Toad?

17
00:03:11.277 --> 00:03:12.274
Yeah?

18
00:03:12.275 --> 00:03:15.269
One more show, in town.

19
00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:16.586
But boss...

20
00:03:16.587 --> 00:03:18.264
Now!

21
00:03:18.265 --> 00:03:20.347
I'll get the car.

22
00:03:38.978 --> 00:03:40.570
Computer, report.

23
00:03:40.626 --> 00:03:42.722
Your record sales are dropping.

24
00:03:42.723 --> 00:03:48.213
A confidential analysis shows a
downward trend in popularity...


25
00:03:48.214 --> 00:03:49.192
Enough!

26
00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.211
that could result....

27
00:03:49.212 --> 00:03:50.908
Stop!

28
00:03:50.923 --> 00:03:53.409
Not you stupid, drive on.

29
00:04:06.369 --> 00:04:07.834
Downward trend in popularity. Hmph.

30
00:04:09.683 --> 00:04:12.307
Computer, report on our ...project.

31
00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:15.739
Progress on this project unchanged.

32
00:04:16.911 --> 00:04:19.897
Show me the Armageddon Key.

33
00:04:32.453 --> 00:04:33.934
Have you finished decoding it?

34
00:04:33.954 --> 00:04:36.043
Decoding not yet complete Mok.

35
00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:37.128
I see.

36
00:04:40.216 --> 00:04:44.698
Most recent calculations show
you will still need a living voice


37
00:04:44.815 --> 00:04:49.604
The vibrations from this voice
will create the doorway


38
00:04:49.607 --> 00:04:51.955
through which the being
will enter this dimension.


39
00:04:55.328 --> 00:04:59.590
The ring I designed will identify the exact
voice frequency you will require.


40
00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:02.513
Yes yes, thank you.

41
00:05:02.655 --> 00:05:04.088
You're welcome Mok.

42
00:05:07.251 --> 00:05:13.605
That one voice will bring me a powerful
being from another dimension.


43
00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:20.437
A scientific breakthrough for me;

44
00:05:21.146 --> 00:05:26.867
an unforgettable magic show for the masses.

45
00:05:39.951 --> 00:05:41.680
You really have a way with words Omar.

46
00:05:43.018 --> 00:05:44.453
Hey, I'm rehearsing.

47
00:05:46.123 --> 00:05:49.482
So we play one song.
One of your songs, of course.


48
00:05:49.604 --> 00:05:50.403
Of course.

49
00:05:50.902 --> 00:05:56.689
So if we did two
songs, one could be mine.

50
00:06:00.854 --> 00:06:02.981
...yeah ...yeah, okay.

51
00:06:02.982 --> 00:06:03.979
Omar!

52
00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:05.377
yeah Angel?

53
00:06:05.477 --> 00:06:09.475
- I'm gonna trust you.
- Yeah, you trust everybody.


54
00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:15.458
Where's Dizzy and Stretch?
You cannot defend your planet alone.
Prepare to die Space Cadet.


55
00:06:18.528 --> 00:06:19.952
C'mon Stretch, 
We're on in five.

56
00:06:19.953 --> 00:06:21.449
No, nyet! Not yet Diz.

57
00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:23.919
I gotta unwind! Look out!

58
00:06:24.194 --> 00:06:26.940
You've got company at twelve o'clock.

59
00:06:26.941 --> 00:06:28.891
But the house is such a mess!

60
00:06:29.435 --> 00:06:30.004
Stretch...

61
00:06:30.134 --> 00:06:31.931
Go away, Fatso.

62
00:06:33.928 --> 00:06:43.928
I'm a goner! Oh no, magnetic forces
slowing down my brain... Help me...


63
00:06:45.109 --> 00:06:47.904
No replay.

64
00:06:47.905 --> 00:06:49.998
C'mon superstars, we've
got a song to get off.


65
00:06:50.399 --> 00:06:51.398
Two songs.

66
00:06:51.971 --> 00:06:52.895
yeah yeah yeah.

67
00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:57.461
C'mon Stretch, snap out of it.

68
00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:59.438
Okay, but I'm still not relaxed.

69
00:06:59.607 --> 00:07:02.592
You'll be okay, you're just nervous.
Take a deep breath.


70
00:07:05.873 --> 00:07:09.648
Hey, it worked! 
I'm not nervous, I'm scared.

71
00:07:10.864 --> 00:07:16.715
Fabuloso! Thanks guys, I too love
the sound of cats in boiling water.


72
00:07:17.453 --> 00:07:23.842

What happened?

95
00:08:46.201 --> 00:08:47.200
We didn't even finish!

96
00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:50.540
Give me just one good reason
why you guys should finish.


97
00:08:51.491 --> 00:08:52.510
How about this?

Welcome to Mylar's!


107
00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:13.344
The launching pad of the stars!

108
00:10:15.507 --> 00:10:19.200

So uh, what's going down,

111
00:10:30.521 --> 00:10:36.678
I mean this wouldn't have anything to do with
your world-wide talent search, would it?


112
00:10:38.322 --> 00:10:40.016
Okay okay, so it's hush hush,

113
00:10:40.105 --> 00:10:48.637
I don't know anything, except... I might just
have a band... that could make us both a bundle.


114
00:10:50.344 --> 00:10:53.502
...a tidy sum?
...a couple of bucks?


115
00:10:57.003 --> 00:11:00.464
Heeey! I didn't say it
was THIS band, did I?


116
00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:10.158
Now I have revealed exactly why I'm here,
I'll be your angel if you want to see


117
00:11:10.165 --> 00:11:13.554
how perfect sharing love
with an angel can be.


118
00:11:32.933 --> 00:11:38.414
Like I said, this band's on
it's way to fame and fortune.


119
00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:39.902
All right!

120
00:11:50.475 --> 00:11:55.832
I loved it! And so did a warm
personal and influential friend of mine.


121
00:11:55.874 --> 00:12:01.365
The only Ohmtown rocker to have a record go gold,
platinum and plutonium in one day!


122
00:12:01.366 --> 00:12:04.513
Um... Don't tell me... um, um, who?

123
00:12:04.559 --> 00:12:06.518
Mok, the Magic Man!

124
00:12:06.556 --> 00:12:10.350
Mok? Don't let him get us!
He'll put a heck on me!


125
00:12:10.449 --> 00:12:12.312
Hex, Stretch, hex.

126
00:12:12.745 --> 00:12:15.341
Ooh, two of them, that's even worse!

127
00:12:15.541 --> 00:12:19.839
Hey guys, I'm gonna work up your promo,
so which one's your lead singer?


128
00:12:19.933 --> 00:12:20.853
- Omar.
- Angel.


129
00:12:22.023 --> 00:12:22.887
- Angel.
- Omar.


130
00:12:22.928 --> 00:12:32.928
A duo? Fabuloso! Old fashioned but new!
I love it!


131
00:12:44.291 --> 00:12:44.890
Where'd Angel go?

132
00:12:45.289 --> 00:12:51.308
I dunno. She left. So, uh, listen Omar,
have you ever thought about, well,


133
00:12:51.978 --> 00:12:52.910
about singing with Angel?

134
00:12:53.384 --> 00:12:57.208
Yeah Omar. You know, two
lungs are better than one, right?


135
00:12:59.381 --> 00:13:04.035
You see Omar, Mr. Mylar was a little
confused about who our lead singer is...


136
00:13:04.177 --> 00:13:04.556
Yeah, and Dizzy...

137
00:13:04.615 --> 00:13:09.142
Okay, okay, I'm getting the idea.
I may be stubborn but I'm not stupid.


138
00:13:23.422 --> 00:13:30.072
Come on, Omar, I think if you and Angel ever got
together, someday we could be as big as Mok.


139
00:13:30.245 --> 00:13:30.711
Screw Mok.

140
00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:37.864
Omar, don't talk like that! Mok is everywhere!
M-M-Mok knows everything.


141
00:13:39.969 --> 00:13:43.295
It's Mok!

142
00:13:47.375 --> 00:13:50.996
No, it's not, it's
only officer Quadhole. Crazy cop.

143
00:13:52.391 --> 00:13:56.511
Hey you guys, you were
great tonight. See ya later.


144
00:14:12.659 --> 00:14:17.631
Look, why don't you leave me alone?
You've already screwed things up for one night.


145
00:14:17.632 --> 00:14:20.143
I trusted you, you jerk...

146
00:14:20.226 --> 00:14:22.456
Nice talk. I came to tell you.. 
You were good!

147
00:14:24.793 --> 00:14:25.919
You were good!

148
00:14:27.485 --> 00:14:28.848
So why'd you walk?

149
00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:39.670
Hey you know, everything got a little weird.

150
00:14:43.266 --> 00:14:46.254
Yeah, I know what you mean.

151
00:14:47.595 --> 00:14:54.421
I don't know Angel. 
I guess I just want it all, now.

152
00:14:55.192 --> 00:15:02.607
I want everything too, Omar.
It takes time.


153
00:15:55.662 --> 00:15:56.361
Miss Angel?

154
00:15:56.411 --> 00:15:59.591
Hey you sleazy pervo,
I'm gonna...


155
00:15:59.755 --> 00:16:01.752
A message for Miss Angel.

156
00:16:01.951 --> 00:16:03.449
Omar, forget him, look at this.

157
00:16:04.747 --> 00:16:08.752
Won't you come up for a spell?
Cute. Forget it.


158
00:16:10.061 --> 00:16:14.714
Come on! O, he wants to talk to us.
It could be big fun.


159
00:16:23.309 --> 00:16:25.139
I thought you weren't
coming up to Mok's, Omar.

160
00:16:25.311 --> 00:16:25.872
I changed my mind.

161
00:17:21.256 --> 00:17:23.688
Welcome to the modest house of Mok!

162
00:17:23.811 --> 00:17:25.625
Omar, you haven't even met the guy.

163
00:17:25.997 --> 00:17:28.722
Don't have to, 
I've seen his magic act.

164
00:17:31.857 --> 00:17:33.346
If I didn't know you better,
Omar, I'd say you were jealous.


165
00:17:33.594 --> 00:17:35.702
Get serious.

166
00:17:36.914 --> 00:17:38.142
I guess you're not coming in?

167
00:17:38.286 --> 00:17:39.712
I guess you're right.

168
00:17:39.783 --> 00:17:40.782
Shoot yourself.

169
00:17:43.387 --> 00:17:45.215
How do you get in?

170
00:17:45.274 --> 00:17:48.348
M-m-m-maybe you gotta sacrifice
a goat or something. Ooh!

171
00:17:52.957 --> 00:17:54.258
Yeah?

172
00:17:55.258 --> 00:17:57.752
W-we're here t-to see Mok...

173
00:17:57.852 --> 00:17:59.791
Mok! Great to see ya!

174
00:17:59.849 --> 00:18:00.365
he heh, but eh

175
00:18:00.568 --> 00:18:03.742
Nice place you got here.
Kinda cozy.


176
00:18:04.108 --> 00:18:04.305
Ah thanks uh, but...

177
00:18:04.445 --> 00:18:07.735
Mok, baby, let's talk some vinyl,
what's the deal?


178
00:18:07.835 --> 00:18:11.506
Eh, listen, you got it all wrong,
I'm not... oof!


179
00:18:11.612 --> 00:18:15.938
Oh, hi! You must be Mok's brother.

180
00:18:16.077 --> 00:18:17.476
No, but... uh

181
00:18:17.745 --> 00:18:19.543
No? But you look so much alike.

182
00:18:20.046 --> 00:18:23.037
Duh, well uh we are brothers, but uh

183
00:18:23.109 --> 00:18:25.441
Like I said, let's bottom line it, Mok!

184
00:18:25.613 --> 00:18:27.170
I'M NOT MOK !!!

185
00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:29.875
You're not?

186
00:18:29.897 --> 00:18:30.514
No.

187
00:18:30.559 --> 00:18:36.180
Sorry. Mok! Great to see ya!

188
00:18:36.555 --> 00:18:37.487
Did you tell him I was Mok?

189
00:18:37.784 --> 00:18:38.321
No.

190
00:18:39.128 --> 00:18:41.752
Then why does he keep calling me Mok?

191
00:18:41.926 --> 00:18:44.016
Are you calling me a liar?

192
00:18:44.425 --> 00:18:47.018
No, but he keeps calling me Mok.

193
00:18:47.068 --> 00:18:49.225
- You are calling me a liar.
- I am... not.


194
00:18:50.095 --> 00:18:51.324
......

195
00:18:51.497 --> 00:18:55.055
That's it, party's over.
Let's blow.


196
00:18:55.664 --> 00:18:58.448
Slow down Omar, now let's give it a chance,
we might...


197
00:18:58.727 --> 00:19:02.021
Come on, it's a waste of
time to creep around this depravo's

198
00:19:02.042 --> 00:19:05.885
...mansion escorted by two
of mother nature's finest freaks.

199
00:19:06.622 --> 00:19:09.949
-Three... -Huh?
Three!


200
00:19:10.222 --> 00:19:11.986
This one talks in numbers.

201
00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:19.577
Words to the wise, guy. Be nice, or be dog food.
Follow?


202
00:19:27.598 --> 00:19:29.338
Make yourselves at home.

203
00:19:29.908 --> 00:19:30.967
Except you.

204
00:19:32.347 --> 00:19:34.334
It was the freak reference, wasn't it?

205
00:19:35.012 --> 00:19:37.209
You gonna apologize, rude boy?

206
00:19:38.122 --> 00:19:42.676
- I'm sorry... dog-breath!
- What you..?!


207
00:19:59.701 --> 00:20:00.497
Anyone want a beer?

208
00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:04.768
I'm Mok.

209
00:20:04.908 --> 00:20:06.430
Hi.

210
00:20:06.531 --> 00:20:09.708
- Am Not!
- Am so!


211
00:20:10.079 --> 00:20:11.945
Ahem!

212
00:20:12.465 --> 00:20:18.615
Allow me to introduce the
Rollerskating Schlepper Brothers:


213
00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:21.649
Toad, Sleazy and Zip.

214
00:20:22.364 --> 00:20:24.454
Mes assistants stupide.

215
00:20:24.997 --> 00:20:26.395
I just love it
when he talks French... ooof!

216
00:20:28.063 --> 00:20:37.483
Ah, sweet Angel. 
You look more beautiful in person, than you do onstage.

217
00:20:38.316 --> 00:20:41.143
Better get some antiseptic
on that before it festers.


218
00:20:45.434 --> 00:20:49.090
Well, uh, that's Omar, our lead singer and...
And this...


219
00:20:49.258 --> 00:20:52.761
Enough about them, let's talk about you.

220
00:20:52.852 --> 00:20:55.151
What did you think of my last album?

221
00:20:55.749 --> 00:20:57.841
I loved it!

222
00:20:57.843 --> 00:21:02.144
I bought it too. 
My gerbil uses it for a room divider.

223
00:21:13.295 --> 00:21:16.950
But where's our hospitality? Boys!
Bring on the Edison Balls.


224
00:21:19.123 --> 00:21:26.103
I'm sure you're into reaching new
levels of consciousness, aren't you?


225
00:21:26.108 --> 00:21:30.347
Yeah, we're into that kinda stuff. 
It's all we ever do.

226
00:21:30.672 --> 00:21:36.754
Excellent. Then I've got something
you boys will really enjoy.

227
00:21:38.696 --> 00:21:42.060
Shall we take a stroll
in the garden, my dear?

228
00:21:42.262 --> 00:21:44.247
Here, wiseguy.

229
00:21:59.667 --> 00:22:01.833
Ooh. Uh, not for me, 
I've had one today, and uh...

230
00:22:01.834 --> 00:22:02.363
Catch!

231
00:22:08.524 --> 00:22:10.386
Where's the fat one?

232
00:22:12.488 --> 00:22:21.734
Fat one? Hmph. I don't like this.
Angel? ...Angel?


233
00:22:30.659 --> 00:22:32.784
So, uh, how many
rooms you crammed into here?

234
00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:39.115
Success does have it's rewards, Angel.

235
00:22:40.355 --> 00:22:47.674
However, such trophies are minor
compared to what I really want.


236
00:22:48.044 --> 00:22:52.098
Okay on number three;
fade up on the girl.


237
00:22:52.254 --> 00:22:55.806
An audience which and
understand the power of magic.

238
00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:58.135
My magic.

239
00:22:58.136 --> 00:23:00.930
Is that too much to ask?

240
00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:04.681
No, but...

241
00:23:04.958 --> 00:23:11.280
Apparently, it is. You must remember that my last concert
was not entirely sold out.


242
00:23:11.451 --> 00:23:13.179
So? It was still great. I was there!

243
00:23:13.652 --> 00:23:23.652
Don't toy with me, Angel. I'll show them power.
I can do it! With you, Angel, and your voice.


244
00:23:27.536 --> 00:23:28.833
What about the rest of the band?

245
00:23:28.883 --> 00:23:33.861
My contract has room
for only one signature: yours.

246
00:23:33.875 --> 00:23:38.492
The group's just starting to come together.
I think we've got a pretty good chance of...


247
00:23:38.567 --> 00:23:43.193
Vegetating on the Ohmtown circuit
for the rest of your life.

248
00:23:45.559 --> 00:23:47.921
Call it what you want! 
I believe in...

249
00:23:47.951 --> 00:23:52.876
Miracles? If you think you're going
anywhere with the Omars of this world...


250
00:23:54.953 --> 00:23:59.007
Open your eyes! 
Accept my offer.

251
00:23:59.032 --> 00:24:03.244
No Mok. I couldn't leave them for anything.

252
00:24:03.424 --> 00:24:11.964
I didn't offer you
anything; I offer you EVERYTHING!

253
00:24:12.009 --> 00:24:13.004
NO!

254
00:24:13.576 --> 00:24:20.498
Too bad. But we all have our illusions,
far be it for me to take away yours.


255
00:24:22.996 --> 00:24:24.987
Hey, she's picking it up.

256
00:24:25.087 --> 00:24:27.363
Yeah, the boss was right.

257
00:24:27.383 --> 00:24:31.024
Come on, Come on, the boss it waiting!

258
00:24:31.076 --> 00:24:32.263
Toad.

259
00:24:40.064 --> 00:24:46.064
You will bring me my demon,
whether you like it or not.


260
00:24:48.364 --> 00:24:52.239
Show her friends to the door.

261
00:24:52.839 --> 00:25:00.055
Angel? Angel? We have to go. Oh no.

262
00:25:01.898 --> 00:25:05.855
I spy with my little
eye something that begins with...

263
00:25:05.918 --> 00:25:07.529
...Fat!

264
00:25:07.616 --> 00:25:11.186
I was looking for you. What's going on?
I demand an answer!


265
00:25:11.209 --> 00:25:14.189
Hey you know, you're a pretty nosy guy.

266
00:25:14.204 --> 00:25:20.985
Violence is not the answer to anything.
Can't we discuss this civilized human beings?


267
00:25:21.029 --> 00:25:23.460
Nope, I don't think so.

268
00:25:24.227 --> 00:25:30.982
Look Sleazy. These ones are still watching old
holograms I think their brains have seized up!


269
00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:40.020
♪ Triumph! Triumph to the glory!
♪ Triumph of the glory of me!


270
00:26:16.545 --> 00:26:20.636
Aww, look-it Toad, now
they're sleeping like little babies.

271
00:26:20.790 --> 00:26:24.433
Everyone outta the pool!

272
00:26:24.508 --> 00:26:26.979
But Toad, they can't walk in this condition.

273
00:26:27.079 --> 00:26:32.606
Yeah, you're right Sleazy.
I think they better drive.


274
00:27:20.992 --> 00:27:26.918
Excuse me, but could you
put me down? Hello? Hello?

275
00:27:26.987 --> 00:27:29.712
Is anyone in there? Ouch!

276
00:27:29.572 --> 00:27:35.512
Oh, so you wanna play rough eh?
That's what I was afraid of.


277
00:27:35.561 --> 00:27:37.653
These hands are lethal weapons.
I could paralyze you.


278
00:27:37.658 --> 00:27:41.938
Oh no you couldn't. Remember, violence is
not the answer to anything.


279
00:27:41.950 --> 00:27:46.204
Hey Toad, this one's got lethal weapons.

280
00:27:46.243 --> 00:27:50.772
Whoa! Keep him away from me!

281
00:27:53.830 --> 00:28:00.818
You skinheads don't scare me!
Omar! Stretch! Where's Angel?


282
00:28:00.819 --> 00:28:02.615
What have you done with her?

283
00:28:02.715 --> 00:28:06.981
We didn't do nuthin'.
She's goin to Nuke-York with Mok.


284
00:28:09.303 --> 00:28:11.140
She what?

285
00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:14.009
She's gonna be a big star.
Mok's gonna make her a big star!


286
00:28:14.649 --> 00:28:19.670
She was, uh, overwhelmed.

287
00:28:21.861 --> 00:28:25.254
Over, ...uh ...like he said.

288
00:28:25.294 --> 00:28:28.982
Wait a minute, she wouldn't
go anywhere with you guys.

289
00:28:30.767 --> 00:28:33.584
I'm bored Zip.

290
00:28:33.662 --> 00:28:35.824
Yah yah yah, me too.

291
00:28:36.757 --> 00:28:45.972
- Happy trails, buckaroos!
- Hey! You guys can't get away with...this?


292
00:29:04.749 --> 00:29:06.940
You guys are totally stoned!

293
00:29:07.879 --> 00:29:11.500
Stretch, Stretch, wake up! I can't
drive this car!


294
00:29:11.597 --> 00:29:16.760
Alright, where are the keys!?
Where are the keys!?


295
00:29:17.575 --> 00:29:19.134
Dumb dog!

296
00:29:19.163 --> 00:29:22.338
Look... Look out!

297
00:29:28.468 --> 00:29:33.158
Get a grip on yourself Dizzy.
We're not going to die.


298
00:29:35.127 --> 00:29:37.785
Oh yes we are!

299
00:29:42.519 --> 00:29:47.307
Oh no, the bag lady!

300
00:30:04.897 --> 00:30:07.905
Here, I'm sorry.

301
00:30:08.694 --> 00:30:16.731
Oh no! This is my
car, my wheels, my Voltage Wagon!

302
00:30:17.336 --> 00:30:18.873
Hey, Stretch, dehydrate.

303
00:30:18.874 --> 00:30:19.871
Okay.

304
00:30:24.962 --> 00:30:26.859
Ah! What's going on? 
Where's Angel?

305
00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:29.055
Angel's gone, Omar.

306
00:30:29.056 --> 00:30:29.956
What?

307
00:30:30.004 --> 00:30:33.826
Look! There! Mok's taking her to Nuke
-York.

308
00:30:43.915 --> 00:30:48.023
Well, thank you, little Miss Ambition.

309
00:30:48.978 --> 00:30:53.637

310
00:30:53.713 --> 00:30:56.608
Owes you? Hmm!

311
00:30:56.610 --> 00:30:59.266
I mean US a personal explanation.

312
00:30:59.303 --> 00:31:01.999
Nuke York's only three days away.

313
00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:06.092
Gonna take us six days. 
We only got half a car left. Hee hee hee!

314
00:31:12.481 --> 00:31:14.477
Okay, you punks,

315
00:31:14.478 --> 00:31:15.975
Freeze.

316
00:31:15.976 --> 00:31:18.470
What are ya doin' in a public fountain?

317
00:31:18.471 --> 00:31:22.963
I give up Quad, what are
we doin' in a public fountain?

318
00:31:22.964 --> 00:31:24.959
Okay wiseguys, into the car. Now.

319
00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:26.231
Why?

320
00:31:26.457 --> 00:31:35.432
That's a 4-19, 
BF: Bathing Felony. 
You're luckily I'm not running you in for a 4-31: Improper Swimwear.

321
00:31:35.441 --> 00:31:40.932
Hey, wait! A real crime's been committed!
Those goons at Mok's place tried to push the car down the hill...


322
00:31:40.933 --> 00:31:42.870
Is this a confession?

323
00:31:42.928 --> 00:31:43.927
No.

324
00:31:43.928 --> 00:31:46.817
Then save it for the judge. Let's go.

325
00:31:46.822 --> 00:31:47.620
C'mon Dizzy.

326
00:31:47.621 --> 00:31:48.828
Huh?

327
00:31:48.838 --> 00:31:49.916
I'll get the evidence.

328
00:31:49.917 --> 00:31:51.713
Oh no... I'll get the evidence.

329
00:31:51.714 --> 00:31:55.819
Nah, I'll get the evidence.
No, you get the evidence.


330
00:31:55.906 --> 00:31:57.404
No, I'LL get it.

331
00:31:57.405 --> 00:31:58.402
Nah...

332
00:31:58.403 --> 00:32:03.793
I'll get it! You, get in the car. 
Trying to con a law officer...

333
00:32:03.794 --> 00:32:11.573
Well, let me tell you one thing, buddy; that's 6-37, and this time, 
I've got you red handed.

334
00:32:11.579 --> 00:32:13.776
Someday you're gonna thank me.

335
00:32:15.373 --> 00:32:17.613
You're absolutely right!
Thank You!!!


336
00:32:19.366 --> 00:32:21.741
You're welcome...

358
00:33:55.737 --> 00:33:57.311
Nuke York's not ready for us yet.

359
00:33:58.695 --> 00:34:02.701
Just remember Omar, it's not Ohmtown.
It's Nuke-York,


360
00:34:08.502 --> 00:34:11.193
Hold on to your privates, generals,
we're going through.


361
00:34:11.194 --> 00:34:12.696
Halt!

362
00:34:15.464 --> 00:34:23.680
Hey buddy, power black out. City's closed.
No admittance to unauthorized vehicular traffic.


363
00:34:24.092 --> 00:34:29.913
Chief Inspector Quaalude, Ohmtown Police,
these are scientists, big shots.


364
00:34:29.914 --> 00:34:33.435
Sorry Inspector, there's trouble inside
and it's my job to...


365
00:34:33.436 --> 00:34:36.369
That's great. You're doing a good job.
We'll be on our way.


366
00:34:36.370 --> 00:34:39.538
Thank's anyways, 
Inspector I'll just check this...

367
00:34:41.175 --> 00:34:45.015
Hey, this is a tuna fishing license!

368
00:35:46.637 --> 00:35:48.898
Just how long does Mok
think he can keep me here?

369
00:35:48.906 --> 00:35:51.002
Picnic time for little girls...

370
00:35:51.003 --> 00:35:54.028
This is what I think of your picnic.

371
00:35:54.037 --> 00:35:59.121
Ooh! Okay, that's it, you're gonna
stay here for a long time!


372
00:35:59.388 --> 00:36:01.395
Keep your flippers off me!

373
00:36:01.484 --> 00:36:03.281
Yeah, yeah, maybe even longer!

374
00:36:07.875 --> 00:36:09.971
Stuff it, pinheads!

375
00:36:09.972 --> 00:36:12.288
You got it, sister!

376
00:36:12.289 --> 00:36:16.747
Cinderella knows what you're talking about!

377
00:36:23.813 --> 00:36:28.001
Sometimes those brothers of mine
really burn my buns too.


378
00:36:28.002 --> 00:36:31.603
They keep this place locked up
tighter than a hummingbird's tweet.


379
00:36:32.832 --> 00:36:37.258
By the way doll, who're you?
Mok's new lady-friend?


380
00:36:37.324 --> 00:36:39.095
Mok's new lady-friend?

381
00:36:41.133 --> 00:36:47.307
Yeah, I guess so but, uh,
hey, it don't make life any easier.

382
00:36:47.308 --> 00:36:53.645
Cinderella knows what you're talking about.
They just don't understand us new women.


383
00:36:53.696 --> 00:36:56.890
all, every now and then a girl's
gotta get out and dance,


384
00:36:56.891 --> 00:36:58.288
catch my drift?

385
00:36:58.289 --> 00:37:04.209
Gotcha, doll. Hey, if you're talking about walking,
what's the scoop?


386
00:37:04.210 --> 00:37:08.271
No sweat! I just slide down the
chute and away I scoot!


387
00:37:08.272 --> 00:37:12.229
I do it every Saturday night!
Let's go!


388
00:37:18.753 --> 00:37:23.384
I have to be back in bed by twelve o'clock.
That's when Toad checks in on me.


389
00:37:23.385 --> 00:37:25.892
Aw, that's too bad toots, but never mind.

390
00:37:25.893 --> 00:37:34.279
With your funk and my spunk, we don't need
much time to find some real hot action!


391
00:37:34.285 --> 00:37:38.936
Hey, you're a little dated for one of Mok's,
you know what I mean?


392
00:37:38.938 --> 00:37:45.561
But that's okay. Just keep your lips
zipped and stick with Cindy.


393
00:37:45.562 --> 00:37:48.439
We're on our way to the Twilight Zone!

394
00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:58.440
Y'know, it's just like Toad says: 'There's wackos out there just waiting
for a for sweet young things like you.' So let's go for it!


395
00:38:06.770 --> 00:38:11.101
I've found the voice. 
I've got the girl.

396
00:38:11.163 --> 00:38:18.151
Understood. The Armageddon Key
has now been fully decoded.


397
00:38:18.152 --> 00:38:23.941
Stand by for data transmission.
According to the Key...


398
00:38:23.942 --> 00:38:30.215
... the girl must sing
this progression of musical notes.

399
00:38:31.628 --> 00:38:39.913
The vibrations of her voice will create a doorway
through which this being will enter this dimension.


400
00:38:40.013 --> 00:38:48.822
Ah yes. My beast; their nightmare.
All mine, for a song!


401
00:38:49.397 --> 00:38:53.753
And then, nothing can stop me!

402
00:38:53.789 --> 00:38:57.583
Tough shape, Mok. 
You can be stopped.

403
00:38:57.584 --> 00:39:02.574
There is a force which
can send the being back.

404
00:39:02.575 --> 00:39:07.067
Send it back? What? Where? Who?

405
00:39:07.068 --> 00:39:15.809
The being can be sent back by the
magic of one voice, one heart, one song.

406
00:39:15.810 --> 00:39:21.542
Magic? Magic, schmagic!
"One voice, one heart, one song,"


407
00:39:21.543 --> 00:39:26.074
Gibberish, garbage! 
Who is this person?

408
00:39:26.075 --> 00:39:33.763
Individual's identity presently unavailable.
Search will start now.


409
00:39:33.764 --> 00:39:38.132
Now checking, now checking, now checking...

410
00:39:40.509 --> 00:39:43.166
Grrr. Who can stop me? 
Is it the girl?

411
00:39:43.504 --> 00:39:45.001
You bumming out on me?

412
00:39:45.002 --> 00:39:46.998
No way.

413
00:39:47.023 --> 00:39:50.991
Okay then, let's get out
of here before we get caught.

414
00:39:50.992 --> 00:39:53.987
According to the Key, the being
can be sent back by the magic...


415
00:39:53.988 --> 00:39:59.081
I know, I know, "one voice one heart one song",
but WHO is it?


416
00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:05.472
No one. No one can send it back.

417
00:40:05.473 --> 00:40:11.020
No one? No such person?

418
00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:14.620
Then the beast is mine!

419
00:40:14.949 --> 00:40:18.610
PROMOTION: Raising a real demon could
be real bad for your image.

420
00:40:18.621 --> 00:40:21.620
ACCOUNTING: Think of the possible damage to sales
from famine, pestilence and et cetera.


421
00:40:21.625 --> 00:40:24.790
LEGAL: ...cost would be enormous.

422
00:40:24.798 --> 00:40:30.423
We all realize business is a tiny bit off but.
I mean this is pretty crazy...


423
00:40:30.424 --> 00:40:35.986
Wars have been started for less!
When I want your opinions. I'll give them to you.


424
00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:44.840
Whoooa... oof! We're in the clear.
Come on doll, let's score a cab!


425
00:40:44.841 --> 00:40:47.872
Right behind ya... heh.

426
00:40:58.378 --> 00:41:03.367
<i>You heard it here first:
Mok the Magic Man has announced he's coming out of seclusion</i>


427
00:41:03.368 --> 00:41:06.858
<i>to do a surprise concert
in Carnegie Hall!</i>


428
00:41:07.059 --> 00:41:11.480
<i>Tickets on sale at noon
for his triumphant "Beauty and the Beast" concert</i>


429
00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:13.331
<i>The show to end all shows!</i>

430
00:41:24.331 --> 00:41:26.897
AHH! OOH! EAAH!!
...Oh, I can't look!


431
00:41:28.823 --> 00:41:31.592
Oh yeah, the ladies will love this.
Okay, Alphonse.


432
00:41:31.618 --> 00:41:35.557
Alphonse? Ooh! 
So that's you're real name.

433
00:41:35.611 --> 00:41:37.650
Dry up, Stretch.

434
00:41:37.708 --> 00:41:39.856
Ooh, touchy!

435
00:41:39.904 --> 00:41:41.891
Let's see if I got the whole story.

436
00:41:41.901 --> 00:41:45.390
Oscar here piles everyone into a stolen police car,
beats it up to Nuke-York,


437
00:41:45.395 --> 00:41:54.381
tries to run the barricades, you all get busted by the city cops,
and I have ta close down shop for half a day to bail you all out.


438
00:41:54.382 --> 00:41:57.773
It's not exactly as it sounds, Aunt Edith.
We're a band, right?


439
00:41:57.774 --> 00:42:01.609
And Angel left without
telling anybody, and we just...

440
00:42:01.610 --> 00:42:03.782
Oscar says she owes us a personal explanation.

441
00:42:03.863 --> 00:42:08.754
For what? Because she ran off
with Mok, without saying goodbye?


442
00:42:08.755 --> 00:42:12.975
Cause he's a big star
and you guys are just wishing?

443
00:42:12.987 --> 00:42:14.744
We're concerned.

444
00:42:15.017 --> 00:42:16.108
Say what?

445
00:42:16.142 --> 00:42:17.378
I said we're concerned.

446
00:42:17.379 --> 00:42:18.543
Concerned about who?

447
00:42:18.544 --> 00:42:20.282
About Angel, we're concerned about her, okay?!

448
00:42:20.334 --> 00:42:21.618
You're all heart, Oscar.

449
00:42:21.619 --> 00:42:23.429
You never told us we're concerned.

450
00:42:23.430 --> 00:42:26.391
Is it some sort of proof there?

451
00:42:26.424 --> 00:42:28.414
Oh yeah, if it gives
you any trouble, come on back.

452
00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:33.212
Okay guys, I can't tell you much about Mok,
but I can tell you about Cinderella.


453
00:42:33.213 --> 00:42:35.708
Aw, are you gonna tuck us in, too?

454
00:42:35.709 --> 00:42:40.868
Relax Oscar, I was just beginning
to like ya, ya little scumbag.


455
00:42:40.869 --> 00:42:45.401
Like I was saying, she's the little sister of
a couple of guys who work for Mok.


456
00:42:45.691 --> 00:42:48.304
Toad, Zeazy and Slip?

457
00:42:48.608 --> 00:42:50.006
Yeah, close.

458
00:42:50.109 --> 00:42:51.681
So where will we find her?

459
00:42:51.682 --> 00:42:53.467
I know she hangs around an uptown club.

460
00:42:53.478 --> 00:42:54.775
What does she look like?

461
00:42:54.776 --> 00:43:00.134
Sorry Alphonse, everyone looks the same through this thing.
But she's got a winged heart tattoo;


462
00:43:00.136 --> 00:43:03.766
my $14.95 special.

463
00:43:22.628 --> 00:43:23.627
Toad here.

464
00:43:23.628 --> 00:43:24.675
Captain.

465
00:43:24.676 --> 00:43:27.620
What do YOU want?

466
00:43:27.621 --> 00:43:30.615
You got to listen to my side of the story now. 
It was not my fault

467
00:43:30.616 --> 00:43:35.806
that night at all. Those cops were supposed
to be on the take. I am on the level!


468
00:43:35.807 --> 00:43:42.095
To prove it, I've got some scuttlebutt for you.
Now, you set your sails for this joint downtown:


469
00:43:42.096 --> 00:43:44.091
Club SixSixtySix.

470
00:43:44.092 --> 00:43:50.880
Now there are some three guys, from Ohmtown,
gonna drop anchor there with a cargo of trouble.


471
00:43:50.881 --> 00:43:54.224
They're looking for you little sister.
Now we're even, right?


472
00:43:56.359 --> 00:43:58.067
So get off my back?

473
00:43:58.267 --> 00:43:59.690
...oh shit!

474
00:44:03.855 --> 00:44:06.318
Now we're even fink.

475
00:44:06.353 --> 00:44:09.777
We're going to Club SixSixtySix.

476
00:44:09.783 --> 00:44:10.685
Now, let's roll.

477
00:44:11.544 --> 00:44:21.544
Wait! Follow them, yes, but don't interfere.
I have a much more amusing idea.


478

00:44:42.220 --> 00:44:46.620
Oh boy! Mutants in
the foyer of the club!

481
00:44:47.230 --> 00:44:49.123
Isn't it neat-o!

482

club in the city, ya know.

487
00:45:08.228 --> 00:45:12.428

spoils everything, know what I mean honey?

488

Hey Omar, where's this tattoo
supposed to be anyway?


493
00:45:45.768 --> 00:45:48.700
It could be on
her arm, or her leg...

494
00:45:48.701 --> 00:45:51.731
Or promiscuously anywhere!

495

this guy had just gone too far so


501
00:46:36.370 --> 00:46:41.937

history was prematurely and tragically interrupted last night


573
00:54:04.030 --> 00:54:09.920

Carnegie Hall and blacked out the entire city.

"wow, bad karma, man." Our cameras are on the scene....

made me do was wanna, like, wax the floor,

so like, can you tell me, like, is this concert
for real, or is it just another rip off?
