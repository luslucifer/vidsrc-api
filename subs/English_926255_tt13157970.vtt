00:00:27.708 --> 00:00:30.681
(Birds squeaking in distance)

00:00:35.658 --> 00:00:40.567
( Ppppj)

4
00:01:11.262 --> 00:01:13.100
We live in la.

5
00:01:13.333 --> 00:01:14.334
(Gasps)

6
00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.370
- Wow.
- Oh, my god.


7
00:01:15.537 --> 00:01:17.375
Well, it's the valley,
technically, but...


8
00:01:17.608 --> 00:01:19.011
Oh, semantics.

9
00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:21.751
Oh, my god. I love it.

10
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.324
You did so good.

11
00:01:25.557 --> 00:01:27.361
Yeah, we are lucky, wow.

12
00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:29.331
The ceilings.

13
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.438
Well, look at the kitchen.

14
00:01:32.671 --> 00:01:33.672
(Chuckles)

15
00:01:36.045 --> 00:01:37.725
I'm gonna cook you
some good dinner right here.


16
00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:39.920
All right, fancy.

17
00:01:41.656 --> 00:01:43.493
- Oh my...
- Jeez.


18
00:01:47.368 --> 00:01:49.205
- Hey.
- Hey.


19
00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.111
Uh, can I help you?

20
00:01:52.344 --> 00:01:53.345
Maybe.

21
00:01:53.547 --> 00:01:54.548
(Peter laughs)

22
00:01:55.317 --> 00:01:56.921
You must be Brad, huh?

23
00:01:58.323 --> 00:01:59.827
Oh, uh, Peter.

24
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.061
That's... that's me.

25
00:02:01.262 --> 00:02:02.031
All right.

26
00:02:02.264 --> 00:02:02.799
Hey, man.

27
00:02:03.033 --> 00:02:04.202
- Scared me for a bit.
- No.


28
00:02:04.435 --> 00:02:05.436
(Indistinct speech)

29
00:02:05.537 --> 00:02:06.850
You came to meet...
You didn't need to do that.


30
00:02:06.874 --> 00:02:07.475
You came to meet us. Thanks.

31
00:02:07.708 --> 00:02:08.709
Well, you know what?

32
00:02:08.744 --> 00:02:10.414
My father built this place

33
00:02:10.647 --> 00:02:12.394
and so I absolutely
have to come and meet you.


34
00:02:12.418 --> 00:02:14.589
Well, thank you.
Thank you so much.


35
00:02:14.823 --> 00:02:16.894
Well, you know uh, uh...

36
00:02:17.762 --> 00:02:18.396
It's great. It's beautiful.

37
00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.567
Yeah, no, you... you... you uh...

38
00:02:20.802 --> 00:02:21.843
Beautiful, beautiful spot.

39
00:02:22.004 --> 00:02:24.006
It ain't none of my business,
but uh, you look like


40
00:02:24.075 --> 00:02:25.721
you could afford something
a little better.


41
00:02:25.745 --> 00:02:28.383
Hah! We actually sold everything

42
00:02:28.617 --> 00:02:30.420
that didn't fit into our car,
so...


43
00:02:30.654 --> 00:02:31.322
Well, I won't to ask you

44
00:02:31.556 --> 00:02:33.293
how come that all happened,
but uh...


45
00:02:33.527 --> 00:02:35.209
Yeah, we just were...
We were appreciative.


46
00:02:35.397 --> 00:02:36.065
Oh, one of them things, right?

47
00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:37.067
Yeah. Let me introduce you
to my uh...


48
00:02:37.301 --> 00:02:38.713
Jess:
Baby, get that sexy ass in here.


49
00:02:38.738 --> 00:02:39.739
My wife.

50
00:02:41.242 --> 00:02:42.913
This is my wife, Jess.

51
00:02:43.748 --> 00:02:45.217
This is one of those things.

52
00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:46.754
- What an entrance.
- (Laughing)


53
00:02:46.987 --> 00:02:48.256
Brad: This is... this is Jess.

54
00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:50.661
Yeah, Jess, this is...
This is Peter.


55
00:02:50.895 --> 00:02:51.663
Hi, Peter.

56
00:02:51.897 --> 00:02:54.101
That's quite
an opening statement there.


57
00:02:54.335 --> 00:02:56.606
I'm sorry, I... I didn't know
you were out here.


58
00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:57.274
Well, I am.

59
00:02:57.508 --> 00:02:58.509
It's so nice to meet you.

60
00:02:58.543 --> 00:02:59.624
Very nice to meet you, too.

61
00:02:59.813 --> 00:03:02.184
Yeah, I was... I was just telling
uh, Peter how lucky we are


62
00:03:02.418 --> 00:03:04.488
that it... spot's
fully furnished and...


63
00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.461
It's amazing, it's beautiful.
I love it.


64
00:03:07.695 --> 00:03:08.697
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

65
00:03:08.931 --> 00:03:11.045
Listen, uh, you don't have
more... more things, do you,


66
00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:11.636
to bring up, and...

67
00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.874
We're okay, luckily.

68
00:03:14.108 --> 00:03:15.587
Well, that's... that's...
That's cool.


69
00:03:15.611 --> 00:03:17.014
Because I can't help you
with it.


70
00:03:17.247 --> 00:03:19.786
(Laughing)

71
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.826
I... it sounds funny, but I...
I... I got a busted shoulder.


72
00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:24.930
- Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
- Yeah, man.


73
00:03:25.163 --> 00:03:29.605
My uh, my rotator cuff,
it's just ripped in half, man.


74
00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.218
Those are tough,
tough to heal from.


75
00:03:31.242 --> 00:03:33.046
- Yeah, oh, yeah.
- Well...


76
00:03:33.279 --> 00:03:35.717
It was um, it was really nice
to meet you, Peter.


77
00:03:35.952 --> 00:03:37.254
- I'm right behind you.
- Okay.


78
00:03:38.289 --> 00:03:40.728
Uh, uh...

79
00:03:40.962 --> 00:03:41.964
She's good looking.

80
00:03:42.197 --> 00:03:44.669
I got it, I got it.
I'm a lucky guy.


81
00:03:44.903 --> 00:03:45.637
(Laughs)

82
00:03:45.872 --> 00:03:47.274
I'm a lucky... 
I'm a lucky guy.

83
00:03:47.508 --> 00:03:48.844
You did well, sir.

84
00:03:49.078 --> 00:03:50.514
Thank you, thank you.

85
00:03:50.748 --> 00:03:53.553
Um, so uh, cool.

86
00:03:53.788 --> 00:03:55.133
I guess...
I guess we're all right.


87
00:03:55.157 --> 00:03:58.163
Thank you once again for...
For coming to meet us


88
00:03:58.396 --> 00:04:01.002
and uh, you know,
kind of a welcome wagon.


89
00:04:01.235 --> 00:04:02.671
- Hey listen, my pleasure.
- Yeah.


90
00:04:02.906 --> 00:04:04.251
My pleasure
and you have a good time.


91
00:04:04.275 --> 00:04:05.687
Absolutely.
Will I see you around, or...


92
00:04:05.711 --> 00:04:06.793
I'll be all over the place.

93
00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.383
- Okay, cool.
- Excellent.


94
00:04:08.616 --> 00:04:10.454
- Hey.
- My man, Peter.


95
00:04:10.687 --> 00:04:12.033
- Take care.
- All right, thank you, man.


96
00:04:12.057 --> 00:04:13.058
All right.

97
00:04:14.495 --> 00:04:20.240
Um, so um, did you have uh...
Do you have any questions for?


98
00:04:20.474 --> 00:04:20.975
- _no?
- Jess: No.


99
00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:22.210
All right.

100
00:04:22.377 --> 00:04:23.378
Hey.

101
00:04:23.513 --> 00:04:25.684
Yeah, if we have any questions,
we'll find you.


102
00:04:25.918 --> 00:04:26.919
Mmhmm.

103
00:04:28.991 --> 00:04:30.026
Bye now.

104
00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:38.343
(Laughs)

105
00:04:38.576 --> 00:04:39.577
Brad: Ooh.

106
00:04:52.004 --> 00:04:53.941
Peter is a character, huh?

107
00:04:54.175 --> 00:04:55.710
Yeah, well,
that was embarrassing.


108
00:04:57.581 --> 00:04:59.685
- Did he leave?
- Uh, yeah.


109
00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:01.957
Just wanted to make sure
we got in okay.


110
00:05:02.191 --> 00:05:03.192
Mm, cute.

111
00:05:03.226 --> 00:05:04.328
Mmhmm.

112
00:05:07.034 --> 00:05:08.503
What are we looking at?

113
00:05:08.737 --> 00:05:10.040
Our garden.

114
00:05:11.142 --> 00:05:12.143
Okay.

115
00:05:12.344 --> 00:05:13.981
You want a garden?

116
00:05:14.215 --> 00:05:16.787
I want to grow something,
together.


117
00:05:18.656 --> 00:05:20.527
Well, all right.

118
00:05:20.761 --> 00:05:22.064
You will have your garden.

119
00:05:23.868 --> 00:05:26.505
Yeah, but that stump
is annoying.


120
00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:28.777
Stupid stump.

121
00:05:29.011 --> 00:05:30.413
Maybe we should name it Brad.

122
00:05:37.094 --> 00:05:40.667
You're uh... you're not talking
about a real garden, are you?


123
00:05:40.902 --> 00:05:42.437
I don't know, am I?

124
00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:57.100
Such a dick, Brad.

125
00:06:02.077 --> 00:06:03.479
Garden.

126
00:06:04.581 --> 00:06:06.419
(Sighs)

127
00:06:09.893 --> 00:06:14.803
( Pj'j'j'j)

128
00:06:16.907 --> 00:06:18.777
Brad: Did you pay off the visa?

129
00:06:19.011 --> 00:06:21.582
Jess: Paid off the
mastercard with the visa.


130
00:06:21.817 --> 00:06:23.286
God, this color looks like ass.

131
00:06:23.519 --> 00:06:25.690
Brad: Babe, the visa
has a higher interest rate.


132
00:06:27.327 --> 00:06:28.648
I still have to buy
the fermenters


133
00:06:28.764 --> 00:06:29.465
for the brewmaster.

134
00:06:29.698 --> 00:06:31.168
And what the hell is his name?

135
00:06:31.402 --> 00:06:32.772
- Derek?
- Derek.


136
00:06:33.907 --> 00:06:34.908
What's a fermenter?

137
00:06:35.043 --> 00:06:37.347
Uh, to make the beer.

138
00:06:37.581 --> 00:06:38.751
Didn't we already buy those?

139
00:06:38.984 --> 00:06:40.553
No, we bought the church

140
00:06:40.788 --> 00:06:42.524
and for a bargain I'd buy that.

141
00:06:42.759 --> 00:06:44.361
The pastor running off
with the secretary


142
00:06:44.595 --> 00:06:46.867
and all the congregation's money
was probably a factor.


143
00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:49.371
Focus, babe. Fermenters.

144
00:06:54.415 --> 00:06:56.118
What about
that investor's money?


145
00:06:56.352 --> 00:06:59.358
No, the investor's money
is for taking into a church


146
00:06:59.591 --> 00:07:02.564
and turning it into a brew pub,
not for the equipment.


147
00:07:03.633 --> 00:07:04.634
B rewery.

148
00:07:06.138 --> 00:07:08.476
No, brew pub's cooler, right?
Brew pub.


149
00:07:08.709 --> 00:07:09.411
Is it cool?

150
00:07:09.645 --> 00:07:10.891
Look, we're calling it
a "brew pub".


151
00:07:10.915 --> 00:07:12.952
Oh, okay, brew pub.

152
00:07:13.186 --> 00:07:14.664
Yeah, we got to buy
the brewing equipment,


153
00:07:14.688 --> 00:07:16.793
so which card should I use?

154
00:07:17.027 --> 00:07:18.730
I just told you.
Use the mastercard.


155
00:07:18.964 --> 00:07:20.768
- Oh, that mastercard.
- Yes.


156
00:07:21.001 --> 00:07:22.002
It's in your wallet.

157
00:07:23.072 --> 00:07:24.708
Okay.

158
00:07:24.943 --> 00:07:25.643
Thank you, baby.

159
00:07:25.878 --> 00:07:27.581
(Grunts)

160
00:07:27.815 --> 00:07:29.929
Baby, when you get back,
will you give me a foot massage?


161
00:07:29.953 --> 00:07:30.587
Brad: Nope.

162
00:07:30.821 --> 00:07:31.489
Please?

163
00:07:31.723 --> 00:07:32.724
Brad: Okay.

164
00:07:32.825 --> 00:07:33.927
I love you.

165
00:07:34.161 --> 00:07:35.162
Brad: Love you, too.

166
00:07:39.538 --> 00:07:41.910
Jess: Babe, can I put
my jewelry on your side?


167
00:07:42.144 --> 00:07:44.081
I don't have any room on mine.

168
00:07:44.314 --> 00:07:46.085
Brad: Yeah, yeah,
yeah, baby. It's fine.


169
00:07:46.318 --> 00:07:48.724
Jess: So what do you want
to do with that spare bedroom?


170
00:07:48.957 --> 00:07:51.095
Brad: Yeah, I tried the
door, but it was locked.


171
00:07:52.497 --> 00:07:55.637
Brad: Uh, that could
be a home office, maybe.


172
00:07:55.871 --> 00:07:58.376
Jess: Well, that's
shitty. Did you tell Peter?


173
00:07:58.609 --> 00:08:00.915
Brad:
No, no, it's not a big deal.


174
00:08:06.592 --> 00:08:07.795
Okay.

175
00:08:14.208 --> 00:08:15.529
I was thinking that
maybe we could


176
00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:17.347
turn it into a nursery?

177
00:08:17.581 --> 00:08:20.253
Brad:
Jess, we cannot afford a baby


178
00:08:20.486 --> 00:08:21.966
when we're trying
to start a new business.


179
00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:23.392
I keep telling you that.

180
00:08:23.626 --> 00:08:24.361
Can you just give me a second?

181
00:08:24.595 --> 00:08:27.367
I got to respond
to this bullshit email.


182
00:08:27.601 --> 00:08:28.369
Jess: What email?

183
00:08:28.603 --> 00:08:30.182
Brad: These pricks
from the historical society.


184
00:08:30.206 --> 00:08:31.776
They want me
to restore the steeple.


185
00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:33.747
- Can you believe that?
- Are you serious?


186
00:08:33.981 --> 00:08:36.252
Yes, it's gonna cut
into half of our entire budget.


187
00:08:36.485 --> 00:08:38.456
- No. Oh, my god.
- Yeah.


188
00:08:38.689 --> 00:08:42.330
The bitch who runs the committee
is a real Hitler.


189
00:08:42.564 --> 00:08:44.067
If Hitler was a cat lady.

190
00:08:45.603 --> 00:08:46.806
(Loud thud)

191
00:08:52.852 --> 00:08:54.588
Did the air kick on
or something?


192
00:08:54.822 --> 00:08:57.762
Yeah... probably.

193
00:08:57.995 --> 00:08:59.264
Probably?

194
00:08:59.498 --> 00:09:00.877
Yeah, it was either
the air-conditioning


195
00:09:00.901 --> 00:09:03.539
or... or a ghost.

196
00:09:03.774 --> 00:09:04.775
Don't fucking do that.

197
00:09:04.976 --> 00:09:06.078
What?

198
00:09:10.353 --> 00:09:15.263
( Pj'j'j'j)

199
00:09:25.450 --> 00:09:26.753
Brad: You cool?

200
00:09:26.986 --> 00:09:28.422
Jess: Yup.

201
00:09:28.656 --> 00:09:30.560
Come here.

202
00:09:30.794 --> 00:09:32.497
Brad: (Indistinct speech)

203
00:09:34.368 --> 00:09:39.411
( Pj'j'j'j)

204
00:10:39.866 --> 00:10:42.504
Brad's dad: A man takes
responsibility for his actions.


205
00:10:42.738 --> 00:10:45.176
You brought this bitch home.

206
00:10:45.409 --> 00:10:46.645
Now do it.

207
00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:48.682
Pick that shit up. Now!

208
00:10:48.917 --> 00:10:50.119
I said do it, Brad.

209
00:10:50.353 --> 00:10:51.634
What the fuck is wrong with you?

210
00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:12.530
( Pj'j'j'j)

211
00:11:17.407 --> 00:11:20.479

(Banging on door)

214
00:12:10.546 --> 00:12:13.452
Jess... did you hear that?

215
00:12:25.276 --> 00:12:30.086
( Pj'j'j'j)

216
00:12:40.406 --> 00:12:42.210
- (Loud thud)
- Shit.


217
00:13:12.603 --> 00:13:17.513
( Pj'j'j'j)

218
00:13:26.498 --> 00:13:28.468
Oh no. Mmm-mmm, mmm-mmm.

219
00:13:55.689 --> 00:13:57.360
- Brad.
- Oh, my gosh.


220
00:13:57.593 --> 00:13:58.262
Jesus.

221
00:13:58.495 --> 00:14:00.901
Hey, you're so on edge.

222
00:14:02.003 --> 00:14:04.909
Uh, protecting
the Swedish home décor?


223
00:14:05.142 --> 00:14:05.844
(Jess laughs)

224
00:14:06.077 --> 00:14:07.280
That is lame.

225
00:14:07.513 --> 00:14:11.521
Uh... I think uh,
I think there are mice in there


226
00:14:11.756 --> 00:14:12.290
or something.

227
00:14:12.523 --> 00:14:13.725
What? I thought it was locked.

228
00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:15.764
Yeah, I did too. It's not.

229
00:14:17.133 --> 00:14:19.070
- I'll call Peter in the morning.
- Okay.


230
00:14:19.304 --> 00:14:21.641
Meanwhile, try not to stab me
with those little wrenches.


231
00:14:23.312 --> 00:14:25.149
It's hilarious.

232
00:14:25.382 --> 00:14:26.627
Could really go for
some Swedish meatballs


233
00:14:26.651 --> 00:14:27.186
right about now.

234
00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:28.665
I got your meatballs right here.

235
00:14:28.689 --> 00:14:29.457
- Ooh.
- (Jess laughs)


236
00:14:29.691 --> 00:14:30.727
I like they're meatballs.

237
00:14:32.831 --> 00:14:33.833
(Brad laughs)

238
00:14:34.067 --> 00:14:35.469
Brad:
Don't have to tell me twice.


239
00:14:35.703 --> 00:14:36.772

- Peter on phone: Hey.
- Hey Peter.


244
00:15:54.127 --> 00:15:55.429
Hi, yeah, this is Jess.

245
00:15:55.662 --> 00:15:56.975
Uh, me and my husband
are running...


246
00:15:56.999 --> 00:15:58.000
Peter on phone: Brad.

247
00:15:59.137 --> 00:16:01.909
You know, I think we have
a mouse problem upstairs.


248
00:16:02.143 --> 00:16:03.224
Peter on phone: Well, yeah.

249
00:16:03.278 --> 00:16:04.599
Wait, you already knew
about that?


250
00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:06.082
- Peter on phone: Sure enough.
- Oh.


251
00:16:06.117 --> 00:16:07.964
- Peter on phone: Loan help you.
- Okay, that would be amazing.


252
00:16:07.988 --> 00:16:09.056
Yes, okay.

253
00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:10.291
Thank you so much.

254
00:16:10.425 --> 00:16:11.670
- Peter on phone: You're welcome.
- All right.


255
00:16:11.694 --> 00:16:12.764
Yeah, bye.

Jess!

Ow, shit.

277
00:21:24.052 --> 00:21:26.457
Damn it.

Jess.

289
00:21:52.709 --> 00:21:54.313
- I mean, they're gold, right?
- Mmhmm.


290
00:21:54.546 --> 00:21:56.050
They have to be worth something.

291
00:21:56.918 --> 00:21:57.987
Wait, is this it?

292
00:21:58.221 --> 00:21:59.222
Mmhmm.

293
00:22:00.558 --> 00:22:02.930
You know,
see the markings are different.


294
00:22:03.164 --> 00:22:04.633
Right.

295
00:22:05.736 --> 00:22:06.738
Hang on.

296
00:22:09.276 --> 00:22:10.445
What's the matter?

297
00:22:11.948 --> 00:22:14.253
I just don't understand
how it all happened.


298
00:22:15.923 --> 00:22:18.594
Well, it was
in the locked state, right?


299
00:22:18.829 --> 00:22:20.900
Babe, I'm telling you,
the door opened


300
00:22:21.133 --> 00:22:23.337
and slammed shut multiple times.

301
00:22:23.571 --> 00:22:24.072
Multiple times?

302
00:22:24.306 --> 00:22:25.441
I didn't hallucinate shit.

303
00:22:25.675 --> 00:22:26.676
Okay.

304
00:22:27.847 --> 00:22:29.048
- All right.
- What about this?


305
00:22:29.149 --> 00:22:30.886
Mmm-mmm.

306
00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:32.355
- Wait, go back.
- Where?


307
00:22:35.796 --> 00:22:37.532
That's like real.

308
00:22:39.904 --> 00:22:41.473
Why is it worth so much?

309
00:22:41.707 --> 00:22:43.912
I don't know.
I mean, it's just old.


310
00:22:44.146 --> 00:22:45.548
Really old.

311
00:22:45.783 --> 00:22:49.189
But it's... it's not a currency.
It's a religious thing.


312
00:22:50.759 --> 00:22:52.162
Do you think we could sell 'em?

313
00:22:52.395 --> 00:22:54.132
If we don't
restore that steeple,


314
00:22:54.366 --> 00:22:56.503
they're gonna
halt construction, so...


315
00:22:56.738 --> 00:22:58.842
Let's do some more research.

316
00:22:59.076 --> 00:23:01.380
I mean,
if they're worth this much...


317
00:23:01.613 --> 00:23:02.694
If they're worth this much,

318
00:23:02.883 --> 00:23:05.621
then it's all going
to the brew pub.


319
00:23:06.891 --> 00:23:08.361
Okay, we'll figure it out
tomorrow.


320
00:23:08.594 --> 00:23:09.731
Okay.

(Sighs)

330
00:25:12.508 --> 00:25:17.385
( Ppppj)

331
00:25:24.967 --> 00:25:26.804
Get in here.

332
00:25:37.926 --> 00:25:39.930
"Prayer of invocation."

333
00:25:42.502 --> 00:25:47.412
(Indistinct speech)

334
00:25:55.127 --> 00:25:56.630
(Laughs)

335
00:26:11.059 --> 00:26:13.397
(Gasps, screams)

336
00:26:13.630 --> 00:26:16.203
Oh, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.


337
00:26:16.436 --> 00:26:18.273
Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.

338
00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:25.287
Yeah, I'm sorry I busted it.

339
00:26:25.521 --> 00:26:29.496
I just uh... I just panicked,
so thanks.


340
00:26:30.264 --> 00:26:31.366
Oh, listen, man.

341
00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:34.774
Uh, I uh... I understand.

342
00:26:36.243 --> 00:26:38.580
I mean, if the fucking house
is on fire and...


343
00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:41.191
You're just looking after
your woman.


344
00:26:43.223 --> 00:26:44.224
I appreciate it.

345
00:26:44.392 --> 00:26:45.762
These things are 5 bucks.

346
00:26:45.996 --> 00:26:46.563
Okay.

347
00:26:46.798 --> 00:26:47.799
So you owe me 5 bucks.

348
00:26:47.833 --> 00:26:49.269
(Laughing)

349
00:26:52.608 --> 00:26:55.916
Oh... there you go.

350
00:26:57.318 --> 00:26:58.319
(Grunts)

351
00:26:59.456 --> 00:27:00.591
What's wrong, man?

352
00:27:00.826 --> 00:27:02.628
Oh, nothing, nothing.

353
00:27:04.499 --> 00:27:05.267
Something on your mind.

354
00:27:05.501 --> 00:27:06.971
(Laughs)

355
00:27:08.373 --> 00:27:09.442
Uh, it's my lady.

356
00:27:11.513 --> 00:27:13.150
- Good luck.
- Yeah.


357
00:27:14.519 --> 00:27:15.731
As soon as we started
getting serious,


358
00:27:15.755 --> 00:27:18.862
the first question she asked me,
the very first question,


359
00:27:19.095 --> 00:27:21.934
how many kids do I want?

360
00:27:22.168 --> 00:27:23.738
First question.

361
00:27:23.972 --> 00:27:26.710
And uh, I mean,
I want kids, I do.


362
00:27:26.944 --> 00:27:29.984
I just, you know,
just not right now.


363
00:27:30.217 --> 00:27:32.154
It's a bit much.

364
00:27:32.388 --> 00:27:35.561
Yeah, it's not something
you just jump into.


365
00:27:35.795 --> 00:27:38.801
You know, you have no idea
what you're gonna


366
00:27:39.035 --> 00:27:41.039
pass on to your kid.

367
00:27:41.273 --> 00:27:42.275
You know what I mean?

368
00:27:42.508 --> 00:27:43.811
I had a wife once upon a time.

369
00:27:44.045 --> 00:27:45.414
Brad: Okay.

370
00:27:47.485 --> 00:27:48.646
We were together a long time.

371
00:27:48.855 --> 00:27:49.489
Sorry to hear that.

372
00:27:49.723 --> 00:27:51.727
Peter:
I was in for the long run.


373
00:27:51.961 --> 00:27:54.499
And uh,
we both wanted to have kids.


374
00:27:54.733 --> 00:27:55.734
Brad: Hmm.

375
00:27:56.871 --> 00:28:00.110
But we figured, you know,
if we waited for a while,


376
00:28:00.344 --> 00:28:02.916
then uh,
it would make more sense.


377
00:28:03.150 --> 00:28:04.511
But we waited a little bit
toolong,


378
00:28:04.586 --> 00:28:08.360
and then she went and died on me
so it never happened.


379
00:28:08.594 --> 00:28:10.140
You know, I would have
liked to have been a father,


380
00:28:10.164 --> 00:28:13.403
but it wasn't meant to be,
isuppose.


381
00:28:16.376 --> 00:28:18.113
I'm sorry.

382
00:28:18.347 --> 00:28:20.093
Well, I mean I get it,
you know what I'm saying,


383
00:28:20.117 --> 00:28:22.188
it's a... it's a tough thing.

384
00:28:23.858 --> 00:28:25.270
I'll give you some advice
if you want.


385
00:28:25.294 --> 00:28:26.295
Brad: Please.

386
00:28:26.396 --> 00:28:28.078
Man, if she wants to have one,
I'd have it,


387
00:28:28.233 --> 00:28:30.905
regardless of what...
What it's gonna inherit,


388
00:28:31.139 --> 00:28:32.708
your bad side
or your bad things,


389
00:28:32.943 --> 00:28:34.646
it will probably get
your good stuff, too.


390
00:28:38.253 --> 00:28:40.190
You see that?
You know what that is?


391
00:28:42.094 --> 00:28:43.330
I do not.

392
00:28:43.563 --> 00:28:46.102
All right, it's this guy
named dismas.


393
00:28:46.336 --> 00:28:47.337
Dismas.

394
00:28:47.405 --> 00:28:51.479
Yeah, he was...
The patron Saint of someone


395
00:28:51.713 --> 00:28:53.617
- who's not worth saving.
- Oh.


396
00:28:53.851 --> 00:28:55.922
- Something like that.
- Okay.


397
00:28:56.156 --> 00:28:58.293
Anyway, I guess he was,
because he...


398
00:28:58.527 --> 00:29:00.197
They nailed him up
next to Jesus.


399
00:29:02.803 --> 00:29:05.174
Are you about to ask me
if I want to accept Jesus


400
00:29:05.407 --> 00:29:06.408
into my heart?

401
00:29:09.682 --> 00:29:11.721
No, uh, you know what,

402
00:29:11.954 --> 00:29:13.423
I had some bad experiences
as a kid


403
00:29:13.657 --> 00:29:15.127
with the church thing, you know.

404
00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:19.635
Like your wife, my... my father,
in a way, my dad was like


405
00:29:19.870 --> 00:29:20.571
- a lot of money.
- Mmhmm.


406
00:29:20.805 --> 00:29:22.608
- More than he needed.
- Hmm.


407
00:29:22.843 --> 00:29:24.445
But he was pretty hard on me,
you know.


408
00:29:24.679 --> 00:29:26.549
He was not a nice guy.

409
00:29:26.784 --> 00:29:27.953
I get that.

410
00:29:29.890 --> 00:29:31.761
Stays with you.

411
00:29:31.994 --> 00:29:32.995
It does.

412
00:29:33.063 --> 00:29:36.169
That stuff uh, it does
tend to stay with you.


413
00:29:36.402 --> 00:29:38.006
How do you know that?

414
00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:41.713
I just, you know...
Me and my dad, we didn't...


415
00:29:41.947 --> 00:29:43.650
- We didn't get along either.
- Mmm-mmm.


416
00:29:43.885 --> 00:29:45.554
- Sorry to hear that.
- Mmhmm.


417
00:29:45.789 --> 00:29:47.191
All good.

418
00:29:47.424 --> 00:29:49.963
May he rest in peace.

419
00:29:50.197 --> 00:29:51.834
Both of 'em.

420
00:29:52.067 --> 00:29:53.303
Mine and yours.

421
00:30:03.423 --> 00:30:08.600
( Ppppj)

422
00:30:10.337 --> 00:30:13.243
(Indistinct whispering)

423
00:30:16.282 --> 00:30:17.953
Hey. Peter, real quick.

424
00:30:18.186 --> 00:30:19.255
What... what happened?

425
00:30:19.488 --> 00:30:22.361
We uh... we found this book
in the... in the second bedroom.


426
00:30:22.595 --> 00:30:24.541
And I didn't know if uh...
If it meant anything to you.


427
00:30:24.565 --> 00:30:25.902
It looks...

428
00:30:26.135 --> 00:30:27.180
You know, that looks
like something


429
00:30:27.204 --> 00:30:28.607
that belonged to my father.

430
00:30:29.743 --> 00:30:31.064
He had a bunch
of that stuff, man.


431
00:30:31.212 --> 00:30:32.213
I don't know what it was.

432
00:30:32.314 --> 00:30:34.485
I uh... (Laughs)

433
00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:36.281
I got all the money
and everything else.


434
00:30:37.424 --> 00:30:39.662
But he was into
some strange things, and...


435
00:30:39.897 --> 00:30:41.532
Wait, like... like freaky stuff?
Like...


436
00:30:41.767 --> 00:30:45.040
Well, I don't know, like he did
have a bunch of stuff like that.


437
00:30:45.274 --> 00:30:47.478
It was like a secret society
or uh...


438
00:30:47.711 --> 00:30:49.015
Like the occult?

439
00:30:49.248 --> 00:30:51.119
Uh, I guess
you could call it that.


440
00:30:51.352 --> 00:30:53.390
I mean, I didn't really
give a shit


441
00:30:53.623 --> 00:30:54.726
- honestly.
- Right.


442
00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:58.166
But I definitely recognize that,
but I don't know what's in it.


443
00:30:58.400 --> 00:30:59.836
- Okay.
- I didn't want to know.


444
00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:01.439
All right, so you can have it.

445
00:31:01.673 --> 00:31:02.776
For real?

446
00:31:04.245 --> 00:31:05.423
Peter: If you find anything
else for me, let me know.


447
00:31:05.447 --> 00:31:07.718
- Yes, I will.
- Peter: Okay.


448
00:31:07.953 --> 00:31:09.790
Secret society, cool.
All right, thanks, man.


449
00:31:10.023 --> 00:31:11.704
I don't know
what the hell it is, man, I...


450
00:31:14.733 --> 00:31:15.802
- Jess: Hey, babe.
- Hmm.


451
00:31:16.035 --> 00:31:17.772
Jess: Where's the mastercard?

452
00:31:18.006 --> 00:31:19.384
I thought we said
we wouldn't charge anything


453
00:31:19.408 --> 00:31:20.878
unless it was for the business.

454
00:31:22.681 --> 00:31:25.654
Just hungry. Want pizza.

455
00:31:25.888 --> 00:31:27.324
Pizza,
you don't even like pizza.


456
00:31:27.558 --> 00:31:28.639
What are you talking about?

457
00:31:28.728 --> 00:31:30.965
People change and I want pizza.

458
00:31:31.199 --> 00:31:33.069
Okay, well,
find the credit card,


459
00:31:33.303 --> 00:31:35.073
order yourself up some pizza.

460
00:31:35.307 --> 00:31:37.011
Will you help me?

461
00:31:37.244 --> 00:31:39.950
Yeah, just a minute, babe,
my inboxjust blew up.


462
00:31:40.183 --> 00:31:41.219
All right, fine.

463
00:31:41.452 --> 00:31:43.323
I'm gonna get some wine.
Do you want some?


464
00:31:43.556 --> 00:31:45.327
Yeah, uh, not red though.

465
00:31:52.909 --> 00:31:58.053
( Ppppj)

466
00:32:14.418 --> 00:32:15.798
Jess: Did you decide what
you want to do with these?


467
00:32:15.822 --> 00:32:17.959
Damn. She died.

468
00:32:19.161 --> 00:32:20.330
Jess: What? Who?

469
00:32:20.564 --> 00:32:23.904
Cat lady Hitler, from the
historical preservation society.


470
00:32:24.138 --> 00:32:25.273
She's dead.

471
00:32:25.507 --> 00:32:27.846
What? How?

472
00:32:28.079 --> 00:32:30.650
Mmm. Uh, I don't know.

473
00:32:30.885 --> 00:32:34.860
I just got an email
from the city administrator.


474
00:32:35.093 --> 00:32:35.761
So does that mean

475
00:32:35.995 --> 00:32:37.598
we don't have to restore
the steeple?


476
00:32:37.832 --> 00:32:39.068
Uh no, we still do.

477
00:32:39.301 --> 00:32:41.606
But they said they would
pay for it.


478
00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:44.044
They're gonna give us a Grant.

479
00:32:44.278 --> 00:32:47.317
- Wait, what the hell.
- Yeah.


480
00:32:47.551 --> 00:32:50.758
A tourism Grant
to finish restoring


481
00:32:50.992 --> 00:32:53.831
the rest of the church
for $900,000.


482
00:32:54.064 --> 00:32:55.333
$900,000?

483
00:32:55.567 --> 00:32:56.302
Holy shit.

484
00:32:56.536 --> 00:32:59.041
Holy shit. Holy shit.

485
00:32:59.275 --> 00:33:02.381
(Both laugh)

486
00:33:03.583 --> 00:33:07.157
$900,000. $900,000.

487
00:33:07.391 --> 00:33:08.469
That's a little bit wide,
but that's good.


488
00:33:08.493 --> 00:33:09.528
- Come here.
- Yeah!


489
00:33:09.763 --> 00:33:11.632
(Both cheer)

490
00:33:13.036 --> 00:33:15.273
Jess: I mean, do we
even need all of that?


491
00:33:15.507 --> 00:33:16.508
(Brad laughs)

492
00:33:16.542 --> 00:33:18.847
You know, if we don't use it,
we lose it.


493
00:33:19.081 --> 00:33:21.352
But it is plenty to get
this business off the ground,


494
00:33:21.586 --> 00:33:23.089
that's for damn sure.

495
00:33:24.291 --> 00:33:25.660
Then we can sell the coins.

496
00:33:27.564 --> 00:33:28.565
I don't know.

497
00:33:28.666 --> 00:33:30.905
I mean, part of me thinks
maybe we shouldn't.


498
00:33:32.274 --> 00:33:34.578
I mean,
we don't have to now, right?


499
00:33:34.813 --> 00:33:37.919
No, but not for the business.

500
00:33:38.152 --> 00:33:39.723
For us.

501
00:33:39.956 --> 00:33:41.727
So we can start a family.

502
00:33:43.096 --> 00:33:44.733
- Oh, baby.
- Come on.


503
00:33:44.966 --> 00:33:46.937
It's not the right time,
it's not, baby.


504
00:33:47.170 --> 00:33:48.673
- (Grunts)
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.


505
00:33:48.907 --> 00:33:51.145
Look, I told you this.

506
00:33:51.379 --> 00:33:53.516
When we moved out here,
I told you,


507
00:33:53.751 --> 00:33:55.721
I need to focus
on this business.


508
00:33:57.391 --> 00:33:59.028
I just need a couple more years.

509
00:34:00.363 --> 00:34:02.100
Look, this is a good thing.

510
00:34:03.871 --> 00:34:06.375
All right? You'll see,
time will fly by.


511
00:34:07.611 --> 00:34:09.081
Okay?

512
00:34:09.315 --> 00:34:10.951
- Promise me?
- I promise you.


513
00:34:12.487 --> 00:34:13.724
You believe me?

514
00:34:13.957 --> 00:34:15.403
Mmhmm, a little bit,
I need some more.


515
00:34:15.427 --> 00:34:16.595
You believe me?

516
00:34:17.999 --> 00:34:19.702
Getting there.

517
00:34:24.913 --> 00:34:29.823
( Ppppj)

518
00:34:39.843 --> 00:34:42.280
You can't destroy them.
That's absurd.


519
00:34:42.514 --> 00:34:44.518
(Grunts)

520
00:34:44.753 --> 00:34:46.757
I'm working on the money.
I already tol...


521
00:34:50.697 --> 00:34:52.033
How long do I have?

522
00:34:56.910 --> 00:34:57.912
You don't understand.

523
00:34:58.146 --> 00:35:00.717
I have a medical condition,
there is no other option.


524
00:35:02.587 --> 00:35:04.158
Hello? Hello?

525
00:35:06.295 --> 00:35:07.397
(Sighs)

526
00:35:33.917 --> 00:35:35.019
What?

527
00:35:47.477 --> 00:35:52.187
( Ppppj)

528
00:35:53.623 --> 00:35:55.627
So they didn't have the vodka
I was looking for.


529
00:35:57.999 --> 00:35:59.969
Oh, and babe, I saw that stump,

530
00:36:00.203 --> 00:36:01.404
you almost got that thing out.

531
00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:03.341
Jess: Good job.

532
00:36:03.476 --> 00:36:04.477
(Chuckles)

533
00:36:06.215 --> 00:36:07.216
What's wrong?

534
00:36:07.317 --> 00:36:10.623
Uh hey, I got a uh, I got a text
from mastercard


535
00:36:10.858 --> 00:36:13.797
that said that they flagged
a suspicious charge.


536
00:36:14.031 --> 00:36:15.266
- Brad.
- For...


537
00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:16.035
I can explain.

538
00:36:16.268 --> 00:36:19.074
It's for 30,000... $30,000.

539
00:36:21.612 --> 00:36:23.015
I can explain.

540
00:36:23.249 --> 00:36:24.250
Why didn't you...

541
00:36:25.888 --> 00:36:27.825
Okay, why didn't you come to me?

542
00:36:28.059 --> 00:36:30.530
I've been coming to you
for over a year.


543
00:36:30.764 --> 00:36:31.765
Okay.

544
00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:33.780
You know how important
having this baby is to me.


545
00:36:33.804 --> 00:36:35.373
- Okay.
- Every time I bring it up,


546
00:36:35.607 --> 00:36:37.143
you push it aside
like it's nothing.


547
00:36:37.377 --> 00:36:38.112
Okay.

548
00:36:38.346 --> 00:36:39.587
This is everything to me, Brad.

549
00:36:39.615 --> 00:36:40.951
Do you not...
Do you not trust me?


550
00:36:41.185 --> 00:36:42.867
Because I've been...
I've been telling you.


551
00:36:43.089 --> 00:36:45.693
- Of course, I trust you.
- Well... obviously you don't.


552
00:36:45.928 --> 00:36:49.201
'Cause you just spent $30,000
on a... on fertility.


553
00:36:49.434 --> 00:36:50.435
Baby, I'm... I'm sorry.

554
00:36:50.570 --> 00:36:52.808
What... what even is it?
What is it? What is it?


555
00:36:53.042 --> 00:36:54.879
- Ivf therapy.
- What? Okay, sorry, I'm sorry.


556
00:36:55.113 --> 00:36:56.114
Ivf therapy.

557
00:36:56.215 --> 00:36:57.416
Okay, what is that? I'm sorry.

558
00:36:57.617 --> 00:37:00.123
They are holding my eggs
until I'm ready.


559
00:37:00.356 --> 00:37:00.791
Or until we're ready.

560
00:37:01.025 --> 00:37:02.066
They're holding your eggs?

561
00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:03.864
- Yes!
- What, who...


562
00:37:04.097 --> 00:37:05.658
I had to pay for
the next storage period


563
00:37:05.768 --> 00:37:07.537
or they were gonna
throw them out.


564
00:37:07.772 --> 00:37:09.641
Jess, I'm freaking
the fuck out here right now.


565
00:37:09.876 --> 00:37:10.510
Jess: Don't freak out, baby.

566
00:37:10.744 --> 00:37:12.647
Don't tell me not to freak out.

567
00:37:12.882 --> 00:37:16.288
Because we don't have $30,000.
That was our...


568
00:37:16.522 --> 00:37:16.956
You lied to me!

569
00:37:17.190 --> 00:37:19.194
It's a child. It's a baby.

570
00:37:19.428 --> 00:37:21.933
Why did you lie to me?

571
00:37:22.167 --> 00:37:24.104
You're fucking with our money.

572
00:37:24.872 --> 00:37:27.444
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Brad.

573
00:37:27.677 --> 00:37:28.446
Okay, all right, okay.

574
00:37:28.679 --> 00:37:29.892
Jess:
Because you don't listen to me.


575
00:37:29.916 --> 00:37:31.251
Okay, all right.

576
00:37:31.485 --> 00:37:32.764
- Jess: You don't...
- All right.


577
00:37:32.788 --> 00:37:33.289
I've come to you so many times...

578
00:37:33.522 --> 00:37:34.157
Just so you know, because...

579
00:37:34.391 --> 00:37:35.526
Listen to me. Listen to me.

580
00:37:35.761 --> 00:37:37.664
Don't touch me. 
Don't touch me.

581
00:37:37.898 --> 00:37:38.632
Jess: Don't tell
me not to touch you.


582
00:37:38.867 --> 00:37:39.501
Listen.

583
00:37:39.736 --> 00:37:41.572
Just so you know,

584
00:37:41.806 --> 00:37:44.644
that was our last line
of credit. All right?


585
00:37:44.879 --> 00:37:48.352
And now we can't buy groceries,
okay?


586
00:37:48.586 --> 00:37:51.125
So that's what happens
when you don't discuss


587
00:37:51.358 --> 00:37:53.997
fucking fertility
with your husband!


588
00:37:54.231 --> 00:37:54.766
(Jess sobbing)

589
00:37:54.999 --> 00:37:56.535
- Brad, I'm sorry.
- Oh, my god.


590
00:37:56.770 --> 00:37:57.891
- I'm so sorry, Brad.
- Fuck!


591
00:37:57.972 --> 00:37:59.842
No, I'm sorry.

592
00:38:02.782 --> 00:38:03.783
(Sobbing)

593
00:38:10.062 --> 00:38:11.064
Jess.

594
00:38:11.298 --> 00:38:12.467
(Brad clears throat)

595
00:38:16.375 --> 00:38:21.218
( Ppppj)

596
00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:56.756
( Ppppj)

597
00:39:00.196 --> 00:39:01.866
(Sighs)

598
00:39:11.652 --> 00:39:16.763
( Ppppj)

599
00:39:51.365 --> 00:39:56.909
Come on, it's just horrible.
I can't.


600
00:40:01.718 --> 00:40:03.055
(Grunts)

601
00:40:06.261 --> 00:40:09.234
Woah. (Chuckles)

602
00:40:11.405 --> 00:40:12.140
Okay.

603
00:40:12.373 --> 00:40:14.210
(Clears throat)

604
00:40:30.342 --> 00:40:33.182
(Indistinct speech)

605
00:40:34.985 --> 00:40:36.521
Shut up.

606
00:40:53.957 --> 00:40:54.959
Got ya.

607
00:41:10.656 --> 00:41:11.759
Okay.

608
00:41:12.928 --> 00:41:15.834
(Indistinct speech)

609
00:41:56.481 --> 00:41:58.252
Jess:
Is that the door banging again?


610
00:41:58.485 --> 00:42:00.089
Don't freak out. Don't...

611
00:42:00.322 --> 00:42:01.424
Jesus Christ, Brad.

612
00:42:01.658 --> 00:42:02.703
Don't freak out.
Don't freak out.


613
00:42:02.728 --> 00:42:03.872
Don't freak out.
Don't freak out.


614
00:42:03.896 --> 00:42:04.497
What are you doing?

615
00:42:04.732 --> 00:42:05.943
Baby, I told you
not to freak out.


616
00:42:05.967 --> 00:42:07.370
Don't freak out.

617
00:42:07.603 --> 00:42:08.604
Listen.

618
00:42:09.507 --> 00:42:12.146
Okay, I will respect
your boundaries.


619
00:42:13.783 --> 00:42:18.960
I wanted to say
that I am very sorry


620
00:42:19.193 --> 00:42:21.298
for how I treated you before.

621
00:42:22.566 --> 00:42:24.938
Um, you were well
within your rights


622
00:42:25.172 --> 00:42:26.776
to all that you did.

623
00:42:27.009 --> 00:42:30.049
And I gave you no choice.

624
00:42:31.752 --> 00:42:33.021
Oh my god, you're drunk.

625
00:42:33.255 --> 00:42:35.359
I am not Dr... I'm...
I'm a little bit drunk.


626
00:42:35.592 --> 00:42:36.996
But listen, hear me out.

627
00:42:38.065 --> 00:42:41.538
Seriously. Jess, seriously.

628
00:42:41.772 --> 00:42:44.644
I'm so sorry that you felt like
you had to go


629
00:42:44.878 --> 00:42:47.183
behind my back to...

630
00:42:47.416 --> 00:42:49.855
You know me,
I just get so focused on


631
00:42:50.089 --> 00:42:50.824
the business.

632
00:42:51.057 --> 00:42:54.664
And I neglect to... to...
To pay attention


633
00:42:54.898 --> 00:42:57.403
to things that are so...

634
00:42:57.636 --> 00:43:01.010
To what we need to be together.

635
00:43:01.244 --> 00:43:03.115
I need to focus on that.

636
00:43:06.121 --> 00:43:07.356
Jessica.

637
00:43:08.658 --> 00:43:14.203
I promise...
We will have a family.


638
00:43:17.676 --> 00:43:18.412
Yay.

639
00:43:18.645 --> 00:43:19.915
(Indistinct speech)

640
00:43:20.149 --> 00:43:20.884
- Okay.
- Come on.


641
00:43:21.117 --> 00:43:22.754
- I forgive you.
- Okay.


642
00:43:22.988 --> 00:43:24.557
Now can you stop this
ouija bullshit


643
00:43:24.792 --> 00:43:25.159
and come back to bed?

644
00:43:25.392 --> 00:43:27.229
Oh yes, I almost forgot.

645
00:43:27.463 --> 00:43:30.235
Okay.
Now, just stay with me here.


646
00:43:31.104 --> 00:43:35.446
A couple of days ago,
um, I might have accidentally


647
00:43:35.679 --> 00:43:38.051
on purpose
said a lot of the shit


648
00:43:38.285 --> 00:43:40.155
that was in that book, right?

649
00:43:40.924 --> 00:43:44.063
Look, I said that shit out loud.

650
00:43:45.432 --> 00:43:50.910
Jessica... whatever is in here

651
00:43:51.144 --> 00:43:53.081
could really, really
help us out.


652
00:43:55.085 --> 00:44:00.496
Peter's father was very, very,
very much into this.


653
00:44:00.730 --> 00:44:04.670
And Peter's father was very,
very, very rich.


654
00:44:04.905 --> 00:44:07.109
I think the reason
they're so rich


655
00:44:07.343 --> 00:44:09.347
is still in this house now.

656
00:44:11.384 --> 00:44:12.854
You're welcome.

657
00:44:18.431 --> 00:44:19.500
I'm sorry.

658
00:44:30.656 --> 00:44:33.295
Hey, sweetie. Come to mommy.

659
00:44:33.528 --> 00:44:36.100
(Baby cooing)

660
00:44:36.334 --> 00:44:38.906
Oh no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no.


661
00:44:40.576 --> 00:44:41.812
(Jess grunts)

662
00:44:42.046 --> 00:44:43.248
Damn it, Jess.

663
00:44:48.525 --> 00:44:50.329
I guess we're really
doing this, huh.


664
00:44:51.899 --> 00:44:52.900
So is that it?

665
00:44:53.068 --> 00:44:55.150
There's not like the smell
of brimstone or something?


666
00:44:57.009 --> 00:44:58.913
The last step.

667
00:45:00.582 --> 00:45:02.286
Okay.

668
00:45:12.539 --> 00:45:15.445
(Cellphone vibrating)

669
00:45:20.757 --> 00:45:21.758
(Grunts)

670
00:45:29.941 --> 00:45:34.785
( Ppppj)

671
00:45:45.305 --> 00:45:48.411
Jess: I mean, he can't
just pull out, can he?


672
00:45:48.645 --> 00:45:50.148
What are we gonna do?

673
00:45:50.382 --> 00:45:51.383
Yeah, he can.

674
00:45:56.661 --> 00:45:58.131
I was uh, I was gonna pay myself

675
00:45:58.364 --> 00:45:59.835
after the investment came in.

676
00:46:01.972 --> 00:46:05.378
The Grant will be good
for business expenses...


677
00:46:06.447 --> 00:46:07.683
But not our bills.

678
00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:10.589
I'm scared, Brad.

679
00:46:13.128 --> 00:46:14.230
Yeah, me too.

680
00:46:16.835 --> 00:46:18.171
Let's try to get some sleep.

681
00:46:19.607 --> 00:46:21.677
I'll wake up in the morning,
I'll make some calls.


682
00:46:21.912 --> 00:46:23.749
And hopefully,
I can find somebody...


683
00:46:24.951 --> 00:46:26.220
To replace Vincent's money.

684
00:46:26.454 --> 00:46:27.556
Okay.

685
00:46:30.061 --> 00:46:31.799
Oh, boy.

686
00:46:39.146 --> 00:46:40.147
No, no.

687
00:46:40.215 --> 00:46:42.653
It's... it's no problem.
I appreciate it.


688
00:46:42.887 --> 00:46:43.888
Okay, thank you.

689
00:46:43.956 --> 00:46:46.427
(Brad clears throat)

690
00:46:46.661 --> 00:46:48.398
- And?
- Oh, nope.


691
00:46:48.631 --> 00:46:50.468
Oh shit.

692
00:46:50.702 --> 00:46:52.081
Is there anyone
you haven't thought of?


693
00:46:52.105 --> 00:46:53.408
Uh, I thought he said

694
00:46:53.641 --> 00:46:56.314
he was gonna fix
that goddamn door!


695
00:46:57.249 --> 00:47:00.021
Who the hell do we know
that has that much money?


696
00:47:01.657 --> 00:47:02.861
I know who.

697
00:47:07.871 --> 00:47:10.308
Babe, no, there's no way.

698
00:47:10.542 --> 00:47:11.812
Yeah, I'ii—— I'll call him.

699
00:47:12.045 --> 00:47:14.116
I'll invite him over for dinner.
He's our hail Mary.


700
00:47:14.350 --> 00:47:15.786
Okay, all right fine.

701
00:47:16.989 --> 00:47:17.656
Trust me on this.

702
00:47:17.891 --> 00:47:19.426
Go for it.

703
00:47:19.660 --> 00:47:21.932
Okay, yeah.

704
00:47:26.107 --> 00:47:28.144
This is so weird.

705
00:47:42.941 --> 00:47:45.846
(Taking deep breaths)

706
00:47:57.402 --> 00:48:02.346
( Ppppj)

707
00:48:07.589 --> 00:48:09.426
(Choking)

708
00:48:17.109 --> 00:48:20.015
(Panting)

709
00:48:24.791 --> 00:48:25.792
Brad: Baby, what's wrong?

710
00:48:25.826 --> 00:48:28.398
(Sobbing)

711
00:48:28.631 --> 00:48:30.836
What's going on?

712
00:48:33.541 --> 00:48:35.278
What happened? 
What's going on?

713
00:48:35.512 --> 00:48:36.848
What the fuck.

714
00:48:37.082 --> 00:48:38.684
Sorry, baby, I can't.

715
00:48:38.919 --> 00:48:39.653
What happened?

716
00:48:39.888 --> 00:48:42.359
Come, come, come on here.
Come on here.


717
00:48:42.592 --> 00:48:43.962
Okay.

718
00:48:44.196 --> 00:48:46.467
Oh, my god.

719
00:48:46.700 --> 00:48:48.939
Sit, hang in there.
Keep breathing.


720
00:48:49.173 --> 00:48:50.174
Let me see.

721
00:48:52.446 --> 00:48:53.982
It was him.

722
00:48:54.216 --> 00:48:57.389
(Sobbing)

723
00:48:58.992 --> 00:49:00.161
Okay.

724
00:49:01.430 --> 00:49:02.199
Okay.

725
00:49:02.432 --> 00:49:03.836
Okay, apply pressure.

726
00:49:08.578 --> 00:49:09.747
Damn it.

727
00:49:11.517 --> 00:49:13.822
Okay. Okay, all right.

728
00:49:16.260 --> 00:49:17.662
I got this.

729
00:49:17.897 --> 00:49:19.166
It's gonna be okay.

730
00:49:19.399 --> 00:49:22.773
Let me just handle this meal
and I'll be right up.


731
00:49:23.007 --> 00:49:24.820
Are you... are you okay
to be here by yourself?


732
00:49:24.844 --> 00:49:25.845
Yeah, I'm okay.

733
00:49:25.913 --> 00:49:27.649
Okay, stay here.

734
00:49:27.884 --> 00:49:29.353
I'ma deal with this. I love you.

735
00:49:29.586 --> 00:49:30.587
I love you, too.

736
00:49:30.688 --> 00:49:32.760
We're gonna... we're gonna
figure this out, okay?


737
00:49:32.994 --> 00:49:34.831
- Hurry though.
- Okay.


738
00:49:35.064 --> 00:49:37.202
I got this, sweetie. All right?

739
00:49:37.435 --> 00:49:38.704
Apply pressure.

740
00:49:42.245 --> 00:49:44.049
There he is. Come on in.

741
00:49:44.283 --> 00:49:45.284
Thanks for the invite.

742
00:49:45.318 --> 00:49:46.922
Brad: All right, man.

743
00:49:47.155 --> 00:49:49.026
Right this way.

744
00:49:49.259 --> 00:49:50.395
I like that jacket.

745
00:49:53.969 --> 00:49:57.142
Well, Brad, I got to tell you
that was pretty good.


746
00:49:57.375 --> 00:49:58.779
Oh yeah.

747
00:49:59.012 --> 00:50:00.224
Jess is no slouch
in the kitchen.


748
00:50:00.248 --> 00:50:01.785
No, she sure isn't.

749
00:50:02.018 --> 00:50:03.521
Yeah, she apologizes.

750
00:50:03.755 --> 00:50:05.116
Just for not being able
to make it.


751
00:50:05.191 --> 00:50:06.871
- She's not feeling well, so...
- Oh, well.


752
00:50:06.895 --> 00:50:08.656
You know, we can just have
a little man chat.


753
00:50:08.765 --> 00:50:10.201
Yeah, yeah. So, so...

754
00:50:10.435 --> 00:50:11.570
Listen, thanks again for...

755
00:50:11.805 --> 00:50:13.374
For just making
this place available.


756
00:50:13.608 --> 00:50:15.178
It really came
at a perfect time.


757
00:50:15.411 --> 00:50:17.525
It's awful lonely around here
with ain't nobody in it.


758
00:50:17.549 --> 00:50:18.050
Oh, I can...

759
00:50:18.284 --> 00:50:21.156
(Indistinct chattering)

760
00:50:24.062 --> 00:50:25.698
I had mentioned before.

761
00:50:25.933 --> 00:50:28.872
Jess and I, we're...
We're starting this business.


762
00:50:29.106 --> 00:50:30.375
It's called a "brew pub".

763
00:50:30.608 --> 00:50:34.951
And it's a combination
of brewery and restaurant.


764
00:50:35.184 --> 00:50:39.192
And we found a beautiful place,
a beautiful space.


765
00:50:39.426 --> 00:50:41.898
It's this church.
I think it's on 5th.


766
00:50:42.132 --> 00:50:43.401
First presbyterian.

767
00:50:43.634 --> 00:50:44.780
Yeah, I know exactly
where that is.


768
00:50:44.804 --> 00:50:48.277
And we thought that,
you know, given its location...


769
00:50:48.511 --> 00:50:51.383
(Indistinct chattering)

770
00:50:53.688 --> 00:50:54.791
The plan is to... to-

771
00:50:55.024 --> 00:50:56.995
to rent out
the rest of the space


772
00:50:57.228 --> 00:50:58.431
uh, to shops,

773
00:50:58.664 --> 00:51:01.838
because it's downtown,
people can come and go, and uh...


774
00:51:02.072 --> 00:51:03.283
I don't understand
why you're telling me all this.


775
00:51:03.307 --> 00:51:05.178
Here's the thing.

776
00:51:05.411 --> 00:51:07.783
You seem like
you would be a perfect partner.


777
00:51:08.017 --> 00:51:09.419
I want to give you
this opportunity.


778
00:51:09.653 --> 00:51:10.355
- (Peter laughs)
- Hear me out.


779
00:51:10.588 --> 00:51:11.123
Peter:
I got plenty of money, Brad.


780
00:51:11.357 --> 00:51:13.060
20%, all right?

781
00:51:13.294 --> 00:51:15.531
We... we... we need the kind of
person, not just anyone,


782
00:51:15.766 --> 00:51:18.204
someone that is connected
to the community. Someone who...


783
00:51:18.437 --> 00:51:20.551
So you invited me to dinner
to give me a business pitch.


784
00:51:20.575 --> 00:51:21.343
- Is that it?
- I just...


785
00:51:21.577 --> 00:51:22.847
No, I... because of...

786
00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:24.201
For the good company, but...

787
00:51:24.416 --> 00:51:25.858
- But this is an opportunity.
- Yeah.


788
00:51:25.886 --> 00:51:27.766
Do you know what I'm saying?
Wait, what's going on?


789
00:51:27.790 --> 00:51:29.326
It might be an opportunity
for you.


790
00:51:29.559 --> 00:51:31.296
But it ain't
my kind of opportunity.


791
00:51:31.530 --> 00:51:33.735
I like having you around here.

792
00:51:33.969 --> 00:51:34.970
I like being around here.

793
00:51:35.104 --> 00:51:36.817
I thought you were
a different kind of guy, man.


794
00:51:36.841 --> 00:51:37.609
All right, all right, listen.

795
00:51:37.843 --> 00:51:39.155
You ain't nothing,
but a fucking, lousy,


796
00:51:39.179 --> 00:51:40.457
- stinking salesman.
- (Overlapping speech)


797
00:51:40.481 --> 00:51:42.185
- Man, fuck you.
- Oh.


798
00:51:42.419 --> 00:51:44.189
And you and your woman
pack your shit.


799
00:51:44.423 --> 00:51:45.793
- This...
- Get out!


800
00:51:46.026 --> 00:51:46.761
- You're not...
- Get the fuck out of my house.


801
00:51:46.995 --> 00:51:47.996
You're not serious.

802
00:51:49.633 --> 00:51:51.771
Wait, wait. Peter.

803
00:51:52.005 --> 00:51:53.674
Hey, Peter.

804
00:51:53.909 --> 00:51:54.342
Peter, you can't be serious.

805
00:51:54.576 --> 00:51:55.779
Fuck you, Brad.

806
00:51:56.013 --> 00:51:56.513
Brad: Come on, now.

807
00:51:56.748 --> 00:51:57.382
You can't kick us out.

808
00:51:57.615 --> 00:51:58.616
You want to bet?

809
00:51:58.819 --> 00:51:59.854
Brad: Peter, please.

810
00:52:00.087 --> 00:52:01.499
My goddamn house,
I'll do what I please.


811
00:52:01.523 --> 00:52:03.227
Brad:
Peter, please don't kick us out.


812
00:52:03.461 --> 00:52:04.943
What the fuck is wrong
with this door?


813
00:52:04.997 --> 00:52:06.400
Peter, you're not
gonna kick us out.


814
00:52:06.633 --> 00:52:08.046
- Peter: It's my goddamn house.
- Peter.


815
00:52:08.070 --> 00:52:09.582
Peter: I can't even
get my goddamn door...


816
00:52:09.606 --> 00:52:10.274
Peter, you can't kick us...

817
00:52:10.508 --> 00:52:11.509
Peter: Yes, I can.

818
00:52:11.610 --> 00:52:12.712
You can't kick us out.

819
00:52:14.851 --> 00:52:20.228
( Ppppj)

820
00:52:32.318 --> 00:52:35.826
(Brad grunts)

821
00:52:40.001 --> 00:52:41.804
Jess: Brad, what's going on?

822
00:52:42.038 --> 00:52:43.039
(Jess gasps)

823
00:52:43.207 --> 00:52:44.676
What the fuck did you do?

824
00:52:44.911 --> 00:52:46.613
He was going to evict us.

825
00:52:46.848 --> 00:52:47.849
I had no choice,

826
00:52:47.983 --> 00:52:50.321
so go get me something
to tie him up.


827
00:52:51.724 --> 00:52:52.960
No, we're not doing this.

828
00:52:55.231 --> 00:52:56.233
What have you done?

829
00:52:56.466 --> 00:52:57.937
Go get me something
to tie him up.


830
00:53:06.620 --> 00:53:07.698
- (Grunting)
- I'm not playing.


831
00:53:07.723 --> 00:53:09.860
Go get me something
to tie him up.


832
00:53:12.098 --> 00:53:13.735
(Coughing)

833
00:53:13.969 --> 00:53:15.071
Stop moving.

834
00:53:17.175 --> 00:53:18.210
Stop moving.

835
00:53:20.481 --> 00:53:21.851
I said stop.

836
00:53:36.413 --> 00:53:38.317
(Peter grunts, coughs)

837
00:53:40.254 --> 00:53:45.131
( Ppppj)

838
00:53:46.901 --> 00:53:48.972
Peter.

839
00:53:49.205 --> 00:53:49.974
I need that money

840
00:53:50.207 --> 00:53:52.512
and you're going
to give it to me.


841
00:53:52.746 --> 00:53:54.349
$200,000.

842
00:53:57.288 --> 00:53:58.609
I need you to sign in
to the bank,


843
00:53:58.825 --> 00:54:01.831
so that they can make
the transfer.


844
00:54:02.065 --> 00:54:03.267
Okay.

845
00:54:04.602 --> 00:54:05.906
(Sighs)

846
00:54:06.139 --> 00:54:09.479
And once it goes through,
you can go home.


847
00:54:09.713 --> 00:54:13.520
You'll own 20%
and you'll be a happy investor.


848
00:54:13.755 --> 00:54:15.534
It will take a couple of days
for the money to go through,


849
00:54:15.558 --> 00:54:18.664
but then we'll all be good.

850
00:54:18.898 --> 00:54:20.067
Good man.

851
00:54:37.401 --> 00:54:42.478
( Ppppj)

852
00:55:02.753 --> 00:55:04.255
I knew you had it in you.

853
00:55:27.903 --> 00:55:28.370
Babe, a transfer like that...

854
00:55:28.604 --> 00:55:30.174
I have an idea.

855
00:55:38.257 --> 00:55:41.162
(Chanting spell)

856
00:55:53.387 --> 00:55:56.293
(Loud thudding)

857
00:56:17.034 --> 00:56:19.907
(Loud thudding)

858
00:56:33.567 --> 00:56:34.837
(Peter grunting)

859
00:56:55.477 --> 00:56:56.847
There isn't a way out of it,
Jess.


860
00:56:58.050 --> 00:56:59.531
Well, then, what do you
want me to do?


861
00:56:59.720 --> 00:57:01.189
He's trying to kill Peter.

862
00:57:01.423 --> 00:57:02.124
Why?

863
00:57:02.358 --> 00:57:03.126
How does that help him?

864
00:57:03.360 --> 00:57:04.495
I don't know.

865
00:57:06.599 --> 00:57:07.969
We have to do something.

866
00:57:09.005 --> 00:57:10.207
(Jess sighs)

867
00:57:14.783 --> 00:57:16.252
I feel sick to my stomach.

868
00:57:19.058 --> 00:57:20.627
Yeah, me too.

869
00:57:22.131 --> 00:57:23.600
It's exhaustion.

870
00:57:28.376 --> 00:57:29.377
Come here.

871
00:57:42.138 --> 00:57:46.914
( Ppppj)

872
00:58:04.448 --> 00:58:06.219
Holy shit.

873
00:58:10.561 --> 00:58:12.043
Oh easy, easy.
Don't move, don't move.


874
00:58:12.097 --> 00:58:12.732
What's happening?

875
00:58:12.966 --> 00:58:14.047
Everything's gonna be okay.

876
00:58:14.202 --> 00:58:16.272
Wait, wait right there, baby.

877
00:58:18.476 --> 00:58:19.245
- Wait a minute.
- Oh, my god.


878
00:58:19.478 --> 00:58:20.479
- It's okay.
- Oh, my god.


879
00:58:20.681 --> 00:58:22.518
Okay, take your time.
Take your time.


880
00:58:22.752 --> 00:58:24.331
- Oh, my god.
- Let's get to the bathroom.


881
00:58:24.355 --> 00:58:26.037
- Oh, my god.
- Everything's gonna be fine.


882
00:58:26.125 --> 00:58:27.470
- That's okay, come on.
- What's going on?


883
00:58:27.494 --> 00:58:29.074
Everything's gonna be fine.
Let's go this way.


884
00:58:29.098 --> 00:58:30.868
- Ow.
- Okay, easy, go slow.


885
00:58:31.102 --> 00:58:32.147
Everything's gonna be fine,
baby.


886
00:58:32.171 --> 00:58:33.440
It's okay.

887
00:58:33.673 --> 00:58:34.674
Okay.

888
00:58:34.810 --> 00:58:35.577
Okay, I'm gonna
pull it up now, okay?


889
00:58:35.812 --> 00:58:36.479
Okay.

890
00:58:36.713 --> 00:58:37.825
I'm gonna pull it up
nice and slow.


891
00:58:37.849 --> 00:58:38.617
Okay.

892
00:58:38.851 --> 00:58:40.452
Nice and slow.
Just keep breathing, okay?


893
00:58:40.520 --> 00:58:41.957
- Oh.
- What is it?


894
00:58:42.191 --> 00:58:43.928
Okay, right, just let me
lift up the shirt.


895
00:58:44.161 --> 00:58:45.402
Keep breathing. 
Keep breathing.

896
00:58:45.430 --> 00:58:45.999
(Taking deep breaths)

897
00:58:46.232 --> 00:58:48.871
Okay, here we go. There we go.

898
00:58:49.105 --> 00:58:52.244
There we go. There we go.

899
00:58:52.478 --> 00:58:54.040
Okay, we're gonna
get you in the shower.


900
00:58:54.181 --> 00:58:56.586
You're gonna be fine, baby.
You're gonna be fine.


901
00:58:56.820 --> 00:58:57.821
Yeah, get in the shower.

902
00:58:57.922 --> 00:58:59.443
All right, now, back up,
nice and slow.


903
00:58:59.492 --> 00:59:00.060
Jess: Okay.

904
00:59:00.294 --> 00:59:01.396
You all right?

905
00:59:01.629 --> 00:59:03.133
All right, nice and slow. Okay?

906
00:59:03.366 --> 00:59:04.567
Now you just let the water on.

907
00:59:04.635 --> 00:59:05.680
There you go, nice and slow.

908
00:59:05.704 --> 00:59:07.341
- Help me.
- Okay.


909
00:59:07.574 --> 00:59:08.619
I'll be right back.
I'm gonna go get some towels.


910
00:59:08.643 --> 00:59:09.412
Jess:

911
00:59:09.645 --> 00:59:12.518

(Sighs)

01:00:22.157 --> 01:00:23.460
(Gasps)

916

( Ppppj)

917
01:01:00.066 --> 01:01:01.469
You don't have to do this,
you know.


918
01:01:01.702 --> 01:01:03.039
Like too much.

919
01:01:03.273 --> 01:01:04.843
I ain't gonna say nothin'
to nobody.


920
01:01:07.581 --> 01:01:08.903
Listen,
you don't have to do this.


921
01:01:09.051 --> 01:01:10.487
I tried to talk to him.

922
01:01:13.894 --> 01:01:15.798
I have to do it.
I do have to do this.


923
01:01:16.032 --> 01:01:16.767
I'll tell you one thing.

924
01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.538
You're gonna need
a lot bigger knife.


925
01:01:19.773 --> 01:01:21.743
I shouldn't have to do that.

926
01:01:21.977 --> 01:01:24.148
(Indistinct speech)

927
01:01:24.381 --> 01:01:26.652
Peter: That little goddamn
thing ain't gonna do nothing.


928
01:01:28.156 --> 01:01:29.826
You better go for the throat.

929
01:01:30.060 --> 01:01:31.621
Because if I survive,
you're gonna be...


930
01:01:31.662 --> 01:01:33.734
Have to look over your shoulder.

931
01:01:35.270 --> 01:01:38.076
(Taking deep breaths)

932
01:01:46.392 --> 01:01:49.031
Brad's father: Do it. Attaboy.

933
01:01:49.264 --> 01:01:50.000
I said, do it.

934
01:01:50.233 --> 01:01:51.578
What the hell
were you thinking, huh?


935
01:01:51.602 --> 01:01:52.603
Huh?

936
01:01:52.704 --> 01:01:54.575
You know we can't afford
a goddamn dog.


937
01:01:54.809 --> 01:01:57.011
Hell, we can barely afford
to keep your little punk ass.


938
01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:02.391
A man takes responsibility
for his actions.


939
01:02:02.624 --> 01:02:03.894
You hear me?

940
01:02:04.128 --> 01:02:06.532
You brought this bitch home.

941
01:02:06.767 --> 01:02:07.935
So do it.

942
01:02:10.073 --> 01:02:11.609
Pick it up.

943
01:02:11.843 --> 01:02:13.179
Hurry the fuck up.

944
01:02:14.883 --> 01:02:16.052
Stupid little boy.

945
01:02:21.362 --> 01:02:23.433
What... what you waiting for,
huh?


946
01:02:23.666 --> 01:02:25.403
Do it, Brad!

947
01:02:25.637 --> 01:02:27.040
Hell is wrong with you?

948
01:02:27.274 --> 01:02:28.911
Give me that damn thing.

949
01:02:29.144 --> 01:02:30.848
I'll do it my goddamn self, boy.

950
01:02:33.653 --> 01:02:35.123
Fucking dog.

951
01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:39.164
This is all
your fucking fault, Brad.


952
01:02:43.172 --> 01:02:48.282

Jess: Brad, Brad, open the door.

957
01:03:28.563 --> 01:03:29.805
Brad, right now. 
Open the door.

958
01:03:30.033 --> 01:03:31.034
You can't do this.

959
01:03:31.135 --> 01:03:32.304
Open the door, Brad.

960
01:03:32.537 --> 01:03:33.974
Brad: You saw the book, Jess.

961
01:03:34.208 --> 01:03:35.911
It's you or him.

962
01:03:36.145 --> 01:03:36.746
I have to do this.

963
01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:39.718
- Open the fucking door.
- Get me...


964
01:03:39.953 --> 01:03:41.790
Come on, Brad, open the door,
Brad.


965
01:03:42.023 --> 01:03:43.526
Shut up!

966
01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:44.996

(Banging on door)

01:03:49.171 --> 01:03:51.977
Jess: Come on, let me in!

969
01:03:56.987 --> 01:03:58.957
Open the door, Brad.

970
01:03:59.191 --> 01:04:01.528
You have to stop now.

971
01:04:01.763 --> 01:04:02.330
Stop now.

972
01:04:02.564 --> 01:04:04.301

01:04:09.678 --> 01:04:12.250
Brad, no, Brad.

975
01:04:12.484 --> 01:04:14.655
Don't do it. Come on.

976
01:04:14.889 --> 01:04:16.760
Please, Brad.

977
01:04:16.993 --> 01:04:18.797
You don't have to fucking
do this.


978
01:04:24.041 --> 01:04:28.582
( Ppppj)

979
01:04:32.057 --> 01:04:34.194
(Brad grunts)

980
01:04:35.463 --> 01:04:38.369
(Taking deep breaths)

981
01:04:46.652 --> 01:04:49.224
(Grunts)

982
01:04:52.464 --> 01:04:54.334
Ah!

983
01:05:13.539 --> 01:05:16.445
(Jess sobs)

984
01:05:31.608 --> 01:05:36.685
( Ppppj)

985
01:06:38.142 --> 01:06:40.914
(Grunting)

986
01:06:54.474 --> 01:06:59.618
( Ppppj)

987
01:07:58.302 --> 01:08:01.241
(Loud thudding)

988
01:08:09.959 --> 01:08:10.960
What is that?

989
01:08:11.027 --> 01:08:12.663
It's still fucking...

990
01:08:12.898 --> 01:08:14.501
What more do you want?

991
01:08:24.020 --> 01:08:26.926
(Taking deep breaths)

992
01:08:34.073 --> 01:08:36.779
(Rattling)

993
01:08:37.013 --> 01:08:38.750
(Grunting)

994
01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:07.206
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
- What? What?


995
01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:08.977
I don't think that's Peter.

996
01:09:20.633 --> 01:09:21.634
Brad: (Indistinct speech)

997
01:09:21.769 --> 01:09:22.930
- Grab his feet.
- Jess: What?


998
01:09:26.478 --> 01:09:27.981
We could destroy the body.

999
01:09:30.185 --> 01:09:34.427
Cut off his head, burn it.
Right?


1000
01:09:34.661 --> 01:09:36.264
Brad, no.

1001
01:09:37.433 --> 01:09:39.270
Well, then what are we
supposed to do, Jess?


1002
01:09:43.278 --> 01:09:45.482
I can't...
I can't do this anymore.


1003
01:09:45.716 --> 01:09:47.320
Uh, I don't know, I'm sorry.

1004
01:09:48.756 --> 01:09:49.992
(Door closed)

1005
01:09:52.196 --> 01:09:53.632
Son of a bitch.

1006
01:09:57.841 --> 01:10:00.747
(Mammon laughing)

1007
01:10:13.538 --> 01:10:14.273
Hey handsome.

1008
01:10:14.507 --> 01:10:17.113
(Laughing)

1009
01:10:18.548 --> 01:10:19.728
You can't get out of this house.

1010
01:10:19.752 --> 01:10:20.954
Fuck you.

1011
01:10:21.187 --> 01:10:22.456
You don't know me.

1012
01:10:22.690 --> 01:10:25.897
(Laughing)

1013
01:10:30.639 --> 01:10:32.043
You know what?

1014
01:10:32.276 --> 01:10:33.746
The clock is ticking.

1015
01:10:35.850 --> 01:10:37.086
Time for you to worship me.

1016
01:10:37.319 --> 01:10:38.689
Get down there, goddamn it.

1017
01:10:38.923 --> 01:10:42.964
Get on your goddamn knees
and worship me.


1018
01:10:51.214 --> 01:10:52.650
There you go, Brad.

1019
01:10:52.884 --> 01:10:54.454
Good man.

1020
01:11:13.425 --> 01:11:18.803
( Ppppj)

1021
01:11:26.952 --> 01:11:30.425
Whatever you want,
it's yours now.


1022
01:11:38.475 --> 01:11:39.476
What's that?

1023
01:11:42.550 --> 01:11:43.853
This is our future.

1024
01:11:46.257 --> 01:11:47.894
Here, here.

1025
01:11:48.128 --> 01:11:49.129
Oh, my god.

1026
01:11:50.666 --> 01:11:51.267
Jess: How much is that?

1027
01:11:51.501 --> 01:11:54.808
It's uh, $50,000.

1028
01:11:55.910 --> 01:11:57.848
$10,000 each.

1029
01:11:58.081 --> 01:11:59.684
Where the hell
did you get that from?


1030
01:11:59.918 --> 01:12:03.325
Um, him. Yeah.

1031
01:12:03.558 --> 01:12:07.566
It uh... it was gold.
A lot of it.


1032
01:12:07.801 --> 01:12:10.672
And I had to go
to a few different pawn shops


1033
01:12:10.907 --> 01:12:12.243
just to get rid of it, but...

1034
01:12:14.513 --> 01:12:16.117
He just gave that to you?

1035
01:12:17.988 --> 01:12:19.223
There was a price.

1036
01:12:21.060 --> 01:12:21.829
What's the price?

1037
01:12:22.062 --> 01:12:23.198
Brad: He um...

1038
01:12:24.567 --> 01:12:27.106
Jess, he guaranteed us success.

1039
01:12:28.876 --> 01:12:31.514
He said the business
would flourish and...


1040
01:12:33.318 --> 01:12:35.389
He said we could...
We could have a family.


1041
01:12:35.622 --> 01:12:37.794
(Sighs)

1042
01:12:38.028 --> 01:12:39.497
What is the goddamn price?

1043
01:12:39.731 --> 01:12:40.932
- He said... he said...
- Brad.


1044
01:12:41.034 --> 01:12:42.369
We could have a family.

1045
01:12:45.075 --> 01:12:46.076
What's the price?

1046
01:12:46.244 --> 01:12:47.881
Loyahy.

1047
01:12:48.114 --> 01:12:50.419
- Oh, my god.
- I'm fine. I'm fine.


1048
01:12:50.652 --> 01:12:51.774
I'm fine. I'm gonna be fine.

1049
01:12:51.956 --> 01:12:53.358
This is... look...

1050
01:12:55.462 --> 01:12:58.535
He... he wants us to
open up this business.


1051
01:12:58.769 --> 01:13:01.040
He wants us to, so—-

1052
01:13:01.274 --> 01:13:03.178
I mean, I don't know why,
but he said,


1053
01:13:03.411 --> 01:13:05.682
once we get it up and running...

1054
01:13:07.553 --> 01:13:09.657
You know, then he'd take...
Leave us alone, so.


1055
01:13:11.094 --> 01:13:12.663
And you trust him?

1056
01:13:17.006 --> 01:13:18.408
(Chuckles)

1057
01:13:23.284 --> 01:13:24.755
This is $50,000.

1058
01:13:24.988 --> 01:13:26.224
(Sighs)

1059
01:13:32.603 --> 01:13:34.140
Jess: I don't like this.

1060
01:13:50.907 --> 01:13:52.218
Brad:
Yeah, I'm sorry, Mr. Vincent.


1061
01:13:52.242 --> 01:13:53.946
But unfortunately,
after you dropped out,


1062
01:13:54.180 --> 01:13:55.983
I had to move forward
with another investor


1063
01:13:56.217 --> 01:13:59.090
who immediately jumped in.

1064
01:13:59.323 --> 01:14:01.327
So I hope you...

1065
01:14:01.561 --> 01:14:03.131
No, no, no.

1066
01:14:03.364 --> 01:14:04.133
That's fine.

1067
01:14:04.366 --> 01:14:06.104
Uh, I tell you what,
I'll give you a call


1068
01:14:06.337 --> 01:14:08.541
if uh...
If I'm in need of anything else.


1069
01:14:10.412 --> 01:14:11.849
Definitely.

1070
01:14:12.082 --> 01:14:13.551
All right, man, appreciate it.

1071
01:14:15.388 --> 01:14:18.094
All right, so uh, with the Grant

1072
01:14:18.328 --> 01:14:22.102
and the uh... you know,
the other money uh,


1073
01:14:22.336 --> 01:14:24.774
we should be able to open up
a lot earlier than... than...


1074
01:14:25.008 --> 01:14:29.650
Than we expected,
so that's good, huh?


1075
01:14:30.786 --> 01:14:34.928
He hasn't said or done anything
since he took Peter's body.


1076
01:14:35.162 --> 01:14:36.597
I know, he's waiting.

1077
01:14:38.668 --> 01:14:41.040
This just all doesn't
seem worth it to me, Brad.


1078
01:14:41.274 --> 01:14:42.409
(Sighs)

1079
01:14:42.643 --> 01:14:44.013
I'm trying to fix this.

1080
01:14:46.017 --> 01:14:47.987
I'm trying to fix this
the best way I can.


1081
01:14:53.164 --> 01:14:54.333
I know.

1082
01:15:01.714 --> 01:15:03.618
I'm sorry, Jessica.

1083
01:15:05.655 --> 01:15:07.559
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry that I had to...


1084
01:15:09.263 --> 01:15:10.699
I'm sorry
I dragged you into this.


1085
01:15:10.933 --> 01:15:11.934
Hey.

1086
01:15:12.102 --> 01:15:14.139
You didn't have a choice.

1087
01:15:14.373 --> 01:15:15.475
I know that now.

1088
01:15:15.709 --> 01:15:18.448
Everything you've done,
you did for us.


1089
01:15:19.717 --> 01:15:21.279
We are past regrets
at this point, okay?


1090
01:15:21.454 --> 01:15:23.391
Okay.

1091
01:15:23.625 --> 01:15:24.326
I love you so much.

1092
01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:25.695
I love you, too.

1093
01:15:30.071 --> 01:15:33.077
(Regurgitates)

1094
01:15:48.107 --> 01:15:53.017
( Ppppj)

1095
01:16:23.111 --> 01:16:28.020
( Ppppj)

1096
01:16:58.114 --> 01:17:03.024
( Ppppj)

1097
01:17:14.079 --> 01:17:14.848
Come on. You can do it.

1098
01:17:15.081 --> 01:17:16.083
Oh, oh, thank you.

1099
01:17:16.317 --> 01:17:17.753
And there we go.

1100
01:17:19.323 --> 01:17:19.791
That was a good one.

1101
01:17:20.024 --> 01:17:21.060
We're gettin' better.

1102
01:17:21.293 --> 01:17:22.395
(Sighs)

1103
01:17:27.639 --> 01:17:28.640
What?

1104
01:17:28.775 --> 01:17:30.245
Nothing.

1105
01:17:30.478 --> 01:17:30.946
Jess, come on, now.

1106
01:17:31.180 --> 01:17:32.349
What?

1107
01:17:32.582 --> 01:17:34.520
It just all doesn't seem real.

1108
01:17:37.259 --> 01:17:39.181
So many doctors told me
I would never be able to,


1109
01:17:39.363 --> 01:17:41.333
but here we are.

1110
01:17:41.567 --> 01:17:42.737
Yup.

1111
01:17:42.970 --> 01:17:45.074
And I never thought
I'd be ready.


1112
01:17:49.751 --> 01:17:51.253
Where do you think he went?

1113
01:17:55.729 --> 01:17:56.965
Who knows?

1114
01:17:59.036 --> 01:18:00.381
Will the new house
be ready next week?


1115
01:18:00.405 --> 01:18:01.808
I certainly hope so.

1116
01:18:02.042 --> 01:18:04.246
I paid those contractors extra,

1117
01:18:04.479 --> 01:18:06.751
just to make sure
they'd be fast.


1118
01:18:06.985 --> 01:18:08.755
Keep your fingers crossed.

1119
01:18:08.989 --> 01:18:10.791
I can't wait to get out
of this fucking house.


1120
01:18:19.476 --> 01:18:22.082
So, I've been thinking
about names.


1121
01:18:23.919 --> 01:18:25.355
What do you think of Anna?

1122
01:18:27.425 --> 01:18:28.829
Anna.

1123
01:18:31.433 --> 01:18:32.602
I love it.

1124
01:18:32.837 --> 01:18:34.506
Jess: Oh babe, you do?

1125
01:18:34.741 --> 01:18:35.742
Her name's Anna.

1126
01:18:36.811 --> 01:18:38.347
(Laughs)

1127
01:18:43.691 --> 01:18:46.163
- Brad.
- Brad: Yeah, baby?


1128
01:18:46.397 --> 01:18:49.036
- Brad.
- Brad: What?


1129
01:18:49.269 --> 01:18:50.538
(Sobs) Brad.

1130
01:18:50.773 --> 01:18:52.242
Brad: What's going on?

1131
01:18:54.279 --> 01:18:57.185
(Takes deep breath)

1132
01:19:02.495 --> 01:19:03.865
Jess: What is that?

1133
01:19:06.136 --> 01:19:09.176
(Jess sobs)

1134
01:19:27.245 --> 01:19:28.280
What is it?

1135
01:19:30.284 --> 01:19:31.955
He uh, didn't Mark you.

1136
01:19:35.061 --> 01:19:36.263
He marked the baby.

1137
01:19:38.869 --> 01:19:40.471

(Grunts)

1142
01:19:54.901 --> 01:19:58.641
You have to get out with Anna.

1143
01:19:58.875 --> 01:20:00.411
Say it.

1144

Okay.

Now, I'm gonna do what I can.

Don't leave me. 
Please, don't.

Don't leave me. Please.

1150
01:20:14.974 --> 01:20:16.310
You have to get out.

1151
01:20:18.849 --> 01:20:21.086
Call the police and get out.

1152
01:20:22.155 --> 01:20:23.557
Okay, I love you.

1153
01:20:23.792 --> 01:20:25.461
I love you, too.

(Panting)

1160
01:21:50.564 --> 01:21:51.633
Come on.

1161
01:21:51.868 --> 01:21:53.237
Come on.

1162
01:22:18.087 --> 01:22:20.959
That's my knife, Brad.

1163
01:22:21.193 --> 01:22:23.397
Brad: Ah!

1164

(Brad grunting)

1165

Fuck you.

1167
01:22:32.983 --> 01:22:34.419
You'll never find her.

1168
01:22:34.652 --> 01:22:36.523
Jess called the police, too.

1169

(Indistinct speech)

1170
01:22:39.830 --> 01:22:40.899
She did, huh?

1171
01:22:44.005 --> 01:22:48.380
Well, I guess that kind of
wraps things up, doesn't it?


1172
01:22:57.532 --> 01:22:59.737
You want to know
something really funny?


1173
01:22:59.970 --> 01:23:04.012
For the first time in my life
I got nothing else to say.

Hey, Jess.

1180
01:24:08.206 --> 01:24:09.977
You can't do this. Please.

1181
01:24:10.210 --> 01:24:12.214
Oh yes, I can.

1182
01:24:12.448 --> 01:24:13.617
Please, no.

Where's my baby?

1188

Where's my baby? (Sobbing)

1189
01:25:34.579 --> 01:25:38.053
My baby. No, where's my baby?

1190
01:25:38.286 --> 01:25:39.857
Get off of me.

1191
01:25:40.090 --> 01:25:42.294
My baby.

1192
01:25:45.100 --> 01:25:47.538
No, no!

1193
01:25:50.711 --> 01:25:52.414
My baby.
