1
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.727
I'm Taylor Fisher and I'm a bitch.

2
00:00:14.104 --> 00:00:19.192
Beauty, intelligence, talent,
charisma, Hoobastank.


3
00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:21.278
What? They're good.

4
00:00:22.404 --> 00:00:24.072
Indie rock trends do move fast.

5
00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:26.116
Today, my alarm is set
to the Drunges.


6
00:00:28.785 --> 00:00:30.745
But by the time
you actually watch this...


7
00:00:30.912 --> 00:00:33.707
...they'll be headlining a toilet
in Toledo with mops.


8
00:00:33.873 --> 00:00:35.458
Hey, bitch, that's not cool.

9
00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.210
Eat cock!

10
00:00:42.507 --> 00:00:45.385
<i>Hello, Taylor.
It's Don. Don Waters, again</i>


11
00:00:45.552 --> 00:00:48.388
<i>We made out behind the Pizza Pitt.
You tasted the deep dish.</i>


12
00:00:48.555 --> 00:00:50.390
Not deep enough.

13
00:00:51.308 --> 00:00:52.475
Get out of the bathroom.

14
00:00:52.642 --> 00:00:56.646
You're ruining my life, you **** ****
**** **** fucking Ecstasy baby!


15
00:00:56.813 --> 00:00:59.983
<i>- I'm peeing.
- Taylor, hi, Singe Gupta.</i>


16
00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:02.485
<i>I very much liked our calculus date
at Pizza Pitt.</i>


17
00:01:02.652 --> 00:01:07.032
Loser. Your parabolic graph was bent
and I only got a B.


18
00:01:08.491 --> 00:01:09.909
French toast?

19
00:01:10.076 --> 00:01:12.078
Mom, I'm on a no-bread diet.

20
00:01:12.287 --> 00:01:14.122
- Since when?
- Since now!


21
00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:17.292
Oh, I hate you! 
I hope you die!

22
00:01:19.002 --> 00:01:21.004
<i>Taylor, what we did at Pizza Pitt...</i>

23
00:01:21.171 --> 00:01:23.632
Word of advice,
there's always new toothpaste.


24
00:01:23.798 --> 00:01:26.009
Don't swallow. Spit.

25
00:01:32.015 --> 00:01:35.477
<i>Cinderhella ll: Beauty Scream opened
this week at the Galaxy Pines Mall.</i>


26
00:01:35.644 --> 00:01:38.813
If you're anyone who's anyone
in Grizzly Lake, you'll go see it.


27
00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:40.815
Moscow Hyatt is my idol.

28
00:01:40.982 --> 00:01:43.526
This brings me to something I call:

29
00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:47.864
Taylor Fisher's Guide
to Not Being a Total Reject.


30
00:01:48.031 --> 00:01:51.159
One, go see Cinderhella <i>ll</i>
on Friday night, loser.


31
00:01:51.326 --> 00:01:53.662
Taylor, honey, I'm leaving.
Hurry or we'll be late.


32
00:01:53.828 --> 00:01:56.039
Mom, I'm doing something important!

33
00:01:56.206 --> 00:01:57.957
You're a monster!

34
00:01:58.124 --> 00:01:59.209
I'll be in the car.

35
00:01:59.376 --> 00:02:01.544
Fuck a duck!

36
00:02:02.212 --> 00:02:04.881
Let me montage this
to speed things up.


37
00:02:32.742 --> 00:02:33.743
What now?

38
00:02:34.744 --> 00:02:36.246
<i>Love Pizza Pitt.</i>

39
00:02:36.413 --> 00:02:37.497
<i>Who are you?</i>

40
00:02:37.664 --> 00:02:39.582
<i>Your biggest fan.</i>

41
00:02:39.749 --> 00:02:40.834
<i>Rad.</i>

42
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.753
<i>Bitch, going to kill you.</i>

43
00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.755
- Okay.
- Okay...


44
00:02:45.922 --> 00:02:48.174
Stalkers are so 2011.

45
00:02:48.341 --> 00:02:51.261
Get out of my room, you paedophile!

46
00:03:03.148 --> 00:03:04.858
Where is she?

47
00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.277
The girl gets away with everything.

48
00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:27.464
Life sucks.

49
00:03:34.721 --> 00:03:38.600
Nice. That's just awesome.

50
00:03:40.268 --> 00:03:42.812
<i>I try to remember
I'm only the second-biggest loser...</i>


51
00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:44.314
<i>...to walk Grizzly Lake High.</i>

52
00:03:44.481 --> 00:03:48.735
First place goes to the drunk slut who
screwed the dead mascot in 1992.


53
00:03:51.488 --> 00:03:54.991
But the '90s are history. So am I.

54
00:04:12.967 --> 00:04:14.344
Oh, my God, I love this song.

55
00:04:17.347 --> 00:04:19.015
Shit!

56
00:04:22.352 --> 00:04:24.729
No, no, no, no.

57
00:04:27.816 --> 00:04:29.275
Shit.

58
00:04:32.779 --> 00:04:35.865
<i>This is the fifth sighting of
mysterious objects over Grizzly Lake.</i>


59
00:04:37.534 --> 00:04:40.745
<i>Authorities speculate an elaborate
hoax perpetuated by high-school...</i>


60
00:04:40.912 --> 00:04:44.040
Dad, I forgot the bus leaves early
on Wednesdays. Can you drive me?


61
00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:45.750
Sure, hon.

62
00:04:46.668 --> 00:04:49.504
Nope, still drunk.

63
00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:06.896
Yo, Heather Mills.

64
00:05:07.063 --> 00:05:10.483
You're robbing me?
I didn't even know Iceland had crime.


65
00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:12.861
Stop generalising. 
I stole this shirt.

66
00:05:13.027 --> 00:05:15.530
- And the leather shoes?
- Vegetarian?


67
00:05:15.697 --> 00:05:18.908
"Vegetarianism is the taproot
of humanitarianism." Tolstoy.


68
00:05:19.075 --> 00:05:21.411
Give me your iPod, salad eater.

69
00:05:23.913 --> 00:05:26.749
- It's a fucking shuffle.
- I make 6.55 an hour.


70
00:05:26.916 --> 00:05:29.419
Yeah. Thanks, anyway.

71
00:05:29.586 --> 00:05:31.671
I'm too old for this shit.

72
00:05:32.171 --> 00:05:35.258
It's not my fault majoring
in Inuit Literature and Hipster Rock...


73
00:05:35.425 --> 00:05:39.053
-...doesn't replenish your trust fund.
- I listen to Aerosmith.


74
00:06:21.846 --> 00:06:24.057
- Hey, Clapton.
- Hey, Clapton.


75
00:06:24.557 --> 00:06:26.976
- Hey.
- Go left.


76
00:06:27.727 --> 00:06:31.147
Where is Clapton Davis?

77
00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:48.998
Other way.

78
00:07:01.344 --> 00:07:04.263
Who gave Riley the permission
to have the hots for Clapton?


79
00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:07.141
Did falling off the ugly tree
knock a dream into her head?


80
00:07:07.517 --> 00:07:12.647
Why doom a win like Clapton Davis
to a life of missionary sex?


81
00:07:21.656 --> 00:07:22.949
Nice save, Truman.

82
00:07:23.116 --> 00:07:25.201
Think you can hook me up
with Alexis at prom?


83
00:07:25.368 --> 00:07:27.036
Yeah, no problem!

84
00:07:32.458 --> 00:07:35.545
This bear's been deceased
since the Nixon Administration...


85
00:07:35.712 --> 00:07:38.423
...yet exerts
an extraordinary magnetic field.


86
00:07:41.676 --> 00:07:45.555
Toshiba, you're either the smartest kid
in school or the weirdest.


87
00:07:45.722 --> 00:07:48.141
Mimi, wait. Wait, Mimi. No.

88
00:07:48.307 --> 00:07:50.268
I know it looks like
such a light-hearted...


89
00:07:50.435 --> 00:07:53.396
...feel-good comedy
being an expecting teenage mom.


90
00:07:53.563 --> 00:07:57.817
Let me tell you something. I've been
principal at this school for five years.


91
00:07:57.984 --> 00:08:00.737
Let me tell both of you something.

92
00:08:01.738 --> 00:08:05.450
Pregnant teenagers
are never funny. Ever.


93
00:08:06.492 --> 00:08:07.952
I'm not pregnant.

94
00:08:09.162 --> 00:08:10.204
Cut the carbs.

95
00:08:11.581 --> 00:08:12.915
<i>Attention, Grizzly Lake High.</i>

96
00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:16.335

97
00:08:16.502 --> 00:08:17.587

<i>Hey, Clapton.</i>

102
00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:39.901
lone, did you tell Billy about us?

103
00:08:40.985 --> 00:08:44.906
Clapton, the small guy always beats
the invincible killing machine.


104
00:08:45.073 --> 00:08:46.699
You're my Pat Morita.

105
00:08:46.866 --> 00:08:48.618
Isn't he dead?

106
00:08:49.118 --> 00:08:50.369
Duck.

Verge.

108
00:08:59.629 --> 00:09:01.589
Get a life, punk.

109
00:09:01.756 --> 00:09:03.299
This is ugly.

110
00:09:20.983 --> 00:09:23.778
Three o'clock. Parking lot.

111
00:09:23.945 --> 00:09:27.490
Winner wins lone. Loser wins...

112
00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:30.159
- lone?
- Shut up!


113
00:09:30.326 --> 00:09:34.956
Just make sure your dumb ass
is there, dumb-ass!


114
00:09:44.173 --> 00:09:47.301
Really, Clapton? If you're gonna get
your limbs ripped off...


115
00:09:47.468 --> 00:09:49.428
...find a more worthy charity
than lone.


116
00:09:49.679 --> 00:09:51.139
Lone likes Sting.

117
00:09:51.305 --> 00:09:54.475
Clapton Davis,
you are more concept than reality.


118
00:10:01.065 --> 00:10:04.193
<i>I just mean that it looks like
Clapton's gonna ask out lone...</i>


119
00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:07.780
...which makes about as much sense
as that stupid movie Torque.


120
00:10:07.947 --> 00:10:09.866
So, what do you think
about you and me?


121
00:10:10.032 --> 00:10:12.285
Have you even thought about prom?

122
00:10:12.451 --> 00:10:15.371
Hey, Sander. I saw your dad's dick
on Chatroulette last night.


123
00:10:15.538 --> 00:10:17.206
Yes, Sander, I'm a girl.

124
00:10:17.373 --> 00:10:20.126
Forget about genocide,
poverty and political corruption.


125
00:10:20.293 --> 00:10:22.962
What could possibly be on
my girl mind other than prom?


126
00:10:23.129 --> 00:10:24.547
Totally right, lone.

127
00:10:24.714 --> 00:10:28.384
- Sting is the Bruno Mars of 1992.
- You're so funny.


128
00:10:28.593 --> 00:10:31.721
- Why do you think I'd go with him?
- No reason.


129
00:10:32.096 --> 00:10:36.475
Have you ever noticed that
we have compatible facial features?


130
00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:41.397
Riley, don't delay the inevitable.

131
00:10:41.856 --> 00:10:44.400
You know in three days,
we're gonna be prom dates...


132
00:10:44.609 --> 00:10:46.819
...and the sex and shame
will be fleeting.


133
00:10:46.986 --> 00:10:48.529
Look, get off my nuts, all right?

134
00:10:49.071 --> 00:10:51.824
Hey, Riley, I don't wanna hear
about your testicles.


135
00:10:51.991 --> 00:10:54.493
The assignment is simple.
You're a smart girl.


136
00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:57.914
Use what you've learned this semester
about quantum physics...


137
00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:01.375
...and build me a time machine
so I can get out of here.


138
00:11:04.629 --> 00:11:07.757
- So hot.
- Sander, we have to finish this.


139
00:11:07.924 --> 00:11:09.717
Then stop messing
with that bear claw.


140
00:11:09.884 --> 00:11:11.719
I took it from the mascot. Strange.

141
00:11:11.886 --> 00:11:14.597
Someone wired this with organic,
super-conduction Mimis--


142
00:11:14.764 --> 00:11:16.766
- MagMimis-- Magnets.
- God.


143
00:11:16.933 --> 00:11:19.352
Come on.
Toshiba, I mean, look at Clapton's.


144
00:11:20.186 --> 00:11:23.731
It's got a clock-looking thing, okay?
I wanna pass this course.


145
00:11:23.898 --> 00:11:27.235
Then do something. If I fail science,
I'm stuck with you next year...


146
00:11:27.401 --> 00:11:29.528
...in the Remedial History
of the Jelly Bean.


147
00:11:29.695 --> 00:11:31.614
- I love jelly beans.
- Slacker.


148
00:11:33.282 --> 00:11:35.618
That's hilarious. What is it?

149
00:11:35.785 --> 00:11:38.204
I don't know. It looks like a bong.

150
00:11:44.293 --> 00:11:46.128
Well, Clapton...

151
00:11:46.754 --> 00:11:48.297
...I'm wet.

152
00:12:12.989 --> 00:12:14.657
I get it.

153
00:12:14.907 --> 00:12:17.994
Listening to your loud music.
Tripping out to Fraggle <i>Rock.</i>


154
00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:22.331
But the question is,
what does the future hold...


155
00:12:22.498 --> 00:12:24.834
...for Clapton Davis?

156
00:12:25.001 --> 00:12:27.837
Well, I am starting
my own music site.


157
00:12:28.337 --> 00:12:30.339
It'll list new releases
and review albums...


158
00:12:30.506 --> 00:12:32.341
...from bands
that nobody has heard of.


159
00:12:32.508 --> 00:12:35.303
If they have, I'll dismiss them
with scathing comparisons...


160
00:12:35.469 --> 00:12:37.263
...to avant-garde folk rockers.

161
00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:39.473
Everything is graded on
a 100-point scale.


162
00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:41.267
- No place for feedback.
- Excellent.


163
00:12:41.434 --> 00:12:45.688
Readers can bitch on their Twitters.
Good taste is not a democracy.


164
00:12:47.273 --> 00:12:50.026
And this pays what, 13.5 a year?

165
00:12:50.651 --> 00:12:53.321
Free Costello tickets.

166
00:12:59.827 --> 00:13:04.832
Do you think that I am
teaching students out of love?


167
00:13:06.542 --> 00:13:08.210
I'm not.

168
00:13:08.377 --> 00:13:12.715
It's your senior year
and your GPA is...


169
00:13:12.882 --> 00:13:14.800
It's a disgrace.

170
00:13:15.343 --> 00:13:18.387
But I'd rather not see you
back here next fall.


171
00:13:18.554 --> 00:13:21.807
Give me an excuse to graduate you.

172
00:13:21.974 --> 00:13:23.809
Impress me.

173
00:13:24.268 --> 00:13:27.730
Get an A. Save a small country.
Something.


174
00:13:27.897 --> 00:13:29.231
Anything-

175
00:13:29.398 --> 00:13:31.734
Otherwise, get expelled...

176
00:13:31.901 --> 00:13:36.530
...with the lowest grades
in Grizzly Lake history.


177
00:13:39.742 --> 00:13:40.910
Does Home Ec count?

178
00:13:41.077 --> 00:13:43.913
Get your shit together, son.

179
00:13:47.249 --> 00:13:51.587
I make 40 g's a year plus dental.
You may not have a Skittle.


180
00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:59.678
Thanks, Mr. Kendall.

181
00:14:05.309 --> 00:14:06.394
Princess?

182
00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:08.437
- Lone.
- Looks like Taylor's absent.


183
00:14:08.604 --> 00:14:11.941
You'll be head cheerleader for
the Grizzly Lake Bear playoff game.


184
00:14:12.942 --> 00:14:14.443
Don't do that.

185
00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:16.028
You there!

186
00:14:16.195 --> 00:14:18.280
- Riley.
- Sure you are, Crutches.


187
00:14:18.447 --> 00:14:20.366
You'll have to be
the Grizzly Lake bear.


188
00:14:20.533 --> 00:14:22.576
Mascot?

189
00:14:22.743 --> 00:14:26.372
Wearing the bear suit is a privilege
enjoyed by a few. Put it on.


190
00:14:26.539 --> 00:14:28.332
Time to get serious, dude.

191
00:14:30.459 --> 00:14:32.378
- Is this real fur?
- That goes for you too.


192
00:14:32.545 --> 00:14:34.964
- Don't you mess this up!
- I won't, Mr. Cooper.


193
00:14:35.131 --> 00:14:37.258
You're as funny
as Bronson Pinchot.


194
00:14:38.926 --> 00:14:40.803
Let me hear you growl!

195
00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:42.972
Attack!

196
00:14:44.348 --> 00:14:45.474
Typecast.

197
00:15:02.992 --> 00:15:04.827
<i>One and two! 
Feel it, whoo!</i>

198
00:15:04.994 --> 00:15:06.412
That's the spirit, lone.

199
00:15:06.579 --> 00:15:09.999
I was wondering when Freedom
Williams would make a comeback!


200
00:15:19.341 --> 00:15:21.677
- F in dodgeball too.
- You suck!


201
00:15:24.305 --> 00:15:25.473
<i>Road House?</i>

202
00:15:25.639 --> 00:15:29.018
Patrick Swayze didn't get Kelly Lynch
without ripping some throats first.


203
00:15:29.185 --> 00:15:33.522
- I need to study if I'm gonna fight Billy.
- You can't be planning on fighting him.


204
00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:38.694
Three o'clock, Clapton!
You're fucking dead!


205
00:15:38.903 --> 00:15:40.988
Well, I guess he still likes lone.

206
00:15:42.198 --> 00:15:44.992
Never underestimate the appeal
of stupid, cute things.


207
00:15:45.367 --> 00:15:48.954
The girl's a moron. But you don't--?
You don't have a thing for her, do you?


208
00:15:49.121 --> 00:15:53.375
Sander, lone's an old soul trapped in
a very painfully hot cheerleader body.


209
00:15:53.542 --> 00:15:57.046
She knows the "Fields of Gold" lyrics.
Every little thing she does is magic.


210
00:15:57.213 --> 00:15:59.215
- Believe it.
- I believe in things I can see.


211
00:15:59.423 --> 00:16:01.550
I believe in violence.

212
00:16:01.717 --> 00:16:06.305
I believe in trees,
mortgages and albinos.


213
00:16:08.974 --> 00:16:10.309
Wet T-shirt.

214
00:16:10.476 --> 00:16:13.062
Patrick Swayze was only
an action star for three years.


215
00:16:13.229 --> 00:16:17.399
Steven Seagal is a lifelong Buddhist
and a deadly master of aikido.


216
00:16:17.566 --> 00:16:20.194
Wrong. Mullet beats ponytails.

217
00:16:21.737 --> 00:16:24.573
Red shirt.

218
00:16:27.743 --> 00:16:30.746
What if that innocent cow
was your son?


219
00:16:32.331 --> 00:16:34.250
Or your daughter?

220
00:16:35.251 --> 00:16:38.504
Now, scientists don't know
whether fish feel pain...


221
00:16:38.671 --> 00:16:43.259
...so some vegetarians
still eat salmon and stuff.


222
00:16:43.467 --> 00:16:48.764
But do you know how much pigs
or, like, veal suffer?


223
00:16:48.931 --> 00:16:52.768
Is the only reason they live
just to be killed?


224
00:16:52.935 --> 00:16:54.520
Meat is murder.

225
00:16:58.190 --> 00:17:00.109
Nice work, Riley.

226
00:17:00.276 --> 00:17:04.113
Now, for the counter-argument,
we turn to Gord.


227
00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:06.448
Gord is our Canadian
exchange student...


228
00:17:06.615 --> 00:17:08.951
...from Lunenburg, 
Nova Scotia...

229
00:17:09.118 --> 00:17:12.288
...where I hear the salmon
is delicious.


230
00:17:12.454 --> 00:17:13.455
Gord?

231
00:17:13.622 --> 00:17:17.960
Yes, I'd like to start off by saying
that this girl's argument is ridiculous.


232
00:17:18.127 --> 00:17:20.963
Vegetarians who eat fish
are hypocrites.


233
00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:24.633
She thinks because fish may feel
no pain, they don't value their lives.


234
00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:29.138
Absurd. And notice how she expresses
almost no sympathy for chickens.


235
00:17:29.305 --> 00:17:31.807
That's because Americans
hate chickens.


236
00:17:32.016 --> 00:17:34.977
For example,
KFC serves popcorn chicken...


237
00:17:35.144 --> 00:17:38.647
...to assure the customers
that the chicken was blown to bits...


238
00:17:38.814 --> 00:17:42.484
...yet the meatball sub at Subway
isn't called "popcorn cow."


239
00:17:42.651 --> 00:17:45.154
Americans want chickens to die.

240
00:17:45.321 --> 00:17:48.324
Lame! Personally,
I do feel sympathy for animals...


241
00:17:48.532 --> 00:17:51.493
...which is why I choose
to only eat baby animals.


242
00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:54.580
They have not lived as long
and are not leaving as much behind.


243
00:17:54.997 --> 00:17:59.168
Baby clams, chicken wings,
baby seals, no big loss.


244
00:17:59.668 --> 00:18:02.504
If we don't eat meat,
we lose our place in the food chain.


245
00:18:02.671 --> 00:18:05.299
Eating animals gives us confidence
as humans.


246
00:18:05.549 --> 00:18:09.011
Vegetarians like this girl,
who is only wearing one shoe...


247
00:18:09.178 --> 00:18:11.347
...have less confidence
than everybody else.


248
00:18:11.513 --> 00:18:13.599
Thank you, class. Ms. Maclntire.

249
00:18:13.766 --> 00:18:15.976
Very well researched, Gord.

250
00:18:16.685 --> 00:18:18.520
And, yes, it's true.

251
00:18:18.687 --> 00:18:22.483
Teenagers need self-confidence.

252
00:18:30.574 --> 00:18:35.537
Clamato: the only animal-mammal
beverage at the grocery store.


253
00:18:36.538 --> 00:18:40.167
Which is too bad, because I could
really go for some carbonated dolphin.


254
00:18:40.334 --> 00:18:42.044
Why must you interrupt
my solitude...


255
00:18:42.211 --> 00:18:45.297
...in the worst day of the worst life
in Grizzly Lake history?


256
00:18:45.464 --> 00:18:48.384
- You're not the girl who fucked a bear.
- That was 20 years ago.


257
00:18:48.550 --> 00:18:50.386
And she was a pervert.
I'm a mascot.


258
00:18:50.552 --> 00:18:53.222
It's one rank lower
on the social ladder.


259
00:18:53.389 --> 00:18:56.016
It's true.
I've been thinking about stuff.


260
00:18:56.183 --> 00:18:57.685
Nudity, mostly.

261
00:18:57.851 --> 00:18:59.395
You know, we don't talk much...

262
00:18:59.603 --> 00:19:02.898
...but I like to believe we've been
sort of friends for a while.


263
00:19:03.107 --> 00:19:05.109
Arguable, but not outlandish.

264
00:19:05.401 --> 00:19:09.405
Okay, this human-conversation thing
is not working for you. Let's text.


265
00:19:10.906 --> 00:19:12.408
<i>You better not sext me.</i>

266
00:19:12.574 --> 00:19:14.868
<i>Not interested in the rules.</i>

267
00:19:15.035 --> 00:19:16.245
<i>Yeah, I figured.</i>

268
00:19:16.412 --> 00:19:19.373
<i>Courtship, social ethics,
what people think.</i>


269
00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:21.041
<i>Very true. You're right.</i>

270
00:19:23.752 --> 00:19:25.921
- Sorry, that was for Clapton.
- What the frig!


271
00:19:26.088 --> 00:19:27.798
You know what?
Let's get it over with.


272
00:19:27.965 --> 00:19:30.134
- Let's have sex.
- I'm only gonna say this once.


273
00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:33.095
Do not become the bad guy
in the pregnancy-scare video.


274
00:19:33.262 --> 00:19:37.266
Playful banter is just a sign of
a healthy, caring communi-- Hold on.


275
00:19:39.643 --> 00:19:43.272
If you go sit somewhere else, we can
maybe go back to being sort of friends.


276
00:19:48.527 --> 00:19:51.864
- Mind if I sit here?
- Free country.


277
00:20:11.133 --> 00:20:14.803
Every day, you and I stand in
this hallway and no one notices.


278
00:20:15.929 --> 00:20:21.059
We're just hollow and useless...

279
00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:24.438
...and stuffed full of crap
nobody will ever see.


280
00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:28.776
I know who you are.

281
00:20:30.319 --> 00:20:31.987
You're me.

282
00:20:33.822 --> 00:20:35.407
Well, let's go.

283
00:20:37.117 --> 00:20:39.995
I mean, "Gonna Make You Sweat"?

284
00:20:40.204 --> 00:20:43.499
They let her get away
with making that look cool?


285
00:20:43.707 --> 00:20:46.877
And then I'm beaten by a Canadian
on the ethics of eating animals...


286
00:20:47.044 --> 00:20:50.589
...which makes no sense because
Canadians are supposed to be nice.


287
00:20:52.132 --> 00:20:53.342
See you, Clapton Davis.

288
00:20:53.509 --> 00:20:55.511
Hope my soundtrack
comes out on vinyl.


289
00:22:26.268 --> 00:22:30.105
Little dudes like you get worked.

290
00:22:30.272 --> 00:22:32.691
Let's see your teeth.
For dental records.


291
00:22:32.858 --> 00:22:36.111
Yeah, the next time you go
to the dentist and look at an x-ray...


292
00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:40.240
...it will be a picture
of your head flying off.


293
00:22:40.616 --> 00:22:43.785
- Shit. Get that molar.
- Somebody's trying to kill me!


294
00:22:43.952 --> 00:22:45.537
Join the club.

295
00:22:45.704 --> 00:22:47.623
Get out of my face, dude.

296
00:22:47.789 --> 00:22:51.293
Leave him alone, Nolan. We get it.
Your dick is bigger, all right?


297
00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:52.628
Wait, how do you know?

298
00:22:52.794 --> 00:22:55.547
Clapton, you're my Ralph Macchio.
Do the crane thing.


299
00:22:56.298 --> 00:22:59.134
I like you, lone,
but you're really weird.


300
00:22:59.301 --> 00:23:01.261
If your face hurts my fist...

301
00:23:01.970 --> 00:23:03.972
...I will punch you again harder.

302
00:23:08.143 --> 00:23:11.438
- Everyone take a step back.
- Hang on! I was here first.


303
00:23:11.855 --> 00:23:13.231
Listen up, folks.

304
00:23:13.398 --> 00:23:15.484
Your classmate Taylor Fisher...

305
00:23:15.651 --> 00:23:17.819
...was murdered in her bedroom
this morning.


306
00:23:17.986 --> 00:23:20.948
- What?
- I know this comes as a shock.


307
00:23:21.114 --> 00:23:23.367
We're gonna need to speak
to some of you in turn.


308
00:23:23.533 --> 00:23:27.329
- I was just attacked!
- Sure you were, honey.


309
00:23:37.506 --> 00:23:40.092
<i>The violent death of 17-year-old
Taylor Fisher...</i>


310
00:23:40.258 --> 00:23:42.094
<i>...has shaken the town
of Grizzly Lake.</i>


311
00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:44.012
<i>Fisher, a beloved
Bears cheerleader...</i>


312
00:23:45.472 --> 00:23:47.849
<i>...was getting ready for school
when an intruder stabbed--</i>


313
00:23:48.016 --> 00:23:50.519
<i>Jason Lawrence said
he saw blue lights in the sky...</i>


314
00:23:50.686 --> 00:23:53.772
...and <i>then mysteriously was
compelled to eat three cans of tuna</i>


315
00:23:53.939 --> 00:23:55.607
<i>...a food he typically hates.</i>

316
00:24:34.062 --> 00:24:36.314
Fuck everybody.

317
00:26:12.035 --> 00:26:16.248
- You ever do any rave drugs?
- A rave? What is this, 1996?


318
00:26:16.414 --> 00:26:18.500
This attacker you're describing,
Ms. Jones...


319
00:26:18.667 --> 00:26:21.044
-...sounds just like that horror film.
- Cinderhella.


320
00:26:21.211 --> 00:26:22.671
<i>Scream.</i>

321
00:26:22.838 --> 00:26:25.006
Cinderhella is only a movie.
It can't hurt you.


322
00:26:25.173 --> 00:26:27.592
- You know that?
- I don't know. See the first one?


323
00:26:27.759 --> 00:26:30.762
You're under the belief that
she attacked you? Cinderhella?


324
00:26:30.929 --> 00:26:33.181
Look, I am not a retarded
Neve Campbell, okay?


325
00:26:33.348 --> 00:26:35.308
Obviously, it was someone
dressed like her.


326
00:26:35.475 --> 00:26:39.020
- You nuked the fridge with that one.
- I'm sorry. I don't speak fanboy.


327
00:26:39.187 --> 00:26:43.150
Call if anything else comes to mind
or happens to you.


328
00:26:43.316 --> 00:26:46.027
Yeppers, I'll be sure to call you
when I'm murdered.


329
00:26:46.194 --> 00:26:50.282
Hey. A girl at your school is dead,
for real.


330
00:26:50.448 --> 00:26:52.033
Think about that.

331
00:26:52.868 --> 00:26:55.370
Iron Man. Now, that's a movie.

332
00:26:55.537 --> 00:26:57.622
Iron Man was fucking PG-13.

333
00:26:57.789 --> 00:27:00.876
Does this sound fucking PG-13
to you?


334
00:27:01.042 --> 00:27:02.878
Worst motive ever.

335
00:27:08.717 --> 00:27:11.136
What, you think I'm making this up?

336
00:27:12.345 --> 00:27:15.640
Come on, Riley,
there's nobody else here.


337
00:27:19.477 --> 00:27:20.896
Show me.

338
00:27:23.523 --> 00:27:26.735
Whoever's trying to kill me knows
that Cinderhella is a huge cliché.


339
00:27:26.902 --> 00:27:28.987
They know I know
nobody would believe me.


340
00:27:29.362 --> 00:27:31.740
It's a conspiracy
to get everyone to think...


341
00:27:31.907 --> 00:27:35.702
...I'm a total loser making pre-emptive,
mid-'90s pop references.


342
00:27:35.869 --> 00:27:37.913
Yeah, it's all coming
to an end anyways.


343
00:27:38.121 --> 00:27:40.874
- Translation?
- Our lives.


344
00:27:41.041 --> 00:27:43.835
This summer everyone in
Grizzly Lake is going to college...


345
00:27:44.002 --> 00:27:46.880
...to incubate their degrees,
get knocked up at a kegger...


346
00:27:47.047 --> 00:27:49.591
...and come back here to populate
one of these homes...


347
00:27:49.758 --> 00:27:53.345
...with tiny little versions of
themselves. These are our final days.


348
00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:55.096
Turn.

349
00:27:56.932 --> 00:27:59.601
What about your whole
music-criticism thing?


350
00:27:59.768 --> 00:28:04.022
You'll beat the odds.
You always do, Clapton Davis.


351
00:28:04.189 --> 00:28:07.442
Billy wants to eBay pieces of my face
and Verge is gonna fail me...


352
00:28:07.609 --> 00:28:09.527
...unless I get an A
or save the universe.


353
00:28:09.694 --> 00:28:12.280
Both equally improbable scenarios.

354
00:28:12.864 --> 00:28:13.907
Duck.

355
00:28:15.075 --> 00:28:18.203
You know, the whole cynic act
doesn't really fit on you.


356
00:28:18.370 --> 00:28:19.788
Can't change anything.

357
00:28:19.955 --> 00:28:23.291
Now is all we got. It's not cynicism.
I think now is pretty rad.


358
00:28:23.458 --> 00:28:27.212
Except one girl's dead and the other's
waiting for the noose to tighten.


359
00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:30.298
No.

360
00:28:30.757 --> 00:28:34.386
I'm talking about now, me and you.

361
00:28:34.552 --> 00:28:37.806
Look around. What don't you see?

362
00:28:39.307 --> 00:28:40.684
Cinderhella?

363
00:28:42.811 --> 00:28:44.312
Lone.

364
00:28:44.813 --> 00:28:46.982
Get over yourself. Seriously.

365
00:28:47.148 --> 00:28:49.276
My cast comes off tomorrow.

366
00:28:49.818 --> 00:28:53.238
- Wanna take me dancing?
- Clapton don't dance.


367
00:28:53.405 --> 00:28:56.157
Right, unless lone's playing Oasis.

368
00:28:56.324 --> 00:28:58.576
More Grizzly Lake kids
were conceived to Oasis...


369
00:28:58.743 --> 00:29:02.205
...than any other Beatles cover band.
<i>Definitely Maybe</i> is British Rohypnol.


370
00:29:02.622 --> 00:29:04.207
Eyes glazing.

371
00:29:06.668 --> 00:29:09.462
I made plans to see a movie
with lone tomorrow night.


372
00:29:10.338 --> 00:29:12.799
Make room for a third wheel.

373
00:29:23.685 --> 00:29:26.187
Cinderhella, please. No.

374
00:29:26.354 --> 00:29:28.940
Why are you crying?

375
00:29:29.357 --> 00:29:32.527
This is the happiest night of your life.
You're prom queen.


376
00:29:32.694 --> 00:29:36.781
It didn't mean anything, okay?
I swear. It was just sex.


377
00:29:36.948 --> 00:29:41.036
Oh, no, Wendy.
It was the worst kind of sex.


378
00:29:41.244 --> 00:29:42.370
Premarital.

379
00:29:42.537 --> 00:29:44.873
I won't tell anyone, I swear.
Just let me go.


380
00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:48.043
I'll let you go,
but only if the glass slipper fits.


381
00:29:48.209 --> 00:29:51.212
It's deep inside
your lower abdomen.


382
00:29:51.379 --> 00:29:53.882
- Oh, no.
- Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.


383
00:29:54.049 --> 00:29:58.053
If you take longer than two minutes,
it'll be a whole new crown of thorns.


384
00:30:00.263 --> 00:30:02.223
Start digging-

385
00:30:02.891 --> 00:30:04.267
Clock's ticking.

386
00:30:08.146 --> 00:30:10.231
<i>Oh, God!</i>

387
00:30:13.068 --> 00:30:14.402
Say cheese.

388
00:30:15.070 --> 00:30:17.989
If you wanted to take pictures,
you should have stayed at home.


389
00:30:18.156 --> 00:30:21.159
- Eat my shorts, jerk.
- I'll murder you, bitch.


390
00:30:21.326 --> 00:30:22.410
"Eat my shorts"?

391
00:30:22.577 --> 00:30:25.705
There's always some dickweed
trying to spoil people's fun.


392
00:30:25.997 --> 00:30:28.875
- This film is gnarly.
- Gnarly.


393
00:30:29.584 --> 00:30:33.380
It's not fair. I've been doing
Pilates all senior year.


394
00:30:33.546 --> 00:30:35.882
My stomach muscles
are too tight to dig through.


395
00:30:36.049 --> 00:30:39.177
Oh, Wendy,
why didn't you think about that...


396
00:30:39.344 --> 00:30:43.515
...before you offered Scott
your after-school special?


397
00:30:43.681 --> 00:30:45.850
Cinderhella is a moralist.

398
00:30:46.017 --> 00:30:48.561
This is probably the best movie
since Volcano.


399
00:30:48.728 --> 00:30:52.357
And the award for most vapid
film review of the century goes to...


400
00:30:52.524 --> 00:30:54.776
- Can you try being nice?
- Clapton's with me.


401
00:30:54.943 --> 00:30:57.695
- Quit being a space cadet.
- I don't like Clapton.


402
00:30:58.279 --> 00:30:59.989
- I don't care.
- White people, shut it!


403
00:31:00.156 --> 00:31:02.867
But you know he's my own
Michael Keaton, right?


404
00:31:03.034 --> 00:31:05.286
Will you give it up
with your '90s obsession?


405
00:31:05.453 --> 00:31:07.622
1992 was, like, the coolest year ever.

406
00:31:07.831 --> 00:31:11.084
Speaking of which, nice plagiarism
on your debate with the Canadian.


407
00:31:11.251 --> 00:31:12.627
"Meat is murder"?

408
00:31:12.794 --> 00:31:15.422
Everyone knows Morrissey's
<i>Kill Uncle</i> was better.


409
00:31:15.588 --> 00:31:17.132
- Is it?
- You're such a nimrod.


410
00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:18.800
Will you stop talking?

411
00:31:18.967 --> 00:31:21.302
We have rules of conduct.
Your ticket's a contract.


412
00:31:21.469 --> 00:31:23.638
- Shut up, lumberjack!
- What is the contract?


413
00:31:23.847 --> 00:31:26.808
There's to be no illegal photography
inside of Galaxy Cinemas.


414
00:31:26.975 --> 00:31:29.477
That is not the way
a capitalist society functions.


415
00:31:29.644 --> 00:31:31.813
When you take photography
inside of cinemas...


416
00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:35.275
...you take money from carpenters
trying to feed their families.


417
00:31:35.442 --> 00:31:37.068
Closing statement?

418
00:31:37.235 --> 00:31:38.319
Silence is compliance.

419
00:31:52.917 --> 00:31:55.587
Do the math, baby. 
Taylor was hot.

420
00:31:55.753 --> 00:31:56.838
I was watching Smurfs.

421
00:31:57.005 --> 00:31:59.007
Neve Campbell was hot.
Jamie Lee Curtis?


422
00:31:59.174 --> 00:32:01.676
- I just BitTorrented Avatar.
- I'd get jiggy with it.


423
00:32:01.885 --> 00:32:05.180
Rephrase this for me, lone.
Your glamazon logic is too advanced.


424
00:32:05.388 --> 00:32:07.849
- They look nothing like Smurfs.
- Riley. As if.


425
00:32:08.016 --> 00:32:09.934
You're not banging enough
to be murdered.


426
00:32:10.101 --> 00:32:12.353
- They're blue.
- Plus, you live in a bungalow.


427
00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:14.606
Slasher-film heroines
live in McMansions.


428
00:32:14.772 --> 00:32:16.191
They don't look alike.

429
00:32:16.357 --> 00:32:20.028
Wow, that was 70 percent appalling
and 30 percent really perceptive.


430
00:32:20.528 --> 00:32:24.282
- BT-dubs, Cinderhella is my stalker.
- Definition, "stalker":


431
00:32:24.449 --> 00:32:27.827
<i>Stalker, noun. Someone who is not
hot enough to be seen with you.</i>


432
00:32:29.204 --> 00:32:30.538
lone makes a compelling case.

433
00:32:30.705 --> 00:32:33.833
If someone were to be
slashed and killed, I'd vote for her.


434
00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.044
You're all that and a bag of chips,
Clapton.


435
00:32:36.211 --> 00:32:38.963
It's not like Taylor Fisher
won a popularity contest.


436
00:32:39.130 --> 00:32:42.467
She was murdered. You guys are
watching bimbos-get-tortured porn...


437
00:32:42.634 --> 00:32:45.428
...to feed some music-video director's
coke habit.


438
00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:47.388
Taylor died because she had it all.

439
00:32:47.555 --> 00:32:49.891
She was the most popular girl.
Nobody hated her.


440
00:32:50.058 --> 00:32:52.185
I'd hide in a sporting-goods store
if zombies attacked.


441
00:32:52.352 --> 00:32:55.730
Correction: She was the most
popular girl. Everybody hated her.


442
00:32:55.897 --> 00:32:58.316
- Costco.
- FYI, lone, you can't be the hero.


443
00:32:58.483 --> 00:33:00.860
- No zombie memberships.
- Scream queens are virgins.


444
00:33:01.027 --> 00:33:04.822
Riley does have superhero
impenetrability on her side.


445
00:33:04.989 --> 00:33:07.158
Donald Waters.

446
00:33:08.076 --> 00:33:10.161
He said "an anaconda"
and "ice cube."


447
00:33:10.328 --> 00:33:12.247
I thought he was asking me to...

448
00:33:12.413 --> 00:33:14.916
...watch a movie.

449
00:33:15.542 --> 00:33:19.254
- Waters? That's gross.
- Cuts virginity out of the equation.


450
00:33:19.921 --> 00:33:21.756
Cinderhella wants to kill me more.

451
00:33:21.965 --> 00:33:25.176
I'm hot. Your house sucks. You lose.

452
00:33:29.264 --> 00:33:31.766
Do you think Clapton would say yes
if I asked him out?


453
00:33:31.933 --> 00:33:34.394
Riley, you have to do it.

454
00:33:34.561 --> 00:33:36.688
You two have been
best friends forever.


455
00:33:36.854 --> 00:33:38.982
- Hey, Clapton.
- Hey, Clapton.


456
00:33:40.942 --> 00:33:44.279
He can ride me like that unicycle.

457
00:33:45.113 --> 00:33:46.197
<i>You!</i>

458
00:33:46.364 --> 00:33:48.449
Fartknocker!

459
00:33:52.036 --> 00:33:54.789
Taylor Fisher was a paradigm
of human excellence.


460
00:33:55.582 --> 00:33:57.542
Terrible shame this has to happen.

461
00:33:57.709 --> 00:33:59.085
- Yeah.
- Yeah.


462
00:33:59.794 --> 00:34:02.964
Problem with kids today, they don't
know how to channel aggression.


463
00:34:03.131 --> 00:34:06.134
Football! That's the way.

464
00:34:06.301 --> 00:34:08.303
Otherwise,
they're dreaming of girls...


465
00:34:08.469 --> 00:34:11.306
...and end up in prison
on rape charges.


466
00:34:11.806 --> 00:34:12.890
Yeah.

467
00:34:13.057 --> 00:34:17.312
They close the school to let us grieve,
and everyone shows up at the mall.


468
00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:19.272
These people make me sick.

469
00:34:19.439 --> 00:34:22.483
Remember, there's a costume party
later at my place.


470
00:34:24.152 --> 00:34:26.154
Ready for the big game tonight,
coach?


471
00:34:26.321 --> 00:34:28.656
Always ready for football!

472
00:34:29.616 --> 00:34:31.826
You're dead, Clapton.

473
00:34:34.787 --> 00:34:36.080
Gotta fled.

474
00:34:37.415 --> 00:34:39.167
I gotta pick up prom tickets.

475
00:34:39.334 --> 00:34:40.668
But what about Taylor?

476
00:34:40.835 --> 00:34:42.629
Run, blond gal, run!

477
00:34:42.795 --> 00:34:45.465
<i>Hotel</i> for Dogs is on cable soon.

478
00:34:56.768 --> 00:34:59.020
I guess the rumours
that you don't trim are true.


479
00:34:59.187 --> 00:35:02.315
Taking nude photographs
with little kids is sick.


480
00:35:05.318 --> 00:35:08.529
Here we go! Let's play some football!
Bust some heads!


481
00:35:08.696 --> 00:35:11.032
Let's break some hands!
Break a claw!


482
00:35:11.199 --> 00:35:12.867
Take it in!

483
00:35:17.205 --> 00:35:20.792
Watch 32. Set. Hut!

484
00:35:28.508 --> 00:35:30.385
Nolan, I'm open. 
What the fuck?

485
00:35:30.593 --> 00:35:33.096
Let go of the goddamn ball!
What the--?


486
00:35:34.097 --> 00:35:35.682
What the hell do you think--?

487
00:35:40.603 --> 00:35:42.522
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry.


488
00:35:42.689 --> 00:35:44.732
- Booger! Get off!
- Come on, Nolan.


489
00:35:44.899 --> 00:35:46.401
- Get in the game!
- I'm trying!


490
00:35:47.068 --> 00:35:48.820
- What is that?
- Get off the bear!


491
00:35:48.986 --> 00:35:50.363
You saw nothing.

492
00:35:50.905 --> 00:35:54.200
Nothing! Shut up!

493
00:35:54.659 --> 00:35:56.411
Nolan, you all right?

494
00:36:03.334 --> 00:36:04.752
What the hell do you think--?

495
00:36:04.919 --> 00:36:07.672
What is that? Goddamn it!

496
00:36:08.673 --> 00:36:10.091
Get out of here!

497
00:36:10.258 --> 00:36:11.342
Billy, hold on a sec.

498
00:36:11.926 --> 00:36:15.221
You resolve all your boy troubles
in the men's room?


499
00:36:15.388 --> 00:36:17.598
Why are you gonna fight Clapton?
So junior high.


500
00:36:17.765 --> 00:36:19.934
All that juicing is freaking you out.

501
00:36:20.101 --> 00:36:21.436
Juicing?

502
00:36:21.644 --> 00:36:25.440
Does this look like steroids to you?

503
00:36:26.149 --> 00:36:29.444
Yeah, nice biceps. 
You're a freak!

504
00:36:31.279 --> 00:36:33.781
You wanna know the story
of the real Billy Nolan?


505
00:36:34.365 --> 00:36:36.284
Your eyes are bloodshot,
you vomit acid...


506
00:36:36.451 --> 00:36:39.120
...and your brain is scrambled
from all the football hits.


507
00:36:39.287 --> 00:36:41.289
Sure, lay it on me.

508
00:36:42.790 --> 00:36:47.211
I have fly blood in my veins.

509
00:36:47.378 --> 00:36:49.297
I'm a freak.

510
00:36:53.968 --> 00:36:55.595
Robot dog.

511
00:36:59.182 --> 00:37:00.725
Billy, I told you 100 damn times.

512
00:37:00.892 --> 00:37:03.311
Get that dog out of here
when I'm watching the set.


513
00:37:03.478 --> 00:37:05.229
He's blocking the game.

514
00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:09.817
Why does he hate me?

515
00:37:38.304 --> 00:37:41.015
All I have in the
world is my TV set.

516
00:37:41.808 --> 00:37:44.435
Never take this off, boy.

517
00:37:44.852 --> 00:37:48.523
No one can know
that my son's a freak.


518
00:37:48.940 --> 00:37:52.860
<i>TV hand! TV hand! TV hand!</i>

519
00:37:55.279 --> 00:37:56.656
Hike!

520
00:37:58.032 --> 00:38:01.536
<i>TV hand! TV hand! TV hand!</i>

521
00:38:25.059 --> 00:38:27.854
And that's exactly
how I remember it.


522
00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:30.398
You have got to cut down
on the protein shakes.


523
00:38:30.565 --> 00:38:34.193
- Get lost! You don't know shit!
- If you fight Clapton, I'll tell everyone.


524
00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:36.320
You think they give trophies
to larvae?


525
00:38:37.196 --> 00:38:39.532
- My hand.
- Come on!


526
00:38:39.699 --> 00:38:41.367
I'm trying...

527
00:38:41.534 --> 00:38:42.910
Billy, we really need to talk.

528
00:38:45.496 --> 00:38:47.915
Is this when I'm supposed to say,
"How could you?"


529
00:38:48.082 --> 00:38:50.710
Am I supposed to say,
"it's not what it looks like"?


530
00:38:50.877 --> 00:38:52.753
What, are you two fucking?

531
00:39:04.056 --> 00:39:06.601
Welcome to the Sandersons'.
Don't speak more loudly...


532
00:39:06.809 --> 00:39:10.229
...than you would at your home. If you
have to go number one, go outside.


533
00:39:10.396 --> 00:39:13.316
If it's number two, you go home.

534
00:39:18.779 --> 00:39:20.781
Why'd you tell me
this was a costume party?


535
00:39:20.948 --> 00:39:23.951
Because it is.

536
00:39:24.118 --> 00:39:25.828
Fag.

537
00:39:26.037 --> 00:39:27.914
Who are you supposed to be,
Super Mario?


538
00:39:28.539 --> 00:39:29.874
Angela Chase.

539
00:39:30.041 --> 00:39:31.959
She of the So-Called <i>Life,</i>
Claire Danes?


540
00:39:32.126 --> 00:39:35.296
If it wasn't on men's curling,
I probably haven't seen it.


541
00:39:35.630 --> 00:39:39.467
- We're the least cool people here.
- No, speak for yourself.


542
00:39:39.634 --> 00:39:41.552
I'm dressed as
Captain Jean-Luc Picard.


543
00:39:41.719 --> 00:39:44.305
Setting off some pheromones.

544
00:39:44.472 --> 00:39:46.766
I thought you were an ice skater.

545
00:39:47.642 --> 00:39:49.936
- Do you like fish sticks?
- Oh, my God!


546
00:39:50.102 --> 00:39:52.521
In Canada, people drink
what they bring to the party.


547
00:39:52.688 --> 00:39:56.317
This whole Marxist alcohol
partition thing is new to me.


548
00:39:56.484 --> 00:39:59.153
I like to mooch the good stuff.

549
00:39:59.612 --> 00:40:03.783
So Canada, eh?

550
00:40:03.950 --> 00:40:07.662
Is it true you guys
never lock your doors?


551
00:40:29.850 --> 00:40:32.603
Suck it, bitches.

552
00:40:34.522 --> 00:40:36.399
Gag.

553
00:40:51.330 --> 00:40:54.041
I have no witty retort to that.

554
00:40:54.291 --> 00:40:57.878
Just kiss me and make sure Clapton
sees that shit.


555
00:40:58.045 --> 00:40:59.547
Engage.

556
00:41:01.048 --> 00:41:03.467
I am fever!

557
00:41:03.718 --> 00:41:07.221
I hope you're having
as much fun as us, Clapton.


558
00:41:07.430 --> 00:41:08.973
As much fun as Billy had?

559
00:41:10.933 --> 00:41:13.894
If your mind is being controlled
by Wrath of Khan slugs...


560
00:41:14.061 --> 00:41:17.565
...I just want you to know
that I am cool with it.


561
00:41:23.029 --> 00:41:24.905
Let's dance, Sander...

562
00:41:25.072 --> 00:41:29.076
...because Clapton don't dance.

563
00:41:41.338 --> 00:41:42.715
Not awesome.

564
00:41:56.062 --> 00:41:57.271
I think I'm gonna barf.

565
00:41:59.273 --> 00:42:00.691
Your bra hooked my ring.

566
00:42:00.858 --> 00:42:04.111
Don't stretch my suspenders.
These overalls are vintage 1994.


567
00:42:04.278 --> 00:42:07.281
This is a limited-edition
LeVar Burton Starfleet pinkie ring.


568
00:42:07.448 --> 00:42:10.076
I had to eat Whole Wheat Crackles
for a year to get one.


569
00:42:10.242 --> 00:42:12.286
- Creeper. Beam off!
- Trust me.


570
00:42:15.289 --> 00:42:16.916
That dude has tits.

571
00:42:17.291 --> 00:42:18.584
Finally happened for me.

572
00:42:19.585 --> 00:42:23.214
Clapton Davis!

573
00:42:25.007 --> 00:42:27.885
Tonight will prove my theory...

574
00:42:29.136 --> 00:42:31.639
...that lone won't go to prom...

575
00:42:32.264 --> 00:42:34.308
...with someone
who has been murdered!


576
00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:38.646
Go on, Clapton. 
I believe in you.

577
00:42:38.813 --> 00:42:42.149
How about you use that motivational
speech to talk Billy out of it?


578
00:42:42.316 --> 00:42:44.318
He's not gonna stop
until you step up.


579
00:42:44.777 --> 00:42:46.821
You just have to lay down the law.

580
00:42:47.488 --> 00:42:48.989
What if I lay down in pain?

581
00:42:49.156 --> 00:42:52.785
Remember, Clapton,
pain don't hurt.


582
00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:56.539
Red shirt. Damn.

583
00:42:58.666 --> 00:42:59.667
All right, Billy.

584
00:43:00.501 --> 00:43:02.002
Clapton Davis.

585
00:43:03.170 --> 00:43:05.339
You are not as much of a pussy
as I thought


586
00:43:05.506 --> 00:43:08.509
- Do you wanna do this the easy way?
- What's the easy way?


587
00:43:09.176 --> 00:43:13.430
Stop being so smart, all right?
You're dead either way.


588
00:43:13.597 --> 00:43:16.350
Well, thank you
for explaining my op--


589
00:43:20.187 --> 00:43:21.313
Thank God that's not me.

590
00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:23.691
Goal!

591
00:43:50.885 --> 00:43:52.386
It's go time, Clapton.

592
00:43:52.553 --> 00:43:54.513
Shut up, lone!

593
00:43:55.222 --> 00:43:57.474
It's no wonder I broke up with you.

594
00:43:57.641 --> 00:43:59.476
Clapton Davis is a genius!

595
00:43:59.643 --> 00:44:04.190
Would you go back in time to punch
Benjamin Franklin and Spike Lee too?


596
00:44:06.233 --> 00:44:08.569
Get out of my face, ho!

597
00:44:08.736 --> 00:44:12.740
And you lied to me. It is not normal
for people's semen to glow in the dark.


598
00:44:12.907 --> 00:44:16.243
Billy, she never saw my semen,
I swear to God.


599
00:44:19.205 --> 00:44:24.335
I cannot believe you just said that
in front of all these people.


600
00:44:26.587 --> 00:44:27.630
Did I Win?

601
00:44:58.619 --> 00:45:00.246
What the--?

602
00:45:01.789 --> 00:45:04.041
Why don't you take a picture, homo?

603
00:45:09.797 --> 00:45:14.301
Stop messing with my buzz!

604
00:45:26.814 --> 00:45:29.817
<i>This shocking footage was recorded
by a witness earlier today.</i>


605
00:45:29.984 --> 00:45:32.111
<i>Be warned,
the images here are disturbing.</i>


606
00:45:46.333 --> 00:45:48.294
How you feeling?

607
00:45:48.669 --> 00:45:50.671
Well, my vision's diagonal...

608
00:45:50.838 --> 00:45:53.173
...I can't breathe
without thinking about it...


609
00:45:53.340 --> 00:45:55.801
...I can hear
other people's thoughts...


610
00:45:55.968 --> 00:45:57.970
...and it looks like
you're eating meat.


611
00:45:58.137 --> 00:46:01.348
Other than that, tip-top shape.

612
00:46:01.682 --> 00:46:06.186
Not only do I eat meat,
but I am now a porno star.


613
00:46:07.187 --> 00:46:09.523
Parties are so full of self-discovery.

614
00:46:09.690 --> 00:46:11.025
Moo-licious.

615
00:46:30.836 --> 00:46:33.672
Being a mascot is a proud tradition.

616
00:46:33.839 --> 00:46:36.383
You represent the honour
of Grizzly Lake High.


617
00:46:36.550 --> 00:46:38.385
When you take off
that bear costume...


618
00:46:38.552 --> 00:46:41.555
...you should walk like your body
is still covered in fur.


619
00:46:41.722 --> 00:46:45.726
The video of your mammary gland...

620
00:46:45.893 --> 00:46:50.397
...was viewed 20,000 times
on the Internet.


621
00:46:50.564 --> 00:46:51.899
- YouTube?
- National Zoology.


622
00:46:52.066 --> 00:46:54.485
- Can I throw up?
- It's also in the news.


623
00:46:54.651 --> 00:46:57.196
Billy Nolan is killed
in the same video.


624
00:46:57.363 --> 00:46:59.740
Who taught you how to make
a snuff porno? Lady Gaga?


625
00:47:00.032 --> 00:47:03.702
Wait. Are you guys
accusing me of something?


626
00:47:07.915 --> 00:47:10.709
Your nipple was exposed
for seven whole seconds.


627
00:47:10.876 --> 00:47:13.921
Is that why two of my brightest
students were killed?


628
00:47:14.088 --> 00:47:15.422
For seven seconds of video?

629
00:47:15.589 --> 00:47:17.257
- Did you all watch it?
- I didn't.


630
00:47:17.424 --> 00:47:19.176
Why not?

631
00:47:19.343 --> 00:47:23.097
I am giving everybody implicated
as being anywhere near Billy Nolan...


632
00:47:23.263 --> 00:47:25.891
...on that tape Saturday detention.

633
00:47:26.183 --> 00:47:28.268
- Tomorrow?
- Tomorrow.


634
00:47:28.435 --> 00:47:30.687
- Tomorrow is prom.
- This is murder.


635
00:47:31.021 --> 00:47:33.107
And porn.
There's a killer in Grizzly Lake...


636
00:47:33.273 --> 00:47:36.276
...who is affiliated
with people at my school.


637
00:47:36.443 --> 00:47:40.531
Detention is in the library.
It goes from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m.


638
00:47:40.697 --> 00:47:43.534
That's right through prom.

639
00:47:43.700 --> 00:47:45.869
I thought Saturday detention
was a myth.


640
00:47:46.036 --> 00:47:47.830
So was ice-skater porn.

641
00:48:02.386 --> 00:48:05.347
Riley, don't ever degrade yourself.

642
00:48:05.639 --> 00:48:08.142
Don't let them make you think
that you're not valuable.


643
00:48:08.725 --> 00:48:10.811
- Mr. Kendall--
- Respect your body.


644
00:48:12.312 --> 00:48:15.816
This is just a big misunderstanding.

645
00:48:16.275 --> 00:48:21.155
A wise man once said that we're all
a bunch of big misunderstandings.


646
00:48:22.281 --> 00:48:24.158
His name was Deepak Chopra.

647
00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:30.789
What difference does it make now?
I'm just...


648
00:48:32.833 --> 00:48:35.335
I'm just a stupid porn star.

649
00:48:37.171 --> 00:48:38.839
No, Riley.

650
00:48:40.007 --> 00:48:43.886
You're a beautiful girl
whose voice just needs to be heard.


651
00:49:06.533 --> 00:49:08.702
I'm a porn star.

652
00:49:09.870 --> 00:49:11.538
Young.

653
00:49:12.456 --> 00:49:14.208
Hot.

654
00:49:14.541 --> 00:49:15.918
Porn.

655
00:49:18.629 --> 00:49:20.172
We just need to take a moment...

656
00:49:20.339 --> 00:49:25.552
...to look into each other's eyes
and centre our chakra.


657
00:49:26.053 --> 00:49:28.222
You're looking for
something deeper.


658
00:49:28.430 --> 00:49:32.392
Yeah. Yeah, I am. 
I like older guys.

659
00:49:32.559 --> 00:49:35.521
Like age 36...

660
00:49:35.687 --> 00:49:38.732
...or 39 or 35 or something.

661
00:49:39.942 --> 00:49:41.568
Riley.

662
00:49:43.237 --> 00:49:44.905
That's right.

663
00:49:45.739 --> 00:49:48.742
There's always a new way
of looking at each other.


664
00:52:01.458 --> 00:52:03.960
Okay, suspects.

665
00:52:04.127 --> 00:52:07.547
Tell me who the killer is,
and I'll let you go home...


666
00:52:07.714 --> 00:52:09.091
...and go to your little prom.

667
00:52:09.883 --> 00:52:10.967
Taylor Fisher.

668
00:52:11.134 --> 00:52:12.719
I don't believe you.

669
00:52:12.886 --> 00:52:16.223
We have rights.
You can't lock us up without evidence.


670
00:52:16.848 --> 00:52:20.394
This isn't jail.

671
00:52:20.894 --> 00:52:22.729
It's detention.

672
00:52:38.036 --> 00:52:41.498
Well, we can rule out Gord.

673
00:52:41.665 --> 00:52:43.875
Canadians don't kill
outside their home country.


674
00:52:44.042 --> 00:52:45.919
Yeah, well,
we can count Sander out too.


675
00:52:46.086 --> 00:52:49.506
Nolan was chopped up with an axe.
Ever seen Sander try to swing a bat?


676
00:52:49.673 --> 00:52:50.757
I was sick that day.

677
00:52:50.924 --> 00:52:54.928
You have the arms of an anaemic
spider monkey. Definitely not you.


678
00:52:55.095 --> 00:52:57.097
Well, Mimi probably
isn't the killer either.


679
00:52:57.264 --> 00:52:59.266
Her only death comes
from a makeup kit.


680
00:52:59.433 --> 00:53:01.143
We can take Toshiba off the list.

681
00:53:01.518 --> 00:53:03.937
- Why?
- Because you're you.


682
00:53:04.688 --> 00:53:06.440
And it's definitely not Claptonia.

683
00:53:06.648 --> 00:53:09.609
Those two couldn't be apart
long enough to coordinate a killing.


684
00:53:09.776 --> 00:53:11.778
That with lone
gnawing through boyfriends...


685
00:53:11.945 --> 00:53:15.198
...like an unfed piranha
makes me think you're both innocent.


686
00:53:15.365 --> 00:53:16.408
Thanks?

687
00:53:16.575 --> 00:53:19.578
You've gone out with, what?
Five guys these past three years?


688
00:53:19.745 --> 00:53:22.831
'90s makeover aside, you're not
reflexive enough to hold a grudge.


689
00:53:22.998 --> 00:53:25.292
And crippling gimpitude
saves your ass.


690
00:53:25.459 --> 00:53:27.753
Having a broken leg is for losers,
you idiot.


691
00:53:28.128 --> 00:53:30.422
All right, then that settles it.
It's Toby T.


692
00:53:30.589 --> 00:53:32.174
- Why is it me?
- Just fess up, Toby.


693
00:53:32.340 --> 00:53:35.635
So I can get out of here, and won't
have to listen to this windbag.


694
00:53:35.802 --> 00:53:38.430
- Take one for the team.
- You guys barely even know me.


695
00:53:38.597 --> 00:53:39.973
That's kind of the problem.

696
00:53:40.182 --> 00:53:42.642
It writes psychotic killer
all over your face.


697
00:53:43.185 --> 00:53:46.813
Mimi is just too obvious
with the rebellious clown makeup...


698
00:53:46.980 --> 00:53:50.317
-...her hippie parents hate.
- My parents aren't hippies.


699
00:53:50.484 --> 00:53:52.611
- Are you all assholes?
- I'm not.


700
00:53:52.778 --> 00:53:55.655
Look, guys, it's obvious
I have no ties to Billy and Taylor.


701
00:53:55.822 --> 00:53:57.324
Same school, same food chain.

702
00:53:57.491 --> 00:53:59.826
How could you,
strange, unknown quiet guy?


703
00:53:59.993 --> 00:54:01.995
I'm not a killer, 
I'm just boring.

704
00:54:02.162 --> 00:54:03.663
Toby, you're right.

705
00:54:03.830 --> 00:54:07.334
It can't be any of us.
We're not anguished enough.


706
00:54:07.501 --> 00:54:09.795
Our generation has had
no major struggles.


707
00:54:09.961 --> 00:54:11.588
- What about 9/11?
- Afghanistan?


708
00:54:11.755 --> 00:54:12.839
- Iraq.
- Katrina.


709
00:54:13.006 --> 00:54:14.925
Heath Ledger. What?

710
00:54:15.091 --> 00:54:16.134
Too soon?

711
00:54:16.676 --> 00:54:19.304
The hell do Katrina <i>&</i> the Waves
have to do with it'?


712
00:54:19.471 --> 00:54:22.182
Katrina the hurricane.
Wikipedia it, bitch.


713
00:54:22.349 --> 00:54:26.603
It's spelled "encyclopaedia," slutbag.

714
00:54:27.521 --> 00:54:29.356
Who's the guy in the hoodie?

715
00:54:30.732 --> 00:54:33.527
My name is Elliot Fink.

716
00:54:33.693 --> 00:54:34.861
I didn't see you.

717
00:54:35.028 --> 00:54:38.031
Nobody really sees me.

718
00:54:38.365 --> 00:54:42.452
I've had detention every day
for the last 19 years.


719
00:54:42.619 --> 00:54:44.538
Nineteen years?
The hell did you do?


720
00:54:44.704 --> 00:54:48.834
I... I don't remember.

721
00:56:23.720 --> 00:56:26.389
Took a dump on the windshield
of Woodruff's Cadillac.


722
00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:28.308
Only got a week.

723
00:56:28.475 --> 00:56:31.144
You must be the baddest motherfucker
in school.


724
00:56:31.311 --> 00:56:33.772
Now, Elliot Fink,
you're gonna sit here...


725
00:56:33.939 --> 00:56:35.815
...and think about
what you've done.


726
00:56:35.982 --> 00:56:39.653
You'll have detention every day
until I tell you you're reformed.


727
00:56:39.861 --> 00:56:44.407
My school will not be a training ground
for budding pornographers.


728
00:57:02.092 --> 00:57:04.636
Don't look at me, perv.

729
00:57:06.012 --> 00:57:08.640
Can I get a Wi
-Fi connection here?

730
00:57:10.350 --> 00:57:12.519
'Nam flashback?

731
00:57:13.436 --> 00:57:15.355
Did you go to this school in 1992?

732
00:57:15.522 --> 00:57:18.525
Yeah, she'll be 65 next week.
It's a surgical wonder.


733
00:57:27.867 --> 00:57:30.996
Apparently, a perfect body
and eyeliner aren't enough...


734
00:57:31.162 --> 00:57:32.622
...to win the school dance-off.

735
00:57:32.789 --> 00:57:36.918
You need, like, moves and things.
God!


736
00:57:38.795 --> 00:57:42.340
I used to know how to break it down
like C+C Music Factory.


737
00:57:42.507 --> 00:57:43.675
Yeah, right!

738
00:57:43.842 --> 00:57:46.052
Mom, the dance-off is in two days.

739
00:57:46.219 --> 00:57:49.472
All you need to do is swap minds
with my 18-year-old self.


740
00:57:49.639 --> 00:57:53.727
My mind will go into your mind,
into your body...


741
00:57:53.893 --> 00:57:55.478
...and win you the dance-off.

742
00:57:55.645 --> 00:57:59.399
Meanwhile, your mind
will travel to 1992.


743
00:57:59.566 --> 00:58:02.318
That way people won't wonder
why there's two of you...


744
00:58:02.485 --> 00:58:04.070
...or us, hanging around now.

745
00:58:04.237 --> 00:58:08.241
A couple of things I need to tell you
about boys in 1992.


746
00:58:08.450 --> 00:58:11.536
Christian Slater, 
Frank Whaley...

747
00:58:11.703 --> 00:58:15.081
...oh, and Richard Grieco
are all foxes.


748
00:58:15.248 --> 00:58:17.000
Donnie Wahlberg is bordering sexy.

749
00:58:17.167 --> 00:58:22.047
Oh, and Kevin Costner is slamming
in <i>Prince</i> of Thieves.


750
00:58:22.213 --> 00:58:24.966
Kevin Costner is a douche.
And one other thing...


751
00:58:25.467 --> 00:58:26.593
...are you insane?

752
00:58:26.760 --> 00:58:30.013
It's what I always sang to you
when you were a baby.


753
00:58:30.180 --> 00:58:32.223
<i>When you wish--</i>

754
00:58:32.390 --> 00:58:33.683
Shit!

755
00:58:35.435 --> 00:58:38.730
I wish my mother
would go to another planet...


756
00:58:38.897 --> 00:58:43.109
...instead of being a drunken has-been
who's full of shit.


757
00:59:21.606 --> 00:59:25.985
So that's how my mind ended up
in my mother's body in 1992.


758
00:59:26.152 --> 00:59:30.615
And how I ended up
in my daughter lone in the present.


759
00:59:30.907 --> 00:59:33.618
But that's all technical science stuff.

760
00:59:42.043 --> 00:59:44.337
Wow, lone really did her research.

761
00:59:47.674 --> 00:59:49.634
Next up, doing ballet...

762
00:59:49.801 --> 00:59:52.137
...we have Ripley Jones.

763
00:59:52.303 --> 00:59:53.346
Riley!

764
00:59:53.513 --> 00:59:56.641
Whatever, dude.
You have like three minutes.


765
01:00:16.536 --> 01:00:18.204
You taste like Luke Perry.

766
01:00:21.583 --> 01:00:24.043
- She's a gimp.
- FML!


767
01:00:24.210 --> 01:00:27.172
<i>Every student donating a food item
to help the war victims...</i>


768
01:00:27.338 --> 01:00:29.632
<i>will receive</i> a <i>free pass
to Lethal Weapon 3.</i>


769
01:00:29.799 --> 01:00:32.719
What the heck is so retro
about Kris Kross, dumb-ass?


770
01:00:32.886 --> 01:00:36.556
<i>This week the Science Olympiad
took place in Town Creek.</i>


771
01:00:36.723 --> 01:00:39.976
I am never leaving this place.

772
01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:42.395
This move is sick.

773
01:00:42.562 --> 01:00:44.189
<i>Tighten up that defence line</i>

774
01:00:44.355 --> 01:00:46.482
<i>Said hold that line</i>

775
01:00:46.649 --> 01:00:47.734
This one is...

776
01:00:47.901 --> 01:00:49.903
Oh, hey, Verge,
are you coming out tonight?


777
01:00:50.069 --> 01:00:52.572
We're gonna watch Freejack
on laser disc.


778
01:00:59.412 --> 01:01:03.249
Dear God, please give me the strength
to ask Sloan to prom.


779
01:01:03.416 --> 01:01:08.171
We're meant to be
and she sees the future.


780
01:01:08.421 --> 01:01:12.342
And give some food to those Ethiopian
kids hanging out with Sally Struthers...


781
01:01:12.508 --> 01:01:14.510
...because seeing them
really bums me out...


782
01:01:14.677 --> 01:01:17.639
...during <i>Star Trek: Next Generation.
Amen.</i>


783
01:01:21.226 --> 01:01:22.727
Lose your seat?

784
01:01:23.436 --> 01:01:26.773
No, I was just sitting
right over there.


785
01:01:26.940 --> 01:01:31.277
I saw you in cheerleader practice
in the gym yesterday...


786
01:01:31.444 --> 01:01:34.906
...and I was thinking about it again
in bed last night.


787
01:01:35.698 --> 01:01:39.369
I was just gonna ask you to prom.

788
01:01:40.119 --> 01:01:45.416
I can smell bologna packed
in your lunch. It makes me gag.


789
01:01:50.964 --> 01:01:53.091
You look like a girl!

790
01:01:57.095 --> 01:02:00.014
Sloan probably only likes guys
that look like C. Thomas Howell.


791
01:02:00.181 --> 01:02:03.142
Well, that's just
racial discrimination.


792
01:02:03.309 --> 01:02:06.896
If I can't be part of her future,
there will be no future.


793
01:02:19.492 --> 01:02:20.994
Damn it.

794
01:02:21.577 --> 01:02:25.581
Well, if I'm gonna die, at least I know
I've lived twice as long as Riley.


795
01:02:25.748 --> 01:02:28.501
Just because you're a bitch
doesn't give you dog years.


796
01:02:28.668 --> 01:02:31.004
Says the baby with the stuffed toys.

797
01:02:37.302 --> 01:02:39.637
I think it's Taylor's.

798
01:02:40.847 --> 01:02:44.642
Verge is right.
The killer's right here.


799
01:02:46.686 --> 01:02:49.689
We gotta find out what happens
after the Cinderhella murders.


800
01:02:49.856 --> 01:02:52.525
- Cinderhella dies.
- Yeah, after that.


801
01:02:52.692 --> 01:02:54.694
<i>What happens in
Cinderhella Ill: Blood Ball?</i>


802
01:02:54.861 --> 01:02:57.363
- Movie's not out yet.
- I'll BitTorrent the work print.


803
01:02:57.530 --> 01:02:58.698
Three, two-
- Got it!

804
01:02:58.865 --> 01:03:01.367
Damn. The review
by Sherlock Moriarty...


805
01:03:01.534 --> 01:03:03.536
...compares it unfavourably
to Hellboy ll...


806
01:03:03.703 --> 01:03:05.538
...calling it a "craptasterpiece."

807
01:03:05.747 --> 01:03:07.290
That's it.

808
01:03:14.297 --> 01:03:17.342
<i>If Mr. Pain's giving us detention
on a Saturday...</i>


809
01:03:17.508 --> 01:03:20.887
...the <i>least</i> we can do is download
Slashing Beauty 4 for free...


810
01:03:21.054 --> 01:03:24.223
<i>...and watch it illegally on the Internet
before it's released.</i>


811
01:03:24.390 --> 01:03:26.392
<i>I wanna have unprotected sex.</i>

812
01:03:26.559 --> 01:03:29.562
<i>How can they make a movie worse
than Cinderhella ll?</i>


813
01:03:38.404 --> 01:03:41.574
<i>They say the Beauty Beast
only kills virgins.</i>


814
01:03:42.325 --> 01:03:44.077
<i>I'm saving myself for marriage.</i>

815
01:03:44.535 --> 01:03:46.537
<i>I avoid teenage pregnancy.</i>

816
01:03:49.749 --> 01:03:53.503
<i>Madison. We're gonna die.</i>

817
01:03:53.669 --> 01:03:55.254
<i>If it's life or death...</i>

818
01:03:56.422 --> 01:03:59.258
- What is this, Canadian?
- Canada invented the slasher film...


819
01:03:59.425 --> 01:04:02.762
...as well as the "animal plays a sport"
genre, motherfucker.


820
01:04:03.096 --> 01:04:04.305
<i>I'm a virgin.</i>

821
01:04:11.854 --> 01:04:13.773
<i>Take me, Beauty Beast!</i>

822
01:04:13.940 --> 01:04:16.025
<i>Your teeth are so hard!</i>

823
01:04:17.443 --> 01:04:18.611
<i>Suck it!</i>

824
01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:20.405
<i>Goddamn it!</i>

825
01:04:21.114 --> 01:04:23.449
<i>Greg, you asshole.</i>

<i>Now we really do have to use

827
01:04:31.124 --> 01:04:33.042
<i>This movie is so stupid.</i>

828
01:04:33.209 --> 01:04:35.962
<i>Let's go back to class
and fall asleep.</i>


829
01:04:37.797 --> 01:04:40.633
<i>None of you felons...</i>

830
01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:45.555
<i>will ever graduate!</i>

831
01:04:53.855 --> 01:04:56.065
What is this commotion?

832
01:04:56.232 --> 01:05:01.446
- We're about to get murdered.
- Someday you will be old, kids.


833
01:05:01.612 --> 01:05:04.782
Do you believe that our president,
Barack Obama, murdered anyone...


834
01:05:04.949 --> 01:05:07.076
...when he was in high school?

835
01:05:08.327 --> 01:05:10.746
O.J. maybe. Not Obama.

836
01:05:10.913 --> 01:05:13.749
- I think that's racist, sir.
- What is? It is not.


837
01:05:13.916 --> 01:05:17.837
Why did you go from Obama to O.J.
instead of to Dahmer or someone?


838
01:05:18.004 --> 01:05:22.341
I, Mimi, am the principal
of this school...


839
01:05:22.508 --> 01:05:25.511
...and you have not even completed
your schooling.


840
01:05:26.137 --> 01:05:27.680
Besides, I voted for McCain.

841
01:05:27.847 --> 01:05:30.892
In conclusion, stop fucking around.

842
01:05:31.350 --> 01:05:33.519
- Are we allowed to read?
- No, Hitachi.


843
01:05:33.811 --> 01:05:34.854
Toshiba.

844
01:05:35.021 --> 01:05:37.190
Lone. Sorry, baby.

845
01:05:37.398 --> 01:05:38.858
-"Baby"?
- Weird.


846
01:05:39.609 --> 01:05:40.985
Who is that?

847
01:05:41.194 --> 01:05:42.862
My name's Elliot Fink.

848
01:05:43.029 --> 01:05:44.822
Nobody say a word.
Nobody sneeze.


849
01:05:45.198 --> 01:05:49.494
Nobody look at anything
except your own eyeballs.


850
01:05:50.703 --> 01:05:52.163
There's a killer amongst us.

851
01:05:53.539 --> 01:05:55.708
<i>You've read Brave New World.</i>

852
01:05:55.875 --> 01:05:58.336
Like Big Brother, 
I'm watching you.

853
01:05:58.503 --> 01:05:59.712
Big Brother was in 1984.

854
01:05:59.921 --> 01:06:05.218
You have no future in my opinion.

855
01:06:09.889 --> 01:06:11.015
What now?

856
01:06:11.182 --> 01:06:14.227
These kids should be happy to be
away from their Yu-Gi-Oh.


857
01:06:14.393 --> 01:06:17.230
What the hell are you doing
out of detention?


858
01:06:28.407 --> 01:06:29.909
I solved the equation.

859
01:06:30.076 --> 01:06:33.412
Cool. You passed Trig. In other news,
somebody's murdering us.


860
01:06:33.579 --> 01:06:34.664
None of that matters.

861
01:06:34.830 --> 01:06:38.000
If these numbers are correct,
the world is ending in 10 minutes.


862
01:06:38.167 --> 01:06:41.254
- The whole world?
- Yeah, all of Grizzly Lake.


863
01:06:41.420 --> 01:06:44.215
- That's not the whole world.
- You been outside Grizzly Lake?


864
01:06:44.382 --> 01:06:45.758
- No.
- What's the difference?


865
01:06:45.967 --> 01:06:47.009
Whoa-kay.

866
01:06:47.176 --> 01:06:49.262
Nobody knows who you are.
Why believe you?


867
01:06:49.470 --> 01:06:51.597
In 9.4 minutes,
everyone you know...


868
01:06:52.598 --> 01:06:55.184
...your friends, your parents...

869
01:06:55.351 --> 01:06:58.563
...your extensions, goes bye-bye.

870
01:06:58.729 --> 01:07:00.523
This destruction is man-made.

871
01:07:00.856 --> 01:07:04.527
If it's man-made, we can kill it.

872
01:07:04.694 --> 01:07:08.614
Score one for Captain 9021-Obvious.
How do we stop it?


873
01:07:09.115 --> 01:07:12.451
That's the catch. I said it was
happening in nine minutes...


874
01:07:12.618 --> 01:07:15.705
...but it's happening in nine minutes
in the year 1992.


875
01:07:15.871 --> 01:07:16.914
What the hell?

876
01:07:17.707 --> 01:07:20.459
Somebody must have
gone back to 1992.


877
01:07:20.626 --> 01:07:24.422
In nine minutes, they're changing
history by blowing everything up.


878
01:07:24.589 --> 01:07:26.299
None of you will have
even been born.


879
01:07:26.465 --> 01:07:28.718
- The end of the world's coming?
- Yeah.


880
01:07:28.884 --> 01:07:30.720
- In 1992?
- Yes!


881
01:07:30.886 --> 01:07:32.972
-1992.
- We're talking time travel?


882
01:07:33.139 --> 01:07:36.142
- There's no such thing.
- Technically it's a temporal Wormhole...


883
01:07:36.309 --> 01:07:39.645
...based on an 11-dimensional string
model of the holographic universe.


884
01:07:39.812 --> 01:07:42.440
It'd require a highly advanced
mathematical construct...


885
01:07:42.607 --> 01:07:43.983
...far beyond M-theory...

886
01:07:44.150 --> 01:07:46.569
...probably alien in origin.

887
01:07:48.154 --> 01:07:49.572
What?

888
01:07:49.739 --> 01:07:53.117
I've been building the school bear
into a time machine for science class.


889
01:07:53.284 --> 01:07:56.579
So you're telling me it works? Cool.

890
01:07:56.746 --> 01:07:58.164
I hate this school.

891
01:07:58.497 --> 01:07:59.832
Where's Sander?

892
01:07:59.999 --> 01:08:01.542
And Clapton.

893
01:08:02.001 --> 01:08:05.004
He's terrified of the future.
Nobody hated Verge like Clapton.


894
01:08:05.171 --> 01:08:07.757
Clapton doesn't hate anyone
except Billy Nolan.


895
01:08:07.923 --> 01:08:09.258
Also dead.

896
01:08:09.425 --> 01:08:10.801
Oh, shit.

897
01:08:11.052 --> 01:08:14.680
I'll drop my extreme scepticism due to
the potential urgency of the situation.


898
01:08:14.847 --> 01:08:18.184
- How do we use your time machine?
- You'll break it.


899
01:08:18.351 --> 01:08:21.020
- I haven't been graded yet.
- You won't be graded at all...


900
01:08:21.187 --> 01:08:24.357
...if you haven't been born.
Show me how it works.


901
01:08:24.565 --> 01:08:27.818
No, show me.
I don't trust anyone right now.


902
01:08:27.985 --> 01:08:29.362
Maybe we don't trust you.

903
01:08:29.528 --> 01:08:33.532
It's personal.
I have to stop Clapton from killing us.


904
01:08:33.699 --> 01:08:36.702
Someone took this claw
from my locker.


905
01:09:01.727 --> 01:09:04.397
I'm sorry. But this is so cool.

906
01:09:04.605 --> 01:09:06.065
How much did those cost?

907
01:09:06.816 --> 01:09:08.067
A hundred dollars.

908
01:09:08.234 --> 01:09:09.652
For overalls?

909
01:09:09.819 --> 01:09:13.239
Did your parents sell out
to an evil corporate conglomerate?


910
01:09:15.366 --> 01:09:17.660
I'm never leaving this place.

911
01:09:46.021 --> 01:09:48.774
- Schwing!
- Schwing!


912
01:09:50.693 --> 01:09:52.945
That's why Mom left you.

913
01:09:58.743 --> 01:10:02.621
Okay, class, we talked last week
about quantum states.


914
01:10:02.788 --> 01:10:08.294
Now, can anybody tell me
what describes a mixed state?


915
01:10:08.461 --> 01:10:10.963
- New Mexico.
- No, Clapton.


916
01:10:11.130 --> 01:10:14.467
You already received your 15 percent
for participation mark.


917
01:10:14.633 --> 01:10:17.470
You don't have to give
the wrong answers anymore.


918
01:10:17.678 --> 01:10:20.389
But nice work on your essay
on the Heisenberg principle.


919
01:10:20.556 --> 01:10:23.476
It was incorrect but it had heart.

920
01:10:23.642 --> 01:10:25.436
I gave you an A.

921
01:10:26.145 --> 01:10:28.147
He's a killer!

922
01:10:28.564 --> 01:10:30.149
I don't know this person.

923
01:10:30.316 --> 01:10:33.569
My class time will not be spent
on practical jokes.


924
01:10:33.736 --> 01:10:36.071
Clapton Davis is
my brightest student.


925
01:10:36.238 --> 01:10:39.658
Brightest?
He never does his homework.


926
01:10:39.825 --> 01:10:42.995
We figured it out, Clapton.
All this death is just a game to you.


927
01:10:43.162 --> 01:10:46.332
Why would I kill people? I chased
Sander through the time machine...


928
01:10:46.499 --> 01:10:49.335
...after he got Gord, lost him.
Been stuck here for six weeks.


929
01:10:49.502 --> 01:10:52.505
- But I'm on the honour roll.
- So then why does the world go away?


930
01:10:52.671 --> 01:10:54.632
Wait, is that why Verge
is building a bomb?


931
01:10:54.799 --> 01:10:56.675
- A bomb?
- Thought he was extra-crediting.


932
01:10:56.842 --> 01:10:58.636
In Osama bin Ladinism?

933
01:10:58.803 --> 01:11:00.596
I bet Sander's helping him.

934
01:11:00.846 --> 01:11:03.349
Unbelievable. You let
a mass murderer feel your bosom.


935
01:11:03.516 --> 01:11:06.519
Oh, my God.
We have to kill Sander.


936
01:11:06.685 --> 01:11:09.980
What are we, monsters?
Let's just kidnap him.


937
01:11:12.608 --> 01:11:15.528
And scene. Thank you.

938
01:11:15.694 --> 01:11:16.946
Shit!

939
01:11:19.031 --> 01:11:21.826
If time travel were to happen,
it would probably require...


940
01:11:21.992 --> 01:11:26.539
...a huge electrical force
of around 1.21, 1.22 gigawatts.


941
01:11:26.705 --> 01:11:31.001
See how crossing the nodes of your ﬂux
capacitor generates a tachyon blast?


942
01:11:31.168 --> 01:11:33.629
I don't know who you are
or what you're trying--


943
01:11:33.796 --> 01:11:36.298
The way this is set up,
it's gonna blow your face off.


944
01:11:36.465 --> 01:11:37.967
Yeah, I'd like to see that.

945
01:11:38.133 --> 01:11:41.387
You defy death and turn into
a douche bag like Spock.


946
01:11:41.637 --> 01:11:43.889
Here, I made you a mix tape.

947
01:11:44.056 --> 01:11:45.349
That's so awesome.

948
01:11:46.725 --> 01:11:50.855
- Are you from, like, the year 2000?
- Yes, I come from the time where...


949
01:11:51.021 --> 01:11:53.440
...computers and machines
have overtaken the world...


950
01:11:53.607 --> 01:11:57.027
...and enslaved human bodies
as sources of infinite electrical power.


951
01:11:58.195 --> 01:12:00.030
That's stupid.
The food it would take--


952
01:12:00.197 --> 01:12:02.825
If you're not careful,
you'll create a chain of events...


953
01:12:02.992 --> 01:12:05.911
...leading to the complete annihilation
of the human race.


954
01:12:06.078 --> 01:12:09.999
Now make that bomb go off.

955
01:12:10.332 --> 01:12:12.918
I wanna kill everyone because
they snubbed me for prom.


956
01:12:13.085 --> 01:12:15.004
- That works.
- I like how you think, Mr...?


957
01:12:15.170 --> 01:12:17.423
Keanu.

958
01:12:19.091 --> 01:12:20.926
Excuse me.
Where is your hall pass?


959
01:12:21.093 --> 01:12:23.429
- Gosh-fucking-darn it.
- You get his legs.


960
01:12:27.057 --> 01:12:29.435
- Oh, my face!
- It didn't work.


961
01:12:31.937 --> 01:12:33.022
Don't be so sure.

962
01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:36.066
Come on!

963
01:13:12.144 --> 01:13:13.979
Riley, get back in the time machine.

964
01:13:28.160 --> 01:13:30.454
We've been sent back
six minutes before doomsday.


965
01:13:30.621 --> 01:13:32.081
We should have grabbed Verge.

966
01:13:32.247 --> 01:13:35.000
He had enough info to know
how to make the bomb go off.


967
01:13:35.167 --> 01:13:36.502
- New strategy.
- What?


968
01:13:36.669 --> 01:13:39.004
I don't know.
I'm saying we need one.


969
01:13:47.346 --> 01:13:48.847
I got nothing.

970
01:13:51.517 --> 01:13:56.522
If we weren't all dead in two minutes,
I would masturbate so hard...


971
01:13:56.689 --> 01:13:59.775
-...to lone tonight.
-lone? You mean Sloan.


972
01:14:00.859 --> 01:14:04.613
Girls like Sloan will learn what happens
when they pass up guys like me.


973
01:14:07.199 --> 01:14:08.534
Let me see your bomb.

974
01:14:09.201 --> 01:14:10.536
- That's it.
- What's what?


975
01:14:10.703 --> 01:14:14.873
Verge is doing this because she broke
his heart. We force lone to go with him.


976
01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:17.126
Lone's going to prom with me.
Forget it.


977
01:14:17.292 --> 01:14:20.879
She'll go to prom with you in 2011
and with him in 1992.


978
01:14:21.046 --> 01:14:23.298
Yeah, I still don't think
I'm okay with that.


979
01:14:23.966 --> 01:14:25.134
Lone!

980
01:14:27.553 --> 01:14:30.889
You'll blow this for me.
I traded places with my mom.


981
01:14:31.056 --> 01:14:32.349
My name here is Sloan.

982
01:14:35.561 --> 01:14:37.021
Don't I get a kiss?

983
01:14:37.730 --> 01:14:39.023
No.

984
01:14:39.189 --> 01:14:41.150
Damn, I knew Sting
was too good to be true.


985
01:14:41.316 --> 01:14:43.652
- Your mom's a bitch.
- It was to win the contest.


986
01:14:43.819 --> 01:14:46.530
- I was gonna come back but--
- Being cool is that important?


987
01:14:46.697 --> 01:14:49.366
How hard is it
to be cool in 1992?

988
01:14:49.533 --> 01:14:53.037
Plus, my mom's body fits great,
except...


989
01:14:53.203 --> 01:14:55.873
...I think I may be pregnant.

990
01:14:57.249 --> 01:14:59.168
Lone's giving birth to herself?

991
01:14:59.334 --> 01:15:00.753
I failed that class.

992
01:15:00.919 --> 01:15:04.506
You know how cool people
always refer to guacamole as "guac"?


993
01:15:04.673 --> 01:15:07.426
- I invented that.
-lone, you have to ask Verge to prom.


994
01:15:07.593 --> 01:15:09.762
Waiting for the punch line.

995
01:15:09.928 --> 01:15:13.348
People are getting killed. He's gonna
blow up Grizzly Lake in 56 seconds.


996
01:15:13.515 --> 01:15:15.434
You can keep living in 1992
if you want...


997
01:15:15.601 --> 01:15:18.270
...but the fate of everyone
you've ever known goes away...


998
01:15:18.479 --> 01:15:20.439
...unless you ask Verge to prom
right now.


999
01:15:20.606 --> 01:15:24.109
Screw that! I can't be forced
to go to prom with someone.


1000
01:15:24.276 --> 01:15:26.445
That's like date rape.

1001
01:15:26.612 --> 01:15:28.614
You heard of
the Dead Cheerleader Nationals?


1002
01:15:28.947 --> 01:15:30.741
They don't exist.

1003
01:15:30.908 --> 01:15:32.951
Verge, I was wondering...

1004
01:15:33.368 --> 01:15:35.120
What are you guys working on?

1005
01:15:35.287 --> 01:15:37.039
Now, lone. Eighteen seconds!

1006
01:15:37.206 --> 01:15:40.209
- Will you be my prom date?
- Your hair can look like Sharon Stone?


1007
01:15:40.375 --> 01:15:41.418
- What?
- What are you doing?


1008
01:15:41.585 --> 01:15:42.878
- Fine!
- Nine seconds.


1009
01:15:43.045 --> 01:15:45.130
- You go full tongue?
- Okay.


1010
01:15:45.297 --> 01:15:46.590
Cowabunga.

1011
01:15:47.299 --> 01:15:49.384
We can use my
Pizza Pitt coupons first.


1012
01:16:02.815 --> 01:16:04.733
Weren't we able to jump through
last time?


1013
01:16:04.900 --> 01:16:07.444
We surpassed the spatial
temporal limit of time travel.


1014
01:16:07.611 --> 01:16:09.321
What is that?
You just made that up.


1015
01:16:09.488 --> 01:16:11.573
Toshiba must have put
an on-off switch here.


1016
01:16:11.740 --> 01:16:13.951
Let's see.

1017
01:16:16.453 --> 01:16:17.955
Found it

1018
01:16:22.292 --> 01:16:24.503
Come on!

1019
01:16:24.670 --> 01:16:27.172
That girl is going down on that bear.

1020
01:16:27.339 --> 01:16:30.342
- Come on!
- I knew that ass looked familiar.


1021
01:16:31.844 --> 01:16:34.263
- Come on, you bitch!
- Nice.


1022
01:16:36.557 --> 01:16:37.766
Who's her prom date?

1023
01:16:38.600 --> 01:16:40.769
All his parts are still working.

1024
01:16:40.936 --> 01:16:42.855
- Yeah, we gotta go.
- Come on.


1025
01:16:46.567 --> 01:16:48.694
Not so fast.

1026
01:16:48.861 --> 01:16:49.862
Oh, crap.

1027
01:17:12.384 --> 01:17:15.304
So everyone left detention
after Verge and Gord got killed?


1028
01:17:15.470 --> 01:17:18.891
Our band may not be the Drunges,
but I wouldn't say we got killed.


1029
01:17:19.057 --> 01:17:21.727
Oh, Principal Pimping,
don't listen to the haters.


1030
01:17:21.894 --> 01:17:23.854
You are my freakasaurus.

1031
01:17:24.855 --> 01:17:28.901
Since our lead vocalist is too busy
getting molested by Mrs. Verge...


1032
01:17:29.067 --> 01:17:31.528
I quit, I quit, 
I'm too wasted.

1033
01:17:31.695 --> 01:17:33.572
<i>Verge! Verge! Verge!</i>

1034
01:17:33.739 --> 01:17:37.576
I guess I'll sing the next song.
This one goes out to lone.


1035
01:17:37.743 --> 01:17:41.747
Because, lone,
you are my field of gold.


1036
01:17:41.914 --> 01:17:43.624
Hit it, Gord.

1037
01:17:46.835 --> 01:17:50.839
Toby T knows every
post-Police Sting album.


1038
01:17:53.258 --> 01:17:56.136
We changed the fabric
of space-time.


1039
01:17:56.345 --> 01:17:59.556
That or the bear fumes
have gotten me delusional.


1040
01:18:03.435 --> 01:18:07.272
- An A. That should do it.
- Verge!


1041
01:18:08.523 --> 01:18:10.400
Nineteen years ago today...

1042
01:18:10.567 --> 01:18:13.570
...I met the kindest man
I could ever imagine.


1043
01:18:13.737 --> 01:18:16.114
Who gave you the right to get
so much older than me?


1044
01:18:16.281 --> 01:18:19.368
Strange things happen
when you're young.


1045
01:18:19.534 --> 01:18:22.955
No! The punch bowl has been spiked.
You will not drink that, young lady.


1046
01:18:23.121 --> 01:18:25.666
Don't talk to me that way,
young lady.


1047
01:18:26.250 --> 01:18:30.170
All right, lovebirds. I'm gonna steal
my hottie and grab some guac.


1048
01:18:31.296 --> 01:18:32.464
Guac.

1049
01:18:32.631 --> 01:18:35.133
And the world just threw up a little.

1050
01:18:35.300 --> 01:18:38.303
-"Lovebirds"? Are we dating now?
- You got a problem with that?


1051
01:18:38.470 --> 01:18:39.805
Students.

1052
01:18:39.972 --> 01:18:44.810
I hate to interrupt but it is now time to
announce your prom king and queen.


1053
01:18:44.977 --> 01:18:46.979
Oh, you all know what the deal is.

1054
01:18:47.145 --> 01:18:48.730
Riley, Clapton...

1055
01:18:49.982 --> 01:18:52.192
...come on up here and dance.

1056
01:18:54.319 --> 01:18:55.654
- Clapton don't da--
- Shut up.


1057
01:18:55.821 --> 01:18:58.824
If you don't dance with me,
I will murder every last inch of you.


1058
01:18:59.116 --> 01:19:02.327
Well, in that case,
hold on a second.


1059
01:19:05.914 --> 01:19:06.999
Clapton don't dance.

1060
01:19:07.833 --> 01:19:09.918
So they say.
But when studying Road House...


1061
01:19:10.085 --> 01:19:12.629
...I got hooked on the rest
of Patrick Swayze's oeuvre.


1062
01:19:12.796 --> 01:19:15.007
If he can look cool dirty dancing...

1063
01:21:03.949 --> 01:21:06.618
ls everything really back to normal?

1064
01:21:07.702 --> 01:21:12.374
I guess if me getting an A and saving
the universe is considered normal.


1065
01:21:13.417 --> 01:21:18.213
Well, maybe normal's
not all it's cracked up to be.


1066
01:21:33.645 --> 01:21:34.980
We didn't change everything.

1067
01:21:56.001 --> 01:21:58.753
I mean, look at how tight
his jeans are.


1068
01:21:59.463 --> 01:22:01.756
- He's totally gay.
- Oh, you piece of shit!


1069
01:22:01.923 --> 01:22:04.843
You should have fucked me.

1070
01:22:07.888 --> 01:22:10.182
Think you can kill people
because you're a virgin?


1071
01:22:10.348 --> 01:22:12.434
That's the douchiest thing
I've ever heard.


1072
01:22:12.601 --> 01:22:16.021
Sander, I want my fish sticks.

1073
01:22:16.688 --> 01:22:17.814
Hey!

1074
01:22:17.981 --> 01:22:19.774
I stopped wearing Ed Hardy
junior year.


1075
01:22:19.941 --> 01:22:24.112
I'm sorry that you're all too busy
playing Sims Grizzly Lake to notice!


1076
01:22:24.279 --> 01:22:28.033
- Christian Audigier is the same shit.
- Really? Whatever.


1077
01:22:28.200 --> 01:22:30.869
- You're all Gossip Girls with Corollas!
- I take the bus.


1078
01:22:31.036 --> 01:22:34.956
And like wearing a movie mask
is so original.


1079
01:22:35.123 --> 01:22:36.541
Read a book.

1080
01:22:36.708 --> 01:22:39.377
It's called post-irony!

1081
01:22:39.544 --> 01:22:42.714
I used to think you were just some
middle-class chump with no game.


1082
01:22:42.881 --> 01:22:44.508
But those pity points ran out.

1083
01:22:44.966 --> 01:22:50.889
Oh, pity me from the wrist-slitting
herbivore over here?


1084
01:22:53.141 --> 01:22:54.893
"Clapton Davis doesn't love me.

1085
01:22:55.060 --> 01:22:57.687
Please kill me, God!"

1086
01:22:57.854 --> 01:22:59.981
You are pathetic!

1087
01:23:00.148 --> 01:23:03.235
All of your Grizzly Lake friends
are pathetic!


1088
01:23:05.737 --> 01:23:07.197
Except me. I'm all right.

1089
01:23:07.364 --> 01:23:09.741
God, why wasn't I born
someplace cool, like Orlando?


1090
01:23:10.158 --> 01:23:11.243
God, you're a dick.

1091
01:23:11.576 --> 01:23:15.080
It breaks my spirit to see that bra size
wasted on someone like you.


1092
01:23:23.922 --> 01:23:26.258
You're about to be spanked
by the power of Swayze.


1093
01:23:26.424 --> 01:23:28.426
All Road House had were his fists.

1094
01:23:28.593 --> 01:23:31.846
In Under <i>Siege,</i>
Steven Seagal was a master chef.


1095
01:23:52.784 --> 01:23:54.536
Your fighting style is so obnoxious.

1096
01:23:54.786 --> 01:23:59.583
Seagal in On <i>Deadly</i> Ground.
Impenetrable defence.


1097
01:24:35.243 --> 01:24:37.537
Oh, God!

1098
01:24:52.636 --> 01:24:54.179
I got you.

1099
01:24:54.346 --> 01:24:55.972
You got yourself.

1100
01:25:28.046 --> 01:25:31.675
Just another dead teenager
in Grizzly Lake.


1101
01:25:32.634 --> 01:25:35.053
I think he'll be the last.

1102
01:25:52.237 --> 01:25:55.740
<i>Once upon a time,
the planet didn't burst into flames...</i>


1103
01:25:55.907 --> 01:25:59.077
<i>...everybody didn't die,
and life kept on...</i>


1104
01:25:59.244 --> 01:26:02.706
<i>...even though Sander thought that
he was the only one who mattered.</i>


1105
01:26:02.872 --> 01:26:04.708
<i>But every one of us was...</i>

1106
01:26:07.252 --> 01:26:09.254
<i>...a prince...</i>

1107
01:26:15.135 --> 01:26:16.386
<i>...a princess...</i>

1108
01:26:22.267 --> 01:26:24.102
<i>...a child...</i>

1109
01:26:29.691 --> 01:26:30.734
<i>...a grown-up-~</i>

1110
01:26:34.446 --> 01:26:36.573
<i>...someone cool.</i>

1111
01:26:38.950 --> 01:26:41.453
If you and Verge can't get home
at a reasonable hour...


1112
01:26:41.661 --> 01:26:43.705
...there's no Twitter for a month.

1113
01:26:43.872 --> 01:26:46.458
Oh, that's so unfair.

1114
01:26:46.666 --> 01:26:49.711
You're gonna let your daughter
ground you like that?


1115
01:26:49.878 --> 01:26:51.963
<i>Yeah, good luck with that.</i>

1116
01:26:56.885 --> 01:27:00.805
<i>Sander saw no future for us
because he lived in the past.</i>


1117
01:27:02.056 --> 01:27:04.267
<i>So his experiment
was to end time itself.</i>


1118
01:27:06.603 --> 01:27:08.605
<i>But we now know
the greatest experiment...</i>


1119
01:27:08.772 --> 01:27:12.150
<i>isn't travelling through time
or making bombs.</i>


1120
01:27:18.323 --> 01:27:20.116
<i>The only way to change the past...</i>

1121
01:27:22.994 --> 01:27:24.329
<i>...is to change the present.</i>

1122
01:27:24.496 --> 01:27:29.709
So Sander was wrong. Even if
Grizzly Lake is lame, it's just a start.


1123
01:27:29.959 --> 01:27:32.295
A beginning, not an end.

1124
01:27:32.462 --> 01:27:36.466
And... And...

1125
01:27:37.634 --> 01:27:39.928
I can't think to this song.

1126
01:27:47.936 --> 01:27:51.189
<i>We're live in Grizzly Lake
where what appears to be a UFO...</i>


1127
01:27:51.356 --> 01:27:54.025
<i>...is descending
on a suburban commun--</i>


1128
01:27:54.526 --> 01:27:57.695
<i>I am a spokesman for the race alien
to your planet Earth.</i>


1129
01:27:57.862 --> 01:28:02.033
<i>First, we assimilated Canada and I
took the exact form of a Canadian.</i>


1130
01:28:02.200 --> 01:28:04.202
<i>I am part of a vegetable species.</i>

1131
01:28:04.369 --> 01:28:06.538
<i>You stupid humans
eat our sons and daughters...</i>


1132
01:28:06.704 --> 01:28:08.498
<i>...because you have
no self-confidence.</i>


1133
01:28:08.998 --> 01:28:13.002
<i>It's just high school.
It's not the end of the world.</i>
