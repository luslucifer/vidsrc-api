1
00:00:49.542 --> 00:00:50.910
- Good evening, Mrs. Hicks.

2
00:00:50.943 --> 00:00:54.780
I'm calling about invoice number

3
00:00:54.814 --> 00:00:58.651
There's a balance due
of $365 and 17 cents.


4
00:00:59.685 --> 00:01:02.253
We sent a copy in the
envelope with your order.


5
00:01:02.287 --> 00:01:03.589
Did you receive your order?

6
00:01:06.892 --> 00:01:09.327
I do have your PO number right
here.


7
00:01:09.361 --> 00:01:11.429
It's 137..

8
00:01:13.198 --> 00:01:14.165
I'm sorry to hear that.

9
00:01:14.199 --> 00:01:16.234
But I'm gonna have to
report to my supervisor


10
00:01:16.267 --> 00:01:17.535
and let him know your intentions

11
00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.372
in regards to this past due
invoice.


12
00:01:25.878 --> 00:01:28.714
Well you have until the

13
00:01:29.949 --> 00:01:31.550
Wait, Mrs. Hicks?

14
00:01:33.853 --> 00:01:35.487
Can I ask you a question?

15
00:01:38.256 --> 00:01:41.694
How long have you lived in
Denver?


16
00:01:43.763 --> 00:01:44.630
Really?

17
00:01:46.264 --> 00:01:47.532
Wow, that's a long time.

18
00:01:50.703 --> 00:01:53.438
Don't you ever feel like you
just wanna...


19
00:01:54.707 --> 00:01:55.708
leave?

20
00:02:11.356 --> 00:02:12.424
Just let me do it.

21
00:02:14.526 --> 00:02:15.661
- Here you go.

22
00:02:35.581 --> 00:02:37.783
I don't think I'll be coming
over anymore.


23
00:03:32.004 --> 00:03:33.404
- Oh fuck.

24
00:03:34.774 --> 00:03:36.407
Do you think that maybe you can

25
00:03:38.476 --> 00:03:39.410
just turn it back on

26
00:03:39.444 --> 00:03:40.646
for tonight and I can literally

27
00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:41.614
come in tomorrow morning

28
00:03:41.647 --> 00:03:43.448
with a check for you guys or?

29
00:03:55.861 --> 00:03:56.796
Okay. All right.

30
00:03:56.829 --> 00:03:57.663
Well, thank you.

31
00:03:57.696 --> 00:03:58.964
Thank you for your help.

32
00:04:14.146 --> 00:04:15.014
Hey Kenny.

33
00:04:19.552 --> 00:04:20.385
- Audrey?

34
00:04:20.418 --> 00:04:22.588
- Hey, oh sweet.

35
00:04:22.621 --> 00:04:24.355
- Well I have to talk
to you about something.


36
00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:25.523
- Yeah.

37
00:04:25.558 --> 00:04:26.926
- Kenny's been complaining

38
00:04:26.959 --> 00:04:29.394
about the noise and he said,
okay.


39
00:04:29.427 --> 00:04:31.063
He says that you've been-

40
00:04:31.096 --> 00:04:32.565
- Fornicating?

41
00:04:32.598 --> 00:04:33.632
- That's it.

42
00:04:33.666 --> 00:04:35.901
- I don't think it's gonna
be a problem anymore.


43
00:04:35.935 --> 00:04:36.869
- Glad to hear it.

44
00:05:22.948 --> 00:05:24.482
- Hey mom.

45
00:05:24.515 --> 00:05:26.785
Yeah, things are going really
great.


46
00:05:26.819 --> 00:05:27.686
I just...

47
00:05:30.956 --> 00:05:32.791
I've just been

48
00:05:32.825 --> 00:05:34.560
you know, working and

49
00:05:35.828 --> 00:05:36.695
you know

50
00:05:38.697 --> 00:05:41.600
I'm not seeing anyone right now.

51
00:05:41.634 --> 00:05:42.500
But...

52
00:06:00.518 --> 00:06:01.787
Happy Mother's Day.

53
00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:07.026
- Hello,
call me the regular way.


54
00:06:21.106 --> 00:06:21.974
- This is Teddy

55
00:06:22.007 --> 00:06:25.244
one of our North American
Porcupines.


56
00:06:57.910 --> 00:06:59.545
- You don't do good phone work.

57
00:07:00.579 --> 00:07:01.914
- I disagree.

58
00:07:01.947 --> 00:07:03.048
- That's what it says here.

59
00:07:03.082 --> 00:07:05.584
It says you better not
dealing directly with people.


60
00:07:05.617 --> 00:07:07.586
- But that's not true.

61
00:07:07.619 --> 00:07:09.520
I'm really nice to people.

62
00:07:09.555 --> 00:07:10.956
- I'm sure you are.

63
00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:11.857
I just don't have any-

64
00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:13.025
- What else does it say?

65
00:07:15.127 --> 00:07:16.628
- I'm terribly sorry but

66
00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:20.566
we're gonna have to let you go.

67
00:07:20.599 --> 00:07:23.268
- Okay, cool. Got it.

68
00:07:23.302 --> 00:07:26.171
Thank you so much. You
enjoy your day.


69
00:07:26.205 --> 00:07:27.072
- You too.

70
00:08:25.064 --> 00:08:26.799
- Audrey hey it's
Warren


71
00:08:26.832 --> 00:08:29.635
I'm supposed to call it hang on

72
00:08:29.668 --> 00:08:30.836
Jesus I know

73
00:08:30.869 --> 00:08:32.671
If you want someone to do
something


74
00:08:32.704 --> 00:08:34.006
you can just say it

75
00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:35.974
and then you can let them do it.

76
00:08:36.008 --> 00:08:37.943
You don't have to keep yelling
at them.


77
00:08:39.011 --> 00:08:40.913
Sorry, I'm sorry Audrey

78
00:08:42.114 --> 00:08:43.082
You have to get the rent

79
00:08:43.115 --> 00:08:46.218
it's normal to do that
and it's really late.


80
00:08:47.152 --> 00:08:48.353
It's Warren, OK bye.

81
00:09:40.305 --> 00:09:43.108
- Okay so, I just
adopted a dog


82
00:09:43.142 --> 00:09:44.443
and I think it's already one

83
00:09:44.476 --> 00:09:47.679
of the best decisions I've ever
made.


84
00:09:47.713 --> 00:09:50.983
We had a sleep over the first
night before I adopted him.


85
00:09:51.016 --> 00:09:53.986
And he's literally the perfect
dog.


86
00:09:56.088 --> 00:09:57.422
- Look at that face

87
00:09:57.456 --> 00:09:59.124
how can you resist?

88
00:09:59.158 --> 00:10:01.727
Surprisingly, there's a lot of
older dogs


89
00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:04.029
who are in need of a
new family to love them.


90
00:10:04.062 --> 00:10:05.864
Most older dogs make wonderful-

91
00:10:30.956 --> 00:10:33.859
- Adoptions create
families.


92
00:10:33.892 --> 00:10:38.197
And the desire for a family
is something we never lose.


93
00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:40.799
No matter how old we are.

94
00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:45.037
Adult adoption is on the rise

95
00:10:45.070 --> 00:10:49.074
and it is creating families
all over the world.


96
00:10:49.808 --> 00:10:53.879
If you're ready to start the
search for your forever family


97
00:10:54.581 --> 00:10:58.417
please visit our website
at adult adoption.


98
00:11:07.793 --> 00:11:11.029
- Hi there, I've never had any
kids.


99
00:11:11.063 --> 00:11:12.998
My wife and I are kind of lonely
here.


100
00:11:13.031 --> 00:11:15.467
And I think it'd be helpful
for us to have someone


101
00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:17.469
it's a funny thing, how it came
about.


102
00:11:17.502 --> 00:11:18.537
We were thinking about going

103
00:11:18.571 --> 00:11:21.473
to the humane society and
picking out an animal.


104
00:11:21.506 --> 00:11:24.977
- The reason why I would
like to adopt somebody is


105
00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:26.546
because I feel it's very
possible


106
00:11:26.579 --> 00:11:30.282
that many of us have been
in families in other lives.


107
00:11:30.315 --> 00:11:32.484
And that it's possible
that we might meet one


108
00:11:32.517 --> 00:11:35.020
of those family members in this
life.


109
00:11:35.053 --> 00:11:37.889
- But I think I could share some
joy


110
00:11:37.923 --> 00:11:42.261
with an adult who maybe has
never had these things either.


111
00:11:42.294 --> 00:11:44.096
If you're an adult who is
looking


112
00:11:44.129 --> 00:11:46.965
for an adoptive mother,
feel free to get in-


113
00:11:57.943 --> 00:11:59.878
- Hi, my name's Audrey.

114
00:11:59.911 --> 00:12:02.514
And I'm looking to be adopted.

115
00:12:02.548 --> 00:12:04.383
It was really nice watching your
video


116
00:12:04.416 --> 00:12:06.285
and I hope that we get to meet.

117
00:12:06.985 --> 00:12:11.056
Wishing you the best
over here by the river.


118
00:12:11.089 --> 00:12:12.224
Thanks. Bye.

119
00:12:14.893 --> 00:12:16.094
- So um

120
00:12:19.131 --> 00:12:20.198
I used to garden.

121
00:12:20.232 --> 00:12:24.870
But I don't anymore because
of the arthritis now.


122
00:12:24.903 --> 00:12:26.438
No not in five years.

123
00:12:28.206 --> 00:12:30.509
- I mean, we have so much in
common.


124
00:12:30.543 --> 00:12:32.210
The music thing for starters

125
00:12:32.244 --> 00:12:34.946
how many people really
like Dixieland Jazz?


126
00:12:37.316 --> 00:12:38.618
I know they say they do but they
don't.


127
00:12:38.651 --> 00:12:41.486
- Actually we don't like jazz at
all.


128
00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:43.021
We're just being polite.

129
00:12:53.465 --> 00:12:56.468
- Wheat toast and some water
please.


130
00:12:59.304 --> 00:13:00.205
- Audrey?

131
00:13:00.238 --> 00:13:01.073
- Ted.

132
00:13:07.045 --> 00:13:08.347
- Is Nancy coming.

133
00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:10.482
- Nancy.

134
00:13:10.515 --> 00:13:11.883
- Your wife?

135
00:13:11.917 --> 00:13:13.251
- Oh, she's parking the car.

136
00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:17.089
- Parking is pretty bad
around here, I guess.


137
00:13:18.558 --> 00:13:20.525
- I'm really excited about this
Audrey.


138
00:13:23.295 --> 00:13:24.196
- I'm excited too.

139
00:13:25.163 --> 00:13:27.532
- So you want a daddy?

140
00:13:48.987 --> 00:13:50.956
- Hello, my name is
Sunny.


141
00:13:50.989 --> 00:13:53.693
I've never had children,
but over the years


142
00:13:53.726 --> 00:13:55.994
I've watched people who do

143
00:13:56.027 --> 00:13:56.895
I've seen

144
00:13:56.928 --> 00:13:59.531
so much misunderstanding in
families.


145
00:14:00.298 --> 00:14:03.703
I think that if parents
can try to understand


146
00:14:03.736 --> 00:14:07.372
that the things they say can
mean so much to their children


147
00:14:07.406 --> 00:14:11.042
even little things can mean
something big.


148
00:14:11.076 --> 00:14:15.113
If I was ever lucky enough to
be a parent, I'd be the kind


149
00:14:15.147 --> 00:14:18.551
of parent who thinks about
what they say to their child.


150
00:14:18.584 --> 00:14:20.051
And is kind.

151
00:14:46.211 --> 00:14:48.447
- Hi Audrey?

152
00:14:50.716 --> 00:14:52.050
I'm Sunny.

153
00:14:52.083 --> 00:14:53.418
- Hi.

154
00:14:53.452 --> 00:14:55.253
- You didn't have to bring
anything.


155
00:14:56.388 --> 00:14:58.223
- Oh we don't have to eat it.

156
00:14:59.257 --> 00:15:01.960
- Come in. It smells good.

157
00:15:03.128 --> 00:15:04.262
- That's the cumin.

158
00:15:19.745 --> 00:15:21.246
- Have a seat.

159
00:15:21.279 --> 00:15:22.514
Would you like some tea?

160
00:15:23.448 --> 00:15:24.550
- I had a
boss once who told me

161
00:15:24.584 --> 00:15:26.619
I should be on medication.

162
00:15:29.822 --> 00:15:31.022
I think he was trying to help.

163
00:15:31.056 --> 00:15:31.757
But I don't know.

164
00:15:32.658 --> 00:15:34.192
- Did you take his advice?

165
00:15:34.226 --> 00:15:36.094
- No, no.

166
00:15:36.127 --> 00:15:38.196
I don't want to mess with my
brain.


167
00:15:47.138 --> 00:15:50.610
Oh, do you mind if I charge my
phone?


168
00:15:50.643 --> 00:15:52.477
- Here, I'll do it for you.

169
00:15:52.511 --> 00:15:53.345
- Thanks.

170
00:15:59.552 --> 00:16:01.019
- What kind of job was it?

171
00:16:02.555 --> 00:16:03.488
- What?

172
00:16:03.522 --> 00:16:05.591
- The one with the boss
and the medication.


173
00:16:06.859 --> 00:16:08.694
- Oh God, I don't even remember

174
00:16:09.829 --> 00:16:11.797
I've had so many jobs.

175
00:16:11.831 --> 00:16:12.798
- You move around?

176
00:16:14.099 --> 00:16:15.066
- I do.

177
00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:16.134
- You're a seeker.

178
00:16:17.737 --> 00:16:19.104
- Time for dinner?

179
00:16:19.839 --> 00:16:22.374
- Otto, this is Audrey.

180
00:16:22.407 --> 00:16:23.809
- Nice to meet you.

181
00:16:23.843 --> 00:16:25.143
- Hmm.

182
00:16:25.176 --> 00:16:26.077
- Words Otto.

183
00:16:27.279 --> 00:16:28.146
- Hello.

184
00:16:32.585 --> 00:16:33.518
What is this?

185
00:16:33.553 --> 00:16:34.386
- Audrey brought it.

186
00:16:34.419 --> 00:16:35.588
Wasn't that nice?

187
00:16:38.156 --> 00:16:39.491
I made spaghetti.

188
00:16:39.524 --> 00:16:40.726
- We will have spaghetti.

189
00:16:41.694 --> 00:16:42.795
Dinner will be ready soon

190
00:16:42.828 --> 00:16:44.529
Otto why don't you tell Mutti.

191
00:16:44.564 --> 00:16:45.430
- Hmm.

192
00:16:48.901 --> 00:16:50.870
- Mutti is Otto's mother.

193
00:16:50.903 --> 00:16:54.539
He has two children, Gretchen
and John.


194
00:16:54.574 --> 00:16:58.476
Otto calls him Johan, but
everybody else calls him John.


195
00:16:58.510 --> 00:17:02.213
Otto is very traditional.

196
00:17:02.247 --> 00:17:03.181
- It's nice.

197
00:17:05.885 --> 00:17:07.753
Do they live nearby?

198
00:17:07.787 --> 00:17:09.722
- Yes, but we hardly see them.

199
00:17:09.755 --> 00:17:11.189
They have their own lives.

200
00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:20.231
Otto and I met online.

201
00:17:20.265 --> 00:17:22.133
We both lost our spouses.

202
00:17:22.167 --> 00:17:23.335
so there was nothing bad...

203
00:17:23.368 --> 00:17:25.638
It wasn't that kind of online.

204
00:17:25.671 --> 00:17:26.538
- Right

205
00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:34.145
I have to tell you something
Audrey.


206
00:17:36.214 --> 00:17:38.383
Otto doesn't know why you're
here.


207
00:17:38.416 --> 00:17:39.250
I'm sorry.

208
00:17:39.284 --> 00:17:40.318
I was gonna tell him but

209
00:17:41.621 --> 00:17:43.121
I didn't know how.

210
00:17:46.391 --> 00:17:48.326
- Hi, Audrey, this is Sunny.

211
00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:49.795
I'd love to meet you.

212
00:17:49.829 --> 00:17:51.463
And if things work out

213
00:17:51.496 --> 00:17:53.498
I would love for you to join our
family.


214
00:17:54.867 --> 00:17:56.836
I'm sorry Otto, I should have
told you.


215
00:17:58.971 --> 00:18:02.240
- So your parents are still
alive?


216
00:18:04.543 --> 00:18:06.478
What's wrong with them?

217
00:18:06.511 --> 00:18:09.481
Why do you need this strange
thing?


218
00:18:09.514 --> 00:18:11.483
- Is she here about the cable?

219
00:18:11.516 --> 00:18:13.786
- We don't have cable Mutti.

220
00:18:13.819 --> 00:18:15.520
Television is bad enough

221
00:18:15.554 --> 00:18:16.689
without the cable.

222
00:18:16.722 --> 00:18:17.923
You're missing nothing.

223
00:18:18.824 --> 00:18:19.692
- The internet?

224
00:18:19.725 --> 00:18:21.594
- Endless sickening pablum.

225
00:18:21.627 --> 00:18:23.228
- It could be a good source for
news.


226
00:18:23.261 --> 00:18:24.096
- What news?

227
00:18:24.130 --> 00:18:26.464
The world is still a stinking
mess.


228
00:18:26.498 --> 00:18:27.967
God is still dead.

229
00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.201
- Some sites can be educational.

230
00:18:31.871 --> 00:18:34.707
- I don't know if you guys
hadn't gone to the internet


231
00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:36.207
you wouldn't have met, right?

232
00:18:37.442 --> 00:18:38.276
- Hmm.

233
00:18:46.518 --> 00:18:47.753
- This is really delicious.

234
00:18:47.787 --> 00:18:48.754
Sunny, thank you.

235
00:18:56.929 --> 00:18:58.698
- Otto's an engineer.

236
00:18:58.731 --> 00:18:59.865
- Seriously?

237
00:18:59.899 --> 00:19:00.766
- Yah.

238
00:19:01.701 --> 00:19:03.535
- I am retired from NASA.

239
00:19:03.569 --> 00:19:05.370
- Oh, cool.

240
00:19:05.403 --> 00:19:07.338
What were you doing there?

241
00:19:07.372 --> 00:19:12.477
- Do you have a degree in
aeronautical engineering?


242
00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:13.411
- No.

243
00:19:13.445 --> 00:19:16.448
- So how would you
expect to understand it?


244
00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:19.985
- She's just trying to be polite
Otto.


245
00:19:33.331 --> 00:19:36.736
Otto and his son have a
difficult relationship.


246
00:19:37.703 --> 00:19:40.840
He does get along a little
better with his daughter though.


247
00:19:42.742 --> 00:19:45.845
- Johan lives his life as if
there are no other people.


248
00:19:46.612 --> 00:19:48.848
What kind of man calls at dinner
time.


249
00:19:50.448 --> 00:19:52.383
- How old are you?

250
00:19:52.417 --> 00:19:53.853
- Mutti die stille!

251
00:19:53.886 --> 00:19:55.955
Don't listen to her she's almost
blind.


252
00:19:55.988 --> 00:19:58.057
Also she's losing her mind.

253
00:19:58.090 --> 00:19:59.925
These symptoms are to be
expected


254
00:19:59.959 --> 00:20:03.562
as an individual nears death.

255
00:20:06.866 --> 00:20:08.601
- Tell Otto where you were
before.


256
00:20:11.604 --> 00:20:12.872
- I was working in Montana

257
00:20:12.905 --> 00:20:16.341
I was at this little
resort and I was a cook.


258
00:20:18.711 --> 00:20:20.579
- How long you were there?

259
00:20:20.613 --> 00:20:22.480
- Well, it was a seasonal job.

260
00:20:22.514 --> 00:20:24.884
So it's about three months.

261
00:20:26.518 --> 00:20:28.587
- How long have stayed in
Saugerties?


262
00:20:29.822 --> 00:20:33.424
- Pretty long like I
think it's a year now.


263
00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:36.896
- That's a long time?

264
00:20:36.929 --> 00:20:37.797
- For me it is.

265
00:20:38.864 --> 00:20:39.999
- What brought you here?

266
00:20:42.802 --> 00:20:44.069
- I was visiting a friend.

267
00:20:44.737 --> 00:20:46.538
- What happened to the friend?

268
00:20:49.708 --> 00:20:50.576
- I don't know.

269
00:20:54.379 --> 00:20:55.948
- Audrey was raised in
California.


270
00:20:57.683 --> 00:20:58.918
- The beaches.

271
00:20:58.951 --> 00:21:00.619
The warm sand.

272
00:21:02.121 --> 00:21:05.390
- We lived really kind
of far from the beach


273
00:21:05.423 --> 00:21:07.059
only went there a couple times.

274
00:21:11.864 --> 00:21:13.933
- How do you like it here
Audrey?


275
00:21:13.966 --> 00:21:15.366
- I like it.

276
00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:16.401
I like the river.

277
00:21:18.170 --> 00:21:19.638
- It's very deep.

278
00:21:19.672 --> 00:21:22.741
This is what enabled whaling
vessels


279
00:21:22.775 --> 00:21:24.777
to sail up from the ocean.

280
00:21:24.810 --> 00:21:25.644
- Whales?

281
00:21:25.678 --> 00:21:27.146
- Yah!

282
00:21:27.179 --> 00:21:31.717
In 1766, the British
parliament placed a duty


283
00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:34.385
on whale oil shipped to Britain.

284
00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:38.423
So a group of whalers in
Nantucket


285
00:21:38.456 --> 00:21:40.092
disassembled their houses

286
00:21:40.125 --> 00:21:41.727
and used them to make ships

287
00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:44.763
they then sailed them up the
Hudson River.


288
00:21:44.797 --> 00:21:47.398
Two miles from here they
disassembled their ships


289
00:21:47.432 --> 00:21:52.437
and reassembled their
houses to create a village.


290
00:21:52.638 --> 00:21:54.106
We now know as Hudson.

291
00:21:54.139 --> 00:21:56.909
- So they actually dragged
the whales up the river?


292
00:21:56.942 --> 00:21:57.610
- No.

293
00:21:57.643 --> 00:21:59.812
First they stripped the blubber.

294
00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:03.082
It's known as flensing.

295
00:22:03.115 --> 00:22:04.950
The remainder of the carcass was

296
00:22:06.785 --> 00:22:07.620
discarded

297
00:22:07.653 --> 00:22:08.921
in the open ocean.

298
00:22:14.159 --> 00:22:16.929
- Sunny I've finished eating.

299
00:22:16.962 --> 00:22:18.163
It is time to play.

300
00:22:20.733 --> 00:22:21.800
- What are we playing?

301
00:22:26.772 --> 00:22:29.540
Pretty sad looking tree
house you've got there.


302
00:22:29.575 --> 00:22:31.442
- It was there when we moved in.

303
00:22:35.214 --> 00:22:38.449
Sunny your hips are not aligned.

304
00:22:41.053 --> 00:22:42.888
- That's good now go the other
way.


305
00:22:44.957 --> 00:22:45.824
- Oh good shot.

306
00:22:49.028 --> 00:22:50.162
- Come on Mutti

307
00:22:52.064 --> 00:22:54.133
- You are sane approximately.

308
00:22:58.070 --> 00:22:59.504
- A sane as you are.

309
00:23:04.543 --> 00:23:05.978
- So

310
00:23:06.011 --> 00:23:07.646
we will call this an experiment.

311
00:23:12.117 --> 00:23:14.219
Sunny and I are taking Mutti to
Bavaria


312
00:23:14.253 --> 00:23:17.890
in the fall to see our old
farm before she expires.


313
00:23:18.891 --> 00:23:21.593
So we're gonna conduct
this experiment until then


314
00:23:21.627 --> 00:23:24.930
and at that time we
will assess the results.


315
00:23:25.965 --> 00:23:28.000
Perhaps it will continue.

316
00:23:28.033 --> 00:23:30.669
Perhaps it will be conclusive,
yah.


317
00:23:33.005 --> 00:23:34.173
- Sounds like a plan.

318
00:23:36.241 --> 00:23:39.078
- Of course the farm
is now a shopping mall.


319
00:23:39.778 --> 00:23:41.880
We'll take her to another place

320
00:23:41.914 --> 00:23:43.882
and tell her it's the actual
farm.


321
00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:49.788
- You don't think she's gonna
notice?


322
00:25:02.294 --> 00:25:03.996
- Today I'm gonna
walk you guys


323
00:25:04.029 --> 00:25:06.665
through doing acrylic on windows

324
00:25:06.698 --> 00:25:08.901
and that is kinda what's up
with this glow right back here


325
00:25:08.934 --> 00:25:10.069
this is actually blue

326
00:25:10.102 --> 00:25:11.036
and I'll show you guys pictures

327
00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:13.105
of the whole thing afterwards

328
00:25:13.138 --> 00:25:16.008
but just a couple tips
before we get started.


329
00:26:26.411 --> 00:26:27.279
- Hey.

330
00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:29.715
- Hey.

331
00:26:29.748 --> 00:26:31.183
- What's going on?

332
00:26:31.216 --> 00:26:34.386
- Oh just getting off work.

333
00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:43.829
- Is that biodegradable?

334
00:26:43.862 --> 00:26:44.830
- The paint?

335
00:26:46.131 --> 00:26:47.032
- Yeah.

336
00:26:47.065 --> 00:26:48.033
- Yeah, absolutely.

337
00:26:49.401 --> 00:26:51.470
- Don't let any get on the
tomatoes.


338
00:26:51.503 --> 00:26:52.337
- Got it.

339
00:26:53.839 --> 00:26:55.440
- You know it's the seventh,
right?


340
00:27:00.445 --> 00:27:01.446
- Yeah.

341
00:27:05.017 --> 00:27:05.884
I'm on it.

342
00:27:07.986 --> 00:27:10.088
At the tone, please record your
message.


343
00:27:10.122 --> 00:27:10.956
When you've finished recording

344
00:27:10.989 --> 00:27:13.292
you may hang up or press one for
more.


345
00:27:15.093 --> 00:27:17.262
- Hey guys, it's me Audrey.

346
00:27:17.296 --> 00:27:19.331
I was just calling to say hello

347
00:27:19.364 --> 00:27:20.432
and hope everything's going
well.


348
00:27:20.465 --> 00:27:21.466
And, um

349
00:27:22.367 --> 00:27:26.939
And dad I just wanted to
check in and see how you were.


350
00:27:26.972 --> 00:27:28.407
So

351
00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:29.908
yeah!

352
00:27:29.942 --> 00:27:32.778
Just give me a call whenever you
can.


353
00:27:32.811 --> 00:27:36.248
All right, things are
going really good here.


354
00:27:36.281 --> 00:27:37.115
So

355
00:27:40.018 --> 00:27:43.188
I'll talk to you soon. All
right, bye.

- I call this MIYM chicken.

364
00:28:31.036 --> 00:28:33.105
It means melt in your mouth.

365
00:28:33.138 --> 00:28:34.806
I hope you like it.

366
00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:35.540
- It looks great.

367
00:28:43.882 --> 00:28:44.850
- It's very moist.

368
00:28:52.024 --> 00:28:53.925
- What's the matter with her?

369
00:28:55.127 --> 00:28:56.028
- I'm fine

370
00:28:58.430 --> 00:28:59.398
I'm fine.

371
00:29:20.352 --> 00:29:22.487
- Otto would you go
see if she's all right.


372
00:29:23.355 --> 00:29:25.090
- A woman should go.

373
00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:44.309
- I think I have like a
stomach flu or something.


374
00:30:04.930 --> 00:30:06.998
- You don't have the flu.

375
00:30:14.973 --> 00:30:18.611
Children sometimes unburden
themselves to their parents.


376
00:30:19.511 --> 00:30:21.346
- Yeah, so I've heard.

377
00:30:27.285 --> 00:30:31.156
- Still I'm objectively
interested in your difficulties.


378
00:30:40.666 --> 00:30:43.935
- My dad ran over my pet
chicken when I was eight.


379
00:30:46.037 --> 00:30:47.038
It wasn't his fault.

380
00:30:47.072 --> 00:30:47.973
It just he

381
00:30:49.474 --> 00:30:50.643
was backing out of the garage

382
00:30:50.676 --> 00:30:52.077
and he just ran her over.

383
00:30:56.081 --> 00:30:59.084
- I've heard of this
happening to cats and dogs.


384
00:31:01.621 --> 00:31:03.589
- No somebody got me an
incubator


385
00:31:04.389 --> 00:31:09.261
and two fertilized eggs
and one just sat there.


386
00:31:09.294 --> 00:31:10.262
And the other one hatched.

387
00:31:10.295 --> 00:31:12.665
And I had her for like a year
and a half.


388
00:31:19.204 --> 00:31:21.674
- It was responsive to
affection.


389
00:31:37.022 --> 00:31:38.658
My own father was a professor.

390
00:31:40.392 --> 00:31:42.127
He knew nothing about farming,

391
00:31:42.829 --> 00:31:46.398
but in Germany after the
war, there was no food.


392
00:31:48.066 --> 00:31:49.334
He was forced to learn

393
00:31:51.102 --> 00:31:52.638
to raise sheep.

394
00:31:52.672 --> 00:31:53.538
We were told

395
00:31:54.406 --> 00:31:58.276
that we were not to
become fond of the lambs


396
00:31:58.310 --> 00:32:00.078
because they were to eat.

397
00:32:00.111 --> 00:32:00.979
So

398
00:32:03.081 --> 00:32:06.117
we will not serve chicken
while you are here.


399
00:32:10.556 --> 00:32:11.423
- Thank you.

400
00:32:22.334 --> 00:32:23.201
- Emotions.

401
00:32:31.109 --> 00:32:32.812
- You have grandkids right?

402
00:32:32.845 --> 00:32:36.081
- Two. They are seldom here.

403
00:32:36.849 --> 00:32:38.584
- They'd really like a tree
house.


404
00:32:40.853 --> 00:32:42.087
- Would they?

405
00:32:43.388 --> 00:32:45.090
- Yeah, they would.

406
00:32:49.327 --> 00:32:50.596
- Hey I'm Bobby I like to make
stuff.


407
00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:54.065
Today we're gonna start
building a tree house.


408
00:32:57.770 --> 00:32:59.070
This is gonna be a two part
video.


409
00:32:59.104 --> 00:32:59.939
And in the first part

410
00:32:59.972 --> 00:33:01.841
we're gonna build a big sturdy
platform


411
00:33:01.874 --> 00:33:04.342
and in the second part we'll
make it look really cool.


412
00:34:05.437 --> 00:34:06.806
- It's hard sometimes

413
00:34:06.839 --> 00:34:10.643
we must take care of our
parents.


414
00:34:11.844 --> 00:34:13.445
- I'll see you later Otto.

415
00:34:13.478 --> 00:34:14.346
- No.

416
00:34:16.281 --> 00:34:19.250
First we must unload the lumber.

417
00:34:42.742 --> 00:34:45.911
- You know I can stay with
her sometimes if you want.


418
00:34:51.449 --> 00:34:52.384
- You may have heard

419
00:34:52.417 --> 00:34:54.820
there's a smooth service
called the horizon,


420
00:34:54.854 --> 00:34:56.889
out of which nothing can escape.

421
00:34:56.922 --> 00:34:58.624
You may have also read
there's something called


422
00:34:58.658 --> 00:35:00.826
the singularity of the
center of a black hole


423
00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:03.461
where everything is crushed
into an infinitesimally.


424
00:35:03.495 --> 00:35:06.264
small infinitely dense point.

425
00:35:06.297 --> 00:35:08.868
Even these two simple
facts are likely wrong


426
00:35:08.901 --> 00:35:10.803
or at least more complicated.

427
00:35:10.836 --> 00:35:11.771
But nobody knows for sure.

428
00:35:11.804 --> 00:35:13.639
- If only we had the cable.

429
00:35:14.974 --> 00:35:18.376
- Inside there
to be a ball of string.


430
00:35:18.410 --> 00:35:21.647
There could be an incredibly
compact star.


431
00:35:23.015 --> 00:35:25.216
- You've done this before?

432
00:35:25.250 --> 00:35:25.918
- Shh.

433
00:35:52.878 --> 00:35:54.412
Hey

434
00:35:54.446 --> 00:35:55.881
- Hi.

435
00:35:55.915 --> 00:35:58.216
- Did you guys have a nice time?

436
00:35:59.985 --> 00:36:03.388
- Sunny give me two minutes to
prepare.


437
00:36:15.034 --> 00:36:18.369
- A hamburger you can
put it in the microwave.


438
00:36:18.403 --> 00:36:19.270
- Thanks.

439
00:36:20.706 --> 00:36:21.741
- Good night.

440
00:36:21.774 --> 00:36:22.842
- Good night.

441
00:36:47.566 --> 00:36:50.535
- Audrey its mom.

442
00:36:50.569 --> 00:36:52.370
You call us again and again

443
00:36:52.403 --> 00:36:55.574
and then when I call you
back you can't pick up?


444
00:36:55.608 --> 00:36:57.743
What the fuck is wrong with you.

445
00:36:57.777 --> 00:37:00.045
You gotta be available when we
reach out.


446
00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:35.708
- come in.

447
00:38:38.110 --> 00:38:39.144
Here are the tools.

448
00:38:39.178 --> 00:38:40.880
You know how to use them?

449
00:38:42.748 --> 00:38:45.150
- Yeah, I know how to use a lot
of things.


450
00:38:45.184 --> 00:38:45.985
- I see.

451
00:38:46.018 --> 00:38:48.153
You're trying to induce me to
say


452
00:38:48.187 --> 00:38:51.422
that a woman can't operate power
tools no?


453
00:38:51.456 --> 00:38:54.492
- No I just sort of expected
to be said that's all.


454
00:38:54.525 --> 00:38:58.429
- I imagine you do, for a
moment I considered that


455
00:38:59.265 --> 00:39:01.834
then I thought she's an honest
person.


456
00:39:01.867 --> 00:39:05.938
She wouldn't tell me she can
use them if she couldn't.


457
00:39:09.742 --> 00:39:13.545
My son one time expressed
interest in


458
00:39:14.947 --> 00:39:16.115
power tools.

459
00:39:16.148 --> 00:39:19.919
And then we went to a hardware
store bought all of this.


460
00:39:22.254 --> 00:39:24.189
- You know how to use them?

461
00:39:24.223 --> 00:39:25.090
- No.

462
00:39:27.893 --> 00:39:30.596
Sons want fathers to do these
things,


463
00:39:30.629 --> 00:39:31.496
don't they?

464
00:39:32.564 --> 00:39:35.634
- I think they just want
fathers to hang out with them.


465
00:39:35.668 --> 00:39:37.903
- I'm not a man who hangs out.

466
00:39:40.272 --> 00:39:43.242
Go on, open the next.

467
00:39:43.275 --> 00:39:44.143
- Okay.

468
00:39:50.082 --> 00:39:51.750
- Now I'm retired.

469
00:39:51.784 --> 00:39:53.218
Now I'm hanging out.

470
00:39:54.820 --> 00:39:56.221
And in this hanging out

471
00:39:56.255 --> 00:40:00.491
I discovered a curious
effect of deceleration.


472
00:40:00.525 --> 00:40:03.062
There are now gaps between my
activities.


473
00:40:03.829 --> 00:40:09.034
These gaps allow me to
experience regret.


474
00:40:09.467 --> 00:40:12.037
For example, activity

475
00:40:12.972 --> 00:40:14.840
I wasn't a father.

476
00:40:14.873 --> 00:40:16.541
Activity

477
00:40:16.575 --> 00:40:18.110
I was not a husband.

478
00:40:18.978 --> 00:40:22.548
Activity, I was a man who worked
too much.


479
00:40:22.581 --> 00:40:26.819
Activity, I was a man who grew
angry.


480
00:40:26.852 --> 00:40:28.120
It's nauseating.

481
00:40:31.657 --> 00:40:33.559
- All right, shall we get to
work?


482
00:40:35.594 --> 00:40:37.262
- You ever built a tree house
before?


483
00:40:38.263 --> 00:40:39.098
- Yeah.

484
00:41:14.833 --> 00:41:16.969
- So shall we say we will
complete it


485
00:41:17.002 --> 00:41:21.240
by the 4th of July so the
grandchildren can enjoy it.


486
00:41:21.273 --> 00:41:22.141
- We?

487
00:42:38.784 --> 00:42:41.053
- Hi Dad I'm just um

488
00:42:42.387 --> 00:42:45.224
I'm actually building
a tree house right now.


489
00:42:56.201 --> 00:42:59.705
- Because he only had two worms.

490
00:42:59.738 --> 00:43:00.405
- Hey Kenny.

491
00:43:12.017 --> 00:43:14.853
- Hey, Audrey, it's
Warren.


492
00:43:14.887 --> 00:43:16.989
Maybe you got my message that I
left.


493
00:43:18.023 --> 00:43:19.424
You have to pay the rent.

494
00:43:19.458 --> 00:43:20.459
It's time to do that now.

495
00:43:20.492 --> 00:43:22.928
And can you just pay it?

496
00:43:24.997 --> 00:43:27.933
I'll just knock again.

497
00:43:35.974 --> 00:43:39.077
I can lower the rent,
like a hundred dollars.


498
00:43:40.445 --> 00:43:41.747
I can ask my mom.

499
00:43:44.249 --> 00:43:45.984
- Thanks Warren it's okay.

500
00:43:46.018 --> 00:43:48.053
You know its time to go.

501
00:43:48.086 --> 00:43:48.987
I gotta go.

502
00:43:50.088 --> 00:43:51.723
For your mom?

503
00:43:51.757 --> 00:43:52.424
- Okay.

504
00:43:55.194 --> 00:43:57.229
- When am I gonna get the
deposit back?


505
00:43:58.363 --> 00:44:01.967
- Well we can see what's left
after I refinish the floors.


506
00:44:05.404 --> 00:44:06.772
I'm sure it'll be fine.

507
00:44:07.973 --> 00:44:08.840
- Cool.

508
00:47:26.572 --> 00:47:27.640
Sunny!

509
00:47:27.673 --> 00:47:30.208
Sunny the wind is predicted
to rise to twelve knots


510
00:47:30.242 --> 00:47:31.376
At three forty five.

511
00:47:31.410 --> 00:47:33.945
So, we have to finish the pie by
two.


512
00:47:33.979 --> 00:47:36.481
So, there is time to enjoy

513
00:47:36.515 --> 00:47:37.949
the Fat Daddy.

514
00:47:50.061 --> 00:47:52.097
- He's nervous. His kids are
coming.


515
00:47:58.604 --> 00:48:00.338
- How can I help?

516
00:48:00.372 --> 00:48:01.574
I can peel those if you want.

517
00:48:01.607 --> 00:48:03.141
- Why don't you go help Otto.

518
00:48:04.075 --> 00:48:04.943
- Of course.

519
00:48:09.014 --> 00:48:12.484
You need some help?

520
00:48:12.517 --> 00:48:16.087
- Some of these balls of
fire can be unpredictable.


521
00:48:19.057 --> 00:48:20.593
You have to be prepared.

522
00:48:26.164 --> 00:48:28.133
- Okay. Got it.

523
00:48:30.368 --> 00:48:33.673
- Sunny, she seems all right?

524
00:48:35.808 --> 00:48:37.375
- Yeah I think so.

525
00:48:39.579 --> 00:48:42.047
- Happy Fourth of July, Johan.

526
00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:42.748
- John.

527
00:48:47.519 --> 00:48:48.386
- He's my son.

528
00:48:56.629 --> 00:48:58.631
- The marinate is a little
sticky.


529
00:48:58.664 --> 00:49:00.766
So you might wanna grease the
grill.


530
00:49:10.242 --> 00:49:11.443
So is your sister coming?

531
00:49:12.444 --> 00:49:14.079
- Gretchen should be here soon.

532
00:49:14.914 --> 00:49:18.083
She has to celebrate with
her ex's family first.


533
00:49:19.384 --> 00:49:21.486
- Sounds complicated.

534
00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:23.321
- It's a much better situation
now.


535
00:49:27.593 --> 00:49:29.729
Otto loves his fireworks.

536
00:49:29.762 --> 00:49:32.698
- I know who calculates the
windage prior to ignition?


537
00:49:34.299 --> 00:49:35.233
- The windage?

538
00:49:35.267 --> 00:49:36.501
- That's the correct term.

539
00:49:39.404 --> 00:49:42.608
- Johan do not under cook the
steaks.


540
00:49:44.409 --> 00:49:47.212
- Ay you Kraut bastard.

541
00:49:50.716 --> 00:49:52.752
- How'd your parents die Audrey?

542
00:49:53.619 --> 00:49:54.854
- My parents aren't dead.

543
00:49:54.887 --> 00:49:56.856
- Then why are we adopting you?

544
00:49:56.889 --> 00:49:58.858
- Guys can we leave her alone?

545
00:49:58.891 --> 00:50:01.092
She has enough problems.

546
00:50:07.900 --> 00:50:11.369
So what's up with the tree
house?


547
00:50:12.805 --> 00:50:14.472
- Audrey's rebuilding it.

548
00:50:16.308 --> 00:50:19.311
- Oh is that something you know
how to do?


549
00:50:19.344 --> 00:50:20.178
- Yeah.

550
00:50:20.211 --> 00:50:21.112
- She's highly skilled.

551
00:50:22.548 --> 00:50:24.382
- Can I go up there?

552
00:50:24.416 --> 00:50:25.751
- It's too dangerous.

553
00:50:25.785 --> 00:50:28.554
- It'll be safe after
I finish it. I promise.


554
00:50:28.588 --> 00:50:29.855
- Well, better, late than never.

555
00:50:29.889 --> 00:50:32.357
We gave up trying to get Otto to
fix


556
00:50:32.390 --> 00:50:34.794
that tree house a long time ago.

557
00:50:35.861 --> 00:50:37.262
- There was never time.

558
00:50:46.204 --> 00:50:49.809
We're driving down to the
Cape in Florida Monday


559
00:50:51.309 --> 00:50:52.778
there will be a launch.

560
00:50:55.581 --> 00:50:57.282
- It's gonna be a long drive.

561
00:50:57.315 --> 00:50:58.584
- 16 hours.

562
00:50:58.618 --> 00:50:59.484
- Wow.

563
00:51:00.385 --> 00:51:02.253
Will you stay at a hotel?

564
00:51:02.287 --> 00:51:04.557
- No lift off is at dawn.

565
00:51:04.590 --> 00:51:07.225
We leave the morning
before, we watch the launch


566
00:51:07.258 --> 00:51:08.193
then we drive home.

567
00:51:08.226 --> 00:51:09.595
- Sunny enjoys

568
00:51:09.629 --> 00:51:12.865
the roar of the first stage
separation.


569
00:51:15.968 --> 00:51:16.836
- I really do.

570
00:51:21.807 --> 00:51:24.844
- There is blood in the steaks,
Johan.


571
00:51:24.877 --> 00:51:25.811
- John.

572
00:51:25.845 --> 00:51:28.446
- If there is blood.
There's still bacteria.


573
00:51:28.480 --> 00:51:30.716
- Do you know we're
nothing without bacteria.


574
00:51:30.750 --> 00:51:32.585
Otto it's all over our skin

575
00:51:33.518 --> 00:51:34.386
- Honey.

576
00:51:39.558 --> 00:51:41.727
- Everyone give the steaks to
me.


577
00:51:41.761 --> 00:51:42.728
- Honey, please.

578
00:51:42.762 --> 00:51:45.530
- I'm going to finish
cooking them correctly.


579
00:51:45.564 --> 00:51:46.699
Give it to me

580
00:51:48.601 --> 00:51:50.535
All of them, all of them.

581
00:51:50.569 --> 00:51:51.436
Give to me.

582
00:51:56.876 --> 00:51:57.843
- I'm leaving.

583
00:51:57.877 --> 00:52:00.746
- Go let him show you
how to make the meat.


584
00:52:00.780 --> 00:52:01.981
- Where's the thermometer?

585
00:52:02.014 --> 00:52:03.515
- It'll make him happy.

586
00:52:03.549 --> 00:52:04.449
- Doubtful.

587
00:52:04.482 --> 00:52:05.584
- I have the thermometer.

588
00:52:05.618 --> 00:52:08.554
- Okay. If you don't go,
we're all gonna be miserable.


589
00:52:08.587 --> 00:52:10.422
So take one for the team.

590
00:52:13.324 --> 00:52:16.662
- Johan you never put it near
the bone.


591
00:52:16.696 --> 00:52:19.230
Bone is much more conductive
than tissue.


592
00:52:19.264 --> 00:52:20.900
It gives a false reading.

593
00:52:20.933 --> 00:52:22.001
- There's no bone in these.

594
00:52:22.034 --> 00:52:23.435
- Someday there will be bone.

595
00:52:23.468 --> 00:52:25.336
You'll know what to do.

596
00:52:25.370 --> 00:52:28.908
- Audrey why don't you
go to the Cape with Otto


597
00:52:28.941 --> 00:52:30.442
the blast is incredible.

598
00:52:30.475 --> 00:52:31.276
- Yeah he can teach you all

599
00:52:31.309 --> 00:52:33.646
about aeronautics on the way
down.


600
00:52:33.679 --> 00:52:34.647
- You never know.

601
00:52:34.680 --> 00:52:36.247
You might find it interesting.

602
00:52:36.281 --> 00:52:38.283
- And if not you could pretend.

603
00:52:40.518 --> 00:52:41.620
- The steaks are ready?

604
00:52:41.654 --> 00:52:43.622
- I think they're done.

605
00:52:43.656 --> 00:52:44.790
- They are not.

606
00:52:44.824 --> 00:52:47.258
- They're fucking hockey pucks.

607
00:52:47.292 --> 00:52:50.796
- All right, I need to
check on the pudding.


608
00:52:50.830 --> 00:52:52.497
- Can I help you?

609
00:52:52.530 --> 00:52:54.299
- And watery diarrhea.

610
00:52:55.568 --> 00:52:56.936
Dump the scheisse.

611
00:53:03.308 --> 00:53:03.976
- Enjoy.

612
00:53:08.948 --> 00:53:11.016
- I want to go inside now.

613
00:53:29.735 --> 00:53:30.603
- Danke.

614
00:53:32.071 --> 00:53:32.938
Remote?

615
00:54:08.841 --> 00:54:10.109
- Want to get something to eat?

616
00:54:10.142 --> 00:54:12.077
Something with a lot of
bacteria.


617
00:54:14.814 --> 00:54:15.881
- You buying?

618
00:54:18.684 --> 00:54:19.552
Wow.

619
00:54:33.732 --> 00:54:35.466
- How do you like my father?

620
00:54:37.535 --> 00:54:38.671
- I think Otto's great.

621
00:54:42.708 --> 00:54:45.044
- Has he taken you fishing yet?

622
00:54:45.077 --> 00:54:47.378
- No. I didn't know he fished.

623
00:54:47.412 --> 00:54:49.882
- Well he doesn't, but
when he takes you fishing


624
00:54:49.915 --> 00:54:51.784
he'll set you up at the end of
the pier


625
00:54:51.817 --> 00:54:53.418
and then he'll sit down

626
00:54:53.451 --> 00:54:55.486
and count the number of casts
you make.


627
00:54:55.520 --> 00:54:58.624
And when you've hit 26,
it'll be time for you to go.


628
00:54:58.657 --> 00:55:00.826
Whether or not you caught a
fish.


629
00:55:00.860 --> 00:55:01.961
- Why 26?

630
00:55:01.994 --> 00:55:03.929
- He did a time and motion study

631
00:55:03.963 --> 00:55:05.931
and determined that if
you don't catch a fish


632
00:55:05.965 --> 00:55:08.033
after 26 casts that you never
will.


633
00:55:09.434 --> 00:55:10.501
Once I figured out the system

634
00:55:10.535 --> 00:55:13.639
then I'd wait longer and
longer in between each cast


635
00:55:13.672 --> 00:55:15.007
because I wanted it to

636
00:55:17.542 --> 00:55:18.409
last.

637
00:55:24.783 --> 00:55:27.485
- At least he you took you
fishing.


638
00:55:27.518 --> 00:55:28.386
It's nice.

639
00:55:37.162 --> 00:55:38.529
- During the summer
months


640
00:55:38.564 --> 00:55:39.798
when ticks are most active.

641
00:55:39.832 --> 00:55:42.500
But first thing you can do is
wear light colored clothes.


642
00:55:42.533 --> 00:55:44.169
If you're gonna come across a
tick


643
00:55:44.203 --> 00:55:45.604
you're gonna wind up being able
to see


644
00:55:45.638 --> 00:55:47.172
that tick crawling on your pants

645
00:55:47.206 --> 00:55:48.774
or crawling on your shirt.

646
00:55:48.807 --> 00:55:49.975
Even better than that would be

647
00:55:50.009 --> 00:55:50.943
if you're wearing socks

648
00:55:50.976 --> 00:55:53.411
you can tuck those pants into
your socks.


649
00:56:06.091 --> 00:56:06.959
Ooh.

650
00:56:11.196 --> 00:56:12.530
No, you're right.

651
00:56:15.734 --> 00:56:17.002
- Cause it'd be like incest.

652
00:56:17.036 --> 00:56:17.937
- Stop talking.

653
00:56:19.672 --> 00:56:22.775
- We could go to one of
those states where it's legal


654
00:56:22.808 --> 00:56:23.676
or at least they look the other
way.


655
00:56:23.709 --> 00:56:25.144
- Just stop saying words.

656
00:56:26.745 --> 00:56:28.147
You're not gonna drive, right?

657
00:56:28.180 --> 00:56:29.014
- No.

658
00:56:29.048 --> 00:56:30.215
- Good.

659
00:56:35.988 --> 00:56:37.189
- Good times.

660
00:56:37.222 --> 00:56:38.257
- Yeah.

661
00:56:38.290 --> 00:56:39.825
- Johan.

662
00:56:39.858 --> 00:56:40.926
- Oh shit.

663
00:56:42.094 --> 00:56:43.896
- Johan where did you take her?

664
00:56:43.929 --> 00:56:45.764
- He just took me to get some
food.


665
00:56:45.798 --> 00:56:47.967
- You have been
drinking.


666
00:56:58.644 --> 00:57:02.247
Why is it that immigrants
have more respect


667
00:57:02.281 --> 00:57:04.049
for the national holiday?

668
00:57:04.083 --> 00:57:05.851
- What are you talking about
Otto?


669
00:57:05.884 --> 00:57:08.153
- You are having a
celebration and you left.


670
00:57:08.988 --> 00:57:11.890
- I actually really like the 4th
of July.


671
00:57:11.924 --> 00:57:16.128
I just thought you and
Sunny needed a little space.


672
00:57:31.877 --> 00:57:33.712
We are not going to the Cape.

673
00:57:38.217 --> 00:57:39.084
- Otto

674
00:57:41.253 --> 00:57:42.955
his name is John.

675
00:57:42.988 --> 00:57:46.091
He prefers John. He's a nice
guy.


676
00:57:46.125 --> 00:57:47.659
- What's that mean?

677
00:57:47.693 --> 00:57:51.096
Is that what a man wants
on his grave marker


678
00:57:51.130 --> 00:57:52.564
he was a nice guy?

679
00:57:53.265 --> 00:57:56.235
Better to say he was adequate.

680
00:58:01.373 --> 00:58:04.777
It's not safe to drive with him.

681
00:58:04.810 --> 00:58:05.677
- John?

682
00:58:05.711 --> 00:58:09.615
- No in general. You must be
vigilant.


683
00:58:11.083 --> 00:58:13.252
Also it's a holiday.

684
00:58:13.285 --> 00:58:14.620
People drink.

685
00:58:16.855 --> 00:58:18.957
They fire guns in the sky.

686
00:58:18.991 --> 00:58:22.694
- Otto I've been taking care
of myself for pretty long now.


687
00:58:22.728 --> 00:58:25.798
- Listen to me, the world is
dangerous.


688
00:58:32.271 --> 00:58:34.807
I'm talking to you as if you are
my child.


689
00:58:39.144 --> 00:58:41.146
I've forgotten.

690
00:58:41.180 --> 00:58:43.248
How disagreeable that is.

691
00:59:35.467 --> 00:59:37.202
- Hi it's Warren's
phone.


692
00:59:37.236 --> 00:59:38.437
Please call me back.

693
00:59:38.470 --> 00:59:43.675
I mean, I will call you back
when you leave a message here.


694
00:59:43.942 --> 00:59:45.377
Thank you. Okay, bye.

695
00:59:48.413 --> 00:59:50.149
- Hey Warren, it's Audrey.

696
00:59:51.850 --> 00:59:54.353
I really need my security
deposit back.


697
00:59:56.855 --> 01:00:00.359
And if I could get it in cash,
that would be preferable.


698
01:00:02.928 --> 01:00:04.696
Just call me when you can

699
01:00:04.730 --> 01:00:07.866
or you can text me and we can
meet up.


700
01:00:09.001 --> 01:00:09.968
I hope you're well.

701
01:00:19.077 --> 01:00:20.879
- If you have ever
thought


702
01:00:20.913 --> 01:00:23.982
about moving to Vermont
Governor Phil Scott


703
01:00:24.016 --> 01:00:25.417
just signed a law that may make
it


704
01:00:25.450 --> 01:00:26.919
a little more enticing

705
01:00:26.952 --> 01:00:28.353
workers who move to Vermont

706
01:00:28.387 --> 01:00:30.389
and make it their home will be
eligible


707
01:00:30.422 --> 01:00:34.092
for up to $10,000 in moving
expenses and other costs.


708
01:00:34.126 --> 01:00:35.894
State officials hope that the
money


709
01:00:35.928 --> 01:00:38.130
and Vermont's high
quality of life will lure


710
01:00:38.163 --> 01:00:41.300
out of state workers to
trade their office work.


711
01:00:56.048 --> 01:00:57.416
- You coming up?

712
01:00:57.449 --> 01:00:58.317
- Yeah.

713
01:01:02.955 --> 01:01:05.924
Looks like there's much more
work to do.


714
01:01:05.958 --> 01:01:08.327
- No, I'm actually almost
finished.


715
01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:13.465
- No this section, for example
requires more support here.


716
01:01:13.498 --> 01:01:15.400
It will stabilize it.

717
01:01:15.434 --> 01:01:17.236
- Otto I don't have any more
lumber.


718
01:01:17.269 --> 01:01:18.070
- You can get more.

719
01:01:18.103 --> 01:01:20.105
- If I did that all the way
around.


720
01:01:20.138 --> 01:01:22.441
That's another like day, two
days of work.


721
01:01:22.474 --> 01:01:24.042
- Oh three, I think.

722
01:01:24.711 --> 01:01:27.112
And you have pride in your
labor.


723
01:01:30.882 --> 01:01:31.883
- All right.

724
01:01:50.570 --> 01:01:55.307
- Lithium is present only under
the salt plains of Bolivia


725
01:01:57.242 --> 01:01:59.344
some day it will run out.

726
01:01:59.378 --> 01:02:02.247
Which is why another
battery material is needed.


727
01:02:02.281 --> 01:02:06.285
Manufacturers are not
willing to knowledge this.


728
01:02:33.378 --> 01:02:34.846
- What the fuck?

729
01:03:44.182 --> 01:03:45.618
- Hey Audrey.

730
01:03:45.651 --> 01:03:46.518
Hi

731
01:03:49.087 --> 01:03:52.124
So I brought the money.

732
01:03:52.157 --> 01:03:52.991
- My deposit, thank you.

733
01:03:53.024 --> 01:03:54.960
- Yeah, it's in cash like you
asked.


734
01:03:54.993 --> 01:03:55.661
- I needed this.

735
01:03:59.398 --> 01:04:00.633
- Where do you live now?

736
01:04:02.702 --> 01:04:03.569
- Just

737
01:04:05.103 --> 01:04:06.505
you know, around.

738
01:04:12.177 --> 01:04:13.478
I'm fine.

739
01:04:13.512 --> 01:04:16.314
I'm on my way out of town
actually going to be leaving
soon.


740
01:04:21.319 --> 01:04:22.487
I'm just ready.

741
01:04:25.023 --> 01:04:25.991
You ever feel like that?

742
01:04:26.024 --> 01:04:29.227
Where you're just ready
to see something else.


743
01:04:32.632 --> 01:04:33.498
- I mean

744
01:04:36.034 --> 01:04:36.702
volcanoes

745
01:04:43.074 --> 01:04:45.076
But I live here.

746
01:04:45.110 --> 01:04:46.011
It's my home.

747
01:04:47.112 --> 01:04:49.047
- But you could live anywhere.

748
01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:50.382
Your home could be anywhere.

749
01:04:52.718 --> 01:04:54.252
- Not really.

750
01:04:54.286 --> 01:04:58.089
It's where you live,
where your family lives.


751
01:04:58.123 --> 01:04:59.124
Me and my mom live here.

752
01:04:59.157 --> 01:05:00.058
- Yeah I get it.

753
01:05:08.801 --> 01:05:10.736
- I would rather that you didn't
leave.


754
01:05:17.409 --> 01:05:18.410
- Thank you, Warren.

755
01:05:19.645 --> 01:05:22.047
What do you have there?

756
01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:24.182
- I brought you some tomatoes,

757
01:05:24.216 --> 01:05:25.417
from my tomato garden.

758
01:05:25.450 --> 01:05:26.451
- Thanks.

759
01:05:26.485 --> 01:05:27.620
- Here you go.

760
01:05:57.583 --> 01:05:59.317
- I did this whole thing for
Otto.


761
01:06:00.553 --> 01:06:01.486
- I figured that.

762
01:06:02.722 --> 01:06:04.089
- I'm sorry I misled you.

763
01:06:05.290 --> 01:06:06.157
- Okay.

764
01:06:10.730 --> 01:06:12.097
- You'll be leaving soon?

765
01:06:28.246 --> 01:06:30.215
I hate rockets.

766
01:06:30.248 --> 01:06:31.483
- Really?

767
01:06:31.516 --> 01:06:32.685
- You can tell.

768
01:06:32.718 --> 01:06:33.586
- Oh yeah.

769
01:07:17.597 --> 01:07:18.463
- Audrey.

770
01:07:31.744 --> 01:07:33.244
- You found me.

771
01:07:33.278 --> 01:07:34.714
- Yeah.

772
01:07:34.747 --> 01:07:36.749
- Sunny, she told me you are
leaving.


773
01:07:41.453 --> 01:07:42.555
Do I smell cumin?

774
01:07:48.526 --> 01:07:49.629
- You want some?

775
01:07:50.563 --> 01:07:51.429
- Yeah.

776
01:07:52.430 --> 01:07:53.298
- Good

777
01:07:56.936 --> 01:07:57.837
Sit down.

778
01:08:38.543 --> 01:08:41.479
- I see that you have prior
experiences.


779
01:08:44.817 --> 01:08:46.786
- The wheels come off every now
and again.


780
01:08:46.819 --> 01:08:48.353
And I do this for a bit

781
01:08:48.386 --> 01:08:50.790
and then I get things back on
track.


782
01:09:04.402 --> 01:09:07.707
- So you will finish the
tree house before you go?


783
01:09:37.670 --> 01:09:38.536
This is for you.

784
01:09:39.839 --> 01:09:42.775
Mutti give it to me. It
was to help me sleep.


785
01:09:43.441 --> 01:09:46.912
- Shouldn't you give that
to like Gretchen or John?


786
01:09:46.946 --> 01:09:50.549
- They say this is music for
Nazis.


787
01:09:52.517 --> 01:09:54.687
My parents were not Nazis.

788
01:10:15.473 --> 01:10:16.642
- This helped you sleep?

789
01:10:17.676 --> 01:10:18.778
- Of course not.

790
01:10:20.980 --> 01:10:22.313
Listen to it.

791
01:10:36.394 --> 01:10:37.462
- One of the awesome
things


792
01:10:37.495 --> 01:10:39.698
about living here in Vermont
has been just the number


793
01:10:39.732 --> 01:10:41.634
of friendships I've
been able to establish.


794
01:10:41.667 --> 01:10:43.569
So today's gonna be a big day

795
01:10:43.602 --> 01:10:45.704
for doing some work on the barn.

796
01:10:52.945 --> 01:10:57.016
- The term meteor in fact
refers to the streak of light


797
01:10:58.684 --> 01:11:02.955
caused by a meteoroid as it
collides


798
01:11:02.988 --> 01:11:06.692
with the upper regions
of the earth atmosphere.


799
01:11:08.694 --> 01:11:11.630
Most of meteoroids are only the
size


800
01:11:12.530 --> 01:11:14.834
of a grain of sand.

801
01:11:14.867 --> 01:11:15.868
- Is that right?

802
01:11:17.136 --> 01:11:18.536
- Space dust.

803
01:11:23.408 --> 01:11:25.778
Measure twice cut once.

804
01:11:38.023 --> 01:11:39.091
- We're here.

805
01:11:40.893 --> 01:11:42.094
- Hey.

806
01:11:42.127 --> 01:11:44.930
- We're finishing up the tree
house for my grandchildren.


807
01:11:44.964 --> 01:11:47.099
- I told you they can't go up
there.


808
01:11:47.132 --> 01:11:49.001
- Audrey is making it safe.

809
01:11:49.034 --> 01:11:51.604
It's more than sufficient
to meet the demands


810
01:11:51.637 --> 01:11:52.705
of the County Building Code.

811
01:11:52.738 --> 01:11:54.607
- Tree houses don't have
building codes.


812
01:11:54.640 --> 01:11:57.375
- If there was, it would
pass there's no doubt.


813
01:12:00.946 --> 01:12:03.015
- Sorry can you stop that.

814
01:12:11.557 --> 01:12:16.028
- When you were a child, you
often asked me to fix it.


815
01:12:16.061 --> 01:12:17.630
- Yes, I did.

816
01:12:19.965 --> 01:12:23.035
- Look at it
now you can use it.

817
01:12:23.068 --> 01:12:24.036
- Fuck.

818
01:12:24.069 --> 01:12:26.471
- I cannot understand
when she was a child.


819
01:12:26.504 --> 01:12:28.941
She was the stable one, a fixed
particle.


820
01:12:28.974 --> 01:12:30.541
- Maybe you should go talk to
her.


821
01:12:30.576 --> 01:12:31.610
- Is that appropriate.

822
01:12:31.644 --> 01:12:32.978
- Yeah, it's appropriate.

823
01:12:33.012 --> 01:12:34.512
- What do I say?

824
01:12:44.556 --> 01:12:46.592
- Just go in there and listen to
her


825
01:12:46.625 --> 01:12:48.160
and try not to teach her
anything.


826
01:13:19.124 --> 01:13:20.259
- Hey Audrey?

827
01:13:20.292 --> 01:13:22.795
- Fuuuuck! Fuck! Fuck!

828
01:13:22.828 --> 01:13:23.829
- Are you okay?

829
01:13:23.862 --> 01:13:25.698
- Goddammit you little fucker.

830
01:13:25.731 --> 01:13:27.032
- Hey what did you just call
him?


831
01:13:27.066 --> 01:13:28.067
- What the fuck?

832
01:13:28.100 --> 01:13:30.235
- What is the matter with you?

833
01:13:30.269 --> 01:13:31.502
Oh my God.

834
01:13:31.536 --> 01:13:32.805
- Oh shit.

835
01:13:32.838 --> 01:13:35.074
My finger I don't know where it
is.


836
01:13:35.107 --> 01:13:38.911
- Right there get in
the house in the house?


837
01:13:38.944 --> 01:13:40.012
- Oh God.

838
01:13:43.048 --> 01:13:44.216
- I'll get the first aid kit.

839
01:13:44.249 --> 01:13:45.884
- We need the big one.

840
01:13:57.296 --> 01:13:59.164
- I think it's time for me to
go.


841
01:14:00.232 --> 01:14:01.700
- Yeah

842
01:14:01.734 --> 01:14:02.601
- Yeah

843
01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:08.707
- Scheisse

844
01:14:13.779 --> 01:14:15.914
Where are you going now?

845
01:14:17.983 --> 01:14:19.752
- I have some friends in Vermont

846
01:14:19.785 --> 01:14:20.652
who are

847
01:14:22.054 --> 01:14:24.990
her barn is needing some repair.

848
01:14:25.024 --> 01:14:26.925
- How will you do that?

849
01:14:26.959 --> 01:14:28.594
You're missing a finger.

850
01:14:33.966 --> 01:14:35.834
Do you have insurance?

851
01:14:42.875 --> 01:14:43.976
I will pay.

852
01:14:44.009 --> 01:14:45.744
- This is an emergency room
Otto.


853
01:14:45.778 --> 01:14:47.279
They fix you whether you can pay
or not.


854
01:14:47.312 --> 01:14:48.647
That's how it works.

855
01:14:49.982 --> 01:14:51.283
- What do we got here?

856
01:14:51.316 --> 01:14:52.551
- We got a finger.

857
01:14:56.255 --> 01:14:57.790
- You sure do.

858
01:14:57.823 --> 01:14:59.091
Let's see what we can do with
it.


859
01:14:59.124 --> 01:14:59.992
- Good.

860
01:15:02.261 --> 01:15:04.596
- It's gonna be a really long
time Otto.


861
01:15:04.630 --> 01:15:06.265
I think you should probably go
home.


862
01:15:07.399 --> 01:15:08.300
- I will wait.

863
01:15:15.741 --> 01:15:17.076
- It's okay if you come in.

864
01:15:17.109 --> 01:15:18.177
You're her dad, right?

865
01:15:27.252 --> 01:15:28.620
- Just go home.

866
01:19:20.285 --> 01:19:21.086
- Hey mom.

867
01:19:21.119 --> 01:19:22.020
- Hi Audrey.

868
01:19:26.024 --> 01:19:26.892
Come in.

869
01:19:37.536 --> 01:19:38.970
- Who has a shot at a
million


870
01:19:39.004 --> 01:19:40.372
the rest can still win the
overall


871
01:19:40.405 --> 01:19:42.240
but they would get on the grid,

872
01:19:42.274 --> 01:19:44.543
the riders in the game, 22

873
01:19:44.577 --> 01:19:48.548
but there's only one with a
shot at a million dollars.


874
01:19:48.581 --> 01:19:53.185
And that's Eli Tommack
he has to win this race


875
01:19:53.218 --> 01:19:57.089
right here to continue
that quest to a million.


876
01:19:57.122 --> 01:19:59.625
Can he do it again he did it
last year.


877
01:20:03.228 --> 01:20:05.598
How about the Toyota
Wholeshot it's the rider


878
01:20:05.631 --> 01:20:08.166
whose been out for 16 months.

879
01:20:08.967 --> 01:20:14.139
and then just
like the 64.


880
01:20:26.552 --> 01:20:28.220
- How are the kids?

881
01:20:31.657 --> 01:20:33.392
- I don't have kids.

882
01:20:45.070 --> 01:20:45.937
Hey Dad

883
01:20:49.642 --> 01:20:52.077
Why did you and mom get married?

884
01:20:55.648 --> 01:20:58.116
- She had air conditioning.

885
01:21:01.153 --> 01:21:02.287
- Makes sense.

886
01:21:29.414 --> 01:21:31.183
Can I tell you something

887
01:21:33.753 --> 01:21:36.421
about me dad?

888
01:21:42.427 --> 01:21:43.428
I move around a lot.

889
01:21:44.564 --> 01:21:48.099
In the past two years, I've
lived in four different places.


890
01:21:48.133 --> 01:21:51.671
I've had like six, seven
different jobs.


891
01:21:53.673 --> 01:21:56.541
I get someplace and it's great.

892
01:21:56.576 --> 01:22:00.646
Things are working out and then
they just


893
01:22:00.680 --> 01:22:02.615
stop working out.

894
01:22:05.116 --> 01:22:10.121
I think once people get to
know everything about me


895
01:22:13.058 --> 01:22:14.459
I just got to keep moving.

896
01:22:26.538 --> 01:22:28.073
Why do I do that?

897
01:22:38.517 --> 01:22:39.752
- I don't know.

898
01:25:30.522 --> 01:25:32.424
- I was driving to the library

899
01:25:32.457 --> 01:25:35.861
to return "A Theories on Dark
Matter."


900
01:25:37.495 --> 01:25:38.631
And I saw your minivan.

901
01:25:40.465 --> 01:25:41.767
It's a distinctive car.

902
01:25:43.401 --> 01:25:44.402
- Yes it is.

903
01:25:45.971 --> 01:25:46.872
- May I see it.

904
01:25:49.875 --> 01:25:50.743
- Yeah.

905
01:25:51.944 --> 01:25:53.546
- Is there nerve damage?

906
01:25:53.579 --> 01:25:55.881
- I mean I can't feel a thing.

907
01:25:55.915 --> 01:25:57.917
- Careful around hot objects.

908
01:25:58.751 --> 01:26:00.553
It will burn before you're aware
of it.


909
01:26:00.586 --> 01:26:01.453
- I know Otto.

910
01:26:04.890 --> 01:26:07.258
- You didn't go to Vermont.

911
01:26:07.292 --> 01:26:07.960
- No.

912
01:26:10.462 --> 01:26:12.363
No, I was already to go and
packed up.


913
01:26:12.397 --> 01:26:15.768
I came in here to get some
propane and I saw they're
hiring.


914
01:26:15.801 --> 01:26:19.437
So I thought I'd give the old

915
01:26:19.471 --> 01:26:22.908
staying put, a try.

916
01:26:22.942 --> 01:26:24.275
See what that was like.

917
01:26:25.510 --> 01:26:27.713
- And what is it like?

918
01:26:28.814 --> 01:26:29.815
- So far so good.

919
01:26:31.650 --> 01:26:32.718
I like it here.

920
01:26:39.859 --> 01:26:41.026
- Do you have friends?

921
01:26:42.795 --> 01:26:44.362
- I'm working on it

922
01:26:45.030 --> 01:26:47.566
- To have friends is crucial

923
01:26:47.600 --> 01:26:49.702
to regulating blood pressure.

924
01:26:56.474 --> 01:26:57.777
So?

925
01:26:57.810 --> 01:26:58.677
- Yeah.
