1
00:02:14.171 --> 00:02:17.298
That's my other line.
I'll call you back later.


2
00:02:17.381 --> 00:02:19.550
- All right.
- Jerry, can you see my hair?


3
00:02:19.591 --> 00:02:21.759
Hey, can you pick me up later?
I need to go to the mall.


4
00:02:21.842 --> 00:02:23.844
I need those shoes
we saw yesterday.


5
00:02:23.927 --> 00:02:25.636
I can't. I'm picking up
Yanin from ballet.


6
00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:27.512
Yamil, why can't
Yustin pick her up?


7
00:02:27.596 --> 00:02:29.433
He has baseball practice.
Why don't you go yourself?


8
00:02:29.516 --> 00:02:31.141
Because I'm still not
allowed near the car.


9
00:02:31.225 --> 00:02:32.435
Oh, yeah, that's right.

10
00:02:32.518 --> 00:02:34.061
That stop sign
was in the wrong place.


11
00:02:36.145 --> 00:02:38.062
What is he wearing?

12
00:02:38.104 --> 00:02:40.606
- Who?
- The weirdo on 25.


13
00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.606
Professor Dayton?
My dad says he's a genius.


14
00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.108
He gives me the creeps.

15
00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.111
I'm walking away.

16
00:02:47.153 --> 00:02:50.320
Excuse me,
Mr. Mailman?


17
00:02:50.404 --> 00:02:52.530
I can not wait to move out
of this neighborhood.


18
00:02:52.612 --> 00:02:55.114
- I know, right?
- Hi, sir. How are you today?


19
00:02:55.198 --> 00:02:56.825
How am I?

20
00:02:56.908 --> 00:02:59.286
Hang on, cute guy alert.

21
00:02:59.328 --> 00:03:00.995
What? Who? Where?

22
00:03:01.078 --> 00:03:03.455
Give me all the details.
Where's he at?


23
00:03:03.537 --> 00:03:06.207
Fat Joe's.
Must be a cousin.


24
00:03:07.874 --> 00:03:11.085
It's a package.
I've been waiting for weeks


25
00:03:11.127 --> 00:03:13.085
for a package.
It's about this big.


26
00:03:13.127 --> 00:03:16.253
Why don't you go back
to your computer, you geek?


27
00:03:18.756 --> 00:03:22.091
Oh. I cannot wait to move out
of this neighborhood.


28
00:03:22.133 --> 00:03:24.136
You already said that.

29
00:03:24.178 --> 00:03:26.761
Oh, that's my mom calling.
I gotta go.


30
00:03:26.845 --> 00:03:28.095
Come rescue me, please?

31
00:03:28.179 --> 00:03:30.515
Okay, I'll call you at home.
Okay? Bye.


32
00:03:34.184 --> 00:03:36.311
What matters is
I've been waiting weeks


33
00:03:36.394 --> 00:03:39.354
for a package
that looks just like that!


34
00:03:39.437 --> 00:03:42.147
I really hate
this neighborhood.


35
00:03:49.985 --> 00:03:51.862
Ugh.

36
00:03:53.279 --> 00:03:55.490
Aren't you going
to say hello, Alice?


37
00:03:55.573 --> 00:03:56.657
What's that, Dad?

38
00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:00.034
Oh, it's
a universal remote.


39
00:04:00.119 --> 00:04:01.953
It's supposed to
control everything.


40
00:04:01.995 --> 00:04:04.038
I picked it up
from a street vendor.


41
00:04:04.122 --> 00:04:06.123
Looks like one of
the professor's gadgets.


42
00:04:06.205 --> 00:04:07.581
Maybe I should
show it to him.


43
00:04:07.664 --> 00:04:09.624
- That creep across the street?
- Alice.


44
00:04:09.666 --> 00:04:12.168
Don't talk about him
like that, Alice.


45
00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:13.961
He's a very
intelligent man.


46
00:04:14.002 --> 00:04:15.878
- Whatever.
- Young lady,


47
00:04:15.962 --> 00:04:18.129
you're gonna wash your
hands and come back down.


48
00:04:18.213 --> 00:04:20.215
Dinner is almost ready.

49
00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:22.342
She can't eat,
she's on a diet.


50
00:04:22.425 --> 00:04:25.551
He's eavesdropping on me.
Mom, tell him to stop.


51
00:04:25.635 --> 00:04:26.969
Because she's fat.

52
00:04:27.011 --> 00:04:29.222
Lewis, say something.

53
00:04:29.305 --> 00:04:31.347
What diet?
What fat?


54
00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.516
Hey, didn't we have a talk
about listening in


55
00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.351
on other people's
conversations?


56
00:04:35.433 --> 00:04:38.144
I wasn't.
Mom!


57
00:04:38.227 --> 00:04:40.228
Honey...

58
00:04:40.312 --> 00:04:43.354
We'll talk after dinner.
Now do as I say.


59
00:04:43.438 --> 00:04:46.151
She's too skinny.
She'll never find a husband.


60
00:04:46.193 --> 00:04:48.234
She has no ass.

61
00:04:50.027 --> 00:04:51.112
Grandma!

62
00:04:51.195 --> 00:04:53.821
- Is that how a dean talks?
- I'm off-duty.


63
00:04:53.905 --> 00:04:56.989
What's so funny about
not having an ass?


64
00:04:57.032 --> 00:04:59.867
An ass is more
important than tits.


65
00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:02.161
Tits are for amateurs.

66
00:05:02.244 --> 00:05:03.912
Please tell me I'm adopted.

67
00:05:03.996 --> 00:05:05.580
If I understand this setting,

68
00:05:05.663 --> 00:05:07.831
this button controls
the color and hue settings.


69
00:05:10.542 --> 00:05:12.333
- Hello.
- Hey, girl, it's me.


70
00:05:12.375 --> 00:05:14.209
I'm an amateur.

71
00:05:14.293 --> 00:05:16.212
Tell me you dumped
the little brat


72
00:05:16.254 --> 00:05:18.380
and we're going
to the mall.


73
00:05:22.258 --> 00:05:24.592
Hello...

74
00:05:24.675 --> 00:05:28.553
Dad, there's something
wrong with the phone.


75
00:05:28.595 --> 00:05:31.806
Da...
Dad?


76
00:05:33.933 --> 00:05:35.516
Mom?

77
00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.142
Grams?
Jesse?


78
00:05:39.311 --> 00:05:42.229
Come out now.
You're not funny.


79
00:06:37.934 --> 00:06:40.936
Are you still
with us, Alice?


80
00:06:47.565 --> 00:06:50.484
Young lady, you're going to wash
your hands and come back down.


81
00:06:50.567 --> 00:06:52.484
Dinner's almost ready.

82
00:06:52.568 --> 00:06:55.112
- What's going on?
- She can't eat. She's on a diet.


83
00:06:55.195 --> 00:06:57.239
Because she's fat.

84
00:06:57.322 --> 00:06:58.781
Lewis, say something.

85
00:06:58.865 --> 00:07:01.282
Fat?
What? Who's fat?


86
00:07:01.324 --> 00:07:04.161
Didn't we have a talk about listening
to other people's conversations?


87
00:07:04.244 --> 00:07:06.078
I wasn't.
Mom!


88
00:07:06.162 --> 00:07:08.497
Honey... you be quiet.

89
00:07:08.581 --> 00:07:10.081
We'll talk after dinner.

90
00:07:10.165 --> 00:07:11.915
Now do as I say.

91
00:07:11.957 --> 00:07:15.250
She's too skinny.
She'll never find a husband.


92
00:07:15.335 --> 00:07:17.918
She has no ass.

93
00:07:20.463 --> 00:07:22.589
Mom, shame on you.

94
00:07:22.631 --> 00:07:24.923
I think this one's
for the subtitles.


95
00:07:56.487 --> 00:07:58.697
Please.

96
00:08:10.914 --> 00:08:12.331
The remote.

97
00:08:12.373 --> 00:08:13.957
The remote.

98
00:08:14.042 --> 00:08:17.500
Sir? Dad? Señor?

99
00:08:17.541 --> 00:08:20.836
Please don't
touch that thing.


100
00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:22.712
Don't touch.

101
00:08:58.405 --> 00:09:01.240
Alice.
Alice.


102
00:09:01.323 --> 00:09:04.325
Hey!

103
00:09:04.407 --> 00:09:06.871
Hey, Professor Dayton!

104
00:09:10.413 --> 00:09:12.998
Professor Dayton!
Professor!


105
00:09:13.081 --> 00:09:15.250
Alice.

106
00:09:15.332 --> 00:09:16.999
Hey!

107
00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:20.418
Wait! No!
Professor Dayton!


108
00:09:22.086 --> 00:09:24.172
Professor Dayton, wait!

109
00:09:31.095 --> 00:09:33.261
Okay.

110
00:09:33.345 --> 00:09:36.889
I get it about the ball!
I won't throw it again.


111
00:09:36.972 --> 00:09:38.807
You can stop now.

112
00:09:38.891 --> 00:09:41.933
I really hate
this neighborhood.


113
00:09:47.979 --> 00:09:51.023
Professor Dayton!

114
00:10:02.572 --> 00:10:05.365
Professor Dayton!

115
00:10:10.285 --> 00:10:12.121
Professor?

116
00:10:12.205 --> 00:10:13.872
Professor?

117
00:10:22.461 --> 00:10:25.715
I only know her number
on speed dial.


118
00:10:25.757 --> 00:10:27.215
Police!

119
00:10:29.591 --> 00:10:32.051
- Hello?
- 911, what is your emergency?


120
00:10:32.093 --> 00:10:33.385
Please, you have to help me.

121
00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:35.011
Hello?

122
00:10:35.095 --> 00:10:37.388
- Hello? Send somebody.
- Hello? Someone there?


123
00:10:54.484 --> 00:10:57.735
He's getting married?
That's fucked up.


124
00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:34.051
Delivery for Professor...
Dayton?


125
00:11:37.137 --> 00:11:38.804
Are you supposed
to be here, miss?


126
00:11:38.887 --> 00:11:40.807
Oh my God.

127
00:11:40.848 --> 00:11:42.809
You have to help me.

128
00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:46.102
Hold on, I'll be
right back, okay?


129
00:11:46.185 --> 00:11:47.812
Hold on.

130
00:12:15.371 --> 00:12:17.206
Okay.

131
00:12:48.185 --> 00:12:49.810
What a weird looking remote.

132
00:12:49.895 --> 00:12:52.606
So far it doesn't do much.
Can't even change the channels.


133
00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:54.022
Take it to the professor.

134
00:12:54.107 --> 00:12:56.232
It was a five-mile walk

135
00:12:56.315 --> 00:12:58.277
to the nearest TV set,

136
00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:01.402
barefoot in the winter.

137
00:13:03.321 --> 00:13:05.864
And we all knew
the piano player


138
00:13:05.948 --> 00:13:09.033
with the candelabra
was a pansy.


139
00:13:09.116 --> 00:13:11.535
Just like your Uncle Brett.

140
00:13:11.577 --> 00:13:14.411
What a faggot he was.

141
00:13:14.495 --> 00:13:16.997
Grandma!

142
00:13:17.079 --> 00:13:18.540
Work, damn it.

143
00:13:18.582 --> 00:13:20.749
No!

144
00:13:20.832 --> 00:13:22.375
Good going, Dad.
You just turned off the TV set.


145
00:13:24.085 --> 00:13:25.710
Lewis!

146
00:13:40.597 --> 00:13:43.598
Mom, it's me!
It's Alice!


147
00:13:43.681 --> 00:13:44.932
It's me!

148
00:13:45.015 --> 00:13:46.976
Grab the gun, Lewis!

149
00:13:47.059 --> 00:13:48.851
- Grab it!
- Dad, hurry!


150
00:14:04.321 --> 00:14:06.698
Ow!

151
00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:09.575
Hello, Alice.

152
00:14:09.658 --> 00:14:12.701
Isn't the detective's
gadget a riot?


153
00:14:15.912 --> 00:14:17.996
Grab your gun!

154
00:14:23.292 --> 00:14:25.251
Shoot the damn
thing already!


155
00:14:25.334 --> 00:14:28.088
Please, I just
want to be normal.


156
00:14:29.546 --> 00:14:31.506
But you already are, Alice.

157
00:14:33.008 --> 00:14:34.508
This is who you are.

158
00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:49.851
Professor, don't go
near that thing!


159
00:14:52.644 --> 00:14:55.232
It's all right,
Detective Jacobs.


160
00:14:55.273 --> 00:14:58.276
This sweet little thing
is completely harmless.


161
00:14:58.359 --> 00:14:59.943
What is it?

162
00:15:00.027 --> 00:15:02.443
It's a rabbit, of course.

163
00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:08.490
Oh, it is...
it is a rabbit.


164
00:15:08.572 --> 00:15:11.241
What's...
what's his name?


165
00:15:11.325 --> 00:15:14.284
Alice.

166
00:15:14.369 --> 00:15:16.869
Her name is Alice.

167
00:15:18.996 --> 00:15:20.456
You bad girl,

168
00:15:20.498 --> 00:15:23.250
chewing through
your cage like that.


169
00:15:23.333 --> 00:15:25.835
I've been looking
all over for you.


170
00:15:25.918 --> 00:15:27.920
Oh, look what I've got.

171
00:15:28.002 --> 00:15:29.754
Your favorite toy.

172
00:15:29.838 --> 00:15:31.298
What a character.

173
00:15:32.632 --> 00:15:35.467
Alice.
What a pretty name.


174
00:16:07.196 --> 00:16:08.823
I ain't playing with you.

175
00:16:08.906 --> 00:16:11.906
Get in that damn street
and make my fucking money!


176
00:16:19.831 --> 00:16:21.623
Is there a problem?

177
00:16:21.665 --> 00:16:24.040
Fuck.

178
00:16:26.085 --> 00:16:28.001
Hey!
Hey!


179
00:16:29.628 --> 00:16:32.129
- I said, is there a fucking problem?
- No, no problem.


180
00:16:32.213 --> 00:16:34.298
Damn right there ain't
no fucking problem.


181
00:16:34.382 --> 00:16:36.633
Yeah.

182
00:16:36.716 --> 00:16:38.634
Hey, man.
Hey, listen.


183
00:16:38.675 --> 00:16:40.843
Hey, you looking
for some companionship?


184
00:16:40.926 --> 00:16:43.220
- No thanks.
- No, man, I can set you up.


185
00:16:43.302 --> 00:16:45.389
- I've seen you lookin', man.
- I'm good.


186
00:16:45.473 --> 00:16:47.640
Yeah?
Come on, man.


187
00:16:47.723 --> 00:16:49.686
Whatever you want.
Where are you?


188
00:16:49.726 --> 00:16:52.144
Hey.
Hey, bitch!


189
00:16:52.186 --> 00:16:54.187
You got a permit
to work my building?


190
00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:56.939
Hey!
What the hell?


191
00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:12.115
Hey, Jerry.

192
00:17:14.075 --> 00:17:16.660
Eva!
Get your ass down here.


193
00:17:16.742 --> 00:17:18.619
I'm coming.

194
00:17:20.455 --> 00:17:23.664
Bye, Jerry.

195
00:17:23.747 --> 00:17:25.333
Eva!

196
00:17:25.416 --> 00:17:27.668
I'm coming.

197
00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:30.418
Fuck!

198
00:17:45.054 --> 00:17:47.055
Oh, man. Fuck.

199
00:18:29.918 --> 00:18:32.711
...and now a foul
call against Martinez.


200
00:18:39.799 --> 00:18:41.676
Damn it.

201
00:18:51.892 --> 00:18:53.685
God damn it.

202
00:19:19.328 --> 00:19:22.412
- Yo, yo!
- Got change?


203
00:19:22.495 --> 00:19:24.747
Come on, young man,
buy something!


204
00:19:24.831 --> 00:19:27.664
- Fuck you.
- Buy something.


205
00:19:27.748 --> 00:19:30.918
Oh, take a look.
Take a look.


206
00:19:31.002 --> 00:19:33.253
Look,
it's a nice radio.


207
00:19:33.295 --> 00:19:36.672
- Yo, yo.
- Lady, lady, lady.


208
00:19:36.755 --> 00:19:38.422
See anything you like?

209
00:19:38.506 --> 00:19:41.258
Got a crystal ball.

210
00:19:41.343 --> 00:19:43.801
Book on voodoo.

211
00:19:43.843 --> 00:19:45.594
Anybody piss you off lately?

212
00:19:48.097 --> 00:19:50.973
I don't read much.
What do you want for the radio?


213
00:19:51.055 --> 00:19:53.600
Radio with the antenna...

214
00:19:53.642 --> 00:19:55.643
$5 going with
the antenna.


215
00:19:55.726 --> 00:19:57.145
Without the antenna...

216
00:19:57.186 --> 00:20:00.521
without the antenna,
is $10.


217
00:20:03.481 --> 00:20:05.151
Why is the one
with the antenna less?


218
00:20:05.234 --> 00:20:06.943
Less radio.

219
00:20:06.985 --> 00:20:10.737
All you need is duct tape
and a piece of wire.


220
00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:12.613
Make an antenna.

221
00:20:12.655 --> 00:20:15.946
I'll go less radio
more antenna.


222
00:20:19.118 --> 00:20:22.078
Give me the money.
Give me the money.


223
00:20:23.872 --> 00:20:26.165
Keep the change.

224
00:20:26.248 --> 00:20:28.875
Fuck you too!
Ya!


225
00:20:28.958 --> 00:20:30.708
Yeah, yeah.

226
00:20:30.792 --> 00:20:33.168
What a smart-ass
he was.


227
00:20:33.252 --> 00:20:36.129
Smart-ass!
Ya!


228
00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:41.551
Somebody buy something!
Come on!


229
00:21:19.910 --> 00:21:21.786
Oh no, no, no, no.

230
00:21:23.454 --> 00:21:26.038
Oh, come on.

231
00:21:31.167 --> 00:21:34.545
Of course.
Why wouldn't you do that?


232
00:21:34.628 --> 00:21:37.252
Thank you.

233
00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:06.691
You motherfucker.

234
00:22:06.774 --> 00:22:09.150
Don't.

235
00:22:32.957 --> 00:22:36.293
- Stop that.
- Whoa! Jesus!


236
00:23:05.355 --> 00:23:07.023
Hello?

237
00:23:12.903 --> 00:23:15.738
Hello?

238
00:24:06.022 --> 00:24:08.107
Don't.

239
00:24:11.317 --> 00:24:14.278
I said don't.
You'll like the song.


240
00:24:16.863 --> 00:24:19.489
You're getting water
on the floor.


241
00:24:19.573 --> 00:24:21.408
Oh, shit.

242
00:24:24.034 --> 00:24:25.992
Sorry.

243
00:24:26.034 --> 00:24:28.412
Dry yourself off.

244
00:24:34.041 --> 00:24:36.167
In the bathroom, Jerry.

245
00:24:58.265 --> 00:25:01.977
And, Jerry,
put some clothes on.


246
00:25:05.688 --> 00:25:07.982
Okay.

247
00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:18.946
- Well?
- What?


248
00:25:19.029 --> 00:25:21.157
Isn't it better now
that it's clean in here?


249
00:25:21.198 --> 00:25:22.740
I guess.

250
00:25:22.824 --> 00:25:25.659
You guess?
You're not sure?


251
00:25:25.742 --> 00:25:27.618
It's better.

252
00:25:27.703 --> 00:25:29.579
Are you hungry?

253
00:25:29.663 --> 00:25:32.999
- I guess so.
- Are you hungry or not?


254
00:25:33.082 --> 00:25:35.832
- I am.
- Then make dinner.


255
00:25:37.083 --> 00:25:39.334
All right.

256
00:25:43.087 --> 00:25:46.632
It's too hot for soup.
Make a sandwich.


257
00:25:46.716 --> 00:25:48.425
Jesus.

258
00:25:50.093 --> 00:25:52.554
I'm just looking
out for you, Jerry.


259
00:25:52.636 --> 00:25:55.138
I promise.

260
00:26:10.814 --> 00:26:12.732
Do you want one?

261
00:26:12.774 --> 00:26:14.859
Don't be ridiculous.

262
00:26:23.073 --> 00:26:25.575
Don't use so
much mayonnaise.


263
00:26:25.616 --> 00:26:27.367
It always gives
you a tummy ache.


264
00:26:28.828 --> 00:26:30.412
Right.

265
00:26:30.496 --> 00:26:32.872
Right.

266
00:26:34.913 --> 00:26:37.167
You wanna put some
money in tech stocks.


267
00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:38.792
They'll never go away.

268
00:26:38.876 --> 00:26:41.544
But the important
thing is to diversify.


269
00:26:41.585 --> 00:26:43.838
Right, diversify.

270
00:26:43.922 --> 00:26:45.631
I'll need more
money though.


271
00:26:45.714 --> 00:26:48.381
You'll have it.

272
00:26:49.841 --> 00:26:51.886
Yeah, Eddie, Eddie,
listen to me, baby.


273
00:26:51.969 --> 00:26:54.053
You're gonna love this.
It's a new reality series...


274
00:26:54.137 --> 00:26:56.180
"Home Invasion. "
We break into their homes,


275
00:26:56.263 --> 00:26:57.764
they don't even know
it's really us,


276
00:26:57.847 --> 00:26:59.430
we beat the crap
out of the family!


277
00:26:59.515 --> 00:27:01.683
- Right, we get the cameras 24/7.
- Sir, sir,


278
00:27:01.767 --> 00:27:04.393
this is a handicapped spot.

279
00:27:06.102 --> 00:27:08.396
Three-camera shoot.
They're gonna love it.


280
00:27:08.438 --> 00:27:10.772
Yeah, they're
gonna love it.


281
00:27:10.855 --> 00:27:12.733
Douche.

282
00:27:22.114 --> 00:27:24.574
I hate this guy.

283
00:27:24.615 --> 00:27:26.242
You say something?

284
00:27:26.282 --> 00:27:28.284
No.

285
00:27:30.454 --> 00:27:33.455
I was just taking
out the trash.


286
00:27:33.538 --> 00:27:35.539
Fuck you.

287
00:27:37.456 --> 00:27:39.750
Eva!

288
00:27:39.834 --> 00:27:41.876
Eva!

289
00:27:41.962 --> 00:27:44.545
I'm coming! Fuck!

290
00:27:46.047 --> 00:27:49.090
Say hi to your
little friend, Jerry.


291
00:28:05.518 --> 00:28:07.770
Hi, Jerry.

292
00:28:07.811 --> 00:28:09.728
Hi.

293
00:28:09.811 --> 00:28:11.773
Eva!

294
00:28:11.813 --> 00:28:13.483
Fuck.

295
00:28:30.035 --> 00:28:32.369
Nice job, Jerry.

296
00:28:36.955 --> 00:28:39.123
Let me in!

297
00:28:39.207 --> 00:28:40.917
You ain't got
shit without me.


298
00:28:41.001 --> 00:28:43.211
I'll fucking kill you!

299
00:28:43.295 --> 00:28:46.963
What are we gonna do about
all that banging, Jerry?


300
00:28:47.046 --> 00:28:48.339
Ronald!

301
00:28:48.422 --> 00:28:50.840
Tell her to knock it off.

302
00:28:50.882 --> 00:28:53.635
- Ronald!
- Knock it off!


303
00:29:13.523 --> 00:29:15.650
Let's go.

304
00:29:25.572 --> 00:29:27.365
And get a flashlight.

305
00:29:31.326 --> 00:29:34.035
- Don't be seen.
- Got it.


306
00:29:41.375 --> 00:29:44.086
What do you see,
Jerry?


307
00:29:44.169 --> 00:29:46.838
- I'm looking.
- Don't look yet.


308
00:29:46.922 --> 00:29:50.089
Just see.

309
00:29:54.425 --> 00:29:56.760
I see a clothesline,

310
00:29:56.843 --> 00:30:00.054
some garbage,
box spring,


311
00:30:00.137 --> 00:30:02.721
Mandy drunk,

312
00:30:02.806 --> 00:30:04.767
passed out again.

313
00:30:06.767 --> 00:30:10.229
I see a stairwell leading
to a fire escape.


314
00:30:10.271 --> 00:30:12.939
Look at the stairs.

315
00:30:15.399 --> 00:30:18.860
Looks like a bunch of people threw
a bunch of shit down here.


316
00:30:18.943 --> 00:30:21.650
- Look again.
- I'm looking.


317
00:30:23.402 --> 00:30:26.529
This looks intentional.

318
00:30:26.613 --> 00:30:30.199
Keep climbing, Jerry.

319
00:30:30.241 --> 00:30:32.118
I'm climbing.

320
00:30:34.412 --> 00:30:37.204
Shh.

321
00:30:42.292 --> 00:30:45.544
Keep climbing.

322
00:30:45.586 --> 00:30:48.295
Okay.

323
00:30:48.379 --> 00:30:51.338
Keep climbing, Jerry.

324
00:30:51.422 --> 00:30:54.758
- Up there?
- Yes, up there.


325
00:30:56.926 --> 00:31:00.387
Okay.
Okay.


326
00:31:12.770 --> 00:31:16.232
Well, what are
you waiting for?


327
00:31:16.316 --> 00:31:18.274
Up there?

328
00:31:18.316 --> 00:31:20.568
It doesn't look safe.

329
00:31:20.651 --> 00:31:23.111
Are you afraid, Jerry?

330
00:31:23.193 --> 00:31:25.236
- No.
- Well then, let's go.


331
00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:28.115
All right.
Fine.


332
00:32:27.906 --> 00:32:31.366
It's all right.
Relax.


333
00:32:31.449 --> 00:32:33.992
Now get the flashlight.

334
00:32:38.495 --> 00:32:41.290
And watch out
for more cats.


335
00:33:05.848 --> 00:33:07.763
- Fuck, man!
- It's only


336
00:33:07.847 --> 00:33:10.601
a dead squirrel, Jerry.

337
00:33:10.684 --> 00:33:11.935
That thing is huge.

338
00:33:12.017 --> 00:33:16.187
- Next time you see one, kill it.
- Fine.


339
00:33:16.271 --> 00:33:17.690
What'll you do when
you see another one?


340
00:33:17.773 --> 00:33:20.774
- Kill the little fucker.
- That's right.


341
00:33:20.858 --> 00:33:23.360
Now breathe, Jerry.

342
00:33:24.569 --> 00:33:28.029
Now get your flashlight
and let's try again.


343
00:33:53.756 --> 00:33:55.716
I told you
I'd take care of you.


344
00:33:55.798 --> 00:33:57.841
Now let's get out
of here quick.


345
00:34:17.729 --> 00:34:20.107
- You'll have to kill him.
- What?


346
00:34:20.190 --> 00:34:23.525
- No.
- You have to. He saw the box.


347
00:34:23.567 --> 00:34:25.735
He saw the money.

348
00:34:31.906 --> 00:34:34.449
- You have to.
- You don't know what he saw.


349
00:34:34.532 --> 00:34:37.201
Come on, Jerry,
you know exactly what he saw.


350
00:34:37.284 --> 00:34:39.787
And so does he.
Sooner or later,


351
00:34:39.871 --> 00:34:42.705
- he's gonna come for it.
- I won't do it.


352
00:34:42.746 --> 00:34:45.665
Well, it's too late now,
he's gone.


353
00:34:45.749 --> 00:34:48.250
But he'll be back, Jerry.
Don't you worry.


354
00:34:48.333 --> 00:34:51.379
This is bad.

355
00:34:51.461 --> 00:34:54.296
There's over 300 grand here.

356
00:34:54.379 --> 00:34:55.796
The big move
will be real estate


357
00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:58.632
and income property,
a duplex at least.


358
00:34:58.714 --> 00:35:01.885
But like I said,
it's all about how we diversify.


359
00:35:01.968 --> 00:35:05.302
- Right, long-term goals.
- Exactly.


360
00:35:05.386 --> 00:35:07.849
We should leave town
as soon as possible.


361
00:35:07.932 --> 00:35:10.599
Wait, do you hear that?

362
00:35:10.682 --> 00:35:12.809
- What?
- Listen.


363
00:35:12.893 --> 00:35:14.728
Someone is breaking in.

364
00:35:14.810 --> 00:35:17.228
Guess who.

365
00:35:17.313 --> 00:35:20.899
Don't shoot him.
That'd be bad.


366
00:35:22.357 --> 00:35:24.607
- What do I do?
- You'll know what to do.


367
00:35:24.691 --> 00:35:26.443
But do it fast!

368
00:35:44.956 --> 00:35:47.582
Jerry, get back inside

369
00:35:47.666 --> 00:35:49.459
and get the knife.

370
00:35:49.542 --> 00:35:51.919
No.

371
00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:54.671
Good.

372
00:35:56.297 --> 00:35:58.297
Ronald!

373
00:36:05.844 --> 00:36:07.806
You did what
you had to do.


374
00:36:07.890 --> 00:36:11.222
- This has gone too far.
- You did the right thing.


375
00:36:11.307 --> 00:36:12.558
This is crazy.

376
00:36:12.642 --> 00:36:14.684
Jerry, there's gonna
be cops everywhere.


377
00:36:14.768 --> 00:36:18.437
You have to relax.
You have to be cool.


378
00:36:18.521 --> 00:36:20.773
- Focus.
- Focus.


379
00:36:20.812 --> 00:36:23.148
I know.
You're right.


380
00:36:23.231 --> 00:36:24.900
No loose ends.

381
00:36:24.983 --> 00:36:26.942
You knew this going in.

382
00:36:29.026 --> 00:36:30.987
I know.

383
00:36:38.118 --> 00:36:40.119
Murder-suicide?

384
00:36:40.619 --> 00:36:43.787
Yeah, well, that's
what it looks like.


385
00:36:43.871 --> 00:36:45.872
Tied her up
with duct tape,


386
00:36:45.955 --> 00:36:48.457
stabbed her about

387
00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:51.793
Lots of blood.

388
00:36:51.834 --> 00:36:54.337
That's a new brand
of sick.


389
00:36:54.378 --> 00:36:57.839
Nah, it's not so new.
Word is they had a drug problem.


390
00:36:57.880 --> 00:37:00.841
- They fought a lot. That sort of thing.
- I knew about the drugs.


391
00:37:00.882 --> 00:37:03.884
Everybody heard
the fighting.


392
00:37:03.967 --> 00:37:05.928
Yeah.

393
00:37:10.763 --> 00:37:12.473
Got any more milk?

394
00:37:12.557 --> 00:37:15.309
I'm afraid this is
the last of it.


395
00:37:16.393 --> 00:37:19.645
Right. Well...

396
00:37:20.978 --> 00:37:23.939
- thanks for your time.
- Not a problem.


397
00:37:29.986 --> 00:37:31.945
Sticky.

398
00:37:38.575 --> 00:37:41.327
Oh, um...

399
00:37:41.410 --> 00:37:44.454
if you think
of anything,


400
00:37:44.537 --> 00:37:45.788
here's my card.

401
00:37:45.871 --> 00:37:49.165
Sure thing,
Officer Jacobs.


402
00:37:49.249 --> 00:37:51.082
Detective.

403
00:37:51.165 --> 00:37:52.876
Oh, right.

404
00:37:52.959 --> 00:37:56.210
- Detective.
- Yeah.


405
00:38:07.595 --> 00:38:10.013
He found tape residue
on the chair.


406
00:38:10.096 --> 00:38:13.265
- I saw that.
- I don't know if he put it together.


407
00:38:13.349 --> 00:38:15.016
This guy's hard to read.

408
00:38:18.101 --> 00:38:20.560
Stay cool, Jerry.

409
00:38:31.110 --> 00:38:33.736
I got one...

410
00:38:35.113 --> 00:38:36.947
You found some
more milk?


411
00:38:37.031 --> 00:38:38.616
You caught me.

412
00:38:38.699 --> 00:38:42.410
I just have
one more question.


413
00:38:42.493 --> 00:38:45.369
Leon Cates...
you know him?


414
00:38:45.452 --> 00:38:47.079
- The guy across the hall?
- Yeah, that's him.


415
00:38:47.163 --> 00:38:50.374
Pimp, drug dealer,

416
00:38:50.416 --> 00:38:52.084
among other things.

417
00:38:52.167 --> 00:38:55.585
Seems really bent out of shape.
Won't tell me exactly why.


418
00:38:55.669 --> 00:38:57.794
Don't think I've ever
seen him happy.


419
00:38:57.877 --> 00:39:00.047
I know the type.

420
00:39:00.088 --> 00:39:03.048
This is different.

421
00:39:03.090 --> 00:39:05.051
Anything comes to mind...

422
00:39:05.094 --> 00:39:07.719
- I'll give you a call.
- Right.


423
00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:09.303
Got one.

424
00:39:10.637 --> 00:39:13.056
Oh, that's right.

425
00:39:13.139 --> 00:39:15.975
Yeah.

426
00:39:16.059 --> 00:39:19.018
You do.

427
00:39:23.979 --> 00:39:26.815
Looks like someone
tried to break in.


428
00:39:26.898 --> 00:39:29.442
I saw that last night.

429
00:39:29.525 --> 00:39:32.317
Not much use reporting
it. Nothing personal.


430
00:39:32.402 --> 00:39:35.071
Oh, right.

431
00:39:35.112 --> 00:39:38.948
Well, you have
a good day, Mr...


432
00:39:39.031 --> 00:39:40.908
Collins.

433
00:39:40.949 --> 00:39:42.909
Same to you, sir.

434
00:39:42.950 --> 00:39:45.119
Well, thank you.

435
00:39:58.128 --> 00:40:00.880
I feel good
about this.


436
00:40:00.963 --> 00:40:03.925
Me too.

437
00:40:22.811 --> 00:40:26.397
I'll stay with the money.
You go check that we got everything.


438
00:40:32.026 --> 00:40:34.361
- Are you moving?
- Yeah.


439
00:40:34.444 --> 00:40:37.822
Things have just
gotten a little nutty around here.


440
00:40:37.905 --> 00:40:39.365
Yeah.

441
00:40:39.450 --> 00:40:41.366
I guess I wanted to
for a while.


442
00:40:41.450 --> 00:40:43.201
Been saving.

443
00:40:43.284 --> 00:40:46.161
Where you moving to?

444
00:40:46.245 --> 00:40:47.829
I'm not sure yet.

445
00:40:47.912 --> 00:40:50.621
I just figure I'll keep driving until
I find someplace,


446
00:40:50.662 --> 00:40:53.958
someplace I can afford
some property.


447
00:40:53.998 --> 00:40:56.625
I can't stay here,
Jerry.


448
00:40:56.666 --> 00:40:58.502
Leon will kill me.

449
00:40:58.585 --> 00:41:01.963
He thinks I took
his money.


450
00:41:02.004 --> 00:41:04.798
His money?

451
00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:07.758
Armored-car heist
almost two years ago.


452
00:41:07.841 --> 00:41:10.969
He's got a half a million
stashed in a building up on Hill St.


453
00:41:11.052 --> 00:41:14.262
I don't know where
the rest of it is.


454
00:41:15.889 --> 00:41:18.224
It'll turn up someday.

455
00:41:18.308 --> 00:41:21.727
You got room
for one more, Jerry?


456
00:41:26.313 --> 00:41:28.273
You can't come back.

457
00:41:32.943 --> 00:41:35.110
I don't want to.

458
00:41:39.281 --> 00:41:41.158
What is it with you?

459
00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:43.700
She'll kill you as soon as she finds
out about the money.


460
00:41:43.782 --> 00:41:45.659
You'll have to
kill her first.


461
00:41:45.701 --> 00:41:47.493
No, I think
I trust her.


462
00:41:47.577 --> 00:41:51.121
She's a whore.
You can't trust a whore, Jerry.


463
00:41:51.206 --> 00:41:54.414
I said no.

464
00:41:54.498 --> 00:41:57.083
Let's get out
of here fast.


465
00:42:02.173 --> 00:42:04.382
Don't look at me like that.
I need to go pee now.


466
00:42:05.881 --> 00:42:08.635
Just pull over right here.
There's nobody here.


467
00:42:08.718 --> 00:42:10.885
- It's not a big deal.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.


468
00:42:10.968 --> 00:42:14.889
Don't be sorry.
Just gonna take two seconds, all right?


469
00:42:14.972 --> 00:42:17.139
- Be right back.
- No problem.


470
00:42:17.222 --> 00:42:18.848
Wait here.

471
00:42:24.309 --> 00:42:26.313
Now I'm in the back seat.

472
00:42:26.396 --> 00:42:29.356
Next it'll be the trash.
You have to listen to me.


473
00:42:29.439 --> 00:42:31.565
- I think you're jealous.
- Your little friend isn't gonna


474
00:42:31.649 --> 00:42:34.152
understand our relationship, Jerry.
Think about it.


475
00:42:34.235 --> 00:42:35.903
I'm only trying
to help you.


476
00:42:35.985 --> 00:42:37.904
Let her take a piss,
for fuck's sake.


477
00:42:37.987 --> 00:42:40.739
It's the middle of nowhere.
Do it now!


478
00:44:08.298 --> 00:44:11.257
What did I say?
Just be cool.


479
00:44:11.340 --> 00:44:14.135
Temperance will see you
through most things.


480
00:44:14.220 --> 00:44:17.262
You know, it's all
about the future now.


481
00:44:17.345 --> 00:44:19.431
Yeah, the future.

482
00:44:19.515 --> 00:44:21.765
Exactly, the future.

483
00:44:21.807 --> 00:44:24.602
Long-term
sustained growth.


484
00:44:24.685 --> 00:44:26.895
And how we
gonna do that?


485
00:44:26.978 --> 00:44:29.436
- Diversify?
- Damn straight,


486
00:44:29.478 --> 00:44:31.399
diversify.

487
00:44:31.482 --> 00:44:35.024
Stocks, bonds and of course,
real estate.


488
00:44:35.108 --> 00:44:37.693
We're talking a wide array
of growth industry


489
00:44:37.777 --> 00:44:41.112
as well as the more steady,
conservative investment.


490
00:44:41.195 --> 00:44:45.114
Don't even fuck
with commodities.


491
00:44:45.197 --> 00:44:48.242
They're just gonna get you
in trouble.


492
00:45:23.764 --> 00:45:25.684
Yeah, this is Rachael.

493
00:45:25.767 --> 00:45:29.477
I'm looking
for some companionship


494
00:45:29.519 --> 00:45:31.314
for the night.

495
00:45:34.482 --> 00:45:36.942
Where are you?

496
00:45:37.025 --> 00:45:39.151
I'm at home.

497
00:45:39.235 --> 00:45:42.030
Hey, bitch, you got a permit to work
in my building?


498
00:45:42.113 --> 00:45:44.573
Sorry, I've never
done this before.


499
00:45:44.655 --> 00:45:47.240
Hey hey, trick!

500
00:45:47.324 --> 00:45:48.784
Don't you walk away
from me now.


501
00:45:48.868 --> 00:45:52.743
Well, there was
this one time...


502
00:45:54.038 --> 00:45:55.329
Where are you?

503
00:45:55.371 --> 00:45:57.330
What is this?

504
00:45:57.372 --> 00:45:59.665
- In the movies...
- Mm-hmm.


505
00:45:59.707 --> 00:46:03.168
...we use big cameras.
- What the fuck is this?


506
00:46:03.210 --> 00:46:06.921
What the fuck is this?
Are you paying? Are you paying?


507
00:46:07.004 --> 00:46:09.004
Where's home, dipshit?

508
00:46:09.088 --> 00:46:11.298
Do you accept the Lord
Jesus Christ


509
00:46:11.382 --> 00:46:14.343
...as your personal lord and savior?
- Excuse me one moment, please.


510
00:46:14.384 --> 00:46:16.385
Whore!

511
00:46:16.469 --> 00:46:19.179
Get the fuck out of here.
I ain't playing with you!


512
00:46:19.262 --> 00:46:21.180
Get out of here.
What the hell?


513
00:46:21.221 --> 00:46:22.722
He was gonna
make me a star.


514
00:46:22.804 --> 00:46:25.516
Get in that damn street
and make my fucking money.


515
00:46:25.599 --> 00:46:27.642
I ain't playing
with you.


516
00:46:29.852 --> 00:46:32.021
Repent, vixen of Satan.

517
00:46:32.104 --> 00:46:34.855
Repent!

518
00:46:34.897 --> 00:46:38.735
Repent!
The end is near!


519
00:46:48.199 --> 00:46:50.740
Is everything okay?

520
00:46:50.825 --> 00:46:53.285
- What was that?
- Everything's cool.


521
00:46:53.369 --> 00:46:55.495
So how do I get
to your place, lover?


522
00:46:55.578 --> 00:46:58.580
I live at...

523
00:46:58.663 --> 00:47:01.708
uh, 26 Cabrillo Avenue.

524
00:47:01.791 --> 00:47:04.626
- By the marina?
- Yeah, how'd you know?


525
00:47:04.711 --> 00:47:08.337
Lucky guess.
Have a few clients there.


526
00:47:08.420 --> 00:47:11.215
Okay, give me 15.

527
00:47:11.298 --> 00:47:13.050
Bye.

528
00:47:21.428 --> 00:47:24.141
Gotta get some.

529
00:47:29.476 --> 00:47:31.644
Gotta shower first.

530
00:47:52.199 --> 00:47:54.076
Breaking news just in.

531
00:47:54.117 --> 00:47:56.994
Authorities believe
that the latest rash of serial murders


532
00:47:57.077 --> 00:47:58.746
have been committed
by a woman.


533
00:47:58.788 --> 00:48:00.582
They believe she may be
a prostitute


534
00:48:00.665 --> 00:48:04.084
and the local tabloids have dubbed
the culprit the "Call-Girl Killer. "


535
00:48:04.126 --> 00:48:07.461
She has claimed

536
00:48:07.544 --> 00:48:09.044
Now back
to Jim in sports.


537
00:48:09.128 --> 00:48:11.130
It's about time.

538
00:48:12.757 --> 00:48:15.174
"The Call-Girl Killer, "
huh?


539
00:48:18.927 --> 00:48:20.884
How original.

540
00:48:31.644 --> 00:48:34.437
- Look at that.
- Check this out.


541
00:48:34.479 --> 00:48:36.189
- '88, right?
- Yeah.


542
00:48:36.272 --> 00:48:39.316
But did you see the girl
that's sitting in there?


543
00:48:56.161 --> 00:48:58.622
You boys gonna be
around later?


544
00:48:58.663 --> 00:49:01.748
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

545
00:49:32.643 --> 00:49:36.230
- Victor?
- Yeah.


546
00:49:36.313 --> 00:49:38.647
How'd you guess?

547
00:49:40.024 --> 00:49:42.024
Lucky guess.

548
00:49:48.905 --> 00:49:52.492
Nice house.
Is it yours?


549
00:49:52.575 --> 00:49:54.616
Yeah, why?

550
00:49:54.699 --> 00:49:56.659
Where are your parents?

551
00:49:58.454 --> 00:50:00.622
My parents are out
of town for the weekend.


552
00:50:01.705 --> 00:50:04.458
Is it that obvious?

553
00:50:11.712 --> 00:50:15.256
How come you're not
in any of the pictures?


554
00:50:15.339 --> 00:50:17.798
I'm...

555
00:50:17.884 --> 00:50:19.842
I'm kind of the black sheep
of the family.


556
00:50:19.884 --> 00:50:22.845
The clan's more proud
of my brother.


557
00:50:22.887 --> 00:50:26.264
He's the family
success story.


558
00:50:28.058 --> 00:50:30.099
Which makes you
the screw up, huh?


559
00:50:31.975 --> 00:50:35.145
- Yeah.
- Yeah.


560
00:50:37.395 --> 00:50:39.857
So how about we get
to it


561
00:50:39.898 --> 00:50:41.857
since I'm on the clock?

562
00:50:44.233 --> 00:50:46.151
Okay, I'm just used

563
00:50:46.235 --> 00:50:48.196
to a little more
discussion, you know?


564
00:50:48.279 --> 00:50:49.947
Well, I'm...

565
00:50:50.030 --> 00:50:52.282
I'm a little short
on cash, so, uh...


566
00:50:52.365 --> 00:50:55.532
Okay, junior.

567
00:50:55.615 --> 00:50:58.494
Whatever floats your boat.

568
00:50:59.662 --> 00:51:01.663
Let's head upstairs.

569
00:51:15.089 --> 00:51:18.715
So, how about we get
that transaction out of the way?


570
00:51:20.342 --> 00:51:23.219
- Business first.
- Right.


571
00:51:30.056 --> 00:51:32.017
Here you are,
Miss Rachael.


572
00:51:33.810 --> 00:51:35.852
$1,000 it is.

573
00:51:36.937 --> 00:51:40.188
So this your
first time?


574
00:51:42.107 --> 00:51:43.858
Yeah.

575
00:51:43.942 --> 00:51:44.900
How'd you know?

576
00:51:44.942 --> 00:51:48.153
Lucky guess.

577
00:51:48.236 --> 00:51:51.197
So what are we
gonna do?


578
00:51:52.738 --> 00:51:55.197
Oh...

579
00:51:55.281 --> 00:51:57.909
Well, I'd like you

580
00:51:57.951 --> 00:52:00.787
to tie me to the bed
and ride me.


581
00:52:00.869 --> 00:52:04.706
But, well, you have to blindfold
me first.


582
00:52:04.789 --> 00:52:07.248
Ooh, that sounds kinky.

583
00:52:07.332 --> 00:52:10.250
For $1,000 bucks
it's doable, right?


584
00:52:10.292 --> 00:52:12.294
Whatever you want,
baby.


585
00:52:19.464 --> 00:52:21.257
You like that, huh?

586
00:52:21.341 --> 00:52:23.301
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you do.


587
00:52:28.180 --> 00:52:31.724
You've been
a little naughty.


588
00:52:31.807 --> 00:52:33.558
Maybe.
Oh!


589
00:52:41.147 --> 00:52:43.106
Get it tight.

590
00:52:45.483 --> 00:52:48.777
How's that feel?

591
00:52:51.029 --> 00:52:53.404
Perfect.

592
00:52:53.487 --> 00:52:55.615
Are you getting
naked yet?


593
00:52:55.657 --> 00:52:57.783
Oh, in a second.

594
00:53:05.914 --> 00:53:07.873
Ooh!

595
00:53:20.923 --> 00:53:23.134
This is so great.

596
00:53:24.176 --> 00:53:26.136
Yeah.

597
00:53:27.428 --> 00:53:29.805
I'll make it
well worth your while.


598
00:53:31.932 --> 00:53:34.517
I don't doubt that
for a second.


599
00:53:43.689 --> 00:53:46.399
Baby, that tickles.

600
00:53:57.032 --> 00:53:58.950
What the hell
are you doing?


601
00:54:55.405 --> 00:54:57.364
How pathetic.

602
00:55:50.567 --> 00:55:52.527
Rachael.

603
00:56:05.578 --> 00:56:07.787
Rachael.

604
00:56:10.497 --> 00:56:12.541
Rachael.

605
00:56:16.166 --> 00:56:18.128
Rachael.

606
00:56:21.880 --> 00:56:23.925
Why did you
kill me, Rachael?


607
00:56:30.761 --> 00:56:32.720
Are you scared?

608
00:56:35.349 --> 00:56:37.933
'Cause you should be.

609
00:56:46.939 --> 00:56:49.858
Please don't kill me!
Please! I'm sorry!


610
00:56:49.900 --> 00:56:51.442
I'm sorry! Please!

611
00:56:51.526 --> 00:56:54.403
Please don't kill me.

612
00:57:00.407 --> 00:57:02.366
So, you know, she's
pushing the cart along


613
00:57:02.449 --> 00:57:05.494
and she thinks all's
okay and all's well and all's dandy.


614
00:57:05.577 --> 00:57:08.994
But then she goes and looks in the cart
and realizes it's not her baby in there,


615
00:57:09.079 --> 00:57:10.914
but a zebra.

616
00:57:14.417 --> 00:57:16.334
What do we got?
What do we got?


617
00:57:16.418 --> 00:57:19.544
Oh, man, all right.
Let's see, what do we got here?


618
00:57:23.674 --> 00:57:27.091
- What do we got? What do we got?
- A letter from your ex-wife.


619
00:57:27.133 --> 00:57:29.092
Three or seven,
which one?


620
00:57:38.598 --> 00:57:41.517
Who is that guy?

621
00:57:43.727 --> 00:57:45.771
Beats me.

622
00:57:49.606 --> 00:57:52.234
Look at this.
Your parole officer.


623
00:57:52.318 --> 00:57:54.277
Yeah, I know. I shouldn't have peed
in that swimming pool.


624
00:57:54.319 --> 00:57:56.277
All right,
what else we got?


625
00:58:32.134 --> 00:58:35.139
Professor Dayton.

626
00:58:35.222 --> 00:58:37.724
Professor Dayton.

627
00:58:44.060 --> 00:58:45.978
Dean Thompson.

628
00:58:46.062 --> 00:58:49.813
So when will we see
what you're doing in there?


629
00:58:49.897 --> 00:58:52.483
Well, as you know,
that's my deal with the university.


630
00:58:52.566 --> 00:58:55.277
I teach and you allow me
to work on my projects.


631
00:58:55.360 --> 00:58:59.279
I know, Dayton, but it's been
over 20 years.


632
00:58:59.320 --> 00:59:03.158
Well, actually,
you'll find out sooner than you think.


633
00:59:03.242 --> 00:59:05.282
You mean...

634
00:59:05.325 --> 00:59:07.368
Yes, very soon, indeed.

635
00:59:07.451 --> 00:59:09.411
Now what can I do
for you, Dean?


636
00:59:09.496 --> 00:59:12.371
Oh, almost forgot.

637
00:59:12.456 --> 00:59:15.415
I've got this wedding invitation
in the mail.


638
00:59:15.499 --> 00:59:18.457
Yes, I do hope
you can attend.


639
00:59:19.626 --> 00:59:22.505
This is not one
of your practical jokes?


640
00:59:22.547 --> 00:59:25.505
Oh, I assure you,
it is not.


641
00:59:25.547 --> 00:59:28.424
But when did you
have time to meet this woman?


642
00:59:28.508 --> 00:59:31.175
When you're not teaching,
you're here in the lab.


643
00:59:31.258 --> 00:59:33.554
Love has its ways.

644
00:59:33.636 --> 00:59:37.555
Of course, but, Professor,
at your age,


645
00:59:37.638 --> 00:59:40.391
- you're getting married?
- Already got the rings.


646
00:59:43.850 --> 00:59:45.978
I'll be there.

647
00:59:46.061 --> 00:59:48.187
Is it going to be
a big wedding?


648
00:59:48.270 --> 00:59:51.190
Just a few colleagues
and some of my former


649
00:59:51.274 --> 00:59:52.648
special students.

650
00:59:56.235 --> 00:59:59.446
- I guess congratulations are in order.
- Thank you.


651
01:00:20.711 --> 01:00:23.170
Looks exactly the same.

652
01:00:23.212 --> 01:00:26.298
I don't know.
I think that gray might be different.


653
01:00:33.428 --> 01:00:35.845
- Look at that.
- Check this out.


654
01:00:35.887 --> 01:00:38.139
- '88, right?
- Yeah.


655
01:00:38.222 --> 01:00:41.599
But did you see the girl
that's sitting in there?


656
01:00:43.308 --> 01:00:45.226
I don't care about the '88.
Check this out.


657
01:00:45.309 --> 01:00:49.019
Look at that.
Whoa, whoa.


658
01:00:54.358 --> 01:00:57.360
- This is his neighbor?
- I don't...


659
01:00:57.402 --> 01:01:00.404
- I don't... I don't know.
- Whoa, whoa.


660
01:01:00.446 --> 01:01:01.905
You boys gonna be
around later?


661
01:01:01.988 --> 01:01:05.365
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

662
01:01:07.659 --> 01:01:09.742
All right, let's go.
Come on.


663
01:01:09.825 --> 01:01:11.202
The professor's waiting.
Let's go.


664
01:01:11.244 --> 01:01:12.870
- Come on.
- Relax, man.


665
01:01:44.766 --> 01:01:46.058
Let me get it, dear.

666
01:01:46.143 --> 01:01:49.354
Oh, hi, boys. Come in, come in.
The door's open.


667
01:01:49.438 --> 01:01:51.689
Come on.

668
01:01:51.772 --> 01:01:55.108
Hey, Professor,
it's so good to see you.


669
01:01:55.192 --> 01:01:57.942
- Professor, you look great.
- You guys look great, too.


670
01:01:58.026 --> 01:02:00.361
Come in, come in,
come in.


671
01:02:00.444 --> 01:02:04.363
I'm so glad neither one of you were
too busy to come to town.


672
01:02:04.446 --> 01:02:07.406
- And miss your wedding?
- We wouldn't miss it for the world.


673
01:02:07.448 --> 01:02:09.409
This place looks
exactly the same.


674
01:02:09.450 --> 01:02:11.034
Brings back memories.

675
01:02:11.118 --> 01:02:13.994
When you two were
my smartest students,


676
01:02:14.078 --> 01:02:17.664
we'd sit around
and argue theories of evolution.


677
01:02:17.747 --> 01:02:19.333
But you would always
win the argument,


678
01:02:19.417 --> 01:02:21.252
even if sometimes
you were just pulling our leg.


679
01:02:21.335 --> 01:02:23.627
Well, I had to spice
things up a little.


680
01:02:23.710 --> 01:02:26.588
So, Professor, when are we
going to meet the lucky lady?


681
01:02:26.628 --> 01:02:28.337
Soon.

682
01:02:28.421 --> 01:02:32.465
Professor, how's your
secret experiment coming along?


683
01:02:32.550 --> 01:02:34.342
Oh, fine.

684
01:02:34.426 --> 01:02:36.010
Is it really for
the government, Professor?


685
01:02:37.386 --> 01:02:39.595
Do you remember the one
about you being


686
01:02:39.637 --> 01:02:41.636
- Dr. Frankenstein, Professor?
- Oh, yeah.


687
01:02:41.678 --> 01:02:43.348
If you only knew
the rumors about that.


688
01:02:43.431 --> 01:02:45.016
I knew about them.

689
01:02:45.099 --> 01:02:48.645
They couldn't come
between me and my work.


690
01:02:48.728 --> 01:02:52.147
Charles, John...

691
01:02:52.188 --> 01:02:54.356
I think it's finally done!

692
01:02:54.439 --> 01:02:56.107
Professor, that's great.

693
01:02:56.190 --> 01:02:58.150
Can you finally tell us?

694
01:02:58.234 --> 01:03:00.610
Soon, but you didn't
come here for that.


695
01:03:00.693 --> 01:03:02.152
You came for my wedding!

696
01:03:02.194 --> 01:03:04.112
- That's true.
- Of course.


697
01:03:04.153 --> 01:03:05.779
So tell us about
her, Professor.


698
01:03:05.862 --> 01:03:07.822
Is she a teacher
at the university?


699
01:03:07.863 --> 01:03:09.448
How did you meet her?

700
01:03:09.490 --> 01:03:12.202
Hold on, I'll tell
you everything.


701
01:03:12.285 --> 01:03:14.370
Let's see, first of all,

702
01:03:14.453 --> 01:03:17.287
she's not from around here.

703
01:03:17.328 --> 01:03:19.957
Did you meet her
on a sabbatical?


704
01:03:19.998 --> 01:03:22.375
John, the professor
doesn't do sabbaticals, am I right?


705
01:03:22.459 --> 01:03:25.043
- That's right.
- After all these years,


706
01:03:25.127 --> 01:03:26.586
we thought you were
a confirmed bachelor.


707
01:03:26.669 --> 01:03:28.128
So did I.

708
01:03:28.170 --> 01:03:31.546
Hello.

709
01:03:35.259 --> 01:03:38.386
I'm hope I'm not
interrupting your reunion.


710
01:03:38.469 --> 01:03:40.387
Honey, you could never
be an interruption.


711
01:03:40.470 --> 01:03:42.847
Charles, John,
I'd like you to meet Kathy,


712
01:03:42.888 --> 01:03:45.307
- my fiancée.
- Hello.


713
01:03:45.350 --> 01:03:47.476
- Nice to meet you.
- Pleasure to meet you too!


714
01:03:47.517 --> 01:03:49.811
- Hello.
- Hi.


715
01:03:49.895 --> 01:03:52.687
Oh, you really have
to try my pierogis


716
01:03:53.896 --> 01:03:55.647
Okay.

717
01:03:55.731 --> 01:03:58.233
Honey, can you
help me a moment?


718
01:03:58.316 --> 01:04:00.818
Oh, of course, sweetheart.
Boys, I'll be right back.


719
01:04:00.901 --> 01:04:03.819
You know where the bar is.
Help yourself.


720
01:04:07.323 --> 01:04:09.407
Okay is this a joke?

721
01:04:09.490 --> 01:04:11.659
I don't think so. I need a drink.
What're you drinking?


722
01:04:12.826 --> 01:04:15.493
A triple of whatever
that is.


723
01:04:17.455 --> 01:04:19.956
She's not even old enough
to be his granddaughter.


724
01:04:21.206 --> 01:04:23.418
Wait a minute.

725
01:04:23.501 --> 01:04:25.042
What?

726
01:04:27.918 --> 01:04:29.795
The prof did it.

727
01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:33.799
What're you talking about?

728
01:04:33.881 --> 01:04:35.591
Do you remember all the experiments
he's been working on?


729
01:04:35.674 --> 01:04:37.718
I don't know.
He was working on so many.


730
01:04:37.802 --> 01:04:39.176
I remember
the robotic stuff.


731
01:04:39.218 --> 01:04:41.721
- And?
- Then he would joke


732
01:04:41.763 --> 01:04:45.056
that he could create
the perfect woman.


733
01:04:45.138 --> 01:04:49.101
If I could create
the perfect woman,


734
01:04:49.184 --> 01:04:52.519
I'd make sure there was an on/off switch
in there somewhere.


735
01:04:54.729 --> 01:04:59.149
And a volume control.

736
01:05:07.737 --> 01:05:09.948
You got a better
explanation?


737
01:05:10.030 --> 01:05:11.907
You think?

738
01:05:11.992 --> 01:05:14.241
He's a freaking quantum engineer.
You know that.


739
01:05:14.325 --> 01:05:16.453
You and I have both seen
some of the stuff he's done.


740
01:05:16.536 --> 01:05:18.453
Yeah, but this?

741
01:05:18.537 --> 01:05:21.205
Again, do you have
a better explanation?


742
01:05:21.247 --> 01:05:24.373
No.

743
01:05:24.416 --> 01:05:27.626
But I'd say
good for the prof.


744
01:05:27.708 --> 01:05:31.462
You really have to try
my chicken dumplings.


745
01:05:31.547 --> 01:05:33.755
Oh, um...

746
01:05:33.838 --> 01:05:35.258
Dayton had to go to store

747
01:05:35.298 --> 01:05:38.383
to pick up something for me.

748
01:05:40.009 --> 01:05:42.804
Uh, Kathy, are you okay?

749
01:05:44.263 --> 01:05:47.725
Dayton had to go to store
to pick up something for me.


750
01:05:47.808 --> 01:05:52.185
So I guess...

751
01:05:52.268 --> 01:05:54.477
Uh, Kathy, why don't
you sit down?


752
01:05:54.561 --> 01:05:56.939
Okay.

753
01:05:59.066 --> 01:06:02.358
Can I, um...
can I get you a drink?


754
01:06:02.442 --> 01:06:04.485
Oh, no thank you.

755
01:06:04.568 --> 01:06:07.320
Dayton doesn't
like me to drink...


756
01:06:07.402 --> 01:06:09.321
alcohol.

757
01:06:12.948 --> 01:06:15.826
Must be heat
from the kitchen.


758
01:06:15.909 --> 01:06:18.078
I'm not used
to the heat.


759
01:06:19.578 --> 01:06:23.123
So, um, Kathy, how did you
and the professor meet?


760
01:06:23.207 --> 01:06:27.125
Oh, it's kind of funny,

761
01:06:27.167 --> 01:06:31.003
because I really
don't remember,


762
01:06:31.086 --> 01:06:33.923
I mean,
really how we meet.


763
01:06:34.006 --> 01:06:38.757
I only remember
just being with him.


764
01:06:38.799 --> 01:06:42.719
Oh, please, please don't tell
Dayton that I told you this.


765
01:06:42.801 --> 01:06:44.595
Because he tells everyone

766
01:06:44.636 --> 01:06:46.932
some romantic story
about how we met


767
01:06:46.973 --> 01:06:49.849
and he would be
really sad


768
01:06:49.933 --> 01:06:52.768
if I don't remember.

769
01:06:52.853 --> 01:06:56.104
Timer. I'll be right back
with more hors d'oeuvres.


770
01:06:56.188 --> 01:06:59.272
Okay.
What do you think?


771
01:06:59.357 --> 01:07:01.440
What's there to think?
She doesn't drink.


772
01:07:01.482 --> 01:07:03.024
Because liquids would
screw up her circuits.


773
01:07:03.107 --> 01:07:06.819
Exactly. Maybe he hasn't figured out
a way to shield them yet.


774
01:07:06.901 --> 01:07:08.862
Do you think she can eat?

775
01:07:08.945 --> 01:07:11.365
What do you
think she eats?


776
01:07:11.447 --> 01:07:13.823
I don't know.

777
01:07:15.618 --> 01:07:18.535
You really have
to try my paté


778
01:07:20.829 --> 01:07:23.331
So, Kathy,
are you having any?


779
01:07:23.414 --> 01:07:25.248
Me?

780
01:07:25.332 --> 01:07:27.792
No.

781
01:07:27.834 --> 01:07:30.543
Girl has to watch
their figure.


782
01:07:30.627 --> 01:07:34.047
And I won't be able
to fit my wedding gown.


783
01:07:34.130 --> 01:07:37.880
So, when did
you graduate?


784
01:07:37.965 --> 01:07:40.966
- About four years ago.
- The same.


785
01:07:41.049 --> 01:07:44.010
Dayton tells me
you're both engineers.


786
01:07:44.052 --> 01:07:45.805
Mmm-hmm.

787
01:07:45.846 --> 01:07:48.889
I'm engineer too.

788
01:07:48.973 --> 01:07:50.808
Oh, no kidding.

789
01:07:50.850 --> 01:07:53.725
I'll be right back.

790
01:07:57.312 --> 01:08:00.189
- Amazing.
- She's perfect.


791
01:08:00.272 --> 01:08:03.566
Did she just say engineer
or engineered?


792
01:08:03.650 --> 01:08:05.901
The professor,
he's a genius.


793
01:08:05.984 --> 01:08:09.571
Do you remember when the professor used
to play all those practical jokes on us?


794
01:08:09.653 --> 01:08:12.655
The exploding sandwich.

795
01:08:12.738 --> 01:08:16.659
Try the egg sandwiches.
They're delicious.


796
01:08:23.706 --> 01:08:26.081
You keep both hands
on the wheel.


797
01:08:26.164 --> 01:08:29.833
You young people nowadays
don't know how to drive.


798
01:08:54.933 --> 01:08:57.604
Maybe you should try the
bathroom before you go, John.


799
01:08:57.686 --> 01:09:00.605
Long drive ahead.

800
01:09:08.819 --> 01:09:11.278
It still hurts
sometimes, you know.


801
01:09:11.362 --> 01:09:12.946
It wasn't
a real snake, John.


802
01:09:13.029 --> 01:09:15.908
- It was robotics.
- Tell that to my leg.


803
01:09:15.991 --> 01:09:19.033
Of course.

804
01:09:19.075 --> 01:09:20.411
Do you think this
is one of them?


805
01:09:20.494 --> 01:09:23.079
It's gotta be.
Remember when we first got here


806
01:09:23.162 --> 01:09:25.872
and he said we were
"two of his smartest students"?


807
01:09:25.956 --> 01:09:28.624
He's probably somewhere
laughing at us right now.


808
01:09:28.706 --> 01:09:30.749
Don't you get it?
That's why he left us alone with her.


809
01:09:30.832 --> 01:09:32.752
He wants us to
figure out Kathy,


810
01:09:32.835 --> 01:09:34.628
his new and best
invention.


811
01:09:34.711 --> 01:09:36.461
Oh, he almost got us.

812
01:09:36.544 --> 01:09:39.339
What are we gonna do?

813
01:09:41.007 --> 01:09:43.050
Let's pull a prank on him.

814
01:09:43.092 --> 01:09:45.261
Let's find the switch
that'll turn her off.


815
01:09:45.344 --> 01:09:48.386
Hope you liked
my pierogis


816
01:09:48.471 --> 01:09:50.389
- Delicious,
- Yeah.


817
01:09:50.431 --> 01:09:51.972
Good.

818
01:09:52.057 --> 01:09:55.518
I'll be right back.
I'll make some more.


819
01:09:58.728 --> 01:10:00.604
Maybe we could
give you a hand.


820
01:10:23.869 --> 01:10:27.664
Look at this, the culture and design
is just absolute perfection.


821
01:10:27.748 --> 01:10:29.998
This blood is just so real.

822
01:10:35.752 --> 01:10:38.421
Oh my God. I haven't felt
any circuits yet though.


823
01:10:38.463 --> 01:10:40.256
Did you find the circuits?

824
01:10:40.339 --> 01:10:42.423
I think I found it.

825
01:10:45.093 --> 01:10:47.344
Oh my God,
look at this.


826
01:10:47.428 --> 01:10:49.680
The skin's so...

827
01:10:49.763 --> 01:10:51.973
It's perfect!
Perfect!


828
01:10:52.056 --> 01:10:54.263
Hey, Charles.

829
01:10:56.768 --> 01:10:58.685
Charles,
check out the brain.


830
01:11:01.938 --> 01:11:03.771
Look, it even
jiggles the right way.


831
01:11:03.855 --> 01:11:06.022
- Can I touch it?
- Yeah, go ahead.


832
01:11:07.442 --> 01:11:09.902
Oh, oh, oh.

833
01:11:09.985 --> 01:11:11.984
My God.

834
01:11:13.529 --> 01:11:16.448
The nerve endings...
pituitary gland in place.


835
01:11:16.489 --> 01:11:19.201
Everything, it's in here.
Oh, God.


836
01:11:21.950 --> 01:11:24.828
I gotta tell you, man,
this guy's a genius.


837
01:11:24.869 --> 01:11:26.704
This guy's a genius.

838
01:11:26.787 --> 01:11:28.914
The detail
is just impeccable.


839
01:11:28.997 --> 01:11:30.666
Never found
the right end.


840
01:11:36.503 --> 01:11:39.212
- Look at this.
- What?


841
01:11:43.133 --> 01:11:46.384
It's a scrapbook.

842
01:11:46.467 --> 01:11:49.471
I mean, look at this...
pictures and letters.


843
01:11:49.554 --> 01:11:51.345
With... with...

844
01:11:51.429 --> 01:11:54.681
I mean, it's like the detail he's gone
to make this woman real is just unreal.


845
01:11:54.765 --> 01:11:56.267
He's a genius.

846
01:11:56.351 --> 01:11:57.977
"My dearest Emmett. "

847
01:11:58.060 --> 01:12:01.020
"Dating for the Scientific
Community, New Editions. "


848
01:12:01.061 --> 01:12:03.896
"Katia is an engineer
in the University of Moscow.


849
01:12:03.978 --> 01:12:05.729
She specializes
in aeronautics.


850
01:12:05.814 --> 01:12:07.983
She's seeking a warm
and cuddly older gentleman


851
01:12:08.067 --> 01:12:09.982
- with a sense of humor. "
- We finally got him back.


852
01:12:10.024 --> 01:12:11.819
"Rocket scientists preferred.

853
01:12:11.860 --> 01:12:15.862
Must talk to Dr. Farwell
about global transience amnesia. "


854
01:12:21.699 --> 01:12:22.993
What?

855
01:12:24.410 --> 01:12:26.995
Mr. Melancholy,
it's not a big deal.


856
01:12:27.037 --> 01:12:29.663
We're gonna help him put her back
together before the wedding, okay?


857
01:12:29.747 --> 01:12:33.166
What?

858
01:12:33.208 --> 01:12:36.251
John, I think...

859
01:12:36.335 --> 01:12:39.169
What?
What is this?


860
01:12:39.211 --> 01:12:40.628
I think she...

861
01:12:44.049 --> 01:12:47.258
Mail-order bride.

862
01:12:49.844 --> 01:12:51.636
John, she's...

863
01:12:54.431 --> 01:12:57.683
She's... oh God.

864
01:12:57.726 --> 01:12:59.934
Oh my God, Charles.
What're we gonna do?


865
01:13:00.017 --> 01:13:01.978
Oh my God!

866
01:13:03.894 --> 01:13:06.731
Honey, I'm back!

867
01:13:07.856 --> 01:13:09.815
Sorry, guys,
but, uh...


868
01:13:11.776 --> 01:13:15.278
Kathy ordered this cake
and Kathy doesn't drive


869
01:13:15.361 --> 01:13:17.238
so I had to go pick it up.

870
01:13:28.369 --> 01:13:30.371
Kathy?
John?


871
01:13:30.456 --> 01:13:31.706
Charles?

872
01:13:33.790 --> 01:13:36.251
Kathy?

873
01:13:36.334 --> 01:13:38.542
John?

874
01:13:38.626 --> 01:13:40.754
Charles?

875
01:13:40.838 --> 01:13:43.965
Kathy?

876
01:13:44.048 --> 01:13:45.967
John?

877
01:13:46.049 --> 01:13:47.636
Charles?

878
01:13:57.140 --> 01:13:59.891
She sure knows
how to cook!


879
01:14:01.225 --> 01:14:03.977
Mmm-mmm-mmm.

880
01:14:07.147 --> 01:14:10.483
Oh bah!

881
01:14:18.739 --> 01:14:20.655
Hey, don't be pushing.

882
01:14:20.739 --> 01:14:22.825
You got a lot of nerve.
I'm a doctor, lady.


883
01:14:22.908 --> 01:14:24.367
Let me tell you,
your food sucks.


884
01:14:24.451 --> 01:14:26.576
I've seen fresher fish
in the LA river


885
01:14:26.659 --> 01:14:28.244
in a drought season!

886
01:14:28.285 --> 01:14:29.952
Okay okay, I'm sorry.
Come on, let's make up.


887
01:14:30.036 --> 01:14:31.538
No, no, no.
Me love you long time.


888
01:14:31.621 --> 01:14:33.831
Me so sorry.

889
01:14:36.374 --> 01:14:38.499
What?

890
01:14:38.584 --> 01:14:40.294
Hey, man.

891
01:14:40.379 --> 01:14:42.589
Can you help me out
with some spare change?


892
01:14:42.630 --> 01:14:44.840
No, man, I'm sorry. But listen, I'm
gonna think good thoughts for you.


893
01:14:44.923 --> 01:14:46.757
Whew! Good thoughts.
Good thoughts.


894
01:14:46.841 --> 01:14:48.634
Hey, just wait.
Be patient.


895
01:14:48.717 --> 01:14:50.842
How 'bout
something to eat?


896
01:14:50.925 --> 01:14:54.053
No, but good thoughts.
Really really good thoughts.


897
01:14:54.137 --> 01:14:56.096
Hold up!

898
01:14:59.140 --> 01:15:01.767
All right, all right.
Let me have a poodle just like his.


899
01:15:01.851 --> 01:15:03.267
One just like his.

900
01:15:03.309 --> 01:15:05.019
Come on, hand it over.

901
01:15:09.605 --> 01:15:11.275
Jeez, let's go.

902
01:15:25.491 --> 01:15:28.117
Spare change?

903
01:15:29.411 --> 01:15:32.121
Hey, here you
go, man.


904
01:15:32.163 --> 01:15:34.164
See?

905
01:15:34.247 --> 01:15:35.874
Thinking good
thoughts for you, huh?


906
01:15:45.839 --> 01:15:48.299
Excuse me, pardon me.

907
01:15:55.637 --> 01:15:57.263
Thank you.

908
01:16:18.237 --> 01:16:21.613
Somebody, please! We need a doctor!
We need a doctor!


909
01:16:21.697 --> 01:16:23.948
Hey, what's going on?

910
01:16:24.031 --> 01:16:26.657
Bad dog.

911
01:16:26.699 --> 01:16:28.158
Huh.

912
01:17:15.734 --> 01:17:17.151
You're late again.

913
01:17:17.234 --> 01:17:19.569
What? All the sick
people go home?


914
01:17:19.652 --> 01:17:22.029
I thought we spoke
about this.


915
01:17:22.113 --> 01:17:24.822
My sentence dictates
that I spend 30 days here. I'm here.


916
01:17:24.906 --> 01:17:26.700
So what do we got?

917
01:17:26.742 --> 01:17:29.743
This is not
a sentence, Doctor.


918
01:17:29.827 --> 01:17:32.496
It's an opportunity
to prove yourself,


919
01:17:32.579 --> 01:17:34.662
to help
the community.


920
01:17:34.746 --> 01:17:36.664
Do you want me
to call the judge


921
01:17:36.747 --> 01:17:38.666
and tell him your
heart's not in it?


922
01:17:38.749 --> 01:17:42.168
Anyone ever tell you you're beautiful
when you're a bitch?


923
01:17:42.251 --> 01:17:44.879
- No.
- Really?


924
01:17:44.962 --> 01:17:47.296
Seriously,
coffee...


925
01:17:47.380 --> 01:17:49.172
black.

926
01:17:49.256 --> 01:17:51.757
Mrs. Lexington is
ready to be seen.


927
01:17:51.840 --> 01:17:53.508
I'll bring her in.

928
01:18:27.282 --> 01:18:29.576
Go ahead
and sit down.


929
01:18:29.617 --> 01:18:32.328
Be careful,
there is a step.


930
01:18:34.578 --> 01:18:36.496
Very well.

931
01:18:39.499 --> 01:18:41.959
Let me get
this for you.


932
01:18:42.042 --> 01:18:44.627
You can give
me this too.


933
01:18:44.710 --> 01:18:46.837
Mrs. Lexington has
been having some difficulty...


934
01:18:46.920 --> 01:18:48.922
With her vision.
Mmm.


935
01:18:49.006 --> 01:18:52.382
Yes, how did
you know?


936
01:18:52.465 --> 01:18:53.926
Lucky guess.

937
01:18:53.967 --> 01:18:55.594
I'm over here,
darling.


938
01:18:55.678 --> 01:18:57.262
Mmm.

939
01:18:57.344 --> 01:19:00.012
Okay, Mrs. Lexington.

940
01:19:00.095 --> 01:19:02.015
Oh please, Doctor,

941
01:19:02.098 --> 01:19:04.764
call me Grams.
Everybody does.


942
01:19:04.806 --> 01:19:07.602
Okay, Grams.

943
01:19:07.685 --> 01:19:11.520
Well, your eyes are shot.
You're 74 years old.


944
01:19:11.604 --> 01:19:14.188
You've been battling
glaucoma for the last 10.


945
01:19:14.272 --> 01:19:17.233
And you're past
the point of safe surgical correction.


946
01:19:17.317 --> 01:19:20.068
Anything else I can
do for you while you are here?


947
01:19:22.111 --> 01:19:25.029
Are you sure?

948
01:19:28.030 --> 01:19:30.241
I'm sure.

949
01:19:31.492 --> 01:19:33.994
What... what would
you recommend?


950
01:19:34.036 --> 01:19:36.788
A seeing-eye dog?

951
01:19:36.871 --> 01:19:39.872
Doctor,
please.


952
01:19:39.957 --> 01:19:42.791
Come, Grams,
I'll get you a cab.


953
01:19:43.835 --> 01:19:46.169
Oh, if there's
any movies that


954
01:19:46.252 --> 01:19:49.297
you want to see,
don't wait.


955
01:19:52.172 --> 01:19:55.051
Oh, God.

956
01:19:55.135 --> 01:19:57.593
Another one down.

957
01:20:09.227 --> 01:20:12.187
Okay, let's see here.

958
01:20:12.228 --> 01:20:13.688
Yep, all right.

959
01:20:13.730 --> 01:20:15.981
What you need is

960
01:20:16.023 --> 01:20:19.235
a three-week prescription of
legal marijuana.


961
01:20:19.318 --> 01:20:21.276
There you go.
Next.


962
01:20:23.862 --> 01:20:26.238
Take two of these

963
01:20:26.321 --> 01:20:28.238
three times a day.

964
01:20:28.321 --> 01:20:30.241
When you're done,

965
01:20:30.324 --> 01:20:32.243
call the emergency room.

966
01:20:32.326 --> 01:20:33.868
Next.

967
01:20:45.876 --> 01:20:47.711
Hi. What seems
to be the problem?


968
01:20:47.794 --> 01:20:50.420
I don't know.
It seems like


969
01:20:50.504 --> 01:20:52.213
everything's just
not going right.


970
01:20:52.296 --> 01:20:54.175
Freight elevator

971
01:20:54.258 --> 01:20:56.217
crushed my wrist.

972
01:20:57.926 --> 01:20:59.885
Don't you need me to
take off my clothes?


973
01:20:59.927 --> 01:21:02.053
Next.

974
01:21:06.017 --> 01:21:08.892
Ming...
Ming Yee?


975
01:21:08.977 --> 01:21:10.769
Is that Chink or Jap?

976
01:21:12.395 --> 01:21:14.104
There you go.

977
01:21:14.188 --> 01:21:15.854
Next.

978
01:21:15.937 --> 01:21:19.108
You are funny today.
That's good. That's good.


979
01:21:19.191 --> 01:21:22.483
We'll see how funny you are when I
break your arm again and reset it.


980
01:21:22.567 --> 01:21:23.694
Next.

981
01:21:32.490 --> 01:21:35.453
Got the ol'
black eye there, huh?


982
01:21:35.536 --> 01:21:36.662
How did you get that?

983
01:21:36.745 --> 01:21:40.414
Ming Yee.

984
01:21:40.497 --> 01:21:42.875
Okay, here's what
it's going to be.


985
01:21:42.958 --> 01:21:44.584
That be five dollar.

986
01:21:50.795 --> 01:21:51.920
Thanks, man.

987
01:21:52.003 --> 01:21:54.506
18mg of Viagra.

988
01:21:54.589 --> 01:21:55.549
Merry Christmas.

989
01:21:59.009 --> 01:22:02.220
Five doll...

990
01:22:03.720 --> 01:22:05.181
Next.

991
01:22:11.519 --> 01:22:13.686
Okay, what seems
to be the problem?


992
01:22:15.146 --> 01:22:17.940
Sorry, hold on a second.

993
01:22:18.023 --> 01:22:20.356
No, no, I'm listening.
Go ahead.


994
01:22:21.775 --> 01:22:24.319
Nurse Jacobs,

995
01:22:24.402 --> 01:22:26.527
I can't write
a prescription for ugly.


996
01:22:27.694 --> 01:22:29.989
Take this prescription.
Go down to the pharmacy.


997
01:22:30.072 --> 01:22:32.448
Uh-huh. Yeah.

998
01:22:35.452 --> 01:22:37.243
I'm sorry, what did you
say the problem was?


999
01:22:37.327 --> 01:22:40.287
Have him bring
two bottles of wine.


1000
01:22:40.329 --> 01:22:42.581
The two of you
take the entire bottle.


1001
01:22:42.665 --> 01:22:45.374
Drink all the wine.

1002
01:22:45.458 --> 01:22:47.751
I guarantee you'll
never see me again.


1003
01:22:50.335 --> 01:22:51.961
Next.

1004
01:23:01.093 --> 01:23:03.719
Do you find
medicine stressful?


1005
01:23:03.802 --> 01:23:05.181
Sure.

1006
01:23:05.265 --> 01:23:07.598
You see, now's
the time we get to unwind.


1007
01:23:07.640 --> 01:23:10.391
There's a party tonight.
Do you want to come?


1008
01:23:10.475 --> 01:23:12.059
It's a kind of
a get-together.


1009
01:23:12.142 --> 01:23:14.769
It's ladies' night.

1010
01:23:14.811 --> 01:23:16.102
Maybe next time.

1011
01:23:16.186 --> 01:23:18.480
Hold you too that.
Hmm.


1012
01:23:18.563 --> 01:23:20.481
See you tomorrow...
on time.


1013
01:23:20.564 --> 01:23:23.358
On time.

1014
01:24:05.679 --> 01:24:08.140
Stop.
See anything you like?


1015
01:24:08.222 --> 01:24:11.683
No, sorry, I'm into
midgets right now.


1016
01:24:11.724 --> 01:24:13.600
Hey!

1017
01:24:13.684 --> 01:24:15.810
Aren't you the new doctor
in the clinic?


1018
01:24:15.894 --> 01:24:18.479
For you?
No, no, no.


1019
01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:21.439
Say, I...

1020
01:24:21.524 --> 01:24:23.858
I'm having real
bad pains in my chest.


1021
01:24:23.942 --> 01:24:25.651
Oh, Is that right?
Well, I'll you what,


1022
01:24:25.734 --> 01:24:27.609
I'm going in here and
I'm going to get laid.


1023
01:24:27.693 --> 01:24:29.195
Then I'll come back.

1024
01:24:29.278 --> 01:24:31.446
Meet me down at
the hospital and I'll give you


1025
01:24:31.530 --> 01:24:33.783
a bowel movement you
will never forget, okay?


1026
01:24:33.866 --> 01:24:36.701
Yah!
Whoo.


1027
01:24:38.200 --> 01:24:40.328
Asshole!

1028
01:24:41.996 --> 01:24:44.288
- Psst. Psst.
- Professor.


1029
01:24:44.372 --> 01:24:46.665
- Shh.
- What's up?


1030
01:24:46.749 --> 01:24:48.958
Say, those radios

1031
01:24:49.041 --> 01:24:51.710
you traded me
were a hit.


1032
01:24:51.793 --> 01:24:53.378
Do you have some?

1033
01:24:53.462 --> 01:24:54.962
I've already sold
one of them.


1034
01:24:55.046 --> 01:24:56.671
Do you have some
more for me?


1035
01:24:56.712 --> 01:25:00.341
Actually, I need
something from you.


1036
01:25:00.424 --> 01:25:01.591
What do you need?

1037
01:25:01.674 --> 01:25:04.844
Do you still have
that voodoo kit?


1038
01:25:04.886 --> 01:25:06.678
I have the voodoo kit.

1039
01:25:06.720 --> 01:25:08.847
The beginners' or
the advanced?


1040
01:25:08.931 --> 01:25:11.140
The very advanced.

1041
01:25:11.223 --> 01:25:13.140
Very advanced?
Then, Professor,


1042
01:25:13.223 --> 01:25:16.811
you're going to need
the chicken too.


1043
01:25:16.895 --> 01:25:19.145
That's what
you need.


1044
01:25:19.228 --> 01:25:22.190
- Yah!
- Okay, okay, I'll take the chicken.


1045
01:25:22.232 --> 01:25:25.441
You'll take
it, okay. Yah.


1046
01:25:35.990 --> 01:25:37.908
Hey, back so soon?

1047
01:25:37.991 --> 01:25:40.535
Absolutely.

1048
01:25:40.618 --> 01:25:42.579
What did you
bring me?


1049
01:25:42.620 --> 01:25:44.581
Ah...

1050
01:25:44.664 --> 01:25:46.040
You know the rules.

1051
01:25:46.123 --> 01:25:47.499
Gotta have new faces.

1052
01:25:47.582 --> 01:25:49.499
This doesn't work
without new faces.


1053
01:25:49.583 --> 01:25:53.378
I brought party
favors this time.


1054
01:25:55.504 --> 01:25:57.672
Okay.

1055
01:26:07.845 --> 01:26:10.847
Rachael.

1056
01:26:16.185 --> 01:26:18.436
Hey-ey-ey
everybody.


1057
01:26:18.520 --> 01:26:20.271
Ooh-ooh-ooh.

1058
01:26:20.354 --> 01:26:23.398
Mmm-mmm-mmm.
Thank you.


1059
01:26:23.481 --> 01:26:25.440
Mmm. You are
so welcome.


1060
01:26:25.481 --> 01:26:28.400
Sandra, my love.

1061
01:26:28.442 --> 01:26:30.401
Gorgeous, darling.

1062
01:26:30.443 --> 01:26:32.446
Ooh. Whoo.

1063
01:26:32.488 --> 01:26:35.238
Oh, look at you.
I do know you.


1064
01:26:36.947 --> 01:26:39.158
- Dr. Farwell,
- Dino, Dino, Dino.


1065
01:26:39.242 --> 01:26:41.660
How are you?
For your lovely lady there.


1066
01:26:41.743 --> 01:26:43.078
Hey, would you like
anything special?


1067
01:26:43.120 --> 01:26:44.913
Take 'em, take' em,
pass the them around.


1068
01:26:44.997 --> 01:26:46.830
- Make friends?
- You will make so many friends.


1069
01:26:48.539 --> 01:26:50.875
Hey, hey, hey.
I know you.


1070
01:26:50.957 --> 01:26:52.875
I know you.
Aren't you...


1071
01:26:52.959 --> 01:26:55.419
Hold on. It's going to come to me.
It's going to come to me.


1072
01:26:55.461 --> 01:26:59.630
Ah, ooh, lovely, lovely.
I will catch you...


1073
01:26:59.713 --> 01:27:02.507
Ooh, my, my, my.

1074
01:27:02.591 --> 01:27:05.052
My, my, you
look so good.


1075
01:27:05.135 --> 01:27:07.345
Everybody looking
good today.


1076
01:27:07.428 --> 01:27:09.180
Hi.

1077
01:27:09.263 --> 01:27:12.055
Mmm-hmm.
How are you?


1078
01:27:12.139 --> 01:27:13.599
You are nice.

1079
01:27:13.681 --> 01:27:15.474
Let's go.
Let's go.


1080
01:27:17.727 --> 01:27:20.228
Mmm-hmm.
Hello, honey.


1081
01:29:10.804 --> 01:29:12.638
Ladies and gentlemen,

1082
01:29:12.720 --> 01:29:14.680
let the real
party begin.


1083
01:29:22.893 --> 01:29:25.229
Where have you been?

1084
01:29:25.313 --> 01:29:28.357
Do you realize
what time it is?


1085
01:29:30.026 --> 01:29:32.694
Have you been out
all night?


1086
01:29:32.778 --> 01:29:35.862
No, I always wear the same clothes
for days at a time.


1087
01:29:35.904 --> 01:29:37.697
Phew!

1088
01:29:37.780 --> 01:29:39.865
Have you even slept?

1089
01:29:39.949 --> 01:29:42.367
Does it matter?

1090
01:29:42.450 --> 01:29:44.618
What have we got?

1091
01:29:44.701 --> 01:29:46.701
What have we got?

1092
01:30:12.469 --> 01:30:15.846
Um, I've got like
a little bit of


1093
01:30:15.929 --> 01:30:17.849
a pain right here in
that part of my wrist.


1094
01:30:17.932 --> 01:30:20.434
Okay, if you'll just take off your
clothes, we'll take a look at it.


1095
01:30:24.020 --> 01:30:25.936
So I'm working my door
at the club, right?


1096
01:30:26.020 --> 01:30:27.814
And this big huge guy
just comes right up to me.


1097
01:30:27.897 --> 01:30:29.316
He's like,
"Oh, I'm with Jim. "


1098
01:30:29.399 --> 01:30:30.901
I was like, "Who
the hell is Jim, man?"


1099
01:30:30.983 --> 01:30:32.818
So, Doctor, I have
this rash.


1100
01:30:32.901 --> 01:30:35.193
I'm sorry, if you'll take all
of your clothes...


1101
01:30:35.277 --> 01:30:37.404
hey, you know, why
don't you just bend over the table?


1102
01:30:37.487 --> 01:30:39.905
Take off your clothes and bend over
the table. We'll take a quick look.


1103
01:30:39.947 --> 01:30:41.699
But it's just right here.

1104
01:30:41.782 --> 01:30:44.200
You know, it's probably a symptom
of a deeper problem.


1105
01:30:44.283 --> 01:30:46.200
Let me grab my probe.
We'll take a quick look.


1106
01:30:46.284 --> 01:30:47.994
But what could I do
at the club?


1107
01:30:49.495 --> 01:30:52.164
I got it like two weeks
ago and it's really itchy and pussy.


1108
01:30:52.247 --> 01:30:53.541
Here you go.

1109
01:30:56.458 --> 01:30:58.834
Is there a girl
doctor who could...


1110
01:30:58.917 --> 01:31:00.794
No, honey, I'm the only
doctor in this town.


1111
01:31:02.337 --> 01:31:04.714
- I don't really want to do this.
- Oh.


1112
01:31:08.175 --> 01:31:11.386
"1-875
-BIG
-GIRLS, wow. "

1113
01:31:11.468 --> 01:31:13.511
- Are you fucking joking?
- That's...


1114
01:31:13.594 --> 01:31:16.056
- Are you fucking serious?
... for Hollywood girls, big and bold.


1115
01:31:16.139 --> 01:31:19.140
What kind of fucking doctor are you?
Are you kidding me?


1116
01:31:19.182 --> 01:31:22.142
Here's your prescription.
Next.


1117
01:31:25.603 --> 01:31:28.648
- Is that your phone number?
- Mmm-hmm.


1118
01:31:35.151 --> 01:31:37.152
Mr. Rhodes,

1119
01:31:37.194 --> 01:31:39.238
this is Dr. Farwell.

1120
01:31:39.320 --> 01:31:42.574
He's our attending physician
for the next month.


1121
01:31:42.657 --> 01:31:46.032
He is here for a follow-up
on his daughter Dusty.


1122
01:31:48.910 --> 01:31:50.286
Dusty?

1123
01:31:50.370 --> 01:31:53.290
We thought she was
going to be a boy.


1124
01:31:53.331 --> 01:31:56.374
Thank you, Doctor,
for seeing us.


1125
01:31:56.457 --> 01:31:58.917
We haven't been able to see
a specialist yet.


1126
01:31:59.001 --> 01:32:00.961
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hang loose.


1127
01:32:01.045 --> 01:32:04.589
Okay, and a few
weeks ago...


1128
01:32:04.672 --> 01:32:06.631
blood test...

1129
01:32:06.672 --> 01:32:08.923
white blood count...
yada yada yada.


1130
01:32:16.181 --> 01:32:17.514
Oh, yeah,
there it is.


1131
01:32:17.598 --> 01:32:19.805
What is it, Doctor?

1132
01:32:21.891 --> 01:32:23.768
You been having
headaches, Dusty?


1133
01:32:23.851 --> 01:32:25.726
Sort of come and go
real quick?


1134
01:32:26.769 --> 01:32:28.397
Yes.

1135
01:32:28.480 --> 01:32:31.106
It's cause you
have a brain tumor.


1136
01:32:33.024 --> 01:32:34.942
Tumor? Is it...

1137
01:32:35.025 --> 01:32:37.069
is it cancer?

1138
01:32:37.153 --> 01:32:39.071
Inoperable cancer.

1139
01:32:44.115 --> 01:32:46.908
Okay, so there's
a tumor.


1140
01:32:46.991 --> 01:32:49.618
We understand.

1141
01:32:55.080 --> 01:32:56.997
Doctor?

1142
01:32:58.084 --> 01:32:59.710
Doctor,

1143
01:32:59.792 --> 01:33:02.293
what is our next step?

1144
01:33:02.377 --> 01:33:04.671
Um...

1145
01:33:08.715 --> 01:33:11.010
have you attended
your senior prom?


1146
01:33:11.092 --> 01:33:12.760
No, I'm a junior.

1147
01:33:12.842 --> 01:33:16.429
I'd find one to take her
to this weekend.


1148
01:33:18.888 --> 01:33:20.847
Can I get some
coffee?


1149
01:33:23.224 --> 01:33:26.142
What's wrong with you,
you jackass?


1150
01:33:26.225 --> 01:33:30.022
Could I get some
coffee, por favor?


1151
01:33:30.064 --> 01:33:32.773
You cannot just tell
a 15-year-old girl


1152
01:33:32.857 --> 01:33:34.817
that she's gonna die,
no questions asked.


1153
01:33:34.900 --> 01:33:37.525
Oh, come on,
the kid's a goner.


1154
01:33:37.609 --> 01:33:39.320
You don't want to sit
here and talk about it


1155
01:33:39.403 --> 01:33:41.154
for the next whatever,
do you, sweetie?


1156
01:33:46.366 --> 01:33:48.908
I'm getting some coffee.

1157
01:33:54.413 --> 01:33:56.412
Oh my gosh.

1158
01:34:15.428 --> 01:34:17.344
I'm back!

1159
01:34:17.429 --> 01:34:19.263
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo.

1160
01:34:19.346 --> 01:34:22.723
That's right,
for you and you and you.


1161
01:34:22.807 --> 01:34:25.142
Whoo!
Let's party.


1162
01:34:25.224 --> 01:34:27.562
Breaking news just in.
Authorities believe that


1163
01:34:27.604 --> 01:34:29.313
the latest rash of
serial murders


1164
01:34:29.397 --> 01:34:30.980
has been committed
by a woman.


1165
01:34:31.064 --> 01:34:32.940
They believe she
may be a prostitute


1166
01:34:33.023 --> 01:34:36.524
and the local cowboys have dubbed
the culprit, "The Call-Girl Killer. "


1167
01:34:36.607 --> 01:34:40.028
She has claimed 10 victims
so far, all male.


1168
01:34:44.780 --> 01:34:46.739
Excuse me, excuse me.
Who are you?


1169
01:34:46.781 --> 01:34:48.490
Security.

1170
01:34:48.573 --> 01:34:50.158
Where's the regular?

1171
01:34:50.241 --> 01:34:52.161
The short guy?

1172
01:34:52.244 --> 01:34:54.536
Dirty looking,
on the slow side.


1173
01:34:54.620 --> 01:34:56.665
- Jerry.
- Yeah, Jerry.


1174
01:34:58.165 --> 01:35:00.458
- He didn't show up for work.
- It figures.


1175
01:35:00.542 --> 01:35:03.044
All right. I need you to
stay here tonight.


1176
01:35:03.128 --> 01:35:05.045
There's a psychotic
homeless guy stalking me.


1177
01:35:09.589 --> 01:35:12.423
Sure.

1178
01:35:12.507 --> 01:35:14.468
Good.

1179
01:35:27.977 --> 01:35:29.937
Fuck this.

1180
01:37:07.628 --> 01:37:10.337
Wait!

1181
01:37:44.695 --> 01:37:46.862
Good...

1182
01:37:46.945 --> 01:37:49.282
hot dog.

1183
01:37:52.825 --> 01:37:54.785
Thank you.

1184
01:38:21.177 --> 01:38:22.677
Hey, hot-dog man!

1185
01:38:22.761 --> 01:38:24.389
Hey, could I get two
of those to go?


1186
01:38:24.430 --> 01:38:27.098
$2.

1187
01:38:27.182 --> 01:38:28.682
Two?

1188
01:38:30.934 --> 01:38:33.518
- Here you go, buddy.
- You got two?


1189
01:38:36.480 --> 01:38:40.399
Those things will
kill you! Yah!


1190
01:39:20.050 --> 01:39:22.718
She's such a kidder.

1191
01:39:55.367 --> 01:39:58.161
Alice. Alice.
Hey.


1192
01:40:07.875 --> 01:40:11.419
Alice is going to look so beautiful
on her wedding day.


1193
01:40:15.588 --> 01:40:17.591
Yeah.

1194
01:40:19.840 --> 01:40:22.636
So, how is
Carol, anyway?


1195
01:40:22.678 --> 01:40:26.388
She's not well.
She's not well at all, Father.


1196
01:40:26.472 --> 01:40:29.932
She's still convinced
we have a daughter named Alice.


1197
01:40:30.017 --> 01:40:31.851
- Alice?
- Alice, yeah.


1198
01:40:31.934 --> 01:40:33.976
I'm so worried
about her, Father.


1199
01:40:34.059 --> 01:40:35.893
What can you
do to help us?


1200
01:40:35.978 --> 01:40:37.813
Have you been saying your
Hail Marys?


1201
01:40:37.855 --> 01:40:39.522
- Yes.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.


1202
01:40:39.605 --> 01:40:41.648
Then add a couple
of Our Fathers.


1203
01:40:41.732 --> 01:40:44.815
Oh. Yes.

1204
01:40:44.900 --> 01:40:46.360
Mmm-hmm.

1205
01:41:07.082 --> 01:41:10.501
It's all about
the future now.
