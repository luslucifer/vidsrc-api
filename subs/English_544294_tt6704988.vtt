Man: I was up a
couple of weeks ago


3
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.170
and the whole area
was flooded.


4
00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.310
Couldn't even get in
past the gate.


5

You gotta be careful of the
weather up this way. Yeah.


6
00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:58.680
About a week ago,

7
00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.350
just north of here? Snow.

8
00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.020
Everything covered
for four days.


9
00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.850
And then it flooded down here.

10
00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.860
So, like that, we'd have to
bring the truck in.

But I'm not supposed to be
doing that on my own.

But, if I get stuck in here, now
with the truck or the ATV?

00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:04.490
I'm dead.

166
00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:10.190
-So what's wrong with
my idea then?


167
00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:12.100
-What's wrong with your idea?

168
00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:14.160
-Oh, does it go
against your ethical code?


169
00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:18.600
It goes against my ethical code.

170
00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:19.900
-I've seen your movies, man.

171
00:11:21.370 --> 00:11:22.810
You don't have an ethical code.

172
00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:25.860
Plus, with my idea,

173
00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:28.080
you don't have to waste money
on make-up and effects.


174
00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:38.890
-What about...

175
00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:44.630
What about crew, cameras,
and all that?


176
00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:47.960
-Jesus Patrick, I gotta come up
with all the answers for you?

It's so great to see

in which we celebrate celebrity.

We will be performing a live,
in-studio autopsy

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:41.920
of a really famous celebrity.

He is an internet star.

A rapper.

195
00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:46.990
And an international movie star.

196
00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:49.730
He is "The Killa".

197
00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:51.660
The rise from internet star

198
00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:54.600
to star of the silver screen
came quickly for The Killa.


199
00:12:57.340 --> 00:12:58.630
All that you've done for me.

200
00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.740
You changed my life, truly.

201
00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:05.480
This means so much more
to me this time.


202
00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:08.180
I don't know why.

203
00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:11.210
I think the first time
I hardly felt it.


204
00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:13.220
Because it was so new.

205
00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:20.260
I owe a lot to my players...

206
00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:22.830
To the cast.

207
00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:27.200
To Lindsay and John and Danny.

00:13:27.770 --> 00:13:29.770
And Ed, and Amy.

209
00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:34.040
And my little friends Jamie
and Yankton.


210
00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:38.410
I owe a lot to my family.

211
00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:40.510
For holding me together.

212
00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:42.400
And loving me.

213
00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:44.280
And having patience in
this obsession of mine.


214
00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:51.090
But I want to say
thank you to you.


215
00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:54.520
I haven't had an
orthodox career.

And I've wanted more than
anything to have your respect.

The first time I didn't feel it.

But this time, I feel it.

that you like me.

-Then I'll have to
be resourceful.

232

There was a closing party
for some play.


233
00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:45.680
Nothing was free, obviously.
It was theatre.

But there were some
people there.

starting soon.

for a few weeks back?

Why are you acting like this?

258
00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:51.240
Because I'm an actor.

Seriously, though. What studio?

There is no studio.
It's not like that.

I bet you won't know any
of the actors in there.

Why is that?

281
00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:40.590

About an hour or so before you.

Hi.

360
00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:36.970
Hi Grace.

361
00:23:36.970 --> 00:23:38.970
Let's get you a mask.

362
00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:41.610
Ok.

363
00:23:41.610 --> 00:23:43.140
These were just in the house
when we got here.


364
00:23:43.150 --> 00:23:46.350
I think it'll be fun if we dress
up and get to know each other.


365
00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:49.180
Don't you find when you wear a
mask you can be more open?


366
00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:51.150
Like on Halloween, how
you go out dressed up.


367
00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:52.420
And you can be more yourself.

368
00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:54.590
Or maybe you can be
who you're dressed up as.


369
00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:56.260
Obviously you recognize
where these masks came from.


370
00:23:56.260 --> 00:23:58.010
No, I don't.

371
00:23:58.010 --> 00:23:59.760
Oh, somebody wasn't paying
attention in acting school.


372
00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:02.700
I didn't go to acting school.

373
00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:04.530
And you still got a
part in a movie?


374
00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:05.530
That's so cool.

375
00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:06.470
Thanks.

376
00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:08.470
I've always
wanted to be an actress.


377
00:24:08.810 --> 00:24:09.710
Actor.

378
00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:11.970
Women are called actors now,
just like the men.


379
00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:13.510
But you didn't go
to acting school.


380
00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:15.080
So you probably
wouldn't know that.


381
00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:16.310
So don't worry about.

382
00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:20.480
Ahhh, that's the chorus mask.

383
00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:22.650
In Greek plays the chorus
represented


384
00:24:22.650 --> 00:24:25.190
the morality of the actions of
the characters in the play.


385
00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:27.190
They sort of spoke
for the audience.

This must be pretty
foreign for you.

In acting class, we'd
always have courses on

what to expect when
you're on set, like a rhyme.

An actor's job

00:26:56.410 --> 00:26:58.370
is to enter the lives of people

they did back in the 'fifties-

everyone in Germany

push the button.

And when he did,

610

he'd hear someone cry out
in agony in another room.

And then the doctor would tell
him to push the button again.

And the experiment
was to figure out


613

if he'd push the button

614

someone he didn't know, pain.

01:02:33.140 --> 01:02:35.540
My first callback was
for an erotic role.


824
01:02:38.810 --> 01:02:42.150
I thought that maybe it meant
I had to kiss someone.


825
01:02:45.650 --> 01:02:46.720
Forty five minutes later

826
01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:49.060
I find myself in a room
full of older men


827
01:02:49.060 --> 01:02:50.760
with my boobs hanging out.

828
01:02:54.900 --> 01:02:59.000
It was for a horror movie,
actually.


829
01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:00.900
Didn't even get to
die on screen.


830
01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:03.900
They just found my body, naked.

Tits and blood everywhere.

832
01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:08.910
I got paid what the call
an honorarium.

01:03:10.850 --> 01:03:15.250

done that instead.

I heard about this porn star
once named Alex Jordan.

01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:26.430
She fucked on screen
for a few years.


837
01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:29.700
And then she tried to
live a normal life.


838
01:03:29.700 --> 01:03:32.030
And she got a ski
shop in Colorado.

and loving every minute of it.
