1
00:00:34.068 --> 00:00:35.603
You don't have to hold just on me,

2
00:00:35.604 --> 00:00:37.071
you know.
I'm not even in character.


3
00:00:37.072 --> 00:00:39.473
Just catch the atmosphere,
get the feeling.


4
00:00:39.474 --> 00:00:42.343
Feel the place. God, Mary.

5
00:00:42.344 --> 00:00:44.345
Get that tree, that's good.

6
00:00:44.346 --> 00:00:46.147
That?
Yeah, just get the tree.


7
00:00:46.148 --> 00:00:47.348
Why?
You got it?


8
00:00:47.349 --> 00:00:48.983
Because we have to film everything.

9
00:00:48.984 --> 00:00:51.551
I need atmosphere, all right?
I gotta get the setting.


10
00:00:52.086 --> 00:00:53.553
It's a desert.

11
00:00:54.555 --> 00:00:56.222
For God's sake.

12
00:00:57.024 --> 00:00:58.758
Feels hot.

13
00:01:00.962 --> 00:01:02.295
Wait until you see it.

14
00:01:03.431 --> 00:01:06.699
You are going to be amazed.

15
00:01:09.637 --> 00:01:13.506
<i>♪ We're gonna have a little party</i>

16
00:01:15.209 --> 00:01:19.279
<i>♪ And we got some
special people comin' ♪</i>


17
00:01:20.948 --> 00:01:23.349
Ready? Behold the gates.

18
00:01:24.952 --> 00:01:27.889
Oh, my God, it's a dump.

19
00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.224
What the hell are
you talkin' about?


20
00:01:30.225 --> 00:01:32.426
It's a hell of a lot
better than last time.


21
00:01:32.427 --> 00:01:34.867
Look, it's isolated, we got room
for everybody, it is perfect.


22
00:01:37.565 --> 00:01:38.765
Welcome home.

23
00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:48.875
Mary?

24
00:01:50.611 --> 00:01:51.878
Mary?

25
00:02:40.128 --> 00:02:41.888
<i>What did we do wrong last time?</i>

26
00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.569
If you'll recall,

27
00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.438
somebody got a little
antsy and lost control.


28
00:03:00.147 --> 00:03:01.314
So this time

29
00:03:02.583 --> 00:03:04.717
let's streamline the plot.

30
00:03:11.292 --> 00:03:13.193
No fuckin' around,

31
00:03:14.195 --> 00:03:16.597
no losing control.

32
00:03:16.598 --> 00:03:18.531
Let's keep it simple.

33
00:03:20.701 --> 00:03:22.435
Nobody gets antsy

34
00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.510
and nobody gets away.

35
00:03:38.152 --> 00:03:39.387
<i>Here, one box,
then we'll be ready to start.</i>


36
00:03:39.388 --> 00:03:40.887
Okay, get the camera ready.

37
00:03:44.392 --> 00:03:46.327
All right.

38
00:03:46.328 --> 00:03:50.097
Okay, you ready?
All right, frame me up. Okay.


39
00:03:50.098 --> 00:03:53.534
So, this is our church set.

40
00:03:53.535 --> 00:03:55.669
Crude, but simplistic.

41
00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.338
I've always been an admirer
of the Spartan approach.


42
00:03:58.773 --> 00:04:02.643
Clothes make the man.

43
00:04:02.644 --> 00:04:05.179
No seams on the sides,
bigger shoulder line.


44
00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.348
Short sleeves make
me look taller, right?


45
00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:09.817
Nice? Beautiful? Yeah.

46
00:04:09.818 --> 00:04:11.752
Uh...

47
00:04:11.753 --> 00:04:15.723
A few quasi-religious props.

48
00:04:15.724 --> 00:04:19.794
You need a central focus.
Pull their eyes here.


49
00:04:19.795 --> 00:04:22.596
Humans are so easily distracted.

50
00:04:22.597 --> 00:04:24.165
Keep your eye on the birdie,
right?


51
00:04:29.137 --> 00:04:30.738
Didn't see that comin', did you?

52
00:04:30.739 --> 00:04:32.273
You can't just
dress like Superman


53
00:04:32.274 --> 00:04:34.075
and expect to
fuckin' fly, can you, huh?


54
00:04:34.076 --> 00:04:37.745
No, you can't.
You must have movement,
dynamic movement.


55
00:04:37.746 --> 00:04:40.480
Spread your arms wide. Kneel.

56
00:04:41.115 --> 00:04:42.783
Eyes straight ahead.

57
00:04:42.784 --> 00:04:46.787
Dynamic finger movement,
always slightly curled.
You see?


58
00:04:46.788 --> 00:04:50.758
The voice that I'm using right
now is clearly designed


59
00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:55.196
to make you, against all of
your better judgment like me.


60
00:04:55.197 --> 00:04:59.999
But you drop down the tone,
just ever so slightly.


61
00:05:01.135 --> 00:05:03.337
We face you.

62
00:05:03.338 --> 00:05:07.541
We speak to you with a
slightly halting cadence.


63
00:05:07.542 --> 00:05:10.478
Questioning, searching eyes.

64
00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:14.814
A quietly discomforting, although
caring, effect can be achieved.


65
00:05:15.816 --> 00:05:17.685
Do you see?

66
00:05:17.686 --> 00:05:23.390
Well then we get deep down in
fuck-you-in-the-ass territory.


67
00:05:23.391 --> 00:05:25.692
And that's a place
I like to be, baby.


68
00:05:26.861 --> 00:05:28.528
So here it is.

69
00:05:29.296 --> 00:05:31.898
This is our playroom.

70
00:05:34.535 --> 00:05:35.668
Let's play.

71
00:05:40.841 --> 00:05:42.542
Looks like I'm
heading to Mexico.


72
00:05:46.213 --> 00:05:47.814
I wanna share
something with you.


73
00:05:50.217 --> 00:05:53.953
This is the last thing I got from
my sister before she disappeared.


74
00:05:57.491 --> 00:05:59.426
"Dear El,

75
00:05:59.427 --> 00:06:02.229
"I wish you could
be here with me.


76
00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:05.666
"Every day is
a perfect experience.


77
00:06:05.667 --> 00:06:09.068
"Father Simon has shown me what
a beautiful person I really am.


78
00:06:11.305 --> 00:06:14.875
"I know you won't understand
this, but it's what I needed.


79
00:06:14.876 --> 00:06:16.943
"I feel like I am finally home.

80
00:06:18.312 --> 00:06:19.679
"Love, Janet."

81
00:06:21.849 --> 00:06:23.716
That is not my sister.

82
00:06:28.656 --> 00:06:33.561
I'm now about 200 Ks
south of the U.S. border.


83
00:06:33.562 --> 00:06:35.762
They said they'd
meet me here at noon.


84
00:06:40.234 --> 00:06:41.501
Hey.

85
00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:43.936
Are you Ellen?

86
00:06:44.505 --> 00:06:45.571
Yeah.

87
00:06:45.839 --> 00:06:47.106
I'm Mary.

88
00:06:47.942 --> 00:06:49.409
Hop in.

89
00:06:50.477 --> 00:06:51.545
Guys, this is Ellen.

90
00:06:51.546 --> 00:06:52.813
Hey.

91
00:06:52.814 --> 00:06:54.414
Hey.
Hi.


92
00:06:55.216 --> 00:06:56.482
Hey.

93
00:06:57.618 --> 00:06:59.619
It's hot out there.

94
00:07:00.554 --> 00:07:01.954
Where are you from?

95
00:07:03.224 --> 00:07:05.960
London.
Oh.


96
00:07:05.961 --> 00:07:08.829
Like fish and chips and stuff?

97
00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:11.899
I've never left the state before.

98
00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:13.500
Well, you're a long
way from home now.


99
00:07:13.501 --> 00:07:16.370
Yeah. Long way from home.

100
00:07:16.371 --> 00:07:19.038
Bye, home.

101
00:08:08.922 --> 00:08:10.556
You must be Ellen.

102
00:08:12.993 --> 00:08:14.093
Welcome.

103
00:08:15.496 --> 00:08:16.963
It's good to be here.

104
00:08:23.304 --> 00:08:25.372
<i>Hi, my name is Simon Leach.</i>

105
00:08:25.373 --> 00:08:27.708
I'm 42 years old.
I'm from Alabama.


106
00:08:27.709 --> 00:08:29.976
And I love my new
life in his service.


107
00:08:32.713 --> 00:08:36.050
<i>My life was a mess</i>
<i>when he found me.</i>


108
00:08:36.051 --> 00:08:39.719
<i>I was just another lost soul looking
for meaning in the emptiness.</i>


109
00:08:40.321 --> 00:08:42.523
<i>I drank and I drugged.</i>

110
00:08:42.524 --> 00:08:45.326
Slept with wayward women,

111
00:08:45.327 --> 00:08:47.927
lost myself in all kinds of
sinful distractions.


112
00:08:49.063 --> 00:08:51.598
<i>And then one day,</i>

113
00:08:51.599 --> 00:08:55.001
<i>in a moment of deep personal
darkness, he found me.</i>


114
00:08:56.437 --> 00:08:59.973
<i>I had blood on my hands,</i>
<i>hate in my heart,</i>


115
00:08:59.974 --> 00:09:01.307
<i>but he didn't judge me.</i>

116
00:09:02.776 --> 00:09:05.646
<i>He set my spirit free that day.</i>

117
00:09:05.647 --> 00:09:08.915
I promised him I'd do anything
I could to repay him.


118
00:09:24.765 --> 00:09:28.701
<i>Well, I finally arrived
at the compound.</i>


119
00:09:30.771 --> 00:09:32.738
Looks like this is
gonna be my new room.


120
00:09:35.776 --> 00:09:38.578
Not quite sure
who my roommate is yet though.


121
00:09:50.858 --> 00:09:53.593
Hey, Mary.
Give me a little smile.


122
00:09:56.797 --> 00:09:58.798
That's my sunshine girl.

123
00:10:19.086 --> 00:10:21.722
- Shit!
- Hey.


124
00:10:21.723 --> 00:10:23.656
Sorry.
What's with the camera?


125
00:10:27.861 --> 00:10:29.663
You settling in okay?

126
00:10:29.664 --> 00:10:30.798
Yeah, I'm fine.

127
00:10:30.799 --> 00:10:31.932
Need anything?

128
00:10:31.933 --> 00:10:33.666
No, I'm good.

129
00:10:41.074 --> 00:10:42.742
You have a really pretty face.

130
00:10:43.143 --> 00:10:44.410
You look good on camera.

131
00:10:45.746 --> 00:10:47.013
Thanks.

132
00:10:50.617 --> 00:10:52.257
Hey, we're glad you're here.

133
00:10:53.687 --> 00:10:55.021
Thanks.

134
00:11:12.072 --> 00:11:15.274
They've locked me up in this
room so I have time to reflect.


135
00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:18.377
Hold on.

136
00:11:19.079 --> 00:11:20.680
What is that?

137
00:11:30.692 --> 00:11:31.824
Shit.

138
00:11:37.764 --> 00:11:39.500
Let me give you a little lesson

139
00:11:39.501 --> 00:11:40.801
in costume design.
Do you mind?


140
00:11:40.802 --> 00:11:43.804
Okay, go. Yeah.
Is it okay? Yeah?


141
00:11:43.805 --> 00:11:47.875
Earth tones, they
calm the brain. Neutrals.


142
00:11:47.876 --> 00:11:50.677
You'll always find priests and religious
figures wearing neutral tones.


143
00:11:50.678 --> 00:11:52.746
Whites.

144
00:11:52.747 --> 00:11:55.616
Look at altars, you'll
find soft neutral tones.


145
00:11:55.617 --> 00:11:58.819
Bright colors excite the mind
and we don't want that.


146
00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:03.290
So we've got an array of neutral
tones, of sands and whites.


147
00:12:03.291 --> 00:12:07.027
What do you think? Hold on.

148
00:12:07.028 --> 00:12:09.897
What do you think?
Wait, this is kind of
a western vibe here.


149
00:12:09.898 --> 00:12:11.164
It's very friendly.

150
00:12:11.165 --> 00:12:12.966
Hi, I'm Father Simon.

151
00:12:12.967 --> 00:12:14.835
I'm glad you're here.

152
00:12:14.836 --> 00:12:17.303
Tell me a little about yourself.
What do you think?


153
00:12:18.605 --> 00:12:19.673
No.

154
00:12:19.674 --> 00:12:20.874
No?
No.


155
00:12:20.875 --> 00:12:22.709
Fine. Okay.

156
00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:24.410
What do you think?
What do you think?


157
00:12:26.713 --> 00:12:28.749
Nice? Yeah?
Yeah.


158
00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:30.751
Hey, welcome.
Where are you from?
Tell me about your family.


159
00:12:30.752 --> 00:12:31.952
Who gives a fuck?

160
00:12:34.556 --> 00:12:36.489
No, but seriously,
tell me about yourself.


161
00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:39.059
Yeah. Yeah, what do you think?

162
00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:40.694
Yeah.

163
00:12:40.695 --> 00:12:41.795
Yeah? Button-down?

164
00:12:41.796 --> 00:12:43.030
Try the last one.

165
00:12:43.031 --> 00:12:44.231
I don't like that color.

166
00:12:44.232 --> 00:12:45.933
Damn, woman.

167
00:12:45.934 --> 00:12:47.701
All right, what do you see?
What do you like?


168
00:12:47.702 --> 00:12:49.570
Yeah, I like that one.

169
00:12:49.571 --> 00:12:50.704
Hi.

170
00:12:50.705 --> 00:12:51.771
Welcome.

171
00:12:52.906 --> 00:12:55.909
I wanna tell you
that I care about you.


172
00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:58.310
Don't tell any of
the other children this, but


173
00:12:59.313 --> 00:13:01.046
you're probably my favorite.

174
00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:04.316
I love you.

175
00:13:05.285 --> 00:13:07.688
I love you.

176
00:13:07.689 --> 00:13:12.960
This is the next in a series
of entrance interviews with Sister Tracy.


177
00:13:12.961 --> 00:13:14.927
Entrance interview
with Brother Alan.


178
00:13:15.696 --> 00:13:17.364
Brother Ben.

179
00:13:17.365 --> 00:13:19.800
Robin.

180
00:13:19.801 --> 00:13:22.769
Entrance interview,
Brother Brian.


181
00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:24.570
Entrance interview,
Brother Frank.


182
00:13:25.973 --> 00:13:28.307
Entrance interview,
Sister Grace.


183
00:13:32.045 --> 00:13:33.379
Veronica.

184
00:13:34.381 --> 00:13:35.916
Welcome, Sister.

185
00:13:35.917 --> 00:13:37.150
Thank you, Father.

186
00:13:37.151 --> 00:13:38.185
We're glad you're here.

187
00:13:38.186 --> 00:13:39.786
I'm really glad to be here.

188
00:13:39.787 --> 00:13:42.923
The purpose of the interview is

189
00:13:42.924 --> 00:13:45.826
for you to let people
know why you're here,


190
00:13:45.827 --> 00:13:48.961
how you came to be here, and
how you feel about being here.


191
00:13:49.229 --> 00:13:50.496
Okay.

192
00:13:52.799 --> 00:13:54.901
<i>Let me ask you something.</i>

193
00:13:54.902 --> 00:13:56.903
<i>Are you willing to be completely
and totally honest with me?</i>


194
00:13:56.904 --> 00:13:58.038
About everything?

195
00:13:58.039 --> 00:13:59.172
Yeah.

196
00:13:59.173 --> 00:14:01.141
'Cause like, I didn't have...

197
00:14:01.142 --> 00:14:05.812
Because I didn't have anywhere
else to go, I guess and I...


198
00:14:05.813 --> 00:14:07.314
Um...

199
00:14:07.315 --> 00:14:12.786
<i>'Cause everything else</i>
<i>was really bad and I...</i>


200
00:14:12.787 --> 00:14:14.388
Hey, Alan, what...
What was bad?


201
00:14:14.389 --> 00:14:16.423
You say things were bad,
everything was bad.


202
00:14:16.424 --> 00:14:18.457
What was bad?
I don't know.


203
00:14:19.259 --> 00:14:20.626
You'd run away, hadn't you?

204
00:14:23.263 --> 00:14:24.964
You'd run away from home?

205
00:14:27.968 --> 00:14:29.501
<i>Yes.</i>
<i>Why?</i>


206
00:14:34.307 --> 00:14:38.310
I couldn't live there anymore.

207
00:14:39.312 --> 00:14:41.682
Um... More physically...

208
00:14:41.683 --> 00:14:43.515
Did you have sex with him?

209
00:14:44.785 --> 00:14:46.053
I did.

210
00:14:46.054 --> 00:14:47.253
How old were you?

211
00:14:48.021 --> 00:14:49.022
Seventeen.

212
00:14:49.023 --> 00:14:50.724
How old was he?

213
00:14:50.725 --> 00:14:52.893
Forty-four.

214
00:14:52.894 --> 00:14:55.561
<i>What is a man?</i>
<i>What's a man to you?</i>


215
00:15:01.301 --> 00:15:05.472
A man's strong and he's able to

216
00:15:05.473 --> 00:15:07.940
take care of himself and

217
00:15:10.177 --> 00:15:13.313
he's not
a failure in life and...


218
00:15:13.314 --> 00:15:15.782
You think you're a failure?

219
00:15:15.783 --> 00:15:18.919
<i>But as I got older, the</i>

220
00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:21.453
<i>drinking got worse and</i>

221
00:15:24.858 --> 00:15:26.592
it became drinking and

222
00:15:27.861 --> 00:15:29.461
beating and

223
00:15:30.397 --> 00:15:32.799
fucking and

224
00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:34.768
drinking and
beating and fucking,


225
00:15:34.769 --> 00:15:36.136
and drinking and
beating and fucking,


226
00:15:36.137 --> 00:15:37.437
and drinking and
beating and fucking.


227
00:15:37.438 --> 00:15:39.206
I didn't leave a family.

228
00:15:39.207 --> 00:15:42.876
I left a woman and a man

229
00:15:42.877 --> 00:15:45.611
living for themselves and wanting
me to live for them as well.


230
00:15:47.414 --> 00:15:49.114
You need to be yourself.

231
00:15:49.950 --> 00:15:51.283
<i>You need that.</i>

232
00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:55.154
<i>And I never got that.</i>

233
00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:58.390
And that's what I want.

234
00:16:05.432 --> 00:16:06.498
I...

235
00:16:09.069 --> 00:16:11.470
I lost someone really close
to me a while ago.


236
00:16:12.939 --> 00:16:14.139
I'm sorry.

237
00:16:15.942 --> 00:16:17.343
And I...

238
00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:22.014
I kind of pushed everyone away.

239
00:16:23.884 --> 00:16:25.952
As you can see,
we don't have much.


240
00:16:25.953 --> 00:16:28.989
But I'll tell you what,
we make do.


241
00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:33.193
And here's some of our
children doing their laundry.


242
00:16:33.194 --> 00:16:36.328
Hey, Brother Ben. How are you?
What do you got there?


243
00:16:37.931 --> 00:16:39.331
Got your laundry there?

244
00:16:42.002 --> 00:16:43.602
Looks good, nice and clean.

245
00:16:45.338 --> 00:16:47.006
All right, carry on, Brother.

246
00:16:50.076 --> 00:16:52.145
We have Sister Grace,
Sister Ellen.


247
00:16:52.146 --> 00:16:54.146
Hi, Father Simon.

248
00:16:57.150 --> 00:16:59.352
Better be careful in there,
you might get a tidal wave.


249
00:17:14.601 --> 00:17:16.135
Well, it's...

250
00:17:17.037 --> 00:17:19.406
It's really not what I expected.

251
00:17:19.407 --> 00:17:22.608
But this group of people, I
don't think they'd hurt anyone.


252
00:17:23.944 --> 00:17:26.145
<i>Simon is definitely a crook, but</i>

253
00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:28.747
<i>I don't think he's murderous.</i>

254
00:17:31.084 --> 00:17:34.087
Mary's creepy, though.

255
00:17:34.088 --> 00:17:36.688
<i>Every time I'm around her,</i>
<i>my skin crawls.</i>


256
00:17:40.427 --> 00:17:42.094
I don't know.

257
00:17:44.331 --> 00:17:45.731
Why are we getting this again?

258
00:17:48.335 --> 00:17:50.202
'Cause we need the happy stuff.

259
00:17:50.604 --> 00:17:51.670
Okay?

260
00:17:58.945 --> 00:18:01.014
Hey, guys.

261
00:18:01.015 --> 00:18:03.383
Hi, Father Simon.
Father Simon.


262
00:18:03.384 --> 00:18:04.951
So we're gonna
have a camera chat


263
00:18:04.952 --> 00:18:07.254
and we're gonna find out
about what you're doing


264
00:18:07.255 --> 00:18:12.058
and tell everybody what we
do here, Sister Veronica.


265
00:18:12.059 --> 00:18:15.594
With your sweet smile.
And your nice dancing eyes.


266
00:18:15.662 --> 00:18:17.130
Are you Irish?

267
00:18:17.131 --> 00:18:18.665
Yeah, I am.

268
00:18:18.666 --> 00:18:21.134
You look like you got
some Irish in you there.


269
00:18:21.135 --> 00:18:23.235
Why don't you tell the people
what you're doing?


270
00:18:24.137 --> 00:18:27.272
We're sewing our caftans.

271
00:18:28.408 --> 00:18:30.510
To be ready for our transition.

272
00:18:30.511 --> 00:18:32.579
And each of
the children got to choose


273
00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:34.481
their own
pattern for the caftan.


274
00:18:34.482 --> 00:18:36.216
Right? Yeah?
That's right. Yes.


275
00:18:36.217 --> 00:18:40.253
So I'm guessing
yours is stylish?


276
00:18:40.254 --> 00:18:43.323
I don't know what it's gonna turn out like.
It's not that good.


277
00:18:43.324 --> 00:18:45.191
It's gonna be great, yeah.

278
00:18:45.192 --> 00:18:47.260
Thank you, Father Simon.

279
00:18:47.261 --> 00:18:51.231
It's really great being here

280
00:18:51.232 --> 00:18:54.267
because everyone is
really nice to me.


281
00:18:54.268 --> 00:18:56.603
Father Simon is...

282
00:18:56.604 --> 00:18:59.072
Just makes me feel at home

283
00:18:59.073 --> 00:19:03.476
and everyone else makes me feel
like I'm part of a family.


284
00:19:03.477 --> 00:19:06.211
You are at home and you
are part of the family.


285
00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:09.616
Thank you, my dear. So sweet.

286
00:19:09.617 --> 00:19:11.051
Seamstress Robin.

287
00:19:11.052 --> 00:19:12.585
Hard at work.

288
00:19:12.586 --> 00:19:17.590
She probably knows
the size of needles to use.


289
00:19:17.591 --> 00:19:20.427
If I had a sewing
machine for you, I bet you


290
00:19:20.428 --> 00:19:21.728
could just crank out
all kinds of things.


291
00:19:21.729 --> 00:19:23.129
I wish.

292
00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:25.031
This is good, though.

293
00:19:25.032 --> 00:19:28.401
These needles are good for
getting through the fabric.


294
00:19:28.402 --> 00:19:30.537
You probably wouldn't mind
sewing everyone's caftan.


295
00:19:32.273 --> 00:19:34.207
Well, but then they wouldn't
each be different.


296
00:19:34.208 --> 00:19:35.742
They'd all be the same.

297
00:19:35.743 --> 00:19:39.212
And that's just
a little part of the lesson,


298
00:19:39.213 --> 00:19:43.450
preparing your own caftans
because I prepared my own.


299
00:19:43.451 --> 00:19:47.754
We're family and each family
member has a responsibility


300
00:19:47.755 --> 00:19:51.224
and we work together
all for the common good.


301
00:19:51.225 --> 00:19:54.160
I am an idealist at heart

302
00:19:54.161 --> 00:19:58.031
and I'm still idealistic
enough even at this age to


303
00:19:58.032 --> 00:20:01.134
believe that it's possible to
work together for something good.


304
00:20:01.135 --> 00:20:02.235
You guys with me?

305
00:20:02.236 --> 00:20:03.303
Yes, Father Simon!

306
00:20:03.304 --> 00:20:04.570
Okay.

307
00:20:05.205 --> 00:20:08.008
Blessings on you, Sister.

308
00:20:08.009 --> 00:20:09.542
- Go, go, go, go, go!
- All right, come on.


309
00:20:09.543 --> 00:20:10.609
Whoo!

310
00:20:14.381 --> 00:20:17.216
All the way home.
All the way home. Nice.


311
00:20:25.625 --> 00:20:27.359
Go, go, go, go, go!

312
00:20:29.229 --> 00:20:32.564
Mary, Mary, Mary.

313
00:20:40.507 --> 00:20:42.241
I don't know what to say.

314
00:20:43.610 --> 00:20:45.277
It's fantastic.

315
00:20:47.614 --> 00:20:49.349
Where the hell did you get this?

316
00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:52.819
I like it, it's good.
It's a bent candle, it's nice.


317
00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:56.689
Universal religious symbolism
mixed with a little pagan shit.


318
00:20:56.690 --> 00:20:59.692
So the parrot turns to the
magician on the raft and he says,


319
00:20:59.693 --> 00:21:02.128
"Okay, I give up.
How'd you do the trick?"


320
00:21:05.833 --> 00:21:07.267
Is there love in this room?

321
00:21:07.268 --> 00:21:08.435
Yes, Father.

322
00:21:08.436 --> 00:21:09.302
Is there happiness in this room?

323
00:21:09.303 --> 00:21:10.503
Yes, Father.

324
00:21:10.504 --> 00:21:11.604
Is there trust in this room?

325
00:21:11.605 --> 00:21:13.173
Yes, Father.

326
00:21:13.174 --> 00:21:15.375
Take a step back.

327
00:21:15.376 --> 00:21:18.478
'Cause sometimes we need to trust
each other with a big thing.


328
00:21:18.479 --> 00:21:20.780
Not just a small thing.

329
00:21:20.781 --> 00:21:22.816
Yes?
Yes, Father.


330
00:21:22.817 --> 00:21:25.951
And we send trust to you,
Brother Frank.


331
00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:27.886
One,

332
00:21:28.621 --> 00:21:29.688
two,

333
00:21:30.623 --> 00:21:32.057
three!

334
00:21:35.295 --> 00:21:37.363
Hug your brothers and sisters!

335
00:21:37.364 --> 00:21:38.630
Yes.

336
00:21:41.601 --> 00:21:42.668
Yes.

337
00:21:44.104 --> 00:21:45.138
Other people...

338
00:21:45.139 --> 00:21:46.638
Other people...

339
00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:48.541
<i>are shadows.</i>

340
00:21:48.542 --> 00:21:50.243
<i>are shadows.</i>

341
00:21:50.244 --> 00:21:52.178
<i>We let the shadows go.</i>

342
00:21:52.179 --> 00:21:54.180
<i>We let the shadows go.</i>

343
00:21:54.181 --> 00:21:55.715
<i>Gently.</i>

344
00:21:55.716 --> 00:21:57.250
<i>Gently.</i>

345
00:21:57.251 --> 00:21:58.518
<i>Other people...</i>

346
00:21:58.519 --> 00:22:03.256
Sister Ellen, the more
of those lovely dishes you break


347
00:22:03.257 --> 00:22:05.191
the higher your points.

348
00:22:05.192 --> 00:22:06.459
You ready to try?

349
00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:07.827
Yeah?
Do you know how to do this?


350
00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:10.762
Have you done this before?

351
00:22:12.432 --> 00:22:15.235
I'll bet they don't
have this in London.


352
00:22:15.236 --> 00:22:16.968
In fact, I know they don't.

353
00:22:19.239 --> 00:22:20.972
- Here she goes.
- Just do it.


354
00:22:32.385 --> 00:22:34.425
<i>We've been learning
about each other.</i>


355
00:22:35.622 --> 00:22:38.458
There's someone here today

356
00:22:38.459 --> 00:22:40.793
who's feeling something
they haven't felt before.


357
00:22:40.794 --> 00:22:41.860
I know it.

358
00:22:43.196 --> 00:22:44.664
I can feel it.

359
00:22:44.665 --> 00:22:45.897
Who is that someone?

360
00:22:46.733 --> 00:22:48.467
Who is that someone?

361
00:22:51.404 --> 00:22:52.938
Sister Ellen.

362
00:22:55.175 --> 00:22:58.178
Don't deny it, Sister.
There's something changing in you.


363
00:22:58.179 --> 00:23:00.914
There's something changing inside you.
Do you see it in her eyes?


364
00:23:00.915 --> 00:23:02.515
Do you see it,
brothers and sisters?


365
00:23:02.516 --> 00:23:04.651
Yes, Father.

366
00:23:04.652 --> 00:23:06.319
Tell us.

367
00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:09.455
Tell us, share. Share.

368
00:23:09.456 --> 00:23:11.558
I don't know what to say.

369
00:23:11.559 --> 00:23:14.639
Don't hold back on us,
dear, please. We've given you everything.


370
00:23:15.795 --> 00:23:17.996
I don't know,
I guess, I don't know, I'm...


371
00:23:18.665 --> 00:23:20.465
I feel...

372
00:23:21.234 --> 00:23:22.701
I...

373
00:23:24.437 --> 00:23:26.906
I guess I feel like I

374
00:23:26.907 --> 00:23:29.342
am starting to
believe in something again.


375
00:23:29.343 --> 00:23:30.609
I don't know.
Yes.


376
00:23:49.596 --> 00:23:52.265
You look like you
really know what you're doing.


377
00:23:52.266 --> 00:23:54.567
Uh...

378
00:23:54.568 --> 00:23:56.502
It's nothing.
My dad was a contractor.


379
00:23:56.503 --> 00:23:58.671
He just taught me how to build.

380
00:23:58.672 --> 00:24:00.340
Yeah?
Yeah.


381
00:24:00.341 --> 00:24:03.009
I bet you could fix
just about anything.


382
00:24:03.010 --> 00:24:06.678
I could try.
I don't know if I could fix everything.


383
00:24:08.948 --> 00:24:11.618
I think that maybe later

384
00:24:11.619 --> 00:24:13.786
there's something in my room
that's broken maybe you could fix?


385
00:24:13.787 --> 00:24:14.921
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah?


386
00:24:14.922 --> 00:24:16.689
Of course, Father Simon.

387
00:24:16.690 --> 00:24:18.458
That'd be great. Thanks.
Of course.


388
00:24:18.459 --> 00:24:19.993
No problem.
I can help you with anything.


389
00:24:19.994 --> 00:24:22.761
Thank you. All right.

00:25:31.398 --> 00:25:35.335
I like knitting and I made
needles out of these spoons


397
00:25:35.336 --> 00:25:38.637
and I'm making
each of you a scarf.


398
00:25:45.812 --> 00:25:47.013
Yeah!

399
00:25:52.518 --> 00:25:56.089
Sister Ellen, have you a talent?

400
00:25:56.090 --> 00:25:58.758
Have you a talent, my dear?
Will you share it with us?


401
00:25:58.759 --> 00:26:00.292
Step to the front.

402
00:26:03.664 --> 00:26:04.996
All right.

403
00:26:12.605 --> 00:26:13.738
One more time.

404
00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:22.881
Mary...
It's fine.


405
00:26:25.051 --> 00:26:26.651
Just go.

406
00:26:28.654 --> 00:26:30.022
How long do I have to do this?

407
00:26:30.023 --> 00:26:31.323
For a while.

408
00:26:32.592 --> 00:26:34.127
But it's so boring.

409
00:26:34.128 --> 00:26:36.795
It makes me look thoughtful.

410
00:26:37.597 --> 00:26:39.297
It's still boring.

411
00:26:42.935 --> 00:26:45.738
Be sure you get this.
This looks good.


412
00:26:45.739 --> 00:26:47.072
Got it.

413
00:26:49.509 --> 00:26:50.709
And zoom out.

414
00:26:55.748 --> 00:26:57.049
Okay, you can go.

415
00:26:57.050 --> 00:26:58.283
Thank you.

416
00:26:59.585 --> 00:27:00.920
<i>You know I did.</i>

417
00:27:00.921 --> 00:27:01.987
<i>How?</i>

418
00:27:02.989 --> 00:27:04.457
You know.

419
00:27:04.458 --> 00:27:05.690
Yes, but they don't.

420
00:27:10.129 --> 00:27:13.065
Father Simon and I
talked a whole lot online


421
00:27:13.066 --> 00:27:17.804
and he told me the best
stories about his life


422
00:27:17.805 --> 00:27:20.405
and how good it
would be if I joined him.


423
00:27:21.808 --> 00:27:23.209
So what'd you do?

424
00:27:23.210 --> 00:27:25.478
I came and found you.

425
00:27:25.479 --> 00:27:26.845
You're happy?

426
00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:29.047
I guess so.

427
00:27:30.483 --> 00:27:31.883
Do you like peaches?

428
00:27:33.019 --> 00:27:34.220
Yes.

429
00:27:34.221 --> 00:27:35.754
Yeah, me too.

430
00:28:00.146 --> 00:28:02.387
You can do it.
You just gotta scrub harder.


431
00:28:03.749 --> 00:28:05.952
Harder.

432
00:28:05.953 --> 00:28:07.285
A little bit harder.

433
00:28:08.754 --> 00:28:10.288
See?

434
00:28:15.595 --> 00:28:17.235
<i>And this is our chore wheel.</i>

435
00:28:19.899 --> 00:28:22.902
Who would like to explain
how the chore wheel works?


436
00:28:22.903 --> 00:28:26.171
To show everybody how it works?
Veronica?


437
00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:29.275
Yeah,
what happens chore wheel day?


438
00:28:29.276 --> 00:28:31.944
On chore wheel day,
we just spin the wheel


439
00:28:31.945 --> 00:28:36.549
and whatever it lands on,
that's our chore for the week.


440
00:28:36.550 --> 00:28:38.584
Veronica, guess what?

441
00:28:38.585 --> 00:28:41.988
You get to pick the first
person to spin the wheel.


442
00:28:41.989 --> 00:28:43.256
Who do you pick?

443
00:28:43.257 --> 00:28:45.091
Um... Uh...

444
00:28:45.092 --> 00:28:46.825
I'll pick Ellen.

445
00:28:58.304 --> 00:29:00.004
Pump water.

446
00:29:02.875 --> 00:29:04.309
Brother Alan.

447
00:29:05.878 --> 00:29:07.879
Would you like to spin?
What's your favorite?


448
00:29:10.550 --> 00:29:13.686
I like doing the laundry.

449
00:29:13.687 --> 00:29:15.487
Okay. Here we go.

450
00:29:21.727 --> 00:29:24.697
Bathroom.

451
00:29:24.698 --> 00:29:27.300
Who hasn't gone?
Who have I missed?


452
00:29:27.301 --> 00:29:28.868
Who among
the children have I missed?


453
00:29:28.869 --> 00:29:30.169
Grace!

454
00:29:30.170 --> 00:29:32.004
Get up, Amazing Grace!

455
00:29:32.005 --> 00:29:33.271
All right.

456
00:29:34.574 --> 00:29:35.774
All right, Grace.

457
00:29:40.112 --> 00:29:41.980
It always sticks.

458
00:29:43.783 --> 00:29:45.685
Okay.

459
00:29:57.296 --> 00:29:59.231
Who loves chore wheel day?

460
00:30:03.370 --> 00:30:06.038
All right, guys, on the
count of three, we're all gonna get up


461
00:30:06.039 --> 00:30:09.909
we're gonna go do our chores and
work hard because we're a family.


462
00:30:09.910 --> 00:30:11.177
Who loves you?

463
00:30:11.178 --> 00:30:12.778
Father Simon.

464
00:30:12.779 --> 00:30:14.380
I love my children.

465
00:30:14.381 --> 00:30:18.283
Do what the chore
wheel told you! Let's go!


466
00:30:19.652 --> 00:30:21.519
Yeah. All right, let's go.

467
00:30:27.727 --> 00:30:29.795
Come on, hustle, hustle.

468
00:30:29.796 --> 00:30:31.831
- Tracy, I can catch.
- There we go.


469
00:30:31.832 --> 00:30:33.552
- It's okay. I got it.
- Good job there, T.


470
00:30:40.673 --> 00:30:41.774
Go get it.

471
00:30:41.775 --> 00:30:44.475
Keep going. Keep going. Run.

472
00:31:11.170 --> 00:31:13.610
I just wanna know your
thoughts and impressions.


473
00:31:16.042 --> 00:31:17.308
Um...

474
00:31:18.377 --> 00:31:22.380
I guess everyone
seems really nice.


475
00:31:23.849 --> 00:31:25.316
<i>It's peaceful.</i>

476
00:31:28.254 --> 00:31:30.955
<i>It seems like you have a nice</i>
<i>group of people around you.</i>


477
00:31:35.194 --> 00:31:36.461
<i>That's my first impression.</i>

478
00:31:39.331 --> 00:31:41.399
Where's that picture from?

479
00:31:42.468 --> 00:31:43.601
The waterfall.

480
00:31:45.104 --> 00:31:46.905
Have you been out
to the desert before?


481
00:31:47.073 --> 00:31:48.340
Yes.

482
00:31:48.341 --> 00:31:50.408
Yeah. Pretty out here.

483
00:31:52.378 --> 00:31:54.045
<i>I love what I do.</i>

484
00:31:56.449 --> 00:32:00.720
<i>And I hope maybe in some small
way it can be of some help,</i>


485
00:32:00.721 --> 00:32:02.687
<i>help you find whatever it is</i>
<i>you're searching for.</i>


486
00:32:05.858 --> 00:32:08.260
Anything you'd like to tell
people who might be watching this


487
00:32:08.261 --> 00:32:11.931
about our little
piece of paradise?


488
00:32:11.932 --> 00:32:13.598
Who's gonna be watching it?

489
00:32:40.893 --> 00:32:42.593
I think that's yours.

490
00:32:47.066 --> 00:32:48.533
How's it work?

491
00:32:53.506 --> 00:32:54.572
Um...

492
00:32:57.476 --> 00:32:58.778
You turn it on.

493
00:32:58.779 --> 00:33:00.044
Yeah?

494
00:33:14.226 --> 00:33:15.494
Can you zoom?

495
00:33:15.495 --> 00:33:17.028
Yeah, it's zoomed in.

496
00:33:18.931 --> 00:33:20.398
How's the mike on that thing?

497
00:33:21.066 --> 00:33:22.401
It's all right.

498
00:33:22.402 --> 00:33:24.135
I haven't used one before.

499
00:33:27.239 --> 00:33:29.374
Good memory?
Record a lot of stuff?


500
00:33:31.911 --> 00:33:33.245
Not bad.

501
00:33:33.246 --> 00:33:34.512
That's handy. That's good.

502
00:33:38.250 --> 00:33:39.584
I need one.

503
00:33:45.925 --> 00:33:46.791
Here.

504
00:33:49.094 --> 00:33:50.495
No, that's yours.

505
00:33:55.467 --> 00:33:57.469
That's a thing that gives
the lie to all the trust


506
00:33:57.470 --> 00:33:58.871
that we've been
trying to build up here.


507
00:33:58.872 --> 00:34:00.138
Simon.

508
00:34:03.342 --> 00:34:06.378
Have I done anything
to indicate or show you


509
00:34:06.379 --> 00:34:07.980
that I was trying to hurt you?

510
00:34:07.981 --> 00:34:11.183
Have I done anything
to earn the distrust?


511
00:34:11.184 --> 00:34:14.052
I need to know... I need to
know what happened to Janet.


512
00:34:15.554 --> 00:34:18.756
I need to know.
I need to know why she died.


513
00:34:24.930 --> 00:34:28.534
You weren't truthful with me,
but I'll be truthful with you.


514
00:34:28.535 --> 00:34:30.601
She died because of you.

515
00:34:33.339 --> 00:34:34.839
That's not true.

516
00:34:40.479 --> 00:34:42.348
We shared
everything with each other.


517
00:34:42.349 --> 00:34:45.483
Did you?
Did you know she
tried to kill herself?


518
00:34:46.418 --> 00:34:48.954
You're lying.

519
00:34:48.955 --> 00:34:50.456
Right after her husband left
and took the kids.


520
00:34:50.457 --> 00:34:53.626
No, she was depressed
and we talked about it.


521
00:34:53.627 --> 00:34:55.294
She stopped drinking
and she went to therapy.


522
00:34:55.295 --> 00:34:59.431
Now that I did know.
That helped for a while.


523
00:34:59.432 --> 00:35:00.498
For a while.

524
00:35:06.639 --> 00:35:08.172
She was so lonely.

525
00:35:09.108 --> 00:35:10.641
Poor Janet.

526
00:35:12.978 --> 00:35:15.346
But that all changed
the day she found our website.


527
00:35:17.383 --> 00:35:19.351
She told me that was the day

528
00:35:19.352 --> 00:35:22.687
she felt she was finally able to
connect with someone, really connect.


529
00:35:29.094 --> 00:35:30.695
She confessed her sins.

530
00:35:33.966 --> 00:35:36.501
The next day she
moved into our church.


531
00:35:39.305 --> 00:35:41.639
Would you like to
know how she died?


532
00:35:42.975 --> 00:35:44.642
What happened?

533
00:35:45.978 --> 00:35:48.247
We were fine.

534
00:35:48.248 --> 00:35:51.650
Everything was fine until stories
began to appear in the...


535
00:35:51.651 --> 00:35:53.251
Stories that were true.

536
00:35:55.054 --> 00:35:57.489
Lies.

537
00:35:57.490 --> 00:35:59.391
The same thing that always happens
when people come across something


538
00:35:59.392 --> 00:36:01.493
they don't
understand and they need


539
00:36:01.494 --> 00:36:03.327
an easy answer to
explain it away.


540
00:36:05.631 --> 00:36:08.100
And when the lies came,
the police came.


541
00:36:08.101 --> 00:36:09.501
That's what brought
the police to our door.


542
00:36:09.502 --> 00:36:11.437
So why did you shoot at them?

543
00:36:11.438 --> 00:36:15.307
We didn't.
They came in shooting.


544
00:36:15.308 --> 00:36:18.176
We tried to hide in the main room.
They burned us out.


545
00:36:21.246 --> 00:36:22.713
She saved my life.

546
00:36:27.519 --> 00:36:28.721
She was proud of you.

547
00:36:28.722 --> 00:36:30.589
No, she wasn't.

548
00:36:30.590 --> 00:36:32.658
She always talked about you.

549
00:36:32.659 --> 00:36:34.392
Her beautiful sister.

550
00:36:35.127 --> 00:36:37.261
She was so proud of you.

551
00:36:38.464 --> 00:36:40.132
She was happy, Ellen.

552
00:36:40.133 --> 00:36:41.599
She was happy.

553
00:36:47.606 --> 00:36:49.508
Look, I'm sorry I made you
cry, but now you understand


554
00:36:49.509 --> 00:36:52.177
why we tape
everything around here.


555
00:36:52.178 --> 00:36:54.046
Because people don't understand,

556
00:36:54.047 --> 00:36:55.680
because people
get the wrong ideas.


557
00:36:58.050 --> 00:37:01.186
And I'll be damned if I will
let any one of my followers


558
00:37:01.187 --> 00:37:04.723
ever be hurt by anybody.

559
00:37:04.724 --> 00:37:07.725
I want people to know
that we weren't monsters.


560
00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:23.608
I'm sorry I lied to you.

561
00:37:33.552 --> 00:37:35.421
In my hand

562
00:37:35.422 --> 00:37:36.954
I hold a recipe.

563
00:37:38.357 --> 00:37:40.558
It's a recipe for distrust.

564
00:37:41.193 --> 00:37:43.995
It's a recipe for fear.

565
00:37:45.364 --> 00:37:47.533
It's a recipe for hatred.
You know what it is?


566
00:37:47.534 --> 00:37:48.634
What is it?

567
00:37:48.635 --> 00:37:50.669
It's love.

568
00:37:50.670 --> 00:37:53.138
"Simon,
there's no love on the plate.


569
00:37:53.139 --> 00:37:56.608
"There's nothing but pens and papers.
There's no love there."


570
00:37:56.609 --> 00:37:59.445
There will be.

571
00:37:59.446 --> 00:38:01.447
'Cause we're each gonna
take a slip of this paper


572
00:38:01.448 --> 00:38:03.808
and we're gonna write something
about the person next to us.


573
00:38:06.151 --> 00:38:08.454
All right.

574
00:38:08.455 --> 00:38:10.522
Can everybody write?
'Cause I didn't ask that.


575
00:38:10.523 --> 00:38:14.793
You never know.
Just wanna make sure, right?


576
00:38:14.794 --> 00:38:17.796
Which way do we go?
This way or this way?


577
00:38:17.797 --> 00:38:20.466
I haven't decided that.

578
00:38:20.467 --> 00:38:24.336
Evan, if we will just wait for
instructions, then we will find out


579
00:38:24.337 --> 00:38:26.171
the way things are done
instead of jumping ahead.


580
00:38:26.172 --> 00:38:28.340
That's good, Father Simon.

581
00:38:28.341 --> 00:38:30.709
Here we are.
I know it's good because I said it.


582
00:38:30.710 --> 00:38:34.813
All right. Everybody write
something loving and affirming.


583
00:38:34.814 --> 00:38:37.748
I'm gonna join in, too.
I will write about


584
00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:40.686
Brother Brian.

585
00:38:40.687 --> 00:38:42.287
You will write
about Brother Frank.


586
00:38:42.288 --> 00:38:43.589
Who will write
about Sister Tracy.


587
00:38:43.590 --> 00:38:45.224
Who'll write
about Sister Veronica


588
00:38:45.225 --> 00:38:46.492
who will write
about Brother Ben,


589
00:38:46.493 --> 00:38:47.726
who will write
about Sister Ellen


590
00:38:47.727 --> 00:38:49.060
who will write
about Brother Alan.


591
00:38:53.365 --> 00:38:54.832
Time's almost up.

592
00:38:57.202 --> 00:38:58.469
All right.

593
00:38:58.770 --> 00:39:00.037
Let's begin.

594
00:39:03.308 --> 00:39:04.575
Brother.

595
00:39:05.777 --> 00:39:07.646
Read.

596
00:39:07.647 --> 00:39:09.613
Stand and read
for us, would you?


597
00:39:12.384 --> 00:39:15.586
"Brother Brian sings like a bird.
He also has nice eyes."


598
00:39:16.522 --> 00:39:17.689
It's true.

599
00:39:17.690 --> 00:39:18.757
Yes.

600
00:39:18.758 --> 00:39:20.826
Thank you, Father Simon.

601
00:39:20.827 --> 00:39:24.562
"Brother Frank is the most
amazing kickball player."


602
00:39:27.199 --> 00:39:28.532
Stand up.

603
00:39:32.772 --> 00:39:36.708
"Sister Tracy has the sweetest smile.
It lights up the whole place."


604
00:39:36.709 --> 00:39:38.710
How nice!

605
00:39:38.711 --> 00:39:42.447
"You are helpful and handy.
I love your birdhouse."


606
00:39:42.448 --> 00:39:44.115
It's really pretty.

607
00:39:47.452 --> 00:39:51.957
"Brother Ben, you are so loving
and kind, so considerate.


608
00:39:51.958 --> 00:39:53.624
"I love you."

609
00:39:53.859 --> 00:39:55.526
I love you, too.

610
00:39:58.197 --> 00:40:00.599
"You are so warm
that when you finally came,


611
00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:02.867
"our family felt complete."

612
00:40:04.203 --> 00:40:06.338
Thank you.

613
00:40:06.339 --> 00:40:09.975
"Brother Alan has
a beautiful smile."


614
00:40:09.976 --> 00:40:12.009
And there's a smiley face.

615
00:40:17.249 --> 00:40:20.451
"Brother Evan has nice eyes
and doesn't judge me."


616
00:40:26.658 --> 00:40:27.793
There it is.

617
00:40:27.794 --> 00:40:29.727
Sister?

618
00:40:30.929 --> 00:40:32.463
Father Simon.

619
00:40:35.934 --> 00:40:38.470
"Father Simon,

620
00:40:38.471 --> 00:40:41.639
"the most powerful man who
gives us strength and love."


621
00:40:42.874 --> 00:40:46.011
I wish it were true,
but I'm not powerful at all.


622
00:40:46.012 --> 00:40:48.012
I'm a very weak man.

623
00:40:49.881 --> 00:40:51.215
But with love,

624
00:40:51.950 --> 00:40:53.518
all things are possible.

625
00:40:53.519 --> 00:40:56.255
And with love, we are strong.

626
00:40:56.256 --> 00:40:58.856
And with love, we are family.

627
00:41:03.662 --> 00:41:05.364
<i>You know, when you
came in, you didn't smile much</i>


628
00:41:05.365 --> 00:41:07.631
and now you smile a lot.

629
00:41:08.367 --> 00:41:09.801
I know.

630
00:41:09.802 --> 00:41:11.370
I'm glad to see it.

631
00:41:11.371 --> 00:41:12.437
It's because of you,
Father Simon.


632
00:41:12.438 --> 00:41:13.972
Thank you.

633
00:41:13.973 --> 00:41:15.639
No. Thank you.

634
00:41:17.409 --> 00:41:18.877
Have you ever
thought about what you would say


635
00:41:18.878 --> 00:41:22.281
if you could say something to

636
00:41:22.282 --> 00:41:24.383
those who might be left behind
when you leave the earth?


637
00:41:24.384 --> 00:41:26.018
Have you thought about it?
Yes, Father.


638
00:41:26.019 --> 00:41:28.820
I guess everybody has.
I guess it's just human.


639
00:41:28.821 --> 00:41:31.023
I know I have.

640
00:41:31.024 --> 00:41:33.058
And I think the great
thing about our family


641
00:41:33.059 --> 00:41:35.560
is we have
the opportunity to do it.


642
00:41:35.561 --> 00:41:37.628
Because we're going
to a better place.


643
00:41:42.601 --> 00:41:45.070
It's hard.

644
00:41:45.071 --> 00:41:49.139
Because I've always been taught
to keep my feelings in check.


645
00:41:51.476 --> 00:41:54.879
But I feel free with you.

646
00:41:56.415 --> 00:41:58.950
I've never been more welcomed

647
00:41:58.951 --> 00:42:03.488
into a group of
strangers in my entire life.


648
00:42:03.489 --> 00:42:08.493
<i>I was around people for over

649
00:42:08.494 --> 00:42:11.563
didn't give a damn
whether I lived or died.


650
00:42:11.564 --> 00:42:14.632
I don't know that I've
done right by this world


651
00:42:16.034 --> 00:42:18.636
and I think I could
do better in the next.


652
00:42:20.472 --> 00:42:23.274
But I wanna please you.

653
00:42:24.676 --> 00:42:26.912
I'm scared, nervous.

654
00:42:26.913 --> 00:42:29.847
It's good,
it's a good scared-nervous.


655
00:42:33.552 --> 00:42:36.287
It's not that hard, you just
gotta have the balls to do it.


656
00:42:39.624 --> 00:42:41.493
I mean,
if you think you're happy


657
00:42:41.494 --> 00:42:43.929
like with, with your family
and like, working your job


658
00:42:43.930 --> 00:42:45.931
and like, going to school,
you're wrong.


659
00:42:45.932 --> 00:42:48.100
You guys, you're all wrong.

660
00:42:48.101 --> 00:42:50.034
And this is the best ever.

661
00:42:51.837 --> 00:42:55.440
This family, this group,

662
00:42:55.441 --> 00:42:57.908
has taken me in and
become my new family.


663
00:43:01.380 --> 00:43:02.881
<i>I guess I don't really
know what I'm looking for,</i>


664
00:43:02.882 --> 00:43:05.115
but I hope I find it here.

665
00:43:06.518 --> 00:43:07.818
I hope so, too.

666
00:43:15.761 --> 00:43:17.095
And when I

667
00:43:17.096 --> 00:43:18.929
see my father

668
00:43:20.098 --> 00:43:22.333
and show him who I've become,

669
00:43:24.936 --> 00:43:26.604
I'm good now.

670
00:43:32.878 --> 00:43:34.745
I don't know what else to say.

671
00:43:36.448 --> 00:43:38.850
<i>It's a surprise for someone.</i>

672
00:43:38.851 --> 00:43:40.919
It's a surprise for someone.

673
00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:42.554
What's going on?

674
00:43:42.555 --> 00:43:43.889
It's a surprise for someone.

675
00:43:43.890 --> 00:43:46.725
What's going on?
What's going on?


676
00:43:46.726 --> 00:43:50.194
Happy birthday!

677
00:43:53.899 --> 00:43:55.366
Yes!

678
00:43:58.770 --> 00:44:00.539
Each one of these candles

679
00:44:00.540 --> 00:44:03.374
represents someone in
your life who's hurt you,


680
00:44:04.176 --> 00:44:06.178
someone who's let you down,

681
00:44:06.179 --> 00:44:08.146
someone who's been mean to you,

682
00:44:08.147 --> 00:44:10.748
someone outside of the family.

683
00:44:11.450 --> 00:44:12.916
With all of your might

684
00:44:14.119 --> 00:44:15.719
blow their lives away.

685
00:44:20.492 --> 00:44:21.892
All dead!

686
00:45:00.565 --> 00:45:01.733
Simon.

687
00:45:01.734 --> 00:45:04.236
Not now, Mary.

688
00:45:04.237 --> 00:45:05.969
So what's going on with you?

689
00:45:08.039 --> 00:45:09.274
Nothin'.

690
00:45:09.275 --> 00:45:12.810
No, everything's good.

691
00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:19.717
Now, just between you and me and the
camera, is anything bothering you?


692
00:45:22.053 --> 00:45:23.088
You like being here?

693
00:45:23.089 --> 00:45:25.957
Yeah. Yeah, I love it.

694
00:45:25.958 --> 00:45:27.792
It's great.

695
00:45:27.793 --> 00:45:30.929
Yeah, I really...
I really like it.


696
00:45:30.930 --> 00:45:32.796
You making friends?
Yeah.


697
00:45:33.532 --> 00:45:35.065
All the kids?
Yeah.


698
00:45:35.867 --> 00:45:36.935
Yeah.

699
00:45:36.936 --> 00:45:39.070
Friends with Grace and...

700
00:45:39.071 --> 00:45:40.437
Ellen?
Yeah.


701
00:45:41.273 --> 00:45:42.607
Evan?

702
00:45:42.608 --> 00:45:43.907
Yeah.

703
00:45:46.278 --> 00:45:47.878
Yeah.
Yeah.


704
00:45:49.981 --> 00:45:52.250
<i>And then, I just went for it.</i>

705
00:45:52.251 --> 00:45:53.685
You know, I just...

706
00:45:53.686 --> 00:45:54.920
What do you mean?
What'd you do?


707
00:45:54.921 --> 00:45:56.855
Well, I kissed him.
Yeah.


708
00:45:56.856 --> 00:45:58.189
And then I just
leaned in and kissed him.


709
00:45:58.190 --> 00:45:59.991
Did he kiss you back?
Hmm?


710
00:45:59.992 --> 00:46:01.458
Did he kiss you back?

711
00:46:20.211 --> 00:46:21.313
Now.

712
00:46:24.950 --> 00:46:26.284
I'm sorry!

713
00:46:26.285 --> 00:46:29.820
I'm sorry! Sorry! I'm sorry!

714
00:47:18.803 --> 00:47:20.537
Do we have to film this?

715
00:47:22.941 --> 00:47:24.376
Would it make you
more comfortable


716
00:47:24.377 --> 00:47:26.811
if we turned
the camera to the wall?


717
00:47:26.812 --> 00:47:28.912
If you wouldn't mind, Father?

718
00:47:54.873 --> 00:47:57.942
<i>Now wait a minute.
I find this hard to believe.</i>


719
00:47:57.943 --> 00:47:59.476
You never had a boyfriend?

720
00:48:05.817 --> 00:48:08.485
I mean,
I could be your boyfriend.


721
00:48:10.221 --> 00:48:12.089
That'd be creepy.

722
00:48:12.290 --> 00:48:13.557
Why?

723
00:48:15.260 --> 00:48:18.929
Because you're my father.
You can't be both.


724
00:48:20.699 --> 00:48:23.500
What if I told you
that I can do anything I want?


725
00:48:29.374 --> 00:48:32.676
Here we have two of
my children in an intimate moment.


726
00:48:38.817 --> 00:48:40.417
What do you see in front of you?

727
00:48:45.757 --> 00:48:47.158
A girl.

728
00:48:47.159 --> 00:48:48.426
What's her name?

729
00:48:48.427 --> 00:48:49.693
Robin.

730
00:48:51.362 --> 00:48:52.696
What's her purpose?

731
00:48:54.499 --> 00:48:57.035
I don't know.

732
00:48:57.036 --> 00:48:59.904
Her purpose is to serve
you, son, because you're a man.


733
00:48:59.905 --> 00:49:01.172
Do you hear me?
Do you understand?


734
00:49:01.173 --> 00:49:02.974
Okay.

735
00:49:02.975 --> 00:49:04.776
And at this moment,

736
00:49:04.777 --> 00:49:07.378
you're looking at your
property and your playground.


737
00:49:07.379 --> 00:49:10.849
A thing of beauty and delicacy.

738
00:49:10.850 --> 00:49:13.283
Put your hands on
your property, son.


739
00:49:13.752 --> 00:49:14.618
Do it.

740
00:49:15.386 --> 00:49:16.454
Do it. Do it now.

741
00:49:16.455 --> 00:49:17.522
I don't know how.

742
00:49:17.523 --> 00:49:18.588
Okay.

743
00:49:21.426 --> 00:49:22.861
Is that the way you handle property?

744
00:49:22.862 --> 00:49:24.062
I don't know.

745
00:49:24.063 --> 00:49:25.163
Touch her.

746
00:49:25.164 --> 00:49:26.430
Higher.

747
00:49:26.531 --> 00:49:28.433
Higher.

748
00:49:28.434 --> 00:49:30.835
You know where to go.
Do it. Touch 'em.


749
00:49:30.836 --> 00:49:32.003
Put your hand on the other one.

750
00:49:32.004 --> 00:49:33.270
Okay.

751
00:49:34.172 --> 00:49:35.240
I'm sorry.

752
00:49:35.241 --> 00:49:36.573
Good. Just feel.

753
00:49:38.309 --> 00:49:40.043
Robin, how does it feel?

754
00:49:41.112 --> 00:49:42.746
Don't lie.

755
00:49:43.848 --> 00:49:45.216
How does it feel?

756
00:49:45.217 --> 00:49:46.717
It doesn't feel like anything.

757
00:49:47.252 --> 00:49:48.787
I'm sorry.

758
00:49:48.788 --> 00:49:53.525
Because Alan doesn't yet know
how to appreciate a woman.


759
00:49:53.526 --> 00:49:54.993
But he will.

760
00:49:54.994 --> 00:49:56.259
Kiss her.

761
00:49:57.796 --> 00:49:59.296
Kiss her, Alan.

762
00:50:03.067 --> 00:50:05.002
The other way, 
I can't see you.

763
00:50:06.304 --> 00:50:07.704
Kiss her.

764
00:50:09.841 --> 00:50:11.961
You're not kissing your goddamn
grandmother, kiss her.


765
00:50:23.588 --> 00:50:26.324
<i>Something's changed</i>

766
00:50:26.325 --> 00:50:28.592
<i>and everyone's acting scared,</i>

767
00:50:29.594 --> 00:50:32.463
<i>but they won't</i>
<i>tell me what's what.</i>


768
00:50:32.464 --> 00:50:34.532
<i>I don't know,</i>
<i>maybe they don't even know.</i>


769
00:50:34.533 --> 00:50:37.467
<i>Things just...</i>
<i>They feel heavier.</i>


770
00:50:39.103 --> 00:50:41.139
<i>Simon and Mary keep disappearing
for long hours at a time</i>


771
00:50:41.140 --> 00:50:44.241
<i>and when they get back, they run
us through even crazier drills.</i>


772
00:50:50.548 --> 00:50:53.318
It's getting harder to focus.

773
00:50:53.319 --> 00:50:55.519
<i>They're not</i>
<i>letting us sleep anymore.</i>


774
00:51:04.128 --> 00:51:06.130
<i>I wanna talk now.</i>

775
00:51:06.131 --> 00:51:09.634
<i>I'd like to talk about music.</i>

776
00:51:09.635 --> 00:51:12.102
<i>And the power that music
has to change people.</i>


777
00:51:14.172 --> 00:51:15.705
Some people.

778
00:51:19.010 --> 00:51:21.611
<i>The song</i> Amazing Grace,
<i>I've heard a million times.</i>


779
00:51:23.481 --> 00:51:25.615
<i>I heard it growing up in church.</i>

780
00:51:28.086 --> 00:51:30.588
I was a pretty bad kid.

781
00:51:30.589 --> 00:51:32.589
I didn't listen to
that stuff, you know?


782
00:51:35.126 --> 00:51:37.194
<i>Then one day that song came up</i>
<i>and it hit me</i>


783
00:51:38.263 --> 00:51:40.330
square in the face.

784
00:51:43.067 --> 00:51:45.503
I was in County, again,

785
00:51:45.504 --> 00:51:48.473
<i>trying to lower my points,</i>
<i>you know.</i>


786
00:51:48.474 --> 00:51:54.377
<i>Bullshit motherfucking
say-no-to-drugs meetings they had.</i>


787
00:51:56.247 --> 00:51:58.216
God.

788
00:51:58.217 --> 00:52:00.617
Sweet Jesus, it was boring.

789
00:52:01.586 --> 00:52:03.922
You know the routine.

790
00:52:03.923 --> 00:52:05.990
Some fat motherfucker gets up

791
00:52:05.991 --> 00:52:08.359
starts talking about how doing
blow made him suck dick.


792
00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:10.827
Whatever. I don't give a shit.

793
00:52:22.273 --> 00:52:26.377
<i>Then he starts</i>
<i>talkin' about that song.</i>


794
00:52:26.378 --> 00:52:29.347
About how it changed him, you know.
He was blind but now he sees.


795
00:52:29.348 --> 00:52:31.882
You know, blah, blah, blah,
I'm about half-listening.


796
00:52:35.453 --> 00:52:37.320
<i>Then he starts to sing.</i>

797
00:52:38.423 --> 00:52:40.490
<i>♪ Amazing Grace</i>

798
00:52:42.293 --> 00:52:44.761
<i>♪ How sweet the sound ♪</i>

799
00:52:52.270 --> 00:52:54.205
<i>He sung like an angel.</i>

800
00:52:54.206 --> 00:52:55.705
<i>Just like an angel.</i>

801
00:52:57.742 --> 00:53:00.611
So I figured

802
00:53:00.612 --> 00:53:03.014
"Hell,

803
00:53:03.015 --> 00:53:05.682
"if <i>Amazing Grace</i> could make
that fat fuck beautiful,


804
00:53:09.087 --> 00:53:11.888
"maybe it can do something
for the likes of me."


805
00:55:11.175 --> 00:55:13.576
<i>We were six when we first met.</i>

806
00:55:16.814 --> 00:55:18.415
She was my best friend.

807
00:55:23.154 --> 00:55:25.889
I think we knew even back then
we were gonna get married.


808
00:55:32.430 --> 00:55:34.298
She got pregnant.

809
00:55:34.299 --> 00:55:36.032
We were only 17.

810
00:55:36.734 --> 00:55:37.801
But...

811
00:55:40.138 --> 00:55:41.671
we weren't worried.

812
00:55:42.740 --> 00:55:44.708
We knew we'd make it work.

813
00:55:47.345 --> 00:55:49.480
She died.

814
00:55:49.481 --> 00:55:51.883
What happened?

815
00:55:51.884 --> 00:55:54.384
The baby cut off
her blood supply.


816
00:55:55.219 --> 00:55:56.786
What about the baby?

817
00:56:01.893 --> 00:56:04.896
Why would anyone blame you?

818
00:56:04.897 --> 00:56:07.030
It's my fault she got pregnant.

819
00:56:08.533 --> 00:56:11.668
And were they right?
Was it your fault?


820
00:56:15.907 --> 00:56:17.907
You think it was lust or love?

821
00:56:20.411 --> 00:56:21.946
It was love.

822
00:56:21.947 --> 00:56:23.747
You sure you
know the difference?


823
00:56:26.751 --> 00:56:28.451
Yes, Father.

824
00:56:29.220 --> 00:56:31.488
What are you afraid of? Most?

825
00:56:32.890 --> 00:56:34.657
Most of all?

826
00:56:35.293 --> 00:56:36.793
Don't lie.

827
00:56:39.964 --> 00:56:41.831
That I won't get
to see her again.


828
00:56:53.311 --> 00:56:54.644
Good.

829
00:57:05.289 --> 00:57:06.890
Let's talk about Mama.

830
00:57:10.561 --> 00:57:12.562
Mama didn't give
a shit about me.


831
00:57:13.431 --> 00:57:16.701
Or what happened to me.

832
00:57:16.702 --> 00:57:19.904
So I got in trouble real early
and real often, you know.


833
00:57:19.905 --> 00:57:23.307
<i>Petty theft, stole</i>
<i>some cars, shit like that.</i>


834
00:57:23.308 --> 00:57:25.442
<i>And I got caught a lot.</i>

835
00:57:27.578 --> 00:57:29.879
<i>She didn't do shit</i>
<i>to get me outta there.</i>


836
00:57:31.249 --> 00:57:32.984
<i>So I stayed.</i>

837
00:57:32.985 --> 00:57:34.719
And I didn't care.

838
00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:36.354
At least in there
the hot water worked.


839
00:57:36.355 --> 00:57:38.121
You know,
I got something to eat.


840
00:57:39.657 --> 00:57:41.959
God,
you see some things, though.


841
00:57:41.960 --> 00:57:45.363
Back up, baby,
let me show you something.


842
00:57:45.364 --> 00:57:48.498
The first time I saw a man
take another man's life,


843
00:57:50.301 --> 00:57:53.770
he stabbed him in
the eyeball for an orange.


844
00:57:54.639 --> 00:57:56.773
<i>A fuckin' orange.</i>

845
00:57:58.276 --> 00:57:59.709
I mean, fuck!

846
00:58:06.851 --> 00:58:08.386
<i>You don't getnothing for free in life.</i>

847
00:58:08.387 --> 00:58:13.623
<i>There's always somebody who wants
to get fucked or fuck you.</i>


848
00:58:17.862 --> 00:58:21.064
That's the only thing she ever
did say that made any sense.


849
00:58:24.502 --> 00:58:26.803
<i>I wonder what</i>
<i>she'd think of me now.</i>


850
00:58:39.450 --> 00:58:41.319
Fuck you, Mama!

851
00:58:41.320 --> 00:58:42.652
Fuck you!

852
00:58:44.922 --> 00:58:46.189
Turn it off.

853
00:58:48.592 --> 00:58:50.561
<i>Just being in this world?</i>

854
00:58:50.562 --> 00:58:53.064
<i>I'm here to tell you it
doesn't have to be that way.</i>


855
00:58:53.065 --> 00:58:55.965
You can call it what you will,
I call it a transition.


856
00:58:57.068 --> 00:58:59.737
But it's a change,
brothers and sisters.


857
00:58:59.738 --> 00:59:01.271
It's a change.

858
00:59:02.406 --> 00:59:04.173
And it's a hard way

859
00:59:05.509 --> 00:59:08.379
and I can't make you choose it.

860
00:59:08.380 --> 00:59:10.781
And if there's anyone
in this room right now


861
00:59:10.782 --> 00:59:12.983
if there's anyone
under the sound of my voice


862
00:59:12.984 --> 00:59:15.986
who feels that this
way is not for them,


863
00:59:15.987 --> 00:59:18.589
I wish, I beg,

864
00:59:18.590 --> 00:59:22.792
I plead for them to stand up
and walk out that door.


865
00:59:23.994 --> 00:59:26.664
And I swear to you
upon my honor as a man


866
00:59:26.665 --> 00:59:28.765
that you will not be stopped.

867
00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:33.269
I will turn my
back and I will wait.


868
00:59:35.005 --> 00:59:37.206
If you must leave, leave.

869
00:59:42.947 --> 00:59:44.280
Very well.

870
00:59:45.716 --> 00:59:47.685
Who's ready to feel that moment?

871
00:59:47.686 --> 00:59:48.986
I am ready, Father.
I'm ready.


872
00:59:48.987 --> 00:59:50.488
Who's ready to feel that power?

873
00:59:50.489 --> 00:59:52.121
I'm ready, Father.

874
00:59:53.991 --> 00:59:55.593
Brother Evan.
Yes?


875
00:59:55.594 --> 00:59:57.594
He tells me it is your time.

876
00:59:58.996 --> 01:00:00.697
Oh, my God.

877
01:00:08.539 --> 01:00:09.739
Thank you, Father.

878
01:00:10.608 --> 01:00:12.275
Celebrate with your brother.

879
01:00:13.144 --> 01:00:16.414
I love you! I love you!

880
01:00:16.415 --> 01:00:19.083
<i>Exit interview, 
Brother Evan.</i>

881
01:00:19.084 --> 01:00:21.018
<i>Hi.</i>
<i>Hi, Brother.</i>


882
01:00:21.019 --> 01:00:23.421
This is a great
opportunity for you


883
01:00:23.422 --> 01:00:27.591
to tell those who may
watch this in the future


884
01:00:27.592 --> 01:00:30.927
what you're feeling,
what you'd like them to know.


885
01:00:36.934 --> 01:00:40.805
This is it.

886
01:00:40.806 --> 01:00:45.141
<i>This is the only</i>
<i>holy place on earth.</i>


887
01:00:46.076 --> 01:00:49.747
<i>I feel sad for you</i>

888
01:00:49.748 --> 01:00:52.815
<i>because you will never experience
what we are experiencing.</i>


889
01:00:55.753 --> 01:00:57.420
We only live once.

890
01:00:58.556 --> 01:01:00.156
We only have one shot.

891
01:01:01.892 --> 01:01:03.426
And this is it.

892
01:01:06.564 --> 01:01:08.232
<i>Yes, Father.</i>

893
01:01:08.233 --> 01:01:10.067
<i>This is a moment of joy</i>

894
01:01:10.068 --> 01:01:13.003
for all of the family.

895
01:01:13.004 --> 01:01:15.672
We will soon be
reunited in our new home.


896
01:01:23.147 --> 01:01:24.914
Give me the camera.

897
01:01:26.517 --> 01:01:29.419
Now, now.

898
01:02:08.559 --> 01:02:09.992
Perfect.

899
01:02:11.295 --> 01:02:14.764
Absolutely perfect.

900
01:03:18.762 --> 01:03:22.366
Yesterday you saw
Brother Evan transition.


901
01:03:22.367 --> 01:03:23.432
Yeah.

902
01:03:25.102 --> 01:03:27.037
What was that like?

903
01:03:27.038 --> 01:03:28.237
I don't know.

904
01:03:31.241 --> 01:03:32.575
Yesterday,

905
01:03:34.311 --> 01:03:37.047
I got to witness

906
01:03:37.048 --> 01:03:41.517
the most beautiful thing I have
ever seen in my entire life.


907
01:03:44.088 --> 01:03:45.955
I was really happy.

908
01:03:48.258 --> 01:03:51.327
I knew that Brother Evan was

909
01:03:53.130 --> 01:03:56.599
in a better place,
a place I wanted to be in.


910
01:04:01.005 --> 01:04:02.138
Who's this guy?

911
01:04:05.376 --> 01:04:07.311
The truck?
Yeah.


912
01:04:07.312 --> 01:04:08.578
Yeah.

913
01:04:09.246 --> 01:04:11.315
You like trucks?
Yeah, I do.


914
01:04:11.316 --> 01:04:13.283
I've always liked trucks.

915
01:04:13.284 --> 01:04:15.384
Yeah. Yeah, they're strong.

916
01:04:17.254 --> 01:04:20.022
Do you want to talk about
Brother Evan's transition?


917
01:04:24.061 --> 01:04:27.129
Why don't you just
tell us what it was like?


918
01:04:30.367 --> 01:04:33.369
I don't know why,
I felt confused.


919
01:04:34.071 --> 01:04:35.471
Confused about what?

920
01:04:38.175 --> 01:04:40.076
I didn't want him to be in pain.

921
01:04:43.714 --> 01:04:45.448
Don't you find
that hard to watch?


922
01:04:49.853 --> 01:04:52.321
If it troubles you,
why didn't you stop it?


923
01:04:56.060 --> 01:04:59.228
I've asked myself that
and I don't know why.


924
01:05:01.732 --> 01:05:03.399
Should I have stopped it?

925
01:05:09.239 --> 01:05:11.159
<i>I don't know what</i>
<i>I'm doing here anymore.</i>


926
01:05:13.977 --> 01:05:15.578
<i>He was right.</i>

927
01:05:20.350 --> 01:05:21.951
She was alone.

928
01:05:25.089 --> 01:05:27.223
And I was too busy all the time.

929
01:05:33.897 --> 01:05:35.298
<i>I didn't listen to her.</i>

930
01:05:37.334 --> 01:05:40.037
<i>Not at all.</i>

931
01:05:40.038 --> 01:05:42.238
<i>She would try and tell me things</i>

932
01:05:46.110 --> 01:05:48.611
and I know it's too
late for her, but...


933
01:05:53.050 --> 01:05:56.585
<i>I decided to</i>
<i>stay and help Leach.</i>


934
01:05:59.256 --> 01:06:02.625
If he made her feel better,
maybe he'll do the same for me.


935
01:06:09.367 --> 01:06:10.499
Come.

936
01:06:24.047 --> 01:06:25.581
I'm ready.

937
01:06:26.917 --> 01:06:28.417
You sure?

938
01:06:29.119 --> 01:06:30.586
Yes, Father.

939
01:06:33.190 --> 01:06:34.991
I wanna feel what she felt.

940
01:06:37.127 --> 01:06:38.661
You're unhappy, aren't you?

941
01:06:48.972 --> 01:06:51.108
This is a
special night, my children.


942
01:06:51.109 --> 01:06:52.575
Yes, Father.

943
01:06:54.178 --> 01:06:56.180
Our last member

944
01:06:56.181 --> 01:07:00.317
has expelled the fear in her
heart and she shall join us.


945
01:07:00.318 --> 01:07:01.517
Yes, Father.

946
01:07:09.193 --> 01:07:10.659
Are you ready to join us?

947
01:07:12.362 --> 01:07:13.629
Yes, Father.

948
01:07:27.845 --> 01:07:29.525
<i>Can I share a story with you?</i>

949
01:07:33.584 --> 01:07:35.584
So I'm 18 years old, right?

950
01:07:36.420 --> 01:07:38.187
And I get a girl pregnant.

951
01:07:39.590 --> 01:07:43.594
And it's complicated by the
fact that we're in love.


952
01:07:43.595 --> 01:07:46.196
And her mama didn't like it,
and my mama didn't like it


953
01:07:46.197 --> 01:07:50.133
so we were cast out
on our own, you know.


954
01:07:50.134 --> 01:07:53.604
I took a job at the burger joint,
mowed lawns on the weekends.


955
01:07:53.605 --> 01:07:58.207
A few months go by, she goes into
labor and she loses the baby.


956
01:07:59.476 --> 01:08:01.544
And I lose her.

957
01:08:04.147 --> 01:08:06.483
They had to cut her open
and bled too much.


958
01:08:06.484 --> 01:08:08.151
There was nothing
they could do, you know.


959
01:08:08.152 --> 01:08:09.585
It was over real quick.

960
01:08:12.055 --> 01:08:14.191
So what do you do

961
01:08:14.192 --> 01:08:16.326
when the worst thing,

962
01:08:16.327 --> 01:08:20.397
the worst thing you can possibly
imagine, actually happens?


963
01:08:20.398 --> 01:08:21.797
What do you do?

964
01:08:56.533 --> 01:09:00.304
We're always going through life
and we're just getting by.


965
01:09:00.305 --> 01:09:05.541
<i>And doing what they're told to do,
but you don't have to do that.</i>


966
01:09:08.478 --> 01:09:11.580
You can do what you want
and you can be happy.


967
01:09:22.159 --> 01:09:24.962
Is everyone ready for
our next transition?


968
01:09:24.963 --> 01:09:26.562
Yes, Father.

969
01:09:28.565 --> 01:09:30.367
Brother Frank.

970
01:09:30.368 --> 01:09:32.002
Hi, Father.

971
01:09:32.003 --> 01:09:33.869
Mary, if you would.

972
01:09:36.606 --> 01:09:38.075
Brother Frank...

973
01:09:38.076 --> 01:09:40.677
Yes, Father.

974
01:09:40.678 --> 01:09:43.279
You've done all
that you can so far.


975
01:09:46.016 --> 01:09:49.619
You've purged
the poison from your soul.


976
01:09:49.620 --> 01:09:52.188
He knows that
you're here to serve him.


977
01:09:54.091 --> 01:09:56.725
He doesn't want to lose you
to the other side.


978
01:09:58.228 --> 01:10:02.165
He knows the pain
that you've suffered.


979
01:10:02.166 --> 01:10:04.700
It's time to take the first
step toward forgiveness.


980
01:10:06.036 --> 01:10:08.772
Are you ready
for your moment of revelation?


981
01:10:08.773 --> 01:10:10.472
Yes, Father.

982
01:10:35.499 --> 01:10:36.732
My brother,

983
01:10:38.502 --> 01:10:39.702
go in peace.

984
01:10:40.637 --> 01:10:41.904
I love you, Father.

985
01:10:45.108 --> 01:10:46.642
Mary, the lights.

986
01:10:49.046 --> 01:10:50.380
I love you, my son.

987
01:10:50.381 --> 01:10:52.014
I love you, Father.

988
01:10:53.383 --> 01:10:54.717
Children,

989
01:10:55.819 --> 01:10:57.620
set him free.

990
01:10:58.622 --> 01:11:00.856
Our father, thou art in Heaven.

991
01:11:14.838 --> 01:11:18.642
We will honor and remember
your moment of revelation.


992
01:11:18.643 --> 01:11:22.846
We will honor and remember
your moment of revelation.


993
01:11:22.847 --> 01:11:26.582
We will honor and remember
your moment of revelation.


994
01:11:38.261 --> 01:11:40.996
<i>Now who will be
next to make the transition?</i>


995
01:11:42.365 --> 01:11:44.300
Draw well,
my brothers and sisters.


996
01:11:45.235 --> 01:11:46.835
What an honor it would be.

997
01:11:48.105 --> 01:11:49.705
Brother Ben.

998
01:11:56.813 --> 01:11:57.880
Yes?

999
01:12:00.250 --> 01:12:01.517
Brother Alan.

1000
01:12:12.395 --> 01:12:13.662
Sister Robin.

1001
01:12:26.776 --> 01:12:28.110
She's next.

1002
01:12:41.458 --> 01:12:43.193
Why are you crying
on your day of joy?


1003
01:12:43.194 --> 01:12:44.593
I'm sorry.

1004
01:13:03.446 --> 01:13:04.980
I believed in you.

1005
01:13:08.518 --> 01:13:11.453
I believed in you
when no one else would.


1006
01:13:14.391 --> 01:13:16.125
I'm just scared.

1007
01:13:17.794 --> 01:13:19.895
And all that
I've asked in return


1008
01:13:21.531 --> 01:13:23.632
is that you have
a little faith in me.


1009
01:13:29.873 --> 01:13:31.940
Sister Robin has
pierced my soul.


1010
01:13:34.744 --> 01:13:36.478
Is there not one who has faith?

1011
01:13:38.481 --> 01:13:41.150
Is there not one
who has faith in me?


1012
01:13:42.652 --> 01:13:44.955
Sister?

1013
01:13:44.956 --> 01:13:46.989
Father. I have faith.

1014
01:13:48.325 --> 01:13:49.858
Lovest thou me?

1015
01:13:51.461 --> 01:13:52.829
Do you love me?

1016
01:13:52.830 --> 01:13:54.564
I love you, Father.

1017
01:13:54.565 --> 01:13:55.632
Do you love me
more than this one?


1018
01:13:55.633 --> 01:13:56.933
Yes.

1019
01:13:56.934 --> 01:13:57.867
Do you love me more than her?

1020
01:13:57.868 --> 01:13:59.134
Yes.

1021
01:13:59.803 --> 01:14:01.938
I shall show you faith.

1022
01:14:01.939 --> 01:14:04.940
I shall show you
faith and you shall see.


1023
01:14:17.455 --> 01:14:19.489
I don't fucking care!
I said, on your knees!


1024
01:14:19.490 --> 01:14:22.759
Get down on your fucking knees!
And you fucking stay there!


1025
01:14:22.760 --> 01:14:25.862
You understand me?
Do you understand me?


1026
01:14:25.863 --> 01:14:27.963
I don't care what
you fucking thought.


1027
01:14:28.465 --> 01:14:30.533
Get up! Get up!

1028
01:14:30.534 --> 01:14:32.134
Open the fucking gate!

1029
01:14:33.870 --> 01:14:35.671
Get the fuck out of here!

1030
01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:38.507
Run, bitch!

1031
01:14:53.890 --> 01:14:55.524
Stay there!

1032
01:15:52.615 --> 01:15:55.552
Robin wasn't
worthy of her moment.


1033
01:15:55.553 --> 01:15:58.687
She lost her transition
to the outside world.


1034
01:16:05.962 --> 01:16:07.596
When I was a kid,

1035
01:16:08.631 --> 01:16:10.299
I found this puppy.

1036
01:16:14.104 --> 01:16:17.707
But my timing was off.

1037
01:16:17.708 --> 01:16:22.379
See, Mama was bad to drink, she
wasn't studying no puppy that day.


1038
01:16:22.380 --> 01:16:26.116
Mama was studying teaching me
how to tie my shoes.


1039
01:16:26.117 --> 01:16:29.686
I'd been trying it maybe six
months, but I couldn't get it.


1040
01:16:29.687 --> 01:16:32.220
No matter how I tried,
I couldn't get it.


1041
01:16:33.423 --> 01:16:34.957
She took Phil and she

1042
01:16:35.892 --> 01:16:38.060
hung him outside the window.

1043
01:16:39.429 --> 01:16:41.096
She told me I had 30 seconds.

1044
01:16:43.099 --> 01:16:44.600
I tried.

1045
01:16:44.968 --> 01:16:46.768
God, I tried.

1046
01:16:50.907 --> 01:16:53.609
His head cracked
open like an egg.


1047
01:16:54.644 --> 01:16:56.178
Whose fault was it?

1048
01:16:57.647 --> 01:16:59.181
It was mine.

1049
01:17:00.917 --> 01:17:03.652
'Cause I wasn't strong enough
to keep him safe.


1050
01:18:13.590 --> 01:18:15.724
Are you fucking kidding me?

1051
01:18:22.932 --> 01:18:24.299
Mary!

1052
01:18:25.735 --> 01:18:28.204
Mary!

1053
01:18:28.205 --> 01:18:30.005
You said they were
all under control!


1054
01:18:39.582 --> 01:18:42.818
That son of a bitch is gonna go
to the police and you know it.


1055
01:18:52.061 --> 01:18:54.597
It's comin'.

1056
01:18:54.598 --> 01:18:55.998
I'll get them in the big room.

1057
01:19:01.871 --> 01:19:04.206
<i>I'm finally happy</i>
<i>for the first time.</i>


1058
01:19:07.176 --> 01:19:09.177
For the first time, I feel like

1059
01:19:10.280 --> 01:19:12.080
I'm finally home.

1060
01:19:14.617 --> 01:19:16.952
You know what I
wanna be remembered as?


1061
01:19:19.022 --> 01:19:21.490
As someone who finally said
what they thought.


1062
01:19:23.326 --> 01:19:24.993
Like, I feel...

1063
01:19:25.929 --> 01:19:29.197
It's warm and it's...

1064
01:19:31.067 --> 01:19:34.337
It's so wonderful.

1065
01:19:34.338 --> 01:19:36.619
Do you trust me
more than your blood family?


1066
01:19:37.240 --> 01:19:39.040
Yes, Father.

1067
01:19:40.777 --> 01:19:43.078
Have you thought
about your own moment?


1068
01:19:45.782 --> 01:19:47.215
I just...

1069
01:19:48.985 --> 01:19:51.020
I just think
about the better place


1070
01:19:51.021 --> 01:19:52.988
and I trust
the transition to you.


1071
01:19:54.591 --> 01:19:57.193
I wanna feel that pain.

1072
01:19:57.194 --> 01:19:59.127
I want it to happen now.

1073
01:20:00.863 --> 01:20:02.998
Dear God,
could you be more perfect?


1074
01:20:05.835 --> 01:20:07.435
I know you won't understand.

1075
01:20:09.739 --> 01:20:11.473
I know what you'll think.

1076
01:20:12.275 --> 01:20:13.975
<i>I want you to know I love you.</i>

1077
01:20:17.113 --> 01:20:19.581
I want you to know
it's not your fault.


1078
01:20:22.986 --> 01:20:25.922
But you never could have made
me as happy as I am now.


1079
01:20:25.923 --> 01:20:28.590
Because of me,
because of who I am.


1080
01:20:33.329 --> 01:20:34.930
And I'll always think of you.

1081
01:20:38.801 --> 01:20:40.001
Perfection.

1082
01:20:42.639 --> 01:20:44.306
<i>I'm nervous, but in a good way.</i>

1083
01:20:45.908 --> 01:20:47.175
Like Christmas.

1084
01:20:48.911 --> 01:20:50.178
Are you afraid?

1085
01:20:50.947 --> 01:20:52.214
No.

1086
01:20:55.318 --> 01:20:57.252
Do you have any last words?

1087
01:20:58.855 --> 01:21:00.989
I just wanna thank you
for all you taught me.


1088
01:21:02.325 --> 01:21:04.993
Because of you,
I'm now clear and free.


1089
01:21:07.130 --> 01:21:09.130
I don't feel alone anymore.

1090
01:21:10.066 --> 01:21:11.600
And I don't fear death.

1091
01:21:14.270 --> 01:21:16.706
I want everyone that follows me

1092
01:21:16.707 --> 01:21:18.874
to know that I
feel your love inside.


1093
01:21:22.078 --> 01:21:24.079
I'm joining my new family now.

1094
01:21:26.082 --> 01:21:27.616

Yes.

1098
01:21:38.728 --> 01:21:39.929
Will you always love me?

1099
01:21:39.930 --> 01:21:41.062

not too many, not too few.

<i>waiting for Prince Charming.</i>

1130
01:23:12.421 --> 01:23:15.892
We have Veronica, my redhead.

1131
01:23:15.893 --> 01:23:17.592
<i>She's thrown in just</i>
<i>to spice things up.</i>


1132
01:23:25.301 --> 01:23:26.568
<i>We have Ellen.</i>

1133
01:23:28.805 --> 01:23:32.607
That Ellen may be
the girl of my dreams.


1134
01:23:36.813 --> 01:23:38.815
Are you ready to transition?

1135
01:23:38.816 --> 01:23:40.016
Yes, Father.

1136
01:23:40.017 --> 01:23:41.249
Are you afraid?

1137
01:23:41.884 --> 01:23:43.419
No, Father.

1138
01:23:43.420 --> 01:23:44.753
Let her have the gun.

1139
01:23:46.155 --> 01:23:48.024
What?
Give it to her.


1140
01:23:48.025 --> 01:23:49.559
Why?

1141
01:23:49.560 --> 01:23:51.226
Let her do it herself.

1142
01:23:52.295 --> 01:23:53.561
Mary!

1143
01:23:56.899 --> 01:23:58.067
Now do as we said.

1144
01:24:02.038 --> 01:24:03.238
Good girl.

1145
01:24:05.174 --> 01:24:06.574
Good girl.

1146
01:24:10.346 --> 01:24:11.613
What now?

1147
01:24:12.481 --> 01:24:13.748
Just like Janet.

1148
01:24:44.647 --> 01:24:46.247
I love you, Father.

1149
01:25:31.494 --> 01:25:33.329
Look, it's real simple.
Here's the zoom.


1150
01:25:33.330 --> 01:25:36.331
In. Zoom out is right there.

1151
01:25:37.099 --> 01:25:39.368
Here's your focus. You see?

1152
01:25:39.369 --> 01:25:42.505
Just keep it on auto focus.
A lot easier.


1153
01:25:42.506 --> 01:25:45.374
Frame me up here.
Don't get my profile, okay?


1154
01:25:45.375 --> 01:25:48.110
Just always three-quarters.
Right, don't zoom in unless I tell you to.


1155
01:25:48.111 --> 01:25:49.712
No profiles,
you keep that in mind,


1156
01:25:49.713 --> 01:25:52.181
we're gonna be fine, all right?

1157
01:25:52.182 --> 01:25:54.383
Don't worry, you'll get the hang of it.
You're gonna be fine.


1158
01:25:54.384 --> 01:25:55.583
I trust you.
