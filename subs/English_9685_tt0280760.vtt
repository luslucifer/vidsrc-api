1
00:01:23.706 --> 00:01:25.970
Why couldn't she have been
a fucking smoker?


2
00:01:26.042 --> 00:01:29.876
This has nothing to do with
her being in such wonderful shape.


3
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.445
The cause of our trouble
was our inability to come up with a drug...


4
00:01:33.516 --> 00:01:37.316
...short of paint thinner, that would be
at least somewhat novel to her system.


5
00:01:38.021 --> 00:01:40.046
She's built up a tolerance to everything.

6
00:01:40.523 --> 00:01:43.287
A tolerance?
She's taking her fucking afternoon nap.


7
00:01:43.493 --> 00:01:44.619
Shut up, lgby!

8
00:01:45.428 --> 00:01:46.417
We're fine.

9
00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:04.169
It's all the fucking tennis.

10
00:02:16.125 --> 00:02:17.717
It's almost 6:00.

11
00:02:30.273 --> 00:02:31.365
Igby.

12
00:03:34.337 --> 00:03:37.431
They'll do it. I don't know what it is,
but I know they'll do it.


13
00:03:37.507 --> 00:03:41.307
-Let's all drink to Bay State--
-Let's drink to Julia. Have you met her yet?


14
00:03:41.377 --> 00:03:43.345
If she's anything like her sister....

15
00:03:43.846 --> 00:03:48.647
We'll drink to Johnny and Julia and Bay
State Power and love and happiness and....


16
00:03:49.018 --> 00:03:50.986
Here you are.

17
00:03:51.054 --> 00:03:53.522
For the love of Pete,
it's the Witch and Dopey.


18
00:03:54.257 --> 00:03:57.784
I've never been up here before.
It's awfully quaint, isn't it?


19
00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:58.952
We like it.

20
00:03:59.295 --> 00:04:01.889
Dad, when are you going back to work?

21
00:04:03.566 --> 00:04:04.692
Soon.

22
00:04:05.101 --> 00:04:07.126
-You're not really sick anymore.
-No.


23
00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:09.797
Not really sick.

24
00:04:09.872 --> 00:04:13.808
But not completely well.
Not yet, I don't think.


25
00:04:15.044 --> 00:04:17.569
-When will you be better?
-ln the spring.


26
00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.715
-The spring?
-I'm no good in the winter.


27
00:04:21.184 --> 00:04:22.845
These gray days...

28
00:04:23.853 --> 00:04:25.218
...they're so sad.

29
00:04:25.955 --> 00:04:27.855
What about next winter?

30
00:04:52.215 --> 00:04:56.618
Jason, tell me, dearest,
are you planning on bathing this week?


31
00:04:57.286 --> 00:04:58.446
I beg your pardon?

32
00:04:58.521 --> 00:05:00.614
It seems to have slipped
your mind last week.


33
00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.124
-But I'm not dirty.
-No...


34
00:05:03.526 --> 00:05:08.361
...dirty, I mean, you've done nothing that'd
make you dirty for quite some time now.


35
00:05:09.565 --> 00:05:12.432
But you do reek, darling,
of tobacco, from your...


36
00:05:12.502 --> 00:05:15.801
...yellow toenails to your yellow fingernails
to your yellow teeth...


37
00:05:15.872 --> 00:05:17.635
...to your yellow hair.

38
00:05:18.808 --> 00:05:20.708
Sorry to have offended.

39
00:05:21.144 --> 00:05:22.168
Me?

40
00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.609
A piece of gristle.

41
00:05:29.685 --> 00:05:31.915
Not on an empty stomach, dear.

42
00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:40.960
Excuse me.

43
00:06:10.059 --> 00:06:14.120
Boys, your mother was quite right
to have chastised me.


44
00:06:16.265 --> 00:06:18.199
Good personal hygiene...

45
00:06:18.267 --> 00:06:22.966
...is one of the most essential disciplines
a man can have...


46
00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:25.166
...in this world.

47
00:06:26.375 --> 00:06:27.706
Chin-chin!

48
00:06:42.024 --> 00:06:44.254
Don't indulge him anymore.

49
00:06:44.327 --> 00:06:46.887
How can anyone be afraid of a clown?

50
00:06:47.263 --> 00:06:48.457
Just leave him.

51
00:06:48.531 --> 00:06:52.524
C'mon, old man.
This is no way to be on your birthday.


52
00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:56.165
Everybody's gone home.

53
00:06:59.275 --> 00:07:03.143
There's nobody left downstairs.
It's just you and me, now.


54
00:07:06.482 --> 00:07:07.471
Hey.

55
00:07:08.551 --> 00:07:12.112
It's just you and me, old man.

56
00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:39.873
If Heaven is such a wonderful place...

57
00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:44.381
...then how was getting crucified
such a big fucking sacrifice?


58
00:07:50.593 --> 00:07:54.393
Mrs. Slocumb,
it's wonderful to see you again.


59
00:07:54.664 --> 00:07:55.858
I hope you drove.

60
00:07:55.932 --> 00:07:59.231
No more beautiful place on God's earth...

61
00:07:59.302 --> 00:08:01.532
...than Connecticut at Christmas time.

62
00:08:01.604 --> 00:08:04.732
-Oliver drove me down from the city.
-Please.


63
00:08:05.708 --> 00:08:08.541
Congratulations on Oliver.

64
00:08:08.611 --> 00:08:11.205
I hear he's already established himself...

65
00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:14.272
...as the cream of
the Columbia freshman crop.


66
00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:18.446
We do take a lot of pride
in seeing our boys succeed.


67
00:08:18.521 --> 00:08:21.251
But of course, we're here to discuss...

68
00:08:21.524 --> 00:08:22.786
...Igby.

69
00:08:26.228 --> 00:08:30.130
Honor roll? You flunked everything.
Not even a 'D' in art this time.


70
00:08:30.199 --> 00:08:32.963
-Did you enjoy making me look like a fool?
-I dunno.


71
00:08:33.102 --> 00:08:34.262
You don't know?

72
00:08:34.403 --> 00:08:37.429
Poor Mrs. Slocumb doesn't have a clue
what old lgby is up to.


73
00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:40.441
-Dithering, foolish lady. Did you enjoy that?
-I dunno.


74
00:08:41.043 --> 00:08:42.635
-I beg your pardon?
-No!


75
00:08:42.712 --> 00:08:46.113
Then what are you? 
A pathological liar?

76
00:08:46.749 --> 00:08:47.773
I don't know.

77
00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:50.375
You don't know? Liar! 
You little liar!

78
00:08:50.453 --> 00:08:54.787
How dare you! And where were you when
your brother was flunking out of school?


79
00:08:54.857 --> 00:08:56.347
I was in college.

80
00:08:56.425 --> 00:08:58.586
Igby is not my fault.

81
00:09:00.596 --> 00:09:03.087
Did you even, for a second...

82
00:09:03.165 --> 00:09:05.224
...think about how this reflects upon me?

83
00:09:05.835 --> 00:09:06.859
No.

84
00:09:08.537 --> 00:09:13.304
I am not going to go through this again.
You had a chance. You flunked everything.


85
00:09:13.376 --> 00:09:15.571
That's almost impressive. It really is.

86
00:09:15.645 --> 00:09:18.011
You know what's going to
happen to you now, mister?


87
00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:22.312
Do you know where your sterling
performance is going to take you now...


88
00:09:23.586 --> 00:09:25.110
...Iittle man?

89
00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:29.084
Choate?

90
00:09:30.726 --> 00:09:33.718
-Cadet report!
-Oh, shit!


91
00:09:34.597 --> 00:09:36.064
Second watch is early.

92
00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:39.124
Lights out!

93
00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:42.794
In your bunks!

94
00:09:43.205 --> 00:09:45.230
You heard him. Let's go!

95
00:09:46.642 --> 00:09:49.543
All right, Mr. 
Patterson, lights out!

96
00:09:50.179 --> 00:09:53.273
What part of "lights out"
don't you understand?


97
00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:57.810
-Turtle! The spray!
-ln your bunk, Mistletoe!


98
00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:06.790
All right, Fredrick, you know the rules.

99
00:10:09.532 --> 00:10:10.760
Turtle!

100
00:10:12.868 --> 00:10:16.031
Both of you, lights out! 
In your bunks!

101
00:10:43.766 --> 00:10:46.997
This is your godfather, Igby.
Are you listening to me?


102
00:10:47.069 --> 00:10:51.199
This is the best thing that could have
happened to you, military school.


103
00:10:51.273 --> 00:10:55.141
To get out of that comfortable world
you were raised in. Strike out on your own.


104
00:10:55.211 --> 00:10:59.147
You know those East Coast country club
schools do you no good in the real world.


105
00:10:59.515 --> 00:11:02.177
It might be tough now,
but it's gonna make you tough.


106
00:11:02.251 --> 00:11:05.516
Unlike the rest
of your coddled contemporaries.


107
00:11:05.888 --> 00:11:06.980
Fire!

108
00:11:17.933 --> 00:11:20.595
And lgby goes down.

109
00:11:21.203 --> 00:11:23.569
I bet you've made some real buddies.

110
00:11:23.839 --> 00:11:25.466
Haven't you?

111
00:11:27.042 --> 00:11:28.669
Igby has buddies.

112
00:11:28.811 --> 00:11:30.836
-Haven't you got buddies?
-Many.


113
00:11:30.913 --> 00:11:33.643
You have that buddy
with the cute little name.


114
00:11:33.716 --> 00:11:37.413
-That little buddy, Tortoise.
-Turtle.


115
00:11:38.654 --> 00:11:39.882
Turtle?

116
00:11:40.089 --> 00:11:41.147
Turtle.

117
00:11:41.223 --> 00:11:42.485
He was my best buddy.

118
00:11:42.625 --> 00:11:45.287
Then his rifle backfired
and blew his face off.


119
00:11:45.494 --> 00:11:48.429
We all learned a lesson
about weapon maintenance that day.


120
00:11:48.497 --> 00:11:50.089
Why didn't the school inform me?

121
00:11:50.166 --> 00:11:51.758
It wasn't the school's fault.

122
00:11:52.034 --> 00:11:53.501
They were great about it.

123
00:11:53.569 --> 00:11:55.696
Paid for the dry-cleaning and everything.

124
00:11:55.771 --> 00:11:57.261
Not because they had to...

125
00:11:57.339 --> 00:12:00.502
...but because it was
the right thing to do.

126
00:12:01.944 --> 00:12:06.108
I believe that certain people in life
are meant to fall by the wayside...


127
00:12:06.382 --> 00:12:09.977
...to serve as warnings for the rest of us.
Signposts along the way.


128
00:12:10.052 --> 00:12:11.076
To where?

129
00:12:13.522 --> 00:12:14.750
Success.

130
00:12:16.325 --> 00:12:20.352
Our father would be a "slippery when
schizophrenic" sign, for instance.


131
00:12:22.565 --> 00:12:24.499
Along the highway of life.

132
00:12:27.169 --> 00:12:28.659
This summer...

133
00:12:29.138 --> 00:12:31.299
...I want you to
come and work for me.

134
00:12:32.107 --> 00:12:35.804
Work with my crew.
Renovate some of my New York properties.


135
00:12:36.946 --> 00:12:39.710
You up to bein' exploited
by your old pal this summer?


136
00:12:43.953 --> 00:12:47.252
-What do you say?
-Stay at your Hamptons summer house?


137
00:12:47.423 --> 00:12:50.119
-On the weekends.
-I'm your man, sir.


138
00:12:50.259 --> 00:12:51.624
Good!

139
00:12:53.295 --> 00:12:56.958
-When are you headed back to the academy?
-0700 tomorrow morning, sir.


140
00:13:26.462 --> 00:13:27.622
Sorry.

141
00:13:39.108 --> 00:13:43.977
"This letter is to inform you,
the recipient, that my son...


142
00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:46.505
"...the bearer of this letter...

143
00:13:46.582 --> 00:13:50.609
-"...has permission to use my credit card--"
-You can take your break now, Kevin.


144
00:13:50.686 --> 00:13:51.744
Thank you.

145
00:13:51.887 --> 00:13:54.549
-May I help you, son?
-I need a room.


146
00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:56.417
And you have a reservation?

147
00:13:57.026 --> 00:13:59.620
-I assume my mother made one.
-Under her name?


148
00:14:02.598 --> 00:14:04.725
-This is your mother?
-Yep.


149
00:14:08.270 --> 00:14:11.103
No reservation under that name.

150
00:14:11.407 --> 00:14:12.601
That is so typical.

151
00:14:12.675 --> 00:14:15.803
-ln town looking at schools, are you?
-Colleges.


152
00:14:16.078 --> 00:14:20.105
She had to fly home. I have a brother,
a teenager. Bit of a problem.


153
00:14:20.482 --> 00:14:22.143
Every family has one.

154
00:14:23.052 --> 00:14:25.350
What colleges are you lookin' at, son?

155
00:14:25.554 --> 00:14:27.021
All of 'em, really.

156
00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:31.016
Just so long as it's here.
Here in the Midwest.


157
00:14:31.627 --> 00:14:33.219
I hear ya.

158
00:14:36.598 --> 00:14:39.192
Hello, is Georgie there? He isn't?

159
00:14:39.301 --> 00:14:43.499
This is Mr. Slocumb,
Georgie's favorite teacher from the academy.


160
00:14:44.206 --> 00:14:45.605
Who are you?

161
00:14:46.141 --> 00:14:48.803
Really? I didn't know Georgie had a sister.

162
00:14:49.078 --> 00:14:51.376
I'm in town for a little while...

163
00:14:51.447 --> 00:14:53.813
...at the O'Hare Hilton.

164
00:14:55.484 --> 00:14:58.317
Listen, what are you up to?

165
00:15:01.156 --> 00:15:04.216
But I'm an incredibly cool
and young teacher.


166
00:15:05.928 --> 00:15:07.896
Why? How old are you?

167
00:15:10.065 --> 00:15:11.191
Really?

168
00:15:11.967 --> 00:15:13.559
You sound older than 11.

169
00:15:15.237 --> 00:15:17.296
You're right. It's probably the cigarettes.

170
00:15:19.775 --> 00:15:20.935
Hello?

171
00:15:21.076 --> 00:15:22.338
Mimi Slocumb, please.

172
00:15:22.411 --> 00:15:23.708
This is she.

173
00:15:23.779 --> 00:15:25.542
I'm calling from the O'Hare Hilton.

174
00:15:45.167 --> 00:15:46.498
Hi.

175
00:15:47.836 --> 00:15:50.168
You can stand at attention there, Slocumb.

176
00:15:56.779 --> 00:16:01.113
What exactly
do you think you're doing here?


177
00:16:02.851 --> 00:16:04.910
The Ritz
-Carlton was full.

178
00:16:06.088 --> 00:16:10.752
You know I'm very tense these days,
very anxious about all of lgby's trouble.


179
00:16:10.826 --> 00:16:15.525
My son in drug camp, for God's sake,
and then you make me so very cross.


180
00:16:15.597 --> 00:16:19.761
And I take the trouble to tell you
specifically what I require...


181
00:16:19.835 --> 00:16:21.769
-...a half a grapefruit and--
-Mimi.


182
00:16:21.837 --> 00:16:23.099
Let's....

183
00:16:24.173 --> 00:16:25.663
Let's get off the maid.

184
00:16:25.741 --> 00:16:26.901
Help!

185
00:16:27.576 --> 00:16:30.943
Super Cadet
has got this big smile on his face.


186
00:16:31.113 --> 00:16:32.876
No one takes him seriously.

187
00:16:33.348 --> 00:16:36.010
No one knows
that he's been expelled that morning.


188
00:16:37.019 --> 00:16:38.281
They scream...

189
00:16:38.454 --> 00:16:41.048
..."jump," and surprise...

190
00:16:41.123 --> 00:16:43.455
...he does a swan dive onto the pavement.

191
00:16:44.059 --> 00:16:48.052
You can still see the stain in the pavement
where his head popped open.


192
00:16:49.164 --> 00:16:53.498
Every morning, I used that blotch to know
where to line up for breakfast formation.


193
00:16:54.269 --> 00:16:56.396
Do you contemplate suicide?

194
00:16:56.705 --> 00:16:57.865
Constantly.

195
00:16:58.073 --> 00:17:00.598
You totally missed the point of my story.

196
00:17:00.676 --> 00:17:02.473
-Have l?
-Completely.


197
00:17:02.544 --> 00:17:06.173
It's about the hypocrisy of the place,
which I couldn't tolerate.


198
00:17:06.248 --> 00:17:09.183
You let me do my
job, and you do yours.

199
00:17:09.251 --> 00:17:10.843
I'm trying to fucking help you.

200
00:17:10.919 --> 00:17:12.750
-You think I need help?
-Apparently.


201
00:17:12.821 --> 00:17:16.222
You think that I don't know
how to do my job?


202
00:17:16.291 --> 00:17:20.284
No offense, but how good could you be,
working at this place?


203
00:17:20.362 --> 00:17:24.093
You know, I can only be as effective
as you allow me to be.


204
00:17:24.166 --> 00:17:26.100
Just tried to help you with my story.

205
00:17:26.168 --> 00:17:28.796
How did you feel
about what the boy did?

206
00:17:28.871 --> 00:17:33.831
I feel like he should've really reconsidered
his fucking options, don't you?


207
00:17:33.909 --> 00:17:36.434
-What are your options?
-I don't know yet.


208
00:17:36.812 --> 00:17:39.042
Who were you trying
to hurt with the pills?

209
00:17:39.114 --> 00:17:43.574
Nobody. I was improvising as I went.
I actually didn't give it a lot of thought.


210
00:17:43.652 --> 00:17:47.383
I think that you are much more aware
than even you realize.


211
00:17:47.523 --> 00:17:50.981
Yeah? Well, you're an idiot, so--

212
00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:53.584
What the fuck are you doing?

213
00:17:53.662 --> 00:17:55.323
I don't like being called an idiot.

214
00:17:55.397 --> 00:17:57.763
You prick! You can't fucking hit me!

215
00:18:00.836 --> 00:18:04.203
Next fall, you'll be starting
at yet another school.


216
00:18:04.373 --> 00:18:06.967
Are you gonna try to make an effort
this time around?


217
00:18:12.214 --> 00:18:14.307
I'm considering my options.

218
00:18:16.185 --> 00:18:20.645
Am I to understand you have four separate
doctors, all writing you prescriptions?


219
00:18:20.756 --> 00:18:21.916
It's a point of convenience.

220
00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:24.584
With no knowledge
of what the others are prescribing!


221
00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:26.787
My dear man, I assure you,
I need my peppies.


222
00:18:26.862 --> 00:18:29.990
Perhaps if you cut down on the Valium
and the sleeping pills...


223
00:18:30.065 --> 00:18:33.091
-...you'd have more energy.
-Without them I get very tense.


224
00:18:33.168 --> 00:18:36.501
You get tense
because you pop speed like candy.


225
00:18:36.772 --> 00:18:40.799
-Bad Mrs. Slocumb.
-I beg your pardon.


226
00:18:40.876 --> 00:18:44.937
Patients actually tolerate
this cheeky-little-shit routine of yours?


227
00:18:45.013 --> 00:18:46.742
Find it cute, do they?

228
00:18:47.149 --> 00:18:49.117
-Mrs. Slocumb--
-Out!


229
00:18:57.726 --> 00:19:00.126
-I'm not well.
-You mean literally?


230
00:19:00.195 --> 00:19:02.390
Yes, literally. 
They've run tests.

231
00:19:04.099 --> 00:19:05.623
This doesn't seem so bad.

232
00:19:05.701 --> 00:19:09.228
As nice a place as any to spend the spring.
Round out your rough edges.


233
00:19:09.304 --> 00:19:10.601
This'll do for ya.

234
00:19:10.672 --> 00:19:14.335
I still want you
to come and work for me this summer.


235
00:19:14.576 --> 00:19:17.602
Stay with Bunny and me
at the summer house. What do you think?


236
00:19:17.846 --> 00:19:21.043
Now, listen, the reason that Mimi...

237
00:19:21.416 --> 00:19:24.078
...your mother, hasn't been able to...

238
00:19:24.519 --> 00:19:27.545
...visit you.... I'm sure she wanted to.
She went to the...


239
00:19:27.623 --> 00:19:31.787
...hospital for a bit of a rest,
and they discovered something else.


240
00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:34.556
Something rather bad.

241
00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:38.794
She's getting treatment for it. Everybody's
damn confident she'll be fine, but....


242
00:19:39.334 --> 00:19:41.393
You know what mastectomy is?

243
00:19:44.673 --> 00:19:45.867
Your house....

244
00:19:46.208 --> 00:19:47.675
It's on the beach, right?

245
00:19:49.278 --> 00:19:50.540
Contract.

246
00:19:51.647 --> 00:19:54.741
It's a contract. See,
families should be run like companies...


247
00:19:54.816 --> 00:19:58.308
...with everybody's responsibilities
clearly defined.


248
00:19:58.387 --> 00:20:00.412
Children, at the age of reason...

249
00:20:00.489 --> 00:20:04.323
...should be provided with legal
representation and a contract drawn up.


250
00:20:05.027 --> 00:20:07.495
All the best relationships
are based on contracts.


251
00:20:07.562 --> 00:20:09.792
Bunny and I have a contract.

252
00:20:09.865 --> 00:20:12.129
Now that you're gonna come
and work for me...


253
00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:13.861
...we're gonna have one.

254
00:20:14.236 --> 00:20:17.933
And that piece of
paper is your clean slate.

255
00:20:24.513 --> 00:20:27.380
You know, you could just
take a later shuttle back to DC.


256
00:20:27.449 --> 00:20:29.679
I'm past the worst of it, I think.

257
00:20:30.919 --> 00:20:34.946
I'm meeting that dean
from St. Anthony's, McKaye...


258
00:20:35.357 --> 00:20:38.986
...in the morning,
to beg him to admit your brother this fall.


259
00:20:39.194 --> 00:20:41.253
A mother's work is never done.

260
00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:43.958
-D.H. is collecting lgby today?
-Yeah.


261
00:20:44.433 --> 00:20:46.799
He's picking him up from "the camp."

262
00:20:46.868 --> 00:20:50.531
What a great investment
that has proven to be.


263
00:20:52.507 --> 00:20:55.874
Getting to hear, for two months,
on a weekly basis...


264
00:20:55.944 --> 00:20:57.969
...just how much my son hates me.

265
00:20:58.046 --> 00:21:01.015
That's always been
one of his favorite topics of conversation.


266
00:21:01.083 --> 00:21:05.247
His creation was an act of animosity.
Why shouldn't his life be one?


267
00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:16.259
Listen, Ollie, this summer, lgby's going to
bunk with you at Columbia during the week.


268
00:21:16.331 --> 00:21:18.561
You both can go to the Hamptons
on the weekends.


269
00:21:18.633 --> 00:21:20.157
Of course.

270
00:21:20.736 --> 00:21:23.102
I'll baby-sit lgby all summer long.

271
00:21:23.171 --> 00:21:26.368
You know, you have been
a very bad older brother.


272
00:21:29.611 --> 00:21:31.511
And yet you're the one he hates.

273
00:21:33.382 --> 00:21:37.011
Basically, it's like reverse Darwinism.

274
00:21:37.085 --> 00:21:41.021
A situation in which
a less evolved species...


275
00:21:41.089 --> 00:21:44.991
...is better equipped to survive
than a more evolved creature.


276
00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:50.229
Which, if you think about it,
isn't really reverse Darwinism, so much as...


277
00:21:50.298 --> 00:21:52.562
...bigger-picture Darwinism, if you will.

278
00:21:53.769 --> 00:21:54.861
What?

279
00:22:06.381 --> 00:22:07.905
-Tommy?
-Yeah.


280
00:22:07.983 --> 00:22:11.043
What's happening?
Did you hear that? We were out there for....


281
00:22:11.119 --> 00:22:14.611
-What are you doing?
-Nothing.


282
00:22:14.689 --> 00:22:17.487
Did you hear the locks? 
It needs oil...

283
00:22:17.559 --> 00:22:19.390
-...or something.
-I'll fix that.


284
00:22:19.461 --> 00:22:23.830
Look at this guy. Look at this strapping
young working hunk of manhood.


285
00:22:23.899 --> 00:22:26.060
That's my godson, lgby.

286
00:22:26.902 --> 00:22:28.529
Ever hear that name, "lgby"?

287
00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:32.062
It's funny. You met his brother
at the office the other day.


288
00:22:33.842 --> 00:22:35.104
How you doin'?

289
00:22:35.177 --> 00:22:36.371
Good.

290
00:22:41.416 --> 00:22:42.883
How you doin'?

291
00:22:43.351 --> 00:22:45.546
You're doin' "well."

292
00:22:51.293 --> 00:22:54.023
How's the work comin' along there, stud?

293
00:22:55.363 --> 00:22:57.456
-Well?
-Do we need this wall?


294
00:22:58.033 --> 00:23:00.263
Three thousand square feet over!

295
00:23:01.169 --> 00:23:05.606
You got the new plumbing.
What do you call, risers, so we have very....


296
00:23:05.674 --> 00:23:07.471
We've got 27 windows.

297
00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:11.444
What are you doing, you little reptile?

298
00:23:12.914 --> 00:23:13.903
Look at this.

299
00:23:30.332 --> 00:23:32.493
Hi, honey!

300
00:24:19.247 --> 00:24:20.942
It's not that cold out here.

301
00:24:21.616 --> 00:24:22.844
No.

302
00:24:24.019 --> 00:24:25.281
Who are you?

303
00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:26.646
Sookie.

304
00:24:26.721 --> 00:24:29.189
-Sookie?
-Sookie Sapperstein.


305
00:24:29.257 --> 00:24:30.383
Yeah?

306
00:24:31.059 --> 00:24:32.151
Yeah.

307
00:24:35.730 --> 00:24:37.857
Are you somebody's daughter?

308
00:24:38.033 --> 00:24:39.660
I'm somebody's daughter.

309
00:24:39.734 --> 00:24:41.599
I mean somebody here at this party.

310
00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:43.528
No.

311
00:24:43.939 --> 00:24:45.429
Then why are you here?

312
00:24:46.675 --> 00:24:48.370
I'm with the catering company.

313
00:24:48.843 --> 00:24:50.310
The woman hired us for the party.

314
00:24:50.378 --> 00:24:52.642
Why do you think I'm dressed
like a figure skater?


315
00:24:54.849 --> 00:24:56.476
Bunny hired you.

316
00:24:56.985 --> 00:24:58.475
She's my godmother.

317
00:25:00.689 --> 00:25:03.783
Actually, she's not.
Her husband, D.H. Banes...


318
00:25:04.159 --> 00:25:05.626
...he's my godfather.

319
00:25:06.194 --> 00:25:07.855
Are those cloves?

320
00:25:09.030 --> 00:25:11.123
Outstanding! Can I bum one?

321
00:25:15.170 --> 00:25:16.194
No.

322
00:25:20.575 --> 00:25:21.974
Got a light?

323
00:25:25.113 --> 00:25:26.478
And a cigarette?

324
00:25:35.323 --> 00:25:38.451
Rachel, I see you've met the boys.

325
00:25:38.727 --> 00:25:39.853
We've already met.

326
00:25:39.928 --> 00:25:42.829
Bunny, Rachel is the choreographer
I was telling you about...


327
00:25:42.897 --> 00:25:47.493
...who's renting that commercial space
from us down in SoHo, using it as a studio.


328
00:25:47.569 --> 00:25:49.560
-Remember?
-How wonderful.


329
00:25:50.772 --> 00:25:52.239
Boys....

330
00:25:55.210 --> 00:25:58.202
It's so wonderful you could come and stay.

331
00:25:58.847 --> 00:26:02.214
-lgby, I could just eat you with a spoon.
-Don't.


332
00:26:04.419 --> 00:26:07.479
-Now, when did you get out of camp?
-Two months ago.


333
00:26:07.555 --> 00:26:11.116
I've been working for D.H. all summer.
That's why I'm here every weekend.


334
00:26:11.192 --> 00:26:14.684
My wife is the philanthropist of the family.

335
00:26:14.763 --> 00:26:16.924
Especially fond of dance, aren't you dear?

336
00:26:16.998 --> 00:26:19.466
D.H., look. Pull around.

337
00:26:19.868 --> 00:26:20.926
Here we go.

338
00:26:21.002 --> 00:26:25.769
-We have guests behind us.
-The guests. I see.


339
00:26:27.008 --> 00:26:30.171
Are you two in school or something?

340
00:26:30.512 --> 00:26:33.777
I'm at Columbia,
and as far as this year's challenge for lgby...


341
00:26:33.848 --> 00:26:37.579
...we're still waiting to hear back
from this fun parochial school in DC.


342
00:26:37.652 --> 00:26:40.621
-"Perchance to dream."
-He's done the Protestant circuit.


343
00:26:40.689 --> 00:26:44.352
Mom must have some photos of the
head priest with an altar boy for them...


344
00:26:44.426 --> 00:26:46.121
...to even be considering lgby.

345
00:26:46.461 --> 00:26:51.489
-We're all at a bit of a loss as to--
-Whenever I'm at a loss, I dip into Rilke.


346
00:26:53.268 --> 00:26:56.237
Rilke? That tortures me.

347
00:26:56.571 --> 00:27:00.063
Every Christmas, some asshole
gives me this copy of Young Poet...


348
00:27:00.141 --> 00:27:04.373
...with this patronizing note on the flap
about how it's supposed to change my life.


349
00:27:04.446 --> 00:27:08.007
-Maybe you should read it before judging it.
-I'm pretty confident.


350
00:27:08.083 --> 00:27:10.313
After all, one of
the copies was from you.

351
00:27:10.585 --> 00:27:13.554
I'm Oliver, and this
is my little brother, lgby.

352
00:27:13.621 --> 00:27:15.316
What kind of a name is "lgby"?

353
00:27:15.457 --> 00:27:19.416
It's the kind of a name that someone
named Sookie is in no position to question.


354
00:27:19.494 --> 00:27:20.552
Sookie?

355
00:27:20.795 --> 00:27:23.229
-Where do you go to school?
-Bennington.


356
00:27:23.298 --> 00:27:25.493
Ollie's majoring in Neo-Fascism
at Columbia.


357
00:27:25.567 --> 00:27:27.330
-Economics.
-Semantics.


358
00:27:27.502 --> 00:27:29.663
-What's your major?
-Attitude.


359
00:27:30.538 --> 00:27:33.405
-I've gotta get back to the bar.
-That's where I'm headed.


360
00:27:33.475 --> 00:27:35.466
Catch you kids later.

361
00:27:40.582 --> 00:27:42.049
D.H. brings you up a lot.

362
00:27:42.117 --> 00:27:44.108
-Captain Charisma is my godfather.
-I know.


363
00:27:44.185 --> 00:27:47.154
So, if something horrible, God forbid...

364
00:27:47.222 --> 00:27:50.316
...were to befall my mother,
I would live with him and Bunny.


365
00:27:50.391 --> 00:27:53.758
-I know what godparents are.
-You're ripping apart my potential home.


366
00:27:53.828 --> 00:27:57.559
-My being here offends you?
-Your being here is great.


367
00:27:58.266 --> 00:28:01.235
-I had no choice.
-No, really. I think you're great.


368
00:28:01.302 --> 00:28:02.291
Thank you.

369
00:28:02.537 --> 00:28:05.005
It's him bringing you here that tortures me.

370
00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:09.233
I love the fact that the captain
of the morality team invites his chick...


371
00:28:09.310 --> 00:28:13.838
...to the same party as his wife, who isn't
the sharpest tool in the shed anymore.


372
00:28:13.915 --> 00:28:18.284
And what's more, none of their supposed
mutual friends protects her.


373
00:28:18.386 --> 00:28:22.880
None of them bats a fucking eyelash
at his hypocrisy. I love that, I really do.


374
00:28:22.957 --> 00:28:26.290
Embrace your moral hypocrisy,
D.H. Go for it.


375
00:28:30.565 --> 00:28:32.965
-But me you're okay with.
-Honestly.


376
00:28:33.301 --> 00:28:34.768
Listen, you know what?

377
00:28:35.036 --> 00:28:38.563
If you're ever in the city,
you should pop by the loft.


378
00:28:39.174 --> 00:28:40.971
We're done working on it.

379
00:28:43.178 --> 00:28:44.167
I know.

380
00:29:08.970 --> 00:29:12.406
No worries, Mother.
Igby is on his way to the airport.


381
00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:15.734
The driver's been briefed
to take him directly to LaGuardia.


382
00:29:15.810 --> 00:29:18.904
He'll be in St. Anthony's loving custody
by this afternoon.


383
00:29:19.514 --> 00:29:22.449
And happy birthday, Mother.

384
00:29:23.151 --> 00:29:24.448
Much love.

385
00:29:24.886 --> 00:29:25.978
Sir?

386
00:29:26.321 --> 00:29:29.381
It's my mother's birthday today, and I forgot.

387
00:29:30.491 --> 00:29:32.482
Is there any way that...

388
00:29:32.727 --> 00:29:34.160
...we could just...

389
00:29:34.229 --> 00:29:36.993
...make a quick stop
in the city somewhere, so...


390
00:29:37.198 --> 00:29:38.859
...I can get her something?

391
00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:40.831
She'd be so surprised.

392
00:30:05.326 --> 00:30:06.759
Can I help you?

393
00:30:07.295 --> 00:30:08.387
Hey.

394
00:30:08.730 --> 00:30:12.257
You remember me?
From the Hamptons John Birch Cotillion.


395
00:30:13.835 --> 00:30:16.201
Yeah. How you doin'?

396
00:30:16.871 --> 00:30:18.270
Come on in.

397
00:30:18.773 --> 00:30:22.106
So, you said you'd come by and you did.
A month later.


398
00:30:22.176 --> 00:30:27.113
-Love what you've done with the space.
-I love what the space has done to her.


399
00:30:27.815 --> 00:30:30.249
-lgby.
-This is my friend, Russel.


400
00:30:30.318 --> 00:30:31.580
-Hi.
-Hi.


401
00:30:31.819 --> 00:30:34.583
-lgby is D.H.'s....
-Godson.


402
00:30:35.256 --> 00:30:37.486
-Russel's just--
-What?


403
00:30:39.961 --> 00:30:42.452
He's just a brilliant artist.

404
00:30:42.964 --> 00:30:45.489
So, what are you doing here?

405
00:30:45.566 --> 00:30:46.624
Celebrating.

406
00:30:47.402 --> 00:30:48.994
St. Anthony's accepted me.

407
00:30:49.971 --> 00:30:51.563
Congratulations?

408
00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:54.035
I'm on the lam.

409
00:30:54.309 --> 00:30:56.971
-You want to stay here?
-lf there's enough room.


410
00:30:57.045 --> 00:30:58.979
You can't stay here.

411
00:30:59.547 --> 00:31:02.778
I don't even live here.
I rent this space to work in. I work here.


412
00:31:02.917 --> 00:31:05.408
I pay rent.
D.H. doesn't even know you're here?


413
00:31:05.486 --> 00:31:07.010
It's kind of awkward.

414
00:31:07.255 --> 00:31:08.244
Great.

415
00:31:08.489 --> 00:31:12.152
I don't know what you're gonna do,
because there isn't an extra key...


416
00:31:12.226 --> 00:31:14.922
...and only D.H. can get them made, so....

417
00:31:20.702 --> 00:31:24.798
There's an extra key on the windowsill
in the hallway, the landing outside the door.


418
00:31:24.872 --> 00:31:27.033
But it has to be
here when D.H. needs it.

419
00:31:27.108 --> 00:31:29.440
-Why would D.H. need it?
-Fuck you!


420
00:31:29.877 --> 00:31:32.402
You can stay here for a couple days
and that's it.


421
00:31:34.148 --> 00:31:37.049
Contrary to popular belief,
D.H. is my landlord.


422
00:31:37.118 --> 00:31:40.349
I'm an established artist. I work here.
My projects are supported.


423
00:31:40.421 --> 00:31:44.585
I can't afford to fuck up my relationship
with my landlord. Do you understand?


424
00:31:44.659 --> 00:31:46.217
So, let yourself in and out...

425
00:31:46.294 --> 00:31:48.660
...with the key,
but each time he reaches for it...


426
00:31:48.730 --> 00:31:50.459
-...it's there waiting for him.
-Sure.


427
00:31:50.531 --> 00:31:53.796
I don't wanna know you're here
or see any traces of you in here.


428
00:31:53.868 --> 00:31:54.892
Gotcha.

429
00:31:54.969 --> 00:31:56.459
For a couple of days.

430
00:31:58.740 --> 00:32:00.708
I'm just gonna run to the bathroom.

431
00:32:04.645 --> 00:32:05.976
So, you're an artist?

432
00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:10.578
What kind of art?

433
00:32:10.651 --> 00:32:13.051
What do you mean, "what kind of art"?

434
00:32:13.121 --> 00:32:14.850
I mean do you paint, or what?

435
00:32:14.922 --> 00:32:18.380
I got what you meant,
but you obviously didn't get what I meant.


436
00:32:18.659 --> 00:32:22.891
An artist creates art,
regardless of what form the canvas takes.


437
00:32:22.964 --> 00:32:26.400
-So, what do you do? Paint?
-I'm a performance artist.


438
00:32:26.467 --> 00:32:28.367
So, you don't paint.

439
00:32:31.973 --> 00:32:33.941
Rachel thinks that D.
H. is going to...

440
00:32:34.008 --> 00:32:37.739
-...Ieave his wifey and set up house with her.
-Shut the fuck up, Russel!


441
00:32:37.812 --> 00:32:40.280
What do you think
the chances of that are?

442
00:32:40.348 --> 00:32:42.714
Moneybuckets, take me away!

443
00:32:45.219 --> 00:32:49.246
Could you persuade your godfather
into letting me use one of his buildings...


444
00:32:49.457 --> 00:32:50.856
...for one of my pieces?

445
00:32:50.925 --> 00:32:53.450
-What would you want to do with it?
-I don't know.


446
00:32:53.528 --> 00:32:55.496
Russel is just, like...

447
00:32:57.398 --> 00:32:59.195
...very brilliant.

448
00:33:03.538 --> 00:33:06.473
-How old are you?
-I'm 18.


449
00:33:08.176 --> 00:33:10.007
I'm very close to being 18.

450
00:33:14.615 --> 00:33:17.448
-Still no news on lgby?
-No.


451
00:33:18.052 --> 00:33:19.314
He will turn up.

452
00:33:19.587 --> 00:33:20.781
D.H. is...

453
00:33:21.089 --> 00:33:24.957
...spending more time in New York these
days than here in Georgetown, so...


454
00:33:25.426 --> 00:33:27.053
...he is bound to find him.

455
00:33:27.128 --> 00:33:30.427
You know, listen,
I just want you to know that if you should...


456
00:33:30.498 --> 00:33:32.659
...take a very bad turn...

457
00:33:34.035 --> 00:33:37.903
...death, for instance....
Not to worry about the boys.


458
00:33:37.972 --> 00:33:41.669
D.H. was so excited
about having them this summer...


459
00:33:41.742 --> 00:33:44.905
...and, you know,
if we could be surrogates...


460
00:33:44.979 --> 00:33:49.382
...and help the boys in any way,
you know that would make us very happy.


461
00:33:49.450 --> 00:33:51.941
I just want you to know that.

462
00:33:52.019 --> 00:33:55.648
Not to mention the fact that he's....
Over the years, he's invested...


463
00:33:55.723 --> 00:34:00.660
...an awful lot emotionally
and, well, financially into the boys.


464
00:34:01.596 --> 00:34:03.564
Igby's tuition and such.

465
00:34:03.631 --> 00:34:05.599
I mean, where else would you turn?

466
00:34:05.833 --> 00:34:07.300
Jason?

467
00:34:08.169 --> 00:34:09.431
Handsome.

468
00:34:09.537 --> 00:34:12.301
-Handsome, sad Jason...
-Shut up.


469
00:34:12.373 --> 00:34:15.638
...who so depleted your finances
and your options.


470
00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:18.736
I mean, the sacrifices
you've made to the boys...


471
00:34:18.813 --> 00:34:21.543
...I'm just, well, how....

472
00:34:21.616 --> 00:34:24.380
-How did you do it?
-Stirrups and a turkey baster.


473
00:34:35.596 --> 00:34:38.064
-Bunny?
-Yeah?


474
00:34:39.834 --> 00:34:41.961
You are a feeble woman.

475
00:34:55.216 --> 00:34:57.548
Did I hear Mimi?

476
00:34:58.486 --> 00:34:59.976
She's just freshening up.

477
00:35:00.154 --> 00:35:01.416
She's freshening up?

478
00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:03.482
Mimi?

479
00:35:04.358 --> 00:35:06.087
Did she leave, D.H.?

480
00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:08.658
Without saying goodbye?

481
00:35:08.796 --> 00:35:10.320
She did leave a note.

482
00:35:10.598 --> 00:35:12.429
Of course she did.

483
00:35:12.733 --> 00:35:14.030
Sweet Mimi!

484
00:35:18.206 --> 00:35:20.606
Can't you hit D.
H. up for some bucks?

485
00:35:21.809 --> 00:35:24.539
I'd ask him myself,
but I'm not having sex with him.


486
00:35:24.612 --> 00:35:27.137
-Fuck you. Get a job.
-Please!


487
00:35:27.748 --> 00:35:30.273
Things have become fragile with D.H.

488
00:35:31.886 --> 00:35:33.285
What things?

489
00:35:33.788 --> 00:35:34.812
Me.

490
00:35:35.189 --> 00:35:36.315
Russel!

491
00:35:39.293 --> 00:35:42.456
You're not even paying rent.
All you really need is pocket cash.


492
00:35:42.530 --> 00:35:43.792
I have needs.

493
00:35:43.864 --> 00:35:46.264
Russel's always looking for assistants
for projects.


494
00:35:46.334 --> 00:35:49.167
I'm sure he'd throw you work
as a favor to me. He loves me.


495
00:35:49.237 --> 00:35:51.467
Where the fuck are you?

496
00:35:51.539 --> 00:35:53.268
On one of his artworks?

497
00:35:54.709 --> 00:35:56.643
-Shit!
-Catch!


498
00:36:13.928 --> 00:36:17.762
I know you. You're that boy
from the Hamptons party.


499
00:36:19.734 --> 00:36:20.792
Iggy?

500
00:36:21.068 --> 00:36:24.265
I met you at your uncle's party.

501
00:36:24.472 --> 00:36:27.202
Igby. He's my godfather. 
Leave me alone.

502
00:36:28.309 --> 00:36:29.367
Igby.

503
00:36:29.710 --> 00:36:30.734
What?

504
00:36:30.811 --> 00:36:32.073
Dime bag.

505
00:36:35.950 --> 00:36:37.679
That got your attention.

506
00:36:37.818 --> 00:36:39.080
Pavlov's pothead.

507
00:36:39.420 --> 00:36:42.389
I hear the sound of a bong clink
and my eyes begin to water.


508
00:36:42.456 --> 00:36:43.923
That's funny.

509
00:36:45.059 --> 00:36:46.583
Thanks.

510
00:36:47.194 --> 00:36:48.422
The park?

511
00:36:48.629 --> 00:36:49.721
Yeah.

512
00:36:51.899 --> 00:36:54.595
You can't guard me, Mindy!

513
00:36:55.036 --> 00:36:57.163
C'mon, where'd it go?

514
00:36:57.505 --> 00:36:58.529
Oh, shit!

515
00:36:58.606 --> 00:37:01.234
-You bitch!
-My ball, cuntface!


516
00:37:07.014 --> 00:37:09.949
-Are you a vegetarian?
-Why would you ask that?


517
00:37:10.117 --> 00:37:13.109
I've just never seen anybody
roll a joint like that.


518
00:37:13.621 --> 00:37:15.987
What does that have to do
with being a vegetarian?


519
00:37:16.057 --> 00:37:18.025
They're just so precious.

520
00:37:19.126 --> 00:37:20.616
I roll perfect joints.

521
00:37:20.961 --> 00:37:24.089
-I'm not putting them down. They're great.
-Thank you.


522
00:37:24.165 --> 00:37:27.965
It's incredible that a human being
could make such neat little joints.


523
00:37:28.035 --> 00:37:30.230
You make it sound as if
I'm anal or something.


524
00:37:30.304 --> 00:37:33.467
-Just because I can roll a perfect joint.
-Not anal.


525
00:37:34.942 --> 00:37:35.931
Vegetarian.

526
00:37:36.010 --> 00:37:37.409
What does that mean?

527
00:37:37.478 --> 00:37:41.574
You don't roll
big Rasta spliff joints, do you?


528
00:37:41.649 --> 00:37:45.176
Your joints are like salad joints,
not like a big...


529
00:37:45.252 --> 00:37:49.689
...sloppy, bleeding-cheeseburger-
that-you-rip-into-kind-of-a-joint joint.


530
00:37:50.157 --> 00:37:55.094
I guess marijuana
isn't a visceral experience for me.


531
00:37:55.863 --> 00:37:58.127
-Sex is for me.
-Right.


532
00:38:02.970 --> 00:38:07.066
Okay, so I am a vegetarian.
But for purely moral reasons.


533
00:38:08.342 --> 00:38:11.038
I thought you went to school
at Brandeis or someplace.


534
00:38:11.112 --> 00:38:12.636
Bennington. I do.

535
00:38:12.713 --> 00:38:15.705
-Why aren't you there?
-I took a semester off.


536
00:38:16.450 --> 00:38:18.281
I needed time to recuperate.

537
00:38:18.352 --> 00:38:19.717
From what?

538
00:38:21.822 --> 00:38:25.690
Entenmann's cookies,
beer, diet pills, tension...


539
00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:27.659
...Iife.

540
00:38:27.895 --> 00:38:30.693
My dad's been recuperating for six years.

541
00:38:31.198 --> 00:38:32.825
What do you mean?

542
00:38:33.534 --> 00:38:35.525
From life. Nothing.

543
00:38:38.372 --> 00:38:39.464
Let's go.

544
00:38:42.443 --> 00:38:44.411
You've come a long way, baby.

545
00:38:47.715 --> 00:38:49.182
You're funny.

546
00:39:04.932 --> 00:39:08.299
Hello, I'm Lt. Ernest Smith
from Pershing Academy.


547
00:39:08.369 --> 00:39:11.429
-I'm here to ask about a--
-Those are fabulous.


548
00:39:11.806 --> 00:39:13.933
-Where did you get them?
-The army.


549
00:39:14.275 --> 00:39:15.572
See, I'm regular army.

550
00:39:15.743 --> 00:39:19.201
Mrs. Slocumb found out
I was stationed in New Jersey now...


551
00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:23.808
...so she just thought that maybe lgby,
since he worked here this summer....


552
00:39:24.351 --> 00:39:25.818
Can I have these?

553
00:39:28.456 --> 00:39:29.889
No.

554
00:39:31.492 --> 00:39:34.689
I'm asking about lgby Slocumb!

555
00:39:37.164 --> 00:39:41.464
Anne Frank, the soldiers are gone.
Come out and play.


556
00:39:50.744 --> 00:39:53.872
Yum, with three "M"s.

557
00:39:57.384 --> 00:40:00.080
You have a huge
crush on me, don't you?

558
00:40:00.354 --> 00:40:01.378
Fuck off.

559
00:40:02.756 --> 00:40:05.224
How's your brother doing these days?

560
00:40:05.359 --> 00:40:09.159
-I don't have a brother. I'm an only child.
-Oliver's your brother, I thought.


561
00:40:09.230 --> 00:40:11.391
-He is, and yet....
-And yet what?


562
00:40:11.465 --> 00:40:14.593
I was about to say that we were
both raised only children, but...


563
00:40:14.668 --> 00:40:17.000
...that sounds like something
you would say.


564
00:40:17.571 --> 00:40:19.095
What do you do?

565
00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:21.067
I'm preparing to leave.

566
00:40:21.342 --> 00:40:22.639
Where do you want to go?

567
00:40:23.277 --> 00:40:24.539
Far away.

568
00:40:25.246 --> 00:40:27.840
I was thinking
about joining the Peace Corps.


569
00:40:28.249 --> 00:40:30.649
Go on my Razor's Edge experience.

570
00:40:30.751 --> 00:40:32.343
Discover the meaning of life.

571
00:40:33.020 --> 00:40:34.282
Whatever.

572
00:40:34.355 --> 00:40:38.018
You need at least three years of college
to join the Peace Corps, don't you?


573
00:40:38.092 --> 00:40:39.116
You do?

574
00:40:39.426 --> 00:40:41.690
Yeah. I had a
friend at school who joined.

575
00:40:42.029 --> 00:40:43.997
That could be a slight snag.

576
00:40:44.064 --> 00:40:46.532
I haven't even gotten around
to taking my GED yet.


577
00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:49.125
-So take it.
-I gotta go to Hackensack.


578
00:40:49.303 --> 00:40:52.568
So go! Stop procrastinating.
It's almost Christmas.


579
00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:57.033
Not going to New Jersey isn't
procrastinating. It's common sense.


580
00:40:57.645 --> 00:40:59.636
-Do you want me to go with you?
-No.


581
00:40:59.980 --> 00:41:01.174
I will.

582
00:41:04.418 --> 00:41:05.908
All right, that'd be great.

583
00:41:06.053 --> 00:41:07.918
Why aren't you in school now?

584
00:41:08.055 --> 00:41:09.647
Sheer ingenuity.

585
00:41:10.791 --> 00:41:12.258
You're funny.

586
00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:16.696
Instead of saying
that someone or something is funny...


587
00:41:17.097 --> 00:41:19.122
...why don't you just laugh?

588
00:41:22.570 --> 00:41:24.333
-ls that better?
-Much.


589
00:41:26.707 --> 00:41:29.938
-Gosh, I've never been to a hideout before.
-Shut up.


590
00:41:56.770 --> 00:41:58.829
My boy...

591
00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:00.771
...you look a bit...

592
00:42:01.475 --> 00:42:03.033
...peaked.

593
00:42:03.243 --> 00:42:05.302
I don't feel peaked.

594
00:42:18.292 --> 00:42:19.486
Say...

595
00:42:19.627 --> 00:42:21.094
...give your....

596
00:42:21.161 --> 00:42:23.391
Give your mother a call.

597
00:42:24.465 --> 00:42:26.763
Let her know you're alive, yes?

598
00:42:35.242 --> 00:42:37.870
You need to eat
some red meat, my boy.

599
00:42:39.213 --> 00:42:40.805
You're all pale.

600
00:42:54.895 --> 00:42:57.420
I didn't know he was here.
The key was on the window.


601
00:42:57.498 --> 00:42:59.295
We had lunch. I let him in.

602
00:42:59.366 --> 00:43:02.267
How was I supposed to know that?
It wasn't my fault.


603
00:43:02.336 --> 00:43:05.499
-We had an agreement. You fucked up.
-lt wasn't my fault.


604
00:43:05.706 --> 00:43:07.105
You fucking idiot!

605
00:43:08.042 --> 00:43:09.373
So....

606
00:43:10.577 --> 00:43:12.772
I guess you have
to pay rent this month.

607
00:43:19.553 --> 00:43:21.111
Rachel, stop.

608
00:43:44.278 --> 00:43:45.575
She's a...

609
00:43:45.946 --> 00:43:48.312
...dancer who doesn't dance, and...

610
00:43:48.382 --> 00:43:50.976
...her friend is a painter who doesn't paint.

611
00:43:51.318 --> 00:43:54.879
It's kind of a boho version of
Island of the Lost Toys.


612
00:43:57.024 --> 00:43:59.754
And she's a lot stronger than she looks.

613
00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:55.038
I broke my butt!

614
00:45:05.125 --> 00:45:08.561
You know what I think about
when I'm this close to another body?


615
00:45:11.064 --> 00:45:12.395
I think...

616
00:45:13.534 --> 00:45:14.762
...one day...

617
00:45:15.803 --> 00:45:17.600
...at one moment...

618
00:45:18.405 --> 00:45:22.671
...this body that I'm holding in my arms
will stop breathing...


619
00:45:23.677 --> 00:45:25.338
...stop living...

620
00:45:25.879 --> 00:45:27.210
...just...

621
00:45:28.382 --> 00:45:29.474
...stop.

622
00:45:32.352 --> 00:45:37.551
One day, you'll see my name in the obits
and you'll remember this moment.


623
00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:42.087
You're a real fuckin' upper.

624
00:45:42.663 --> 00:45:45.291
How did you end up at military school?

625
00:45:45.599 --> 00:45:46.759
Mimi.

626
00:45:46.834 --> 00:45:48.699
-Mimi?
-My mother.


627
00:45:49.236 --> 00:45:51.295
You call your mother "Mimi"?

628
00:45:51.839 --> 00:45:53.670
"Heinous One" is a bit cumbersome.

629
00:45:53.740 --> 00:45:54.968
Right.

630
00:45:55.042 --> 00:45:57.010
"Medea" was already taken.

631
00:45:59.546 --> 00:46:02.276
Your mother sent you to military school?

632
00:46:03.483 --> 00:46:08.284
In all fairness to her, I did get kicked out
of most of the schools on the East Coast.


633
00:46:10.157 --> 00:46:15.117
Still, I just assumed that military school
was an empty threat, like with most parents.


634
00:46:15.929 --> 00:46:17.658
She called that bluff.

635
00:46:18.165 --> 00:46:20.895
Do you resent her for sending you there?

636
00:46:21.235 --> 00:46:22.600
I'm glad I went.

637
00:46:23.270 --> 00:46:24.965
It made everything clear to me.

638
00:46:25.772 --> 00:46:27.103
Like what?

639
00:46:28.408 --> 00:46:29.739
The fight.

640
00:46:30.010 --> 00:46:32.240
-15 minutes.
-Okay.


641
00:46:32.312 --> 00:46:35.440
Downstairs, dressed,
waiting for your father, in 15 minutes...


642
00:46:35.515 --> 00:46:36.743
...or you're taking the bus.

643
00:46:36.817 --> 00:46:37.875
I know.

644
00:46:53.734 --> 00:46:54.792
Dad?

645
00:48:31.298 --> 00:48:32.526
You see...

646
00:48:33.834 --> 00:48:34.926
...Igby...

647
00:48:36.169 --> 00:48:38.330
...I feel this...

648
00:48:38.538 --> 00:48:39.800
...great...

649
00:48:42.442 --> 00:48:43.670
...pressure...

650
00:48:45.512 --> 00:48:47.070
...coming down on me.

651
00:48:48.982 --> 00:48:53.351
It's just constantly coming down on me...

652
00:48:56.990 --> 00:48:58.389
...crushing me.

653
00:49:13.974 --> 00:49:18.775
You make it sound sinister. That's
what good schools are for, to shape you...


654
00:49:18.979 --> 00:49:22.608
...not brainwash you
in some evil, Orwellian way, or...


655
00:49:22.783 --> 00:49:25.183
...squash you
into something you're not, but....


656
00:49:26.253 --> 00:49:29.086
I know my mother
teaches metaphysical poetry at Vassar.


657
00:49:29.156 --> 00:49:30.487
I really believe she tries--

658
00:49:30.557 --> 00:49:34.550
My father went through the system and
it told him what he was supposed to want.


659
00:49:34.861 --> 00:49:36.488
He achieved everything, and...

660
00:49:36.897 --> 00:49:38.592
...then in his 40s, he flipped.

661
00:49:38.732 --> 00:49:40.893
What did he really want?

662
00:49:42.402 --> 00:49:43.767
Sunny days.

663
00:49:44.438 --> 00:49:47.703
Now Dad is in the Maryland Home
for the Befuddled.


664
00:49:48.909 --> 00:49:50.809
Cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs.

665
00:49:52.179 --> 00:49:54.704
So, you're never going back to school?

666
00:49:54.915 --> 00:49:58.646
What are you planning to do with your life,
lgby? Just kill time until--


667
00:49:58.718 --> 00:50:00.811
My nervous breakdown comes along?

668
00:50:06.359 --> 00:50:07.792
Is your father dead?

669
00:50:08.161 --> 00:50:09.958
No, why?

670
00:50:10.564 --> 00:50:15.024
'Cause when I talked about mine, you didn't
feel obligated to compare and contrast.


671
00:50:15.769 --> 00:50:17.430
He's a theologian.

672
00:50:18.171 --> 00:50:21.265
A Jewish theologian
and a metaphysical poetess.


673
00:50:22.142 --> 00:50:23.336
Doesn't explain you.

674
00:50:23.410 --> 00:50:24.843
What would?

675
00:50:25.312 --> 00:50:27.109
Cross-dressing psychoanalysts?

676
00:50:27.514 --> 00:50:28.845
Heroin junkies?

677
00:50:29.182 --> 00:50:30.945
-I don't know.
-Thanks.


678
00:50:32.619 --> 00:50:34.109
My parents...

679
00:50:34.721 --> 00:50:36.052
...were two...

680
00:50:36.123 --> 00:50:39.115
...very idealistic, incredibly bright...

681
00:50:39.693 --> 00:50:40.853
...narcissists.

682
00:50:41.761 --> 00:50:43.456
I was like their vanity project.

683
00:50:43.530 --> 00:50:45.725
-Oh, my God.
-What?


684
00:50:45.799 --> 00:50:47.323
You torture me.

685
00:50:47.834 --> 00:50:49.597
I was adopted, okay?

686
00:50:49.669 --> 00:50:51.432
That would explain everything.

687
00:50:51.972 --> 00:50:54.600
'Cause, I mean,
how many Vassar professors...


688
00:50:54.674 --> 00:50:59.304
...and intellectual theologians
beget nymphomaniacal...


689
00:50:59.379 --> 00:51:01.347
...pseudo-bohemian J.A.P.s?

690
00:51:01.848 --> 00:51:04.180
Actually, a lot, probably, right?

691
00:51:07.487 --> 00:51:08.886
I'm not a J.A.P.

692
00:51:25.772 --> 00:51:28.764
-Good morning. I'm Oliver. We met at the--
-Right.


693
00:51:28.842 --> 00:51:31.777
At that party in the Hamptons.

694
00:51:32.045 --> 00:51:35.674
-You're the fascist brother.
-He prefers "Young Republican."


695
00:51:40.353 --> 00:51:41.980
I'm Sookie.

696
00:51:42.589 --> 00:51:44.648
Excuse me. I've got to....

697
00:51:44.724 --> 00:51:46.487
I'm sorry.

698
00:51:51.665 --> 00:51:54.566
-God, you're pathetic.
-Thank you, fuckwit.


699
00:51:55.735 --> 00:51:57.327
D.H. told you I was here?

700
00:51:57.604 --> 00:52:01.734
Your little vacation's about to
come to a rather abrupt and severe end.


701
00:52:02.576 --> 00:52:04.009
Come again?

702
00:52:04.077 --> 00:52:05.237
You're still a minor.

703
00:52:05.312 --> 00:52:06.370
So?

704
00:52:06.446 --> 00:52:09.643
Since you're not interested
in taking care of your education...


705
00:52:09.716 --> 00:52:11.707
...measures are being taken on your behalf.

706
00:52:11.785 --> 00:52:13.150
What measures?

707
00:52:13.453 --> 00:52:15.546
Mom's coming up next weekend.

708
00:52:15.922 --> 00:52:17.014
Great.

709
00:52:17.457 --> 00:52:20.756
-I'm taking my equivalency test on Friday.
-Whatever.


710
00:52:20.827 --> 00:52:22.818
I can vouch,
because I made the appointment.


711
00:52:22.896 --> 00:52:24.659
-Really?
-Really.


712
00:52:25.265 --> 00:52:27.995
Oh, my God! It's almost the afternoon.

713
00:52:29.236 --> 00:52:30.567
Look, it was...

714
00:52:31.171 --> 00:52:34.334
-...nice meeting you. I'm gonna take off.
-Where are you headed?


715
00:52:34.407 --> 00:52:36.170
My mom's. Upper East Side.

716
00:52:36.243 --> 00:52:38.939
Me, too. That's where I'm staying.

717
00:52:39.012 --> 00:52:41.105
Amidst the cobwebs and geriatrics.

718
00:52:41.181 --> 00:52:42.375
The geriatrics?

719
00:52:42.449 --> 00:52:45.782
Everyone's inferior to Ollie in some way.
Ask him, he'll tell ya.


720
00:52:45.852 --> 00:52:47.217
Let me give you a lift.

721
00:52:47.520 --> 00:52:50.580
It's a write-off for D.H.
You can't pass up a free ride.


722
00:52:52.492 --> 00:52:54.221
-Friday?
-Friday.


723
00:52:56.396 --> 00:52:57.590
See ya.

724
00:53:03.370 --> 00:53:05.463
It's not his real name.

725
00:53:05.805 --> 00:53:10.071
He had a stuffed bear as a kid, Digby Bear.
They were British, I think.


726
00:53:10.610 --> 00:53:14.205
And because he always got everything
wrong, he called it "lgby."


727
00:53:14.281 --> 00:53:18.217
Whenever he committed a crime,
he would say, "l didn't do it, lgby did."


728
00:53:18.551 --> 00:53:22.544
And to break him of this habit,
being as hip to child psych as she was...


729
00:53:22.622 --> 00:53:26.149
...Mimi started referring to him as lgby
every time he lied.


730
00:53:26.226 --> 00:53:28.524
He lied a lot.

731
00:53:31.064 --> 00:53:34.591
So, you work for your godfather?

732
00:53:34.668 --> 00:53:37.535
Igby's, D.H., who is amazing.

733
00:53:37.937 --> 00:53:40.838
His mind functions only to make money.

734
00:53:41.141 --> 00:53:43.871
He thinks he has everything
he could possibly want...


735
00:53:43.943 --> 00:53:48.175
...so he walks around acting the way he
thinks a happy and content man should act.


736
00:53:48.682 --> 00:53:49.706
He's a parody.

737
00:53:49.783 --> 00:53:54.311
-lf he's a parody, why do you work for him?
-He's an obscenely rich parody.


738
00:53:54.387 --> 00:53:57.754
And if he wants to make me
in his image, hey.


739
00:54:00.026 --> 00:54:02.017
What does your mother do?

740
00:54:02.262 --> 00:54:06.164
She's a writer,
though mostly she just teaches now.


741
00:54:06.232 --> 00:54:07.494
Is she divorced?

742
00:54:07.767 --> 00:54:08.893
Never married.

743
00:54:08.968 --> 00:54:10.993
-How come?
-Doesn't like men.


744
00:54:11.404 --> 00:54:13.304
-Lesbian.
-No.


745
00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:16.731
Just a failed heterosexual.

746
00:54:19.746 --> 00:54:22.078
Listen, thanks for the lift.

747
00:54:23.350 --> 00:54:24.510
Shit!

748
00:54:24.584 --> 00:54:27.144
What, did you lose your wallet?

749
00:54:28.154 --> 00:54:30.554
I don't have the keys
to my aunt's apartment.


750
00:54:30.623 --> 00:54:34.582
-The doorman won't let you in?
-He's totally senile, never remembers me.


751
00:54:34.661 --> 00:54:36.561
I'll just wait for her.

752
00:54:36.963 --> 00:54:38.396
Wander around.

753
00:54:38.465 --> 00:54:40.524
She'll be in this evening at some point.

754
00:54:40.600 --> 00:54:42.727
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.


755
00:54:43.436 --> 00:54:45.904
-Could I use your phone?
-Sure.


756
00:54:45.972 --> 00:54:47.667
I mean, God.

757
00:54:47.741 --> 00:54:48.799
Can I get a receipt?

758
00:54:54.647 --> 00:54:55.875
Mimi...

759
00:54:56.783 --> 00:54:59.877
...had been afraid someone
would find something embarrassing.


760
00:55:01.187 --> 00:55:03.553
So up went her little soldier...

761
00:55:03.923 --> 00:55:05.584
...while she waited downstairs.

762
00:55:06.292 --> 00:55:08.692
This old lady led me to his desk.

763
00:55:09.929 --> 00:55:14.491
And before she left me there, made sure
to give me a nice pat on the head.


764
00:55:14.667 --> 00:55:17.158
I wanted to break her fucking hand.

765
00:55:18.438 --> 00:55:22.397
So, I sat down in my father's chair
and I started looking in his desk.


766
00:55:22.709 --> 00:55:24.870
Each drawer that I opened was the same.

767
00:55:25.145 --> 00:55:27.409
No books, no pencils...

768
00:55:27.480 --> 00:55:31.644
...just row upon row
of meticulously stacked cigarettes.


769
00:55:31.951 --> 00:55:33.145
Thousands of them.

770
00:55:38.491 --> 00:55:39.981
And all I could think was...

771
00:55:40.193 --> 00:55:43.651
...not the extent to which
my father's sickness had damaged him...


772
00:55:43.830 --> 00:55:44.956
...but rather:

773
00:55:45.165 --> 00:55:46.154
"Gosh...

774
00:55:47.367 --> 00:55:51.133
"...how would somebody do this without
anyone in the office being the wiser?"


775
00:55:51.271 --> 00:55:56.265
You know, not "my father's so far fucking
gone, he ain't never comin' back..."


776
00:55:57.410 --> 00:55:58.604
...but just:

777
00:56:03.016 --> 00:56:07.146
"How the fuck
did he get all of these cigarettes...


778
00:56:09.856 --> 00:56:11.448
"...into this desk?"

779
00:56:14.027 --> 00:56:15.517
You were numb.

780
00:56:20.667 --> 00:56:22.157
Sookie...

781
00:56:22.669 --> 00:56:23.897
...I am numb.

782
00:58:11.578 --> 00:58:14.945
-Everything all right here, folks? You okay?
-Great.


783
00:58:15.448 --> 00:58:17.712
Excuse me! I'm sorry.

784
00:58:55.788 --> 00:58:58.757
Do you want me to give this to you
or should I hang on to it?


785
00:58:58.825 --> 00:59:01.794
I want you to pin it to my lapel
with my mittens and nametag.


786
00:59:01.861 --> 00:59:05.558
-Snippy. No bus-ride treat for you.
-Shut up!


787
00:59:06.699 --> 00:59:09.031
You're being really immature about this.

788
00:59:09.268 --> 00:59:13.568
If I'm immature, you're prenatal.
God, to be impressed by that preppy prick.


789
00:59:13.640 --> 00:59:16.131
We hung out. We're closer in age.

790
00:59:16.209 --> 00:59:18.575
He's your brother.
You act like you hate him.


791
00:59:18.778 --> 00:59:20.006
I do!

792
00:59:20.213 --> 00:59:22.738
I do hate him. 
He's totally hateable.

793
00:59:24.484 --> 00:59:26.543
Evil, niblet fuck.

794
00:59:32.291 --> 00:59:36.159
There's been a misunderstanding.
Next fall is not good.


795
00:59:36.229 --> 00:59:39.596
I need my son enrolled this spring.

796
00:59:40.733 --> 00:59:44.260
Have you spoken to his godfather,
D.H. Banes?


797
00:59:44.771 --> 00:59:47.638
Igby is his favorite charity.

798
00:59:47.707 --> 00:59:50.642
He's sponsoring the boy, as in, financially.

799
00:59:51.878 --> 00:59:57.248
What do we have to do, then,
to make it happen this spring?


800
00:59:58.551 --> 00:59:59.848
You do that.

801
01:00:00.119 --> 01:00:01.916
Thank you very much.

802
01:00:02.355 --> 01:00:03.549
Bye-bye.

803
01:00:09.495 --> 01:00:12.794
I'm goin' to California.
I need a fuckin' sunny day.


804
01:00:13.366 --> 01:00:14.697
Can I come?

805
01:00:15.068 --> 01:00:16.399
I'm serious.

806
01:00:16.936 --> 01:00:18.767
There's nothing keeping me here.

807
01:00:19.105 --> 01:00:20.470
Except perhaps poverty.

808
01:00:20.540 --> 01:00:23.270
-Can't let that stop you.
-I can't.


809
01:00:23.943 --> 01:00:26.605
I've always wanted
to drive across the country.


810
01:00:26.846 --> 01:00:29.406
-Maybe this summer.
-Fuck that. I'm flying.


811
01:00:29.615 --> 01:00:32.106
-I wanna come, asshole.
-Good.


812
01:00:33.786 --> 01:00:36.380
'Cause I'd be afraid to go by myself.

813
01:00:54.574 --> 01:00:58.101
-May I freshen your drink?
-A little baby portion, please.


814
01:01:00.780 --> 01:01:02.179
Bigger baby.

815
01:01:07.053 --> 01:01:08.384
Thank you.

816
01:01:15.061 --> 01:01:16.926
I must say...

817
01:01:17.096 --> 01:01:19.428
...you have perfected the hobo look.

818
01:01:20.199 --> 01:01:23.794
You didn't buy the suit, did you?
Someone left it someplace for you?


819
01:01:23.870 --> 01:01:24.962
Dad.

820
01:01:25.271 --> 01:01:26.465
How apropos.

821
01:01:30.610 --> 01:01:31.838
I want my money.

822
01:01:32.111 --> 01:01:33.237
My money from Dad.

823
01:01:33.312 --> 01:01:35.007
I'll get it in two years, anyway.

824
01:01:35.081 --> 01:01:38.608
-So you can extend your vacation?
-I need it.


825
01:01:38.985 --> 01:01:40.680
You freed it up early for Ollie.

826
01:01:41.854 --> 01:01:45.312
Ollie graduated from high school.
He graduated at the top of his class.


827
01:01:45.391 --> 01:01:48.417
He earned it.
I'm not gonna subsidize your being a bum.


828
01:01:48.494 --> 01:01:50.553
-It's a moot point, anyhow.
-What do you mean?


829
01:01:50.630 --> 01:01:54.726
You're assuming Jason provided for you
in the same manner he provided for Ollie.


830
01:01:54.801 --> 01:01:55.825
Yes.

831
01:01:55.902 --> 01:01:56.994
He didn't.

832
01:01:57.904 --> 01:01:59.371
You're lying.

833
01:02:00.540 --> 01:02:01.700
Darling...

834
01:02:02.141 --> 01:02:04.541
...why would I lie when
I can just say "no"?

835
01:02:08.181 --> 01:02:11.275
I've had a conversation with Mr. McKaye...

836
01:02:11.350 --> 01:02:16.287
...headmaster of St. Anthony's, and in spite
of your little disappearing act this fall...


837
01:02:17.089 --> 01:02:21.253
...he has agreed to admit you
after Christmas.


838
01:02:21.327 --> 01:02:23.693
-You'll be boarding there--
-I'm not going back.


839
01:02:23.763 --> 01:02:26.698
I passed the equivalency test.
I don't have to go back.


840
01:02:26.966 --> 01:02:31.926
Of course, I don't trust you with the train
fare, so if you just look up Ollie...


841
01:02:32.171 --> 01:02:35.231
...tell him that I will reimburse him
if he buys your ticket.


842
01:02:35.308 --> 01:02:37.208
-I don't have his number.
-D.H. does.


843
01:02:39.111 --> 01:02:41.636
If it had just occurred to me
to mention it to Ollie.


844
01:02:41.714 --> 01:02:44.547
I saw him this afternoon,
for lunch, with his girlfriend.


845
01:02:44.617 --> 01:02:47.142
In fact, you just missed him,
darling, by about...


846
01:02:47.253 --> 01:02:49.050
...an hour and a half.

847
01:02:50.122 --> 01:02:51.589
His Connecticut one?

848
01:02:53.292 --> 01:02:58.127
Though I rather liked her. This is a new
one, a rather attractive New York girl, a...


849
01:02:58.731 --> 01:03:00.130
...Jewish girl.

850
01:03:09.876 --> 01:03:14.472
You've reached my studio. If you want to
rent, leave your information after the beep.


851
01:03:14.547 --> 01:03:16.344
Otherwise, you know what to do.

852
01:03:17.483 --> 01:03:20.350
Honey? I hope I caught you.

853
01:03:20.419 --> 01:03:23.752
Guess where I am. St. 
Vincent's Hospital.

854
01:03:24.557 --> 01:03:26.024
We're having a party.

855
01:03:26.092 --> 01:03:29.118
Everybody is here, just fucking everybody.

856
01:03:29.762 --> 01:03:31.059
It's a party.

857
01:03:31.597 --> 01:03:34.395
A bad batch Mama sold you.

858
01:03:34.700 --> 01:03:37.032
But I caught you in time, right?

859
01:03:37.870 --> 01:03:40.236
You're not coming to this party, right?

860
01:03:45.111 --> 01:03:47.079
Hello, Bunny? It's Igby.

861
01:03:47.313 --> 01:03:51.147
I'm in New York. Listen, is D.H. there?

862
01:03:51.517 --> 01:03:56.250
Thank you. She was by my place,
literally, seconds ago.


863
01:03:56.589 --> 01:03:59.524
She must've used in the cab
on the way home.


864
01:04:00.026 --> 01:04:03.018
My God, what's that about, right?

865
01:04:03.696 --> 01:04:06.426
A little patience, girl, huh?

866
01:04:06.999 --> 01:04:10.526
Hi. The doctor said
that she's gonna be fine.


867
01:04:11.437 --> 01:04:13.098
Out tomorrow maybe.

868
01:04:13.172 --> 01:04:15.697
Everything's taken care of.
Nothing more to do here.


869
01:04:15.908 --> 01:04:19.435
I'm Rachel's friend, Russel.

870
01:04:21.547 --> 01:04:22.571
Hi.

871
01:04:23.950 --> 01:04:26.544
Need a lift? Headed back to the loft?

872
01:04:27.219 --> 01:04:30.279
-Yeah. Thanks, D.H.
-Please.


873
01:04:33.726 --> 01:04:36.490
I'm sorry I called like that.
I didn't know what else to do.


874
01:04:36.562 --> 01:04:39.292
You did the right thing.
I'm glad we were on the island.


875
01:04:39.365 --> 01:04:40.662
Good boy.

876
01:04:40.900 --> 01:04:42.731
Very good boy.

877
01:04:52.745 --> 01:04:57.682
You know, I was the best man at your
parents' wedding. Did you know that, lgby?


878
01:04:58.050 --> 01:05:01.918
The golden couple.
That's what the paper called it.


879
01:05:02.488 --> 01:05:04.285
My boy.

880
01:05:07.727 --> 01:05:11.128
You know what I think you've been up to?
I think you've been pissing...


881
01:05:11.197 --> 01:05:13.290
...in the well from which you drink.

882
01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.332
That's what I think you've been up to.

883
01:05:41.527 --> 01:05:43.017
What happened?

884
01:05:44.530 --> 01:05:45.861
Breach of contract.

885
01:05:46.298 --> 01:05:47.856
D.H. did this to you?

886
01:05:48.768 --> 01:05:51.896
-I didn't know he could get angry.
-He wasn't angry.


887
01:05:51.971 --> 01:05:53.632
He felt obligated.

888
01:05:54.974 --> 01:05:58.501
Not to worry. I doubt it will affect
your position as his prime punk.


889
01:05:58.911 --> 01:06:03.075
I think if Gandhi had had to hang out
with you for any prolonged period of time...


890
01:06:03.149 --> 01:06:05.617
...he'd have ended up
kicking the shit out of you.


891
01:06:06.385 --> 01:06:07.818
Fuckwit.

892
01:06:08.154 --> 01:06:09.644
Why?

893
01:06:09.822 --> 01:06:11.016
Rachel.

894
01:06:12.558 --> 01:06:14.048
You're screwing Rachel?

895
01:06:14.193 --> 01:06:15.785
You're screwing Rachel?

896
01:06:15.861 --> 01:06:18.056
Where was Rachel
when all this was going on?


897
01:06:19.031 --> 01:06:20.225
OD'd.

898
01:06:22.168 --> 01:06:23.931
Is she dead?

899
01:06:24.904 --> 01:06:26.496
St. Vincent's.

900
01:06:28.974 --> 01:06:30.441
Unbelievable.

901
01:06:31.877 --> 01:06:34.243
Mom wanted me to
escort you down to DC...

902
01:06:34.313 --> 01:06:37.908
...and deliver you to St. Anthony's,
but you can't travel now.


903
01:06:38.484 --> 01:06:40.281
At least not with me.

904
01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:44.346
I'm not going. 
I took the equivalency test.

905
01:06:44.423 --> 01:06:46.391
-I don't have to go.
-Humor her.


906
01:06:46.459 --> 01:06:48.324
Humor me and fuck off.

907
01:06:50.029 --> 01:06:51.929
Apparently, they found another lump.

908
01:06:51.997 --> 01:06:52.986
Good.

909
01:07:07.146 --> 01:07:09.239
Say hello to Sookie for me.

910
01:07:21.060 --> 01:07:22.288
You see...

911
01:07:23.696 --> 01:07:25.186
...I have this....

912
01:07:27.533 --> 01:07:28.932
I feel...

913
01:07:29.602 --> 01:07:30.694
...this...

914
01:07:31.003 --> 01:07:32.402
...great...

915
01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:35.868
...pressure...

916
01:07:37.810 --> 01:07:39.471
...coming down on me.

917
01:07:41.814 --> 01:07:43.441
It's crushing me.

918
01:08:00.699 --> 01:08:04.100
It's just you and me, old man.

919
01:08:50.950 --> 01:08:52.440
Are you there?

920
01:08:53.953 --> 01:08:55.750
Oh, my God!

921
01:08:56.789 --> 01:09:00.350
I'm in the shower.
Go away. Come back later!


922
01:09:00.426 --> 01:09:03.259
-We've gotta go now. I gotta get out of here.
-What?


923
01:09:03.329 --> 01:09:07.026
We gotta go. I know we said the summer,
but we gotta go now.


924
01:09:07.333 --> 01:09:09.358
There's something that I have to tell you.

925
01:09:09.435 --> 01:09:11.460
Ollie. I know.

926
01:09:11.537 --> 01:09:15.371
-How soon can you be ready?
-I can't go with you.


927
01:09:16.242 --> 01:09:17.607
Things have changed.

928
01:09:17.876 --> 01:09:19.673
They haven't.

929
01:09:19.778 --> 01:09:23.305
You're my friend!
That hasn't changed, right?


930
01:09:23.382 --> 01:09:26.943
That hasn't changed. But....

931
01:09:27.386 --> 01:09:29.183
Ollie and I are....

932
01:09:31.323 --> 01:09:32.813
We're the same age, and--

933
01:09:36.362 --> 01:09:38.421
Calm down!

934
01:09:38.497 --> 01:09:41.364
This is perfect! 
This is fucking perfect!

935
01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:44.060
Sookie Sapperstein
and the Young Republican.


936
01:09:44.136 --> 01:09:46.934
-Of course. How natural!
-Shut up!


937
01:09:47.006 --> 01:09:48.735
You think you're what he wants?

938
01:09:48.807 --> 01:09:52.106
You think that you fit the picture
of how he wants his life to look?


939
01:09:52.177 --> 01:09:55.738
You think that he would bring you
back to our mother as a potential wife?


940
01:09:55.814 --> 01:09:57.281
Our mother?

941
01:09:57.383 --> 01:10:00.216
She'd be nice to your face,
but the first opportunity...


942
01:10:00.286 --> 01:10:02.151
...she'd pull him aside and warn him off.

943
01:10:02.221 --> 01:10:05.884
"Mongrel children have such
a hard time fitting in, dearest!"


944
01:10:05.958 --> 01:10:07.721
Shut up!

945
01:10:07.793 --> 01:10:10.489
He will lie to you!

946
01:10:10.562 --> 01:10:13.588
He will use you
up and marry some inbred...

947
01:10:13.666 --> 01:10:17.466
...Darien Frau who will beget him
all the towheaded brats he can afford.


948
01:10:17.536 --> 01:10:19.094
Go away!

949
01:10:19.171 --> 01:10:21.139
They are rigid and they are cold!

950
01:10:21.206 --> 01:10:25.700
And you don't know
they are cold to the fuckin' bone!


951
01:10:30.716 --> 01:10:33.082
I'm not going with you.

952
01:10:42.795 --> 01:10:44.160
I'm scared.

953
01:11:00.312 --> 01:11:03.543
You're just a glutton for fuckin' punishment,
aren't you, lgs?


954
01:12:15.254 --> 01:12:16.448
Russel!

955
01:12:21.460 --> 01:12:23.451
I need a job!

956
01:12:36.608 --> 01:12:37.802
Hello?

957
01:12:38.010 --> 01:12:39.170
Lisa Fiedler's?

958
01:12:40.479 --> 01:12:42.413
I know a girl from Baltimore.

959
01:12:43.415 --> 01:12:44.643
So what?

960
01:12:46.251 --> 01:12:48.151
I know a girl from Baltimore.

961
01:12:48.220 --> 01:12:50.211
What are you talking about?

962
01:12:51.457 --> 01:12:54.688
I know a girl from Baltimore!

963
01:12:54.793 --> 01:12:56.021
So do I!

964
01:12:56.428 --> 01:12:59.397
Lisa, there's some guy here for you,
but he keeps talking--


965
01:12:59.465 --> 01:13:01.194
-Who is it?
-I don't know.


966
01:13:01.266 --> 01:13:03.029
He's saying something about Baltimore?

967
01:13:03.101 --> 01:13:05.331
-The drugs!
-The drugs!


968
01:13:07.473 --> 01:13:10.135
It's me. I'm at Fiedler's house.

969
01:13:10.342 --> 01:13:13.038
She wants to know
if she can pay with a personal check.


970
01:13:13.645 --> 01:13:15.408
-You have no cash?
-No.


971
01:13:15.547 --> 01:13:18.744
I might have enough
in travelers' checks and francs.


972
01:13:18.817 --> 01:13:21.377
Her roommate
may have enough in travelers' checks.


973
01:13:21.453 --> 01:13:23.353
And francs!

974
01:13:29.495 --> 01:13:30.723
Okay.

975
01:13:31.663 --> 01:13:32.687
You'll owe us.

976
01:13:36.101 --> 01:13:39.468
Why don't you make yourself comfortable,
guy? I'll be right back.


977
01:13:45.077 --> 01:13:46.135
Miss Piggee?

978
01:13:47.079 --> 01:13:48.546
Yes?

979
01:13:48.714 --> 01:13:50.045
It's lgby.

980
01:13:51.884 --> 01:13:54.717
Ollie Slocumb's younger brother....

981
01:13:55.888 --> 01:13:58.652
Of course!

982
01:14:00.893 --> 01:14:04.056
How is Ollie? Columbia, right?

983
01:14:04.630 --> 01:14:05.722
Right.

984
01:14:06.465 --> 01:14:09.229
We're all hoping
that once he's healed from the accident...


985
01:14:09.301 --> 01:14:10.825
...that he'll be able to...

986
01:14:10.903 --> 01:14:13.565
...Iead a fairly normal life
and be able to go back to a--


987
01:14:13.639 --> 01:14:14.628
Oh, no!

988
01:14:16.108 --> 01:14:17.268
What happened?

989
01:14:18.410 --> 01:14:21.106
Apparently, as far as anyone can tell...

990
01:14:21.179 --> 01:14:25.275
...he was 10-speeding a gazillion miles an
hour through Central Park...


991
01:14:25.350 --> 01:14:28.012
...racing with all the other Young Turks.

992
01:14:28.420 --> 01:14:33.380
He apparently caught his own reflection
in the handlebar mirror, and became so...


993
01:14:33.725 --> 01:14:36.785
...aroused by it
that he burst his Speedo shorts...


994
01:14:36.862 --> 01:14:40.958
...which then got caught in the gears
and just threw him on his face, splatter.


995
01:14:41.133 --> 01:14:45.570
Luckily, someone had the presence of mind
to scrape his face off the pavement...


996
01:14:45.637 --> 01:14:46.968
...and put it on ice.

997
01:14:47.039 --> 01:14:50.167
-Doctors were able to graft most of it back--
-I'm sorry.


998
01:14:54.112 --> 01:14:55.943
And you....

999
01:14:57.282 --> 01:14:59.011
This is what you're up to.

1000
01:14:59.451 --> 01:15:01.112
Bigger-picture Darwinism.

1001
01:15:03.055 --> 01:15:05.023
You two know each other.

1002
01:15:05.257 --> 01:15:06.952
Wow!

1003
01:15:08.193 --> 01:15:11.924
Igby Slocumb was in my art class.
He was one of my students.


1004
01:15:12.364 --> 01:15:15.925
You used to call
me Miss Piggy, didn't you?

1005
01:15:16.234 --> 01:15:17.326
Yeah.

1006
01:15:23.108 --> 01:15:24.973
Do you want me
to cut this for you?

1007
01:15:30.782 --> 01:15:31.874
Fuck!

1008
01:15:36.321 --> 01:15:37.413
Lucky Charms?

1009
01:15:37.789 --> 01:15:38.778
What?

1010
01:15:38.857 --> 01:15:41.690
Fuckin' Lucky Charms!

1011
01:15:42.127 --> 01:15:43.651
I don't know.

1012
01:15:53.705 --> 01:15:55.400
Psycho bitch!

1013
01:15:58.010 --> 01:16:00.638
What did you do with her Lucky Charms?

1014
01:16:01.146 --> 01:16:02.374
Nothing.

1015
01:16:04.583 --> 01:16:06.244
She's a bit upset.

1016
01:16:07.119 --> 01:16:11.522
Her one-woman show wasn't terribly
well received at The Pyramid tonight.


1017
01:16:12.290 --> 01:16:13.655
Really?

1018
01:16:13.892 --> 01:16:16.520
The world isn't ready for Peeka!

1019
01:16:16.962 --> 01:16:18.793
-No?
-I told her.


1020
01:16:19.364 --> 01:16:22.492
Lorna Luft was just too fucking obscure.

1021
01:16:22.801 --> 01:16:24.996
People just think you're doing a bad Liza.

1022
01:16:25.737 --> 01:16:28.763
-I love Lorna.
-Me, too.


1023
01:16:36.381 --> 01:16:38.144
Your brother is looking for you.

1024
01:16:41.219 --> 01:16:42.743
Your mom is dying.

1025
01:16:42.854 --> 01:16:43.946
Yeah?

1026
01:16:46.892 --> 01:16:47.881
Yeah.

1027
01:16:49.394 --> 01:16:51.521
You know what you have
to think of it as?

1028
01:16:51.596 --> 01:16:52.722
What?

1029
01:16:54.332 --> 01:16:56.493
Like an act of God.

1030
01:16:58.070 --> 01:17:00.664
If there were a God,
he'd have acted a lot sooner.


1031
01:17:00.739 --> 01:17:02.866
-What?
-Nothing.


1032
01:17:05.110 --> 01:17:07.840
-He left you a ticket.
-Excellent.


1033
01:17:07.913 --> 01:17:09.380
It's non-refundable.

1034
01:17:09.881 --> 01:17:11.746
He wanted me to tell you that.

1035
01:17:11.950 --> 01:17:13.042
Dick.

1036
01:17:43.915 --> 01:17:45.906
I gotta take a piss.

1037
01:17:56.495 --> 01:17:57.757
Toilet paper?

1038
01:18:00.565 --> 01:18:01.554
Here.

1039
01:18:01.933 --> 01:18:03.093
It's Russel's.

1040
01:18:05.170 --> 01:18:06.831
How are you doing?

1041
01:18:07.572 --> 01:18:10.473
I'm pretty sensational, actually.

1042
01:18:11.610 --> 01:18:13.043
And you?

1043
01:18:14.012 --> 01:18:15.036
Good.

1044
01:18:15.747 --> 01:18:16.771
Really.

1045
01:18:18.016 --> 01:18:19.108
But....

1046
01:18:21.753 --> 01:18:23.380
How is D.H.?

1047
01:18:25.724 --> 01:18:27.191
Does he miss me?

1048
01:18:28.026 --> 01:18:31.189
-I haven't spoken to him since--
-I bet he does.


1049
01:18:37.469 --> 01:18:39.562
You're cute.

1050
01:18:53.852 --> 01:18:55.080
Come on.

1051
01:18:56.955 --> 01:18:58.047
Down.

1052
01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:09.892
What?

1053
01:19:10.802 --> 01:19:12.429
Your poor mother.

1054
01:19:24.883 --> 01:19:27.977
I've been hoarding Seconal
like a proper junkie.


1055
01:19:28.353 --> 01:19:29.615
I'm ready.

1056
01:19:30.355 --> 01:19:32.380
It's time to round up your brother.

1057
01:20:12.998 --> 01:20:14.260
What's this?

1058
01:20:14.499 --> 01:20:16.296
An ice-cream sundae.

1059
01:20:17.235 --> 01:20:18.497
I accept.

1060
01:20:22.240 --> 01:20:24.936
I'm going to DC this weekend
and kill my mother.


1061
01:20:25.377 --> 01:20:26.776
I'm shocked.

1062
01:20:29.147 --> 01:20:30.637
Ollie called me.

1063
01:20:31.549 --> 01:20:33.574
Apparently, he called everybody.

1064
01:20:33.652 --> 01:20:35.017
Stole your thunder.

1065
01:20:35.086 --> 01:20:36.553
Asshole.

1066
01:20:38.890 --> 01:20:42.917
-This must be very hard on you.
-Not as fucking hard as it's gonna be on her.


1067
01:20:42.994 --> 01:20:46.327
-You're just angry and confused.
-Oh, my God, don't do that to me.


1068
01:20:46.398 --> 01:20:48.628
-What?
-Psych 101 me.


1069
01:20:48.700 --> 01:20:51.726
You're a furious boy. I mean,
eventually you won't be a boy...


1070
01:20:51.803 --> 01:20:54.499
-...and it'll eat you up.
-Furious boy?


1071
01:20:54.806 --> 01:20:58.401
The thought
that I'm going to live my life without...


1072
01:20:58.476 --> 01:21:02.378
...ever having told her to fuck off,
is pretty goddamn infuriating.


1073
01:21:16.094 --> 01:21:17.857
Do you hate my guts?

1074
01:21:18.563 --> 01:21:20.155
For a month I did.

1075
01:21:20.365 --> 01:21:22.265
Now you're not even in my top five.

1076
01:21:22.734 --> 01:21:23.826
Good.

1077
01:21:24.035 --> 01:21:25.593
I missed you.

1078
01:21:27.706 --> 01:21:30.402
My life is, I don't know.

1079
01:21:30.608 --> 01:21:32.235
I'm drowning in assholes.

1080
01:21:33.445 --> 01:21:35.037
I'm your friend.

1081
01:21:38.249 --> 01:21:40.149
Listen, after....

1082
01:21:40.919 --> 01:21:43.012
I'm not coming back. 
Not to New York.

1083
01:21:43.521 --> 01:21:44.715
I know.

1084
01:21:46.992 --> 01:21:49.153
Can we go to your mom's apartment
and have sex?


1085
01:21:49.227 --> 01:21:50.216
No!

1086
01:21:50.695 --> 01:21:53.186
You think that'll make you
feel better? It won't.


1087
01:21:53.264 --> 01:21:56.358
It'll just make you
feel really empty and sad.

1088
01:21:57.535 --> 01:21:59.503
You're better off masturbating.

1089
01:22:05.377 --> 01:22:07.038
Thank you for coming down.

1090
01:22:07.579 --> 01:22:09.911
Didn't want to fuck
up my inheritance, did l?

1091
01:22:11.649 --> 01:22:13.617
Ollie has talked to you?

1092
01:22:16.888 --> 01:22:19.379
He explained what is to take place?

1093
01:22:19.524 --> 01:22:23.255
He said something about bludgeoning you
with a phone, but he didn't really...


1094
01:22:23.328 --> 01:22:25.193
...go into specifics.

1095
01:22:34.005 --> 01:22:38.203
The irony is that I took for granted
I'd outlive you all.


1096
01:22:38.276 --> 01:22:41.370
You'd think, in this family,
that I would be the least likely.


1097
01:22:42.213 --> 01:22:45.512
Jason, happy as a clam.
He'll live forever in the institution, you--


1098
01:22:45.583 --> 01:22:48.609
You know, just because you're dying,
I'm not going to apologize.


1099
01:22:48.686 --> 01:22:51.280
Not for anything that I've ever done.

1100
01:22:53.158 --> 01:22:55.353
Why do you want
me to be here, Mother?

1101
01:22:57.295 --> 01:22:58.762
Comic relief?

1102
01:23:25.323 --> 01:23:27.120
I'm going for a walk.

1103
01:23:36.468 --> 01:23:39.130
-Ollie, what are you drinking?
-Scotch.


1104
01:23:39.504 --> 01:23:40.698
Scotch!

1105
01:23:42.674 --> 01:23:45.609
-I guess D.H. told you.
-What?


1106
01:23:45.944 --> 01:23:50.176
We've decided to bump
all those incredibly prominent and...


1107
01:23:50.248 --> 01:23:54.651
...terribly chic persons that you were
expecting to speak at your memorial, and...


1108
01:23:54.853 --> 01:23:57.014
...have me speak for two hours or so.

1109
01:23:57.088 --> 01:23:58.851
What a clever idea.

1110
01:23:59.591 --> 01:24:01.889
You do understand, though,
don't you, that...


1111
01:24:01.993 --> 01:24:06.794
...it is customary in a eulogy to
at least make reference to the deceased?


1112
01:24:07.098 --> 01:24:08.895
I intend to, Mother.

1113
01:24:10.001 --> 01:24:11.468
Time permitting.

1114
01:24:16.808 --> 01:24:18.571
Are we ready?

1115
01:24:20.011 --> 01:24:21.342
Shall we do this?

1116
01:24:23.681 --> 01:24:27.242
You know, once we start, you must
get as much inside you as possible.


1117
01:24:27.318 --> 01:24:29.616
We've been through this.

1118
01:24:31.089 --> 01:24:33.319
I don't want to
have to do this again.

1119
01:24:45.537 --> 01:24:49.837
Is that strawberry? I thought the idea was
to stop me from vomiting up the poison.


1120
01:24:57.482 --> 01:24:58.642
Wait.

1121
01:25:01.953 --> 01:25:04.649
I take it you know D.
H. is your father.

1122
01:25:06.424 --> 01:25:07.448
No.

1123
01:25:07.525 --> 01:25:10.323
Then I'm really glad I told you.

1124
01:25:12.063 --> 01:25:13.792
Make yum-yum.

1125
01:25:33.985 --> 01:25:36.419
Much love, all right?

1126
01:27:02.707 --> 01:27:05.267
C'mon, wake up!

1127
01:27:12.417 --> 01:27:14.044
Come on!

1128
01:27:21.025 --> 01:27:22.356
I'm sorry.

1129
01:27:52.890 --> 01:27:54.152
Listen....

1130
01:27:55.793 --> 01:27:59.354
Do you wanna see the body
before they come to collect it?


1131
01:28:08.740 --> 01:28:10.207
I've seen it.

1132
01:28:36.634 --> 01:28:37.794
Excuse me.

1133
01:28:44.742 --> 01:28:46.642
Hello, Mrs. Hathaway?

1134
01:28:47.979 --> 01:28:50.106
This is Jason Slocumb, Jr.

1135
01:28:54.886 --> 01:28:56.615
I'm afraid she can't.

1136
01:28:57.321 --> 01:28:58.845
'Cause she's dead.

1137
01:28:59.223 --> 01:29:02.522
He's always enjoyed
being the bearer of bad tidings.


1138
01:29:07.832 --> 01:29:10.062
Hello, Mrs. Bittle. It's lgby.

1139
01:29:11.202 --> 01:29:14.137
-lf you could sign this release.
-I'd love to, Mrs. Bittle...


1140
01:29:14.205 --> 01:29:15.729
...but she's dead.

1141
01:29:32.190 --> 01:29:33.452
Great job.

1142
01:29:34.025 --> 01:29:35.049
Thank you.

1143
01:29:35.560 --> 01:29:36.720
Aunt Penelope?

1144
01:29:37.528 --> 01:29:40.793
-It's lgby.
-This all seems to be in order.


1145
01:29:41.699 --> 01:29:43.132
I'm in Washington.

1146
01:29:43.868 --> 01:29:46.860
This is for you and your helpers.

1147
01:29:46.938 --> 01:29:49.873
Thank you very much.
That's very generous of you.


1148
01:29:52.677 --> 01:29:55.578
I'm sure she'd love to, 
Aunt Penelope.

1149
01:29:55.646 --> 01:29:58.114
Except for one thing.

1150
01:30:19.403 --> 01:30:21.769
Yes, Aunt Penelope, 
I'm sure she was.

1151
01:30:23.341 --> 01:30:24.569
Tuesday.

1152
01:30:25.042 --> 01:30:26.202
Thank you.

1153
01:30:27.078 --> 01:30:28.170
Bye-bye.

1154
01:30:34.886 --> 01:30:36.376
It's ironic...

1155
01:30:38.222 --> 01:30:41.453
...that the first time
in my entire life that I feel...


1156
01:30:41.526 --> 01:30:44.495
...remotely affectionate toward her
is when she's dead.


1157
01:30:47.865 --> 01:30:49.765
You beat up her corpse.

1158
01:30:51.235 --> 01:30:52.759
After that.

1159
01:30:53.704 --> 01:30:56.605
The service is in two days.
You can stay in your old room.


1160
01:30:56.674 --> 01:30:58.835
You killed her. You bury her.

1161
01:31:00.545 --> 01:31:01.910
I'm joking.

1162
01:31:03.281 --> 01:31:07.411
Listen, I've got this discount fare, and...

1163
01:31:08.219 --> 01:31:10.517
...it'd be kinda hypocritical of me.

1164
01:31:10.955 --> 01:31:12.149
You know.

1165
01:31:13.190 --> 01:31:16.489
-You'll handle it like everything else, right?
-Right.


1166
01:31:18.563 --> 01:31:19.894
You should hate me.

1167
01:31:20.031 --> 01:31:21.259
I don't.

1168
01:31:21.399 --> 01:31:23.526
-You should.
-I don't hate you.


1169
01:31:23.668 --> 01:31:25.226
Don't be indulgent.

1170
01:31:25.703 --> 01:31:26.897
Never that.

1171
01:31:28.506 --> 01:31:31.964
-You're going to California?
-Yep. The Sunshine State.


1172
01:31:32.043 --> 01:31:34.739
Actually, Florida's the Sunshine State.

1173
01:31:35.112 --> 01:31:36.306
Really?

1174
01:31:38.115 --> 01:31:40.174
Three thousand fuckin' miles
away from here.


1175
01:31:40.418 --> 01:31:42.579
Is there a number
where we can reach you?

1176
01:31:42.653 --> 01:31:44.120
We? No.

1177
01:31:44.655 --> 01:31:46.452
You'll call when there is.

1178
01:31:52.463 --> 01:31:55.125
There really isn't that much
between us, is there?


1179
01:31:56.067 --> 01:31:58.558
Just an ever-diminishing amount of blood.

1180
01:32:02.807 --> 01:32:03.865
Bye.

1181
01:32:09.046 --> 01:32:10.377
Well done.
