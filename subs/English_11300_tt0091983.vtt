- That's not my neighbourhood.


30
00:03:27.947 --> 00:03:31.696
Oh, yeah. There's a pool hall up there.
That's your main place.


31
00:03:31.826 --> 00:03:34.661
Excuse me. Excuse me,
can I get my check?


32
00:03:34.787 --> 00:03:38.073
Hey, Charlie, check for
the gentleman in the front.


33
00:03:42.753 --> 00:03:45.291
- Enjoy it? Here's the check.
- Thank you, Dottie.


34
00:03:45.423 --> 00:03:49.171
Hey, whaddaya say, Frenchy!
How are you, my friend?


35
00:04:16.453 --> 00:04:19.371
Hey, you! Hey! Hey!

36
00:04:19.498 --> 00:04:22.867
- Hey, you didn't pay for your lunch.
- What?


37
00:04:23.001 --> 00:04:26.750
- You didn't pay your bill, big boy.
- Oh, sure I paid. Didn't I?


38
00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.122
The check's in your pocket.

39
00:04:30.259 --> 00:04:32.085
Oh.

40
00:04:35.764 --> 00:04:39.263
You're right.
OK, let me take care of that right now.


41
00:04:39.393 --> 00:04:42.512
I'm sorry. I don't know
how this happened. It's just I...


42
00:04:42.646 --> 00:04:47.604
It's just... I got a lot of things on my mind,
business things, and I simply forgot.


43
00:04:47.734 --> 00:04:50.142
You deliberately walked out
without paying.


44
00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:54.573
I did not. Here, come on. Just take
the money and keep the change and...


45
00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.941
Fine. Maybe you'd like to tell a cop.

46
00:04:57.077 --> 00:04:59.532
No! No, no... don't... no, don't.

47
00:05:03.083 --> 00:05:07.163
Let me guess.
Sometimes you don't pay for your lunch.


48
00:05:07.462 --> 00:05:11.211
Or maybe you steal the occasional
candy bar, or newspaper.


49
00:05:12.968 --> 00:05:15.007
You're a closet rebel.

50
00:05:18.056 --> 00:05:21.176
Oh, that's my telepager.
I gotta call the office.


51
00:05:26.106 --> 00:05:28.941
Which way are you goin'?
I'll give you a ride.


52
00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.777
Well, don't you... don't you
have to go back to work?


53
00:05:34.572 --> 00:05:36.232
I don't work there.

54
00:05:36.825 --> 00:05:40.739
W-wait, wait, wait. What's all this
business about the, uh... check?


55
00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.160
Are you coming?

56
00:05:44.624 --> 00:05:48.918
Uh, well, I, uh... all right.
It's just I gotta go by the bank. And then...


57
00:05:54.592 --> 00:05:56.134
- Thank you.
- Wanna die young?


58
00:05:56.427 --> 00:05:58.799
I gotta go by the bank,
then down to the office.


59
00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:01.053
- I'll drop you off.
- It's downtown.


60
00:06:01.182 --> 00:06:03.221
It's on my way.

61
00:06:10.441 --> 00:06:12.066
Ready or not, babe?

62
00:06:15.154 --> 00:06:18.855
You think that was pretty funny,
don't you? The way you...


63
00:06:20.618 --> 00:06:23.109
The way you had me goin' back there.

64
00:06:23.621 --> 00:06:27.204
- It was all right. I'm Lulu.
- Charles. Pleased to meet you.


65
00:06:29.835 --> 00:06:31.875
<i>Whoa!</i>

66
00:06:32.004 --> 00:06:36.002
<i>- Ooh, yikes!
- Whoo! That was...</i>


67
00:06:36.133 --> 00:06:38.422
Wait, wait, wait, wait. 
Where are we goin'?

68
00:06:38.552 --> 00:06:40.379
- I know a short cut.
- Oh, good.


69
00:06:40.513 --> 00:06:42.968
<i>-
- Oh, crap.</i>

70
00:06:43.098 --> 00:06:45.138
- Let me see.
- Oh. It's the...


71
00:06:46.101 --> 00:06:50.479
Hey, that's... Uh, wait.
This is the Holland Tunnel. This is wrong.


72
00:06:50.606 --> 00:06:53.358
- Are you listening to me? Go back.
- Charlie...


73
00:06:53.484 --> 00:06:55.311
What are you doing?

74
00:06:55.444 --> 00:06:58.564
You're crazy.
You really know that? Oh, God!


75
00:06:58.697 --> 00:07:01.615
I gotta go to work.
I got meetings, a million calls...


76
00:07:01.742 --> 00:07:05.490
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Hey, relax, Charlie. Come on.


77
00:07:05.621 --> 00:07:08.028
Take the afternoon off.

78
00:07:08.165 --> 00:07:10.703
You deserve it. Really.

79
00:07:10.834 --> 00:07:15.662
I can't just take the afternoon off.
What, are you n... nuts?


80
00:07:15.797 --> 00:07:21.302
All right, look, you turn around when we
get out of the tunnel. Let's just go back.


81
00:07:21.428 --> 00:07:23.468
- This isn't funny.
- Want a drink?


82
00:07:23.722 --> 00:07:27.091
No, don't! God, don't drink!
Please, this is dangerous.


83
00:07:27.225 --> 00:07:29.265
Don't do that. God, don't.

84
00:07:30.187 --> 00:07:33.603
Look, if you don't turn around
and take me back,


85
00:07:33.732 --> 00:07:36.816
you're gonna make me do something
that I don't wanna do.


86
00:07:37.402 --> 00:07:39.442
I can hardly wait, Charlie.

87
00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:09.631
- Nice ring you got there, Charlie.
- Thank you.


88
00:08:09.768 --> 00:08:12.259
You been married a long time?

89
00:08:12.395 --> 00:08:14.851
Just tell me where we're going, all right?

90
00:08:14.981 --> 00:08:19.145
- How many kids do you have, Charlie?
- That's not your concern.


91
00:08:19.277 --> 00:08:21.566
Come on! Let's see the pictures.

92
00:08:21.696 --> 00:08:24.531
What makes you think
I got pictures of my kids?


93
00:08:24.657 --> 00:08:27.528
- Are you afraid of me, Charlie?
- I'm not afraid of you.


94
00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:30.330
- Let me see 'em.
- All right, if you want to.


95
00:08:31.789 --> 00:08:34.826
- Right there.
- Mm.


96
00:08:34.959 --> 00:08:37.450
Very nice, Charlie. 
I'm impressed.

97
00:08:37.754 --> 00:08:39.793
Thank you.

98
00:08:40.757 --> 00:08:44.256
"Charles Driggs. 
Regional Manager."

99
00:08:44.635 --> 00:08:48.300
They just made me vice president.
I start Monday, as a matter of fact.


100
00:08:48.431 --> 00:08:50.470
Oh, yeah? Vice president?

101
00:08:52.268 --> 00:08:56.016
Oh, well. Here's to you, 
Mr Vice President.

102
00:08:58.566 --> 00:09:00.060
- Want some?
- No, no.


103
00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:04.192
Come on, Charlie.
Come on! It's OK.


104
00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:07.816
- No, thank you very much.
- Be a sport, Charlie.


105
00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:10.737
All right, what the heck. Give me it.

106
00:09:44.653 --> 00:09:48.733
- I wanna get another bottle.
- OK, I'm gonna phone my secretary.


107
00:10:05.382 --> 00:10:09.795
Hi. I need four pints
of some Scotch, please.


108
00:10:13.598 --> 00:10:16.136
Hey, babe, you work here or what?

109
00:10:16.268 --> 00:10:18.307
- Four?
- Yeah.


110
00:10:19.771 --> 00:10:22.227
<i>Why, of course.</i>

111
00:10:22.774 --> 00:10:24.814
Hi, pooch.

112
00:10:28.029 --> 00:10:29.488
Two.

113
00:10:29.614 --> 00:10:31.607
Stocks acquired before one January '84

114
00:10:31.741 --> 00:10:37.080
should not be subject to anti-straddle
rules, however long they may be held.


115
00:10:37.205 --> 00:10:41.037
I hope none of the above causes
any undue concern. Charles S Driggs.


116
00:10:46.756 --> 00:10:48.796
Thank you very much.

117
00:10:50.969 --> 00:10:53.008
Oh...

118
00:10:53.304 --> 00:10:55.546
Is that Glenlivet up there?

119
00:10:56.349 --> 00:10:58.472
- It is Glenlivet, isn't it?
- Mm-hm.


120
00:10:58.601 --> 00:11:03.180
I gotta have a bottle. I'm sorry to make
you get up there, but it's my favourite.


121
00:11:03.314 --> 00:11:05.354
- Of course.
- Thank you.


122
00:11:06.276 --> 00:11:10.902
The reason that I like Scotch so much
is because my family's Scottish.


123
00:11:11.906 --> 00:11:14.693
My mother's mother was an O'Connor.

124
00:11:14.826 --> 00:11:17.233
Oh, really? How bloody interesting.

125
00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:19.409
That makes me, like, a quarter Scottish.

126
00:11:19.622 --> 00:11:23.454
My father's mother, she was a Hawthorne.

127
00:11:23.626 --> 00:11:25.749
<i>I've just about got it.</i>

128
00:11:25.962 --> 00:11:31.300
Little Willy was conceived on our trip
to Scotland a number of years ago...


129
00:11:31.425 --> 00:11:35.423
Oh, crap. See if you can get me out
of that five o'clock squash with Graves.


130
00:11:35.554 --> 00:11:36.965
Tell him... Lynn?

131
00:11:37.098 --> 00:11:39.339
That was the office, for Christ's...

132
00:11:43.437 --> 00:11:45.477
Coming?

133
00:11:48.109 --> 00:11:52.153
There's a tax act in the works that
would authorise regulations to be written


134
00:11:52.279 --> 00:11:56.111
amplifying what is meant
by "substantial reduction".


135
00:11:56.242 --> 00:11:58.281
What?

136
00:11:58.452 --> 00:12:03.447
Charlie, what do you do for fun
besides steal candy bars? Huh?


137
00:12:03.582 --> 00:12:06.619
You were right. I'm a rebel.

138
00:12:07.253 --> 00:12:11.582
I am! I just channelled my rebellion into
the mainstream. I'll give you an example.


139
00:12:11.715 --> 00:12:14.633
In '81, I went long-term munis.

140
00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:17.465
Everybody said
"Driggs, you're crazy, don't do it."


141
00:12:17.596 --> 00:12:19.885
- Munis?
- Municipal bonds. Tax-free.


142
00:12:20.015 --> 00:12:22.684
Hell, I was locking in close to 15.

143
00:12:23.936 --> 00:12:27.885
I may look straight,
but deep down, I got what it takes.


144
00:12:28.232 --> 00:12:30.271
- Do you?
- Whoa!


145
00:12:35.906 --> 00:12:38.278
- What's this?
- Getting a room.


146
00:12:58.053 --> 00:13:00.508
Something wrong, Charlie?

147
00:13:02.098 --> 00:13:05.550
Maybe it's not such a good idea,
getting a room.


148
00:13:05.685 --> 00:13:09.979
- Don't you have someplace we could go?
- How about your place?


149
00:13:10.106 --> 00:13:13.807
I can just see the neighbours
watching you get out of the car.


150
00:13:14.069 --> 00:13:16.524
You have money?

151
00:13:18.448 --> 00:13:21.532
I mean, for the room.
The rest is free.


152
00:13:22.452 --> 00:13:24.445
Well, uh...

153
00:13:24.579 --> 00:13:26.406
Let me check.

154
00:13:27.082 --> 00:13:30.367
I only got these credit cards -
which are company plastic.


155
00:13:30.502 --> 00:13:34.914
Our accountant would wonder what I was
doing in a motel on a Friday afternoon.


156
00:13:35.048 --> 00:13:38.381
- Use the cash.
- No, I can't use that.


157
00:13:38.509 --> 00:13:41.961
- Why?
- That's money for the Christmas Club.


158
00:13:43.473 --> 00:13:46.474
<i>Are we not gonna get a room</i>

159
00:13:46.601 --> 00:13:51.595
because you're saving for Christmas
presents? In the middle of June?


160
00:14:12.376 --> 00:14:16.374
It's not bad. I've stayed in worse.
Not much of a view, though.


161
00:14:26.807 --> 00:14:31.884
I want you to know that I've, uh...
never done anything like this before.


162
00:14:32.021 --> 00:14:33.978
Don't worry, Charlie. I have.

163
00:14:38.444 --> 00:14:41.065
I wanna leave the T-shirt on, OK?

164
00:14:41.197 --> 00:14:45.277
- Why's that?
- I don't know. I don't feel comfortable yet.


165
00:14:56.003 --> 00:14:58.042
Oh, gosh.

166
00:15:17.858 --> 00:15:21.393
<i>- How do you feel now, Charlie?
- Good.</i>


167
00:15:27.701 --> 00:15:29.444
Want some?

168
00:15:29.578 --> 00:15:31.736
Yeah. Thank you.

169
00:15:38.795 --> 00:15:41.333
Can I help you find anything?

170
00:15:41.464 --> 00:15:43.374
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

171
00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:49.510
Ch
-Ch
-Charlie.

172
00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:04.400
You game?

173
00:16:06.156 --> 00:16:08.195
You're a funny girl.

174
00:16:12.412 --> 00:16:14.203
Ow!

175
00:16:18.042 --> 00:16:19.453
Agh! Yeah...

176
00:16:34.434 --> 00:16:37.684
Oh, God! That's... 
That's a new T-shirt!

177
00:16:55.329 --> 00:16:57.286
Oh, Jesus...

178
00:16:57.415 --> 00:17:01.543
Charlie, you must not
be getting enough at home.


179
00:17:12.012 --> 00:17:15.464
- Mm, you look good enough to eat.
- Oh, thank you.


180
00:17:27.194 --> 00:17:28.605
Oh, God...

181
00:17:28.737 --> 00:17:30.611
What are you doing?

182
00:17:31.907 --> 00:17:33.947
Making a call...

183
00:17:34.493 --> 00:17:38.360
Yeah, operator. 2127-247-270.

184
00:17:40.165 --> 00:17:41.494
No! Don't!

185
00:17:41.625 --> 00:17:43.665
God! Oh, God!

186
00:17:49.383 --> 00:17:51.043
Charles Driggs' office.

187
00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:53.929
- Is Charlie there, please?
- No!


188
00:17:54.596 --> 00:17:59.175
He's not? It's 3.30. Shouldn't he be back
from lunch by now?


189
00:17:59.309 --> 00:18:01.053
- Oh, please don't!
- Shh!


190
00:18:01.186 --> 00:18:04.104
Who is this, please?
I can take a message for Mr Driggs.


191
00:18:04.356 --> 00:18:07.392
No, this is a matter
of considerable urgency.


192
00:18:07.567 --> 00:18:10.402
<i>
- Please connect me to his superior.</i>

193
00:18:10.529 --> 00:18:12.735
Good afternoon, 
Richard Graves' office.

194
00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:17.451
Yes, Mr Richard Graves, please.
Mr Charles Driggs is calling.


195
00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:19.820
Yes?

196
00:18:20.163 --> 00:18:22.950
Richard, Charles Driggs here.
Yeah, listen...


197
00:18:23.083 --> 00:18:27.495
Yeah, no, just calling to let you know
that I won't be back this afternoon.


198
00:18:27.629 --> 00:18:29.835
You won't be back? 
Is something wrong?

199
00:18:29.965 --> 00:18:34.294
No, no problem. I'm just stuck in outside
meetings. You know how that goes.


200
00:18:34.427 --> 00:18:36.753
I'd hoped we'd be able to huddle today.

201
00:18:36.971 --> 00:18:39.011
Oh, sorry about that.

202
00:18:40.266 --> 00:18:43.351
Well, no, I was just gonna
throw that to Dillman.


203
00:18:44.312 --> 00:18:45.771
Yeah.

204
00:18:45.897 --> 00:18:47.688
Yeah, I'm writing this down.

205
00:18:47.816 --> 00:18:50.141
Oh, Charlie. Oh, Charlie...

206
00:18:50.276 --> 00:18:53.692
How about I have copies on your desk
first thing Monday?


207
00:18:53.822 --> 00:18:56.147
Wouldn't that... 
Yeah, all right, sure.

208
00:18:56.282 --> 00:18:57.611
Goodbye.

209
00:18:57.825 --> 00:18:59.154
Oooh!

210
00:18:59.285 --> 00:19:03.330
Charlie, you're a really good liar
when you wanna be.


211
00:19:03.456 --> 00:19:05.496
Oh, jeez! Don't stop, please.

212
00:19:11.005 --> 00:19:14.670
<i>Both her arms were covered with rings
and jewellery...</i>


213
00:19:14.801 --> 00:19:18.419
<i>Accoutrements of black, Satanistic...
Please, I'm on TV.</i>


214
00:19:18.554 --> 00:19:21.970
<i>- And you say she was armed?
- Definitely armed.</i>


215
00:19:22.099 --> 00:19:24.769
<i>It looked like a 9
millimetre or a.38 to me.</i>

216
00:19:26.896 --> 00:19:28.935
Oh, God, what time is it?

217
00:19:29.065 --> 00:19:31.307
Time to get the hell outta Dodge.

218
00:19:31.442 --> 00:19:35.570
- If you wanna take a shower, hurry.
- Why? We leave now, we hit traffic.


219
00:19:35.696 --> 00:19:37.985
I'm not going back.
You have to take a bus.


220
00:19:38.115 --> 00:19:41.780
- Why, where are you going?
- Pennsylvania, back to where I grew up.


221
00:19:41.911 --> 00:19:44.995
Oh, really?
It's hard to imagine you growing up.


222
00:19:45.748 --> 00:19:48.286
What, you think I was born like this?

223
00:19:55.591 --> 00:19:58.047
Yeah, I'm writing this down!

224
00:20:03.224 --> 00:20:05.679
"He should be back. It's 3.30!"

225
00:20:07.645 --> 00:20:12.353
Hi, honey. I know it's short notice,
but I've been called away on business.


226
00:20:12.941 --> 00:20:18.149
I've got a meeting tonight in Philadelphia.
Yeah, well, what are you gonna do?


227
00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:22.029
So, I should be home tomorrow evening.
For sure.


228
00:20:22.367 --> 00:20:26.282
Or maybe tomorrow morning.
Could be even later tonight.


229
00:20:26.413 --> 00:20:30.162
<i>
- Depending on, you know... 
Depending.</i>

230
00:20:30.292 --> 00:20:32.498
So, love you too, and goodbye.

231
00:20:36.632 --> 00:20:39.205
Sure you know what you're doing?

232
00:20:39.343 --> 00:20:42.047
No. But what the hell, you know?

233
00:20:51.688 --> 00:20:53.728
Mom & Dad's. Dad speaking.

234
00:20:55.150 --> 00:21:00.275
...Mickey Lolich pitching to a Babe Ruth
with Tony Lazzeri on second base...


235
00:21:00.405 --> 00:21:03.157
Thanks, Rose.
...whether you put Mickey Stanley...


236
00:21:03.283 --> 00:21:05.988
<i>-
- What? What's so funny?</i>


237
00:21:06.119 --> 00:21:08.277
- You.
- What? What'd I do?


238
00:21:08.413 --> 00:21:10.738
Calling the waitress by her name.

239
00:21:10.874 --> 00:21:13.116
That's what name tags are for.

240
00:21:13.251 --> 00:21:15.659
- There you go.
- Thanks, Rose.


241
00:21:16.713 --> 00:21:21.541
Just makes things a little friendlier,
a little more personal. I like that.


242
00:21:21.676 --> 00:21:24.167
- Yeah. Charlie Driggs.
- Yeah.


243
00:21:25.722 --> 00:21:27.761
What do we got?

244
00:21:28.224 --> 00:21:30.762
Oh, my gosh. I don't believe this.

245
00:21:31.519 --> 00:21:35.731
I have got $4 left from the Christmas Club
money. I don't be...


246
00:21:35.857 --> 00:21:38.478
I'll get it, Charlie. 
You got the room.

247
00:21:39.235 --> 00:21:42.022
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.


248
00:21:42.155 --> 00:21:44.194
I'll be right back.

249
00:21:50.955 --> 00:21:54.953
I like you, Charlie.
You're a really nice guy.


250
00:21:56.335 --> 00:21:58.375
Maybe a little too nice.

251
00:21:59.589 --> 00:22:03.421
No, I'm sorry, we don't have a thing
available until after 7.15.


252
00:22:03.551 --> 00:22:05.175
Yeah, that's OK.

253
00:22:33.622 --> 00:22:36.872
- Goodnight, Rose.
- The young woman said you'd get this.


254
00:22:37.001 --> 00:22:39.622
- She didn't pay for this?
- No, sir.


255
00:22:40.129 --> 00:22:42.168
Lulu?

256
00:22:43.007 --> 00:22:45.711
She said the gentleman
would pay for dinner.


257
00:22:46.468 --> 00:22:47.713
You...

258
00:22:47.845 --> 00:22:49.884
The gentleman would...

259
00:22:50.472 --> 00:22:53.142
This is absolutely unbelievable. Uh...

260
00:22:54.059 --> 00:22:58.057
Well, that's no problem, Rose.
I'll take care of that lickety-split.


261
00:22:58.772 --> 00:23:01.690
Sorry. The, uh, credit cards.
How about that?


262
00:23:01.817 --> 00:23:04.189
We don't accept any credit cards.

263
00:23:04.319 --> 00:23:05.897
Uh...

264
00:23:06.446 --> 00:23:08.605
<i>Any credit cards.</i>

265
00:23:08.949 --> 00:23:10.906
Problem, Dad?

266
00:23:11.368 --> 00:23:13.408
Possible cash-flow problem.

267
00:23:13.537 --> 00:23:17.866
No, there's no problem at all.
I don't think that there...

268
00:23:20.002 --> 00:23:23.335
...there's anything to worry about.
Come on, fellas.


269
00:23:23.463 --> 00:23:27.627
I mean, do I look like a guy who'd run out
on a check? I mean, come on!


270
00:23:30.011 --> 00:23:31.969
You guys!

271
00:23:32.097 --> 00:23:34.469
Come on, Charlie! Come on, Charlie!

272
00:23:37.853 --> 00:23:39.311
Yeah! Yee-hah!

273
00:23:39.437 --> 00:23:42.142
What are you doing?!
I could've been killed!


274
00:23:42.274 --> 00:23:44.729
You know you don't like
paying those things.


275
00:23:44.859 --> 00:23:48.145
I still got the old wheels, don't I?
Did you see me?


276
00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:50.771
You're pretty quick for an old guy.

277
00:23:51.825 --> 00:23:54.779
The guy didn't get the license number,
did he?


278
00:23:54.911 --> 00:23:56.702
Oh, Charlie.

279
00:24:10.552 --> 00:24:12.591
# Wild thing

280
00:24:14.222 --> 00:24:16.261
# You make my heart sing

281
00:24:18.851 --> 00:24:20.891
# You make everything

282
00:24:21.354 --> 00:24:23.393
# Groovy

283
00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:26.480
# Wild thing

284
00:24:30.279 --> 00:24:33.565
# Wild thing, I think I love you

285
00:24:34.742 --> 00:24:37.779
# But I wanna know for sure

286
00:24:39.622 --> 00:24:42.291
# Come on and hold me tight

287
00:24:47.713 --> 00:24:51.082
- Where, Charlie? Here?
- 30 feet, 20 feet...


288
00:24:51.217 --> 00:24:54.052
- We're almost... You missed it.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!


289
00:24:54.178 --> 00:24:55.672
Careful, careful!

290
00:24:55.805 --> 00:24:58.426
<i>Fine, all right. Just park it. Fine.</i>

291
00:24:58.557 --> 00:25:01.511
Park it. Lock it. Let's go.
Just leave it here.


292
00:25:01.644 --> 00:25:04.479
- Charlie, where are you?
- Ow. I'm all right.


293
00:25:04.605 --> 00:25:06.645
<i>You all right?</i>

294
00:25:07.525 --> 00:25:11.653
- Save the burgers.
- The hamburgers. Charlie!


295
00:25:11.779 --> 00:25:14.815
Where'd you go?
Watch out, there's a small cliff...


296
00:25:35.803 --> 00:25:39.421
<i>-I'll fix you up.
- Anything. It's killin' me.</i>


297
00:25:39.556 --> 00:25:41.513
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

298
00:25:44.311 --> 00:25:48.807
Hey, listen, you knock one over the fence
for your old man, all right? OK.


299
00:25:48.941 --> 00:25:50.980
Tell Scott I love him.

300
00:25:51.401 --> 00:25:53.608
OK. Great. Good. Bye.

301
00:25:58.033 --> 00:26:00.191
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

302
00:26:01.078 --> 00:26:05.953
Take half of it now, half of it later
and you'll feel a lot better. There ya go.


303
00:26:06.083 --> 00:26:09.582
Remember, it's better to be a live dog
than a dead lion.


304
00:26:09.711 --> 00:26:12.332
I've felt the same way before.

305
00:26:12.464 --> 00:26:14.753
- Good luck to you.
- Yeah, thank you.


306
00:26:26.645 --> 00:26:28.684
Lulu?

307
00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:32.730
Lulu?

308
00:26:32.859 --> 00:26:35.528
- Oh. I'm sorry.
- What? Come here.


309
00:26:35.653 --> 00:26:38.690
- What's that?
- Uh... well, it's, you know...


310
00:26:38.823 --> 00:26:42.987
It took a while, but the whisky
caught up with me, I guess.


311
00:26:43.703 --> 00:26:45.743
How can you drink that stuff?

312
00:26:45.914 --> 00:26:50.161
I have to. My head's killing me.
I haven't had hard liquor in years.


313
00:27:01.304 --> 00:27:03.380
Hair of the dog that bit you, babe.

314
00:27:03.806 --> 00:27:07.258
God, no, no! Jesus, don't drink that!
No. I'm serious.


315
00:27:08.436 --> 00:27:12.350
- You drank enough of it last night.
- Last night was last night.


316
00:27:12.482 --> 00:27:14.439
- Here. Have some of this.
- No.


317
00:27:14.567 --> 00:27:16.358
No, don't tell me no, please.

318
00:27:16.486 --> 00:27:20.566
- This is better for you. It's tried and true.
- I don't want any of it.


319
00:27:20.698 --> 00:27:22.691
- Do you have a hangover?
- Yes.


320
00:27:22.825 --> 00:27:27.534
Then this is the stuff you drink
for a hangover. Come on. Drink it, please.


321
00:27:28.831 --> 00:27:29.661
- No.
- Please.


322
00:27:29.790 --> 00:27:30.537
- No.
- Please!


323
00:27:30.666 --> 00:27:32.706
- No!
- Drink it!


324
00:27:39.091 --> 00:27:41.131
Thank you.

325
00:27:47.349 --> 00:27:49.259
Shit!

326
00:27:49.393 --> 00:27:52.976
The guy at the restaurant
must have got the license number.


327
00:27:53.105 --> 00:27:55.561
- Is this your car, pal?
- Huh?


328
00:27:55.691 --> 00:27:58.478
I've been admiring your bike.

329
00:27:58.611 --> 00:28:00.852
You interested in motorcycles?

330
00:28:01.405 --> 00:28:04.572
No, I just like
big things between my legs.

331
00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:06.739
Thank you, officer.

332
00:28:08.704 --> 00:28:10.910
Damn, I left my suitcase in the car.

333
00:28:11.582 --> 00:28:15.911
I cannot afford to get mixed up
in things like this! I got responsibilities!


334
00:28:16.044 --> 00:28:19.248
Don't worry about the car.
It's gonna be fine.


335
00:28:19.381 --> 00:28:23.426
Oh, well, I am worried.
Let's just don't blow what we have here.


336
00:28:23.844 --> 00:28:26.251
What are we... 
We gotta get that car back!

337
00:28:26.388 --> 00:28:28.428
Just back off, Charlie!

338
00:28:28.557 --> 00:28:33.219
If you don't wanna hang around, go back
to your barbecues and your brunches.


339
00:28:33.353 --> 00:28:36.307
We don't have to get the car back.
We can buy a new one.


340
00:28:36.565 --> 00:28:38.557
520, 540,

341
00:28:38.692 --> 00:28:41.265
560, 580, 600.

342
00:28:41.403 --> 00:28:44.854
OK. Now, I need to see
some valid identification


343
00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:47.445
and something showing
you have insurance.


344
00:28:47.576 --> 00:28:51.324
- Can you take my word for it?
- No, I'm sorry. I'm afraid not.


345
00:28:51.788 --> 00:28:53.828
OK.

346
00:28:54.958 --> 00:28:58.541
- How about Mr Franklin's?
- Now we're talking.


347
00:29:14.227 --> 00:29:17.347
Come on, Charlie, talk to me.
What's on your mind?


348
00:29:20.316 --> 00:29:23.768
You wanna know where I got the money
for the car, right?


349
00:29:23.945 --> 00:29:28.025
I wanna know where you got that car,
that you can just leave it like that.


350
00:29:28.158 --> 00:29:30.731
<i>Then I wanna know
where you got the money.</i>


351
00:29:33.955 --> 00:29:38.581
# D
-I
-V
-O
-R
-C
-E

352
00:29:39.002 --> 00:29:42.287
Equal distribution of assets.
It's a popular tune.


353
00:29:43.631 --> 00:29:45.671
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

354
00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:48.340
Don't be sorry. 
I'm not sorry.

355
00:29:50.304 --> 00:29:54.883
Charlie, don't worry about that car.
It was still registered in his name.


356
00:29:55.017 --> 00:29:58.054
You got to stop worrying so much.

357
00:30:07.822 --> 00:30:10.573
- Hi! You guys want a ride?
- Thank you, thank you.


358
00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:12.739
Hop in.

359
00:30:12.910 --> 00:30:15.864
- Here, let me...
- Welcome aboard.


360
00:30:16.372 --> 00:30:18.578
# Wild thing

361
00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:21.540
# You make my heart sing

362
00:30:23.504 --> 00:30:26.789
# You make everything groovy

363
00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:30.340
# Wild thing

364
00:30:33.055 --> 00:30:35.012
# Wild thing

365
00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:37.180
# I think I love you

366
00:30:38.769 --> 00:30:41.260
# But I wanna know for sure

367
00:30:42.690 --> 00:30:45.228
# Come on, hold me tight

368
00:30:47.695 --> 00:30:49.734
# I love you

369
00:31:07.005 --> 00:31:09.045
Thanks for the ride.

370
00:31:12.052 --> 00:31:14.092
Bye, Lulu.

371
00:31:15.222 --> 00:31:17.214
- Thank you!
- Pleasure to meet you.


372
00:31:25.565 --> 00:31:27.605
Thank you, ladies.

373
00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:35.484
Ladies, we need something
for the gentleman here.


374
00:31:38.828 --> 00:31:40.868
Follow me.

375
00:31:48.004 --> 00:31:50.044
Oh, Charlie!

376
00:31:51.007 --> 00:31:53.214
- It's you.
- Forget it.


377
00:31:53.343 --> 00:31:55.170
No. No. I will not buy this.

378
00:31:55.303 --> 00:31:58.090
- Look at this.
- Absolutely, with all certainty, no.


379
00:31:58.223 --> 00:32:02.267
- It brings out the blue in those eyes.
- Yes, but still...


380
00:32:02.393 --> 00:32:04.849
- Ladies, what do you think?
- No.


381
00:32:04.979 --> 00:32:06.889
Very nice.

382
00:32:07.565 --> 00:32:08.596
Oh, God!

383
00:32:08.733 --> 00:32:11.520
If you were my mother
and I presented him as my husband,


384
00:32:11.653 --> 00:32:13.811
- what would you think?
- Very nice.


385
00:32:13.947 --> 00:32:17.944
But I'd get rid of those handcuffs,
if I were you.


386
00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:34.880
- Charlie!
- Oh!


387
00:32:35.718 --> 00:32:37.758
Don't look so surprised.

388
00:32:39.472 --> 00:32:41.678
Get in the car.

389
00:32:55.279 --> 00:32:58.613
- Where are we?
- Come here, Charlie.


390
00:33:00.785 --> 00:33:04.367
- What are you doing?
- I'm setting you free.


391
00:33:04.497 --> 00:33:08.197
- Maybe I don't wanna be free.
- Maybe you're not.


392
00:33:08.334 --> 00:33:09.662
Come on.

393
00:33:10.127 --> 00:33:12.001
Hello!

394
00:33:12.713 --> 00:33:15.797
- Don't call me Lulu. Call me Audrey.
- Audrey?


395
00:33:15.925 --> 00:33:18.925
- Audrey! What a surprise!
- Hi, Mama.


396
00:33:20.721 --> 00:33:23.426
Mom, I want you to meet
my husband Charlie.


397
00:33:23.557 --> 00:33:26.475
- Oh. Well, hello, Charlie.
- Nice to meet you, Mrs, uh...


398
00:33:26.602 --> 00:33:28.393
Just call me Peaches.

399
00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:30.809
- That's her real name.
- Peaches...


400
00:33:43.994 --> 00:33:46.236
- Here you are.
- Thank you.


401
00:33:46.371 --> 00:33:50.072
Charlie, exactly how did y'all decide
to come down here?


402
00:33:51.084 --> 00:33:55.082
Audrey just said "let's go visit
my mother", so here we are.


403
00:33:57.507 --> 00:34:00.876
Audrey is very impulsive.
It's one of the things I like about her.


404
00:34:01.011 --> 00:34:04.296
And, dear, exactly when
did y'all get married?


405
00:34:04.431 --> 00:34:08.096
In September.
We're still newlyweds really.


406
00:34:09.519 --> 00:34:12.473
You'll have to visit us.
We have an extra room.


407
00:34:12.606 --> 00:34:15.144
It's gonna be the baby's room some day.

408
00:34:15.275 --> 00:34:18.644
Charlie fixed it up.
He's really good with his hands.


409
00:34:21.072 --> 00:34:24.856
He wants a big family, but I think
just a boy and a girl would be nice.


410
00:34:24.993 --> 00:34:28.243
- Don't you, honey?
- Whatever you want, honey.


411
00:34:28.371 --> 00:34:32.618
See, Mama? He's just the kind of man
you always said I should marry.


412
00:35:06.325 --> 00:35:10.572
Mama, we're gonna lie down for a bit
cos we've been driving all day.


413
00:35:16.711 --> 00:35:21.005
- Why'd you tell her we were married?
- I wanted to make her happy.


414
00:35:21.132 --> 00:35:25.046
- She doesn't know you were married?
- No. She didn't like him anyway.


415
00:35:25.177 --> 00:35:27.965
Next time, let me know your plans.
I almost lost it.


416
00:35:28.097 --> 00:35:32.426
That was part of the surprise. I wanted
to see if you could think on your feet.


417
00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:34.433
How'd I do?

418
00:35:34.562 --> 00:35:38.891
Like I said, you're a pretty good liar
when you wanna be, Charlie.


419
00:35:49.577 --> 00:35:51.616
Audrey Hankel.

420
00:36:22.734 --> 00:36:28.986
The guy was, like, taking all the way. So
I'm running in like an idiot, and I slide in.


421
00:36:29.116 --> 00:36:33.410
Everybody's so surprised.
The catcher is holding the ball.


422
00:36:33.537 --> 00:36:36.538
I slide home, I steal home,
we win the game.


423
00:36:37.207 --> 00:36:38.582
Oh, God, it was great!

424
00:36:38.709 --> 00:36:42.042
Well, I'm glad it was
such a good game for you.


425
00:36:42.337 --> 00:36:46.465
- This is good food too.
- Well, I expect you to eat it all up then.


426
00:36:49.553 --> 00:36:52.589
You've got a real wife somewhere,
don't you, Charlie?


427
00:36:52.722 --> 00:36:56.257
Uh, well,
that's a little complicated, Peaches.


428
00:36:56.393 --> 00:36:59.678
- Do you love my daughter?
- I just met her recently.


429
00:36:59.813 --> 00:37:01.852
It's kinda hard to...

430
00:37:02.232 --> 00:37:07.143
You take care then.
She's got some strange notions about life.


431
00:37:07.278 --> 00:37:09.152
Yep. I know.

432
00:37:12.742 --> 00:37:14.284
Oh, my gosh!

433
00:37:14.536 --> 00:37:17.655
I had this dress in high school.
Mama saves everything.


434
00:37:17.789 --> 00:37:20.280
- Don't you, Mama?
- Of course I do.


435
00:37:20.708 --> 00:37:25.536
We packed a suitcase and I left it sitting
right by the door. I'm glad I had this dress.


436
00:37:25.672 --> 00:37:30.713
But poor Charlie's gotta wear what he's
got on the whole weekend. Poor baby.


437
00:37:37.433 --> 00:37:39.390
Goodbye, Mama.

438
00:37:39.519 --> 00:37:43.018
We'll try and get down more often.
Charlie's job keeps him so busy.


439
00:37:43.147 --> 00:37:46.397
Oh, I understand, dear.
Just come when you can.


440
00:37:47.235 --> 00:37:49.144
- Give her a kiss.
- Goodbye, Peaches.


441
00:37:49.278 --> 00:37:52.528
Come on. She's my mama, Charlie.
Give her a kiss.


442
00:37:54.158 --> 00:37:56.696
- Bye, Charlie.
- Thank you for the meal. It was...


443
00:37:56.828 --> 00:37:58.619
- Bye, Max
- Heads up, Max.


444
00:37:58.746 --> 00:38:02.411
- I hope things work out for you, Charlie.
- Good luck to you too!


445
00:38:02.542 --> 00:38:04.830
It was wonderful meeting you, Peaches.

446
00:38:04.961 --> 00:38:07.000
Here, let me...

447
00:38:12.343 --> 00:38:14.382
Come on! Let's go.

448
00:38:17.848 --> 00:38:20.683
- You wanna tell me where we're going?
- No.


449
00:38:22.603 --> 00:38:24.809
<i>-So long!
- Bye.</i>


450
00:38:24.939 --> 00:38:26.896
I love you, Mama.

451
00:38:27.024 --> 00:38:28.566
<i># Ever fallen in love</i>

452
00:38:28.692 --> 00:38:30.317
<i># In love with someone</i>

453
00:38:30.444 --> 00:38:32.069
<i># Ever fallen in love</i>

454
00:38:32.196 --> 00:38:35.280

455
00:38:37.451 --> 00:38:39.776
- Jesus, what's this?
- Get ready, Charlie.


456
00:38:40.329 --> 00:38:42.784
My high school reunion.
God, I'm so nervous.


457
00:38:42.915 --> 00:38:44.954
Are you kidding me?

458
00:38:47.419 --> 00:38:50.586
Wait, wait, wait!
Who am I supposed to be?


459
00:38:51.757 --> 00:38:53.796
- Oh!
- OK.


460
00:39:03.227 --> 00:39:05.682
Am I supposed to sign in here?

461
00:39:06.980 --> 00:39:09.471
- Audrey Hankel?
- Yeah.


462
00:39:09.775 --> 00:39:11.648
Remember me? Donna Penski?

463
00:39:11.985 --> 00:39:14.310
- Yeah, sure, Donna. How are you?
- Fine.


464
00:39:14.446 --> 00:39:16.937
Audrey! James. 
James Williams.

465
00:39:17.199 --> 00:39:18.693
James! Hi!

466
00:39:18.825 --> 00:39:21.495
How you doin'?
This is my husband Charlie.


467
00:39:21.703 --> 00:39:24.277
- Hello, James.
- Pleased to meet you, Charlie.


468
00:39:24.414 --> 00:39:27.332
We have a booklet
with the names and addresses


469
00:39:27.459 --> 00:39:30.032
of all the people
who weren't able to make it tonight.


470
00:39:30.170 --> 00:39:31.545
Oh, really?

471
00:39:31.671 --> 00:39:33.664
Audrey! Smile, please.

472
00:39:35.717 --> 00:39:37.508
Thank you.

473
00:39:37.636 --> 00:39:41.847
- I bet you've got kids, don't you?
- Mm-hm. Two, a boy and a girl.


474
00:39:41.973 --> 00:39:44.429
Oh, that's nice. 
What are their names?

475
00:39:45.143 --> 00:39:47.183
Their names?

476
00:39:48.605 --> 00:39:51.060
- Scott and Leslie.
- Scott and Leslie.


477
00:39:52.525 --> 00:39:55.692
# I thought love
was only true in fairy tales


478
00:39:56.529 --> 00:39:58.901
# Meant for someone
else and not for me

479
00:40:00.867 --> 00:40:02.860
# Love was out to get me

480
00:40:02.994 --> 00:40:04.785
# That's the way it seemed

481
00:40:04.913 --> 00:40:07.404
# Disappointments haunted all my dreams

482
00:40:07.957 --> 00:40:09.997
# Then I saw her face

483
00:40:10.293 --> 00:40:12.202
# Now I'm a believer

484
00:40:12.337 --> 00:40:14.210
# Not a trace

485
00:40:14.339 --> 00:40:16.248
# Of doubt in my mind

486
00:40:16.382 --> 00:40:18.422
# I'm in love

487
00:40:18.676 --> 00:40:21.962
# I'm a believer
I just couldn't leave her if I tried


488
00:40:27.769 --> 00:40:29.642
# What's the use in tryin'?

489
00:40:29.771 --> 00:40:31.597
# All you get is pain

490
00:40:31.731 --> 00:40:33.937
# When I needed sunshine, I got rain

491
00:40:34.901 --> 00:40:36.940
Whooo!

492
00:40:37.987 --> 00:40:39.980
# I'm a believer

493
00:40:40.114 --> 00:40:41.941
# I'm a believer

494
00:40:42.074 --> 00:40:43.984
# I'm a believer

495
00:40:44.118 --> 00:40:46.158
# I'm a believer

496
00:40:52.084 --> 00:40:54.124
I want a big Badger yell.

497
00:40:54.420 --> 00:40:56.459
Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo!

498
00:40:57.298 --> 00:40:59.171
That guy's in my office!

499
00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:02.087
I've always been an introverted, shy guy.

500
00:41:02.887 --> 00:41:04.713
Charles Driggs!

501
00:41:04.847 --> 00:41:08.761
Ah! God! No!
Uh, uh, uh... Just let me do the talking.


502
00:41:08.893 --> 00:41:11.099
- Larry!
- What the hell are you doing here?


503
00:41:11.228 --> 00:41:14.265
I thought you never
got out of the office!

504
00:41:14.398 --> 00:41:18.147
You remember my wife Peggy?
You met Charles at the Christmas party.


505
00:41:18.277 --> 00:41:21.646
Congrats on that promotion.
You really deserve it.


506
00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:25.860
- I knew you'd go right to the top.
- Thanks. That's nice of you to say.


507
00:41:25.993 --> 00:41:28.745
I bet you say that
to all the new VPs.

508
00:41:28.871 --> 00:41:31.658
Uh, this is Audrey.
We've known each other for...


509
00:41:31.790 --> 00:41:32.905
We're lovers.

510
00:41:33.041 --> 00:41:36.410
Only in the sense
that all human beings are... lovers.


511
00:41:36.545 --> 00:41:38.668
Audrey Driggs?

512
00:41:38.797 --> 00:41:41.632
I had to take his
name for the baby's sake.

513
00:41:41.758 --> 00:41:44.962
<i>- You're having his child?
- I think it's his child.</i>


514
00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:48.922
Larry works in accounting,
down the hall from me, right?


515
00:41:49.057 --> 00:41:52.722
Is this the guy who would've wondered
why you were using company plastic


516
00:41:52.853 --> 00:41:55.889
yesterday afternoon
in that motel in New Jersey?


517
00:41:56.898 --> 00:42:01.276
Hell, Charles, we could've covered that.
Just let me know next time.


518
00:42:02.112 --> 00:42:04.151
See?

519
00:42:04.322 --> 00:42:05.900
This is my wife Peggy.

520
00:42:06.032 --> 00:42:09.982
We went to school together, Larry.
Remember? It's our reunion.


521
00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:12.159
- Hello, Audrey.
- Hi.


522
00:42:15.292 --> 00:42:18.328
<i>
- Reunions are fun, aren't they?</i>

523
00:42:18.461 --> 00:42:20.335
Come on, Larry.

524
00:42:20.463 --> 00:42:22.503
Will you excuse us?

525
00:42:23.425 --> 00:42:25.916
Driggs, I didn't think
you had it in you.

526
00:42:26.303 --> 00:42:28.342
Oh-ho...

527
00:42:32.809 --> 00:42:35.264
- Thank you.
- Charlie!


528
00:42:35.645 --> 00:42:38.017
- Charlie, relax.
- Relax?


529
00:42:38.898 --> 00:42:43.359
What were you doing over there?
That guy works in my office.


530
00:42:43.486 --> 00:42:48.907
If he opens his mouth about any of this,
and, believe me, he will, I'm ruined.


531
00:42:49.033 --> 00:42:51.156
Charlie, you are vice president.

532
00:42:52.704 --> 00:42:57.164
Did you see the look on that guy's face?
He thinks you're a hero.


533
00:43:09.053 --> 00:43:11.093
Charlie, what's wrong?

534
00:43:11.305 --> 00:43:15.635
I'll tell you what's wrong. Company
plastic. Valid company credit cards.


535
00:43:15.768 --> 00:43:18.639
They were in my wallet.
It was in my jacket. It's gone.


536
00:43:18.771 --> 00:43:22.685
My MCI number, my access card
to get me into my own building!


537
00:43:22.817 --> 00:43:27.562
I mean, God knows who's got them!
My Christmas Club voucher... Oh, crap!


538
00:43:27.822 --> 00:43:30.657
- If I don't get it back, you know what?
- What?


539
00:43:33.035 --> 00:43:35.075
I'm fucked!

540
00:43:37.331 --> 00:43:39.371
Charlie, I got it.

541
00:43:40.501 --> 00:43:42.540
I got your wallet.

542
00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:44.580
You got my wallet?

543
00:43:44.713 --> 00:43:48.047
It fell out of your
jacket and I picked it up.

544
00:43:50.636 --> 00:43:54.052
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I'm telling you now.


545
00:43:54.556 --> 00:43:57.012
It's in the glove compartment.

546
00:43:59.728 --> 00:44:01.768
Lulu, look. Uh...

547
00:44:05.192 --> 00:44:09.521
God, you're a great girl. You got
a few problems, but you're a great girl.


548
00:44:09.655 --> 00:44:13.902
And you're loaded with potential.
But you're too much for me.


549
00:44:14.034 --> 00:44:16.572
I can't handle this.

550
00:44:16.703 --> 00:44:21.698
Let me get my wallet and I'll catch a bus
and go back to my boring, very safe life.


551
00:44:22.042 --> 00:44:23.702
While I've still got one.

552
00:44:23.835 --> 00:44:28.213
Charlie, I'm sorry. I didn't think
it was that important. I'm sorry.


553
00:44:29.091 --> 00:44:31.332
You believe me, don't you?

554
00:44:31.468 --> 00:44:33.508
Yeah, yeah, course I do.

555
00:44:34.388 --> 00:44:38.848
Tomorrow you're gonna wake up,
you're still gonna be Charlie Driggs.


556
00:44:39.059 --> 00:44:41.632
And this'll all be over and done with.

557
00:44:42.646 --> 00:44:45.351
So why don't we
enjoy it while we can.

558
00:44:45.941 --> 00:44:48.610
And then tomorrow, no more Lulu.

559
00:44:52.155 --> 00:44:54.195
Unless you really wanna go.

560
00:44:55.158 --> 00:44:57.198
Then go.

561
00:45:32.820 --> 00:45:34.860
# I'll be there

562
00:45:35.823 --> 00:45:37.863
# Any time

563
00:45:38.368 --> 00:45:40.407
# You need me

564
00:45:40.578 --> 00:45:42.618
# By your side

565
00:45:43.247 --> 00:45:46.165
# To dry away

566
00:45:47.627 --> 00:45:51.411
# Every teardrop that you cry

567
00:45:52.048 --> 00:45:55.417
# And if he ever leaves you blue

568
00:45:57.220 --> 00:45:59.046
# Just remember

569
00:45:59.180 --> 00:46:00.804
# I love you

570
00:46:00.932 --> 00:46:02.971
# And I'll be there

571
00:46:03.893 --> 00:46:08.222
# Before the next teardrop falls

572
00:46:10.441 --> 00:46:12.480
# And I'll be there

573
00:46:13.361 --> 00:46:15.400
# Before the next

574
00:46:15.863 --> 00:46:19.232
# Teardrop falls

575
00:46:24.121 --> 00:46:27.039
The Feelies! The Feelies!
Come on! Thank you!


576
00:46:28.751 --> 00:46:31.420
You want something... from the bar?

577
00:46:32.421 --> 00:46:34.877
I sure would love a soda.

578
00:46:36.008 --> 00:46:39.293
I'm gonna get some air.
I'll be outside, over there.


579
00:46:41.347 --> 00:46:43.386
OK?

580
00:47:02.367 --> 00:47:04.443
If I could just... 
Is it possible?

581
00:47:04.578 --> 00:47:06.654
Got a light?

582
00:47:06.788 --> 00:47:10.038
Uh... Well, let me... No, 
I don't think so.

583
00:47:10.167 --> 00:47:13.168
I'm Irene. I don't believe in name tags.

584
00:47:13.295 --> 00:47:16.165
Oh. Right. Charlie. I, uh...

585
00:47:16.631 --> 00:47:20.581
never had many concrete convictions
about them one way or another.


586
00:47:20.719 --> 00:47:23.886
- You're Audrey's husband, aren't you?
- Uh... Yeah.


587
00:47:24.014 --> 00:47:27.098
Yeah? You don't sound too convinced.

588
00:47:27.225 --> 00:47:31.140
I can hardly believe it myself.
We haven't known each other long.


589
00:47:31.271 --> 00:47:35.518
- You don't exactly seem her type.
- Yeah, well, what can I tell you?


590
00:47:35.901 --> 00:47:39.815
Hi, Audrey.
Check out Charlie at the end of the bar.


591
00:47:40.488 --> 00:47:44.071
Dated, married, church wedding,
you know... And, uh...


592
00:47:44.951 --> 00:47:47.703
I had no idea
Charles had such a way with the ladies.


593
00:47:47.829 --> 00:47:49.240
Neither did he.

594
00:47:49.372 --> 00:47:51.946
- I work in the city.
- Doing what?


595
00:47:52.667 --> 00:47:56.451
You seem overly interested
in Audrey and me.


596
00:47:56.588 --> 00:47:58.627
We're old friends.

597
00:48:07.974 --> 00:48:10.013
Can I get a soda? 
Can I get a soda?

598
00:48:11.728 --> 00:48:14.301
Charlie?
I get up to New York once in a while.


599
00:48:14.439 --> 00:48:16.562
- What?
- I get up to New York once in a while.


600
00:48:16.691 --> 00:48:17.521
- Yeah?
- Yeah.


601
00:48:17.650 --> 00:48:19.607
- Like to have a drink with me?
- What?


602
00:48:19.736 --> 00:48:21.858
Wanna have a drink in New York?

603
00:48:21.988 --> 00:48:26.116
Yeah. No! No. I'm married.
I got... I'm a married man.


604
00:48:27.118 --> 00:48:28.577
Listen...

605
00:48:28.703 --> 00:48:31.787
Enjoy the reunion, all right?
Nice meeting you.


606
00:48:59.984 --> 00:49:03.768
# Fame, makes a man take things over

607
00:49:04.363 --> 00:49:07.697
# Fame, lets him loose
and hard to swallow


608
00:49:08.242 --> 00:49:12.026
# Fame, puts you there
where things are hollow


609
00:49:12.538 --> 00:49:14.577
# Fame

610
00:49:52.077 --> 00:49:55.446
# Fame, what you
like is in the limo

611
00:49:56.206 --> 00:49:59.705
# Fame, what you get is no tomorrow

612
00:50:00.335 --> 00:50:03.669
# Fame, what you need
you have to borrow


613
00:50:04.089 --> 00:50:06.128
# Fame

614
00:50:51.427 --> 00:50:53.467
<i>Oh, God!</i>

615
00:51:15.618 --> 00:51:17.657
Hi, baby. Surprise!

616
00:51:18.120 --> 00:51:19.745
Hi, Charlie.

617
00:51:19.872 --> 00:51:22.161
- Let's go.
- Why? What's wrong?


618
00:51:22.291 --> 00:51:24.331
Let's just go.

619
00:51:42.895 --> 00:51:45.564
Charles, hey. Are you
gonna be around tomorrow?


620
00:51:45.689 --> 00:51:48.359
Uh... we kind of wanna
get an early start back.


621
00:51:48.484 --> 00:51:50.476
- How about brunch?
- Uh, how about brunch?


622
00:51:50.611 --> 00:51:54.988
- Hi there!
- Hi. Charles Driggs. Audrey's husband.


623
00:51:55.115 --> 00:51:58.864
Well, Charlie, pleased to meet you.
I'm Ray. This is Irene.


624
00:51:59.119 --> 00:52:00.530
Yeah, we've met.

625
00:52:00.663 --> 00:52:03.616
- Hi. I'm Larry Dillman.
- Hi. I'm Ray. This is Irene.


626
00:52:03.749 --> 00:52:07.082
Irene, hi. This is Chloe
and my wife Peggy. Ray and Irene.


627
00:52:07.211 --> 00:52:07.875
Hi.

628
00:52:08.003 --> 00:52:10.921
Well, we know old Peg. Don't we, Peg?

629
00:52:11.131 --> 00:52:12.709
Hi, Ray.

630
00:52:13.133 --> 00:52:17.676
- Charles and I work together in New York.
- Really? Ain't that somethin'?


631
00:52:17.804 --> 00:52:21.339
- Slavin' away over the old...
- Here he comes now!


632
00:52:21.475 --> 00:52:24.096
Haven't seen you in a while, Audrey.

633
00:52:24.227 --> 00:52:28.011
- Seems like only yesterday, Ray.
- How time changes things.


634
00:52:28.148 --> 00:52:31.599
- Oh, too true.
- That's what life's all about, huh?


635
00:52:31.735 --> 00:52:34.440
Speaking of changing things,
we have to go.


636
00:52:34.571 --> 00:52:37.607
- See you all in ten years.
- OK.


637
00:52:37.741 --> 00:52:39.983
- Take care, Charlie.
- Nice to meet you.


638
00:52:40.118 --> 00:52:44.198
<i>- Listen, shall we... OK, let's do it.
- Bye, Peg. Bye, Larry.</i>


639
00:52:44.331 --> 00:52:46.952
Boy, there's a guy
who landed on his feet.

640
00:52:47.083 --> 00:52:48.246
How's that?

641
00:52:48.376 --> 00:52:52.754
Nine months ago, his wife takes the kids
and runs off with the family dentist.


642
00:52:52.881 --> 00:52:55.716
It's the best thing
that ever happened to him.


643
00:52:55.842 --> 00:52:57.882
Yeah, I believe that.

644
00:53:02.724 --> 00:53:05.429
- Damn it!
- Don't flood it.


645
00:53:08.646 --> 00:53:09.975
Hi, you all!

646
00:53:10.106 --> 00:53:14.602
- How'd you get out here so fast?
- Always keep 'em guessing, Charlie.


647
00:53:14.736 --> 00:53:17.061
I thought we could have a drink together.

648
00:53:17.197 --> 00:53:20.032
The party's over here.
We still got time for a quick one.


649
00:53:20.158 --> 00:53:22.447
Thanks, but no thanks, Ray.

650
00:53:22.577 --> 00:53:24.616
Oh, come on!

651
00:53:25.204 --> 00:53:27.244
It'll be fun.

652
00:53:27.707 --> 00:53:31.621
- You don't mind, do you, Charlie?
- No, it's OK with me. Honey?


653
00:53:32.378 --> 00:53:34.703
Whaddaya say, Audrey? One drink?

654
00:53:35.173 --> 00:53:40.214
You don't want me to tell Charlie
how you spent your free periods, do ya?


655
00:53:41.220 --> 00:53:44.340
- Come on! One drink!
- OK, one drink.


656
00:53:44.474 --> 00:53:47.344
All right! I'll drive, Charlie!

657
00:53:57.778 --> 00:54:00.234
Hey, Charlie, how do you like this baby?

658
00:54:00.364 --> 00:54:02.321
- Oh, God, it's a beauty, Ray.
- Yeah.


659
00:54:02.450 --> 00:54:06.399
- They don't make 'em like this any more.
- Boy, this baby travels.


660
00:54:07.204 --> 00:54:10.122
- What do you drive?
- I, uh... a Ford station wagon.


661
00:54:10.249 --> 00:54:12.289
A station wagon? Oh!

662
00:54:21.260 --> 00:54:23.466
Hey, guys! How ya doin', huh?

663
00:54:23.596 --> 00:54:27.011
<i>Larry, baby!
- We're going for pizza. Wanna come?</i>


664
00:54:27.141 --> 00:54:29.299
- Uh... pizza?
- I don't want no pizza.


665
00:54:29.435 --> 00:54:32.352
No, no, we can't. 
We've made other plans.

666
00:54:32.646 --> 00:54:37.355
Sure. Anyway, see you Monday morning,
Mr Vice President, huh?


667
00:54:37.860 --> 00:54:39.899
OK! See ya!

668
00:54:44.450 --> 00:54:46.489
He'll get in trouble with those guys.

669
00:54:50.914 --> 00:54:54.994
- So you're a vice president, huh?
- Yep. Just got promoted.


670
00:54:56.128 --> 00:54:59.212
Well, we're gonna have to make this
a night to remember.


671
00:54:59.339 --> 00:55:01.961
<i># Dressed in a white shirt</i>

672
00:55:02.551 --> 00:55:05.421
<i># With my hair combed straight</i>

673
00:55:05.762 --> 00:55:07.802
<i># Here in my black shoes...</i>

674
00:55:07.931 --> 00:55:09.425
Hoo!

675
00:55:16.189 --> 00:55:18.894
Irene, why don't you and Charlie
get us some six packs?


676
00:55:19.025 --> 00:55:20.983
- Yeah, come on, Irene.
- Ray!


677
00:55:21.111 --> 00:55:24.729
Where are your manners?
It's your town. Why don't you go?


678
00:55:26.533 --> 00:55:27.908
I'll go.

679
00:55:28.034 --> 00:55:29.410
Let him go.

680
00:55:29.536 --> 00:55:30.995
I'll go.

681
00:55:32.330 --> 00:55:35.616
- Irene, why don't you go with her?
- I'll go with her.


682
00:55:40.880 --> 00:55:42.920
Ooooh-eee!

683
00:55:44.551 --> 00:55:46.590
Look at that Audrey.

684
00:55:46.970 --> 00:55:49.377
She is a work of art, huh?

685
00:55:49.514 --> 00:55:51.637
Oh, yeah.

686
00:55:51.933 --> 00:55:55.136
- You're a lucky man, Charlie.
- Oh, don't I know it!


687
00:55:55.979 --> 00:56:00.439
- How long have you been married?
- What is it now? A year ago, September.


688
00:56:00.567 --> 00:56:02.773
- Still newlyweds, really.
- Yeah?


689
00:56:02.902 --> 00:56:07.231
- You know...
- That's wonderful. It really is.


690
00:56:08.324 --> 00:56:12.536
- Where you living these days?
- We got a nice place out in Long Island.


691
00:56:12.662 --> 00:56:15.663
- Yeah? Where?
- Stony Brook.


692
00:56:16.207 --> 00:56:19.457
- I'm fixing a room up for the kids...
- You got kids?


693
00:56:19.585 --> 00:56:23.286
- Well, we intend to have them.
- Yeah? That's great.


694
00:56:26.384 --> 00:56:31.093
- Audrey was a little wild in high school.
- Oh, well, yes, I can believe that!


695
00:56:31.222 --> 00:56:33.629
But I knew
she'd get herself together one day.


696
00:56:33.766 --> 00:56:35.842
Oh... Thank you, Ray.

697
00:56:36.185 --> 00:56:38.676
Irene, how long has he been in town?

698
00:56:38.813 --> 00:56:41.138
- I don't know.
- When did he get out?


699
00:56:41.274 --> 00:56:42.602
I don't know!

700
00:56:42.733 --> 00:56:45.485
- Come on, Irene!
- I swear to God, I don't know.


701
00:56:45.611 --> 00:56:48.897
I was just as surprised as you were
when he showed up.


702
00:56:49.031 --> 00:56:51.071
Oh, God.

703
00:56:51.534 --> 00:56:54.072
I wonder what they're talking about.

704
00:56:54.203 --> 00:56:56.492
Now there's a question.

705
00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:03.369
- I shouldn't be asking you this...
- No, no, no. Anything.


706
00:57:03.504 --> 00:57:04.618
Yeah?

707
00:57:04.755 --> 00:57:07.673
Audrey was the hottest thing in school.

708
00:57:09.260 --> 00:57:12.711
And I was wondering,
what is she really like?


709
00:57:15.933 --> 00:57:18.056
What a gal, Ray. 
I mean, what a gal!

710
00:57:18.185 --> 00:57:21.388
She is... She's impulsive and...
her imagination...


711
00:57:21.522 --> 00:57:24.523
No, no, no! I mean in bed.

712
00:57:25.526 --> 00:57:27.399
Oh!

713
00:57:27.528 --> 00:57:29.567
What am I doing?

714
00:57:30.155 --> 00:57:33.939
Oh, God! Uh... well, she's, uh...

715
00:57:34.201 --> 00:57:39.077
Come on, Charlie, you gotta admit she
looks like she could fuck you right in half.


716
00:57:39.206 --> 00:57:44.662
- I mean, just fuck you to pieces.
- Ray, there's no call for that kind of talk.


717
00:57:49.466 --> 00:57:51.506
You're right.

718
00:57:51.927 --> 00:57:53.966
You're right.

719
00:57:54.679 --> 00:57:56.506
I understand.

720
00:57:57.849 --> 00:57:59.889
Sorry, Charlie.

721
00:58:00.018 --> 00:58:01.761
No...

722
00:58:01.895 --> 00:58:03.934
Sorry, Charlie.

723
00:58:05.482 --> 00:58:07.356
Come on...

724
00:58:08.235 --> 00:58:10.227
We friends?

725
00:58:10.362 --> 00:58:12.401
Sure. Oh, yeah.

726
00:58:12.989 --> 00:58:14.898
OK.

727
00:58:15.033 --> 00:58:18.236
I'm gonna go get me some smokes.
I'll be right back.


728
00:58:20.497 --> 00:58:24.031
You're a good guy, Charlie.
I don't care what they say.


729
00:58:31.841 --> 00:58:34.130
Irene, Charlie's lonely out there.

730
00:58:35.678 --> 00:58:38.513
Why don't you give us
a coupla minutes alone?


731
00:58:39.807 --> 00:58:42.014
Go on! Go keep him company.

732
00:58:42.143 --> 00:58:44.978
- I got nothing to say to you, Ray.
- Come here!


733
00:58:48.942 --> 00:58:51.563
I was hoping you'd show up tonight.

734
00:58:52.320 --> 00:58:55.440
- When'd you get out?
- I've been lookin' for you.


735
00:58:55.990 --> 00:58:57.864
How did you get out, Ray?

736
00:58:57.992 --> 00:59:01.076
- Who's this Charlie guy?
- He's nobody. I just met him.


737
00:59:01.204 --> 00:59:05.949
Oh, yeah? He's out there braggin'
about what a great piece of ass you are.


738
00:59:06.083 --> 00:59:08.076
Bullshit, Ray. You're sick.

739
00:59:08.211 --> 00:59:10.702
He's too nice
to say something like that.


740
00:59:10.838 --> 00:59:11.917
Audrey!

741
00:59:13.382 --> 00:59:15.790
I missed you so goddamn much!

742
00:59:17.678 --> 00:59:20.430
- Every sweet little part of you.
- Don't...


743
00:59:21.557 --> 00:59:23.965
You should've never quit me, baby.

744
00:59:24.101 --> 00:59:27.351
I tried to explain to you
in the last letter I wrote you.


745
00:59:27.480 --> 00:59:31.727
Write me?! Fuck, Audrey! I'm up
for a nickel and all you can do is write?!


746
00:59:31.859 --> 00:59:34.148
I don't wanna talk about it, Ray.

747
00:59:34.278 --> 00:59:39.154
I said I'd have one drink with you.
But it's over. Remember that, OK?


748
00:59:45.164 --> 00:59:48.414
Are you saying
that you don't love me any more?


749
00:59:49.960 --> 00:59:52.000
Is that what you're saying?

750
00:59:53.547 --> 00:59:56.465
- Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
- Yeah, right.


751
01:00:05.809 --> 01:00:08.561
Hey, Charlie's got a beer.
Where's my beer?


752
01:00:08.687 --> 01:00:13.396
- Right here.
- Aah... Damn! I forgot to get cigarettes.


753
01:00:13.525 --> 01:00:16.016
Can you get me some cigarettes,
please? Please?


754
01:00:16.153 --> 01:00:18.311
Sure. There ya go.

755
01:00:19.281 --> 01:00:21.439
Thanks, Irene. 
You're all right.

756
01:00:24.202 --> 01:00:26.954
- Hurry up, Irene.
- Oh, yeah.


757
01:00:27.581 --> 01:00:29.573
Charlie, watch this.

758
01:00:29.708 --> 01:00:32.281
<i>Ray, wait! Ray!</i>

759
01:00:32.419 --> 01:00:34.826
- What are you doin', Ray?
- What's it look like?


760
01:00:34.963 --> 01:00:37.501
- Irene!
- Wait, there's Irene!


761
01:00:43.013 --> 01:00:45.052
<i>She's a big girl. 
She'll be OK.</i>

762
01:00:45.182 --> 01:00:50.520
Besides, this is your night to celebrate.
I thought I'd make it just the three of us.


763
01:00:50.645 --> 01:00:52.970
Come on, hop up in front. Come on!

764
01:00:53.106 --> 01:00:56.309
- Yeah, well, all right, Ray.
- Come on. There ya go.


765
01:00:56.609 --> 01:00:58.686
- Come on, Audrey.
- No.


766
01:00:58.820 --> 01:01:00.943
Well, looks like it's you and me, pal.

767
01:01:01.072 --> 01:01:03.742
# Goodnight, Irene...

768
01:01:18.631 --> 01:01:21.087
What are we stoppin' for now?

769
01:01:22.510 --> 01:01:25.084
Still gotta get my smokes, remember?

770
01:01:25.221 --> 01:01:28.720
Come on, Charlie.
I wanna show you something.


771
01:01:30.143 --> 01:01:33.512
Oh, boy.
I'm gonna grab some more beverages.


772
01:01:34.439 --> 01:01:36.515
- You want anything?
- Stay here with me.


773
01:01:36.649 --> 01:01:40.184
Audrey, I'll leave the radio on.
You don't think she'd leave us, do you?


774
01:01:40.319 --> 01:01:42.645
No. You wouldn't do that, would you?

775
01:01:42.780 --> 01:01:46.564
- Come on. I wanna show you something.
- Great.


776
01:01:47.577 --> 01:01:49.616
Take it easy.

777
01:01:54.041 --> 01:01:55.121
- Charlie?
- Yeah?


778
01:01:55.251 --> 01:01:58.869
- Ever been on TV?
- No, Ray. I've never been on television.


779
01:01:59.005 --> 01:02:00.796
- Here's your chance.
- Why? What?


780
01:02:00.923 --> 01:02:04.791
- You're new vice president, huh?
- I am the new VP. Don't you forget it.


781
01:02:04.927 --> 01:02:07.133
All right. Well, make a speech.

782
01:02:07.638 --> 01:02:09.678
Oh, look at that!

783
01:02:10.099 --> 01:02:12.138
- You're on, slick.
- Yeah.


784
01:02:12.810 --> 01:02:14.388
Uh...

785
01:02:14.645 --> 01:02:16.519
Hello! Hey! Hey!

786
01:02:16.647 --> 01:02:17.927
- Hello.
- How are you?


787
01:02:18.065 --> 01:02:20.638
- What can I do for you?
- Let me have a pack of Marlboros.


788
01:02:20.776 --> 01:02:23.148
Marlboros. Will that be all?

789
01:02:23.279 --> 01:02:27.146
<i>.. to Larry Dillman,
a man whose discretion</i>


790
01:02:27.283 --> 01:02:30.983
is exceeded only
by his bad taste in suits.


791
01:02:31.245 --> 01:02:33.202
Thank you. Thank you very much.

792
01:02:33.330 --> 01:02:35.239
Thank you. Sit down!

793
01:02:35.374 --> 01:02:37.663
Please, sit down.

794
01:02:38.085 --> 01:02:39.663
I don't think we got Marlboros.

795
01:02:39.795 --> 01:02:44.789
...thanks to my wonderful wife Audrey,
who has stood by me through...


796
01:02:46.218 --> 01:02:46.882
Wow!

797
01:02:47.010 --> 01:02:48.968
Hey!

798
01:02:49.096 --> 01:02:52.547
Jesus Christ! Ray, what are you? Oh!

799
01:02:53.725 --> 01:02:55.517
You OK?

800
01:02:57.813 --> 01:02:59.852
Bastard, Ray!

801
01:03:11.660 --> 01:03:13.699
Are you all right, Charlie?

802
01:03:13.829 --> 01:03:15.157
Get up! Get up!

803
01:03:16.039 --> 01:03:17.699
Ray, goddamn you!

804
01:03:17.833 --> 01:03:19.872
Just shut up, Audrey!

805
01:03:50.448 --> 01:03:53.568
I'm gonna tell you something, Charlie.

806
01:03:53.701 --> 01:03:56.323
When I used to
do this for a living,

807
01:03:56.454 --> 01:03:59.740
I used to pull a
job at some liquor store,

808
01:03:59.874 --> 01:04:03.290
run around the corner,
pull off the ski mask I was wearing,


809
01:04:03.419 --> 01:04:08.627
put on a different coat and walk
right back into the place I just robbed.


810
01:04:08.758 --> 01:04:13.503
Man, it was wild! They'd be so flipped out,
they wouldn't know their own mothers.


811
01:04:13.638 --> 01:04:18.098
I'd be standing there when they described
what happened and who robbed 'em.


812
01:04:18.226 --> 01:04:23.267
Half the time, they thought
it was some spook that did it.


813
01:04:23.397 --> 01:04:26.019
They'll see your face
on the videotape, pal.


814
01:04:26.150 --> 01:04:28.558
It just might be you they get.

815
01:04:58.349 --> 01:05:00.388
Come on! Come on, move it!

816
01:05:16.158 --> 01:05:20.701
OK, boys and girls. Let's play
a little game of true confessions.


817
01:05:20.829 --> 01:05:24.578
- Get away from him. Just get away.
- Just checking his nose.


818
01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:30.164
Now I know you two
can't really be married.


819
01:05:30.297 --> 01:05:32.040
I haven't seen you in a while,

820
01:05:32.174 --> 01:05:35.459
but they woulda sent me papers
if you were divorcing me.


821
01:05:36.595 --> 01:05:41.056
So why don't you two lovebirds
just tell me what the fuck is goin' on?


822
01:05:43.226 --> 01:05:44.934
Tell me, goddammit!

823
01:05:45.062 --> 01:05:48.016
<i>-Knock it off in there!
- You knock it the fuck off!</i>


824
01:05:48.148 --> 01:05:51.481
Stop it, Ray! Cut
it out! Ray, stop it!

825
01:05:52.152 --> 01:05:54.191
I'll tell you, all right?

826
01:05:55.530 --> 01:05:59.943
He's just a guy. I picked him up
on the street in New York.


827
01:06:01.328 --> 01:06:07.164
We pretended to be married for Mama,
and it just carried over to the reunion.


828
01:06:07.292 --> 01:06:10.791
The guy's got a real wife
and two real children.


829
01:06:10.921 --> 01:06:13.874
- It's just a joke that got outta hand.
- Bullshit!


830
01:06:14.007 --> 01:06:15.834
Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit!

831
01:06:15.967 --> 01:06:20.261
<i>- Shut up in there!
- You shut the fuck up, goddammit!</i>

832
01:06:39.240 --> 01:06:41.280
Ray...

833
01:06:43.244 --> 01:06:47.242
I met him yesterday.
There's nothing going on.


834
01:06:47.373 --> 01:06:49.532
Nothing. OK?

835
01:06:49.667 --> 01:06:53.451
Look at you.
You look like a goddamn TV show.


836
01:06:54.964 --> 01:06:56.873
Just like he does.

837
01:06:57.008 --> 01:06:59.925
# Da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da.

838
01:07:01.888 --> 01:07:05.837
I may not be educated,
like Charlie-boy there,


839
01:07:05.975 --> 01:07:08.015
but I am not stupid.

840
01:07:08.186 --> 01:07:10.308
She's telling you the truth, Ray.

841
01:07:10.646 --> 01:07:12.686
Is she?

842
01:07:14.358 --> 01:07:16.730
Is she telling me the truth, Charlie?

843
01:07:17.445 --> 01:07:18.440
Yes.

844
01:07:18.821 --> 01:07:20.399
Yeah? Here...

845
01:07:20.656 --> 01:07:23.325
Ray, you're making a big deal
out of nothing!


846
01:07:23.451 --> 01:07:27.400
- I'm sorry I lied to you, Charlie!
- You're still lying!


847
01:07:27.538 --> 01:07:30.492
I know for a fact
that your friend isn't married.


848
01:07:30.791 --> 01:07:34.160
- His wife left him because of you.
- What? What?!


849
01:07:34.295 --> 01:07:35.955
Are you out of your mind?!

850
01:07:36.088 --> 01:07:39.006
I only met him yesterday!

851
01:07:39.133 --> 01:07:42.383
How many times
do you want me to say it?


852
01:07:48.976 --> 01:07:51.015
Tell me, Charlie,

853
01:07:52.313 --> 01:07:53.937
when did your wife leave you?

854
01:07:54.064 --> 01:07:58.358
I can't imagine where you heard that, Ray.
That's absolutely ridiculous.


855
01:07:58.485 --> 01:08:00.774
- Tell me, Charlie.
- It's not true.


856
01:08:02.281 --> 01:08:04.653
I have a wife. 
I have a family. I have...

857
01:08:05.075 --> 01:08:06.984
Forget it.

858
01:08:07.119 --> 01:08:09.361
- Charlie...
- Ow! Last September.


859
01:08:11.540 --> 01:08:13.579
Last September?

860
01:08:17.045 --> 01:08:19.334
You're a really good liar, Charlie.

861
01:08:21.091 --> 01:08:23.131
Oooo-eee!

862
01:08:25.554 --> 01:08:29.386
Charlie, this is Audrey.
Audrey, this is Charlie.


863
01:08:31.810 --> 01:08:33.849
Who's shittin' who here?

864
01:08:34.479 --> 01:08:36.519
Unbelievable!

865
01:08:42.946 --> 01:08:45.354
Let me ask you a question.

866
01:08:45.490 --> 01:08:48.776
- Did you ever box?
- No.


867
01:08:52.372 --> 01:08:54.578
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.


868
01:08:54.708 --> 01:08:56.747
- You sure?
- Yeah.


869
01:08:57.919 --> 01:09:01.039
- Here. Have a shot.
- No. Thank you.


870
01:09:01.464 --> 01:09:03.504
Audrey?

871
01:09:09.597 --> 01:09:12.053
I used to spar around
a lot in the joint.

872
01:09:13.226 --> 01:09:16.926
It was just me
and a bunch of the brothers.


873
01:09:17.063 --> 01:09:19.898
They all thought I was crazy.

874
01:09:20.024 --> 01:09:24.733
By the time I got out of there though,
they all had respect for me, Charlie.


875
01:09:26.531 --> 01:09:31.323
Got my nose broke three times
in three years, but... what the hell?


876
01:09:32.036 --> 01:09:34.243
A broken nose ain't gonna kill ya.

877
01:09:34.622 --> 01:09:38.667
No, it won't kill you, Ray,
but violence never solved anything.


878
01:09:38.793 --> 01:09:42.873
What goes around, comes around.
You're gonna learn that some day.


879
01:09:43.005 --> 01:09:45.543
Ray, would you just get him outta here?

880
01:09:45.675 --> 01:09:49.672
Shit, baby, he's gonna have the cops here
before we get around the block.


881
01:09:49.804 --> 01:09:54.300
Why? What is he gonna say?
Nobody forced him to come along.


882
01:09:54.433 --> 01:09:57.434
If he opens his mouth,
he can take his house in the suburbs,


883
01:09:57.561 --> 01:10:00.479
and his lawn and his station wagon,

884
01:10:00.606 --> 01:10:03.856
and his normal life,
and flush it right down the toilet.


885
01:10:03.984 --> 01:10:08.445
Unless, of course,
you were lying about that too, Charlie?


886
01:10:08.572 --> 01:10:10.861
No, I'm not lying about that.

887
01:10:16.121 --> 01:10:19.075
Do you understand the situation?

888
01:10:20.543 --> 01:10:22.250
Yeah.

889
01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:35.255
I'm sure you two
will be very happy together.


890
01:10:35.391 --> 01:10:37.430
Get the fuck out.

891
01:12:00.099 --> 01:12:02.851
Old habits die hard, huh, baby?

892
01:12:04.479 --> 01:12:06.518
<i>Charlie!</i>

893
01:12:24.457 --> 01:12:27.030
- Fill her up?
- Yeah, fill her up.


894
01:12:43.893 --> 01:12:45.221
Fill her up?

895
01:12:45.352 --> 01:12:47.926
Uh, yeah. You take credit cards... Nelson?

896
01:12:48.397 --> 01:12:52.311
- Yeah, Charlie. All major brands.
- How'd you know my name?


897
01:12:52.735 --> 01:12:54.609
- Your tag.
- Oh!


898
01:12:54.737 --> 01:12:56.776
Yeah, yeah.

899
01:12:57.823 --> 01:12:59.863
Thank you.

900
01:13:14.882 --> 01:13:18.547
- All right, Charlie, that's $13.50.
- Thanks, Nelson. Put it on there.


901
01:13:18.677 --> 01:13:21.880
And put a soda on there too.
And a road map.


902
01:13:22.014 --> 01:13:24.339
Hey, anything you want, Charlie.

903
01:13:24.475 --> 01:13:26.716
Excuse me, Joy.

904
01:13:29.146 --> 01:13:31.388
- Hey, that shirt. What happened?
- What?


905
01:13:31.523 --> 01:13:36.185
- Your shirt?
- Oh. I'm, uh... prone to nosebleeds, so...


906
01:13:36.945 --> 01:13:41.025
- Yeah, let's put a shirt on.
- Put a shirt on.


907
01:13:41.158 --> 01:13:44.408
OK? And how about a hat?

908
01:13:44.536 --> 01:13:46.694
You got it. Right here for you.

909
01:13:46.830 --> 01:13:51.291
- And, uh... do you have any trousers?
- No trousers. How about some shorts?


910
01:13:51.418 --> 01:13:55.498
- Shorts? Yeah! Let's go with some shorts.
- You're about a large, right?


911
01:13:55.630 --> 01:13:58.715
Large. Yeah. Yeah. Sounds good.

912
01:13:59.885 --> 01:14:02.007
OK. How about some socks?

913
01:14:02.137 --> 01:14:04.509
Socks? Yeah, put some socks on the...

914
01:14:04.639 --> 01:14:07.557
- There you go.
- Sounds good.


915
01:14:11.146 --> 01:14:15.095
- Fix me up, Nelson.
- Hey, Charlie? Attempt to be cool.


916
01:14:26.411 --> 01:14:29.614
- Hey, you some kind of spy, Charlie?
- Shh, Nelson!


917
01:14:32.959 --> 01:14:34.998
OK...

918
01:14:39.591 --> 01:14:43.802
- Sunglasses. I need sunglasses.
- Nah, keep 'em. You're beautiful.


919
01:14:44.053 --> 01:14:46.093
OK, all right.

920
01:14:48.433 --> 01:14:51.469
- There you are.
- OK.


921
01:14:52.812 --> 01:14:56.477
You oughta really see somebody
about that nose.


922
01:14:56.607 --> 01:14:59.359
A broken nose ain't gonna kill ya, Nelson.

923
01:14:59.485 --> 01:15:02.059
OK, there's that, there's this...
OK, thank you.


924
01:15:02.196 --> 01:15:04.153
- Hey.
- All right, Nelson.


925
01:17:11.199 --> 01:17:13.238
Hello. How are you?

926
01:17:16.788 --> 01:17:18.827
Hi.

927
01:17:32.303 --> 01:17:35.339
- Can I help you?
- How much are these babies?


928
01:17:35.473 --> 01:17:37.300
$49.95.

929
01:17:37.433 --> 01:17:39.473
- Credit cards OK?
- Sure.


930
01:17:41.270 --> 01:17:43.144
Ring 'em up.

931
01:17:43.272 --> 01:17:45.514
Will there be anything else?

932
01:17:48.361 --> 01:17:50.400
Yeah.

933
01:17:54.200 --> 01:17:55.694
Yeah. One of these shirts.

934
01:18:09.632 --> 01:18:15.385
"I have recently completed managerial
training for the LB Discount Shoe stores."


935
01:18:15.513 --> 01:18:18.846
"It looks like I'll soon
be living in Fairfield, Iowa,


936
01:18:18.974 --> 01:18:21.726
where a new franchise has just opened."
Oh, boy!


937
01:18:21.852 --> 01:18:25.684
"Accompanying me will be my wife Joyce
and three small fries,


938
01:18:25.814 --> 01:18:30.725
Billy, 5, Tina, 3, and the newest addition,
little Eric Junior, 11 months."


939
01:18:30.861 --> 01:18:32.901
What a dumb shit!

940
01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:35.320
- What?
- I'm gonna change.


941
01:18:35.491 --> 01:18:38.491
Yeah, I wanna see
how that new suit looks on you.


942
01:19:01.892 --> 01:19:03.386
- Hey, Audrey!
- Yeah?


943
01:19:03.518 --> 01:19:06.436
- I wanna see how that suit looks on you.
- Wait!


944
01:19:07.189 --> 01:19:10.143
- We going swimming or aren't we?
- Just wait a minute.


945
01:19:10.275 --> 01:19:12.268
Hey, Audrey, what's goin' on?

946
01:19:12.402 --> 01:19:14.442
- Don't come in.
- You all right?


947
01:19:18.450 --> 01:19:19.730
Hey!

948
01:19:20.785 --> 01:19:23.490
<i>
- Audrey!-</i>

949
01:19:23.622 --> 01:19:25.365
Come here!

950
01:19:25.498 --> 01:19:27.538
What are you doing?

951
01:19:30.045 --> 01:19:32.452
- It's over this way.
- Stop it! Stop it, Ray!


952
01:19:32.589 --> 01:19:35.127
Come on, I'll show you. Come on!

953
01:19:37.260 --> 01:19:38.588
No, no...

954
01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:41.840
You wanted to swim?
You wanna swim, swim!


955
01:19:46.978 --> 01:19:49.018
Asshole!

956
01:20:00.450 --> 01:20:02.988
They look like a terrible couple.

957
01:20:06.456 --> 01:20:09.540
- We're closed.
- All I need is two minutes.


958
01:20:09.667 --> 01:20:11.327
We're open tomorrow at seven.

959
01:20:11.461 --> 01:20:14.497
I already know what I want.
Come on. Please?


960
01:20:17.467 --> 01:20:20.467
Mister? Do you need any help?

961
01:20:21.012 --> 01:20:23.337
- No, I'm fine, thanks.
- OK.


962
01:20:32.606 --> 01:20:34.646
You like it around here?

963
01:20:34.900 --> 01:20:36.276
It's OK.

964
01:20:36.402 --> 01:20:38.608
Don't you get kinda bored?

965
01:20:39.989 --> 01:20:42.028
Yeah, sometimes.

966
01:20:42.616 --> 01:20:44.656
Sometimes?

967
01:20:45.786 --> 01:20:47.578
Sometimes what?

968
01:20:47.705 --> 01:20:51.074
Sometimes it's boring,
or sometimes there's something to do?


969
01:20:51.208 --> 01:20:53.165
Sometimes it's boring.

970
01:20:54.837 --> 01:20:57.292
- What's your name?
- Tracy.


971
01:20:57.882 --> 01:20:59.921
Tracy, I'm Ray.

972
01:21:00.884 --> 01:21:02.924
- Hi.
- Hi.


973
01:21:41.174 --> 01:21:43.214
OK. Fine. Here we go.

974
01:21:57.524 --> 01:22:03.858
I'll have a JD burger and some fries.
And some extra pickles.


975
01:22:05.115 --> 01:22:07.357
And a beer and a coke.

976
01:22:07.909 --> 01:22:09.487
- You got it.
- Thanks.


977
01:22:29.222 --> 01:22:31.428
Hey, fella, you using the telephone?

978
01:22:31.558 --> 01:22:33.597
No, go ahead.

979
01:23:12.890 --> 01:23:15.511
Sit down and relax
and we'll get you some coffee.


980
01:23:15.643 --> 01:23:18.312
Darlene? Coffee, please, for George.

981
01:23:20.981 --> 01:23:24.564
- How about dessert?
- Let me have the Rustler's Rhapsody.


982
01:23:24.693 --> 01:23:28.276
- Rustler's Rhapsody.
- Just a coffee for me, Darlene.


983
01:23:28.405 --> 01:23:31.905
- In a flash.
- You don't mind, do you, Ray?


984
01:23:32.034 --> 01:23:35.201
You're outta your mind.
You don't know what you're doin'.


985
01:23:35.329 --> 01:23:37.203
Charlie!

986
01:23:37.539 --> 01:23:40.576
You are one dumb son of a bitch!

987
01:23:43.045 --> 01:23:45.583
I'm almost starting to like you, Charlie.

988
01:23:45.714 --> 01:23:47.754
- Here you go.
- Thanks, Darlene.


989
01:23:48.300 --> 01:23:50.340
I want Lulu.

990
01:23:51.678 --> 01:23:55.012
Is that your name this week? Lulu?

991
01:23:55.557 --> 01:23:56.672
Yes.

992
01:23:57.059 --> 01:24:00.428
You know, Charlie,
she's not gonna be too happy


993
01:24:00.562 --> 01:24:03.848
driving around in a station wagon
the rest of her life.


994
01:24:03.982 --> 01:24:06.022
You better think about that.

995
01:24:06.985 --> 01:24:10.769
You better ask yourself
if you really want her.


996
01:24:13.033 --> 01:24:14.741
I really want her.

997
01:24:15.827 --> 01:24:16.776
Awww.

998
01:24:16.912 --> 01:24:18.821
Great.

999
01:24:19.956 --> 01:24:24.085
Charlie, you gotta fight
for a woman like this.


1000
01:24:24.961 --> 01:24:29.837
I don't have to fight you. We'll waltz outta
here, and there's not a thing you can do.


1001
01:24:31.927 --> 01:24:33.635
Grrr!

1002
01:24:35.013 --> 01:24:38.299
Oh, Charlie. You are somethin'.
You are somethin'!


1003
01:24:39.309 --> 01:24:41.551
Take a look over there.

1004
01:24:41.686 --> 01:24:43.643
Go ahead.

1005
01:24:44.314 --> 01:24:46.686
- Evening, officer.
- How's it goin'?


1006
01:24:56.034 --> 01:25:00.945
Ray, you're a convicted felon
in possession of a concealed weapon.


1007
01:25:01.080 --> 01:25:05.244
You robbed a grocery store,
assaulted that poor kid with a gun.


1008
01:25:06.002 --> 01:25:10.581
You left Pennsylvania, which is gonna
come as a surprise to your parole officer.


1009
01:25:10.715 --> 01:25:15.128
And I'd be willing to wager
that Cadillac of yours is hot.


1010
01:25:15.511 --> 01:25:17.551
Charlie...

1011
01:25:26.856 --> 01:25:29.857
Now it's you with something to lose.

1012
01:25:29.984 --> 01:25:31.811
Fuck you.

1013
01:25:32.361 --> 01:25:36.027
- He's got you, Ray.
- Fuck you too, Lulu.


1014
01:25:39.410 --> 01:25:40.988
Evening, officers.

1015
01:25:41.120 --> 01:25:43.789
- How ya doin'?
- Oh, pretty good, thank you.


1016
01:25:46.083 --> 01:25:48.123
Hand over the car keys.

1017
01:25:50.463 --> 01:25:53.132
Come on, hand over the car keys.

1018
01:25:54.216 --> 01:25:56.458
At JD's - where else?

1019
01:26:06.479 --> 01:26:09.894
<i>- Let's go.
- You're gonna regret this.</i>


1020
01:26:10.024 --> 01:26:12.266
- Well, life's full of regrets.
- No.


1021
01:26:13.068 --> 01:26:15.773
<i>You are really gonna regret this.</i>

1022
01:26:16.488 --> 01:26:19.525
- Now your wallet.
- Charlie, come on!


1023
01:26:26.457 --> 01:26:29.742
You think you're pretty smart,
don't you, Charlie?


1024
01:26:30.294 --> 01:26:32.167
Pretty smart.

1025
01:26:32.421 --> 01:26:36.335
But look, Ray, just to show you
there's no hard feelings,


1026
01:26:38.051 --> 01:26:40.127
this one's on me.

1027
01:26:46.226 --> 01:26:48.848
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.


1028
01:26:58.572 --> 01:27:01.323
The gentleman said
you'd take care of this.


1029
01:27:11.376 --> 01:27:13.452
That son of a bitch.

1030
01:27:25.473 --> 01:27:26.718
Yow!

1031
01:27:26.850 --> 01:27:28.308
God, that was great!

1032
01:27:28.435 --> 01:27:32.563
Oh, man, that'll teach him
to fool with Charlie Driggs, I'll tell you.


1033
01:27:54.794 --> 01:27:56.668
<i>OK, liar. Get out!</i>

1034
01:27:57.797 --> 01:28:01.047
- What, you jokin'?
- You saved me, I saved you. Now get out!


1035
01:28:01.175 --> 01:28:04.544
- I'm not getting out of the car.
- Get out of the fucking car!


1036
01:28:04.679 --> 01:28:07.799
- I'm in the middle of Virginia!
- Charlie, go!


1037
01:28:07.932 --> 01:28:09.925
- No! I'm not...
- Goddammit! Get out!


1038
01:28:10.059 --> 01:28:14.223
- It's the middle of the night!
- Get out of the fucking car, Charlie!


1039
01:28:15.314 --> 01:28:16.477
OK...

1040
01:28:16.607 --> 01:28:18.647
What are you?

1041
01:28:18.985 --> 01:28:20.609
Aw...

1042
01:28:33.666 --> 01:28:38.043
You're... Sometimes I don't know
whether you're kiddin' around or not.


1043
01:28:39.046 --> 01:28:42.249
Goddamn you, Charlie!
I saw your wedding ring!


1044
01:28:42.383 --> 01:28:44.874
Shit, I saw the family pictures!

1045
01:28:45.010 --> 01:28:48.545
I get involved with a married man
who's not even married?!


1046
01:28:48.681 --> 01:28:51.551
I was married
when those pictures were taken.


1047
01:28:53.102 --> 01:28:54.216
Very funny.

1048
01:28:57.648 --> 01:29:01.064
I wear the ring because
I hate to admit that my family fell apart.


1049
01:29:01.193 --> 01:29:03.814
I told you I
was married to protect myself.

1050
01:29:03.946 --> 01:29:06.900
And then I was afraid that if I told you,
you'd take off.


1051
01:29:07.032 --> 01:29:09.108
You're right, asshole. I would've.

1052
01:29:09.243 --> 01:29:13.406
- You were lying a blue streak to me too.
- Exactly.


1053
01:29:36.895 --> 01:29:38.804
Oh, thank you, Lord!

1054
01:29:38.939 --> 01:29:42.806
<i>Come in, come in.
Come, come, come! Come around!</i>


1055
01:29:42.943 --> 01:29:45.481
Come in! Come in! Come in! Come in!

1056
01:29:53.954 --> 01:29:55.662
OK...

1057
01:29:55.789 --> 01:29:59.122
I'll be back in a couple of days, OK?
You gonna be here?


1058
01:29:59.251 --> 01:30:01.788
Did your sister really run off
with a Bible salesman?


1059
01:30:01.920 --> 01:30:05.205
I swear to God. The religious types
are the worst kind.


1060
01:30:05.340 --> 01:30:08.127
- I'll be back, OK? You'll be here?
- Mm-hm.


1061
01:30:10.929 --> 01:30:13.467
OK, I better get going, all right?

1062
01:30:19.062 --> 01:30:21.220
- Go on, go on. Go home!
- See ya.


1063
01:30:21.356 --> 01:30:23.395
Hurry up. Go on.

1064
01:31:14.825 --> 01:31:17.233
<i>.. can't do anything but fail.</i>

1065
01:31:17.369 --> 01:31:21.866
<i>Did you see the SOS
Jesus COD'd to you?</i>


1066
01:31:24.960 --> 01:31:26.585
<i>Are you saved?</i>

1067
01:31:26.712 --> 01:31:28.752
<i>Are you good?</i>

1068
01:31:29.048 --> 01:31:31.087
<i>Are you OK?</i>

1069
01:31:31.717 --> 01:31:33.757
<i>It's late.</i>

1070
01:31:34.220 --> 01:31:36.259
<i>Time to go.</i>

1071
01:31:36.388 --> 01:31:41.264
<i>Thanks, Reverend Jim. It's 5 o'clock
right now, a.m., Baltimore time.</i>


1072
01:31:41.393 --> 01:31:43.433
<i>We're comin' at you live.</i>

1073
01:31:58.994 --> 01:32:01.485
<i>It's so strange.</i>

1074
01:32:02.206 --> 01:32:06.203
- Did you say something?
- I just don't wanna go to my apartment.


1075
01:32:08.503 --> 01:32:10.543
Shit...

1076
01:32:11.465 --> 01:32:13.338
Well...

1077
01:32:13.467 --> 01:32:15.708
you can stay at my place.

1078
01:32:15.844 --> 01:32:17.635
For tonight.

1079
01:32:18.263 --> 01:32:22.592
There's not much in the way of furniture,
but there's plenty of room.


1080
01:32:23.310 --> 01:32:25.349
OK, thanks.

1081
01:32:39.242 --> 01:32:41.282
Audrey Hankel.

1082
01:32:56.968 --> 01:33:00.052
Yeah, uh... Stony Brook.

1083
01:33:01.264 --> 01:33:03.422
Charles Driggs.

1084
01:33:03.558 --> 01:33:06.227
Yeah, with a D. D
-R, yeah.

1085
01:33:06.352 --> 01:33:08.724
Lemme have the address on that.

1086
01:33:08.855 --> 01:33:12.520
1427 Maple. 1427 Maple. Thanks.

1087
01:34:03.701 --> 01:34:07.200
- Where's the bathroom?
- Down the hall, to the left.


1088
01:34:51.123 --> 01:34:53.162
Charlie...

1089
01:34:59.131 --> 01:35:00.459
Yeah?

1090
01:35:00.590 --> 01:35:05.632
What are you gonna do now you've seen
how the other half lives?


1091
01:35:05.762 --> 01:35:07.802
The other half?

1092
01:35:07.931 --> 01:35:09.970
The other half of you.

1093
01:35:46.052 --> 01:35:47.879
Hiya, Charlie.

1094
01:35:48.137 --> 01:35:49.133
Ray!

1095
01:35:57.480 --> 01:35:59.520
Get up!

1096
01:36:03.361 --> 01:36:06.113
Let's see what you're made of now,
Charlie!


1097
01:36:06.948 --> 01:36:08.987
<i>Charlie?</i>

1098
01:36:10.576 --> 01:36:12.616
Charlie?

1099
01:36:13.079 --> 01:36:14.822
Ray, stop it! You'll kill him!

1100
01:36:14.956 --> 01:36:16.995
I'm just warming up!

1101
01:36:17.959 --> 01:36:19.998
Get out of the way!

1102
01:36:20.753 --> 01:36:22.378
Ow!

1103
01:36:23.547 --> 01:36:27.166
I'm glad to see you finally
made it to the suburbs, bitch!


1104
01:36:29.970 --> 01:36:31.630
Come here!

1105
01:36:35.726 --> 01:36:37.766
I don't care...

1106
01:36:39.063 --> 01:36:42.847
what she tells you, 
I know my wife.

1107
01:36:43.484 --> 01:36:47.268
And you white-bread VIP types
just don't do it for her.


1108
01:36:47.863 --> 01:36:51.731
- You all right there, Charlie?
- Charlie, I'm gonna get help!


1109
01:36:56.080 --> 01:36:57.823
Charlie!

1110
01:36:58.374 --> 01:37:01.328
Didn't I tell you to stay?
Haven't you hurt me enough?


1111
01:37:01.460 --> 01:37:04.247
Look what you're doing to me!
Get in here!


1112
01:37:05.339 --> 01:37:07.581
Why are you doing
this to me? Shut up!

1113
01:37:10.761 --> 01:37:14.972
<i>Come on in here, Charlie!
Come on into your bedroom, Charlie!</i>


1114
01:37:17.768 --> 01:37:19.677
Lulu!

1115
01:37:21.021 --> 01:37:23.310
Stop it, Ray! Stop it!

1116
01:37:23.482 --> 01:37:25.190
Charlie, are you OK?

1117
01:37:25.442 --> 01:37:27.233
Charlie!

1118
01:37:33.617 --> 01:37:35.942
- I hate you!
- I hate you too!


1119
01:37:36.119 --> 01:37:38.159
- Lulu!
- Charlie!


1120
01:37:41.750 --> 01:37:44.288
Charlie, come here! 
I got somethin' for ya!

1121
01:37:44.419 --> 01:37:47.954
Why can't you just give me a chance?
Why?! Why?!


1122
01:37:52.135 --> 01:37:54.591
Stop it! Stop it!

1123
01:37:56.181 --> 01:37:58.339
No, no...

1124
01:38:39.557 --> 01:38:42.511
Oh... Oh, God!

1125
01:38:51.903 --> 01:38:53.017
Ray!

1126
01:38:53.154 --> 01:38:55.193
No! No!

1127
01:38:56.532 --> 01:38:58.572
No!

1128
01:39:02.705 --> 01:39:05.990
I hate you so much! Stop it!

1129
01:39:06.959 --> 01:39:07.990
Charlie!

1130
01:39:08.127 --> 01:39:09.290
No, Ray!

1131
01:39:31.233 --> 01:39:33.605
Shit, Charlie.

1132
01:40:47.058 --> 01:40:50.641
I understand that the break-in
occurred an hour ago.


1133
01:40:50.770 --> 01:40:52.810
- Yeah.
- Keys.


1134
01:40:53.773 --> 01:40:55.813
He smashed a window to gain entrance

1135
01:40:55.942 --> 01:41:00.520
and you were forcibly led into the house,
Mr Driggs, through the back.


1136
01:41:00.655 --> 01:41:04.190
I understand that he manacled you
at that time.


1137
01:41:04.409 --> 01:41:06.567
Mr Driggs, did you know him?

1138
01:41:07.161 --> 01:41:09.201
Did you know the guy?

1139
01:41:13.001 --> 01:41:15.289
He was my husband.

1140
01:41:15.420 --> 01:41:17.377
Your husband?

1141
01:41:17.505 --> 01:41:19.414
Ray Sinclair.

1142
01:41:19.549 --> 01:41:21.790
<i>And what is your name?</i>

1143
01:41:21.926 --> 01:41:23.551
Audrey.

1144
01:41:23.886 --> 01:41:26.508
Audrey, you wanna
come with me, please?


1145
01:41:31.435 --> 01:41:33.227
Wait.

1146
01:41:33.688 --> 01:41:36.523
You're not...
You're not taking her away because...


1147
01:41:36.649 --> 01:41:41.110
It's all right. It's OK, Mr Driggs.
We just need to get more information.


1148
01:42:35.749 --> 01:42:37.789
Charles?

1149
01:42:38.126 --> 01:42:39.918
Larry!

1150
01:42:40.045 --> 01:42:41.954
Hi.

1151
01:42:45.384 --> 01:42:47.423
Listen, uh...

1152
01:42:48.595 --> 01:42:50.920
We're all real sorry about your leaving.

1153
01:42:51.056 --> 01:42:52.634
Oh, that's nice.

1154
01:42:52.766 --> 01:42:55.055
There's no way to get you
to change your mind?


1155
01:42:55.185 --> 01:42:57.972
No. Nope, I don't think so, no.

1156
01:42:58.730 --> 01:43:02.514
- Is there anything I can do?
- No. Everything's been taken care of.


1157
01:43:02.651 --> 01:43:04.690
Everything's fine.

1158
01:43:05.278 --> 01:43:07.105
Well...

1159
01:43:08.573 --> 01:43:09.949
Hey!

1160
01:43:16.957 --> 01:43:19.530
How do you figure
a guy like Ray Sinclair?


1161
01:43:32.430 --> 01:43:34.304
Well...

1162
01:43:34.516 --> 01:43:36.639
Stay in touch. Promise?

1163
01:43:36.935 --> 01:43:38.477
Promise.

1164
01:43:42.190 --> 01:43:43.814
Hey, Larry.

1165
01:43:43.942 --> 01:43:46.729
It's better to be a live dog
than a dead lion.


1166
01:43:47.987 --> 01:43:50.657
It's been good working with you, Charlie.

1167
01:43:53.660 --> 01:43:55.699
<i># Ooh, yeah</i>

Who is it?

1179
01:44:35.826 --> 01:44:40.203
I'm looking for the woman in 3F.
Lulu is her name, or Audrey.


1180
01:44:40.873 --> 01:44:44.076
I'm in 3F. You must want
the girl that moved out.


1181
01:44:44.210 --> 01:44:46.961
Uh... did you talk to her?
I mean, did she say...


1182
01:44:47.087 --> 01:44:50.836
Did she say where she was goin',
or a forwarding address or anything?


1183
01:44:50.966 --> 01:44:53.374
No. I moved in, it was empty.

1184

OK, thanks.

1185

- Hey!
- Yeah?


1186
01:44:59.266 --> 01:45:03.346
- Do you know what her rent was?
- Her rent?


1187
01:45:03.479 --> 01:45:08.306
Yeah. This building is rent-stabilised,
but I think the landlord is screwing me.


1188
01:45:10.068 --> 01:45:12.441
Yeah, well, it wouldn't surprise me.

<i># Ooh, yeah</i>

1197
01:45:51.610 --> 01:45:54.480
The MP would grab 'em
and confiscate 'em,


1198
01:45:54.613 --> 01:45:57.530
and I'd take 'em back
and I'd sell 'em again.


1199
01:46:04.581 --> 01:46:07.285
- Here's your check, sir.
- Oh, thank you.


1200
01:46:36.237 --> 01:46:40.021
Hey! You didn't pay for your food.
Where you think you're goin'?


1201
01:46:41.325 --> 01:46:43.781
- Come on, mister. I haven't got all day.
- What?


1202
01:46:43.911 --> 01:46:48.407
- You didn't pay for your food.
- Sure I paid, Dottie. I put $5 on the table.


1203
01:46:48.541 --> 01:46:50.165
Do you think I'm stupid?

1204
01:46:50.293 --> 01:46:54.871
Look, it's a mistake. It was a $3.15 bill,
I left $5 on the table. That's a healthy tip.


1205
01:46:55.006 --> 01:46:59.917
- Do you expect to eat and not pay?
- All right. It's not that big a deal to me.


1206
01:47:16.235 --> 01:47:19.936
- Keep the, uh... keep the change.
- Sure.


1207
01:47:34.003 --> 01:47:36.291
You never said goodbye.

1208
01:47:37.965 --> 01:47:40.337
I never wanted to say goodbye.

1209
01:47:45.514 --> 01:47:47.637
Want a ride?

1210
01:47:57.568 --> 01:47:59.644
Sure, Audrey.

1211
