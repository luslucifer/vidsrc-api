00:00:27.831 --> 00:00:29.367
Hi, leave a detailed message

2
00:00:29.433 --> 00:00:32.135
and I'll get back to you
as soon as I possibly can.


3
00:00:32.202 --> 00:00:34.104
Have a great day.

4
00:00:34.171 --> 00:00:36.006
James, this is Steven.

5
00:00:36.073 --> 00:00:38.876
Could you please call
me as soon as possible?


6
00:00:38.942 --> 00:00:39.942
Thanks.

7
00:01:06.103 --> 00:01:07.805
She's asking for you.

8
00:01:10.641 --> 00:01:12.710
She's asking for you.

9
00:01:50.147 --> 00:01:55.486
That's alright, we're
home and we're together.


10
00:01:55.553 --> 00:01:56.587
I'm happy.

11
00:02:00.658 --> 00:02:05.362
I left her a message,
maybe she'll call.


12
00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:07.531
She never has before.

13
00:02:12.402 --> 00:02:14.738
Her Bible, I need her Bible.

14
00:02:32.122 --> 00:02:34.124
Open it to the bookmark.

15
00:02:40.798 --> 00:02:42.966
Take her Bible, Steven.

16
00:02:44.334 --> 00:02:47.571
Forgive her, and ask
her to forgive us.


17
00:02:51.775 --> 00:02:55.579
We loved her, Steven,
but we failed her.


18
00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.051
Promise me you will
give her the Bible.


19
00:03:01.118 --> 00:03:02.219
Forgive her.

20
00:03:03.787 --> 00:03:05.656
Ask her forgiveness.

21
00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:13.130
I promise.

22
00:03:14.498 --> 00:03:16.634
Thank you, Steven.

23
00:03:17.501 --> 00:03:20.571
Please remember that I love you.

24
00:03:22.172 --> 00:03:25.208
I'll be waiting
for you in heaven.


25
00:03:51.401 --> 00:03:53.136
She's with God now.

26
00:03:58.542 --> 00:04:00.944
You did the right thing,

27
00:04:02.512 --> 00:04:04.214
bringing her home.

28
00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:24.260
It's James.

29
00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:27.731
You've called at
a bad time, James.


30
00:05:27.798 --> 00:05:29.933
I'm sorry I
didn't call sooner.


31
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.702
Miranda and I have
been very, very busy.


32
00:05:31.769 --> 00:05:33.336
Abigail is gone.

33
00:05:34.672 --> 00:05:36.239
I was hoping Miranda
would come back


34
00:05:36.306 --> 00:05:40.410
to see her before
it was too late.


35
00:05:40.477 --> 00:05:41.979
Now it's too late.

36
00:05:43.847 --> 00:05:45.783
The funeral was this morning.

37
00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:48.451
I'm so sorry, is
there anything I can do?


38
00:05:48.518 --> 00:05:49.753
Nothing.

39
00:05:51.421 --> 00:05:52.956
I'll tell Miranda,

40
00:05:53.023 --> 00:05:54.692
I think it's something
she ought to know.


41
00:05:54.758 --> 00:05:57.294
Don't you tell her a thing.

42
00:05:58.662 --> 00:06:01.398
Abigail had me promise
to do one thing,


43
00:06:01.464 --> 00:06:03.366
and I'm going to do it.

44
00:06:06.536 --> 00:06:09.506
That's my business, James.

45
00:06:09.572 --> 00:06:11.308
Look, I wanted you to know

46
00:06:11.374 --> 00:06:13.944
because you were a
comfort to Abigail,


47
00:06:14.011 --> 00:06:17.447
letting us know how
Miranda was doing.


48
00:06:17.514 --> 00:06:21.885
But Abigail is gone now and I
have her wishes to consider.


49
00:06:23.954 --> 00:06:27.590
I will tell Miranda
that Abigail is gone,


50
00:06:27.657 --> 00:06:28.926
to her face.

51
00:06:28.992 --> 00:06:30.352
I don't think
that's a good idea.


52
00:06:30.393 --> 00:06:35.198
It's a terrible
idea, but I promised.


53
00:06:35.265 --> 00:06:36.934
I need your address.

54
00:06:37.868 --> 00:06:39.436
I don't know, Steven.

55
00:06:39.502 --> 00:06:41.538
Listen, I've got to go.

56
00:08:05.823 --> 00:08:07.958
Forgiveness.

57
00:08:41.491 --> 00:08:44.828
It's just not the
same without her.


58
00:11:09.339 --> 00:11:12.775
I will tell Miranda
that Abigail is gone,


59
00:11:12.842 --> 00:11:14.044
to her face.

60
00:11:16.446 --> 00:11:20.450
Lord, am I doing
the right thing?


61
00:11:20.517 --> 00:11:24.054
I don't know if I can
keep this to myself.


62
00:13:16.233 --> 00:13:18.067
I'm headed to the office.

63
00:13:18.135 --> 00:13:19.169
Okay.

64
00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:23.240
You look good.
Thank you.


65
00:13:26.709 --> 00:13:29.179
Let's not talk about
dinner right now, okay?


66
00:13:29.246 --> 00:13:32.915
There's something I really
need to talk to you about.


67
00:13:36.186 --> 00:13:38.655
Sit down, please.

68
00:13:43.193 --> 00:13:45.061
You're starting to worry me.

69
00:13:45.128 --> 00:13:47.664
Please don't be mad at me.

70
00:13:49.332 --> 00:13:52.602
I've been speaking with
Steven for a few months now.


71
00:13:55.172 --> 00:13:56.715
You know I want nothing
to do with them,


72
00:13:56.739 --> 00:13:59.776
and you've been talking to
him for months behind my back?


73
00:13:59.842 --> 00:14:02.011
I wanted to let them
know that you were alright,


74
00:14:02.078 --> 00:14:05.348
but that's not the
issue right now.


75
00:14:09.051 --> 00:14:11.087
He called me a few months ago.

76
00:14:11.154 --> 00:14:13.122
Abigail was sick.

77
00:14:13.190 --> 00:14:14.891
Cancer, I'm sorry.

78
00:14:21.731 --> 00:14:24.701
She passed away
a few days ago.


79
00:14:32.442 --> 00:14:37.079
Well there's nothing
I can do about that now.


80
00:14:37.146 --> 00:14:38.915
When's the funeral?

81
00:14:40.217 --> 00:14:42.652
It was earlier this week.

82
00:14:46.289 --> 00:14:49.125
Well I wouldn't
have gone anyway.


83
00:14:49.192 --> 00:14:50.192
Wait.

84
00:14:52.495 --> 00:14:54.664
You talk to them for
months behind my back,


85
00:14:54.731 --> 00:14:58.134
and you pick now, after
Abigail's gone, to tell me that?


86
00:14:58.201 --> 00:14:59.445
I didn't know what else to do.

87
00:14:59.469 --> 00:15:02.572
James, they lied
to me for years.


88
00:15:02.639 --> 00:15:04.207
I was going to
church every Sunday,


89
00:15:04.274 --> 00:15:05.584
and everybody else knew
they were lying to me.


90
00:15:05.608 --> 00:15:08.245
And now you're lying to me?

91
00:15:11.147 --> 00:15:12.782
That went well.

92
00:15:42.078 --> 00:15:43.078
Liars.

93
00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:49.786
And now he's a liar.

94
00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:55.057
Knock knock,
Miranda, are you back there?


95
00:15:55.124 --> 00:15:56.693
Yeah, come on in.

96
00:16:04.967 --> 00:16:06.269
Thank you.

97
00:16:06.336 --> 00:16:10.407
I just had to get out of
that house for a minute.


98
00:16:12.575 --> 00:16:14.076
Oh, I'm interrupting you.

99
00:16:14.143 --> 00:16:16.913
No, no, no, it's fine.

100
00:16:16.979 --> 00:16:19.849
Turns out I needed some company.

101
00:16:19.916 --> 00:16:21.183
Me too.

102
00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:22.761
Who would think with
doctors and nurses


103
00:16:22.785 --> 00:16:24.597
and therapists barging
around the house all day


104
00:16:24.621 --> 00:16:26.823
I'd need company, but...

105
00:16:28.057 --> 00:16:31.193
I could use a moment of
quiet time with a friend.


106
00:16:33.463 --> 00:16:36.299
He's getting better every day.

107
00:16:36.366 --> 00:16:39.836
He recognizes me now and
the therapist said that


108
00:16:39.902 --> 00:16:42.872
he should be out of the
wheelchair in a couple of months.


109
00:16:42.939 --> 00:16:47.109
And the nurses are optimistic
too, but the doctors...


110
00:16:47.176 --> 00:16:49.145
Don't listen to the doctors.

111
00:16:49.211 --> 00:16:50.411
Doctors are always pessimists,

112
00:16:50.447 --> 00:16:52.649
listen to the therapists
and the nurses.


113
00:16:52.715 --> 00:16:55.284
They're the ones spending
all this time with Michael.


114
00:16:55.352 --> 00:16:59.255
Yeah, they spend more
time with him than I do.


115
00:16:59.322 --> 00:17:02.559
And with that realization,
I need to get home.


116
00:17:02.625 --> 00:17:05.027
Mike will be
wondering where I am.


117
00:17:05.094 --> 00:17:07.964
Well, come back any
time, I'll make some tea.


118
00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:11.167
I took our health and the
lives we had for granted.


119
00:17:11.233 --> 00:17:12.435
Never again.

120
00:18:22.104 --> 00:18:26.676
Why am I doing this to myself?

121
00:18:28.411 --> 00:18:31.548
Hmm, car's running
a little rough.


122
00:18:31.614 --> 00:18:35.685
I think I'll get off
the interstate for now.


123
00:19:01.778 --> 00:19:03.446
You were working
late last night.


124
00:19:03.513 --> 00:19:05.448
I tried not to wake you.

125
00:19:05.515 --> 00:19:07.784
Yeah, I didn't sleep well.

126
00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:10.953
Listen, I'm sorry I went
against your wishes.


127
00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:13.956
I haven't spoken to
them for years, by choice.


128
00:19:14.023 --> 00:19:16.092
You had no right
to just call them.


129
00:19:16.158 --> 00:19:17.158
I know.

130
00:19:18.127 --> 00:19:19.638
And Abigail dying
doesn't change that.


131
00:19:19.662 --> 00:19:22.632
I'm not going back there, ever.

132
00:19:24.033 --> 00:19:27.069
I have a birth mother,
we have a relationship.


133
00:19:27.136 --> 00:19:28.136
That's it.

134
00:19:31.541 --> 00:19:35.678
I better do something
before he gets here.


135
00:20:37.339 --> 00:20:39.141
I'm pretty good with cars.

136
00:20:39.208 --> 00:20:41.143
That makes one of us.

137
00:20:43.479 --> 00:20:44.180
Steven.

138
00:20:44.246 --> 00:20:45.081
Joseph.

139
00:20:45.147 --> 00:20:46.749
Nice to meet you.

140
00:20:48.217 --> 00:20:51.053
Guess I'll have to
walk back into town.


141
00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:53.590
Gotta be a couple miles.

142
00:20:53.656 --> 00:20:56.392
I just walked
through that town.


143
00:20:56.458 --> 00:20:58.460
It's nice, but I'm don't think

144
00:20:58.527 --> 00:21:01.097
there's a mechanic
there that can help you.


145
00:21:01.163 --> 00:21:03.299
Not on a Saturday, anyway.

146
00:21:04.567 --> 00:21:06.869
Is it Saturday already?

147
00:21:06.936 --> 00:21:12.208
When you're retired the days
just sorta run together.


148
00:21:12.274 --> 00:21:15.377
Every day is a gift
from the Lord, Steven.


149
00:21:15.444 --> 00:21:19.816
Trouble is, some people think
he gave us an endless supply.


150
00:21:22.518 --> 00:21:25.788
I think I feel a
loose wire here.


151
00:21:25.855 --> 00:21:27.924
That might've gotten it.

152
00:21:29.025 --> 00:21:31.961
Alright, hop in
and start 'er up.


153
00:21:53.282 --> 00:21:54.350
You're all set to go.

154
00:21:56.485 --> 00:21:58.287
Los Angeles.

155
00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:01.891
That'd be great.

156
00:22:01.958 --> 00:22:03.826
Wonderful, hop in.

157
00:22:05.662 --> 00:22:07.797
You've reached my
cell phone voicemail,


158
00:22:07.864 --> 00:22:10.566
please leave a message.

159
00:22:10.633 --> 00:22:12.902
I assume you're
already headed this way.


160
00:22:12.969 --> 00:22:17.306
Our address is 407 Valley
View Drive, Sherman Oaks.


161
00:22:22.111 --> 00:22:24.981
In for a penny, in for a pound.

162
00:22:25.047 --> 00:22:27.249
I hope Miranda can
forgive me for this,


163
00:22:27.316 --> 00:22:29.752
I'm keeping this from her too.

164
00:22:35.191 --> 00:22:38.160
Sure is nice to finally get
away from all that grey sky,


165
00:22:38.227 --> 00:22:40.229
but it's getting colder.

166
00:22:42.665 --> 00:22:44.734
By the way, I have
an extra jacket.


167
00:22:44.801 --> 00:22:47.704
You can borrow it if you want.

168
00:22:51.573 --> 00:22:55.111
Not exactly the
talkative type, are you?


169
00:22:56.879 --> 00:22:59.348
I'm just enjoying the scenery.

170
00:22:59.415 --> 00:23:03.019
It's a lot to take in
traveling this fast.


171
00:23:03.085 --> 00:23:08.324
You're the first
person who's said I drive fast.


172
00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:11.293
Well, I've been walking.

173
00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:14.096
I like driving
these old highways.


174
00:23:14.163 --> 00:23:18.267
You get to see a little bit of
what America used to be like.


175
00:23:18.334 --> 00:23:20.536
You miss a lot driving
the interstates,


176
00:23:20.602 --> 00:23:22.872
and even more when you fly.

177
00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:26.843
I like this speed just fine,

178
00:23:28.945 --> 00:23:31.781
and the scenery is beautiful.

179
00:23:33.515 --> 00:23:38.020
The scenery will get
better as we go west.


180
00:23:38.087 --> 00:23:39.822
Ah, yes, the mountains.

181
00:23:39.889 --> 00:23:42.691
I am looking forward to that.

182
00:23:42.759 --> 00:23:45.527
Have you ever been
through the Rockies?


183
00:23:45.594 --> 00:23:46.963
No, not yet.

184
00:23:48.765 --> 00:23:51.500
Well, you're in
for a real treat.


185
00:23:51.567 --> 00:23:53.235
Take your time.

186
00:23:53.302 --> 00:23:58.540
I haven't had my fill of
these wide open spaces.


187
00:23:58.607 --> 00:24:02.845
Me, I get tired
of the flat after a while.


188
00:24:04.914 --> 00:24:07.750
I could never tire of this.

189
00:24:09.085 --> 00:24:10.486
Maybe you're right.

190
00:24:10.552 --> 00:24:14.423
It does have a sort of
stark beauty about it.


191
00:24:41.517 --> 00:24:43.452
What'd you get?

192
00:24:43.519 --> 00:24:45.888
Bread and peanut butter.

193
00:24:56.565 --> 00:25:00.970
Yeah, peanut butter,
the world's perfect food.


194
00:25:16.485 --> 00:25:18.020
Good sandwich.

195
00:25:47.416 --> 00:25:51.988
We've gotta stop for the
night, I'm getting too tired.


196
00:25:53.856 --> 00:25:56.192
We're in Pueblo, Colorado.

197
00:25:57.026 --> 00:25:59.228
I'm gonna get a room.

198
00:25:59.295 --> 00:26:02.731
I'm too old to
bunk with somebody.


199
00:26:02.798 --> 00:26:04.400
That's fine.

200
00:26:04.466 --> 00:26:07.870
No reason for me to
spend money on a room.


201
00:26:07.937 --> 00:26:12.774
I don't mind sleeping
outside, I like the view.


202
00:26:12.841 --> 00:26:14.376
Suit yourself.

203
00:26:37.766 --> 00:26:38.700
See you in the morning.

204
00:26:38.767 --> 00:26:39.902
Alright.

205
00:27:32.955 --> 00:27:35.057
Hey, Joseph!

206
00:27:37.026 --> 00:27:38.927
Did you decide the
room was too stuffy?


207
00:27:38.995 --> 00:27:40.372
I decided that
spending the extra money


208
00:27:40.396 --> 00:27:43.232
for another room
wasn't a bad idea.


209
00:27:43.299 --> 00:27:45.801
Besides that, it's gonna
rain, you'll get drenched.


210
00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:49.638
I guess you're right.

211
00:27:49.705 --> 00:27:54.076
You got the car running,
it's the least I can do.


212
00:27:54.143 --> 00:27:55.511
Okay, come on.

213
00:28:05.787 --> 00:28:10.226
Thank you Lord for
providing me a friend


214
00:28:10.292 --> 00:28:13.029
that cared enough
to give me shelter.


215
00:29:11.653 --> 00:29:14.022
I found some tea bags
next to the coffee maker.


216
00:29:14.090 --> 00:29:15.900
Would you care to join
me in a cup of green tea?


217
00:29:15.924 --> 00:29:17.193
Come on in.

218
00:29:18.094 --> 00:29:19.361
It'll help you sleep.

219
00:29:19.428 --> 00:29:21.073
I don't normally need
help getting to sleep,


220
00:29:21.097 --> 00:29:23.799
but a cup of tea sounds nice.

221
00:29:26.768 --> 00:29:28.337
I don't mean to bother you.

222
00:29:28.404 --> 00:29:30.139
I just enjoy sipping
a cup of green tea


223
00:29:30.206 --> 00:29:33.609
and having intelligent
conversation in the evening,


224
00:29:33.675 --> 00:29:36.044
when the opportunity
presents itself.


225
00:29:36.112 --> 00:29:38.080
It's a good idea.

226
00:29:39.615 --> 00:29:40.892
I was just going to
do a little reading


227
00:29:40.916 --> 00:29:42.851
before going to sleep.

228
00:29:42.918 --> 00:29:45.721
That's a fine choice.

229
00:29:45.787 --> 00:29:47.123
What's your favorite book?

230
00:29:47.189 --> 00:29:48.657
Acts.

231
00:29:48.724 --> 00:29:52.594
I like reading about
action, not just words.


232
00:29:54.096 --> 00:29:57.666
I remember that
printing, 1970s, I think.


233
00:30:00.136 --> 00:30:02.238
You've got a great memory.

234
00:30:02.304 --> 00:30:05.207
It was a gift to my daughter.

235
00:30:11.713 --> 00:30:15.384
That's a long story
and very private.


236
00:30:18.086 --> 00:30:20.122
I don't mean to pry.

237
00:30:23.792 --> 00:30:24.993
Nice tea by the way.

238
00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:26.428
It was a good idea,

239
00:30:26.495 --> 00:30:31.933
but we've got all day for
intelligent conversation.


240
00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:35.070
I can tell you're busy.

241
00:30:35.137 --> 00:30:37.739
I can finish this in my room.

242
00:30:41.543 --> 00:30:44.079
What time are we checking out?

243
00:30:44.146 --> 00:30:47.383
I'd like to get on the
road by eight o'clock.


244
00:30:47.449 --> 00:30:50.085
Again, thank you for the room.

245
00:30:50.152 --> 00:30:51.787
It was very nice.

246
00:30:51.853 --> 00:30:53.755
You're welcome.

247
00:30:53.822 --> 00:30:54.822
Good night.

248
00:31:08.204 --> 00:31:10.306
Good morning, sleep well?

249
00:31:11.307 --> 00:31:13.375
Sure did.

250
00:31:25.254 --> 00:31:27.356
Just so you know, I
like to stop now and then


251
00:31:27.423 --> 00:31:30.959
and stretch my legs,
and enjoy the scenery.


252
00:32:09.565 --> 00:32:13.034
Boy, I wish Abigail was
here with me to see this.


253
00:32:13.101 --> 00:32:15.471
She would really enjoy it.

254
00:32:20.442 --> 00:32:21.910
Oh, I miss her.

255
00:32:42.664 --> 00:32:46.234
Steven, I'm having
second thoughts about this.


256
00:32:46.302 --> 00:32:48.337
Please give me a call.

257
00:32:49.204 --> 00:32:50.906
I'm already in Colorado.

258
00:32:50.972 --> 00:32:54.410
I'll be there in
a couple of days.


259
00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:15.397
Come on, Joseph, time
to get back on the road.


260
00:33:54.169 --> 00:33:57.172
Hard to believe it was so
warm just two days ago.


261
00:33:57.238 --> 00:33:59.641
Now we're surrounded by snow.

262
00:34:29.771 --> 00:34:34.576
I have to make a phone call,
gimme about five minutes.


263
00:34:34.643 --> 00:34:36.945
Well, I'll just wander.

264
00:34:57.399 --> 00:35:01.002
It's Steven,
returning your call.


265
00:35:01.069 --> 00:35:02.337
Listen, I'm glad you called.

266
00:35:02.404 --> 00:35:03.715
I've really been having
some second thoughts


267
00:35:03.739 --> 00:35:05.240
about you coming out here.

268
00:35:05.306 --> 00:35:07.142
It's too late for that, James.

269
00:35:07.208 --> 00:35:08.410
I'm already in Colorado.

270
00:35:08.477 --> 00:35:09.978
I'll be there in
a couple of days.


271
00:35:10.045 --> 00:35:12.280
Well, then, listen, I'm
going to have to tell Miranda.


272
00:35:12.347 --> 00:35:15.083
I just can't have you you
show up unannounced like that.


273
00:35:15.150 --> 00:35:16.485
I understand.

274
00:35:16.552 --> 00:35:18.687
As a matter of fact,
I insist you tell her.


275
00:35:18.754 --> 00:35:21.189
If she still chooses
not to see me, so be it.


276
00:35:21.256 --> 00:35:24.793
Either way, you're really
putting me in a bad spot here.


277
00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:27.162
The middle is
always awkward, James.


278
00:35:27.228 --> 00:35:30.198
You just tell her and I'll
deal with the consequences.


279
00:35:30.265 --> 00:35:34.970
Alright, listen, see you
soon, have a safe drive.


280
00:35:35.036 --> 00:35:36.505
Alright, bye.

281
00:35:37.906 --> 00:35:42.110
Yeah, he'll deal with
the consequences, right.


282
00:35:46.515 --> 00:35:47.983
I don't know.

283
00:35:50.151 --> 00:35:52.488
Would you like
to talk about it?


284
00:35:52.554 --> 00:35:55.657
No, I need some time to think.

285
00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:22.884
- Hey.
- Hi.


286
00:36:25.521 --> 00:36:28.223
Everyone was asking about you.

287
00:36:31.459 --> 00:36:32.694
Every Sunday.

288
00:36:37.533 --> 00:36:39.000
I don't know.

289
00:36:42.403 --> 00:36:45.541
Steven's coming
to Los Angeles.


290
00:36:49.244 --> 00:36:52.881
It's a free country,
LA's a big city.


291
00:36:54.382 --> 00:36:56.752
I gave him our address.

292
00:37:00.288 --> 00:37:01.489
Strike two.

293
00:37:08.296 --> 00:37:10.899
I'm chopping vegetables, I
would stand back if I were you.


294
00:37:10.966 --> 00:37:14.536
Sweetheart, I'm sorry,
I didn't know what to do.


295
00:37:14.603 --> 00:37:16.147
I don't understand
what's going on here.


296
00:37:16.171 --> 00:37:18.540
I don't understand
what your problem is.


297
00:37:18.607 --> 00:37:21.176
This is my life,
this is my decision.


298
00:37:21.242 --> 00:37:24.145
It took everything I had to
pack my bags and leave Kentucky,


299
00:37:24.212 --> 00:37:25.581
and I'm not going back there.

300
00:37:25.647 --> 00:37:27.415
I know, but all the
blame, all the hate...


301
00:37:27.482 --> 00:37:29.217
I don't hate them.

302
00:37:29.284 --> 00:37:30.886
Then give him a chance.

303
00:37:30.952 --> 00:37:32.888
Let him see you one more
time before he dies.


304
00:37:32.954 --> 00:37:35.090
Is that really too much to ask?

305
00:37:35.156 --> 00:37:36.257
Yes, it is.

306
00:37:38.627 --> 00:37:40.829
Well, then, maybe we
should take some time off


307
00:37:40.896 --> 00:37:42.631
and just not be here
when he gets here.


308
00:37:42.698 --> 00:37:44.132
I don't know.

309
00:37:47.268 --> 00:37:49.571
You've had some time
to think about this.


310
00:37:49.638 --> 00:37:51.306
Let me think about
it for a while.


311
00:37:51.372 --> 00:37:52.372
Fine.

312
00:38:03.351 --> 00:38:06.855
Good Lord gave us this
beautiful country to live in,


313
00:38:06.922 --> 00:38:08.757
the Bible to live by,

314
00:38:08.824 --> 00:38:11.459
and delicious peanut
butter sandwiches.


315
00:38:11.526 --> 00:38:14.930
Be greedy to ask
for anything else.


316
00:38:14.996 --> 00:38:19.000
God gave me a beautiful
wife, a wonderful home,


317
00:38:19.067 --> 00:38:22.604
good health, and
now this journey.


318
00:38:22.671 --> 00:38:25.240
Traveling with your
daughter's bible.


319
00:38:25.306 --> 00:38:29.310
Sure would like to
know more about that.


320
00:38:29.377 --> 00:38:33.314
I'm not ready to
talk about that yet.


321
00:39:40.348 --> 00:39:41.917
Wonder what the first
settlers thought


322
00:39:41.983 --> 00:39:45.220
when they saw that
wall of mountains.


323
00:39:46.521 --> 00:39:51.492
I'd imagine a combination
of awe and discouragement.


324
00:39:51.559 --> 00:39:57.198
Kinda like the way most
people approach life today.


325
00:39:57.265 --> 00:40:01.102
I can't tell if that's
profound or just depressing.


326
00:40:36.304 --> 00:40:37.304
Come on.

327
00:41:26.855 --> 00:41:28.489
I don't want to
fight with you, James.


328
00:41:28.556 --> 00:41:32.293
I don't want to
fight with you either.


329
00:41:33.761 --> 00:41:36.597
How long have you
been talking to Steven?


330
00:41:36.664 --> 00:41:39.434
For about a year now.

331
00:41:40.735 --> 00:41:42.170
You started this?

332
00:41:43.071 --> 00:41:44.505
After you told me about them,

333
00:41:44.572 --> 00:41:49.044
I figured I'd call 'em so
they wouldn't worry about you.


334
00:41:49.110 --> 00:41:51.479
Let me see if I've
got this straight.


335
00:41:51.546 --> 00:41:52.756
You give them a
call after you knew


336
00:41:52.780 --> 00:41:54.415
I didn't want them in our lives,

337
00:41:54.482 --> 00:41:55.726
and then you find
out Abigail is dying,


338
00:41:55.750 --> 00:41:56.852
and you don't tell me?

339
00:41:56.918 --> 00:41:57.853
I wasn't thinking.

340
00:41:57.919 --> 00:41:59.120
I thought I'd give them a call

341
00:41:59.187 --> 00:42:00.721
just so they could
have some peace.


342
00:42:00.788 --> 00:42:04.425
And then this whole
thing with Abigail...


343
00:42:04.492 --> 00:42:08.897
I thought I would have
to admit the call then.


344
00:42:08.964 --> 00:42:12.267
And now he's coming out
here, do you know why?


345
00:42:12.333 --> 00:42:14.635
No, not really, just
to come see you I gather.


346
00:42:14.702 --> 00:42:17.705
Well tell him not to come,
tell him he's not welcome.


347
00:42:17.772 --> 00:42:19.841
I did, he's coming anyway.

348
00:42:19.908 --> 00:42:21.977
That 'cause you
gave him our address.


349
00:42:24.412 --> 00:42:28.483
I don't need people in
my life that I can't trust.


350
00:42:28.549 --> 00:42:32.387
Did you ever think
of forgiving them?


351
00:42:32.453 --> 00:42:34.255
Never crossed my mind.

352
00:42:35.390 --> 00:42:36.868
Maybe we should go
out of town for a while.


353
00:42:36.892 --> 00:42:38.393
No, we're staying.

354
00:42:38.459 --> 00:42:39.694
You wanted this,

355
00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:43.364
now you're going to see
what's gonna happen.


356
00:43:48.363 --> 00:43:51.332
There's a lot of answers
in that book, Steven,


357
00:43:51.399 --> 00:43:55.603
but perhaps not about
your particular situation.


358
00:43:55.670 --> 00:43:59.007
Would you care to
share your story?


359
00:44:05.413 --> 00:44:09.284
This is something
I've never told anyone.


360
00:44:14.555 --> 00:44:19.860
It was a secret that Abigail
and I protected for many years.


361
00:44:19.927 --> 00:44:23.231
Maybe it's time
you told someone.


362
00:44:24.699 --> 00:44:27.135
My wife Abigail
and I were married


363
00:44:27.202 --> 00:44:30.138
for 48 years, she
died last week.


364
00:44:34.942 --> 00:44:37.445
I'm very sorry to hear that.

365
00:44:41.849 --> 00:44:43.551
A few years into our marriage

366
00:44:43.618 --> 00:44:48.323
we found out we couldn't
have any children of our own.


367
00:44:48.389 --> 00:44:50.491
Abigail was devastated.

368
00:44:53.794 --> 00:44:58.166
Then after about a year,
she decided we should adopt.


369
00:45:00.168 --> 00:45:03.771
I wasn't sold on the idea,
but Abigail said that


370
00:45:03.838 --> 00:45:07.942
we had an opportunity to
make a child's life better.


371
00:45:08.009 --> 00:45:10.311
Who could argue with that?

372
00:45:10.378 --> 00:45:11.779
It's a noble
thing to wanna make


373
00:45:11.846 --> 00:45:13.614
someone else's life better.

374
00:45:13.681 --> 00:45:16.851
That's what Abigail said.

375
00:45:16.917 --> 00:45:18.919
So we went to an adoption agency

376
00:45:18.986 --> 00:45:20.688
and found a little angel.

377
00:45:22.123 --> 00:45:25.893
She was three years
old and her name was,


378
00:45:25.960 --> 00:45:27.095
is Miranda.

379
00:45:29.864 --> 00:45:34.235
This is the Bible we gave
her when she came to us.


380
00:45:37.238 --> 00:45:39.006
We wanted to raise her right,

381
00:45:39.074 --> 00:45:42.977
see to it that she went
to church every Sunday.


382
00:45:43.044 --> 00:45:45.580
She grew up loving the Lord.

383
00:45:46.881 --> 00:45:51.586
The day she was baptized is
a day I will never forget.


384
00:45:51.652 --> 00:45:53.221
Then she turned 18.

385
00:45:55.390 --> 00:45:59.060
Abigail and I had
discussed it for years,


386
00:46:00.428 --> 00:46:03.864
but we decided it was finally
time to tell her the truth,


387
00:46:03.931 --> 00:46:05.666
that she was adopted.

388
00:46:07.468 --> 00:46:10.205
And I'm assuming that
didn't go very well.


389
00:46:10.271 --> 00:46:14.175
Worse than you could
have ever imagined.


390
00:46:15.843 --> 00:46:18.179
She called us liars.

391
00:46:18.246 --> 00:46:20.348
Said that she hated us,

392
00:46:23.784 --> 00:46:26.454
that her whole life
had been a lie.


393
00:46:26.521 --> 00:46:28.189
She said she'd been the brunt

394
00:46:28.256 --> 00:46:31.459
of a 15 years practical joke,
everyone else was in on it,


395
00:46:31.526 --> 00:46:36.063
that the whole parish was
laughing at her behind her back.


396
00:46:38.266 --> 00:46:40.067
She said she hated us,

397
00:46:40.135 --> 00:46:44.239
she never wanted to see
us again, and she left.


398
00:46:46.274 --> 00:46:48.309
That was 25 years ago.

399
00:46:51.312 --> 00:46:53.814
And you haven't
seen her since?


400
00:46:53.881 --> 00:46:56.651
No calls, no letters, nothing.

401
00:47:00.087 --> 00:47:03.158
We figured the worst, of course.

402
00:47:04.859 --> 00:47:07.862
But then, about a year ago,

403
00:47:07.928 --> 00:47:12.367
we got a call from a
man in Los Angeles.


404
00:47:12.433 --> 00:47:16.737
Said he was Miranda's
husband, James.


405
00:47:16.804 --> 00:47:20.508
Said he'd looked us
up on the Internet,


406
00:47:20.575 --> 00:47:24.111
I still don't know
how that's legal.


407
00:47:24.179 --> 00:47:27.081
Anyway, he gave
us his cell phone


408
00:47:27.148 --> 00:47:30.385
and we talked to
him now and then.


409
00:47:33.421 --> 00:47:36.991
That was nice of him
to reach out to you.


410
00:47:37.057 --> 00:47:38.526
Yes, it was.

411
00:47:40.561 --> 00:47:43.198
But he didn't tell Miranda.

412
00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:48.836
He said that she
hadn't changed her mind


413
00:47:48.903 --> 00:47:52.407
and it was unlikely
that she would.


414
00:47:54.008 --> 00:47:56.043
Then your wife got sick.

415
00:47:56.110 --> 00:47:57.345
Yes.

416
00:47:59.214 --> 00:48:04.385
I told James that Abigail
wanted to see Miranda.


417
00:48:04.452 --> 00:48:07.355
But he either didn't tell her,

418
00:48:09.089 --> 00:48:10.491
or she was unmoved.

419
00:48:12.059 --> 00:48:16.431
Either way, Abigail died without
ever seeing Miranda again.


420
00:48:18.299 --> 00:48:23.538
Abigail's dying wish was
that I take this Bible


421
00:48:23.604 --> 00:48:26.741
to Miranda and ask
her forgiveness,


422
00:48:28.243 --> 00:48:31.279
and tell her that
we forgive her.


423
00:48:31.346 --> 00:48:32.780
I trust Abigail's true wish

424
00:48:32.847 --> 00:48:35.950
is for Miranda to
turn back to the Lord.


425
00:48:36.016 --> 00:48:38.819
Mothers only want what's
best for their children,


426
00:48:38.886 --> 00:48:41.889
even if we aren't
flesh and blood.


427
00:48:54.001 --> 00:48:57.472
Thank you for
sharing that, Steven.


428
00:49:01.976 --> 00:49:05.446
It's good to
finally tell somebody.


429
00:50:33.534 --> 00:50:36.504
What if she
still won't see me?


430
00:50:39.306 --> 00:50:42.377
Perhaps her
heart has softened.


431
00:50:42.443 --> 00:50:46.313
That would be
wonderful, but I doubt it.


432
00:50:49.283 --> 00:50:51.552
Let's ask God for help,

433
00:50:52.720 --> 00:50:55.222
and hopefully your
daughter will welcome you


434
00:50:55.289 --> 00:50:57.792
with open arms when we arrive.

435
00:51:00.294 --> 00:51:01.562
Absolutely.

436
00:51:12.407 --> 00:51:13.408
Amen.

437
00:51:14.775 --> 00:51:17.412
Now let's get going, you've
got a Bible to deliver.


438
00:51:17.478 --> 00:51:18.513
Yes.

439
00:51:30.558 --> 00:51:34.929
I'm gonna take the pup
for a walk in a few, but...


440
00:51:36.664 --> 00:51:38.499
There's something I need
to talk to you about.


441
00:51:38.566 --> 00:51:40.034
It's important.

442
00:51:42.570 --> 00:51:44.304
It's okay, James,
I forgive you.


443
00:51:44.371 --> 00:51:45.272
It's gonna work out, okay?

444
00:51:45.339 --> 00:51:46.707
Let's just forget about it.

445
00:51:46.774 --> 00:51:48.643
I can't forget about it.

446
00:51:48.709 --> 00:51:51.846
It's something I have to say.

447
00:51:51.912 --> 00:51:53.180
Listen...

448
00:51:53.247 --> 00:51:55.750
You sure you wanna poke
the bear again, really?


449
00:51:55.816 --> 00:51:59.554
Let me start by saying
that I love you very much.


450
00:51:59.620 --> 00:52:03.724
These have been the best
five years of my life.


451
00:52:03.791 --> 00:52:06.060
And I'll be the
first to say that


452
00:52:06.126 --> 00:52:08.896
I probably have no idea
what I'm talking about.


453
00:52:08.963 --> 00:52:14.201
I have great parents, I
had a wonderful childhood,


454
00:52:14.268 --> 00:52:18.138
and it's helped to make me
the man that I am today.


455
00:52:18.205 --> 00:52:20.374
Well so far you haven't
said anything to make me mad,


456
00:52:20.441 --> 00:52:21.676
so go on.

457
00:52:23.544 --> 00:52:25.012
Here goes.

458
00:52:25.079 --> 00:52:27.414
I'm only basing this on
what you've told me, okay?


459
00:52:27.482 --> 00:52:29.684
I don't have any
information from Abigail,


460
00:52:29.750 --> 00:52:31.719
or Steven, or anyone.

461
00:52:36.090 --> 00:52:37.925
You gotta get over yourself.

462
00:52:39.393 --> 00:52:41.161
You have two people
who loved you enough


463
00:52:41.228 --> 00:52:45.132
to give you a home, feed
you, clothe you, educate you,


464
00:52:45.199 --> 00:52:48.102
teach you about God,
and respected the Bible.


465
00:52:48.168 --> 00:52:50.571
And this is how you repay
'em for all their love?


466
00:52:50.638 --> 00:52:51.572
They lied to me!

467
00:52:51.639 --> 00:52:52.873
To protect you!

468
00:52:52.940 --> 00:52:54.341
What, do you think
they were running


469
00:52:54.408 --> 00:52:56.010
some big scam on
you or something?


470
00:52:56.076 --> 00:52:58.112
That's ridic...
They owed me the truth.


471
00:52:58.178 --> 00:52:59.714
They owed you nothing.

472
00:52:59.780 --> 00:53:02.817
They gave of themselves,
freely, they loved you.


473
00:53:02.883 --> 00:53:04.919
And now you can't make
amends with your mother.


474
00:53:04.985 --> 00:53:08.422
That's right, I said
it, your mother.


475
00:53:08.489 --> 00:53:10.124
And now your father's
coming out here,


476
00:53:10.190 --> 00:53:12.326
and you have a big
choice to make.


477
00:53:12.392 --> 00:53:13.694
A big choice.

478
00:53:15.295 --> 00:53:16.631
Make a decision.

479
00:53:52.232 --> 00:53:54.068
Black Dragon Canyon.

480
00:53:57.572 --> 00:54:01.308
You know, Steven, I'm
in no particular hurry,


481
00:54:01.375 --> 00:54:04.411
but if we keep stopping at
every point of interest,


482
00:54:04.478 --> 00:54:07.948
we'll never make
it to Los Angeles.


483
00:54:08.015 --> 00:54:11.752
Okay, I get what
you're saying, let's go.


484
00:55:05.773 --> 00:55:07.642
I was thinking,

485
00:55:07.708 --> 00:55:10.477
if we're gonna be driving
through Las Vegas,


486
00:55:10.544 --> 00:55:13.180
maybe you could
just drop me off.


487
00:55:13.247 --> 00:55:14.749
Well we're headed
in that direction,


488
00:55:14.815 --> 00:55:17.685
but I wasn't planning
on stopping there.


489
00:55:17.752 --> 00:55:20.755
No reason to stop in Las Vegas.

490
00:55:23.658 --> 00:55:27.361
What's so important
in Las Vegas?


491
00:55:27.427 --> 00:55:28.739
I just remembered
I got some business


492
00:55:28.763 --> 00:55:30.898
that I have to take care of.

493
00:55:33.701 --> 00:55:35.936
I'm fairly certain
I can catch a ride.


494
00:55:36.003 --> 00:55:39.674
No shortage of people
going back and forth.


495
00:55:39.740 --> 00:55:42.810
Well, if that's what you want.

496
00:55:43.844 --> 00:55:46.613
Where should I drop you?

497
00:55:46.681 --> 00:55:48.615
Middle of the Strip.

498
00:55:48.683 --> 00:55:49.763
That's where the action is.

499
00:55:51.551 --> 00:55:53.153
Not even close.

500
00:55:54.855 --> 00:55:58.693
There are some people
there that need me.


501
00:56:03.430 --> 00:56:04.775
Well, if it's that
important to you,


502
00:56:04.799 --> 00:56:07.768
that's where I'll drop you off.

503
00:57:15.369 --> 00:57:17.805
Only a few miles out now.

504
00:57:20.808 --> 00:57:24.278
I get the feeling don't
like Las Vegas much.


505
00:57:25.645 --> 00:57:28.515
Gambling, drunkenness,
prostitution?


506
00:57:28.582 --> 00:57:30.851
And that's what they promote.

507
00:57:30.918 --> 00:57:34.688
A modern day
Sodom and Gomorrah.


508
00:57:34.755 --> 00:57:37.724
Yeah, with a
big electric bill.


509
00:57:37.792 --> 00:57:39.259
That's right.

510
00:57:41.829 --> 00:57:45.099
You can just drop me
off and keep driving.


511
00:57:45.165 --> 00:57:49.203
What is so important
about Las Vegas anyway?


512
00:57:51.171 --> 00:57:53.573
Let's just say I
have some work to do


513
00:57:53.640 --> 00:57:56.143
and leave it at that, alright?

514
00:57:58.612 --> 00:57:59.814
I guess we both have things

515
00:57:59.880 --> 00:58:02.649
we'd rather not talk about.

516
00:58:02.716 --> 00:58:04.184
I suppose so.

517
00:58:05.519 --> 00:58:07.021
Let's go.

518
00:58:41.188 --> 00:58:43.390
The New Testament
tells us that often Jesus


519
00:58:43.457 --> 00:58:48.262
and his apostles spent
time among sinners.


520
00:58:48.328 --> 00:58:50.264
Well, if they were
going to spread his word,


521
00:58:50.330 --> 00:58:53.100
that's where they needed to be.

522
00:58:55.970 --> 00:58:59.806
Which is why I need
to go to Las Vegas.


523
00:59:01.175 --> 00:59:03.911
Is that why you're
hitchhiking across country?


524
00:59:03.978 --> 00:59:05.913
To spread the Word?

525
00:59:09.283 --> 00:59:11.818
I have a light to shine
in the darkness, Steven.


526
00:59:11.886 --> 00:59:15.055
Then, why don't
you let me help you?


527
00:59:18.993 --> 00:59:21.929
You have your
own path to walk.


528
00:59:37.677 --> 00:59:42.249
Kinda puts a bit of perspective
on our problems, doesn't it?


529
01:01:06.633 --> 01:01:08.702
Might as well
hold onto that coat.


530
01:01:08.768 --> 01:01:13.240
I hear it gets cold in Las
Vegas, especially at night.


531
01:01:26.086 --> 01:01:28.755
Are you sure you
want to do this?


532
01:01:28.822 --> 01:01:29.822
I am.

533
01:01:32.092 --> 01:01:35.495
Well, seeing as we'll
be parting company,


534
01:01:35.562 --> 01:01:38.465
there's something else
I want to tell you.


535
01:01:41.768 --> 01:01:46.573
When James called to
tell us Miranda was okay,


536
01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:49.009
Abigail wanted to leave
right there and then,


537
01:01:49.076 --> 01:01:52.246
to go to Los Angeles,
but I refused.


538
01:01:59.219 --> 01:02:01.321
I was being prideful.

539
01:02:02.622 --> 01:02:05.959
I told Abigail if
Amanda wanted to see us,


540
01:02:06.026 --> 01:02:07.694
she knew where we lived.

541
01:02:07.761 --> 01:02:12.699
We weren't going to be
the ones who gave in.


542
01:02:12.766 --> 01:02:17.337
Shortly after that, Abigail
was too sick to travel.


543
01:02:19.706 --> 01:02:24.278
I had denied Abigail a
chance to see Miranda again.


544
01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:29.015
She died shortly after that.

545
01:02:34.454 --> 01:02:38.892
Well at least you're
fulfilling her last wish now.


546
01:02:38.958 --> 01:02:41.661
Abigail would be proud of you.

547
01:02:43.963 --> 01:02:44.963
I do.

548
01:02:46.166 --> 01:02:50.137
And I know one day you'll
be united in heaven.


549
01:03:06.586 --> 01:03:08.988
Thank you for the ride, Steven.

550
01:03:09.055 --> 01:03:10.857
You be careful here now.

551
01:03:10.924 --> 01:03:12.926
Thank you, be careful driving.

552
01:03:12.992 --> 01:03:14.261
Oh, I will.

553
01:03:14.328 --> 01:03:16.663
I guess this is goodbye.

554
01:03:16.730 --> 01:03:20.200
Goodbye for now, I'm
sure we'll meet again.


555
01:03:20.267 --> 01:03:21.668
Perhaps.

556
01:03:21.735 --> 01:03:23.903
Good luck to you.

557
01:03:23.970 --> 01:03:25.038
Thank you.

558
01:04:09.216 --> 01:04:10.584
Boy I'm tired.

559
01:04:10.650 --> 01:04:15.155
I think I'm gonna pull
over and take a little nap.


560
01:04:29.969 --> 01:04:32.639
Not ideal, but it'll have to do.

561
01:05:27.261 --> 01:05:30.464
Let me get that,
it could be work.


562
01:05:50.484 --> 01:05:52.151
Hello, James, it's Steven.

563
01:05:52.218 --> 01:05:54.321
Hello, it's good
to hear from you.


564
01:05:54.388 --> 01:05:55.689
Where are you?

565
01:05:56.956 --> 01:05:59.859
I'm at Baker, I'll be
there in about three hours.


566
01:05:59.926 --> 01:06:01.094
That's just fine.

567
01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:02.171
Do you know how to get here?

568
01:06:02.195 --> 01:06:03.397
I've got a map.

569
01:06:03.463 --> 01:06:06.199
If I have any
trouble, I'll call.


570
01:06:06.266 --> 01:06:08.502
Alright, see you
in a few hours.


571
01:06:08.568 --> 01:06:11.671
James, do you
think she'll see me?


572
01:06:12.872 --> 01:06:15.241
I don't know
if she wants to see you,


573
01:06:15.309 --> 01:06:16.843
but she's not going anywhere.

574
01:06:16.910 --> 01:06:20.113
I suppose that'll
have to be good enough.


575
01:06:20.179 --> 01:06:21.281
See you soon.

576
01:06:21.348 --> 01:06:22.382
Bye.

577
01:06:29.989 --> 01:06:31.190
I spoke to Steven.

578
01:06:31.257 --> 01:06:34.394
He's gonna be here
in a few hours.


579
01:06:35.895 --> 01:06:39.032
Listen, maybe I can make
us all something for lunch.


580
01:06:39.098 --> 01:06:40.300
That'd be great.

581
01:06:40.367 --> 01:06:41.611
Listen, I gotta
go to the office.


582
01:06:41.635 --> 01:06:44.438
I'll be back in a
few hours, okay?


583
01:06:44.504 --> 01:06:45.839
Don't be late.

584
01:06:45.905 --> 01:06:47.006
Okay.

585
01:07:27.113 --> 01:07:28.882
Well, this is nice.

586
01:07:43.397 --> 01:07:44.398
Here I go.

587
01:08:09.423 --> 01:08:12.258
Did you forget your
keys again, James?


588
01:08:12.325 --> 01:08:13.493
Hi, Pumpkin.

589
01:08:22.368 --> 01:08:23.603
Hi, Dad.

590
01:08:26.372 --> 01:08:27.373
You wanna come in?

591
01:08:27.441 --> 01:08:29.576
I made some iced tea.

592
01:08:30.376 --> 01:08:31.376
I'd love that.

593
01:09:03.176 --> 01:09:04.611
You look great.

594
01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:07.681
Thanks.

595
01:09:10.550 --> 01:09:13.587
I guess we have a
lot to talk about.


596
01:09:13.653 --> 01:09:18.024
I didn't come here to talk
about the last 25 years.


597
01:09:24.564 --> 01:09:26.633
To bring you this.

598
01:09:36.442 --> 01:09:39.579
It's my Bible
from Sunday School.


599
01:09:42.015 --> 01:09:46.720
Before she died, your
mother wanted me to bring this


600
01:09:46.786 --> 01:09:49.689
and to ask for your forgiveness.

601
01:09:57.797 --> 01:09:59.766
We made a mistake.

602
01:10:02.702 --> 01:10:05.338
Your mother wanted
you to know that,


603
01:10:05.404 --> 01:10:07.741
and to bring you that Bible.

604
01:10:10.677 --> 01:10:15.014
All of this time I've been
so angry at the both of you,


605
01:10:18.618 --> 01:10:20.286
and I'm just
beginning to realize


606
01:10:20.353 --> 01:10:23.022
I had nothing to be angry about.

607
01:10:24.423 --> 01:10:26.125
And now she's gone

608
01:10:30.263 --> 01:10:33.867
and I didn't get the chance
to tell her that I was wrong,


609
01:10:33.933 --> 01:10:36.670
and ask for her forgiveness.

610
01:10:38.972 --> 01:10:43.242
She forgives you, and
one day you'll know that,


611
01:10:44.778 --> 01:10:47.614
because God forgives you too.

612
01:10:50.717 --> 01:10:54.153
I don't pray, I
don't go to church.


613
01:10:54.220 --> 01:10:57.657
Don't you think
it's time to start?


614
01:11:10.336 --> 01:11:16.375
I forgive you Dad,
do you forgive me?


615
01:11:16.442 --> 01:11:21.014
I just drove over 2,000 miles
to tell this to your face.


616
01:11:22.816 --> 01:11:23.883
I forgive you.

617
01:11:37.631 --> 01:11:39.833
Now tell me about James.

618
01:11:58.217 --> 01:12:02.789
Lord, please
help me make a difference.


619
01:12:07.961 --> 01:12:09.796
- Hi, Hon.
- Hey.


620
01:12:10.697 --> 01:12:13.199
This is my husband.

621
01:12:13.266 --> 01:12:14.634
You must be James.

622
01:12:14.701 --> 01:12:17.003
Honey, this is my
father, Steven Campbell.


623
01:12:17.070 --> 01:12:18.180
It's nice to
finally meet you, sir.


624
01:12:18.204 --> 01:12:19.505
You too.

625
01:12:19.572 --> 01:12:21.132
And thanks for helping
make this happen.


626
01:12:21.174 --> 01:12:22.441
You got it.

627
01:12:22.508 --> 01:12:25.144
You were supposed
to be home sooner.


628
01:12:25.211 --> 01:12:26.980
I know, I saw you two
talking on the porch


629
01:12:27.046 --> 01:12:30.717
and I figured to give
you a little time alone.


630
01:12:30.784 --> 01:12:33.052
Thank you, we needed it.

631
01:12:33.119 --> 01:12:34.654
Oh, we did.

632
01:12:34.721 --> 01:12:36.622
I'm going to take
my Bible inside.


633
01:12:36.690 --> 01:12:38.624
Would you like something
to drink, some iced tea?


634
01:12:38.692 --> 01:12:39.859
Yes, please.

635
01:12:40.626 --> 01:12:42.328
What a sweetheart.

636
01:12:44.263 --> 01:12:47.466
It looks like you guys had
a pretty good conversation.


637
01:12:47.533 --> 01:12:50.436
It took a while, but
we found a good place.


638
01:12:50.503 --> 01:12:52.171
And it's all thanks to you.

639
01:12:52.238 --> 01:12:54.507
Well, I just couldn't
see her carrying around


640
01:12:54.573 --> 01:12:56.242
all that anger and pity.

641
01:12:56.309 --> 01:13:00.646
It was really affecting her,
spiritually, emotionally.


642
01:13:00.714 --> 01:13:02.148
She told me she would take

643
01:13:02.215 --> 01:13:05.418
her Bible with her
to church on Sunday.


644
01:13:05.484 --> 01:13:07.653
That makes me very happy.

645
01:13:07.721 --> 01:13:09.989
- There you go.
- Thank you.


646
01:13:10.056 --> 01:13:13.559
So, if you don't have
any plans for this evening,


647
01:13:13.626 --> 01:13:15.161
then how about I cook us dinner?

648
01:13:15.228 --> 01:13:18.297
And of course you're
staying with us.


649
01:13:18.364 --> 01:13:19.598
I appreciate the offer,

650
01:13:19.665 --> 01:13:22.668
but I've already
checked into a hotel


651
01:13:22.736 --> 01:13:24.437
and I have plans for later.

652
01:13:26.740 --> 01:13:28.842
Abigail and I always
wanted to watch the sunset


653
01:13:28.908 --> 01:13:33.412
over the Pacific Ocean, but
never had a chance to do that.


654
01:13:33.479 --> 01:13:35.414
I'm gonna do that this evening.

655
01:13:35.481 --> 01:13:36.349
We can come with you.

656
01:13:36.415 --> 01:13:37.717
Yeah.

657
01:13:37.784 --> 01:13:40.686
No, this is something
I'd rather do by myself.


658
01:13:42.621 --> 01:13:43.990
The nearest beach.

659
01:13:44.057 --> 01:13:46.492
Sunset's in a couple of hours,

660
01:13:46.559 --> 01:13:47.861
I think I'd better get going.

661
01:13:47.927 --> 01:13:52.498
I've experienced LA
traffic first hand.


662
01:13:52.565 --> 01:13:54.233
Alright, let's go.

663
01:14:02.408 --> 01:14:03.786
Tell you what, let
me take you both out


664
01:14:03.810 --> 01:14:05.411
for breakfast in the morning,

665
01:14:05.478 --> 01:14:07.280
then tomorrow night
I'll take you up


666
01:14:07.346 --> 01:14:09.015
on that dinner invitation.

667
01:14:09.082 --> 01:14:11.184
That sounds fine.

668
01:14:11.250 --> 01:14:14.821
Thanks again for
making this happen.


669
01:14:19.859 --> 01:14:21.995
Be safe, take care.

670
01:15:45.611 --> 01:15:50.083
There it is, Abigail,
just like you imagined.


671
01:15:54.120 --> 01:15:58.224
It's a beautiful sunset,
isn't it old friend?


672
01:16:00.026 --> 01:16:02.628
Joseph, what are
you doing here?


673
01:16:02.695 --> 01:16:03.930
Let me tell you a story

674
01:16:03.997 --> 01:16:06.832
as we watch the
light fade together.


675
01:16:06.900 --> 01:16:08.301
About a beloved wife,

676
01:16:08.367 --> 01:16:10.336
who asked for her husband
to join her in heaven


677
01:16:10.403 --> 01:16:15.041
after he finished his final
task of saving your daughter.


678
01:16:15.108 --> 01:16:16.575
Are you an angel?

679
01:16:16.642 --> 01:16:19.612
I was sent here to
accompany you on your journey,


680
01:16:19.678 --> 01:16:24.050
and asked to bring you home
when you were finished.


681
01:16:26.953 --> 01:16:29.255
It's time to go home Steven.

682
01:16:31.557 --> 01:16:36.295
♫ Embracing all the questions
nestled in your head


683
01:16:36.362 --> 01:16:40.633
♫ Right and wrong are concepts
of something you just said


684
01:16:40.699 --> 01:16:45.671
♫ Forgiveness is an idea
you won't give a chance


685
01:16:45.738 --> 01:16:50.109
♫ Your life's a random
series of lonely circumstance


686
01:16:52.278 --> 01:16:56.649
♫ Then something
marvelous occurred


687
01:16:59.818 --> 01:17:04.423
♫ You were guided by the word

688
01:17:04.490 --> 01:17:09.095
♫ From a voice you always heard

689
01:17:09.162 --> 01:17:13.732

01:17:13.799 --> 01:17:18.604
♫ Released you from that cage

01:17:28.681 --> 01:17:32.351
♫ Were passed down from above

694
01:17:33.519 --> 01:17:37.890
♫ Yes, something

♫ Questions now seek answers,
no longer on your mind


697

♫ Right and wrong are concrete
when truth is what you find


698
01:17:59.845 --> 01:18:04.650
♫ Forgiveness is conviction
you hold near your heart


699
01:18:04.717 --> 01:18:09.088
♫ No longer to be seeking
for those you drove apart


700
01:18:11.624 --> 01:18:16.195
♫ Then something
marvelous occurred
