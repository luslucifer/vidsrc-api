system of spotless--


170
00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:41.735
[Cody] Mom, mom!

171
00:12:41.836 --> 00:12:43.270
[Harriet Nelson]
Two detergent washes


172
00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:44.404
plus a few drops of--

173
00:12:44.504 --> 00:12:45.772
[Cody] Mom!

174
00:12:45.873 --> 00:12:47.274
Mom!

175
00:12:47.374 --> 00:12:48.442
Cody?

176
00:12:49.911 --> 00:12:50.845
What happened?

177
00:12:50.878 --> 00:12:52.179
Mom there's a--

178
00:12:52.212 --> 00:12:53.180
there's a monster
outside my window.


179
00:12:53.213 --> 00:12:54.448
No, honey.

180
00:12:54.548 --> 00:12:55.549
You're just having a bad dream.

181
00:12:55.616 --> 00:12:58.418
No, look, look, look, look!

182
00:12:58.518 --> 00:12:59.620
Okay, okay.

183
00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:01.221
Let's see.

184
00:13:01.288 --> 00:13:03.557
No, no monsters out here.

185
00:13:03.624 --> 00:13:05.292
There was a storm
out there, though.


186
00:13:05.392 --> 00:13:08.562
So maybe that's what
scared you, huh?


187
00:13:10.564 --> 00:13:13.266
I know, I was having
a bad dream too.


188
00:13:14.468 --> 00:13:15.736
Was there a monster in it?

189
00:13:15.769 --> 00:13:18.805
Yes, and it was very scary.

190
00:13:20.307 --> 00:13:23.210
But I know that you and I

191
00:13:23.243 --> 00:13:25.245
are completely safe,

192
00:13:25.278 --> 00:13:27.614
like two bugs, snug in a rug.

193
00:13:29.650 --> 00:13:30.751
Okay?

194
00:13:32.086 --> 00:13:33.387
Get some rest, babe.

195
00:13:34.088 --> 00:13:35.288
You got school tomorrow.

196
00:13:35.389 --> 00:13:37.091
I don't want to go to school.

197
00:13:37.125 --> 00:13:38.792
Well, you have to,

198
00:13:38.893 --> 00:13:41.129
Mommy says.

199
00:13:41.228 --> 00:13:43.097
Come on, lie down.

200
00:13:43.131 --> 00:13:44.431
Lay down.

201
00:13:44.498 --> 00:13:46.566
Get some sleep.

202
00:13:51.672 --> 00:13:52.606
Mom,

203
00:13:53.607 --> 00:13:56.110
can you leave the door open?

204
00:13:56.176 --> 00:13:58.913
Of course.

205
00:13:58.946 --> 00:14:01.949
(thunder rumbling)

206
00:14:11.792 --> 00:14:13.928
[Woman] Dr. Weaver's office.
How may I help you?


207
00:14:13.961 --> 00:14:15.997
[Laura] May I speak
to Dr. Weaver please?


208
00:14:16.097 --> 00:14:18.432
[Woman]
I'm sorry, ma'am, this is just
his answering service.


209
00:14:18.465 --> 00:14:21.102
Would you like
to leave a message?


210
00:14:21.135 --> 00:14:24.471
[Laura] No, thank you.

Okay, thank you.

239
00:16:33.267 --> 00:16:34.101
Hi.

240
00:16:34.168 --> 00:16:35.435
Hi.

241
00:16:35.468 --> 00:16:36.469
I'm Laura.

242
00:16:36.570 --> 00:16:37.771
Jane.

243
00:16:37.804 --> 00:16:39.506
It's very nice
to meet you, Jane.


244
00:16:39.606 --> 00:16:41.341
Where'd you get that dress?

245
00:16:41.441 --> 00:16:42.642
Oh, this?

246
00:16:42.742 --> 00:16:44.578
- I...
- (phone rings)


247
00:16:45.179 --> 00:16:46.646
This is Jane.

248
00:16:47.514 --> 00:16:49.482
Yes, sir.
Right away.


249
00:16:50.184 --> 00:16:52.786
(soft music)

250
00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:14.308
Hey, how was your first day?

251
00:17:14.374 --> 00:17:16.310
It was okay.

252
00:17:16.344 --> 00:17:18.012
Did you make any new friends?

253
00:17:19.981 --> 00:17:20.948
No.

254
00:17:20.982 --> 00:17:23.985
Well, I'm sure
you will in no time.


255
00:17:25.385 --> 00:17:27.454
All right, here we go home.

256
00:17:27.487 --> 00:17:30.057
(soft music)

257
00:17:45.805 --> 00:17:48.910
Well, I had a great
first day at work.


258
00:17:49.010 --> 00:17:51.345
The ladies, they're so nice,

259
00:17:51.379 --> 00:17:54.414
Kathy and, um...

260
00:17:54.514 --> 00:17:55.917
Susan.

261
00:17:56.017 --> 00:17:59.020
Well, I just got such
a tickle out of all of them.


262
00:18:00.388 --> 00:18:01.923
Cody, eat your dinner.

263
00:18:03.157 --> 00:18:04.358
I'm not hungry.

264
00:18:04.424 --> 00:18:06.426
Well, try to eat a little.

265
00:18:06.526 --> 00:18:09.763
(phone ringing)

266
00:18:09.864 --> 00:18:11.999
(ominous music)

267
00:18:15.669 --> 00:18:18.372
(ringing continues)

268
00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:26.613
The troll was twice as big as
the biggest Billy goat gruff,


269
00:18:26.713 --> 00:18:28.615
but the Billy goat
was not afraid.


270
00:18:28.715 --> 00:18:31.852
He lowered his horns
and ran at the troll,


271
00:18:31.886 --> 00:18:34.388
pushing him over the bridge.

272
00:18:34.422 --> 00:18:36.357
The troll screamed with fury

273
00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:38.059
as he fell into the water

274
00:18:38.092 --> 00:18:40.261
and was swept away
by the current.


275
00:18:41.228 --> 00:18:43.697
Then, the biggest
Billy goat gruff


276
00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:45.565
joined his family in the meadow

277
00:18:45.598 --> 00:18:47.600
and told them they
never to worry


278
00:18:47.701 --> 00:18:49.937
about crossing the bridge again.

279
00:18:50.037 --> 00:18:51.072
The end.

280
00:18:51.138 --> 00:18:53.074
Read another one.

281
00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:54.241
Sorry.

282
00:18:54.275 --> 00:18:55.608
The time has come

283
00:18:55.709 --> 00:18:58.279
for counting sheep for little
boys who need their sleep.


284
00:19:00.814 --> 00:19:01.781
Now lie down.

285
00:19:01.882 --> 00:19:03.417
You've got school tomorrow.

286
00:19:04.385 --> 00:19:05.618
Got to get some rest.

287
00:19:06.553 --> 00:19:07.922
Goodnight, sweet prince.

288
00:19:15.096 --> 00:19:17.431
Leave the door open, okay?

289
00:19:17.465 --> 00:19:19.133
[Laura] Okay.

290
00:19:19.233 --> 00:19:20.401
Love you.

291
00:19:20.434 --> 00:19:21.469
[Rick]
Hello, Betty?


292
00:19:21.568 --> 00:19:22.736
Betty Ferguson?

293
00:19:22.769 --> 00:19:23.838
[Betty] Yes, who's this?

294
00:19:23.938 --> 00:19:24.905
[Rick] This is Rick Nelson.

295
00:19:24.939 --> 00:19:26.073
[Betty] Oh, David's brother?

296
00:19:26.107 --> 00:19:27.607
- (laughter)
- [Rick] Yeah.


297
00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:28.775
(phone ringing)

298
00:19:28.808 --> 00:19:30.111
Say, what time do you want me

299
00:19:30.177 --> 00:19:31.678
to pick you up for
the dance Friday night?


300
00:19:31.778 --> 00:19:32.947
[Betty] Oh, well, 8:30
would just be wonderful.


301
00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:34.482
[Rick]
Hey, I found her.


302
00:19:34.581 --> 00:19:36.716
Okay, I'll be there
at 8:30...


303
00:19:36.816 --> 00:19:39.286
- Hello?
- [Man] Laura?


304
00:19:40.587 --> 00:19:41.989
[Harriet Nelson]
I thought my own


305
00:19:42.089 --> 00:19:43.690
Hotpoint dishwasher
was wonderful,


306
00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:46.127
but this new one is
the greatest ever...


307
00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:49.463
[Laura] It uses a new system
of spotless cleansing,


308
00:19:49.497 --> 00:19:51.132
two detergent washes

309
00:19:51.165 --> 00:19:54.468
and a few drops of this
special wetting agent


310
00:19:54.534 --> 00:19:56.137
squirted automatically.

311
00:19:56.170 --> 00:19:58.805
(eerie music)

312
00:20:31.338 --> 00:20:34.008
(water dripping)

313
00:20:42.883 --> 00:20:45.986
(phone ringing)

314
00:20:50.157 --> 00:20:51.258
Hello?

315
00:20:51.358 --> 00:20:52.226
[Mother] Laura.

316
00:20:52.326 --> 00:20:53.427
Mother.

317
00:20:53.527 --> 00:20:54.862
Mother, how could you
give Scott my number?


318
00:20:54.929 --> 00:20:56.063
[Woman] Cody.

319
00:20:56.163 --> 00:20:57.198
[Mother]
Laura, where have you been?


320
00:20:57.264 --> 00:20:58.698
[Laura]
He just called here.


321
00:20:58.731 --> 00:21:00.401
How could you do that?

322
00:21:00.501 --> 00:21:01.869
[Mother] I didn't
give him your number.


323
00:21:01.936 --> 00:21:03.404
I only gave it
to a few of your friends.


324
00:21:03.504 --> 00:21:04.538
Why?

325
00:21:04.604 --> 00:21:05.772
Why would you do that?

326
00:21:05.873 --> 00:21:08.275
I told you
not to give it to anyone.


327
00:21:08.375 --> 00:21:09.609
[Mother]
They're your friends.


328
00:21:09.709 --> 00:21:11.345
Did you give him
my address too?


329
00:21:11.378 --> 00:21:12.546
Is he gonna come here?

330
00:21:12.612 --> 00:21:13.914
[Mother] He's not going
to come there, Laura.


331
00:21:14.014 --> 00:21:15.682
He just wants
to talk to you.


332
00:21:15.715 --> 00:21:16.917
He feels so bad.

333
00:21:16.951 --> 00:21:19.253
I don't care how he feels.

334
00:21:19.353 --> 00:21:21.889
I don't know how you
can even speak to him


335
00:21:21.922 --> 00:21:23.090
after what he did.

336
00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:26.393
You're supposed
to be on our side.


337
00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:28.229
Grandma would be.

338
00:21:28.262 --> 00:21:30.464
[Mother] Of course
we're on your side, Laura.


339
00:21:30.564 --> 00:21:31.866
[Laura] No you're not.

340
00:21:31.899 --> 00:21:32.699
[Mother] Honey, why don't
I come and stay with you


341
00:21:32.732 --> 00:21:34.068
for a while?

342
00:21:34.135 --> 00:21:36.070
[Laura]
No. No.


343
00:21:36.137 --> 00:21:37.938
I don't need any help.
Everything's perfect.


344
00:21:38.038 --> 00:21:40.941
(eerie music)

345
00:21:57.391 --> 00:21:59.326
(Cody screaming)

346
00:21:59.426 --> 00:22:01.428
[Cody] Mom!

347
00:22:01.495 --> 00:22:02.096
[Laura] Cody.

348
00:22:02.163 --> 00:22:03.330
Cody, what's wrong?

349
00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:04.664
[Cody] There was
a monster in my room.


350
00:22:04.764 --> 00:22:06.600
[Laura] It's okay.
It's okay.


351
00:22:06.666 --> 00:22:08.169
You're okay.

352
00:22:08.269 --> 00:22:09.904
[Cody] Mom, the monster
from the pond was in my room!


353
00:22:09.937 --> 00:22:11.906
[Laura] Honey,
there's no monster.


354
00:22:11.939 --> 00:22:13.307
You're just having a bad dream.

355
00:22:13.407 --> 00:22:14.441
[Cody] You're not
listening to me.


356
00:22:14.508 --> 00:22:15.943
It was right here.

357
00:22:16.010 --> 00:22:17.111
[Laura] It doesn't
feel like a dream,


358
00:22:17.178 --> 00:22:19.613
I know,
but it was, I promise.


359
00:22:19.647 --> 00:22:20.981
[Cody] The monster was here.

360
00:22:21.081 --> 00:22:23.584
(soft music)

361
00:23:41.862 --> 00:23:44.732
As I yearn to return to you,

362
00:23:44.832 --> 00:23:48.035
so will you yearn
to return to me.


363
00:23:49.403 --> 00:23:51.605
When our paths do cross again,

364
00:23:51.705 --> 00:23:54.108
our hearts will
entwined with ecstasy.


365
00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:02.049
Laura,

366
00:24:02.082 --> 00:24:04.518
I thought you were
Mrs. Seton's ghost.


367
00:24:04.551 --> 00:24:05.953
No, Grandma.

368
00:24:06.053 --> 00:24:07.554
She doesn't like
it in the attic.


369
00:24:07.588 --> 00:24:09.757
I only ever see her
in the basement.


370
00:24:09.857 --> 00:24:11.558
Me too.

371
00:24:11.592 --> 00:24:14.261
Where did you find
this old thing?


372
00:24:17.531 --> 00:24:19.566
Ugh. Is he really
worth the effort?


373
00:24:20.934 --> 00:24:23.404
Oh, honey, don't cry.

374
00:24:23.437 --> 00:24:27.141
I can't even imagine how hard
it is to be young these days.


375
00:24:27.241 --> 00:24:29.410
It was so much simpler
back in my time.


376
00:24:29.443 --> 00:24:31.979
I wish I could take
you back there with me.


377
00:24:32.913 --> 00:24:34.214
I wish I could too.

378
00:24:35.049 --> 00:24:36.317
You'd fit right in.

379
00:24:37.918 --> 00:24:39.586
[Young Laura]
Thanks, Grandma.


380
00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:43.257
(ethereal music)

381
00:24:50.998 --> 00:24:54.068
(water dripping)

382
00:25:02.609 --> 00:25:04.111
[Receptionist]
This is Dr. Weaver's office.


383
00:25:04.178 --> 00:25:05.612
How may I help you?

384
00:25:05.646 --> 00:25:07.081
Hi, Francine?

385
00:25:07.114 --> 00:25:08.015
It's Laura Butler.

386
00:25:08.115 --> 00:25:09.016
[Francine] Hi, Laura.

387
00:25:09.116 --> 00:25:10.351
We've been trying to reach you.

388
00:25:10.451 --> 00:25:12.453
Oh, Dr. Weaver just
walked in, hold on.


389
00:25:12.519 --> 00:25:14.922
[Dr. Weaver]
Laura, how are you?


390
00:25:14.955 --> 00:25:16.457
Hi, Doctor.

391
00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:20.828
I don't know.

392
00:25:20.928 --> 00:25:22.296
[Dr. Weaver]
What's going on?


393
00:25:24.131 --> 00:25:25.299
Scott called.

394
00:25:26.266 --> 00:25:27.534
[Dr. Weaver] Are you
having the dreams again?


395
00:25:27.634 --> 00:25:28.837
Yeah.

396
00:25:28.936 --> 00:25:33.040
I'm wondering if maybe I
should go back on medication.


397
00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:34.808
[Dr. Weaver] You know,
I prefer we didn't


398
00:25:34.875 --> 00:25:36.643
handle them through medication.

399
00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:38.045
Can you come in today?

400
00:25:38.145 --> 00:25:40.180
No, I'm out of town.

401
00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:41.715
[Dr. Weaver] Where are you?

402
00:25:42.616 --> 00:25:43.650
Laura?

403
00:25:44.985 --> 00:25:46.220
I'm here.

404
00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:47.821
[Dr. Weaver] Where are you?

405
00:25:49.623 --> 00:25:53.193
You know, I think
I'm just being silly.


406
00:25:53.293 --> 00:25:55.562
Everything will be fine.

407
00:25:55.662 --> 00:25:58.232
- Thank you, Doctor.
- Laura?


408
00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:01.836
Cody, hurry up.

409
00:26:01.870 --> 00:26:03.203
We're going to be late.

410
00:26:09.343 --> 00:26:11.678
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.


411
00:26:12.713 --> 00:26:14.348
What can I do for you?

412
00:26:14.381 --> 00:26:16.016
Well, I just wanted to
let you know that the,


413
00:26:16.049 --> 00:26:18.218
the kitchen sink was leaking.

414
00:26:18.318 --> 00:26:20.087
So I turned off the water.

415
00:26:20.187 --> 00:26:23.157
Probably just need
your new seed washer.


416
00:26:23.190 --> 00:26:25.826
I'll come by and take a look.

417
00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:27.094
Thank you.

418
00:26:27.194 --> 00:26:31.565
And also the television
sort of popped


419
00:26:32.766 --> 00:26:34.234
and now it's not working.

420
00:26:34.334 --> 00:26:36.370
We're not responsible
for the television.


421
00:26:36.437 --> 00:26:39.206
Well, now, Lenora, I'd go
by and take a look at it.


422
00:26:39.239 --> 00:26:42.042
Well, but she's going to
have to pay for the parts


423
00:26:42.075 --> 00:26:43.845
and the television
was left behind.


424
00:26:43.878 --> 00:26:45.045
It's not part of the house.

425
00:26:45.112 --> 00:26:46.380
That's okay.

426
00:26:46.447 --> 00:26:48.917
If you wouldn't mind
just taking a look.


427
00:26:49.016 --> 00:26:50.050
Will do.

428
00:26:50.083 --> 00:26:51.251
Okay.

429
00:26:51.318 --> 00:26:52.453
Well, have a nice day.

430
00:26:52.553 --> 00:26:54.421
[Mr. Langtree]
You as well, young lady.


431
00:26:57.892 --> 00:26:59.226
That's how it starts.

432
00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:02.229
[Harriet Nelson] I thought
my own Hotpoint dishwasher


433
00:27:02.296 --> 00:27:03.564
was wonderful,

434
00:27:03.597 --> 00:27:05.732
but this new one is
the greatest ever.


435
00:27:05.766 --> 00:27:08.235
It uses a new system
of spotless cleanser,


436
00:27:08.302 --> 00:27:09.904
two detergent washes,

437
00:27:09.970 --> 00:27:12.573
plus a few drops of this
special wetting agent


438
00:27:12.606 --> 00:27:14.943
squirted automatically in
the second rinse water.


439
00:27:15.042 --> 00:27:16.443
And do you know what this does?

440
00:27:16.543 --> 00:27:19.813
It makes it impossible for
water to collect in drops


441
00:27:19.914 --> 00:27:20.949
on your dishes.

442
00:27:21.048 --> 00:27:22.483
You get spotless dry,

443
00:27:22.583 --> 00:27:24.618
even on glasses and silver.

444
00:27:24.651 --> 00:27:26.587
Everything is sparkling clean

445
00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:28.755
when it's washed in a Hotpoint.

446
00:27:28.822 --> 00:27:31.425
(soft music)

447
00:27:34.828 --> 00:27:36.263
[Woman] Cody.

448
00:27:51.913 --> 00:27:54.448
[Man] Turn to the classified
pages of your phone book.


449
00:27:54.481 --> 00:27:56.083
That's where you will find

450
00:27:56.116 --> 00:27:58.585
your nearest Hotpoint dealer.

451
00:27:58.619 --> 00:28:00.787
(soft music)

452
00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:09.796
(eerie music)

453
00:28:31.351 --> 00:28:32.519
- (buzzing)
- Refrigerators,


454
00:28:32.619 --> 00:28:34.688
automatic washers and--

455
00:28:36.156 --> 00:28:39.526
(electricity buzzing)

456
00:28:42.462 --> 00:28:45.332
(dog barking)

457
00:28:56.978 --> 00:28:59.680
(wind blowing)

458
00:29:17.031 --> 00:29:20.567
(Cody breathing heavily)

459
00:29:23.871 --> 00:29:26.573
(wind blowing)

460
00:29:32.379 --> 00:29:37.584
- (eerie music)
- (dog barking)


461
00:29:47.394 --> 00:29:50.464
(eerie whispering)

462
00:29:53.101 --> 00:29:55.903
(wood creaking)

463
00:29:58.238 --> 00:30:00.875
(eerie music)

464
00:30:24.464 --> 00:30:27.434
(eerie droning)

465
00:31:06.473 --> 00:31:08.976
(screaming)

466
00:31:31.165 --> 00:31:32.066
Cody!

467
00:31:33.633 --> 00:31:36.470
(screaming)

468
00:31:47.514 --> 00:31:49.316
(glass breaks)

469
00:31:49.349 --> 00:31:52.385
(Cody screaming)

470
00:32:05.265 --> 00:32:08.435
Cody!

471
00:32:11.571 --> 00:32:13.607
I want to go home.

472
00:32:21.849 --> 00:32:22.549
Amber.

473
00:32:22.616 --> 00:32:24.051
Is this you?

474
00:32:24.118 --> 00:32:25.086
You did this?

475
00:32:25.186 --> 00:32:26.453
Are you sure?

476
00:32:38.598 --> 00:32:39.800
So I thought maybe you

477
00:32:39.901 --> 00:32:41.301
had come by the
house for something.


478
00:32:41.401 --> 00:32:43.303
No, no, probably a raccoon.

479
00:32:43.403 --> 00:32:45.405
They climb all over the place.

480
00:32:45.472 --> 00:32:47.541
Bunch of pests.

481
00:32:47.574 --> 00:32:50.111
No, I don't think
this was a raccoon.


482
00:32:50.211 --> 00:32:53.446
My son said that he saw
something down by the pond.


483
00:32:53.547 --> 00:32:54.949
He's not supposed
to be at the pond.


484
00:32:55.049 --> 00:32:56.449
I don't want him
playing near there.


485
00:32:56.550 --> 00:32:58.152
[Laura] Yes, I know.
I have, uh,


486
00:32:58.252 --> 00:32:59.954
I've already told him
to stay away from it.


487
00:33:00.054 --> 00:33:01.588
I can set some traps
from the raccoons.


488
00:33:01.655 --> 00:33:05.092
Again, I really don't
think it was a raccoon.


489
00:33:05.126 --> 00:33:07.661
So I don't think that
that would be helpful.


490
00:33:07.761 --> 00:33:11.999
Oh, but I did manage
to lock myself out


491
00:33:12.099 --> 00:33:14.434
of the house last night when
I went to investigate and--


492
00:33:14.501 --> 00:33:15.937
Wait, that's impossible.

493
00:33:15.970 --> 00:33:17.637
The door doesn't
lock on its own--


494
00:33:17.737 --> 00:33:18.940
Well, then I
guess it was stuck.


495
00:33:18.973 --> 00:33:20.308
- Well you need--
- Anyway.


496
00:33:20.407 --> 00:33:23.277
I had to break the window
on the door to get in.


497
00:33:23.343 --> 00:33:25.246
So I'm so sorry.

498
00:33:25.279 --> 00:33:26.280
We already fixed the sink.

499
00:33:26.346 --> 00:33:27.514
We're not paying
for that window.


500
00:33:27.614 --> 00:33:28.748
You broke it.

501
00:33:28.782 --> 00:33:31.785
Of course I will
pay for the window.


502
00:33:31.818 --> 00:33:33.921
Anytime you can stop by.

503
00:33:33.955 --> 00:33:35.156
[Mr. Langtree]
Don't you worry.


504
00:33:35.256 --> 00:33:36.190
I'll take care of it.

505
00:33:36.290 --> 00:33:37.524
Thank you.

506
00:33:37.624 --> 00:33:39.961
(soft music)

507
00:33:44.198 --> 00:33:45.532
Hey, how was your day?

508
00:33:45.632 --> 00:33:48.169
(soft music)

509
00:33:54.008 --> 00:33:56.110
You're not still
mad at me, are you?


510
00:33:57.945 --> 00:34:00.281
Honey, I said I was sorry.

511
00:34:03.617 --> 00:34:05.152
How about some ice cream?

512
00:34:05.186 --> 00:34:06.320
Huh?

513
00:34:06.354 --> 00:34:07.321
Yeah.

514
00:34:07.355 --> 00:34:10.291
Cody, why don't you go play?

515
00:34:10.324 --> 00:34:11.158
This looks fun.

516
00:34:11.225 --> 00:34:11.993
Kickball.

517
00:34:12.026 --> 00:34:13.393
Why don't you go play with them?

518
00:34:13.493 --> 00:34:14.996
[Cody] They're friends.

519
00:34:15.029 --> 00:34:17.397
Well, this kid's
all by himself.


520
00:34:17.497 --> 00:34:18.833
He looks like he
could use a friend.


521
00:34:18.900 --> 00:34:20.334
Why don't you go
ask him to play?


522
00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:21.836
[Cody] He's a dipstick.

523
00:34:21.903 --> 00:34:25.538
Well, maybe you could
help him be a better person.


524
00:34:25.639 --> 00:34:26.706
Right?

525
00:34:27.674 --> 00:34:29.343
Go on.
Go ask him to play.


526
00:34:29.409 --> 00:34:30.477
I'll hold your ice cream.

527
00:34:30.510 --> 00:34:31.544
[Cody] I don't want to.

528
00:34:31.645 --> 00:34:33.047
Go on, ask him to play.

529
00:34:40.154 --> 00:34:42.056
(horn honking)

530
00:34:42.156 --> 00:34:44.758
(eerie music)

531
00:34:49.163 --> 00:34:50.197
Let's go.

532
00:34:50.231 --> 00:34:51.832
What happened?
He didn't want to play?


533
00:34:51.866 --> 00:34:53.000
No, I told you, let's go.

534
00:34:53.034 --> 00:34:54.402
Cody, did he say
something to you?


535
00:34:54.501 --> 00:34:55.937
No, God, forget it, okay?

536
00:34:56.037 --> 00:34:57.338
Cody.

537
00:34:57.371 --> 00:35:00.041
(soft music)

538
00:35:24.398 --> 00:35:26.233
Cody, I know you're
not happy here.


539
00:35:26.267 --> 00:35:30.404
We are not going back to
Mesa and you know why.


540
00:35:30.438 --> 00:35:32.907
[Cody] Because you hate Dad.

541
00:35:32.940 --> 00:35:34.641
No, I don't hate Dad.

542
00:35:34.741 --> 00:35:36.043
I hate what Dad did to us.

543
00:35:36.077 --> 00:35:38.312
And I'm going to make very sure

544
00:35:38.412 --> 00:35:39.779
that he can never hurt us again.

545
00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:42.816
Well, I forgive him.

546
00:35:47.587 --> 00:35:49.924
I'm so proud of you for that.

547
00:35:52.659 --> 00:35:54.328
But I'm not ready.

548
00:35:56.464 --> 00:35:58.065
Maybe someday.

549
00:35:59.632 --> 00:36:01.268
In the meantime,

550
00:36:01.302 --> 00:36:05.239
can we try to be
happy living here?


551
00:36:06.773 --> 00:36:08.742
Please?

552
00:36:12.313 --> 00:36:14.281
What you drawing?

553
00:36:14.315 --> 00:36:16.283
The pretty lady.

554
00:36:16.350 --> 00:36:17.852
[Laura] What pretty lady?

555
00:36:17.952 --> 00:36:19.286
From the pond.

556
00:36:20.087 --> 00:36:22.256
I thought you said it
was a monster in the pond.


557
00:36:23.290 --> 00:36:25.092
I thought there was
a monster in the pond,


558
00:36:25.126 --> 00:36:29.296
but then she came to my
room and talked to me.


559
00:36:29.330 --> 00:36:31.132
(eerie music)

560
00:36:31.198 --> 00:36:33.000
Now I understand.

561
00:36:36.770 --> 00:36:38.973
[Laura] Understand what?

562
00:36:41.608 --> 00:36:42.709
Come meet her, Mom.

563
00:36:42.809 --> 00:36:45.479
Come talk to her.

564
00:36:45.513 --> 00:36:47.148
Let's go to the pond.

565
00:36:47.181 --> 00:36:49.816
I don't wanna go to the pond.

566
00:36:50.885 --> 00:36:53.287
Well, then I guess she'll
just have to come to you.


567
00:36:53.954 --> 00:36:55.622
You know what I would love?

568
00:36:55.655 --> 00:36:57.058
I would love it

569
00:36:57.158 --> 00:36:59.994
if you would draw me
a picture of your school or,


570
00:37:00.027 --> 00:37:01.395
or what about a bird?

571
00:37:01.495 --> 00:37:03.998
And we can put your
drawings up on the fridge.


572
00:37:05.466 --> 00:37:07.234
It'll look so nice.

573
00:37:07.334 --> 00:37:09.870
(soft music)

574
00:37:35.496 --> 00:37:38.731
(electricity flickering)

575
00:37:38.833 --> 00:37:41.068
(eerie music)

576
00:38:02.022 --> 00:38:05.392
(electricity buzzing)

577
00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:08.628
(eerie music)

578
00:38:08.728 --> 00:38:11.465
(phone ringing)

579
00:38:19.039 --> 00:38:21.876
(eerie music)

580
00:38:31.952 --> 00:38:33.587
(screaming)

581
00:38:33.621 --> 00:38:36.257
(eerie music)

582
00:39:05.886 --> 00:39:08.255
(gasping)

583
00:39:38.552 --> 00:39:40.621
[Cody] Did you
see the pretty lady?


584
00:39:40.654 --> 00:39:42.523
Did she talk to you, Mom?

585
00:39:42.623 --> 00:39:44.291
Cody, go to sleep.

586
00:39:45.993 --> 00:39:47.494
[Cody] I love you, Mom.

587
00:39:47.561 --> 00:39:50.164
(soft music)

588
00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:08.215
[Laura] Cody.

589
00:40:09.350 --> 00:40:11.185
Cody.

590
00:40:11.218 --> 00:40:12.586
I said lunch was ready.

591
00:40:12.686 --> 00:40:14.355
Okay.

592
00:40:17.725 --> 00:40:19.360
[Laura] That's enough.

593
00:40:19.426 --> 00:40:20.827
Give it back!

594
00:40:20.861 --> 00:40:23.897
(dramatic music)

595
00:40:24.732 --> 00:40:26.367
Cody Richard Butler.

596
00:40:26.433 --> 00:40:29.403
Don't you ever do that again.

597
00:40:31.372 --> 00:40:32.906
Cody.

598
00:40:33.007 --> 00:40:34.675
Why are you so angry at me?

599
00:40:36.210 --> 00:40:37.444
I can't tell you.

600
00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:41.781
Is it about your birthday?

601
00:40:41.882 --> 00:40:43.517
I didn't forget.

602
00:40:44.551 --> 00:40:45.619
[Cody] My birthday?

603
00:40:46.587 --> 00:40:49.256
I was going to ask you
what you wanted to do.


604
00:40:52.726 --> 00:40:54.561
Anything but that.

605
00:40:59.566 --> 00:41:01.068
Hey, I was thinking,

606
00:41:01.135 --> 00:41:02.636
how about we have a party?

607
00:41:03.704 --> 00:41:04.705
We can,

608
00:41:04.738 --> 00:41:06.307
we can have balloons

609
00:41:06.407 --> 00:41:08.876
and ice cream and
cake and presents,


610
00:41:08.909 --> 00:41:11.979
and we can invite
your entire class.


611
00:41:13.247 --> 00:41:16.450
It'll be a gas, right?

612
00:41:20.721 --> 00:41:22.389
Okay.

613
00:41:24.091 --> 00:41:25.825
Okay.

614
00:41:26.727 --> 00:41:28.896
[Harriet Nelson] I don't
mind, though. Keeps him happy.


615
00:41:28.929 --> 00:41:32.900
I'm sure our
Hotpoint refrigerator
doesn't mind either...


616
00:41:32.933 --> 00:41:35.769
Hey, he looks just
like Roy Rogers.


617
00:41:35.836 --> 00:41:37.638
You like Roy Rogers, right?

618
00:41:38.405 --> 00:41:39.740
[Harriet Nelson] I have
a feeling it'll be with us


619
00:41:39.773 --> 00:41:42.109
long after Dave and Ricky
are grown up and married.


620
00:41:42.142 --> 00:41:44.611
And I love the way our
Hotpoint's designed too.


621
00:41:44.678 --> 00:41:46.680
It could've been...

622
00:41:46.780 --> 00:41:48.349
(eerie music)

623
00:41:48.449 --> 00:41:50.818
All the interior arrangements
are so practical.


624
00:41:50.918 --> 00:41:53.520
(eerie music)

625
00:42:02.696 --> 00:42:04.598
Why don't you talk to
your Hotpoint dealer today


626
00:42:04.631 --> 00:42:07.468
about a refrigerator like
this for your family?


627
00:42:07.501 --> 00:42:10.704
[Man] Turn to the classified
pages of your phone book.


628
00:42:10.804 --> 00:42:14.675
That's where you will find
your nearest Hotpoint dealer.


629
00:42:14.775 --> 00:42:17.378
(eerie music)

630
00:42:21.850 --> 00:42:23.317
There.

631
00:42:24.518 --> 00:42:27.187
Now there are exactly
enough invitations


632
00:42:27.287 --> 00:42:28.822
for every kid in your class.

633
00:42:28.857 --> 00:42:31.792
So I want you to make sure
that everyone gets one, okay?


634
00:42:31.825 --> 00:42:33.193
They won't come.

635
00:42:33.293 --> 00:42:34.863
Of course they will.

636
00:42:34.962 --> 00:42:36.730
Everyone loves a party.

637
00:42:36.831 --> 00:42:39.466
- Can I invite the pretty lady?
- Who?


638
00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:41.068
The pretty lady from the pond.

639
00:42:41.168 --> 00:42:44.505
No.
No, you can't.


640
00:42:45.506 --> 00:42:47.975
Why not?
She's my best friend.


641
00:42:48.008 --> 00:42:49.977
She said that she
would take me home.


642
00:42:50.010 --> 00:42:52.546
Cody.

643
00:42:52.646 --> 00:42:54.648
This is your home.

644
00:42:54.681 --> 00:42:55.983
Okay?

645
00:42:56.016 --> 00:42:58.018
If you would just
talk to her, Mom.


646
00:42:58.051 --> 00:42:59.386
Cody, that's enough.

647
00:42:59.453 --> 00:43:01.688
Clean up your toys.
It's almost bedtime.


648
00:43:05.192 --> 00:43:08.529
♪ She'll be coming around
the mountain when she comes ♪


649
00:43:08.562 --> 00:43:11.665
♪ She'll be coming around

652

♪ She'll be coming around

653
00:43:21.442 --> 00:43:25.045
(electricity buzzing)

654
00:43:25.112 --> 00:43:27.681
Here she comes.

655
00:43:27.714 --> 00:43:32.386
(thud)

656
00:43:32.453 --> 00:43:33.922
Cody.

657
00:43:34.588 --> 00:43:36.056
Go upstairs,
hide in your closet.


658
00:43:36.089 --> 00:43:37.357
Do not make a sound.

659
00:43:37.391 --> 00:43:38.692
No, it's okay, Mom.
It's okay.


660
00:43:38.725 --> 00:43:40.727
- Listen to me. Don't be afraid!
- Cody, just go.


661
00:43:40.794 --> 00:43:43.430
(tense music)

662
00:44:00.747 --> 00:44:02.749
(electricity buzzing)

663
00:44:02.816 --> 00:44:05.452
(tense music)

664
00:44:06.353 --> 00:44:09.156
(eerie music)

665
00:44:41.121 --> 00:44:43.958
Cody, are you okay?

666
00:44:43.992 --> 00:44:46.293
(eerie music)

667
00:45:11.853 --> 00:45:14.388
(screeching)

668
00:45:31.906 --> 00:45:34.508
Mom. Mom.

669
00:45:35.977 --> 00:45:38.512
Mom, Mom.

670
00:45:39.914 --> 00:45:41.315
You fell down.

671
00:45:45.019 --> 00:45:46.988
Come on.
Come on.


672
00:45:50.724 --> 00:45:53.427
- Mom, what are you doing?
- Get in the car.


673
00:45:53.527 --> 00:45:55.596
- Why?
- Just get in.


674
00:45:55.696 --> 00:45:58.699
- But, Mom--
- Get in the car!


675
00:46:01.368 --> 00:46:03.203
- Where are we going?
- Anywhere but here.


676
00:46:03.270 --> 00:46:04.571
But why?
Because she scared you?


677
00:46:04.671 --> 00:46:06.007
She didn't mean
to scare you, Mom.


678
00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:07.075
Be quiet, Cody!

679
00:46:07.174 --> 00:46:08.508
You need to talk to her,
Mom.


680
00:46:08.542 --> 00:46:09.576
She would never hurt you.
She wouldn't hurt anyone!


681
00:46:09.676 --> 00:46:11.244
Enough, Cody!
Enough!


682
00:46:11.345 --> 00:46:12.713
I don't not know
what that thing is


683
00:46:12.746 --> 00:46:14.381
but you are never
talking to it again.


684
00:46:14.414 --> 00:46:15.716
Do you understand?
Ever!


685
00:46:15.749 --> 00:46:17.018
[Cody] Are you
gonna take me home?


686
00:46:17.051 --> 00:46:19.419
No, goddammit,
for the hundredth time.


687
00:46:19.519 --> 00:46:21.055
We're not going home.

688
00:46:21.121 --> 00:46:22.456
Stop talking about that.

689
00:46:22.556 --> 00:46:24.224
Then where are we going?

690
00:46:24.257 --> 00:46:26.894
(tense music)

691
00:46:28.528 --> 00:46:30.263
(engine struggling)

692
00:46:30.364 --> 00:46:31.899
What am I supposed to do?

693
00:46:31.933 --> 00:46:34.301
(sobbing)

694
00:46:36.637 --> 00:46:39.740
What am I supposed to do?

695
00:46:44.378 --> 00:46:45.980
It's okay, Mom.

696
00:46:46.881 --> 00:46:47.882
She's gone.

697
00:46:49.549 --> 00:46:51.752
I'll tell her not
to bother you anymore.


698
00:46:53.387 --> 00:46:54.588
Okay?

699
00:46:54.621 --> 00:46:56.623
You should go to bed.
You're tired.


700
00:46:57.491 --> 00:47:01.129
I'll stay with you, okay?

701
00:47:01.228 --> 00:47:03.664
We'll be all right.

702
00:47:03.764 --> 00:47:06.000
I promise.

703
00:47:06.100 --> 00:47:07.467
We're gonna be all right.

704
00:47:07.567 --> 00:47:10.437
(gentle music)

705
00:47:38.799 --> 00:47:40.701
You ready?

706
00:47:42.502 --> 00:47:44.805
Now, I want you
to give these out


707
00:47:44.839 --> 00:47:46.974
as soon as you get
to school, okay?


708
00:47:47.008 --> 00:47:48.375
- Okay.
- Okay.


709
00:47:48.475 --> 00:47:51.012
Put 'em right in here.

710
00:47:55.950 --> 00:47:58.652
(gentle music)

711
00:48:06.326 --> 00:48:07.828
Hello, operator,

712
00:48:07.895 --> 00:48:11.798
will you connect me with
St. Mary's church please?


713
00:48:12.566 --> 00:48:13.400
Thank you.

714
00:48:13.500 --> 00:48:14.501
[Woman] Saint Mary's.

715
00:48:14.534 --> 00:48:16.003
Sister Agnes speaking.

716
00:48:16.070 --> 00:48:17.237
Hi.

717
00:48:17.337 --> 00:48:20.007
I was wondering if there
might be someone available


718
00:48:20.074 --> 00:48:22.877
to speak with me?

719
00:48:22.977 --> 00:48:24.678
I, I think...

720
00:48:25.312 --> 00:48:30.017
I think I have a demon
or something in my house.


721
00:48:31.085 --> 00:48:33.020
(phone clicks)

722
00:48:33.054 --> 00:48:35.857
Hello?

723
00:48:35.890 --> 00:48:37.758
Hello?

724
00:48:40.527 --> 00:48:43.164
(eerie music)

725
00:48:58.179 --> 00:49:00.680
(soft music)

726
00:49:03.784 --> 00:49:05.219
Is Mr. Langtree available?

727
00:49:05.253 --> 00:49:08.256
[Mrs. Langtree] Why,
what'd you break this time?


728
00:49:08.355 --> 00:49:10.057
Oh.
Nothing, nothing.


729
00:49:10.124 --> 00:49:11.893
I just, um...

730
00:49:13.928 --> 00:49:15.963
I don't, I don't know
exactly how to say this.


731
00:49:16.063 --> 00:49:17.932
[Mrs. Langtree]
Well, just say it.


732
00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:21.735
Has anyone ever said

733
00:49:21.768 --> 00:49:25.907
that there's something
wrong with the house?


734
00:49:26.807 --> 00:49:29.210
[Mrs. Langtree]
What are you up to, missy?


735
00:49:30.244 --> 00:49:31.611
[Laura] What do you mean?

736
00:49:31.711 --> 00:49:33.413
Because you knew exactly
what you were getting into


737
00:49:33.446 --> 00:49:34.815
when you moved
into the house.


738
00:49:34.916 --> 00:49:37.251
So if you think that you
can come sashaying in here


739
00:49:37.317 --> 00:49:38.986
in that little skirt

740
00:49:39.086 --> 00:49:41.923
and con us into putting a whole
bunch of money into that place,


741
00:49:41.956 --> 00:49:44.091
my husband might be stupid
enough to fall for that,


742
00:49:44.125 --> 00:49:45.159
but I'm not.

743
00:49:45.259 --> 00:49:46.994
[Laura] I'm not
trying to do anything.


744
00:49:47.094 --> 00:49:48.662
Well, I don't know
what you're doing here


745
00:49:48.762 --> 00:49:50.764
in the first place, unless
you're hiding something.


746
00:49:50.797 --> 00:49:53.100
I am trying to ask you...

747
00:49:54.601 --> 00:49:57.470
if there's a ghost
in the house.


748
00:49:57.571 --> 00:49:59.240
A ghost!

749
00:49:59.273 --> 00:50:00.440
Is it drugs?

750
00:50:00.507 --> 00:50:02.409
No, no.

751
00:50:02.442 --> 00:50:04.111
I have a child.

752
00:50:04.178 --> 00:50:06.613
(soft music)

753
00:50:10.750 --> 00:50:12.686
Because if I get wind

754
00:50:12.786 --> 00:50:14.821
that any of that crap
is going on in that house,


755
00:50:14.922 --> 00:50:16.790
I'm going to call the police,

756
00:50:16.858 --> 00:50:18.960
and you can be sure
of the fact


757
00:50:18.993 --> 00:50:21.128
they'll take your
child away from you.


758
00:50:21.162 --> 00:50:23.763

00:50:40.647 --> 00:50:41.615
Oh, we're going to hang them.

763
00:50:41.648 --> 00:50:43.683
I'm going to hang from here,

764
00:50:43.783 --> 00:50:46.287
and then along there.

765
00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:47.587

Don't worry, I'm

788
00:52:24.919 --> 00:52:27.254
You know, I bet some
of them even got lost.


789
00:52:27.288 --> 00:52:30.490
And people love to
come late to parties.


790
00:52:30.590 --> 00:52:31.658
You'll see.

791
00:52:34.328 --> 00:52:36.130
Maybe I should give
a few of them a call.


792
00:52:36.230 --> 00:52:38.765
I think I have a class list
from the school in the kitchen.


793
00:52:38.798 --> 00:52:40.167
Be right back.

794
00:52:41.469 --> 00:52:44.238
(gentle music)

795
00:53:07.161 --> 00:53:08.996
I don't think they're
coming, buddy.


796
00:53:10.431 --> 00:53:12.299
I know.

797
00:53:12.366 --> 00:53:15.469
I don't want you to
take it personally, okay?


798
00:53:15.503 --> 00:53:17.271
We live really far out of town.

799
00:53:17.304 --> 00:53:19.140
You know, some
people, they just,


800
00:53:19.206 --> 00:53:23.676
they can't spend the
time driving out here.


801
00:53:24.378 --> 00:53:26.313
Okay?

802
00:53:26.380 --> 00:53:28.648
But hey, next year
we'll have your party


803
00:53:28.681 --> 00:53:31.185
at the malt shop
or the pizza parlor.


804
00:53:31.285 --> 00:53:33.387
That'll be fun.

805
00:53:33.487 --> 00:53:35.322
Okay.

806
00:53:35.356 --> 00:53:38.859
Do you wanna
open your presents?


807
00:53:38.959 --> 00:53:40.361
Not right now.

808
00:53:40.461 --> 00:53:42.629
I think I'm just
going to go upstairs.


809
00:53:42.662 --> 00:53:44.298
You sure?

810
00:53:44.331 --> 00:53:46.333
Okay.

811
00:53:52.406 --> 00:53:55.742
(phone ringing)

812
00:54:00.081 --> 00:54:01.515
Stop calling here, Scott.

813
00:54:01.581 --> 00:54:03.517
[Scott] Please don't
hang up on me, Laura.


814
00:54:03.583 --> 00:54:06.320
Please talk to me.

815
00:54:07.354 --> 00:54:09.689
I've said everything I
ever want to say to you.


816
00:54:09.756 --> 00:54:12.226
[Scott] I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.


817
00:54:12.326 --> 00:54:14.661
I miss you.
I miss my son.


818
00:54:14.694 --> 00:54:16.097
Well, you better
get used to it


819
00:54:16.197 --> 00:54:18.432
because you'll never see
either one of us ever again.


820
00:54:18.532 --> 00:54:21.368
(tense music)

821
00:54:31.045 --> 00:54:33.914
(gentle music)

822
00:54:57.905 --> 00:55:01.075
And I love the way our
Hotpoint's designed too.


823
00:55:01.142 --> 00:55:02.977
It could have been made for me.

824
00:55:03.911 --> 00:55:07.214
The interior arrangements
are all so practical.


825
00:55:57.998 --> 00:56:00.601
(eerie music)

826
00:56:10.544 --> 00:56:12.279
Cody!

827
00:56:12.313 --> 00:56:13.214
Why?

828
00:56:13.314 --> 00:56:14.781
Why didn't
you hand these out?


829
00:56:14.814 --> 00:56:16.317
I spent all that time

830
00:56:16.350 --> 00:56:18.852
making a special day
for your birthday


831
00:56:18.953 --> 00:56:20.621
and you just sat there.

832
00:56:20.654 --> 00:56:23.290
You just sat there
and watched me do it.


833
00:56:23.324 --> 00:56:25.659
And you didn't even hand
out the invitations!


834
00:56:25.725 --> 00:56:26.994
Why?

835
00:56:27.027 --> 00:56:27.962
Why would you do that?

836
00:56:27.995 --> 00:56:29.496
Cody.

837
00:56:29.563 --> 00:56:30.898
Cody, no.

838
00:56:30.998 --> 00:56:32.666
Cody, come back here.

839
00:56:35.469 --> 00:56:36.470
Cody,

840
00:56:36.503 --> 00:56:38.138
Cody,

841
00:56:38.172 --> 00:56:39.540
Cody, stop it right now.

842
00:56:39.640 --> 00:56:41.842
- Now, tell me!
- Because they wouldn't come.


843
00:56:41.909 --> 00:56:43.911
You don't listen to me.
You don't listen to anyone!


844
00:56:44.011 --> 00:56:45.179
How would you know that?

845
00:56:45.246 --> 00:56:46.180
You didn't even
give them a chance.


846
00:56:46.213 --> 00:56:47.014
Because I'm not like them.

847
00:56:47.047 --> 00:56:47.982
I hate it here.

848
00:56:48.015 --> 00:56:49.483
I want to go home.

849
00:56:49.516 --> 00:56:51.518
We are not going back there.
Do you hear me?


850
00:56:51.585 --> 00:56:54.388
(eerie music)

851
00:56:54.488 --> 00:56:57.057
Cody.

852
00:57:00.361 --> 00:57:01.528
Cody, what--

853
00:57:01.562 --> 00:57:02.896
what is wrong with you?

854
00:57:02.997 --> 00:57:03.931
Cody, Cody,

855
00:57:04.031 --> 00:57:04.932
please.

856
00:57:05.032 --> 00:57:06.367
I'm so sorry.

857
00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:07.935
Okay.

858
00:57:08.035 --> 00:57:10.437
Breathe with Mommy.
Breathe, baby.


859
00:57:30.391 --> 00:57:32.092
If you start to feel bad again,

860
00:57:32.192 --> 00:57:34.261
you just tell the teacher, okay?

861
00:57:34.361 --> 00:57:36.096
Okay.

862
00:57:54.081 --> 00:57:55.549
[Boss] Laura.

863
00:57:58.052 --> 00:57:59.453
Laura.

864
00:58:02.623 --> 00:58:04.425
Laura!

865
00:58:04.458 --> 00:58:07.261
I need that new DM 40
on my desk in an hour.


866
00:58:09.430 --> 00:58:12.766
The DM4's the most
crucial form in the file.


867
00:58:12.833 --> 00:58:15.102
Hey, Cody, how was your day?

868
00:58:15.169 --> 00:58:17.771
- It was okay.
- Yeah?


869
00:58:21.942 --> 00:58:25.579
Cody, have you been
teasing those little girls?


870
00:58:27.815 --> 00:58:28.916
No.

871
00:58:28.949 --> 00:58:30.351
Are you sure?

872
00:58:30.451 --> 00:58:31.785
Yes.

873
00:58:31.819 --> 00:58:34.755
'Cause I can see them
tattling on you to a teacher.


874
00:58:37.624 --> 00:58:39.126
Do you want to give me
your side of the story


875
00:58:39.159 --> 00:58:40.794
before I get a call tonight?

876
00:58:40.828 --> 00:58:42.629
I didn't do anything.

877
00:58:43.263 --> 00:58:45.299
All right,
I'll wait for the call.


878
00:58:47.701 --> 00:58:50.371
(gentle music)

879
00:59:07.688 --> 00:59:10.491
(wood creaking)

880
00:59:24.972 --> 00:59:26.640
Mrs. Langtree?

881
00:59:27.908 --> 00:59:30.077
Oh, oh, hello.

882
00:59:30.177 --> 00:59:32.980
I was just checking
on the appliances.


883
00:59:33.013 --> 00:59:34.748
- Really?
- [Mrs. Langtree] Yeah.


884
00:59:34.849 --> 00:59:37.518
I don't think so.
I think you were snooping.


885
00:59:37.551 --> 00:59:40.087
Did you find the drugs
you were looking for?


886
00:59:40.187 --> 00:59:41.555
You know, this is my house

887
00:59:41.622 --> 00:59:43.223
so I can actually check
on it anytime I want.


888
00:59:43.323 --> 00:59:44.558
Not without my
permission, you can't.


889
00:59:44.658 --> 00:59:46.326
And if you'd like
to validate that,


890
00:59:46.360 --> 00:59:47.995
we can call the police.

891
00:59:48.028 --> 00:59:49.596
The police?

892
00:59:49.696 --> 00:59:51.365
Mm-hmm.

893
00:59:52.032 --> 00:59:54.836
Is there something
wrong with you?


894
00:59:54.869 --> 00:59:57.872
Because I think there's
something terribly wrong


895
00:59:57.938 --> 00:59:59.273
going on in this house.

896
00:59:59.373 --> 01:00:00.340
Well, when you figure it out,

897
01:00:00.374 --> 01:00:02.009
will you give me a holler?

898
01:00:02.042 --> 01:00:04.278
Because I would
just love to know.


899
01:00:04.378 --> 01:00:07.882
I want you out of this house.

900
01:00:07.916 --> 01:00:10.050
You have 30 days.

901
01:00:10.117 --> 01:00:11.718
Put it in writing.

902
01:00:11.752 --> 01:00:12.953
Oh, I will.

903
01:00:13.053 --> 01:00:14.923
30 days.

[Cody] Hello.

935
01:02:19.179 --> 01:02:21.015
Where are you?

936
01:02:21.049 --> 01:02:22.349
I'm ready.

937
01:02:22.416 --> 01:02:25.686
(ethereal music)

938
01:02:31.025 --> 01:02:32.426
Cody?

939
01:02:33.827 --> 01:02:34.996
Cody?

940
01:02:36.363 --> 01:02:38.032
Cody, stop!

941
01:02:41.201 --> 01:02:44.371
(eerie whispering)

942
01:03:30.217 --> 01:03:33.754
(coughing)

943
01:03:33.820 --> 01:03:35.756
Cody, Cody.

944
01:03:35.822 --> 01:03:36.991
Please breathe.

945
01:03:37.091 --> 01:03:38.325
Breathe, baby.

946
01:03:38.425 --> 01:03:41.129
There. That's right, baby.
That's right.


947
01:03:41.228 --> 01:03:42.429
You're okay.

948
01:03:42.462 --> 01:03:45.432
Oh, Cody. Cody.

949
01:03:45.499 --> 01:03:48.268
(breathing heavily)

950
01:03:48.335 --> 01:03:51.072
- (gentle music)
- Cody.


951
01:04:26.140 --> 01:04:27.875
[Boss] I've had
repeated complaints


952
01:04:27.975 --> 01:04:30.978
about the DM 40 being filed
incorrectly or incomplete,


953
01:04:31.012 --> 01:04:33.014
not attaching your
correspondence


954
01:04:33.114 --> 01:04:34.314
to the proper files.

955
01:04:34.381 --> 01:04:36.383
I'll try to get
better at that.


956
01:04:36.483 --> 01:04:39.486
It's extremely important
that you maintain


957
01:04:39.519 --> 01:04:42.422
proper maintenance of the
files for the auditors.


958
01:04:42.522 --> 01:04:44.324
We're graded on accuracy.

959
01:04:44.391 --> 01:04:46.393
There're fines implemented

960
01:04:46.493 --> 01:04:48.863
if we don't meet
a certain standard.


961
01:04:48.963 --> 01:04:52.033
I understand.

962
01:04:52.133 --> 01:04:55.002
Laura, I have to ask you
a personal question.


963
01:04:56.369 --> 01:04:57.972
Have you been drinking?

964
01:04:58.005 --> 01:04:59.173
(scoffs)

965
01:04:59.239 --> 01:05:02.910
I know you have.
I can smell it.


966
01:05:03.010 --> 01:05:05.012
We don't tolerate
drinking on the job.


967
01:05:05.046 --> 01:05:07.380
That's clearly stated
in your employee handbook.


968
01:05:07.481 --> 01:05:09.016
Yes, it is.

969
01:05:09.083 --> 01:05:10.885
I know because I read it.

970
01:05:13.988 --> 01:05:16.556
But I think that if you had
my job, you'd be drinking too.


971
01:05:16.656 --> 01:05:19.526
You try leaving your
family and your friends


972
01:05:19.559 --> 01:05:21.028
and everything you've ever known

973
01:05:21.062 --> 01:05:23.931
to move to this small town
in the middle of nowhere,


974
01:05:24.031 --> 01:05:25.199
all by yourself,

975
01:05:25.265 --> 01:05:28.535
simply because no one
gave you any other choice.


976
01:05:28.568 --> 01:05:30.537
Then talk to me about
drinking on the job.


977
01:05:30.570 --> 01:05:31.571
Laura, look.

978
01:05:31.671 --> 01:05:33.007
Or maybe there's
a company manual


979
01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:36.043
on how to get rid
of a monster.


980
01:05:36.077 --> 01:05:38.712
And I'm not talking
about my ex-husband


981
01:05:38.745 --> 01:05:43.117
or my entire
overwhelming situation.


982
01:05:43.217 --> 01:05:47.221
No, I am talking about
an actual monster


983
01:05:47.255 --> 01:05:48.755
who comes into my house

984
01:05:48.789 --> 01:05:50.191
in the middle of the night

985
01:05:50.224 --> 01:05:51.591
and tries to drag my son out

986
01:05:51.691 --> 01:05:53.928
and drown him in
a pond out back.


987
01:05:56.797 --> 01:05:58.900
I know you think I'm nuts.

988
01:05:58.933 --> 01:06:00.433
No.

989
01:06:00.534 --> 01:06:01.568
I don't think that.

990
01:06:01.635 --> 01:06:03.271
I think you need help.

991
01:06:03.370 --> 01:06:04.604
I do not need help.

992
01:06:04.704 --> 01:06:06.974
I have everything
completely under control.


993
01:06:07.074 --> 01:06:08.708
No, you don't.

994
01:06:08.742 --> 01:06:11.745
There's no reason we
can't help women like you.


995
01:06:11.778 --> 01:06:12.980
There's a number there.

996
01:06:13.080 --> 01:06:17.051
Call it, speak to
a nurse or counselor.


997
01:06:17.084 --> 01:06:22.522
Actually, I think
you should keep this


998
01:06:22.622 --> 01:06:23.723
because I don't
want your help


999
01:06:23.757 --> 01:06:26.093
and I don't want
your miserable job.


1000
01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:27.561
Then go.

1001
01:06:27.594 --> 01:06:29.063
I'm gone, daddy-o.

Ginger Rogers.

1016
01:07:12.340 --> 01:07:15.309
Your beer is empty.

1017
01:07:15.343 --> 01:07:16.643
I'm going to buy you another.

1018
01:07:16.676 --> 01:07:18.145
Bartender, can he have another?

1019
01:07:18.179 --> 01:07:20.147
And can I have
another one of those?


1020
01:07:20.181 --> 01:07:20.948
No, no, no, please.

1021
01:07:20.982 --> 01:07:22.449
You, you don't buy me a drink.

1022
01:07:22.482 --> 01:07:23.985
Come on, I'm celebrating.

1023
01:07:24.018 --> 01:07:25.485
Oh, what are we celebrating?

1024
01:07:25.518 --> 01:07:27.321
I quit my job today.

1025
01:07:27.355 --> 01:07:29.156
I hated it so I quit it.

1026
01:07:29.223 --> 01:07:30.690
Atta girl.

1027
01:07:30.790 --> 01:07:32.126
I like your style.

1028
01:07:32.159 --> 01:07:35.528
I'll tell you what,
I'll get you that drink


1029
01:07:35.629 --> 01:07:38.465
if you come dance with me.

1030
01:07:38.498 --> 01:07:40.167
Oh.

1031
01:07:40.234 --> 01:07:41.168
Come on.

1032
01:07:41.235 --> 01:07:43.004
One dance.

1033
01:07:46.473 --> 01:07:47.807
(gentle music)

1034
01:07:47.842 --> 01:07:49.210
You know this song?

1035
01:07:49.310 --> 01:07:50.510
Mm-mm.

1036
01:07:50.543 --> 01:07:53.580
Yeah, well,
it's old and forgotten.


1037
01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:56.150
Kinda like me.

1038
01:07:56.183 --> 01:07:57.584
But, you,

1039
01:07:57.684 --> 01:08:01.155
you are a pretty young thing

1040
01:08:01.188 --> 01:08:04.892
in a pretty little
polka dot dress.


1041
01:08:07.694 --> 01:08:09.330
You look like an angel.

1042
01:08:10.664 --> 01:08:13.034
I mean like...

1043
01:08:13.067 --> 01:08:16.203
like I died and went to heaven.

1044
01:08:18.906 --> 01:08:20.207
I was an angel once

1045
01:08:20.241 --> 01:08:22.742
in a play at church.

1046
01:08:23.911 --> 01:08:27.882
My grandmother made me the
most beautiful angel wings.


1047
01:08:27.949 --> 01:08:31.085
I felt like I could
fly in those wings.


1048
01:08:31.185 --> 01:08:32.353
A girl like you,

1049
01:08:32.386 --> 01:08:35.056
you don't need wings to fly.

1050
01:08:35.089 --> 01:08:36.723
No, I have a car.

1051
01:08:36.790 --> 01:08:39.226
Oh, well, that'll do.

1052
01:08:39.293 --> 01:08:40.294
That's pretty good.

1053
01:08:41.062 --> 01:08:43.297
So what are you going
to do next, angel?


1054
01:08:43.397 --> 01:08:45.933
(soft music)

1055
01:08:47.234 --> 01:08:50.104
I don't know.

1056
01:08:50.204 --> 01:08:51.305
I don't know.

1057
01:08:53.207 --> 01:08:53.975
Hey, hey, hey.

1058
01:08:54.075 --> 01:08:54.641
Don't cry.

1059
01:08:54.741 --> 01:08:55.943
Don't cry.

1060
01:08:56.043 --> 01:08:57.244
You're going to
figure something out.


1061
01:08:59.746 --> 01:09:02.249
I just wish I could
go somewhere else,


1062
01:09:02.316 --> 01:09:04.318
you know, somewhere new

1063
01:09:04.418 --> 01:09:05.785
and start fresh.

1064
01:09:05.886 --> 01:09:07.821
Just, just start over.

1065
01:09:09.123 --> 01:09:11.425
Then you go,

1066
01:09:11.459 --> 01:09:15.595
you dig out those pretty
little wings of yours


1067
01:09:15.662 --> 01:09:19.266
and you fly, fly, fly.

1068
01:09:19.300 --> 01:09:21.836
(soft music)

1069
01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:42.689
(tense music)

1070
01:09:49.629 --> 01:09:50.831
Cody.

1071
01:09:52.333 --> 01:09:53.334
Do you know Cody Butler?

1072
01:09:53.434 --> 01:09:54.468
Have you seen Cody Butler?

1073
01:09:54.534 --> 01:09:55.503
No.

1074
01:09:55.602 --> 01:09:57.204
(tense music)

1075
01:09:57.304 --> 01:09:58.671
Cody?

1076
01:10:00.975 --> 01:10:02.609
Do you know Cody Butler?

1077
01:10:02.642 --> 01:10:05.479
Hey, do you know Cody Butler?

1078
01:10:05.545 --> 01:10:07.982
Cody?

1079
01:10:08.015 --> 01:10:11.052
Hey, hey, do you
know Cody Butler?


1080
01:10:11.152 --> 01:10:12.819
No?

1081
01:10:12.887 --> 01:10:15.688
(tense music)

1082
01:10:16.723 --> 01:10:18.658
Have you seen Cody Butler?

1083
01:10:18.691 --> 01:10:20.727
(eerie music)

1084
01:10:20.827 --> 01:10:24.899
(child screams)

1085
01:10:24.999 --> 01:10:26.067
[Officer] How are
you today, ma'am?


1086
01:10:26.167 --> 01:10:28.869
Officer, I came
to pick up my son


1087
01:10:28.969 --> 01:10:30.371
and I can't find him anywhere.

1088
01:10:30.471 --> 01:10:32.006
Okay, okay.
It's all right, ma'am.


1089
01:10:32.039 --> 01:10:33.340
What's your son's name?

1090
01:10:33.407 --> 01:10:34.674
His name is Cody Butler.

1091
01:10:34.741 --> 01:10:36.977
He's a second grade student.

1092
01:10:37.011 --> 01:10:38.846
I'm afraid that my ex-husband

1093
01:10:38.913 --> 01:10:41.015
has taken him
without my knowledge.


1094
01:10:41.048 --> 01:10:42.316
[Officer] Okay, well,
we're going to get


1095
01:10:42.349 --> 01:10:44.218
- to the bottom of this, okay?
- Okay.


1096
01:10:44.318 --> 01:10:45.819
[Officer] Do you, do you
have any identification?


1097
01:10:45.853 --> 01:10:47.154
For Cody?

1098
01:10:47.188 --> 01:10:48.721
[Officer] No, ma'am,
your identification.


1099
01:10:48.822 --> 01:10:51.358
(soft music)

1100
01:10:54.528 --> 01:10:55.695
Hi, Laura.

1101
01:10:55.728 --> 01:10:57.064
I'm Barb Schiff.

1102
01:10:57.164 --> 01:10:58.933
I'm a caseworker
with the department.


1103
01:10:59.033 --> 01:11:00.868
I'm sorry it took me
so long to get here.


1104
01:11:00.935 --> 01:11:03.370
How are you?

1105
01:11:03.404 --> 01:11:04.872
Where is Cody?

1106
01:11:04.939 --> 01:11:06.941
I went to school to pick
him up and he was not there.


1107
01:11:07.041 --> 01:11:08.509
No, he wasn't.

1108
01:11:08.542 --> 01:11:11.744
Where do you think he is?

1109
01:11:11.846 --> 01:11:12.947
Does his dad have him?

1110
01:11:13.047 --> 01:11:15.216
[Barb] No, he doesn't.

1111
01:11:15.249 --> 01:11:16.716
How do you know?

1112
01:11:16.749 --> 01:11:18.285
Did you call him?

1113
01:11:18.385 --> 01:11:20.687
I didn't need to.

1114
01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:23.557
What do you mean?

1115
01:11:23.623 --> 01:11:26.060
Laura,

1116
01:11:26.093 --> 01:11:29.130
would you mind if we
backed up a little bit?


1117
01:11:29.230 --> 01:11:31.232
I think I could be of more help

1118
01:11:31.298 --> 01:11:34.602
if I understood the
details of Cody's accident.


1119
01:11:34.701 --> 01:11:39.306
I'm referring to the accident
last year in Arizona.


1120
01:11:41.575 --> 01:11:42.910
Oh.

1121
01:11:43.944 --> 01:11:45.479
Well, that was nothing.

1122
01:11:45.579 --> 01:11:47.481
He fell in the pool.

1123
01:11:51.385 --> 01:11:52.785
I wasn't there.

1124
01:11:52.887 --> 01:11:56.023
I had to go to
the grocery store.


1125
01:11:56.123 --> 01:11:59.160
His father was watching him.

1126
01:12:02.329 --> 01:12:05.266
When I came home, Scott was on
the couch, watching the game


1127
01:12:05.299 --> 01:12:07.101
and I went into the kitchen

1128
01:12:07.134 --> 01:12:11.505
and I had this weird feeling
like something wrong.


1129
01:12:11.605 --> 01:12:12.940
And I was standing at the sink

1130
01:12:13.007 --> 01:12:14.674
and I was looking out
the window at the pool


1131
01:12:14.774 --> 01:12:16.844
and I thought I saw
something in it.


1132
01:12:17.511 --> 01:12:21.282
When I went out to check,
I saw that it was him.


1133
01:12:22.082 --> 01:12:26.020
And then what happened?

1134
01:12:27.121 --> 01:12:29.523
Well, I dragged him out

1135
01:12:29.623 --> 01:12:30.823
and I performed CPR on him

1136
01:12:30.925 --> 01:12:32.626
until the paramedics came

1137
01:12:32.692 --> 01:12:37.298
and then they revived him
and he was completely okay.


1138
01:12:40.301 --> 01:12:41.869
Why?

1139
01:12:42.702 --> 01:12:45.039
Are you saying there's
something wrong with him


1140
01:12:45.139 --> 01:12:46.773
because of what happened?

1141
01:12:46.806 --> 01:12:48.708
No, that is not
what I'm saying.


1142
01:12:48.808 --> 01:12:51.879
(phone vibrating)

1143
01:13:07.061 --> 01:13:09.063
It's okay, Laura.

1144
01:13:09.163 --> 01:13:11.131
You're all right.

1145
01:13:11.999 --> 01:13:14.902
(eerie music)

1146
01:13:20.174 --> 01:13:22.676
I think I need some water.

1147
01:13:24.245 --> 01:13:25.546
Okay.

1148
01:13:25.646 --> 01:13:26.580
You sit tight.

1149

Cody! Cody.

1168
01:16:50.083 --> 01:16:51.785
What happened?

1169
01:16:51.886 --> 01:16:53.387
Where have you been?

1170
01:16:53.420 --> 01:16:55.122
Honey, why didn't
you wait for me


1171
01:16:55.222 --> 01:16:56.623
to pick you up from school?

1172
01:16:56.723 --> 01:16:59.626
[Cody] It's time
for me to go home, Mom.


1173
01:16:59.726 --> 01:17:01.228
No, no, no.

1174
01:17:01.295 --> 01:17:03.363
I'm going to take you
somewhere else, okay?


1175
01:17:03.397 --> 01:17:04.531
I'm going to take
you away from here.


1176
01:17:04.565 --> 01:17:06.233
That's what you want, right?

1177
01:17:06.300 --> 01:17:08.135
We're going to pack up
the car


1178
01:17:08.235 --> 01:17:09.904
and we're going to go
somewhere brand new


1179
01:17:09.938 --> 01:17:12.439
and we're going to have
a fresh start, okay?


1180
01:17:12.539 --> 01:17:14.041
Okay?

1181
01:17:14.074 --> 01:17:16.977
[Cody] I don't want to.

1182
01:17:17.077 --> 01:17:20.280
Well, you have to.
Mommy says.


1183
01:17:20.380 --> 01:17:24.785
So go upstairs
and pack up your stuff.

1185

Cody, where are you going?

1186
01:17:32.326 --> 01:17:33.928

Cody, please don't leave me.

1202
01:19:21.201 --> 01:19:25.772
I want to go with
the pretty lady.


1203
01:19:25.873 --> 01:19:27.240
No, no.

1204
01:19:27.341 --> 01:19:28.742
Don't say that.

1205
01:19:28.843 --> 01:19:30.044
Don't say that.

1206
01:19:30.110 --> 01:19:34.681
You want to stay here with me.

1207
01:19:34.715 --> 01:19:38.019
You have to let me go, Mom.

1208
01:19:38.052 --> 01:19:40.021
Why?

1209
01:19:43.091 --> 01:19:46.226
It wasn't your fault, Mom.

1210
01:19:46.259 --> 01:19:48.963
(sobbing)

1211
01:19:49.063 --> 01:19:50.064
It wasn't on purpose.

1212
01:19:50.130 --> 01:19:51.231
It was an accident.

1213
01:19:51.298 --> 01:19:52.366
It's okay.

1214
01:19:52.399 --> 01:19:53.467
It's not okay.

1215
01:19:53.567 --> 01:19:55.870
It will be, you'll see.

1216
01:19:55.903 --> 01:20:00.641
Please, Cody, I don't
want you to leave me.


1217
01:20:00.741 --> 01:20:03.377
You have to let me go, Mom.

1218
01:20:03.410 --> 01:20:06.213
Please. Please.

[Jim] The pipe burst.

1223
01:23:07.561 --> 01:23:09.964
She broke it, Jim.

1224
01:23:10.064 --> 01:23:11.265
What's that?

1225

Jim, Jim.
