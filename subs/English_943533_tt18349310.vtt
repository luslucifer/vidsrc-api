Alyssa, you've been

some awfully vanilla dreams.

I'm just a little off-schedule.

We've got that launch party
tonight.

We're going to need your charm
meter set to a solid 9.8.

Hmm. That's tonight?

I was hoping that I could
conk out on the couch

Jack?

Will you get back, please?

57
00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.511
Jack, do you have any comment
about your brother?


58
00:04:06.738 --> 00:04:09.163
- What has he said to you?
- Jack, could you just turn...


59
00:04:09.182 --> 00:04:10.998
Any plans on settling down soon?

60
00:04:11.092 --> 00:04:12.166
Is there someone special
in your life?


61
00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.410
It's nice to see you all,
but I can't talk.


62
00:04:14.503 --> 00:04:16.746
- Duty calls.
- What's going on?


63
00:04:16.764 --> 00:04:18.856
I did say we should have taken
the service entrance.


64
00:04:19.008 --> 00:04:20.674
And miss the photo-op? No.

65
00:04:20.694 --> 00:04:22.360
We mustn't disappoint
the public, Taffer.


66
00:04:22.511 --> 00:04:24.420
Rule number one
when visiting abroad.


67
00:04:24.513 --> 00:04:27.256
Every move must be chronicled
and whispered of.


68
00:04:27.275 --> 00:04:29.850
This is a treasure hunt,
and we are the treasure.


69
00:04:29.944 --> 00:04:31.610
They're like a pack of bloody
hyenas, clamoring for the kill.


70
00:04:31.763 --> 00:04:34.447
Good. The louder they bark,
the more positive my press.


71
00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:35.765
What's next on the gauntlet?

72
00:04:35.858 --> 00:04:37.858
Lunch with the vice-mayor
and city dignitaries.


73
00:04:37.952 --> 00:04:40.770
- The vice-mayor?
- Mm-hmm.


74
00:04:40.788 --> 00:04:43.105
You have a phone interview
with Radio France at 4:00.


75
00:04:43.124 --> 00:04:45.107
We can do that from the room
if you like.


76
00:04:45.126 --> 00:04:48.277
Then a gala event this evening
at the Vanguard Hotel.


77
00:04:48.296 --> 00:04:50.296
Keep the interview
and skip the gala.

79
00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:54.116
It's a launch event for a brand
you've endorsed, sir.


80
00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:55.134
You're the face, if you will.

81
00:04:55.286 --> 00:04:57.303
And?

82
00:04:57.455 --> 00:04:58.955
They're partnering with
one of your top charities


83
00:04:59.048 --> 00:05:01.149
and making
a hefty public donation.


84
00:05:02.961 --> 00:05:04.718
Well, please ensure that
my tux is pressed.


85
00:05:04.738 --> 00:05:06.738
Already taken care of.

86
00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:07.888
Who knows, Taffer?

87
00:05:07.907 --> 00:05:09.648
Might not be
a complete waste of time.


88
00:05:09.743 --> 00:05:12.134
I might just meet someone new.

89
00:05:12.153 --> 00:05:13.327
Ah.

90
00:05:23.815 --> 00:05:25.506

I'm late, I know. I apologize.

93
00:05:36.102 --> 00:05:37.268
Let's just move past it.

94
00:05:37.495 --> 00:05:38.436
Rachel, I've been waiting here
for 20 minutes.


95
00:05:38.663 --> 00:05:41.397
What did I just say?

96
00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.779
- Don't you look nice?
- Oh, you look nice, too.


97
00:05:51.951 --> 00:05:53.526
Tell me it wasn't us
who came up with that slogan.


98
00:05:53.678 --> 00:05:55.787
I heard it was that guy
from GRE.


99
00:05:55.938 --> 00:05:58.438
Tonight we're strictly
public relations.


100
00:05:58.458 --> 00:06:00.792
Someone needs to get that guy
a thesaurus.


101
00:06:01.019 --> 00:06:01.867
I know.

102
00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:05.037
Oh, hey.
The slogan looks fabulous.


103

Uh, brown-noser.

105
00:06:07.467 --> 00:06:09.358
Part of the job is...

106
00:06:09.377 --> 00:06:10.617
knowing when to fib.

107
00:06:10.711 --> 00:06:12.303
- I know.
- You're getting it.


108
00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:14.880
Especially when you're hunting
for a promotion.

Alyssa:
Wait. Isn't that...


111
00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.480
Prince Jack, Earl of Northshire,
sixth in line to the throne.


112
00:06:22.707 --> 00:06:24.649
But first in line
to my royal-watching heart.


113
00:06:24.876 --> 00:06:28.227
He is even glossier
than his magazine covers.


114
00:06:28.321 --> 00:06:30.137
Rachel: Forget touch-ups.
They've been toning him down.


115
00:06:30.231 --> 00:06:31.489
Didn't think he'd show tonight.

116
00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:32.907
He never shows up
to these things.


117
00:06:34.385 --> 00:06:35.551
Wish me luck. I'm going in.

I'm so sorry about that.

I don't know if she thought
she was doing me a favor


133
00:07:26.287 --> 00:07:27.269
or playing a prank on me.

134

No, please.
No apology necessary.

I wish I had a friend around
who would speak so highly of me.

Your reputation precedes you.

137
00:07:35.463 --> 00:07:36.387
What did she say?

138
00:07:36.614 --> 00:07:38.890
Only the right things,
I assure you.


139
00:07:39.117 --> 00:07:40.558
Now, Alyssa.

140
00:07:40.709 --> 00:07:42.560
I believe
that's of Celtic origin?


141
00:07:42.787 --> 00:07:44.711
Really? I thought it's from
Who's the Boss.


142
00:07:44.731 --> 00:07:45.971
No. Actually,

143
00:07:46.065 --> 00:07:49.233
if my fading memories of Oxford
don't deceive me,


144
00:07:49.385 --> 00:07:53.295
"Alyssa" means "noble woman"
in the Gaelic tongue.


145
00:07:53.314 --> 00:07:57.533
Wow. And what does "Jack" mean
in the Gaelic tongue?


146
00:07:59.078 --> 00:08:00.894
Now, that's a very good question

147
00:08:00.988 --> 00:08:02.229
that deserves
a fascinating answer.


148
00:08:02.323 --> 00:08:05.232
But first, can I get you
a drink?


149
00:08:05.251 --> 00:08:07.585
Yes. I'd love a drink.

150
00:08:07.736 --> 00:08:10.904
Now unfortunately, all they have
is this designer vodka.


151
00:08:10.924 --> 00:08:12.089
I'd complain,

152
00:08:12.316 --> 00:08:13.499
but apparently they're making
a hefty donation


153
00:08:13.651 --> 00:08:14.759
to one of my charities, so...

154
00:08:14.986 --> 00:08:16.669
Personally, I thought
it was a tad inappropriate


155
00:08:16.821 --> 00:08:18.245
to send alcohol to a school

156
00:08:18.339 --> 00:08:20.172
filled with
underprivileged children,


157
00:08:20.266 --> 00:08:22.675
but no one really listens to me.

158
00:08:22.769 --> 00:08:24.435
I'm just the figurehead.

159
00:08:24.662 --> 00:08:26.829
My brother Timothy,
he's the business one.


160
00:08:26.847 --> 00:08:28.940
I guess that makes me
the rapscallion.


161
00:08:31.018 --> 00:08:32.501
- Vodka is fine.
- Perfect.


162
00:08:32.594 --> 00:08:33.852

163
00:08:33.947 --> 00:08:35.613
We'll take another martini,
my friend. Thank you.


164
00:08:37.766 --> 00:08:38.783
Thank you so much.

165
00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:40.025
- Cheers.
- Cheers.


166
00:08:40.119 --> 00:08:41.202
(glasses clinking)

167
00:08:43.181 --> 00:08:44.863
- So, Alyssa...
- Mm-hmm?


168
00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:46.031
what brings you here tonight?

169
00:08:46.184 --> 00:08:47.792
Well, Jack,

170
00:08:48.019 --> 00:08:51.520
my very annoying, pushy
but well-meaning friend Rachel,


171
00:08:51.539 --> 00:08:54.039
who you just met
before abandoning me.


172
00:08:54.133 --> 00:08:55.524
She forced me to come.

173
00:08:55.543 --> 00:09:00.362
But I'm also a publicist,
here to represent my firm.


174
00:09:00.381 --> 00:09:02.622
Hijacked by high society.

175
00:09:02.642 --> 00:09:04.883
I see we have that in common.

176
00:09:04.978 --> 00:09:06.143
I suppose we do, yes.

177
00:09:08.372 --> 00:09:10.889
I'll tell you what.

178
00:09:11.042 --> 00:09:14.735
Want to vent a little about it
away from all of this hoopla?


179
00:09:17.565 --> 00:09:20.382
Mm-hmm. Yeah. I'd like that.

180
00:09:20.401 --> 00:09:22.785
Then follow me.

181
00:09:24.572 --> 00:09:26.980
Rachel:
Alyssa?


182
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.250
You two, together? Hot babies.

183
00:09:34.507 --> 00:09:35.655
Jack:
So, Alyssa,


184
00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:38.250
tell me more about yourself.

185
00:09:38.344 --> 00:09:41.495
Well, like I mentioned before,
I'm a publicist by trade,


186
00:09:41.514 --> 00:09:43.848
working my way to
a corner office,


187
00:09:44.075 --> 00:09:46.333
and I've spent most of my life
in the city.


188
00:09:46.427 --> 00:09:49.020
Yes. Miraculously unattached,
somehow.


189
00:09:51.098 --> 00:09:55.842
Yeah. I just got out of
a serious long relationship.


190
00:09:55.936 --> 00:09:59.513
My sympathies. 
What went wrong,

191
00:09:59.607 --> 00:10:02.682
if you don't mind my asking?

192
00:10:02.777 --> 00:10:05.119
We just started drifting apart.

193
00:10:06.539 --> 00:10:08.764
And if I'm being honest,
one day I came home


194
00:10:08.783 --> 00:10:11.709
and he was in bed with
one of my clients,


195
00:10:11.936 --> 00:10:13.544
and that kind of put
the nail in the coffin.


196
00:10:13.771 --> 00:10:15.437
(sighing)

197
00:10:15.456 --> 00:10:18.107
Cheeky bastard.

198
00:10:18.125 --> 00:10:20.459
I'm not sure "cheeky"
is the word I would use exactly.


199
00:10:20.553 --> 00:10:23.537
No, but how short-sighted of him

200
00:10:23.556 --> 00:10:25.473
to risk losing someone like you.

201
00:10:27.134 --> 00:10:30.728
Well, I seem to have a habit

202
00:10:30.879 --> 00:10:33.138
of attracting risk-takers.

203
00:10:33.291 --> 00:10:36.792
True love is precious, and it
should never be gambled with.


204
00:10:36.811 --> 00:10:38.552
Sadly, it often takes
a broken heart or two


205
00:10:38.571 --> 00:10:39.570
to learn that lesson.

206
00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:44.316
Sounds like you've had
a few bad bets of your own.


207
00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:46.318
Yet here we both are,

208
00:10:46.412 --> 00:10:48.746
back at the table, willing
to try our luck once again.


209
00:10:50.917 --> 00:10:52.333
(glasses clinking)

210
00:10:57.090 --> 00:10:59.757
Right over there
is my favorite place to eat.


211
00:10:59.908 --> 00:11:01.425
I'll have to check it out.

212
00:11:01.577 --> 00:11:02.593
Your Highness?

213
00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:04.336
Time to go.

214
00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:08.340
Yes. I'm so sorry,

215
00:11:08.492 --> 00:11:11.602
but I have a prior engagement
that simply cannot be avoided.


216
00:11:12.997 --> 00:11:14.012
Can I see you again?

217
00:11:14.107 --> 00:11:16.849
Some place quieter,

218
00:11:17.001 --> 00:11:20.018
away from all the paparazzi
and people.


219
00:11:20.113 --> 00:11:23.172
Yeah. I would like that.

220
00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:24.840
Splendid.

221
00:11:24.933 --> 00:11:28.119
What's the best way
to reach you?


222
00:11:30.514 --> 00:11:32.123
(phone buttons beeping)

223
00:11:35.444 --> 00:11:37.202
My number.

224
00:11:37.355 --> 00:11:39.613
Nice to meet you, Alyssa.

225
00:11:39.707 --> 00:11:41.448
Nice to meet you, too, Jack.

226
00:11:41.467 --> 00:11:44.051
See you soon.

227
00:11:48.474 --> 00:11:50.432
(laughing)

228
00:11:55.039 --> 00:11:57.648
(sighing) I thought that night
would never end.


229
00:11:57.799 --> 00:11:59.799
I can't stand those galas.

230
00:11:59.894 --> 00:12:01.968
I'd rather spend a night
in the stocks.


231
00:12:01.988 --> 00:12:05.230
You seemed to be enjoying
yourself well enough, sir.


232
00:12:05.324 --> 00:12:08.159
(exhaling)

233
00:12:10.145 --> 00:12:12.812
She was an enchanting
little thing, wasn't she?


234
00:12:12.907 --> 00:12:14.072
I'll send you her info.

235
00:12:14.167 --> 00:12:16.000
Find out what you can.

236
00:12:16.227 --> 00:12:18.076
Yes, Your Highness.

237
00:12:18.229 --> 00:12:20.838
Ah.

238
00:12:22.675 --> 00:12:25.734
There you are.

239
00:12:25.753 --> 00:12:27.661
I am going to go wash
the taste of that cheap stuff


240
00:12:27.755 --> 00:12:30.163
that they were serving
out of my mouth.


241
00:12:30.257 --> 00:12:31.682
I'll see you in the morning.

242
00:12:34.245 --> 00:12:36.270
(sighing)

243
00:12:42.586 --> 00:12:44.528
Ah.

244
00:13:17.563 --> 00:13:19.980
(phone vibrating)

245
00:13:23.903 --> 00:13:25.310
What?

246
00:13:25.404 --> 00:13:27.571
I'm calling with your weekly
reminder, dear brother.


247
00:13:30.559 --> 00:13:32.892
Are you my nursemaid now,
Timothy?


248
00:13:32.987 --> 00:13:34.578
Will you sing me softly to bed?

249
00:13:34.805 --> 00:13:37.081
Have you taken them?

250
00:13:37.308 --> 00:13:39.733
Taking what?
You'll have to be more precise.


251
00:13:39.827 --> 00:13:42.327
Taking my time? Taking care?

252
00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:44.162
Taking a hard right turn?

253
00:13:44.257 --> 00:13:46.423
Your pills, Jack.

254
00:13:46.575 --> 00:13:49.051
Are you taking your pills?

255
00:13:50.838 --> 00:13:52.004
Of course I am.

256
00:13:52.156 --> 00:13:53.597
Promise me.

257
00:13:57.753 --> 00:14:01.755
(pills rattling in bottle)

258
00:14:01.774 --> 00:14:05.734
There you are. In like Flynn.
Consider me anesthetized.


259
00:14:08.263 --> 00:14:10.522
Thank you, Jack.

260
00:14:10.674 --> 00:14:13.117
You know I love you.

261
00:14:13.268 --> 00:14:16.436
Susan loves you.
Mother loves you.


262
00:14:16.455 --> 00:14:19.031
We all miss you.

263
00:14:19.125 --> 00:14:20.582
The feeling is mutual.

264
00:14:22.536 --> 00:14:24.420
(dial tone sounding)

265
00:14:35.975 --> 00:14:38.726
Of course I'm taking my pills!

266
00:15:15.181 --> 00:15:17.139
Bottoms up, beautiful.

267
00:15:19.518 --> 00:15:21.352
See you soon.

268
00:15:35.943 --> 00:15:37.368
(sighing)

269
00:15:59.450 --> 00:16:07.450
♪

270
00:16:13.814 --> 00:16:16.222
So, what are you planning
on wearing on your big date?


271
00:16:16.242 --> 00:16:20.226
I'm thinking saucy serving wench
meets posh princess.


272
00:16:20.246 --> 00:16:22.821
(chuckling)
I doubt he's even going to call.


273
00:16:22.973 --> 00:16:25.249
But I was thinking
lady-in-waiting.


274
00:16:25.476 --> 00:16:26.917
At best, a baroness.

275
00:16:27.144 --> 00:16:29.494
Mmm. Leaving room
for social climbing. I like it.


276
00:16:29.588 --> 00:16:32.071
Just remember, you might hail
from Connecticut,


277
00:16:32.166 --> 00:16:33.165
but you're still royalty to me.

278
00:16:33.317 --> 00:16:34.908
Oh.

279
00:16:34.927 --> 00:16:37.577
By the way,
obviously I'm rooting for you


280
00:16:37.671 --> 00:16:38.745
and want you to get married

281
00:16:38.764 --> 00:16:39.746
and have
many blue-blooded babies,


282
00:16:39.765 --> 00:16:43.267
but if the moment presents
itself


283
00:16:43.418 --> 00:16:45.661
and it doesn't feel weird,

284
00:16:45.754 --> 00:16:47.829
maybe you could talk up KLC
a bit.


285
00:16:47.923 --> 00:16:50.423
Imagine if we got him
to switch reps.


286
00:16:50.443 --> 00:16:53.669
The two of us
would be running this place.


287
00:16:53.687 --> 00:16:55.837
Nothing obvious.
Nothing obvious.


288
00:16:55.856 --> 00:16:57.522
Just, you know, something
to keep on the back burner.


289
00:16:57.616 --> 00:17:00.451
(phone vibrating)

290
00:17:00.602 --> 00:17:02.453
- Is that him?
- I don't know.


291
00:17:05.124 --> 00:17:06.698
Hello?

292
00:17:06.850 --> 00:17:08.625
Jack:
Hey there.


293
00:17:08.852 --> 00:17:10.461
Um, hi.

294
00:17:10.612 --> 00:17:12.037
Is it him?

295
00:17:12.131 --> 00:17:14.189
Uh, how nice to hear from you.

296
00:17:14.282 --> 00:17:15.857
Jack:
Am I calling at a bad time?


297
00:17:15.876 --> 00:17:18.302
No. Not at all.

298
00:17:18.529 --> 00:17:21.213
We just seem to have
a bad connection.


299
00:17:21.307 --> 00:17:22.639
My bars are dropping
like flies over here.


300
00:17:22.791 --> 00:17:24.641
- Flies?
- I don't know.


301
00:17:24.868 --> 00:17:28.870
Jack: I was just calling because
I've been thinking of you.


302
00:17:28.889 --> 00:17:30.038
Oh.

303
00:17:30.057 --> 00:17:31.631
Jack: This might seem
rather bold of me,


304
00:17:31.725 --> 00:17:33.466
but I'm only in town
for a short while


305
00:17:33.486 --> 00:17:36.394
and I'd quite like to
make the most of it.


306
00:17:36.489 --> 00:17:37.804
Are you asking me out?

307
00:17:37.898 --> 00:17:40.974
Jack:
I suppose I am.


308
00:17:40.993 --> 00:17:43.051
- (squealing)
- Okay. Uh, yeah.


309
00:17:43.144 --> 00:17:44.811
Let me just check my schedule.

310
00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:47.239
Ooh. You are in luck.

311
00:17:47.391 --> 00:17:48.749
I have
a last-minute cancelation.


312
00:17:50.410 --> 00:17:53.395
Jack:
Splendid. How does brunch sound?


313
00:17:53.413 --> 00:17:55.005
It sounds like the meal
between breakfast and lunch.


314
00:17:55.232 --> 00:17:57.090
What are you doing?

315
00:17:59.086 --> 00:18:02.070
So, um, when were you thinking?

316
00:18:02.089 --> 00:18:05.574
Jack:
I was thinking how about now?


317
00:18:05.667 --> 00:18:07.576
Excuse me?

318
00:18:07.669 --> 00:18:09.019
Jack:
Look out the front window.


319
00:18:18.255 --> 00:18:19.696
Oh! Hi.

320
00:18:19.923 --> 00:18:22.607
(laughing nervously)
Um, yeah. That sounds great.


321
00:18:22.701 --> 00:18:25.277
I will be down in one second.

322
00:18:25.371 --> 00:18:26.537
I'll see you soon.

323
00:18:28.707 --> 00:18:30.432
Rachel, how does he know
where our office is?


324
00:18:30.525 --> 00:18:31.933
I'm sure he knows
how to use the internet,


325
00:18:32.027 --> 00:18:33.769
or how to order someone else to.

326
00:18:33.862 --> 00:18:35.437
I'll bet he knows how to give

327
00:18:35.530 --> 00:18:36.863
all sorts of
interesting commands.


328
00:18:36.957 --> 00:18:38.774
- Rachel...
- Go.


329
00:18:38.792 --> 00:18:40.275
You've got six more seconds
or I'm getting a divorce,


330
00:18:40.368 --> 00:18:42.052
learning to slouch
and going down there myself.


331
00:18:42.279 --> 00:18:43.628
Do I slouch?

332
00:18:43.781 --> 00:18:44.888
Go.

333
00:18:45.115 --> 00:18:46.390
Uh, okay.

334
00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:56.233
Jack:
What?


335
00:18:59.146 --> 00:19:01.071
I like your glasses.

336
00:19:01.222 --> 00:19:03.574
They help me hide
while out in the open,


337
00:19:03.725 --> 00:19:05.742
rendering me
completely unrecognizable.


338
00:19:05.894 --> 00:19:07.485
You disagree?

339
00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:09.471
No. Not at all.

340
00:19:09.489 --> 00:19:12.140
You're like Superman
and Clark Kent.


341
00:19:12.159 --> 00:19:13.975
I'll take that as a compliment.

342
00:19:13.994 --> 00:19:15.994
- Next time I'll wear my cape.
- Mmm.


343
00:19:16.146 --> 00:19:18.422
That will really complete
the look.


344
00:19:32.438 --> 00:19:34.679
Enjoying the view?

345
00:19:34.832 --> 00:19:38.609
It's just feels so strange
being driven around by a prince.


346
00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:40.110
(laughing)

347
00:19:40.261 --> 00:19:43.429
Well, just pretend I'm

348
00:19:43.449 --> 00:19:46.007
a slightly overpriced chauffeur.

349
00:19:46.026 --> 00:19:47.451
I'll try.

350
00:19:48.679 --> 00:19:50.454
We're almost there.

351
00:19:55.853 --> 00:19:56.868
(scrumming)

352
00:19:57.020 --> 00:19:58.128
- Jack, over here.
- Jack?


353
00:19:59.523 --> 00:20:00.872
Is this all for you?

354
00:20:01.024 --> 00:20:02.023
Possibly.

355
00:20:02.042 --> 00:20:03.859
There might also be
a few pop stars


356
00:20:03.877 --> 00:20:06.452
laying low by the pool, though.

357
00:20:06.546 --> 00:20:08.788
Ah, our third wheel.

358
00:20:08.882 --> 00:20:12.217
You shouldn't be traveling in
the city without a guard, sir.


359
00:20:12.369 --> 00:20:13.626
Your brother would not approve.

360
00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:15.628
Well, you should do a better job
keeping tabs on me then.


361
00:20:15.648 --> 00:20:17.539
(reporters clamoring)

362
00:20:17.632 --> 00:20:19.391
Photographer:
Right here!


363
00:20:19.485 --> 00:20:21.559
Thank you. Thank you.

364
00:20:21.712 --> 00:20:23.378
- Get back.
- Jack! Jack!


365
00:20:23.397 --> 00:20:24.321
Who's the new mystery girl?

366
00:20:24.548 --> 00:20:27.565
Jack, please!
Any comment on the girl?


367
00:20:27.718 --> 00:20:31.903
(light jazz playing)

368
00:20:32.055 --> 00:20:35.056
Where is everyone?
The place looks deserted.


369
00:20:35.075 --> 00:20:39.394
Well, I called in a favor
to ensure our privacy.


370
00:20:39.413 --> 00:20:41.838
- This is all for us?
- Jack: No more distractions.


371
00:20:42.065 --> 00:20:44.082
Just us.

372
00:20:44.234 --> 00:20:46.301
Please.

373
00:20:50.182 --> 00:20:51.682
Alyssa: Thank you.

374
00:20:56.855 --> 00:20:58.689
Jack: All right.

375
00:21:01.084 --> 00:21:04.010
What about your personal life?

376
00:21:04.029 --> 00:21:06.604
It must be hard to find balance.

377
00:21:06.699 --> 00:21:09.348
Well, I don't know that I've
ever had a personal life.


378
00:21:09.368 --> 00:21:11.776
From the moment I was born,
I've been under scrutiny.


379
00:21:11.929 --> 00:21:13.704
And to the public,
I'm duty-bound


380
00:21:13.855 --> 00:21:17.432
to present a picture
of nobility, stiff upper lip.


381
00:21:17.451 --> 00:21:22.045
The truth is... all families
have their problems.


382
00:21:22.197 --> 00:21:24.197
It's just that ours
they refer to as scandals.


383
00:21:24.216 --> 00:21:28.944
I think I read
somewhere in a tabloid


384
00:21:28.962 --> 00:21:30.721
about a feud with your brother.

385
00:21:32.891 --> 00:21:35.708
Don't believe
everything you read.


386
00:21:35.728 --> 00:21:39.287
No, we have our disagreements,
but it's no Game of Thrones.


387
00:21:39.306 --> 00:21:41.714
It's mostly just
petty arguments.


388
00:21:41.734 --> 00:21:45.218
You know, who gets to sit in
front for group portraits,


389
00:21:45.237 --> 00:21:47.386
who uses which vacation house,

390
00:21:47.406 --> 00:21:49.965
stupid gossip, things like that.

391
00:21:49.983 --> 00:21:52.558
Hmm. So, means
you don't have a dragon.


392
00:21:52.652 --> 00:21:54.727
Only on our coat of arms.

393
00:21:54.821 --> 00:21:58.749
It must be so fascinating to be
a part of such history.


394
00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:02.310
I can barely trace my family
past my great-grandmother.


395
00:22:02.329 --> 00:22:05.480
Sometimes tradition is a trap.

396
00:22:05.499 --> 00:22:07.406
At the moment,
I'm much more focused


397
00:22:07.501 --> 00:22:09.259
on what lies ahead of me.

398
00:22:14.099 --> 00:22:16.600
Can I tell you a secret?

399
00:22:18.161 --> 00:22:22.330
Yes. I am PR -
gossip is my trade.

Oh, no. I shouldn't.

across the Atlantic

Some of these old doors

still have automatic
locking mechanisms -

01:03:13.890 --> 01:03:15.281
Oh, thank you so much.

976
01:03:15.374 --> 01:03:16.557
It's really nice
to meet you both.


977
01:03:16.709 --> 01:03:18.059
No chef on the staff
this evening,


978
01:03:18.210 --> 01:03:20.210
so I took the
liberty of preparing


979
01:03:20.230 --> 01:03:22.471
my semi-famous
stew and dumplings.


980
01:03:22.565 --> 01:03:24.123
Everyone, dig in.

981
01:03:24.216 --> 01:03:28.961
Yes, apologies for the fare.
We don't always eat like kings.


982
01:03:28.980 --> 01:03:31.464
So, how long have
you two been dating?


983
01:03:31.482 --> 01:03:34.800
Not long. It's been
sort of a whirlwind romance.


984
01:03:34.819 --> 01:03:36.393
Timothy: Where did you meet?

985
01:03:36.412 --> 01:03:37.745
At an event in New York.

986
01:03:37.972 --> 01:03:39.805
Does your friend speak
for herself, Jack,


987
01:03:39.824 --> 01:03:42.157
or are you practicing
your ventriloquist act?


988
01:03:42.252 --> 01:03:43.567
(clearing throat)

989
01:03:43.661 --> 01:03:48.256
Um, Jack is right; it really
was love at first sight.


990
01:03:48.483 --> 01:03:49.982
Oh.

991
01:03:50.001 --> 01:03:51.259
Hey!

992
01:03:51.410 --> 01:03:54.428
Mum, she took the tablet
and she won't give it back,


993
01:03:54.580 --> 01:03:56.913
and it's my birthday!

994
01:03:56.933 --> 01:03:59.325
Can we please go
one day without an episode?


995
01:03:59.343 --> 01:04:02.085
(sighing)

996
01:04:02.179 --> 01:04:03.846
Now, you both have one.

997
01:04:03.940 --> 01:04:06.682
The password is 1-1-9-2.

998
01:04:06.834 --> 01:04:08.776
Children!

999
01:04:11.281 --> 01:04:12.671
Such a little miracle,
parenthood.


1000
01:04:12.690 --> 01:04:13.856
Maybe, one day,

1001
01:04:14.008 --> 01:04:15.449
I'll be lucky enough to
find out for myself.


1002
01:04:18.529 --> 01:04:21.289
Alyssa...
are you okay?


1003
01:04:21.516 --> 01:04:25.701
Yes. I just...
have a pain in my stomach.


1004
01:04:25.853 --> 01:04:26.961
Would you excuse me?

1005
01:04:27.112 --> 01:04:29.797
Of course. Just down
the hall and to your right


1006
01:04:29.948 --> 01:04:30.965
Alyssa: Thank you.

1007
01:04:47.041 --> 01:04:50.818
(breathing heavily)

1008

"Call the police."

1012
01:05:15.494 --> 01:05:18.404
This was extremely ill-advised.

1013
01:05:18.497 --> 01:05:22.257
There are children here,
innocents.


1014
01:05:22.410 --> 01:05:24.143
You'd place them all in danger?

1015
01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:30.583
What is going on here?
Am I a prisoner?


1016
01:05:30.676 --> 01:05:32.935
Please, just open the door

1017
01:05:33.087 --> 01:05:35.921
and you will never hear
from me ever again.


1018
01:05:35.940 --> 01:05:39.592
We both know that
can't happen, miss.


1019
01:05:39.610 --> 01:05:43.779
Once the prince
has seen his brother off,


1020
01:05:43.931 --> 01:05:45.948
he will explain everything.

1021
01:05:46.100 --> 01:05:48.191
Please...

1022
01:05:48.211 --> 01:05:52.362
Please just let me go. Please.

1023
01:05:52.456 --> 01:05:54.698
Please let me go. Please.

1024
01:05:54.792 --> 01:05:58.277
I am no ally to you, miss.

1025
01:05:58.295 --> 01:06:00.054
My loyalty is to the Crown.

1026
01:06:19.075 --> 01:06:21.892
She seems quite nice,
if a trifle soft-spoken.


1027
01:06:21.911 --> 01:06:24.637
Do you imagine this
one might linger awhile?


1028
01:06:24.730 --> 01:06:26.138
What is that supposed to mean?

1029
01:06:26.157 --> 01:06:27.640
I think what Timothy means

1030
01:06:27.658 --> 01:06:30.325
is it would be nice for you to
finally settle down, Jack,


1031
01:06:30.478 --> 01:06:32.068
perhaps provide your nieces

1032
01:06:32.088 --> 01:06:33.996
and nephews some
cousins to play with.


1033
01:06:34.148 --> 01:06:35.831
Settle down to a life
of waving to buffoons


1034
01:06:35.983 --> 01:06:37.166
from the backs of Bentleys?

1035
01:06:37.318 --> 01:06:40.002
Please, just run me through now.

1036
01:06:40.154 --> 01:06:42.096
You can spurn your duties
all you like, Jack,


1037
01:06:42.323 --> 01:06:44.915
but you won't turn
your back on this family,


1038
01:06:44.934 --> 01:06:48.269
I won't allow it.

bloodlines, brother -


1042

cousins to King Henry,
to Mad King George!


1043
01:07:00.508 --> 01:07:02.007
And you want me to be normal?

1044
01:07:02.100 --> 01:07:05.286
Settle down and sire some heirs?

1045
01:07:05.513 --> 01:07:07.121
Timothy: Your lifestyle
is unsustainable.

You can't be the tabloids'

forever, Jack.
