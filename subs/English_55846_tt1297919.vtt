1
00:01:07.679 --> 00:01:10.216
Hello, lads.

2
00:01:10.307 --> 00:01:11.763
Fuck off, old man...

3
00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.465
Yeah, you old git.

4
00:01:13.602 --> 00:01:15.217
... or I'll smash your head in.

5
00:01:15.312 --> 00:01:17.098
Yeah, give us your
fucking wallet, you cunt.


6
00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.601
This lads...

7
00:01:23.695 --> 00:01:27.279
is a hurley, used in the
Irish game of hurling...


8
00:01:27.366 --> 00:01:29.857
a cross between hockey and murder.

9
00:01:29.951 --> 00:01:30.861
You fuck...

10
00:01:32.746 --> 00:01:35.579
Why don't l carve my
name in your fucking face!


11
00:01:35.666 --> 00:01:37.281
Hold on, hold on.

12
00:01:37.376 --> 00:01:39.082
Fucking kill him!

13
00:01:39.169 --> 00:01:40.784
Is that a carpet knife?

14
00:01:58.063 --> 00:02:01.271
Jesus wept. I've been looking
for one of these for weeks...


15
00:02:01.358 --> 00:02:04.816
but this carpet just keeps turning up.

16
00:02:11.827 --> 00:02:15.115
A word of advice, girls.

17
00:02:17.124 --> 00:02:19.456
If you're picking the wrong fight...

18
00:02:19.584 --> 00:02:21.791
at least pick the right weapon.

19
00:03:18.477 --> 00:03:21.514
Now, Sergeant, I'd like
you to tell me once again...


20
00:03:21.646 --> 00:03:24.353
about your violent urges.

21
00:03:24.441 --> 00:03:28.525
Uh, I must insist that
you extinguish that.


22
00:03:28.612 --> 00:03:34.323
And you'll do what, exactly,
if I don't? Arrest me?


23
00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:38.197
I'm not sure you realize the
gravity of your situation.


24
00:03:38.288 --> 00:03:42.748
Nice pen.

25
00:03:42.834 --> 00:03:44.040
Sergeant?

26
00:03:44.127 --> 00:03:45.867
Nice pen, I said.

27
00:03:45.962 --> 00:03:47.998
Says a lot about you.

28
00:03:48.089 --> 00:03:50.751
Oh, is that so? Pray tell.

29
00:03:50.842 --> 00:03:55.381
You like a solid phallic
symbol between your fingers.


30
00:03:55.472 --> 00:03:59.056
Sergeant Brant, in the last year...

31
00:03:59.184 --> 00:04:02.676
you've been charged with bugging
the Superintendent's office...


32
00:04:02.771 --> 00:04:05.387
beating a felon unconscious
in a billiards hall...


33
00:04:05.482 --> 00:04:09.316
and just last week you assaulted
three innocent youths...


34
00:04:09.402 --> 00:04:12.644
with a hockey stick. 
Shall I go on?

35
00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:17.233
My report will be a major factor
in whether you remain in the force.


36
00:04:22.165 --> 00:04:24.577
Ser... Sergeant Brant, sit down.

37
00:04:30.757 --> 00:04:32.998
The thing is, Doc...

38
00:04:33.093 --> 00:04:38.838
this is the only work l can
do, and if I get bounced...


39
00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:42.428
I'm sure I'll do
something truly reckless.


40
00:04:53.363 --> 00:04:54.853
Hi.

41
00:05:04.249 --> 00:05:06.786
You got a minute for me?

42
00:05:06.877 --> 00:05:10.085
Yeah. What is it?

43
00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:12.371
I don't know.

44
00:05:12.507 --> 00:05:16.876
I thought two years undercover on the
Drug Squad would help me out, but...


45
00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:19.461
I don't know.

46
00:05:19.598 --> 00:05:22.840
I thought maybe my past
went against me or...


47
00:05:22.893 --> 00:05:26.135
I failed the Sergeant�s exam.

48
00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:27.890
Everyone fails the first time.

49
00:05:27.981 --> 00:05:30.518
Did you?

50
00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:35.440
Now you've only been out of
rehab a few months. Give it time.


51
00:05:35.572 --> 00:05:39.281
Falls, go grab some piss
poor tea in the canteen, okay?


52
00:05:48.376 --> 00:05:51.789
You don't wanna believe what
you read in the papers, sir.


53
00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.121
It's not what this
station needs right now.


54
00:05:54.215 --> 00:05:57.673
You know we can't afford
any more bad publicity.


55
00:06:01.181 --> 00:06:04.218
Imagine you walk down the street...

56
00:06:04.309 --> 00:06:07.676
and you bump into three blokes
carrying carpeting knives.


57
00:06:07.771 --> 00:06:11.889
Nah, they're not carpet fitters.
They're after your wallet.


58
00:06:11.983 --> 00:06:13.894
Maybe even that gold watch...

59
00:06:13.985 --> 00:06:17.102
that you got for the highest
arrest rate in the Southeast.


60
00:06:17.238 --> 00:06:21.572
One of the rats there even very kindly
offered to carve their name in your face.


61
00:06:21.701 --> 00:06:25.444
Now, would you be more worried about
whether you're gonna have a fight...


62
00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:29.118
than how it looks in the papers?

63
00:06:29.209 --> 00:06:34.704
Well, just keep a low profile until
this little shit storm blows over.


64
00:06:49.729 --> 00:06:52.061
Business is brisk.

65
00:06:57.237 --> 00:06:58.977
Have that, Daniel.

66
00:06:59.072 --> 00:07:02.906
I don't think I can
go through with this.


67
00:07:02.993 --> 00:07:06.451
You'll be okay. It'll
be over in no time.


68
00:07:06.579 --> 00:07:08.285
You think I should've gone for a burial?

69
00:07:08.373 --> 00:07:10.238
No.

70
00:07:10.291 --> 00:07:15.126
You'll be glad.

71
00:07:15.213 --> 00:07:18.421
We're ready for you, 
Inspector Roberts.

72
00:07:18.508 --> 00:07:20.999
Go on.

73
00:07:24.597 --> 00:07:27.680
Who got the flowers?

74
00:07:27.767 --> 00:07:29.974
Owner of a stall in
Streatham owed me a favor.


75
00:07:30.061 --> 00:07:32.302
Does a clean line in fruit and veg.

76
00:07:32.397 --> 00:07:35.059
It's time.

77
00:07:39.195 --> 00:07:43.063
Got some last words, Gov?

78
00:08:06.056 --> 00:08:09.765
We'll miss you, love.

79
00:08:13.354 --> 00:08:16.721
Coats and Hammond, as quick as you can.

80
00:08:19.319 --> 00:08:22.061
Let's get you legless.

81
00:08:31.915 --> 00:08:34.076
Where's Fiona?

82
00:08:34.167 --> 00:08:35.407
What?

83
00:08:35.502 --> 00:08:37.834
The urn, Brant.

84
00:08:37.921 --> 00:08:40.287
Where the fuck's the urn?

85
00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:46.752
Someone must've nicked that.

86
00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:58.642
One of these guys.

87
00:09:01.528 --> 00:09:03.860
Up, up and away.

88
00:09:05.406 --> 00:09:08.022
We need a detective.

89
00:09:24.467 --> 00:09:26.628
All right.

90
00:09:38.773 --> 00:09:41.480
Fuck you, pig.

91
00:09:58.293 --> 00:10:00.579
Brant, are you there?

92
00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:01.705
Brant!

93
00:10:01.796 --> 00:10:03.832
What?

94
00:10:03.923 --> 00:10:06.289
We need you down at
Smithfield yesterday, Brant.


95
00:10:06.384 --> 00:10:08.295
An officer is down.
All hands to the pump...


96
00:10:08.386 --> 00:10:10.502
and don 't go talking to
any fucking journalists.


97
00:10:10.638 --> 00:10:12.128
Sir?

98
00:10:12.223 --> 00:10:15.090
I'm throwing you a bone, Brant!

99
00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:18.601
The officer is Sandra Bates...

100
00:10:18.688 --> 00:10:20.770
O h, no. It can't be.

101
00:10:20.899 --> 00:10:24.892
The assailant is armed and dangerous...

102
00:10:32.243 --> 00:10:34.404
That is some dress.

103
00:10:34.495 --> 00:10:36.281
Yeah, well you look shitty.

104
00:10:36.331 --> 00:10:39.289
I've been consoling the
Inspector. His wife passed.


105
00:10:39.375 --> 00:10:41.411
Yeah. I heard.

106
00:10:41.502 --> 00:10:46.292
I knew Sandra. We were at
Police College together.


107
00:10:46.382 --> 00:10:48.589
Brant.

108
00:10:48.676 --> 00:10:50.257
Was there something?

109
00:10:50.345 --> 00:10:51.835
Sir? There's a witness.

110
00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:54.888
What? Why wasn't I told?

111
00:10:54.974 --> 00:10:57.886
I've been trying to tell you
for the past half an hour.


112
00:10:57.977 --> 00:11:00.468
Take his statement.

113
00:11:09.197 --> 00:11:12.439
The dead policewoman
has been identified as...


114
00:11:12.575 --> 00:11:16.113
as 26-year-old Sandra
Bates of Camberwell.


115
00:11:16.204 --> 00:11:18.616
Described as a credit to her force...

116
00:11:18.706 --> 00:11:20.992
she was shot at point blank range...

117
00:11:21.084 --> 00:11:22.870
and died instantly.

118
00:11:22.961 --> 00:11:25.293
And now from our
Washington correspondent...


119
00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:30.381
It's Tony, right?

120
00:11:30.468 --> 00:11:32.174
Anthony. You're Brant, right?

121
00:11:32.262 --> 00:11:34.002
You know me?

122
00:11:34.097 --> 00:11:36.804
Who doesn�t? Last year
at Camberwell billiards...


123
00:11:36.891 --> 00:11:40.179
when that nutter come in with a
crowbar, attacked a couple of mates?


124
00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:41.976
You rocked up, beat matey to a pulp.

125
00:11:42.063 --> 00:11:43.473
That makes me think you're a legend.

126
00:11:43.606 --> 00:11:46.393
I'm flattered. 
They got names?

127
00:11:46.484 --> 00:11:48.816
That's Posh. That's Becks.

128
00:11:48.903 --> 00:11:50.143
Posh and fucking Becks?

129
00:11:50.238 --> 00:11:52.479
You're fucking right.

130
00:11:52.615 --> 00:11:55.652
So run the description by me again.

131
00:11:55.743 --> 00:11:58.155
Ain't you gonna take any notes?

132
00:11:58.246 --> 00:12:01.830
Do I look like I carry a pencil?

133
00:12:20.435 --> 00:12:22.767
Morning. I'm Porter Nash.

134
00:12:22.854 --> 00:12:27.644
Superintendent Brown said to talk
to you about getting a locker.


135
00:12:55.219 --> 00:12:57.961
Due to the recent death of his wife...

136
00:12:58.056 --> 00:13:00.843
Chief Inspector Roberts
is on extended leave.


137
00:13:00.892 --> 00:13:03.850
I'm therefore promoting
Sergeant Porter Nash...


138
00:13:03.936 --> 00:13:06.018
to Acting Inspector...

139
00:13:06.105 --> 00:13:07.265
and temporary head of the inquiry.

140
00:13:07.357 --> 00:13:08.688
Sir?

141
00:13:08.775 --> 00:13:10.515
Yes?

142
00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:13.067
Shouldn't we promote one of our own?

143
00:13:13.154 --> 00:13:16.066
Now, now gents. I don
't need to remind you...


144
00:13:16.157 --> 00:13:18.694
that we're already the
focus of a media circus.


145
00:13:18.826 --> 00:13:22.910
Sergeant Nash comes to us from the
prestigious West London branch...


146
00:13:22.997 --> 00:13:26.990
and it is my opinion that he will
instill a level of professionalism...


147
00:13:27.085 --> 00:13:30.452
hitherto lacking in our
primitive Southeast Division.


148
00:13:55.196 --> 00:13:58.108
I'm coming in.

149
00:13:58.199 --> 00:14:02.158
You look like shit.

150
00:14:02.245 --> 00:14:04.327
Take that hood off your head.

151
00:14:04.414 --> 00:14:05.995
I'm in trouble.

152
00:14:06.082 --> 00:14:08.243
You got any beers or anything?

153
00:14:08.334 --> 00:14:09.995
You know I haven't.

154
00:14:10.086 --> 00:14:12.042
Sit down.

155
00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:13.916
Talk.

156
00:14:14.006 --> 00:14:16.418
Well, me, Macky and Bowes were

157
00:14:16.509 --> 00:14:21.424
What? Looking for a madness?

158
00:14:21.514 --> 00:14:23.846
I think we killed someone.

159
00:14:23.891 --> 00:14:25.677
Some camel jockey.

160
00:14:25.768 --> 00:14:28.384
Sorry, I mean an Indian guy.

161
00:14:28.479 --> 00:14:31.471
He weren't moving.

162
00:14:34.819 --> 00:14:37.060
Okay.

163
00:14:37.155 --> 00:14:39.066
Okay, I'll look into it.

164
00:14:39.157 --> 00:14:40.647
Thank you...

165
00:14:40.741 --> 00:14:43.448
Shut up. I ain't finished yet.

166
00:14:43.578 --> 00:14:46.240
If he's dead, you're on your own.

167
00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:50.289
Yeah? In fact, I�ll come round
your yard and nick you myself.


168
00:14:50.376 --> 00:14:54.415
Now you go home and you
wait till you hear from me.


169
00:14:56.090 --> 00:14:59.332
It's choice time, John. 
If he lives...

170
00:14:59.427 --> 00:15:03.090
you either quit that gang or you quit
coming round here, you understand?


171
00:15:03.181 --> 00:15:04.136
Yeah.

172
00:15:04.223 --> 00:15:05.463
Yeah, what?

173
00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:10.390
Yes, ma'am.

174
00:15:13.065 --> 00:15:16.023
Brant, can l have a word?

175
00:15:16.110 --> 00:15:19.898
I just need to have a quick chat.

176
00:15:25.077 --> 00:15:27.033
So what can l do for you?

177
00:15:27.121 --> 00:15:30.454
I need a favor.

178
00:15:30.583 --> 00:15:35.668
A friend of mine is in trouble.
I need to get him off the hook.


179
00:15:35.755 --> 00:15:37.211
Someone you're riding?

180
00:15:37.298 --> 00:15:41.007
What? No, nothing like that.

181
00:15:41.052 --> 00:15:43.168
He's a kid.

182
00:15:43.262 --> 00:15:45.753
There's a DI. I used to
know him from way back.


183
00:15:45.848 --> 00:15:48.260
We shared a snitch in
Brixton. He'll be able to help.


184
00:15:48.351 --> 00:15:49.431
Name?

185
00:15:49.519 --> 00:15:52.386
Stokes. Craig Stokes.

186
00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:53.811
Thank you.

187
00:15:53.898 --> 00:15:56.059
Now you owe me one.

188
00:16:05.201 --> 00:16:07.283
Harold Dunlop.

189
00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:09.736
I read your stuff in the papers.

190
00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:12.321
I've got some information
on the police killings.


191
00:16:12.416 --> 00:16:14.748
All rig ht. Hang on.

192
00:16:22.051 --> 00:16:23.382
All right. Fire away.

193
00:16:23.469 --> 00:16:25.380
Aw, have some fucking manners.

194
00:16:25.471 --> 00:16:28.713
I'm offering you information.
You don't even say hello.


195
00:16:28.808 --> 00:16:31.049
It's a pleasure to make your
acquaintance. Is that better?


196
00:16:31.143 --> 00:16:33.259
I detest sarcasm.

197
00:16:33.396 --> 00:16:38.265
Maybe I'll start on journalists
when I've finished my cop quota.


198
00:16:40.528 --> 00:16:42.314
Oh, uh, heh...

199
00:16:42.405 --> 00:16:44.111
Listen fellow.

200
00:16:44.198 --> 00:16:46.564
You and me got off to the
wrong start, didn't we?


201
00:16:46.659 --> 00:16:48.274
So let's try again now.

202
00:16:48.369 --> 00:16:50.155
What's your name?

203
00:16:50.246 --> 00:16:52.487
Oh, Christ. I'm not sure
you're even up to the task.


204
00:16:52.623 --> 00:16:54.204
What task?

205
00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:58.459
Reporting from inside
the police killings?


206
00:17:01.257 --> 00:17:04.875
Where are you on the food
chain? You got any clout?


207
00:17:05.011 --> 00:17:08.469
Well, I'm a staff writer in
the crime department, yeah.


208
00:17:08.598 --> 00:17:12.841
I can make you famous.

209
00:17:12.935 --> 00:17:15.722
Yo there, copper! Remember me?

210
00:17:15.771 --> 00:17:16.726
Do you want something?

211
00:17:16.772 --> 00:17:17.682
Thing.

212
00:17:17.732 --> 00:17:19.313
What?

213
00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:21.186
It's 'something' not somethink. '

214
00:17:21.277 --> 00:17:23.768
You should at least be
able to speak properly.


215
00:17:23.863 --> 00:17:25.569
Look, get lost mate, yeah?

216
00:17:25.656 --> 00:17:28.272
I've got a question,
yeah? What would you do...


217
00:17:28.367 --> 00:17:31.200
if I was to call you a cunt?

218
00:17:31.287 --> 00:17:34.199
Which do you prefer? 
Seven or eight?

219
00:17:34.290 --> 00:17:35.746
Eight.

220
00:17:35.833 --> 00:17:37.698
Eight it is.

221
00:17:37.793 --> 00:17:39.579
Hang on. What? Eight what?

222
00:17:41.881 --> 00:17:44.122
Eight more coppers to kill. Bye.

223
00:17:44.216 --> 00:17:46.172
What...

224
00:18:17.833 --> 00:18:20.666
Cup of tea and a biscuit.

225
00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:30.843
Are you as black as you're painted?

226
00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:33.296
Are you as Nancy as they say?

227
00:18:33.432 --> 00:18:36.424
Thing is, Brant, if there's a problem,
I'm gonna need to know about it.


228
00:18:36.519 --> 00:18:38.430
There's a problem, all right.

229
00:18:38.521 --> 00:18:41.228
Some sick fuck is killing policemen...

230
00:18:41.315 --> 00:18:43.772
and he's only just started.

231
00:18:43.859 --> 00:18:45.565
I meant between us.

232
00:18:45.653 --> 00:18:48.269
I know what you meant.

233
00:18:48.406 --> 00:18:53.571
Problem? Not unless you
follow me into public toilets.


234
00:18:53.661 --> 00:18:57.449
So I don't get to be head
boy. Big fucking deal.


235
00:18:57.581 --> 00:18:59.572
Less paperwork for me.

236
00:19:01.252 --> 00:19:03.334
There's nothing, sir.

237
00:19:03.462 --> 00:19:04.827
See if you can get me a
possible match of the bullet.


238
00:19:04.922 --> 00:19:06.378
Yes, sir.

239
00:19:09.385 --> 00:19:11.467
Just keep it open for me, for now.

240
00:19:11.595 --> 00:19:16.259
Move your right and take your
fucking left hand up and over.


241
00:19:18.227 --> 00:19:20.764
Aw, fuck me. Not you again, mate.

242
00:19:20.896 --> 00:19:22.602
I'll keep coming back
until you get me a knife.


243
00:19:22.690 --> 00:19:24.271
Keep your right hand
up. I keep telling ya.


244
00:19:24.358 --> 00:19:25.973
You're getting caught with your left up.

245
00:19:26.068 --> 00:19:28.480
No, that's not him.

246
00:19:30.156 --> 00:19:34.399
Yeah, please. That's quite important.

247
00:19:34.452 --> 00:19:36.488
Want me to widen the
area for questioning?


248
00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:38.702
Great, yeah. Great idea.

249
00:19:38.789 --> 00:19:40.404
The gun was a 9mm semi-automatic.

250
00:19:40.499 --> 00:19:42.239
A SIG or a Glock?

251
00:19:42.334 --> 00:19:43.995
I'll go on to forensics now.

252
00:19:44.086 --> 00:19:45.292
No?

253
00:19:45.379 --> 00:19:46.744
I don't fucking know.

254
00:19:46.839 --> 00:19:48.170
I don't know!

255
00:19:48.257 --> 00:19:50.043
I wanna know the name

256
00:19:50.134 --> 00:19:52.045
of every punk that you sold

257
00:19:52.136 --> 00:19:54.422
a 9 mil semi-automatic pistol
to in the last few months.


258
00:19:54.513 --> 00:19:56.595
He's got his back turned every time.

259
00:19:56.682 --> 00:19:59.048
He knows where the cameras are.

260
00:19:59.143 --> 00:20:00.258
Don't make me come back

261
00:20:00.352 --> 00:20:01.762
and give me the same

262
00:20:01.812 --> 00:20:03.393
fucking silly answers, all right?

263
00:20:03.481 --> 00:20:05.688
I'll ring you when I've got something.

264
00:20:05.775 --> 00:20:07.982
I want the name, address
and fucking postal code.


265
00:20:08.068 --> 00:20:10.559
Sarge, come have a look at this?

266
00:20:10.654 --> 00:20:14.863
We've got no footage of the
killing of the second officer.


267
00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:16.815
There must be more. Keep looking.

268
00:20:16.911 --> 00:20:18.117
Sir.

269
00:20:28.964 --> 00:20:30.920
You know what I want...

270
00:20:31.008 --> 00:20:32.999
so spill.

271
00:20:33.052 --> 00:20:35.919
Well, I need paying first.

272
00:20:40.184 --> 00:20:42.516
What do you have in mind?

273
00:20:42.645 --> 00:20:44.601
Serious.

274
00:20:44.688 --> 00:20:46.724
Serious money.

275
00:20:46.816 --> 00:20:48.147
Serious money?

276
00:20:48.234 --> 00:20:49.724
Mmm-hmm.

277
00:20:49.819 --> 00:20:52.401
What, like the time of benefit?

278
00:20:52.488 --> 00:20:53.273
Yeah.

279
00:20:55.991 --> 00:20:58.607
Bony fucker, aren't ya?

280
00:20:58.702 --> 00:21:02.911
You don't have the brains
of a chicken, do you?


281
00:21:05.876 --> 00:21:09.619
I doubt you have any real
Irish blood in you, Radnor.


282
00:21:09.713 --> 00:21:14.002
Me, I'm a wild streak and a
Celt. Makes me unpredictable.


283
00:21:14.051 --> 00:21:16.963
Them Irish. Did you know
they invented kneecap?


284
00:21:17.054 --> 00:21:19.386
It's a nasty business.

285
00:21:19.473 --> 00:21:21.839
They fix you up as best they can...

286
00:21:21.934 --> 00:21:25.677
but you'll always have a
limp. How does that sound?


287
00:21:25.771 --> 00:21:30.390
Radnor the gimp. How does that go
down in your retirement package?


288
00:21:34.655 --> 00:21:37.897
A brandy here, Paul. 
And a large scotch.

289
00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:43.823
Here's what we'll do.

290
00:21:43.914 --> 00:21:49.659
We'll have a nice stiff
drink. Ought to fire us off.


291
00:21:52.756 --> 00:21:55.998
Well, go on, Rad. Pay the man.

292
00:21:56.051 --> 00:21:58.793
Well, l... I don't drink brandy.

293
00:22:04.143 --> 00:22:06.509
Yeah, keep the change.

294
00:22:08.898 --> 00:22:11.059
Okay, tell me.

295
00:22:14.236 --> 00:22:17.478
There's this bloke at the Peacock Gym.

296
00:22:17.573 --> 00:22:20.189
He set fire to a police dog.

297
00:22:20.284 --> 00:22:23.447
YouTubed it. Somebody asked
him why he did it. He said...


298
00:22:23.579 --> 00:22:27.413
"Practice."

299
00:22:27.499 --> 00:22:28.989
Well, that's it?

300
00:22:29.084 --> 00:22:30.995
Seriously, he's a nutter.

301
00:22:31.086 --> 00:22:32.997
Fuck, if we pulled in every
wanker who said that...


302
00:22:33.088 --> 00:22:34.669
we'd be up to our arse in suspects.

303
00:22:34.757 --> 00:22:36.213
What's his name?

304
00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:38.165
Well, I don't... I
don't... I don't know.


305
00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:40.922
But I'm meeting a guy later
who's gonna get it for me.


306
00:22:41.013 --> 00:22:44.301
Don't bother. I'll go to
the gym. Ask the manager.


307
00:22:44.391 --> 00:22:48.509
But you see, l... 
Don't I get something?

308
00:22:48.646 --> 00:22:52.605
I left you the rest of my
crisps, you greedy bugger.


309
00:22:52.650 --> 00:22:55.062
What more do you want?

310
00:22:55.152 --> 00:22:57.268
For fuck's sake.

311
00:22:57.363 --> 00:22:59.570
Are you fucking me?

312
00:22:59.657 --> 00:23:03.320
Can I have my change back, please?

313
00:23:03.410 --> 00:23:06.322
Fuck, I can't walk.

314
00:24:00.509 --> 00:24:03.922
Are you as black as you're painted?

315
00:24:24.825 --> 00:24:27.237
Disturbing you, am l?

316
00:24:27.327 --> 00:24:29.943
No, I was just
in the middle of eating.

317
00:24:30.039 --> 00:24:33.702
Go ahead. That's your Tex Mex, isn't it?

318
00:24:38.255 --> 00:24:40.120
Christ, what is that?

319
00:24:40.215 --> 00:24:43.127
Hare Krishna food?

320
00:24:43.218 --> 00:24:44.924
Better put some meat in you, boy.

321
00:24:44.970 --> 00:24:48.133
A big juicy steak.
Get the blood flowing.


322
00:24:48.223 --> 00:24:51.135
You know, the chaps had a word...

323
00:24:51.226 --> 00:24:54.184
for this type of bare look, didn't they?

324
00:24:54.271 --> 00:24:56.637
Minimalist.

325
00:24:56.690 --> 00:24:59.682
Shy is the word I had in mind.

326
00:24:59.777 --> 00:25:01.688
Can I get a drink, then?

327
00:25:01.779 --> 00:25:04.896
Over there. Help yourself.

328
00:25:06.575 --> 00:25:10.284
Jesus, no wonder you stay at home.

329
00:25:10.370 --> 00:25:12.611
So what are you having?

330
00:25:12.706 --> 00:25:15.789
I've got some water, thanks.

331
00:25:15.876 --> 00:25:20.461
Can I ask you why you're here?

332
00:25:20.589 --> 00:25:24.081
I need your advice.

333
00:25:24.176 --> 00:25:28.636
Look, I don't give a fuck
about you being a pillow biter.


334
00:25:28.722 --> 00:25:30.883
I don't give a fuck what people do...

335
00:25:30.974 --> 00:25:33.807
as long as they keep it to themselves.

336
00:25:35.771 --> 00:25:39.605
I respect you and
there's not many I do.

337
00:25:39.650 --> 00:25:42.392
What's the problem?

338
00:25:46.490 --> 00:25:48.446
I'm losing it.

339
00:25:48.575 --> 00:25:50.657
In what way?

340
00:25:54.957 --> 00:25:57.414
I'm blacking out.

341
00:25:57.501 --> 00:26:02.120
Not often, but enough to be worried.

342
00:26:02.172 --> 00:26:07.212
Don't wanna talk, eat.

343
00:26:07.302 --> 00:26:11.011
It's actually a huge effort
to drag myself outta bed.


344
00:26:14.143 --> 00:26:17.681
I just stare at the wall.

345
00:26:17.729 --> 00:26:20.971
Just do nothing, you know?

346
00:26:21.066 --> 00:26:23.148
Absolutely nothing.

347
00:26:23.235 --> 00:26:25.100
It's burnout.

348
00:26:25.195 --> 00:26:26.401
What?

349
00:26:26.488 --> 00:26:28.604
Your brain's on meltdown.

350
00:26:28.699 --> 00:26:30.280
A couple of days doing nothing...

351
00:26:30.367 --> 00:26:31.948
and you�ll start to come back.

352
00:26:32.035 --> 00:26:34.026
You sound pretty sure.

353
00:26:34.121 --> 00:26:36.282
Yeah, I am sure. 
I've been there myself.

354
00:26:36.331 --> 00:26:38.447
You?

355
00:26:38.584 --> 00:26:40.950
Yeah. I could barely work the microwave.

356
00:26:41.044 --> 00:26:43.126
I was fucked.

357
00:26:43.213 --> 00:26:46.296
We got this pedophile on
the loose in Holland Park.


358
00:26:46.383 --> 00:26:49.125
He was luring children into his car.

359
00:26:49.219 --> 00:26:52.461
We knew who he was but we just
couldn't catch him in the act.


360
00:26:52.598 --> 00:26:56.591
These kids were too
traumatized to identify him.


361
00:26:56.685 --> 00:26:58.846
He was this big showbiz agent, you know.

362
00:26:58.937 --> 00:27:01.349
Major connections.

363
00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:03.146
The guys back at the nick...

364
00:27:03.233 --> 00:27:05.019
they just about put
me on a par with him...


365
00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:06.975
because I was a queer, yeah?

366
00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:09.402
Wanked off into condoms and
leave them in my locker...


367
00:27:09.489 --> 00:27:12.731
scratched the car,
sugar in the petrol tank.


368
00:27:12.826 --> 00:27:14.441
All the usual shit.

369
00:27:14.578 --> 00:27:17.661
It put me under tremendous pressure.

370
00:27:17.748 --> 00:27:20.615
I was knocking back Valium,
shots at breakfast...


371
00:27:20.709 --> 00:27:22.290
two packs a day.

372
00:27:22.377 --> 00:27:24.959
So I thought, fuck it.

373
00:27:25.047 --> 00:27:28.164
I thought I'd take
matters into my own hands.


374
00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:30.962
And I broke into the pedophile's
house at 4:00 in the morning...


375
00:27:31.053 --> 00:27:33.795
and I smashed his bollocks
in with a baseball bat...


376
00:27:33.889 --> 00:27:36.881
until they fucking popped.

377
00:27:36.975 --> 00:27:38.840
I took a leave of absence after that.

378
00:27:38.936 --> 00:27:40.642
I was burnt out.

379
00:27:40.729 --> 00:27:43.095
Came back here, 
I shut the curtains.

380
00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:48.275
Pulled the phone out. 
Just hid away.

381
00:27:48.362 --> 00:27:51.946
I went back to work expecting the axe...

382
00:27:52.032 --> 00:27:55.650
but they ended up transferring me.

383
00:28:02.626 --> 00:28:05.038
Wanker.

384
00:28:24.231 --> 00:28:26.938
Morning. Want some breakfast?

385
00:28:27.025 --> 00:28:30.062
A coffee, two sugars.

386
00:28:35.450 --> 00:28:38.908
You had an affair with me?

387
00:28:38.996 --> 00:28:41.157
I held back.

388
00:28:41.248 --> 00:28:44.285
So any idea who we're looking for?

389
00:28:44.376 --> 00:28:48.164
A psycho. Whistles while he works.

390
00:28:48.255 --> 00:28:50.086
Showed up at Peacock Gym yesterday.

391
00:28:50.132 --> 00:28:52.669
I got the name
of a bloke in Nunhead.

392
00:28:52.759 --> 00:28:53.999
Worth a visit?

393
00:28:54.052 --> 00:28:55.713
You want me along?

394
00:28:55.804 --> 00:28:57.840
Sure. See you there in half an hour.

395
00:29:03.186 --> 00:29:07.896
Oh, yeah. The other thing, about
you being a good cop. I meant that.


396
00:29:07.983 --> 00:29:10.144
Thank you.

397
00:29:10.235 --> 00:29:13.568
For a poofter.

398
00:29:49.399 --> 00:29:51.264
You replaced me.

399
00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:52.475
You're on compassionate leave.

400
00:29:52.611 --> 00:29:54.522
I 'm back.

401
00:29:54.613 --> 00:29:58.652
Inspector Roberts,
losing a wife is not easy.


402
00:29:58.742 --> 00:30:00.152
You lost your wife?

403
00:30:00.243 --> 00:30:01.904
Well, no...

404
00:30:01.995 --> 00:30:04.077
How would you feel
about early retirement?


405
00:30:04.164 --> 00:30:06.826
We'd miss you, sir.

406
00:30:06.917 --> 00:30:08.873
You know who else would miss you?

407
00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:14.000
Olga, the 250-pound call
girl you see every Wednesday.


408
00:30:14.091 --> 00:30:16.457
Your wife thinks you're playing squash.

409
00:30:16.593 --> 00:30:20.177
Well, you are, in a way.

410
00:30:20.263 --> 00:30:24.222
I don't need a fanfare.
I don't need an office.


411
00:30:24.309 --> 00:30:25.890
I just wanna work.

412
00:30:25.977 --> 00:30:27.638
Well, what are you waiting for?

413
00:30:27.729 --> 00:30:29.310
Fuck off, Roberts.

414
00:30:29.398 --> 00:30:32.060
Go solve some crimes.

415
00:30:48.083 --> 00:30:50.950
Fuck.

416
00:30:52.838 --> 00:30:55.750
Police! Open up!

417
00:31:02.681 --> 00:31:04.342
Uh.

418
00:31:04.433 --> 00:31:07.300
Oh!

419
00:31:18.905 --> 00:31:21.396
Barry Weiss?

420
00:31:21.450 --> 00:31:23.111
That is me.

421
00:31:23.201 --> 00:31:25.487
Can we come in?

422
00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:27.576
Got a warrant?

423
00:31:27.664 --> 00:31:30.997
It's in the post.

424
00:31:52.105 --> 00:31:54.096
Can I get you anything?

425
00:31:54.191 --> 00:31:58.434
How about a cuppa, coppers?

426
00:31:58.528 --> 00:32:00.484
I know you.

427
00:32:00.572 --> 00:32:03.063
If we'd met, I'm sure I'd remember.

428
00:32:14.085 --> 00:32:15.996
You know what that is?

429
00:32:16.087 --> 00:32:19.500
Michael Jackson's shit.

430
00:32:19.633 --> 00:32:21.840
It's priceless.

431
00:32:21.927 --> 00:32:23.963
I got it off eBay.

432
00:32:24.054 --> 00:32:27.012
So what was it you were looking
for? Maybe I could help you.


433
00:32:27.098 --> 00:32:29.009
What do you do, Mr. Weiss?

434
00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:32.183
I'm between jobs.

435
00:32:32.270 --> 00:32:36.809
You like torching dogs, do ya?

436
00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:38.891
I saw your home movie.

437
00:32:38.985 --> 00:32:41.146
On YouTube, right?

438
00:32:41.238 --> 00:32:43.980
It got over 9,000 hits
before they took it down.


439
00:32:44.074 --> 00:32:46.907
I post... I posted it,
yeah, but I wasn't involved.


440
00:32:46.993 --> 00:32:49.359
Nah, I'm joking. 
I love animals, me.

441
00:32:49.454 --> 00:32:52.321
What about police, Barry? 
You like them?

442
00:32:52.415 --> 00:32:54.997
"Thank God," I say.

443
00:32:55.085 --> 00:32:59.249
I say "Thank God
for the men in blue."

444
00:32:59.339 --> 00:33:03.799
I remember you now, Barry.

445
00:33:03.885 --> 00:33:07.173
Yeah, you're the piece of
shit from the billiards hall.


446
00:33:11.226 --> 00:33:15.139
Back on your feet, I see.

447
00:33:16.898 --> 00:33:21.062
Come on, Nash. 
Let's get out of here.

448
00:33:29.995 --> 00:33:32.452
What was all that about?

449
00:33:32.581 --> 00:33:35.118
I had a run in with
him about a year ago.


450
00:33:35.208 --> 00:33:37.119
I might have put him in the hospital.

451
00:33:37.210 --> 00:33:39.326
Welcome to the liberal Southeast.

452
00:33:39.421 --> 00:33:41.628
It gets results.

453
00:33:41.715 --> 00:33:43.922
Let's just keep an eye on him.

454
00:33:44.009 --> 00:33:46.625
You just wait and see.

455
00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:48.836
Yeah?

456
00:33:52.475 --> 00:33:54.511
You wait and see.

457
00:33:56.855 --> 00:34:00.598
What are you fucking
looking at, you fucking perv?


458
00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:10.963
Fuck. Ow!

459
00:35:15.141 --> 00:35:18.349
Weiss. Nice.

460
00:35:25.652 --> 00:35:28.439
B. Weiss, P-23...

461
00:35:28.530 --> 00:35:32.944
Weymouth Parking. 
You little bastard.

462
00:37:10.924 --> 00:37:12.255
Who is it?

463
00:37:12.342 --> 00:37:14.958
Satellite TV.

464
00:37:15.053 --> 00:37:17.214
I've come for your box.

465
00:37:23.353 --> 00:37:25.685
What's the problem?
I just paid the bill.


466
00:37:25.730 --> 00:37:28.893
That's funny...

467
00:37:28.983 --> 00:37:30.644
because you are the bill.

468
00:37:30.735 --> 00:37:32.350
You're not the usual bloke...

469
00:37:34.572 --> 00:37:35.732
Ugh.

470
00:38:04.435 --> 00:38:06.096
Ah!

471
00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:08.811
Ah!

472
00:38:36.593 --> 00:38:39.801
Question two. Which Scottish
music hall comedian...


473
00:38:39.888 --> 00:38:41.424
B! B! B.

474
00:38:41.514 --> 00:38:43.220
A. Jack Milroy

475
00:38:43.308 --> 00:38:46.220
B. Andy Stewart or C. 
Sir Harry Lauder?

476
00:38:46.311 --> 00:38:49.144
B.

477
00:38:49.230 --> 00:38:53.644
Come on, you fucking idiot, B.

478
00:39:17.926 --> 00:39:19.791
Yes.

479
00:39:21.387 --> 00:39:23.252
Sweet.

480
00:39:47.705 --> 00:39:50.913
There 's a fire at Cerinem Point.

481
00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:55.118
In a flat on the 1 6th floor,
you'll find cop number three.


482
00:39:55.213 --> 00:39:57.750
Oh, I used a new system.

483
00:39:57.840 --> 00:39:59.205
A new system?

484
00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:01.666
Can you be a bit clearer?

485
00:40:01.761 --> 00:40:03.752
I pulverized the fucker with a hammer.

486
00:40:03.846 --> 00:40:07.134
Is that clear enough for you?

487
00:40:09.602 --> 00:40:11.934
I pulverized the fucker with a hammer.

488
00:40:12.021 --> 00:40:13.306
Oh, yeah.

489
00:40:13.398 --> 00:40:15.764
Oh, shit.

490
00:40:15.858 --> 00:40:17.598
Yeah, I forgot. I got a name.

491
00:40:17.694 --> 00:40:19.810
A name?

492
00:40:19.904 --> 00:40:22.020
Is there an echo? Stop
repeating everything I say.


493
00:40:22.115 --> 00:40:23.355
It's getting on my fucking tits.

494
00:40:23.449 --> 00:40:24.814
I'm sorry.

495
00:40:24.909 --> 00:40:28.743
It's "Blitz" as in "Blitzkrieg."

496
00:40:28.830 --> 00:40:30.411
You got that?

497
00:40:30.498 --> 00:40:33.365
Yeah. That's good. Yeah.

498
00:40:35.336 --> 00:40:36.997
Oh, fuck.

499
00:41:20.006 --> 00:41:21.416
Sarge, you need to see this.

500
00:41:21.507 --> 00:41:23.873
It's the evening edition.

501
00:41:28.139 --> 00:41:29.379
Bastards!

502
00:41:35.146 --> 00:41:36.010
Where the hell have you been?

503
00:41:36.105 --> 00:41:37.470
Can't say.

504
00:41:37.607 --> 00:41:39.689
What do you mean you can't say?

505
00:41:39.776 --> 00:41:41.482
Can't account for my movements?

506
00:41:41.611 --> 00:41:43.192
Is that the correct lingo?

507
00:41:43.279 --> 00:41:45.645
You do know another
policeman�s been killed?


508
00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:47.150
Chief Inspector Roberts.

509
00:41:47.241 --> 00:41:49.277
What?

510
00:41:49.368 --> 00:41:51.905
The killer's targets
are in this station.


511
00:41:51.996 --> 00:41:54.783
He used a hammer to kill
Roberts and he torched his flat.


512
00:41:54.874 --> 00:41:56.990
He contacted some hack
journalist at The Post...


513
00:41:57.085 --> 00:42:00.043
called Dunlop. 
Gave him all the details.

514
00:42:00.129 --> 00:42:01.994
Dunlop you say?

515
00:42:02.090 --> 00:42:04.126
Yeah. Harold Dunlop. I
sent a team over there...


516
00:42:04.217 --> 00:42:06.424
to tap his phone and make
sure his calls are traced.


517
00:42:06.511 --> 00:42:07.671
Do you know him?

518
00:42:07.762 --> 00:42:09.343
I do.

519
00:42:12.350 --> 00:42:13.965
I'm Harold Dunlop from The Post.

520
00:42:14.060 --> 00:42:15.925
Hey! Get off!

521
00:42:16.020 --> 00:42:19.183
All right! All right! Bloody hell!

522
00:42:19.273 --> 00:42:20.479
What was all that about?

523
00:42:20.608 --> 00:42:22.473
I told you, I know him.

524
00:42:22.610 --> 00:42:25.147
Bastard put my picture in the paper.

525
00:43:06.737 --> 00:43:08.398
Click.

526
00:43:17.999 --> 00:43:19.705
Hello. Hello. Hello.

527
00:43:25.590 --> 00:43:27.205
Bang. Bang.

528
00:43:32.305 --> 00:43:34.762
Yippity-doo-dah-day.

529
00:43:42.356 --> 00:43:44.142
Hello? Dunlop.

530
00:43:44.233 --> 00:43:46.940
Is this Harold Dunlop?

531
00:43:47.028 --> 00:43:48.689
Yeah. Yeah.

532
00:43:48.779 --> 00:43:50.735
The Harold Dunlop? 
The crime reporter?

533
00:43:50.823 --> 00:43:51.812
Can you get me a latt�?

534
00:43:51.908 --> 00:43:53.819
Yeah. Who's this?

535
00:43:53.910 --> 00:43:57.494
Mr. Dunlop, how would you
like to nail The Blitz?


536
00:43:57.622 --> 00:43:59.863
Yeah, I 'd like that very much.

537
00:43:59.999 --> 00:44:04.618
Oh-ho! Is that it? Perhaps I didn't
make myself clear, Mr. Dunlop.


538
00:44:04.712 --> 00:44:06.828
I know the name of the cop killer.

539
00:44:06.923 --> 00:44:10.415
I think you're gonna have to work
a little bit harder than that.


540
00:44:10.509 --> 00:44:12.875
It'll be an honor to bring
that maniac to justice.


541
00:44:12.970 --> 00:44:14.335
Yeah. Yeah.

542
00:44:14.430 --> 00:44:16.341
Well, you'll have a little think...

543
00:44:16.432 --> 00:44:18.764
about how much you'd be willing to pay.

544
00:44:18.809 --> 00:44:21.095
Come now, Mr. Dunlop.

545
00:44:21.187 --> 00:44:24.725
You didn't think this was a
citizen doing his bit now, did you?


546
00:44:24.815 --> 00:44:25.975
How much do you want?

547
00:44:26.067 --> 00:44:28.103
50k. In cash.

548
00:44:28.194 --> 00:44:31.311
For that, you get the
name of The Blitz...


549
00:44:31.405 --> 00:44:33.236
plus extras.

550
00:44:33.324 --> 00:44:35.110
Extras? What do you mean extras?

551
00:44:35.201 --> 00:44:37.658
Various assorted items, Mr. Dunlop.

552
00:44:37.745 --> 00:44:41.158
You'll find out when I get my 50k.

553
00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:49.037
I'm the master of the fucking universe.

554
00:44:55.638 --> 00:44:57.048
Hello.

555
00:44:57.139 --> 00:44:59.425
Hey.

556
00:44:59.517 --> 00:45:04.807
The fire pretty much destroyed
anything around the body.


557
00:45:04.939 --> 00:45:08.431
We found that in the bathroom.
The fire wasn't so bad in there.


558
00:45:08.609 --> 00:45:11.772
But did the heat or water
damage any DNA or fingerprints?


559
00:45:11.862 --> 00:45:13.648
I'm afraid so.

560
00:45:18.411 --> 00:45:20.367
Peacock Gym.

561
00:45:20.454 --> 00:45:23.161
Yeah, looks like it.

562
00:45:23.291 --> 00:45:27.625
It's B rant. Check if DI Roberts
was ever a member of the Peacock Gym.


563
00:45:34.135 --> 00:45:36.091
What are you doing?

564
00:45:36.178 --> 00:45:38.214
I told you to wait
until you heard from me.


565
00:45:38.306 --> 00:45:40.092
Yeah, well, I didn't hear from you.

566
00:45:40.182 --> 00:45:41.843
Yeah. Well, I'm sorting it.

567
00:45:41.892 --> 00:45:44.474
Yeah? I'm trying to.

568
00:45:44.603 --> 00:45:46.810
Look, just go home.

569
00:46:07.793 --> 00:46:09.909
DI Stokes?

570
00:46:10.004 --> 00:46:11.414
You must be Falls.

571
00:46:11.505 --> 00:46:12.870
Yeah. Yeah.

572
00:46:12.965 --> 00:46:14.375
What'll you have?

573
00:46:14.467 --> 00:46:17.675
Tea, please, sir. Just tea.

574
00:46:17.762 --> 00:46:20.469
Forget the "sir" stuff. Craig'll do.

575
00:46:20.598 --> 00:46:21.929
Tea and toast for two!

576
00:46:22.016 --> 00:46:23.802
Coming up, love!

577
00:46:23.893 --> 00:46:26.430
Okay. Well, we've got two of the kids...

578
00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:28.431
involved in the assault of Mr. Azziz.

579
00:46:28.522 --> 00:46:29.682
I thought... He's not...?

580
00:46:29.774 --> 00:46:32.607
Dead? Incredibly, no.

581
00:46:32.693 --> 00:46:35.275
Let me see.

582
00:46:35.363 --> 00:46:38.230
John Wells, known as Metal.

583
00:46:38.324 --> 00:46:40.656
This the one you wanted to discuss?

584
00:46:40.743 --> 00:46:41.823
Yes.

585
00:46:41.911 --> 00:46:43.993
What is he? A snitch?

586
00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:46.036
Yeah, well, you know...

587
00:46:46.123 --> 00:46:49.707
and I try to look out for him.

588
00:46:49.794 --> 00:46:52.877
Thank you.

589
00:46:52.963 --> 00:46:55.830
He's a piece of shit.

590
00:46:55.925 --> 00:46:56.914
A thug.

591
00:46:57.009 --> 00:46:58.749
Oh, he's a boy.

592
00:46:58.844 --> 00:47:02.712
Underneath all that,
he's just a scared boy.


593
00:47:06.435 --> 00:47:08.721
So is there anything you can do?

594
00:47:08.813 --> 00:47:11.304
Anything can be buried.

595
00:47:11.399 --> 00:47:14.391
Will you?

596
00:47:14.485 --> 00:47:17.397
Meet me for a drink tonight.

597
00:47:18.906 --> 00:47:20.612
That's all?

598
00:47:30.042 --> 00:47:33.830
Hey, Roberts and the
Peacock Gym. Never a member.


599
00:47:33.921 --> 00:47:36.128
No, of course not.

600
00:47:36.215 --> 00:47:37.830
Have you got a minute?

601
00:47:37.925 --> 00:47:39.131
Yeah.

602
00:47:39.218 --> 00:47:41.129
Can you work that thing?

603
00:47:41.220 --> 00:47:43.256
Brant, you're such a dinosaur.

604
00:47:43.347 --> 00:47:47.056
I'm surprised you can even
work your own microwave.


605
00:47:47.143 --> 00:47:50.055
This is women's work. 
Just like typing.

606
00:47:50.146 --> 00:47:51.886
Right.

607
00:47:51.981 --> 00:47:53.642
So what are you looking for?

608
00:47:53.691 --> 00:47:56.649
Barry Weiss. It's the Belfront Towers.

609
00:47:56.735 --> 00:48:02.196
Kicked out of Peacock Gym.

610
00:48:02.283 --> 00:48:05.946
Oh, wow. This guy's always in trouble.

611
00:48:06.036 --> 00:48:10.700
He's been arrested more
times than you've had WPC's.


612
00:48:10.791 --> 00:48:12.247
You know I'm not like that.

613
00:48:12.334 --> 00:48:14.165
Right.

614
00:48:14.253 --> 00:48:17.996
It's petty stuff,
though. What do you think?


615
00:48:18.090 --> 00:48:20.627
No, nothing major.

616
00:48:20.718 --> 00:48:21.958
None of that yet.

617
00:48:27.349 --> 00:48:29.089
Have you got my money?

618
00:48:29.185 --> 00:48:31.426
Yeah. I just had
to pull a few strings.

619
00:48:31.604 --> 00:48:35.517
Pick me up outside
Weymouth Street car park.


620
00:48:49.121 --> 00:48:50.611
Stand there.

621
00:48:50.706 --> 00:48:51.786
All right.

622
00:48:51.874 --> 00:48:54.331
There. Steady. There.

623
00:48:54.418 --> 00:48:56.784
Oh, Jesus.

624
00:49:07.806 --> 00:49:10.764
Click.

625
00:49:19.485 --> 00:49:22.227
These are the extras
I was talking about.


626
00:49:22.321 --> 00:49:25.484
Trophies, I believe is the correct term.

627
00:49:25.574 --> 00:49:27.815
And you know who these belong to, eh?

628
00:49:27.910 --> 00:49:30.367
Correct.

629
00:49:34.124 --> 00:49:35.955
Right, I showed you mine.

630
00:49:36.043 --> 00:49:38.830
Perhaps we could have a
little look at yours now.


631
00:50:05.072 --> 00:50:07.814
All right.

632
00:50:07.908 --> 00:50:09.694
Aw.

633
00:50:09.785 --> 00:50:10.991
What?

634
00:50:11.078 --> 00:50:12.318
That's not fifty grand.

635
00:50:12.371 --> 00:50:13.861
Of course it's fifty grand.

636
00:50:13.956 --> 00:50:15.321
There's no way that's fifty grand.

637
00:50:15.416 --> 00:50:16.906
When did you last see fifty grand?

638
00:50:17.001 --> 00:50:18.662
Don't you trust me? 
Go and count it.

639
00:50:18.752 --> 00:50:19.832
It's about 500 quid.

640
00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:21.251
Oh. Go on, then.

641
00:50:21.338 --> 00:50:24.000
I'm gonna count every bit of it.

642
00:50:24.049 --> 00:50:26.586
Good. Buy yourself a new suit.

643
00:50:32.016 --> 00:50:34.758
Fifty, fifty, fifty, fifty, fifty.

644
00:50:34.810 --> 00:50:39.804
You are a fucking genius.

645
00:50:50.576 --> 00:50:52.362
I haven't told him your name yet.

646
00:50:52.411 --> 00:50:55.448
Relax. I'm not gonna hurt you.

647
00:50:55.581 --> 00:50:59.995
I only do police. Remember?

648
00:51:00.085 --> 00:51:02.201
How'd you get on to me?

649
00:51:02.296 --> 00:51:07.586
I got your address
from the Peacock Gym...


650
00:51:07.676 --> 00:51:11.715
and I went through your rubbish.

651
00:51:11.805 --> 00:51:15.047
I found the receipt
for the parking garage.


652
00:51:15.142 --> 00:51:16.928
That's very impressive.

653
00:51:17.019 --> 00:51:20.136
I haven't told him your name yet.

654
00:51:23.692 --> 00:51:25.353
I haven't told him your name.

655
00:51:25.444 --> 00:51:28.060
But you're gonna have
to help me out, see?


656
00:51:28.155 --> 00:51:29.691
Ah.

657
00:51:29.782 --> 00:51:32.694
I haven't told him your name yet.

658
00:51:32.785 --> 00:51:34.992
This is a bit of a tight squeeze.

659
00:51:37.247 --> 00:51:40.284
I haven't told him your name yet.

660
00:51:40.376 --> 00:51:41.866
No, no, no.

661
00:52:23.502 --> 00:52:25.493
A double Irish.

662
00:52:25.629 --> 00:52:28.291
Can't do, buddy. I'm closed.

663
00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:35.837
Listen up. I'm only gonna say
this once. I ain't your 'buddy.'


664
00:52:35.889 --> 00:52:39.097
When I ask for a drink, you
say, "Ice with that, sir?"


665
00:52:39.184 --> 00:52:41.721
Now let's begin again. 
A double Irish.

666
00:52:46.233 --> 00:52:48.394
You want ice with that, sir?

667
00:52:48.485 --> 00:52:51.568
Don't be ridiculous. 
Who needs ice?

668
00:52:54.700 --> 00:52:57.908
That�ll be five quid, sir.

669
00:52:57.995 --> 00:52:59.860
Like you said...

670
00:52:59.955 --> 00:53:02.571
you're closed.

671
00:53:02.708 --> 00:53:06.166
He went to the toilet.
When he hadn't come back...


672
00:53:06.211 --> 00:53:07.166
I got concerned. 
I thought he fell in.

673
00:53:07.212 --> 00:53:08.452
He did.

674
00:53:08.589 --> 00:53:10.204
Then what happened?

675
00:53:10.299 --> 00:53:12.790
Well, I went in there,
didn't l? I found him.


676
00:53:12.926 --> 00:53:16.168
Well, you didn't exactly come rushing
out though, did you, Mr. Dunlop?


677
00:53:16.263 --> 00:53:18.879
The man at the bar says you
was with him for ten minutes.


678
00:53:18.974 --> 00:53:21.681
Had you down as a couple
of George Michael fans.


679
00:53:21.769 --> 00:53:23.634
Hey, I was looking for the money.

680
00:53:23.729 --> 00:53:25.139
Money?

681
00:53:25.230 --> 00:53:26.766
The paper's money.

682
00:53:26.857 --> 00:53:28.063
We were paying him for an exclusive.

683
00:53:28.150 --> 00:53:30.186
Oh, for fuck's sake.

684
00:53:30.277 --> 00:53:31.687
Can I remind you that people...

685
00:53:31.779 --> 00:53:32.643
are being killed here, Mr. Dunlop?

686
00:53:32.738 --> 00:53:34.569
Ah, yeah?

687
00:53:34.656 --> 00:53:37.113
Yeah. Human beings, with
families and children.


688
00:53:37.201 --> 00:53:39.908
There's a car. Yeah. Oh, God, I forgot.

689
00:53:39.995 --> 00:53:43.203
Yeah. A car. You're not
gonna believe what's inside.


690
00:53:43.290 --> 00:53:45.155
Where is this car?

691
00:53:45.250 --> 00:53:47.662
Weymouth Street car
park. It's a black Jaguar.


692
00:53:47.753 --> 00:53:48.913
Bay 23!

693
00:53:52.132 --> 00:53:55.090
Oy! Am I gonna get police protection?

694
00:53:55.177 --> 00:53:56.713
Oh, yeah.

695
00:53:56.804 --> 00:53:59.796
We'll be all over you.

696
00:53:59.890 --> 00:54:02.427
Should've been the
other guy had him killed.


697
00:54:12.069 --> 00:54:13.650
What now?

698
00:54:21.787 --> 00:54:24.119
Murder inquiry. I want the
disc for the last month.


699
00:54:24.206 --> 00:54:25.491
Discs are full.

700
00:54:25.624 --> 00:54:27.364
What do you mean they�re full?

701
00:54:27.459 --> 00:54:29.996
They haven't recorded
anything for six weeks.


702
00:54:30.087 --> 00:54:32.203
It ran out of memory.
They'll fix it Monday.


703
00:54:32.297 --> 00:54:34.379
I don't believe this.

704
00:54:34.466 --> 00:54:37.833
The cameras are really
turned on. It's psychological.


705
00:54:37.928 --> 00:54:40.089
You don't give a shit, do ya?

706
00:54:40.180 --> 00:54:43.672
It's disgraceful.

707
00:54:43.767 --> 00:54:48.602
So is you eating it.

708
00:55:16.258 --> 00:55:17.794
Hey.

709
00:55:17.885 --> 00:55:19.967
You look nice.

710
00:55:20.053 --> 00:55:21.213
Thanks.

711
00:55:21.305 --> 00:55:22.465
Can I take your coat?

712
00:55:22.598 --> 00:55:24.213
Yeah.

713
00:55:28.604 --> 00:55:30.435
Thank you.

714
00:55:30.522 --> 00:55:32.228
Have a seat.

715
00:55:58.592 --> 00:56:00.128
You've gone quiet.

716
00:56:00.218 --> 00:56:03.085
I like listening to you.

717
00:56:27.079 --> 00:56:28.660
Everything all right?

718
00:56:28.747 --> 00:56:30.612
There's got to be an
easier way to do this.


719
00:56:30.707 --> 00:56:32.413
Fuck, Brant.

720
00:56:32.501 --> 00:56:34.617
So how does it feel to
actually need us girls...


721
00:56:34.753 --> 00:56:39.087
for more than just cooking
and cleaning and shagging?


722
00:56:39.174 --> 00:56:43.884
I was sorting a way of listing
all Weiss' arresting officers.


723
00:56:43.971 --> 00:56:47.179
I've seemed to pull up the
first one. It's WPC Sandra Bates.


724
00:56:49.643 --> 00:56:50.849
You're kidding.

725
00:56:55.732 --> 00:56:57.893
I've had a really nice time.

726
00:56:57.985 --> 00:56:59.316
Yeah.

727
00:57:04.032 --> 00:57:06.398
I'll call you.

728
00:57:10.163 --> 00:57:13.121
When?

729
00:57:13.208 --> 00:57:16.700
When are you gonna call me?

730
00:57:16.795 --> 00:57:18.581
Tomorrow.

731
00:57:18.672 --> 00:57:20.503
I'll tell you what.
How about this summer...


732
00:57:20.632 --> 00:57:23.294
we'll do a picnic?

733
00:57:23.385 --> 00:57:27.424
Don't you think I know how this goes?

734
00:57:27.514 --> 00:57:29.505
Man says, "I'll call you"...

735
00:57:29.641 --> 00:57:31.802
and a woman's waiting and hoping.

736
00:57:31.893 --> 00:57:33.975
She's a slave to her mobile...

737
00:57:34.062 --> 00:57:36.724
while he's thinking,
"Well, I'll call her...


738
00:57:36.815 --> 00:57:41.730
tomorrow, some day, Monday. Doesn't
matter. Well, here's a hint, yeah?


739
00:57:41.820 --> 00:57:44.778
It matters. It matters a lot.

740
00:57:44.865 --> 00:57:46.901
Tomorrow. I'll call you tomorrow.

741
00:57:46.992 --> 00:57:48.448
No, fuck off.

742
00:57:48.577 --> 00:57:49.441
Hey!

743
00:57:59.421 --> 00:58:01.912
Jesus. Look who else.

744
00:58:15.187 --> 00:58:17.599
Fuck. That's Roberts.

745
00:58:17.689 --> 00:58:18.974
And Falls.

746
00:58:20.901 --> 00:58:23.563
Shit. How could l be that stupid?

747
00:58:23.653 --> 00:58:27.737
Send an armed response unit
round to her flat straight away.


748
00:58:27.824 --> 00:58:29.189
It's a 1 9.

749
00:58:29.284 --> 00:58:31.650
Come on, Falls. We're coming.

750
00:58:31.745 --> 00:58:34.202
Oh.

751
00:58:34.289 --> 00:58:35.995
Oh, shit.

752
00:58:36.083 --> 00:58:40.292
I'm stupid. I'm stupid.

753
00:58:50.764 --> 00:58:52.129
What the fuck?

754
00:58:52.224 --> 00:58:53.304
What the fuck?

755
00:58:56.520 --> 00:58:57.760
Ugh!

756
00:59:03.610 --> 00:59:04.895
Not...

757
00:59:46.444 --> 00:59:49.732
Doctors have given her a sedative.
She should be out for a while.


758
00:59:49.823 --> 00:59:51.654
Did she get a look at the attacker?

759
00:59:51.741 --> 00:59:54.278
All she could say for sure
is that he's big and white.


760
00:59:54.369 --> 00:59:56.200
Big and white.

761
00:59:56.288 --> 00:59:59.405
So it's not the black kid
from Different Strokes.


762
00:59:59.499 --> 01:00:02.662
It's Barry Weiss. I know him.

763
01:00:02.752 --> 01:00:05.209
Should you be taking her booze?

764
01:00:05.297 --> 01:00:07.379
Well, she won't notice.

765
01:00:07.465 --> 01:00:08.705
Want one?

766
01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:10.665
Yeah.

767
01:00:12.971 --> 01:00:15.929
Is she all right?

768
01:00:16.016 --> 01:00:17.972
Who are you?

769
01:00:18.059 --> 01:00:19.720
DI Craig Stokes.

770
01:00:19.769 --> 01:00:21.350
I heard someone got killed.

771
01:00:21.438 --> 01:00:22.974
It's not Falls.

772
01:00:23.064 --> 01:00:24.645
Cop killer took a run at her.

773
01:00:24.733 --> 01:00:26.394
Some kid jumped in, a hoodie.

774
01:00:26.484 --> 01:00:29.317
He got his ticket punched.

775
01:00:29.404 --> 01:00:31.611
Were you with Falls this evening?

776
01:00:31.698 --> 01:00:35.441
Yes. We went for a drink
and I dropped her off.


777
01:00:35.577 --> 01:00:37.363
You dropped her in it, you mean.

778
01:00:37.412 --> 01:00:41.746
Did it not occur to you
to walk her to the door?


779
01:00:41.833 --> 01:00:44.666
What agent.

780
01:00:50.050 --> 01:00:52.006
Taxi!

781
01:00:52.093 --> 01:00:56.632
Can you take me to Bayswater?

782
01:00:58.016 --> 01:00:59.426
It's gonna cost you, mate.

783
01:00:59.517 --> 01:01:00.973
Hey, Bronski Beat.

784
01:01:01.061 --> 01:01:02.801
Do I look like the kind of cunt...

785
01:01:02.896 --> 01:01:05.387
who thinks Bayswater is
just around the corner?


786
01:01:13.448 --> 01:01:15.860
Hey, stop here. 
Stop here, mate.

787
01:01:15.951 --> 01:01:18.658
There. Dean Court.

788
01:01:22.207 --> 01:01:23.788
All right.

789
01:01:23.875 --> 01:01:25.035
Yeah, all right.

790
01:01:25.126 --> 01:01:26.616
There you go. Keep it.

791
01:01:31.675 --> 01:01:35.463
1,000 pounds.

792
01:01:35.637 --> 01:01:40.677
And question two. We wanted to
know the post code for BIair Castle.


793
01:01:40.767 --> 01:01:43.224
Don't know how many of you
ever visited Blair Castle.


794
01:01:57.284 --> 01:01:59.400
Is he dead?

795
01:01:59.494 --> 01:02:02.861
What, the little skinhead?

796
01:02:02.956 --> 01:02:06.369
It was a doornail.

797
01:02:18.513 --> 01:02:21.220
What's the story with you and him?

798
01:02:21.308 --> 01:02:25.426
Him risking his life for ya.

799
01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:29.354
Oh, I've known him since he was twelve.

800
01:02:29.441 --> 01:02:33.935
He used to live next door.

801
01:02:34.070 --> 01:02:38.655
When I came out of rehab, he was the
only one around here I wanted to know.


802
01:02:38.742 --> 01:02:43.156
He made me tea.

803
01:02:43.246 --> 01:02:45.407
I don't know. I thought...

804
01:02:45.498 --> 01:02:47.739
I could help him.

805
01:02:47.834 --> 01:02:52.294
Oh, my God.

806
01:02:55.050 --> 01:02:57.837
Brant.

807
01:03:29.751 --> 01:03:31.833
He definitely did a bunk.

808
01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:33.456
Find anything?

809
01:03:33.588 --> 01:03:36.295
Nothing incriminating, no.

810
01:03:36.424 --> 01:03:40.417
Used to be a good looking
boy. He let himself go a bit.


811
01:03:42.889 --> 01:03:44.504
Let's go public with Weiss.

812
01:03:44.641 --> 01:03:46.131
Your call.

813
01:03:46.226 --> 01:03:48.933
At least we'll flush the fucker out.

814
01:03:52.607 --> 01:03:54.814
Police today released a
picture of the suspect...


815
01:03:54.901 --> 01:03:57.438
they would like to question
regarding The Blitz.


816
01:03:57.529 --> 01:03:59.986
Yeah! I know him!

817
01:04:00.073 --> 01:04:03.406
I dropped the guy off.
He was fucking psycho.


818
01:04:14.379 --> 01:04:15.915
Long time, no see.

819
01:04:16.005 --> 01:04:17.290
Hey.

820
01:04:17.382 --> 01:04:20.215
Jack, this is Detective Brant.

821
01:04:20.301 --> 01:04:21.416
Hello, mate.

822
01:04:21.511 --> 01:04:22.671
Where's our boy?

823
01:04:22.762 --> 01:04:24.343
Room 7.

824
01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:34.725
Go, go, go.

825
01:04:42.323 --> 01:04:44.609
Fuck!

826
01:04:44.701 --> 01:04:47.067
He's on the move.

827
01:04:47.162 --> 01:04:48.777
Let's go.

828
01:05:28.703 --> 01:05:31.285
Ugh.

829
01:05:31.331 --> 01:05:35.040
We have him on the Great Western Road.

830
01:05:35.168 --> 01:05:38.581
Head down to Harrow Road. We
'Il put him off at the underpass.


831
01:06:13.665 --> 01:06:15.781
Now running west on the Westway.

832
01:06:23.967 --> 01:06:26.754
Heading towards Paddington.

833
01:06:33.351 --> 01:06:35.137
Suspect entering train depot...

834
01:06:35.228 --> 01:06:37.310
north of Paddington.
Brant still in pursuit.


835
01:06:39.315 --> 01:06:40.475
All units head for train depot...

836
01:06:40.608 --> 01:06:42.519
north of Paddington.

837
01:06:42.610 --> 01:06:46.228
Do not let B rant engage.
Repeat. Do not let Brant engage.


838
01:07:45.882 --> 01:07:47.588
What the fuck...

839
01:07:47.675 --> 01:07:49.461
Leave it, Brant.

840
01:07:49.594 --> 01:07:51.926
Brant, calm down. 
We've got him.

841
01:07:52.013 --> 01:07:53.298
Get the fuck...

842
01:07:53.389 --> 01:07:55.254
Fuck!

843
01:07:55.350 --> 01:07:57.432
Get this piece of shit out of here.

844
01:07:57.518 --> 01:07:58.883
Just calm down. Calm down.

845
01:07:58.978 --> 01:08:00.969
Move! Now!

846
01:08:01.064 --> 01:08:02.645
We've got him.

847
01:08:02.690 --> 01:08:05.147
We've got him, okay? 
We've got him.

848
01:08:15.787 --> 01:08:18.449
The Metropolitan Police
have just confirmed...


849
01:08:18.581 --> 01:08:21.664
the arrest of Barry Weiss, the prime
suspect in The Blitz killings...


850
01:08:21.793 --> 01:08:25.206
in which three London Police officers
were murdered in cold blood...


851
01:08:25.296 --> 01:08:28.163
after a dramatic chase
through West London...


852
01:08:29.884 --> 01:08:32.170
A t the Paddington train depot.

853
01:08:32.261 --> 01:08:35.128
Police are refusing to
comment any further...


854
01:08:44.023 --> 01:08:46.355
Just selling records, yeah?

855
01:09:29.152 --> 01:09:31.643
We're going to record this. Okay, Barry?

856
01:09:39.412 --> 01:09:43.371
I want a lawyer and a sandwich.

857
01:09:43.458 --> 01:09:47.918
Oh, and I want to update
my Facebook status.


858
01:09:48.004 --> 01:09:49.960
You have exactly forty-eight hours.

859
01:09:50.047 --> 01:09:53.915
In that time, you either
charge my client or release him.


860
01:10:00.391 --> 01:10:06.387
And he'd like a different sandwich.
He says the bread is stale.


861
01:10:06.481 --> 01:10:09.314
Weiss might be crazy
but he's not stupid.


862
01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:11.436
He's covered his tracks.

863
01:10:11.527 --> 01:10:14.485
The fire at Roberts' flat
destroyed any forensic evidence...


864
01:10:14.572 --> 01:10:17.439
we might have had. Even the
Peacock Gym link is tenuous.


865
01:10:17.492 --> 01:10:20.029
Well, he's admitted
the Jag belongs to him.


866
01:10:20.119 --> 01:10:22.360
It's been sitting in a car
park for at least six months.


867
01:10:22.455 --> 01:10:25.242
Anyone could've had access
to it. There's no CCTT.


868
01:10:25.333 --> 01:10:29.952
I got ahold of the guy with the dogs,
the one that saw the first murder.


869
01:10:30.046 --> 01:10:32.958
Now he's saying he can't
make a positive I D.


870
01:10:33.090 --> 01:10:36.457
All right, de 's too scared. Same
goes for the barman at the Wellesley.


871
01:10:36.594 --> 01:10:38.255
You didn't find anything at the hotel?

872
01:10:38.346 --> 01:10:39.426
Nothing.

873
01:10:39.514 --> 01:10:40.879
What about Forensics?

874
01:10:40.932 --> 01:10:43.298
Team stripped it down, but no.

875
01:10:43.392 --> 01:10:45.849
With what we've got, he'll be out
tomorrow laughing his head off.


876
01:10:45.937 --> 01:10:47.473
We need something solid.

877
01:10:47.605 --> 01:10:49.687
We'd better come up
with something quick.


878
01:10:49.732 --> 01:10:53.020
Otherwise, the killer is gonna
hop, skip and jump out of here.


879
01:10:53.110 --> 01:10:55.817
The only thing he's
getting so far is a caution.


880
01:11:19.011 --> 01:11:20.967
All right, Babe?

881
01:11:21.055 --> 01:11:25.424
Yeah. Yeah, no. 
I've been away, but...

882
01:11:25.518 --> 01:11:27.804
I'm back now.

883
01:11:27.895 --> 01:11:30.386
Do you want to come to my party?

884
01:11:30.481 --> 01:11:34.770
Yeah, like old times.

885
01:11:34.861 --> 01:11:37.819
Can you take care of me?

886
01:11:37.905 --> 01:11:39.816
Sweet.

887
01:11:44.203 --> 01:11:45.488
What's this?

888
01:11:45.621 --> 01:11:48.328
Moonshine. Irish moonshine.

889
01:11:48.416 --> 01:11:49.826
Isn't this stuff illegal?

890
01:11:49.917 --> 01:11:52.124
I fucking hope so.

891
01:11:52.169 --> 01:11:54.660
You drink this poison and then
you wonder why you get blackouts.


892
01:11:54.755 --> 01:11:57.417
I drink this poison
because I get blackouts.


893
01:11:57.508 --> 01:11:58.714
Sl�inte.

894
01:11:58.801 --> 01:12:00.166
Cheers.

895
01:12:05.933 --> 01:12:09.517
Say we can't prove anything.
Say Barry Weiss walks.


896
01:12:09.645 --> 01:12:11.601
Where are you going with this?

897
01:12:11.689 --> 01:12:14.522
Well, you told me once
before about some pedophile.


898
01:12:14.650 --> 01:12:18.768
You couldn't get the bastard
through the regular channels, so...


899
01:12:18.863 --> 01:12:21.479
you took him out yourself.

900
01:12:21.574 --> 01:12:25.237
I thought you were asleep
when I told you that.


901
01:12:25.328 --> 01:12:28.320
I'm not gonna continue
this line of talk.


902
01:12:28.372 --> 01:12:31.079
I don't like where it's going.

903
01:12:46.599 --> 01:12:49.466
Been a busy couple of
days for you, Barry.


904
01:12:49.602 --> 01:12:53.311
Took a ride in a police car.
Got your picture in the paper.


905
01:12:53.397 --> 01:12:57.185
Highlight of your career.

906
01:12:57.276 --> 01:13:00.939
You know, Barry, if you were smart...

907
01:13:01.030 --> 01:13:03.612
which I know you're not...

908
01:13:03.699 --> 01:13:06.486
you'd admit to what you did...

909
01:13:06.661 --> 01:13:10.870
because I'm gonna tell you now, you'll
be a lot safer in here than out there.


910
01:13:10.957 --> 01:13:13.619
Were they friends of yours...

911
01:13:13.709 --> 01:13:16.451
those cops that got killed?

912
01:13:22.009 --> 01:13:25.797
You see...

913
01:13:25.888 --> 01:13:29.221
I know what this is about, Barry.

914
01:13:33.479 --> 01:13:37.392
What did those lads
ever do to you, Barry?


915
01:13:37.483 --> 01:13:41.396
Of course, you knew. 
How did you react?

916
01:13:41.487 --> 01:13:43.978
Fuck you, pig.

917
01:13:44.073 --> 01:13:47.110
They call that resisting arrest.

918
01:13:47.201 --> 01:13:50.068
I call it stupid.

919
01:13:56.168 --> 01:13:58.750
I know I embarrassed you.

920
01:14:02.174 --> 01:14:03.664
Since then you've stewed...

921
01:14:03.759 --> 01:14:07.468
and cooked and simmered over it.

922
01:14:10.182 --> 01:14:14.801
You should've just let it go.

923
01:14:22.570 --> 01:14:25.152
Personally...

924
01:14:25.239 --> 01:14:30.359
I didn't remember until I saw you.
Didn't give it a second thought.


925
01:14:30.453 --> 01:14:34.492
It was so insignificant,
I forgot all about it.


926
01:14:34.623 --> 01:14:39.333
We sure all laughed when I played
the surveillance tapes at the station.


927
01:14:39.420 --> 01:14:44.289
We all did. But that stuff's silly.

928
01:14:47.970 --> 01:14:50.131
Sergeant Brant to you.

929
01:14:55.686 --> 01:14:58.177
The point is, Barry...

930
01:14:58.272 --> 01:15:01.014
you're nothing.

931
01:15:06.906 --> 01:15:09.443
No one cares.

932
01:15:09.575 --> 01:15:13.033
No one gives a fuck.

933
01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:18.622
Oh, and another thing.

934
01:15:18.709 --> 01:15:22.998
You, The Blitz.

935
01:15:23.089 --> 01:15:25.421
What the fuck is that?

936
01:16:24.984 --> 01:16:26.599
Don't mean to bomb you out, bro...

937
01:16:26.652 --> 01:16:28.188
but there's some major shit going down.

938
01:16:28.279 --> 01:16:29.735
I'm listening.

939
01:16:29.822 --> 01:16:31.358
A cop's ripped off a dealer.

940
01:16:31.448 --> 01:16:33.109
What?

941
01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:35.282
They're getting into the products, man.

942
01:16:35.369 --> 01:16:37.325
This dealer is like serious folks.

943
01:16:37.413 --> 01:16:41.747
You fuck with him and he gets
difficult, even with a woman.


944
01:16:41.834 --> 01:16:45.042
Whoa. Whoa. Back up a second.

945
01:16:45.129 --> 01:16:47.620
A female cop is ripping
off drug dealers?


946
01:16:47.715 --> 01:16:51.082
She a sister, too.

947
01:16:51.177 --> 01:16:52.838
This cop have a name?

948
01:16:52.928 --> 01:16:54.839
Yeah. Falls.

949
01:16:58.309 --> 01:17:01.767
Brant. It's Stokes.
Listen, I need your help.


950
01:17:09.111 --> 01:17:10.442
I think she's inside.

951
01:17:15.492 --> 01:17:18.734
You crashed a party, man.

952
01:17:18.829 --> 01:17:22.117
"You crashed a party?"
You fucking... Get him out!


953
01:17:22.208 --> 01:17:23.664
Come here.

954
01:17:33.469 --> 01:17:36.051
Do you like me? 
If you like me...

955
01:17:40.434 --> 01:17:41.970
Look at this shit.

956
01:17:42.061 --> 01:17:47.226
If you like me, you
can throw me a party.


957
01:17:48.859 --> 01:17:51.350
What are you doing? 
I don't wanna go!

958
01:17:51.445 --> 01:17:54.107
Go back. He's gonna kill me!

959
01:17:54.198 --> 01:17:57.440
He's gonna kill me!
No! He's gonna kill me!


960
01:17:57.576 --> 01:18:00.943
No!

961
01:18:01.038 --> 01:18:02.949
He's gonna kill me!

962
01:18:31.235 --> 01:18:32.691
What are these?

963
01:18:32.778 --> 01:18:35.565
Thanks. They�ll bring you down.

964
01:18:35.656 --> 01:18:38.819
The shower did that.

965
01:18:38.909 --> 01:18:42.072
Just take 'em, Falls.

966
01:18:53.090 --> 01:18:56.753
I'm messed up, aren't l?

967
01:18:59.388 --> 01:19:02.380
Even when I was working undercover...

968
01:19:02.474 --> 01:19:04.465
I was a cop
pretending to be a junkie.

969
01:19:04.601 --> 01:19:08.185
But really, I'm just a
junkie playing at being a cop.


970
01:19:11.442 --> 01:19:15.026
He's gonna get away with it, isn't he?

971
01:19:17.364 --> 01:19:20.231
If we can't protect our
own, what good are we, Brant?


972
01:19:23.245 --> 01:19:26.032
What good are we?

973
01:19:52.608 --> 01:19:54.690
A lot of press waiting?

974
01:19:54.818 --> 01:19:58.276
Yes, I'm afraid so. There's quiet
a crowd gathered outside the front.


975
01:19:58.364 --> 01:20:01.447
But we can leave through a
different exit, if you prefer.


976
01:20:01.492 --> 01:20:03.107
Fuck no!

977
01:20:03.202 --> 01:20:05.909
I hope it's all there.

978
01:20:18.592 --> 01:20:21.800
Is something on your mind, Barry?

979
01:20:21.887 --> 01:20:26.130
Well, I guess I'll see you another day.

980
01:20:26.225 --> 01:20:28.307
I can't wait.

981
01:21:01.427 --> 01:21:04.919
Don't worry. We're having
him tailed around the clock.


982
01:21:04.972 --> 01:21:06.837
Keep him out of trouble.

983
01:21:27.911 --> 01:21:31.153
We're in position now.
He's going into his flat.


984
01:21:55.397 --> 01:21:57.228
Is Brant still here?

985
01:21:57.316 --> 01:21:59.147
No. No, he left.

986
01:21:59.234 --> 01:22:01.316
It's Roberts' funeral this afternoon.

987
01:22:01.403 --> 01:22:03.940
Every cop in the Southeast
is gonna be there.


988
01:22:04.031 --> 01:22:05.862
Except you.

989
01:22:34.645 --> 01:22:37.887
In company with Christ
who died and now lives...


990
01:22:37.981 --> 01:22:39.812
may the rejoicing in Your Kingdom...

991
01:22:39.900 --> 01:22:42.642
where all our tears are wiped away...

992
01:22:42.736 --> 01:22:46.228
unite us together again in one family...

993
01:22:46.323 --> 01:22:48.860
to sing Your praise forever and ever.

994
01:22:48.951 --> 01:22:50.987
Amen.

995
01:22:55.874 --> 01:22:58.911
Eternal rest grant unto him, Oh, Lord...

996
01:22:59.002 --> 01:23:02.995
and let perpetual light shine upon him.

997
01:23:06.677 --> 01:23:09.714
into Your hand, 
Father of Mercy...

998
01:23:09.805 --> 01:23:13.798
we commend our brother in
sure and certain hope...


999
01:23:13.850 --> 01:23:16.387
that together, all who
have died in Christ...


1000
01:23:16.478 --> 01:23:19.595
will live with Him one day.

1001
01:23:19.690 --> 01:23:23.308
In nomine Patris, Filii
et Spiritu Sancti. Amen.


1002
01:23:32.995 --> 01:23:36.954
Beloved Bruce Roberts, we
give your body to the earth.


1003
01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:39.622
Earth Mother, Root Mother...

1004
01:23:39.710 --> 01:23:41.746
Father of soil.

1005
01:23:41.837 --> 01:23:46.331
We give You this body of
our beloved Bruce Roberts.


1006
01:23:46.425 --> 01:23:49.212
His eyes will never greet us again.

1007
01:23:49.303 --> 01:23:51.419
Return to earth.

1008
01:23:51.513 --> 01:23:54.220
We will not kiss these lops.

1009
01:23:54.308 --> 01:23:56.299
Return to earth.

1010
01:24:07.029 --> 01:24:09.691
What he has been is gone.

1011
01:24:09.781 --> 01:24:12.488
What he is now has passed the gate...

1012
01:24:12.659 --> 01:24:16.151
leaving his body to become soil.

1013
01:24:16.246 --> 01:24:18.737
This flesh to nurture flowers...

1014
01:24:18.832 --> 01:24:22.745
these bones to be roots of trees.

1015
01:25:15.347 --> 01:25:17.303
Come on.

1016
01:25:48.839 --> 01:25:51.296
Yeah, what's the latest?

1017
01:25:51.383 --> 01:25:53.795
Weiss hasn't left his flat all day.

1018
01:26:01.059 --> 01:26:02.390
Fuck.

1019
01:28:05.058 --> 01:28:08.266
Brant! Turn around, you fucker!

1020
01:28:08.353 --> 01:28:10.969
I wanna see your face
as your head explodes.


1021
01:28:18.488 --> 01:28:20.729
Ugh. Agh.

1022
01:28:25.495 --> 01:28:28.703
What? You think you fooled me?

1023
01:28:28.790 --> 01:28:33.454
No chance. I was just playing along.

1024
01:28:33.587 --> 01:28:34.747
Ugh!

1025
01:28:39.759 --> 01:28:41.875
Ugh!

1026
01:28:48.435 --> 01:28:50.426
Come on, Barry.

1027
01:28:50.520 --> 01:28:52.056
What are you gonna do?

1028
01:28:55.150 --> 01:28:57.687
Huh? Call the cops?

1029
01:29:10.206 --> 01:29:14.074
You stupid fucking pig.

1030
01:29:14.169 --> 01:29:17.832
Wait till the papers
get a load of this, hey.


1031
01:29:17.923 --> 01:29:19.914
I'm gonna sue you.

1032
01:29:20.008 --> 01:29:21.373
And you.

1033
01:29:21.468 --> 01:29:24.960
And all of you fucking pig cunts.

1034
01:29:25.055 --> 01:29:28.422
I'm gonna make fucking millions.

1035
01:29:31.186 --> 01:29:32.926
You fucking...

1036
01:29:33.021 --> 01:29:34.682
Brant?

1037
01:29:38.985 --> 01:29:41.067
You fuck.

1038
01:29:41.154 --> 01:29:43.486
You can't kill me.

1039
01:29:43.615 --> 01:29:46.402
I'm The Blitz.

1040
01:29:46.451 --> 01:29:49.113
Are you talking about that cop killer?

1041
01:29:49.204 --> 01:29:52.116
That can't be you, Barry.

1042
01:29:52.207 --> 01:29:55.620
We tried to convict you
but you were innocent.


1043
01:29:55.752 --> 01:29:59.916
The only thing we do know is he
was partial to people in uniform...


1044
01:30:00.006 --> 01:30:02.748
just like the one you're wearing.

1045
01:30:02.842 --> 01:30:06.710
And he used a
weapon just like this one.

1046
01:30:33.832 --> 01:30:36.869
Fucking lucky he didn't
shoot me in the head.


1047
01:30:50.849 --> 01:30:54.387
Something tells me this
one's gonna remain unsolved.


1048
01:30:59.399 --> 01:31:01.890
You're not supposed to smoke in here.

1049
01:31:01.985 --> 01:31:04.101
What you gonna do?

1050
01:31:04.195 --> 01:31:05.901
Shoot me?

1051
01:31:08.450 --> 01:31:12.068
I'm just leaving the
office now, darling.


1052
01:31:12.162 --> 01:31:14.904
Yeah, I'll be back at 7:00.
I love you too, Amanda. Yeah.


1053
01:31:16.666 --> 01:31:19.282
There he is. There's Brecky.

1054
01:31:19.377 --> 01:31:20.412
Fuck.

1055
01:31:20.503 --> 01:31:22.118
Bon app�tit.

1056
01:31:25.008 --> 01:31:26.919
Get out! Get away!
