[Elodie]
<i>There are many stories of chivalry</i>


2
00:00:25.018 --> 00:00:28.352
<i>where the heroic knight
saves the damsel in distress.</i>


3
00:00:30.018 --> 00:00:33.018
<i>This is not one of them.</i>

00:00:34.852 --> 00:00:36.477
[horses chuffing]

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.393
[tense music playing]

6
00:00:49.935 --> 00:00:52.518
[wings flapping]

7
00:01:05.727 --> 00:01:07.102
[King] There it is.

8
00:01:07.893 --> 00:01:09.352
Form up!

9
00:01:11.685 --> 00:01:13.435
Let's kill the beast.

10
00:01:13.518 --> 00:01:15.935
For glory! Hyah!

11
00:01:30.518 --> 00:01:31.518
Be on guard.

12
00:01:52.477 --> 00:01:55.977
[soft cracking]

13
00:02:00.143 --> 00:02:02.018
[dragon snarls]

14
00:02:02.102 --> 00:02:04.102
[swords clanging]

15
00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.435
[dragon roaring]

16
00:02:12.393 --> 00:02:13.393
Form the line!

17
00:02:21.602 --> 00:02:23.602
[soldiers breathing shakily]

18
00:02:25.143 --> 00:02:28.560
[dragon snarls, shrieks]

19
00:02:29.893 --> 00:02:31.643
[soldiers screaming]

20
00:02:45.018 --> 00:02:46.018
Hold!

21
00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:52.560
[wings flapping]

22
00:02:54.935 --> 00:02:57.352
[soldiers screaming]

00:03:07.102 --> 00:03:08.977
[dragon snarls]

24
00:03:25.227 --> 00:03:26.560
[panting]

25
00:03:32.602 --> 00:03:33.852
[grunts]

26
00:03:45.435 --> 00:03:46.810
[Floria] The last I could find.

27
00:03:47.393 --> 00:03:49.977
[Elodie] Did you take the tapestries
into town like Father asked?


28
00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:51.393
[Floria] This morning.

29
00:03:51.477 --> 00:03:54.602
We should take the furs too,
and the drapes.


30
00:03:54.685 --> 00:03:55.602
Not the drapes!

31
00:03:55.685 --> 00:03:57.977
You hate that pattern in your room anyway.

32
00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.685
They serve a purpose.

33
00:03:59.768 --> 00:04:02.602
Floria, our people are freezing.

34
00:04:02.685 --> 00:04:03.685
And starving.

35
00:04:05.352 --> 00:04:07.352
[carriage driver shouting indistinctly]

36
00:04:10.435 --> 00:04:11.852
Who'd come this far north?

37
00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.185
[Floria] Elodie, why are they leaving?

38
00:04:22.268 --> 00:04:24.393
[Elodie] There's nothing left
for them here, Floria.


39
00:04:28.852 --> 00:04:30.935
[man 1] I don't have enough.
Please, I'm hungry.


40
00:04:31.018 --> 00:04:32.477
[woman 1] For food, join the line!

41
00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.602
- [man 2] Keep to one side.
- [man 3] I'm starving.


42
00:04:35.143 --> 00:04:36.143
All right then.

43
00:04:37.393 --> 00:04:38.768
[man 4] Get off! It's mine!

44
00:04:38.852 --> 00:04:41.893
- Hey! Give me back my food.
- Get off of me, old man!


45
00:04:41.977 --> 00:04:43.060
You've had enough!

46
00:04:43.143 --> 00:04:45.352
[woman 2] Share this
with your sister. Go on.


47
00:04:45.435 --> 00:04:47.810
- Could you see who it was?
- [guard] A stranger, my lady.


48
00:04:47.893 --> 00:04:50.143
They may take
whatever wood they can carry.


49
00:04:50.227 --> 00:04:51.685
- I'll see to it.
- Come on, Flor.


50
00:04:51.768 --> 00:04:53.185
- [woman 2] Move on.
- [woman 3] Yes.


51
00:04:53.268 --> 00:04:54.727
- [man 5] Get in line.
- Give it to me.


52
00:04:55.393 --> 00:04:57.727
- [woman] I want to meet her first.
- Father?


53
00:05:01.935 --> 00:05:03.310
You must be Elodie.

54
00:05:03.893 --> 00:05:04.893
I am.

55
00:05:18.935 --> 00:05:19.935
She will do.

56
00:05:20.727 --> 00:05:22.352
[Lord Bayford sighs softly]

57
00:05:26.268 --> 00:05:29.602
- [Red Priestess] We await your decision.
- Thank you, Your Holiness.


58
00:05:31.393 --> 00:05:32.393
Please, this way.

59
00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.310
Father, what's happening?

60
00:05:38.393 --> 00:05:39.393
Who is that?

61
00:05:40.727 --> 00:05:42.143
[reading indistinctly]

62
00:05:42.227 --> 00:05:43.227
Stepmother?

63
00:05:45.768 --> 00:05:46.810
Well, what is it?

64
00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.352
[Lord Bayford] From the Queen of Aurea.

65
00:05:49.893 --> 00:05:51.227
[chuckles softly]

66
00:05:53.185 --> 00:05:54.185
A proposal.

67
00:05:54.268 --> 00:05:56.310
- Oh, my goodness.
- [Lord Bayford] Huh…


68
00:05:57.393 --> 00:05:59.560
- I have made a match.
- May I?


69
00:05:59.643 --> 00:06:00.852
[Lord Bayford] Uh-huh.

70
00:06:02.018 --> 00:06:03.102
He is a prince.

71
00:06:03.935 --> 00:06:04.935
A prince?

72
00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:08.935
I know you've always wished to travel,
as did your mother.


73
00:06:09.727 --> 00:06:12.185
Go. See the world.

74
00:06:12.268 --> 00:06:16.352
This man, he has a fleet of ships,
carriages full of gold.


75
00:06:16.935 --> 00:06:18.727
That's no reason to marry.

76
00:06:19.893 --> 00:06:21.102
We need this.

77
00:06:22.143 --> 00:06:23.977
Our stores are empty.

78
00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:26.102
We will not make it to the thaw.

79
00:06:28.268 --> 00:06:29.643
Your people need you.

80
00:06:31.352 --> 00:06:32.352
Hey.

81
00:06:34.977 --> 00:06:36.268
This is who we are.

82
00:06:48.685 --> 00:06:50.060
[sailor 1] Get to the port side.

83
00:06:50.685 --> 00:06:51.852
[sailor 2] Port side.

84
00:06:54.977 --> 00:06:57.143
[indistinct chatter]

85
00:06:57.227 --> 00:06:59.685
Elodie, what's the matter?

86
00:07:00.602 --> 00:07:01.602
Nothing.

87
00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:06.477
Father says it's natural to be nervous

88
00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.727
about meeting
your new husband and his family.


89
00:07:09.643 --> 00:07:10.852
They're strangers.

90
00:07:11.435 --> 00:07:15.060
I've never heard of the Kingdom of Aurea
until Father sprang this on me.


91
00:07:15.143 --> 00:07:16.310
[sailor 1] Mind the lines.

92
00:07:16.852 --> 00:07:17.852
Oh!

93
00:07:18.935 --> 00:07:22.393
Are you crazy?
What are you two doing up there?


94
00:07:22.977 --> 00:07:24.102
Come down here.

95
00:07:25.102 --> 00:07:26.227
Come on.

96
00:07:30.352 --> 00:07:32.893
This is how you
want your prince to meet you?


97
00:07:32.977 --> 00:07:35.018
Scared, cold as a corpse.

98
00:07:35.102 --> 00:07:37.268
Nose all drippy and wet.

99
00:07:37.352 --> 00:07:40.727
What have I been
telling you this entire trip?


100
00:07:41.227 --> 00:07:43.643
- [both] First impressions are everything.
- Hmm.


101
00:07:43.727 --> 00:07:45.060
[sailor 2] Come on, lift up.

102
00:07:45.143 --> 00:07:47.602
- [exhales sharply]
- [sailor blowing horn]


103
00:07:52.977 --> 00:07:54.185
[sailor 3] Look at that.

104
00:08:06.727 --> 00:08:08.810
I have good news, girls.

105
00:08:08.893 --> 00:08:12.143
The captain informs me
we approach Aurea's coastline.


106
00:08:13.352 --> 00:08:15.143
It should be any time now.

107
00:08:15.227 --> 00:08:17.393
[Lord and Lady Bayford chuckle]

108
00:08:25.102 --> 00:08:26.352
Father.

109
00:08:29.143 --> 00:08:30.935
What in the world?

110
00:08:33.602 --> 00:08:36.352
Looks almost… almost like a...

111
00:08:36.435 --> 00:08:37.518
A dragon.

112
00:08:48.268 --> 00:08:50.268
[horn bellowing]

113
00:08:57.518 --> 00:08:59.310
[horn bellowing continues]

114
00:09:07.185 --> 00:09:09.352
- It's okay.
- [Lady Bayford chuckles]


115
00:09:13.435 --> 00:09:15.435
[ethereal music playing]

116
00:09:30.935 --> 00:09:33.102
[breathes deeply]

117
00:09:48.727 --> 00:09:51.768
Oh, my heavens. [chuckles]

118
00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:27.310
[gasps]

119
00:10:35.852 --> 00:10:37.018
It's magnificent.

120
00:10:37.768 --> 00:10:40.560
My lords, my ladies,

121
00:10:40.643 --> 00:10:43.185
be welcome to the Kingdom of Aurea.

122
00:10:43.727 --> 00:10:46.018
The royal family is at prayer,

123
00:10:46.102 --> 00:10:48.268
but word has been sent of your arrival.

124
00:10:48.352 --> 00:10:51.102
In the meantime,
your rooms have been made ready.


125
00:10:51.727 --> 00:10:53.060
If you will follow me.

126
00:10:55.268 --> 00:10:56.393
[Floria] Is this a dream?

127
00:10:57.310 --> 00:11:00.352
If so, can I move
in and never wake up?

128
00:11:00.435 --> 00:11:01.893
[Lady Bayford shushes]

129
00:11:01.977 --> 00:11:04.977
If you want these people
to think we belong here,


130
00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:08.227
you can't act so easily impressed.

131
00:11:08.727 --> 00:11:11.060
What do you think, Ellie? Hmm?

132
00:11:11.143 --> 00:11:14.143
I think I had
a rather limited definition of wealthy.


133
00:11:14.685 --> 00:11:16.685
[birds chirping]

134
00:11:35.477 --> 00:11:38.518
[chamberlain]
I pray this is to your liking, my lady.


135
00:11:39.602 --> 00:11:41.185
A bath has been drawn

136
00:11:41.977 --> 00:11:43.977
and supper has been carried hence.

137
00:11:45.852 --> 00:11:48.602
At first light,
I shall return to convey you


138
00:11:49.143 --> 00:11:50.727
to meet His Royal Highness.

139
00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:53.310
Henry, Prince of Aurea.

140
00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:55.227
[chuckles softly]

141
00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:57.518
[Lady Bayford] Floria,
stop touching everything.


142
00:12:00.643 --> 00:12:01.852
Is something wrong?

143
00:12:02.768 --> 00:12:05.310
- I just hope he's kind.
- Hmm.


144
00:12:05.393 --> 00:12:06.560
- And well-read.
- Yeah.


145
00:12:07.143 --> 00:12:08.143
Handsome.

146
00:12:10.602 --> 00:12:13.393
Let's all give Elodie some privacy.

147
00:12:13.477 --> 00:12:16.768
She can use the time
to settle in, as we all could.


148
00:12:16.852 --> 00:12:18.060
Oh, indeed.

149
00:12:18.977 --> 00:12:19.977
Come.

150
00:12:47.685 --> 00:12:49.685
[birds chirping]

151
00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:16.435
[maid] M'lady.

152
00:13:17.352 --> 00:13:18.727
Everyone's waiting.

153
00:13:39.018 --> 00:13:40.643
[wind whistling outside]

154
00:13:58.268 --> 00:13:59.268
[sighs]

155
00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:32.560
Ellie?

156
00:14:35.227 --> 00:14:36.685
I can't sleep.

157
00:14:41.935 --> 00:14:44.435
I still can't believe
you're going to live here from now on.


158
00:14:45.268 --> 00:14:46.477
You and me both.

159
00:14:47.768 --> 00:14:50.185
I keep thinking,
if only Mother were alive,


160
00:14:51.268 --> 00:14:53.643
I could just
talk to her about all of this.


161
00:14:55.352 --> 00:14:57.227
Perhaps you could talk to Stepmother.

162
00:14:58.143 --> 00:15:01.393
She means well, even
if she is a bit…

163
00:15:01.477 --> 00:15:04.185
- Exhausting?
- [chuckles]


164
00:15:06.393 --> 00:15:09.393
It'll be fine. You'll see.

165
00:15:10.810 --> 00:15:13.435
You're Elodie. 
You can do anything.

166
00:15:16.518 --> 00:15:18.518
[Queen Isabelle]
<i>What is your greatest strength?</i>


167
00:15:20.102 --> 00:15:22.060
[Elodie] I always tell the truth,
Your Majesty.


168
00:15:22.768 --> 00:15:25.768
[Queen Isabelle]
Some might call that a weakness.


169
00:15:26.935 --> 00:15:28.227
Do you know your heart?

170
00:15:28.977 --> 00:15:30.893
[Elodie] I believe I do, Your Majesty.

171
00:15:30.977 --> 00:15:33.102
[Queen Isabelle]
And what is it telling you now?


172
00:15:33.185 --> 00:15:37.185
In truth, it is beating too loudly for me
to hear much of anything, Your Majesty.


173
00:15:38.227 --> 00:15:39.685
[Queen Isabelle] Arise, Elodie.

174
00:15:47.977 --> 00:15:49.060
I'm Henry.

175
00:15:50.477 --> 00:15:52.477
Very pleased to finally meet you, my lady.

176
00:15:53.477 --> 00:15:54.477
We all are.

177
00:15:55.768 --> 00:15:58.102
My son understates our joy.

178
00:15:58.977 --> 00:16:00.185
And if I may say so,

179
00:16:00.768 --> 00:16:03.352
your father has understated your beauty.

180
00:16:03.935 --> 00:16:07.560
I've never known my father to understate
much of anything, Your Majesty.


181
00:16:07.643 --> 00:16:09.727
[chuckles] I see she arrives
with some wit.


182
00:16:09.810 --> 00:16:13.143
Should you want it or not, Your Majesty.

183
00:16:13.227 --> 00:16:14.685
And you must be Floria.

184
00:16:16.477 --> 00:16:19.727
It seems even a harsh clime
can grow the fairest flowers.


185
00:16:19.810 --> 00:16:21.643
I love your castle.

186
00:16:21.727 --> 00:16:24.102
I mean, I <i>really</i> love it.

187
00:16:24.185 --> 00:16:25.185
Like, a lot…

188
00:16:27.102 --> 00:16:28.102
Your Majesty.

189
00:16:28.518 --> 00:16:30.518
You are to make yourself at home, child.

190
00:16:30.602 --> 00:16:35.268
We elders have some trivial matters
like weddings to attend to.


191
00:16:35.352 --> 00:16:36.352
[Lord Bayford] Yes…

192
00:16:36.935 --> 00:16:40.352
Your correspondence
made mention of some particulars


193
00:16:40.435 --> 00:16:42.477
you wish to discuss in person.

194
00:16:42.977 --> 00:16:45.393
- The two of us can confer in private.
- Yes.


195
00:16:45.477 --> 00:16:47.685
It's nothing to bore
our young people with.


196
00:16:48.977 --> 00:16:51.018
They have a far more
important task at hand.


197
00:16:52.185 --> 00:16:54.018
They must get to know each other.

198
00:17:07.185 --> 00:17:09.185
[Henry] Do you have any questions of me?

199
00:17:10.852 --> 00:17:12.435
[Elodie] Questions of what subject?

200
00:17:13.018 --> 00:17:14.518
You may choose the subject.

201
00:17:17.393 --> 00:17:18.768
What do you think about me?

202
00:17:20.268 --> 00:17:21.268
Pardon?

203
00:17:22.393 --> 00:17:25.685
Well, you seem disinterested at best,
which is your prerogative,


204
00:17:25.768 --> 00:17:28.477
but I'd like to know if the person
I'm being guilted into marrying


205
00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:29.935
truly likes me or not.

206
00:17:31.143 --> 00:17:32.560
[scoffs lightly]

207
00:17:32.643 --> 00:17:35.602
If my attitude offends you,
I do apologize. It was not my intent.


208
00:17:38.893 --> 00:17:43.810
However, I was unaware that, um,
you were being guilted into anything.


209
00:17:46.102 --> 00:17:49.977
The land where I come from
is exactly how your mother explained.


210
00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:53.185
Harsh and barren.

211
00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:56.143
This union will save us.

212
00:17:56.227 --> 00:17:57.768
I've made my peace with it.

213
00:17:58.643 --> 00:18:02.060
My happiness is a small price to pay
for the future of my people.


214
00:18:05.852 --> 00:18:06.852
Is something wrong?

215
00:18:09.435 --> 00:18:10.435
It's just…

216
00:18:11.935 --> 00:18:15.810
In the letter you sent in advance
of your arrival, you sounded different.


217
00:18:15.893 --> 00:18:18.602
[chuckles] Different. In what way?

218
00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:20.685
Far more, um…

219
00:18:22.852 --> 00:18:23.852
flowery.

220
00:18:23.935 --> 00:18:25.560
[both laugh]

221
00:18:25.643 --> 00:18:29.518
Maybe that's because
my stepmother dictated most of it


222
00:18:29.602 --> 00:18:33.018
and my sister's idea was the heart…

223
00:18:33.727 --> 00:18:35.518
- The heart.
- Mmm.


224
00:18:35.602 --> 00:18:38.102
I thought it was
some sort of provincial insignia.


225
00:18:41.518 --> 00:18:42.768
You actually drew this?

226
00:18:42.852 --> 00:18:44.102
[chuckles]

227
00:18:46.393 --> 00:18:48.143
Hold on. It's a maze, isn't it?

228
00:18:48.227 --> 00:18:50.102
"I hope you'll get to know my heart."

229
00:18:50.185 --> 00:18:51.685
That is very clever.

230
00:18:53.643 --> 00:18:56.185
I used to make them
for Floria when she was little.


231
00:18:57.143 --> 00:18:59.643
- May I ask you another question?
- Certainly.


232
00:19:00.518 --> 00:19:02.393
Do they always follow you so closely?

233
00:19:04.685 --> 00:19:06.268
This is them giving me space.

234
00:19:07.893 --> 00:19:08.935
That must be tiring.

235
00:19:09.935 --> 00:19:11.518
It is, actually.

236
00:19:13.977 --> 00:19:17.602
I saw some horses
being left unattended at the stables.


237
00:19:21.518 --> 00:19:22.518
Do you ride?

238
00:19:24.393 --> 00:19:27.018
- [horses whinny]
- [riveting music playing]


239
00:19:39.643 --> 00:19:40.643
[Elodie] Hyah!

240
00:19:52.352 --> 00:19:55.477
- Where did you learn to ride like that?
- My mother.


241
00:19:56.685 --> 00:19:58.185
Which way now?

242
00:19:58.268 --> 00:20:00.352
Well, depends on what you want to see.

243
00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:02.310
Everything.

244
00:20:03.435 --> 00:20:04.643
Very well.

245
00:20:04.727 --> 00:20:05.810
[doors open]

246
00:20:20.435 --> 00:20:21.810
What happened in there?

247
00:20:24.018 --> 00:20:25.018
Speak already.

248
00:20:25.810 --> 00:20:28.227
- Is the wedding still on?
- Aye.


249
00:20:28.935 --> 00:20:31.643
You settled on a fair bride price?

250
00:20:31.727 --> 00:20:34.185
More gold than I could ever imagine.

251
00:20:34.268 --> 00:20:35.810
[Lady Bayford gasps softly]

252
00:20:38.685 --> 00:20:40.352
Then why do you look so?

253
00:20:40.435 --> 00:20:42.018
No, it's nothing. I'm fine.

254
00:20:44.018 --> 00:20:46.560
Tell me, you didn't say anything
to embarrass us.


255
00:20:46.643 --> 00:20:48.102
No, I did not.

256
00:20:48.185 --> 00:20:52.018
Because it's very important
that our two families get along.


257
00:20:52.102 --> 00:20:54.310
Not only for Elodie's sake, but for ours.

258
00:20:54.393 --> 00:20:56.935
I said, nothing! 
Nothing's wrong.

259
00:21:00.893 --> 00:21:04.393
I saw something,
high on the mountain last night.


260
00:21:05.018 --> 00:21:06.018
Torches.

261
00:21:07.935 --> 00:21:09.227
You saw that?

262
00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:10.477
I couldn't sleep.

263
00:21:12.768 --> 00:21:14.185
It was an ancient ceremony.

264
00:21:15.102 --> 00:21:17.060
Or rather, one of three.

265
00:21:17.685 --> 00:21:19.602
They're very significant to my family.

266
00:21:20.227 --> 00:21:22.310
For our whole kingdom, really. They, um…

267
00:21:23.977 --> 00:21:25.685
They honor our ancestors.

268
00:21:27.685 --> 00:21:30.393
That's why my mother
chose these dates for our wedding.


269
00:21:31.352 --> 00:21:32.768
[Elodie] It is quite beautiful.

270
00:21:33.685 --> 00:21:34.893
[Henry] Yes, I suppose.

271
00:21:35.977 --> 00:21:38.477
I really don't have
anything else to compare it to.


272
00:21:39.518 --> 00:21:41.185
May I confide in you something?

273
00:21:42.143 --> 00:21:43.143
Yes.

274
00:21:43.185 --> 00:21:45.852
My greatest wish is
to go see the world.

275
00:21:47.435 --> 00:21:50.643
Really set out and see it, you know?

276
00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:52.435
I do, actually.

277
00:21:53.643 --> 00:21:54.893
It's my life's dream.

278
00:21:57.393 --> 00:22:01.768
For as long as I can remember,
I've longed to explore the distant lands.


279
00:22:02.602 --> 00:22:04.268
The ones you only read about.

280
00:22:05.352 --> 00:22:06.560
[Elodie chuckles softly]

281
00:22:08.352 --> 00:22:10.227
Perhaps, one day, we will.

282
00:22:12.268 --> 00:22:13.352
Perhaps.

283
00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:23.560
[bell tolling]

284
00:22:27.435 --> 00:22:29.518
[woman] And the orange in this area.

285
00:22:33.185 --> 00:22:36.060
[Lady Bayford]
Everything's so beautiful, Your Majesty.


286
00:22:36.143 --> 00:22:37.727
Well, I'm glad you approve.

287
00:22:38.810 --> 00:22:40.185
Very elegant.

288
00:22:42.602 --> 00:22:44.810
You have impeccable taste.

289
00:22:45.810 --> 00:22:49.393
Everything is just so exquisite.

290
00:22:49.477 --> 00:22:52.227
I'm sorry, is there something
I can help you with?


291
00:22:52.893 --> 00:22:55.810
I just thought
we might become better acquainted,


292
00:22:56.518 --> 00:22:58.768
seeing as we're about to be family.

293
00:22:58.852 --> 00:23:02.393
Ah, this must be very exciting for you.

294
00:23:02.477 --> 00:23:05.477
Your father was a
rope maker, was he not?

295
00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:07.268
The finest in the city.

296
00:23:07.352 --> 00:23:10.018
And here you are. 
You've climbed so high.

297
00:23:11.102 --> 00:23:14.060
Still, one mustn't forget one's station.

298
00:23:14.977 --> 00:23:16.935
Nor place undue import

299
00:23:17.018 --> 00:23:20.768
on what is ultimately
a transaction born of necessity.


300
00:23:21.852 --> 00:23:24.060
Uh… "Necessity"?

301
00:23:24.643 --> 00:23:26.268
Well, your family needs money.

302
00:23:26.935 --> 00:23:28.518
My family needs a bride.

303
00:23:29.227 --> 00:23:31.852
What we don't need is more family.

304
00:23:33.352 --> 00:23:35.643
I wish all the
best for Henry and Eloise.

305
00:23:35.727 --> 00:23:37.060
- I merely...
- Elodie.


306
00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:38.560
Pardon?

307
00:23:40.352 --> 00:23:43.477
My stepdaughter. 
Her name is Elodie.

308
00:23:44.977 --> 00:23:46.060
That's what I said.

309
00:23:47.018 --> 00:23:48.352
Good day, Lady Bayford.

310
00:24:05.477 --> 00:24:06.477
It's perfect.

311
00:24:07.227 --> 00:24:08.893
Everything in here is so perfect.

312
00:24:13.185 --> 00:24:14.185
[Elodie] Stepmother.

313
00:24:15.935 --> 00:24:17.310
Is something the matter?

314
00:24:18.768 --> 00:24:19.768
Elodie,

315
00:24:20.810 --> 00:24:23.102
I know we haven't always been close,

316
00:24:23.810 --> 00:24:25.852
but I need you
to listen to me now.

317
00:24:26.602 --> 00:24:29.685
This wedding… is a mistake.

318
00:24:29.768 --> 00:24:30.768
[scoffs] What?

319
00:24:33.185 --> 00:24:34.518
I don't understand.

320
00:24:34.602 --> 00:24:37.018
These people, I don't trust them.

321
00:24:37.602 --> 00:24:41.102
It's hard to explain,
but a mother knows these things.


322
00:24:41.185 --> 00:24:43.310
Only yesterday,
you were enamored by this place.


323
00:24:43.393 --> 00:24:44.393
Floria.

324
00:24:44.435 --> 00:24:45.518
I was wrong.

325
00:24:46.685 --> 00:24:50.810
They may be royalty,
but that doesn't make them good people.


326
00:24:52.227 --> 00:24:53.227
[Elodie] Well…

327
00:24:54.185 --> 00:24:57.268
- What does Father think?
- He refuses to talk about it.


328
00:24:57.352 --> 00:25:01.518
And when I try to tell him my worries,
he snaps at me.


329
00:25:01.602 --> 00:25:04.310
- Because you're being unreasonable.
- That's enough, Flor.


330
00:25:04.893 --> 00:25:10.060
Elodie, I swear that I only want
what's best for you.


331
00:25:15.352 --> 00:25:17.060
Am I interrupting something?

332
00:25:18.768 --> 00:25:19.810
No.

333
00:25:20.727 --> 00:25:21.727
Just…

334
00:25:24.018 --> 00:25:25.060
girl talk.

335
00:25:26.227 --> 00:25:30.477
Well, tomorrow's a big day,
and these girls, they need their rest.


336
00:25:33.268 --> 00:25:36.185
Think about what I said.
There's still time.


337
00:25:36.768 --> 00:25:37.768
Time for what?

338
00:25:44.685 --> 00:25:47.102
[Lady Bayford] I hope you know
what you're doing.


339
00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:53.977
Good night, my angels.

340
00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:56.768
- Good night, Father.
- Good night, Father.


341
00:25:58.977 --> 00:25:59.977
Good night.

342
00:26:06.602 --> 00:26:08.602
[birds chirping]

343
00:26:12.643 --> 00:26:14.643

[Elodie sighs deeply]

348
00:27:34.268 --> 00:27:35.268
[Floria] Wow.

349
00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:38.060
[serene music playing]

350
00:28:10.977 --> 00:28:12.643
[priest] You may kiss the bride.

351
00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:33.518
I present my son and new daughter,
Elodie, Princess of Aurea.


352
00:28:33.602 --> 00:28:36.185
[guests applaud, cheer]

353
00:28:57.893 --> 00:28:59.227
Goodbye, Father.

354
00:29:22.185 --> 00:29:24.893
[softly] I hope I'm half as beautiful
someday as you are today.


355
00:29:26.893 --> 00:29:28.310
Twice as beautiful.

356
00:29:31.102 --> 00:29:33.352
- I love you.
- I love you.


357
00:29:49.268 --> 00:29:53.810
Hey! Hey, hey!

358
00:29:57.935 --> 00:29:59.185
[Elodie] Where are we going?

359
00:29:59.268 --> 00:30:02.477
[Henry] Remember I told you about those
ancient ceremonies up on the mountain?


360
00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:03.393
[Elodie] Yes.

361
00:30:03.477 --> 00:30:06.393
[Henry] We're going to pay homage
to my ancestors.


362
00:30:13.352 --> 00:30:15.643
[wind whistles]

363
00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:01.727
Welcome, Princess.

364
00:31:02.602 --> 00:31:06.143
For generations,
it has been our task, our duty,


365
00:31:07.018 --> 00:31:08.560
to protect our people.

366
00:31:09.810 --> 00:31:13.143
The price is dear,
but so too the reward.

367
00:31:14.352 --> 00:31:15.518
So, tonight,

368
00:31:16.893 --> 00:31:22.102
you join a long line of women
who have helped to build this kingdom.


369
00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:29.018
When our ancestors
first lay claim to this island,


370
00:31:29.810 --> 00:31:32.268
they found they were not
its sole inhabitants.


371
00:31:33.227 --> 00:31:35.518
A creature dwelt here first.

372
00:31:36.477 --> 00:31:38.143
The last of its kind.

373
00:31:39.268 --> 00:31:41.268
With savage bloodlust,

374
00:31:41.352 --> 00:31:44.810
the beast left its lair
and set upon the village.


375
00:31:46.102 --> 00:31:50.227
So the king gathered his soldiers
to avenge his people.


376
00:31:50.977 --> 00:31:53.435
But their steel
was no match for the monster,


377
00:31:54.393 --> 00:31:56.852
and each man met his end.

378
00:31:57.935 --> 00:32:00.102
Each save one.

379
00:32:01.018 --> 00:32:05.560
For the king,
the beast had a far worse fate in store.


380
00:32:06.393 --> 00:32:10.227
Give up his three beloved daughters
and the island could be shared.


381
00:32:11.268 --> 00:32:12.685
A cruel torture.

382
00:32:13.643 --> 00:32:14.852
He adored his daughters,

383
00:32:16.435 --> 00:32:19.102
but his duty to his subjects was stronger.

384
00:32:20.143 --> 00:32:22.560
And so, a pact was made.

385
00:32:22.643 --> 00:32:26.018
The three princesses met their end
in the belly of the beast,


386
00:32:26.102 --> 00:32:27.685
and a kingdom was born.

387
00:32:35.393 --> 00:32:38.977
It is this sacrifice
we commemorate every generation.


388
00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:41.477
A tradition going back centuries.

389
00:32:52.727 --> 00:32:54.143
Your hand, child.

390
00:33:02.185 --> 00:33:07.768
A legacy of honor and duty
you now inherit, Princess Elodie of Aurea.


391
00:33:20.435 --> 00:33:24.518
Let our two lines mingle
and fast become one.


392
00:33:25.977 --> 00:33:28.435
She is now of royal blood.

393
00:33:30.018 --> 00:33:31.852
[inhales sharply, exhales]

394
00:33:40.518 --> 00:33:43.643
To ensure that our kingdom
thrives forevermore,


395
00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:45.852
pay your due to the realm.

396
00:33:48.352 --> 00:33:50.268
[softly] Toss the coin into the chasm.

397
00:34:02.935 --> 00:34:05.102
The ceremony is now complete.

398
00:34:07.310 --> 00:34:08.977
You may make your return.

399
00:34:12.768 --> 00:34:14.643
I'm supposed to carry you back.

400
00:34:14.727 --> 00:34:16.727
I'm fine with walking, really.

401
00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:23.935
Floria would love this part.

402
00:34:25.935 --> 00:34:26.977
Close your eyes.

403
00:34:28.143 --> 00:34:29.185
I've got you.

404
00:34:45.602 --> 00:34:47.477
[Henry breathing shakily]

405
00:34:53.685 --> 00:34:54.685
[softly] I'm sorry.

406
00:35:01.518 --> 00:35:02.852
[Elodie screams] No!

407

Is anyone there?!

That's not mine.

427
00:37:34.060 --> 00:37:35.727
I am the sacrifice.

428
00:37:37.060 --> 00:37:38.643
I am the sacrifice?

Exciting.

What do you want?

456
00:41:49.977 --> 00:41:54.393
I want… what is promised.

457
00:41:57.060 --> 00:41:58.935
What is owed.

458
00:42:01.227 --> 00:42:07.102
Every generation, your kind must pay.

459

[softly] My kind?

You have to hide quickly.

We have both been lied to.

They said you set upon their village.

786

That the king came
only to defend his people.

He came unprovoked.

So, I will take their daughters
until my final breath.

We are not their daughters.

Every innocent woman
whose life was stolen down here.

Your kind were never innocent.

Then go ahead.

All of us did.

That is how they make us royal.

That is the blood you smell.

They fooled you.

You've been killing

01:36:37.143 --> 01:36:38.727
this commoner.

841
01:36:42.977 --> 01:36:44.643
Is she to be the third?

842
01:36:45.602 --> 01:36:47.102
Princess number three.

843
01:36:48.852 --> 01:36:52.310
She's the last,
and then I'll be free to marry whoever I...


844
01:36:52.393 --> 01:36:54.060
That's enough, Henry.

845
01:36:55.018 --> 01:36:57.435
You know nothing of what we've endured.

846
01:36:58.102 --> 01:37:00.352
You know nothing of our story.

847
01:37:08.685 --> 01:37:10.060
Take your family

848
01:37:11.893 --> 01:37:13.227
and run.

849
01:37:15.268 --> 01:37:16.602
[man] Come. Let's go.

850
01:37:18.435 --> 01:37:21.893
I will offer you all
one last chance to do the same.


851
01:37:29.393 --> 01:37:30.393
No?

852
01:37:32.310 --> 01:37:34.810
You insolent creature.

853
01:37:35.852 --> 01:37:37.602
You think we ought to fear you now?

854
01:37:39.018 --> 01:37:40.018
Why?

855
01:37:40.602 --> 01:37:43.810
Because you somehow
managed to escape the dragon?


856
01:37:47.602 --> 01:37:49.768
It's not me you should fear.

857
01:37:51.018 --> 01:37:54.352
This is the end of your story.

858
01:37:55.435 --> 01:37:56.435
[woman] Run!

859
01:38:10.810 --> 01:38:13.477
- [woman] It's the dragon!
- [man] Run!


860
01:38:14.227 --> 01:38:16.185
[roars]

861
01:38:36.185 --> 01:38:42.893
No!

862
01:39:29.018 --> 01:39:31.185
[sailor 1] Someone give me a hand
with this barrel.


863
01:39:31.268 --> 01:39:32.935
[sailor 2] Let's be sharp there, lads.

864
01:39:33.018 --> 01:39:35.185
[Lady Bayford] You can't be serious.

865
01:39:35.268 --> 01:39:36.143
[Elodie] But I am.

866
01:39:36.227 --> 01:39:37.977
We'll run it together.

867
01:39:38.060 --> 01:39:39.643
We've got a bounty of supplies.

868
01:39:39.727 --> 01:39:42.102
Enough to get us through
this freeze and the next.


869
01:39:42.185 --> 01:39:43.227
Oh, Elodie.

870
01:39:43.310 --> 01:39:46.518
You're the only person I trust
to look after our people, Mother.


871
01:39:55.393 --> 01:39:56.560
Can I help too?

872
01:39:59.852 --> 01:40:00.852
Floria.

873
01:40:01.227 --> 01:40:02.852
I'm counting on it.

874
01:40:12.060 --> 01:40:14.602
[Floria] Stepmother.
Stepmother, come and see this.


875
01:40:14.685 --> 01:40:16.268
[Lady Bayford] Oh, wide heavens!

876
01:40:16.352 --> 01:40:19.518
[sailor] My lady,
what course shall we steer?


877
01:40:21.810 --> 01:40:22.810
Home.

878
01:40:33.018 --> 01:40:35.185
