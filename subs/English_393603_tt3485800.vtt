You better get your traps
out of here, sonny.

These waters belong to us.

You don't own the ocean.

Oh, yeah?
This part of it, we do.

I know that subsidies
have gotten a bad name
in recent years,


32
00:03:20.603 --> 00:03:22.505
but this one is
vitally important


33
00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:25.508
to the economic fabric
and well-being
of this nation,


34
00:03:25.542 --> 00:03:28.678
and I need support of
this committee to do so.


35
00:03:28.711 --> 00:03:30.246
The President called me
this morning.


36
00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.749
He wants this subsidy
in the budget,


37
00:03:32.782 --> 00:03:34.684
demands that it be
in the budget.


38
00:03:34.717 --> 00:03:37.287
I'm afraid
that my good friend
Congressman Winship


39
00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.756
has no conception
of the practical
difficulties,


40
00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:41.591
eliminating it
from the federal budget.


41
00:03:41.624 --> 00:03:43.225
Sorry to hear that.

42
00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:44.961
After listening
to his testimony,
I deeply regret...


43
00:03:44.994 --> 00:03:46.128
What's the vote?

44
00:03:46.162 --> 00:03:47.864
The final passage
of the defense bill.

Hey.

00:03:56.306 --> 00:03:57.974
I'll call you
later, okay?


49
00:03:58.007 --> 00:04:00.710
Our PAC just voted
to endorse you, Charlie.


50
00:04:00.743 --> 00:04:04.246
Can't say it was easy
having to always the toe
the line for us,


51
00:04:04.281 --> 00:04:06.616
but I know you'll
be there next time.


52
00:04:06.649 --> 00:04:08.851
I'm bundling 20,000
for you next week.

00:04:08.885 --> 00:04:10.287
Yeah.

54
00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.255
Is that all
you have to say?

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.191
Well,
fuck you, buddy.


56

Come and get it.
Come on. Come on.

Yes! Yes.
Good shot.

Can't you guard
that old son of a bitch?

Take it easy.

wrong with you, Winship?

[ winces ]
Ooh.


65

You ought to be seeing
a chiropractor, son.


66

My back is incurable,
Harlan.

are at it again,

Uh-huh.
Hey, Harlan,


70
00:05:07.744 --> 00:05:08.945
what'd you
tell them?


71
00:05:08.978 --> 00:05:10.980
Never done drugs,
pure and simple.


72
00:05:11.013 --> 00:05:13.750
Of course, you bait
the trap with whiskey
and pussy,

00:05:13.783 --> 00:05:16.386
and they'll
catch me every time.

Ooh, that smells like
good sour mash to me.

You know I can
still hunt, Harlan.

Uh-huh. Yeah.

I don't know
if you, uh, saw her,

but there was
a woman upstairs


79
00:05:29.131 --> 00:05:32.402
taking pictures
of you up in
the visitors gallery.

That's illegal.

Yeah, I know.

00:05:35.738 --> 00:05:37.774
You sure it was me?

Charlie,
we have a problem.

Casey's hoping you'll
have time to stop by

00:06:06.336 --> 00:06:08.004
and finalize
the division of your
personal things.


95
00:06:08.037 --> 00:06:09.038
Her actual words were--

96
00:06:09.071 --> 00:06:10.340
Charlie,
this is serious, okay?


97
00:06:10.373 --> 00:06:12.041
You keep saying that,
and I'm still here.

Well, this time,
you've really done it.

Casey is
serious this time.
I mean very serious.

Okay, guys,
guys, what is it?


101
00:06:17.213 --> 00:06:18.348
What is it--
Casey has contacted--


102
00:06:18.381 --> 00:06:19.882
No, no, no, excuse me.
One second.


103
00:06:19.916 --> 00:06:21.318
The Pledge.

104
00:06:21.351 --> 00:06:23.052
Charlie, I have talked
to you about this.


105
00:06:23.085 --> 00:06:25.187
You don't stand up
for the Pledge of Alliance.


106
00:06:25.221 --> 00:06:26.923
You never even
mouth the words.


107
00:06:26.956 --> 00:06:28.257
So guess what happened
this morning?


108
00:06:28.291 --> 00:06:30.259
Someone took
a video of you


109
00:06:30.293 --> 00:06:32.295
with your feet
up on the Whip's desk


110
00:06:32.329 --> 00:06:34.831
while everyone else
is standing and
saluting the flag


111
00:06:34.864 --> 00:06:36.333
like the few
and the proud.


112
00:06:36.366 --> 00:06:38.267
Yeah. Well, as one of
the few and the proud,


113
00:06:38.301 --> 00:06:40.803
let me tell you
that none of us recited
the Pledge every morning


114
00:06:40.837 --> 00:06:42.739
when we were holding
Khe Sanh against
the communist hordes.


115
00:06:42.772 --> 00:06:44.741
Fine. You want
to play the cynical
Vietnam warrior,


116
00:06:44.774 --> 00:06:46.743
that's fine.
I like that card,


117
00:06:46.776 --> 00:06:49.446
but I'm telling you,
they care about this shit
back in the district.


118
00:06:49.479 --> 00:06:51.348
I am not gonna
recite a loyalty oath
every morning


119
00:06:51.381 --> 00:06:53.350
just to prove
that I love my country.


120
00:06:53.383 --> 00:06:55.852
Okay. Sure, yeah.
That's fine, Charlie,


121
00:06:55.885 --> 00:06:57.787
but they're already
calling you a Pledge dodger.


122
00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:59.989
Your congressional opponent,
Deidre Macavoy,


123
00:07:00.022 --> 00:07:02.492
has started a petition drive
to recall you


124
00:07:02.525 --> 00:07:04.761
and, if that's not enough,

125
00:07:04.794 --> 00:07:06.863
the Morality First
Foundation would love--


126
00:07:06.896 --> 00:07:08.865
Jared, Jared,
I can't be
recalled, okay?


127
00:07:08.898 --> 00:07:10.199
Here's
your weekend schedule.


128
00:07:10.232 --> 00:07:12.369
You have that visit
to Catatonk Island tomorrow.


129
00:07:12.402 --> 00:07:13.470
Charlie,
listen to me.


130
00:07:13.503 --> 00:07:15.338
What are you
talking about?


131
00:07:15.372 --> 00:07:17.407
Elected officials
are getting recalled
for breathing these days.


132
00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:18.908
They'd have
to vote me
out of office.


133
00:07:18.941 --> 00:07:20.142
Can't you reschedule
the trip--


134
00:07:20.176 --> 00:07:21.210
You've already
rescheduled three times,


135
00:07:21.243 --> 00:07:22.379
and you promised
to visit there.


136
00:07:22.412 --> 00:07:24.847
It's 18 miles out
in the Atlantic.


137
00:07:24.881 --> 00:07:27.884
20. You can almost see
Ireland from the cliffs.


138
00:07:27.917 --> 00:07:29.452
Who's in there?

139
00:07:29.486 --> 00:07:32.088
That is former
Congressman Devereaux.


140
00:07:32.121 --> 00:07:33.790
What does he want?

141
00:07:33.823 --> 00:07:35.325
Well, he's here to ask you

142
00:07:35.358 --> 00:07:37.894
if you will postpone
your trip to that island.


143
00:07:37.927 --> 00:07:39.496
You have
exactly eight minutes.


144
00:07:39.529 --> 00:07:40.797
Otherwise,
you'll miss your flight.


145
00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:41.764
All right,
all right.


146
00:07:43.265 --> 00:07:45.234
I appreciate this,
Charlie.


147
00:07:47.437 --> 00:07:49.439
I know why
you're here, Laird,


148
00:07:49.472 --> 00:07:52.174
and I still
have to go out there.


149
00:07:52.208 --> 00:07:55.244
Those inbred bastards
started a shooting war.
They're crazy.


150
00:07:55.278 --> 00:07:57.847
Who do you represent
in all this?


151
00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:59.248
Lobstermen's
Benevolent Association.


152
00:07:59.282 --> 00:08:02.785
There are 4,000 of them
along the Maine coast.


153
00:08:02.819 --> 00:08:04.020
They're in the right.

154
00:08:05.121 --> 00:08:06.356
How much
they paying you?


155
00:08:06.389 --> 00:08:09.091
Oh, it's almost
a charity thing.


156
00:08:09.125 --> 00:08:11.528
$25,000 a month.

157
00:08:12.595 --> 00:08:14.397
You need to go.

158
00:08:14.431 --> 00:08:17.834
Charlie, why don't you come out
to Burning Tree with me?


159
00:08:17.867 --> 00:08:19.336
Hell, you can't
stay here forever,


160
00:08:19.369 --> 00:08:20.870
but everybody
loves you, Charlie.


161
00:08:20.903 --> 00:08:23.172
Yeah, you could bill
a million dollars a month


162
00:08:23.205 --> 00:08:27.143
once you get through
the revolving door.


163
00:08:28.411 --> 00:08:32.282
Charlie, think about it.

164
00:08:32.315 --> 00:08:33.550
Drink about it.

165
00:08:33.583 --> 00:08:36.152
[ chuckles ]

166
00:08:37.253 --> 00:08:40.890
Jared, sit down a minute.

167
00:08:40.923 --> 00:08:43.125
We need to talk
about your future.


168
00:08:44.461 --> 00:08:46.563
I'm gonna need you
to help me with him,


169
00:08:46.596 --> 00:08:48.197
you know
what I mean? He--


170
00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:50.166
Charlie has
a hard head
sometimes.


171
00:08:50.199 --> 00:08:53.936
You know, the people
that I work for--


172
00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:56.973
well, with,
they're gonna run
this country soon,


173
00:08:57.006 --> 00:08:58.275
and it wouldn't
hurt you to be


174
00:08:58.308 --> 00:09:00.543
on the ground floor.
You know what I mean?


175
00:09:00.577 --> 00:09:02.445
Hell, you're gonna enjoy
being a Congressman.


176
00:09:02.479 --> 00:09:04.514
Hell, we share the pie.

177
00:09:04.547 --> 00:09:07.384
Heh heh.
Gonna share the pie.


178
00:09:07.417 --> 00:09:09.586
[ chuckles ]
You went to college,


179
00:09:09.619 --> 00:09:11.321
and you joined
a fraternity,


180
00:09:11.354 --> 00:09:12.555
didn't you?
Yes.


181
00:09:12.589 --> 00:09:14.090
Do you remember
the first time


182
00:09:14.123 --> 00:09:15.625
you came back
after fucking a virgin


183
00:09:15.658 --> 00:09:18.561
and you went back
to the house and you
shared the wealth


184
00:09:18.595 --> 00:09:20.630
and told all the boys.
Remember that? Ha ha.


185
00:09:20.663 --> 00:09:23.032
Well, that's just
the way it's gonna be.


186
00:09:23.065 --> 00:09:24.934
We all share the wealth.

187
00:09:24.967 --> 00:09:27.437
All the donors
and the virgins...


188
00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:28.538
Jared...
fresh meat.


189
00:09:28.571 --> 00:09:30.139
you're gonna miss
your flight.


190
00:09:30.172 --> 00:09:31.641
Oh. Yeah. Okay.
Jared,


191
00:09:31.674 --> 00:09:33.376
just a minute now.
Yeah.


192
00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:36.145
You don't
seem to have
a social life.


193
00:09:36.178 --> 00:09:37.614
And when you
get back here,


194
00:09:37.647 --> 00:09:39.416
I want you
to think about it.


195
00:09:39.449 --> 00:09:41.150
Call me.
Mm-hmm.


196
00:09:41.183 --> 00:09:45.154
I'm gonna
introduce you to some
exceptional friends.


197
00:09:45.187 --> 00:09:46.289
Heh.

198
00:09:46.323 --> 00:09:47.557
I look forward to it.

199
00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:49.225
I'm sure you will.
[ laughs ]


200
00:09:49.258 --> 00:09:50.360
No redheads.

201
00:09:50.393 --> 00:09:52.529
Oh, I got
a whole bunch of 'em,


202
00:09:52.562 --> 00:09:54.196
redheads,
blue heads, every damn--


203
00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:56.433
all the head
you want, pal. Uh-huh.


204
00:09:59.502 --> 00:10:02.004
[ P.A. ] Welcome
to Rockland Airport.


205
00:10:02.038 --> 00:10:04.106
Please note this is
a nonsmoking facility...


206
00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:06.208
Listen, I'm sorry
about, uh, missing
the connection,


207
00:10:06.242 --> 00:10:09.946
but the next one,
it gets us in only down
an hour behind schedule.


208
00:10:12.315 --> 00:10:15.184
Back-to-back, huh?

209
00:10:15.217 --> 00:10:17.219
[ sighs ]

210
00:10:17.253 --> 00:10:18.555
You know, it's--

211
00:10:18.588 --> 00:10:22.359
it's starting to become
noticeable, Charlie.


212
00:10:22.392 --> 00:10:25.962
"He is never so generous
as when he is giving advice."


213
00:10:25.995 --> 00:10:27.229
Well, I just--

214
00:10:27.263 --> 00:10:28.965
You know,
I'm being honest.


215
00:10:28.998 --> 00:10:31.000
I think you have
a--a problem.


216
00:10:31.033 --> 00:10:32.268
Today I do.

217
00:10:32.302 --> 00:10:34.504
I'm just tired
of the bullshit.


218
00:10:36.105 --> 00:10:38.174
You know,
maybe what you need


219
00:10:38.207 --> 00:10:42.479
is a nice,
long vacation.


220
00:10:44.213 --> 00:10:45.615
A long vacation?
Yeah.


221
00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:50.287
Get in touch with this,
you know?


222
00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:53.022
You want my job,
don't you, Jared?


223
00:10:53.055 --> 00:10:54.657
No. God, no, Charlie.

224
00:10:54.691 --> 00:10:58.295
I-I've made no secret
about possibly running
someday, yes,


225
00:10:58.328 --> 00:11:00.129
but not
while you're here.


226
00:11:00.162 --> 00:11:01.664
No, no, but you're good.
You're good.


227
00:11:01.698 --> 00:11:06.202
You have an innate sense
of the issues and
what people need.


228
00:11:06.235 --> 00:11:08.237
But why do you want it?

229
00:11:08.271 --> 00:11:11.274
Well, I've wanted it
for as long as
I can remember.


230
00:11:11.308 --> 00:11:13.042
Yeah, but why?

231
00:11:13.075 --> 00:11:15.177
You want
to serve the people?


232
00:11:15.211 --> 00:11:17.213
A lot of reasons.

233
00:11:18.648 --> 00:11:20.383
Lot of reasons.

234
00:11:20.417 --> 00:11:22.151
You know, when we're young,

235
00:11:22.184 --> 00:11:25.322
we think we're going all
the way to the mountaintop,


236
00:11:25.355 --> 00:11:28.325
and then somewhere
along the journey,


237
00:11:28.358 --> 00:11:30.593
most men
look up at the summit,


238
00:11:30.627 --> 00:11:33.596
and they realize
that they're never
gonna get there.


239
00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:38.768
Then they look down,
and they see how far
they've come,


240
00:11:38.801 --> 00:11:42.572
so they stop
to enjoy the view,


241
00:11:42.605 --> 00:11:45.442
and that is
as far as they get.


242
00:11:46.809 --> 00:11:50.146
Well, I'm going all
the way to the summit.


243
00:11:50.179 --> 00:11:53.550
Heh heh. Yeah.

244
00:11:53.583 --> 00:11:55.585
Yeah, you just might.

245
00:11:57.754 --> 00:11:58.688
You just might.

246
00:12:05.328 --> 00:12:08.698
You, uh, you want me
to go in with you, boss?


247
00:12:08.731 --> 00:12:12.101
Thanks, but the shouting part
is over, I think.


248
00:12:18.708 --> 00:12:20.242
Congressman!
[ gasps]


249
00:12:20.277 --> 00:12:21.378
It's me,
Bernie Gimpel. Hi.


250
00:12:21.411 --> 00:12:22.645
Bernie,
please don't do that.


251
00:12:22.679 --> 00:12:23.646
Okay? Please.
Yeah. I'm--I'm sorry.


252
00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:25.147
I'm sorry.

253
00:12:25.181 --> 00:12:27.617
I was in your
district office,
uh, today


254
00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:29.486
and happened to glance
at your schedule.


255
00:12:29.519 --> 00:12:31.788
I hope you don't mind.
It's very important.


256
00:12:31.821 --> 00:12:33.456
Bernie, I--I've got
to go talk to my wife.


257
00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:35.157
I'm sorry. I just got--
Yeah, look, I was--


258
00:12:35.191 --> 00:12:36.693
If you don't mind,
I really--


259
00:12:36.726 --> 00:12:38.761
I canvassed

260
00:12:38.795 --> 00:12:40.497
I'm handling
the fundraiser...


261
00:12:40.530 --> 00:12:42.231
I know.
at Wong's Chinese again,


262
00:12:42.264 --> 00:12:44.066
and I've never
asked for anything


263
00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:45.568
that I haven't earned

264
00:12:45.602 --> 00:12:48.070
with my blood, my sweat,
and my tears.


265
00:12:48.104 --> 00:12:49.205
Okay.
What is it, Bernie?


266
00:12:49.238 --> 00:12:50.373
What is it?
Okay. Okay.


267
00:12:50.407 --> 00:12:51.541
Do you know
George Kratz?


268
00:12:51.574 --> 00:12:53.343
No, I don't think so.
Yeah.


269
00:12:53.376 --> 00:12:56.313
Well, he runs
the offtrack betting
parlor in Lincolnville,


270
00:12:56.346 --> 00:12:59.382
and he had
a heart attack
this morning.


271
00:12:59.416 --> 00:13:01.183
Oh, I'm so sorry. Sorry.
Yeah.


272
00:13:01.217 --> 00:13:03.520
Well, um,
I was wondering


273
00:13:03.553 --> 00:13:05.388
if you could put me in
for his job.


274
00:13:05.422 --> 00:13:09.326
Bernie, they haven't even
had the funeral yet.


275
00:13:09.359 --> 00:13:10.560
Well, he's not dead.

276
00:13:10.593 --> 00:13:12.295
I mean,
he's very sick.


277
00:13:12.329 --> 00:13:14.531
It's just a--
a matter of time.


278
00:13:14.564 --> 00:13:16.098
I mean,
people are lining up


279
00:13:16.132 --> 00:13:17.834
at the district office
for this job--


280
00:13:17.867 --> 00:13:20.803
Bernie, I can't give you
the job of a man
that's still alive.


281
00:13:20.837 --> 00:13:23.239
It's imminent,
I tell you, imminent.


282
00:13:23.273 --> 00:13:24.240
JARED: Bernie.
I can't--


283
00:13:24.274 --> 00:13:25.542
Bernie, listen.

284
00:13:25.575 --> 00:13:27.176
The Congressman,
he's very busy right now.


285
00:13:27.209 --> 00:13:28.244
Okay, Charlie,
I'll handle this.


286
00:13:28.278 --> 00:13:29.312
Jared will handle this.

287
00:13:29.346 --> 00:13:30.313
Yeah.
He's--He's great.


288
00:13:30.347 --> 00:13:32.181
Hi. How are you?

289
00:13:32.214 --> 00:13:33.350
How am I?

290
00:13:33.383 --> 00:13:35.251
The Congressman
owes me this.


291
00:13:35.285 --> 00:13:37.086
I've worked
like a dog.


292
00:13:57.807 --> 00:14:01.778
The place is falling
to rack and ruin.


293
00:14:01.811 --> 00:14:03.580
I know.

294
00:14:03.613 --> 00:14:06.148
I don't see why
we can't afford
to mow the lawn.


295
00:14:06.182 --> 00:14:07.884
Well, every time
I try to mow it,


296
00:14:07.917 --> 00:14:11.288
one of your constituents
feels compelled to get
out of their car


297
00:14:11.321 --> 00:14:13.155
and tell me
their problems.


298
00:14:13.189 --> 00:14:16.192
I think I heard one
lurking in the bushes
a little while ago.


299
00:14:16.225 --> 00:14:18.361
Yeah. We just
had a nice talk.


300
00:14:18.395 --> 00:14:20.497
He wants an almost
dead guy's job.


301
00:14:20.530 --> 00:14:21.498
Drink?

302
00:14:21.531 --> 00:14:22.799
I made myself at home.

303
00:14:22.832 --> 00:14:24.334
I hope you don't mind.

304
00:14:24.367 --> 00:14:26.268
It's still your house.

305
00:14:26.303 --> 00:14:28.305
Yeah,
for three more days.


306
00:14:28.338 --> 00:14:30.440
Could've kept it,
you know.


307
00:14:30.473 --> 00:14:34.711
I loved it here,
but there's just
too much.


308
00:14:36.413 --> 00:14:37.747
Yeah.

309
00:14:46.222 --> 00:14:50.427
I'd like to set a date
for dividing the rest
of the things.


310
00:14:52.362 --> 00:14:54.364
Divorce was

that maybe we could just--

from the island.

Good.

I broke John Randolph's nose
on the basketball court,

in the House chamber
with my feet up on a desk

when they were reciting
the Pledge of Alliance,

cost me my job.

over the years.

Yeah, well, I'm not sure
I even care anymore.

It's just not the same.

329
00:15:38.941 --> 00:15:40.610
There was a time
when Congress was important,


330
00:15:40.643 --> 00:15:42.845
when it meant something
to be there.


331

Now it's all
about delivering money
for some bus station.

kind of irrelevant.

Well, welcome
to my world.

I think the straw that
broke the camel's back
for me

is when
I had to call Abigail

to make you feel it...

and now I just want
to be free, you know?

I want to mean
something to someone

who believed that
the government should
take over the schools.

He ordained
that the Pledge
should be recited

00:22:52.442 --> 00:22:54.677
while all American
schoolchildren stood


470
00:22:54.711 --> 00:22:57.213
and gave the so-called
Bellamy salute.

Have you ever seen
the Bellamy salute?

Cooler heads prevailed,

and that part
of the Pledge
was dropped


476
00:23:09.025 --> 00:23:10.660

declared war on us.

we have another shocking example

from traditional American values

This is Congressman
Charles Winship of Maine,

00:26:50.079 --> 00:26:55.352
who has allegedly
equated the American
Pledge of Allegiance

with the stiff-armed Nazi salute
of Adolph Hitler.

We caught
his ugly rant on camera

00:27:03.259 --> 00:27:06.663
after we asked Winship
why he refused to stand

of Allegiance in Congress.

that Winship
believes American children

00:50:53.590 --> 00:50:56.493
No, no,
I meant the--this...


948
00:50:56.526 --> 00:50:59.962
Sometimes
the fog gets so thick,
you can't see your hand.


949
00:51:02.865 --> 00:51:07.837
The ancients believed
that each day brought
a new life.

That's Brad.


951
00:51:21.584 --> 00:51:22.919
Oh, Brad.

952
00:51:22.952 --> 00:51:24.621
Stay here.

953
00:51:27.724 --> 00:51:29.559
Hey, where were you
last night?


954
00:51:29.592 --> 00:51:31.461
I don't have time
for this, Brad.


955
00:51:31.494 --> 00:51:32.495
Come on.

956
00:51:32.529 --> 00:51:34.964
I never said
I loved you.


957
00:51:34.997 --> 00:51:36.966
I don't love you.

958
00:51:36.999 --> 00:51:39.736
I'm so sick
of your issues.


959
00:51:51.581 --> 00:51:55.718
I'm--I'm sorry
you had to see that.


960
00:51:55.752 --> 00:51:58.020
Oh, that's okay.

961
00:51:58.054 --> 00:52:00.690
Are you two
involved, or...


962
00:52:03.225 --> 00:52:07.730
To be brutally honest,
it's just very good sex.


963

[ laughs ]

964
00:52:08.898 --> 00:52:11.434
Physically
I enjoyed him very much.


965
00:52:11.468 --> 00:52:13.670
He is a wonderful lover.
That's nice.


966
00:52:13.703 --> 00:52:15.872
You know--You know what?
I think probably--We should
probably head down.


967
00:52:15.905 --> 00:52:17.874
I think he thought he
could convince me that we


968
00:52:17.907 --> 00:52:19.141
were more than just--

969
00:52:19.175 --> 00:52:22.579
Anyway, I never
meant to hurt him.


970
00:52:22.612 --> 00:52:23.913
No. No, of course not.

971
00:52:23.946 --> 00:52:25.615
You know, I probably
should actually--


972
00:52:25.648 --> 00:52:28.518
I feel terrible about
using him that way.


973
00:52:28.551 --> 00:52:31.788
Well, I'm sure it wasn't
all that hard to endure.


974
00:52:31.821 --> 00:52:34.023
Well, I mean,
at first, anyway.


975
00:52:34.056 --> 00:52:36.659
But I really
do have a dozen stop-bys
on Saturday.


976
00:52:36.693 --> 00:52:38.595
What are stop-bys?

977
00:52:38.628 --> 00:52:41.564
Well, let's see.
There's the Blue and Gold
Cub Scout dinner,


978
00:52:41.598 --> 00:52:43.500
the Rotary Club dance,

979
00:52:43.533 --> 00:52:45.034
the dog show in Bristol,

980
00:52:45.067 --> 00:52:47.003
the Shenango
Fire Department dinner.


981
00:52:47.036 --> 00:52:49.839
Why don't you
let me cook you dinner?


982
00:52:49.872 --> 00:52:51.808
Ah, is that
an island decision?


983
00:52:51.841 --> 00:52:53.242
An island decision?

984
00:52:53.276 --> 00:52:57.113
Yeah, to subvert me
from my public
responsibilities?


985
00:52:57.146 --> 00:52:58.581
You're an idiot.

986
00:52:58.615 --> 00:53:00.817
No, it is my decision,

987
00:53:00.850 --> 00:53:05.788
and I have two two-pound
lobsters on ice
back at my cottage.


988
00:53:09.091 --> 00:53:10.860
Okay. I'll stay.

989
00:54:02.979 --> 00:54:04.914
Oh. Thank you.

Well, did you
learn something?


992
00:54:12.322 --> 00:54:14.624
Yeah. I did.

993
00:54:14.657 --> 00:54:16.092
I did.

994
00:54:16.125 --> 00:54:18.027
Yeah, by the way,

995
00:54:18.060 --> 00:54:22.332
what are 132 lobsters
worth on the mainland?


996
00:54:22.365 --> 00:54:25.234
Well, $3.00 a pound
for soft-shell,


997
00:54:25.267 --> 00:54:27.036
$5.00 for hard.

Got fuel.
Got bait.


999
00:54:29.739 --> 00:54:31.941
About $1,200.

1000
00:54:31.974 --> 00:54:36.713
Well, hey,
not a bad day's catch
for you guys, right?

00:54:36.746 --> 00:54:38.915
Those aren't my traps.

got sunk.


1004
00:54:43.052 --> 00:54:44.987
You just helped out
his family.


1005
00:54:52.395 --> 00:54:53.763
Good job.

1006

even burn anymore.

I'm not so bad, right?
Not so bad.

in the line of duty.

at Matty's with a young man
named, uh, Ben.

Yeah.
Matty always steps up.

She took him in

He was raised
in foster homes
and badly abused.

He's actually
a really sweet kid

00:57:52.942 --> 00:57:56.446
and a wonderful
portrait artist,
a real prodigy.


1077
00:57:56.479 --> 00:58:00.417
I thought that
he was, uh, the stern man
on one of the lobster boats.


1078
00:58:00.450 --> 00:58:02.419
He does that as well
to get a closer feel

00:58:02.452 --> 00:58:04.354
for the lives
of the fishermen.

1103
00:59:09.386 --> 00:59:11.488
Something about
an Nazi salute


1104
00:59:11.521 --> 00:59:14.824
and desecration
of the Pledge
of Allegiance.


1105
00:59:18.561 --> 00:59:22.231
So much for exercising
my First Amendment rights.


1106
00:59:22.264 --> 00:59:24.901
Did you do that?

1107
00:59:24.934 --> 00:59:26.469
It's a long story, Sherm.

1108
00:59:29.071 --> 00:59:30.307
Well, they want you
down there


1109
00:59:30.340 --> 00:59:31.641
first thing
Monday morning.


1110
00:59:31.674 --> 00:59:34.344
Should I tell
your assistant?


1111
00:59:34.377 --> 00:59:37.280
No. No, I'd rather
tell him myself. Thanks.


1112
00:59:37.314 --> 00:59:38.515
Okay.

1113
00:59:45.187 --> 00:59:46.956
What is he
talking about?


1114
00:59:49.326 --> 00:59:53.029
The artist really
captured ol' Matty, huh?


1115
00:59:53.062 --> 00:59:56.032
Jesus.

1116
00:59:56.065 --> 00:59:58.435
She's gay, right?

1117
00:59:58.468 --> 00:59:59.636
She's gotta be gay.

1118
00:59:59.669 --> 01:00:01.338
I mean, not that I have--

1119
01:00:01.371 --> 01:00:03.373
I have
anything against that.
I don't, personally.


1120
01:00:03.406 --> 01:00:06.609
It's not a big deal
to me, but, uh,


1121
01:00:06.643 --> 01:00:08.210
she scares me
a little bit,


1122
01:00:08.244 --> 01:00:10.547
you know?
She's mannish.


1123
01:00:10.580 --> 01:00:14.484
I'm just saying
I wouldn't want to,
uh, run into her


1124
01:00:14.517 --> 01:00:16.986
in a dark alley.
You know what I mean?


1125
01:00:17.019 --> 01:00:19.956
Heard you talking
about that painting.


1126
01:00:19.989 --> 01:00:21.257
Um, yes.

1127
01:00:21.291 --> 01:00:23.125
The painting
is very good.


1128
01:00:23.159 --> 01:00:24.994
It's very good.
I was wondering,


1129
01:00:25.027 --> 01:00:27.196
uh, you know,
who the artist was.


1130
01:00:27.229 --> 01:00:29.366
You're sitting
right next to him.


1131
01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:32.034
You?

1132
01:00:32.068 --> 01:00:33.503
You painted that?

1133
01:00:34.537 --> 01:00:36.706
Yeah.

1134
01:00:36.739 --> 01:00:38.174
Wow.

1135
01:00:38.207 --> 01:00:39.542
Ben, that's amazing.

1136
01:00:39.576 --> 01:00:41.243
You should
be really proud
of yourself.


1137
01:00:41.278 --> 01:00:42.979
Thank you.

1138
01:00:43.012 --> 01:00:45.181
Well, cheers.

1139
01:00:48.150 --> 01:00:50.152
Full of mystery,
huh?


1140
01:00:52.121 --> 01:00:55.658
So, what are
you gonna do?


1141
01:00:55.692 --> 01:01:01.431
Go back and deal with it,
I guess, but not tonight.


1142
01:01:01.464 --> 01:01:06.268
Tonight I just want
to have dinner.


1143
01:01:06.303 --> 01:01:08.371
You're not a neo-Nazi,
are you?


1144
01:01:08.405 --> 01:01:09.639
[ laughs ] No.

1145
01:01:09.672 --> 01:01:11.107
I was making a point,

1146
01:01:11.140 --> 01:01:13.009
and it was taken
out of context.


1147
01:01:13.042 --> 01:01:14.411
I understand.

1148
01:01:14.444 --> 01:01:17.246
Thank you.

1149
01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:20.283
You remember telling me
that visitors who come here


1150
01:01:20.317 --> 01:01:21.684
need a few days
to slow down


1151
01:01:21.718 --> 01:01:23.520
to the rhythm
of the sea and the tides?


1152
01:01:23.553 --> 01:01:24.287
Mm-hmm.

1153
01:01:28.157 --> 01:01:30.960
I haven't slowed down
for 18 years.


1154
01:01:32.462 --> 01:01:35.698
Is that how you lost
your marriage?


1155
01:01:35.732 --> 01:01:37.434
Well, in spite
of what my ex-wife thinks,


1156
01:01:37.467 --> 01:01:39.336
it wasn't because
of the perks of the job.


1157
01:01:39.369 --> 01:01:43.373
I knew what to expect
when I went down there.


1158
01:01:43.406 --> 01:01:46.576
You get elected
to Congress, and suddenly
your jokes are funny.


1159
01:01:46.609 --> 01:01:50.280
You discover that you're
God's gift to women,
all the wrong women.


1160
01:01:50.313 --> 01:01:54.150
You get nonstop flattery
from people who all want
something from you,


1161
01:01:54.183 --> 01:01:57.119
but those things were
never a problem for me.


1162
01:01:57.153 --> 01:01:59.322
Then what was it?

1163
01:02:03.393 --> 01:02:06.228
It was this need...

1164
01:02:08.064 --> 01:02:11.167
a need that became
the most compelling thing
in my life...


1165
01:02:13.135 --> 01:02:16.473
more important than my wife
or our marriage or...


1166
01:02:19.208 --> 01:02:20.209
You got kids?

1167
01:02:21.378 --> 01:02:22.379
No.

1168
01:02:22.412 --> 01:02:24.113
I'd still like to.

1169
01:02:24.146 --> 01:02:28.184
Well, that superseded
even them


1170
01:02:28.217 --> 01:02:30.186
and everything else
in my life.


1171
01:02:30.219 --> 01:02:32.221
I don't understand.

1172
01:02:32.254 --> 01:02:35.792
When I got out
of the Marine Corps,


1173
01:02:35.825 --> 01:02:39.228
I felt like I was living
on borrowed time.


1174
01:02:39.261 --> 01:02:43.533
If I didn't accomplish enough
in a given day or week,


1175
01:02:43.566 --> 01:02:49.539
it was like falling behind
in my whole reason
for having survived,


1176
01:02:49.572 --> 01:02:54.511
and I was one day closer
to dying without having
made a difference.


1177
01:02:54.544 --> 01:02:59.716
Hey, maybe you have made
a difference, Charlie.


1178
01:02:59.749 --> 01:03:03.720
Maybe it's just time
to hang up your armor.


1179
01:03:05.888 --> 01:03:08.124
Not that easy.

1180
01:03:08.157 --> 01:03:09.392
Of course it is.

1181
01:03:09.426 --> 01:03:11.361
[ chuckles ]

1182
01:03:11.394 --> 01:03:14.564
Well, not right now.

1183
01:03:16.132 --> 01:03:18.668
Wow, you're
an amazing artist.


1184
01:03:18.701 --> 01:03:22.639
Ben, you really--
You are, man.


1185
01:03:22.672 --> 01:03:23.606
You're great.

1186
01:03:25.408 --> 01:03:27.710
Do you think
I could do one of you?


1187
01:03:27.744 --> 01:03:29.746
What?

1188
01:03:29.779 --> 01:03:31.514
Yeah.

1189
01:03:32.882 --> 01:03:34.684
[ chuckles ]

1190
01:03:36.218 --> 01:03:37.387
Yeah.

1191
01:03:37.420 --> 01:03:39.622
Yeah.
I would be honored.


1192
01:03:39.656 --> 01:03:41.391
What do I
need to do?


1193
01:03:41.424 --> 01:03:44.461
Just, uh, sit on the bed.

1194
01:03:47.397 --> 01:03:48.465
Okay.

1195
01:03:48.498 --> 01:03:49.499
You got it.

1196
01:03:49.532 --> 01:03:52.168
[ laughs ]

1197
01:03:52.201 --> 01:03:53.336
Thank you.

1198
01:03:54.471 --> 01:03:55.772
Wow.

1199
01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:06.182
Turn this way.

1200
01:04:07.584 --> 01:04:09.452
Like this?

1201
01:04:09.486 --> 01:04:10.520
Yeah.

1202
01:04:10.553 --> 01:04:12.322
I put this up?
Is that--


1203
01:04:12.355 --> 01:04:14.624
This is very new to me.
[ laughs ]


1204
01:04:19.896 --> 01:04:20.897
[ laughs ]

1205
01:04:20.930 --> 01:04:22.865
Sit still.
Okay.


1206
01:04:22.899 --> 01:04:24.266
Open your eyes.

1207
01:04:24.301 --> 01:04:25.234
Oh, I'm sorry.

1208
01:04:26.836 --> 01:04:28.137
Good.

1209
01:04:41.351 --> 01:04:43.420
Am I allowed to talk?

1210
01:04:43.453 --> 01:04:44.821
Whatever you want.

1211
01:04:56.333 --> 01:04:57.634
Rae,

1212
01:04:57.667 --> 01:05:00.770
is that--Is that
short for Raymond?


1213
01:05:00.803 --> 01:05:02.572
[ laughs ]
No.


1214
01:05:02.605 --> 01:05:03.840
It's a family name,

1215
01:05:03.873 --> 01:05:06.609
but you can call me
Raymond if you like.


1216
01:05:06.643 --> 01:05:08.478
No, you know,
I might just--


1217
01:05:08.511 --> 01:05:09.779
Ahh. Ah, God.

1218
01:05:09.812 --> 01:05:11.681
What is it?
Are you okay?


1219
01:05:11.714 --> 01:05:13.716
Oh, it's my back.

1220
01:05:13.750 --> 01:05:16.786
It's got a life of its own,
likes to remind me.


1221
01:05:16.819 --> 01:05:18.955
Well, it shouldn't.
Let me help you.


1222
01:05:18.988 --> 01:05:20.423
Oh, boy.
Come here.


1223
01:05:20.457 --> 01:05:21.958
Okay. [ winces ]

1224
01:05:21.991 --> 01:05:22.959
You all right?

1225
01:05:22.992 --> 01:05:24.294
Yeah, I think.
[ groans ]


1226
01:05:24.327 --> 01:05:26.363
Oh, man.

1227
01:05:26.396 --> 01:05:28.731
All right,
take off your shirt.


1228
01:05:28.765 --> 01:05:29.932
What?

1229
01:05:29.966 --> 01:05:30.933
Take off your shirt.

1230
01:05:30.967 --> 01:05:32.569
Lie down
on your stomach.


1231
01:05:32.602 --> 01:05:34.537
I'm gonna give you
a massage.


1232
01:05:34.571 --> 01:05:36.238
What's that?

1233
01:05:36.273 --> 01:05:40.477
Magic elixirs
from the fairies
in our enchanted forest.


1234
01:05:40.510 --> 01:05:41.578
Oh, man.

1235
01:05:41.611 --> 01:05:43.613
[ wincing ]
Ow.


1236
01:05:43.646 --> 01:05:44.947
Ay.
[ laughs ]


1237
01:05:44.981 --> 01:05:46.616
Oh, my goodness.

1238
01:05:46.649 --> 01:05:47.684
All right.

1239
01:05:47.717 --> 01:05:49.552
Ow.

1240
01:05:49.586 --> 01:05:53.390
There we go. Now...

1241
01:05:53.423 --> 01:05:54.524
[ gasping ]

1242
01:05:54.557 --> 01:05:56.626
There we go.
Deep breaths.


1243
01:05:56.659 --> 01:05:59.396
Ooh. Take it easy on me.
I'm kind of a wimp.


1244
01:05:59.429 --> 01:06:01.298
[ laughs ]

1245
01:06:01.331 --> 01:06:02.632
All right.

1246
01:06:02.665 --> 01:06:04.033
Oh, boy.
All right.


1247
01:06:04.066 --> 01:06:06.703
I'm gonna have to bring in
the big guns.


1248
01:06:06.736 --> 01:06:07.670
Oh, my God.

1249
01:06:07.704 --> 01:06:09.472
Oh.

1250
01:06:09.506 --> 01:06:12.809
Hey, this is better
than the lobster.


1251
01:06:12.842 --> 01:06:14.544
Aha.
[ laughs ]


1252
01:06:17.747 --> 01:06:21.050
Um, Ben, I--

1253
01:06:21.083 --> 01:06:23.386
Listen, I don't
mean to be rude,


1254
01:06:23.420 --> 01:06:27.023
but I'm exhausted,
and I need to sleep.


1255
01:06:28.858 --> 01:06:30.760
Want to see what I got?

1256
01:06:30.793 --> 01:06:31.828
Yeah.

1257
01:06:43.973 --> 01:06:45.742
Wow.

1258
01:06:47.544 --> 01:06:49.612
It's me,

1259
01:06:49.646 --> 01:06:52.515
but far too flattering.

1260
01:06:55.785 --> 01:06:58.921
Well, that's
how I see you.


1261
01:06:58.955 --> 01:07:00.957
Thank you.

1265
01:07:15.538 --> 01:07:17.807
Where did you
learn to do that?


1266
01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:19.376
I had a lot of practice.

1267
01:07:19.409 --> 01:07:21.711
My husband
was a fisherman.


1268
01:07:21.744 --> 01:07:23.446
I mean, this is amazing.

1269
01:07:23.480 --> 01:07:25.648
I'm--I'm actually
pain-free.


1270
01:07:25.682 --> 01:07:27.850
I haven't felt
this way for months.

1272
01:07:28.985 --> 01:07:30.987
I don't know
how to thank you.


1273
01:07:31.020 --> 01:07:35.492
Help us keep this place
the way it is.


1274
01:07:38.395 --> 01:07:39.329
Come sit.

1275
01:08:11.461 --> 01:08:12.562
I should go.

1276
01:08:12.595 --> 01:08:13.563
Why?

1277
01:08:13.596 --> 01:08:15.732
It's a small island.

1278
01:08:15.765 --> 01:08:17.634
People'll talk.

1279
01:08:17.667 --> 01:08:19.769
You're worried about
your precious reputation?


1280
01:08:19.802 --> 01:08:21.571
No.

1281
01:08:21.604 --> 01:08:23.139
I'm worried
about yours.

[ laughs ]

1283
01:08:25.141 --> 01:08:27.910
This is the least
judgmental place you'll
ever find, Congressman,


1284
01:08:27.944 --> 01:08:30.413
and it's been that way
for a long time.


1285
01:08:30.447 --> 01:08:35.918
Intolerance is
the least of our problems.


1286
01:08:35.952 --> 01:08:37.019
Listen...

1287

01:08:43.660 --> 01:08:46.829
I think I was chasing
that excitement,

01:08:46.863 --> 01:08:50.533
that sense
of anticipation.


1291
01:08:50.567 --> 01:08:52.034
You know what I mean?

1292
01:08:54.136 --> 01:08:57.173
I think I've been lonely
for a long time, Charlie.


1293
01:08:58.941 --> 01:09:00.743
You said up
on the cliffs that you
weren't lonely.


1294
01:09:04.914 --> 01:09:07.484
I guess I lied.

that we can do?

Yeah,

or maybe the Coast Guard
or the fire department?

Congressman!

01:11:28.791 --> 01:11:31.294
I really fucked up,
Charlie.


1323
01:11:31.328 --> 01:11:34.230
I think, uh--
I think Devereaux
was behind this.


1324
01:11:34.263 --> 01:11:35.798
Who?

1325
01:11:35.832 --> 01:11:38.134
Former
Congressman Devereaux.


1326
01:11:38.167 --> 01:11:40.903
He doesn't just represent
the other lobstermen of Maine.


1327
01:11:40.937 --> 01:11:45.975
Okay, he also works
for a multinational
seafood conglomerate.


1328
01:11:46.008 --> 01:11:48.345
Their catch,
it's less and less each year,


1329
01:11:48.378 --> 01:11:49.946
and they want
these grounds.


1330
01:11:49.979 --> 01:11:51.981
They need these grounds,
Charlie.


1331
01:11:52.014 --> 01:11:53.683
Where did I fit in?

1332
01:11:59.021 --> 01:12:02.325
They wanted me
to make sure


1333
01:12:02.359 --> 01:12:05.695
that you didn't end up
defending these people.


1334
01:12:05.728 --> 01:12:08.765
So you hitched
your wagon to him
for what?


1335
01:12:08.798 --> 01:12:10.733
Why?

1336
01:12:10.767 --> 01:12:11.968
What was the price?

1337
01:12:12.001 --> 01:12:13.102

1338

bought Deidre Macavoy,
too, don't you?

Listen, Charlie,
that's not it.

He's--He's got plans,
okay?

For you, for this island.

1345

He's got a boatload
of media coming up here
to expose these people.


1346
01:12:47.704 --> 01:12:49.406
When will they get here?

Why don't you


1357
01:13:59.409 --> 01:14:02.244
come down to Washington
sometime, you know,


1358
01:14:02.279 --> 01:14:05.147

Yeah.

see the National
Portrait Gallery.

You know, your stuff
will probably be
hanging there someday.

All right.

1363

maybe when
lobster season ends.

or...

Charlie's gonna
be expelled,

you're gonna get

have to step up.

doing it, huh?
They're gonna expel him?

you remind me
of Jimmy Stewart

in "It's
a Wonderful Life."

Do you remember how
he spent his entire life

01:17:44.066 --> 01:17:46.369
trying to protect
his beautiful
Bedford Falls

Mr. Potter?

Yeah. Zuzu's petals.

1426
01:17:52.275 --> 01:17:57.046
That's Pottersville,
at least to me.

Yes, I think I can.

1430

Sounds like the bus
to Pottersville is here.

Yep.

Why don't you stay here,
Congressman?

[ laughs ]
And do what?


1434
01:18:20.169 --> 01:18:23.340
Ah, I've been thinking
about cutting back
on my portfolio.


1435

I might
be persuaded to give up
the garbage concession.

Now that's something
to look forward to.


1437

You're up against
some serious predators.

bigger storms than this
in the past 400 years.

I know you have.

01:18:56.606 --> 01:18:58.608
I'll do what I can
for you in Washington.

You've all
taught me a lot.

to book the tickets

Congressman Randolph
has accused you of

He has a right
to his opinion.

Hey, guys,
right this way.

This is the best
I could do.

their space, so...

You flew

Oh, I wouldn't

Well, it turns out that
Congressman Winship is
right about one thing.


1481
01:21:17.947 --> 01:21:20.483
Until Nazi Germany
declared war on the U.S.,


1482

American schoolchildren
recited the Pledge of Allegiance

for you, son.

you'd want to know.

The committee
voted to authorize
an expulsion motion.


1492
01:21:55.685 --> 01:22:01.658
Now, right now, I'd say
the full House vote is
a foregone conclusion.


1493
01:22:01.691 --> 01:22:04.527
So what
are my high crimes
and misdemeanors?

Flagrant disobedience
of House rules,

I didn't think
you'd ever quit, Charlie,

I wouldn't make it

I made
a very selfish decision,

the Pledge of Allegiance

Yeah!
You aren't American!


1551
01:26:36.766 --> 01:26:38.901
The second charge is true.

01:26:38.935 --> 01:26:41.671
[ booing ]

1553
01:26:41.704 --> 01:26:43.172
On any number of occasions,

1554
01:26:43.205 --> 01:26:46.543
I have failed to stand
and recite the Pledge.


1555
01:26:46.576 --> 01:26:48.778
On other occasions,
I have stood,


1556
01:26:48.811 --> 01:26:51.281
but failed to repeat the words.

1557
01:26:51.314 --> 01:26:54.617
Since these charges
were filed,


1558
01:26:54.651 --> 01:26:59.055
some of my colleagues
have chosen to publicly
question my patriotism,


1559
01:26:59.088 --> 01:27:01.691
my loyalty to my country,

1560
01:27:01.724 --> 01:27:03.993
and even
my fundamental Americanism.


1561
01:27:04.026 --> 01:27:05.628
To tell you the truth,

1562
01:27:05.662 --> 01:27:09.131
I don't much care
what they think or say about me.


1563
01:27:09.165 --> 01:27:13.002
What I do care about
is that those charges are a lie.


1564
01:27:18.608 --> 01:27:20.310
What makes us unique
as Americans


1565
01:27:20.343 --> 01:27:24.547
isn't a bumper sticker
or a patriotic song,


1566
01:27:24.581 --> 01:27:28.050
the flag, or even
the Pledge of Allegiance.


1567
01:27:28.084 --> 01:27:31.253
What makes us different
is that no American


1568
01:27:31.288 --> 01:27:35.257
is required to take
a pledge of allegiance


1569
01:27:35.292 --> 01:27:39.195
to a king or a dictator
or even to a flag.


1570
01:27:40.363 --> 01:27:43.132
We are a free people.

1571
01:27:43.165 --> 01:27:47.604
Now, the American flag is
a symbol of that freedom,


1572
01:27:47.637 --> 01:27:50.307
an important and
wonderful symbol.


1573
01:27:50.340 --> 01:27:52.275
In my life, I've seen it flying

1574
01:27:52.309 --> 01:27:54.877
in a lot of places
around the world.


1575
01:27:54.911 --> 01:27:59.682
In 1970, I saw it flying
above a hill called Khe Sanh


1576
01:27:59.716 --> 01:28:02.785
in the Quang Tri province
of Vietnam.


1577
01:28:02.819 --> 01:28:04.587
Seeing it flying there above us

1578
01:28:04.621 --> 01:28:07.924
and later on in many
other places around the world


1579
01:28:07.957 --> 01:28:11.594
has never ceased to fill me
with enormous pride.


1580
01:28:11.628 --> 01:28:17.233
But to me, that pride comes
from what the flag represents,


1581
01:28:17.266 --> 01:28:22.605
what it symbolizes,
not just the flag itself.


1582
01:28:22.639 --> 01:28:25.241
As Americans, we are different,

1583
01:28:25.275 --> 01:28:28.044
because we were
the first nation in the world


1584
01:28:28.077 --> 01:28:30.146
to be founded on an idea,

1585
01:28:30.179 --> 01:28:35.217
the idea that each of us
has value as an individual


1586
01:28:35.251 --> 01:28:38.955
and that we are free
to express ourselves


1587
01:28:38.988 --> 01:28:42.792
in any way we choose

1588
01:28:42.825 --> 01:28:46.062
or not to express
ourselves at all.


1589
01:28:46.095 --> 01:28:48.398
In 1950, Margaret Chase Smith,

1590
01:28:48.431 --> 01:28:51.167
a Republican senator
from right here in Maine


1591
01:28:51.200 --> 01:28:53.202
chose to take on
a fellow senator


1592
01:28:53.235 --> 01:28:55.405
who had questioned
her patriotism.


1593
01:28:55.438 --> 01:28:59.676
His name was Joseph McCarthy.

1594
01:28:59.709 --> 01:29:01.944
And this is what she said.

1595
01:29:04.914 --> 01:29:07.216
"Those who shout the loudest
about Americanism


1596
01:29:07.249 --> 01:29:09.752
"are all too frequently
those who ignore


1597
01:29:09.786 --> 01:29:12.855
"some of the basic principles
of Americanism,


1598
01:29:12.889 --> 01:29:15.224
"the right to criticize,

1599
01:29:15.257 --> 01:29:17.927
"the right
to hold unpopular beliefs,


1600
01:29:17.960 --> 01:29:19.996
"the right to protest,

1601
01:29:20.029 --> 01:29:24.000
the right
of independent thought."


1602
01:29:24.033 --> 01:29:27.370
Now, at the start
of each Congressional session,


1603
01:29:27.404 --> 01:29:29.138
those of us
privileged enough


1604
01:29:29.171 --> 01:29:31.441
to serve
in the United States Congress


1605
01:29:31.474 --> 01:29:34.777
swear an oath
to uphold the Constitution


1606
01:29:34.811 --> 01:29:37.780
and every freedom
that this nation holds dear.


1607
01:29:41.117 --> 01:29:45.388
I have taken that oath
nine times on your behalf,


1608
01:29:45.422 --> 01:29:48.124
and I have always repeated
those words


1609
01:29:48.157 --> 01:29:51.060
with the deepest humility.

1610
01:29:51.093 --> 01:29:53.996
I believe in the Constitution.

1611
01:29:54.030 --> 01:29:57.066
I believe in those words.

1612
01:29:57.099 --> 01:29:59.201
I fought for them.

1613
01:30:06.142 --> 01:30:07.944
The Pledge of Allegiance

1614
01:30:07.977 --> 01:30:11.047
is a fine symbol
for the freedoms we enjoy.


1615
01:30:11.080 --> 01:30:12.749
I believe in its words, too.

1616
01:30:12.782 --> 01:30:15.385
I do.

1617
01:30:15.418 --> 01:30:17.320
But I don't need
to recite them every morning


1618
01:30:17.354 --> 01:30:21.458
to prove that I love
my country, and I won't.


1619
01:30:21.491 --> 01:30:24.394
I have that right.

1620
01:30:24.427 --> 01:30:26.963
I'm an American.

Will you take
a look at this?

01:31:13.175 --> 01:31:14.911
You are really
turning them around.


1626
01:31:14.944 --> 01:31:17.146
Next year, you won't
have to campaign
so hard. Heh.


1627
01:31:24.220 --> 01:31:25.822
You know, Charlie,
the people behind Devereaux


1628
01:31:25.855 --> 01:31:27.290
are not gonna
give up this easy.


1629
01:31:28.591 --> 01:31:31.828
This isn't over,
not by a long shot.


1630
01:31:34.531 --> 01:31:36.499
It is for me.

1631
01:31:36.533 --> 01:31:39.235
I'm hanging up
my armor.


1632
01:31:39.268 --> 01:31:40.303
I'm done here.

1633
01:31:43.840 --> 01:31:46.242
What about you?

1634
01:31:46.276 --> 01:31:48.511
You ready to try
for the summit?


1635
01:31:50.947 --> 01:31:53.182
After what I did?

1636
01:31:53.215 --> 01:31:57.053
I'm starting to believe
in second chances.


1637
01:32:01.223 --> 01:32:02.525
Thank you, Charlie.

1638
01:32:05.094 --> 01:32:08.064
I have the Commandant
of the Coast Guard
on the line.


1639
01:32:15.972 --> 01:32:17.807
CHARLIE:
You better get that.


1640

Admiral.

1641
01:32:26.516 --> 01:32:29.919
Yes,
this is Jared Barnes.


1642
01:32:29.952 --> 01:32:32.188
Congressman Winship
convinced Governor Cabot


1643
01:32:32.221 --> 01:32:34.457
to declare the waters
around Catatonk


1644
01:32:34.491 --> 01:32:38.928
officially off limits
to commercial fishing.


1645
01:32:38.961 --> 01:32:40.863

01:33:13.162 --> 01:33:15.532
* It's a pretty sight

will rearrange things *

is chase that same dream *
