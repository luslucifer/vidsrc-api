1
00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:20.703
Dani?

2
00:02:52.758 --> 00:02:53.591
Claire.

3
00:08:54.519 --> 00:08:55.352
Help!

4
00:08:57.241 --> 00:08:58.074
Anybody!

5
00:09:33.296 --> 00:09:36.386
Tonight's top story,
the notorious serial killer,...


6
00:09:36.387 --> 00:09:39.455
...Edward Wojowski's gruesome
reign of terror over the city...


7
00:09:39.456 --> 00:09:42.563
...of Pittsburgh came to an end
today with the escape...


8
00:09:42.564 --> 00:09:45.922
...of one of his would-be victims
from an abandoned steel mill.


9
00:09:45.923 --> 00:09:48.666
Unconfirmed police reports
indicate that the killer,...


10
00:09:48.667 --> 00:09:51.605
...popularly referred to
as The Survivalist,...


11
00:09:51.606 --> 00:09:54.842
...was killed by an unidentified
female when she escaped,...


12
00:09:54.843 --> 00:09:58.843
...despite severe injuries,
to South Side Hospital.


13
00:10:15.758 --> 00:10:17.933
How are you feeling?

14
00:10:17.934 --> 00:10:18.767
Okay.

15
00:10:19.646 --> 00:10:23.125
Well, I've looked at your
x-rays and the CT scan.


16
00:10:23.126 --> 00:10:25.325
There is some ligament
damage to your knee.


17
00:10:25.326 --> 00:10:28.216
It's gonna require therapy
and a bit of time...


18
00:10:28.217 --> 00:10:29.800
...to completely mend.

19
00:10:31.137 --> 00:10:35.637
Your eye on the other hand,
well, there's been some damage.


20
00:10:35.638 --> 00:10:37.736
Best thing we can do is
leave this bandage on...


21
00:10:37.737 --> 00:10:40.973
...for the next week,
let nature run its course.


22
00:10:40.974 --> 00:10:43.637
I'm afraid you're not gonna
get all of your vision back,...


23
00:10:43.638 --> 00:10:46.555
...but there will be some improvement.

24
00:10:48.584 --> 00:10:49.417
Thanks.

25
00:10:53.228 --> 00:10:55.243
My most pressing concern right now,...

26
00:10:55.244 --> 00:10:57.034
...is for your state
of mental well-being.


27
00:10:57.035 --> 00:10:59.125
A traumatic event like this,...

28
00:10:59.126 --> 00:11:02.793
...it's gonna be difficult
for you to get over.


29
00:11:04.537 --> 00:11:06.467
This is the number
of a friend of mine.

30
00:11:06.468 --> 00:11:09.835
He can help you get through this.

31
00:11:09.836 --> 00:11:11.075
Give him a call.

32
00:11:11.076 --> 00:11:12.576
He's a good guy.

33
00:11:12.577 --> 00:11:16.327
But like your eye, it's
gonna take some time.


34
00:11:26.627 --> 00:11:28.044
No, no, no, no.

35
00:11:29.995 --> 00:11:30.828
No!

36
00:11:31.885 --> 00:11:33.306
No, no, no.

37
00:11:33.307 --> 00:11:34.557
No, no, no, no.

38
00:11:35.885 --> 00:11:39.433
No, no no no no,
no, no no no no.

39
00:11:39.434 --> 00:11:40.693
No.

40
00:12:12.392 --> 00:12:13.725
This is, uh--

41
00:12:15.343 --> 00:12:16.676
Monday, May 5th.

42
00:12:17.671 --> 00:12:20.673
This is the interview
with Penelope Warren,...


43
00:12:20.674 --> 00:12:23.574
...by detective Jake Mosser,...

44
00:12:23.575 --> 00:12:27.575
...relating to the events
of April 29th to May 2nd.


45
00:12:30.514 --> 00:12:33.430
Can I get you a water, coffee,...

46
00:12:33.431 --> 00:12:35.924
...something like that, Miss Warren?

47
00:12:35.925 --> 00:12:38.342
No, no I'm fine, thank you.

48
00:12:40.127 --> 00:12:44.340
I'll try to make this as
brief as possible, Penelope.


49
00:12:44.341 --> 00:12:45.841
Um, well, Penny.

50
00:12:47.341 --> 00:12:49.924
You can just call me Penny,
I mean, everyone does.


51
00:12:49.925 --> 00:12:50.758
Well--

52
00:12:52.718 --> 00:12:53.801
Everyone did.

53
00:12:55.383 --> 00:12:57.140
Okay then.

54
00:12:57.141 --> 00:12:58.141
Penny, uh--

55
00:12:59.302 --> 00:13:03.469
I'd like you to take a look
at this photo, if you will.


56
00:13:09.034 --> 00:13:11.784
Can you tell me, uh, who that is?

57
00:13:17.773 --> 00:13:18.606
Um--

58
00:13:21.554 --> 00:13:24.137
Yeah, that's him, that's the--

59
00:13:25.685 --> 00:13:28.102
That's the man that murdered,...

60
00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:31.337
...and killed all my friends,...

61
00:13:33.183 --> 00:13:35.350
...and that killed my fiance.

62
00:13:37.573 --> 00:13:39.906
The man I killed with an ax.

63
00:13:46.034 --> 00:13:50.449
Let the record show that
Miss Warren has identified...


64
00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:54.892
...Edward Wojowski, also
known as The Survivalist,...


65
00:13:54.893 --> 00:13:56.310
...as her assailant.

66
00:14:02.762 --> 00:14:03.679
Well, uh--

67
00:14:05.343 --> 00:14:09.822
I think that's all we're gonna
need from you, uh, today.


68
00:14:09.823 --> 00:14:13.990
There'll be a hearing regarding
the murder of Wojowski.


69
00:14:15.893 --> 00:14:20.092
I don't expect that
you'll be needed for that.


70
00:14:20.093 --> 00:14:20.926
Uh--

71
00:14:21.994 --> 00:14:24.041
Given the circumstances,...

72
00:14:24.042 --> 00:14:27.890
...I don't believe that
anyone would think that you...


73
00:14:27.891 --> 00:14:32.058
...acted, uh, in any way other
than your own self-defense.


74
00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:36.747
So I hope that now you can...

75
00:14:40.172 --> 00:14:44.339
...start to get past this and,
uh, move on with your life.


76
00:14:46.611 --> 00:14:47.444
How?

77
00:14:49.263 --> 00:14:50.930
I beg your pardon?

78
00:14:53.962 --> 00:14:58.129
How exactly am I supposed
to move on with my life?


79
00:14:59.332 --> 00:15:01.313
All my friends are dead.

80
00:15:01.314 --> 00:15:02.814
My fiance is dead.

81
00:15:03.834 --> 00:15:06.334
They were butchered by that--

82
00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:10.250
That maniac.

83
00:15:14.851 --> 00:15:17.434
Penny, uh, I look at you and,...

84
00:15:18.722 --> 00:15:19.805
...I can see it.

85
00:15:20.762 --> 00:15:22.262
You're a survivor.

86
00:15:28.770 --> 00:15:30.103
Apparently so.

87
00:16:31.232 --> 00:16:32.065
No, no.

88
00:16:33.762 --> 00:16:34.595
No!

89
00:16:35.642 --> 00:16:37.143
No, no, no.

90
00:16:37.144 --> 00:16:38.727
No, no, no, no, no.

91
00:16:44.861 --> 00:16:46.444
No no, no no no no.

92
00:16:47.613 --> 00:16:48.831
No.

93
00:17:15.241 --> 00:17:17.741
Tell me what you see, Penny.

94
00:17:20.322 --> 00:17:21.155
He's--

95
00:17:22.131 --> 00:17:22.964
He's tall.

96
00:17:25.882 --> 00:17:27.132
And he's angry.

97
00:17:28.453 --> 00:17:30.203
It's hard, I can't--

98
00:17:33.173 --> 00:17:34.006
I--

99
00:17:34.933 --> 00:17:38.766
There's so much blood
in my eyes, I can't see.


100
00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:43.740
He has a knife.

101
00:17:48.213 --> 00:17:49.046
I--

102
00:17:50.213 --> 00:17:52.546
I think he knows where I am.

103
00:17:54.813 --> 00:17:57.063
What, what are you doing?

104
00:18:01.493 --> 00:18:02.326
Nothing.

105
00:18:03.973 --> 00:18:06.140
I, I'm too scared to move.

106
00:18:12.299 --> 00:18:13.882
It's, it's so cold.

107
00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:19.413
I'm so hungry and my eye,...

108
00:18:21.431 --> 00:18:23.098
...my eye hurts so bad.

109
00:18:25.693 --> 00:18:28.193
You're vulnerable right now.

110
00:18:31.333 --> 00:18:32.750
Okay, let's talk.

111
00:18:34.911 --> 00:18:37.372
The effects of an experience
like this continues to...


112
00:18:37.373 --> 00:18:40.801
...undermine your own confidence, Penny.

113
00:18:40.802 --> 00:18:43.780
The violation you sustained
at the hands of Mr. Wojowski,...


114
00:18:43.781 --> 00:18:46.988
...well, this is something that
we'll surely be dealing with...


115
00:18:46.989 --> 00:18:49.201
...for quite some time.

116
00:18:49.202 --> 00:18:52.420
But in the end, we'll be
able to overcome it together.


117
00:18:52.421 --> 00:18:53.310
All right?

118
00:18:54.631 --> 00:18:56.928
Whatever you say.

119
00:18:56.929 --> 00:18:58.298
Okay, good.

120
00:18:58.299 --> 00:19:01.441
Now will I be able to
see you again, Friday?


121
00:19:01.442 --> 00:19:02.729
Okay.

122
00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:04.089
Thanks, doctor.

123
00:19:04.090 --> 00:19:04.923
Okay.

124
00:20:19.027 --> 00:20:19.860
No!

125
00:20:23.494 --> 00:20:24.327
No!

126
00:22:41.578 --> 00:22:43.958
Are we having more nightmares?

127
00:22:43.959 --> 00:22:44.876
Oh, yeah.

128
00:22:47.778 --> 00:22:48.695
You know--

129
00:22:49.687 --> 00:22:52.737
I thought they'd be
getting better by now.


130
00:22:52.738 --> 00:22:55.694
Well, these things take time.

131
00:22:55.695 --> 00:22:59.486
I'll give you a prescription,
something to help you sleep.


132
00:22:59.487 --> 00:23:00.737
Yeah, thanks.

133
00:23:01.818 --> 00:23:03.758
I mean, I think the hardest
thing that you're facing...


134
00:23:03.759 --> 00:23:06.166
...right now is how to
reinsert yourself...


135
00:23:06.167 --> 00:23:08.334
...into your old life, Penny.

136
00:23:12.079 --> 00:23:14.829
My old life is gone, Dr. Lentz.

137
00:23:16.269 --> 00:23:18.708
I mean, there must be something, surely.

138
00:23:18.709 --> 00:23:21.588
Have you tried
going back to work, uh,...


139
00:23:21.589 --> 00:23:24.639
...what is it exactly
that you do again?


140
00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:25.472
Um--

141
00:23:25.473 --> 00:23:27.933
♪ Our darlin' she's turned
into a savage ♪


142
00:23:27.934 --> 00:23:29.874
♪ She's a warrior ♪

143
00:23:29.875 --> 00:23:31.733
♪ There's no stopping her ♪

144
00:23:31.734 --> 00:23:33.761
♪ She's a warrior ♪

145
00:23:33.762 --> 00:23:37.973
♪ There's no stopping her ♪

146
00:23:37.974 --> 00:23:40.010
I was an entertainer.

147
00:23:40.011 --> 00:23:41.543
An entertainer.

148
00:23:41.544 --> 00:23:45.114
Well maybe that's
the medicine that we need.


149
00:23:45.115 --> 00:23:47.770
We're told today, the remains
of Edward Wojowski...


150
00:23:47.771 --> 00:23:50.583
...were laid to rest in
an unmarked grave.


151
00:23:50.584 --> 00:23:52.903
Potters Field will be
the final resting place...


152
00:23:52.904 --> 00:23:55.933
...of the man who terrorized
the one and a half million...


153
00:23:55.934 --> 00:23:59.234
...residents of the
greater Pittsburgh area.


154
00:23:59.235 --> 00:24:01.651
But the question on the minds
of the relieved people...


155
00:24:01.652 --> 00:24:04.602
...of this city is, who is
this woman who stopped...


156
00:24:04.603 --> 00:24:07.441
...the bloody trail of death
and suffering...


157
00:24:07.442 --> 00:24:09.903
...that The Survivalist blazed?

158
00:24:09.904 --> 00:24:12.891
Sources say the woman
is in her mid-20s,...


159
00:24:12.892 --> 00:24:14.863
...a local model and dancer.

160
00:24:14.864 --> 00:24:17.322
Little more is known about this
woman some Pittsburghers...


161
00:24:17.323 --> 00:24:20.522
...are calling a hero, but
rest assured, WPXX...


162
00:24:20.523 --> 00:24:22.802
...will continue searching for answers.

163
00:24:22.803 --> 00:24:24.594
This is Alicia Hayes reporting.

So tell me what you see.

192
00:27:26.787 --> 00:27:27.620
I--

193
00:27:28.552 --> 00:27:30.219
I can see the light.

194
00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:33.073
I can see it a little.

195
00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:35.103
But--

196
00:27:35.104 --> 00:27:35.937
Okay.

197
00:27:37.032 --> 00:27:38.119
I'm sorry, Penny,...

198
00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:42.492
...there was just too much damage
to the cornea and your iris.


199
00:27:42.493 --> 00:27:44.243
So then, that's it?

200
00:27:45.231 --> 00:27:46.561
Well, look at this way,...

201
00:27:46.562 --> 00:27:48.572
...you still have excellent
vision in your other eye.


202
00:27:48.573 --> 00:27:52.480
It's important to look at positive
things at a time like this.


203
00:27:52.481 --> 00:27:53.314
Yeah.

204
00:27:54.162 --> 00:27:54.995
Positive.

205
00:27:56.552 --> 00:28:00.623
Like, we can get rid of that crutch
and give you a knee brace.


206
00:28:00.624 --> 00:28:01.457
Great!

207
00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:03.273
Thank you.

208
00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:08.172
So how's it going with Dr. Lentz?

209
00:28:08.173 --> 00:28:11.942
Well, you know.

210
00:28:11.943 --> 00:28:12.860
It's going.

211
00:29:36.719 --> 00:29:37.758
Penny Warren?

212
00:29:37.759 --> 00:29:38.591
Yeah?

213
00:29:38.592 --> 00:29:41.337
Hi, I'm Alicia Hayes, WPXX News?

214
00:29:41.338 --> 00:29:43.857
I'm not interested
in giving any interviews.


215
00:29:43.858 --> 00:29:45.336
Look, I was just wondering if we could--

216
00:29:45.337 --> 00:29:47.496
No, no, no, I'm not.

217
00:29:47.497 --> 00:29:50.830
No, no interviews, just watch your hand.

218
00:29:54.018 --> 00:29:56.707
I'm just gonna leave my card
here for you, Penny!


219
00:29:56.708 --> 00:29:58.849
Just in case you want
someone to talk to!


220
00:29:58.850 --> 00:30:01.427
Lady, I have enough people...

221
00:30:01.428 --> 00:30:04.095
...that I have to
talk to as it is.

222
00:30:15.419 --> 00:30:17.408
I can't drive.

223
00:30:17.409 --> 00:30:18.492
I can't work.

224
00:30:19.419 --> 00:30:22.309
I can't, I can't even make a sandwich.

225
00:30:22.310 --> 00:30:23.143
Fuck.

226
00:30:24.117 --> 00:30:26.029
I don't have enough money
to pay for physical therapy...


227
00:30:26.030 --> 00:30:26.947
...for my leg.

228
00:30:28.438 --> 00:30:32.605
I don't even have enough
money to pay you, doctor.


229
00:30:34.157 --> 00:30:37.965
Edward Wojowski squatted
in the steel mill,...


230
00:30:37.966 --> 00:30:40.509
...and you know, he had no family.

231
00:30:40.510 --> 00:30:44.677
It's not like I can sue his
estate or anything, can I?


232
00:30:47.169 --> 00:30:51.336
There's just, everything
is just now, it's just me.


233
00:30:52.419 --> 00:30:53.752
I'm just, alone.

234
00:30:54.779 --> 00:30:56.029
You're angry.

235
00:31:01.049 --> 00:31:03.288
Well I'm glad all that money
towards your college degree...


236
00:31:03.289 --> 00:31:07.888
...didn't go wasted, doc, 'cause
you're fuckin' right I'm angry.


237
00:31:07.889 --> 00:31:10.709
That bastard took everything from me!

238
00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:12.293
He took everything!

239
00:31:13.539 --> 00:31:16.648
He took my vision, he took my leg.

240
00:31:16.649 --> 00:31:17.816
He took the--

241
00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:22.258
He took the only
man that I ever loved!

242
00:31:26.806 --> 00:31:28.326
God.

243
00:31:28.327 --> 00:31:31.098
And you know what,
doctor, you know what?


244
00:31:31.099 --> 00:31:33.826
Why, why did he leave me?

245
00:31:33.827 --> 00:31:35.826
Why didn't he kill me?

246
00:31:35.827 --> 00:31:39.175
'Cause this life wasn't meant for me.

247
00:31:39.176 --> 00:31:42.037
I wasn't supposed to deal with
all this shit 'cause my life...


248
00:31:42.038 --> 00:31:43.455
...wasn't this shit.

249
00:31:46.499 --> 00:31:47.332
Fuck.

250
00:31:49.659 --> 00:31:52.982
You should feel free to let it out.

251
00:31:52.983 --> 00:31:54.733
This is a safe place.

252
00:31:56.576 --> 00:31:57.993
Safe? Yeah, hm.

253
00:31:59.248 --> 00:32:01.967
I thought my house was
a safe place, doctor.


254
00:32:01.968 --> 00:32:04.127
I thought the woods was a safe place.

255
00:32:04.128 --> 00:32:04.960
You know what?

256
00:32:04.961 --> 00:32:07.596
Safety, there is no such thing
as a safe place, I mean,...


257
00:32:07.597 --> 00:32:10.764
...safety is just,
it's just an illusion.


258
00:32:12.245 --> 00:32:15.004
What I'm gonna do is prescribe
you something a little bit...


259
00:32:15.005 --> 00:32:18.822
...more powerful,
a more powerful dosage.


260
00:32:18.823 --> 00:32:22.072
You need time, you need
time to heal yourself,...


261
00:32:22.073 --> 00:32:24.102
...to heal your psyche.

262
00:32:24.103 --> 00:32:24.936
Yeah.

263
00:32:31.496 --> 00:32:32.329
Thanks.

264
00:32:45.179 --> 00:32:46.012
Shit!

265
00:33:31.223 --> 00:33:32.999
Hello, Penny.

266
00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:36.470
Oh god, lady, do
you not get the hint?

267
00:33:36.471 --> 00:33:39.245
Well if I did, then I wouldn't be very
good at my job now, would I?


268
00:33:40.239 --> 00:33:41.160
Hey, I just wanted--

269
00:33:41.161 --> 00:33:42.589
Jesus.

270
00:33:42.590 --> 00:33:44.799
Don't fuckin' touch me.

271
00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:47.840
Now you listen to me and you listen
to me real fuckin' good,...


272
00:33:47.841 --> 00:33:52.662
...news lady, now is the time
for you to start backing off.


273
00:33:52.663 --> 00:33:53.496
Okay?

274
00:33:55.590 --> 00:33:57.590
But people wanna know!

275
00:33:58.479 --> 00:33:59.462
What?

276
00:33:59.463 --> 00:34:01.720
What do they exactly wanna know?

277
00:34:01.721 --> 00:34:04.011
Do they wanna know how it feels
to have everybody that you...


278
00:34:04.012 --> 00:34:06.040
...care about butchered?

279
00:34:06.041 --> 00:34:09.171
Or maybe they wanna know how
it feels to have to go through...


280
00:34:09.172 --> 00:34:13.339
...the rest of your life
looking like a fuckin' freak.


281
00:34:15.241 --> 00:34:18.574
I planted an ax
in a guy's skull, bitch.

282
00:34:20.303 --> 00:34:23.302
So maybe that should be
a hint to you,...


283
00:34:23.303 --> 00:34:25.553
...to leave me the fuck alone.

284
00:34:36.583 --> 00:34:39.916
I planted an ax
in a guy's skull, bitch.

285
00:35:09.947 --> 00:35:11.364
No, no no, no no.

286
00:36:18.770 --> 00:36:20.437
So what do we got?

287
00:36:21.274 --> 00:36:23.903
Look familiar?

288
00:36:23.904 --> 00:36:25.492
Did you check her back?

289
00:36:25.493 --> 00:36:28.841
Um, not yet, I wanted you
to see her before I moved her.


290
00:36:28.842 --> 00:36:31.532
No scrapes on the back
of her ankles or her legs...


291
00:36:31.533 --> 00:36:33.200
...that I can see here.

292
00:36:35.690 --> 00:36:37.303
What do you think?

293
00:36:37.304 --> 00:36:39.583
Did you check to see if there's
any defensive wounds...


294
00:36:39.584 --> 00:36:41.761
...on the arms or hands?

295
00:36:41.762 --> 00:36:43.153
Nothin' even under her nails.

296
00:36:43.154 --> 00:36:44.623
I know, I can't figure it out.

297
00:36:44.624 --> 00:36:46.252
She let somebody do this?

298
00:36:46.253 --> 00:36:48.721
It's happened the same way.

299
00:36:48.722 --> 00:36:50.433
I mean, look at the body positioning.

300
00:36:50.434 --> 00:36:53.730
Everything is the same as the last time.

301
00:36:53.731 --> 00:36:57.369
And my question is, if
that's not Wojowski,...


302
00:36:57.370 --> 00:37:00.953
...then who the hell are
we dealing with here?


303
00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:07.753
Coming.

304
00:37:16.910 --> 00:37:18.946
Oh, Detective--

305
00:37:18.947 --> 00:37:20.090
Mosser.

306
00:37:20.091 --> 00:37:21.424
Mosser, sorry.

307
00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:24.537
Um.

308
00:37:24.538 --> 00:37:26.439
Come in, come in.

309
00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:27.273
Thanks.

310
00:37:28.498 --> 00:37:29.331
Um.

311
00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:31.777
I was just, um--

312
00:37:33.655 --> 00:37:35.923
Oh, do you want some
coffee or something?


313
00:37:35.924 --> 00:37:39.235
Sure, that'd be great, thanks.

314
00:37:39.236 --> 00:37:41.903
Just give me a second.

315
00:37:48.721 --> 00:37:50.731
This is a nice place.

316
00:37:50.732 --> 00:37:53.399
So uh, how are you doing, Penny?

317
00:37:56.023 --> 00:37:57.102
The truth?

318
00:37:57.103 --> 00:37:58.523
Of course.

319
00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:03.237
Pretty fuckin' bad.

320
00:38:04.501 --> 00:38:06.499
Well I'm sorry.

321
00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:08.832
It's a hell of a thing.

322
00:38:08.833 --> 00:38:13.000
You took a man's life, right
or wrong, it changes you.


323
00:38:15.491 --> 00:38:16.908
It changes you.

324
00:38:18.743 --> 00:38:22.051
My first year as a detective.

325
00:38:22.052 --> 00:38:23.802
Domestic disturbance.

326
00:38:24.793 --> 00:38:28.712
You know, more police officers
are injured on domestics...


327
00:38:28.713 --> 00:38:31.046
...than any other type of call?

328
00:38:32.313 --> 00:38:34.396
No, I didn't know that.

329
00:38:35.371 --> 00:38:36.531
What happened?

330
00:38:36.532 --> 00:38:37.365
Well--

331
00:38:38.571 --> 00:38:41.170
That's not important anymore.

332
00:38:41.171 --> 00:38:44.003
People were in danger,
I had a choice to make...


333
00:38:44.004 --> 00:38:47.283
...and I made it, simple as that.

334
00:38:47.284 --> 00:38:49.059
I'd do it again if I had to.

335
00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:51.560
Well, I think I'd do it again.

336
00:38:53.884 --> 00:38:54.801
So, um--

337
00:38:56.393 --> 00:38:58.893
Oh, I'm sorry, did you come--

338
00:38:59.772 --> 00:39:03.010
Did you need anything from me?

339
00:39:03.011 --> 00:39:06.902
I didn't know if I forgot
to call you or, did you--


340
00:39:06.903 --> 00:39:09.570
Penny, we found a girl's body,...

341
00:39:10.924 --> 00:39:14.341
...up in the woods
on the hill this morning.


342
00:39:15.553 --> 00:39:16.782
By the reservoir.

343
00:39:16.783 --> 00:39:19.783
We haven't, uh, 
IDed the girl yet,...

344
00:39:20.703 --> 00:39:24.870
...but she was stripped naked
and killed with a survival knife.


345
00:39:26.143 --> 00:39:29.622
Just, um--

346
00:39:29.623 --> 00:39:30.899
Just like--

347
00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:35.459
Yeah, the trouble is, what's
left of Edward Wojowski is...


348
00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:38.352
...in an urn in the Potters Field.

349
00:39:38.353 --> 00:39:40.603
I know, I saw him cremated.

350
00:39:42.884 --> 00:39:45.384
So what are you saying then?

351
00:39:46.303 --> 00:39:48.259
We're just not sure.

352
00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:52.102
There's been a lot of media
coverage of these events.


353
00:39:52.103 --> 00:39:54.270
Sometimes we get copycats.

354
00:39:55.901 --> 00:39:58.734
People looking to grab a headline.

355
00:40:00.060 --> 00:40:03.890
The other possibility
is that Edward Wojowski...


356
00:40:03.891 --> 00:40:05.724
...was not working alone.

357
00:40:07.364 --> 00:40:11.700
That he had some kind of
a partner on the outside.


358
00:40:11.701 --> 00:40:13.963
We just don't know.

359
00:40:18.383 --> 00:40:19.800
Well there's--

360
00:40:20.913 --> 00:40:22.080
There's, um--

361
00:40:24.491 --> 00:40:26.824
I'm sorry, detective, I'm--

362
00:40:29.193 --> 00:40:32.110
I'm not, I'm not feeling that well.

363
00:40:43.698 --> 00:40:44.715
Penny.

364
00:40:44.716 --> 00:40:46.799
Penny, are you all right?

365
00:40:48.916 --> 00:40:49.749
Yeah.

366
00:40:51.793 --> 00:40:55.035
I'm fine, detective, I'm
just not feeling that good.


367
00:40:55.036 --> 00:40:58.046
Can I call someone for you?

368
00:40:58.047 --> 00:40:59.286
There's no one left to call.

369
00:40:59.287 --> 00:41:00.287
I'm sorry?

370
00:41:01.193 --> 00:41:02.026
Um.

371
00:41:03.137 --> 00:41:06.416
Nothing, can you just
make sure that the door...


372
00:41:06.417 --> 00:41:08.584
...is locked on your way out?

373
00:41:10.857 --> 00:41:11.690
I'll--

374
00:41:13.036 --> 00:41:16.114
Can I call and check on your tomorrow?

375
00:41:16.115 --> 00:41:19.206
I feel bad leaving you like this.

376
00:41:19.207 --> 00:41:21.064
Okay, um, great, thanks.

377
00:41:21.065 --> 00:41:23.815
Yeah, I'll talk to your tomorrow.

378
00:41:26.394 --> 00:41:27.227
I'll--

379
00:41:28.407 --> 00:41:30.324
You, uh, you take care.

380
00:42:05.117 --> 00:42:05.950
Shit.

381
00:42:10.728 --> 00:42:12.846
The city of Pittsburgh is
breathing a sigh of relief...


382
00:42:12.847 --> 00:42:16.206
...this week knowing that one of
its most dangerous denizens,...


383
00:42:16.207 --> 00:42:19.588
...Edward "The Survivalist"
Wojowski, is dead.


384
00:42:19.589 --> 00:42:22.535
This is the steel mill where
Wojowski ate, slept...


385
00:42:22.536 --> 00:42:24.337
...and tortured his victims.

386
00:42:24.338 --> 00:42:27.215
Now police are not letting any
reporters into the building,...


387
00:42:27.216 --> 00:42:30.655
...but here at WPXX, we've
gained exclusive information...


388
00:42:30.656 --> 00:42:33.336
...regarding the woman who
some are referring to as...


389
00:42:33.337 --> 00:42:35.268
...the one who got away.

390
00:42:35.269 --> 00:42:36.937
This is the home of Penny Warren,...

391
00:42:36.938 --> 00:42:39.446
...who would have been
The Survivalist's ninth victim,...


392
00:42:39.447 --> 00:42:41.439
...before her daring escape
last Tuesday...


393
00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:44.455
...during which she managed
to kill her captor with an ax.


394
00:42:44.456 --> 00:42:46.655
I attempted to interview
Miss Warren the other day,...


395
00:42:46.656 --> 00:42:49.977
...but found her unwilling to
talk about the recent events.


396
00:42:49.978 --> 00:42:52.775
Evidently, this is a woman
who is still dealing...


397
00:42:52.776 --> 00:42:55.057
...with the trauma from recent events.

398
00:42:55.058 --> 00:42:59.167
And now, we have unconfirmed
reports that another body...


399
00:42:59.168 --> 00:43:02.177
...has been found in
the woods in Mount Oliver.


400
00:43:02.178 --> 00:43:04.628
It's obvious that this is
a story whose conclusion...


401
00:43:04.629 --> 00:43:06.377
...has yet to be decided.

402
00:43:06.378 --> 00:43:09.239
Until then, we'll be working
to keep you informed.


403
00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:11.240
Alicia Hayes, WPXX News.

404
00:43:54.779 --> 00:43:58.968
You know, I really hate to see you
withdrawn like this, Penny.


405
00:44:00.227 --> 00:44:03.138
I don't know, doctor, I've been--

406
00:44:03.139 --> 00:44:07.328
I think after all I've been
through and, you know,...


407
00:44:07.329 --> 00:44:10.538
...all the killings and stuff,
like, maybe,...


408
00:44:10.539 --> 00:44:13.048
...maybe it changed me, somehow.

409
00:44:13.049 --> 00:44:17.216
Well, you are who you are
and nothing can change that.


410
00:44:18.219 --> 00:44:22.186
I don't know, I've been
having these dreams,...


411
00:44:22.187 --> 00:44:24.270
...like, these awful dreams.

412
00:44:26.299 --> 00:44:29.114
And my temper, 
I'm just so angry.

413
00:44:29.115 --> 00:44:30.914
Well, well of course you're angry.

414
00:44:30.915 --> 00:44:33.234
I mean, your life has been
turned upside down,...


415
00:44:33.235 --> 00:44:36.077
...and as far as the rest,
your body's adjusting...


416
00:44:36.078 --> 00:44:39.586
...to the medication and you know,
these things take time...


417
00:44:39.587 --> 00:44:41.754
...and we will work them out.

418
00:44:42.859 --> 00:44:47.033
You know, the world has a lot
to offer, and I'm afraid that...


419
00:44:47.034 --> 00:44:50.065
...you're missing out on some
of these things, and uh,...


420
00:44:50.066 --> 00:44:53.457
...despite what you think, you're
a young and attractive woman...


421
00:44:53.458 --> 00:44:57.235
...and uh, I'm sure that there's
something out there for you.


422
00:45:04.807 --> 00:45:06.435
Penny?

423
00:45:10.266 --> 00:45:11.099
Penny?

424
00:52:17.938 --> 00:52:19.124
Hello?

425
00:52:19.125 --> 00:52:21.247
Penny, it's Dr. Lentz.

426
00:52:21.248 --> 00:52:23.687
Uh, you missed your appointment
this morning,...


427
00:52:23.688 --> 00:52:27.395
...and I was wondering if
uh, everything was okay.


428
00:52:27.396 --> 00:52:29.036
I'm a little concerned.

429
00:52:29.037 --> 00:52:31.348
No, doctor.

430
00:52:31.349 --> 00:52:33.849
Everything is most definitely,...

431
00:52:34.808 --> 00:52:35.975
...not all right.

432
00:52:37.328 --> 00:52:40.687
Well, if you feel better about coming
over here to see me,...


433
00:52:40.688 --> 00:52:42.795
...or I can come to see you--

434
00:52:42.796 --> 00:52:44.164
I...

435
00:52:44.165 --> 00:52:46.807
I think it's best if you just--

436
00:52:46.808 --> 00:52:49.367
If you just stay away from me.

437
00:52:49.368 --> 00:52:52.708
Well Penny, I could be there, like,
in around 10 minutes if you want--


438
00:52:52.709 --> 00:52:54.209
Goodbye, doctor.

439
00:55:04.766 --> 00:55:08.599
Penny, you didn't answer
my call last night.


440
00:55:10.454 --> 00:55:12.376
How'd you know I was here, detective?

441
00:55:12.377 --> 00:55:14.307
Please, call me Jake.

442
00:55:14.308 --> 00:55:15.141
Okay.

443
00:55:15.977 --> 00:55:17.925
How'd you know I was here, Jake?

444
00:55:17.926 --> 00:55:20.885
Now, I don't want you to take
this the wrong way.


445
00:55:20.886 --> 00:55:24.645
Oh god, please don't tell me
that you're following me.


446
00:55:24.646 --> 00:55:27.696
Penny, I just wanted to be sure
that you're okay.


447
00:55:27.697 --> 00:55:29.717
After what I've been through?

448
00:55:29.718 --> 00:55:32.307
You don't think I have enough
reasons to be paranoid?


449
00:55:32.308 --> 00:55:33.225
I just--

450
00:55:34.148 --> 00:55:36.975
I did it because I was
worried about you.


451
00:55:36.976 --> 00:55:39.135
Whoever killed these girls--

452
00:55:39.136 --> 00:55:40.787
I gotta go.

453
00:55:40.788 --> 00:55:41.805
Penny, wait.

454
00:55:43.745 --> 00:55:44.577
No, no.

455
00:55:44.578 --> 00:55:45.851
Fuckin' get away from me!

456
00:55:50.182 --> 00:55:51.265
Let go of me!

457
00:55:52.341 --> 00:55:54.084
Why me, Jake?

458
00:55:54.085 --> 00:55:55.700
- Let me give you a ride home.
- No, no!


459
00:55:55.701 --> 00:55:56.868
You answer me.

460
00:55:58.813 --> 00:56:02.004
There is a maniac out
there killing girls,...


461
00:56:02.005 --> 00:56:03.922
...and you're stalking me?

462
00:56:05.301 --> 00:56:08.420
Look at me, I'm
a mangled ex-stripper,...


463
00:56:08.421 --> 00:56:10.633
...with a gimp leg, I can't work.

464
00:56:10.634 --> 00:56:13.332
I gotta ride god-damn public
transportation on top of...


465
00:56:13.333 --> 00:56:15.750
...all of that, 
I got some major...

466
00:56:17.845 --> 00:56:18.928
...anger issues.

467
00:56:20.704 --> 00:56:24.031
As you, might be able to tell.

468
00:56:24.032 --> 00:56:24.949
So, uh--

469
00:56:26.325 --> 00:56:27.492
Is that a yes?

470
00:56:43.697 --> 00:56:46.840
I know that reporter lady's
been harassing you.


471
00:56:46.841 --> 00:56:49.400
I'll see what I can do
to get her to quit.


472
00:56:49.401 --> 00:56:50.401
Good luck.

473
00:56:52.681 --> 00:56:55.431
She's almost as tenacious as you.

474
00:56:59.452 --> 00:57:04.525
You know, it seems like everybody
is trying to help me, but--


475
00:57:07.532 --> 00:57:09.199
The more they try--

476
00:57:14.052 --> 00:57:15.135
I don't know.

477
00:57:16.129 --> 00:57:19.392
I don't want anything from you, Penny.

478
00:57:19.393 --> 00:57:21.893
I don't have an angle, really.

479
00:57:22.812 --> 00:57:23.645
I just--

480
00:57:25.313 --> 00:57:26.396
Just, just--

481
00:57:27.513 --> 00:57:29.180
Want you to be okay.

482
00:57:37.481 --> 00:57:40.648
There's something that you should see.

483
00:57:56.083 --> 00:57:56.980
What?

484
00:57:56.981 --> 00:57:58.064
This is it.

485
00:58:00.753 --> 00:58:01.962
What's it?

486
00:58:01.963 --> 00:58:04.463
Where they buried his ashes.

487
00:58:15.731 --> 00:58:17.481
It's over now, Penny.

488
00:58:21.302 --> 00:58:26.339
Now you can...
Move on with your life.


489
00:58:59.214 --> 00:59:01.272
I found out the victim's name.

490
00:59:01.273 --> 00:59:03.060
Megan Shamonski.

491
00:59:03.061 --> 00:59:05.060
Turns it she works at The Cricket.

492
00:59:05.061 --> 00:59:08.762
Danced under the name Sunny St. Claire.

493
00:59:08.763 --> 00:59:09.989
Stripper.

494
00:59:09.990 --> 00:59:13.200
Well, it fits The Survivalist's profile.

495
00:59:13.201 --> 00:59:15.064
Yeah, more than you know.

496
00:59:15.065 --> 00:59:17.311
Guess who else worked at The Cricket.

497
00:59:17.312 --> 00:59:19.062
Guess who knew Sunny.

498
00:59:20.763 --> 00:59:21.680
Oh, shit.

499
00:59:22.734 --> 00:59:23.567
Jake.

500
00:59:24.494 --> 00:59:26.402
This Warren girl.

501
00:59:26.403 --> 00:59:28.682
She's caught up in something
that's far from being over...


502
00:59:28.683 --> 00:59:30.600
...and the fact that you're seeing her--

503
00:59:30.601 --> 00:59:33.601
I'm just...
I'm looking out for her, Kim.


504
00:59:33.602 --> 00:59:34.824
She's been through hell.

505
00:59:34.825 --> 00:59:37.908
Everybody she knows is dead, she's--

506
00:59:38.803 --> 00:59:41.071
She's all alone out there.

507
00:59:41.072 --> 00:59:42.962
You understand that, right?

508
00:59:42.963 --> 00:59:44.061
No.

509
00:59:44.062 --> 00:59:44.895
I don't.

510
00:59:45.763 --> 00:59:47.576
And what if she's
more involved in this...


511
00:59:47.577 --> 00:59:49.512
...than either of us know?

512
00:59:49.513 --> 00:59:50.346
What then?

513
00:59:51.475 --> 00:59:55.432
I mean, god, she could be
so messed up in the head...


514
00:59:55.433 --> 00:59:59.223
...she doesn't even know
what she's doing anymore.


515
00:59:59.224 --> 01:00:02.392
And what if she's acting out,...

516
01:00:02.393 --> 01:00:05.434
...everything that happened to her?

517
01:00:05.435 --> 01:00:06.935
Well then, uh--

518
01:00:08.777 --> 01:00:09.944
I guess I'd--

519
01:00:12.035 --> 01:00:14.512
Be the first to know.

520
01:00:14.513 --> 01:00:15.346
Won't I?

521
01:00:23.035 --> 01:00:24.696
Oh hey, how are you doing?

522
01:00:45.672 --> 01:00:48.169
It was nice of your mom...

523
01:00:48.170 --> 01:00:50.740
...to let you borrow her car.

524
01:00:50.741 --> 01:00:54.271
Come on, I get 400 miles
to the gallon in this thing.


525
01:00:54.272 --> 01:00:57.355
I told you, I can't handle tequila.

526
01:01:23.309 --> 01:01:24.142
Fuck.

527
01:01:28.843 --> 01:01:29.922
I'm sorry.

528
01:01:29.923 --> 01:01:30.756
I can't.

529
01:01:35.152 --> 01:01:36.788
It's--

530
01:01:36.789 --> 01:01:38.588
It's all right.

531
01:01:38.589 --> 01:01:40.839
Fuck you, it's all right!

532
01:01:48.352 --> 01:01:49.352
I'm sorry.

533
01:01:51.701 --> 01:01:53.868
Stay away from me, Jake.

534
01:01:54.973 --> 01:01:58.390
Stay away from me
or we'll both be sorry.


535
01:01:59.949 --> 01:02:00.782
I mean it.

536
01:02:02.843 --> 01:02:03.676
Go!

537
01:05:48.533 --> 01:05:50.543
Obvious that Penny Warren
knows more about this...


538
01:05:50.544 --> 01:05:52.034
...than has been revealed.

539
01:05:52.035 --> 01:05:54.805
This reporter wonders why
the police are just allowing...


540
01:05:54.806 --> 01:05:58.141
...a material witness to withhold
such potentially valuable...


541
01:05:58.142 --> 01:05:59.853
...information.

542
01:05:59.854 --> 01:06:02.714
Lieutenant Jake Mosser, the
detective in charge of the...


543
01:06:02.715 --> 01:06:06.681
...ongoing investigation even
contacted me earlier this week...


544
01:06:06.682 --> 01:06:10.849
...and pressured me to abandon
WPXX's reporting on the subject.


545
01:06:12.612 --> 01:06:15.330
More young people are dying, detective.

546
01:06:15.331 --> 01:06:18.813
Instead of covering it up, you
need to bring in this woman...


547
01:06:18.814 --> 01:06:21.903
...and do whatever it takes
to find out what she knows...


548
01:06:21.904 --> 01:06:23.737
...about this new murder.

549
01:06:47.935 --> 01:06:48.886
Penny?

550
01:06:48.887 --> 01:06:51.225
Did you watch the news
tonight, Dr. Lentz?


551
01:06:51.226 --> 01:06:54.406
Yes, I saw it but uh, you really
shouldn't take much stock...


552
01:06:54.407 --> 01:06:57.414
...in what a TV reporter has to say.

553
01:06:57.415 --> 01:06:58.502
You know they're just after--

554
01:06:58.503 --> 01:07:00.420
No, um, I wanna know,...

555
01:07:02.574 --> 01:07:05.065
...do you think there's
a part of me that died...


556
01:07:05.066 --> 01:07:07.425
...along with my friends?

557
01:07:07.426 --> 01:07:08.784
The good part of me.

558
01:07:08.785 --> 01:07:11.173
Penny, you have to realize
that there's a lot of guilt...


559
01:07:11.174 --> 01:07:14.326
...that's associated with when
someone survives an incident...


560
01:07:14.327 --> 01:07:15.915
...where others die.

561
01:07:15.916 --> 01:07:17.166
You know that, don't you?

562
01:07:17.167 --> 01:07:18.084
Bullshit!

563
01:07:19.047 --> 01:07:20.262
Bullshit.

564
01:07:20.263 --> 01:07:24.044
I don't want any of your psychological
PhD opinion crap, okay?


565
01:07:25.076 --> 01:07:27.076
I wanna, I wanna know...

566
01:07:28.306 --> 01:07:31.253
...if someone kills another person,...

567
01:07:31.254 --> 01:07:34.171
...if something inside
of them breaks,...


568
01:07:35.276 --> 01:07:38.542
...that allows them to go and kill...

569
01:07:38.543 --> 01:07:41.334
...someone else again and again.

570
01:07:41.335 --> 01:07:45.342
Penny, are you taking your medication?

571
01:07:45.343 --> 01:07:46.176
Penny?

572
01:07:47.226 --> 01:07:48.173
Penny?

573
01:07:48.174 --> 01:07:49.342
Never mind.

574
01:07:49.343 --> 01:07:51.593
Sorry I called you so late.

575
01:07:54.767 --> 01:07:56.406
Penny?

576
01:07:56.407 --> 01:07:57.240
Penny!

577
01:08:04.493 --> 01:08:06.663
No, Steven, I think it's
a perfectly worthwhile...


578
01:08:06.664 --> 01:08:09.331
...allocation of my time, actually.

579
01:08:22.035 --> 01:08:24.092
Well I think it's a good idea because...

580
01:08:24.093 --> 01:08:25.924
...no one else is going after her,...

581
01:08:25.925 --> 01:08:30.092
...and if I can land this, I can
scoop Channel 4 and WPPG.


582
01:08:38.464 --> 01:08:40.484
Well tell Lou and the others
that they're fucking pussies...


583
01:08:40.485 --> 01:08:41.764
...and they need to strap it on...

584
01:08:41.765 --> 01:08:44.924
...if they wanna play
with the big kids, okay?


585
01:08:44.925 --> 01:08:47.260
Okay.

586
01:08:47.261 --> 01:08:49.703
Well I'm gonna go take a shower.

587
01:08:49.704 --> 01:08:52.703
Yes, Steven, I'll be naked.

588
01:08:52.704 --> 01:08:55.871
That's how people take showers, naked.

589
01:08:58.024 --> 01:08:58.857
Freak.

590
01:09:56.429 --> 01:10:00.096
You?

591
01:11:02.850 --> 01:11:04.206
Penny!

592
01:11:04.207 --> 01:11:06.318
Penny, I know you're there.

593
01:11:06.319 --> 01:11:08.408
Will you just answer on the phone?

594
01:11:08.409 --> 01:11:12.159
Penny, something's happened,
we need to talk.


595
01:11:14.631 --> 01:11:16.641
Penny, Alicia Hayes was
killed last night.


596
01:11:16.642 --> 01:11:17.921
They're gonna make me bring you in...

597
01:11:17.922 --> 01:11:21.339
...if you don't talk to
Detective Hatherton.


598
01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.023
Where's Detective Mosser?

599
01:11:35.024 --> 01:11:39.191
Oh, he's not doing this
interview, Miss Warren, I am.


600
01:11:41.322 --> 01:11:42.322
God, okay.

601
01:11:43.693 --> 01:11:47.234
You know what? I really
don't need to see that, I get it.


602
01:11:47.235 --> 01:11:50.092
Look, Penny, you've been
through a hell of an ordeal.


603
01:11:50.093 --> 01:11:51.343
I get it, I do.

604
01:11:52.533 --> 01:11:54.532
But there are people dying out
there and they're people...


605
01:11:54.533 --> 01:11:58.234
...that you have crossed paths
with and you have no alibi...


606
01:11:58.235 --> 01:11:59.674
...for either night.

607
01:11:59.675 --> 01:12:01.514
So what I need from you,...

608
01:12:01.515 --> 01:12:04.412
...is a reason why I shouldn't
think you're completely crazy,...


609
01:12:04.413 --> 01:12:08.413
...and that you're not
responsible for all of this.


610
01:12:24.450 --> 01:12:25.283
Jesus.

611
01:12:42.086 --> 01:12:43.419
All right, well.

612
01:12:44.457 --> 01:12:46.984
So, am I under arrest?

613
01:12:46.985 --> 01:12:50.435
Not technically, no, but you
are a person of interest...


614
01:12:50.436 --> 01:12:53.423
...in an ongoing investigation.

615
01:12:54.337 --> 01:12:56.576
Okay then, well.

616
01:12:56.577 --> 01:12:57.910
I'm out of here.

617
01:13:06.225 --> 01:13:07.225
Hatherton.

618
01:13:41.002 --> 01:13:42.772
You gotta suck it up, sister,...

619
01:13:42.773 --> 01:13:46.606
...or you'll never make it
through all this shit.


620
01:13:48.333 --> 01:13:49.500
Who's there?

621
01:13:50.602 --> 01:13:52.185
I think you know.

622
01:14:01.642 --> 01:14:02.475
Oh, god.

623
01:14:04.162 --> 01:14:05.245
Just get out.

624
01:14:06.109 --> 01:14:07.359
Leave me alone!

625
01:14:08.373 --> 01:14:11.508
I think you know that's impossible.

626
01:14:11.509 --> 01:14:14.926
I can't leave, because
I'm a part of you.


627
01:14:27.802 --> 01:14:28.635
No.

628
01:14:30.035 --> 01:14:32.118
No, no, no you're not me.

629
01:14:33.202 --> 01:14:34.035
You're--

630
01:14:35.104 --> 01:14:37.437
You're not me, you're a lie!

631
01:14:40.922 --> 01:14:41.922
No, Penny.

632
01:14:43.864 --> 01:14:45.864
I'm the only real truth.

633
01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:50.300
Open your eyes and you'll see,...

634
01:14:51.352 --> 01:14:54.685
...I'm the part of you
that you can't face.


635
01:14:58.213 --> 01:15:02.761
I'm the one that got you
through all this blood...


636
01:15:02.762 --> 01:15:05.762
...and all the shit,
and all the death.


637
01:15:09.352 --> 01:15:10.435
Take my hand.

638
01:15:12.333 --> 01:15:13.166
Why?

639
01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:17.079
Why are you here?

640
01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:18.163
I told you.

641
01:15:19.064 --> 01:15:20.599
I'm here to free you.

642
01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:22.350
Free me to do what?

643
01:15:23.682 --> 01:15:26.143
To fulfill your destiny.

644
01:15:26.144 --> 01:15:30.144
There's work to be done
and I can't do it alone.


645
01:15:45.777 --> 01:15:48.359
You've been suffering for weeks.

646
01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:50.193
You must be exhausted.

647
01:15:58.370 --> 01:15:59.370
Don't worry.

648
01:16:00.759 --> 01:16:03.759
I know how to
make the pain go away.

649
01:16:10.390 --> 01:16:11.223
Yeah.

650
01:16:15.250 --> 01:16:16.083
So do I.

651
01:16:32.647 --> 01:16:33.766
Hello, Dr. Lentz.

652
01:16:33.767 --> 01:16:35.116
Jesus Christ!

653
01:16:35.117 --> 01:16:36.864
Penny, you scared me!

654
01:16:36.865 --> 01:16:38.264
What are you doing here?

655
01:16:41.578 --> 01:16:44.006
You left your door unlocked.

656
01:16:44.007 --> 01:16:45.953
That's a very dangerous
thing to do, I mean,...


657
01:16:45.954 --> 01:16:47.864
...anybody could have
came walkin' in here.


658
01:16:47.865 --> 01:16:49.584
Well, at least I'm glad it's you,...

659
01:16:49.585 --> 01:16:51.206
...but what are you doing here?

660
01:16:51.207 --> 01:16:53.385
I don't understand. Did we have
an appointment or something?


661
01:16:53.386 --> 01:16:55.273
I don't, I don't get this.

662
01:16:55.274 --> 01:16:58.357
You see, I have
come to a point of,...

663
01:17:00.275 --> 01:17:01.692
...self-realization.

664
01:17:02.567 --> 01:17:04.777
Penny, you need help.

665
01:17:04.778 --> 01:17:06.028
That's right.

666
01:17:08.546 --> 01:17:11.206
Everybody wants to help me.

667
01:17:11.207 --> 01:17:14.457
Penny, this is not, this is not good.

668
01:17:15.847 --> 01:17:16.680
Here.

669
01:17:18.634 --> 01:17:20.276
Penny, you can't quit
these cold turkey,...


670
01:17:20.277 --> 01:17:21.704
...they're too strong!

671
01:17:21.705 --> 01:17:25.017
Without, you know, side-effects?

672
01:17:25.018 --> 01:17:26.326
Headaches and nausea,...

673
01:17:26.327 --> 01:17:29.286
...and irritability and anxiety,
oh I know.


674
01:17:29.287 --> 01:17:31.766
- Trust me, I know.
- Penny, Penny, please.


675
01:17:31.767 --> 01:17:32.600
Please.

676
01:17:33.687 --> 01:17:36.873
I decided I needed my own life back.

677
01:17:36.874 --> 01:17:41.777
I decided I needed to tell
what was real and what wasn't.


678
01:17:41.778 --> 01:17:43.745
Penny, I don't understand.

679
01:17:48.997 --> 01:17:54.681
I can't believe it took me
this long to figure.. out!


680
01:17:56.559 --> 01:17:58.929
You and your fuckin' drugs!

681
01:17:58.930 --> 01:18:01.013
You killed that reporter!

682
01:18:02.068 --> 01:18:04.259
She had a big mouth.

683
01:18:04.260 --> 01:18:06.598
She was putting everything
together anyways.


684
01:18:06.599 --> 01:18:09.307
She was gonna figure things out.

685
01:18:10.770 --> 01:18:12.049
Yeah.

686
01:18:12.050 --> 01:18:14.049
And what did Sunny do to you?

687
01:18:14.050 --> 01:18:15.919
Why did you kill her?

688
01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:18.897
- Why did you kill any of them?
- Stop it.


689
01:18:18.898 --> 01:18:22.577
I had to do it, 
I had to kill them.

690
01:18:22.578 --> 01:18:25.609
They were putting things together
like that bitch detective.


691
01:18:25.610 --> 01:18:28.217
She had to learn how to mind
her own fucking business.


692
01:18:29.529 --> 01:18:31.446
Please stop hitting me.

693
01:18:32.340 --> 01:18:34.121
Why me? Why me?

694
01:18:34.122 --> 01:18:35.091
Tell me, why me?

695
01:18:35.092 --> 01:18:37.993
After everything I've
been through, why me!


696
01:18:41.308 --> 01:18:42.864
Stop it.

697
01:18:42.865 --> 01:18:44.304
Please.

698
01:18:44.305 --> 01:18:47.755
Give me some god-damn answers...
And maybe I'll think about it!


699
01:18:47.756 --> 01:18:51.923
I will, will, just please, please
stop fucking hurting me.


700
01:19:05.185 --> 01:19:07.493
I was Wojowski's doctor.

701
01:19:07.494 --> 01:19:09.453
He came to me four years ago.

702
01:19:09.454 --> 01:19:12.195
I tried to keep him off the books.

703
01:19:12.196 --> 01:19:15.779
He was perfect for what
I was trying to do.


704
01:19:16.854 --> 01:19:19.271
He was like clay in my hands.

705
01:19:20.705 --> 01:19:25.182
He had been abused his
entire childhood, and--


706
01:19:25.183 --> 01:19:28.445
I had always wondered
what all that anger...


707
01:19:28.446 --> 01:19:32.565
...would be like in that powerful
huge individual like him.


708
01:19:32.566 --> 01:19:35.984
Would there be an outlet for it.

709
01:19:35.985 --> 01:19:38.068
And you gave it to him.

710
01:19:39.326 --> 01:19:41.326
You gave him my friends.

711
01:19:42.246 --> 01:19:43.079
And me.

712
01:19:45.956 --> 01:19:47.835
I needed to know.

713
01:19:47.836 --> 01:19:50.515
Medicine needed to know.

714
01:19:50.516 --> 01:19:52.613
What makes someone kill.

715
01:19:52.614 --> 01:19:56.013
Is it a switch that
you pull off and on?

716
01:19:56.014 --> 01:19:56.847
Is it--

717
01:19:57.985 --> 01:20:02.152
Is it something that can be
controlled and I needed to know!


718
01:20:04.023 --> 01:20:06.190
What made you kill, Penny?

719
01:20:07.966 --> 01:20:11.315
What made someone like you
take another man's life?


720
01:20:21.383 --> 01:20:24.466
I killed Wojowski because I had to!

721
01:20:25.534 --> 01:20:26.367
But you?

722
01:20:27.574 --> 01:20:30.544
I'm gonna kill you because I want to.

723
01:20:32.542 --> 01:20:37.070
Killing me...
Only proves that I was right.


724
01:20:38.166 --> 01:20:39.424
Fine.

725
01:20:39.425 --> 01:20:40.675
You were right.

726
01:21:14.339 --> 01:21:16.527
They're gonna be coming
for me soon,...


727
01:21:16.528 --> 01:21:18.378
...because of what you did,...

728
01:21:18.379 --> 01:21:21.546
...you and that monster
that you created.


729
01:21:22.877 --> 01:21:25.710
Whatever.

730
01:21:26.990 --> 01:21:31.189
I guess we're gonna see
how this all ends, huh?


731
01:21:45.685 --> 01:21:46.685
Dr. Lentz!

732
01:21:48.597 --> 01:21:51.644
Dr. Lentz, we need to speak
with you, it's very important!


733
01:21:51.645 --> 01:21:53.916
It's about a call you made
to one of our detectives.


734
01:21:53.917 --> 01:21:55.584
Detective Hatherton.

735
01:21:58.725 --> 01:22:00.415
Dr. Lentz!

736
01:22:00.416 --> 01:22:01.249
Doctor--

737
01:22:16.790 --> 01:22:17.861
Is there anybody here?

738
01:22:17.862 --> 01:22:21.945
If there's anybody here,
show yourself right now!


739
01:22:51.939 --> 01:22:53.106
Damnit, Penny.

740
01:24:31.579 --> 01:24:32.412
Kim?

741
01:24:34.819 --> 01:24:35.785
Fuck.

742
01:24:35.786 --> 01:24:36.619
Jake.

743
01:24:38.637 --> 01:24:40.387
What have you done?

744
01:24:41.386 --> 01:24:42.219
Do it.

745
01:24:43.808 --> 01:24:45.158
Go on.

746
01:24:45.159 --> 01:24:46.308
Shoot me.

747
01:24:46.309 --> 01:24:47.729
Blow me straight to hell.

748
01:24:47.730 --> 01:24:51.147
You honestly think I give
a shit anymore?


749
01:24:52.290 --> 01:24:53.828
Why?

750
01:24:53.829 --> 01:24:54.662
Why her?

751
01:24:56.938 --> 01:24:58.605
I didn't kill her.

752
01:24:59.719 --> 01:25:02.188
I found her like that
whenever I got here.


753
01:25:02.189 --> 01:25:03.606
And the doctor?

754
01:25:04.559 --> 01:25:05.642
It was him.

755
01:25:06.629 --> 01:25:08.296
He was your copycat.

756
01:25:11.050 --> 01:25:13.216
It was him right from the beginning.

757
01:25:13.217 --> 01:25:17.049
Just the puppet-master
pulling all the strings.


758
01:25:17.050 --> 01:25:19.518
I checked his cell phone records.

759
01:25:19.519 --> 01:25:24.009
There were dozens of calls
made to a prepaid cell phone...


760
01:25:24.010 --> 01:25:27.177
...purchased by him
with his credit card.


761
01:25:28.146 --> 01:25:32.478
Most of them around the time
that you and your friends--


762
01:25:32.479 --> 01:25:36.646
Yeah, he was training Wojowski,
right from the beginning.


763
01:25:38.458 --> 01:25:43.215
Just pushing him over the edge,
just a little bit to unleash...


764
01:25:43.216 --> 01:25:46.133
...that killer that was inside of him.

765
01:25:47.770 --> 01:25:50.103
He did the same thing to me.

766
01:25:51.069 --> 01:25:54.649
I killed everybody I cared about.

767
01:25:54.650 --> 01:25:58.857
And anybody that got in the way.

768
01:25:58.858 --> 01:26:01.009
Like Sunny and that reporter.

769
01:26:01.010 --> 01:26:01.843
And Kim?

770
01:26:02.826 --> 01:26:04.897
He wanted to see just
how much I could take...


771
01:26:04.898 --> 01:26:08.065
...until I just went right
over the edge.


772
01:26:09.897 --> 01:26:12.230
Well I guess he found out.

773
01:26:15.279 --> 01:26:16.809
I guess he did.

774
01:26:16.810 --> 01:26:19.256
Then why not come to me for help?

775
01:26:19.257 --> 01:26:23.174
Penny, why did you bring
me back here, to this?


776
01:26:24.709 --> 01:26:27.709
This is where it all began for me.

777
01:26:29.987 --> 01:26:36.478
If Lentz was right...
Then whatever it was inside of me,...


778
01:26:36.479 --> 01:26:40.396
...that just woke up whenever
I killed Wojowski--


779
01:26:43.621 --> 01:26:47.038
It's not gonna end,
it's never gonna end.


780
01:26:49.610 --> 01:26:50.443
And--

781
01:26:54.101 --> 01:26:55.184
Those dreams.

782
01:26:56.511 --> 01:26:59.678
The dreams are just getting
more and more vivid,...


783
01:26:59.679 --> 01:27:01.630
...and more and more frequent.

784
01:27:01.631 --> 01:27:05.214
You didn't kill Sunny,
and that reporter.


785
01:27:06.367 --> 01:27:08.200
Penny, I believe that.

786
01:27:09.871 --> 01:27:11.788
Well, maybe I didn't.

787
01:27:15.781 --> 01:27:17.114
But I wanted to.

788
01:27:19.911 --> 01:27:22.994
I could actually see myself doing it.

789
01:27:26.490 --> 01:27:30.380
And if that's the way the rest
of my life is gonna be,...


790
01:27:30.381 --> 01:27:32.798
...then I don't even wanna live.

791
01:27:34.610 --> 01:27:35.443
No.

792
01:27:36.831 --> 01:27:38.414
What Lentz started,...

793
01:27:40.199 --> 01:27:43.837
...is gonna finish...
Right here, and now.


794
01:28:17.782 --> 01:28:22.280
You know, they made so many
of these in the 80s.


795
01:28:22.281 --> 01:28:26.448
I was a little too young to
remember but I checked.


796
01:28:28.081 --> 01:28:31.188
Turns out that you can
buy a bunch of 'em...


797
01:28:31.189 --> 01:28:33.856
...on the internet next to nothing.

798
01:28:36.011 --> 01:28:39.200
I don't know if it was Wojowski
or if it was Lentz...


799
01:28:39.201 --> 01:28:45.130
...that chose it, but,
whoever it was did a good job.


800
01:28:47.771 --> 01:28:51.938
Just all sorts of goodies that
you can just store in here.


801
01:28:58.131 --> 01:29:01.714
Whatever you're
planning on doing, don't.


802
01:29:04.434 --> 01:29:07.434
We can go to the prosecutor about--

803
01:29:08.521 --> 01:29:09.521
About Lentz.

804
01:29:12.077 --> 01:29:15.533
With all that you've been through,...

805
01:29:15.534 --> 01:29:18.867
...I'm sure that we can work
something out.


806
01:29:23.037 --> 01:29:25.306
I'm sorry, Jake.

807
01:29:25.307 --> 01:29:26.307
I really am.

808
01:29:34.197 --> 01:29:36.364
You know this game, right?

809
01:29:37.216 --> 01:29:38.883
You run and I chase.

810
01:29:40.685 --> 01:29:43.685
If Lentz was right, then I kill you.

811
01:29:45.973 --> 01:29:49.417
If not, you get away and
you bring back a posse...


812
01:29:49.418 --> 01:29:51.001
...to come and get me.

813
01:29:52.778 --> 01:29:57.338
Either way,...
This is gonna end today.


814
01:30:04.997 --> 01:30:05.830
Go.

815
01:33:55.878 --> 01:33:56.795
Stay there!

816
01:33:57.912 --> 01:33:58.829
Don't move.

817
01:34:00.878 --> 01:34:02.407
Penny.

818
01:34:02.408 --> 01:34:04.618
This isn't you.

819
01:34:06.939 --> 01:34:09.905
Stop acting like you know me, Jake!

820
01:34:09.906 --> 01:34:13.607
You don't know me, you
don't know the real me!


821
01:34:13.608 --> 01:34:17.775
There's something behind these
eyes that are just screaming!


822
01:34:18.667 --> 01:34:21.334
And it wants to kill everything!

823
01:34:24.075 --> 01:34:25.538
Penny.

824
01:34:25.539 --> 01:34:28.687
It's not--

825
01:34:28.688 --> 01:34:32.855
It's not you, it's, it's
everything that's happened to you.


826
01:34:34.436 --> 01:34:37.906
It's Lentz and all his
bullshit theories.


827
01:34:37.907 --> 01:34:41.385
The real you can choose
who you wanna be.


828
01:34:41.386 --> 01:34:43.719
I know that you know I've--

829
01:34:45.544 --> 01:34:48.908
I've come to care about
you a great deal.


830
01:34:48.909 --> 01:34:52.141
Shut up!

831
01:34:52.142 --> 01:34:54.157
There isn't enough going on
that I gotta worry about...


832
01:34:54.158 --> 01:34:57.570
...some detective having
a schoolboy crush on me.


833
01:34:57.571 --> 01:34:58.404
Come on!

834
01:34:59.710 --> 01:35:02.210
I'm just trying to help you
remember the girl you were...


835
01:35:02.211 --> 01:35:04.878
...before all this happened to you.

836
01:35:18.257 --> 01:35:19.090
No.

837
01:35:20.046 --> 01:35:21.576
No.

838
01:35:21.577 --> 01:35:24.445
No, there's no going back.

839
01:35:24.446 --> 01:35:25.363
Not for me.

840
01:35:30.347 --> 01:35:31.180
Well--

841
01:35:32.057 --> 01:35:35.993
Then I guess--

842
01:35:35.994 --> 01:35:38.827
You're gonna have to kill me then.

843
01:35:43.795 --> 01:35:44.878
I guess so.

844
01:35:46.776 --> 01:35:49.776
And, if you kill me, that means--

845
01:35:50.707 --> 01:35:53.540
Oh, this thing, that's inside you,...

846
01:35:54.845 --> 01:35:57.815
...that means that is
who you really are.


847
01:35:57.816 --> 01:35:59.393
No.

848
01:35:59.394 --> 01:36:02.394
No more mind games, no more nothing.

849
01:36:03.514 --> 01:36:04.681
This all ends.

850
01:36:13.653 --> 01:36:15.403
I'm, I'm sorry, Jake.

851
01:36:16.816 --> 01:36:18.135
Yeah.

852
01:36:20.484 --> 01:36:21.484
Me too.

853
01:36:50.051 --> 01:36:50.884
Damnit.

854
01:36:53.012 --> 01:36:54.498
Fine.

855
01:36:54.499 --> 01:36:55.332
Go ahead.

856
01:36:56.550 --> 01:36:58.133
Just make it quick.

857
01:37:02.510 --> 01:37:03.926
Come on, Penny.

858
01:37:03.927 --> 01:37:06.418
What the fuck are you doing?

859
01:37:06.419 --> 01:37:07.938
I told you.

860
01:37:07.939 --> 01:37:10.189
I just, wanted to help you.

861
01:37:11.888 --> 01:37:14.721
Well you can't, can you?

862
01:38:16.050 --> 01:38:16.937
Mosser!

863
01:38:16.938 --> 01:38:18.361
There is no way on earth
I'm gonna let you...


864
01:38:18.362 --> 01:38:19.687
...interrogate that woman.

865
01:38:19.688 --> 01:38:22.441
Yeah, you and the
DA try and stop me.

866
01:38:22.442 --> 01:38:26.128
Chief will have your badge for this.
