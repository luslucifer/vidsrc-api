<i>Awakening.</i>

2
00:02:25.498 --> 00:02:28.123
<i>Alternate your hips
from side to side</i>


3
00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.790

and hands</i>


4
00:02:31.082 --> 00:02:33.832
<i>as if you are waking up
your limbs.</i>


5
00:02:36.457 --> 00:02:38.582
Callum, bring her down.

6
00:02:39.915 --> 00:02:42.373
- That's it, let Karen sleep.
- Let's go see Nana.


7
00:02:44.623 --> 00:02:45.915
Come on.

8
00:02:45.998 --> 00:02:47.498
Oh, you little beauty.

9
00:02:47.582 --> 00:02:48.665
<i>Temple.</i>

10
00:02:49.582 --> 00:02:53.582
Oh, that's enough noise.

11
00:02:53.665 --> 00:02:56.207
Shush. Come on, we'll go
and have a little dance.


12
00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:57.457
- Here we are.
<i>- Seduce.</i>


13
00:02:59.707 --> 00:03:00.790
Here you go, look.

14
00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:03.665
<i>And over to the other side.</i>

15
00:03:03.873 --> 00:03:05.790
Eh, what about Mandy?

16
00:03:05.998 --> 00:03:07.957
- Mandy?
- Mmm-hmm.


17
00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.123
Are you fucking joking, Mum?

18
00:03:13.998 --> 00:03:15.248
<i>Twice more.</i>

19
00:03:17.082 --> 00:03:18.498
<i>And one last time.</i>

20
00:03:19.623 --> 00:03:21.707
<i>Give and take.</i>

21
00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.123
<i>Other foot forward.</i>

22
00:03:27.165 --> 00:03:29.873
Oh, shurrup.
Right, Venice, go, school.


23
00:03:29.957 --> 00:03:31.498
- I'm gonna turn it off.
- No.


24
00:03:31.582 --> 00:03:32.957
- Go on.
- I don't wanna go.


25
00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.332
I know you don't.
Get to it.


26
00:03:36.332 --> 00:03:38.082
Right, are you stopping here
tonight or at Karen's?


27
00:03:38.415 --> 00:03:39.748
- Um...
- Bye, I'm off.


28
00:03:40.373 --> 00:03:41.665
Bye.

29
00:03:41.748 --> 00:03:43.540
- Probably Karen's.
- Right.


30
00:03:43.832 --> 00:03:44.915
Venice!

31
00:03:45.373 --> 00:03:47.040
Get out after her,
take her that bag.


32
00:03:47.123 --> 00:03:48.790
Well, I can't go
dressed like this, can I?


33
00:03:48.873 --> 00:03:51.540
Oh, fucking hell.
Take the baby, I'll go.


34
00:03:52.873 --> 00:03:54.665
- Venice!
- Hello, baby.


35
00:03:54.748 --> 00:03:56.582
- It's okay.
- You've left your bag!


36
00:03:56.665 --> 00:03:58.873
Yeah, yeah!

37
00:04:35.373 --> 00:04:37.582
- Morning.
- Morning.


38
00:04:39.957 --> 00:04:41.623
- You sleep all right?
- Yeah.


39
00:04:51.332 --> 00:04:52.665
You all right with this?

40
00:04:53.665 --> 00:04:54.832
Really?

41
00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:56.832
Yeah.

42
00:04:57.915 --> 00:04:59.415
It's like flatmates, in't it?

43
00:05:00.665 --> 00:05:01.873
Ali.

44
00:05:01.957 --> 00:05:03.165
Come on, now. I'm just...

45
00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.040
I'm just mucking about
with you.


46
00:05:12.373 --> 00:05:13.665
Okay.

47
00:05:14.707 --> 00:05:15.957
You're coming for dinner,
though?


48
00:05:19.207 --> 00:05:20.457
No.

49
00:05:20.998 --> 00:05:23.207
- It's got to be different...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. All right.


50
00:05:23.623 --> 00:05:24.665
Okay.

51
00:05:29.207 --> 00:05:30.290
I'm all right.

52
00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.415
Go on, you'll be late.

53
00:06:09.082 --> 00:06:10.332
All right, Mum?

54
00:06:12.707 --> 00:06:15.623
Here you are. Gi's a cuddle.

55
00:06:15.707 --> 00:06:17.873
You got confused, didn't you?
How are you? You all right?


56
00:06:18.457 --> 00:06:19.540
- You all right?

All right, Barna, open up.
It's your favourite landlord.


74
00:07:50.248 --> 00:07:51.290
- All right, mate.
- You all right?


75
00:07:51.373 --> 00:07:52.415
- You okay?
- Good.


76
00:07:52.498 --> 00:07:53.540
- How are you?
- Fine.


77
00:07:53.623 --> 00:07:54.582
- Good, good.
- Okay.


78
00:07:54.748 --> 00:07:56.623
I finish plastering today
in the kitchen


79
00:07:56.707 --> 00:07:58.623
and start hall today, for you.

80
00:07:58.707 --> 00:08:00.248
- Thank you. Brilliant.
- Okay? No problem.


81
00:08:00.332 --> 00:08:02.123
Yeah, be good. And, er,
see you at 43.


82
00:08:02.207 --> 00:08:03.498
- All right, okay.
- Great, man,


83
00:08:03.582 --> 00:08:05.040
- thank you so much.
- Thank you. See ya.


84
00:08:07.373 --> 00:08:08.540
Barna,
can you get us


85
00:08:08.623 --> 00:08:09.748
that screwdriver
we used last time?


86
00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:13.415
I'll open this up.

87
00:08:15.707 --> 00:08:16.832
Cheers.

88
00:08:17.873 --> 00:08:18.957
Right.

89
00:08:21.123 --> 00:08:22.498
Kids off to school?

90
00:08:25.415 --> 00:08:27.457
Mmm-mmm.
No, no, no, no.


91
00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:29.082
That should fix it.
Should fix it.


92
00:08:29.165 --> 00:08:30.373
Bye.

93
00:08:30.457 --> 00:08:31.915
All right,
see you later, kids.


94
00:08:31.998 --> 00:08:33.415
See you later. 
See you later.

95
00:08:33.957 --> 00:08:35.332
Bye.

96
00:08:36.832 --> 00:08:38.082
What's up with this one?

97
00:08:38.707 --> 00:08:40.707
- Crying no going for school.
- Not going to school?


98
00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:43.332
I know, I saw that,
"No, no, no, no, no".


99
00:08:45.082 --> 00:08:46.415
Oh. You don't wanna go
to school?


100
00:08:46.498 --> 00:08:47.790
Yeah, I didn't like school
either.


101
00:08:49.165 --> 00:08:50.415
D'you wanna get
on my shoulders?


102
00:08:50.832 --> 00:08:52.957
Then you'll be the tallest
person in school there.


103
00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:54.248
We can do a shoulder ride.

104
00:08:54.332 --> 00:08:56.457
No? Are you joking?

105
00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:58.498
I'm talking
about a shoulder ride!


106
00:08:58.582 --> 00:09:00.748
- Yes!
- The best... Yes!


107
00:09:00.832 --> 00:09:01.873
- Yes.
- Let's do it.


108
00:09:01.957 --> 00:09:03.707
Come on, you, let's go.

109
00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:05.540
Up on the chair.
Aw, that's nice.


110
00:09:06.248 --> 00:09:07.290
Okay.

111
00:09:07.373 --> 00:09:10.040
And another leg, here.
Okay, all right... Nina, up...


112
00:09:10.123 --> 00:09:12.373
- Higher, higher.
- Nina, open the door!


113
00:09:12.457 --> 00:09:14.123
Mind your head.
Wahey!


114
00:09:20.915 --> 00:09:23.040
Morning.
I know.


115
00:09:23.623 --> 00:09:26.123
- Hi, Miss!
- Morning, Miss!


116
00:09:26.957 --> 00:09:28.373
Morning. Oh!

117
00:09:32.582 --> 00:09:34.957
Hiya, love.
Look, new moon today.


118
00:09:35.748 --> 00:09:37.290
Yay!

119
00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:40.082
Hey, Sofia, listen.
Come here.


120
00:09:40.707 --> 00:09:42.498
Come here. Hey, Sofia.

121
00:09:43.082 --> 00:09:44.998
Sofia...

122
00:09:46.415 --> 00:09:47.873
Right, see you later, love.

123
00:09:49.915 --> 00:09:51.998
Right, come on, then,
let's get in.


124
00:09:52.082 --> 00:09:55.748
Come on, girls, in you go.
Go on. After you, go on, love.


125
00:09:57.207 --> 00:09:58.998
- And that one?
- It's the sun.


126
00:09:59.373 --> 00:10:01.332
And what's that one
above it? Mmm...


127
00:10:01.415 --> 00:10:02.457
Ooh...

128
00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:05.957
- Moll.
- Mool? Is that a "luh"?


129
00:10:06.665 --> 00:10:07.707
No.

130
00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:09.832
- Moo...
- Mull.


131
00:10:10.207 --> 00:10:11.707
What's that sound?

132
00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:15.498
- You said moo... Mmm, mull.
- Mmm, moon. Moon.


133
00:10:16.332 --> 00:10:17.748
Moon.

134
00:10:26.498 --> 00:10:28.123
Oh,
there's so many of you!


135
00:10:28.957 --> 00:10:31.165
Oh, not too loud.

136
00:10:37.957 --> 00:10:39.123
Boys, line up there.

137
00:10:44.582 --> 00:10:46.082
Turn round, that way.

138
00:11:02.415 --> 00:11:03.623
Not again.

139
00:11:03.998 --> 00:11:05.748
Come on, everyone's lined up
and gone in.


140
00:11:07.915 --> 00:11:10.332
Right, listen, darling.
Can you go on your knees?


141
00:11:10.415 --> 00:11:12.040
And turn round
and come down backwards.


142
00:11:13.582 --> 00:11:15.790
Come on, come here, look.
Give us your hand.


143
00:11:15.873 --> 00:11:18.040
Come on, darling.

144
00:11:18.123 --> 00:11:19.998
It's all right. Good girl.

145
00:11:21.998 --> 00:11:24.207
Come down backwards
like I showed you.


146
00:11:24.498 --> 00:11:26.207
Turn around.

147
00:11:26.748 --> 00:11:27.623
Stop.

148
00:11:27.707 --> 00:11:29.957
It's all right, darling.

149
00:11:31.457 --> 00:11:34.457
It's all right.
Good girl, down you go.


150
00:11:35.123 --> 00:11:36.998
That's it, like I showed ya.

151
00:11:37.748 --> 00:11:38.998
Good girl,
and put one foot here.


152
00:11:39.082 --> 00:11:40.165
Thank you, Miss.

153
00:11:40.248 --> 00:11:41.332
And another one.

154
00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:43.832
There she goes, buh-boom!

155
00:11:47.373 --> 00:11:50.623
I know. Listen, if you're
brave enough to climb up,


156
00:11:50.748 --> 00:11:52.832
you've gotta be brave enough
to climb back down.


157
00:11:53.873 --> 00:11:56.498
We're gonna get soaked!

158
00:11:57.457 --> 00:11:59.957
- We're gonna get wet.
- I know!

You stay there, right.
Stay there.


490
00:28:40.457 --> 00:28:41.832

495
00:28:46.207 --> 00:28:47.623
All right, I'll see

496
00:28:47.707 --> 00:28:49.248
Silly little bastard.

Oh, fucking hell, you idiot!

498
00:28:52.998 --> 00:28:54.915
What d'you think me dad
would have to say about it?


499
00:28:58.915 --> 00:29:00.415
You don't even know him.

500
00:29:03.832 --> 00:29:04.873
Listen.

501
00:29:05.998 --> 00:29:06.998
He's a friend.

502
00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:09.373
Right, there's nowt going on.

503
00:29:10.457 --> 00:29:13.082
And even if there were,
which there in't...


504
00:29:15.665 --> 00:29:16.873
we were separated.

505
00:29:22.582 --> 00:29:24.707
I miss him, too, I really do.

506
00:29:27.498 --> 00:29:28.623
Take her.

507
00:29:34.373 --> 00:29:36.582
He'd have been a very proud
granddad, wouldn't he?


508
00:29:40.623 --> 00:29:41.998
And you know what?
He'd have made sure


509
00:29:42.082 --> 00:29:44.373
you'd chosen her a name
by now and all, you dickhead.


510
00:29:46.790 --> 00:29:48.582
It would've been easy
if she'd have been a he.


511
00:29:51.457 --> 00:29:54.457
- What about Paula?
- Oh, yeah.


512
00:29:55.748 --> 00:29:57.665
I don't know why I've never
thought of that one before.


513
00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:00.790
I'll have to ask Karen.

514
00:30:03.082 --> 00:30:04.582
She says no to all my ideas.

515
00:30:07.332 --> 00:30:08.415
Oh, my darling.

516
00:30:08.832 --> 00:30:10.207
I can see you
doing it, Hakim.


517
00:30:10.290 --> 00:30:11.707
- Please.
- Stop it.


518
00:30:12.373 --> 00:30:14.123
Put it away.
Put it away, now.


519
00:30:14.623 --> 00:30:16.415
Aisha, have you got
your boots ready?


520
00:30:16.498 --> 00:30:18.040
- Yeah.
- Are you excited?


521
00:30:18.123 --> 00:30:19.248
I'm excited.

522
00:30:19.332 --> 00:30:20.832
- You all right, mate?
- Yeah, I'm all right.


523
00:30:20.915 --> 00:30:22.165
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

524
00:30:22.498 --> 00:30:24.540
How you doing, mate?
You all right? Put that away.


525
00:30:25.915 --> 00:30:28.040
- What position you playing?
- I'm in goal.


526
00:30:28.415 --> 00:30:30.748
Oh, same as your granddad,
<i>hai na?</i>


527
00:30:31.248 --> 00:30:33.165
How many times?
Put it away now!


528
00:30:33.248 --> 00:30:34.498
Did he really play
in goal?


529
00:30:35.790 --> 00:30:37.498
Put your phone away. How many
times has your mum told you?


530
00:30:37.582 --> 00:30:38.790
- Give me a sec.
- No, now.


531
00:30:40.582 --> 00:30:41.748
Coming to t'match?

532
00:30:42.457 --> 00:30:43.582
I've got to study.

533
00:30:43.665 --> 00:30:44.623
Yeah, at least she's stuck

534
00:30:44.707 --> 00:30:46.123
with her education,
unlike you.


535
00:30:46.415 --> 00:30:47.582
- Yeah.
- Eh, eh, eh.


536
00:30:48.082 --> 00:30:49.540
He were always clever.

537
00:30:50.123 --> 00:30:51.498
Just couldn't sit still,
could ya?


538
00:30:52.082 --> 00:30:53.707
Yeah, like that.
Just couldn't even...


539
00:30:53.790 --> 00:30:55.290
Nothing's changed,
has it?


540
00:30:56.082 --> 00:30:57.540
That's funny,
I'm wiggling.


541
00:30:57.623 --> 00:30:58.748
It is funny.

542
00:30:59.498 --> 00:31:01.248
It's a funny thing.
Funny, yeah?


543
00:31:02.290 --> 00:31:03.457
Can I get a plate, please?

544
00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:04.832
Mum,
have you got a plate?


545
00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:07.332
- Okay.
- I'm just gonna write...


546
00:31:07.415 --> 00:31:08.832
- two more.
- Right, come on.


547
00:31:08.915 --> 00:31:11.373
Hang on, let's put
that one in and, erm...


548
00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:13.832
- Right, gonna do one more.
- Don't look!


549
00:31:13.915 --> 00:31:14.957
I can't believe
I'm picking


550
00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:16.165
my daughter's name
out of a jar.


551
00:31:16.248 --> 00:31:17.498
Well, you know,
we waited for you


552
00:31:17.582 --> 00:31:18.998
to do it the normal way.

553
00:31:19.082 --> 00:31:20.582
- Yeah.
- Now, give it a go, yeah?


554
00:31:20.665 --> 00:31:23.040
- Right, okay.
- Give it a shake.


555
00:31:23.123 --> 00:31:26.248
Ready? Right.
Three, two, one.


556
00:31:26.873 --> 00:31:29.207
- Go on. Come on.
- No, I can't get it.


557
00:31:29.290 --> 00:31:30.373
Go on!

558
00:31:30.457 --> 00:31:31.623
What have you got,
Callum?


559
00:31:31.707 --> 00:31:32.915
Fat hands.

560
00:31:32.998 --> 00:31:34.915
Fuck off.

561
00:31:34.998 --> 00:31:36.123
Go on, then.

562
00:31:36.790 --> 00:31:37.873
"Ee-meer."

563
00:31:37.957 --> 00:31:39.332
He-man?

564
00:31:39.415 --> 00:31:40.582
That don't even
make sense.


565
00:31:40.665 --> 00:31:42.207
- You what?
- "Eimhear."


566
00:31:42.957 --> 00:31:44.748
Eimhear, that's a pretty name.

567
00:31:45.123 --> 00:31:46.873
- Eimhear?
- Where'd you get that from?


568
00:31:47.165 --> 00:31:48.332
Ireland.

569
00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:50.290
All right.
Okay, one more.


570
00:31:55.207 --> 00:31:56.332
Ay-o-fee?

571
00:31:56.790 --> 00:31:58.873
It's Aoife.

572
00:31:58.957 --> 00:32:00.498
- Are these all Irish names?
- Yeah, they are.


573
00:32:00.582 --> 00:32:02.123
Why did I get "Michelle",
then?


574
00:32:02.207 --> 00:32:03.498
- Huh? What?
- You're not Irish.


575
00:32:03.582 --> 00:32:04.707
Well, excuse me.

576
00:32:04.790 --> 00:32:06.623
What about a name
we can actually spell, Mum,


577
00:32:06.707 --> 00:32:09.582
that's not "Eimhear"
or "IOU" or summat?


578
00:32:09.665 --> 00:32:10.998
Hey, what about Grace?

579
00:32:12.207 --> 00:32:14.207
Ladies and gentlemen,
please put your hands together


580
00:32:14.290 --> 00:32:16.915
for tonight's next singers,
Callum and Ava.


581
00:32:16.998 --> 00:32:19.123
Come on, Mum.

582
00:32:19.707 --> 00:32:21.165
You gotta do this
properly, though.

Morning! Thank you!

612

You're welcome.
And could you give


613
00:33:52.623 --> 00:33:54.040
- that to Ali, please?
- Huh?


614
00:33:56.540 --> 00:33:58.373

I've sent a note

619
00:34:17.415 --> 00:34:19.540
and I've said sorry
on your behalf.


620
00:34:21.998 --> 00:34:23.373
I'll probably
not hear from him again.


621
00:34:23.748 --> 00:34:24.665
Good.

622
00:34:25.998 --> 00:34:27.623
Mind out!

623
00:34:27.832 --> 00:34:28.957
I'm gonna make tea.

624
00:34:43.873 --> 00:34:45.082
- All right, Ali?
- Yeah, all right.


625
00:34:45.165 --> 00:34:46.873
- Yeah.
- Yeah? Good.


626
00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:26.623
That's it.

627
00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:28.082
Well done.

628
00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:30.040
That's better.

629
00:35:31.998 --> 00:35:33.040
That's better.

630
00:35:33.582 --> 00:35:35.082
That was a big burp, innit?

631
00:35:36.665 --> 00:35:38.707
Come on. Go to sleep.

632
00:35:40.915 --> 00:35:42.248
Go to sleep.

633
00:36:22.665 --> 00:36:23.998
- Hey.
- How's it going?


634
00:36:24.998 --> 00:36:26.623
Yeah.

635
00:36:28.498 --> 00:36:29.748
Been up all night?

636
00:36:30.457 --> 00:36:31.582
Yeah.

637
00:36:33.915 --> 00:36:35.248
Get some rest,
I'll read it for ya.


638
00:36:36.665 --> 00:36:37.873
Gotta get it finished.

639
00:36:40.498 --> 00:36:42.748
A friend from uni's got
a spare room coming up.


640
00:36:44.082 --> 00:36:45.373
I think I'm gonna take it.

641
00:36:49.457 --> 00:36:52.373
All right, but...
don't tell my family yet.


642
00:37:44.790 --> 00:37:45.957
Are you okay?

643
00:37:47.998 --> 00:37:49.165
Oh, what's the matter?

644
00:37:50.165 --> 00:37:52.082
Oh, Sofia.

645
00:38:03.123 --> 00:38:05.165
- I don't like school.
- I know.


646
00:38:06.665 --> 00:38:09.207
I don't wanna leave
my sister and my brother.


647
00:38:09.540 --> 00:38:11.665
- Hey, look at me.
- I want to stay with them.


648
00:38:11.748 --> 00:38:14.498
Listen, Mummy and Daddy
are at home


649
00:38:14.582 --> 00:38:16.623
and you'll see them
in a little bit, won't ya?


650
00:38:17.082 --> 00:38:20.415
And they'll give you
a big cuddle, for Sofia.


651
00:38:21.123 --> 00:38:22.915
Give me a little smile.

652
00:38:31.498 --> 00:38:33.373
- What's this?
- House.


653
00:38:33.832 --> 00:38:35.998
Oh, I love it.
Is it your home?


654
00:38:36.082 --> 00:38:37.665
No, it's your house.

655
00:38:37.748 --> 00:38:40.498
Oh, that's really nice.

656
00:38:42.290 --> 00:38:45.040
That's nice. Can I have
a tree in my garden?


657
00:38:45.707 --> 00:38:47.832
- Yeah, of course.
- Thank you.


658
00:38:52.457 --> 00:38:54.290
Bye-bye.
- See you later. Bye.


659
00:38:55.998 --> 00:38:57.915
Hiya.

660
00:38:57.998 --> 00:39:00.123
- This is for you.
- Oh, thank you.


661
00:39:04.582 --> 00:39:06.082
Huh?

662
00:39:15.748 --> 00:39:17.373
♪ He told me you got it

663
00:39:17.457 --> 00:39:19.332
♪ You got it
Mmm, mmm, mmm


664
00:39:19.457 --> 00:39:21.957
♪ And he said
You got it, I got it


665
00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:27.123
All right.

666
00:39:27.623 --> 00:39:30.290
One, two, three, four...

667
00:39:31.332 --> 00:39:34.498
Where is it? Oh, you.

668
00:39:34.623 --> 00:39:37.207
- Don't.
- Oh! Ow! You got me!


669
00:39:37.457 --> 00:39:39.248
I were fucking terrified.

670
00:39:39.707 --> 00:39:40.707
Eh?

671
00:39:42.498 --> 00:39:43.582
I'm sorry about Callum.

672
00:39:43.665 --> 00:39:45.665
Well,
you should be. He's a nutter.


673
00:39:46.332 --> 00:39:48.165
Well, he can just be
a bit funny about me


674
00:39:48.248 --> 00:39:49.748
- and, you know...
- You and?


675
00:39:50.332 --> 00:39:51.748
You know, he might've
got the wrong idea.


676
00:39:51.832 --> 00:39:52.998
- Wrong idea?
- About you.


677
00:39:53.332 --> 00:39:54.707
What about?
What, what do you mean?


678
00:39:54.998 --> 00:39:56.207
- And me.
- You and...


679
00:39:56.290 --> 00:39:58.082
- Just you and me, he might...
- You and me?


680
00:39:58.165 --> 00:39:59.915
What, is that a...
that's a thing, is it?


681
00:39:59.998 --> 00:40:01.457
No, it's not. No.

682
00:40:01.540 --> 00:40:03.707
- It's not a thing.
- Yeah, I'm joking.


683
00:40:03.790 --> 00:40:05.790
No, he's, er... 
He can just be

684
00:40:05.873 --> 00:40:07.248
a bit overprotective,
that's what it is.


685
00:40:07.332 --> 00:40:10.332
Overprotective? Bloody hell.
That's what you call it?


686
00:40:11.957 --> 00:40:13.790
He lost his dad
just over a year ago,


687
00:40:13.873 --> 00:40:15.832
so that might have something
to do with it.


688
00:40:16.248 --> 00:40:17.248
Right.

689
00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:19.498
But don't think badly of him.

690
00:40:19.582 --> 00:40:21.540
No, no, I don't.
Must be hard for him.


691
00:40:22.373 --> 00:40:23.332
And you?

692
00:40:25.457 --> 00:40:28.915
Yeah.

693
00:40:30.623 --> 00:40:32.957
Put a finger
in your mouth, into...


694
00:40:33.415 --> 00:40:34.498
Come on,
let's have some, then.


695
00:40:39.165 --> 00:40:41.415
Oh! Why'd you do that?

696
00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:43.748
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.


697
00:40:43.832 --> 00:40:44.832
Just put it
in your mouth!


698
00:40:44.915 --> 00:40:46.623
- All right?
- Yeah.


699
00:40:47.540 --> 00:40:49.165
This is Aisha, my niece.

700
00:40:49.748 --> 00:40:52.707
This is, er, Ava,
Sofia's teacher.


701
00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:54.998
Well, classroom assistant.
Hiya, love.


702
00:40:55.207 --> 00:40:56.415
- Hi.
- You all right?


703
00:40:56.665 --> 00:40:58.415
- Yeah. You?
- Yeah, fine.


704
00:41:02.165 --> 00:41:04.707
- That's nice, isn't it?
- Mmm-hmm.


705
00:41:05.082 --> 00:41:08.040
You're making me
giggle. Giggle.


706
00:41:12.707 --> 00:41:14.457
- Bye, love.
- See you later.


707
00:41:14.582 --> 00:41:16.748
- Bye, miss, see you later.
- See ya.


708
00:41:16.832 --> 00:41:17.957
Bye!

709
00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:20.040
Shouting
her head off already.


710
00:41:20.248 --> 00:41:24.082
I love this city.

711
00:41:25.415 --> 00:41:26.873
What,
even in t'pissing rain?


712
00:41:26.957 --> 00:41:28.832
Yeah. Yeah.

713
00:41:32.290 --> 00:41:33.332
Right.

714
00:41:33.748 --> 00:41:35.165
- Where we going now?
- Come on.


715
00:41:40.165 --> 00:41:42.540
Out of the way, you kids.

716
00:41:45.290 --> 00:41:47.832
Oh, look at 'em, eh. Wow.

717
00:41:49.540 --> 00:41:50.790
Hello, mate.
How you doing?


718
00:41:50.873 --> 00:41:52.248
- You all right?
- Good to see ya.


719
00:41:54.873 --> 00:41:56.582
Don't worry about him,
he thinks he's big time.


720
00:41:56.665 --> 00:41:57.873
Come on. Right.

721
00:41:57.957 --> 00:41:58.998
Are we going
down here?


722
00:41:59.082 --> 00:42:00.332
Mind your step,
mind these steps.


723
00:42:00.415 --> 00:42:02.415
It's steep.
It's steep and wet, all right?


724
00:42:02.498 --> 00:42:03.540
- Yeah.
- Careful.


725
00:42:04.123 --> 00:42:05.498
Right, here we are.

726
00:42:05.957 --> 00:42:07.623
- Look, kick them out the way.
- Oh, sorry.


727
00:42:07.707 --> 00:42:08.873
Yeah, no, it's fine.

728
00:42:09.207 --> 00:42:11.123
Right, this is, er,
the man cave,


729
00:42:11.207 --> 00:42:12.832
and the rest of the house
is upstairs.


730
00:42:12.998 --> 00:42:14.082
Look at this.

731
00:42:14.915 --> 00:42:18.248
Er, see that? Look.
Tenant gave me that.


732
00:42:18.373 --> 00:42:20.165
That's really nice,
a little guitar.


733
00:42:20.290 --> 00:42:21.748
Yeah.
It's a ukulele.


734
00:42:21.832 --> 00:42:23.373
- Tenant gave it me.
- Can't you afford a big one?


735
00:42:23.457 --> 00:42:24.790
- No, I can if I wanted.
- All right.


736
00:42:24.873 --> 00:42:26.040
- It's nice, though, in't it?
- Yeah.


737
00:42:26.123 --> 00:42:27.165
Sit down. Come on.
Oh, no,


738
00:42:27.248 --> 00:42:28.707
let me move that
out the way. Move them.


739
00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:29.790
- All right.
- Sit down.


740
00:42:30.707 --> 00:42:33.207
Erm... Right, so here it is.

741
00:42:33.498 --> 00:42:34.873
The vinyl, the decks,

742
00:42:34.957 --> 00:42:36.707
- and I got my books up here.
- Oh, yeah?


743
00:42:36.957 --> 00:42:40.165
It's just libraries
and bookshops or...


744
00:42:40.498 --> 00:42:41.832
whatever it is.
They just sort of...


745
00:42:41.915 --> 00:42:43.623
They just sort of
calm me down. So...


746
00:42:43.748 --> 00:42:46.082
I would have, er, put them
in alphabetical order,


747
00:42:46.165 --> 00:42:47.540
but I've
colour-coordinated 'em.


748
00:42:47.665 --> 00:42:49.040
Have you read
all of them, then?


749
00:42:49.123 --> 00:42:50.415
Oh, yeah. Some of them.

750
00:42:50.498 --> 00:42:51.540
You sure?

751
00:42:52.207 --> 00:42:53.832
Yeah, well, I dip in
and out of 'em.


752
00:42:53.915 --> 00:42:55.040
Shelf decoration.

753
00:42:55.290 --> 00:42:56.832
Yeah.

754
00:42:57.457 --> 00:42:59.457
No, I... Some of 'em,
I don't know. Look.


755
00:42:59.623 --> 00:43:00.748
Sit back, sit back.

756
00:43:00.832 --> 00:43:01.915
- Oh.
- All right?


757
00:43:01.998 --> 00:43:03.123
- Sorry.
- Oh, chuck it on the floor.


758

- All right?
- Hi.


958
00:55:25.290 --> 00:55:26.415
Didn't think you'd come.

959
00:55:28.207 --> 00:55:29.207
Why here?

960
00:55:30.040 --> 00:55:32.457
I come every month
for the new moon.


961
00:55:32.540 --> 00:55:34.665
My dad used to bring me,
but, look,


962
00:55:34.790 --> 00:55:36.332
waxing half-moon tonight.

963
00:55:39.165 --> 00:55:40.123
Paul's buried here.

964
00:55:40.540 --> 00:55:42.165
Oh, shit.
I'm sorry, I didn't...


965
00:55:42.248 --> 00:55:43.290
No, it's all right.

966
00:55:49.248 --> 00:55:50.873
He used to beat me to fuck.

967
00:55:55.207 --> 00:55:56.832
Put his boots on to do it.

968
00:56:01.790 --> 00:56:03.123
When he started
on our Michelle,


969
00:56:03.207 --> 00:56:04.248
that's when I left him.

970
00:56:05.207 --> 00:56:06.373
Callum don't know, though.

971
00:56:08.582 --> 00:56:09.582
What?

972
00:56:10.790 --> 00:56:12.123
That he hurt our Michelle.

973
00:56:14.665 --> 00:56:17.665
Her dad's Indian,
Paul were a skinhead.


974
00:56:17.915 --> 00:56:19.290
A member
of the National Front.


975
00:56:21.207 --> 00:56:22.373
Do you know what I did?

976
00:56:23.748 --> 00:56:24.790
No.

977
00:56:26.498 --> 00:56:28.207
One time, he came back drunk

978
00:56:29.082 --> 00:56:30.623
and I knew
he were gonna start.


979
00:56:33.582 --> 00:56:35.707
So I went
and got his boots for him.


980
00:56:36.415 --> 00:56:39.540
Cos I knew
if I didn't, then he would.


981
00:56:41.498 --> 00:56:43.832
And I were scared he were
gonna hurt Michelle again.


982
00:56:47.123 --> 00:56:49.165
And after he beat me
black and blue...


983
00:56:51.290 --> 00:56:53.332
I looked at them boots
and I thought,


984
00:56:54.248 --> 00:56:56.707
"How could someone
as strong as me do that?"


985
00:56:59.540 --> 00:57:01.582
It was one of those moments
that changes you.


986
00:57:03.540 --> 00:57:04.790
So I kicked him out.

987
00:57:06.582 --> 00:57:08.540
I went back to college
and I did a degree.


988
00:57:08.623 --> 00:57:10.040
And here I am.

989
00:57:32.623 --> 00:57:33.873
Right, then, I'll see ya.

990
00:57:33.957 --> 00:57:36.248
Oh, God.
I don't wanna go home.


991
00:57:39.457 --> 00:57:40.748
I like being here with ya.

992
00:57:43.290 --> 00:57:44.165
Plus, I...

993
00:57:44.248 --> 00:57:46.332
It's not safe for me to drive
cos I've had a...


994
00:57:47.165 --> 00:57:48.082
- You know.
- A what?


995
00:57:48.165 --> 00:57:49.915
Well, that's
the universal sign for drink.


996
00:57:49.998 --> 00:57:51.290
- I had a drink.
- All right. But, yeah,


997
00:57:51.373 --> 00:57:53.082
you have only had one of them.

998
00:57:53.165 --> 00:57:54.165
Yeah, but...

999
00:57:55.998 --> 00:57:58.707
- Take a good look at me.
- Why?


1000
00:57:59.373 --> 00:58:00.540
My constitution.

1001
00:58:00.623 --> 00:58:01.998
- I'm not used to it, so...
- Oh.


1002
00:58:04.998 --> 00:58:06.415
Is that why
you've had a drink?


1003
00:58:08.207 --> 00:58:11.123
Plus, you can't get a taxi
here for love nor money, so.


1004
00:58:11.248 --> 00:58:12.457
I could get you a local taxi.

1005
00:58:12.540 --> 00:58:13.790
- Can you?
- Very easily.


1006
00:58:17.790 --> 00:58:18.790
I wanna stay.

1007
00:58:26.290 --> 00:58:27.623
You can have Callum's room.

1008
00:58:34.915 --> 00:58:35.957
All right.

1009
00:58:40.790 --> 00:58:41.832
- What?
- Yeah.


1010
00:58:42.957 --> 00:58:45.748
Er, I'm gonna get you
something to wear.


1011
00:58:46.415 --> 00:58:47.498
That's nice.

1012
00:58:48.998 --> 00:58:51.082
Oh, yeah, that's, um, Callum,

1013
00:58:51.165 --> 00:58:52.248
when he was a baby
with his dad.


1014
00:58:52.332 --> 00:58:53.373
- Oh, right.
- Yeah.


1015
00:58:54.207 --> 00:58:55.915
Michelle's dad's Kulvinder.

1016
00:58:57.207 --> 00:58:58.457
My dad were all right
with Kulvinder,


1017
00:58:58.540 --> 00:59:00.832
but he stopped talking to me
when I got with Paul.


1018
00:59:00.957 --> 00:59:02.040
My dad hated the British.

1019
00:59:04.207 --> 00:59:05.665
Callum blames me
for him dying.


1020
00:59:05.748 --> 00:59:07.665
He says his drinking got worse
when I left him,


1021
00:59:07.748 --> 00:59:08.998
but I had to leave him.

1022
00:59:11.082 --> 00:59:13.290
- So, here you go.
- Yeah, right.


1023
00:59:13.373 --> 00:59:15.415
- Night.
- Yeah, night.


1024
01:00:35.123 --> 01:00:36.123
What's up?

1025
01:00:37.957 --> 01:00:40.040
- Can we talk?
- Yeah.


1026
01:00:55.498 --> 01:00:57.373
Sometimes I just can't
switch off.


1027
01:02:04.082 --> 01:02:05.165
What's up?

1028
01:02:08.415 --> 01:02:09.790
I shouldn't have let you stay.

1029
01:02:10.748 --> 01:02:11.707
Why?

1030
01:02:12.748 --> 01:02:13.748
Cos of Runa?

1031
01:02:18.123 --> 01:02:19.165
Yeah.

1032
01:02:34.582 --> 01:02:35.665
It's okay.

1033
01:02:37.540 --> 01:02:39.290
We're not doing anyone
any harm.


1034
01:02:41.498 --> 01:02:42.498
Yeah?

1035
01:02:42.748 --> 01:02:43.790
- Yeah.
- Yeah.


1036

All right.

1037
01:02:47.123 --> 01:02:48.415
I did ask
for scrambled, but...
