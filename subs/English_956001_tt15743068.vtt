[Kallie]
I had a late night.


498

Yeah, I saw your light on...

499
00:31:35.739 --> 00:31:37.279
Couldn't sleep.

Couldn't get
comfortable in my bed.


501

Anyway, I was just
stopping by to...


502
00:31:41.530 --> 00:31:42.945
[Kallie] Listen Jackson.
I can't talk.


503
00:31:42.946 --> 00:31:45.154
I'm really far behind.

504
00:31:45.155 --> 00:31:47.155
Anything I can do to help?

505
00:31:48.197 --> 00:31:50.238
You want to help?

506
00:31:51.655 --> 00:31:54.363
Can't a person be neighborly?

507
00:31:55.322 --> 00:31:56.904
All right.
[chuckles]


508
00:31:56.905 --> 00:31:58.739
I could use some
help in the kitchen.


509
00:32:01.238 --> 00:32:02.946
[Jackson]
The kitchen?


510
00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:13.196
So, where did the name Goddess
Goats come from anyway?


511
00:32:13.197 --> 00:32:18.321
Well, it was rumored
that Cleopatra


512
00:32:18.322 --> 00:32:20.738
used goat's milk in
her beauty regime.


513
00:32:20.739 --> 00:32:24.738
So, my grandma always had
one goat named 'Cleo'


514
00:32:24.739 --> 00:32:26.862
in her honor.
[chuckles]


515
00:32:26.863 --> 00:32:30.154
Okay! These are your
grandmother's recipes.


516
00:32:30.155 --> 00:32:32.112
I've tweaked them.

517
00:32:32.113 --> 00:32:36.447
Added a few things, but yeah.

518
00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:40.446
My mother had eczema as a
child so my grandmother


519
00:32:40.447 --> 00:32:46.404
put goat's milk in the
bath and it really helped.


520
00:32:46.405 --> 00:32:47.945
Hmm...

521
00:32:47.946 --> 00:32:50.904
So she started making products
for friends and neighbors.


522
00:32:50.905 --> 00:32:53.362
So farming's been in your
family for generations?


523
00:32:53.363 --> 00:32:58.571
Five generations were raised in
the house that you're living in.


524
00:32:58.572 --> 00:33:01.863
My grandmother moved over here
when my parents got married.


525
00:33:03.697 --> 00:33:06.529
Look, I didn't mean to
acquire your childhood home.


526
00:33:06.530 --> 00:33:07.904
Your mom said...

527
00:33:07.905 --> 00:33:09.820
I like living here.

528
00:33:09.821 --> 00:33:13.196
I actually renovated this place
to make it a shared space


529
00:33:13.197 --> 00:33:17.030
for the farm workers
with... My dad.


530
00:33:18.197 --> 00:33:20.738

Don't you dare.

I couldn't if I wanted to.

it from the library,

fit among the others?

It's not the historical theme.
It's not nautical.

So, it could be
either of the two men?

someone's thinking about me.

And you have no idea who's
sending them to you?

helps to solve the mystery.

having a great time.


961
01:00:51.238 --> 01:00:54.613
As we all know, there's been
quite a little mystery buzzing


962
01:00:54.614 --> 01:00:57.488
around town the last few weeks.

963
01:00:57.489 --> 01:01:00.362
Kallie's love letters have made

964
01:01:00.363 --> 01:01:02.446
an exciting topic
of conversation.


965
01:01:02.447 --> 01:01:05.279
But I think it's time we
solve this little mystery.


966
01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:06.738
What do y'all think?

967
01:01:06.739 --> 01:01:08.572
[whispers]
What do we do?


968
01:01:09.322 --> 01:01:11.446
Sneak out now while we
still have the chance?


969
01:01:11.447 --> 01:01:13.154
I thought it was over.

970
01:01:13.155 --> 01:01:14.862
I thought it was.

971
01:01:14.863 --> 01:01:18.071
[Alison on mic] Who is our
mysterious love letter sender?


972
01:01:18.572 --> 01:01:20.280
Dex?

973
01:01:23.363 --> 01:01:25.405
[Alison on mic]
Dr. Grant?


974
01:01:26.447 --> 01:01:28.863
[Alison on mic] Come on now.
Don't be shy.


975
01:01:30.697 --> 01:01:36.237
Or maybe there's
another gentleman,


976
01:01:36.238 --> 01:01:38.945
a neighbor even,

977
01:01:38.946 --> 01:01:41.739
putting his heart on the page.

978
01:01:58.489 --> 01:02:01.197
It was us sending the letters.

979
01:02:11.863 --> 01:02:14.697
Well...
Mystery solved.


980
01:02:25.197 --> 01:02:27.155
Mom...

981
01:02:29.447 --> 01:02:33.654
I'm not entirely surprised
that you're behind this.


982
01:02:33.655 --> 01:02:36.446
But Sahara?
You were in on this?


983
01:02:36.447 --> 01:02:38.029
Darlin'...

984
01:02:38.030 --> 01:02:39.945
It wasn't supposed
to go this far.


985
01:02:39.946 --> 01:02:41.987
How was it supposed to go?

986
01:02:41.988 --> 01:02:46.279
We just wanted you to get
away from the farm more.


987
01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:49.862
You know, explore
mysteries in your own life.


988
01:02:49.863 --> 01:02:53.113
Possibly fall in love.

989
01:02:53.905 --> 01:02:55.988
[Kallie]
Get away from the farm?


990
01:02:57.238 --> 01:02:58.821
The way you have?

991
01:03:01.030 --> 01:03:04.572
I had no choice but to move on.

992
01:03:06.697 --> 01:03:09.780
Life doesn't always
give you the option.


993
01:03:13.821 --> 01:03:18.112
I loved your father and
I lost him far too soon.


994
01:03:18.113 --> 01:03:19.862
I'm just...

995
01:03:19.863 --> 01:03:22.404
Making the best I can of
things the only way I know how.


996
01:03:22.405 --> 01:03:24.987
By selling the farm?
Dad's farm.


997
01:03:24.988 --> 01:03:28.070
And leaving behind
all our memories?


998
01:03:28.071 --> 01:03:30.154
I didn't leave any
memories behind.


999
01:03:30.155 --> 01:03:32.113
I took them with me.

1000
01:03:34.821 --> 01:03:37.821
All the important things
are still right here.


1001
01:03:39.821 --> 01:03:43.862
Well, I'm glad you got
to decide for yourself


1002
01:03:43.863 --> 01:03:47.321
what to take and what to leave.

1003
01:03:47.322 --> 01:03:49.363
[Sahara]
Kallie! Wait!


1004
01:03:51.946 --> 01:03:53.405
I got it.

1005
01:03:59.821 --> 01:04:01.279
[Jackson]
Hey, wait up.


1006
01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:02.404
Kallie!

1007
01:04:02.405 --> 01:04:04.404
[Kallie]
I just want to go home.


1008
01:04:04.405 --> 01:04:07.363
Look, at least all this
is really over now.


1009
01:04:11.821 --> 01:04:13.363
[Jackson]
It's over.


1010
01:04:20.030 --> 01:04:22.654
I was just

1011
01:04:22.655 --> 01:04:29.405
humiliated in front
of the whole town.


1012
01:04:31.530 --> 01:04:33.363
Not the whole town.

1013
01:04:35.030 --> 01:04:37.405
How could they do this to me?
[sobs]


1014
01:04:41.030 --> 01:04:43.905
I did an interview...

1015
01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:51.572
This is mortifying.

1016
01:04:52.614 --> 01:04:55.613
And Dex and Grant were
probably so confused.


1017
01:04:55.614 --> 01:04:58.446
Dex and Grant were having
as much fun as you were.


1018
01:04:58.447 --> 01:05:00.029
They enjoyed the attention.

1019
01:05:00.030 --> 01:05:02.363
I wouldn't worry about them.

1020
01:05:03.155 --> 01:05:04.738
Hey.

1021
01:05:04.739 --> 01:05:06.405
Okay?

1022
01:05:09.447 --> 01:05:12.112
Look, Sahara told me your mom
and her were just trying to help


1023
01:05:12.113 --> 01:05:14.489
because they love you.

1024
01:05:21.863 --> 01:05:23.655
Jackson...

1025
01:05:26.572 --> 01:05:29.322
Did you know about this?

1026
01:05:34.071 --> 01:05:35.446
I caught Sahara
trying to deliver


1027
01:05:35.447 --> 01:05:37.112
the final letter last night.

1028
01:05:37.113 --> 01:05:40.572
I wanted to know who it was so
I camped out by your mailbox.


1029
01:05:42.405 --> 01:05:45.987
And you didn't think to share
this knowledge with me?


1030
01:05:45.988 --> 01:05:47.529
Look, I didn't think
it was my place.


1031
01:05:47.530 --> 01:05:49.404
I thought we were friends.

1032
01:05:49.405 --> 01:05:50.571
Well, we are.

1033
01:05:50.572 --> 01:05:52.362
We're more than that.

1034
01:05:52.363 --> 01:05:53.820
You should have told me.

1035
01:05:53.821 --> 01:05:55.613
They were going to

1036
01:05:55.614 --> 01:05:57.404
and they said they weren't
going to send any more letters.


1037
01:05:57.405 --> 01:05:59.862
Look, you need to know

1038
01:05:59.863 --> 01:06:03.904
how lucky you are to have people
who care so much about you.


1039
01:06:03.905 --> 01:06:05.904
People who would go to those,

1040
01:06:05.905 --> 01:06:08.696
albeit crazy lengths,
to see you find happiness.


1041
01:06:08.697 --> 01:06:10.488
I was happy!

1042
01:06:10.489 --> 01:06:14.738
My quiet, simple, predictable
life suited me just fine.


1043
01:06:14.739 --> 01:06:16.987
You were probably just

1044
01:06:16.988 --> 01:06:21.154
hoping I'd fall in love so
I would sell you my land,


1045
01:06:21.155 --> 01:06:23.196
while I was whisked away to

Look no.

1048
01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:28.779
I was hoping you'd fall in love.
That parts true...

And stupid me!

for you to start

What do you mean?

Truth is...

when I fell in love
with your father.

Your father and I had
gone to school together

01:22:20.780 --> 01:22:24.447
I would only ever be half happy.

1274
01:22:25.238 --> 01:22:27.655
No. I was...

1275
01:22:29.946 --> 01:22:36.112
I was closed off
for a long time.


1276
01:22:36.113 --> 01:22:41.946
It was hard for me to tell
you how I felt for you.


1277
01:22:43.946 --> 01:22:48.446
But I don't care about
your land, Kallie.


1278
01:22:48.447 --> 01:22:50.988
I care about you.

1279
01:22:54.155 --> 01:22:57.738
I'm in love with you.

1280
01:22:57.739 --> 01:23:01.363
And I want to make you
happy the whole way down.


1281
01:23:02.155 --> 01:23:05.362
I'm in love with you, too.
