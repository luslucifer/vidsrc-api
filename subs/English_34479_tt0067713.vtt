00:04:03.822 --> 00:04:06.437
(Latin rite)

2
00:04:17.835 --> 00:04:18.950
It's Joanna.

3
00:04:19.557 --> 00:04:20.671
Shall we never be free?

4
00:04:21.196 --> 00:04:23.231
We know where the evil lies.

5
00:04:24.875 --> 00:04:27.912
We must free ourselves...now!

6
00:04:28.275 --> 00:04:29.024
No, my son.

7
00:04:29.355 --> 00:04:30.752
It will soon be dark.

8
00:04:32.034 --> 00:04:32.864
Then...

9
00:04:33.274 --> 00:04:34.550
...we must hurry.

10
00:04:35.394 --> 00:04:36.349
Maria...

11
00:04:36.913 --> 00:04:38.904
take the other women
to the church.


12
00:04:40.833 --> 00:04:42.060
And stay there!

13
00:04:43.033 --> 00:04:44.591
My son, I beg you not to go.

14
00:04:44.832 --> 00:04:46.822
Your violence will only
lead to further violence!


15
00:04:47.072 --> 00:04:50.064
Father, this evil
must be destroyed!


16
00:04:53.112 --> 00:04:54.863
Then I will go with you...

17
00:04:55.951 --> 00:04:58.340
...and may Heaven protect us all!

18
00:05:34.427 --> 00:05:36.004
(Latin rite)

19
00:06:12.502 --> 00:06:13.777
Get behind the rocks!

20
00:06:18.821 --> 00:06:20.141
Stay out of sight.

21
00:06:46.418 --> 00:06:48.699
Open the door.
I've something for you.


22
00:06:49.977 --> 00:06:51.298
Go on, open up!

23
00:07:00.017 --> 00:07:01.574
I'm quite alone!

24
00:07:02.736 --> 00:07:03.851
Open up!

25
00:07:24.134 --> 00:07:25.088
Open the door!

26
00:07:26.094 --> 00:07:27.163
Come on, open it!

27
00:07:40.453 --> 00:07:43.151
Stay where you are
or you'll get hurt!


28
00:07:51.291 --> 00:07:54.918
You fools! You think you
can destroy my master?!


29
00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:57.726
The flames will never reach him!

30
00:08:24.047 --> 00:08:26.277
Burn it down!

31
00:09:00.282 --> 00:09:01.431
Torch!

32
00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:15.276
That's enough! 
That's enough!

33
00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:16.511
We're going back!

34
00:09:47.395 --> 00:09:49.387
Good! Come on, then.

35
00:09:56.117 --> 00:09:59.313
We must give thanks to
our Savior for His protection.


36
00:09:59.555 --> 00:10:04.241
Let us go to the church and tell
our loved ones they are safe.


37
00:10:50.549 --> 00:10:52.509
Maria.

38
00:11:04.827 --> 00:11:06.704
The devil has won.

39
00:11:21.506 --> 00:11:22.780
Friends of Sarah.

40
00:11:23.305 --> 00:11:25.216
I would like to propose
a toast to Sarah.


41
00:11:27.345 --> 00:11:30.811
A very happy birthday
and many happy returns.


42
00:11:37.664 --> 00:11:39.097
And to you.

43
00:11:39.502 --> 00:11:40.252
Speech! Speech!

44
00:11:40.863 --> 00:11:42.137
Reply! Reply!

45
00:11:42.382 --> 00:11:44.977
- You must reply.
- Speech! Speech!


46
00:11:46.012 --> 00:11:46.785
No.

47
00:11:46.902 --> 00:11:49.509
We insist, don't we?

48
00:11:49.742 --> 00:11:51.094
Good luck, Sarah!

49
00:11:51.095 --> 00:11:52.096
Ah...

50
00:11:54.022 --> 00:11:56.856
Thank you. Thank you all very much.

51
00:11:59.942 --> 00:12:00.929
Great speech!

52
00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:02.654
Yes, nice and short.

53
00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:06.065
Now you can cut that cake!

54
00:12:22.979 --> 00:12:24.252
Simon, where is your brother?

55
00:12:25.059 --> 00:12:26.806
Where is Paul?

56
00:12:27.297 --> 00:12:28.889
He can't have just
forgotten, can he?


57
00:12:29.179 --> 00:12:30.735
No, he wouldn't have forgotten.

58
00:12:30.978 --> 00:12:32.774
I expect he's just working late.

59
00:12:37.097 --> 00:12:38.529
Was it good, darling?

60
00:12:42.097 --> 00:12:44.655
Paul? Was it good?

61
00:12:47.456 --> 00:12:50.287
Oh, yes. What time is it?

62
00:12:50.655 --> 00:12:52.326
Was it the best ever?

63
00:12:53.175 --> 00:12:55.609
Best ever. What's the time?

64
00:12:55.855 --> 00:12:57.252
Oh, it's early.

65
00:13:00.254 --> 00:13:01.686
Why do you want to know?

66
00:13:01.934 --> 00:13:03.161
Got to go.

67
00:13:03.413 --> 00:13:04.733
Go where?

68
00:13:05.214 --> 00:13:06.884
To some other girl?!

69
00:13:06.885 --> 00:13:07.886
No.

70
00:13:08.133 --> 00:13:09.202
Where, then?

71
00:13:10.292 --> 00:13:11.613
Night school.

72
00:13:11.853 --> 00:13:12.922
What?

73
00:13:13.172 --> 00:13:15.562
I'm trying to improve myself.

74
00:13:16.211 --> 00:13:18.725
You couldn't
improve yourself, darling.


75
00:13:21.011 --> 00:13:22.764
The times I've lain here...

76
00:13:23.012 --> 00:13:26.286
...all by myself, listening
to that silly clock chiming


77
00:13:26.691 --> 00:13:29.125
wishing I could have
someone beside me.


78
00:13:29.369 --> 00:13:30.359
- Someone like you.
- Seven...


79
00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:33.408
- Now my wish has come true.
- Eight...


80
00:13:33.650 --> 00:13:34.604
Nine.

81
00:13:37.248 --> 00:13:40.048
Nine! I thought you
said it was early!


82
00:13:40.288 --> 00:13:41.358
It is.

83
00:13:44.009 --> 00:13:45.840
Come on, forget night school.

84
00:13:46.848 --> 00:13:48.361
Can't. Late already.

85
00:13:49.129 --> 00:13:50.960
Don't go. Stay here with me.

86
00:13:51.608 --> 00:13:52.517
Can't.

87
00:13:53.007 --> 00:13:54.042
I say you must!

88
00:13:55.166 --> 00:13:56.044
Sorry.

89
00:13:56.287 --> 00:13:58.291
I shall scream.

90
00:13:58.967 --> 00:14:00.241
Now, don't be silly.

91
00:14:02.727 --> 00:14:03.636
What's that?

92
00:14:04.008 --> 00:14:05.359
A present for your teacher?

93
00:14:05.726 --> 00:14:07.602
I don't believe you are
going to night school!


94
00:14:08.006 --> 00:14:09.802
You're going to meet
another girl, aren't you?!


95
00:14:10.045 --> 00:14:11.195
Not so loud!

96
00:14:11.525 --> 00:14:12.675
I hate you!

97
00:14:12.926 --> 00:14:15.139
Hate! Hate! Hate!

98
00:14:17.325 --> 00:14:18.200
Come back!

99
00:14:25.163 --> 00:14:26.118
Come back!

100
00:14:28.003 --> 00:14:29.834
I'm not going to let you go!

101
00:14:33.322 --> 00:14:34.073
Father!

102
00:14:35.322 --> 00:14:36.039
Alice!

103
00:14:37.004 --> 00:14:38.573
He attacked me.

104
00:14:39.602 --> 00:14:41.115
Came in though my
bedroom window!


105
00:14:42.482 --> 00:14:44.118
You young swine!

106
00:14:44.802 --> 00:14:45.836
He tried to...

107
00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:48.661
...interfere with me.

108
00:14:49.201 --> 00:14:50.110
What?

109
00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:51.713
Rapist!

110
00:14:52.161 --> 00:14:53.149
Look, I...

111
00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:55.831
...I must be going.

112
00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:57.469
Excuse me, sir.

113
00:14:59.642 --> 00:15:02.133
Get after him, you fools!

114
00:15:02.358 --> 00:15:05.431
- Burgomaster!
- Get after him, you fools!


115
00:15:05.679 --> 00:15:08.556
Leave me! Get after him, you fools!

116
00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:13.596
Homosexual puppy.

117
00:15:13.839 --> 00:15:15.748
A spell in prison will cool him down.

118
00:15:16.558 --> 00:15:19.230
And now, young lady, I should
like a few words with you!


119
00:15:19.477 --> 00:15:21.228
Come back down here!

120
00:15:25.996 --> 00:15:27.396
Open this door!

121
00:15:31.916 --> 00:15:33.433
Lovely party, Sarah!

122
00:15:33.434 --> 00:15:36.791
Hope you're enjoying it
as much as we are!


123
00:15:37.435 --> 00:15:40.075
Oh! I'm thirsty!

124
00:15:41.915 --> 00:15:43.234
Well, are you?

125
00:15:43.874 --> 00:15:46.167
- Am I what?
- Enjoying your party?


126
00:15:46.168 --> 00:15:47.757
Oh, yes!

127
00:15:48.113 --> 00:15:50.722
Well, Happy Birthday, then.

128
00:15:51.043 --> 00:15:53.989
Oh! I nearly forgot.

129
00:15:56.632 --> 00:15:58.543
I didn't forget at all, really.

130
00:15:59.072 --> 00:16:01.107
Just waiting for the right moment.

131
00:16:05.272 --> 00:16:06.421
Oh, Simon...

132
00:16:07.192 --> 00:16:08.624
It's lovely!

133
00:16:09.751 --> 00:16:12.185
- It's only small, I'm afraid.
- No, it's lovely.


134
00:16:12.431 --> 00:16:13.385
Thank you, Simon.

135
00:16:16.231 --> 00:16:18.027
There. Look!

136
00:16:18.511 --> 00:16:22.177
I was hoping you'd
try it on the other hand.


137
00:16:23.709 --> 00:16:25.421
Is it Paul?

138
00:16:25.869 --> 00:16:28.100
- Ah! Here's Paul!
- Paul. You're late!


139
00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:31.982
Sarah. Simon. I really am sorry.

140
00:16:34.309 --> 00:16:36.105
Well, where have you been?

141
00:16:36.469 --> 00:16:39.107
As my older brother,
I suppose you have the right.


142
00:16:39.508 --> 00:16:42.624
I, um...had a meeting
with our burgomaster.


143
00:16:43.107 --> 00:16:44.016
Paul, you?

144
00:16:44.547 --> 00:16:47.279
In fact, I had great difficulty
persuading him to let me leave.


145
00:16:47.628 --> 00:16:48.503
You're fooling!

146
00:16:48.985 --> 00:16:50.625
Cross my heart.

147
00:16:51.075 --> 00:16:54.837
Oh...here.

148
00:16:55.586 --> 00:16:57.622
Many happy returns
of the day, Sarah.


149
00:17:01.545 --> 00:17:05.060
Just another example
of my photographic genius.


150
00:17:09.202 --> 00:17:12.879
Oh! Beautiful!

151
00:17:13.544 --> 00:17:17.910
I have to admit it. You have
a talent for photography.


152
00:17:19.062 --> 00:17:20.577
It's a very expensive frame.

153
00:17:20.903 --> 00:17:22.335
How can you afford it?

154
00:17:22.337 --> 00:17:23.980
Ah, I'm not a penniless student.

155
00:17:23.982 --> 00:17:27.018
Penniless now...but you wait,
when I'm a great lawyer...


156
00:17:27.422 --> 00:17:30.422
Then I'll take your photograph.

157
00:17:30.822 --> 00:17:32.574
Notice how the...

158
00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:35.217
Look what I've done.

159
00:17:35.462 --> 00:17:37.132
It doesn't matter. It's nothing.

160
00:17:37.381 --> 00:17:39.132
No, No. I'll fix it myself.

161
00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:40.608
Excuse me, sir!

162
00:17:44.141 --> 00:17:46.745
I think I'm going to
have to leave you.


163
00:17:49.453 --> 00:17:52.835
Excuse me, sir!
Excuse me, sir!


164
00:17:54.418 --> 00:17:55.694
Paul, what have you done now?

165
00:17:55.698 --> 00:17:56.936
Not again?!

166
00:17:56.978 --> 00:17:58.172
Sorry, Sarah.

167
00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:00.973
Happy Birthday!

168
00:18:04.504 --> 00:18:06.757
Hey! Hey!

169
00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:17.194
Hey!

170
00:18:50.361 --> 00:18:53.572
Whoa, boys! Whoa!

171
00:19:02.332 --> 00:19:04.078
Whoa!

172
00:19:27.903 --> 00:19:29.703
Whoa!

173
00:19:31.417 --> 00:19:33.351
Aaaaahhh!

174
00:19:40.727 --> 00:19:41.875
Good night, everybody!

175
00:19:42.127 --> 00:19:43.001
Thank you!

176
00:19:50.086 --> 00:19:51.518
Happy birthday.

177
00:19:51.924 --> 00:19:52.995
It was happy, wasn't it?

178
00:19:53.246 --> 00:19:54.439
The happiest.

179
00:19:54.685 --> 00:19:57.198
Thank you, for the party
and for everything else.


180
00:19:57.604 --> 00:20:00.357
It was a good party.
I know I enjoyed it.


181
00:20:01.725 --> 00:20:03.601
That makes it perfect, then.

182
00:20:08.043 --> 00:20:09.112
What's wrong?

183
00:20:09.842 --> 00:20:11.992
Paul... will he be alright?

184
00:20:12.523 --> 00:20:14.160
He always has been.

185
00:20:14.402 --> 00:20:16.155
It's not the first time
he's been in trouble.


186
00:20:16.403 --> 00:20:17.391
I know.

187
00:20:19.202 --> 00:20:20.793
He means that much to you?

188
00:20:23.122 --> 00:20:24.792
I'm attracted to him.

189
00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:26.793
So are other girls.

190
00:20:27.562 --> 00:20:29.753
I'm worried about him
because he's your brother,


191
00:20:29.756 --> 00:20:31.576
and I know how close you are.

192
00:20:31.577 --> 00:20:35.876
I don't want you to be hurt...ever.

193
00:21:19.778 --> 00:21:21.695
(knocks)

194
00:21:32.872 --> 00:21:34.101
What do you want?

195
00:21:34.952 --> 00:21:37.102
- Can you let me in?
- I'm sorry, we're closed.


196
00:21:37.952 --> 00:21:38.863
Yes, I see that, but...

197
00:21:39.113 --> 00:21:40.102
I'm sorry, really.

198
00:21:40.912 --> 00:21:41.707
Where can I go, then?

199
00:21:41.991 --> 00:21:43.062
Well...

200
00:21:43.593 --> 00:21:45.504
There isn't anywhere.
Not in this village.


201
00:21:45.752 --> 00:21:47.629
The next village is 10 miles away.

202
00:21:47.872 --> 00:21:50.668
There's nowhere else for
miles around. Except the castle.


203
00:21:50.910 --> 00:21:51.945
Do they do bed and breakfast?

204
00:21:52.271 --> 00:21:54.659
You can't go there. You mustn't.

205
00:21:54.763 --> 00:21:56.149
Oh? Why not?

206
00:21:56.151 --> 00:21:59.227
I don't know. I'm new here.
But you mustn't go there,


207
00:21:59.228 --> 00:22:01.552
not at night, anyway.

208
00:22:01.682 --> 00:22:03.620
Just have to bed down here, then.

209
00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:05.780
You can't do that.
You'll catch your death!


210
00:22:06.030 --> 00:22:07.144
Possibly...

211
00:22:07.388 --> 00:22:10.317
...but what alternative is there?

212
00:22:10.748 --> 00:22:11.703
Wait a minute.

213
00:22:50.863 --> 00:22:53.173
We always close when it gets dark.

214
00:22:53.175 --> 00:22:54.471
Oh? Why?

215
00:22:54.944 --> 00:22:56.819
I do not know.

216
00:22:57.063 --> 00:23:00.214
Nobody here opens up after dark.

217
00:23:01.263 --> 00:23:02.979
Couldn't you stretch a point?

218
00:23:03.221 --> 00:23:04.450
Just once?

219
00:23:05.101 --> 00:23:08.493
I've come a long way,
and I'm tired...and hungry.


220
00:23:08.782 --> 00:23:12.296
I can give you a bite to eat.
Won't be much, mind.


221
00:23:12.819 --> 00:23:15.415
- And a room?
- Sorry, there aren't any.


222
00:23:16.821 --> 00:23:18.139
What about a bed?

223
00:23:18.381 --> 00:23:19.336
There isn't one.

224
00:23:20.541 --> 00:23:22.068
I don't mind sharing.

225
00:23:22.501 --> 00:23:23.694
I bet you don't.

226
00:23:24.379 --> 00:23:26.415
I don't mean to get you
into trouble, of course.


227
00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:29.733
Oh, you wouldn't.
I'd see to that.


228
00:23:33.619 --> 00:23:34.971
I'm very tired.

229
00:23:36.139 --> 00:23:38.927
I'd be off as soon as
my head touched the pillow.


230
00:23:39.177 --> 00:23:40.896
Oh yeah, I've heard that before.

231
00:23:41.138 --> 00:23:42.287
True.

232
00:23:43.457 --> 00:23:45.494
I can hardly keep awake now.

233
00:23:45.737 --> 00:23:47.773
I thought you said you was hungry.

234
00:23:48.736 --> 00:23:49.692
I am.

235
00:23:50.135 --> 00:23:52.890
Well, make up your mind.

236
00:23:57.849 --> 00:23:59.325
What are you doing here?!

237
00:23:59.576 --> 00:24:01.478
How did he get in?!

238
00:24:02.055 --> 00:24:05.207
He's a traveler got lost.
I let him in.


239
00:24:05.209 --> 00:24:07.564
I told you never to open
that door after dark!


240
00:24:07.814 --> 00:24:09.566
- It wasn't her fault. It was...
- Get out!


241
00:24:09.814 --> 00:24:11.373
Please let me explain, I...

242
00:24:11.374 --> 00:24:13.262
(horses approaching)

243
00:24:16.989 --> 00:24:18.798
(hoofbeats fade)

244
00:24:26.212 --> 00:24:27.712
Out!

245
00:24:36.372 --> 00:24:37.805
Well, thanks for nothing.

246
00:24:38.291 --> 00:24:41.661
I only hope the castle
is more hospitable.


247
00:24:44.131 --> 00:24:45.450
He's going to the castle!

248
00:24:45.931 --> 00:24:49.282
He can go to hell as far as
I'm concerned. Get to bed!


249
00:24:49.290 --> 00:24:50.166
But I...

250
00:24:50.410 --> 00:24:52.443
Get to bed!

251
00:26:25.479 --> 00:26:26.978
Gidup.

252
00:28:17.944 --> 00:28:18.900
Are you hurt?

253
00:28:20.818 --> 00:28:25.711
No...at least I don't think so.

254
00:28:25.943 --> 00:28:27.443
Come.

255
00:28:49.701 --> 00:28:50.894
You are hurt.

256
00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:53.018
No. I just sprained it a little.

257
00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:54.979
You're cold.

258
00:28:56.220 --> 00:28:58.637
Go over to the fire.

259
00:29:07.099 --> 00:29:08.897
- Is this your...
- Are you hungry?


260
00:29:09.339 --> 00:29:10.639
Would you like some food?

261
00:29:11.099 --> 00:29:11.894
Well, it's late.

262
00:29:12.298 --> 00:29:13.650
I don't want to put you
to any trouble.


263
00:29:14.179 --> 00:29:15.733
But I am rather tired.

264
00:29:15.738 --> 00:29:17.703
I'll have a bed prepared.

265
00:29:17.705 --> 00:29:19.397
Wait.

266
00:29:37.255 --> 00:29:39.952
<i>The blade is very sharp.</i>

267
00:29:42.814 --> 00:29:45.585
I'm sorry. I'm not an intruder.

268
00:29:48.931 --> 00:29:52.248
I realize it must look
like it, but I'm not.

269
00:29:52.373 --> 00:29:53.489
The girl, eh...

270
00:29:54.094 --> 00:29:55.765
...young lady invited me in.

271
00:29:56.014 --> 00:29:57.605
She's gone to arrainge a bed for me.

272
00:29:58.133 --> 00:30:03.240
- But if I'm not welcome...
- But...you are welcome.


273
00:30:03.412 --> 00:30:06.132
Before the castle was destroyed,

274
00:30:06.372 --> 00:30:08.363
strangers were always welcome.

275
00:30:09.053 --> 00:30:11.188
Please be seated.

276
00:30:11.691 --> 00:30:14.125
While your room is being prepared...

277
00:30:14.851 --> 00:30:18.011
...you will take some wine?

278
00:30:19.530 --> 00:30:21.470
You have some beautiful things here.

279
00:30:21.890 --> 00:30:23.949
All that is left.

280
00:30:26.289 --> 00:30:27.327
What happened, exactly...

281
00:30:27.330 --> 00:30:29.617
...to the castle?

282
00:30:40.566 --> 00:30:43.844
May I introduce myself?
My name is Carlson - Paul Carlson.


283
00:30:44.089 --> 00:30:46.198
This is Tania.

284
00:30:47.327 --> 00:30:49.132
I am Dracula.

285
00:30:52.686 --> 00:30:54.439
I'm sure I'm putting you
to a great deal of trouble.


286
00:30:55.007 --> 00:30:56.006
Your wine?

287
00:30:56.126 --> 00:30:57.714
No, no, thank you.
I really must be going.


288
00:30:58.173 --> 00:30:59.503
Going?

289
00:30:59.646 --> 00:31:00.635
Well, yes...

290
00:31:02.324 --> 00:31:03.599
You must stay here.

291
00:31:03.846 --> 00:31:06.040
It's very kind of you, but I
can't bother you any longer.


292
00:31:06.405 --> 00:31:07.883
I'm sure I'll find a place to stay.

293
00:31:08.566 --> 00:31:10.317
There is no where else.

294
00:31:10.884 --> 00:31:12.796
Well, I'm a good walker.

295
00:31:13.523 --> 00:31:15.037
And my ankle is feeling better.

296
00:31:15.284 --> 00:31:17.901
This is not Kleinenberg,

297
00:31:18.762 --> 00:31:21.436
You are not aquainted
with the countryside here.


298
00:31:22.202 --> 00:31:24.754
How did you know
I was from Kleinenberg?


299
00:31:25.604 --> 00:31:30.612
You will accompany Mr Carlson,
and show him to his room.


300
00:31:32.921 --> 00:31:36.029
Thank you for your hospitality.

301
00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:43.270
Well, good night then.

302
00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:46.542
Sleep well, Mr. Carlson.

303
00:33:20.789 --> 00:33:24.937
You're not going to believe a
word of this when I get back, Sarah.


304
00:33:28.355 --> 00:33:30.241
(scraping)

305
00:33:37.855 --> 00:33:39.727
Who is it?

306
00:33:57.948 --> 00:34:00.097
Listen!

307
00:34:02.383 --> 00:34:03.374
Wolves.

308
00:34:03.864 --> 00:34:07.675
They are free...free to
wander as they please.


309
00:34:07.904 --> 00:34:09.223
If only I were free.

310
00:34:09.822 --> 00:34:10.908
You?

311
00:34:10.943 --> 00:34:12.580
I am a prisoner here.

312
00:34:13.302 --> 00:34:14.736
There's nobody I can turn to.

313
00:34:15.142 --> 00:34:16.780
Nobody I can talk to.

314
00:34:18.702 --> 00:34:19.532
Please, help me.

315
00:34:20.261 --> 00:34:21.411
Please.

316
00:34:22.141 --> 00:34:23.641
Hold me!

317
00:34:41.739 --> 00:34:43.238
Love me.

318
00:34:51.617 --> 00:34:53.117
Love me!

319
00:37:25.119 --> 00:37:26.075
Help!!

320
00:37:27.599 --> 00:37:30.434
Help!! Somebody help me!!

321
00:39:57.316 --> 00:40:00.219
Hey! Hey up there, help!

322
00:40:01.301 --> 00:40:05.041
There's no way out! Help!

323
00:40:38.257 --> 00:40:39.450
Wine, landlord!

324
00:40:40.017 --> 00:40:42.133
- Are you paying?
- Here on official business.


325
00:40:42.376 --> 00:40:46.449
- You can have a beer each.
- We got wine at the last place.


326
00:40:46.696 --> 00:40:48.253
Then, you'd better go back
to the last place.


327
00:40:48.496 --> 00:40:49.689
We'll take it.

328
00:40:49.935 --> 00:40:51.935
Do you know what this is?

329
00:40:53.335 --> 00:40:55.054
- It's a warrent.
- A warrent.


330
00:40:55.296 --> 00:40:56.444
For an arrest!

331
00:40:56.446 --> 00:40:58.245
You know who it's for?

332
00:40:58.495 --> 00:40:59.928
So long as it's not for me.

333
00:41:00.695 --> 00:41:02.092
No, it's not for you.

334
00:41:02.333 --> 00:41:04.051
It's for the arrest of a young man...

335
00:41:04.533 --> 00:41:05.807
...from Kleinenberg.

336
00:41:07.814 --> 00:41:10.043
You know what he done?

337
00:41:20.932 --> 00:41:22.251
That's what he done.

338
00:41:22.570 --> 00:41:24.960
And to the burgomaster's daughter.

339
00:41:25.211 --> 00:41:26.280
The burgomaster.

340
00:41:27.372 --> 00:41:29.043
Well, are you expecting
to find him here?


341
00:41:29.971 --> 00:41:32.086
Not here exactly, but he
might have passed through here.


342
00:41:32.331 --> 00:41:33.649
We tried everywhere else.

343
00:41:34.330 --> 00:41:36.560
Our orders are to make a thorough search.

344
00:41:36.810 --> 00:41:37.764
Search everywhere.

345
00:41:37.767 --> 00:41:39.248
He's not here.

346
00:41:39.250 --> 00:41:41.927
I know he's not here now,
but has he been here?


347
00:41:41.930 --> 00:41:44.615
There was a young man tried
to get in here last night.


348
00:41:44.616 --> 00:41:45.615
Ah!

349
00:41:46.410 --> 00:41:49.923
I sent him away. It was dark.
I didn't know who he was.


350
00:41:50.529 --> 00:41:51.802
- Wise.
- Where did he go?


351
00:41:52.769 --> 00:41:55.521
I've no idea. And I care less.

352
00:41:55.765 --> 00:41:57.827
I've got work to do.

353
00:41:58.368 --> 00:42:00.367
You want to know where he went?

354
00:42:02.368 --> 00:42:04.163
I'll tell you where he went.

355
00:42:04.687 --> 00:42:05.641
To the castle!

356
00:42:05.887 --> 00:42:07.161
That's where he went.

357
00:42:07.766 --> 00:42:08.766
Castle?

358
00:42:09.245 --> 00:42:10.759
Yeah. It's a long way from here,

359
00:42:11.007 --> 00:42:12.757
but that's where he went.

360
00:42:13.565 --> 00:42:14.565
Long way.

361
00:42:14.651 --> 00:42:16.514
Oh...long way.

362
00:42:17.246 --> 00:42:19.745
You said your orders were
to search everywhere.


363
00:42:20.524 --> 00:42:24.312
Fact is, that's really outside
our territory, you might say.


364
00:42:24.365 --> 00:42:26.800
Oh yeah...well outside.

365
00:42:27.204 --> 00:42:29.956
But we'll report the matter, never fear.

366
00:42:30.203 --> 00:42:31.636
We'll make a report.

367
00:42:32.043 --> 00:42:34.542
He won't get away with it.
We'll see to that.


368
00:42:42.802 --> 00:42:43.838
Lazy pigs!

369
00:42:44.123 --> 00:42:45.112
Is that true, my child?

370
00:42:45.921 --> 00:42:46.750
What say, Father?

371
00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:48.832
About the young man.
He went to the castle?


372
00:42:49.215 --> 00:42:51.001
Yes, it's true, Father.

373
00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:57.047
Then, Heaven protect his immortal soul.

374
00:44:03.551 --> 00:44:05.427
It certainly isn't like Paul
to disappear like this.


375
00:44:05.428 --> 00:44:06.924
Not for so long.

376
00:44:06.925 --> 00:44:10.230
Or he's in more trouble. I know it.

377
00:44:10.712 --> 00:44:13.226
If he'd had an accident,
we would have heard something.


378
00:44:13.471 --> 00:44:16.429
Oh, I don't know.
I only know I'm worried.


379
00:44:17.589 --> 00:44:19.865
We don't know that anything
bad has happened to him.


380
00:44:20.112 --> 00:44:22.544
Then, where is he? Where?

381
00:44:23.150 --> 00:44:27.746
We'll find out. The man at the frontier
said he had come this way.


382
00:45:00.264 --> 00:45:02.097
This is as far as I go.

383
00:45:02.942 --> 00:45:04.858
Then, thank you for the ride.

384
00:45:05.489 --> 00:45:06.895
Will you be staying here?

385
00:45:07.145 --> 00:45:09.705
That I won't! I'm going to
get back as soon as ever I can!


386
00:45:09.946 --> 00:45:11.537
As soon as I've unloaded those.

387
00:45:12.064 --> 00:45:13.702
Before dark, anyway.

388
00:45:13.945 --> 00:45:17.943
I wouldn't advise you to
stay here too long, either.


389
00:45:18.144 --> 00:45:18.861
Why not?

390
00:45:19.504 --> 00:45:21.573
There's been a lot of trouble here.

391
00:45:21.597 --> 00:45:23.930
Anyway, it's no place for a young lady.

392
00:45:24.902 --> 00:45:26.302
Well, wait a moment, won't you?

393
00:45:26.304 --> 00:45:28.772
I'll just talk to them here,
and then we'll come back with you.


394
00:45:29.036 --> 00:45:30.575
I'll wait for nobody.

395
00:45:31.022 --> 00:45:32.057
I'm going.

396
00:45:32.742 --> 00:45:35.539
- At least take the young lady back!
- No, I want to stay.


397
00:45:36.781 --> 00:45:38.259
Come on, that's a good boy.

398
00:45:39.260 --> 00:45:41.192
We've come a long way today.

399
00:45:41.193 --> 00:45:44.282
If you don't go back with him,
you may not get back tonight,


400
00:45:44.339 --> 00:45:45.740
and they'll be worried about you.

401
00:45:45.981 --> 00:45:49.053
I am not leaving without you and Paul.

402
00:45:49.300 --> 00:45:50.528
Please, Sarah!

403
00:45:50.860 --> 00:45:53.054
I'm staying with you, Simon.

404
00:45:58.499 --> 00:46:01.499
Let's see if they know
anything about Paul here.


405
00:46:14.976 --> 00:46:15.888
Good afternoon.

406
00:46:16.138 --> 00:46:17.251
Good afternoon.

407
00:46:18.056 --> 00:46:20.012
May we have something to eat, please?

408
00:46:20.255 --> 00:46:23.247
I could get you some
soup and some cheese.


409
00:46:23.495 --> 00:46:25.875
- Are you just passing through?
- Yes.


410
00:46:25.895 --> 00:46:26.850
Oh, good.

411
00:46:27.174 --> 00:46:28.290
Julie!

412
00:46:28.536 --> 00:46:31.003
- A stein of beer while you're waiting?
- For me yes, please.


413
00:46:31.254 --> 00:46:34.213
And a brandy. We've been traveling all day.

414
00:46:34.577 --> 00:46:40.077
Oh, Julie! Lay the table up for this
gentleman and his lady, will you?


415
00:46:43.254 --> 00:46:44.772
Students, are you, sir?

416
00:46:45.252 --> 00:46:46.288
On vacation?

417
00:46:46.878 --> 00:46:49.483
Hope you're enjoying yourself.

418
00:46:49.697 --> 00:46:51.686
The best time of your life.

419
00:46:53.007 --> 00:46:55.163
Yes, we're from Kleinenberg.

420
00:46:55.570 --> 00:46:56.765
But we're not on vacation.

421
00:46:57.011 --> 00:46:58.570
We're looking for someone.

422
00:46:59.931 --> 00:47:02.205
A young man about my age, my build.

423
00:47:03.170 --> 00:47:04.729
I was wondering if you
might have seen him.


424
00:47:05.129 --> 00:47:06.928
If he came in here, perhaps?

425
00:47:07.442 --> 00:47:08.880
No, sir.

426
00:47:09.859 --> 00:47:12.401
Well, he may have come in for
a drink and you not noticed?


427
00:47:12.650 --> 00:47:14.149
I said no, sir.

428
00:47:16.610 --> 00:47:18.610
It was just a question.

429
00:47:47.661 --> 00:47:50.133
I think you're hiding something.

430
00:47:54.561 --> 00:47:55.875
I think you're lying.

431
00:47:56.527 --> 00:47:58.667
Don't you accuse me of lying!

432
00:47:59.161 --> 00:48:02.436
I think he was here. Well?

433
00:48:02.558 --> 00:48:03.641
Get out!

434
00:48:03.798 --> 00:48:06.321
Not until I know
what's happened to him.


435
00:48:06.495 --> 00:48:07.244
Simon!

436
00:48:07.641 --> 00:48:08.640
Get out!

437
00:48:08.836 --> 00:48:10.159
And now!

438
00:48:10.994 --> 00:48:13.063
He went to the castle!

439
00:48:13.483 --> 00:48:14.983
The castle?

440
00:48:17.427 --> 00:48:19.115
What castle?

441
00:48:19.653 --> 00:48:22.155
- What castle?!
- Simon!


442
00:48:26.435 --> 00:48:29.993
Out! Both of you!
You're not wanted here!


443
00:48:30.190 --> 00:48:31.389
Well, at least let her stay!

444
00:48:31.452 --> 00:48:33.688
No, Simon! Not without you.

445
00:48:40.198 --> 00:48:42.235
Well, at least we know
where he went.


446
00:48:42.450 --> 00:48:43.799
A castle. What castle?

447
00:48:44.039 --> 00:48:45.437
We can ask.

448
00:48:45.652 --> 00:48:47.795
Think anyone would tell us anything
in this God-forsaken spot?


449
00:48:48.038 --> 00:48:49.107
<i>I'll tell you.</i>

450
00:48:49.919 --> 00:48:51.533
You follow the road down to the village

451
00:48:51.534 --> 00:48:55.033
and you take the mountain pass
as far as you can go.


452
00:49:07.229 --> 00:49:10.741
Look, Sarah...it's miles yet.

453
00:49:11.196 --> 00:49:13.125
I think we should find
somewhere for you to stay.


454
00:49:13.126 --> 00:49:14.777
I'll go to the castle alone.

455
00:49:14.778 --> 00:49:16.154
You must be exhausted.

456
00:49:16.156 --> 00:49:19.785
No, Simon. This is the
first real clue we've had.


457
00:49:19.809 --> 00:49:21.626
We'll follow it together.

458
00:49:22.274 --> 00:49:23.774
I'm not leaving you.

459
00:49:24.846 --> 00:49:27.071
Not forever, I hope.

460
00:49:35.113 --> 00:49:35.944
Not forever.

461
00:50:32.064 --> 00:50:33.735
You're beautiful.

462
00:50:38.825 --> 00:50:40.974
You're very beautiful.

463
00:51:10.161 --> 00:51:11.761
Wait here.

464
00:51:54.109 --> 00:51:55.570
Simon!

465
00:52:18.973 --> 00:52:20.169
I...

466
00:52:20.414 --> 00:52:21.163
Sarah...

467
00:52:21.589 --> 00:52:23.491
The young lady is ill.

468
00:52:30.358 --> 00:52:32.922
She's suffering from shock.

469
00:52:34.085 --> 00:52:36.011
There was a bat.

470
00:52:40.610 --> 00:52:42.988
We are sorry to intrude.

471
00:52:43.964 --> 00:52:45.720
Why have you come here?

472
00:52:45.834 --> 00:52:48.257
We're looking for someone - my brother.

473
00:52:48.258 --> 00:52:49.968
No one has been here.

474
00:52:50.079 --> 00:52:51.562
We were told...

475
00:52:51.954 --> 00:52:53.364
What were you told?

476
00:52:53.704 --> 00:52:54.598
They told us in the village...

477
00:52:54.848 --> 00:52:55.679
The village?

478
00:52:56.379 --> 00:52:59.287
It's not very likely, is it?
I mean, why should he come here?


479
00:52:59.312 --> 00:53:01.402
There's no reason.

480
00:53:02.622 --> 00:53:04.682
We have guests.

481
00:53:05.368 --> 00:53:08.917
- The room is prepared, sir.
- Bring blankets.


482
00:53:09.168 --> 00:53:10.521
You shall sleep here.

483
00:53:10.767 --> 00:53:13.685
I must apologize for the
inconvenience, but since the fire...


484
00:53:13.686 --> 00:53:15.237
Fire?

485
00:53:28.207 --> 00:53:29.833
Sarah!

486
00:53:40.603 --> 00:53:43.876
The young lady will be
quite comfortable.


487
00:54:36.727 --> 00:54:41.735
Who is he? Our host - your master?

488
00:54:42.285 --> 00:54:45.798
The last remaining member
of the Dracula family, sir.


489
00:54:45.922 --> 00:54:47.425
Dracula?

490
00:54:47.680 --> 00:54:50.315
One of the oldest families in this land.

491
00:54:50.557 --> 00:54:52.547
If not in the whole of Europe.

492
00:54:53.036 --> 00:54:55.393
He said there was a fire.

493
00:54:55.757 --> 00:54:57.475
Yes...a tragedy.

494
00:54:57.753 --> 00:54:58.864
An accident?

495
00:54:59.554 --> 00:55:03.024
No. No accident.
They did it...the villagers.


496
00:55:03.274 --> 00:55:04.673
They came up here one day.

497
00:55:05.315 --> 00:55:06.303
It was terrible.

498
00:55:06.699 --> 00:55:10.861
They tried to burn my master.
Burn him alive.


499
00:55:11.632 --> 00:55:13.132
But why?

500
00:55:15.926 --> 00:55:18.151
The young lady is asleep.

501
00:55:18.176 --> 00:55:19.860
A drink?

502
00:55:19.984 --> 00:55:21.700
Thank you.

503
00:55:36.566 --> 00:55:37.565
Excellent.

504
00:55:37.734 --> 00:55:39.466
Thank you.

505
00:56:47.834 --> 00:56:49.736
The Cross!

506
00:57:05.141 --> 00:57:10.990
It's her in the picture. Oh, no!

507
00:57:12.827 --> 00:57:14.658
The Cross!!

508
00:57:14.678 --> 00:57:16.403
No!!

509
00:57:26.803 --> 00:57:28.233
Sarah.

510
00:57:28.498 --> 00:57:30.009
Must find Sarah.

511
00:57:36.554 --> 00:57:38.227
(knock)

512
00:57:40.966 --> 00:57:42.167
Who is it?

513
00:57:42.202 --> 00:57:43.202
Me.

514
00:57:44.002 --> 00:57:45.583
Well, come in.

515
00:57:47.086 --> 00:57:48.568
It's locked.

516
00:57:49.043 --> 00:57:50.369
Oh, yes!

517
00:57:57.649 --> 00:57:59.572
You can come in. It's open.

518
00:58:07.724 --> 00:58:09.565
Feeling better?

519
00:58:10.430 --> 00:58:12.245
I don't know.

520
00:58:12.384 --> 00:58:14.445
I'm confused.

521
00:58:14.568 --> 00:58:17.279
I had a dream. 
It was horrible!

522
00:58:18.561 --> 00:58:21.008
Oh, I don't know, darling.

523
00:58:22.204 --> 00:58:23.803
What time is it?

524
00:58:24.182 --> 00:58:26.400
It's late. We both overslept.

525
00:58:27.233 --> 00:58:29.332
(footsteps)

526
00:58:45.091 --> 00:58:47.485
There's service for you.

527
00:58:51.942 --> 00:58:53.642
Hot broth.

528
00:58:53.679 --> 00:58:55.716
Drink it. It will do you good.

529
00:58:55.931 --> 00:58:57.763
I'll go find Klove and
ask him some questions.


530
00:58:57.808 --> 00:58:59.643
No, please don't leave me.

531
00:58:59.688 --> 00:59:01.917
I won't be long, I promise.

532
00:59:52.615 --> 00:59:53.922
(groan)

533
01:00:00.775 --> 01:00:02.235
Paul?

534
01:00:03.115 --> 01:00:05.311
Is that you, Paul?

535
01:00:24.633 --> 01:00:26.389
It's my picture!

536
01:00:30.908 --> 01:00:32.390
God Almighty!

537
01:00:32.715 --> 01:00:34.353
Who did that to you?

538
01:00:35.372 --> 01:00:37.114
You should get away from here.

539
01:00:40.732 --> 01:00:42.312
He'll do the same to you.

540
01:00:42.714 --> 01:00:43.714
Your master?

541
01:00:44.315 --> 01:00:46.065
Worse to her.

542
01:00:49.287 --> 01:00:51.464
Where did you get this?

543
01:00:52.594 --> 01:00:53.582
He was here, wasn't he?

544
01:00:53.833 --> 01:00:54.833
Paul was here!

545
01:00:55.163 --> 01:00:56.427
What happened to him?

546
01:00:56.466 --> 01:00:58.150
Tell me!

547
01:00:58.512 --> 01:00:59.865
I won't tell you anything.

548
01:01:01.414 --> 01:01:04.081
You will tell me everything!

549
01:01:04.685 --> 01:01:05.684
Tell me!!

550
01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:10.310
Alright! He was here
but he got away!


551
01:01:14.670 --> 01:01:16.944
You must get away, too! Now!

552
01:01:17.629 --> 01:01:18.979
Take her with you!

553
01:01:20.327 --> 01:01:22.780
He'll do terrible things
to her if you don't.


554
01:01:22.868 --> 01:01:24.259
Terrible things!

555
01:01:25.077 --> 01:01:26.184
Don't let him.

556
01:01:27.821 --> 01:01:30.344
I'll help you get away.

557
01:01:31.195 --> 01:01:33.866
- Wha... It may be too late!
- Why?


558
01:01:34.026 --> 01:01:35.304
The broth!!

559
01:01:49.591 --> 01:01:51.259
Have you drunk any yet?

560
01:01:51.586 --> 01:01:52.585
Tell me!!

561
01:01:52.865 --> 01:01:53.615
A little!

562
01:01:53.787 --> 01:01:55.014
We're getting out of here.

563
01:01:55.264 --> 01:01:57.096
Come on, quick. Quickly!

564
01:01:58.169 --> 01:02:01.020
My portrait. The one Paul gave me!

565
01:02:01.264 --> 01:02:02.412
Yes, Paul.

566
01:02:02.673 --> 01:02:04.674
He was here, but hurry!

567
01:03:25.135 --> 01:03:26.647
I need help.

568
01:03:30.529 --> 01:03:35.761
That young man...my brother...
is up there in the castle. I'm sure of it.


569
01:03:36.773 --> 01:03:37.968
I want you to come with me,

570
01:03:38.293 --> 01:03:40.043
help me find him, and bring him back.

571
01:03:40.292 --> 01:03:41.487
Are you mad?

572
01:03:41.729 --> 01:03:44.227
I beg you to help me!

573
01:03:48.508 --> 01:03:50.359
Did none of you hear me?!

574
01:03:50.451 --> 01:03:54.531
- A man's life is in danger!
- Nothing to do with us.


575
01:03:56.186 --> 01:03:57.566
Then I'll go alone.

576
01:03:57.917 --> 01:03:59.416
Simon, you can't!

577
01:04:00.610 --> 01:04:04.041
At least let her stay. I can't
take her back up there again.


578
01:04:04.078 --> 01:04:08.078
Go back where you came from!
We want no trouble here!


579
01:04:08.420 --> 01:04:10.921
(horses departing)

580
01:04:18.394 --> 01:04:19.918
In God's name!

581
01:04:22.732 --> 01:04:25.197
The Devil's, more like.

582
01:04:25.596 --> 01:04:27.898
Take her with you!

583
01:04:37.109 --> 01:04:38.600
Cowards!

584
01:04:42.674 --> 01:04:44.273
We must find somewhere for you to stay.

585
01:04:44.274 --> 01:04:46.875
But you can't go back there alone!

586
01:04:50.657 --> 01:04:52.683
Come with me.

587
01:05:12.292 --> 01:05:13.996
A church!

588
01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:15.715
Thank God.

589
01:05:16.140 --> 01:05:17.110
Not anymore.

590
01:05:18.190 --> 01:05:20.678
It was once vilely used.

591
01:05:20.922 --> 01:05:23.480
The villagers refuse to
come here any longer.


592
01:05:24.708 --> 01:05:26.354
Father, you will look after her?

593
01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:28.670
I'm going to look after you both.

594
01:05:28.964 --> 01:05:30.479
I must go back. 
I'm sure Paul's there!

595
01:05:30.670 --> 01:05:33.552
You must do nothing at the moment
but stay here until dawn!


596
01:05:33.675 --> 01:05:35.075
No, I can't wait.

597
01:05:35.319 --> 01:05:36.877
I will explain:

598
01:05:37.175 --> 01:05:40.512
You must give me time to prepare
you for what we both have to do.


599
01:05:40.735 --> 01:05:41.835
Both?

600
01:05:42.118 --> 01:05:44.074
Yes, both of us.

601
01:05:44.343 --> 01:05:47.312
Without my guidance, you'd
never survive the ordeal.


602
01:05:47.365 --> 01:05:50.264
Without your courage,
I could not even attempt it.


603
01:05:50.699 --> 01:05:54.699
Now, there is nothing either
of us can do until daybreak.


604
01:06:06.100 --> 01:06:07.949
What are you doing?

605
01:06:08.194 --> 01:06:09.714
I'm going, and don't try to stop me.

606
01:06:09.719 --> 01:06:11.259
I can't stand it here any longer.

607
01:06:11.795 --> 01:06:13.591
- You can't go now!
- Why not?


608
01:06:13.735 --> 01:06:16.469
You've heard what's going on here.
You've seen it!


609
01:06:16.835 --> 01:06:19.985
I've heard a lot of superstitious
rubbish, but I've seen nothing!


610
01:06:20.005 --> 01:06:23.430
My village isn't like this. I'm going
before I end up like you!


611
01:06:23.432 --> 01:06:24.469
Julie!

612
01:06:24.536 --> 01:06:28.032
There's...something I've never told you.

613
01:06:28.834 --> 01:06:31.347
Something I must tell you now.

614
01:06:31.884 --> 01:06:32.908
My Maria...

615
01:06:33.294 --> 01:06:35.982
- You know how she died?
- Well, you said...


616
01:06:36.930 --> 01:06:41.108
I lied to you. I wanted you
to stay, so I lied.


617
01:06:41.374 --> 01:06:42.875
Well, how did she die?

618
01:06:43.126 --> 01:06:44.101
She was murdered.

619
01:06:44.206 --> 01:06:47.894
Murdered? How? Who did it?

620
01:06:47.895 --> 01:06:52.115
Him. He did it. 
He killed her.

621
01:06:52.722 --> 01:06:55.116
Who? You saw him?

622
01:06:56.719 --> 01:06:58.250
Well then, how do you know?

623
01:06:58.323 --> 01:06:59.992
The bats.

624
01:07:00.227 --> 01:07:02.859
He has power over animals.
You don't understand!


625
01:07:03.219 --> 01:07:07.673
No, and I don't want to.
I'm leaving before it gets too late.


626
01:07:15.523 --> 01:07:17.584
You let them go!!

627
01:07:17.808 --> 01:07:20.503
I have sinned, master.

628
01:07:56.990 --> 01:07:59.618
The man had been savagely beaten.

629
01:07:59.779 --> 01:08:01.419
His back was...

630
01:08:02.419 --> 01:08:05.659
Well...he said his master
was a monster.


631
01:08:05.900 --> 01:08:07.094
He was right.

632
01:08:07.341 --> 01:08:08.615
Yes, I can believe him.

633
01:08:09.149 --> 01:08:11.166
Anyway, he helped us escape.

634
01:08:11.167 --> 01:08:12.887
For that you should be grateful.

635
01:08:12.988 --> 01:08:14.095
Was he telling the truth?

636
01:08:14.137 --> 01:08:16.330
Yes, he was telling the truth.

637
01:08:16.582 --> 01:08:18.331
But only part of it.

638
01:08:18.660 --> 01:08:21.889
His master is indeed,
as he rightly said, a monster.


639
01:08:22.178 --> 01:08:23.736
He is also a vampire.

640
01:08:24.758 --> 01:08:26.732
A vampire?

641
01:08:27.484 --> 01:08:28.978
A vampire is a bat.

642
01:08:29.937 --> 01:08:30.815
A bat!

643
01:08:31.072 --> 01:08:33.429
He has dominion over some animals.

644
01:08:33.430 --> 01:08:36.368
And bats, being creatures
of the dark, like himself...


645
01:08:36.618 --> 01:08:38.971
Don't vampire bats...drink blood?

646
01:08:38.995 --> 01:08:40.447
They do.

647
01:08:41.021 --> 01:08:43.172
Vampire bats drink the blood of animals.

648
01:08:43.915 --> 01:08:45.766
And human vampires?

649
01:08:46.085 --> 01:08:47.894
The blood of human beings.

650
01:08:48.176 --> 01:08:49.451
Oh, my God!

651
01:08:49.701 --> 01:08:53.322
Now you are beginning to realize
what we shall be facing.


652
01:08:53.445 --> 01:08:54.933
My dream...

653
01:08:54.934 --> 01:08:56.685
What dream?

654
01:08:58.175 --> 01:09:00.814
I dreamed he came to my room.

655
01:09:01.458 --> 01:09:03.771
He bent over me.

656
01:09:03.961 --> 01:09:06.808
I could feel his breath on my neck.

657
01:09:08.413 --> 01:09:09.912
And then...

658
01:09:10.312 --> 01:09:13.051
Ah! The crucifix!

659
01:09:14.974 --> 01:09:16.217
Did that save her?

660
01:09:16.218 --> 01:09:17.721
Without a doubt.

661
01:09:17.972 --> 01:09:20.440
It is one of
the things he fears most.

662
01:09:20.692 --> 01:09:22.683
The symbol of our Savior.

663
01:09:34.050 --> 01:09:35.344
Now, wear this.

664
01:09:35.345 --> 01:09:37.880
Don't let it leave your person
even for an instant!


665
01:09:37.942 --> 01:09:39.483
Do you understand?

666
01:09:40.504 --> 01:09:44.247
What we shall be facing
in a few hours time is not a man.


667
01:09:44.629 --> 01:09:45.843
He is evil.

668
01:09:46.219 --> 01:09:49.527
He is the embodiment
of all that is evil.

669
01:09:49.814 --> 01:09:52.359
He is the very Devil himself.

670
01:10:45.441 --> 01:10:48.375
I have work for you.

671
01:10:53.331 --> 01:10:56.033
(bird call)

672
01:12:11.976 --> 01:12:15.028
Hyah! Gidup!

673
01:12:20.829 --> 01:12:22.572
Stop!

674
01:12:40.154 --> 01:12:41.956
Whoa!

675
01:12:49.058 --> 01:12:51.032
No! let me go!

676
01:12:53.947 --> 01:12:55.899
Have I pleased you, master?

677
01:12:56.237 --> 01:12:58.005
Am I forgiven?

678
01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:01.738
You have done well.

679
01:14:10.825 --> 01:14:12.670
We've a long way to go, Father.

680
01:14:12.672 --> 01:14:15.357
Hadn't we better hurry?

681
01:14:15.829 --> 01:14:19.833
Yes, you're right, my son. Come.

682
01:14:46.121 --> 01:14:48.683
The Bat! The Bat!

683
01:14:52.746 --> 01:14:56.445
Father, you have told me what
I have to do, and I'm grateful.


684
01:14:57.053 --> 01:14:59.562
Do one more thing for me.

685
01:14:59.566 --> 01:15:03.486
Go back to Sarah. Watch her
as if she were your own child.


686
01:15:03.506 --> 01:15:05.325
Do this for me!

687
01:15:05.482 --> 01:15:07.185
See that no harm comes to her.

688
01:15:07.459 --> 01:15:09.904
Do this one thing for me.

689
01:15:10.285 --> 01:15:12.438
I've failed you.

690
01:15:12.731 --> 01:15:15.005
- No.
- Yes, yes. Failed.


691
01:15:15.174 --> 01:15:19.289
I can look after myself. Sarah can't.

692
01:15:19.639 --> 01:15:23.288
You will only have failed
if any harm comes to her.


693
01:15:24.252 --> 01:15:26.910
Yes. Yes.

694
01:15:27.446 --> 01:15:28.764
Thank you, Father.

695
01:15:29.285 --> 01:15:31.993
God be with you, my son.

696
01:16:15.271 --> 01:16:18.623
Klove?! Open up!

697
01:16:24.482 --> 01:16:26.935
You can help me.

698
01:16:27.081 --> 01:16:28.620
Go away.

699
01:16:28.638 --> 01:16:30.752
Sarah's with me.

700
01:16:31.090 --> 01:16:32.354
You haven't brought her back?!

701
01:16:32.427 --> 01:16:35.302
Yes. Now, open up!

702
01:16:39.745 --> 01:16:41.627
I don't want to hurt you.

703
01:16:41.628 --> 01:16:44.475
You think you can hurt me?

704
01:16:44.860 --> 01:16:46.987
What happened to my brother?

705
01:16:47.327 --> 01:16:49.094
The young man who was here.

706
01:16:49.352 --> 01:16:50.852
- Give me!
- Tell me!


707
01:16:51.041 --> 01:16:55.096
I told you...He climbed out of the window.

708
01:16:55.105 --> 01:16:59.638
I found the bed curtains knotted
together and hanging out of the window.


709
01:17:00.294 --> 01:17:01.929
Show me.

710
01:17:02.768 --> 01:17:06.268
Show me and you shall have it.

711
01:17:23.163 --> 01:17:25.386
He couldn't have climbed
all the way down there.


712
01:17:25.862 --> 01:17:27.184
Where did he go?

713
01:17:27.185 --> 01:17:29.232
That window...

714
01:17:29.474 --> 01:17:30.682
That's where he is.

715
01:17:31.093 --> 01:17:33.596
That's where the master sleeps.

716
01:17:33.906 --> 01:17:36.665
- There must be another way in.
- No.


717
01:17:36.915 --> 01:17:38.839
That's the master's
protection, you see,


718
01:17:38.840 --> 01:17:43.596
while he's sleeping.
There is no other way.


719
01:17:45.143 --> 01:17:46.986
A rope.

720
01:17:47.260 --> 01:17:49.758
I shall need a rope.

721
01:18:41.048 --> 01:18:44.756
The portrait! Give me the portrait!

722
01:21:37.943 --> 01:21:40.442
Run!! Run!!

723
01:23:39.678 --> 01:23:42.881
You have decided to
return to my house.


724
01:23:43.876 --> 01:23:45.059
You are alone?

725
01:23:45.518 --> 01:23:48.137
Yes, thanks be to God.

726
01:23:49.748 --> 01:23:50.945
Where is she?

727
01:23:51.215 --> 01:23:53.088
She is safe.

728
01:23:54.540 --> 01:23:55.946
(bat cries)

729
01:24:04.317 --> 01:24:06.317
I think not.

730
01:24:48.425 --> 01:24:49.970
Simon?!

731
01:24:54.256 --> 01:24:55.935
Klove?!

732
01:24:56.476 --> 01:24:57.476
(thunder)

733
01:25:51.902 --> 01:25:54.130
No, don't be frightened.

734
01:25:55.144 --> 01:25:56.993
Don't be frightened.

735
01:25:57.343 --> 01:25:59.611
I'm not going to hurt you.

736
01:26:01.898 --> 01:26:04.285
I want to help you.

737
01:26:30.054 --> 01:26:31.054
The Cross!

738
01:27:06.111 --> 01:27:07.840
Simon!

739
01:27:37.123 --> 01:27:38.514
No!

740
01:28:23.725 --> 01:28:25.292
Count!

741
01:28:27.448 --> 01:28:29.328
Count!!
