4
00:02:28.685 --> 00:02:31.143
Clóvis!

5
00:02:31.851 --> 00:02:34.226
Have you talked to your dad's girlfriend?

6
00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.226
Aren't you Dad's girlfriend?

7
00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.685
Dad's girlfriend is Aunt Jussara.

8
00:02:38.768 --> 00:02:40.018
Pay attention.

9
00:02:40.518 --> 00:02:42.726
Mom and Dad are no longer together.

10
00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.226
You will live with them.

11
00:02:44.726 --> 00:02:47.143
Aunt Jussara is rich! Very rich!

12
00:02:47.226 --> 00:02:48.893
It's for the best, dear.

13
00:02:49.435 --> 00:02:51.851
Mommy is not leaving you, though.

14
00:02:52.518 --> 00:02:56.060
I just want you to have everything.
You'll see.


15
00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.185
<i>I never understood her.</i>

16
00:03:02.268 --> 00:03:04.643
<i>And I understand family issues.</i>

17
00:03:04.726 --> 00:03:06.018
<i>I had several.</i>

18
00:03:06.976 --> 00:03:09.768
<i>My mom left me
with Dad and Aunt Jussara.</i>

19
00:03:10.601 --> 00:03:13.476
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

20
00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.726
Make a wish!

21
00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.435
<i>Then, my dad took off</i>
<i>and left me with her.</i>


22
00:03:18.851 --> 00:03:20.810
-Blow it out!
<i>-She married Dirceu.</i>


23
00:03:20.893 --> 00:03:22.143
Make a wish, come on.

24
00:03:22.893 --> 00:03:24.226
Hurry up, Clóvis.

25
00:03:26.726 --> 00:03:27.560
Yay!

26
00:03:27.643 --> 00:03:29.393
<i>Then Aunt Jussara also left me.</i>

27
00:03:29.476 --> 00:03:31.726
-Blow it!
<i>-Dirceu married Soninha.</i>


28
00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.435
Make a wish, quick.

29
00:03:34.143 --> 00:03:35.060
Hurry up, boy.

30
00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.101
-Great.
<i>-Then Soninha left him.</i>


31
00:03:38.976 --> 00:03:41.810
<i>By then, I was living</i>
<i>with Soninha and Rubens.</i>


32
00:03:41.893 --> 00:03:44.435
Let's sing "Happy Birthday" to him!
Come quick!


33
00:03:44.518 --> 00:03:46.185
-Lohane!
-<i>Lohane's father.</i>


34
00:03:48.685 --> 00:03:49.810
I want a picture!

35
00:03:50.351 --> 00:03:52.768
No, Clóvis! Stay. 
You're family!

36
00:03:52.851 --> 00:03:55.560
<i>That's Lohane, Rubens' daughter,</i>
<i>my stepsister.</i>


37
00:03:55.643 --> 00:03:57.685
<i>We got along quite well.</i>

38
00:03:57.768 --> 00:03:59.476
<i>My longest stay was there.</i>

39
00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.935
<i>We grew up together. 
I really liked her.</i>

40
00:04:05.226 --> 00:04:06.435
<i>As time went by,</i>

41
00:04:06.518 --> 00:04:09.601
<i>I left as soon as I could</i>
<i>to live on my own.</i>


42
00:04:09.685 --> 00:04:10.768
15 YEARS LATER

43
00:04:12.893 --> 00:04:13.893
<i>But doing what?</i>

44
00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.518
<i>I could paint well.</i>

45
00:04:19.143 --> 00:04:21.685
<i>As time passed, 
I got really good.</i>

46
00:04:21.768 --> 00:04:24.643
<i>I was able to
paint actual works of art.</i>

47
00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.685
<i>I mean, works of art that were actually…</i>

48
00:04:29.768 --> 00:04:30.893
<i>fake.</i>

49
00:04:33.476 --> 00:04:37.018
<i>Then I met a big shot</i>
<i>who buys this kind of stuff.</i>


50
00:04:37.726 --> 00:04:39.185
This is great!

51
00:04:39.268 --> 00:04:43.101
It's a piece by an artist known worldwide!

52
00:04:43.185 --> 00:04:46.893
Everyone in Paris, Milan,
and New York knows who he is.


53
00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.976
I'll pay half the price.

54
00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.726
What? We already agreed on the value!

55
00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:52.643
You know that!

56
00:04:53.393 --> 00:04:54.810
I'll pay half the price.

57
00:04:55.601 --> 00:04:56.560
No deal.

58
00:04:56.643 --> 00:04:59.268
Come with Daddy, son. 
Art doesn't pay.

59
00:04:59.351 --> 00:05:01.268
Fortunato, what's going on here?

60
00:05:01.351 --> 00:05:03.351
-It's the auction deal.
-Deal?


61
00:05:03.435 --> 00:05:05.893
He wants to pay half the agreed price.

62
00:05:05.976 --> 00:05:07.560
Should I destroy the piece

63
00:05:07.643 --> 00:05:09.101
and sell him half of it?

64
00:05:09.685 --> 00:05:10.518
Fortunato,

65
00:05:11.268 --> 00:05:12.518
pay him the right amount.

66
00:05:13.893 --> 00:05:15.893
Thank you, Senator.

67
00:05:15.976 --> 00:05:18.476
Thank you so much. 
You are a good man.

68
00:05:19.101 --> 00:05:21.726
If you need anything, just ask me.

69
00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:23.226
That Portinari piece?

70
00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:25.810
Auctioned off
for five times its original price.


71
00:05:25.893 --> 00:05:27.560
Great. Talk to Fortunato.

72
00:05:27.643 --> 00:05:30.601
<i>I sold him a
painting for a good price.</i>

73
00:05:31.101 --> 00:05:31.935
Look.

74
00:05:33.018 --> 00:05:35.935
Daddy loves you,
but it's for the best, okay?


75
00:05:37.476 --> 00:05:40.476
Thank you, Senator. 
You're very generous.

76
00:05:41.685 --> 00:05:42.685
See you soon.

77
00:05:54.101 --> 00:05:55.893
<i>My day was just beginning.</i>

78
00:05:55.976 --> 00:05:58.435
<i>A con artist never performs only once.</i>

79
00:06:02.185 --> 00:06:03.143
Help!

80
00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:04.893
Help!

81
00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:07.351
-Help!
-What's the matter?


82
00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:10.685
Can anyone just come in here?

83
00:06:11.643 --> 00:06:13.810
Is there someone bothering you?

84
00:06:13.893 --> 00:06:17.018
The fly that just got in here
and in my hot chocolate.


85
00:06:17.101 --> 00:06:18.476
I almost swallowed it.

86
00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:19.976
Luckily, I spit it out.

87
00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:21.560
I'll handle it.

88
00:06:21.643 --> 00:06:22.518
Please.

89
00:06:23.643 --> 00:06:25.476
-We have a problem.
-What is it?


90
00:06:26.101 --> 00:06:28.560
It seems a fly fell in his drink.

91
00:06:28.643 --> 00:06:30.101
Excuse me.

92
00:06:30.185 --> 00:06:32.560
-Let's avoid further embarrassment.
-Yes.


93
00:06:32.643 --> 00:06:34.935
The hot chocolate is on the house.

94
00:06:35.018 --> 00:06:36.310
The hot chocolate?

95
00:06:38.351 --> 00:06:41.393
Just the hot chocolate
is on the house. Funny!


96
00:06:41.476 --> 00:06:43.018
What about the rest?

97
00:06:43.101 --> 00:06:46.185
The rest is the whole menu.
You ate it all.


98
00:06:46.268 --> 00:06:47.351
Even a fly!

99
00:06:47.435 --> 00:06:50.101
Ladies and gentlemen, a minute, please.

100
00:06:50.185 --> 00:06:51.310
Pay attention.

101
00:06:51.393 --> 00:06:53.018
Pay attention, silly girl.

102
00:06:53.101 --> 00:06:56.101
I'm sorry for disturbing your breakfast,

103
00:06:56.185 --> 00:06:59.851
but, unfortunately,
we're served flies in Brazil.


104
00:06:59.935 --> 00:07:04.143
You can't leave without paying
after eating everything on the menu.


105
00:07:04.226 --> 00:07:08.143
I will pay for it. That's not the point.
It will cost you a lot.


106
00:07:08.226 --> 00:07:11.185
I'll pay.
I don't need charity or anything.


107
00:07:11.268 --> 00:07:15.393
-I want justice.
-Clean it up, please.


108
00:07:15.476 --> 00:07:19.185
Don't touch the crime scene! All right?

109
00:07:19.268 --> 00:07:22.018
I want a forensic examination. I'll do it.

110
00:07:26.101 --> 00:07:29.560
Guys, I just can't. 
It's sad, you know?

111
00:07:29.643 --> 00:07:33.518
It died on such a beautiful morning.
Did you see that?


112
00:07:34.101 --> 00:07:35.560
It used to fly so freely.

113
00:07:35.643 --> 00:07:38.185
What a sudden and unnecessary death!

114
00:07:39.393 --> 00:07:43.185
I killed it, lady!
I killed it. I'm devastated!


115
00:07:44.393 --> 00:07:45.560
Poor thing!

116
00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.268
Forgive me, Buddha!

117
00:07:48.351 --> 00:07:51.476
All right, no harm done.
No need to pay for anything.


118
00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:53.226
It's on the house, okay?

119
00:07:54.185 --> 00:07:55.351
You can leave now.

120
00:07:55.435 --> 00:07:59.060
That's great.
Let's avoid further embarrassment.


121
00:07:59.143 --> 00:08:00.685
-Sure.
-I'll forgive you.


122
00:08:03.518 --> 00:08:04.810
<i>I'm not ashamed.</i>

123
00:08:04.893 --> 00:08:07.310
<i>People screw us over all the time.</i>

124
00:08:07.393 --> 00:08:09.893
<i>Why should I pay a
lot of money to eat?</i>

125
00:08:14.351 --> 00:08:17.226
<i>One scam after another has led me here,</i>

126
00:08:17.726 --> 00:08:20.226
<i>to the most important day of my life.</i>

127
00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:25.935
Listen, this is the last time
I'm helping you with your scams. I'm done.


128
00:08:26.435 --> 00:08:27.435
Great.

129
00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:31.143
Today is my last day. I'm done with you.

130
00:08:31.226 --> 00:08:32.685
You always say that.

131
00:08:32.768 --> 00:08:35.310
Then, a week later,
you ask me for a favor.


132
00:08:35.393 --> 00:08:36.518
I know you, Clóvis.

133
00:08:36.601 --> 00:08:38.393
I sold Christ, man.

134
00:08:39.101 --> 00:08:40.060
What?

135
00:08:40.143 --> 00:08:41.768
<i>Christ the Redeemer.</i>

136
00:08:41.851 --> 00:08:42.935
You're lying!

137
00:08:43.018 --> 00:08:45.726
Who's going to buy that statue?

138
00:08:46.268 --> 00:08:49.976
A crook, someone who wants
to benefit from the crisis.


139
00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:54.435
I did Brazil a favor by taking money
from a corrupt businessman.


140
00:08:54.518 --> 00:08:56.268
Come on, Robin Hood.

141
00:08:56.351 --> 00:08:59.435
I'll say more.
You don't have the guts to do that.


142
00:08:59.518 --> 00:09:01.893
I'll show you. 
I have the documents.

143
00:09:02.393 --> 00:09:04.685
I dare you to say this is fake.

144
00:09:05.268 --> 00:09:08.976
I even created a website
with a code so they can check it.


145
00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:10.685
It's all there.

146
00:09:10.768 --> 00:09:12.310
Have you no shame?

147
00:09:12.393 --> 00:09:13.643
No, none at all.

148
00:09:14.143 --> 00:09:18.226
I told them it is confidential
under the state secrecy law.


149
00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:22.185
I said the government
won't disclose it yet to avoid protests,


150
00:09:22.268 --> 00:09:25.560
and the press is being paid, but will
denounce it later to play innocent.


151
00:09:25.643 --> 00:09:29.060
I asked for a bribe
for the mayor, for myself,


152
00:09:29.143 --> 00:09:31.393
for the governor and for myself again,

153
00:09:31.476 --> 00:09:33.560
so I can set
him up with the deal.

154
00:09:33.643 --> 00:09:35.560
-Did they buy it?
-Of course.


155
00:09:35.643 --> 00:09:38.435
You can't trust a deal without bribery.

156
00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:40.810
<i>A hundred years ago in Paris,</i>

157
00:09:40.893 --> 00:09:46.393
<i>a man tried to sell the Eiffel Tower</i>
<i>to one of the biggest scrap metal dealers.</i>


158
00:09:46.476 --> 00:09:47.935
<i>He was so successful</i>

159
00:09:48.018 --> 00:09:50.976
<i>that he went back to France</i>
<i>and sold it again.</i>


160
00:09:51.476 --> 00:09:54.268
<i>We are used to copying things from abroad.</i>

161
00:09:54.351 --> 00:09:57.726
<i>The Christ statue</i>
<i>was left unattended, so I sold it.</i>


162
00:09:58.226 --> 00:09:59.060
<i>I did.</i>

163
00:09:59.143 --> 00:10:00.060
SOLD

164
00:10:00.143 --> 00:10:04.143
<i>All I needed was</i>
<i>a corrupt man willing to make a deal.</i>


165
00:10:04.226 --> 00:10:06.185
<i>And there are many like</i> <i>him here.</i>

166
00:10:06.268 --> 00:10:07.393
Where is the money?

167
00:10:08.018 --> 00:10:12.060
-Now? In broad daylight?
-Don't worry. It's all good.


168
00:10:12.143 --> 00:10:16.018
People don't hide things anymore.
The more explicit, the better.


169
00:10:16.101 --> 00:10:17.685
Everything is for sale.

170
00:10:17.768 --> 00:10:20.518
The Amazon is no longer ours.

171
00:10:20.601 --> 00:10:23.101
Not even a cricket
speaks Portuguese there.


172
00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:25.685
Where is the money?

173
00:10:28.435 --> 00:10:30.101
Why are you hiding it?

174
00:10:30.185 --> 00:10:32.268
Give me that. Don't be suspicious.

175
00:10:32.351 --> 00:10:36.435
I loved this vase.
I'll take it. Don't mind me. Bye.


176
00:10:36.518 --> 00:10:39.185
<i>I have the solution for our people</i>

177
00:10:39.935 --> 00:10:42.726
<i>A good business like this</i>
<i>No one's ever seen</i>


178
00:10:43.226 --> 00:10:46.435
<i>Everything is ready</i>
<i>Just come and take it</i>


179
00:10:46.518 --> 00:10:50.018
<i>The solution is putting Brazil up for rent</i>

180
00:10:50.101 --> 00:10:52.310
<i>We won't pay for anything</i>…

181
00:10:53.351 --> 00:10:55.851
<i>This country is a joke.</i>
<i>Why should I be serious?</i>


182
00:10:56.768 --> 00:10:58.810
<i>Come on, it was a good scam.</i>

183
00:11:03.726 --> 00:11:07.351
-You pulled it off!
-Yes! Thanks for the recognition.


184
00:11:07.435 --> 00:11:11.268
<i>Not to brag, but I totally rocked it.</i>

185
00:11:11.768 --> 00:11:14.435
<i>The foreigners will love it</i>

186
00:11:15.018 --> 00:11:17.310
<i>It's got the Atlantic and a sea view</i>…

187
00:11:17.893 --> 00:11:20.851
<i>After everything I went through,</i>
<i>all the trouble,</i>


188
00:11:20.935 --> 00:11:22.976
<i>I worked so hard,</i>

189
00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:25.685
<i>and I was living</i>
<i>the best moment of my life.</i>


190
00:11:25.768 --> 00:11:27.560
<i>We won't pay for anything</i>

191
00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:30.351
<i>We won't pay for anything</i>

192
00:11:31.226 --> 00:11:32.143
<i>It's all free</i>

193
00:11:32.226 --> 00:11:34.018
<i>It's time</i>

194
00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:40.518
<i>But since poor people</i>
<i>can't be happy for long,</i>


195
00:11:40.601 --> 00:11:42.185
<i>everything changed.</i>

196
00:11:44.768 --> 00:11:45.643
Clóvis.

197
00:11:46.435 --> 00:11:47.351
Is your TV on?

198
00:11:47.935 --> 00:11:48.810
Probably not.

199
00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:51.226
Turn on the news. 
We're screwed.

200
00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:53.018
It was at this cafe

201
00:11:53.101 --> 00:11:56.643
that the businessmen allegedly met a man

202
00:11:56.726 --> 00:11:58.893
who sold them Rio's <i>Christ the Redeemer</i>

203
00:11:59.601 --> 00:12:01.935
<i>under the false name of Lívio Romero.</i>

204
00:12:02.018 --> 00:12:04.851
<i>As you can see,</i>
<i>this is the sketch of the suspect.</i>


205
00:12:04.935 --> 00:12:09.143
For fuck's sake, man!

206
00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:12.601
Hey, big guy! I need my car!

207
00:12:13.226 --> 00:12:16.851
<i>I'm sorry, Tavinho, but I need that car.</i>

208
00:12:26.976 --> 00:12:29.935
-Clóvis!
-I paid for it! You are my accomplice!


209
00:12:30.018 --> 00:12:32.935
-What? Come on, Clóvis!
-Accomplice! That's right!


210
00:12:33.018 --> 00:12:35.518
<i>Now I'll get my money
and get out of here.</i>

211
00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:48.810
<i>However, the Senator</i>
<i>was faster than me and the cops.</i>


212
00:12:49.643 --> 00:12:52.101
<i>It's my fault for messing with them.</i>

213
00:12:52.601 --> 00:12:56.435
JUST GO AND BE HAPPY, SON
ART DOESN'T PAY


214
00:13:02.726 --> 00:13:04.518
<i>That man got back at me.</i>

215
00:13:06.018 --> 00:13:08.935
<i>He broke into my house</i>
<i>and took all my money.</i>


216
00:13:11.476 --> 00:13:14.518
<i>I needed to run away
as fast as I could.</i>

217
00:13:20.685 --> 00:13:25.060
For fuck's sake! Did I kill you?

218
00:13:25.143 --> 00:13:27.476
Sorry, I can't help you right now.

219
00:13:29.518 --> 00:13:31.935
Lohane? Did you have to show up now?

220
00:13:32.018 --> 00:13:35.185
<i>You think he had a bad day? 
Imagine mine!</i>

221
00:13:35.268 --> 00:13:38.685
I serve the best breakfast of Magé.
Lohane's Point.


222
00:13:45.393 --> 00:13:48.060
BUY ONE BURGER AND
GET A GLASS OF JUICE

223
00:13:50.601 --> 00:13:53.143
Burger coming right up!

224
00:13:54.226 --> 00:13:57.101
I also gave you 800 napkins.

225
00:13:57.185 --> 00:13:59.643
They're so cheap,

226
00:13:59.726 --> 00:14:01.935
I can't afford the expensive ones,

227
00:14:02.018 --> 00:14:03.810
but I promise I'll buy them.

228
00:14:03.893 --> 00:14:06.768
-We have a delicious juice for free.
-Awesome!


229
00:14:06.851 --> 00:14:10.643
Artificial cashew fruit flavor
never found in nature.


230
00:14:11.643 --> 00:14:13.976
But it might be pineapple.

231
00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:16.143
It's delicious. So sweet!

232
00:14:19.893 --> 00:14:23.101
Keep laughing.
I'm working like a dog to survive.


233
00:14:23.185 --> 00:14:26.518
I work from Monday to Sunday.

234
00:14:26.601 --> 00:14:29.810
If I ever close this trailer,
it will be the end of me.


235
00:14:29.893 --> 00:14:31.393
The suffering never ends.

236
00:14:34.643 --> 00:14:35.893
It's hard, you know?

237
00:14:36.935 --> 00:14:37.768
What is?

238
00:14:38.351 --> 00:14:39.310
Life.

239
00:14:39.976 --> 00:14:41.976
Magé should be studied.

240
00:14:42.726 --> 00:14:43.976
What a hot place!

241
00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:45.476
NASA should study it,

242
00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:49.476
because I think
the sun is closer to here, for sure.


243
00:14:50.268 --> 00:14:52.518
I could fry a burger on the street.

244
00:14:52.601 --> 00:14:54.726
I don't do it. 
I have ethics.

245
00:14:56.518 --> 00:14:59.226
<i>But ethics is a complicated subject.</i>

246
00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:02.060
-Good afternoon. All good here?
-Hi!


247
00:15:02.685 --> 00:15:04.435
Distinguished customers.

248
00:15:04.518 --> 00:15:08.476
I have Cheese-Lohane, Lohane-salad,
Chicken-Lohane and Lohane Light.


249
00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:10.310
I hope you speak English.

250
00:15:10.976 --> 00:15:14.601
-What are you having?
-The trailer's business license.


251
00:15:16.685 --> 00:15:19.060
Well, this one…

252
00:15:19.143 --> 00:15:21.518
It's not on the menu. 
We're short on it.

253
00:15:22.101 --> 00:15:26.143
You can't sell food without it.
I have to confiscate the trailer.


254
00:15:26.226 --> 00:15:27.060
No, sir.

255
00:15:27.601 --> 00:15:31.018
Please, don't. That's my business.

256
00:15:31.101 --> 00:15:32.935
You'll destroy my life.

257
00:15:33.018 --> 00:15:34.726
Please, help me out!

258
00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:38.560
Maybe, with some incentive…

259
00:15:39.268 --> 00:15:40.101
Get it?

260
00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:44.476
-A sweetener?
-Yes.


261
00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:45.851
A kickback, you know?

262
00:15:45.935 --> 00:15:48.143
To help me feed my children.

263
00:15:48.685 --> 00:15:49.518
I know.

264
00:15:50.018 --> 00:15:51.560
It's not sweet at all.

265
00:15:54.143 --> 00:15:55.810
Here. That's all I have.

266
00:15:59.393 --> 00:16:03.768
Well, it's not enough for me
and my friend Pantoja over there.


267
00:16:05.185 --> 00:16:06.310
So?

268
00:16:06.393 --> 00:16:07.935
I will…

269
00:16:08.893 --> 00:16:09.976
I'll look for more.

270
00:16:18.768 --> 00:16:20.060
This month's income.

271
00:16:20.643 --> 00:16:22.101
Now we're talking.

272
00:16:22.185 --> 00:16:23.268
Very sweet.

273
00:16:23.893 --> 00:16:24.935
Have a nice day.

274
00:16:25.643 --> 00:16:27.060
Let's go, Pantoja.

275
00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:29.393
What was that?

276
00:16:29.935 --> 00:16:31.393
<i>What a situation!</i>

277
00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:36.768
<i>I need a license, but it costs money,</i>
<i>so I need to work for it.</i>


278
00:16:36.851 --> 00:16:37.935
<i>It's crazy!</i>

279
00:16:38.476 --> 00:16:41.143
<i>I paid them, but
I didn't lose my trailer.</i>

280
00:16:42.435 --> 00:16:44.518
<i>But poor people can't be happy for long,</i>

281
00:16:44.601 --> 00:16:46.101
<i>so everything changed.</i>

282
00:16:46.185 --> 00:16:48.810
Don't do that! 
I'm begging you!

283
00:16:48.893 --> 00:16:50.351
This trailer is my life!

284
00:16:50.435 --> 00:16:52.893
-Don't take it away!
-Calm down, ma'am.


285
00:16:52.976 --> 00:16:56.518
You're not allowed to sell food here,
we have to take it away.


286
00:16:56.601 --> 00:16:58.518
Yes! I mean, no!

287
00:16:58.601 --> 00:17:00.143
Is it a yes or a no?

288
00:17:00.226 --> 00:17:04.476
Yes, I don't have a license,
but you can't take my trailer away.


289
00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:07.976
I already sorted it out
with your friend who came by.


290
00:17:09.268 --> 00:17:10.101
-Friend?
-Yes!


291
00:17:10.185 --> 00:17:13.226
-I have no friends. What about you?
-No friends.


292
00:17:21.476 --> 00:17:23.018
Fake inspectors?

293
00:17:23.101 --> 00:17:25.601
Yes, there are a lot of them.

294
00:17:25.685 --> 00:17:28.310
They take money from people like you.

295
00:17:28.393 --> 00:17:31.726
-You're a victim.
-Not exactly a victim, actually.


296
00:17:31.810 --> 00:17:35.351
If you hadn't paid them,
they would've gone away.


297
00:17:35.435 --> 00:17:38.976
-But you'll take it?
-Yes, but you'd still have your money.


298
00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:40.060
Let's go, Santos.

299
00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:45.685
<i>Alone, with no trailer and no money.</i>

300
00:17:46.601 --> 00:17:47.851
<i>I had nothing left.</i>

301
00:17:50.851 --> 00:17:51.810
<i>I mean…</i>

302
00:17:52.643 --> 00:17:53.851
<i>almost nothing.</i>

303
00:17:59.851 --> 00:18:01.101
<i>I needed to go to Rio.</i>

304
00:18:01.685 --> 00:18:03.226
I'm going to Rio, Jerusa!

305
00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:06.310
<i>In search of the only person</i>
<i>who could help me,</i>


306
00:18:06.393 --> 00:18:07.310
<i>my brother.</i>

307
00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:14.060
<i>He's always been discreet,</i>
<i>but I thought he'd done well in life,</i>


308
00:18:14.601 --> 00:18:16.518
<i>that he'd made it in a big city.</i>

309
00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:18.851
<i>He was doing better than me.</i>

310
00:18:21.185 --> 00:18:24.435
For fuck's sake!

311
00:18:24.518 --> 00:18:25.560
Did I kill you?

312
00:18:29.268 --> 00:18:30.101
Lohane?

313
00:18:30.185 --> 00:18:31.393
Clóvis!

314
00:18:31.476 --> 00:18:33.185
Did you have to show up now?

315
00:18:35.768 --> 00:18:37.851
Wait! Clóvis!

316
00:18:39.685 --> 00:18:41.560
Thank you, Lord!

317
00:18:42.351 --> 00:18:44.226
Clóvis!

318
00:18:48.518 --> 00:18:51.726
Why are you in such a hurry?
You didn't give me a kiss.


319
00:18:53.101 --> 00:18:53.935
Are you late?

320
00:18:54.935 --> 00:18:58.226
Focusing on traffic to avoid answering me.

321
00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:01.851
Talk to the driver only when necessary.

322
00:19:06.935 --> 00:19:08.060
Are you going away?

323
00:19:09.893 --> 00:19:13.018
You don't need to answer.
I don't wanna know.


324
00:19:16.393 --> 00:19:18.518
I thought you had a nicer car.

325
00:19:18.601 --> 00:19:20.518
I'm not judging you or anything.

326
00:19:21.601 --> 00:19:25.018
It's just that we always think
other people are doing well.


327
00:19:25.101 --> 00:19:28.851
I'm not saying you're not.
You're doing better than me.


328
00:19:28.935 --> 00:19:32.226
-But worse than I thought.
-Can't you see I'm focused?


329
00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:33.976
I'm sorry. Relax.

330
00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:36.351
You look like Wesley Safadão.

331
00:19:36.976 --> 00:19:39.476
Because of the hair, I guess.

332
00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:43.226
Your nickname in school
was Clóvis Bornay, remember?


333
00:19:45.476 --> 00:19:47.768
By the way, where are we going?

334
00:19:49.226 --> 00:19:51.393
Can you talk now? 
I need to talk.

335
00:19:51.476 --> 00:19:52.310
No.

336
00:19:57.851 --> 00:20:01.893
We've been driving for hours.
Where are you taking me? I'm curious.


337
00:20:02.476 --> 00:20:04.976
LAKES REGION

338
00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:07.685
This could be considered kidnapping.

339
00:20:09.518 --> 00:20:11.726
Yes, we've been driving for hours.

340
00:20:11.810 --> 00:20:13.768
No, this is not a kidnapping.

341
00:20:13.851 --> 00:20:17.518
I didn't take you against your will.
You entered my car.


342
00:20:17.601 --> 00:20:18.935
Get out, please.

343
00:20:19.685 --> 00:20:22.560
-You're so rude!
-I'm not rude.


344
00:20:22.643 --> 00:20:24.726
I said "please." Get out, please.

345
00:20:25.226 --> 00:20:27.768
-You haven't seen me in ages!
-Get out.


346
00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:31.810
-Clóvis, I need your help.
-Get out!


347
00:20:31.893 --> 00:20:34.310
-I'm in trouble!
-And you think I'm not?


348
00:20:34.393 --> 00:20:36.060
I'm in deep shit, dear.

349
00:20:36.143 --> 00:20:37.726
I'm up to my neck in shit.

350
00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:38.935
Not as bad as me.

351
00:20:39.018 --> 00:20:42.101
-I'm in trouble with the cops!
-Not interested. Move.


352
00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:45.810
Listen up, Clóvis. I have a trailer.

353
00:20:45.893 --> 00:20:49.601
I had one, but the cops confiscated it
for not having a license.


354
00:20:49.685 --> 00:20:54.351
Before that there was another raid,
and I bribed them, but they were fake!


355
00:20:54.435 --> 00:20:57.226
Now I have no money and no trailer!

356
00:20:57.310 --> 00:20:59.643
I have no other
way to make a living.

357
00:21:00.143 --> 00:21:04.310
Then I thought my brother could help me.
I'll pay you back.


358
00:21:04.393 --> 00:21:06.685
I have no money. 
How could I help you?

359
00:21:10.935 --> 00:21:11.810
I understand.

360
00:21:12.851 --> 00:21:14.185
Crooks are everywhere.

361
00:21:14.851 --> 00:21:17.601
You might not believe me,
but I can prove it.


362
00:21:17.685 --> 00:21:18.768
I'll show you.

363
00:21:28.601 --> 00:21:29.935
You're a criminal?

364
00:21:30.018 --> 00:21:33.601
I'm a con artist,
a schemer, not a criminal.


365
00:21:34.185 --> 00:21:35.018
You…

366
00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:39.601
You're just like the scammers
that extorted me, aren't you?


367
00:21:39.685 --> 00:21:40.976
No, I have ethics.

368
00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:42.685
My own ethics, but I do.

369
00:21:42.768 --> 00:21:45.685
I'd never steal a trailer
from an honest worker.


370
00:21:45.768 --> 00:21:48.518
Man, I want nothing to do with you.

371
00:21:49.143 --> 00:21:50.268
No way.

372
00:21:50.351 --> 00:21:52.810
As a matter of fact, #downwithclóvis.

373
00:21:52.893 --> 00:21:54.976
You shouldn't even have come.

374
00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:56.393
Good luck. Bye.

375
00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:02.268
Absolutely not.

376
00:22:02.893 --> 00:22:04.810
I won't ask a crook for help.

377
00:22:04.893 --> 00:22:08.310
I lost my trailer, but I won't do it.

378
00:22:08.393 --> 00:22:10.518
The world is already full of crooks.

379
00:22:10.601 --> 00:22:12.476
This country is full of crooks.

380
00:22:13.226 --> 00:22:14.435
You don't need me?

381
00:22:15.101 --> 00:22:16.435
I don't need you!

382
00:22:20.351 --> 00:22:21.685
Actually, I do.

383
00:22:23.018 --> 00:22:24.893
But God will help me.

384
00:22:28.685 --> 00:22:30.268
Just not yet.

385
00:22:31.893 --> 00:22:35.101
Eventually, He will.
I don't know when, but He will.


386
00:22:36.810 --> 00:22:38.060
I don't deserve this.

387
00:22:39.476 --> 00:22:40.893
I'm completely lost.

388
00:22:46.143 --> 00:22:47.476
That's Clóvis!

389
00:22:49.018 --> 00:22:52.726
-I don't have all day. Where are they?
-I'll find the documents.


390
00:22:53.268 --> 00:22:54.310
My gosh!

391
00:22:55.601 --> 00:22:56.768
What should I do?

392
00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:01.268
I can't find them.
They must be somewhere else.


393
00:23:01.351 --> 00:23:02.268
HIGHWAY PATROL

394
00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:11.185
Come back here, you bastard!

395
00:23:12.351 --> 00:23:15.810
I'm talking to you, scumbag! Asshole!

396
00:23:17.226 --> 00:23:18.310
Prick!

397
00:23:19.851 --> 00:23:20.893
Coward!

398
00:23:21.393 --> 00:23:24.018
You're a lying monster!

399
00:23:24.768 --> 00:23:27.018
You should've never been born!

400
00:23:27.601 --> 00:23:30.310
Sorry, I'll let you do your job
in a minute.


401
00:23:30.393 --> 00:23:32.143
Wait, who are you?

402
00:23:32.226 --> 00:23:33.101
Me?

403
00:23:33.810 --> 00:23:38.768
I'm the idiot who
fell for his sweet talk!

404
00:23:39.393 --> 00:23:41.560
You won't believe this.

405
00:23:43.018 --> 00:23:45.893
This man showed up at my dad's house

406
00:23:46.726 --> 00:23:48.310
and disgraced me!

407
00:23:51.643 --> 00:23:54.226
Okay, it was consensual,

408
00:23:55.268 --> 00:23:57.685
but he used me and ran away.

409
00:23:57.768 --> 00:23:58.893
It's not right!

410
00:23:58.976 --> 00:24:01.226
-Calm down, ma'am.
-Don't call me that!


411
00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:05.726
It reminds me of a book
I was forced to read when I was a kid.


412
00:24:06.310 --> 00:24:07.226
But I didn’t.

413
00:24:07.935 --> 00:24:09.018
I flunked out.

414
00:24:09.601 --> 00:24:11.976
-No, don't do that!
-She's hitting me.


415
00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:13.935
Do you feel sorry for him?

416
00:24:14.018 --> 00:24:17.851
You know what? Arrest me.
Take me away from society.


417
00:24:17.935 --> 00:24:20.435
Just don't make me
live with this crazy woman.


418
00:24:20.518 --> 00:24:23.101
She's crazy. You can all see that!

419
00:24:23.185 --> 00:24:25.351
He wants to be taken away

420
00:24:25.435 --> 00:24:29.393
because he doesn't want
to take responsibility as a father.


421
00:24:29.976 --> 00:24:33.060
-He doesn't want to raise his own child!
-What child?


422
00:24:33.143 --> 00:24:36.185
This one! Inside my belly.

423
00:24:36.268 --> 00:24:39.643
Since when is that a child?
That's a tapeworm!


424
00:24:39.726 --> 00:24:41.810
Do you want me to raise a tapeworm?

425
00:24:41.893 --> 00:24:44.393
Do you want me to christen a tapeworm?

426
00:24:44.476 --> 00:24:46.143
-It's a joke!
-My baby!


427
00:24:46.726 --> 00:24:50.601
Your dad is calling you names
before you're even born!


428
00:24:50.685 --> 00:24:54.726
Do you want the officer here
to force me to pay child support?


429
00:24:54.810 --> 00:24:57.185
-I do! Of course!
-Your mother is crazy!


430
00:24:57.268 --> 00:24:58.768
She is, trust your dad!

431
00:24:58.851 --> 00:24:59.976
You are crazy!

432
00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:03.393
You don't even know
if the baby is really yours!


433
00:25:03.476 --> 00:25:06.560
You are both insane!
Go fight somewhere else!


434
00:25:06.643 --> 00:25:09.976
No! Now I want to work this out.

435
00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:14.518
-No, sir! We are not doing anything here.
-We're going to work this out!


436
00:25:14.601 --> 00:25:17.643
I want to work
this out, brother. Got it?

437
00:25:17.726 --> 00:25:20.560
-I want to work this out!
-Enough!


438
00:25:20.643 --> 00:25:21.893
Enough!

439
00:25:21.976 --> 00:25:23.560
Move along, please,

440
00:25:23.643 --> 00:25:26.393
before I change my mind and arrest you.

441
00:25:26.476 --> 00:25:28.476
-Got it?
-Yes, you're right.


442
00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:29.518
Please.

443
00:25:29.601 --> 00:25:31.935
-Before my water breaks.
-Chill out.


444
00:25:32.018 --> 00:25:33.851
-It's all right, relax.
-Move.


445
00:25:33.935 --> 00:25:35.060
Everything is fine.

446
00:25:35.976 --> 00:25:37.768
I gotta hit the waves today.

447
00:25:47.726 --> 00:25:49.768
The tapeworm was a genius move.

448
00:25:49.851 --> 00:25:52.226
You couldn't believe it when I said that.

449
00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:55.018
I can't believe how you, Clóvis,

450
00:25:55.101 --> 00:25:57.643
such a quiet and shy boy,

451
00:25:57.726 --> 00:25:59.518
turned into a gangster.

452
00:26:00.268 --> 00:26:01.935
I was bullied, honey.

453
00:26:02.018 --> 00:26:04.351
Bullied! I was bullied.

454
00:26:04.435 --> 00:26:06.518
Lady Gaga was bullied, Madonna was.

455
00:26:06.601 --> 00:26:08.726
I heard Tom Cruise was bullied, too.

456
00:26:08.810 --> 00:26:10.518
All amazing people, like me.

457
00:26:10.601 --> 00:26:12.435
Thanks, bullying!

458
00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:14.976
When I was good, 
I got screwed.

459
00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:17.560
Now I'm bad, and things work out.
Isn't it better?


460
00:26:18.226 --> 00:26:19.060
Maybe.

461
00:26:19.893 --> 00:26:22.310
Look at you. You just fooled the police.

462
00:26:22.393 --> 00:26:23.851
You'll get me a trailer.

463
00:26:23.935 --> 00:26:25.393
-What?
-You heard me.


464
00:26:25.476 --> 00:26:27.976
I saved you. Now
you'll get me a trailer.

465
00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:28.893
Blackmail?

466
00:26:28.976 --> 00:26:30.518
You're my brother, Clóvis.

467
00:26:31.101 --> 00:26:33.935
I have nothing left.
Could you help me out?


468
00:26:40.935 --> 00:26:41.935
Okay.

469
00:26:42.893 --> 00:26:44.726
I'll figure something out.

470
00:26:44.810 --> 00:26:47.226
But after that, we'll part ways.

471
00:26:48.643 --> 00:26:50.560
Get off me. No!

472
00:26:53.143 --> 00:26:54.935
<i>What are you doing?</i>

473
00:26:55.018 --> 00:26:56.226
Making a reservation.

474
00:26:57.893 --> 00:26:59.643
Without any money in it?

475
00:27:00.518 --> 00:27:02.560
Let me explain one thing to you.

476
00:27:02.643 --> 00:27:04.101
I need my trailer,

477
00:27:04.185 --> 00:27:06.935
but I assumed you would get one honestly.

478
00:27:07.018 --> 00:27:09.226
You really did?

479
00:27:09.310 --> 00:27:10.310
How nice.

480
00:27:10.393 --> 00:27:12.393
Relax, it's just a magic trick.

481
00:27:12.476 --> 00:27:16.601
Instead of pulling a rabbit out of my hat,
I'll pull it out of someone else's hat.


482
00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:29.143
I won't stay here. Forget it.

483
00:27:29.226 --> 00:27:30.685
I have dignity.

484
00:27:31.351 --> 00:27:32.976
Great, because I'll stay.

485
00:27:38.226 --> 00:27:39.060
What's up?

486
00:27:39.143 --> 00:27:40.851
-Good morning.
-Good morning.


487
00:27:40.935 --> 00:27:42.976
-Do you have a reservation?
-I do.


488
00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:44.643
-How are you doing?
-Great.


489
00:27:44.726 --> 00:27:46.851
It's under the name Máximo Marques.

490
00:27:46.935 --> 00:27:48.976
I made a deposit earlier.

491
00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:53.685
I had a problem with my online account,
and I made the deposit at the bank.


492
00:27:53.768 --> 00:27:54.726
So annoying.

493
00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:58.810
I found it. You paid for ten days
in the premium suite.


494
00:27:58.893 --> 00:27:59.726
Very good.

495
00:27:59.810 --> 00:28:04.268
However, the deposit will be credited
only on Monday.


496
00:28:05.893 --> 00:28:06.976
So?

497
00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:11.893
I can't rest after a long trip
because banks don't open on weekends?


498
00:28:11.976 --> 00:28:16.268
That's not what I mean, sir.
Technically, it hasn't been paid yet.


499
00:28:16.851 --> 00:28:18.935
But I made the deposit.

500
00:28:19.018 --> 00:28:20.476
It's really weird.

501
00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:23.393
Our money is promptly debited
when we transfer it,


502
00:28:23.476 --> 00:28:28.935
but when we make a deposit,
it takes a long time to clear.


503
00:28:29.018 --> 00:28:30.476
Banks love to credit it,

504
00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:32.476
they take forever to do so.

505
00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:33.810
Then, I ask you:

506
00:28:33.893 --> 00:28:36.310
If my money hasn't been transferred,

507
00:28:36.393 --> 00:28:37.643
where is it?

508
00:28:38.851 --> 00:28:41.268
Yes, that is a good question.

509
00:28:41.351 --> 00:28:44.393
Thank God,
who never rests for a single day,


510
00:28:44.476 --> 00:28:45.976
we are honest people.

511
00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:47.268
-Right?
-Amen.


512
00:28:47.351 --> 00:28:49.435
I'm here on business. I'm tired.

513
00:28:49.518 --> 00:28:51.226
I work on weekends, unlike banks.

514
00:28:52.643 --> 00:28:54.976
I just need my room keys, please.

515
00:28:55.643 --> 00:28:56.810
Of course.

516
00:28:59.601 --> 00:29:01.351
-Here they are.
-Great.


517
00:29:01.435 --> 00:29:04.143
Clóvis, I don't agree
with the things you do.


518
00:29:04.226 --> 00:29:06.435
Really? That's your problem.

519
00:29:06.518 --> 00:29:08.393
But I'm loving this.

520
00:29:08.476 --> 00:29:10.726
-How are you doing?
-Hi.


521
00:29:11.685 --> 00:29:13.435
I never go anywhere.

522
00:29:14.185 --> 00:29:17.018
You need time and money to travel.

523
00:29:17.101 --> 00:29:21.060
A worker with time is unemployed,
so there's no money left to travel.


524
00:29:21.143 --> 00:29:23.143
It just doesn't add up, Clóvis.

525
00:29:23.810 --> 00:29:27.768
The only trip I've been making
is to get the fake mayo I serve.


526
00:29:27.851 --> 00:29:31.601
You serve fake mayonnaise, how nice!

527
00:29:31.685 --> 00:29:34.643
Otherwise, I'd have no mayonnaise to sell.

528
00:29:34.726 --> 00:29:38.476
My dream is to be able to serve
a fancy mayonnaise


529
00:29:39.143 --> 00:29:40.393
and thick napkins.

530
00:29:40.476 --> 00:29:42.476
You're annoying. 
You talk a lot.

531
00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:43.810
Don't be like that.

532
00:29:44.393 --> 00:29:46.768
This place is so beautiful, right?

533
00:29:46.851 --> 00:29:47.685
No.

534
00:29:49.018 --> 00:29:52.268
I'm in love.

535
00:29:52.351 --> 00:29:54.893
-Give me your number!
-Where are you going?


536
00:29:54.976 --> 00:29:57.185
Following those fishes. I'm a shark.

537
00:29:57.685 --> 00:29:59.810
-Come back here.
-Where are we going?


538
00:29:59.893 --> 00:30:02.560
I'll buy you some clothes.
Those are awful.


539
00:30:02.643 --> 00:30:06.935
I never thought you were capable
of doing things like this, Clóvis.


540
00:30:08.935 --> 00:30:11.601
-I refuse to go in.
-Shut up. Come on.


541
00:30:12.935 --> 00:30:14.393
Hello, how are you doing?

542
00:30:14.476 --> 00:30:16.393
-Good afternoon.
-Good afternoon.


543
00:30:16.476 --> 00:30:18.685
I brought my sister for a shopping spree.

544
00:30:18.768 --> 00:30:21.685
Not just a spree,
she needs to go on a binge.


545
00:30:21.768 --> 00:30:24.018
She needs a complete makeover.

546
00:30:24.726 --> 00:30:26.185
I love that dress.

547
00:30:30.226 --> 00:30:31.060
Jesus Christ!

548
00:30:31.143 --> 00:30:32.643
What's her size? Small?

549
00:30:32.726 --> 00:30:36.226
No, it's small, medium and large.
She's all lopsided.


550
00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:38.393
One thigh is bigger than the other,

551
00:30:38.476 --> 00:30:40.976
one breast is bigger, her butt's weird.

552
00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:41.893
Asymmetrical.

553
00:30:41.976 --> 00:30:46.560
If you compared her to an anatomy book,
you'd see she's an alien.


554
00:30:46.643 --> 00:30:50.476
If you laid her down naked,
at first you'd be confused.


555
00:30:51.726 --> 00:30:55.060
I got it, silly.
Could you get me a coffee?


556
00:30:55.143 --> 00:30:57.101
-You scared me!
-One more.


557
00:30:57.185 --> 00:30:58.726
-I can't!
-You can!


558
00:30:58.810 --> 00:31:00.768
And don't argue with me.

559
00:31:00.851 --> 00:31:05.143
Leave those and return some pieces.
Tell her you won't buy anything.


560
00:31:05.226 --> 00:31:08.226
No! Lord, forgive me!

561
00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:11.976
It's not my fault! I'm so sorry!

562
00:31:30.601 --> 00:31:33.351
So, I guess I won't take anything.

563
00:31:33.435 --> 00:31:36.768
Come on! At least one piece.

564
00:31:36.851 --> 00:31:37.768
He's right.

565
00:31:37.851 --> 00:31:40.726
Nothing really fits me, thank you.

566
00:31:40.810 --> 00:31:42.810
You're upset because you got fat.

567
00:31:43.476 --> 00:31:46.018
I retain water in my upper body.

568
00:31:46.101 --> 00:31:48.101
She's feeling bad about herself.

569
00:31:48.185 --> 00:31:50.601
We must buy dream clothes,

570
00:31:50.685 --> 00:31:54.726
those clothes you swear
you'll lose weight to wear one day.


571
00:31:54.810 --> 00:31:56.643
I have lots of them at home.

572
00:31:56.726 --> 00:31:58.643
-Bye!
-They'll fit me someday.


573
00:31:58.726 --> 00:32:02.101
-Let's go, please.
-You're full of security tags.


574
00:32:02.185 --> 00:32:04.726
If you pass the detector,
you might explode.


575
00:32:04.810 --> 00:32:06.810
My God, I can't go to jail!

576
00:32:06.893 --> 00:32:09.976
Relax, we got this. 
We just have to wait.

577
00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:17.268
Now, come on.

578
00:32:17.351 --> 00:32:20.393
-I can't believe it.
-Good luck.


579
00:32:20.476 --> 00:32:21.893
She won't buy anything.

580
00:32:21.976 --> 00:32:24.060
She needs to see her shrink.

581
00:32:24.143 --> 00:32:25.976
-Thanks for the magazine.
-Sure!


582
00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:29.643
That poor tourist.

583
00:32:29.726 --> 00:32:32.810
It's every man for himself in Brazil.

584
00:32:32.893 --> 00:32:35.143
That car ran the light, and it's gone.

585
00:32:35.226 --> 00:32:36.976
The one who didn't is far behind.

586
00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:39.768
It did the right thing.
We gotta respect it.


587
00:32:39.851 --> 00:32:43.351
I found an honest Brazilian!
I've never seen one.


588
00:32:43.435 --> 00:32:45.101
I'll alert the media.

589
00:32:45.185 --> 00:32:47.893
If it's your third
time, you get a song.

590
00:32:47.976 --> 00:32:53.143
Man, you framed an innocent person
and made our country look bad.


591
00:32:53.226 --> 00:32:55.601
Brazil already has a bad reputation.

592
00:32:55.685 --> 00:32:59.226
The cameras will show
that I placed the clothes in her bag,


593
00:32:59.310 --> 00:33:00.601
and she'll be okay.

594
00:33:00.685 --> 00:33:02.601
How could you?

595
00:33:02.685 --> 00:33:05.976
Not having money, that's how I did it.

596
00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:07.310
Let's keep an eye out.

597
00:33:07.393 --> 00:33:09.851
They'll come after us,
and I've only just started.


598
00:33:09.935 --> 00:33:12.268
BOAT RIDES

599
00:33:17.185 --> 00:33:19.018
Wasn't this supposed to be fast?

600
00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:22.893
We've been here for hours.
I'm on my fifth slushy.


601
00:33:22.976 --> 00:33:26.435
We're studying the area.
Do you see that boat ride agency?


602
00:33:26.518 --> 00:33:28.101
They only take cash or checks.

603
00:33:28.185 --> 00:33:31.768
We must wait
for someone to pay with a check,


604
00:33:31.851 --> 00:33:33.976
take a picture of the signature,

605
00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:36.601
then forge a new check
and exchange it with the original.


606
00:33:36.685 --> 00:33:39.393
-Robbing a bank is easier.
-And we will.


607
00:33:39.476 --> 00:33:41.518
-Rob a bank?
-Yes.


608
00:33:42.185 --> 00:33:45.310
That woman looks like
she's going to rent a boat.


609
00:33:45.393 --> 00:33:47.518
-Go over there.
-To do what?


610
00:33:47.601 --> 00:33:50.226
-Take a picture of the check!
-How?


611
00:33:50.310 --> 00:33:52.435
Figure it out and bring it to me.

612
00:33:52.518 --> 00:33:54.476
Okay, hold it. God, help me.

613
00:33:56.393 --> 00:34:01.435
There's also Forte Beach,
which is our most famous beach.


614
00:34:01.518 --> 00:34:03.851
And our special trips, like Peró Beach.

615
00:34:03.935 --> 00:34:06.435
We have a 16-foot speedboat

616
00:34:06.518 --> 00:34:09.101
and a schooner that will be leaving soon,

617
00:34:09.185 --> 00:34:11.685
but we still have tickets for this trip.

618
00:34:12.685 --> 00:34:14.976
-Hi.
-Hi. I'm checking this mask out.


619
00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:18.976
If I wear this mask,
I'll scare all the fishes.


620
00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:21.226
I'll clear out the ocean.

621
00:34:21.310 --> 00:34:22.935
Like an extinction.

622
00:34:23.685 --> 00:34:27.726
Let me ask you.
Do you only have rides with 500 people?


623
00:34:27.810 --> 00:34:28.893
-No, we--
-What?


624
00:34:30.310 --> 00:34:34.851
Sorry. That's the fun part,

625
00:34:34.935 --> 00:34:37.101
I like it better that way. 
I prefer that.

626
00:34:37.185 --> 00:34:40.351
Do you have something more exclusive?

627
00:34:40.435 --> 00:34:42.143
Like a boat or a yacht?

628
00:34:42.226 --> 00:34:45.393
You could buy all the tickets
of a medium ride


629
00:34:45.476 --> 00:34:46.685
and take your friends.

630
00:34:46.768 --> 00:34:48.476
Great. How much is that?

631
00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:50.393
-A thousand reais.
-A thousand reais?


632
00:34:50.476 --> 00:34:51.518
Yeah, a thousand.

633
00:34:51.601 --> 00:34:55.018
To be on a boat alone,
without a single guy to flirt with?


634
00:34:56.226 --> 00:34:59.226
Well, I saw a sailor over there
with huge feet.


635
00:34:59.310 --> 00:35:02.976
Imagine him pulling the anchor
with those strong arms.


636
00:35:03.643 --> 00:35:04.893
Smart girl!

637
00:35:05.643 --> 00:35:06.851
I like-
- Sorry.

638
00:35:06.935 --> 00:35:08.768
Sorry, this is a private deal.

639
00:35:08.851 --> 00:35:10.935
-Do you take credit cards?
-I'll take a selfie.


640
00:35:11.018 --> 00:35:13.268
-No, just cash or check.
-Okay.


641
00:35:14.101 --> 00:35:16.393
-Great lighting.
-It's a beautiful day.


642
00:35:16.476 --> 00:35:17.893
It's wonderful.

643
00:35:17.976 --> 00:35:19.768
Very good.

644
00:35:20.935 --> 00:35:23.893
This is a good angle. Sorry.

645
00:35:26.393 --> 00:35:28.935
Some people don't know when to stop.

646
00:35:30.101 --> 00:35:34.185
Are you talking to me? Look at me, then.
Why are you looking at her?


647
00:35:34.268 --> 00:35:36.518
Such a snob. What an awful establishment!

648
00:35:36.601 --> 00:35:39.101
A seedy place with a smelly dog.

649
00:35:39.185 --> 00:35:40.768
Your dog is filthy.

650
00:35:40.851 --> 00:35:43.935
My goodness, that smell!

651
00:35:44.018 --> 00:35:46.893
What an awful establishment! My goodness.

652
00:35:52.393 --> 00:35:55.726
-Hello! Good afternoon.
-Good afternoon, how are you?


653
00:35:55.810 --> 00:35:58.393
I hope you're doing fine, because I'm not.

654
00:35:58.893 --> 00:36:00.393
My boss is pissed.

655
00:36:00.476 --> 00:36:03.226
I didn't introduce myself. I'm Wendell.

656
00:36:03.310 --> 00:36:07.935
I'm Silvia's driver,
who has just rented a boat, actually.


657
00:36:08.018 --> 00:36:10.476
-That lady.
-Exactly. Is your boss nice?


658
00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:11.768
They never are.

659
00:36:11.851 --> 00:36:14.560
But it's not your fault.
It was a girl taking selfies.


660
00:36:14.643 --> 00:36:15.518
Do you like them?

661
00:36:15.601 --> 00:36:16.851
I'm fine with them,

662
00:36:16.935 --> 00:36:18.935
but that girl kept talking.

663
00:36:19.018 --> 00:36:23.726
Do you get confused with fast speaking?
I don't, but my boss does.


664
00:36:23.810 --> 00:36:27.018
She made my boss confuse the checks.

665
00:36:27.101 --> 00:36:31.101
She gave you the wrong one
and asked me to get it back


666
00:36:31.185 --> 00:36:32.768
and give you this one.

667
00:36:32.851 --> 00:36:33.726
-Okay?
-Right.


668
00:36:33.810 --> 00:36:36.351
It's all the same,
but the bank is different.


669
00:36:36.851 --> 00:36:39.893
-All right, then.
-Could you hurry up?


670
00:36:39.976 --> 00:36:42.726
She's waiting outside,
and she's in a terrible mood.


671
00:36:43.310 --> 00:36:44.601
-You know?
-Yes.


672
00:36:45.435 --> 00:36:48.810
-Impatient. She's…
-I'll just check it.


673
00:36:48.893 --> 00:36:51.185
-It's all the same but the bank.
-Okay.


674
00:36:51.268 --> 00:36:52.643
-All right.
-Awesome.


675
00:36:52.726 --> 00:36:54.851
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.


676
00:36:55.476 --> 00:36:56.935
<i>Eleven thousand reais.</i>

677
00:36:58.976 --> 00:37:01.685
The number 11 is too squeezed up.

678
00:37:02.310 --> 00:37:04.060
Sorry, but I can't.

679
00:37:04.143 --> 00:37:07.393
-Hi, how are you? Good afternoon.
-Good afternoon.


680
00:37:07.476 --> 00:37:11.060
So, what does it say on there?
"Eleven thousand reais," right?


681
00:37:11.851 --> 00:37:13.185
So, that's what it is.

682
00:37:13.268 --> 00:37:15.726
And it's urgent. 
I need this money.

683
00:37:15.810 --> 00:37:18.518
But first I need to contact the issuer.

684
00:37:18.601 --> 00:37:21.643
It's someone who suffers from Parkinson's.
Have you heard of it?


685
00:37:22.643 --> 00:37:25.143
I really need the bank's confirmation.

686
00:37:25.226 --> 00:37:26.101
All right.

687
00:37:26.185 --> 00:37:28.810
Ladies and gentlemen,
your attention, please.


688
00:37:28.893 --> 00:37:32.268
Sorry to bother you,
but I need to say something.


689
00:37:32.351 --> 00:37:35.976
The bank takes our money
but never gets us off, you know?


690
00:37:36.810 --> 00:37:40.393
My Aunt Silvia, who raised me,
has Parkinson's.


691
00:37:41.268 --> 00:37:45.643
The poor thing insisted
on using her own frail hands


692
00:37:45.726 --> 00:37:47.393
to write the check.

693
00:37:47.476 --> 00:37:52.101
She felt alive, she felt useful,
she felt active, you know?


694
00:37:52.185 --> 00:37:55.851
Because the check is a donation
from her to a child in need.


695
00:37:55.935 --> 00:37:59.143
However, she says her handwriting is bad.

696
00:37:59.226 --> 00:38:01.310
Of course, she has Parkinson's!

697
00:38:01.393 --> 00:38:03.976
-The number is squeezed up.
-You're lying!


698
00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:06.810
-I didn't say anything!
-Really?


699
00:38:06.893 --> 00:38:10.851
Now she didn't say anything.
She prefers the silence of cowardice.


700
00:38:10.935 --> 00:38:14.643
That's not on her behalf.
She's acting on the bank's behalf.


701
00:38:14.726 --> 00:38:18.560
She's not sparing her money.
She's sparing the bank's money!


702
00:38:18.643 --> 00:38:20.351
Does the bank spare us?

703
00:38:20.435 --> 00:38:22.643
-No!
-No, it doesn't!


704
00:38:22.726 --> 00:38:24.518
I wanna be a
bank in my next life.

705
00:38:24.601 --> 00:38:27.976
They're always forgiven,
but they never forgive anybody.


706
00:38:28.060 --> 00:38:30.726
Look at the special treatment line.

707
00:38:30.810 --> 00:38:32.143
Especially slow!

708
00:38:32.226 --> 00:38:36.101
It is outrageous to make seniors wait.

709
00:38:36.185 --> 00:38:38.726
It's horrible. 
They are elderly!

710
00:38:38.810 --> 00:38:42.101
Have you ever heard of the fourth age?

711
00:38:42.185 --> 00:38:44.185
No? Why? Because it doesn't exist!

712
00:38:44.726 --> 00:38:46.601
The third age is the last one!

713
00:38:46.685 --> 00:38:50.643
Every minute of their lives
is precious, you see?


714
00:38:50.726 --> 00:38:54.226
One of them might pass away right here.

715
00:38:54.310 --> 00:38:57.226
Look at her, eating anxiously.

716
00:38:57.310 --> 00:39:00.685
She's all anxious,
eating cookies, nonstop chewing.


717
00:39:00.768 --> 00:39:02.685
Her anxiety is the bank's fault.

718
00:39:02.768 --> 00:39:04.643
She stands there for hours,

719
00:39:04.726 --> 00:39:06.435
so she eats to pass the time.

720
00:39:06.518 --> 00:39:10.268
She was thin when she came in here.
Look at her now.


721
00:39:10.351 --> 00:39:12.601
She might explode right here.

722
00:39:12.685 --> 00:39:16.768
How about the revolving doors?
They are hell on Earth!


723
00:39:16.851 --> 00:39:20.435
We even give up coming in
for fear of getting stuck.


724
00:39:20.518 --> 00:39:22.226
They treat us like criminals.

725
00:39:22.310 --> 00:39:23.935
We become criminals.

726
00:39:24.018 --> 00:39:26.185
We take out our phones, keys, everything.

727
00:39:26.268 --> 00:39:27.810
They ask for our pacemakers.

728
00:39:27.893 --> 00:39:30.893
Someone might have
a heart attack right here.


729
00:39:30.976 --> 00:39:34.560
And it's all the bank's fault!

730
00:39:34.643 --> 00:39:35.976
That's right!

731
00:39:36.060 --> 00:39:38.393
We want respect!

732
00:39:39.893 --> 00:39:43.393
Respect! We want respect!

733
00:39:44.685 --> 00:39:47.851
Listen, I'm not holding up the line
because I want to.


734
00:39:47.935 --> 00:39:49.601
They won't cash my check.

735
00:39:49.685 --> 00:39:51.143
Cash it!

736
00:39:51.226 --> 00:39:53.393
Cash his check!

737
00:39:54.060 --> 00:39:57.851
Listen to the voice of experience.
He is very experienced.


738
00:39:57.935 --> 00:39:59.601
Cash his check already!

739
00:39:59.685 --> 00:40:02.726
Even our chubby friend agrees.
I can say that. I'm chubby too.


740
00:40:02.810 --> 00:40:04.976
Cash it already!

741
00:40:05.060 --> 00:40:08.893
-Cash his check!
-Cash it!


742
00:40:08.976 --> 00:40:11.435
The giant has awakened.

743
00:40:11.518 --> 00:40:15.851
<i>Giant by thine own nature</i>

744
00:40:15.935 --> 00:40:19.351
<i>Thou art beautiful, strong</i>
<i>A fearless colossus</i>


745
00:40:19.435 --> 00:40:22.768
<i>And thy future mirrors that greatness</i>

746
00:40:22.851 --> 00:40:24.476
<i>Adored land</i>

747
00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:28.268
<i>Amongst a thousand others</i>
<i>Art thou, Brazil, beloved homeland</i>


748
00:40:28.351 --> 00:40:31.185
<i>Of the sons of this ground</i>
<i>Thou art kind mother</i>


749
00:40:31.268 --> 00:40:33.351
<i>Beloved homeland, Brazil!</i>

750
00:40:35.851 --> 00:40:36.851
Yeah!

751
00:40:39.726 --> 00:40:44.268
-Cash it!
-Cash it!


752
00:40:44.851 --> 00:40:45.851
I've got goosebumps.

753
00:40:48.226 --> 00:40:50.226
Didn't I say I'd rob a bank?

754
00:40:50.310 --> 00:40:52.601
-You robbed Silvia!
-What?


755
00:40:52.685 --> 00:40:54.518
She is the victim of a scam.

756
00:40:54.601 --> 00:40:57.351
The bank's loss is our gain.

757
00:40:57.435 --> 00:41:01.060
Eleven thousand reais, man!

758
00:41:01.143 --> 00:41:03.560
I've never seen so
much money in my life!

759
00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:05.810
-What's my share?
-None.


760
00:41:06.435 --> 00:41:08.226
You're getting greedy.

761
00:41:08.310 --> 00:41:10.726
I'll buy your trailer tomorrow.

762
00:41:11.310 --> 00:41:12.226
And then what?

763
00:41:12.310 --> 00:41:14.685
Then we'll part ways, as we agreed.

764
00:41:14.768 --> 00:41:15.601
No.

765
00:41:16.101 --> 00:41:17.935
I won't accept that.

766
00:41:18.018 --> 00:41:20.893
Didn't you come after
me to get a trailer?

767
00:41:20.976 --> 00:41:25.435
So, let's go out, have some fun.
When was the last time we did that?


768
00:41:25.518 --> 00:41:27.351
There's a party near the hotel.

769
00:41:27.435 --> 00:41:30.101
No way, the entire city is after us.

770
00:41:31.476 --> 00:41:32.685
Where are you going?

771
00:41:33.185 --> 00:41:36.893
To the sauna, to
relax after a hard day.

772
00:41:36.976 --> 00:41:39.976
Sauna? Let's party, man!

773
00:41:40.060 --> 00:41:41.810
No party, Lohane.

774
00:41:41.893 --> 00:41:43.518
We're done for today.

775
00:41:43.601 --> 00:41:45.768
I'll go to the sauna,
and you'll go to bed.


776
00:41:45.851 --> 00:41:48.101
-You'll lie down and rest.
-I will not!


777
00:41:48.185 --> 00:41:51.185
Because a woman of your age,
in your situation,


778
00:41:51.268 --> 00:41:52.435
is all wrong.

779
00:41:52.518 --> 00:41:54.601
What about my age?

780
00:41:55.851 --> 00:41:56.935
Clóvis?

781
00:41:58.101 --> 00:42:00.018
Clóvis, open the door!

782
00:42:00.101 --> 00:42:01.393
Clóvis!

783
00:42:10.685 --> 00:42:11.851
Lohane?

784
00:42:12.476 --> 00:42:13.351
Lohane.

785
00:42:13.976 --> 00:42:15.310
We need to talk.

786
00:42:16.435 --> 00:42:17.935
Lohane, answer me.

787
00:42:18.643 --> 00:42:19.643
Lohane.

788
00:42:21.185 --> 00:42:23.810
No way! I can't believe it!

789
00:42:33.851 --> 00:42:34.935
Lohane?

790
00:42:35.018 --> 00:42:36.768
Are you hitting on my wife?

791
00:42:36.851 --> 00:42:37.810
Are you serious?

792
00:42:37.893 --> 00:42:40.601
I won't even answer that. Look at me!

793
00:42:40.685 --> 00:42:42.101
I don't know your wife!

794
00:42:42.185 --> 00:42:45.393
Do you know why? She is a woman!
I'm not interested.


795
00:42:45.476 --> 00:42:46.560
Please.

796
00:42:47.893 --> 00:42:49.143
Where's that weirdo?

797
00:42:50.643 --> 00:42:53.851
-There she is. I found you!
-Ouch! Stop it!


798
00:42:53.935 --> 00:42:56.351
-Fugitive!
-I thought you were robbing me.


799
00:42:56.435 --> 00:42:57.893
Where are you going?

800
00:42:57.976 --> 00:43:00.226
I'm trying to get us in the party.

801
00:43:00.310 --> 00:43:03.351
-This lame party?
-Wait a minute, Clóvis!


802
00:43:03.435 --> 00:43:06.310
-Back to the hotel now!
-You're hurting me!


803
00:43:06.393 --> 00:43:09.310
-But I wanna go to the party!
-Stop it, girl.


804
00:43:09.393 --> 00:43:11.435
-Just a little bit, Clóvis!
-No way!


805
00:43:11.518 --> 00:43:14.143
-Please, just 30 minutes.
-Let go of my arm.


806
00:43:14.226 --> 00:43:15.976
-Let's have some fun!
-Get off me!


807
00:43:16.060 --> 00:43:17.851
-Come with me!
-Let me go now!


808
00:43:21.893 --> 00:43:23.060
Sorry.

809
00:43:24.351 --> 00:43:26.518
Look what you did, girl.

810
00:43:26.601 --> 00:43:29.476
You told me to let
you go, so I did.

811
00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:32.310
I just took a
shower, now I'm a mess.

812
00:43:32.393 --> 00:43:34.601
Look. I can't believe it, Lohane.

813
00:43:35.143 --> 00:43:36.101
Just look at it.

814
00:43:42.060 --> 00:43:43.393
It was not my fault.

815
00:43:44.351 --> 00:43:45.310
I want a hug.

816
00:43:45.393 --> 00:43:48.351
-No, Clóvis! Don't be resentful, wait!
-Hug me.


817
00:43:48.435 --> 00:43:51.560
You! You're the man who scammed me!

818
00:43:51.643 --> 00:43:52.476
Run!

819
00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:55.185
-She's crazy! Where's my check?
-Come back!


820
00:43:55.268 --> 00:43:57.060
-Where's my check?
-Get them!


821
00:43:57.143 --> 00:43:59.351
Stop those thieves!

822
00:44:00.726 --> 00:44:01.601
Run!

823
00:44:05.435 --> 00:44:09.310
See what you did, you idiot?
You should've listened to me.


824
00:44:09.393 --> 00:44:12.060
Now I won't even be able
to rest in this hotel.


825
00:44:12.143 --> 00:44:13.851
I'm so nervous!

826
00:44:13.935 --> 00:44:16.268
I can't go to jail, Clóvis!

827
00:44:16.351 --> 00:44:20.310
Listen, get our stuff from the room
and meet me at the car.


828
00:44:30.685 --> 00:44:32.185
May I help you?

829
00:44:32.268 --> 00:44:34.268
Hello, good evening. How are you?

830
00:44:34.351 --> 00:44:37.310
I would like to check out.

831
00:44:38.185 --> 00:44:39.935
Is there a problem?

832
00:44:40.018 --> 00:44:41.726
The hotel is a shithole.

833
00:44:41.810 --> 00:44:43.893
Actually, this city is a shithole.

834
00:44:43.976 --> 00:44:44.893
The state.

835
00:44:44.976 --> 00:44:46.310
The country.

836
00:44:46.393 --> 00:44:48.476
The planet is a shithole.

837
00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:51.268
If I could,
I'd check out of the Milky Way.


838
00:44:51.935 --> 00:44:54.435
But I can't even die. 
Where would I go?

839
00:44:54.518 --> 00:44:55.893
What if it's worse?

840
00:44:55.976 --> 00:44:57.810
Hurry up, kid. I have to go.

841
00:44:57.893 --> 00:45:00.060
So, will you cancel the deposit?

842
00:45:00.143 --> 00:45:02.435
Of course not. 
It's already been done.

843
00:45:02.518 --> 00:45:05.518
You'll get it on Monday.
Just refund the difference.


844
00:45:05.601 --> 00:45:07.643
I can't refund what we don't have.

845
00:45:07.726 --> 00:45:09.435
Listen up, kid.

846
00:45:09.935 --> 00:45:11.601
I'm already all dirty.

847
00:45:11.685 --> 00:45:14.643
Do you want to make it even worse?

848
00:45:14.726 --> 00:45:16.476
-Give my money back.
-No.


849
00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:17.935
Are you trying to scam me?

850
00:45:18.018 --> 00:45:20.476
I'll refund your money on Monday.

851
00:45:20.560 --> 00:45:23.976
I'll be far away from here on Monday,
so help me God.


852
00:45:24.060 --> 00:45:26.268
Not even all the sea here

853
00:45:26.351 --> 00:45:29.060
can wash away all the shit
that was done to me.


854
00:45:29.143 --> 00:45:30.768
Unfortunately, you must wait.

855
00:45:30.851 --> 00:45:32.810
Okay, I'll wait.

856
00:45:33.476 --> 00:45:35.935
But I'll sit so I won't get tired.

857
00:45:36.018 --> 00:45:38.060
No, sir, please.

858
00:45:38.143 --> 00:45:39.143
So nice.

859
00:45:39.226 --> 00:45:42.018
Don't do that, please.
For the love of God!


860
00:45:42.101 --> 00:45:45.351
-No, please.
-I am tired! I'm gonna lie down.


861
00:45:45.435 --> 00:45:48.601
-It's so comfortable. I'm sleepy.
-No, sir.


862
00:45:48.685 --> 00:45:51.226
-So good.
-For God's sake, don't do that!


863
00:45:51.310 --> 00:45:53.643
-Stand up, please!
-Okay.


864
00:45:53.726 --> 00:45:55.393
No problem, I'm sorry.

865
00:45:55.476 --> 00:45:56.560
I just ran into this.

866
00:45:56.643 --> 00:45:57.851
You'll pay for it!

867
00:46:00.435 --> 00:46:03.560
So, give me my money back!

868
00:46:06.226 --> 00:46:07.268
Wow, dude.

869
00:46:07.351 --> 00:46:09.685
We came out on top, Clóvis!

870
00:46:10.226 --> 00:46:13.268
Yesterday I was down, but today I'm rich!

871
00:46:13.351 --> 00:46:14.976
We came out on top?

872
00:46:15.601 --> 00:46:17.976
There's no "we." Who's "we"?

873
00:46:18.060 --> 00:46:20.893
We are different. 
You want other things.

874
00:46:20.976 --> 00:46:22.601
You just want to have fun,

875
00:46:22.685 --> 00:46:24.893
to party, you know?

876
00:46:24.976 --> 00:46:28.643
Not me. I'm all dirty.
I couldn't even take a shower.


877
00:46:29.476 --> 00:46:30.893
We're different, Lohane.

878
00:46:31.393 --> 00:46:33.768
I wanna be alone. 
I like it that way.

879
00:46:36.060 --> 00:46:37.060
Like Greta Garbo.

880
00:46:38.310 --> 00:46:41.935
I'll buy your trailer in the morning,
and then we're done.


881
00:46:44.060 --> 00:46:45.935
Why are you being so rude?

882
00:46:46.768 --> 00:46:47.893
Let's try to sleep.

883
00:47:08.810 --> 00:47:09.685
Nasty.

884
00:47:15.393 --> 00:47:16.768
This is your trailer.

885
00:47:19.310 --> 00:47:22.685
No, this is not a trailer.
I wanted a trailer.


886
00:47:22.768 --> 00:47:24.393
You wanted one, past tense.

887
00:47:24.476 --> 00:47:26.685
It's all we have. 
Don't you like it?

888
00:47:27.893 --> 00:47:30.976
Look, a trailer is ideal
for making burgers.


889
00:47:31.893 --> 00:47:34.101
Where is your Brazilian creativity?

890
00:47:34.185 --> 00:47:36.018
Where are your survival skills?

891
00:47:36.101 --> 00:47:38.393
We know how to reinvent ourselves!

892
00:47:38.476 --> 00:47:41.268
You can use this van
to come up with a deal.


893
00:47:41.351 --> 00:47:42.560
The Van Combo!

894
00:47:42.643 --> 00:47:44.935
I am tired of being Brazilian, then!

895
00:47:45.018 --> 00:47:46.435
That's your loss,

896
00:47:46.518 --> 00:47:49.185
because we've made
invaluable contributions.


897
00:47:49.268 --> 00:47:53.185
The airplane, wristwatches,
electronic voting, hair straightening


898
00:47:53.268 --> 00:47:56.768
and the most famous one,
the Brazilian wax.


899
00:47:56.851 --> 00:47:59.185
-The full bikini wax.
-No.


900
00:47:59.268 --> 00:48:04.226
A full bikini wax is awful for peeing
because the pee goes everywhere.


901
00:48:04.310 --> 00:48:06.851
-I don't need all this information.
-You do!


902
00:48:06.935 --> 00:48:10.185
Women suffer in these horrible bathrooms!

903
00:48:10.268 --> 00:48:13.060
We need to work our quadriceps to pee,

904
00:48:13.143 --> 00:48:15.643
and the stream
must be steady and straight.


905
00:48:15.726 --> 00:48:17.643
Okay, I don't wanna know that.

906
00:48:17.726 --> 00:48:18.935
Do we agree on the van?

907
00:48:21.226 --> 00:48:22.976
-Do I have a choice?
-No.


908
00:48:31.893 --> 00:48:33.435
So, this is it. Thank you.

909
00:48:35.101 --> 00:48:36.060
You're welcome.

910
00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:37.726
It was my pleasure.

911
00:48:39.351 --> 00:48:40.476
See you around?

912
00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:42.935
Maybe. Life is unpredictable.

913
00:48:43.560 --> 00:48:44.518
Okay, then.

914
00:48:44.601 --> 00:48:45.810
All right, then.

915
00:48:46.393 --> 00:48:47.310
Great.

916
00:48:47.393 --> 00:48:48.310
Great, then.

917
00:48:48.810 --> 00:48:50.560
Goodbye.

918
00:48:51.476 --> 00:48:53.226
Now is goodbye for real.

919
00:48:53.810 --> 00:48:56.768
Good luck, Clóvis. Take care.

920
00:48:56.851 --> 00:48:57.851
You too.

921
00:49:12.476 --> 00:49:15.268
<i>I didn't learn to say goodbye</i>

922
00:49:16.726 --> 00:49:20.851
<i>I don't know if I
will ever get used to it</i>

923
00:49:21.351 --> 00:49:24.060
<i>Looking right into your eyes</i>

924
00:49:24.143 --> 00:49:26.185
<i>I know it will be engraved in mine</i>

925
00:49:26.268 --> 00:49:29.393
<i>The stare in your eyes</i>

926
00:49:30.268 --> 00:49:33.435
<i>I have nothing to say</i>

927
00:49:35.393 --> 00:49:36.643
What the fuck?

928
00:49:39.518 --> 00:49:41.893
Are you insane? 
What are you doing?

929
00:49:41.976 --> 00:49:43.310
You gave me a van.

930
00:49:43.393 --> 00:49:46.351
You promised me a trailer.
I want a trailer!


931
00:49:46.435 --> 00:49:47.976
Stop complaining!

932
00:49:48.060 --> 00:49:49.518
This is a piece of shit!

933
00:49:49.601 --> 00:49:52.393
I gave you what
I could. Just take it!

934
00:49:52.476 --> 00:49:56.143
You said you'd give me a trailer.
I want my trailer!


935
00:49:56.226 --> 00:49:58.226
-I won't!
-Yes, you will!


936
00:49:58.310 --> 00:50:00.226
-You're stupid!
-No, you are!


937
00:50:16.268 --> 00:50:18.893
Damn it!

938
00:50:19.393 --> 00:50:20.351
What the fuck?

939
00:50:22.351 --> 00:50:24.060
I can't believe it.

940
00:50:25.601 --> 00:50:26.476
Fuck!

941
00:50:43.101 --> 00:50:45.226
Change the station. 
This song sucks.

942
00:50:45.810 --> 00:50:46.976
I like it.

943
00:50:47.060 --> 00:50:48.768
I also liked my car.

944
00:50:48.851 --> 00:50:52.101
But I had to leave it behind
with a blown engine.


945
00:50:52.185 --> 00:50:53.685
You are so grumpy.

946
00:50:54.226 --> 00:50:55.143
My God, Clóvis.

947
00:50:55.226 --> 00:50:58.060
Let's celebrate
that our family is together again!


948
00:50:58.143 --> 00:51:00.726
What? I'm only here
because I need to be.

949
00:51:01.226 --> 00:51:05.935
You hung on to me like a disease,
a virus. I'll get rid of you soon.


950
00:51:06.018 --> 00:51:10.226
I'm having some technical difficulties.
Can someone hear me?


951
00:51:13.435 --> 00:51:14.393
I love this one!

952
00:51:15.393 --> 00:51:17.976
Man, this song is awesome.

953
00:51:18.060 --> 00:51:19.101
So good.

954
00:51:19.185 --> 00:51:21.601
This is a song for driving, for freedom.

955
00:51:21.685 --> 00:51:23.393
Feel the freedom.

956
00:51:23.476 --> 00:51:26.018
The cops are after me, remember?

957
00:51:26.893 --> 00:51:28.310
You're so pessimistic.

958
00:51:28.393 --> 00:51:29.851
It attracts negativity.

959
00:51:29.935 --> 00:51:32.560
You're too serious, too grumpy.

960
00:51:32.643 --> 00:51:34.518
You need to enjoy life.

961
00:51:35.185 --> 00:51:36.476
You want me to enjoy?

962
00:51:36.976 --> 00:51:38.310
Want me to live?

963
00:51:38.393 --> 00:51:40.018
-That's what you want?
-Yes.


964
00:51:40.101 --> 00:51:42.768
-Do you want freedom? Okay.
-Freedom.


965
00:51:46.310 --> 00:51:47.518
Freedom!

966
00:51:48.101 --> 00:51:49.935
Excitement!

967
00:51:51.976 --> 00:51:52.810
There you go.

968
00:51:53.393 --> 00:51:56.518
I felt nothing.
My life didn't change one bit.


969
00:51:56.601 --> 00:51:59.018
You didn't really mean it.

970
00:51:59.101 --> 00:52:01.768
You didn't let yourself
be completely free.


971
00:52:02.518 --> 00:52:03.685
Look at me.

972
00:52:03.768 --> 00:52:06.935
I'm totally lost,
sitting next to a criminal,


973
00:52:07.476 --> 00:52:10.601
but I'm here physically and spiritually.

974
00:52:11.851 --> 00:52:13.518
-You want me to let go?
-Yes.


975
00:52:13.601 --> 00:52:14.851
And live?

976
00:52:14.935 --> 00:52:16.935
All you do is criticize.

977
00:52:17.018 --> 00:52:20.185
It was just some advice.
You don't have to do it.


978
00:52:20.268 --> 00:52:23.851
If freedom is what you want,
freedom is what you'll get.


979
00:52:27.351 --> 00:52:30.268
<i>Tell people I'm here…</i>

980
00:52:30.351 --> 00:52:32.060
Set me free, DJ!

981
00:52:32.143 --> 00:52:35.351
<i>So take risks, kiss, make mistakes</i>

982
00:52:35.435 --> 00:52:37.810
<i>Love doesn't come with a warning sign</i>

983
00:52:37.893 --> 00:52:42.268
<i>Tell people I'm here</i>
<i>We only live once</i>


984
00:52:42.351 --> 00:52:44.726
Lohane!

985
00:52:45.518 --> 00:52:47.685
Lohane! Pay attention!

986
00:53:58.476 --> 00:53:59.435
I'm done!

987
00:53:59.518 --> 00:54:01.768
It's been hard to live like this!

988
00:54:01.851 --> 00:54:02.726
Very hard!

989
00:54:02.810 --> 00:54:05.726
After this incarnation,
spare me from coming back.


990
00:54:05.810 --> 00:54:08.393
There's nothing left for me to endure!

991
00:54:09.060 --> 00:54:09.893
Come on.

992
00:54:12.726 --> 00:54:14.268
I'm sorry, Clóvis.

993
00:54:15.726 --> 00:54:16.560
Fuck!

994
00:54:31.393 --> 00:54:33.226
Clóvis, I'm hungry.

995
00:54:33.768 --> 00:54:35.018
Aren't you?

996
00:54:37.018 --> 00:54:38.268
I'm talking to you.

997
00:54:38.976 --> 00:54:41.685
-Talk to my foot!
-Your foot reeks!


998
00:54:41.768 --> 00:54:42.935
Your past reeks.

999
00:54:43.643 --> 00:54:46.018
-It's the same as yours.
-Absolutely not.


1000
00:54:46.101 --> 00:54:48.435
I grew up, I evolved, I moved on.

1001
00:54:48.518 --> 00:54:51.226
My life went downhill because of you.

1002
00:54:51.310 --> 00:54:53.310
Clóvis, don't lie.

1003
00:54:53.393 --> 00:54:56.310
The cops were after you,
and I saved you, darling.


1004
00:54:56.393 --> 00:54:58.101
I brought joy to your life.

1005
00:54:58.185 --> 00:55:00.893
Turn that off.
I don't want to talk to you.


1006
00:55:00.976 --> 00:55:02.226
Talk to my foot.

1007
00:55:17.351 --> 00:55:19.810
Lohane.

1008
00:55:20.351 --> 00:55:22.351
-What is it?
-A mosquito.


1009
00:55:22.435 --> 00:55:25.268
-Leave it, man.
-I'm serious. I need it.


1010
00:55:25.351 --> 00:55:26.560
-For what?
-Eating.


1011
00:55:26.643 --> 00:55:28.018
-A mosquito?
-Stop!


1012
00:55:28.101 --> 00:55:29.018
Don't move.

1013
00:55:29.101 --> 00:55:30.643
I'm not moving, Clóvis.

1014
00:55:31.268 --> 00:55:34.018
I'm actually numb from starvation.

1015
00:55:34.101 --> 00:55:36.768
My stomach is eating itself.

1016
00:55:36.851 --> 00:55:40.893
If I put any food in my mouth,
it will disintegrate.


1017
00:55:41.518 --> 00:55:42.351
It landed.

1018
00:55:44.685 --> 00:55:46.435
What was that, Clóvis?

1019
00:55:47.143 --> 00:55:48.643
That's a crime.

1020
00:55:49.226 --> 00:55:51.851
That's domestic battery.

1021
00:55:51.935 --> 00:55:57.893
People do say assaults happen
in the family, at home!


1022
00:55:57.976 --> 00:55:59.226
What home, girl?

1023
00:55:59.310 --> 00:56:00.935
Is this a home? Since when?

1024
00:56:01.560 --> 00:56:03.101
We've hit rock bottom.

1025
00:56:03.185 --> 00:56:05.143
It's not about the trailer

1026
00:56:05.226 --> 00:56:07.101
or getting rich.

1027
00:56:07.185 --> 00:56:10.101
-No?
-No, it's the law of the jungle.


1028
00:56:10.185 --> 00:56:11.810
It's about survival.

1029
00:56:11.893 --> 00:56:13.560
It's about not starving.

1030
00:56:16.810 --> 00:56:18.143
Where are you going?

1031
00:56:18.226 --> 00:56:19.310
To look for food.

1032
00:56:19.393 --> 00:56:21.935
-And I'll be here, starving?
-I don't know!


1033
00:56:22.018 --> 00:56:25.351
I'm not your guardian.
I won't feed a couch potato.


1034
00:56:25.435 --> 00:56:27.018
I'm no such thing!

1035
00:56:27.101 --> 00:56:30.935
I have a business, Clóvis.
I'm a small business owner.


1036
00:56:31.018 --> 00:56:34.226
Small indeed, microscopic.
No one even knows it exists.


1037
00:56:34.310 --> 00:56:37.560
I don't wanna listen to you.
I don't care about you!


1038
00:56:37.643 --> 00:56:40.518
DJ, turn on the music! Hit it!

1039
00:56:45.060 --> 00:56:47.226
<i>People are scared</i>

1040
00:56:47.310 --> 00:56:50.351
<i>after two scammers arrived</i>
<i>in the Lakes Region</i>


1041
00:56:50.435 --> 00:56:52.310
<i>and started committing crimes.</i>

1042
00:56:52.393 --> 00:56:54.976
Clóvis! Come back here, hurry!

1043
00:56:55.060 --> 00:56:57.560
<i>They've already scammed a travel agency,</i>

1044
00:56:57.643 --> 00:57:00.935
<i>a bank and a luxury hotel</i>
<i>in Arraial do Cabo.</i>


1045
00:57:01.018 --> 00:57:02.310
-What is it?
-Listen.


1046
00:57:02.393 --> 00:57:05.851
<i>The city security cameras</i>

1048

<i>and the footage will help</i>
<i>the investigation.</i>


1049
00:57:12.935 --> 00:57:13.851
Clóvis!

1050
00:57:15.351 --> 00:57:17.310
We went too far.

1051
00:57:17.393 --> 00:57:19.643
We lost control, Clóvis!

1052
00:57:20.351 --> 00:57:22.185
Why didn't we study more?

1053
00:57:22.268 --> 00:57:24.351
I could've been a doctor, a lawyer.

1054
00:57:24.435 --> 00:57:27.726
I could be in a courthouse,
but look at me!


1055
00:57:31.185 --> 00:57:32.518
What did you say?

1056
00:57:37.435 --> 00:57:38.851
I wanted to be a doctor.

1057
00:57:42.060 --> 00:57:43.143
The problem is

1058
00:57:43.726 --> 00:57:46.601
between my current self
and my doctor self,


1059
00:57:46.685 --> 00:57:50.268
there's a medical school
that takes eight years.


1060
00:57:50.351 --> 00:57:53.226
What should help me get closer
to practicing medicine


1061
00:57:53.310 --> 00:57:54.893
is what keeps me away.

1062
00:57:54.976 --> 00:57:57.226
Life is so crazy.

1063
00:57:58.768 --> 00:57:59.768
So crazy.

1064
00:58:04.060 --> 00:58:05.976
I know how we'll get out of here.

1065
00:58:07.601 --> 00:58:09.935
UMBERTO MODIANO AIRPORT

DEPARTURES

1067
00:58:13.810 --> 00:58:17.601
-Emergency!
-It's a transplant, excuse us.


1068
00:58:17.685 --> 00:58:20.185
-It's an emergency.
-We have to board now.


1069
00:58:20.268 --> 00:58:22.976
-I wasn't informed.
-I'm informing you now.


1070
00:58:23.060 --> 00:58:26.476
There are specific logistics
for this procedure.


1071
00:58:29.018 --> 00:58:30.893
Do you know what the world needs?

1072
00:58:30.976 --> 00:58:33.143
A heart! What is in here? A heart!

1073
00:58:33.226 --> 00:58:36.560
A person is dying,
and you're wasting our time!


1074
00:58:36.643 --> 00:58:38.851
The Air Force does that, ma'am.

1075
00:58:38.935 --> 00:58:42.601
It transports politicians.
They don't even have a heart!


1076
00:58:42.685 --> 00:58:46.226
The Air Force sent us,
and you send us back to the Air Force?


1077
00:58:46.310 --> 00:58:47.351
What should I do?

1078
00:58:47.435 --> 00:58:49.476
Ask Santa Claus for a sleigh?

1079
00:58:49.560 --> 00:58:50.393
Is that so?

1080
00:58:50.476 --> 00:58:53.018
This is an outrage!
I can't board the plane!


1081
00:58:53.101 --> 00:58:55.726
-An outrage!
-An outrage!


1082
00:58:55.810 --> 00:58:58.810
Fine, the flight isn't full.

1083
00:58:58.893 --> 00:59:00.685
-Documents, please.
-Here.


1084
00:59:28.851 --> 00:59:31.018
I can't believe we did it!

1085
00:59:31.101 --> 00:59:35.018
Can you speak louder?
Do you want to get arrested now or later?


1086
00:59:35.101 --> 00:59:38.310
-What? I didn't do anything.
-Yes, now you're a saint.


1087
00:59:40.143 --> 00:59:42.060
-I'm going to the restroom.
-Go ahead.


1088
00:59:43.268 --> 00:59:46.768
-Stay here. I don't know this city.
-Fine.


1089
00:59:46.851 --> 00:59:50.643
If you leave me, they'll find me
in ten years with dreadlocks.


1090
00:59:50.726 --> 00:59:52.393
-A hobo.
-Hurry up, girl.


1091
00:59:54.393 --> 00:59:55.476
A vagrant!

1092
00:59:55.560 --> 00:59:56.643
Just go already!

1093
01:00:09.476 --> 01:00:10.310
Clóvis.

1094
01:00:11.601 --> 01:00:13.476
-You're under arrest.
-Shit.


1095
01:00:14.226 --> 01:00:15.060
Fuck.

1096
01:00:17.018 --> 01:00:20.393
Hurry up. What is taking so long?

1097
01:00:20.476 --> 01:00:24.060
They can't even arrest people efficiently
in this country.


1098
01:00:24.143 --> 01:00:25.393
Come on!

1099
01:00:31.726 --> 01:00:32.560
Clóvis?

1104
01:01:01.601 --> 01:01:03.601
You know you're done, right?

1105
01:01:04.935 --> 01:01:07.351
Based on your criminal record,

1106
01:01:07.435 --> 01:01:11.101
you will spend, I don't know,
about 20 years in prison.


1107
01:01:11.185 --> 01:01:14.018
-Let's talk it over.
-I won't talk to you.


1108
01:01:14.101 --> 01:01:15.601
Nunes, just take him.

1109
01:01:15.685 --> 01:01:17.810
If I help you, will you help me?

1110
01:01:17.893 --> 01:01:19.810
Help me? You can't even help yourself.

1111
01:01:19.893 --> 01:01:23.685
Tell me. Do you think
this guy has something to offer me?


1112
01:01:23.768 --> 01:01:24.643
Scumbag.

1113
01:01:26.643 --> 01:01:28.476
<i>Two hundred years ago</i>,

1114
01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:32.143
<i>an ensign got outraged</i>
<i>by the injustices of the Portuguese Crown</i>


1115
01:01:32.226 --> 01:01:34.268
<i>and fought for our freedom.</i>

1116
01:01:34.351 --> 01:01:36.893
<i>But his own accomplices turned him in.</i>

1117
01:01:36.976 --> 01:01:41.185
<i>He was hanged, quartered,</i>
<i>and his remains were publicly displayed.</i>


1118
01:01:41.768 --> 01:01:44.768
<i>The traitors were acquitted by the queen.</i>

1119
01:01:44.851 --> 01:01:47.643
<i>The title has gained</i>
<i>several synonyms since:</i>


1120
01:01:47.726 --> 01:01:51.101
<i>snitch, tattletale, narc,</i>
<i>whistle-blower, rat.</i>


1121
01:01:51.185 --> 01:01:53.560
<i>Recently, it received a much cooler one:</i>

1122
01:01:53.643 --> 01:01:56.351
Plea bargaining.

1123
01:01:58.768 --> 01:02:00.143
Let me talk to him.

1124
01:02:01.643 --> 01:02:03.393
It's trending.

1125
01:02:03.476 --> 01:02:05.060
Everybody's doing it.

1126
01:02:05.601 --> 01:02:07.851
I can't miss out on this.

1127
01:02:07.935 --> 01:02:10.143
Neither can you, right?

1128
01:02:12.226 --> 01:02:13.060
Spit it out.

1129
01:02:13.143 --> 01:02:15.560
I'll do it only if
I can get a pardon.

1130
01:02:16.435 --> 01:02:18.393
What are you talking about?

1131
01:02:18.476 --> 01:02:20.018
A Federal Senator.

1132
01:02:21.643 --> 01:02:22.560
Go on.

1133
01:02:22.643 --> 01:02:26.185
There's a money-laundering scheme
involving fake works of art.


1134
01:02:26.268 --> 01:02:29.518
I know about it because I'm involved,
the counterfeiter.


1135
01:02:29.601 --> 01:02:32.560
Nice to meet you.
I'm the artist, actually.


1136
01:02:32.643 --> 01:02:36.435
Who is always undermined,
unappreciated, who's paid less…


1137
01:02:36.518 --> 01:02:38.310
But let's not talk about that.

1138
01:02:38.851 --> 01:02:40.893
I am willing to cooperate,

1139
01:02:41.685 --> 01:02:45.226
and you can catch
not only a small fish like myself,


1140
01:02:46.268 --> 01:02:47.643
but a shark.

1141
01:02:48.601 --> 01:02:51.060
A shark! That's right.

1142
01:02:53.810 --> 01:02:55.060
-Nunes!
-What?


1143
01:02:55.810 --> 01:02:57.476
Have you ever eaten a shark?

1144
01:03:01.893 --> 01:03:05.351
Listen, you deadbeat,
the feds have joined the case.


1145
01:03:06.226 --> 01:03:07.060
You see?

1146
01:03:07.143 --> 01:03:10.601
Do you think this ankle bracelet
is just an accessory?


1147
01:03:11.185 --> 01:03:13.435
You are being monitored 24/7.

1148
01:03:14.018 --> 01:03:17.060
I promised to deliver
the Senator's head on a platter,


1149
01:03:17.143 --> 01:03:19.685
so don't think about screwing me over.

1150
01:03:19.768 --> 01:03:22.851
Relax, I won't do anything
behind your back.


1151
01:03:24.310 --> 01:03:25.226
One more thing.

1152
01:03:26.935 --> 01:03:29.143
If something goes wrong, you're done.

1153
01:03:29.226 --> 01:03:31.601
And not for 20
years, you'll be a lifer.

1154
01:03:32.518 --> 01:03:35.560
Everything will work out
just fine, deputy.


1155
01:03:35.643 --> 01:03:37.976
Think about your promotion.

1156
01:03:38.060 --> 01:03:39.893
Hey, take this.

1157
01:03:41.185 --> 01:03:44.060
I have a copy. One week.

1158
01:03:44.143 --> 01:03:46.018
That's all you got. One week.

1159
01:03:50.226 --> 01:03:52.226
Lohane? Where are you?

1160
01:04:00.435 --> 01:04:03.226
The check scam
is working here in São Paulo.


1161
01:04:03.310 --> 01:04:05.851
-I almost fell for it.
-I created a monster.


1162
01:04:05.935 --> 01:04:08.143
No, you didn't create a monster,

1163
01:04:08.226 --> 01:04:12.018
you gave birth to a monster
and left it in the gutter.


1164
01:04:12.101 --> 01:04:14.268
I told you not to leave me.

1165
01:04:14.351 --> 01:04:17.226
Luckily, I'm very charming.

1166
01:04:17.310 --> 01:04:18.685
Hi there!

1167
01:04:18.768 --> 01:04:20.268
Will you let me talk?

1168
01:04:20.393 --> 01:04:22.560
Clóvis, I'm not gonna be mad at you

1169
01:04:22.643 --> 01:04:25.518
only because I left
with nothing but my clothes,


1170
01:04:25.601 --> 01:04:28.435
and now I'm here, looking stunning,

1171
01:04:28.518 --> 01:04:30.976
in one of the biggest cities, São Paulo,

1172
01:04:31.060 --> 01:04:34.643
and I'm on the lookout
for better opportunities…


1173
01:04:35.851 --> 01:04:37.435
if you know what I mean.

1174
01:04:37.518 --> 01:04:38.851
Lohane, where are you?

1175
01:04:38.935 --> 01:04:40.018
<i>Where am I?</i>

1176
01:04:40.101 --> 01:04:42.601
I'm on Oscar.

1177
01:04:43.185 --> 01:04:44.726
Oscar Freire.

1178
01:04:45.310 --> 01:04:48.560
You were not delusional,
you're right. We're siblings.


1179
01:04:48.643 --> 01:04:50.143
Siblings fight, you know?

1180
01:04:50.226 --> 01:04:55.018
They get angry, argue,
say they won't speak to each other again.


1181
01:04:55.101 --> 01:04:57.810
-Thirty minutes later, it's all fine.
-Thirty?


1182
01:04:58.476 --> 01:05:01.518
I spent a hell of a night alone
in São Paulo.


1183
01:05:02.143 --> 01:05:04.351
-I saw terrible things.
-Listen.


1184
01:05:04.435 --> 01:05:08.268
I had to sort some things out
and find a place for us to stay.


1185
01:05:08.351 --> 01:05:12.351
And now I'm here to take you
to this apartment I got.


1186
01:05:12.435 --> 01:05:15.268
-You already did that?
-I have connections.


1187
01:05:15.351 --> 01:05:18.226
Now let's go,
because we really are siblings.


1188
01:05:18.310 --> 01:05:21.310
We are family,
and I have a proposition for you.


1189
01:05:21.393 --> 01:05:23.101
Proposition?

1190
01:05:23.185 --> 01:05:25.268
Our last scam together.

1191
01:05:25.351 --> 01:05:26.185
A big one.

1192
01:05:27.393 --> 01:05:29.060
I knew it, Clóvis.

1193
01:05:29.143 --> 01:05:34.101
When you talked about siblings and family,
I knew you were up to something.


1194
01:05:34.685 --> 01:05:36.268
Unfortunately, I can't.

1195
01:05:36.351 --> 01:05:39.893
I have an event
that cannot be postponed, my life!


1196
01:05:39.976 --> 01:05:41.643
I can't miss it.

1197
01:05:41.726 --> 01:05:46.518
If I survived 24 hours here without you,
I can survive the entire month.


1198
01:05:46.601 --> 01:05:48.018
It's not about survival,

1199
01:05:48.101 --> 01:05:51.768
I'm talking about something big.
A lot of money.


1200
01:05:52.726 --> 01:05:54.643
Impossible. How much?

1201
01:05:55.643 --> 01:05:58.726
You know that I've always liked to draw.

1202
01:06:02.185 --> 01:06:04.935
<i>Eventually I became a really good painter.</i>

1203
01:06:05.851 --> 01:06:09.393
<i>So good that</i>
<i>I counterfeited famous paintings.</i>


1204
01:06:10.185 --> 01:06:14.060
<i>I got in touch with a Senator</i>
<i>who liked to buy these paintings.</i>


1205
01:06:14.643 --> 01:06:18.435
<i>Then I sold him a fake painting</i>
<i>for really good money.</i>


1206
01:06:18.518 --> 01:06:22.476
<i>But that man broke into my apartment,</i>
<i>got all his money back,</i>


1207
01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:25.476
<i>and stole the money I made</i>
<i>selling the Christ.</i>


1208
01:06:26.435 --> 01:06:30.810
<i>That's why I was running away</i>
<i>the day you showed up and I ran over you.</i>


1209
01:06:32.643 --> 01:06:35.935
An art counterfeiter?

1210
01:06:36.018 --> 01:06:36.935
Yeah.

1211
01:06:37.018 --> 01:06:37.851
My God.

1212
01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:41.351
You never cease to amaze me.

1213
01:06:41.435 --> 01:06:43.810
We just need to
sell him a new painting.

1214
01:06:43.893 --> 01:06:44.976
And he pays well.

1215
01:06:45.060 --> 01:06:48.518
I'll do everything perfectly,
as I always do.


1216
01:06:48.601 --> 01:06:50.893
But he knows me,
he already screwed me over,


1217
01:06:50.976 --> 01:06:52.935
so I need a new
guy to talk to him.

1218
01:06:53.018 --> 01:06:56.101
Or a new girl. You, dear.

1219
01:06:56.185 --> 01:06:58.268
No. No way.

1220
01:06:58.893 --> 01:07:03.851
Listen, you want to do business
with the big shot who screwed you over?


1221
01:07:04.435 --> 01:07:07.101
What do you want me to do,
jump off a bridge?


1222
01:07:07.185 --> 01:07:09.351
Gargle with the Tietê River's water?
No way!


1223
01:07:09.435 --> 01:07:12.018
-What else do you want?
-It'll work this time.


1224
01:07:12.101 --> 01:07:15.185
You just need to sell the painting
and get the money.


1225
01:07:15.685 --> 01:07:17.060
Trust me on this.

1226
01:07:18.310 --> 01:07:20.101
It's the last scam, I promise.

1227
01:07:20.185 --> 01:07:21.893
We'll have a better life.

1228
01:07:22.685 --> 01:07:23.518
Trust me.

1229
01:07:25.393 --> 01:07:26.976
Will I get half of the money?

1230
01:07:27.060 --> 01:07:28.226
Of course!

1231
01:07:28.310 --> 01:07:31.560
You'll be able to buy
a brand-new trailer and much more.


1232
01:07:31.643 --> 01:07:36.226
No, you'll buy it with your share,
as promised.


1233
01:07:36.310 --> 01:07:40.393
You'll give me my share,
and then you'll buy a trailer with yours.


1234
01:07:41.185 --> 01:07:42.351
Such a smart-ass.

1235
01:07:42.435 --> 01:07:44.435
I had a good teacher.

1236
01:07:45.351 --> 01:07:46.351
Fine.

1237
01:07:48.768 --> 01:07:49.768
It's a deal.

1238
01:07:49.851 --> 01:07:50.976
<i>Abaporu.</i>

1239
01:07:51.060 --> 01:07:54.768
One of the most important paintings
in the history of art.


1240
01:07:54.851 --> 01:07:57.893
It was bought at an auction
for $2,5 million.


1241
01:07:57.976 --> 01:08:01.018
-More than six million reais.
-Too expensive.


1242
01:08:01.101 --> 01:08:03.851
-It's worth $30 million today.
-Damn! Thirty?


1243
01:08:03.935 --> 01:08:06.643
And my burgers are three bucks a pop.

1244
01:08:06.726 --> 01:08:08.893
It was painted by Tarsila do Amaral.

1245
01:08:08.976 --> 01:08:10.310
Tarsila? Who is she?

1246
01:08:10.393 --> 01:08:12.351
Tarsila was modern.

1247
01:08:12.435 --> 01:08:15.226
I think of myself as modern, too, Clóvis.

1248
01:08:15.310 --> 01:08:19.310
-She had a clean technique.
-I mastered that technique.


1249
01:08:19.393 --> 01:08:21.518
My bank account is all cleaned up.

1250
01:08:21.601 --> 01:08:24.601
Look, write down
she had a Brazilwood phase.


1251
01:08:24.685 --> 01:08:26.476
So lucky.

1252
01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:29.601
I've never gotten out of that phase.

1253
01:08:29.685 --> 01:08:34.226
I've been in that phase for ages,
I've never seen foreign wood.


1254
01:08:34.310 --> 01:08:35.476
Listen up.

1255
01:08:36.060 --> 01:08:37.601
You must be convincing.

1256
01:08:37.685 --> 01:08:38.643
-Okay.
-Okay?


1257
01:08:38.726 --> 01:08:40.768
I'll paint a Portinari now.

1258
01:08:42.310 --> 01:08:43.143
Who?

1259
01:08:44.018 --> 01:08:45.143
Girl…

1260
01:08:47.893 --> 01:08:51.351
Impressionism, expressionism,
cubism, and surrealism, go!


1261
01:08:51.435 --> 01:08:55.435
Impressionists paint
their impression of reality. It's boring.


1262
01:08:55.518 --> 01:08:58.851
Expressionists express
their suffering, their emotions.


1263
01:08:58.935 --> 01:09:02.476
They get drunk,
and their paintings are wonky. I like it.


1264
01:09:12.518 --> 01:09:14.268
What's wrong, Clóvis?

1265
01:09:14.351 --> 01:09:16.851
-Creative crisis.
-Economic crisis, you mean.


1266
01:09:16.935 --> 01:09:20.726
A person can't have a creative crisis
without a dime.


1267
01:09:20.810 --> 01:09:22.101
Paint anything!

1268
01:09:23.310 --> 01:09:25.768
I know. Want me to be your muse?

1269
01:09:27.726 --> 01:09:29.768
Cheap erotica? 
Are you insane?

1270
01:09:29.851 --> 01:09:32.601
My crisis will last forever.
Go study, Lohane.


1271
01:09:43.435 --> 01:09:46.476
Picasso: Spanish, cubist, millionaire.

1272
01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:49.893
Me: Brazilian, con artist, fucked up.

1273
01:09:55.768 --> 01:09:57.601
Amazing!

1274
01:09:59.226 --> 01:10:00.060
Horrible.

1275
01:10:03.976 --> 01:10:05.143
I'm not ready.

1276
01:10:05.226 --> 01:10:07.601
I'm mixing everything up. 
I'm desperate.

1277
01:10:07.685 --> 01:10:09.185
Just say what I told you.

1278
01:10:09.268 --> 01:10:13.393
That he's interested in pieces
of artistic and financial value,


1279
01:10:13.476 --> 01:10:15.476
and you have something he'll like.

1280
01:10:15.560 --> 01:10:17.310
I don't know what it is.

1281
01:10:17.393 --> 01:10:19.685
I've lied so much,
and now I'm being honest?


1282
01:10:19.768 --> 01:10:21.226
I feel sick.

1283
01:10:22.060 --> 01:10:23.060
Get me some water.

1284
01:10:25.935 --> 01:10:27.976
Taste is good, but money is money.

1285
01:10:28.060 --> 01:10:30.893
You might not like a Picasso
in your living room,


1286
01:10:30.976 --> 01:10:33.810
but you'll love a Picasso
in your bank account.


1287
01:10:34.976 --> 01:10:37.351
Yes, I'll send it. 
I'll send it now.

1288
01:10:37.435 --> 01:10:38.685
Just a minute.

1289
01:10:39.726 --> 01:10:40.601
Done.

1290
01:10:41.185 --> 01:10:42.435
But be discreet.

1291
01:10:42.935 --> 01:10:45.310
Pretend you received some nudes.

1292
01:10:46.060 --> 01:10:47.310
Which is also true

1293
01:10:47.393 --> 01:10:50.351
because the artist strips for the art.

1294
01:10:51.518 --> 01:10:55.685
I told you. It's amazing.

1295
01:10:55.768 --> 01:10:57.518
-Thirty thousand?
-A hundred.


1296
01:10:57.601 --> 01:11:00.643
No, I'm sorry. 
That's one installment.

1297
01:11:00.726 --> 01:11:03.685
We sell it for 100,
but I'll sell it to you for 90.


1298
01:11:04.226 --> 01:11:06.768
-Or no deal. Stand your ground.
-Or no deal.


1299
01:11:06.851 --> 01:11:08.143
Stand your ground.

1300
01:11:11.518 --> 01:11:12.351
So?

1301
01:11:16.060 --> 01:11:16.893
No deal.

1302
01:11:17.643 --> 01:11:18.768
Motherfucker.

1303
01:11:20.768 --> 01:11:24.351
I got rejected for something
I didn't even want, Clóvis.


1304
01:11:24.435 --> 01:11:26.935
It's all your fault. What now?

1305
01:11:32.060 --> 01:11:34.060
"Fifty grand and it's a deal."

1306
01:11:37.476 --> 01:11:38.435
Deal.

1307
01:11:53.143 --> 01:11:54.601
Can you hear me, Clóvis?

1308
01:11:54.685 --> 01:11:55.685
<i>Loud and clear.</i>

1309
01:11:55.768 --> 01:11:59.018
<i>Act naturally,</i>
<i>like you're an honest person.</i>


1310
01:11:59.101 --> 01:12:01.560
I don't know how. 
I was born dishonest.

1311
01:12:01.643 --> 01:12:04.685
Don't answer me!
They'll think you're crazy.


1312
01:12:05.268 --> 01:12:07.185
They already do.

1313
01:12:07.268 --> 01:12:10.351
I'm a medium. I'm here for your family.

1314
01:12:10.435 --> 01:12:14.518
The deceased just checked into Heaven.
Everything is fine.


1315
01:12:14.601 --> 01:12:16.226
Your energy is murky.

1316
01:12:16.310 --> 01:12:17.726
I'll pray for you.

1317
01:12:18.268 --> 01:12:19.185
God damn it!

1318
01:12:20.143 --> 01:12:21.643
Are you dead or alive?

1319
01:12:21.726 --> 01:12:23.560
The man coming, is he alive?

1320
01:12:23.643 --> 01:12:24.935
That's Fortunato.

1321
01:12:26.435 --> 01:12:28.268
-Jesus!
-Fortunato. Nice to meet you.


1322
01:12:28.351 --> 01:12:31.268
Don't do that,
we can't tell if you're alive.


1323
01:12:31.351 --> 01:12:32.393
You're like a ghost.

1324
01:12:32.476 --> 01:12:36.393
São Paulo was built
on top of an indigenous cemetery.


1325
01:12:36.476 --> 01:12:39.851
São Paulo is a double-decker cemetery.

1326
01:12:39.935 --> 01:12:41.976
The energy here is so murky.

1327
01:12:42.060 --> 01:12:44.643
I've got goosebumps. 
What the hell?

1328
01:12:44.726 --> 01:12:46.185
I'm here for the painting.

1329
01:12:46.268 --> 01:12:49.351
About that, I'm not the counterfeiter.

1330
01:12:49.435 --> 01:12:53.643
I'm a medium,
and I use spirituality to paint.


1331
01:12:53.726 --> 01:12:56.601
I don't use my hands.
It's a unique technique.


1332
01:12:56.685 --> 01:12:59.393
I paint with my
feet, and I go like…

1333
01:13:00.435 --> 01:13:02.310
You should see it.

1334
01:13:02.393 --> 01:13:04.768
I don't care if
you paint them or not.

1335
01:13:04.851 --> 01:13:07.435
I'm just here for the painting.
Where is it?


1336
01:13:07.518 --> 01:13:09.935
<i>-What was that, Lohane?</i>
-What?


1337
01:13:10.018 --> 01:13:11.143
-What?
-Yes.


1338
01:13:11.226 --> 01:13:13.851
Yes!

1339
01:13:13.935 --> 01:13:16.643
Too many people talking at the same time.

1340
01:13:16.726 --> 01:13:17.601
I apologize.

1341
01:13:17.685 --> 01:13:20.226
I have a great connection.
They're so close.


1342
01:13:20.310 --> 01:13:25.393
There are great artists buried here, okay?
They're talking to me.


1343
01:13:25.476 --> 01:13:29.768
They're very happy with our deal.
It's the deal of a lifetime, or death.


1344
01:13:31.185 --> 01:13:32.018
Just kidding.

1345
01:13:34.101 --> 01:13:36.143
Say there's something in your eye.

1346
01:13:36.226 --> 01:13:39.560
-What's going on here?
-Something got in my eyes.


1347
01:13:39.643 --> 01:13:42.310
My eyes! There's something in them.

1348
01:13:42.393 --> 01:13:46.560
-Why is that homeless man looking at us?
-What? Homeless man?


1349
01:13:46.643 --> 01:13:48.476
That one over there?

1350
01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:50.726
I didn't see him. 
He blended in.

1351
01:13:50.810 --> 01:13:53.060
Cemeteries have beggars.

1352
01:13:53.143 --> 01:13:54.893
It's the voodoo offerings.

1353
01:13:54.976 --> 01:13:57.851
They eat the offerings
since they have no food.


1354
01:13:57.935 --> 01:14:00.143
It's food for the saints. It's great.

1355
01:14:00.226 --> 01:14:03.268
Gumbo, stew. It's heavenly, delicious.

1356
01:14:03.810 --> 01:14:05.226
-Sorry.
-I'll ask again.


1357
01:14:05.310 --> 01:14:06.893
Do you know that homeless man?

1358
01:14:06.976 --> 01:14:09.393
How would I know him?

1359
01:14:09.476 --> 01:14:12.851
That's absurd!
Nobody knows a homeless man.


1360
01:14:12.935 --> 01:14:16.393
Who calls them up
and invites them to go have a drink?


1361
01:14:16.476 --> 01:14:19.601
No such thing.
Let's cut to the chase. Your Portinari.


1362
01:14:31.726 --> 01:14:33.018
<i>I told you it would work.</i>

1363
01:14:33.101 --> 01:14:35.768
We're a team. We're a duo!

1364
01:14:35.851 --> 01:14:37.601
Yes, we are a duo!

1365
01:14:40.810 --> 01:14:45.310
Hey, let's sing a duet.
No singing by ourselves.


1366
01:14:45.393 --> 01:14:47.518
You said we're a duo, so let's sing.

1367
01:14:47.601 --> 01:14:48.601
Which duo are we?

1368
01:14:49.310 --> 01:14:51.560
Sandy & Junior, obviously.
They're siblings, too.


1369
01:14:51.643 --> 01:14:52.810
I'm Sandy, then!

1370
01:14:54.476 --> 01:14:55.351
I said it first.

1371
01:14:55.435 --> 01:14:58.935
Of course not!
I'm Sandy, I'm a girl. You're Junior.


1372
01:14:59.018 --> 01:15:00.518
I don't wanna be Junior.

1373
01:15:00.601 --> 01:15:03.101
I don't have to. 
I don't relate with him.

1374
01:15:03.185 --> 01:15:05.101
I'm more like Sandy, you know?

1375
01:15:05.185 --> 01:15:07.226
I'll be Sandy, sorry.

1376
01:15:07.310 --> 01:15:10.976
It'll be Sandy and Sandy.
I won't be Junior 'cause you're Sandy.


1377
01:15:11.060 --> 01:15:13.143
All right, Sandy and Sandy.

1378
01:15:13.226 --> 01:15:15.768
We'll tell society
that we don't follow rules.


1379
01:15:15.851 --> 01:15:19.560
-We can do whatever we want.
-Great, let's get a drink, Sandy.


1380
01:15:28.226 --> 01:15:32.185
<i>I've decided to lay
my cards on the table</i>

1381
01:15:32.810 --> 01:15:36.685
<i>I decided to go after you</i>

1382
01:15:37.310 --> 01:15:40.935
<i>And show that I am crazy</i>

1383
01:15:41.935 --> 01:15:44.060
<i>For you</i>

1384
01:15:45.643 --> 01:15:47.310
<i>You better think</i>

1385
01:15:48.101 --> 01:15:50.101
<i>Of what you will say to me</i>

1386
01:15:51.726 --> 01:15:54.893
<i>I want someone to love me</i>

1387
01:15:54.976 --> 01:15:56.310
<i>You better think</i>

1388
01:15:57.185 --> 01:15:59.476
<i>Of what you will do</i>

1389
01:16:00.685 --> 01:16:03.893
<i>So that you won't hurt me</i>

1390
01:16:03.976 --> 01:16:06.018
<i>I will always love you</i>

1391
01:16:06.101 --> 01:16:09.435
<i>I'm stuck on you</i>
<i>And it's for real</i>


1392
01:16:11.226 --> 01:16:13.310
<i>I'm stuck on you</i>
<i>And it's for real</i>


1393
01:16:15.685 --> 01:16:18.060
<i>I'm stuck on you</i>
<i>And it's for real</i>


1394
01:16:19.726 --> 01:16:21.851
<i>Come to me</i>

1395
01:16:21.935 --> 01:16:25.018
<i>Let's be happy</i>

1396
01:17:06.393 --> 01:17:07.393
Clóvis?

1397
01:17:43.185 --> 01:17:44.351
Good afternoon.

1398
01:17:44.935 --> 01:17:50.143
Welcome to this beautiful event.
You make it beautiful.


1399
01:17:51.268 --> 01:17:54.851
I see we have distinguished people here
this afternoon,


1400
01:17:54.935 --> 01:17:58.393
but the star of the event

1401
01:17:58.476 --> 01:18:02.310
is a very rare piece painted by Portinari.

1402
01:18:02.393 --> 01:18:05.268
Let's take a look at it. Please.

1403
01:18:11.768 --> 01:18:15.268
What a beautiful painting.
I've got goosebumps.


1404
01:18:15.351 --> 01:18:18.810
It's been a while
since I've seen a Portinari so up close.


1405
01:18:20.393 --> 01:18:23.268
The owner of this rare piece of art

1406
01:18:23.351 --> 01:18:26.476
is an eminent personality in Brazil,

1407
01:18:27.226 --> 01:18:31.351
Senator Afonso Narcos,
who is here with us today.


1408
01:18:31.435 --> 01:18:33.060
Please, Senator, stand up.

1409
01:18:33.643 --> 01:18:35.518
Nice suit, Senator.

1410
01:18:36.018 --> 01:18:38.476
Thank you. You may sit down.

1411
01:18:38.560 --> 01:18:43.101
The initial bid for our masterpiece,

1412
01:18:43.185 --> 01:18:44.893
stipulated by our appraisers,

1413
01:18:44.976 --> 01:18:46.726
is 800,000 reais.

1414
01:18:47.351 --> 01:18:48.685
Anyone?

1415
01:18:50.060 --> 01:18:52.226
A million! Wonderful!

1416
01:18:52.310 --> 01:18:53.810
A million! Who bids more?

1417
01:18:54.726 --> 01:18:58.060
We have an enthusiast
over there, 1,2 million.


1418
01:18:58.143 --> 01:18:59.351
Who bids more?

1419
01:18:59.435 --> 01:19:01.643
1,4 million.

1420
01:19:01.726 --> 01:19:04.226
Get ready, Clóvis. It's time.

1421
01:19:04.310 --> 01:19:06.351
-Fill my glass.
-Ask another waiter.


1422
01:19:07.435 --> 01:19:08.768
Now, Clóvis.

1423
01:19:11.851 --> 01:19:12.685
Lohane, no!

1424
01:19:13.268 --> 01:19:14.518
What are you doing here?

1425
01:19:14.601 --> 01:19:16.935
-What are you doing here?
<i>-Going once…</i>


1426
01:19:17.018 --> 01:19:18.435
How did you get here?

1427
01:19:18.518 --> 01:19:19.935
I followed you.

1428
01:19:20.018 --> 01:19:23.643
Go away. Trust me, it's for the best.

1429
01:19:26.018 --> 01:19:27.851
Trust you, Clóvis?

1430
01:19:29.101 --> 01:19:30.310
What are you hiding?

1431
01:19:30.810 --> 01:19:34.018
I'm hiding you from the cops. Go away.

1432
01:19:34.685 --> 01:19:35.601
Excuse me.

1433
01:19:36.185 --> 01:19:39.768
Who bids more? 2,3 million over there.

1434
01:19:39.851 --> 01:19:41.018
Anyone?

1435
01:19:42.226 --> 01:19:45.143
2,6 million reais.

1436
01:19:45.226 --> 01:19:47.435
Anyone? 2,8 million.

1437
01:19:47.518 --> 01:19:49.310
It's a very close race.

1438
01:19:49.393 --> 01:19:50.560
Who bids more?

1439
01:19:50.643 --> 01:19:52.560
Three million over here!

1440
01:19:53.060 --> 01:19:56.060
The guy who bought it from me
is buying it again?


1441
01:19:56.143 --> 01:19:57.393
What are you up to?

1442
01:19:57.476 --> 01:20:02.185
Sold to the gentleman here.
Congratulations.


1443
01:20:03.060 --> 01:20:04.726
Let's hear it for him.

1444
01:20:04.810 --> 01:20:07.101
I can't explain now. Go away!

1445
01:20:07.185 --> 01:20:09.518
Not until you explain everything.

1446
01:20:09.601 --> 01:20:11.435
You're getting in my way. Go!

1447
01:20:12.018 --> 01:20:13.935
Stop!

1448
01:20:14.018 --> 01:20:15.435
Just for a minute.

1449
01:20:15.518 --> 01:20:17.226
I have something for you.

1450
01:20:17.310 --> 01:20:20.393
Why is a waiter interrupting the auction?

1451
01:20:20.476 --> 01:20:23.310
And some people say
people don't appreciate art.


1452
01:20:23.393 --> 01:20:27.976
Do you plan on bidding?
Did you sign up for the event?


1453
01:20:28.060 --> 01:20:29.560
I'm not here for that.

1454
01:20:29.643 --> 01:20:31.435
I'm here to make an offer.

1455
01:20:31.518 --> 01:20:36.018
If this painting is worth three million,
then tell me something.


1456
01:20:37.768 --> 01:20:39.601
How much is this one worth?

1457
01:20:40.976 --> 01:20:43.351
What? A fake replica?

1458
01:20:44.060 --> 01:20:47.101
Which one? Mine or the Senator's?

1459
01:20:47.185 --> 01:20:48.768
Or both?

1460
01:20:48.851 --> 01:20:50.268
Which one is faker?

1461
01:20:51.226 --> 01:20:54.851
-Arrest him, deputy.
-He is insane! Security!


1462
01:20:54.935 --> 01:20:58.060
Attention, everyone. 
The auction is over!

1463
01:20:59.976 --> 01:21:01.018
What?

1464
01:21:01.101 --> 01:21:02.060
What's going on?

1465
01:21:02.143 --> 01:21:04.935
Please leave
in a calm and organized manner.


1466
01:21:05.018 --> 01:21:06.643
I'll get your statements.

1467
01:21:07.185 --> 01:21:09.393
Not you, Senator. 
Wait a minute.

1468
01:21:09.476 --> 01:21:11.143
Wait a minute, yeah.

1469
01:21:11.226 --> 01:21:12.560
Stop right there.

1470
01:21:12.643 --> 01:21:14.893
Senator, I'm the police chief.

1471
01:21:15.393 --> 01:21:16.851
I apologize, sir,

1472
01:21:17.518 --> 01:21:21.268
but I've received a tip
about a money laundering scheme


1473
01:21:21.351 --> 01:21:23.060
involving your painting.

1474
01:21:23.143 --> 01:21:24.893
Not that it means you're involved,

1475
01:21:24.976 --> 01:21:28.060
but there is evidence
that this painting is fake.


1476
01:21:28.810 --> 01:21:32.185
Deputy, I am a federal senator.

1477
01:21:32.268 --> 01:21:34.185
I have jurisdiction privileges.

1478
01:21:34.268 --> 01:21:35.768
-Really?
-Don't worry.


1479
01:21:35.851 --> 01:21:39.268
I will do everything I can
to clarify this situation.


1480
01:21:40.143 --> 01:21:41.310
Allow me.

1481
01:21:41.393 --> 01:21:43.768
He paid 50 thousand for the painting,

1482
01:21:43.851 --> 01:21:46.643
so he would get
three million for it legally.


1483
01:21:46.726 --> 01:21:51.143
Dirty money of unknown provenance
would get into his account legally.


1484
01:21:51.226 --> 01:21:55.935
Deputy, please,
you can speak to my lawyers.


1485
01:21:56.643 --> 01:21:59.393
-I trust the justice system.
-You won't arrest him?


1486
01:21:59.476 --> 01:22:01.601
-Arrest him! I'll do it, then.
-No!


1487
01:22:01.685 --> 01:22:04.351
-You're hurting me!
-I'll make a citizen's arrest!


1488
01:22:04.435 --> 01:22:06.143
-Arrest him, dude!
-Chief.


1489
01:22:06.226 --> 01:22:07.726
What's going on, Clóvis?

1490
01:22:07.810 --> 01:22:09.018
No, not her.

1491
01:22:09.101 --> 01:22:11.268
The Senator gets to walk, but she doesn't?

1492
01:22:11.351 --> 01:22:12.935
It is what it is.

1493
01:22:13.018 --> 01:22:17.268
You promised a money-laundering scheme
with fake paintings and a senator.


1494
01:22:17.351 --> 01:22:19.435
Senators are untouchable. Who's left?

1495
01:22:19.518 --> 01:22:21.476
The counterfeiter and the receiver.

1496
01:22:21.560 --> 01:22:25.351
Don't you know
that the weakest always goes to the wall?


1497
01:22:26.935 --> 01:22:29.560
-That wasn't the deal!
-I made a deal with you.


1498
01:22:29.643 --> 01:22:31.726
You brought her into it.

1499
01:22:31.810 --> 01:22:34.518
If you had told me the truth,
I would've helped.


1500
01:22:34.601 --> 01:22:36.435
I can't go back empty-handed.

1501
01:22:36.518 --> 01:22:39.768
I need to think about my promotion.

1502
01:22:39.851 --> 01:22:40.851
Right?

1503
01:22:42.310 --> 01:22:43.185
Take her.

1504
01:22:43.268 --> 01:22:45.310
She's a decent person.

1505
01:22:45.393 --> 01:22:47.101
She works. She has a trailer.

1506
01:22:47.185 --> 01:22:48.018
I do.

1507
01:22:48.101 --> 01:22:50.768
She is a fighter. 
I made her do it.

1508
01:22:50.851 --> 01:22:54.018
You said it was all
set and good to go.

1509
01:22:54.101 --> 01:22:56.226
I told you I'm a liability.

1510
01:23:00.060 --> 01:23:04.226
You can use it all against me,
but let her go.


1511
01:23:04.310 --> 01:23:07.810
Take me away from society and mankind…

1512
01:23:09.935 --> 01:23:12.268
but don't take the only person I love.

1513
01:23:16.601 --> 01:23:20.185
What is this, a
soap opera? What are you?

1514
01:23:21.185 --> 01:23:22.601
-Siblings.
-Siblings.


1515
01:23:47.726 --> 01:23:52.435
18 MONTHS LATER

1516
01:23:56.976 --> 01:23:59.226
<i>I served my time, all right?</i>

1517
01:23:59.310 --> 01:24:01.268
<i>The court, on the other hand,</i>

1518
01:24:01.351 --> 01:24:05.726
<i>sentenced me to eight years in prison,</i>
<i>but gradually reduced my sentence.</i>


1519
01:24:06.268 --> 01:24:10.851
<i>It was initially reduced for helping</i>
<i>to solve the crime I committed myself.</i>


1520
01:24:10.935 --> 01:24:12.935
<i>Then, it was reduced even more.</i>

1521
01:24:13.018 --> 01:24:15.101
<i>There were so many appeals,</i>

1522
01:24:15.185 --> 01:24:18.643
<i>that I think I was released</i>
<i>with some credits with the law.</i>


1523
01:24:19.435 --> 01:24:22.060
<i>And if you think my sentence was short,</i>

1524
01:24:22.143 --> 01:24:24.185
<i>even with all the evidence,</i>

1525
01:24:24.268 --> 01:24:26.476
<i>the Senator got away with everything.</i>

1526
01:24:34.893 --> 01:24:36.310
I can't believe it!

1527
01:24:41.435 --> 01:24:44.143
GET THE GRIFT

1528
01:24:53.226 --> 01:24:54.101
Here you go.

1529
01:24:54.185 --> 01:24:58.185
The Double Scam comes with two burgers,
cheese, lettuce and tomato.


1530
01:24:58.268 --> 01:25:02.393
The Jailbird comes with a chicken patty
and our special sauce.


1531
01:25:02.476 --> 01:25:04.768
The Vegan Fraud tastes like meat,

1532
01:25:04.851 --> 01:25:07.143
but it's eggplant with barbecue sauce.

1533
01:25:07.226 --> 01:25:09.893
And the Crooks' 
Salad is made with tofu.

1534
01:25:09.976 --> 01:25:11.726
-I don't like it.
-I do.


1535
01:25:11.810 --> 01:25:12.976
-Really?
-Sure.


1536
01:25:13.060 --> 01:25:14.351
-Make that two.
-Two?


1537
01:25:14.435 --> 01:25:16.851
Two Crooks' Salads, Lohane!

1538
01:25:16.935 --> 01:25:18.351
Coming right up!

1539
01:25:23.685 --> 01:25:26.226
Now this is a good napkin! It's great!

1540
01:25:26.310 --> 01:25:30.018
I'm proud to serve
good products to my clients.


1541
01:25:30.101 --> 01:25:32.226
Here we have barbecue and mayo.

1542
01:25:32.310 --> 01:25:34.185
Real mayo. It's to die for.

1543
01:25:34.268 --> 01:25:35.435
-Enjoy!
-Thank you.


1544
01:25:35.518 --> 01:25:38.101
Crooks' Salad never made anybody sick.

1545
01:25:38.185 --> 01:25:40.226
Some things are way worse.

1546
01:25:40.310 --> 01:25:42.310
Don't be lazy, Clóvis!

1547
01:25:42.393 --> 01:25:43.893
Get back to work, honey!

1548
01:25:44.601 --> 01:25:47.143
-We gotta pay the bills.
-But I am working!


1549
01:25:47.226 --> 01:25:49.518
Can't you see that? I am working.

1550
01:25:49.601 --> 01:25:53.518
Would you like anything else?
See, I'm working.


1551
01:25:54.893 --> 01:25:56.726
Go make your sandwiches.

1552
01:26:05.810 --> 01:26:08.101
Write down that she had
a Brazilwood phase.


1553
01:26:15.601 --> 01:26:17.060
Unbelievable.

1554
01:26:17.143 --> 01:26:21.060
Impressionists paint
their impression of reality, of beauty.


1555
01:26:23.976 --> 01:26:25.685
-It's boring.
-It's boring.


1556
01:26:25.768 --> 01:26:26.976
Did you come out?

1557
01:26:27.768 --> 01:26:28.935
Are you out yet?

1558
01:26:36.560 --> 01:26:40.768
Cheese-Lohane, Chicken-Lohane,
Lohane-Salad and Ho--


1559
01:26:41.810 --> 01:26:43.393
"Holane!"

1560
01:26:43.935 --> 01:26:45.310
Start from the top.

1561
01:26:45.393 --> 01:26:46.226
Try again.

1562
01:26:47.143 --> 01:26:49.851
Yes, I don't have a permit,
I can't sell food,


1563
01:26:49.935 --> 01:26:52.726
but you can't, you can't…

1564
01:26:54.893 --> 01:26:56.726
-Wait!
-Let's go back now!


1565
01:26:56.810 --> 01:26:58.810
-This party is great!
-It sucks!


1566
01:26:58.893 --> 01:27:00.226
Wait, dude!

1567
01:27:00.310 --> 01:27:02.518
Let me go. Why are we leaving?

1568
01:27:02.601 --> 01:27:03.685
Let's go back!

1569
01:27:03.768 --> 01:27:05.518
-Wait, stay here with me.
-Let go.


1570
01:27:05.601 --> 01:27:09.601
-Let go of my arm!
-I won't!


1571
01:27:10.726 --> 01:27:11.810
Let's go to sleep.

1572
01:27:26.643 --> 01:27:27.726
I'm trying.

1573
01:27:30.685 --> 01:27:32.601
The Air Force sent us here,

1574
01:27:32.685 --> 01:27:35.226
and you send us
back to the Air Force?

1575
01:27:35.310 --> 01:27:36.685
What should we do?

1576
01:27:39.226 --> 01:27:42.976
-You serve fake mayonnaise…
-Be careful!


1577
01:27:44.685 --> 01:27:45.601
It's loose.

1578
01:27:45.685 --> 01:27:47.685
For God's sake, don't do that.

1579
01:27:53.226 --> 01:27:54.643
I wanted to be a doctor.

1580
01:27:56.810 --> 01:27:57.893
The problem is

1581
01:27:58.560 --> 01:28:01.601
between my current self
and my doctor self is…


1582
01:28:02.435 --> 01:28:03.435
Sorry.

1583
01:28:10.435 --> 01:28:13.518
-Make that two.
-Two? Two Salad…


1584
01:28:18.976 --> 01:28:19.810
Bye!

1585
01:28:20.310 --> 01:28:21.560
You dropped your mic.

1586
01:28:25.351 --> 01:28:28.810
And listen, if I survival…

1587
01:28:31.060 --> 01:28:33.185
-If I "survival."
-If I "survival."


1588
01:28:33.268 --> 01:28:36.435
Our last scam together, a big one.

1589
01:28:36.518 --> 01:28:38.101
I knew it, you know?

1590
01:28:38.643 --> 01:28:40.268
I knew it…

1591
01:28:42.685 --> 01:28:45.185
I knew it, you know?
