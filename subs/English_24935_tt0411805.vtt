THE COMPUTER SYSTEM


173
00:12:35.263 --> 00:12:38.399
AND MAKING IT ALL HAPPEN
LIKE YOU USUALLY DO?


174

WHERE YOU GOING?

178
00:12:46.307 --> 00:12:47.708
WHAT'S WRONG, MAN?

179
00:12:47.741 --> 00:12:49.210

180
00:12:49.243 --> 00:12:51.345

181
00:12:51.645 --> 00:12:54.682
AND WITH THAT SAID,
WHEN THE LITTLE MICE

DEEMED ACCEPTABLE, SUCH AS ENTER


183
00:12:58.386 --> 00:13:01.255
AN AREA OF THE MAZE
THAT WE WANT THEM TO GO IN,

POSITIVE REINFORCEMENT,


185

YOU WORK AT HYBRA TECH,
DON'T YOU?


192
00:13:18.906 --> 00:13:21.309
I BET YOU SEE
ALL SORTS OF EXAMPLES


193
00:13:21.342 --> 00:13:23.211
OF THIS SCIENTIFIC PROCESS.

194

WELL, ACTUALLY, I WORK
IN THE MONITORING STATION,

IN SECURITY.

196
00:13:29.983 --> 00:13:32.786
HYBRA TECH
IS A CLASSIC EXAMPLE


197
00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:36.224
OF A COMPANY WHOSE DIVERSE LINE
OF GOODS AND SERVICES


198
00:13:36.257 --> 00:13:40.261
CONSTANTLY UTILIZES THE
SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERY PROCESS.


199
00:13:40.294 --> 00:13:42.530
THEY CREATE ALMOST EVERYTHING,

200
00:13:42.563 --> 00:13:44.832
FROM PROCESSED CHEESE
TO NAPALM.


201
00:13:44.865 --> 00:13:49.670
A VERY UNFORTUNATE PART OF THE
SCIENTIFIC PROCESS IS FAILURE.


202
00:13:49.703 --> 00:13:50.771
IN SIMPLE TERMS,

203
00:13:50.804 --> 00:13:54.908
YOU CANNOT MAKE AN OMELET
WITHOUT BREAKING A FEW EGGS.


204
00:13:56.009 --> 00:13:57.678
HEY, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

00:14:01.449 --> 00:14:03.884
JULIAN'S PARENTS WERE

208
00:14:03.917 --> 00:14:06.420

209
00:14:06.454 --> 00:14:09.257

THEY'VE BEEN ON MY MIND
A LOT LATELY.


215
00:14:21.669 --> 00:14:24.438
IT'S BEEN REALLY HARD
ON MY BROTHER, TOO.
