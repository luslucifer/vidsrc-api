00:01:14.769 --> 00:01:16.438
Hey, guys, it's Casey.

2
00:01:18.773 --> 00:01:20.040
Hey, guys, Casey here.

3
00:01:22.444 --> 00:01:26.980
Today I'm gonna be taking
the world's fair challenge.


4
00:03:29.837 --> 00:03:31.739
Hey guys, Casey here.

5
00:03:31.773 --> 00:03:33.073
Welcome to my channel.

6
00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.949
Today, I'm going to be taking
the world's fair challenge.


7
00:03:42.617 --> 00:03:44.452
This is Poe.

8
00:03:44.485 --> 00:03:46.854
He's going to be taking the
challenge with us today.


9
00:03:53.761 --> 00:03:55.262
I don't know what to expect.

10
00:04:10.277 --> 00:04:11.277
Okay.

11
00:04:14.382 --> 00:04:15.717
All right, let's get started.

12
00:04:29.731 --> 00:04:31.466
I want to go to
the world's fair.


13
00:04:36.336 --> 00:04:37.872
I want to go to
the world's fair.


14
00:04:41.809 --> 00:04:43.611
I want to go to
the world's fair.


15
00:04:50.418 --> 00:04:51.418
Okay.

16
00:05:49.276 --> 00:05:50.276
Okay.

17
00:05:56.984 --> 00:05:57.984
Okay, now,

18
00:06:02.056 --> 00:06:03.391
now the video.

19
00:07:42.089 --> 00:07:44.357
Okay, that was the
world's fair challenge.


20
00:07:45.393 --> 00:07:46.494
Thanks for watching.

21
00:07:47.628 --> 00:07:48.963
And I'll make sure to update

22
00:07:48.996 --> 00:07:50.431
if I start to
notice any changes.


23
00:10:48.209 --> 00:10:49.209
I think,

24
00:10:51.712 --> 00:10:53.514
I think I'm turning
into something,


25
00:10:54.782 --> 00:10:55.950
something terrible.

26
00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:04.291
So you want to join

27
00:11:04.325 --> 00:11:07.928
the internet's scariest
online horror game?


28
00:11:09.597 --> 00:11:10.765
Well okay.

29
00:11:10.798 --> 00:11:12.933
But just remember,

30
00:11:12.967 --> 00:11:15.002
we can't be held responsible

31
00:11:15.036 --> 00:11:16.904
for what you become.

32
00:11:16.937 --> 00:11:18.773
All you have to
do to get started


33
00:11:18.806 --> 00:11:20.574
is take the challenge

34
00:11:21.909 --> 00:11:24.578
and then you begin
reporting your symptoms.


35
00:11:24.612 --> 00:11:27.948
If other players like the
direction you're taking the story,


36
00:11:27.982 --> 00:11:32.186
they'll help you
expand it further.


37
00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:11.192
Small green brick

38
00:12:14.195 --> 00:12:15.195
dropping

39
00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:18.232
from my throat to my stomach,

40
00:12:20.935 --> 00:12:21.935
and then another.

41
00:12:24.972 --> 00:12:27.007
Orange this time.

42
00:12:27.041 --> 00:12:30.344
And shaped like an I.

43
00:12:35.015 --> 00:12:37.351
It took me a while to realize

44
00:12:39.186 --> 00:12:40.621
this is Tetris.

45
00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:44.258
I'm playing Tetris.

46
00:12:46.026 --> 00:12:47.862
Now it's all I'm doing.

47
00:12:50.965 --> 00:12:52.867
They're up to here now.

48
00:12:57.071 --> 00:12:58.873
They're getting closer

49
00:13:00.174 --> 00:13:01.175
to my neck.

50
00:15:49.977 --> 00:15:52.279
It's three o'clock
in the fucking morning.


51
00:15:54.649 --> 00:15:55.649
Sorry.

52
00:17:04.118 --> 00:17:05.420
Hey guys.

53
00:17:05.453 --> 00:17:08.590
So, I took the
world's fair challenge


54
00:17:08.623 --> 00:17:11.959
because I love horror movies and

55
00:17:11.992 --> 00:17:15.363
I thought it might be cool to
try actually living in one.


56
00:17:16.731 --> 00:17:19.266
I used to sleep walk
a lot as a little kid


57
00:17:19.299 --> 00:17:22.069
and I would tell myself these
scary stories in my head


58
00:17:22.102 --> 00:17:24.938
so I could fall asleep for once.

59
00:17:24.972 --> 00:17:27.040
And when I'd tell myself
these scary stories,


60
00:17:27.074 --> 00:17:28.552
usually when I'd
fall asleep at night,


61
00:17:28.576 --> 00:17:30.412
I'd have these crazy dreams.

62
00:17:30.445 --> 00:17:33.180
And I swear in my head it
was like Paranormal Activity.


63
00:17:33.213 --> 00:17:35.015
Like I'm not even
lying with you.


64
00:17:35.048 --> 00:17:37.452
Like it was like I was walking

65
00:17:37.485 --> 00:17:39.953
around the house possessed
by some evil spirit.


66
00:17:41.456 --> 00:17:43.357
It's funny, I'd be dreaming.

67
00:17:43.391 --> 00:17:46.193
I know I'd be dreaming
when it used to happen


68
00:17:46.226 --> 00:17:48.630
but it was like I was also
awake at the same time.


69
00:17:51.633 --> 00:17:53.200
It was like watching
myself on a TV


70
00:17:53.233 --> 00:17:54.502
all the way across the room.

71
00:17:54.536 --> 00:17:57.304
And I was aware of my actions.

72
00:17:57.337 --> 00:17:58.573
Yes, granted I was aware,

73
00:17:58.606 --> 00:18:00.207
but I couldn't control myself.

74
00:18:03.076 --> 00:18:04.422
I've been kind of
feeling that way recently


75
00:18:04.446 --> 00:18:06.180
ever since I watched that video.

76
00:18:06.213 --> 00:18:09.082
That feeling's kind of
creeping up on me a little bit.


77
00:18:09.116 --> 00:18:10.594
I'm not really sure
what to do about it.


78
00:18:10.618 --> 00:18:12.487
I was kind of used to
not having to stress


79
00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:14.288
about every single
time I fell asleep


80
00:18:14.321 --> 00:18:15.523
that I'd do something crazy

81
00:18:15.557 --> 00:18:18.693
or like get run over by a car,

82
00:18:18.726 --> 00:18:21.596
just like standing
in front of the car.


83
00:18:23.398 --> 00:18:24.399
Cause I tell you if, if-

84
00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:27.502
I might be aware
that a car is coming,


85
00:18:27.535 --> 00:18:29.036
but I would just stay there.

86
00:18:32.607 --> 00:18:34.208
My whole body's numb.

87
00:18:34.241 --> 00:18:35.352
I know it should
be cold right now


88
00:18:35.376 --> 00:18:36.416
but I don't feel anything.

89
00:18:44.117 --> 00:18:45.986
Okie dokie artichokie.

90
00:20:00.395 --> 00:20:02.564
I'm going to record
myself sleeping tonight.


91
00:20:51.446 --> 00:20:52.847
This is so stupid.

92
00:21:02.289 --> 00:21:04.358
Who wants to watch dumb videos?

93
00:26:15.670 --> 00:26:16.670
Hey.

94
00:26:17.805 --> 00:26:18.805
Shh.

95
00:26:20.007 --> 00:26:21.175
Shh.

96
00:26:21.208 --> 00:26:22.209
You're okay.

97
00:26:23.911 --> 00:26:24.911
Shh.

98
00:26:26.047 --> 00:26:27.448
Did you have a bad dream?

99
00:26:30.685 --> 00:26:31.685
Yeah.

100
00:26:32.286 --> 00:26:33.487
Those are hard.

101
00:26:34.655 --> 00:26:36.691
Sorry you had a bad dream.

102
00:26:38.859 --> 00:26:40.194
Shh, shh, shh.

103
00:26:40.227 --> 00:26:41.228
It's okay.

104
00:26:41.262 --> 00:26:42.964
You're fine now.

105
00:26:42.997 --> 00:26:44.565
It's okay.

106
00:26:44.598 --> 00:26:45.566
I know it takes a while
to come out of the,


107
00:26:45.599 --> 00:26:47.234
out of the nightmare.

108
00:26:47.268 --> 00:26:48.669
Sometimes it feels,

109
00:26:52.206 --> 00:26:53.574
sometimes it still feels real

110
00:26:53.607 --> 00:26:55.009
even when you're awake.

111
00:26:57.244 --> 00:26:59.113
It's all okay now.

112
00:26:59.146 --> 00:27:01.082
It's all okay.

113
00:27:01.115 --> 00:27:01.983
You're okay now.

114
00:27:02.016 --> 00:27:03.851
I'm right here.

115
00:27:05.152 --> 00:27:06.554
I'm right here.

116
00:27:06.587 --> 00:27:08.522
You can go back to bed.

117
00:27:09.824 --> 00:27:10.824
Go to bed.

118
00:27:12.593 --> 00:27:13.794
Go back to bed.

119
00:27:15.062 --> 00:27:16.062
Shh.

120
00:27:17.598 --> 00:27:19.667
Close your eyes.

121
00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:24.672
Close your eyes.

122
00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:27.742
Close your eyes, close your eyes

123
00:27:29.010 --> 00:27:30.144
and go to bed.

124
00:27:31.345 --> 00:27:34.148
Close your eyes,
close your eyes.


125
00:27:34.181 --> 00:27:35.549
Shh, shh, shh.

126
00:27:35.583 --> 00:27:37.184
Close your eyes, shh.

127
00:27:38.152 --> 00:27:39.620
Close your eyes.

128
00:27:43.758 --> 00:27:46.694
You can go back to bed.

129
00:27:46.727 --> 00:27:49.563
Shh, shh, shh.

130
00:27:49.597 --> 00:27:53.300
You can go back to bed now.

131
00:27:53.334 --> 00:27:54.334
Shh.

132
00:27:57.071 --> 00:27:58.072
You're okay.

133
00:28:00.007 --> 00:28:01.242
You're okay, you're okay now.

134
00:28:01.275 --> 00:28:02.610
Shh, shh, shh.

135
00:28:08.115 --> 00:28:09.984
Shh, shh, you're okay.

136
00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:14.989
You're okay, you're okay.

137
00:28:17.892 --> 00:28:19.293
Have sweet dreams.

138
00:28:21.128 --> 00:28:22.730
Have sweet dreams.

139
00:28:26.133 --> 00:28:29.203
Sweet, sweet,
sweet, sweet dreams.


140
00:28:29.236 --> 00:28:31.238
Have good, sweet dreams.

141
00:28:34.376 --> 00:28:36.177
Dream of good things.

142
00:28:37.845 --> 00:28:38.979
Dream of nice,

143
00:28:40.014 --> 00:28:42.149
warm wonderful things.

144
00:28:44.386 --> 00:28:46.754
You're safe.

145
00:28:46.787 --> 00:28:49.790
You're safe and
comfortable with me.


146
00:28:49.824 --> 00:28:50.825
You're okay.

147
00:28:51.725 --> 00:28:52.860
Shh, shh, shh.

148
00:28:54.662 --> 00:28:55.796
Shh, shh, shh.

149
00:28:57.131 --> 00:28:58.232
It's okay.

150
00:28:58.265 --> 00:28:59.265
It's okay.

151
00:29:00.935 --> 00:29:02.736
It's okay, it's okay.

152
00:29:05.239 --> 00:29:07.041
It's okay, it's okay.

153
00:29:10.344 --> 00:29:12.279
You're okay now.

154
00:29:12.313 --> 00:29:13.314
You're okay.

155
00:29:14.281 --> 00:29:15.683
Go back to bed.

156
00:31:29.417 --> 00:31:30.385
Hi guys.

157
00:31:30.418 --> 00:31:32.286
I'm JLB,

158
00:31:32.319 --> 00:31:36.056
and this channel is for my
latest world's fair stories,


159
00:31:36.090 --> 00:31:38.092
drawing and fan theories.

160
00:31:41.228 --> 00:31:43.230
I love collaborating
with other players.


161
00:31:44.399 --> 00:31:45.966
But be warned,

162
00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.836
this is an in-game channel

163
00:31:48.869 --> 00:31:51.138
for serious players only.

164
00:31:51.171 --> 00:31:53.240
So if you message me,

165
00:31:53.274 --> 00:31:56.944
I hope that you're ready
to get scared together.


166
00:32:22.002 --> 00:32:23.002
Hello?

167
00:32:33.047 --> 00:32:34.047
Hi.

168
00:32:37.419 --> 00:32:40.020
Thank you for talking with me.

169
00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:47.260
I'm,

170
00:32:48.363 --> 00:32:50.465
I'm sorry my video scared you.

171
00:32:50.498 --> 00:32:52.900
I didn't know how else
to get your attention.


172
00:32:56.070 --> 00:32:57.071
It's okay.

173
00:32:58.906 --> 00:33:00.207
But it's really freaky.

174
00:33:02.377 --> 00:33:03.377
Thanks.

175
00:33:04.912 --> 00:33:07.114
I've seen your videos.

176
00:33:07.147 --> 00:33:08.483
I've been trying

177
00:33:08.516 --> 00:33:09.917
to get in touch with you.

178
00:33:13.087 --> 00:33:15.155
You said you think
I'm in trouble?


179
00:33:22.129 --> 00:33:23.897
How much have you read

180
00:33:23.931 --> 00:33:25.567
about the world's fair?

181
00:33:28.302 --> 00:33:29.903
Just a little bit.

182
00:33:29.937 --> 00:33:32.607
I mean, I mostly just
watch the videos online.


183
00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:35.976
It goes a lot
further back than that.


184
00:33:37.277 --> 00:33:38.946
Oh.

185
00:33:38.979 --> 00:33:40.682
Yeah, there's
a lot of mythology,


186
00:33:40.715 --> 00:33:43.551
lore and history,

187
00:33:43.585 --> 00:33:45.085
different theories

188
00:33:45.119 --> 00:33:47.020
and supernatural events.

189
00:33:47.988 --> 00:33:49.356
It can be confusing

190
00:33:49.391 --> 00:33:51.191
if you're just starting
to learn about it.


191
00:33:51.225 --> 00:33:54.562
But there does seem
to be a pattern.


192
00:33:56.564 --> 00:33:57.665
You do the challenge,

193
00:33:57.699 --> 00:33:59.032
and then you start to change.

194
00:33:59.066 --> 00:33:59.701
Right.

195
00:33:59.734 --> 00:34:01.034
Right.

196
00:34:01.068 --> 00:34:02.136
The video.

197
00:34:02.169 --> 00:34:04.606
It's like a conduit.

198
00:34:04.639 --> 00:34:07.409
It can access your dreams,

199
00:34:07.442 --> 00:34:08.643
the deepest things

200
00:34:08.676 --> 00:34:10.678
you keep hidden, and then,

201
00:34:10.712 --> 00:34:13.013
then it changes you.

202
00:34:14.281 --> 00:34:16.183
I've seen it do things to people

203
00:34:16.216 --> 00:34:18.218
you wouldn't believe.

204
00:34:23.491 --> 00:34:24.592
What are you?

205
00:34:24.626 --> 00:34:25.666
A paranormal investigator?

206
00:34:32.567 --> 00:34:33.567
No.

207
00:34:36.303 --> 00:34:37.237
No.

208
00:34:37.271 --> 00:34:38.271
I'm nobody.

209
00:34:48.383 --> 00:34:50.652
Why are you talking to me?

210
00:34:52.286 --> 00:34:54.622
I want to try to
help you if I can,


211
00:34:55.557 --> 00:34:56.724
but I need to know

212
00:34:58.091 --> 00:34:59.661
that you're telling the truth,

213
00:35:01.463 --> 00:35:04.064
things you described in your
last video in the woods.


214
00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:07.200
I need you

215
00:35:09.303 --> 00:35:11.473
to promise me that
you're not making it up.


216
00:35:16.611 --> 00:35:17.611
No,

217
00:35:18.580 --> 00:35:19.580
I'm not.

218
00:35:25.152 --> 00:35:26.588
How do you know?

219
00:35:28.656 --> 00:35:30.224
I don't.

220
00:35:30.257 --> 00:35:31.257
I mean,

221
00:35:34.127 --> 00:35:37.465
sorry, I'm I'm not that good
at talking with other people.


222
00:35:37.499 --> 00:35:38.533
That's okay.

223
00:35:38.566 --> 00:35:39.566
It's okay.

224
00:35:46.273 --> 00:35:47.475
It's just for most people,

225
00:35:47.509 --> 00:35:49.276
I know it's a really big change,

226
00:35:52.614 --> 00:35:54.214
like they turn into a vampire,

227
00:35:54.248 --> 00:35:55.550
evil clown or something.

228
00:35:59.554 --> 00:36:01.355
It's not what it
feels like for me.


229
00:36:04.459 --> 00:36:06.260
I understand.

230
00:36:10.798 --> 00:36:13.267
It's like I can feel
myself leaving my body.


231
00:36:15.269 --> 00:36:17.237
It's like is making
me someone else.


232
00:36:21.676 --> 00:36:23.343
It's making me bad.

233
00:36:29.384 --> 00:36:31.251
I can't tell my
father about this,


234
00:36:31.285 --> 00:36:32.720
he'll think I'm fucking crazy.

235
00:36:39.561 --> 00:36:42.095
Will you keep making videos

236
00:36:42.129 --> 00:36:43.431
so that I know you're okay?

237
00:36:46.233 --> 00:36:47.233
Deal.

238
00:36:48.469 --> 00:36:49.469
Yeah, I'll try.

239
00:36:59.847 --> 00:37:01.214
Okay, okay.

240
00:37:23.471 --> 00:37:27.408
You know, I knew it
would happened like this.


241
00:37:27.442 --> 00:37:29.242
All my, all my friends,

242
00:37:30.712 --> 00:37:33.246
they were so happy
to just settle


243
00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:34.749
with like a little,

244
00:37:35.817 --> 00:37:37.184
little army men

245
00:37:37.217 --> 00:37:38.553
or Chinese finger traps.

246
00:37:41.723 --> 00:37:42.723
Not me.

247
00:37:44.759 --> 00:37:45.860
I needed to win it.

248
00:37:48.295 --> 00:37:49.931
It was Stitch.

249
00:37:49.964 --> 00:37:54.234
It was my favorite character
from my favorite movie,


250
00:37:55.770 --> 00:37:56.770
big,

251
00:37:58.473 --> 00:38:00.608
fluffy plush doll,

252
00:38:00.642 --> 00:38:02.577
so big and cuddly,

253
00:38:05.647 --> 00:38:08.215
all the way on the top shelf.

254
00:38:08.248 --> 00:38:12.252
And I wanted it
more than anything.


255
00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:16.391
I, I, I dreamt of it even.

256
00:38:16.424 --> 00:38:19.460
I would dream that, that I,

257
00:38:19.494 --> 00:38:20.928
that I'd just take it home

258
00:38:22.630 --> 00:38:23.798
and I would hug it

259
00:38:24.966 --> 00:38:26.434
and love it forever.

260
00:38:43.718 --> 00:38:45.185
It's gotten worse.

261
00:38:46.387 --> 00:38:47.455
But it feels good.

262
00:38:55.530 --> 00:38:56.931
It tingles when you touch it.

263
00:39:09.377 --> 00:39:10.645
What is that?

264
00:39:10.678 --> 00:39:12.547
What is that in there?

265
00:40:35.663 --> 00:40:37.465
Tim pick up.

266
00:40:37.498 --> 00:40:38.533
Don't watch the video.

267
00:40:38.566 --> 00:40:40.568
It's getting stronger.

268
00:40:43.538 --> 00:40:45.338
I want to go to
the world's fair.


269
00:40:51.679 --> 00:40:53.381
I want to go to
the world's fair.


270
00:40:58.719 --> 00:41:01.455
I want to go to
the world's fair.


271
00:43:03.778 --> 00:43:06.547
This is another video for Casey

272
00:43:11.018 --> 00:43:12.018
from JLB.

273
00:43:18.759 --> 00:43:22.163
I'm going to try
recording myself sleeping tonight.


274
00:43:24.198 --> 00:43:25.967
It's November 14th.

275
00:43:27.635 --> 00:43:29.070
11:52 p.m.

276
00:43:36.043 --> 00:43:37.511
It's snowing here today.

277
00:43:41.549 --> 00:43:43.985
I need to figure
out what's going on.


278
00:44:33.801 --> 00:44:35.169
It takes you about seven minutes

279
00:44:35.202 --> 00:44:36.837
to really fall asleep.

280
00:44:40.341 --> 00:44:42.176
Sleep is normal
most of the night.


281
00:44:42.209 --> 00:44:43.844
You toss and turn a little bit.

282
00:44:48.149 --> 00:44:49.149
Now,

283
00:44:51.852 --> 00:44:52.852
watch this.

284
00:44:54.288 --> 00:44:58.959
This is right around

285
00:45:47.375 --> 00:45:48.375
Casey,

286
00:45:49.444 --> 00:45:52.079
this is your scariest video yet.

287
00:45:52.113 --> 00:45:54.215
It's just like
"Paranormal Activity".


288
00:45:54.248 --> 00:45:55.417
It's taking you over

289
00:45:55.450 --> 00:45:57.118
and making you someone else.

290
00:46:00.788 --> 00:46:01.989
Keep making videos

291
00:46:03.425 --> 00:46:05.059
so I know you're still okay.

292
00:46:15.736 --> 00:46:18.005

326
00:49:29.263 --> 00:49:30.263
And there are the desks.

327
00:49:34.034 --> 00:49:36.638
And that's the vice
principal's office.


328
00:49:36.671 --> 00:49:37.671
Watch out.

329
00:49:45.447 --> 00:49:46.447
Leaves.

330
00:50:32.226 --> 00:50:33.293
The AutoZone.

331
00:50:49.377 --> 00:50:50.377
I swear,

332
00:50:51.646 --> 00:50:53.113
some day soon,

333
00:50:54.214 --> 00:50:55.650
I am just gonna disappear

334
00:50:59.052 --> 00:51:01.689
and you won't have any
idea what happened to me.


335
00:51:29.116 --> 00:51:31.285
My father keeps a
gun in the barn.


336
00:51:31.318 --> 00:51:33.455
Thinks I don't know where.

337
00:52:15.162 --> 00:52:16.162
Stop smiling.

338
00:52:23.103 --> 00:52:24.238
Hey, stop smiling.

339
00:52:28.409 --> 00:52:30.745
Stupid, you're an idiot.

340
00:53:49.624 --> 00:53:51.091
I see you there.

341
00:53:55.430 --> 00:53:58.433
Even if you won't
show your face.


342
00:54:04.338 --> 00:54:06.340
You can't can't stop me.

343
00:54:49.917 --> 00:54:52.954
♪ I'm a marshmallow melting ♪

344
00:54:52.987 --> 00:54:56.289

349
00:55:09.003 --> 00:55:11.338
Christmas was fine.

350
00:55:11.372 --> 00:55:13.741
Honestly. I spent most
of it worrying about you,


351
00:55:15.308 --> 00:55:17.578
rewatching your old
videos for clues.


352
00:55:18.913 --> 00:55:22.583
Casey, I can feel the
forces of the fair


353
00:55:22.617 --> 00:55:25.920
pulling you in closer with
each new video you upload.


354
00:55:27.655 --> 00:55:29.490
And I don't really know you,

355
00:55:30.758 --> 00:55:31.959
but I feel like I do.

356
00:55:34.829 --> 00:55:35.863
And I wanna save you.

357
00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:41.268
Send me a message when
you see this video.


358
00:55:42.937 --> 00:55:44.204
We need to talk soon.

359
00:56:15.870 --> 00:56:17.438
Hey guys, Casey here.

360
00:56:17.472 --> 00:56:20.508
So I'm going to be doing
a tarot card reading


361
00:56:20.541 --> 00:56:22.009
for whoever's watching.

362
00:56:26.948 --> 00:56:28.416
You know who you are.

363
00:56:37.792 --> 00:56:39.594
So we have the Knight of Wands,

364
00:56:40.728 --> 00:56:42.497
Knight of Pentacles,

365
00:56:42.530 --> 00:56:43.598
the Hierophant,

366
00:56:43.631 --> 00:56:44.732
Five of Pentacles,

367
00:56:44.766 --> 00:56:45.766
the Chariot,

368
00:56:46.667 --> 00:56:48.369
the Nine of Swords,

369
00:56:48.402 --> 00:56:49.604
the Nine of Cups,

370
00:56:50.605 --> 00:56:51.906
the Eight of Cups,

371
00:56:51.939 --> 00:56:53.574
the High Priestess,

372
00:56:53.608 --> 00:56:55.308
Three of Pentacles

373
00:56:55.342 --> 00:56:56.343
the Empress,

374
00:56:57.411 --> 00:56:59.514
Quee
-King of Sword, excuse me.

375
00:56:59.547 --> 00:57:01.015
Four of Cups, Temperance.

376
00:57:05.453 --> 00:57:07.588
Whoever's watching this

377
00:57:07.622 --> 00:57:09.423
must be a little bit of a,

378
00:57:09.457 --> 00:57:10.658
a lonely person.

379
00:57:11.726 --> 00:57:13.528
Must be a little bit of a person

380
00:57:13.561 --> 00:57:17.632
who seeks comfort in things
that they cannot have


381
00:57:17.665 --> 00:57:19.332
with the Nine of Swords.

382
00:57:19.367 --> 00:57:20.835
Probably has a lot of anxiety,

383
00:57:20.868 --> 00:57:24.972
probably has um, a
lot of mental issues.


384
00:57:26.741 --> 00:57:28.341
The Three of Pentacles.

385
00:57:28.376 --> 00:57:29.811
They're trying to
deceive people.


386
00:57:29.844 --> 00:57:31.445
I don't know if you
guys can see or not.


387
00:57:31.479 --> 00:57:33.714
I could show you
a little closer,


388
00:57:35.483 --> 00:57:37.418
but this guy he's
just walking around


389
00:57:37.451 --> 00:57:39.654
like he knows everything.

390
00:57:41.122 --> 00:57:42.733
I hate people like that
that know everything.


391
00:57:42.757 --> 00:57:44.659
They just always are like,

392
00:57:44.692 --> 00:57:46.093
well, no, this is how it is.

393
00:57:48.029 --> 00:57:49.730
Who are you to
tell me how it is?


394
00:57:52.700 --> 00:57:54.969
Who are you to tell me
how it is, I don't know.


395
00:57:57.071 --> 00:57:58.673
The Chariot.

396
00:57:58.706 --> 00:57:59.750
They keep pushing
a certain agenda


397
00:57:59.774 --> 00:58:02.476
over and over again.

398
00:58:02.510 --> 00:58:05.646
They keep charging forward
with the same boring message,


399
00:58:05.680 --> 00:58:07.682
acting like they're the big guy.

400
00:58:10.718 --> 00:58:13.821
But you have anxiety and you're
lonely and you're fearful.


401
00:58:15.122 --> 00:58:16.858
So how strong are you exactly?

402
00:58:19.126 --> 00:58:20.895
How powerful are you exactly?

403
00:58:22.897 --> 00:58:23.865
Very slow moving.

404
00:58:23.898 --> 00:58:24.966
Nine of Pentacles.

405
00:58:29.470 --> 00:58:31.539
Can't seem to get a
wrap on life, can you?


406
00:58:34.475 --> 00:58:36.577
I appreciate you
guys for watching.


407
00:58:36.611 --> 00:58:40.114
And I'll talk to you
guys another time.


408
00:58:40.147 --> 00:58:41.147
Bye.

409
00:59:04.205 --> 00:59:05.473
My father needs to go.

410
00:59:08.009 --> 00:59:09.010
I know this.

411
00:59:10.778 --> 00:59:12.113
I'll wait until the morning.

412
00:59:14.815 --> 00:59:17.018
It'll be a long time,
but I won't be nervous.


413
00:59:21.222 --> 00:59:23.658
And then at 6am when he gets
up for his first job of the day


414
00:59:23.691 --> 00:59:25.092
I'll be ready for him.

415
00:59:26.627 --> 00:59:28.062
Three shots to the stomach.

416
00:59:29.830 --> 00:59:31.866
And I'll stand there
and watch him bleed.


417
00:59:48.549 --> 00:59:50.084
I don't wanna do it,

418
00:59:51.919 --> 00:59:53.839
but I don't think I'll be
able to control myself.


419
00:59:58.659 --> 00:59:59.760
I don't know.

420
01:00:01.228 --> 01:00:04.231
Maybe I'll just
kill myself instead.


421
01:00:30.091 --> 01:00:31.625
Why won't you help me?

422
01:00:42.903 --> 01:00:43.871
19.

423
01:00:43.904 --> 01:00:44.872
18.

424
01:00:44.905 --> 01:00:45.740
17.

425
01:00:45.773 --> 01:00:46.807
16.

426
01:00:46.841 --> 01:00:47.942
15.

427
01:00:47.975 --> 01:00:49.010
14.

428
01:00:49.043 --> 01:00:50.211
13.

429
01:00:50.244 --> 01:00:51.245
12.

430
01:00:51.278 --> 01:00:52.246
11.

431
01:00:52.279 --> 01:00:53.280
10.

432
01:00:53.314 --> 01:00:54.281
Nine.

433
01:00:54.315 --> 01:00:55.282
Eight.

434
01:00:55.316 --> 01:00:56.283
Seven.

435
01:00:56.317 --> 01:00:57.284
Six.

436
01:00:57.318 --> 01:00:58.152
Five.

437
01:00:58.185 --> 01:00:59.086
Four.

438
01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:00.120
Three.

439
01:01:51.338 --> 01:01:52.773
My name is Poe.

440
01:01:55.209 --> 01:01:56.877
I love you.

441
01:02:33.848 --> 01:02:35.916
I'm still scared of the dark.

442
01:02:46.260 --> 01:02:47.761
This little guy,

443
01:02:52.199 --> 01:02:54.101
he helps me sleep at night.

444
01:03:06.847 --> 01:03:09.116
I had him since I
was five days old.


445
01:05:32.893 --> 01:05:33.893
No.

446
01:05:35.229 --> 01:05:36.229
No.

447
01:05:39.900 --> 01:05:40.900
Poe.

448
01:05:44.905 --> 01:05:46.508
What did I do to you?

449
01:05:53.581 --> 01:05:55.383
What did I do to you?

450
01:06:47.569 --> 01:06:50.170
I know how it's gonna end now.

451
01:06:54.576 --> 01:06:56.478
I'm going inside the video,

452
01:06:59.647 --> 01:07:00.914
through the computer,

453
01:07:04.952 --> 01:07:06.421
inside the screen.

454
01:07:10.692 --> 01:07:14.496
Are you familiar with
the strange loop theory?


455
01:07:18.366 --> 01:07:19.634
The video's a fake,

456
01:07:21.235 --> 01:07:22.604
but so is all of this.

457
01:07:24.706 --> 01:07:27.040
What does that make the video?

458
01:07:36.518 --> 01:07:38.952
Strange loop
theory is one theory,


459
01:07:38.986 --> 01:07:41.321
but have you read
some of the others?


460
01:07:41.355 --> 01:07:42.524
I feel it though.

461
01:07:45.092 --> 01:07:46.528
I think I've always felt it.

462
01:07:48.028 --> 01:07:49.631
This world wasn't real.

463
01:07:49.664 --> 01:07:50.632
It's just some kind of dream

464
01:07:50.665 --> 01:07:52.232
I need to wake up from.

465
01:07:53.401 --> 01:07:55.437
Right.

466
01:07:55.470 --> 01:07:57.237
But have you read about Ka
-Rom?

467
01:07:59.774 --> 01:08:01.241
She was trying to trap you

468
01:08:01.275 --> 01:08:03.143
inside the fair grounds.

469
01:08:03.177 --> 01:08:05.312
That's exactly what
she'd want you to think.


470
01:08:13.421 --> 01:08:16.089
How long do you think I have?

471
01:08:18.325 --> 01:08:20.728
I mean you're the expert, right?

472
01:08:24.699 --> 01:08:26.701
How long until I do it?

473
01:08:33.340 --> 01:08:34.442
No need to sugarcoat it.

474
01:08:34.476 --> 01:08:36.109
I promise I'm not scared.

475
01:08:45.687 --> 01:08:48.021
I need to ask you something.

476
01:08:51.626 --> 01:08:52.460
Sure.

477
01:08:52.494 --> 01:08:54.094
What is it?

478
01:08:54.127 --> 01:08:55.663
Well, we need
to go out of game first.


479
01:08:55.697 --> 01:08:57.264
Is that, is that okay?

480
01:09:00.334 --> 01:09:01.669
Sure.

481
01:09:01.703 --> 01:09:02.703
What's that?

482
01:09:03.638 --> 01:09:05.205
It's an expression.

483
01:09:05.239 --> 01:09:08.443
It means outside of the
margins of the game,


484
01:09:08.476 --> 01:09:09.476
the MMORPG.

485
01:09:15.349 --> 01:09:17.084
I didn't know that term.

486
01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:21.321
Massive multiplayer
online role playing game,


487
01:09:21.355 --> 01:09:22.724
you know it's

488
01:09:22.757 --> 01:09:25.259
just a game we're
playing, right, right.


489
01:09:28.328 --> 01:09:29.328
Oh.

490
01:09:34.369 --> 01:09:36.103
I mean yeah.

491
01:09:37.304 --> 01:09:38.373
Yeah.

492
01:09:38.406 --> 01:09:39.507
And then, you know,

493
01:09:39.541 --> 01:09:41.241
they're just trail heads, right?

494
01:09:41.275 --> 01:09:42.276
The video, Ka
-Rom,

495
01:09:44.311 --> 01:09:45.680
the strange loop theory?

496
01:09:45.713 --> 01:09:47.180
Trail heads?

497
01:09:47.214 --> 01:09:48.383
Stories, yeah,

498
01:09:48.416 --> 01:09:49.551
for us to explore

499
01:09:51.619 --> 01:09:53.755
because I've just
been a little worried


500
01:09:53.788 --> 01:09:55.390
because I guess,

501
01:09:55.423 --> 01:09:57.792
I don't, I don't know
how to say this exactly,


502
01:09:59.326 --> 01:10:01.396
but your videos

503
01:10:02.463 --> 01:10:05.098
have been pretty intense lately.

504
01:10:06.401 --> 01:10:08.836
Well, it's a horror game, right?

505
01:10:10.438 --> 01:10:12.205
Yeah, it's a horror game,

506
01:10:12.239 --> 01:10:13.239
but I,

507
01:10:14.809 --> 01:10:15.643
I don't know.

508
01:10:15.677 --> 01:10:16.677
When I was

509
01:10:17.478 --> 01:10:18.646
still in high school,

510
01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:20.615
and I had a tough time too,

511
01:10:20.648 --> 01:10:23.283
and I know it can
be hard sometimes,


512
01:10:23.317 --> 01:10:26.854
and maybe you get stupid
thoughts in your head.


513
01:10:29.457 --> 01:10:30.425
What,

514
01:10:30.458 --> 01:10:31.458
what do you think?

515
01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:34.462
I was actually
gonna kill myself?


516
01:10:38.533 --> 01:10:39.500
I, I, I...

517
01:10:39.534 --> 01:10:40.702
Or kill somebody else?

518
01:10:43.371 --> 01:10:44.772
I was just worried.

519
01:10:44.806 --> 01:10:45.849
I wasn't sure if
you were playing,


520
01:10:45.873 --> 01:10:47.609
or acting,

521
01:10:47.642 --> 01:10:49.444
or letting off
steam or whatever.


522
01:10:50.812 --> 01:10:53.381
Or if you kind of meant it.

523
01:10:56.751 --> 01:10:59.520
I thought about
reporting your videos,


524
01:10:59.554 --> 01:11:01.556
but I don't know.

525
01:11:01.589 --> 01:11:03.658
I know it doesn't
really do anything.


526
01:11:03.691 --> 01:11:05.258
I could call police.

527
01:11:05.292 --> 01:11:07.227
I don't really know
where you live.


528
01:11:07.260 --> 01:11:10.398
You thought about
calling the fucking police!


529
01:11:11.366 --> 01:11:12.500
Jesus Christ!

530
01:11:13.434 --> 01:11:14.435
They're just videos.

531
01:11:14.469 --> 01:11:15.603
What is wrong with you?

532
01:11:18.606 --> 01:11:20.207
They're pretend.

533
01:11:22.342 --> 01:11:23.411
I have to go.

534
01:11:26.213 --> 01:11:27.314
Casey.

535
01:11:27.347 --> 01:11:28.816
That's not even my name.

536
01:11:28.850 --> 01:11:30.418
Wait.

537
01:13:27.468 --> 01:13:30.605
I'm sorry, you seem
like you're, you know.


538
01:13:51.526 --> 01:13:52.794
I just need you to-

539
01:13:59.467 --> 01:14:00.467
No, no.

540
01:16:35.623 --> 01:16:36.891
I swear,

541
01:16:38.192 --> 01:16:39.593
someday soon.

542
01:16:40.761 --> 01:16:42.196
I am just gonna disappear.

543
01:16:45.199 --> 01:16:48.169
And you won't have any
idea what happened to me.


544
01:17:02.183 --> 01:17:04.185
It wasn't until a year later,

545
01:17:04.218 --> 01:17:06.120
I finally heard from her.

546
01:17:15.629 --> 01:17:17.832
She sent me a message on Skype,

547
01:17:19.667 --> 01:17:20.667
apologizing for

548
01:17:21.902 --> 01:17:23.070
not responding sooner.

549
01:17:28.576 --> 01:17:29.577
She told me that

550
01:17:31.045 --> 01:17:32.880
she had spent some time

551
01:17:32.913 --> 01:17:36.650
in an assisted care facility
that winter and spring.


552
01:17:38.319 --> 01:17:40.855
And then she only now felt
comfortable with writing.


553
01:18:00.274 --> 01:18:02.643
We traded messages for a while.

554
01:18:03.844 --> 01:18:05.613
She told me her real name.

555
01:18:05.646 --> 01:18:06.914
I told her mine.

556
01:18:09.250 --> 01:18:12.653
She told me she was
starting a theater program


557
01:18:12.686 --> 01:18:13.854
in the city that spring.

558
01:18:15.289 --> 01:18:17.691
We met for coffee in Manhattan.

559
01:18:18.759 --> 01:18:20.127
And she finally saw my face.

560
01:18:24.865 --> 01:18:27.101
We made the awkward small talk.

561
01:18:27.134 --> 01:18:29.904
I think we both felt
weird sitting there,


562
01:18:29.937 --> 01:18:32.173
actually in front of one
another after all this time,


563
01:18:32.206 --> 01:18:36.077
like we both had so much to say,

564
01:18:36.110 --> 01:18:37.912
we just didn't know
where to begin.


565
01:18:41.148 --> 01:18:42.148
Afterward,

566
01:18:43.751 --> 01:18:45.953
we walked uptown together,

567
01:18:47.254 --> 01:18:49.391
her towards the subway,

568
01:18:49.424 --> 01:18:51.692
me towards the Long
Island railroad.


569
01:18:53.727 --> 01:18:55.696
And it was only
outside the subway


570
01:18:55.729 --> 01:18:58.132
that I finally worked up
the courage to ask her


571
01:19:01.369 --> 01:19:02.369
about that night.

572
01:19:05.206 --> 01:19:06.807
Before I could get
the full question out,


573
01:19:06.841 --> 01:19:08.109
she cut me off.

574
01:19:10.244 --> 01:19:13.714
She apologized for the things
she'd said to me that night.


575
01:19:14.949 --> 01:19:16.250
I told her it was all right.

576
01:19:17.318 --> 01:19:18.853
I knew she didn't mean them.

577
01:19:21.255 --> 01:19:23.791
And then she didn't say
anything for a long time.


578
01:19:26.428 --> 01:19:28.262
But when she spoke again,

579
01:19:33.234 --> 01:19:35.136
it was like

580
01:19:35.169 --> 01:19:39.673
she knew she was about to say
something that she shouldn't.


581
01:19:50.050 --> 01:19:52.253
That night I made it there.

582
01:19:54.955 --> 01:19:57.958
I know it sounds
crazy, but it's true.


583
01:19:57.992 --> 01:19:59.026
I made it there,

584
01:20:00.828 --> 01:20:02.096
to the planetarium,

585
01:20:03.297 --> 01:20:04.665
across the crowds,

586
01:20:05.733 --> 01:20:07.067
into the heart of the fair.

587
01:20:09.303 --> 01:20:11.105
But something brought me back.

588
01:20:13.140 --> 01:20:14.875
I don't know what it was.

589
01:20:19.780 --> 01:20:20.780
So I told her

590
01:20:22.249 --> 01:20:24.785
how I had stayed up that night,

591
01:20:24.818 --> 01:20:28.822
all night till dawn with my
hands on the computer screen


592
01:20:28.856 --> 01:20:30.224
and how I'd prayed for her.

593
01:20:36.163 --> 01:20:37.163
I know.

594
01:20:38.098 --> 01:20:39.098
I felt it.

595
01:20:49.511 --> 01:20:50.511
We were hungry,

596
01:20:51.912 --> 01:20:54.382
so we grabbed
dollar pizza slices


597
01:20:54.416 --> 01:20:56.050
from the dollar pizza place,

598
01:20:57.851 --> 01:21:00.422
made plans to meet up
again soon and see a movie.


599
01:21:01.556 --> 01:21:03.023
And then we said goodnight.

600
01:21:04.526 --> 01:21:07.094
We hugged on the street
outside Penn station.


601
01:21:10.364 --> 01:21:14.235
I couldn't believe I
was actually there,


602
01:21:16.471 --> 01:21:17.938
that I was touching her.

603
01:21:29.183 --> 01:21:31.752
And then we both
made our way home.
