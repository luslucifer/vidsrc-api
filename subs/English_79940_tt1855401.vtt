1
00:00:17.536 --> 00:00:18.821
Oh.

2
00:00:18.996 --> 00:00:21.783
Oh, good morning.
Hi. Hi. Hi.


3
00:00:21.957 --> 00:00:24.494
I'm Chef Goldblum.

4
00:00:25.502 --> 00:00:27.163
And right now

5
00:00:27.337 --> 00:00:29.749
I'll bet you're probably
just getting comfortable


6
00:00:29.923 --> 00:00:32.630
in your own
Schlaaang Super Seat.


7
00:00:32.801 --> 00:00:35.258
But maybe you're
asking yourself,


8
00:00:35.429 --> 00:00:38.887
"What the heck is this
Schlaaang Super Seat exactly?"


9
00:00:41.268 --> 00:00:44.010
Here's how the Schlaaang
Super Seat works!


10
00:00:44.187 --> 00:00:46.052
First, several needles

11
00:00:46.231 --> 00:00:48.222
are connected to
a vein in your arm.


12
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.392
Chemicals are then introduced
to synchronize your emotions


13
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.481
with the movie.

14
00:00:53.655 --> 00:00:56.021
Next, air tubes are inserted
into the nasal cavity


15
00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:59.066
to guide you into
a natural breathing pattern.


16
00:00:59.244 --> 00:01:01.075
Exotic odors are released

17
00:01:01.246 --> 00:01:03.157
to match the excitement
of the movie.


18
00:01:03.332 --> 00:01:06.620
Finally, your legs are moved
out of your line of sight


19
00:01:06.793 --> 00:01:09.910
and into our patented
Schlaaang stirrups,


20
00:01:10.088 --> 00:01:13.580
to give you a viewing experience
you'll never forget.


21
00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:15.795
Oh! Oh! Oh!
I gotta tell you.


22
00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:18.756
My favorite thing about this
whole Schlaaang Super Seat


23
00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.264
is the automatic popcorn
machine in the armrest.


24
00:01:23.435 --> 00:01:26.472
Of course, be careful.
I-- you know, I actually did this.


25
00:01:26.647 --> 00:01:28.763
That hot butter
is gonna come spurting out.


26
00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.727
Don't get it on your hand.
It's gonna burn.


27
00:01:31.902 --> 00:01:33.108
And remember,

28
00:01:33.278 --> 00:01:36.395
if you're not sitting
in a Schlaaang Super Seat...


29
00:01:37.407 --> 00:01:39.568
you're just not
sitting down.


30
00:01:40.786 --> 00:01:42.151
The Schlaaang Super Seat.

31
00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.446
The ultimate film-watching
seating experience!


32
00:01:57.344 --> 00:01:59.835
Close your left eye.

33
00:02:00.013 --> 00:02:03.722
Now rapidly open and close
your left eye like this.


34
00:02:07.938 --> 00:02:09.644
Wow! This is easy.

35
00:02:09.815 --> 00:02:11.931
Now close your right eye.

36
00:02:13.402 --> 00:02:17.020
Now rapidly open and close
your right eye like this.


37
00:02:20.117 --> 00:02:21.323
Thank you.

38
00:02:21.493 --> 00:02:23.984
It is advised to remove your
dentures or false teeth


39
00:02:24.162 --> 00:02:25.993
before the movie begins.

40
00:03:47.287 --> 00:03:49.494
I've been walking down
these streets for years.


41
00:03:49.664 --> 00:03:51.120
Bonjour, Diamond Jim.

42
00:03:51.291 --> 00:03:52.781
Bonjour.

43
00:03:54.169 --> 00:03:56.455
Diamond Jim,
good to see you.


44
00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:58.086
Bonjour.

45
00:03:58.256 --> 00:03:59.792
They all know my name.

46
00:03:59.966 --> 00:04:02.048
But I can't say
that I know theirs.


47
00:04:02.219 --> 00:04:04.926
Bonjour.

48
00:04:05.096 --> 00:04:08.805
- What can I say?
- sweet Paris.


49
00:04:10.435 --> 00:04:12.300
Bonjour.

50
00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:15.266
The smell of baguettes, flowers,

51
00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.352
fresh meat in the air.

52
00:04:18.527 --> 00:04:19.892
Bonjour.

53
00:04:21.863 --> 00:04:26.357
Bonjour.

54
00:04:26.535 --> 00:04:28.742
This is a town full of beautiful people

55
00:04:28.912 --> 00:04:30.243
all around you.

56
00:04:30.413 --> 00:04:31.653
Bonjour.

57
00:04:31.832 --> 00:04:33.572
Oui, oui. Magnifique.

58
00:04:36.795 --> 00:04:40.128
I'm Diamond Jim.
This is my home.


59
00:04:40.298 --> 00:04:41.834
My people.

60
00:04:47.973 --> 00:04:50.840
But there's only one
that has my attention.


61
00:05:02.404 --> 00:05:05.111
What can I get you,
Diamond Jim?


62
00:05:05.282 --> 00:05:07.989
What do I have to do
to get you to finally go out with me?


63
00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:09.990
Well...

64
00:05:12.247 --> 00:05:14.784
a girl cannot
say no to diamonds.


65
00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:17.825
Well, why didn't
you say so?


66
00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:27.501
Oh, my God,
it is so beautiful.


67
00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.341
Now kiss me.

68
00:06:18.688 --> 00:06:20.679
What the fuck was that?

69
00:06:24.235 --> 00:06:25.771
- That's it.
- That's our movie.


70
00:06:25.946 --> 00:06:28.437
- Should we?
- Let's go make a speech.


71
00:06:29.908 --> 00:06:31.819
Okay.

72
00:06:34.663 --> 00:06:37.450
One more second.

73
00:06:37.624 --> 00:06:39.740
This is the story of Tim and Eric.

74
00:06:39.918 --> 00:06:41.249
They were given
$1 billion


75
00:06:41.419 --> 00:06:42.659
to make their first
feature film


76
00:06:42.837 --> 00:06:44.577
Tommy Schlaaang.

77
00:06:44.756 --> 00:06:48.123
I paid a billion dollars
for that piece of shit?


78
00:06:48.301 --> 00:06:50.633
But Tim and Eric did not
spend their money wisely.


79
00:06:50.804 --> 00:06:52.340
Despite the record-setting
budget,


80
00:06:52.514 --> 00:06:53.799
they were only able
to edit together


81
00:06:53.974 --> 00:06:56.090
three minutes
of useable footage.


82
00:06:56.267 --> 00:06:57.757
They had expensive
personal make-overs.


83
00:06:57.936 --> 00:06:59.927
These two guys don't get
into premiere parties.


84
00:07:00.105 --> 00:07:02.938
These guys get in the front of
the line at premiere parties.


85
00:07:03.108 --> 00:07:05.144
And they accidentally cast
a Johnny Depp impersonator


86
00:07:05.318 --> 00:07:06.808
instead of the genuine
Johnny Depp.


87
00:07:06.987 --> 00:07:08.943
- You said it was Johnny Depp.
- It smelled like Johnny Depp.


88
00:07:09.114 --> 00:07:10.945
Everyone said this is Johnny Depp
on the set. It was a big day.


89
00:07:11.116 --> 00:07:14.199
No, it wasn't Johnny Depp.
I know my Johnny Depp.


90
00:07:14.369 --> 00:07:17.111
Other expenses included
helicopter rides to work,


91
00:07:17.288 --> 00:07:18.949
10-course lunches,

92
00:07:19.124 --> 00:07:20.955
and real diamonds
for the Diamond Jim suit.


93
00:07:21.126 --> 00:07:23.458
The diamonds are forever,
though, and we can't return them, so...


94
00:07:24.462 --> 00:07:25.577
Those diamonds
aren't going back.


95
00:07:25.755 --> 00:07:27.291
They hired a personal shopper

96
00:07:27.465 --> 00:07:29.956
and spiritual guru
named Jim Joe Kelly,


97
00:07:30.135 --> 00:07:32.797
who they paid an astonishing
$500,000 a week.


98
00:07:32.971 --> 00:07:34.552
I'm not even walking on a set
without Jim Joe.


99
00:07:34.723 --> 00:07:36.338
If you think I'm gonna
get involved in something


100
00:07:36.516 --> 00:07:38.177
without him being a part of this,
then you're out of your mind.


101
00:07:38.351 --> 00:07:40.342
They also employed a team
of personal assistants,


102
00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:42.602
including this
small man named Jason.


103
00:07:42.772 --> 00:07:44.308
Not now.

104
00:07:44.482 --> 00:07:47.098
Tim and I are making a speech about
our movie, and you fucking blew it.


105
00:07:47.277 --> 00:07:50.735
Come on, Jason, we need the hot corn
before the movie, not after the movie.


106
00:07:52.741 --> 00:07:54.402
- You mind if I do it?
- Go ahead.


107
00:07:54.576 --> 00:07:55.816
Come on!

108
00:07:55.994 --> 00:07:58.030
Now sit down.
Sorry about that, gang.


109
00:07:58.204 --> 00:08:00.320
But perhaps
most foolishly of all,


110
00:08:00.498 --> 00:08:02.363
they signed a
legally binding contract


111
00:08:02.542 --> 00:08:04.157
with the Schlaaang Corporation
which held them


112
00:08:04.335 --> 00:08:06.417
personally responsible
for the $1 billion.


113
00:08:06.588 --> 00:08:08.874
I want my money back!

114
00:08:09.049 --> 00:08:12.382
We're going to sue you
for every dime.


115
00:08:12.552 --> 00:08:15.294
You motherfuckers
are going to jail


116
00:08:15.472 --> 00:08:17.633
for what you did!

117
00:08:17.807 --> 00:08:19.343
After several
threatening letters


118
00:08:19.517 --> 00:08:21.053
from the Schlaaang
Corporation,


119
00:08:21.227 --> 00:08:23.092
Tim and Eric realized
they needed a plan


120
00:08:23.271 --> 00:08:24.807
to pay back Schlaaang's
billion dollars.


121
00:08:24.981 --> 00:08:27.142
- Shred it.
- Okay.


122
00:08:27.317 --> 00:08:30.150
We've really got to think
of a way to get that money back.


123
00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:32.276
There's got to be
an easy way to do it here.


124
00:08:32.447 --> 00:08:34.028
Are you guys hungry?

125
00:08:34.199 --> 00:08:37.407
We could get some beef chili
and hot dog buns


126
00:08:37.577 --> 00:08:40.159
Iike you like to put your mouth
around like you like to do.


127
00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:42.821
Ma! When we're hungry,
I'll ring the bell.


128
00:08:42.999 --> 00:08:45.035
Then you'll know
to put some chili on.


129
00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:48.373
After days of workshopping failed ideas,

130
00:08:48.546 --> 00:08:50.537
Tim and Eric faced
the very real threat


131
00:08:50.715 --> 00:08:52.706
of spending the rest
of their lives in jail.


132
00:08:52.884 --> 00:08:55.045
But first they had to
terminate their relationship


133
00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:57.427
with their trusted friend
and spiritual guru,


134
00:08:57.597 --> 00:08:58.837
Jim Joe Kelly.

135
00:08:59.015 --> 00:09:00.255
You're not going to believe
what I bought for you.


136
00:09:00.433 --> 00:09:02.048
We've got to tell him.

137
00:09:02.227 --> 00:09:04.218
Oh, mercy.

138
00:09:11.402 --> 00:09:14.815
I'm sensing some...
real depression here.


139
00:09:14.989 --> 00:09:16.229
What's going on?

140
00:09:16.407 --> 00:09:18.068
Tell him.

141
00:09:18.243 --> 00:09:19.608
Jim Joe, we have
to let you go.


142
00:09:19.786 --> 00:09:22.402
Wha...

143
00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:25.117
- I'm sorry.
- What? What?


144
00:09:25.291 --> 00:09:27.282
- It's all over, Jim Joe.
- What?


145
00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:30.076
- It's okay.
- What?


146
00:09:30.255 --> 00:09:33.042
- It's okay, Jim Joe.
- Breathe.


147
00:09:33.216 --> 00:09:34.547
I can't--

148
00:09:34.717 --> 00:09:35.957
- Breathe.
- Oh!


149
00:09:36.136 --> 00:09:38.752
- Jim Joe?
- Oh, God.


150
00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:40.420
Ohh!

151
00:09:41.432 --> 00:09:43.889
No! No!

152
00:09:48.982 --> 00:09:50.722
Pull him up.

153
00:09:54.654 --> 00:09:56.895
One, two, three!

154
00:10:00.118 --> 00:10:02.029
That's not how you do CPR.
You go like this.


155
00:10:11.629 --> 00:10:13.210
See? Do it. Shit.
He's drying out.


156
00:10:13.381 --> 00:10:15.713
- He's drying out! Put him back in!
- Change our plan!


157
00:10:20.138 --> 00:10:24.006
I can't breathe! 
I can't breathe!

158
00:10:31.482 --> 00:10:33.473
No. No, no, no, no.

159
00:10:33.651 --> 00:10:36.984
Just steep it.

160
00:10:40.783 --> 00:10:43.024
Why can't I just work
at a reduced rate?


161
00:10:43.203 --> 00:10:46.570
The money's gone. We lost a billion
dollars. We're screwed.


162
00:10:46.748 --> 00:10:50.036
Easy, Jim Joe.

163
00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:51.666
Easy.

164
00:10:51.836 --> 00:10:54.669
After all that I've
done for you!


165
00:10:55.673 --> 00:10:57.504
Oh, Jim Joe.

166
00:10:59.219 --> 00:11:01.585
This is so much harder
for us than it is for you.


167
00:11:01.763 --> 00:11:03.253
All right. We're sorry.
We're just broke.


168
00:11:16.527 --> 00:11:18.063
Great singing voice.

169
00:11:21.616 --> 00:11:23.572
He's wonderful.

170
00:11:23.743 --> 00:11:25.608
He's remarkable.

171
00:11:31.376 --> 00:11:33.241
I guess this is goodbye.

172
00:11:33.419 --> 00:11:35.159
Time to move on.

173
00:11:38.007 --> 00:11:39.247
Please out.

174
00:11:39.425 --> 00:11:42.383
Is it "please out"
or "peace out"?


175
00:11:42.553 --> 00:11:44.714
- It's up to you.
- Enjoy it.


176
00:11:44.889 --> 00:11:46.675
Please out.

177
00:11:54.399 --> 00:11:56.060
So, with nowhere left to go,

178
00:11:56.234 --> 00:11:57.849
Tim and Eric headed
to their favorite nightclub,


179
00:11:58.027 --> 00:12:00.814
Circus Disco,
to drown their sorrows.


180
00:12:05.827 --> 00:12:07.738
I don't know what we're
going to do, man.


181
00:12:07.912 --> 00:12:09.448
I think we're finished.

182
00:12:09.622 --> 00:12:11.738
We screwed up.
No one's ever gonna let us


183
00:12:11.916 --> 00:12:13.656
direct another movie
after that shit.


184
00:12:13.835 --> 00:12:16.827
You know, I used to have this
crazy fantasy of the two of us


185
00:12:17.005 --> 00:12:18.791
walking hand in hand
down that red carpet


186
00:12:18.965 --> 00:12:20.455
on our way
to the Academy Awards.


187
00:12:20.633 --> 00:12:22.123
That's nice.

188
00:12:22.302 --> 00:12:24.509
I don't think
it's gonna happen.


189
00:12:24.679 --> 00:12:26.590
I just want to get
fucking drunk.


190
00:12:26.764 --> 00:12:28.925
Forget about all this
billion-dollar bullshit.


191
00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:30.931
I'm glad you said it because
I'm feeling the same way.


192
00:12:31.102 --> 00:12:33.058
I want to get
so fucking high.


193
00:12:33.229 --> 00:12:35.390
- I want a hashish.
- I'm gonna get skit on my nose.


194
00:12:35.565 --> 00:12:36.771
Yo, I want to go dumb.

195
00:12:36.941 --> 00:12:38.272
I want to cut
my fucking arm off.


196
00:12:38.443 --> 00:12:40.434
I'd love to fucking get
blackout-drunk with you,


197
00:12:40.611 --> 00:12:41.646
get a bunch of dudes,

198
00:12:41.821 --> 00:12:43.231
put a bunch of shit
up our holes.


199
00:12:43.406 --> 00:12:44.896
Yeah,
let's go fucking nuts.


200
00:12:45.074 --> 00:12:46.564

Yeah.

- You all right?
- Yeah.


228
00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:18.994
Do you want to make
a billion dollars?


229
00:14:19.168 --> 00:14:22.376
It's easy. Come and run my mall.
You'll be rich.


230
00:14:22.547 --> 00:14:23.957
Hey, Eric,
come check this out.


231
00:14:24.132 --> 00:14:26.839
You all love malls,
so take my mall.


232
00:14:27.009 --> 00:14:28.374
What's the matter?

233
00:14:28.553 --> 00:14:30.089
You don't want to make
a billion dollars?


234
00:14:30.263 --> 00:14:32.424
Anyone can run
a stupid fucking mall,


235
00:14:32.598 --> 00:14:34.088
even you.

236
00:14:34.267 --> 00:14:37.100
Are you a man,
or possibly two men,


237
00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:38.931
who need to make
a billion dollars?


238
00:14:39.105 --> 00:14:40.845
Come and run my mall.
We're having hard times.


239
00:14:41.023 --> 00:14:44.106
We need your ideas.
Everybody needs a billion.


240
00:14:44.277 --> 00:14:47.019
Come and take over the S'wallow Valley
Mall and pizza court.


241
00:14:47.196 --> 00:14:48.686
It's easy.
Not hard.


242
00:14:48.865 --> 00:14:50.230
I said it's easy,
not hard.


243
00:14:50.408 --> 00:14:53.866
There's never been an easier
way to make a billion dollars.


244
00:14:54.036 --> 00:14:56.823
It's easy. And here's
- it's easy.


245
00:14:56.998 --> 00:14:59.284
What's the matter? You don't want
to make a billion dollars?


246
00:14:59.459 --> 00:15:01.245
My day wasn't going good
until I put on these--


247
00:15:01.419 --> 00:15:03.330
Billion dollars.

248
00:15:03.504 --> 00:15:04.664
Man, I love this--

249
00:15:04.839 --> 00:15:05.828
Billion dollars.

250
00:15:07.717 --> 00:15:11.426
I'm giving away a billion--
billion dollars!


251
00:15:11.596 --> 00:15:13.837
But you gotta
run my mall.


252
00:15:14.015 --> 00:15:16.427
Please save our mall.
We need your help.


253
00:15:16.601 --> 00:15:17.886
Ah.

254
00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:21.143
I work at one of the kiosks,
and it would mean the world


255
00:15:21.314 --> 00:15:24.431
- if someone would come in here...
- She's so beautiful.


256
00:15:24.609 --> 00:15:27.396
...and help us make
this mall great again.


257
00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:29.276
Come to the S'wallow Valley Mall,

258
00:15:29.447 --> 00:15:31.233
right off the 182 freeway
in S'wallow Valley.


259
00:15:31.407 --> 00:15:33.944
Sounds crazy, Eric,
I know, but I think we can do this.


260
00:15:34.118 --> 00:15:35.107
Yo, I like it.

261
00:15:35.286 --> 00:15:37.197
- This mall could be easy money, man.
- That's right.


262
00:15:37.371 --> 00:15:39.737
You know what? And I'm really good at
numbers, accounting, all that stuff.


263
00:15:39.916 --> 00:15:42.874
Well, you know me. I'm a big P.R.,
strategy, marketing kind of guy.


264
00:15:43.044 --> 00:15:45.285
But you know,
more importantly, man,


265
00:15:45.463 --> 00:15:48.000
I just want to say this could
be a fresh start for us.


266
00:15:48.174 --> 00:15:50.130
We could forget all about
this Hollywood bullshit


267
00:15:50.301 --> 00:15:51.711
and really reinvent
ourselves.


268
00:15:51.886 --> 00:15:53.877
Yeah. You know, I've been meaning
to tell you this all night,


269
00:15:54.055 --> 00:15:56.091
but I love you, man.
And I love our friendship.


270
00:15:56.265 --> 00:15:57.801
Well, thank you.
I honor you,


271
00:15:57.975 --> 00:15:59.806
and I honor our friendship,
and I honor our love.


272
00:15:59.977 --> 00:16:02.810
It would mean a lot to me
if we could run this mall


273
00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:04.720
and I could make love
to this hot woman


274
00:16:04.899 --> 00:16:06.560
and we could start a business
partnership together.


275
00:16:06.734 --> 00:16:08.144
I love it, but I've
got a big problem.


276
00:16:08.319 --> 00:16:09.559
I hate to do this
to you here.


277
00:16:09.737 --> 00:16:11.602
I need to have an emergency
business meeting right now.


278
00:16:11.781 --> 00:16:14.022
Because guess what? We don't have
a name for our company yet.


279
00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:16.657
Shit.

280
00:16:16.827 --> 00:16:17.816
All right.
What are we good at?


281
00:16:17.995 --> 00:16:19.326
Well, we're men
who do business.


282
00:16:19.497 --> 00:16:20.486
We want to be
business members.


283
00:16:20.665 --> 00:16:22.155
We're boys
who do business.


284
00:16:22.333 --> 00:16:23.664
- Yeah.
- But...


285
00:16:25.419 --> 00:16:27.330
Eric. Look.

286
00:16:30.424 --> 00:16:31.755
It's a sign.

287
00:16:31.926 --> 00:16:33.757
"Doing business."

288
00:16:33.928 --> 00:16:36.886
"Dobis."

289
00:16:37.056 --> 00:16:39.422
I love it. It's got a ring
to it, doesn't it?


290
00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:40.760
- Yeah.
- Dobis.


291
00:16:40.935 --> 00:16:43.642
"That's who we are."
We're Dobis P.R.


292
00:16:43.813 --> 00:16:45.223
Dobis.

293
00:16:45.398 --> 00:16:48.481
- Look at that.
- Look at all the elements of business.


294
00:16:48.651 --> 00:16:51.484
- Look it. They're all there, Eric.
- Market research.


295
00:16:51.654 --> 00:16:55.488
- There's strategic P.R.
- Profit and loss.


296
00:16:55.658 --> 00:16:58.866
I'll have the report
to you by Monday.


297
00:16:59.036 --> 00:17:00.867
I'll look forward to it.

298
00:17:01.038 --> 00:17:02.323
Guys,

299
00:17:02.498 --> 00:17:04.204
I told you, you should
never have fired me.


300
00:17:04.375 --> 00:17:06.036
Jim Joe,
what do you want?


301
00:17:06.210 --> 00:17:09.373
I've got some poetry about regret
I'd like to share with you.


302
00:17:09.547 --> 00:17:10.536
Come on, Jim Joe.

303
00:17:10.715 --> 00:17:13.627
Friendship is warm,
friendship is touch.


304
00:17:13.801 --> 00:17:15.416
Jim Joe, please stop.

305
00:17:15.595 --> 00:17:17.927
We have to do this for ourselves.
We're sorry.


306
00:17:18.097 --> 00:17:20.463
- We've got to leave you behind.
- I'm sick, and I'm lost,


307
00:17:20.641 --> 00:17:21.881
and I'm tired
of floating around.


308
00:17:22.059 --> 00:17:24.550
We love you, Jim Joe.
We wish you the best.


309
00:17:24.729 --> 00:17:26.344
Let's go.

Hi, this is Tim and Eric.

319
00:18:15.112 --> 00:18:16.352
Sorry we're not
here right now.


320
00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:17.986
We've left town to become
business members.


321
00:18:18.157 --> 00:18:19.237
We are now Dobis.

322
00:18:19.408 --> 00:18:20.648
Please leave a message
for Dobis.


323
00:18:20.826 --> 00:18:22.362
Be blessed.

324
00:18:22.536 --> 00:18:24.117
Shit.

325
00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:31.951
Son of a bitch.

326
00:18:32.129 --> 00:18:33.869
They just skipped town
on us, Tommy.


327
00:18:34.048 --> 00:18:36.790
- You find them.
- Mm-hmm.


328
00:18:36.967 --> 00:18:39.925
Find them if it's
the last thing you do.


329
00:18:40.096 --> 00:18:42.132
I want to drink their blood.

330
00:18:42.306 --> 00:18:45.048
- I want to take a knife and gut them!
- Yes.


331
00:18:45.226 --> 00:18:48.093
Oh, God, let me watch
their insides fall out.


332
00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:51.353
Yes. Yes. Yes.
What else, Tommy?


333
00:18:51.524 --> 00:18:53.731
- I want to strap them up--
- Yes.


334
00:18:53.901 --> 00:18:56.142
And let a bamboo tree grow
right up into their ass, huh?


335
00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:57.526
Yes.

336
00:18:57.697 --> 00:18:59.403
Until the tree grows straight
through their brains!


337
00:18:59.573 --> 00:19:02.565
Yes. And I will
deliver them unto you.


338
00:19:02.743 --> 00:19:04.825
I want to eat
their fucking hearts!


339
00:19:04.995 --> 00:19:06.155
Yeah!

340
00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:08.912
Yes. Yes. Yes.

341
00:19:15.005 --> 00:19:16.666
Okay.
Tell me what you think.


342
00:19:16.841 --> 00:19:18.331
Uh, "Dear Mr. Weebs,

343
00:19:18.509 --> 00:19:22.172
We are very, very, very,
very excited to meet you.


344
00:19:22.346 --> 00:19:24.337
We are Dobis."

345
00:19:24.515 --> 00:19:26.972
That's all I've got so far.
What do you think?


346
00:19:27.143 --> 00:19:29.350
Oh, I'm sorry, dude.
I wasn't listening to you.


347
00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:31.932
I'm just so focused
on this ridiculous look.


348
00:19:32.106 --> 00:19:33.812
It's not working anymore.

349
00:19:33.983 --> 00:19:35.689
Let me take a look.

350
00:19:37.403 --> 00:19:39.519
It's just not right.

351
00:19:41.073 --> 00:19:43.029
You know what, Eric, if we're
going to be businessmen,


352
00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:45.907
I think maybe we should
look like businessmen, too.


353
00:19:46.078 --> 00:19:47.864
- I agree.
- Hold on a second.


354
00:19:57.965 --> 00:19:59.671
Now hold still.

355
00:20:09.059 --> 00:20:10.094
Goodbye.

356
00:20:16.525 --> 00:20:18.061
Oh!

357
00:21:57.293 --> 00:22:00.035
Good night, Katie.
I miss you, my sweets.


358
00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:05.672
Boy, you're really getting
attached to that photo, bud.


359
00:22:05.843 --> 00:22:07.629
Tim, it's not
just a picture, man.


360
00:22:07.803 --> 00:22:09.293
That could be
the girl of my dreams.


361
00:22:09.471 --> 00:22:10.927
All right. Let's just
try to stay focused


362
00:22:11.098 --> 00:22:12.338
on what's important here.

363
00:22:12.516 --> 00:22:14.848
Ever since I saw you
in that commercial, Katie,


364
00:22:15.019 --> 00:22:16.850
I felt this electricity
in my heart.


365
00:22:17.021 --> 00:22:19.353
I can't wait to meet you
and make love to you


366
00:22:19.523 --> 00:22:21.514
and go deep inside you
and show you my mushroom tip.


367
00:22:21.692 --> 00:22:24.479
All right, well,
I'm hitting the sack.


368
00:22:39.084 --> 00:22:40.745
Oh.

369
00:22:41.879 --> 00:22:43.369
What the hell?

370
00:22:43.547 --> 00:22:46.004
Okay.

371
00:22:46.175 --> 00:22:49.633
- Katie.
- Okay.


372
00:22:49.803 --> 00:22:51.043
All right.

373
00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:57.800
You want to finish
that in the bathroom?


374
00:22:57.978 --> 00:23:00.685
Almost done.
Almost done.


375
00:23:15.287 --> 00:23:18.120
Okay. Well, I'm gonna
say good night, then.

00:24:03.877 --> 00:24:05.538
We could turn around
right now if you want.


384
00:24:05.713 --> 00:24:07.249
No.

385
00:24:07.423 --> 00:24:09.129
I'm ready.

386
00:24:10.551 --> 00:24:11.961
All right.
Let's go.


387
00:24:28.318 --> 00:24:29.558
Hello?

388
00:24:31.905 --> 00:24:33.645
Mr. Weebs?

389
00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:55.046
Mr. Weebs?

390
00:24:57.681 --> 00:25:00.593
Mr. Weebs?
Hello?


391
00:25:01.685 --> 00:25:02.845
- What? What the--
- Mr. Weebs?


392
00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:04.351
Go to heck!

393
00:25:04.521 --> 00:25:06.136
- Whoa!
- Who is that, Taquito?


394
00:25:06.315 --> 00:25:07.725
No, sir.
It's Dobis.


395
00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:09.640
- It's Tim and Eric.
- Tim and Eric.


396
00:25:11.028 --> 00:25:12.188
Oh.

397
00:25:12.362 --> 00:25:14.193
- Oh. Come in.
- Thank you.


398
00:25:14.364 --> 00:25:15.774
Yeah. Come in.

399
00:25:15.949 --> 00:25:18.941
- Tim and Eric. Hello.
- Hi. Sorry to spook you.


400
00:25:19.119 --> 00:25:21.861
- Good to meet you.
- Hi. Come in.


401
00:25:22.039 --> 00:25:24.371
Hi. Hi.

402
00:25:24.541 --> 00:25:27.123
I did not expect you guys.

403
00:25:27.294 --> 00:25:30.752
I don't usually have visitors
at this time of the day.


404
00:25:30.923 --> 00:25:32.208
So thank you.

405
00:25:32.382 --> 00:25:34.043
Please, sit down.
Have a s--


406
00:25:34.218 --> 00:25:36.630
God! Come on!

407
00:25:36.804 --> 00:25:39.796
God damn it!
There's an order here.


408
00:25:39.973 --> 00:25:41.383
Sorry.

409
00:25:41.558 --> 00:25:44.220
Oh!
All this was organized.


410
00:25:44.394 --> 00:25:46.601
Now, I don't know.

411
00:25:46.772 --> 00:25:50.936
Because a couple of dicks
walked in and wrecked it.


412
00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:52.725
- Can I help you?
- No!


413
00:25:52.903 --> 00:25:55.144
Have you ever visited
an office before?


414
00:25:55.322 --> 00:25:58.780
- You want us to come back another time?
- No.


415
00:26:00.869 --> 00:26:02.450
I almost had a heart attack.

416
00:26:04.498 --> 00:26:06.079
Can we have a fresh start?

417
00:26:07.417 --> 00:26:09.658
- That'd be great.
- Hi, I'm Eric Wareheim.


418
00:26:09.837 --> 00:26:13.079
And I'm Tim Heidecker.
And we are from Dobis P.R.


419
00:26:13.257 --> 00:26:14.963
We saw your commercial,

420
00:26:15.134 --> 00:26:17.125
and we're here
to run the mall


421
00:26:17.302 --> 00:26:18.542
and make that billion.

422
00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:20.381
Do you want
to watch "Top Gun"?


423
00:26:21.723 --> 00:26:23.884
- Right now?
- I love that movie.


424
00:26:24.059 --> 00:26:26.675
- You have a copy?
- I have it here somewhere.


425
00:26:26.854 --> 00:26:29.311
There it is.
It was right here...


426
00:26:29.481 --> 00:26:30.846
- Right on top.
- ...the whole time.


427
00:26:31.024 --> 00:26:32.184
Okay. "Top Gun."

428
00:26:32.359 --> 00:26:34.099
- Just put it in here?
- Just put it right in there.


429
00:26:34.278 --> 00:26:36.360
Great.

430
00:26:36.530 --> 00:26:38.361
Does it start
from the top?


431
00:26:38.532 --> 00:26:40.443
Mm-hmm.

432
00:26:40.617 --> 00:26:41.857
"Top Gun" from the top.

433
00:26:43.871 --> 00:26:45.862
Sit back and enjoy the ride.

434
00:26:46.039 --> 00:26:48.781
- Tom Cruise, I guess.
- Mm-hmm.


435
00:26:54.089 --> 00:26:56.250
- Ah.
- Great.


436
00:26:56.425 --> 00:26:58.586
- I like that movie.
- It's a good movie.


437
00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:00.466
- Terrific.
- Wonderful. Artistic.


438
00:27:00.637 --> 00:27:03.174
Do you want
to watch it again?


439
00:27:04.433 --> 00:27:06.298
We just saw
one pass of it, so...


440
00:27:06.476 --> 00:27:08.592
We'd love to focus
in on the business.


441
00:27:08.770 --> 00:27:10.977
It literally means
the world to me.


442
00:27:12.482 --> 00:27:13.892
Come on.

443
00:27:14.067 --> 00:27:15.477
I guess we can watch it
one more time.


444
00:27:15.652 --> 00:27:16.937
Yeah.

445
00:27:17.112 --> 00:27:18.852
- Rewind here?
- Rewind.


446
00:27:20.532 --> 00:27:21.817
So while
we're rewinding,


447
00:27:21.992 --> 00:27:23.152
Iet's talk business
about the mall.


448
00:27:23.327 --> 00:27:24.567
And hit play.

449
00:27:24.745 --> 00:27:27.282
- Okay. Play again?
- Round two.


450
00:27:27.456 --> 00:27:30.289
- Play again.
- "Top Gun" from the top again.


451
00:27:30.459 --> 00:27:33.667
Sit back and enjoy the ride.

452
00:27:39.343 --> 00:27:41.504
I love that movie.
It's a great film.


453
00:27:41.678 --> 00:27:43.464
Great flying.

454
00:27:43.639 --> 00:27:45.846
Yeah.

455
00:27:46.016 --> 00:27:47.631
I love that music.

456
00:27:47.809 --> 00:27:49.345
Yeah.

457
00:27:49.519 --> 00:27:52.807
Yeah, the music is great.

458
00:27:53.941 --> 00:27:56.648
Not just the songs, either,
the score is good.


459
00:27:56.818 --> 00:27:58.854
- The motorcycles and stuff.
- Uh-huh.


460
00:27:59.029 --> 00:28:02.521
Is that Val Kilmer?
Is that Val Kilmer?


461
00:28:02.699 --> 00:28:05.156
Jesus.

462
00:28:06.536 --> 00:28:10.370
Fuck.

463
00:28:16.797 --> 00:28:19.209
All right.

464
00:28:19.383 --> 00:28:20.589
Taquito!

465
00:28:20.759 --> 00:28:22.374
Get up here right now!

466
00:28:22.552 --> 00:28:24.258
I've got some business
for you!


467
00:28:24.429 --> 00:28:26.841
I'll need to introduce
you to Taquito.


468
00:28:27.015 --> 00:28:28.846
He lives here in the mall.

469
00:28:30.185 --> 00:28:31.470
He's a sick boy.

470
00:28:31.645 --> 00:28:33.977
Hmm, sorry to hear that.

471
00:28:34.147 --> 00:28:35.478
Come here.

472
00:28:39.236 --> 00:28:41.568
He's your problem now.

473
00:28:43.031 --> 00:28:44.362
Okay.

474
00:28:47.494 --> 00:28:49.450
Also, you're going to have
to look out for the wolf.


475
00:28:50.956 --> 00:28:52.696
Is that
a metaphorical wolf?


476
00:28:52.874 --> 00:28:55.832
- Huh?
- Like an animal wolf?


477
00:28:56.003 --> 00:28:57.664
- Yeah.
- You're talking about a wolf?


478
00:28:57.838 --> 00:29:00.329
Oh, yeah.
He's a real wolf.


479
00:29:00.507 --> 00:29:02.088
He'll bite you.

480
00:29:05.053 --> 00:29:06.509
Noted. Okay.

481
00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:08.261
Well, if I could
just move on?


482
00:29:08.432 --> 00:29:11.014
One more thing. I hate to do this
to you, but in the commercial,


483
00:29:11.184 --> 00:29:12.924
you said we were gonna
make a billion dollars.


484
00:29:13.103 --> 00:29:15.435
Oh. The money's coming.

485
00:29:15.605 --> 00:29:17.596
Did you wink there?

486
00:29:17.774 --> 00:29:19.890
- Hmm?
- You just winked.


487
00:29:20.068 --> 00:29:22.354
Look. Don't worry
about the money.


488
00:29:22.529 --> 00:29:25.066
You're gonna make a billion
running this place.


489
00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:27.447
Making the money.

490
00:29:27.617 --> 00:29:28.948
Yeah, it happened again.

491
00:29:29.119 --> 00:29:30.154
I'm sorry.
We're still seeing it.


492
00:29:30.329 --> 00:29:31.819
Really?

493
00:29:31.997 --> 00:29:34.113
I find that hard to believe.

494
00:29:35.167 --> 00:29:36.623
I saw a wink.
That was a wink.


495
00:29:36.793 --> 00:29:38.533
I don't think I winked.

496
00:29:38.712 --> 00:29:41.374
Yeah. Well, we both saw it.
You winked.


497
00:29:41.548 --> 00:29:43.334
I don't know if it's some kind of
reflexive thing.


498
00:29:43.508 --> 00:29:44.497
No.

499
00:29:44.676 --> 00:29:46.257
Would you just mind
saying "Tim and Eric,


500
00:29:46.428 --> 00:29:48.840
you'll make the billion dollars,
run the mall," and there's no wink?


501
00:29:49.014 --> 00:29:52.006
I hate doing this, but could you just--
you know, even with your hands...


502
00:29:52.184 --> 00:29:53.970
- I'm happy to.
- ...just keep them open.


503
00:29:54.144 --> 00:29:56.135
Then just say "Tim and Eric
will make a billion dollars."


504
00:29:56.313 --> 00:29:58.554
No wink.

505
00:29:58.732 --> 00:30:00.768
Just say the line
and keep the eyes wide open.


506
00:30:00.942 --> 00:30:02.978
You're gonna do just fine
running this place.


507
00:30:03.153 --> 00:30:05.189
You're gonna make a billion.

508
00:30:05.364 --> 00:30:07.446
Even with them spread,
I-- we see the wink.


509
00:30:07.616 --> 00:30:09.948
I don't even know how
it's possible, but you're--


510
00:30:10.118 --> 00:30:12.450
- you're winking through it.
- Hmm.


511
00:30:12.621 --> 00:30:14.703
I think we should just
trust him on this.


512
00:30:14.873 --> 00:30:16.613
- I don't know, man.
- We don't have any other options.


513
00:30:16.792 --> 00:30:18.623
Wink or no wink, we have
to go with this. We're here.


514
00:30:18.794 --> 00:30:21.786
Okay. All right,
well, Mr. Weebs,


515
00:30:21.963 --> 00:30:23.749
we'd love to accept
the offer.


516
00:30:23.924 --> 00:30:26.506
- Oh, that's wonderful news.
- We'll run your mall.


517
00:30:26.676 --> 00:30:28.632
Great news.

518
00:30:28.804 --> 00:30:30.135
Yes, Uncle Damian?
What is it?


519
00:30:30.305 --> 00:30:31.511
Taquito!

520
00:30:33.558 --> 00:30:36.550
These are Tim and Eric.

521
00:30:36.728 --> 00:30:38.764
Oh, how nice.

522
00:30:38.939 --> 00:30:41.305
They will be running
the mall from now on.


523
00:30:41.483 --> 00:30:44.441
- You take orders from them.
- Yes, Uncle Damian.


524
00:30:44.611 --> 00:30:46.397
Want to see where I live?

525
00:30:46.571 --> 00:30:48.857
Want to know where to get food?

526
00:30:49.032 --> 00:30:50.488
Taquito!

527
00:30:50.659 --> 00:30:53.366
You do the song
like we practiced.


528
00:30:53.537 --> 00:30:56.620
Yes, Uncle Damian.

529
00:30:56.790 --> 00:30:59.452

538
00:31:21.606 --> 00:31:24.268
- You okay?
- I'll be all right.


539
00:31:24.443 --> 00:31:26.229
It's just the shivers.

540
00:31:28.447 --> 00:31:30.654
My body's hot,
but I feel cold.


541
00:31:32.159 --> 00:31:35.071
Mr. Weebs?

542
00:31:39.791 --> 00:31:43.079
Tonight's movie features
several important lessons.


543
00:31:43.253 --> 00:31:46.290
The following segments
are meant to reinforce these themes.


544
00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:54.511
You wanted to see me?

545
00:31:54.681 --> 00:31:56.763
Yes.
You're fired.


546
00:31:56.933 --> 00:31:59.800
Oh, no!

547
00:31:59.978 --> 00:32:01.809
Why? Why?

548
00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:04.096
That's it.
Let it all out.


549
00:32:04.274 --> 00:32:06.890
Oh, no.

550
00:32:07.068 --> 00:32:09.980
This is the best
business scenario for us.


551
00:32:10.155 --> 00:32:11.440
It had to be done.

552
00:32:11.615 --> 00:32:13.776
Yes, you are right.

553
00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:15.486
I understand that now.

554
00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:18.527
Thank you.
Good-bye.


555
00:32:18.705 --> 00:32:19.990
Psst. Wait.

556
00:32:20.165 --> 00:32:21.701
Come back.

557
00:32:21.875 --> 00:32:23.911
This is your
severance package.


558
00:32:46.191 --> 00:32:49.900
Sweet old Mrs. Wareheim.
Mrs. Heidecker.


559
00:32:50.070 --> 00:32:51.651
Yes.

560
00:32:51.821 --> 00:32:54.153
You must be so proud
of your boys.


561
00:32:54.324 --> 00:32:56.440
Making a big
Hollywood movie.


562
00:32:56.618 --> 00:32:58.483
Aren't you?

563
00:32:58.662 --> 00:33:01.529
The sets,
the movie stars.


564
00:33:01.706 --> 00:33:04.994
Geez Louise,
it's something, isn't it?


565
00:33:06.336 --> 00:33:08.668
Well, you see,
the problem is


566
00:33:08.838 --> 00:33:12.456
that they
screwed up big-time.


567
00:33:12.634 --> 00:33:14.499
They screwed up, mommies.

568
00:33:14.678 --> 00:33:16.418
Oh, no.

569
00:33:18.932 --> 00:33:21.048
Are you scared?

570
00:33:21.226 --> 00:33:23.763
- Hmm?
- Scared?


571
00:33:23.937 --> 00:33:25.268
Where's your son?

572
00:33:25.438 --> 00:33:27.178
I don't know.

573
00:33:27.357 --> 00:33:28.722
Where are your sons?

574
00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:30.436
I wish I could help you,
but I can't. Sorry.


575
00:33:30.610 --> 00:33:34.319
Where are your sons?
Where are your sons?


576
00:33:34.489 --> 00:33:35.695
Where is he?

577
00:33:37.325 --> 00:33:39.486
Earle.
Let me try.


578
00:33:43.748 --> 00:33:47.036
You've got Zaffer's Music
over there on the right.


579
00:33:47.210 --> 00:33:51.044
Ahem. And that's
Dan's Tiny Baby Outlet.


580
00:33:51.214 --> 00:33:53.876
He's only open
two days a week.


581
00:33:54.050 --> 00:33:57.087
And this here
is Drimble's Yogurt.


582
00:33:57.262 --> 00:33:59.469
Some folks
say it's haunted


583
00:33:59.639 --> 00:34:01.755
by the yogurt man.

584
00:34:01.933 --> 00:34:03.798
I don't know.

585
00:34:03.977 --> 00:34:06.559
I wouldn't change
too much around here.


586
00:34:06.730 --> 00:34:09.267
The yogurt man might
get real upset.


587
00:34:09.441 --> 00:34:11.523
That's a bobo.

588
00:34:11.693 --> 00:34:14.230
How are you?

589
00:34:14.404 --> 00:34:15.985
Hi.

590
00:34:16.156 --> 00:34:18.238
And this is Simon's.

591
00:34:18.408 --> 00:34:20.865
They sell things
for mommies and daddies.


592
00:34:21.036 --> 00:34:23.994
Oh, hey, Eric,
check it out. Swords.


593
00:34:24.164 --> 00:34:26.155
Cool, I love swords.

594
00:34:28.585 --> 00:34:30.746
Mr. Bishopman?

595
00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:33.081
I have a couple of fellas
who wanted to meet you.


596
00:34:33.256 --> 00:34:34.871
What's this? What do you want?
We're closing.


597
00:34:35.050 --> 00:34:36.631
I'm Tim Heidecker.

598
00:34:36.801 --> 00:34:39.042
I'm Eric Wareheim,
and we're from Dobis P.R.,


599
00:34:39.220 --> 00:34:40.460
and we're here
to take over your mall.


600
00:34:40.639 --> 00:34:41.970
That's right, Mr. Bishopman.

601
00:34:42.140 --> 00:34:43.721
We are here to reimagine
what this mall can be,


602
00:34:43.892 --> 00:34:46.349
and, in fact, we got some pretty big
and exciting changes in mind.


603
00:34:46.519 --> 00:34:47.634
Mm-hmm.

604
00:34:47.812 --> 00:34:49.018
So just hand over
your cost report,


605
00:34:49.189 --> 00:34:51.350
and we'll get started on
some business plans for you.


606
00:34:51.524 --> 00:34:53.480
You listen to me.

607
00:34:53.652 --> 00:34:56.359
I'm Allen
fucking Bishopman,


608
00:34:56.529 --> 00:34:58.611
and I've run E Z Swords
for 15 years.


609
00:34:58.782 --> 00:35:00.647
And you want me to change?

610
00:35:00.825 --> 00:35:02.156
Fuck you!

611
00:35:02.327 --> 00:35:04.158
Sir, Dobis is here
to help, okay?


612
00:35:04.329 --> 00:35:05.990
I like things this way.

613
00:35:06.164 --> 00:35:07.745
I don't want things
to change!


614
00:35:07.916 --> 00:35:09.031
Okay.

615
00:35:09.209 --> 00:35:11.074
I sell two swords a year,
I'm good.


616
00:35:11.252 --> 00:35:13.959
I sell no swords a year,
and I'm even better.


617
00:35:14.130 --> 00:35:16.917
You see, S'wallow Valley
wants to keep swords off the streets,


618
00:35:17.092 --> 00:35:20.630
and they pay me a monthly fee
to not sell any swords!


619
00:35:20.804 --> 00:35:21.839
Okay.
I didn't know that.


620
00:35:22.013 --> 00:35:25.255
Well, now you do, you shit!

621
00:35:25.433 --> 00:35:26.969
Okay. Well, we didn't
know that. So...


622
00:35:27.143 --> 00:35:30.260
Well, now you do,
you shit!


623
00:35:30.438 --> 00:35:32.053
Well, we weren't aware.
I'm sorry.


624
00:35:32.232 --> 00:35:36.316
Well, now you do,
you piece of shit.


625
00:35:36.486 --> 00:35:39.444
I got a lot of stuff
going around in my head.


626
00:35:39.614 --> 00:35:41.024
I've got to sort it out,

627
00:35:41.199 --> 00:35:42.689
and it will help
to not have you


628
00:35:42.867 --> 00:35:45.074
right in my fucking face
the whole time!


629
00:35:45.245 --> 00:35:47.361
Well, we look forward to doing
business with you, sir.


630
00:35:47.539 --> 00:35:50.702
Yes. All the best.

631
00:35:53.128 --> 00:35:54.914
Good night.

632
00:35:58.133 --> 00:36:00.749
Anyways, there's a lot
of other fun stuff


633
00:36:00.927 --> 00:36:03.213
I'll show you tomorrow.

634
00:36:03.388 --> 00:36:06.004
Well, here we are.
Here's my humble abode


635
00:36:06.182 --> 00:36:09.140
and your temporary home
away from home.


636
00:36:10.687 --> 00:36:12.518
Okay. Careful.

637
00:36:15.358 --> 00:36:17.474
This is my secret tunnel.

638
00:36:23.908 --> 00:36:25.944
Well, here's
the living room.


639
00:36:26.119 --> 00:36:28.485
Shut the fuck up, you little cunt!

640
00:36:28.663 --> 00:36:30.199
That's Roy.

641
00:36:30.373 --> 00:36:33.331
Don't look him in the eye.

642
00:36:33.501 --> 00:36:35.116
Hello.

643
00:36:36.379 --> 00:36:39.166
- Get the fuck out of here!
- Ah!


644
00:36:41.301 --> 00:36:44.384
Here we are.

645
00:36:44.554 --> 00:36:47.091
This is my little palace.

646
00:36:47.265 --> 00:36:49.221
This is where I sleep.

647
00:36:53.271 --> 00:36:55.182
If you have to do
your business.


648
00:36:56.941 --> 00:36:59.227
There's no curtain.
You just close your eyes.


649
00:36:59.402 --> 00:37:01.063
If you have to do any work

650
00:37:01.237 --> 00:37:03.353
or any kind
of calculations,


651
00:37:03.531 --> 00:37:05.817
you can--

652
00:37:05.992 --> 00:37:08.984
you can use
this machine I built.


653
00:37:09.162 --> 00:37:11.073
It's called the--

654
00:37:11.247 --> 00:37:14.410
it's called the taqutor.

655
00:37:14.584 --> 00:37:15.573
Eric's our numbers
man here.


656
00:37:15.752 --> 00:37:17.333
I'm more of a managerial
type for Dobis.


657
00:37:17.504 --> 00:37:18.710
Really looking forward
to crunching some numbers


658
00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:20.040
on that taqutor, Taquito.

659
00:37:20.215 --> 00:37:23.753
Oh, yeah.
You must be hungry.


660
00:37:23.927 --> 00:37:26.714
- We're fine.
- Here. Have a taquito.


661
00:37:26.888 --> 00:37:29.095
Ooh.
No, thanks.


662
00:37:29.265 --> 00:37:31.426
You've got to keep those
refrigerated, Taquito.


663
00:37:31.601 --> 00:37:33.842
I know. That's why
I only eat the middle.


664
00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:36.102
Taquito, don't put that
in your mouth, please.


665
00:37:47.575 --> 00:37:49.111
Taquito,
is everything all right?


666
00:37:49.285 --> 00:37:52.402
It's only blood.
It's just natural.


667
00:37:54.374 --> 00:37:56.706
I'm not meant to live long.

668
00:37:58.461 --> 00:37:59.826
Poor boy.

669
00:38:00.964 --> 00:38:02.249
All right.
Well, on that note,


670
00:38:02.423 --> 00:38:03.754
we should probably
hit the hay.


671
00:38:03.925 --> 00:38:05.290
Okay.

672
00:38:05.468 --> 00:38:08.255
- So--
- We can sleep right back there?


673
00:38:08.429 --> 00:38:09.760
Yep.

674
00:38:10.765 --> 00:38:13.006
- Good night.
- Sweet dreams.


675
00:38:15.478 --> 00:38:17.685
Good night, Taquito.

676
00:38:17.856 --> 00:38:19.392
Good night.

677
00:38:20.984 --> 00:38:23.100
Yeah, awfully nice to have some company.

678
00:38:23.278 --> 00:38:24.609
Thanks, Taquito.

679
00:38:25.738 --> 00:38:26.853
Thank you.

Hello, people of
S'wallow Mall.


701
00:40:03.503 --> 00:40:06.370
Let's give a real big
warm welcome


702
00:40:06.547 --> 00:40:09.710
to our presidents
of Dobis P.R.--


703
00:40:09.884 --> 00:40:12.591
Tim and Eric!

704
00:40:14.138 --> 00:40:17.050
- Hey.
- Hey, everybody.


705
00:40:17.225 --> 00:40:18.465
Awesome.

706
00:40:18.643 --> 00:40:20.508
What is up,
party people?


707
00:40:20.687 --> 00:40:22.552
Thank you.

708
00:40:22.730 --> 00:40:24.561
I'm Tim Heidecker.
This is Eric Wareheim.


709
00:40:24.732 --> 00:40:26.268
We are Dobis P.R.,

710
00:40:26.442 --> 00:40:28.603
and we're here to tell you
about our plan


711
00:40:28.778 --> 00:40:30.188
to revitalize
the S'wallow Valley Mall.


712
00:40:30.363 --> 00:40:32.069
Boo!

713
00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:34.231
And here's how we're
gonna do it, guys.


714
00:40:34.409 --> 00:40:37.401
We're gonna use the three
keys to success.


715
00:40:37.578 --> 00:40:40.069
The first key to success.

716
00:40:40.248 --> 00:40:42.830
We gotta get rid
of that wolf...


717
00:40:50.091 --> 00:40:51.331
That wolf.

718
00:40:51.509 --> 00:40:53.170
Okay, our second
key to success


719
00:40:53.344 --> 00:40:55.551
is we've got to clean
this mall up.


720
00:40:55.722 --> 00:40:58.179
All right? We've got to put a fresh coat
of paint on things.


721
00:40:58.349 --> 00:40:59.509
We've gotta get rid
of all you squatters.


722
00:40:59.684 --> 00:41:02.016
The third key to success

723
00:41:02.186 --> 00:41:04.222
is to prepare
for the grand re-opening


724
00:41:04.397 --> 00:41:06.479
of the new
S'wallow Valley Mall.


725
00:41:06.649 --> 00:41:08.765
We've got to get rid of
the stores that don't work


726
00:41:08.943 --> 00:41:10.399
and bring in stores
that do work,


727
00:41:10.570 --> 00:41:11.810
that make profits.

728
00:41:11.988 --> 00:41:13.569
That's gonna do it
for us, guys.


729
00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:15.947
And we're gonna be
making our billion.


730
00:41:16.117 --> 00:41:17.232
You got that right.

731
00:41:17.410 --> 00:41:18.650
I do want to add
a small caveat here.


732
00:41:18.828 --> 00:41:21.490
We have absolutely
no experience doing this kind of stuff.


733
00:41:21.664 --> 00:41:24.622
Absolutely not, guys.
We are Hollywood actors.


734
00:41:24.792 --> 00:41:26.783
Okay?
That's our specialty.


735
00:41:26.961 --> 00:41:30.795
Re-opening a shit-hole mall?
It's not what we do.


736
00:41:30.965 --> 00:41:32.580
Yeah. We just want
to go on record here


737
00:41:32.759 --> 00:41:34.590
so nobody can come back
and this can't bite us in the ass


738
00:41:34.761 --> 00:41:36.342
that we didn't know what we
were doing here, okay?


739
00:41:36.512 --> 00:41:38.423
When I look in your face,
sir, I say to myself,


740
00:41:38.598 --> 00:41:40.429
I wish I stayed in Hollywood

741
00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:42.932
and just stayed
a superstar actor.


742
00:41:43.102 --> 00:41:45.138
What the fuck
am I doing down here


743
00:41:45.313 --> 00:41:47.554
doing business
in this shit-hole mall?


744
00:41:47.732 --> 00:41:50.144
- But that's Dobis.
- That's the pride of Dobis.


745
00:41:50.318 --> 00:41:52.309
Get used to it 'cause this place
is gonna change.


746
00:41:52.487 --> 00:41:54.148
Oh, yeah!

747
00:41:57.366 --> 00:41:59.231
Come on, everybody!
Say Dobis!


748
00:41:59.410 --> 00:42:01.366
- Dobis!
- Dobis!


749
00:42:01.537 --> 00:42:04.495
Talk about it, Mama:
Dobis in the house.


750
00:42:04.665 --> 00:42:07.873
- Dobis!
- Dobis!


751
00:42:08.044 --> 00:42:09.204
Dobis!

752
00:42:15.843 --> 00:42:18.334
Got you just
where I want you.


753
00:42:18.513 --> 00:42:20.925
There you are.

754
00:42:21.099 --> 00:42:23.511
Oh, you guys
are going down.


755
00:42:23.684 --> 00:42:25.140
Excuse me. I was wondering
about this sword.


756
00:42:25.311 --> 00:42:28.098
Hang on. Can't you see
I'm on the fucking phone?


757
00:42:28.272 --> 00:42:29.637
Operator.

758
00:42:29.816 --> 00:42:31.602
Yes.
Hello, operator.


759
00:42:31.776 --> 00:42:34.313
I need the number for
the Schlaaang Corporation.


760
00:42:34.487 --> 00:42:36.728
I have some information
they're gonna want to hear.


761
00:42:36.906 --> 00:42:38.237
Let me give you their
customer service--


762
00:42:38.407 --> 00:42:40.068
No, I don't want customer
service, you stupid bitch.


763
00:42:40.243 --> 00:42:43.076
I want you to put me through
to headquarters, goddamn it.


764
00:42:43.246 --> 00:42:45.578
H-hello?

765
00:42:45.748 --> 00:42:48.239
Oh, she hung up. Great.
She hung up.


766
00:42:48.417 --> 00:42:49.998
What the hell do you want?

767
00:42:51.546 --> 00:42:53.207
Oh, you're just holding
a knife out like I know--


768
00:42:53.381 --> 00:42:55.337
Oh, I know
what to do with that.


769
00:42:55.508 --> 00:42:56.748
I just want to see how
much this sword was.


770
00:42:56.926 --> 00:42:59.963
Get the hell out
of my store.


771
00:43:18.531 --> 00:43:19.987
Official Dobis reps here,

772
00:43:20.158 --> 00:43:21.898
stopping in
for a meet-and-greet.


773
00:43:23.369 --> 00:43:26.452
Hi, welcome to Reggie's.
What can I get for you?


774
00:43:26.622 --> 00:43:28.078
We've got a sale
on slightly soiled.


775
00:43:28.249 --> 00:43:29.785
No, no, no.
We're not customers.


776
00:43:29.959 --> 00:43:31.540
I don't know if you saw our presentation
we did the other day,


777
00:43:31.711 --> 00:43:34.453
but we're running things
here at the mall now.


778
00:43:34.630 --> 00:43:36.291
What exactly do you
sell here, Reggie?


779
00:43:36.465 --> 00:43:38.205
Oh, used toilet paper,
of course.


780
00:43:38.384 --> 00:43:41.217
There's a lot of demand
for that here, then, Reg?


781
00:43:41.387 --> 00:43:43.093
It's more of
a gourmet operation.


782
00:43:43.264 --> 00:43:44.720
Okay.
Write down gourm--


783
00:43:44.891 --> 00:43:46.631
I got it. G
-I--

784
00:43:46.809 --> 00:43:48.549
No,
G-O-R-M-A-Y.


785
00:43:48.728 --> 00:43:50.184
G
-O
-R...

786
00:43:50.354 --> 00:43:52.310
- M-A-Y.
- M-A-Y.


787
00:43:54.192 --> 00:43:58.401
Yep. Uh, every night, we go
out to the usual spots--


788
00:43:58.571 --> 00:44:01.153
you know, abandoned
port-a-potties, sewage mains,


789
00:44:01.324 --> 00:44:03.315
those kind of places--
and we do our collecting.


790
00:44:03.492 --> 00:44:05.904
And then we take
the messy slop back here,


791
00:44:06.078 --> 00:44:08.160
and we spool it all
onto new rolls.


792
00:44:08.331 --> 00:44:10.617
What's that? Shit?

793
00:44:11.667 --> 00:44:14.033
It's a shit smell.
Is that you?


794
00:44:14.212 --> 00:44:15.622
It smells like po-po.

795
00:44:15.796 --> 00:44:18.663
My father taught me this
profession years ago.


796
00:44:18.841 --> 00:44:20.547
And now I'm teaching
it to my son.


797
00:44:20.718 --> 00:44:23.801
- Good.
- Speak of the devil.


798
00:44:25.264 --> 00:44:26.629
Come on.

799
00:44:28.851 --> 00:44:30.091
This is Jeffrey.

800
00:44:30.269 --> 00:44:32.726
- Say hello.
- Hi.


801
00:44:32.897 --> 00:44:34.387
Hello.

802
00:44:35.608 --> 00:44:37.064
Where have you been
hiding this boy?


803
00:44:37.235 --> 00:44:39.851
- That's not a bad boy.
- Come here.


804
00:44:40.029 --> 00:44:41.485
Let me feast my eyes
on that boy.


805
00:44:41.656 --> 00:44:43.271
Come here. Yeah.

806
00:44:43.449 --> 00:44:45.531
Take a look at you.

807
00:44:45.701 --> 00:44:47.032
Hey.

808
00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:49.280
Look at the size of him.

809
00:44:49.455 --> 00:44:51.116
Look at this.

810
00:44:51.290 --> 00:44:53.576
Hmm.

811
00:44:53.751 --> 00:44:55.207
Let me see your mouth.

812
00:44:55.378 --> 00:44:56.538
Nice. Nice teeth.

813
00:44:56.712 --> 00:44:59.920
You want to sit
on Uncle Tim's lap?


814
00:45:00.091 --> 00:45:02.127
Get on my knee.

815
00:45:02.301 --> 00:45:04.257
I like your son a lot.

816
00:45:04.428 --> 00:45:06.089
All right,
all right, Tim.


817
00:45:06.264 --> 00:45:08.255
Listen, Reggie, after
a few calculations here,


818
00:45:08.432 --> 00:45:11.219
it looks like your store isn't quite fit
for the new Dobis brand.


819
00:45:11.394 --> 00:45:13.635
Sorry, Reg. We're gonna
have to shut this boy down.


820
00:45:14.814 --> 00:45:16.224
It's been in
the family for years.


821
00:45:16.399 --> 00:45:19.562
The new S'wallow Valley Mall
is about fresh, clean, safe--


822
00:45:19.735 --> 00:45:21.020
You know what, Tim?

823
00:45:21.195 --> 00:45:23.231
There's an opening
for head of janitorial,


824
00:45:23.406 --> 00:45:25.237
and I don't know
Reggie's qualifications,


825
00:45:25.408 --> 00:45:26.739
but I feel like we could
give him a shot.


826
00:45:26.909 --> 00:45:28.319
What do you think?

827
00:45:28.494 --> 00:45:29.950
Uh, well...

828
00:45:30.121 --> 00:45:31.452
You do the dust.
You do the shine.


829
00:45:31.622 --> 00:45:33.112
We make a mess,
you clean it up.


830
00:45:33.291 --> 00:45:35.953
- That's the job.
- Okay.


831
00:45:36.127 --> 00:45:37.742
Great. Well, Reg,

832
00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:40.036
it sounds like you're gonna be pretty
busy over the next few weeks.


833
00:45:40.214 --> 00:45:41.875
Jeffrey, how about you
tag along with us?


834
00:45:42.049 --> 00:45:43.164
And I can teach you
a little bit about


835
00:45:43.342 --> 00:45:45.333
what it's like to be
a businessman around here,


836
00:45:45.511 --> 00:45:47.172
what it's like
to be a real man.


837
00:45:47.346 --> 00:45:50.964
What it's like to be a real
successful businessman.


838
00:45:51.142 --> 00:45:52.348
Huh? Sound good?

839
00:45:52.518 --> 00:45:54.474
- Yes, sir.
- Don't call me sir.


840
00:45:54.645 --> 00:45:56.852
Why don't you call me Daddy?
Say "Yes, Daddy."


841
00:45:57.023 --> 00:45:58.308
Yes, Daddy.

842
00:45:58.482 --> 00:46:00.768
Does that sound good
to you, Uncle Reg?


843
00:46:00.943 --> 00:46:03.184
Yeah. Okay.

844
00:46:03.362 --> 00:46:06.525
Are you gonna be my son?
That's what I thought.


845
00:46:41.484 --> 00:46:42.849
Attention, squatters.

846
00:46:43.027 --> 00:46:44.483
This is your final warning.

847
00:46:44.653 --> 00:46:46.860
Please vacate the mall
immediately.


848
00:46:47.031 --> 00:46:50.068
This is a direct order
from Dobis P.R.


849
00:46:53.496 --> 00:46:54.781
Get out of here.

850
00:47:15.059 --> 00:47:16.640
Swing, swing, swing.
Swing, swing.


851
00:47:16.811 --> 00:47:17.846
Oh, shit.

852
00:47:18.020 --> 00:47:19.226
You got, like,
a foot back here


853
00:47:19.397 --> 00:47:20.728
if you swing it
hard enough.


854
00:47:21.732 --> 00:47:23.848
I got it.
I got it.


855
00:47:24.026 --> 00:47:26.108
Back it up.

856
00:47:28.781 --> 00:47:30.737
Get out and push.
Get out and push.


857
00:47:37.039 --> 00:47:39.997
Hey! I'm trying
to work in here.


858
00:47:44.463 --> 00:47:46.670
All right. Shrim Alternative
Healing Center.


859
00:47:46.841 --> 00:47:48.422
It looks like they have
a video here, guys.


860
00:47:48.592 --> 00:47:50.708
You want to watch a movie, son?

861
00:47:50.886 --> 00:47:51.966
Good day.

862
00:47:52.138 --> 00:47:53.469
I'm Dr. Doone Strutts.

863
00:47:53.639 --> 00:47:55.550
And I want to thank you
for choosing


864
00:47:55.724 --> 00:47:57.965
the Shrim Alternative
Healing Center.


865
00:47:58.144 --> 00:47:59.725
Shrim.

866
00:47:59.895 --> 00:48:01.886
Shrim can
help you achieve


867
00:48:02.064 --> 00:48:03.770
premium body health.

868
00:48:03.941 --> 00:48:06.603
Shrim.

869
00:48:10.114 --> 00:48:11.229
Ooh.

870
00:48:11.407 --> 00:48:14.149
You must locate
your inner shrim.


871
00:48:14.326 --> 00:48:16.863
Shrim begin.

872
00:48:19.748 --> 00:48:21.613
I will help you
find your shrim,


873
00:48:21.792 --> 00:48:23.248
along with my sons.

874
00:48:23.419 --> 00:48:26.536
- Shrim!
- Shrim!


875
00:48:26.714 --> 00:48:29.046
Shrim.

876
00:48:30.843 --> 00:48:33.459
Shrim!

877
00:48:35.055 --> 00:48:38.172
Shrim!

878
00:48:38.350 --> 00:48:39.965
I'd really like to get
my shrim tested,


879
00:48:40.144 --> 00:48:41.429
meet Dr. Doone.

880
00:48:41.604 --> 00:48:43.686
Shrim.
Sounds like shrimp.


881
00:48:43.856 --> 00:48:45.972
Shrimp sounds like Shemp.

882
00:48:46.150 --> 00:48:49.438
Shrim. We should get
some shrimp for dinner.


883
00:48:49.612 --> 00:48:50.727
What?

884
00:48:50.905 --> 00:48:52.145
Shrim! Shrim! Shrim!

885
00:48:52.323 --> 00:48:54.860
Shrim!

886
00:49:02.958 --> 00:49:05.665
All right, Katie's
Celebrity Balloons is our last stop.


887
00:49:05.836 --> 00:49:07.201
Looks like no one's home.
We can turn around.


888
00:49:07.379 --> 00:49:08.664
- No.
- Let's go back.


889
00:49:08.839 --> 00:49:10.955
Just play it cool.
Play it just like yourself.


890
00:49:11.133 --> 00:49:14.045
Just be natural.
Don't forget we're here for business.


891
00:49:14.220 --> 00:49:15.551
Let's do it.

892
00:49:18.224 --> 00:49:21.591
Jeffrey, stick with me.
Play with the balloons.


893
00:49:21.769 --> 00:49:23.930
Hello. Hi.
Tim and Eric here.


894
00:49:24.104 --> 00:49:27.346
- Oh, hi there.
- Hi, I'm Tim Heideck--


895
00:49:27.525 --> 00:49:29.311
Hey,
I'm Eric Wareheim.


896
00:49:29.485 --> 00:49:32.522
Businessmen here.
I'm so nervous.


897
00:49:32.696 --> 00:49:33.776
So, um, love you.

898
00:49:33.948 --> 00:49:35.438
- No.
- No?


899
00:49:35.616 --> 00:49:37.481
Just be yourself.

900
00:49:37.660 --> 00:49:39.366
Hi. Eric Wareheim.
I love you.


901
00:49:39.537 --> 00:49:41.744
- Mm. Start again. Pardon us.
- One, two, three.


902
00:49:41.914 --> 00:49:43.996
Hi, I'm Eric Wareheim.
Very in love with you--


903
00:49:44.166 --> 00:49:45.406
- Okay.
- This is business.


904
00:49:45.584 --> 00:49:47.495
I'm trying to just say
the business thing.


905
00:49:47.670 --> 00:49:48.750
We won't be able
to use any of that.


906
00:49:48.921 --> 00:49:50.786
- Cut the love?
- Yeah.


907
00:49:50.965 --> 00:49:53.422
Hi, I'm Eric Wareheim.
We're here from Dobis.


908
00:49:53.592 --> 00:49:55.253
We're evaluating
your balloon stand.


909
00:49:55.427 --> 00:49:56.963
And I love you so much.

910
00:49:57.137 --> 00:49:59.128
All right.
Why don't you take two?


911
00:49:59.306 --> 00:50:02.048
Tsst. Tsst.

912
00:50:02.226 --> 00:50:05.184
Take five. I'll get this.
Hi. We're Dobis.


913
00:50:05.354 --> 00:50:07.686
We're just walking around,
trying to get a lay of the land,


914
00:50:07.856 --> 00:50:10.142
figuring out what you guys
need, how we can make this mall better.


915
00:50:10.317 --> 00:50:12.478
Oh. I was in
the audience.


916
00:50:12.653 --> 00:50:15.565
I saw your presentation.
You were wonderful.


917
00:50:15.739 --> 00:50:18.071
Thank you for coming
all this way to help us.


918
00:50:18.242 --> 00:50:21.109
These are super cool.
How do you even make them?


919
00:50:21.287 --> 00:50:22.618
Oh, thank you.

920
00:50:22.788 --> 00:50:24.153
Eric. Eric.

921
00:50:28.752 --> 00:50:33.121
Uh, so, Katie, I would love to schedule
an official Dobis dinner


922
00:50:33.299 --> 00:50:34.709
to discuss
your business model


923
00:50:34.883 --> 00:50:37.044
for your
balloon store here.


924
00:50:37.219 --> 00:50:39.585
With both of you?
That would be great.


925
00:50:39.763 --> 00:50:41.628
Um, or just me.

926
00:50:41.807 --> 00:50:43.763
Um, Tim will probably
be busy with his son,


927
00:50:43.934 --> 00:50:45.970
so you and I can just kind
of go over all the details.


928
00:50:46.145 --> 00:50:48.101
Friday's no good.
Jeff's got a lot of homework.


929
00:50:48.272 --> 00:50:49.682
We're gonna
concentrate on that.


930
00:50:49.857 --> 00:50:52.098
Oh. Okay, fine.

931
00:50:52.276 --> 00:50:54.358
Oh, yeah.

932
00:50:54.528 --> 00:50:56.860
Hey, Eric.

933
00:51:08.292 --> 00:51:09.953
Jeffrey!

934
00:51:12.963 --> 00:51:14.078
Jeff?

935
00:51:17.885 --> 00:51:19.216
I miss you, son.

936
00:51:31.315 --> 00:51:32.930
What are you working on
over there, bud?


937
00:51:33.108 --> 00:51:35.224
I'm just crunching some numbers
with the taqutor here,


938
00:51:35.402 --> 00:51:37.438
and we got a problem.

939
00:51:37.613 --> 00:51:38.978
What are you
talking about?


940
00:51:39.156 --> 00:51:40.692
Come take a look at this.

941
00:51:42.326 --> 00:51:43.486
Taqutor,

942
00:51:43.661 --> 00:51:45.492
Ioad up the Dobis
presentation, please.


943
00:51:45.663 --> 00:51:47.654
See what I'm saying?
It doesn't add up.


944
00:51:47.831 --> 00:51:49.867
Eric, it's probably just
a bug in the mainframe.


945
00:51:50.042 --> 00:51:51.703
I'll have Jeffrey
run a diagnostic.


946
00:51:51.877 --> 00:51:53.367
We'll get it sorted out.
It's nothing to worry about.


947
00:51:53.545 --> 00:51:55.331
No. There's nothing wrong
with the taqutor, man.


948
00:51:55.506 --> 00:51:58.464
The numbers are right here.
There's no way we're making that bil.


949
00:51:58.634 --> 00:52:00.670
What are you saying?
That Weebs lied to us?


950
00:52:00.844 --> 00:52:02.800
You know how stupid
that sounds?


951
00:52:02.971 --> 00:52:04.552
You know
what your problem is?


952
00:52:04.723 --> 00:52:07.965
Your head's in the clouds
thinking about Katie all the time.


953
00:52:08.143 --> 00:52:09.178
Let me ask you something.

954
00:52:09.353 --> 00:52:12.265
How many times did you
masturbate to her today?


955
00:52:12.439 --> 00:52:13.975
Like five or six.

956
00:52:14.149 --> 00:52:15.309
Five or six times,

957
00:52:15.484 --> 00:52:16.940
when you should have been
focused on the prize.


958
00:52:17.111 --> 00:52:18.521
You should be
focused on this:


959
00:52:18.696 --> 00:52:20.402
opening up the S'wallow
Valley Mall,


960
00:52:20.572 --> 00:52:23.279
making the "mooney," okay?
Not some dumb slut.


961
00:52:23.450 --> 00:52:25.532
Hey!

962
00:52:25.703 --> 00:52:28.570
Say what you want about my
calculations in the taqutor,


963
00:52:28.747 --> 00:52:30.203
but leave Katie
out of this.


964
00:52:50.728 --> 00:52:52.218
May I have a bite
of your apple?


965
00:53:02.614 --> 00:53:05.071
I wish I had
a bigger bite.


966
00:53:05.242 --> 00:53:08.609
That bite was all mine
because I worked hard for it.


967
00:53:08.787 --> 00:53:11.449
Yep. I didn't
deserve that bite.


968
00:53:11.623 --> 00:53:13.784
I should have
worked harder.


969
00:53:20.048 --> 00:53:23.961
Oh, ladies, ladies, ladies.

970
00:53:25.971 --> 00:53:29.429
I'm a successful
businessman, ladies.


971
00:53:29.600 --> 00:53:33.434
I built the Schlaaang empire
from the ground up.


972
00:53:33.604 --> 00:53:37.597
And if you think two idiots
can make a fool of me,


973
00:53:37.775 --> 00:53:41.108
then you've got a lot
to learn about business


974
00:53:41.278 --> 00:53:42.939
and the Schlaaang way.

975
00:53:45.073 --> 00:53:46.358
Yes.

976
00:53:46.533 --> 00:53:48.444
I've had you here for days,

977
00:53:48.619 --> 00:53:51.110
and you've given me nothing.

978
00:53:51.288 --> 00:53:53.870
Cornell, could you untie
Mrs. Wareheim, please?


979
00:54:00.464 --> 00:54:01.920
Yes.

980
00:54:02.090 --> 00:54:04.547
You see this?

981
00:54:04.718 --> 00:54:06.504
It's a letter opener.

982
00:54:07.971 --> 00:54:09.461
It was my grandpop's.

983
00:54:09.640 --> 00:54:12.427
Beautiful.

984
00:54:12.601 --> 00:54:16.310
He must have used it to open up
thousands of letters over the years,


985
00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:20.974
but it also settled
more than a few arguments.


986
00:54:23.946 --> 00:54:26.528
Do you want
to lose a finger, too?


987
00:54:26.698 --> 00:54:27.687
Where are your sons?

988
00:54:27.866 --> 00:54:29.822
I wish I could tell you
what you need to know


989
00:54:29.993 --> 00:54:31.733
if it would get your
billion dollars back to you.


990
00:54:31.912 --> 00:54:34.574
But I just don't think I know
where they did get to.


991
00:54:35.999 --> 00:54:39.491
Motherfucking Tim and Eric,
where did you go?


992
00:54:43.674 --> 00:54:45.630
♪ You are my son ♪

993
00:54:46.844 --> 00:54:49.836
♪ You're better
than anyone ♪


994
00:54:50.013 --> 00:54:53.005
♪ You're just like
a shiny new toy ♪


995
00:54:53.183 --> 00:54:55.469
♪ You are my boy ♪

996
00:54:56.979 --> 00:54:59.846
♪ You are my son ♪

997
00:55:00.023 --> 00:55:01.513
♪ You're better
than anyone. ♪


998
00:55:01.692 --> 00:55:04.604
- Ahem. Excuse me.
- What?


999
00:55:04.778 --> 00:55:06.860
Sorry to interrupt, but do you want to
get back to Dobis?


1000
00:55:07.030 --> 00:55:08.941
Or do you want
to continue singing?


1001
00:55:09.116 --> 00:55:11.983
Yeah. It's fine.
Just got lost in my music.


1002
00:55:12.160 --> 00:55:14.902
Well, we've got
Drimble's Yogurt here.


1003
00:55:15.080 --> 00:55:17.446
Uh, looks like the power's
been off for years,


1004
00:55:17.624 --> 00:55:19.990
so we got a lot of spoiled
yogurt we gotta deal with.


1005
00:55:20.168 --> 00:55:22.534
And, as you recall, Taquito
gave us a little intel


1006
00:55:22.713 --> 00:55:25.796
about a so-called yogurt man
that's haunting the premises.


1007
00:55:25.966 --> 00:55:27.331
So Dobo better investigo.

1008
00:55:27.509 --> 00:55:29.545
Well, if there is a yogurt man
in there, Eric,


1009
00:55:29.720 --> 00:55:31.961
then today he's getting
his eviction notice.


1010
00:55:38.562 --> 00:55:40.553
Oh, God.

1011
00:55:40.731 --> 00:55:42.562
The smell.

1012
00:55:44.151 --> 00:55:45.937
Yogurt man, are you in here?

1013
00:55:47.237 --> 00:55:49.398
Hello?

1014
00:55:49.573 --> 00:55:52.110
Yogurt man?
Ohh!


1015
00:56:04.630 --> 00:56:06.211
Yogurt man, stand down!

1016
00:56:06.381 --> 00:56:09.088
The mall's haunted!

1017
00:56:11.678 --> 00:56:14.294
Wait.

1018
00:56:14.473 --> 00:56:16.134
Taquito?

1019
00:56:25.943 --> 00:56:28.434
- Taquito.
- I'm sorry, guys.


1020
00:56:28.612 --> 00:56:32.696
I just don't want
anything to change.


1021
00:56:32.866 --> 00:56:34.697
Taquito,
change is important.


1022
00:56:34.868 --> 00:56:37.405
But that doesn't mean we're gonna
forget about our old friends.


1023
00:56:39.122 --> 00:56:41.784
- I don't know.
- Hold on a second, Taquito.


1024
00:56:52.511 --> 00:56:54.467
Taquito, we just had
a Dobis meeting,


1025
00:56:54.638 --> 00:56:56.378
and we've decided to let you
run the mall fountain.


1026
00:57:00.227 --> 00:57:02.138
Really?

1027
00:57:02.312 --> 00:57:04.098
Not only do you have to get it working,
but you have to maintain it


1028
00:57:04.272 --> 00:57:06.638
and keep track of
all the loose change.


1029
00:57:06.817 --> 00:57:10.025
So I think Taquito's gonna be
with us for quite some time.


1030
00:57:10.195 --> 00:57:12.186
Thanks, guys.

1031
00:57:12.364 --> 00:57:14.195
I'll do the best I can.

1032
00:57:14.366 --> 00:57:17.324
I hope I don't kick
the bucket before I finish.


1033
00:57:19.079 --> 00:57:22.788
Shut the fuck up,
you fucking cunt motherfuckers!


1034
00:57:22.958 --> 00:57:25.165
I'll kill you,
you goddamn...


1035
00:57:25.335 --> 00:57:28.168
- Tim, how do I look?
- Take a peek.


1036
00:57:28.338 --> 00:57:30.249
Well, well, well.

1037
00:57:30.424 --> 00:57:32.915
- Sharp as a tack.
- I'm feeling pretty good.


1038
00:57:33.093 --> 00:57:34.674
Big date tonight, huh?

1039
00:57:34.845 --> 00:57:36.836
Yeah. I'm taking Katie
to Inbreadables.


1040
00:57:37.014 --> 00:57:38.049
That'll be nice.

1041
00:57:38.223 --> 00:57:40.680
- I'm trying to impress her.
- Oh. Almost forgot.


1042
00:57:40.851 --> 00:57:42.387
I got you a little
something here.


1043
00:57:42.561 --> 00:57:45.553
- It's called a Spanish fly.
- What is it?


1044
00:57:45.731 --> 00:57:46.891
Let's just say
it'll enhance


1045
00:57:47.065 --> 00:57:48.555
your lovemaking
experience tonight.


1046
00:57:48.734 --> 00:57:50.019
I put this right in my ass?

1047
00:57:50.193 --> 00:57:53.731
Mm, no. You put it orally.
Yeah, right in your mouth.


1048
00:57:55.240 --> 00:57:56.730
Did you swallow it?

1049
00:57:57.951 --> 00:58:00.408
Come on, swallow it.

1050
00:58:00.579 --> 00:58:04.242
- Perfect.
- Didn't go in.


1051
00:58:04.416 --> 00:58:06.702
Come on.
Swallow it.


1052
00:58:06.877 --> 00:58:09.710
Mmm.

1053
00:58:09.880 --> 00:58:11.541
Well, you better
hit the road, then.


1054
00:58:11.715 --> 00:58:13.626
Okay.
Wish me luck, bud.


1055
00:58:13.800 --> 00:58:15.882
I guess I'll just stay here
and work on Dobis.


1056
00:58:16.053 --> 00:58:17.839
Keep my eye on the prize.

1057
00:58:18.013 --> 00:58:20.755
Good luck with the pills.
Good luck.


1058
00:58:22.768 --> 00:58:24.599
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.


1059
00:58:24.770 --> 00:58:27.807
This is James Quall
here to talk about bread,


1060
00:58:27.981 --> 00:58:30.893
and one thing
I'd have to say


1061
00:58:31.068 --> 00:58:34.902
is that I'd rather be
saying all these bread lines


1062
00:58:35.072 --> 00:58:36.232
than standing in one.

1063
00:58:38.950 --> 00:58:42.317
Ah, yes. One thing
that might be a hazard


1064
00:58:42.496 --> 00:58:43.906
about talking about bread

1065
00:58:44.081 --> 00:58:48.245
is they might accuse one
of being a loafer.


1066
00:58:49.711 --> 00:58:51.372
Now I've just
come from Hollywood,


1067
00:58:51.546 --> 00:58:55.084
where they have all these
famous personalities


1068
00:58:55.258 --> 00:58:58.250
Iike Bread Pitt
and Robert Breadford.


1069
00:59:01.473 --> 00:59:03.134
And now...

1070
00:59:03.308 --> 00:59:05.765
I'll be "baguette"

1071
00:59:05.936 --> 00:59:07.972
in 20 minutes.

1072
00:59:08.146 --> 00:59:10.182
Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen.


1073
00:59:15.654 --> 00:59:17.315
I love this place.

1074
00:59:17.489 --> 00:59:18.979
I know what you mean.

1075
00:59:19.157 --> 00:59:21.773
- You want some of this bread slop?
- I'd love some.


1076
00:59:28.291 --> 00:59:30.452
Mmm.

1077
00:59:30.627 --> 00:59:32.959
This is so good.

1078
00:59:42.472 --> 00:59:44.633
This is a funky place.

1079
00:59:46.476 --> 00:59:47.932
So you were telling me
about your mom.


1080
00:59:48.103 --> 00:59:51.436
Oh. Well, my mother calls
every Saturday night, right?


1081
00:59:51.606 --> 00:59:54.769
It's like she's just calling
to see if I have a date.


1082
00:59:54.943 --> 00:59:57.309
- So she doesn't just call--
- Ohh!


1083
00:59:57.487 --> 00:59:58.818
Are you okay, honey?

1084
01:00:13.461 --> 01:00:14.792
Is it getting hot in here?

1085
01:00:14.963 --> 01:00:16.703
I don't think so.

1086
01:00:17.924 --> 01:00:19.505
I'm just feeling
really weird.


1087
01:00:21.344 --> 01:00:22.709
Are you okay, honey?

1088
01:00:26.683 --> 01:00:28.548
There's so much
fucking bread here.


1089
01:00:28.727 --> 01:00:32.060
Fuck. Fuck.
Ohh!


1090
01:00:32.230 --> 01:00:33.640
Isn't it hot
in here, Katie?


1091
01:00:33.815 --> 01:00:36.306
Little something
called Spanish fly.


1092
01:00:36.484 --> 01:00:38.349
Eric, are you okay?

1093
01:00:38.528 --> 01:00:40.519
I have way too many
teeth in my mouth!


1094
01:00:40.697 --> 01:00:42.653
You might need some help.

1095
01:00:44.534 --> 01:00:46.775
- Hi, how are you?
- No!


1096
01:00:48.705 --> 01:00:50.866
What?

1097
01:00:51.041 --> 01:00:53.202
Sorry, Eric, there's nothing
I can do for you now.


1098
01:00:53.376 --> 01:00:55.537
What the fuck is that?

1099
01:00:56.922 --> 01:00:58.378
I'm gonna take you
to the Shrim Healing Center.


1100
01:00:58.548 --> 01:00:59.663
Come on.
You'll feel much better.


1101
01:00:59.841 --> 01:01:01.797
Excuse me.
I'm so sorry, everyone.


1102
01:01:01.968 --> 01:01:04.334
Shrim!

1103
01:01:06.264 --> 01:01:08.050
Come on in, my son.

1104
01:01:08.225 --> 01:01:11.092
Dr. Doone has you now,

1105
01:01:11.269 --> 01:01:14.932
and he's going to make you
feel all better.


1106
01:01:15.106 --> 01:01:16.892
- Where am I?
- Shh.


1107
01:01:17.067 --> 01:01:19.308
Quiet, my boy.

1108
01:01:19.486 --> 01:01:23.775
You need the healing
powers of shrim.


1109
01:01:23.949 --> 01:01:25.189
I can sense that.

1110
01:01:25.367 --> 01:01:26.777
Okay.

1111
01:01:26.952 --> 01:01:28.943
You're in a very bad place.

1112
01:01:33.500 --> 01:01:35.081
Now drop those pants.

1113
01:01:37.837 --> 01:01:41.000
Shrim!

1114
01:01:57.107 --> 01:01:58.563
How was your date?

1115
01:01:59.776 --> 01:02:01.983
Not so good.

1116
01:02:02.153 --> 01:02:03.268
Eric got sick.

1117
01:02:03.446 --> 01:02:06.779
Aw. That's too bad.

1118
01:02:06.950 --> 01:02:09.191
It must be
really unsatisfying.


1119
01:02:10.495 --> 01:02:12.781
Yeah. It was.

1120
01:02:16.001 --> 01:02:17.957
It's a little awkward,
isn't it?


1121
01:02:19.921 --> 01:02:22.583
- Yeah. I suppose.
- I'm so nervous.


1122
01:02:25.051 --> 01:02:27.167
Listen.

1123
01:02:27.345 --> 01:02:29.210
Want to go inside?

1124
01:02:31.224 --> 01:02:32.714
Okay.

1125
01:02:32.892 --> 01:02:34.678
Are you sure?

1126
01:02:34.853 --> 01:02:37.185
No.

1127
01:02:37.355 --> 01:02:40.347
Okay. Let's go.
Come on.


1128
01:02:42.652 --> 01:02:44.813
Step into
the tub, my son.


1129
01:02:44.988 --> 01:02:47.604
That's it.
That's it.


1130
01:02:47.782 --> 01:02:51.149
Everything's going to be
okay, Eric, my boy.


1131
01:02:51.328 --> 01:02:53.489
Dr. Doone has got you,

1132
01:02:53.663 --> 01:02:57.406
and he's going to give you
a nice warm shrim bath.


1133
01:02:57.584 --> 01:02:59.700
- What?
- All my boys have been


1134
01:02:59.878 --> 01:03:02.995
hiding the shrim
inside them for days now,


1135
01:03:03.173 --> 01:03:06.085
and they're excited
to finally let it out all over you.


1136
01:03:06.259 --> 01:03:08.841
- What boys?
- Come, my sons.


1137
01:03:09.012 --> 01:03:11.378
It's time.

1138
01:03:11.556 --> 01:03:14.172
Oh, look at them.
They can barely hold it in.


1139
01:03:15.643 --> 01:03:17.349
Shrim.

1140
01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:19.681
Shrim.

1141
01:03:19.856 --> 01:03:23.144
Shrim. Shrim.

1142
01:03:27.781 --> 01:03:30.193
Yeah.

1143
01:03:42.921 --> 01:03:44.411
Shrim.

1144
01:03:44.589 --> 01:03:46.921
Shrim.

1145
01:03:47.092 --> 01:03:48.878
Shrim.

1146
01:03:49.052 --> 01:03:50.542
Shrim.

1147
01:03:53.390 --> 01:03:54.596
- Ohh!
- Shrim.


1148
01:03:57.894 --> 01:03:59.054
Shrim.

1149
01:03:59.229 --> 01:04:02.892
My boys only eat
the finest, softest meat


1150
01:04:03.066 --> 01:04:06.229
so that they can
achieve a level of shrim


1151
01:04:06.403 --> 01:04:08.018
that's unmatched.

1152
01:04:08.196 --> 01:04:11.063
Shrim. Shrim.

1153
01:04:30.260 --> 01:04:32.467
Oh!

1154
01:04:38.101 --> 01:04:39.511
Let the brown,

1155
01:04:39.686 --> 01:04:41.972
foamy mess
wash all over you.


1156
01:04:56.161 --> 01:04:57.742
Oh, that's a beautiful thing.

1157
01:05:04.961 --> 01:05:07.953
Shrim, shrim.

1158
01:05:17.140 --> 01:05:19.597
This is the power of shrim!

1159
01:05:43.374 --> 01:05:45.911
Jeffrey?

1160
01:05:46.085 --> 01:05:47.621
Is that you, boy?

1161
01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:57.051
What are you doing,
Jeffrey?


1162
01:05:58.389 --> 01:06:00.254
Where's Papa Tim?

1163
01:06:00.433 --> 01:06:01.764
Is he inside?

1164
01:06:02.769 --> 01:06:04.179
Where are you going?

1165
01:06:05.438 --> 01:06:07.144
Hello?

1166
01:06:15.740 --> 01:06:17.651
What the fuck.

1167
01:06:19.953 --> 01:06:22.114
- Shit.
- What's going on?


1168
01:06:22.288 --> 01:06:23.778
Eric, don't do anything
stupid here, buddy.


1169
01:06:23.957 --> 01:06:26.039
I should go.

1170
01:06:26.209 --> 01:06:28.291
Katie. How could
you do this to me?


1171
01:06:28.461 --> 01:06:30.497
- Eric, I'm so sorry.
- Hey, stop.


1172
01:06:30.672 --> 01:06:32.879
You listen to me.
I saved you from her.


1173
01:06:33.049 --> 01:06:35.665
She was nothing but dead weight, Eric.
She was making you soft.


1174
01:06:35.843 --> 01:06:38.550
- She was not making me soft.
- She was making you soft.


1175
01:06:38.721 --> 01:06:40.427
She wasn't making me soft.

1176
01:06:40.598 --> 01:06:42.759
She was making you soft!

1177
01:06:42.934 --> 01:06:45.050
She was making me hard.

1178
01:06:46.145 --> 01:06:47.430
Rock hard.

1179
01:06:48.773 --> 01:06:50.138
Sometimes,
when you're writing,


1180
01:06:50.316 --> 01:06:52.557
you just look for opportunities
to create moments


1181
01:06:52.735 --> 01:06:53.895
that take you
out of the scene


1182
01:06:54.070 --> 01:06:55.401
and just add--
add a joke.


1183
01:06:55.572 --> 01:06:58.530
The jag was that we were
doing "soft, soft, soft"


1184
01:06:58.700 --> 01:07:00.907
and sort of out of
nowhere we go "hard."


1185
01:07:01.077 --> 01:07:03.033
Boom! Laugh.

1186
01:07:03.204 --> 01:07:04.660
We fought
for a laugh track,


1187
01:07:04.831 --> 01:07:07.618
and they said, "No,
this is a feature film for the theaters.


1188
01:07:07.792 --> 01:07:10.249
A laugh track wouldn't
make any sense."


1189
01:07:10.420 --> 01:07:12.331
Think about it.

1190
01:07:12.505 --> 01:07:14.621
Eric, she was
making you soft.


1191
01:07:14.799 --> 01:07:17.256
She's taken your eyes off the game,
Eric, okay? We're here for Dobis.


1192
01:07:17.427 --> 01:07:19.042
What did you give me?
That wasn't Spanish fly.


1193
01:07:19.220 --> 01:07:20.926
I played the oldest trick
in the book.


1194
01:07:21.097 --> 01:07:23.463
But I had to play it 'cause
I needed to save my friend.


1195
01:07:23.641 --> 01:07:25.051
You poisoned me.

1196
01:07:25.226 --> 01:07:28.184
- What else could I do?
- You son of a bitch.


1197
01:07:37.447 --> 01:07:39.733
Motherfucker!

1198
01:07:39.907 --> 01:07:41.272
How could you do that?

1199
01:07:42.368 --> 01:07:43.733
No! No!

1200
01:07:46.456 --> 01:07:48.037
Guys!

1201
01:07:51.002 --> 01:07:53.709
- Jim Joe?
- Why are you fighting? Stop fighting.


1202
01:07:53.880 --> 01:07:56.041
Don't you remember
my poem about peace?


1203
01:07:56.215 --> 01:07:57.796
If you don't remember,
I'll recite it for you.


1204
01:07:57.967 --> 01:08:00.754
- Jim Joe!
- P-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-peace.


1205
01:08:00.928 --> 01:08:04.466
P-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-peace.

1206
01:08:11.689 --> 01:08:13.805
Come on.
Yeah, yeah.


1207
01:08:20.031 --> 01:08:22.022
Aah!

1208
01:08:28.873 --> 01:08:30.829
Like that?

1209
01:08:32.543 --> 01:08:33.828
Ohh!

1210
01:08:35.338 --> 01:08:36.578
You want some of this?

1211
01:08:41.511 --> 01:08:43.172
Oh!

1212
01:08:45.932 --> 01:08:47.513
Aah!

1213
01:08:54.357 --> 01:08:56.973
Why are you fighting?

1214
01:09:06.285 --> 01:09:08.947
Motherfucker!

1215
01:09:14.043 --> 01:09:17.035
No! No!
Aah! Ohh!


1216
01:09:17.213 --> 01:09:19.499
Say you're sorry!

1217
01:09:19.674 --> 01:09:25.385
- I'm sorry!
- Say you're sorry!


1218
01:09:25.555 --> 01:09:28.092
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry I poisoned you.


1219
01:09:28.266 --> 01:09:30.222
- Okay. It's okay.
- I'm sorry for everything!


1220
01:09:30.393 --> 01:09:32.258
I'm sorry I poisoned you.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.


1221
01:09:32.437 --> 01:09:34.268
No, no, no, no.
Listen, I'm sorry, man.


1222
01:09:34.439 --> 01:09:37.351
I'm sorry.
You were looking out for me.


1223
01:09:37.525 --> 01:09:40.141
You were looking out for us
and the whole Dobis thing.


1224
01:09:40.319 --> 01:09:41.650
I know that now.

1225
01:09:41.821 --> 01:09:43.311
I'm glad you finally
see it that way


1226
01:09:43.489 --> 01:09:44.945
'cause I'm just
trying to help.


1227
01:09:45.116 --> 01:09:48.483
Yeah. I just have to
ask you one question.


1228
01:09:48.661 --> 01:09:51.118
Why'd you have to sleep with Katie?
You know I love her.


1229
01:09:51.289 --> 01:09:54.281
Well, to be honest with you,
the plan made me horny.


1230
01:09:54.459 --> 01:09:56.666
I had to empty my ball sack
into something.


1231
01:09:58.504 --> 01:10:01.291
That moist hole
must have felt so good.


1232
01:10:02.842 --> 01:10:04.423
Boy, you really do
love her, don't you?


1233
01:10:04.594 --> 01:10:06.130
I really do.

1234
01:10:06.304 --> 01:10:08.636
It's not gonna bother you
when you're making love to her


1235
01:10:08.806 --> 01:10:10.171
that my wick got
inside that hole?


1236
01:10:10.349 --> 01:10:12.180
Not at all, man.

1237
01:10:12.351 --> 01:10:14.012
There's something
special about it,


1238
01:10:14.187 --> 01:10:15.927
you being deep inside
like that.


1239
01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:19.601
Well, then, it will be an honor
to be your best man.


1240
01:10:25.281 --> 01:10:26.737
Come on down
to the grand re-opening


1241
01:10:26.908 --> 01:10:28.239
of the S'wallow Valley Mall.

1242
01:10:28.409 --> 01:10:29.945
I'll be there. My best friend
Tim Heidecker will be there.


1243
01:10:30.119 --> 01:10:31.450
I think you're gonna
like what you see.


1244
01:10:31.621 --> 01:10:32.952
Ooh, you're gonna like
the fake trees.


1245
01:10:33.122 --> 01:10:34.658
Ooh, you're gonna like
all our new stores.


1246
01:10:34.832 --> 01:10:36.697
Ooh, you're gonna like
meeting my new son Jeffrey.


1247
01:10:36.876 --> 01:10:38.616
My best friend Tim and I redid this
whole mall for you.


1248
01:10:38.795 --> 01:10:39.830
You got to come down.

1249
01:10:40.004 --> 01:10:41.039
It isn't gonna kill you.
Come on down.


1250
01:10:41.214 --> 01:10:42.875
- It's for Dobis' sake!
- I'm gonna murder myself


1251
01:10:43.049 --> 01:10:44.630
if you don't come down
to my new fucking mall.


1252
01:10:48.346 --> 01:10:50.803
Come on down to the grand re-opening
of the S'wallow Valley Mall.


1253
01:10:50.973 --> 01:10:52.713
My dad told me this is
the coolest mall ever.


1254
01:10:52.892 --> 01:10:55.053
You think you know more than my dad?
Don't fucking come, then.


1255
01:10:55.228 --> 01:10:56.889
It's the grand re-opening
of the S'wallow Valley Mall.


1256
01:10:57.063 --> 01:11:00.351
It's just off Route 35
right here in historic S'wallow Valley.


1257
01:11:03.820 --> 01:11:05.310
Where did you get that?

1258
01:11:05.488 --> 01:11:07.695
This guy named Bishopman.
He sends this to me.


1259
01:11:07.865 --> 01:11:10.322
He's been filling up
my voice-mail box for weeks


1260
01:11:10.493 --> 01:11:11.903
with crazy rants
about these guys.


1261
01:11:12.078 --> 01:11:13.488
But look at this.

1262
01:11:13.663 --> 01:11:15.654
We got them, Tommy.
We got them.


1263
01:11:15.832 --> 01:11:18.448
Earle, gather the men.

1264
01:11:18.626 --> 01:11:21.743
We found your boys.
We're gonna go get them.


1265
01:11:54.287 --> 01:11:55.367
All right.

1266
01:11:55.538 --> 01:11:57.278
Listen, guys,
on behalf of Dobis,


1267
01:11:57.456 --> 01:11:59.412
I want to say thank you
for all your hard work


1268
01:11:59.584 --> 01:12:01.370
in getting this mall
back in shape.


1269
01:12:01.544 --> 01:12:02.875
And I gotta say
something personally.


1270
01:12:03.045 --> 01:12:04.410
We're all
very proud of you.


1271
01:12:04.589 --> 01:12:05.795
Guys, tomorrow
is our big day,


1272
01:12:05.965 --> 01:12:08.047
and Dobis couldn't be
more jazzed about it.


1273
01:12:08.217 --> 01:12:09.832
But right now I want
to have a little fun,


1274
01:12:10.011 --> 01:12:11.842
with the permission
of my best friend Tim.


1275
01:12:12.013 --> 01:12:14.220
Muyo permissiono granted.

1276
01:12:17.894 --> 01:12:19.850
Taquito,
would you do the honors?


1277
01:12:20.021 --> 01:12:22.728
Here goes nothing.

1278
01:12:24.108 --> 01:12:25.439
On three, everybody.

1279
01:12:25.610 --> 01:12:28.898
One, two, three!

1280
01:12:31.741 --> 01:12:33.402
Taquito.

1281
01:12:33.576 --> 01:12:34.565
It's wonderful.

1282
01:12:34.744 --> 01:12:36.405
It's gorgeous, Taquito.

1283
01:12:36.579 --> 01:12:39.366
I worked really hard on it.

1284
01:12:39.540 --> 01:12:42.407
- We should make a wish.
- I love it.


1285
01:12:42.585 --> 01:12:44.997
Oh, Dobis, I wish
for this grand re-opening


1286
01:12:45.171 --> 01:12:47.253
to be the greatest grand
re-opening of all time.


1287
01:12:47.423 --> 01:12:49.379
I wish that Tim Heidecker
remains my best friend


1288
01:12:49.550 --> 01:12:51.916
- and I get to marry Katie soon.
- Hmm.


1289
01:12:59.352 --> 01:13:00.967
I forgot about that wolf.

1290
01:13:02.939 --> 01:13:04.930
I know what to do.

1291
01:13:05.107 --> 01:13:08.440
I will need some duct tape
and some pizza.


1292
01:13:24.627 --> 01:13:26.242
Eric, I don't feel
good about this.


1293
01:13:26.420 --> 01:13:28.035
Taquito, be careful.

1294
01:13:29.715 --> 01:13:31.171
Mama Wolf!

1295
01:13:31.342 --> 01:13:32.422
Taquito.

1296
01:13:32.593 --> 01:13:35.505
I have some nice pizza
for you.


1297
01:13:35.680 --> 01:13:37.796
Remember when
we had pizza?


1298
01:13:43.688 --> 01:13:46.430
Hi, Mama Wolf.
Remember your baby boy?


1299
01:13:49.694 --> 01:13:52.356
I have to ask you
a little favor.


1300
01:13:53.823 --> 01:13:55.154
It's time to go
back to the--


1301
01:14:07.503 --> 01:14:08.663
Taquito!

1302
01:14:11.507 --> 01:14:12.838
He's gone.

1303
01:14:13.009 --> 01:14:15.466
Must have snapped that
neck on the way down.


1304
01:14:15.636 --> 01:14:18.002
- He saved the mall.
- Tell you what, Taquito.


1305
01:14:18.180 --> 01:14:19.636
We're going to change
the name of the pizza court


1306
01:14:19.807 --> 01:14:21.092
to the Taquito court,
do you hear me?


1307
01:14:21.267 --> 01:14:22.473
Goodbye, boy.

1308
01:14:22.643 --> 01:14:24.634
I miss the shit
out of him already.


1309
01:14:26.981 --> 01:14:29.347
- Taquito!
- Mr. Weebs?


1310
01:14:29.525 --> 01:14:31.811
What are you doing here?

1311
01:14:31.986 --> 01:14:34.819
I could sense my boy
Taquito was in trouble.


1312
01:14:34.989 --> 01:14:36.695
It's too late.
He's already dead.


1313
01:14:36.866 --> 01:14:38.731
He sacrificed his body
for the mall.


1314
01:14:38.909 --> 01:14:40.115
He's gone.

1315
01:14:42.663 --> 01:14:43.948
Taquito.

1316
01:14:44.123 --> 01:14:45.283
He's alive.

1317
01:14:45.458 --> 01:14:48.200
Uh, am I in heaven?

1318
01:14:49.670 --> 01:14:52.207
Taquito, you killed the wolf,
and you saved the mall.


1319
01:14:52.381 --> 01:14:54.212
You did just what you
said you'd do.


1320
01:14:54.383 --> 01:14:56.374
Uh, I did it.

1321
01:14:56.552 --> 01:14:57.962
I killed the wolf.

1322
01:15:00.306 --> 01:15:02.137
You did, my little boy.

1323
01:15:02.308 --> 01:15:04.173
I'm so proud of you.

1324
01:15:04.351 --> 01:15:06.763
I'm not gonna last long.

1325
01:15:06.937 --> 01:15:09.895
I'm in a lot of pain.

1326
01:15:10.066 --> 01:15:11.681
Oh, Taquito.

1327
01:15:11.859 --> 01:15:16.148
Would you like Uncle Damian
to put some lead in you, son?


1328
01:15:16.322 --> 01:15:18.654
It's so cold down here.

1329
01:15:18.824 --> 01:15:20.735
Put me to sleep forever.

1330
01:15:23.079 --> 01:15:25.070
Oh, Taquito.

1331
01:15:26.749 --> 01:15:29.240
I can't watch him die twice.
I can't do it. Sorry.


1332
01:15:31.045 --> 01:15:34.458
Taquito!

1333
01:15:38.135 --> 01:15:40.091
I'm still here.

1334
01:15:41.472 --> 01:15:44.088
Better try again.

1335
01:15:44.266 --> 01:15:45.972
Okay.

1336
01:15:46.143 --> 01:15:48.976
Taquito!

1337
01:15:49.146 --> 01:15:51.683
Now I can't feel my legs.

1338
01:15:51.857 --> 01:15:54.269
It won't be long now.

1339
01:15:54.443 --> 01:15:55.478
I can't take this.
Finish him off.


1340
01:15:55.653 --> 01:15:57.439
Damn it, Weebs,
shoot him in the face.


1341
01:15:57.613 --> 01:15:59.274
No.

1342
01:15:59.448 --> 01:16:01.734
I want my Taquito to have
an open casket funeral.


1343
01:16:05.996 --> 01:16:09.284
Ow. Ohh!

1344
01:16:09.458 --> 01:16:10.618
Come on, Taquito.

1345
01:16:10.793 --> 01:16:12.954
Just die, Taquito.
Come on.


1346
01:16:16.715 --> 01:16:19.923
Any minute now.

1347
01:16:20.094 --> 01:16:22.585
Maybe I won't be sick
in heaven.


1348
01:16:25.307 --> 01:16:27.798
He's dead.
Is he dead?


1349
01:16:31.313 --> 01:16:33.474
- Yeah.
- Good.


1350
01:16:33.649 --> 01:16:35.389
- Bye-bye.
- Bye, Taquito. Thank you.


1351
01:16:37.153 --> 01:16:38.734
That's it, then.

1352
01:16:51.917 --> 01:16:54.158
A little to the left.

1353
01:16:54.336 --> 01:16:57.373
Back a little bit.
That looks pretty good.


1354
01:16:57.548 --> 01:16:59.004
- It's great.
- Yeah.


1355
01:16:59.175 --> 01:17:01.666
You know what, Eric?
There's something I need to tell you.


1356
01:17:01.844 --> 01:17:03.334
I think you may
have been right.


1357
01:17:04.847 --> 01:17:06.337
I did some numbers
crunching of my own,


1358
01:17:06.515 --> 01:17:08.346
and there's no way
we're going to make


1359
01:17:08.517 --> 01:17:10.053
a billion dollars
running this mall.


1360
01:17:10.227 --> 01:17:13.060
I know. But you know what?
That doesn't matter anymore.


1361
01:17:13.230 --> 01:17:15.437
It's not about the money.
It's about you and me.


1362
01:17:15.608 --> 01:17:17.724
It's about your new son.
It's about Katie.


1363
01:17:17.902 --> 01:17:20.769
It's about the mall. I mean, we've
really made a difference here.


1364
01:17:20.946 --> 01:17:23.813
You know what? They probably forgot
about that billion dollars anyway.


1365
01:17:23.991 --> 01:17:27.154
It's just a billion dollars.
Hee!


1366
01:17:27.328 --> 01:17:30.035
I love this fucking mall!
Come on.


1367
01:17:30.206 --> 01:17:32.037
- To Dobis.
- Hey, big news.


1368
01:17:32.208 --> 01:17:35.041
You have just been made
Dobis' employee of the month.


1369
01:17:35.211 --> 01:17:36.997
I want to live in this
fucking mall forever.


1370
01:17:37.171 --> 01:17:38.456
Yeah.

1371
01:17:39.548 --> 01:17:41.084
Forever?

1372
01:17:47.264 --> 01:17:48.674
Do you forgive me
for sleeping with Tim?


1373
01:17:48.849 --> 01:17:50.089
I do.

1374
01:17:51.393 --> 01:17:53.384
There he is.

1375
01:17:53.562 --> 01:17:54.847
Ohh!

1376
01:17:55.022 --> 01:17:56.728
I hope
you never leave.


1377
01:17:58.776 --> 01:18:00.562
I guess we're gonna
be here forever.


1378
01:18:04.114 --> 01:18:06.400
Look, Dad,
our first customers.


1379
01:18:08.452 --> 01:18:10.033
I don't think those
are customers, son.


1380
01:18:11.372 --> 01:18:12.862
Let me take a look.

1381
01:18:15.709 --> 01:18:17.916
Shit. Schlaaang.

1382
01:18:18.087 --> 01:18:19.543
They found us.

1383
01:18:19.713 --> 01:18:21.624
All right, everybody inside.
Come on.


1384
01:18:29.056 --> 01:18:30.421
What's going on?

1385
01:18:52.079 --> 01:18:53.785
Listen up, Tim and Eric!

1386
01:18:53.956 --> 01:18:55.992
We have you surrounded!

1387
01:18:56.166 --> 01:18:58.578
And if you don't come out
in 10 seconds,


1388
01:18:58.752 --> 01:19:02.370
I'm gonna come in there
and blow you to fucking hell!


1389
01:19:02.548 --> 01:19:05.631
Finally.
Good luck, assholes.


1390
01:19:08.679 --> 01:19:10.795
Ha ha ha! Hey, guys,
it's me-- Allen.


1391
01:19:10.973 --> 01:19:14.591
I was the one who sent you the tape
telling you where to find Tim and Eric.


1392
01:19:14.768 --> 01:19:17.100
Shit!

1393
01:19:17.271 --> 01:19:18.681
- Eric, look out!
- Oh, God!


1394
01:19:21.525 --> 01:19:24.187
Okay, okay, listen, maybe--
maybe I overreacted.


1395
01:19:24.361 --> 01:19:26.352
You think there's
some common ground here--


1396
01:19:26.530 --> 01:19:27.940
I like you-you like me
kind of thing?


1397
01:19:28.115 --> 01:19:30.652
Tim, we need
a Dobis-sized idea stat!


1398
01:19:30.826 --> 01:19:32.782
Okay, hold on now.
Hold on. Let me think.


1399
01:19:32.953 --> 01:19:35.535
- Come on! Think!
- Come on, Tim.


1400
01:19:35.706 --> 01:19:38.743
- What's going on?
- Ah, I got it.


1401
01:19:38.917 --> 01:19:40.703
Reggie, hey,
come on in.


1402
01:19:40.878 --> 01:19:41.993
Come here,
come here, come here.


1403
01:19:42.171 --> 01:19:43.911
- How's everything?
- Good.


1404
01:19:44.089 --> 01:19:46.250
Family good?

1405
01:19:46.425 --> 01:19:48.916
- Yes.
- Okay.


1406
01:19:49.094 --> 01:19:51.085
So, listen, we got
a little thing out here.


1407
01:19:51.263 --> 01:19:53.345
It's not really a big deal. But if you'd
go out there and talk to them,


1408
01:19:53.515 --> 01:19:55.722
maybe knock some sense
into them, Reg.


1409
01:19:55.893 --> 01:19:57.758
- Nice.
- You're a reasonable man.


1410
01:19:57.936 --> 01:19:59.927
They're reasonable men.
You could go out there


1411
01:20:00.105 --> 01:20:01.345
and tell them
to put their guns down.


1412
01:20:01.523 --> 01:20:02.854
Would you do
that for us, Reg?


1413
01:20:03.025 --> 01:20:04.356
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
do it, do it.


1414
01:20:04.526 --> 01:20:05.857
Dobis needs you,
Reg. Please.


1415
01:20:06.028 --> 01:20:07.313
You'd be hitting it
out of the park for us


1416
01:20:07.488 --> 01:20:09.444
if you did it, Reg.

1417
01:20:09.615 --> 01:20:11.822
- I can do that.
- Will you do it? Oh, good. Thanks, Reg.


1418
01:20:11.992 --> 01:20:13.448
Why don't you go ahead
and do that now, then?


1419
01:20:17.748 --> 01:20:19.955
Dobis thanks you, Reg.

1420
01:20:26.882 --> 01:20:27.997
Hi.

1421
01:20:28.175 --> 01:20:30.291
My name is Reggie.

1422
01:20:30.469 --> 01:20:32.926
I think we should all
take a moment here


1423
01:20:33.097 --> 01:20:34.507
and reassess the situation

1424
01:20:34.681 --> 01:20:36.592
because there are a lot
of good people in there


1425
01:20:36.767 --> 01:20:39.099
and I would hate
to see any of them hurt.


1426
01:20:39.269 --> 01:20:41.385
Fire!

1427
01:20:41.563 --> 01:20:42.678
No.

1428
01:20:55.452 --> 01:20:57.659
How do you like that,
Tim and Eric?


1429
01:20:57.830 --> 01:20:59.491
Huh? Ha! Ha!

1430
01:20:59.665 --> 01:21:01.246
Aah!

1431
01:21:01.417 --> 01:21:04.159
That didn't work.
Sorry.


1432
01:21:04.336 --> 01:21:06.327
We're doomed.

1433
01:21:06.505 --> 01:21:09.087
What is that smell?

1434
01:21:10.217 --> 01:21:11.923
I pooped my pants.

1435
01:21:12.094 --> 01:21:14.301
Oh, Allen,
that's disgusting.


1436
01:21:14.471 --> 01:21:16.587
Look, I'm sorry that
I tattled on you two.


1437
01:21:16.765 --> 01:21:18.096
I shouldn't have called.

1438
01:21:18.267 --> 01:21:20.098
I just thought they were going to give
you a slap on the wrist.


1439
01:21:20.269 --> 01:21:21.600
Smell's getting in my eyes.

1440
01:21:21.770 --> 01:21:23.476
Wait a second.
I have an idea.


1441
01:21:23.647 --> 01:21:25.103
Allen, you go
back to your store


1442
01:21:25.274 --> 01:21:26.605
and bring as many swords
as you can carry.


1443
01:21:26.775 --> 01:21:28.857
Okay.

1444
01:21:30.487 --> 01:21:32.728
You're all gonna
die in there!


1445
01:21:40.497 --> 01:21:42.237
Here you go, guys.
As many as I could muster.


1446
01:21:42.416 --> 01:21:44.031
Thanks so much, Allen.
These are great.


1447
01:21:44.209 --> 01:21:45.369
Oh, you're welcome.
You're welcome.


1448
01:21:45.544 --> 01:21:47.080
Anything for you.
I am a team player.


1449
01:21:47.254 --> 01:21:49.415
- Oh. This one's nice.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.


1450
01:21:49.590 --> 01:21:50.955
That's one
of my favorite ones.


1451
01:21:51.133 --> 01:21:53.215
I personally sharpened
that one-- aah!


1452
01:21:55.137 --> 01:21:57.344
That's for
betraying us, Allen!


1453
01:21:57.514 --> 01:22:00.381
- Nice.
- Thanks, man.


1454
01:22:00.559 --> 01:22:02.015
You know this is it.

1455
01:22:03.020 --> 01:22:05.227
I know.

1456
01:22:05.397 --> 01:22:08.309
I gotta say it's been
one hell of a ride.


1457
01:22:08.484 --> 01:22:11.351
- To Dobis.
- To Dobis.


1458
01:22:13.238 --> 01:22:16.105
Katie, I have something
to say to you now.


1459
01:22:22.372 --> 01:22:23.737
You know you're the love
of my life, right?


1460
01:22:23.916 --> 01:22:25.998
Yeah.

1461
01:22:26.168 --> 01:22:28.830
Ever since I met you,
I wanted to consummate that love.


1462
01:22:29.004 --> 01:22:32.417
I wanted to go deep inside
you without a condom


1463
01:22:32.591 --> 01:22:35.003
and explode in
your canal. Psssh.


1464
01:22:35.177 --> 01:22:37.793
Grow a little baby
up in there.


1465
01:22:37.971 --> 01:22:40.758
Start a family.

1466
01:22:40.933 --> 01:22:43.345
So I have to ask you this
one important question.


1467
01:22:49.066 --> 01:22:50.647
Will you marry me?

1468
01:22:50.817 --> 01:22:52.603
Hey, Eric, where'd you
get that big diamond?


1469
01:22:52.778 --> 01:22:55.315
I got it on the "Diamond Jim" set.
I got tons of them.


1470
01:22:55.489 --> 01:22:56.854
Oh, yeah, I got a ton
of them diamonds, too.


1471
01:22:57.032 --> 01:22:59.364
I got, like, a billion
dollars' worth of them.


1472
01:23:01.495 --> 01:23:03.611
Will you make me
the happiest man on earth?


1473
01:23:03.789 --> 01:23:06.622
Yes, I do.

1474
01:23:06.792 --> 01:23:09.408
- Katie!
- No.


1475
01:23:09.586 --> 01:23:11.201
Nice shooting, Tommy.

1476
01:23:11.380 --> 01:23:13.371
Really, really good.

1477
01:23:13.549 --> 01:23:15.289
My love.

1478
01:23:15.467 --> 01:23:17.048
No.

1479
01:23:23.725 --> 01:23:26.057
Schlaaang!

1480
01:23:26.228 --> 01:23:27.843
Eric.

1481
01:23:30.357 --> 01:23:31.437
We doing this?

1482
01:23:31.608 --> 01:23:33.564
Hells, yeah.

1483
01:23:33.735 --> 01:23:35.976
Ah, shit, come on.

1484
01:23:43.579 --> 01:23:45.695
Take them out!

1485
01:24:01.263 --> 01:24:03.800
Okay, listen, I need you
to do something for me.


1486
01:24:03.974 --> 01:24:05.930
It's not going to be easy,
but I know you can do it


1487
01:24:06.101 --> 01:24:07.432
'cause you're my little boy.

1488
01:24:10.397 --> 01:24:12.228
You're the best son
I ever had.


1489
01:24:13.942 --> 01:24:15.432
Hey, Schlaaang!

1490
01:24:18.530 --> 01:24:20.111
Shoot the kid!

1491
01:25:20.717 --> 01:25:22.127
We did it.

1492
01:25:22.302 --> 01:25:23.963
We did it, buddy.

1493
01:25:24.137 --> 01:25:26.799
We really did it.

1494
01:26:05.470 --> 01:26:06.801
Well, what did you think?

1495
01:26:06.972 --> 01:26:11.056
As Steven Spielberg,
I approve of this movie.


1496
01:26:11.226 --> 01:26:14.969
And let me say this is the greatest
film of all time.


1497
01:26:15.147 --> 01:26:17.809
- Yeah.
- Let's celebrate.


1498
01:26:21.027 --> 01:26:22.392

We fucking did it!


1511
01:28:01.545 --> 01:28:04.537
Tim and Eric have taken
my part away from me


1512
01:28:04.714 --> 01:28:06.375
Iike Garry Marshall
did to me


1513
01:28:06.550 --> 01:28:08.506
back with "Laverne and Shirley"
and "Happy Days"


1514
01:28:08.677 --> 01:28:10.542
when they chose
Robin Williams over me.


1515
01:28:15.517 --> 01:28:17.633
Hi. We're Tim and Eric.
I'm Tim Heidecker.


1516
01:28:17.811 --> 01:28:20.268
Hi. I'm Eric Wareheimer,

1517
01:28:20.438 --> 01:28:23.305
- Eric Wareheim.
- Hi. My name is Eric Wareheim.


1518
01:28:23.483 --> 01:28:24.814
This is our
billion dollar movie.


1519
01:28:24.985 --> 01:28:26.475
Thanks so much
for watching.


1520
01:28:26.653 --> 01:28:28.314
I'm proud of the film.
I'm so proud of you, buddy.


1521
01:28:28.488 --> 01:28:30.353
He's my best friend,
and I love him so much.

You guys good?

1529
01:32:59.926 --> 01:33:02.759
Great. Thanks.

1530
01:33:02.929 --> 01:33:04.089
