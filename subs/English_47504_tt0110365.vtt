1
00:01:25.344 --> 00:01:28.061
-Hello?
- It's me. It's done.


2
00:01:28.142 --> 00:01:30.896
I need you in Brooklyn.

3
00:01:30.983 --> 00:01:34.690
An lranian jeweler
is giving me problems.


4
00:01:34.781 --> 00:01:36.931
He needs to disappear.

5
00:01:38.341 --> 00:01:40.409
He's here in Little Odessa.

6
00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.576
Brooklyn's no good for me.
You know that.


7
00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.126
You owe us a debt.

8
00:01:46.218 --> 00:01:49.572
It's important.

9
00:01:49.656 --> 00:01:53.332
Don't you want to see
the old neighborhood again?


10
00:01:53.417 --> 00:01:55.371
I'll call you when I get there.

11
00:01:57.215 --> 00:01:59.410
I'm taking you in, Lee.

12
00:01:59.495 --> 00:02:01.006
Not a chance.

13
00:02:02.614 --> 00:02:06.207
Come on out. Or do I have
to come in and get you?


14
00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:20.159
- That's the whole story, Arch.
- All of it?


15
00:02:20.249 --> 00:02:23.444
You didn't kill him.
I did.


16
00:02:23.528 --> 00:02:25.883
Long time ago.

17
00:02:25.968 --> 00:02:28.719
The day I looked away
and hoped he'd change.


18
00:02:28.806 --> 00:02:31.036
I'll have to tell Jen.

19
00:02:31.126 --> 00:02:33.194
I'd like to tell her myself.

20
00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:58.037
- So, is that it?
- That's it.


21
00:03:45.623 --> 00:03:48.058
Hold the doors.

22
00:05:35.274 --> 00:05:38.105
What?

23
00:05:38.192 --> 00:05:40.547
Huh?

24
00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:51.182
Reuben, get the tea.

25
00:05:51.269 --> 00:05:53.497
It's me, Ma.

26
00:07:04.968 --> 00:07:07.844
Hey.

27
00:07:16.125 --> 00:07:18.683
That will kill you.

28
00:07:21.164 --> 00:07:23.278
- Did you get the syrup?
- Hmm?


29
00:07:24.882 --> 00:07:26.918
I forgot, sorry.

30
00:07:27.002 --> 00:07:28.991
How is Mama?

31
00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:31.037
She all right?

32
00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:11.587
You shouldn't smoke.

33
00:09:00.415 --> 00:09:03.325
Holy shit.
What the fuck is he doing here?


34
00:09:11.532 --> 00:09:14.442
Wake up, wake up, wake up.

35
00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:16.761
- Come on. Get out of the car.
- What are you doing?


36
00:09:16.851 --> 00:09:18.805
- Get out of the car!
- What are you doing?!


37
00:09:45.281 --> 00:09:48.115
Son of a bitch.

38
00:10:16.632 --> 00:10:18.588
Hey.

39
00:10:18.672 --> 00:10:21.107
- You're late.
- I know. I was with Mom.


40
00:10:23.991 --> 00:10:26.505
I am going to be gone
for awhile, all right?


41
00:10:26.591 --> 00:10:29.103
- Okay.
- Finish counting the pennies


42
00:10:29.189 --> 00:10:32.023
and put them in a box.

43
00:10:37.068 --> 00:10:39.136
Hey.

44
00:10:39.226 --> 00:10:41.741
What is it?

45
00:10:41.827 --> 00:10:44.020
- Is he gone?
- Yeah.


46
00:10:44.105 --> 00:10:46.175
If I let you in on something...

47
00:10:46.265 --> 00:10:48.823
- promise to keep it a secret?
- Sure.


48
00:10:48.903 --> 00:10:51.099
Don't say "sure,"
this is big.


49
00:10:53.144 --> 00:10:55.212
Okay. What is it?

50
00:10:57.102 --> 00:10:59.898
- I can't tell you.
- Come on. You can't say that.


51
00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:02.541
Yeah?
Well, it's gonna cost you.


52
00:11:02.621 --> 00:11:04.575
How much?

53
00:11:04.659 --> 00:11:07.492
Those.
The cigarettes right there.


54
00:11:07.579 --> 00:11:09.647
- Those? Okay, how about one?
- No.


55
00:11:09.737 --> 00:11:13.253
- Two cartons every week.
- Fine, fine, man. What is it?


56
00:11:15.856 --> 00:11:18.211
You never heard this
from me, understood?


57
00:11:18.296 --> 00:11:20.364
- Yeah.
- You tell anybody, you go to the dump.


58
00:11:20.454 --> 00:11:22.923
- I know. All right, what is it?
- Your brother's here.


59
00:11:23.015 --> 00:11:24.971
In Brooklyn.

60
00:11:26.533 --> 00:11:28.489
Where is he?

61
00:11:28.573 --> 00:11:30.527
I saw him go into the Metropole
in Queens.


62
00:11:30.611 --> 00:11:32.920
That's all I can say, kid.

63
00:12:23.396 --> 00:12:25.546
Shh! Shh!

64
00:12:28.197 --> 00:12:30.151
Go to bed.
Go back to bed.


65
00:12:32.235 --> 00:12:34.747
Close the door.
She will be all right.


66
00:12:34.833 --> 00:12:37.189
Shh.

67
00:13:55.891 --> 00:13:57.847
Josh.

68
00:13:57.931 --> 00:14:01.445
Josh. Hey.

69
00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:04.406
It's me.

70
00:14:08.048 --> 00:14:10.401
Get out of here.

71
00:14:10.486 --> 00:14:13.445
Okay, then we'll meet later.

72
00:14:13.527 --> 00:14:15.755
It's not safe.

73
00:14:15.845 --> 00:14:18.200
Then we'll meet later,
somewhere else.


74
00:14:19.883 --> 00:14:22.398
I can't do that.
I'm sorry.


75
00:14:28.202 --> 00:14:30.634
You look good, though.
You're growing.


76
00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:33.076
Mom's gonna die.
She's got a brain tumor.


77
00:14:36.359 --> 00:14:39.271
- Does Pop still work at the stand?
- Yeah.


78
00:14:39.359 --> 00:14:42.667
Be on the boardwalk,
near Nathan's


79
00:14:42.757 --> 00:14:45.226
- tomorrow at 4:00.
- Okay.


80
00:14:45.318 --> 00:14:48.114
Come here.

81
00:14:51.076 --> 00:14:53.030
How'd you know I was here?

82
00:14:55.195 --> 00:14:57.468
I won't do anything.
Just tell me.


83
00:14:58.593 --> 00:15:00.504
Sasha Ronov told me.

84
00:15:00.593 --> 00:15:02.866
Nobody can know I'm here.

85
00:15:02.951 --> 00:15:05.386
Not your friends, not any
other relatives, nobody.


86
00:15:05.472 --> 00:15:07.540
Don't discuss it with Sasha
or anybody else.


87
00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:09.700
- Okay.
- Okay?


88
00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:13.336
See you tomorrow.

89
00:15:36.743 --> 00:15:39.301
Fucking Mickey Mouse.

90
00:15:56.856 --> 00:15:59.655
- Who'd you tell about me?
- Nobody.


91
00:15:59.737 --> 00:16:01.646
Don't insult me or I'll cut it off!

92
00:16:01.735 --> 00:16:03.726
I told your brother
and the guys.


93
00:16:03.815 --> 00:16:07.010
I told Victor and Yuri,
but they won't say anything.


94
00:16:07.093 --> 00:16:09.050
- Yuri still run the station?
- Yeah.


95
00:16:09.134 --> 00:16:11.088
You going there now?

96
00:16:13.932 --> 00:16:15.921
Get up!
Get the fuck up!


97
00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:18.927
Let's go.

98
00:16:38.444 --> 00:16:40.401
Volkoff's looking for you.

99
00:16:40.485 --> 00:16:42.439
I know that.

100
00:16:43.483 --> 00:16:45.633
This asshole picked
the wrong fucking time


101
00:16:45.723 --> 00:16:47.791
to be hanging around
my house.


102
00:16:47.881 --> 00:16:49.837
Bad fucking luck.

103
00:16:51.802 --> 00:16:53.916
He wants you bad.
He comes around all the time


104
00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.831
asking where you are.

105
00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:57.876
We got a problem.

106
00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:01.235
You all know I'm here
and that's a problem.


107
00:17:01.319 --> 00:17:03.273
We're gonna work together.

108
00:17:05.277 --> 00:17:07.233
Don't worry, I've got
some money for you.


109
00:17:08.955 --> 00:17:10.911
What if we don't want to help?

110
00:17:43.187 --> 00:17:45.619
Reuben?

111
00:17:45.705 --> 00:17:48.344
- Hey!
- Hey, Ma.


112
00:17:59.102 --> 00:18:01.138
I haven't had much to say.

113
00:18:01.222 --> 00:18:04.054
You were always so quiet.

114
00:18:04.141 --> 00:18:06.575
Aw, so introverted.

115
00:18:10.659 --> 00:18:13.171
You don't go out with girls?

116
00:18:13.257 --> 00:18:16.011
Uh, none of them
will go out with me.


117
00:18:16.098 --> 00:18:18.974
Oh, no you mustn't say that.

118
00:18:20.016 --> 00:18:22.530
Why, don't say that.

119
00:18:23.574 --> 00:18:25.531
Oh, you're beautiful.

120
00:18:25.615 --> 00:18:27.571
- You think I'm beautiful.
- Yes.


121
00:18:27.655 --> 00:18:30.850
Stop it!
Reuben, you are beautiful.


122
00:18:44.368 --> 00:18:46.325
What's the matter?

123
00:18:46.409 --> 00:18:48.365
Nothing.

124
00:18:54.565 --> 00:18:57.444
I know.
I love you too.


125
00:19:00.324 --> 00:19:03.043
Ma, does it hurt?

126
00:19:25.518 --> 00:19:27.472
Hey.

127
00:19:29.997 --> 00:19:32.828
It's fucking--
it's fucking cold out here.


128
00:19:38.273 --> 00:19:40.629
So you're gonna tell me
about Ma?


129
00:19:42.672 --> 00:19:44.628
She got sick
like five months ago.


130
00:19:46.072 --> 00:19:49.187
- What happened?
- She got some headaches.


131
00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:51.660
They said she'd be dead
by now.


132
00:19:54.949 --> 00:19:56.905
- Nathan's.
- Oh.


133
00:20:01.588 --> 00:20:03.736
- You bar mitzvahed?
- Yeah.


134
00:20:03.826 --> 00:20:07.023
- You get a lot of money?
- Not too much.


135
00:20:07.106 --> 00:20:09.664
You can make a lot of money
from those things, you know?


136
00:20:09.744 --> 00:20:12.134
All your friends bring you money--
all your relatives.


137
00:20:12.225 --> 00:20:14.942
- You got friends?
- They're all schwartzes.


138
00:20:15.983 --> 00:20:18.213
What about the girls?

139
00:20:18.303 --> 00:20:21.213
They're schwartzes too.
Pop says not to hang with them.


140
00:20:23.782 --> 00:20:26.214
I wanna come home
and see Ma.


141
00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:29.728
They think you're dead.

142
00:20:29.818 --> 00:20:32.572
What'd you do?

143
00:20:32.659 --> 00:20:35.330
- Did some things.
- There's a lot of rumors.


144
00:20:38.177 --> 00:20:40.291
Biggest killer
in the world's a rumor.


145
00:20:40.375 --> 00:20:42.970
Brooklyn
should be called "Rumors."


146
00:20:49.454 --> 00:20:52.012
- How you doing, you okay?
- Mm-hmm.


147
00:20:53.453 --> 00:20:55.409
We'll do something this week.

148
00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:06.246
Okay, let's go.

149
00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:08.284
Let's go home now.

150
00:21:15.287 --> 00:21:17.560
Son of a bitch.

151
00:21:17.645 --> 00:21:19.601
I'll race you.

152
00:21:47.718 --> 00:21:50.389
Don't worry.
She doesn't look so bad.


153
00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:17.342
Grandma, calm down.
Come on, Josh.


154
00:22:17.428 --> 00:22:20.863
It's no big deal.
Come on.


155
00:22:32.624 --> 00:22:34.580
Did you let him in?

156
00:22:39.423 --> 00:22:41.457
Did you let him in?

157
00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:52.049
He gets what I got,
is that it?


158
00:22:53.098 --> 00:22:55.532
- Come on, Josh.
- Don't you fucking hit him!


159
00:22:55.618 --> 00:22:57.176
Get out of my house.

160
00:22:58.536 --> 00:23:00.528
- Get out of my house...
- Josh! Come on!


161
00:23:00.617 --> 00:23:02.924
or I swear to you, you'll get belted.
Get out of my house.


162
00:23:03.015 --> 00:23:05.893
Get out of my house!
Get out of my house!


163
00:23:05.975 --> 00:23:07.929
- You fucking man.
- Fuck you!


164
00:23:08.013 --> 00:23:09.969
- Get out of my house.
- I'll fucking kill you!


165
00:23:10.053 --> 00:23:12.010
You fucking lay a hand on me!

166
00:23:13.492 --> 00:23:15.881
Get out.

167
00:23:16.932 --> 00:23:18.886
Get out, I said!

168
00:23:23.291 --> 00:23:25.439
Murderer.

169
00:23:25.529 --> 00:23:27.485
Out!

170
00:23:31.127 --> 00:23:33.483
You go to your room!

171
00:24:39.388 --> 00:24:41.344
Alla Shustervich.

172
00:24:42.388 --> 00:24:44.377
Alla Shustervich.

173
00:24:47.427 --> 00:24:50.178
It's Joshua Shapira.

174
00:24:54.823 --> 00:24:56.780
What do you want from me?

175
00:24:58.584 --> 00:25:00.732
I wanted to see you.

176
00:25:00.822 --> 00:25:02.778
But I didn't do anything.

177
00:25:02.862 --> 00:25:05.010
I know that.

178
00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:07.774
How you doing?

179
00:25:09.181 --> 00:25:11.135
I'm gonna go home now.

180
00:25:11.219 --> 00:25:13.175
I heard about your pop.

181
00:25:15.137 --> 00:25:17.606
- I'm sorry.
- Heard about you.


182
00:25:17.698 --> 00:25:20.449
Couldn't come here anymore,
if that's what you mean.


183
00:25:20.536 --> 00:25:22.492
Then why are you here?

184
00:25:22.576 --> 00:25:24.328
I'm leaving soon.

185
00:25:24.416 --> 00:25:26.530
I wanted to see everything.

186
00:25:29.335 --> 00:25:31.927
Alexa told me about you.

187
00:25:32.013 --> 00:25:34.004
Said you left because
of Boris Volkoff.


188
00:25:34.093 --> 00:25:36.480
You've been here long enough.
You know if Mr. Boris


189
00:25:36.571 --> 00:25:38.483
don't like somebody,
he can keep them away.


190
00:25:38.572 --> 00:25:41.164
- That's all it is.
- So you didn't do anything?


191
00:25:41.250 --> 00:25:43.718
Well, don't go
telling people I'm here.


192
00:25:45.570 --> 00:25:48.719
I just wanted to tell you
that I understand.


193
00:25:49.769 --> 00:25:52.361
'Cause here I am.
I can't talk to anybody...


194
00:25:52.447 --> 00:25:54.403
or do anything.

195
00:25:55.447 --> 00:25:57.401
You know?

196
00:25:58.885 --> 00:26:00.842
I hope I see you again.

197
00:26:04.844 --> 00:26:07.517
Anyway, you can go
home now.


198
00:26:14.481 --> 00:26:16.790
- Hello?
- Reuben.


199
00:26:16.881 --> 00:26:18.870
- Yeah?
- It's Joshua.


200
00:26:18.959 --> 00:26:20.916
- Hey.
- Be home at 10:00.


201
00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:22.956
- We'll go to a movie, okay?
- Okay.


202
00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:25.950
- You like the movies?
- Yeah, what are we seeing?


203
00:26:26.038 --> 00:26:27.994
Whatever.
Be home at 10:00.


204
00:26:28.078 --> 00:26:30.032
- Bye.
- Okay.


205
00:28:00.691 --> 00:28:03.683
He was making a call in the phone booth
when the mice found him.


206
00:28:05.969 --> 00:28:09.042
Through the head.
No one saw it.


207
00:28:10.648 --> 00:28:12.604
No one saw it happen.

208
00:28:17.407 --> 00:28:20.238
I don't even know
who would want to do this.


209
00:28:22.365 --> 00:28:24.321
Busy.

210
00:28:49.358 --> 00:28:51.392
Reuben.

211
00:28:52.676 --> 00:28:54.985
My name is Alla,
you remember me?


212
00:28:55.076 --> 00:28:58.111
- I was friends with Sasha.
- Yeah.


213
00:28:58.194 --> 00:29:01.153
I have to talk to you. Your brother
came to see me the other day.


214
00:29:01.235 --> 00:29:02.871
Have you seen him?

215
00:29:02.953 --> 00:29:04.864
'Cause I really need
to talk to him.


216
00:29:04.953 --> 00:29:08.785
- You like movies?
- Yeah.


217
00:29:08.871 --> 00:29:11.147
Meet us on the corner
of 3rd and Brighton.


218
00:29:11.232 --> 00:29:14.506
- 10:00.
- Okay.


219
00:29:14.590 --> 00:29:16.546
Okay. See you.

220
00:29:23.307 --> 00:29:26.856
- But I need it!
- I don't have your fucking leg. Jesus.


221
00:29:26.947 --> 00:29:29.618
Come on! Give me my leg!

222
00:29:29.705 --> 00:29:32.823
Shut up! I gotta deal with this fucking
crazy man, here, and you don't help.


223
00:29:32.906 --> 00:29:34.576
Look, I can't be hopping
around like this!


224
00:29:34.664 --> 00:29:38.452
I don't have your fucking leg. Would
you please get the fuck outta here?


225
00:29:39.822 --> 00:29:41.939
You got my leg.

226
00:29:42.023 --> 00:29:44.899
- He's got my leg.
- Fucking nut.


227
00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:56.615
Our man is Ahmad Pahlevi.

228
00:29:57.738 --> 00:29:59.808
Real camel jockey.

229
00:29:59.898 --> 00:30:03.810
We've heard about him.
He'll be tough, the mice love him.


230
00:30:03.897 --> 00:30:07.331
- So?
- So he's untouchable.


231
00:30:08.615 --> 00:30:12.003
The cops are pussy cats.
You guys know that.


232
00:30:13.213 --> 00:30:15.808
This guy is nothing
but some dumb stukach.


233
00:30:15.892 --> 00:30:18.281
Make him go bye-bye.
You'll see what happens.


234
00:30:18.372 --> 00:30:21.203
He's ratted on so many people,
every asshole in the city,


235
00:30:21.290 --> 00:30:23.121
including the mayor,
will think it was the ltalians


236
00:30:23.210 --> 00:30:24.929
or the schwartzes who did it.

237
00:30:26.051 --> 00:30:29.837
Empty the whole round into his head.
It's bye-bye, Ayatollah.


238
00:30:29.929 --> 00:30:32.043
You're gonna need guns.
You got guns?


239
00:30:32.127 --> 00:30:34.881
I can get 'em.
Mr. Boris, believe it or not.


240
00:30:34.968 --> 00:30:37.844
Keep them small specials,
throw aways.


241
00:30:39.126 --> 00:30:42.118
It won't be long before
Volkoff finds out I'm here.


242
00:30:42.206 --> 00:30:44.593
I think one of his guys
recognized me.


243
00:30:44.684 --> 00:30:48.073
- How do you know that?
- Because he sees everything.


244
00:30:48.163 --> 00:30:50.552
So what happened
to the guy that saw you?


245
00:30:50.643 --> 00:30:53.599
You won't be
seeing him no more.


246
00:30:56.642 --> 00:30:58.915
This was in the garage.

247
00:31:17.356 --> 00:31:19.629
Reuben, Reuben!

248
00:31:20.714 --> 00:31:24.468
What are you doing?
You don't have any homework?


249
00:31:24.554 --> 00:31:27.750
- No, I finished it.
- Are you sure?


250
00:31:30.111 --> 00:31:33.023
What? No, but you should
do your homework,


251
00:31:33.111 --> 00:31:36.465
otherwise you will end up
like, uh, the dumb...


252
00:31:36.549 --> 00:31:40.259
- goyam in our neighborhood.
- I just told you, I finished it.


253
00:31:40.350 --> 00:31:42.543
Well, then, go.
Go home and read.


254
00:31:42.628 --> 00:31:44.505
Why do you force him
all the time?


255
00:31:51.625 --> 00:31:55.254
Let's go. Let's go.

256
00:31:55.345 --> 00:31:58.699
I don't-
- I don't want to go.

257
00:32:31.375 --> 00:32:33.568
We gotta go get
this person.


258
00:32:35.853 --> 00:32:37.730
What the fuck
are you talking about?


259
00:32:37.813 --> 00:32:40.086
Alla Shustervich.

260
00:32:40.171 --> 00:32:41.924
She said she saw you.

261
00:32:42.012 --> 00:32:44.570
She wants to see you.

262
00:32:47.170 --> 00:32:48.649
I didn't tell her
where you are.


263
00:32:48.730 --> 00:32:51.083
I said we'd
pick her up.


264
00:32:53.089 --> 00:32:54.759
What?

265
00:32:56.647 --> 00:32:59.921
- Where are we going?
- 3rd and Brighton.


266
00:33:15.881 --> 00:33:18.634
- Get in. Hurry up.
- Where are we going?


267
00:33:18.721 --> 00:33:21.836
- We're gonna see a movie.
- My mom thinks I'm coming back early.


268
00:33:21.919 --> 00:33:23.352
- How old are you?
- 22.


269
00:33:23.439 --> 00:33:25.635
- When was the last time you went out?
- I don't know.


270
00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:27.515
Get in.

271
00:33:29.638 --> 00:33:31.627
- Pick a movie.
- What movie?


272
00:33:31.716 --> 00:33:35.266
Look in the paper.
Just make sure it's in the city.


273
00:33:36.875 --> 00:33:38.593
Can I smoke in here?

274
00:33:43.393 --> 00:33:45.510
It's Freddy.
He's here.


275
00:33:45.594 --> 00:33:47.901
- I heard him.
- Freddy is dead,


276
00:33:47.992 --> 00:33:50.904
buried and consecrated.
We won, remember?


277
00:33:50.992 --> 00:33:53.982
- He's coming back for us.
- Kincaid's right.


278
00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:56.187
Fred Krueger's history.

279
00:33:56.271 --> 00:33:59.864
- Come here.
- Joey!


280
00:33:59.949 --> 00:34:03.781
- Thank God. I thought for a minute--
- What?


281
00:34:03.867 --> 00:34:06.177
- Dragging us in here.
- Yeah, cut it out!


282
00:34:06.268 --> 00:34:08.541
You're putting one serious dent
in my beauty sleep.


283
00:34:08.626 --> 00:34:10.981
The pipes are cold.

284
00:34:11.066 --> 00:34:15.342
The boiler is cold.
See for yourself.


285
00:34:23.023 --> 00:34:25.091
- Good night, Reuben.
- Good night.


286
00:34:25.181 --> 00:34:26.934
Good night.

287
00:34:51.494 --> 00:34:53.849
So why do you
wanna talk to me?


288
00:34:53.934 --> 00:34:56.048
I don't know.

289
00:34:56.132 --> 00:34:58.407
I didn't expect to go
to a movie and everything. I just...


290
00:34:58.492 --> 00:35:00.643
wanted to talk some more,
you know?


291
00:35:01.931 --> 00:35:03.842
It don't make
no difference to me.


292
00:35:03.931 --> 00:35:06.320
Then what are you
doing here?


293
00:35:06.411 --> 00:35:10.164
Did you kill
Boris Volkoff's son?


294
00:35:10.250 --> 00:35:13.320
That's what you're here for now,
right, to shoot someone?


295
00:35:13.408 --> 00:35:17.479
- That's why you left.
- I can go all over.


296
00:35:20.527 --> 00:35:22.561
Except here.

297
00:35:22.645 --> 00:35:26.081
You can't tell anybody
I'm here.


298
00:35:28.723 --> 00:35:32.080
It's no big deal. Just don't go around
shooting your fucking mouth off.


299
00:35:34.242 --> 00:35:36.597
I can't go back
to Brighton right now.


300
00:35:37.762 --> 00:35:39.955
What else can I say,
you know?


301
00:35:46.399 --> 00:35:48.708
How'd you know
about my father?


302
00:35:48.797 --> 00:35:51.231
I wanted to see you.

303
00:35:52.718 --> 00:35:55.753
- Make sure you were okay.
- No, I mean, how'd you know?


304
00:35:57.236 --> 00:35:58.908
I don't wanna talk anymore.

305
00:36:05.113 --> 00:36:06.865
Gonna give me
your number?


306
00:36:06.953 --> 00:36:09.103
Can go out?

307
00:36:11.111 --> 00:36:13.262
We'll go out this week.

308
00:36:14.752 --> 00:36:16.706
You'll make a call.

309
00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:19.983
Huh?

310
00:36:21.388 --> 00:36:23.539
I don't know.

311
00:36:23.629 --> 00:36:25.347
What?

312
00:36:28.947 --> 00:36:30.858
I have my own phone.

313
00:36:30.947 --> 00:36:33.061
Number's listed.

314
00:36:43.862 --> 00:36:45.740
Does that hurt?

315
00:37:05.056 --> 00:37:07.287
You know
I can't afford it.


316
00:37:07.377 --> 00:37:09.570
You just want
your dress.


317
00:37:10.615 --> 00:37:13.491
Boris could help.
You know he'd help me.


318
00:37:13.573 --> 00:37:15.211
He helps everybody.

319
00:37:15.293 --> 00:37:17.569
And I would
never accept it.


320
00:37:17.654 --> 00:37:20.485
- He could lend you the money.
- Mm-hmm.


321
00:37:22.212 --> 00:37:24.280
You take something from him,

322
00:37:24.370 --> 00:37:27.249
and then you keep taking.

323
00:37:27.331 --> 00:37:29.718
You can never get away.

324
00:37:29.809 --> 00:37:32.403
- You can.
- You can't.


325
00:37:32.489 --> 00:37:34.717
It's too easy.
It's weak.


326
00:37:36.767 --> 00:37:39.441
The weak are the killers
that come quietly.


327
00:37:39.528 --> 00:37:41.517
And that's how they kill.
Like the tumor.


328
00:37:41.606 --> 00:37:44.518
It's God punishing me.

329
00:37:46.164 --> 00:37:48.474
I have to believe that,

330
00:37:48.565 --> 00:37:51.521
because if I didn't,
I couldn't believe in anything.


331
00:37:51.603 --> 00:37:54.720
You will always have your son.

332
00:37:54.803 --> 00:37:58.272
My son.
I had two sons once.


333
00:37:59.362 --> 00:38:03.194
I always tried to teach them.
I always tried to do my best.


334
00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:06.475
I really played music--
I played Mozart for him


335
00:38:06.558 --> 00:38:08.753
when we was
five months old.


336
00:38:08.839 --> 00:38:11.749
Then, I bought him a piano.

337
00:38:11.837 --> 00:38:14.146
I practiced with him.

338
00:38:14.237 --> 00:38:17.033
I read bedtime stories...

339
00:38:19.195 --> 00:38:21.756
every evening.

340
00:38:21.836 --> 00:38:25.110
I was stupid, I guess.

341
00:38:25.194 --> 00:38:28.741
You know, to read to a child
of two years old


342
00:38:28.832 --> 00:38:32.030
"Crime and Punishment,"
I think that's stupid.


343
00:38:32.113 --> 00:38:34.227
You just can't force them.

344
00:38:34.311 --> 00:38:36.267
I never force anybody.

345
00:38:36.351 --> 00:38:38.738
But you know,
there's a saying:


346
00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:44.542
When a child is six years old,

347
00:38:45.668 --> 00:38:49.739
he says the father can
do everything.


348
00:38:50.786 --> 00:38:53.347
When he is 1 2 he says

349
00:38:53.427 --> 00:38:55.734
the father can
almost do everything.


350
00:38:55.825 --> 00:38:57.975
When he's 16,

351
00:38:58.065 --> 00:39:00.452
he says the father's an idiot.

352
00:39:00.543 --> 00:39:04.173
When he is 24,
he says,


353
00:39:04.264 --> 00:39:08.733
father wasn't
maybe such an idiot.


354
00:39:08.822 --> 00:39:12.051
And then when he's 40,
he says,


355
00:39:12.140 --> 00:39:14.735
if I only
could ask my father.


356
00:39:16.459 --> 00:39:18.256
But I'm afraid

357
00:39:18.339 --> 00:39:21.886
my sons will never
ask themselves that.


358
00:39:28.776 --> 00:39:31.891
Are you worried
that I'm married?


359
00:39:31.974 --> 00:39:35.888
It isn't the first thing
on my mind, believe me.


360
00:39:36.933 --> 00:39:39.003
I mean,
does it bother you?


361
00:39:40.813 --> 00:39:42.927
Does it bother you?

362
00:39:57.767 --> 00:40:00.122
Don't you think
we should talk?


363
00:40:01.687 --> 00:40:03.676
Speak English?

364
00:40:08.284 --> 00:40:10.081
Is she a good fuck?

365
00:40:12.204 --> 00:40:14.432
I think we should talk,
don't you?


366
00:40:19.561 --> 00:40:21.756
I'm not gonna be
in Brooklyn long.


367
00:40:21.841 --> 00:40:25.036
But I'm gonna see Ma before she dies,
whether you like it or not.


368
00:40:26.119 --> 00:40:27.951
I'm gonna do it
with or without your help,


369
00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:30.757
but I wanna
make a truce.


370
00:40:30.838 --> 00:40:33.398
Truce, all right?

371
00:40:34.436 --> 00:40:36.666
I don't wanna see Ma
with us fighting.


372
00:40:42.435 --> 00:40:45.948
Your lady friend up there,
how long have you been doing her?


373
00:40:46.033 --> 00:40:47.990
Before or after
Ma got sick?


374
00:40:50.672 --> 00:40:52.583
I love your mother.

375
00:40:53.832 --> 00:40:55.946
Yeah, does Reuben know
about her yet?


376
00:42:33.764 --> 00:42:35.436
It's me, Ma.

377
00:43:28.547 --> 00:43:30.299
Yoshi.

378
00:43:45.662 --> 00:43:49.212
Now you promise me
you'll take care of your brother.


379
00:43:57.820 --> 00:43:59.890
Do you remember
when you were little,


380
00:43:59.980 --> 00:44:03.095
you gave Papa
all your models--


381
00:44:03.178 --> 00:44:04.816
your little plane models?

382
00:44:12.215 --> 00:44:14.410
I don't remember.

383
00:44:14.495 --> 00:44:17.007
Oh, you-- you said, "Papa,

384
00:44:17.093 --> 00:44:20.211
I made all these
plane models for you."


385
00:44:33.209 --> 00:44:35.245
But I know you can change.

386
00:44:35.329 --> 00:44:37.682
You don't believe it,
but I know you can.


387
00:44:37.767 --> 00:44:40.157
Mm-hmm, I guess so.

388
00:44:41.568 --> 00:44:45.718
You go to Grandma's party
on Sunday, tomorrow.


389
00:44:46.766 --> 00:44:48.914
I can't go.
You go for me.


390
00:44:49.004 --> 00:44:51.280
- I'll go.
- She-- she won't say it,


391
00:44:51.365 --> 00:44:54.799
but she would love
if you were to go.


392
00:44:56.723 --> 00:44:58.315
I'll go, Ma.

393
00:45:15.797 --> 00:45:17.628
I love you, Ma.

394
00:45:28.754 --> 00:45:30.390
Lay down, Ma.

395
00:45:52.066 --> 00:45:53.978
This is gonna be our hangout.

396
00:46:01.943 --> 00:46:04.617
You know, every time I come here
the teachers rush us through.


397
00:46:06.344 --> 00:46:08.173
Can't even enjoy it.

398
00:46:09.462 --> 00:46:12.372
These guys don't look too happy
in there, though, do they?


399
00:46:16.381 --> 00:46:17.971
You know what?

400
00:46:18.059 --> 00:46:20.698
I haven't been to school
in like months.


401
00:46:23.297 --> 00:46:25.607
- Why not?
- It's boring.


402
00:46:25.698 --> 00:46:27.654
I'd rather be smoking bud
in a museum.


403
00:46:30.576 --> 00:46:32.726
Let's go see the snakes.

404
00:46:38.455 --> 00:46:40.171
I'm fucked up.

405
00:46:57.088 --> 00:46:58.761
Don't do that.

406
00:46:59.887 --> 00:47:01.605
Don't do that.

407
00:47:01.687 --> 00:47:04.918
Just scared it's gonna smash
through the glass or something,


408
00:47:05.007 --> 00:47:07.360
bite your head off.

409
00:47:07.445 --> 00:47:10.040
If it could, it would.

410
00:47:10.126 --> 00:47:11.921
It might.

411
00:47:12.004 --> 00:47:14.154
Well, I ain't standing near it.

412
00:47:19.643 --> 00:47:22.314
Are you gonna take
someone to the dump?


413
00:47:22.401 --> 00:47:24.790
Make them disappear?

414
00:47:24.881 --> 00:47:26.756
That's what Sasha
always says.


415
00:47:26.839 --> 00:47:30.037
He says you guys take
schwartzes and shit to the dump.


416
00:47:31.878 --> 00:47:34.597
Anyone who goes there
never comes back.


417
00:47:34.678 --> 00:47:37.065
% Don don! %

418
00:47:40.557 --> 00:47:43.831
Sasha's a nobody. He should
shut his fuckin' mouth.


419
00:47:52.872 --> 00:47:54.430
What's the matter?

420
00:47:54.512 --> 00:47:57.310
Oh fuck,
I gotta puke.


421
00:47:57.392 --> 00:47:59.779
Do it in the fucking corner.

422
00:48:07.469 --> 00:48:09.822
Wow.

423
00:48:18.186 --> 00:48:22.542
What the frick is going--
how did you get in here?


424
00:48:22.625 --> 00:48:24.579
What is--

425
00:48:24.663 --> 00:48:26.460
What are you guys doing here?

426
00:48:26.543 --> 00:48:28.101
Whoa! Whoa!

427
00:48:30.341 --> 00:48:32.458
You all right?

428
00:48:32.542 --> 00:48:34.294
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.


429
00:48:34.382 --> 00:48:36.257
Get the fuck up.

430
00:48:47.097 --> 00:48:48.928
- Wrong door.
- Yeah.


431
00:48:53.415 --> 00:48:55.611
When are you gonna leave?

432
00:48:56.934 --> 00:48:58.925
Get some sleep.

433
00:48:59.974 --> 00:49:01.248
You want some?

434
00:49:04.493 --> 00:49:06.563
Got the munchies.

435
00:49:08.371 --> 00:49:09.804
So where you gonna go?

436
00:49:09.891 --> 00:49:12.403
We're Jews, we wander.

437
00:49:12.489 --> 00:49:15.084
Didn't they teach you
that shit in Hebrew school?


438
00:49:16.690 --> 00:49:18.679
Maybe back to Russia.

439
00:49:21.528 --> 00:49:23.915
Are you gonna stay
until after Ma dies?


440
00:49:24.006 --> 00:49:27.079
Don't say that.
She could still pull through.


441
00:49:27.167 --> 00:49:28.883
Okay.

442
00:49:31.445 --> 00:49:33.479
So don't say that.

443
00:49:34.523 --> 00:49:36.116
I hear her crying
all the time.


444
00:49:37.684 --> 00:49:39.877
You've been very strong.

445
00:49:39.962 --> 00:49:41.918
You don't always
have to be that way.


446
00:49:42.002 --> 00:49:43.752
You can feel sad
about it.


447
00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:46.439
I'll try and stay
a little longer.


448
00:49:48.601 --> 00:49:50.715
Are you going
to Grandma's party on Sunday?


449
00:49:50.799 --> 00:49:53.074
We'll see.

450
00:49:53.159 --> 00:49:55.113
- Josh?
- Yeah?


451
00:49:56.797 --> 00:49:58.356
I love you.

452
00:50:02.716 --> 00:50:04.547
Good night.

453
00:50:04.636 --> 00:50:07.102
Feel better
and go to school.


454
00:50:09.315 --> 00:50:11.031
What are we gonna do
about his wife?


455
00:50:12.073 --> 00:50:14.268
If you think she'll say shit
after we get through with him,


456
00:50:14.353 --> 00:50:16.069
you're out
of your fucking mind.


457
00:50:16.151 --> 00:50:20.509
She's no problem. If she is,
someone will visit her too.


458
00:50:20.592 --> 00:50:22.387
Does that backroom have alarms?

459
00:50:22.470 --> 00:50:24.222
There's no alarm.

460
00:50:24.310 --> 00:50:26.299
I got a key.

461
00:50:26.388 --> 00:50:29.540
It's probably the least protected place
in the whole fucking city.


462
00:50:29.629 --> 00:50:32.266
We'll bring him to the dump.
We'll do it there.


463
00:50:32.347 --> 00:50:36.226
We'll burn the body.
If there's no body, there's no crime.


464
00:50:36.307 --> 00:50:40.538
We'll drop the gun there.
They can't pin it on anybody.


465
00:50:42.224 --> 00:50:44.260
All right, Sunday's the night.

466
00:50:47.502 --> 00:50:49.458
- Hello?
- It's Joshua.


467
00:50:49.542 --> 00:50:51.898
- Wanna get something to eat?
- lsn't it late.


468
00:50:51.983 --> 00:50:55.178
I'll come by and pick you up.
We'll go to the diner near you.


469
00:50:55.261 --> 00:50:56.933
The one on Utica.

470
00:50:57.021 --> 00:50:59.328
I better go.

471
00:50:59.419 --> 00:51:02.173
How long you worked
at a candy store?


472
00:51:02.260 --> 00:51:03.976
Three years.

473
00:51:04.058 --> 00:51:06.413
- Looks pretty boring.
- It's okay.


474
00:51:06.498 --> 00:51:08.327
I help old ladies
pick out candy.


475
00:51:08.416 --> 00:51:10.885
I had to do something,
so that's what I'm doing.


476
00:51:10.977 --> 00:51:12.888
It could be worse.

477
00:51:13.935 --> 00:51:16.529
Some people have
to do really bad shit.


478
00:51:16.615 --> 00:51:18.526
I remember once my mother
told me and my brother


479
00:51:18.615 --> 00:51:20.524
she had to fuck a guard
to get out of Russia.


480
00:51:24.252 --> 00:51:27.847
- You wanna go?
- I'm taking the subway.


481
00:51:27.932 --> 00:51:30.808
- You'll get killed on the subway.
- I'll go on the subway.


482
00:51:31.970 --> 00:51:33.529
You like that?

483
00:51:36.009 --> 00:51:37.522
I hate it.

484
00:51:41.087 --> 00:51:42.646
You want a ride?

485
00:51:44.928 --> 00:51:46.484
No.

486
00:53:26.737 --> 00:53:29.127
You asleep?

487
00:53:34.496 --> 00:53:36.849
Did everybody
talk about me?


488
00:53:41.295 --> 00:53:43.124
While I was gone, I mean.

489
00:53:43.213 --> 00:53:45.681
Yeah.

490
00:53:47.771 --> 00:53:49.569
What did they say?

491
00:53:51.532 --> 00:53:54.488
I don't know. They just wanted
to know what you were doing.


492
00:53:57.170 --> 00:53:59.079
Did you think of me?

493
00:53:59.168 --> 00:54:01.239
Not really.

494
00:54:02.607 --> 00:54:04.677
Sometimes.

495
00:54:06.967 --> 00:54:09.638
I wondered where you went.

496
00:54:13.924 --> 00:54:15.915
Why are you so tired?

497
00:54:16.004 --> 00:54:19.358
I don't know, maybe it's because
you don't let me sleep.


498
00:54:26.001 --> 00:54:27.992
Are you gonna go out
and see your brother?


499
00:54:28.081 --> 00:54:30.673
He's nice.

500
00:54:30.759 --> 00:54:33.149
- He's smart.
- Hmm.


501
00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:34.796
Smart kid.

502
00:54:36.078 --> 00:54:38.433
- An American.
- Hmm.


503
00:54:38.518 --> 00:54:40.313
- Think I'm dumb?
- Hmm?


504
00:54:41.836 --> 00:54:44.872
- You think I'm dumb?
- No.


505
00:54:46.795 --> 00:54:48.786
I'm not smart, though,

506
00:54:48.875 --> 00:54:51.341
Iike all the professors
in the organizazia.


507
00:54:54.354 --> 00:54:57.150
My family is smart, though,
in Russia.


508
00:54:57.232 --> 00:54:59.462
Aunt lrene, Uncle Alec,

509
00:54:59.552 --> 00:55:01.700
my parents, my grandparents--

510
00:55:02.750 --> 00:55:04.787
everybody's smart.

511
00:55:11.507 --> 00:55:13.145
You up?

512
00:55:47.499 --> 00:55:50.728
I just wanted to tell you guys,
if something goes wrong


513
00:55:50.817 --> 00:55:52.773
you don't panic.

514
00:55:52.857 --> 00:55:54.447
You tell me.

515
00:55:54.535 --> 00:55:57.289
Or if you can,
we just go on as planned.


516
00:55:57.376 --> 00:55:58.853
You forget about it.

517
00:55:58.934 --> 00:56:01.004
Okay?

518
00:56:03.054 --> 00:56:05.008
You know where
you're going?


519
00:56:47.840 --> 00:56:49.797
We are here

520
00:56:49.881 --> 00:56:52.439
to celebrate

521
00:56:52.519 --> 00:56:54.635
the 80th birthday

522
00:56:55.679 --> 00:56:58.111
of my mama.

523
00:57:03.516 --> 00:57:05.711
Tsilya Sokolova.

524
00:57:05.796 --> 00:57:07.388
80 years.

525
00:57:23.590 --> 00:57:25.421
To our mama.

526
00:57:29.508 --> 00:57:31.420
To our mama.

527
00:57:53.703 --> 00:57:57.216
- Dad, can I talk to you?
- Not now.


528
00:57:57.301 --> 00:57:59.576
Sorry.

529
00:58:07.298 --> 00:58:09.289
Thank you, Mr. Volkoff.

530
00:58:09.378 --> 00:58:11.048
You have been
very generous.


531
00:58:11.136 --> 00:58:14.209
I've treated you
with respect.


532
00:58:15.377 --> 00:58:19.163
Which I would not do
for someone else in your situation.


533
00:58:20.215 --> 00:58:22.169
And I'm grateful.

534
00:58:22.253 --> 00:58:26.042
I've asked for only one thing
in return from you.


535
00:58:27.092 --> 00:58:29.560
I've spared your family.

536
00:58:30.612 --> 00:58:35.207
But I've heard rumors about
that mongrel of a son of yours.


537
00:58:36.571 --> 00:58:39.083
Do you have anything
to tell me?


538
00:58:42.289 --> 00:58:44.801
I will hold you responsible

539
00:58:46.008 --> 00:58:47.919
if he's here.

540
00:58:50.686 --> 00:58:52.642
Do you understand me?

541
00:58:52.726 --> 00:58:55.284
You would know.

542
00:58:55.364 --> 00:58:58.673
I know what it is
to lose a son.


543
00:59:01.683 --> 00:59:03.956
All right.

544
00:59:06.562 --> 00:59:08.518
I trust you.

545
01:02:41.340 --> 01:02:43.774
Put him down.

546
01:02:54.217 --> 01:02:56.649
Do you believe in God?

547
01:02:58.015 --> 01:03:00.450
Wait 10 seconds,
see if God saves you.


548
01:03:24.408 --> 01:03:26.842
Get the tongue.

549
01:03:31.807 --> 01:03:34.273
Bring the body.

550
01:03:46.842 --> 01:03:48.719
Oh fuck.

551
01:04:25.752 --> 01:04:28.218
Drop the gun.
Wipe it down.


552
01:07:06.865 --> 01:07:09.538
Can't remember the rest of it.
I guess...


553
01:07:09.625 --> 01:07:12.091
that's enough for now.

554
01:07:17.862 --> 01:07:20.852
- What's that?
- The Mourner's Kaddish.


555
01:07:20.940 --> 01:07:23.375
Come here every week,
It's the place my father died.


556
01:07:25.859 --> 01:07:28.327
Let's go.

557
01:07:32.537 --> 01:07:36.133
- Going away?
- Yeah.


558
01:07:36.218 --> 01:07:38.650
I thought we were going
to do some things.


559
01:07:38.736 --> 01:07:41.409
I guess I'll just be
sorta hanging around after you leave.


560
01:07:42.934 --> 01:07:46.007
Guess this is it.

561
01:07:46.095 --> 01:07:48.527
Got no choice.

562
01:07:50.133 --> 01:07:53.089
Sorry, I can't make it tonight.

563
01:07:54.932 --> 01:07:57.366
Please don't ask.

564
01:08:10.167 --> 01:08:12.601
Shh, shh.

565
01:08:21.684 --> 01:08:25.470
Are you going through
my mail again?


566
01:08:25.562 --> 01:08:28.157
I found some of my letters

567
01:08:28.243 --> 01:08:30.835
in one of your drawers.

568
01:08:30.921 --> 01:08:33.833
I know you haven't been in school
for two months.


569
01:08:33.921 --> 01:08:37.595
Don't run away.
I want to talk to you.


570
01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:40.146
Reuben, I want to talk to you!

571
01:08:42.558 --> 01:08:44.628
Can I talk to you?

572
01:08:44.718 --> 01:08:47.834
I want to talk to you.

573
01:08:47.917 --> 01:08:51.225
Open the door.
Open the door!


574
01:08:52.635 --> 01:08:55.103
All right.
Don't want to open the door.


575
01:09:18.267 --> 01:09:21.021
I'm sorry I hit you.

576
01:09:21.108 --> 01:09:23.540
But you're always running away.

577
01:09:26.706 --> 01:09:29.172
I don't want you
to see Joshua anymore.


578
01:09:29.264 --> 01:09:32.337
Joshua's not your brother anymore.
Understand?


579
01:09:33.903 --> 01:09:38.258
I've spent my life trying to make
things better for you.


580
01:09:38.341 --> 01:09:41.379
I don't make apologies.

581
01:09:41.462 --> 01:09:43.928
If I make mistakes,
I'm sorry.


582
01:09:46.140 --> 01:09:49.926
You think I like working
at the stand?


583
01:09:50.018 --> 01:09:52.817
Do you think I enjoy
selling gifts


584
01:09:52.899 --> 01:09:55.570
and magazines?

585
01:09:55.657 --> 01:09:58.125
It's only because of you.

586
01:09:59.175 --> 01:10:01.770
To make money for you.

587
01:10:03.256 --> 01:10:06.644
Your brother is a different story.

588
01:10:06.734 --> 01:10:09.009
He's a street rat.

589
01:10:09.094 --> 01:10:12.642
You may think you know all about him,
but believe me you don't.


590
01:10:12.733 --> 01:10:15.199
He has no ambition.

591
01:10:15.291 --> 01:10:17.851
No desire, no nothing.

592
01:10:19.771 --> 01:10:22.237
I know you don't respect me,

593
01:10:22.329 --> 01:10:24.764
but Lord knows I tried my best.

594
01:10:26.528 --> 01:10:28.996
Reuben...

595
01:10:32.086 --> 01:10:34.521
Does your girlfriend respect you?

596
01:11:18.473 --> 01:11:20.941
Came to say bye.

597
01:11:23.153 --> 01:11:25.585
Pop did that to you?

598
01:11:47.466 --> 01:11:49.934
- We're going for a ride.
- What's this?


599
01:11:50.024 --> 01:11:52.458
- Shut up. Shut the fuck up!
- Hey, hey.


600
01:11:52.544 --> 01:11:55.012
We're going for a ride.

601
01:11:55.104 --> 01:11:57.936
Don't worry, don't worry.
It's my son.


602
01:12:40.851 --> 01:12:43.283
Stop.

603
01:12:45.529 --> 01:12:47.997
Turn around.

604
01:13:00.484 --> 01:13:02.953
Take off your coat.

605
01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:20.511
Take off your pants.

606
01:13:42.312 --> 01:13:44.781
Kneel down.

607
01:14:04.026 --> 01:14:08.177
Aren't you gonna say anything?

608
01:14:11.065 --> 01:14:14.339
You're a big man. Is that it?
You're a big man?


609
01:14:14.423 --> 01:14:16.892
I don't need a gun
to be a man.


610
01:14:27.421 --> 01:14:30.252
I don't know...

611
01:14:30.339 --> 01:14:32.807
what made you what you are.

612
01:14:34.017 --> 01:14:37.215
All I ask you
is to leave Reuben alone.


613
01:14:39.696 --> 01:14:42.051
Please.

614
01:14:43.216 --> 01:14:46.092
Even you must know
there's nowhere


615
01:14:46.174 --> 01:14:48.609
you can go anymore.

616
01:14:50.693 --> 01:14:52.570
You have destroyed us.

617
01:14:52.653 --> 01:14:54.883
You have destroyed our family.

618
01:14:59.132 --> 01:15:02.600
Joshua? Joshua?

619
01:15:17.805 --> 01:15:20.559
Hey, Mom.

620
01:15:20.646 --> 01:15:23.112
Hey.

621
01:15:23.204 --> 01:15:25.638
Water?

622
01:16:00.673 --> 01:16:03.586
Mom? Mom?

623
01:16:03.672 --> 01:16:06.425
Mom, are you okay?
Mom? Mom?


624
01:16:06.512 --> 01:16:08.707
Mom!

625
01:18:06.517 --> 01:18:08.986
Hey, Josh.
Can I talk to you a sec?


626
01:18:14.876 --> 01:18:18.264
I know you're gonna leave and all,
but there's something I gotta tell you.


627
01:18:21.353 --> 01:18:23.821
It's your mom.

628
01:18:27.591 --> 01:18:30.060
She's dead.

629
01:21:16.503 --> 01:21:19.621
- Hey, Sasha.
- She did it, she left a kid in the car.


630
01:21:19.704 --> 01:21:23.820
- Hey, have you seen Josh?
- She left the fucking baby--


631
01:21:23.902 --> 01:21:27.449
- What the fuck is wrong with you?
- Somebody just stopped me on my bike.


632
01:21:28.500 --> 01:21:31.252
If Josh is still here,
you gotta tell me.


633
01:21:32.739 --> 01:21:34.297
Come on, man.

634
01:21:36.419 --> 01:21:40.206
He's at Alla's house, all right?

- I don't know which house.


636
01:21:44.696 --> 01:21:47.128
You'll never find which house!

637
01:29:03.252 --> 01:29:05.969
Ma?

638
01:29:06.050 --> 01:29:09.201
Josh is home.

639
01:29:17.287 --> 01:29:21.485
Love you, Ma.

01:29:29.444 --> 01:29:31.912
Ma, Josh is home.
