NETFLIX 呈献

3
00:00:56.451 --> 00:00:57.911
您身为军人
How could a soldier steal royal treasures


4
00:00:57.994 --> 00:01:00.205
怎么能因为国家灭亡

5
00:01:00.288 --> 00:01:02.040
就要偷窃王室的财宝呢？
just because the country is ruined?


6
00:01:02.123 --> 00:01:03.583
高丽不会阵亡
Goryeo will not fall.


7
00:01:04.292 --> 00:01:05.960
如果你是真正的忠臣
If you are truly a loyal man,


8
00:01:07.337 --> 00:01:08.546
就不要阻拦我
do not stand in my way.


9
00:01:09.297 --> 00:01:10.131
将军
General.


10
00:01:18.014 --> 00:01:20.558
（1388年李成桂从威华岛回军
IN 1388, YI SEONG-GYE TURNED HIS ARMY AROUND IN WIHWADO


11
00:01:20.642 --> 00:01:23.812
随后崔莹将军出兵 但败给李成桂后被抓
GENERAL CHOE YEONG SENT HIS MEN BUT WERE DEFEATED


12
00:01:23.895 --> 00:01:26.147
高丽的最后一根支柱倒塌了）
THUS THE LAST PILLAR OF GORYEO FELL


13
00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:30.527
（觉察到危机的一些高丽将军 掠夺了王室的财物
GORYEO GENERALS WHO FELT THE THREAT STOLE THE KINGDOM TREASURES


14
00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.946
并逃到了远海）
AND FLED FAR OUT TO SEA


15
00:02:02.851 --> 00:02:03.685
（朝鲜太祖4年）
I mean,


16
00:02:03.768 --> 00:02:04.644
话说

17
00:02:05.353 --> 00:02:07.313
我知道我们是盗贼
I know that we're thieves鈥?


18
00:02:08.106 --> 00:02:10.150
但为什么被当作逆贼被追呢？
鈥ut why are we being pursued as traitors?


19
00:02:10.233 --> 00:02:12.527
因为做了谋反行为
Well鈥?


20
00:02:11.234 --> 00:02:12.819
鈥e did commit treason.

21
00:02:15.321 --> 00:02:16.531
头目 这是什么意思？
What are you talking about?


22
00:02:17.031 --> 00:02:19.784
快要死到临头了 我告诉你真相吧
We'll be in the afterlife soon, so I'll be truthful.


23
00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:24.205
你记得吗？
Do you remember


24
00:02:25.248 --> 00:02:26.374
三陟树
the Samcheok tree?


25
00:02:26.457 --> 00:02:29.085
记得 用它制作了这个勺子啊
Of course. I made this spoon out of it.


26
00:02:29.669 --> 00:02:31.629
我可是第一次见那种树
- This one? - I've never seen a tree like that.


27
00:02:31.713 --> 00:02:34.507
那是新宫殿的栋梁
That was for the pillars of the new palace.


28
00:02:36.718 --> 00:02:37.552
栋梁？
The pillars?


29
00:02:38.511 --> 00:02:39.345
新宫殿的话
The new palace in Gyeongbokgung.


30
00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:41.931
是指李成桂为了搬迁到汉阳
The one Yi Seong-gye's building in Hanyang to make it to the capital?


31
00:02:42.515 --> 00:02:43.641
而建造的景福宫吗？

32
00:02:44.267 --> 00:02:46.686
为了寻找支撑景福宫的栋梁
Yi Seong-gye searched all over the country


33
00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:48.980
李成桂搜索了全国各地
to find wood for the pillars to support Gyeongbokgung


34
00:02:49.063 --> 00:02:51.399
然后在太白山顶找到了那棵树
and found that tree at the top of Taebaeksan.


35
00:02:51.482 --> 00:02:53.693
我们在广渡口偷的是那个东西吗？
The one we stole in Gwangnaru?


36
00:02:53.776 --> 00:02:54.611
味道怎么样？
How'd it taste?


37
00:02:55.528 --> 00:02:57.739
用景福宫栋梁盛着吃的饭
Eating with the pillars of Gyeongbokgung?


38
00:02:58.364 --> 00:02:59.199
是不是很香？
- Good?


39
00:03:00.033 --> 00:03:01.826
景福宫没有建完是因为…
The reason they stopped building Gyeongbokgung鈥?


40
00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.203
都是因为
It's all鈥?


41
00:03:05.496 --> 00:03:07.707
这个勺子
because of this spoon.


42
00:03:08.249 --> 00:03:09.083
为什么？
Why?


43
00:03:10.168 --> 00:03:11.044
为什么那么做？
Why did you do it?


44
00:03:12.295 --> 00:03:13.922
为了吃饭麻麻香吗？
Probably not just to eat with it?


45
00:03:14.005 --> 00:03:18.343
千年王国的栋梁是三陟树还是百姓？
Are the pillars of a thousand-year dynasty supposed to be a tree or the people?


46
00:03:20.094 --> 00:03:22.430
因为他们看不到眼前的 只从远处找
His vision never included what was right in front of his eyes.


47
00:03:23.348 --> 00:03:24.599
所以我心气不顺
Really got on my nerves.


48
00:03:25.516 --> 00:03:26.976
就因为你心气不顺
So because it got on your nerves--


49
00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.104
让成百上千的官军追赶我们？
You made thousands of soldiers chase after us.


50
00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:32.815
可能现在还在追赶我们
They're probably still after us.


51
00:03:32.899 --> 00:03:33.816
你还笑？
- You're laughing?


52
00:03:34.317 --> 00:03:35.693
笑？他妈的
- Dammit! Let me go!


53
00:03:35.777 --> 00:03:37.862
人死后就不会口渴了吧
If I die, will my thirst die as well?


54
00:03:38.821 --> 00:03:40.740
我先走一天 安顿好了等你们
I'll go a day early to save you all seats when I get there.


55
00:03:42.158 --> 00:03:43.368
我要砍了你的头！
- I'll cut off your head!


56
00:03:44.452 --> 00:03:45.995
放开我！
- Oh get off! - Let me go.


57
00:03:46.663 --> 00:03:48.331
放手 你这个混蛋！
Let me go!


58
00:03:49.332 --> 00:03:50.166
放开我！
Let me go!


59
00:03:56.256 --> 00:03:58.466
来了
So they've come, at last.


60
00:03:59.259 --> 00:04:00.760
来接我了
They've come to take me.


61
00:04:03.054 --> 00:04:05.890
是阴间使者还是仙女？
Are you a woman who lives in the land of the gods?


62
00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:10.603
怎么可以如此漂亮？
How can someone be so beautiful?


63
00:04:13.606 --> 00:04:15.858
竟然死后才遇见命中之人
That I should have to die to meet my destiny.


64
00:04:17.694 --> 00:04:18.528
来
Here.


65
00:04:19.404 --> 00:04:21.155
带我走吧
Take me with you.


66
00:04:35.295 --> 00:04:36.462
起来
Get up.


67
00:04:36.546 --> 00:04:37.505
真是的

68
00:04:39.257 --> 00:04:40.550
别叫我
Leave me alone.


69
00:04:41.634 --> 00:04:42.468
我叫你起来
- You're not getting up?


70
00:04:42.552 --> 00:04:44.721
（获救三个月后）
THREE MONTHS AFTER THE RESCUE


71
00:04:44.804 --> 00:04:45.638
一
One.


72
00:04:47.515 --> 00:04:48.349
二
- Two.


73
00:04:51.978 --> 00:04:53.521
我先穿衣服
Let me put on some clothes first.


74
00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:55.064
团长
Captain, how long are we keeping these bandits on our ship?


75
00:04:55.982 --> 00:04:58.234
你打算让这些盗贼留在船上多久？

76
00:04:58.318 --> 00:05:01.904
他们太懒了 随处拉屎 这帮家伙们太脏了
They're extremely lazy.


77
00:04:59.277 --> 00:05:01.904
They poop anywhere they
like, the disgusting, dirty bastards.

78
00:05:01.988 --> 00:05:03.948
我一直搞不明白这条船
I have no idea what kind of ship this is.


79
00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:06.534
这是海盗船吗？
Is it a pirate ship?


80
00:05:07.577 --> 00:05:08.828
这是海盗船还是渔船？
Are you pirates or fishermen?


81
00:05:09.579 --> 00:05:12.290
而且只劫倭寇船
And if they're pirates, why only attack Japanese pirates?


82
00:05:12.373 --> 00:05:15.168
就是啊 打劫商船才有钱买肉吃啊
You must attack merchant ships for the money to feast on meat.


83
00:05:15.251 --> 00:05:17.462
我们是朝鲜海军吗？ 为什么只劫持倭寇？
We're like the Joseon navy, only attacking the Japanese.


84
00:05:17.545 --> 00:05:18.755
就是说啊
- Exactly! - Ugh.


85
00:05:19.672 --> 00:05:22.050
一股鱼腥味 光是看着就厌倦了
Getting sick just from looking at seafood.


86
00:05:22.133 --> 00:05:24.177
- Ugh. Filthy.

87
00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:25.261
-是谁？ -脏死了
Who did that?


88
00:05:26.554 --> 00:05:29.140
谁把珍贵的粮食扔了？
Who threw precious food on the deck?


89
00:05:30.016 --> 00:05:31.476
是谁把珍贵的粮食扔了？
She asked who threw food on the deck.


90
00:05:31.559 --> 00:05:32.393
是你啊
Who? It was you.


91
00:05:32.477 --> 00:05:35.938
一帮忘恩负义的家伙们！
I've had it with these ungrateful bastards!


92
00:05:36.022 --> 00:05:37.982
-走吧 -盗贼们集合
- Get over here, you thieving scums! - Go on!


93
00:05:38.066 --> 00:05:39.567
-盗贼 -是你扔的嘛 快过去
- Thieving scum. - You did it. It was you.


94
00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:40.485
不是你扔的嘛
Go on. Hurry up.


95
00:05:40.985 --> 00:05:42.653
都给我过来！
Come here. Now!


96
00:05:44.906 --> 00:05:46.157
我是海盗
Uh, I'm a pirate.


97
00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.201
-没见过你啊 -刚来第五天
- Never see you before. - This is my fifth day.


98
00:05:48.284 --> 00:05:49.744
-滚 -是
- Dismissed! - Yes, sir.


99
00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:53.706
你又是谁？
Something funny?


100
00:05:56.334 --> 00:05:58.252
义贼们 过来吧
Bandits, come here.


101
00:06:00.963 --> 00:06:01.964
过来
Come here!


102
00:06:04.759 --> 00:06:05.593
过来
- Come here! - Yeah. I didn't think so.


103
00:06:07.595 --> 00:06:08.596
过来！
Come here!


104
00:06:09.597 --> 00:06:10.431
过来！
Come here!


105
00:06:11.015 --> 00:06:11.933
过来！
Come here!


106
00:06:12.016 --> 00:06:13.351
-过来！ -过来！
- Come here! - Come here!


107
00:06:14.227 --> 00:06:15.686
那边有倭寇！
Japanese pirates! Japanese pirates on the horizon!


108
00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:17.647
Japanese pirates on the horizon!

109
00:06:18.231 --> 00:06:20.566
- Japanese pirate ship?

110
00:06:21.692 --> 00:06:24.028
Woohoo! Yeah!

111
00:06:24.612 --> 00:06:27.281
看他们倭寇船还挺有钱的样子！
Hey! They look pretty rich for a Japanese pirate ship!


112
00:06:28.074 --> 00:06:30.076
看来可以吃肉了！
Huh? We'll be eating meat soon enough.


113
00:06:30.159 --> 00:06:32.787
团长 我会烤出世界上最好吃的味道
Captain, I'll cook you the world's most delicious steak.


114
00:06:33.329 --> 00:06:34.997
牛肉用炭火烤
Let's slowly grill the beef over the fire.


115
00:06:35.081 --> 00:06:36.707
猪肉就煮熟了吃！
And we'll feast on boiled pork!


116
00:06:41.129 --> 00:06:41.963
宝物！
Black clouds. Strong winds.


117
00:06:42.046 --> 00:06:43.965
乌云巨浪！

118
00:06:44.465 --> 00:06:47.009
真是一个舞剑的好天气！
It's perfect weather for sword-fighting.


119
00:06:47.677 --> 00:06:48.845
乌云巨浪？
Black clouds and strong winds?


120
00:06:49.679 --> 00:06:52.348
喂 你会用剑吗？
Hey. Do you even know how to use a sword? Huh?


121
00:06:52.432 --> 00:06:54.350
你可能不知道
Ah, you've heard of me.


122
00:06:54.434 --> 00:06:56.853
虽然我在这里是负责晒鱿鱼的
Up until now, I've only dried squid, but trust me,


123
00:06:56.936 --> 00:06:58.354
但在那片陆地上
on the mainland, they call me Goryeo's Greatest Swordsman!


124
00:06:58.438 --> 00:07:00.481
我被称为高丽第一剑客！

125
00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:05.903
展示一下你的实力如何？
I guess we'll see about that.


126
00:07:08.072 --> 00:07:09.198
高丽第一剑客？
Goryeo's Greatest Swordsman?


127
00:07:10.324 --> 00:07:11.951
-真好笑 -都让开！
Out of my way!


128
00:07:13.578 --> 00:07:15.830
是时候展现真正的实力了！
All right! The time has finally come!


129
00:07:15.913 --> 00:07:19.959
今天由我们义贼团率领！
Today, we bandits will stand on the frontline!


130
00:07:21.586 --> 00:07:22.837
你们海盗
You pirates stay here and prepare to feast on the meat!


131
00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:25.465
就留下来准备肉宴吧！

132
00:07:30.428 --> 00:07:31.262
禹武治
Mu-chi!


133
00:07:31.888 --> 00:07:33.389
别得瑟了 快下来
Stop all your bragging and come down!


134
00:07:33.973 --> 00:07:36.684
别担心我 开火等着吧 娘子
Don't worry about me.


135
00:07:35.057 --> 00:07:36.851
And build the fire, my lady.

136
00:07:37.351 --> 00:07:38.227
不是 团长
I mean, Captain.


137
00:07:40.646 --> 00:07:43.274
来 我们走！
Come on!


138
00:07:41.606 --> 00:07:43.274
Let's go!

139
00:07:43.858 --> 00:07:46.152
火力全开！
Full speed ahead!


140
00:07:46.819 --> 00:07:48.821
Come on! Come on!

141
00:07:58.706 --> 00:08:00.249
不是渔船吗？
Perhaps it isn't a fishing boat?


142
00:08:01.292 --> 00:08:03.252
是渔船
I'm sure it is a fishing boat.


143
00:08:04.545 --> 00:08:07.006
高丽第一剑客出马！
The best swordsman in Goryeo is coming!


144
00:08:09.717 --> 00:08:10.801
是海盗！
Hey, you bastards!


145
00:08:11.344 --> 00:08:12.553
那是鱼线吗？
And I suppose these are fishing rods?


146
00:08:14.597 --> 00:08:15.473
拉过来！
Pull!


147
00:08:16.432 --> 00:08:18.267
再使劲儿！
More! A bit more!


148
00:08:18.351 --> 00:08:20.394
大家随我来！
Yes! Follow my lead!


149
00:08:20.561 --> 00:08:21.562
Go!

150
00:08:28.152 --> 00:08:29.153
傻子
- Idiot.


151
00:08:30.821 --> 00:08:32.448
-我们上 -停下！
- Let's go! - Hold on!


152
00:08:32.532 --> 00:08:34.367
我不需要海盗的帮助！
We don't need help from pirates!


153
00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:35.535
团长 我需要帮助！
We do need help, Captain!


154
00:08:36.118 --> 00:08:38.162
帮帮我们吧 团长！
Please, help us!


155
00:08:49.465 --> 00:08:50.383
把剑给我
- Lend me your sword. - Damn it.


156
00:08:50.466 --> 00:08:51.300
该死
- Help!


157
00:08:51.926 --> 00:08:52.802
救命！

158
00:08:56.681 --> 00:08:59.308
没有碍手碍脚的家伙 打起来会更轻松
Whoo.


159
00:08:56.681 --> 00:08:59.517
I'll have an easier time fighting
without those guys getting in the way.

160
00:09:00.017 --> 00:09:01.143
杀了他！
Kill him!


161
00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:19.036
厉害
Amazing.


162
00:09:30.131 --> 00:09:31.299
禹武治！
- Mu-chi!


163
00:09:37.263 --> 00:09:39.432
我倒要瞧瞧你的实力
Let's see what you can do, Mu-chi.


164
00:09:41.309 --> 00:09:42.143
还笑？
You're laughing?


165
00:09:43.477 --> 00:09:44.604
我手里可是拿着刀呢
I'm holding a sword.


166
00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:47.440
咦？
Oh.


167
00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:20.848
高丽第一剑客
Goryeo's Greatest Swordman.


168
00:10:23.684 --> 00:10:25.394
厉害！
- Amazing!


169
00:10:24.977 --> 00:10:26.896
Amazing! Truly amazing!

170
00:10:26.854 --> 00:10:27.938
真的好厉害！
Shut up!


171
00:10:30.775 --> 00:10:31.859
这是朝鲜的海
These waters belong to Joseon.


172
00:10:34.028 --> 00:10:36.072
你们掠夺了我们的海洋
Because you have plundered in our waters,


173
00:10:36.155 --> 00:10:37.531
所以我都要讨回来
I will be taking that plunder back.


174
00:10:37.615 --> 00:10:40.743
这里是我们的
This is ours鈥?


175
00:10:41.827 --> 00:10:44.246
你们的… 我们的…
Yours鈥?Ours鈥?


176
00:10:45.706 --> 00:10:49.210
我们是沿着海流流动的人
We are sea-faring folk who follow the current.


177
00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:52.254
对于大海 没有你我之分
We make no distinction between our waters and your waters.


178
00:10:54.507 --> 00:10:55.341
说完了吗？
Done?


179
00:10:59.095 --> 00:11:00.471
他说这里也是他们的海
They say these are their waters too.


180
00:11:02.223 --> 00:11:03.391
太短了吧？
What?


181
00:11:03.474 --> 00:11:04.642
That's all, Captain.

182
00:11:03.474 --> 00:11:06.894
团长 我十岁之前一直住在倭寇船上
That's a bit short.


183
00:11:04.725 --> 00:11:06.894
I lived on a Japanese
pirate ship until I was ten.

184
00:11:11.399 --> 00:11:12.233
全部
These


185
00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:14.360
都是你们的海吗？
are all your waters?


186
00:11:14.443 --> 00:11:16.946
全都是你们的吗？
All yours?


187
00:11:17.947 --> 00:11:19.323
白痴 我不是这个意思…
You idiot. That's not what I said--


188
00:11:19.407 --> 00:11:20.241
混蛋！
Shut up!


189
00:11:23.411 --> 00:11:26.122
他说大海都是他们的
He's saying the entire sea is theirs!


190
00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:29.125
团长
Captain.


191
00:11:29.667 --> 00:11:32.503
我搜遍了也没有找到肉
I looked everywhere, but there isn't any meat.


192
00:11:33.629 --> 00:11:35.923
连鸡肉都没有吗？
- There isn't even anything like chicken?


193
00:11:36.006 --> 00:11:37.383
不知道 这帮家伙们
Hey. I have no idea.


194
00:11:38.217 --> 00:11:40.219
好像只吃腌鱼
All this crew eats is pickled fish.


195
00:11:42.722 --> 00:11:44.348
我去找找

196
00:11:44.974 --> 00:11:45.808
让开 我去找找
Please spare us!


197
00:11:46.392 --> 00:11:47.351
放过我们吧！

198
00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:51.313
我们只是…
We're just鈥?


199
00:11:52.106 --> 00:11:53.190
闭嘴！
Shut up!


200
00:11:53.274 --> 00:11:56.402
我们只是来寻找宝物的
We just came here in search of treasure.


201
00:11:57.778 --> 00:11:59.238
巨大的宝物…
A huge stash of gold and silver鈥?


202
00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:00.865
去死吧！
I'll kill you!


203
00:12:05.202 --> 00:12:06.120
他说什么？
What did he say?


204
00:12:06.912 --> 00:12:07.747
Oh.

205
00:12:08.539 --> 00:12:09.707
他说
He鈥?he says they're on a search for


206
00:12:10.875 --> 00:12:12.168
来寻找巨大的宝物
an enormous stash of treasure.


207
00:12:13.836 --> 00:12:14.712
Treasure?

208
00:12:17.339 --> 00:12:19.633
宝物在哪里？
Boy, tell me. Where's this treasure?


209
00:12:20.885 --> 00:12:22.845
宝物 哪里？
Where's the treasure?


210
00:12:30.936 --> 00:12:31.771
我？
Me?


211
00:12:38.319 --> 00:12:40.905
这好像是高丽军营使用的地图
This looks like the maps they use in Goryeo military camps.


212
00:12:42.198 --> 00:12:43.282
没错
Yeah. It is.


213
00:12:43.365 --> 00:12:44.283
我也用过
I used ones just like this.


214
00:12:44.784 --> 00:12:45.826
朱芳
"Joo Bang."


215
00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:47.828
将帅朱芳
General Joo Bang,


216
00:12:47.912 --> 00:12:50.956
带领高丽王室禁卫军的那个朱芳吗？
who led the Goryeo Imperial Guard?


217
00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:54.418
据说席卷了高丽王室的宝物 消失在海里
That Joo Bang?


218
00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:54.794
The one who swept up the
treasure of the imperial family and disappeared?

219
00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:59.006
这是大将军朱芳的藏宝图吗？
You mean this is General Joo Bang's treasure map?


220
00:12:59.089 --> 00:13:00.883
是朱芳的宝物
They said it's Joo Bang's treasure.


221
00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:02.635
有肉吃了！
We could eat meat!


222
00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:05.554
安静！
Quiet! Quiet.


223
00:13:05.638 --> 00:13:07.973
臭小子 你个老幺喊什么！
Why you little鈥?How dare you tell us to be quiet!


224
00:13:11.602 --> 00:13:13.270
团长 我们出发吧
Captain, let's do it.


225
00:13:13.354 --> 00:13:14.772
只要得到这个宝物
If we get this treasure, we'll never have to look at another damn squid ever again.


226
00:13:14.855 --> 00:13:16.398
这该死的鱿鱼也不用晒了

227
00:13:16.482 --> 00:13:17.691
不用晒鱿鱼了

228
00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:19.235
拜托

229
00:13:20.611 --> 00:13:22.238
拜托
Oh, please, please.


230
00:13:22.321 --> 00:13:23.572
怎么样？
- Huh?


231
00:13:26.951 --> 00:13:28.077
这可是宝物啊
It's treasure. Treasure!


232
00:13:31.747 --> 00:13:32.790
走吧
- Please? - Huh?


233
00:13:35.167 --> 00:13:36.210
好！
Okay!


234
00:13:38.629 --> 00:13:39.463
扬帆起航
Let's raise our sails.


235
00:13:41.215 --> 00:13:42.675
出发吧！

236
00:13:42.758 --> 00:13:44.802
我们去寻宝吧！

237
00:13:52.059 --> 00:13:54.228
-拉起来！ -拉起来！
Let's go!


238
00:14:16.125 --> 00:14:19.461
龙女上岸之后无法施力了啊
So I see the dragon's daughter is at a loss


239
00:14:18.377 --> 00:14:19.962
when it comes to being on land.

240
00:14:21.046 --> 00:14:22.756
这不就在这儿嘛
Oh, here. Look, it's right here.


241
00:14:23.465 --> 00:14:25.092
真是的 竟然看不出这个
Don't tell me you can't see it.


242
00:14:25.175 --> 00:14:26.719
- Seriously鈥?

243
00:14:26.802 --> 00:14:27.636
给我吧
Come on!


244
00:14:29.889 --> 00:14:32.391
海里靠龙 陆上还得靠虎吧？
The dragon is master of the sea, but the tiger wins on land.


245
00:14:32.892 --> 00:14:33.726
Uh鈥?

246
00:14:38.856 --> 00:14:41.734
听好了！从现在开始听我指挥！
Right!


247
00:14:40.149 --> 00:14:42.234
You'll follow me from now on!

248
00:14:42.443 --> 00:14:43.402
我们走！
Let's go!


249
00:14:44.695 --> 00:14:46.113
放马过来吧！
Greet your guests!


250
00:14:46.196 --> 00:14:50.117
高丽第一剑客禹武治 和他的手下们来了！
Goryeo's Greatest Swordsman, Wu Mu-chi, and his men have arrived!


251
00:14:51.452 --> 00:14:52.494
什么声音？
What was that?


252
00:14:53.454 --> 00:14:54.330
What was that?

253
00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:55.915
What?

254
00:14:58.500 --> 00:14:59.335
什么声音？

255
00:15:00.002 --> 00:15:01.378
他召唤出了什么东西？
What the hell did he yell at?


256
00:15:01.462 --> 00:15:03.047
-那是什么？ -那边
Over there! Over there!


257
00:15:05.132 --> 00:15:06.175
You saw it!

258
00:15:07.551 --> 00:15:08.469
看到了吗？
- A cow!


259
00:15:08.552 --> 00:15:09.470
是牛！
Do you see it?


260
00:15:08.552 --> 00:15:09.470
A cow!

261
00:15:10.054 --> 00:15:12.348
牛肉先送上门了！
Looks like the meat is coming to greet us first!


262
00:15:15.351 --> 00:15:18.145
寻宝之前先填饱肚子吧！
Before finding the treasure, let's fill our bellies!


263
00:15:18.854 --> 00:15:20.940
住手 别胡来！
- Stop! Do not act out of line.


264
00:15:21.023 --> 00:15:23.275
都跟着我！
Head to the tunnel!


265
00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:26.195
Come on!

266
00:15:30.783 --> 00:15:32.743
牛
Cows! Cows! Cows!


267
00:15:36.246 --> 00:15:37.081
回来！
- No! Come back! - Turn around!


268
00:15:38.248 --> 00:15:39.583
快回来！
No! Come back!


269
00:15:40.918 --> 00:15:41.961
怎么了？
Why?


270
00:15:46.632 --> 00:15:47.508
快躲好！
Get out of the way!


271
00:15:52.638 --> 00:15:53.514
回去！
Turn around!


272
00:16:01.689 --> 00:16:02.940
What's happening?

273
00:16:32.511 --> 00:16:34.722
头目！
Boss!


274
00:16:39.810 --> 00:16:40.728
Why?

275
00:16:42.896 --> 00:16:43.856
他生前那么嚣张
He was too full of himself鈥?


276
00:16:47.109 --> 00:16:50.279
这一生真虚无缥缈
He died such a sudden death after living such a lowly life.


277
00:16:50.779 --> 00:16:52.448
只留下了一个勺子
Leaving behind only his spoon.


278
00:16:54.283 --> 00:16:55.451
团长
Captain.


279
00:16:56.285 --> 00:16:57.119
我们出发吧
We should go.


280
00:17:22.895 --> 00:17:24.605
团长 看那边
Captain, look! Look! Look over there!


281
00:17:25.773 --> 00:17:27.024
怎么活下来的？
How did he survive?


282
00:17:30.277 --> 00:17:31.528
我回来了！
Look who's back, huh?


283
00:17:31.612 --> 00:17:32.446
那是什么？

284
00:17:34.114 --> 00:17:35.157
海浪
- Here. Your hand.


285
00:17:39.745 --> 00:17:40.579
姜燮
Kang-seop.


286
00:17:41.622 --> 00:17:42.456
姜燮
Kang-seop.


287
00:17:44.875 --> 00:17:47.211
终于明白地图上为什么有象牙了
Now I understand why there's a tusk drawn on the map.


288
00:17:47.294 --> 00:17:48.587
这才是真正的藏宝图
This is the real treasure map.


289
00:17:49.463 --> 00:17:52.174
-我们回船上开庆宴吧 -好的 团长
Let us return to the ship and feast.


290
00:17:51.256 --> 00:17:52.841
- Yes, Captain.

291
00:17:52.925 --> 00:17:54.384
藏宝图
A treasure map. A treasure map.


292
00:17:59.264 --> 00:18:02.267
牛群蜂拥而至 为什么还进山洞里？
Why would you enter the cave when there's a herd of cows coming?


293
00:18:03.393 --> 00:18:04.770
我也受伤了
I'm injured too.


294
00:18:07.022 --> 00:18:07.856
真是的
Honestly, unbelievable.


295
00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:09.483
我早就觉得那个洞有问题
I had a bad feeling about that cave.


296
00:18:09.566 --> 00:18:11.235
谁在那哭唧唧啊？
Who's making that damn whiny noise?


297
00:18:12.736 --> 00:18:14.029
盗贼们听好了！
You thieves, listen here!


298
00:18:15.906 --> 00:18:17.032
是义贼
I said we're honest bandits.


299
00:18:20.702 --> 00:18:22.371
我看你们被当成高丽逆贼
I took you in because I pitied how you all fled to sea


300
00:18:22.454 --> 00:18:25.124
逃到海里很可怜 所以收留了你们
after being branded as traitors to Goryeo.


301
00:18:26.542 --> 00:18:28.377
但没想到你们会一直赖着不走
But I didn't think you'd stick around with us.


302
00:18:29.503 --> 00:18:32.881
这段时间你们也养肥了
Seeing how fat you've grown since then,


303
00:18:33.382 --> 00:18:34.967
现在是时候跟你们说了
I think the time has come to tell you.


304
00:18:35.676 --> 00:18:37.177
想让我们离开吗？
Are you telling us to leave?


305
00:18:38.679 --> 00:18:39.513
不
Listen!


306
00:18:41.098 --> 00:18:43.475
自此海盗船
From this moment on, on my ship,


307
00:18:44.601 --> 00:18:46.019
只许海盗上船
only pirates can sail with us.


308
00:18:47.062 --> 00:18:48.313
海盗
- Pirate!


309
00:18:49.523 --> 00:18:51.066
如果义贼变成海盗呢？
And if a bandit becomes a pirate?


310
00:18:51.775 --> 00:18:52.901
接受
Then I'll accept him.


311
00:18:52.985 --> 00:18:55.863
姜燮 你是副头目 所以任命你为跟阿贵一样的小团长
Kang-seop, as you're second-in-command, I'll name you as first mate with A-gwi.


312
00:18:55.946 --> 00:18:56.989
团长
Captain!


313
00:19:00.868 --> 00:19:02.202
我们变成海盗了吗？
Are we pirates now too?


314
00:19:02.286 --> 00:19:03.120
合作愉快
This will be good.


315
00:19:08.167 --> 00:19:09.376
Hey!

316
00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:13.797
喂 你凭什么任命副头目为小团长！
Hey. Who said you could name him as your first mate, huh?


317
00:19:13.881 --> 00:19:15.465
禹武治
Wu Mu-chi, I will鈥?


318
00:19:17.301 --> 00:19:18.677
任命你为副团长
make you my quartermaster.


319
00:19:22.931 --> 00:19:24.349
让我当你的属下？
You'll make me your underling?


320
00:19:25.642 --> 00:19:28.228
我可是高丽第一剑客禹武治
Wu Mu-chi, Goryeo's Greatest Swordsman?


321
00:19:28.312 --> 00:19:29.646
就像海里容不下两个龙王
Just as the sea has only one Dragon King,


322
00:19:30.564 --> 00:19:32.524
海盗团也只能有一个团长
a pirate crew can have only one captain.


323
00:19:32.608 --> 00:19:34.359
难道不是你想成为蜂王吗？
You're not just trying to play queen bee?


324
00:19:35.027 --> 00:19:36.278
说话注意点
Watch what you say, Quartermaster.


325
00:19:36.945 --> 00:19:37.779
副团长
Be careful.


326
00:19:37.863 --> 00:19:39.156
谁是副团长！
Don't call me quartermaster!


327
00:19:39.239 --> 00:19:40.866
看看那些跟着你的盗贼们！
Take a second to look at your bandits, Mu-chi!


328
00:19:41.992 --> 00:19:44.870
我们的生活每天都是生死攸关的战场
Every day is like a war, balanced on the line between life and death.


329
00:19:46.413 --> 00:19:48.832
如果两个人下令就率领不了团队
You cannot lead a group if you confuse them with two different orders.


330
00:19:50.334 --> 00:19:51.460
你是在叫我离开吗？
You telling me to go?


331
00:19:52.502 --> 00:19:53.670
看来你想离开了
If that's what you want.


332
00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:01.470
大家听好了！
Listen to me!


333
00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:05.807
我要离开船并留在这里
I'm abandoning the ship and staying here.


334
00:20:07.059 --> 00:20:07.935
看看那边
Look there!


335
00:20:08.727 --> 00:20:09.978
那片海里没有什么路
The path by sea is unclear.


336
00:20:15.567 --> 00:20:17.945
谁要和我一起走正义之路？
Who will walk the righteous path with me?


337
00:20:20.781 --> 00:20:22.491
没关系 坐着吧 反正你们会留下来
It's fine. Stay seated. You're staying here with me anyway.


338
00:20:22.991 --> 00:20:23.825
保重
Don't get sick.


339
00:20:27.162 --> 00:20:27.996
一起走
- I'm coming too. - Beats being a bandit.


340
00:20:31.583 --> 00:20:32.417
走吧！
Let's go!


341
00:20:33.085 --> 00:20:34.670
从现在开始跟随我的人
Those who follow me are known as pirates from here on out.


342
00:20:35.379 --> 00:20:36.463
都是海盗

343
00:20:36.546 --> 00:20:37.756
-海盗 -保重
Take care.


344
00:20:39.341 --> 00:20:41.260
真的没有人跟随我吗？
Is there really no one who will follow me?


345
00:20:41.969 --> 00:20:43.553
-一 二 -快来吧 大哥
One, two. One, two.


346
00:20:47.391 --> 00:20:48.225
瞧
Those鈥?


347
00:20:49.101 --> 00:20:50.894
不讲义气的家伙们
Look at those disloyal morons, huh?


348
00:20:51.853 --> 00:20:54.773
姜燮 你才是真正的义贼
Kang-seop, you stand for what a bandit should stand for.


349
00:20:55.399 --> 00:20:56.650
-所谓义贼… -多谢了 头目
- For what is a bandit? Those united by-- - Thank you for everything, boss.


350
00:20:56.733 --> 00:20:58.652
义无反顾… 什么？

351
00:20:58.735 --> 00:21:02.030
保重身体 小心官军
Take care of yourself and watch out for soldiers.


352
00:21:02.823 --> 00:21:03.657
姜燮 你…
You'd鈥?Hang on, Kang-seop!


353
00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:05.534
等一下 姜燮

354
00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:07.911
姜燮
- Come on, man. - Hurry up!


355
00:21:07.995 --> 00:21:08.954
-推 -快推
- Wait for me! - Come on. It's you and me!


356
00:21:09.037 --> 00:21:11.248
-等等我！ -姜燮 你和我 禹武治

357
00:21:10.664 --> 00:21:12.416
Now, Wu Mu-chi--

358
00:21:12.708 --> 00:21:14.710
-你们等等我啊！ -姜燮
I said wait for me!


359
00:21:14.334 --> 00:21:15.168
Kang-seop.

360
00:21:16.044 --> 00:21:16.920
过来
Stay here!


361
00:21:17.004 --> 00:21:17.838
过来
Come back here!


362
00:21:19.298 --> 00:21:21.091
-过来！ -等一下
- Come back here! - Wait!


363
00:21:21.174 --> 00:21:22.592
一 二！
One, two!


364
00:21:23.176 --> 00:21:24.553
好 走吧！
Go on, then! Go!


365
00:21:25.762 --> 00:21:27.222
太棒了！
Good riddance!


366
00:21:27.306 --> 00:21:29.099
真棒！
Good riddance!


367
00:21:31.727 --> 00:21:32.561
真棒！

368
00:21:56.084 --> 00:21:58.420
听说你在龟州斩了女真族首领的头…
I'd heard that you killed the leader of Jurchen in Kuju.


369
00:21:58.503 --> 00:21:59.504
（李芳远）
YI BANG-WON


370
00:21:59.588 --> 00:22:00.964
…看来并不是虚张声势
- It appears that was true.


371
00:22:03.425 --> 00:22:04.634
王位？
The throne, you say?


372
00:22:05.802 --> 00:22:09.181
你觉得我率领几百名士兵 是想占据王位吗？
So you think I took command of a few hundred soldiers just to take the throne?


373
00:22:10.349 --> 00:22:12.267
但士兵人数很少
You don't have enough men for that


374
00:22:12.893 --> 00:22:14.603
我觉得不够严谨
and, also, they seem unprepared.


375
00:22:17.731 --> 00:22:19.232
你是个真正的逆贼
You are the real traitor.


376
00:22:19.316 --> 00:22:22.027
多谢您的认可
I appreciate it, you remembering that.


377
00:22:23.153 --> 00:22:24.446
你想说什么？
Just come out with it.


378
00:22:27.324 --> 00:22:28.408
财物
Prosperity.


379
00:22:29.451 --> 00:22:32.162
王位要靠权力夺取 而不是靠阶级
One does not claim the throne through rank but rather with power.


380
00:22:32.829 --> 00:22:36.291
权力来自兵力 其基础唯有财物
You can have an army with wealth, and with an army comes power.


381
00:22:36.833 --> 00:22:39.169
我没有那种财物
I don't have wealth, I must admit.


382
00:22:39.252 --> 00:22:41.088
如果某处藏有宝物
If I told you there was a hidden treasure,


383
00:22:42.798 --> 00:22:43.799
您是否想得到？
will you take it?


384
00:22:49.304 --> 00:22:51.348
没错 这才是海盗喝的酒！
Now this is a pirate ale!


385
00:22:54.726 --> 00:22:55.977
喂 给我
Hey. Give it here.


386
00:22:57.813 --> 00:23:00.816
现在宝物在我们手中了 别担心 尽情吃吧！
The treasure is now within our hands!


387
00:23:00.899 --> 00:23:02.567
他有没有吃饭呢？
Well, I wonder if he ate anything.


388
00:23:04.069 --> 00:23:05.362
要不要我去悄悄带他来？
Shall I go and quietly bring him back here?


389
00:23:07.447 --> 00:23:10.325
如果他想来 他早就游到这里了
If he wanted to come, he would have swum here already.


390
00:23:19.626 --> 00:23:20.460
好饱啊
I'm so full.


391
00:23:29.177 --> 00:23:30.220
Captain!

392
00:23:29.177 --> 00:23:30.470
团长
Man鈥?


393
00:23:31.263 --> 00:23:33.098
象牙不见了！
The elephant tusk is gone!


394
00:23:33.682 --> 00:23:34.808
什么不见了？
What? What is gone?


395
00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:37.727
-象牙不见了 -谁干的？
- The elephant tusk is gone! - Who did this?


396
00:23:37.811 --> 00:23:38.937
还能是谁？
Who do you think did it?


397
00:23:40.564 --> 00:23:42.983
这肮脏的小偷
Ugh. That dirty, thieving bastard!


398
00:23:43.650 --> 00:23:44.734
亏我还认他为头目
I can't believe I ever called him boss.


399
00:23:44.818 --> 00:23:46.319
（取回遗失物 高丽第一剑客）

400
00:23:46.403 --> 00:23:47.237
Dammit!

401
00:23:49.156 --> 00:23:50.282
禹武治！
- Wu Mu-chi!


402
00:23:55.537 --> 00:23:56.997
禹武治 被我抓到你就死定了
Wu Mu-chi, I'm going to kill you if I ever catch you!


403
00:23:59.082 --> 00:24:01.418
但他为什么留下标记了呢？
Why do you think he left us his location?


404
00:24:01.501 --> 00:24:02.377
真蠢
That idiot.


405
00:24:02.461 --> 00:24:04.337
说不定这个混蛋设下了陷阱
Hold on. Is this a trap?


406
00:24:05.505 --> 00:24:06.339
陷阱？
A trap?


407
00:24:07.466 --> 00:24:08.758
我认识他很久了
I've known him a long time.


408
00:24:09.551 --> 00:24:10.886
他没这么狡猾
He's not that cunning. Trust me.


409
00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:15.056
是什么东西在吼？
What is this growling?


410
00:24:16.266 --> 00:24:17.642
声势浩大
What else will growl like that?


411
00:24:18.268 --> 00:24:19.644
除了老虎还有什么？
It has to be a tiger.


412
00:24:20.395 --> 00:24:21.396
老虎？
A tiger?


413
00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:29.029
快跑！
- Run away!


414
00:24:38.288 --> 00:24:39.122
浪儿？
Rang?


415
00:24:41.416 --> 00:24:44.961
-这是梦还是现实啊？ -我要杀了你这个小偷
- Is this real, or a dream? - I'm going to kill you, you damn thief!


416
00:24:45.045 --> 00:24:47.422
-希望这不是梦 -我要杀了你
- It would be nice if it weren't a dream. - I'm going to kill you!


417
00:24:47.506 --> 00:24:48.840
你这个混蛋小偷

418
00:24:51.134 --> 00:24:52.052
好痛
That hurt!


419
00:24:52.135 --> 00:24:53.595
- Ow!

420
00:24:53.678 --> 00:24:55.263
-等等 -去死吧
- Get up! - Wait! Wait a moment!


421
00:24:59.726 --> 00:25:00.602
为什么来找我？
Why did you return?


422
00:25:01.645 --> 00:25:02.771
这么快就想我了吗？
Did you miss me already?


423
00:25:06.816 --> 00:25:09.402
因为你是盗贼 所以偷东西也这么理直气壮吗？
Are you proud of your thievery because you're originally a thief?


424
00:25:10.779 --> 00:25:13.323
海浪 我说过我是义贼
Hey, Hae-rang. I told you I'm honest.


425
00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:16.034
等一下
All right, wait. Just wait.


426
00:25:17.494 --> 00:25:18.328
听我说
Listen to me.


427
00:25:19.538 --> 00:25:20.830
象牙是谁找到的？
Who discovered the tusk?


428
00:25:20.914 --> 00:25:22.249
是我找到的 但你总说我偷…
I discovered it, but you--


429
00:25:23.917 --> 00:25:25.460
总说我偷窃
You call it thievery.


430
00:25:25.544 --> 00:25:28.171
我就说两件事
Yeah. I only have a couple things to say to you.


431
00:25:29.172 --> 00:25:32.717
一 偷窃兄弟的财物必须死
Hmm.


432
00:25:29.172 --> 00:25:32.717
One, you should die for the
crime of stealing from your brothers.

433
00:25:32.801 --> 00:25:34.219
都说了是我找到的
I'm the one that found it.


434
00:25:34.302 --> 00:25:37.264
二 把象牙还回来 我就不杀你
Two, simply return the tusk to me and I won't kill you.


435
00:25:39.224 --> 00:25:40.183
这个威胁真有意思
What an impressive threat.


436
00:25:40.809 --> 00:25:42.477
你忘了我的身份吗？高丽第一剑客
Did you forget? Greatest swordsman.


437
00:25:43.353 --> 00:25:44.938
-连咆哮的老虎都可以… -住嘴
- Even a crying tiger-- - Please stop!


438
00:25:47.691 --> 00:25:49.609
再也不要在我面前提“虎”这个字
Never say the "ger" in tiger in front of me again.


439
00:25:54.573 --> 00:25:55.991
虎

440
00:26:01.496 --> 00:26:03.957
虎

441
00:26:06.084 --> 00:26:06.960
等一下
Hey! Hey! Wait!


442
00:26:07.586 --> 00:26:08.878
Stop!

443
00:26:17.012 --> 00:26:18.805
你真的想杀我啊
You're really trying to kill me! Dammit!


444
00:26:36.031 --> 00:26:36.948
给我象牙
Give me the tusk.


445
00:26:39.409 --> 00:26:41.328
-没有 -是吗？
- I don't have it. - Really?


446
00:26:50.086 --> 00:26:51.588
你说实话 我就告诉你
Answer honestly and I'll tell you.


447
00:26:54.799 --> 00:26:57.552
你来找我 真的是因为象牙吗？
Did you find me because of the tusk,


448
00:26:58.595 --> 00:26:59.596
不是因为想我吗？
or because you missed me?


449
00:27:04.768 --> 00:27:07.312
小幕拿走了
- Mak-yi took it.


450
00:27:09.272 --> 00:27:10.523
头目
- Boss.


451
00:27:12.442 --> 00:27:13.818
象牙？
The tusk?


452
00:27:13.902 --> 00:27:15.195
有小偷！
Thief!


453
00:27:20.033 --> 00:27:21.993
你想自己去寻宝私吞吗？
What, were you planning to find the treasure and keep it all to yourself?


454
00:27:23.119 --> 00:27:25.163
-我看起来那么卑鄙吗？ -不然呢？
- Do I look that dishonorable? - Then what?


455
00:27:27.749 --> 00:27:30.085
很快就会来找我下跪的
Soon she'll come to find me and beg me on her knees.


456
00:27:30.168 --> 00:27:32.295
谁？海浪团长吗？
Who? Captain Hae-rang?


457
00:27:35.757 --> 00:27:38.802
所以你打算以象牙为条件 重新回来当头目？
So your plan is to use the tusk as leverage


458
00:27:37.717 --> 00:27:39.427
to get your position back as boss?

459
00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:41.054
我说
Tell me,


460
00:27:41.721 --> 00:27:44.015
反正都要回去 怎么还带上了被子？
why bring a blanket if you're planning on going back anyway?


461
00:27:44.516 --> 00:27:45.558
是我考虑不周
I wasn't thinking straight.


462
00:27:47.602 --> 00:27:48.937
反正已经上了同一条船
Now that we've sailed here together,


463
00:27:49.854 --> 00:27:50.730
听好了 头目
our fates are linked, huh?


464
00:27:53.983 --> 00:27:56.611
-这里四面八方都是官军 -官军？
There are soldiers in every direction here.


465
00:27:56.695 --> 00:27:59.197
所以熟悉山势的头目先上山顶
- Soldiers? - Yeah.


466
00:27:56.820 --> 00:27:59.197
Since you know the mountains now,
you climb to the peak first.

467
00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:00.115
山顶？
To the peak?


468
00:28:00.198 --> 00:28:02.158
如果觉得安全 就把火石
And if the coast is clear, strike your flint.


469
00:28:02.867 --> 00:28:04.369
啪啪打两次
Clack, clack twice.


470
00:28:05.161 --> 00:28:06.996
-两次 -然后我带着行李上去
- Twice. - And I'll follow with the baggage.


471
00:28:07.497 --> 00:28:09.040
- Mm-hmm.

472
00:28:08.998 --> 00:28:10.166
对
Right.


473
00:28:10.250 --> 00:28:11.209
-对 -对
- Right. - Right.


474
00:28:11.292 --> 00:28:12.377
-对 -好
- You're right. - Okay.


475
00:28:13.878 --> 00:28:14.754
Uh-uh.

476
00:28:16.339 --> 00:28:18.383
行李由手下拎着
Leave this to your subordinate.


477
00:28:19.926 --> 00:28:22.220
头目应该想大事 而不是干杂活
Boss, you need to focus on the bigger stuff, not chores.


478
00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:24.514
你
You鈥?


479
00:28:25.932 --> 00:28:27.142
小幕 你…
Mak-yi, a subordinate?


480
00:28:29.227 --> 00:28:31.896
等我回归了 就命你为副团长
Upon my return,


481
00:28:31.062 --> 00:28:32.355
you're my quartermaster.

482
00:28:33.356 --> 00:28:34.482
-头目 -嗯
- Yes, boss. - Yeah.


483
00:28:38.695 --> 00:28:39.529
打几次火石？
How many strikes?


484
00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:42.741
-两次 -两次
- Twice. - Twice.


485
00:28:42.824 --> 00:28:43.658
好 快去吧
Right. Go on, quickly.


486
00:28:44.951 --> 00:28:47.036
-好 去吧 -小幕
- You got this.


487
00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:48.830
快去吧
Go on, quickly!


488
00:28:51.541 --> 00:28:53.752
-好 -去啊
- Go. Go on. - Right.


489
00:28:56.212 --> 00:28:57.046
往左边走
To the left.


490
00:29:02.177 --> 00:29:03.011
真的
Chump.


491
00:29:04.012 --> 00:29:05.096
太单纯了
So na茂ve.


492
00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:08.641
那晚
That night,


493
00:29:09.392 --> 00:29:11.144
我一遍一遍地点燃了火石
I kept striking the flint all night long.


494
00:29:12.479 --> 00:29:13.396
傻子
Idiot.


495
00:29:14.606 --> 00:29:17.400
海盗都是这种人
Starting to feel like all you pirates are like that.


496
00:29:17.942 --> 00:29:19.152
别说笑了
No more self-pity.


497
00:29:20.570 --> 00:29:23.782
一个叫禹武治的家伙在卖象牙的传闻
The rumor is spreading that Wu Mu-chi is selling the tusk.


498
00:29:24.991 --> 00:29:26.993
已经传遍了大海
It has already spread even across the sea.


499
00:29:27.786 --> 00:29:28.995
小幕 这个狗崽子
Mak-yi, son of a--


500
00:29:29.078 --> 00:29:30.330
（碧澜渡）
BYEOKRANDO


501
00:29:30.413 --> 00:29:31.873
-你不能进去 -让开
- You can't go in there! - Out of my way!


502
00:29:32.582 --> 00:29:34.501
对不起 这个人蛮不讲理
I'm so sorry, sir. He just burst his way in.


503
00:29:34.584 --> 00:29:35.752
我这里有件珍宝
I've come because I have a rare item.


504
00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:39.631
我是高丽第一剑客禹武治
I am Wu Mu-chi, Goryeo's Greatest Swordsman.


505
00:29:39.714 --> 00:29:42.300
禹武治 就是和海浪在一起的人？
The one with Hae-rang? That Wu Mu-chi?


506
00:29:44.677 --> 00:29:46.554
您知道我卑微的履历 真是惭愧
I'm embarrassed that you know my humble history.


507
00:29:46.638 --> 00:29:48.014
在我平定广阔的大海之后
After conquering the vast ocean,


508
00:29:49.057 --> 00:29:51.184
把团长海浪当成妹妹一样疼爱
I cared for Hae-rang just like a sworn sister.


509
00:29:54.270 --> 00:29:55.605
快打招呼吧
Let me introduce.


510
00:29:57.690 --> 00:29:58.817
您贵姓？
Who?


511
00:30:00.318 --> 00:30:01.402
海浪
Hae-rang.


512
00:30:02.612 --> 00:30:03.446
谁？
Who is?


513
00:30:05.156 --> 00:30:05.990
我
I am?


514
00:30:09.661 --> 00:30:12.247
节俭点 一万两
Only 10,000 nyang.


515
00:30:12.956 --> 00:30:15.708
大象牙齿一万两是节俭吗？
Only 10,000 nyang for an elephant tooth?


516
00:30:18.545 --> 00:30:19.754
看来您不知道传说
It's what that legend is about.


517
00:30:20.421 --> 00:30:21.548
什么传说？
What legend?


518
00:30:25.343 --> 00:30:27.595
高丽王国被闪电击中的那一天
It was a day when lightning struck the Kingdom of Goryeo.


519
00:30:27.679 --> 00:30:29.222
李成桂从威华岛调动军队
Yi Seong-gye turned back his army from Wihwado.


520
00:30:29.848 --> 00:30:32.016
连崔莹将军也被打败了 您猜怎么着？
General Choe was defeated. There was no other choice.


521
00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:33.393
但是
However,


522
00:30:33.476 --> 00:30:36.771
即便国家处于灭亡状态 也有谋划未来的将帅
they say, even as the country was in ruin,


523
00:30:35.270 --> 00:30:37.522
there was a great general
who made plans for the future.

524
00:30:37.605 --> 00:30:40.859
从内房库收集黄金 从内侍府扫走财宝
He took the gold from the Royal Treasury and Office of Internal Affairs.


525
00:30:40.942 --> 00:30:43.069
坚决不把它交给李成桂
He wouldn't cede the kingdom to Yi Seong-gye.


526
00:30:43.152 --> 00:30:45.613
用其当作军费重建高丽！
And using the treasure his military would rebuild Goryeo.


527
00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:49.784
W-what?

528
00:30:50.869 --> 00:30:52.245
我第一次听说
I'm hearing this for the first time.


529
00:30:52.328 --> 00:30:53.329
当然了
Of course, you are.


530
00:30:55.331 --> 00:30:57.333
因为知道这个秘密的人都死了
Everybody who knows the secret has died.


531
00:30:58.585 --> 00:31:02.213
这就是通往失踪的皇宫宝物的
You have before you the treasure map that leads to that royal treasure.


532
00:31:02.755 --> 00:31:04.883
藏宝图
The one that disappeared.


533
00:31:07.594 --> 00:31:08.887
快给我看看
Now you must show us


534
00:31:09.721 --> 00:31:12.098
您能够嘲笑一万两的胸怀
your boldness that makes a mockery of 10,000 nyang.


535
00:31:16.019 --> 00:31:18.271
这颗大象牙齿是一万两吗？

536
00:31:18.938 --> 00:31:20.607
拥有它吧 绝对是个不错的选择
You should take it. You will not regret it.


537
00:31:20.690 --> 00:31:21.774
让开！
Out of the way!


538
00:31:25.194 --> 00:31:26.029
你这个混蛋！
You son of a--


539
00:31:29.365 --> 00:31:30.366
姜燮你
Kang-seop, damn you!


540
00:31:31.451 --> 00:31:32.285
你在干吗？
What are you doing?


541
00:31:33.244 --> 00:31:35.288
-我问你话呢 -团长 我要疯了
What's going on?


542
00:31:33.953 --> 00:31:35.872
Oh, Captain. Damn it. What do I do?

543
00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:37.290
-这小子 -怎么办？
This bastard.


544
00:31:38.249 --> 00:31:39.250
您怎么来了？
How鈥?How did you鈥?


545
00:31:40.335 --> 00:31:41.628
真是丑陋不堪
You look so extravagant.


546
00:31:42.211 --> 00:31:44.589
我正要
Yes, yes. I was just about to take that鈥?Yes?


547
00:31:45.757 --> 00:31:46.758
解开
So this is, uh鈥?


548
00:31:47.342 --> 00:31:50.720
这就是你当作妹妹一样宠爱的 海浪姑娘吗？
Wait. So this must be the girl you said was your sworn sister.


549
00:31:52.096 --> 00:31:55.308
非常倔强 脾气又暴躁的那个人？
You said you couldn't stand her because she was too stubborn and hot-tempered.


550
00:31:57.560 --> 00:31:58.394
团长
Captain, please鈥?


551
00:31:59.562 --> 00:32:01.022
杀了我吧！
Please just kill me!


552
00:32:01.606 --> 00:32:03.149
我会杀你的
That I will.


553
00:32:04.651 --> 00:32:05.485
你是谁？
And you are?


554
00:32:07.070 --> 00:32:09.656
我是高丽王国最后的公主…
Well, I'm the last princess of the Kingdom of Goryeo--


555
00:32:09.739 --> 00:32:11.240
把他们绑在一起！
Tie them up together!


556
00:32:12.367 --> 00:32:13.785
公主… 放肆！
A princess? How dare you!


557
00:32:14.827 --> 00:32:17.956
-看到了吧？快松绑 -放肆
Hey! Okay. You saw that? Untie me!


558
00:32:18.039 --> 00:32:19.958
天啊 为什么把我绑起来？
- You're tying me up too? How dare you! - Wait.


559
00:32:20.041 --> 00:32:22.835
-倒是给我松绑啊！ -安静点
- Aren't you gonna untie me? - Pipe down!


560
00:32:22.919 --> 00:32:26.255
我们所拥有的一切 都是靠兄弟们的血汗得到的
Everything we have, we earned with the blood of our brothers.


561
00:32:26.339 --> 00:32:29.175
可破了大义离开的禹武治
But Wu Mu-chi broke and discarded that loyalty,


562
00:32:29.258 --> 00:32:30.718
与刚加入团队的小幕勾结
and colluded with Mak-yi, who recently joined us.


563
00:32:30.802 --> 00:32:33.221
不是勾结 我是被绑架了
It wasn't c-collusion, I was kidnapped!


564
00:32:33.304 --> 00:32:35.098
团长在审判
Don't interrupt the captain while she's delivering her judgment!


565
00:32:35.848 --> 00:32:36.849
留下遗嘱吧
Say your last words!


566
00:32:38.309 --> 00:32:40.895
我身为高丽最后的公主…
- My lady, as the last princess of Goryeo-- - I'll judge you separately.


567
00:32:40.979 --> 00:32:41.938
你的判决回头再说

568
00:32:42.814 --> 00:32:44.148
-她是谁？ -真够放肆
- Such impudence. - Who is she anyway?


569
00:32:44.691 --> 00:32:45.858
熊治
Gom-chi.


570
00:32:45.942 --> 00:32:47.151
Gom-chi!

571
00:32:47.735 --> 00:32:49.153
团长 求求您！
Captain, don't! Please!


572
00:32:50.279 --> 00:32:51.280
我还没结婚
Not only have I not married yet, I haven't even held a woman's hand!


573
00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:53.741
从来没有握过女人的手

574
00:32:55.868 --> 00:32:56.703
但是…
So--


575
00:33:02.834 --> 00:33:05.420
熊治哥
- Gom-chi, Gom-chi, Gom-chi!


576
00:33:05.503 --> 00:33:07.839
我出生在倭寇船上
I鈥?I was born on a Japanese pirate ship


577
00:33:07.922 --> 00:33:10.842
只因我是朝鲜人被欺负了十年
and was abused for ten years just because I wasfrom Joseon.


578
00:33:10.925 --> 00:33:12.343
最后我和妈妈逃出来了
My mother and I fled together.


579
00:33:12.427 --> 00:33:15.054
但偏偏被奴隶船抓住了
Too bad you were captured by a slave-trader ship.


580
00:33:16.723 --> 00:33:18.766
在那里又被欺负了十年
I spent another ten years being abused there!


581
00:33:19.726 --> 00:33:22.437
连妈妈也失去了
And even lost my mother.


582
00:33:23.187 --> 00:33:24.022
不要
Gom-chi鈥?


583
00:33:25.732 --> 00:33:27.191
从我开始吧！
I'll go first!


584
00:33:27.984 --> 00:33:30.653
真正的头目不会让下属先走！
A true boss does not let the subordinate go first.


585
00:33:30.737 --> 00:33:32.655
Ooh.

586
00:33:33.322 --> 00:33:36.200
第一次说话像个头目啊
That's the first time you've said anything like a boss!


587
00:33:37.118 --> 00:33:38.870
我送你上路吧
I'll send you first.


588
00:34:00.141 --> 00:34:01.017
抓住他！
Come on!


589
00:34:02.101 --> 00:34:03.227
让开！

590
00:34:05.980 --> 00:34:07.899
Whoo!

591
00:34:18.701 --> 00:34:20.328
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

592
00:34:21.287 --> 00:34:22.246
Come on.

593
00:34:26.417 --> 00:34:27.460
都停下来！
Everyone, stop!


594
00:34:28.336 --> 00:34:30.088
尤其是你 弓箭手 不要动
Especially you! Archer, don't you move!


595
00:34:31.506 --> 00:34:33.216
放下弓箭
Lower your bow! I said lower your bow, dammit!


596
00:34:35.593 --> 00:34:36.761
你们团长答应我了！
Your captain promised me!


597
00:34:37.261 --> 00:34:39.889
只要交出这颗象牙 她就不杀我
She said she would spare me if I gave her the tusk!


598
00:34:40.848 --> 00:34:41.682
不是吗？
Didn't you?


599
00:34:41.766 --> 00:34:44.060
它已经在我们手中了
I did, but that tusk already belongs to us.


600
00:34:44.143 --> 00:34:44.977
是吗？
Oh yeah?


601
00:34:45.770 --> 00:34:47.605
但是怎么办？它现在在我手中
You sure? It's in my hands now.


602
00:34:48.272 --> 00:34:51.109
要不 送给龙王吧
On the other hand, you want it in the Dragon King's hands.


603
00:34:51.776 --> 00:34:53.361
不可以！
No!


604
00:34:57.990 --> 00:34:58.825
Stop!

605
00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:00.535
我松手了啊！
I'll let it go!


606
00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:02.328
我真松手了！
I'll really drop it!


607
00:35:06.958 --> 00:35:07.917
Hmm.

608
00:35:12.505 --> 00:35:14.006
-给我 -海浪
Give it.


609
00:35:13.506 --> 00:35:14.340
Hae-rang,

610
00:35:15.216 --> 00:35:16.676
你真打算杀我吗？
Were you really gonna kill me?


611
00:35:17.426 --> 00:35:18.553
是啊
Hmm.


612
00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:23.850
我知道你不会死 因为你藏了把刀
Well, I knew you weren't going to die because you were hiding a knife.


613
00:35:29.772 --> 00:35:30.815
你看到了？
You saw that?


614
00:35:36.112 --> 00:35:38.114
都是大男人了 还又哭又笑的
I see a man who cries then laughs.


615
00:35:41.826 --> 00:35:42.660
果然
Just as I thought, you're prettiest when you're being mean.


616
00:35:43.202 --> 00:35:44.745
你冷冰冰的时候最美

617
00:35:53.713 --> 00:35:56.257
救救我！
Save me!


618
00:35:55.214 --> 00:35:56.799
Save me!

619
00:36:01.429 --> 00:36:04.390
我们逃跑吧 头目 我再也不想当奴隶了
Let's run away, boss. I can't live as a slave any longer.


620
00:36:05.975 --> 00:36:08.811
你要是没背叛我 你现在就是副团长
You'd be a quartermaster now if you hadn't betrayed me.


621
00:36:10.855 --> 00:36:13.107
-应该好好开火石啊 -你还敢说！
- You should've struck the flint properly. - You!


622
00:36:15.860 --> 00:36:18.112
我都开到手上起泡了
I struck the flint until I got blisters on my hands.


623
00:36:20.740 --> 00:36:22.408
要开到水泡爆开为止啊
You should've struck it until until the blisters burst!


624
00:36:23.451 --> 00:36:25.536
-我要撕了你的嘴 -哥哥
You鈥?you shut your mouth!


625
00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:27.246
-放开我 -他们是在玩
- Mister, they're messing around. - Get off me!


626
00:36:27.330 --> 00:36:28.247
你先放手

627
00:36:31.709 --> 00:36:32.668
好晕哦

628
00:36:36.005 --> 00:36:37.632
高丽军营使用的破译法
Quartermaster, how do you know the Goryeo military way of cracking the code?


629
00:36:38.507 --> 00:36:39.675
你是怎么知道的？

630
00:36:40.968 --> 00:36:43.429
因为我是高丽王国最后的武士
I told you. I was the last warrior of the Kindgom of Goryeo.


631
00:36:44.889 --> 00:36:46.766
阿猫阿狗都是最后的武士
Dogs and cows claim to be the last warrior as well.


632
00:36:47.725 --> 00:36:49.685
光是那些家伙 都能召集百万大军了
If you gather all of them, you'd have a million soldiers.


633
00:36:51.062 --> 00:36:51.896
阿猫阿狗？
Dogs and cows?


634
00:36:54.023 --> 00:36:54.857
干正事
Get on with it!


635
00:36:55.858 --> 00:36:56.692
破好了
That's it.


636
00:36:57.985 --> 00:36:59.278
我开始读了
Let me see what's written.


637
00:37:02.698 --> 00:37:03.532
该死
Dammit.


638
00:37:04.367 --> 00:37:05.201
是暗语
It's a code.


639
00:37:06.535 --> 00:37:09.247
这是只有高丽武官们知道的军营密码
It's an old military cipher only used by Goryeo officers.


640
00:37:10.915 --> 00:37:11.874
最后的武士
Were you a private?


641
00:37:13.251 --> 00:37:14.377
是兵卒吗？
Private Last Warrior?


642
00:37:17.755 --> 00:37:19.507
兵卒 最底部
Private The Very Bottom.


643
00:37:20.675 --> 00:37:21.509
查到了吗？
- What have you found out?


644
00:37:22.301 --> 00:37:23.344
早些时候
I searched for General Joo Bang,


645
00:37:23.427 --> 00:37:27.139
根据内侍府战死者追溯到了将帅朱芳
starting with those who died in battle


646
00:37:25.513 --> 00:37:27.139
from the Office of Internal Affairs.

647
00:37:28.266 --> 00:37:29.684
那天有三者消失
Three things disappeared that day.


648
00:37:30.393 --> 00:37:31.560
第一个是将帅朱芳
- First was General Joo Bang.


649
00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:35.022
第二个是高丽王室的财宝
Second was the treasure of the imperial family of Goryeo


650
00:37:36.565 --> 00:37:37.692
最后一个
- And the last鈥?


651
00:37:38.317 --> 00:37:39.318
是朱芳的妻子
鈥?was Joo Bang's wife.


652
00:37:41.070 --> 00:37:42.863
是啊 朱芳也得有靠山
Of course, Joo Bang must have had someone backing him.


653
00:37:43.572 --> 00:37:44.615
找到他的妻子了吗？
Did you find his wife?


654
00:37:45.283 --> 00:37:46.450
她剪了头发
She shaved her head鈥?


655
00:37:47.201 --> 00:37:48.744
成了修女
- 鈥nd became a Buddhist nun.


656
00:37:48.828 --> 00:37:52.206
看来你搜遍了八道的所有寺庙和庵子
Goodness. You must have searched every temple and hermitage in the country.


657
00:37:52.873 --> 00:37:53.708
所以
What happened?


658
00:37:54.333 --> 00:37:56.127
她说了宝物在哪里吗？
Did she tell you where the treasure is?


659
00:38:00.381 --> 00:38:01.215
在哪里？
So, where鈥?


660
00:38:03.509 --> 00:38:04.343
那个地方
is it?


661
00:38:07.138 --> 00:38:08.139
海吉洞？
"Haegildo"?


662
00:38:09.140 --> 00:38:12.810
无影岩石下的海洞？
"A sea cave beneath a rock with no shadow."


663
00:38:12.893 --> 00:38:13.728
海吉洞？
"Haegildo"?


664
00:38:14.395 --> 00:38:15.938
那条险峻的海路？
Isn't that the p-perilous sea route?


665
00:38:16.022 --> 00:38:18.316
大海还能有多险峻？
The sea is the sea, however perilous it is.


666
00:38:18.399 --> 00:38:19.900
-不懂就别乱说 -有宝物？
- You don't know anything about it. - There's treasure?


667
00:38:20.568 --> 00:38:21.402
那边的水…
The鈥?the water goes--


668
00:38:21.485 --> 00:38:25.072
他住在狭窄的土地上 能知道些什么？
Hey! Since you've lived trapped on that cramped land, you don't know anything.


669
00:38:25.156 --> 00:38:26.824
那个地方
The whirlpools there, they keep swirling, and鈥?


670
00:38:26.907 --> 00:38:29.910
大海里流着漩涡

671
00:38:29.994 --> 00:38:32.455
江河流淌在海上啊
A river flows under the ocean!


672
00:38:34.290 --> 00:38:36.334
屎就是屎 屁就是屁
Poop is poop and farts are farts.


673
00:38:36.417 --> 00:38:38.461
江河怎么会流淌在海上？
How can a river flow under the sea?


674
00:38:38.544 --> 00:38:39.795
就是在流淌啊！
I'm telling you it flows!


675
00:38:40.379 --> 00:38:41.255
你这小子
Why you little--


676
00:38:41.339 --> 00:38:42.590
流淌
It flows!


677
00:38:44.967 --> 00:38:45.885
-流淌 -也是
- It flows, it flows. - Forgive me.


678
00:38:47.470 --> 00:38:48.471
拉稀屎确实会流淌
There's diarrhea too.


679
00:38:49.013 --> 00:38:51.307
问题是不知道这条河有多长
The problem is that we don't know how long the river is.


680
00:38:51.390 --> 00:38:53.934
没有人被卷走后脱身成功
In other words, no one's gone under and come out the other end.


681
00:38:54.643 --> 00:38:56.187
那我就不去了 放弃
Well, then I'm not going. I give up. I give up.


682
00:38:57.396 --> 00:38:58.647
团长 咱别去了
Captain, let's not go.


683
00:39:01.025 --> 00:39:02.318
-副团长 -在
- First mate! - Yes?


684
00:39:03.652 --> 00:39:05.613
把船停到岸边 抓十头猪来
Bring the boat to shore and catch ten pigs.


685
00:39:06.739 --> 00:39:07.573
是
- Yes.


686
00:39:08.282 --> 00:39:10.618
- Raise the sails!

687
00:39:10.493 --> 00:39:11.619
扬帆起航！

688
00:39:13.329 --> 00:39:15.331
使劲拉！

689
00:39:23.130 --> 00:39:24.465
如果你说的是事实
If what you're saying is true,


690
00:39:25.216 --> 00:39:27.176
那的确是巨大的宝物
it surely is an amazing amount of treasure.


691
00:39:28.761 --> 00:39:30.012
你想从我这里得到什么？
What do you want in return?


692
00:39:31.430 --> 00:39:32.765
请您成为朝鲜的国王
Become the king of Joseon.


693
00:39:40.022 --> 00:39:40.898
Yah!

694
00:39:41.774 --> 00:39:42.775
你呢？
And you?


695
00:39:45.361 --> 00:39:47.029
我要成为耽罗之王
I want to be the king of Tamna.


696
00:40:05.464 --> 00:40:07.133
一路平安啊 头目！
Enjoy your trip, Boss!


697
00:40:07.216 --> 00:40:08.676
一路平安！
Bye!


698
00:40:09.218 --> 00:40:10.469
路上保重！

699
00:40:12.054 --> 00:40:13.764
那个漩涡是什么？
Oh no. What is that whirpool, huh?


700
00:40:14.849 --> 00:40:15.724
Whoa!

701
00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:19.562
海下流淌的江河不知尽头
There's no way of knowing where the river under the sea ends.


702
00:40:19.645 --> 00:40:21.272
千万别弄丢那个包袱
Do not let go of your pouch.


703
00:40:24.567 --> 00:40:25.985
Yah! Yah!

704
00:40:34.493 --> 00:40:36.495
说不定会死 你不害怕吗？
You said we might die. Are you afraid?


705
00:40:37.663 --> 00:40:39.582
胆小者不该带领团队
Someone so afraid shouldn't be a leader.


706
00:40:41.584 --> 00:40:43.794
老大要怕死才行
Uh鈥?


707
00:40:41.750 --> 00:40:45.254
A leader who's afraid can find a
way for us all to survive together.

708
00:40:43.878 --> 00:40:45.254
那样才会寻找共同生存之道

709
00:40:47.506 --> 00:40:49.925
就是为了共同生存才冒着生命危险
We're risking our lives to survive together.


710
00:40:50.634 --> 00:40:52.094
- Yeah. Sure.

711
00:40:56.974 --> 00:40:57.808
团长
Captain, our boat will be swept away if we go any closer to it.


712
00:40:58.350 --> 00:40:59.977
再靠近的话 船可能被水冲走了

713
00:41:00.561 --> 00:41:02.271
-我们从这里乘河流 -什么？
We'll ride the current from here!


714
00:41:02.354 --> 00:41:03.647
-我们走！ -是！
- Let's go! - Yes, Captain!


715
00:41:04.398 --> 00:41:05.649
-走！ -从这里？

716
00:41:07.526 --> 00:41:08.527
什么味道？
- Ugh. What's this smell? - Go on!


717
00:41:11.363 --> 00:41:13.616
是你们精心擦拭的猪膀胱
They're the pigs bladders that you washed so earnestly.


718
00:41:14.116 --> 00:41:15.826
往里面填满了空气
They're filled with air.


719
00:41:17.828 --> 00:41:18.996
难怪有臊味
- I thought it smelled like piss. - I didn't wash mine thoroughly.


720
00:41:19.079 --> 00:41:20.331
我刚刚没擦干净呢

721
00:41:22.041 --> 00:41:23.334
我好怕 哥哥
I'm so scared, mister.


722
00:41:26.253 --> 00:41:27.713
不行！
No, don't!


723
00:41:30.549 --> 00:41:33.344
你先走吧 我不行了
- You go first.


724
00:41:32.218 --> 00:41:34.220
I can't make it.

725
00:41:34.386 --> 00:41:35.554
快走吧 你这个混蛋！
Hurry up and go, you bastard!


726
00:41:37.097 --> 00:41:40.017
我在这里守着船！
Don't worry! I'll take care of the boat!


727
00:41:40.726 --> 00:41:42.144
你们快去快回！
Have a safe trip!


728
00:43:49.313 --> 00:43:50.147
起来
Get up.


729
00:43:57.279 --> 00:43:58.280
咬紧牙
Clench your teeth.


730
00:44:13.462 --> 00:44:14.505
小幕呢？
Mak-yi?


731
00:44:16.715 --> 00:44:17.549
这小子

732
00:44:18.217 --> 00:44:19.426
脏死了

733
00:44:21.762 --> 00:44:22.596
真臭
That stinks!


734
00:44:24.223 --> 00:44:26.308
团长 这里也没有
Captain, it's not here either.


735
00:44:27.810 --> 00:44:30.145
真是的 宝物到底在哪里？
Really? Just where is the treasure.


736
00:44:30.229 --> 00:44:32.314
哎呀 该死的
I mean, really.


737
00:44:32.398 --> 00:44:33.232
团长
Captain!


738
00:44:33.816 --> 00:44:35.859
没有其他路 全被堵上了
There isn't another path! It's completely blocked off!


739
00:44:36.527 --> 00:44:37.611
没有路也没有宝物
Look harder!


740
00:44:37.695 --> 00:44:39.613
团长 接下来怎么办？
Captain, what's next?


741
00:44:39.697 --> 00:44:42.616
我就怕这样才想卖地图的
This is why I wanted to sell the map, in case this happened.


742
00:44:45.244 --> 00:44:48.580
我以为海浪会有点本领 但她跟那些白痴一样啊
I thought Hae-rang would be different,


743
00:44:48.664 --> 00:44:50.207
还被那个假地图给骗了
but she's just the same as those fools getting tricked by a fake map.


744
00:44:52.126 --> 00:44:54.503
-好饿 -喂 那边也没有吗？
- It's not here either? - Ugh. I'm hungry!


745
00:44:55.212 --> 00:44:56.255
这里也没有
Hey. It's not there either?


746
00:44:57.005 --> 00:44:58.799
-都集合吧 -集合
Hey. Gather around.


747
00:44:59.967 --> 00:45:01.885
-快点 -快集合
Get over here, quickly! He said gather around.


748
00:45:02.386 --> 00:45:03.762
话都说到这份上了
I'm saying it because it came up. If we had sold the map, where would we be?


749
00:45:03.846 --> 00:45:05.556
如果按照我所说 当时卖掉了地图

750
00:45:05.639 --> 00:45:07.516
-他又开始了 -我没说错啊
- Shut up! - I'm not wrong.


751
00:45:07.599 --> 00:45:08.976
团长 要不要再找找？
What should we do? Should we check again?


752
00:45:09.935 --> 00:45:11.854
各位打算怎么办啊？
Okay, okay, okay. What are you gonna do?


753
00:45:13.564 --> 00:45:14.982
你们都只是盯着团长的嘴
They're all waiting for your next order.


754
00:45:20.696 --> 00:45:22.406
既然冒着生命危险带过来
You risked our lives bringing us here, hmm?


755
00:45:23.115 --> 00:45:24.158
无论是绝望
Whether you give them despair or hope,


756
00:45:25.159 --> 00:45:26.034
还是希望

757
00:45:27.953 --> 00:45:29.163
头儿应该负责到底
the leader needs to take responsibility.


758
00:45:32.750 --> 00:45:35.294
海浪 你不是这里的头儿吗？
Hey, Hae-rang. A leader must鈥?


759
00:45:37.254 --> 00:45:38.589
那必须得动动脑
must use their brain. Yeah?


760
00:45:38.672 --> 00:45:40.340
Huh? Did he鈥?

761
00:45:42.634 --> 00:45:44.094
竟敢拔团长的头发
How dare you touch the captain's head!


762
00:45:45.554 --> 00:45:47.473
-看好了 -你这个混蛋！
- Watch closely. - You bastard!


763
00:45:51.435 --> 00:45:52.561
搞什么？
What?


764
00:45:52.644 --> 00:45:53.854
那是什么？
What the hell is that?


765
00:45:53.937 --> 00:45:55.355
终于出来了
How will he kill him?


766
00:45:55.856 --> 00:45:56.774
你死定了
Now you're a goner.


767
00:45:58.901 --> 00:46:00.444
还以为你是头目吗？
You still think you're the boss.


768
00:46:01.987 --> 00:46:03.363
你都没有刀 还能怎么做？
Too bad you don't have your sword.


769
00:46:04.114 --> 00:46:06.074
我从来没输过赤手空拳的战斗
Never in my life have I lost a fistfight.


770
00:46:07.034 --> 00:46:07.868
我也是
Neither have I.


771
00:46:10.037 --> 00:46:11.872
-熊治！ -大哥
Gom-chi!


772
00:46:17.211 --> 00:46:18.212
真粗鲁
- Such imeciles.


773
00:46:25.719 --> 00:46:28.806
我发现路被钟乳石挡住了
I discovered this path that was blocked by a stalactite.


774
00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:30.766
头儿
Captain,


775
00:46:32.184 --> 00:46:33.018
先请
please go ahead.


776
00:46:44.279 --> 00:46:45.697
你生气啦？
Hey. You upset?


777
00:46:46.657 --> 00:46:47.658
-生气了吧？ -好累
You all right?


778
00:46:48.367 --> 00:46:50.244
-一起走啊 -真是的

779
00:46:52.871 --> 00:46:53.705
团长
Whoo!


780
00:46:52.871 --> 00:46:53.705
Captain.

781
00:46:55.666 --> 00:46:57.417
找到了！
What?


782
00:47:06.593 --> 00:47:08.428
这一个顶一百匹丝绸
You could by 100 rolls of silk with just one of these.


783
00:47:08.512 --> 00:47:11.306
-建十座宫殿也绰绰有余 -就是啊
- It's enough to build ten palaces! - I know!


784
00:47:14.142 --> 00:47:14.977
让开
Move.


785
00:47:15.644 --> 00:47:16.478
让开
- Hmm? - Out of the way.


786
00:47:16.979 --> 00:47:18.480
He's acting all haughty again.

787
00:47:19.106 --> 00:47:20.482
太失望了
- I'm a bit disappointed.


788
00:47:21.066 --> 00:47:21.984
我觉得很好啊
Why? I'm happy with it.


789
00:47:22.860 --> 00:47:24.069
为什么只有银瓶？
Why are there only silver bottles?


790
00:47:25.153 --> 00:47:27.698
金片才是高丽王室的宝物之最
The royal treasure should have gold pieces.


791
00:47:27.781 --> 00:47:28.699
金片？
Gold pieces?


792
00:47:28.782 --> 00:47:32.494
这么点儿银瓶箱也就值…
A box of these silver bottles would be worth鈥?


793
00:47:34.288 --> 00:47:35.330
一块金片吧
one piece of gold.


794
00:47:36.957 --> 00:47:38.750
那个金片总共有多少块？
How many gold pieces should there be?


795
00:47:39.376 --> 00:47:40.419
这么小的东西
About this big and this much.


796
00:47:41.044 --> 00:47:42.087
大概这么多？

797
00:47:42.713 --> 00:47:43.589
这么多？
This much.


798
00:47:44.172 --> 00:47:45.173
This鈥?

799
00:47:46.049 --> 00:47:49.553
据说是填满了高丽王室的内房库
It's said that it filled up the entire Royal Treasury of Goryeo's palace.


800
00:47:50.137 --> 00:47:51.555
寻找金片！
We must find the gold!


801
00:47:53.140 --> 00:47:54.308
寻找金片！
Find the gold pieces!


802
00:47:55.434 --> 00:47:57.269
都给我搜！
- Hurry! - Over there!


803
00:47:57.352 --> 00:47:58.270
快去找吧
You aren't lying, are you?


804
00:47:58.896 --> 00:47:59.730
不是开玩笑吧？
I'm honorable. I'm Wu Mu-chi.


805
00:47:59.813 --> 00:48:01.899
把我看成什么人了 我可是禹武治

806
00:48:05.527 --> 00:48:06.403
这是
What is this?


807
00:48:07.487 --> 00:48:08.572
什么？
This isn't a flag they use in military camps.


808
00:48:08.655 --> 00:48:10.782
这不是军营里使用的旗帜

809
00:48:17.497 --> 00:48:20.584
乍一看像鬼怪的脸
At first glance, it looks like the face of a goblin,


810
00:48:20.667 --> 00:48:23.045
-但仔细看… -如何？
but when you look at it up close鈥?


811
00:48:21.752 --> 00:48:23.045
When you look at it up close?

812
00:48:25.339 --> 00:48:26.256
不清楚
I have no idea.


813
00:48:27.132 --> 00:48:27.966
让开
Get out of the way.


814
00:48:39.186 --> 00:48:40.312
发生地震了！
It's an earthquake!


815
00:48:40.395 --> 00:48:42.230
-团长 地震了 -快点搬
Captain, it's an earthquake!


816
00:48:42.314 --> 00:48:44.441
阿贵和熊治回船上去拿更多的绳子
A-gwi, Gom-chi, go back to the boat and bring more rope.


817
00:48:44.524 --> 00:48:46.443
是 熊治 快跟我来！
Yes, captain. Gom-chi, hurry! Follow me!


818
00:48:46.526 --> 00:48:47.361
快点行动！

819
00:48:57.120 --> 00:48:58.163
躲开！
Everyone, get back!


820
00:49:16.974 --> 00:49:17.849
有人来了
Someone's here.


821
00:49:23.730 --> 00:49:24.898
停
Halt.


822
00:49:29.027 --> 00:49:29.986
Yes, sir.

823
00:49:41.373 --> 00:49:42.541
你也搬啊
- Huh? - Help move these.


824
00:49:44.418 --> 00:49:46.336
这是什么？这不是航海图吗？
Wait. Isn't this a鈥?a sea chart?


825
00:49:48.380 --> 00:49:49.214
航海图？
What? A map?


826
00:49:49.297 --> 00:49:51.133
朝鲜 倭国
Joseon, Japan.


827
00:49:53.885 --> 00:49:54.720
这是
And h-here is


828
00:49:55.470 --> 00:49:58.682
-稻妻岛 -什么岛？
Inazuma Island.


829
00:49:57.055 --> 00:49:58.682
Inazu鈥?w-what鈥?zuma?

830
00:50:03.103 --> 00:50:04.187
往池塘跑！
Run back to the pond!


831
00:50:05.856 --> 00:50:07.274
加快速度 快点！
Hurry up! Come on, quickly!


832
00:50:50.484 --> 00:50:52.527
-团长呢？ -洞穴深处
- What about the captain? - Still in the cave.


833
00:50:58.325 --> 00:50:59.326
搞什么？
What the鈥?


834
00:51:16.259 --> 00:51:18.011
-还好吗？ -疼死了
- You okay? - Ah, it hurts, dammit!


835
00:51:30.857 --> 00:51:32.442
团长
Captain! Captain!


836
00:51:37.489 --> 00:51:38.740
赶紧带团长离开！
Get the captain out of here!


837
00:51:41.868 --> 00:51:42.911
抓住他们！
Get them!


838
00:52:06.518 --> 00:52:07.644
禹武治
Wu Mu-chi.


839
00:52:08.395 --> 00:52:10.313
你这该死的盗贼！
You bandit scum!


840
00:52:25.287 --> 00:52:26.955
我是来自耽罗的军官夫兴秀
Officer Bu Heung-su of Tamna.


841
00:52:28.331 --> 00:52:30.417
过来报告斩敌将之首的功劳
Reporting the successful decapitation of the enemy general.


842
00:52:48.560 --> 00:52:50.395
整备队伍 准备夜袭
Prepare for battle! We attack them at nightfall.


843
00:52:50.478 --> 00:52:51.313
请听令！
Reporting!


844
00:52:53.565 --> 00:52:56.651
请护送伤兵 搭建营地
I have a direct order! Evacuate the wounded and make camp.


845
00:52:56.735 --> 00:52:58.945
敌营就在眼前 趁夜色突袭的话…
The enemy line is closeby. We ambush them tonight and--


846
00:52:59.029 --> 00:53:00.113
请听令
It's an order!


847
00:53:00.197 --> 00:53:03.366
先护送伤兵 搭建营地…
Evacuate the wounded first and make camp--


848
00:53:05.869 --> 00:53:07.495
回去转告这里没有伤兵
Deliver the message that we have no wounded.


849
00:53:08.955 --> 00:53:09.789
在我的军队里
There are only two kinds of men in my unit.


850
00:53:10.290 --> 00:53:13.543
只有战士和死者

851
00:53:12.500 --> 00:53:13.543
Fighting or dead.

852
00:53:14.211 --> 00:53:15.712
你杀了伤兵并继续前进了吗？
You marched on after killing the wounded?


853
00:53:17.714 --> 00:53:19.507
战争不就是这样的吗？
Isn't that how war is?


854
00:53:19.591 --> 00:53:21.885
你亲手杀了你的手下？
You killed your own men with your own hands?


855
00:53:23.637 --> 00:53:25.263
不过我带来了敌将的头
In exchange, I offer the general's head.


856
00:53:25.347 --> 00:53:26.514
主上殿下答应过你
His Majesty promised to make you king of Tamna


857
00:53:26.598 --> 00:53:29.559
若砍下敌将的头 就让你成为耽罗王吧？
if you brought him the enemy's head, correct?


858
00:53:29.643 --> 00:53:30.852
你很了解嘛
What of it?


859
00:53:30.936 --> 00:53:33.063
禽兽不如者不能任其为王
I won't allow a man like you to become king.


860
00:53:33.146 --> 00:53:34.564
我将依照军法处决你
You'll be punished according to military law.


861
00:53:34.648 --> 00:53:35.941
捆绑夫兴秀！
Arrest and bind him, now!


862
00:53:36.024 --> 00:53:37.192
-是！ -是！
Yes, sir!


863
00:53:37.275 --> 00:53:38.818
你这个肮脏的盗贼
You dirty thief.


864
00:53:39.319 --> 00:53:41.488
你想杀掉我 夺走我的功劳吗？
You'll kill me and take credit for my success?


865
00:53:42.072 --> 00:53:44.324
-把剑放下 -我决不让出我的功劳！
- Lower your sword. - I don't intend to hand the credit to you!


866
00:54:01.508 --> 00:54:02.550
该死
Again a mistake.


867
00:54:05.929 --> 00:54:06.763
你需要宝物吗？
So you need treasure, do you?


868
00:54:11.017 --> 00:54:12.310
Watch out!

869
00:54:14.771 --> 00:54:17.023
你走一步 我就扔一箱
Another one goes in for each step you take.


870
00:54:19.901 --> 00:54:22.112
你又要偷走我的东西吗？
Will you steal what is mine, you aging thief?


871
00:54:23.613 --> 00:54:26.157
要是你还贪得无厌的话
If you still covet what is out of your reach.


872
00:54:28.702 --> 00:54:29.703
要不是因为你
If not for you and your men,


873
00:54:30.203 --> 00:54:32.664
我早就成为国王了
I would've already been a king.


874
00:54:34.582 --> 00:54:35.417
国王？
A king?


875
00:54:37.419 --> 00:54:39.921
连禽兽都不如的人当什么王？
How can someone who's lower than a beast be a king?


876
00:54:40.422 --> 00:54:41.840
下地狱吧！
You can go to hell!


877
00:54:43.717 --> 00:54:46.052
宝物！
Whoa, whoa!


878
00:54:44.968 --> 00:54:46.052
The treasure!

879
00:54:48.805 --> 00:54:50.056
Whoa!

880
00:54:51.433 --> 00:54:52.642
大哥！
Captain!


881
00:55:37.562 --> 00:55:38.396
对不起
Sorry.


882
00:55:51.868 --> 00:55:52.702
怎么不上来？
Why aren't they coming up?


883
00:55:53.787 --> 00:55:55.288
团长不会出事了吧？
Do you think something happened to the captain?


884
00:55:55.955 --> 00:55:56.790
我得下去看看
I better go down there.


885
00:55:57.123 --> 00:55:58.541
The rope!

886
00:55:59.501 --> 00:56:00.502
-抓绳子了 -快点
- Come on! - Get them up!


887
00:56:00.585 --> 00:56:02.045
-拉上来！ -拉上来！

888
00:56:02.128 --> 00:56:03.088
Pull!

889
00:57:47.567 --> 00:57:48.401
团长！
Captain!


890
00:57:50.904 --> 00:57:52.280
头目！
Boss!


891
00:58:02.165 --> 00:58:03.291
谢谢你 团长
Thank you, Captain.


892
00:58:04.459 --> 00:58:05.668
走好 头目
Farewell, Boss.


893
00:58:06.377 --> 00:58:07.921
一定去了好地方
She's gone to a better place.


894
00:58:10.173 --> 00:58:11.132
航海图去哪儿了？
Where did the sea chart go?


895
00:58:20.558 --> 00:58:21.768
团长呢？
Where's the captain?


896
00:58:23.436 --> 00:58:24.437
团长呢？
Where's the captain?


897
00:58:25.021 --> 00:58:25.855
那边
- Huh?


898
00:58:27.774 --> 00:58:28.608
Whoa!

899
00:58:36.950 --> 00:58:38.535
不是那边 是这边！
Not that way! This way, this way!


900
00:58:43.998 --> 00:58:45.833
等等 宝物呢？
Wait, wait! What about the silver?


901
00:58:45.917 --> 00:58:47.794
鲸鱼
- The whale! The whale! - Whale?


902
00:58:51.047 --> 00:58:52.590
是宝物！

903
00:59:01.266 --> 00:59:02.308
不是这个
No! Not this!


904
00:59:03.977 --> 00:59:06.062
把宝物吐出来
Give us the treasure!


905
00:59:24.289 --> 00:59:25.290
大哥 这是什么？
What's that, Captain?


906
00:59:55.486 --> 00:59:56.321
原来是航海图
It was a sea chart.


907
01:00:02.660 --> 01:00:04.746
我正在收拾东西
I thought I should sort some of your things.


908
01:00:05.955 --> 01:00:07.498
你偷了很多嘛
Seems like you're stealing as well.


909
01:00:08.750 --> 01:00:11.044
我没有偷 只是收拾的时候
I'm not stealing them, I was just sorting them out.


910
01:00:12.211 --> 01:00:14.464
这些东西总是粘在一起
- These just got all tangled together.


911
01:00:16.299 --> 01:00:17.508
身体好点了吗？
How are you feeling, Captain?


912
01:00:17.592 --> 01:00:19.135
托你的福 头也开始疼了
Thanks to you my head hurts now.


913
01:00:20.219 --> 01:00:23.514
话说这些衣服又特别又好看
These clothes are really quite pretty, but strange.


914
01:00:24.182 --> 01:00:26.184
西域大海里有很多奇怪的东西
There are a lot of unusual things in western seas.


915
01:00:27.185 --> 01:00:28.269
这里只有我一个女人
I'm the only woman on board,


916
01:00:29.270 --> 01:00:31.606
这段时间积攒的东西都堆满了仓库
so everything I've gathered is piled up in the storage.


917
01:00:32.231 --> 01:00:33.066
挑你喜欢的穿吧
You can wear whatever you want.


918
01:00:37.487 --> 01:00:39.614
您好好休息吧
Then please get some rest.


919
01:00:41.616 --> 01:00:43.034
你腰上缠上的东西
The things hanging from my belt,


920
01:00:44.577 --> 01:00:46.371
是先牺牲的兄弟们的遗物
they were inherited from brothers who've already died.


921
01:00:48.164 --> 01:00:49.499
对我来说比什么都珍贵
They are my prized possessions.


922
01:00:52.418 --> 01:00:53.419
天呐
Oh dear.


923
01:00:54.295 --> 01:00:55.129
Oh crap.

924
01:01:02.095 --> 01:01:03.304
拿去
They're yours.


925
01:01:07.392 --> 01:01:08.726
我会尽忠的
I pledge my loyalty--


926
01:01:08.810 --> 01:01:09.936
尽忠什么
What loyalty?


927
01:01:10.978 --> 01:01:12.897
只是互相依靠罢了
We find ourselves in the same situation.


928
01:01:12.980 --> 01:01:14.774
所以必须相互坦诚
That's why we should be honest with each other.


929
01:01:15.525 --> 01:01:18.277
既然上了同一条船 你也依靠大家吧
I hope you realize that you can depend on us.


930
01:01:19.696 --> 01:01:20.655
不要一个人费心思
Don't struggle on your own.


931
01:01:26.327 --> 01:01:28.913
没关系 我们都是女贼嘛
What does it matter between two thieving women?


932
01:01:31.999 --> 01:01:33.376
总从哪儿掉呢
These just keep falling out of nowhere.


933
01:01:36.212 --> 01:01:37.588
都干什么呢 天亮了
What are you doing? The sun's up.


934
01:01:38.756 --> 01:01:40.258
鲷儿 你少喝点酒
Do-mi, you better stop drinking so much.


935
01:01:55.565 --> 01:01:56.399
身体怎么样？
You okay?


936
01:02:00.903 --> 01:02:01.988
瞅什么？
What?


937
01:02:03.239 --> 01:02:05.742
宝物有那么好吗？死了就都没了
Do you love treasure that much? You could've died out there.


938
01:02:07.118 --> 01:02:08.411
是大家都想要的
We all wanted it, Mu-chi.


939
01:02:10.079 --> 01:02:12.415
要是赌上我的命可以得到它 就不觉得可惜
It's worth it, even if getting it means risking my life.


940
01:02:12.498 --> 01:02:14.125
命都没了 拿到它又有什么用？
What will you do with it once you have it?


941
01:02:14.792 --> 01:02:15.626
算了
Stop it!


942
01:02:16.461 --> 01:02:17.462
你又不懂
You wouldn't understand.


943
01:02:22.967 --> 01:02:23.926
我不懂什么？
What would I not understand?


944
01:02:25.636 --> 01:02:27.764
我们都是同舟共济的家人
We're a big family out here on the ocean.


945
01:02:28.389 --> 01:02:30.641
不只是船上有家人
But the ship isn't the only place where family is.


946
01:02:31.726 --> 01:02:32.727
船外也有
We have family elsewhere.


947
01:02:33.936 --> 01:02:35.855
有先死者的家人
The family of those who've died before us,


948
01:02:36.689 --> 01:02:38.274
也有新的家人会加入
and more family to come in the future.


949
01:02:39.901 --> 01:02:40.735
现在的我
Right now鈥?


950
01:02:42.570 --> 01:02:44.489
帮不了他们
there's nothing I can do for those people.


951
01:02:48.868 --> 01:02:50.411
是身为团长要肩负的责任吗？
Is that your responsibility as captain?


952
01:02:52.288 --> 01:02:53.122
这可真是
That's some鈥?


953
01:02:55.249 --> 01:02:56.375
头疼啊
pain in the neck.


954
01:02:57.126 --> 01:02:57.960
问你一个问题
I want to know!


955
01:03:00.129 --> 01:03:02.590
你为什么认为宝物会是金片？
Why did you think the treasure would be gold pieces?


956
01:03:03.424 --> 01:03:05.802
如果像象牙上写的那样 足以重建高丽的话
If the tusk is right and it's supposed to be enough to rebuild Goryeo,


957
01:03:06.719 --> 01:03:08.679
那得是内房库的金片才行
it would be all the gold pieces in the Royal Treasury.


958
01:03:08.763 --> 01:03:11.808
-金片？ -你把那个鬼怪旗帜放哪儿了？
- Gold pieces? - And what about that goblin flag?


959
01:03:15.061 --> 01:03:16.229
在洞里呗
It's back in the cave.


960
01:03:17.104 --> 01:03:17.939
调头
Turn around. We're going back to the cave to get the flag.


961
01:03:18.439 --> 01:03:19.941
返回洞穴 拿回旗帜

962
01:03:20.024 --> 01:03:21.526
-什么？ -嗯？
- What? - Huh?


963
01:03:21.609 --> 01:03:23.402
那个旗帜的反面是航海图
That flag is an inverted sea chart.


964
01:03:24.779 --> 01:03:26.113
说不定是隐藏内房库黄金的
A sea chart?


965
01:03:24.779 --> 01:03:26.531
It might be a map to the treasure,

966
01:03:27.073 --> 01:03:28.658
藏宝图
to the Royal Treasury's gold.


967
01:03:28.741 --> 01:03:30.034
藏宝图？

968
01:03:31.410 --> 01:03:33.204
调头！
Turn the ship around! Turn the ship around!


969
01:03:33.704 --> 01:03:35.581
快行动！
No. No!


970
01:03:35.665 --> 01:03:37.875
不是的
No, no, no, no, no, no.


971
01:03:37.959 --> 01:03:39.669
-不是？ -你是谁？
- No? - No?


972
01:03:39.752 --> 01:03:40.586
不用回去了
There's no need to go back.


973
01:03:40.670 --> 01:03:43.089
-您哪位？ -赶紧交出来啊
- What are you doing? - Just hand it over.


974
01:03:43.965 --> 01:03:46.008
-什么？ -你拿了鬼怪旗帜嘛
- Hand what over? - You have it, the goblin flag.


975
01:03:46.092 --> 01:03:47.009
你说什么？
What was that?


976
01:03:48.928 --> 01:03:50.221
不是的
I don't.


977
01:03:50.304 --> 01:03:52.098
- What? Hey! 
- You鈥?

978
01:03:52.265 --> 01:03:53.975
把它藏哪儿了？
Where did you hide it?


979
01:03:55.476 --> 01:03:56.602
-等等 -把它藏哪儿了？
- Wait a minute! - Where did you hide it?


980
01:03:57.395 --> 01:03:58.729
为什么从我这找藏宝…
Fine! The treasure鈥?


981
01:03:59.814 --> 01:04:00.815
翻他身子
Search him!


982
01:04:00.898 --> 01:04:03.609
-过来 臭小子 -扒掉衣服
- Come here, you!


983
01:04:03.693 --> 01:04:05.987
-扒光他 -丢了 我弄丢了！
- Strip off all his clothes. - I lost it!


984
01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:09.490
干脆杀掉我吧
Just kill me instead!


985
01:04:09.574 --> 01:04:11.200
我们小幕吃了不少苦头吧
You must be having a rough time, huh?


986
01:04:12.368 --> 01:04:13.452
团长
- Captain, please.


987
01:04:14.495 --> 01:04:16.581
-真可怜 -我太难了
- You poor thing. - It's been so hard.


988
01:04:17.665 --> 01:04:19.292
- Blow.

989
01:04:20.251 --> 01:04:22.169
你们都太坏了
Have some heart. How could you be so cruel to Mak-yi?


990
01:04:22.253 --> 01:04:24.714
太坏了
Make it stop. End this cruelty.


991
01:04:25.423 --> 01:04:28.050
太坏了
So cruel.


992
01:04:33.931 --> 01:04:36.225
我们小幕看过地图吧
The goblin map. You saw it, right?


993
01:04:36.809 --> 01:04:39.228
你看到类似标记点的东西吗？
Did you happen to see any of the markings?


994
01:04:40.271 --> 01:04:41.105
Yes.

995
01:04:41.898 --> 01:04:42.982
位置呢？
The location?


996
01:04:44.025 --> 01:04:45.276
稻妻岛
The island of Inazuma.


997
01:04:47.236 --> 01:04:48.070
什么？
What "ma"?


998
01:04:50.448 --> 01:04:51.282
翻译过来就是
In our language, it's, um, "Beongaesum."


999
01:04:52.366 --> 01:04:53.951
-闪电岛 -闪电岛？
- Beongaesum? - Beongaes--.


1000
01:04:54.035 --> 01:04:54.869
闪电
- Hey.


1001
01:04:54.952 --> 01:04:55.786
喂

1002
01:04:56.537 --> 01:04:58.080
你说的是那个闪电岛吗？
Wait. The Beongaesum from the stories?


1003
01:04:59.165 --> 01:05:02.293
每天都会出现数千次雷云
Are you joking?


1004
01:05:00.124 --> 01:05:03.002
Storm clouds rain down lightning
there 1,000 times a day.

1005
01:05:02.376 --> 01:05:03.794
每打一次闪电
Every time it comes down, it's ten years' worth of lightning in one go,


1006
01:05:03.878 --> 01:05:07.298
就有十年的量噼里啪啦打下来

1007
01:05:07.381 --> 01:05:09.467
十年的量？皮痒痒了吧
like pop, pop, pop!


1008
01:05:07.381 --> 01:05:09.467
Ten years worth? Bullshit!

1009
01:05:09.550 --> 01:05:10.801
我是说真的
Hey. It's true, okay?


1010
01:05:10.885 --> 01:05:11.719
那个地方在哪？
Where is it, then?


1011
01:05:13.262 --> 01:05:15.097
我也只是听说过 还没去过
I've only heard of it. I've never been there.


1012
01:05:15.181 --> 01:05:16.891
你没去过还说什么 臭小子？
- Never been there?


1013
01:05:16.974 --> 01:05:18.059
是真的
- You little-- - He's not lying.


1014
01:05:19.101 --> 01:05:20.603
原来团长您去过
Oh. So you've been there, Captain?


1015
01:05:21.479 --> 01:05:24.649
有时整个天空都会布满闪电
Sometimes, the whole sky fills up with lightning as far as the eye can see.


1016
01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:28.945
-看来会很壮观 -我也没有看过
It sounds like quite the spectacle.


1017
01:05:27.568 --> 01:05:29.403
I've never actually seen it either.

1018
01:05:33.532 --> 01:05:34.700
偏偏是闪电岛
It had to be Beongaesum.


1019
01:05:37.411 --> 01:05:38.829
船帆会被旋风撕裂
Swirling winds rip the sails,


1020
01:05:39.455 --> 01:05:40.581
桅杆也会被雷劈断
the lightning snaps the mast.


1021
01:05:43.376 --> 01:05:44.835
简直是人间地狱
It's a living hell among hells.


1022
01:05:52.927 --> 01:05:54.345
你听谁说的？
And who told you that?


1023
01:05:54.428 --> 01:05:55.930
我可是生于海的海人
Despite how I look, I'm a man of the oceans.


1024
01:05:56.931 --> 01:05:58.557
出生在倭寇船上 从吸母乳开始
I was born on a pirate ship, traveling the oceans since suckling my mother's breast.


1025
01:05:58.641 --> 01:06:00.559
就在各个海域游荡

1026
01:06:00.643 --> 01:06:01.602
等一下
Hang on.


1027
01:06:02.436 --> 01:06:04.021
那你知道路吧？
That means you know the way?


1028
01:06:09.276 --> 01:06:10.486
天呐
Jeez鈥?


1029
01:06:12.154 --> 01:06:13.531
真可笑
This is ridiculous.


1030
01:06:20.121 --> 01:06:21.205
Woohoo!

1031
01:06:21.872 --> 01:06:22.748
那个是什么？
What is that big, bad boy?


1032
01:06:22.832 --> 01:06:26.127
据说是明太祖为了讨伐倭寇
That's the Fire Dragon Cannon


1033
01:06:24.625 --> 01:06:26.669
that the Emperor Hongwu bestowed upon King Gongmin

1034
01:06:26.210 --> 01:06:27.753
而赐给恭愍王的火龙炮
to suppress the Japanese pirates.


1035
01:06:28.295 --> 01:06:30.214
我们不是要去寻宝吗？
Weren't we after treasure?


1036
01:06:30.297 --> 01:06:31.590
海里只有倭寇吗？
There's more than just Japanese pirates.


1037
01:06:32.550 --> 01:06:34.343
还有那些海盗
Yeah. Those other pirate bastards.


1038
01:06:34.427 --> 01:06:35.261
大哥
Captain, if I may,


1039
01:06:35.761 --> 01:06:38.222
我想试试那个大家伙
I'm gonna give this bad boy a try.


1040
01:06:38.848 --> 01:06:39.682
我也一起去
- Me too!


1041
01:06:40.474 --> 01:06:41.517
那么喜欢杀生吗？
Do you like killing that much?


1042
01:06:42.268 --> 01:06:44.353
那不就是活着的乐趣嘛
Isn't that the joy of life?


1043
01:06:46.647 --> 01:06:47.690
让开
Out of the way. Out of the way!


1044
01:06:47.773 --> 01:06:48.816
走开
Get out!


1045
01:06:55.614 --> 01:06:58.367
随着乌云
With a blanket of dark clouds, the entire sky is filled with lightning,


1046
01:06:58.451 --> 01:06:59.618
满天闪电
like zap, zap, zap, zap, zap.


1047
01:06:59.702 --> 01:07:01.287
噼里啪啦

1048
01:07:01.370 --> 01:07:03.205
所以到底在哪里？
So where is this exactly, huh?


1049
01:07:04.790 --> 01:07:07.209
怎么总打断我？这样下去要熬夜了
Will you quit interrupting? We'll be up all night at this rate.


1050
01:07:07.877 --> 01:07:09.420
-臭小子 -团长
- This bastard! - Whoa! Captain!


1051
01:07:09.503 --> 01:07:10.755
你怎么老打断话！
Stop cutting him off!


1052
01:07:13.966 --> 01:07:14.800
好
Okay.


1053
01:07:18.262 --> 01:07:19.305
我说到哪儿了？
Where was I?


1054
01:07:20.723 --> 01:07:23.142
反正那个地方去不得 去了就会死
Anyway, we can't go there. We'll definitely die if we do.


1055
01:07:23.684 --> 01:07:26.145
知道了 你说的话都听懂了
Okay, I understand. So why don't you just tell us just the location. All right?


1056
01:07:26.228 --> 01:07:27.563
赶紧说位置吧 好吗？
- Hmm? - I told you we'll all die.


1057
01:07:28.147 --> 01:07:29.190
会死的
You're a good boy. Right, Mak-yi?


1058
01:07:29.273 --> 01:07:32.193
听话啊 小幕 我不会去的

1059
01:07:32.276 --> 01:07:33.861
就告诉我位置吧
We won't go. So tell me, where is it?


1060
01:07:33.944 --> 01:07:36.072
既然不去 还问位置干吗？
If you're not going, why do you need the location?


1061
01:07:36.155 --> 01:07:37.031
臭小子
- This bastard!


1062
01:07:37.907 --> 01:07:38.783
真憋得慌
- Give me a sword. I'll just kill him now. - Here, Captain.


1063
01:07:38.866 --> 01:07:40.659
给我一把刀 我要杀了他

1064
01:07:40.743 --> 01:07:41.702
给您

1065
01:07:45.247 --> 01:07:46.248
咱别去了 团长
Let's not go there, Captain.


1066
01:07:46.332 --> 01:07:48.709
那片海太汹涌了 仅凭勇气是不行的
Those waters sound too dangerous to cross with mere courage.


1067
01:07:48.793 --> 01:07:49.710
就是
Yeah. That's what I'm saying.


1068
01:07:50.252 --> 01:07:52.463
别的地方就算了 但如果是怕海
To be afraid of the sea, of all places, you can't call yourself a pirate. Can you?


1069
01:07:52.546 --> 01:07:54.632
-那还算海盗吗？ -那是渔夫

1070
01:07:54.715 --> 01:07:58.135
我们是海盗 海盗即大海！
He's a fisherman.


1071
01:07:55.299 --> 01:07:58.135
We are pirates, and the
open sea is our domain!

1072
01:07:58.219 --> 01:08:00.471
黄金在等着我们！
The gold is waiting for us!


1073
01:08:00.971 --> 01:08:05.142
-走 我们去寻宝！ -我们走！
No one can stop us, not even ourselves!


1074
01:08:01.931 --> 01:08:04.058
- To find the treasure!

1075
01:08:04.141 --> 01:08:05.142
Let's go!

1076
01:08:05.810 --> 01:08:07.770
若带我们去闪电岛
If you guide us to Bongaesum,


1077
01:08:07.853 --> 01:08:09.563
就把十分之一的宝物给你
you can keep a tenth of the treasure there.


1078
01:08:11.357 --> 01:08:13.109
Why would we give it to him?

1079
01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:15.945
死后黄金有什么用？
Give it to me now, while I'm still alive.


1080
01:08:17.404 --> 01:08:19.573
如果想给 就在死前给
If I'm dead, what good is gold?


1081
01:08:19.657 --> 01:08:21.408
你有什么想要的吗？
Is there something else?


1082
01:08:23.285 --> 01:08:26.580
这条船上能有值得拿命换的东西吗？
There's nothing here worth exchanging your life for?


1083
01:08:27.164 --> 01:08:29.667
并不是没有
Well, it's not that there isn't anything I want.


1084
01:08:29.750 --> 01:08:31.794
但也不会给我的
It's not like you're going to give it to me, so鈥?


1085
01:08:31.877 --> 01:08:32.837
那是什么？
What is it, then?


1086
01:08:35.923 --> 01:08:37.091
那个…
It's鈥?


1087
01:08:38.217 --> 01:08:39.510
不好开口
I can't bring myself to say it.


1088
01:08:40.302 --> 01:08:41.679
说说看
What is it? Say it!


1089
01:08:42.513 --> 01:08:44.473
-只有我一个人知道路线 -是啊
- Only I know how to get there. - Yes, indeed.


1090
01:08:45.182 --> 01:08:47.268
-只有我去过那里 -知道
- Only I have been there. - We know, we know.


1091
01:08:47.351 --> 01:08:48.686
那样的话
With that in mind鈥?See鈥?


1092
01:08:50.396 --> 01:08:51.772
吓我一跳
I got it!


1093
01:08:54.108 --> 01:08:55.359
看来你想当团长
You want to become the captain.


1094
01:08:56.068 --> 01:08:57.444
- What?

1095
01:09:03.409 --> 01:09:05.911
因为生前一直受欺负是一种耻辱
It's unfair for me to die after being treated like this.


1096
01:09:05.995 --> 01:09:08.539
就算是找到宝物之前也好
So just at least until we find the treasure,


1097
01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:10.875
海盗王…
Pirate King.


1098
01:09:10.958 --> 01:09:13.669
这个疯子 你找死吧！
Are you mad? Do you want a swift death?


1099
01:09:16.130 --> 01:09:16.964
放下
Put it down.


1100
01:09:18.424 --> 01:09:19.383
决定权
Shouldn't


1101
01:09:20.926 --> 01:09:21.927
交给团长吧？
the captain decide?


1102
01:09:24.221 --> 01:09:25.055
怎么了？
Well?


1103
01:09:25.222 --> 01:09:26.182
Ah.

1104
01:09:26.765 --> 01:09:27.600
作为团长
As a captain you can risk your life, but you can't give up your authority, huh?


1105
01:09:28.142 --> 01:09:30.936
可以舍弃生命 但舍弃不了权势吗？

1106
01:09:37.359 --> 01:09:38.360
我问大家
I'll ask everyone!


1107
01:09:40.196 --> 01:09:41.447
只有二选一
You can choose one or the other.


1108
01:09:43.365 --> 01:09:45.951
一 答应小幕的请求并寻宝
Shall we go find the treasure after fulfilling Mak-yi's request?


1109
01:09:46.535 --> 01:09:49.330
二 立即杀了这家伙并整顿纪律
Or shall we kill him right now to maintain order?


1110
01:09:51.332 --> 01:09:53.000
如果想要宝物
Those of you who want the treasure


1111
01:09:54.543 --> 01:09:55.419
就举手吧
raise your hand.


1112
01:10:01.342 --> 01:10:02.176
团长
Come on, Captain.


1113
01:10:03.510 --> 01:10:04.470
你应该闭上眼睛
You need to close your eyes.


1114
01:10:12.436 --> 01:10:13.270
妈妈
Mother,


1115
01:10:14.271 --> 01:10:15.606
我成了海盗王
I am the Pirate King.


1116
01:10:23.572 --> 01:10:25.783
我向龙王请安
Let me greet the Dragon King!


1117
01:10:26.450 --> 01:10:27.618
我是新任海盗王
I am the new鈥?


1118
01:10:28.452 --> 01:10:32.164
小幕！
Pirate King, Mak-yi!


1119
01:10:36.126 --> 01:10:36.961
团长
Captain,


1120
01:10:37.836 --> 01:10:39.922
这种事就交给手下吧
uh, leave this kind of chore to your subordinates. All right?


1121
01:10:40.506 --> 01:10:42.800
就当是放几天假 好好休息休息
Think of it as a vacation for a few days, and take a break.


1122
01:10:44.093 --> 01:10:46.845
团长在握着舵轮
Dammit!


1123
01:10:44.468 --> 01:10:47.262
The captain is the one
manning the helm, of course.

1124
01:10:47.930 --> 01:10:52.059
请叫我浪儿 副团长
So just call me Rang, the quartermaster.


1125
01:10:52.142 --> 01:10:53.894
团长 别这样啊
Come on, Captain!


1126
01:10:54.561 --> 01:10:55.980
快到晚饭时间了
It's almost dinnertime.


1127
01:10:56.897 --> 01:10:57.898
都出去吧
Off you go!


1128
01:10:59.441 --> 01:11:01.068
团长 您现在这个样子
I mean, how could we possibly do anything


1129
01:11:01.151 --> 01:11:02.987
我们心里也不好受…
when you're down here working, Captain?


1130
01:11:03.070 --> 01:11:03.904
出去！
Get out, dammit!


1131
01:11:08.242 --> 01:11:10.286
-请 -是 浪儿
Please.


1132
01:11:10.369 --> 01:11:11.745
你说浪儿？
Okay, okay, Rang.


1133
01:11:10.411 --> 01:11:13.205
- Rang? Did you say Rang? 
- Come on. She seems upset.

1134
01:11:12.371 --> 01:11:13.205
她生气啦？
Big time.


1135
01:11:13.706 --> 01:11:16.458
-非常生气 -她非常在乎权威
She's sensitive about the situation


1136
01:11:16.542 --> 01:11:19.003
-其实也就几天 -那也是啊
even though it's only for a few days.


1137
01:11:19.545 --> 01:11:22.673
被黄金蒙蔽了双眼 举手的家伙都死定了
Even if it's only for a few days, they're all blinded by the gold.


1138
01:11:21.213 --> 01:11:23.340
Dammit! I'll kill the
ones who raised their hands!

1139
01:11:24.091 --> 01:11:26.593
-干吗打我？ -你睁眼了吧？
- Why are you hitting me? - You kept your eyes open.


1140
01:11:27.094 --> 01:11:27.928
振作起来
Chin up, yeah?


1141
01:11:29.096 --> 01:11:30.097
浪儿
Rang.


1142
01:11:30.931 --> 01:11:33.267
我反倒觉得如释重负
As far as I'm concerned, I really felt relieved.


1143
01:11:34.059 --> 01:11:35.227
你呢？
How about you?


1144
01:11:38.897 --> 01:11:40.649
不过如今这世道 有钱就是好
Hey. Money is the real boss these days, you know?


1145
01:11:40.733 --> 01:11:43.569
你是输给黄金了 谁赢得了黄金啊
You just lost against gold. How do you win against gold, hmm?


1146
01:11:43.652 --> 01:11:45.154
不要太在意
- Don't mind it too much.


1147
01:11:48.073 --> 01:11:49.700
别得瑟
Tread carefully.


1148
01:11:51.118 --> 01:11:52.286
我不在乎权力
It's not about the position.


1149
01:11:53.370 --> 01:11:55.873
只要够资格 我随时都可以让步
I was willing to give it up if there was anyone worthy.


1150
01:11:56.707 --> 01:11:57.666
什么资格？
Worthy how?


1151
01:11:58.667 --> 01:12:00.502
幕团长 吃饭吧！
Captain Mak-yi, time to eat!


1152
01:12:07.009 --> 01:12:09.053
-我是谁？ -新团长
- Who am I? - The new captain.


1153
01:12:11.597 --> 01:12:12.806
您是新团长
New captain, sir.


1154
01:12:13.515 --> 01:12:15.476
以后不要让我闻到任何腥味
From now on, no fishy food on my plate.


1155
01:12:15.559 --> 01:12:17.186
给我端上一只炖鸡和浊酒
- Bring me a cooked chicken and rice wine.


1156
01:12:17.895 --> 01:12:18.854
喂 团长
Hey, captain?


1157
01:12:19.980 --> 01:12:21.273
半月岛在右边呢
Halfmoon Island is on the right.


1158
01:12:21.357 --> 01:12:22.733
不是说要从它右侧经过吗？
Didn't you say to make a left here?


1159
01:12:22.816 --> 01:12:24.068
这个白痴
You're a moron.


1160
01:12:24.610 --> 01:12:26.236
看到岛就应该立刻回报给我！
Why didn't you tell me when you saw it?


1161
01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:27.488
我刚爬上来
But I just got up here.


1162
01:12:27.571 --> 01:12:29.114
你早干吗了才爬上去？
Why couldn't you get up there sooner?


1163
01:12:29.198 --> 01:12:31.200
因为刚才某人站在这里了
Because someone was standing up here until now,


1164
01:12:31.700 --> 01:12:33.243
沉浸在自己的世界里
acting all cool and showing off.


1165
01:12:33.827 --> 01:12:34.703
今天别给他食物
Don't give him any food.


1166
01:12:35.412 --> 01:12:36.789
给懒人一个鱿鱼都是浪费
Even old squid is wasted on that fool.


1167
01:12:36.872 --> 01:12:38.248
你今天饿一餐试试
No food for you. Eat that!


1168
01:12:40.709 --> 01:12:41.543
把这里擦干净了
- Jerk. - Hey. Wipe here.


1169
01:12:42.586 --> 01:12:43.420
可以了 走开
That's enough. Get lost.


1170
01:12:45.714 --> 01:12:47.216
-你 -怎么了？
- Hey, Witless. - Yeah?


1171
01:12:47.299 --> 01:12:48.175
你也上去
Go up there too.


1172
01:12:48.759 --> 01:12:49.968
一个人就够了啊
Isn't one person enough?


1173
01:12:50.052 --> 01:12:52.012
太阳落山后什么也看不到啊
You can't really see once the sun sets anyway.


1174
01:12:52.096 --> 01:12:54.014
-我们还要吃晚饭 -吃晚饭…
- We need to have dinner, Captain. - I'm hungry.


1175
01:12:54.098 --> 01:12:56.642
可以上去吃啊！
You'll eat your dinner up there with that other moron!


1176
01:12:58.644 --> 01:13:00.521
人怎么会变成那样 要死了
How could he change that much? It's pissing me off.


1177
01:13:00.604 --> 01:13:02.940
-你嘟囔什么？ -什么也没说
- What are you muttering about? - I didn't say anything.


1178
01:13:10.114 --> 01:13:11.490
Yeah!

1179
01:13:12.533 --> 01:13:13.867
这个不得了啊
You are incredible!


1180
01:13:14.493 --> 01:13:17.746
用沙丁鱼怎么能做出这种味道？
Hey. How did you鈥?did you make sardines taste like this?


1181
01:13:18.330 --> 01:13:19.790
并非所有的沙丁鱼都是一样的
Not all sardines are the same.


1182
01:13:20.457 --> 01:13:24.002
若了解这大海的味道 便可以做出这种美味
Ocean flavors, if you know them, you can draw the real flavor like this.


1183
01:13:25.838 --> 01:13:28.132
I knew you had good cooking skills.

1184
01:13:25.921 --> 01:13:28.173
我知道你手艺好
Wow!


1185
01:13:29.133 --> 01:13:30.843
但没想到是这种程度
But I never expected it to be this good. Seriously!


1186
01:13:32.594 --> 01:13:33.679
Mmm!

1187
01:13:35.639 --> 01:13:37.266
这肯定是团长做的
Hey. The Captain should not be cooking!


1188
01:13:38.684 --> 01:13:39.977
团长的制作秘诀是什么？
She's better as a captain than a chef!


1189
01:13:49.194 --> 01:13:50.487
吃完了
I finished it! All of it!


1190
01:13:53.824 --> 01:13:55.993
慢慢吃 以后经常给你做
Take your time eating. I'll make it often from now on.


1191
01:13:57.703 --> 01:13:59.037
Huh?

1192
01:13:59.538 --> 01:14:00.414
Mmm!

1193
01:14:05.961 --> 01:14:09.673
真的很严重 我都没法睡
I'm telling you it's very serious


1194
01:14:08.589 --> 01:14:09.673
I can't sleep.

1195
01:14:12.593 --> 01:14:13.427
过来一下
Come over here.


1196
01:14:14.636 --> 01:14:15.471
看看这个
Take a look at this.


1197
01:14:16.096 --> 01:14:18.015
床腿都断…
The legs of the bed are all bro鈥?ken.


1198
01:14:20.225 --> 01:14:21.810
修好了
All fixed now.


1199
01:14:21.894 --> 01:14:23.061
告辞
Good. Excuse me.


1200
01:14:27.107 --> 01:14:28.525
你为什么修这个？
- Why would you fix the bed, Rang? - Why not me?


1201
01:14:28.609 --> 01:14:30.027
为什么这么问？

1202
01:14:30.611 --> 01:14:33.071
你知道弄断这些有多难吗？
Do you have any idea how hard it was to break all of those?


1203
01:14:33.947 --> 01:14:34.781
Huh?

1204
01:14:35.449 --> 01:14:37.326
我真是活不下去了 为什么修啊
Seriously鈥?I mean, why did you鈥?


1205
01:14:39.453 --> 01:14:40.287
抱歉
I'm sorry.


1206
01:14:41.872 --> 01:14:42.706
算了
It's okay.


1207
01:14:42.789 --> 01:14:45.584
不过借给我那个吧 红色的
Could you help me out and let me borrow that red stuff?


1208
01:14:46.251 --> 01:14:47.961
你涂嘴唇的那个东西
The thing you put on your lips.


1209
01:14:52.257 --> 01:14:53.467
我怎么会有那种东西
I have no such thing.


1210
01:14:53.967 --> 01:14:54.885
You know. Come on.

1211
01:14:55.469 --> 01:14:58.305
你和武治哥在厨房干活的时候 经常涂的那个…
When you're around Mu-chi in the kitchen, and you put it on to--


1212
01:15:02.476 --> 01:15:03.977
浪儿在吗？
Rang, are you there?


1213
01:15:12.069 --> 01:15:14.071
-叫我出来是想让我看这个吗？ -怎么样？
Did you ask me here to see this?


1214
01:15:13.487 --> 01:15:14.321
You like it?

1215
01:15:18.200 --> 01:15:19.034
是啊
I forgot


1216
01:15:20.577 --> 01:15:22.246
夜空总是如此美丽
the night sky was always so beautiful.


1217
01:15:39.638 --> 01:15:41.014
不过你往头发上抹什么了？
What did you put in your hair?


1218
01:15:41.848 --> 01:15:42.683
抹什么？
My hair?


1219
01:15:44.101 --> 01:15:45.394
因为没洗头 所以出油了
Uh, it's oily from not washing it.


1220
01:15:46.061 --> 01:15:49.481
用了我麻油的小子是谁！
Who the hell was it?


1221
01:15:47.854 --> 01:15:49.898
Who touched my sesame oil?

1222
01:15:52.234 --> 01:15:53.110
有人找你
They're looking for you.


1223
01:15:56.989 --> 01:15:58.156
浪儿
Rang,


1224
01:15:58.907 --> 01:15:59.783
你懂爱情吗？
what do you know of love?


1225
01:16:00.576 --> 01:16:01.868
那是我的私事
That's personal.


1226
01:16:01.952 --> 01:16:03.453
Huh?

1227
01:16:04.162 --> 01:16:04.997
是私事呢
What are you talking about, personal?


1228
01:16:07.124 --> 01:16:09.501
每个人的爱都不一样
Love means something different for everyone.


1229
01:16:10.752 --> 01:16:12.004
就像海浪的大小不同
Just like waves of different sizes.


1230
01:16:13.505 --> 01:16:15.465
那么去妓院和妓女分享的爱
Then is love you give to courtesans a big wave or a small wave?


1231
01:16:15.549 --> 01:16:16.842
是巨浪还是小浪？

1232
01:16:19.428 --> 01:16:20.929
-我就喝了点酒 -算了
- I only drank there. - Yeah. Sure.


1233
01:16:22.931 --> 01:16:24.766
我真的只喝酒了
I only drank. I swear.


1234
01:16:25.642 --> 01:16:27.102
副团长姜燮…
Your quartermaster, Kang-seop鈥?


1235
01:16:27.185 --> 01:16:29.271
我问你了吗？
I don't recall asking about that.


1236
01:16:31.064 --> 01:16:32.566
我真的只喝酒了
Really, I only drank.


1237
01:16:32.649 --> 01:16:34.109
-是姜燮… -我先下去了
- Kang-seop-- - I'm going back down.


1238
01:16:34.192 --> 01:16:35.027
浪儿
Rang.


1239
01:16:36.028 --> 01:16:37.195
浪儿 等等 你看看这个
Rang, wait. Take a look at this.


1240
01:16:38.363 --> 01:16:39.197
浪儿
Rang.


1241
01:16:40.324 --> 01:16:43.785
“意图深邃胜海渊 勇气隐匿于黑暗”
"Meaning is as deep as the sea, but courage is hidden in the dark.


1242
01:16:44.286 --> 01:16:47.539
“穿越刹那之流光 追寻真理的光芒”
Pass by the flash of light and find the light of the truth."


1243
01:16:49.708 --> 01:16:50.876
这是什么意思 大哥？
What does it mean, captain?


1244
01:16:51.918 --> 01:16:55.547
解开这个谜底才能找到宝物
We have to solve this riddle in order to find the treasure.


1245
01:16:56.340 --> 01:16:59.468
惩治逆贼的时候才会进行枭首
Impaling the head on a spike is a punishment usually reserved for traitors.


1246
01:16:59.551 --> 01:17:01.928
这十二个人会是谁呢 大哥？
Do you know who these 12 men are, captain?


1247
01:17:10.312 --> 01:17:11.730
海水沸腾了！
The sea is boiling!


1248
01:17:12.814 --> 01:17:14.358
什么？海水沸腾了？
What? The sea is boiling?


1249
01:17:17.444 --> 01:17:18.403
那是什么？
What's that?


1250
01:17:18.487 --> 01:17:19.738
乌云马上要来了
Dark clouds will roll in soon.


1251
01:17:20.739 --> 01:17:21.907
-赶紧把船帆折起来 -是
We must fold the sails, now.


1252
01:17:22.824 --> 01:17:24.785
-快把船帆折起来 -折起船帆
Fold the sails! Fold the sails!


1253
01:17:24.868 --> 01:17:26.078
时机还没到！
Not yet!


1254
01:17:27.079 --> 01:17:28.288
时机未到 先别动
- Don't do it yet. - Not until I say so.


1255
01:17:29.498 --> 01:17:31.124
搞不好会流入火海之中…
If we mistime it, we'll be swept into the Sea of Fire!


1256
01:17:33.794 --> 01:17:35.504
向您汇报 团长
Trust me, Captain.


1257
01:17:36.004 --> 01:17:36.838
我说
Do tell.


1258
01:17:38.507 --> 01:17:41.510
前团长不知道闪电岛 怎么会知道火海呢？
How does the former captain not know Bongaesum,


1259
01:17:41.593 --> 01:17:44.513
小时候被暴风雨卷进去过
but knows the Sea of Fire?


1260
01:17:42.177 --> 01:17:44.763
I was swept into it by
a rainstorm when I was young.

1261
01:17:45.389 --> 01:17:49.142
这升腾的水汽和当年一样
And this rising haze looks just like it did then.


1262
01:17:51.311 --> 01:17:53.355
穿过闪电岛之后才会出现火海
The Sea of Fire appears after passing Bongaesum.


1263
01:17:54.398 --> 01:17:55.732
但即使是鬼也会死在那里
Even a ghost would die there,


1264
01:17:57.484 --> 01:17:58.318
你活着出来了？
but you survived?


1265
01:17:58.402 --> 01:18:00.404
我活着出来才会在这里啊
I wouldn't be standing here if I hadn't.


1266
01:18:00.487 --> 01:18:03.407
据说火海中有成百上千的龙
I've heard that hundreds of thousands of dragons live in the Sea of Fire, so鈥?


1267
01:18:05.784 --> 01:18:06.618
你看到龙了吗？
You've seen a dragon?


1268
01:18:06.702 --> 01:18:09.996
实际上那不是龙 而是火柱
When you see it for real,


1269
01:18:08.036 --> 01:18:10.414
it's not dragons, but huge pillars of fire.

1270
01:18:10.872 --> 01:18:14.334
成百上千的火柱破海冲天
Hundreds and thousands of pillars of fire piercing the sea


1271
01:18:14.626 --> 01:18:16.378
and surging into the sky!

1272
01:18:16.628 --> 01:18:18.505
乌云要靠近了！
The black clouds are rolling in!


1273
01:18:27.431 --> 01:18:28.473
必须马上折起船帆
We must hurry and fold the sails.


1274
01:18:29.266 --> 01:18:30.976
失去船帆 就会失去一切
If we lose the sails, we lose everything!


1275
01:18:31.059 --> 01:18:32.269
时机未到！
I just said not yet!


1276
01:18:34.563 --> 01:18:35.397
这个路我熟
I know the way.


1277
01:18:36.481 --> 01:18:37.733
Huh?

1278
01:18:38.817 --> 01:18:39.985
躲开！
Everyone out of the way!


1279
01:18:40.902 --> 01:18:41.903
是闪电！
Lightning!


1280
01:18:49.202 --> 01:18:51.204
快把帆折起来 把船舶下角合上！
Quickly fold the sails and batten down the hatches!


1281
01:18:52.497 --> 01:18:53.749
折起船帆！
Fold the sails!


1282
01:19:01.673 --> 01:19:03.467
躲开！
Get out!


1283
01:19:07.804 --> 01:19:10.640
别抬头 我们都会死的！
Keep your heads down! We're all gonna die!


1284
01:19:13.477 --> 01:19:14.311
团长
Captain!


1285
01:19:19.274 --> 01:19:22.277
幕团长 赶紧握舵轮啊 只有你知道路！
Captain Mak-yi, take the wheel! You know the way!


1286
01:19:22.360 --> 01:19:23.403
幕团长！
Captain Mak-yi! The wheel is spinning by itself!


1287
01:19:23.487 --> 01:19:25.822
舵轮自己转呢！

1288
01:19:33.413 --> 01:19:34.247
快上去！
Captain Mak-yi, go quickly!


1289
01:19:34.748 --> 01:19:35.957
幕团长 快点上去啊！

1290
01:19:51.973 --> 01:19:54.893
在这里都会死的 都躲到甲板下面！
We'll all die up here!


1291
01:19:53.350 --> 01:19:54.309
Get below deck!

1292
01:19:54.893 --> 01:19:56.394
Go down! Go down!

1293
01:19:56.478 --> 01:19:59.648
水满就死定了 不能下去！
If the boat fills with water, you'll all die!


1294
01:19:58.605 --> 01:19:59.648
Don't go below deck!

1295
01:20:00.816 --> 01:20:01.858
上去！
Get back up! Get back up!


1296
01:20:04.986 --> 01:20:06.738
用绳子把自己绑起来！
Tie yourself with rope.


1297
01:20:07.364 --> 01:20:09.616
幕团长 赶紧指挥啊！
Captain Mak-yi, give the order!


1298
01:20:09.699 --> 01:20:10.909
就那么做吧！
Do that! Do that!


1299
01:20:10.992 --> 01:20:14.287
船舶破损就逃不掉了 不要绑起来 要抓住！
If the ship wrecks, you won't be able to escape!


1300
01:20:13.328 --> 01:20:15.413
Don't tie yourself! Just hold on!

1301
01:20:15.080 --> 01:20:15.914
抓住！
Hold on!


1302
01:20:16.665 --> 01:20:18.166
全员听从浪儿的话！
Everyone, follow Rang's orders!


1303
01:20:19.209 --> 01:20:23.463
只要你闭嘴就行了 禹武治！
If you just keep your mouth shut it'd be fine Wu Mu-chi!


1304
01:20:30.345 --> 01:20:31.513
原来是这样的啊 大哥！
That's what they're for, captain?


1305
01:20:33.765 --> 01:20:34.683
不愧是大哥！
As expected of our captain!


1306
01:21:01.209 --> 01:21:02.335
抓紧了！
Hold on tight!


1307
01:21:08.216 --> 01:21:09.426
救救我！
Help me!


1308
01:21:14.931 --> 01:21:17.309
快把帆折起来 把船舶下角合上！
Quickly fold the sails and batten down the hatches!


1309
01:21:19.227 --> 01:21:20.520
动作快点！
Quickly! Go!


1310
01:21:24.733 --> 01:21:28.278
这哪是十年的量？是一万年！
This isn't ten years' worth of lightning! It's like 10,000 years'!


1311
01:21:53.970 --> 01:21:55.972
别怂了 握住我的脖子！
Pull yourself together! Grab my neck.


1312
01:21:59.309 --> 01:22:00.143
不是那里
Not like that.


1313
01:22:05.899 --> 01:22:07.359
救命！
- Help! - Save us!


1314
01:22:08.026 --> 01:22:09.194
Ah, shit!

1315
01:22:41.726 --> 01:22:42.852
What?

1316
01:22:43.228 --> 01:22:45.105
这是天堂 还是地狱啊
This is it! We're finally here!


1317
01:22:47.148 --> 01:22:49.859
救命 这里有人！
Save us! We're over here!


1318
01:22:49.943 --> 01:22:51.069
救命！
Save us!


1319
01:22:51.152 --> 01:22:54.864
看到闪电要避远 第一次见闪电吗？
After the first lightning strike, you get out of the way?


1320
01:22:54.948 --> 01:22:56.866
明明是自己躲得最快
Your first storm, huh?


1321
01:22:56.950 --> 01:22:58.368
-快下去 -一群傻瓜
He was the first to run away, dammit!


1322
01:22:57.534 --> 01:22:59.369
- Get off! 
- You're all idiots!

1323
01:23:10.505 --> 01:23:13.133
幕团长 宝物在哪里？
Captain Mak-yi, where's the treasure?


1324
01:23:13.758 --> 01:23:15.301
现在开始找啊 都没有地图了
We have to find it. We don't have the map.


1325
01:23:15.385 --> 01:23:16.594
什么？
What?


1326
01:23:17.095 --> 01:23:20.056
真是的 鼠粪般大的岛 随便挖也能挖出来吧
It's a small island. If we dig around, we'll stumble across it.


1327
01:23:20.932 --> 01:23:22.434
鼠粪？鼠粪有这么大吗？
Small? You call this small?


1328
01:23:26.688 --> 01:23:27.897
找死啊
I ought to kill this fool.


1329
01:23:27.981 --> 01:23:30.316
怎么都盯着我？行动啊
What? Why are you all staring at me, huh?


1330
01:23:30.400 --> 01:23:31.818
因为你是头儿啊
You're the leader.


1331
01:23:32.819 --> 01:23:34.571
给我什么待遇了？
When did you treat me like one?


1332
01:23:34.654 --> 01:23:36.865
有人乖乖听我的话吗？
Not one of you ever followed my orders, dammit!


1333
01:23:37.782 --> 01:23:38.867
都在背后骂我
You all talk behind my back,


1334
01:23:39.367 --> 01:23:41.411
又苦又危险的事情都让我出面
then put me on the spot when things got dangerous?


1335
01:23:41.494 --> 01:23:42.912
这是奴隶好不好！
It's like being a damn slave!


1336
01:23:42.996 --> 01:23:44.706
那才是头儿 你不知道吗？
That's what being a leader is. You didn't know?


1337
01:23:45.331 --> 01:23:46.666
-是的 -没错
He's right.


1338
01:23:46.750 --> 01:23:47.584
要疯了
That's insane.


1339
01:23:48.168 --> 01:23:49.794
好 你们等着
Right. Just a moment.


1340
01:24:02.432 --> 01:24:03.808
-想起来了 -怎么了？
- He remembers. - What is it?


1341
01:24:04.642 --> 01:24:05.477
我不想当头儿了
I quit being the leader.


1342
01:24:05.560 --> 01:24:07.479
真想砍掉你的头
- I'll crush his head! I'm serious!


1343
01:24:11.483 --> 01:24:13.485
是闪电岛！
Bongaesum ahoy!


1344
01:24:13.985 --> 01:24:14.903
Where?

1345
01:24:22.243 --> 01:24:23.912
-走 -正在走
Let go of me! Let go! I'm walking!


1346
01:24:26.039 --> 01:24:28.416
头目 这是陆地 不是大海
Boss, this is the land, not the ocean.


1347
01:24:29.709 --> 01:24:32.087
海中有龙 陆上有虎
The dragon is master at sea, but the tiger is on land.


1348
01:24:34.422 --> 01:24:35.882
从今以后 我海盗王小幕
So, now I, Mak-yi, the Pirate King鈥?


1349
01:24:40.637 --> 01:24:41.763
小幕会服从您的命令
鈥ill follow your orders.


1350
01:24:45.141 --> 01:24:47.769
幕团长 我离开陆地 跟随大海很久了
I've been away at sea too long, Captain.


1351
01:24:48.895 --> 01:24:50.939
副团长 你知道路线吗？
Quartermaster, you dare to lead the way


1352
01:24:51.022 --> 01:24:53.024
知道路线的幕团长在后面呢
when Captain Mak-yi, who knows the way, is behind you?


1353
01:24:53.108 --> 01:24:54.484
还不快跑过来 幕团长？
Come here, Captain Mak-yi, in three, two鈥?


1354
01:24:54.567 --> 01:24:56.236
一 二

1355
01:24:59.239 --> 01:25:00.073
这边
It's over there.


1356
01:25:07.747 --> 01:25:08.873
你在找什么？
Looking for something?


1357
01:25:09.874 --> 01:25:11.000
河流
A stream of water.


1358
01:25:12.877 --> 01:25:14.754
不愧是团长啊
You sure are a natural leader.


1359
01:25:16.548 --> 01:25:17.882
朱芳应该也会这么做
Joo Bang would have done the same.


1360
01:25:21.803 --> 01:25:22.637
快点！
Hurry!


1361
01:25:26.474 --> 01:25:28.601
这些人一直住在这里
These folks sure rest peacefully here.


1362
01:25:29.686 --> 01:25:31.688
难怪没有人见过消失的朱芳
This is why no one's seen Joo Bang since he disappeared.


1363
01:25:37.735 --> 01:25:39.487
话说 大哥解开了那个谜底吗？
By the way, did you solve the riddle, Captain?


1364
01:25:41.239 --> 01:25:45.243
“意图深邃胜海渊 勇气隐匿于黑暗”
"Meaning is as deep as the sea, courage is hidden in the dark.


1365
01:25:45.326 --> 01:25:46.703
“穿越刹那之流光”
Pass by the flash of light and find the light of the truth."


1366
01:25:48.246 --> 01:25:49.831
“追寻真理的光芒”

1367
01:25:55.378 --> 01:25:56.379
还要挖吗？
There's nothing here.


1368
01:25:56.462 --> 01:25:58.715
有疑虑就别挖了
If you're not gonna trust me, stop digging!


1369
01:25:58.798 --> 01:26:00.884
闪电只击相同的地方
The lightning is striking the same place.


1370
01:26:01.634 --> 01:26:02.635
现在
Now!


1371
01:26:03.469 --> 01:26:04.304
是吧？
- Hmm. - See?


1372
01:26:04.888 --> 01:26:06.514
击打相同的地方
It strikes the same place over and over.


1373
01:26:06.598 --> 01:26:09.225
怀疑的时候又击打
Just when you think it's done, it--


1374
01:26:09.309 --> 01:26:10.143
就是现在
There! Right now.


1375
01:26:10.852 --> 01:26:12.061
Whoa.

1376
01:26:12.896 --> 01:26:13.730
难道有东西？
Is there something there?


1377
01:26:14.772 --> 01:26:16.691
-看样子是有 -会是什么呢？
- It seems like it. - But what?


1378
01:26:17.942 --> 01:26:19.319
-去看看？ -去瞧瞧？
- Shall we see? - Shall we?


1379
01:26:20.320 --> 01:26:22.197
不要挖那边 要挖这个地方
- Don't dig there. Dig right here.


1380
01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:23.114
还要挖吗？
Should we dig more?


1381
01:26:25.158 --> 01:26:26.367
-再挖点 -再？
- Dig more. - More?


1382
01:26:27.035 --> 01:26:28.036
就一点点
Just a little bit more.


1383
01:26:29.996 --> 01:26:31.706
挖得很深嘛
Ugh. Dammit.


1384
01:26:29.996 --> 01:26:32.165
Wow. Look at all you've dug!

1385
01:26:32.457 --> 01:26:34.500
一群白痴 让你们挖 还挖那么深
These morons just keep digging because I told them to?


1386
01:26:35.919 --> 01:26:36.753
还要挖吗？

1387
01:26:38.338 --> 01:26:39.464
找到了
Something's here!


1388
01:26:39.547 --> 01:26:41.966
-找到了 -在哪儿？
- He found something.


1389
01:26:42.050 --> 01:26:43.927
等那个小子来了就埋里面
Let's bury him here when he comes over.


1390
01:26:44.594 --> 01:26:45.428
活埋吗？
- Alive? - Hey.


1391
01:26:46.971 --> 01:26:48.181
找到了吗？
You鈥?you've found something?


1392
01:26:48.723 --> 01:26:49.641
抓住那个小子！
- Treasure. - Get that son of a bitch!


1393
01:26:50.850 --> 01:26:52.894
-臭小子 别跑 -抓住那个小子！
Get that bastard, dammit!


1394
01:26:56.272 --> 01:26:57.106
我自己过去吧
I'll go on my own.


1395
01:26:58.191 --> 01:26:59.817
黄金是个好东西啊
Gold is truly amazing.


1396
01:27:01.194 --> 01:27:02.028
什么？
Hmm?


1397
01:27:02.946 --> 01:27:05.448
第一次看你主动出面
I've never seen you doing something without someone ordering you to.


1398
01:27:09.035 --> 01:27:09.869
因为你想要嘛
It's because you want it.


1399
01:27:10.370 --> 01:27:12.830
要不是因为你 我都不会来这里
If it weren't for you, I wouldn't be here.


1400
01:27:13.623 --> 01:27:15.333
我也不会留在那该死的海上
Or stayed on that damned sea at all.


1401
01:27:23.049 --> 01:27:23.967
第一次见到你时
The first time I saw you,


1402
01:27:25.134 --> 01:27:27.095
我以为是阴间使者来接我的
I thought you were the angel of death coming for my soul.


1403
01:27:32.267 --> 01:27:33.101
我很心动
My heart fluttered


1404

与你同行的阴间路

即使死了也很开心

1406

-这不是人间美味嘛 -嗯

1409
01:28:13.725 --> 01:28:14.642
Hmm.

01:28:20.231 --> 01:28:21.482
不客气
Don't mention it.


1413
01:29:30.343 --> 01:29:31.177
叛徒

1414
01:29:48.236 --> 01:29:49.362
找对地方了

那边是左侍中曹敏修大人
And that's Left State Counselor Cho Min-su.


1418
01:30:00.540 --> 01:30:02.667
朝鲜的开国功臣们
All the founders of Joseon are all gathered here.


1419
01:30:03.251 --> 01:30:04.419
原来都聚在这里
Those were the twelve traitors of Goryeo.


1420

是高丽沦陷的十二逆贼

1421
01:30:08.172 --> 01:30:10.049
先拔出供奉主上殿下的铁枪
Pull out the spear of the one that served his majesty and dig underneath it.


1422
01:30:10.716 --> 01:30:11.926

逃跑就死定了！
If you run, you're dead!


1434
01:30:40.788 --> 01:30:41.622
快点！

1435
01:30:45.793 --> 01:30:48.087
-机关？ -有机关 都退后
- A trap? - It's a trap! Get back!


1436
01:30:48.880 --> 01:30:49.714
退后！

1437
01:31:00.516 --> 01:31:01.350
崔莹

1449
01:31:57.198 --> 01:31:58.032
你是什么？
What are you?


1450
01:32:00.034 --> 01:32:01.035
是鸟 还是鱼？
A bird or a fish?


1451
01:32:02.995 --> 01:32:03.996
What?

1452
01:32:06.290 --> 01:32:07.500
黄金

1454
01:32:11.963 --> 01:32:15.925
小幕这个混蛋 被我抓到就撕烂你
Mak-yi, you ass! I can't believe you.


1455
01:32:14.257 --> 01:32:16.425
If I find you,

1462

你不是找到了吗？

1463
01:32:29.146 --> 01:32:30.106
在哪里？

1464
01:32:30.773 --> 01:32:31.857
我问你在哪里！
Where is it?


1465
01:32:34.318 --> 01:32:35.152
这个混蛋
That little鈥?


1466
01:32:37.029 --> 01:32:38.698
你敢不敢再出来！
You better get back here!


1467

1468

小团长

那个东西吧

是长得像人类的鸟
a bird that looks like a man.


1471
01:32:47.957 --> 01:32:49.959
还是长得像鱼一样的人 反正
Or a man that looks like a bird-fish thing.


1472
01:32:50.042 --> 01:32:52.211
有一个奇怪的家伙咬着这么大的黄金
This creature had a huge piece of gold in it's mouth.


1473
01:32:53.754 --> 01:32:56.007
明明在这里 这样挥舞来着
He was right here, like this.


1474
01:32:58.259 --> 01:32:59.635
妈的
I call bullshit!


1475
01:33:00.845 --> 01:33:01.679
我受够了
The last straw.


1476
01:33:02.388 --> 01:33:04.015
-杀了他 -再也忍不下去了
- Kill him! - I'm tired of this!


1477
01:33:06.684 --> 01:33:08.603
砍掉你这该死的嘴！
That lying mouth!


1478
01:33:12.231 --> 01:33:14.233
-看那个 -那是什么？
- What is that? - What is that?


1479
01:33:18.321 --> 01:33:19.155
黄金

1480
01:33:20.531 --> 01:33:21.365
看到了吗？
Did you see?


1481
01:33:23.367 --> 01:33:24.535
看到了吗？
Did you see?


1482
01:33:25.411 --> 01:33:26.412
相信吗？
Do you believe me?


1483
01:33:27.872 --> 01:33:29.665
相信吗！
Do you believe me?


1484
01:33:30.207 --> 01:33:31.834
相信！

1485
01:33:34.503 --> 01:33:35.671
那快去找吧
Then hurry up and find it.


1486
01:33:35.755 --> 01:33:37.548
黄金在等着我们
The gold is waiting here for us!


1487
01:33:37.632 --> 01:33:39.592
到嘴边了都吃不了的话
If you can't take it from here, you're not worthy to be a pirate!


1488
01:33:40.593 --> 01:33:42.845
就没有资格当海盗！

1489
01:33:42.928 --> 01:33:45.556
甚至不配当水母！
Let alone a jellyfish!


1490
01:33:45.640 --> 01:33:47.641
Yeah!

1491
01:33:48.434 --> 01:33:50.436
-开始找！ -开始找！
- Find it! - Find it!


1492
01:34:00.571 --> 01:34:01.864
你从哪儿找来的？
Where did you get it?


1493
01:34:02.865 --> 01:34:04.241
快说啊
Say something already!


1494
01:34:04.825 --> 01:34:06.410
你是在问鸟吗？
Are you asking the bird?


1495
01:34:06.494 --> 01:34:07.411
鸟？
Bird?


1496
01:34:08.454 --> 01:34:09.413
还不明白吗？
You still don't get it?


1497
01:34:10.581 --> 01:34:12.124
给我用一下 你们看啊
Here. Give me that. Watch this.


1498
01:34:17.171 --> 01:34:19.757
看到了吧？世界上
You saw that, right? You saw that?


1499
01:34:19.840 --> 01:34:21.467
哪有贪图黄金的野兽？
When have we ever seen an animal that wants gold?


1500
01:34:21.550 --> 01:34:23.761
见过吗？
Have you? Have you?


1501
01:34:23.844 --> 01:34:26.514
我是没见过 不知道别人怎么样
- No. - I haven't neither.


1502
01:34:26.597 --> 01:34:28.974
but you can't fool a former merchant.

1503
01:34:26.597 --> 01:34:29.100
但你骗不了前商人的眼睛的
You might fool the others,


1504
01:34:29.600 --> 01:34:30.726
所以你的意思是
Are you saying that is actually a person?


1505
01:34:30.810 --> 01:34:33.187
它是人吗？

1506
01:34:34.105 --> 01:34:35.773
郁闷死了 真是的
Ugh. This is so damn frustrating!


1507
01:34:36.774 --> 01:34:39.235
来 好言相劝的时候赶紧说
Come on. Say something while we're still being nice.


1508
01:34:39.318 --> 01:34:40.611
你从哪弄来的黄金？
Where did you get that gold, huh?


1509
01:34:41.153 --> 01:34:42.321
你看我一副好人脸吗？
I'm being nice.


1510
01:34:45.074 --> 01:34:46.742
非要看到血才能听到吗？
Do you have to bleed to start flapping that beak?


1511
01:34:48.452 --> 01:34:50.204
生平第一次见这么傻的人
I've never seen someone as stupid as you are.


1512
01:34:55.251 --> 01:34:56.335
对不起啊 鸟哥
Forgive him, birdie.


1513
01:34:57.044 --> 01:34:58.587
我 幕团长
I, Captain Mak-yi,


1514
01:34:58.671 --> 01:35:00.339
替我的手下向你道歉
apologize for this rotten bastard crewmember.


1515
01:35:03.008 --> 01:35:04.593
话说 你的首领在哪儿？
Could you tell us where your leader is?


1516
01:35:08.723 --> 01:35:09.557
什么？
- What is that?


1517
01:35:14.061 --> 01:35:14.937
大炮？
It's a cannon.


1518
01:35:17.356 --> 01:35:19.233
团长 那边有官船
Captain, the government ship.


1519
01:35:20.443 --> 01:35:21.777
开炮！
The ship's here.


1520
01:35:20.443 --> 01:35:21.777
Fire!

1521
01:35:29.326 --> 01:35:31.328
找到了！
Huh?


1522
01:35:29.326 --> 01:35:31.746
We found it! We found it!

1523
01:35:31.829 --> 01:35:34.206
快拉上来！
- Pull it up. Hurry!


1524
01:35:35.207 --> 01:35:36.500
真有啊
It actually exists.


1525
01:35:37.877 --> 01:35:38.878
拉上来！
Pull it up! Yeah!


1526
01:35:43.132 --> 01:35:44.425
什么动静？

1527
01:35:46.302 --> 01:35:47.261
这个鼠崽子
The little rat.


1528
01:36:00.858 --> 01:36:01.817
禹武治
Wu Mu-chi.


1529
01:36:11.911 --> 01:36:13.078
辛苦你了啊
You've done a good job finding a treasure that belongs to someone else.


1530
01:36:13.162 --> 01:36:14.747
寻找有主人的宝物

1531
01:36:15.372 --> 01:36:16.624
谁是主人？
And who is that?


1532
01:36:16.707 --> 01:36:17.541
我
Me.


1533
01:36:23.714 --> 01:36:25.800
我们砍下那个疯子的头吧
Leave it to us to cut off that crazy bastard's head!


1534
01:36:29.845 --> 01:36:30.846
拉上来！

1535
01:36:32.890 --> 01:36:35.226
不要停 开炮！
Don't stop now! Fire!


1536
01:36:45.152 --> 01:36:46.111
团长
What do we do?


1537
01:36:46.737 --> 01:36:47.571
怎么办？
Captain?


1538
01:37:01.168 --> 01:37:02.002
听着
Listen up.


1539
01:37:04.171 --> 01:37:05.756
不管今天是否与我战斗而死
Whether you die fighting with me today,


1540
01:37:05.840 --> 01:37:08.259
还是回首今天在后悔中度过
or turn your back and live in regret for abandoning us,


1541
01:37:08.843 --> 01:37:10.761
你们可以自己决定在哪里死
the choice of where you die is yours to make.


1542
01:37:11.262 --> 01:37:13.097
但作为团长 我可以保证
But I promise you as a captain,


1543
01:37:13.597 --> 01:37:16.350
我决不会死在这个岛上
I have no intention of dying on this island.


1544
01:37:16.433 --> 01:37:18.310
也不会让你们任何人
And I won't let any of you die


1545
01:37:20.062 --> 01:37:22.147
死在这个岛上
on this god-forsaken island either.


1546
01:37:22.648 --> 01:37:24.942
我要和团长一起去！
Captain, I will stay with you!


1547
01:37:25.025 --> 01:37:26.485
-我也是 -我也是
Me too! Me too!


1548
01:37:26.569 --> 01:37:27.611
团长
Captain, we must stay together from now on.


1549
01:37:28.195 --> 01:37:29.530
我们必须永远在一起
You live life only once.


1550
01:37:29.613 --> 01:37:31.448
人只活一次

1551
01:37:32.157 --> 01:37:34.451
大手大脚地花钱后再死吧
Let's have our way with gold and welcome our fate!


1552
01:37:34.535 --> 01:37:35.828
没错！
Yeah!


1553
01:37:36.662 --> 01:37:39.874
-抢夺官船！ -找到宝物！
Let's take down the government ship!


1554
01:37:38.330 --> 01:37:39.873
And find the treasure too!

1555
01:37:43.794 --> 01:37:46.797
好 从现在开始抢夺官船
Okay! Let's take the government ship now!


1556
01:37:48.215 --> 01:37:49.466
副团长去救头目
Quartermaster, go rescue your boss.


1557
01:37:49.550 --> 01:37:51.594
直到掠夺官船之前引诱敌军
Draw the enemy's attention until we take the ship.


1558
01:37:53.637 --> 01:37:55.514
过去的义贼们擅长爬山
As former bandits, we're good on land.


1559
01:37:57.057 --> 01:38:00.227
久违地和头目一起畅快玩一把吧
Let's climb that mountain, find our boss, and have a long overdue reunion!


1560
01:38:00.728 --> 01:38:01.645
玩一把！
- Let's go have some fun! - Let's go!


1561
01:38:01.729 --> 01:38:02.771
我们走！
Let's go! Let's go!


1562
01:38:02.855 --> 01:38:04.064
我们走！

1563
01:38:05.691 --> 01:38:08.402
-我们走！ -我们走！
- Let's go! - Let's go!


1564
01:38:09.278 --> 01:38:10.779
让开 别挡路
Out of the way, man. You're blocking us.


1565
01:38:11.280 --> 01:38:12.448
Let's go!

1566
01:38:12.781 --> 01:38:13.616
走！
Forward!


1567
01:38:16.827 --> 01:38:17.703
我才是团长
I thought I was captain.


1568
01:38:19.788 --> 01:38:20.623
我们也去吧
Let's go too.


1569
01:38:23.125 --> 01:38:24.126
寻找黄金
To find the damn gold!


1570
01:38:41.685 --> 01:38:42.519
海琴！
Hae-geum!


1571
01:39:01.705 --> 01:39:04.625
（入）

1572
01:39:07.711 --> 01:39:08.921
这是什么？
- Where's the treasure? - All that's here are rocks!


1573
01:39:09.004 --> 01:39:11.298
-宝物在哪里？ -全都是石头

1574
01:39:12.424 --> 01:39:13.425
去找找！
- Find it! - Captain!


1575
01:39:17.262 --> 01:39:18.764
-让开 -抓住他！
Catch him!


1576
01:39:18.847 --> 01:39:21.183
让开！

1577
01:39:24.478 --> 01:39:25.813
抓住他！
Get him!


1578
01:39:25.896 --> 01:39:28.107
抓住他！

1579
01:39:28.190 --> 01:39:30.526
入？还要进哪儿啊？
"Entrance"? There's another entrance?


1580
01:39:32.152 --> 01:39:32.987
你去哪儿？
Where are you going?


1581
01:39:33.779 --> 01:39:34.613
Huh?

1582
01:39:36.073 --> 01:39:38.534
你在那儿做什么？ 直接过来吧 赶紧的！
What are you doing? Let's get going!


1583
01:39:37.950 --> 01:39:39.201
Just come here!

1584
01:39:40.577 --> 01:39:41.912
直接过来啊
Let's go!


1585
01:39:45.791 --> 01:39:47.418
太没有默契了
Our teamwork is terrible, seriously!


1586
01:39:53.841 --> 01:39:57.219
夫兴秀！
Bu Heung-su!


1587
01:40:05.769 --> 01:40:07.062
你需要这个鬼怪面具吗？
Do you need this goblin mask?


1588
01:40:08.731 --> 01:40:11.233
这好像是寻宝物的最后一把钥匙
Seems like it's the final key to find the treasure.


1589
01:40:14.278 --> 01:40:16.238
如果你乖乖交出 我就放了你一命
If you hand it over now, I'll spare your life.


1590
01:40:18.073 --> 01:40:19.992
反正你也没有船载宝物
You probably don't even have a ship to carry the treasure, anyway.


1591
01:40:21.785 --> 01:40:22.619
船？
Ship?


1592
01:40:23.454 --> 01:40:24.788
一艘船就够了
But I only need one ship.


1593
01:40:24.872 --> 01:40:28.083
如果你不是懦夫 不如赌上宝物
If you're not a coward,


1594
01:40:27.249 --> 01:40:28.375
me against you.

1595
01:40:29.918 --> 01:40:31.003
来一场首领对决吧？
Let's duel for the treasure.


1596
01:40:31.086 --> 01:40:32.796
你别逃跑就行
Just don't run away.


1597
01:40:44.933 --> 01:40:46.101
-咦？ -咦？
- Huh? - Oh.


1598
01:41:06.580 --> 01:41:08.207
别动 这是首领对决！
Stop! This is a leader's duel.


1599
01:41:13.170 --> 01:41:15.214
咱快点吧
Can we go a little faster, please?


1600
01:41:21.512 --> 01:41:22.346
龙
Dragons.


1601
01:41:23.055 --> 01:41:24.098
龙要升天了
The dragons are awakening!


1602
01:41:30.312 --> 01:41:32.022
你还耍小聪明！
- You've been tricking me all along!


1603
01:41:32.106 --> 01:41:32.940
臭小子
You bastard!


1604
01:41:34.149 --> 01:41:35.567
要是被我抓到了
You'd better run, you turd!


1605
01:41:35.651 --> 01:41:37.444
我就撕断你的腿！
I'll rip your legs off if I catch you!


1606
01:41:45.661 --> 01:41:46.829
小子…
Got you!


1607
01:42:13.522 --> 01:42:14.523
Get him!

1608
01:42:15.482 --> 01:42:17.401
专心打架！
Why have you been trying to pick that up? Just focus on fighting!


1609
01:42:30.455 --> 01:42:31.290
什么东西？
What?


1610
01:42:37.045 --> 01:42:38.005
What's this?

1611
01:42:48.557 --> 01:42:49.391
一模一样
Huh? It's the same.


1612
01:42:55.314 --> 01:42:56.523
忍一忍 把脚抬起来！

1613
01:42:57.858 --> 01:42:59.443
我没有脸见您 团长
I have no excuses, Captain.


1614
01:43:00.152 --> 01:43:01.153
我们活下来了
We're alive? We're alive?


1615
01:43:01.236 --> 01:43:02.446
没事了

1616
01:43:03.822 --> 01:43:04.781
海琴呢？
And Hae-geum?


1617
01:43:24.176 --> 01:43:25.010
怎么回事？

1618
01:43:28.138 --> 01:43:29.473
是海盗！
There's pirates!


1619
01:43:51.370 --> 01:43:52.913
-这些混蛋 -都死定了！
- Prepare to die! - You're all dead, dammit!


1620
01:43:53.455 --> 01:43:55.874
-扶我一把 -赶紧减肥吧 你这个大胖子
Lose some weight.


1621
01:44:41.336 --> 01:44:44.131
我找到宝物了！
I found the treasure!


1622
01:44:45.757 --> 01:44:47.384
找到宝物了！
Whoo!


1623
01:44:45.757 --> 01:44:47.384
I found the treasure!

1624
01:44:47.467 --> 01:44:48.302
I found the鈥?

1625
01:44:54.599 --> 01:44:55.517
不是 怎么说呢
Wait. So鈥?


1626
01:44:56.310 --> 01:44:57.144
该死
Ah, shit.


1627
01:44:59.479 --> 01:45:00.480
鸟哥们
Birdies,


1628
01:45:01.231 --> 01:45:02.107
听我说
just listen to me.


1629
01:45:02.190 --> 01:45:04.443
我不是要私吞这些东西
I'm not saying I'm going to keep this all for myself.


1630
01:45:04.526 --> 01:45:05.944
首先要离开这个岛
I'm saying, first, let's get off this island, huh?


1631
01:45:06.987 --> 01:45:08.488
然后再公平分配嘛
Then we divide it evenly.


1632
01:45:09.948 --> 01:45:12.743
你们得知道 我的手下多得惊人
You should know I have an enormous number of subordinates, okay?


1633
01:45:17.289 --> 01:45:20.375
要是在这里磨磨蹭蹭被发现 那就是劳而无功…
If I get caught here dillydallying鈥?It's鈥?it's a waste of my-- Ow!


1634
01:45:22.711 --> 01:45:23.628
这臭小子
How dare you!


1635
01:45:28.342 --> 01:45:30.010
老虎不发威 当我是病猫啊
You're pushing your luck!


1636
01:45:30.802 --> 01:45:32.012
我可是海盗王…
I'm the Pirate King--


1637
01:45:32.095 --> 01:45:33.013
Huh?

1638
01:46:23.855 --> 01:46:26.983
团长 船现在很危险
Captain, the ship, it's in terrible condition!


1639
01:46:27.067 --> 01:46:29.152
必须立即停止战斗 先修船！
We have to stop fighting and repair it immediately!


1640
01:46:48.046 --> 01:46:49.214
必须先修船
We must repair the ship.


1641
01:46:49.297 --> 01:46:51.091
要是失去这艘船 所有人都会死！
If this ship sinks, we'll all die!


1642
01:46:51.174 --> 01:46:53.385
反正你都要死了 还担心什么
You're about to die, anyway. So why do you care?


1643
01:47:58.909 --> 01:47:59.910
来了
I've returned.


1644
01:48:01.161 --> 01:48:02.787
海盗王小幕
I'm here to save you all!


1645
01:48:04.039 --> 01:48:06.291
来救你们了！
It is I, Mak-yi, the Pirate King!


1646
01:48:22.682 --> 01:48:23.892
把剑放下！
Throw away your sword!


1647
01:48:36.780 --> 01:48:37.614
抓紧了！
Hold on tight.


1648
01:48:38.615 --> 01:48:40.325
-抓紧了！ -怎么回事？
- Hold on tight. - What's happening?


1649
01:48:40.825 --> 01:48:43.870
这次是凤凰要飞起来了吗？
Is a phoenix taking off this time or something?


1650
01:48:43.954 --> 01:48:45.413
快下来！
Get down quickly!


1651
01:48:50.835 --> 01:48:52.379
你还好吗？
Hey. You okay?


1652
01:49:00.554 --> 01:49:01.763
为什么我看到两艘船？
Why do I see two ships?


1653
01:49:03.139 --> 01:49:04.015
你也是吗？
You too?


1654
01:49:04.724 --> 01:49:07.352
那个闪烁的东西是什么？
Yeah, but what's that sparkly thing?


1655
01:49:07.435 --> 01:49:09.145
是朱芳的船吗？
Did Joo Bang's ship survive?


1656
01:49:10.313 --> 01:49:11.940
那都是黄金吗？
Is that all gold in that ship?


1657
01:49:14.609 --> 01:49:15.944
足够了
Well, look at that.


1658
01:49:16.736 --> 01:49:18.613
我可以建立新的王国了
That's enough to build a new kingdom.


1659
01:49:27.455 --> 01:49:28.415
是黄金！
Gold!


1660
01:49:31.084 --> 01:49:31.918
把他们都杀了
Kill them all.


1661
01:49:32.752 --> 01:49:33.628
都杀掉
Kill them all!


1662
01:49:33.712 --> 01:49:35.463
快点过去！
Everybody, cross over!


1663
01:49:40.844 --> 01:49:42.220
团长！
Captain!


1664
01:49:43.096 --> 01:49:45.015
-开炮！ -快点啊 团长！
- Shoot at them! - Hurry, Captain!


1665
01:49:45.098 --> 01:49:46.224
发射！
Fire!


1666
01:49:48.268 --> 01:49:50.562
-团长！ -团长！
Captain! Let's go!


1667
01:49:50.645 --> 01:49:52.439
-不要啊！ -团长！
- Captain! - No!


1668
01:49:51.938 --> 01:49:53.231
Captain!

1669
01:50:04.618 --> 01:50:05.744
I got you!

1670
01:50:07.787 --> 01:50:08.997
你这个混蛋！

1671
01:50:10.123 --> 01:50:11.124
团长
Captain!


1672
01:50:12.667 --> 01:50:14.544
别碰那里 那里很痛
Captain!


1673
01:50:12.667 --> 01:50:15.378
Hey, hey. Don't touch there. It hurts!

1674
01:50:16.463 --> 01:50:17.422
差点就死了
God. I almost died.


1675
01:50:18.840 --> 01:50:20.342
团长没事！
The captain's okay!


1676
01:50:20.425 --> 01:50:21.343
Yeah!

1677
01:50:24.554 --> 01:50:25.930
团长是我！
I'm still the captain!


1678
01:50:28.099 --> 01:50:29.309
他又开始了
It's starting again.


1679
01:50:29.392 --> 01:50:31.895
在海洞中与无数巨龙搏斗后
After a battle against countless dragons in a sea cave,


1680
01:50:33.688 --> 01:50:35.231
我带来了这些宝物
I brought these treasures.


1681
01:50:38.109 --> 01:50:39.611
那里有多少条龙？
How many dragons were there?


1682
01:50:39.694 --> 01:50:41.529
3872条

1683
01:50:41.613 --> 01:50:45.492
已经找到宝物了 我们回家吧！
Now that we have the treasure,


1684
01:50:43.823 --> 01:50:45.283
it's time to go home!

1685
01:50:46.159 --> 01:50:48.244
回家吧！
Let's go home!


1686
01:50:50.163 --> 01:50:51.122
那是什么？

1687
01:50:54.250 --> 01:50:55.794
-地震？ -怎么回事？
What's that sound?


1688
01:50:56.670 --> 01:50:57.796
什么动静？
What was that?


1689
01:51:09.307 --> 01:51:10.725
一群龙要升天了
A horde of dragons has awakened.


1690
01:51:36.543 --> 01:51:38.086
扬帆起航！
Raise the sails!


1691
01:53:22.148 --> 01:53:23.483
团长！
Captain!


1692
01:53:24.317 --> 01:53:27.445
我发出信号时 你们把帆桁固定住！
When I give the signal, be sure to secure the sails!


1693
01:53:28.363 --> 01:53:29.364
是
Yes, Captain!


1694
01:53:30.573 --> 01:53:31.699
各就各位！
Everyone, get ready!


1695
01:53:33.785 --> 01:53:35.203
打起精神来 小子！
Pull yourself together, men!


1696
01:53:53.179 --> 01:53:54.013
就是现在！
Now pull!


1697
01:53:55.849 --> 01:53:57.058
拉！
Pull!


1698
01:54:14.450 --> 01:54:16.077
帮我！
Someone help me!


1699
01:54:18.413 --> 01:54:19.539
使劲拉！

1700
01:55:06.711 --> 01:55:07.670
我们活下来了吗？
Are we alive?


1701
01:55:08.254 --> 01:55:09.297
应该是阴间吧
This must be the afterlife.


1702
01:55:16.429 --> 01:55:18.431
活下来了！
We're alive! We're alive!


1703
01:55:19.223 --> 01:55:21.225
活下来了！
We're alive!


1704
01:55:23.519 --> 01:55:25.104
活下来了！
We're alive!


1705
01:55:36.824 --> 01:55:39.243
你做到了 团长！
So you made it, Captain!


1706
01:55:39.827 --> 01:55:41.412
现在轮到我了吗？
'Cause it's my turn now!


1707
01:55:44.082 --> 01:55:44.999
不要死
Don't die on me,


1708
01:55:46.334 --> 01:55:47.168
禹武治
Wu Mu-chi.


1709
01:55:54.467 --> 01:55:55.551
死在这里
If I die on this mountain,


1710
01:55:56.511 --> 01:55:58.930
浪儿会记得我吗？
will Rang remember me?


1711
01:55:58.388 --> 01:55:59.347
I wonder.

1712
01:56:10.608 --> 01:56:13.403
-头目！ -头目！

1713
01:56:17.573 --> 01:56:19.993
胜利永远属于强者
In the end, the strongest always wins.


1714
01:56:24.455 --> 01:56:26.249
禹武治！
Wu Mu-chi!


1715
01:57:03.327 --> 01:57:04.203
是这边！

1716
01:57:11.794 --> 01:57:13.629
-头目！ -姜燮！
- Boss! - Kang-seop!


1717
01:57:16.132 --> 01:57:17.383
禹武治也做到了
Wu Mu-chi succeeded as well.


1718
01:57:20.928 --> 01:57:21.846
干得好！
Look at this!


1719
01:57:22.346 --> 01:57:23.931
我找到宝物了！
I found the treasure!


1720
01:57:28.728 --> 01:57:29.854
Huh?

1721
01:57:36.194 --> 01:57:37.028
海琴
Hae-geum.


1722
01:57:43.826 --> 01:57:44.702
还活着吗？
Is she alive?


1723
01:57:49.082 --> 01:57:50.958
你吃饭了吗？
Hey. Did you eat yet?


1724
01:58:03.471 --> 01:58:04.847
朱芳怎么样了呢？
I wonder what happened to Joo Bang.


1725
01:58:05.848 --> 01:58:08.184
没有船 应该没有办法离开岛
He wouldn't have been able to leave the island without a boat.


1726
01:58:09.769 --> 01:58:11.437
沉睡在岛上的某个地方吧
He's probably asleep on the island somewhere,


1727
01:58:11.979 --> 01:58:13.314
怀着亡国之恨
full of sorrow for his ruined country.


1728
01:58:16.192 --> 01:58:17.068
什么亡国啊
What ruined country?


1729
01:58:17.652 --> 01:58:18.778
高丽已经重建了
Goryeo's been rebuilt.


1730
01:58:19.612 --> 01:58:20.488
以朝鲜之名
Joseon's it's name, now.


1731
01:58:21.405 --> 01:58:25.118
百姓就是国家 就是千年王国的栋梁
A country is its people,


1732
01:58:23.491 --> 01:58:25.368
the pillars聽of a thousand-year dynasty.

1733
01:58:28.871 --> 01:58:31.207
现在找到了宝物
So now that we found the treasure, um鈥?


1734
01:58:32.500 --> 01:58:34.752
-头目打算怎么做？ -头目？
鈥hat's Boss going to do?


1735
01:58:33.751 --> 01:58:34.752
Boss?

1736
01:58:35.545 --> 01:58:39.423
如果你非要留在船上 那我可以考虑合作
Well, if you insist on staying on the ship,


1737
01:58:37.922 --> 01:58:40.007
I'll have to rethink the leadership then.

1738
01:58:46.222 --> 01:58:49.100
-打算怎样做？ -我想想
- What do you say? - I need to think it over.


1739
01:58:53.354 --> 01:58:54.647
你要想到什么时候？
How long are you going to think about it?


1740
01:58:59.193 --> 01:59:00.361
假期结束了
Your vacation is over鈥?


1741
01:59:02.280 --> 01:59:03.114
团长
Captain.


1742
01:59:14.125 --> 01:59:14.959
全体注意
Attention!


1743
01:59:15.793 --> 01:59:16.669
你真要离开吗？
Are you really leaving us?


1744
01:59:18.462 --> 01:59:19.547
我也没办法
Do I have any other choice?


1745
01:59:20.506 --> 01:59:21.924
一船容不下两条龙
You cannot have two dragons on one ship.


1746
01:59:22.925 --> 01:59:25.636
如果有缘 总有一天会再相见
If it is our fate, I suppose we will meet again.


1747
01:59:27.680 --> 01:59:29.515
只要你不离开大海
As long as you're still on the sea, Captain.


1748
01:59:31.058 --> 01:59:33.144
不过团长 这里哪有岛啊？
But I'm confused. Where's the island here?


1749
01:59:33.769 --> 01:59:35.605
我明明要求把我送到安全的岛上
I asked to be taken to a safe island.


1750
01:59:36.981 --> 01:59:38.232
岛就在那边
The island is over there.


1751
01:59:39.025 --> 01:59:39.942
在哪里？
Where?


1752
01:59:40.610 --> 01:59:41.694
那个岛啊
That island.


1753
01:59:41.777 --> 01:59:43.237
那是岛吗？是礁石
That's not an island, it's a rock.


1754
01:59:46.199 --> 01:59:48.618
我们把重点放在了你所说的安全性
We paid particular attention to the safety you mentioned.


1755
01:59:49.285 --> 01:59:51.120
既没有山中野兽 也没有平原野兽
There are no mountain beasts or wild animals.


1756
01:59:51.204 --> 01:59:52.830
而且连官军也没有
What's more, no soldiers either.


1757
01:59:52.914 --> 01:59:53.831
Exactly!

1758
01:59:55.041 --> 01:59:57.043
我敢断言没有比那里更安全的地方
I assure you there's no safer place.


1759
01:59:57.126 --> 01:59:58.252
是啊
He's right!


1760
01:59:58.336 --> 02:00:00.963
没有水喝 也没有地方伸腿啊
When there's no fresh water, or room to stretch your legs!


1761
02:00:01.047 --> 02:00:03.549
世界上没有完美的地方
There is no place in this world that is perfect.


1762
02:00:03.633 --> 02:00:04.634
没错
Exactly!


1763
02:00:08.095 --> 02:00:10.097
放下仇恨吧
Joo Bang, rest in peace.


1764
02:00:14.101 --> 02:00:15.436
我会像义贼一样
'Cause we are honest bandits. we'll use it well to help the common folk.


1765
02:00:16.187 --> 02:00:18.481
帮助老百姓

1766
02:00:20.107 --> 02:00:22.652
你还没回答我呢
So you didn't answer my question.


1767
02:00:22.735 --> 02:00:23.861
Hmm?

1768
02:00:23.945 --> 02:00:26.697
Ah.

1769
02:00:32.620 --> 02:00:33.829
Oh, Hae-rang.

1770
02:00:35.081 --> 02:00:36.666
真是的 等我一会儿嘛
- Hmm? - Hey. Just stay still, will you?


1771
02:00:37.750 --> 02:00:38.751
干什么？
What?


1772
02:00:41.545 --> 02:00:42.380
回答
My answer.


1773
02:00:43.256 --> 02:00:44.715
打算留下来吗？
Are you saying you'll stay?


1774
02:00:44.799 --> 02:00:46.133
曾是高丽第一剑客的我
The former Greatest Swordsman


1775
02:00:47.176 --> 02:00:48.344
愿与你同行到天涯海角
chooses to walk alongside you.


1776
02:00:49.720 --> 02:00:50.805
傻子
Idiot.


1777
02:00:52.348 --> 02:00:54.392
那样的话 至少也得有点表示
For me to know, you have to do this.


1778
02:00:58.145 --> 02:00:59.188
团长！
Captain?


1779
02:01:02.566 --> 02:01:03.734
Huh? What?

1780
02:01:04.360 --> 02:01:05.569
他们什么时候好上的？
Since when were those two鈥?


1781
02:01:05.653 --> 02:01:07.405
没发现吗？剁鱼头的时候啊
You didn't know? While they were cutting fish heads.


1782
02:01:09.907 --> 02:01:10.741
你们又搞哪出？
What's going on?


1783
02:01:12.743 --> 02:01:13.828
这些人
Them too?


1784
02:01:13.911 --> 02:01:15.621
宝物有什么用！
What's the use of treasure, dammit?


1785
02:01:17.039 --> 02:01:17.873
我不需要这些
Ugh. I don't need any of this.


1786
02:01:22.753 --> 02:01:23.879
请停下来！
Please, stop already! Stop!


1787
02:01:24.880 --> 02:01:25.715
拜托！
Come on!


1788
02:05:53.941 --> 02:05:55.568
