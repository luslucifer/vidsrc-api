J&H Scrap.
You bring us trash,
we pay you cash.


9
00:02:15.372 --> 00:02:16.736
Oh, sure thing.
I'll get him.


10
00:02:17.211 --> 00:02:20.113
Hank! Phone!

11
00:02:21.644 --> 00:02:23.677
Okey-doke.

12
00:02:23.677 --> 00:02:26.053
Bruce, when are you gonna
start answering the phone?


13
00:02:26.053 --> 00:02:28.715
Living here
rent-free.


14
00:02:29.652 --> 00:02:31.421
Yell-o. Hello?

15
00:02:32.226 --> 00:02:33.720
Weird.
There's nobody there.


16
00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.920
What do you mean?
I was just talking
to her.


17
00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.363
Hello? Hello?
What on earth?


18
00:02:41.893 --> 00:02:43.763
The door's locked.

19
00:02:43.763 --> 00:02:45.732
There's
somebody
outside.


20
00:02:45.732 --> 00:02:48.603
What? Where?
Look. Over there.


21
00:02:48.603 --> 00:02:50.935
What are they doing?

22
00:02:50.935 --> 00:02:53.949
Looks like
they're stealing
the crane!


23
00:02:56.778 --> 00:02:59.779
Oh, my goodness.
They're heading straight
for the welding tanks!


24
00:03:22.604 --> 00:03:25.805
Hello? PAW Patrol?
This is Janet from J&H Scrap.


25
00:03:25.805 --> 00:03:27.906
The whole place
is burning down!


26
00:03:27.906 --> 00:03:29.149
You've got to come quick!

27
00:03:46.762 --> 00:03:49.367
All right, pups,
we've got a fire
at the scrapyard.


28
00:03:49.367 --> 00:03:51.996
And by the sounds of it,
we don't have much time.


29
00:03:51.996 --> 00:03:54.966
No fire's too big,
no pup's too small!


30
00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.349
Skye, you are clear
for takeoff.


31
00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:06.153
Let's take to the sky!

32
00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.158
And away we go!

33
00:04:16.495 --> 00:04:18.726
Pups, get ready to launch.

34
00:04:52.927 --> 00:04:55.268
PAW Patrol is on a roll!

35
00:05:17.017 --> 00:05:18.786
I've got eyes
on the fire.


36
00:05:18.786 --> 00:05:21.855
It's a big one.
I'm going in for a water drop.


37
00:05:36.102 --> 00:05:39.378
The entrance is blocked.
I'm gonna clear a way in.


38
00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:48.585
Whoo! Bullseye!

39
00:05:48.585 --> 00:05:52.325
Hot dog! It's the PAW Patrol!
They're gonna save us!


40
00:05:52.325 --> 00:05:54.987
The PAW Patrol! Oh, Bruce,
you're gonna love them.


41
00:05:54.987 --> 00:05:58.265
They're cute little puppies
who drive around in cars.


42
00:05:58.265 --> 00:06:00.432
I know that sounds weird,
but just go with it.


43
00:06:04.603 --> 00:06:07.241
All right, Marshall,
let's fight that fire.


44
00:06:07.241 --> 00:06:09.177
Arf! Water cannon!

45
00:06:33.236 --> 00:06:34.631
- Help!
- Over here!


46
00:06:34.631 --> 00:06:36.094
Help!
Help!


47
00:06:36.094 --> 00:06:37.667
Help us!

48
00:06:37.667 --> 00:06:39.768
Marshall, the trailer's
on fire!


49
00:06:39.768 --> 00:06:41.473
I'm all out of water!

50
00:06:41.473 --> 00:06:43.508
- Oh, no.
- Incoming!


51
00:06:49.483 --> 00:06:51.142
Yeah, Skye!

52
00:07:05.024 --> 00:07:08.027
You see that right there?
That's why she's
my favorite pup.


53
00:07:08.027 --> 00:07:09.501
PAW Patrol!

54
00:07:09.501 --> 00:07:11.338
Let's get you out of there.

55
00:07:12.737 --> 00:07:15.199
Whoa!

56
00:07:15.199 --> 00:07:16.541
Oh!

57
00:07:16.541 --> 00:07:18.037
Oops. Sorry.

58
00:07:18.037 --> 00:07:20.347
And that's why
I wear a hard hat.


59
00:07:21.416 --> 00:07:24.175
Oh, thank you,
thank you, thank you!


60
00:07:24.175 --> 00:07:27.783
We're just glad you're okay.
Hopefully there's not
too much damage.


61
00:07:27.783 --> 00:07:31.215
Well, the good thing
is it was all junk
to begin with.


62
00:07:31.215 --> 00:07:34.361
These are the brave pups
I was telling you about.


63
00:07:34.361 --> 00:07:36.891
This is Bruce.
He's a sensitive soul.


64
00:07:36.891 --> 00:07:38.761
This is all
a bit much for him.


65
00:07:40.026 --> 00:07:42.567
Hey, let's get a picture
with Bruce and the pups.


66
00:07:42.567 --> 00:07:44.030
Oh, great idea.

67
00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:46.736
Janet, grab the little one
so she gets in the photo.


68
00:07:46.736 --> 00:07:49.167
I'm fine down here.
Come here, sweetie.


69
00:07:49.167 --> 00:07:51.235
Everybody say, "Junk."

70
00:07:51.235 --> 00:07:52.742
Junk!

71
00:07:54.515 --> 00:07:57.351
Ugh! I hate being
the smallest pup.


72
00:07:57.351 --> 00:08:00.783
If she picked me up like that,
I'd have hit her
with the dog breath.


73
00:08:03.918 --> 00:08:07.559
That trailer was locked
from the outside.
How did that happen?


74
00:08:07.559 --> 00:08:10.760
Well, you're not
gonna believe this,
but somebody locked us up


75
00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:14.192
so they could steal
our 10-ton electromagnet.


76
00:08:14.192 --> 00:08:17.965
Who would want to steal
a 10-ton electromagnet?


77
00:08:39.824 --> 00:08:41.725
It's showtime.

78
00:08:46.829 --> 00:08:48.633
Hey, what's going on, everybody?

79
00:08:48.633 --> 00:08:52.164
I'm Sam Stringer here,
reporting live from
downtown Adventure City,


80
00:08:52.164 --> 00:08:54.298
where we're about to see
the largest meteor shower


81
00:08:54.298 --> 00:08:56.674
we've had in over 50 years.

82
00:08:56.674 --> 00:08:59.578
Meteor! Meteor! Meteor!

83
00:08:59.578 --> 00:09:02.812
Ah, I'm just so excited
to see the meteor, Chickaletta.


84
00:09:04.242 --> 00:09:06.453
As you can see,
it's meteor fever out here,


85
00:09:06.453 --> 00:09:09.489
and everyone is turning
their eyes to the sky.


86
00:09:09.489 --> 00:09:12.657
Meteor! Meteor! Meteor...

87
00:09:21.327 --> 00:09:22.370
See any meteors?

88
00:09:24.097 --> 00:09:26.440
All I can see
is your giant head.


89
00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:28.970
Oops. Sorry.

90
00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:32.006
Come on, Rubble.
You're gonna miss the meteor.


91
00:09:32.006 --> 00:09:33.513
Do you really
expect me to watch


92
00:09:33.513 --> 00:09:36.846
a once-in-a-lifetime
celestial event
without snacks?


93
00:09:42.491 --> 00:09:45.085
Hey, Chase,
you have a rip
in your suit.


94
00:09:45.085 --> 00:09:46.625
I do?

95
00:09:46.625 --> 00:09:49.463
Yeah. Looks like
you're too big for
this thing already.


96
00:09:49.463 --> 00:09:51.465
You're all growing so fast.

97
00:09:51.465 --> 00:09:54.028
All of us? Even me?

98
00:09:54.028 --> 00:09:57.504
Not yet, Skye. You're still
pretty much the same size.


99
00:09:57.504 --> 00:10:00.738
But it's nothing
to worry about. All pups
grow at their own speed.


100
00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:04.203
And some of us
never grow at all.


101
00:10:05.908 --> 00:10:07.239
Oh, great.
They're here.


102
00:10:08.748 --> 00:10:11.881
Come on up. Pups,
we've got company.


103
00:10:13.588 --> 00:10:15.885
I'd like you to meet
the Junior Patrollers.


104
00:10:15.885 --> 00:10:17.216
Nano.
Hello!


105
00:10:17.216 --> 00:10:18.349
Mini.
Hi!


106
00:10:18.349 --> 00:10:20.186
And Tot.
What's up?


107
00:10:20.186 --> 00:10:22.529
When they grow up,
they want to be
in the PAW Patrol.


108
00:10:22.529 --> 00:10:25.257
So I invited them to watch
the meteor shower with us.


109
00:10:25.257 --> 00:10:26.995
You're Chase.

110
00:10:26.995 --> 00:10:28.227
Uh, yep.

111
00:10:28.227 --> 00:10:30.163
You're on the case.

112
00:10:30.163 --> 00:10:31.505
I guess I am.

113
00:10:32.673 --> 00:10:34.574
And you're Rubble!

114
00:10:34.574 --> 00:10:37.302
Cool glasses.
Thank you.


115
00:10:37.302 --> 00:10:40.404
Wow, Skye, I'm almost
as tall as you!


116
00:10:40.404 --> 00:10:45.519
Well, I'm definitely taller.
But not for long.


117
00:10:45.519 --> 00:10:47.411
Why don't you guys
check out the telescope?


118
00:10:47.411 --> 00:10:49.380
Whoa!
My turn, my turn!


119
00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:51.690
Whoa, whoa, whoa...
Whoa, whoa!


120
00:10:52.792 --> 00:10:54.286
Take it easy, puffballs.

121
00:10:54.286 --> 00:10:55.892
This thing is expensive.

122
00:10:55.892 --> 00:10:56.992
Oops.
Whoops.


123
00:10:56.992 --> 00:10:58.466
Sorry.

124
00:10:58.466 --> 00:11:00.534
Let's try that again.

125
00:11:00.534 --> 00:11:03.900
Take a look through
the eyepiece and tell us
what you see.


126
00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:06.936
Carefully look through
the eyepiece. Carefully.


127
00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:13.041
I don't know about this whole
"Junior Patrollers" thing.


128
00:11:13.041 --> 00:11:14.548
I mean, when did
the PAW Patrol become


129
00:11:14.548 --> 00:11:16.077
a babysitting service?

130
00:11:16.077 --> 00:11:17.749
Come on, Liberty.

131
00:11:17.749 --> 00:11:20.048
Don't write them off
just because they're small.


132
00:11:20.048 --> 00:11:21.115
Whoa!

133
00:11:21.115 --> 00:11:22.721
Look at all the stars.

134
00:11:22.721 --> 00:11:24.756
There must be
a billion of them.


135
00:11:24.756 --> 00:11:26.219
We should count them all.

136
00:11:26.219 --> 00:11:27.319
Okay.

137
00:11:27.319 --> 00:11:33.666
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven...


138
00:11:42.235 --> 00:11:46.844
Hello, world. Hello, universe.
Hello, Internet!


139
00:11:46.844 --> 00:11:48.714
My name is Victoria Vance,

140
00:11:48.714 --> 00:11:50.947
and I'm making
this video as proof


141
00:11:50.947 --> 00:11:53.719
that I'm the greatest
scientist in history.


142
00:11:53.719 --> 00:11:56.117
Oh, and don't
believe the rumors.


143
00:11:56.117 --> 00:11:58.383
I'm not a mad scientist.

144
00:11:58.383 --> 00:12:01.595
I mean, sure, sometimes
I act a little mad,


145
00:12:01.595 --> 00:12:03.828
and I am a scientist,

146
00:12:03.828 --> 00:12:07.326
but that doesn't make me
a mad scientist.


147
00:12:07.326 --> 00:12:09.163
You got that? Good.

148
00:12:11.264 --> 00:12:16.137
Now, I've been
tracking meteor X-2805
for the past two years.


149
00:12:16.137 --> 00:12:19.008
It contains some kind of
power source


150
00:12:19.008 --> 00:12:21.978
stronger than anything
we've ever seen on Earth.


151
00:12:21.978 --> 00:12:26.147
Which brings me to my latest
invention, the Meteor Magnet!


152
00:12:27.788 --> 00:12:29.887
Cool name, right?

153
00:12:29.887 --> 00:12:31.988
This sweet little tractor beam

154
00:12:31.988 --> 00:12:34.254
will pull that meteor
out of the sky


155
00:12:34.254 --> 00:12:37.323
and gently deliver
it to my doorstep.


156
00:12:40.196 --> 00:12:43.527
Now, let's get ready to party.

157
00:13:01.481 --> 00:13:03.283
Whoo-hoo!

158
00:13:03.283 --> 00:13:05.659
I've locked on to the meteor
and I'm reeling it in!


159
00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:11.896
I did it. I did it!

160
00:13:11.896 --> 00:13:14.701
Me. Victoria Vance.

161
00:13:14.701 --> 00:13:17.671
To all the haters out there
who laughed at me


162
00:13:17.671 --> 00:13:22.302
and called me a mad scientist,
who's laughing now?


163
00:13:26.176 --> 00:13:27.406
Uh-oh.

164
00:13:30.114 --> 00:13:32.620
No! No, no, no!

165
00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:34.886
The meteor is stronger
than I expected.


166
00:13:44.093 --> 00:13:46.557
I don't have enough power!

167
00:13:56.602 --> 00:13:59.614
That is not good.

168
00:14:07.481 --> 00:14:10.889
...3,034, 3,035,

169
00:14:10.889 --> 00:14:15.586
3,036, 3,037, 3,038...

170
00:14:15.586 --> 00:14:17.731
There it is!

171
00:14:17.731 --> 00:14:19.733
Whoa.

172
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.594
I didn't think
it would be so bright.


173
00:14:23.594 --> 00:14:25.673
It looks like it's headed
straight for us.


174
00:14:28.368 --> 00:14:31.074
That's because it is!

175
00:14:31.074 --> 00:14:33.010
Everybody out
of the pup tower!


176
00:14:43.418 --> 00:14:46.089
Get those
people inside! Go, go, go!


177
00:14:46.089 --> 00:14:49.994
Everybody out of the street!
You need to take cover
right now!


178
00:14:49.994 --> 00:14:53.063
Take shelter!
The meteor's heading
straight for us!


179
00:14:59.135 --> 00:15:01.676
Everybody inside! Get inside!

180
00:15:07.077 --> 00:15:08.639
Oh!
Come on, buddy.
Get up. Let's go.


181
00:15:10.643 --> 00:15:13.347
Get out of the street!
We don't have much time!


182
00:15:15.681 --> 00:15:16.691
Clear!

183
00:15:18.354 --> 00:15:19.353
Street's clear!

184
00:15:20.191 --> 00:15:21.256
Clear!

185
00:15:21.256 --> 00:15:23.192
Good job, pups.
Now take cover!


186
00:15:41.575 --> 00:15:42.640
Get down!

187
00:15:56.722 --> 00:15:58.095
Is everybody okay?

188
00:15:58.933 --> 00:15:59.932
I'm okay.

189
00:16:01.364 --> 00:16:03.397
I'm good.

190
00:16:03.397 --> 00:16:06.697
I'm fine, but I'm gonna need
a serious bath.


191
00:16:12.309 --> 00:16:14.111
Oh, my goodness.

192
00:16:14.111 --> 00:16:16.212
Wait. Where are
the Junior Patrollers?


193
00:16:16.918 --> 00:16:19.413
Nano? Mini? Tot?

194
00:16:20.449 --> 00:16:21.514
Whoa!

195
00:16:21.514 --> 00:16:24.825
That was epic.

196
00:16:24.825 --> 00:16:27.553
I'm so glad nobody got hurt.

197
00:16:28.424 --> 00:16:30.424
Oh, no. Look.

198
00:16:33.627 --> 00:16:38.003
The pup tower.
It's completely destroyed.


199
00:16:42.108 --> 00:16:44.405
Our home.
Our vehicles.


200
00:16:45.243 --> 00:16:47.210
It's all gone.

201
00:16:58.894 --> 00:17:00.927
That little thing
did all this?


202
00:17:07.329 --> 00:17:11.971
This meteor is
giving off some kind of
strange energy pulse.


203
00:17:11.971 --> 00:17:14.600
Let's get it out of here until
we find out what's going on.


204
00:17:20.113 --> 00:17:22.608
At approximately 7:31 p.m.,

205
00:17:22.608 --> 00:17:25.314
a meteor, which was meant
to safely pass by the planet,


206
00:17:25.314 --> 00:17:28.955
suddenly veered off course,
crashing into Adventure City,


207
00:17:28.955 --> 00:17:31.320
causing massive destruction!

208
00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:35.159
I was there, people!
I almost got squashed!


209
00:17:35.159 --> 00:17:37.689
Whew! Okay.

210
00:17:37.689 --> 00:17:40.395
The mad scientist
Victoria Vance was arrested


211
00:17:40.395 --> 00:17:42.793
after taking credit
for the disaster online.


212
00:17:42.793 --> 00:17:47.435
<i>I did it! Me.
Victoria Vance.</i>


213
00:17:47.435 --> 00:17:50.207
Yikes. Ooh!
That's an open and shut case.


214
00:17:57.775 --> 00:17:59.612
You can't lock me up!

215
00:17:59.612 --> 00:18:03.385
I'm the greatest scientist
in the world!


216
00:18:03.385 --> 00:18:05.684
More like the maddest
scientist in the world.


217
00:18:05.684 --> 00:18:07.158
I heard that.

218
00:18:07.158 --> 00:18:10.656
I am not a mad scientist!

219
00:18:18.039 --> 00:18:19.764
Hello, roomie.

220
00:18:43.788 --> 00:18:46.527
It looks like
it stopped glowing.


221
00:18:46.527 --> 00:18:49.937
Maybe that's a good thing.
The glowing freaks me out.


222
00:19:01.181 --> 00:19:04.182
This will analyze the meteor
and tell us what it's made of.


223
00:19:04.182 --> 00:19:07.053
We'll leave it scanning
overnight and see what
we can learn.


224
00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:15.028
All right, pups, time for bed.

225
00:19:20.464 --> 00:19:21.529
Argh, come on.

226
00:19:21.529 --> 00:19:23.234
Need a little help
there, Skye?


227
00:19:23.234 --> 00:19:25.104
Nope. No, I got it.

228
00:19:51.759 --> 00:19:54.925
Good night, pups.
If you need me,
I'm just down the hall.


229
00:19:54.925 --> 00:19:56.795
Ryder?
Yeah?


230
00:19:56.795 --> 00:20:00.535
I miss the pup tower.
I don't like sleeping
in new places.


231
00:20:00.535 --> 00:20:03.043
I'm never gonna be able
to get to sleep.


232
00:20:03.043 --> 00:20:07.476
Well, we've all had
a long day. You're probably
more tired than you think.


233
00:20:14.912 --> 00:20:16.287
See you in the morning.

234
00:20:41.842 --> 00:20:44.216
Rubble, quit messing
with the light.


235
00:20:47.947 --> 00:20:49.683
Rubble!

236
00:20:53.194 --> 00:20:54.589
What is that?

237
00:22:08.797 --> 00:22:09.895
Weird.

238
00:22:14.132 --> 00:22:15.406
I didn't do it!

239
00:22:40.994 --> 00:22:42.268
No way.

240
00:22:54.414 --> 00:22:55.512
Whoa.

241
00:22:57.714 --> 00:22:58.812
Whoa!

242
00:23:03.619 --> 00:23:04.752
Whoa.

243
00:23:05.689 --> 00:23:06.688
Whoa.

244
00:23:21.199 --> 00:23:24.805
Looks like the smallest pup
just became the strongest pup.


245
00:23:34.487 --> 00:23:37.323
All right, let's see
what this thing
can really do.


246
00:23:40.823 --> 00:23:41.855
Whoa!

247
00:23:42.988 --> 00:23:45.199
What's going on?
Is everybody okay?


248
00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:49.929
I think I've got superpowers.

249
00:23:52.032 --> 00:23:53.130
Whoa.

250
00:23:54.034 --> 00:23:55.737
Whoa.

251
00:23:55.737 --> 00:23:57.541
No way.

252
00:24:01.349 --> 00:24:04.746
This is the weirdest dream
I've ever had.


253
00:24:04.746 --> 00:24:08.255
Uh, Rubble,
you're not dreaming.


254
00:24:08.255 --> 00:24:11.852
Oh. Then this is the weirdest
awake I've ever had.


255
00:24:25.472 --> 00:24:27.505
Look at your paws.

256
00:24:31.841 --> 00:24:33.379
Whoa.

257
00:24:33.379 --> 00:24:35.744
It's some kind of fireball.

258
00:24:35.744 --> 00:24:38.582
Well, that makes sense.
You're a fire pup.


259
00:24:38.582 --> 00:24:40.551
I wonder what
your power is.


260
00:24:42.588 --> 00:24:44.687
- Huh? Chase?
- Marshall!


261
00:24:44.687 --> 00:24:48.592
Up here!
Hey, how'd you get
over there so fast?


262
00:24:49.958 --> 00:24:51.430
Get over where?

263
00:24:54.765 --> 00:24:56.567
Great. Now the clumsy pup

264
00:24:56.567 --> 00:24:58.536
shoots fireballs
out of his paws.


265
00:24:58.536 --> 00:25:00.197
Don't worry. I got it.

266
00:25:04.379 --> 00:25:07.677
Dudes,
I'm one with the water.


267
00:25:11.617 --> 00:25:12.814
Awesome.

268
00:25:19.284 --> 00:25:21.790
Check me out.
I'm a walking magnet.


269
00:25:22.496 --> 00:25:24.155
Huh?

270
00:25:28.632 --> 00:25:29.732
Sorry about that.

271
00:25:31.329 --> 00:25:34.099
Cool. I'm a wrecking ball.

272
00:25:39.843 --> 00:25:42.173
Whoa, Rubble, are you okay?

273
00:25:43.077 --> 00:25:44.780
Rock 'n' roll!

274
00:25:51.085 --> 00:25:52.722
What's your power, Liberty?

275
00:25:52.722 --> 00:25:55.428
That's a good question.
I'm trying to figure it out.


276
00:25:55.428 --> 00:25:57.859
Okay, come on. Here we go.
Superpowers on three.


277
00:25:58.466 --> 00:26:00.961
One, two, three.

278
00:26:01.898 --> 00:26:03.161
Whoa!

279
00:26:03.161 --> 00:26:04.965
Okay, okay.

280
00:26:04.965 --> 00:26:07.935
It's not
the power of flight.


281
00:26:07.935 --> 00:26:11.576
That's because
it's magnet paws!


282
00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:14.139
Nope.

283
00:26:18.717 --> 00:26:21.883
That's it.
I'm a superpowered
wrecking ball!


284
00:26:23.348 --> 00:26:24.622
Yeah!

285
00:26:24.622 --> 00:26:25.656
Whoo!

286
00:26:29.286 --> 00:26:32.124
What's going on here?
I've got no powers.


287
00:26:32.124 --> 00:26:33.158
What a rip-off.

288
00:26:34.227 --> 00:26:37.536
Skye can fly.
Marshall can control fire.


289
00:26:37.536 --> 00:26:39.538
Zuma turns to water.

290
00:26:39.538 --> 00:26:42.134
It's like these crystals
amplify something about you.


291
00:26:42.774 --> 00:26:45.203
But I'm just Liberty.

292
00:26:45.203 --> 00:26:46.369
What's my thing?

293
00:27:00.286 --> 00:27:04.189
Now that we're super,
we're gonna need a new name
for ourselves.


294
00:27:04.189 --> 00:27:08.061
Why do we need a new name?
We're the PAW Patrol.


295
00:27:08.061 --> 00:27:10.228
I know, but now we're more.

296
00:27:10.228 --> 00:27:13.132
It's like we've got something
just a little bit extra.


297
00:27:13.607 --> 00:27:15.002
Ooh! I know.

298
00:27:15.002 --> 00:27:16.509
How about we call ourselves

299
00:27:16.509 --> 00:27:21.811
"the PAW Patrol But More
With Just A Little Bit Extra"?


300
00:27:23.342 --> 00:27:25.815
It doesn't exactly
roll off the tongue.


301
00:27:27.685 --> 00:27:31.458
How about "the Mighty Pups"?

302
00:28:01.182 --> 00:28:03.622
Ready for action,
Ryder, sir!


303
00:28:17.770 --> 00:28:19.297
Whoa!

304
00:28:32.554 --> 00:28:35.819
<i>Chase, Marshall,
ready for launch.</i>


305
00:28:35.819 --> 00:28:37.315
Power paws!

306
00:28:37.315 --> 00:28:42.056
<i>Ten, nine, eight,</i>

307
00:28:42.056 --> 00:28:47.633
<i>seven, six, five, four...</i>

308
00:28:47.633 --> 00:28:51.131
<i>...three, two, one,</i>

309
00:28:52.871 --> 00:28:53.870
<i>go!</i>

310
00:29:02.881 --> 00:29:04.474
Power paws!

311
00:29:06.852 --> 00:29:09.116
<i>Skye, Rocky,</i>

312
00:29:10.658 --> 00:29:11.690
<i>go!</i>

313
00:29:16.356 --> 00:29:19.632
<i>Zuma, Rubble,
ready for launch.</i>


314
00:29:19.632 --> 00:29:23.603
- Did he say "lunch"?
<i>- No, I said launch!</i>


315
00:29:23.603 --> 00:29:25.231
<i>Go!</i>

316
00:29:29.677 --> 00:29:31.204
Uh, Ryder?

317
00:29:31.204 --> 00:29:34.713
As you know, I didn't get
any superpowers.


318
00:29:34.713 --> 00:29:36.682
So, I'm not totally sure
what to do here.


319
00:29:36.682 --> 00:29:38.816
I've been thinking
about that, Liberty,


320
00:29:38.816 --> 00:29:41.181
and I've got a very important
mission for you.


321
00:29:41.181 --> 00:29:44.283
You do? Yes! That's what
I'm talking about!


322
00:29:44.283 --> 00:29:47.022
Whatever you need,
anything at all, I'm your pup.


323
00:29:47.022 --> 00:29:50.696
Great. I need you
to hang back and look after
the Junior Patrollers.


324
00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:54.964
Oh, that's not a good idea.
Nope. Mm-mm.


325
00:29:54.964 --> 00:29:56.328
I'm trying to be
more flexible,


326
00:29:56.328 --> 00:29:59.034
but I don't know the first
thing about little kids.


327
00:29:59.034 --> 00:30:01.498
Don't worry, Liberty.
You'll be great at it.


328
00:30:01.498 --> 00:30:03.335
Mighty Pups are on a roll!

329
00:30:05.372 --> 00:30:10.078
Ryder, come back!
I'm not built for babysitting!


330
00:30:18.385 --> 00:30:19.384
Oh!

331
00:31:03.661 --> 00:31:05.430
<i>When we hear
the word "superpowers,"</i>


332
00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:07.267
we usually think of big-budget
Hollywood movies


333
00:31:07.267 --> 00:31:09.434
starring overpaid celebrities
wearing tights.


334
00:31:09.434 --> 00:31:11.634
But now we know
superpowers are real.


335
00:31:11.634 --> 00:31:15.638
And the fluffy little doggies
who got them call themselves
"the Mighty Pups."


336
00:31:15.638 --> 00:31:17.211
Help!

337
00:31:32.998 --> 00:31:37.033
They got new powers,
new uniforms
and new merchandise.


338
00:31:37.033 --> 00:31:39.904
To all the parents
out there, I'm sorry.


339
00:31:43.811 --> 00:31:45.272
That was my meteor.

340
00:31:45.272 --> 00:31:47.406
Those should be
my superpowers.


341
00:31:47.406 --> 00:31:49.980
I can't stand
those little mongrels.


342
00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:52.510
I can't stand
the PAW Patrol either.


343
00:31:52.510 --> 00:31:55.986
That's what makes us
such perfect roommates.


344
00:31:55.986 --> 00:31:57.757
Yeah, well, don't get
too attached.


345
00:31:57.757 --> 00:31:59.649
As soon as I can find
my way out of here,


346
00:31:59.649 --> 00:32:01.695
I'm gonna get
my meteor back.


347
00:32:02.687 --> 00:32:03.862
Can you give us a minute?

348
00:32:03.862 --> 00:32:05.864
I need to discuss
something in private


349
00:32:05.864 --> 00:32:07.690
with my colleagues.

350
00:32:14.336 --> 00:32:16.666
Okay, here's the deal.

351
00:32:16.666 --> 00:32:19.812
The kitties and I
have been planning
a jailbreak.


352
00:32:19.812 --> 00:32:21.473
We'll help you
fly the coop


353
00:32:21.473 --> 00:32:25.510
if you promise to share
some of those superpowers
with me.


354
00:32:25.510 --> 00:32:27.380
Do we have a deal?

355
00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:32.187
I don't really have a lot
of options right now,
so sure, it's a deal.


356
00:32:32.187 --> 00:32:34.860
It's only a deal
if we shake on it.


357
00:32:36.193 --> 00:32:37.225
Ugh.

358
00:32:37.225 --> 00:32:39.260
We all shake on it.

359
00:32:42.364 --> 00:32:44.364
Ugh! Are you kidding me?

360
00:32:47.169 --> 00:32:51.107
Excellent, excellent.
Sealing the deal.
Wonderful.


361
00:32:51.107 --> 00:32:53.670
Now, if you'll direct
your attention over there,


362
00:32:53.670 --> 00:32:56.882
I left you
a little surprise
in the toilet.


363
00:32:58.710 --> 00:33:01.183
Yeah. No, thanks.
I'm good.


364
00:33:01.183 --> 00:33:03.790
Don't be shy.
Lift the lid.


365
00:33:11.391 --> 00:33:14.757
That's the most beautiful
thing I've ever seen.


366
00:33:14.757 --> 00:33:17.430
It took me a lot
of hard work.


367
00:33:25.011 --> 00:33:27.704
<i>The Mighty Pups have
incredible superpowers.</i>


368
00:33:27.704 --> 00:33:32.346
<i>Skye can fly, Chase has
super speed and Rubble
is a real-life wrecking ball.</i>


369
00:33:32.346 --> 00:33:34.249
Okay, no more messing around.

370
00:33:34.249 --> 00:33:38.616
My superpower is fire paws!

371
00:33:40.125 --> 00:33:42.895
Nope. Okay. Okay. That's okay.

372
00:33:42.895 --> 00:33:45.326
It's super speed.

373
00:33:50.430 --> 00:33:52.432
I think I'm gonna be sick.

374
00:33:52.432 --> 00:33:54.797
<i>Thanks to
the superpowers contained
in the mysterious meteor,</i>


375
00:33:54.797 --> 00:33:57.800
<i>these pups are truly unstoppable.</i>

376
00:33:57.800 --> 00:34:01.375
Come on, Liberty.
Be flexible. Be flexible!


377
00:34:01.375 --> 00:34:04.851
<i>Adventure City simply
can't get enough
of these Mighty Pups.</i>


378
00:34:05.645 --> 00:34:06.809
Hey!

379
00:34:06.809 --> 00:34:09.779
We were watching that.
That's the problem.


380
00:34:09.779 --> 00:34:12.320
We're just sitting
around watching.


381
00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:15.994
We might not have superpowers,
but that doesn't mean
we can't contribute.


382
00:34:15.994 --> 00:34:17.996
I can't believe
I'm saying this,


383
00:34:17.996 --> 00:34:21.758
but are you three puffballs
serious about joining
the PAW Patrol one day?


384
00:34:21.758 --> 00:34:23.793
Yes!
Absolutely!


385
00:34:23.793 --> 00:34:26.763
More than anything
in the entire universe!


386
00:34:26.763 --> 00:34:29.601
Then you guys are going
to be my personal project.


387
00:34:29.601 --> 00:34:31.306
I'm gonna teach you
everything I know,


388
00:34:31.306 --> 00:34:35.310
and turn you into lean, mean,
fluffy little rescue machines.


389
00:34:35.310 --> 00:34:36.707
Wicked!

390
00:34:39.052 --> 00:34:42.889
...97, 98, 99, 100.

391
00:34:42.889 --> 00:34:44.055
Your turn.

392
00:34:44.816 --> 00:34:46.519
One...
One...


393
00:34:48.721 --> 00:34:50.963
Yeesh.

394
00:34:50.963 --> 00:34:54.329
You're running with the big
dogs now! No pain, no gain!


395
00:35:03.703 --> 00:35:05.406
Let's do this!

396
00:35:06.506 --> 00:35:09.245
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

397
00:35:11.579 --> 00:35:13.150
Ugh.

398
00:35:13.150 --> 00:35:14.877
<i>Come on! Move it, move it!</i>

399
00:35:14.877 --> 00:35:17.088
<i>We're gonna take you
from puff to tough!</i>


400
00:35:17.088 --> 00:35:19.816
<i>Is that all you got?
I thought you wanted
to be in the PAW Patrol.</i>


401
00:35:19.816 --> 00:35:21.455
<i>I want to see you hustle.</i>

402
00:35:22.491 --> 00:35:24.326
<i>Go, go, go!</i>

403
00:35:24.326 --> 00:35:27.428
<i>You're lean, you're mean,
you're a fluffy little
rescue machine!</i>


404
00:35:27.428 --> 00:35:28.891
Take it easy, Liberty.

405
00:35:28.891 --> 00:35:32.400
Remember, the Junior Patroller
program is just for fun.


406
00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:35.304
And there's nothing
more fun than realizing
your full potential.


407
00:35:35.304 --> 00:35:36.404
Huh?

408
00:35:36.404 --> 00:35:38.043
<i>I didn't say stop.</i>

409
00:35:38.043 --> 00:35:39.440
<i>Move it, move it, move it!</i>

410
00:35:50.913 --> 00:35:53.652
Not much further.
We're almost there.


411
00:35:53.652 --> 00:35:56.028
You said that
two miles ago.


412
00:35:56.028 --> 00:35:59.460
Oh, stop complaining.
Just be happy
I broke you out of jail.


413
00:36:02.531 --> 00:36:06.236
I'll be happy when I have
something else to look at.


414
00:36:06.236 --> 00:36:07.897
We're here!

415
00:36:17.018 --> 00:36:18.776
Ah!

416
00:36:18.776 --> 00:36:21.548
The sweet smell of freedom.

417
00:36:23.187 --> 00:36:26.454
Is that Humdinger?
What's he doing
out of jail?


418
00:36:26.454 --> 00:36:30.788
It is me. And I hope
I can count on your support
in the next election.


419
00:36:30.788 --> 00:36:33.428
Stop campaigning.
We're fugitives on the run.


420
00:36:33.428 --> 00:36:35.001
Sorry. I forgot.

421
00:36:35.001 --> 00:36:39.203
It's just so nice
to be reunited
with my adoring public.


422
00:36:39.203 --> 00:36:41.271
Ha! I didn't vote for you.

423
00:36:41.271 --> 00:36:45.077
Me neither.
You were the worst mayor
the city's ever had.


424
00:36:45.077 --> 00:36:48.641
Hmm! This is why I hate
free and fair elections.


425
00:36:48.641 --> 00:36:50.643
We just got to keep
a low profile


426
00:36:50.643 --> 00:36:54.152
until we get those superpowers
from the PAW Patrol.


427
00:36:54.152 --> 00:36:56.814
And how do you propose
we do that?


428
00:36:56.814 --> 00:37:01.489
We give them the one thing
they can't resist.


429
00:37:10.533 --> 00:37:11.730
There it is.

430
00:37:11.730 --> 00:37:15.437
- Air Humdinger.
- It's perfect.


431
00:37:15.437 --> 00:37:17.043
Oh, I've missed you.

432
00:37:17.043 --> 00:37:20.475
I had nightmares in jail
about flying coach.


433
00:37:22.444 --> 00:37:26.008
Are you sure you know
how to fly this thing?


434
00:37:26.008 --> 00:37:29.385
Oh, don't worry.
Your tacky little jet
is in good hands.


435
00:37:29.385 --> 00:37:32.388
I've been flying planes
like this since I was
in grade school.


436
00:37:34.128 --> 00:37:35.688
Must have been
a good school.


437
00:37:51.242 --> 00:37:52.969
<i>Autopilot activated.</i>

438
00:37:52.969 --> 00:37:56.775
Now we just fly around
until the PAW Patrol
comes to rescue us.


439
00:37:56.775 --> 00:37:59.778
And why would they do that?
Because of this.


440
00:38:03.353 --> 00:38:05.190
Are you out
of your mind?


441
00:38:05.918 --> 00:38:07.016
Whee!

442
00:38:08.690 --> 00:38:10.195
What are you doing?

443
00:38:10.195 --> 00:38:14.397
Now we're in trouble.
They'll have to come
rescue us!


444
00:38:14.397 --> 00:38:16.729
That was your plan?

445
00:38:16.729 --> 00:38:18.533
Uh-huh!

446
00:38:18.533 --> 00:38:22.504
Now sit down and eat
some cashews while
I go yelp for help!


447
00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:30.611
Stop, drop and roll!

448
00:38:32.415 --> 00:38:33.647
Did you see that?

449
00:38:33.647 --> 00:38:36.221
They're getting it.
These pups are legit.


450
00:38:36.221 --> 00:38:40.390
I'm happy for you, Liberty,
but maybe it's time
for a break.


451
00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:42.227
Do you guys want a break?

452
00:38:42.227 --> 00:38:44.559
We don't need
no stinking break!


453
00:38:44.559 --> 00:38:47.166
Ha-ha! That's what
I'm talking about, puffballs.


454
00:38:48.233 --> 00:38:49.729
PAW Patrol.
What's your emergency?


455
00:38:49.729 --> 00:38:53.205
<i>Mayday, mayday!
This is flight HD9904.</i>


456
00:38:53.205 --> 00:38:56.637
<i>We need immediate assistance.</i>
Hang tight. We're on our way.


457
00:39:04.581 --> 00:39:07.978
Skye, I need you
to fly up there and carry
that plane down safely.


458
00:39:07.978 --> 00:39:09.221
Are you up for it?

459
00:39:09.221 --> 00:39:12.785
I'm a Mighty Pup.
I was made for this.


460
00:39:12.785 --> 00:39:15.293
We'll provide ground support.
Come on, pups.


461
00:39:17.361 --> 00:39:19.330
Let's take to the sky!

462
00:39:37.449 --> 00:39:39.317
The PAW Patrol is here!

463
00:39:39.317 --> 00:39:42.419
Cut the engines and I'll carry
the plane down safely.


464
00:39:42.419 --> 00:39:45.147
And here you are!

465
00:39:45.147 --> 00:39:46.390
Humdinger?

466
00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:49.987
It worked exactly like
she said it would.


467
00:39:49.987 --> 00:39:51.956
Like who said it would?

468
00:39:51.956 --> 00:39:53.056
Me.

469
00:39:53.056 --> 00:39:54.299
My crystal!

470
00:39:54.299 --> 00:39:57.269
It's like taking candy
from a baby.


471
00:39:57.269 --> 00:39:58.765
Give that back.

472
00:39:58.765 --> 00:40:00.063
Ooh!

473
00:40:00.063 --> 00:40:01.801
You're a feisty one,
aren't you?


474
00:40:05.541 --> 00:40:08.940
Catch you around, pipsqueak.
Buh-bye!


475
00:40:10.042 --> 00:40:11.349
No!

476
00:40:11.349 --> 00:40:13.318
Thank you for flying
Air Humdinger.


477
00:40:14.418 --> 00:40:16.178
Whoo-hoo!

478
00:40:47.684 --> 00:40:49.717
Ryder, come in.
This is Skye.


479
00:40:49.717 --> 00:40:50.949
<i>How's it going
up there?</i>


480
00:40:50.949 --> 00:40:52.687
It was a trap.

481
00:40:52.687 --> 00:40:56.526
They stole my crystal,
I've got no powers and
this plane is going down.


482
00:40:56.526 --> 00:40:57.857
<i>Where are you right now?</i>

483
00:40:59.331 --> 00:41:01.993
I can't get a visual. Hang on.

484
00:41:01.993 --> 00:41:03.797
<i>Can you make it back
to the airport?</i>


485
00:41:06.736 --> 00:41:10.606
Negative. It's too far.
I need a place to land
this thing now.


486
00:41:13.039 --> 00:41:14.874
Copy that.
We'll have to improvise.


487
00:41:23.918 --> 00:41:25.654
Skye,
we're clearing a runway.


488
00:41:25.654 --> 00:41:27.854
I need you to set a course
for Main Street.


489
00:41:27.854 --> 00:41:30.153
Did you say Main Street?
<i>Affirmative.</i>


490
00:41:30.153 --> 00:41:32.793
That's the busiest street
in Adventure City.


491
00:41:34.368 --> 00:41:35.730
It's also the longest.

492
00:41:40.537 --> 00:41:43.903
All right, pups.
We need to make a runway
and we don't have much time.


493
00:41:43.903 --> 00:41:46.235
Let's move it, people.

494
00:41:46.235 --> 00:41:50.173
You don't have to go home,
but you can't stay here.


495
00:41:50.173 --> 00:41:52.780
Chase, mark the runway.
All the way down.


496
00:41:52.780 --> 00:41:54.210
Chase is on the case.

497
00:41:55.422 --> 00:41:57.389
Arf! Flares!

498
00:41:59.283 --> 00:42:02.427
I feel the need
for super speed.


499
00:42:24.517 --> 00:42:27.980
This intersection is closed!

500
00:42:27.980 --> 00:42:29.685
<i>I've got a visual
on the runway.</i>


501
00:42:30.655 --> 00:42:32.622
All right, let's do this.

502
00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:41.730
Close your eyes and listen to
the calming sound of my voice.


503
00:42:46.330 --> 00:42:48.506
I'm on final approach.

504
00:42:51.544 --> 00:42:52.642
Oh, no.

505
00:42:56.613 --> 00:42:57.845
I'm going under!

506
00:43:00.883 --> 00:43:02.014
Whoa!

507
00:43:05.184 --> 00:43:09.318
Come on, baby.
Soft landing. Soft landing.


508
00:43:12.026 --> 00:43:14.367
Oof! Okay, hard landing.

509
00:43:18.131 --> 00:43:19.097
Whoa.

510
00:43:21.539 --> 00:43:24.003
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!


511
00:43:35.146 --> 00:43:37.555
Now that's a nice parking job.

512
00:43:51.230 --> 00:43:53.032
They're back.
Come on. They're back.


513
00:43:53.032 --> 00:43:54.869
Awesome!
Yeah!


514
00:43:55.366 --> 00:43:56.409
How'd it go?

515
00:43:56.906 --> 00:43:58.268
Not good.

516
00:43:58.268 --> 00:44:00.809
Come on. You guys
are the Mighty Pups.


517
00:44:00.809 --> 00:44:04.109
How bad could it be?
It was a trap.


518
00:44:04.109 --> 00:44:06.078
Skye's crystal was stolen.

519
00:44:06.751 --> 00:44:07.816
Oh.

520
00:44:07.816 --> 00:44:10.181
So, really, really not good.

521
00:44:26.265 --> 00:44:29.574
Hey, Skye. You doing okay?

522
00:44:29.574 --> 00:44:32.401
I can't believe
I lost my crystal.


523
00:44:32.401 --> 00:44:35.107
It could have happened
to any one of us.


524
00:44:35.107 --> 00:44:38.616
But it didn't.
It happened to me.


525
00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:46.415
When I was born,
I was the runt
of the litter.


526
00:44:46.415 --> 00:44:47.988
Do you know
what that means?


527
00:44:47.988 --> 00:44:50.122
That you were
the smallest?


528
00:44:50.122 --> 00:44:52.729
The smallest
and the weakest.


529
00:45:04.105 --> 00:45:05.973
<i>It's not easy
being the smallest.</i>


530
00:45:09.814 --> 00:45:12.782
<i>You learn pretty early on
that everything's gonna be
harder for you.</i>


531
00:45:30.065 --> 00:45:33.297
<i>When you're the smallest,
you're always picked last.</i>


532
00:45:38.843 --> 00:45:41.646
<i>And sometimes
you're never picked at all.</i>


533
00:45:57.697 --> 00:46:01.567
<i>Eventually,
I realized that
if I wanted a better life,</i>


534
00:46:01.567 --> 00:46:03.965
<i>I needed to take matters
into my own hands.</i>


535
00:46:21.545 --> 00:46:23.248
No! Come back!

536
00:46:52.213 --> 00:46:54.587
I've got you. It's okay.

537
00:46:56.547 --> 00:46:58.052
Let's get you
out of the cold.


538
00:47:06.062 --> 00:47:10.735
I shouldn't even be in
the PAW Patrol. Ryder didn't
want another pup.


539
00:47:10.735 --> 00:47:13.903
And if he did,
he sure wouldn't have picked
one as small as me.


540
00:47:14.741 --> 00:47:16.202
I had no idea.

541
00:47:18.041 --> 00:47:21.207
When I had superpowers,
for the first time in my life


542
00:47:21.207 --> 00:47:23.946
I didn't feel
like the smallest
and the weakest.


543
00:47:25.950 --> 00:47:28.412
I'd do anything
to get that crystal back.


544
00:47:42.131 --> 00:47:45.561
Amazing.
That's your best time yet!


545
00:47:45.561 --> 00:47:48.003
Hey, Liberty.
Can I talk to you
for a second?


546
00:47:49.138 --> 00:47:51.468
Okay, puffballs, take five.

547
00:47:51.468 --> 00:47:54.108
Better yet, take zero.
Do some push-ups.


548
00:47:59.245 --> 00:48:03.612
I'm telling you, Ryder,
these puffballs
are the real deal.


549
00:48:03.612 --> 00:48:07.583
Liberty, we've got to end
the Junior Patroller program.


550
00:48:07.583 --> 00:48:10.256
What?
It's too dangerous.


551
00:48:10.256 --> 00:48:12.797
Skye's superpowers have fallen
into the wrong hands,


552
00:48:12.797 --> 00:48:15.558
and we have no idea
what's coming.


553
00:48:15.558 --> 00:48:17.659
But the puffballs can help.

554
00:48:17.659 --> 00:48:19.298
Sure, they're little,
but I've heard you say,


555
00:48:19.298 --> 00:48:23.071
"No pup's too small,"
like, a million times.


556
00:48:23.071 --> 00:48:26.041
I know the Junior Patrollers
mean the world to you,


557
00:48:26.041 --> 00:48:29.077
but for now,
we need to keep them safe.


558
00:48:29.077 --> 00:48:31.849
That means we need
to send them home.


559
00:48:31.849 --> 00:48:34.049
Do you want to tell them
or should I?


560
00:48:35.250 --> 00:48:36.689
Tell us what?

561
00:48:40.717 --> 00:48:45.291
Nano, Mini, Tot,
I've got some tough news.


562
00:48:45.291 --> 00:48:47.623
I'm ending
the Junior Patroller program.


563
00:48:47.623 --> 00:48:49.031
What?

564
00:48:49.031 --> 00:48:51.231
- No.
- I'm sorry.


565
00:48:51.231 --> 00:48:54.432
Hopefully, we can
start it again when
things are safe.


566
00:48:55.237 --> 00:48:56.874
When is that gonna be?

567
00:48:58.504 --> 00:48:59.668
I don't know.

568
00:49:17.094 --> 00:49:21.723
Ryder, I'm sorry
I lost my crystal.


569
00:49:21.723 --> 00:49:26.299
It's not your fault.
I never should have
sent you up there alone.


570
00:49:26.299 --> 00:49:27.872
I just keep thinking,

571
00:49:27.872 --> 00:49:31.403
if I wasn't so small,
I could've stopped them
from taking it.


572
00:49:31.403 --> 00:49:34.505
Don't be so hard on yourself.
We're gonna get it back.


573
00:49:34.505 --> 00:49:37.574
I've set the computer to scan
the city sector by sector,


574
00:49:37.574 --> 00:49:40.049
looking for the energy
signature of the crystal.


575
00:49:40.049 --> 00:49:43.085
Just say the word,
I'm ready to go.


576
00:49:43.085 --> 00:49:47.023
Skye, I'm gonna need
you to stay behind
on this mission.


577
00:49:47.023 --> 00:49:48.354
What?

578
00:49:48.354 --> 00:49:50.356
You don't have
superpowers anymore.


579
00:49:51.095 --> 00:49:54.426
But I have to do something.

580
00:49:54.426 --> 00:49:57.066
My job is to keep you safe.

581
00:49:57.066 --> 00:50:00.201
Until we get
that crystal back,
I need you to stay here.


582
00:50:00.201 --> 00:50:02.533
That's not fair.

583
00:50:02.533 --> 00:50:05.503
I'm sorry, Skye.
But my decision is final.


584
00:50:06.440 --> 00:50:07.879
Try and get some rest.

585
00:50:34.732 --> 00:50:35.907
Finally.

586
00:50:37.007 --> 00:50:39.273
I wonder what
my superpower will be.


587
00:50:39.273 --> 00:50:40.340
Ooh!

588
00:50:40.340 --> 00:50:42.573
Ow!
Don't touch.


589
00:50:47.811 --> 00:50:49.646
Ooh!

590
00:50:49.646 --> 00:50:50.779
It tingles.

591
00:50:53.454 --> 00:50:56.719
I have the power
to control electricity.


592
00:51:01.033 --> 00:51:04.628
For someone who hates
being called a mad scientist,


593
00:51:04.628 --> 00:51:07.037
this is not helping
your image!


594
00:51:09.338 --> 00:51:11.437
I'm just gonna
stand over here.


595
00:51:13.507 --> 00:51:18.180
This is incredible!
I can feel the energy
surging through me!


596
00:51:21.812 --> 00:51:22.987
Stop that!

597
00:51:22.987 --> 00:51:26.419
The static electricity
is ruining my moustache.


598
00:51:27.849 --> 00:51:31.094
And look what it's done
to the kitties!


599
00:51:31.094 --> 00:51:34.823
The problem with
the Meteor Magnet was
it never had enough power.


600
00:51:34.823 --> 00:51:36.462
But now look at me.

601
00:51:36.462 --> 00:51:38.233
I just need to make
a few modifications,


602
00:51:38.233 --> 00:51:41.005
and I can give it
all the power it needs.


603
00:51:42.600 --> 00:51:46.637
I'll finally be able to catch
all the meteors I want!


604
00:51:46.637 --> 00:51:49.706
Why on earth do you need
more meteors?


605
00:51:49.706 --> 00:51:52.280
You saw what kind of power
was in the first one.


606
00:51:52.280 --> 00:51:54.150
Who knows what else
is out there?


607
00:52:02.094 --> 00:52:03.621
<i>Energy signature detected.</i>

608
00:52:04.492 --> 00:52:06.063
<i>Energy signature detected.</i>

609
00:52:06.063 --> 00:52:07.933
My crystal.

610
00:52:21.410 --> 00:52:25.445
If I'm gonna get
my crystal back, I'm gonna
need all the power I can get.


611
00:52:51.075 --> 00:52:52.670
That's all of them.

612
00:52:52.670 --> 00:52:55.277
I'll have these crystals
back before anyone knows
they're gone.


613
00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:19.972
Gotcha. Switching engines
to stealth mode.


614
00:54:34.475 --> 00:54:35.542
Oh, no, you don't!

615
00:54:40.910 --> 00:54:41.977
Ta-ta.

616
00:54:44.014 --> 00:54:45.090
Get back here!

617
00:54:56.664 --> 00:54:58.730
Is that really as fast
as you can go?


618
00:55:08.212 --> 00:55:11.743
Oh, do you need me
to slow down so you
can keep up, little pup?


619
00:55:23.196 --> 00:55:24.162
Oh!

620
00:55:28.397 --> 00:55:32.203
You're so predictable.
Let me out of here!


621
00:55:32.203 --> 00:55:34.865
Not so super inside
a force field, are you?


622
00:55:41.676 --> 00:55:43.478
Don't feel bad
for losing.


623
00:55:43.478 --> 00:55:46.976
People have been
underestimating me
my entire life.


624
00:55:49.321 --> 00:55:50.914
Thanks for the crystals, though.

625
00:55:52.819 --> 00:55:54.258
No!

626
00:56:03.467 --> 00:56:06.336
Time to put all of
this power to work!


627
00:56:07.306 --> 00:56:08.371
Ha!

628
00:56:35.266 --> 00:56:36.861
This is incredible!

629
00:56:36.861 --> 00:56:39.963
I can reach further into space
than ever before.


630
00:56:39.963 --> 00:56:42.471
Stop! What you're doing
is dangerous.


631
00:56:42.471 --> 00:56:43.835
People could get hurt.

632
00:56:47.476 --> 00:56:51.777
And why should I care
about other people?
They never cared about me.


633
00:56:51.777 --> 00:56:54.076
No matter how smart I was,

634
00:56:54.076 --> 00:56:58.949
they laughed at me
and called me a mad scientist.


635
00:56:58.949 --> 00:57:01.622
So, I took matters
into my own hands.


636
00:57:01.622 --> 00:57:03.987
I promised myself
I'd never let anyone


637
00:57:03.987 --> 00:57:09.498
make me feel small
and insignificant ever again.


638
00:57:09.498 --> 00:57:12.160
I'm sorry that
happened to you.


639
00:57:12.160 --> 00:57:14.998
Oh, what would you
know about anything?
You're just a dog.


640
00:57:17.101 --> 00:57:21.202
I know what
it's like to feel small
and insignificant.


641
00:57:21.202 --> 00:57:26.141
Like you have to work
twice as hard as everyone else
just to prove you belong.


642
00:57:26.141 --> 00:57:29.617
That's why I risked everything
to get my crystal back.


643
00:57:29.617 --> 00:57:33.214
But all I did
was make things worse.


644
00:57:33.214 --> 00:57:35.755
Turns out I am too small
to make a difference.


645
00:57:40.661 --> 00:57:43.433
Ooh!

646
00:57:43.433 --> 00:57:46.766
That was good. I know
what you're trying to do.


647
00:57:46.766 --> 00:57:51.342
We have a little
bonding moment,
I get all soft and blubbery,


648
00:57:51.342 --> 00:57:53.905
then I have a change of heart
and let you go?


649
00:57:53.905 --> 00:57:55.313
Well, it's never gonna happen!

650
00:57:56.413 --> 00:57:59.416
Who are you talking to?
Ooh, is that Skye?


651
00:58:00.144 --> 00:58:01.880
Humdinger.

652
00:58:01.880 --> 00:58:04.619
She was kind enough
to bring me the rest
of the crystals.


653
00:58:04.619 --> 00:58:06.357
Aren't they beautiful?

654
00:58:06.357 --> 00:58:10.592
Now remember, we had a deal.
One of those crystals is mine.


655
00:58:10.592 --> 00:58:12.462
Ugh! Fine.
A deal's a deal.


656
00:58:13.124 --> 00:58:14.794
Oh! Oh! Ah!

657
00:58:16.094 --> 00:58:18.259
Oh, my goodness.
I can talk!


658
00:58:19.568 --> 00:58:21.471
I have so much to say!

659
00:58:21.471 --> 00:58:22.835
Give me that crystal!

660
00:58:24.639 --> 00:58:27.939
How do I turn this thing on?
Come on, superpowers.


661
00:58:28.777 --> 00:58:30.447
Ahhh!

662
00:58:31.549 --> 00:58:32.581
Wow!

663
00:58:32.581 --> 00:58:35.815
Oh!

664
00:58:47.156 --> 00:58:49.059
Would you look at that?

665
00:58:51.866 --> 00:58:56.132
Ooh, I always
knew I'd make it big
in Adventure City.


666
00:58:56.132 --> 00:59:00.301
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to pay a visit
to the PAW Patrol.


667
00:59:00.301 --> 00:59:03.975
Those pups and I have got some
unfinished business.


668
00:59:07.110 --> 00:59:08.243
Oh, no.

669
00:59:11.820 --> 00:59:14.425
Ryder! Ryder! Ryder!

670
00:59:14.425 --> 00:59:17.021
Skye's gone.
She took the crystals!


671
00:59:17.021 --> 00:59:18.187
What?

672
00:59:24.294 --> 00:59:26.668
Skye, this is Ryder. Come in.

673
00:59:26.668 --> 00:59:28.868
Skye, this is Ryder.
Do you read me?


674
00:59:33.675 --> 00:59:36.205
The computer found
the missing crystal.


675
00:59:36.205 --> 00:59:37.778
She must've gone after it.

676
00:59:37.778 --> 00:59:39.274
Oh, no.

677
00:59:39.274 --> 00:59:41.617
Come on, pups.
Skye needs our help.


678
00:59:41.617 --> 00:59:46.050
How are we supposed
to help Skye if we don't
have our superpowers?


679
00:59:46.050 --> 00:59:48.316
Looks like we're doing this
the old-fashioned way.


680
00:59:48.316 --> 00:59:49.889
Then I'm coming with you.

681
01:00:00.163 --> 01:00:01.197
What was that?

682
01:00:04.805 --> 01:00:07.005
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

683
01:00:08.976 --> 01:00:10.239
Earthquake!

684
01:00:11.374 --> 01:00:13.044
I don't think
that's an earthquake.


685
01:00:15.686 --> 01:00:16.883
Well, well, well.

686
01:00:16.883 --> 01:00:20.249
If it isn't my old friends,
the PAW Patrol.


687
01:00:20.856 --> 01:00:22.020
Humdinger.

688
01:00:22.020 --> 01:00:23.923
He looks different
than I remember.


689
01:00:25.058 --> 01:00:26.156
I'm stuck!

690
01:00:32.571 --> 01:00:34.032
- Gotcha.
- Go!


691
01:00:38.511 --> 01:00:40.478
Spread out
and don't get stepped on.


692
01:00:44.845 --> 01:00:47.177
Hold still
so I can squash you.


693
01:00:50.380 --> 01:00:51.588
Get out of the road!

694
01:00:53.590 --> 01:00:57.759
What kind of heartless monster
steps on an ice cream truck?


695
01:01:02.731 --> 01:01:06.328
Ah, there's nothing better
than a day at the salon.


696
01:01:10.035 --> 01:01:11.641
Oh, you've got
to be kidding me.


697
01:01:11.641 --> 01:01:13.269
Arf! Sidecar!

698
01:01:19.244 --> 01:01:20.243
Hey!

699
01:01:26.317 --> 01:01:29.593
Hey, I know you.
You're in the PAW Patrol.


700
01:01:29.593 --> 01:01:31.419
I was thinking
maybe I should join.


701
01:01:31.419 --> 01:01:34.191
I mean, not to do
the rescues or anything, obviously,


702
01:01:34.191 --> 01:01:36.127
but, like,
your social media
or whatever.


703
01:01:36.127 --> 01:01:38.162
Hang on!

704
01:01:45.336 --> 01:01:47.303
Sorry about that!

705
01:01:47.303 --> 01:01:49.943
On second thought,
who needs a job?


706
01:01:49.943 --> 01:01:51.549
Ew!

707
01:01:51.549 --> 01:01:53.441
You're not
getting away that easy.


708
01:01:53.441 --> 01:01:54.486
Ugh!

709
01:01:55.786 --> 01:01:56.884
Get back here!

710
01:02:03.827 --> 01:02:05.420
It's a dead end!

711
01:02:05.420 --> 01:02:06.498
Turn around!

712
01:02:12.361 --> 01:02:16.772
Looks like it's the end
of the road, PAW Patrol.


713
01:02:16.772 --> 01:02:17.839
What do we do?

714
01:02:17.839 --> 01:02:19.973
I don't know.
We're trapped!


715
01:02:26.586 --> 01:02:29.048
Junior Patrol is on a roll!

716
01:02:29.048 --> 01:02:31.083
It's the Junior Patrollers!

717
01:02:38.992 --> 01:02:40.125
Ahhh!

718
01:02:40.125 --> 01:02:41.995
What is that?
Get it off! Get it off!


719
01:02:47.132 --> 01:02:48.804
Operation Allergies.

720
01:02:48.804 --> 01:02:49.904
Go!

721
01:02:51.235 --> 01:02:53.578
Ah... Ah... Ah...

722
01:02:54.339 --> 01:02:55.976
Ah... Ah...

723
01:02:55.976 --> 01:02:57.648
He's gonna blow!

724
01:03:09.726 --> 01:03:12.190
Marshall, the crystal's
in his jacket pocket!


725
01:03:12.190 --> 01:03:13.257
I'm on it.

726
01:03:20.431 --> 01:03:22.167
- Got it.
- Oh, no, you don't!


727
01:03:22.167 --> 01:03:23.806
Marshall!

728
01:03:23.806 --> 01:03:27.172
Nobody messes
with Giant Humdinger.


729
01:03:28.745 --> 01:03:30.208
Ow!

730
01:03:30.208 --> 01:03:33.684
If you mess with the fire pup,
you're gonna get burned.


731
01:03:33.684 --> 01:03:36.445
Ooh, that's a hot one-liner.

732
01:03:36.445 --> 01:03:37.479
He's shrinking!

733
01:03:48.129 --> 01:03:49.128
Ahhh!

734
01:03:51.130 --> 01:03:53.066
Whoa! Whoa!

735
01:03:55.904 --> 01:03:58.676
Humdinger,
you're going back to jail.


736
01:03:58.676 --> 01:04:01.404
Oh, not again.

737
01:04:03.716 --> 01:04:07.916
That's what I'm talking about.
Lean, mean, fluffy little
rescue machines.


738
01:04:07.916 --> 01:04:11.282
Hop in, puffballs.
You ride with me.


739
01:04:16.091 --> 01:04:19.697
Nice work, Marshall.
Let's take that crystal
and go get Skye.


740
01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:39.079
So many meteors,
so little time.


741
01:04:39.079 --> 01:04:40.113
Ooh!

742
01:04:52.488 --> 01:04:55.590
Can't you read?
The sign says "keep out"!


743
01:04:58.428 --> 01:05:00.298
Ugh!

744
01:05:14.787 --> 01:05:16.446
Hello!

745
01:05:16.446 --> 01:05:19.449
We're going door to door
selling Pup Club cookies.


746
01:05:19.449 --> 01:05:22.991
Can we interest you
in a sweet and tasty treat?


747
01:05:22.991 --> 01:05:24.762
I'm listening.
What do you got?


748
01:05:27.932 --> 01:05:31.098
Vance is distracted
at the door.
Zuma, you're up.


749
01:05:31.870 --> 01:05:33.463
Aye-aye, Ryder, sir.

750
01:05:36.039 --> 01:05:39.469
We got plain,
sprinkles, caramel...


751
01:05:43.343 --> 01:05:45.409
- No. No. Pass.
- Spicy ginger...


752
01:05:45.409 --> 01:05:46.476
Ooh!

753
01:05:47.710 --> 01:05:48.720
Surf's up.

754
01:06:02.395 --> 01:06:06.331
So, we can't eat
chocolate, but we'll take
your word for it.


755
01:06:06.331 --> 01:06:08.003
We'll take your order now,

756
01:06:08.003 --> 01:06:11.072
and you will get your cookies
in six to eight weeks.


757
01:06:12.471 --> 01:06:13.745
That seems
like a long time.


758
01:06:16.244 --> 01:06:19.883
Skye? Skye? Where are you?

759
01:06:20.413 --> 01:06:21.445
Zuma?

760
01:06:23.581 --> 01:06:27.616
Oh, it's good to see you.
Time to bust out of here.


761
01:06:31.391 --> 01:06:32.797
Power paws.

762
01:06:36.396 --> 01:06:39.232
Oh, I don't think so.

763
01:06:47.108 --> 01:06:51.948
Only one of you has powers!
Ha! You're no match for me!


764
01:06:54.711 --> 01:06:56.315
We're a team.

765
01:06:56.315 --> 01:06:59.219
When you go up
against one of us,
you go up against all of us.


766
01:06:59.219 --> 01:07:00.682
Fine. Have it your way.

767
01:07:01.960 --> 01:07:04.125
Chase!
Got it.


768
01:07:04.125 --> 01:07:05.192
Marshall!

769
01:07:18.700 --> 01:07:19.767
Coming in hot!

770
01:07:37.224 --> 01:07:38.225
Rocky!

771
01:07:41.228 --> 01:07:42.295
Look out!

772
01:07:48.567 --> 01:07:50.765
Keep your hands off
our vehicles.


773
01:07:50.765 --> 01:07:52.536
You tell her, Rocky!

774
01:07:54.177 --> 01:07:55.176
Rubble!

775
01:07:57.673 --> 01:07:59.279
Power paws!

776
01:08:09.621 --> 01:08:11.027
Skye!
On it.


777
01:08:11.623 --> 01:08:12.787
Oh, no, you don't.

778
01:08:15.825 --> 01:08:16.824
Chase!

779
01:08:36.879 --> 01:08:39.055
Look at me.

780
01:08:39.055 --> 01:08:41.255
I'm... I'm stretchy!

781
01:08:41.255 --> 01:08:45.259
That's my superpower!
I'm elastic and fantastic.


782
01:08:45.259 --> 01:08:47.426
Uh, Liberty?

783
01:08:47.426 --> 01:08:49.857
Can you please
get us out of here?
No problem.


784
01:08:54.367 --> 01:08:56.237
Nice catch, Liberty!

785
01:08:56.237 --> 01:09:00.208
I've been trying
to be more flexible,
but this is ridiculous.


786
01:09:00.208 --> 01:09:03.277
All right, puppies,
playtime's over!


787
01:09:03.277 --> 01:09:05.246
Give me back
that crystal!


788
01:09:06.414 --> 01:09:07.413
Zuma!

789
01:09:16.556 --> 01:09:19.293
Where'd he go?
Over here, dude!


790
01:09:20.395 --> 01:09:21.966
You got to be
faster than that.


791
01:09:23.959 --> 01:09:25.794
You can't hide forever!

792
01:09:30.669 --> 01:09:31.833
Huh?

793
01:09:39.777 --> 01:09:42.019
These crystals
belong to us, dude.


794
01:09:43.286 --> 01:09:44.384
No!

795
01:09:59.335 --> 01:10:02.765
It's time to shut down
that Meteor Magnet
once and for all.


796
01:10:04.802 --> 01:10:08.441
Hey, Rubble.
Want to go for a ride?


797
01:10:08.441 --> 01:10:10.608
Teamwork makes
the dream work.


798
01:10:13.976 --> 01:10:17.153
No! No! Stop!
What are you doing?
Fire!


799
01:10:19.817 --> 01:10:20.948
No!

800
01:10:25.856 --> 01:10:28.395
Oh, yeah.
How do you like me now?


801
01:10:33.169 --> 01:10:36.205
Victoria Vance,
you are under arrest.


802
01:10:36.801 --> 01:10:38.108
Ooh!

803
01:10:38.108 --> 01:10:40.770
You're in big trouble!

804
01:10:40.770 --> 01:10:42.442
You'll have to
catch me first!


805
01:10:43.445 --> 01:10:44.972
Where do you think
you're going?


806
01:10:53.191 --> 01:10:56.159
You mangy mutts
think you're so smart,


807
01:10:56.159 --> 01:11:00.097
but those meteors
are coming down whether
you like it or not.


808
01:11:01.461 --> 01:11:02.990
She's telling the truth.

809
01:11:02.990 --> 01:11:05.366
There's hundreds of meteors
heading straight for the city.


810
01:11:06.699 --> 01:11:09.733
What have you done?
What can I say?


811
01:11:09.733 --> 01:11:12.901
I guess I am a mad scientist.

812
01:11:16.412 --> 01:11:18.874
Finally, she admits it.

813
01:11:18.874 --> 01:11:21.316
Skye, I need you
to fly up there


814
01:11:21.316 --> 01:11:25.012
and destroy as many
of those meteors as you can.


815
01:11:25.012 --> 01:11:28.686
You still believe in me after
everything that's happened?


816
01:11:28.686 --> 01:11:31.557
I've always believed
in you, Skye.


817
01:11:31.557 --> 01:11:34.659
You're the reason I started
saying, "No pup's too small."


818
01:11:36.927 --> 01:11:39.169
I'll give it
everything I got, Ryder.


819
01:11:40.568 --> 01:11:42.062
Wait.

820
01:11:42.062 --> 01:11:44.999
If you're going up
against those meteors,


821
01:11:44.999 --> 01:11:47.144
you better take
all the power you can get.


822
01:12:03.888 --> 01:12:05.393
We believe in you, Skye.

823
01:12:06.561 --> 01:12:07.923
I won't let you down.

824
01:12:12.897 --> 01:12:14.633
Let's take to the sky.

825
01:12:17.572 --> 01:12:21.068
Okay, pups, we've got a city
to evacuate. Let's move!


826
01:12:42.729 --> 01:12:43.794
Where are you?

827
01:12:47.503 --> 01:12:49.404
There you are.

828
01:12:49.404 --> 01:12:51.505
Activating targeting computer.

829
01:12:56.314 --> 01:12:57.511
Let's do this.

830
01:13:00.813 --> 01:13:01.812
Fire!

831
01:13:19.238 --> 01:13:20.930
Time to turn and burn.

832
01:13:39.786 --> 01:13:41.522
Oh!

833
01:13:41.522 --> 01:13:42.787
I'm hit!

834
01:13:42.787 --> 01:13:44.822
<i>Skye, are you okay?</i>

835
01:13:44.822 --> 01:13:47.462
I'm fine, but I'm gonna
have to ditch my jet.


836
01:13:58.310 --> 01:14:00.871
All right, space rocks,
what do you got?


837
01:14:20.695 --> 01:14:23.663
<i>There are meteors headed
directly for Adventure City.</i>


838
01:14:23.663 --> 01:14:28.668
<i>Evacuate the area immediately.
I repeat, evacuate the area!</i>


839
01:14:28.668 --> 01:14:32.540
Keep moving, everybody.
Only bring what's
absolutely necessary!


840
01:14:33.774 --> 01:14:34.872
Come on, Skye.

841
01:14:53.024 --> 01:14:55.365
That's all of them.
The sky is clear.


842
01:14:57.499 --> 01:14:58.995
No, it's not.

843
01:14:58.995 --> 01:15:01.602
Skye, there's
a huge meteor incoming.


844
01:15:03.738 --> 01:15:04.968
I don't see anything.

845
01:15:06.444 --> 01:15:07.575
Wait a second.

846
01:15:15.079 --> 01:15:16.078
Oh, no.

847
01:15:21.657 --> 01:15:24.053
Skye, you've got
to get out of there!


848
01:15:26.893 --> 01:15:30.224
I can't do that, Ryder.
I have to try.


849
01:15:30.224 --> 01:15:33.304
<i>Save yourself, Skye!
That meteor's too big!</i>


850
01:15:40.445 --> 01:15:41.741
No pup's too small.

851
01:16:07.362 --> 01:16:09.098
No pup's too small!

852
01:16:15.447 --> 01:16:16.974
No pup's too small!

853
01:16:29.692 --> 01:16:30.922
Skye!

854
01:16:52.748 --> 01:16:54.011
Skye!

855
01:16:54.376 --> 01:16:56.849
Skye!

856
01:16:58.457 --> 01:16:59.522
Skye!

857
01:17:19.544 --> 01:17:21.038
Wait. What's that?

858
01:17:32.216 --> 01:17:33.787
Whoa!

859
01:17:37.529 --> 01:17:39.155
You see that right there?

860
01:17:39.155 --> 01:17:40.596
That's why she's
my favorite pup.


861
01:17:42.732 --> 01:17:44.094
Yeah, Skye!

862
01:17:44.094 --> 01:17:45.832
- Whoo-hoo!
- Yeah!


863
01:17:45.832 --> 01:17:48.296
That was amazing.

864
01:17:49.266 --> 01:17:51.101
I'm so proud of you, Skye.

865
01:17:51.101 --> 01:17:53.202
That was the bravest thing
I've ever seen.


866
01:17:55.239 --> 01:17:58.845
I don't believe it.
She did it. Yeah!


867
01:18:01.982 --> 01:18:03.212
Whoo-hoo!

868
01:18:03.212 --> 01:18:05.445
Way to go,
PAW Patrol!


869
01:18:11.255 --> 01:18:14.289
Give it up for Skye
and the Mighty Pups!


870
01:18:32.276 --> 01:18:36.212
<i>We are the Mighty Pups,
defenders of Adventure City</i>


871
01:18:36.212 --> 01:18:39.182
<i>and guardians of all
that's good in the world.</i>


872
01:18:39.182 --> 01:18:41.151
<i>With these superpowers
comes a duty</i>


873
01:18:41.151 --> 01:18:44.627
<i>to protect all those
who need our help.</i>


874
01:18:44.627 --> 01:18:46.860
<i>Our promise is to always
do what's right</i>


875
01:18:46.860 --> 01:18:49.258
<i>and stop at nothing
to keep the world safe.</i>


876
01:18:50.129 --> 01:18:52.129
<i>Because even the smallest pup</i>

877
01:18:56.102 --> 01:18:57.838
<i>can make
the biggest difference.</i>


878
01:19:00.678 --> 01:19:02.579
No rescue's too big...

879
01:19:03.745 --> 01:19:05.109
No pup's too small.
