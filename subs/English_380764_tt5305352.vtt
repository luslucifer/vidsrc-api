She doesn't listen
to a single word I say.

She dropped out of college,

of responsibility.

said no to this movie,

152
00:14:07.805 --> 00:14:10.068
which means we have
to take action

and prove all
the producers wrong.

making a movie, Val.

Because you are Valentine.

You understand...

324
00:34:38.078 --> 00:34:39.861
there are a lot of bad memories

325
00:34:39.862 --> 00:34:41.777
in this house for all of us,
right?


326
00:34:43.736 --> 00:34:45.911
Dad died here.

327
00:34:45.912 --> 00:34:48.914
I still have
nightmares about it.


328
00:34:48.915 --> 00:34:50.699
Every night.

329
00:34:58.751 --> 00:35:00.492
Listen.

330
00:35:02.885 --> 00:35:06.148
Maybe by selling this house,

331
00:35:06.149 --> 00:35:08.500
we'll all get a chance
to start over.


332
00:35:12.547 --> 00:35:16.202
If we really sell this house,

333
00:35:16.203 --> 00:35:18.509
We won't just lose
the bad memories.


334
00:35:18.510 --> 00:35:20.120
We'll lose all of them!

the masked female vigilante


337
00:35:43.578 --> 00:35:45.927
known as Valentine,
who has been single-handedly


338
00:35:45.928 --> 00:35:49.148
apprehending bands of notorious
criminals all over Batavia City


339
00:35:49.149 --> 00:35:52.587
remains a mystery even to the
Batavia City Police Department.


340
00:35:54.937 --> 00:35:56.721
I think we did it.

341
00:35:56.722 --> 00:35:58.766
We have convinced them enough
to believe in Valentine.


342

Right. (LAUGHS)

343

gonna start the shoot?


344

It's only a matter of time.
Yeah.


345
00:36:10.126 --> 00:36:12.780
Speaking of which, um...

346
00:36:12.781 --> 00:36:15.217
Uh, give me a second.
All right.


347
00:36:15.218 --> 00:36:16.524

349
00:36:21.616 --> 00:36:23.575
I got you...

350
00:36:24.706 --> 00:36:26.926
some new gadgets.
Yay!


351
00:36:28.971 --> 00:36:30.450
Now, thanks to technology,

352
00:36:30.451 --> 00:36:32.626
you just stick it to your face
like this.


353
00:36:32.627 --> 00:36:36.195
I'm telling you, girl, these
gadgets will change your life.


354
00:36:36.196 --> 00:36:39.067
These aren't gadgets.
They're tools.


355
00:36:39.068 --> 00:36:40.461
Are you on your period?

356
00:36:42.507 --> 00:36:44.116
I thought it was
time to celebrate


357
00:36:44.117 --> 00:36:46.379
because of how far you've come.

358
00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:48.512
I just want to start
to shoot already.


359
00:36:48.513 --> 00:36:49.731
We can celebrate then.

360
00:36:52.517 --> 00:36:55.040
I think... I think
I'm gonna go rest.


361
00:36:55.041 --> 00:36:56.041
Okay.

362
00:37:04.050 --> 00:37:05.616
Look at that boy.

363
00:37:05.617 --> 00:37:07.923
Did you see that?
You hurt his feelings.


364
00:37:08.881 --> 00:37:10.925
I'm tired of waiting.

365
00:37:10.926 --> 00:37:12.536
And you think I'm not?

366
00:37:12.537 --> 00:37:14.451
But waiting's our only option.

367
00:37:14.452 --> 00:37:16.931
You just have to be patient
for a little bit longer.


368

but try to help you.

That poor man.

371
00:38:40.233 --> 00:38:41.973
Many look down on Valentine's

372
00:38:41.974 --> 00:38:44.149
vigilante methods of
crime-fighting.


373

succeeded in reducing

the infamous crime lord

376

Still, even to this day,

377
00:38:51.679 --> 00:38:54.115
police and civilians alike
are left to wonder,


378

who is this masked
young heroine?


379

Ever since Valentine first

380
00:38:59.644 --> 00:39:01.470
started her one-woman
war on crime,


381

reported feeling safer

383

Can you tell me how
you feel about Valentine?

385

aren't going to protect us.

01:21:03.687 --> 01:21:05.905
Umbra, you don't
have to do this.


648
01:21:05.906 --> 01:21:08.125
I have all the evidence here.

649
01:21:08.126 --> 01:21:10.040
You're right to be angry.

650
01:21:10.041 --> 01:21:12.087
But let me help you get justice.

651
01:21:22.097 --> 01:21:24.968
Looks like you're surrounded,
Umbra. On your knees.


652
01:21:24.969 --> 01:21:27.276
Take another step, and he dies.

653
01:21:40.811 --> 01:21:44.074
Or would you prefer
we make an arrangement?


654
01:21:44.075 --> 01:21:46.207
What's the matter, chief?
Don't have the guts?


655
01:21:46.208 --> 01:21:47.817
Don't you play games with me.

656
01:21:47.818 --> 01:21:49.645
Oh, I think
we're well past that.


657
01:21:49.646 --> 01:21:51.342
Then tell me your demands.

658
01:21:51.343 --> 01:21:54.302
There's only
one things that I want.


659
01:21:54.303 --> 01:21:57.392
It's you. I'll trade you

660
01:21:57.393 --> 01:21:59.785
for this royal guest.

661
01:21:59.786 --> 01:22:03.093
You want to take away
this city's symbol of order?


662
01:22:03.094 --> 01:22:05.269
If I comply
with a thug like you,


663
01:22:05.270 --> 01:22:08.229
it shows that our city
negotiates with terrorists.


664
01:22:08.230 --> 01:22:11.798
Oh, really?
You think you're so special?


665
01:22:13.539 --> 01:22:15.759
If you die here tonight,

666
01:22:17.152 --> 01:22:19.066
you'll be replaced
and forgotten.


667
01:22:20.546 --> 01:22:22.679
It's time for you
to make a choice.


668
01:22:45.180 --> 01:22:47.051
Tell your men to back off.

669
01:22:49.967 --> 01:22:52.622
Fall back! Everyone back!

670
01:22:53.623 --> 01:22:55.929
All units retreat!

671
01:23:02.284 --> 01:23:04.154
You want to know
the real reason


672
01:23:04.155 --> 01:23:07.419
why all of these horrible things
have happened in this city?


673
01:23:11.249 --> 01:23:12.815
Tell them the truth

674
01:23:12.816 --> 01:23:15.209
about that day in 2010.

675
01:23:15.210 --> 01:23:20.605
Explain why this city can
no longer trust the police.


676
01:23:20.606 --> 01:23:23.130
I want them to see
what a monster you are!


677
01:23:24.915 --> 01:23:26.699
Confess.

678
01:23:38.102 --> 01:23:39.711
SYAM: Five years ago,

679
01:23:39.712 --> 01:23:42.106
when I was
the District Chief...


680
01:23:44.543 --> 01:23:46.501
MAN: Does our friendship

681
01:23:46.502 --> 01:23:47.981
mean nothing to you?

682
01:23:51.768 --> 01:23:53.812
(SIGHS)

683
01:23:53.813 --> 01:23:57.207
I told you, Buma.
Don't worry about it.


684
01:23:57.208 --> 01:23:58.643
Don't worry about it?

685
01:23:58.644 --> 01:24:01.080
Syam, you sold
confiscated evidence!


686
01:24:01.081 --> 01:24:02.691
You committed a serious crime!

687
01:24:02.692 --> 01:24:05.302
Do you know what could
happen because of that?


688
01:24:05.303 --> 01:24:08.392
These weapons will just make
the crime rates worse again.


689
01:24:08.393 --> 01:24:10.307
This could endanger our wives,

690
01:24:10.308 --> 01:24:13.615
our children, our families,
the entire city!


691
01:24:13.616 --> 01:24:17.445
We are the police! Where
the hell is your conscience?


692
01:24:17.446 --> 01:24:20.840
Sooner or later,
someone is gonna find out!


693
01:24:22.233 --> 01:24:26.193
Buma, for old time's sake,

694
01:24:27.586 --> 01:24:29.152
just walk away from this.

695
01:24:29.153 --> 01:24:30.850
That's impossible.

696
01:24:32.939 --> 01:24:35.637
Buma, have you forgotten?

697
01:24:35.638 --> 01:24:38.292
The three of us were delinquents
who joined the police


698
01:24:38.293 --> 01:24:41.077
so we could control our destiny!

699
01:24:41.078 --> 01:24:45.081
We're the same.
How dare you try to lecture me?


700
01:24:45.082 --> 01:24:47.039
Never!

701
01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:48.781
I'm nothing like you.

703
01:25:26.297 --> 01:25:27.820
MAN: This is OP1, sir.

704
01:25:33.739 --> 01:25:35.524
LUKMAN: Umbra...

705
01:25:49.886 --> 01:25:51.366
Take care of Mom.

706
01:27:17.277 --> 01:27:21.064
Four, three, two, one.

707
01:27:24.110 --> 01:27:27.156
At this time, we have confirmed
the death of the criminal


708
01:27:27.157 --> 01:27:29.680
known as Shadow
from a police sniper's round.


709
01:27:29.681 --> 01:27:32.378
New evidence discovered
by police inspector Lukman


710
01:27:32.379 --> 01:27:36.078
has revealed Shadow's identity
to be Umbra Bumantara,


711
01:27:36.079 --> 01:27:39.037
the son of the late
Inspector General Bumantara.


712
01:27:39.038 --> 01:27:41.910
Five years ago, the death of
Inspector Bumantara


713
01:27:41.911 --> 01:27:44.869
was closely related to
an illegal weapons deal,


714
01:27:44.870 --> 01:27:47.481
that disadvantaged
the country at a total cost


715
01:27:47.482 --> 01:27:49.918
of nearly 250 billion rupiah.

716
01:27:49.919 --> 01:27:53.008
New evidence discovered
by Inspector Lukman, however,


717
01:27:53.009 --> 01:27:55.793
has revealed that the deal
was actually setup


718
01:27:55.794 --> 01:27:58.317
by Bumantara's colleagues
at that time.


719
01:27:58.318 --> 01:28:01.843
Commissioner General Syamsul
and General Bambang.


720
01:28:01.844 --> 01:28:04.410
They set this tragic
scandal in motion


721
01:28:04.411 --> 01:28:07.109
using Inspector Bumantara
as a scapegoat


722
01:28:07.110 --> 01:28:08.806
for the entire operation.

723
01:28:08.807 --> 01:28:11.548
Umbra, the man we now
know as Shadow,


724
01:28:11.549 --> 01:28:14.377
terrorized Batavia City
as his method to punish


725
01:28:14.378 --> 01:28:15.900
the very same police department

726
01:28:15.901 --> 01:28:17.685
that caused the death
of his father.


727
01:28:17.686 --> 01:28:19.948
It's difficult to
justify his actions,


728
01:28:19.949 --> 01:28:21.776
but we at Channel 11
understand...


729
01:28:21.777 --> 01:28:22.777
(GUNSHOT)

730
01:28:22.778 --> 01:28:25.301
MAN: Shadow,
the terror of Batavia City


731
01:28:25.302 --> 01:28:28.565
has cast a light upon the
despicable crime committed...


732
01:28:28.566 --> 01:28:30.567
WOMAN: ...Syamsul sacrificed himself,

733
01:28:30.568 --> 01:28:31.742
dying at Shadow's hand

734
01:28:31.743 --> 01:28:33.570
to save the royal prince's life

735
01:28:33.571 --> 01:28:35.790
and to return honor
to the police department.


736
01:28:35.791 --> 01:28:36.834
WOMAN 2: The people of Batavia

737
01:28:36.835 --> 01:28:38.140
have expressed their gratitude

738
01:28:38.141 --> 01:28:40.838
to the police,
especially Syamsul,


739
01:28:40.839 --> 01:28:42.797
for their actions
in protecting the city


740
01:28:42.798 --> 01:28:44.886
and fighting back against
the numerous crimes


741
01:28:44.887 --> 01:28:47.802
conducted by
Shadow's syndicate.


742
01:28:47.803 --> 01:28:49.891
Even though the city
mourns as one for the death of


743
01:28:49.892 --> 01:28:51.762
Commissioner General Syamsul,

744
01:28:51.763 --> 01:28:54.896
we know now that Bumantara was
set up by his own colleagues.


745
01:28:54.897 --> 01:28:56.506
Commissioner Syamsul...

746
01:28:56.507 --> 01:28:58.813
Commissioner Bumantara
was a victim.


747
01:28:58.814 --> 01:29:01.206
Today, he gets
his good name back.


748
01:29:01.207 --> 01:29:03.382
But what about the misery
that has come to the people


749
01:29:03.383 --> 01:29:05.863
of this city in the wake
of that tragedy?


750
01:29:05.864 --> 01:29:07.692
Inspector.

751
01:30:16.456 --> 01:30:18.807
SRI: This is not the end.

752
01:30:20.460 --> 01:30:22.332
Life has many trials.

753
01:30:23.986 --> 01:30:27.118
It's up to us to find
the strength within ourselves.


754
01:30:27.119 --> 01:30:29.382
The strength to overcome them.

755
01:30:31.254 --> 01:30:32.733
Even if it feels like

756
01:30:32.734 --> 01:30:35.692
everything around you
is falling apart,


757
01:30:35.693 --> 01:30:38.348
it does not mean
you have to fall apart too.


758
01:30:41.743 --> 01:30:43.482
It's true. You don't always

759
01:30:43.483 --> 01:30:46.311
get to choose what kind
of person you become.


760
01:30:46.312 --> 01:30:48.226
But sometimes,

761
01:30:48.227 --> 01:30:51.229
fate has its own plans
to make you even better


762
01:30:51.230 --> 01:30:54.016
than you ever thought possible.
