00:19:15.767 --> 00:19:17.806
- Jeff, this is Tony...
- Excuse me.
傑夫，這位是東尼
失陪


242
00:19:19.395 --> 00:19:21.519
Underneath it all, very simple.
表面如此，其實他很單純


243
00:19:21.606 --> 00:19:23.314
Isn't he wonderful?
他是不是很棒?


244
00:19:28.237 --> 00:19:31.073
Listen. Order me
a corned-beef sandwich, will you?
聽著，幫我叫一個牛肉三明治，好嗎?


245
00:19:31.157 --> 00:19:34.821
Lean, now, no fat, no gristle.
And a cream soda and a pickle.
瘦肉，不要肥的，
不要軟骨香草汽水和酸黃瓜


246
00:19:35.829 --> 00:19:38.745
- Mr. Cordova wants a...
- Stay right here. It's all right.
可多瓦先生要一個…
就在這裏等，沒關係


247
00:19:38.831 --> 00:19:41.239
That maniac. Honestly! Say, Hal?
說真的，真是瘋了嘿，哈爾?


248
00:19:41.334 --> 00:19:43.493
- Yes, Miss Marton.
- The maestro wants his...
是，莫頓小姐
大師要他的…


249
00:19:43.587 --> 00:19:46.336
I know. The corned beef.
It's in his dressing room already.
我知道，牛肉三明治已經送到他的更衣室了


250
00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:47.535
Hal, this is Mr. Hunter.
哈爾，這是杭特先生


251
00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:50.168
- This is Hal Benton, Jeff's manager.
- Nice to meet you.
這是哈爾班頓，傑夫的經理
很高興認識你


252
00:19:50.258 --> 00:19:52.049
- I'm a great admirer of yours.
- Thank you.
我非常崇拜你
謝謝你


253
00:19:52.135 --> 00:19:55.504
- When did you get in town?
- I got off the train a couple of hours ago.
你何時到紐約的?
我搭火車，兩小時前才到


254
00:19:55.597 --> 00:19:58.681
- Wasn't that curtain slower tonight?
- It was my fault. I'm sorry.
今晚的布幕是不是比較慢?
是我的錯，對不起


255
00:19:58.767 --> 00:20:02.550
No, don't change it. Keep it that way.
It's wonderful. Doubles the applause.
不，不用改，就這樣這樣很好，掌聲加倍


256
00:20:02.645 --> 00:20:04.601
- Jeff, this is Tony Hunter.
- How do you do?
傑夫，這是東尼杭特
你好


257
00:20:04.688 --> 00:20:08.389
Sorry, kids. Be with you soon as I get out
of this sackcloth and ashes...
對不起，等我把這一身衣服換下來


258
00:20:08.484 --> 00:20:12.268
Max, what happened to that amber spot?
It was way off.
麥克斯，聚光燈出了什麼問題?打歪了


259
00:20:12.363 --> 00:20:13.774
Must have more light on me there.
我身上得多打點光


260
00:20:13.864 --> 00:20:16.070
Don't let us keep it a secret
I'm in the show.
別把我當成黑影參與演出


261
00:20:16.157 --> 00:20:17.486
- Excuse me.
- Hello, sweetheart.
對不起
甜心


262
00:20:17.576 --> 00:20:19.319
- You look wonderful.
- Thank you.
- 你看起來棒極了。
- 謝謝你。


263
00:20:19.411 --> 00:20:23.325
Hal, call a full dialogue rehearsal, will you?
Friday, for the full company.
哈爾，要大家排練整個旁白?
好嗎?全部的人在星期五


264
00:20:23.414 --> 00:20:26.618
Sloppy diction. The original was in Greek,
but this is in English.
發音不標準，原著是希臘文但這是英文


265
00:20:26.709 --> 00:20:31.003
Don't let us keep it a secret it's in English.
I want to catch the matinee tomorrow...
不要把這是個英文版當成不能演借口
我明天要趕午場演出…


266
00:20:31.088 --> 00:20:33.841
<i>- of Man in a Mousetrap.
- Can't do. We got a drama lecture...</i>
《困在補鼠器的人》
不行，有一場戲劇演講


267
00:20:33.925 --> 00:20:35.633
Never mind. We'll work it out somehow.
沒關係，我們有辦法的


268
00:20:35.719 --> 00:20:37.840
Jeff, this is Tony Hunter.
傑夫，這是東尼杭特


269
00:20:37.928 --> 00:20:39.837
Yeah, I know. We just met.
對，我知道，我們才見過


270
00:20:41.765 --> 00:20:42.880
Mr. Hunter.
杭特先生


271
00:20:42.975 --> 00:20:44.931
- I beg your pardon.
- I'm glad to know you.
對不起
真高興見到你


272
00:20:45.018 --> 00:20:46.299
So happy to meet you.
見到你真好


273
00:20:46.395 --> 00:20:49.266
You have no idea
how delighted I am to see you.
你不知道跟你見面我有多高興


274
00:20:49.357 --> 00:20:51.348
- Delighted and thrilled.
- Thank you.
高興又興奮
謝謝


275
00:20:52.818 --> 00:20:55.188
We need our theatre greats right here.
我希望我們的劇團眾星雲集


276
00:20:55.277 --> 00:20:58.812
So when Lily and Lester said they were
doing a show with Tony Hunter...
所以當莉莉和李斯特說
他們正和東尼杭特籌備一齣戲時


277
00:20:58.905 --> 00:21:00.815
that's all I had to know.
我什麼都不再多問


278
00:21:00.991 --> 00:21:04.657
I'm dropping every other project,
and there are plenty, believe me.
我放棄了很多劇本相信我，非常多


279
00:21:05.497 --> 00:21:09.909
That's wonderful, Mr. Cordova,
but all this... The classics...
太好了，可多瓦先生但是這整個古典劇…


280
00:21:10.542 --> 00:21:14.622
- Do you really want to do a musical?
- Musical, musical!
你真的要拍音樂劇?
音樂劇，音樂劇!


281
00:21:14.713 --> 00:21:18.628
I'm sick of these artificial barriers
between the musical and the drama.
我受夠了界於音樂劇和戲劇間的虛偽屏障


282
00:21:18.968 --> 00:21:22.632
In my mind, there is no difference
between the magic rhythms...
在我心裏，永恆的莎士比亞創造的奇妙韻律…


283
00:21:22.721 --> 00:21:26.506
of Bill Shakespeare's immortal verse
and the magic rhythms...
和不朽的比爾羅賓森舞出的神奇節奏…


284
00:21:26.601 --> 00:21:29.005
of Bill Robinson's immortal feet.
是一樣的


285
00:21:29.684 --> 00:21:32.306
Hal, write that down.
I'll use it at Princeton.
哈爾，記下來，我要用在普林斯頓大學的演說


286
00:21:32.396 --> 00:21:34.305
It's already down. You used it last week.
已經寫下來了，你上禮拜用過


287
00:21:34.398 --> 00:21:37.066
I tell you, if it moves you,
if it stimulates you...
我告訴你，能讓你感動的能刺激你的…


288
00:21:37.150 --> 00:21:39.309
if it entertains you, it's theatre.
能娛樂你的，就是劇場


289
00:21:39.445 --> 00:21:42.730
When the right combination gets together
and it spells theatre...
當所有對的東西集合在一起形成劇場…


290
00:21:42.822 --> 00:21:46.025
I got to be right in there up to my armpits.
我非浸淫於其中


291
00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:48.159
That's higher than usual.
簡直是無與能比的興奮


292
00:21:48.244 --> 00:21:50.701
Now, that's what I wanted
Tony to hear you say.
我就是要東尼聽你親口說


293
00:21:50.789 --> 00:21:55.250
I tried to tell him how you feel, but I knew
that you could say it so beautifully.
我試著告訴他你的感覺但是我知道你能說得非常精采


294
00:21:55.336 --> 00:21:57.743
Lily, you splendid animal.
莉莉，你這個造物者的佳作


295
00:21:57.921 --> 00:22:00.837
Take your hands off my wife
and let's get down to business.
別碰我太太，我們談正事吧


296
00:22:00.922 --> 00:22:04.042
Now I have here a script.
It's great. It's ready to roll.
我這裏有一個很棒的劇本已經完成了


297
00:22:04.134 --> 00:22:07.717
Jeff, I want you to take this home.
I want you to read it tonight...
傑夫，我要你今晚帶回家讀


298
00:22:07.804 --> 00:22:10.970
But before I do,
give me a rough idea of the plot.
先把大概的情節告訴我


299
00:22:11.182 --> 00:22:13.720
- Now?
- Throw it at me for a quick impression.
現在?
大致先給我一個印象


300
00:22:13.810 --> 00:22:15.803
- I'm dying to hear it.
- You tell it, Lester.
我迫不急待想聽
李斯特，你說


301
00:22:15.895 --> 00:22:18.136
- You do it so much better.
- Lester, honestly.
你說得精采多了
李斯特，拜託


302
00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:20.721
- Please, Lily, tell them.
- Lester, honestly.
莉莉，拜託，告訴他們
李斯特，拜託


303
00:22:21.567 --> 00:22:25.646
With Tony in mind, we naturally
visualize a light and intimate show.
因為是為東尼寫的
我們想像這是一齣輕快的愛情戲


304
00:22:25.737 --> 00:22:29.736
We want to give him a chance to play
a charming guy, with just enough plot...
我們鋪陳的情節要他飾演一個
魅力十足的帥哥…


305
00:22:29.826 --> 00:22:32.743
to make him do lots
of gay and varied numbers.
剛好能讓他表現很多首愉快的舞曲


306
00:22:33.162 --> 00:22:36.577
He's a writer and illustrator
of children's books...
他是個童書作家兼插畫家


307
00:22:36.665 --> 00:22:38.242
but to get in the real dough...
但是為了賺錢


308
00:22:38.333 --> 00:22:41.417
on the side,
he writes lurid murder mysteries...
他也兼寫駭人聽聞的謀殺懸疑小說


309
00:22:41.502 --> 00:22:43.828
full of violence and buckets of blood.
充滿暴力和血腥


310
00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:47.341
The success of these
makes him feel he's sort of...
他的小說很賣座但是他覺得…


311
00:22:47.425 --> 00:22:50.130
sold his soul to the Devil,
but he keeps on doing it.
把靈魂賣給魔鬼，
好讓他一直做下去。


312
00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:53.552
There's lots of comedy implications
with his friends, played by us.
他和朋友之間蘊藏很多喜劇
我們飾演他的朋友


313
00:22:53.639 --> 00:22:56.391
- And with his girl.
-I love this. Terrific possibilities.
和他的女朋友
我愛死了，很可能賣座


314
00:22:56.475 --> 00:22:58.682
And some of the best numbers
we've ever written!
有一些舞曲是我們寫過最好的


315
00:22:58.769 --> 00:23:03.063
Children's playground, a reform school,

316
00:23:03.148 --> 00:23:06.399
- And a number about a murder mystery!
- You two are the end.
還有一首舞曲是有關謀殺的
你們兩個太棒了


317
00:23:06.652 --> 00:23:10.233
- Tony, I'm so glad!
- Some of the best lines we've written.
東尼，我好高興!
有些是我們寫過最好的對白


318
00:23:11.614 --> 00:23:13.606
What do you think, Jeff?
傑夫，你的看法如何?


319
00:23:21.709 --> 00:23:23.617
Kids, you're geniuses.
年輕人，你們是天才


320
00:23:23.752 --> 00:23:26.668
The whole thing
is a brilliantly imaginative idea.
整個想法真是充滿想像力


321
00:23:26.754 --> 00:23:28.165
Why, Jeff!
為什麼，傑夫！


322
00:23:28.255 --> 00:23:31.873
You've hit on something
that's not only great as a musical...
你們想出來的不只是偉大的音樂劇


323
00:23:31.967 --> 00:23:34.803
but valid in terms of today, of modern life.
而且符合當今社會


324
00:23:34.887 --> 00:23:36.714
Jeff, I'm so glad!
傑夫，我真高興!


325
00:23:36.806 --> 00:23:40.471
Of course, these modern thrillers,
he's got to keep turning them out.
當然，他要繼續寫這些當代驚恐小說


326
00:23:40.559 --> 00:23:42.550
They make him fame, money. He's caught.
這些小說給他名利，他被困住了


327
00:23:42.643 --> 00:23:44.267
It's a funny situation.
是個好笑的情況


328
00:23:44.353 --> 00:23:48.018
Of course! It's brilliant,
contemporary, perceptive.
當然!很精采、很現代化、很有感覺


329
00:23:48.274 --> 00:23:51.394
<i>This story's a modern version of Faust.</i>
這是《浮士德》的現代版


330
00:23:52.986 --> 00:23:55.193
<i>- Faust?
- You're kidding, Jeff.</i>
《浮士德》?
傑夫，你開玩笑吧


331
00:23:56.281 --> 00:23:59.815
I guess I didn't tell it right.
I didn't bring out the point.
我想我說得不好我沒說出重點


332
00:23:59.909 --> 00:24:04.204
But you did bring out the point admirably.
You used the phrase:
但是你的確把重點說得很精采
你用這句話…


333
00:24:04.290 --> 00:24:06.662
"He sells his soul to the Devil."
「他出賣靈魂給魔鬼」


334
00:24:07.042 --> 00:24:10.209
Now, that's the line you have to follow
straight through.
這句話要從頭貫穿到尾


335
00:24:10.462 --> 00:24:13.133
Just like Faust,
this man is tempted by the Devil...
就像浮士德這個人受魔鬼誘惑


336
00:24:13.216 --> 00:24:17.626
and his compromise, his sell-out,
must end in eternal damnation.
他妥協、他背叛自己
要在永恆的毀滅中結束


337
00:24:18.302 --> 00:24:20.211
That'll leave them laughing.
那樣會讓觀眾大笑


338
00:24:20.304 --> 00:24:24.348
Kids, you've got a choice here
between a nice little musical comedy...
你們要一齣不錯的小型音樂喜劇


339
00:24:24.432 --> 00:24:27.269
and a modern musical morality play...
還是要一齣現代化的道德劇


340
00:24:27.353 --> 00:24:29.724
with meaning and stature!
充滿意義和境界


341
00:24:30.439 --> 00:24:34.187
<i>- But we don't want to write Faust.
- You're taking me too literally.</i>
但是我們不想寫《浮士德》
你們把我想得太嚴肅了


342
00:24:34.275 --> 00:24:36.647
I want to do your story. I love it!
我要你們的故事，我愛死了!


343
00:24:36.985 --> 00:24:39.656
But I want to angle it
to bring out the analogy...
但是我要加入一個觀點，帶出


344
00:24:39.739 --> 00:24:42.444
<i>between the Faust legend
and this man's story.</i>
《浮士德》傳奇和這位帥哥之間的類比


345
00:24:43.035 --> 00:24:46.734
Won't this make it heavy?
Is this a box-office idea?
這樣整齣戲不會變得很沉重嗎?
這是票房考慮嗎?


346
00:24:46.829 --> 00:24:48.240
<i>Is Faust box-office?</i>
《浮士德》有票房嗎?


347
00:24:48.331 --> 00:24:51.865
<i>Listen, Faust by Christopher Marlowe,
Faust by Goethe, Faust by Gounod...</i>
聽著，克裏斯多佛馬羅果斯、古諾、赫克特波裏茲


348
00:24:51.959 --> 00:24:53.038
<i>Faust by Hector Berlioz.</i>
都拍過《浮士德》


349
00:24:53.127 --> 00:24:57.125
I tell you, anyone who's touched this
legend has turned it into a gold mine.
我告訴你，碰觸這個傳奇人物就會賺大錢


350
00:24:57.214 --> 00:24:58.838
It's got to be a smash.
定會成功的


351
00:24:59.925 --> 00:25:02.760
It could still have all the fun in it,
couldn't it?
還是可以很有趣，對不對?


352
00:25:02.844 --> 00:25:06.711
- Yeah, and some stature thrown in.
- Now, kids, I'm happy about this.
對，加入一些意境
我很高興


353
00:25:07.015 --> 00:25:09.553
- Really happy.
- So are we, Jeff.
真的
傑夫，我們也是


354
00:25:09.642 --> 00:25:11.101
This publisher you mentioned...
你說的那個出版商


355
00:25:11.186 --> 00:25:14.055
obviously, he could be
the counterpart of the Devil.
很顯然他就是魔鬼


356
00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:20.899
Evil personified!

This is just your meat.

你是最棒的，而且我們都知道

Say, that sounds interesting.
聽起來很有趣


480

I've never been so excited
about a project in my life.
我一生中還不曾為一齣戲這麼興奮過

a great score by the Martons.
有東尼杭特、我自己音樂是莫頓夫婦寫的

to churn already.
太棒了，我的腦筋開始動個不停

for a wonderful singer for the girl.
好，我們現在要找一個很棒的歌手
來演這個女士角

Singer? Jeff, don't you think we ought
to stress the dancing in that role?
歌手?傑夫，你不覺得我們該強調這個角色的舞技?


485
00:33:11.429 --> 00:33:12.673
No, Paul.
不，保羅

This girl has to be a virtuoso performer,
with fire, charm, beauty...
這個女士角一定要有大師級
演得出熱情、迷人、美麗…


487
00:33:17.518 --> 00:33:21.598
a great lady with a gamine quality.
You know no dancer can give you that.
還帶點調皮你知道
沒有舞者具備這樣的特質


488
00:33:21.688 --> 00:33:25.733
Wait. Of course I wouldn't let her do it,
but Gabrielle has all that and more.
等等，當然我不會讓蓋布莉亞參與
但這些特質她都有


489

Gabrielle? Paul, I feel a little embarrassed.
蓋布莉亞? 保羅，我覺得不太好意思


490
00:33:29.155 --> 00:33:32.071
I think she's charming,
within her limitations. Charming.
她很迷人，但並非全能，迷人而已


491
00:33:32.157 --> 00:33:33.899
She's a great artist, and you know it.
她很棒，你很清楚


492
00:33:33.991 --> 00:33:37.491
- Sorry. I know how fond of her you are.
- That has nothing to do with it!
對不起，我知道你非常喜歡她
這跟那個無關!


493
00:33:37.578 --> 00:33:39.952
She can be one of the greatest
stars in the theatre.
她可以成為劇場最閃亮的明星

Everybody's been trying to get her.
大家都想要她


495
00:33:41.624 --> 00:33:43.866
For the right vehicle,
something light and fluffy.
只要劇本對了輕鬆又沒有很多對白


496
00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:45.620
Light and fluffy? Now, see here, Jeff.
輕鬆又沒有很多對白?傑夫


497
00:33:45.712 --> 00:33:49.162
I'm not gonna do this show
unless Gabrielle Gerard plays that part!
除非蓋布莉亞傑若參與這齣戲
否則我不願插手!


498
00:33:49.381 --> 00:33:53.082
Now, Paul, this throws a little
monkey wrench into things, doesn't it?
保羅，這樣很難再談下去，不是嗎?


499
00:33:53.177 --> 00:33:56.131
Never mind.
You and I will work together sometime...
無所謂，我們會有機會合作


500
00:33:56.221 --> 00:33:59.472
Wait. At least do this. You come
and see her in the ballet tomorrow.
等等，這樣好了你明天來看她跳芭蕾舞


501
00:33:59.558 --> 00:34:02.048
- Bring Hunter, bring the Martons.
- No. Impossible.
把杭特和莫頓夫婦一起帶來
不，不可能

But I'll gladly send the Martons.
我有演出，但我很樂意派莫頓夫婦過去

00:34:04.854 --> 00:34:08.389
We can get together afterwards and talk.
Mind you, I'm promising nothing.
散場後我們可以聚在一起聊聊
提醒你，我不敢保證

00:34:08.483 --> 00:34:10.274
Good night, sweetie.

哈爾還是讓那篇報導上報吧

you he's casting Tallulah...
還有麥克，如果可多瓦先生

我告訴你，我知道她很傑出
所以我才擔心

這個叫傑若的女演員不只是她的舞蹈

轉過去，比比看你看?
不是剛剛好?

聽著，蓋布莉亞傑若就算光腳
也只有9O公分

and you can stop worrying about her.
放輕鬆，我幫你倒杯飲料
你不要再擔心她的事

他鼓動雙翅，邪惡的雙眼冷冷地笑

in this show.
我知道東尼杭特
不希望我參與這齣戲

after the performance?

He knew he was going to meet you here.

我只是個芭蕾舞者…
你是當紅的首席芭蕾舞者

He's a famous movie and stage actor.
他為什麼找我?
他是知名的電影明星和舞台劇演員

by now.

跟他跳舞
就像跟格蘭特將軍的雕像跳舞一樣

你知道這是可多瓦的戲
對你是很重要的一步

I'm going to do the choreography,
so there's nothing for you to worry about.
編舞由我負責，所以你不用擔心


579
00:40:03.817 --> 00:40:06.688
But I still think he doesn't want me
in the show.
但是找還是覺得他不會要我


580

- Maybe this is it.
你鼻子出油了

Lester, what have we got ourselves into?
李斯特，事情怎麼會這樣?


586
00:40:42.103 --> 00:40:45.555
The story he's telling them has nothing
to do with the story we wrote.
他說的故事跟我們寫的毫無關係


587
00:40:45.649 --> 00:40:48.104
This will mean months of rewriting.

He expects us to go into rehearsal

a soft-shoe shuffle.
還有偶爾不穿踢踏舞鞋還能跳踢踏舞


620
00:42:39.464 --> 00:42:41.042
Nothing balletic, of course.

你不熱衷芭蕾舞，是不是?

before you were born.
對，我看芭蕾舞表演時你還沒出生

I'm sorry.
現在看不到這樣的舞技了，對不起

to class me with Pavlova.
沒關係，我不期望你把我

In fact, if she were around...

to dance with you.

628
00:42:58.357 --> 00:43:00.432
You'd probably insist on an audition first.
你說不定要她先試鏡


629
00:43:00.524 --> 00:43:03.276
I sure would.
I'd audition my own grandmother.
我一定會，就算我祖母我都要她試鏡

Then why don't you audition mine?
She'd be just about right for you.
那你為什麼不找我祖母試鏡?
她跟你說不定最速配

- No, you're not.

保羅，我要走了
親愛的，怎麼啦?

He's impossible.
我無法和這個人共事，

我有個比較好的點子


713
00:49:08.331 --> 00:49:10.618
You hold your position right here,
and Jimmy...
你在這裏站好，
然後吉米


714
00:49:10.706 --> 00:49:14.122
suppose you pick up Gaby like that,
and put her down...
應該像這樣抱起蓋比
然後把她放下來…


715
00:49:14.210 --> 00:49:16.368
right here next to Tony?
Now you see, Tony...
就在東尼身邊?
現在東尼你看


716
00:49:16.461 --> 00:49:18.870
I'd like to practice it with her
two or three times.

I think I could handle it.

Do you mind if he tries it with Barbara?
讓他和芭芭拉練習好嗎?


719
00:49:22.010 --> 00:49:23.918
These are new toeshoes.
They're killing me.
這些是新鞋，磨得我腳好痛

好，你去休息，
芭芭拉，來，試試看


721
00:49:26.721 --> 00:49:28.844
I think this is what's throwing you off.
我想這就是你出問題的地方

If you hold your balance so, like this,
then grab her here by the...
如果你的身體能這樣保持平衡

Paul, I think we're making a mistake here.

我想這場戲對東尼是個浪費

The damnation scene.
這個之後就是第一幕的結尾
那場毀滅的戲


726
00:49:44.030 --> 00:49:46.153
I don't want to dissipate
his impact in that.
我不想分散他在那場戲的份量


727
00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:50.534
Now, why not let him exit into the house
and watch it from his balcony?
何不讓他進屋子裏
然後從陽台往下看?


728
00:49:50.620 --> 00:49:52.162
- How'd that be?
- Wonderful idea.
那樣好嗎
好極了


729
00:49:52.247 --> 00:49:54.737
See what that would do?
Save your sock for the finale.
那樣如何?
把你的戲份都集中在結尾


730
00:49:54.832 --> 00:49:56.030
Much better that way.
那樣比較好


731
00:49:56.125 --> 00:49:58.415
Let's go back
to the beginning positions. Gaby.
蓋比，我們從頭再來

and the girls, yes.
來，男生到這裏，
還有女生，對

Not too close.

- No!

Let's not try it this way or any other way.
我們不要再試了

three weeks of these lovely rehearsals...
我受夠了，我排演

738
00:50:15.852 --> 00:50:19.351
three weeks of Chinese torture.
I don't know what you're trying to do...
受了3個星期的酷刑
我不知道除了讓我像個


739
00:50:19.438 --> 00:50:22.142
except make me look like a complete fool.
A clumsy idiot.

I've taken everything.
受了3個星期的酷刑

我看到自己戲份被改變
每天都刪掉我的舞曲…

think of the good of the show.
盡量配合，
為這齣戲著想


744
00:50:33.285 --> 00:50:35.242
Let's get this straight:

this little ballerina's snide insinuations...
現在這個小芭蕾舞者
惡意諷刺我不會跳舞．

that I am a no-talent hoofer.
我可嚥不下這口氯

我受夠了她優越的虛偽笑容
我受夠她了

I'm a dime-a-dozen ballet dancer.
你以為我
不過是個跳芭蕾舞的

No.

a nervous wreck and no show is worth it.
這整件事讓我精神崩潰

in a million years.

你誤會我了，

00:55:59.425 --> 00:56:02.510
but yet we're supposed
to dance together, work together.
但我們卻要一起跳舞，一起合作


832
00:56:02.595 --> 00:56:04.254
No one consulted us...
沒有人問過我們的意見


833
00:56:04.346 --> 00:56:07.513
but we're the only things that matter
in this whole thing.
但這整件事
少不了的是我們兩個


834
00:56:07.850 --> 00:56:11.183
Not those geniuses out there,
telling us what to do.
而不是那些告訴我們
該怎麼做的天才


835
00:56:11.686 --> 00:56:15.186
You're right.
We have to do the performing.
你是對的，
表演的人是我們


836
00:56:15.732 --> 00:56:18.269
We're the ones
that have to get up on that stage...
是我們
要站在舞台土


837
00:56:18.359 --> 00:56:22.773
- and make idiots out of ourselves.
- Tony, is that what's going to happen?
把自己弄得像個白癡
東尼，事情會變成那樣嗎?


838
00:56:22.948 --> 00:56:26.032
No. Of course not.
Things are going to be fine.
不，當然不會，
一切都會很順利


839
00:56:26.117 --> 00:56:29.651
I have a feeling that everything
is going to be much better from now on.
我覺得從現在起
一切會更順利


840
00:56:29.745 --> 00:56:31.489
Yes, I know, but...

Can you and I really dance together?

I don't know.

843

Let's find out.

Stork? Waldorf?
史托克?沃朵夫?


847

No. I'm not dressed.
I just came from rehearsal.
不，我沒有好好打扮
我排演完直接過來


848
00:57:00.357 --> 00:57:03.193
- I can't go to any of those places.
- You look fine to me.
那些地方我都不能去
我覺得你看起來很好


849
00:57:03.277 --> 00:57:05.519

- Thank you.
不用了，謝謝
謝謝

And isn't that called grass?

And, look, there's the sky.
而且，你看，還有的天空。


855
00:57:36.266 --> 00:57:37.807
This has all been here...
當我們被困在


856
00:57:37.891 --> 00:57:41.393
the whole time we have been
shut up in our little sweatbox of the arts.
藝術的小圈圈時，它們都在這裏

on those benches? People.

你相信嗎?他們甚至不在乎


861
00:57:50.737 --> 00:57:54.071
whether we have a damnation scene
in our show or not.
我們有沒有演毀滅那場戲


862

You can't get it into the elevators.
這個進不了升降梯

這邊這樣，和結尾不合

in the theatre.
這些佈景塞不進這個戲院

好，李斯特，給她

這樣聽起來會很亂
我最好為轉場加點和弦


885
01:03:41.444 --> 01:03:44.729

Sublime, time, dime, slime...

《比你還可愛》裏聽不到東尼的聲音
