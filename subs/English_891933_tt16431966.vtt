- [Garrett] What?

27
00:04:23.637 --> 00:04:25.273
- [Sean] I need um, this cable.

28
00:04:25.405 --> 00:04:30.177
It's an HDMI PGA, and
it's an adapter, and I-


29
00:04:30.311 --> 00:04:32.079
- [Garrett] I don't have it.

30
00:04:32.213 --> 00:04:33.214
- [Sean] Okay.

31
00:04:33.347 --> 00:04:34.514
I'll, I'll just ask Doug.

32
00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:38.152
- [Garrett] Wait, I think
I need one too, if...


33
00:04:38.286 --> 00:04:39.387
- What? You have two.

34
00:04:39.519 --> 00:04:41.255
- Well, I just want one.

35
00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:42.390
A cable.

36
00:04:42.522 --> 00:04:44.792
- Okay, um...

37
00:04:44.926 --> 00:04:45.793
- Doug?

38
00:04:46.559 --> 00:04:47.427
- [Sean] Is he here?

39
00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.561
- [Garrett] Yeah.

40
00:04:48.696 --> 00:04:49.297
(toilet flushing in distance)

41
00:04:49.429 --> 00:04:50.430
Hey.

42
00:04:50.563 --> 00:04:51.498
Yeah, let's go get coffee.

43
00:04:52.266 --> 00:04:53.067
Come on, what about Rich?

44
00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.035
I don't care.

45
00:04:54.168 --> 00:04:56.569
(flush echoing)

46
00:04:56.704 --> 00:04:58.039
That was the main plug.

47
00:04:58.172 --> 00:04:59.439
- [Emma] Will you
see the glaciers?


48
00:04:59.572 --> 00:05:01.108
You can drink the melting water

49
00:05:01.242 --> 00:05:02.710
- [Carol] Really?

50
00:05:02.843 --> 00:05:04.577
- [Emma] It is the cleanest
water in the world.


51
00:05:04.712 --> 00:05:06.347
- That better not be what
they mean by open bar.


52
00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:07.447
- You are so bad.

53
00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:08.581
- I know.

54
00:05:08.716 --> 00:05:09.582
- Will you post pictures?

55
00:05:09.717 --> 00:05:10.583
- Oh, yeah, #nofilter.

56
00:05:10.718 --> 00:05:11.919
- Morning, Garrett.

57
00:05:12.053 --> 00:05:12.920
- Morning.

58
00:05:13.054 --> 00:05:14.521
- Good morning.

59
00:05:14.655 --> 00:05:16.057
(mouse clicking)

60
00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:17.058

61
00:05:17.992 --> 00:05:18.859
Morning.

62
00:05:23.764 --> 00:05:25.733
- [Doug] See this
cruise ship out here?


63
00:05:28.235 --> 00:05:29.103
- Out here?

64
00:05:31.405 --> 00:05:33.040
Yes, I see that ship.

65
00:05:33.174 --> 00:05:34.141
It's very large.

66
00:05:35.376 --> 00:05:37.111
- Any idea how long
that's gonna be there?


67
00:05:37.244 --> 00:05:38.813
- No.

68
00:05:38.946 --> 00:05:41.983
I know it's been there for
at least the whole morning.


69
00:05:42.116 --> 00:05:44.819
- [Doug] Yeah, it was there
this morning when we got in.


70
00:05:44.952 --> 00:05:49.190
You know, I've been
doing this months now.


71
00:05:49.323 --> 00:05:50.557
- Yeah, yeah.

72
00:05:50.691 --> 00:05:52.126
No, they, they
come over and they,


73
00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.363
they sort of park there for,
they have an extended parking.


74
00:05:55.495 --> 00:05:57.965
- Well, I don't know why they
have to leave the ship there


75
00:05:58.099 --> 00:06:02.003
and just, you know, it'd be
nice if they could just stop


76
00:06:02.136 --> 00:06:03.871
and then keep
going or something.


77
00:06:04.005 --> 00:06:04.672
- Yeah.

78
00:06:04.805 --> 00:06:05.740
- The people come off.

79
00:06:06.707 --> 00:06:08.109
Can't see the mountains anymore.

80
00:06:08.242 --> 00:06:10.211
(crane beeping)

81
00:06:10.344 --> 00:06:11.212
- [Sean] It's true.

82
00:06:11.345 --> 00:06:12.179
It is a very large ship.

83
00:06:13.014 --> 00:06:14.547
It is kind of (mumbling).

84
00:06:15.983 --> 00:06:17.651
- [Doug] Yeah, it is.

85
00:06:17.785 --> 00:06:19.519
- [Sean] I mean, I
haven't seen anyone go on.


86
00:06:19.653 --> 00:06:23.157
- [Doug] I like boats,
of course, but that
there (mumbling).


87
00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:28.696
(Sean and Doug continue
conversing quietly)


88
00:06:32.366 --> 00:06:34.235
- [Doug] Well, what
I wanna know is


89
00:06:34.368 --> 00:06:39.707
who's making the decision to
allow this to just stay there.


90
00:06:41.108 --> 00:06:45.212
I think they, they (speech
drowned out by music)


91
00:06:45.346 --> 00:06:48.949
(disembodied voices echo)

92
00:06:51.986 --> 00:06:55.656
(crane strap straining)

93
00:07:00.995 --> 00:07:02.897
- [Isobel] Hey, Fran.

94
00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:03.931
- Sorry.

95
00:07:04.065 --> 00:07:05.366
- Sorry, I, I scared you.

96
00:07:05.499 --> 00:07:06.467
I'm sneaking up on people.

97
00:07:06.599 --> 00:07:08.135
Oogah booga. (laughing)

98
00:07:08.269 --> 00:07:10.871
Um, could you, for Carol's
last day tomorrow, sign that?


99
00:07:11.005 --> 00:07:14.909
We're tryin' to keep it a
surprise, so keep quiet.


100
00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:18.546
There'll be a big
reveal, and yeah,


101
00:07:18.679 --> 00:07:19.880
so thank you.

102
00:07:20.014 --> 00:07:21.982
Oh, moved your desk a little.

103
00:07:22.116 --> 00:07:22.950
That's okay.

104
00:07:23.084 --> 00:07:24.452
All right.

105
00:07:24.584 --> 00:07:27.254
(pen clicking)

106
00:07:34.428 --> 00:07:37.098
(mug thumping)

107
00:07:40.134 --> 00:07:42.770
- Breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

108
00:07:42.903 --> 00:07:44.205
(Emma laughing)

109
00:07:44.338 --> 00:07:45.773
(Carol sputtering)

110
00:07:45.906 --> 00:07:48.175
- [Sophie] I think
congratulations is fine.


111
00:07:48.309 --> 00:07:50.144
- [Garrett] I'd rather
be like the cool signer.


112
00:07:50.277 --> 00:07:52.546
- [Sophie] I know,
but you're already-


113
00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:53.981
- Carol?

114
00:07:54.115 --> 00:07:54.648
- Yeah.

115
00:07:54.782 --> 00:07:55.516
Hi.

116
00:07:55.649 --> 00:07:57.017
- Say, um...

117
00:07:57.151 --> 00:07:58.786
- This is what happens
with me with computers.


118
00:07:58.919 --> 00:08:01.088
I can't, it won't delete.

119
00:08:01.222 --> 00:08:02.089
See?

120
00:08:02.223 --> 00:08:03.991
- [Sophie] Let's
do (indistinct).


121
00:08:04.125 --> 00:08:05.960
- [Sean] No, no, um, we have
to follow up with the estate.


122
00:08:06.093 --> 00:08:07.862
- [Sophie] Okay, okay.

123
00:08:07.995 --> 00:08:10.898
(Sophie and Sean
conversing quietly)


124
00:08:11.031 --> 00:08:12.333
I can keep it in my desk.

125
00:08:12.466 --> 00:08:14.468
- [Rich] I don't know
if I need a battery.


126
00:08:14.602 --> 00:08:17.304
- [Sean] You should
actually have more folders.


127
00:08:17.438 --> 00:08:18.305
- [Sophie] Folders?

128
00:08:18.439 --> 00:08:19.573
I'll find the folder.

129
00:08:19.707 --> 00:08:21.041
Which folder is it under?

130
00:08:21.175 --> 00:08:23.410
- [Sean] I mean, you
should create a folder.


131
00:08:23.544 --> 00:08:24.812
- [Doug] There you go.

132
00:08:24.945 --> 00:08:25.946
- [Sophie] Oh, I'll
create a folder.


133
00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:27.081
- [Sean] If anyone is deceased.

134
00:08:27.214 --> 00:08:31.252
(employees conversing quietly)

135
00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:34.655

(doors slamming)

140
00:09:03.284 --> 00:09:03.951
- Okay?

141
00:09:04.084 --> 00:09:05.252
Hey, no, no, no, no, no.

142
00:09:05.386 --> 00:09:06.987
I said in the house.

143
00:09:07.821 --> 00:09:08.889
Girls.

144
00:09:10.491 --> 00:09:12.026
I need you to go into the house,

145
00:09:12.159 --> 00:09:14.295
help me with these groceries
(groceries thudding).

00:12:36.563 --> 00:12:39.633
(toothbrush buzzing)

170
00:12:47.776 --> 00:12:51.912
(toothbrush continues buzzing)

171
00:12:58.853 --> 00:13:01.922
(sheets rustling)

172
00:13:11.699 --> 00:13:14.501
(motor rumbling)

173
00:13:19.239 --> 00:13:22.176
(birds calling)

174
00:13:28.148 --> 00:13:29.383
- How ya doin', Fran?

175
00:13:31.452 --> 00:13:32.319
- Not bad.

176
00:13:33.721 --> 00:13:37.659
- Oh, Fran, I won't be
needing any of this anymore.


177
00:13:37.792 --> 00:13:39.960
You wanna stapler?

178
00:13:40.093 --> 00:13:43.898
Or, I dunno, how
'bout a calculator


179
00:13:44.031 --> 00:13:46.200
I probably bought in '87?

180
00:13:46.333 --> 00:13:48.035
Still works great, though.

181
00:13:49.236 --> 00:13:51.104
- Is the stapler up for grabs?

182
00:13:51.806 --> 00:13:52.973
- Ah, all yours.

183
00:13:53.106 --> 00:13:53.842
- Thanks.

184
00:13:53.974 --> 00:13:54.709
- Mm hm.

185
00:13:54.843 --> 00:13:55.576
You want this?

186
00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:56.443
- No.

187
00:13:56.577 --> 00:13:57.444
- No?

188
00:13:58.612 --> 00:13:59.546
- How about this
three-hole punch?


189
00:13:59.681 --> 00:14:00.581
- Take it away.

190
00:14:00.715 --> 00:14:01.649
You're welcome.

191
00:14:02.951 --> 00:14:03.818
Anything else?

192
00:14:03.952 --> 00:14:06.186
- Uh, no, thanks.

193
00:14:18.098 --> 00:14:19.099
- [Garrett] You're
gonna miss him.


194
00:14:19.233 --> 00:14:21.502
- I know, I know, you're right.

195
00:14:21.635 --> 00:14:22.569
I'm a bitch.

196
00:14:22.704 --> 00:14:23.570
- [Garrett] Ha.

197
00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:31.345
- I'm going on a cruise!

198
00:14:31.478 --> 00:14:32.412
- [Garrett] All right, we know.

199
00:14:32.546 --> 00:14:33.413
- Ha ha ha!

200
00:14:34.581 --> 00:14:35.817
- [Garrett] How come
I didn't get anything?


201
00:14:36.383 --> 00:14:37.852
- You didn't get anything what?

202
00:14:37.986 --> 00:14:39.553
- [Garrett] Like, you're
not giving me any crap.


203
00:14:39.687 --> 00:14:40.755
- [Emma] Wait, you're
giving stuff away?


204
00:14:40.889 --> 00:14:43.023
- Come, yes, come over.

205
00:14:43.156 --> 00:14:45.660
Whoever wants a
picture of my dead dog,


206
00:14:45.793 --> 00:14:46.694
you're welcome to it.

207
00:14:46.828 --> 00:14:47.662
- [Garrett] ] No thanks.

208
00:14:47.795 --> 00:14:48.663
- [Carol] M'kay.

209
00:14:57.104 --> 00:14:59.774
(mouse clicks)

210
00:15:04.779 --> 00:15:05.713
- [Emma] See that?

211
00:15:05.847 --> 00:15:07.247
- [Sophie] Yeah.

212
00:15:07.381 --> 00:15:08.248
- [Emma] Is that too big?

213
00:15:08.382 --> 00:15:09.383
- [Sophie] So good.

214
00:15:09.516 --> 00:15:10.384
I don't think it's too big.

215
00:15:10.517 --> 00:15:11.786
I'm just gonna eat it.

216
00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:13.821
Get the rest of these
champagne glasses.


217
00:15:13.955 --> 00:15:15.556
- [Emma] I should
probably cut that smaller.
-I don't know.


218
00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:17.025
- [Sophie] No, I think
that's a beautiful piece.


219
00:15:17.157 --> 00:15:18.492
- [Emma] It's huge.

220
00:15:18.625 --> 00:15:19.894
- [Sophie] We can leave
that one for Carol.


221
00:15:20.028 --> 00:15:21.595
- [Emma] Okay.

222
00:15:21.729 --> 00:15:23.096
- [Sophie] Since she's the one
we're actually celebrating.


223
00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:24.699
- [Emma] We are celebrating her.

224
00:15:24.832 --> 00:15:26.133
I'm gonna miss her.

225
00:15:26.266 --> 00:15:27.534
Did you know she was
going on a cruise?


226
00:15:27.669 --> 00:15:29.102
- [Sophie] I did overhear it.

227
00:15:29.236 --> 00:15:31.238
♪ For she's a
jolly good fellow ♪


228
00:15:31.371 --> 00:15:36.010
♪ For she's a
jolly good fellow ♪


229
00:15:36.143 --> 00:15:39.079
♪ Which nobody can deny ♪

230
00:15:39.212 --> 00:15:41.883
♪ Which nobody can deny ♪

231
00:15:42.016 --> 00:15:44.551
♪ Which nobody can deny ♪

232
00:15:44.686 --> 00:15:47.387
♪ For she's a
jolly good fellow ♪


233
00:15:47.521 --> 00:15:49.356
♪ For she's a jolly good ♪

234
00:15:49.489 --> 00:15:50.557
- Okay, all right, all right.

235
00:15:50.692 --> 00:15:52.192
Give her a hand,
give her a hand.


236
00:15:52.326 --> 00:15:53.560
(employees clapping
and chattering)


237
00:15:53.695 --> 00:15:54.762
- [Carol] Guys,
this is very sweet.


238
00:15:54.896 --> 00:15:56.196
(champagne cork popping)

239
00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:57.164
- [Sean] The card,
it's at my desk.


240
00:15:57.297 --> 00:15:59.533
- Wait, wait.

241
00:15:59.667 --> 00:16:01.401
Isn't that whole bottle for me?

242
00:16:01.535 --> 00:16:03.503
(employees laughing)

243
00:16:03.637 --> 00:16:04.638
I no share.

244
00:16:04.772 --> 00:16:05.873
And how about that cake?

245
00:16:06.007 --> 00:16:07.107
- [Garrett] I know,
it looks really good.


246
00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:08.943
(employees chattering)

247
00:16:09.077 --> 00:16:09.944
- Sorry about that, Carol.

248
00:16:10.078 --> 00:16:10.845
- Thank you, dolly.

249
00:16:12.245 --> 00:16:14.716
Okay, speak amongst yourselves.

250
00:16:14.849 --> 00:16:16.818
- [Garrett] Emma, do
you need help, or?


251
00:16:16.951 --> 00:16:17.819
You're good?

252
00:16:17.952 --> 00:16:18.820
- [Emma] I'm good.

253
00:16:18.953 --> 00:16:20.287
- [Doug] Thank you.

254
00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:21.856
- [Garrett] Where'd
you get this cake from?


255
00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:25.727
(employees talking quietly)

256
00:16:26.661 --> 00:16:27.962
- [Carol] Oh, it's very sweet.

257
00:16:28.096 --> 00:16:33.300
You all are very sweet,
and kind, and good.


258
00:16:34.635 --> 00:16:35.502
Thank you.

259
00:16:36.838 --> 00:16:38.039
- [Garrett] You
deserve it, Carol.


260
00:16:38.171 --> 00:16:38.906
- [Emma] Yeah, we love you.

261
00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:39.774
- Thank you.

262
00:16:39.907 --> 00:16:40.908
I love you guys.

263
00:16:41.042 --> 00:16:42.309
I'm gonna miss everyone so much.

264
00:16:42.442 --> 00:16:43.310
Okay, I'm not gonna cry.
(employees laughing)


265
00:16:43.443 --> 00:16:44.846
I'm not going to cry.

266
00:16:44.979 --> 00:16:45.980
- [Garrett] All right,
all right, all right.


267
00:16:46.114 --> 00:16:47.347
- I'm fine.

268
00:16:47.481 --> 00:16:48.215
- [Garrett] Okay,
clinks to Carol.


269
00:16:48.348 --> 00:16:48.950
- There we go.

270
00:16:49.083 --> 00:16:50.084
Perfect.

271
00:16:50.217 --> 00:16:51.218
Now I'm about to cry. (laughing)

272
00:16:51.351 --> 00:16:52.419
- It's over.

273
00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:54.521
I think I'm gonna,

274
00:16:54.656 --> 00:16:56.189
I think I'm gonna miss you all,

275
00:16:56.323 --> 00:16:59.027
and I think I'm gonna miss
this stupid office. (sniffing)


276
00:16:59.192 --> 00:17:00.394
- [Isobel] Hey!

277
00:17:01.495 --> 00:17:04.132
- I mean, this wonderful
office. (laughing)


278
00:17:04.264 --> 00:17:04.999
- [Isobel] There we go.

279
00:17:05.133 --> 00:17:06.633
There we go.

280
00:17:06.768 --> 00:17:09.436
- Oh, I'm unexpectedly
overwhelmed by all of this.


281
00:17:09.569 --> 00:17:11.171
Someone tell me not to go.

282
00:17:11.304 --> 00:17:12.272
- Don't go.
- Stay here.


283
00:17:12.406 --> 00:17:13.141
- [Carol] Okay.

284
00:17:13.273 --> 00:17:14.274
- Stay here.

285
00:17:14.408 --> 00:17:15.409
- You're not allowed to go.

286
00:17:15.542 --> 00:17:16.276
You're not going anywhere.

287
00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:17.277
- Oh, thank you.

288
00:17:17.411 --> 00:17:18.946
All right, now I can.

289
00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:20.815
- Will champagne convince
you to stay at least-


290
00:17:20.948 --> 00:17:23.084
- [Carol] I'll stay at least
for the rest of the day.


291
00:17:23.216 --> 00:17:24.551
- [Sophie] Through the night.

292
00:17:24.686 --> 00:17:26.020
- [Garrett] Rich, do you
need, what do you want?


293
00:17:26.154 --> 00:17:27.387
Champagne or cake?

294
00:17:27.521 --> 00:17:30.725
(gentle harp music)

295
00:17:34.128 --> 00:17:36.196
(seagulls calling)

296
00:17:36.329 --> 00:17:38.866
(lazy music)

297
00:17:42.369 --> 00:17:44.105
- [Doug] I don't know.

298
00:17:44.237 --> 00:17:45.773
The trouble is, it
just complete, it
doesn't work at all.


299
00:17:45.907 --> 00:17:49.209
It's, it, there's a
power button thing.


300
00:17:49.342 --> 00:17:50.945
Can you just come over?

301
00:17:51.079 --> 00:17:52.914
- [Rich] I don't wanna sound
silly, but is it plugged in?


302
00:17:53.047 --> 00:17:55.083
- [Doug] It, yeah,
that's the problem.


303
00:17:55.215 --> 00:17:57.451
When I plug it in, it
doesn't actually do anything.


304
00:17:57.584 --> 00:17:59.453
- [Rich] And there's no
lights on it or anything?


305
00:17:59.586 --> 00:18:01.889
- [Doug] There is a light,
but the light doesn't show,


306
00:18:02.023 --> 00:18:04.892
there's a light, there's
a warning sign or a signal


307
00:18:05.026 --> 00:18:07.360
says "HC warning signal."

308
00:18:08.228 --> 00:18:09.529
Yeah, we can just try to reboot.

309
00:18:09.664 --> 00:18:10.998
- [Rich] Okay, well
let's go take a look.


310
00:18:20.775 --> 00:18:23.310
(lazy music)

311
00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:35.622
(lazy music continues)

312
00:18:44.531 --> 00:18:45.867
- Yeah, so some
friends are saying,


313
00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.201
like, if you want to be
a true environmentalist,


314
00:18:47.334 --> 00:18:48.870
you have to get a used car.

315
00:18:49.003 --> 00:18:50.872
And I'm like, I had to get
something new with a warranty.


316
00:18:51.005 --> 00:18:52.206
- [Sean] Yeah, cause you
have to worry about the,


317
00:18:52.339 --> 00:18:55.308
the life of the battery, right?

318
00:18:55.442 --> 00:18:56.878
So how long are they good-

319
00:18:57.011 --> 00:18:58.012
- It's not gas.

320
00:18:58.146 --> 00:18:59.680
Can we just focus on the fact

321
00:18:59.814 --> 00:19:01.916
that I'm not gonna be
using gas and oil anymore?


322
00:19:02.049 --> 00:19:02.784
- [Sean] Okay.

323
00:19:02.917 --> 00:19:03.450
- Give that win.

324
00:19:03.583 --> 00:19:05.119
- [Sean] Okay.

325
00:19:05.253 --> 00:19:06.754
- I just think if you, you
don't wanna buy yourself a car


326
00:19:06.888 --> 00:19:09.489
that's gonna only
be good for a year.


327
00:19:09.623 --> 00:19:12.994
(lazy music continues)

328
00:19:22.435 --> 00:19:25.840
(lazy music continues)

329
00:19:34.581 --> 00:19:37.985
(lazy music continues)

330
00:19:46.794 --> 00:19:50.363
(lazy music continues)

331
00:19:58.338 --> 00:20:01.742
(lazy music continues)

332
00:20:04.846 --> 00:20:08.950
(employees conversing quietly)

333
00:20:17.591 --> 00:20:21.729
(employees conversing quietly)

334
00:20:22.629 --> 00:20:24.464
- Yes, that was the only time.

335
00:20:24.598 --> 00:20:25.398
- Same thing.
- She's like-


336
00:20:25.532 --> 00:20:26.399
- Right?

337
00:20:26.533 --> 00:20:27.400
- Then she's like-

338
00:20:27.534 --> 00:20:29.402
- Watching one thing.

339
00:20:29.536 --> 00:20:30.537
Game for a second.

340
00:20:30.671 --> 00:20:32.073
- (laughing) I'm serious.

341
00:20:32.206 --> 00:20:33.506
- Back to back to gaze here.

342
00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:35.442
- [Isobel] Let's not
do the bagels yet,


343
00:20:35.575 --> 00:20:36.844
but that's a treat for later.

344
00:20:36.978 --> 00:20:37.745
And uh-

345
00:20:37.879 --> 00:20:38.946
- Sorry.

346
00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:40.348
- Oh, not a worry.

347
00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:41.749
Perfect timing.

348
00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:45.119
We have one of those
for everyone, or no?


349
00:20:45.253 --> 00:20:46.153
Did you print enough?

350
00:20:46.287 --> 00:20:47.154
- Yes, yes.

351
00:20:47.288 --> 00:20:48.022
- Okay, of course.

352
00:20:50.291 --> 00:20:51.158
All right, everyone good?

353
00:20:51.292 --> 00:20:52.525
Put the phones away.

354
00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:55.528
Um, so let's get started.

355
00:20:55.663 --> 00:20:56.898
First things first,

356
00:20:57.031 --> 00:20:58.299
I would love to
introduce you all to,


357
00:20:58.431 --> 00:20:59.700
is everyone settled?

358
00:21:01.135 --> 00:21:03.104
I'd love to introduce you
all to the newest member


359
00:21:03.237 --> 00:21:05.438
of our little team,
our little family.


360
00:21:05.572 --> 00:21:07.174
- This is Robert.
- Hello.


361
00:21:07.308 --> 00:21:09.377
- He's in a green sweater;
he doesn't care who knows it.


362
00:21:09.509 --> 00:21:10.244
(Isobel laughing)

363
00:21:10.378 --> 00:21:11.611
- Don't care.

364
00:21:11.746 --> 00:21:13.714
- He comes from
McDougal and Charter.


365
00:21:13.848 --> 00:21:14.849
All the way from Seattle.

366
00:21:14.982 --> 00:21:16.183
(employees reacting in surprise)

367
00:21:16.317 --> 00:21:17.818
He's a really awesome guy.

368
00:21:17.952 --> 00:21:19.720
We really clicked right away.

369
00:21:19.854 --> 00:21:22.089
And he'll be taking over
for Carol's position.


370
00:21:22.223 --> 00:21:24.025
And we are so
excited to have you.


371
00:21:24.158 --> 00:21:26.526
So thank you, Robert, for
being here with us today.


372
00:21:26.661 --> 00:21:27.929
- Well, thank you for having me.

373
00:21:28.062 --> 00:21:29.697
- [Isobel] Thank you for
having us to have you.


374
00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:31.732
Thank you for having
us have you. (laughing)


375
00:21:31.866 --> 00:21:32.400
- Yes.

376
00:21:32.532 --> 00:21:34.135
- There we go.

377
00:21:34.268 --> 00:21:36.771
Now I do have to warn you that
we do have a lot of fun here.


378
00:21:36.904 --> 00:21:39.006
We do things with a
little more pizzazz,


379
00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:42.076
and let's just all right
now go around the room


380
00:21:42.209 --> 00:21:43.678
and introduce ourselves,

381
00:21:43.811 --> 00:21:48.515
and maybe we can mention
our favorite food.


382
00:21:49.984 --> 00:21:54.255
I'm Isobel and I enjoy a ribeye.

383
00:21:54.388 --> 00:21:55.189
A ribeye steak.

384
00:21:55.323 --> 00:21:56.123
- [Emma] Ooh.

385
00:21:56.257 --> 00:21:57.224
- [Sean] Nice.

386
00:21:57.358 --> 00:21:59.193
- [Isobel] Yeah.

387
00:21:59.327 --> 00:22:01.896
- Uh, I'm Doug.

388
00:22:02.029 --> 00:22:03.164
- Hello.

389
00:22:03.297 --> 00:22:04.298
- I like chowder.

390
00:22:04.432 --> 00:22:05.700
- Nice.

391
00:22:05.833 --> 00:22:06.566
- [Isobel] Mmm, I
forget about chowder.


392
00:22:06.701 --> 00:22:07.567
- Chowder.

393
00:22:07.702 --> 00:22:08.703
- In a bread bowl.

394
00:22:08.836 --> 00:22:09.837
Those bread bowls are so good.

395
00:22:09.971 --> 00:22:11.105
- Yeah, I like the bread bowl.

396
00:22:11.471 --> 00:22:12.639
Hi, I'm Garrett.

397
00:22:12.773 --> 00:22:13.506
- [Robert] Hello.

398
00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:15.242
- Hi.

399
00:22:15.376 --> 00:22:16.377
Spaghetti.

400
00:22:16.509 --> 00:22:17.845
- [Isobel] And meatballs!

401
00:22:17.979 --> 00:22:19.579
- No, Isobel, I'm
still vegetarian.


402
00:22:19.714 --> 00:22:20.781
- [Isobel] Okay.

403
00:22:23.184 --> 00:22:25.052
- Hi, I'm Emma.

404
00:22:25.186 --> 00:22:29.023
And I guess I'd have
to say my favorite food


405
00:22:31.425 --> 00:22:32.293
is martinis!

406
00:22:32.426 --> 00:22:33.160
(Isobel laughing loudly)

407
00:22:33.294 --> 00:22:34.161
- She did not.

408
00:22:34.295 --> 00:22:35.595
Didn't hear that.

409
00:22:35.730 --> 00:22:37.031
- I know it's not
technically a food,


410
00:22:37.164 --> 00:22:38.598
but I like to get it
with the green olives


411
00:22:38.733 --> 00:22:39.767
with the blue cheese
on the inside.


412
00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:41.402
- [Isobel] It counts, it counts.

413
00:22:41.534 --> 00:22:42.970
- [Emma] It does count.

414
00:22:43.104 --> 00:22:43.771
- I'm Fran.

415
00:22:43.904 --> 00:22:44.972
I like cottage cheese.

416
00:22:46.639 --> 00:22:49.176
- I forget about
that, cottage cheese.


417
00:22:50.745 --> 00:22:52.046
- Sean, nice to meet you.

418
00:22:52.179 --> 00:22:55.216
I like a cobb salad
with extra bacon.


419
00:22:55.349 --> 00:22:56.684
- [Isobel] Yum, bacon.

420
00:22:58.419 --> 00:22:59.286
- Rich.

421
00:23:00.187 --> 00:23:01.055
Fish.

422
00:23:02.456 --> 00:23:04.325
- Which you catch yourself.

423
00:23:04.458 --> 00:23:05.326
- Oh my God.

424
00:23:05.459 --> 00:23:07.661
- I, I don't fish.

425
00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:10.297
- [Isobel] I saw a picture
of you with a fish.


426
00:23:10.431 --> 00:23:11.564
- [Emma] Somebody fishes here.

427
00:23:11.699 --> 00:23:13.067
- [Rich] It's a lie.

428
00:23:14.402 --> 00:23:15.635
- Don't fish.

429
00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:16.636
- I just, I thought
it (mumbling).


430
00:23:16.771 --> 00:23:17.772
- [Garrett] It's okay.

431
00:23:17.905 --> 00:23:20.141
- Oh, oh, I'm Sophie the intern.

432
00:23:20.274 --> 00:23:21.509
As you all know.

433
00:23:21.642 --> 00:23:25.179
And I really love Thai food.

434
00:23:25.312 --> 00:23:26.180
- [Isobel] Mmm.

435
00:23:27.348 --> 00:23:30.751
- Hello, I'm Robert, and
I also love Thai food.


436
00:23:30.885 --> 00:23:32.119
- [Sophie] Oh.

437
00:23:32.253 --> 00:23:33.821
- Something in common
between you two.


438
00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:38.526
Great, now I'm
starving. (laughing)


439
00:23:38.659 --> 00:23:39.660
Where's those bagels?

440
00:23:39.794 --> 00:23:40.694
Where's those bagels?

441
00:23:40.828 --> 00:23:42.229
No, we can't dip in yet.

442
00:23:42.363 --> 00:23:44.498
Robert, did you have
anything else to say?


443
00:23:44.631 --> 00:23:45.833
- Hello again.

444
00:23:46.934 --> 00:23:48.302
I guess in addition
to Thai food,


445
00:23:48.436 --> 00:23:49.470
I love going to the movies.

446
00:23:49.602 --> 00:23:51.138
- [Isobel] Mmm.

447
00:23:51.272 --> 00:23:54.607
- Yeah, yeah, big movies
and uncomfortable silences.


448
00:23:57.845 --> 00:23:58.712
Like that.

449
00:23:58.846 --> 00:24:00.414
(Isobel laughing)

450
00:24:00.548 --> 00:24:01.614
- Robert!

451
00:24:03.818 --> 00:24:05.886
Um, let's get started.

452
00:24:07.088 --> 00:24:09.190
Let's look at the
agenda for the today.


453
00:24:09.323 --> 00:24:10.590
Enough fun.

454
00:24:10.724 --> 00:24:13.928
Time to put on my
work hat. (chuckling)


455
00:24:15.729 --> 00:24:17.364
- Steve.
- Okay.


456
00:24:17.498 --> 00:24:18.365
- [Emma] Hello.

457
00:24:19.867 --> 00:24:21.168
Who's on line two?

458
00:24:21.302 --> 00:24:22.336
I don't have anybody.

459
00:24:24.505 --> 00:24:27.842
- Emma, what is this?

460
00:24:29.609 --> 00:24:31.112
- [Emma] That pulls staples.

461
00:24:31.912 --> 00:24:32.780
Staple puller.

462
00:24:32.913 --> 00:24:34.281
- I think I knew that.

463
00:24:34.415 --> 00:24:35.416
Or I was just joking.

464
00:24:35.549 --> 00:24:36.417
I was probably just joking.

465
00:24:36.550 --> 00:24:37.685
- [Emma] You're funny.

466
00:24:37.818 --> 00:24:39.220
- Yeah, I know.
- [Emma] Funny.


467
00:24:39.353 --> 00:24:40.688
- It'd be weird if I
didn't know what that was.


468
00:24:40.821 --> 00:24:41.689
(Emma chuckling)

469
00:24:41.822 --> 00:24:43.757
(wrapper crinkling)

470
00:24:43.891 --> 00:24:44.758
- Yeah, did you find
everything you need?


471
00:24:44.892 --> 00:24:46.694
- [Robert] Not yet.

472
00:24:46.827 --> 00:24:48.095
- [Emma] Wow, (mumbling).

473
00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:50.865
- [Robert] Score.

474
00:24:50.998 --> 00:24:54.468
On the side angle,
too, which is tough.


475
00:24:54.602 --> 00:24:55.469
Stronger like this.

476
00:24:55.603 --> 00:24:56.871
It was that way.

477
00:24:59.707 --> 00:25:00.574
- [Garrett] I'll see you.

478
00:25:00.708 --> 00:25:01.575
- [Sophie] I'll stop by.

479
00:25:01.709 --> 00:25:02.910
- [Garrett] Please.

480
00:25:05.412 --> 00:25:08.649
(contemplative music)

481
00:25:08.782 --> 00:25:11.051
- Oh hey, pad Thai buddy.

482
00:25:11.185 --> 00:25:12.753
- [Robert] Hey, where
can I find a mug?


483
00:25:12.887 --> 00:25:14.121
- Upper left.

484
00:25:14.255 --> 00:25:15.122
You can choose
whichever one you like.


485
00:25:15.256 --> 00:25:16.056
- Thanks.

486
00:25:17.291 --> 00:25:18.792
- [Sophie] Oh yeah, I can never
tell if I'm in a sweet mood


487
00:25:18.926 --> 00:25:20.528
or a savory mood.

488
00:25:20.694 --> 00:25:23.631
- [Robert] Peanut butter
crackers; a little bit of both.


489
00:25:23.764 --> 00:25:24.832
- [Sophie] Smart.

490
00:25:25.733 --> 00:25:28.936
Take one of these. (groaning)

491
00:25:30.104 --> 00:25:34.074
So did you go to
school in Seattle?


492
00:25:34.208 --> 00:25:35.644
- No, in Montreal actually.

493
00:25:35.776 --> 00:25:36.645
McGill.

494
00:25:36.777 --> 00:25:38.279
- [Sophie] Cool, cool.

495
00:25:38.412 --> 00:25:41.749
So from Canada, to Seattle,
to our little town.


496
00:25:42.651 --> 00:25:43.951
It's kinda weird moves.

497
00:25:44.985 --> 00:25:46.086
- [Robert] Guess they are.

498
00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:47.621
- Yeah.

499
00:25:47.755 --> 00:25:51.358
(coffee maker gurgling)

500
00:25:51.492 --> 00:25:53.727
Well, if you ever need
to be shown around,


501
00:25:53.861 --> 00:25:57.765
it takes about 10 minutes, so.

502
00:25:57.898 --> 00:25:58.632
- Okay.

503
00:25:58.766 --> 00:25:59.633
Yeah, thanks.

504
00:25:59.767 --> 00:26:00.935
- Yeah, you got it.

505
00:26:05.406 --> 00:26:06.807
- [Robert] Hey.

506
00:26:08.442 --> 00:26:09.810
- Hi.

507
00:26:09.944 --> 00:26:11.011
- Fran, right?

508
00:26:13.581 --> 00:26:14.415
- Yeah.

509
00:26:23.891 --> 00:26:26.894
(floor creaking)

510
00:26:30.831 --> 00:26:32.866
- There was something else.

511
00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.102
Wasn't like some simple
part of something.


512
00:26:35.236 --> 00:26:37.771
- [Sean] When was the last
time you saw a podiatrist?


513
00:26:37.905 --> 00:26:39.708
- [Emma] I've never
seen a podiatrist.


514
00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:41.442
My feet are perfect.

515
00:26:41.575 --> 00:26:44.044
This is like the worst thing
that's ever happened to me.


516
00:26:44.178 --> 00:26:46.247
- [Sean] Your feet are
perfect, Emma, but-


517
00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:48.182
- Come on, okay.

518
00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:50.584
- What's up man?

519
00:26:50.719 --> 00:26:51.785
- Hey.

520
00:26:54.588 --> 00:26:55.789
- [Garrett] I don't know.

521
00:26:55.923 --> 00:26:59.994
(employees conversing
and laughing)


522
00:27:08.135 --> 00:27:11.038
- [Rich] Are you
good with the kids?


523
00:27:11.171 --> 00:27:12.172
- [Sean] I'm sorry.

524
00:27:12.306 --> 00:27:14.375
You know what, I can ask.

525
00:27:14.508 --> 00:27:15.776
- Fair enough.

526
00:27:15.909 --> 00:27:17.244
Have a good one.

527
00:27:17.378 --> 00:27:20.781
(employees continue
conversing quietly)


528
00:27:20.914 --> 00:27:22.249
- [Emma] Hey, Robert.

529
00:27:22.383 --> 00:27:23.718
You don't have any
band-aids, do you?


530
00:27:23.851 --> 00:27:25.019
- [Robert] Not in my pocket.

531
00:27:25.152 --> 00:27:26.854
- [Emma] Okay, fair enough.

532
00:27:26.987 --> 00:27:28.289
- [Robert] Hi, Rich.

533
00:27:28.422 --> 00:27:29.423
- [Emma] I usually
carry them in my purse.


534
00:27:29.556 --> 00:27:30.824
(keyboard clicking)

535
00:27:30.958 --> 00:27:31.959
- [Garrett] Oh,
it's his voicemail.


536
00:27:32.559 --> 00:27:34.128
- Hey.
- Hi.


537
00:27:34.261 --> 00:27:37.631
I was wondering if um, it's
really hot in my office.


538
00:27:37.766 --> 00:27:38.499
- [Garrett] Is it?

539
00:27:38.632 --> 00:27:39.933
- [Doug] Yeah.

540
00:27:40.067 --> 00:27:42.536
And I was wondering if
you were using this fan?


541
00:27:42.671 --> 00:27:43.804
- [Garrett] Well, yeah, Doug.

542
00:27:43.937 --> 00:27:44.805
It's my fan.

543
00:27:44.938 --> 00:27:46.240
- [Doug] I know...

544
00:27:46.373 --> 00:27:47.841
- [Garrett] Do you
wanna borrow it?


545
00:27:47.975 --> 00:27:49.343
- [Doug] Yeah, I would
love to borrow it.


546
00:27:49.476 --> 00:27:51.078
I mean, honestly,

547
00:27:51.211 --> 00:27:52.212
I don't know what's going
on with the heat in there.


548
00:27:52.346 --> 00:27:54.148
I can't really open my window.

549
00:27:55.650 --> 00:27:56.884
So...

550
00:27:57.017 --> 00:27:57.851
- [Garrett] Go ahead.

551
00:27:57.985 --> 00:27:59.019
- [Doug] Really?

552
00:27:59.153 --> 00:28:00.421
- [Garrett] Yes, Doug.

553
00:28:01.790 --> 00:28:02.791
- [Doug] Thanks, Garrett.

554
00:28:02.923 --> 00:28:03.891
- [Garrett] You're welcome.

555
00:28:05.492 --> 00:28:08.562
I just need it back
like in an hour or two.


556
00:28:08.697 --> 00:28:09.430
- [Doug] Really?

557
00:28:09.563 --> 00:28:10.431
- [Garrett] No.

558
00:28:11.298 --> 00:28:12.866
- [Doug] I appreciate it.

559
00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:19.873
- [Garrett] I've never
used that fan. (cackling)


560
00:28:21.875 --> 00:28:22.744
- Are you able to-

561
00:28:22.876 --> 00:28:23.745
- Do you need help?

562
00:28:23.877 --> 00:28:24.878
- No, can you just move?

563
00:28:25.012 --> 00:28:25.879
I just-

564
00:28:26.013 --> 00:28:26.980
- Oh, I can move.

565
00:28:27.114 --> 00:28:28.182
I'm sorry.

566
00:28:29.751 --> 00:28:30.617
Are you sure?

567
00:28:30.752 --> 00:28:31.485
- Yeah, I'm good.

568
00:28:31.618 --> 00:28:32.353
I'm good.

569
00:28:32.486 --> 00:28:33.220
I'm good.

570
00:28:33.354 --> 00:28:34.088
Thank you.

571
00:28:35.189 --> 00:28:36.457
- No problem.

572
00:28:41.696 --> 00:28:45.632
(employees conversing quietly)

573
00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:50.104
(keyboard clicking)

574
00:28:53.107 --> 00:28:55.175
- [Rich] I don't know,
it might need a battery.


575
00:28:59.781 --> 00:29:00.648
Somewhere.

576
00:29:04.753 --> 00:29:06.120
There you go.

577
00:29:06.253 --> 00:29:07.421
- [Garrett] Thank you.

578
00:29:07.554 --> 00:29:09.089
- [Rich] Sure.

579
00:29:09.223 --> 00:29:12.426
(keyboard clicking)

580
00:29:14.194 --> 00:29:16.397
- [Doug] Hey, I don't know

581
00:29:16.530 --> 00:29:19.299
if there's something I'm
doing wrong, but it's,


582
00:29:19.433 --> 00:29:22.136
I plugged it in, and I
couldn't get it to work.


583
00:29:24.271 --> 00:29:25.840
(Robert laughing)

584
00:29:25.973 --> 00:29:28.409
- [Garrett] I don't know if
it works, Doug. (laughing)


585
00:29:28.542 --> 00:29:30.511
I was just telling
Sean, I'm serious,


586
00:29:30.645 --> 00:29:31.746
oh, you know what?

587
00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:33.447
You don't know if it works?

588
00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:35.015
- [Doug] I don't know 'cause
I haven't really used it.


589
00:29:35.149 --> 00:29:36.718
- [Garrett] You
haven't ever used it?


590
00:29:36.851 --> 00:29:38.552
Or when's the last time
you used it and it worked?


591
00:29:38.686 --> 00:29:41.255
You know, Sean has a fan.

592
00:29:42.523 --> 00:29:45.125
- [Sean] Yeah, I've
never used it either.


593
00:29:45.259 --> 00:29:47.060
- [Doug] Well, do you
mind if I give it a try?


594
00:29:47.194 --> 00:29:49.329
- [Sean] Yeah, but I don't
think it's gonna work.


595
00:29:50.899 --> 00:29:53.701
- [Doug] Well, I'll tell you
what, can I give you this back?


596
00:29:53.835 --> 00:29:54.568
- [Garrett] Sure.

597
00:29:54.702 --> 00:29:55.436
- [Doug] Okay.

598
00:29:55.569 --> 00:29:57.171
You want it?

599
00:29:57.304 --> 00:29:58.605
- [Sean] Why don't I take
that fan, and then you...


600
00:29:58.740 --> 00:29:59.808
- [Doug] You mind
if he gets the fan?


601
00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:00.941
- [Sean] Not at all.

602
00:30:01.074 --> 00:30:02.376
- [Doug] This one doesn't work.

603
00:30:02.509 --> 00:30:04.178
I mean, unless my
outlets aren't working,


604
00:30:04.311 --> 00:30:05.312
but I don't think that's
the case 'cause other things


605
00:30:05.446 --> 00:30:06.547
are working when I plug them in.

606
00:30:06.681 --> 00:30:07.682
- [Garrett] It's this-

607
00:30:07.816 --> 00:30:08.817
- [Sean] It's not even plugged.

608
00:30:08.949 --> 00:30:09.818
- [Garrett] Where is your fan?

609
00:30:09.950 --> 00:30:10.685
- [Sean] This one?

610
00:30:10.819 --> 00:30:11.952
Right there.

611
00:30:12.085 --> 00:30:13.420
- This?
- Yeah, that's the fan.


612
00:30:13.554 --> 00:30:14.689
- [Garrett] Can I just
take this one for now,


613
00:30:14.823 --> 00:30:16.089
and you can try that one?

614
00:30:16.223 --> 00:30:17.291
- [Sean] Why don't
you take both of them?


615
00:30:17.424 --> 00:30:18.025
Here.

616
00:30:18.158 --> 00:30:20.194
(keyboard clicking)

617
00:30:20.327 --> 00:30:21.528
- [Doug] Feels good.

618
00:30:22.629 --> 00:30:23.497
Thank you.

619
00:30:23.630 --> 00:30:25.132
- [Garrett] Anytime.

620
00:30:25.265 --> 00:30:28.837
(Robert laughing)

621
00:30:28.969 --> 00:30:32.105
(discordant music)

622
00:30:41.181 --> 00:30:45.185
(discordant music continues)

623
00:30:54.127 --> 00:30:58.098
(discordant music continues)

624
00:31:05.172 --> 00:31:08.375
(crickets chirping)

625
00:31:15.549 --> 00:31:19.553
(crickets continue chirping)

626
00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:28.830
(Robert speaking)

627
00:31:28.963 --> 00:31:30.397
- Kisses; later.

628
00:31:31.398 --> 00:31:35.670
(television playing in distance)

629
00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:43.110
(Fran sighing)

630
00:31:51.251 --> 00:31:55.355
(television continues playing)

631
00:32:00.394 --> 00:32:03.597
(footsteps padding)

632
00:32:09.771 --> 00:32:12.306
(coat rustling)

633
00:32:12.439 --> 00:32:15.710
(objects clattering)

634
00:32:22.282 --> 00:32:25.687
(clattering continues)

635
00:32:30.992 --> 00:32:34.194
(footsteps padding)

636
00:32:39.734 --> 00:32:42.402
(Sean sighing)

637
00:32:43.838 --> 00:32:45.238
- [Garrett] My dog
is trying to kill me.


638
00:32:45.372 --> 00:32:46.741
That's fine.

639
00:32:46.874 --> 00:32:48.542
I know it's not good,
but he is a little guy.


640
00:32:48.676 --> 00:32:53.180
I just adopted him and you know,
dogs have accidents, right?


641
00:32:53.313 --> 00:32:54.816
I'm talking about an accident.

642
00:32:54.949 --> 00:32:56.884
Like, he peed on the
carpet, floor on occasion,


643
00:32:57.018 --> 00:32:59.353
but he does it every time
in front of the bathroom.


644
00:32:59.486 --> 00:33:01.055
So you know,
midnight, 2:00 a.m.,


645
00:33:01.188 --> 00:33:03.658
you walk around your house, I
mean, like if you had a pet.


646
00:33:03.791 --> 00:33:05.525
Are you like walking around
your house being like,


647
00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:07.527
"Oh, I wonder if my dog peed
here so I can slip on it


648
00:33:07.662 --> 00:33:09.162
"before I go take
a piss myself."


649
00:33:09.296 --> 00:33:10.597
- [Robert] No coffee?

650
00:33:10.732 --> 00:33:11.933
- [Garrett] No, I
already had one.


651
00:33:12.066 --> 00:33:13.333
- Okay.
- All right.


652
00:33:13.467 --> 00:33:15.003
Just too much pee in
every, oh, morning Fran.


653
00:33:15.135 --> 00:33:17.805
Not to mention the pee, he's
pooping like crazy, too.


654
00:33:17.939 --> 00:33:20.008
I mean, I've been giving him
broccoli, a little yogurt.


655
00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:22.644
I shouldn't have given him the
yogurt, but blueberries, too.


656
00:33:22.777 --> 00:33:25.113
'Cause you know, dogs can
have fruits and vegetables,


657
00:33:25.245 --> 00:33:26.313
but now his poop is blue.

658
00:33:26.446 --> 00:33:28.716
So I'm getting blue poop in the,

659
00:33:28.850 --> 00:33:30.384
I'm sorry, sorry.

660
00:33:30.517 --> 00:33:31.986
Too much poop talk
on a Thursday.


661
00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:32.987
I'll see you inside.

662
00:33:33.121 --> 00:33:33.855
- Oh, not at all.

663
00:33:34.856 --> 00:33:36.289
Blue poops; pretty wild.

664
00:33:39.961 --> 00:33:41.628
- What do you call a sad coffee?

665
00:33:42.529 --> 00:33:43.530
- I don't know.

666
00:33:43.665 --> 00:33:44.732
What do you call a sad coffee?

667
00:33:44.866 --> 00:33:46.034
- A depresso.

668
00:33:46.166 --> 00:33:48.535
- (chuckling) You're funny.

669
00:33:51.304 --> 00:33:53.041
- Are you done with
that order form yet?


670
00:33:53.173 --> 00:33:54.274
- [Robert] Um, no, not yet.

671
00:33:54.408 --> 00:33:55.208
Do you need it today?

672
00:33:55.342 --> 00:33:56.209
- Oh, no, no.

673
00:33:56.343 --> 00:33:58.345
It's fine if you can't.

674
00:33:58.478 --> 00:34:00.447
- It'd be a lot
cooler if you did.


675
00:34:02.116 --> 00:34:06.219
That was a terrible Matthew
McConaughey impression.


676
00:34:07.989 --> 00:34:09.222
Wooderson?

677
00:34:09.356 --> 00:34:10.992
"Dazed and Confused?"

678
00:34:11.125 --> 00:34:12.459
- A movie?

679
00:34:12.592 --> 00:34:14.528
- [Robert] A very good movie.

680
00:34:14.662 --> 00:34:16.798
I can't believe you
haven't seen that.


681
00:34:18.331 --> 00:34:20.168
- Have you been to
the Columbia yet?


682
00:34:21.401 --> 00:34:22.737
- [Robert] I'm actually gonna
see something there tonight.


683
00:34:22.870 --> 00:34:23.738
- Oh.

684
00:34:24.604 --> 00:34:26.273
- [Robert] Do you want to come.

685
00:34:26.406 --> 00:34:27.141
- Bobby Boy.

686
00:34:27.274 --> 00:34:28.142
Sorry I'm late.

687
00:34:28.275 --> 00:34:29.010
I'm ready when you are.

688
00:34:29.143 --> 00:34:30.011
- Okay, great.

689
00:34:30.144 --> 00:34:31.679
Be there in a sec.

690
00:34:31.813 --> 00:34:32.914
- Yes.

691
00:34:33.047 --> 00:34:34.048
- Huh?

692
00:34:34.182 --> 00:34:35.049
- Sorry, the movie tonight.

693
00:34:35.183 --> 00:34:35.950
- Oh, okay, great.

694
00:34:36.084 --> 00:34:37.151
Movie at 7:00?

695
00:34:37.284 --> 00:34:38.753
That all right?

696
00:34:38.886 --> 00:34:40.454
- Seven.

697
00:34:40.587 --> 00:34:42.757

too early to get fired.

00:36:02.970 --> 00:36:04.205
You made it.

707
00:36:04.337 --> 00:36:05.338
- Am I late?

708
00:36:05.472 --> 00:36:06.707
- Oh no, we're both early.

709
00:36:08.109 --> 00:36:08.843
- I'll just get my ticket.

710
00:36:08.976 --> 00:36:09.944
- Oh no, I...

711
00:36:11.913 --> 00:36:12.579
- Oh.

712
00:36:12.713 --> 00:36:13.446

713
00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:14.447
I went ahead.

-I'll give you cash.

715

- Oh no, it's my treat.

716
00:36:17.417 --> 00:36:18.286
Come on.

717
00:36:18.418 --> 00:36:21.421

718
00:36:26.794 --> 00:36:28.461
I'm gonna get a Coke.

719
00:36:28.595 --> 00:36:29.831
You want anything?

720
00:36:29.964 --> 00:36:31.132
- No, thank you.

721
00:36:31.265 --> 00:36:33.034

723
00:36:34.168 --> 00:36:35.368
- How's it going, man?

724
00:36:35.502 --> 00:36:37.271
Um, large Coke.

725

- What?

741
00:38:27.014 --> 00:38:28.448

to get some food?

- Why?

807
00:41:17.084 --> 00:41:18.953
- You get to watch, you know,

808
00:41:19.086 --> 00:41:20.754
you get to look for something,

809
00:41:20.888 --> 00:41:22.790
and then try to understand it.

810
00:41:22.923 --> 00:41:24.624

you can throw popcorn at it-

00:41:47.715 --> 00:41:48.582
(glasses clink)

822
00:41:48.716 --> 00:41:51.619
- Saving mine for after.

823
00:41:51.752 --> 00:41:54.788
(Robert stumbling and laughing)

824
00:41:54.922 --> 00:41:56.090
- It on my face?

825
00:41:57.258 --> 00:41:58.859
What if I'd just kept
it there the whole time


826
00:41:58.993 --> 00:42:00.194
we're eating pie?

827
00:42:01.228 --> 00:42:03.831
- It would be
uncomfortable to watch.


828
00:42:05.299 --> 00:42:06.267
- Fair enough.

829
00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:07.268
- Thank you.

830
00:42:07.401 --> 00:42:08.135
- You're welcome.

831
00:42:09.270 --> 00:42:10.471
I wouldn't have
been uncomfortable,


832
00:42:10.604 --> 00:42:12.339
just to give you a heads up.

833
00:42:12.473 --> 00:42:13.340
- I'm sure.

834
00:42:14.608 --> 00:42:17.478
♪ Someday hey ♪

835
00:42:17.611 --> 00:42:21.715
♪ Tonight I need
your sweet caress ♪


836
00:42:21.849 --> 00:42:24.218
♪ Hold me ♪

837
00:42:24.351 --> 00:42:25.452
- Don't you walk?

838
00:42:25.586 --> 00:42:27.656
Yeah, I walk head down,
like kind of like,


839
00:42:27.788 --> 00:42:28.657
kind of like this.

840
00:42:28.789 --> 00:42:30.057
That's how I walk.

841
00:42:30.191 --> 00:42:31.392
I guess who walks like-

842
00:42:31.525 --> 00:42:32.393
- Have a good night guys.

843
00:42:32.526 --> 00:42:34.094
- Thank you.

844
00:42:34.228 --> 00:42:36.063
We didn't agree on the movie,
but we did agree on the pie.


845
00:42:36.197 --> 00:42:37.865
- Well, food's the
important thing.


846
00:42:37.998 --> 00:42:41.902
Oh, speaking of, I host a little
get-together on Saturdays.


847
00:42:42.036 --> 00:42:45.573
There's food, good
people, good times.


848
00:42:45.706 --> 00:42:46.907
You two should come.

849
00:42:48.776 --> 00:42:50.277
- Let's do it.

850
00:42:50.411 --> 00:42:51.646
- Great.

851
00:42:51.779 --> 00:42:53.013
I live behind the
purple house on Stewart,


852
00:42:53.147 --> 00:42:54.148
right on the river.

853
00:42:54.281 --> 00:42:55.115
You know it?

854
00:42:55.249 --> 00:42:56.317
- Uh, no.
- I know it.


855
00:42:56.450 --> 00:42:57.184
- [Amelia] Super.

856
00:42:57.318 --> 00:42:57.851
See you then.

857
00:42:57.985 --> 00:42:58.953
- See you then.

858
00:42:59.086 --> 00:43:00.454
- [Amelia] Beautiful.

859
00:43:00.588 --> 00:43:01.455
Good night.

860
00:43:01.589 --> 00:43:02.456
- [Robert] Good night.

861
00:43:02.590 --> 00:43:03.891
- [Fran] Good night.

862
00:43:04.024 --> 00:43:06.026
- I don't have a lot
of stuff in my place.


863
00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:07.728
I still gotta get furniture.

864
00:43:07.861 --> 00:43:09.263
I wanna get an armchair.

865
00:43:09.396 --> 00:43:12.166
But I sometimes think
of like if the armchair


866
00:43:12.299 --> 00:43:14.201
was actually shaped like an arm,

867
00:43:15.369 --> 00:43:17.137
like it would be
more comfortable.


868
00:43:17.271 --> 00:43:19.840
Like if I just dropped my
arm on there and shaped.


869
00:43:19.974 --> 00:43:21.542
- Like how?

870
00:43:21.676 --> 00:43:22.876
- It's like this, you put
it, it's like your arm.


871
00:43:23.010 --> 00:43:24.545
I'm putting my arm into an arm.

872
00:43:24.679 --> 00:43:26.347
It's kind of like meta,
you know what I mean?


873
00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:29.049
(car revving)

874
00:43:33.688 --> 00:43:36.390
I don't like when, you know,
people have like raincoats.


875
00:43:36.523 --> 00:43:37.258
I like raincoats.

876
00:43:37.391 --> 00:43:38.727
Don't, don't.

877
00:43:38.859 --> 00:43:41.462
But I mean, there's people
that don't bring an umbrella,


878
00:43:41.595 --> 00:43:43.464
and it's raining, and
they just tell you,


879
00:43:43.597 --> 00:43:46.967
they're like, "I just,
I just have a raincoat.


880
00:43:47.101 --> 00:43:48.102
"I don't need the umbrella."

881
00:43:48.235 --> 00:43:49.837
I'm like, this person's insane.

882
00:43:49.970 --> 00:43:51.438
They must have like
killed somebody


883
00:43:51.572 --> 00:43:52.906
and put 'em in a basement.

884
00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:55.644
So you're gonna walk
around, no umbrella,


885
00:43:55.776 --> 00:43:58.912
let rain hit you and act
like the rain's not there?


886
00:43:59.046 --> 00:44:00.281
That's nuts.

887
00:44:00.414 --> 00:44:03.050
You for sure are
like, you have a van,


888
00:44:03.183 --> 00:44:04.753
and you're doing weird stuff.

889
00:44:04.885 --> 00:44:08.355
I wouldn't tell them to their
face, but isn't that weird?


890
00:44:08.489 --> 00:44:11.760
Sorry, I ramble too
much when I get nervous.


891
00:44:11.892 --> 00:44:13.327
- I don't use an umbrella.

892
00:44:20.769 --> 00:44:21.802
- This is me.

893
00:44:21.935 --> 00:44:23.137
- It's nice and big.

894
00:44:24.004 --> 00:44:26.073
- Oh, it's just this one.

895
00:44:39.721 --> 00:44:40.722
Good night.

896
00:44:40.854 --> 00:44:42.923
- See you in the morning.

897
00:44:51.432 --> 00:44:54.168
(keys jingling)

898
00:44:56.437 --> 00:44:59.239
(door squeaking)

899
00:45:03.812 --> 00:45:06.781
(sheets rustling)

900
00:45:06.914 --> 00:45:09.917
(light clicking)

901
00:45:17.024 --> 00:45:19.426
(no audio)

902
00:45:27.034 --> 00:45:29.903
(wind blowing)

903
00:45:35.109 --> 00:45:36.845
(waves crashing)

904
00:45:36.977 --> 00:45:39.913
(forlorn music)

905
00:45:47.921 --> 00:45:51.525
(forlorn music continues)

906
00:46:00.300 --> 00:46:04.104
(forlorn music continues)

907
00:46:09.309 --> 00:46:10.177
- [Sean] Hey, Emma.

908
00:46:10.310 --> 00:46:11.078
Want help with that?

909
00:46:11.211 --> 00:46:12.346
- Shh-yeah.

910
00:46:17.151 --> 00:46:19.019
Who does this go down to?

911
00:46:19.821 --> 00:46:20.688
- Doug.

912
00:46:29.898 --> 00:46:31.833
(mouse clicking)

913
00:46:31.965 --> 00:46:35.169
(keyboard clicking)

914
00:46:37.204 --> 00:46:39.373
- [Sophie] Hi, are you
doing anything for lunch?


915
00:46:39.506 --> 00:46:43.510
- Yeah, Garrett and I, we're
gonna get some Italian.


916
00:46:43.645 --> 00:46:44.646
- Okay,

917
00:46:44.779 --> 00:46:45.379
- He's craving meatballs.

918
00:46:45.512 --> 00:46:46.046
- Nice.

919
00:46:46.180 --> 00:46:49.416
(both laughing)

920
00:46:49.550 --> 00:46:50.350
Right.

921
00:46:50.484 --> 00:46:51.686
- [Emma] Yeah, what you doing?

922
00:46:51.820 --> 00:46:55.322
(employees conversing quietly)

923
00:46:56.623 --> 00:46:57.826
- Hey.

924
00:46:57.958 --> 00:46:59.393
Sorry, did I surprise you?

925
00:47:00.127 --> 00:47:02.062
- Yeah, no, sorry.

926
00:47:02.196 --> 00:47:04.031
Did you need something?

927
00:47:04.164 --> 00:47:07.702
- Um, yeah, I just
wanted to give you this.


928
00:47:07.836 --> 00:47:09.136
I finally filled it out.

929
00:47:09.269 --> 00:47:10.571
- Okay, thanks.

930
00:47:10.705 --> 00:47:11.605
- You're welcome.

931
00:47:12.639 --> 00:47:13.908
- This looks fine.

932
00:47:14.041 --> 00:47:15.476
- Okay, great.

933
00:47:16.610 --> 00:47:17.478
Okay.

934
00:47:21.348 --> 00:47:25.552
(employees continue conversing)

935
00:47:31.024 --> 00:47:34.361
(contemplative music)

936
00:47:36.063 --> 00:47:39.032
(mouse clicking)

937
00:47:45.673 --> 00:47:48.609
(seagulls calling)

938
00:47:52.914 --> 00:47:54.214
- I needed a soda.

939
00:47:54.348 --> 00:47:55.783
See this kid saved
this kid, pull him out.


940
00:47:55.917 --> 00:47:58.118
He realizes when he
spits the water out once,


941
00:47:58.252 --> 00:47:59.954
he goes "Father.",
because I was his dad.


942
00:48:00.087 --> 00:48:01.121
- [Emma] His first word.

943
00:48:01.255 --> 00:48:02.556
- Yeah, he goes, "Father."

944
00:48:02.690 --> 00:48:03.624
- [Emma] He hasn't
spoken this whole time.


945
00:48:03.758 --> 00:48:04.625
This is his-

946
00:48:04.759 --> 00:48:05.626
- [Together] First word.

947
00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:07.294
- Bird was his father.

948
00:48:07.427 --> 00:48:08.428
- [Garrett] I'm glad Emma
knows the story, too.


949
00:48:08.562 --> 00:48:09.764
- [Robert] She knows the story.

950
00:48:09.898 --> 00:48:11.231
So I go, "You're my son."

951
00:48:11.365 --> 00:48:12.667
He goes, "I've been your
son, not you're my son.


952
00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:14.067
"I've been living
a life without you.


953
00:48:14.201 --> 00:48:15.536
"We need to find Mom.

954
00:48:15.670 --> 00:48:17.872
"She's been taken to the
Middle East, captured."


955
00:48:18.006 --> 00:48:18.740
- [Emma] Oh yeah, yeah.

956
00:48:18.873 --> 00:48:19.874
- I wouldn't-

957
00:48:20.008 --> 00:48:21.308
- [Emma] It's totally fine.

958
00:48:21.441 --> 00:48:22.175
- I wouldn't put you
in that position.


959
00:48:22.309 --> 00:48:23.577
Does it smell?

960
00:48:23.711 --> 00:48:24.812
- [Emma] No, it's
just a, it, Rob, it's-


961
00:48:24.946 --> 00:48:26.079
- Yeah, it's not good.

962
00:48:26.213 --> 00:48:27.080
- [Emma] Okay, then no.

963
00:48:27.214 --> 00:48:28.783
- [Robert] What's the-

964
00:48:28.917 --> 00:48:30.417
- [Garrett] They smell like
apples; they don't smell bad.


965
00:48:30.551 --> 00:48:32.252
- [Emma] Yeah, it's
the sugar in them.


966
00:48:32.386 --> 00:48:33.688
If you put lemon on
them, they wouldn't turn.


967
00:48:33.821 --> 00:48:35.188
- [Robert] No, I
don't trust them.


968
00:48:35.322 --> 00:48:39.526
(contemplative music continues)

969
00:48:44.431 --> 00:48:45.432
Hey, they deal with you.

970
00:48:45.566 --> 00:48:46.466
- [Emma] You need to go to-

971
00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:47.702
- Yes.

972
00:48:47.835 --> 00:48:49.037
- [Emma] You need
to go to the health,


973
00:48:49.169 --> 00:48:50.170
you need to go to Whole Foods.

974
00:48:50.304 --> 00:48:51.305
- [Garrett] That's perfect.

975
00:48:51.438 --> 00:48:52.406
- Whole Foods, gym, supplements.

976
00:48:52.539 --> 00:48:53.273
- Yeah.
- Supplements.


977
00:48:53.407 --> 00:48:54.274
- [Emma] Yes.

978
00:48:54.408 --> 00:48:55.208
- [Robert] Maybe a GNC.

979
00:48:55.342 --> 00:48:56.209
- Yes.
- Yep.


980
00:48:56.343 --> 00:48:57.210
- [Robert] Work out.

981
00:48:57.344 --> 00:48:58.078
- [Emma] Yes, see?

982
00:48:58.211 --> 00:48:59.681
(copier humming)

983
00:49:07.254 --> 00:49:10.324

00:49:20.100 --> 00:49:22.770

00:49:26.139 --> 00:49:28.141
(seagulls crying)

986
00:49:28.275 --> 00:49:32.279
(Emma and Sophie conversing)

987
00:49:34.581 --> 00:49:36.216
- [Emma] I think they must have.

988
00:49:36.350 --> 00:49:37.085
- Sophie] Did they?

989
00:49:37.217 --> 00:49:38.619
- [Emma] Maybe.

990
00:49:39.353 --> 00:49:42.857
(conversation continues)

991
00:49:42.991 --> 00:49:43.992
- Good night.

992
00:49:44.124 --> 00:49:45.827
Hey, have a good night.

993
00:49:45.960 --> 00:49:46.894
- [Robert] Oh, you too.

994
00:49:47.028 --> 00:49:47.895
- [Isobel] Thank you.

995
00:49:48.029 --> 00:49:48.629
- [Robert] Drive safe.

996
00:49:48.763 --> 00:49:49.831
- Hey.

997
00:49:49.964 --> 00:49:50.832
- Hey.

998
00:49:52.100 --> 00:49:53.467
- Have a good weekend.

999
00:49:54.702 --> 00:49:55.569
- You too.

1000
00:49:56.269 --> 00:49:57.571
- Sorry, sorry.

1001
00:49:59.206 --> 00:50:00.641
Do you have plans tonight?

1002
00:50:02.175 --> 00:50:05.312
(crickets singing)

1003
00:50:12.252 --> 00:50:15.389

(door thudding)

1005
00:50:28.970 --> 00:50:30.237
- Hey, welcome.

1006
00:50:30.370 --> 00:50:31.505
Come on in.

1007
00:50:35.375 --> 00:50:36.911
Want me to grab your jacket?

1008
00:50:43.851 --> 00:50:44.518
- Thanks.

1009
00:50:44.652 --> 00:50:45.585
- Oh, you're welcome.

1010
00:50:49.023 --> 00:50:49.891
I like your sweater.

1011
00:50:50.024 --> 00:50:51.025
- I like your pants.

1012
00:50:51.159 --> 00:50:52.325
- Ah, I just ironed them.

1013
00:50:53.961 --> 00:50:54.996
Malbec.

1014
00:50:55.129 --> 00:50:56.329
She likes Malbec.

1015
00:50:56.463 --> 00:50:57.865
I'll get us some glasses.

1016
00:51:05.039 --> 00:51:07.975
(glasses clinking)

1017
00:51:09.077 --> 00:51:12.780
(wine gurgling and splashing)

1018
00:51:17.852 --> 00:51:18.686
Here you go.

1019
00:51:18.820 --> 00:51:19.619
- Thanks.

1020
00:51:19.754 --> 00:51:21.455
- I'm just gonna start cooking.

1021
00:51:29.831 --> 00:51:32.232
(no audio)

1022
00:51:39.707 --> 00:51:42.777
- You really do
like movies, huh?


1023
00:51:42.910 --> 00:51:45.545
- You think I can
boil pasta in this?


1024
00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:48.415
I guess we're gonna find out.

1025
00:51:48.548 --> 00:51:51.551
(faucet rushing)

1026
00:51:53.221 --> 00:51:55.388
I don't really get a chance
to go to the grocery store,


1027
00:51:55.522 --> 00:52:00.327
but I have this sauce
from before, and
yeah, it looks great.


1028
00:52:00.460 --> 00:52:02.797
But yeah, I don't know
how it's gonna taste.


1029
00:52:02.930 --> 00:52:04.397
You wanna throw on a CD?

1030
00:52:05.265 --> 00:52:06.433
- Which one?

1031
00:52:06.566 --> 00:52:07.835
- Uh, you pick.

1032
00:52:09.137 --> 00:52:12.673
(stove starter clicking)

1033
00:52:19.446 --> 00:52:20.782
Not what I expected.

1034
00:52:21.949 --> 00:52:23.050
I know you haven't
seen that movie.


1035
00:52:23.184 --> 00:52:24.152
- What movie?

1036
00:52:24.284 --> 00:52:25.352
- Exactly.

1037
00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:29.857
Yeah, I know it's old.

1038
00:52:30.658 --> 00:52:31.993
Yeah, it's a classic.

1039
00:52:32.126 --> 00:52:35.129
I think you can put
like four CDs in there.


1040
00:52:35.263 --> 00:52:35.997
- Two, I think.

1041
00:52:36.130 --> 00:52:37.131
- Two?

1042
00:52:37.265 --> 00:52:38.866
- Oh, are they at the back?

1043
00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:39.867
- There.

Ionnalee and Royksopp)

- What's your version
of my movie obsession?


1046
00:52:49.342 --> 00:52:53.681
- Uh, I cook sometimes.

1047
00:52:54.548 --> 00:52:55.883
- What do you like to cook?

1048
00:52:57.450 --> 00:52:58.753

grill out there one day.

And then here, you know,
I'll put these up eventually.

00:53:44.098 --> 00:53:45.066
- Or maybe more.

1099
00:55:29.136 --> 00:55:30.304
- It was good.

1100
00:55:30.438 --> 00:55:31.439
- You hated it.

1101
00:55:31.571 --> 00:55:32.974
- I didn't hate this one.

1102
00:55:34.141 --> 00:55:36.476
- I wonder if there's
a movie you would love.


1103
00:55:36.609 --> 00:55:37.778
- Hmm.

1104
00:55:37.912 --> 00:55:39.714
- Maybe a movie about cooking.

1105
00:55:46.988 --> 00:55:48.923
- Tell me something about you.

1106

1107
00:55:51.624 --> 00:55:53.027
- I don't know.

00:55:55.997 --> 00:55:57.898
What's it like
where you grew up?


1109
00:55:59.499 --> 00:56:01.068
- Crowded.

1110
00:56:01.202 --> 00:56:02.569
Loud.

1111
00:56:02.703 --> 00:56:05.505
So loud it was hard to
hear yourself sometimes.


1112
00:56:05.638 --> 00:56:06.707
But beautiful.

1113
00:56:07.942 --> 00:56:09.276
- Do you like the quiet?

1114
00:56:09.410 --> 00:56:10.277
- I do.

1115
00:56:11.379 --> 00:56:12.880
- Is that why you moved here?

1116
00:56:14.715 --> 00:56:15.783
- In part.

1117
00:56:16.516 --> 00:56:17.818
- Why else?

1118
00:56:17.952 --> 00:56:19.519
- So many questions.

1119
00:56:23.157 --> 00:56:24.091
Got divorced.

1120
00:56:28.062 --> 00:56:29.130
- Oh.

1121
00:56:29.263 --> 00:56:30.798
- It was short.

1122
00:56:32.466 --> 00:56:33.768
- You've been married?

1123
00:56:34.468 --> 00:56:35.535
- Yes.

1124
00:56:38.305 --> 00:56:40.474
- I
-I
-I didn't know that.

1125
00:56:40.607 --> 00:56:45.246
- Yeah, twice actually.

1126
00:56:47.782 --> 00:56:48.849
- [Fran] Oh.

1127
00:56:52.019 --> 00:56:53.888
- First, you know,
when I was young,


1128
00:56:54.021 --> 00:56:57.491
and that was for
a very long time.


1129
00:56:57.624 --> 00:56:58.926
But more recently, you know,

1130
00:56:59.060 --> 00:57:01.896
it just felt better to
move than to stay there.


1131
00:57:08.035 --> 00:57:10.771
I guess I can't seem
to figure it out.


1132
00:57:11.539 --> 00:57:12.639
- Figure what out?

1133
00:57:14.975 --> 00:57:19.579
- Marriage, love, partnership.

1134
00:57:28.489 --> 00:57:29.356
What about you?

1135
00:57:31.425 --> 00:57:32.293
- What about me?

1136
00:57:33.427 --> 00:57:34.995
- Have you ever been in love?

1137
00:57:36.097 --> 00:57:37.231
- Why?

1138
00:57:37.364 --> 00:57:38.332
- I'm just curious.

1139
00:57:41.402 --> 00:57:42.736
- No.

1140
00:57:42.870 --> 00:57:43.971
- Never?
- No.


1141
00:57:45.372 --> 00:57:46.107
- Wow, really?

1142
00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:47.041
I find that-

1143
00:57:47.174 --> 00:57:48.676
- It's not that interesting.

1144
00:57:48.809 --> 00:57:49.677
- But what do you
mean, like love, or-


1145
00:57:49.810 --> 00:57:51.278
- It's not, I, I'm not.

1146
00:57:54.348 --> 00:57:55.216
- Okay.

1147
00:58:03.491 --> 00:58:04.391
It's getting late.

1148
00:58:06.594 --> 00:58:07.661

Well, come in, come in.

1184
01:02:37.131 --> 01:02:38.165
Oh, sorry.

1185
01:02:39.032 --> 01:02:39.768
- I brought this for you.

1186
01:02:39.900 --> 01:02:40.769
It's white.

1187
01:02:40.901 --> 01:02:42.737
- That is so sweet.

1188
01:02:42.871 --> 01:02:44.739
Oh, this is my girl Tellulah.

1189

Tellulah, this is Fran.

1190

- Hey.
- Hey.


1191
01:02:48.041 --> 01:02:49.543
- This fella I believe
you already know.


1192
01:02:49.677 --> 01:02:50.645
- I like your pants.

1193
01:02:50.779 --> 01:02:51.846
- Thank you.

1194
01:02:51.979 --> 01:02:53.715

(guests chattering)

1196
01:02:56.417 --> 01:02:58.820
- Okay, there's barely any left.

1197
01:02:58.952 --> 01:03:02.022
Robert, what the
what? (laughing)


1198
01:03:02.156 --> 01:03:03.157
And Fran!

1199
01:03:03.290 --> 01:03:04.291
- Do you all know each other?

1200
01:03:04.425 --> 01:03:05.492
- Yes-
- We all-


1201
01:03:05.626 --> 01:03:06.627
- The work picnic.

1202
01:03:06.761 --> 01:03:07.628
I'm sorry, this is crazy.

1203
01:03:07.762 --> 01:03:09.096
How do you know Amelia?

1204
01:03:09.229 --> 01:03:10.364
- Oh, they came in for
pie after their movie


1205
01:03:10.497 --> 01:03:11.231
the other night.

1206
01:03:11.365 --> 01:03:12.466
- Pie.

1207
01:03:12.599 --> 01:03:14.034
- Yeah, and I insisted
that they join us.


1208
01:03:14.168 --> 01:03:15.770
- Oh, this is like
a coincidence?


1209
01:03:15.904 --> 01:03:17.204
- We just-

1210
01:03:17.337 --> 01:03:18.572
- Ran into each
other after work.


1211
01:03:18.706 --> 01:03:19.973
- The night of the storm.

1212
01:03:20.107 --> 01:03:21.676
- Yeah, the storm,
and then you had pie.


1213
01:03:21.810 --> 01:03:23.110
- Yeah, it's good.

1214
01:03:23.243 --> 01:03:24.545
You know that chess pie.

1215
01:03:24.679 --> 01:03:25.612
- This is crazy;
I work with them.


1216
01:03:25.747 --> 01:03:26.480
- Hey, hey!

1217
01:03:26.613 --> 01:03:27.916
- Hey, hi!

1218
01:03:28.048 --> 01:03:28.917
- All right, okay,
everyone's here.


1219
01:03:29.049 --> 01:03:30.919
Okay, this is Robert.

1220
01:03:31.051 --> 01:03:32.319
Okay, this is Bennie.

1221
01:03:32.453 --> 01:03:35.924
This is Pauline,
Andrew, this is Yo.


1222
01:03:36.056 --> 01:03:36.891
- [Garrett] Garrett.

1223
01:03:37.024 --> 01:03:37.892
- Garrett.

1224
01:03:38.025 --> 01:03:39.026
You know Garrett.

1225
01:03:39.159 --> 01:03:41.495
Okay, now we're all here.

1226
01:03:41.628 --> 01:03:44.164
So let's play.

1227
01:03:45.065 --> 01:03:45.999
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1228
01:03:46.133 --> 01:03:47.000
(all chattering)

1229
01:03:47.134 --> 01:03:48.001
- Let's go, let's go.

1230
01:03:48.135 --> 01:03:49.002
- It's time to play.

1231
01:03:49.136 --> 01:03:50.137
It's time to play.

1232
01:03:50.270 --> 01:03:52.272
- Welcome, welcome, my family.

1233
01:03:53.340 --> 01:03:56.143
It is I, Handsome Aaron.

1234
01:03:57.645 --> 01:04:00.514
It warms my heart to
see your beautiful faces


1235
01:04:00.648 --> 01:04:02.282
back here at the estate,

1236
01:04:03.417 --> 01:04:07.221
gathered in the
great Beaumont Hall.


1237
01:04:08.422 --> 01:04:12.894
But alas, sisters,
brothers, others.


1238
01:04:13.026 --> 01:04:14.261
(partygoers laughing)

1239
01:04:14.394 --> 01:04:16.563
I have some terrible news.

1240
01:04:17.665 --> 01:04:23.036
I, Handsome Aaron,
have been unexpectedly,


1241
01:04:23.905 --> 01:04:25.539
unjustly, rudely, murdered.

1242
01:04:26.875 --> 01:04:28.442
(startled exclamations
from partygoers)


1243
01:04:28.575 --> 01:04:29.744
- Oh no!
- No!


1244
01:04:29.878 --> 01:04:31.078
(Garrett laughing)

1245
01:04:31.211 --> 01:04:32.279
- Yes, yes.

1246
01:04:33.447 --> 01:04:36.450
Although I look
fleshy and meaty,


1247
01:04:36.583 --> 01:04:40.587
I am but a mere ghost
stuck in the in-between


1248
01:04:40.722 --> 01:04:44.458
on a quest to save the
family and our fortune


1249
01:04:44.591 --> 01:04:48.495
from falling into the
wrong murderous hands.


1250
01:04:48.629 --> 01:04:53.534
Yes, cousins, my murderer
is after our fortune,


1251
01:04:54.702 --> 01:05:00.040
and is here amongst
us in the great hall,


1252
01:05:01.074 --> 01:05:04.746
masquerading as a Beaumont.

1253
01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:06.346
- [Partygoer] No!

1254
01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:07.214
(partygoers exclaiming)

1255
01:05:07.347 --> 01:05:08.683
- Go, go, go!

1256
01:05:08.816 --> 01:05:10.050
- [Bennie] Night has
befallen us, my family,


1257
01:05:10.183 --> 01:05:13.387
so retire to your rooms now.

1258
01:05:16.490 --> 01:05:21.696
Rest your sweet little heads
on your soft satin pillows.


1259
01:05:22.429 --> 01:05:25.566
(guests scuffling)

1260
01:05:25.700 --> 01:05:28.736
Close your sweet
little angel eyes.


1261
01:05:31.371 --> 01:05:34.074
(door creaking)

1262
01:05:34.207 --> 01:05:37.210
(latch clicking)

1263
01:05:43.952 --> 01:05:44.852
Bam!
(guest shrieking)


1264
01:05:44.986 --> 01:05:46.253
(body thudding)

1265
01:05:46.386 --> 01:05:49.757
(doors opening,
footsteps scuffling)


1266
01:05:49.891 --> 01:05:51.859
(guests chattering)

1267
01:05:51.993 --> 01:05:54.294
- [Robert] Oh, shit.

1268
01:05:54.428 --> 01:05:56.597
(Robert whispering)

1269
01:05:56.731 --> 01:05:59.968
- [Bennie] Yo, you
died too young.


1270
01:06:00.100 --> 01:06:01.501
Much too young.

1271
01:06:01.635 --> 01:06:05.773
(guests moaning)
(Bennie laughing)


1272
01:06:05.907 --> 01:06:07.574
Yo, my dear.

1273
01:06:07.709 --> 01:06:09.711
Could you tell us
how this happened?


1274
01:06:09.844 --> 01:06:11.278
- It was terrible.

1275
01:06:11.411 --> 01:06:13.815
A garden hose hanging!

1276
01:06:13.948 --> 01:06:15.315
(guests exclaiming and laughing)

1277
01:06:15.449 --> 01:06:18.285
- [Garrett] Come
on, don't die twice.


1278
01:06:18.418 --> 01:06:19.687
- Horrible.

1279
01:06:19.821 --> 01:06:23.925
Now, who among you
could have done this?


1280
01:06:24.058 --> 01:06:25.158
Was it you?

1281
01:06:25.827 --> 01:06:26.694
- [Guest] No.

1282
01:06:26.828 --> 01:06:27.695
- [Bennie] Maybe you?

1283
01:06:27.829 --> 01:06:28.495
- [Garrett] Amelia.

1284
01:06:28.629 --> 01:06:30.130
- [Amelia] No, come on.

1285
01:06:30.263 --> 01:06:31.933
- [Andrew] What
was that, Robert?


1286
01:06:32.066 --> 01:06:33.634
- Nothing.

1287
01:06:33.768 --> 01:06:36.738
- [Andrew] Ooh, I propose
Robert is the murderer.


1288
01:06:36.871 --> 01:06:38.906
- Oh, I don't know.

1289
01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:42.342
A little fast to
j'accuse there, Andrew.


1290
01:06:42.476 --> 01:06:43.510
- We have to act fast.

1291
01:06:43.645 --> 01:06:44.712
There's a fox in the henhouse.

1292
01:06:44.846 --> 01:06:45.579
- [Amelia] Him?

1293
01:06:45.713 --> 01:06:47.048
- I'm no fox.

1294
01:06:47.180 --> 01:06:48.382
- [Amelia] That's exactly
what a fox would say.


1295
01:06:48.515 --> 01:06:49.516
- No, I wouldn't murder anyone.

1296
01:06:49.651 --> 01:06:50.785
I wouldn't, I wouldn't kill you.

1297
01:06:50.918 --> 01:06:51.919
- [Guest] Thanks.

1298
01:06:52.053 --> 01:06:53.320
- [Robert] I'm a very nice guy.

1299
01:06:53.453 --> 01:06:55.089
And I almost adopted
an orphan once.


1300
01:06:55.222 --> 01:06:56.758
(guests laughing)

1301
01:06:56.891 --> 01:06:59.292
And besides, I was in the
closet the whole time, right?


1302
01:07:00.995 --> 01:07:03.064
- Well, you were in the
closet at the start,


1303
01:07:03.196 --> 01:07:06.466
but when I closed my eyes, I
did hear the floorboard squeak.


1304
01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:08.136
(guests all exclaiming
and laughing)


1305
01:07:08.268 --> 01:07:09.671
- [Garrett] What the what?

1306
01:07:11.171 --> 01:07:15.910
- Robert, our new newest
Beaumont, you have been accused.


1307
01:07:16.878 --> 01:07:17.945
Do we hear any others?

1308
01:07:18.079 --> 01:07:18.946
- I accuse Andrew.

1309
01:07:19.080 --> 01:07:20.380
(guests laughing)

1310
01:07:20.514 --> 01:07:21.548
- [Tellulah] I'm gonna
second that motion.


1311
01:07:21.683 --> 01:07:23.417
He was questionably alone.

1312
01:07:23.550 --> 01:07:27.855
- All right, we have two
accused, Robert and Andrew.


1313
01:07:28.455 --> 01:07:30.091
Now we vote.

1314
01:07:30.223 --> 01:07:31.092
- [Tellulah] Okay.

1315
01:07:31.224 --> 01:07:34.162
- [Bennie] In 3, 2, 1.

1316
01:07:34.294 --> 01:07:35.163
- Boom.

1317
01:07:35.295 --> 01:07:36.164
- [Bennie] Sorry.

1318
01:07:36.296 --> 01:07:37.431
(Tellulah laughing)

1319
01:07:37.564 --> 01:07:39.167
- [Amelia] Oh, wow.

1320
01:07:39.332 --> 01:07:40.835
(guests exclaiming)

1321
01:07:40.968 --> 01:07:42.636
- [Bennie] He must
remove in preparation.


1322
01:07:42.770 --> 01:07:44.038
- [Garrett] The moment before.

1323
01:07:44.172 --> 01:07:47.641
(guests chattering and laughing)

1324
01:07:47.775 --> 01:07:48.442
Chainsaw?

1325
01:07:48.575 --> 01:07:49.911
That's what I thought.

1326
01:07:50.044 --> 01:07:51.145
Chainsaw, oh, but it's
ready, oh, but it's...


1327
01:07:51.278 --> 01:07:52.146
Two words.

1328
01:07:52.279 --> 01:07:53.147
- [Guest] It's a cap.

1329
01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:54.182
It's a cap, two words.

1330
01:07:54.314 --> 01:07:55.116
(guests exclaiming)

1331
01:07:55.248 --> 01:07:56.416
Oh, no!

1332
01:07:56.550 --> 01:07:59.252
(exclaiming continues)

1333
01:07:59.386 --> 01:08:00.220
Oh, I can't watch.

1334
01:08:00.353 --> 01:08:01.288
I can't watch.

1335
01:08:01.421 --> 01:08:02.857
(all chattering)

1336
01:08:02.990 --> 01:08:04.058
- [Garrett] Oh, I see
what you're doing.


1337
01:08:04.192 --> 01:08:05.893
Tied to the stake

1338
01:08:06.027 --> 01:08:07.061
(all exclaiming loudly)

1339
01:08:07.195 --> 01:08:08.261
- Oh, God!

1340
01:08:10.164 --> 01:08:11.598
- Ladies and gentlemen.

1341
01:08:11.733 --> 01:08:13.935
- Oh, my God, rigor mortis.

1342
01:08:14.068 --> 01:08:15.602
(guests chattering and laughing)

1343
01:08:15.737 --> 01:08:17.038
- Oh!
- He's gone.


1344
01:08:17.171 --> 01:08:18.039
- How was that?

1345
01:08:18.172 --> 01:08:19.040
- Nice, nice, nice.

1346
01:08:19.173 --> 01:08:20.174
(guests clapping)

1347
01:08:20.307 --> 01:08:21.608
- [Bennie] Truly spectacular.

1348
01:08:21.743 --> 01:08:22.810
- [Robert] I thought
he was starting a car.


1349
01:08:22.944 --> 01:08:23.643
- [Andrew] Oh, no!

1350
01:08:24.311 --> 01:08:27.514
(footsteps tapping)

1351
01:08:29.183 --> 01:08:31.384
- [Fran] Oh, goddamn it!

1352
01:08:36.924 --> 01:08:40.161
- Thanks for almost throwing
me under the bus back there.


1353
01:08:40.293 --> 01:08:42.230
- I was just being honest.

1354
01:08:42.362 --> 01:08:45.432
(curtain sliding)

1355
01:08:49.670 --> 01:08:51.605
You're good at this.

1356
01:09:01.149 --> 01:09:06.419
- [Bennie] The murderer is
about to silence their kill.


1357
01:09:07.955 --> 01:09:10.758
(door squeaking)

1358
01:09:11.558 --> 01:09:14.762
(footsteps padding)

1359
01:09:17.999 --> 01:09:20.935
(curtain rustling)

1360
01:09:26.007 --> 01:09:29.010
- Uh oh. (gurgling)

1361
01:09:29.877 --> 01:09:31.045
- Fran.

1362
01:09:31.179 --> 01:09:32.814
Fran.

1363
01:09:32.947 --> 01:09:34.514
Fran's dead and I didn't do it.

1364
01:09:34.649 --> 01:09:38.119
(guests running and chattering)

1365
01:09:38.252 --> 01:09:39.754
(light clicking)

1366
01:09:39.887 --> 01:09:41.656
(Amelia gasping)

1367
01:09:41.789 --> 01:09:44.792
- Dearest Fran, the
other newest member


1368
01:09:44.926 --> 01:09:48.029
of the Beaumont family
has been found dead


1369
01:09:48.162 --> 01:09:49.462
in the guest bathroom.

1370
01:09:49.596 --> 01:09:52.800
Tell us, Fran, how did
this abomination happen?


1371
01:09:55.136 --> 01:10:00.340
- Um, it was acid in my stomach.

1372
01:10:03.376 --> 01:10:04.245
- Hmm.

1373
01:10:04.377 --> 01:10:05.279
Acid in the stomach.

1374
01:10:05.412 --> 01:10:07.315
That old chestnut, huh?

1375
01:10:07.447 --> 01:10:11.418
- It was put in my glass
of water before bed,


1376
01:10:13.087 --> 01:10:18.425
coursed down my throat and
singed my stomach lining.


1377
01:10:19.559 --> 01:10:21.028
It felt nice.

1378
01:10:21.162 --> 01:10:26.000
Like hand sanitizer scrubbing
my insides. (rattling)


1379
01:10:28.269 --> 01:10:29.303
- All right.

1380
01:10:29.436 --> 01:10:30.304
(guests applauding)

1381
01:10:30.437 --> 01:10:32.206
(guests chattering)

1382
01:10:32.340 --> 01:10:35.776
What an exceptionally creative
killer we have this evening.


1383
01:10:35.910 --> 01:10:37.477
- This guy's lost
her little claws.


1384
01:10:37.611 --> 01:10:38.646
- Thank you.

1385
01:10:38.779 --> 01:10:40.614
- This is so good.

1386
01:10:40.748 --> 01:10:42.984
- Oh, this is beautiful.

1387
01:10:44.451 --> 01:10:48.890
- And I will hold one for
the very sneaky murderer.


1388
01:10:49.023 --> 01:10:51.524
- Seriously, Garrett,
that was inspired.


1389
01:10:51.659 --> 01:10:52.960
- Yeah, maybe a
little too inspired.


1390
01:10:53.094 --> 01:10:56.097
- That was all part of
the plan, my pretty.


1391
01:10:56.230 --> 01:10:57.497
- [Yo] Right, so I
can't get that low.


1392
01:10:57.631 --> 01:10:59.200
(guests laughing)

1393
01:10:59.333 --> 01:11:00.634
- Saudi people, though.

1394
01:11:01.568 --> 01:11:02.636
- [Garrett] All right, shall we?

1395
01:11:02.770 --> 01:11:04.404
- [Yo] Whoa, look at that go.

1396
01:11:04.537 --> 01:11:05.773
(guests oohing)

1397
01:11:05.907 --> 01:11:06.974
There we go.
- Yes, yes, yeah.


1398
01:11:07.108 --> 01:11:08.709
- [Pauline] Perfect.

1399
01:11:10.044 --> 01:11:11.712
- You know I have
everyone convinced at work


1400
01:11:11.846 --> 01:11:14.015
that I'm a vegetarian.

1401
01:11:14.148 --> 01:11:15.283
Yeah, I don't know why-

1402
01:11:15.415 --> 01:11:16.918
- They're gonna sell you out.

1403
01:11:17.051 --> 01:11:18.252
- You know how when you say
one thing, and everything,


1404
01:11:18.386 --> 01:11:19.186
and what-

1405
01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:20.655
(guests chattering)

1406
01:11:20.788 --> 01:11:22.189
- [Fran] Put your thumb
in and then pull up.


1407
01:11:23.590 --> 01:11:25.293
- [Garrett] Look at
this guy right here.


1408
01:11:25.425 --> 01:11:26.961
- [Amelia] You're my little.

1409
01:11:27.828 --> 01:11:30.031
- [Pauline] Yes, yes, yes.

1410
01:11:30.164 --> 01:11:31.766
- Robert, I'm so sorry.

1411
01:11:31.899 --> 01:11:34.702
Is that your, is this your
first time cracking crab?


1412
01:11:34.835 --> 01:11:35.937
- [Pauline] Is it?

1413
01:11:36.671 --> 01:11:37.805
- It's been a while.

1414
01:11:37.939 --> 01:11:39.173
- You're not from here.

1415
01:11:39.307 --> 01:11:40.308
- Nope.

1416
01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:41.275
- [Pauline] Well, it's violent.

1417
01:11:41.409 --> 01:11:42.475
I like it.

1418
01:11:43.543 --> 01:11:45.179
- [Robert] It's
definitely very violent.


1419
01:11:45.313 --> 01:11:46.180
- [Amelia] What about you, Fran?

1420
01:11:46.314 --> 01:11:47.181
Are you from away?

1421
01:11:48.349 --> 01:11:49.650
- I grew up around here.

1422
01:11:49.784 --> 01:11:51.118
- [Garrett] Really?

1423
01:11:51.252 --> 01:11:52.053
I had no idea.

1424
01:11:52.186 --> 01:11:53.553
Whereabouts?

1425
01:11:53.688 --> 01:11:54.822
- The quiet side.

1426
01:11:55.622 --> 01:11:56.623
- Wow.

1427
01:11:56.757 --> 01:11:58.793
Oh, did you see that?

1428
01:11:58.926 --> 01:12:01.228
- Is the quiet side very quiet?

1429
01:12:01.362 --> 01:12:02.229
- [Garrett] Very.

1430
01:12:03.364 --> 01:12:05.900
- Must've been kinda
lonely out there, Fran.


1431
01:12:06.033 --> 01:12:07.735
- It was great, actually.

1432
01:12:08.836 --> 01:12:10.570
You can just do this.

1433
01:12:11.604 --> 01:12:12.873
- Better prepare.
- Yeah.


1434
01:12:14.641 --> 01:12:16.077
- Claw?
- Mm hm.


1435
01:12:17.912 --> 01:12:19.146
- [Amelia] We're getting
better and better, right?


1436
01:12:21.048 --> 01:12:22.283
- Then you smash
the shit out of it.


1437
01:12:22.416 --> 01:12:23.550
- No, no, come on.

1438
01:12:23.684 --> 01:12:25.219
That's a rookie mistake.

1439
01:12:25.353 --> 01:12:26.954
Don't do it.

1440
01:12:27.088 --> 01:12:28.322
- [Pauline] No, you're just
gonna give it a little wack.


1441
01:12:28.456 --> 01:12:30.958
- [Andrew] Yeah, don't crush it.

1442
01:12:31.926 --> 01:12:33.728
- I was gonna be gentle.

1443
01:12:33.861 --> 01:12:35.463
Just a little hello.

1444
01:12:35.595 --> 01:12:37.164
(guests laughing)

1445
01:12:37.298 --> 01:12:40.500
So I can't really, I mean,
I can't get a hook over.


1446
01:12:40.633 --> 01:12:42.970
- [Garrett] Yeah,
it's all in the wrist.


1447
01:12:44.105 --> 01:12:45.239
- You don't wanna
waste any, so just...


1448
01:12:45.373 --> 01:12:46.506
- [Robert] Just?

1449
01:12:46.639 --> 01:12:47.708
- Gentle.

1450
01:12:48.876 --> 01:12:51.012
- You're secretly good
at a lot of things.


1451
01:12:53.414 --> 01:12:56.150
But you are, you just
don't let anyone know.


1452
01:12:57.218 --> 01:13:00.354
Like, "The acid
coursed down my throat.


1453
01:13:00.488 --> 01:13:02.957
"It singed my insides."

1454
01:13:04.091 --> 01:13:05.960
What the hell is, where
did that come from?


1455
01:13:08.796 --> 01:13:10.530
- I was just playing the game.

1456
01:13:10.664 --> 01:13:12.199
- Come on, that was amazing.

1457
01:13:12.333 --> 01:13:13.334
I had no idea it's in you-

1458
01:13:13.467 --> 01:13:14.702
- It's not that interesting.

1459
01:13:15.870 --> 01:13:17.905
- Oh, like how movies
aren't that interesting?


1460
01:13:18.039 --> 01:13:20.573
Wow, your love life's
not that interesting?


1461
01:13:21.641 --> 01:13:23.344
Okay, so?

1462
01:13:23.477 --> 01:13:24.544
- What?

1463
01:13:25.479 --> 01:13:26.914
- Just curious about you.

1464
01:13:27.982 --> 01:13:29.717
- What do you want from me?

1465
01:13:29.850 --> 01:13:30.718
- [Robert] I don't know.

1466
01:13:30.851 --> 01:13:31.452
Do you have a family?

1467
01:13:31.584 --> 01:13:32.453
- Yes.

1468
01:13:32.585 --> 01:13:33.586
- [Robert] Okay, and?

1469
01:13:34.855 --> 01:13:36.991
- There's not much else to know.

1470
01:13:37.124 --> 01:13:38.292
- Why is this so hard with you?

1471
01:13:38.426 --> 01:13:39.994
- [Fran] You're prying.

1472
01:13:40.127 --> 01:13:42.363
- No, I'm asking questions,
Fran, because I like you.


1473
01:13:42.496 --> 01:13:45.299
I want to get to know you,
but you just won't let me.


1474
01:13:45.433 --> 01:13:46.200
And I don't know what to do.

1475
01:13:46.333 --> 01:13:47.567
It's confusing.

1476
01:13:47.701 --> 01:13:49.670
Like, do you even wanna be here?

1477
01:13:49.804 --> 01:13:51.338
Do you even want to do this?

1478
01:13:52.306 --> 01:13:53.307
Do you even like me?

1479
01:13:54.742 --> 01:13:56.744
Like, tell me what you
want me to do, then.


1480
01:13:56.877 --> 01:13:59.880
'Cause obviously this
isn't, this isn't working.


1481
01:14:00.014 --> 01:14:01.315
Me asking you things.

1482
01:14:01.449 --> 01:14:02.683
- You're exhausting.

1483
01:14:02.817 --> 01:14:04.085
No wonder you
can't stay married.


1484
01:14:10.091 --> 01:14:12.293
(no audio)

1485
01:14:16.530 --> 01:14:17.731
- Please go.

1486
01:14:22.635 --> 01:14:25.906
(door opens, closes)

1487
01:14:28.442 --> 01:14:32.113
(Fran gasping and sobbing)

1488
01:14:40.788 --> 01:14:44.258
(Fran continues crying)

1489
01:14:53.067 --> 01:14:56.704

(espresso machine hissing)

1534
01:22:18.880 --> 01:22:19.747
- [Carol] Fran?

1535
01:22:21.248 --> 01:22:22.382
- [Fran] Carol.

1536
01:22:22.516 --> 01:22:24.786
- Well, what a small world.

1537
01:22:26.286 --> 01:22:28.388
- [Fran] Small town, more like.

1538
01:22:28.522 --> 01:22:31.491
- You have a morning
sweet tooth, too?


1539
01:22:32.860 --> 01:22:35.362
- I was thinking about
getting some for the office.


1540
01:22:36.530 --> 01:22:38.967
- Glazed is a good
place to start.


1541
01:22:39.099 --> 01:22:40.902
Everyone likes glazed.

1542
01:22:41.035 --> 01:22:42.102
- Thanks.

1543
01:22:42.971 --> 01:22:44.338
- Nice of you to do that.

1544
01:22:51.211 --> 01:22:52.080
I miss everyone.

1545
01:22:52.212 --> 01:22:53.180
How, how are they?

1546
01:22:55.415 --> 01:22:56.450
- The same.

1547
01:22:58.786 --> 01:23:01.455
Aren't you supposed to
be on a cruise right now?


1548
01:23:03.357 --> 01:23:06.828
- Uh, well,

1549
01:23:09.063 --> 01:23:10.564
Ted had a stroke.

1550
01:23:19.272 --> 01:23:20.574
- I had no idea-

1551
01:23:20.708 --> 01:23:22.609
- Well, I didn't
say anything, so.


1552
01:23:25.312 --> 01:23:26.613
- I'm so sorry.

1553
01:23:26.748 --> 01:23:27.614
- Thanks.

1554
01:23:29.583 --> 01:23:30.450
- Is he,

1555
01:23:32.954 --> 01:23:33.821
will he?

1556
01:23:35.056 --> 01:23:35.923
- I don't know.

1557
01:23:39.794 --> 01:23:43.698
You know, we planned,
and saved, and waited,


1558
01:23:45.099 --> 01:23:49.302
and everything you're
supposed to do, you know,


1559
01:23:50.470 --> 01:23:53.273
before you go live it
up and savor things.


1560
01:23:53.407 --> 01:23:57.712
And we waited together for that.

1561
01:23:57.845 --> 01:24:01.548
And now, gosh,

1562
01:24:03.885 --> 01:24:07.855
imagine him in the garden,
just some lazy Sunday,


1563
01:24:10.257 --> 01:24:15.462
that was all of those little,

1564
01:24:16.329 --> 01:24:20.168
those were the precious things,

1565
01:24:20.300 --> 01:24:24.939
and I, I just hope...

1566
01:24:27.942 --> 01:24:32.245
But you know,
every day I get up,


1567
01:24:32.379 --> 01:24:33.948
and I see the day out there,

1568
01:24:34.082 --> 01:24:38.019
and I get my coffee, and
I sit here and I think,


1569
01:24:38.152 --> 01:24:41.288
"All right, you know, all right.

1570
01:24:42.790 --> 01:24:45.225
"This is what I have right now."

1571
01:24:45.358 --> 01:24:49.596
And no matter how much better,

1572
01:24:50.564 --> 01:24:52.834
whatever I imagine in my head,

1573
01:24:54.669 --> 01:24:59.841
it's, it's not as real
as what I do have.


1574
01:25:00.574 --> 01:25:04.946
So it's hard, isn't it?

1575
01:25:08.448 --> 01:25:10.685
Being a person.

1576
01:25:17.191 --> 01:25:19.559
(no audio)

1577
01:25:28.368 --> 01:25:31.839
(door clicks and thuds)

1578
01:25:35.342 --> 01:25:36.744
- Mm hm, I appreciate it.

1579
01:25:36.878 --> 01:25:40.081
Yeah, so I've got you
on the 24th, 2:00 p.m.


1580
01:25:40.214 --> 01:25:42.116
Yeah, pier three north.

1581
01:25:42.250 --> 01:25:43.550
Great.

1582
01:25:43.684 --> 01:25:46.386
Yeah, you're gonna be
in slips four and seven.


1583
01:25:46.520 --> 01:25:47.755
(coughing) Okay.

1584
01:25:48.723 --> 01:25:50.158
Yeah, thank you, Steve.

1585
01:25:50.290 --> 01:25:51.159
Appreciate it.

1586
01:25:51.291 --> 01:25:53.961
- Are those donuts?

1587
01:25:54.095 --> 01:25:55.096
- [Emma] Oh my gosh.

1588
01:25:55.229 --> 01:25:56.563
Fran.

1589
01:25:56.697 --> 01:25:58.266
- [Sophie] Oh my God, Fran.

1590
01:25:58.398 --> 01:26:00.467
That is so sweet.

1591
01:26:00.600 --> 01:26:01.501
- So something.

1592
01:26:01.635 --> 01:26:02.469
- I'm gonna get a knife.

1593
01:26:02.602 --> 01:26:04.105
- Oh, you know what?

1594
01:26:04.238 --> 01:26:05.438
I'll grab plates, and
napkins, and all that jazz.


1595
01:26:05.572 --> 01:26:06.573
- [Garrett] Hello, hello, hello.

1596
01:26:06.707 --> 01:26:07.440
- [Sophie] Fran brought donuts.

1597
01:26:07.574 --> 01:26:08.441
- [Garrett] Wow.

1598
01:26:08.575 --> 01:26:09.576
Happy Monday to you.

1599
01:26:09.710 --> 01:26:11.145
- Whoa, those look pretty good.

1600
01:26:11.279 --> 01:26:12.647
- [Sean] What's going on-

1601
01:26:12.780 --> 01:26:13.781
- [Garrett] Rich, don't
eat them all, please.


1602
01:26:13.915 --> 01:26:14.916
- [Sophie] Fran brought donuts.

1603
01:26:15.049 --> 01:26:16.416
(employees chatting)

1604
01:26:16.550 --> 01:26:17.785
- I'm waiting for the
plates and the napkins.


1605
01:26:17.919 --> 01:26:19.053
- [Garrett] Oh,
Sophie's getting them.


1606
01:26:19.187 --> 01:26:20.054
- [Sean] She's getting them.

1607
01:26:20.188 --> 01:26:21.189
- [Garrett] Sure, sure.

1608
01:26:21.321 --> 01:26:22.223
- I could use a napkin, though.

1609
01:26:22.355 --> 01:26:24.058
- Wow.

1610
01:26:24.192 --> 01:26:26.227
- [Garrett] It was really
fun the other night.


1611
01:26:26.359 --> 01:26:27.094
- Yeah, it was.

1612
01:26:27.228 --> 01:26:28.763
- Yeah.

1613
01:26:28.896 --> 01:26:30.097
You know, I've never seen
anyone play that game


1614
01:26:30.231 --> 01:26:31.799
quite like you. (laughing)

1615
01:26:31.933 --> 01:26:34.001
Oh, and everyone said you
have to come back next time.


1616
01:26:34.135 --> 01:26:35.136
- Okay.
- Good.


1617
01:26:35.269 --> 01:26:36.137
- [Sophie] I'm gonna leave this.

1618
01:26:36.270 --> 01:26:37.138
- [Emma] This is better.

1619
01:26:37.271 --> 01:26:38.840
- Well, you know folks,

1620
01:26:38.973 --> 01:26:41.408
I heard that we were supposed
to get a new coffee machine,


1621
01:26:41.541 --> 01:26:43.911
but Isobel axed it
from the budget.


1622
01:26:44.045 --> 01:26:45.046
- Is that true?

1623
01:26:45.179 --> 01:26:45.913
- [Fran] Yeah, it's true.

1624
01:26:46.047 --> 01:26:47.414
(Emma gasping)

1625
01:26:47.547 --> 01:26:48.983
- [Garrett] Well, bless her
little, uh oh, here she comes.


1626
01:26:49.116 --> 01:26:50.117
Here she comes.

1627
01:26:50.251 --> 01:26:51.252
- [Sophie] Do you want some?

1628
01:26:51.384 --> 01:26:52.253
- Uh oh, what's going on?

1629
01:26:52.385 --> 01:26:53.254
What do we have here?

1630
01:26:53.386 --> 01:26:54.121
- [Garrett] I'm cutting.

1631
01:26:54.255 --> 01:26:55.823
- Sweet treats.

1632
01:26:55.957 --> 01:26:57.291
Let me have, let me have,
no, I'm kidding. (laughing)


1633
01:26:57.424 --> 01:26:58.292
That's really nice, Garrett.

1634
01:26:58.425 --> 01:26:59.426
- Oh, Isobel, thank you.

1635
01:26:59.559 --> 01:27:00.695
But actually it was Fran.

1636
01:27:00.828 --> 01:27:02.562
- She is.
- She is?


1637
01:27:02.697 --> 01:27:04.198
- Yeah, she's got a concert
coming up this weekend.


1638
01:27:04.332 --> 01:27:05.632
- Oh, and I have
that meeting later


1639
01:27:05.766 --> 01:27:06.834
if you wanna get the
report on my desk.


1640
01:27:06.968 --> 01:27:07.434
Yeah?

1641
01:27:07.567 --> 01:27:08.803
- Totally.

1642
01:27:08.936 --> 01:27:10.137
- Virtuoso, is that
what they call them?


1643
01:27:10.271 --> 01:27:12.106
- Guys, try not to crash today.

1644
01:27:12.240 --> 01:27:13.107
Try not to crash like last week.

1645
01:27:13.241 --> 01:27:14.208
- Okay.

1646
01:27:14.342 --> 01:27:15.776
- I was totally useless.

1647
01:27:15.910 --> 01:27:17.278
(all chattering)

1648
01:27:17.410 --> 01:27:18.411
- [Garrett] Donuts
win over cake.


1649
01:27:18.545 --> 01:27:19.412
- [Sophie] This one's great.

1650
01:27:19.546 --> 01:27:20.413
- [Emma] Absolutely.

1651
01:27:20.547 --> 01:27:21.849
- [Garrett] Yeah, yeah.

1652
01:27:21.983 --> 01:27:23.050
- [Doug] I dunno, a good
German chocolate cake.


1653
01:27:23.184 --> 01:27:24.417
- [Garrett] Okay, Doug.

1654
01:27:24.551 --> 01:27:25.552
(employees groaning
and laughing)


1655
01:27:25.686 --> 01:27:26.988
(employees continue to chatter)

1656
01:27:27.121 --> 01:27:29.090
Or a carrot cake.

1657
01:27:29.223 --> 01:27:30.224
- [Sophie] Underrated.

1658
01:27:30.358 --> 01:27:31.591
- [Emma] Yeah, 
I just finished.

1659
01:27:31.726 --> 01:27:32.727
- Absolutely.
- It was delicious.


1660
01:27:32.860 --> 01:27:34.362
- [Doug] The whole thing.

1661
01:27:34.494 --> 01:27:35.363
- [Sophie] My cousin had
donuts at her wedding


1662
01:27:35.495 --> 01:27:36.797
instead of cake.

1663
01:27:36.931 --> 01:27:38.299
- [Isobel] Everyone's
eating carrot cake.


1664
01:27:38.431 --> 01:27:40.467
(employees groaning
and laughing)


1665
01:27:40.600 --> 01:27:41.969
- [Garrett] Why are
you holding the plate?


1666
01:27:42.103 --> 01:27:44.138
- [Isobel] Plate
down, plate down.


1667
01:27:44.272 --> 01:27:45.605
- Hey, Robert?

1668
01:27:45.740 --> 01:27:46.741
If you'd like to follow
me to the copy room,


1669
01:27:46.874 --> 01:27:48.709
I have the supplies you ordered.

1670
01:27:48.843 --> 01:27:53.047
(employees continue chattering)

1671
01:28:00.221 --> 01:28:01.055
Hey.

1672
01:28:01.188 --> 01:28:02.056
- Hey.

1673
01:28:03.423 --> 01:28:04.892
- How was the rest
of your weekend?


1674
01:28:06.093 --> 01:28:07.094
- It was all right.

1675
01:28:07.228 --> 01:28:08.495
I watched a couple movies.

1676
01:28:08.628 --> 01:28:09.897
Unpacked a box.

1677
01:28:12.366 --> 01:28:13.433
You?

1678
01:28:14.567 --> 01:28:15.736
- Just lied around.

1679
01:28:20.675 --> 01:28:24.111
I'm sorry for what I said.

1680
01:28:24.245 --> 01:28:25.346
I shouldn't have said that.

1681
01:28:25.478 --> 01:28:27.114
It wasn't my place to say that.

1682
01:28:29.616 --> 01:28:31.185
- [Robert] Thank you.

1683
01:28:31.319 --> 01:28:34.889
You know, I shouldn't have,
I could tell I upset you, so.


1684
01:28:35.022 --> 01:28:35.890
- Okay.

1685
01:28:38.960 --> 01:28:40.895
You know, the more I thought
about that movie we saw,


1686
01:28:41.028 --> 01:28:42.495
the more I think I liked it.

1687
01:28:42.629 --> 01:28:43.698
- [Robert] Yeah?

1688
01:28:44.799 --> 01:28:46.968
I haven't really
thought about it much.


1689
01:28:54.241 --> 01:28:56.643
- Do you wish you
could unknow me?


1690
01:29:01.816 --> 01:29:03.684
- I don't know you.

1691
01:29:14.328 --> 01:29:18.265
- There's a crane I can
see from my cubicle,


1692
01:29:19.467 --> 01:29:21.802
and sometimes I think
about hanging from it.


1693
01:29:23.304 --> 01:29:28.676
Not cause I want to, but because
I wonder how it could feel.


1694
01:29:30.845 --> 01:29:33.714
It's just something I think
about from time to time.
