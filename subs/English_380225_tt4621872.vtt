00:02:26.169 --> 00:02:30.131
LIKE CRAZY

2
00:02:32.425 --> 00:02:34.927
PISTOIA, TUSCANY
MAY 2014


3
00:03:08.169 --> 00:03:11.839
Mauro, did you not see the ladies ?
Shut off the tractor.


4
00:03:12.548 --> 00:03:14.717
The ladies are behind you
with the peat.


5
00:03:14.842 --> 00:03:17.095
- Put it on the cart.
- Thanks.


6
00:03:17.303 --> 00:03:20.056
Sure thing, a little kindness...

7
00:03:26.062 --> 00:03:29.732
Have some decency,
close your legs.


8
00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.373
Moira ! I'll do it.

9
00:03:45.581 --> 00:03:47.250
In line, get in.

10
00:03:47.333 --> 00:03:50.753
No, Giovanna, sit up front
or you'll puke on us.


11
00:03:52.088 --> 00:03:54.716
- Right or left foot first ?
- Right foot.


12
00:03:54.882 --> 00:03:57.009
- Sorry.
- No problem.


13
00:04:00.763 --> 00:04:03.641
- Where are you going ?
- The cosmetics shop.


14
00:04:03.766 --> 00:04:06.519
- Beatrice, be a good girl.
- I need sunscreen...


15
00:04:06.644 --> 00:04:08.980
I'd go alone but I don't drive.

16
00:04:09.147 --> 00:04:12.859
Hands off!
This is no way to win me over...


17
00:04:13.025 --> 00:04:15.153
You're right, Beatrice,
I'm fond of you.


18
00:04:15.361 --> 00:04:16.904
Thanks.

19
00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:19.615
There you are, sweetie !

20
00:04:19.782 --> 00:04:22.785
Come here, my love !

21
00:04:22.994 --> 00:04:25.621
- What do you need today ?
- Sunscreen.


22
00:04:26.164 --> 00:04:29.876
It breaks my heart
having to repeat this every time,


23
00:04:30.042 --> 00:04:32.545
but you know we can't let you out,

24
00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:34.922
you're under restraining orders

25
00:04:35.131 --> 00:04:37.049
and must respect
the therapeutic plan.


26
00:04:37.175 --> 00:04:39.761
I thought you were
smarter than this.


27
00:04:40.303 --> 00:04:42.555
You know I'm the victim
of legal actions


28
00:04:42.764 --> 00:04:47.310
taken by deadbeats interested
in getting their hands on my money.


29
00:04:47.518 --> 00:04:50.062
You have two definitive convictions.

30
00:04:50.188 --> 00:04:53.816
They won the case thanks
to the sectarian Commie judges.


31
00:04:53.941 --> 00:04:55.777
Everyone knows that !

32
00:04:56.027 --> 00:04:58.321
I can relate to
our poor Prime Minister.


33
00:04:58.571 --> 00:05:00.573
- Ex, luckily.
- They all betrayed him.


34
00:05:00.782 --> 00:05:05.161
Even the nuns say he's a pig
but he's an exquisite man.


35
00:05:05.328 --> 00:05:07.330
I went on his yacht in Sardinia

36
00:05:07.705 --> 00:05:09.791
with Pierluigi, as you know...

37
00:05:09.957 --> 00:05:12.084
He's a kind, generous man.

38
00:05:12.293 --> 00:05:15.213
And I won't be silenced,
he's a man who gives and gives.


39
00:05:15.338 --> 00:05:18.341
Listen, I'm fond of you.
Really fond of you.


40
00:05:18.549 --> 00:05:20.051
Really.

41
00:05:20.176 --> 00:05:21.969
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.


42
00:05:22.094 --> 00:05:25.681
But you must learn to get along
with the other guests.


43
00:05:25.848 --> 00:05:28.601
- Meaning ?
- Learn to be accepting of differences.


44
00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:30.228
Try at least.

45
00:05:30.353 --> 00:05:33.439
If you're referring to that nutcase
Moira you placed in my room,


46
00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:36.108
I beg to differ.

47
00:05:36.317 --> 00:05:39.362
You want me to help you
because you're not capable


48
00:05:39.487 --> 00:05:42.240
of handling her
obsessive-compulsive disorders.


49
00:05:42.365 --> 00:05:45.117
But I have other things to do,
I can't.


50
00:05:45.576 --> 00:05:48.496
Would you prefer Annapaola instead ?

51
00:05:49.705 --> 00:05:54.502
But she's in regression...
Do I look like Mother Teresa ?


52
00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:58.256
You would be placing
a huge burden upon <i>me...</i>


53
00:05:58.464 --> 00:06:02.134
How can I take care of Annapaola ?

54
00:06:02.343 --> 00:06:04.637
I reviewed your drug therapy plan,

55
00:06:04.762 --> 00:06:06.848
you're mixing up your meds.

56
00:06:07.014 --> 00:06:09.392
I want to meet you halfway,
darling,


57
00:06:09.892 --> 00:06:12.645
but I cannot give you
your own room.


58
00:06:12.854 --> 00:06:15.398
I cannot allow that.

59
00:06:34.667 --> 00:06:36.919
- Who is it?
- A new girl.


60
00:06:49.932 --> 00:06:53.060
- Luca, how are you ?
- Fine.


61
00:06:53.185 --> 00:06:56.397
Torrigiani from social services.
My colleague, Dr. Luca Moroni.


62
00:06:56.522 --> 00:06:58.941
- Here is her file.
- This is for me.


63
00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:00.651
Welcome.

64
00:07:00.818 --> 00:07:02.528
How are you ?

65
00:07:02.695 --> 00:07:05.448
- She has a brace but can walk.
- Are you sure ?


66
00:07:05.823 --> 00:07:07.700
Nice and slow.

67
00:07:07.783 --> 00:07:09.285
- Thanks, sorry.
- No worries.


68
00:07:09.452 --> 00:07:12.914
Isn't this a lovely place ?
Like it?


69
00:07:12.955 --> 00:07:14.832
- Thanks.
- How was the ride ?


70
00:07:14.957 --> 00:07:16.834
You'll be fine here.

71
00:07:18.461 --> 00:07:20.338
We had to sedate her.

72
00:07:21.797 --> 00:07:23.716
Luisanna, the head nurse.

73
00:07:23.841 --> 00:07:26.302
Morning, I'll go make up the bed.

74
00:07:27.219 --> 00:07:28.846
Suicide attempt in detention ?

75
00:07:29.055 --> 00:07:31.098
Mind your fucking business.

76
00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:35.102
Such elegant reserve
on behalf of the staff.


77
00:07:35.311 --> 00:07:37.480
I'll hold this while you do the stairs.

78
00:07:37.605 --> 00:07:40.316
- Thanks.
- Need a hand ?


79
00:08:19.105 --> 00:08:21.732
Bad girl,
you mustn't do things like this !


80
00:08:21.899 --> 00:08:25.277
You're all my guests,
my family donated this villa !


81
00:08:25.486 --> 00:08:27.905
- Yes, I know...
- Show some respect.


82
00:08:28.155 --> 00:08:31.158
You shouldn't look
at other patients' files !


83
00:08:31.283 --> 00:08:35.746
- This is my home, understand ?
- Calm down.


84
00:08:35.788 --> 00:08:37.665
I'm too democratic...

85
00:08:37.873 --> 00:08:42.253
- Don't be mean, Beatrice !
- You ugly paupers...


86
00:08:55.808 --> 00:08:58.436
Excuse me, are you the doctor ?

87
00:09:02.398 --> 00:09:06.444
- Yes.
- I was told to wait here for you.


88
00:09:06.694 --> 00:09:09.030
- Of course...
- Sorry.


89
00:09:12.783 --> 00:09:15.161
- Thanks.
- No need to get up.


90
00:09:16.537 --> 00:09:18.914
Donatella Morelli, correct?

91
00:09:23.544 --> 00:09:26.839
- What happened to your leg ?
- I fell down the stairs.


92
00:09:27.798 --> 00:09:30.551
- Fell or threw yourself down ?
- Fell.


93
00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:35.347
Drug use ?

94
00:09:36.348 --> 00:09:37.850
Heroin, cocaine ?

95
00:09:38.059 --> 00:09:42.229
Hash ? MDM... that stuff
people use nowadays...


96
00:09:42.354 --> 00:09:45.608
- That makes you kiss everyone.
- Me ? No.


97
00:09:47.735 --> 00:09:51.238
Very well, let's check
your blood pressure.


98
00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:54.575
- Blood pressure ?
- Yes.


99
00:10:01.999 --> 00:10:05.127
I don't have
your drug therapy plan here


100
00:10:05.336 --> 00:10:09.757
but judging by your thinness,
you're not taking neuroleptics.


101
00:10:10.132 --> 00:10:12.510
Promazine, 30 mg.

102
00:10:15.346 --> 00:10:18.641
Anorectic depressogenic side effects.

103
00:10:19.016 --> 00:10:21.477
Any lithium ?

104
00:10:21.602 --> 00:10:23.604
Citalopram, 40 mg.

105
00:10:23.771 --> 00:10:28.526
30-40 drops alternated with Promazine
depending on the doctor.


106
00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:31.779
What a disaster !

107
00:10:33.906 --> 00:10:36.784
All right, benzodiazepine... obviously.

108
00:10:37.034 --> 00:10:40.788
<i>2</i> mg of Valium three times a day.

109
00:10:40.913 --> 00:10:43.916
30-40 drops of clorazepam
before bed.


110
00:10:44.125 --> 00:10:49.296
I love that stuff.
I take an antipsychotic, Haloperidol.


111
00:10:50.506 --> 00:10:54.135
It made me fat,
gave me a real belly...

112
00:10:57.054 --> 00:10:59.807
I'm kidding,
just trying to break the ice !


113
00:11:02.643 --> 00:11:04.562
I fell for it, doc.

114
00:11:05.563 --> 00:11:09.275
- May I ask you a question ?
- Of course.


115
00:11:10.526 --> 00:11:13.779
I sent a request
to the tutelary judge.


116
00:11:13.904 --> 00:11:16.073
A written request...

117
00:11:16.824 --> 00:11:20.161
Over a year ago,
but I never got a reply.


118
00:11:20.327 --> 00:11:23.038
Do you think I should resubmit it?

119
00:11:23.205 --> 00:11:26.083
Well, depends on what your request was.

120
00:11:26.959 --> 00:11:30.588
Maybe I wrote it shoddily.
Will you help me ?


121
00:11:30.838 --> 00:11:33.966
Certainly.
The nature of your request ?


122
00:11:34.717 --> 00:11:36.552
I'd like a photo at least.

123
00:11:37.553 --> 00:11:40.598
A photo <i>of...</i>

124
00:11:42.433 --> 00:11:44.435
Of Elia !

125
00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:46.604
Of Elia ?

126
00:11:50.482 --> 00:11:52.234
Your son ?

127
00:11:55.696 --> 00:11:57.740
All right, ready.

128
00:11:59.241 --> 00:12:02.745
It's off...
they always turn everything off.


129
00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:06.332
Move around my things...
it's so bothersome.


130
00:12:06.498 --> 00:12:10.586
Beatrice, we agreed you'd go
socialize in the tea corner.


131
00:12:10.753 --> 00:12:12.963
- Go on.
- I'm socializing here.


132
00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:15.633
No, you're meddling.
Come on !


133
00:12:15.841 --> 00:12:19.011
Sorry I'm late,
I was looking at your file.


134
00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:20.971
I can still help you.

135
00:12:21.222 --> 00:12:26.143
Miss Morelli, good morning.
I'm Torrigiani, your social worker.


136
00:12:26.268 --> 00:12:29.021
- I'd take her off neuroleptics.
- Thanks.


137
00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:31.357
Don't flub things up.

138
00:12:31.482 --> 00:12:33.651
- Is this everything ?
- My flashlight...


139
00:12:33.859 --> 00:12:38.530
It's here. Flashlight, cell phone,
headphones.


140
00:12:41.158 --> 00:12:43.369
Meal time !

141
00:12:44.161 --> 00:12:46.664
Grub's ready, girls,
to the dining hall.


142
00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:51.919
- Wonder what the chef made.
- Something yummy.


143
00:12:52.127 --> 00:12:55.256
You've been holed up in here
since you arrived...


144
00:12:55.798 --> 00:12:58.634
Come eat in the dining hall
with the others.


145
00:12:58.759 --> 00:13:01.679
- Need help ?
- No, I can manage alone.


146
00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:06.308
You finally came,
after hiding out in your room.


147
00:13:06.517 --> 00:13:08.811
Thanks, sorry.

148
00:13:17.194 --> 00:13:19.446
Protein, you could use some.

149
00:13:19.697 --> 00:13:24.285
I'm grazing today, like a goat.
I've gone up a size.


150
00:13:26.412 --> 00:13:30.666
I bust the zipper on a Dior dress
that looked smashing on me.


151
00:13:30.833 --> 00:13:33.585
If you want you can try it on.

152
00:13:34.586 --> 00:13:36.547
I have a bunch of things
you could try,


153
00:13:36.714 --> 00:13:40.467
by my designer friend
who works in Milan and New York.


154
00:13:40.592 --> 00:13:43.429
Short dresses, lovely but short.

155
00:13:44.221 --> 00:13:48.600
I can still show my legs
but I'm nearing my twilight.


156
00:13:48.809 --> 00:13:52.604
But you're so young and pretty

157
00:13:53.439 --> 00:13:55.316
Maybe nobody's
told you that before.


158
00:13:56.108 --> 00:13:58.986
Pity you disfigured yourself
with these grotesque tattoos.


159
00:13:59.236 --> 00:14:02.948
What on earth were you thinking ?
What a mess.


160
00:14:05.242 --> 00:14:09.330
- What do you want from me ?
- Nothing, I like you.


161
00:14:09.371 --> 00:14:14.084
I don't like you.
Go sit somewhere else. Thanks.


162
00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:20.758
They should've turned
Villa Biondi into a luxury resort


163
00:14:20.883 --> 00:14:23.719
instead of donating it
for the public good.


164
00:14:23.844 --> 00:14:27.598
A fancy spa
with Ayurvedic massages,


165
00:14:27.765 --> 00:14:30.392
high-class guests, drinks at 7:00...

166
00:14:31.018 --> 00:14:32.895
Laugh away...

167
00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:36.774
The world's made up of people
who want to be sad, the majority,


168
00:14:36.982 --> 00:14:38.734
and have no desire to work,

169
00:14:38.901 --> 00:14:42.780
and those who want to be happy.
like me, I am happy.


170
00:14:47.284 --> 00:14:50.871
My husband
is attorney Pierluigi Aitiani,


171
00:14:51.038 --> 00:14:55.167
you might've heard of him on TV,
the PM was his client.


172
00:14:55.376 --> 00:14:59.254
- He's a genius.
- Who gives a shit about your husband.


173
00:14:59.421 --> 00:15:01.799
You're rude and foolish too.

174
00:15:02.007 --> 00:15:05.302
What you need is a good attorney.

175
00:15:06.929 --> 00:15:08.889
I understood it right away.

176
00:15:21.777 --> 00:15:24.029
- Not coming to mass ?
- Who, me ?


177
00:15:24.071 --> 00:15:25.948
It's a blast.

178
00:15:26.073 --> 00:15:28.575
There's a hot priest,
African but sexy. Come on.


179
00:15:29.076 --> 00:15:34.039
I'll lend you something,
I have the perfect miniskirt for you.


180
00:15:40.671 --> 00:15:42.548
Come take Communion.

181
00:15:56.478 --> 00:15:58.355
Don't we have to confess before ?

182
00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:00.732
No need to confess.
Stand up straight.


183
00:16:12.327 --> 00:16:13.829
The Body of Christ.

184
00:16:40.772 --> 00:16:43.400
See how he looked at me ?

185
00:16:43.525 --> 00:16:45.527
- Who ?
- The priest.


186
00:16:45.611 --> 00:16:47.529
With all due modesty...

187
00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:53.160
I told Luisanna to put you in my room
so we can chat.


188
00:16:55.537 --> 00:16:56.997
<i>Go on...</i>

189
00:16:57.664 --> 00:17:00.626
Excuse me.

190
00:17:03.795 --> 00:17:07.257
Step in the center of every
second tile, avoid the cracks.


191
00:17:07.424 --> 00:17:10.928
Basola, with those big feet
you'll have to take off your shoes.


192
00:17:12.554 --> 00:17:16.308
- No, I explained the rules to you.
- Take off your shoes.


193
00:17:16.433 --> 00:17:19.520
You shouldn't indulge her,
you should set boundaries.


194
00:17:19.686 --> 00:17:23.941
There's a chapter about OCD
in the DSM-4.


195
00:17:24.066 --> 00:17:25.943
Beatrice, thanks so much.

196
00:17:26.944 --> 00:17:31.823
Shut up, she never stops talking,
not even in her sleep !


197
00:17:31.949 --> 00:17:34.785
- Honey, I'll make up the bed after.
- Thanks.


198
00:17:34.952 --> 00:17:37.955
I freed up some closet space for you.

199
00:17:38.038 --> 00:17:41.166
Wooden hangers
are for winter apparel,


200
00:17:41.208 --> 00:17:44.586
the others are for skirts and pants.

201
00:17:44.711 --> 00:17:47.965
Half of this space
is for your creams and perfumes.


202
00:17:48.090 --> 00:17:50.342
If you need a glass...

203
00:17:52.719 --> 00:17:54.429
Is that all ?

204
00:17:55.806 --> 00:17:57.599
I realize you're depressed,

205
00:17:57.683 --> 00:18:01.603
but I hope you've brought
a nightgown at least ?


206
00:18:01.728 --> 00:18:04.690
Otherwise it'll be problematic
having you here.


207
00:18:04.731 --> 00:18:06.733
This is all I have.

208
00:18:10.696 --> 00:18:13.240
Well good thing you have <i>me...</i>

209
00:18:13.365 --> 00:18:15.617
good thing you have <i>me...</i>

210
00:18:16.743 --> 00:18:18.620
Try this on.

211
00:18:21.498 --> 00:18:23.250
Stand up straight.

212
00:18:29.965 --> 00:18:31.967
- Good night.
- Good night.


213
00:18:41.268 --> 00:18:43.270
Everyone's asleep in here.

214
00:18:56.533 --> 00:19:00.162
- Good night, Beatrice.
- Thanks, close it please.


215
00:19:18.263 --> 00:19:20.432
"Judge Lo Monaco"

216
00:19:27.397 --> 00:19:29.316
<i>Ma'am, I was sleeping.</i>

217
00:19:29.441 --> 00:19:33.445
Sleeping ? Too bad...
I can't even sleep a wink,


218
00:19:34.696 --> 00:19:38.283
because I'm still in custody
thanks to your incompetent verdict.


219
00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:43.038
Mitigated, my foot,
they won't even let <i>me...</i>


220
00:19:44.331 --> 00:19:46.333
go to the hairdresser's.

221
00:19:46.458 --> 00:19:48.710
Oh please, give me a break.

222
00:19:48.835 --> 00:19:52.464
Go review the article in question

223
00:19:52.547 --> 00:19:54.925
if you haven't ever done so.

224
00:19:54.966 --> 00:19:57.594
You illiterate brute !

225
00:19:58.970 --> 00:20:02.224
Report me ? I'll report you.

226
00:20:02.307 --> 00:20:07.854
I'll drag you before
the board of Magistrates.


227
00:20:07.938 --> 00:20:11.358
I'll pay someone to kill you !

228
00:20:11.483 --> 00:20:13.110
Do you understand me ?

229
00:20:13.235 --> 00:20:15.112
That's my phone !

230
00:20:15.237 --> 00:20:17.739
You called the judge again,
at 2:15 in the morning.


231
00:20:19.199 --> 00:20:21.576
He already pressed charges
for stalking.


232
00:20:21.618 --> 00:20:23.620
- I'm taking this.
- No.


233
00:20:23.745 --> 00:20:26.998
You'll regret this abuse of power !

234
00:20:27.124 --> 00:20:29.626
Now go beddy-bye.

235
00:20:30.877 --> 00:20:33.839
Nobody listens to my advice,
too bad for you all !


236
00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:36.133
Use mine.

237
00:20:36.258 --> 00:20:39.469
Not sure I have any minutes left,
I just use it for music.


238
00:20:43.515 --> 00:20:46.393
You don't make calls
or send messages ?


239
00:20:48.854 --> 00:20:50.647
That's horrible.

240
00:21:04.995 --> 00:21:07.247
"To dad:
I don't feel well, can we talk ?"


241
00:21:08.665 --> 00:21:11.501
"To dad: sorry to bother you,
can we talk ?"


242
00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:15.565
She's rummaging through
Morelli's stuff !


243
00:22:16.733 --> 00:22:20.237
- Anything interesting ?
- Ever heard of the word "privacy" ?


244
00:22:25.367 --> 00:22:28.370
"Uzzano, Tuscany:
hundreds seek out clairvoyant"


245
00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:32.833
Linda, no,
you'll destroy the inflorescence !


246
00:22:32.999 --> 00:22:37.003
- I'm no good at anything.
- Quit being dramatic.


247
00:22:38.713 --> 00:22:43.635
So I'm at the Royal Palace for the G7
with Pierluigi and the PM,


248
00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:45.846
when suddenly Renato shows up,

249
00:22:46.012 --> 00:22:48.974
he and I had just spent
a steamy summer together...


250
00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:52.018
He shows up
in the lobby of the hotel...


251
00:22:52.227 --> 00:22:54.771
No, what are you doing ?

252
00:22:54.896 --> 00:23:00.026
Put the lavender under the gazebo
where there's more shade.


253
00:23:00.235 --> 00:23:03.280
Giovanna, make sure
to add water to the substrate.


254
00:23:03.488 --> 00:23:07.659
- So it compacts.
- But then it'll weigh twice as much.


255
00:23:07.784 --> 00:23:10.287
Just make a few more trips.

256
00:23:10.495 --> 00:23:14.541
You could stand to lose some weight,
lazybones.


257
00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:20.672
So I was at dinner with them,
Bill Clinton was there too...


258
00:23:20.797 --> 00:23:22.799
He was very friendly...

259
00:23:22.924 --> 00:23:25.927
Hilary's a bitch, but he's a doll.

260
00:23:26.678 --> 00:23:30.682
But I couldn't wait to get out of there.
All I could think about was Renato.


261
00:23:31.016 --> 00:23:34.269
We used to make love
all over the place,


262
00:23:34.561 --> 00:23:37.063
in the car of course, at the movies...

263
00:23:38.565 --> 00:23:40.275
Once we even did it in church.

264
00:23:40.442 --> 00:23:44.070
There was intense Eros between us,
so mysterious.


265
00:23:44.279 --> 00:23:48.074
Renato is no intellectual
but he's an amazing lover,


266
00:23:48.325 --> 00:23:50.327
quite imaginative...

267
00:23:52.662 --> 00:23:54.456
Am I boring you ?

268
00:23:54.664 --> 00:23:58.418
Darn, this broke off.
Shall I take it to the kitchen ?


269
00:23:59.210 --> 00:24:02.088
Are you listening to music ?

270
00:24:02.297 --> 00:24:05.342
If you're not interested in my stories,
just say so.


271
00:24:05.467 --> 00:24:09.554
- I was listening to you...
- I can't stand hypocrisy.


272
00:24:09.721 --> 00:24:12.557
- I am interested.
- No.


273
00:24:12.724 --> 00:24:15.852
- I was listening to you.
- What a horrible thing to do.


274
00:24:15.977 --> 00:24:18.480
What was his name ? Luciano ?

275
00:24:18.688 --> 00:24:22.067
No, Renato.
I've got nothing left to say.


276
00:24:22.233 --> 00:24:24.486
- Horrible !
- Sorry.


277
00:24:24.694 --> 00:24:28.114
- You really are an awful person.
- I'm sorry.


278
00:24:29.991 --> 00:24:32.327
I got confused.

279
00:24:32.494 --> 00:24:37.123
The city nursery is looking for
two more patients to work part-time.


280
00:24:37.374 --> 00:24:41.503
But they want someone
who has experience with herbs.


281
00:24:41.878 --> 00:24:44.965
How's the new girl hacking it,
that Morelli ?


282
00:24:45.131 --> 00:24:46.508
Not bad.

283
00:24:46.633 --> 00:24:49.636
She and Beatrice together
make one good worker.


284
00:24:49.844 --> 00:24:52.263
Yeah, one works and the other talks...

285
00:24:52.389 --> 00:24:55.600
When it comes to plants
she knows what she's saying.


286
00:24:55.767 --> 00:24:58.645
A bit of a slacker
but knowledgeable.


287
00:24:58.770 --> 00:25:00.855
Do you think they're ready to go out?

288
00:25:01.022 --> 00:25:05.402
Beatrice's subjecting Donatella
to a sort of love bombing,


289
00:25:06.277 --> 00:25:08.655
she basically stormed her.

290
00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:13.034
It seems the relationship
is doing them both a lot of good.


291
00:25:13.243 --> 00:25:16.287
I'm in favor
of them going out together.


292
00:25:16.413 --> 00:25:19.165
You're being rather Pollyannaish,

293
00:25:19.374 --> 00:25:23.169
this is still Donatella Morelli
who committed a serious crime,


294
00:25:23.378 --> 00:25:25.422
and is a likely recidivist.

295
00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:27.298
This isn't jail.

296
00:25:27.424 --> 00:25:30.051
We aim to help people change.

297
00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:34.055
As Sister Pia says, we're sinners
but God treats us like children


298
00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:36.016
so we may become his children.

299
00:25:36.182 --> 00:25:38.309
So true !

300
00:25:38.518 --> 00:25:42.689
I'd take it slow, someone
with a record like Beatrice's...


301
00:25:43.690 --> 00:25:45.817
episodes of violence,

302
00:25:46.026 --> 00:25:49.946
she inflicted harm on a poor soul...
let's take it slow !


303
00:25:50.071 --> 00:25:54.576
The poor lady was distraught,
she'd argued with her Renato !


304
00:25:54.826 --> 00:25:59.456
"Her" Renato is
a notorious professional criminal.


305
00:25:59.581 --> 00:26:03.835
His relationship with
Beatrice Morandini was dangerous


306
00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:06.546
and led him to another serious charge.

307
00:26:06.713 --> 00:26:08.715
My vocation doesn't allow it,

308
00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:12.677
but you must've felt
the felt pangs of jealousy in life.


309
00:26:12.844 --> 00:26:15.221
This isn't a personal matter,
Sister Pia.


310
00:26:15.430 --> 00:26:20.935
Then we'll let Beatrice go out alone,
so we can get a break !


311
00:26:21.102 --> 00:26:24.856
Luisanna, that's not for you
or Sister Pia to decide.


312
00:26:24.981 --> 00:26:27.859
The judge will have the last word.

313
00:26:28.068 --> 00:26:31.738
Sir, are you ready to accept
full responsibility for this ?


314
00:26:33.948 --> 00:26:36.993
Shall I call them ? 
I'll call them.

315
00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:52.217
- Wait for us !
- Beatrice, get in.


316
00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:55.762
- I still don't agree.
- Why ?


317
00:26:56.221 --> 00:26:57.722
Bye !

318
00:27:06.481 --> 00:27:08.900
- Put it inside.
- Now ?


319
00:27:10.026 --> 00:27:12.612
- It's so fast !
- Leave some space.


320
00:27:13.363 --> 00:27:15.031
Fill two, leave one.

321
00:27:36.928 --> 00:27:39.681
You should see how he looks at me.
Watch.


322
00:27:41.266 --> 00:27:42.684
<i>Watch...</i>

323
00:27:43.434 --> 00:27:45.186
He didn't look at you.

324
00:27:46.771 --> 00:27:48.815
He's really infatuated,

325
00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:52.318
I brushed him off
so he doesn't get his hopes up.


326
00:27:52.527 --> 00:27:56.698
If you think about Madonna
and Demi Moore...


327
00:27:56.823 --> 00:27:58.575
- Beatrice, hello.
- Hi, Giancarlo.


328
00:27:58.783 --> 00:28:02.704
...with their younger boyfriends,
I find it pathetic.


329
00:28:03.079 --> 00:28:06.291
Shut off the camera.
I know someone's there.


330
00:28:06.457 --> 00:28:08.334
- What camera ?
- Shut it off.


331
00:28:08.543 --> 00:28:10.712
- It's not a camera.
- Right there.


332
00:28:11.212 --> 00:28:13.715
- Stay away or I'll hurt myself!
- Basola I


333
00:28:15.466 --> 00:28:18.052
I'm not stupid, you know !

334
00:28:18.219 --> 00:28:20.972
Giovanna, put that knife down !

335
00:28:21.097 --> 00:28:22.849
Please, Giovanna.

336
00:28:24.976 --> 00:28:26.352
Behave!

337
00:28:26.603 --> 00:28:28.354
Turn the light on.

338
00:28:30.857 --> 00:28:34.319
Liliana mans the pump,
Daniela holds the jug as usual.


339
00:28:34.485 --> 00:28:38.239
- Let's get some Sangiovese !
- No, I want sweet wine !


340
00:28:38.698 --> 00:28:40.491
We'll celebrate mass !

341
00:28:40.617 --> 00:28:42.869
A special mass !

342
00:28:44.746 --> 00:28:46.831
Hurry UP-

343
00:28:46.998 --> 00:28:49.000
To the infirmary, guys.

344
00:28:49.209 --> 00:28:51.961
I don't want to
go to the infirmary !

345
00:28:52.212 --> 00:28:54.714
- Stay calm.
- I don't want to !


346
00:29:01.095 --> 00:29:02.013
<i>Come on...</i>

347
00:29:02.138 --> 00:29:04.140
- Calm down.
- No !


348
00:29:07.894 --> 00:29:10.605
Girls, go to bed
She's fine.


349
00:29:11.981 --> 00:29:15.902
I don't want to sleep.
You hate <i>me...</i> yes.


350
00:29:16.277 --> 00:29:18.154
Cristiana, your meds.

351
00:29:18.363 --> 00:29:20.907
- Yours too, Annapaola.
- Thanks.


352
00:29:21.032 --> 00:29:24.035
- Do you have water for your pills ?
- Yes.


353
00:29:26.913 --> 00:29:29.249
Everyone hit the hay now.

354
00:29:32.502 --> 00:29:34.921
- 5 mg.
- Double spritz.


355
00:29:37.298 --> 00:29:39.300
- Smells divine.
- Must cost a fortune.


356
00:29:39.425 --> 00:29:44.180
It's not sold in Italy, but give me
your Seropram and you can have some.


357
00:29:44.931 --> 00:29:47.642
Now you can relax.

358
00:29:48.184 --> 00:29:51.521
Good girl, Giovanna, relax now.

359
00:29:51.771 --> 00:29:54.065
- The Body of Christ.
- Amen.


360
00:29:54.565 --> 00:29:56.651
- The Blood of Christ.
- Amen.


361
00:30:06.536 --> 00:30:09.330
- Serena Pagni.
- Sign here.


362
00:30:11.082 --> 00:30:13.334
Moira Michelotti with two Ts.

363
00:30:13.459 --> 00:30:16.546
- Your John Hancock.
- Thanks, good day.


364
00:30:17.088 --> 00:30:19.841
- Donatella Morelli...
- Sign.


365
00:30:20.967 --> 00:30:23.678
- That's 120 euros.
- Thank you.


366
00:30:24.178 --> 00:30:27.098
- Hello, Morandini Valdirana.
- Sign.


367
00:30:30.435 --> 00:30:31.853
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.


368
00:30:31.978 --> 00:30:34.230
Cigarette money.

369
00:30:34.355 --> 00:30:37.066
Beatrice, it's 120 euros !

370
00:30:41.070 --> 00:30:43.239
Where's the minibus ?

371
00:30:43.489 --> 00:30:46.200
The minibus should've been here

372
00:30:46.367 --> 00:30:48.745
- 30, 31
- Did they forget us ?


373
00:30:50.371 --> 00:30:52.498
- Are you sure ?
- Yes.


374
00:30:53.708 --> 00:30:56.127
I'm getting anxious,
what if they leave us here ?


375
00:30:56.461 --> 00:30:58.755
Come back, it's dangerous !

376
00:30:58.963 --> 00:31:01.591
We'll hitch a ride.

377
00:31:02.759 --> 00:31:05.094
- All 10 of us ?
- No, it's not scheduled.


378
00:31:05.261 --> 00:31:08.514
- I've never hitchhiked.
- I'm afraid of hitchhiking.


379
00:31:08.723 --> 00:31:10.141
There's a bus !

380
00:31:10.266 --> 00:31:14.729
We're gonna take just any bus ?
What number is it?


381
00:31:14.854 --> 00:31:16.773
63, come on !

382
00:31:17.106 --> 00:31:19.901
No, not the 63 !

383
00:31:20.276 --> 00:31:22.612
- Come on !
- No, don't !


384
00:31:22.904 --> 00:31:26.032
Six plus three is nine, we can't !

385
00:31:26.407 --> 00:31:29.285
- Donatella, come back !
- Thank you !


386
00:31:32.538 --> 00:31:34.165
Come with us !

387
00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:37.001
Come on !

388
00:31:37.293 --> 00:31:40.004
- How kind.
- I'm afraid !


389
00:31:40.254 --> 00:31:43.549
- Don't get on !
- Get back here !


390
00:31:46.552 --> 00:31:48.304
Thanks.
Why not come ?


391
00:31:48.429 --> 00:31:50.390
Get back here !

392
00:31:52.308 --> 00:31:53.935
To Villa Biondi, please.

393
00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:55.812
Turn around,

394
00:31:56.020 --> 00:31:59.315
take a right at Ponzano,
you can't miss it, thanks.


395
00:31:59.565 --> 00:32:03.319
Lady, we're going
to the end of the line.


396
00:32:03.778 --> 00:32:06.030
And where is that ?

397
00:32:06.531 --> 00:32:09.951
If it's the end of the line,
there'll be other buses.


398
00:32:10.785 --> 00:32:12.954
Tickets ? Obviously not...

399
00:32:13.079 --> 00:32:16.457
Spontaneousness is
always imprisoned by regulations.


400
00:32:16.666 --> 00:32:19.919
We've got cash, we're not refugees
you know.


401
00:32:22.588 --> 00:32:25.299
- We should've bought tickets.
- Oh well...


402
00:32:25.466 --> 00:32:27.802
- We have money.
- Oh well...


403
00:32:41.107 --> 00:32:44.110
- Where are Donatella and Beatrice ?
- On the 63 !


404
00:32:44.235 --> 00:32:47.697
I told them to not do it
but they wouldn't listen.


405
00:32:49.574 --> 00:32:52.994
- Sweet Jesus.
- Get in and we'll go find them.


406
00:32:53.202 --> 00:32:57.874
Sweet Mother of Jesus...
and of those two !


407
00:33:01.836 --> 00:33:04.005
I don't see any buses, let's ask.

408
00:33:04.213 --> 00:33:08.259
Why don't we have a drink ?
Some green tea <i>or...</i>


409
00:33:08.384 --> 00:33:10.136
- All right.
- Organic juice.


410
00:33:10.344 --> 00:33:13.264
I wouldn't mind a beer. 
Hold <i>on...</i>

411
00:33:25.401 --> 00:33:27.528
Look, there's Luisanna.

412
00:33:41.501 --> 00:33:43.169
Sorry.

413
00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:47.006
Let's go shopping, we have money.

414
00:33:47.548 --> 00:33:51.886
What lousy stores though,
Italy really is in decline.


415
00:33:52.011 --> 00:33:55.932
What are these jobless people
doing here ?


416
00:33:56.057 --> 00:33:57.767
Sweetie !

417
00:33:58.309 --> 00:33:59.936
A lingerie store.

418
00:34:00.561 --> 00:34:04.190
Let's get dolled up
with new bras and panties.


419
00:34:04.398 --> 00:34:06.192
I'm going to buy some Valium !

420
00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:08.569
- Meet back here.
- Okay.


421
00:34:19.789 --> 00:34:23.709
Incredible, I found a marvelous
babydoll and panty set !


422
00:34:23.918 --> 00:34:27.421
- I got drops and pills !
- The drops are wonderful.


423
00:34:27.588 --> 00:34:31.342
Let's go to the make-up counter
for some lipstick.


424
00:34:31.467 --> 00:34:33.719
- There they are !
- Oh God !


425
00:34:34.929 --> 00:34:37.348
Get the hell over here !

426
00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:42.311
- What are we doing ?
- We're having fun.


427
00:35:06.836 --> 00:35:10.381
- Me?
- Sorry, I thought you were American.


428
00:35:10.590 --> 00:35:13.968
Do you know where
we can find a taxi around here ?


429
00:35:14.135 --> 00:35:15.845
- No.
- Thanks.


430
00:35:16.971 --> 00:35:18.639
Need a lift ?

431
00:35:18.764 --> 00:35:20.725
Where to ?

432
00:35:20.891 --> 00:35:24.854
Villa Biondi, know it ?
Take the 24 to Ponzano.


433
00:35:25.021 --> 00:35:27.148
Then straight up the hill.

434
00:35:27.356 --> 00:35:31.152
Don't mess up
or we'll have to double back.


435
00:35:33.029 --> 00:35:37.283
Didn't you work at Seven Apples
in Marina di Pietrasanta ?


436
00:35:37.408 --> 00:35:39.285
- Me ?
- No, her.


437
00:35:39.410 --> 00:35:41.162
What's Seven Apples ?

438
00:35:41.370 --> 00:35:44.665
I was a regular there
before I got married, cool music.


439
00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:47.668
It's been a while though.
Still work there ?


440
00:35:47.877 --> 00:35:50.004
No, she doesn't work.

441
00:35:50.921 --> 00:35:56.052
When you got on your cube,
everyone stopped and stared.


442
00:35:56.260 --> 00:35:57.803
What cube ?

443
00:35:58.012 --> 00:36:00.681
You were with Maurizio,
the owner ?


444
00:36:01.265 --> 00:36:04.310
Maurizio ! Lordy, what a horrific name.

445
00:36:04.894 --> 00:36:08.814
Maurizio rhymes with Tizio,
horrible


446
00:36:09.940 --> 00:36:13.319
Those were good times,
we had a blast back then.


447
00:36:13.569 --> 00:36:16.197
Then that story ended up
in all the papers.


448
00:36:16.322 --> 00:36:19.700
- What story ?
- Did it really happen or not?


449
00:36:21.452 --> 00:36:25.289
Newspapers always print
a bunch of baloney...


450
00:36:29.210 --> 00:36:34.674
Why don't we all
go get a drink ?

451
00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:38.719
- Happy hour at your house ?
- No, not my house.


452
00:36:38.844 --> 00:36:43.057
There's a clean hotel nearby,
my friend works there...


453
00:36:43.224 --> 00:36:44.850
Quit pinching me.

454
00:36:45.059 --> 00:36:49.313
So long as there's a nice bar
that makes good martinis, I'm in.


455
00:36:58.864 --> 00:37:02.702
Wait here,
I'll see if there's room for us.


456
00:37:03.119 --> 00:37:05.204
Stay put.

457
00:37:07.373 --> 00:37:09.625
That jerk thinks we're whores.

458
00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:12.503
- No, he's lovely.
- My foot. Look at these...


459
00:37:12.712 --> 00:37:15.506
"Anal Vision 3D".

460
00:37:15.715 --> 00:37:19.635
You shouldn't poke around
in people's things.


461
00:37:22.263 --> 00:37:24.724
What are you doing ?

462
00:37:25.766 --> 00:37:28.394
Can you drive ? 
What are you doing ?

463
00:37:28.602 --> 00:37:31.355
Be quiet, you need to be quiet.

464
00:37:32.481 --> 00:37:33.983
Hey !

465
00:37:35.025 --> 00:37:36.610
My Car !

466
00:37:39.530 --> 00:37:40.906
Not my car !

467
00:37:43.367 --> 00:37:45.119
Not my car !

468
00:37:50.124 --> 00:37:53.919
- Watch out for the bike.
- We're crazy, aren't we ?


469
00:37:54.128 --> 00:37:56.130
Technically, yes.

470
00:37:56.922 --> 00:38:01.510
Amazing, we have a car.
We'll have a crazy good time !


471
00:38:02.303 --> 00:38:05.014
Let's go to the beach,
to see Pierluigi !


472
00:38:05.181 --> 00:38:07.266
- Who ?
- My husband.


473
00:38:07.433 --> 00:38:11.145
We'll go out on the sea,
he's got a 60-foot yacht.


474
00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:13.063
We'll breathe some sea air.

475
00:38:13.439 --> 00:38:16.525
- What day is today ?
- Friday, pay day.


476
00:38:16.942 --> 00:38:20.029
What date, what month ?
Is it already summer ?


477
00:38:20.279 --> 00:38:23.199
Dunno, but I want to go here.

478
00:38:29.079 --> 00:38:32.082
- Wanda Ulivieri.
- Coming !


479
00:38:45.095 --> 00:38:47.848
Oh God, it's Villa Biondi.

480
00:38:50.226 --> 00:38:51.477
Now what ?

481
00:38:51.602 --> 00:38:53.938
- Shut it off.
- <i>Hello ?</i>


482
00:38:54.104 --> 00:38:57.066
- Donatella Morelli.
- Here !


483
00:38:57.233 --> 00:38:59.193
<i>Can you hear me ?</i>

484
00:38:59.318 --> 00:39:00.361
<i>Hello ?</i>

485
00:39:01.070 --> 00:39:03.113
Can I come watch ?

486
00:39:06.617 --> 00:39:08.369
We have to call the police.

487
00:39:08.577 --> 00:39:11.247
Wait till tonight,
it's a harmless caper.


488
00:39:11.372 --> 00:39:14.375
If we call the police
they'll be in a lot more trouble.


489
00:39:14.583 --> 00:39:17.253
Shall we wait till
she kidnaps her son ?


490
00:39:17.378 --> 00:39:19.713
What do you think, sir ?

491
00:39:22.132 --> 00:39:23.968
Let's wait till tonight.

492
00:39:24.134 --> 00:39:26.887
But downplay it
with the other ladies,


493
00:39:27.012 --> 00:39:30.516
because they seem to be
a bit worked up.


494
00:39:30.641 --> 00:39:33.978
- Let's all run away !
- I don't want to run away.


495
00:39:34.979 --> 00:39:36.647
And where'll we go ?

496
00:39:36.772 --> 00:39:40.609
Sit down for group therapy !
Listen up !


497
00:39:47.157 --> 00:39:49.285
Sit in a circle !

498
00:39:58.669 --> 00:40:00.796
Does he know I think about him ?

499
00:40:01.297 --> 00:40:03.674
He dreams about you...

500
00:40:05.050 --> 00:40:07.052
and calls for you.

501
00:40:08.679 --> 00:40:10.014
Really ?

502
00:40:12.433 --> 00:40:14.435
Does he love his other mom ?

503
00:40:14.643 --> 00:40:17.897
Does he know
she's not his real mother ?


504
00:40:20.691 --> 00:40:22.026
Really ?

505
00:40:22.192 --> 00:40:25.905
Where does he live,
can you give me the address ?


506
00:40:26.530 --> 00:40:29.033
Quiet, wait.

507
00:40:29.575 --> 00:40:30.951
I see it!

508
00:40:31.285 --> 00:40:34.288
He's crossing...

509
00:40:34.830 --> 00:40:38.208
a river on his bike.

510
00:40:39.585 --> 00:40:43.672
He's wearing a lovely red sweater.

511
00:40:43.839 --> 00:40:45.049
<i>Red...</i>

512
00:40:47.217 --> 00:40:52.973
Here, a swatch from
the Holy Seton's robe.


513
00:40:54.850 --> 00:40:57.227
Go, my dear, we'll pray for you.

514
00:40:58.979 --> 00:41:01.941
Excuse me, I have something to ask too.

515
00:41:02.107 --> 00:41:07.237
Quiet, he often thinks about you
but is still hurting.


516
00:41:09.490 --> 00:41:12.493
He ? Renato ?
You mean Renato Corsi ?


517
00:41:12.701 --> 00:41:15.996
Quiet !
He wants to come to you but can't !


518
00:41:18.248 --> 00:41:20.084
Incredible !

519
00:41:20.250 --> 00:41:24.129
You're phenomenal,
in fact he's under house arrest.


520
00:41:24.338 --> 00:41:27.841
His violence has deep roots,

521
00:41:28.968 --> 00:41:33.514
a troubled childhood,
that's why he pushes you away.


522
00:41:33.722 --> 00:41:34.974
So true.

523
00:41:35.140 --> 00:41:38.852
The fact that I was rich and he's not
always upset him.


524
00:41:39.019 --> 00:41:41.730
But it's a deep bond.

525
00:41:41.855 --> 00:41:43.857
- I can feel it.
- Me too.


526
00:41:44.024 --> 00:41:46.527
<i>Me too... sorry...</i>

527
00:41:47.236 --> 00:41:50.155
- He no longer wants to see <i>me...</i>
- Quiet, I know.


528
00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:54.535
But he's not well, he misses you !

529
00:41:59.873 --> 00:42:02.126
Hello, Renato ?

530
00:42:02.751 --> 00:42:04.795
From a friend's phone.

531
00:42:05.671 --> 00:42:09.299
I just wanted to say
that I miss you too.


532
00:42:10.050 --> 00:42:15.431
And I'm glad that
you're no longer angry with me.


533
00:42:16.557 --> 00:42:18.767
And... what ?

534
00:42:21.770 --> 00:42:25.274
I don't understand
why you're treating me like this.


535
00:42:26.275 --> 00:42:28.068
Hello ?

536
00:42:33.824 --> 00:42:36.076
Put it in third, then fourth,

537
00:42:36.201 --> 00:42:39.788
downshift before the curve
then accelerate again.


538
00:42:39.955 --> 00:42:42.708
It's automatic.

539
00:43:05.481 --> 00:43:08.692
And with this guy Maurizio,
the cube,


540
00:43:08.859 --> 00:43:11.737
newspapers, your son...
what happened ?


541
00:43:11.862 --> 00:43:14.239
Why don't we go back ?

542
00:43:14.364 --> 00:43:17.117
You should open up and talk.

543
00:43:17.242 --> 00:43:20.621
Where the hell are we going,
what are we looking for ?


544
00:43:20.829 --> 00:43:24.958
- We're looking for some happiness.
- Where, stupid ?


545
00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:29.505
In nice places with linen tablecloths

546
00:43:30.005 --> 00:43:32.758
and good wine in crystal glasses,

547
00:43:32.883 --> 00:43:35.010
and polite people.

548
00:43:35.219 --> 00:43:37.262
That's where.

549
00:43:37.387 --> 00:43:40.516
Pity we don't have a cent left.

550
00:43:42.893 --> 00:43:45.771
- Where are we ?
- In Butthole Nowhere.


551
00:43:45.896 --> 00:43:49.274
- Where ?
- Montecatini's that way.


552
00:43:49.483 --> 00:43:53.862
Montecatini is glorious,
we could go to the spas !


553
00:43:53.987 --> 00:43:56.031
I grew up there and won't go back.

554
00:43:56.240 --> 00:44:01.161
Let's find a bank, an ATM.
How do you put it into first gear ?


555
00:44:01.286 --> 00:44:05.999
It's automatic, understand ?
You're so thick !


556
00:44:12.005 --> 00:44:13.674
Good evening.

557
00:44:13.882 --> 00:44:15.300
We're closing.

558
00:44:15.509 --> 00:44:18.137
I need to see the manager,
it's urgent.


559
00:44:18.303 --> 00:44:19.429
You are...?

560
00:44:19.555 --> 00:44:24.434
Maria Beatrice Morandini Valdirana,
the Countess.


561
00:44:25.519 --> 00:44:27.437
The manager must know me,

562
00:44:27.646 --> 00:44:30.399
we're important account holders here.

563
00:44:30.566 --> 00:44:33.402
- I'm the manager.
- Good evening.


564
00:44:34.069 --> 00:44:37.156
My colleague and I,
she's just waiting outside,


565
00:44:37.322 --> 00:44:41.201
have run into a little problem
I'd like to explain.


566
00:44:41.326 --> 00:44:42.452
Go ahead.

567
00:44:42.661 --> 00:44:46.081
We're guests at a villa
not far from here,


568
00:44:46.290 --> 00:44:48.333
it's quite prestigious

569
00:44:48.458 --> 00:44:51.962
and once belonged to
Marchioness Castora Biondi Valdirana,


570
00:44:52.087 --> 00:44:54.464
my great-aunt.

571
00:44:57.301 --> 00:44:59.219
Due to some red tape...

572
00:44:59.344 --> 00:45:02.848
they've retained our credit cards,
ATM cards, and such.


573
00:45:05.309 --> 00:45:07.603
And how can I help you ?

574
00:45:07.978 --> 00:45:11.356
Could you advance us some cash,

575
00:45:11.481 --> 00:45:13.734
nothing substantial...

576
00:45:17.696 --> 00:45:21.241
I'm perfectly fine,
you're the ones who aren't well !


577
00:45:21.366 --> 00:45:24.745
You banks are good for nothing

578
00:45:25.204 --> 00:45:29.499
but gobbling up the money
Draghi and the ECB granted you !


579
00:45:41.470 --> 00:45:42.888
Let's go.

580
00:45:43.639 --> 00:45:46.016
- Where ?
- To eat.


581
00:45:46.141 --> 00:45:48.393
All I had today was green tea.

582
00:45:48.769 --> 00:45:52.397
A quick sandwich and
back to Villa Biondi before dark.


583
00:45:52.606 --> 00:45:54.358
A sandwich ?!

584
00:45:54.524 --> 00:45:57.027
Who ever found happiness
in a sandwich ?


585
00:45:57.152 --> 00:45:58.654
It's yummy.

586
00:46:02.783 --> 00:46:05.661
- Will you be tasting the wine ?
- Indeed.


587
00:46:10.415 --> 00:46:11.667
Corked !

588
00:46:12.125 --> 00:46:13.418
I'll bring another one.

589
00:46:15.796 --> 00:46:18.799
- Corked what ?
- The wine tastes like cork.


590
00:46:20.175 --> 00:46:22.052
You hurt his feelings.

591
00:46:22.552 --> 00:46:25.305
Enough with this
social inferiority guilt trip.


592
00:46:25.514 --> 00:46:27.432
Servers are people who serve.

593
00:46:28.141 --> 00:46:31.436
If I'm not mistaken,
the specialty here is shellfish.


594
00:46:32.437 --> 00:46:34.773
Jermann's screw top wine ?

595
00:46:34.940 --> 00:46:36.316
All right.

596
00:46:46.159 --> 00:46:47.911
Perfect !

597
00:46:53.792 --> 00:46:57.337
Gosh, thanks, I appreciate it.
Thank you.


598
00:47:00.090 --> 00:47:02.342
- To Tchaikovsky.
- Who ?


599
00:47:02.676 --> 00:47:05.095
- Tchaikovsky !
- Rock on !


600
00:47:11.059 --> 00:47:14.062
...So do you have any siblings ?

601
00:47:17.941 --> 00:47:23.071
Before the mental clinics and judicial
psych hospitals did you live alone ?


602
00:47:24.072 --> 00:47:26.825
Sometimes alone,
sometimes with mom.


603
00:47:28.493 --> 00:47:31.079
Do you have a father
? Is he alive ?

604
00:47:34.499 --> 00:47:37.502
- Did they divorce ?
- Ages ago.


605
00:47:37.627 --> 00:47:39.087
All the better.

606
00:47:41.465 --> 00:47:43.884
Mine are still together,
it's ridiculous


607
00:47:44.092 --> 00:47:46.762
considering my father's a nance.

608
00:47:47.387 --> 00:47:49.639
A what ?

609
00:47:50.390 --> 00:47:52.517
Afag, a homo, a butt-fucker.

610
00:47:53.977 --> 00:47:56.355
Sorry, I didn't mean to bring it up.

611
00:47:56.521 --> 00:47:59.858
They prefer
to hate each other politely,


612
00:48:00.150 --> 00:48:03.153
it's the perfect
passive-aggressive dynamic,


613
00:48:03.278 --> 00:48:05.113
a textbook case.

614
00:48:05.781 --> 00:48:07.532
<i>I see...</i>

615
00:48:08.033 --> 00:48:11.912
Tell me, are you on amicable terms
with your mother ?


616
00:48:12.162 --> 00:48:15.374
She works for a disabled General now.

617
00:48:15.916 --> 00:48:17.667
And your father ?

618
00:48:19.669 --> 00:48:21.671
My dad is awesome.

619
00:48:21.797 --> 00:48:25.300
What does he do ? Does he work ?
Is he unemployed ?


620
00:48:26.009 --> 00:48:27.761
Pianist.

621
00:48:28.762 --> 00:48:31.056
How marvelous !

622
00:48:31.306 --> 00:48:34.434
So he's a classical pianist
who gives concerts ?


623
00:48:34.684 --> 00:48:39.773
- No, modern music in bars.
- Well that's marvelous too.


624
00:48:39.940 --> 00:48:43.819
He was Gino Paoli's pianist
before I was born.


625
00:48:43.944 --> 00:48:47.531
Now he has his own band
and he sings too.


626
00:48:51.159 --> 00:48:52.702
Call him, let's go see him.

627
00:48:52.911 --> 00:48:55.080
- I'll call him for you.
- No.


628
00:48:55.205 --> 00:48:56.832
Why not?

629
00:48:56.957 --> 00:49:01.086
I wouldn't want to embarrass him
or ruin his reputation.


630
00:49:02.045 --> 00:49:05.966
You're not a criminal,
you didn't try to kill anyone !


631
00:49:09.177 --> 00:49:11.721
What's the band called ?
Are they famous ?


632
00:49:13.056 --> 00:49:15.475
Damn right, I'll show you !

633
00:49:18.186 --> 00:49:19.980
"Hurricane Trio".

634
00:49:20.605 --> 00:49:23.108
You could've just bought a notebook

635
00:49:23.233 --> 00:49:25.193
instead of using your body.

636
00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:26.820
I like it !

637
00:49:26.987 --> 00:49:30.866
Try waxing now and again,
you've got armpit bushes !


638
00:49:30.991 --> 00:49:32.826
That's embarrassing.

639
00:49:39.082 --> 00:49:40.500
Excuse me.

640
00:49:43.879 --> 00:49:45.714
You asked to speak to me ?

641
00:49:45.881 --> 00:49:48.383
Actually, to the hotel manager,

642
00:49:48.592 --> 00:49:53.096
a dear friend of mine
and my husband's, attorney Aitiani.


643
00:49:53.263 --> 00:49:55.765
That would be me.
Good evening, ma'am.


644
00:49:55.974 --> 00:49:58.768
- Have we had the pleasure of meeting ?
- How odd...


645
00:49:58.977 --> 00:50:02.606
I recall a tall man
with a thin mustache,


646
00:50:02.772 --> 00:50:05.025
rather charming...

647
00:50:05.233 --> 00:50:09.279
Sorry to disappoint you,
but I'd be glad to help anyway.


648
00:50:09.488 --> 00:50:12.657
- Was the dinner to your liking ?
- It was yummy.


649
00:50:12.866 --> 00:50:15.243
We've had a minor setback though.

650
00:50:15.368 --> 00:50:20.665
Some ill-intentioned folks,
probably Romanians or Africans,


651
00:50:20.790 --> 00:50:24.044
have stolen our purses

652
00:50:24.252 --> 00:50:28.798
with all our money, ID,
and credit cards...


653
00:50:29.007 --> 00:50:30.425
Everything.

654
00:50:30.550 --> 00:50:34.262
So I was thinking what I could do

655
00:50:34.429 --> 00:50:39.267
is leave you our car registration here,

656
00:50:39.434 --> 00:50:43.063
and come back tomorrow
to settle everything.


657
00:50:43.813 --> 00:50:46.066
I'm not sure I understand.

658
00:50:46.274 --> 00:50:49.694
We're going to get it now
and will bring it back here,


659
00:50:49.819 --> 00:50:53.323
in the meantime,
give our compliments to the chef


660
00:50:53.448 --> 00:50:56.451
who never ceases to amaze,
it was wonderful !


661
00:50:56.660 --> 00:50:59.454
And the musician is great too.
Thanks.


662
00:51:09.297 --> 00:51:11.800
<i>'</i> Are YOU crazy ?
- Go, go !


663
00:51:11.967 --> 00:51:13.718
This is fun !

664
00:51:14.594 --> 00:51:16.805
Hey, that car is mine !

665
00:51:16.972 --> 00:51:19.724
Where are you going with my car ?

666
00:51:19.849 --> 00:51:22.310
Get out of my car, now !

667
00:51:22.561 --> 00:51:24.688
- Ouch !
- Ouch what ?


668
00:51:24.854 --> 00:51:28.441
I won't call the cops because
you're losers and I'm a gentleman.


669
00:51:28.608 --> 00:51:33.113
You won't call them because
then your wife would throw you out...


670
00:51:34.364 --> 00:51:37.951
Get your stuff and get lost
before I smack you !


671
00:51:41.371 --> 00:51:43.498
Pure insanity !

672
00:51:47.627 --> 00:51:50.213
How much for a threesome:
me, you, your daughter ?


673
00:51:50.380 --> 00:51:52.132
- Excuse me ?
- A threesome !


674
00:51:52.340 --> 00:51:54.467
- Hello !
- Hi, gals.


675
00:51:54.634 --> 00:51:57.637
- Let's take the train.
- At this time of night ?


676
00:51:57.846 --> 00:52:00.599
We'll sleep in the station
and take the first one out.


677
00:52:01.099 --> 00:52:03.143
Hey chicken head,

678
00:52:03.351 --> 00:52:08.481
know who are the nastiest,
most evil masters of the world ?


679
00:52:08.648 --> 00:52:11.151
- Multinationals !
- She doesn't get it.


680
00:52:11.359 --> 00:52:14.779
- I don't understand you.
- Forget about it...


681
00:52:14.904 --> 00:52:19.659
Are you nuts ? Trying to reason
with two crazy ladies.


682
00:52:22.412 --> 00:52:24.998
Will you settle down ?

683
00:52:26.041 --> 00:52:28.418
Be quiet and settle down.

684
00:52:29.377 --> 00:52:33.256
- I can't hear you from here !
- Chill out, damn it.


685
00:52:35.508 --> 00:52:38.011
- I like to converse.
- Damn it !


686
00:52:38.178 --> 00:52:41.556
Shut that damn mouth of yours.

687
00:52:42.766 --> 00:52:44.392
Who is it?

688
00:52:45.685 --> 00:52:47.187
Mom ?

689
00:52:47.395 --> 00:52:48.938
It's mom !

690
00:52:49.147 --> 00:52:50.899
Why are you answering ?

691
00:52:51.066 --> 00:52:54.569
Yes, ma'am. I'm a friend of hers.

692
00:52:55.445 --> 00:52:58.448
- Where are you going ?
- To get them.


693
00:52:58.573 --> 00:53:00.408
I don't trust Luciana.

694
00:53:00.533 --> 00:53:02.452
Take Francesco and Giada with you.

695
00:53:02.577 --> 00:53:06.581
I can handle it, keep an eye
on the other girls, they're shaken up.


696
00:53:08.708 --> 00:53:11.961
- What are you doing here ?
- Let's go.


697
00:53:15.048 --> 00:53:17.842
- You're here for me now then.
- Now and then.


698
00:53:30.730 --> 00:53:32.482
Is that her ?

699
00:53:38.988 --> 00:53:41.825
What on earth have you done ?

700
00:53:42.242 --> 00:53:46.454
Villa Biondi's been calling me all day
looking for you.


701
00:53:46.621 --> 00:53:49.999
But they're nice, they said
you could stay with me tonight.


702
00:53:50.834 --> 00:53:53.461
Villa Biondi must be a great place.

703
00:53:54.212 --> 00:53:56.089
You work and they pay you...

704
00:53:56.756 --> 00:53:59.384
And how much do you earn, honey ?

705
00:53:59.843 --> 00:54:02.762
I need some bridge work done,
it costs a fortune.


706
00:54:02.887 --> 00:54:05.765
Even though I slog away
for the General,


707
00:54:05.974 --> 00:54:09.102
I still come up short
at the end of the month...


708
00:54:12.522 --> 00:54:15.525
Don't wake the General
or he'll never go back to sleep.


709
00:54:15.775 --> 00:54:18.653
But I read the letter. <i>..</i>

710
00:54:18.862 --> 00:54:21.030
- What letter ?
- The will.


711
00:54:21.239 --> 00:54:24.659
He's leaving it all to me:
Luciana Brogi Morelli.


712
00:54:24.784 --> 00:54:27.912
No surprise since his kids
never even visit him !


713
00:54:28.037 --> 00:54:30.749
Who do you think
cleans his ass every day ?


714
00:54:30.915 --> 00:54:35.295
Who puts up with his groping hands
when I spoon-feed him ?


715
00:54:35.545 --> 00:54:40.383
But when I finally own this place
with all its heirlooms and medals,


716
00:54:40.550 --> 00:54:43.636
I'll be able to help you,
my little darling.


717
00:54:44.888 --> 00:54:47.807
She doesn't realize
how much I love her.


718
00:54:47.932 --> 00:54:52.812
A mother's love is all giving,
never expecting anything in return.


719
00:54:53.021 --> 00:54:57.025
- Do you get along with your mom ?
- No, don't ask...


720
00:54:57.192 --> 00:55:00.695
I'll show you your room,
if it's okay with you.


721
00:55:00.904 --> 00:55:04.199
- Luciana !
- Sweet Jesus, he woke up.


722
00:55:05.033 --> 00:55:06.451
Coming !

723
00:55:06.576 --> 00:55:07.952
<i>Sorry...</i>

724
00:55:08.077 --> 00:55:10.205
- Come here, honey.
- No.


725
00:55:10.413 --> 00:55:12.665
He'll be happy to see you.

726
00:55:12.832 --> 00:55:15.210
- He wants to see you.
- I don't.


727
00:55:15.335 --> 00:55:17.086
He likes you.

728
00:55:17.212 --> 00:55:20.465
Can't blame him,
with those perky buns of yours...


729
00:55:20.590 --> 00:55:23.468
- What are you saying ?
- Mine lost their tone...


730
00:55:23.593 --> 00:55:25.720
But I still look pretty good...

731
00:55:26.971 --> 00:55:28.973
General ?

732
00:55:29.182 --> 00:55:32.852
Look who's here,
isn't this a lovely surprise ?


733
00:55:40.985 --> 00:55:44.322
No kisses, how gross !

734
00:55:44.489 --> 00:55:47.367
- Hush, he'll hear you !
- Quit pinching me !


735
00:55:47.492 --> 00:55:50.078
What are you doing ?!

736
00:55:50.578 --> 00:55:53.748
Darn hot flashes...
Know why she's so sore with me ?


737
00:55:54.707 --> 00:55:58.586
I didn't assume parental authority of
the kid, like social services asked.


738
00:55:58.753 --> 00:56:01.631
I didn't know
they'd put him up for adoption !


739
00:56:01.840 --> 00:56:05.009
You didn't know ? What on earth
are you blabbering about?


740
00:56:05.510 --> 00:56:10.139
Ms. Beatrice, you explain it to her,
I did it for the good of the boy.


741
00:56:10.265 --> 00:56:12.100
It was only right !

742
00:56:12.392 --> 00:56:14.394
I couldn't raise him,

743
00:56:14.602 --> 00:56:16.646
I worked all day, she was a mess.

744
00:56:16.855 --> 00:56:20.483
Depression is a brutal beast.
A real family's better.


745
00:56:20.650 --> 00:56:24.529
So you knew very well
that he'd be put up for adoption...


746
00:56:24.654 --> 00:56:27.365
And Maurizio as a father...

747
00:56:27.532 --> 00:56:31.035
he went and fooled around
though he was married with kids,


748
00:56:31.160 --> 00:56:34.289
and when this dummy got pregnant,
what did he do ?


749
00:56:34.497 --> 00:56:38.376
- Fired her from Seven Apples.
- Enough mom, shut up!


750
00:56:38.543 --> 00:56:41.170
- Thanks, now get lost !
- You hurt me.


751
00:56:41.296 --> 00:56:43.798
Knock it off or
I will hurt you !

752
00:56:43.923 --> 00:56:46.384
I'll have you institutionalized !

753
00:56:46.801 --> 00:56:48.386
Go away, mom !

754
00:56:49.053 --> 00:56:51.806
Ma'am, I'll go make up the beds.

755
00:56:52.390 --> 00:56:53.808
Bitch !

756
00:56:54.809 --> 00:56:59.439
- She makes me sick.
- Complicated dynamics.


757
00:57:11.576 --> 00:57:14.078
- Doctor ?
- It's Fiamma ?


758
00:57:14.454 --> 00:57:16.331
Yes, they're here.

759
00:57:16.831 --> 00:57:20.043
Yes, they're safe and sound...

760
00:57:20.960 --> 00:57:23.588
I'll send them off to bed now.

761
00:57:24.422 --> 00:57:27.216
You can come get them, no rush.

762
00:57:27.967 --> 00:57:29.427
Goodbye.

763
00:57:30.094 --> 00:57:34.307
Can we get out of here ?
But quit pushing me, okay ?


764
00:57:34.474 --> 00:57:36.601
- Hold on.
- What?


765
00:57:36.726 --> 00:57:39.979
Let's see
if we can dig up some change...


766
00:57:40.605 --> 00:57:42.357
She's coming.

767
00:57:43.733 --> 00:57:45.985
Your mom asks you for money

768
00:57:46.110 --> 00:57:50.448
but she has 985 euros
hidden in a tampon box in her bag !


769
00:57:50.949 --> 00:57:54.243
I wondered why a menopausal lady
had tampons...


770
00:57:54.577 --> 00:57:57.705
- She'll report us when she notices.
- No such thing.


771
00:57:57.872 --> 00:58:00.959
She will, I know her well.
That's nearly 1,000 euros,


772
00:58:01.125 --> 00:58:03.753
we can make it
last for a few days.

773
00:58:03.878 --> 00:58:06.881
It's like being in Rio
for the carnival !


774
00:58:07.090 --> 00:58:10.009
Let's ask someone for a ride
and get a drink...


775
00:58:10.134 --> 00:58:12.136
Someone who ?

776
00:58:12.345 --> 00:58:14.722
Oh God...
No, please.


777
00:58:16.224 --> 00:58:17.892
- Excuse me !
- Where are you going ?


778
00:58:18.476 --> 00:58:21.896
Let's get a drink somewhere,
will you give us a lift ?


779
00:58:22.897 --> 00:58:25.024
Sure, lady.

780
00:58:29.028 --> 00:58:30.989
- Thanks.
- Get in.


781
00:58:34.993 --> 00:58:38.037
- I can manage on my own.
- All right.


782
00:58:43.167 --> 00:58:46.295
- Where to ?
- We're going to Seven Apples.


783
00:58:46.421 --> 00:58:49.632
That name rings a bell,
was someone talking about it ?


784
00:58:49.924 --> 00:58:54.012
It's casino night, with a roulette
and croupier from Montecarlo.


785
00:58:55.638 --> 00:58:58.307
Donatella ?

786
00:59:00.560 --> 00:59:02.061
<i>Honey ...</i>

787
00:59:03.312 --> 00:59:06.691
- Not coming ?
- No, I'll smoke a cigarette.


788
00:59:07.567 --> 00:59:11.779
Here's some money to get in,
I'll be inside.


789
00:59:12.280 --> 00:59:13.448
Wait for me !

790
00:59:16.075 --> 00:59:18.661
I want to dance all night long.

791
01:00:07.627 --> 01:00:10.129
Look at what pretty eyes she has !

792
01:00:15.843 --> 01:00:17.220
Did you have fun ?

793
01:00:17.595 --> 01:00:18.888
Hi, Maurizio.

794
01:00:20.973 --> 01:00:23.226
Don't recognize me ?

795
01:00:27.730 --> 01:00:30.983
Can I have a vodka tonic, please ?

796
01:00:31.526 --> 01:00:33.402
Vodka and tonic separately.

797
01:00:42.036 --> 01:00:44.789
Okay, but then get out of here.

798
01:00:55.299 --> 01:00:58.052
- Hands off!
- Get out or I'll call the cops.


799
01:00:58.261 --> 01:01:02.557
Hands off or I'll call the cops.
Let go of me !


800
01:01:23.911 --> 01:01:26.455
- Can we get out of here ?
- Hold on, wait.


801
01:01:28.958 --> 01:01:30.710
Can we go, please ?

802
01:01:30.918 --> 01:01:34.088
It's not fair, they're cheating.
They're swindlers.


803
01:01:35.298 --> 01:01:39.218
Do you have any money left ?
I need to make one more bet.


804
01:01:39.719 --> 01:01:42.722
Do you have your 20 euros still ?

805
01:01:44.473 --> 01:01:46.309
You blew it all ?

806
01:01:47.476 --> 01:01:49.812
Give me the money I handed you before,

807
01:01:49.979 --> 01:01:51.981
I'm the one who took it !

808
01:01:53.316 --> 01:01:55.860
I'm generous and you're greedy !

809
01:01:55.985 --> 01:01:58.321
Give it to me now !

810
01:01:58.863 --> 01:02:00.615
Are you nuts ?

811
01:02:00.823 --> 01:02:04.327
If I'm nuts then what are you ?

812
01:02:04.869 --> 01:02:07.955
What are you ? 
You're psychotic.

813
01:02:08.122 --> 01:02:11.334
You need electroshock therapy !

814
01:02:13.461 --> 01:02:17.882
Answer me, you ingrate !
After all I've done for you.


815
01:02:18.007 --> 01:02:21.385
What? You're an old loon
who talks bullshit !


816
01:02:21.510 --> 01:02:24.639
Big-shot attorney husband,
aristocratic family, all bullshit !


817
01:02:24.847 --> 01:02:26.641
How dare you ?

818
01:02:26.766 --> 01:02:29.393
You uncouth, ignorant creature !

819
01:02:29.602 --> 01:02:33.481
Worthless trash !
Why did I waste my time on you ?


820
01:02:33.648 --> 01:02:36.275
Be quiet, you're in withdrawal !

821
01:02:36.525 --> 01:02:40.112
Why did I put up with you
and your insignificant life ?


822
01:02:40.404 --> 01:02:43.366
- Insignificant life !
- Calm down !


823
01:02:44.033 --> 01:02:46.410
Are you crazy ?!

824
01:02:47.411 --> 01:02:49.372
I'll kill you I

825
01:02:52.541 --> 01:02:54.418
You didn't even want to see him !

826
01:02:54.627 --> 01:02:56.879
Grab her ! She's dangerous !

827
01:02:57.046 --> 01:02:59.548
- I'll kill myself.
- Stop I


828
01:03:04.428 --> 01:03:08.057
I won't go back in there !

829
01:03:09.642 --> 01:03:11.310
Move it.

830
01:03:12.019 --> 01:03:15.189
She attacked me, she's insane !

831
01:03:15.398 --> 01:03:17.566
- You should institutionalize her !
- Calm down.


832
01:03:18.317 --> 01:03:20.569
You're a shit,

833
01:03:20.695 --> 01:03:23.447
you didn't even want to see him !

834
01:03:23.948 --> 01:03:25.449
A shit !

835
01:03:25.825 --> 01:03:26.951
Get in !

836
01:03:29.537 --> 01:03:33.541
A shitty life, a shitty life.

837
01:03:33.833 --> 01:03:35.543
- You're fine.
- There's blood.


838
01:03:35.710 --> 01:03:38.296
- Calm down.
- Take me to the ER.


839
01:03:38.462 --> 01:03:40.965
Right away, just calm down.

840
01:03:41.173 --> 01:03:42.842
Get her a chair !

841
01:03:43.926 --> 01:03:46.971
Untie me ! Why've
you tied me up !?

842
01:03:47.096 --> 01:03:50.182
I don't want to
be tied up, no !

843
01:03:56.981 --> 01:03:59.567
You're hurting me !

844
01:03:59.692 --> 01:04:01.485
- It hurts !
- Calm down.


845
01:04:01.610 --> 01:04:03.738
Why me ?

846
01:04:04.613 --> 01:04:08.826
I'll stay here, they're treating
the cut on her head.


847
01:04:10.244 --> 01:04:13.622
She has to go to
the psych ward too ? Hold on.


848
01:04:16.876 --> 01:04:19.211
- Where's that other lady ?
- Who ?


849
01:04:19.378 --> 01:04:20.588
Excuse me.

850
01:04:20.755 --> 01:04:23.382
Fucking hell. Give me a second.

851
01:04:24.258 --> 01:04:27.762
I'm Fiamma Zappa.
Lorenzini, head of the clinic.


852
01:04:28.137 --> 01:04:30.890
Where is she ?
We need to take her back.


853
01:04:31.098 --> 01:04:34.602
Not yet. Torrigiani,
the social worker, is on his way.


854
01:04:34.769 --> 01:04:38.397
- Torrigiani, why ?
- He already called the judge.


855
01:04:38.522 --> 01:04:41.150
She's going to
a judicial psychiatric hospital.


856
01:04:41.275 --> 01:04:43.611
Damn it, Torrigiani's an asshole !

857
01:04:43.778 --> 01:04:45.613
Why didn't he call me ?

858
01:04:45.780 --> 01:04:48.491
He convinced the judge
that Morelli's a danger.


859
01:04:48.657 --> 01:04:52.370
- After the nursery school incident.
- He told you about it?


860
01:04:52.536 --> 01:04:56.165
Actually, we know Morelli,
she's been institutionalized before.


861
01:04:56.290 --> 01:05:00.294
The head doctor agrees with Torrigiani.
Psych hospital unless...


862
01:05:00.419 --> 01:05:04.548
She's not dangerous !
She didn't try to approach the minor.


863
01:05:04.757 --> 01:05:06.675
Unless what ?

864
01:05:06.884 --> 01:05:09.428
Unless her father
takes wardship of her.


865
01:05:09.553 --> 01:05:12.264
- Whose father ?
- Hers.


866
01:05:12.807 --> 01:05:14.392
Floriano Morelli ?

867
01:05:14.558 --> 01:05:17.770
But he abandoned her years ago.

868
01:05:17.937 --> 01:05:19.939
- Let me see Donatella.
- Hold on.


869
01:05:20.064 --> 01:05:23.025
- She's with him now.
- Him who ?


870
01:05:23.192 --> 01:05:27.196
Her father, she called him
to ask him to take wardship of her.


871
01:05:28.781 --> 01:05:30.449
She called him ?

872
01:05:31.283 --> 01:05:33.911
You know what your mother's like...

873
01:05:34.078 --> 01:05:37.790
she's convinced
she'll inherit the General's estate.


874
01:05:38.207 --> 01:05:41.836
Apparently, that old loon
showed her some letter...


875
01:05:43.212 --> 01:05:47.591
She doesn't realize his kids
declared him mentally incompetent.


876
01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:50.928
I'm in even worse shape.

877
01:05:51.429 --> 01:05:53.556
I play in shitty bars,

878
01:05:53.722 --> 01:05:57.184
and I'm drowning in debt at my age.

879
01:05:57.810 --> 01:06:02.064
They repossessed my car,
and I've lost a kidney.


880
01:06:02.356 --> 01:06:05.234
A kidney, daddy ? 
I had no idea.

881
01:06:06.110 --> 01:06:10.990
You need to help yourself, my darling.

882
01:06:11.615 --> 01:06:16.996
If the doctors and judge want you
in a judicial psychiatric hospital,


883
01:06:17.621 --> 01:06:19.748
then it's for your own good.

884
01:06:20.374 --> 01:06:23.502
Daddy, are you getting treatment?

885
01:06:24.253 --> 01:06:29.592
Dialysis twice a week,
there's not much to treat.


886
01:06:33.762 --> 01:06:36.265
You were so important to me.

887
01:06:36.849 --> 01:06:38.267
Important ?

888
01:06:38.767 --> 01:06:40.269
<i>Yes.</i>

889
01:06:40.478 --> 01:06:44.106
I always listen to the song
you wrote for me.


890
01:06:45.274 --> 01:06:47.776
Remember ? You'd sing me to sleep.

891
01:07:02.791 --> 01:07:07.046
I don't recall tucking you in
or singing you to sleep.


892
01:07:08.047 --> 01:07:13.385
And I wish I'd written that song !

893
01:07:14.553 --> 01:07:18.390
Yeah, I might've composed <i>it...</i>

894
01:07:18.557 --> 01:07:21.894
but I gave it Gino.

895
01:07:22.311 --> 01:07:25.898
My problem is I'm too good.

896
01:07:27.316 --> 01:07:29.818
- Don't even think about it.
- It's not much.


897
01:07:30.027 --> 01:07:33.155
- No need, daddy.
- I'm ashamed of myself.


898
01:07:34.406 --> 01:07:36.951
It's all I have, 120.

899
01:07:37.159 --> 01:07:42.081
But it's right for you to know
how things really stand.


900
01:07:47.336 --> 01:07:50.798
Now I have to go,
I have a concert to finish.


901
01:07:50.965 --> 01:07:54.093
- I missed you.
- Good luck.


902
01:07:55.177 --> 01:07:57.721
Good luck, Donatella.

903
01:07:58.722 --> 01:08:00.432
- Daddy.
- What ?


904
01:08:01.475 --> 01:08:04.103
I'm really sorry for calling you.

905
01:08:04.311 --> 01:08:07.982
I'm sorry for always being a nuisance.

906
01:08:16.865 --> 01:08:18.951
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.


907
01:08:21.370 --> 01:08:23.747
- What a jacket.
- What a shithead.


908
01:08:24.248 --> 01:08:26.375
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.


909
01:08:26.625 --> 01:08:29.712
- Let's find her partner in crime.
- We need to talk.


910
01:08:38.262 --> 01:08:40.389
Thanks so much, really !

911
01:08:40.764 --> 01:08:44.101
You were sweethearts, bye.

912
01:08:52.234 --> 01:08:54.737
Oh God, she's here.

913
01:08:56.113 --> 01:08:58.407
- She's here.
- Who ?


914
01:08:58.616 --> 01:09:00.534
The lady !

915
01:09:01.910 --> 01:09:03.871
Aloha !

916
01:09:04.038 --> 01:09:06.665
No need to get <i>up...</i>
Pierluigi !


917
01:09:07.791 --> 01:09:11.170
You replaced the couch
with those atrocious chairs ?


918
01:09:11.295 --> 01:09:13.505
What's that breezy bed ?

919
01:09:13.672 --> 01:09:15.883
Looks like a two-bit hotel...

920
01:09:16.050 --> 01:09:18.886
Beatrice ! What have you done ?
Villa Biondi called.


921
01:09:19.053 --> 01:09:22.056
I was going to go stay
with the Albertinis <i>or...</i>


922
01:09:22.181 --> 01:09:23.682
Her drops !

923
01:09:23.891 --> 01:09:26.769
Or with lppolita,
or even the Malagos...


924
01:09:26.935 --> 01:09:30.064
But why should I be someone's guest
when I have a house !


925
01:09:30.189 --> 01:09:32.816
- Aren't you glad ?
- Are you okay ?


926
01:09:32.941 --> 01:09:36.403
- You skipped your meds yesterday.
- I just have a little cut.


927
01:09:36.820 --> 01:09:41.033
I could use a nice hot bath
and a good sleep.


928
01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:42.326
Here.

929
01:09:42.451 --> 01:09:44.453
A welcome drink !

930
01:09:44.662 --> 01:09:47.831
- You just showed up suddenly...
- How wonderful.


931
01:09:48.040 --> 01:09:51.960
I'll stay in the annex,
so I'll get out of your hair.


932
01:09:52.086 --> 01:09:54.588
Maria Laura
put the children's things there.


933
01:09:54.797 --> 01:09:58.842
Your jaw’s so tense, what's wrong ?
But you look good.


934
01:09:59.051 --> 01:10:00.803
Here's what we'll <i>do...</i>

935
01:10:00.969 --> 01:10:04.598
rest up and then
I'll have you driven to the clinic.


936
01:10:04.723 --> 01:10:06.475
I'll take the blue room.

937
01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:08.977
Ines !

938
01:10:10.479 --> 01:10:14.358
Take me to the blue room,
I had an exhausting night !


939
01:10:14.483 --> 01:10:18.487
Move that butt of yours,
you've filled out...


940
01:10:18.696 --> 01:10:20.698
You knew she'd come here ?

941
01:10:20.864 --> 01:10:23.075
Darling, I'm still her attorney.

942
01:10:23.242 --> 01:10:26.620
- Will you explain what's going on ?
- Nothing.


943
01:10:26.870 --> 01:10:28.747
I'll take her back to Villa Biondi.

944
01:10:28.956 --> 01:10:31.500
I must ensure she doesn't get
thrown in jail again.


945
01:10:31.625 --> 01:10:34.503
So she'll stay here tonight ?
With the children ?


946
01:10:34.628 --> 01:10:37.214
Darling, try to understand.

947
01:10:39.842 --> 01:10:43.137
Glad we didn't throw away
your things.


948
01:10:43.345 --> 01:10:46.390
We had to hide it from her
or she'd be furious.


949
01:10:46.515 --> 01:10:49.518
My wedding dress,
how exciting !


950
01:10:49.643 --> 01:10:52.020
Wonder if it still fits me.

951
01:11:02.656 --> 01:11:04.241
Finally !

952
01:11:05.868 --> 01:11:08.787
A nice hot bath
and an ice-cold drink


953
01:11:09.037 --> 01:11:11.915
always restore my faith in life.

954
01:11:12.124 --> 01:11:13.876
Stay seated.

955
01:11:14.042 --> 01:11:17.796
I'd be delighted to eat with you
if there's anything left.


956
01:11:18.005 --> 01:11:20.507
By the way, what'll we do today ?

957
01:11:20.674 --> 01:11:24.762
The yacht is moored,
we could sail out to Giglio perhaps.


958
01:11:24.928 --> 01:11:27.931
Matteo, Amelia, let's go.
Come on, Rachele.


959
01:11:28.432 --> 01:11:31.518
- Well we don't have to go to Giglio !
- Mom, what's bipolar mean ?


960
01:11:31.769 --> 01:11:33.645
Please stay calm.

961
01:11:33.812 --> 01:11:37.691
I'd even be content staring out
at this poetic view.


962
01:11:50.662 --> 01:11:52.289
Good morning.

963
01:11:52.539 --> 01:11:54.082
This way.

964
01:12:13.852 --> 01:12:15.354
<i>Hi.</i>

965
01:12:16.605 --> 01:12:19.358
I just wanted to greet her.

966
01:12:24.071 --> 01:12:26.114
- I'll do it myself.
- All right.


967
01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:27.991
I can do it.

968
01:12:36.708 --> 01:12:40.212
I really hoped
I wouldn't see you here again.


969
01:12:40.754 --> 01:12:43.090
No stupid stunts this time.

970
01:12:43.257 --> 01:12:44.508
How's your leg ?

971
01:12:46.009 --> 01:12:47.761
My leg is fine.

972
01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:50.472
Let's see...

973
01:12:53.225 --> 01:12:55.477
Get up, miss.

974
01:12:57.521 --> 01:13:00.232
I'd give her 30 more drops.

975
01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:08.532
Your antics made
everyone uncomfortable.


976
01:13:08.657 --> 01:13:12.494
- I made everyone uncomfortable ?
- Why are you taking the kids away ?


977
01:13:12.661 --> 01:13:14.746
I'll explain it to you later.

978
01:13:14.913 --> 01:13:17.040
- Bye, kids.
- Say bye to dad.


979
01:13:17.249 --> 01:13:19.251
See you soon.

980
01:13:26.258 --> 01:13:28.886
Is it just the two of us ?

981
01:13:30.053 --> 01:13:32.264
Why did you let her leave ?

982
01:13:32.389 --> 01:13:35.809
She's sweet, she loves you,
she's good for you.


983
01:13:36.518 --> 01:13:40.689
I realize she bores you
but I'm sure she has good points.


984
01:13:40.814 --> 01:13:44.067
She doesn't bore me,
why do you think that ?


985
01:13:44.318 --> 01:13:47.321
Don't be so disparaging
of the poor thing.


986
01:13:47.446 --> 01:13:50.574
- I love her, you know.
- Of course.


987
01:13:51.074 --> 01:13:53.076
She's not like you

988
01:13:53.285 --> 01:13:56.580
and that orangutan jailbird
you cheated on me with.


989
01:13:56.705 --> 01:13:59.708
You even forced me to represent him.

990
01:14:11.303 --> 01:14:13.305
You're beautiful.

991
01:14:13.430 --> 01:14:16.975
I bought it in a cheap store
but it's rather cute.


992
01:14:17.184 --> 01:14:21.355
- Tell me, have you seen him again ?
- Stop it.


993
01:14:21.730 --> 01:14:24.358
I was afraid
you ran away to go see him.


994
01:14:24.566 --> 01:14:27.611
You're so jealous !

995
01:14:29.613 --> 01:14:32.115
Tomorrow I'll take you back
to the clinic


996
01:14:32.324 --> 01:14:34.701
and I'll have myself admitted too.

997
01:14:34.868 --> 01:14:38.497
Yes, in the special ward
for clingy types.


998
01:14:39.206 --> 01:14:41.959
Clingy.

- God no, this place is a drag.


1007
01:15:58.827 --> 01:16:01.204
I'm sorry you're leaving.

1008
01:16:01.413 --> 01:16:03.457
Goodbye.

1009
01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:10.422
No need... I'm a big girl now,
goodbye.


1010
01:16:10.714 --> 01:16:14.176
- Where to ?
- Away from here for now.

- It's illegal.


1013
01:16:22.100 --> 01:16:24.186
Thanks, so kind.

1014
01:16:25.062 --> 01:16:28.065
How much would it cost
to go to Mantua ?


1015
01:16:28.231 --> 01:16:31.735
At least 500 euros, ma'am.

1016
01:16:31.860 --> 01:16:33.612
Make it 1,000...

- Are you married ?
- With all due respect, yes.

Let your wife know you're mine today.

- How long has she been here ?
- Since this morning.

Donatella...

1021
01:16:50.504 --> 01:16:52.631
Shall we get up ?

1022
01:16:53.215 --> 01:16:55.592
Come on.

1023
01:16:56.134 --> 01:16:57.636
Did she eat?

1024
01:16:57.844 --> 01:17:00.722
Dunno, I can't spoon-feed them all !

1025
01:17:00.889 --> 01:17:03.642
- Did she take her meds ?
- She's a greedy one...


1026
01:17:04.101 --> 01:17:07.479
She wants to up the doses,
says it's not enough.

What would you like ?

She did a few rounds in Pisa

1031
01:17:23.995 --> 01:17:27.290
Why keep her here ?
Let's send her back there.


1032
01:17:27.666 --> 01:17:30.293
Go get me her chart.

1033

Unlock her room for me.

1034

- Wait here.
- Okay.


1040
01:18:16.548 --> 01:18:21.469
Good morning, I just need 5 minutes
to see a relative.


1041
01:18:21.595 --> 01:18:25.098
- Sorry, I can't allow that.
- I'll be quick, really.


1042
01:18:25.932 --> 01:18:29.227
Check with the office,
I sent an email...


1043
01:18:29.352 --> 01:18:30.979
I can't allow that.

1044
01:18:31.188 --> 01:18:32.731
Are you a broken record ?

1045
01:18:32.939 --> 01:18:36.318
- I can't allow that, please leave.
- So rude I


1046
01:18:37.611 --> 01:18:40.739
I'd like to speak to
Donatella Morelli, please.

Yes, she's a patient of yours.

1048
01:18:45.577 --> 01:18:47.579
It's boiling.

1049
01:18:48.496 --> 01:18:50.081
I'm a relative...

1050

<i>Yes.</i>

1052

Perfect, thanks. Goodbye.

No, it's nothing.

I only gave you 40 drops.

1065
01:19:39.047 --> 01:19:40.924
You seemed stressed,

1066
01:19:41.049 --> 01:19:44.386
I thought you could use a good rest...

1067

01:21:42.545 --> 01:21:44.172
- Take this !
- But why !?


1081
01:21:44.297 --> 01:21:47.634
Stop it !
Why are you doing this, honey ?


1082
01:21:47.801 --> 01:21:51.554
Your faggy husband
swore he'd spoken to the judge


1083
01:21:52.013 --> 01:21:53.932
but I found out it wasn't true.

1084
01:21:54.140 --> 01:21:57.811
How much longer do I have to stay
locked up in this shithole ?


1085
01:21:58.269 --> 01:22:00.021
I have cash, for you !

1086
01:22:00.271 --> 01:22:02.148
I know you need <i>it...</i>

1087
01:22:02.315 --> 01:22:04.317
- Everything okay, ma'am ?
- Yes...


1088
01:22:04.442 --> 01:22:06.694
Don't worry, leave me alone.

1089
01:22:07.779 --> 01:22:09.572
Let me come up for a minute.

1090
01:22:09.781 --> 01:22:12.659
Renato said to give it to me.

1091
01:22:16.162 --> 01:22:18.206
Give it to her ?

1092
01:22:18.331 --> 01:22:21.334
- Got a problem with that ?
- No...


1093
01:22:21.459 --> 01:22:25.046
Are you in a steady relationship ?

1094
01:22:25.213 --> 01:22:27.090
- Is it serious ?
- The money...


1095
01:22:28.425 --> 01:22:30.468
- Here's the money.
- Yes.


1096
01:22:31.845 --> 01:22:35.473
- I can give you these too...
- I can't allow this.


1097
01:22:35.807 --> 01:22:38.977
I know it's not my business,
but we should get out of here.


1098
01:22:39.477 --> 01:22:41.104
Who the fuck are you ?!

1099
01:22:41.229 --> 01:22:43.815
You can't take advantage
of her like this.


1100
01:22:44.107 --> 01:22:45.984
Geppetto, I'll find you !

1101
01:22:46.192 --> 01:22:49.988
- I was going to pay you anyway.
- That's not it, let's just go.


1102
01:22:50.113 --> 01:22:53.074
You're a psychopath,
you ruined my life !


1103
01:22:53.241 --> 01:22:55.368
- Love...
- Love, my ass !


1104
01:22:55.493 --> 01:22:58.955
Don't use vulgar gestures
like that with me.


1105
01:23:00.206 --> 01:23:05.086
Drag in everyone
who was here on duty last night !


1106
01:23:05.253 --> 01:23:07.380
And let me know.

1107
01:23:08.465 --> 01:23:09.507
Nothing.

1108
01:23:22.270 --> 01:23:24.272
Thanks.

1109
01:23:35.116 --> 01:23:39.287
Excuse me, I'm looking for Beatrice.
Moreschini Valdirana...


1110
01:23:39.537 --> 01:23:41.748
Dunno, go ask them.

1111
01:23:41.873 --> 01:23:43.917
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.


1112
01:23:52.008 --> 01:23:54.177
Are you looking for Beatrice ?

1113
01:23:54.385 --> 01:23:57.055
Yes, she and I are friends.

1114
01:23:57.555 --> 01:24:00.266
- I'm her mom, come with me.
- How nice.


1115
01:24:00.433 --> 01:24:04.020
That nutcase has parked herself
in the guesthouse


1116
01:24:04.187 --> 01:24:06.689
and we can't get her out.

1117
01:24:06.898 --> 01:24:10.944
They want to shoot in there,
the set designers need to prep it.


1118
01:24:11.069 --> 01:24:14.322
No worries,
she and I will get out of your hair.


1119
01:24:14.447 --> 01:24:16.908
Good, go very far away.

1120
01:24:17.325 --> 01:24:20.036
Is this Beatrice's house ?

1121
01:24:20.203 --> 01:24:23.540
In her dreams, this is my house !

1122
01:24:24.457 --> 01:24:28.586
You can't imagine the havoc
she has wreaked in our lives.


1123
01:24:28.795 --> 01:24:30.922
She's an egoistic liar.

1124
01:24:31.047 --> 01:24:35.093
She's been deceiving people
her whole life, starting with us


1125
01:24:35.301 --> 01:24:39.097
until she came across
an even bigger cheat.


1126
01:24:39.305 --> 01:24:43.726
That unspeakable creature,
Renato Corsi !


1127
01:24:45.103 --> 01:24:47.313
A real imposter

1128
01:24:47.480 --> 01:24:50.316
who sold nonexistent property.

1129
01:24:50.733 --> 01:24:52.735
And what did that dummy do ?

1130
01:24:52.986 --> 01:24:57.365
She lost her head for him,
and he brought us to our knees !


1131
01:24:57.490 --> 01:25:02.453
She signed anything
that crook put under her nose.


1132
01:25:02.620 --> 01:25:06.708
She got hit with two counts
of bankruptcy fraud


1133
01:25:07.500 --> 01:25:11.963
and the family patrimony was drained
from all the fines.


1134
01:25:12.755 --> 01:25:17.385
We've been reduced to renting out
our home for Italian movies...


1135
01:25:17.510 --> 01:25:19.262
Can you imagine ?

1136
01:25:19.887 --> 01:25:24.517
And every time she comes back here,
repentant and dejected.


1137
01:25:25.351 --> 01:25:28.896
But enough's enough,
I have no pity left for her.


1138
01:25:29.022 --> 01:25:31.774
She should kill herself
and put an end to it.


1139
01:25:34.235 --> 01:25:36.279
<i>Go</i> in <i>there...</i>

1140
01:25:36.487 --> 01:25:40.617
and tell her to get a move on.
Goodbye.


1141
01:25:57.550 --> 01:26:00.011
I made it, I'm here !

1142
01:26:01.054 --> 01:26:03.681
- It's you ?
- Yes, it's me.


1143
01:26:03.806 --> 01:26:07.018
I ran away, can you believe it?

1144
01:26:07.185 --> 01:26:09.187
Can you believe it?

1145
01:26:09.312 --> 01:26:13.024
- I'm happy you've come.
- I've missed you.


1146
01:26:13.191 --> 01:26:16.027
I have a fever, I'm all achy.

1147
01:26:16.152 --> 01:26:18.571
Nonsense, sit up.

1148
01:26:20.031 --> 01:26:22.450
- My sciatica's acting up.
- You'll be fine.


1149
01:26:22.659 --> 01:26:24.827
It happens every time I come here.

1150
01:26:26.663 --> 01:26:30.458
- No, these are slippers...
- It's a zoo out there.


1151
01:26:30.833 --> 01:26:32.585
It's cool.

1152
01:26:32.794 --> 01:26:39.050
They're such clods... they put
fake camellias on the rose bushes.


1153
01:26:39.217 --> 01:26:41.052
Where's the other shoe ?

1154
01:26:41.219 --> 01:26:44.430
But those vintage cars are lovely.

1155
01:26:44.597 --> 01:26:46.724
Let's go see him.

1156
01:26:47.100 --> 01:26:48.226
Who ?

1157
01:26:49.560 --> 01:26:52.814
What do you mean ? Him.
You said you'd take me to him !


1158
01:26:52.980 --> 01:26:55.817
You wrote it here,
don't you remember ?


1159
01:26:55.983 --> 01:26:57.944
Are you blind ? Read it !

1160
01:26:58.611 --> 01:26:59.946
Come on !

1161
01:27:00.738 --> 01:27:04.117
Maraschini Mangiarana,
move it or I'll beat you senseless.


1162
01:27:04.242 --> 01:27:06.244
Has anyone ever beat you senseless ?

1163
01:27:06.369 --> 01:27:08.955
Well, I will if you don't move it.

1164
01:27:09.080 --> 01:27:12.375
Move it, ladies,
are you in scene 38 ?


1165
01:27:12.583 --> 01:27:14.877
Go to wardrobe, asap !

1166
01:27:15.086 --> 01:27:17.880
Wardrobe is this way, come on !

1167
01:27:18.464 --> 01:27:21.759
- Aren't you an extra ?
- She's a cutie.


1168
01:27:21.884 --> 01:27:24.595
Francesca wants to start
with the Lancia shot.


1169
01:27:24.762 --> 01:27:26.764
- Got a license ?
- Yes.


1170
01:27:26.973 --> 01:27:30.893
- We're actually leaving.
- We're in the Lancia Appia scene.


1171
01:27:31.102 --> 01:27:33.479
- Then go to wardrobe.
- We're together.


1172
01:27:33.646 --> 01:27:35.732
Shut up, dummy.

1173
01:27:35.898 --> 01:27:39.736
I'm thrilled we'll be in a cabriolet,
I adore cabriolets !


1174
01:27:41.529 --> 01:27:43.531
Are you in scene 38 too ?

1175
01:27:43.990 --> 01:27:47.618
When we say "action",
start the car and drive to the gate.


1176
01:27:47.785 --> 01:27:50.246
<i>Put her wig on, please.</i>

1177
01:27:50.413 --> 01:27:53.249
When we say "cut",
back it up to here.


1178
01:27:53.416 --> 01:27:56.002
Quick, before we lose light.
Clapperboard !


1179
01:27:56.169 --> 01:27:58.796
Easy on the gas,
this thing really flies.


1180
01:27:59.005 --> 01:28:01.924
Silence please. Ready ?
Camera !


1181
01:28:03.176 --> 01:28:05.762
- Rolling !
- Scene 38 take one !


1182
01:28:08.681 --> 01:28:11.809
- What's that idiot doing now ?
- Making movies.


1183
01:28:12.310 --> 01:28:14.312
She's no good.

1184
01:28:14.437 --> 01:28:15.563
Action !

1185
01:28:16.939 --> 01:28:18.816
You're a bunch of Fascists !

1186
01:28:19.025 --> 01:28:22.153
- Elsa, you chased them all away.
- I'll drive this time.


1187
01:28:23.404 --> 01:28:26.532
- Cut !
- Sorry, my bad.


1188
01:28:29.035 --> 01:28:30.787
"Go!
- Stop!


1189
01:28:32.705 --> 01:28:34.582
Stop !

1190
01:29:09.242 --> 01:29:11.744
What's going on ?

1191
01:29:12.245 --> 01:29:14.872
What's going on ?

1192
01:29:15.081 --> 01:29:17.708
<i>Don't know, hold on...</i>

1193
01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:19.836
Hold on !

1194
01:29:20.002 --> 01:29:22.880
We're out of gas, it's no big deal.

1195
01:29:23.256 --> 01:29:24.882
Come along.

1196
01:29:25.508 --> 01:29:28.845
- Down this street.
- Where ?


1197
01:29:29.262 --> 01:29:30.596
You can't stop here.

1198
01:29:30.763 --> 01:29:33.391
Be right back, we have something
important to do.


1199
01:29:33.599 --> 01:29:35.017
Are you crazy ?

1200
01:29:35.142 --> 01:29:38.271
According to some evaluations, yes !

1201
01:29:38.729 --> 01:29:40.147
Come on.

1202
01:29:49.866 --> 01:29:51.492
I'll get it.

1203
01:30:01.168 --> 01:30:03.546
- Mr. Bonanno ?
- Yes.


1204
01:30:04.881 --> 01:30:07.174
Hello, may I have a word ?

1205
01:30:09.135 --> 01:30:12.889
Sorry for disturbing you,
but I believe the time has come


1206
01:30:13.055 --> 01:30:15.558
to face an important aspect
of Elia's life.


1207
01:30:15.683 --> 01:30:20.187
- Our son ? And who are you ?
- I'll explain everything.


1208
01:30:20.396 --> 01:30:25.943
I feel Elia should meet his mother
and hear her side of the story.


1209
01:30:26.402 --> 01:30:29.447
His mother is here, inside the house.

1210
01:30:29.697 --> 01:30:33.075
- Is this about Donatella Morelli ?
- Yes.


1211
01:30:33.284 --> 01:30:38.331
Social services called this morning
to tell us she escaped.


1212
01:30:39.206 --> 01:30:41.584
Escaped... that's a bit much.

1213
01:30:42.084 --> 01:30:45.963
Are you in contact with Ms. Morelli,
where is she ?


1214
01:30:46.172 --> 01:30:48.591
I'm just trying to help out.

1215
01:30:48.799 --> 01:30:52.094
You should listen to me
for the good of your son.


1216
01:30:52.303 --> 01:30:55.598
I don't understand,
are you a psychologist?


1217
01:30:55.806 --> 01:30:59.226
I'm much more than that. Never mind...

1218
01:30:59.435 --> 01:31:02.355
May I have a word
with you as well ?

1219
01:31:09.862 --> 01:31:13.950
Do you realize
you may be committing a crime ?


1220
01:31:14.116 --> 01:31:15.242
Aiding and abetting.

1221
01:31:15.826 --> 01:31:17.745
Know where she is ?

1222
01:31:17.954 --> 01:31:20.998
If so,
you should inform the authorities.


1223
01:31:22.500 --> 01:31:25.503
You have the wrong idea about her.

1224
01:31:25.628 --> 01:31:30.591
I realize she can come across
as someone who's shady,


1225
01:31:30.758 --> 01:31:33.594
crude, boorish, ignorant,

1226
01:31:33.761 --> 01:31:36.764
primitive, almost beast-like
at first glance...


1227
01:31:36.973 --> 01:31:38.766
But she's not.

1228
01:31:38.975 --> 01:31:42.228
She's someone who is good,

1229
01:31:42.395 --> 01:31:45.147
humble, loyal, generous,

1230
01:31:46.273 --> 01:31:48.609
very romantic.

1231
01:31:48.776 --> 01:31:52.905
She is fragile because
her heart is literally broken.


1232
01:31:53.155 --> 01:31:56.659
And since the accident,
her life has been agony.


1233
01:31:56.867 --> 01:31:59.370
- Accident ?
- If you can call it that...


1234
01:31:59.537 --> 01:32:03.541
Let's be honest,
the law is on your side.


1235
01:32:03.749 --> 01:32:05.626
And if you so decide,

1236
01:32:05.793 --> 01:32:09.130
you can impede Donatella
from seeing Elia until he turns 18.


1237
01:32:09.296 --> 01:32:13.426
You might not know, but
these encounters did already occur,


1238
01:32:13.801 --> 01:32:15.928
for three years leading up
to the adoption.


1239
01:32:16.137 --> 01:32:17.680
Yes, of course.

1240
01:32:17.805 --> 01:32:20.641
In a municipal office,

1241
01:32:20.808 --> 01:32:22.810
in a room with two chairs,

1242
01:32:22.935 --> 01:32:26.022
under the scrutiny of psychologists
and social workers.


1243
01:32:26.897 --> 01:32:29.650
We realize it wasn't
the best of environments...


1244
01:32:30.151 --> 01:32:33.654
Yes, but Morelli violated the rules
every single time.


1245
01:32:33.821 --> 01:32:35.823
Because she tried to give him a kiss,
to caress him...


1246
01:32:36.032 --> 01:32:38.451
After the adoption became official,
she caused a fiasco.


1247
01:32:38.659 --> 01:32:42.204
Fiasco ? She just went into his class
to get a look at him,


1248
01:32:42.455 --> 01:32:44.290
she hadn't seen him in <i>2</i> years.

1249
01:32:44.457 --> 01:32:47.209
They assumed she wanted to kidnap him.

1250
01:32:47.460 --> 01:32:50.463
But this upsets Elia too much.

1251
01:32:50.671 --> 01:32:53.215
You know, when we got him

1252
01:32:53.424 --> 01:32:56.343
he couldn't stand up, couldn't sit still...

1253
01:33:18.866 --> 01:33:22.620
Elia, Giada, come eat,
I made fritters.


1254
01:33:23.120 --> 01:33:25.873
Then off to bed,
we're going to the beach early.


1255
01:33:33.964 --> 01:33:35.382
What did they say ?

1256
01:33:35.591 --> 01:33:39.011
We spoke for 30 minutes,
they seem like reasonable folks.


1257
01:33:39.220 --> 01:33:40.513
Can I see him ?

1258
01:33:40.638 --> 01:33:43.224
The wife has a different
Tuscan accent though,


1259
01:33:43.390 --> 01:33:46.852
perhaps from Grosseto or Maremma.

1260
01:33:47.019 --> 01:33:49.146
Can I see him or not?

1261
01:33:49.355 --> 01:33:50.773
No.

1262
01:33:50.898 --> 01:33:54.652
- What did you say for 30 minutes ?!
- Calm down.


1263
01:33:54.860 --> 01:33:59.281
There's a chance that
they'll think it over and contact me.


1264
01:34:00.157 --> 01:34:02.993
Contacts are important in life.

1265
01:34:03.160 --> 01:34:07.665
Now let's find some gas
and go back to the car.


1266
01:34:10.251 --> 01:34:13.754
On second thought, 
I'll call Pierluigi.

1267
01:34:14.380 --> 01:34:16.423
I'll have him come get us.

1268
01:34:16.549 --> 01:34:19.176
So you can finally meet him !

1269
01:34:19.385 --> 01:34:21.303
How does this work ?

1270
01:34:21.512 --> 01:34:23.681
You can ask for legal advice...

1271
01:34:23.889 --> 01:34:26.642
he is a real legal eagle.

1272
01:34:29.436 --> 01:34:32.815
Hello, Snuggles ? 
Honey, it's me.

1273
01:34:32.940 --> 01:34:36.068
I'm here with Donatella, my friend.

1274
01:34:36.694 --> 01:34:39.697
We're on the boardwalk in Viareggio.

1275
01:34:41.157 --> 01:34:45.661
If she appeals the sentence
will she be able...


1276
01:34:46.954 --> 01:34:48.789
Of course.

1277
01:34:49.039 --> 01:34:52.459
He's sending a driver !
We just have to wait !


1278
01:34:54.962 --> 01:34:57.464
What did you do ?

1279
01:34:57.965 --> 01:35:01.218
What did you do ?

1280
01:35:03.220 --> 01:35:04.722
I'm fine.

1281
01:35:05.598 --> 01:35:07.349
It's okay.

1282
01:35:07.933 --> 01:35:10.227
<i>Let's go sit down...</i>

1283
01:35:10.436 --> 01:35:12.855
get some ice in a cafe...

1284
01:35:12.980 --> 01:35:14.607
You okay ?

1285
01:35:14.732 --> 01:35:18.611
We are, but you're clearly not
with those outfits !


1286
01:35:18.819 --> 01:35:20.487
A <i>cafe...</i>

1287
01:35:24.617 --> 01:35:26.493
Cold beers.

1288
01:35:27.828 --> 01:35:31.624
Naturally, I have some Valium
I stole from my mom.


1289
01:35:31.832 --> 01:35:33.834
2 or 5 mg?

1290
01:35:34.501 --> 01:35:36.378
5 mg!

1291
01:35:38.005 --> 01:35:40.007
A cigarette.

1292
01:35:50.643 --> 01:35:53.896
- Why did I do it?
- You sure are a dummy.


1293
01:35:54.104 --> 01:35:56.273
Luckily, you have a hard head.

1294
01:35:56.482 --> 01:36:00.152
They say I'm too unstable
and they must take my son away.


1295
01:36:00.361 --> 01:36:02.154
They, who ?

1296
01:36:02.613 --> 01:36:05.908
Social services declare
"parental unsuitability".


1297
01:36:07.785 --> 01:36:11.538
Eight of them come to get him,
with police in tow.


1298
01:36:11.664 --> 01:36:13.415
Poor baby's sleeping.

1299
01:36:13.540 --> 01:36:15.793
They don't even let me change him.

1300
01:36:16.001 --> 01:36:19.004
They put him in an institution,
all by himself.


1301
01:36:19.171 --> 01:36:20.881
For a little while.

1302
01:36:21.048 --> 01:36:23.676
They say:
"Just wait, we have to decide."


1303
01:36:24.385 --> 01:36:27.137
- Who ?
- Them.


1304
01:36:27.304 --> 01:36:30.683
So I wait. I cry
every day but I wait.

1305
01:36:30.808 --> 01:36:34.561
They say I cry too much,
and have major depression...


1306
01:36:35.521 --> 01:36:38.315
"if you give him to me
I'll stop crying."


1307
01:36:38.524 --> 01:36:41.151
"No, you have always cried.

1308
01:36:41.318 --> 01:36:43.445
- You cried at school..."
- Me too.


1309
01:36:43.654 --> 01:36:47.700
They know it all: I cried
over homework, over my dad...


1310
01:36:47.825 --> 01:36:49.576
- In the elevator...
- Me too.


1311
01:36:49.702 --> 01:36:51.954
I cried when mom yelled at me
for crying.


1312
01:36:52.162 --> 01:36:53.414
Me too.

1313
01:36:53.580 --> 01:36:57.960
"All right, I have major depression,
so cure me.


1314
01:36:58.168 --> 01:37:01.547
- I was born sad, cure me."
- I was born sad too.


1315
01:37:01.714 --> 01:37:05.426
"Give me Elia. You won't
cure me by taking him away !"


1316
01:37:05.592 --> 01:37:08.721
In fact, kids instill a sense of joy.

1317
01:37:09.221 --> 01:37:12.599
So they say I can go visit him
in the institution.


1318
01:37:13.809 --> 01:37:17.479
And I go there every day, all day.

1319
01:37:17.604 --> 01:37:21.984
I feed him baby food, not meat though,
he only likes apples.


1320
01:37:22.443 --> 01:37:24.737
Elia and I laugh, you know.

1321
01:37:24.862 --> 01:37:27.489
But when I leave, he cries.

1322
01:37:27.698 --> 01:37:29.700
He cries like crazy.

1323
01:37:29.867 --> 01:37:34.330
He grips on to me, they have to
pull him off finger by finger.


1324
01:37:34.496 --> 01:37:38.459
I have to leave him there,
make him think that I want to leave.


1325
01:37:38.959 --> 01:37:41.003
They say I'm not getting better.

1326
01:37:41.879 --> 01:37:45.132
- I want to get better, I do.
- I want to get better too.


1327
01:37:46.967 --> 01:37:49.011
One day they leave us on our own.

1328
01:37:49.219 --> 01:37:53.390
So I take him out in the stroller
to see the Mardi Gras floats.


1329
01:38:02.608 --> 01:38:06.987
What a sight, everyone looks at us,
everyone's smiling.


1330
01:38:07.154 --> 01:38:09.406
"Isn't he cute ?
His name is Elia.


1331
01:38:09.907 --> 01:38:11.909
He's my son, I made him !"

1332
01:38:19.666 --> 01:38:23.545
All of a sudden I see him...
I see him there.


1333
01:38:24.171 --> 01:38:25.672
Him, who ?

1334
01:38:26.298 --> 01:38:27.549
Hi!

1335
01:38:27.758 --> 01:38:30.177
He's there with his real kids.

1336
01:38:32.054 --> 01:38:33.931
- What?
- Want to see him ?


1337
01:38:34.431 --> 01:38:36.058
- Look at him.
- Get lost.


1338
01:38:36.183 --> 01:38:39.186
- Look how cute he is.
- Quit trying to ruin my life.


1339
01:38:39.395 --> 01:38:42.189
- Just look at him.
- Quit trying to ruin my life !


1340
01:38:42.314 --> 01:38:45.067
He says "slut", and other ugly words.

1341
01:38:45.192 --> 01:38:47.152
"You fucked everyone.

1342
01:38:47.319 --> 01:38:49.655
He's not my son,
he's Seven Apples' son."


1343
01:38:49.822 --> 01:38:53.575
What do you want, money ?
Here take this, and this.


1344
01:38:53.951 --> 01:38:56.829
Now get lost
or I'll press charges, okay ?


1345
01:38:57.037 --> 01:38:59.665
- I'll press charges.
- You didn't even look at him !


1346
01:38:59.832 --> 01:39:03.043
I didn't want anything,
I didn't ask him for anything,


1347
01:39:03.210 --> 01:39:06.171
I just wanted to show him
how beautiful Elia was.


1348
01:39:06.338 --> 01:39:07.965
Fuck you !

1349
01:39:10.426 --> 01:39:13.429
I feel like crying but feel ashamed.

1350
01:39:13.595 --> 01:39:16.932
God, I feel so ashamed,
I feel like a fool.


1351
01:39:21.061 --> 01:39:24.857
I can't remember
how to get back to the institution.


1352
01:39:24.982 --> 01:39:27.317
I hop on a random bus.

1353
01:39:31.572 --> 01:39:34.700
Then I get off and walk and walk...

1354
01:39:35.701 --> 01:39:37.703
Fuck you !

1355
01:39:43.876 --> 01:39:46.753
In the meantime, 
Elia falls asleep.

1356
01:39:47.504 --> 01:39:51.633
I think "God, now they're going
to take him away forever."


1357
01:40:08.108 --> 01:40:12.529
I think about how much he'll cry,
how much I'll cry,


1358
01:40:12.738 --> 01:40:15.782
I think about how cruel people can be.

1359
01:40:31.131 --> 01:40:33.509
No more feeling bad all the time,

1360
01:40:33.675 --> 01:40:35.677
no more feeling bad.

1361
01:40:36.637 --> 01:40:39.640
I want to feel good,
we want to feel good.


1362
01:40:41.934 --> 01:40:45.687
We don't want to die,
we want to be together...


1363
01:40:45.938 --> 01:40:47.564
forever.

1364
01:41:28.564 --> 01:41:31.984
Later they call it attempted murder,
attempted suicide.


1365
01:41:32.109 --> 01:41:35.696
Words like that,
what ridiculous words.


1366
01:41:35.862 --> 01:41:38.240
But they don't understand a thing.

1367
01:41:40.617 --> 01:41:43.954
While we sink down, we are happy.

1368
01:41:45.747 --> 01:41:48.458
Luckily they rescued you.

1369
01:41:54.089 --> 01:41:56.758
We're so tired, the two of us.

1370
01:42:00.512 --> 01:42:03.265
We should get some rest.

1371
01:42:05.017 --> 01:42:07.102
I'd like to sleep for a month.

1372
01:42:07.269 --> 01:42:09.521
I'd say a year.

1373
01:42:12.149 --> 01:42:14.234
<i>Or even die...</i>

1374
01:42:17.738 --> 01:42:21.992
So my mom would finally be happy,
everybody would be.


1375
01:42:22.618 --> 01:42:24.411
Are you crazy ?

1376
01:42:26.788 --> 01:42:29.041
And what would I do ?

1377
01:42:31.877 --> 01:42:34.796
- You ?
- Good thing I have you.


1378
01:42:35.547 --> 01:42:37.674
- Me?
'You!


1379
01:42:37.799 --> 01:42:39.885
- You !
- Good thing you have me.


1380
01:42:40.052 --> 01:42:41.053
You !

1381
01:42:57.819 --> 01:43:00.656
Jesus, Beatrice, move it !

1382
01:43:07.829 --> 01:43:09.956
God, there they are !

1383
01:43:11.583 --> 01:43:13.293
Beatrice ?

1384
01:43:14.044 --> 01:43:16.797
Where's Donatella ?
Search the area.


1385
01:43:22.678 --> 01:43:26.807
You can both come back to Villa Biondi
with a new therapeutic plan.


1386
01:43:26.932 --> 01:43:29.559
I spoke to the judge,

1387
01:43:29.726 --> 01:43:32.604
no judicial psych hospital, no jail,
but no more mischief I


1388
01:43:34.481 --> 01:43:37.484
Listen to me, where is Donatella ?

1389
01:44:06.596 --> 01:44:07.973
Sorry.

1390
01:44:13.395 --> 01:44:16.273
Don't move her,
she banged her head !


1391
01:44:16.523 --> 01:44:18.650
- Call an ambulance.
- Hold on.


1392
01:44:19.609 --> 01:44:22.279
- How are you ?
- No ambulance.


1393
01:44:22.487 --> 01:44:25.031
You don't look before crossing ?!

1394
01:44:27.033 --> 01:44:30.412
- Don't move.
- Take it easy.


1395
01:44:31.037 --> 01:44:34.040
- Don't move.
- No ambulance.


1396
01:44:37.794 --> 01:44:39.755
- Any news ?
- An accident.


1397
01:44:39.921 --> 01:44:41.673
A lady walked into traffic.

1398
01:44:43.300 --> 01:44:45.510
Beatrice, get in the car.

1399
01:44:45.677 --> 01:44:47.262
Giancarlo, help her.

1400
01:44:48.805 --> 01:44:51.057
The ambulance is on its way.

1401
01:44:52.267 --> 01:44:55.437
Give her some space, all right.

1402
01:44:56.563 --> 01:44:59.274
- Isn't there another lady ?
- Right here.


1403
01:45:00.776 --> 01:45:02.819
She had a pink dress on.

1404
01:45:03.028 --> 01:45:06.281
The lady in the pink dress
who was right here...


1405
01:45:06.823 --> 01:45:09.159
where'd she go ? 
She was just here.

1406
01:45:19.169 --> 01:45:22.088
What a night, we had a blast.

1407
01:46:22.482 --> 01:46:24.484
- Hi.
- Hi.


1408
01:46:28.280 --> 01:46:29.656
How are you doing ?

1409
01:46:30.407 --> 01:46:32.409
<i>Uh... normal.</i>

1410
01:46:34.870 --> 01:46:37.038
<i>Normal...</i>

1411
01:46:37.622 --> 01:46:40.667
Well, you look pretty good for normal.

1412
01:46:45.672 --> 01:46:47.674
Do you know who I am ?

1413
01:46:48.550 --> 01:46:51.303
The lady who was hiding in the plants.

1414
01:46:56.057 --> 01:46:59.185
- You know when your back tingles ?
- Yeah...


1415
01:47:00.312 --> 01:47:03.189
That's me tickling you.

1416
01:47:04.274 --> 01:47:06.192
It tickles at night.

1417
01:47:08.069 --> 01:47:11.406
That means I think about you
even more at night.


1418
01:47:15.035 --> 01:47:17.579
I have sand in my bathing suit.

1419
01:47:23.209 --> 01:47:26.463
Hey you,
come in, it's not that cold !


1420
01:47:59.704 --> 01:48:01.247
You're great !

1421
01:48:29.275 --> 01:48:30.735
Where'll you go now ?

1422
01:48:31.653 --> 01:48:33.863
I don't know.

1423
01:48:34.030 --> 01:48:37.367
I'll go somewhere to get better,
so one day...


1424
01:48:39.619 --> 01:48:41.997
we'll be able to meet again.

1425
01:48:45.417 --> 01:48:49.295
I'm happy, you have a lovely family.

1426
01:48:58.013 --> 01:49:01.182
Elia, come play volleyball.

1427
01:49:01.307 --> 01:49:04.769
- What a drag, I'm so short.
- No you're not.


1428
01:49:06.438 --> 01:49:10.191
I'll come play on
Luca and Tommaso's team !


1429
01:49:12.152 --> 01:49:14.529
We're just late bloomers...

1430
01:49:18.324 --> 01:49:20.785
Giulia, do a good serve !

1431
01:49:22.579 --> 01:49:24.330
Serve strong !

1432
01:49:42.098 --> 01:49:44.809
Guys, zero to one in our favor!

1433
01:49:47.228 --> 01:49:49.230
Good job !

1434
01:52:07.118 --> 01:52:11.998
