1
00:07:18.601 --> 00:07:20.686
Shall we?

2
00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:22.063
Watch your step.

3
00:07:27.276 --> 00:07:29.111
- <i>La casa del amor.</i>
- Ah!


4
00:07:29.946 --> 00:07:32.281
I forgot how gorgeous this place is.

5
00:07:33.407 --> 00:07:35.243
I mean, look how good this looks.

6
00:07:35.326 --> 00:07:37.411
Where the fuck are all the flowers?

7
00:07:37.495 --> 00:07:38.329
What?

8
00:07:38.412 --> 00:07:41.749
I told April to buy
an inordinate amount of flowers,


9
00:07:41.832 --> 00:07:44.377
- and I don't see one flower.
- It's okay. It's fine.


10
00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:45.795
It looks beautiful.

11
00:07:47.255 --> 00:07:50.007
No, that-that...
That's not really what I had in mind..


12
00:07:53.094 --> 00:07:54.887
What are you doing?

13
00:07:54.971 --> 00:07:56.681
- I can yell at April later.
- No!


14
00:07:56.764 --> 00:07:59.976
- Baby, get these clothes off.
- No.


15
00:08:00.059 --> 00:08:02.520
No. Unpack first, okay? Please?

16
00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:04.230
- Unpack first.
- Why?


17
00:08:04.313 --> 00:08:08.901
Because I'm classy, and I would rather
the bedroom than the living room, and...


18
00:08:08.985 --> 00:08:10.236
No!

19
00:08:10.319 --> 00:08:13.155
You wanna see
if they bothered to stock the fridge?


20
00:08:13.239 --> 00:08:15.658
Yes, I'm checking.

21
00:08:15.741 --> 00:08:17.994
I will unpack the bags.

22
00:08:21.581 --> 00:08:25.042
What's the fucking point
of having an assistant...


23
00:08:29.088 --> 00:08:32.258
Uh, there's milk that's expired.

24
00:08:32.883 --> 00:08:33.968
Great.

25
00:08:34.051 --> 00:08:36.304
And orange juice that's open.

26
00:08:37.388 --> 00:08:39.640
Didn't you tell April
we were coming?


27
00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:42.935
Babe, I
-I
-I thought we discussed

28
00:08:43.019 --> 00:08:45.771
not yelling at each other
from across the house.


29
00:08:48.024 --> 00:08:49.066
Right. Yeah.

30
00:08:55.489 --> 00:08:58.242
It's fine. It just means
we have to go ourselves and...


31
00:08:59.368 --> 00:09:00.620
Is there no food?

32
00:09:01.537 --> 00:09:03.539
Babe? Hello?

33
00:09:04.332 --> 00:09:05.333
Babe?

34
00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:08.461
Are you not...

35
00:09:09.211 --> 00:09:10.811
Are you not answering
because I'm yelling


36
00:09:10.838 --> 00:09:12.923
or because you can't hear me... Holy fuck!

37
00:09:13.883 --> 00:09:15.885
I need you to
sit down on that couch.

38
00:09:16.427 --> 00:09:17.887
I'm not fucking around.

39
00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:20.348
Okay, but how about
you let go of my wife first?


40
00:09:20.431 --> 00:09:22.725
I'll let her go
when you sit on the couch!


41
00:09:22.808 --> 00:09:25.561
This isn't a negotiation. Sit down. Sit.

42
00:09:25.645 --> 00:09:27.647
- Okay.
- Okay, I don't want to hurt her.


43
00:09:29.106 --> 00:09:30.107
Sit down.

44
00:09:30.733 --> 00:09:33.402
- I'm sitting down.
- Good. Now you sit down.


45
00:09:33.486 --> 00:09:35.404
Not there. Sit over there.

46
00:09:36.489 --> 00:09:39.742
You're not gonna fuck with me either.
Do we understand each other?


47
00:09:40.451 --> 00:09:42.036
- Yes or no?
- You can talk to me.


48
00:09:42.119 --> 00:09:45.122
Can I help you with something?
Money? Is that what you want?


49
00:09:45.623 --> 00:09:48.709
Let me make that happen.
You don't wanna hurt anyone, right?


50
00:09:48.793 --> 00:09:50.713
You're not the kinda guy
that would hurt someone.


51
00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:53.255
You already know what
kind of guy I am?

52
00:09:53.839 --> 00:09:55.049
Is that right?

53
00:09:55.925 --> 00:09:58.552
That's not what I'm saying.
What do you want? Let me help you.


54
00:10:01.597 --> 00:10:03.057
What are you doing? Hey!

55
00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:05.142
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?


56
00:10:06.769 --> 00:10:09.021
- You don't need to...
- I'm trying to cooperate.


57
00:10:09.105 --> 00:10:11.107
- We have money.
- I'm trying to cooperate.


58
00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:12.817
- No one knows we're...
- Shh.


59
00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:15.820
I'm gonna tie your feet together
and you're not gonna move.


60
00:10:15.903 --> 00:10:18.364
You don't have to tie our feet.
We're not gonna move.


61
00:10:18.447 --> 00:10:21.951
- Were you on staff? Is that what this is?
- Not everybody works for you.


62
00:10:22.451 --> 00:10:24.453
Does it have to be so tight?

63
00:10:25.955 --> 00:10:26.956
Please.

64
00:10:27.039 --> 00:10:29.208
You're already cutting off my circulation.

65
00:10:30.376 --> 00:10:32.545
Hey! Hey!
Get your hand out of your pocket.


66
00:10:32.628 --> 00:10:36.424
Give me your phone. Both of you.
Put your phone on the table. Take it out!


67
00:10:36.507 --> 00:10:39.760
Put it on the table.
You too. Phone, out.


68
00:10:41.011 --> 00:10:42.346
Put it on the table.

69
00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:43.431
Okay.

70
00:10:46.434 --> 00:10:47.977
- Is this your only phone?
- Yes.


71
00:10:48.519 --> 00:10:49.603
That's my only phone.

72
00:10:50.312 --> 00:10:51.313
Yeah?

73
00:10:52.231 --> 00:10:53.941
You sure? Maybe I should check.

74
00:10:54.024 --> 00:10:55.024
Okay, okay.

75
00:10:57.027 --> 00:10:58.027
There you go.

76
00:10:59.822 --> 00:11:01.907
Great job. Now I gotta check her purse.

77
00:11:02.491 --> 00:11:03.784
See what you did?

78
00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:08.664
- You don't have to do that.
- Yeah? I didn't. Now I do.


79
00:11:11.292 --> 00:11:13.043
How the fuck do you open this?

80
00:11:14.128 --> 00:11:15.128
How does this open?

81
00:11:15.171 --> 00:11:17.006
- Is there a trick to the purse?
- No!


82
00:11:17.089 --> 00:11:18.507
There's a fucking clasp.

83
00:11:19.425 --> 00:11:20.426
I got it.

84
00:11:20.509 --> 00:11:22.678
Okay. You obviously...

85
00:11:22.762 --> 00:11:24.972
You... You want money, yes?

86
00:11:25.055 --> 00:11:27.266
I want to give you money, okay?

87
00:11:27.349 --> 00:11:30.269
I-I know I've got some cash
squirreled away here somewhere.


88
00:11:30.352 --> 00:11:32.396
We have some for emergencies.

89
00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:34.231
Yes. For emergencies.

90
00:11:34.315 --> 00:11:37.109
Now, we're never here,
so it's going to take me a second


91
00:11:37.193 --> 00:11:39.528
to remember where the fuck
this money might be,


92
00:11:39.612 --> 00:11:41.864
but I'm going to get it to you
and get you on your way.


93
00:11:41.947 --> 00:11:43.365
I
-I found your watch.

94
00:11:43.449 --> 00:11:44.450
Your Rolex.

95
00:11:44.533 --> 00:11:45.576
Yeah. I
-I see that.

96
00:11:45.659 --> 00:11:47.870
And in there, I found some money
in a hollowed-out book.


97
00:11:47.953 --> 00:11:49.872
- There's probably more...
- We have more.


98
00:11:49.955 --> 00:11:52.458
Yes. If there's anything else,
it's going to be in the office,


99
00:11:52.541 --> 00:11:55.961
so can I get up
and take you into the office?


100
00:11:56.045 --> 00:11:57.046
Slow.

101
00:11:58.714 --> 00:12:00.007
You okay, baby?

102
00:12:00.090 --> 00:12:01.509
- She's fine.
- Yeah.


103
00:12:02.384 --> 00:12:04.678
Okay. You can let go. Go.

104
00:12:05.429 --> 00:12:07.348
If you move, I'm gonna hear you.

105
00:12:07.431 --> 00:12:09.225
She's not going to move.

106
00:12:09.308 --> 00:12:11.188
It'll be all right, baby.
Just gimme one minute.


107
00:12:13.938 --> 00:12:17.066
I know we had a secret compartment
put in here somewhere.


108
00:12:17.149 --> 00:12:19.276
Hey! Do not try anything.

109
00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:20.360
I'm not.

110
00:12:21.195 --> 00:12:22.863
I'm trying to get you your money.

111
00:12:27.827 --> 00:12:30.162
You seem to know who I am, right?

112
00:12:31.038 --> 00:12:33.582
Is there something
you would like for me to call you, sir?


113
00:12:33.666 --> 00:12:36.001
Sooner we're out of here,
the better. Okay?


114
00:12:38.295 --> 00:12:40.464
Hey. Hey, look at me. Look at me.

115
00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:44.510
I'm gonna ask you a question.
You're going to tell me the truth.


116
00:12:46.387 --> 00:12:48.013
Is there a gun in this house?

117
00:12:49.265 --> 00:12:50.266
No.

118
00:12:52.309 --> 00:12:53.853
Is that it? Anything else?

119
00:12:54.562 --> 00:12:55.562
No.

120
00:13:03.779 --> 00:13:04.780
See?

121
00:13:05.823 --> 00:13:06.824
Gimme that.

122
00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:10.995
Go.

123
00:13:11.829 --> 00:13:12.830
Go.

124
00:13:19.295 --> 00:13:20.504
It's around 5,000.

125
00:13:22.256 --> 00:13:24.383
So, between my Rolex,

126
00:13:24.466 --> 00:13:27.428
the money you found in the office,
and that, I'd say you had


127
00:13:27.511 --> 00:13:30.347
a pretty successful morning
over at my house, huh?


128
00:13:31.599 --> 00:13:34.977
Anything else is gonna be
too big to carry or too easy to trace.


129
00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:35.978
So that's it.

130
00:13:36.061 --> 00:13:38.397
And you have our phones.
There's no landline.


131
00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:40.274
No landlines, no security cameras.

132
00:13:40.357 --> 00:13:43.068
And we don't have neighbors for miles.
We don't even know them.


133
00:13:43.152 --> 00:13:45.029
So, for us, it's
like you were never here.

134
00:13:45.112 --> 00:13:47.990
Exactly. We walked in.
Some shit was already missing.


135
00:13:48.824 --> 00:13:51.535
But not even enough
to... to file a police report.


136
00:13:55.956 --> 00:13:57.541
Put your hands behind your back.

137
00:13:58.500 --> 00:13:59.501
No.

138
00:14:00.502 --> 00:14:02.422
Lean forward
and put your hands behind your back!


139
00:14:02.504 --> 00:14:05.025
- Don't do that. Just go!
- Have you not heard a thing I've said?


140
00:14:05.049 --> 00:14:07.885
Yeah. I heard everything you said.
I'm not gonna leave you here


141
00:14:07.968 --> 00:14:10.128
to do whatever you want
the second I walk out the door.


142
00:14:10.179 --> 00:14:12.306
You walk out,
we forget you exist, end of story.


143
00:14:12.389 --> 00:14:15.225
- I'm gonna myself a head start.
- No one knows we're here.


144
00:14:15.309 --> 00:14:17.311
I don't fucking believe you.

145
00:14:23.192 --> 00:14:24.276
Goddamn it!

146
00:14:29.114 --> 00:14:30.866
Okay, so what now?

147
00:14:30.950 --> 00:14:31.951
Just walk.

148
00:14:33.327 --> 00:14:37.289
- Any direction?
- Yeah. To... To the right. This one.


149
00:14:46.757 --> 00:14:48.676
So, what is the plan here?

150
00:14:48.759 --> 00:14:51.136
The plan is for you
to shut the fuck up.


151
00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:53.931
Go. Straight.

152
00:14:57.893 --> 00:14:59.895
That's not really a plan.

153
00:15:05.109 --> 00:15:06.110
No, right here.

154
00:15:07.736 --> 00:15:09.738
Open the door. Get inside.

155
00:15:09.822 --> 00:15:10.823
What?

156
00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:13.617
Y-You're really gonna lock us
in the sauna?


157
00:15:13.701 --> 00:15:14.785
This is your plan?

158
00:15:14.868 --> 00:15:18.664
To lock us in the fucking sauna
for days on end with no food or water?


159
00:15:18.747 --> 00:15:20.040
It's not gonna be days.

160
00:15:20.124 --> 00:15:23.168
I'm gonna barricade the door
so it'll take a while, but you'll get out.


161
00:15:23.252 --> 00:15:25.629
This is the only thing
that's gonna work for us.


162
00:15:27.673 --> 00:15:30.050
No, I'm not in
the mood for a schvitz.

163
00:15:30.134 --> 00:15:32.094
It's not gonna be on. Get in.

164
00:15:32.177 --> 00:15:33.012
No.

165
00:15:33.095 --> 00:15:34.263
You're going to have to

166
00:15:35.055 --> 00:15:36.807
rack your brain for something else.

167
00:15:44.565 --> 00:15:46.775
I don't wanna hurt you
in front of your wife.


168
00:15:52.698 --> 00:15:53.782
Okay. Babe?

169
00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:02.583
Ow.

170
00:16:13.886 --> 00:16:15.721
You're not gonna know when I'm gone.

171
00:16:15.804 --> 00:16:19.224
I suggest you wait like an hour
before you start trying to get out.


172
00:16:19.308 --> 00:16:20.517
Mm-hmm, mm-mm.

173
00:16:23.979 --> 00:16:25.147
You know, uh, buddy,

174
00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:28.609
y-you're not getting
what I've been trying to tell you.


175
00:16:28.692 --> 00:16:29.985
No one knows we're here!

176
00:16:30.069 --> 00:16:33.113
I was scheduled t-to give
the keynote at CES this weekend,


177
00:16:33.197 --> 00:16:35.449
but I pulled out
at the last minute, okay?

178
00:16:35.949 --> 00:16:38.619
I pulled out to surprise her!

179
00:16:38.702 --> 00:16:43.123
I moved fucking mountains
to change my schedule for her!


180
00:16:43.207 --> 00:16:45.417
- And then you fucking showed up.
- For us.


181
00:16:45.501 --> 00:16:46.877
- What?
- For us.


182
00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:49.755
For us! Yes, that's
what I said. For us!

183
00:16:49.838 --> 00:16:54.301
Which I did gladly so we could have
a little fucking alone time! Okay?


184
00:16:54.384 --> 00:16:56.011
Enjoy the alone time, then.

185
00:17:01.433 --> 00:17:05.104
I'm gonna fucking kill him.
I'm... I'm just gonna... I'm gonna fucking...


186
00:17:06.772 --> 00:17:07.772
Fuck!

187
00:17:13.695 --> 00:17:14.696
Hey!

188
00:17:19.743 --> 00:17:21.662
Hey! Fuck!

189
00:17:25.290 --> 00:17:27.167
I really don't think he had a gun.

190
00:19:18.278 --> 00:19:19.404
Okay.

191
00:20:03.615 --> 00:20:04.616
Fuck!

192
00:20:32.436 --> 00:20:33.436
Okay.

193
00:20:49.911 --> 00:20:51.705
Hurry! Come on, come on.

194
00:20:52.497 --> 00:20:53.332
Hey!

195
00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:55.917
Hey, stop!

196
00:21:15.562 --> 00:21:17.522
Stop! Stop!

197
00:21:31.495 --> 00:21:32.495
Fuck.

198
00:22:05.153 --> 00:22:08.490
I'm gonna fucking get you! Stop! Stop!

199
00:22:08.573 --> 00:22:10.200
Stop, sto...

200
00:22:10.283 --> 00:22:13.412
- Stop, what the fuck!
- I win! I got you. Just stop.


201
00:22:13.495 --> 00:22:17.249
Don't make us run anymore.
Any way you go, I'm gonna get you.


202
00:22:17.332 --> 00:22:19.042
Just stop. Stop.

203
00:22:19.126 --> 00:22:21.378
Or... No.

204
00:22:22.087 --> 00:22:24.005
Stop. Stay down. Stay down.

205
00:22:24.089 --> 00:22:25.549
I'm not fucking around.

206
00:22:25.632 --> 00:22:26.633
Get her back here.

207
00:22:27.259 --> 00:22:30.595
- I've got him! Get back here now.
- Babe!


208
00:22:34.307 --> 00:22:35.475
Babe!

209
00:22:35.559 --> 00:22:37.060
I've got your gun.

210
00:22:45.819 --> 00:22:47.362
Whose camera is that?

211
00:22:47.863 --> 00:22:49.448
How am I supposed to know that?

212
00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:53.535
A-And are you sure
that what you saw was even a camera?


213
00:22:53.618 --> 00:22:55.620
Am I sure that... 
Yes, it was a camera.

214
00:22:56.288 --> 00:22:57.581
Where does it go?

215
00:22:57.664 --> 00:22:59.624
I have no idea.

216
00:23:00.125 --> 00:23:03.712
Also, you know as well as I do,
once something is recorded digitally...


217
00:23:03.795 --> 00:23:05.839
If it even was...

218
00:23:05.922 --> 00:23:07.132
It's just out there.

219
00:23:07.215 --> 00:23:10.302
There's nothing you can do about it.
It's not like a 7-Eleven


220
00:23:10.802 --> 00:23:14.014
where you can go in the back
and-and tear out a hard drive.


221
00:23:14.598 --> 00:23:16.600
Everyone's an idiot to you, huh?

222
00:23:16.683 --> 00:23:17.767
No, not everyone.

223
00:23:19.352 --> 00:23:21.897
- You lied to me.
- I'm not lying.


224
00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:25.108
We have no security cameras
on our property.


225
00:23:25.192 --> 00:23:26.860
Really? Just like there's no gun?

226
00:23:26.943 --> 00:23:31.364
Speaking of which, how about we establish
some... some ground rules on that gun?


227
00:23:31.448 --> 00:23:33.116
- Meaning what?
- Meaning I have no idea


228
00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:34.951
how much you've used or been around guns,

229
00:23:35.035 --> 00:23:39.331
but if you're going to be pointing it
at one of us, you can point at me. Okay?


230
00:23:39.414 --> 00:23:41.249
I haven't pointed it at anybody yet.

231
00:23:41.333 --> 00:23:44.377
I know that. All I'm saying is,
we know you have a gun.


232
00:23:44.878 --> 00:23:46.254
We're not going anywhere.

233
00:23:47.714 --> 00:23:52.594
- And to prevent any fucking...
- ...oopsie-doopsies,


234
00:23:53.428 --> 00:23:54.513
just put the safety on.

235
00:23:55.931 --> 00:23:56.932
Safety's on.

236
00:23:57.682 --> 00:23:59.768
So, nothing accidental.

237
00:23:59.851 --> 00:24:02.646
Great. But the question remains,

238
00:24:03.355 --> 00:24:05.565
what do you want me to do?

239
00:24:07.692 --> 00:24:09.319
It's the same situation, guys.

240
00:24:09.402 --> 00:24:10.820
It's not the same situation.

241
00:24:10.904 --> 00:24:16.243
Not if my face is out there.
Not if I have to... hide from this.


242
00:24:16.326 --> 00:24:18.036
You think five grand is gonna cut it?

243
00:24:18.119 --> 00:24:20.622
All that's changed is
the amount you need, right?


244
00:24:22.165 --> 00:24:23.166
Am I right?

245
00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:28.380
We still all... All three of us,
we have to find a way through this.


246
00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:31.550
So it comes down to
how much and how soon.

247
00:24:33.843 --> 00:24:35.887
So... how much?

248
00:24:37.389 --> 00:24:41.643
To what? To disappear? Start a new life?
Looks like that's what it's going to take.


249
00:24:41.726 --> 00:24:44.104
So... you know...

250
00:24:45.855 --> 00:24:49.276
A hundred... A hundred...
Hundred fifty thousand dollars.


251
00:24:50.402 --> 00:24:52.112
What? What is so fucking funny?

252
00:24:52.195 --> 00:24:54.614
- Hundred fifty thousand?
- Hundred fifty thousand.


253
00:24:56.157 --> 00:24:57.576
You think that's enough?

254
00:24:57.659 --> 00:24:59.869
Yeah, I
-I think you're going to want more.

255
00:25:00.579 --> 00:25:03.873
If you were looking for
any reasonable quality of life,


256
00:25:03.957 --> 00:25:04.957
yes, that's right.

257
00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.294
Something tells me
that maybe you and I have


258
00:25:07.377 --> 00:25:09.838
some very different pictures
of quality of life.


259
00:25:09.921 --> 00:25:11.756
Oh, most definitely we do,

260
00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:15.302
but either way,
I don't think 150,000 is going to cut it.


261
00:25:15.385 --> 00:25:17.554
You're going to blow through it
like that.


262
00:25:19.514 --> 00:25:22.058
Double it, then. 
Three hundred thousand.

263
00:25:23.226 --> 00:25:27.939
Babe. Where was this cutthroat negotiator
when we were doing our prenups?


264
00:25:32.777 --> 00:25:34.779
Uh, anyway,

265
00:25:35.989 --> 00:25:37.699
one man's opinion,

266
00:25:38.783 --> 00:25:40.327
I think we're still too low.

267
00:25:42.287 --> 00:25:45.248
Great. Then let's, uh... let's add a zero.

268
00:25:46.499 --> 00:25:47.499
Three million.

269
00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:51.838
What are you laughing at?

270
00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:56.468
Well, n-now you're just...
You're sounding ridiculous.


271
00:25:57.052 --> 00:26:01.348
Excuse me. Aren't you worth
several billion dollars now or something?


272
00:26:01.431 --> 00:26:05.602
Whatever I'm rumored to be worth,
which is actually much more,


273
00:26:06.186 --> 00:26:09.522
that still doesn't mean
that I can just pick up a little red phone


274
00:26:09.606 --> 00:26:12.108
and withdraw however much money
whenever I want.


275
00:26:12.192 --> 00:26:13.610
That's not the way it works.

276
00:26:13.693 --> 00:26:15.945
Also, if I'm asking
for three million dollars,


277
00:26:16.029 --> 00:26:19.032
well, don't you think
that might set off a few alarm bells?


278
00:26:19.115 --> 00:26:21.576
Which isn't exactly
what you want, correct?


279
00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:24.454
Fine! Then what is...
What's the most that you can get?


280
00:26:24.537 --> 00:26:26.748
What's the... What is the max?

281
00:26:26.831 --> 00:26:28.083
You don't want the max.

282
00:26:28.166 --> 00:26:31.127
I want the f...
I want the max! What's the max?


283
00:26:31.211 --> 00:26:35.423
I'm the only one here
that has actually been inside a room


284
00:26:35.507 --> 00:26:37.425
with over a million dollars in it.

285
00:26:37.509 --> 00:26:40.720
Now, there are certain limitations
to that kind of money.


286
00:26:40.804 --> 00:26:44.849
Not only the amount,
but how much does that money weigh?


287
00:26:44.933 --> 00:26:46.976
How much can I physically carry?

288
00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:50.438
Do you have any idea
how much three million dollars weighs?


289
00:26:50.522 --> 00:26:51.523
How much?

290
00:26:53.108 --> 00:26:57.112
Well, I don't know the actual weight.
That's not the point.


291
00:26:57.195 --> 00:27:00.365
Point is that you have to think about
how much can fit inside one suit...


292
00:27:00.448 --> 00:27:01.574
Just tell me the amount.

293
00:27:02.450 --> 00:27:04.452
Okay? Just tell... Wh
-What's the...

294
00:27:06.204 --> 00:27:07.455
What's the number?

295
00:27:13.837 --> 00:27:15.547
Guys, I have to use the bathroom.

296
00:27:16.548 --> 00:27:17.548
What?

297
00:27:18.675 --> 00:27:20.093
I waited as long as I could.

298
00:27:23.096 --> 00:27:24.681
So, how we gonna do this?

299
00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:28.893
Hey, hold on.

300
00:27:30.019 --> 00:27:31.019
Hold on.

301
00:27:43.408 --> 00:27:45.243
This curtain stays open.

302
00:27:45.326 --> 00:27:47.829
Wait, what? I... 
I can't go like that.

303
00:27:48.872 --> 00:27:50.874
- What's the problem?
- Privacy?


304
00:27:52.542 --> 00:27:55.670
Okay. Uh... there's an option B,

305
00:27:55.754 --> 00:27:58.357
which is you pick a corner
of the living room and do your business.


306
00:27:58.381 --> 00:27:59.382
I'm fine either way.

307
00:28:00.425 --> 00:28:02.927
Tempting.

308
00:28:16.816 --> 00:28:17.816
Okay.

309
00:28:33.291 --> 00:28:34.291
Hmm.

310
00:28:35.627 --> 00:28:36.628
Got it.

311
00:28:37.295 --> 00:28:38.295
Yeah.

312
00:28:40.215 --> 00:28:41.216
So why me?

313
00:28:42.634 --> 00:28:47.222
I mean, other than the obvious reason,
why did you target my house?


314
00:28:47.722 --> 00:28:50.934
I think the less we know
about each other, the better, don't you?


315
00:28:52.769 --> 00:28:54.938
This does not seem random to me.

316
00:28:55.021 --> 00:28:58.274
It seems like you knew
there would be no security cameras...


317
00:28:58.358 --> 00:29:01.569
...and it seems you
expected us to be gone.

318
00:29:03.488 --> 00:29:05.406
Due diligence on your part.

319
00:29:06.074 --> 00:29:07.492
Much better.

320
00:29:26.719 --> 00:29:28.638
Four hundred fifty thousand.

321
00:29:33.059 --> 00:29:34.310
[man Let's round it up.

322
00:29:35.562 --> 00:29:36.646
Even 500.

323
00:29:37.689 --> 00:29:38.940
Just feels right to me.

324
00:29:40.441 --> 00:29:42.121
Okay, we could do that. 
But the problem...

325
00:29:42.151 --> 00:29:43.152
I
-I remember.

326
00:29:44.237 --> 00:29:48.324
If I'm having any trouble
carrying the extra 50, I'll, uh...


327
00:29:48.408 --> 00:29:50.243
I'll leave it in your pool.

328
00:29:58.042 --> 00:29:59.460
Half a mil it is.

329
00:30:04.299 --> 00:30:05.967
Let's go get you your money.

330
00:30:14.434 --> 00:30:15.435
It's working.

331
00:30:21.649 --> 00:30:22.649
Hey.

332
00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:25.153
Stay where I can see you.

333
00:30:31.951 --> 00:30:34.996
No, hey. Audio. Audio only.

334
00:30:35.997 --> 00:30:38.583
Every time I call on the computer,

335
00:30:38.666 --> 00:30:39.918
- it's on video.
- Yeah?


336
00:30:40.001 --> 00:30:42.128
Well, I don't care. 
Not this time.

337
00:30:43.546 --> 00:30:47.467
Have you ever called someone
for a quick emergency delivery of 500k?


338
00:30:48.635 --> 00:30:50.136
Yes. Just last week I did.

339
00:30:52.305 --> 00:30:54.599
Okay, look, I can get you the money.

340
00:30:54.682 --> 00:30:57.602
It will, however,
require a little fucking finesse.


341
00:30:58.436 --> 00:31:01.439
If I call and ask my assistant
to arrange this kind of cash,


342
00:31:01.522 --> 00:31:03.024
and don't do it face-to-face,

343
00:31:03.107 --> 00:31:05.109
that might seem a little suspicious.

344
00:31:08.529 --> 00:31:10.490
I'm gonna be standing right here.

345
00:31:10.573 --> 00:31:11.783
- Perfect.
- Right here.


346
00:31:12.283 --> 00:31:15.662
And if you so much as blink
in a way that I find questionable,


347
00:31:15.745 --> 00:31:17.747
we're gonna have a problem, okay?

348
00:31:17.830 --> 00:31:21.000
So, no... no nose-scratching.

349
00:31:21.084 --> 00:31:23.169
No, uh, no code words.

350
00:31:23.252 --> 00:31:25.672
Okay, Matt Helm. Copy that.

351
00:31:25.755 --> 00:31:27.298
Who the fuck is Matt Helm?

352
00:31:27.799 --> 00:31:30.051
Dean Martin?

353
00:31:32.178 --> 00:31:33.513
"Talk about a booby trap."

354
00:31:34.305 --> 00:31:35.305
You never seen that?

355
00:31:36.015 --> 00:31:38.518
Uh, just... just focus on
what we're... On this.


356
00:31:39.310 --> 00:31:40.937
All right.

357
00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:51.948
- April.
<i>- Hey! Wasn't expecting to hear from you.</i>


358
00:31:52.031 --> 00:31:58.121
<i>- How'd it go with the flowers?</i>
- Don't even get me started on the flowers.


359
00:31:58.204 --> 00:32:00.206
<i>- Um, all right.</i>
- Um...


360
00:32:02.375 --> 00:32:04.002
I have a situation

361
00:32:04.085 --> 00:32:08.172
that needs to be dealt with
quickly and discreetly. Okay?


362
00:32:08.256 --> 00:32:09.382
<i>Okay.</i>

363
00:32:09.465 --> 00:32:13.803
I need $500,000
delivered to me in cash here.


364
00:32:13.886 --> 00:32:15.888
<i>Five hundred thousand in cash?</i>

365
00:32:16.472 --> 00:32:17.472
<i>Okay.</i>

366
00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:23.062
- Debbie is back.
<i>- Wait, what?</i>


367
00:32:23.563 --> 00:32:25.440
<i>- Even with the NDA?</i>
- Okay, shut up.


368
00:32:25.523 --> 00:32:28.234
My wife is here, so
that's all I can say.

369
00:32:29.277 --> 00:32:31.362
But how quickly can
you get this to me?

370
00:32:31.446 --> 00:32:33.448
<i>Well, it's gonna be tomorrow.</i>

371
00:32:34.115 --> 00:32:35.700
- Tomorrow?
<i>- Yeah.</i>


372
00:32:35.783 --> 00:32:37.243
You can't get it to me today?

373
00:32:37.326 --> 00:32:38.494
<i>I don't see how.</i>

374
00:32:38.578 --> 00:32:40.872
How do you know
off the top of your head that you can't?


375
00:32:40.955 --> 00:32:44.125
<i>It's already 3:30. By the time I get
the paperwork together and process,</i>


376
00:32:44.208 --> 00:32:46.419
<i>- the bank won't even...</i>
- Okay! Fuck. Tomorrow.


377
00:32:47.503 --> 00:32:50.131
- Tomorrow when?
<i>- By tomorrow evening.</i>


378
00:32:51.591 --> 00:32:53.092
Tomorrow afternoon, okay?

379
00:32:53.176 --> 00:32:56.012
- Let's say tomorrow afternoon.
<i>- Okay. I'll get it done.</i>


380
00:32:56.095 --> 00:32:58.973
I want 400,000 in hundreds,
the rest in 20s.


381
00:32:59.057 --> 00:33:01.934
Single bag. We can use
the same PI as last time.


382
00:33:02.435 --> 00:33:04.437
Have him drop it off
outside the gate, okay?


383
00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:06.856
Send me a confirmation email
by noon tomorrow.


384
00:33:07.648 --> 00:33:10.651
Okay? You're going to give me
some nod of acknowledgment


385
00:33:10.735 --> 00:33:12.015
that you heard one thing I said?

386
00:33:12.070 --> 00:33:14.739
<i>- Yes. Okay. I'm on it.</i>
- Make it happen, April. Fuck!


387
00:33:15.907 --> 00:33:16.908
Debbie, huh?

388
00:33:19.744 --> 00:33:21.037
You're a real class act.

389
00:33:24.874 --> 00:33:26.209
You don't fucking know me.

390
00:33:27.627 --> 00:33:28.628
Go fuck yourself.

391
00:33:43.267 --> 00:33:44.310
No knives.

392
00:34:01.119 --> 00:34:03.830
What,
are we supposed to make small talk?


393
00:34:08.167 --> 00:34:10.628
Well, I-I mean,
you guys could talk to each other.


394
00:34:12.338 --> 00:34:15.466
- Or is that not something you're used to?
- Not at gunpoint, no.


395
00:34:17.051 --> 00:34:19.053
It's not like we
can ask you your name

396
00:34:20.304 --> 00:34:24.183
or where you're from
or what you do, or did, for a living,


397
00:34:24.267 --> 00:34:27.436
and, well, it's sunny out,
so the weather's covered.


398
00:34:28.187 --> 00:34:31.274
Hobbies and favorite color
probably are safe.


399
00:34:32.191 --> 00:34:33.651
Him, I've read plenty about.

400
00:34:34.694 --> 00:34:36.988
But you're a mystery,
so why don't you start?


401
00:34:37.071 --> 00:34:39.365
My favorite color's black.

402
00:34:39.448 --> 00:34:40.448
I can tell.

403
00:34:41.742 --> 00:34:44.537
What's this tattoo
you're getting removed on your foot?


404
00:34:45.079 --> 00:34:47.707
How about
you stop looking at my wife's feet, yeah?


405
00:34:48.207 --> 00:34:49.208
It was nothing.

406
00:34:50.334 --> 00:34:52.128
The tattoo was nothing?

407
00:34:52.712 --> 00:34:55.798
That was one of the ugliest tattoos
I've ever seen in my life.


408
00:34:56.757 --> 00:34:58.968
Yeah, I know.
You've made that pretty clear.


409
00:35:01.637 --> 00:35:02.680
Yikes.

410
00:35:05.308 --> 00:35:07.810
Let's keep, uh, spinning this wheel.

411
00:35:07.894 --> 00:35:09.145
How'd you two meet?

412
00:35:11.564 --> 00:35:12.565
Honey?

413
00:35:15.651 --> 00:35:18.112
Um, we met at a fundraiser.

414
00:35:18.196 --> 00:35:20.448
- Cystic fibrosis.
- Muscular dystrophy.


415
00:35:21.616 --> 00:35:23.451
Back when I was an assistant.

416
00:35:23.534 --> 00:35:24.535
Ah.

417
00:35:25.161 --> 00:35:26.161
Got it.

418
00:35:26.996 --> 00:35:28.164
You were his assistant.

419
00:35:28.748 --> 00:35:31.876
No. Not his assistant, an assistant.

420
00:35:31.959 --> 00:35:33.461
The route most people take.

421
00:35:33.961 --> 00:35:36.881
Unless, of course, you've made a fortune

422
00:35:36.964 --> 00:35:38.966
or rob people in their homes.

423
00:35:39.592 --> 00:35:41.260
Or work for your husband.

424
00:35:41.344 --> 00:35:42.553
I work with him.

425
00:35:43.137 --> 00:35:44.931
Okay, I head up our foundation,

426
00:35:45.014 --> 00:35:48.184
a job I'm highly qualified for,
having worked for non-profits


427
00:35:48.267 --> 00:35:49.560
since before college.

428
00:35:49.644 --> 00:35:51.562
It's probably very similar,

429
00:35:51.646 --> 00:35:54.232
except now you just have
all this money to play around with.


430
00:35:54.315 --> 00:35:56.484
I'm not playing around with anything.

431
00:35:56.567 --> 00:35:58.277
It's... It's not a game, okay?

432
00:35:58.361 --> 00:36:00.363
And not that I have to justify
my resume to you,


433
00:36:00.446 --> 00:36:03.366
but now I'm in charge of building
schools and hospitals


434
00:36:03.449 --> 00:36:05.052
- on four continents...
- You are justifying.


435
00:36:05.076 --> 00:36:07.662
...so you can try
and belittle what I do all you want,


436
00:36:07.745 --> 00:36:09.080
but results speak for themselves.

437
00:36:09.163 --> 00:36:11.415
And you can go ahead
and question my motives,


438
00:36:11.499 --> 00:36:14.752
but at least I know what I'll be doing
for the next 4 or 5 years.


439
00:36:16.754 --> 00:36:18.172
That's not exactly true.

440
00:36:18.965 --> 00:36:20.883
You'll be taking on
more of an advisory role


441
00:36:20.967 --> 00:36:21.968
once we have a baby.

442
00:36:24.053 --> 00:36:25.346
Right, babe?

443
00:36:25.429 --> 00:36:27.515
Right. That's the plan.

444
00:36:50.371 --> 00:36:52.748
Did I or one
of my companies do something

445
00:36:52.832 --> 00:36:55.918
to harm or offend you personally
in some way?


446
00:36:59.964 --> 00:37:01.632
It really feels like you hate me.

447
00:37:02.133 --> 00:37:03.134
Huh.

448
00:37:05.761 --> 00:37:10.766
I don't fucking get it.
How can people be so mad at me?


449
00:37:12.184 --> 00:37:15.479
It's like fucking being mad at
a fucking clock.


450
00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:18.816
If you're mad at a clock,
that's really on you.


451
00:37:18.899 --> 00:37:20.151
It's not about the clock.

452
00:37:21.319 --> 00:37:26.782
I'm supposed to apologize for writing
an algorithm that was inevitable


453
00:37:27.658 --> 00:37:33.039
and that saves companies and enriches
the lives of hundreds of employees?


454
00:37:35.374 --> 00:37:37.543
- Did I say something funny?
- Yeah.


455
00:37:37.626 --> 00:37:41.630
Hearing you talk about
enriching people's lives is funny to me.


456
00:37:42.340 --> 00:37:43.507
Do I not do that?

457
00:37:44.925 --> 00:37:47.803
You know,
it's really pretty fucking rudimentary.


458
00:37:47.887 --> 00:37:52.058
A bloated, fat company dies,
all jobs lost.


459
00:37:52.141 --> 00:37:56.228
Or a leaner, more efficient version
of that same company survives,


460
00:37:56.312 --> 00:37:57.480
some jobs survive.

461
00:37:58.397 --> 00:38:03.986
If anything, I'm helping people find
a new career path that's more sustainable.


462
00:38:04.904 --> 00:38:06.989
But you, however...

463
00:38:07.990 --> 00:38:11.619
You are here for the sole purpose
of enriching yourself.


464
00:38:12.119 --> 00:38:14.372
You have no idea what I'm here for,

465
00:38:14.455 --> 00:38:16.457
or even if that
money is just for me.

466
00:38:18.084 --> 00:38:19.835
It's meaningless to you, anyway.

467
00:38:19.919 --> 00:38:22.338
Money that could change
any other person's life.


468
00:38:23.839 --> 00:38:27.802
I just doubt
you're going to give it all to the poor.


469
00:39:01.335 --> 00:39:02.461
Hey, what is this?

470
00:39:02.545 --> 00:39:05.297
- What does it look like?
- It's a Zen garden.


471
00:39:06.382 --> 00:39:09.677
Just like the little ones you see
on people's desks, but big.


472
00:39:17.935 --> 00:39:19.019
Last time I was here,

473
00:39:20.104 --> 00:39:24.525
I had the idea of putting in
a Mr. Miyagi-style fence, so it's in.


474
00:39:25.025 --> 00:39:26.026
Remember?

475
00:39:27.278 --> 00:39:29.363
Yeah. I still don't know what that means.

476
00:39:30.156 --> 00:39:32.158
A Mr. Miyagi-style fence.

477
00:39:44.670 --> 00:39:47.965
All right, guys. What's, uh,
what's up next on the agenda?


478
00:39:51.218 --> 00:39:53.721
What other shit
you have around here you don't use?


479
00:41:12.007 --> 00:41:13.008
Good work.

480
00:41:20.683 --> 00:41:22.434
You need to get close to him, babe.

481
00:41:22.518 --> 00:41:23.519
Win him over.

482
00:41:26.605 --> 00:41:27.940
What? What are you...

483
00:41:28.023 --> 00:41:29.942
We don't know this guy.

484
00:41:30.025 --> 00:41:33.696
We don't know what he intends to do
once he gets the money.


485
00:41:34.697 --> 00:41:38.576
So, you need to get close to him.
Do whatever it takes. Okay?


486
00:41:39.535 --> 00:41:41.996
- I don't...
- Do whatever it takes. That's it.


487
00:41:42.663 --> 00:41:43.664
You can do it.

488
00:41:46.417 --> 00:41:47.251
All right.

489
00:41:47.334 --> 00:41:48.961
Either of you have a preference?

490
00:41:49.962 --> 00:41:53.382
I still don't understand why you think
it's necessary to split us up.


491
00:41:53.966 --> 00:41:57.553
Yeah. Well, like I said,
for my peace of mind.


492
00:41:58.053 --> 00:42:00.723
So... why don't you go ahead and choose?

493
00:42:01.765 --> 00:42:02.766
Babe?

494
00:42:03.434 --> 00:42:05.686
- Do you have a preference?
- I-I don't care.


495
00:42:09.023 --> 00:42:11.191
Why don't you take this one over here?

496
00:42:12.026 --> 00:42:14.653
Not like either one of us
are going to sleep anyways.


497
00:42:17.114 --> 00:42:20.117
Just remember, I'll be right over here
the whole night, okay?


498
00:42:21.577 --> 00:42:22.578
Okay?

499
00:42:24.580 --> 00:42:25.581
Okay?

500
00:42:26.081 --> 00:42:27.082
Yeah.

501
00:42:29.460 --> 00:42:30.753
Doors stay open.

502
00:42:38.594 --> 00:42:41.555
- Shut the light off?
- If it helps you.


503
00:44:44.470 --> 00:44:46.305
Can't sleep.

504
00:44:48.891 --> 00:44:49.892
Okay.

505
00:44:50.893 --> 00:44:52.394
It's gonna be a long night.

506
00:44:57.232 --> 00:44:58.233
Yeah.

507
00:44:59.234 --> 00:45:02.029
Followed by a very long day.

508
00:45:09.745 --> 00:45:13.582
And the only man I know who could
fall asleep during his own kidnapping.


509
00:45:16.668 --> 00:45:20.255
I guess it's one of those "if you don't
laugh, you cry" moments, huh?


510
00:45:22.633 --> 00:45:23.634
Do you mind?

511
00:45:26.970 --> 00:45:28.472
No. I don't mind.

512
00:45:42.528 --> 00:45:45.739
Your life is gonna be
very different after tomorrow.


513
00:45:47.658 --> 00:45:51.578
My life became very different the second
you two walked through the front door.


514
00:45:54.039 --> 00:45:56.041
I was almost gone, too.

515
00:45:57.835 --> 00:45:58.919
I was leaving.

516
00:46:02.297 --> 00:46:03.632
Couldn't help myself.

517
00:46:08.595 --> 00:46:09.721
What are you gonna do?

518
00:46:16.186 --> 00:46:20.816
The end of the day,
everything being totally different,


519
00:46:20.899 --> 00:46:22.109
that's okay with me.

520
00:46:25.279 --> 00:46:27.906
- I get that.
- Oh. You do?


521
00:46:30.242 --> 00:46:33.453
I think everyone feels that
at least once or twice in their life.


522
00:46:36.748 --> 00:46:37.791
Do you?

523
00:46:39.334 --> 00:46:42.462
There was a time I didn't know
what I wanted to do with myself,


524
00:46:42.546 --> 00:46:43.839
like anybody else.

525
00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:48.468
Then you found your purpose with him, huh?

526
00:46:49.928 --> 00:46:51.930
He and I found it together.

527
00:46:53.181 --> 00:46:54.433
Picture perfect.

528
00:46:55.225 --> 00:46:56.560
Picture perfect.

529
00:46:57.311 --> 00:46:58.312
That's great.

530
00:46:58.937 --> 00:47:01.648
You guys are trying to have a kid?
That's what he said?


531
00:47:02.357 --> 00:47:03.358
We are.

532
00:47:03.942 --> 00:47:04.985
Congratulations.

533
00:47:06.612 --> 00:47:09.573
That takes any relationship
to a whole new level.


534
00:47:13.994 --> 00:47:17.497
Must be tricky if one person
is really rarin' to go


535
00:47:17.581 --> 00:47:20.751
and the other person
isn't quite as ready, right?


536
00:47:21.251 --> 00:47:22.628
Not my business, though.

537
00:47:22.711 --> 00:47:24.171
No.

538
00:47:24.254 --> 00:47:25.756
That's not my business at all.

539
00:47:27.841 --> 00:47:29.843
Like we said, picture perfect.

540
00:47:32.554 --> 00:47:33.555
What about you?

541
00:47:35.140 --> 00:47:38.143
You said before we didn't know
if the money was just for you.


542
00:47:38.977 --> 00:47:40.854
You're asking if I have a girlfriend?

543
00:47:42.189 --> 00:47:43.899
Or if there's anyone.

544
00:47:43.982 --> 00:47:44.983
Mm.

545
00:47:48.111 --> 00:47:50.364
You don't have to answer, obviously.

546
00:47:50.447 --> 00:47:51.949
Yeah. I'm not going to.

547
00:47:57.537 --> 00:47:58.664
You want that?

548
00:48:09.299 --> 00:48:11.301
It's a lot for you.

549
00:48:11.969 --> 00:48:13.971
The, uh, the money that's coming.

550
00:48:15.180 --> 00:48:16.348
It's a lot for anybody.

551
00:48:17.724 --> 00:48:18.725
Should be.

552
00:48:21.561 --> 00:48:24.898
The way he was able to get
that much cash together so quickly...


553
00:48:27.025 --> 00:48:29.861
He said it was
for another Debbie, didn't he?


554
00:48:38.161 --> 00:48:39.371
You know what? Fuck it.

555
00:48:41.915 --> 00:48:43.041
I'll take one.

556
00:48:43.125 --> 00:48:44.126
Oh.

557
00:48:48.755 --> 00:48:49.756
That's good.

558
00:48:57.639 --> 00:48:58.974
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.


559
00:49:08.025 --> 00:49:11.319
I'm supposed to be so grateful...

560
00:49:14.573 --> 00:49:16.450
and just take everything in stride,

561
00:49:17.576 --> 00:49:21.079
because... look at my life,

562
00:49:22.289 --> 00:49:23.832
and the good that I get to do.

563
00:49:25.667 --> 00:49:27.377
But, uh, the truth is, I...

564
00:49:29.171 --> 00:49:30.297
I miss my old life.

565
00:49:31.631 --> 00:49:36.678
I miss my friends,
and I miss... feeling normal.


566
00:49:36.762 --> 00:49:38.805
- Okay, I'm sorry. I just...
- And, um...


567
00:49:40.057 --> 00:49:42.976
I'm sure you're a nice person,
but you're not some victim.


568
00:49:46.313 --> 00:49:49.107
You're just a person who made a trade.

569
00:49:49.191 --> 00:49:52.319
You know that, right?
You're just like the rest of us.


570
00:49:53.278 --> 00:49:55.280
I knew I wasn't marrying just him.

571
00:50:00.786 --> 00:50:01.912
I can remember...

572
00:50:04.081 --> 00:50:06.833
on my wedding day,
everyone was just waiting.


573
00:50:09.211 --> 00:50:11.838
And I was standing there,
staring down at my feet.


574
00:50:14.257 --> 00:50:17.677
And if I went forward,
if I walked down the aisle,


575
00:50:17.761 --> 00:50:21.807
I knew exactly what would happen
in the next 30 or 40 years.


576
00:50:23.391 --> 00:50:24.392
I knew.

577
00:50:25.477 --> 00:50:28.480
And if I went back,
if I didn't walk down the aisle,


578
00:50:28.563 --> 00:50:30.732
I
-I wasn't sure what to expect.

579
00:50:32.859 --> 00:50:34.903
But it would have been mine.

580
00:50:35.904 --> 00:50:37.906
My choice and mine alone.

581
00:50:39.825 --> 00:50:41.701
Maybe for the very last time.

582
00:50:45.789 --> 00:50:46.790
I went forward.

583
00:50:48.708 --> 00:50:50.710
But if I'm being honest, I...

584
00:50:52.963 --> 00:50:55.882
I didn't know if I would
until I took that very first step.


585
00:51:01.179 --> 00:51:02.180
Well?

586
00:51:04.599 --> 00:51:05.600
Well, what?

587
00:51:06.309 --> 00:51:07.310
Was it worth it?

588
00:51:14.401 --> 00:51:16.403
Ask me again in 30 or 40 years.

589
00:51:22.117 --> 00:51:24.119
Um... all right, well,

590
00:51:25.287 --> 00:51:27.289
I, uh, I should get some sleep.

591
00:51:35.088 --> 00:51:36.089
Night.

592
00:52:44.741 --> 00:52:45.742
Thanks.

593
00:52:48.703 --> 00:52:50.789
I'll take a Bloody Mary, too. Thanks.

594
00:53:00.048 --> 00:53:01.466
Wrong side of the bed, love?

595
00:53:02.133 --> 00:53:03.343
Was there a right side?

596
00:53:32.580 --> 00:53:33.832
So, what company was it?

597
00:53:38.586 --> 00:53:39.586
Huh?

598
00:53:40.672 --> 00:53:42.132
You can't help yourself, huh?

599
00:53:44.718 --> 00:53:48.138
You were deemed... redundant,

600
00:53:49.306 --> 00:53:50.307
and let go.

601
00:53:51.725 --> 00:53:52.725
That's it, right?

602
00:53:53.393 --> 00:53:54.769
It's okay. You can tell me.

603
00:53:54.853 --> 00:53:56.646
I know what you're trying to do.

604
00:53:57.355 --> 00:53:58.356
Just drop it.

605
00:54:03.862 --> 00:54:06.656
Now, I owe you... something, right?

606
00:54:08.325 --> 00:54:09.993
If you owe a debt,

607
00:54:10.076 --> 00:54:12.495
it's to a hell of a lot more people
than just me.


608
00:54:13.538 --> 00:54:16.249
Because of your little math equation,

609
00:54:16.333 --> 00:54:18.668
people's jobs disappear
just like that.


610
00:54:18.752 --> 00:54:22.547
- Don't even have time to prepare.
- Prepare for what, exactly?


611
00:54:24.924 --> 00:54:26.760
Ask the coal miners

612
00:54:26.843 --> 00:54:29.721
if they're prepared for clean energy.

613
00:54:31.056 --> 00:54:37.187
There's this new thing going around,
this new trendy mentality, you know, of...


614
00:54:39.189 --> 00:54:44.694
"I exist. So, therefore, you owe me."

615
00:54:46.529 --> 00:54:48.198
Are you familiar with this?

616
00:54:50.283 --> 00:54:52.952
That is the very reason why we live

617
00:54:53.787 --> 00:54:59.167
in a world full of
lazy fucking loafers and freeloaders.


618
00:55:00.293 --> 00:55:03.546
They're too busy
sitting, bitching, and moaning


619
00:55:04.506 --> 00:55:08.385
that when they're confronted
with an obstacle, it's just...


620
00:55:09.469 --> 00:55:11.096
"I guess that's it."

621
00:55:15.975 --> 00:55:20.355
But I... recognized the opportunity.

622
00:55:21.231 --> 00:55:25.527
And I did something about it
every single fucking time.


623
00:55:27.445 --> 00:55:30.698
I didn't ask anyone for anything,

624
00:55:30.782 --> 00:55:34.744
and I didn't take anything
that wasn't fucking mine!


625
00:55:37.789 --> 00:55:40.250
Not everyone who needs help
is a freeloader.


626
00:55:44.462 --> 00:55:48.091
Babe, I was not referring
to you or your charity.


627
00:55:48.174 --> 00:55:49.801
It was not a personal attack.

628
00:55:49.884 --> 00:55:50.885
It is personal.

629
00:55:53.638 --> 00:55:55.640
I needed help. Okay?

630
00:55:56.766 --> 00:55:58.768
And you paid my student loans.

631
00:56:00.854 --> 00:56:01.855
Am I a freeloader?

632
00:56:03.356 --> 00:56:04.357
No.

633
00:56:06.651 --> 00:56:09.696
No, because you don't
think like that, do you?


634
00:56:13.241 --> 00:56:14.242
Do you?

635
00:56:20.582 --> 00:56:21.875
What the hell was that?

636
00:56:21.958 --> 00:56:23.460
Everybody, be quiet.

637
00:56:23.543 --> 00:56:24.836
Don't say a fucking word.

638
00:56:29.048 --> 00:56:30.425
It's the fucking gardener.

639
00:56:32.760 --> 00:56:34.095
Okay, get into the office.

640
00:56:35.263 --> 00:56:37.265
Get into the fucking office right now!

641
00:56:39.767 --> 00:56:40.767
Go.

642
00:56:41.102 --> 00:56:42.102
Move!

643
00:56:43.855 --> 00:56:47.066
Go. All the way to the back.

644
00:56:53.615 --> 00:56:55.735
You didn't say anything
about a gardener coming today.


645
00:56:55.783 --> 00:56:56.910
We didn't know.

646
00:56:56.993 --> 00:56:58.077
What's he doing here?

647
00:56:58.161 --> 00:57:00.747
I don't know.
We don't deal with that kind of stuff.


648
00:57:08.379 --> 00:57:10.131
He's coming. He's coming.

649
00:57:10.715 --> 00:57:13.468
Just... Everybody, be fucking quiet, okay?

650
00:57:26.606 --> 00:57:29.400
He's just gonna keep knocking.

651
00:57:29.484 --> 00:57:30.527
He sees our car.

652
00:57:30.610 --> 00:57:33.488
Just... Will you give him
a chance to tire himself out?


653
00:57:42.622 --> 00:57:45.083
- Want me to go talk to him?
- Yeah. Get rid of him.


654
00:57:45.583 --> 00:57:47.168
Fucking fix everything.

655
00:57:47.252 --> 00:57:50.630
Hey, we are this close.

656
00:57:50.713 --> 00:57:53.424
Do not fuck this up for us, okay?

657
00:57:58.304 --> 00:57:59.305
Hola.

658
00:58:01.057 --> 00:58:02.183
Hello, sir.

659
00:58:02.267 --> 00:58:05.770
I'm so sorry to bother you.
I, uh, I saw that... that you're here.


660
00:58:05.853 --> 00:58:08.356
Yes. We're here. 
How may I help you?

661
00:58:08.439 --> 00:58:11.818
Uh,
since you're not always here at home,


662
00:58:11.901 --> 00:58:15.780
I... I wanted to be able
to say thank you myself.


663
00:58:16.489 --> 00:58:17.490
You're very welcome.

664
00:58:17.574 --> 00:58:21.452
It's such a pleasure
to, uh, work on such a beautiful property,


665
00:58:21.536 --> 00:58:26.082
and I wanted to say to you
and to your wife, uh... uh, gracias.


666
00:58:26.165 --> 00:58:28.084
Ah, you're too kind.

667
00:58:28.167 --> 00:58:31.045
And it's nice to meet you, see you...

668
00:58:31.129 --> 00:58:34.257
- I don't mean to bother you...
- Gracias. I'll pass it along. No.


669
00:58:35.466 --> 00:58:37.385
- You're welcome.
- Shut up.


670
00:58:37.468 --> 00:58:40.763
Shut up. Go to the bedroom.
Both of you. Bedroom.


671
00:58:50.064 --> 00:58:51.983
How long is this
guy going to be here?

672
00:58:52.066 --> 00:58:54.235
Until he's done, I suppose.

673
00:59:46.079 --> 00:59:47.080
Shit.

674
00:59:49.374 --> 00:59:50.375
I think he saw me.

675
01:00:02.095 --> 01:00:05.139
- Hello again.
- I'm-I'm so sorry to bother you again.


676
01:00:05.223 --> 01:00:07.475
- Not at all. You remember my wife.
- Of course.


677
01:00:07.558 --> 01:00:09.143
- Señora.
- Hi. How are you?


678
01:00:09.894 --> 01:00:14.691
And, uh, this is her cousin.
He just flew in from Portofino.


679
01:00:17.235 --> 01:00:20.571
- It's nice you have family here.
- Yes. That's everything.


680
01:00:20.655 --> 01:00:22.198
Señor, while you're here,

681
01:00:22.281 --> 01:00:23.950
there's this one thing
I want to show you.


682
01:00:24.033 --> 01:00:25.660
It would just take one minute.

683
01:00:26.452 --> 01:00:28.454
- You know...
- No, how about we all go?


684
01:00:29.205 --> 01:00:31.374
- Oh. Okay, yes.
- Let's all go.


685
01:00:31.457 --> 01:00:34.585
- The more the better.
- Follow me. This way.


686
01:00:35.503 --> 01:00:39.132
- So, what are we looking at?
- I'll show you. Around the corner.


687
01:00:39.215 --> 01:00:41.467
Uh, you must have
had a really nice drive,

688
01:00:41.551 --> 01:00:43.803
because the, uh, weather has been so nice.

689
01:00:43.886 --> 01:00:46.597
- It was a beautiful...
- Hey, you know what, guys? Uh...


690
01:00:47.765 --> 01:00:49.993
We just put food in the oven.
We have to get back inside.


691
01:00:50.017 --> 01:00:52.270
That can wait.
What did you want to show me?


692
01:00:52.353 --> 01:00:54.564
I don't know
if you've been able to see this,


693
01:00:54.647 --> 01:00:58.943
but, uh, I designed and I-I built
and-and I put these planters here.


694
01:00:59.026 --> 01:01:03.865
Uh, it took me 18 weeks,
but, uh, I think it was worth it.


695
01:01:03.948 --> 01:01:06.993
And... next, I was imagining,

696
01:01:07.076 --> 01:01:08.619
with your permission,

697
01:01:08.703 --> 01:01:14.459
right here, a beautiful, beautiful
big oak tree, right in the center.


698
01:01:14.542 --> 01:01:17.628
- Huh.
- I did do a little, simple sketch for you


699
01:01:17.712 --> 01:01:20.256
to show you what,
uh, my vision is. Uh...

700
01:01:21.758 --> 01:01:24.385
It-It will take some time
for it to grow, of course,


701
01:01:24.469 --> 01:01:26.304
but I was thinking that, you know,

702
01:01:26.387 --> 01:01:28.681
this is not just something
for you to enjoy.


703
01:01:28.765 --> 01:01:31.017
Your children
and your children's children.


704
01:01:31.100 --> 01:01:32.101
Yeah.

705
01:01:32.894 --> 01:01:35.396
Our children's children, baby. Wow.

706
01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:36.981
That's... Wow.

707
01:01:37.064 --> 01:01:41.402
I think that's why I drew
my... my kids right here by the tree.


708
01:01:41.486 --> 01:01:43.529
- My boy and my girl.
- I see that.


709
01:01:43.613 --> 01:01:45.740
And I showed this
to the landscape person,


710
01:01:45.823 --> 01:01:47.033
but, um, you know...

711
01:01:47.116 --> 01:01:50.828
So, you're telling me
that you designed all of this


712
01:01:50.912 --> 01:01:52.205
and built this yourself?

713
01:01:52.705 --> 01:01:53.748
- <i>Sí,</i>señor.
- Wow.


714
01:01:54.415 --> 01:01:57.460
My friend, I have to say,
this is very impressive.


715
01:01:57.543 --> 01:01:59.295
- Thank you, sir.
- Beautiful work.


716
01:01:59.378 --> 01:02:00.254
It's very pretty.

717
01:02:00.338 --> 01:02:03.174
Well, uh, if you like it,
maybe you can sign off on it.


718
01:02:06.761 --> 01:02:07.761
Oh.

719
01:02:10.056 --> 01:02:11.265
Just the, uh...

720
01:02:11.974 --> 01:02:12.974
It's time to go inside.

721
01:02:13.017 --> 01:02:14.936
- The tree...
- Food's ready, love.


722
01:02:15.019 --> 01:02:16.312
- Right.
- Hey, now.


723
01:02:16.395 --> 01:02:17.688
Right.

724
01:02:17.772 --> 01:02:19.292
- In the middle...
- Thank you so much.


725
01:02:19.357 --> 01:02:20.584
- We have to go.
- Let's go back.


726
01:02:20.608 --> 01:02:22.902
There is one more thing on this side.

727
01:02:22.985 --> 01:02:24.695
We're gonna have to do that later.

728
01:02:25.321 --> 01:02:28.467
- Thank you. I'm sorry.
- It will only take a minute.


729
01:02:28.491 --> 01:02:29.492
Sorry.

730
01:02:33.621 --> 01:02:36.457
You could learn something
from this guy, buddy.


731
01:02:39.752 --> 01:02:43.422
He takes initiative,
he takes pride in what he does,


732
01:02:43.506 --> 01:02:46.175
and he does it all
with a smile on his face.


733
01:02:46.259 --> 01:02:47.259
Imagine that.

734
01:02:48.344 --> 01:02:51.305
Guy's a go-getter.
He doesn't wait around for permission.


735
01:02:53.057 --> 01:02:54.057
Hey.

736
01:02:54.934 --> 01:02:55.935
Hey, buddy.

737
01:02:56.894 --> 01:02:58.855
Got about eight hours left.

738
01:02:59.355 --> 01:03:03.568
Should we play
some board games or charades or...


739
01:03:03.651 --> 01:03:06.487
Hey, are you even listening to me, buddy?

740
01:03:09.282 --> 01:03:10.616
Do you not hear me?

741
01:03:15.371 --> 01:03:18.666
Wh-What should we do
for the next eight hours or so? Huh?


742
01:03:20.459 --> 01:03:22.962
Hey, excuse me,
can I talk to you for a second?


743
01:03:23.838 --> 01:03:24.838
Stop!

744
01:03:33.723 --> 01:03:34.765
I can't let you.

745
01:03:51.824 --> 01:03:53.910
Shit!

746
01:03:56.537 --> 01:03:57.538
Shit!

747
01:03:59.582 --> 01:04:00.583
This is on you.

748
01:04:01.459 --> 01:04:03.252
Not me. This is on you.

749
01:04:03.336 --> 01:04:06.589
You break into my house
and it's somehow my fault?


750
01:04:06.672 --> 01:04:09.300
- That's what you're saying?
- Why would you do that?


751
01:04:09.383 --> 01:04:12.678
I don't know. He doesn't live here.

752
01:04:12.762 --> 01:04:15.765
We don't know him.
Uh, I'm tired of looking at his face.


753
01:04:15.848 --> 01:04:19.977
Um... he has so many bright ideas,
maybe he decides he wants to tie us both


754
01:04:20.061 --> 01:04:23.481
to a fucking orange tree, babe.
We don't know what he's going to do...


755
01:04:23.564 --> 01:04:24.564
I would've left!

756
01:04:29.028 --> 01:04:30.029
I don't believe him.

757
01:04:31.948 --> 01:04:35.910
But my main priority
is to my wife, okay?

758
01:04:37.954 --> 01:04:39.163
Main priority?

759
01:04:40.915 --> 01:04:43.626
You did something that jeopardized me

760
01:04:44.418 --> 01:04:46.420
and him and him.

761
01:04:46.504 --> 01:04:49.715
All of us. You
-You chose for all of us.

762
01:04:49.799 --> 01:04:53.427
Okay. So, what are you suggesting?
That in that split second that it took


763
01:04:53.511 --> 01:04:58.015
for me to scribble down this note
that I lean over and-and consult with you?


764
01:04:58.099 --> 01:05:01.352
No, because you've never involved me
in any decision you've made.


765
01:05:01.435 --> 01:05:02.645
What made this any different?

766
01:05:02.728 --> 01:05:07.066
So, i-it's back to this.
I'm just a piece of shit, right?


767
01:05:07.149 --> 01:05:08.234
I'm a piece of shit.

768
01:05:09.694 --> 01:05:11.112
I'm just a piece of shit.

769
01:05:11.862 --> 01:05:17.118
I-I make one calculated risk
to try and protect us...


770
01:05:17.702 --> 01:05:19.745
Yeah. And how'd that work out for you?

771
01:05:22.123 --> 01:05:23.666
The fuck is happening here?

772
01:05:27.044 --> 01:05:30.047
Just hang tight, okay?
This will be over in a few hours.


773
01:05:34.927 --> 01:05:36.721
What happens in a few hours?

774
01:05:37.847 --> 01:05:39.432
He takes a lot of my money.

775
01:05:40.307 --> 01:05:41.434
I'm so sorry.

776
01:07:30.084 --> 01:07:34.296
Why do we keep pretending
that this guy is an actual threat?


777
01:07:53.816 --> 01:07:55.067
I'm going to leave now.

778
01:07:56.527 --> 01:07:58.070
Hey! No, no, no, no.

779
01:07:58.571 --> 01:08:01.282
Sit back down on the couch.
Hey. We're all tired.


780
01:08:01.365 --> 01:08:03.492
I'm being nice to
you right now. Sit down.

781
01:08:10.374 --> 01:08:11.667
What is this, really?

782
01:08:12.334 --> 01:08:13.335
Hmm?

783
01:08:14.712 --> 01:08:15.796
Do you wanna be me?

784
01:08:16.547 --> 01:08:17.548
Is that it?

785
01:08:19.508 --> 01:08:23.304
Because let me fucking tell you,
it's not all it's cracked up to be.


786
01:08:23.387 --> 01:08:25.514
Try being a rich white guy these days.

787
01:08:26.182 --> 01:08:29.101
Everyone always thinks
it must be real fucking nice.


788
01:08:29.894 --> 01:08:31.353
That's what you think, right?

789
01:08:31.854 --> 01:08:34.940
But you have no idea

790
01:08:35.024 --> 01:08:37.401
what I deal with every day.

791
01:08:37.484 --> 01:08:40.613
There's a fucking permanent target
on my back,


792
01:08:40.696 --> 01:08:46.702
and infinite nothing people out there
just waiting for me to fail.


793
01:08:47.203 --> 01:08:48.454
Fucking sucks!

794
01:08:50.915 --> 01:08:52.208
It's fucking pathetic.

795
01:08:53.042 --> 01:08:55.044
Th
-That's you, right?

796
01:08:55.127 --> 01:08:56.545
You're pathetic.

797
01:08:56.629 --> 01:08:58.172
Just leave him alone.

798
01:08:58.672 --> 01:08:59.673
What?

799
01:09:01.717 --> 01:09:03.802
Just leave him alone.

800
01:09:03.886 --> 01:09:04.887
Leave him alone?

801
01:09:07.473 --> 01:09:08.474
This guy?

802
01:09:10.768 --> 01:09:16.232
I've had to hold his hand
for the last 36 hours and help him rob me.


803
01:09:18.442 --> 01:09:19.568
Why? Why?

804
01:09:20.694 --> 01:09:23.197
Fucking why am I doing this? Enough!

805
01:09:24.365 --> 01:09:27.493
He just wanted to know
what it was like to have a little power


806
01:09:28.202 --> 01:09:30.246
in his fucking meaningless existence.

807
01:09:30.829 --> 01:09:32.331
Oh, I just... I don't buy it.

808
01:09:32.414 --> 01:09:33.749
You can't even act it.

809
01:09:33.832 --> 01:09:35.334
It's really sad. So...

810
01:09:38.212 --> 01:09:41.382
- I'm going to walk out the door.
- Sit on the fucking couch now.


811
01:09:45.219 --> 01:09:48.472
I just... I don't believe you.
I don't think you're going to do it.


812
01:09:48.555 --> 01:09:52.685
I don't think you're going to do it now.
I don't think you're going to do anything.


813
01:09:54.228 --> 01:09:55.229
Ever.

814
01:09:55.312 --> 01:09:57.523
In your entire fucking life.

815
01:09:58.649 --> 01:09:59.650
Because...

816
01:10:01.068 --> 01:10:04.029
- You listening?
- Just sit down on the fucking couch!


817
01:10:04.113 --> 01:10:05.364
You listening?

818
01:10:05.447 --> 01:10:06.448
Yeah?

819
01:10:06.949 --> 01:10:08.158
You're nothing.

820
01:10:09.910 --> 01:10:10.910
You hear that?

821
01:10:11.412 --> 01:10:12.955
Say it. Nothing.

822
01:10:14.331 --> 01:10:15.331
Nothing.

823
01:10:22.381 --> 01:10:23.841
Hey!

824
01:10:23.924 --> 01:10:24.924
Oh, fuck!

825
01:10:36.979 --> 01:10:37.979
Oh!

826
01:10:39.106 --> 01:10:41.859
- [husband Oh, shit! Oh!
- No, no, no, no. No.


827
01:10:42.568 --> 01:10:45.029
He's...

828
01:10:46.322 --> 01:10:47.323
Oh!

829
01:10:49.283 --> 01:10:51.160
Oh, shit!

830
01:10:52.786 --> 01:10:54.246
No. No, no, no, no.

831
01:10:55.164 --> 01:10:56.415
Fuck!

832
01:10:56.498 --> 01:11:01.253
- Okay. Okay. Oh, my God. Just don't move.
- Not fucking real. Not real.


833
01:11:01.337 --> 01:11:03.213
Not real. It's not real.

834
01:11:03.297 --> 01:11:04.882
- It's not real.
- Do something!


835
01:11:04.965 --> 01:11:06.258
What? What? What?

836
01:11:06.342 --> 01:11:09.303
I don't know! Just help me, please!
Come on, goddamn it!


837
01:11:09.386 --> 01:11:11.889
Why would you run through
a glass fucking door?


838
01:11:11.972 --> 01:11:13.974
No, no, no! Please!

839
01:11:14.058 --> 01:11:17.061
- Hey, fucking help me!
- What the fuck do you want me to do?


840
01:11:17.978 --> 01:11:18.979
Fuck!

841
01:11:22.316 --> 01:11:23.609
The guy's fucking dead.

842
01:13:45.501 --> 01:13:47.503
What happened was an accident.

843
01:13:48.879 --> 01:13:50.130
It was a terrible thing.

844
01:13:52.299 --> 01:13:54.760
And I know that you're feeling
the weight of it.


845
01:13:56.053 --> 01:13:57.053
We all are.

846
01:13:57.930 --> 01:14:00.849
But there's a... a huge difference

847
01:14:02.309 --> 01:14:05.604
between what just happened
and what you think you have to do next.


848
01:14:08.941 --> 01:14:10.484
Please don't cross that line.

849
01:14:11.485 --> 01:14:14.196
I
-I
-I can call someone right now

850
01:14:14.947 --> 01:14:16.865
that handles this sort of thing.

851
01:14:16.949 --> 01:14:20.035
I can fix a problem like this.
I can call someone right now.


852
01:14:20.536 --> 01:14:23.914
- Let me call someone. Let me call someone.
- Hey. Hey. Look at me.


853
01:14:26.333 --> 01:14:27.334
Look at me.

854
01:14:30.879 --> 01:14:32.339
You're a good person.

855
01:14:34.174 --> 01:14:35.175
I know.

856
01:14:35.842 --> 01:14:37.594
I know that you're a good person.

857
01:14:38.470 --> 01:14:40.722
But there's a step
that you haven't taken yet,


858
01:14:40.806 --> 01:14:42.015
and if you do,

859
01:14:43.392 --> 01:14:45.394
you'll never be the same again.

860
01:14:46.645 --> 01:14:47.645
Trust me.

861
01:14:50.649 --> 01:14:51.858
You're not a killer.

862
01:15:35.360 --> 01:15:36.361
Money's here.

863
01:15:47.289 --> 01:15:48.373
What are you doing?

864
01:15:49.666 --> 01:15:50.751
You're going.

865
01:19:42.274 --> 01:19:43.275
Babe?

866
01:19:48.280 --> 01:19:49.281
Babe?

867
01:19:54.077 --> 01:19:55.370
You okay in there?

868
01:19:57.205 --> 01:19:58.206
Hello?

869
01:20:01.918 --> 01:20:03.920
We're going to get out of here

870
01:20:05.088 --> 01:20:07.924
and then we'll go wherever you want, babe.

871
01:20:09.092 --> 01:20:10.135
We'll start over.

872
01:20:14.180 --> 01:20:16.558
We could go to the vineyard
and renew our vows.


873
01:20:16.641 --> 01:20:17.767
How 'bout that, huh?

874
01:20:19.644 --> 01:20:20.645
You like that?

875
01:20:23.857 --> 01:20:26.026
It's gonna be okay.

876
01:20:28.737 --> 01:20:30.864
Hello?

877
01:20:30.947 --> 01:20:31.948
Nothing?

878
01:20:47.172 --> 01:20:48.173
Goodbye.

879
01:20:50.759 --> 01:20:51.885
It was a rose.

880
01:20:53.595 --> 01:20:54.596
I'm sorry, what?

881
01:20:56.222 --> 01:20:57.223
My tattoo.

882
01:20:58.975 --> 01:20:59.976
It was a rose.

883
01:21:02.479 --> 01:21:03.480
And I liked it.

884
01:21:08.985 --> 01:21:10.070
I don't give a fuck.

885
01:21:44.771 --> 01:21:46.231
Hey, hey, hey. Hey!

886
01:22:25.603 --> 01:22:26.604
You were right.

887
01:22:30.984 --> 01:22:33.528
I wanted to know
what it would feel like to be you,


888
01:22:34.070 --> 01:22:35.070
and so I came here.

889
01:22:39.909 --> 01:22:41.411
And then you showed up.

890
01:22:44.873 --> 01:22:49.085
And deep down,
I really wanted you to be good,


891
01:22:49.169 --> 01:22:52.505
because then at least
things might make sense.


892
01:22:55.884 --> 01:22:57.886
Life might feel more fair.

893
01:22:58.678 --> 01:23:00.180
And then I saw you,

894
01:23:01.473 --> 01:23:02.473
the real you,

895
01:23:03.141 --> 01:23:04.726
and you're so disgusting.

896
01:23:08.021 --> 01:23:09.355
I feel sick.

897
01:23:11.816 --> 01:23:13.985
And nothing feels fair.

898
01:23:15.862 --> 01:23:18.364
You have everything, and I have nothing!

899
01:23:28.208 --> 01:23:30.001
At least you're alone, though.

900
01:23:30.502 --> 01:23:31.711
So I get to have that.

901
01:23:32.629 --> 01:23:33.629
Right?

902
01:23:34.547 --> 01:23:35.548
I can pity you.

903
01:23:38.051 --> 01:23:39.594
You're always gonna be alone.

904
01:23:42.555 --> 01:23:44.557
Because I know something you don't know.

905
01:23:48.978 --> 01:23:51.106
She has birth control pills in her purse.

906
01:24:48.204 --> 01:24:49.205
Babe?

907
01:24:50.248 --> 01:24:51.249
Babe?

908
01:24:52.125 --> 01:24:53.001
Are you okay?

909
01:24:55.044 --> 01:24:56.504
Fuck was that?

910
01:24:57.797 --> 01:24:59.591
The fuck just happened? Huh?

911
01:25:00.383 --> 01:25:01.383
Babe!

912
01:25:05.013 --> 01:25:06.014
Babe?

913
01:25:06.848 --> 01:25:07.848
Hey!

914
01:25:09.184 --> 01:25:10.185
Are you okay?

915
01:25:12.478 --> 01:25:13.479
What happened?

916
01:25:14.689 --> 01:25:15.899
Hey, babe!

917
01:25:20.528 --> 01:25:22.155
Did you just fucking kill him?

918
01:25:25.366 --> 01:25:26.784
You just fucking killed him.

919
01:25:28.119 --> 01:25:29.120
Didn't you?

920
01:25:36.085 --> 01:25:37.337
Holy shit, babe!

921
01:25:38.087 --> 01:25:39.714
Oh, my God.

922
01:25:39.797 --> 01:25:42.217
You fucking did! Oh, my God!

923
01:25:42.884 --> 01:25:44.344
Holy shit! Untie me.

924
01:25:47.639 --> 01:25:49.849
Baby, what are you doing?

925
01:25:49.933 --> 01:25:51.684
What the fuck are you doing?

926
01:25:52.268 --> 01:25:54.646
Untie me! Hey, come on!

927
01:25:54.729 --> 01:25:55.730
What the fuck?

928
01:25:56.439 --> 01:25:57.357
Are you gonna shoot me?
