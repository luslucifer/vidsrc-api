1
00:03:26.016 --> 00:03:27.309
And this is for you.

2
00:03:27.351 --> 00:03:28.935
All right. Thank you.

3
00:03:28.977 --> 00:03:30.061
Uh-huh.

4
00:03:30.103 --> 00:03:31.271
See you guys.

5
00:03:31.313 --> 00:03:32.439
Gotta go, buddy.

6
00:03:32.481 --> 00:03:34.899
See you later.

7
00:03:34.941 --> 00:03:36.234
See you.

8
00:03:36.276 --> 00:03:37.694
Bye, honey.

9
00:03:37.735 --> 00:03:39.404
- Love you.
- Love you.


10
00:03:43.574 --> 00:03:45.369
All right, here we are.

11
00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:46.953
- Are we ready?
- Yeah.


12
00:03:49.122 --> 00:03:50.707
Have a great day, baby!

13
00:03:50.748 --> 00:03:52.000
Bye!

14
00:03:52.042 --> 00:03:53.626
And you, my darling.

15
00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.262
- Kioki. Hi.
- Mary.


16
00:04:45.303 --> 00:04:46.971
So nice to see you.

17
00:04:47.013 --> 00:04:48.557
Dazzling as ever.

18
00:04:48.598 --> 00:04:50.141
I brought my new associate,

19
00:04:50.183 --> 00:04:51.893
- Darlene.
- Hi.


20
00:04:53.186 --> 00:04:54.521
You guys have a seat

21
00:04:54.563 --> 00:04:56.440
and I will get us
something to drink.


22
00:05:00.735 --> 00:05:02.153
Looks like you're keeping busy.

23
00:05:02.195 --> 00:05:04.948
Ohh... you know how it is...

24
00:05:04.989 --> 00:05:07.117
I mean, between
the school committees


25
00:05:07.158 --> 00:05:08.868
and then the twins' schedule,

26
00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:10.328
it's just... it gets so hectic.

27
00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:12.581
I don't know how I ever worked.

28
00:05:12.622 --> 00:05:14.541
We've had
a spectacular quarter.


29
00:05:14.583 --> 00:05:17.502
Delirium, as you know, is still
our best-selling series.


30
00:05:17.544 --> 00:05:20.547
So, you want to do a spinoff
and hire a ghost writer.


31
00:05:20.589 --> 00:05:23.467
You know how I feel
about this. Go ahead.


32
00:05:23.508 --> 00:05:26.052
Right. Well,
actually, along those lines,


33
00:05:26.094 --> 00:05:27.929
- we're stuck.
- We're struggling, Mary.


34
00:05:27.971 --> 00:05:29.598
The publishing landscape
has changed.


35
00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:31.600
We're going through
a massive transition,


36
00:05:31.641 --> 00:05:33.184
and could really use your help.

37
00:05:33.226 --> 00:05:35.479
What? Wh
-What is this?

38
00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.188
We have an offer for you.

39
00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:38.815
One I think...

40
00:05:38.856 --> 00:05:40.984
The numbers, they make sense.

41
00:05:41.025 --> 00:05:43.945
One more book in the series and
we can make it over the edge.


42
00:05:43.987 --> 00:05:46.864
- Get through the transition...
- Stop, stop, stop right now.


43
00:05:46.906 --> 00:05:50.243
Uh, this is not what I thought
we were meeting about.


44
00:05:50.285 --> 00:05:52.162
You mislead me, Kioki.

45
00:05:52.203 --> 00:05:54.539
I thought this was
something totally different.


46
00:05:54.581 --> 00:05:56.124
Mary, I'm just trying to...

47
00:05:56.166 --> 00:05:57.584
You've been
through this before,


48
00:05:57.626 --> 00:05:59.043
you're gonna
find a way out,


49
00:05:59.085 --> 00:06:00.086
I know you will.

50
00:06:00.128 --> 00:06:01.712
- Okay?
- Mary...


51
00:06:01.754 --> 00:06:03.214
Mary, I assure you, we...

52
00:06:11.556 --> 00:06:12.974
My apologies.

53
00:06:19.564 --> 00:06:22.150
Your check will continue
to arrive every quarter.


54
00:06:22.192 --> 00:06:23.901
Thank you.

55
00:06:23.943 --> 00:06:26.863
Must be nice...

56
00:06:26.904 --> 00:06:29.698
not to have to worry
about your children,


57
00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:32.160
whether or not they'll
have a roof over their head


58
00:06:32.202 --> 00:06:33.870
or a good school to attend.

59
00:06:33.911 --> 00:06:37.248
You're Mary Morrison,
best-selling author.


60
00:06:38.249 --> 00:06:39.876
Yet there was
a time when Mary


61
00:06:39.917 --> 00:06:42.212
couldn't even get one publisher
to read her work.


62
00:06:42.253 --> 00:06:45.215
So, she resorted to
writing salacious stories,


63
00:06:45.256 --> 00:06:47.800
and now gets to sit back
and rake in residuals


64
00:06:47.842 --> 00:06:50.011
without a single thought
to how she got there


65
00:06:50.053 --> 00:06:52.138
or who put her there.

66
00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:53.890
I am right, aren't I?

67
00:06:56.934 --> 00:06:59.145
You know nothing about me.

68
00:06:59.187 --> 00:07:01.231
You don't know what
you're talking about,


69
00:07:01.272 --> 00:07:02.857
and you should be fired.

70
00:07:26.548 --> 00:07:28.383
- Hey, babe.
- Hey!


71
00:07:28.425 --> 00:07:29.926
Wow, smells great! Hi, kids.

72
00:07:29.967 --> 00:07:31.886
- I made your favorite.
- Mmm.


73
00:07:33.096 --> 00:07:34.764
Hey, guys.

74
00:07:34.805 --> 00:07:36.182
- Hi, Dad.
- How was school?


75
00:07:36.224 --> 00:07:37.726
Good.

76
00:07:51.948 --> 00:07:53.617
What's this?

77
00:07:53.658 --> 00:07:55.868
I don't know.

78
00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:58.538
Weren't you gonna
tell me about this?


79
00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:00.707
It was just a meeting,
I didn't think


80
00:08:00.749 --> 00:08:02.542
- it was a big deal...
- No, not that.


81
00:08:02.584 --> 00:08:05.128
You weren't gonna
tell me about this offer?


82
00:08:07.547 --> 00:08:09.633
- But...
- That's more money up front


83
00:08:09.674 --> 00:08:11.384
than all your other books
combined.


84
00:08:11.426 --> 00:08:14.137
Baby, let's have dinner.
It's ready, okay?


85
00:08:15.138 --> 00:08:17.014
Kids, hey, go to the table.

86
00:08:17.056 --> 00:08:18.391
Hey, dinnertime.

87
00:08:23.772 --> 00:08:26.566
Honey, I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to keep anything from you.


88
00:08:26.608 --> 00:08:28.234
- I didn't even see this.
- I know,


89
00:08:28.276 --> 00:08:30.403
but you have to
seriously consider this.


90
00:08:30.445 --> 00:08:32.196
All right?

91
00:08:37.076 --> 00:08:38.328
I do?

92
00:08:38.369 --> 00:08:40.079
Do I get an A? 
Do I get an A-?

93
00:08:40.121 --> 00:08:41.956
B? B+? What is it?

94
00:08:54.969 --> 00:08:56.220
Hello.

95
00:09:34.342 --> 00:09:36.260
I have something
I need to tell you.


96
00:09:40.348 --> 00:09:41.558
Um...

97
00:09:42.767 --> 00:09:44.728
I messed up.

98
00:09:48.398 --> 00:09:51.108
Well, you know that proposal
Barry brought me,


99
00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:53.653
and he kinda taunted me
to go in with him...


100
00:09:53.695 --> 00:09:55.988
It wasn't my... He told me...

101
00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:58.949
...perfect time...
got in too early...


102
00:09:58.991 --> 00:10:01.035
...in over our heads...
I figured that...


103
00:10:01.077 --> 00:10:03.162
...it was before we ever...

104
00:10:03.204 --> 00:10:05.164
When?

105
00:10:05.206 --> 00:10:06.791
When did you make that trade?

106
00:10:12.004 --> 00:10:13.423
Um, six months ago.

107
00:10:15.425 --> 00:10:18.678
Six months ago and
you're just telling me?


108
00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:21.389
Tom! How much?

109
00:10:22.807 --> 00:10:24.475
Nearly half, I think it was...

110
00:10:25.685 --> 00:10:28.104
Nearly half of the reserves?

111
00:10:28.145 --> 00:10:30.774
Half of the reserves?!

112
00:10:30.815 --> 00:10:32.442
You... You promised me!

113
00:10:32.483 --> 00:10:35.361
You swore you
would never do that again!


114
00:11:18.738 --> 00:11:20.698
You're taking the offer, love.

115
00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:23.576
I don't know.

116
00:11:23.618 --> 00:11:26.162
You've never seen me
when I'm writing.


117
00:11:27.622 --> 00:11:29.248
Doesn't matter.

118
00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:31.459
After it's over,
you go back to normal, right?


119
00:11:39.091 --> 00:11:41.135
I turn into a different person.

120
00:11:43.596 --> 00:11:45.389
This could be the perfect thing

121
00:11:45.431 --> 00:11:47.099
to get your ass out the door.

122
00:11:47.141 --> 00:11:50.687
You could add momentum
to enter a new chapter.


123
00:11:50.728 --> 00:11:52.772
To do the things
that you want to do


124
00:11:52.814 --> 00:11:55.399
so you can create the things
you want to create.


125
00:11:57.485 --> 00:12:00.196
What you need
is a full-time sitter.


126
00:12:00.237 --> 00:12:02.573
Oh, what you
mean to say is "nanny."


127
00:12:02.615 --> 00:12:05.785
Mm-mm. I did not spend
thousands of dollars


128
00:12:05.827 --> 00:12:07.161
to conceive those children

129
00:12:07.203 --> 00:12:08.746
just to spend thousands more

130
00:12:08.788 --> 00:12:10.832
to pay somebody else
to take care of them.


131
00:12:10.874 --> 00:12:13.877
I have a client, she's
a headhunter for sitters.


132
00:12:13.918 --> 00:12:15.378
Mm-hmm?

133
00:12:15.419 --> 00:12:16.713
Here.

134
00:12:20.132 --> 00:12:21.718
Well, if she's so great,

135
00:12:21.759 --> 00:12:23.344
why aren't you using her?

136
00:12:23.386 --> 00:12:24.846
Well, I can't afford her.

137
00:12:24.888 --> 00:12:27.974
Plus, she only takes on
certain clients.


138
00:12:28.016 --> 00:12:29.600
Oh, hell, no!

139
00:12:29.642 --> 00:12:32.854
No, those kids always
end up with problems.


140
00:12:32.896 --> 00:12:35.439
I only work at the office
three days a week,


141
00:12:35.481 --> 00:12:37.775
but if I had to work full-time,

142
00:12:37.817 --> 00:12:39.694
this is what I would use
for child care.


143
00:12:39.736 --> 00:12:41.821
The girls she recruits,
they're different.


144
00:12:41.863 --> 00:12:43.364
They go to ivy league schools,

145
00:12:43.406 --> 00:12:45.199
they're fluent in
at least two languages,


146
00:12:45.241 --> 00:12:47.451
they cook, they clean,
run errands, everything.


147
00:12:47.493 --> 00:12:49.119
I'm telling you, Mary,

148
00:12:49.161 --> 00:12:51.039
it's exactly what you need
to get through.


149
00:13:18.566 --> 00:13:21.151
- Welcome, Ms. Morrison.
- Thank you. Hi.


150
00:13:21.193 --> 00:13:22.946
Please sign in
and then have a seat.


151
00:13:22.987 --> 00:13:24.321
Angela will be
with you shortly.


152
00:13:24.363 --> 00:13:25.949
- Okay, thank you.
- Mm-hmm.


153
00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:37.125
Hi!

154
00:13:41.839 --> 00:13:43.716
- Hello, Mary.
- Hi.


155
00:13:43.758 --> 00:13:45.175
It's so nice to
finally meet you.


156
00:13:45.217 --> 00:13:46.844
- I'm Angela.
- Nice to meet you.


157
00:13:46.886 --> 00:13:48.638
If you come follow me,
I'll show you around.


158
00:13:48.679 --> 00:13:49.889
Sure.

159
00:13:51.348 --> 00:13:53.392
So, here we have
a little activity room.


160
00:13:53.434 --> 00:13:55.185
One of several areas
we have in the office.


161
00:13:55.227 --> 00:13:56.437
Wow.

162
00:13:58.856 --> 00:14:00.190
Of course, we have

163
00:14:00.232 --> 00:14:02.068
a state-of-the-art
security system.


164
00:14:08.992 --> 00:14:11.159
Most parents prefer to have
help inside the home,


165
00:14:11.201 --> 00:14:12.912
but should you ever
need to go out of town


166
00:14:12.954 --> 00:14:14.747
and want supervision,
we can provide it.


167
00:14:14.789 --> 00:14:16.373
I must say, Mary,

168
00:14:16.415 --> 00:14:18.001
I think you will be
very pleased


169
00:14:18.042 --> 00:14:19.585
with what we can offer.

170
00:14:19.627 --> 00:14:21.587
Our young women come
from impeccable backgrounds.


171
00:14:21.629 --> 00:14:23.673
Many of them are
attending prestigious schools


172
00:14:23.714 --> 00:14:25.883
and looking for creative ways
to pay tuition.


173
00:14:25.925 --> 00:14:28.552
We provide scholarships
based on performance.


174
00:14:28.594 --> 00:14:29.929
How about I send over

175
00:14:29.971 --> 00:14:31.848
a few potentials
for you to meet with?


176
00:14:31.889 --> 00:14:33.265
If none of them work out,

177
00:14:33.307 --> 00:14:34.600
we can revisit, go from there.

178
00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:42.066
Okay, why not?

179
00:14:42.108 --> 00:14:44.360
All right. I'll just get you
to fill out some forms.


180
00:14:44.401 --> 00:14:45.695
Okay.

181
00:14:47.196 --> 00:14:49.406
Oh, my God, I love your house!

182
00:14:49.448 --> 00:14:52.994
It has the best lighting ever.
It's great for photos.


183
00:14:53.036 --> 00:14:54.829
I recently got engaged, so,

184
00:14:54.871 --> 00:14:57.540
I'm kind of using this as
a learning curve for myself.


185
00:14:57.581 --> 00:15:00.376
And one little boy brother,
total monster.


186
00:15:00.417 --> 00:15:02.628
I'm so thankful for this
opportunity to be here,


187
00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:04.296
- because I love kids.
- Mm-hmm.


188
00:15:04.338 --> 00:15:06.632
And I'm just so excited
to share the word of God


189
00:15:06.674 --> 00:15:08.051
with your little lambs.

190
00:15:08.092 --> 00:15:11.137
And I'm also
a princess entertainer.


191
00:15:11.179 --> 00:15:13.347
- Okay.
- I actually have...


192
00:15:13.389 --> 00:15:15.599
my tail in the car.

193
00:15:16.934 --> 00:15:19.228
Yeah, so, I actually
have a niece,


194
00:15:19.269 --> 00:15:20.980
um, she's about
eight years old.


195
00:15:21.022 --> 00:15:23.024
I'm so happy because
when she was a baby


196
00:15:23.066 --> 00:15:25.776
she was gross.
How old are your kids?


197
00:15:25.818 --> 00:15:27.195
Hey, hon.

198
00:15:28.196 --> 00:15:29.822
How are the interviews going?

199
00:15:29.864 --> 00:15:31.199
No one impressive.

200
00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:33.617
But, I mean,
they're nice girls.


201
00:15:33.659 --> 00:15:35.161
Not one?

202
00:15:35.203 --> 00:15:38.206
Think you're being
a little hard on 'em?


203
00:15:38.247 --> 00:15:40.290
Maybe this
just isn't a good idea.


204
00:15:40.332 --> 00:15:42.043
Mary, I think you're anxious

205
00:15:42.085 --> 00:15:44.336
and apprehensive,
but you and I both know


206
00:15:44.378 --> 00:15:46.839
if you don't have any help
with the menial stuff,


207
00:15:46.881 --> 00:15:48.216
it'll absolutely kill you.

208
00:15:48.257 --> 00:15:50.051
Plus, it might be
good for the kids.


209
00:15:50.093 --> 00:15:51.552
I just can't picture anyone

210
00:15:51.594 --> 00:15:53.429
taking as good a care
of them as me.


211
00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:55.264
This isn't easy for me, either.

212
00:15:55.305 --> 00:15:59.643
You're the best mother.
No one can replace you.


213
00:15:59.685 --> 00:16:02.980
Oh, honey, wait. I think
another one's arriving.


214
00:16:03.022 --> 00:16:04.440
All right, bye.

215
00:16:09.528 --> 00:16:11.864
- Hello, hi!
- Hi!


216
00:16:11.906 --> 00:16:13.950
You must be
with Huntsman Enterprises.


217
00:16:13.991 --> 00:16:15.993
- Yes.
- Great! Come on in.


218
00:16:21.373 --> 00:16:22.541
Welcome.

219
00:16:22.583 --> 00:16:24.001
Thank you.

220
00:16:24.043 --> 00:16:25.669
I'm gonna make some tea,
if that's okay.


221
00:16:25.711 --> 00:16:27.504
- Yes.
- I've been at this all day


222
00:16:27.546 --> 00:16:29.215
and I just need
a little pick-me-up.


223
00:16:29.257 --> 00:16:31.008
- Have a seat.
- Oh, okay.


224
00:17:16.887 --> 00:17:18.597
So, you read a lot?

225
00:17:18.639 --> 00:17:21.142
Oh, uh, yeah.

226
00:17:21.184 --> 00:17:23.853
Sorry. Whenever I can.

227
00:17:23.894 --> 00:17:26.438
But don't worry, I would
never around the children.


228
00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:27.940
Oh, why not?

229
00:17:27.982 --> 00:17:29.817
Gosh, I think it would be
amazing for them


230
00:17:29.859 --> 00:17:32.278
to see a young person
reading an actual book.


231
00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:34.571
Lord knows we need
more of that these days.


232
00:17:35.906 --> 00:17:37.116
There you go.

233
00:17:37.158 --> 00:17:38.993
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.


234
00:17:39.035 --> 00:17:40.369
This is nice.

235
00:17:40.410 --> 00:17:41.620
Good.

236
00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:47.335
Oh, uh... Laddie,

237
00:17:47.376 --> 00:17:49.378
- by Gene Stratton-Porter.
- Stratton-Porter!


238
00:17:49.419 --> 00:17:53.174
Oh, yes! I read
A Girl of the Limberlost.


239
00:17:53.216 --> 00:17:56.344
But it was years ago, I...
Is this as good?


240
00:17:56.385 --> 00:17:59.471
Well, considering it's
my third time...


241
00:17:59.513 --> 00:18:01.640
- Yes.
- Wow.


242
00:18:01.682 --> 00:18:05.144
Porter has this knowledge
and passion for nature


243
00:18:05.186 --> 00:18:08.856
coupled with the rich girl-
poor boy romance


244
00:18:08.898 --> 00:18:12.526
set in the countryside of
the 19th century...


245
00:18:12.568 --> 00:18:14.486
You could say
I'm a little obsessed.


246
00:18:14.528 --> 00:18:16.239
There's this quote,

247
00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:18.366
the mother of
the main character,


248
00:18:18.407 --> 00:18:21.244
she hangs in the house.

249
00:18:21.285 --> 00:18:23.537
It has nothing to do
with the main plot, but...


250
00:18:25.081 --> 00:18:28.292
"The way to be happy
is to be good."


251
00:18:31.962 --> 00:18:34.464
I'm sorry,

252
00:18:34.506 --> 00:18:35.966
I realize
I've never introduced myself.


253
00:18:36.008 --> 00:18:37.634
I'm Grace.

254
00:18:37.676 --> 00:18:40.596
Hi, Grace, nice to meet you.
I'm Mary Morrison.


255
00:18:40.637 --> 00:18:42.472
So...

256
00:18:42.514 --> 00:18:45.434
tell me about yourself.
Where'd you grow up?


257
00:18:45.475 --> 00:18:48.520
Oh, uh, in a small town

258
00:18:48.562 --> 00:18:51.232
called River Springs. You've
probably never heard of it.


259
00:18:51.274 --> 00:18:53.984
Anyway, I grew up there
with a large family.


260
00:18:54.026 --> 00:18:55.986
Oh, excuse me.

261
00:18:58.488 --> 00:18:59.782
Sorry.

262
00:19:00.616 --> 00:19:02.076
Hi!

263
00:19:06.997 --> 00:19:10.000
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine with
all those conditions. Uh-huh.


264
00:19:11.501 --> 00:19:13.421
Well, that's wonderful.

265
00:19:13.462 --> 00:19:14.838
Great, great...

266
00:19:25.682 --> 00:19:27.517
Yeah... That's great!

267
00:19:27.559 --> 00:19:29.270
Great, wonderful news...

268
00:19:51.041 --> 00:19:52.876
Mom!

269
00:19:52.918 --> 00:19:54.462
Alex is being mean to me.

270
00:19:54.503 --> 00:19:56.630
No, I'm not. You're
just being a big baby.


271
00:19:56.672 --> 00:19:58.674
How is Alex being mean to you?

272
00:19:58.715 --> 00:20:00.343
Who are you?

273
00:20:00.384 --> 00:20:02.345
I'm Grace. I'm
a friend of your mom's.


274
00:20:02.386 --> 00:20:04.013
- Mom!
- Honey,


275
00:20:04.054 --> 00:20:06.515
your mom is on
a really important phone call.


276
00:20:06.556 --> 00:20:09.601
Is that a drawing?
Can I see it?


277
00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:14.315
So, then the elephant
says to the zookeeper,


278
00:20:14.357 --> 00:20:17.234
how dare you throw
mud on me like that?!


279
00:20:17.276 --> 00:20:19.111
And he got really angry.

280
00:20:19.153 --> 00:20:21.613
- Thank you so much, bye.
- So he took a big,


281
00:20:21.655 --> 00:20:23.991
deep breath and sprayed

282
00:20:24.033 --> 00:20:25.575
all this water on the zookeeper

283
00:20:25.617 --> 00:20:27.411
and the zookeeper
was drenched!


284
00:20:31.165 --> 00:20:33.167
Hi, guys, how was school?

285
00:20:33.209 --> 00:20:34.877
- Super awesome!
- Great!


286
00:20:34.918 --> 00:20:37.463
Good. Well, this is excellent!

287
00:20:37.505 --> 00:20:38.881
Wow!

288
00:20:38.922 --> 00:20:40.383
Can you guys
go play in your room


289
00:20:40.424 --> 00:20:42.176
while Grace and I
finish our meeting?


290
00:20:42.218 --> 00:20:43.635
- Sure.
- I'll be in soon.


291
00:20:45.262 --> 00:20:46.805
Ooh!

292
00:20:46.847 --> 00:20:49.266
I didn't realize Blume
wrote other stories.


293
00:20:49.308 --> 00:20:51.727
If this were a library,
I would check it out.


294
00:20:51.768 --> 00:20:54.438
Well,
if you like that one...


295
00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:55.981
follow me.

296
00:20:57.483 --> 00:21:00.194
Okay, I'm gonna pick
a really good book for you.


297
00:21:02.946 --> 00:21:04.823
Oh, this one's good.

298
00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:20.047
Wait, you're a writer?

299
00:21:20.089 --> 00:21:21.882
These are your books?

300
00:21:21.924 --> 00:21:24.510
Well, yeah, but I haven't
written in a while.


301
00:21:24.552 --> 00:21:28.472
I can't believe I'm
standing in the home


302
00:21:28.514 --> 00:21:30.682
of an actual writer!

303
00:21:35.145 --> 00:21:36.730
Grace, um...

304
00:21:36.772 --> 00:21:39.733
I don't know if I really
need someone full-time,


305
00:21:39.775 --> 00:21:42.278
but I definitely need
some help next week


306
00:21:42.319 --> 00:21:43.695
if you're up for it.

307
00:21:43.737 --> 00:21:45.406
Because I'm
starting a new book.


308
00:21:45.448 --> 00:21:47.074
Are you serious?

309
00:21:48.658 --> 00:21:50.202
That would be incredible.

310
00:21:50.244 --> 00:21:52.413
If you need to look
for something more full-time,


311
00:21:52.455 --> 00:21:53.914
I totally understand.

312
00:21:53.956 --> 00:21:55.999
No, no, no, this is perfect.

313
00:21:56.041 --> 00:21:58.001
- Okay, great!
- Thank you!


314
00:21:58.043 --> 00:21:59.295
Oh, thank you so much!

315
00:21:59.336 --> 00:22:02.089
Okay.

316
00:22:02.131 --> 00:22:03.715
Well,

317
00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:06.302
I will see you on Monday.

318
00:22:06.343 --> 00:22:07.761
See you on Monday. Thank you.

319
00:22:07.803 --> 00:22:10.013
You're welcome!

320
00:22:52.348 --> 00:22:53.932
She can't be real.

321
00:22:54.933 --> 00:22:56.602
I need to get me one of those.

322
00:22:56.644 --> 00:22:59.396
Oh, don't get too excited,
I only have her a week.


323
00:23:01.357 --> 00:23:03.651
She's cute, though.

324
00:23:03.691 --> 00:23:04.901
Hello.

325
00:23:04.943 --> 00:23:06.278
Mom, can we
go swimming, please?


326
00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:08.197
- Yeah, please, can we go?
- Please?


327
00:23:08.238 --> 00:23:10.491
I can take them, if you'd like.

328
00:23:13.076 --> 00:23:15.454
- Okay. Yes, okay.
- Yes!


329
00:23:15.496 --> 00:23:17.289
Oh, my, oh, my.

330
00:23:17.331 --> 00:23:19.124
Grace, do you want to
borrow a suit?


331
00:23:19.166 --> 00:23:21.210
I have one if you want to
try one of mine.


332
00:23:21.251 --> 00:23:24.296
- Yeah, that'd be great.
- Okay.


333
00:23:46.193 --> 00:23:47.819
Would you like a cover-up?

334
00:23:47.861 --> 00:23:50.322
- Yeah.
- Here you go.


335
00:23:50.364 --> 00:23:52.032
Thank you.

336
00:23:53.741 --> 00:23:55.411
- Let me help.
- Yeah.


337
00:23:57.705 --> 00:23:59.206
Whoa!

338
00:24:16.432 --> 00:24:19.685
The only one-piece you have,
and it just happens to be


339
00:24:19.727 --> 00:24:22.312
from the cover of
a Playboy swimsuit magazine?


340
00:24:22.354 --> 00:24:25.023
Oh, listen, I do not
need to worry about her.


341
00:24:25.065 --> 00:24:26.442
She is a prude!

342
00:24:26.483 --> 00:24:28.694
And you know what they say
about prudes.


343
00:24:34.991 --> 00:24:36.952
I have nothing to
worry about with her.


344
00:24:36.993 --> 00:24:39.204
I mean, if anything,
she needs my help.


345
00:24:42.666 --> 00:24:44.418
Hey, babe!

346
00:24:45.711 --> 00:24:47.463
Hey, nice to meet you, I'm Tom.

347
00:24:52.217 --> 00:24:54.386
I'm gonna go change
real quick.


348
00:25:13.113 --> 00:25:14.864
Bye, sweetheart,

349
00:25:14.906 --> 00:25:16.116
I'll see you tomorrow!

350
00:25:16.158 --> 00:25:17.909
- Bye, babe!
- Bye!


351
00:25:19.703 --> 00:25:21.455
- Wow!
- Mm-hmm.


352
00:25:21.497 --> 00:25:24.249
Well, what is this?

353
00:25:24.291 --> 00:25:26.918
Well, you tell me.

354
00:25:28.712 --> 00:25:31.131
I don't... I don't know.

355
00:25:45.312 --> 00:25:47.481
When's the last time
we did it in the kitchen?


356
00:25:47.523 --> 00:25:48.774
Oh, my.

357
00:25:54.946 --> 00:25:57.282
Mm, mm! Wow!

358
00:25:59.493 --> 00:26:01.787
- Mm. Right?
- Uh-huh.


359
00:26:06.583 --> 00:26:07.793
Come, come, come.

360
00:26:08.752 --> 00:26:09.961
Come.

361
00:26:25.018 --> 00:26:26.228
Yeah.

362
00:27:00.387 --> 00:27:01.764
Hi!

363
00:27:01.805 --> 00:27:03.557
If it's fine with you guys,

364
00:27:03.599 --> 00:27:05.975
I'd like to get them in the
shower and ready for bed?


365
00:27:06.017 --> 00:27:07.811
Oh, no, no, that's okay.
I'll do it.


366
00:27:07.853 --> 00:27:10.146
No, no. That sounds great.

367
00:27:10.188 --> 00:27:11.690
Thanks.

368
00:27:11.732 --> 00:27:13.859
Okay. Okay, great.
Come on, guys, let's go.


369
00:27:13.901 --> 00:27:15.360
Yeah.

370
00:27:19.823 --> 00:27:22.033
I have my girlfriend back, huh?

371
00:27:22.075 --> 00:27:24.286
Pretty fun.

372
00:27:35.963 --> 00:27:38.007
Okay. Okay, guys,
come on in.


373
00:27:40.009 --> 00:27:41.470
Okay?

374
00:27:42.596 --> 00:27:44.306
Ahh, yes.

375
00:27:44.347 --> 00:27:46.349
Mm, I am impressed.

376
00:27:46.391 --> 00:27:48.059
- Not bad, right?
- Mm-hmm.


377
00:27:52.481 --> 00:27:53.774
Oh, Grace.

378
00:27:53.816 --> 00:27:56.276
You wanna join us
for dinner, maybe?


379
00:27:56.318 --> 00:27:57.903
Oh, that's so kind.

380
00:27:57.945 --> 00:27:59.362
But I'm a firm believer

381
00:27:59.404 --> 00:28:01.323
that this is important
family time.


382
00:28:01.364 --> 00:28:04.952
They're in their room,
playing, ready for bed.


383
00:28:04.992 --> 00:28:07.704
Today was so fun.

384
00:28:07.746 --> 00:28:09.456
See you first thing
in the morning?


385
00:28:09.498 --> 00:28:11.166
Yes, thank you so much, Grace.

386
00:28:11.207 --> 00:28:13.502
- Okay, thanks. Good night.
- Good night.


387
00:28:17.881 --> 00:28:20.425
What?

388
00:28:40.403 --> 00:28:42.197
- Hi!
- Hi.


389
00:28:42.238 --> 00:28:44.032
I brought you some goodies.

390
00:28:44.073 --> 00:28:46.827
Grace, you did
not have to do this.


391
00:28:46.869 --> 00:28:49.329
You don't have to take care
of the kids and me.


392
00:28:49.371 --> 00:28:51.331
I know, but I like to.

393
00:28:51.373 --> 00:28:53.000
Please let me.

394
00:28:54.334 --> 00:28:56.586
Okay! It's adorable.

395
00:28:56.628 --> 00:28:58.922
Today's goal is the kitchen,

396
00:28:58.964 --> 00:29:00.089
tomorrow is the office.

397
00:29:00.131 --> 00:29:01.925
Wow!

398
00:29:01.967 --> 00:29:03.593
You are a godsend.

399
00:29:43.091 --> 00:29:46.011
Ooh! Ah!

400
00:29:46.053 --> 00:29:48.137
Ah! Ooh.

401
00:29:48.179 --> 00:29:50.015
Thank you, Grace.

402
00:29:51.767 --> 00:29:54.477
Ugh, I don't usually take
a bath at 11:00 in the morning,


403
00:29:54.519 --> 00:29:56.021
but I just thought
maybe it would


404
00:29:56.063 --> 00:29:57.689
get the ideas flowing,
you know?


405
00:30:01.902 --> 00:30:03.111
Ow! Ooh!

406
00:30:03.152 --> 00:30:04.821
Eee!

407
00:30:18.293 --> 00:30:20.503
You know what I think
we should do today?


408
00:30:20.545 --> 00:30:22.338
Play hooky.

409
00:30:23.381 --> 00:30:24.633
But what about...

410
00:30:24.674 --> 00:30:26.259
It'll all be here
when we get back.


411
00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:28.470
Come on.

412
00:30:30.513 --> 00:30:33.475
Here we are!

413
00:30:35.226 --> 00:30:38.229
Oh, this is too much, really.

414
00:30:38.271 --> 00:30:40.315
No, Grace, you deserve it!

415
00:30:41.608 --> 00:30:43.860
Um, excuse me.

416
00:30:43.902 --> 00:30:46.780
Could you fit my young friend
here for a new bra?


417
00:30:46.822 --> 00:30:48.531
Oh, no problem,
follow me this way.


418
00:30:48.573 --> 00:30:49.866
Okay.

419
00:30:56.748 --> 00:30:58.667
Okay. Be right back.

420
00:31:01.210 --> 00:31:02.671
I'm excited!

421
00:31:03.797 --> 00:31:05.173
Me, too.

422
00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:09.761
All right, here's a few.

423
00:31:09.803 --> 00:31:11.387
Excellent.

424
00:31:11.429 --> 00:31:13.431
Let me know if you
need anything else, okay?


425
00:31:13.473 --> 00:31:14.933
Thank you.

426
00:31:14.975 --> 00:31:16.893
Let's try this one,
it's so pretty!


427
00:31:18.311 --> 00:31:20.188
How does this feel?
Let's have a look.


428
00:31:20.229 --> 00:31:21.481
Um...

429
00:31:21.523 --> 00:31:23.775
It's a little tight.

430
00:31:23.817 --> 00:31:25.443
It's so lovely, though!

431
00:31:25.485 --> 00:31:26.569
Here, let me adjust it.

432
00:31:26.611 --> 00:31:27.904
That's good.

433
00:31:27.946 --> 00:31:30.239
It's so pretty!

434
00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:33.660
Oh, that's so nice.

435
00:31:33.702 --> 00:31:34.870
Better.

436
00:31:34.911 --> 00:31:36.329
Yay!

437
00:31:36.371 --> 00:31:37.706
Okay, let's try one more.

438
00:31:37.747 --> 00:31:39.708
- Okay.
- Here, let's try this one.


439
00:31:42.293 --> 00:31:44.295
Okay, so this...

440
00:31:44.337 --> 00:31:46.089
Let me get it for you?

441
00:31:47.423 --> 00:31:50.135
There you go.
This one is a front closure.


442
00:31:51.594 --> 00:31:53.096
Let me help you.

443
00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:57.893
I remember when mine
used to look like this.


444
00:31:59.519 --> 00:32:01.980
I never understood why
anyone wanted to go bigger.


445
00:32:02.022 --> 00:32:04.066
I can barely
keep these in order.


446
00:32:05.358 --> 00:32:07.276
I agree, totally, yes.

447
00:32:08.695 --> 00:32:10.697
There. Wow!

448
00:32:13.033 --> 00:32:14.367
Turn around.

449
00:32:15.368 --> 00:32:16.870
Have you ever heard the phrase,

450
00:32:16.912 --> 00:32:19.748
"Youth is wasted on the young"?

451
00:32:19.789 --> 00:32:22.000
That's how I feel about me.
I wish...


452
00:32:22.042 --> 00:32:24.460
that when I was young,
I had spent more time


453
00:32:24.502 --> 00:32:26.379
just feeling good about my body

454
00:32:26.421 --> 00:32:29.758
rather than worrying about all
of my perceived shortcomings.


455
00:32:31.218 --> 00:32:32.594
This looks lovely.

456
00:32:35.931 --> 00:32:37.933
In case you wanted to remember.

457
00:32:40.810 --> 00:32:42.145
Um, yes?

458
00:32:42.187 --> 00:32:43.563
How we doing in there, ladies?

459
00:32:43.605 --> 00:32:45.899
Great. Some of these
are gonna work.


460
00:32:45.941 --> 00:32:47.734
Great, good to hear.

461
00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:50.946
All right!

462
00:32:51.905 --> 00:32:53.531
Also, I have all these clothes

463
00:32:53.573 --> 00:32:55.158
that I don't really
wear anymore.


464
00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:56.534
So, why don't you try 'em on,

465
00:32:56.576 --> 00:32:57.702
see if anything fits.

466
00:32:57.744 --> 00:32:59.412
- Okay.
- Okay!


467
00:33:05.418 --> 00:33:07.503
- Honey?
- Hmm?


468
00:33:07.545 --> 00:33:10.298
What do you think about
women who get plastic surgery?


469
00:33:11.299 --> 00:33:12.759
What do you mean, fake boobs?

470
00:33:12.801 --> 00:33:15.386
- I mean...
- Mm, maybe something else.


471
00:33:17.055 --> 00:33:19.182
Like a fake butt?

472
00:33:19.224 --> 00:33:21.684
- I love your ass.
- You sure?


473
00:33:21.726 --> 00:33:24.604
- Yeah.
- I don't know, though.


474
00:33:24.646 --> 00:33:26.773
I mean, maybe I
ought to consider it.


475
00:33:28.566 --> 00:33:32.070
You know, it's not like I'm..

476
00:33:32.112 --> 00:33:34.030
Thirty-five anymore.

477
00:33:35.448 --> 00:33:37.867
Maybe, just,

478
00:33:37.909 --> 00:33:40.453
you know, like, a little nip,

479
00:33:40.495 --> 00:33:42.413
a little tuck, like a little...

480
00:33:42.455 --> 00:33:44.624
something.
What do you think?


481
00:33:48.003 --> 00:33:49.796
You know what
really gets me off?


482
00:33:50.964 --> 00:33:52.632
What I find most exciting?

483
00:33:54.092 --> 00:33:55.343
Your brilliance.

484
00:33:57.137 --> 00:33:58.763
You're not only
hot and perfect,


485
00:33:58.805 --> 00:34:00.974
you're the most amazing mother
to our children,


486
00:34:01.016 --> 00:34:04.477
and you have the most
creative and intuitive mind


487
00:34:04.519 --> 00:34:06.313
that I've ever interacted with.

488
00:34:06.354 --> 00:34:08.439
I have the pleasure of
living with that mind


489
00:34:08.481 --> 00:34:09.607
every day of my life.

490
00:34:10.984 --> 00:34:13.195
Mmm, really?

491
00:34:13.236 --> 00:34:15.571
Yes, really.

492
00:34:21.161 --> 00:34:22.537
Sorry!

493
00:34:22.578 --> 00:34:24.039
I don't mean to interrupt.

494
00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:26.249
I just wanted to
let you know, Mary,


495
00:34:26.291 --> 00:34:28.501
that I'm gonna be in
a little late tomorrow.


496
00:34:28.543 --> 00:34:30.003
I have a doctor's appointment.

497
00:34:30.045 --> 00:34:32.380
- Okay.
- The kids are in bed, asleep.


498
00:34:32.421 --> 00:34:34.132
Thanks, good night.

499
00:34:34.174 --> 00:34:35.884
All right, good night.

500
00:37:32.935 --> 00:37:34.645
Mary, what do you think?

501
00:37:34.687 --> 00:37:36.481
I'm sorry, what?

502
00:37:37.773 --> 00:37:40.443
Of the mother being the killer
in the end?


503
00:37:44.113 --> 00:37:48.326
You want our hero to
suddenly become the villain?


504
00:37:48.368 --> 00:37:50.578
That's your idea of a twist?

505
00:37:50.619 --> 00:37:52.705
I mean, it's on point

506
00:37:52.747 --> 00:37:54.790
with where everything's
headed right now.


507
00:37:54.832 --> 00:37:56.125
On trend, don't you think?

508
00:37:56.167 --> 00:37:58.253
Yes! Take this woman,

509
00:37:58.294 --> 00:38:00.213
who we made into a hero and...

510
00:38:00.255 --> 00:38:02.715
Flip it. Make her
the anti-hero.


511
00:38:02.757 --> 00:38:05.343
That's not actually
the way it works.


512
00:38:05.385 --> 00:38:07.095
I like it.

513
00:38:07.136 --> 00:38:09.013
Just a thought.

514
00:38:09.055 --> 00:38:10.557
You're the professional.

515
00:38:10.598 --> 00:38:13.268
We trust you. You'll
come up with something.


516
00:38:13.309 --> 00:38:14.769
Always do.

517
00:38:14.810 --> 00:38:16.187
Are there any other notes

518
00:38:16.229 --> 00:38:18.064
we want to give Mary
while we're here?


519
00:38:18.106 --> 00:38:20.275
I love how you
paint your characters,


520
00:38:20.316 --> 00:38:21.984
your descriptions, the world.

521
00:38:22.026 --> 00:38:24.028
You're excellent at this, Mary.

522
00:38:24.070 --> 00:38:26.281
Just think there's
a real opportunity here


523
00:38:26.322 --> 00:38:28.783
for you to explore
her darker side.


524
00:38:28.824 --> 00:38:31.744
She's longing for
something more.


525
00:38:31.786 --> 00:38:35.582
Your words are so vivid
on the page...


526
00:38:58.687 --> 00:39:02.275
...think if you could somehow
weave this into her back story,


527
00:39:02.317 --> 00:39:04.986
then you would have
something truly special.


528
00:39:06.654 --> 00:39:07.863
Okay.

529
00:39:08.990 --> 00:39:10.199
All right.

530
00:39:14.912 --> 00:39:17.457
Have you ever been
attracted to a woman before?


531
00:39:20.709 --> 00:39:22.211
Are you sure? Think about it.

532
00:39:22.253 --> 00:39:23.712
No.

533
00:39:23.754 --> 00:39:26.466
It could all be in your head.

534
00:39:26.508 --> 00:39:28.635
A subconscious fantasy.

535
00:39:28.676 --> 00:39:30.553
It's like, one minute

536
00:39:30.595 --> 00:39:33.222
she's like this innocent
young child, you know?


537
00:39:33.264 --> 00:39:37.352
Then the next minute, it's like
she's this master seductress


538
00:39:37.393 --> 00:39:40.021
and I'm just her lap dog
waiting for the next treat.


539
00:39:40.062 --> 00:39:43.525
Honestly, you're
probably just sex starved.


540
00:39:43.566 --> 00:39:46.902
No, no.
Tom is amazing!


541
00:39:46.944 --> 00:39:48.904
No complaints there.

542
00:39:51.324 --> 00:39:55.953
I mean, in this strange,
sexual servant type of way,


543
00:39:55.995 --> 00:39:59.207
I feel like she would do
whatever I asked her to do.


544
00:39:59.248 --> 00:40:00.958
To me.

545
00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:03.545
That's bad of me
to think like that, isn't it?


546
00:40:03.586 --> 00:40:07.215
Careful, love,
maybe this is her plan.


547
00:40:07.256 --> 00:40:08.966
Get you hooked on her so that

548
00:40:09.008 --> 00:40:12.261
she can overthrow your kingdom
and take everything in it.


549
00:40:13.555 --> 00:40:14.763
Really?

550
00:40:14.805 --> 00:40:16.349
No, I'm just kidding.

551
00:40:16.391 --> 00:40:19.101
I told you, strange things
happen when I write.


552
00:40:19.143 --> 00:40:20.603
I'll say.

553
00:40:20.645 --> 00:40:22.855
Make her your muse, then.

554
00:40:22.897 --> 00:40:25.149
Use her and this thing
and write about it.


555
00:40:25.191 --> 00:40:27.276
You said you're having
writer's block, right?


556
00:40:27.318 --> 00:40:29.111
- Yeah.
- You're already paying for her.


557
00:40:29.153 --> 00:40:31.822
Get the most
bang for your buck.


558
00:40:37.912 --> 00:40:39.747
Whoa. That is a crazy story.

559
00:40:39.788 --> 00:40:41.624
You must have been
some tough kid.


560
00:40:41.666 --> 00:40:43.959
Yep, my grandpa always said

561
00:40:44.001 --> 00:40:45.836
I was the grandson
he always wanted,


562
00:40:45.878 --> 00:40:47.880
and finally got.

563
00:40:48.923 --> 00:40:51.509
Oh, hey, hon.

564
00:40:51.551 --> 00:40:52.885
Hi.

565
00:40:52.927 --> 00:40:54.220
Come on!

566
00:40:54.262 --> 00:40:55.971
Okay, look at me.

567
00:40:56.013 --> 00:40:57.848
How was your workout?

568
00:40:57.890 --> 00:41:00.560
Good! I'm sore.

569
00:41:04.063 --> 00:41:05.648
Mommy!

570
00:41:05.690 --> 00:41:06.982
I got it.

571
00:41:07.983 --> 00:41:09.777
Hey. Hey-hey-hey-hey.

572
00:41:09.818 --> 00:41:11.362
What's going on?

573
00:41:15.199 --> 00:41:18.536
What, did your instructor
make you horny again?


574
00:41:18.578 --> 00:41:21.914
God, no!

575
00:41:21.956 --> 00:41:24.125
But I do think we
should go out tonight.


576
00:41:24.166 --> 00:41:25.418
Oh, yeah,

577
00:41:25.460 --> 00:41:26.794
we have that
fundraising dinner.


578
00:41:26.835 --> 00:41:28.879
- That's tonight?
- Yeah.


579
00:41:28.921 --> 00:41:30.298
I totally forgot.

580
00:41:30.339 --> 00:41:31.799
I didn't even book a sitter.

581
00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:33.801
I'm not doing anything tonight.

582
00:41:33.842 --> 00:41:36.262
Um, if you need me
to stay late, I can.


583
00:41:51.486 --> 00:41:52.779
Oh, Grace.

584
00:41:56.240 --> 00:41:58.033
- Can you help me?
- Yeah.


585
00:42:01.287 --> 00:42:03.456
- All right.
- Stunning.


586
00:42:03.498 --> 00:42:05.166
- Thank you, really? Great.
- Mm-hmm.


587
00:42:05.207 --> 00:42:07.084
We better leave now

588
00:42:07.126 --> 00:42:08.877
- if we're not gonna be late.
- Okay, I'm coming.


589
00:42:08.919 --> 00:42:10.421
What is it?

590
00:42:11.547 --> 00:42:13.882
I just wanted to say
thank you.


591
00:42:13.924 --> 00:42:15.843
I mean, this job,

592
00:42:15.884 --> 00:42:18.638
you, Tom, the kids, it...

593
00:42:19.847 --> 00:42:21.516
It means the world to me, Mary.

594
00:42:27.021 --> 00:42:28.773
Listen, Grace.

595
00:42:28.815 --> 00:42:30.775
You...

596
00:42:30.817 --> 00:42:32.943
are a very special young lady

597
00:42:32.985 --> 00:42:35.154
and we are lucky to have you.

598
00:42:35.196 --> 00:42:36.447
Are we going?

599
00:42:36.489 --> 00:42:38.282
Yeah, yeah, of course we are.

600
00:42:38.324 --> 00:42:40.493
All right, we'll be back
before midnight, okay?


601
00:42:40.535 --> 00:42:41.703
- No problem.
- All right.


602
00:42:41.744 --> 00:42:42.995
- Have fun.
- Thanks, Grace.


603
00:42:43.037 --> 00:42:44.246
Good night, Grace.

604
00:42:53.756 --> 00:42:55.717
She said she was
one of eight children.


605
00:42:55.758 --> 00:42:57.968
Mm-hm. I knew she
was home-schooled.


606
00:42:59.303 --> 00:43:00.638
So I...

607
00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:02.473
don't really
know her whole story,


608
00:43:02.515 --> 00:43:04.350
but from what I gather,

609
00:43:04.392 --> 00:43:07.395
we're the only people she has.

610
00:43:07.436 --> 00:43:09.313
Do you think...

611
00:43:09.355 --> 00:43:11.691
we should make her
more a part of the family?


612
00:43:29.208 --> 00:43:30.877
Shh.

613
00:44:02.575 --> 00:44:05.202
- Oh, there they are!
- Hi!


614
00:44:05.244 --> 00:44:07.705
Hello, thank you for coming.

615
00:44:07.747 --> 00:44:10.875
- So nice to see you.
- Great to see you!


616
00:44:10.917 --> 00:44:12.126
Thank you!

617
00:44:12.167 --> 00:44:13.586
And here she is!

618
00:44:13.628 --> 00:44:16.881
The boss lady,
who is looking amazing!


619
00:44:16.923 --> 00:44:19.007
- The boss lady, mmm!
- Thank you.


620
00:44:19.049 --> 00:44:20.718
Look at those earrings,
I love them!


621
00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:23.471
- Thank you, thank you, baby.
- Oh!


622
00:44:24.639 --> 00:44:26.557
Every seat filled.

623
00:44:26.599 --> 00:44:28.726
Tonight alone
will raise more money


624
00:44:28.768 --> 00:44:30.686
than all the other
fundraisers combined.


625
00:44:30.728 --> 00:44:32.396
- Amazing!
- Cheers!


626
00:44:32.438 --> 00:44:34.982
- Congratulations!
- How's the writing going, Mary?


627
00:44:35.023 --> 00:44:36.317
I hear you're in the midst

628
00:44:36.358 --> 00:44:38.444
of adding another book
to the series?


629
00:44:38.486 --> 00:44:41.656
All I can say is... finally.

630
00:44:41.697 --> 00:44:44.575
Okay, Rick, leave her alone,

631
00:44:44.617 --> 00:44:46.619
she doesn't want to
talk about that tonight.


632
00:44:46.661 --> 00:44:48.203
That's true.

633
00:44:48.245 --> 00:44:50.205
Live music is a rarity.

634
00:44:50.247 --> 00:44:52.792
That must be you.

635
00:44:55.085 --> 00:44:57.045
- All right.
- All right.


636
00:44:57.087 --> 00:44:58.714
So...

637
00:44:59.715 --> 00:45:01.926
to answer your question, yes.

638
00:45:01.968 --> 00:45:04.052
I am going to write
another book


639
00:45:04.094 --> 00:45:05.513
to add to my series,

640
00:45:05.554 --> 00:45:07.306
but there's just one problem...

641
00:45:08.641 --> 00:45:11.602
I really don't
want to write it.


642
00:45:11.644 --> 00:45:13.688
Well, book four
has to be my favorite.


643
00:45:13.729 --> 00:45:15.898
Yeah, you and everybody else,

644
00:45:15.940 --> 00:45:17.692
but can I tell you something?

645
00:45:17.733 --> 00:45:21.027
I wrote that book at one of
the darkest times of my life.


646
00:45:21.069 --> 00:45:23.823
And so now, you know, it's...

647
00:45:23.865 --> 00:45:25.783
not that easy.

648
00:45:25.825 --> 00:45:28.118
I love all the twists
and turns.


649
00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:31.121
Couldn't figure out who the
killer was until the very end.


650
00:45:37.003 --> 00:45:39.171
If you don't mind
me saying, Mary,


651
00:45:39.213 --> 00:45:41.173
lean into the dark.

652
00:45:41.215 --> 00:45:43.634
That's where
your best stuff is.


653
00:45:48.054 --> 00:45:49.557
Shall we?

654
00:45:50.892 --> 00:45:52.393
Okay.

655
00:46:27.929 --> 00:46:30.598
Oh, Grace, you
didn't have to do that.


656
00:46:30.639 --> 00:46:32.307
Could you do
something else for me?


657
00:46:32.349 --> 00:46:34.060
Could you put this on my back?

658
00:46:34.100 --> 00:46:35.978
- Yeah.
- Thank you.


659
00:46:52.244 --> 00:46:53.537
That feels good.

660
00:47:25.069 --> 00:47:28.280
Whoo!

661
00:47:28.322 --> 00:47:30.532
Oops!

662
00:47:31.742 --> 00:47:34.078
Ooh, it feels so good!

663
00:47:44.338 --> 00:47:45.840
Go ahead.

664
00:47:45.881 --> 00:47:48.009
Don't worry, no one
can see you out here.


665
00:48:14.827 --> 00:48:17.203
Wow, goddess!

666
00:48:18.622 --> 00:48:19.623
Really?

667
00:48:19.665 --> 00:48:21.167
Yes!

668
00:48:21.207 --> 00:48:22.877
Yay!

669
00:48:25.754 --> 00:48:27.464
Whoo-hoo!

670
00:48:27.506 --> 00:48:29.299
Doesn't that feel good?

671
00:48:45.399 --> 00:48:47.068
So, I'm out of the woods.

672
00:48:47.109 --> 00:48:48.527
Broke the story.

673
00:48:48.569 --> 00:48:50.654
That's amazing.

674
00:48:52.531 --> 00:48:54.366
We should celebrate, right?

675
00:48:56.952 --> 00:48:58.328
Not yet.

676
00:49:00.873 --> 00:49:03.084
Well, maybe. Just a little.

677
00:49:04.292 --> 00:49:06.962
Both of us.

678
00:49:21.685 --> 00:49:24.021
I used to be obsessed
with this song.


679
00:49:25.564 --> 00:49:28.400
Do you want a whiskey and soda?

680
00:49:28.442 --> 00:49:30.485
Wait, wait. Are you old enough?

681
00:49:30.527 --> 00:49:31.862
Yeah.

682
00:49:31.904 --> 00:49:33.239
Okay.

683
00:49:39.787 --> 00:49:41.163
Here you go.

684
00:51:07.124 --> 00:51:10.460
I've never felt more loved,

685
00:51:10.502 --> 00:51:12.629
more at home,

686
00:51:12.671 --> 00:51:15.465
more a part of anything than...

687
00:51:15.507 --> 00:51:17.634
when I'm here with you.

688
00:51:19.511 --> 00:51:21.347
Please don't ever let me go.

689
00:51:21.387 --> 00:51:25.059
Oh, no,
of course we would never!


690
00:51:25.100 --> 00:51:29.188
We'll be here for you forever,
Grace, we love you.


691
00:51:29.230 --> 00:51:31.773
You're very special to us.

692
00:51:35.527 --> 00:51:37.612
Did you know
that you're the reason


693
00:51:37.654 --> 00:51:39.281
that I broke my writer's block?

694
00:51:39.323 --> 00:51:41.533
- Really?
- Yeah.


695
00:51:42.784 --> 00:51:44.203
Yeah.

696
00:53:22.508 --> 00:53:23.969
Bravo.

697
00:53:24.011 --> 00:53:25.720
- Hey!
- Way to go, you guys!


698
00:53:25.762 --> 00:53:27.139
You did so great!

699
00:53:27.181 --> 00:53:29.891
One, two, three.

700
00:53:29.933 --> 00:53:31.601
- Oh, it looks so good.
- So nice.


701
00:53:31.643 --> 00:53:32.853
Good job, you guys.

702
00:53:32.894 --> 00:53:34.520
Now, Grace, take one with us.

703
00:53:34.562 --> 00:53:36.440
- No, that's okay.
- Please, Grace!


704
00:53:36.482 --> 00:53:38.524
- It's a family thing.
- Come on, hop in.


705
00:53:38.566 --> 00:53:40.694
- Okay.
- Yay!


706
00:53:42.612 --> 00:53:43.989
Ready?

707
00:53:44.031 --> 00:53:45.573
Here we go, everybody smile.

708
00:53:45.615 --> 00:53:47.784
Very good, one more.

709
00:53:47.826 --> 00:53:49.535
- Wonderful.
- You guys,


710
00:53:49.577 --> 00:53:51.663
go get a cookie, okay?
You deserve it.


711
00:53:51.705 --> 00:53:52.998
- Yes, thank you!
- All right.


712
00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:54.208
Um...

713
00:53:54.249 --> 00:53:55.625
I'd say they did pretty good.

714
00:53:58.753 --> 00:54:01.923
Grace, could you just
come talk to me for a second?


715
00:54:01.965 --> 00:54:03.175
Sure.

716
00:54:11.141 --> 00:54:13.643
- I just...
- Did I do something wrong?


717
00:54:13.685 --> 00:54:16.646
No! No, no, nothing like that.

718
00:54:16.688 --> 00:54:18.190
I
-I... I just...

719
00:54:20.692 --> 00:54:23.695
What happened the other day...

720
00:54:23.737 --> 00:54:25.822
can never happen again, and...

721
00:54:25.864 --> 00:54:28.325
I don't think that we should
even talk about it.


722
00:54:28.367 --> 00:54:30.160
What happened?

723
00:54:30.202 --> 00:54:32.496
I have no idea
what you're talking about.


724
00:54:33.830 --> 00:54:36.833
Okay, okay, good. Good.

725
00:54:38.668 --> 00:54:40.462
All right, let's go back.

726
00:55:24.923 --> 00:55:27.759
I've been
waiting for this moment.


727
00:55:31.597 --> 00:55:32.931
May I?

728
00:56:20.187 --> 00:56:21.980
Open your mouth.

729
00:56:54.346 --> 00:56:56.640
No, Grace, no.

730
00:56:56.682 --> 00:56:58.892
Let me make you happy.

731
00:57:00.143 --> 00:57:03.771
All I want to do
is make you happy.


732
00:58:32.986 --> 00:58:34.696
Oh, thanks, babe.

733
00:58:40.868 --> 00:58:42.412
You're so hot.

734
00:58:42.454 --> 00:58:44.414
Baby, I can't.

735
00:58:44.456 --> 00:58:45.915
I can't, I'm writing.

736
00:58:46.874 --> 00:58:48.502
- Okay.
- Mmm.


737
00:59:24.705 --> 00:59:26.790
You are not allowed
to disturb her, Sam.


738
00:59:26.832 --> 00:59:28.375
Ouch, that hurt.

739
00:59:28.416 --> 00:59:30.335
- Grace is right.
- But Dad...


740
00:59:30.377 --> 00:59:32.295
I know you miss her,
but listen, bud,


741
00:59:32.337 --> 00:59:34.840
we're gonna support your mom
by letting her work, okay?


742
00:59:34.881 --> 00:59:37.217
And when she's done,
you can bug her all you want.


743
00:59:37.258 --> 00:59:39.386
- Okay.
- All right, go get in the car.


744
00:59:39.427 --> 00:59:41.888
Oh, have we made you late?

745
00:59:41.929 --> 00:59:44.182
Uh, no, I was gonna
take the day off, anyway.


746
00:59:44.224 --> 00:59:45.809
In fact,
after we drop the kids,


747
00:59:45.851 --> 00:59:47.644
how 'bout we
stop for a bite to eat?


748
00:59:47.686 --> 00:59:49.855
Um, I would, but I...

749
00:59:49.896 --> 00:59:51.439
Grace, I think you need a break

750
00:59:51.481 --> 00:59:52.982
and I could use the company.

751
00:59:54.025 --> 00:59:55.777
- Uh, okay.
- All right.


752
01:00:48.121 --> 01:00:50.248
Hi, what can I
get started for you?


753
01:00:50.290 --> 01:00:53.000
I'll have a slice of quiche

754
01:00:53.042 --> 01:00:54.502
and a Bloody Mary.

755
01:00:54.544 --> 01:00:55.921
Okay, and for you?

756
01:00:55.962 --> 01:00:58.590
Um, yeah. I'll have the same.

757
01:00:58.632 --> 01:01:00.300
- All right, sounds good.
- Thanks.


758
01:01:04.262 --> 01:01:06.347
I've never seen
this side of you before.


759
01:01:06.389 --> 01:01:08.182
What do you mean?

760
01:01:10.101 --> 01:01:11.603
Something about you is...

761
01:01:11.645 --> 01:01:14.856
different. I'm not sure what,
but I like it.


762
01:01:20.654 --> 01:01:22.906
All right.

763
01:01:24.157 --> 01:01:25.909
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.


764
01:01:27.243 --> 01:01:29.329
Apparently we should
let you out more often.


765
01:01:29.370 --> 01:01:32.039
Give you a break
from the little monsters.


766
01:01:33.458 --> 01:01:35.293
They're good kids.

767
01:01:35.335 --> 01:01:36.837
Oh, yeah, they are.

768
01:01:36.878 --> 01:01:38.755
So are you.

769
01:01:40.131 --> 01:01:42.383
Hey, I'm no kid.

770
01:01:44.928 --> 01:01:47.054
Here you guys are.

771
01:01:51.392 --> 01:01:53.144
So, how old are you, anyway?

772
01:01:55.229 --> 01:01:56.731
How old do you think I am?

773
01:01:58.984 --> 01:02:01.611
Well, two weeks ago
I would have said twenty.


774
01:02:01.653 --> 01:02:04.113
Today, maybe more like forty.

775
01:02:20.005 --> 01:02:21.422
What?

776
01:02:39.399 --> 01:02:42.068
["Fall" by Donora playing"

777
01:02:58.251 --> 01:03:00.461
Whoo-hoo!

778
01:03:37.624 --> 01:03:39.500
I hope you like
sprouts on your sandwich.


779
01:03:39.542 --> 01:03:42.462
Sure! Now, I haven't done this
in a long time, okay?


780
01:03:42.503 --> 01:03:43.964
It's easy.

781
01:03:44.005 --> 01:03:45.924
Here we go!

782
01:03:47.133 --> 01:03:48.843
Yippee!

783
01:04:15.620 --> 01:04:17.789
Is there anything

784
01:04:17.831 --> 01:04:20.249
Nothing!

785
01:04:35.264 --> 01:04:36.641
So, what do you think?

786
01:04:36.683 --> 01:04:38.852
It's perfect.

787
01:04:54.408 --> 01:04:56.619
I always want to
get to the other side,


788
01:04:56.661 --> 01:04:58.705
but I never know
how I'm gonna do it.


789
01:05:03.918 --> 01:05:06.253
To an incredible woman

790
01:05:06.295 --> 01:05:08.255
and a brilliant writer,

791
01:05:08.297 --> 01:05:09.716
on her first draft.

792
01:05:09.757 --> 01:05:11.425
Thank you, sweetheart.

793
01:05:11.467 --> 01:05:14.762
I could never have gotten
this far without you, truly.


794
01:05:14.804 --> 01:05:18.516
You are the best partner
a girl could ever have.


795
01:05:24.147 --> 01:05:26.024
Oh, I brought this poem.

796
01:05:26.066 --> 01:05:28.359
I first read it
when I was in college,


797
01:05:28.401 --> 01:05:30.570
I thought
you might like it.


798
01:05:32.279 --> 01:05:34.281
In the summer and in the winter

799
01:05:34.323 --> 01:05:38.619
I shall walk up and down
the patterned garden paths


800
01:05:38.661 --> 01:05:41.164
in my stiff brocaded gown

801
01:05:41.206 --> 01:05:43.208
The squills and daffodils...

802
01:06:03.019 --> 01:06:06.355
And the softness of my body
will be guarded from embrace


803
01:06:06.397 --> 01:06:09.525
By each button, hook, and lace

804
01:06:39.597 --> 01:06:42.767
I see so much of myself
when I look at you.


805
01:07:02.829 --> 01:07:04.289
Grace, I...

806
01:07:04.330 --> 01:07:06.082
I think we should stop.

807
01:07:07.083 --> 01:07:08.835
- Did I...
- No, no, no.


808
01:07:08.876 --> 01:07:10.920
You're perfect.

809
01:07:10.962 --> 01:07:15.175
You're so, so perfect.

810
01:07:29.522 --> 01:07:31.482
Who would do such a thing?

811
01:07:32.733 --> 01:07:34.568
I've gotta call Tom.

812
01:07:38.948 --> 01:07:40.783
...what I think.

813
01:07:40.825 --> 01:07:43.119
If it matches
with what I think...


814
01:07:43.161 --> 01:07:46.122
Hey, I've been trying to call
you, where've you been?


815
01:07:46.164 --> 01:07:48.749
Oh, I guess I left my phone
inside. So, sorry.


816
01:07:48.791 --> 01:07:50.501
Where'd you guys go?

817
01:07:50.543 --> 01:07:52.545
- We...
- Well, we thought about...


818
01:07:54.172 --> 01:07:55.923
We went to this place
by the river,


819
01:07:55.965 --> 01:07:57.717
it was extraordinary.

820
01:07:57.758 --> 01:08:00.053
You remember that wooded area
that we found a while back?


821
01:08:00.094 --> 01:08:02.096
Where you took me
a few years ago?


822
01:08:02.138 --> 01:08:04.265
Mm-hmm! Finally
got some time to explore.


823
01:08:04.307 --> 01:08:07.060
Well, maybe you'll
take me there sometime.


824
01:08:08.853 --> 01:08:10.104
Let me see this.

825
01:08:11.689 --> 01:08:13.066
What's going on?

826
01:08:13.107 --> 01:08:14.942
It's probably nothing, but...

827
01:08:16.236 --> 01:08:18.487
What?

828
01:08:18.529 --> 01:08:21.157
When was the last time
you were intimate with Tom?


829
01:08:21.199 --> 01:08:23.284
I don't know, like, uh...

830
01:08:23.326 --> 01:08:25.745
I guess before
I started writing.


831
01:08:27.288 --> 01:08:28.581
You know what they say,

832
01:08:28.622 --> 01:08:30.083
if he's not
getting it from you,


833
01:08:30.124 --> 01:08:32.335
where is he getting it from?

834
01:08:32.377 --> 01:08:34.587
Oh, come on!

835
01:08:34.628 --> 01:08:37.798
You're actually...
You're saying you think Tom...?


836
01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:39.967
I mean, seriously.

837
01:08:40.009 --> 01:08:42.553
First, you're just
criticizing Grace.


838
01:08:42.595 --> 01:08:45.306
Now, you're all
paranoid about Tom.


839
01:08:45.348 --> 01:08:47.516
I mean, why don't
you tell me what's going on.


840
01:08:47.558 --> 01:08:49.727
- What?!
- I mean, seriously.


841
01:08:49.769 --> 01:08:51.271
First there's the fundraiser,

842
01:08:51.312 --> 01:08:53.147
I saw the way
you were looking at him.


843
01:08:53.189 --> 01:08:54.315
Stop it.

844
01:08:54.357 --> 01:08:55.649
What are you doing here now?

845
01:08:55.691 --> 01:08:57.277
What were you guys
talking about?


846
01:08:57.318 --> 01:08:58.945
I was here to talk about you.

847
01:08:58.986 --> 01:09:01.572
Me? What about me?

848
01:09:04.951 --> 01:09:08.037
Let's talk when we can get
a little bit more privacy.


849
01:09:08.079 --> 01:09:10.081
But just know that
I love you


850
01:09:10.123 --> 01:09:11.916
and I only want
what's best for you.


851
01:09:11.958 --> 01:09:13.584
You have to know that.

852
01:09:28.224 --> 01:09:29.600
Something smells good.

853
01:09:29.642 --> 01:09:31.852
One of my family's
secret recipes.


854
01:09:31.894 --> 01:09:34.147
Something my aunt
used to make.


855
01:09:37.024 --> 01:09:38.443
Tom and the kids are...?

856
01:09:38.484 --> 01:09:40.486
On a walk, I think.

857
01:09:43.323 --> 01:09:45.032
Oh, babe! Oh, no.

858
01:09:45.074 --> 01:09:46.951
Let me help you.

859
01:09:46.993 --> 01:09:48.911
Put it down.

860
01:09:48.953 --> 01:09:50.830
Let's be very careful.

861
01:09:50.871 --> 01:09:52.915
Look. Ta-da!

862
01:09:58.963 --> 01:10:00.798
No more E.R. visits.

863
01:10:02.258 --> 01:10:03.509
Let me get you some chili.

864
01:10:03.550 --> 01:10:04.844
Okay.

865
01:10:14.145 --> 01:10:15.980
Do you know
how beautiful you are?


866
01:10:19.442 --> 01:10:21.027
Did you know that

867
01:10:21.068 --> 01:10:24.613
tomorrow is
my and Tom's anniversary?


868
01:10:24.655 --> 01:10:26.991
I hope when I'm older
I look as good as you.


869
01:10:27.033 --> 01:10:29.827
Ten years!

870
01:10:29.869 --> 01:10:31.871
Did you hear me, Mary?

871
01:10:33.789 --> 01:10:35.082
I bought a new dress,

872
01:10:35.124 --> 01:10:36.876
it's black and it's backless.

873
01:10:36.917 --> 01:10:38.002
I hope he likes it.

874
01:10:38.044 --> 01:10:39.295
Mary.

875
01:10:39.337 --> 01:10:40.921
Please.

876
01:10:42.006 --> 01:10:43.632
You deserve this.

877
01:11:09.450 --> 01:11:11.035
Mom?

878
01:11:13.787 --> 01:11:15.998
Hey, it smells great!
What's cooking?


879
01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:18.625
- Yeah, I'm starving.
- Me, too.


880
01:11:18.667 --> 01:11:22.880
I... I'm just suddenly
not feeling so great, baby.


881
01:11:22.922 --> 01:11:25.049
I think I'm just gonna
go lay down, okay?


882
01:11:25.091 --> 01:11:26.467
I'll get you some water.

883
01:11:26.509 --> 01:11:28.344
Thanks, honey.

884
01:11:28.386 --> 01:11:30.763
Hey, guys, how was the park?

885
01:11:37.437 --> 01:11:38.854
Here you go.

886
01:11:38.896 --> 01:11:40.231
I love you, babe.

887
01:11:40.273 --> 01:11:42.691
Mm, love you more.

888
01:11:49.449 --> 01:11:50.783
Tom.

889
01:12:18.561 --> 01:12:20.813
Not that hard, you idiot!

890
01:12:50.301 --> 01:12:51.844
Slower!

891
01:12:56.599 --> 01:12:58.100
There.

892
01:12:58.142 --> 01:12:59.644
Oh, that's it.

893
01:13:06.066 --> 01:13:07.276
Now!

894
01:13:17.995 --> 01:13:20.789
Oh, that's a good boy.

895
01:13:29.340 --> 01:13:30.841
Who's in charge?

896
01:13:32.301 --> 01:13:35.179
I said, who's in charge

897
01:13:35.221 --> 01:13:38.057
and will always be in charge?!

898
01:13:47.316 --> 01:13:48.984
Don't worry,

899
01:13:49.026 --> 01:13:50.903
she won't remember any of this.

900
01:14:20.933 --> 01:14:22.351
You feeling better?

901
01:14:22.393 --> 01:14:24.270
Yeah, sort of, yeah.

902
01:14:24.311 --> 01:14:26.522
Just had a horrible dream.

903
01:14:28.482 --> 01:14:30.610
Sam, Alex, time for dinner.

904
01:14:33.779 --> 01:14:35.822
Come on, take your seat.

905
01:14:35.864 --> 01:14:37.408
No more video games.

906
01:14:40.994 --> 01:14:43.247
Well, as long as you
survived your dream,


907
01:14:43.289 --> 01:14:44.582
that's all that matters.

908
01:14:48.210 --> 01:14:51.464
Um, Grace, uh...

909
01:14:53.006 --> 01:14:55.551
I seem to remember
you saying that


910
01:14:55.593 --> 01:14:57.970
this was sacred family time.

911
01:14:58.011 --> 01:14:59.388
So...

912
01:14:59.430 --> 01:15:01.890
what the hell are you
still doing here?


913
01:15:01.932 --> 01:15:04.351
What are you saying?
What are you talking about?


914
01:15:04.393 --> 01:15:05.811
Um, she's right.

915
01:15:07.396 --> 01:15:09.189
Must have been
a pretty awful dream.


916
01:15:09.231 --> 01:15:11.609
Teacher says a bad dream
is actually a nightmare.


917
01:15:11.651 --> 01:15:13.860
You and my husband

918
01:15:13.902 --> 01:15:15.446
- were fucking!
- Mary!


919
01:15:15.488 --> 01:15:17.364
Over there, on the counter!

920
01:15:17.406 --> 01:15:19.032
- Damn it!
- It was so real!


921
01:15:19.074 --> 01:15:20.660
It was so real!

922
01:15:20.701 --> 01:15:22.828
And you were like
a totally different person,


923
01:15:22.869 --> 01:15:24.204
you were like somebody else.

924
01:15:24.246 --> 01:15:26.499
Daddy, Mommy's scaring me.

925
01:15:26.540 --> 01:15:28.000
I know honey,

926
01:15:28.041 --> 01:15:29.460
Mommy's not feeling very well.

927
01:15:29.502 --> 01:15:31.337
I think you need to
go back and rest.


928
01:15:31.378 --> 01:15:33.547
You guys, I'm sorry.

929
01:15:33.589 --> 01:15:36.049
I'm really sorry.

930
01:15:38.552 --> 01:15:39.970
When Mommy writes,

931
01:15:40.012 --> 01:15:43.474
sometimes the things
in her mind are so vivid


932
01:15:43.516 --> 01:15:46.101
that she can't tell
the difference between


933
01:15:46.143 --> 01:15:49.062
the imaginary and the real.

934
01:15:55.110 --> 01:15:57.070
What happened to you
out there?


935
01:15:57.112 --> 01:15:58.947
I don't know.

936
01:15:58.989 --> 01:16:01.283
I'm not really sure.

937
01:16:08.457 --> 01:16:11.210
Actually...

938
01:16:13.879 --> 01:16:15.631
I do know, actually.

939
01:16:16.674 --> 01:16:18.133
You know that nightmare?

940
01:16:19.926 --> 01:16:22.262
That's really
how I feel about us.


941
01:16:22.304 --> 01:16:23.848
That's how I feel about you,

942
01:16:23.889 --> 01:16:25.766
that's how I feel
about everything.


943
01:16:25.808 --> 01:16:28.811
Because for the longest time,

944
01:16:28.853 --> 01:16:31.772
I've just been
sitting in the backseat


945
01:16:31.814 --> 01:16:33.816
and I've been
letting you drive.


946
01:16:33.858 --> 01:16:35.150
And I've been supporting you

947
01:16:35.192 --> 01:16:37.820
in everything that
you wanted to do.


948
01:16:37.862 --> 01:16:41.824
And I've been taking all of my
energies and all of my talents,


949
01:16:41.866 --> 01:16:43.992
and pouring them into you

950
01:16:44.034 --> 01:16:47.037
and into the kids
and into this life.


951
01:16:47.079 --> 01:16:50.249
Because I wanted to
build something together.


952
01:16:50.290 --> 01:16:52.752
And what do I get for it?!

953
01:16:52.793 --> 01:16:54.961
What do I get for it?!

954
01:16:55.003 --> 01:16:56.797
Fucking screwed!

955
01:16:56.839 --> 01:16:59.007
You betrayed me!

956
01:16:59.049 --> 01:17:00.926
-You crash us into a wall
-Come on, Mary...


957
01:17:00.967 --> 01:17:02.469
-and then, and then
-Mary...


958
01:17:02.511 --> 01:17:05.514
you expect me
to pick up the pieces


959
01:17:05.556 --> 01:17:07.224
and make everything
better again!


960
01:17:07.266 --> 01:17:08.934
- Mary, I'm sorry.
- No!


961
01:17:08.975 --> 01:17:10.728
- Come here.
- No, don't comfort me!


962
01:17:10.770 --> 01:17:12.271
- Come here.
- Don't comfort me!


963
01:17:12.312 --> 01:17:13.773
I'm sorry!

964
01:17:13.814 --> 01:17:15.566
I'm sorry, I fucked up.

965
01:17:15.608 --> 01:17:18.277
But you're my world,
you're everything to me.


966
01:17:18.318 --> 01:17:19.986
You and the twins.

967
01:17:22.907 --> 01:17:25.409
I want to find a way
to make it up to you.


968
01:17:25.451 --> 01:17:27.244
I promise, I will.

969
01:17:27.286 --> 01:17:29.538
And you're right,
we're never gonna


970
01:17:29.580 --> 01:17:32.374
- live like that again.
- No! You're damn straight!


971
01:17:32.416 --> 01:17:33.876
Yeah.

972
01:17:35.085 --> 01:17:36.921
You mean everything to me.

973
01:17:36.962 --> 01:17:39.840
Come on. You're almost through.

974
01:17:39.882 --> 01:17:41.926
Just let's not let this thing

975
01:17:41.967 --> 01:17:44.720
kill us on the way out.

976
01:17:44.762 --> 01:17:47.681
- All right. Yeah.
- Okay?


977
01:20:44.608 --> 01:20:47.736
- Happy anniversary.
- Happy anniversary.


978
01:20:53.241 --> 01:20:55.160
I'm gonna head in early today.

979
01:20:55.201 --> 01:20:57.454
- Rendezvous tonight?
- Yeah.


980
01:21:06.630 --> 01:21:09.424
Oh, hi, this is Mary Morrison.

981
01:21:09.466 --> 01:21:12.678
I'm calling about a check
that I sent in a while ago,


982
01:21:12.719 --> 01:21:14.888
but it seems like it
hasn't been deposited yet.


983
01:21:14.930 --> 01:21:16.598
Oh, hi, Mrs. Morrison,

984
01:21:16.640 --> 01:21:18.058
I've been meaning to call you.

985
01:21:18.100 --> 01:21:20.727
Yes, I have your check
right here.


986
01:21:20.769 --> 01:21:22.562
I was just waiting to hear

987
01:21:22.604 --> 01:21:24.773
which caregiver
you want to go with.


988
01:21:26.025 --> 01:21:27.275
What?

989
01:21:27.317 --> 01:21:29.361
I should have
called you sooner,


990
01:21:29.402 --> 01:21:31.279
I'm sorry,
we've been terribly busy.


991
01:21:32.531 --> 01:21:33.824
Um...

992
01:21:36.743 --> 01:21:38.745
Grace.

993
01:21:38.787 --> 01:21:40.330
You have a Grace, right?

994
01:21:41.748 --> 01:21:44.292
Sorry, we don't have
anybody by that name.


995
01:21:46.294 --> 01:21:47.379
Mary?

996
01:21:47.420 --> 01:21:49.965
Um, okay, thank you.

997
01:21:50.007 --> 01:21:52.342
Thank you so much.
Thank you for letting me know


998
01:21:52.384 --> 01:21:55.679
that it will be deposited soon.
Okay, bye-bye.


999
01:21:57.430 --> 01:21:59.641
I was thinking of changing
the master bedroom sheets.


1000
01:21:59.683 --> 01:22:01.560
Since it's your anniversary.

1001
01:22:04.563 --> 01:22:06.190
Yes, of course.

1002
01:22:06.231 --> 01:22:08.108
Grace, I...

1003
01:22:09.401 --> 01:22:11.695
I just want to apologize
about last night.


1004
01:22:11.737 --> 01:22:15.199
I really don't know
what came over me.


1005
01:22:15.240 --> 01:22:17.242
I think I had a fever.

1006
01:22:17.283 --> 01:22:18.911
I understand.

1007
01:22:18.952 --> 01:22:21.830
Nightmares can feel so real
sometimes.


1008
01:22:31.965 --> 01:22:35.427
If this were a library,
I would check it out.


1009
01:22:35.468 --> 01:22:37.262
Well, if you like that one,

1010
01:22:37.303 --> 01:22:38.889
follow me.

1011
01:22:54.320 --> 01:22:58.075
She's your best friend and you
don't even know her last name?


1012
01:22:58.117 --> 01:23:00.119
I do know a book
she checked out recently


1013
01:23:00.160 --> 01:23:03.122
is Laddie, by
Gene Stratton-Porter.


1014
01:23:11.797 --> 01:23:14.174
The only person
to check out Laddie


1015
01:23:14.216 --> 01:23:16.802
in the last three months.

1016
01:23:16.843 --> 01:23:19.221
Elaine, please,
please call me back,


1017
01:23:19.263 --> 01:23:20.847
I need to talk to you.

1018
01:24:00.762 --> 01:24:02.388
Elaine?

1019
01:24:05.934 --> 01:24:08.645
Oh! Thank God, here you are!

1020
01:24:08.687 --> 01:24:09.938
I've been trying to call you!

1021
01:24:09.980 --> 01:24:11.898
You would not believe...

1022
01:24:23.994 --> 01:24:25.578
Oh, my God!

1023
01:24:33.212 --> 01:24:36.298
Ah! Oh! 911!

1024
01:24:36.340 --> 01:24:38.091
Please hurry!

1025
01:24:38.133 --> 01:24:40.468
Please come! Oh, my God!

1026
01:25:03.992 --> 01:25:06.161
Mrs. Morrison.

1027
01:25:06.203 --> 01:25:08.288
Would you mind
coming down to the station


1028
01:25:08.330 --> 01:25:09.455
to answer a few questions?

1029
01:25:09.497 --> 01:25:12.125
Of course,
whatever you need.


1030
01:25:12.167 --> 01:25:14.669
Your husband's going to
meet us there, okay?


1031
01:25:14.711 --> 01:25:16.629
- Okay.
- Okay.


1032
01:25:32.812 --> 01:25:35.107
Pretty much
an open and shut case.


1033
01:25:40.820 --> 01:25:44.657
So... a writer, then.

1034
01:25:44.699 --> 01:25:48.287
Mm-hmm, yes.
Yes, I'm a writer. Um...


1035
01:25:48.328 --> 01:25:51.248
Is my husband here yet?
I'd really love to see him.


1036
01:25:51.290 --> 01:25:52.999
He's on his way, Mrs. Morrison.

1037
01:25:53.041 --> 01:25:54.709
In the meantime,

1038
01:25:54.751 --> 01:25:57.254
you mind telling me
what medications you're taking?


1039
01:25:57.296 --> 01:25:59.923
Any kind of psychosis you
may have been diagnosed with?


1040
01:26:01.091 --> 01:26:02.342
Wh
-What?

1041
01:26:04.094 --> 01:26:05.178
What is this?

1042
01:26:05.220 --> 01:26:06.972
We have footage of you, Mary.

1043
01:26:07.013 --> 01:26:08.974
Early this morning,
around 1:00 am,


1044
01:26:09.015 --> 01:26:11.351
driving to the location
of the deceased.


1045
01:26:12.936 --> 01:26:14.604
That's not possible.

1046
01:26:14.646 --> 01:26:17.232
And the deceased is my friend
and her name is Elaine.


1047
01:26:17.274 --> 01:26:19.401
We also have a witness,
a neighbor of yours,


1048
01:26:19.443 --> 01:26:21.778
saying you and Elaine were
in some sort of argument


1049
01:26:21.820 --> 01:26:23.529
yesterday evening
outside your home.


1050
01:26:23.571 --> 01:26:25.740
Do I need a lawyer present?
Because I thought I was


1051
01:26:25.782 --> 01:26:28.285
just coming here to help you
with the investigation.


1052
01:26:28.327 --> 01:26:30.996
And we have your fingerprints
on the murder weapon.


1053
01:26:31.037 --> 01:26:33.081
The scissors Elaine
were stabbed with.


1054
01:26:33.123 --> 01:26:34.958
That's just not possible.

1055
01:26:36.168 --> 01:26:40.005
Mary, the evidence
is all pointing one way.


1056
01:26:40.046 --> 01:26:42.007
You either tell me something
I don't know,


1057
01:26:42.048 --> 01:26:43.716
or I'll lay it out for you.

1058
01:27:01.526 --> 01:27:02.902
That could be anyone.

1059
01:27:02.944 --> 01:27:05.071
We found this too,
among your belongings


1060
01:27:05.113 --> 01:27:06.656
hidden in your writer's room.

1061
01:27:06.698 --> 01:27:09.075
Too many similarities
between this made up story


1062
01:27:09.117 --> 01:27:11.703
and the one going on
in real life, wouldn't you say?


1063
01:27:11.744 --> 01:27:13.830
No, this does not make sense!

1064
01:27:13.872 --> 01:27:16.666
Anyone else have access
to your work, Mrs. Morrison?


1065
01:27:16.708 --> 01:27:19.336
Yes, of course, my publisher.

1066
01:27:21.129 --> 01:27:23.631
- My husband.
- You're so hot.


1067
01:27:23.673 --> 01:27:25.758
Oh, and our nanny, Grace.

1068
01:27:25.800 --> 01:27:28.887
Mary, don't say another word.

1069
01:27:31.431 --> 01:27:32.765
Oh, babe.

1070
01:27:34.976 --> 01:27:37.187
Honey, I'm so sorry.

1071
01:27:37.229 --> 01:27:39.398
It's all right, we're gonna
figure this out.


1072
01:27:39.439 --> 01:27:40.899
How is Rick doing?

1073
01:27:41.983 --> 01:27:44.277
He's in shock.

1074
01:27:44.319 --> 01:27:46.238
He doesn't think
you did it, either.


1075
01:27:48.281 --> 01:27:52.452
I don't understand
how I'm the main suspect.


1076
01:27:52.494 --> 01:27:54.913
Well, they don't have enough
evidence to hold you.


1077
01:27:54.954 --> 01:27:56.456
But what...

1078
01:27:56.498 --> 01:27:58.708
What about the fingerprints
on the scissors?


1079
01:27:58.750 --> 01:28:01.378
Well, my fingerprints
are on them, too.


1080
01:28:01.420 --> 01:28:03.713
The kids' fingerprints
are on the scissors.


1081
01:28:10.262 --> 01:28:11.555
Mary, where, um...

1082
01:28:11.596 --> 01:28:13.806
Where...
Where were you last night?


1083
01:28:15.183 --> 01:28:18.644
I
-I got up to smoke...

1084
01:28:18.686 --> 01:28:21.773
and then I saw that the light
was on in my writer's room,


1085
01:28:21.814 --> 01:28:23.275
so I went there to check.

1086
01:28:23.316 --> 01:28:25.318
But nobody was there,

1087
01:28:25.360 --> 01:28:29.030
and I locked it up
and then I came back to bed.


1088
01:28:33.076 --> 01:28:34.827
- You didn't go anywhere else?
- Mm-mm.


1089
01:28:34.869 --> 01:28:36.746
After you checked the house,
you didn't...


1090
01:28:36.788 --> 01:28:38.957
No. No, honey.

1091
01:28:38.998 --> 01:28:41.334
You were gone
for nearly three hours.


1092
01:28:49.134 --> 01:28:51.219
Honey, really,
I came right back to bed.


1093
01:28:51.261 --> 01:28:52.929
You believe me, don't you?

1094
01:28:55.723 --> 01:28:57.892
The slashed tires on the bike...

1095
01:28:59.727 --> 01:29:02.230
They found a Swiss Army knife
in the garage


1096
01:29:02.272 --> 01:29:05.024
and the blade matches
the markings on the bike tire.


1097
01:29:05.066 --> 01:29:07.902
And yours are the only
fingerprints on that knife.


1098
01:29:21.082 --> 01:29:22.667
When was the last time

1099
01:29:22.708 --> 01:29:24.919
you were at Elaine's office
for a session?


1100
01:29:25.962 --> 01:29:27.422
Years ago.

1101
01:29:28.965 --> 01:29:32.677
Well, they found
some handwritten note that...


1102
01:29:32.718 --> 01:29:34.095
seemed like a diagnosis,

1103
01:29:34.137 --> 01:29:36.306
or that it outlined
what you have.


1104
01:29:36.348 --> 01:29:39.058
That is the time that I met her
at the gym to work out.


1105
01:29:39.100 --> 01:29:42.228
Those notes, they could be...
They could be about anyone.


1106
01:29:44.523 --> 01:29:45.815
I know.

1107
01:29:53.865 --> 01:29:57.202
Who would do such a thing?

1108
01:30:18.473 --> 01:30:19.723
Um...

1109
01:30:22.810 --> 01:30:25.897
I've got to go to
the restroom, okay?


1110
01:31:04.477 --> 01:31:06.521
I told them
you went home to rest.


1111
01:31:06.563 --> 01:31:08.772
Really, I'm on my ass
wanting to speak to you.


1112
01:31:08.814 --> 01:31:10.358
Where are you?

1113
01:31:15.697 --> 01:31:18.283
If you need something,
if you're in trouble...


1114
01:31:18.324 --> 01:31:19.701
I love you.

1115
01:31:21.077 --> 01:31:23.204
We can get you out.

1116
01:31:23.246 --> 01:31:24.956
Meet you at home.

1117
01:32:34.567 --> 01:32:36.736
I'm not buying anything.

1118
01:32:39.739 --> 01:32:42.116
There's no point
in standing there.


1119
01:32:42.158 --> 01:32:44.994
I'm sorry, ma'am,
I'm not selling anything.


1120
01:32:45.036 --> 01:32:47.079
I was just hoping
I could talk to you.


1121
01:32:47.121 --> 01:32:48.498
It's about Grace Taylor.

1122
01:32:48.540 --> 01:32:51.209
Yeah? What about her?

1123
01:32:51.250 --> 01:32:54.003
I'm her aunt.

1124
01:32:54.045 --> 01:32:57.006
Oh, um, I just drove
two hours to get here,


1125
01:32:57.048 --> 01:32:59.133
would it be okay,
I really need a restroom.


1126
01:32:59.175 --> 01:33:00.385
Could I come in?

1127
01:33:03.346 --> 01:33:04.347
Thank you so much.

1128
01:33:04.389 --> 01:33:05.598
Through there.

1129
01:33:05.640 --> 01:33:07.225
Okay, thank you.

1130
01:33:26.035 --> 01:33:28.872
I don't know what she wants.
Something about Grace.


1131
01:33:28.912 --> 01:33:31.249
What the hell
you let her in for,


1132
01:33:31.290 --> 01:33:33.125
for heaven sakes!

1133
01:33:44.303 --> 01:33:47.265
I am so sorry that I
just showed up like this.


1134
01:33:47.306 --> 01:33:50.017
It's just that I'm
Grace's employer.


1135
01:33:50.059 --> 01:33:51.519
She looks after my children.

1136
01:33:51.561 --> 01:33:53.354
I was hoping that
maybe you could help


1137
01:33:53.396 --> 01:33:55.273
answer a few questions
about her?


1138
01:33:58.317 --> 01:34:00.612
You're not from around here,
are you?


1139
01:34:02.154 --> 01:34:05.324
Christ.

1140
01:34:05.366 --> 01:34:08.411
Here we go again.

1141
01:34:08.453 --> 01:34:10.496
- Have a seat.
- Okay.


1142
01:34:14.292 --> 01:34:17.002
My Grace was one of the oldest.

1143
01:34:17.044 --> 01:34:20.757
After her parents
were sent to prison


1144
01:34:20.799 --> 01:34:23.468
for nearly starving
their children to death,


1145
01:34:23.509 --> 01:34:26.888
and God knows whatever else
they did to those kids,


1146
01:34:26.930 --> 01:34:29.098
she came here to live with me.

1147
01:34:31.434 --> 01:34:33.478
Last I heard, she got a job

1148
01:34:33.519 --> 01:34:35.772
at one of those
hoity-toity fitness clubs


1149
01:34:35.814 --> 01:34:37.649
in the city.

1150
01:34:37.690 --> 01:34:40.067
I said no!

1151
01:34:40.109 --> 01:34:42.445
Idiot, get back in there!

1152
01:34:42.487 --> 01:34:45.364
Dumb dog!

1153
01:34:45.406 --> 01:34:46.658
Christ!

1154
01:34:58.210 --> 01:35:00.588
That's a good boy.

1155
01:35:00.630 --> 01:35:03.048
That's a good boy.

1156
01:35:03.090 --> 01:35:06.385
That's a good boy.

1157
01:35:06.427 --> 01:35:09.096
Ohh! That's a good boy.

1158
01:35:15.937 --> 01:35:17.730
This could be the perfect thing

1159
01:35:17.772 --> 01:35:19.398
to kick your ass out the door.

1160
01:35:19.440 --> 01:35:22.777
Use it as momentum
to enter into a new chapter


1161
01:35:22.819 --> 01:35:24.612
and to do the things
that you want to do,


1162
01:35:24.654 --> 01:35:28.366
so you can create the things
you want to create.


1163
01:35:32.161 --> 01:35:33.663
...run errands, everything.

1164
01:35:33.705 --> 01:35:35.164
I'm telling you, Mary, this is

1165
01:35:35.206 --> 01:35:37.750
exactly what you need
to get through.


1166
01:35:45.466 --> 01:35:47.677
You have a lot going for you,
Grace.


1167
01:35:47.719 --> 01:35:49.094
Many talents.

1168
01:36:16.121 --> 01:36:18.207
As I was saying...

1169
01:36:18.249 --> 01:36:21.836
You are obviously a delightful
and talented young woman.


1170
01:36:21.878 --> 01:36:23.671
Unfortunately, we
just aren't taking on


1171
01:36:23.713 --> 01:36:25.590
any new caregivers
at the moment.


1172
01:36:25.631 --> 01:36:28.009
We'll be sure to keep you
in mind for the future, though.


1173
01:36:28.051 --> 01:36:29.427
I really need this job.

1174
01:36:40.521 --> 01:36:41.773
What is it?

1175
01:36:42.732 --> 01:36:44.316
I'm not fancy enough?

1176
01:36:44.358 --> 01:36:46.485
Didn't go to the right schools?

1177
01:36:46.527 --> 01:36:49.321
I'm overqualified
compared to those brats!


1178
01:36:49.363 --> 01:36:52.283
I'm sure you'll find a nice
family who needs your help.


1179
01:36:52.324 --> 01:36:53.868
Plenty of them exist.

1180
01:36:55.160 --> 01:36:56.412
Bitch.

1181
01:37:04.378 --> 01:37:07.130
We'll be sure to keep you in
mind for the future, though.


1182
01:37:07.172 --> 01:37:09.300
Thank you for
seeing me so soon.


1183
01:37:09.341 --> 01:37:10.718
I really appreciate it.

1184
01:37:10.760 --> 01:37:12.971
And if you need help
with anything at all


1185
01:37:13.012 --> 01:37:15.056
around the office,
cleaning, whatever...


1186
01:37:15.098 --> 01:37:17.182
You're at the top of my list.

1187
01:37:21.604 --> 01:37:23.731
Tom, I'm on my way, okay?

1188
01:37:23.773 --> 01:37:27.652
But whatever you do, do not
let Grace into the house.


1189
01:37:27.693 --> 01:37:30.780
I have reason to believe
that she's really dangerous.


1190
01:37:30.822 --> 01:37:33.908
So, whatever you do,
please don't let Grace in.


1191
01:37:33.950 --> 01:37:35.910
Tom?

1192
01:37:35.952 --> 01:37:38.287
Tom?

1193
01:37:38.329 --> 01:37:42.416
After it's over,

1194
01:37:42.458 --> 01:37:45.336
But I turn
into a different person...


1195
01:39:03.122 --> 01:39:05.332
Hey, babe, is that you?

1196
01:39:10.713 --> 01:39:12.965
Yep, it's me.

1197
01:39:16.928 --> 01:39:19.597
I thought we could use
a little playtime.


1198
01:39:24.227 --> 01:39:25.895
Grace, I already told you,

1199
01:39:25.937 --> 01:39:28.731
I don't want to play these
games with you anymore.


1200
01:39:28.773 --> 01:39:31.692
You told me you loved games.

1201
01:39:31.734 --> 01:39:34.612
All men love games.

1202
01:39:34.653 --> 01:39:37.322
You've been
a terrible boy, Tom.


1203
01:39:38.741 --> 01:39:40.618
And it's time for you to pay.

1204
01:39:41.911 --> 01:39:44.247
Are you sure you
don't want to reconsider?


1205
01:39:45.831 --> 01:39:48.084
- Now, you listen...
- No, you listen!


1206
01:39:48.126 --> 01:39:49.961
You will do exactly as I say

1207
01:39:50.002 --> 01:39:51.420
or suffer the consequences.

1208
01:39:51.462 --> 01:39:52.755
What are you talking about?

1209
01:39:52.797 --> 01:39:54.548
Are you crazy?
Are you fucking insane?!


1210
01:39:56.425 --> 01:39:59.011
One thing you should
know about me, Tom,


1211
01:39:59.053 --> 01:40:01.680
is I'm completely insane.

1212
01:40:01.722 --> 01:40:03.849
And I always get what I want.

1213
01:40:10.273 --> 01:40:12.733
I don't want to have
to hurt you, but I will.


1214
01:40:14.526 --> 01:40:16.279
You hurt me?

1215
01:40:16.319 --> 01:40:18.281
That's hilarious.

1216
01:40:18.321 --> 01:40:19.991
Oh!

1217
01:40:27.581 --> 01:40:29.083
Wait! Grace!

1218
01:40:33.004 --> 01:40:34.172
Grace!

1219
01:40:37.883 --> 01:40:39.760
Ha, see?

1220
01:40:39.802 --> 01:40:41.887
I told you,

1221
01:40:41.929 --> 01:40:44.056
I always get what I want.

1222
01:41:00.363 --> 01:41:01.573
Tom?

1223
01:41:04.451 --> 01:41:05.911
Honey?

1224
01:41:05.953 --> 01:41:07.163
Mary...

1225
01:41:07.205 --> 01:41:08.622
Here!

1226
01:41:08.664 --> 01:41:10.249
Coming!

1227
01:41:19.925 --> 01:41:21.135
Kids?

1228
01:41:22.678 --> 01:41:23.888
Kids?

1229
01:41:25.890 --> 01:41:27.474
Tom, where are you?

1230
01:41:27.516 --> 01:41:28.851
Oh, Mary!

1231
01:41:28.893 --> 01:41:30.186
- I'm so glad you're here!
- Grace!


1232
01:41:30.228 --> 01:41:31.645
Where are the twins?
Where's Tom?


1233
01:41:31.687 --> 01:41:34.106
The twins are
in the game room, safe.


1234
01:41:34.148 --> 01:41:35.607
Tom has...

1235
01:41:35.649 --> 01:41:37.735
Oh, No-no-no-no!
Don't go in there!


1236
01:41:37.776 --> 01:41:39.028
It
-It's a mess.

1237
01:41:39.070 --> 01:41:41.072
- I'll get some things...
- Tom?!


1238
01:41:41.113 --> 01:41:43.574
- Tom!
- I'll clean it!


1239
01:41:43.615 --> 01:41:45.034
Where are you?

1240
01:41:45.076 --> 01:41:47.245
- Here... in here.
- Tom!


1241
01:41:47.286 --> 01:41:49.496
I'm in...

1242
01:41:49.538 --> 01:41:51.623
- I'm in here.
- Oh, my God!


1243
01:41:52.666 --> 01:41:54.459
Oh, my God!
What happened?!


1244
01:41:54.501 --> 01:41:57.129
I... I didn't mean to...
I never wanted to...


1245
01:41:57.171 --> 01:41:59.340
- Honey, don't talk.
- You gotta believe me...


1246
01:41:59.382 --> 01:42:00.423
I do!

1247
01:42:00.465 --> 01:42:02.593
She sedu... seduced me!

1248
01:42:02.634 --> 01:42:04.553
- It's all right.
- I never want...


1249
01:42:04.595 --> 01:42:07.598
Okay, okay, I believe you,
please, don't talk.


1250
01:42:07.639 --> 01:42:09.850
Just hang in there, okay?

1251
01:42:11.727 --> 01:42:14.521
Oh! I'm-I'm so sorry
for the mess!


1252
01:42:17.400 --> 01:42:19.735
Grace!
Grace!


1253
01:42:19.777 --> 01:42:23.948
I need you to call 911
right now! Right now!


1254
01:42:23.989 --> 01:42:26.033
Okay. Right, right, right!

1255
01:42:26.075 --> 01:42:27.618
Um...

1256
01:42:29.494 --> 01:42:31.789
Hello? Yes, um...

1257
01:42:31.830 --> 01:42:33.207
We need an ambulance.

1258
01:42:33.249 --> 01:42:35.376
Yes, um, there's a man

1259
01:42:35.418 --> 01:42:37.336
and he's-he's...
he's dying!


1260
01:42:37.378 --> 01:42:39.964
And he's gonna bleed to death
if you don't come soon.


1261
01:42:40.005 --> 01:42:42.133
Please hurry! Please hurry!

1262
01:42:44.969 --> 01:42:46.095
Grace?

1263
01:42:46.137 --> 01:42:47.596
Who did this?

1264
01:42:47.638 --> 01:42:50.433
I don't know.

1265
01:42:53.144 --> 01:42:54.812
I tried to stop her!

1266
01:42:54.853 --> 01:42:56.981
I told her
you were nice people


1267
01:42:57.022 --> 01:42:59.066
- and you could help us.
- Honey...


1268
01:42:59.108 --> 01:43:00.859
You tried to stop who?

1269
01:43:08.867 --> 01:43:11.162
Me, you cunt!

1270
01:43:11.203 --> 01:43:12.955
Margaret.

1271
01:43:15.791 --> 01:43:17.335
Kill her, bitch!

1272
01:43:17.376 --> 01:43:19.462
I don't want to! Please!

1273
01:43:19.502 --> 01:43:20.712
Please don't make me!

1274
01:43:20.754 --> 01:43:22.047
Don't ma...

1275
01:43:22.089 --> 01:43:23.966
You have to kill her!

1276
01:43:24.008 --> 01:43:26.844
She betrayed you.
She doesn't love you.


1277
01:43:26.885 --> 01:43:28.804
Yes, yes, she does.

1278
01:43:28.846 --> 01:43:30.681
She does love me!
She does!


1279
01:43:30.722 --> 01:43:33.476
You love me, Mary, right?

1280
01:43:35.144 --> 01:43:36.437
Grace?

1281
01:43:36.479 --> 01:43:38.063
Kill her, bitch!

1282
01:43:38.105 --> 01:43:39.564
Mary?

1283
01:43:39.606 --> 01:43:41.359
Kill her, bitch!

1284
01:43:41.400 --> 01:43:43.444
- Kill her, bitch!
- I can't stop her.


1285
01:43:43.486 --> 01:43:45.196
- Run! Run, Mary!
- Run!


1286
01:43:47.031 --> 01:43:50.034
Kill her, bitch!
Kill her, bitch!


1287
01:44:08.844 --> 01:44:10.137
Hey!

1288
01:44:33.994 --> 01:44:36.621
Mary!

1289
01:44:38.499 --> 01:44:40.583
- Grace?
- How could you?


1290
01:44:42.169 --> 01:44:43.921
You bitch!

1291
01:44:55.474 --> 01:44:58.143
Too bad, so sad.

1292
01:44:58.185 --> 01:45:01.313
And Grace was actually
starting to like you.


1293
01:45:01.355 --> 01:45:03.399
Thought she could
get rid of me.


1294
01:45:03.441 --> 01:45:05.192
Replace me with you.

1295
01:45:05.234 --> 01:45:06.609
I did get rid of you!

1296
01:45:06.651 --> 01:45:08.362
Leave me alone!

1297
01:45:10.114 --> 01:45:12.615
Now, we know that can
never happen now, don't we?


1298
01:45:12.657 --> 01:45:15.327
How would we
ever get along in this world


1299
01:45:15.369 --> 01:45:17.288
if it weren't for me?

1300
01:45:34.763 --> 01:45:36.223
Let's play our game?

1301
01:45:36.265 --> 01:45:38.142
Not now, Adam.

1302
01:45:38.183 --> 01:45:40.311
Come on, please?

1303
01:45:44.482 --> 01:45:46.191
You be Margaret.

1304
01:45:48.277 --> 01:45:49.903
I'm the survivor.

1305
01:45:49.945 --> 01:45:52.490
I'm the one who
got us through hell!


1306
01:45:52.531 --> 01:45:54.908
And this whore
just thinks she can


1307
01:45:54.950 --> 01:45:57.578
waltz right in and replace me?

1308
01:45:57.620 --> 01:45:59.330
Because of love?

1309
01:45:59.371 --> 01:46:01.957
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

1310
01:46:01.999 --> 01:46:06.669
- This isn't love.
- Shut up!


1311
01:46:06.711 --> 01:46:08.839
All people want to do

1312
01:46:08.880 --> 01:46:10.966
is use you!

1313
01:46:11.008 --> 01:46:14.094
Eat you up and
spit you out, Grace!


1314
01:46:14.136 --> 01:46:17.264
Until there is
nothing left of you!


1315
01:46:17.306 --> 01:46:18.807
That's not true!

1316
01:46:18.849 --> 01:46:21.393
We have to
make her go away, Grace!


1317
01:46:21.435 --> 01:46:22.978
No, please!

1318
01:46:23.020 --> 01:46:24.771
Leave me alone!

1319
01:46:24.813 --> 01:46:27.232
No, the bitch must die!

1320
01:46:27.274 --> 01:46:28.984
No, this is wrong!

1321
01:46:29.026 --> 01:46:30.569
Kill her! Kill her!

1322
01:46:30.611 --> 01:46:32.863
I said stop!

1323
01:46:40.329 --> 01:46:43.457
Grace! Grace, Grace.

1324
01:46:43.499 --> 01:46:44.707
Grace?

1325
01:46:44.749 --> 01:46:46.709
Mary...

1326
01:46:48.212 --> 01:46:50.214
I'm sorry.

1327
01:46:53.258 --> 01:46:54.926
Please don't give up on me.

1328
01:46:56.094 --> 01:46:57.388
I won't.

1329
01:46:57.429 --> 01:46:59.557
I love you, Mary.

1330
01:47:01.141 --> 01:47:03.561
I love you, too, sweet girl.

1331
01:48:07.750 --> 01:48:10.252
Working on a new book
in the series, Ms. Morrison?


1332
01:48:10.294 --> 01:48:12.837
Actually, no, I'm
doing something different


1333
01:48:12.879 --> 01:48:15.257
that I've been
wanting to do for a long time.


1334
01:48:16.508 --> 01:48:17.718
Bye.

1335
01:48:18.761 --> 01:48:19.970
Bye.

1336
01:48:25.517 --> 01:48:26.893
I did it.

1337
01:48:29.480 --> 01:48:32.566
All I needed was to
get my ass kicked out the door.


1338
01:48:34.359 --> 01:48:35.653
It's all for you.

1339
01:49:00.803 --> 01:49:02.012
Hi.

1340
01:49:42.845 --> 01:49:44.471
Deal me in.

1341
01:49:44.513 --> 01:49:46.640
Mary!

1342
01:49:47.974 --> 01:49:49.309
Mm, I've missed you!

1343
01:49:49.351 --> 01:49:51.395
Aw, I've missed you, too.

1344
01:49:51.436 --> 01:49:53.271
I have something for you.

1345
01:49:56.899 --> 01:49:58.819
Ta-da!

1346
01:49:58.861 --> 01:50:00.945
Oh, you're the best!

1347
01:50:00.987 --> 01:50:02.531
Simply the best!

1348
01:50:02.573 --> 01:50:04.408
- Thank you!
- You're welcome!


1349
01:50:04.449 --> 01:50:05.868
What are we gonna play?

1350
01:50:05.908 --> 01:50:07.369
Um, Crazy Eights.

1351
01:50:07.411 --> 01:50:08.871
Okay!

1352
01:50:13.958 --> 01:50:16.670
Four, five,

1353
01:50:16.712 --> 01:50:19.297
six, seven,

1354
01:50:19.339 --> 01:50:21.091
eight.
