00:00:38.349 --> 00:00:39.816
- Hi there.
- Hi.


2
00:00:39.917 --> 00:00:42.010
So glad to see you.

3
00:00:42.253 --> 00:00:44.517
Kathy, could you take that?

4
00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:46.756
Thank you.

5
00:00:47.125 --> 00:00:49.821
It's my job to market this drug for
Bristol-Myers, and I'm telling you,


6
00:00:49.927 --> 00:00:53.727
kids won't go for it
unless it tastes like bubble gum.


7
00:00:53.865 --> 00:00:57.392
- Mr. Crowley, you're late.
- All right. Thank you. Bye.


8
00:01:13.584 --> 00:01:15.279
"Everyone just walked by.

9
00:01:15.419 --> 00:01:19.014
"'W hy won't anyone buy our newspaper?<i>'</i>
SpongeBob wondered aloud.


10
00:01:19.123 --> 00:01:22.024
"'T hey must be rock haters,<i>'</i> said Patrick."

11
00:01:22.126 --> 00:01:26.358
- John! Give it back to me!
- She's mine now!


12
00:01:26.464 --> 00:01:29.024
- Give me a minute, okay?
- Give it back to me, John!


13
00:01:29.133 --> 00:01:31.124
You save our spot. Got it?

14
00:01:31.269 --> 00:01:33.464
You better give me back my Fiona!

15
00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:36.770
Help, Mom!

16
00:01:37.441 --> 00:01:41.309
- Help me! She's trying to kill me!
- I'm gonna get you!


17
00:01:41.445 --> 00:01:44.209
- You can't escape!
- No! Mom, help me!


18
00:01:45.183 --> 00:01:46.616
Just give it back to me.

19
00:01:47.351 --> 00:01:51.447
- Mom! She's trying to kill me!
- Megan Kathryn Crowley.


20
00:01:54.358 --> 00:01:56.656
If you kill your brother,
you cannot have your party.


21
00:01:56.794 --> 00:01:58.785
Why not? He stole Fiona.

22
00:01:58.896 --> 00:02:02.627
I didn't steal her, I kidnapped her.
I'm holding her for ransom.


23
00:02:02.733 --> 00:02:04.530
Release the victim.

24
00:02:07.638 --> 00:02:09.037
Time to get ready for your party.

25
00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:11.838
We've got to get moving on
the product launch.


26
00:02:11.976 --> 00:02:13.534
<i>I'm just waiting on legal, John.</i>

27
00:02:13.678 --> 00:02:15.043
Damn it!

28
00:02:15.346 --> 00:02:17.041
I just missed my train.
I'm gonna have to call you...


29
00:02:17.181 --> 00:02:19.342
<i>I agree. How soon do you need it?</i>

30
00:02:19.483 --> 00:02:21.883
As soon as possible.
I'm presenting to my boss next week.


31
00:02:24.222 --> 00:02:27.282
John, we're loading up the van right now.
Come on!


32
00:02:27.391 --> 00:02:30.053
- Okay, we ready to roll, Kate?
- My name is Jane.


33
00:02:30.194 --> 00:02:32.992
- Kate was yesterday, Mom.
- I am so sorry.


34
00:02:33.097 --> 00:02:34.997
The way the agency shuffles
day nurses on us,


35
00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:37.897
you'd think they'd, you know,
give you a number instead of a name.


36
00:02:39.937 --> 00:02:41.461
Okay, John.

37
00:02:42.406 --> 00:02:45.034
John, come on, get
your butt in the car.

38
00:02:45.176 --> 00:02:46.370
John.

39
00:02:46.878 --> 00:02:48.368
- Are you bringing your RipStik?
- Yes.


40
00:02:48.512 --> 00:02:50.412
- Do you have to?
- Yes.


41
00:02:53.618 --> 00:02:55.347
...a pain, that's why.
Wait, I gotta catch a cab.


42
00:02:55.453 --> 00:02:57.819
Hi. Come here. Hey, hey. Hello?

43
00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:04.326
- Daddy's meeting us there, right?
- Absolutely.


44
00:03:05.263 --> 00:03:08.494
I am sure he has everything under control.

45
00:03:09.467 --> 00:03:11.094
Taxi!

46
00:03:18.075 --> 00:03:19.906
You need a hand?

47
00:03:20.044 --> 00:03:23.502
Great. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm kind of in a hurry.


48
00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.121
Go.

49
00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.923
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.


50
00:03:40.064 --> 00:03:41.190
Yes!

51
00:03:54.078 --> 00:03:55.204
Yes!

52
00:03:55.746 --> 00:03:57.771
He totally promised he'd be here by now.

53
00:03:57.915 --> 00:04:00.145
He's on his way, baby. 
He's on his way.

54
00:04:11.128 --> 00:04:12.459
Hi, guys.

55
00:04:15.833 --> 00:04:17.130
- Get in there and give her a kiss.
- I know.


56
00:04:17.268 --> 00:04:19.930
- I don't wanna hear it. I don't wanna hear it.
- Go, go, go.


57
00:04:20.037 --> 00:04:22.232
Happy birthday. I made it.

58
00:04:22.974 --> 00:04:24.339
- Yay!
- Yay!


59
00:04:26.043 --> 00:04:28.102
Make a wish, Megan.

60
00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:32.441
Who wants cake?

61
00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.017
- I do!
- I do!


62
00:04:34.652 --> 00:04:37.985
Line up single file,
or no cake for you.

63
00:04:38.122 --> 00:04:40.818
- All right, how many do we have?
- I'm first! Me first!


64
00:04:41.792 --> 00:04:44.818
- No, I'm the big guy.
- Back to the end of the line.


65
00:04:53.537 --> 00:04:57.439
So, where is Fiona going, anyway?

66
00:04:58.576 --> 00:05:00.271
Lollipop Land?

67
00:05:00.978 --> 00:05:03.879
I'm eight, Daddy. 
I'm not a baby anymore.

68
00:05:07.218 --> 00:05:10.346
She's driving to Antarctica
to see the penguins.


69
00:05:10.488 --> 00:05:13.719
Really? That's pretty far away.

70
00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.886
Why doesn't she just go
to the Portland Zoo?


71
00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:20.463
They have a lot of penguins there, too.

72
00:05:20.564 --> 00:05:23.727
- Haven't you ever heard of adventure?
- Yeah.


73
00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:26.796
It's gonna take her years.

74
00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:30.907
Won't she need a suitcase?

75
00:05:31.042 --> 00:05:33.738
It's an adventure.
You don't need a suitcase on an adventure.


76
00:05:33.878 --> 00:05:36.176
Well, I don't know about you,
but if I was going on an adventure,


77
00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:37.474
I would take a suitcase.

78
00:05:37.581 --> 00:05:42.018
- That's 'cause you're a businessman.
- That's right. I am.


79
00:05:42.119 --> 00:05:46.385
And you're eight years old.
And happy birthday. And I love you.


80
00:05:46.524 --> 00:05:48.685
Love you, too, Daddy.

81
00:05:49.093 --> 00:05:52.927
- Good night. See you in the morning.
- Good night.


82
00:05:54.632 --> 00:05:56.156
Nighty-night.

83
00:05:57.868 --> 00:05:59.859
Sweet dreams.

84
00:06:04.241 --> 00:06:05.936
Good night, Dad.

85
00:06:13.117 --> 00:06:15.608
- Good night, Daddy.
- Night, buddy.


86
00:08:22.179 --> 00:08:24.739
- Hello?
<i>- Hello, Dr. Stonehill?</i>


87
00:08:26.183 --> 00:08:28.981
<i>- Are you there? Hello?</i>
- Yeah.


88
00:08:29.954 --> 00:08:33.788
This is John Crowley. I don't know
if you've gotten any of my messages.


89
00:08:33.924 --> 00:08:35.983
- Who?
<i>- John...</i>


90
00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:37.449
Jesus.

91
00:08:37.595 --> 00:08:41.087
I'm interested in speaking with you.
I understand from many researchers...


92
00:08:43.601 --> 00:08:45.762
...having a conversation with you
if that's convenient.


93
00:08:45.869 --> 00:08:47.063
Is this a good time to talk?

94
00:08:50.708 --> 00:08:53.268
Dr. Stonehill? Hello?

95
00:08:56.313 --> 00:08:59.407
<i>- Asshole.</i>
- "Asshole?"


96
00:09:40.924 --> 00:09:42.323
The night nurse just left.

97
00:09:45.496 --> 00:09:46.758
What time is it?

98
00:09:48.866 --> 00:09:50.060
I missed you.

99
00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:56.738
This is pathetic. 
I'm still dressed.

100
00:09:57.441 --> 00:10:00.569
I could help you with that.

101
00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:19.359
Oh my... Kate!
Hi! You're early.


102
00:10:19.463 --> 00:10:20.430
6:00.

103
00:10:20.531 --> 00:10:24.092
- Have you met...
- I'm John Crowley.


104
00:10:24.935 --> 00:10:26.800
John is my husband.

105
00:10:27.538 --> 00:10:28.505
Glad to hear it.

106
00:10:47.691 --> 00:10:49.989
Yeah, let's up
her breathing treatments today.


107
00:10:50.094 --> 00:10:54.531
- What's going on?
- Just a cold. She's awfully congested.


108
00:10:54.865 --> 00:10:58.824
- Call the doc just to be on the safe side?
- Yeah, I left word.


109
00:10:59.203 --> 00:11:03.139
Sweetie? I'm gonna go to work, okay?

110
00:11:03.741 --> 00:11:05.231
Feel better.

111
00:11:07.211 --> 00:11:08.576
Bye-bye.

112
00:11:10.247 --> 00:11:12.875
We're already doing great
marketing the drug to physicians.


113
00:11:13.016 --> 00:11:15.678
It's our direct marketing to patients
we need to beef up.


114
00:11:15.786 --> 00:11:17.686
Mr. Crowley, I'm really sorry.

115
00:11:17.788 --> 00:11:20.586
Aileen's on the line,
she really needs to speak to you.


116
00:11:20.724 --> 00:11:23.557
Okay, thank you. 
I'm just gonna... Hey.

117
00:11:23.694 --> 00:11:26.891
We're at the hospital.
The doc wants Megan under observation.


118
00:11:27.197 --> 00:11:30.223
- Is she all right?
<i>- Just keep your cell with you.</i>


119
00:11:30.367 --> 00:11:33.234
- Okay. Can I do something?
<i>- I'll call you when I know more.</i>


120
00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:36.999
I should really get back to Megan, so I'll call
you as soon as I know anything, okay?


121
00:11:37.107 --> 00:11:38.665
Bye. Love you.

122
00:11:47.985 --> 00:11:49.509
- Excuse me, please.
- Sir?


123
00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:52.350
My daughter, Megan Crowley,
was brought in for observation.


124
00:11:52.456 --> 00:11:55.755
Yeah.
Actually, they're moving her to the ICU.


125
00:11:55.893 --> 00:11:57.724
- Where?
- That way.


126
00:11:59.663 --> 00:12:01.722
- Aileen.
- John.


127
00:12:02.099 --> 00:12:06.126
Has she told you about the trip that Fiona's
taking with her remote-controlled car?


128
00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:08.898
Yeah, yes, she did. You're right.
That's right, sweetie.


129
00:12:09.006 --> 00:12:11.566
You're gonna see
all the penguins, aren't you?


130
00:12:11.675 --> 00:12:13.905
She might send some postcards
or something like that.


131
00:12:14.011 --> 00:12:15.876
- Lots of good stuff to see along the way...
- It's okay.


132
00:12:15.979 --> 00:12:19.710
...like icebergs and maybe a polar bear.

133
00:12:20.651 --> 00:12:22.482
How about some seals?

134
00:12:42.539 --> 00:12:46.771
As you know, Pompe patients suffer muscle
deterioration in every part of the body,


135
00:12:46.877 --> 00:12:53.146
so this sort of respiratory complication, well,
that's just an inevitable fact of the disease.


136
00:12:56.854 --> 00:13:00.187
Mr. Crowley, Mrs. Crowley,

137
00:13:01.992 --> 00:13:05.291
Megan is not responding well.

138
00:13:06.063 --> 00:13:09.999
Okay? Now, we've done everything we can,
but she's just...


139
00:13:10.133 --> 00:13:13.534
There's nothing more we can do. I'm sorry.

140
00:13:14.371 --> 00:13:20.332
As you know, she was already well past the
life expectancy, for, you know, Pompe kids.


141
00:13:21.411 --> 00:13:24.608
After all, it's not just her lungs, okay?

142
00:13:24.715 --> 00:13:28.776
Her heart, her liver,
these organs have been compromised


143
00:13:28.886 --> 00:13:31.719
and would've become fatally enlarged.

144
00:13:32.823 --> 00:13:37.157
Now, I wish that we had a drug
to treat Pompe, but we simply don't.


145
00:13:37.895 --> 00:13:39.988
I'm so very sorry.

146
00:13:42.499 --> 00:13:44.023
Look, maybe...

147
00:13:44.601 --> 00:13:49.868
Maybe you can find some small comfort in
knowing that Megan's suffering will be over.


148
00:13:49.973 --> 00:13:53.966
Maybe you can see this as a blessing.

149
00:14:28.912 --> 00:14:30.243
- Megan?
- Help!


150
00:14:30.347 --> 00:14:31.780
- Help! Help!
- Megan?


151
00:14:31.915 --> 00:14:33.610
Help! Help!

152
00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:35.809
Baby girl, can you hear me?

153
00:14:35.953 --> 00:14:38.387
- Please, someone come help!
- 321!


154
00:14:38.488 --> 00:14:40.547
- Megan Crowley, room 321, please!
- Code Blue!


155
00:14:40.657 --> 00:14:42.750
- Baby girl, Mama's here, all right?
- Let's go! Page Dr. Heder.


156
00:14:42.859 --> 00:14:44.053
- Asystole!
- Yeah, right through here.


157
00:14:44.161 --> 00:14:45.822
Can you hear my voice?
Can you hear Mama?


158
00:14:45.963 --> 00:14:48.261
- Starting compressions.
- I'll switch her out.


159
00:14:48.365 --> 00:14:50.162
- Over here, please. Quickly.
- Hang in there, Megan.


160
00:14:50.267 --> 00:14:52.201
- Hang in there, baby, okay?
- I need to bag her.


161
00:14:52.302 --> 00:14:53.769
- Aileen?
- Some room right there.


162
00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:55.064
Let us in, all right?

163
00:14:55.172 --> 00:14:56.867
- Please, Mrs. Crowley, let...
- Stop it!


164
00:14:56.974 --> 00:14:58.032
Let us help her!

165
00:14:58.141 --> 00:14:59.836
- Please... Megan!
- Aileen.


166
00:14:59.943 --> 00:15:02.343
- Epinephrine, 0.1 mils per kig.
- Got it.


167
00:15:02.446 --> 00:15:04.346
Still no pulse. No reading.

168
00:15:04.448 --> 00:15:06.678
- Forget the weight, come on, get it in there!
- Aileen, Aileen.


169
00:15:06.783 --> 00:15:07.943
- 0.1 epi.
- It's all right.


170
00:15:08.051 --> 00:15:10.076
- Come on, Megs. Come on. Come on.
- IV push.


171
00:15:10.187 --> 00:15:14.351
- Okay, just give the epi a couple seconds.
- Still non-responsive.


172
00:15:14.458 --> 00:15:16.085
- All right, charge the defib.
- Charging.


173
00:15:41.318 --> 00:15:43.650
Your daughter is some fighter.

174
00:15:45.022 --> 00:15:47.217
- She's gonna be okay.
- Oh, my God.


175
00:15:47.324 --> 00:15:50.725
Now, look,
she's still a very sick girl, obviously,


176
00:15:50.827 --> 00:15:55.787
but her vital signs have improved
and I'm cautiously optimistic.


177
00:15:57.834 --> 00:16:01.361
So, I guess you could say
we dodged that blessing, huh?


178
00:16:08.879 --> 00:16:12.975
- Mrs. Crowley, these came for Megan.
- Thanks so much. Thank you.


179
00:16:48.218 --> 00:16:49.344
Hey, John?

180
00:16:51.722 --> 00:16:53.883
Any time you're ready, man.

181
00:16:54.791 --> 00:16:57.783
You gonna tell us
about the product launch?


182
00:17:02.332 --> 00:17:03.959
John, you okay?

183
00:17:04.668 --> 00:17:06.226
I have to go.

184
00:17:07.337 --> 00:17:08.361
John.

185
00:17:10.006 --> 00:17:12.236
- Where you going?
- Nebraska.


186
00:17:39.803 --> 00:17:42.738
Excuse me, please.
There's a gentleman here to see you.


187
00:17:51.648 --> 00:17:54.344
Best make yourself comfortable, hon.

188
00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:18.034
Oh, dear.

189
00:18:18.642 --> 00:18:21.611
Sir, sir.
That's Dr. Stonehill. He just left, I'm sorry.


190
00:18:21.711 --> 00:18:23.372
- Thank you.
- Yeah.


191
00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:25.604
Dr. Stonehill!

192
00:18:28.852 --> 00:18:30.683
Hey, Dr. Stonehill!

193
00:19:38.822 --> 00:19:40.414
Dr. Stonehill?

194
00:19:42.125 --> 00:19:44.389
- Yeah?
- I'm John Crowley.


195
00:19:45.762 --> 00:19:48.560
- Okay.
- Didn't you get any of my messages?


196
00:19:49.532 --> 00:19:50.590
What messages?

197
00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:52.998
I left you three or four messages
in the last month,


198
00:19:53.103 --> 00:19:55.833
and you even hung up on me
the night before last.


199
00:19:55.939 --> 00:19:59.602
What the hell are you talking about?
I never hung up on you.


200
00:20:00.477 --> 00:20:03.469
Dr. Stonehill, two of my kids have Pompe.

201
00:20:04.648 --> 00:20:06.240
Oh, Jesus.

202
00:20:09.219 --> 00:20:10.914
Well, I'm sorry.

203
00:20:11.721 --> 00:20:13.416
A terrible disease,

204
00:20:13.523 --> 00:20:16.253
but, hell, you shouldn't have come
all this way without talking to me.


205
00:20:16.359 --> 00:20:19.419
I do research, son. 
I don't see patients.

206
00:20:19.529 --> 00:20:21.724
Well, it's your research
that I'm interested in.


207
00:20:21.831 --> 00:20:25.597
I've read all the journal articles
on Pompe disease,


208
00:20:26.169 --> 00:20:30.105
and all the researchers out there say
that your work holds the most promise.


209
00:20:30.206 --> 00:20:33.369
Get to the point, son.
What do you want from me?


210
00:20:33.476 --> 00:20:36.274
We almost lost my daughter last week.

211
00:20:39.883 --> 00:20:42.613
I need to hear about your research.

212
00:20:47.657 --> 00:20:50.285
Your kids have a genetic disease.

213
00:20:51.261 --> 00:20:52.785
They're missing an enzyme

214
00:20:52.896 --> 00:20:56.627
which metabolizes
a certain kind of sugar, glycogen.


215
00:20:56.733 --> 00:20:59.702
It's defective in Pompe patients.

216
00:21:00.503 --> 00:21:02.664
So, this sugar builds
up in the muscle cells,

217
00:21:02.772 --> 00:21:07.141
especially in the heart, the skeletal muscles,
the diaphragm,


218
00:21:07.243 --> 00:21:09.268
which is why they have
a hard time breathing.


219
00:21:09.379 --> 00:21:13.247
- Yeah, I know. I know a lot about that.
- Everybody's making an enzyme,


220
00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:16.911
but you can infuse kids all day long
with their enzyme,


221
00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:21.753
and it's not gonna do any good
'cause it's not gonna get into their cells.


222
00:21:21.891 --> 00:21:22.915
Understand what I'm saying?

223
00:21:23.026 --> 00:21:24.584
Yeah, so that means
that if you put the sugar...


224
00:21:24.694 --> 00:21:26.025
- Don't interrupt.
- Sorry.


225
00:21:26.129 --> 00:21:29.621
I'm making a different version
of this enzyme.


226
00:21:29.733 --> 00:21:34.261
My enzyme has a biological marker,
mannose 6-phosphate.


227
00:21:34.404 --> 00:21:38.033
I'm the only one that's cloned the gene
for phosphotransferase.


228
00:21:38.141 --> 00:21:40.974
I'm the only one who's cloned the gene
for uncovering enzyme,


229
00:21:41.077 --> 00:21:45.207
so I can get more mannose 6-phosphate
onto the lysosomal protein,


230
00:21:45.315 --> 00:21:50.343
and I can deliver
a more effective amount of enzyme


231
00:21:51.287 --> 00:21:52.447
into the cells.

232
00:21:52.555 --> 00:21:54.386
That's why people are citing my work.

233
00:21:54.491 --> 00:21:56.482
That's why you read my name
in the literature.


234
00:21:56.593 --> 00:21:59.858
I can get more enzyme into the cells.

235
00:22:01.297 --> 00:22:04.960
What's the matter, Sal?
Not up on your glycobiology?


236
00:22:05.902 --> 00:22:07.699
I thought Doc was just your nickname.

237
00:22:07.804 --> 00:22:11.001
No, that man's a genius. He's on the verge
of a scientific breakthrough.


238
00:22:11.107 --> 00:22:13.575
Wow. Who knew?

239
00:22:15.512 --> 00:22:19.380
I'm not on the verge of anything, kid.
This is a theory, not a therapy.


240
00:22:19.482 --> 00:22:21.473
I'm just an academic.

241
00:22:21.584 --> 00:22:24.917
- You got any idea how shitty my funding is?
- No.


242
00:22:25.989 --> 00:22:28.389
University of Nebraska
pays their football coach


243
00:22:28.491 --> 00:22:31.483
more money in a year
than my entire science budget.


244
00:22:31.594 --> 00:22:34.222
Nobody's paying attention to this work.

245
00:22:34.330 --> 00:22:36.525
Half my grants don't get approved.

246
00:22:36.633 --> 00:22:40.967
I don't have the money to make my theory
into a useable medicine.


247
00:22:42.105 --> 00:22:44.005
How old are your kids?

248
00:22:45.008 --> 00:22:46.600
Six and eight.

249
00:22:53.116 --> 00:22:57.519
Look, do yourself a favor.
Go home and spend time with your kids.


250
00:22:59.856 --> 00:23:02.620
Enjoy 'em while they're still here.

251
00:23:09.799 --> 00:23:11.926
- How much?
- How much what?


252
00:23:12.802 --> 00:23:15.862
How much money would it take
to prove your theory,


253
00:23:15.972 --> 00:23:19.430
to create your version of the medicine?

254
00:23:20.343 --> 00:23:23.710
I'd need half a million bucks
just to fund the lab work.


255
00:23:23.813 --> 00:23:26.805
- That's why you need me.
- I need you? Why?


256
00:23:26.916 --> 00:23:31.683
Because I'm the founder of
the Pompe Foundation for Children.


257
00:23:33.890 --> 00:23:36.552
I've been working on this disease
for 10 years.


258
00:23:36.659 --> 00:23:39.287
I have never heard of you guys.

259
00:23:39.395 --> 00:23:43.855
That's because we're relatively new.
We're just in the gearing-up phase.


260
00:23:44.767 --> 00:23:48.601
- How soon do you need a grant?
- Now would be good.


261
00:23:48.705 --> 00:23:53.039
Well, not all the money's in place,
but it will be, and soon.


262
00:23:55.845 --> 00:23:58.143
This is a very exciting time.

263
00:24:08.091 --> 00:24:10.992
- Thanks.
- Thank you, sir. Have a good day.


264
00:24:24.908 --> 00:24:26.102
Hey.

265
00:24:29.979 --> 00:24:31.378
You okay?

266
00:24:36.619 --> 00:24:39.611
- Did you get my messages?
- Your messages?


267
00:24:41.257 --> 00:24:43.157
You suddenly walk out of the meeting

268
00:24:43.259 --> 00:24:45.853
and fly to Nebraska
without talking to me about it,


269
00:24:45.962 --> 00:24:48.123
and you think messages make it okay?

270
00:24:48.231 --> 00:24:50.290
- I'm sorry.
- My God, John.


271
00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:53.391
I wanna find a miracle
as much as you do, okay?


272
00:24:53.503 --> 00:24:55.801
But how could you
put your job in jeopardy?

273
00:24:55.905 --> 00:24:57.372
- Aileen.
- How exactly


274
00:24:57.473 --> 00:25:00.840
do we pay $40,000 a month in healthcare
if you lose your insurance?


275
00:25:00.944 --> 00:25:02.411
Honey, come on.
Look, I'm not gonna lose my job.


276
00:25:02.512 --> 00:25:03.570
Oh, really?

277
00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:07.309
Pete called here twice last night
to ask if you were okay.


278
00:25:07.417 --> 00:25:09.214
You know, mentally.

279
00:25:16.526 --> 00:25:20.121
I'll just...
I'll call, and I'll smooth that one over.


280
00:25:20.463 --> 00:25:21.987
Yeah, no shit.

281
00:25:27.003 --> 00:25:28.436
I'm sorry.

282
00:25:32.809 --> 00:25:35.607
Something in me just kind of snapped.

283
00:25:36.646 --> 00:25:40.980
That night at the hospital,
when we thought that we were losing her,


284
00:25:46.689 --> 00:25:50.489
I prayed that if it was her time,

285
00:25:52.795 --> 00:25:57.459
she'd go quickly, without so much suffering.

286
00:26:01.137 --> 00:26:05.437
But morning came, and she pulled through.

287
00:26:07.677 --> 00:26:09.167
Her eyes,

288
00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:14.006
so determined, so defiant.

289
00:26:15.251 --> 00:26:17.014
The fight in her.

290
00:26:28.164 --> 00:26:30.962
Was he worth it? 
This Stonehill guy?

291
00:26:31.067 --> 00:26:34.730
He's really eccentric, but his science
is way ahead of everybody else's.


292
00:26:34.837 --> 00:26:38.967
- He's definitely the one to put our money on.
- Lf we had any.


293
00:26:39.075 --> 00:26:41.305
I promised him that we'd raise some,

294
00:26:41.411 --> 00:26:43.606
because he's got this conference up here
next month,


295
00:26:43.713 --> 00:26:46.079
and I said I'd have
a check ready for him.

296
00:26:46.182 --> 00:26:47.342
- How much?
- Five hundred.


297
00:26:47.450 --> 00:26:49.509
- That's all?
- Thousand.


298
00:26:51.254 --> 00:26:53.313
Is it $500 or $1,000?

299
00:26:53.589 --> 00:26:55.853
$500,000.

300
00:26:56.926 --> 00:26:58.484
By next month.

301
00:27:04.133 --> 00:27:08.399
- Sweetheart, are you totally insane?
- Apparently.


302
00:27:09.305 --> 00:27:12.035
We're holding our first fundraiser
on the 23rd at the school,


303
00:27:12.141 --> 00:27:14.507
and we would love
if you and Frank could join us.


304
00:27:14.610 --> 00:27:16.305
- Ready for your spelling test?
- I'm gonna nail it.


305
00:27:16.412 --> 00:27:17.470
Okay. Good luck.

306
00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:19.775
My name's John Crowley.
I'm calling from Oregon,


307
00:27:19.882 --> 00:27:24.342
and I got your name from
the Atlanta-area Pompe parents<i>'</i> group.


308
00:27:24.454 --> 00:27:25.478
Yeah.

309
00:27:25.588 --> 00:27:27.783
And I was so sorry
not to see you at the reunion


310
00:27:27.890 --> 00:27:32.020
because you were one of
my most favorite people in high school.


311
00:27:32.895 --> 00:27:36.387
Anyway, John and I
are starting this foundation.


312
00:27:36.499 --> 00:27:38.228
- Hey, Dad? Dad.
- No, you know what I mean.


313
00:27:38.334 --> 00:27:39.392
Just make it right.

314
00:27:39.502 --> 00:27:42.494
- Dad?
- Can't you see I'm on the phone?


315
00:27:42.605 --> 00:27:44.869
- Okay, well, tell me what he told you.
- Dad!


316
00:27:44.974 --> 00:27:47.534
No, I'm gonna have to call you back.
I can't talk. All right, bye.


317
00:27:47.643 --> 00:27:49.543
- Yeah, what is it?
- I sold my RipStik.


318
00:27:49.645 --> 00:27:50.634
Okay.

319
00:27:51.147 --> 00:27:54.810
Is it enough to give to
Megan and Patrick's foundation?


320
00:27:57.487 --> 00:27:59.751
Yeah, it's more than enough.

321
00:28:02.024 --> 00:28:03.924
- Are you John?
- Yes.


322
00:28:04.026 --> 00:28:07.484
- Marcus Temple. We spoke on the phone.
- Right. Absolutely. Good to see you.


323
00:28:07.597 --> 00:28:10.191
- All the way in from Atlanta.
- Yes.


324
00:28:10.299 --> 00:28:15.396
Well, this is for your foundation,
from my relatives, friends and church group.


325
00:28:16.639 --> 00:28:18.106
My goodness.

326
00:28:18.541 --> 00:28:20.338
Thank you very much.

327
00:28:25.515 --> 00:28:26.812
Thanks.

328
00:28:46.135 --> 00:28:51.232
- Hi, Dr. Stonehill. I'm Megan.
- Hi, Megan. I'm Dr. Stonehill.


329
00:28:51.340 --> 00:28:54.434
Yeah, that's why I said, "Hi, Dr. Stonehill."

330
00:28:55.178 --> 00:28:58.705
- Are you coming in or not?
- Yeah, thanks.


331
00:29:00.850 --> 00:29:02.442
Where's Mom and Dad?

332
00:29:02.552 --> 00:29:03.814
They'll be down in a minute.

333
00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:07.481
Patrick's vent alarm is going off,
so they need to fix it.


334
00:29:07.590 --> 00:29:10.388
His alarm goes off even more than mine.

335
00:29:18.601 --> 00:29:21.934
So, what's your deal? You married?

336
00:29:23.172 --> 00:29:24.833
Do you have a wife?

337
00:29:25.341 --> 00:29:27.172
Ex-wives. Two of 'em.

338
00:29:27.276 --> 00:29:30.905
- Yeah? How come?
- 'Cause I'm so easy to get along with.


339
00:29:31.781 --> 00:29:35.182
- Any other questions?
- No. Your turn to ask one.


340
00:29:37.687 --> 00:29:39.177
You're probably wondering
what grade I'm in.


341
00:29:39.288 --> 00:29:41.756
- What grade are you in?
- I'm in third.


342
00:29:41.891 --> 00:29:45.588
My hobbies are video games and penguins.
How about you?


343
00:29:46.362 --> 00:29:49.854
- I already graduated.
- No, I mean hobbies.


344
00:29:52.635 --> 00:29:53.761
Mostly I just work.

345
00:29:53.870 --> 00:29:57.169
Little bass fishing
every once in a while, but...


346
00:29:59.542 --> 00:30:00.941
What's your favorite subject?

347
00:30:01.043 --> 00:30:05.377
I'm good at reading, but I like P.E. Best,
especially the sprint races.


348
00:30:05.481 --> 00:30:06.709
Sprint races?

349
00:30:06.816 --> 00:30:09.011
- Wanna see?
- Sure.


350
00:30:14.490 --> 00:30:15.889
Come on.

351
00:30:18.561 --> 00:30:20.859
- Is he here yet?
- I don't know.


352
00:30:29.839 --> 00:30:31.773
I'm gonna win!

353
00:30:32.475 --> 00:30:34.375
Come on, slowpoke.

354
00:30:38.748 --> 00:30:40.443
Yeah, I won!

355
00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:42.715
I won.

356
00:30:43.152 --> 00:30:44.551
Oh, yeah.

357
00:30:45.187 --> 00:30:47.417
Told you I'm gonna beat you.

358
00:30:48.457 --> 00:30:49.719
Hi.

359
00:30:50.993 --> 00:30:53.587
Dr. Stonehill has two ex-wives.

360
00:30:53.696 --> 00:30:55.994
- I see that Megan's introduced herself.
- Yeah.


361
00:30:56.098 --> 00:30:58.089
- How are you, Dr. Stonehill?
- I'm okay, thank you.


362
00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:00.134
- This is Aileen, my wife.
- So nice to meet you.


363
00:31:00.269 --> 00:31:02.396
- And John Jr.
- Hello.


364
00:31:02.505 --> 00:31:03.767
- Here's Patrick.
- Hi.


365
00:31:03.873 --> 00:31:06.637
- Hey, Patrick.
- I think we should probably go inside.


366
00:31:06.909 --> 00:31:08.069
Yeah, come on inside.

367
00:31:08.177 --> 00:31:11.078
Megan, we'll see you inside. Come on.

368
00:31:16.552 --> 00:31:18.816
- Night, Patrick.
- Good night.


369
00:31:19.455 --> 00:31:20.683
Night, SpongeBob.

370
00:31:20.790 --> 00:31:24.157
- You gotta say good night to Dr. Stonehill.
- Kiss SpongeBob.


371
00:31:31.033 --> 00:31:32.967
- Good night.
- Good night, son.


372
00:31:34.570 --> 00:31:36.265
Good night, Patrick.

373
00:31:36.372 --> 00:31:39.535
I'm not gonna say it again. 
It is bedtime now.

374
00:31:40.009 --> 00:31:41.670
It's for him.

375
00:31:44.013 --> 00:31:47.847
- Me?
- For good luck. For bass fishing.


376
00:31:48.884 --> 00:31:50.112
Thank you.

377
00:31:52.655 --> 00:31:54.384
You like it?

378
00:31:54.523 --> 00:31:58.983
Well, sure. A happy-go-lucky little fellow,
lots of personality, huh?


379
00:31:59.929 --> 00:32:02.864
- He's a plastic toy.
- I know.


380
00:32:03.332 --> 00:32:04.799
Here's the father-daughter dance.

381
00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:08.301
You haven't lived until you've seen
Megan do the Wheelchair Watusi.


382
00:32:08.404 --> 00:32:09.894
Here you go.

383
00:32:10.006 --> 00:32:13.908
- Go ahead and eat the cobbler while it's hot.
- Smells great, honey.


384
00:32:15.111 --> 00:32:16.578
This was hilarious.

385
00:32:16.679 --> 00:32:20.342
Bob, we went to this dude ranch.
All right if I call you Bob?


386
00:32:20.449 --> 00:32:25.386
You got a check for a half-million dollars,
hell, you can call me Peggy Sue.


387
00:32:28.357 --> 00:32:29.881
I'll just...

388
00:32:40.503 --> 00:32:42.027
Well, Bob.

389
00:32:42.672 --> 00:32:47.302
This is the first installment
against the promised half a million.


390
00:32:58.721 --> 00:33:01.417
Tell you the truth,
that's more than I expected.


391
00:33:01.524 --> 00:33:04.618
Dr. Stonehill, we promise that...

392
00:33:04.727 --> 00:33:06.524
- Yeah, I know.
- Lf... In enough time, then...


393
00:33:06.629 --> 00:33:08.597
I know. I know.

394
00:33:10.199 --> 00:33:13.532
You can learn a lot about a person
on the Internet these days.


395
00:33:13.636 --> 00:33:17.128
Learn about a working-class kid
from New Jersey,


396
00:33:17.239 --> 00:33:20.208
worked his way through
Harvard Business School,


397
00:33:20.309 --> 00:33:22.777
clawing his way up the ladder
at Bristol-Myers.


398
00:33:22.912 --> 00:33:24.379
But what Google can't tell you

399
00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:26.948
is that this scared, desperate, bullshitting
son of a bitch...


400
00:33:27.049 --> 00:33:28.812
- Wait just a minute...
- Don't interrupt.


401
00:33:28.918 --> 00:33:32.251
Will do and say whatever it takes
to get results.


402
00:33:33.422 --> 00:33:36.858
Which is why you and me are going
into business together, Jersey.


403
00:33:36.959 --> 00:33:38.119
Excuse me?

404
00:33:38.227 --> 00:33:40.491
I'm tired of begging breadcrumbs
from the university


405
00:33:40.596 --> 00:33:43.156
and giving them the patents to my ideas.

406
00:33:43.265 --> 00:33:46.063
They don't value my work. You do,

407
00:33:46.836 --> 00:33:49.498
which is why I'm
setting up my own shop.

408
00:33:49.605 --> 00:33:50.970
Figure any dude in a business suit

409
00:33:51.073 --> 00:33:53.200
can help me raise venture capital
and run the company,


410
00:33:53.309 --> 00:33:57.871
but who's gonna be half as motivated as
a dad who's trying to save his own kids?


411
00:33:57.980 --> 00:33:59.811
So, this is...

412
00:33:59.915 --> 00:34:02.383
So this is the shittiest offer
you're ever gonna get.


413
00:34:02.485 --> 00:34:06.478
I can promise you less money, longer hours,
lousy working conditions,


414
00:34:06.589 --> 00:34:10.548
plus, if we raise the money,
you're gonna have to relocate to Nebraska.


415
00:34:15.197 --> 00:34:16.721
And with the right business plan,

416
00:34:16.832 --> 00:34:20.768
I can also promise you
a working enzyme for Pompe disease.


417
00:34:21.537 --> 00:34:25.405
I can't cure your kids, you know that.
They're always gonna be in wheelchairs,


418
00:34:26.776 --> 00:34:29.438
but I think I can save their lives.

419
00:34:34.416 --> 00:34:36.281
Outstanding cobbler.

420
00:34:39.021 --> 00:34:43.685
Okay, okay.
So, we agree we can't uproot the kids.


421
00:34:44.527 --> 00:34:46.654
What if Stonehill fails?

422
00:34:50.199 --> 00:34:54.101
Or what if he succeeds too late
to help Megs and Patrick?


423
00:34:54.203 --> 00:34:56.535
- Then what?
- I know.


424
00:34:57.673 --> 00:35:02.337
If we're gonna lose them young, you want
to spend every minute you can with them.


425
00:35:09.552 --> 00:35:13.249
John, that day that you flew to Nebraska,

426
00:35:13.355 --> 00:35:16.882
when you suddenly just ditched work and...

427
00:35:19.361 --> 00:35:22.853
My God, I thought you'd lost it.
You scared me.


428
00:35:23.599 --> 00:35:26.159
But once we rolled our sleeves up,

429
00:35:26.268 --> 00:35:30.500
and we started fundraising
and meeting other Pompe families,


430
00:35:33.409 --> 00:35:35.377
it made me feel like...

431
00:35:35.811 --> 00:35:38.041
I mean, do we just accept our fate

432
00:35:38.147 --> 00:35:41.742
and do what we're told
by all the well-meaning doctors


433
00:35:43.052 --> 00:35:46.886
and wait for the worst to happen,
or do we fight it?


434
00:35:49.625 --> 00:35:53.391
<i>I think you're making a mistake. 
I really do.</i>

435
00:35:53.996 --> 00:35:58.092
Even if you were credible as a CEO,
which you are not,


436
00:35:59.468 --> 00:36:04.371
the odds against you are crushing.
Nine out of 10 biotechs crash and burn.


437
00:36:04.473 --> 00:36:08.705
So where does that leave your kids
when their dad is flat broke


438
00:36:09.345 --> 00:36:12.872
with no job and no health insurance?

439
00:36:13.182 --> 00:36:14.240
Now, if you stay at Bristol,

440
00:36:14.350 --> 00:36:18.582
the guys upstairs are ready to put you in
the VP slot at the end of the third quarter


441
00:36:18.687 --> 00:36:20.882
with a 40% salary bump.

442
00:36:21.690 --> 00:36:22.884
John.

443
00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:27.524
Your family's gonna need that money,
aren't they?


444
00:36:27.630 --> 00:36:30.360
Pete, you're right. 
This is crazy.

445
00:36:31.734 --> 00:36:33.634
I'm chasing the wind.

446
00:36:34.904 --> 00:36:36.872
But I can't just

447
00:36:38.908 --> 00:36:42.071
sit around and wait
for my kids to die.

448
00:36:43.946 --> 00:36:45.538
I can't do it.

449
00:37:08.103 --> 00:37:11.072
<i>You have arrived at your destination.</i>

450
00:37:25.955 --> 00:37:28.150
Come on in. It's open.

451
00:37:28.791 --> 00:37:30.452
- Hey, there, Bob.
- Hey, John.


452
00:37:30.559 --> 00:37:31.583
How are you?

453
00:37:31.694 --> 00:37:33.958
- You have trouble finding me?
- No problem.


454
00:37:34.063 --> 00:37:35.826
- Sit down.
- Thanks.


455
00:37:42.638 --> 00:37:45.539
Ex-wife. She loved cats.

456
00:37:49.345 --> 00:37:52.007
Well, say, what do we...

457
00:37:53.916 --> 00:37:57.613
What are we gonna do?
How about we work up a strategy


458
00:37:57.720 --> 00:38:00.518
for the meeting at Renzler next week?

459
00:38:03.225 --> 00:38:05.659
We don't need to show those guys anything.

460
00:38:06.095 --> 00:38:07.494
The meeting's a formality.

461
00:38:07.596 --> 00:38:10.156
George Renzler and I have known each other
since med school.


462
00:38:10.265 --> 00:38:15.100
He's been telling me for years that
he'd give me the seed money


463
00:38:15.204 --> 00:38:18.640
if I ever decide to make the big move
and set up my own shop.


464
00:38:18.741 --> 00:38:21.301
Well, that's good. That's good,
but, still, all the same, you know,


465
00:38:21.410 --> 00:38:23.970
if we're gonna go in to pitch 'em,
we should have something tangible.


466
00:38:24.079 --> 00:38:28.243
Those guys understand me.
They're real scientists.


467
00:38:29.118 --> 00:38:32.485
They're not like a lot of
these big biotech moneymen.


468
00:38:32.588 --> 00:38:36.456
Okay. All right, tell you what,
how about if we just talk it through,


469
00:38:36.558 --> 00:38:39.322
and then that way we can just sketch up
something rough on paper?


470
00:38:39.428 --> 00:38:42.727
You give it to me,
I'll make up a business plan.


471
00:38:49.772 --> 00:38:54.471
We need to rough out a real strategy.
These guys are venture capitalists.


472
00:38:54.576 --> 00:38:56.737
That rough enough for you?

473
00:38:58.614 --> 00:39:01.845
Bob? Look, Renzler's crucial to us. Without
them onboard, we got zero credibility


474
00:39:01.950 --> 00:39:03.850
- with any of our investors.
- That's why you're here, Jersey!


475
00:39:03.952 --> 00:39:06.216
Whip up some business bullshit
by tomorrow.


476
00:39:06.321 --> 00:39:10.052
- I'm going fishing.
- This is... This is gibberish!


477
00:39:10.159 --> 00:39:12.059
Then you better get busy.

478
00:39:12.161 --> 00:39:13.560
See you.

479
00:39:32.681 --> 00:39:37.311
As you know, the market potential
for an orphan drug is enormous.


480
00:39:37.419 --> 00:39:40.047
If you were still in business school,
I'd give you an A


481
00:39:40.155 --> 00:39:44.421
for all these lovely charts and graphs and...

482
00:39:44.927 --> 00:39:46.758
But school is out.

483
00:39:46.862 --> 00:39:50.764
Most of us here are scientists.
We need to see the science.


484
00:39:51.266 --> 00:39:54.099
Bob, make us believe.

485
00:39:56.872 --> 00:39:58.635
Love to, George.

486
00:40:12.855 --> 00:40:17.622
...the phosphotransferase
and the second uncovering enzyme...


487
00:40:23.065 --> 00:40:25.898
At this point, the challenge
is to scale up this process


488
00:40:26.001 --> 00:40:28.663
to produce kilogram quantities of HPGAA.

489
00:40:28.804 --> 00:40:30.863
And the question is
whether or not it's cost-effective


490
00:40:31.006 --> 00:40:35.443
to contract this work out
or to build our own manufacturing facility.


491
00:40:35.544 --> 00:40:40.709
Either way, we're gonna eventually need
an investment on the order of $10 million.


492
00:40:41.316 --> 00:40:44.444
It's a lot of information
in a short period of time.


493
00:40:44.553 --> 00:40:46.248
Does anybody have any questions?

494
00:40:46.355 --> 00:40:48.323
- This is astonishing.
- Well, thank you, George.


495
00:40:48.423 --> 00:40:51.324
This man is light
years ahead of the field.

496
00:40:51.660 --> 00:40:52.957
Okay.

497
00:40:53.061 --> 00:40:55.723
Well, why don't you have your money guys
get together with John


498
00:40:55.831 --> 00:40:58.561
- and work out the business...
- Sounds great.


499
00:40:58.667 --> 00:41:02.728
Of course, we'll need you to explain
some of the mundane stuff, Bob,


500
00:41:02.838 --> 00:41:04.669
the nuts and bolts.

501
00:41:05.407 --> 00:41:07.307
- Nuts and bolts? What...
- Yeah.


502
00:41:07.409 --> 00:41:08.933
You're a brilliant theoretician,

503
00:41:09.044 --> 00:41:13.037
but you've never actually brought
a new drug to market before, right?


504
00:41:13.182 --> 00:41:15.582
No, I've never brought a drug to market.
I haven't.


505
00:41:15.684 --> 00:41:20.519
I mean, for example, how are you getting
the phosphotransferase?


506
00:41:20.856 --> 00:41:24.314
I'm purifying it
out of a lactating bovine udder.


507
00:41:25.227 --> 00:41:28.253
I see. And where
are you getting the udders?

508
00:41:29.965 --> 00:41:31.956
From the stockyards.

509
00:41:32.067 --> 00:41:34.695
- Pretty straightforward stuff.
- Not really.


510
00:41:34.803 --> 00:41:38.534
- You can't inject cow protein into people.
- I know that.


511
00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:42.303
The bovine version of the enzyme
is for lab work, for proof of concept.


512
00:41:42.411 --> 00:41:46.006
I'll make a copy of the human enzyme
for actual drug trials.


513
00:41:46.114 --> 00:41:48.378
- What about uncovering enzyme?
- What about it?


514
00:41:48.483 --> 00:41:49.711
How exactly do you plan on making

515
00:41:49.818 --> 00:41:52.013
- an exact replica?
- I'm making it in T-293,


516
00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:53.644
out of human kidney cells.

517
00:41:53.755 --> 00:41:56.849
- Oh, my goodness. No.
- "Oh, my goodness. No?"


518
00:41:56.959 --> 00:41:58.620
No. The FDA will never allow that.

519
00:41:58.727 --> 00:42:01.594
- Hey, Bob, just...
- Wait a second.


520
00:42:01.730 --> 00:42:06.360
For Christ's sake, we will change
the cell line before clinical trials.


521
00:42:06.468 --> 00:42:09.369
You've gotta have that process locked down
long, long before you think about...


522
00:42:09.471 --> 00:42:11.063
Bob, why don't we
just take a coffee break...

523
00:42:11.173 --> 00:42:13.664
Why are you talking to me this way?
I don't want any goddamn coffee.


524
00:42:13.775 --> 00:42:16.005
Bob, can you just tell us
how you're planning to make


525
00:42:16.111 --> 00:42:19.911
the three enzymes
under FDA-approved GMP in...


526
00:42:20.015 --> 00:42:23.178
I'm not here to cross every "t"
and dot every "i", George.


527
00:42:23.285 --> 00:42:27.381
And I'm not here to be poked and prodded
like a first-year med student.


528
00:42:27.489 --> 00:42:29.821
- This is ridiculous.
- Bob.


529
00:42:31.159 --> 00:42:32.888
This is bullshit.

530
00:42:39.167 --> 00:42:40.191
Bob.

531
00:42:46.208 --> 00:42:50.440
Bob, if you can't answer a question,
you say you're working out the details.


532
00:42:50.545 --> 00:42:53.981
You don't storm out on these guys
like some sort of spoiled child, okay?


533
00:42:54.082 --> 00:42:56.607
- Now, we're gonna go back in there.
- No, I'm not going back in there.


534
00:42:56.718 --> 00:43:00.347
We're going back in there.
This is business, Bob. It's not personal.


535
00:43:00.489 --> 00:43:02.514
That was personal.

536
00:43:09.731 --> 00:43:12.632
Stonehill goes and completely sabotages
the meeting.


537
00:43:12.734 --> 00:43:13.792
Thank you.

538
00:43:13.902 --> 00:43:16.666
I mean, he completely blew my plan,
right out of the gate.


539
00:43:16.772 --> 00:43:20.173
Okay, I get that he's a loose cannon,
but do you still believe in his science?


540
00:43:20.275 --> 00:43:25.110
Honey, if I don't
raise $10 million in capital,

541
00:43:25.213 --> 00:43:28.376
his science doesn't matter. At all.

542
00:43:32.921 --> 00:43:35.355
What's going on with his arm?

543
00:43:36.458 --> 00:43:38.426
Hey, buddy, you okay?

544
00:43:42.531 --> 00:43:45.557
- You all right?
- I can't throw them anymore.


545
00:43:46.601 --> 00:43:49.229
- When did this happen?
- I don't know.


546
00:43:50.305 --> 00:43:53.433
- You should help him, Daddy.
- That's a good idea.


547
00:43:53.542 --> 00:43:55.442
Okay, here we go. You ready?

548
00:43:55.544 --> 00:43:58.843
- One, two...
- Into the water.


549
00:43:59.981 --> 00:44:02.609
That was a good shot.
We can do better than that.


550
00:44:02.718 --> 00:44:06.620
Try again.
Let's make, like, a little pellet.


551
00:44:07.289 --> 00:44:09.052
Here, ducky, ducky.

552
00:44:14.763 --> 00:44:16.390
Let's do it again.

553
00:44:16.932 --> 00:44:18.923
Ready? One, two, three.

554
00:44:19.501 --> 00:44:21.230
Give me another piece, John.

555
00:44:22.471 --> 00:44:24.462
I can just throw them.

556
00:44:26.408 --> 00:44:29.809
And you do all the laughing,
and I'll do all the throwing.


557
00:44:30.512 --> 00:44:31.706
That's good, the ducky shared.

558
00:44:31.813 --> 00:44:33.610
- Did you see that?
- Yeah.


559
00:44:41.089 --> 00:44:42.249
John?

560
00:44:45.327 --> 00:44:47.818
- We're out of time.
- I know.


561
00:44:50.132 --> 00:44:54.398
He doesn't have the strength
to throw a piece of bread to a duck.


562
00:44:57.839 --> 00:45:00.740
- It scares the hell out of me.
- Me, too.


563
00:45:03.044 --> 00:45:05.808
John, what are you doing?

564
00:45:06.314 --> 00:45:09.613
I'm offering Renzler a deal
he can't turn down.


565
00:45:34.876 --> 00:45:37.367
Excuse me. Morning. Dr. Renzler?

566
00:45:38.079 --> 00:45:39.637
Dr. Renzler?

567
00:45:40.248 --> 00:45:42.045
Sir, good morning.

568
00:45:42.517 --> 00:45:43.643
- John Crowley.
- Crowley?


569
00:45:43.752 --> 00:45:44.878
- Yes, sir.
- What are you doing here?


570
00:45:44.986 --> 00:45:45.975
- Good morning.
- Good morning.


571
00:45:46.087 --> 00:45:49.147
I understand from your secretary that
you're going to be leaving for France


572
00:45:49.257 --> 00:45:50.451
- for a month.
- That's right.


573
00:45:50.559 --> 00:45:52.049
I have a proposal for you,
and I was hopeful


574
00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:54.560
- that you could take a look at it.
- We're running late for a flight.


575
00:45:54.663 --> 00:45:58.121
I appreciate that. It'll only take a second,
just to have a quick read.


576
00:45:58.233 --> 00:46:00.394
- Fine. I'll read it in the car.
- It might interest you.


577
00:46:00.502 --> 00:46:01.901
Good, thank you.

578
00:46:17.185 --> 00:46:20.177
- Does Stonehill know about this?
- Of course.


579
00:46:20.856 --> 00:46:23.825
And he's okay with these terms?

580
00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:27.326
All I need is your signature.

581
00:46:52.988 --> 00:46:54.182
Hello?

582
00:47:01.997 --> 00:47:03.089
Bob.

583
00:47:06.301 --> 00:47:07.529
Bob.

584
00:47:09.437 --> 00:47:10.563
Bob!

585
00:47:11.673 --> 00:47:13.106
Over here.

586
00:47:14.309 --> 00:47:15.435
Bob.

587
00:47:20.081 --> 00:47:21.207
Bob!

588
00:47:22.918 --> 00:47:24.476
Hi. Bob.

589
00:47:34.429 --> 00:47:36.021
What'd you do to yourself?

590
00:47:36.131 --> 00:47:39.931
- I got the investment from Renzler.
- You what?


591
00:47:40.035 --> 00:47:42.094
Listen, I want you to

592
00:47:43.939 --> 00:47:45.406
think about something before you read that.

593
00:47:45.507 --> 00:47:46.565
What the hell is this?

594
00:47:46.675 --> 00:47:51.112
Under the circumstances,
this is the best deal that we could ever get.


595
00:47:51.646 --> 00:47:55.946
This isn't a deal.
This is the terms of our surrender, for...


596
00:47:56.051 --> 00:47:58.212
Renzler comes in
for a couple of million now,


597
00:47:58.320 --> 00:48:01.414
and you give him the option
of jumping in as a full partner later?


598
00:48:01.523 --> 00:48:04.583
Well, after sabotaging our meeting,
I had to do something dramatic.


599
00:48:04.693 --> 00:48:08.151
And you promise him
we'll be in clinical trials in a year?


600
00:48:08.296 --> 00:48:10.355
We can do this, Bob. All right?

601
00:48:10.498 --> 00:48:12.489
We work harder, we push ourselves,
we work around the clock.


602
00:48:12.634 --> 00:48:14.898
I already work around the clock!

603
00:48:15.003 --> 00:48:17.767
Why don't you just give 'em
my balls in a jelly jar?


604
00:48:17.872 --> 00:48:20.272
There's no other way I could get them
to come back to the table.


605
00:48:20.375 --> 00:48:22.639
Who needs the bastards anyway!

606
00:48:22.744 --> 00:48:27.408
Without Renzler, there's no reason for us
to even think about other venture groups.


607
00:48:27.515 --> 00:48:30.382
Fine! Then I won't think
about other venture groups!


608
00:48:30.485 --> 00:48:31.884
Great!

609
00:48:31.987 --> 00:48:37.084
Spend the rest of your life dreaming up
great ideas that don't get funded.


610
00:48:37.192 --> 00:48:41.458
Draw brilliant diagrams on the wall
that cure diseases in theory,


611
00:48:42.030 --> 00:48:45.295
but never help a single human being
in reality.


612
00:49:20.602 --> 00:49:22.570
What'd you do? 
Let me see it.

613
00:49:22.704 --> 00:49:25.195
- It's just barely...
- Let me see.


614
00:49:30.478 --> 00:49:32.343
Put pressure on it.

615
00:49:39.554 --> 00:49:41.681
Got your blood all over this thing.

616
00:49:41.790 --> 00:49:45.055
Want me to add a drop of mine,
make it official?


617
00:49:47.996 --> 00:49:50.396
Or would a signature suffice?

618
00:50:04.679 --> 00:50:05.771
Bob?

619
00:50:50.024 --> 00:50:53.892
I'm not paying a dollar more
than 22,000 a unit, okay?


620
00:50:53.995 --> 00:50:54.984
I'm not doing it.

621
00:50:57.699 --> 00:50:58.927
Hi, Bob.

622
00:51:04.506 --> 00:51:06.940
These guys make me feel old.

623
00:51:07.976 --> 00:51:11.810
Scientists get all sensible and careful
when they get old.


624
00:51:11.913 --> 00:51:14.245
Young ones like risk,

625
00:51:14.349 --> 00:51:16.544
not afraid of new ideas,

626
00:51:19.554 --> 00:51:21.784
and you can pay 'em less.

627
00:51:24.392 --> 00:51:29.295
We all believe in Bob Stonehill's
bold vision, otherwise you wouldn't be here.


628
00:51:29.397 --> 00:51:32.628
But to reach clinical
trials inside of a year,

629
00:51:33.334 --> 00:51:38.169
I'm gonna have to ask you
to commit to a brutal schedule.


630
00:51:38.273 --> 00:51:43.734
Ladies and gentlemen,
reset your watches to Priozyme Time.


631
00:51:47.882 --> 00:51:50.510
- How long?
- Three, four hours.


632
00:51:55.290 --> 00:51:58.225
Well, if you can get it any quicker,
that'd be good.


633
00:51:58.359 --> 00:51:59.883
I'll try.

634
00:52:07.902 --> 00:52:09.199
Come on.

635
00:52:09.871 --> 00:52:12.499
- Vinh, check the breakers.
- Got it.


636
00:52:16.411 --> 00:52:20.871
- No, the whole building's out.
- Well, get the backup generator going.


637
00:52:21.416 --> 00:52:23.941
- We...
- Wait, wait, wait.


638
00:52:24.052 --> 00:52:26.680
You never bothered
to buy a backup generator?


639
00:52:26.788 --> 00:52:28.449
We're in the middle of tornado country,

640
00:52:28.556 --> 00:52:30.285
- for Christ's sake!
- Yeah, so I'm a meteorologist?


641
00:52:30.391 --> 00:52:35.124
If I don't have my refrigeration back
in 45 minutes, I lose the whole cell line.


642
00:52:35.263 --> 00:52:37.561
Four months of work pissed away!

643
00:52:37.665 --> 00:52:40.600
It was never in the budget.
We never had the money for it.


644
00:52:42.103 --> 00:52:45.561
- I'm sorry, sir. Your card, it's been denied.
- What?


645
00:52:46.474 --> 00:52:50.467
It got maxed out.
I bought the roller bottle unit for the lab.


646
00:52:50.578 --> 00:52:52.136
Shit, I...

647
00:52:54.816 --> 00:52:59.014
Just pay me back by the end of the month,
or I lose my apartment.


648
00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:01.281
Hi, here you go. Thanks.

649
00:53:04.425 --> 00:53:05.653
Yes!

650
00:53:08.596 --> 00:53:09.756
Yes!

651
00:53:13.501 --> 00:53:14.763
Sir.

652
00:53:17.105 --> 00:53:18.504
Thank you.

653
00:53:30.518 --> 00:53:34.284
Fiona's in Mexico this week.
They've got pyramids there.


654
00:53:35.890 --> 00:53:39.724
She's still got lots of things to see
before she gets to Antarctica.


655
00:53:39.827 --> 00:53:41.124
Yeah.

656
00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:49.436
She's gonna chop up
all the penguins with an ax.


657
00:53:49.537 --> 00:53:52.995
And feed their bloody
remains to the walruses.


658
00:53:53.308 --> 00:53:54.673
I see.

659
00:53:56.544 --> 00:53:57.568
What?

660
00:53:57.679 --> 00:54:00.739
Every time you come home for the weekend,
you don't even listen to me.


661
00:54:00.848 --> 00:54:02.179
Megs.

662
00:54:03.217 --> 00:54:05.708
You know what, you're right. I'm sorry.

663
00:54:05.820 --> 00:54:08.380
It's just that I've been so busy

664
00:54:08.489 --> 00:54:11.583
trying to make the special medicine
for you and Patrick.


665
00:54:11.693 --> 00:54:14.457
- I want it pink.
- You want what?


666
00:54:14.562 --> 00:54:17.656
The special medicine. 
I want it to be pink.

667
00:54:18.933 --> 00:54:22.232
Okay. I guess I can ask Dr. Stonehill.

668
00:54:22.337 --> 00:54:27.570
Tell him dark pink, like this.
Not light pink. That's for babies.


669
00:54:28.710 --> 00:54:29.870
Okay.

670
00:54:33.982 --> 00:54:35.074
Here you go.

671
00:54:35.183 --> 00:54:38.550
Dr. Renzler, be reasonable.
The company is only six months old,


672
00:54:38.653 --> 00:54:41.645
and we are making great progress
towards in vivo testing.


673
00:54:41.756 --> 00:54:44.520
I don't know.
The way the company is burning money...


674
00:54:44.625 --> 00:54:46.923
<i>Well, we've got to get a leg up</i>
<i>on the competition.</i>


675
00:54:47.028 --> 00:54:50.395
You know that Zymagen has
far more spending power than we do.


676
00:54:50.498 --> 00:54:52.728
So, what you're saying,
I should have invested in Zymagen.


677
00:54:52.834 --> 00:54:55.997
No, what I'm saying is,
is that we've got to beat 'em to the punch.


678
00:54:56.104 --> 00:54:58.504
Either that, or scare
them into buying us out.

679
00:54:58.639 --> 00:55:02.439
Well, you're scaring us investors a hell of
a lot more than you're scaring Zymagen.


680
00:55:02.844 --> 00:55:04.812
<i>You sell the company to Zymagen,</i>

681
00:55:05.013 --> 00:55:07.607
you're in clinical trials
by the end of the fiscal year,


682
00:55:07.715 --> 00:55:11.207
or we pull the plug and cut our losses.
Goodbye.


683
00:55:13.821 --> 00:55:15.049
Hello?

684
00:55:24.098 --> 00:55:26.896
This construct's looking pretty good,

685
00:55:27.001 --> 00:55:32.098
but we gotta get better cleavage
between the alpha and the beta subunits.


686
00:55:32.206 --> 00:55:35.073
Well, what if we add a furin site
like the one in uncovering enzyme?


687
00:55:35.176 --> 00:55:36.803
Why would you wanna do that?
Doesn't it have its own...


688
00:55:36.911 --> 00:55:38.105
We need to talk.

689
00:55:38.212 --> 00:55:39.839
- I'm busy.
- You're always busy.


690
00:55:39.947 --> 00:55:41.471
You always wanna talk.

691
00:55:41.582 --> 00:55:46.144
Yeah, we could add furin
and try and cleave it before purification.


692
00:55:48.122 --> 00:55:49.680
What are you doing?

693
00:55:49.791 --> 00:55:52.191
- Giving you a preview...
- Guys, would you excuse us for a minute?


694
00:55:52.293 --> 00:55:56.525
...of what's going to happen
if we are not in clinical trials in four months.


695
00:55:56.631 --> 00:55:59.429
Our investors will turn out the lights.

696
00:56:02.136 --> 00:56:05.003
Science takes time, Jersey.
Don't they understand?


697
00:56:05.106 --> 00:56:06.937
Yeah, they do.
They can read the <i>Wall Street Journal.</i>


698
00:56:07.041 --> 00:56:10.807
They see that Zymagen
is testing three different Pompe drugs.


699
00:56:10.912 --> 00:56:13.608
They're testing three 'cause they don't know
what the hell they're doing.


700
00:56:13.714 --> 00:56:18.117
- I'm testing one 'cause it's the right one!
- I know. I believe you, Bob.


701
00:56:18.252 --> 00:56:21.187
Why else do you think
I put up with all your shit?


702
00:56:21.289 --> 00:56:22.517
Look.

703
00:56:24.058 --> 00:56:29.462
I want you to go toe-to-toe
with Zymagen's scientists.


704
00:56:29.564 --> 00:56:33.295
- Prove to them that your enzyme is best.
- I can do that.


705
00:56:33.434 --> 00:56:35.664
That's the reason I've entered
into conversations with them


706
00:56:35.770 --> 00:56:38.068
to buy our company.

707
00:56:38.172 --> 00:56:40.504
You're telling me? 
You're not asking me?

708
00:56:40.608 --> 00:56:44.977
Come on, Bob.
I am just being fiscally responsible.


709
00:56:45.079 --> 00:56:48.742
Nobody is gonna tell me
how to run my lab!

710
00:56:48.850 --> 00:56:52.377
If I can engineer a deal,
and that is a really big "if,"


711
00:56:52.487 --> 00:56:55.012
you're going to have to forgive me
for all the money I'm gonna make you.


712
00:56:55.123 --> 00:56:57.057
I don't care about money.

713
00:56:57.158 --> 00:57:01.117
I'm a scientist.
I care about more important things than that.


714
00:57:01.629 --> 00:57:05.565
Don't you tell me about
more important things to care about.


715
00:57:06.834 --> 00:57:08.426
Do the math.

716
00:57:09.437 --> 00:57:14.739
Either we sell the company
and get a huge cash infusion,


717
00:57:16.511 --> 00:57:19.071
or the investors will shut us down.

718
00:57:29.056 --> 00:57:30.785
Where you going?

719
00:57:34.896 --> 00:57:39.333
I'm gonna go take a crap,
if that meets with your fiscal approval.


720
00:57:58.553 --> 00:58:01.750
What, they can't drive from the airport
like ordinary people?


721
00:58:01.856 --> 00:58:04.324
Bob, we need to make this happen.

722
00:58:06.327 --> 00:58:08.454
They're gonna ask us some tough questions.

723
00:58:08.896 --> 00:58:13.060
Don't take 'em personally, all right?
All right?


724
00:58:24.779 --> 00:58:28.237
These lab results confirm
what I've been preaching for years,


725
00:58:28.416 --> 00:58:32.182
that phosphorylation is key
to enzyme absorption.


726
00:58:33.054 --> 00:58:35.522
My theory works for Pompe,

727
00:58:35.623 --> 00:58:39.491
and eventually it'll work for
enzyme replacement therapies


728
00:58:39.594 --> 00:58:42.358
for other lysosomal storage disorders.

729
00:58:42.964 --> 00:58:46.092
- Is it too complicated?
- Too complicated?


730
00:58:46.200 --> 00:58:50.227
The number of variables built into
your approach are mind-boggling.


731
00:58:50.338 --> 00:58:53.671
I mean, Jesus, if you get even
one piece wrong in the synthesis,


732
00:58:53.774 --> 00:58:56.834
just one carbohydrate ends up
in the wrong position...


733
00:58:56.944 --> 00:59:00.243
Well, it's gotta be done right,
like anything worth doing.


734
00:59:00.781 --> 00:59:03.545
You've never actually gotten
a drug approved.


735
00:59:03.651 --> 00:59:08.554
Isn't it naive to think you can solve
these kinds of manufacturing challenges?


736
00:59:14.395 --> 00:59:16.522
Bob? Bob?

737
00:59:17.832 --> 00:59:20.528
You're right, I'm a theory guy.

738
00:59:21.502 --> 00:59:23.697
My head is in the clouds.

739
00:59:25.640 --> 00:59:27.767
Which is why we need you.

740
00:59:30.344 --> 00:59:32.642
Unless, of course, your reputation

741
00:59:32.780 --> 00:59:36.614
for solving protein-manufacturing problems
is undeserved.


742
00:59:38.786 --> 00:59:40.151
Nice one.

743
00:59:41.255 --> 00:59:46.090
- I still need to hear about profitability.
- Certainly, certainly.


744
00:59:46.627 --> 00:59:51.997
As you know, this is not
a one-time treatment. It's a lifelong therapy.


745
00:59:52.099 --> 00:59:53.896
And these patients,

746
00:59:54.001 --> 00:59:59.940
they are going to generate revenue
over the span of their lifetime that is...


747
01:00:00.041 --> 01:00:04.171
But even if you make a usable enzyme,
clearly it won't work for all patients.


748
01:00:04.278 --> 01:00:07.770
So, what survival rate do we need
to achieve a robust profit?


749
01:00:07.882 --> 01:00:11.841
What rate of patient death
can be defined as acceptable loss?


750
01:00:12.787 --> 01:00:14.778
Acceptable loss?

751
01:00:20.528 --> 01:00:22.655
I understand the question.

752
01:00:25.366 --> 01:00:31.305
Because the profit margins on this
orphan drug are so incredibly high, the...


753
01:00:32.673 --> 01:00:38.407
Even with a mortality rate of,
say, 25% over five years still indicates


754
01:00:38.512 --> 01:00:44.473
that there is a highly lucrative
revenue source to be realized.


755
01:00:59.567 --> 01:01:01.797
Gentlemen, we have a deal.

756
01:01:49.417 --> 01:01:52.215
Dr. Robert Stonehill to see Barry Renee.

757
01:01:55.623 --> 01:01:58.922
I have a Dr. Robert Stonehill
to see Dr. Renee.


758
01:02:01.061 --> 01:02:04.053
- Sir, you need to be cleared.
- I'm just gonna use the restroom.


759
01:02:04.165 --> 01:02:07.066
- You need to be cleared to do that, sir.
- Just need to...


760
01:02:07.168 --> 01:02:10.399
- You need a security badge.
- Jesus.


761
01:02:14.141 --> 01:02:17.702
Well, can I have a security badge
so I can go take a pee?


762
01:02:17.912 --> 01:02:19.607
Yes, sir. He will give that to you.

763
01:02:27.988 --> 01:02:30.548
- Hey, Bob.
- Hey, John.


764
01:02:30.658 --> 01:02:32.785
You getting comfortable?

765
01:02:33.661 --> 01:02:35.595
Define "comfortable."

766
01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.161
You haven't cashed it yet?

767
01:02:43.137 --> 01:02:45.128
I haven't earned it yet.

768
01:02:46.173 --> 01:02:49.165
I'll cash it when
we have a usable enzyme.

769
01:03:07.628 --> 01:03:10.222
Well, it sure is beautiful.

770
01:03:16.237 --> 01:03:18.000
It sure is big.

771
01:03:19.073 --> 01:03:20.870
The kids love it.

772
01:03:28.148 --> 01:03:29.809
Seize the day.

773
01:03:34.288 --> 01:03:35.585
Okay.

774
01:03:46.300 --> 01:03:47.790
I'm stuck on this call.

775
01:03:47.902 --> 01:03:51.065
Just wanted to let you know how thrilled
we are to have you onboard, John.


776
01:03:51.171 --> 01:03:52.798
It's an honor.

777
01:03:53.507 --> 01:03:55.634
- You remember Dr. Kent Webber.
- Of course.


778
01:03:55.743 --> 01:03:57.142
- It's good to see you again.
- Good to see you, too.


779
01:03:57.244 --> 01:04:00.111
I'll let the two
of you get into it.

780
01:04:00.214 --> 01:04:03.377
- I'm expecting great things.
- Yes, sir.


781
01:04:07.321 --> 01:04:12.156
I've got some pretty good ideas
about how to help the flow of information


782
01:04:12.259 --> 01:04:14.250
between the four core enzyme groups.

783
01:04:14.361 --> 01:04:17.762
Whoa, John, slow down.
That's not our established procedure.


784
01:04:17.865 --> 01:04:18.957
Pardon me?

785
01:04:19.066 --> 01:04:22.900
The four core teams are essentially
in competition with each other.


786
01:04:23.003 --> 01:04:25.995
It's an entrepreneurial model. It works.

787
01:04:26.106 --> 01:04:30.805
I'm all for competition,
but surely there must be some channel


788
01:04:30.911 --> 01:04:37.578
for allowing sharing scientific insights
that can help develop all four enzymes.


789
01:04:37.952 --> 01:04:42.685
John, in the interest of saving us time,
let me be blunt.


790
01:04:43.958 --> 01:04:46.153
Most of the scientists
here don't like the idea

791
01:04:46.260 --> 01:04:50.356
of having a non-scientist
as senior VP of the Pompe program.


792
01:04:51.899 --> 01:04:53.924
Especially one whose objectivity

793
01:04:54.034 --> 01:04:57.765
might be clouded
by having children with the disease.


794
01:04:58.906 --> 01:05:02.103
I'm telling you this
in your own best interests.


795
01:05:02.643 --> 01:05:05.009
Erich wanted to buy Stonehill's ideas,

796
01:05:05.112 --> 01:05:09.742
and he couldn't do that without also
swallowing you as part of the pill.


797
01:05:12.486 --> 01:05:16.582
My advice to you, John,
is to keep your head down.


798
01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:23.052
- Thank you for that wisdom.
- You're very welcome.


799
01:05:27.267 --> 01:05:28.235
All of your lab notebooks must be submitted
to the review committee!


800
01:05:28.235 --> 01:05:30.203
All of your lab notebooks must be submitted
to the review committee!


801
01:05:30.304 --> 01:05:32.795
This is my lab now! Get out!

802
01:05:32.906 --> 01:05:35.136
I'm just trying to explain the protocol!

803
01:05:35.242 --> 01:05:38.211
- You're wasting my time.
- Dr. Stonehill...


804
01:05:38.746 --> 01:05:39.974
Fine.

805
01:05:45.953 --> 01:05:47.250
What do you want?

806
01:05:47.955 --> 01:05:52.983
I just dropped by to say that I think
that we might be missing an opportunity


807
01:05:53.127 --> 01:05:55.960
to open a dialogue
with the other three core teams.


808
01:05:56.096 --> 01:05:59.657
The other core teams? Core teams.

809
01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:01.290
Core bullshit.

810
01:06:02.269 --> 01:06:04.499
I'll come back another time.

811
01:06:08.208 --> 01:06:11.336
The decline in muscle strength
is very troubling, of course,


812
01:06:11.445 --> 01:06:14.778
but it's really, in both kids,

813
01:06:14.882 --> 01:06:19.444
the organ enlargement, the liver,
and especially the heart,


814
01:06:19.553 --> 01:06:22.351
that's the real threat to their lives.

815
01:06:23.190 --> 01:06:26.387
We'll continue to monitor
the rate of cardiac enlargement.


816
01:06:26.493 --> 01:06:29.587
- We'll keep tabs on their other organs...
- How long?


817
01:06:31.231 --> 01:06:33.927
- I don't like to predict.
- Please.


818
01:06:34.034 --> 01:06:36.935
Dr. Waldman, we won't hold you to it.
We just need to know something.


819
01:06:37.037 --> 01:06:38.595
John.

820
01:06:38.906 --> 01:06:42.672
How much more time do we have?
How long?


821
01:06:44.278 --> 01:06:45.677
Well,

822
01:06:48.949 --> 01:06:52.680
if there's another respiratory crisis,
all bets are off,


823
01:06:53.353 --> 01:06:56.151
but otherwise,

824
01:06:58.859 --> 01:07:01.054
Megan, maybe a year.

825
01:07:01.695 --> 01:07:04.061
Patrick, less.

826
01:07:07.701 --> 01:07:09.100
Thank you.

827
01:07:23.984 --> 01:07:25.212
Marcus.

828
01:07:25.319 --> 01:07:26.377
- Get the phone.
- What?


829
01:07:26.487 --> 01:07:28.455
- The phone.
- Who is it?


830
01:07:29.256 --> 01:07:32.089
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Hi. Is that Marcus?


831
01:07:32.226 --> 01:07:35.218
<i>- Yeah, yeah. What time is it?</i>
- Yeah, I'm sorry. It's late.


832
01:07:35.896 --> 01:07:39.093
<i>- It's John Crowley.</i>
- John, what you doin'


833
01:07:40.434 --> 01:07:41.526
You okay?

834
01:07:43.670 --> 01:07:47.436
Hey, look, I gotta ask you a favor.

835
01:07:48.308 --> 01:07:49.900
- Morning, Gavin.
- Morning, sir.


836
01:07:50.010 --> 01:07:51.602
Is my 11:00 with Henessey confirmed?

837
01:07:51.712 --> 01:07:55.546
Yes, and there's the breakfast meeting
down in the cafeteria.


838
01:07:55.649 --> 01:07:57.048
Breakfast meeting?

839
01:07:57.151 --> 01:07:59.711
There was an e-mail that came in
over the weekend.


840
01:07:59.820 --> 01:08:01.617
Everyone on the Pompe project was invited.

841
01:08:01.755 --> 01:08:04.690
- Who called the meeting?
- Mr. Crowley, I believe, sir.


842
01:08:04.792 --> 01:08:06.089
What?

843
01:08:09.963 --> 01:08:15.128
Something that people ask me all the time
is how we have two kids with Pompe.


844
01:08:15.969 --> 01:08:20.065
By the time we realized
that Megan had Pompe,


845
01:08:21.074 --> 01:08:23.167
I was already pregnant with Patrick.

846
01:08:23.277 --> 01:08:26.075
I mean, I can't tell you
how many doctors we saw,


847
01:08:26.180 --> 01:08:27.909
and the message was always the same,

848
01:08:28.015 --> 01:08:31.212
that there is no drug to treat Pompe.

849
01:08:31.318 --> 01:08:35.152
But thanks to you, all of you,
that message is changing.


850
01:08:35.255 --> 01:08:39.715
What you've given us,
and a lot of other families, is hope.


851
01:08:39.827 --> 01:08:41.385
So, thank you.

852
01:08:42.663 --> 01:08:44.494
Good job, Aileen.

853
01:08:47.301 --> 01:08:50.361
Now I'd like to welcome the Temple family,

854
01:08:50.470 --> 01:08:54.497
who've come all the way from Georgia
to be with us here today.


855
01:09:00.314 --> 01:09:01.941
Thanks, John.

856
01:09:05.118 --> 01:09:06.312
Hi.

857
01:09:07.888 --> 01:09:09.480
I'm Marcus.

858
01:09:10.624 --> 01:09:12.785
This is my wife, Wendy.

859
01:09:12.893 --> 01:09:15.794
Our daughter Lauren, our oldest daughter,

860
01:09:15.896 --> 01:09:20.856
Lauren wanted to come today
and say hi to all you guys.


861
01:09:22.903 --> 01:09:24.393
She's a little weak,

862
01:09:24.504 --> 01:09:29.635
but she wanted us
to show you guys her picture


863
01:09:30.143 --> 01:09:32.771
and to send you her love.

864
01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:36.911
And this is our daughter, Megan.

865
01:09:37.017 --> 01:09:40.453
The most beautiful girls are named Megan.

866
01:09:41.555 --> 01:09:45.685
Megan is four months old,
and you can't see it yet,


867
01:09:47.060 --> 01:09:49.051
but she has Pompe, too.

868
01:10:03.010 --> 01:10:04.375
I...

869
01:10:06.413 --> 01:10:10.349
I can't tell you
what it means to us

870
01:10:12.052 --> 01:10:16.421
to have all of you working on a medicine
for our children.


871
01:10:19.192 --> 01:10:20.591
Thank you.

872
01:10:27.401 --> 01:10:29.028
Thanks so much.

873
01:10:37.477 --> 01:10:39.604
- Hey, Kent.
- John.


874
01:10:39.713 --> 01:10:42.341
So what did you think of the event?

875
01:10:47.821 --> 01:10:53.225
In medical research, John,
objectivity is key.


876
01:10:54.728 --> 01:10:57.822
If researchers get all emotional,

877
01:10:57.931 --> 01:11:02.527
all desperate to help suffering patients,
they'll cut corners.


878
01:11:02.636 --> 01:11:03.830
It's counterproductive.

879
01:11:03.937 --> 01:11:08.670
Counterproductive is having
four core teams of scientists


880
01:11:08.775 --> 01:11:13.212
working together on the same disease,
but not talking to each other.


881
01:11:13.747 --> 01:11:17.080
Most of these guys have never
even seen a kid with Pompe before.


882
01:11:17.184 --> 01:11:18.947
I don't see how that's relevant.

883
01:11:19.086 --> 01:11:23.318
Did you see Erich?
That's the kind of motivation that we need.


884
01:11:23.423 --> 01:11:27.860
I'm gonna ask him to get the core team
to stop competing, start working together.


885
01:11:27.961 --> 01:11:30.225
Create a leadership team.

886
01:11:32.299 --> 01:11:35.860
Well, if you hope to sell
this leadership team idea,


887
01:11:35.969 --> 01:11:38.164
there's only one way to convince Erich.

888
01:11:38.271 --> 01:11:39.602
And what's that?

889
01:11:39.706 --> 01:11:42.573
Keep your guy, 
Stonehill, off the team.

890
01:11:43.443 --> 01:11:48.938
In his short tenure here, he's managed to
alienate a remarkable number of colleagues.


891
01:11:49.049 --> 01:11:52.041
You can't put him on a team
that's supposed to build cooperation.


892
01:11:52.152 --> 01:11:56.145
So, decide how badly
you want your leadership team,


893
01:11:57.724 --> 01:12:00.090
then do what you have to do.

894
01:12:12.205 --> 01:12:13.638
That's it.

895
01:12:19.513 --> 01:12:21.481
Dr. Stonehill, please.

896
01:12:22.315 --> 01:12:24.442
Turn it down. Yes.

897
01:12:24.985 --> 01:12:26.816
Yes, the music.

898
01:12:30.090 --> 01:12:31.955
I said down!

899
01:12:33.660 --> 01:12:35.491
This guy's impossible.

900
01:12:35.595 --> 01:12:37.392
I like that song.

901
01:12:44.237 --> 01:12:45.397
Hey.

902
01:12:51.244 --> 01:12:53.007
What's up, John?

903
01:12:53.513 --> 01:12:56.539
- Everything all right at home?
- Yeah.


904
01:12:59.719 --> 01:13:02.517
Have you heard that Erich Loring

905
01:13:02.622 --> 01:13:05.921
has agreed to put together
a leadership team?


906
01:13:06.726 --> 01:13:09.024
Yeah, I heard some rumor about it.
What bullshit.


907
01:13:09.129 --> 01:13:14.431
Now I'm gonna have to spend a couple of
hours a week jawin<i>'</i> with Zymagen guys?


908
01:13:15.469 --> 01:13:16.595
No.

909
01:13:16.903 --> 01:13:20.839
No. No, you won't,
'cause I'm not putting you on the team.


910
01:13:21.274 --> 01:13:23.003
What'd you say?

911
01:13:23.276 --> 01:13:25.107
I really wanted to.

912
01:13:25.912 --> 01:13:28.676
You're not putting me on the team?
Is that what you said?


913
01:13:28.782 --> 01:13:31.546
What are you, some varsity track coach?

914
01:13:32.252 --> 01:13:37.690
They didn't buy our company 'cause
they like your Ivy League charm, Jersey.


915
01:13:37.924 --> 01:13:39.721
It's me they wanted.

916
01:13:39.826 --> 01:13:43.557
You can't bench me.
It's against the laws of nature.


917
01:13:43.663 --> 01:13:47.690
You're still gonna be able
to prove that your theory is right.


918
01:13:47.801 --> 01:13:52.966
Yeah, but other scientists are gonna
evaluate my results, right? Not me.


919
01:13:53.073 --> 01:13:57.305
Everyone here reveres your science.

920
01:13:57.410 --> 01:14:02.541
This is about interpersonal issues.

921
01:14:03.283 --> 01:14:06.912
- Who put you up to this?
- The decision was mine.


922
01:14:09.122 --> 01:14:11.750
It's for the overall good of the program.

923
01:14:11.858 --> 01:14:14.588
"For the overall good of the program."

924
01:14:15.795 --> 01:14:18.263
Wow, John, you really got
the corporate lingo down good.


925
01:14:18.365 --> 01:14:20.959
What's next, "Acceptable loss?"

926
01:14:37.551 --> 01:14:38.609
No.

927
01:14:38.718 --> 01:14:40.310
Does anybody really know how to do this?

928
01:14:40.453 --> 01:14:42.011
Except for us.

929
01:14:43.223 --> 01:14:46.659
- But wait, who's going?
- It's John's turn still.


930
01:14:48.161 --> 01:14:49.423
Nice one.

931
01:14:50.997 --> 01:14:52.794
Okay. I'll get it.

932
01:14:59.339 --> 01:15:00.772
Nice one, Megs.

933
01:15:00.874 --> 01:15:04.002
Hello? Marcus, hi.

934
01:15:04.911 --> 01:15:06.037
Oh, my God.

935
01:15:06.580 --> 01:15:08.514
Man. I almost got 'em down.

936
01:15:08.648 --> 01:15:11.845
You guys sit tight, okay?
Here, John, grab him.


937
01:15:11.985 --> 01:15:16.115
If there is anything we can do,
anything at all, will you call?


938
01:15:16.656 --> 01:15:19.989
Okay.
We love you guys so much.


939
01:15:21.261 --> 01:15:22.853
Okay, bye-bye.

940
01:15:25.031 --> 01:15:26.396
Aileen.

941
01:15:28.835 --> 01:15:30.826
That was Marcus Temple.

942
01:15:31.905 --> 01:15:33.236
Lauren...

943
01:15:34.541 --> 01:15:35.803
She...

944
01:15:39.212 --> 01:15:41.942
He said she went in her sleep,
that it was peaceful.


945
01:15:42.048 --> 01:15:43.640
How old is she?

946
01:15:45.018 --> 01:15:46.918
How old was Lauren?

947
01:15:52.192 --> 01:15:54.353
Lauren was nine years old.

948
01:16:01.968 --> 01:16:03.492
Come here.

949
01:16:13.780 --> 01:16:17.614
That way, we can be certain
that we're developing the correct one.


950
01:16:17.884 --> 01:16:24.016
Forget certainty, and let's try and figure out
which enzyme has the better odds.


951
01:16:24.224 --> 01:16:26.852
If we develop only one enzyme,

952
01:16:28.328 --> 01:16:30.125
what would happen
if we guessed the wrong one?


953
01:16:30.230 --> 01:16:35.224
Mr. Crowley, I've asked Kent
to set up a testing protocol


954
01:16:35.335 --> 01:16:37.530
to help us guess right.

955
01:16:38.271 --> 01:16:41.138
We'll do an exhaustive range of tests.

956
01:16:41.241 --> 01:16:44.972
I'm calling it
"The Mother of All Experiments."


957
01:16:46.946 --> 01:16:51.440
The four enzymes will be color-coded,
yellow, blue, green and magenta,


958
01:16:51.584 --> 01:16:53.643
and known only by those color codes

959
01:16:53.787 --> 01:16:56.984
so no researcher will know
which one he's testing.


960
01:16:57.123 --> 01:17:01.423
Only after we pick a winner,
the secret identity will be revealed.


961
01:17:08.268 --> 01:17:09.929
Come on, Megan!

962
01:17:21.648 --> 01:17:22.740
But I want to!

963
01:17:28.288 --> 01:17:30.848
- Just roll your wrist.
- I can't.


964
01:17:35.328 --> 01:17:36.989
It's okay. It's all right. 
Let's try another one.

965
01:17:37.130 --> 01:17:39.621
Okay. Let's try again. Ready?

966
01:17:41.868 --> 01:17:43.267
Ready?

967
01:17:43.370 --> 01:17:45.531
One, two, three, go!

968
01:17:47.874 --> 01:17:50.274
- Big winner!
- Yay!


969
01:17:51.478 --> 01:17:54.811
Here you go, look at that. 
You got a penguin.

970
01:18:04.524 --> 01:18:06.492
Hey, Bob. Bob.

971
01:18:08.595 --> 01:18:10.187
How you doin'

972
01:18:15.835 --> 01:18:17.894
I brought you some ribs.

973
01:18:18.705 --> 01:18:22.072
Not as good as the ones
from The Corner Saloon,


974
01:18:22.175 --> 01:18:24.200
but if you're hungry...

975
01:18:34.854 --> 01:18:36.549
What do you want?

976
01:18:39.526 --> 01:18:41.153
The results.

977
01:18:42.729 --> 01:18:44.594
"Mother of All Experiments."

978
01:18:44.731 --> 01:18:45.993
Well,

979
01:18:48.234 --> 01:18:50.327
which enzyme did they choose?

980
01:18:50.437 --> 01:18:53.998
The leadership team
spent the whole afternoon arguing.


981
01:18:54.107 --> 01:18:57.543
Two enzymes, coded yellow and green,
are ahead of the others,


982
01:18:57.644 --> 01:18:59.942
but it's too close to call.

983
01:19:00.079 --> 01:19:05.176
Tomorrow, we spend the day hashing it out
to decide which one to choose.


984
01:19:06.986 --> 01:19:10.615
Bob. I'm asking you to read this.

985
01:19:11.257 --> 01:19:14.693
I value your opinion
more than anyone else in the world.


986
01:19:14.794 --> 01:19:17.354
Well, maybe you should have valued
my opinion a little sooner,


987
01:19:17.464 --> 01:19:21.025
instead of playing hatchet man
for the bean counters.


988
01:19:22.135 --> 01:19:26.697
- Get the hell out of my lab.
- It's in your interest to know about this, Bob.


989
01:19:29.809 --> 01:19:31.208
Get out.

990
01:19:31.311 --> 01:19:33.939
- Wouldn't it benefit you...
- Get out.


991
01:19:58.371 --> 01:20:03.001
The green enzyme's the best.
Show 'em my analysis, they'll understand.


992
01:20:04.110 --> 01:20:05.805
Hey, wait up, Bob.

993
01:20:06.813 --> 01:20:08.678
Is the green enzyme yours?

994
01:20:08.815 --> 01:20:12.751
I recognize patterns in the results.
I'd know my baby a mile away.


995
01:20:12.852 --> 01:20:15.320
- So the green one is yours?
- No.


996
01:20:15.855 --> 01:20:17.447
No, it's not.

997
01:20:20.193 --> 01:20:24.357
My theory is still the best,
but it's not ready for manufacture.


998
01:20:25.632 --> 01:20:28.795
Theirs is crude and uninspired,
but it's ready.


999
01:20:30.470 --> 01:20:33.871
Bob, I don't even know the words
to say thank you.


1000
01:20:34.874 --> 01:20:36.341
Don't bother.

1001
01:20:38.511 --> 01:20:40.536
I didn't do it for you.

1002
01:21:27.393 --> 01:21:28.758
Yes, it is!

1003
01:21:31.564 --> 01:21:33.532
- Oh, my gosh. Do you see the kite up there?
- Yeah.


1004
01:21:33.633 --> 01:21:34.759
That's so cool!

1005
01:21:34.901 --> 01:21:36.562
Annie, careful!

1006
01:21:37.203 --> 01:21:39.171
- Building a bastion.
- Right there. Yeah.


1007
01:21:44.310 --> 01:21:45.436
- Three!
- Okay!


1008
01:21:45.545 --> 01:21:46.637
Dad, like... Ready?

1009
01:21:46.746 --> 01:21:50.182
- Dad, you promised no more phone calls.
- I know. I know I did, but...


1010
01:21:50.283 --> 01:21:51.307
What's in there?

1011
01:21:51.417 --> 01:21:53.715
We can take turns burying the phone
when I get back.


1012
01:21:53.820 --> 01:21:55.378
Okay! I'll start digging a hole.

1013
01:21:55.488 --> 01:21:58.116
- You hold that for a sec.
- John Crowley.


1014
01:21:58.625 --> 01:22:00.422
John, it's Kent Weber.

1015
01:22:00.560 --> 01:22:03.723
Kent, hey. Did you get
my suggested protocol for the clinical trials?


1016
01:22:05.064 --> 01:22:06.258
Yeah.

1017
01:22:07.800 --> 01:22:09.859
You made some
pretty optimistic assumptions


1018
01:22:09.969 --> 01:22:12.767
about where our enzyme supply will be.

1019
01:22:13.306 --> 01:22:14.603
I see.

1020
01:22:15.475 --> 01:22:20.003
Well, what do you think
that a more realistic...


1021
01:22:20.113 --> 01:22:25.881
John, I'll give it to you straight.
The clinical trial will be for infants only.


1022
01:22:27.186 --> 01:22:29.586
<i>Infants need so much less enzyme,</i>

1023
01:22:29.689 --> 01:22:32.487
<i>and, as you know,</i>
<i>our initial supply will be so limited.</i>


1024
01:22:32.959 --> 01:22:36.690
And the drug has much higher odds
of being effective


1025
01:22:36.796 --> 01:22:39.356
with infants than with older children.

1026
01:22:39.465 --> 01:22:42.901
We have to consult Erich on this.
We have to consult Erich.


1027
01:22:43.469 --> 01:22:46.336
I already did. He confirmed the decision.
Infants only.


1028
01:22:46.839 --> 01:22:49.933
<i>I understand your personal reasons for...</i>

1029
01:22:52.712 --> 01:22:57.945
These decisions have to be
made objectively, rationally.


1030
01:22:59.152 --> 01:23:01.279
I'm sorry. I...

1031
01:23:02.955 --> 01:23:03.979
I really am.

1032
01:26:17.650 --> 01:26:19.174
Hold it, pal.

1033
01:26:22.688 --> 01:26:26.180
- Mr. Crowley, what are you doin<i>'</i> in here?
- I was just...


1034
01:26:26.292 --> 01:26:29.921
- You're not authorized.
- No... I can explain everything.


1035
01:26:30.029 --> 01:26:31.894
What's the matter, Chuck?
Is there a problem?


1036
01:26:31.998 --> 01:26:35.456
Yeah, there's a problem.
I got Mr. Crowley in here without clearance.


1037
01:26:35.568 --> 01:26:36.933
That's my fault, now.

1038
01:26:37.036 --> 01:26:42.269
I got busy in the lab, I sent Jersey boy here
to get me a couple jugs of enzyme.


1039
01:26:42.842 --> 01:26:44.139
Sorry.

1040
01:26:54.220 --> 01:26:55.778
Thanks, Chuck.

1041
01:27:02.194 --> 01:27:04.355
Thanks for saving my ass.

1042
01:27:05.765 --> 01:27:07.790
It's really big of you,

1043
01:27:07.900 --> 01:27:12.496
especially after what went down between us.

1044
01:27:13.940 --> 01:27:17.239
You mean your ruthless,
cold-hearted betrayal?


1045
01:27:20.513 --> 01:27:24.540
Yeah, well, when I thought about it
from your point of view...


1046
01:27:25.284 --> 01:27:30.381
Shit, if it was my kids dying, I wouldn't
have hesitated to crush you like a bug.


1047
01:27:44.971 --> 01:27:47.235
Do you remember when we first met,

1048
01:27:47.373 --> 01:27:52.538
and you told me that
I should stop chasing miracles


1049
01:27:52.645 --> 01:27:55.546
and should go home and enjoy my kids,

1050
01:27:56.916 --> 01:27:59.077
while they're still here?

1051
01:28:03.923 --> 01:28:06.414
- Yeah.
- I made the wrong choice.


1052
01:28:22.375 --> 01:28:26.334
- Jersey, you know what a sibling study is?
- No.


1053
01:28:26.445 --> 01:28:31.314
It's a drug trial with just two patients
with the same genetic inheritance.


1054
01:28:32.551 --> 01:28:36.317
Siblings, with the same disease.

1055
01:28:36.422 --> 01:28:38.151
Megs and Patrick.

1056
01:28:40.159 --> 01:28:43.424
Well, would Zymagen
go for something like this?


1057
01:28:44.497 --> 01:28:47.295
There's real research value in it.

1058
01:28:47.466 --> 01:28:50.731
And with just two patients,
it wouldn't take much enzyme.


1059
01:28:50.836 --> 01:28:53.805
But Webber would have
to sign off on it.

1060
01:28:54.974 --> 01:28:58.466
Well, let's not tell him
till we've got our ducks in a row.


1061
01:28:58.611 --> 01:29:03.913
I could draw up a protocol and see if I can
find a hospital willing to administer it.


1062
01:29:04.784 --> 01:29:08.584
- Bob.
- Well, don't get your hopes up, kid.


1063
01:29:10.890 --> 01:29:12.653
It's a Hail Mary.

1064
01:29:44.924 --> 01:29:46.551
Ducks in a row.

1065
01:29:49.528 --> 01:29:51.894
"Stonehill, careful review, protocol,
Sibling Trial,146,


1066
01:29:51.997 --> 01:29:53.430
"are pleased to inform you Megan Crowley
and Patrick


1067
01:29:53.532 --> 01:29:55.056
"have been accepted into the trial!"

1068
01:29:55.234 --> 01:29:57.930
- I just got it.
- Quack, quack, quack.


1069
01:29:58.037 --> 01:29:59.334
Have you talked to him yet?

1070
01:29:59.438 --> 01:30:03.670
No. I did the science. 
You make the sale.

1071
01:30:05.578 --> 01:30:06.977
Thank you.

1072
01:30:07.446 --> 01:30:09.311
- Good luck.
- Right.


1073
01:30:16.088 --> 01:30:17.988
- Does he have about five?
- He does, yeah.


1074
01:30:18.090 --> 01:30:20.558
- Thanks.
- No problem, Mr. Crowley.


1075
01:30:22.461 --> 01:30:24.429
Hey, Kent? Knock-knock.

1076
01:30:26.632 --> 01:30:28.099
Got a minute?

1077
01:30:29.735 --> 01:30:30.997
Kent?

1078
01:30:32.304 --> 01:30:36.502
- Do you have any idea what you've done?
- Excuse me?


1079
01:30:36.609 --> 01:30:39.100
We got a call this morning
from Portland Rose Hospital,


1080
01:30:39.211 --> 01:30:41.372
about sending them enzyme for your kids?

1081
01:30:41.480 --> 01:30:44.005
Right. Yeah, I know.
That's what I'm here to talk to you about.


1082
01:30:44.116 --> 01:30:47.984
You and Stonehill set this up behind
my back. Now you come to me.


1083
01:30:48.087 --> 01:30:49.987
It's all tentative.

1084
01:30:50.089 --> 01:30:54.185
You want this company
to sponsor a drug study,


1085
01:30:54.293 --> 01:30:58.627
for two children whose father
is an executive of this company?


1086
01:30:58.731 --> 01:31:00.722
Have you never heard the term
"conflict of interest?"


1087
01:31:00.833 --> 01:31:01.993
It has nothing to do with a...

1088
01:31:02.101 --> 01:31:03.898
Do you know what the FDA would do
if they found out?


1089
01:31:04.003 --> 01:31:07.200
There is strong scientific justification
for this study.


1090
01:31:07.306 --> 01:31:09.171
There is great research value.

1091
01:31:09.275 --> 01:31:12.403
I'm a doctor, John.
I know the research value!


1092
01:31:13.279 --> 01:31:16.510
But you guys just can't go off half-cocked
without consulting us!


1093
01:31:16.615 --> 01:31:18.583
And I'm sure that if we just go
and talk to Erich, we can...


1094
01:31:18.684 --> 01:31:20.083
Erich already knows.

1095
01:31:20.186 --> 01:31:24.020
- He's furious about being blindsided.
- I didn't try to blindside anyone.


1096
01:31:24.123 --> 01:31:27.718
This is the reason
why we have a reporting structure,


1097
01:31:27.826 --> 01:31:31.660
why we have established procedure,
why there is protocol.


1098
01:31:33.465 --> 01:31:36.025
You heartless, bloodless machine.

1099
01:31:36.135 --> 01:31:39.696
You just have to fight me
every step of the way! Don't you?


1100
01:31:39.805 --> 01:31:43.673
You just hated it when I brought
the kids with Pompe to the doorstep!


1101
01:31:43.776 --> 01:31:47.678
You weren't thinking about those kids when
you put your children into that program


1102
01:31:47.780 --> 01:31:52.683
and jeopardized a decade's worth of
research investment made by this company!


1103
01:31:52.785 --> 01:31:55.413
This is not about
a return on an investment!

1104
01:31:55.521 --> 01:31:57.250
It's about kids,

1105
01:31:58.157 --> 01:32:00.853
kids with names, dreams,

1106
01:32:02.528 --> 01:32:04.655
families that love them.

1107
01:32:05.297 --> 01:32:09.529
You've jeopardized your chances
of ever getting your kids treated.


1108
01:32:38.030 --> 01:32:41.295
I'm not arguing science with you!

1109
01:32:42.268 --> 01:32:44.862
On every level!
On every level, you've stood...


1110
01:33:00.686 --> 01:33:03.985
I was just drafting a letter of apology
for senior management,


1111
01:33:04.089 --> 01:33:07.024
but I guess we're past that point.

1112
01:33:08.794 --> 01:33:12.890
I just spoke to Erich,
and we are terminating your employment.


1113
01:33:14.566 --> 01:33:16.500
Okay, I'll pack up my stuff.

1114
01:33:16.602 --> 01:33:18.627
Just one thing, John.

1115
01:33:18.737 --> 01:33:23.606
I may well be
a tight-ass pencil-pushing company man,


1116
01:33:23.709 --> 01:33:26.007
but I resent being called heartless.

1117
01:33:26.111 --> 01:33:28.511
- Look...
- Just let me finish.


1118
01:33:29.481 --> 01:33:31.813
The reason we're terminating
your employment,


1119
01:33:31.917 --> 01:33:34.886
is to eliminate the conflict of interest.

1120
01:33:35.587 --> 01:33:39.990
This strategy was brought to my attention
by our colleague, Dr. Stonehill,


1121
01:33:40.092 --> 01:33:42.185
in rather crude terms.

1122
01:33:43.829 --> 01:33:46.957
This will allow the sibling trial to proceed

1123
01:33:47.766 --> 01:33:50.360
for its purely scientific value.

1124
01:33:54.673 --> 01:33:57.938
Have your desk cleared out
by the end of the day.


1125
01:33:58.911 --> 01:34:01.072
Kent, what's with the...

1126
01:34:04.149 --> 01:34:08.711
I wanted to make sure you didn't
punch me out before I could tell you.


1127
01:34:09.988 --> 01:34:11.250
Well,

1128
01:34:13.759 --> 01:34:17.092
- thank you very much for firing me.
- My pleasure.


1129
01:34:17.629 --> 01:34:19.927
- I never liked you.
- Likewise.


1130
01:34:24.470 --> 01:34:25.767
Hey, you guys,
bring anything you want extra...


1131
01:34:25.871 --> 01:34:26.895
- Mom! Mom!
- What?


1132
01:34:27.005 --> 01:34:28.768
- Can I bring the bow and arrow?
- Yes, yes.


1133
01:34:32.511 --> 01:34:33.773
Hey!

1134
01:34:39.551 --> 01:34:41.143
John, what...

1135
01:34:42.121 --> 01:34:43.281
What?

1136
01:34:44.289 --> 01:34:49.693
We have a usable enzyme
that's ready for clinical trials.


1137
01:34:52.631 --> 01:34:54.531
When? When will it be ready?

1138
01:34:54.633 --> 01:34:58.433
Megs and Patrick start their infusions
before the end of this month.


1139
01:34:58.537 --> 01:35:00.664
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.


1140
01:35:02.007 --> 01:35:03.474
Oh, my God.

1141
01:35:05.677 --> 01:35:06.871
John.

1142
01:35:07.546 --> 01:35:09.571
Hey, John, Daddy's here.

1143
01:35:09.681 --> 01:35:11.808
- Oh, hi, guys.
- Hey, Dad.


1144
01:35:12.684 --> 01:35:14.447
Why is Mommy sad?

1145
01:35:15.521 --> 01:35:18.319
Not sad, baby, so happy.

1146
01:35:21.660 --> 01:35:22.991
So happy.

1147
01:35:23.095 --> 01:35:24.995
Why is Mommy being so weird?

1148
01:35:25.097 --> 01:35:27.759
Well, it's because
we got the special medicine


1149
01:35:27.866 --> 01:35:31.302
for you, Megs, and for you, Patrick,
and you're gonna get it really soon.


1150
01:35:31.403 --> 01:35:32.836
That's great!

1151
01:35:48.420 --> 01:35:50.888
So, who wants to push the button?

1152
01:36:04.470 --> 01:36:07.234
Megs, Patrick, you ready?

1153
01:36:26.425 --> 01:36:28.689
When will we know if it's working?

1154
01:36:28.794 --> 01:36:30.853
It'll be a while, honey.

1155
01:36:30.963 --> 01:36:32.555
It's not pink.

1156
01:37:12.137 --> 01:37:15.470
Excuse me?
Your Uncle Bobby is here.


1157
01:37:17.142 --> 01:37:18.632
I don't know.

1158
01:37:25.717 --> 01:37:28.345
- You can go back if you like.
- Okay.


1159
01:37:33.792 --> 01:37:35.851
- John.
- Uncle Bobby.


1160
01:37:37.029 --> 01:37:40.157
They wouldn't let me
in unless I was family.

1161
01:37:42.901 --> 01:37:45.961
- Some things for the kids.
- Thanks.


1162
01:37:46.071 --> 01:37:47.663
Sleeping, huh?

1163
01:37:53.045 --> 01:37:55.036
Hey, thanks for coming.

1164
01:37:59.017 --> 01:38:02.111
I'm a scientist. 
Gotta track the experiment.

1165
01:38:11.563 --> 01:38:15.021
I wish your enzyme was the one
that passed the test.


1166
01:38:15.500 --> 01:38:20.995
But the one the kids are getting,
it's the right one, right? I mean...


1167
01:38:21.740 --> 01:38:23.640
It's gonna help them.

1168
01:38:28.113 --> 01:38:30.638
Yeah, you guys have done
everything humanly possible.


1169
01:38:30.749 --> 01:38:34.981
We just have to
see what the tests show.

1170
01:38:37.723 --> 01:38:40.624
You and I have had our differences,

1171
01:38:40.726 --> 01:38:44.218
and I just want you to know something.

1172
01:38:45.263 --> 01:38:46.821
I want you to know that...

1173
01:38:46.932 --> 01:38:48.729
- Yeah.
- Don't interrupt.


1174
01:38:48.834 --> 01:38:50.062
Okay.

1175
01:38:51.737 --> 01:38:55.764
I want you to know
that I appreciate everything


1176
01:38:55.874 --> 01:38:57.774
that you've done for Megs and Patrick,

1177
01:38:57.876 --> 01:39:01.471
and I'm never gonna forget it
for the rest of my life.


1178
01:39:05.183 --> 01:39:07.151
Not gonna kiss me, is he?

1179
01:39:07.252 --> 01:39:09.152
I will restrain him.

1180
01:39:10.589 --> 01:39:12.250
Don't tempt me.

1181
01:39:15.594 --> 01:39:19.394
Daddy loves SpongeBob,
Daddy loves SpongeBob.


1182
01:39:32.077 --> 01:39:34.307
- Stop!
- Daddy loves SpongeBob.


1183
01:39:34.413 --> 01:39:35.778
Guys?

1184
01:39:37.382 --> 01:39:39.077
What's going on?

1185
01:39:40.485 --> 01:39:42.214
What's so funny?

1186
01:39:43.655 --> 01:39:45.782
What are you laughing at?

1187
01:39:47.826 --> 01:39:49.953
What are you laughing at?

1188
01:39:50.829 --> 01:39:52.126
Sugar.

1189
01:39:55.834 --> 01:39:57.631
It's a sugar high.

1190
01:39:58.737 --> 01:40:02.138
The enzyme's breaking down
the sugar in their muscles.


1191
01:40:02.240 --> 01:40:04.731
- The medicine's working?
- Yeah.


1192
01:40:06.278 --> 01:40:07.472
John.

1193
01:40:16.521 --> 01:40:17.715
Megs!

1194
01:40:18.123 --> 01:40:19.215
Hi.

1195
01:40:37.909 --> 01:40:40.537
- John, drive safe!
- Enjoy the ride!


1196
01:40:42.981 --> 01:40:44.539
Rock and roll!

1197
01:40:46.017 --> 01:40:49.077
- Bye! Have fun.
- Bye!


1198
01:41:27.759 --> 01:41:29.192
Yes!

1199
01:41:30.629 --> 01:41:33.359
Yeah! Yeah!
