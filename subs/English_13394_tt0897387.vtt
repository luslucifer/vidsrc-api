1
00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:37.467
There.
That's better.


2
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.100
All clean.

3
00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.020
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're awake


4
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.420
What are you doing here?

5
00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.980
- And what are you talking about?
- I'm talkin' about Santa Claus!


6
00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.300
Only 159 days left till
Christmas, so you better be good.


7
00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.020
I'd better be good? How 'bout this? You
better be scarce. Now go on.


8
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.860
I don't care about Christmas.

9
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.780
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way


10
00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.780
- Donkey!
- 51 days left till Christmas.


11
00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.220
Get your butt in gear
and get your marshmallows,


12
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.380
because without marshmallows,
sweet potatoes are nothin'!


13
00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.580
Enough! I don't care
about any of this nonsense.


14
00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:27.700
Now shoo!

15
00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.900
OK. But don't say
I didn't say I told you so.


16
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.820
Smashing through the snow
And laughin' all the way


17
00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.380
It's finally here. Tomorrow's Christmas
Eve! Got everything ready?


18
00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.260
- No.
- You haven't trimmed stockings


19
00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.500
or hung your chestnuts
or roasted the tree?


20
00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.460
- Or figgified your puddin'?
- Donkey!


21
00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.260
Will you get it through your head?

22
00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.580
No one here gives
a hoot about Christmas!


23
00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.460
A white Christmas!
How perfect.


24
00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.020
And it's our first one together
as a family. Isn't this exciting?


25
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.580
Oh, yeah!
How 'bout that?


26
00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.540
There's somethin' 
Shrek needs to...

27
00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:05.820
Don't ruin the surprise
for her, Donkey.


28
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.700
Surprise?
Oh, I love surprises!


29
00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.900
You're the best. Come on,
let's go make some cookies.


30
00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.580
OK, you a dead man.
You know that?


31
00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.580
Hold that thought.
I'll be right back.


32
00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.940
OH, good, you're still open.

33
00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.820
No, we're closing now.
Merry Christmas.


34
00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.980
Wait, wait, wait! I need your help.
I have to make a Christmas,


35
00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.580
and I have no idea
what it is or how to do it!


36
00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.660
Why didn't you say so?
That's super.


37
00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.300
I know all about Christmas,
and I've just the book.


38
00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.340
Christmas for Village Idiots.
It's all spelled out. See?


39
00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.900
One, decorate house.
Two, the stockings by the fireplace.


40
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.340
Step three, the Christmas feast.

41
00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.740
- What's that?
- Step four? The Christmas tree!


42
00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.620
The tree goes inside the house?

43
00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.940
Anyway, step five, the telling
of the Christmas story.


44
00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.100
This is the step that says
I created the perfect Christmas


45
00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.860
for my perfect family perfectly.
Family by the fire,


46
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.340
everyone cozy and warm.
Happy, happy. Voila!


47
00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.140
- Sure.
- Long story short,


48
00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.100
it's all right here.
It's no problem.


49
00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.060
- Perfect.
- I mean, how hard can it be?


50
00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.860
- I didn't get the eggnog!
- Closed?! What do you mean?


51
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.100
- Dwight the Knight action figure?
- Marshmallows!


52
00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.820
Sweet potatoes are nothing
without marshmallows!


53
00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:35.860
Bye-bye. Have a super Christmas.

54
00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.660
Honey, is that you?

55
00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.940
Fiona! What are
you doing up so early?


56
00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.540
- Are you OK?
- I'm all right.


57
00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.780
What are you? Are you decorating?

58
00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.380
- Yeah, that. Surprised?
- Yes.


59
00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:04.660
Well, this is our first
Christmas together as a family,


60
00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.860
and, you know, I just want to
make sure that it's perfect.


61
00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.980
Shrek, I think... it's beautiful.

62
00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:12.860
- It's passable.
- It's horrible!


63
00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.220
- Donkey!
- They usually toilet paper and run.


64
00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.940
Whoever did this means business!
Get rid of all this


65
00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:19.940
and get tinsel and doilies and ribbons

66
00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:21.500
and some plastic reindeer.

67
00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:23.500
What is it you wanted today?

68
00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.580
It's Christmas Eve!
I've brought you a little somethin'.


69
00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.460
Go ahead, take a couple.
I bought plenty for everybody!


70
00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.100
Oh, isn't that... nice.

71
00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.420
Well, thanks for stopping by for that
brief visit, but as you can see,


72
00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.180
there's a lot of work to do.

73
00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.180
Just like him to wait till last minute.

74
00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.940
Don't worry, there's one thing I
know, it's Christmas.


75
00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.860
He's gonna want help,
advice, and he's definitely...


76
00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.740
Actually, I think what he really wants
is a nice family Christmas.


77
00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.100
Oh, a family Christmas.

78
00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:56.140
Yeah. It's the
first one with the kids.


79
00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.540
Don't say a word.
I know exactly what you mean.


80
00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.980
I got a lot to do now,
so I better get movin'.


81
00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.340
Thank you, Donkey!
And Merry Christmas!


82
00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:04.900
All right. Merry Christmas!

83
00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:08.540
Love and joy come to you
and to me some waffles too


84
00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.740
Donkey's right. 
It's Christmas Eve.

85
00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:15.340
How am I ever gonna
get this done in time?


86
00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:17.660
This is gonna be
the best Christmas ever.


87
00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.020
And we're going to do it together,
so come on.


88
00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:46.220
Everything looks so good!

89
00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:47.820
Nice job, honey.

90
00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.140
Well, we all did it together.

91
00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:53.780
Now what would the perfect Christmas
be without a Christmas story?


92
00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:59.260
'Twas the night before Christmas
and all through the house


93
00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.580
Not a creature was stirring...
What?


94
00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:05.140
- Merry Christmas, Shrek!
- Oh, not you!


95
00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:07.260
We're here to smother you
with Christmas love!


96
00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:09.940
Absolutely not!
Bad Donkey! Go home!


97
00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:12.260
How are you gonna have
Christmas without family?


98
00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:14.180
- Seasons greeting!
- Happy Holidays!


99
00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.100
- Merry Christmas!
- A nice surprise!


100
00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:17.540
Oh, yeah.

101
00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:23.940
OK, I will assume the position.

102
00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:31.220
- I am the joy-filled swine!
- Yay, for the season of love!


103
00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.540
This is for stockings.
You can't be hanging laundry up!


104
00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:36.660
Donkey! Don't touch anything.

105
00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:40.220
How we gonna roast chestnuts
on this little bitty fire?


106
00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:41.300
Hey, baby, you mind?

107
00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:48.020
- Oh, boy!
- This way, gents.


108
00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:49.900
That was our supper!

109
00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:52.620
Hey!

110
00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:57.700
Did you hurt yourself
when you fell out of heaven?


111
00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:00.100
- Where are we going to put it?
- I don't know.


112
00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:03.180
Let's put it over here.
No, that is not with the feng shui.


113
00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.020
Come on, everybody, let's dance!

114
00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:20.620
- Occupied!
- It's me. Shrek?


115
00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:24.380
- Yes?
- Come back to the party. Please?


116
00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:26.460
I don't think
that'd be such a good idea.


117
00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:30.060
Come on. It's not that bad.

118
00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:32.860
OK, I know you're
not a party person, but...


119
00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:36.220
But what? This is not the
kind of Christmas I had in mind.


120
00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.580
They're our friends, Shrek.
They all mean well.


121
00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:42.500
- How many babies did Fiona have?
- She has babies?


122
00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:44.900
- I don't know.
- I better get back to the house.


123
00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:46.900
Surprised we have
a house to go back to.


124
00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:50.300
- Are you coming?
- I can hardly wait.


125
00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:52.140
Finally!

126
00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:01.340
Look at him go!

127
00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:03.220
Excuse me! Excuse me!

128
00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:04.940
Excuse you for what?

129
00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:07.860
I don't feel very good.

130
00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:12.180
- I feel better now.
- A chocolate chip!


131
00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:13.300
Sweetheart?

132
00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:19.420
Mind if I cut in?

133
00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:23.100
Don't stop believing

134
00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:27.260
Up and down the boulevard

135
00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:32.140
I am a little Christmas angel!

136
00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:34.100
Hey there, my sweeties.

137
00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:39.660
Would you like Daddy
to finish the story for you?


138
00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:40.940
Yeah?

139
00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:43.700
The children were nestled
all snug in their beds,


140
00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:47.020
- while visions of sugarplums...
- Were you tellin' 'em


141
00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:49.940
The Night Before Christmas?
That's the best Christmas story ever!


142
00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:51.900
- I'm the best teller ever!
- Donkey...


143
00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:53.460
I got it committed
to memorization!


144
00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:55.420
- Gather round!
- Donkey! Wait!


145
00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:57.820
I'm supposed to tell
the Christmas story.


146
00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:00.780
'Twas the night before Christmas
and I spent all the day


147
00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:03.580
Finishin' up on my Christmas display

148
00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:06.140
Now, missin' all this
would be nothin' but tragic


149
00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:08.860
So just follow me
and I'll show you the magic


150
00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:11.020
Now, out in the yard
in a glorious clutter


151
00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:13.820
Is a spectacle there that'll
make your heart flutter


152
00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:16.340
With 20-foot cheese balls
and a big eggnog fountain


153
00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:19.340
And yodelin' elves
on an ambrosia mountain


154
00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:21.820
A stage where acrobats
jump, leap and prance


155
00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:24.860
And honor the day
through interpretive dance


156
00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:27.980
But just when you think
the display is complete


157
00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:30.540
The Christmas parade
comes right down the street


158
00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:32.940
With holiday floats
all in silver and blue


159
00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:35.900
With sugarplum fairies
and a reindeer or two


160
00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:38.620
There's a baton-twirlin'
snowman all happy and perky


161
00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:41.460
Magical peacocks
and a dancin' roast turkey


162
00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:48.020
And right when you think
that you've just seen it all


163
00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:51.740
Comes a huge waffle Santa
that's 50 feet tall


164
00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:54.220
Ho, ho, ho!

165
00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:57.020
With syrup and butter
the sight just amazes


166
00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:59.740
As it's flanked by a choir
all singin' his praises


167
00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:10.060
- Donkey.
- Santa?


168
00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:11.340
- Donkey!
- Santa!


169
00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:13.260
Donkey!

170
00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:16.380
Very inappropriate, amigo.
Please, allow me.


171
00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:18.820
- Oh, Puss, not you too.
- In my homeland,


172
00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:21.740
we tell a very different tale
of the Santa Nicholas.


173
00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:24.060
He's not made of waffles.

174
00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:27.180
This Santa was suave
He was nothing like that


175
00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:31.300
The Santa I know
was a hot Latin cat


176
00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:35.220
He was dressed all in fur
from his head to his paws


177
00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:40.580
And he stood there heroic
A real Santa... Claws


178
00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:43.100
Red are his boots

179
00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:45.900
- And so is his cape
- Olé!


180
00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:49.780
His sword is a cane
that tastes like crab cake


181
00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:52.300
He wears a fine belt
and a leather cravat


182
00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:56.660
And there's a cute fuzzy thing
which hangs down from his hat


183
00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:09.420
I have shamed myself.

184
00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:11.620
- Olé!
- All right, everybody,


185
00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:14.460
if you leave now,
you can beat the holiday traffic.


186
00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:17.340
Phooey with all your
sunshine and lollipops!


187
00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:20.700
Where I come from,
Christmas is a nightmare.


188
00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:26.260
'Twas the night before Christmas
and the prettiest sights


189
00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:30.260
Were my sweetheart beside me
in the bright Christmas lights


190
00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:31.980
...until they got home.

191
00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:36.340
When they looked at the car door
handle, and they found a hook!


192
00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:40.860
Gingy, cut it out! You're
really givin' me the creeps!


193
00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:43.740
Oh, come on,
I was just teasin'.


194
00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:46.540
Come here, you.

195
00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:48.620
Gingy, I couldn't stay mad at you.

196
00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:50.300
What was that?

197
00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:53.020
Oh, no, you don't. I'm not
fallin' for that again.


198
00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:55.980
No, I'm really, really
seriously not kidding.


199
00:11:58.620 --> 00:11:59.540
Gingy!

200
00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:08.380
Suzie!

201
00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.860
No! No! No!

202
00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:14.340
That's the most ridiculous
thing I've ever heard.


203
00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:16.700
- That's not how it goes.
- You weren't there!


204
00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:19.900
All right, everyone,
I've had just about enough!


205
00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:24.060
All I wanted was a nice
Christmas with my family.


206
00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:28.220
That's exactly why we're all here!
Come on, let's finish tellin' my story.


207
00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:32.660
No, Donkey, that's not what I meant.
And get out of my chair.


208
00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:36.500
- Hey, what's this?
- Donkey, let go of the book.


209
00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:40.460
- Why are you whisperin'?
- I'm not kiddin'. Give me the book!


210
00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:46.260
- Heimlich!
- Ja?


211
00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:48.060
- No, Heimlich!
- Oh, ja!


212
00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:55.660
My eye!

213
00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:06.580
Stop, drop and roll, Shrek!

214
00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:08.660
- Somebody get some water!
- I got it!


215
00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:11.420
Don't worry, Shrek,
everything is under control!


216
00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:13.060
Oh, boy.

217
00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:18.260
- The tea is ready.
- Out!


218
00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:22.260
I want everybody out
of my house right now!


219
00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:29.260
Well, that's a real nice way
to treat your guests on Christmas!


220
00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:34.180
And if you think I'm gonna give you
a present now, you are sadly mistaken!


221
00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.660
You want to give me a present?
Then go away!


222
00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:39.580
- That's all I wanted!
- Fine! I'm going!


223
00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:40.980
Good, then go!

224
00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:44.660
You go and have yourself
a merry Christmas.


225
00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:48.180
- Ebenezer Shrek!
- And a "Bah, humbug" to you too!


226
00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:55.540
- We could come to our house.
- We have plenty of schnitzel.


227
00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:57.740
Now maybe we can...

228
00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:02.460
Fiona? Where you going?

229
00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:05.940
Shrek, you just kicked
everybody out on Christmas.


230
00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:08.380
Well, that wasn't Christmas.
That was chaos!


231
00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:11.260
Look, I know it didn't
go like you wanted.


232
00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:15.100
What I wanted was a perfect
Christmas for me and my family.


233
00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:17.660
- That was our family.
- You call that a family?


234
00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:19.860
That was a natural disaster!

235
00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:22.740
On Christmas, that's how it
works. Yes, it was crowded.


236
00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:24.780
Yes, it got
a little out of hand.


237
00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:28.060
- Fiona, they lit me on fire!
- Shrek...


238
00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:32.620
I had everything under control until
they showed up and ruined my Christmas!


239
00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:35.860
- Your Christmas?
- I mean our Christmas.


240
00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:38.420
For you, and the babies.

241
00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:43.300
Christmas is not just about
you or me. Or even the babies.


242
00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:46.460
You just don't get it.

243
00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:51.580
I have to go. I need to
apologize to our friends.


244
00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:53.620
Fiona, wait.

245
00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:42.900
I don't understand why
Shrek had to be so mean and cranky.


246
00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:44.700
We were tryin' to do what you wanted!

247
00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:47.580
- What're you talking about?
- What you said this morning.


248
00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:50.460
You and Shrek wanted to
have a big, noisy family Christmas.


249
00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:53.180
I said it was our first
Christmas together as a family.


250
00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:55.300
Right. That's me and everybody else.

251
00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:57.140
Then he lost his temper like that.

252
00:15:57.180 --> 00:16:00.380
You know, Donkey, none of us
really asked Shrek what he wanted.


253
00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:04.340
I must agree with the Princess.
And you, were no Christmas angel.


254
00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:07.220
- I don't remember askin' you anything!
- Donkey.


255
00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:10.060
I'm sorry, Princess. You're right.

256
00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:12.500
- Still, Shrek didn't have to be so...
- What?


257
00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:16.220
Pigheaded? Stubborn? Mean?

258
00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:21.100
Well, maybe I am all those
things, but I'm an ogre, OK?


259
00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:23.860
So here's the thing.

260
00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:27.500
I'm sorry you took getting kicked out
of my house the wrong way.


261
00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:31.260
No, wait. What I meant to say is

262
00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:35.180
I know you're just trying to be
helpful in your irritating fashion...


263
00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:39.340
- Ay, caramba!
- Some people can't help being annoying.


264
00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:42.420
- Shrek!
- Look,


265
00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:44.540
I shouldn't have lost my temper.

266
00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:47.260
- Apology accepted. Let's eat.
- Wait a minute.


267
00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:50.340
There's somethin' more to this.
Come on, what's goin' on?


268
00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:54.900
Look, all I wanted was to make
this perfect for my family,


269
00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:58.940
but I don't even know
what Christmas means.


270
00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:02.220
The thing is,
this is my first Christmas too.


271
00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:06.540
Hold up, Shrek! You mean
that you never had...


272
00:17:06.620 --> 00:17:07.660
- No.
- Not even one?


273
00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:09.220
- No!
- You mean no chestnuts,


274
00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:11.180
no Santa, no presents,
no stockings?


275
00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:13.420
- No nut cakes?!
- Donkey!


276
00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:16.700
No, none of that.

277
00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:20.060
Ogres don't celebrate Christmas.

278
00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:23.180
Ogres don't celebrate anything.

279
00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:28.500
Oh, man, now I'm all emotional.

280
00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:31.540
- Come here, gimme a hug!
- All right, that's close enough.


281
00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:34.140
OK, all right, I just...
guess I got... a little


282
00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:37.340
excited about Christmas and
all the presents and mistletoe


283
00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:40.420
and everything,
and I forgot that it's...


284
00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:44.060
It's about us all bein' together,
and I'm... I'm sorry, Shrek.


285
00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:48.060
I know, Donkey, and... and I'm sorry
it ended up in a great big fight.


286
00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:49.820
Christmas is all about big fights.

287
00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:53.300
My mama used to say, "Christmas ain't
Christmas till somebody cries."


288
00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:55.020
Usually that someone's me.

289
00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:57.820
There is no right way to
do Christmas. You just do it.


290
00:17:57.860 --> 00:17:59.300
Ja, with schnitzel!

291
00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:01.220
- And eggnog!
- And cheese!


292
00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:05.420
- And family.
- Yeah. And family.


293
00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:09.540
So despite the fact that you
drive me crazy at times...


294
00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:12.140
Yes, Donkey, I'm lookin' at you.

295
00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:16.660
...it would mean a lot to me if
you'd all come back and join us.


296
00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:21.220
OK, I guess I deserved that.

297
00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:22.700
Don't push your luck.

298
00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:25.980
They got you good, Shrek!

299
00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:28.500
That wasn't even funny!
Who did that?


300
00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:33.380
Well, that's the last
of the spare blankets.


301
00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:39.540
Sorry, but this is my spot. I never get
the good spots, so I specifically...


302
00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:44.380
So we are pigs,
pigs in the blanket, ja?


303
00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:45.780
- Ja.
- Ja.


304
00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:48.100
- This is funny then, ja?
- Ja, ja.


305
00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:49.300
- This is funny.
- Ja.


306
00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:52.020
- Yep, that's a good one.
- Good night, everyone.


307
00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:54.900
- It's time for lights out.
- We can't go to sleep yet.


308
00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:57.260
We haven't heard a bedtime story. Right?

309
00:18:57.340 --> 00:18:58.300
Shrek, yeah!

310
00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:01.820
All right. All right.

311
00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:04.820
Don't need this.

312
00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:06.580
OK.

313
00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:11.260
'Twas the night before Christmas

314
00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:13.460
Not a swamp rat did creep

315
00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:16.300
As mother and babe
played kazoo in their sleep


316
00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:21.660
Now, the sight of the house
would make any ogre droop


317
00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:25.100
For 'twas sickeningly sweet
as unicorn poop


318
00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:28.580
Yet who was arriving
to help this lost cause?


319
00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:33.220
The foul, the vile
and handsome Ogre Claus


320
00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:34.740
Hey. How's it goin'?

321
00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:37.460
He looked all around
and scratched at his beard


322
00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:39.300
And said...

323
00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:41.660
And said...

324
00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:45.060
This place is worse
than I thought... feared.


325
00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:48.220
So he grabbed up his belly
and screwed up his face


326
00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:49.340
And let loose a...

327
00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:53.580
That transformed the place

328
00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:56.740
With a gleam in his eye
his work here was done


329
00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:59.940
And then to the babies
he gave one by one


330
00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:02.820
A festering bottle
of stinky swamp juice


331
00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:06.340
And for mommy a kiss
and a good Christmas goose


332
00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:09.300
Four hundred twenty five degrees,

333
00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:12.580
Then digging a finger
inside of his nose


334
00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:16.540
And giving a nod up
the chimney he rose


335
00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:20.540
And I heard him exclaim
as he drove out of sight


336
00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:25.860
"Smelly Christmas to all,
and to all a gross night!"


337
00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:30.140
Ho, ho, ho!

338
00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:32.140
Ho, ho, ho!

339
00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:35.100
- Ho, ho, ho!
- Santa?!


340
00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:38.980
Ho, ho, ho!

341
00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:43.380
