00:00:26.457 --> 00:00:30.128
<i>'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves</i>

2
00:00:30.211 --> 00:00:33.590
<i>did gyre and gimble in the wabe.</i>

3
00:00:33.673 --> 00:00:36.843
<i>All mimsy were the borogoves,</i>

4
00:00:36.926 --> 00:00:39.554
<i>and the mome raths outgrabe.</i>

5
00:03:08.911 --> 00:03:12.248
<i>It is the middle of the Dark Ages.</i>

6
00:03:12.331 --> 00:03:17.045
<i>Ages darker than anyone
had ever expected.</i>


7
00:03:17.128 --> 00:03:22.383
<i>An horrendous monster
casts a dreadful pall of fear</i>


8
00:03:22.467 --> 00:03:24.844
<i>over a once-happy land.</i>

9
00:03:25.595 --> 00:03:28.973
<i>As towns and villages are torn apart,</i>

10
00:03:29.057 --> 00:03:32.226
<i>the helpless survivors seek refuge</i>

11
00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.313
<i>behind the walls of the great city.</i>

12
00:03:36.314 --> 00:03:39.067
<i>But out in the forest,</i>

13
00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.696
<i>in isolated pockets still untouched</i>

14
00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.616
<i>by the ravages of the monster,</i>

15
00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:52.455
<i>life and business goes on as usual.</i>

16
00:03:53.581 --> 00:03:57.502
Twelve, 13, 14.

17
00:03:57.585 --> 00:03:59.253
There's another little one. Fifteen.

18
00:03:59.337 --> 00:04:01.506
What are you doing
out there, Dennis?


19
00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:03.508
Stock-taking, Father.

20
00:04:03.591 --> 00:04:05.802
Thought you took stock this morning.

21
00:04:05.885 --> 00:04:06.969
Oh, yes, I did.

22
00:04:07.053 --> 00:04:09.806
But it never hurts to keep an accurate,
up-to-the-moment account of your stock.


23
00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:11.474
In business nowadays, Father...

24
00:04:11.557 --> 00:04:14.977
Never mind that nonsense
and come and help me with this cask.


25
00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:18.356
All right, Father.
I'll finish stock-taking later.


26
00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.193
There.

27
00:04:22.276 --> 00:04:26.781
You see, the secret of the craft
is to keep the stake...


28
00:04:28.533 --> 00:04:30.785
Take hold of the hoop.

29
00:04:30.868 --> 00:04:33.955
Hello, Dennis. Ralph.

30
00:04:34.705 --> 00:04:36.666
Oh.

31
00:04:37.625 --> 00:04:39.335
- Good day, Mr. Fishfinger.
- Aye.


32
00:04:39.418 --> 00:04:42.698
- Can I be of some assistance to you today?
- Oh, Dennis. What are you...


33
00:04:46.467 --> 00:04:49.637
Yes, well, uh, you see,
I need some barrels, Dennis,


34
00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.431
for shipping dried fish to the city.

35
00:04:52.515 --> 00:04:55.226
Big demand there, you know,
since this monster scare.


36
00:04:55.309 --> 00:04:58.271
Oh, my goodness.
Prices going up all the time.


37
00:04:58.354 --> 00:05:00.106
That's great. That's great.

38
00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:04.485
But tell me, do you believe all these stories
about, uh, whole villages being destroyed?


39
00:05:05.236 --> 00:05:07.697
Well, I haven't actually seen the monster
myself, you know.


40
00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.575
But when I was over in Muckley
the other day...


41
00:05:10.658 --> 00:05:12.994
Muckley?
That's quite a ways, isn't it?


42
00:05:13.077 --> 00:05:15.079
It's two mile or more, easy.

43
00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:18.624
Gosh, I'd like to travel someday,
Mr. Fishfinger.


44
00:05:19.417 --> 00:05:21.377
- Anyway, about the monster...
- Oh, yes.


45
00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:24.547
Well, uh, this grain merchant,
you see, over in Muckley,


46
00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:28.259
he claimed that he'd actually seen it.

47
00:05:30.261 --> 00:05:34.807
Turned his teeth snow-white
overnight, they say.


48
00:05:35.558 --> 00:05:38.853
Ugh.

49
00:05:38.936 --> 00:05:40.438
Anyway, about the barrels.

50
00:05:40.521 --> 00:05:42.899
Yes, well, must be cheap.

51
00:05:42.982 --> 00:05:44.901
First class, but cheap.
Must be cheap.


52
00:05:44.984 --> 00:05:47.528
I think we can attend to your needs,
Mr. Fishfinger.


53
00:05:47.612 --> 00:05:51.032
Exactly how, uh...
inexpensive?


54
00:05:52.533 --> 00:05:54.702
No more than a tuppence apiece.

55
00:05:54.785 --> 00:05:57.580
Tuppence?
What are you talking about, Fishfinger?


56
00:05:57.663 --> 00:06:00.958
I can't turn out a decent barrel
for that price and you know it.


57
00:06:01.042 --> 00:06:04.420
- Look, Father, don't you think...
- Now, Ralph, look, be sensible.


58
00:06:04.503 --> 00:06:08.090
The barrels have only got to last until
they get to the city. It's easy money.


59
00:06:08.174 --> 00:06:09.174
No!

60
00:06:09.217 --> 00:06:13.221
I don't make barrels
to last two or three days, Fishfinger.


61
00:06:14.096 --> 00:06:17.141
I make barrels to last a lifetime.
I'm a craftsman.


62
00:06:17.225 --> 00:06:20.186
- Yes, we know. Everybody knows.
- It's something you'll never understand.


63
00:06:20.269 --> 00:06:23.022
Or you either, Dennis, I'm afraid.

64
00:06:23.105 --> 00:06:26.734
You don't want barrels! 
You want bags!

65
00:06:26.817 --> 00:06:28.361
- I...
- Now get out!


66
00:06:28.444 --> 00:06:29.946
- Look, Father...
- Out!


67
00:06:30.029 --> 00:06:31.989
And don't come back here
with your shoddy deals.


68
00:06:32.073 --> 00:06:33.950
- Yes.
- Bah!


69
00:06:34.033 --> 00:06:36.035
- Good-bye. Good-bye, Ralph.
- Tuppence.


70
00:06:36.118 --> 00:06:39.580
- I'm sorry, Mr. Fishfinger.
- It's all right, Dennis. It's all right.


71
00:06:39.664 --> 00:06:42.291
He's given me a very good idea.

72
00:06:43.417 --> 00:06:44.420
It's all right.

73
00:06:44.445 --> 00:06:46.653
Wait, Mr. Fishfinger!
I think I can get it...


74
00:06:46.712 --> 00:06:49.090
Bye, Dennis. Salute!

75
00:06:49.173 --> 00:06:52.343
Tuppence.

76
00:07:02.687 --> 00:07:04.397
Griselda.

77
00:07:05.815 --> 00:07:08.067
- Griselda.
- Yeah?


78
00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:11.279
It is I, Dennis, come to see you.

79
00:07:11.362 --> 00:07:12.613
I see.

80
00:07:13.531 --> 00:07:16.200
How are you, my love?

81
00:07:18.035 --> 00:07:20.871
- Have you missed me?
- Huh?


82
00:07:20.955 --> 00:07:23.374
Oh, Griselda,
it's lovely to see you again.


83
00:07:23.457 --> 00:07:25.835
I think about you all day long
when I'm taking stock.


84
00:07:25.918 --> 00:07:28.879
I dream of the day when I'll ask your
father for your hand in marriage.


85
00:07:28.963 --> 00:07:30.881
We'll build that little cottage
near the village green.


86
00:07:30.965 --> 00:07:33.092
I'll come home from the shop.
We'll have supper together.


87
00:07:33.175 --> 00:07:36.345
Hey, Roger! Roger, what are you doing?

88
00:07:36.429 --> 00:07:37.930
- I just... You...
- What?


89
00:07:42.935 --> 00:07:44.103
Oh, Griselda.

90
00:07:45.021 --> 00:07:46.355
Sorry.

91
00:07:46.439 --> 00:07:47.815
Griselda.

92
00:07:48.899 --> 00:07:52.611
I can't ask you to declare your love for me
till I'm in a better position to marry you.


93
00:07:52.695 --> 00:07:56.073
But say you'll wait for me.
Say I've got a chance.


94
00:07:56.157 --> 00:07:58.159
Oh, let go.

95
00:07:58.242 --> 00:08:00.953
- Why, Griselda? Why?
- I've gotta scratch.


96
00:08:01.704 --> 00:08:03.873
Oh, Griselda. Griselda, I...

97
00:08:04.582 --> 00:08:06.459
Oh! Sorry, Dennis.

98
00:08:07.251 --> 00:08:10.212
- How's your father?
- Oh, never better, Mrs. Fishfinger.


99
00:08:13.883 --> 00:08:16.603
- That Dennis Cooper out there?
- Yes.


100
00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:19.847
Hello, Dennis.

101
00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:21.682
You've got garbage all over your vest.

102
00:08:21.766 --> 00:08:23.476
Tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk.

103
00:08:23.559 --> 00:08:27.355
Really ought to look after your appearance,
you know. Very bad for business.


104
00:08:27.438 --> 00:08:29.899
Oh, by the way,
I thought you'd like to know,


105
00:08:29.982 --> 00:08:32.902
I got Wat, the mercer,
to run me up a few cloth bags.


106
00:08:32.985 --> 00:08:34.195
Only a ha'penny each.

107
00:08:34.278 --> 00:08:37.698
I wish I could have convinced Father
to see it your way, Mr. Fishfinger.


108
00:08:37.782 --> 00:08:41.369
Yes, well, you see,
a man's got to move with the times.


109
00:08:41.452 --> 00:08:43.204
Still, when you take over the shop,

110
00:08:43.287 --> 00:08:45.414
no doubt we'll do
a lot of business together, you and I.


111
00:08:45.498 --> 00:08:47.471
That won't be for some time yet, Mr.
Fishfinger.


112
00:08:47.496 --> 00:08:49.025
Well, you never know.
Never know.


113
00:08:49.752 --> 00:08:52.421
Oh, well, it's getting late.
I'd better be going.


114
00:08:52.505 --> 00:08:54.340
Okay by me.

115
00:08:55.216 --> 00:08:57.218
Drop in any time, Dennis.

116
00:08:58.010 --> 00:08:59.678
Good-bye, Griselda.

117
00:09:25.871 --> 00:09:27.498
Father!

118
00:09:35.297 --> 00:09:38.384
- Is that you, Dennis?
- Yes, Father.


119
00:09:39.718 --> 00:09:43.139
Come closer, Dennis.

120
00:09:43.222 --> 00:09:44.306
Yes, Father.

121
00:09:49.061 --> 00:09:50.646
What happened?

122
00:09:50.729 --> 00:09:52.440
My heart.

123
00:09:53.399 --> 00:09:55.234
I haven't long.

124
00:09:57.153 --> 00:10:00.197
I'm going to... 
I'm going to...

125
00:10:00.823 --> 00:10:02.199
Throw up?

126
00:10:02.283 --> 00:10:04.201
No.

127
00:10:06.954 --> 00:10:08.664
- Oh, Father.
- Son.


128
00:10:08.747 --> 00:10:12.501
What shall I do without your guiding hand,
without your skill?


129
00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:16.172
- Son.
- Yes, Father?


130
00:10:17.548 --> 00:10:18.799
I'll tell you.

131
00:10:20.384 --> 00:10:22.636
You're going to end up just like that...

132
00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:25.681
F... F... F...

133
00:10:27.183 --> 00:10:29.059
Fishfinger.

134
00:10:29.143 --> 00:10:31.103
Who, me?

135
00:10:31.937 --> 00:10:34.982
Oh, Father, I know Mr. Fishfinger
is a very successful businessman, but...


136
00:10:37.651 --> 00:10:40.696
Because you've got no understanding

137
00:10:40.779 --> 00:10:43.824
of craftsmanship,

138
00:10:43.908 --> 00:10:48.913
no appreciation
of the beauty of the wood.


139
00:10:50.581 --> 00:10:53.042
Because you're just a shallow,

140
00:10:53.959 --> 00:10:55.920
dull, pretentious...

141
00:10:56.003 --> 00:10:57.421
- Father!
- Little...


142
00:10:57.505 --> 00:11:00.925
s-s-s-stock-taker.

143
00:11:01.008 --> 00:11:03.093
Oh, Father, you're delirious.

144
00:11:03.177 --> 00:11:05.262
- Yeah.
- You don't know what you're saying.


145
00:11:05.346 --> 00:11:08.557
Oh, yes, I do, you... you whimpering,

146
00:11:08.641 --> 00:11:13.270
snotty-nosed, cretinous oaf!

147
00:11:13.354 --> 00:11:17.358
I've wanted to say this for years.

148
00:11:17.441 --> 00:11:19.026
Father, we're not alone.

149
00:11:19.109 --> 00:11:22.196
You're everything I despise!

150
00:11:22.905 --> 00:11:24.532
Dad's raving, I'm afraid.

151
00:11:24.615 --> 00:11:27.117
No, he's not.

152
00:11:27.201 --> 00:11:32.081
You and your kind will drive
good, honest craftsmen to the wall.


153
00:11:32.164 --> 00:11:35.042
Do you hear? To the wall!

154
00:11:35.125 --> 00:11:37.545
Honestly, Dad, I was only
trying to improve the business.


155
00:11:39.588 --> 00:11:42.508
You won't have <i>my</i> business...

156
00:11:43.384 --> 00:11:45.386
to improve anymore.

157
00:11:45.469 --> 00:11:47.846
Not my cooperage.

158
00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:51.433
Because I'm... 
I'm taking it with me.

159
00:11:51.517 --> 00:11:55.145
- But, Dad, I don't understand.
- Don't understand, you damn ninny?


160
00:11:55.229 --> 00:11:59.650
I'm renouncing you. You're no son of mine.
You're no craftsman's son.


161
00:11:59.733 --> 00:12:01.110
Get out.

162
00:12:01.193 --> 00:12:03.320
Out of my sight...

163
00:12:04.488 --> 00:12:07.116
stock-taker!

164
00:12:32.516 --> 00:12:35.227
Griselda! Griselda, my angel!

165
00:12:36.103 --> 00:12:37.688
Go away. We're eating.

166
00:12:37.771 --> 00:12:38.981
Is Griselda there?

167
00:12:39.064 --> 00:12:41.483
- Is that Dennis Cooper?
- Uh, yes, sir.


168
00:12:41.567 --> 00:12:44.153
- Can I speak to Griselda?
- She's eating, Dennis.


169
00:12:44.236 --> 00:12:45.252
What do you want?

170
00:12:45.277 --> 00:12:48.264
I'm going away, Mr.
Fishfinger, to the city.


171
00:12:48.324 --> 00:12:51.785
I'm going to make good,
come back and claim Griselda's hand.


172
00:12:51.869 --> 00:12:53.662
So you will, Dennis. Good-bye.

173
00:12:55.748 --> 00:12:58.208
Griselda.
Griselda, I'm going away.


174
00:12:58.292 --> 00:13:00.461
Say something. Say anything.

175
00:13:00.544 --> 00:13:02.046
Pass the potatoes.

176
00:13:02.129 --> 00:13:04.965
I heard that!
You <i>are</i> in there, Griselda!


177
00:13:05.758 --> 00:13:08.344
My darling, I'm going away.
I may not even see you...


178
00:13:08.427 --> 00:13:11.013
That's rotten!

179
00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:16.810
For me?

180
00:13:16.894 --> 00:13:18.437
Griselda, you <i>do</i> care.

181
00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:20.648
A keepsake.

182
00:13:20.731 --> 00:13:23.317
Something that
will always remind me of you.


183
00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:27.279
Oh, Griselda, I'll carry this next to
my heart until the day when we next...


184
00:13:27.363 --> 00:13:29.365
Say good-bye to the boy, Grissy.

185
00:13:32.034 --> 00:13:33.661
Meet.

186
00:13:41.627 --> 00:13:43.379
Good-bye, Griselda.

187
00:14:23.544 --> 00:14:26.463
No, no!

188
00:14:26.547 --> 00:14:30.467
- Stay away!
- Stay away from me! No!


189
00:14:33.178 --> 00:14:36.390
No!

190
00:14:56.285 --> 00:14:58.912
What's that? What's that?

191
00:14:58.996 --> 00:15:02.166
No! Aaah! Aaah!

192
00:15:02.249 --> 00:15:05.002
Ahh.

193
00:15:15.637 --> 00:15:17.806
Good morning, Your Majesty.

194
00:15:20.601 --> 00:15:22.519
Good morning, Passelewe.

195
00:15:22.603 --> 00:15:26.148
- Good morning to you, sir!
- And to you, sir! A fine day!


196
00:15:26.231 --> 00:15:28.942
Truly.
Your business goes well, I trust.


197
00:15:29.026 --> 00:15:31.945
One doesn't like to complain.
And your own commercial efforts?


198
00:15:32.029 --> 00:15:34.323
Oh-ho!
One does one's best, you know.


199
00:15:34.406 --> 00:15:36.492
I understand you're opening a new shop.

200
00:15:36.575 --> 00:15:39.495
Yes, down by the town gate.
It's an area of considerable growth.


201
00:15:39.578 --> 00:15:42.956
Oh, I agree. I trust we'll be
hearing from you with an order soon.


202
00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:45.959
Oh, certainly. That is, if your prices
are as competitive as they were.


203
00:15:46.043 --> 00:15:47.753
Ah, surely.

204
00:15:47.836 --> 00:15:49.796
By the way,
what's the latest wine-to-water ratio?


205
00:15:49.838 --> 00:15:52.438
- Did you see it this morning?
- It came just as I left the house.


206
00:15:52.466 --> 00:15:55.761
It's two wine to one water still, but I
don't see how it can hold at that rate.


207
00:15:55.844 --> 00:15:58.222
They're very lucky to be
getting any wine at all, you know.


208
00:15:58.305 --> 00:15:59.515
Is that all?

209
00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:03.167
I thought I detected a certain wanness
in the last consignment you sent me.


210
00:16:03.227 --> 00:16:06.396
Oh, that's odd. It was very robust
when it left my premises.


211
00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:08.148
Get a move on.

212
00:16:08.232 --> 00:16:11.568
Let me send you a sample of our new
shipment of port with my compliments.


213
00:16:11.652 --> 00:16:13.278
Move it, you lame buggers.

214
00:16:13.362 --> 00:16:15.280
That would be most kind of you.

215
00:16:15.364 --> 00:16:17.574
Why do you suppose the king
has called this council?


216
00:16:17.658 --> 00:16:20.285
Only the Lord knows...
Get going, you.


217
00:16:20.369 --> 00:16:23.889
But I have heard that the chamberlain is urging
him to take measures against the monster.


218
00:16:23.914 --> 00:16:27.292
Measures? That would allow
the peasants to leave the city?


219
00:16:27.376 --> 00:16:30.170
It could very well be.
And that would not be good for business.


220
00:16:30.254 --> 00:16:31.797
Move it, you slugs! Move!

221
00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:35.300
- Come on!
- Get a move on!


222
00:16:35.384 --> 00:16:37.678
Come on! Move!

223
00:16:37.761 --> 00:16:40.264
Come on! Move it!

224
00:16:47.604 --> 00:16:49.982
Dig in! Come on!

225
00:16:50.065 --> 00:16:53.068
Stop!

226
00:17:03.495 --> 00:17:05.789
- After you.
- No, you first. Please.


227
00:17:05.873 --> 00:17:07.291
You're too kind.

228
00:17:56.506 --> 00:17:59.718
Attention!

229
00:17:59.801 --> 00:18:01.803
Your Most Glorious Majesty,

230
00:18:01.887 --> 00:18:04.348
King Bruno the Questionable...

231
00:18:10.562 --> 00:18:14.608
son of Olaf the Loud.

232
00:18:14.691 --> 00:18:17.235
Oh! he's coming! H
-He's coming!

233
00:18:17.319 --> 00:18:21.114
- I'm not finished yet.
- Oh, look out! He's here!


234
00:18:21.198 --> 00:18:22.950
Oh! Aah!

235
00:18:27.454 --> 00:18:29.581
Your Majesty.

236
00:18:29.665 --> 00:18:31.708
Do pay attention, Your Majesty.

237
00:18:31.792 --> 00:18:35.003
Surely you must see
it's a matter of the gravest urgency.


238
00:18:35.087 --> 00:18:37.965
- Yes. Yes, of course, Passelewe.
- Jesus Christ!


239
00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:42.552
Quick, sire, down!

240
00:18:46.598 --> 00:18:48.684
Stop it!

241
00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:52.354
Go on.

242
00:18:54.606 --> 00:18:56.191
Bless my soul.

243
00:18:56.274 --> 00:19:01.238
Great-grand-nephew

244
00:19:01.321 --> 00:19:04.074
of Emperor Otto the Bent...

245
00:19:06.076 --> 00:19:09.162
conqueror...

246
00:19:11.081 --> 00:19:12.582
of Freedonia.

247
00:19:12.666 --> 00:19:15.460
- Let him go!
- Get up, man.


248
00:19:15.544 --> 00:19:19.131
Silly thing.
You'll get your rags all dirty.


249
00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:23.135
Sire. Help us, sire.

250
00:19:23.218 --> 00:19:25.887
The monster is ravaging the countryside.

251
00:19:25.971 --> 00:19:28.348
It has destroyed our homes.

252
00:19:28.432 --> 00:19:30.559
W
-We haven't eaten in days.

253
00:19:30.642 --> 00:19:32.144
- Weeks.
- Months.


254
00:19:32.227 --> 00:19:34.438
E
-Except I et my shoe yesterday.

255
00:19:34.521 --> 00:19:39.860
Oh, that's nothin'. I et three toes
off of my, um... right foot.


256
00:19:39.943 --> 00:19:42.904
- Terrible monster which...
- That ain't your right foot.


257
00:19:42.988 --> 00:19:45.490
Know-it-all.
Are you a doctor or summat?


258
00:19:45.574 --> 00:19:47.909
- But please...
- I saw a doctor once.


259
00:19:47.993 --> 00:19:50.829
He didn't see me.
I was hiding.


260
00:19:50.912 --> 00:19:53.081
Y
-Your Majesty,

261
00:19:53.165 --> 00:19:55.500
save us from the great, green beast.

262
00:19:55.584 --> 00:19:58.503
- Gray!
- The side I saw was a dirty yellow.


263
00:19:58.587 --> 00:20:01.506
- No, it were more orange-y.
- No, it was gray!


264
00:20:05.218 --> 00:20:07.012
What... Now stop it.

265
00:20:08.013 --> 00:20:10.766
Stop it, all of you!
Go on, get out, get out, get out.


266
00:20:10.849 --> 00:20:13.351
What are you doing?
Go on, get out.


267
00:20:13.435 --> 00:20:15.729
I'll read this to the king.

268
00:20:15.812 --> 00:20:18.023
Stop it! Go on!

269
00:20:20.192 --> 00:20:22.110
You know, it seems to me, Passelewe,

270
00:20:22.194 --> 00:20:24.946
that my subjects
are becoming a pain in the arse.


271
00:20:25.030 --> 00:20:27.657
Yes, well, my dear,
you must do something.


272
00:20:27.741 --> 00:20:30.160
I mean, your kingdom
is paralyzed with fear.


273
00:20:30.243 --> 00:20:32.287
The city below
is overflowing with refugees.


274
00:20:32.370 --> 00:20:34.289
I mean, they're simple people, Bruno,

275
00:20:34.372 --> 00:20:37.375
and easy prey for every
sharp-witted merchant and trickster.


276
00:20:37.459 --> 00:20:39.586
Past Grand Master,
Royal Order of Lowndes,


277
00:20:39.669 --> 00:20:41.838
Victor, Savior of Wales.

278
00:20:44.549 --> 00:20:46.676
- Hey!
- Thank you.


279
00:21:08.615 --> 00:21:13.203
Your Majesty, your council meets today
in solemn session


280
00:21:13.286 --> 00:21:18.333
to urgently discuss the terrible havoc
wreaked by the monster


281
00:21:18.416 --> 00:21:20.335
<i>all over the countryside.</i>

282
00:21:20.418 --> 00:21:22.379
Look, I'm telling ya,

283
00:21:22.462 --> 00:21:24.923
nobody gets in here
without money or possessions.


284
00:21:25.006 --> 00:21:26.550
But I've got possessions.

285
00:21:26.633 --> 00:21:29.261
- See?
- Ah, that's only a rock.


286
00:21:29.344 --> 00:21:31.054
- Only a rock?
- Yeah.


287
00:21:31.138 --> 00:21:34.933
Listen. What if this is not
just an ordinary rock?


288
00:21:35.016 --> 00:21:38.353
What if this is a diamond?

289
00:21:38.436 --> 00:21:41.064
It don't shine.
Now get outta here!


290
00:21:41.148 --> 00:21:43.400
Get outta here! 
Get outta here!

291
00:21:43.483 --> 00:21:46.403
Right. Next. What have you got?

292
00:21:46.486 --> 00:21:48.989
Any grain? Any cloth?

293
00:21:49.072 --> 00:21:50.740
Uh, no, I haven't got anything, really.

294
00:21:50.824 --> 00:21:52.778
But it's very important
that I get in the city.


295
00:21:52.803 --> 00:21:54.268
Yeah, that's what they all say.

296
00:21:54.327 --> 00:21:56.287
- Now, move along.
- No, no, you don't understand.


297
00:21:56.329 --> 00:21:58.832
I've come to get a job.
I'm starting all over again.


298
00:21:58.915 --> 00:22:01.585
I've got lots of good ideas,
and I think that once in there I could...


299
00:22:01.668 --> 00:22:03.670
Now, look, sonny. 
Shove off, eh?

300
00:22:03.753 --> 00:22:06.590
Wait a minute. 
What have you got here?

301
00:22:06.673 --> 00:22:08.341
What's this?

302
00:22:09.426 --> 00:22:11.970
You told us you had nothing.

303
00:22:12.053 --> 00:22:14.389
- Cor!
- That's not for eating.


304
00:22:14.472 --> 00:22:17.767
What do you mean?
You could last for a week on that.


305
00:22:18.935 --> 00:22:22.022
Just a minute.
What are you up to, sonny?


306
00:22:22.105 --> 00:22:24.149
Oh, nothing, nothing.
It's a memento.


307
00:22:24.941 --> 00:22:26.151
A memento?

308
00:22:27.611 --> 00:22:29.613
My sweetheart gave it to me
before I left home.


309
00:22:29.696 --> 00:22:32.032
She gave you that?

310
00:22:32.115 --> 00:22:34.868
Yes. Can I have it back, please?

311
00:22:35.744 --> 00:22:38.455
Gosh, she must really love you.

312
00:22:38.538 --> 00:22:40.749
- Do you really think so?
- Yeah.


313
00:22:40.832 --> 00:22:45.003
I've got a sort of sticky feeling inside me
just thinking of it.


314
00:22:45.086 --> 00:22:46.922
You sure are a lucky guy.

315
00:22:47.005 --> 00:22:48.965
Come on, Fred, cut it out!

316
00:22:49.049 --> 00:22:51.301
- He's not getting in.
- I've got to!


317
00:22:51.384 --> 00:22:54.012
- Give him a break. Just this once.
- No chance.


318
00:22:54.095 --> 00:22:55.430
Now push off, you.

319
00:23:03.438 --> 00:23:05.232
Just 'cause he's got a potato...

320
00:23:05.315 --> 00:23:08.360
Look, I'm telling you,
that's what they all say.


321
00:23:08.443 --> 00:23:10.737
Wait a minute. Hey, you!

322
00:23:12.405 --> 00:23:13.615
Come back!

323
00:23:18.161 --> 00:23:19.371
That's far enough!

324
00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:24.334
Let's have a look at your legs.

325
00:23:40.392 --> 00:23:41.476
No.

326
00:23:41.559 --> 00:23:43.561
Next!

327
00:23:49.234 --> 00:23:51.069
And so, Your Majesty,

328
00:23:51.152 --> 00:23:56.241
your
great-great-great-great-great-grandfather,


329
00:23:56.324 --> 00:23:58.660
King Max the Vainglorious,

330
00:23:58.743 --> 00:24:00.287
by a tournament

331
00:24:00.370 --> 00:24:05.500
chose from his knights a champion
to free the kingdom from the pestilence.


332
00:24:05.583 --> 00:24:09.879
"Mounted on his mighty charger,
Sir Bromiades waged ..."


333
00:24:16.136 --> 00:24:18.096
What's that?

334
00:24:18.179 --> 00:24:21.057
Quickly, man.
Somebody might be trying to poison me.


335
00:24:25.562 --> 00:24:27.439
Plaster, Your Majesty.

336
00:24:27.522 --> 00:24:30.066
Oh. Carry on, Passelewe.

337
00:24:30.150 --> 00:24:33.445
- "Mounted on his, uh, 11th ..."
- Wait.


338
00:24:34.779 --> 00:24:36.990
- "Mounted on his mighty ..."
- No, wait.


339
00:24:37.073 --> 00:24:39.242
- Twelfth century, I think.
- Shut up!


340
00:24:40.327 --> 00:24:43.371
Fool. Carry on, Passelewe.

341
00:24:43.455 --> 00:24:47.334
"Until peace was once more
restored to the kingdom.


342
00:24:47.417 --> 00:24:51.504
With that, King Max rode back
to the cheers of his subjects,


343
00:24:51.588 --> 00:24:54.257
who lined the road for over 50 miles."

344
00:24:54.883 --> 00:24:56.634
Fifty miles?

345
00:24:56.718 --> 00:24:59.471
You mean they cheered him
all that way?


346
00:24:59.554 --> 00:25:01.181
Wow.

347
00:25:01.264 --> 00:25:03.892
They certainly must have respected him.

348
00:25:05.101 --> 00:25:08.229
You're right, Passelewe.
We'll hold a tournament.


349
00:25:08.313 --> 00:25:12.692
It's years since we heard
the clash of sword against shield,


350
00:25:12.776 --> 00:25:16.654
the clamor of mightily armored knights
crashing to the ground,


351
00:25:16.738 --> 00:25:21.659
the spurt of blood as the dagger is thrust
into unprotected groin.


352
00:25:21.743 --> 00:25:23.495
Oh, no.

353
00:25:23.578 --> 00:25:25.413
Oh, no, dear. No, no, no, no.

354
00:25:25.497 --> 00:25:29.876
What I had in mind was a...
was a tournament <i>à plaisance.</i>


355
00:25:31.378 --> 00:25:33.463
<i>À plaisance?</i>

356
00:25:33.546 --> 00:25:37.634
Passelewe, do my ear holes hear right?

357
00:25:37.717 --> 00:25:42.263
<i>À plaisance,</i> with blunted sword
and collared lance?


358
00:25:42.347 --> 00:25:44.933
Where's the honor in that?

359
00:25:45.016 --> 00:25:49.145
Where's the glory in a bunch of buffoons
playing pillow fights, eh?


360
00:25:49.229 --> 00:25:53.233
No, it must be <i>l'outrance.</i>

361
00:25:53.316 --> 00:25:54.567
To the death.

362
00:25:54.651 --> 00:25:57.695
- Please, Bruno, please.
- No, no, no.


363
00:25:57.779 --> 00:26:00.907
Go with all speed
and make the arrangements.


364
00:26:00.990 --> 00:26:04.536
I can't wait to tell the princess.

365
00:26:17.173 --> 00:26:19.342
Daughter?

366
00:26:20.009 --> 00:26:23.596
Still working hard, I see.

367
00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:27.517
You and the blessed sisters of misery.

368
00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:28.810
Well...

369
00:26:29.978 --> 00:26:31.813
what are you making, Daughter?

370
00:26:31.896 --> 00:26:36.568
A tapestry, Father, depicting
the famous siege of Castle Apcadwallader.


371
00:26:36.651 --> 00:26:38.278
See?

372
00:26:38.361 --> 00:26:41.614
In this portion,
the king is eating his horse


373
00:26:41.698 --> 00:26:43.908
on the 98th day of the siege.

374
00:26:43.992 --> 00:26:46.411
Splendid!

375
00:26:47.829 --> 00:26:50.373
Very pretty, Daughter.
Yes, but you were always...


376
00:26:52.333 --> 00:26:55.837
Careful, Father.
Sister Winnet fell out last week.


377
00:26:58.506 --> 00:27:03.011
Daughter, our kingdom
will soon be free of the monster.


378
00:27:03.094 --> 00:27:07.015
I have declared a tournament
to find a champion to destroy it.


379
00:27:07.098 --> 00:27:09.058
What, the kingdom?

380
00:27:09.142 --> 00:27:11.603
Oh, no, of course not, silly.
No, the monster.


381
00:27:12.312 --> 00:27:14.397
Oh! I see.

382
00:27:14.481 --> 00:27:16.274
Yes, and not only that,

383
00:27:16.357 --> 00:27:19.861
but the successful knight
will win your hand in marriage.


384
00:27:20.904 --> 00:27:22.739
Marriage?

385
00:27:22.822 --> 00:27:27.035
Yes, well, you want to be married, surely?

386
00:27:27.118 --> 00:27:29.120
- Of course I do, Daddy.
- Well, then...


387
00:27:29.204 --> 00:27:33.082
But I want to marry a prince.
I'm supposed to marry a prince.


388
00:27:33.166 --> 00:27:36.794
That's why I wait in this tower,
just like all the books say to do.


389
00:27:37.504 --> 00:27:40.131
Are any of the contestants princes?

390
00:27:42.133 --> 00:27:44.761
Well, not exactly.

391
00:27:45.887 --> 00:27:47.222
- No?
- No.


392
00:27:47.305 --> 00:27:50.141
- But I could make one a prince, couldn't I?
- No.


393
00:27:50.225 --> 00:27:52.685
- No, I mean, the winner.
- It's not the same.


394
00:27:52.769 --> 00:27:55.230
No, not really.

395
00:27:56.231 --> 00:27:57.732
Ah, well, never mind.

396
00:27:57.815 --> 00:27:59.567
Once the monster is destroyed,

397
00:27:59.651 --> 00:28:02.946
I will build you a beautiful bridal suite

398
00:28:03.029 --> 00:28:05.156
in the lovely West Tower.

399
00:28:16.125 --> 00:28:18.294
On second thought,

400
00:28:18.378 --> 00:28:23.383
I think the view from the lovely <i>East</i> Tower
would be infinitely more preferable.


401
00:28:23.466 --> 00:28:26.135
Hmm?

402
00:29:10.471 --> 00:29:12.890
- Who is it?
- Uh, excuse me.


403
00:29:12.974 --> 00:29:14.350
Watch him. Watch him.

404
00:29:14.434 --> 00:29:16.853
I wonder if I could have
some of your soup?


405
00:29:16.936 --> 00:29:19.564
He's after our soup.

406
00:29:19.647 --> 00:29:21.357
- Somebody stop him!
- Poke a hole in 'im!


407
00:29:22.817 --> 00:29:24.569
- I'll do anything.
- Anything?


408
00:29:24.652 --> 00:29:27.697
- Will he gather firewood?
- I don't know. What do you think?


409
00:29:27.780 --> 00:29:29.866
I think we should
poke a hole in 'im.

410
00:29:29.949 --> 00:29:33.494
I'll collect some firewood for you
if you let me have some of your soup.


411
00:29:33.578 --> 00:29:35.371
Where do I get it from?

412
00:29:44.464 --> 00:29:46.174
Ah.

413
00:29:46.257 --> 00:29:47.717
Oh. Um...

414
00:29:50.136 --> 00:29:54.307
Well... could I have a little taste of the
soup first, just to see if I like it?


415
00:29:54.390 --> 00:29:56.809
No, I thought not.

416
00:29:59.937 --> 00:30:01.939
Well, I'd better go then.

417
00:30:02.023 --> 00:30:04.275
The firewood, was it?

418
00:30:04.359 --> 00:30:06.861
Uh... yes.

419
00:30:59.288 --> 00:31:01.874
So, you've discovered
my diamond mine, have you?


420
00:31:01.958 --> 00:31:04.168
- No. I was just gathering firewood.
- Liar!


421
00:31:04.252 --> 00:31:06.379
It's the diamonds you're after, isn't it?

422
00:31:06.462 --> 00:31:08.464
These are not diamonds.
They're just rocks.


423
00:31:08.548 --> 00:31:09.716
Just rocks?

424
00:31:12.343 --> 00:31:13.803
Quick thinking.

425
00:31:13.886 --> 00:31:16.305
But not quick enough
to save your skin.


426
00:31:16.389 --> 00:31:19.976
The secret of my diamond mine
dies with you!


427
00:31:50.381 --> 00:31:53.968
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

428
00:31:54.051 --> 00:31:57.597
I just dropped in to tell you
to, uh, start without me.


429
00:31:59.223 --> 00:32:02.393
Perhaps another night.

430
00:32:21.746 --> 00:32:22.830
Huh?

431
00:32:41.641 --> 00:32:43.059
Huh?

432
00:33:04.330 --> 00:33:08.584
Hey! Hey! Oi! Oi! 
Hold on there!

433
00:33:08.668 --> 00:33:11.087
Open up! Open the door!

434
00:33:11.170 --> 00:33:13.256
Open it up! Open up in there!

435
00:33:13.339 --> 00:33:16.259
Oi! Open it! Open the door!

436
00:33:17.218 --> 00:33:19.136
Open the door!

437
00:34:05.016 --> 00:34:06.893
Rush hour!

438
00:34:32.668 --> 00:34:35.504
Harken, before it is too late!

439
00:34:35.588 --> 00:34:37.340
Prepare!

440
00:34:38.132 --> 00:34:42.053
Cleanse yourselves!
The beast is at the gates!


441
00:34:42.136 --> 00:34:44.138
Prepare yourselves!

442
00:34:45.431 --> 00:34:47.767
The beast is at the gates!

443
00:34:49.894 --> 00:34:51.729
Cleanse yourselves!

444
00:34:55.399 --> 00:34:56.901
Prepare!

445
00:34:56.984 --> 00:34:59.820
The beast is at the gates!

446
00:35:00.905 --> 00:35:03.449
Cleanse yourselves!

447
00:35:04.241 --> 00:35:07.203
All citizens, listen to me!

448
00:35:07.286 --> 00:35:09.580
Yeah, you better listen!

449
00:35:09.664 --> 00:35:11.457
You'd better bloody listen!

450
00:35:12.291 --> 00:35:15.169
- Are you listening up?
- Listen up! Listen up!


451
00:35:15.252 --> 00:35:17.004
You'd better listen up!

452
00:35:17.088 --> 00:35:19.048
Shut up!

453
00:35:19.131 --> 00:35:21.968
You never listen.

454
00:35:22.051 --> 00:35:25.012
- Sin!
- Sin! Sin!


455
00:35:25.096 --> 00:35:27.139
Yes, the bristling spikes
of the pondylus.


456
00:35:27.223 --> 00:35:28.265
The pondylus!

457
00:35:28.349 --> 00:35:30.434
The pointed crests of the dactylopters.

458
00:35:30.518 --> 00:35:31.769
The dactylopters!

459
00:35:31.852 --> 00:35:33.896
- The trigla.
- The trigla!


460
00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:36.065
<i>♪ And the flying hogfish ♪</i>

461
00:35:36.148 --> 00:35:39.318
<i>♪ And the flying hogfish ♪</i>

462
00:35:39.402 --> 00:35:45.199
Are as nothing compared to
the beast that holds us prisoner!


463
00:35:45.282 --> 00:35:47.618
The beast that...

464
00:35:47.702 --> 00:35:49.245
Flying hogfish?

465
00:35:51.247 --> 00:35:53.833
I seen a gliding hogfish once.

466
00:35:53.916 --> 00:35:55.835
Never flying.

467
00:35:55.918 --> 00:35:57.670
Not actually flying.

468
00:36:10.725 --> 00:36:12.351
Cabbages.

469
00:36:13.477 --> 00:36:14.687
Cabbages.

470
00:36:14.770 --> 00:36:18.065
Rats killed, lady.
All very tidy.


471
00:36:18.149 --> 00:36:19.817
All very quiet.

472
00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:21.444
- Morning.
- Oh, morning.


473
00:36:21.527 --> 00:36:25.239
- I'm afraid I haven't got any money.
- Oh. Oh, that's all right.


474
00:36:25.322 --> 00:36:28.117
Thank you, guv... Oh! Thank you.

475
00:36:28.868 --> 00:36:30.244
Thank you.

476
00:36:30.327 --> 00:36:31.912
Is that yours?

477
00:36:31.996 --> 00:36:33.789
Of course it is.

478
00:36:33.873 --> 00:36:35.666
Whose did you think it was?

479
00:36:36.417 --> 00:36:38.627
- You're new to the city?
- Uh, yes. Yes.


480
00:36:38.711 --> 00:36:41.630
I came here from the country
to start a new life here, get a job.


481
00:36:41.714 --> 00:36:44.508
A job? No chance, son.

482
00:36:44.592 --> 00:36:45.968
Oh, thank you, guv'nor.

483
00:36:46.052 --> 00:36:49.013
Well, surely there must be
plenty of opportunities.


484
00:36:49.096 --> 00:36:51.515
Morning. Thank you.

485
00:36:51.599 --> 00:36:53.893
I am a qualified cooper's apprentice.

486
00:36:54.935 --> 00:36:57.104
A cooper's apprentice.

487
00:36:57.188 --> 00:36:59.482
Well, what a coincidence.

488
00:36:59.565 --> 00:37:01.567
I'm a cooper myself.

489
00:37:01.650 --> 00:37:04.904
You may even have heard of me.
Wat Dabney.


490
00:37:05.613 --> 00:37:07.615
Wat Dabney?

491
00:37:07.698 --> 00:37:09.825
Not <i>the</i> Wat Dabney.

492
00:37:09.909 --> 00:37:13.079
- The inventor of the inverted firkin?
- The very same, lad.


493
00:37:13.162 --> 00:37:15.206
- Cor!
- Now...


494
00:37:15.289 --> 00:37:18.501
if I can't get a job here,
what chance have you got?


495
00:37:18.584 --> 00:37:20.211
Come here. Here.

496
00:37:21.629 --> 00:37:24.632
You see that plaque?
There. Under the barrel.


497
00:37:24.715 --> 00:37:27.384
- Oh, yeah.
- Well, that's a guild sign.


498
00:37:28.094 --> 00:37:30.846
To work there you've got to be
a member of the guild.


499
00:37:31.764 --> 00:37:34.100
But you're not and I'm not.

500
00:37:34.183 --> 00:37:36.143
And not likely to be.

501
00:37:36.227 --> 00:37:37.561
But that's not fair.

502
00:37:37.645 --> 00:37:40.397
Fair or not, the guilds
have this town sewn up.


503
00:37:40.481 --> 00:37:41.941
Morning.

504
00:37:42.024 --> 00:37:43.943
But what am I gonna do?

505
00:37:44.026 --> 00:37:47.279
Well, it's no good going round
with a long face, is it?


506
00:37:47.363 --> 00:37:49.573
I did for weeks. 
Nearly starved.

507
00:37:49.657 --> 00:37:52.284
Then, only this morning
I thought of this.


508
00:37:54.578 --> 00:37:56.205
Hey.

509
00:37:57.248 --> 00:37:59.792
Maybe we could team up together.

510
00:38:00.918 --> 00:38:02.503
Sure.

511
00:38:02.586 --> 00:38:05.005
- All you gotta do is...
- No. No, thank you.


512
00:38:05.089 --> 00:38:08.008
No, no, good-bye.
I think it's a one-man business, really.


513
00:38:08.676 --> 00:38:12.263
Well, what a golden chance he's missing.

514
00:38:41.792 --> 00:38:44.628
Attention!
Attention, ladies and gentlemen!


515
00:38:44.712 --> 00:38:47.339
Your attention, please!

516
00:38:47.423 --> 00:38:52.052

Excuse me. Um... please?

00:39:31.842 --> 00:39:33.052
Thank you very much.

528

531
00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:58.827
Correction.
It is, of course...


532
00:39:58.911 --> 00:40:02.915
It is, of course, the king's hand
and half the princess's kingdom.


533
00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:07.378
Excuse me.

534
00:40:07.461 --> 00:40:09.546
Yes. Yes.

535
00:40:10.547 --> 00:40:13.133
Yes. Yes, I see. Thank you. Thank you.

536
00:40:13.217 --> 00:40:16.762
I've just received final confirmation
of the final terms.


537
00:40:16.845 --> 00:40:19.765
It is, of course, the <i>princess's</i> hand

538
00:40:19.848 --> 00:40:23.143
and half the entire kingdom.

539
00:42:17.466 --> 00:42:21.261
Beware the Jabberwock, my son.

540
00:42:21.345 --> 00:42:23.764
- Cabbages. Cabbages.
- The jaws that bite.


541
00:42:23.847 --> 00:42:25.849
- The claws that catch.
- Could I have one for nothing?


542
00:42:25.933 --> 00:42:27.476
Go on. Get off.

543
00:44:12.164 --> 00:44:15.792
Hot roasted rats! 
Only a farthing!

544
00:44:16.418 --> 00:44:17.836
Rats on a stick!

545
00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:21.215
In a very short time one of you
is going to be the lucky owner of this egg!


546
00:44:21.298 --> 00:44:23.675
Get 'em hot!

547
00:44:23.759 --> 00:44:26.011
There you are, sonny.
Off you go then.


548
00:44:27.262 --> 00:44:30.641
Get your rats! 
Only a farthing!

549
00:44:30.724 --> 00:44:34.311
Turnips. Turnips.
Get your tur... Get your turnips here.


550
00:44:34.394 --> 00:44:37.231
Turnips. Turnips. 
Get your turnips.

551
00:44:59.044 --> 00:45:00.462
I want it!

552
00:45:14.977 --> 00:45:17.020
Jesus Christ!

553
00:45:20.148 --> 00:45:22.943
I'm awfully sorry.
I only wanted a bite of turnip.


554
00:45:23.026 --> 00:45:24.695
Just keep walking.

555
00:45:25.737 --> 00:45:29.950
Oh! Hold up one minute, sir.
I'll have you out in two shakes.


556
00:45:30.033 --> 00:45:31.660
I'm on it, really.

557
00:45:35.289 --> 00:45:36.915
How about that, then?

558
00:45:36.999 --> 00:45:40.919
First-class service as advertised.
Don't forget. Tell your friends.


559
00:45:45.257 --> 00:45:48.218
- Where do you want it?
- Over there by the burnishing pit.


560
00:45:48.302 --> 00:45:50.387
Over there by the burnishing pit!

561
00:45:50.470 --> 00:45:52.514
I suppose you want
this lot due in today?

562
00:45:52.598 --> 00:45:54.516
What happened?
A tree fall on him?


563
00:45:57.853 --> 00:45:59.479
All right up there, are you?

564
00:46:02.065 --> 00:46:05.611
You the master armorer here?
Just look at this arm brace.


565
00:46:05.694 --> 00:46:07.529
You call that workmanship?

566
00:46:07.613 --> 00:46:10.073
- I can't do...
- And look at this damned bar!


567
00:46:10.157 --> 00:46:12.868
What's wrong with it?

568
00:46:12.951 --> 00:46:14.995
You can't please some people.
They want miracles.


569
00:46:15.078 --> 00:46:18.332
- I said the best Italian armor.
- Yes, but them arm braces I sent for...


570
00:46:18.415 --> 00:46:21.960
I don't want to hear it.
You said Friday afternoon.


571
00:46:22.044 --> 00:46:24.884
- And to me that means Friday afternoon!
- Don't be impatient.


572
00:46:24.963 --> 00:46:28.592
- I put three of my best men on the job.
- No good! No good!


573
00:46:28.675 --> 00:46:30.886
- Here...
- Get back!


574
00:46:30.969 --> 00:46:32.846
Come on, boys. Come on.

575
00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:36.725
And don't bother sending a bill either.

576
00:46:51.657 --> 00:46:52.949
Excuse me.

577
00:46:57.663 --> 00:47:00.248
Excuse me!
I couldn't help noticing...


578
00:47:00.332 --> 00:47:01.792
Get outta here!

579
00:47:03.710 --> 00:47:06.546
I couldn't help noticing
that you could increase your efficiency


580
00:47:06.630 --> 00:47:08.256
if you moved your box to here.

581
00:47:54.344 --> 00:47:56.471
Yeah!

582
00:48:03.186 --> 00:48:05.147
Clumsy idiot!

583
00:48:05.230 --> 00:48:07.733
- Come on. Let's get out of here.
- I was just trying to improve his efficiency.


584
00:48:07.816 --> 00:48:10.569
- You did it beautifully. Beautiful!
- What about him?


585
00:48:10.652 --> 00:48:13.780
Come on! I'll buy you a drink!

586
00:48:13.864 --> 00:48:15.866
We'll go to the Queen's Hemorrhoids, lad.

587
00:48:20.412 --> 00:48:22.831
- Mmm.
- That better?


588
00:48:22.914 --> 00:48:24.166
Oh, yes.

589
00:48:24.249 --> 00:48:27.210
- I can't remember when I ate last.
- Yes, I know.


590
00:48:27.294 --> 00:48:30.172
I once went without food for 147 days.

591
00:48:30.964 --> 00:48:32.424
147 days?

592
00:48:32.507 --> 00:48:35.093
Yeah, the winter of '52.
The siege of Caerlaverock.


593
00:48:35.177 --> 00:48:38.680
Food was so short... What's the matter?
You got a stomachache or something?


594
00:48:38.764 --> 00:48:42.726
Oh, no. No, no, I was just trying to work
out what my next move would be, that's all.


595
00:48:42.809 --> 00:48:44.311
Yeah, so was I.

596
00:48:44.394 --> 00:48:46.813
What? Geez, why worry?

597
00:48:46.897 --> 00:48:48.523
But I've got to worry.

598
00:48:48.607 --> 00:48:51.651
It's a very big step coming from a
small village to a big city like this.


599
00:48:51.735 --> 00:48:53.153
Don't I know!

600
00:48:53.236 --> 00:48:56.823
That's what attracted me
to the life of a squire... the traveling.


601
00:48:56.907 --> 00:48:59.326
One day you're out in Hertford
hunting heretics,


602
00:48:59.409 --> 00:49:03.538
the next day up in Scotland
being burned at the stake.


603
00:49:03.622 --> 00:49:05.373
It's the adventure.

604
00:49:06.041 --> 00:49:07.959
Like the time me and my knights

605
00:49:08.043 --> 00:49:10.462
was fighting
the Blessed Sisters of St. Alopecia.


606
00:49:10.545 --> 00:49:12.881
A band of warrior nuns. 
They really...

607
00:49:12.964 --> 00:49:16.343
It sounds very exciting, yes.
But how secure is it?


608
00:49:16.426 --> 00:49:18.386
- Now, you take coopering.
- Coopering?


609
00:49:18.470 --> 00:49:20.388
Coopering!

610
00:49:20.472 --> 00:49:22.891
Hell, that's no life for a man!

611
00:49:22.974 --> 00:49:26.186
It is too!
Barrels and casks are very important.


612
00:49:26.269 --> 00:49:28.146
- Now, in commerce...
- Commerce?


613
00:49:29.022 --> 00:49:30.649
Rubbish!

614
00:49:30.732 --> 00:49:32.734
Now, you listen to me.

615
00:49:32.818 --> 00:49:34.986
My knight was wounded, see,

616
00:49:35.070 --> 00:49:37.239
and there was I with
my back to the wall,

617
00:49:37.322 --> 00:49:40.700
two whacking great nuns
coming at me with maces.


618
00:49:40.784 --> 00:49:43.384
Well, I hardly think fighting nuns
is a very respectable way to...


619
00:49:43.411 --> 00:49:45.747
Here! I'll show you! Come here!

620
00:49:45.831 --> 00:49:48.542
There. You try. Come at me. Put up!

621
00:49:48.625 --> 00:49:50.919
- Pretend that drumstick is a mace.
- I don't...


622
00:49:51.002 --> 00:49:53.088
Oh, come on.

623
00:49:53.713 --> 00:49:55.882
Really let me have it. Hmm?

624
00:49:55.966 --> 00:49:57.300
- Come on.
- I can't.


625
00:49:57.384 --> 00:49:59.886
Go for me! Hyah! 
I deflected the mace!

626
00:50:02.722 --> 00:50:04.683
Then I grabbed her like this!

627
00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:07.686
- I want you to talk to the landlord for me.
- What?


628
00:50:07.769 --> 00:50:10.230
Then I threw her again, like that!

629
00:50:11.106 --> 00:50:13.692
- I want you to distract him.
- What for?


630
00:50:13.775 --> 00:50:17.028
You berk! She was tough, see.
But I grabbed her in the old‒


631
00:50:17.112 --> 00:50:18.864
- Ooh!
- Just keep him talking.


632
00:50:18.947 --> 00:50:21.241
- I don't understand.
- You will.


633
00:50:21.324 --> 00:50:23.702
Just do it!

634
00:50:23.785 --> 00:50:26.413
Now, here comes the best part.

635
00:50:26.496 --> 00:50:29.249
She broke my grip, see.
She was coming in for the kill!


636
00:50:29.332 --> 00:50:31.418
Aah! When...

637
00:50:31.501 --> 00:50:36.006
I turned tail and ran for it,
slamming shut the castle doors!


638
00:50:36.089 --> 00:50:37.382
I barred them with a lance!

639
00:50:37.465 --> 00:50:40.594
Grabbing one of the novices
as a hostage...


640
00:50:42.470 --> 00:50:45.599
I fought my way up to the battlements,

641
00:50:45.682 --> 00:50:48.018
hacking and slashing as I went!

642
00:50:48.101 --> 00:50:50.770
Voilà! In tears! In cuts!

643
00:50:53.106 --> 00:50:55.483
Easily outdistancing the enemy...

644
00:50:56.359 --> 00:50:57.819
I escaped.

645
00:51:13.168 --> 00:51:15.337
What the bloody... Open this! Boy!

646
00:51:16.338 --> 00:51:19.257
Open it up! Open it up!

647
00:51:19.341 --> 00:51:21.676
Boy.

648
00:51:23.219 --> 00:51:25.055
What the bloody hell?

649
00:51:33.939 --> 00:51:36.066
All right, let's have a bit
of decorum here.


650
00:51:49.287 --> 00:51:52.749
- What do you want?
- Uh, well, I was just wondering if, um...


651
00:51:52.832 --> 00:51:54.183
Well, speak up.
I'm a busy man.


652
00:51:54.208 --> 00:51:56.402
Yes, that's what I wanted
to talk to you about.


653
00:51:56.461 --> 00:52:00.131
Um, I used to be a cooper's apprentice,
and I was, uh...


654
00:52:00.215 --> 00:52:02.968
All right, coming up right away.
Well, what is it, boy? Spit it out.


655
00:52:03.051 --> 00:52:06.596
I j-just wondered whether you could tell me
something about the inn-keeping business.


656
00:52:06.680 --> 00:52:09.182
- Is there a way to change trades...
- What, now?


657
00:52:09.265 --> 00:52:13.228
Mr. Rotcod,
the party in the corner is still waiting.


658
00:52:13.311 --> 00:52:16.314
Tell them it's coming up right away.
Just go away. I've got no time.


659
00:52:16.398 --> 00:52:19.484
Perhaps it would help
if you'd put the pitcher of ale over here


660
00:52:19.567 --> 00:52:21.361
and the jar of mead over here.

661
00:52:21.444 --> 00:52:24.447
'Cause I couldn't help noticing
you were impairing your efficiency by...


662
00:52:24.531 --> 00:52:26.741
Christ's kidneys.
Will you get out of my way!


663
00:52:26.825 --> 00:52:28.827
Here, Betty.
Come and give me a hand here.


664
00:52:28.910 --> 00:52:30.662
Your wife's not here!

665
00:52:32.247 --> 00:52:35.083
- Your wife?
- Not here?


666
00:52:35.166 --> 00:52:36.835
Not here? Where is she?

667
00:52:38.169 --> 00:52:40.296
Well, s-she's...

668
00:52:40.380 --> 00:52:41.840
- She's what?
- I don't know.


669
00:52:41.923 --> 00:52:43.299
M
-M
-Maybe she's...

670
00:52:43.383 --> 00:52:46.720
And where's that friend of yours?
That loudmouthed squire?


671
00:52:49.597 --> 00:52:51.099
What?

672
00:52:51.182 --> 00:52:52.642
- No. No.
- "No" what?


673
00:52:52.726 --> 00:52:55.520
They're not upstairs.
I mean, they're not... they're not... here.


674
00:52:55.603 --> 00:52:58.064
N
-N
-No, no, they're not here. Not here.

675
00:52:58.148 --> 00:52:59.482
What?

676
00:53:00.775 --> 00:53:02.944
You swine!

677
00:53:05.196 --> 00:53:08.158
I'm gonna kill him.
Then I'm gonna kill you.


678
00:53:08.241 --> 00:53:09.868
Right.

679
00:53:36.311 --> 00:53:38.146
- Oh-ho!
- You...


680
00:53:38.229 --> 00:53:41.107
I'm going to get you!

681
00:53:41.191 --> 00:53:43.193
Oh, you sweet-talker, you!

682
00:53:45.987 --> 00:53:47.906
Oh, you toad!

683
00:53:51.951 --> 00:53:54.913
Right! What's all this?

684
00:53:54.996 --> 00:53:59.250
Brawling in the public streets.
Disturbing the king's peace, eh?


685
00:53:59.334 --> 00:54:01.795
This man... My wife... Let go of me.

686
00:54:01.878 --> 00:54:05.090
All right, hold him, Fred.
Now, young fella...


687
00:54:05.173 --> 00:54:08.093
Here, I know you!

688
00:54:08.176 --> 00:54:11.346
Fred, it was him
who tried to get in the other day.


689
00:54:11.429 --> 00:54:13.473
- My wife and that squire!
- Let's take 'em to the dungeon.


690
00:54:13.556 --> 00:54:15.058
A few days there will sort 'em out.

691
00:54:15.141 --> 00:54:19.395
Righto.
Then we can put irons on their legs, eh?


692
00:54:19.479 --> 00:54:20.688
But...

693
00:54:20.772 --> 00:54:21.815
You can't!

694
00:54:21.898 --> 00:54:26.569
Destroy the monster? Oh, sire.

695
00:54:26.653 --> 00:54:29.114
If you destroy the monster,
you destroy the city.


696
00:54:29.197 --> 00:54:32.992
In the long term, it will be shown
that we owe to the monster


697
00:54:33.076 --> 00:54:36.746
a period of prosperity
unprecedented in this kingdom.


698
00:54:36.830 --> 00:54:40.333
Oh, this is ridiculous. Your Majesty,
the tournament must continue.


699
00:54:40.416 --> 00:54:42.418
A champion must be chosen.

700
00:54:42.502 --> 00:54:44.212
- Bruno.
- Eh?


701
00:54:44.295 --> 00:54:47.799
The merchants may be prospering, but
your kingdom's on the verge of collapse.


702
00:54:47.882 --> 00:54:50.635
Oh. Yes. Oh, well, ah... Now, that...

703
00:54:50.718 --> 00:54:52.345
Now hear this!

704
00:54:53.888 --> 00:54:55.390
The king,

705
00:54:55.473 --> 00:54:58.226
that flower of chivalry,
that prince of monarchs,


706
00:54:58.309 --> 00:55:01.980
that paragon of potentates,
is going to speak.


707
00:55:02.730 --> 00:55:05.233
Hear the wisdom, witness the wit,

708
00:55:05.316 --> 00:55:07.944
observe the oratorical eloquence,

709
00:55:08.027 --> 00:55:10.196
lend an ear...

710
00:55:11.364 --> 00:55:12.532
Beautifully said.

711
00:55:12.615 --> 00:55:16.244
To the mellow voice, the tender tones,

712
00:55:16.327 --> 00:55:19.664
the voluptuous vowels,
the coruscating consonants


713
00:55:19.747 --> 00:55:23.501
of His Majesty King Bruno.

714
00:55:24.627 --> 00:55:26.504
Very lovely. Well, I...

715
00:55:26.588 --> 00:55:30.049
Who is going to give it to you straight,
illuminate the essence,


716
00:55:30.133 --> 00:55:33.720
clarify the conundrums,
dazzle us with logic.


717
00:55:34.596 --> 00:55:38.266
My lords, Your Grace, Your Honor...

718
00:55:39.267 --> 00:55:40.268
the king.

719
00:55:40.351 --> 00:55:43.605
Eh? Oh! Oh, yes, yes.

720
00:55:43.688 --> 00:55:49.068
Bishop, my dear fellow, how can you, a man
of God, say that the beast is good? Hmm?


721
00:55:49.152 --> 00:55:52.197
I, uh, welcome your question. Yes.

722
00:55:52.280 --> 00:55:55.533
Uh, indeed, it may seem paradoxical, but...

723
00:55:55.617 --> 00:55:58.703
since the advent of the beast,

724
00:55:58.786 --> 00:56:02.624
church attendance has tripled,
tithing has increased,


725
00:56:02.707 --> 00:56:06.794
long lines of sinners wait eagerly
outside the confessionals.


726
00:56:06.878 --> 00:56:08.755
Piety has never been higher.

727
00:56:08.838 --> 00:56:11.341
- Oh, bravo, bravo.
- Bravo. Bravo.


728
00:56:11.424 --> 00:56:13.009
Well, my lord Bishop...

729
00:56:13.092 --> 00:56:15.470
Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

730
00:56:15.553 --> 00:56:18.264
The king will speak.

731
00:56:18.348 --> 00:56:19.849
The king.

732
00:56:20.350 --> 00:56:23.561
Thank you.

733
00:56:23.645 --> 00:56:25.897
- Guard!
- Sire.


734
00:56:25.980 --> 00:56:27.649
- Kill that man.
- Sire.


735
00:56:27.732 --> 00:56:29.234
What?

736
00:56:29.317 --> 00:56:31.319
Who? Oh.

737
00:56:31.402 --> 00:56:34.072
Anyway, the most potent...

738
00:56:35.573 --> 00:56:39.619
Most poetical, most prestigious‒

739
00:56:44.374 --> 00:56:47.919
Well, Your Majesty, what is your opinion?

740
00:56:48.002 --> 00:56:49.602
- Your Highness.
- Give us your guidance.


741
00:56:49.671 --> 00:56:53.132
- Even a hint.
- Well, I think...


742
00:56:56.177 --> 00:57:00.181
Oh, no. What's that? 
What's going on here?

743
00:57:00.265 --> 00:57:02.141
Just one moment.

744
00:57:10.191 --> 00:57:12.026
What is going on here?

745
00:57:12.110 --> 00:57:15.863
Who dares sully my castle
with unseemly brawls?


746
00:57:15.947 --> 00:57:18.032
Guard, bring them in.

747
00:57:19.075 --> 00:57:21.327
We'll show them who's king around here.

748
00:57:21.411 --> 00:57:23.288
But, Your Majesty,
we have important matters to...


749
00:57:23.371 --> 00:57:26.499
Important matters, Passelewe?

750
00:57:26.582 --> 00:57:30.670
Surely keeping the peace
in my own castle is important.


751
00:57:30.753 --> 00:57:32.588
First things first.

752
00:57:33.298 --> 00:57:34.841
Oh!

753
00:57:34.924 --> 00:57:36.050
Ew.

754
00:57:39.262 --> 00:57:42.265
They'll taste the king's justice.

755
00:57:43.474 --> 00:57:44.892
Let me go!

756
00:57:52.525 --> 00:57:54.110
Silence!

757
00:57:56.863 --> 00:57:58.573
Silence!

758
00:57:59.490 --> 00:58:01.200
Now, what's this all about?

759
00:58:01.284 --> 00:58:03.578
The squire... behind my back!

760
00:58:03.661 --> 00:58:08.583
Calm, my man. Remember,
you're in the presence of your king.


761
00:58:08.666 --> 00:58:10.710
Guards, let him go.

762
00:58:12.003 --> 00:58:13.504
Let him speak.

763
00:58:13.588 --> 00:58:15.798
Your Majesty.

764
00:58:15.882 --> 00:58:20.136
This man... This ma... This man!

765
00:58:20.219 --> 00:58:23.306
Look out, sire! Get down!

766
00:58:37.028 --> 00:58:39.447
Wait. Hold it.

767
00:58:53.669 --> 00:58:56.422
This is outrageous!

768
00:58:58.383 --> 00:59:02.011
- Weren't there two of them to begin with?
- Yes, sir.


769
00:59:02.595 --> 00:59:06.307
- Well, where's the other one got to?
- I don't know, sir.


770
00:59:06.391 --> 00:59:09.644
Right. Hmm. Yes.

771
00:59:12.688 --> 00:59:17.235
Right. Then it falls upon us
to find this man guilty.


772
00:59:18.569 --> 00:59:21.697
Guilty? Guilty of what, sire?

773
00:59:22.573 --> 00:59:23.908
Cannibalism.

774
00:59:34.127 --> 00:59:36.087
- Keep your eyes peeled.
- Right.


775
00:59:38.631 --> 00:59:40.633
Quick, down this way!

776
01:00:23.468 --> 01:00:26.095
- Check up there.
- No. Come on.


777
01:00:39.650 --> 01:00:41.319
Watch the princess! Oh!

778
01:00:43.446 --> 01:00:46.157
At last you've come!

779
01:00:50.161 --> 01:00:52.788
- I'm terribly sorry for barging in.
- Oh, don't be shy.


780
01:00:52.872 --> 01:00:54.999
- I knew you'd come some day.
- Oh, Princess, for Christ's sake.


781
01:00:55.082 --> 01:00:56.834
I was coming up the stairs
and saw your door...


782
01:00:56.918 --> 01:00:59.045
Put on this robe. 
And you, turn around.

783
01:00:59.128 --> 01:01:00.505
I don't want to b-bother any...

784
01:01:00.588 --> 01:01:03.716
Oh, you must have
traveled far to reach me.


785
01:01:03.799 --> 01:01:08.012
Swum rivers, climbed mountains,
fought battles.


786
01:01:08.095 --> 01:01:10.097
You can turn around now.

787
01:01:12.350 --> 01:01:15.895
There. Do I come up to your expectations?

788
01:01:15.978 --> 01:01:18.898
Do you find me beautiful?

789
01:01:19.649 --> 01:01:20.900
Oh, yes. Thank you.

790
01:01:20.983 --> 01:01:24.529
Oh, come, my prince. Don't be shy.

791
01:01:24.612 --> 01:01:27.573
But I can't. Look at me.
I'm not dressed for the occasion.


792
01:01:27.657 --> 01:01:29.325
Oh. Tsk, tsk, tsk. Hush.

793
01:01:30.368 --> 01:01:34.288
You mustn't worry
about those filthy peasant rags,


794
01:01:34.372 --> 01:01:37.833
which you were no doubt forced to don
in some romantic adventure.


795
01:01:37.917 --> 01:01:42.004
Soon we'll have you attired
once more in princely finery.


796
01:01:42.088 --> 01:01:44.006
No, no, no.
You see, there's been some mistake.


797
01:01:44.090 --> 01:01:47.927
- See, uh, my name is Dennis.
- Prince Dennis!


798
01:01:48.010 --> 01:01:51.597
- No, no. Dennis Cooper. I used to be...
- But, oh, your face.


799
01:01:51.681 --> 01:01:55.434
- You're wounded.
- Oh, no, it's nothing. Just a bruise.


800
01:01:55.518 --> 01:01:59.438
Just a bruise?
Oh, how brave you are, my prince.


801
01:01:59.522 --> 01:02:03.234
For surely it must have been
a terrible blow from a Saracen's blade.


802
01:02:03.317 --> 01:02:05.403
No, an innkeeper sat on me.

803
01:02:05.486 --> 01:02:09.240
You see, uh, he thought that...
well, that this squire, you see...


804
01:02:09.323 --> 01:02:10.866
uh, his wife...

805
01:02:10.950 --> 01:02:14.453
- What, the innkeeper's wife was a squire?
- Oh, no, no, no.


806
01:02:14.537 --> 01:02:18.291
Oh, I've been dreaming of this day
for so long.


807
01:02:18.374 --> 01:02:23.379
But little did I expect one
so brave and valiant and wise,


808
01:02:23.462 --> 01:02:26.507
one who's crossed the seven seas for me

809
01:02:26.591 --> 01:02:32.096
and galloped across deserts and dark
canyons to be by my side at last.


810
01:02:32.179 --> 01:02:34.015
- My love!
- Come.


811
01:02:34.098 --> 01:02:37.184
You must tell me of your many adventures.

812
01:02:37.268 --> 01:02:40.313
We must get to know each other
before we're married.


813
01:02:40.938 --> 01:02:43.941
Married? Uh, no, 
I'm sorry, miss.

814
01:02:44.025 --> 01:02:48.362
- I-I can't. I can't do that.
- Can't? Can't?


815
01:02:48.446 --> 01:02:50.573
Oh, my prince, did I hear you right?

816
01:02:51.365 --> 01:02:53.868
- It's very kind of you to ask, but...
- No.


817
01:02:53.951 --> 01:02:56.203
No, don't tell me. I know.

818
01:02:56.287 --> 01:02:58.372
- I know.
- You know?


819
01:02:58.456 --> 01:03:02.877
In your adventures, you rescued
a maiden chained to a dark cliff.


820
01:03:03.961 --> 01:03:06.339
- Uh, no, not exactly.
- She fell in love.


821
01:03:06.422 --> 01:03:08.299
- You fell in love.
- No.


822
01:03:08.382 --> 01:03:11.385
And there and then,
before the gods themselves,


823
01:03:11.469 --> 01:03:14.221
you made a pact
that only death could break.


824
01:03:14.305 --> 01:03:16.974
- No, no, you're on the wrong tack.
- But come, my prince.


825
01:03:17.058 --> 01:03:20.102
You must not linger in idle conversation.

826
01:03:20.978 --> 01:03:23.731
You gained entry to the castle by stealth,

827
01:03:23.814 --> 01:03:27.318
and now you must
leave in the same way.

828
01:03:27.401 --> 01:03:29.028
I know!

829
01:03:29.111 --> 01:03:32.531
Sister Jessica,
you must give your habit to the prince.


830
01:03:32.615 --> 01:03:35.618
- My habit, Princess?
- Yes, and hurry.


831
01:03:35.701 --> 01:03:38.913
But... But what's wrong
with Sister Marian's habit?


832
01:03:38.996 --> 01:03:41.832
- Don't be silly. Here.
- But...


833
01:03:45.795 --> 01:03:48.798
Now, my prince, this is the plan.

834
01:03:50.132 --> 01:03:52.176
Tomorrow is St. 
Talulah's Day,

835
01:03:52.259 --> 01:03:55.596
and by first light,
a nun of the order must depart the city


836
01:03:55.680 --> 01:03:58.516
and lay fresh dogwood on the spot

837
01:03:58.599 --> 01:04:02.186
where St. Talulah was martyred
by the Ralph Benslow Four.


838
01:04:04.397 --> 01:04:06.524
You shall be that nun.

839
01:04:06.607 --> 01:04:09.026
Sister Jessica?

840
01:04:09.110 --> 01:04:10.611
Sister Jessica.

841
01:04:13.656 --> 01:04:16.117
Well, give it to the prince.

842
01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:18.285
Thank you, Sister Jes...

843
01:04:20.329 --> 01:04:22.123
sica.

844
01:04:22.206 --> 01:04:24.792
Then proceed to the western wall,

845
01:04:24.875 --> 01:04:27.461
but by the back streets only.

846
01:04:27.545 --> 01:04:30.005
When you get to the western gate, say,

847
01:04:30.089 --> 01:04:33.217
"I have the holy dogwood
for St. Talulah's spot.


848
01:04:33.300 --> 01:04:35.219
Let me pass that
I might pray a while."

849
01:04:42.810 --> 01:04:45.062
Oh, my prince. My prince.

850
01:04:46.105 --> 01:04:48.607
- Is this yours?
- Uh, yes. No!


851
01:04:48.691 --> 01:04:51.694
Oh, please! Please let me have it.

852
01:04:51.777 --> 01:04:56.073
Let me have it as a souvenir
of our hopeless, flawless love.


853
01:04:56.157 --> 01:04:58.868
- I'll cherish it always.
- No, I can't. It was given...


854
01:04:58.951 --> 01:05:01.829
And now, my prince, you must flee.

855
01:05:01.912 --> 01:05:05.916
No! No, don't kiss me.
I couldn't stand it.


856
01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.753
- I wasn't going to.
- No. Just go.


857
01:05:08.836 --> 01:05:11.547
Just go, my prince.

858
01:05:11.630 --> 01:05:13.632
And remember,

859
01:05:13.716 --> 01:05:17.303
"I have the holy dogwood
for St. Talulah's spot."


860
01:05:18.345 --> 01:05:20.723
In Latin, my love!

861
01:06:03.140 --> 01:06:05.017
- Evening, Sister.
- Evening.


862
01:06:05.100 --> 01:06:08.103

870
01:06:29.333 --> 01:06:32.711
Ah! What have we got here?

871
01:06:32.795 --> 01:06:35.506
A strange face?

872
01:06:35.589 --> 01:06:37.842
And a pretty one.

873
01:06:37.925 --> 01:06:40.386
Well, now, let's have a look.

874
01:06:40.469 --> 01:06:43.097
- Let's have a kiss.
- Come on, Sarge. She's a nun.


875
01:06:43.180 --> 01:06:44.974
So she is.

876
01:06:45.057 --> 01:06:49.270
Let's have a Christian kiss.

877
01:06:55.192 --> 01:06:56.819
What's the matter, Sarge?

878
01:06:56.902 --> 01:07:00.239
Put me to bed, boys! 
Put me to bed.

879
01:07:11.917 --> 01:07:14.336
Look, it's the devil in
the guise of a nun!

880
01:07:14.420 --> 01:07:16.672
No, it's a nun in
the guise of a devil!

881
01:07:16.755 --> 01:07:17.882
- Get her!
- Get him!


882
01:07:17.965 --> 01:07:19.174
Get them both!

883
01:07:20.217 --> 01:07:25.097
Citizens, a sacrifice must be made
to appease the monster


884
01:07:25.180 --> 01:07:28.601
that lurks in the darkness
in wait for us all!


885
01:07:28.684 --> 01:07:31.896
And what better than to sacrifice

886
01:07:31.979 --> 01:07:33.856
one of the beast's own servants,

887
01:07:33.939 --> 01:07:38.944
whom we caught masquerading
as a holy sister of the Mother Church?


888
01:07:44.199 --> 01:07:47.494
We will fire him into the eternal darkness

889
01:07:47.578 --> 01:07:51.957
as a testimony to our piety and godliness!

890
01:07:53.959 --> 01:07:57.796
Imagine his agony
as the flames rise higher,


891
01:07:57.880 --> 01:08:01.508
higher until he is but
a ball of living fire!


892
01:08:01.592 --> 01:08:03.052
Oh, the agony!

893
01:08:03.135 --> 01:08:05.804
Imagine his horror

894
01:08:05.888 --> 01:08:09.725
as the mighty ballistic device
hurls him high


895
01:08:09.808 --> 01:08:12.311
into the depths of the blackened sky!

896
01:08:12.394 --> 01:08:15.606
I am imagining the horror of it all!

897
01:08:15.689 --> 01:08:19.068
Imagine the terror of his suspense

898
01:08:19.151 --> 01:08:21.987
as our poor sacrifice waits, waits,

899
01:08:22.071 --> 01:08:28.327
waits for the darkling earth to rise up
and crush him to its harsh bosom!


900
01:08:30.537 --> 01:08:32.373
The incertitude.

901
01:08:32.456 --> 01:08:34.333
Oh, the uncertainty!

902
01:08:34.416 --> 01:08:35.793
I like suspense.

903
01:08:35.876 --> 01:08:38.504
Imagine his final horror

904
01:08:38.587 --> 01:08:41.715
as his miserable little life is snuffed out

905
01:08:41.799 --> 01:08:45.844
in a glorious bone-crushing cascade
of phosphorescence


906
01:08:45.928 --> 01:08:50.891
as he finally, agonizingly
smashes into the ground!


907
01:08:55.396 --> 01:08:58.440
- That's not fair, that.
- No, that's not fair at all.


908
01:08:58.524 --> 01:09:01.986
- It isn't fair.
- What's not fair?


909
01:09:02.069 --> 01:09:03.737
How come he gets to go?

910
01:09:03.821 --> 01:09:05.906
Why should he have
all the pain and all the agony?


911
01:09:05.990 --> 01:09:09.284
All that bone-crushing horror.
I want to go!


912
01:09:09.368 --> 01:09:11.704
- No, I want to go.
- No, I want to burn.


913
01:09:11.787 --> 01:09:15.332
I want to feel my bones bursting
into a billion pieces!


914
01:09:15.416 --> 01:09:20.671
I want to trace across the firmament,
a glowing ball of flame,


915
01:09:20.754 --> 01:09:24.508
a testament to my godliness and piety!

916
01:09:24.591 --> 01:09:26.093
What does that mean?

917
01:09:26.176 --> 01:09:28.637
I don't know, but I want it!

918
01:09:28.721 --> 01:09:30.347
I want it!

919
01:09:42.359 --> 01:09:44.403
Fire!

920
01:09:53.245 --> 01:09:54.913
Nice.

921
01:10:01.003 --> 01:10:04.465
Another glorious day
for a tournament, eh, Passelewe?


922
01:10:04.548 --> 01:10:06.425
I suppose so, Your Majesty.

923
01:10:07.384 --> 01:10:10.804
You suppose so? 
You suppose so?

924
01:10:10.888 --> 01:10:12.931
Buck up, man. Buck up.

925
01:10:13.015 --> 01:10:14.641
It's tournament time!

926
01:10:15.559 --> 01:10:17.019
Certainly, Your Majesty.

927
01:10:17.644 --> 01:10:22.649
But I can't but think there must be
a better way to choose a champion.


928
01:10:22.733 --> 01:10:24.902
A better way, Passelewe?

929
01:10:24.985 --> 01:10:27.446
What better than the shattering of lances,

930
01:10:27.529 --> 01:10:31.033
the flailing of the mace,
the cut and thrust of broadswords,


931
01:10:31.116 --> 01:10:33.577
the ring of falchion on cuissart?

932
01:10:33.660 --> 01:10:36.455
What better way than an honest tournament?

933
01:10:36.538 --> 01:10:39.958
Hmm, Passelewe? Yes.

934
01:10:40.042 --> 01:10:42.586
Ah, my dear.

935
01:10:42.669 --> 01:10:46.215
How beautiful you look.

936
01:10:46.298 --> 01:10:48.759
Ah! Yes.

937
01:10:48.842 --> 01:10:51.386
Th...

938
01:10:51.470 --> 01:10:54.014
What on earth is that?

939
01:10:54.098 --> 01:10:55.557
- But, Daddy...
- Ugh!


940
01:10:58.018 --> 01:10:59.561
Daddy!

941
01:11:16.286 --> 01:11:18.539
Look at that.

942
01:11:18.622 --> 01:11:22.334
Did you see that? Right in the middle
of the old demi-brassard.


943
01:11:22.417 --> 01:11:24.503
Jolly good. Bravo!

944
01:11:25.671 --> 01:11:28.632
Another one on the maimed list,
probably dead by now.


945
01:11:28.715 --> 01:11:32.344
Ah, merely a scratch, that's all.
Plenty more knights where he came from.


946
01:11:32.427 --> 01:11:34.847
Not really, sire.

947
01:11:34.930 --> 01:11:38.976
What do you mean, Passelewe,
"Not really, sire"?


948
01:11:39.059 --> 01:11:43.105
Now, which part of this
is giving you difficulty, Your Majesty?


949
01:11:43.188 --> 01:11:46.984
Well, all of it, frankly.
What do you mean by it?


950
01:11:47.067 --> 01:11:49.486
Well, basically,
I mean by saying, "Not really, sire,"


951
01:11:49.570 --> 01:11:53.615
I mean that the true situation is,
or is likely to be...


952
01:11:53.699 --> 01:11:55.701
- Yes?
- Ipso facto to the contrary


953
01:11:55.784 --> 01:11:59.496
and the exact opposite
to that which you may perceive.


954
01:11:59.580 --> 01:12:01.832
I appended "sire,"
because, after all, you are the king.


955
01:12:01.915 --> 01:12:03.834
- I mean, you are the king, aren't you?
- Yes.


956
01:12:03.917 --> 01:12:06.587
And that seems to be a reasonable way
of addressing a monarch.


957
01:12:06.670 --> 01:12:08.672
- Yes.
- Daddy.


958
01:12:08.755 --> 01:12:10.591
What is it, darling?

959
01:12:10.674 --> 01:12:12.843
Oh, I'm sorry, Passelewe.
What is it, darling?


960
01:12:12.926 --> 01:12:16.388
Look at that brute of a knight.
I couldn't marry anything like that.


961
01:12:16.471 --> 01:12:19.308
Of course not. 
You won't have to.

962
01:12:19.391 --> 01:12:22.311
He won't...

963
01:12:26.023 --> 01:12:27.816
Win.

964
01:12:29.651 --> 01:12:32.946
Passelewe,
what were we discussing a moment ago?


965
01:12:33.030 --> 01:12:35.782
The toll of your knights, sir.
According to my record...


966
01:12:35.866 --> 01:12:38.410
Ah, just a moment, Passelewe.

967
01:12:38.493 --> 01:12:41.663
You used that "sire" for the same reason

968
01:12:41.747 --> 01:12:44.291
that you used it
in the first place, right?

969
01:12:44.374 --> 01:12:46.376
- Right.
- Right.


970
01:12:46.460 --> 01:12:48.212
- I thought so.
- Right.


971
01:12:48.295 --> 01:12:53.675
Well, according to my records, approximately

972
01:12:53.759 --> 01:12:56.220
have been killed or maimed
since this tournament began.


973
01:12:56.929 --> 01:12:59.681
But, Passelewe, that's no figure at all.

974
01:12:59.765 --> 01:13:01.475
No figure at all.

975
01:13:01.558 --> 01:13:05.812
Now, if it was 83.3 percent
or 97.4 percent,


976
01:13:05.896 --> 01:13:08.273
now, that is a true percentage

977
01:13:08.357 --> 01:13:10.817
in absolutely the truest sense of the word.

978
01:13:10.901 --> 01:13:12.527
Now, my dearest Bruno, do listen.

979
01:13:12.611 --> 01:13:16.240
If this carnage continues even until
the end of the week, where on earth...


980
01:13:16.323 --> 01:13:17.950
- Hold it, hold it!
- What?


981
01:13:18.033 --> 01:13:20.244
This one I must see.

982
01:13:25.499 --> 01:13:28.043
There must be a better way
of choosing a champion.


983
01:13:31.046 --> 01:13:32.547
Psst. Ethel?

984
01:13:33.548 --> 01:13:35.342
Is that you, Ethel?

985
01:13:35.425 --> 01:13:37.928
Yeah. I wondered what the hell
happened to you last night.


986
01:13:38.011 --> 01:13:40.222
- Well, I had some incredible adventures.
- Can't talk now.


987
01:13:40.305 --> 01:13:43.517
- Due in the lists in 10 minutes' time.
- I'm coming, Mother.


988
01:13:45.560 --> 01:13:47.229
Aye!

989
01:13:47.312 --> 01:13:50.857
Watch where you're getting the blood,
will you? Christ Almighty!


990
01:13:50.941 --> 01:13:53.568
How else can we choose a champion?

991
01:13:53.652 --> 01:13:55.821
Well, I suppose we could call an election.

992
01:13:55.904 --> 01:13:58.073
- Election, Passelewe?
- Yes.


993
01:13:58.156 --> 01:14:01.868
Oh, no, nonsense.
It wouldn't be fair to the knights.


994
01:14:01.952 --> 01:14:04.162
Well, they could draw lots.

995
01:14:04.246 --> 01:14:06.290
- Draw lots?
- Yes.


996
01:14:06.373 --> 01:14:10.127
Bless my soul.

997
01:14:10.210 --> 01:14:13.922
I mean to say, you might just as well
do it dip-dip-dip, my little ship


998
01:14:14.006 --> 01:14:16.425
or one potato, two potatoes.

999
01:14:16.508 --> 01:14:20.345
Or even hide and seek.

1000
01:14:20.429 --> 01:14:22.472
Uh...

1001
01:14:22.556 --> 01:14:26.727
Forty-eight, 49, 50.

1002
01:14:27.936 --> 01:14:29.688
Coming!

1003
01:14:36.111 --> 01:14:39.197
- The cardinal said, "I asked for 13 vergers."
- Vergers?


1004
01:14:39.281 --> 01:14:43.327
"Why have you brought me 13 virgins?"

1005
01:14:43.410 --> 01:14:48.123
Now, we're in the garden,
and a thousand voices said as one man,


1006
01:14:48.206 --> 01:14:52.711
"Ave, ave, passed through this way,
the old grub."


1007
01:14:54.296 --> 01:14:57.549
"Ave, ave" what?

1008
01:14:57.632 --> 01:14:59.217
Why do I need to say "Ave"?

1009
01:14:59.301 --> 01:15:03.472
Dennis, why don't you sit back and let
something nice happen to you for a change?


1010
01:15:03.555 --> 01:15:06.892
Looks like they've chosen a champion.

1011
01:15:06.975 --> 01:15:09.227
Can you see who it is?

1012
01:15:13.732 --> 01:15:16.818
It's my boss. Christ.

1013
01:15:16.902 --> 01:15:20.697
Well, congratulations, sire.
We have a champion.


1014
01:15:20.781 --> 01:15:22.574
Good.

1015
01:15:22.657 --> 01:15:24.951
- Where is he?
- Oh, they haven't found him yet.


1016
01:15:25.035 --> 01:15:27.496
- Oh. Is that good?
- Oh, yes.


1017
01:15:27.579 --> 01:15:30.290
That's what makes him a champion.

1018
01:15:30.374 --> 01:15:32.000
I see.

1019
01:15:37.464 --> 01:15:40.342
They will find him, won't they?

1020
01:15:44.679 --> 01:15:47.724
- You must be very proud.
- Proud? You shit!


1021
01:15:48.725 --> 01:15:50.560
- Shit!
- It's a great honor, isn't it?


1022
01:15:50.644 --> 01:15:53.522
Honor? Maybe he'll get the honor.

1023
01:15:53.605 --> 01:15:57.484
I'll probably end up with a dragon's tooth
up my bum and a shilling a year pension.


1024
01:15:58.693 --> 01:16:01.947
I'll have to sit vigil with him
all night as well.


1025
01:16:02.030 --> 01:16:03.990
Christ, what luck!

1026
01:16:06.785 --> 01:16:09.579
I promised my body to a woman tonight.

1027
01:16:10.664 --> 01:16:12.833
Look, maybe I could go
and tell the lady that...


1028
01:16:12.916 --> 01:16:14.459
What?

1029
01:16:17.754 --> 01:16:20.465
Wait a minute. 
Maybe you could do it.

1030
01:16:20.549 --> 01:16:22.759
Certainly I could.
I'll tell the lady you've had a great...


1031
01:16:22.843 --> 01:16:26.721
No, not that. Sit the vigil.

1032
01:16:26.805 --> 01:16:28.348
Me?

1033
01:16:28.432 --> 01:16:32.185
I could give you my hat, my cape.

1034
01:16:33.061 --> 01:16:35.689
Just keep your head down.
He'll never know.


1035
01:16:35.772 --> 01:16:37.441
I can't do that. 
It's not right.

1036
01:16:37.524 --> 01:16:39.776
Who'll know? Come on!

1037
01:16:46.241 --> 01:16:50.579
Beast!

1038
01:16:50.662 --> 01:16:52.205
Here I am, I am!

1039
01:16:52.289 --> 01:16:56.501
Oh, not you!

1040
01:16:56.585 --> 01:16:58.670
Ah, forget it.

1041
01:17:57.354 --> 01:17:58.980
Squire? What squire?

1042
01:17:59.064 --> 01:18:04.236
You know what squire!
Oh! My rheumatism.


1043
01:18:04.319 --> 01:18:06.196
That cell was so damp.

1044
01:18:06.279 --> 01:18:09.324
- Two whole nights.
- Oh, you poor dear.


1045
01:18:09.407 --> 01:18:12.911
Come, let me undress you
and put you to bed.


1046
01:18:12.994 --> 01:18:15.705
It must have been an awful experience.

1047
01:18:16.915 --> 01:18:18.792
It was.

1048
01:18:18.875 --> 01:18:21.294
Oh, Betty.

1049
01:18:21.378 --> 01:18:24.339
Your hands are so soft and warm.

1050
01:18:24.422 --> 01:18:29.553
You don't really think there was a squire
up here in our bed, do you?


1051
01:18:29.636 --> 01:18:31.471
- Well...
- Do you?


1052
01:18:31.555 --> 01:18:34.391
Come, let me take those off.

1053
01:18:34.474 --> 01:18:36.142
And that.

1054
01:18:36.226 --> 01:18:39.437
Mmm. Doesn't that feel better?

1055
01:18:39.521 --> 01:18:42.274
Oh, Betty.

1056
01:18:42.357 --> 01:18:45.193
Bernard, my darling.

1057
01:18:58.623 --> 01:19:01.167
Come.

1058
01:19:31.448 --> 01:19:34.534
Citizens, nobles...

1059
01:19:36.244 --> 01:19:38.330
gentry,

1060
01:19:38.413 --> 01:19:40.582
the king.

1061
01:19:41.958 --> 01:19:43.835
Heh? Oh, yes.

1062
01:19:47.756 --> 01:19:52.177
Good Sir Knight, you have proved
your worth on the field of honor.


1063
01:19:58.058 --> 01:20:01.811
And now you must prove yourself
in mortal combat


1064
01:20:01.895 --> 01:20:03.813
with a monster so terrifying,

1065
01:20:03.897 --> 01:20:06.941
so awe-inspiring, so horrible,

1066
01:20:07.025 --> 01:20:08.902
so soul-destroying...

1067
01:20:10.236 --> 01:20:12.238
that even I would hesitate...

1068
01:20:13.323 --> 01:20:16.242
to meet it face-to-face...

1069
01:20:17.494 --> 01:20:20.538
in, um, um, hand-to-hand combat.

1070
01:20:21.539 --> 01:20:22.916
Was that all right?

1071
01:20:22.999 --> 01:20:25.377
Well, I suppose so, my darling, yes.

1072
01:20:26.461 --> 01:20:30.799
And so, go forth and slay the beast.

1073
01:20:30.882 --> 01:20:35.679
And take with you the royal blessings...

1074
01:20:37.138 --> 01:20:39.599
and also the blessings

1075
01:20:39.683 --> 01:20:42.060
of Mother Church.

1076
01:20:43.937 --> 01:20:44.979
Bishop!

1077
01:20:59.119 --> 01:21:01.121
Hey!

1078
01:21:04.290 --> 01:21:06.084
Ow! Ooh! Get out of here!

1079
01:21:06.167 --> 01:21:07.877
Bloody swords!

1080
01:21:42.829 --> 01:21:45.457
- Is that all?
- That's it.


1081
01:21:48.877 --> 01:21:50.712
Oh.

1082
01:21:50.795 --> 01:21:53.923
Right. Uh, herald.

1083
01:21:54.883 --> 01:21:56.885
Have the gates opened.

1084
01:22:00.096 --> 01:22:01.097
Well, carry on!

1085
01:22:03.433 --> 01:22:06.895
Open the gates!

1086
01:22:22.368 --> 01:22:23.870
Farewell.

1087
01:22:27.373 --> 01:22:28.625
Wait!

1088
01:22:32.962 --> 01:22:35.381
Ah.

1089
01:22:36.299 --> 01:22:39.511
He took his vorpal sword in hand,

1090
01:22:39.594 --> 01:22:43.264
long time the manxome foe he sought.

1091
01:22:43.348 --> 01:22:47.936
<i>So rested he by the Tumtum tree</i>

1092
01:22:48.019 --> 01:22:51.648
<i>and stood a while... in thought.</i>

1093
01:22:52.357 --> 01:22:55.401
And as in uffish thought he stood,

1094
01:22:55.485 --> 01:22:58.905
the Jabberwock with eyes aflame

1095
01:22:58.988 --> 01:23:02.951
<i>came whiffling through the tulgey wood</i>

1096
01:23:03.034 --> 01:23:05.620
<i>and burbled as it came.</i>

1097
01:23:07.288 --> 01:23:10.458
Lance.

1098
01:23:10.542 --> 01:23:12.544
Lance. Lance.

1099
01:23:19.384 --> 01:23:21.594
Whoa-ha!

1100
01:24:11.936 --> 01:24:12.937
Griselda!

1101
01:24:17.775 --> 01:24:19.444
Go get 'em, boys!

1102
01:24:25.950 --> 01:24:28.328
Monster? Monster?

1103
01:24:30.622 --> 01:24:33.875
- Oh.
- Where monster?


1104
01:24:33.958 --> 01:24:36.252
Oh! Oh! Oh!

1105
01:24:37.712 --> 01:24:39.422
- Oh!
- There he is!


1106
01:24:43.134 --> 01:24:47.180
Come on. Don't let him get away.

1107
01:24:47.263 --> 01:24:50.308
Monster? Monster?

1108
01:24:50.391 --> 01:24:52.393
No Mon...

1109
01:24:52.477 --> 01:24:54.354
Ha-ha!

1110
01:25:14.916 --> 01:25:18.086
I am here, Griselda. Fear not.

1111
01:25:18.169 --> 01:25:20.380
Gee, a knight.

1112
01:25:20.463 --> 01:25:22.799
I never saw a knight before.

1113
01:25:24.050 --> 01:25:27.470
Oh, Mr. Fishfinger.

1114
01:25:27.553 --> 01:25:30.181
Oh, stop dribbling, woman!

1115
01:25:30.264 --> 01:25:32.809
Oh, bless you. 
Oh, noble lad.

1116
01:25:32.892 --> 01:25:35.520
Oh, thank you. Oh!

1117
01:25:35.895 --> 01:25:38.773
Stand aside, Mrs. Fishfinger. And...

1118
01:25:38.856 --> 01:25:43.069
Oh, fuck! Aah!

1119
01:25:43.152 --> 01:25:45.321
Sorry, Mr. Fishfinger. 
Are you all right?

1120
01:25:45.405 --> 01:25:48.533
You almost cut my arm off!

1121
01:25:48.616 --> 01:25:53.955
Oh, you always were a clumsy one,
Dennis Cooper.


1122
01:25:54.038 --> 01:25:56.165
Shame on you!

1123
01:25:56.249 --> 01:25:58.209
Get out!

1124
01:25:58.292 --> 01:26:00.586
Jesus!

1125
01:26:00.670 --> 01:26:03.840
I could get blood poisoning.
Was that sword sterilized?


1126
01:26:03.923 --> 01:26:06.134
I'm terribly sorry. 
I didn't mean to.

1127
01:26:06.217 --> 01:26:08.970
Look, I-I'll bind it up for you.
I'll get some bandages.


1128
01:26:09.053 --> 01:26:11.055
Jesus. Get off!

1129
01:26:12.598 --> 01:26:14.100
Dad!

1130
01:26:15.351 --> 01:26:17.520
- What?
- Look!


1131
01:26:21.065 --> 01:26:23.109
Huh?

1132
01:26:23.901 --> 01:26:26.237
Good Sir Knight. 
Good Sir Knight.

1133
01:26:26.320 --> 01:26:31.909
We're so grateful to you for rescuing us
from the clutches of those foul fiends.


1134
01:26:31.993 --> 01:26:34.412
- Easy.
- Very good.


1135
01:26:34.495 --> 01:26:36.456
- Very gracious of you, Sir Knight.
- Yes.


1136
01:26:36.539 --> 01:26:40.626
We're very undeserving really,
being just humble fisher folk.


1137
01:26:40.710 --> 01:26:44.464
Yes, however, we do have
this maiden daughter, you see.


1138
01:26:44.547 --> 01:26:46.966
And as there is
a custom in these parts,

1139
01:26:47.050 --> 01:26:51.262
the knight quite often marries
the maiden he's rescued.


1140
01:26:51.345 --> 01:26:54.098
Say hello to the knight, 
Griselda, honey.

1141
01:26:54.182 --> 01:26:56.976
Mr. Fishfinger. Mr. Fishfinger.
It was me that rescued you.


1142
01:26:57.060 --> 01:27:00.980
Will you clear off?
What do you say, Sir Knight, hmm?


1143
01:27:01.064 --> 01:27:03.399
Good Sir Knight.

1144
01:27:11.324 --> 01:27:13.284
- Well?
- Come. We go.


1145
01:27:13.367 --> 01:27:18.164
Wait, wait! Come back here!
Sir Knight, come back, please!


1146
01:27:18.247 --> 01:27:20.041
- Whoo-hoo!
- You will think it over, won't you?


1147
01:27:20.124 --> 01:27:23.419
Griselda, Mr. Fishfinger. I've gotta go.
I'm sorry about your hand.


1148
01:27:23.503 --> 01:27:26.297
- It hurts! It...
- Griselda, I've missed you so much.


1149
01:27:26.380 --> 01:27:29.842
- I've kept your potato.
- Ugh! Bye!


1150
01:27:30.802 --> 01:27:34.097
You really are a big disappointment to me,
Dennis.


1151
01:27:34.180 --> 01:27:37.141
Get out. I thought you were going
to make something of yourself!


1152
01:27:37.225 --> 01:27:39.769
Mr. Fishfinger, he is the king's champion.

1153
01:27:39.852 --> 01:27:43.314
Shame! Call yourself an eligible suitor
for our fair Griselda?


1154
01:27:43.397 --> 01:27:45.024
You're nothing but a vagrant!

1155
01:27:45.108 --> 01:27:47.443
Hold him, Madge. Hold him!

1156
01:27:47.527 --> 01:27:51.531
- You leave her alone. Leave her alone!
- Get on with you.


1157
01:27:54.325 --> 01:27:56.619
Go on!

1158
01:27:56.702 --> 01:27:58.412
Go on!

1159
01:27:58.496 --> 01:28:00.706
Go on. Get out of here.

1160
01:28:04.544 --> 01:28:06.504
Go on! Get off!

1161
01:28:06.587 --> 01:28:08.965
- Go on with you.
- Go on!


1162
01:28:09.048 --> 01:28:10.550
- Yes!
- Go home!


1163
01:28:35.575 --> 01:28:37.743
Someone at the door, dear.

1164
01:28:37.827 --> 01:28:40.496
We've got to make up our minds now!

1165
01:28:40.580 --> 01:28:42.582
- Gentlemen!
- We can't delay another day.


1166
01:28:42.665 --> 01:28:44.167
We must do something.

1167
01:28:44.250 --> 01:28:46.794
This king's champion must be stopped.

1168
01:28:46.878 --> 01:28:50.173
The monster must be protected.

1169
01:28:50.256 --> 01:28:53.467
If he kills the monster,
we'll all be ruined. Ruined!


1170
01:28:53.551 --> 01:28:57.388
Let me prevail upon you.
No more argy-bargy is necessary.


1171
01:28:57.471 --> 01:29:00.558
- No?
- Because I have a plan.


1172
01:29:07.481 --> 01:29:09.358
Behold!

1173
01:29:09.442 --> 01:29:11.319
The Black Knight.

1174
01:29:12.570 --> 01:29:15.615
Oh, wonderful!

1175
01:30:06.499 --> 01:30:09.126
Ew!

1176
01:30:09.210 --> 01:30:11.045
Ugh. Ew!

1177
01:30:15.216 --> 01:30:17.134
I think we must be getting closer.

1178
01:31:29.206 --> 01:31:32.209
Cuissart. Cuissart.

1179
01:31:38.674 --> 01:31:40.676
No, no, no, no. Cuissart. Cuissart.

1180
01:31:41.719 --> 01:31:43.012
No, no.

1181
01:31:45.723 --> 01:31:49.101
No, no. Come on, come on.

1182
01:31:49.185 --> 01:31:50.686
Oh.

1183
01:31:55.316 --> 01:31:56.817
Lance.

1184
01:32:03.240 --> 01:32:04.867
Oh.

1185
01:32:37.983 --> 01:32:39.485
Oh.

1186
01:32:49.120 --> 01:32:50.121
Oh.

1187
01:32:59.713 --> 01:33:01.549
- No.
- Get him. Get him.


1188
01:34:02.359 --> 01:34:04.570
Whee!

1189
01:35:38.163 --> 01:35:39.665
Oh!

1190
01:35:42.626 --> 01:35:44.461
Huh?

1191
01:38:34.923 --> 01:38:38.385
And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?

1192
01:38:38.469 --> 01:38:41.930
Come to my arms, my beamish boy.

1193
01:38:42.014 --> 01:38:45.559
- O frabjous day!
- The monster's dead!


1194
01:38:45.642 --> 01:38:49.646
The monster's dead!

1195
01:39:22.513 --> 01:39:26.350
Stop! No one's to enter the city
unless they have some money!


1196
01:39:26.433 --> 01:39:29.144
Stop, I say! Stop.

1197
01:39:43.200 --> 01:39:44.785
Oh, my God!

1198
01:39:44.868 --> 01:39:46.411
Aaah! Ooh!

1199
01:39:47.371 --> 01:39:52.125
Cancel those shipments of wine,
grain, straw! Cancel everything!


1200
01:40:04.680 --> 01:40:06.473
Dennis!

1201
01:40:06.557 --> 01:40:10.102
- Dennis, here she is, Griselda.
- Dennis, here I am!


1202
01:40:10.185 --> 01:40:13.146
Here I am! Whoo! Dennis!

1203
01:40:13.230 --> 01:40:14.731
It's me!

1204
01:40:15.732 --> 01:40:17.442
Dennis!

1205
01:40:17.526 --> 01:40:19.820
Dennis, it was always you!

1206
01:40:19.903 --> 01:40:22.406
You was the one
we was always pushing for.

1207
01:40:22.489 --> 01:40:25.617
We'll have the wedding tomorrow,
even this afternoon.


1208
01:40:25.701 --> 01:40:27.661
We'll get the bishop.

1209
01:40:29.288 --> 01:40:31.456
Dennis, you're wonderful.

1210
01:40:31.540 --> 01:40:34.960
Griselda, at last we can have
the life we always wanted.


1211
01:40:51.476 --> 01:40:53.312
Ah.

1212
01:41:06.658 --> 01:41:09.745
My boy, congratulations.

1213
01:41:09.828 --> 01:41:12.456
We offer you our heartfelt thanks.

1214
01:41:12.539 --> 01:41:15.959
You have cleared the kingdom
of a great menace.


1215
01:41:16.043 --> 01:41:20.130
And I am very
happy to fulfill my promise

1216
01:41:20.213 --> 01:41:22.215
and to bestow upon you...

1217
01:41:22.299 --> 01:41:24.092
Uh, what's his name?

1218
01:41:24.176 --> 01:41:27.971
It's Dennis.
Uh, Dennis Cooper, Your Royalshipness.


1219
01:41:28.055 --> 01:41:29.890
And that's his fiancée, my daughter.

1220
01:41:29.973 --> 01:41:32.434
Eh, you, Dennis,

1221
01:41:32.517 --> 01:41:34.895
one-half of my entire kingdom.

1222
01:41:38.273 --> 01:41:42.319
And the hand in marriage
of my daughter, the princess.


1223
01:41:43.445 --> 01:41:46.073
Come, my boy, to the palace.

1224
01:41:46.156 --> 01:41:48.033
- But...
- Come.


1225
01:41:48.116 --> 01:41:51.286
- Oh! Oh!
- Griselda.


1226
01:41:53.246 --> 01:41:56.541
I pronounce you man and wife.

1227
01:41:56.625 --> 01:41:58.919
Prince and princess.

1228
01:42:16.436 --> 01:42:18.397
Dennis!

1229
01:42:19.356 --> 01:42:21.441
Griselda!

1230
01:42:24.069 --> 01:42:27.197
Whose idea was it
when you come up and you said...


1231
01:42:27.280 --> 01:42:28.615
Will you shut up?

1232
01:42:40.585 --> 01:42:42.879
Look out, sire!
