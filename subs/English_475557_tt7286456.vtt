<i>It's day 18
of the garbage strike,</i>


8
00:00:25.356 --> 00:00:27.983
<i>with 10,000 tons of garbage
piling up every day.</i>

<i>Even the nicest sections
of the city</i>


10

<i>Health Commissioner

<i>or comes down
with typhoid fever.</i>


16
00:00:41.163 --> 00:00:43.164
<i>It's already
a serious situation.</i>


17
00:00:43.332 --> 00:00:44.374

18
00:00:44.458 --> 00:00:45.542
<i>almost everyone in the city,</i>

19
00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:47.752

20

<i>It's starting to
affect my business</i>


23

<i>when customers
can't get in here</i>


24

<i>because of
the garbage situation.</i>


25
00:00:56.887 --> 00:00:58.555
<i>I'm not out that long
to smell it,</i>


26
00:00:58.639 --> 00:01:00.473
<i>but I think to look at it,
it's terrible.</i>


27
00:01:00.641 --> 00:01:02.100
<i>It don't affect me except</i>

28
00:01:02.184 --> 00:01:03.810

29
00:01:03.978 --> 00:01:04.978
<i>It's horrific.</i>

30
00:01:05.146 --> 00:01:06.354
It's a mess.

anything like it.</i>


33
00:01:09.442 --> 00:01:10.900
<i>What is this world coming to?</i>

34
00:01:11.068 --> 00:01:12.152
Put 'em in a room,

35
00:01:12.236 --> 00:01:13.653
<i>let 'em sit there and talk
until they get it over with.</i>

Yo, what's up
with your shoes, bro?


46
00:02:05.998 --> 00:02:06.998
Nice outfit, pal.

47
00:02:07.166 --> 00:02:08.375
If you're gonna be
a clown, at least you could be


48
00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.085
a good one.
You know that, right?


49
00:02:11.003 --> 00:02:12.253
- Hey! Hey!
- Grab it!


50
00:02:12.421 --> 00:02:13.421
Go, go, go!

51
00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:14.756
Hey!

52
00:02:15.132 --> 00:02:16.132
He's coming!

53
00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.802
Come on, clown, let's go!
We've got the sign.


54
00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:20.470
- Look at him running.
- Let's go!


55
00:02:20.554 --> 00:02:21.554
Stop them!

56
00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:23.515
Go, go, go, go!
Watch the car, watch the car!


57
00:02:25.976 --> 00:02:27.227
Where's your sign,
clown?


58
00:02:27.895 --> 00:02:29.312
Hey!

59
00:02:33.734 --> 00:02:35.151
Go, clown! Come on!

60
00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:36.403
Stop them!

61
00:02:38.322 --> 00:02:39.697
Go! Come on!

62
00:02:42.201 --> 00:02:43.368
Stop them!

63
00:02:43.536 --> 00:02:45.161
Come on, run!

64
00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:48.665
Hey!

65
00:02:49.917 --> 00:02:51.418
You fucking...

66
00:02:56.048 --> 00:02:58.007
Oh, shit! Good hit.

67
00:02:58.175 --> 00:02:59.926
Come on!
Beat his ass up.


68
00:03:00.094 --> 00:03:01.845
Come on! This guy's weak.
He can't do nothing.


69
00:03:02.012 --> 00:03:03.930
Harder! Harder!

70
00:03:04.098 --> 00:03:05.348
Beat him up. Take his stuff.

71
00:03:05.516 --> 00:03:07.767
Let's go, let's go!
Come on. Let's go!


72
00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:04.240
Ha!

73
00:04:51.956 --> 00:04:53.331
Is it just me,

74
00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.001
or is it getting crazier
out there?


75
00:05:00.589 --> 00:05:03.424
It is certainly tense.

76
00:05:03.968 --> 00:05:05.802
People are upset.

77
00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:08.846
They're struggling.
Looking for work.


78
00:05:09.014 --> 00:05:10.390
These are tough times.

79
00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:14.811
How about you?

80
00:05:16.438 --> 00:05:18.523
Have you been keeping up
with your journal?


81
00:05:20.317 --> 00:05:22.068
Yes, ma'am.

82
00:05:23.612 --> 00:05:24.988
Great.

83
00:05:25.906 --> 00:05:27.448
Did you bring it with you?

84
00:05:32.037 --> 00:05:33.121
Arthur.

85
00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:35.623
Last time, I asked you
to bring your journal


86
00:05:35.708 --> 00:05:37.375
with you
for these appointments.


87
00:05:38.085 --> 00:05:39.419
Can I see it?

88
00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:54.267
I've been
using it as a journal,


89
00:05:56.145 --> 00:05:57.812
but also as a joke diary.

90
00:05:58.939 --> 00:06:02.317
Funny thoughts
or observations.


91
00:06:03.444 --> 00:06:04.611
I think I told you

92
00:06:04.695 --> 00:06:07.864
I'm pursuing a career
in stand-up comedy.


93
00:06:11.285 --> 00:06:12.910
No, you didn't.

94
00:06:14.371 --> 00:06:16.372
I think I did.

95
00:06:24.923 --> 00:06:28.843
"I just hope my death makes
more sense than my life. "


96
00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:47.195
How does it feel to
have to come here?


97
00:06:47.613 --> 00:06:50.365
Does it help to
have someone to talk to?


98
00:06:54.411 --> 00:06:55.662
I think I felt better

99
00:06:55.746 --> 00:06:57.747
when I was locked up
in the hospital.


100
00:06:59.792 --> 00:07:01.042
And have you
thought more about


101
00:07:02.419 --> 00:07:03.795
why you were locked up?

102
00:07:09.635 --> 00:07:11.302
Who knows?

103
00:07:18.477 --> 00:07:20.228
I was wondering
if you could ask the doctor


104
00:07:20.312 --> 00:07:22.230
to increase my medication.

105
00:07:27.945 --> 00:07:30.571
Arthur, you're on
seven different medications.


106
00:07:31.907 --> 00:07:34.492
Surely,
they must be doing something.


107
00:07:37.037 --> 00:07:40.206
I just don't want to
feel so bad anymore.


108
00:08:16.285 --> 00:08:18.453
Would you please
stop bothering my kid?


109
00:08:21.623 --> 00:08:22.623
I wasn't bothering him.
I was...


110
00:08:22.708 --> 00:08:23.916
Just stop.

111
00:08:32.468 --> 00:08:34.260
What? You think that's funny?

112
00:08:42.561 --> 00:08:44.187
I'm sorry. I have a...

113
00:09:00.788 --> 00:09:01.788
I'm sorry.

114
00:10:40.721 --> 00:10:42.138
Happy,
did you check the mail


115
00:10:42.222 --> 00:10:43.556
before you came up?

116
00:10:43.724 --> 00:10:45.308
Yeah, Mom.

117
00:10:46.184 --> 00:10:47.768
Nothing.

118
00:10:50.939 --> 00:10:52.481
<i>And finally, tonight,</i>

119
00:10:52.566 --> 00:10:54.567
<i>just when you thought
it couldn't get any worse,</i>


120
00:10:54.902 --> 00:10:56.027

121
00:10:56.111 --> 00:10:58.571
<i>the city is under siege
by scores of rats.</i>


122
00:10:58.739 --> 00:11:00.031
<i>And not just any rats,</i>

123
00:11:00.115 --> 00:11:02.241
<i>but super rats,
who are hard to kill.</i>


124
00:11:02.409 --> 00:11:04.327
He must not be
getting my letters.


125
00:11:04.494 --> 00:11:05.494
Yeah.

126
00:11:05.704 --> 00:11:07.747
It's Thomas Wayne, Mom.

127
00:11:07.915 --> 00:11:09.332
He's a busy man.

128
00:11:09.499 --> 00:11:13.210
Please. I worked
for that family for years.


129
00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:15.671
The least he could do
is write back.


130
00:11:17.215 --> 00:11:20.384
Here.
Don't get all worked up. Eat.


131
00:11:20.552 --> 00:11:21.552
You need to eat.

132
00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:25.348
You need to eat.
Look how skinny you are.


133
00:11:26.892 --> 00:11:28.517
<i>Both victims
were taken to Gotham General.</i>


134
00:11:28.602 --> 00:11:29.727
Sounds like

135
00:11:29.811 --> 00:11:30.811
<i>the city needs to
find the Pied Piper.</i>


136
00:11:30.979 --> 00:11:33.648
He'll make a great mayor.
Everybody says so.


137
00:11:34.191 --> 00:11:37.610
Oh, yeah. Everybody who?
Who do you talk to?


138
00:11:38.195 --> 00:11:40.571
Well, everybody on the news.

139
00:11:40.739 --> 00:11:42.907
He's the only one
who could save the city.


140
00:11:43.075 --> 00:11:44.408
He owes it to us.

141
00:11:46.745 --> 00:11:48.829
Come sit. It's starting.

142
00:11:48.997 --> 00:11:50.790
Yay, Murray.

143

Thank you.

Thank you.

154

We got a great-looking
audience tonight.


155

Yeah!

Wow. Thank you. Thank you.

Thank you.

158
00:12:43.343 --> 00:12:45.803
So, everybody's heard
about the super rats that


159
00:12:45.887 --> 00:12:48.305
- are in Gotham now, right?
- Yeah.


160
00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:51.767
Well, today, the mayor said
he has a solution.


161

You ready for this?

162
00:12:53.645 --> 00:12:54.729
Super cats.

163
00:12:59.317 --> 00:13:00.735
But in all seriousness,
I mean, these rats are...


164
00:13:00.902 --> 00:13:02.403
I love you, Murray!

165
00:13:04.281 --> 00:13:05.573
I love you, too.

166
00:13:07.492 --> 00:13:09.076
Hey, Bobby,
would you put the lights on?


167
00:13:09.244 --> 00:13:10.244
Who is that?

168
00:13:10.412 --> 00:13:12.580
Was that you?
You wanna stand up, please?


169
00:13:12.748 --> 00:13:14.665
Stand up for me.

170
00:13:14.833 --> 00:13:15.833
Go ahead.

171
00:13:21.006 --> 00:13:22.715
What's your name?

172
00:13:23.258 --> 00:13:25.259
Hi, Murray. Arthur.

173
00:13:25.427 --> 00:13:27.094
- Arthur?
- My name's Arthur.


174
00:13:27.262 --> 00:13:28.929
Oh, okay. Well, there's
something special about you,


175
00:13:29.014 --> 00:13:30.056
Arthur, I could tell.

176
00:13:30.223 --> 00:13:31.223
Where are you from?

177
00:13:31.391 --> 00:13:33.100
I live right here in the city

178
00:13:33.268 --> 00:13:34.852
with my mother.

179
00:13:36.313 --> 00:13:37.438
Okay, hold on.
Hold on.


180
00:13:37.522 --> 00:13:38.522
There's nothing funny
about that.


181
00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:41.358
I lived with my mother before
I made it. Just me and her.


182
00:13:41.526 --> 00:13:44.361
I'm that kid whose father went
out for a pack of cigarettes,


183
00:13:44.529 --> 00:13:45.529
and he never came back.

184
00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:48.741
I know
what that's like, Murray.


185
00:13:48.909 --> 00:13:51.452
I've been the man of the house
for as long as I can remember.


186
00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:53.370
I take good care of my mother.

187
00:13:57.542 --> 00:14:00.461
All that sacrifice,
she must love you very much.


188
00:14:00.629 --> 00:14:01.629
She does.

189
00:14:02.464 --> 00:14:06.342
She always tells me to smile
and put on a happy face.


190
00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:09.136
She says I was put here
to spread joy and laughter.


191
00:14:13.058 --> 00:14:14.058
Wow.

192
00:14:16.812 --> 00:14:19.563
I like that. I like that
a lot. Come on down.


193
00:14:19.731 --> 00:14:22.566
Come on. For that,
you gotta come down.


194
00:14:22.734 --> 00:14:24.151
Come on! Come on.

195
00:14:32.119 --> 00:14:33.119
Come on.

196
00:14:48.343 --> 00:14:50.594
Okay, we got a big show
tonight. Stay tuned.


197
00:14:50.762 --> 00:14:52.555
We'll be right back.

198
00:14:53.306 --> 00:14:54.723
That was great, Arthur.
Thank you.


199
00:14:54.891 --> 00:14:56.642
I mean, I loved hearing
what you had to say.


200
00:14:56.810 --> 00:14:58.018
It made my day.

201
00:14:58.186 --> 00:14:59.395
Thanks, Murray.

202
00:14:59.813 --> 00:15:01.480
You see all this,
the lights, the show,


203
00:15:01.565 --> 00:15:02.857
the audience, all that stuff?

204
00:15:03.024 --> 00:15:04.191
I'd give it all up
in a heartbeat


205
00:15:04.276 --> 00:15:05.442
to have a kid like you.

206
00:15:48.028 --> 00:15:49.904
- What's up, ladies?
- Hey, Randall. What's up?


207
00:15:50.071 --> 00:15:51.739
Another day in chuckle town.

208
00:15:51.907 --> 00:15:52.907
Yup.

209
00:15:56.453 --> 00:15:57.536
You okay?

210
00:15:59.497 --> 00:16:01.999
I heard about
the beatdown you took.


211
00:16:02.751 --> 00:16:03.834
Fucking savages.

212
00:16:05.378 --> 00:16:07.796
It was just a bunch of kids.
I should have left it alone.


213
00:16:07.881 --> 00:16:08.923
No.

214
00:16:09.090 --> 00:16:11.425
They'll take everything
from you if you do that.


215
00:16:11.593 --> 00:16:12.927
All the crazy shit out there.

216
00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:15.179
They're animals.

217
00:16:19.684 --> 00:16:20.976
You know what?

218
00:16:26.233 --> 00:16:27.233
Here.

219
00:16:28.902 --> 00:16:30.152
What is it?

220
00:16:30.612 --> 00:16:31.695
Take it.

221
00:16:32.614 --> 00:16:33.697
It's for you.

222
00:16:38.161 --> 00:16:40.120
You gotta
protect yourself out there.


223
00:16:40.872 --> 00:16:42.373
Otherwise,
you're gonna get fucked.


224
00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.167
Randall,

225
00:16:46.628 --> 00:16:49.255
I'm not supposed to
have a gun.


226
00:16:50.799 --> 00:16:52.258
Don't sweat it, Art.

227
00:16:53.051 --> 00:16:54.301
No one has to know.

228
00:16:54.469 --> 00:16:56.804
And you can pay me back
some other time.


229
00:16:56.972 --> 00:16:58.180
You know you're my boy.

230
00:17:00.392 --> 00:17:01.392
Arthur,

231
00:17:02.018 --> 00:17:03.519
Hoyt wants to
see you in his office.


232
00:17:04.271 --> 00:17:06.772
Hey, Gary. You know
what I've always wondered?


233
00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:08.065
No idea.

234
00:17:08.233 --> 00:17:10.067
Do you people call it
miniature golf


235
00:17:10.151 --> 00:17:11.610
or is it just golf to you?

236
00:17:16.866 --> 00:17:18.367
Punch him in the dick,
Gary.


237
00:17:35.343 --> 00:17:36.969
Hello, Hoyt.

238
00:17:37.137 --> 00:17:39.638
Gary said
you wanted to see me.


239
00:17:39.806 --> 00:17:42.725
How's the comedy career?
Are you a famous stand-up yet?


240
00:17:42.809 --> 00:17:43.851
Not quite.

241
00:17:44.019 --> 00:17:46.145
Just been
working on my material.


242
00:17:46.313 --> 00:17:48.230
No, don't sit.
This'll be quick.


243
00:17:48.398 --> 00:17:49.898
Look, I like you, Arthur.

244
00:17:50.066 --> 00:17:51.483
You know, a lot of the guys,

245
00:17:51.568 --> 00:17:52.776
they think you're a freak,
but I like you.


246
00:17:54.112 --> 00:17:55.738
I don't even know
why I like you.


247
00:17:56.448 --> 00:17:58.032
But I got another complaint.

248
00:17:58.742 --> 00:18:01.535
It's starting to piss me off.
Kenny's Music.


249
00:18:01.703 --> 00:18:03.537
The guy said you disappeared.

250
00:18:03.705 --> 00:18:05.080
Never even returned his sign.

251
00:18:05.957 --> 00:18:07.750
Because I got jumped.

252
00:18:08.126 --> 00:18:09.835
Didn't you hear?

253
00:18:10.003 --> 00:18:11.754
For a sign?

254
00:18:11.921 --> 00:18:14.089
That's bullshit.
It doesn't even make sense.


255
00:18:14.257 --> 00:18:16.216
Just get him his sign back.

256
00:18:16.384 --> 00:18:18.761
He's going out of business,
for God's sake, Arthur.


257
00:18:18.928 --> 00:18:20.721
Why would I keep his sign?

258
00:18:20.889 --> 00:18:23.640
How the fuck do I know?
Why does anybody do anything?


259
00:18:24.934 --> 00:18:26.935
If you don't return the sign,

260
00:18:27.103 --> 00:18:29.146
I gotta take it
out of your paycheck.


261
00:18:30.231 --> 00:18:31.357
Are we clear?

262
00:18:32.901 --> 00:18:35.652
Listen,
I'm trying to help you.


263
00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:37.780
Okay? And I'll tell you
something else.


264
00:18:37.947 --> 00:18:39.323
The other guys,

265
00:18:39.407 --> 00:18:41.158
they don't feel comfortable
around you, Arthur,


266
00:18:41.326 --> 00:18:43.285
because people
think you're weird.


267
00:18:43.453 --> 00:18:46.288
Okay? And I can't
have that around me.


268
00:19:36.089 --> 00:19:37.131
Wait, wait, wait.

269
00:19:37.298 --> 00:19:38.298
Wait.

270
00:19:41.553 --> 00:19:42.678
Thank you.

271
00:20:04.701 --> 00:20:07.286
This building is so awful,
isn't it?


272
00:20:09.164 --> 00:20:11.623
This building is so awful,
right, Mommy?


273
00:20:11.791 --> 00:20:14.209
Yes, we can hear you, GiGi.

274
00:20:14.377 --> 00:20:16.712
It's so awful, Mommy.

275
00:20:18.423 --> 00:20:19.423
Right, Mommy?

276
00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:28.891
- Good night.
- This building's


277
00:20:29.058 --> 00:20:30.100
so awful, isn't it?

278
00:20:35.732 --> 00:20:36.732
Hey.

279
00:20:43.448 --> 00:20:44.448
Come on.

280
00:20:54.292 --> 00:20:58.045
<i>The moon is a silver dollar</i>

281
00:20:58.588 --> 00:21:01.131
<i>Shining up in the sky</i>

282
00:21:01.925 --> 00:21:03.759
<i>That's the dream we can buy...</i>

283
00:21:03.843 --> 00:21:04.843
Look up.

284
00:21:05.303 --> 00:21:07.304
Maybe the mailman's
throwing them away.


285
00:21:07.472 --> 00:21:10.349
Mom, why are these letters
so important to you?


286
00:21:11.267 --> 00:21:12.476
What do you think
he's gonna do?


287
00:21:12.644 --> 00:21:13.977
He's gonna help us.

288
00:21:14.896 --> 00:21:19.066
But you worked for him,
what, 30 years ago?


289
00:21:19.234 --> 00:21:21.109
Why would he help us?

290
00:21:21.277 --> 00:21:23.862
Because Thomas Wayne
is a good man.


291
00:21:24.739 --> 00:21:27.324
If he knew how we were living,

292
00:21:27.492 --> 00:21:30.953
if he saw this place,
it would make him sick.


293
00:21:32.330 --> 00:21:34.998
I can't explain it to you
any better than that.


294
00:21:36.876 --> 00:21:38.752
I don't want you worrying
about money, Mom.


295
00:21:40.088 --> 00:21:41.213
Or me.

296
00:21:41.673 --> 00:21:42.839
Everybody's telling me

297
00:21:42.924 --> 00:21:45.551
that my stand-up's
ready for the big clubs.


298
00:21:46.761 --> 00:21:49.346
But, Happy, what makes you
think you could do that?


299
00:21:49.847 --> 00:21:51.557
- What do you mean?
- I mean...


300
00:21:52.725 --> 00:21:55.018
Don't you have to be funny
to be a comedian?


301
00:22:24.882 --> 00:22:26.842
<i>Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom</i>

302
00:22:26.926 --> 00:22:29.261
<i>The world is in a mess</i>

303
00:22:29.345 --> 00:22:31.638
<i>With politics and taxes
And people grinding axes</i>


304
00:22:31.723 --> 00:22:32.889
<i>There's no happiness</i>

305
00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:36.435
<i>Happiness is not a riddle</i>

306
00:22:36.519 --> 00:22:39.313
<i>When I'm listening to that
Big bass fiddle</i>


307
00:22:50.325 --> 00:22:52.659
<i>Slap that bass
Slap it till its dizzy</i>


308
00:22:52.744 --> 00:22:55.078
<i>Slap that bass
Keep the rhythm busy</i>


309
00:22:55.163 --> 00:22:57.956
<i>Zoom, zoom, zoom
Misery, you've got to go...</i>


310
00:22:58.666 --> 00:22:59.916
Hey, what's your name?

311
00:23:01.127 --> 00:23:02.127
Arthur.

312
00:23:03.129 --> 00:23:06.381
Hey, Arthur,
you're a really good dancer.


313
00:23:07.091 --> 00:23:08.216
I know.

314
00:23:08.885 --> 00:23:11.011
You know who's not?
Him.


315
00:23:16.643 --> 00:23:18.560
Happy, what was that?
Are you okay?


316
00:23:18.728 --> 00:23:19.770
Mom, what?

317
00:23:19.937 --> 00:23:22.064
That noise!
Did you hear that noise?


318
00:23:22.231 --> 00:23:24.483
I'm watching an old war movie!

319
00:23:24.651 --> 00:23:26.151
Turn it down!

320
00:23:32.533 --> 00:23:34.201
Sorry, Mom.

321
00:23:46.923 --> 00:23:48.048
You good?

322
00:24:55.408 --> 00:24:57.951
It's nice to see these couples
out at my show.


323
00:24:58.911 --> 00:25:01.121
I have a wife.
We love to role-play.


324
00:25:01.205 --> 00:25:03.915
- Ooh!
- Yes, yes, very sexy.


325
00:25:04.083 --> 00:25:05.584
My favorite one right now is

326
00:25:05.752 --> 00:25:08.712
professor and senior
who really needs


327
00:25:08.796 --> 00:25:10.130
to pass my class to graduate.

328
00:25:11.299 --> 00:25:12.549
Yes.

329
00:25:14.010 --> 00:25:15.385
So, I'll tell you
how I operate.


330
00:25:15.553 --> 00:25:16.678
I'm a professor at

331
00:25:16.763 --> 00:25:18.221
a prestigious
New England university...


332
00:25:19.807 --> 00:25:23.685
...and my wife is a senior
in my "Intro To Western Civ. "


333
00:25:25.730 --> 00:25:26.897
I know. I know.

334
00:25:27.482 --> 00:25:30.233
Why is she a senior in the
intro? I didn't buy it either.


335
00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:33.195
So, she comes to me
during my office hours.


336
00:25:34.363 --> 00:25:35.947
It's Monday and Wednesday,
three to five.


337
00:25:36.073 --> 00:25:38.325
She says,
"Excuse me, Professor Lewis. "


338
00:25:38.493 --> 00:25:40.410
I can't use my real last name
at this college


339
00:25:40.578 --> 00:25:42.120
'cause they don't hire Jews.

340
00:25:43.956 --> 00:25:45.207
It's something I'll address

341
00:25:45.291 --> 00:25:46.917
once I have tenure,
but for now...


342
00:25:47.627 --> 00:25:49.252
She says,
"Excuse me, Professor Lewis,


343
00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:50.587
I think I might be
in danger of failing


344
00:25:50.671 --> 00:25:51.880
your 'Intro to Western Civ,'

345
00:25:52.048 --> 00:25:53.173
and I just want you to know

346
00:25:53.257 --> 00:25:55.008
I'm willing to do
anything to pass. "


347
00:25:55.802 --> 00:25:59.221
And I said, "Anything?"
And she said...


348
00:27:05.955 --> 00:27:07.998
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.


349
00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.542
Were you following me today?

350
00:27:14.088 --> 00:27:15.839
Yeah.

351
00:27:17.717 --> 00:27:19.551
I thought that was you.

352
00:27:20.386 --> 00:27:22.804
I was hoping you'd come in
and rob the place.


353
00:27:24.849 --> 00:27:26.391
I have a gun.

354
00:27:26.559 --> 00:27:28.184
I could come by tomorrow.

355
00:27:31.647 --> 00:27:33.106
You're so funny, Arthur.

356
00:27:35.359 --> 00:27:36.651
Yeah.

357
00:27:36.819 --> 00:27:39.321
You know,
I do stand-up comedy.


358
00:27:39.488 --> 00:27:42.240
You should maybe
come see a show sometime.


359
00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:44.284
I could do that.

360
00:27:44.452 --> 00:27:45.577
Yeah?

361
00:27:45.745 --> 00:27:47.537
Yeah. You'll let me know when?

362
00:27:47.705 --> 00:27:48.705
Yeah.

363
00:27:55.630 --> 00:27:57.839
<i>Ifyou're happy
and you know it</i>


364
00:27:57.924 --> 00:27:59.090
<i>Wiggle your ears</i>

365
00:27:59.175 --> 00:28:00.175

371
00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:11.561

372

00:28:17.693 --> 00:28:18.693

391
00:28:45.638 --> 00:28:49.265
Hoyt, please, I love this job.

392
00:28:49.433 --> 00:28:51.643
<i>Arthur, I need to know why</i>

393
00:28:51.727 --> 00:28:53.853
<i>you brought a gun
into a kids' hospital.</i>


394
00:28:54.021 --> 00:28:56.982
It's a prop.
It's part of my act now.


395
00:28:57.149 --> 00:28:58.984
<i>That's bullshit. Bullshit.</i>

396
00:28:59.151 --> 00:29:01.236
<i>What kind of clown
carries a fucking gun?</i>


397
00:29:01.946 --> 00:29:03.363
<i>Besides, Randall told me</i>

398
00:29:03.447 --> 00:29:06.408
<i>you tried to buy a. 38
off him last week.</i>


399
00:29:06.575 --> 00:29:07.617
Randall told you that?

400
00:29:07.785 --> 00:29:10.912
<i>You're a fuck-up, Arthur,
and a liar.</i>


401
00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:12.080
<i>You're fired!</i>

402
00:29:38.315 --> 00:29:39.482
<i>Jefferson Street.</i>

403
00:29:39.567 --> 00:29:41.067
<i>Next stop, Ninth Ave.</i>

404
00:29:44.071 --> 00:29:45.447
I'm telling you,
she wanted my number.


405
00:29:45.531 --> 00:29:46.656
We should've just stayed.

406
00:29:46.824 --> 00:29:49.492
You're dreaming, man.
She wasn't interested at all.


407
00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:51.870
Are you nuts? Did you
see how close we were dancing?


408
00:29:52.038 --> 00:29:53.121
She was in love.

409
00:29:53.289 --> 00:29:54.748
She couldn't wait to
get away from you.


410
00:29:54.915 --> 00:29:57.250
Ryan! Ryan, am I crazy?
Tell him what you saw.


411
00:29:59.837 --> 00:30:01.629
Hey,
you want some French fries?


412
00:30:04.383 --> 00:30:05.967
Hello?

413
00:30:07.344 --> 00:30:08.428
Talking to you. Hey.

414
00:30:08.596 --> 00:30:10.138
No, thank you.

415
00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:14.350
You sure?

416
00:30:16.228 --> 00:30:17.353
They're real good.

417
00:30:20.191 --> 00:30:22.942
Don't ignore him.
He's being nice to you.


418
00:30:49.929 --> 00:30:51.554
Is something funny, asshole?

419
00:30:55.768 --> 00:30:57.143
Bitch!

420
00:31:03.901 --> 00:31:06.903
Isn't it rich?

421
00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:10.198
<i>Are we a pair?</i>

422
00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:15.328
<i>Me here at last on the ground</i>

423
00:31:15.496 --> 00:31:18.498
<i>And you in mid-air</i>

424
00:31:18.666 --> 00:31:21.668
<i>Send in the clowns</i>

425
00:31:25.798 --> 00:31:27.590
<i>Isn't it bliss?</i>

426
00:31:29.051 --> 00:31:31.052
<i>Don't you approve?</i>

427
00:31:32.054 --> 00:31:34.222
<i>One who keeps tearing around</i>

428
00:31:34.390 --> 00:31:37.225
<i>And one who can't move</i>

429
00:31:37.393 --> 00:31:40.562
<i>Where are the clowns?</i>

430
00:31:40.729 --> 00:31:44.440
<i>There ought to be clowns</i>

431
00:31:54.285 --> 00:31:57.120
So, buddy, tell us,
what's so fucking funny?


432
00:31:57.288 --> 00:31:58.913
Nothing.

433
00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:04.252
I have... I have a condition.

434
00:32:04.962 --> 00:32:06.921
I'll tell you what you have,
you asshole.


435
00:32:10.593 --> 00:32:12.010
Please, stop!

436
00:32:13.012 --> 00:32:15.013
We got a kicker?

437
00:32:15.181 --> 00:32:16.973
Hey, hold him steady.
Hold him steady.


438
00:32:19.476 --> 00:32:21.144
Stay down, freak!

439
00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:41.539
Hey!

440
00:33:04.063 --> 00:33:05.104
<i>Ninth Avenue.</i>

441
00:33:05.189 --> 00:33:06.356
<i>Next stop, Hunter's Point.</i>

442
00:33:06.523 --> 00:33:07.857
Hey!

443
00:33:13.948 --> 00:33:15.740
<i>Stand clear of
the closing doors.</i>


444
00:33:52.736 --> 00:33:55.280
Shit. Shit.

445
00:36:48.787 --> 00:36:50.746
I read it was
a guy in full makeup.


446
00:36:50.914 --> 00:36:53.374
No, it says right here
it was a mask.


447
00:36:53.542 --> 00:36:55.668
Either way, I think
it's good for business.


448
00:36:55.836 --> 00:36:58.171
They got clowns on the front
of every newspaper.


449
00:36:58.338 --> 00:36:59.547
Big man, what's the good word?

450
00:36:59.715 --> 00:37:00.715
Hey.

451
00:37:03.844 --> 00:37:06.053
Hey, Arthur,
I heard what happened.


452
00:37:06.221 --> 00:37:07.513
Sorry, mate.

453
00:37:07.681 --> 00:37:08.681
Yeah.

454
00:37:09.349 --> 00:37:10.600
It doesn't seem fair,

455
00:37:10.767 --> 00:37:12.643
getting fired like that.

456
00:37:13.854 --> 00:37:14.937
Did you really bring a gun

457
00:37:15.022 --> 00:37:16.439
to the children's hospital,
Artie?


458
00:37:17.524 --> 00:37:18.983
What the fuck
would you do that for?


459
00:37:19.151 --> 00:37:20.443
Is that part of
your new act, Arthur?


460
00:37:20.611 --> 00:37:21.652
If your dancing
doesn't do the trick,


461
00:37:21.737 --> 00:37:22.904
you're just gonna
shoot yourself?


462
00:37:24.406 --> 00:37:25.781
Why don't you
ask Randall about it?


463
00:37:26.783 --> 00:37:27.909
It was his gun.

464
00:37:28.368 --> 00:37:29.869
- What?
- I still owe you for that,


465
00:37:29.953 --> 00:37:30.995
don't I?

466
00:37:31.163 --> 00:37:32.914
What the fuck
are you talking about?


467
00:37:33.457 --> 00:37:35.249
Stop talking
out of your ass, Art.


468
00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:41.756
Oh, no!

469
00:37:43.509 --> 00:37:45.218
I forgot to punch out.

470
00:37:51.683 --> 00:37:53.684
<i>And turns to sorrow</i>

<i>And as our city

474
00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:21.420

475

<i>we're joined by Thomas Wayne.</i>

476
00:38:23.257 --> 00:38:25.508
Happy, look,
Thomas Wayne's on TV.


477
00:38:25.676 --> 00:38:26.842
Yes, Mother.

478
00:38:27.010 --> 00:38:28.261
<i>Thanks for
having me on, Chuck.</i>


479
00:38:28.428 --> 00:38:29.720
They're asking him about

480
00:38:29.805 --> 00:38:31.264
those horrible subway murders.

481
00:38:31.431 --> 00:38:32.682
<i>Thank you, Thomas.
I know</i>


482
00:38:32.766 --> 00:38:34.517
<i>this is a difficult time
for you.</i>


483
00:38:34.685 --> 00:38:36.352
Why him?

484
00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:38.396
Looks like he's gained weight.

485
00:38:38.564 --> 00:38:40.273
<i>Yes, all three worked
for Wayne Investments.</i>


486
00:38:40.983 --> 00:38:42.650
<i>Good, decent, educated.</i>

487
00:38:42.818 --> 00:38:45.444
<i>Although I didn't know
any of them personally.</i>


488
00:38:47.155 --> 00:38:48.573
<i>Like all Wayne employees,</i>

489
00:38:48.657 --> 00:38:50.950
<i>past and present,
they're family.</i>


490
00:38:51.118 --> 00:38:52.785
Did you hear that?
I told you, we're family.


491
00:38:52.869 --> 00:38:54.287
There now seems to be

492
00:38:54.371 --> 00:38:56.622
<i>a groundswell of anti-rich
sentiment in the city.</i>


493
00:38:56.790 --> 00:38:58.958
<i>It's almost as if
our less fortunate residents</i>


494
00:38:59.042 --> 00:39:01.252
<i>are taking the side
of the killer.</i>


495
00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:03.087
Yes, and it's a shame.

496
00:39:03.255 --> 00:39:04.547
<i>It's one of the reasons why</i>

497
00:39:04.631 --> 00:39:05.840
<i>I'm considering
a run for mayor.</i>


498
00:39:06.717 --> 00:39:08.926
<i>Gotham's lost its way.</i>

499
00:39:09.094 --> 00:39:10.845
<i>What about
the eyewitness report</i>


500
00:39:10.929 --> 00:39:13.639
<i>of the suspect being
a man in a clown mask?</i>


501
00:39:13.807 --> 00:39:15.808
<i>Well,
it makes total sense to me.</i>


502
00:39:15.976 --> 00:39:18.185
<i>What kind of coward would do
something that cold-blooded?</i>


503
00:39:18.353 --> 00:39:20.187
<i>Someone who hides
behind a mask.</i>


504
00:39:20.772 --> 00:39:22.231
<i>Someone who is envious</i>

505
00:39:22.316 --> 00:39:25.735
<i>of those more fortunate
than themselves,</i>


506
00:39:26.445 --> 00:39:29.238
<i>yet they're too scared
to show their own face.</i>


507
00:39:29.406 --> 00:39:32.325
<i>And until those kind of people
change for the better,</i>


508
00:39:32.492 --> 00:39:36.078
<i>those of us who have
made something of our lives</i>


509
00:39:36.246 --> 00:39:38.581
<i>will always look
at those who haven't</i>


510
00:39:38.749 --> 00:39:40.875
<i>as nothing but clowns.</i>

511
00:39:42.502 --> 00:39:44.962
<i>Thomas Wayne, thank you
for coming in this morning.</i>


512
00:39:45.130 --> 00:39:46.130
It's not funny.

513
00:40:07.861 --> 00:40:10.112
I heard this song on the radio
the other day,


514
00:40:12.949 --> 00:40:16.952
and the guy was singing
that his name was Carnival.


515
00:40:18.121 --> 00:40:19.205
Arthur...

516
00:40:19.373 --> 00:40:20.539
Which is crazy,

517
00:40:22.918 --> 00:40:25.961
because that's
my clown name at work.


518
00:40:27.047 --> 00:40:29.507
And until a little while ago,

519
00:40:30.759 --> 00:40:33.260
it was like
nobody ever saw me.


520
00:40:35.305 --> 00:40:37.682
Even I didn't know
if I really existed.


521
00:40:38.100 --> 00:40:40.476
Arthur, I have
some bad news for you.


522
00:40:43.814 --> 00:40:45.231
You don't listen, do you?

523
00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:50.903
I don't think
you ever really hear me.


524
00:40:51.988 --> 00:40:54.782
You just ask
the same questions every week.


525
00:40:54.950 --> 00:40:58.244
"How's your job? Are you
having any negative thoughts?"


526
00:40:59.287 --> 00:41:02.998
All I have are
negative thoughts,


527
00:41:03.166 --> 00:41:06.001
but you don't listen anyway.

528
00:41:06.169 --> 00:41:09.547
I said, for my whole life,

529
00:41:09.715 --> 00:41:12.925
I didn't know
if I even really existed.


530
00:41:14.136 --> 00:41:15.845
But I do.

531
00:41:17.305 --> 00:41:21.225
And people are
starting to notice.


532
00:41:22.978 --> 00:41:24.729
They've cut our funding.

533
00:41:24.896 --> 00:41:26.564
We're closing down
our offices next week.


534
00:41:28.275 --> 00:41:30.192
The city has cut funding
across the board.


535
00:41:30.277 --> 00:41:32.236
Social Services is
part of that.


536
00:41:32.404 --> 00:41:34.447
This is the last time
we'll be meeting.


537
00:41:35.407 --> 00:41:36.574
Okay.

538
00:41:40.787 --> 00:41:42.788
They don't give a shit
about people like you, Arthur.


539
00:41:45.041 --> 00:41:46.459
And they really
don't give a shit


540
00:41:46.543 --> 00:41:48.502
about people like me, either.

541
00:41:51.757 --> 00:41:53.090
Fuck.

542
00:42:01.308 --> 00:42:03.809
How am I supposed to
get my medication now?


543
00:42:06.813 --> 00:42:08.397
Who do I talk to?

544
00:42:10.859 --> 00:42:12.651
I'm sorry, Arthur.

545
00:42:15.447 --> 00:42:18.991
<i>I think... I think most women
look at sex like buying a car.</i>


546
00:42:19.659 --> 00:42:22.077
<i>You know, like, "Can I see
myself in this long-term?"</i>


547
00:42:22.245 --> 00:42:24.246
<i>"Is it safe?"</i>

548
00:42:24.414 --> 00:42:25.873
<i>"Is it reliable?"</i>

549
00:42:26.041 --> 00:42:28.292
<i>"Could it kill me?"</i>

550
00:42:28.376 --> 00:42:30.419
<i>Most guys, we look at sex
like parking a car.</i>


551
00:42:30.587 --> 00:42:32.963
<i>We're like, "There's a spot. "</i>

552
00:42:33.131 --> 00:42:34.256
<i>"There's another spot.</i>

553
00:42:34.341 --> 00:42:35.424
<i>"That would work. "</i>

554
00:42:35.592 --> 00:42:38.093
<i>"Oh, I have to pay?
Never mind. "</i>


555
00:42:39.763 --> 00:42:42.515
<i>"Handicapped?
I hope no one sees this. "</i>


556
00:42:45.227 --> 00:42:47.436
<i>All right, that's my time.
Thank you very much, guys.</i>


557
00:42:52.609 --> 00:42:54.777
One more time
for Sam Morril, y'all.


558
00:42:56.071 --> 00:42:57.863
All right, now,
this next comic describes


559
00:42:57.948 --> 00:43:00.074
himself as
a lifelong Gotham resident


560
00:43:00.242 --> 00:43:02.618
who from a young age
was always told


561
00:43:02.702 --> 00:43:03.744
that his purpose in life

562
00:43:03.912 --> 00:43:07.915
was to bring laughter and joy
into this cold, dark world.


563
00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:09.834
Okay.

564
00:43:10.001 --> 00:43:12.253
Please help me welcome
Arthur Fleck, y'all.


565
00:43:12.337 --> 00:43:13.379
Arthur Fleck.

566
00:43:37.696 --> 00:43:40.239
Hello, it's good to be here.

567
00:44:05.015 --> 00:44:07.975
I hated school
when I was a kid.


568
00:44:23.491 --> 00:44:28.287
I hated school as a kid.

569
00:44:29.581 --> 00:44:31.248
My mother would say,

570
00:44:31.416 --> 00:44:32.917
"You should enjoy it.

571
00:44:33.001 --> 00:44:35.044
One day, you'll have to
work for a living. "


572
00:44:36.504 --> 00:44:37.755
"No, I won't, Ma,

573
00:44:37.839 --> 00:44:39.506
I'm gonna be a comedian. "

574
00:44:52.145 --> 00:44:53.270
Here's one.

575
00:44:54.689 --> 00:44:57.608
You know, I was
just thinking the other day,


576
00:44:57.692 --> 00:44:59.652
why are the rich people...

577
00:45:06.242 --> 00:45:07.576
<i>Smile though your heart is aching</i>

578
00:45:10.997 --> 00:45:15.376
<i>Smile even though it's breaking</i>

579
00:45:17.712 --> 00:45:23.425
<i>When there are clouds in the sky
You'll get by</i>


580
00:45:23.927 --> 00:45:28.973
<i>If you smile
Through your fear and sorrow</i>


581
00:45:29.057 --> 00:45:34.103
<i>Smile and maybe tomorrow</i>

582
00:45:34.312 --> 00:45:40.067
<i>You'll see the sun
Come shining through for you</i>


583
00:45:40.151 --> 00:45:41.485
You believe that shit?

584
00:45:43.321 --> 00:45:44.321
Fuck 'em.

585
00:45:46.366 --> 00:45:48.993
I think the guy
that did it is a hero.


586
00:45:51.162 --> 00:45:52.997
Three less pricks
in Gotham City,


587
00:45:53.456 --> 00:45:55.374
only a million more to go.

588
00:45:57.043 --> 00:45:59.878
<i>You'll get by</i>

589
00:46:00.005 --> 00:46:04.216
<i>That's the time you must keep on trying</i>

590
00:46:04.801 --> 00:46:08.971
<i>Smile, what's the use of crying</i>

591
00:46:09.139 --> 00:46:13.600
<i>You'll find that
Life is still worthwhile</i>


592
00:46:15.854 --> 00:46:19.732
<i>If you just smile</i>

593
00:46:27.240 --> 00:46:28.615
<i>And, buddy, as always,</i>

594
00:46:28.700 --> 00:46:29.825
<i>thanks for the laughs.</i>

595
00:46:29.993 --> 00:46:31.493
<i>I'm sure we'll see you again.</i>

596
00:46:31.661 --> 00:46:32.870
<i>You know we'll be here, right?</i>

597
00:46:32.954 --> 00:46:34.246
<i>I hope.</i>

598
00:46:34.330 --> 00:46:38.000
<i>Tomorrow night, we have
Diana Hudson, Greg Gordon,</i>


599
00:46:38.168 --> 00:46:40.961
<i>and animal expert,
Hugh Little.</i>


600
00:46:41.629 --> 00:46:42.921
<i>Thanks for watching.</i>

601
00:46:43.089 --> 00:46:45.382
<i>Good night,
and always remember,</i>


602
00:46:45.550 --> 00:46:46.925
<i>that's life.</i>

603
00:46:51.264 --> 00:46:52.431
That's life.

604
00:46:57.270 --> 00:47:00.647
Momma, time to wake up
and go to bed.


605
00:47:00.732 --> 00:47:01.857
Oh...

606
00:47:04.110 --> 00:47:05.569
Oh, Happy.

607
00:47:08.406 --> 00:47:10.074
Happy, I wrote a new letter.

608
00:47:10.241 --> 00:47:11.950
Come on, dance with me.

609
00:47:12.952 --> 00:47:15.329
For Thomas Wayne.
It's important.


610
00:47:24.255 --> 00:47:25.964
You smell like cologne.

611
00:47:26.132 --> 00:47:28.592
It's 'cause
I just had a big date.


612
00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:30.552
Oh.

613
00:47:33.264 --> 00:47:35.015
Just don't forget to mail it.

614
00:48:00.834 --> 00:48:02.501
<i>The Murray Franklin
Show is taped live</i>


615

617
00:49:08.610 --> 00:49:11.195
You're gonna kill me. You're
gonna give me a heart attack!


618
00:49:11.362 --> 00:49:12.529
Don't give me your...

619
00:49:12.697 --> 00:49:14.531
No. No.

620
00:49:14.699 --> 00:49:17.659
I'm not talking to you
until you stop being angry!


621
00:49:17.827 --> 00:49:18.994
Okay.

622
00:49:19.162 --> 00:49:20.245
Okay.

623
00:49:24.959 --> 00:49:27.085
I'm not angry, Mom.

624
00:49:27.253 --> 00:49:29.588
I'm not angry.

625
00:49:29.756 --> 00:49:30.964
Please.

626
00:49:32.008 --> 00:49:34.760
Mom, is this real?

627
00:49:38.431 --> 00:49:41.642
He's an extraordinary man,
Happy.


628
00:49:41.809 --> 00:49:44.144
He's a very powerful man.

629
00:49:45.688 --> 00:49:47.648
We were in love.

630
00:49:48.524 --> 00:49:50.442
He said it was best that
we not be together


631
00:49:50.526 --> 00:49:52.653
because of appearances.

632
00:49:55.114 --> 00:49:58.492
And I could never
tell anyone because...


633
00:50:01.037 --> 00:50:02.496
Well, I signed some papers.

634
00:50:04.332 --> 00:50:05.958
And besides, you can imagine

635
00:50:06.042 --> 00:50:09.419
what people would say
about Thomas and me.


636
00:50:12.131 --> 00:50:13.507
What they'd say about you.

637
00:50:17.720 --> 00:50:19.638
What would they say, Mom?

638
00:52:52.875 --> 00:52:53.917
Hi.

639
00:52:56.879 --> 00:52:58.255
What's your name?

640
00:52:59.507 --> 00:53:01.133
I'm Bruce.

641
00:53:02.218 --> 00:53:03.385
Bruce.

642
00:53:05.346 --> 00:53:06.596
I'm Arthur.

643
00:53:28.578 --> 00:53:29.953
That's better.

644
00:53:30.872 --> 00:53:32.456
Bruce! Bruce!

645
00:53:33.958 --> 00:53:35.125
Get away from that man.

646
00:53:35.293 --> 00:53:37.419
It's okay. I'm a good guy.

647
00:53:37.587 --> 00:53:38.837
What are you doing?
Who are you?


648
00:53:39.464 --> 00:53:41.131
I'm here to see Mr. Wayne.

649
00:53:41.299 --> 00:53:43.800
Well, you shouldn't be
speaking to his son.


650
00:53:45.219 --> 00:53:46.386
Why did you give him
these flowers?


651
00:53:46.554 --> 00:53:47.762
No, they're not real.

652
00:53:49.515 --> 00:53:51.558
It's magic.

653
00:53:52.018 --> 00:53:53.435
I was just trying to
make him smile.


654
00:53:53.603 --> 00:53:55.437
Well, it's not funny, is it?

655
00:53:56.439 --> 00:53:57.647
Do I need to call the police?

656
00:53:57.815 --> 00:53:59.232
No. Please.

657
00:54:00.526 --> 00:54:03.737
My mother's name is Penny.
Penny Fleck.


658
00:54:03.905 --> 00:54:04.988
She used to work here
years ago.


659
00:54:05.156 --> 00:54:07.240
Can you please tell Mr. Wayne
I need to see him?


660
00:54:08.409 --> 00:54:09.868
You are her son.

661
00:54:10.036 --> 00:54:11.036
Yeah.

662
00:54:11.704 --> 00:54:13.413
Did you know her?

663
00:54:17.043 --> 00:54:19.377
I know about the two of them.

664
00:54:19.962 --> 00:54:22.380
She told me everything.

665
00:54:24.258 --> 00:54:26.051
There's nothing to know.

666
00:54:27.178 --> 00:54:28.970
There is no "them. "

667
00:54:29.931 --> 00:54:32.098
Your mother was delusional.

668
00:54:33.017 --> 00:54:34.100
She was a sick woman.

669
00:54:34.268 --> 00:54:36.311
Don't say that.

670
00:54:37.480 --> 00:54:38.897
Just go.

671
00:54:40.149 --> 00:54:42.400
Before you
make a fool of yourself.


672
00:54:44.070 --> 00:54:46.738
Thomas Wayne is my father.

673
00:54:51.786 --> 00:54:52.786
He left me.

674
00:54:55.623 --> 00:54:56.915
Let go! Let go!

675
00:55:23.276 --> 00:55:25.110
Keep the respirations
above 15.


676
00:55:25.278 --> 00:55:27.445
Slow and steady.
We got some stairs coming up.


677
00:55:28.698 --> 00:55:29.906
Mom?

678
00:55:30.741 --> 00:55:31.741
What happened?

679
00:55:31.909 --> 00:55:33.577
- Who are you?
- I'm her son.


680
00:55:33.661 --> 00:55:35.161
- What happened?
- You can probably help us out inside.


681
00:55:35.246 --> 00:55:36.663
We don't know
what happened yet.


682
00:55:36.747 --> 00:55:38.665
- Hop in the back of the ambulance.
- Step.


683
00:55:38.749 --> 00:55:40.000
One more.
We got one more lift.


684
00:55:40.084 --> 00:55:41.126
I'm getting

685
00:55:41.210 --> 00:55:42.377
a little resistance here,
Michael.


686
00:55:45.131 --> 00:55:46.131
Lift.

687
00:55:51.679 --> 00:55:53.013
I'm right here.

688
00:55:53.389 --> 00:55:54.598
Excuse me, sir.

689
00:55:54.849 --> 00:55:55.890
Does your mother take
any medications?


690
00:55:55.975 --> 00:55:57.058
- No.
- Excuse me,


691
00:55:57.143 --> 00:55:58.184
- I couldn't hear you.
- No.


692
00:55:58.269 --> 00:55:59.853
Sir, when was the last time
you spoke to her?


693
00:55:59.937 --> 00:56:01.104
I don't know.

694
00:56:46.025 --> 00:56:47.233
Mr. Fleck.

695
00:56:48.611 --> 00:56:50.570
Sorry to bother you.
I'm Detective Garrity.


696
00:56:50.655 --> 00:56:52.947
This is my partner,
Detective Burke.


697
00:56:53.366 --> 00:56:56.034
We had a few questions for
you, but you weren't home,


698
00:56:57.536 --> 00:56:59.037
so we spoke with your mother.

699
00:57:00.790 --> 00:57:01.790
Oh.

700
00:57:02.958 --> 00:57:04.376
What did you say to her?

701
00:57:04.543 --> 00:57:05.543
Did you do this?

702
00:57:05.711 --> 00:57:06.711
What? No.

703
00:57:06.879 --> 00:57:09.339
No, no, no. We just
asked her some questions,


704
00:57:09.507 --> 00:57:11.007
and she got hysterical.

705
00:57:11.175 --> 00:57:12.926
Hyperventilating,

706
00:57:13.094 --> 00:57:14.219
collapsed and
hit her head pretty hard.


707
00:57:14.387 --> 00:57:16.513
Yeah. The doctor said
she had a stroke.


708
00:57:17.139 --> 00:57:18.973
We're sorry to
hear about that.


709
00:57:19.850 --> 00:57:22.686
But, like I said, I still have
some questions for you.


710
00:57:22.853 --> 00:57:24.104
They're about
the subway killings


711
00:57:24.188 --> 00:57:25.230
that happened last week.

712
00:57:25.398 --> 00:57:26.690
You've heard about them,
right?


713
00:57:26.857 --> 00:57:27.941
Yeah.

714
00:57:28.109 --> 00:57:29.109
It's horrible.

715
00:57:29.276 --> 00:57:30.485
Right.

716
00:57:31.445 --> 00:57:34.572
So, we spoke with your boss
over at Haha's.


717
00:57:34.740 --> 00:57:36.783
He said you were fired
for bringing a gun


718
00:57:36.867 --> 00:57:38.326
into the children's hospital.

719
00:57:39.829 --> 00:57:41.830
- Is that true, Mr. Fleck?
- It was a prop.


720
00:57:41.997 --> 00:57:43.540
It's part of my act.

721
00:57:43.958 --> 00:57:45.291
I'm a party clown.

722
00:57:45.459 --> 00:57:47.377
All right.
So, why were you fired?


723
00:57:50.673 --> 00:57:53.216
They said
I wasn't funny enough.


724
00:57:53.384 --> 00:57:55.343
Can you imagine that?

725
00:57:55.511 --> 00:57:59.347
If you don't mind, I have to
go take care of my mother.


726
00:57:59.515 --> 00:58:01.766
Your boss also
gave us one of your cards.


727
00:58:03.978 --> 00:58:06.312
This condition of yours,
the laughing,


728
00:58:07.064 --> 00:58:08.398
is it real,

729
00:58:08.566 --> 00:58:10.400
or some sort of clown thing?

730
00:58:10.943 --> 00:58:13.445
- A clown thing?
- Yeah.


731
00:58:13.863 --> 00:58:16.156
I mean,
is it part of your act?


732
00:58:18.743 --> 00:58:20.076
What do you think?

733
00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:27.083
It's exit only.

734
00:58:51.567 --> 00:58:53.568
She's gonna be okay.

735
00:58:58.032 --> 00:58:59.741
I'm gonna get a coffee.

736
00:59:00.451 --> 00:59:01.451
You want one?

737
00:59:01.619 --> 00:59:02.619
Yeah.

738
00:59:15.758 --> 00:59:18.718
<i>So, the other night,
I told my youngest son Billy,</i>


739
00:59:18.886 --> 00:59:21.346
<i>you know, the new one,
the not-so-bright one.</i>


740
00:59:22.181 --> 00:59:23.681
<i>I told him,
"The garbage strike</i>


741
00:59:23.766 --> 00:59:25.016
<i>is still going on, Billy. "</i>

742
00:59:25.226 --> 00:59:27.268
<i>And he says, and I'm
not kidding, Billy says,</i>


743
00:59:27.436 --> 00:59:29.145
<i>"So, where are we gonna get
all our garbage from?"</i>


744
00:59:36.779 --> 00:59:39.239
<i>And finally,
in a world where everyone</i>


745
00:59:39.323 --> 00:59:40.657
<i>thinks they could do my job,</i>

746
00:59:40.825 --> 00:59:43.034
<i>we got this video tape
from Pogo's Comedy Club,</i>


747
00:59:43.118 --> 00:59:44.244
<i>right here in Gotham.</i>

748
00:59:44.411 --> 00:59:46.329
<i>Here's a guy who thinks
if you just keep laughing,</i>


749
00:59:46.497 --> 00:59:48.206
<i>it'll somehow make you funny.</i>

750
00:59:48.290 --> 00:59:49.624
<i>Check out this joker.</i>

751
00:59:55.381 --> 00:59:56.422
Oh, my God.

752
00:59:56.507 --> 01:00:00.051
<i>I hated school as a kid.</i>

753
01:00:00.928 --> 01:00:03.972
<i>But my mother
would always say,</i>


754
01:00:04.139 --> 01:00:05.723
<i>"You should enjoy it.</i>

755
01:00:05.808 --> 01:00:07.934
<i>One day, you'll have to
work for a living. "</i>


756
01:00:08.727 --> 01:00:10.144
<i>"No, I won't, Ma.</i>

757
01:00:10.229 --> 01:00:11.938
<i>I'm gonna be a comedian. "</i>

758
01:00:18.279 --> 01:00:20.363
<i>You shoulda listened
to your mother.</i>


759
01:00:22.616 --> 01:00:24.200
<i>Hey, one more.
One more, Bobby.</i>


760
01:00:24.368 --> 01:00:26.786
<i>All right, let's see one more.
I love this guy.</i>


761
01:00:27.621 --> 01:00:28.621
It's funny,

762
01:00:29.498 --> 01:00:31.624
<i>when I was a little boy</i>

763
01:00:31.792 --> 01:00:34.627
<i>and told people
I was gonna be a comedian,</i>


764
01:00:34.795 --> 01:00:36.838
<i>everyone laughed at me.</i>

765
01:00:37.006 --> 01:00:39.799
<i>Well, no one's laughing now.</i>

766
01:00:43.304 --> 01:00:45.179
<i>You can say that again, pal.</i>

767
01:00:50.978 --> 01:00:53.813
<i>All right, we got a great show
for you tonight.</i>


768
01:00:53.981 --> 01:00:57.150
<i>Chuck Conby is here,
actress Joanne Mulligan,</i>


769
01:00:57.318 --> 01:01:01.154
<i>and new music from
Mel Rubin and the Stiffs.</i>


770
01:01:07.119 --> 01:01:09.662
<i>As tensions mount
around the metro area,</i>


771
01:01:09.830 --> 01:01:13.416
<i>Mayor Stokes has pleaded
for cooler heads to prevail.</i>


772
01:01:13.584 --> 01:01:15.168
<i>City services
have been affected,</i>


773
01:01:15.336 --> 01:01:17.337
<i>and some businesses
have decided</i>


774
01:01:17.421 --> 01:01:20.214
<i>to remain closed
amid the unrest.</i>


775
01:01:20.382 --> 01:01:22.967
<i>Chuck Stevens
filed this report.</i>


776
01:01:23.135 --> 01:01:24.302
<i>The anger and resentment</i>

777
01:01:24.386 --> 01:01:25.678
<i>that's been building
in the city for weeks</i>


778
01:01:25.846 --> 01:01:27.847
<i>seems close to exploding.</i>

779
01:01:28.015 --> 01:01:30.058
<i>Protesters,
many dressed as clowns,</i>


780
01:01:30.142 --> 01:01:31.267
<i>took to the streets today</i>

781
01:01:31.477 --> 01:01:33.269
<i>in one of
several planned demonstrations</i>


782
01:01:33.354 --> 01:01:34.896
<i>taking on the city's elite,</i>

783
01:01:35.064 --> 01:01:36.814
<i>including a massive rally
outside</i>


784
01:01:36.899 --> 01:01:39.317
<i>tomorrow night's
benefit at Wayne Hall.</i>


785
01:01:39.485 --> 01:01:40.610
<i>What's the point of all this?</i>

786
01:01:41.153 --> 01:01:42.987
the rich.
Thomas Wayne.


787
01:01:43.072 --> 01:01:44.614
<i>That's what this whole
thing is about.</i>


788
01:01:44.782 --> 01:01:46.658
the whole system.

789
01:01:46.825 --> 01:01:47.909
<i>Wayne,
who recently announced</i>


790
01:01:47.993 --> 01:01:49.202
<i>he is running for mayor,</i>

791
01:01:49.370 --> 01:01:51.079
<i>will be attending the benefit.</i>

792
01:01:51.246 --> 01:01:53.247
<i>You might remember
it was Thomas Wayne</i>


793
01:01:53.415 --> 01:01:54.791
<i>who first referred to</i>

794
01:01:54.875 --> 01:01:57.669
<i>many of Gotham's residents
as "clowns. "</i>


795
01:01:57.836 --> 01:02:00.838
<i>Today, he offered little in
the way of an apology.</i>


796
01:02:01.006 --> 01:02:02.256
<i>Well, what I will say is,</i>

797
01:02:02.341 --> 01:02:03.466
<i>there's something wrong
with those people.</i>


798
01:02:03.634 --> 01:02:04.634
<i>I am here to help them.</i>

799
01:02:04.802 --> 01:02:06.094
<i>I'm gonna
lift them out of poverty,</i>


800
01:02:06.178 --> 01:02:07.595
<i>help make their lives better.</i>

801
01:02:07.763 --> 01:02:08.930
<i>That is why I'm running.</i>

802
01:02:09.098 --> 01:02:11.849
<i>And they may not realize it,
but I'm their only hope.</i>


803
01:02:27.658 --> 01:02:30.368
Down with Wayne!
Down with Wayne!


804
01:02:30.452 --> 01:02:33.204
Down with Wayne!
Down with Wayne!


805
01:05:13.782 --> 01:05:14.866
Can I help you, pal?

806
01:05:17.119 --> 01:05:18.786
I don't know what to say.

807
01:05:22.416 --> 01:05:24.625
Do you want an autograph
or something?


808
01:05:24.793 --> 01:05:25.793
No.

809
01:05:31.925 --> 01:05:33.467
My name is Arthur.

810
01:05:35.053 --> 01:05:36.679
Penny Fleck is my mother.

811
01:05:38.056 --> 01:05:39.056
Jesus.

812
01:05:40.142 --> 01:05:41.767
You're the guy that came to
my house yesterday.


813
01:05:43.395 --> 01:05:44.645
Yes.

814
01:05:45.189 --> 01:05:47.064
I'm sorry I just showed up.

815
01:05:47.232 --> 01:05:48.691
But my mother
told me everything,


816
01:05:48.775 --> 01:05:50.443
and I had to talk to you.

817
01:05:50.611 --> 01:05:52.528
Look, pal,
I'm not your father.


818
01:05:53.155 --> 01:05:54.614
What's wrong with you?

819
01:05:56.283 --> 01:05:57.825
Look at us.

820
01:05:59.328 --> 01:06:00.578
I think you are.

821
01:06:00.746 --> 01:06:01.954
Well, that's impossible

822
01:06:02.539 --> 01:06:03.789
because you're adopted,

823
01:06:03.874 --> 01:06:04.999
and I never slept with
your mother.


824
01:06:05.125 --> 01:06:06.667
- I wasn't adopted.
- What do you want from me?


825
01:06:06.752 --> 01:06:08.127
- Money?
- No, I don't...


826
01:06:08.212 --> 01:06:09.337
I wasn't adopted.

827
01:06:09.504 --> 01:06:11.297
Jesus. She never told you?

828
01:06:11.465 --> 01:06:13.132
Told me what?

829
01:06:14.468 --> 01:06:16.302
Your mother adopted you
while she was working for us.


830
01:06:16.470 --> 01:06:17.678
That's not true.

831
01:06:18.222 --> 01:06:19.222
Why are you saying that?

832
01:06:19.389 --> 01:06:20.389
Then she was arrested
and committed


833
01:06:20.474 --> 01:06:21.641
to Arkham State Hospital,

834
01:06:21.808 --> 01:06:23.184
when you were
just a little boy.


835
01:06:23.352 --> 01:06:24.477
Why are you saying this?

836
01:06:24.645 --> 01:06:26.145
I don't need you to
tell me lies.


837
01:06:26.313 --> 01:06:27.647
I know it seems strange.

838
01:06:27.731 --> 01:06:29.357
I don't mean to
make you uncomfortable.


839
01:06:29.524 --> 01:06:31.108
I don't know
why everyone is so rude.


840
01:06:31.276 --> 01:06:32.485
I don't know why you are.

841
01:06:32.653 --> 01:06:33.986
I don't want
anything from you.


842
01:06:34.154 --> 01:06:36.530
Maybe a little bit of warmth,
maybe a hug, Dad!


843
01:06:36.698 --> 01:06:38.699
How about just a little bit
of fucking decency?


844
01:06:38.867 --> 01:06:40.243
What is it with you people?

845
01:06:40.410 --> 01:06:42.370
You say that stuff
about my mother.


846
01:06:42.537 --> 01:06:43.913
She's crazy.

847
01:06:43.997 --> 01:06:46.082
She's...

848
01:06:53.674 --> 01:06:55.049
You think this is funny?

849
01:06:56.677 --> 01:06:59.845
Dad, it's me. Come on.

850
01:07:02.557 --> 01:07:03.724
Touch my son again,

851
01:07:03.809 --> 01:07:05.184
I'll fucking kill you.

852
01:07:25.122 --> 01:07:27.915
<i>Hello, Mr. Fleck.
This is Detective Garrity.</i>


853
01:07:28.083 --> 01:07:30.418
<i>We met the other night
at Gotham General.</i>


854
01:07:30.585 --> 01:07:32.878
<i>My partner and I had a few
more questions for you.</i>


855
01:07:33.046 --> 01:07:35.965
<i>We stopped by your apartment
today, but you weren't home.</i>


856
01:07:36.133 --> 01:07:37.883
<i>Please give me a call
when you get this message.</i>


857
01:07:38.051 --> 01:07:39.969
<i>Again, Detective Garrity,</i>

858
01:07:40.137 --> 01:07:44.140
<i>and my number is 212... 99.</i>

859
01:08:27.184 --> 01:08:29.018
<i>This message is
for Arthur Fleck.</i>


860
01:08:29.186 --> 01:08:30.895
<i>My name is Shirley Woods.</i>

861
01:08:30.979 --> 01:08:33.147
<i>I work on
The Murray Franklin Show.</i>


862
01:08:33.315 --> 01:08:34.315
<i>I don't know if you're aware,</i>

863
01:08:34.483 --> 01:08:36.025
<i>but Murray played
a clip of your stand-up</i>


864
01:08:36.109 --> 01:08:37.151
<i>on the show recently,</i>

865
01:08:37.319 --> 01:08:40.613
<i>and we have gotten an amazing
response from our viewers.</i>


866
01:08:40.781 --> 01:08:42.990
<i>Murray asked me to give you
a call and see if you're...</i>


867
01:08:47.412 --> 01:08:48.746
Who is this?

868
01:08:48.914 --> 01:08:50.539
<i>Oh, hi, this is Shirley Woods.</i>

869
01:08:50.707 --> 01:08:53.501
<i>I'm the show booker from
Live with Murray Franklin.</i>


870
01:08:53.668 --> 01:08:54.710
<i>Is this Arthur?</i>

871
01:08:56.713 --> 01:08:57.713
Yes.

872
01:08:57.881 --> 01:08:59.840
<i>Hi, Arthur.
Well, as I was saying,</i>


873
01:08:59.925 --> 01:09:01.926
<i>we've gotten a lot of calls
about your clip.</i>


874
01:09:02.094 --> 01:09:03.803
<i>Amazing responses.</i>

875
01:09:03.970 --> 01:09:06.263
<i>And Murray asked
if I would reach out to you</i>


876
01:09:06.348 --> 01:09:07.973
<i>to see if you would
come on as his guest.</i>


877
01:09:13.271 --> 01:09:16.399
Murray wants me
on The Murray Franklin Show?


878
01:09:16.566 --> 01:09:18.150
<i>Yeah. Isn't that great?</i>

879
01:09:18.318 --> 01:09:21.195
<i>He'd love to talk to you,
maybe do some of your act?</i>


880
01:09:22.197 --> 01:09:24.365
<i>That sound good to you?</i>

881
01:09:28.703 --> 01:09:30.746
Yeah, that sounds great.

882
01:09:30.914 --> 01:09:32.748
<i>Can we set up a date
right now?</i>


883
01:09:32.833 --> 01:09:34.542
<i>Are you available
next Thursday?</i>


884
01:10:27.262 --> 01:10:28.262
Hey.

885
01:10:29.097 --> 01:10:32.057
Man,
I'm sorry about that, my man.


886
01:10:32.225 --> 01:10:34.351
All records 10 years or older,
they store in the basement,


887
01:10:34.519 --> 01:10:37.521
and you're talking about
something 30 years ago, so...


888
01:10:38.899 --> 01:10:40.858
Can I ask you a question?

889
01:10:41.026 --> 01:10:42.234
Sure.

890
01:10:42.819 --> 01:10:46.739
How does someone
wind up in here?


891
01:10:47.824 --> 01:10:51.327
Have they all, all the people
committed crimes?


892
01:10:51.953 --> 01:10:53.621
Well, yeah, some have.

893
01:10:53.788 --> 01:10:56.665
You know, some are just crazy.

894
01:10:56.833 --> 01:10:59.293
Pose dangers to
themselves and others.


895
01:10:59.461 --> 01:11:01.045
Some just got
nowhere else to go.


896
01:11:01.129 --> 01:11:03.214
Don't know what to do,
you know?


897
01:11:03.381 --> 01:11:07.051
Yeah. I hear you, brother.

898
01:11:07.135 --> 01:11:09.970
Sometimes,
I don't know what to do.


899
01:11:11.515 --> 01:11:14.183
Last time, I ended up taking
it out on some people.


900
01:11:15.644 --> 01:11:19.271
I thought it was gonna bother
me, but it really hasn't.


901
01:11:20.607 --> 01:11:21.607
What's that?

902
01:11:23.151 --> 01:11:26.529
I fucked up and
did some bad shit.


903
01:11:30.450 --> 01:11:31.492
You know
what I'm talking about,


904
01:11:31.660 --> 01:11:36.997
it's so hard to just try and
be happy all the time.


905
01:11:39.084 --> 01:11:40.793
Hey, listen, man.

906
01:11:41.795 --> 01:11:43.254
I'm just
an administrative assistant.


907
01:11:43.338 --> 01:11:44.838
Like a clerk, you know.

908
01:11:45.006 --> 01:11:46.590
All I do is file paperwork.

909
01:11:47.717 --> 01:11:49.426
I don't know what to tell you.

910
01:11:49.594 --> 01:11:51.387
But you should see somebody.

911
01:11:51.555 --> 01:11:52.805
You know, they got programs,

912
01:11:52.889 --> 01:11:55.432
city services,
stuff like that.


913
01:11:55.600 --> 01:11:56.934
Oh, yeah.

914
01:11:57.018 --> 01:11:58.519
They cut all those.

915
01:12:03.692 --> 01:12:05.693
All right, here it is.
Fleck.


916
01:12:05.860 --> 01:12:07.778
Penny Fleck. Let's see.

917
01:12:08.697 --> 01:12:12.283
Diagnosed by
Dr. Benjamin Stoner.


918
01:12:13.827 --> 01:12:17.871
Oh. "The patient suffers
from delusional psychosis


919
01:12:18.039 --> 01:12:21.500
and narcissistic
personality disorder. "


920
01:12:22.085 --> 01:12:23.794
"Was found guilty
of endangering


921
01:12:23.878 --> 01:12:27.298
the welfare
of her own child. "


922
01:12:35.599 --> 01:12:36.599
What?

923
01:12:40.020 --> 01:12:41.478
You said she's your mother.

924
01:12:47.777 --> 01:12:50.154
I'm sorry, man. Like I said,
I can't release these records,


925
01:12:50.322 --> 01:12:53.073
you know,
without proper forms.


926
01:12:53.533 --> 01:12:55.200
I could get in trouble.

927
01:12:55.994 --> 01:12:58.037
Look, if you want to bring
your mom in here to sign,


928
01:12:58.204 --> 01:12:59.204
that'll be much easier,

929
01:12:59.372 --> 01:13:02.416
but I can't let this go
without her signature, okay?


930
01:13:02.584 --> 01:13:03.584
I'm sorry.

931
01:13:07.756 --> 01:13:09.965
No, man! Shit!

932
01:13:10.550 --> 01:13:12.426
Come on, man. Give it...

933
01:13:13.345 --> 01:13:15.638
Hey! Hey!

934
01:14:13.822 --> 01:14:16.740
<i>We went over this,
Penny. You adopted him.</i>


935
01:14:17.450 --> 01:14:19.243
<i>We have all the paperwork
right here.</i>


936
01:14:19.953 --> 01:14:22.162
That's not true.

937
01:14:22.330 --> 01:14:24.581
Thomas had that all made up,

938
01:14:24.749 --> 01:14:27.376
so it stayed our secret.

939
01:14:29.295 --> 01:14:31.714
You also stood by

940
01:14:32.340 --> 01:14:33.674
while one of your boyfriends

941
01:14:33.758 --> 01:14:37.219
repeatedly abused
your adopted son


942
01:14:38.596 --> 01:14:39.596
and battered you.

943
01:14:59.367 --> 01:15:00.951
Penny,

944
01:15:01.536 --> 01:15:05.164
your son was found tied
to a radiator


945
01:15:05.331 --> 01:15:07.750
in your filthy apartment.

946
01:15:07.917 --> 01:15:10.419
Malnourished with multiple
bruises across his body


947
01:15:10.587 --> 01:15:12.588
and severe trauma to his head.

948
01:15:14.758 --> 01:15:16.467
I never heard him cry.

949
01:15:17.385 --> 01:15:20.846
He's always been
such a happy little boy.


950
01:17:21.926 --> 01:17:23.343
It's time for bed.

951
01:17:26.848 --> 01:17:27.848
Oh, my God!

952
01:17:28.808 --> 01:17:30.559
What are you doing in here?

953
01:17:33.021 --> 01:17:34.897
You're in the wrong apartment.

954
01:17:41.529 --> 01:17:43.238
Your name's Arthur, right?

955
01:17:43.865 --> 01:17:45.073
You live down the hall.

956
01:17:48.286 --> 01:17:50.078
I really need you to leave.

957
01:17:54.375 --> 01:17:57.336
My little girl is sleeping
in the other room.


958
01:18:02.467 --> 01:18:03.550
Please.

959
01:18:06.220 --> 01:18:08.472
I had a bad day.

960
01:18:11.309 --> 01:18:13.810
Can I call someone?
Is your mother home?


961
01:19:40.064 --> 01:19:41.773
Shut up!

962
01:20:00.960 --> 01:20:02.377
Hey, Penny.

963
01:20:04.839 --> 01:20:06.173
Penny Fleck.

964
01:20:14.348 --> 01:20:16.183
I always hated that name.

965
01:20:19.812 --> 01:20:21.730
You know
how you used to tell me


966
01:20:23.775 --> 01:20:26.401
that my laugh was a condition?

967
01:20:27.945 --> 01:20:30.030
That there was
something wrong with me?


968
01:20:33.117 --> 01:20:34.326
There isn't.

969
01:20:37.205 --> 01:20:38.538
That's the real me.

970
01:20:39.373 --> 01:20:40.874
Happy.

971
01:20:43.086 --> 01:20:45.545
Happy.

972
01:20:48.883 --> 01:20:51.676
I haven't been happy

973
01:20:51.761 --> 01:20:54.012
one minute of
my entire fucking life.


974
01:21:00.978 --> 01:21:02.395
You know what's funny?

975
01:21:05.149 --> 01:21:06.942
You know
what really makes me laugh?


976
01:21:09.320 --> 01:21:11.738
I used to think
that my life was a tragedy...


977
01:21:13.491 --> 01:21:15.492
...but now I realize

978
01:21:15.660 --> 01:21:17.244
it's a fucking comedy.

979
01:22:27.773 --> 01:22:28.940
A very fine actor.

980
01:22:29.108 --> 01:22:32.110
<i>He's got a new movie
called American Playboy</i>


981
01:22:32.278 --> 01:22:34.154
<i>opening this week
across the country.</i>


982
01:22:34.322 --> 01:22:36.156
<i>Will you please welcome
a good friend</i>


983
01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:38.325
<i>of the show, Mr. 
Ethan Chase.</i>

984
01:22:58.012 --> 01:22:59.721
<i>Good to see you, Ethan.
You're looking great, Ethan.</i>


985
01:22:59.889 --> 01:23:01.681
<i>Thank you very much.
You're looking good yourself.</i>


986
01:23:01.849 --> 01:23:02.891
<i>Ah, can't complain.</i>

987
01:23:03.351 --> 01:23:05.644
Hey, Murray.
Thanks so much for having...


988
01:23:06.979 --> 01:23:08.021
Hey, Murray.

989
01:23:08.189 --> 01:23:10.190
Thank you so much for
having me on the show.


990
01:23:10.775 --> 01:23:12.901
It's been
a lifelong dream of mine.


991
01:23:15.196 --> 01:23:16.363
<i>I'm nervous right now.</i>

992
01:23:18.199 --> 01:23:19.491
- You are?
- I am nervous.


993
01:23:20.451 --> 01:23:21.993
Hey, Murray. I've been on...

994
01:23:35.424 --> 01:23:36.883
I'm sorry. What's that?

995
01:23:38.261 --> 01:23:40.053
Oh, that's very funny, Murray.

996
01:23:41.347 --> 01:23:43.515
You know, I'm also a comedian.

997
01:23:43.683 --> 01:23:44.975
Would you like to hear a joke?

998
01:23:46.185 --> 01:23:48.395
Yeah? All of you?

999
01:23:48.896 --> 01:23:49.896
Okay.

1000
01:23:52.942 --> 01:23:54.025
Knock...

1001
01:23:54.110 --> 01:23:55.235
Knock, knock.

1002
01:24:09.125 --> 01:24:10.417
Knock, knock.

1003
01:24:31.355 --> 01:24:32.522
That's life

1004
01:24:32.606 --> 01:24:34.316
That's life

1005
01:24:34.400 --> 01:24:37.319
<i>That's what all the people say</i>

1006
01:24:38.738 --> 01:24:41.614
<i>You're riding high in April</i>

1007
01:24:41.699 --> 01:24:44.367
<i>Shot down in May</i>

1008
01:24:44.452 --> 01:24:49.122
<i>But I know I'm gonna change that tune</i>

1009
01:24:50.666 --> 01:24:55.295
<i>When I'm back on top
Back on top in June</i>


1010
01:24:55.880 --> 01:24:58.298
<i>I said, that's life</i>

1011
01:24:58.382 --> 01:25:00.425
That's life

1012
01:25:00.509 --> 01:25:03.720
<i>And as funny as it may seem</i>

1013
01:25:04.430 --> 01:25:06.765
<i>Some people get their kicks</i>

1014
01:25:07.475 --> 01:25:10.143
<i>Stompin' on a dream</i>

1015
01:25:10.895 --> 01:25:14.647
<i>But I don't let it,
let it get me down</i>


1016
01:25:16.442 --> 01:25:18.777
<i>'Cause this fine old world</i>

1017
01:25:18.861 --> 01:25:21.363
<i>It keeps spinnin' around</i>

1018
01:25:22.198 --> 01:25:25.450
<i>I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate</i>

1019
01:25:25.534 --> 01:25:29.037
<i>A poet, a pawn and a king</i>

1020
01:25:29.121 --> 01:25:33.166
<i>I've been up and
down and over and out</i>

1021
01:25:33.250 --> 01:25:35.377
<i>And I know one thing</i>

1022
01:25:35.461 --> 01:25:41.091
<i>Each time I find
myself flat on my face</i>

1023
01:25:42.093 --> 01:25:48.264
<i>I pick myself up
And get back in the race</i>


1024
01:25:48.349 --> 01:25:49.474
<i>That's life</i>

1025
01:25:49.558 --> 01:25:51.226
That's life

1026
01:25:51.310 --> 01:25:54.187
<i>I tell ya, I can't deny it</i>

1027
01:25:55.773 --> 01:25:57.649
<i>I thought of quitting, baby</i>

1028
01:25:58.901 --> 01:26:01.444
<i>But my heart just ain't gonna buy it</i>

1029
01:26:01.529 --> 01:26:04.989
<i>And if I didn't think
It was worth one single try</i>


1030
01:26:07.743 --> 01:26:08.827
Coming.

1031
01:26:08.911 --> 01:26:12.455
<i>I'd jump right on a big bird
And then I'd fly...</i>


1032
01:26:19.922 --> 01:26:21.339
Hey, Arthur.

1033
01:26:21.507 --> 01:26:22.507
How's it going?

1034
01:26:23.509 --> 01:26:24.801
Oh, hey, guys.

1035
01:26:25.344 --> 01:26:26.469
Come on in.

1036
01:26:26.929 --> 01:26:28.054
Did you get a new gig?

1037
01:26:28.764 --> 01:26:29.764
No.

1038
01:26:30.683 --> 01:26:33.726
Oh, you must be going down to
that rally at City Hall.


1039
01:26:33.894 --> 01:26:35.562
I hear it's gonna be nuts.

1040
01:26:35.729 --> 01:26:37.313
Oh, is that today?

1041
01:26:38.023 --> 01:26:39.023
Yeah.

1042
01:26:39.942 --> 01:26:41.359
What's with the makeup then?

1043
01:26:42.820 --> 01:26:44.320
My mom died.

1044
01:26:44.488 --> 01:26:45.697
I'm celebrating.

1045
01:26:46.615 --> 01:26:47.615
Right. We heard.

1046
01:26:47.783 --> 01:26:48.825
That's why we came by.

1047
01:26:48.993 --> 01:26:51.703
We figured, you know, you
could use some cheering up.


1048
01:26:52.246 --> 01:26:53.872
Aw, that's sweet.

1049
01:26:54.039 --> 01:26:56.916
But, no, I feel good.

1050
01:26:57.710 --> 01:26:59.335
Yeah, I stopped
taking my medication.


1051
01:26:59.503 --> 01:27:01.129
I feel a lot better now.

1052
01:27:03.257 --> 01:27:05.758
Oh, okay. Good for you.

1053
01:27:07.887 --> 01:27:10.763
So, hey, listen,
I don't know if you heard,


1054
01:27:10.931 --> 01:27:13.349
but the cops have been coming
around the shop,


1055
01:27:14.101 --> 01:27:18.021
talking to all the guys
about those subway murders.


1056
01:27:18.147 --> 01:27:19.939
- And,...
- They didn't talk to me.


1057
01:27:21.901 --> 01:27:24.569
That's because the suspect
was a regular-sized person.


1058
01:27:25.112 --> 01:27:27.614
If it was a fucking midget,
you'd be in jail right now.


1059
01:27:33.412 --> 01:27:34.662
Anyway,

1060
01:27:34.830 --> 01:27:38.833
Hoyt said
that they talked to you,


1061
01:27:39.001 --> 01:27:40.293
and now
they're looking for me,


1062
01:27:40.377 --> 01:27:41.961
and I just wanna know
what you said.


1063
01:27:42.129 --> 01:27:43.546
Make sure our stories line up.

1064
01:27:43.714 --> 01:27:46.758
- Seeing as how you're my boy.
- Yeah, that's important.


1065
01:27:46.926 --> 01:27:48.635
- That makes a lot of sense.
- You know what I mean?


1066
01:27:48.761 --> 01:27:50.428
Thank you, Randall.
Thank you so much.


1067
01:27:56.227 --> 01:27:57.227
Arthur!

1068
01:27:57.895 --> 01:27:59.229
No!

1069
01:28:00.564 --> 01:28:01.564
What?

1070
01:28:02.900 --> 01:28:03.900
No!

1071
01:28:11.825 --> 01:28:13.910
Why would you do that, Arthur?

1072
01:28:34.974 --> 01:28:37.141
Do you watch
The Murray Franklin Show?


1073
01:28:37.226 --> 01:28:38.643
Yeah.

1074
01:28:39.979 --> 01:28:41.771
I'm gonna be on tonight.

1075
01:28:46.068 --> 01:28:47.819
It fucking crazy, innit?

1076
01:28:47.903 --> 01:28:49.737
Me on the telly.

1077
01:28:51.782 --> 01:28:53.741
What the fuck, Arthur?

1078
01:28:54.994 --> 01:28:56.077
What?

1079
01:29:01.083 --> 01:29:02.292
It's okay, Gary.

1080
01:29:02.751 --> 01:29:03.751
You can go.

1081
01:29:06.338 --> 01:29:07.964
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1082
01:29:10.926 --> 01:29:12.385
Oh!

1083
01:29:12.636 --> 01:29:14.721
Don't look. Just go.

1084
01:29:27.276 --> 01:29:28.276
Fuck.

1085
01:29:33.574 --> 01:29:34.741
Hey, Arthur?

1086
01:29:34.908 --> 01:29:35.908
Yeah?

1087
01:29:37.119 --> 01:29:39.537
Arthur, can you get the lock?

1088
01:29:42.750 --> 01:29:43.750
Shit.

1089
01:29:44.209 --> 01:29:45.668
Sorry, Gary.

1090
01:29:56.639 --> 01:29:57.680
Gary?

1091
01:29:57.848 --> 01:29:58.848
Yeah.

1092
01:30:01.393 --> 01:30:03.978
You were the only one
that was ever nice to me.


1093
01:30:06.065 --> 01:30:07.273
Skedaddle.

1094
01:31:34.486 --> 01:31:35.820
Hey, Arthur!

1095
01:31:35.988 --> 01:31:37.363
We need to talk.

1096
01:31:37.614 --> 01:31:38.740
Oh!

1097
01:31:38.824 --> 01:31:40.825
Hey! Stop, Arthur!

1098
01:31:46.248 --> 01:31:47.331
Arthur!

1099
01:31:49.918 --> 01:31:51.544
Watch it!
Out of the way!


1100
01:31:54.715 --> 01:31:55.715
Move!

1101
01:31:57.718 --> 01:31:58.718
Arthur!

1102
01:31:59.762 --> 01:32:01.012
Shit.

1103
01:32:03.390 --> 01:32:04.474
Hey! Hey!

1104
01:32:11.523 --> 01:32:12.523
Arthur, stop!

1105
01:32:18.238 --> 01:32:19.238
Go! Go!

1106
01:32:21.366 --> 01:32:23.242
<i>Now

<i>Stand clear of

1108
01:32:36.381 --> 01:32:39.008
Hold that train! Hold it!

1109
01:32:40.928 --> 01:32:42.136
Get out! Get outta here!

1110
01:32:43.263 --> 01:32:44.806
<i>Next stop, Bedford Park.</i>

1111
01:32:59.279 --> 01:33:00.279
Masks off!

1112
01:33:00.447 --> 01:33:01.823
Get your mask off!

1113
01:33:02.658 --> 01:33:04.408
Signs down! Now!

1114
01:33:13.585 --> 01:33:15.044
Police! Signs down!

1115

Signs down.

1116
01:33:22.010 --> 01:33:23.177
What the fuck!

1117
01:33:26.098 --> 01:33:27.306
Beat his ass!

1118
01:33:34.022 --> 01:33:35.565
Stop fighting! Police!

1119
01:33:35.732 --> 01:33:37.859
Police! Get down!

1120
01:33:40.028 --> 01:33:42.154
Get down! Get the fuck back!

1121
01:33:43.240 --> 01:33:44.240
Police! Get down.

1122
01:33:45.158 --> 01:33:46.284
Get the fuck down!

1123
01:33:50.998 --> 01:33:53.416
Stay the fuck back! Down!

1124
01:33:57.045 --> 01:33:58.045
What the...

1125
01:34:01.425 --> 01:34:02.425
Arthur!

1126
01:34:03.010 --> 01:34:04.051
Burke!

1127
01:34:05.679 --> 01:34:07.138
Don't do it!

1128
01:34:56.980 --> 01:34:58.147
<i>Two officers on the train</i>

1129
01:34:58.231 --> 01:34:59.649
<i>were violently confronted
by the crowd,</i>


1130
01:34:59.816 --> 01:35:01.233
<i>and tonight are in serious</i>

1131
01:35:01.318 --> 01:35:03.527

1132
01:35:03.612 --> 01:35:05.196
<i>We're going live now to</i>

1133
01:35:05.280 --> 01:35:07.073
<i>co-anchor Courtney Weathers,</i>

1134
01:35:07.240 --> 01:35:09.158

the Bedford Park Station,</i>


1135
01:35:09.326 --> 01:35:11.160
<i>near where the shooting
took place.</i>


1136
01:35:11.328 --> 01:35:13.204
<i>Courtney,
what's the scene there?</i>


1137
01:35:18.210 --> 01:35:19.251
Murray.

1138
01:35:19.419 --> 01:35:21.003
Hey, hey, hey.
It's Mr. Franklin, buddy.


1139
01:35:21.171 --> 01:35:23.547
Oh, come on, Gene.
That's all bullshit.


1140
01:35:24.633 --> 01:35:25.841
Thank you, Murray.

1141
01:35:27.052 --> 01:35:28.803
I feel like I know you.

1142
01:35:29.304 --> 01:35:31.138
I've been
watching you forever.


1143
01:35:31.306 --> 01:35:32.431
Thank you.

1144
01:35:32.599 --> 01:35:33.891
What's with the face?

1145
01:35:34.059 --> 01:35:36.018
I mean,
are you part of the protest?


1146
01:35:36.186 --> 01:35:37.186
No.

1147
01:35:37.354 --> 01:35:39.105
No, I don't believe
in any of that.


1148
01:35:39.815 --> 01:35:41.399
I don't believe in anything.

1149
01:35:42.025 --> 01:35:43.567
I just thought
it'd be good for my act.


1150
01:35:43.735 --> 01:35:45.236
For your act? Didn't you hear

1151
01:35:45.320 --> 01:35:46.654
what happened on the subway?
Some clown got killed.


1152
01:35:46.822 --> 01:35:48.364
He's aware of that.
He's aware of that. Yeah.


1153
01:35:48.532 --> 01:35:49.782
No, I hadn't heard.

1154
01:35:50.242 --> 01:35:51.325
- Yeah.
- You see?


1155
01:35:51.410 --> 01:35:52.743
This is what I'm telling you.
The audience is gonna go crazy


1156
01:35:52.828 --> 01:35:53.786
if you put this guy on.

1157
01:35:53.954 --> 01:35:56.080
Maybe for a bit,
but not a whole segment.


1158
01:35:56.248 --> 01:35:58.457
Gene, it's gonna work.
It's gonna work.


1159
01:35:59.251 --> 01:36:01.210
We're gonna go with it.

1160
01:36:01.586 --> 01:36:02.586
Thank you, Murray.

1161
01:36:03.171 --> 01:36:04.296
Couple rules, though.

1162
01:36:04.464 --> 01:36:06.215
No cursing.
No off-color material.


1163
01:36:06.383 --> 01:36:07.842
We do a clean show.

1164
01:36:08.010 --> 01:36:09.010
Okay?

1165
01:36:09.177 --> 01:36:10.761
You'll go on
right after Dr. Sally.


1166
01:36:10.929 --> 01:36:11.929
I love Dr. Sally.

1167
01:36:12.097 --> 01:36:13.514
Good, good. Someone will

1168
01:36:13.598 --> 01:36:15.766
- come and get you, okay?
- Okay. Perfect.


1169
01:36:15.851 --> 01:36:16.976
Good luck.

1170
01:36:17.060 --> 01:36:18.060
- Thanks, Murray.
- Okay.


1171
01:36:19.271 --> 01:36:22.481
- Murray, one small thing.
- Yeah.


1172
01:36:22.649 --> 01:36:24.316
When you bring me out,

1173
01:36:24.484 --> 01:36:26.360
can you introduce me as Joker?

1174
01:36:26.528 --> 01:36:28.237
What's wrong
with your real name?


1175
01:36:28.864 --> 01:36:31.115
That's what you called me
on the show.


1176
01:36:31.283 --> 01:36:32.408
A joker.

1177
01:36:32.576 --> 01:36:33.576
Do you remember?

1178
01:36:33.952 --> 01:36:35.953
- Did I?
- I don't know.


1179
01:36:36.121 --> 01:36:38.205
Well, if you say so, kid,
you know, Joker it is.


1180
01:36:38.373 --> 01:36:39.373
It's good.

1181
01:36:39.541 --> 01:36:40.624
Thanks, Murray.

1182
01:37:02.898 --> 01:37:03.939
I'll try it, you know,

1183
01:37:04.024 --> 01:37:05.900
but I'm not sure
my wife will let me do it.


1184
01:37:07.360 --> 01:37:08.694
Maybe my next wife.

1185
01:37:12.407 --> 01:37:14.158
You gotta see
our next guest for yourself.


1186
01:37:14.326 --> 01:37:16.368
I'm pretty sure
this guy could use a doctor.


1187
01:37:16.703 --> 01:37:17.703
Oh!

1188
01:37:17.788 --> 01:37:19.163
Does he have sexual problems?

1189
01:37:19.331 --> 01:37:21.749
Oh, he looks like
he's got a lot of problems.


1190
01:37:22.959 --> 01:37:25.586
All right, Bobby, let's show
that clip one last time.


1191
01:37:32.010 --> 01:37:34.887
<i>I hated school as a kid.</i>

1192
01:37:36.681 --> 01:37:38.849
<i>But my mother
would always say,</i>


1193
01:37:39.893 --> 01:37:41.143
<i>"You should enjoy it.</i>

1194
01:37:41.228 --> 01:37:44.355
<i>One day, you'll have to
work for a living. "</i>


1195
01:37:44.523 --> 01:37:45.689
<i>"No, I won't, Ma.</i>

1196
01:37:45.774 --> 01:37:47.733
<i>I'm gonna be a comedian. "</i>

1197
01:37:54.032 --> 01:37:56.325
Okay. You may...

1198
01:37:57.786 --> 01:38:01.038
You may have seen that clip
of our next guest.


1199
01:38:01.206 --> 01:38:03.582
Now, before he comes out,
I just want to say


1200
01:38:03.750 --> 01:38:05.251
that we're all heartbroken

1201
01:38:05.335 --> 01:38:07.294
about what's going on
in the city tonight.


1202
01:38:07.462 --> 01:38:09.755
But this is
how he wanted to come out,


1203
01:38:09.923 --> 01:38:13.134
and honestly, I think
we could all use a good laugh.


1204
01:38:13.301 --> 01:38:15.469
So, please welcome, Joker.

1205
01:38:58.096 --> 01:38:59.471
Are you all right, Doctor?

1206
01:39:03.310 --> 01:39:05.769
Well,
that was quite an entrance.


1207
01:39:12.319 --> 01:39:13.319
You okay?

1208
01:39:16.156 --> 01:39:17.573
Yeah.

1209
01:39:17.741 --> 01:39:20.451
This is exactly
how I imagined it.


1210
01:39:22.412 --> 01:39:24.205
Well, that makes one of us.

1211
01:39:31.087 --> 01:39:33.255
So, can you tell us
about this look?


1212
01:39:33.423 --> 01:39:34.757
When we spoke earlier,

1213
01:39:34.841 --> 01:39:36.800
you mentioned that this look
is not a political statement.


1214
01:39:36.968 --> 01:39:38.010
Is that right?

1215
01:39:38.178 --> 01:39:39.803
That's right, Murray.
I'm not political.


1216
01:39:39.971 --> 01:39:42.514
I'm just trying to
make people laugh.


1217
01:39:42.682 --> 01:39:44.683
And how's that going for you?

1218
01:39:52.776 --> 01:39:54.610
So, I know you're a comedian.

1219
01:39:54.778 --> 01:39:56.612
You been working on
any new material?


1220
01:39:56.696 --> 01:39:57.821
You wanna tell us a joke?

1221
01:40:03.536 --> 01:40:04.536
Yeah?

1222
01:40:06.706 --> 01:40:07.706
Okay.

1223
01:40:13.755 --> 01:40:15.381
He's got a book.

1224
01:40:16.299 --> 01:40:17.758
A book of jokes.

1225
01:40:27.602 --> 01:40:28.978
Take your time.
We got all night.


1226
01:40:35.026 --> 01:40:37.319
Okay, okay. Here's one.

1227
01:40:40.448 --> 01:40:42.950
Knock, knock.

1228
01:40:43.118 --> 01:40:44.451
And you had to look that up?

1229
01:40:51.584 --> 01:40:53.210
I want to get it right.

1230
01:40:55.046 --> 01:40:56.588
Knock, knock.

1231
01:40:56.756 --> 01:40:58.257
Who's there?

1232
01:40:59.718 --> 01:41:01.135
It's the police, ma'am.

1233
01:41:01.303 --> 01:41:03.137
Your son's been hit
by a drunk driver.


1234
01:41:03.305 --> 01:41:05.723
He's dead.

1235
01:41:07.642 --> 01:41:09.226
Oh, no, no, no.

1236
01:41:09.394 --> 01:41:11.145
No, you cannot
joke about that.


1237
01:41:11.313 --> 01:41:13.272
Yeah, that's not funny,
Arthur.


1238
01:41:13.440 --> 01:41:15.899
That's not the kind of humor
we do on this show.


1239
01:41:16.484 --> 01:41:18.777
Okay. I'm... Yeah, I'm sorry.

1240
01:41:18.945 --> 01:41:23.324
It's just, you know, it's been
a rough few weeks, Murray.


1241
01:41:24.909 --> 01:41:26.744
Ever since

1242
01:41:29.289 --> 01:41:31.415
I killed
those three Wall Street guys.


1243
01:41:38.006 --> 01:41:39.965
Okay, I'm waiting
for the punchline.


1244
01:41:41.468 --> 01:41:43.177
There is no punchline.

1245
01:41:44.596 --> 01:41:46.472
It's not a joke.

1246
01:41:51.144 --> 01:41:52.227
You're serious, aren't you?

1247
01:41:52.395 --> 01:41:53.395
You're telling us you killed

1248
01:41:53.480 --> 01:41:54.605
those three young men
on the subway?


1249
01:41:55.940 --> 01:41:57.649
And why should we believe you?

1250
01:41:57.817 --> 01:41:59.777
I got nothing left to lose.

1251
01:42:01.780 --> 01:42:03.822
Nothing can hurt me anymore.

1252
01:42:06.993 --> 01:42:09.870
My life is
nothing but a comedy.


1253
01:42:13.500 --> 01:42:14.541
Well,
let me get this straight,


1254
01:42:14.626 --> 01:42:16.877
you think that killing
those guys is funny?


1255
01:42:17.545 --> 01:42:19.046
I do.

1256
01:42:19.214 --> 01:42:21.840
And I'm tired
of pretending it's not.


1257
01:42:22.008 --> 01:42:23.884
Comedy is subjective, Murray.

1258
01:42:24.344 --> 01:42:26.053
Isn't that what they say?

1259
01:42:26.221 --> 01:42:27.971
All of you,

1260
01:42:28.139 --> 01:42:30.724
the system that knows so much,

1261
01:42:30.892 --> 01:42:33.602
you decide
what's right or wrong.


1262
01:42:33.770 --> 01:42:38.982
The same way that you decide
what's funny or not!


1263
01:42:40.318 --> 01:42:41.318
Get him off!

1264
01:42:42.070 --> 01:42:45.739
Well, okay,
I think I might understand


1265
01:42:46.074 --> 01:42:47.574
that you did this to
start a movement,


1266
01:42:47.659 --> 01:42:49.660
to become a symbol?

1267
01:42:50.286 --> 01:42:51.829
Come on, Murray.

1268
01:42:51.996 --> 01:42:53.163
Do I look like
the kind of clown


1269
01:42:53.248 --> 01:42:54.832
that could start a movement?

1270
01:42:54.999 --> 01:42:57.835
I killed those guys
because they were awful.


1271
01:42:58.002 --> 01:43:00.504
Everybody is awful these days.

1272
01:43:00.672 --> 01:43:02.965
It's enough to
make anyone crazy.


1273
01:43:03.133 --> 01:43:04.883
Okay. So, that's it,
you're crazy.


1274
01:43:05.051 --> 01:43:07.344
That's your defense
for killing three young men?


1275
01:43:07.971 --> 01:43:09.513
No.

1276
01:43:09.681 --> 01:43:13.016
They couldn't carry a tune
to save their lives.


1277
01:43:14.853 --> 01:43:18.272
Oh, why is everybody
so upset about these guys?


1278
01:43:19.149 --> 01:43:20.899
If it was me
dying on the sidewalk,


1279
01:43:20.984 --> 01:43:22.359
you'd walk right over me!

1280
01:43:22.527 --> 01:43:24.653
I pass you every day,
and you don't notice me.


1281
01:43:24.821 --> 01:43:27.072
But these guys, what,
because Thomas Wayne


1282
01:43:27.157 --> 01:43:28.699
went and cried about them
on TV?


1283
01:43:28.867 --> 01:43:30.909
You have a problem
with Thomas Wayne, too?


1284
01:43:31.077 --> 01:43:32.995
Yes, I do.

1285
01:43:33.163 --> 01:43:36.582
Have you seen what it's like
out there, Murray?


1286
01:43:36.749 --> 01:43:39.793
Do you ever actually
leave the studio?


1287
01:43:39.961 --> 01:43:43.797
Everybody just yells
and screams at each other.


1288
01:43:43.965 --> 01:43:46.133
Nobody's civil anymore.

1289
01:43:46.301 --> 01:43:49.887
Nobody thinks what it's like
to be the other guy.


1290
01:43:50.680 --> 01:43:53.474
You think men like
Thomas Wayne ever think


1291
01:43:53.558 --> 01:43:55.517
what it's like to be
someone like me?


1292
01:43:55.685 --> 01:43:58.395
To be somebody but themselves?
They don't.


1293
01:43:58.605 --> 01:44:00.731
They think that
we'll just sit there


1294
01:44:00.815 --> 01:44:03.192
and take it,
like good little boys!


1295
01:44:03.485 --> 01:44:05.569
That we won't werewolf
and go wild!


1296
01:44:05.737 --> 01:44:07.362
You finished?

1297
01:44:07.530 --> 01:44:09.865
I mean, it's so much
self-pity, Arthur.


1298
01:44:10.033 --> 01:44:11.575
You sound like
you're making excuses


1299
01:44:11.659 --> 01:44:13.076
for killing those young men.

1300
01:44:13.244 --> 01:44:15.078
Not everybody,
and I'll tell you this,


1301
01:44:15.163 --> 01:44:16.580
not everyone is awful.

1302
01:44:18.875 --> 01:44:20.083
You're awful, Murray.

1303
01:44:20.251 --> 01:44:22.127
Me? I'm awful?

1304
01:44:22.295 --> 01:44:24.046
Oh, yeah, how am I awful?

1305
01:44:26.216 --> 01:44:27.674
Playing my video.

1306
01:44:29.093 --> 01:44:30.969
Inviting me on this show.

1307
01:44:32.055 --> 01:44:34.389
You just wanted to
make fun of me.


1308
01:44:35.391 --> 01:44:37.351
You're just like
the rest of them.


1309
01:44:37.519 --> 01:44:39.436
You don't know
the first thing about me, pal.


1310
01:44:39.604 --> 01:44:42.189
Look what happened, because of
what you did. What it led to.


1311
01:44:42.357 --> 01:44:44.066
There are riots out there.

1312
01:44:44.234 --> 01:44:45.692
Two policemen are
in critical condition,


1313
01:44:45.777 --> 01:44:46.902
and you're laughing.

1314
01:44:47.070 --> 01:44:48.070
You're laughing.

1315
01:44:48.238 --> 01:44:51.073
Someone was killed today,
because of what you did.


1316
01:44:51.241 --> 01:44:52.699
I know.

1317
01:44:55.286 --> 01:44:56.495
How about another joke,
Murray?


1318
01:44:56.663 --> 01:44:58.288
No, I think we've had
enough of your jokes.


1319
01:44:58.456 --> 01:44:59.665
- What do you get...
- I don't think so.


1320
01:44:59.832 --> 01:45:02.376
...when you cross
a mentally-ill loner


1321
01:45:02.544 --> 01:45:04.962
with a society
that abandons him


1322
01:45:05.046 --> 01:45:06.088
and treats him like trash?

1323
01:45:06.256 --> 01:45:07.256
Call the police, Gene!

1324
01:45:07.423 --> 01:45:08.715
- I'll tell you what you get!
- Call the police.


1325
01:45:08.883 --> 01:45:10.551
You get
what you fucking deserve!


1326
