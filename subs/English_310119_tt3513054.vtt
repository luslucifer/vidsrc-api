2
00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.386
<i>Father...</i>

3
00:02:11.474 --> 00:02:13.756
<i>where are you?</i>

4
00:05:35.711 --> 00:05:37.580
<i>Father...</i>

5
00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:40.163
<i>speak to me.</i>

6
00:09:56.906 --> 00:09:58.975
I have water for you here, Yeshua.

7
00:10:00.609 --> 00:10:03.459
That's what your mother
calls you, isn't it?


8
00:10:05.581 --> 00:10:08.565
Any name that's good enough for Mary
is good enough for me.


9
00:10:15.324 --> 00:10:17.974
And what does your father call you?

10
00:10:53.662 --> 00:10:55.511
Yeshua.

11
00:12:03.698 --> 00:12:05.514
Hello?

12
00:12:45.925 --> 00:12:49.041
I'm looking for water. 
I can work for it.

13
00:12:51.413 --> 00:12:53.049
- What can you do?
- Whatever's needed.


14
00:12:53.149 --> 00:12:56.865
You're building up here.
I know carpentry and stone.


15
00:13:06.361 --> 00:13:10.679
- Where are you headed?
- Jerusalem, but I'm a little lost.


16
00:13:17.606 --> 00:13:19.809
Where are you coming from?

17
00:13:19.909 --> 00:13:22.311
From spending time in the desert.

18
00:13:22.411 --> 00:13:25.210
Why? There's nothing here.

19
00:13:30.185 --> 00:13:32.517
What is Jerusalem like?

20
00:13:34.856 --> 00:13:37.447
Dirty and corrupt.

21
00:13:38.293 --> 00:13:41.994
But also alive. Very alive.

22
00:13:43.832 --> 00:13:47.303
- Do you have a father?
- Yes. He's out.


23
00:13:47.403 --> 00:13:50.907
- He'll ask me if I offered you food.
- That's not necessary.


24
00:13:52.007 --> 00:13:53.959
Thank you.

25
00:13:54.059 --> 00:13:57.793
Stay. Please. Rest for a while.

26
00:14:16.832 --> 00:14:20.594
Talking to your father
is like talking to a rock.


27
00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:26.343
He's so busy with his little things,
the shape of a drop of dew,


28
00:14:26.443 --> 00:14:30.447
the sound roots make breaking
their way through the ground.


29
00:14:30.547 --> 00:14:33.515
Everything matters more to him than you.

30
00:14:33.615 --> 00:14:35.517
No.

31
00:14:35.617 --> 00:14:37.983
My father loves me.

32
00:14:39.788 --> 00:14:42.457
He is amused by you.

33
00:14:42.557 --> 00:14:45.023
He loves himself only.

34
00:14:49.898 --> 00:14:51.900
Are you lost?

35
00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.265
No.

36
00:14:54.970 --> 00:14:57.474
Are you one of those preachers?

37
00:14:57.574 --> 00:15:02.221
Looking for something here in the desert
that you can't find anywhere else?


38
00:15:05.014 --> 00:15:08.738
How long have you
been out here, holy man?

39
00:15:09.451 --> 00:15:12.522
Since the last full moon.
Maybe a little longer.


40
00:15:12.622 --> 00:15:14.057
Alone?

41
00:15:14.157 --> 00:15:17.823
No. You people are never alone.

42
00:15:18.394 --> 00:15:22.617
Some spirit or something
is always with you, isn't it?


43
00:15:24.399 --> 00:15:28.938
Tell me one thing you've learned out here,
and I'll offer you shelter for the night.


44
00:15:29.038 --> 00:15:33.439
- Oh, that's not necessary.
- Please. It would give me pleasure.


45
00:15:35.977 --> 00:15:38.880
Man makes do anywhere.

46
00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:41.723
Because he is man.

47
00:15:42.818 --> 00:15:44.683
Good.

48
00:15:45.337 --> 00:15:47.244
Give me a hand with this.

49
00:15:59.801 --> 00:16:01.666
Thank you.

50
00:16:46.748 --> 00:16:51.702
- There's no need to wait for her.
- I don't mean to offend, but I'm fasting.


51
00:16:58.393 --> 00:17:00.664
What is it?

52
00:17:00.764 --> 00:17:04.865
She thinks it's funny
that she wants to eat but can't...


53
00:17:04.965 --> 00:17:08.328
and our guest, who can, won't.

54
00:17:50.078 --> 00:17:52.543
What are you building up there?

55
00:17:52.914 --> 00:17:55.880
A house for me to live in.

56
00:17:56.652 --> 00:18:01.324
My father wants me to stay here.
To help him make something of this place.


57
00:18:01.724 --> 00:18:04.122
Is that what you want?

58
00:18:06.695 --> 00:18:09.294
What is it that you want?

59
00:18:14.069 --> 00:18:16.735
I want to go to Jerusalem.

60
00:18:17.038 --> 00:18:19.109
And I want to see the sea.

61
00:18:19.209 --> 00:18:22.278
And I want to see
the lighthouse at Alexandria.


62
00:18:22.378 --> 00:18:25.076
And does your father know that?

63
00:18:25.947 --> 00:18:27.583
No.

64
00:18:27.683 --> 00:18:30.548
Why don't you talk to him about it?

65
00:18:39.127 --> 00:18:40.927
I've seen Jerusalem.

66
00:18:41.027 --> 00:18:44.362
<i>I've walked away without my father
knowing and I've seen it from a ridge.</i>


67
00:18:46.034 --> 00:18:50.087
<i>It shines in the sun and I want it
so much, I could scream.</i>


68
00:18:55.844 --> 00:18:58.547
I don't want to waste my time here.

69
00:18:58.647 --> 00:19:01.112
Wasting life is a sin.

70
00:19:02.117 --> 00:19:05.049
I want to leave
my footprint on the world.

71
00:19:09.274 --> 00:19:11.806
Come, holy man.

72
00:19:16.498 --> 00:19:18.834
Oh, this isn't necessary.
I can sleep outside.


73
00:19:18.934 --> 00:19:21.532
No. She won't bother you.

74
00:20:17.192 --> 00:20:19.090
Rabbi?

75
00:20:20.228 --> 00:20:22.060
Rabbi.

76
00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:29.133
I've committed a horrible sin.

77
00:20:30.405 --> 00:20:34.062
My son is not my husband's son.

78
00:20:34.676 --> 00:20:37.408
I don't want to die...

79
00:20:37.913 --> 00:20:41.245
and leave this lie behind me.

80
00:20:44.653 --> 00:20:48.510
I don't want my son trapped here forever.

81
00:20:50.091 --> 00:20:53.033
Help me, please.

82
00:23:10.065 --> 00:23:13.636
In your holy man comings-and-goings...

83
00:23:13.736 --> 00:23:16.501
have you learned any medicine?

84
00:23:20.375 --> 00:23:23.244
Cures are the only things worth seeking.

85
00:23:23.344 --> 00:23:27.379
For pain... suffering.

86
00:23:28.183 --> 00:23:31.516
The rest is just...

87
00:23:34.422 --> 00:23:37.725
This boy is good
at taking care of the sick.


88
00:23:38.159 --> 00:23:41.225
He's had practice, unfortunately.

89
00:23:42.063 --> 00:23:46.864
If he had come into this world somewhere
else, he could have made it his life's work.


90
00:23:47.903 --> 00:23:50.968
And what did you want for yourself
when you were a boy?


91
00:23:51.673 --> 00:23:54.677
I wanted to raise livestock...

92
00:23:54.877 --> 00:23:58.326
and be a butcher, like my father.

93
00:23:58.847 --> 00:24:01.719
He never taught me any of it, though.

94
00:24:01.883 --> 00:24:07.122
He said it had
taken him years and years

95
00:24:07.222 --> 00:24:12.056
to master the skill on his own,
and he wasn't just going to give it away.


96
00:24:13.361 --> 00:24:17.632
"Every man must make himself."
I heard that a thousand times.


97
00:24:17.732 --> 00:24:20.164
He was a selfish man.

98
00:24:21.769 --> 00:24:24.268
And he died alone.

99
00:24:26.007 --> 00:24:28.144
What does your father do?

100
00:24:28.244 --> 00:24:31.180
Ask for permission
when you address a guest, boy.


101
00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:34.545
That's all right. 
We spoke some yesterday.

102
00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:38.186
My father's a carpenter.

103
00:24:38.686 --> 00:24:40.490
Smart man.

104
00:24:40.890 --> 00:24:44.955
A man who is good at work like that
can always provide for his children.


105
00:24:47.763 --> 00:24:52.038
And did you want to be a carpenter also
when you were a boy?


106
00:25:07.282 --> 00:25:10.592
Your good intentions will be wasted here.

107
00:25:11.287 --> 00:25:15.553
They don't need us to ruin their lives.
They'll do that all by themselves.


108
00:25:16.191 --> 00:25:18.508
Do you know what I do
when they're finally mine?


109
00:25:18.608 --> 00:25:23.527
I have them watch the life they've lived
over and over again. Forever.


110
00:25:24.665 --> 00:25:27.135
Oh, what anger.

111
00:25:27.235 --> 00:25:29.800
You are your father's son.

112
00:25:31.439 --> 00:25:34.408
Very well. I'll stay out of it.
Surprise me.


113
00:25:34.508 --> 00:25:38.176
- And if I do?
- A wager?


114
00:25:40.415 --> 00:25:43.369
If you can solve
this entanglement, this knot...


115
00:25:43.469 --> 00:25:47.734
to the satisfaction of the mother,
the father and the child,


116
00:25:47.834 --> 00:25:51.299
I'll stay out of your way
for the rest of your journey home.


117
00:25:56.230 --> 00:25:58.400
And if I fail?

118
00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:01.165
Failure is its own punishment.

119
00:26:02.537 --> 00:26:06.571
- That's Daddy talk.
- Enough for the day.


120
00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:15.651
This is all just an excuse
to delay your departure, isn't it?


121
00:26:15.751 --> 00:26:19.120
Because you're scared to go on.
Scared out of your head.


122
00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:21.673
You're not ready and you know it.

123
00:27:51.879 --> 00:27:53.711
Here.

124
00:28:51.005 --> 00:28:53.504
What part of a bird doesn't fly?

125
00:28:54.475 --> 00:28:57.996
It's a riddle.
What part of a bird doesn't fly?


126
00:29:00.481 --> 00:29:02.416
I don't know.

127
00:29:02.516 --> 00:29:04.548
Its shadow.

128
00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:08.257
- Did you make that up?
- Yes.


129
00:29:08.357 --> 00:29:10.488
It's good.

130
00:29:14.845 --> 00:29:16.444
Yes.

131
00:29:28.376 --> 00:29:31.409
I want the boy to learn a trade.

132
00:29:33.581 --> 00:29:36.480
There's plenty for him
to learn right here.


133
00:29:38.619 --> 00:29:41.489
Any trade that he wants.

134
00:29:41.889 --> 00:29:44.622
Or that you want for him.

135
00:29:45.326 --> 00:29:48.392
In Jerusalem, perhaps.

136
00:29:54.535 --> 00:29:56.605
I want this very much.

137
00:29:56.705 --> 00:30:01.010
I would need money for that.
Just to get him set up and started.


138
00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:04.912
No one will take him
as an apprentice without payment.


139
00:30:05.012 --> 00:30:08.045
For food, at least.

140
00:30:09.149 --> 00:30:10.952
Impossible.

141
00:30:12.052 --> 00:30:14.255
You are...

142
00:30:15.155 --> 00:30:17.592
a powerful...

143
00:30:17.992 --> 00:30:19.760
resourceful...

144
00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:22.497
beautiful man...

145
00:30:22.597 --> 00:30:25.329
and you will find a way.

146
00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:28.766
I know it.

147
00:30:37.745 --> 00:30:41.028
I cannot do my dying while he's here.

148
00:30:51.042 --> 00:30:55.076
My father was 47 when he had me.
My mother was 20.


149
00:30:56.330 --> 00:30:59.935
He had another wife before her,
but she died.


150
00:31:00.435 --> 00:31:03.247
And now my mother will die too.

151
00:31:04.338 --> 00:31:06.805
And my father says
a man makes his own luck.


152
00:31:07.875 --> 00:31:09.740
No.

153
00:31:10.811 --> 00:31:13.681
What did he do
to make two wives die?

154
00:31:14.481 --> 00:31:16.284
Nothing.

155
00:31:16.684 --> 00:31:18.916
I agree with you.

156
00:31:26.527 --> 00:31:29.593
Do you have a wife or children?

157
00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:34.832
Do you plan to?

158
00:31:37.238 --> 00:31:39.770
Well, you never know, right?

159
00:31:49.017 --> 00:31:52.187
- Have you ever sailed on a boat?
- Yes, I have.


160
00:31:52.287 --> 00:31:56.056
- Is it scary?
- It can be terrifying.


161
00:31:56.156 --> 00:31:58.639
But mostly it's thrilling.

162
00:32:07.501 --> 00:32:10.234
My father sailed on a boat once.

163
00:32:13.007 --> 00:32:15.973
He said he got caught
in a storm at sea.

164
00:32:16.344 --> 00:32:18.809
He said it was a nightmare.

165
00:32:20.815 --> 00:32:24.482
Everything outside of our world
is scary to him.


166
00:35:40.648 --> 00:35:44.414
My father says once my mother
is buried here that we cannot leave.


167
00:35:47.221 --> 00:35:50.520
He says a grave ties a man
to the land forever.


168
00:35:54.395 --> 00:35:57.556
Do you think I'm selfish
because I don't want to live here?


169
00:35:57.656 --> 00:35:59.138
No.

170
00:35:59.668 --> 00:36:02.532
My father has lived here his whole life...

171
00:36:02.970 --> 00:36:05.769
and he's lived it
the way he wanted to.

172
00:36:06.841 --> 00:36:09.773
But now it's my turn. 
Men take turns.

173
00:36:14.281 --> 00:36:16.684
I am not a bad son.

174
00:36:17.084 --> 00:36:19.116
I'm not.

175
00:36:29.530 --> 00:36:32.362
I am not a bad son!

176
00:36:34.334 --> 00:36:37.901
I am not a bad son!

177
00:36:39.269 --> 00:36:41.938
I'm not a bad son!

178
00:36:50.017 --> 00:36:53.350
I am not a bad son!

179
00:39:02.316 --> 00:39:03.748
<i>Rabbi?</i>

180
00:39:05.919 --> 00:39:07.817
Rabbi!

181
00:39:08.989 --> 00:39:11.288
It hurts.

182
00:39:13.193 --> 00:39:15.896
I want it to be over.

183
00:39:16.196 --> 00:39:18.729
I'm not afraid of death.

184
00:39:19.367 --> 00:39:24.234
I'm only scared of being alone
when I get there.


185
00:39:25.472 --> 00:39:28.005
You will not be alone.

186
00:39:29.709 --> 00:39:32.144
None of us is alone.

187
00:39:40.420 --> 00:39:44.235
Find better words, Yeshua.
You must work at that.


188
00:39:44.624 --> 00:39:46.994
Intention is good, but...

189
00:39:47.094 --> 00:39:50.160
often the words are hollow and useless.

190
00:39:50.831 --> 00:39:53.100
Or better still...

191
00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:55.435
find an action.

192
00:39:55.535 --> 00:39:57.401
Yes.

193
00:39:58.071 --> 00:40:00.770
Action over words. Always.

194
00:40:02.242 --> 00:40:04.641
Otherwise, silence.

195
00:41:57.491 --> 00:42:00.290
You think you are his only child?

196
00:42:02.862 --> 00:42:05.195
There are others.

197
00:42:07.534 --> 00:42:09.432
No.

198
00:42:10.137 --> 00:42:12.536
There is only me.

199
00:42:14.708 --> 00:42:17.207
There is only me.

200
00:42:37.130 --> 00:42:39.663
Look in on your mother.

201
00:42:54.715 --> 00:42:58.385
Did the boy speak with you
when you went to the water?


202
00:42:58.485 --> 00:43:00.550
A little.

203
00:43:05.492 --> 00:43:09.398
I don't know how to talk to him.
The words get caught in my throat.


204
00:43:09.498 --> 00:43:14.568
I fight to push them through
and they come out harsh.


205
00:43:14.668 --> 00:43:17.328
I suppose he thinks I'm angry at him.

206
00:43:19.472 --> 00:43:21.838
He doesn't know me...

207
00:43:22.709 --> 00:43:25.242
and I don't know him.

208
00:43:32.519 --> 00:43:35.840
Any words of advice, holy man?

209
00:43:37.691 --> 00:43:40.907
Talk to him about something
that he's interested in.


210
00:43:42.229 --> 00:43:44.694
What is he interested in?

211
00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:49.204
Riddles.

212
00:43:49.304 --> 00:43:52.189
He makes up a very good riddle.

213
00:43:55.275 --> 00:43:57.471
I don't like riddles.

214
00:44:14.127 --> 00:44:17.798
That shooting star last night.
You enjoyed that.


215
00:44:17.898 --> 00:44:20.501
- It was a bore.
- Liar.


216
00:44:20.601 --> 00:44:23.632
I am a liar. That is the truth.

217
00:44:27.374 --> 00:44:30.677
I've seen every shooting star
since the first one.


218
00:44:30.777 --> 00:44:33.410
Every flash of lightning.

219
00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:37.384
I've heard the last gasp
of each thing that ever lived.


220
00:44:37.484 --> 00:44:39.787
Nothing's interesting anymore.

221
00:44:39.887 --> 00:44:43.553
Nothing surprises you? Not a thing?

222
00:44:48.528 --> 00:44:50.964
The repetitiveness.

223
00:44:51.064 --> 00:44:56.238
The obstinate, dull repetitiveness of your
father's plan is bewildering to me.


224
00:44:56.538 --> 00:45:01.274
The same lives lived over
and over and over and over again.


225
00:45:01.374 --> 00:45:03.511
Is there a plan?

226
00:45:03.611 --> 00:45:07.904
It all has to turn into something, it has to
pour out into something, but into what?


227
00:45:08.615 --> 00:45:11.314
And that's my weakness...

228
00:45:12.185 --> 00:45:14.551
curiosity.

229
00:45:16.590 --> 00:45:19.859
But I'll stay as long
as it takes, forever...


230
00:45:19.959 --> 00:45:21.995
to witness the end.

231
00:45:22.095 --> 00:45:24.844
The final sunset. 
If there is one.

232
00:45:26.266 --> 00:45:30.305
Maybe on that day,
late in the afternoon, seconds away,


233
00:45:30.405 --> 00:45:33.206
he'll want to start it all over again...

234
00:45:33.306 --> 00:45:35.375
from the beginning.

235
00:45:35.475 --> 00:45:40.048
He's done it before. Recreated
the whole thing, retold the whole thing.


236
00:45:40.148 --> 00:45:43.234
On a whim. With little differences
that must mean the world to him,


237
00:45:43.334 --> 00:45:45.520
a branch that crooks
in a different direction,


238
00:45:45.620 --> 00:45:49.319
one egg more or less
in the nest of a flea.


239
00:45:49.790 --> 00:45:52.639
What a self-centered...

240
00:45:52.739 --> 00:45:55.317
self-indulgent creature he is. Isn't he?

241
00:45:55.417 --> 00:45:59.062
Deaf-mute. Insatiable.

242
00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:02.903
These things he expects of you.

243
00:46:03.003 --> 00:46:05.372
Do you think anyone will care?

244
00:46:05.472 --> 00:46:08.371
Men of 1,000 years from now?

245
00:46:18.201 --> 00:46:21.167
What's it like to be in his presence?

246
00:46:26.293 --> 00:46:28.658
Is there a face?

247
00:46:29.228 --> 00:46:31.061
No.

248
00:46:32.966 --> 00:46:34.798
There is no face.

249
00:46:37.036 --> 00:46:39.502
There is no face.

250
00:46:41.208 --> 00:46:44.107
There's a thing that swallows you.

251
00:46:45.679 --> 00:46:50.080
It holds you together while it's
tearing you apart and it's terrifying.


252
00:46:50.917 --> 00:46:53.787
It makes you feel worthless...

253
00:46:53.887 --> 00:46:56.886
and it makes you want to be worthless.

254
00:46:59.459 --> 00:47:03.927
And all the while, it makes you believe
that you and he are one and the same...


255
00:47:05.099 --> 00:47:08.532
That... that is...

256
00:47:12.973 --> 00:47:15.572
Well, that can be quite confusing.

257
00:47:23.184 --> 00:47:25.320
That's how I remember it, anyway.

258
00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:28.923
It's been a million years since he
so much as looked in my direction.


259
00:47:29.023 --> 00:47:33.790
- Your pride made him angry.
- I'm not proud. I am not proud.


260
00:47:34.527 --> 00:47:37.060
He's the proud one.

261
00:47:41.134 --> 00:47:44.305
- How's our little wager going?
- I do not wager.


262
00:47:44.405 --> 00:47:47.436
Oh, dear me, course not.

263
00:47:55.148 --> 00:47:58.585
- What?
- You already know the outcome, don't you?


264
00:47:58.685 --> 00:48:02.690
- No. Not at all.
- Yes. Yes, you do.


265
00:48:02.790 --> 00:48:05.026
I am able to do that generally, yes.

266
00:48:05.126 --> 00:48:09.692
But when it comes to you
and your little things, not always.


267
00:48:14.401 --> 00:48:18.265
I could tell you what would've happened if
you'd passed by this place a moment earlier.


268
00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:23.005
Would you like to know?

269
00:48:27.847 --> 00:48:30.576
The boy would not have met you.

270
00:48:31.385 --> 00:48:33.453
After the mother's death,

271
00:48:33.553 --> 00:48:36.890
his relationship
with the father deteriorates.


272
00:48:36.990 --> 00:48:41.691
He puts up with it for several years,
expecting that the father will not live long.


273
00:48:42.462 --> 00:48:48.435
Eventually, he poisons the father
and is hanged for it.


274
00:48:48.535 --> 00:48:52.540
Along the way, the boy
has a son who remains here.


275
00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:55.572
Like the grandfather, he loves the desert.

276
00:48:57.677 --> 00:49:00.079
That's how it would have been this time.

277
00:49:00.849 --> 00:49:04.085
In previous tellings of the world,
it was all a little different.


278
00:49:04.185 --> 00:49:08.018
Sometimes it was nothing but love
between the father and the son.


279
00:49:09.990 --> 00:49:13.323
That's how your father amuses himself.

280
00:49:17.230 --> 00:49:20.033
Now it's your turn to take a hand.

281
00:49:20.133 --> 00:49:22.532
Can you do any better?

282
00:49:36.416 --> 00:49:38.651
Why do you live here?

283
00:49:38.751 --> 00:49:41.989
Because the desert is ruthless.

284
00:49:42.089 --> 00:49:45.827
It strips you of your vanities,
your illusions, and...


285
00:49:45.927 --> 00:49:49.797
gives you the opportunity
to see yourself for who you are.


286
00:49:50.397 --> 00:49:52.934
Isn't that why you're here?

287
00:49:53.034 --> 00:49:58.301
Because your god speaks louder here?

288
00:49:59.139 --> 00:50:02.438
God speaks wherever a man wants to listen.

289
00:50:08.982 --> 00:50:10.985
What I said to you about my son...

290
00:50:11.085 --> 00:50:14.054
It doesn't matter that we don't talk.

291
00:50:14.154 --> 00:50:16.190
We're not women.

292
00:50:16.290 --> 00:50:19.355
A father talks through example.

293
00:50:23.130 --> 00:50:26.029
He's the best boy in the world.

294
00:50:28.769 --> 00:50:31.868
Too good, perhaps.

295
00:50:38.511 --> 00:50:42.450
Do you see that?
The smooth rock jutting out.


296
00:50:42.550 --> 00:50:44.552
- Just below the crack there.
- The reddish rock?


297
00:50:44.652 --> 00:50:47.688
Yes. That's Jasper stone. 
I'm sure of it.

298
00:50:47.788 --> 00:50:50.358
I need a sample to take to market.

299
00:50:50.458 --> 00:50:54.528
- I would share any profits with you.
- No, that wouldn't be necessary.


300
00:50:54.628 --> 00:50:59.266
I can't in good conscience allow you
to do more work for nothing.


301
00:50:59.366 --> 00:51:02.799
If you don't want the money,
you give it to the poor.


302
00:51:03.270 --> 00:51:05.868
How would you go about it?

303
00:51:12.946 --> 00:51:15.281
It would take three people.

304
00:51:15.381 --> 00:51:17.584
Two to lower the third.

305
00:51:17.684 --> 00:51:21.410
Yes, that's right.
You and I would lower the boy.


306
00:51:21.510 --> 00:51:23.690
Just to pick at the rock.

307
00:51:23.790 --> 00:51:28.291
And if it's all that I think it is,
I will return with laborers and dig deep.


308
00:51:30.230 --> 00:51:33.329
It could change the course of our lives.

309
00:51:35.668 --> 00:51:38.632
The boy's life, anyway.

310
00:52:05.164 --> 00:52:06.967
I feel better.

311
00:52:07.067 --> 00:52:11.119
You do? Good. That's good.

312
00:52:20.814 --> 00:52:24.146
My mother had this
when she was my age.

313
00:52:24.283 --> 00:52:27.116
And then she was fine.

314
00:52:44.804 --> 00:52:48.274
My father, my sisters and I...

315
00:52:48.374 --> 00:52:51.607
once spent a night in Jaffa.

316
00:52:51.709 --> 00:52:54.180
Did I tell you this already?

317
00:52:54.280 --> 00:52:56.645
Tell me again.

318
00:52:57.750 --> 00:53:01.184
My father's cousin put
us up by the port.

319
00:53:01.988 --> 00:53:04.424
I could barely sleep...

320
00:53:04.524 --> 00:53:07.556
with the sounds of the city...

321
00:53:07.727 --> 00:53:10.393
dogs barking...

322
00:53:10.997 --> 00:53:13.867
music from a wedding...

323
00:53:14.267 --> 00:53:17.233
men quarreling...

324
00:53:18.137 --> 00:53:20.936
a pig brought to slaughter...

325
00:53:22.175 --> 00:53:25.007
a drunk woman laughing.

326
00:53:25.945 --> 00:53:28.477
And the smells...

327
00:53:31.350 --> 00:53:35.351
pepper, cedar wood...

328
00:53:36.189 --> 00:53:38.154
garum.

329
00:53:54.540 --> 00:53:57.339
If you're ever there...

330
00:53:58.411 --> 00:54:00.410
you think of me.

331
00:54:01.748 --> 00:54:04.080
Yes. I will.

332
00:54:22.368 --> 00:54:26.760
I took her to doctors,
brought doctors to her.


333
00:54:27.208 --> 00:54:32.227
Magicians, quacks. 
I tried them all.

334
00:54:34.697 --> 00:54:37.263
She's going to die, holy man.

335
00:54:37.884 --> 00:54:41.117
There is nothing to be done about her.

336
00:54:43.406 --> 00:54:46.515
When her eyes close for the last time...

337
00:54:47.911 --> 00:54:51.301
our whole world will come
to an end forever.


338
00:54:53.499 --> 00:54:57.028
It's stunning, isn't it?

339
00:54:58.271 --> 00:55:01.070
That life ends.

340
00:55:03.810 --> 00:55:06.375
You will meet again.

341
00:55:13.786 --> 00:55:15.890
We will have been here together.

342
00:55:15.990 --> 00:55:18.788
And we leave the boy behind.

343
00:55:20.226 --> 00:55:22.691
That'll have to do.

344
00:56:41.240 --> 00:56:44.273
How far can a
man walk into the desert?

345
00:56:45.644 --> 00:56:47.448
Only halfway.

346
00:56:47.548 --> 00:56:50.145
After that, he's walking out.

347
00:56:59.692 --> 00:57:02.262
When you leave,
you could take me with you.


348
00:57:02.362 --> 00:57:04.198
I could pass for your son.

349
00:57:04.498 --> 00:57:07.134
That would be believable, wouldn't it?

350
00:57:07.234 --> 00:57:10.336
Believable, yes, but nevertheless a lie.

351
00:57:10.436 --> 00:57:12.039
But a lie that wouldn't hurt anyone.

352
00:57:12.139 --> 00:57:14.691
My mother and father
wouldn't be there to hear it.


353
00:57:14.791 --> 00:57:17.556
A lie hurts the person who tells it.

354
00:57:23.649 --> 00:57:27.888
You could adopt me.
That way it wouldn't be a lie.


355
00:57:27.988 --> 00:57:31.220
The Romans do it all the time,
adopt each other.


356
00:57:40.700 --> 00:57:43.632
Have you found what you
were looking for out here?


357
00:57:46.939 --> 00:57:49.805
Yes. Yes, I have.

358
00:57:50.810 --> 00:57:53.309
What were you looking for?

359
00:57:56.416 --> 00:58:00.282
I was looking for a place to reflect
and to pray in peace.


360
00:58:01.921 --> 00:58:05.187
A place to look
inward and to find myself.

361
00:58:08.661 --> 00:58:11.325
I walk out there, too.

362
00:58:13.699 --> 00:58:15.803
Sometimes when I'm out there,

363
00:58:15.903 --> 00:58:18.801
I feel this thing rising inside of me,

364
00:58:19.739 --> 00:58:23.027
that I am everything
and that everything is me.


365
00:58:23.810 --> 00:58:27.009
That I will always be alive. Forever.

366
00:58:30.149 --> 00:58:34.353
And it's very conceited,
I know, to feel that way.


367
00:58:34.453 --> 00:58:37.052
I'm ashamed of that feeling.

368
00:59:13.726 --> 00:59:16.863
Some wine, holy man?

369
00:59:16.963 --> 00:59:19.028
No. Thank you.

370
00:59:26.772 --> 00:59:30.239
Boy. Boy.

371
01:00:40.813 --> 01:00:43.416
You are an easy target.

372
01:00:43.516 --> 01:00:46.048
Because you're weak.

373
01:01:05.171 --> 01:01:08.349
- How's your mother doing?
- She's feeling better.


374
01:01:08.449 --> 01:01:11.039
She thinks it's passing.

375
01:01:18.617 --> 01:01:21.116
Take your knife, boy.

376
01:01:28.861 --> 01:01:31.427
Just in case.

377
01:02:39.332 --> 01:02:42.069
If I had fallen behind like that,

378
01:02:42.169 --> 01:02:45.934
my father would have caned me
on the soles of my feet.


379
01:03:04.022 --> 01:03:05.854
Come.

380
01:03:23.342 --> 01:03:27.648
I am stronger than 10 men...

381
01:03:27.748 --> 01:03:32.247
and I am taller than 10 men,
but a boy can carry me.


382
01:03:32.584 --> 01:03:34.883
What am I?

383
01:03:37.023 --> 01:03:39.388
It's a riddle.

384
01:03:42.061 --> 01:03:44.231
I am stronger than 10 men,

385
01:03:44.331 --> 01:03:47.809
I'm longer than 10 men,
and a boy can carry me.


386
01:03:47.909 --> 01:03:50.132
What am I?

387
01:03:56.609 --> 01:03:58.841
A rope.

388
01:04:00.712 --> 01:04:02.638
It's a rope.

389
01:04:43.622 --> 01:04:45.521
Come.

390
01:04:46.258 --> 01:04:48.156
Come.

391
01:04:50.679 --> 01:04:52.849
Do you see that piece of rock?

392
01:04:52.949 --> 01:04:55.653
The holy man and I
will lower you with rope.


393
01:04:55.753 --> 01:05:00.285
All you have to do is chisel out a piece
and we'll pull you back up.


394
01:05:01.406 --> 01:05:03.305
No.

395
01:05:05.311 --> 01:05:08.113
No. I'm not going down there.

396
01:05:08.213 --> 01:05:10.445
You will.

397
01:05:11.417 --> 01:05:14.354
No. You know I'm afraid
of falling from high places.


398
01:05:14.454 --> 01:05:17.085
That is precisely why you will do it.

399
01:05:17.856 --> 01:05:20.644
I will not do it!
I'm not going down there!


400
01:05:20.744 --> 01:05:23.497
You will not disobey me.
You will regret it.


401
01:05:23.597 --> 01:05:27.549
He knows I'm scared to death of heights.
What kind of father asks me to do this?


402
01:05:30.003 --> 01:05:32.478
Please. Please, let him go.
Let him go. I can go down.


403
01:05:32.578 --> 01:05:35.303
I'll do it. I'll do it.

404
01:06:18.183 --> 01:06:20.716
I will go down myself.

405
01:06:21.187 --> 01:06:25.954
Do you think it can be done?
Just you and the boy to hold the ropes?


406
01:06:30.862 --> 01:06:32.461
Yes.

407
01:09:24.302 --> 01:09:26.163
Boy!

408
01:09:26.538 --> 01:09:30.317
Cut yourself from the rope.
You too, holy man.


409
01:09:30.677 --> 01:09:33.975
I'll only drag you
over if I slip again.

410
01:10:48.854 --> 01:10:50.753
No!

411
01:12:12.570 --> 01:12:14.098
What is it?

412
01:12:17.175 --> 01:12:20.107
What is it? What is it?

413
01:14:38.183 --> 01:14:41.148
I don't want my mother
to see him like this.


414
01:16:12.444 --> 01:16:15.309
He looks so much smaller now, doesn't he?

415
01:16:52.250 --> 01:16:54.092
You are a good son.

416
01:18:36.654 --> 01:18:38.757
Your son loves you.

417
01:18:38.857 --> 01:18:41.094
Your son loves you.

418
01:18:41.194 --> 01:18:44.926
Your son loves you.
He is your son and he loves you.


419
01:19:16.528 --> 01:19:19.660
Am I expected to just walk away now?

420
01:19:21.249 --> 01:19:24.081
As if I'd never met these people?

421
01:19:24.902 --> 01:19:27.533
As if they mean nothing to me?

422
01:20:38.243 --> 01:20:40.108
Mother!

423
01:20:42.513 --> 01:20:44.379
Mother!

424
01:24:16.293 --> 01:24:18.192
Go.

425
01:24:19.063 --> 01:24:21.462
Please, go.

426
01:24:34.746 --> 01:24:39.118
If I leave here without a blessing,
I won't make it one night out there.


427
01:24:39.218 --> 01:24:43.020
A boy needs his father's permission
to become a man.


428
01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:45.286
It's perverse, isn't it?

429
01:24:54.832 --> 01:24:57.499
Love God above all things.

430
01:25:00.705 --> 01:25:03.037
Love life.

431
01:25:41.679 --> 01:25:43.148
Show me his destiny.

432
01:25:43.248 --> 01:25:46.113
- Yeshua...
- Show me now!


433
01:26:17.148 --> 01:26:20.752
You could have pulled the father up
and seven heavier men if you'd wanted to.


434
01:26:20.852 --> 01:26:23.083
That's nonsense.

435
01:26:30.261 --> 01:26:32.673
No. She's mine!

436
01:27:26.917 --> 01:27:28.816
No.

437
01:27:52.643 --> 01:27:55.375
Who the hell do you think you are?

438
01:28:46.163 --> 01:28:48.662
This is it for me.

439
01:28:50.385 --> 01:28:53.517
You didn't think I was going
to walk you all the way, did you?


440
01:28:54.038 --> 01:28:56.140
Why here?

441
01:28:56.540 --> 01:28:58.839
My feet hurt.

442
01:29:17.562 --> 01:29:19.665
I'll come to you in the end.

443
01:29:19.765 --> 01:29:22.762
And if you give me a sign
I'll help you down...


444
01:29:22.862 --> 01:29:25.163
and you can stay.

445
01:29:37.398 --> 01:29:39.930
Give my regards to the old man.
