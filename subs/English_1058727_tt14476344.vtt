Let's go.

15
00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.536
You two are about as slow
as a herd of turtles.


16
00:01:17.536 --> 00:01:18.911
What do you think you're doing?

17
00:01:18.911 --> 00:01:20.952
- We were just--
- Just trying to snatch up


18
00:01:20.952 --> 00:01:24.161
some of this chicken I just
pulled out of the fryer.


19
00:01:24.161 --> 00:01:25.494
I told you.

20
00:01:25.494 --> 00:01:26.952
What's going on here?

21
00:01:26.952 --> 00:01:29.036
Nothing!
We're just talking.


22
00:01:29.036 --> 00:01:33.077
Okay. The kitchen isn't any
place to be playing around.


23
00:01:33.077 --> 00:01:35.161
Yes, Dad.

24
00:01:35.161 --> 00:01:37.535
That goes for you too,
young Jacob.


25
00:01:37.535 --> 00:01:39.535
Yes, Mr. Rider.

26
00:01:44.411 --> 00:01:47.453
- How was the pastry?
- Needed salt.


27
00:01:47.453 --> 00:01:49.411
That's what I said.

28
00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.411
Shh.

29
00:01:54.411 --> 00:01:56.036
Thanks, Grandma!

30
00:01:56.494 --> 00:01:57.785
Let's go.

31
00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:01.369
Oh.

32
00:02:24.952 --> 00:02:29.411
If I could eat one food
for the rest of my life,


33
00:02:29.411 --> 00:02:32.119
it would be
Grandma CC's chicken.


34
00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:33.952
What about you?

35
00:02:33.952 --> 00:02:35.077
Same.

36
00:02:35.077 --> 00:02:37.702
You can't choose
the same food as me.


37
00:02:39.994 --> 00:02:42.785
Well, then I choose ice cream.

38
00:02:42.785 --> 00:02:46.036
Dang, that's a good one.

39
00:02:49.077 --> 00:02:50.744
You think you'll be a chef
like your dad and grandma


40
00:02:50.744 --> 00:02:53.077
when you grow up?

41
00:02:53.077 --> 00:02:56.036
The most famous chef
in the world.


42
00:02:56.036 --> 00:02:59.994
Except I want to live
somewhere fancy...


43
00:02:59.994 --> 00:03:02.119
like New York...

44
00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:03.494
Paris...

45
00:03:03.494 --> 00:03:05.869
somewhere like that.

46
00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:08.660
Maybe I'll live there, too.

47
00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.369
You want to live in a big city?

48
00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:11.994
As long as I'm with you.

49
00:03:15.203 --> 00:03:17.411

62
00:04:10.119 --> 00:04:12.619
Welcome back, everyone!
I'm Taylor Rider.


63
00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:14.328
And in case you're
just joining us,


64
00:04:14.328 --> 00:04:15.786
today I am teaching you

65
00:04:15.786 --> 00:04:18.660
how to turn your basic
big game party platters


66
00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.119
into dishes that
will make your entire team


67
00:04:21.119 --> 00:04:23.535
cheer touchdown!

68
00:04:23.535 --> 00:04:26.994
Now, over here, we have a fresh
take on a classic party staple,


69
00:04:26.994 --> 00:04:28.827
chili con queso.

70
00:04:28.827 --> 00:04:30.744
Let's hold for a moment.
Taylor, can you do that again?


71
00:04:30.744 --> 00:04:33.119
Just with a little more
enthusiasm, if you can.


72
00:04:33.119 --> 00:04:36.286
Big smile.

73
00:04:36.286 --> 00:04:38.161
Just like that.

74
00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:46.286
Now, over here, we have a fresh
take on a classic party staple,


75
00:04:46.286 --> 00:04:48.119
chili con queso.

76
00:04:48.119 --> 00:04:49.619
I prepared it all
before the break,


77
00:04:49.619 --> 00:04:52.994
so let's check on it
and see how it tastes.


78
00:04:52.994 --> 00:04:57.661
To finish the dish, you want to
add one scoop of sour cream,


79
00:04:57.661 --> 00:05:00.119
and some chives.

80
00:05:00.119 --> 00:05:03.286
Little bit or a lot,
that is up to you.


81
00:05:03.286 --> 00:05:06.286
Give it a stir.

82
00:05:06.286 --> 00:05:09.161
And...

83
00:05:09.452 --> 00:05:11.744
Dun-dun-dun-dun-dah-dah.

84
00:05:13.994 --> 00:05:19.119
Mm. Oh. I cannot wait for you
to try this at home.


85
00:05:19.119 --> 00:05:22.369
Seriously, it's gonna wow
all of your party guests.


86
00:05:22.369 --> 00:05:25.744
And the best part is,

87
00:05:25.744 --> 00:05:26.911
- it's quick,
- It's quick!


88
00:05:26.911 --> 00:05:28.369
- it's easy,
- It's easy!


89
00:05:28.369 --> 00:05:30.452
- and it's delicious.
- And it's delicious!


90
00:05:30.452 --> 00:05:31.702
That's right!

91
00:05:31.702 --> 00:05:34.244
I'm Taylor June Rider,
and as always,


92
00:05:34.244 --> 00:05:37.036
thank you for inviting me
to the party.


93
00:05:37.827 --> 00:05:41.577
Cut! All right, everyone.
That is a wrap on this episode


94
00:05:41.577 --> 00:05:44.285
and the third and final season
of Quick, Easy, and Delicious.


95
00:05:44.285 --> 00:05:46.161
Thank you, everybody.

96
00:05:48.911 --> 00:05:52.535
Taylor, what a way
to cap off the season.


97
00:05:52.535 --> 00:05:53.953
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

98
00:05:53.953 --> 00:05:56.161
Seriously, I never wanted
to throw a tailgate party


99
00:05:56.161 --> 00:06:00.994
so bad in my life,
and I don't even like sports.


100
00:06:00.994 --> 00:06:02.619
I do my best.

101
00:06:02.619 --> 00:06:04.452
So what brings you
down to the trenches?


102
00:06:04.452 --> 00:06:06.244
Good news, I hope.

103
00:06:06.244 --> 00:06:09.369
Well, I locked in a meeting
tomorrow at 9:00 AM


104
00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:11.078
with the network president.

105
00:06:11.078 --> 00:06:12.953
I assume you'll be
able to make that?


106
00:06:12.953 --> 00:06:15.661
Yes, absolutely.
Of course. Thank you.


107
00:06:15.661 --> 00:06:17.327
No need to thank me.
You earned it.


108
00:06:17.327 --> 00:06:20.953
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Yeppers, I'll see you tomorrow!


109
00:06:20.953 --> 00:06:23.036
Yeppers...

110
00:06:23.036 --> 00:06:24.661
Yeppers?

111
00:06:26.577 --> 00:06:28.661
Man. No I don't--

112
00:06:31.744 --> 00:06:33.786
Remember,
good chimichurri is all


113
00:06:33.786 --> 00:06:35.869
about the fresh ingredients.

114
00:06:35.869 --> 00:06:37.953
Now, you don't want to turn
the ingredients into paste,


115
00:06:37.953 --> 00:06:40.786
but you do want to smash
everything up just enough


116
00:06:40.786 --> 00:06:43.744
to fuse the flavors.

117
00:06:45.327 --> 00:06:47.369
My mom always says,

118
00:06:47.369 --> 00:06:48.786
"Cuando cocinas con el corazon,

119
00:06:48.786 --> 00:06:51.119
es imposible hacer un mal
plato."


120
00:06:51.119 --> 00:06:54.036
"When you cook from the heart,
it's impossible to make


121
00:06:54.036 --> 00:06:56.244
a bad dish."

122
00:06:56.244 --> 00:06:58.119
From my childhood to yours.

123
00:07:08.036 --> 00:07:09.702
Come in!

124
00:07:12.161 --> 00:07:14.536
I just heard the great news
about your meeting tomorrow!


125
00:07:14.536 --> 00:07:17.786
Congratulations!

126
00:07:18.953 --> 00:07:20.619
Oh!

127
00:07:20.619 --> 00:07:23.285
It is time to finally
put QED behind us


128
00:07:23.285 --> 00:07:26.953
and show the world who
Taylor Rider really is!


129
00:07:26.953 --> 00:07:29.953
I can see you now standing
alongside the titans,


130
00:07:29.953 --> 00:07:32.786
Rachael Ray, Stephen Coe,
and Annabelle Fisher!


131
00:07:32.786 --> 00:07:35.161
Okay. Let's not
get ahead of ourselves.


132
00:07:35.161 --> 00:07:36.452
We should celebrate.

133
00:07:36.452 --> 00:07:37.702
I've been dying to try
that new place


134
00:07:37.702 --> 00:07:39.285
that just opened up
around the corner.


135
00:07:39.285 --> 00:07:42.786
I would love to, but I can't
tonight 'cause I have a date.


136
00:07:42.786 --> 00:07:45.619
Who's the lucky guy?
Give me all the deets.


137
00:07:45.619 --> 00:07:49.619
His name is Tim.
He's a self-proclaimed foodie.


138
00:07:49.619 --> 00:07:52.953
And technically
we have not met yet.


139
00:07:52.953 --> 00:07:55.786
Dating app again?
It's nothing to be ashamed of.


140
00:07:55.786 --> 00:07:57.828
Everybody's on them.

141
00:07:57.828 --> 00:07:59.953
It kind of seems like
a digital meat market.


142
00:07:59.953 --> 00:08:02.494
Oh, please. Every girl has
to kiss a couple of frogs


143
00:08:02.494 --> 00:08:03.911
before she finds her prince.

144
00:08:03.911 --> 00:08:05.911
And trust me,
your prince is out there.


145
00:08:05.911 --> 00:08:08.744
And I bet you
he is fine.


146
00:08:19.494 --> 00:08:21.244
I give up.

147
00:08:21.244 --> 00:08:22.869
Could I get some ketchup

148
00:08:22.869 --> 00:08:24.869
that's already out of the
bottle?


149
00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:28.119
Right away, sir.

150
00:08:28.119 --> 00:08:30.285
Thanks.

151
00:08:31.494 --> 00:08:34.536
What kind of fancy restaurant
brings you ketchup in a bottle?


152
00:08:34.536 --> 00:08:35.786
You should try a
bite without it.


153
00:08:35.786 --> 00:08:39.119
Nah. No.
I'm a ketchup kind of guy.


154
00:08:39.119 --> 00:08:40.786
I mean, let's be honest.

155
00:08:40.786 --> 00:08:42.786
What doesn't taste better
with a little ketchup, right?


156
00:08:44.244 --> 00:08:46.619
So I should ask you,

157
00:08:46.619 --> 00:08:50.828
how does someone become
a Culinary Network chef?


158
00:08:50.828 --> 00:08:52.702
I entered a food competition
a few years ago


159
00:08:52.702 --> 00:08:54.786
and took first place.
What about you?


160
00:08:54.786 --> 00:08:57.160
Were you a chef
before that or...


161
00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:59.536
I was a sous chef at a boutique
restaurant in New York for years


162
00:08:59.536 --> 00:09:01.244
before the network
snatched me up.


163
00:09:01.244 --> 00:09:04.119
But I've been around
food my whole life.


164
00:09:04.119 --> 00:09:08.202
And now you finally have
a career worth pursuing.


165
00:09:08.202 --> 00:09:10.119
What does that mean?

166
00:09:10.119 --> 00:09:13.494
Who wants to grind 12 hours a
day in a kitchen? Am I right?


167
00:09:13.494 --> 00:09:16.619
I mean, what's the fun in that?

168
00:09:16.619 --> 00:09:18.994
It's not the most
glamorous job at times,


169
00:09:18.994 --> 00:09:22.202
but when you create food
from your heart and soul that


170
00:09:22.202 --> 00:09:26.661
people genuinely love, there
is something magical about it.


171
00:09:27.661 --> 00:09:30.036
- Your ketchup, sir.
- Thanks, boss.


172
00:09:31.619 --> 00:09:33.911
You know, not to
overstate the obvious,


173
00:09:33.911 --> 00:09:36.369
but I'm a pretty
big foodie myself.


174
00:09:36.369 --> 00:09:39.994
Mm-hmm, I saw that
on your profile.


175
00:09:40.744 --> 00:09:43.160
You should let me cook
for you sometime.


176
00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:45.494
I promise.

177
00:09:45.494 --> 00:09:47.744
I will not disappoint.

178
00:09:59.494 --> 00:10:02.327
Hey.
You back at the office?


179
00:10:02.327 --> 00:10:04.285
Burning the midnight oil.

180
00:10:04.285 --> 00:10:05.869
So how'd it go?

181
00:10:05.869 --> 00:10:08.411
Horrible.
I should have canceled.


182
00:10:08.411 --> 00:10:11.202
You found a thing, didn't you?

183
00:10:11.202 --> 00:10:12.494
What do you mean a thing?

184
00:10:12.494 --> 00:10:14.661
Don't play coy with me.
I know you.


185
00:10:14.661 --> 00:10:18.285
There was definitely a thing.

186
00:10:18.285 --> 00:10:20.494
I don't...

187
00:10:21.119 --> 00:10:24.661
Okay. He put ketchup
on his beef Wellington.


188
00:10:24.661 --> 00:10:26.119
I mean, who does that?

189
00:10:26.119 --> 00:10:28.119
He takes me to the nicest
restaurant in downtown


190
00:10:28.119 --> 00:10:31.119
and then put ketchup
on his Wellington.


191
00:10:31.119 --> 00:10:34.994
And it wasn't just a little bit.
It was like a whole layer.


192
00:10:34.994 --> 00:10:37.452
You're on another level
right now. I cannot with you.


193
00:10:37.452 --> 00:10:40.703
I'm sorry.
It was barbaric.


194
00:10:40.703 --> 00:10:42.953
I see a lot of cats
in your future.


195
00:10:42.953 --> 00:10:44.369
Are you saying I'm picky?

196
00:10:44.369 --> 00:10:47.119
I am particular, not picky.

197
00:10:47.119 --> 00:10:52.035
Yeah? Um, what about that
hot architect you went out with?


198
00:10:52.035 --> 00:10:54.661
We both agreed the pitch
of his voice was too high.


199
00:10:54.661 --> 00:10:56.202
It was like nails
on a chalkboard.


200
00:10:56.202 --> 00:10:59.411
And um,
that bartender you met?


201
00:10:59.411 --> 00:11:01.494
Oh, jeans and flip-flops guy?

202
00:11:01.494 --> 00:11:03.285
Don't even get me
started on him.


203
00:11:03.285 --> 00:11:06.119
And now, ketchup.

204
00:11:08.369 --> 00:11:10.661
You might be a little right.

205
00:11:10.911 --> 00:11:14.119
Admitting you have a problem
is the first step.


206
00:11:14.119 --> 00:11:15.536
It's that bad?

207
00:11:15.536 --> 00:11:17.619
We'll get into all that later.

208
00:11:17.619 --> 00:11:19.952
Mr. Ketchup Man
can go sauce himself.


209
00:11:19.952 --> 00:11:22.952
How are you feeling
about tomorrow?


210
00:11:25.952 --> 00:11:31.119
Nervous. Scared.
What if it's not good enough?


211
00:11:31.119 --> 00:11:33.786
You are the most
creative and charismatic


212
00:11:33.786 --> 00:11:37.202
TV chef I know.
Why all the doubt?


213
00:11:37.202 --> 00:11:38.744
I don't know.

214
00:11:38.744 --> 00:11:40.494
Three years of being pigeonholed
into party platters


215
00:11:40.494 --> 00:11:43.786
and finger foods can really take
a toll on a chef's confidence.


216
00:11:43.786 --> 00:11:47.119
Water under the bridge.
All you need to focus on


217
00:11:47.119 --> 00:11:50.661
is knocking the stuffing out
of that meeting tomorrow.


218
00:11:50.661 --> 00:11:53.244
You're right.

219
00:11:53.244 --> 00:11:55.869
Positive affirmations, baby.

220
00:11:55.869 --> 00:11:57.619
And get some sleep.

221
00:11:57.619 --> 00:11:59.411
Goodnight.

222
00:12:02.578 --> 00:12:04.327
It's gonna be great.
It's gonna be great.


223
00:12:06.369 --> 00:12:08.286
It's going to be great.

224
00:12:32.661 --> 00:12:34.369
There she is.

225
00:12:34.369 --> 00:12:36.119
Good morning, Mr. Thompson.

226
00:12:36.119 --> 00:12:38.286
Mrs. Smithers, it is so good
to finally meet you.


227
00:12:38.286 --> 00:12:40.661
- Now, please have a seat.
- Thank you.


228
00:12:42.828 --> 00:12:46.661
And these are for you.

229
00:12:56.035 --> 00:12:58.119
Mr. Thompson,
you want to start us off?


230
00:12:58.119 --> 00:13:02.286
Sure. Taylor, for the past
three years, your audience base


231
00:13:02.286 --> 00:13:04.619
has nearly doubled
with each new episode.


232
00:13:04.619 --> 00:13:06.786
And yesterday's final episode
landed QED


233
00:13:06.786 --> 00:13:08.744
as the third highest watched
show currently running.


234
00:13:08.744 --> 00:13:10.494
Congratulations.

235
00:13:10.494 --> 00:13:11.994
That's great!
Who knew?


236
00:13:11.994 --> 00:13:16.703
Exactly. So if it isn't broke,
why fix it, right?


237
00:13:16.703 --> 00:13:18.786
I know a lot of work
went into this.


238
00:13:18.786 --> 00:13:21.119
But to be frank,
we don't need another show


239
00:13:21.119 --> 00:13:23.286
featuring complicated food
that most of our audience


240
00:13:23.286 --> 00:13:25.327
can't even make.

241
00:13:25.327 --> 00:13:27.786
What we need is this.

242
00:13:30.161 --> 00:13:32.661
Ta-da!

243
00:13:33.994 --> 00:13:36.786
I...
I don't understand.


244
00:13:36.786 --> 00:13:39.452
We're moving QED to primetime
and increasing your budget.


245
00:13:39.452 --> 00:13:41.327
And, of course, your pay.

246
00:13:41.661 --> 00:13:43.786
Now, America loves you,
Taylor Rider.


247
00:13:43.786 --> 00:13:47.327
And what they love just
as much is food that's...


248
00:13:47.327 --> 00:13:50.119
Quick, easy, and delicious.

249
00:13:51.202 --> 00:13:52.661
So what do you say?

250
00:13:57.244 --> 00:14:00.411
I can't believe you said no.

251
00:14:00.411 --> 00:14:02.744
I can't believe no's all I said.

252
00:14:03.869 --> 00:14:06.161
QED is such a gimmick.

253
00:14:06.161 --> 00:14:09.453
But thanks to you, that gimmick
made the network a lot of money.


254
00:14:09.453 --> 00:14:11.952
You can't blame them for
not being ready to let it go.


255
00:14:11.952 --> 00:14:13.661
I know.
You're right.


256
00:14:13.661 --> 00:14:15.619
And I don't want
to seem ungrateful.


257
00:14:15.619 --> 00:14:17.910
It's just time
for me to move on.


258
00:14:19.244 --> 00:14:21.035
- Okay. You ready?
- Yes.


259
00:14:22.869 --> 00:14:24.910
You are going to love it.

260
00:14:26.578 --> 00:14:28.161
- Uh-uh. Wait, wait, wait.
- Okay.


261
00:14:29.994 --> 00:14:31.744
And bon appetit.

262
00:14:35.827 --> 00:14:37.286
Mm.

263
00:14:39.286 --> 00:14:42.869
If I could cook like that,
I would never leave the kitchen.


264
00:14:42.869 --> 00:14:45.077
If I could move past

265
00:14:45.077 --> 00:14:48.244
that aren't even my own,
maybe I could teach you.


266
00:14:48.244 --> 00:14:50.035
Cute.

267
00:14:50.035 --> 00:14:52.161
I understand your frustration,

268
00:14:52.161 --> 00:14:55.785
but you have got to
keep your eye on the prize.


269
00:14:55.785 --> 00:14:59.494
Primetime is a huge opportunity.

270
00:14:59.494 --> 00:15:02.619
- Is it, though?
- Yeah, it is!


271
00:15:02.619 --> 00:15:05.244
Within months,
you'll be a household name


272
00:15:05.244 --> 00:15:07.661
with your own product line,
your own cookbooks.


273
00:15:07.661 --> 00:15:10.952
And once that happens,
the world is your oyster.


274
00:15:10.952 --> 00:15:14.703
I'm talking dollar
dollar bills, baby.


275
00:15:15.202 --> 00:15:18.619
Speaking of dollar dollar bills,
I'm canceling my flights.


276
00:15:18.619 --> 00:15:20.994
I can't go back home.
I need to look for a job.


277
00:15:20.994 --> 00:15:22.994
Absolutely not.

278
00:15:22.994 --> 00:15:24.785
What?

279
00:15:24.785 --> 00:15:26.327
You need to clear your head
before making any more


280
00:15:26.327 --> 00:15:28.161
network decisions.

281
00:15:28.161 --> 00:15:30.453
There are no more network
decisions to be made.


282
00:15:30.453 --> 00:15:32.077
I already said no.

283
00:15:32.077 --> 00:15:34.952
No.
No.


284
00:15:34.952 --> 00:15:38.244
You had a temporary
lapse in judgment


285
00:15:38.244 --> 00:15:39.827
because you're exhausted

286
00:15:39.827 --> 00:15:43.661
from three long,
very successful seasons of QED.


287
00:15:43.661 --> 00:15:46.952
But soon you'll be
calm and relaxed.


288
00:15:46.952 --> 00:15:49.619
And I'll relay to the network
that you're sorry


289
00:15:49.619 --> 00:15:50.910
and you're grateful.

290
00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:52.494
And looking forward
to their official offer.


291
00:15:52.494 --> 00:15:55.411
- But--
- No buts. No buts.


292
00:15:55.411 --> 00:15:57.910
As your agent
and dear friend,


293
00:15:57.910 --> 00:16:00.660
that is our story
and we're sticking to it.


294
00:16:01.619 --> 00:16:04.036
Eat your sandwich.

295
00:16:04.036 --> 00:16:05.660

H
-Hi.

308
00:17:34.494 --> 00:17:36.161
Hi.

309
00:17:37.328 --> 00:17:38.952
What are you doing here?

310
00:17:38.952 --> 00:17:42.785
I'm just making a delivery.
What, what are you doing here?


311
00:17:42.785 --> 00:17:45.453
I finally got some time off,
so I decided to fly home.


312
00:17:45.453 --> 00:17:48.911
Wow. Good for you.

313
00:17:49.411 --> 00:17:51.453
Do you know where my parents
are? I thought they'd be here.


314
00:17:51.453 --> 00:17:52.994
So did I.

315
00:17:52.994 --> 00:17:55.036
I didn't know they were
doing renovations.


316
00:17:55.036 --> 00:17:57.952
Here, I, uh,
got some cinnamon buns.


317
00:17:57.952 --> 00:17:59.827
I thought maybe I'd
give it to Glenn and Patty,


318
00:17:59.827 --> 00:18:01.994
but I'm sure you could
pass 'em along for me.


319
00:18:01.994 --> 00:18:03.660
That's sweet.

320
00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:07.494
So, how's TV chef life
treating you?


321
00:18:07.494 --> 00:18:11.119
Great. Looks like they're gonna
move the show to primetime.


322
00:18:11.119 --> 00:18:13.952
Wow. Pretty soon, all of America
is going to know


323
00:18:13.952 --> 00:18:17.619
the culinary secrets behind
Taylor Rider's famous party dip.


324
00:18:17.619 --> 00:18:20.286
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

325
00:18:20.286 --> 00:18:23.494
Well, I, I better get going.
People to see,


326
00:18:23.494 --> 00:18:25.411
deliveries to make.

327
00:18:25.411 --> 00:18:27.785
Right. Of course.
Good to see you.


328
00:18:29.036 --> 00:18:31.494
You know, we're, uh, throwing
a surprise party for Jordan


329
00:18:31.494 --> 00:18:32.952
tonight at the Fenway.

330
00:18:32.952 --> 00:18:35.203
Right. It's his birthday.

331
00:18:35.203 --> 00:18:37.328
You should come.

332
00:18:37.328 --> 00:18:38.619
What time?

333
00:18:38.619 --> 00:18:40.411
It starts at 6:30.

334
00:18:40.411 --> 00:18:41.744
I might be able to swing that.

335
00:18:41.744 --> 00:18:44.328
He'd really love to see you.

336
00:18:44.328 --> 00:18:47.577
Yeah, I'd love to see him.

337
00:18:47.827 --> 00:18:49.494
Thank you again for the buns.

338
00:18:49.494 --> 00:18:54.036
Oh, yeah. It was no problem.
They were quick and easy, and--


339
00:18:55.577 --> 00:18:57.286
It's good to see you,
Taylor Rider.


340
00:18:57.286 --> 00:18:59.119
You too.

341
00:19:10.869 --> 00:19:13.036
Oh.

342
00:19:17.702 --> 00:19:20.036
- Hey, Mom!
- Taylor, oh!


343
00:19:20.702 --> 00:19:22.911
I'm so happy to be home.

344
00:19:22.911 --> 00:19:25.203
It's so good to have you home.

345
00:19:25.203 --> 00:19:26.827
Listen, I tried to call you.

346
00:19:26.827 --> 00:19:28.369
Why weren't you guys
at the restaurant?


347
00:19:28.369 --> 00:19:30.869
Oh, um, well, let's talk
about that later.


348
00:19:30.869 --> 00:19:32.328
Let's go in and see Dad.

349
00:19:32.328 --> 00:19:34.077
Oh, yes.
Oh, I've missed him.


350
00:19:34.077 --> 00:19:37.286
Oh, my gosh.
The place looks so great.


351
00:19:39.036 --> 00:19:41.452
- Is that my Junebug?
- Dad!


352
00:19:41.452 --> 00:19:43.744
Oh, oh, oh.

353
00:19:46.036 --> 00:19:48.869
- What's wrong?
- Nothing. Nothing.


354
00:19:48.869 --> 00:19:52.036
This rascal fell off a ladder
painting the other day.


355
00:19:52.036 --> 00:19:54.286
- Oh, Dad.
- It's nothing. It's nothing.


356
00:19:54.286 --> 00:19:55.952
Nothing to worry about.
Don't concern yourself.


357
00:19:55.952 --> 00:19:58.244
Wait. Painting?
Was that at the restaurant?


358
00:19:58.244 --> 00:20:00.411
Is that what all
the tarps were about?


359
00:20:00.411 --> 00:20:03.494
Oh, you stopped
by the restaurant?


360
00:20:03.494 --> 00:20:07.994
Yeah. I was gonna surprise you.
And then Jacob showed up.


361
00:20:07.994 --> 00:20:09.786
Oh, shoot.
We forgot to cancel the order.


362
00:20:09.786 --> 00:20:11.286
You were supposed to remind me.

363
00:20:11.286 --> 00:20:13.119
Oh, excuse me.
I've been a little preoccupied.


364
00:20:13.119 --> 00:20:14.869
- Thank you very much.
- Oh, please.


365
00:20:14.869 --> 00:20:16.660
It's only a couple
of bruised ribs.


366
00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:19.660
Which the doctor said was on
the verge of being fractured.


367
00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:23.827
Hence no heavy lifting,
yard work, laundry or dishes.


368
00:20:23.827 --> 00:20:26.078
If you can stand,
you can do dishes.


369
00:20:26.078 --> 00:20:28.660
- Nice try though.
- It was worth a shot.


370
00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:30.577
Busted.

371
00:20:30.577 --> 00:20:33.660
He might be a little clumsy,
but he is a tough guy.


372
00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:37.744
- I am strong like bull.
- Oh, Dad, the macho man.


373
00:20:37.744 --> 00:20:39.494
My beauty, you are so beautiful.

374
00:20:39.494 --> 00:20:40.494
Get your stuff?

375
00:20:40.494 --> 00:20:41.994
Oh, no, no, Mom.
I got the luggage.


376
00:20:41.994 --> 00:20:43.494
You stay focused on that
prime rib in the oven.


377
00:20:43.494 --> 00:20:45.328
How'd you know?

378
00:20:45.328 --> 00:20:46.952
I could smell the garlic
and rosemary when I walked in.


379
00:20:46.952 --> 00:20:48.286
Oh.

380
00:20:48.286 --> 00:20:50.494
Like father, like daughter.

381
00:20:50.494 --> 00:20:53.078
Whew.

382
00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:56.286
- Do we have an aspirin?
- Yeah.


383
00:20:56.286 --> 00:20:58.244
- I'll get you some.
- Thank you.


384
00:21:01.203 --> 00:21:02.827
This is heaven.

385
00:21:02.827 --> 00:21:04.494
I'm really glad
that you're here.


386
00:21:04.494 --> 00:21:05.702
Oh, me too.

387
00:21:06.952 --> 00:21:11.036
So now the work's over,
what's next?


388
00:21:11.036 --> 00:21:12.869
Actually, they're thinking
of picking up QED


389
00:21:12.869 --> 00:21:14.994
for a few more seasons.

390
00:21:14.994 --> 00:21:17.328
I just found out
a couple days ago.


391
00:21:17.328 --> 00:21:19.119
Well, that's wonderful.
Maybe now they'll let you do


392
00:21:19.119 --> 00:21:21.452
some of your own recipes
for once.


393
00:21:21.452 --> 00:21:23.660
Stop, Glenn.

394
00:21:25.494 --> 00:21:28.702
Well, outside of work, is there
anything else that's new?


395
00:21:28.702 --> 00:21:30.452
Same old, same old.

396
00:21:30.452 --> 00:21:32.494
You know, the show kept me
pretty busy, so...


397
00:21:32.494 --> 00:21:36.535
So is there a someone special
we should know about?


398
00:21:36.869 --> 00:21:39.327
- Come on now.
- What?


399
00:21:39.327 --> 00:21:42.161
Unfortunately, nothing to
report in that department.


400
00:21:42.161 --> 00:21:44.286
Well, that's perfectly
fine, sweetie.


401
00:21:44.286 --> 00:21:47.452
If there's anything I've
learned, you cannot rush love.


402
00:21:47.452 --> 00:21:51.994
Says the guy who proposed
to me on our fourth date


403
00:21:51.994 --> 00:21:53.827
in his own restaurant.

404
00:21:53.827 --> 00:21:56.577
What can I say?
I'm, um...


405
00:21:56.577 --> 00:21:58.327
just a bit of a romantic.

406
00:21:59.744 --> 00:22:01.744
Speaking of the restaurant,

407
00:22:01.744 --> 00:22:03.702
you are short a chef.

408
00:22:03.702 --> 00:22:06.244
And I would like to help.

409
00:22:06.244 --> 00:22:07.203
Well...

410
00:22:07.203 --> 00:22:10.119
That's very nice of you,
but uh,


411
00:22:10.119 --> 00:22:12.327
it's totally unnecessary.

412
00:22:12.327 --> 00:22:14.078
Dad, you're in no condition
to be in the kitchen.


413
00:22:14.078 --> 00:22:16.494
Please. I insist.

414
00:22:17.869 --> 00:22:20.452
Glenn, you should tell her.

415
00:22:20.452 --> 00:22:21.702
Tell me what?

416
00:22:21.702 --> 00:22:22.994
Nothing. Nothing.

417
00:22:22.994 --> 00:22:25.827
- Dad.
- Glenn...


418
00:22:25.827 --> 00:22:28.161
Dad, what's going on?

419
00:22:28.161 --> 00:22:33.369
Well, running a restaurant
is really hard work.


420
00:22:33.827 --> 00:22:36.285
Especially these days. It's--

421
00:22:36.285 --> 00:22:39.786
Yeah, I mean, right.
Honestly, what do we know about,


422
00:22:39.786 --> 00:22:43.994
about serving vegan pumpkin pate

423
00:22:43.994 --> 00:22:47.953
or why people want
deconstructed avocado toast?


424
00:22:47.953 --> 00:22:50.786
I mean, all that is,
is avocado on toast.


425
00:22:50.786 --> 00:22:54.535
You know, how much more
deconstructed can you get,


426
00:22:54.535 --> 00:22:57.327
right? And then, of course,
then there's this activated


427
00:22:57.327 --> 00:22:59.285
- charcoal that--
- Okay, honey.


428
00:22:59.285 --> 00:23:02.661
- I think you've started to go--
- Yeah, I knew--


429
00:23:02.661 --> 00:23:04.494
I just found out a couple
of weeks ago that your mother


430
00:23:04.494 --> 00:23:08.369
is in ketosis, okay? And she
doesn't say very much about it,


431
00:23:08.369 --> 00:23:10.161
but I think it could
turn very serious.


432
00:23:10.161 --> 00:23:12.494
And then I won't know what to do
'cause I'll be by myself.


433
00:23:12.494 --> 00:23:14.744
What's going on?

434
00:23:15.661 --> 00:23:19.036
Glenn, just tell her.

435
00:23:26.452 --> 00:23:28.369
Your mother and I want
to sell the restaurant.


436
00:23:40.869 --> 00:23:42.285
Mind if I join you?

437
00:23:45.494 --> 00:23:47.661
- Hi.
- Hi.


438
00:23:47.661 --> 00:23:50.244
I just don't understand. How
could you sell the restaurant


439
00:23:50.244 --> 00:23:53.285
like it doesn't mean anything?

440
00:23:53.285 --> 00:23:56.410
Well, I think we both
know better than that.


441
00:23:56.410 --> 00:23:58.202
Well, that's what it feels like.

442
00:23:58.202 --> 00:24:02.410
Trust me, this was not an
easy choice for either of us.


443
00:24:04.244 --> 00:24:08.869
But after Grandma CC
passed away, your dad, his--


444
00:24:08.869 --> 00:24:12.078
His heart just
hasn't been in it.


445
00:24:12.078 --> 00:24:13.994
But everything he
makes is so good.


446
00:24:13.994 --> 00:24:17.161
I know, sweetie. It is good,

447
00:24:17.161 --> 00:24:20.494
but good just doesn't
cut it nowadays.


448
00:24:20.494 --> 00:24:24.661
Well, how am I just now
finding out about this?


449
00:24:24.661 --> 00:24:27.577
You know how your father can be.

450
00:24:27.577 --> 00:24:30.869
He's a very proud man.

451
00:24:30.869 --> 00:24:34.119
Some might call it stubborn.

452
00:24:34.786 --> 00:24:36.536
Yeah.

453
00:24:38.994 --> 00:24:41.202
So are you gonna go
to Jordan's party?


454
00:24:41.202 --> 00:24:42.911
How do you know about that?

455
00:24:42.911 --> 00:24:44.619
We were supposed to cater it.

456
00:24:44.619 --> 00:24:48.036
That's why Jacob
dropped off the order.


457
00:24:48.744 --> 00:24:51.036
It would mean a lot to him.

458
00:24:52.327 --> 00:24:54.828
I don't know.
I'm not really in the mood.


459
00:24:54.828 --> 00:24:56.494
It's your vacation.

460
00:24:56.494 --> 00:24:59.244
Have some fun.

461
00:24:59.244 --> 00:25:01.452
You haven't seen your friends
in a long time.


462
00:25:01.452 --> 00:25:02.994
It would be nice
to see everybody.


463
00:25:02.994 --> 00:25:06.702
Yeah. Go.
You should go.

Thank you!
What are you doing here?


474
00:26:00.452 --> 00:26:02.911
Oh, Jacob invited me.
I hope that's okay.


475
00:26:02.911 --> 00:26:05.828
No. I meant what are you
doing in town?


476
00:26:05.828 --> 00:26:08.244
I finally
got some time off.

I love it.
Tom, get over here!

Look who it is.

- Wait, are you two?
- Yes, we are.


484
00:26:30.035 --> 00:26:33.119
Jordan finally worked up
the nerve to ask me out.


485
00:26:33.119 --> 00:26:34.327
It's about time.

486
00:26:34.327 --> 00:26:36.869
Yeah, don't get him started.

490
00:26:42.452 --> 00:26:45.327
Tom and I connected at a
salsa class a while back.


491
00:26:45.327 --> 00:26:49.327

00:26:52.994 --> 00:26:55.703
I'm far from famous.
I just cook a little on TV.


494

You made it.
I wasn't sure you'd come.


505
00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:18.786
Yeah, I wasn't sure
I was gonna come either.

Is everything okay?

508
00:27:23.411 --> 00:27:26.202
I just found out my parents
are selling the restaurant.


509
00:27:26.202 --> 00:27:28.828
Yeah, we're all really sorry
to hear about them closing.


510
00:27:28.828 --> 00:27:30.285

511

Yeah, Jacob.
Go have a drink.


516
00:27:44.786 --> 00:27:47.077

right now, Taylor.

- You lied to me.
- I never lied.

You knew about my
parents' restaurant


534
00:28:28.411 --> 00:28:30.828
and you didn't say anything.
You should have told me.

00:28:30.828 --> 00:28:32.828
It wasn't my place
to say anything.

I still have two good legs.


628
00:33:02.827 --> 00:33:04.827
Start me off
with a cup of coffee.


629
00:33:04.827 --> 00:33:06.494
Done.

630
00:33:14.119 --> 00:33:15.869
Why don't I make
that two coffees?


631
00:33:15.869 --> 00:33:17.536
Please.

632
00:33:17.536 --> 00:33:19.702
And you know what? I'll let
Linda know you're here.


633
00:33:19.702 --> 00:33:21.369
Great...

634
00:33:26.077 --> 00:33:28.494
- Hi.
- Hi.


635
00:33:28.494 --> 00:33:32.244
I was sitting over there.
I saw you guys come in.


636
00:33:32.578 --> 00:33:36.202
- What are you doing here?
- I eat here all the time.


637
00:33:36.202 --> 00:33:39.369
Of course you do.

638
00:33:39.369 --> 00:33:42.702
- Listen, about last night.
- Yeah, about that.


639
00:33:42.702 --> 00:33:47.869
I-I wanted to apologize.
Look, the past is the past,


640
00:33:47.869 --> 00:33:51.036
and there's no reason that
you and I can't be friends.


641
00:33:51.036 --> 00:33:53.952
- Agreed?
- Agreed.


642
00:33:54.369 --> 00:33:56.161
I said some things
I shouldn't have.


643
00:33:56.161 --> 00:33:58.660
I was upset.
And I took it out on you.


644
00:33:58.660 --> 00:34:00.328
I'm sorry.

645
00:34:00.328 --> 00:34:03.827
I'm sorry, too.

646
00:34:04.577 --> 00:34:07.994
Truce?

647
00:34:07.994 --> 00:34:09.494
Truce.

648
00:34:10.244 --> 00:34:13.494
So uh, when do you head back?

649
00:34:13.494 --> 00:34:15.494
Actually, I decided to stay
for a while.


650
00:34:15.494 --> 00:34:17.369
Help my parents
with the restaurant.


651
00:34:17.369 --> 00:34:20.077
My dad's injury really put
a damper on the renovations.


652
00:34:20.077 --> 00:34:23.036
Oh, well, I'm sure
they appreciate that.


653
00:34:23.036 --> 00:34:25.036
- How can I help?
- You don't have to help.


654
00:34:25.036 --> 00:34:26.869
I know.
But I want to.


655
00:34:26.869 --> 00:34:28.702
You're not the only one
who's gonna be sad about this.


656
00:34:28.702 --> 00:34:31.244
- Jacob.
- Glenn.


657
00:34:31.244 --> 00:34:33.036
- How are you?
- Good. Good to see you.


658
00:34:33.036 --> 00:34:33.911
You, too.
You look great.


659
00:34:33.911 --> 00:34:35.369
What have you been doing?

660
00:34:35.369 --> 00:34:38.202
Oh, uh, Patty's dragging me
to this Pilates class


661
00:34:38.202 --> 00:34:40.328
three times a week.

662
00:34:40.328 --> 00:34:42.660
- Maybe I should get into that.
- No.


663
00:34:42.660 --> 00:34:45.660
By the way, Taylor has asked
if I can come by and help out


664
00:34:45.660 --> 00:34:48.744
at the restaurant, and I would
be more than happy to.


665
00:34:48.744 --> 00:34:50.577
Oh, that's great.
The more the merrier.


666
00:34:50.577 --> 00:34:52.369
Why don't you stay and join us?

667
00:34:52.369 --> 00:34:53.869
You know, I'd love to,
but I actually just ate


668
00:34:53.869 --> 00:34:55.369
and I gotta run.

669
00:34:55.369 --> 00:34:57.244
But, uh, I'll stop by
the restaurant later.


670
00:34:58.827 --> 00:35:01.119
If you need anything,
just let me know.


671
00:35:01.119 --> 00:35:03.869
I will, helper.

672
00:35:03.869 --> 00:35:05.619
- All right. Bye.
- Bye.


673
00:35:06.785 --> 00:35:09.203
Well, that was an
unexpected pleasure.


674
00:35:09.203 --> 00:35:10.952
Yes, it was.

675
00:35:10.952 --> 00:35:12.328
Did you find your phone?

676
00:35:12.328 --> 00:35:13.827
Yeah. It's exactly
where I thought--


677
00:35:13.827 --> 00:35:16.369
Hello, Taylor.
Mr. Rider.


678
00:35:16.369 --> 00:35:19.077
We are so glad to see
you're doing better.


679
00:35:19.077 --> 00:35:21.161
You know, you gave us all
quite a scare.


680
00:35:21.161 --> 00:35:24.827
Well, small town news tends
to be a bit dramatic at times.


681
00:35:24.827 --> 00:35:28.994
Yes, well, that's part
of the charm, I suppose.


682
00:35:28.994 --> 00:35:32.077
By the way, I haven't gotten a
chance to thank you personally


683
00:35:32.077 --> 00:35:34.244
for passing along
the catering business.


684
00:35:34.244 --> 00:35:36.244
My mom and I really do
appreciate it.


685
00:35:36.244 --> 00:35:38.203
Well, I'm really glad
that worked out.


686
00:35:38.203 --> 00:35:40.744
Oh, Jordan was very happy.

687
00:35:42.660 --> 00:35:46.702
By the way, you two must be
excited about the competition.


688
00:35:46.702 --> 00:35:49.619
- What competition?
- Taylor didn't tell you?


689
00:35:58.411 --> 00:36:01.619
You're back in town one day and
already you made the front page.


690
00:36:06.161 --> 00:36:08.869
Anyways, may the best
restaurant win.


691
00:36:10.577 --> 00:36:11.869
I'll send over a server
to take your order.


692
00:36:11.869 --> 00:36:14.619
Thank you.
Taylor...


693
00:36:14.619 --> 00:36:17.702
I might have entered us
in the cook-off.


694
00:36:17.702 --> 00:36:20.244
Us? Who is us?

695
00:36:20.244 --> 00:36:21.786
Look, I'm selling the
restaurant.


696
00:36:21.786 --> 00:36:23.952
- I don't have time for this.
- Dad, I can tell you're upset,


697
00:36:23.952 --> 00:36:25.994
but look at the bright side.

698
00:36:25.994 --> 00:36:28.328
What is the bright side?

699
00:36:28.328 --> 00:36:31.702
Jessica says any publicity
is good publicity, right?


700
00:36:31.702 --> 00:36:34.660
Oh, and think about it this way.
Sea Sea Rider's crowned


701
00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:37.702
Food and Wine Festival champion.
Not a bad selling point.


702
00:36:37.702 --> 00:36:39.452
- Sure, but if I'm not--
- If we're gonna go out,


703
00:36:39.452 --> 00:36:41.869
let's go out with a bang.

704
00:36:41.869 --> 00:36:47.286
Plus, I can think of no better
way to spend my down time


705
00:36:47.286 --> 00:36:51.244
than cooking with my dad
like we used to.


706
00:36:54.203 --> 00:36:56.619
- Did it get me off the hook?
- Yes.


707
00:36:59.119 --> 00:37:01.619
So you are competing?

708
00:37:01.619 --> 00:37:04.660
Yes. Well,
technically, the restaurant is.


709
00:37:04.660 --> 00:37:06.660
But you just said your parents
were selling the restaurant.


710
00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:09.078
Isn't that the whole
reason you're staying?


711
00:37:09.078 --> 00:37:12.328
They are.
And it is.


712
00:37:12.328 --> 00:37:15.702
Is this about the restaurant
or Linda?


713
00:37:15.702 --> 00:37:18.494
Both.

714
00:37:18.494 --> 00:37:20.494
I mean, if I can get my dad
to fall back in love


715
00:37:20.494 --> 00:37:21.660
with cooking
by winning the contest,


716
00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:24.619
then maybe I can
save the restaurant.


717
00:37:24.619 --> 00:37:26.119
And you can shut
this Linda Box girl up


718
00:37:26.119 --> 00:37:27.161
once and for all.

719
00:37:27.161 --> 00:37:30.452
Exactly!

720
00:37:30.452 --> 00:37:33.702
The only thing I haven't
figured out yet is the money.


721
00:37:33.702 --> 00:37:39.244
Can I make a suggestion as
your friend and not your agent?


722
00:37:39.244 --> 00:37:40.827
Of course.

723
00:37:40.827 --> 00:37:43.702
With the salary the
network is offering,


724
00:37:43.702 --> 00:37:47.702
you could cover the cost of
reopening without hesitation.


725
00:37:47.702 --> 00:37:49.869
Is it really that much?

726
00:37:49.869 --> 00:37:51.869
Check your texts.

727
00:37:57.702 --> 00:37:59.203
You're kidding?

728
00:37:59.203 --> 00:38:02.410
Nope. And I can get you more
if you let me try.


729
00:38:02.410 --> 00:38:05.369
I don't know.
Money isn't everything.


730
00:38:05.369 --> 00:38:07.660
Look, if you don't like
what they come back with,


731
00:38:07.660 --> 00:38:11.869
then nothing changes.
There's no harm in flirting.


732
00:38:11.869 --> 00:38:14.327
Famous last words.

733
00:38:20.619 --> 00:38:23.744
What is this?
Foccacia is not gonna work.


734
00:38:24.702 --> 00:38:27.744
- So where were we?
- Recipes, recipes, recipes.


735
00:38:27.744 --> 00:38:29.452
Yes. Oh, can you hand me
the ones you put over there?


736
00:38:29.452 --> 00:38:32.327
Look who I found
wandering around outside.


737
00:38:32.327 --> 00:38:35.078
He said he's here
looking for work.


738
00:38:35.078 --> 00:38:36.369
I am at your disposal.

739
00:38:36.369 --> 00:38:38.119
Oh.

740
00:38:39.661 --> 00:38:42.244
What is going on in here?

741
00:38:42.244 --> 00:38:46.078
Surprise. We decided to enter
the annual cooking contest.


742
00:38:46.078 --> 00:38:48.036
We did, did we?

743
00:38:48.036 --> 00:38:51.327
Not me, I didn't...

744
00:38:51.327 --> 00:38:53.911
It was a--
Anyway.


745
00:38:53.911 --> 00:38:55.452
Well, I guess it's a good thing
I got Prince Charming here


746
00:38:55.452 --> 00:38:57.410
to pick up the slack.

747
00:38:57.410 --> 00:38:58.619
Well, what are you
guys gonna make?


748
00:38:58.619 --> 00:39:00.410
We are just starting
to figure that out.


749
00:39:00.410 --> 00:39:02.452
- Yeah...
- Okay!


750
00:39:03.494 --> 00:39:05.410
- Have fun, kids.
- Thank you, my darling.


751
00:39:05.744 --> 00:39:08.161
- You follow me.
- All right.


752
00:39:08.161 --> 00:39:10.078
I'm gonna go and help her out.

753
00:39:15.078 --> 00:39:17.369
You know, what we really need
to do is just make something


754
00:39:17.369 --> 00:39:19.327
to get our juices flowing,
you know?


755
00:39:19.327 --> 00:39:21.619
That's a great idea.
Dessert or entree?


756
00:39:21.619 --> 00:39:23.994
I have a sweet tooth, so--

757
00:39:23.994 --> 00:39:25.535
We should do dessert.

758
00:39:25.535 --> 00:39:26.744
Mm-hmm, yeah.

759
00:39:26.744 --> 00:39:29.078
Let's see.

760
00:39:30.203 --> 00:39:31.994
I have just the thing.

761
00:39:31.994 --> 00:39:33.786
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.


762
00:39:36.078 --> 00:39:38.203
So that's Baked Alaskan Flambé?

763
00:39:38.203 --> 00:39:41.369
Not quite yet.

764
00:39:41.369 --> 00:39:44.078
We used to do this all the time
at the restaurant in New York.


765
00:39:44.078 --> 00:39:45.953
Yeah?

766
00:39:47.577 --> 00:39:49.994
- Now for the fun part.
- Oof!


767
00:39:49.994 --> 00:39:51.535
- You ready?
- Yeah.


768
00:39:52.827 --> 00:39:54.078
- Whoa!
- Whoa!


769
00:39:55.661 --> 00:39:57.786
Oh, I forgot the cinnamon.

770
00:39:58.119 --> 00:39:59.702
It's in the back pantry.

771
00:39:59.702 --> 00:40:01.577
Where in the pantry?

772
00:40:01.577 --> 00:40:03.911
No, forget it. I think
I got some up here.


773
00:40:03.911 --> 00:40:04.911
What?

774
00:40:04.911 --> 00:40:06.452
I've got some up here.

775
00:40:06.953 --> 00:40:08.203
Whoa! Fire!

776
00:40:08.203 --> 00:40:09.911
Jacob!

777
00:40:12.410 --> 00:40:14.369
It's supposed to be on fire.

778
00:40:14.661 --> 00:40:17.369
Glenn,
I am so sorry.


779
00:40:18.202 --> 00:40:20.869
I guess I have kitchen duty
for the rest of my life.


780
00:40:20.869 --> 00:40:22.452
Probably.

781
00:40:23.661 --> 00:40:25.202
Oh...

782
00:40:25.202 --> 00:40:26.661
What happened?

783
00:40:26.661 --> 00:40:28.244
My fireman training kicked in.

784
00:40:28.244 --> 00:40:29.953
You were a Boy Scout.

785
00:40:29.953 --> 00:40:33.410
The scouts take fire
very seriously.


786
00:40:33.410 --> 00:40:36.285
I gotta clean up
very seriously.


787
00:40:36.285 --> 00:40:38.911
Oh, Dad.

788
00:40:38.911 --> 00:40:41.577
Oh, my goodness.
Can I help you make another one?


789
00:40:41.577 --> 00:40:43.786
Oh, no, no.
We're calling it quits.


790
00:40:43.786 --> 00:40:46.244
Plus you, you have a lot of
cleaning up to do.


791
00:40:46.244 --> 00:40:47.744
Yes, I do.

792
00:40:47.744 --> 00:40:52.119
When we're all clean,
do you want to take a walk?


793
00:40:52.119 --> 00:40:53.577
Yeah, that sounds great.

794
00:40:53.577 --> 00:40:55.452
Where are you thinking?

795
00:40:57.119 --> 00:41:00.327
So what's new with you?
Are you happy at the farm?


796
00:41:00.327 --> 00:41:03.119
You know what?
I really am.


797
00:41:03.119 --> 00:41:04.202
You know, there's something
right about waking up


798
00:41:04.202 --> 00:41:05.619
with the sun,

799
00:41:05.619 --> 00:41:07.452
watching everything
grow around me,


800
00:41:07.452 --> 00:41:09.744
staying connected
to the community.


801
00:41:09.744 --> 00:41:14.410
I mean, I know it sounds simple,
but I really enjoy it.


802
00:41:14.410 --> 00:41:15.911
Simple sounds nice.

803
00:41:17.202 --> 00:41:18.953
What?

804
00:41:18.953 --> 00:41:22.911
Oh, nothing. Just something I
never thought I'd hear you say.


805
00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:27.452
With you, it was always
Paris this and New York that.


806
00:41:27.452 --> 00:41:29.452
Everything was always
so grandiose.


807
00:41:29.452 --> 00:41:31.244
Nothing seemed simple.

808
00:41:31.244 --> 00:41:34.160
Yeah, that sounds like me.

809
00:41:35.036 --> 00:41:36.577
So what's going on
with you and dating?


810
00:41:36.577 --> 00:41:39.244
I heard you and Linda
were a thing.


811
00:41:39.244 --> 00:41:42.661
Well, we could chalk that up to
a temporary lapse in judgment.


812
00:41:42.661 --> 00:41:44.911
But she's so charming.

813
00:41:44.911 --> 00:41:47.536
I know, I know.

814
00:41:47.536 --> 00:41:49.452
Yeah, I've had a few girlfriends
here and there.


815
00:41:49.452 --> 00:41:52.410
Nothing that really stuck,
you know?


816
00:41:52.410 --> 00:41:55.744
I don't know. I guess,
just not ready to settle.


817
00:41:55.744 --> 00:41:58.911
Figure the right one
will come along eventually.


818
00:42:01.953 --> 00:42:04.828
What about you?
You seeing anyone?


819
00:42:04.828 --> 00:42:06.702
No.

820
00:42:06.702 --> 00:42:08.994
I guess you could say
I'm married to my career.


821
00:42:08.994 --> 00:42:11.494
There's the Taylor I know.

822
00:42:12.410 --> 00:42:14.911
I miss this.

823
00:42:14.911 --> 00:42:17.410
Yeah, I remember we used to
come out here for hours on end.


824
00:42:17.410 --> 00:42:20.577
Just two kids dreaming
about the future.


825
00:42:21.077 --> 00:42:23.744
It looks like all your
dreams came true.


826
00:42:23.744 --> 00:42:25.661
Yeah, I don't know about that.

827
00:42:25.661 --> 00:42:27.786
But I thought you said they're
moving your show to primetime.


828
00:42:27.786 --> 00:42:29.202
They are.

829
00:42:29.202 --> 00:42:32.160
I just haven't accepted
their offer to host it yet.


830
00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:34.786
What's stopping you?

831
00:42:34.786 --> 00:42:36.744
All I wanted to do was be
a great chef


832
00:42:36.744 --> 00:42:39.036
and teach people
how to make amazing food.


833
00:42:39.036 --> 00:42:43.994
But on QED, all I do is make
dips and finger foods.


834
00:42:43.994 --> 00:42:45.327
So why don't you change it

835
00:42:45.327 --> 00:42:46.619
and offer the audience
something different?


836
00:42:46.619 --> 00:42:48.452
Believe me, I would love to.

837
00:42:48.452 --> 00:42:50.160
But changing the format
of a successful show


838
00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:54.744
is harder than you think,
even if you are the host.


839
00:42:54.744 --> 00:42:58.327
Well, then maybe it's
just not right for you.


840
00:42:58.327 --> 00:43:01.619
Maybe. Or maybe I'm
just being too picky.


841
00:43:01.619 --> 00:43:02.911
No.

842
00:43:02.911 --> 00:43:04.911
I don't think you're
being picky at all.


843
00:43:08.119 --> 00:43:09.411
What are you doing?

844
00:43:09.411 --> 00:43:11.994
You're more than
welcome to join.


845
00:43:11.994 --> 00:43:15.077
In my clothes?
I don't have a bathing suit.


846
00:43:15.077 --> 00:43:17.577
What? Are you afraid to get your
little fancy clothes wet?


847
00:43:19.411 --> 00:43:21.285
Come on!
It's gonna feel great!


848
00:43:45.953 --> 00:43:46.828
Come in.

849
00:43:48.994 --> 00:43:51.077
You need anything before
we turn in for the night?


850
00:43:51.077 --> 00:43:53.452
No, I'm good. Thank you.

851
00:43:54.285 --> 00:43:55.869
You know, it was really good

852
00:43:55.869 --> 00:43:58.911
to see you two
cooking together again.


853
00:44:01.202 --> 00:44:02.119
Goodnight, sweetheart.

854
00:44:02.119 --> 00:44:03.911
Night, Mom.

855
00:44:17.994 --> 00:44:19.411
And done.

856
00:44:20.119 --> 00:44:22.661
We really appreciate you
helping us out like this.


857
00:44:22.661 --> 00:44:24.411
Of course.

858
00:44:24.411 --> 00:44:26.703
You know, I'm a little surprised
you or Glenn didn't ask sooner.


859
00:44:28.327 --> 00:44:30.619
We know how busy you are.

860
00:44:30.619 --> 00:44:33.286
We didn't want to be a bother,
so...


861
00:44:33.286 --> 00:44:35.869
Are you kidding?

862
00:44:35.869 --> 00:44:38.619
You know, when my mom passed,

863
00:44:38.619 --> 00:44:39.786
it was hard on all of us,

864
00:44:39.786 --> 00:44:41.494
- especially my pops.
- Yeah.


865
00:44:41.494 --> 00:44:45.119
But you, Glenn, Grandma CC,

866
00:44:45.119 --> 00:44:48.286
you guys always made it a point
to make me feel like family.


867
00:44:48.286 --> 00:44:51.786
And I will never forget that.

868
00:44:53.286 --> 00:44:55.661
That's because you are.

869
00:44:57.202 --> 00:44:58.494
Lunch is ready.

870
00:44:58.494 --> 00:44:59.994
Finally.

871
00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:06.119
Here we are.

872
00:45:06.119 --> 00:45:07.452
What have we got?

873
00:45:07.452 --> 00:45:10.286
We have a toasted crostini
with chicken liver paté,


874
00:45:10.286 --> 00:45:14.119
arugula, heirloom tomato,
finished with a balsamic glaze.


875
00:45:14.119 --> 00:45:15.828
Ooh.

876
00:45:15.828 --> 00:45:18.035
- Hey.
- Enjoy.


877
00:45:19.994 --> 00:45:21.661
Mmm.

878
00:45:23.619 --> 00:45:25.369
Interesting.

879
00:45:25.369 --> 00:45:27.327
But?

880
00:45:27.327 --> 00:45:29.661
I'm just not sure this

881
00:45:29.661 --> 00:45:32.452
is the right dish
for the competition.


882
00:45:32.452 --> 00:45:34.910
So you're a chef now?

883
00:45:34.910 --> 00:45:39.369
No, no, I'm probably wrong.
Completely wrong, probably.


884
00:45:40.536 --> 00:45:41.910
What do you think, Dad?

885
00:45:41.910 --> 00:45:44.661
I kind of agree with Jacob.

886
00:45:46.494 --> 00:45:48.369
Well, shoot.

887
00:45:48.869 --> 00:45:51.786
Well, what if we go to the farm?
Maybe I'll get an idea.


888
00:45:51.786 --> 00:45:54.703
Well, I'm a little tired,
so why don't you go on ahead


889
00:45:54.703 --> 00:45:56.744
and your mother and I
will lock up?


890
00:45:56.744 --> 00:45:59.452
- I rode with you.
- Well, I can drive you.


891
00:45:59.452 --> 00:46:00.661
You sure?

892
00:46:00.661 --> 00:46:02.786
Yeah, absolutely.

893
00:46:43.411 --> 00:46:45.619
Whoa, this place
has really changed.


894
00:46:45.619 --> 00:46:48.286
Everything is organic
or locally sourced.


895
00:46:48.286 --> 00:46:51.910
It's almost impossible to find
vegetables as fresh in the city.


896
00:46:51.910 --> 00:46:54.286
Here, these just went in season.

897
00:46:54.286 --> 00:46:56.161
Try one.

898
00:46:57.494 --> 00:47:01.077
Mmm.
I could use these somehow.


899
00:47:01.077 --> 00:47:02.994
Well, if you want, we can
have some freshly picked


900
00:47:02.994 --> 00:47:05.619
and delivered to you tomorrow,
if you like.


901
00:47:05.619 --> 00:47:07.035
- Yeah, that'll be great.
- Okay.


902
00:47:08.035 --> 00:47:10.119
Hey Jacob.

903
00:47:10.119 --> 00:47:11.119
Hey, Linda.

904
00:47:11.119 --> 00:47:12.952
Taylor.

905
00:47:12.952 --> 00:47:14.244
Hi, Linda.

906
00:47:14.244 --> 00:47:16.536
It's funny seeing
the two of you here.


907
00:47:16.536 --> 00:47:18.035
How's it going?

908
00:47:18.035 --> 00:47:20.411
You know me, just picking out
some fresh produce


909
00:47:20.411 --> 00:47:22.119
before the competition.

910
00:47:22.119 --> 00:47:23.785
Oh, great.

911
00:47:23.785 --> 00:47:25.661
And just so you know,

912
00:47:25.661 --> 00:47:29.785
my dishes may not be quick
or easy,


913
00:47:29.785 --> 00:47:32.286
but they will be delicious.

914
00:47:35.369 --> 00:47:37.744
Well, I guess we'll have to see.

915
00:47:37.744 --> 00:47:41.744
True.
We'll see you later, Jacob.


916
00:47:41.994 --> 00:47:44.035
Bye.

917
00:47:46.661 --> 00:47:48.827
Do you want a shake?
My treat.


918
00:47:48.827 --> 00:47:50.244
Yes.

919
00:47:51.661 --> 00:47:53.744
- No, that's Bora and Brody.
- Here you go.


920
00:47:53.744 --> 00:47:54.744
Two blueberries.

921
00:47:54.744 --> 00:47:55.619
- Thank you.
- Thank you.


922
00:47:55.619 --> 00:47:57.161
Here you go.

923
00:47:57.161 --> 00:47:58.619
Oh, but, sir,
you didn't have to--


924
00:47:58.619 --> 00:48:00.119
That's all right.
Keep the change.


925
00:48:00.119 --> 00:48:02.119
Thanks, Mr. D.

926
00:48:02.119 --> 00:48:03.202
You're welcome.

927
00:48:03.202 --> 00:48:04.785
Sir? Mr. D?

928
00:48:04.785 --> 00:48:07.286
She's a formal girl.

929
00:48:07.286 --> 00:48:09.119
Cheers.

930
00:48:10.827 --> 00:48:14.744
This brings back such memories.
Do you remember


931
00:48:14.744 --> 00:48:17.785
you used to dip your
fried chicken into ice cream?


932
00:48:17.785 --> 00:48:20.161
Would you think I'm weird
if I told you I still do?


933
00:48:20.161 --> 00:48:22.453
Yeah.

934
00:48:22.453 --> 00:48:25.119
I get it, though. It's like
French fries and milkshakes.


935
00:48:25.119 --> 00:48:26.494
Sweet and salty.

936
00:48:26.494 --> 00:48:28.494
Yes, that is exactly what
I've always been saying.


937
00:48:28.494 --> 00:48:30.077
I'll give you this one.

938
00:48:30.077 --> 00:48:31.661
All right, well, do you remember
when you used to make


939
00:48:31.661 --> 00:48:32.869
those pickle cheese sandwiches?

940
00:48:32.869 --> 00:48:34.327
Yes, but those were
actually good.


941
00:48:34.327 --> 00:48:35.869
Said nobody ever.

942
00:48:35.869 --> 00:48:38.661
Then why did you have
me keep making them for you?


943
00:48:38.661 --> 00:48:41.744
Well, it was a good excuse
to keep you around.


944
00:48:42.702 --> 00:48:45.453
Look at you being all cute
right now.


945
00:48:45.453 --> 00:48:49.411
What can I say? You, uh...
You have that effect on me.


946
00:48:55.910 --> 00:48:57.077
We should probably get going.

947
00:48:57.077 --> 00:48:59.494
Yeah, of course.

948
00:49:08.952 --> 00:49:11.036
Right now, oh, here they come.
Here they come.


949
00:49:18.453 --> 00:49:20.036
Jessica!

950
00:49:20.036 --> 00:49:21.119
Let me take this for you, sweetie.

951
00:49:21.119 --> 00:49:22.994
Oh, thanks, Mom.

952
00:49:22.994 --> 00:49:25.785
- Hi!
- Hello!


953
00:49:25.785 --> 00:49:27.244
What are you doing here?

954
00:49:27.244 --> 00:49:29.660
Well, I mean, all your talk of
food competitions,


955
00:49:29.660 --> 00:49:31.619
I felt like I was missing out.

956
00:49:31.619 --> 00:49:32.785
Really?

957
00:49:32.785 --> 00:49:34.744
No.

958
00:49:34.744 --> 00:49:36.411
Your contract came back
from the network,


959
00:49:36.411 --> 00:49:38.286
and rather than send it to you
and have you sit on it


960
00:49:38.286 --> 00:49:39.785
for who knows how long,

961
00:49:39.785 --> 00:49:42.286
I thought I'd deliver it to you
in person.


962
00:49:42.286 --> 00:49:43.952
Is it really that good?

963
00:49:43.952 --> 00:49:46.161
Yes.

964
00:49:46.453 --> 00:49:48.077
I should, uh, I should be going.

965
00:49:48.077 --> 00:49:52.286
Oh, sorry, Jacob.
This is my agent, Jessica.


966
00:49:52.286 --> 00:49:53.578
Jessica, this is Jacob.

967
00:49:53.578 --> 00:49:54.952
The Jacob?

968
00:49:54.952 --> 00:49:56.620
That's me.

969
00:49:56.620 --> 00:49:58.369
I've heard your name
once or twice.


970
00:49:58.369 --> 00:50:00.077
Good things, I hope.

971
00:50:00.077 --> 00:50:03.119
- Mm-mm.
- Eh...


972
00:50:03.119 --> 00:50:04.411
It's really nice meeting you,
Jessica.


973
00:50:04.411 --> 00:50:06.077
Jacob.

974
00:50:06.077 --> 00:50:08.536
Well, I guess I better
get going then.


975
00:50:08.536 --> 00:50:09.328
- Thanks for the ride.
- Yeah.


976
00:50:09.328 --> 00:50:11.453
And for today.

977
00:50:11.453 --> 00:50:13.202
Yeah, it's no problem.
See you later?


978
00:50:13.202 --> 00:50:14.286
- Yes.
- All right.


979
00:50:14.286 --> 00:50:16.369
Okay.
Bye.


980
00:50:17.660 --> 00:50:21.161
"Thank you for the ride."
Oh, he is cute!


981
00:50:21.161 --> 00:50:23.286
- Do not even start!
- Oh, my God...


982
00:50:23.286 --> 00:50:25.077
"Thank you for today."

983
00:50:25.077 --> 00:50:26.785
Okay.

984
00:50:27.785 --> 00:50:29.411
Can I get you another slice?

985
00:50:29.411 --> 00:50:30.702
No, thank you.

986
00:50:30.702 --> 00:50:33.202
If I eat another bite,
I'll explode.


987
00:50:33.202 --> 00:50:35.286
This family tends to
do that to people.


988
00:50:35.286 --> 00:50:38.286
Seriously? Everything was
absolutely incredible.


989
00:50:38.286 --> 00:50:42.286
Jessica, Taylor told us all
the good news about the show.


990
00:50:42.286 --> 00:50:43.411
It's very exciting.

991
00:50:43.411 --> 00:50:45.119
Right?

992
00:50:45.119 --> 00:50:46.369
I mean, I still
can't believe it myself.


993
00:50:46.369 --> 00:50:49.785
Primetime at 8:00 pm.

994
00:50:49.785 --> 00:50:52.785
Primetime? Honey, you didn't
even mention that!


995
00:50:52.785 --> 00:50:54.952
Nothing is definite
till the contracts are signed.


996
00:50:54.952 --> 00:50:58.453
Oh, shush. Congratulations!
Sweetie, that's amazing!


997
00:50:58.453 --> 00:51:00.994
My daughter on primetime.

998
00:51:00.994 --> 00:51:02.869
Guys...

999
00:51:02.869 --> 00:51:04.536
I think we should throw
one of those watch parties.


1000
00:51:04.536 --> 00:51:05.994
Guys...

1001
00:51:05.994 --> 00:51:07.869
We're working out
some of the logistics, but--


1002
00:51:07.869 --> 00:51:09.619
Guys!

1003
00:51:09.619 --> 00:51:11.994
I haven't said yes yet.

1004
00:51:25.869 --> 00:51:29.744
I'm really sorry.
I assumed you told your parents.


1005
00:51:29.744 --> 00:51:32.036
- Rookie mistake.
- It's okay.


1006
00:51:32.036 --> 00:51:33.660
I just wasn't gonna tell them
until I made up my mind.


1007
00:51:33.660 --> 00:51:35.328
Well, have you?

1008
00:51:35.328 --> 00:51:37.244
I don't know
what I'm gonna do.


1009
00:51:37.244 --> 00:51:40.036
QED was never supposed to be
my entire career.


1010
00:51:40.036 --> 00:51:42.203
I want to be taken seriously.

1011
00:51:42.203 --> 00:51:45.577
I mean, can't get more serious
than primetime.


1012
00:51:45.577 --> 00:51:49.077
The more fans you have,
the more seriously you're taken.


1013
00:51:49.077 --> 00:51:51.827
As a personality or a chef?

1014
00:51:51.827 --> 00:51:53.535
As an icon.

1015
00:51:53.535 --> 00:51:56.411
Plus, they agreed to double
what they were already offering.


1016
00:51:56.411 --> 00:51:57.994
- Double?
- Yeah. I really played up


1017
00:51:57.994 --> 00:52:01.036
your concerns as being labeled
a one-trick pony.


1018
00:52:01.036 --> 00:52:02.702
What about the food?

1019
00:52:02.702 --> 00:52:05.744
Still quick, easy and delicious.

1020
00:52:11.411 --> 00:52:13.286
I loved growing up here.

1021
00:52:13.286 --> 00:52:14.744
This place definitely
has a charm to it.


1022
00:52:14.744 --> 00:52:16.535
I will give you that.

1023
00:52:17.911 --> 00:52:21.203
And this is the famous
Sea Sea Riders.


1024
00:52:21.203 --> 00:52:27.077
Oh, where a young Taylor
fell in love with cooking.


1025
00:52:27.077 --> 00:52:29.036
I can't even count the hours
I spent in that kitchen


1026
00:52:29.036 --> 00:52:32.411
watching my dad and grandma
create these amazing dishes.


1027
00:52:32.827 --> 00:52:35.369
Taylor!
Ooh, stop, stop, stop.


1028
00:52:35.369 --> 00:52:37.453
- Taylor!
- Hi!


1029
00:52:37.453 --> 00:52:38.660
- Hey.
- Jordan!


1030
00:52:38.660 --> 00:52:40.577
Awwww!

1031
00:52:40.577 --> 00:52:41.744
What are you doing here?

1032
00:52:41.744 --> 00:52:44.286
Oh, we're just out on the town.

1033
00:52:44.494 --> 00:52:48.952
Well, sorry, Jordan, Tom,
this is my agent, Jessica.


1034
00:52:48.952 --> 00:52:50.119
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.


1035
00:52:50.119 --> 00:52:51.702
My friend Jordan
and his boyfriend Tom.


1036
00:52:51.702 --> 00:52:54.244
Hi. Nice meeting you.
Valentinos?


1037
00:52:54.244 --> 00:52:56.244
- Stavali's.
- Italian?


1038
00:52:56.244 --> 00:52:58.660
Dunedin.
He's a local designer.


1039
00:52:58.660 --> 00:53:00.994
We went to high school together.

1040
00:53:00.994 --> 00:53:03.286
Speaking of Dunedin,
how do you like it so far?


1041
00:53:03.286 --> 00:53:05.911
It's starting to grow on me.

1042
00:53:05.911 --> 00:53:07.452
How long are you
gonna be in town?


1043
00:53:07.452 --> 00:53:09.203
Just for tonight.

1044
00:53:09.203 --> 00:53:11.077
Taylor and I have some things we
have to work out for the show.


1045
00:53:11.077 --> 00:53:14.911
Well, you know my vote.
Follow your heart.


1046
00:53:14.911 --> 00:53:17.994
But sometimes we have to
follow our brain as well.


1047
00:53:17.994 --> 00:53:19.911
But remember what Grandma CC
would always say,


1048
00:53:19.911 --> 00:53:22.535
"In a battle between
the mind and the heart,


1049
00:53:22.535 --> 00:53:24.244
let the heart win."

1050
00:53:24.244 --> 00:53:26.869
Mm-hmm, but sometimes
we have to let the brain win


1051
00:53:26.869 --> 00:53:28.660
because the heart
isn't always right.


1052
00:53:33.328 --> 00:53:36.161
Well, I'm sure we all have
things to do.


1053
00:53:36.161 --> 00:53:38.577
Yes. We're gonna go check out
downtown Dunedin.


1054
00:53:38.577 --> 00:53:40.869
Great. Good luck.

1055
00:53:40.869 --> 00:53:42.161
- Bye, guys.
- Bye, you guys.


1056
00:53:42.161 --> 00:53:43.952
Bye.

1057
00:53:45.786 --> 00:53:47.577
- Let's go see the kitchen.
- Let's do that.


1058
00:53:57.869 --> 00:54:01.161
So, Jacob,
I can tell he really likes you.


1059
00:54:01.161 --> 00:54:03.702
No, that's all in the past.
We're just friends.


1060
00:54:03.702 --> 00:54:05.619
Sure, but,

1061
00:54:05.619 --> 00:54:09.369
you know I want nothing
but the best for you, right?


1062
00:54:09.369 --> 00:54:11.410
Of course.

1063
00:54:11.410 --> 00:54:16.119
That being said, the network
wants a decision by tomorrow.


1064
00:54:16.994 --> 00:54:19.369
Mind if I sleep on it?

1065
00:54:19.369 --> 00:54:21.535
I work for you.

1066
00:54:21.535 --> 00:54:23.161
- Night.
- Night.


1067
00:54:37.535 --> 00:54:39.161
Hey, Dad.

1068
00:54:39.161 --> 00:54:42.244
Oh! Hey, you almost
gave me a heart attack.


1069
00:54:42.244 --> 00:54:44.286
Sorry.

1070
00:54:44.952 --> 00:54:46.286
What are you making?

1071
00:54:46.286 --> 00:54:48.410
Well, a little midnight snack.

1072
00:54:48.410 --> 00:54:49.869
It's 9:30.

1073
00:54:49.869 --> 00:54:52.869
Well, it's a

1074
00:54:52.869 --> 00:54:55.286
- You want half?
- Sure.


1075
00:54:59.535 --> 00:55:00.744
Oooh!

1076
00:55:00.744 --> 00:55:02.203
That looks delicious.

1077
00:55:02.203 --> 00:55:04.994
It is.
It is one of my best.


1078
00:55:05.994 --> 00:55:08.452
Ooh!

1079
00:55:08.452 --> 00:55:09.661
There we go.

1080
00:55:11.119 --> 00:55:13.410
- Aw.
- Here you go, angel.


1081
00:55:13.410 --> 00:55:14.911
Thanks, Dad.

1082
00:55:24.410 --> 00:55:26.369
You okay?

1083
00:55:28.786 --> 00:55:31.244
I just don't know what to do.

1084
00:55:31.244 --> 00:55:35.285
I have this amazing offer
staring me in the face.


1085
00:55:35.285 --> 00:55:38.577
And for some reason,
it just doesn't feel right.


1086
00:55:44.244 --> 00:55:46.203
Well, I'm gonna tell you
something that your grandmother


1087
00:55:46.203 --> 00:55:50.036
told me just before
I took over the restaurant.


1088
00:55:51.911 --> 00:55:55.994
She said,
"If you're gonna do something,


1089
00:55:55.994 --> 00:55:58.911
"you gotta do it
for the right reasons.


1090
00:56:00.078 --> 00:56:02.285
"Money comes and goes,

1091
00:56:05.452 --> 00:56:08.744
"but your love for food

1092
00:56:08.744 --> 00:56:10.911
"is what makes a great chef.

1093
00:56:12.911 --> 00:56:14.702
"Without that,

1094
00:56:14.702 --> 00:56:17.494
you're in the wrong business."

1095
00:56:17.827 --> 00:56:20.410
She said that?

1096
00:56:20.410 --> 00:56:22.661
She did.

1097
00:56:23.535 --> 00:56:26.244
I miss her all the time.

1098
00:56:26.244 --> 00:56:28.619
So do I.

1099
00:56:34.244 --> 00:56:36.619
She had this knack of putting
smiles on people's faces


1100
00:56:36.619 --> 00:56:38.953
with the food she made.

1101
00:56:40.535 --> 00:56:41.994
She loved that restaurant.

1102
00:56:43.410 --> 00:56:47.661
And everybody that came in there
and sat down,


1103
00:56:47.661 --> 00:56:50.203
they felt it.

1104
00:57:03.036 --> 00:57:05.161
I know you're going to
make the right choice.


1105
00:57:08.786 --> 00:57:11.369
Goodnight, my Junebug.

1106
00:57:11.369 --> 00:57:14.119
Goodnight, Dad.

1107
00:57:30.494 --> 00:57:33.161
- Good morning.
- Good morning.


1108
00:57:33.161 --> 00:57:36.244
Oh. How are the scones?

1109
00:57:36.244 --> 00:57:37.786
They're delicious.

1110
00:57:37.786 --> 00:57:39.702
- Right?
- Yes.


1111
00:57:40.410 --> 00:57:41.786
I wanted to talk to you
a minute.


1112
00:57:41.786 --> 00:57:43.828
Sure.

1113
00:57:43.828 --> 00:57:46.327
So I made my decision.

1114
00:57:46.327 --> 00:57:48.536
And?

1115
00:57:51.327 --> 00:57:53.494
I decided to do the show.

1116
00:57:53.494 --> 00:57:54.994
Really?

1117
00:57:54.994 --> 00:57:56.619
You seem surprised.

1118
00:57:56.619 --> 00:57:59.953
I felt like you were leaning
in the opposite direction.


1119
00:57:59.953 --> 00:58:02.494
Like you said, this is the
opportunity of a lifetime.


1120
00:58:02.494 --> 00:58:04.078
I'd be crazy to pass it up.

1121
00:58:04.078 --> 00:58:07.160
That sounds like me.
Always selling.


1122
00:58:07.410 --> 00:58:09.786
This is what needs to happen.

1123
00:58:09.786 --> 00:58:12.786
Your final answer?

1124
00:58:12.786 --> 00:58:14.911
Final answer.

1125
00:58:14.911 --> 00:58:17.160
Okay. I'll let the network know.

1126
00:58:17.160 --> 00:58:19.202
They're gonna want you
to start right away.


1127
00:58:19.202 --> 00:58:20.744
Can you buy me a week or so?

1128
00:58:20.744 --> 00:58:22.869
Oh yeah. I can manage that.

1129
00:58:22.869 --> 00:58:23.953
Thank you.

1130
00:58:23.953 --> 00:58:25.619
All right.

1131
00:58:25.619 --> 00:58:28.369
I gotta get back to Atlanta.
I have a lot of work to do.


1132
00:58:37.494 --> 00:58:40.536
Quick, easy.
Unoriginal.


1133
00:58:44.160 --> 00:58:45.953
- Hey.
- Hey.


1134
00:58:45.953 --> 00:58:47.160
Here we go.

1135
00:58:47.160 --> 00:58:49.327
Oh, thank you.

1136
00:58:49.327 --> 00:58:51.119
Mm.

1137
00:58:51.119 --> 00:58:52.828
Where's your pops?

1138
00:58:52.828 --> 00:58:53.953
He's at a doctor's appointment.

1139
00:58:53.953 --> 00:58:57.036
Okay. Ooh, mind if I try?

1140
00:58:57.036 --> 00:58:58.661
Please.

1141
00:59:00.119 --> 00:59:03.285
Let's see...

1142
00:59:04.369 --> 00:59:08.160
Mmm. Mmm. This is good.

1143
00:59:08.160 --> 00:59:10.702
This is basic.

1144
00:59:10.702 --> 00:59:13.411
Basically delicious.

1145
00:59:13.411 --> 00:59:15.619
Sorry. That was a little corny.

1146
00:59:16.702 --> 00:59:19.285
Get it? Cornbread.

1147
00:59:21.160 --> 00:59:23.244
None of this is
gonna win the contest.


1148
00:59:23.244 --> 00:59:25.786
- Nothing here is original.
- All right.


1149
00:59:25.786 --> 00:59:29.160
I think you're putting
way too much stress on yourself.


1150
00:59:29.160 --> 00:59:31.494
Maybe that's all I'm good at.

1151
00:59:31.494 --> 00:59:33.494
Quick and easy.

1152
00:59:33.494 --> 00:59:35.119
Okay.

1153
00:59:35.119 --> 00:59:36.744
I think you need
to take a break.


1154
00:59:36.744 --> 00:59:39.285
I would love to actually
take a break, but I can't.


1155
00:59:39.285 --> 00:59:41.953
- The competition is--
- Tomorrow. I know.


1156
00:59:41.953 --> 00:59:45.035
But sitting in here all day
cooking dish after basic dish


1157
00:59:45.035 --> 00:59:46.411
isn't gonna do anybody any good.

1158
00:59:46.411 --> 00:59:48.661
Ow.

1159
00:59:49.327 --> 00:59:52.160
You know what you need?

1160
00:59:52.160 --> 00:59:55.244
A little inspiration.

1161
01:00:07.077 --> 01:00:10.411
- What's this?
- Just trust me.


1162
01:00:11.369 --> 01:00:14.160
Big Mike,
four barbacoas, please.


1163
01:00:15.411 --> 01:00:17.369
All made from scratch.

1164
01:00:17.369 --> 01:00:19.077
How'd you find this place?

1165
01:00:19.077 --> 01:00:20.411
Well, they get all their produce
from the farm.


1166
01:00:20.411 --> 01:00:22.619
And get all their meats
from Alan, all local.


1167
01:00:22.619 --> 01:00:24.369
Huh.

1168
01:00:27.035 --> 01:00:28.786
Oh, wow.

1169
01:00:30.869 --> 01:00:32.411
Oh, that's amazing.

1170
01:00:32.411 --> 01:00:34.869
I promise. You haven't had
barbacoa like this.


1171
01:00:36.536 --> 01:00:40.869
I'm not saying you should
make this exact thing, but...


1172
01:00:41.703 --> 01:00:45.411
Oh, thank you. Wow.

1173
01:00:47.369 --> 01:00:48.369
Here, I'll take that.

1174
01:00:48.369 --> 01:00:50.035
- Oh, thanks.
- Sit over there.


1175
01:00:50.327 --> 01:00:52.244
- Thank you.
- Thanks.


1176
01:01:02.035 --> 01:01:05.452
- That was amazing.
- Right?


1177
01:01:05.452 --> 01:01:09.494
This recipe has been in his
family for generations.


1178
01:01:09.494 --> 01:01:12.786
I've never had barbacoa
this good.


1179
01:01:12.786 --> 01:01:15.661
For what it's worth,
I think maybe one of the reasons


1180
01:01:15.661 --> 01:01:18.244
you're having such
a hard time right now


1181
01:01:18.244 --> 01:01:21.577
is that what you're making

1182
01:01:21.577 --> 01:01:23.869
isn't yours.

1183
01:01:23.869 --> 01:01:26.160
And maybe what's missing is

1184
01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:28.035
a piece of you.

1185
01:01:32.703 --> 01:01:34.119
You know, we broke up.

1186
01:01:34.119 --> 01:01:36.452
I didn't know
what to do with myself.


1187
01:01:36.452 --> 01:01:40.911
I was broken hearted.
The only thing I had was work.


1188
01:01:40.911 --> 01:01:44.286
So I guess in a way,
I owe part of my career to you.


1189
01:01:45.828 --> 01:01:48.202
You're welcome?

1190
01:01:51.035 --> 01:01:53.452
I took the job.

1191
01:01:53.452 --> 01:01:56.119
- But I thought--
- I couldn't turn down the money.


1192
01:01:56.119 --> 01:01:58.411
But you said you weren't happy.

1193
01:01:58.411 --> 01:02:02.619
Being happy won't help my
parents reopen the restaurant.


1194
01:02:02.619 --> 01:02:05.744
No, I, I guess it won't.

1195
01:02:08.452 --> 01:02:12.035
I'm sorry. I just--
I wanted you to know.


1196
01:02:12.035 --> 01:02:14.119
Yeah.
You don't have to apologize.


1197
01:02:14.119 --> 01:02:15.952
You're putting
your family first.


1198
01:02:15.952 --> 01:02:18.160
It's a good thing.

1199
01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:22.494
Thank you for understanding.

1200
01:02:22.494 --> 01:02:25.244
Yeah, of course.

1201
01:02:27.536 --> 01:02:29.536
Come on.

1202
01:02:41.828 --> 01:02:44.828
Taylor, I have no doubt that
whatever you make,


1203
01:02:44.828 --> 01:02:46.869
it's going to be amazing.

1204
01:02:46.869 --> 01:02:49.619
Hopefully, we'll see.

1205
01:02:49.619 --> 01:02:54.119
Hey, all else fails, go with
fried chicken and ice cream.


1206
01:02:59.119 --> 01:03:01.244
Jacob, you're a genius.

1207
01:03:01.244 --> 01:03:02.578
What did I say?

1208
01:03:02.578 --> 01:03:04.786
I think I know what
I'm gonna make.


1209
01:03:04.786 --> 01:03:06.828
Better get to it, then.

1210
01:03:13.327 --> 01:03:14.619
So I'll see you tomorrow?

1211
01:03:14.619 --> 01:03:16.910
You know it.

1212
01:03:36.619 --> 01:03:38.494
Hey, Patty.

1213
01:03:38.494 --> 01:03:40.661
You mind just doing me a favor?
I just need a phone number.


1214
01:03:50.536 --> 01:03:52.536
Why can't we just use the stuff
that's already cut up?


1215
01:03:52.536 --> 01:03:55.119
Because we want it to be fresh.

1216
01:03:55.119 --> 01:03:57.327
- Why?
- Because the food we make


1217
01:03:57.327 --> 01:04:00.827
is only as good as the
ingredients we use to make it.


1218
01:04:00.827 --> 01:04:03.161
Here. What's it taste like?

1219
01:04:04.827 --> 01:04:06.161
Parsley.

1220
01:04:06.161 --> 01:04:11.035
Well, duh.
We know it's parsley, silly.


1221
01:04:11.035 --> 01:04:13.161
What's it taste like?
Describe it.


1222
01:04:13.161 --> 01:04:16.244
- Pepper.
- Good. What else?


1223
01:04:17.619 --> 01:04:19.910
- Dirt.
- Right.


1224
01:04:19.910 --> 01:04:23.785
But when something tastes
like dirt, we call it earthy.


1225
01:04:23.785 --> 01:04:25.119
Why?

1226
01:04:25.119 --> 01:04:27.744
I don't know.
Sounds better.


1227
01:04:39.994 --> 01:04:41.910
Young beauty.

1228
01:04:43.661 --> 01:04:45.244
Is everything okay?

1229
01:04:45.244 --> 01:04:48.453
I saw Jacob's car pulling away.

1230
01:04:48.453 --> 01:04:51.369
Yeah, he just came to drop off
some blueberries.


1231
01:04:51.369 --> 01:04:53.286
How'd the appointment go?

1232
01:04:53.286 --> 01:04:56.952
Eh, it went well, I mean,
you know, the doctor says I'm,


1233
01:04:56.952 --> 01:04:58.910
I'm healing nicely.

1234
01:04:58.910 --> 01:05:00.952
- Well, that's good news.
- Yeah.


1235
01:05:00.952 --> 01:05:02.619
So you up for some cooking?

1236
01:05:02.619 --> 01:05:05.161
Oh, ma'am, I thought
you'd never ask me.


1237
01:05:18.036 --> 01:05:19.827
Like the old days, huh?

1238
01:05:19.827 --> 01:05:22.161
I know, right?

1239
01:05:22.161 --> 01:05:25.578
Creator of the classic
chicken dipped in ice cream,


1240
01:05:25.578 --> 01:05:27.453
and it's on every menu
of every restaurant.


1241
01:05:27.453 --> 01:05:29.661
Oh, come on.
Wouldn't that be amazing?


1242
01:05:29.661 --> 01:05:31.994
Like a hamburger.

1243
01:05:32.411 --> 01:05:33.952
I got the lemons.

1244
01:05:33.952 --> 01:05:35.494
All right. Hold on, okay.

1245
01:05:37.536 --> 01:05:40.619
- Yeah. Maybe fold it.
- Here.

1267
01:06:58.494 --> 01:07:01.328
So you're telling me that
Jacob talking about dipping his


1268
01:07:01.328 --> 01:07:04.161
fried chicken into the ice cream
is how you came up


1269
01:07:04.161 --> 01:07:05.619
with all of this?

1270
01:07:05.619 --> 01:07:07.785
Yes, some pretty unexpected
ingredients, huh?


1271
01:07:07.785 --> 01:07:10.161
Sure is.

1272
01:07:10.494 --> 01:07:13.036
Yeah, well, I'm just excited
about the desserts.


1273
01:07:13.036 --> 01:07:14.619
You're always excited
about the desserts.


1274
01:07:14.619 --> 01:07:18.827
Yeah, well, as long as it's not
baked Alaskan flambé.


1275
01:07:18.827 --> 01:07:21.161
I almost died that day.

1276
01:07:49.494 --> 01:07:51.453
Hope they don't mind a
little unfinished painting.


1277
01:07:51.453 --> 01:07:53.411
Well, they're not here
to judge us on that.


1278
01:07:53.411 --> 01:07:55.328
They're here for the food.

1279
01:07:55.328 --> 01:07:57.036
How's our chef?

1280
01:07:57.036 --> 01:07:59.952
Oh, I'm a little nervous,
but I'll um, I'll manage.


1281
01:07:59.952 --> 01:08:01.869
Not you, silly.

1282
01:08:01.869 --> 01:08:02.827
They're ready for dessert.

1283
01:08:02.827 --> 01:08:04.535
- Ooh.
- Right, okay.


1284
01:08:05.286 --> 01:08:09.660
Okay. There ya go.
Do you know who's here?


1285
01:08:09.660 --> 01:08:10.785
No, who?

1286
01:08:10.785 --> 01:08:17.286
Chef Coe.
The one who beat Bobby Flay?


1287
01:08:17.286 --> 01:08:18.952
- Mm-hmm.
- Corner!


1288
01:08:18.952 --> 01:08:20.952
Oh, thanks, Mom.

1289
01:08:20.952 --> 01:08:24.244
Okay.

1290
01:08:24.244 --> 01:08:26.535
- Let's go.
- Chef Coe.


1291
01:08:46.827 --> 01:08:50.328
We have a vanilla and blueberry
ice cream-filled donut sandwich


1292
01:08:50.328 --> 01:08:54.619
with blueberry marble glaze.
Enjoy.


1293
01:09:09.994 --> 01:09:12.369
The bacon is a nice touch.

1294
01:09:12.369 --> 01:09:14.453
Thank you, Chef Coe.

1295
01:09:21.619 --> 01:09:22.786
We ready?

1296
01:09:22.786 --> 01:09:24.036
- I think so.
- Okay.


1297
01:09:25.036 --> 01:09:26.619
Best of luck.
Thank you.


1298
01:09:26.619 --> 01:09:28.660
Thank you.

1299
01:09:37.411 --> 01:09:40.119
Oh!

1300
01:09:40.119 --> 01:09:44.286
Oh, boy.
It's out of our hands now.


1301
01:09:44.286 --> 01:09:47.994
But, honey,
we are so proud of you.


1302
01:09:47.994 --> 01:09:50.619
Oh, it was a team effort.

1303
01:09:50.619 --> 01:09:53.411
Let's clean up
and enjoy the festival.


1304
01:09:53.411 --> 01:09:55.119
Yes, I will get the plates.

1305
01:09:55.119 --> 01:09:57.994
Yeah, the last plate there,
he didn't eat very much.


1306
01:09:57.994 --> 01:10:00.411
Can I have that last one?

1307
01:10:00.411 --> 01:10:02.119
I have a whole one
for you in the back.


1308
01:10:02.119 --> 01:10:04.452
Oh, you're my idol.

1309
01:10:04.452 --> 01:10:06.410
- We'll be in the kitchen.
- Aw, thank you.


1310
01:10:12.328 --> 01:10:15.994
Talk on the street is
Sea Sea Riders


1311
01:10:15.994 --> 01:10:18.702
kicked some booty!

1312
01:10:19.869 --> 01:10:22.244
What are you doing here?

1313
01:10:22.244 --> 01:10:23.786
You think that I would
let my best friend


1314
01:10:23.786 --> 01:10:25.619
make it through an entire
cooking competition


1315
01:10:25.619 --> 01:10:28.328
without showing a little love?

1316
01:10:28.827 --> 01:10:30.786
How'd it go?

1317
01:10:30.786 --> 01:10:32.994
Good, I think.

1318
01:10:32.994 --> 01:10:34.786
You think?

1319
01:10:34.786 --> 01:10:36.786
Girl, I know your food.

1320
01:10:36.786 --> 01:10:39.203
If those judges weren't blown
away by whatever it is you made,


1321
01:10:39.203 --> 01:10:41.827
they probably shouldn't
be judges.


1322
01:10:41.827 --> 01:10:44.203
You're ridiculous.

1323
01:10:44.203 --> 01:10:46.036
How did it go with the network?

1324
01:10:46.036 --> 01:10:47.911
Let's talk about that later.

1325
01:10:47.911 --> 01:10:49.328
Let me help you with these.

1326
01:10:49.328 --> 01:10:52.119
Thank you.

1327
01:10:52.119 --> 01:10:53.994
So where's Jacob?

1328
01:10:53.994 --> 01:10:56.286
Oh, well, he said he had
some things to take care of


1329
01:10:56.286 --> 01:10:58.036
at the farm.
Why?


1330
01:10:58.036 --> 01:11:00.410
- Just wondering.
- Oh.


1331
01:11:00.410 --> 01:11:01.994
So back here,
have you seen the...


1332
01:11:01.994 --> 01:11:03.161
I can't remember.

1333
01:11:27.744 --> 01:11:29.327
No, it's fine.

1334
01:11:29.327 --> 01:11:31.952
I mean, no, Jessica, I am still
not used to golf carts


1335
01:11:31.952 --> 01:11:33.410
all these years later.
You think I would--


1336
01:11:33.410 --> 01:11:34.619
I love them.

1337
01:11:34.619 --> 01:11:36.452
They keep getting
more and more fancy.


1338
01:11:36.452 --> 01:11:38.369
I mean, look at this.

1339
01:11:39.327 --> 01:11:41.535
Guys, you need this golf cart.

1340
01:11:42.535 --> 01:11:44.286
They do this every year?

1341
01:11:44.286 --> 01:11:46.452
Yeah,
it's grown so much.


1342
01:11:46.452 --> 01:11:48.827
I still can't believe we pulled
everything together in time.


1343
01:11:48.827 --> 01:11:50.786
I've never had a doubt
in my mind.


1344
01:11:50.786 --> 01:11:52.452
Same.

1345
01:11:52.452 --> 01:11:54.203
If anyone can pull off a food
competition, it's this girl.


1346
01:11:54.203 --> 01:11:56.286
That's how the network
found her after all.


1347
01:11:56.286 --> 01:11:59.036
Speaking of the network,
before we go in,


1348
01:11:59.036 --> 01:12:01.119
there's something I want to
talk to you guys about.


1349
01:12:01.119 --> 01:12:03.078
What is it, sweetie?

1350
01:12:03.078 --> 01:12:04.619
I've decided to take the show.

1351
01:12:04.619 --> 01:12:06.327
QED?

1352
01:12:06.327 --> 01:12:08.452
Mm-hmm, and with the
money I'll be making,


1353
01:12:08.452 --> 01:12:09.911
I want to help the restaurant
get back on its feet


1354
01:12:09.911 --> 01:12:11.744
and open its doors.

1355
01:12:11.744 --> 01:12:14.619
- Junebug--
- Guys, listen. Hear me out.


1356
01:12:14.619 --> 01:12:18.452
I think with a little TLC and
a few small tweaks to the menu,


1357
01:12:18.452 --> 01:12:21.827
I think the restaurant
could thrive again.


1358
01:12:21.827 --> 01:12:25.994
It's sweet of you, but money
really isn't the problem.


1359
01:12:25.994 --> 01:12:27.786
What do you mean?

1360
01:12:27.786 --> 01:12:32.078
After 35 years, your father
and I are ready to retire.


1361
01:12:32.078 --> 01:12:35.577
Maybe travel the world a little.

1362
01:12:37.410 --> 01:12:40.452
I was hoping that cooking
together in the competition


1363
01:12:40.452 --> 01:12:42.410
might change your minds.

1364
01:12:42.410 --> 01:12:45.119
Sweetie, I never had
so much fun in the kitchen


1365
01:12:45.119 --> 01:12:47.953
since the days
of Grandma CC.


1366
01:12:47.953 --> 01:12:51.702
I mean, you reminded me
of all the reasons why I,


1367
01:12:51.702 --> 01:12:54.161
why I fell in love with cooking.

1368
01:12:54.161 --> 01:12:57.410
But we too have to move on.

1369
01:12:57.827 --> 01:13:01.535
Just because we're starting
a new chapter in our lives


1370
01:13:01.535 --> 01:13:05.327
doesn't mean the restaurant
needs to leave the family.


1371
01:13:08.661 --> 01:13:11.661
Are you offering me
the restaurant?


1372
01:13:14.827 --> 01:13:17.327
If you want it.

1373
01:13:19.078 --> 01:13:22.452
I don't have the money to
reopen the restaurant on my own.


1374
01:13:22.452 --> 01:13:25.244
Maybe I can help you with that.

1375
01:13:25.244 --> 01:13:28.661
Jess, you're my best friend.
I can't accept a loan from you.


1376
01:13:28.661 --> 01:13:30.619
Oh, no, no,
it wouldn't be a loan.


1377
01:13:30.619 --> 01:13:33.786
It would be a capital
contribution as part owner,


1378
01:13:33.786 --> 01:13:35.452
if you're open to it.

1379
01:13:35.452 --> 01:13:38.161
You mean like partners?

1380
01:13:38.494 --> 01:13:41.619
Your talents are limitless.
With the right team behind you,


1381
01:13:41.619 --> 01:13:43.619
I mean, there may even
be a few stars in your future,


1382
01:13:43.619 --> 01:13:45.410
if you know what I mean.

1383
01:13:47.327 --> 01:13:49.577
What about the show?

1384
01:13:49.577 --> 01:13:52.661
Yeah, I, I didn't
send the contract in.


1385
01:13:52.661 --> 01:13:54.078
What?

1386
01:13:54.078 --> 01:13:56.702
I
-I-
- Something just felt off,

1387
01:13:56.702 --> 01:13:59.619
so I decided I would
sit on it for a couple of days.


1388
01:13:59.619 --> 01:14:01.786
And then I got the call
from Jacob and...


1389
01:14:01.786 --> 01:14:03.827
here we are.

1390
01:14:04.827 --> 01:14:07.369
Jacob called you?

1391
01:14:10.953 --> 01:14:12.994
They're about ready to announce
the winners of the competition.


1392
01:14:12.994 --> 01:14:15.327
Come on, let's go.

1393
01:14:21.244 --> 01:14:23.953
Hello, Dunedin!

1394
01:14:26.661 --> 01:14:28.953
Welcome one and all!

1395
01:14:28.953 --> 01:14:31.078
We now move to the grand finale

1396
01:14:31.078 --> 01:14:34.994
and the final event of the
Food and Wine Festival,


1397
01:14:34.994 --> 01:14:37.577
where the winner will be crowned

1398
01:14:37.577 --> 01:14:40.078
Dunedin's Best Restaurant
of the Year.


1399
01:14:42.285 --> 01:14:48.244
And awarded the Golden Spatula
for culinary excellence.


1400
01:14:48.244 --> 01:14:50.369
Now I need to know

1401
01:14:50.369 --> 01:14:51.953
who's ready to find out who won.

1402
01:14:54.452 --> 01:14:59.369
I have to admit, I have to admit
the competition was fierce


1403
01:14:59.369 --> 01:15:01.744
this year, ladies and gentlemen.

1404
01:15:01.744 --> 01:15:06.577
And some very difficult
decisions had to be made.


1405
01:15:06.577 --> 01:15:08.577
But the results are in,

1406
01:15:08.577 --> 01:15:11.202
and I hold in my hand

1407
01:15:11.202 --> 01:15:13.994
the three finalists.

1408
01:15:15.285 --> 01:15:17.869
And in third place,

1409
01:15:17.869 --> 01:15:21.244
with their barbecue entree
and apple pie dessert,


1410
01:15:21.244 --> 01:15:24.078
we have Papi O'Brien's!

1411
01:15:31.661 --> 01:15:35.869
And now the moment
we have all been waiting for.


1412
01:15:35.869 --> 01:15:40.244
Between the Wild Irish Cafe
and Sea Sea Riders.


1413
01:15:43.369 --> 01:15:48.244
The winner of this year's Food
and Wine Festival Cook-Off is...


1414
01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:53.911
Sea Sea Riders

1415
01:15:53.911 --> 01:15:56.619
with their blueberry
chicken and waffle entree


1416
01:15:56.619 --> 01:16:00.702
and ice cream-stuffed
blueberry donut dessert!


1417
01:16:02.786 --> 01:16:05.327
In tradition, will the owner
of Sea Sea Riders


1418
01:16:05.327 --> 01:16:07.369
come on up on stage?

1419
01:16:08.244 --> 01:16:10.619
It's yours if you want it.

1420
01:16:10.619 --> 01:16:13.077
You deserve it. Get up there.

1421
01:16:15.869 --> 01:16:19.369
And to present the award
to our winner this year,


1422
01:16:19.369 --> 01:16:23.077
Jacob Dylan,
owner of Harbor Farms.


1423
01:16:23.077 --> 01:16:24.619
Oh yeah.

1424
01:16:28.119 --> 01:16:29.786
Thank you.

1425
01:16:29.786 --> 01:16:33.369
Good food and good traditions
have been the bedrock of Dunedin


1426
01:16:33.369 --> 01:16:35.327
long since before I was born.

1427
01:16:35.327 --> 01:16:38.786
That's what this represents.

1428
01:16:38.786 --> 01:16:42.244
On behalf of Harbor Farms
and the great town of Dunedin,


1429
01:16:42.244 --> 01:16:46.160
it is my pleasure to give this
Golden Spatula Award


1430
01:16:46.160 --> 01:16:47.494
to Sea Sea Riders.

1431
01:16:51.911 --> 01:16:53.661
Sea Sea!

1432
01:17:00.327 --> 01:17:04.577
Oh, thank you. You know,
I spent my entire childhood


1433
01:17:04.577 --> 01:17:09.244
wondering what life would be
like outside small town Dunedin.


1434
01:17:09.244 --> 01:17:13.661
I have lived in big cities,
worked at fancy restaurants,


1435
01:17:13.661 --> 01:17:16.869
but none of it's made me
as happy as this past week,


1436
01:17:16.869 --> 01:17:22.077
creating new dishes,
connecting with old friends,


1437
01:17:22.077 --> 01:17:24.369
and spending time with my
amazing mom and dad,


1438
01:17:24.369 --> 01:17:26.703
Patty and Glenn Rider.

1439
01:17:28.786 --> 01:17:31.869
Thank you for reminding me
what really matters.


1440
01:17:32.119 --> 01:17:34.327
This one's for you guys.

1441
01:17:34.327 --> 01:17:36.536
Thank you, everyone.

1442
01:18:11.911 --> 01:18:13.411
Thought I'd find you here.

1443
01:18:13.411 --> 01:18:15.119
Mind if I join?

1444
01:18:15.119 --> 01:18:18.202
Of course.

1445
01:18:19.494 --> 01:18:21.952
Are you really
taking over the restaurant?


1446
01:18:21.952 --> 01:18:24.786
I am.

1447
01:18:24.786 --> 01:18:27.910
What made you change your mind
about the show?


1448
01:18:27.910 --> 01:18:30.786
Well, when my parents offered me
the restaurant,


1449
01:18:30.786 --> 01:18:33.244
I just followed my heart.

1450
01:18:33.494 --> 01:18:36.452
You know what Grandma CC would
say if she were here right now?


1451
01:18:36.452 --> 01:18:39.077
- Grandma CC always knows best.
- Grandma CC always knows best.


1452
01:18:40.869 --> 01:18:42.035
You know, it's a good thing

1453
01:18:42.035 --> 01:18:44.578
Jessica didn't
turn in those contracts.


1454
01:18:44.578 --> 01:18:46.077
Bold move, sir.

1455
01:18:46.077 --> 01:18:48.744
Hey, the contract idea
was all Jessica.


1456
01:18:48.744 --> 01:18:51.619
I just called for
some friendly advice.


1457
01:18:51.910 --> 01:18:54.077
This restaurant's gonna take
a lot of work.


1458
01:18:54.077 --> 01:18:57.703
And since when have you
ever been afraid of hard work?


1459
01:18:58.910 --> 01:19:02.119
Hey, why didn't you tell me
about the farm?


1460
01:19:02.494 --> 01:19:03.910
I don't know, I just figured

1461
01:19:03.910 --> 01:19:05.952
you had so many
assumptions about me,


1462
01:19:05.952 --> 01:19:08.202
I'd just let you run with them.

1463
01:19:12.910 --> 01:19:16.244
I did have a lot of
assumptions about you.


1464
01:19:16.244 --> 01:19:18.744
I'm sorry.

1465
01:19:19.119 --> 01:19:20.744
It's okay,

1466
01:19:20.744 --> 01:19:22.952
I forgive you this time.

1467
01:19:27.077 --> 01:19:31.952
I am so glad
that you're staying.


1468
01:19:31.952 --> 01:19:33.744
I am too.

1469
01:19:35.994 --> 01:19:38.452
I'm crazy about you,
Jacob Dylan.


1470
01:19:38.452 --> 01:19:42.828
And I am so crazy
about you, too.


1471
01:20:09.452 --> 01:20:12.910
- Okay, here we are.
- Okay.


1472
01:20:12.910 --> 01:20:15.869
We have two featured items
for our soft opening.


1473
01:20:15.869 --> 01:20:18.910
Pan-seared grouper
and fire-roasted pork.


1474
01:20:18.910 --> 01:20:21.369
Everything else you see
on those plates


1475
01:20:21.369 --> 01:20:23.286
is from this handsome guy's
farm.


1476
01:20:23.286 --> 01:20:26.244
- Wow. Crazy.
- Okay.


1477
01:20:26.244 --> 01:20:27.744
- Dig in.
- This is amazing.


1478
01:20:29.703 --> 01:20:31.703
Oh, you're gonna love this.

1479
01:20:36.327 --> 01:20:37.994
I cannot make their faces...

1480
01:20:38.619 --> 01:20:40.661
I'm no food critic,

1481
01:20:40.661 --> 01:20:42.369
but this is da bomb.

1482
01:20:43.661 --> 01:20:45.952
Please never use
that phrase again.


1483
01:20:45.952 --> 01:20:47.785
But I do agree.

1484
01:20:47.785 --> 01:20:49.119
- You like it?
- Yeah.


1485
01:20:49.119 --> 01:20:50.494
It is great.

1486
01:20:50.494 --> 01:20:52.910
It does.
It looks fantastic, babe.


1487
01:20:52.910 --> 01:20:54.244
Aw.

1488
01:20:54.244 --> 01:20:55.952
I want to thank you so much
for your support--


1489
01:20:55.952 --> 01:20:58.453
That's what I'm saying,
Mr. Thompson.


1490
01:20:58.453 --> 01:21:00.619
You kn--
hold on a second.


1491
01:21:03.119 --> 01:21:04.827
Smile.

1492
01:21:11.369 --> 01:21:13.744
No, I'm sorry.
I was sending you a pic.


1493
01:21:13.744 --> 01:21:16.119
Yeah-
-No, where were we?

1494
01:21:16.119 --> 01:21:20.744
Right, that's fine, as long as
the contracts arrive this week.


1495
01:21:20.744 --> 01:21:23.244
Payment up front.

1496
01:21:23.244 --> 01:21:25.202
Perfect.

1497
01:21:25.202 --> 01:21:28.327
Yes. All right.
I'll talk to you soon. Bye.


1498
01:21:29.453 --> 01:21:30.578
Ma|am the deed is done.

1499
01:21:30.578 --> 01:21:32.952
Two episodes a week
shot right here.


1500
01:21:37.744 --> 01:21:41.327
This show is going to be a hit.

1501
01:21:41.327 --> 01:21:45.744
And at the center of it all
will be the two of you.


1502
01:21:46.286 --> 01:21:48.744
I'm so proud of you, babe.

1503
01:21:49.244 --> 01:21:51.369
