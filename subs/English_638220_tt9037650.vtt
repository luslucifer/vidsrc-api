1
00:00:17.393 --> 00:00:20.104
Does everyone have turnip chips?

2
00:00:20.271 --> 00:00:21.230
THE RETURN OF THE ELFKINS

3
00:00:21.397 --> 00:00:23.190
Be quiet!

4
00:00:24.316 --> 00:00:25.359
That was my foot!

5
00:00:26.318 --> 00:00:28.320
I can't wait to see this.

6
00:00:29.405 --> 00:00:31.323
It's starting.

7
00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:33.284
Welcome, dear friends,

8
00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.245
to this year's Elfkin Festival.

9
00:00:36.412 --> 00:00:40.165
Like every year,
the first performance will be...


10
00:00:40.332 --> 00:00:41.250
Vendla!

11
00:00:41.417 --> 00:00:43.335
Could we wait just a moment?

12
00:00:43.502 --> 00:00:45.296
Elfie is missing.

13
00:00:46.255 --> 00:00:48.173
We'll start without her.

14
00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.136
We're about to hear the famous legend
of our ancestors:


15
00:00:52.303 --> 00:00:54.221
the Elfkins of Cologne!

16
00:00:56.223 --> 00:00:58.267
In old Cologne, in times long gone,

17
00:00:58.434 --> 00:01:00.352
the Elfkins helped things move along.

18
00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:03.272
The lazy man would think it best

19
00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:06.233
to just lie down and get some rest.

20
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.277
Then late at night...

21
00:01:08.444 --> 00:01:09.445
Dratted hat!

22
00:01:10.237 --> 00:01:11.322
I can't see a thing.

23
00:01:12.323 --> 00:01:13.324
Sorry!

24
00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.367
I just wanted to check our set.

25
00:01:16.285 --> 00:01:17.453
The show will go on in a moment.

26
00:01:22.374 --> 00:01:23.459
Where was I?

27
00:01:24.251 --> 00:01:25.336
"Then late at night..."

28
00:01:25.502 --> 00:01:28.339
Then late at night they would appear

29
00:01:28.505 --> 00:01:31.258
and start their secret work with cheer.

30
00:01:31.425 --> 00:01:34.345
They swarmed around with tools in hand

31
00:01:34.511 --> 00:01:38.307
And combed and cawed
and sewed and sawed.


32
00:01:38.474 --> 00:01:40.392
The lazy bones, back on his feet,

33
00:01:40.559 --> 00:01:42.436
would find his daily work complete!

34
00:01:44.521 --> 00:01:46.398
It's a lovely story.

35
00:01:46.565 --> 00:01:49.318
But does it have a happy ending?

36
00:01:50.402 --> 00:01:51.362
No!

37
00:01:51.528 --> 00:01:54.239
One day, a tailor
found himself in a plight:

38
00:01:54.406 --> 00:01:56.367
Finish the mayor's frock overnight.

39
00:01:57.284 --> 00:01:59.411
They crept up to the sewing stand

40
00:01:59.578 --> 00:02:02.331
and cut and darned and sewed by hand.

41
00:02:02.498 --> 00:02:04.500
Backstitch, topstitch, slipstitch...

42
00:02:05.376 --> 00:02:07.503
Before the tailor had finished dreaming,

43
00:02:08.337 --> 00:02:11.382
the frock was ready, neat and gleaming.

44
00:02:13.384 --> 00:02:16.387
It's trendy.
People wear it like this now.


45
00:02:17.513 --> 00:02:22.351
But the hard-working Elfkins
were never properly thanked.


46
00:02:22.518 --> 00:02:25.354
Enter Kipp.
Big hat, tiny brain.


47
00:02:25.521 --> 00:02:27.439
The nosy tailor's wife

48
00:02:27.606 --> 00:02:30.484
wanted to see the helpers
with her own eyes,


49
00:02:32.486 --> 00:02:35.447
so she scattered peas across the floor.

50
00:02:36.365 --> 00:02:38.325
Poor, tireless Elfkins.

51
00:02:38.492 --> 00:02:42.371
They stumbled, slipped and crashed
down the basement stairs.


52
00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.541
No one ever saw them again.

53
00:02:46.458 --> 00:02:49.294
The humans haven't stopped complaining since:

54
00:02:49.461 --> 00:02:51.547
"We'd turn back time if we only could."

55
00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:55.426
But those carefree days
are gone for good.


56
00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.346
The script says
you fall down the steps too.


57
00:03:00.347 --> 00:03:01.515
Over my dead body.

58
00:03:03.434 --> 00:03:05.352
Missed me, dummy!

59
00:03:06.478 --> 00:03:08.480
Unbelievable! Just you wait.

60
00:03:11.483 --> 00:03:12.568
I've had enough.

61
00:03:16.363 --> 00:03:17.364
No panties.

62
00:03:17.531 --> 00:03:18.532
You show her, Elfie!

63
00:03:21.577 --> 00:03:23.454
That's all you've got?

64
00:03:24.455 --> 00:03:25.539
Attack!

65
00:03:28.542 --> 00:03:30.544
Looks like she needs a hand.

66
00:03:43.515 --> 00:03:44.600
I'm the hero of this story!

67
00:03:45.434 --> 00:03:46.560
Not this time.

68
00:03:47.436 --> 00:03:50.439
Now listen up:
Elfkins can't be pushed around.


69
00:03:50.606 --> 00:03:52.524
Be nice to us,
and we'll be nice back.

70
00:03:52.691 --> 00:03:53.609
Well said!

71
00:03:54.443 --> 00:03:57.446
That's nothing to applaud.
Humans are simply unkind.


72
00:03:57.613 --> 00:04:00.407
How do you know?
You've never met one.


73
00:04:00.574 --> 00:04:04.411
But I know the legend.
Humans are mean and ungrateful.


74
00:04:04.578 --> 00:04:06.371
And much too big.

75
00:04:06.538 --> 00:04:10.417
For generations,
we've lived in peace down here.


76
00:04:10.584 --> 00:04:13.462
True, but it's gloomy and snoring-boring.

77
00:04:14.505 --> 00:04:16.423
And cramped.
- No, it's not.


78
00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:17.424
I like it here.

79
00:04:17.591 --> 00:04:19.426
Vendla's right, Elfie.

80
00:04:19.593 --> 00:04:22.638
Everyone here can fulfill the Elfkin mission
their own way.


81
00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:24.556
And what's our mission?

82
00:04:25.557 --> 00:04:27.518
Mastering a handicraft.

83
00:04:27.684 --> 00:04:30.437
Which handicraft have you mastered?

84
00:04:30.604 --> 00:04:34.566
You'll see! This year,
I'll win something in the Hat Competition.


85
00:04:34.733 --> 00:04:39.488
Your attempts at learning a craft
have failed miserably so far.


86
00:04:47.579 --> 00:04:51.416
That's why your hat
is the smallest and tattiest of all.


87
00:04:51.583 --> 00:04:53.418
That's not going to change.

88
00:04:53.585 --> 00:04:56.630
It will soon,
because my ideas are Elfienesque!


89
00:05:04.555 --> 00:05:07.558
And now to the highlight of our celebration:

90
00:05:08.559 --> 00:05:10.519
The Hat Competition.

91
00:05:10.686 --> 00:05:14.523
You can pack up your things.
I'm getting the hat.


92
00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:15.566
I think Urgi will win.

93
00:05:15.732 --> 00:05:18.569
Alfy made a toothbrush
that's also a shoe brush.


94
00:05:18.735 --> 00:05:20.445
But that's pointless.

95
00:05:20.612 --> 00:05:22.573
So, what do we have here?

96
00:05:22.739 --> 00:05:25.534
A turnip basket. Very good.

97
00:05:26.535 --> 00:05:30.497
I dyed them mud brown
so you can't see the dirt.


98
00:05:30.664 --> 00:05:32.583
What a practical idea, Ada.

99
00:05:33.667 --> 00:05:36.461
Ouch! Hats above!
- Very nice.


100
00:05:36.628 --> 00:05:38.547
Kipp, what have you made this time?

101
00:05:38.714 --> 00:05:39.673
A chair.

102
00:05:40.549 --> 00:05:41.592
Nicely done.

103
00:05:41.758 --> 00:05:43.552
The woodworking is perfect.

104
00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:45.470
It's no ordinary chair.

105
00:05:45.637 --> 00:05:47.723
The legs are the best part.

106
00:05:49.641 --> 00:05:53.645
Now matter how low the ceiling,
you can sit in total comfort.


107
00:05:54.521 --> 00:05:55.647
Wow. Amazing!

108
00:05:55.814 --> 00:05:57.608
A brilliant idea, Kipp!

109
00:05:57.774 --> 00:06:00.611
A wonderful example
of Elfkin craftsmanship.


110
00:06:00.777 --> 00:06:02.613
Wait until you see this.

111
00:06:05.532 --> 00:06:09.578
Presenting the one and only
Elfienesque turnip harvester.


112
00:06:11.538 --> 00:06:13.749
No more harvesting stupid turnips by hand.

113
00:06:14.625 --> 00:06:16.710
It'll never work, that's obvious.

114
00:06:24.551 --> 00:06:26.678
It's knocked your hats off, right?

115
00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:31.725
Quick, out of the way!
- Hats above!


116
00:06:35.604 --> 00:06:37.606
This wasn't part of the plan.

117
00:06:38.649 --> 00:06:39.691
Go away!

118
00:06:51.662 --> 00:06:53.664
It could have been worse.

119
00:06:54.748 --> 00:06:55.707
We're fine.

120
00:06:55.874 --> 00:06:57.793
Help. Help!
- It's Vendla.


121
00:06:59.711 --> 00:07:00.837
Are you okay, Vendla?

122
00:07:01.797 --> 00:07:03.548
Nothing is okay.

123
00:07:03.715 --> 00:07:07.678
We may be safe from humans down here,
but she's a danger to us all.


124
00:07:07.844 --> 00:07:10.639
I'm really sorry.

125
00:07:10.806 --> 00:07:14.768
I just thought we could...
-...make things "Elfier" down here!


126
00:07:15.602 --> 00:07:17.604
It's less Elfie we need!

127
00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:20.649
I just wanted to...

128
00:07:20.816 --> 00:07:24.653
You'll never be a true Elfkin.

129
00:07:25.654 --> 00:07:26.697
But...

130
00:08:45.776 --> 00:08:47.736
Where are you going?

131
00:08:47.944 --> 00:08:49.863
I'm going up to the humans.

132
00:08:50.781 --> 00:08:51.782
Are you crazy?

133
00:08:51.948 --> 00:08:55.660
Vendla says
humans eat Elfkins for breakfast.


134
00:08:55.827 --> 00:08:56.870
They even eat the hats.

135
00:08:57.746 --> 00:08:58.747
It's not normal.

136
00:08:58.914 --> 00:09:02.709
I don't think they're really that bad, Buck.

137
00:09:02.876 --> 00:09:05.670
Take a look.
They're the best of friends.


138
00:09:05.837 --> 00:09:07.839
I'm going to find a human
to teach me a craft.


139
00:09:08.006 --> 00:09:12.719
When I come back, I won't be
a useless Elfkin with a tiny hat.


140
00:09:12.886 --> 00:09:15.806
But what will I do without you?

141
00:09:15.972 --> 00:09:17.808
I'll be back really soon.

142
00:09:17.974 --> 00:09:21.770
Elfkins are swift, smart and swoosh, right?

143
00:09:21.937 --> 00:09:23.772
Exactly! Swoosh!

144
00:09:23.939 --> 00:09:25.690
What does that mean?

145
00:09:25.857 --> 00:09:27.818
We do our work in a heartbeat,

146
00:09:27.984 --> 00:09:29.903
and before they know it, we're gone.

147
00:09:30.821 --> 00:09:32.864
There's nothing we can't do!

148
00:09:34.783 --> 00:09:35.951
Well, almost nothing.

149
00:09:46.878 --> 00:09:48.839
It's my masterpiece.

150
00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:04.938
I think I should come along.

151
00:10:05.939 --> 00:10:07.983
But you already have a craft.

152
00:10:08.859 --> 00:10:10.902
It's boring making candles all day.

153
00:10:11.069 --> 00:10:12.821
I want to see the sun.

154
00:10:12.988 --> 00:10:16.908
It's brighter than all candles put together.
- Oh, Buck!


155
00:10:32.924 --> 00:10:36.803
I didn't think the human world
would be this beautiful.


156
00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:38.889
How big do you think it is?

157
00:10:39.848 --> 00:10:43.852
If you ask me,
about 100 times bigger than ours.


158
00:10:44.978 --> 00:10:46.855
Don't exaggerate!

159
00:10:47.022 --> 00:10:49.900
When the sun shines, it's even bigger.

160
00:10:50.066 --> 00:10:51.943
It makes everything on Earth grow.

161
00:10:52.861 --> 00:10:54.905
Is that why humans are so big?

162
00:10:57.908 --> 00:10:59.993
Hey, that's against the rules.

163
00:11:00.911 --> 00:11:01.912
It's you!
- Come with me.


164
00:11:02.078 --> 00:11:03.872
Let me go.

165
00:11:10.921 --> 00:11:12.923
We have to go back
before the humans see us.


166
00:11:13.089 --> 00:11:15.800
So go. I have
something to take care of.

167
00:11:15.967 --> 00:11:17.886
She's learning a craft from the humans.

168
00:11:18.887 --> 00:11:21.806
I'll be back soon.
Tell the others I say hello.


169
00:11:21.973 --> 00:11:23.892
Are you out of your mind?

170
00:11:24.059 --> 00:11:28.021
Humans are sneaky and lazy.
You can't learn anything from them.


171
00:11:29.022 --> 00:11:30.065
Hey!

172
00:11:30.941 --> 00:11:31.942
Can anyone hear me?

173
00:11:32.108 --> 00:11:34.945
I'm out here, but it's not my fault.

174
00:11:37.906 --> 00:11:39.032
The sun!

175
00:11:41.868 --> 00:11:42.953
Have I grown yet?

176
00:11:44.079 --> 00:11:46.873
Look. A real bird.

177
00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:48.833
Flying must be amazing.

178
00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.086
There's a huge one
letting off a giant fart.

179
00:11:58.885 --> 00:12:00.053
Elfie, look at this.

180
00:12:00.929 --> 00:12:01.972
What is it?

181
00:12:02.138 --> 00:12:05.016
It's where humans keep their food.

182
00:12:06.059 --> 00:12:08.103
They really do live in paradise.

183
00:12:08.979 --> 00:12:12.023
Hello! Can anyone hear me?

184
00:12:15.068 --> 00:12:17.112
It can't get any worse than this.

185
00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:21.116
A pig-dog!

186
00:12:24.077 --> 00:12:25.954
Kipp? Wrong way!

187
00:12:26.121 --> 00:12:27.122
What's that?

188
00:12:28.164 --> 00:12:30.000
Looks delicious.

189
00:12:39.134 --> 00:12:40.969
What do we do now?

190
00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:54.107
Which way?
- Away from the pig-dog.


191
00:12:56.109 --> 00:12:57.110
Bye!

192
00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:00.071
Bad dog!

193
00:13:02.949 --> 00:13:04.159
What can he possibly want from us?

194
00:13:08.121 --> 00:13:09.998
What now? Do something!

195
00:13:10.165 --> 00:13:12.083
He won't hurt us.
He just wants to play.


196
00:13:13.001 --> 00:13:15.128
Are you sure?
- Hold on.


197
00:13:17.047 --> 00:13:18.131
That Way!

198
00:13:19.007 --> 00:13:20.050
Fetch!

199
00:13:23.178 --> 00:13:26.139
This is what she calls
an Elfienesque idea?


200
00:13:32.145 --> 00:13:35.065
Happy birthday to me

201
00:13:35.982 --> 00:13:38.193
Happy birthday to me

202
00:13:39.152 --> 00:13:42.197
Happy birthday, dear Theo,

203
00:13:42.989 --> 00:13:43.990
Happy birthday...

204
00:13:44.157 --> 00:13:47.077
<i>To make your day bright and nice,
come to Bruno's cake paradise.</i>


205
00:13:47.243 --> 00:13:50.038
As if! Try "cake hell."

206
00:13:54.084 --> 00:13:55.210
Hello!

207
00:13:58.046 --> 00:14:00.131
Didn't this used to be Hampus Bakery?

208
00:14:00.298 --> 00:14:02.133
I remember it differently.

209
00:14:03.009 --> 00:14:04.094
Me too.

210
00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:08.098
It's been closed for a while now.
- Oh, no!


211
00:14:08.264 --> 00:14:11.059
Those legendary cream spires!

212
00:14:11.267 --> 00:14:13.978
I loved them.

213
00:14:14.145 --> 00:14:16.106
I practically lived off them.

214
00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:19.025
Stay there.

215
00:14:20.068 --> 00:14:24.072
To make your day bright and nice,
come to Bruno's cake...


216
00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:25.281
Lovely!

217
00:14:26.157 --> 00:14:29.077
Just pop it in with Bruno's cakes.

218
00:14:32.163 --> 00:14:34.165
How dare you?
- Go back to Bruno's.


219
00:14:34.332 --> 00:14:37.252
No wonder you're bankrupt!
- You old bag.


220
00:14:46.261 --> 00:14:48.054
The coast is clear.

221
00:14:48.221 --> 00:14:50.056
Let go, you baby giant.

222
00:14:56.229 --> 00:14:58.314
Too bad. That was yummy.

223
00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:03.236
Not again.

224
00:15:08.241 --> 00:15:09.242
Catch me if you can!

225
00:15:14.247 --> 00:15:16.082
Head for the bush.

226
00:15:22.088 --> 00:15:25.133
Scram, mutt. This isn't your yard.

227
00:15:26.259 --> 00:15:27.218
That was close!

228
00:15:27.385 --> 00:15:29.220
Over there. Follow me.

229
00:15:29.387 --> 00:15:32.098
Great! Breaking and entering.

230
00:15:32.265 --> 00:15:33.266
This isn't good!

231
00:15:36.227 --> 00:15:37.145
Stupid mutt.

232
00:15:37.312 --> 00:15:39.147
We'll be safe in here.

233
00:15:40.231 --> 00:15:42.192
What if he does the same to us?

234
00:15:42.358 --> 00:15:46.237
He won't. Elfie knows
a thing or two about humans. Right?


235
00:15:49.115 --> 00:15:51.201
This looks like a kind of a workshop.

236
00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:04.130
It's a bakery.

237
00:16:04.297 --> 00:16:05.340
A bakery?

238
00:16:06.216 --> 00:16:08.176
As in... cakes?

239
00:16:09.219 --> 00:16:12.347
Look at that.
Humans have a Hat Competition too.


240
00:16:13.264 --> 00:16:14.224
But it's broken.

241
00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:17.352
Typical.
Humans always destroy everything.


242
00:16:24.192 --> 00:16:25.318
Look at that!

243
00:16:26.319 --> 00:16:27.403
Yummy.

244
00:16:29.239 --> 00:16:30.323
Cream hats.

245
00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:33.243
Brilliant!

246
00:16:35.161 --> 00:16:36.287
Scram!

247
00:16:44.254 --> 00:16:45.255
Oh, no, you don't.

248
00:16:45.421 --> 00:16:47.173
Stupid mutt!

249
00:16:56.307 --> 00:16:57.350
Tasty.

250
00:17:08.361 --> 00:17:11.197
Now I know what I want to be.

251
00:17:12.198 --> 00:17:13.324
A pastry chef!

252
00:17:14.284 --> 00:17:16.452
Then I'll win a
big hat like that too.

253
00:17:17.370 --> 00:17:18.454
YOU?

254
00:17:19.372 --> 00:17:21.249
That'll be the day.

255
00:17:21.416 --> 00:17:24.294
Well, maybe you can explain
why a pea-brain like you


256
00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:26.421
needs such a huge hat.

257
00:17:27.422 --> 00:17:29.299
Very funny.

258
00:17:33.219 --> 00:17:35.305
What the heck is going on here?

259
00:17:36.347 --> 00:17:37.432
Just what I need.

260
00:17:38.308 --> 00:17:39.350
Rats.

261
00:17:42.312 --> 00:17:45.315
Just you wait.
I'll show you who's boss.


262
00:17:47.317 --> 00:17:50.236
What did you say?
"We'll be safe in here?"


263
00:17:50.445 --> 00:17:52.405
Stop trembling!
- I'm not.


264
00:17:56.409 --> 00:17:58.369
It's just my body shaking.

265
00:18:00.413 --> 00:18:01.497
Get down!

266
00:18:04.334 --> 00:18:05.335
GOt you!

267
00:18:05.501 --> 00:18:08.296
I can't breathe.

268
00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:11.466
What are you?

269
00:18:12.342 --> 00:18:13.468
What do I look like?

270
00:18:16.304 --> 00:18:18.348
A garden gnome?

271
00:18:19.265 --> 00:18:21.351
No. You get one more shot.

272
00:18:22.268 --> 00:18:25.229
Maybe a... uh...

273
00:18:25.396 --> 00:18:27.357
Do I look like an "uh" to you?

274
00:18:27.523 --> 00:18:30.401
Fine. I'll help you out, just this once.

275
00:18:31.361 --> 00:18:35.323
I'm an Elf...
- What? No, that's impossible.


276
00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:38.326
An Elf...
- An elf fairy?


277
00:18:39.369 --> 00:18:42.372
"Fairy"? I'm an Elfkin!

278
00:18:43.331 --> 00:18:46.501
But... Elfkins and fairies don't exist.
You can't be real.


279
00:18:47.293 --> 00:18:49.504
Let her go, or you'll
see how real we are.

280
00:18:50.296 --> 00:18:53.424
We have a match,
and we're not afraid to use it.


281
00:18:56.386 --> 00:18:57.512
You'd better not.

282
00:18:58.429 --> 00:19:01.349
I'm fond of my bakery,
not to mention my...


283
00:19:01.557 --> 00:19:03.267
Who did this?

284
00:19:03.434 --> 00:19:04.310
Not me!

285
00:19:04.477 --> 00:19:07.313
I've never eaten anything that tasty.

286
00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:09.273
How did you make it?

287
00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:10.400
Oh, that?

288
00:19:11.526 --> 00:19:13.277
None of your business.

289
00:19:13.444 --> 00:19:17.281
Come on! Don't be
like that, Mr. Potato Nose.

290
00:19:17.448 --> 00:19:20.368
What's your name, anyway?
I'm Elfie.


291
00:19:22.412 --> 00:19:25.498
This is Buck,
and the pea-brain over there is Kipp.


292
00:19:27.458 --> 00:19:28.418
I'm Theo.

293
00:19:28.584 --> 00:19:30.378
Theo Hampus.

294
00:19:30.545 --> 00:19:32.547
Now that we're acquainted,

295
00:19:33.381 --> 00:19:36.426
I have a question,
from Elfkin to human


296
00:19:38.594 --> 00:19:41.597
Don't touch a thing.
And don't make a peep.


297
00:19:46.436 --> 00:19:48.396
Did you do that to Charles?

298
00:19:51.524 --> 00:19:52.525
Hello!

299
00:19:53.443 --> 00:19:55.486
You and your cream tart have three seconds

300
00:19:55.653 --> 00:19:57.447
before I throw you out.

301
00:19:57.613 --> 00:20:01.451
Wrong. I'm throwing you out.
You've been broke for ages.


302
00:20:02.493 --> 00:20:05.413
Because people only buy
your cheap gobstoppers.


303
00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:08.416
Better than your dusty old creations.
- Not again.


304
00:20:08.583 --> 00:20:10.626
You have no idea.
- No, you have no idea.


305
00:20:11.419 --> 00:20:12.503
No, you.
- No...


306
00:20:16.507 --> 00:20:17.467
Try this.

307
00:20:17.633 --> 00:20:19.510
Take that, wannabe genius.

308
00:20:19.677 --> 00:20:22.597
You pathetic show-off.
- Miserable sourpuss!


309
00:20:23.389 --> 00:20:24.599
Pompous jelly-belly!

310
00:20:25.433 --> 00:20:26.601
Hey! Not the cupcakes.

311
00:20:27.393 --> 00:20:28.478
Buck!

312
00:20:32.607 --> 00:20:36.402
You're the expert on humans.
He fights with everyone...


313
00:20:36.569 --> 00:20:40.531
But the sourpuss can bake better
than the jelly-belly.


314
00:20:43.409 --> 00:20:44.535
Get off me.
- Do you give up?


315
00:20:44.702 --> 00:20:46.454
No! Never!

316
00:20:47.413 --> 00:20:49.373
On the topic of giving up,

317
00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:52.376
can I remind you why we're here?

318
00:20:52.543 --> 00:20:53.461
What'?

319
00:20:53.628 --> 00:20:55.463
Oh, right.

320
00:20:57.465 --> 00:20:58.549
What's this?

321
00:20:58.716 --> 00:21:01.469
A detailed list of your unpaid bills.

322
00:21:01.636 --> 00:21:03.554
Electricity, gas, water...

323
00:21:03.721 --> 00:21:06.516
Let's cut to the chase.
I settled your debts.


324
00:21:06.682 --> 00:21:09.519
You have one week to pay me back.

325
00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:13.439
If you don't, the place is mine
and you can pack your bags.


326
00:21:13.606 --> 00:21:14.482
What?

327
00:21:14.649 --> 00:21:17.652
Oh yes, and happy birthday, brother dearest.

328
00:21:18.653 --> 00:21:20.571
It's worse than I thought.

329
00:21:22.532 --> 00:21:25.451
You really should have told us.

330
00:21:25.618 --> 00:21:28.454
Happy birthday
and a hat full of joy


331
00:21:28.621 --> 00:21:31.457
Happy birthday,
may you get a new toy...


332
00:21:34.544 --> 00:21:36.462
My home.

333
00:21:36.629 --> 00:21:38.464
No reason to lose your hat.

334
00:21:38.631 --> 00:21:40.424
If you just bake a bunch of cakes,

335
00:21:40.591 --> 00:21:44.470
you'll have more money
than you know what to do with.


336
00:21:47.557 --> 00:21:49.600
I guess I can go pack my bags.

337
00:21:50.685 --> 00:21:53.521
There goes your pastry chef dream.

338
00:21:53.688 --> 00:21:56.482
So we can finally go back home.

339
00:22:00.611 --> 00:22:02.488
No, wait!

340
00:22:02.655 --> 00:22:05.491
I can help you. 
We can all help you.

341
00:22:06.742 --> 00:22:08.619
We're Elfkins, after all.

342
00:22:12.582 --> 00:22:15.626
We work night and day,
and in between too.


343
00:22:24.635 --> 00:22:27.597
Don't worry, we'll use our Elfkin magic.

344
00:22:31.517 --> 00:22:33.519
You've just got to teach me to bake.

345
00:22:34.562 --> 00:22:36.480
You don't know how to bake?

346
00:22:36.647 --> 00:22:38.691
No, but it can't be that difficult.

347
00:22:39.650 --> 00:22:41.652
Let's get this lesson underway.

348
00:22:45.698 --> 00:22:47.658
I'll turn the oven on.

349
00:22:48.701 --> 00:22:50.661
Elfie knows what she's doing.

350
00:22:51.746 --> 00:22:53.497
Or maybe not!

351
00:22:53.664 --> 00:22:55.666
I'll put that out in
the drop of a hat.

352
00:22:57.752 --> 00:22:59.587
"Gasoline"?

353
00:22:59.754 --> 00:23:00.755
Never heard of it.

354
00:23:02.757 --> 00:23:04.550
Stop!

355
00:23:08.596 --> 00:23:10.473
Yet another problem solved.

356
00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:12.767
And so swooshily, or whatever that word is.

357
00:23:18.689 --> 00:23:22.693
Believe it or not,
we Elfkins are really handy to have around.


358
00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:24.695
If we're treated well.

359
00:23:26.614 --> 00:23:28.574
This is terrible treatment.

360
00:23:32.703 --> 00:23:34.747
I'm sorry.
I'll make it up to you.


361
00:23:36.791 --> 00:23:40.670
How? You just torched his baking supplies.

362
00:23:42.588 --> 00:23:45.549
<i>Don't miss our sale on plums today.</i>

363
00:23:45.716 --> 00:23:48.803
If I get him new ingredients,
he won't be angry anymore.


364
00:23:49.679 --> 00:23:50.721
It's teeming with humans!

365
00:23:50.888 --> 00:23:52.807
Your idea is totally ridiculous.

366
00:23:53.641 --> 00:23:54.767
No, it's Elfienesque.

367
00:23:55.810 --> 00:23:56.811
Same difference.

368
00:23:57.603 --> 00:23:59.689
We'll do it Elfkin style:
swift, smart and swoosh.


369
00:23:59.855 --> 00:24:03.609
Right. Swoosh!
- Forget it. I'm staying here.


370
00:24:05.611 --> 00:24:07.655
Go do your business, Charles.

371
00:24:09.657 --> 00:24:10.783
The pig-dog!

372
00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:14.662
Stop. Wait for me!

373
00:24:26.799 --> 00:24:28.634
Go.

374
00:24:31.804 --> 00:24:32.847
Oopsy daisy!

375
00:24:44.775 --> 00:24:45.818
Jelly beans!

376
00:24:46.777 --> 00:24:47.778
I'm flying!

377
00:24:50.698 --> 00:24:51.699
Oh boy.

378
00:25:07.798 --> 00:25:08.841
Yes!

379
00:25:12.803 --> 00:25:15.765
I'll help you.
Poor little doggie.


380
00:25:24.690 --> 00:25:27.777
Down, you rotten mutt.
- Not my hat!


381
00:25:36.869 --> 00:25:39.830
Harriet, sugarplum,
it's your favorite boss.


382
00:25:39.997 --> 00:25:41.874
Hi, boss,
- Where are you'?


383
00:25:44.919 --> 00:25:46.796
What happened to my store?

384
00:25:46.962 --> 00:25:48.798
<i>It wasn't me. 
It was Charles.</i>

385
00:25:48.964 --> 00:25:51.801
He went totally nuts. 
He probably saw a rat.

386
00:25:52.843 --> 00:25:53.928
<i>Was it wearing a hat?</i>

387
00:25:55.763 --> 00:25:58.682
<i>Come back this instant.
Don't you dare dawdle.</i>


388
00:25:58.849 --> 00:26:01.727
What happened?
- Clean this up, quick.


389
00:26:01.894 --> 00:26:04.730
But I'm off now. 
My shift is over.

390
00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:06.857
We can hit the road too.

391
00:26:07.024 --> 00:26:08.943
How will we transport all this?

392
00:26:10.861 --> 00:26:12.780
Piece of cake. 
The Elfie way.

393
00:26:12.947 --> 00:26:15.950
I feel naked without a hat.
I'm not going anywhere.


394
00:26:21.914 --> 00:26:22.998
Here we go.

395
00:26:33.801 --> 00:26:34.760
That's enough!

396
00:26:34.927 --> 00:26:35.970
Watch out, Frieda.

397
00:26:37.930 --> 00:26:38.931
This is so much fun!

398
00:26:44.770 --> 00:26:45.896
Out of the way!

399
00:26:53.904 --> 00:26:55.906
We're back!

400
00:26:56.907 --> 00:26:59.785
We got you new ingredients.
- Ta-da!


401
00:26:59.952 --> 00:27:02.746
Plus other great things, like fart beans.

402
00:27:02.913 --> 00:27:03.914
Where did you get all this?

403
00:27:04.081 --> 00:27:08.711
From a giant pantry.
You've never seen anything like it.


404
00:27:08.878 --> 00:27:11.922
Are we friends again?
Now it's time to save your bakery!


405
00:27:12.882 --> 00:27:13.966
Stop. Don't.

406
00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:17.845
It's your choice: bake it or leg it.

407
00:27:21.891 --> 00:27:22.892
Fine.

408
00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:30.024
Baking apprentice Elfie reporting for duty,
Master Baker.


409
00:27:31.025 --> 00:27:34.945
Fine. First we'll need strawberries
from the garden.


410
00:27:38.866 --> 00:27:40.910
Hey.
- He tricked us.


411
00:27:42.036 --> 00:27:44.997
Hey! Don't you dare start without us.

412
00:27:45.915 --> 00:27:47.041
That's humans for you.

413
00:27:47.833 --> 00:27:49.835
Sneaky and ungrateful.

414
00:27:55.925 --> 00:27:57.885
I want to bake like you.

415
00:28:05.017 --> 00:28:08.979
Let get something straight.
Elfkins have always helped humans.


416
00:28:09.146 --> 00:28:10.940
Now it's your turn to help us.

417
00:28:11.106 --> 00:28:12.858
No one has ever helped me.

418
00:28:13.025 --> 00:28:15.903
I'm not surprised. 
A sourpuss like you...

419
00:28:17.112 --> 00:28:18.948
Can't catch me!

420
00:28:19.990 --> 00:28:21.075
Wrong one.

421
00:28:22.076 --> 00:28:23.786
Over here.

422
00:28:23.953 --> 00:28:24.995
Wrong again.

423
00:28:27.998 --> 00:28:29.041
<i>Loser'.</i>

424
00:28:32.002 --> 00:28:33.087
Jackpou

425
00:28:42.054 --> 00:28:45.099
I'm not going anywhere
until you've taught me to bake.


426
00:28:48.978 --> 00:28:51.981
That's blackmail, you little pest.

427
00:28:52.898 --> 00:28:54.900
I think that means yes.

428
00:28:55.067 --> 00:28:57.861
Afterwards, I want you gone.
- I promise.


429
00:28:58.028 --> 00:28:59.989
Cross my Elfkin heart.

430
00:29:01.115 --> 00:29:02.116
We will.

431
00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:04.827
Fine, you can give me a hand.

432
00:29:04.994 --> 00:29:07.830
Get me flour, sugar, butter, vanilla extract.
- Okay.


433
00:29:07.997 --> 00:29:09.081
What are you waiting for?

434
00:29:15.963 --> 00:29:19.008
It's not my fault.
I need Elfkin-sized tools.


435
00:29:24.972 --> 00:29:28.017
Vendla was right.
Humans are bossy and arrogant.


436
00:29:28.183 --> 00:29:32.938
Destroying your master's store
is very, very naughty!


437
00:29:33.105 --> 00:29:36.942
Take that thing out of your mouth
when I'm scolding you.


438
00:29:41.989 --> 00:29:43.073
Not again!

439
00:29:47.036 --> 00:29:48.954
The ovens are overheating.

440
00:29:49.121 --> 00:29:51.040
We need to fix the control system.

441
00:29:51.206 --> 00:29:53.000
There's no rush.

442
00:29:53.167 --> 00:29:55.878
We'll all be blown into the air!

443
00:29:56.045 --> 00:29:58.047
We really need that new factory.

444
00:29:59.006 --> 00:30:01.967
In one week, we'll start with construction.

445
00:30:03.135 --> 00:30:05.137
She's a real beauty.

446
00:30:06.055 --> 00:30:09.183
What if your brother
can pay off his debts after all?


447
00:30:16.148 --> 00:30:21.028
As my father used to say,
"You have to love what you bake."


448
00:30:26.992 --> 00:30:30.913
For that, you need a gentle touch.

449
00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:32.164
A gentle touch, got it.

450
00:30:43.217 --> 00:30:45.177
You need patience too.

451
00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:50.099
Only a bit, though.

452
00:30:59.191 --> 00:31:02.111
And precision.

453
00:31:04.113 --> 00:31:06.073
Pre... what?

454
00:31:07.116 --> 00:31:10.035
Can I do some baking now too?
- No.


455
00:31:12.037 --> 00:31:13.247
But we had a deal.

456
00:31:14.039 --> 00:31:14.998
Hold your horses.

457
00:31:15.165 --> 00:31:18.085
I said you can give
me a hand, that's all.

458
00:31:19.253 --> 00:31:23.173
<i>"I'll</i> be a pastry chef
and win the biggest hat ever."


459
00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:25.134
Just you wait!

460
00:31:30.222 --> 00:31:33.100
Hey, I can't work like this.

461
00:31:36.270 --> 00:31:38.188
Baking is so fun!

462
00:31:39.273 --> 00:31:43.110
It's floury in here.
- Not another word. Got it?


463
00:31:44.069 --> 00:31:47.156
Got it?
- You said we couldn't talk.


464
00:31:48.282 --> 00:31:50.033
We've got it.

465
00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:53.287
I thought you wanted to learn how to bake.
- You won't let me.


466
00:31:54.079 --> 00:31:56.081
Learn to use your hands first.

467
00:31:56.290 --> 00:31:59.251
Maybe then I'll show you
how to bake from the heart.


468
00:32:00.127 --> 00:32:02.129
Now get to work.
- Okay.


469
00:32:18.103 --> 00:32:19.313
Enough. It's my bedtime.

470
00:32:22.149 --> 00:32:23.358
You clean the kitchen.

471
00:32:43.212 --> 00:32:45.339
Finished. It's spick and span.

472
00:32:46.131 --> 00:32:48.175
Can we sleep here?
- No.


473
00:32:48.342 --> 00:32:50.135
No way.

474
00:32:53.138 --> 00:32:54.264
Just this once.

475
00:32:56.183 --> 00:32:59.269
I think sourpuss is a lot nicer
than he seems.


476
00:32:59.436 --> 00:33:03.232
Humans often seem nice.
Then all of sudden they turn mean.


477
00:33:03.398 --> 00:33:07.152
What do you know about humans,
Mr. Pea-brain?


478
00:33:07.319 --> 00:33:09.363
Call me a pea-brain one more time...

479
00:33:10.155 --> 00:33:12.074
If that's what you want.

480
00:33:12.241 --> 00:33:14.284
Pea-brain.
- Tiny hat-wearer.


481
00:33:19.206 --> 00:33:21.250
No, don't. We'll be quiet.

482
00:33:21.416 --> 00:33:24.211
I told you. Humans are mean.

483
00:33:24.378 --> 00:33:27.297
What's going on? 
Are we on a boat?

484
00:33:33.178 --> 00:33:34.304
Just great.

485
00:33:35.347 --> 00:33:37.391
Let's see if we can find a lantern.

486
00:33:38.225 --> 00:33:40.352
What for? There's one in the sky.

487
00:33:44.398 --> 00:33:47.359
If only the others could see this.

488
00:33:54.283 --> 00:33:56.201
Look!
- Amazing!


489
00:33:56.368 --> 00:33:58.370
I'm fine, thanks for asking.

490
00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:08.297
Incredible!

491
00:34:24.271 --> 00:34:25.355
Hello.

492
00:34:26.398 --> 00:34:28.233
Sorry.

493
00:34:37.242 --> 00:34:40.287
We didn't touch much.
- It's so pretty.


494
00:34:42.331 --> 00:34:43.457
The Moon Song.

495
00:34:44.374 --> 00:34:47.336
Bruno and I used to
listen to it every night.

496
00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:51.256
Why don't you get along anymore?

497
00:34:52.299 --> 00:34:54.259
It's a sad story.

498
00:34:54.426 --> 00:34:56.261
Tell us!
- No.


499
00:34:56.428 --> 00:34:59.348
I want to sleep.
- But we know where you sleep...


500
00:35:02.351 --> 00:35:04.436
Okay, okay! Fine.

501
00:35:07.439 --> 00:35:10.359
We used to be the perfect team.

502
00:35:11.318 --> 00:35:13.487
I'd sneak into Dad's kitchen
at night to bake.


503
00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:18.450
Bruno would sell everything
to the kids living nearby.


504
00:35:19.326 --> 00:35:21.411
They were crazy for my cupcakes,

505
00:35:21.578 --> 00:35:24.498
and Bruno was a brilliant salesman.

506
00:35:26.333 --> 00:35:28.377
We spent our earnings on toys.

507
00:35:28.543 --> 00:35:31.380
Boy, it was a true paradise.

508
00:35:32.506 --> 00:35:36.259
At night, I'd write
new recipes in my notebook,


509
00:35:36.426 --> 00:35:40.430
and Bruno would stuff our earnings
into our little treasure chest.


510
00:35:44.559 --> 00:35:47.229
Anyway, that was long ago.

511
00:35:47.396 --> 00:35:50.273
Hey, but what about the sad part?

512
00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:52.484
Finish the story.
- Please!


513
00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:54.403
You little pests.

514
00:35:56.530 --> 00:36:01.326
It began with
the International Confectionary Championship.


515
00:36:01.493 --> 00:36:05.414
I was the youngest person ever to win.
Dad was so proud of me.


516
00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:08.542
And Bruno was jealous?
- Yes.


517
00:36:09.501 --> 00:36:11.545
That was the end of our dream team.

518
00:36:12.546 --> 00:36:15.340
When Dad died,
Bruno wanted to close the store


519
00:36:15.507 --> 00:36:17.259
and build a factory.

520
00:36:17.426 --> 00:36:18.510
Conveyor belt cakes!

521
00:36:20.345 --> 00:36:21.388
Baking is an art form.

522
00:36:21.555 --> 00:36:25.392
Theo Hampus will never
work behind an assembly line.


523
00:36:25.559 --> 00:36:29.396
Things spiraled out of control.
Bruno upped and left.


524
00:36:29.563 --> 00:36:33.525
Soon after, he built
that ugly building right opposite.


525
00:36:34.484 --> 00:36:38.488
He's left me a poor baker,
while he's a wealthy sleazebag.


526
00:36:39.573 --> 00:36:41.491
That's the whole story.

527
00:36:41.658 --> 00:36:44.494
Now go to sleep.
We're getting up early.


528
00:36:58.467 --> 00:36:59.509
Yes!

529
00:37:03.555 --> 00:37:05.474
Buck! Kipp!

530
00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:07.601
It's time to start baking.

531
00:37:08.518 --> 00:37:11.438
How do you propose
we use all those heavy machines?


532
00:37:11.605 --> 00:37:14.483
That's where you come into it, pea-brain.

533
00:37:17.569 --> 00:37:20.489
What do you say?
It's incredible, right?


534
00:37:34.586 --> 00:37:36.671
We built you this crazy machine

535
00:37:37.589 --> 00:37:40.425
And now it's time for you to see

536
00:37:40.592 --> 00:37:43.428
With Elfkin-skill and Elfie-power

537
00:37:43.595 --> 00:37:46.473
We'll become the masters of the flour

538
00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:49.518
Mixing bowls clatter,
we're in the zone


539
00:37:49.684 --> 00:37:52.479
Elfie-chaos takes control

540
00:37:52.646 --> 00:37:55.649
We know the tricks that really stick

541
00:37:56.483 --> 00:37:58.485
And you can't help but think it's fantastic

542
00:37:58.652 --> 00:38:01.571
Now don't become flustered
This is super-Elfienesque!


543
00:38:01.738 --> 00:38:04.699
'Cause me Kipp and Buck
are simply the best


544
00:38:05.450 --> 00:38:06.493
That's Elfkin style

545
00:38:06.660 --> 00:38:07.577
Yeah, yeah, yeah

546
00:38:07.744 --> 00:38:09.579
Yeah, that's Elfkin style

547
00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:13.667
That's Elfkin style
yeah, yeah, yeah


548
00:38:14.459 --> 00:38:15.585
Yeah, that's Elfkin style

549
00:38:18.672 --> 00:38:20.549
That's Elfkin style

550
00:38:23.635 --> 00:38:26.555
We're sweeping through the bakery,
the wind of change is blowing


551
00:38:26.721 --> 00:38:29.558
Put the pedal to the metal
'cause when the Elfkin show is showing


552
00:38:29.724 --> 00:38:32.686
We do everything we can
'cause that is what we do


553
00:38:33.478 --> 00:38:35.522
Once the Elfkin ball is rolling
we cannot be stopped!


554
00:38:35.689 --> 00:38:38.608
Yo, we be bakin' up a storm,
we ain't beatin' around the bush


555
00:38:38.775 --> 00:38:42.404
Elfie, Kipp and Buck are baking
swift and smart and swoosh


556
00:38:42.571 --> 00:38:43.613
That's Elfkin style

557
00:38:45.574 --> 00:38:48.410
We do it right
You can count on us completely


558
00:38:48.577 --> 00:38:51.496
This is Elfkin style
Yeah, yeah, yeah


559
00:38:51.663 --> 00:38:52.747
Yeah, that's Elfkin style

560
00:38:54.624 --> 00:38:57.544
That's Elfkin style
Yeah, yeah, yeah


561
00:38:57.711 --> 00:38:59.504
We do it right

562
00:39:00.714 --> 00:39:03.550
This is Elfkin style
Yeah, yeah, yeah


563
00:39:04.509 --> 00:39:06.636
Ready, set and go!

564
00:39:07.554 --> 00:39:08.763
Kipp invented it all.

565
00:39:09.514 --> 00:39:11.558
He's got more in his pea brain
that you'd think.


566
00:39:11.725 --> 00:39:13.560
Piece of cake.

567
00:39:18.607 --> 00:39:19.649
You're all nutty,

568
00:39:21.651 --> 00:39:23.486
and I like it.

569
00:39:23.653 --> 00:39:25.572
Now it's time to save your bakery.

570
00:39:27.574 --> 00:39:29.576
Try this.
- Too much sugar.


571
00:39:29.743 --> 00:39:32.746
Is it better now?
- Stir it for longer.


572
00:39:33.747 --> 00:39:35.540
More cinnamon.

573
00:39:36.708 --> 00:39:40.670
What are you doing there?
- I'm not ready yet. Don't look.


574
00:39:42.589 --> 00:39:44.549
Your cakes are really tasty,

575
00:39:44.716 --> 00:39:47.594
but we need to make this place
so much "Elfier!"


576
00:39:57.562 --> 00:39:58.730
Good thing Elfkins are here to help.

577
00:40:01.733 --> 00:40:03.652
What does this thing do?

578
00:40:09.658 --> 00:40:10.659
Again!

579
00:40:41.648 --> 00:40:42.816
I'm ready now.

580
00:40:51.616 --> 00:40:53.827
You told us
you have to love what you bake.


581
00:40:59.624 --> 00:41:02.627
Well? What do you think?

582
00:41:04.671 --> 00:41:05.797
You're doing it on purpose.

583
00:41:09.634 --> 00:41:11.636
I didn't think you had it in you.

584
00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:18.685
It's just like it used to be.

585
00:41:19.728 --> 00:41:20.854
But even better.

586
00:41:23.857 --> 00:41:27.694
We just cleaned the floor.
- Leave him alone.


587
00:41:27.861 --> 00:41:30.697
I told you we'd do it Elfkin style.

588
00:41:31.698 --> 00:41:32.657
You really did.

589
00:41:32.824 --> 00:41:36.661
You're small, but when it comes to helping,
you're the greatest.


590
00:41:36.828 --> 00:41:37.829
Wait a minute.

591
00:41:42.751 --> 00:41:44.711
What a cool lightning machine.

592
00:41:52.927 --> 00:41:54.888
It's time to open the bakery.

593
00:41:55.764 --> 00:41:56.723
Come in, everyone.

594
00:41:56.890 --> 00:41:58.683
So soon?

595
00:41:59.809 --> 00:42:00.894
Hey, you have to smile.

596
00:42:03.855 --> 00:42:04.939
Like this.

597
00:42:05.690 --> 00:42:06.816
No, even more!

598
00:42:06.983 --> 00:42:08.777
Come and help.
Like this.


599
00:42:08.943 --> 00:42:10.779
Now stay like that.

600
00:42:15.867 --> 00:42:17.786
Why isn't anyone coming?

601
00:42:17.952 --> 00:42:20.914
Well, the store has been closed for years.

602
00:42:22.749 --> 00:42:25.710
They'll come soon enough.
- Definitely!


603
00:42:31.925 --> 00:42:34.719
No one remembers me.

604
00:42:38.765 --> 00:42:39.891
We can change that.

605
00:42:44.938 --> 00:42:46.856
Load up.

606
00:42:53.905 --> 00:42:55.740
All aboard.

607
00:42:55.990 --> 00:42:57.951
Fart rocket ready for takeoff.

608
00:42:58.910 --> 00:43:01.830
This plan is much too Elfienesque for me.

609
00:43:01.996 --> 00:43:03.873
Trust me, you get used to it.

610
00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:10.004
I've forgotten something...

611
00:43:21.933 --> 00:43:23.852
UP We go!

612
00:43:29.983 --> 00:43:31.901
You're doing great, Kipp!

613
00:43:51.796 --> 00:43:54.883
Look at that.
- What's that?


614
00:43:55.049 --> 00:43:57.927
Huge snowflakes!
- No, flying muffins.


615
00:44:00.013 --> 00:44:02.807
There's writing on it! 
What does it say?

616
00:44:02.974 --> 00:44:04.726
"Hampus Bakery."

617
00:44:04.893 --> 00:44:07.770
It's mine!
-"Tomorrow at ten, grand re-opening."


618
00:44:07.937 --> 00:44:09.814
Give it to me!

619
00:44:14.861 --> 00:44:16.821
Come to Rosa!

620
00:44:16.988 --> 00:44:19.824
I'll eat my hat if this doesn't work.

621
00:44:24.871 --> 00:44:25.914
What is that?

622
00:44:26.998 --> 00:44:29.000
Stop the car!

623
00:44:35.006 --> 00:44:36.925
Finally!

624
00:44:37.091 --> 00:44:40.011
Elfie, now I know what I forgot.

625
00:44:40.929 --> 00:44:42.013
The brakes!

626
00:44:49.854 --> 00:44:50.855
Are you okay?

627
00:44:51.022 --> 00:44:53.858
It's the test phase.
- We'll go again tomorrow!


628
00:44:54.025 --> 00:44:55.026
Out of the question.

629
00:44:55.860 --> 00:44:56.986
Why not?

630
00:44:58.029 --> 00:44:59.113
Because...

631
00:44:59.864 --> 00:45:02.909
I was worried about you little nincompoops.

632
00:45:03.868 --> 00:45:06.079
Because you like us, Mr. Sourpuss?

633
00:45:06.871 --> 00:45:08.831
I wouldn't put it like that.

634
00:45:08.998 --> 00:45:10.959
Fine, fine. Darn it!

635
00:45:11.918 --> 00:45:13.962
As human's go, he's pretty okay.

636
00:45:15.964 --> 00:45:18.007
What... What was that?

637
00:45:20.969 --> 00:45:22.053
Yummy!

638
00:45:27.016 --> 00:45:30.061
How did that loser
turn things around so fast?


639
00:45:35.149 --> 00:45:37.110
Are you sure about this, boss?

640
00:45:38.987 --> 00:45:40.071
Quiet!

641
00:45:50.039 --> 00:45:54.085
This is our...
- This is so scrumptious.


642
00:46:02.093 --> 00:46:04.012
This used to be mine.

643
00:46:06.180 --> 00:46:08.016
I don't believe it.

644
00:46:08.933 --> 00:46:12.020
He made all this using our old toys.

645
00:46:24.073 --> 00:46:26.034
We'll be nice and quiet.

646
00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:27.952
She means we'll try.

647
00:46:32.165 --> 00:46:34.167
Careful.
- Get out!


648
00:46:35.043 --> 00:46:36.961
This is my bakery.

649
00:46:37.128 --> 00:46:39.964
And this is my bulldozer!
You can't use it.


650
00:46:40.131 --> 00:46:42.091
I can use anything
I want in my house.

651
00:46:44.177 --> 00:46:46.054
It's my house too.

652
00:46:46.220 --> 00:46:48.056
All of a sudden?

653
00:46:48.222 --> 00:46:51.893
You always said the bakery
was too small and pokey.


654
00:46:52.060 --> 00:46:53.936
You wanted to put it up for sale.

655
00:46:54.103 --> 00:46:56.105
We were in debt up to our noses.

656
00:46:58.149 --> 00:47:02.028
Fancy baking isn't enough.
Selling is an art form too.


657
00:47:02.195 --> 00:47:05.031
But you and Dad never understood that.

658
00:47:06.032 --> 00:47:07.909
You had your moment of glory.

659
00:47:08.076 --> 00:47:10.078
The youngest champion ever!

660
00:47:10.244 --> 00:47:11.996
Dad's pride and joy.

661
00:47:13.206 --> 00:47:15.958
You had to go and ruin everything.

662
00:47:16.125 --> 00:47:20.129
Now you and this ramshackle place
will make space for my factory.


663
00:47:24.133 --> 00:47:25.218
We have to help Theo.

664
00:47:28.179 --> 00:47:31.015
I'm not ready to meet my maker.

665
00:47:31.224 --> 00:47:33.267
Remember the legend?

666
00:47:38.231 --> 00:47:39.273
The tailor's wife's trick?

667
00:47:44.112 --> 00:47:45.196
Now!

668
00:47:51.035 --> 00:47:53.037
No! That wasn't supposed to happen.

669
00:47:53.204 --> 00:47:55.164
Theo! Theo, wake up.

670
00:47:56.040 --> 00:47:57.166
Theo!
- Quick, hide.


671
00:48:03.131 --> 00:48:04.215
He's alive.

672
00:48:05.216 --> 00:48:07.135
But it doesn't look good.

673
00:48:08.177 --> 00:48:10.054
Call an ambulance.

674
00:48:12.056 --> 00:48:13.224
His old recipe book.

675
00:48:18.229 --> 00:48:20.106
He needs to rest now.

676
00:48:20.273 --> 00:48:23.276
He has a severe concussion.
They're giving him a sedative.


677
00:48:24.110 --> 00:48:26.237
He'll have to stay
here for a few days.

678
00:48:27.113 --> 00:48:29.115
It looks like his shop has had it.

679
00:48:29.282 --> 00:48:31.284
I didn't want it to happen like this.

680
00:48:42.211 --> 00:48:44.255
Theo, could you please wake up?

681
00:48:45.173 --> 00:48:46.174
It's important.

682
00:48:48.176 --> 00:48:50.094
Look, he's waking up.

683
00:48:50.261 --> 00:48:52.346
Oh my, three garden gnomes.

684
00:48:53.222 --> 00:48:54.223
You're walking on thin ice!

685
00:48:54.390 --> 00:48:57.143
No, it's me, Elfie!

686
00:48:58.186 --> 00:49:00.271
Talking garden gnomes.

687
00:49:03.149 --> 00:49:05.234
No, don't go to sleep, Theo!

688
00:49:05.401 --> 00:49:07.278
Hey! Wake up!

689
00:49:08.154 --> 00:49:09.197
Wake up!

690
00:49:10.114 --> 00:49:11.199
Come on.

691
00:49:11.365 --> 00:49:13.242
Wake up.
- Forget it.


692
00:49:14.160 --> 00:49:16.204
When someone his size conks out...

693
00:49:16.370 --> 00:49:20.249
When he wakes up,
his bakery will be gone.

694
00:49:28.341 --> 00:49:30.134
What are you doing?

695
00:49:30.301 --> 00:49:31.219
Saving the bakery.

696
00:49:31.385 --> 00:49:34.347
Just the three of us?
She's delusional.


697
00:49:36.182 --> 00:49:37.183
I'll get us help.

698
00:49:37.350 --> 00:49:40.186
The bakery opens at 10 o'clock.
We have time.


699
00:49:40.353 --> 00:49:43.231
No human would ever help an Elfkin.

700
00:49:43.397 --> 00:49:45.107
I'm not asking the humans.

701
00:49:45.274 --> 00:49:46.234
I'm enlisting the others.

702
00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:49.403
Theo said it himself.
We're the greatest at helping.


703
00:49:51.197 --> 00:49:52.323
If Bruno shows up...

704
00:49:56.410 --> 00:49:58.329
We'll take care of him.

705
00:50:05.253 --> 00:50:07.129
You'd better come back.

706
00:50:07.296 --> 00:50:08.339
Be careful.

707
00:50:17.306 --> 00:50:18.349
Hey!

708
00:50:30.194 --> 00:50:32.405
Hey! Where is everyone?

709
00:50:33.281 --> 00:50:34.282
Hello?

710
00:50:50.464 --> 00:50:54.343
Let us always remember
Kipp, Buck and Elfie.


711
00:50:54.510 --> 00:50:56.262
Wherever their souls are,

712
00:50:56.429 --> 00:50:59.181
may they always have
a warm hat on their heads.


713
00:50:59.348 --> 00:51:00.349
We do!

714
00:51:02.268 --> 00:51:03.436
Don't worry about that.

715
00:51:04.312 --> 00:51:06.355
Elfie! We thought you were...

716
00:51:07.273 --> 00:51:08.232
Where have you been?

717
00:51:08.399 --> 00:51:10.234
Elfie!
- Up there, with the humans.


718
00:51:10.401 --> 00:51:13.237
She's totally lost it.
- Where are Buck and Kipp?


719
00:51:13.404 --> 00:51:15.281
Looking after Theo's bakery.

720
00:51:15.448 --> 00:51:16.282
Who's that?

721
00:51:16.449 --> 00:51:18.284
Theo's a human being.

722
00:51:19.327 --> 00:51:23.289
One of the good ones.
He taught me to bake.


723
00:51:23.456 --> 00:51:26.375
You can eat them. Try!
- Really?


724
00:51:29.337 --> 00:51:30.338
Take it.

725
00:51:35.343 --> 00:51:38.346
I made them myself. 
I'm a baker now.

726
00:51:39.388 --> 00:51:40.348
That may be the case,

727
00:51:40.514 --> 00:51:42.391
but you'll get the others right now,

728
00:51:42.558 --> 00:51:45.519
and then we'll never
speak about this again.


729
00:51:46.270 --> 00:51:47.396
I don't think so!

730
00:51:47.563 --> 00:51:51.192
You have to come with me.
I have a plan...


731
00:51:51.359 --> 00:51:55.279
Little one, your plans
are usually pretty dangerous.


732
00:51:55.529 --> 00:51:58.199
But Theo needs our help.

733
00:51:58.366 --> 00:52:01.369
If he can't manage alone, that's his problem.

734
00:52:01.535 --> 00:52:05.289
But helping is what
we do best, isn't it?

735
00:52:05.456 --> 00:52:07.375
Says who?

736
00:52:07.541 --> 00:52:09.377
Theo and me.

737
00:52:10.336 --> 00:52:13.255
Dratted hat, don't you get it?

738
00:52:13.422 --> 00:52:15.341
Helping is our real purpose in life.

739
00:52:15.508 --> 00:52:18.511
Not how well we
build chairs or dye shoes.

740
00:52:19.303 --> 00:52:20.221
Hush!

741
00:52:20.388 --> 00:52:23.391
Not even how well we bake.
We forgot our real purpose.


742
00:52:23.557 --> 00:52:27.311
We Elfkins are the only ones
who can help Theo.


743
00:52:27.478 --> 00:52:28.479
So what do you say?

744
00:52:35.319 --> 00:52:37.321
Nothing's going to change.

745
00:52:37.488 --> 00:52:40.366
They stay up there, we stay down here.

746
00:53:03.556 --> 00:53:06.392
I really wanted to help you.

747
00:53:06.559 --> 00:53:09.270
It sounded so easy in the legend.

748
00:53:09.437 --> 00:53:12.398
You humans sleep,
while we do it Elfkin style.


749
00:53:15.443 --> 00:53:19.363
I guess I'll never be a real Elfkin.

750
00:53:22.408 --> 00:53:23.451
Hold on.

751
00:53:23.617 --> 00:53:25.578
The jury is still out on that.

752
00:53:27.455 --> 00:53:30.416
They showed up in the bakery
all of a sudden.


753
00:53:30.583 --> 00:53:33.627
It was easy to find.
We followed the smell of your cakes.


754
00:53:34.628 --> 00:53:37.465
We don't want people saying we Elfkins

755
00:53:37.631 --> 00:53:40.384
don't help one another.

756
00:53:40.551 --> 00:53:41.469
My goodness,

757
00:53:41.635 --> 00:53:45.514
humans are even bigger and uglier
than I thought.


758
00:53:46.474 --> 00:53:48.309
Fine. We'll help you.

759
00:53:48.476 --> 00:53:49.643
But there's one condition.

760
00:53:50.478 --> 00:53:54.482
When we've finished,
we're leaving and never coming back.


761
00:53:55.399 --> 00:53:57.443
That goes for you too, Elfie.

762
00:54:01.572 --> 00:54:03.616
So what's your plan?

763
00:54:04.533 --> 00:54:06.535
We need Theo to make it work.

764
00:54:09.538 --> 00:54:12.416
Push!
- Left!


765
00:54:15.628 --> 00:54:17.463
More left.

766
00:54:17.630 --> 00:54:19.423
Right!

767
00:54:36.565 --> 00:54:37.650
Now what?

768
00:54:38.609 --> 00:54:41.362
Now we bake till our hats are smoking.

769
00:54:41.529 --> 00:54:43.405
Theo will sell what we make.

770
00:54:43.572 --> 00:54:45.407
Come on. He's just a human.

771
00:54:45.574 --> 00:54:47.576
A harmless human.
- I'm not sure...


772
00:54:48.577 --> 00:54:50.454
See? He wouldn't hurt a fly.

773
00:54:55.501 --> 00:54:59.547
How will this snoozing monster
ever sell anything?


774
00:54:59.713 --> 00:55:01.674
You must be crazy.

775
00:55:02.716 --> 00:55:04.510
If you say so.

776
00:55:04.677 --> 00:55:06.679
But just you wait until the show starts!

777
00:55:07.638 --> 00:55:10.474
One, two, one, two, one, two...

778
00:55:15.646 --> 00:55:17.481
Out of the way.

779
00:55:18.691 --> 00:55:20.568
Good job!

780
00:55:21.652 --> 00:55:23.529
You have to stir longer.

781
00:55:32.663 --> 00:55:34.540
What do you think?

782
00:55:45.509 --> 00:55:48.637
Harriet, order the bulldozer.
It's showtime.


783
00:55:53.601 --> 00:55:56.645
Quick, everyone take your positions.

784
00:55:58.647 --> 00:55:59.690
Hello?

785
00:56:00.566 --> 00:56:01.609
Is anyone here?

786
00:56:10.743 --> 00:56:12.661
Beautiful.

787
00:56:19.543 --> 00:56:20.711
Focus!

788
00:56:23.547 --> 00:56:26.675
Welcome to my little shop of wonders.

789
00:56:26.842 --> 00:56:28.636
What can I get you?

790
00:56:29.678 --> 00:56:30.763
Lemon fish?

791
00:56:31.722 --> 00:56:33.557
Elfkin hats?

792
00:56:33.724 --> 00:56:35.684
Or would you prefer the moon?

793
00:56:40.689 --> 00:56:43.609
Wonderful. I'll take them all.
- Really?


794
00:56:43.776 --> 00:56:46.695
I mean, that's a brilliant decision.

795
00:56:48.697 --> 00:56:49.782
Thank you.

796
00:56:50.699 --> 00:56:54.745
Have a nice day, Madame.
Be sure to recommend us.


797
00:56:55.788 --> 00:56:57.623
It worked!

798
00:57:32.616 --> 00:57:34.827
Ladies and gentleman,
and now for our specialty:


799
00:57:35.661 --> 00:57:36.745
cream spires!

800
00:57:37.705 --> 00:57:39.623
Cream spires!

801
00:57:43.794 --> 00:57:46.714
What's wrong with him?
- Good heavens?


802
00:57:49.717 --> 00:57:50.843
A work of art.

803
00:57:53.721 --> 00:57:56.724
In my dream, you were tiny
and wearing funny hats.


804
00:57:56.890 --> 00:57:58.851
What now?
- Get them out. Quick.


805
00:58:00.644 --> 00:58:02.730
Ladies and gentleman, the show is done.

806
00:58:02.896 --> 00:58:03.856
Hope you had fun.

807
00:58:04.815 --> 00:58:08.652
It must be part of the performance.
- Is it over already?


808
00:58:08.861 --> 00:58:10.696
Don't go!

809
00:58:10.863 --> 00:58:12.823
No, it's time to go home!

810
00:58:13.866 --> 00:58:15.868
I'll bring my wife tomorrow.

811
00:58:18.746 --> 00:58:19.830
What's going on?

812
00:58:20.748 --> 00:58:22.583
My bakery?

813
00:58:22.750 --> 00:58:23.792
Is this my bakery?

814
00:58:23.959 --> 00:58:27.713
You bet.
We're going to make sure it stays that way.


815
00:58:27.880 --> 00:58:29.798
But... how did you...

816
00:58:30.799 --> 00:58:33.719
We had a little help.
May I introduce...


817
00:58:33.886 --> 00:58:35.679
My friends!
- You're the best!


818
00:58:35.846 --> 00:58:37.723
You all...

819
00:58:38.724 --> 00:58:40.809
You really are the greatest. Thanks.

820
00:58:40.976 --> 00:58:42.811
Thank you so much.
- No big deal.


821
00:58:43.812 --> 00:58:45.898
The glass baking line.

822
00:58:46.774 --> 00:58:47.816
It should have four lanes!

823
00:58:47.983 --> 00:58:50.652
Actually, let's make it eight.

824
00:58:50.819 --> 00:58:51.904
Eight baking lanes.

825
00:58:53.864 --> 00:58:54.907
We're even.

826
00:58:55.908 --> 00:58:58.869
I don't want to see
you in my bakery again.

827
00:59:00.704 --> 00:59:01.914
But he was in hospital...

828
00:59:03.707 --> 00:59:04.792
What'?

829
00:59:06.835 --> 00:59:08.670
The hat!

830
00:59:08.837 --> 00:59:09.755
So it wasn't a rat.

831
00:59:09.922 --> 00:59:10.839
It was garden gnomes.

832
00:59:11.006 --> 00:59:12.758
Garden gnomes?

833
00:59:12.925 --> 00:59:15.636
Those are Elfkins.

834
00:59:15.803 --> 00:59:17.805
My brother has Elfkins!

835
00:59:17.971 --> 00:59:19.848
It's not fair.

836
00:59:20.849 --> 00:59:22.851
They raided my store.

837
00:59:23.018 --> 00:59:24.812
They're criminals.

838
00:59:26.730 --> 00:59:28.816
Now it's time to celebrate!

839
00:59:30.901 --> 00:59:32.903
Where is everyone?

840
00:59:35.948 --> 00:59:37.783
What's wrong?

841
00:59:38.826 --> 00:59:40.702
I have to go, Theo.

842
00:59:40.869 --> 00:59:41.829
Nonsense!

843
00:59:41.995 --> 00:59:44.665
Forget about our silly deal.

844
00:59:44.832 --> 00:59:45.874
It's expired.

845
00:59:46.041 --> 00:59:48.794
You don't have to go.
- But I do.


846
00:59:48.961 --> 00:59:50.879
That's how it works with Elfkins.

847
00:59:51.046 --> 00:59:53.924
When our work is
done, we have to go.

848
00:59:54.842 --> 00:59:56.885
But there's still so much to bake.

849
00:59:57.052 --> 01:00:00.764
Strawberry and ginger cakes.
Marshmallow cookies...


850
01:00:00.931 --> 01:00:02.808
with melted chocolate!

851
01:00:03.767 --> 01:00:04.935
Please stay.

852
01:00:05.978 --> 01:00:09.857
We need to make
this place so much "Elfier!"

853
01:00:10.816 --> 01:00:11.859
But I can't.

854
01:00:12.818 --> 01:00:13.902
I promised them I'd leave.

855
01:00:14.069 --> 01:00:15.696
But...

856
01:00:15.863 --> 01:00:16.822
But...

857
01:00:17.906 --> 01:00:20.868
You'd better not forget me, Mr. Sourpuss.

858
01:00:21.034 --> 01:00:22.786
I won't,

859
01:00:22.995 --> 01:00:24.913
you little pest.

860
01:00:25.789 --> 01:00:26.874
Oh, yes...

861
01:00:27.916 --> 01:00:29.960
I have a little something for you.

862
01:00:31.879 --> 01:00:32.921
For me?

863
01:00:33.088 --> 01:00:34.965
I've got my own hat!

864
01:00:35.799 --> 01:00:37.926
A really big one!

865
01:00:42.014 --> 01:00:43.849
Thank you.

866
01:00:46.977 --> 01:00:48.937
I'm going to miss you all.

867
01:00:53.025 --> 01:00:54.902
We'll miss you too.

868
01:00:55.903 --> 01:00:56.987
Bye.

869
01:01:03.952 --> 01:01:05.996
That's some hat.

870
01:01:07.873 --> 01:01:09.833
Congratulations, Elfie.

871
01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.836
It's time to go.
- Yes.


872
01:01:22.846 --> 01:01:24.848
Enough of the long face.

873
01:01:25.015 --> 01:01:27.017
I'm looking forward to your cakes.

874
01:01:32.898 --> 01:01:33.941
What's that?

875
01:01:34.107 --> 01:01:35.067
An animal?

876
01:01:36.068 --> 01:01:37.903
It's a contraption!

877
01:01:40.948 --> 01:01:42.032
Well done, Charles.

878
01:01:43.951 --> 01:01:46.119
No! Not my hat!

879
01:01:47.079 --> 01:01:49.915
They do look like garden gnomes.

880
01:01:50.082 --> 01:01:51.917
They're so cute. 
Can I have one?

881
01:01:52.084 --> 01:01:53.877
No. I still need them.

882
01:01:54.044 --> 01:01:56.922
When Theo finds out,
he'll knock your hat off.


883
01:01:57.089 --> 01:01:58.882
He's my friend.

884
01:01:59.049 --> 01:02:00.884
Your accomplice, you mean.

885
01:02:01.051 --> 01:02:03.095
You looted my store together.

886
01:02:04.096 --> 01:02:06.014
I'm not one to hold a grudge.

887
01:02:06.890 --> 01:02:11.061
I'm offering you a glorious future
in the world's most modern factory.


888
01:02:11.979 --> 01:02:13.897
You're going to love it.

889
01:02:14.064 --> 01:02:14.982
Dream on!

890
01:02:17.025 --> 01:02:18.026
He sure can.

891
01:02:18.944 --> 01:02:21.029
We're leaving. Let's go
- All together.


892
01:02:27.119 --> 01:02:29.037
Now lift it.

893
01:02:37.963 --> 01:02:38.964
Now what?

894
01:02:41.049 --> 01:02:42.009
There!

895
01:02:42.175 --> 01:02:44.094
We'll take the cable car.

896
01:02:56.189 --> 01:02:58.108
I can taste freedom!

897
01:02:59.985 --> 01:03:01.069
No, wrong direction.

898
01:03:13.165 --> 01:03:16.001
Nice try. You're staying here.

899
01:03:49.993 --> 01:03:51.078
Brother dearest!

900
01:03:52.162 --> 01:03:55.999
I've always wanted to drive one of these.
Remember?


901
01:03:56.166 --> 01:03:58.168
Hey! I paid off my debt.

902
01:03:59.044 --> 01:04:00.087
By stealing from me.

903
01:04:00.253 --> 01:04:01.129
That doesn't count.

904
01:04:01.296 --> 01:04:05.008
I know all about
your criminal little friends.


905
01:04:05.175 --> 01:04:07.135
Get them on screen, Harriet.

906
01:04:13.183 --> 01:04:15.018
Let them go!

907
01:04:15.185 --> 01:04:16.186
They didn't hurt you.

908
01:04:17.104 --> 01:04:20.023
They robbed me blind
and destroyed my store.


909
01:04:20.190 --> 01:04:22.275
They'll be working in my new factory.

910
01:04:23.235 --> 01:04:24.277
Out of my way.

911
01:04:26.238 --> 01:04:28.115
And we're live.

912
01:04:28.281 --> 01:04:32.035
<i>They'd much rather work for me
than in your dump.</i>


913
01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:35.205
<i>Let them go,
and I'll get out of your way.</i>


914
01:04:36.123 --> 01:04:38.083
<i>Don't do it, Theo.
- Move!</i>


915
01:04:38.250 --> 01:04:42.212
I bet my hat he wouldn't
give up his bakery for us.


916
01:04:43.130 --> 01:04:45.298
You stubborn mule. 
Don't do this.

917
01:04:46.091 --> 01:04:48.093
Let them go,
or you'll have to drive over me.


918
01:04:48.260 --> 01:04:51.972
You were always like this.
Totally inflexible.


919
01:04:52.139 --> 01:04:54.266
Harriet, bring me those munchkins.

920
01:04:55.142 --> 01:04:56.268
They're Elfkins!

921
01:04:57.227 --> 01:04:58.979
Not munchkins.

922
01:04:59.146 --> 01:05:01.148
Theo! No! Don't do it.

923
01:05:01.314 --> 01:05:03.108
It'll have all been in vain!

924
01:05:06.278 --> 01:05:07.320
No!

925
01:05:09.114 --> 01:05:10.282
Harriet, get back inside!

926
01:05:11.074 --> 01:05:12.242
Got it. They don't go free.

927
01:05:13.243 --> 01:05:14.244
You double-crosser.

928
01:05:24.129 --> 01:05:25.172
Elfie!

929
01:05:29.176 --> 01:05:31.011
We have to stop Bruno.

930
01:05:31.178 --> 01:05:32.345
Elfie, come back.

931
01:05:38.310 --> 01:05:41.062
Stop it, jelly-belly!

932
01:05:41.229 --> 01:05:43.190
I'm driving a digger!

933
01:05:46.193 --> 01:05:47.194
Stay here.

934
01:05:48.361 --> 01:05:51.114
We won't repeat
the tale of the tailor's wife.


935
01:05:51.281 --> 01:05:53.325
This time we'll defend ourselves!

936
01:05:57.162 --> 01:05:58.205
I won't stand for this.

937
01:06:12.260 --> 01:06:14.346
Harriet, where are you?

938
01:06:15.138 --> 01:06:16.223
I've been held up!

939
01:06:16.389 --> 01:06:17.307
Follow me!

940
01:06:26.233 --> 01:06:27.317
Hey!

941
01:06:31.279 --> 01:06:33.198
Wrong direction!

942
01:06:42.290 --> 01:06:43.333
Elfie!

943
01:06:44.209 --> 01:06:45.210
Elfie?

944
01:06:45.377 --> 01:06:46.336
Elfie!

945
01:06:47.254 --> 01:06:48.338
Where are you?

946
01:06:55.178 --> 01:06:56.263
Here!

947
01:06:56.429 --> 01:06:58.223
Are you okay?

948
01:07:00.433 --> 01:07:02.435
Sorry. It tastes disgusting.

949
01:07:09.401 --> 01:07:10.402
Help.

950
01:07:11.194 --> 01:07:12.237
Help!

951
01:07:14.322 --> 01:07:15.365
Bruno!

952
01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:18.368
Bruno! Darn it!

953
01:07:19.286 --> 01:07:21.162
Help me, please.

954
01:07:21.329 --> 01:07:23.123
He doesn't really deserve it...

955
01:07:23.290 --> 01:07:24.416
Let's go. Elfkin ladder.

956
01:07:33.216 --> 01:07:35.302
I'm sinking!
- Stay with us.


957
01:07:39.347 --> 01:07:40.265
No!

958
01:07:40.432 --> 01:07:41.474
No!

959
01:07:44.477 --> 01:07:46.396
No, Elfie!

960
01:07:48.231 --> 01:07:49.357
Elfie.
- Where is she?


961
01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:51.401
Oh no!

962
01:08:04.456 --> 01:08:06.291
We got you!

963
01:08:14.382 --> 01:08:15.467
The old pin in the butt trick.

964
01:08:16.259 --> 01:08:18.345
Amazing.
- You saved my life.


965
01:08:20.305 --> 01:08:22.223
You all helped me.

966
01:08:22.390 --> 01:08:24.351
That's just what we do.

967
01:08:25.352 --> 01:08:26.478
What's going on now?

968
01:08:29.356 --> 01:08:32.275
The place is about to explode.

969
01:08:42.369 --> 01:08:43.411
No!

970
01:08:44.329 --> 01:08:46.373
My baking paradise.

971
01:08:47.415 --> 01:08:49.334
Everything is ruined.

972
01:08:51.294 --> 01:08:52.420
Admit it: you're happy.

973
01:08:52.587 --> 01:08:55.382
Remind me...
who wanted to destroy something?


974
01:08:55.548 --> 01:08:57.300
It was you.

975
01:08:57.467 --> 01:08:59.344
That's the way it's always been.

976
01:08:59.511 --> 01:09:01.429
No, that's not true.

977
01:09:02.347 --> 01:09:03.431
Don't you remember?

978
01:09:20.323 --> 01:09:22.534
It's time for you to finally get along.

979
01:09:24.327 --> 01:09:25.453
Elfie is right.

980
01:09:28.331 --> 01:09:29.374
It's not that hard.

981
01:09:29.541 --> 01:09:31.459
We Elfkins always used to think:

982
01:09:31.626 --> 01:09:34.421
"Humans? Who needs them?

983
01:09:34.587 --> 01:09:38.383
Humans? We Elfkins don't need them.

984
01:09:38.550 --> 01:09:40.343
Humans..."

985
01:09:40.510 --> 01:09:43.555
"...eat Elfkins for breakfast.
Hats and all."


986
01:09:47.475 --> 01:09:50.437
The truth is,
we've been missing you all this time.


987
01:09:50.603 --> 01:09:52.564
That's right, we just forgot.

988
01:09:53.356 --> 01:09:56.317
So if we can
get on with you humans...

989
01:09:56.484 --> 01:09:59.487
...you two ridiculous humans can do it too.

990
01:10:13.585 --> 01:10:15.503
You dumb donkey.

991
01:10:15.670 --> 01:10:17.422
You idiotic...

992
01:10:17.589 --> 01:10:19.466
Sourpuss!

993
01:10:38.443 --> 01:10:39.569
Those cream spires!

994
01:10:42.447 --> 01:10:43.615
The pineapple tarts are ready.

995
01:10:44.491 --> 01:10:45.617
Hurry up, sleepyhead.

996
01:10:46.409 --> 01:10:48.369
Where are the chocolate Elfkins?

997
01:10:48.536 --> 01:10:50.580
Don't dilly-dally, you lazybones!

998
01:11:02.634 --> 01:11:04.594
Stop pushing, boy.

999
01:11:05.512 --> 01:11:06.513
Come back here!

1000
01:11:06.679 --> 01:11:08.556
There's enough to go around.

1001
01:11:10.475 --> 01:11:11.518
Will you be okay on your own?

1002
01:11:11.684 --> 01:11:13.478
Of course.

1003
01:11:14.437 --> 01:11:15.438
Have fun!

1004
01:11:20.527 --> 01:11:21.611
Showtime!

1005
01:11:33.623 --> 01:11:35.667
Time to start!

1006
01:11:36.501 --> 01:11:37.585
Let the Elfkin Festival...

1007
01:11:37.752 --> 01:11:39.504
"begin!

1008
01:11:44.509 --> 01:11:47.470
And now for my masterpiece:

1009
01:11:47.637 --> 01:11:48.680
a turnip cake!

1010
01:11:49.472 --> 01:11:51.516
Not again.
- Gross.


1011
01:11:52.517 --> 01:11:53.518
Just kidding.

1012
01:11:55.603 --> 01:11:57.647
It really is a masterpiece.

1013
01:12:02.694 --> 01:12:05.697
Look! It's me!
- I want the biggest piece...


1014
01:12:14.706 --> 01:12:17.542
If any of you ever need help,

1015
01:12:17.709 --> 01:12:20.670
now you know:
We're swift, smart and swoosh!
