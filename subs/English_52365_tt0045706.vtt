2
00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.180
The Khan of Bukistan is pleased that you have taken
a fancy to his daughter Tarji.


3
00:02:27.181 --> 00:02:28.581
So am I.

4
00:02:32.082 --> 00:02:33.882
She is only a girl.

5
00:02:33.883 --> 00:02:35.583
Yes, isn't she?

6
00:02:42.684 --> 00:02:44.484
My, she's a wonderful girl.

7
00:02:44.485 --> 00:02:46.485
I didn't know they
still made them like this.

8
00:02:46.486 --> 00:02:48.386
In Bukistan we are old fashioned.

9
00:02:48.387 --> 00:02:51.687
Women are wives and mothers,
as Allah intended them to be.


10
00:02:51.688 --> 00:02:54.588
They are not taxi cab drivers and wrestlers.

11
00:02:55.389 --> 00:02:57.289
Yes, I see what you mean.

12
00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.190
I do not understand your country.

13
00:02:59.191 --> 00:03:01.791
In America machines do everything.

14
00:03:01.792 --> 00:03:03.892
Hm, not quite.

15
00:03:03.893 --> 00:03:06.293
American ingenuity will find a way.

16
00:03:06.294 --> 00:03:08.494
And when it does do not
try and sell it to us.

17
00:03:12.195 --> 00:03:15.395
It is the custom for the princess to dance
for an honored guest.


18
00:03:15.396 --> 00:03:17.696
That's a delightful custom, by all means.

19
00:03:53.097 --> 00:03:56.197
The princess would be sensational in America.

20
00:03:57.598 --> 00:04:00.598
There are many suitors
for the princess Tarji's hand.

21
00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:03.199
But the Khan has
found them unworthy of her.

22
00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.600
I don't wonder.
It's a pity.


23
00:04:06.201 --> 00:04:09.301
Our women have been taught from birth
the perfect art.


24
00:04:09.302 --> 00:04:11.302
How to make a man happy.

25
00:04:12.103 --> 00:04:14.603
The princess Tarji would be the ideal wife.

26
00:04:15.804 --> 00:04:18.304
Every secret and every
skill of five thousand years

27
00:04:18.305 --> 00:04:21.205
have been imparted to her
every day and night of her life.


28
00:04:23.206 --> 00:04:27.606
You see before you a woman who's entire being
is dedicated to but one desire.


29
00:04:28.507 --> 00:04:32.279
The desire to bring to her husband the gift
of complete happiness.


30
00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.480
A pity you cannot stay.

31
00:04:34.481 --> 00:04:36.481
Yes, isn't it?

32
00:04:36.482 --> 00:04:38.982
But I'm getting married next week.

33
00:04:38.983 --> 00:04:41.083
Well, then, of course you cannot stay.

34
00:04:41.084 --> 00:04:42.484
No, sir, I...

35
00:04:42.485 --> 00:04:44.785
Oh, you speak English!

36
00:04:44.786 --> 00:04:48.786
Well, I'm glad, because there's something
I'd like to add to that deal we made...


37
00:04:52.787 --> 00:04:54.187
Now I see.

38
00:06:02.988 --> 00:06:04.588
Thank you very much.

39
00:06:04.589 --> 00:06:06.289
Please thank the princess for me.

40
00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:11.790
And tell the Khan how grateful I am
for his hospitality.


41
00:06:11.791 --> 00:06:13.691
Shall we have the
pleasure of seeing you again?

42
00:06:13.692 --> 00:06:16.092
No, I'm afraid not.
My plane leaves first thing in the morning.


43
00:06:16.093 --> 00:06:19.993
But do tell Tarji that I shall think of her often
and remember the time we spent together.


44
00:06:19.994 --> 00:06:21.694
If I were free, I...

45
00:06:25.695 --> 00:06:29.595
His excellency is pleased to present you
with this remembrance of your visit here.


46
00:06:29.596 --> 00:06:33.196
Oh, thank you. 
That's very thoughtful of you, sir.

47
00:06:33.197 --> 00:06:35.697
Uh... that's very thoughtful of him.

48
00:06:35.698 --> 00:06:38.988
And please accept this from the princess
as a token of her friendship.


49
00:06:38.989 --> 00:06:42.439
Oh, Tarji... thank you, dear.

50
00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:43.740
Katan!

51
00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:46.440
I won't forget you.

52
00:06:51.241 --> 00:06:54.541
She's asking you for a remembrance.
She admires your tie.


53
00:06:54.972 --> 00:06:56.842
Oh, well, of course.

54
00:07:00.243 --> 00:07:01.543
Darling.

55
00:07:02.143 --> 00:07:04.243
She speaks English like a native, doesn't she?

56
00:07:05.344 --> 00:07:07.544
Well, goodbye.

57
00:07:46.945 --> 00:07:49.245
Your name, please.
Clemson Reade.


58
00:07:49.246 --> 00:07:51.146
Under the "R"s.
Thank you.


59
00:08:46.447 --> 00:08:48.637
Hello, it's nice to
see you again, Mr. Reade.

60
00:08:48.638 --> 00:08:50.838
Thank you, Evelyn.
May I park this stuff here?


61
00:08:50.839 --> 00:08:54.839
Certainly. I'll tell Miss Effington you're here.
Don't do that. I want to surprise her.


62
00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:00.240
Effie!

63
00:09:00.741 --> 00:09:01.741
Clem!

64
00:09:01.982 --> 00:09:03.242
Effie!

65
00:09:14.643 --> 00:09:18.943
Oh, Clem, this is Mr. Portman, Mr. Whitley,
Mr. Bexton...


66
00:09:18.944 --> 00:09:20.884
Mr. Reade, my fiancé.

67
00:09:20.885 --> 00:09:24.285
Mr. Reade.
I must say I'm delighted to meet you.


68
00:09:24.286 --> 00:09:26.186
Mustn't I?

69
00:09:26.187 --> 00:09:28.687
I think that about covers everything.

70
00:09:29.488 --> 00:09:31.580
You'll each get a copy of the report

71
00:09:31.581 --> 00:09:34.180
and the Secretary of State will take action
on it next week.


72
00:09:34.181 --> 00:09:36.181
Thank you.
Thank you, Miss Effington.


73
00:09:36.182 --> 00:09:37.582
Good day, gentlemen.

74
00:09:40.283 --> 00:09:41.483
Darling!
Dearest!


75
00:09:43.284 --> 00:09:46.084
Welcome home, darling.
You can say that again.


76
00:09:50.885 --> 00:09:52.785
Now then, tell me all about your trip.

77
00:09:52.786 --> 00:09:54.486
Everything?
Everything.


78
00:09:54.487 --> 00:09:56.887
Oh, well, Effie, it was the most amazing...

79
00:09:58.088 --> 00:09:59.788
Sorry, dear.

80
00:10:00.889 --> 00:10:03.589
Yes, Mac.
When is the revised report going out?


81
00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:06.190
It's ready now, but I think it would be better
to condense it first.


82
00:10:06.191 --> 00:10:10.091
All right. But don't let them lose any time on it.
Is Kramer going to take it himself?


83
00:10:10.092 --> 00:10:11.692
Yes, he's leaving on the 15th.

84
00:10:11.693 --> 00:10:14.893
Be sure he doesn't go in cold.
Give him the background on the situation.


85
00:10:14.894 --> 00:10:18.194
Right, he's being briefed on it.
What about Camfrid?


86
00:10:18.195 --> 00:10:21.195
I'm keeping after him,
but I'll check on it again this afternoon.


87
00:10:21.196 --> 00:10:22.496
Thank you.

88
00:10:25.197 --> 00:10:27.997
Well, that sounds just wonderful, darling.
What else did you do?


89
00:10:27.998 --> 00:10:30.098
What else did I...

90
00:10:31.499 --> 00:10:32.699
Oh, I'm sorry.

91
00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:37.100
Effington... Yes, I'm ready.

92
00:10:38.201 --> 00:10:39.801
It's Aberdan.
Oh!


93
00:10:40.402 --> 00:10:43.402
Hello!
Hello, Givney.


94
00:10:43.403 --> 00:10:46.103
Yes, we received it. 
It's an interesting idea,

95
00:10:46.104 --> 00:10:49.104
but we don't think it's practical.
It might cause a great deal of trouble.


96
00:10:49.505 --> 00:10:54.105
Hm... well you can trust Mr. You-know-who
but you've got to be careful of the other one.


97
00:10:54.506 --> 00:10:55.606
Hmm...

98
00:10:55.607 --> 00:10:57.107
Exactly.

99
00:10:57.108 --> 00:10:59.808
Well, my suggestion is that you let them
make the first proposal


100
00:10:59.809 --> 00:11:01.609
and tell them you're awaiting instructions on it.

101
00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:06.010
What? Oh, nonsense.
Don't let them rush you.


102
00:11:07.011 --> 00:11:09.711
Right. You'll get an answer on it
within 48 hours.


103
00:11:09.712 --> 00:11:11.112
Goodbye.

104
00:11:12.813 --> 00:11:16.313
I'm sorry, darling. The oil situation
is a little tense right now


105
00:11:16.314 --> 00:11:18.979
but I am glad you
had such a successful trip.

106
00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:21.880
I hope I haven't bored
you with any of it.

107
00:11:21.881 --> 00:11:24.881
Oh, no. You know I'm
interested in everything you do.

108
00:11:26.782 --> 00:11:28.082
I'll bet that's for you.

109
00:11:28.983 --> 00:11:30.183
You win.

110
00:11:30.184 --> 00:11:31.884
Effington.

111
00:11:42.685 --> 00:11:44.085
Your mother?

112
00:11:44.686 --> 00:11:48.180
Effie, why don't we
go somewhere and be alone?

113
00:11:48.181 --> 00:11:50.131
Oh, I'd love to, darling,
but there isn't a chance.

114
00:11:50.132 --> 00:11:54.332
I'm scheduled for a meeting at the Consulate in 15 minutes...
Things haven't changed much, have they?


115
00:11:54.333 --> 00:11:57.333
It's just the oil crisis, dear.
There are so many plans to discuss.


116
00:11:57.334 --> 00:11:59.734
We had some plans of our own, remember?

117
00:11:59.735 --> 00:12:01.235
Oh, I certainly do.

118
00:12:01.236 --> 00:12:04.136
All right. We'll discuss them at dinner tonight.

119
00:12:04.137 --> 00:12:06.937
We are having dinner together.
Of course!


120
00:12:06.938 --> 00:12:10.738
I've just talked to Givney again.
Here, take a look at Kaempfert's report.


121
00:12:10.739 --> 00:12:12.639
This thing is really snowballing.

122
00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:14.440
Now, what I think we should...

123
00:12:16.241 --> 00:12:17.941
How are you, Reade?
Fine.


124
00:12:17.942 --> 00:12:20.542
Have a nice trip?
Effie will tell you all about it.


125
00:12:21.443 --> 00:12:22.843
Tonight.

126
00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:18.444
This just arrived.
Oh, thank goodness, Annie.


127
00:13:21.045 --> 00:13:22.545
How's everything in the kitchen?
Oh, everything's fine.


128
00:13:22.546 --> 00:13:26.046
Fine, stop worrying, sir.
I'll give you plenty of time between courses.


129
00:13:26.047 --> 00:13:27.047
Thank you.

130
00:13:27.448 --> 00:13:29.048
Well, Brutus, how do you like it, huh?

131
00:13:29.049 --> 00:13:31.249
Soft music, flowers, candlelight, huh?

132
00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:33.250
Wait till you see this.

133
00:13:34.051 --> 00:13:36.251
We,, do you approve?

134
00:13:36.652 --> 00:13:37.552
Good.

135
00:13:48.253 --> 00:13:49.453
Well, here we go.

136
00:13:52.154 --> 00:13:53.754
Sorry I'm late, darling.

137
00:13:53.755 --> 00:13:55.155
Darling.

138
00:13:55.156 --> 00:13:58.156
What a day I've had.
You could have fooled me.


139
00:13:58.757 --> 00:14:00.257
Oh, hello, Brutus.

140
00:14:00.258 --> 00:14:03.258
Oh, isn't that a new hat?

141
00:14:03.259 --> 00:14:05.659
Yes, do you like it?
Oh, it's very pretty.


142
00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:11.860
It's awfully dark in here, dear.

143
00:14:13.661 --> 00:14:15.161
There, that's better.

144
00:14:23.662 --> 00:14:26.862
Fix me a drink, will you, darling?
Champagne coming up.


145
00:14:26.863 --> 00:14:29.163
Make it a Scotch
and water, would you, Clem?

146
00:14:31.064 --> 00:14:32.264
Yes, dear, yes.

147
00:14:32.765 --> 00:14:36.465
No ice, just a lemon
and easy on the water.

148
00:14:48.066 --> 00:14:49.866
Well, here we are, dear.

149
00:14:54.467 --> 00:14:56.067
Well, darling, here's to...

150
00:14:56.368 --> 00:14:57.868
...us.

151
00:15:02.569 --> 00:15:05.969
I'm so glad you're back.
Oh, darling, I'm glad to be back.


152
00:15:05.970 --> 00:15:07.470
I can assure you.

153
00:15:16.371 --> 00:15:18.571
Hello, Annie.
Good evening, Miss Effington.


154
00:15:18.572 --> 00:15:20.472
Dinner in ten minutes.
What...


155
00:15:20.473 --> 00:15:22.583
Ten minutes?
What's the matter?


156
00:15:22.584 --> 00:15:24.584
I have to go
and make the salad dressing.

157
00:15:24.585 --> 00:15:26.085
O know how you love it.

158
00:15:26.086 --> 00:15:27.686
Excuse me, dear, 
I'll only be a minute.

159
00:15:57.487 --> 00:16:01.987
Everything under control in the kitchen?
Oh, yes, wait until you taste it.


160
00:16:04.288 --> 00:16:05.988
Is that a new bow tie?

161
00:16:05.989 --> 00:16:08.589
Yes, do you like it?
Hmm, I do.


162
00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:10.590
I always like your bow ties.

163
00:16:13.991 --> 00:16:15.591
Now, that's better.

164
00:16:16.192 --> 00:16:20.192
This is the first time I've relaxed in three weeks.
Good.


165
00:16:20.693 --> 00:16:23.973
Honestly we never dreamed there'd be
this much fuss about the oil leases.


166
00:16:23.974 --> 00:16:28.074
First Iraq, then Iran, and
now Bukistan is in the act.

167
00:16:28.075 --> 00:16:30.775
Thank heavens I'm a woman. 
A man couldn't take it.

168
00:16:31.776 --> 00:16:33.276
Never, my darling.

169
00:16:33.277 --> 00:16:36.577
A week from tomorrow
you can forget about everything except us.


170
00:16:37.578 --> 00:16:40.978
I've been thinking about that, Clem.
Oh, so have I.


171
00:16:42.279 --> 00:16:45.779
Now, I can't make up my mind
where we ought to spend our honeymoon.


172
00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:51.480
Bermuda, Honolulu, the farm in Vermont,
or shall we just throw the key away?


173
00:16:52.081 --> 00:16:53.681
Clem...
What?


174
00:16:53.682 --> 00:16:57.582
I'm afraid we'll have to postpone the wedding
till after the oil deal is signed.


175
00:16:57.979 --> 00:17:01.083
What?
I don't see any other way, truly I don't.


176
00:17:01.084 --> 00:17:02.864
There are so many things to get done.

177
00:17:02.865 --> 00:17:05.865
Meetings, conferences, reports,
and all of them so urgent.


178
00:17:05.866 --> 00:17:08.666
So is our wedding.
But I mean really urgent.


179
00:17:08.667 --> 00:17:11.937
Oh, for God's...
I mean, we can wait. The Middle East can't.


180
00:17:11.938 --> 00:17:14.038
We can get married any time.
Can we?


181
00:17:14.039 --> 00:17:16.739
Look, darling, I want us to be together
just as much as you do.


182
00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:19.340
But I can't let MacBride down.
He's counting on me.


183
00:17:19.341 --> 00:17:22.841
Of course not.
Perhaps we could work in the wedding somehow.


184
00:17:22.842 --> 00:17:24.932
You know, between phone calls.

185
00:17:24.933 --> 00:17:28.033
Now just a minute. Don't you think you're being
a little selfish?


186
00:17:28.034 --> 00:17:29.634
You mean for wanting to get married?

187
00:17:29.635 --> 00:17:32.980
No, for putting your own happiness
before the welfare of the United States.


188
00:17:32.981 --> 00:17:37.681
Oh, Effie, if I thought the welfare of the United States
depended upon your answering a telephone...


189
00:17:37.682 --> 00:17:39.082
Oh, so that's it.

190
00:17:39.083 --> 00:17:44.183
You think what I'm doing is like belonging to a garden club
or having a hot game of Mahjong with the girls.


191
00:17:44.184 --> 00:17:46.434
No, no, I didn't say that.
You didn't have to.


192
00:17:46.435 --> 00:17:50.035
You just can't believe that anything I'm doing
can be important enough to really matter.


193
00:17:50.036 --> 00:17:54.136
Oh, please, let's not get into that again.
We are in it, and we might as well have it out.


194
00:17:54.137 --> 00:17:55.979
Come over here.

195
00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:58.280
Here's Bukistan.
I know, I've been there.


196
00:17:58.281 --> 00:18:00.080
Here's the United States.
I've been there too.


197
00:18:00.081 --> 00:18:02.581
We have just one thing in common. Oil.

198
00:18:02.582 --> 00:18:05.582
Every plan we've make for peace or war
depends on that oil.


199
00:18:05.583 --> 00:18:07.683
Is that so?
I don't have to tell you what happened in Iran.


200
00:18:07.684 --> 00:18:10.584
Half the free world had to learn to pronounce
the name Mosaddegh.


201
00:18:10.585 --> 00:18:12.385
I still can't pronounce it.
The same thing is happening again...


202
00:18:12.386 --> 00:18:14.786
only this time there'll be a
lot of new names to learn.

203
00:18:14.787 --> 00:18:18.387
And the only way we can get that oil
is to get those names on the dotted line.


204
00:18:18.388 --> 00:18:20.688
Really?
And that's why this deal is so important.


205
00:18:20.689 --> 00:18:24.089
And I'm in charge, Clem,
whether you like it or not, I am in charge.


206
00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:27.690
Yes, yes...
And if that's the Julliard Matron's Needlepoint Society,
I'll leave my hat.


207
00:18:28.291 --> 00:18:31.491
Don't remember what you were going to say
until I get back. Be a good girl.


208
00:18:36.192 --> 00:18:38.692
Sorry to break in on you, Reade,
but your phone's out of order.


209
00:18:38.693 --> 00:18:40.193
I've been calling all evening.

210
00:18:40.194 --> 00:18:42.294
We had a cable from Marley.

211
00:18:42.295 --> 00:18:44.395
Givney's walked out. 
The pot's really boiling.

212
00:18:44.396 --> 00:18:45.796
Givney's walked out?
Givney walked.


213
00:18:45.797 --> 00:18:47.977
It must have been over his ears.
He can outweigh a pyramid.


214
00:18:47.978 --> 00:18:49.878
I hate to be upsetting your evening,

215
00:18:49.879 --> 00:18:52.679
but this is so hot the words
are just jumping off the papers.


216
00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:53.980
Here, let me see it.

217
00:18:55.581 --> 00:18:57.481
I'm afraid this is
going to postpone your honeymoon.

218
00:18:57.482 --> 00:19:00.882
Don't worry about it.
You see, we were right about this cookie.


219
00:19:00.883 --> 00:19:02.483
Yes, but Glenson's weaker than we thought.

220
00:19:02.484 --> 00:19:05.484
Dinner is ready.
Oh, start without me, Clem, I'll be right there.


221
00:19:05.485 --> 00:19:07.785
No, no, no...

222
00:19:07.979 --> 00:19:11.586
I don't believe you heard Annie.
Dinner is ready.


223
00:19:14.987 --> 00:19:17.387
Pull up a chair, Mac.
I've eaten already.


224
00:19:17.388 --> 00:19:20.688
I will have a little coffee, though.

225
00:19:20.689 --> 00:19:24.689
I wish you'd go over that fourth paragraph.
Hm-hmm.


226
00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:26.190
Right in here, now.

227
00:19:27.791 --> 00:19:31.491
You see...
We'll have to change our tactics, I can see that.


228
00:19:31.492 --> 00:19:36.492
We'll have to take part IV and put it
under the heading of Administration and Supply.


229
00:19:36.493 --> 00:19:38.093
Pass the salt, please.

230
00:19:38.094 --> 00:19:41.894
There are still a few things to be worked out,
but I'm sure you can handle them.


231
00:19:41.895 --> 00:19:43.495
Pass the pepper, please.

232
00:19:43.496 --> 00:19:46.896
Now, under this heading here, uh...

233
00:19:46.897 --> 00:19:49.597
Contract Negotiations, part III

234
00:19:49.598 --> 00:19:51.498
Bread.

235
00:19:53.599 --> 00:19:55.399
I don't use butter.

236
00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:05.400
You know, Bukistan may turn out to be
the key to this whole thing.


237
00:20:05.401 --> 00:20:09.301
If they fall in line, the rest will follow.
Right now we have to get to Haroun.


238
00:20:09.302 --> 00:20:11.602
First things first.
Right.


239
00:20:11.603 --> 00:20:14.503
Right... right!

240
00:20:15.204 --> 00:20:17.504
Now hear this and hear it good.

241
00:20:17.505 --> 00:20:21.505
This is only going to take a minute but it may be
the most important minute in our lives.


242
00:20:21.506 --> 00:20:25.506
You can put it under the heading of Clem and Effie,
Basic Principles, Part I.


243
00:20:25.507 --> 00:20:28.307
Perhaps I'd better...
No, I want you to hear it, too.


244
00:20:29.308 --> 00:20:32.288
I'm in love with
you, not the State Department.

245
00:20:32.289 --> 00:20:34.789
I didn't...
I'm not through.


246
00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:39.690
Now, if a woman can run a home and still find time
to have a career, that's fine.


247
00:20:39.691 --> 00:20:41.891
But first things first.

248
00:20:41.892 --> 00:20:43.692
Clem...
No, just a minute.


249
00:20:43.693 --> 00:20:47.093
We haven't been able to make a definite plan
since we met.


250
00:20:47.094 --> 00:20:49.294
We went to Vermont for two weeks.

251
00:20:49.295 --> 00:20:51.195
Yes, yes, that's right.

252
00:20:51.196 --> 00:20:52.896
To her grandfather's farm.

253
00:20:52.897 --> 00:20:56.597
For two wonderful relaxing weeks in glorious Vermont.

254
00:20:56.598 --> 00:20:59.398
It's heavenly there in September.
We spent one day there.


255
00:20:59.399 --> 00:21:02.399
She had to leave to take care
of a crisis in the Sahara.


256
00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:04.400
Some of the sand was missing.

257
00:21:04.401 --> 00:21:07.201
Well, you stayed on.
Yes, with grandfather.


258
00:21:07.202 --> 00:21:09.602
It wasn't the same thing.
No, no...


259
00:21:09.603 --> 00:21:13.103
No, no, I don't like this idea,
we can work in the wedding somehow...


260
00:21:13.104 --> 00:21:16.204
Or if we can't leave on our honeymoon together
I can start without you...


261
00:21:16.205 --> 00:21:17.705
I don't like that.

262
00:21:18.706 --> 00:21:21.006
Perhaps we're both looking for different things.

263
00:21:21.007 --> 00:21:23.807
And if we are, it's best to find it out now
and call it quits.


264
00:21:23.808 --> 00:21:27.408
Clem, I can't just toss this all over,
it's too important.


265
00:21:27.409 --> 00:21:29.309
Well, now we know what's important, don't we?

266
00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:31.110
Oh, I wish you'd understand.

267
00:21:31.111 --> 00:21:33.511
I think I've understood all along.
I've just been kidding myself.


268
00:21:33.512 --> 00:21:37.512
I want a full-time wife and you want
a part-time husband, it's as simple as that.


269
00:21:37.513 --> 00:21:40.913
Look, you two. You'll both think differently
about this in the morning.


270
00:21:40.914 --> 00:21:45.514
No, Mac, I'm afraid this is morning.
It's time to go back counting sand.


271
00:21:45.515 --> 00:21:48.515
Oh, I didn't mean that. 
What you're doing is important.

272
00:21:48.516 --> 00:21:50.786
But not as important as cooking your breakfast.
Right.


273
00:21:50.787 --> 00:21:53.816
Well you don't need me for that.
You can buy it for a dollar an hour.


274
00:21:53.817 --> 00:21:58.017
We've been emancipated, Mr. Reade.
Have you ever heard of Susan B. Anthony?


275
00:21:58.818 --> 00:22:02.478
Can she cook?
It just so happens she got women the right to vote.


276
00:22:02.479 --> 00:22:06.959
Oh, now, really. You're not going to give me that
Amelia Bloom and Harriet Beecher Stowe routine.


277
00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:10.460
What's wrong with them?
They were probably lousy housekeepers.


278
00:22:15.361 --> 00:22:16.461
Come on, Mac.

279
00:22:22.262 --> 00:22:23.462
Thanks for the coffee.

280
00:22:30.163 --> 00:22:31.763
Hello, gentlemen.
Hello, again.


281
00:22:31.764 --> 00:22:33.364
Sorry I'm late.
Ken, you're just in time.


282
00:22:33.365 --> 00:22:35.265
We were just discussing
Rogers and the Fuller account.

283
00:22:35.266 --> 00:22:37.766
That was a beautiful job.
Nothing to it.


284
00:22:37.767 --> 00:22:39.867
Rogers got unlucky, I got lucky.
Yeah, I'll say.


285
00:22:39.868 --> 00:22:41.668
He did that account for over 15 years.

286
00:22:41.669 --> 00:22:43.979
I'd like to see the look on his face
when he found out he'd lost it.


287
00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:46.780
Ten days ago on that Russell account we...

288
00:22:48.581 --> 00:22:52.681
we put the canteloupes in the oven because
the ice cubes fell off the little boy's scooter.


289
00:22:53.482 --> 00:22:57.082
Hm? Oh, that's fine, Charlie, just fine.
What's fine?


290
00:22:58.183 --> 00:23:01.283
Charlie, tell me something.
How long have you been married?


291
00:23:02.284 --> 00:23:05.084
Seventeen years, why?
What's your wife like?


292
00:23:05.085 --> 00:23:06.485
Well, May's like...

293
00:23:08.186 --> 00:23:09.786
You fellows know May. 
What's she like?

294
00:23:09.787 --> 00:23:12.987
Well, she's nice, a little bossy.

295
00:23:12.988 --> 00:23:15.888
Yeah... plays lousy bridge.

296
00:23:15.889 --> 00:23:17.889
Yeah, that's what she's like.

297
00:23:17.890 --> 00:23:20.990
Jean and I haven't had
a quarrel in 10 years.

298
00:23:20.991 --> 00:23:23.291
Whenever we're in the same room long enough.

299
00:23:23.792 --> 00:23:26.792
I make it a practice to take May little presents
every now and then.


300
00:23:26.793 --> 00:23:29.979
It's something I picked up from her first husband.
He told me about it in court.


301
00:23:30.094 --> 00:23:32.194
It does help keep her quiet.

302
00:23:32.195 --> 00:23:34.395
Of course I think
you fellows are all wrong.

303
00:23:34.396 --> 00:23:36.596
Take it from the
veteran with the service stripes.

304
00:23:36.597 --> 00:23:39.197
No, no, let's hear what the newlywed has to say.
Go ahead, shoot.


305
00:23:39.698 --> 00:23:44.398
Well, I've only been married a year, but
I think you can make a marriage anything you want it to be.


306
00:23:44.399 --> 00:23:47.299
Of course the trick is
to find a girl like Louise.

307
00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:50.600
When I go home at night
I know she's there waiting for me.


308
00:23:51.901 --> 00:23:53.501
It's got feeling.

309
00:23:53.702 --> 00:23:56.202
It doesn't matter what we
do, we always have fun.

310
00:23:56.703 --> 00:23:59.903
Sometimes we'll take a walk somewhere,
or maybe go to a movie.


311
00:23:59.904 --> 00:24:03.504
Maybe we'll just stay home
in front of the fire and read.


312
00:24:04.005 --> 00:24:05.605
It's great.

313
00:24:05.606 --> 00:24:09.906
And then sometimes, when we're in the mood,
we three of us go to a nightclub.


314
00:24:10.707 --> 00:24:12.007
The three of you?

315
00:24:13.008 --> 00:24:16.208
Why, yes.
My mother-in-law lives with us.


316
00:24:16.909 --> 00:24:19.769
Now wait a minute, fellows.
We shouldn't talk like this in front of Clem.


317
00:24:19.770 --> 00:24:22.770
He's gonna be a bridegroom next week.
No, I'm not.


318
00:24:22.771 --> 00:24:25.171
Effie and I called the
whole thing off last night.

319
00:24:25.172 --> 00:24:27.472
Oh, I'm sorry, Clem. 
I'm really sorry.

320
00:24:27.473 --> 00:24:31.173
Why are you sorry?
You just got finished showing me how lucky I am.


321
00:24:31.674 --> 00:24:34.374
There isn't one of you can look me straight in the eye
and tell me you're happily married.


322
00:24:34.375 --> 00:24:36.475
You've had to make a million compromises.

323
00:24:36.476 --> 00:24:38.476
Why do we always
have to cater to women?

324
00:24:38.477 --> 00:24:42.677
We put them on pedestals,
we make up cockeyed rules about the weaker sex.


325
00:24:42.978 --> 00:24:47.178
You get into an elevator with one of the weaker sex
and you take off our hat in some kind of pagan tribute.


326
00:24:47.179 --> 00:24:52.079
Twenty minutes later the same delicate female is driving
a taxicab through traffic and cursing like a muleskinner.


327
00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:55.280
We keep treating them like flowers
and they keep outliving us.


328
00:24:55.281 --> 00:24:58.980
Right now they control 70% of the wealth
of this country and are they satisfied?


329
00:24:58.981 --> 00:25:00.881
No, they want to control the country.

330
00:25:00.882 --> 00:25:04.282
They're Ambassadors, they're in the senate,
they're even in the State Department.


331
00:25:04.283 --> 00:25:06.383
That fight with Effie
must have been a lulu.

332
00:25:06.384 --> 00:25:08.184
No, I'm glad it happened.

333
00:25:08.185 --> 00:25:11.085
We were all wrong for each other.
We both saw that last night.


334
00:25:11.086 --> 00:25:14.086
Most people are afraid to face such problems.

335
00:25:14.087 --> 00:25:17.387
They get married, find out they don't belong together
then they have to get a divorce.


336
00:25:17.388 --> 00:25:18.979
You took a shortcut.

337
00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:23.380
There must be a girl somewhere who thinks
it's a wonderful career just to have a home and babies,


338
00:25:23.381 --> 00:25:25.981
whose only thought is
to make her husband happy.

339
00:25:25.982 --> 00:25:29.282
That kind of girl went out with the cavemen.
Only if they had money.


340
00:25:31.383 --> 00:25:32.483
Clem!

341
00:25:33.284 --> 00:25:34.384
Clem?

342
00:25:35.685 --> 00:25:37.085
What's the matter?

343
00:25:38.286 --> 00:25:40.286
Suppose there were a girl like that.

344
00:25:40.287 --> 00:25:43.887
Suppose I had found a girl who was trained
from the day she was born


345
00:25:43.888 --> 00:25:46.088
to be a dream wife. 
What would you say?

346
00:25:46.089 --> 00:25:47.389
I'd say she got a  friend.

347
00:25:47.890 --> 00:25:49.840
It was right under my
nose and I couldn't see it.

348
00:25:49.841 --> 00:25:52.741
I said no.
You sound like a schoolboy in love.


349
00:25:59.042 --> 00:26:01.142
Miss Temple. Take a cable.

350
00:26:02.043 --> 00:26:06.643
Princess Tarji Suleimani, Bukistan.

351
00:26:25.244 --> 00:26:27.844
Oh!
May I come in?


352
00:26:29.445 --> 00:26:31.245
Would it make any
difference if I said no?

353
00:26:31.246 --> 00:26:32.246
No.

354
00:26:32.547 --> 00:26:36.247
Before you get any ideas I think you should know
I'm here on official business.


355
00:26:36.248 --> 00:26:39.948
Did you send a cable this afternoon?
Yes, yes I did.


356
00:26:39.949 --> 00:26:43.749
But I hardly think that concerns the State Department.
I'm afraid it does.


357
00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:45.680
It was addressed to the Princess of Bukistan.

358
00:26:45.681 --> 00:26:49.381
Now look. Your beloved State Department
can butt into almost anything they like,


359
00:26:49.382 --> 00:26:54.382
but this time my love life does not concern them.
That cable is a personal matter.


360
00:26:54.383 --> 00:26:57.983
Every cable that goes out of here to Bukistan
has to clear through the State Department.


361
00:26:57.984 --> 00:27:00.864
And I don't think your idea of a joke
is very funny.


362
00:27:00.865 --> 00:27:02.565
What joke?
You know perfectly well.


363
00:27:02.566 --> 00:27:05.566
This cable reads like a proposal of marriage
to the princess.


364
00:27:05.567 --> 00:27:07.167
That's exactly what it is.

365
00:27:07.368 --> 00:27:08.668
Are you serious?

366
00:27:08.669 --> 00:27:12.069
Are you asking as a woman or a member
of the State Department?


367
00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:14.270
I thought you went over there to work.

368
00:27:14.271 --> 00:27:15.671
As a woman.

369
00:27:15.672 --> 00:27:18.172
My interest in this is purely political.

370
00:27:18.173 --> 00:27:21.103
We happen to have a very tense oil situation
over there at the moment


371
00:27:21.104 --> 00:27:23.204
and a joke like this may be misconstrued.

372
00:27:23.205 --> 00:27:26.205
I don't consider a
proposal of marriage a joke.

373
00:27:26.706 --> 00:27:29.306
You're really serious.
What's the matter with that?


374
00:27:30.007 --> 00:27:32.107
You hardly know the girl.

375
00:27:32.108 --> 00:27:34.468
I know her well enough to want to spend
the rest of my life with her.


376
00:27:34.469 --> 00:27:36.369
By that time I
should know her even better.

377
00:27:37.870 --> 00:27:40.970
Clem, if this is a rebound thing, I...
It isn't.


378
00:27:42.971 --> 00:27:45.271
Well, you don't know
what you'll be letting yourself in for.


379
00:27:45.272 --> 00:27:47.172
It's not like marrying an American girl.

380
00:27:47.173 --> 00:27:48.673
I hope not.

381
00:27:48.674 --> 00:27:52.374
Now tell me, is there any law against
my marrying Tarji?


382
00:27:52.375 --> 00:27:54.375
Of course not.
Good.


383
00:27:54.376 --> 00:27:57.176
Then I intend to.
You can tell that to your State Department.


384
00:27:57.177 --> 00:28:00.337
All right.
Would you like to give the cable to me?


385
00:28:00.338 --> 00:28:02.338
No, I would not.
Besides, I've already sent the cable.


386
00:28:02.339 --> 00:28:06.439
Why would I want to give it to you?
I have it here. They referred it back to our office.


387
00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:08.440
They did?

388
00:28:08.441 --> 00:28:11.161
If you would like to dictate another one,
I'll see that it's sent out.


389
00:28:11.162 --> 00:28:14.662
Oh, for heaven's...
Oh, well, all right, in that case, uh...


390
00:28:17.063 --> 00:28:19.763
Dear Miss... no.
Dear Princess


391
00:28:21.164 --> 00:28:23.264
Darling.

392
00:28:24.565 --> 00:28:29.365
Though I have known you but a few short weeks,
I find that I cannot forget you. Stop.


393
00:28:30.166 --> 00:28:33.166
I have never felt this
way about any girl before.

394
00:28:35.167 --> 00:28:38.867
I mean, I've never felt this way about any girl
from Bukistan before.


395
00:28:40.968 --> 00:28:42.868
Uh.... never mind. Start again.

396
00:28:44.669 --> 00:28:49.269
Darling, Though I have known you but a few short weeks,
I find that I cannot forget you.


397
00:28:49.270 --> 00:28:50.570
Yes, that's all right. Stop.

398
00:28:51.771 --> 00:28:55.171
Would appreciate your marrying me at once.
Please advise, yours truly, Clem Reade.


399
00:28:56.572 --> 00:28:57.872
Did you get that?

400
00:28:58.373 --> 00:29:00.573
No...
May I make a suggestion?


401
00:29:00.574 --> 00:29:02.674
What is it?

402
00:29:02.675 --> 00:29:05.675
Well, first of all, I wouldn't send it to her,
I'd send it to her father.


403
00:29:05.676 --> 00:29:07.976
I don't want to marry her father...
It's a custom.


404
00:29:07.977 --> 00:29:11.677
Secondly, there are certain lingual
and formal amenities to be observed.


405
00:29:11.678 --> 00:29:13.878
I'll see that it's properly reworded.

406
00:29:14.379 --> 00:29:15.679
Thanks.

407
00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:18.180
I know a little more about the East
than you do, Clem.


408
00:29:18.181 --> 00:29:21.681
She's an important princess.
Don't be surprised if you don't get an answer.


409
00:29:21.682 --> 00:29:23.582
Thanks, I won't.

410
00:29:23.583 --> 00:29:25.183
Good night, Clem.

411
00:29:25.184 --> 00:29:26.284
Good night.

412
00:29:31.485 --> 00:29:33.085
It's been three weeks!

413
00:29:33.086 --> 00:29:36.586
Oh, that's it.
I can't understand why I haven't heard.


414
00:29:36.587 --> 00:29:38.087
These things take time.

415
00:29:38.088 --> 00:29:41.588
Well, gentlemen, get this.
The entire order from Bukistan has been cancelled.


416
00:29:41.589 --> 00:29:43.789
They can't have cancelled it!
They've been offended.


417
00:29:43.790 --> 00:29:46.490
It's the cable you sent.
I didn't send it, Effie did.


418
00:29:47.591 --> 00:29:49.971
Effie! That double crosser!

419
00:29:49.972 --> 00:29:52.972
Miss Temple.
Get me Miss Effington at the State Department.


420
00:29:52.973 --> 00:29:54.673
Yes, sir.

421
00:29:55.774 --> 00:29:57.874
I got a delivery for Clemson Reade.
Where will I put it?


422
00:29:57.875 --> 00:29:59.675
This is his office. Bring it in.

423
00:29:59.676 --> 00:30:01.876
Here?
Yes.


424
00:30:01.877 --> 00:30:04.177
Okay, lady. Anything you say.

425
00:30:04.178 --> 00:30:07.278
Why, why... How do I know why?

426
00:30:07.279 --> 00:30:10.179
All I know is that 20
minutes ago we got this cable.

427
00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:12.680
Reade's proposal of marriage has been accepted.

428
00:30:12.681 --> 00:30:15.881
You confirmed it, didn't you?
Yes, yes.


429
00:30:15.882 --> 00:30:17.882
I still don't see
what's so terrible about it.

430
00:30:17.883 --> 00:30:19.683
Then I 'll tell you.

431
00:30:19.684 --> 00:30:23.284
All this deal needs is one little match
to blow it sky high.


432
00:30:23.285 --> 00:30:27.785
And this could be that match.
Oh, the khan seems friendly enough at present...


433
00:30:27.807 --> 00:30:31.807
but all his future son-in-law has to do is to whistle
to a pretty blonde and we're dead.


434
00:30:31.808 --> 00:30:33.708
Well, what can we do?

435
00:30:33.909 --> 00:30:36.109
There's only one thing we can do.

436
00:30:36.110 --> 00:30:40.310
We've got to see to it that this is
the happiest courtship since Romeo and Juliet.


437
00:30:40.311 --> 00:30:41.911
Nothing must go wrong.

438
00:30:41.912 --> 00:30:44.912
Because if they pfft!,
it'll be a pfft! all around the world.


439
00:30:45.613 --> 00:30:48.013
We need someone to make sure
that nothing does go wrong.


440
00:30:48.014 --> 00:30:53.314
Someone who knows the Bukistanian language,
Bukistanian customs and diplomatic protocol.


441
00:30:54.515 --> 00:30:57.615
And, if possible, Mr. 
Clemson Reade himself.

442
00:31:00.416 --> 00:31:02.216
Oh, no, wait a minute, Mac, I...

443
00:31:02.217 --> 00:31:04.217
Have you reached Miss Effington yet?

444
00:31:04.518 --> 00:31:05.518
She what?

445
00:31:05.719 --> 00:31:06.919
Well, keep try...

446
00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:17.720
What are these goats doing here?

447
00:31:17.721 --> 00:31:19.821
The lady said to bring them in.

448
00:31:19.822 --> 00:31:22.522
Oh, oh... I've been trying
to get a hold of you.

449
00:31:22.523 --> 00:31:24.723
What did you say
in that cable to Tarji?

450
00:31:24.724 --> 00:31:26.424
She's obviously turned me down.

451
00:31:26.425 --> 00:31:28.975
What do you think this is?
It's your dowry.


452
00:31:28.976 --> 00:31:30.676
My dowry?
Yes.


453
00:31:30.677 --> 00:31:32.477
Oh, that's wonderful.

454
00:31:36.678 --> 00:31:40.578
What are all these things?
It's a Bukistanian custom to give the bridegroom a dowry.


455
00:31:40.579 --> 00:31:43.079
It may be goats,
or sheep, or even camels.

456
00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:47.280
Well, then, why did they cancel the order?
They probably consider it "forpeit".


457
00:31:47.281 --> 00:31:51.481
For what?
Forpeit. Another custom.
Bad manners to deal in business till after the wedding.


458
00:31:51.482 --> 00:31:54.982
Well, I have a thousand and one problems.
I have to get plane reservations...


459
00:31:54.983 --> 00:31:57.583
hotel accommodations,
she'll probably be here in a month or two.


460
00:31:57.584 --> 00:32:00.484
What are you doing Saturday morning?
Nothing, why?


461
00:32:00.485 --> 00:32:04.185
Drop by at the airport. Your bride is arriving.
Uh... fine.


462
00:32:04.686 --> 00:32:07.486
I wonder how many people the princess
will bring in her party...


463
00:32:08.687 --> 00:32:09.887
Saturday?

464
00:32:10.688 --> 00:32:11.688
Effie!

465
00:32:13.189 --> 00:32:14.289
Effie!

466
00:32:39.490 --> 00:32:41.190
Look Mommy, look at the funny man.

467
00:32:41.191 --> 00:32:43.091
Don't point, darling. It's rude.

468
00:32:43.092 --> 00:32:45.392
What is it?
He's probably some kind of nut.


469
00:32:46.093 --> 00:32:47.893
Maybe he's making a movie.

470
00:32:47.894 --> 00:32:50.294
I bet he's advertising some kind of cigarette.

471
00:32:50.295 --> 00:32:53.395
No, that's an authentic costume.
I wonder how many wives he has.


472
00:32:53.396 --> 00:32:56.096
I'll bet he's from India.
Arabia.


473
00:32:56.097 --> 00:32:57.697
Huh-huh, Afghanistan.

474
00:32:57.698 --> 00:33:00.998
Schenectady!
Let go!


475
00:33:20.299 --> 00:33:22.399
What are you doing here?
I work here.


476
00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:24.200
We are the official reception committee.

477
00:33:24.201 --> 00:33:27.401
What are you made up for?
The student prince?


478
00:33:28.702 --> 00:33:33.202
I wouldn't expect you to understand.
I'm just showing a little consideration for my fiancée.


479
00:33:33.203 --> 00:33:34.803
I want her to feel at home.

480
00:33:47.104 --> 00:33:49.404
Why didn't you tell me?
You didn't ask me.


481
00:34:07.905 --> 00:34:09.505
Tarji!
Darling!


482
00:34:11.506 --> 00:34:14.206
Next time let's just shake hands.

483
00:34:15.007 --> 00:34:16.307
Katan, katan!

484
00:34:17.207 --> 00:34:19.307
Now, you've had your turn.
Now it's hers.


485
00:34:19.308 --> 00:34:21.608
I'm sorry, Reade, but we'd like
to get on with this. Go ahead.


486
00:34:21.809 --> 00:34:22.979
I'm sorry.

487
00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:39.980
That's very nice. I couldn't have said it
better myself.


488
00:34:39.981 --> 00:34:42.681
Now, if you'll all excuse me,
I'd like to be alone with my fiancée.


489
00:34:42.682 --> 00:34:45.082
Reade, there's a little matter of protocol
to be observed.


490
00:34:45.083 --> 00:34:48.183
We've made a few plans for the princess.

491
00:34:48.184 --> 00:34:50.284
Well, it happens I've made
some plans of my own.

492
00:34:50.285 --> 00:34:53.385
Now, Reade, don't give us any trouble.
This girl is a princess.


493
00:34:53.386 --> 00:34:56.686
The way she is treated happens to be very important
at this time.


494
00:34:56.687 --> 00:34:58.380
Is that clear?
No!


495
00:34:58.381 --> 00:35:00.981
Good. We'll escort her to the hotel.
But...


496
00:35:04.482 --> 00:35:05.682
Oh, wait!

497
00:35:17.483 --> 00:35:19.583
I thought we'd never be alone.

498
00:35:35.284 --> 00:35:36.684
May we quote you on that?

499
00:35:36.685 --> 00:35:39.285
Here he is! Mr. Reade,
when are you and the princess getting married?


500
00:35:39.286 --> 00:35:41.086
How does it feel to
be marrying to a rich princess?

501
00:35:41.087 --> 00:35:43.387
When you marry her, will you be a prince?
Where did you meet Tarji?


502
00:35:43.388 --> 00:35:44.979
If you don't mind,
this is a personal matter.

503
00:35:44.980 --> 00:35:47.350
Are you kidding? We got 10 million readers
who want to hear about this.


504
00:35:47.351 --> 00:35:49.451
Do you have any immediate plans?
Yes, I'm going up.


505
00:35:51.052 --> 00:35:54.352
I was afraid you were lost, Reade.
I want to give you our schedule.


506
00:35:54.353 --> 00:35:57.453
Tomorrow night is the official banquet.
Saturday we've arranged lunching...


507
00:35:57.454 --> 00:36:00.054
and Monday... I'll see that you get a list
of the other activities.


508
00:36:00.055 --> 00:36:04.555
Now look! If Washington thinks they're going to turn this
into a three-ring circus, they're crazy.


509
00:36:04.556 --> 00:36:07.256
I'll marry whomever I please
and I don't need any help from you.


510
00:36:07.257 --> 00:36:09.457
Now I'd appreciate it if you'd all get out
and leave us alone.


511
00:36:14.758 --> 00:36:17.758
What's she saying?
Well, she said something about a hot dog.


512
00:36:17.759 --> 00:36:19.159
Shall I have some sent up?

513
00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:21.360
Yes... no!

514
00:36:21.361 --> 00:36:23.961
Reade wants to handle everything.
Let him arrange it. Come on.


515
00:36:26.862 --> 00:36:29.362
Oh, yes, of course, your friends.
How do you do?


516
00:36:35.763 --> 00:36:38.363
Which one speaks English?

517
00:36:44.464 --> 00:36:46.764
You mean none of you speaks English?

518
00:36:51.365 --> 00:36:52.465
Darling?

519
00:36:52.466 --> 00:36:54.366
Oh, I have a feeling
I should have taught you more.

520
00:36:54.367 --> 00:36:57.767
Darling.
Oh, now that won't do at all.


521
00:36:57.768 --> 00:36:59.368
Just put the rest
of the luggage in there.

522
00:36:59.369 --> 00:37:01.369
I wonder if you could help me.

523
00:37:01.370 --> 00:37:04.470
I'm at your service, sir.
Do you happen to speak Bukistanian?


524
00:37:04.471 --> 00:37:07.271
I majored in French.
Spanish.


525
00:37:08.172 --> 00:37:11.572
You mean none of them speaks English?
No, unfortunately.


526
00:37:11.573 --> 00:37:16.273
It shouldn't be too difficult.
One can communicate without words.


527
00:37:17.774 --> 00:37:19.674
See, she's trying to tell me something.

528
00:37:20.475 --> 00:37:22.275
Yes, darling, you go ahead, 
I'm listening.

529
00:37:23.876 --> 00:37:25.576
It's too hot in here?

530
00:37:27.077 --> 00:37:29.577
Palm trees?
Goodbye, Arthur...


531
00:37:29.578 --> 00:37:32.878
No, it's something else.
Oh, I am an angel.


532
00:37:38.479 --> 00:37:39.979
Skyscraper?

533
00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:41.980
He hasn't done anything yet.

534
00:37:44.781 --> 00:37:46.681
There's something.
Oh, yes, this is good.


535
00:37:47.482 --> 00:37:49.582
A woman! Woman,

536
00:37:50.283 --> 00:37:52.283
No, smaller than that.
Girl?


537
00:37:52.284 --> 00:37:55.284
Pretty, pretty girl, eh?
A pretty girl is like a melody.


538
00:37:55.285 --> 00:37:56.785
Yes... a pretty girl...

539
00:37:56.786 --> 00:37:59.286
Does this fellow...
I think he's doing something new.


540
00:37:59.287 --> 00:38:01.587
He's eating. He's eating something.

541
00:38:01.588 --> 00:38:03.388
Chewing... food. Food?

542
00:38:03.389 --> 00:38:04.789
No, no. Meat!

543
00:38:06.690 --> 00:38:09.190
Sounds like... 
Sounds like meat.

544
00:38:09.191 --> 00:38:10.191
Mate.

545
00:38:10.192 --> 00:38:12.862
How can he do a word that sounds like another word
if he doesn't know the other word?


546
00:38:12.863 --> 00:38:14.963
I don't care. I think
I'm on the track of something.

547
00:38:14.964 --> 00:38:17.164
I something, something, mate.
Something, something, pretty girl.


548
00:38:18.465 --> 00:38:20.265
I've got it!
What?


549
00:38:20.266 --> 00:38:23.466
I brought you a mate,
now you find pretty girl for me.


550
00:38:24.867 --> 00:38:27.267
For him?
Sure, that's what he's been saying.


551
00:38:27.268 --> 00:38:29.868
Probably some kind of a custom.

552
00:38:31.069 --> 00:38:33.969
Naturally, it's absolutely against
the rules of the hotel.

553
00:38:33.970 --> 00:38:35.570
I know, I know...

554
00:38:35.571 --> 00:38:37.271
Who's winning?

555
00:38:37.272 --> 00:38:39.572
Oh, Effie. You're a lifesaver.

556
00:38:39.573 --> 00:38:41.279
Would you help me?

557
00:38:41.580 --> 00:38:44.280
Now, he wants me to provide a girl for him.
Would you explain that...


558
00:38:47.481 --> 00:38:49.181
What they're trying to tell you is

559
00:38:49.182 --> 00:38:54.082
The Princess Tarji has heard so much about them
she would very much like to have an American hot dog.


560
00:38:56.383 --> 00:38:59.383
Well, I guess you'll be running along.
Yes, yes.


561
00:38:59.384 --> 00:39:02.084
I'll see to it that
the princess gets a frankfurter.

562
00:39:04.385 --> 00:39:07.285
Why don't you run along
and give them a chance to get moved in?


563
00:39:07.286 --> 00:39:10.386
I haven't had a chance
to be with Tarji yet.

564
00:39:10.387 --> 00:39:11.887
You can be with her tonight.

565
00:39:16.388 --> 00:39:19.788
Yes, dear. We'll spend the evening alone,
just the two of us together.


566
00:39:19.789 --> 00:39:22.189
She won't have any trouble understanding me tonight.

567
00:39:23.890 --> 00:39:25.190
Ta-ta, dear.
Katan!


568
00:39:25.191 --> 00:39:26.891
There he goes katanning again.

569
00:39:26.892 --> 00:39:30.492
Goodbye, dear.
Oh, badibani.


570
00:39:35.993 --> 00:39:37.733
Good evening, Mr. Reade.
I just want you to know...


571
00:39:37.734 --> 00:39:40.834
that I have my entire staff alerted for anything,
anything at all.


572
00:39:40.835 --> 00:39:43.635
Any little special services
that the princess may require.

573
00:39:43.636 --> 00:39:45.936
After all, strangers in
a foreign land, you know.

574
00:39:45.937 --> 00:39:48.787
That's very kind of you,
but I don't think it will be necessary.


575
00:39:48.788 --> 00:39:52.088
They're no different from any of us.
They live just like you and me.


576
00:39:52.089 --> 00:39:53.089
Yes.

577
00:39:53.490 --> 00:39:54.690
Good night.

578
00:40:13.191 --> 00:40:16.191
Now, what are you doing here?
I think you'd better sit down.


579
00:40:16.192 --> 00:40:18.032
Why, has something happened to Tarji?

580
00:40:18.033 --> 00:40:20.933
No, and we don't want anything to happen to her.
That's why I'm here.


581
00:40:20.934 --> 00:40:22.580
And what does that mean?

582
00:40:22.581 --> 00:40:25.481
You're not going to like this any more than I do
but there's nothing we can do about it.


583
00:40:25.482 --> 00:40:29.782
About what?
I have been assigned to take care of you and Tarji.


584
00:40:30.583 --> 00:40:31.983
You've been what?

585
00:40:31.984 --> 00:40:36.084
That's ridiculous. That's utter nonsense.
If I need a nursemaid, I'll send for one.


586
00:40:36.085 --> 00:40:38.785
Now, why don't you just get your briefcase
and your horn book


587
00:40:38.786 --> 00:40:41.576
and run on down to the office and solve
all the little international problems


588
00:40:41.577 --> 00:40:43.867
This happens to be one
of the little international problems.

589
00:40:43.868 --> 00:40:46.568
At least it could, be and I'm here to see
that it isn't.


590
00:40:46.569 --> 00:40:50.269
Oh, no, you're not. And if you think
I'm going to let you interfere...


591
00:40:50.270 --> 00:40:52.270
I'm not going to interfere. 
I'm going to help you.

592
00:40:52.271 --> 00:40:54.571
This is just as important to
us as it is to you.

593
00:40:54.572 --> 00:40:56.872
You can look upon me
as a stick of furniture.

594
00:40:57.673 --> 00:41:00.273
No. Absolutely not. No, no...

595
00:41:00.274 --> 00:41:02.174
Oh, Tarji.

596
00:41:03.175 --> 00:41:06.075
Tarji, did you hear what she said?
She thinks that...


597
00:41:06.076 --> 00:41:08.576
That... uh...

598
00:41:10.277 --> 00:41:12.177
Can I tell her something for you?

599
00:41:13.078 --> 00:41:14.678
Yes, yes you can.

600
00:41:14.679 --> 00:41:18.179
Tell her that she
looks like a beautiful flower.

601
00:41:23.180 --> 00:41:24.480
Katan, katan!

602
00:41:24.481 --> 00:41:26.980
Stop that. It's all right now.
We're engaged.


603
00:41:27.781 --> 00:41:29.881
Oh, please. Will you explain to him?

604
00:41:29.882 --> 00:41:31.882
Oh, he knows it better than you do.

605
00:41:31.883 --> 00:41:36.783
Until the wedding you can't embrace her,
or kiss her, or anything.


606
00:41:36.784 --> 00:41:39.384
After the wedding she becomes your property.

607
00:41:39.385 --> 00:41:42.785
You make me sound like a landlord.
Certainly a little kiss.


608
00:41:42.786 --> 00:41:46.286
As far as they're concerned
there's no such thing as a little kiss.


609
00:41:46.287 --> 00:41:49.087
You'll just have to control yourself
till after the wedding.


610
00:41:49.088 --> 00:41:54.488
Then will you please explain to him
that all that's been arranged for next Tuesday.


611
00:42:01.389 --> 00:42:02.589
What's the matter?

612
00:42:02.590 --> 00:42:06.670
He says the date of the wedding has already been set
according to astronomical calculations.


613
00:42:06.671 --> 00:42:09.571
For when?
Three months from today.


614
00:42:09.572 --> 00:42:12.172
Three months? Why, that's ridiculous!

615
00:42:12.173 --> 00:42:15.973
It won't do you any good to argue with him.
Tell him I refuse to wait three months.


616
00:42:15.974 --> 00:42:19.874
There was nothing about the three months
in the arrangements.


617
00:42:19.875 --> 00:42:23.375
I don't believe in long engagements.
My whole family feels the same way.


618
00:42:23.376 --> 00:42:27.576
My grandfather and my grandmother were married
the same day they met.


619
00:42:27.577 --> 00:42:31.477
Good enough for them.
Three months! Do you realize that's ninety days?


620
00:42:31.478 --> 00:42:33.678
Do you know how many hours that is?

621
00:42:33.679 --> 00:42:35.679
Neither do I, but it
must be an awful lot.

622
00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:38.280
Three months. I won't stand for it.

623
00:42:38.281 --> 00:42:39.981
Three months. That's the end.

624
00:42:39.982 --> 00:42:40.982
Three...

625
00:42:43.283 --> 00:42:46.283
Oh, I don't know.
Three months of this might not be too bad.


626
00:43:33.584 --> 00:43:35.484
While I searched the book of love...

627
00:43:39.185 --> 00:43:42.585
a wise voice whispered happy is he...

628
00:43:51.286 --> 00:43:54.386
happy is he who holds
in his house a love...

629
00:43:59.887 --> 00:44:01.987
a love more lovely than the moon...

630
00:44:01.988 --> 00:44:03.788
and dreams...

631
00:44:09.889 --> 00:44:12.789
dreams of a lifetime longer than a year.

632
00:44:17.190 --> 00:44:18.690
Did she say that?

633
00:44:18.691 --> 00:44:20.691
Omar Khayyam said it.

634
00:44:25.392 --> 00:44:30.092
My love for you called you to me
across half the world.


635
00:44:30.993 --> 00:44:33.393
I'm so sorry. I didn't hear that.

636
00:44:35.594 --> 00:44:39.294
My love for you... I mean her, of course.
Yes.


637
00:44:39.395 --> 00:44:42.895
Has called you... I mean...
I understand who's who.


638
00:44:42.896 --> 00:44:44.596
Well, then, tell her yourself.

639
00:44:54.097 --> 00:44:55.397
What did you tell her?

640
00:44:55.398 --> 00:44:59.098
I said you wished
to cut your tongue out

641
00:44:59.099 --> 00:45:02.299
because you could not speak
your love for her in her own language.


642
00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:05.300
That's very good!

643
00:45:09.701 --> 00:45:11.801
Comfy?
Yeah, hm-hmm.


644
00:45:13.202 --> 00:45:16.602
After we're married, ask her how many er...
How many what?


645
00:45:17.203 --> 00:45:20.503
Never mind. I'll wait until she learns English.
I'll ask her that myself, thank you.


646
00:45:21.004 --> 00:45:25.104
Bukistanians believe in large families,
if that answers your question.


647
00:45:26.805 --> 00:45:28.605
Now wait a minute, just...

648
00:45:30.706 --> 00:45:32.006
Tarji, darling...

649
00:45:32.007 --> 00:45:33.977
Now listen, listen...

650
00:45:35.478 --> 00:45:39.578
Table... table...

651
00:45:41.579 --> 00:45:45.179
Table.
That's very... Oh, this is going to be a cinch.


652
00:45:45.180 --> 00:45:47.580
I don't think I'll
need you for the moment.

653
00:45:47.581 --> 00:45:49.481
Would you mind going
over to the corner, relaxing?

654
00:45:49.482 --> 00:45:51.482
That's a good girl.
Go somewhere, thank you.


655
00:45:52.783 --> 00:45:54.483
Good, Tarji. Humm...

656
00:45:55.984 --> 00:45:58.184
Couch... couch.

657
00:45:59.485 --> 00:46:02.285
Couch.
Yes, darling, couch.


658
00:46:02.286 --> 00:46:04.086
Yes, yes...
Couch.


659
00:46:04.087 --> 00:46:06.887
Uhm... Oh, ashtray, see?

660
00:46:06.888 --> 00:46:08.288
Ashtray.

661
00:46:08.689 --> 00:46:10.389
Ashtray see.

662
00:46:10.390 --> 00:46:13.390
Ashtray...
No, no, not the "see", dear, just the...


663
00:46:13.391 --> 00:46:14.991
Never mind. We'll get to that later.

664
00:46:17.392 --> 00:46:18.692
Fruit.

665
00:46:18.693 --> 00:46:19.793
Fruit.

666
00:46:20.194 --> 00:46:21.894
Fruit.

667
00:46:26.095 --> 00:46:27.795
Prune.

668
00:46:28.396 --> 00:46:30.196
Prune.

669
00:46:30.597 --> 00:46:32.097
Well, hmm...

670
00:46:33.098 --> 00:46:34.898
Prune.

671
00:46:35.699 --> 00:46:39.099
Prune.
That's better, but uh...


672
00:46:39.100 --> 00:46:41.700
Pruuuune,

673
00:46:42.301 --> 00:46:44.101
Pruuuune...
Katan!


674
00:46:44.702 --> 00:46:45.902
Katan!

675
00:46:47.702 --> 00:46:50.602
You big silly ox!
Here, catch.


676
00:46:50.603 --> 00:46:52.603
Now how long can a man stand this?

677
00:46:52.604 --> 00:46:56.474
In three months I'll be a nervous wreck.
What does he think he is, the Iron Curtain?


678
00:46:56.475 --> 00:46:58.375
He is until you're married.

679
00:46:58.376 --> 00:47:01.676
You tell him we're in America now.
There are certain customs that...


680
00:47:01.777 --> 00:47:05.277
What were you saying?
Uh, what was I saying? What, what?


681
00:47:05.278 --> 00:47:06.878
Something about customs.

682
00:47:06.879 --> 00:47:09.079
Oh, oh!

683
00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:11.980
Well, there are certain customs that are sacred.

684
00:47:11.981 --> 00:47:14.681
And I'm not the man to violate them.
I should say not.


685
00:47:14.682 --> 00:47:18.282
If they want to separate their boys and girls,
then I say separate them.


686
00:47:18.283 --> 00:47:20.783
What are three months?
Why, they go by like that.


687
00:47:20.784 --> 00:47:23.984
Clem!
Do you know the mark of a mature man?


688
00:47:23.985 --> 00:47:26.885
Patience. The ability to
wait for what he wants.

689
00:47:26.886 --> 00:47:29.086
That is the key to the situation.

690
00:47:29.687 --> 00:47:31.387
Well, I think I'll be running along.

691
00:47:31.388 --> 00:47:33.658
Give everybody a chance to get
a good night's sleep.


692
00:47:33.659 --> 00:47:36.959
I think that's a very good idea.
Yes, would you do me a favor?


693
00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:41.960
Would you please tell Tarji
that I'll see her very soon.

694
00:47:45.661 --> 00:47:47.961
She says her heart
will be unable to wait.

695
00:47:57.762 --> 00:48:00.262
May I drop you at your house?

696
00:48:00.263 --> 00:48:02.063
No, thanks. I think I'll get a cab.

697
00:48:02.064 --> 00:48:03.964
Well, good night all.

698
00:49:04.765 --> 00:49:06.265
Darling.

699
00:49:06.266 --> 00:49:08.166
Darling, I'm back.

700
00:49:09.067 --> 00:49:11.567
Oh, I wish I could
speak with you in your language.

701
00:49:11.568 --> 00:49:13.368
There's so much I want to tell you.

702
00:49:13.369 --> 00:49:16.669
But all you need to know
now is that I love you.

703
00:49:18.670 --> 00:49:22.979
It won't be easy to be patient but I want you to know
that I'll wait as long as necessary.


704
00:49:22.980 --> 00:49:25.180
And that I'll want you more each day.

705
00:49:25.181 --> 00:49:28.281
Darling, it seems I've waited
all my life for you.

706
00:49:28.282 --> 00:49:30.782
And in just a little while we...

707
00:49:31.783 --> 00:49:33.683
And in just a little while...

708
00:49:39.384 --> 00:49:41.684
Badabani.
Katan, katan!


709
00:49:42.284 --> 00:49:44.084
Shhh! You'll wake everyone up!

710
00:49:48.385 --> 00:49:49.385
Mr. Reade!

711
00:49:49.386 --> 00:49:52.186
I'm certainly not going to stay
in such a noisy hotel.


712
00:50:15.487 --> 00:50:17.487
You may go in now, Mr. Reade.

713
00:50:24.388 --> 00:50:28.038
With our deepest regrets and sincere assurance
to your excellency


714
00:50:28.039 --> 00:50:33.139
that there will not be a repetition of last night's er...
Last night's unfortunate incident.


715
00:50:33.740 --> 00:50:35.940
Good. How does the whole thing sound?

716
00:50:35.941 --> 00:50:38.341
Fine, I'll send it by special cable.

717
00:50:38.342 --> 00:50:40.242
Good morning, Romeo.
Yes, yes, yes...


718
00:50:40.243 --> 00:50:42.979
You sent for me?
Yes, sit down, Reade.


719
00:50:42.980 --> 00:50:45.080
Now you look here. 
I'm a citizen...

720
00:50:45.081 --> 00:50:48.081
And there are a few things
that I've got to make clear to you, citizen.


721
00:50:48.082 --> 00:50:51.682
The State Department has enough troubles
without worrying about your love life.


722
00:50:51.683 --> 00:50:53.979
As far as I'm concerned
you can have a harem.

723
00:50:53.980 --> 00:50:57.580
But when your irresponsible actions jeopardize
the functions of this Office


724
00:50:57.581 --> 00:50:59.681
then I'm going to crack down.

725
00:50:59.682 --> 00:51:01.979
You were warned about
this sort of thing, Reade.

726
00:51:01.980 --> 00:51:03.980
You're making a mountain
out of a mole hill.

727
00:51:03.981 --> 00:51:06.781
And you were told to keep away
from that mole hill until after you were married.


728
00:51:06.782 --> 00:51:09.682
Tarji is my fiancée. If I want to kiss her,
what do you expect me to do?


729
00:51:09.683 --> 00:51:11.443
Telephone the Secretary of State?

730
00:51:11.444 --> 00:51:15.344
Now look, Reade. I don't care to have the State Department
put in the position of playing Peeping Tom.


731
00:51:15.345 --> 00:51:18.745
But for the next three months you're going to behave
like Whistler's Mother.


732
00:51:18.746 --> 00:51:22.446
You stick to protocol
and we will not have any more trouble.


733
00:51:22.447 --> 00:51:26.547
Whistler's Mother?
Just remember what I told you. Don't get too friendly.


734
00:51:26.548 --> 00:51:28.948
Thank you. I'll remember.
Good!


735
00:51:28.949 --> 00:51:31.249
You forgot to give me the key.
I haven't any...


736
00:51:31.450 --> 00:51:32.550
key.

737
00:51:32.651 --> 00:51:34.951
I beg your pardon.

738
00:51:35.152 --> 00:51:37.352
I'll show myself out.

739
00:51:39.253 --> 00:51:41.653
Did you explain the
facts of life to him?

740
00:51:41.654 --> 00:51:45.080
He knows them. That's our problem.
Now that he understands, maybe...


741
00:51:45.081 --> 00:51:47.361
My dear Effie, you know all about countries,

742
00:51:47.362 --> 00:51:50.062
but there are a few things
you've got to learn about men.


743
00:51:50.063 --> 00:51:53.363
You are moving in with the princess tonight.

744
00:51:55.764 --> 00:51:57.464
Oh, Mr. Reade.

745
00:51:57.465 --> 00:51:59.965
Good evening.
I've been waiting to talk to you.


746
00:51:59.966 --> 00:52:02.366
Really? Anything wrong?
Yes.


747
00:52:02.367 --> 00:52:04.667
It's about that bearded gentleman.

748
00:52:04.668 --> 00:52:06.568
You mean our friend the skyscraper.

749
00:52:06.569 --> 00:52:09.169
He's been trying to buy our chambermaids.

750
00:52:10.370 --> 00:52:14.070
He has?
Yes, he's been offering them physicians in the Khan's harem.


751
00:52:14.071 --> 00:52:16.171
I hope he hasn't offended them.

752
00:52:16.172 --> 00:52:19.272
Offended them?
Six of the girls have already accepted.


753
00:52:20.273 --> 00:52:22.873
Well, I'll speak to Miss Effington about that.

754
00:52:33.074 --> 00:52:34.874
Good evening, Tarji.

755
00:52:37.075 --> 00:52:39.075
Oh, she shouldn't do that.

756
00:52:39.076 --> 00:52:40.576
You're telling me.

757
00:52:40.577 --> 00:52:43.677
Oh, yes, it's the
lady from the translation bureau.

758
00:52:43.678 --> 00:52:46.078
Why don't you run along and see
a French movie or something?


759
00:52:46.079 --> 00:52:50.379
This is better than a French movie.
There's a good chance I may not need you anymore.


760
00:53:01.180 --> 00:53:02.280
What's the matter, what...

761
00:53:02.281 --> 00:53:04.381
What are you trying to say?

762
00:53:04.382 --> 00:53:05.982
"Nonmoki"... you know...

763
00:53:07.983 --> 00:53:10.083
Oh, you mean "Monkomi Bukistani sabeh"

764
00:53:11.984 --> 00:53:13.184
Here, Katan, kattatch.

765
00:53:13.785 --> 00:53:16.085
That fellow catches everything, except pneumonia.

766
00:53:16.086 --> 00:53:18.786
Now that you're here
you might as well make yourself useful.


767
00:53:19.587 --> 00:53:23.587
Tell Tarji that she looks enchanting tonight.
And don't spare the adjectives.


768
00:53:27.988 --> 00:53:30.188
Yeah... here we go again.

769
00:53:34.389 --> 00:53:36.189
This is the life.

770
00:53:36.390 --> 00:53:39.490
You'd have been a
smash in the Middle Ages.

771
00:53:39.491 --> 00:53:41.291
Yes, yes, yes.

772
00:53:43.192 --> 00:53:47.492
Tell Tarji I've been longing
to see her all day.

773
00:53:47.493 --> 00:53:49.693
And put a little feeling into it.

774
00:53:57.294 --> 00:53:58.594
What did she say?

775
00:53:58.595 --> 00:54:02.095
She said there is no moon until you walk
into her presence.


776
00:54:02.096 --> 00:54:04.696
Oh, isn't that nice.

777
00:54:04.697 --> 00:54:07.497
Is there any answer, Moon Man?

778
00:55:22.998 --> 00:55:25.098
Tarji, now that we're alone...

779
00:55:25.099 --> 00:55:27.999
I want you to know how sorry I am
about the key last night.


780
00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:30.100
Key?
Yes, dear, the key.


781
00:55:30.101 --> 00:55:33.801
You see, I'm afraid it was
one of those unfortunate things...


782
00:55:33.802 --> 00:55:35.002
Key.

783
00:55:35.503 --> 00:55:37.603
No, no, darling...

784
00:55:37.604 --> 00:55:40.004
you don't understand. 
You keep this.

785
00:55:40.505 --> 00:55:41.705
See?

786
00:55:43.706 --> 00:55:46.506
No, I can't take the key.

787
00:55:46.507 --> 00:55:50.407
Key.
Tarji, you mustn't do this.


788
00:55:51.808 --> 00:55:54.208
Clem.
I'd love to, but we need oil.


789
00:55:54.209 --> 00:55:57.509
I mean, we'll have plenty
of time to be together.

790
00:55:57.510 --> 00:56:00.510
Right now, a little thing like a key seems important...
Key.


791
00:56:00.511 --> 00:56:03.011
But, but...

792
00:56:03.012 --> 00:56:07.912
Oh, Tarji...
I'm sorry about the interruption.


793
00:56:07.913 --> 00:56:11.513
One of the dancing girls discovered the telephone
and she won't get off it.


794
00:56:11.514 --> 00:56:13.914
She probably thinks she's an American woman.

795
00:56:13.915 --> 00:56:16.115
Shall I translate that for Tarji?

796
00:56:16.116 --> 00:56:19.016
No, no, let's wait for something funnier.

797
00:56:21.617 --> 00:56:24.687
Well, it's been a hard day...
You're not going already?


798
00:56:24.688 --> 00:56:27.538
Do you mind?
MacBride neglected to tell me my bedtime...


799
00:56:27.539 --> 00:56:30.339
but I'm sure the State Department won't object
if I retire early.


800
00:56:30.340 --> 00:56:33.340
May I drop you?
No, thanks, I'm going to stick around for a while.


801
00:56:33.341 --> 00:56:39.641
Tell Tarji that until I see her again
the birds will have no song.


802
00:56:39.642 --> 00:56:41.482
Oh, brother.
Now, look!


803
00:56:41.483 --> 00:56:43.683
All right, all right, the
birds will have no song.

804
00:56:52.384 --> 00:56:54.484
Well, good night.

805
00:56:55.685 --> 00:56:57.485
Oh, Moon Man...

806
00:56:58.386 --> 00:57:01.086
Hm?
You forgot your shoes.


807
00:57:55.187 --> 00:57:56.387
Darling.

808
00:57:56.388 --> 00:57:58.688
Darling, I'm back, I'm back!

809
00:57:58.689 --> 00:58:01.589
You see, nothing can ever keep us apart.

810
00:58:01.890 --> 00:58:05.890
Not the State Department, nor protocol,
nor Effie.


811
00:58:05.891 --> 00:58:07.591
Especially Effie.

812
00:58:07.592 --> 00:58:12.492
We will be rid of them soon
and your little moon man will be all yours.


813
00:58:12.493 --> 00:58:15.493
Oh, it seems I've waited
all my life for you.

814
00:58:15.494 --> 00:58:18.494
I never loved anyone
before I met you, dear.

815
00:58:19.595 --> 00:58:22.395
I'm afraid I must go now
so there won't be any trouble.


816
00:58:22.396 --> 00:58:25.196
But just one kiss before I leave...

817
00:58:27.797 --> 00:58:30.297
Oh, there you are!
I've been looking everywhere for you.


818
00:58:42.698 --> 00:58:44.298
I know, I can go in now.

819
00:58:52.299 --> 00:58:54.899
Oh, you're not MacBride, he's taller.
Where's he?


820
00:58:54.900 --> 00:58:57.500
On the phone trying
to explain you to Washington.

821
00:58:57.501 --> 00:59:01.301
I know you won't believe this, but I only
went back there to give her a good night kiss.


822
00:59:01.302 --> 00:59:03.802
I didn't expect to start a riot.
Look at that?


823
00:59:03.903 --> 00:59:05.603
Where'd you get the key?

824
00:59:06.704 --> 00:59:08.304
I found it.

825
00:59:08.305 --> 00:59:11.005
At least you're a chivalrous liar.

826
00:59:11.006 --> 00:59:14.106
Tarji told me she gave you the key.
She thought you were asking for it.


827
00:59:14.107 --> 00:59:15.907
I was asking for it, all right.

828
00:59:15.908 --> 00:59:18.208
I wish I could
explain Tarji to you, Clem.

829
00:59:18.209 --> 00:59:21.909
Her only concern is to please you.
That's the way she was brought up.


830
00:59:21.910 --> 00:59:24.110
Any whim of yours is law to her.

831
00:59:24.111 --> 00:59:27.011
That's a terrible power to hold over anybody.

832
00:59:27.012 --> 00:59:30.112
No one will ever hold that power over you,
will they, Effie?


833
00:59:30.113 --> 00:59:32.213
We're not discussing me.

834
00:59:32.214 --> 00:59:35.314
Oh, well, citizen.
Hi.


835
00:59:35.315 --> 00:59:36.915
You're becoming quite a problem.

836
00:59:36.916 --> 00:59:40.416
Oh, not really, I'm just a normal, high-spirited
American boy.


837
00:59:40.417 --> 00:59:43.317
We're going to see if
we can control those high spirits.

838
00:59:43.318 --> 00:59:47.518
I don't know why I have to feel like Benedict Arnold
every time I want to kiss the girl I'm going to marry.


839
00:59:47.519 --> 00:59:50.519
The American people have stood
for inflation and high taxes


840
00:59:50.520 --> 00:59:54.220
but let Washington try to control everything
and you'll have a revolution.


841
00:59:54.221 --> 00:59:55.921
Well, I'll remember.

842
00:59:55.922 --> 00:59:59.822
Miss Effington tells me that you're not entirely
to blame for last night.


843
00:59:59.823 --> 01:00:01.123
She did?

844
01:00:01.124 --> 01:00:04.724
She came up with a very excellent suggestion.
We've just cabled to Bukistan...


845
01:00:04.725 --> 01:00:08.525
for permission to have the wedding right away.
Well, now we're getting somewhere.


846
01:00:08.526 --> 01:00:11.226
I thought it would serve
the best interests of everyone.

847
01:00:11.227 --> 01:00:12.427
I never doubted it.

848
01:00:12.428 --> 01:00:16.268
Now, there's to be a reception for Tarji
tonight at the Bukistanian Consulate.


849
01:00:16.269 --> 01:00:19.729
You're welcome to invite your friends.
Oh, really, you're too kind.


850
01:00:19.730 --> 01:00:24.260
Technically you'll be on Bukistanian soil this evening
so you'll be expected to behave accordingly.


851
01:00:24.261 --> 01:00:28.161
You can always count on me.
I'll be there to explain their customs to you.


852
01:00:28.162 --> 01:00:30.162
I had a feeling you'd be there.

853
01:00:30.163 --> 01:00:31.763
Have you had a
chance to look at that?

854
01:00:31.764 --> 01:00:33.664
Well, I'll see you at the party tonight,
is that right?


855
01:00:33.665 --> 01:00:36.565
We'll need their approval on this.
We'll meet over there, huh?


856
01:00:36.566 --> 01:00:40.066
This pertains to Raffidat.
Yeah, well, Raffidat.


857
01:00:44.467 --> 01:00:46.587
Where is she?
You'll meet her.


858
01:00:46.588 --> 01:00:49.688
Here, put my gloves in your pocket.
But, darling, I'm already carrying your compact.


859
01:00:49.689 --> 01:00:51.189
Do as I tell you.

860
01:00:52.090 --> 01:00:53.290
There she is.

861
01:00:56.791 --> 01:00:58.791
Good evening, Clem.
Hello, Eff.


862
01:00:58.792 --> 01:01:00.192
Good evening, Tarji.

863
01:01:00.193 --> 01:01:03.493
Hey, did you see that?
I certainly did.


864
01:01:04.294 --> 01:01:06.294
Tell her that she looks like a goddess.

865
01:01:09.295 --> 01:01:11.495
Why don't you say those things to me?

866
01:01:12.596 --> 01:01:15.196
I think you know everyone here.
Would you introduce them, please?


867
01:01:28.797 --> 01:01:30.897
Oh, thank heavens, 
I'm so thirsty I could die.

868
01:01:30.898 --> 01:01:34.698
Don't! You mustn't touch that.
The drinks are just for the men.


869
01:01:34.699 --> 01:01:36.699
I'm afraid I don't understand.

870
01:01:36.700 --> 01:01:38.800
I explained it to Clem this afternoon.

871
01:01:38.801 --> 01:01:43.979
This is the Bukistanian Consulate and there are certain
strict customs which we are expected to observe.


872
01:01:43.980 --> 01:01:45.580
Well, I never!

873
01:01:47.381 --> 01:01:48.581
Thank you, Tarji.

874
01:01:48.582 --> 01:01:50.682
Now, gentlemen, help yourselves.

875
01:01:51.783 --> 01:01:53.683
Well, very nice, thank you.

876
01:01:53.684 --> 01:01:56.184
Well, to the ladies.

877
01:01:56.185 --> 01:01:58.385
I never heard of such a thing.

878
01:01:58.386 --> 01:02:01.786
When in Rome, Jean...
Don't you dare enjoy that.


879
01:02:02.687 --> 01:02:03.979
No, darling.

880
01:02:03.980 --> 01:02:06.680
What else can't the Bukistanian women do?

881
01:02:06.681 --> 01:02:09.081
Oh, they can do everything. 
And do it better.

882
01:02:09.082 --> 01:02:10.782
How do you know?
Uh...


883
01:02:17.183 --> 01:02:18.683
Thank you, Tarji.

884
01:02:28.484 --> 01:02:30.984
That means dinner is served.

885
01:02:30.985 --> 01:02:32.885
Good, I'm starved.
Wait!


886
01:02:32.886 --> 01:02:36.686
Would you walk three paces behind
your husbands, please?


887
01:02:36.687 --> 01:02:39.687
Well, these fellows really live, eh?

888
01:02:47.188 --> 01:02:50.088
I'm sorry. This table is for the men.

889
01:02:50.089 --> 01:02:52.389
Do you mean to say
I can't eat with my husband?

890
01:02:52.390 --> 01:02:56.090
In Bukistan the women do not eat with the men.
They eat separately at their own table.


891
01:02:56.091 --> 01:02:57.891
The women will eat over there.

892
01:03:02.892 --> 01:03:04.892
How far did you
say it is to Bukistan?

893
01:03:04.893 --> 01:03:08.173
Clem, I've never seen anything like Tarji.
I thought you were exaggerating.


894
01:03:08.174 --> 01:03:10.074
She's incredible.

895
01:03:10.075 --> 01:03:12.275
If I ever treated May
that way, she'd shoot me.

896
01:03:12.276 --> 01:03:15.276
Clem, how did you train
her to light your cigarette?

897
01:03:15.277 --> 01:03:18.077
I didn't train her.
She's not a trick dog.


898
01:03:18.078 --> 01:03:20.878
All she cares about is whether I'm happy.
It's a natural instinct.


899
01:03:20.879 --> 01:03:23.979
Some instinct.
Tell us about some of her other instincts.


900
01:03:23.980 --> 01:03:25.880
You haven't seen anything yet.

901
01:03:25.881 --> 01:03:29.971
I can't wait.
Hey, delicious, what is it?


902
01:03:29.972 --> 01:03:31.672
Goat meat.

903
01:03:40.073 --> 01:03:42.973
Oh, dear. You know, 
I'm getting tired of all this.

904
01:03:42.974 --> 01:03:45.674
All these crowds all the time.
Nothing but people.


905
01:03:45.675 --> 01:03:47.875
What exactly did you have in mind?

906
01:03:47.876 --> 01:03:49.476
Anything.

907
01:03:49.477 --> 01:03:53.177
I'd just like to be alone with Tarji sometime.
Just alone with her.


908
01:03:53.178 --> 01:03:55.578
We could go walking somewhere.

909
01:03:56.079 --> 01:04:00.679
We might even go walking in the park.
If you're planning on disappearing with her, forget it.


910
01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:01.680
Effie!

911
01:04:01.681 --> 01:04:05.181
When you're out with Tarji there are certain
protocol that must be observed.


912
01:04:05.182 --> 01:04:07.382
Of course.
And we will observe it.


913
01:04:07.383 --> 01:04:09.283
Together.
Ughh.


914
01:04:09.284 --> 01:04:12.084
Tomorrow we can go for
a nice walk in the park.

915
01:04:12.085 --> 01:04:14.785
Now, lie down, Bonzo. 
It's feeding time.

916
01:05:53.986 --> 01:05:57.786
Oh, for heaven's sakes. Will you tell her
she's in America now? She can't go on like this.


917
01:05:57.787 --> 01:06:01.977
But this is what you wanted, isn't it?
Certainly not. She's like Brutus.


918
01:06:01.978 --> 01:06:05.678
Darling, you eat with me.

919
01:06:05.679 --> 01:06:08.379
We eat together.

920
01:06:08.380 --> 01:06:11.080
Ashtray?
Oh...


921
01:06:11.081 --> 01:06:12.581
Explain it to her, will you?

922
01:06:12.582 --> 01:06:16.282
It's going to be pretty difficult.
I'm doing 3000 years of history, but I'll try.


923
01:06:16.283 --> 01:06:18.979
Just tell her that now... now...

924
01:06:21.480 --> 01:06:23.180
She adores me.

925
01:06:26.281 --> 01:06:29.581
Good morning, sir, or madam,

926
01:06:29.582 --> 01:06:32.582
or a small child...

927
01:06:32.583 --> 01:06:37.483
...as the case may be.
As the case may be. That's very good, Tarji. Go on.


928
01:06:37.484 --> 01:06:45.484
In the morning I
have breakfast with my brother...

929
01:06:45.485 --> 01:06:47.985
John.
Hm-hmm.


930
01:06:48.986 --> 01:06:50.886
Why Clem angry?

931
01:06:50.887 --> 01:06:56.387
Angry?
Yes, he not do like me anymore.


932
01:06:56.388 --> 01:07:00.288
Ah, it isn't that, Tarji. 
In America it's different.

933
01:07:00.289 --> 01:07:03.289
Women walk with their
husbands and eat with them.

934
01:07:03.290 --> 01:07:09.490
American women are proud. They fought
for their freedom and they've become a part of history.


935
01:07:09.979 --> 01:07:13.691
Women like Harriet Beecher Stowe and Amelia Bloomer.

936
01:07:13.692 --> 01:07:17.492
Bloomer?
Yes, Bloomer.


937
01:07:18.493 --> 01:07:19.893
Bloomer.

938
01:07:21.294 --> 01:07:23.094
Tell me, Bloomer.

939
01:07:23.095 --> 01:07:24.980
Well...

940
01:07:37.481 --> 01:07:42.781
Clara Barton started American Red Cross.
Yes... Now what has that to do with any...


941
01:07:42.782 --> 01:07:44.282
Good night.

942
01:07:46.883 --> 01:07:48.983
Badabani.

943
01:08:04.784 --> 01:08:06.384
It's been quite an evening.

944
01:08:07.285 --> 01:08:09.785
Wee!
Wee!


945
01:08:09.786 --> 01:08:12.486
Darling, fetch me a drink.

946
01:08:12.487 --> 01:08:16.387
No ice, a twitch of
lemon and easy on the water.

947
01:08:16.488 --> 01:08:18.288
No, no, you've had enough.

948
01:08:18.289 --> 01:08:20.289
Put her to bed. 
I'll see her tomorrow.

949
01:08:26.390 --> 01:08:28.490
Oh, my goodness. 
She's high as a kite.

950
01:08:28.491 --> 01:08:31.191
Flown by Benjamin Franklin, a man.

951
01:08:31.892 --> 01:08:34.092
Good night, Mrs. Frankenstein.

952
01:09:08.393 --> 01:09:09.593
For me?

953
01:09:20.394 --> 01:09:21.694
Thank you.

954
01:09:24.295 --> 01:09:26.495
Hey, you!
That's okay, I'll take care of her.


955
01:09:26.496 --> 01:09:27.896
Hey, wait a minute.

956
01:09:28.297 --> 01:09:30.197
You forgot to pay
for your drink back there.

957
01:09:30.198 --> 01:09:32.798
Pay?
Sure, you don't get anything for nothing, you know.


958
01:09:32.799 --> 01:09:34.499
But that's all right. 
I took care of it myself.

959
01:09:34.500 --> 01:09:37.400
You ate very friendlike.

960
01:09:37.401 --> 01:09:40.801
I was hoping you'd look at it that way.
I wouldn't want you to think I was one of those fresh guys.


961
01:09:40.802 --> 01:09:43.602
Fresh? What is fresh?

962
01:09:43.603 --> 01:09:45.503
That's what I always say.
What is fresh?


963
01:09:45.204 --> 01:09:48.204
What's the matter whether you introduce yourself
or somebody else does it for you.


964
01:09:48.305 --> 01:09:51.605
My name's George Seegley. What's yours?
Tarji.


965
01:09:51.606 --> 01:09:55.106
You live around here, honey?
I live in big hotel.


966
01:09:55.107 --> 01:09:56.107
Oh.

967
01:09:56.708 --> 01:09:59.708
See?
You certainly do.


968
01:09:59.709 --> 01:10:01.509
Are you free tonight?

969
01:10:01.510 --> 01:10:04.910
Of course. I am
free woman all the time.

970
01:10:23.811 --> 01:10:25.811
What do you mean you
told her she could go out?

971
01:10:25.812 --> 01:10:29.012
I don't like the idea of her roaming
around the streets all by herself.


972
01:10:29.013 --> 01:10:32.313
She just went for a little walk.
Now, what could possibly happen?


973
01:10:32.314 --> 01:10:35.214
She's not a child, Clem.
She can take care of herself.


974
01:10:35.215 --> 01:10:38.685
I don't like it. She's changed.
And it's all your fault.


975
01:10:38.686 --> 01:10:40.286
It's time someone freed her.

976
01:10:40.287 --> 01:10:42.887
Oh, look, Pygmalion.
Pygmalion was a man.


977
01:10:42.888 --> 01:10:44.388
Don't tempt me.

978
01:10:44.389 --> 01:10:48.089
Oh, don't you understand, Clem?
She's like a kid with a new television set.


979
01:10:48.090 --> 01:10:50.190
She's learned a new word, freedom.

980
01:10:50.191 --> 01:10:52.791
And now she's just
fiddling with all the knobs.

981
01:10:52.792 --> 01:10:56.192
After you're married she'll settle down
and be everything you want her to be.


982
01:10:56.193 --> 01:10:59.193
After we're married?
By that time I'll be in a wheelchair.


983
01:10:59.194 --> 01:11:01.394
Have you heard from the Khan
about our wedding yet?


984
01:11:01.395 --> 01:11:03.895
We've been notified to expect an answer today.

985
01:11:03.896 --> 01:11:08.596
And while we're at it I think there are one or two things
I'd better explain to you about the wedding ceremony.


986
01:11:08.597 --> 01:11:10.497
And what happens afterwards.

987
01:11:10.498 --> 01:11:12.798
Isn't anything sacred?

988
01:11:12.799 --> 01:11:14.999
Everything. That's what I want
to talk to you about.

989
01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:19.200
Evelyn, I'll have to cancel my 3 o'clock appointment.
And tell Gregorovitch I won't need him.


990
01:11:19.201 --> 01:11:21.501
Who's Gregorovitch?
He's a spy.


991
01:11:21.502 --> 01:11:24.302
Oh!
Now, let's begin at the beginning.


992
01:11:24.303 --> 01:11:27.703
The wedding ceremony itself lasts for three days.

993
01:11:27.704 --> 01:11:30.604
And it's called the "huffi".
I don't care what it's called.


994
01:11:30.605 --> 01:11:32.205
And then what happens?

995
01:11:32.206 --> 01:11:36.306
Well, the ceremony consists of feasting,
dancing and incantations.


996
01:11:36.307 --> 01:11:40.107
Since Tarji is a princess, the honeymoon
will last eight weeks.


997
01:11:40.108 --> 01:11:43.008
It's called the "broukha".

998
01:11:43.009 --> 01:11:44.909
Don't wear bow ties.

999
01:11:44.910 --> 01:11:48.710
Now, during the "broukha"...
Wait a minute... what's that? What did you say?


1000
01:11:48.711 --> 01:11:52.611
I said during the broukha...
No, about the bow ties.


1001
01:11:52.612 --> 01:11:54.212
Oh, don't wear them.

1002
01:11:54.213 --> 01:11:58.213
You mean to say there's some kind of Bukistanian law
about bow ties?


1003
01:11:58.214 --> 01:12:00.814
No, it's just that you don't look very good in them,
that's all.


1004
01:12:00.815 --> 01:12:03.515
Now, during the broukha...
Whoa, wait a minute...


1005
01:12:03.516 --> 01:12:06.816
You always said you
liked me in bow ties.

1006
01:12:06.817 --> 01:12:09.017
You always wore them what could I say?

1007
01:12:09.018 --> 01:12:13.018
Well, that's a fine thing.
May I explain the broukha?


1008
01:12:13.019 --> 01:12:15.519
Never mind the broukha.
What else?


1009
01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:18.250
What else what?
What else didn't you like about me?


1010
01:12:18.251 --> 01:12:22.381
I think it's rather pointless to reminisce about
our likes and dislikes when we were engaged.


1011
01:12:22.382 --> 01:12:23.979
No, I'd like to hear it.

1012
01:12:23.980 --> 01:12:26.280
Oh, it's nothing important, just little things.

1013
01:12:26.281 --> 01:12:28.381
Like your salad dressing.

1014
01:12:29.682 --> 01:12:32.182
Why, you loved my salad dressing.

1015
01:12:32.183 --> 01:12:33.583
Well, didn't you?

1016
01:12:33.584 --> 01:12:38.784
If every woman told the man she's going to marry
what she really thinks, this would be a nation of old maids.


1017
01:12:39.785 --> 01:12:42.485
I wouldn't mind if your criticism was justified.

1018
01:12:42.486 --> 01:12:45.186
Perhaps I should have
told you about your hats.

1019
01:12:45.587 --> 01:12:49.567
It so happens that my salad dressing...
What about my hats?


1020
01:12:49.568 --> 01:12:51.668
Nothing. It happens that my salad dressing...

1021
01:12:51.669 --> 01:12:53.569
What about my hats?

1022
01:12:53.570 --> 01:12:56.940
Well, if you really want to know,
they're the most ridiculous hats I've ever seen.


1023
01:12:56.941 --> 01:13:00.441
They all look like crackerjack prizes.
But did I complain? No...


1024
01:13:00.442 --> 01:13:03.742
You used to compliment me on my hats.
Isn't that what you wanted me to do?


1025
01:13:03.743 --> 01:13:05.743
Not if it wasn't sincere.

1026
01:13:05.744 --> 01:13:08.144
We shouldn't even discuss it now.

1027
01:13:08.145 --> 01:13:10.945
It seems to me we ought to get back
to the broukha.


1028
01:13:10.946 --> 01:13:13.046
What else?
What else what?


1029
01:13:13.047 --> 01:13:17.447
Since my hats were so ridiculous I'm sure there were
other things you found equally ridiculous.


1030
01:13:17.448 --> 01:13:20.248
All right, now that you're asking,
your perfume.


1031
01:13:20.249 --> 01:13:24.449
It happens to be very good perfume.
What do you call it? Protocol Number 5?


1032
01:13:24.450 --> 01:13:28.250
How dare you?
You always used to ask me to put it on.


1033
01:13:28.251 --> 01:13:30.251
What was I going to do?
Ask you to take it off?


1034
01:13:30.552 --> 01:13:32.252
What else?

1035
01:13:32.253 --> 01:13:35.553
Your lipstick. 
I always got smeared.

1036
01:13:35.554 --> 01:13:37.554
If you knew how to kiss.

1037
01:13:38.755 --> 01:13:40.755
Now wait a minute!

1038
01:13:40.756 --> 01:13:44.256
The first time I kissed you
you told me it was like an earthquake.


1039
01:13:44.257 --> 01:13:48.857
Did I?
Oh, I see, It was like my salad dressing.


1040
01:13:48.858 --> 01:13:51.158
It was pleasant.
Hm... pleasant.


1041
01:13:52.359 --> 01:13:53.859
Let's see.

1042
01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:06.660
No earthquake.
Hm... forget I did it.


1043
01:14:06.661 --> 01:14:08.161
That won't be difficult.

1044
01:14:08.162 --> 01:14:11.562
Hmm... give my regards to Gregorovitch.

1045
01:14:17.063 --> 01:14:19.863
Mr. MacBride has asked me to give you this.
It's just arrived.


1046
01:14:21.764 --> 01:14:25.764
The Khan has agreed to hold the wedding next week
when we sign the oil agreement.


1047
01:14:26.565 --> 01:14:27.765
Thanks, Pat.

1048
01:14:36.766 --> 01:14:40.866
Evelyn, get out Givney's report for me
and have Ben call me on Monday.


1049
01:14:40.867 --> 01:14:43.667
Then get me Francis Gordon in Washington...

1050
01:14:50.068 --> 01:14:51.568
Earthquake! It's an...

1051
01:14:58.269 --> 01:14:59.889
Oh, no!

1052
01:15:06.390 --> 01:15:07.979
Did you feel s shaking?

1053
01:15:08.091 --> 01:15:11.991
No, sir. Maybe it's a vibration from the service elevator.
It gets pretty strong sometimes.


1054
01:15:12.292 --> 01:15:13.792
Oh...

1055
01:15:19.993 --> 01:15:21.093
Well...

1056
01:15:24.794 --> 01:15:26.194
Thank you.

1057
01:15:26.195 --> 01:15:28.195
Would you like some more ice?

1058
01:15:28.196 --> 01:15:31.196
Oh, no, don't trouble.
It's no trouble at all.


1059
01:15:34.497 --> 01:15:37.897
Well, I think I'll
recite a little poetry tonight.

1060
01:15:37.898 --> 01:15:40.798
What will it be?
Anything that pleases you.


1061
01:15:41.699 --> 01:15:44.199
How about Keats? 
He's always good.

1062
01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:50.000
A thing of beauty is a joy forever.

1063
01:15:50.001 --> 01:15:52.980
Its loveliness increases...

1064
01:15:54.081 --> 01:15:56.481
It's not very romantic, is it?
I like it.


1065
01:15:57.982 --> 01:16:01.782
I learned new thing today.
That's fine! Tell Clem.


1066
01:16:01.783 --> 01:16:04.383
I open charges account.

1067
01:16:05.184 --> 01:16:07.684
I go in many stores. 
They are very nice.

1068
01:16:07.685 --> 01:16:10.885
Macy, Gimble, Sak.

1069
01:16:10.886 --> 01:16:13.686
One store much fun. Many games.

1070
01:16:13.687 --> 01:16:15.487
Games?
Yes.


1071
01:16:15.488 --> 01:16:20.088
You put money in and you win sandwich,
soup, coffee.


1072
01:16:20.089 --> 01:16:21.789
I win all time.

1073
01:16:21.790 --> 01:16:24.380
That's the automat.
Automat.


1074
01:16:24.381 --> 01:16:25.381
Yes...

1075
01:16:25.582 --> 01:16:27.282
Doorbell. I go.

1076
01:16:31.683 --> 01:16:34.483
Hiya, honey! I bet you thought
I wasn't gonna make it, didn't you?


1077
01:16:34.484 --> 01:16:35.979
Hello, George. Come in.

1078
01:16:36.980 --> 01:16:40.380
Oh, a double date. I'm mighty glad to meet you.
My name is George Seegley.


1079
01:16:40.381 --> 01:16:42.781
Really?
George my friend. Very fresh.


1080
01:16:42.782 --> 01:16:45.182
Is that so?
I think there must be some mistake.


1081
01:16:46.083 --> 01:16:47.083
I'll get it.

1082
01:16:47.084 --> 01:16:49.584
Oh, man, this is crazy!

1083
01:16:50.685 --> 01:16:52.685
I'll get to you later. 
Where's the doll?

1084
01:16:54.186 --> 01:16:55.386
Doll!

1085
01:16:55.987 --> 01:16:57.687
Who is he?
Louis.


1086
01:16:57.688 --> 01:16:59.388
I happen to have a
date with this young lady.

1087
01:16:59.389 --> 01:17:02.979
Yeah, well so do I.
Wait a minute. Nobody has a date with this lady.


1088
01:17:02.980 --> 01:17:04.430
I have a date with this lady.

1089
01:17:04.431 --> 01:17:07.131
This dame does the land office business.
Where did you meet her?


1090
01:17:07.132 --> 01:17:09.732
If it's any of your concern, 
I met her in Bukistan.

1091
01:17:09.733 --> 01:17:12.333
Tarji, I think you should
explain things to these gentlemen.

1092
01:17:12.334 --> 01:17:14.534
Now why don't you
just run along, huh, fellows?

1093
01:17:14.535 --> 01:17:16.535
Look, bud, why don't you go out
and get a girl of your own?


1094
01:17:16.536 --> 01:17:18.236
Yeah, and that goes for you, too.

1095
01:17:18.237 --> 01:17:20.437
Go away!
Who do you think you're cutting in on?


1096
01:17:20.438 --> 01:17:22.638
Tarji!
Dicky!


1097
01:17:22.639 --> 01:17:24.639
Get your coat, honey. 
We're going dancing.

1098
01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:27.940
Who's he?
He promised to teach Tarji jitterbug.


1099
01:17:27.941 --> 01:17:30.841
What am I supposed to do?
Why don't you join the marines?


1100
01:17:30.842 --> 01:17:33.842
Sorry, I must have the wrong... Tarji!

1101
01:17:33.843 --> 01:17:36.143
Scotty!
What is this, a convention?


1102
01:17:36.144 --> 01:17:37.944
Hey, you don't have any shoes on.

1103
01:17:37.945 --> 01:17:40.945
I know!
Tarji, where did you meet all these people?


1104
01:17:40.946 --> 01:17:42.856
I bought her an orange drink.
We went walking in the park.


1105
01:17:42.857 --> 01:17:44.757
I bought her a banana split.
I met her in the movies.


1106
01:17:44.758 --> 01:17:47.480
With Lana Turner.
How did you find time to go to the automat?


1107
01:17:47.481 --> 01:17:50.381
I beg your pardon, but I...
Oh, Tarji!


1108
01:17:50.382 --> 01:17:51.882
Uncle Clarence.

1109
01:17:52.083 --> 01:17:54.480
Uncle Clarence?
We were just leaving, Unc.


1110
01:17:54.481 --> 01:17:56.581
Look, I met her first, fellows,
so if you all don't mind running along.


1111
01:17:56.582 --> 01:17:58.702
Are you kidding?
Come on, Tarji, we're going dancing.


1112
01:17:58.703 --> 01:18:01.103
Imagine! I'm taking her to a nightclub.
I'll toss you all out.


1113
01:18:01.104 --> 01:18:02.304
Gentlemen!
Come on, honey.


1114
01:18:02.305 --> 01:18:05.080
Now wait a minute!
Nobody is taking no one nowhere.


1115
01:18:05.081 --> 01:18:07.591
I don't believe we've met.
I'll attend to you in a minute.


1116
01:18:07.592 --> 01:18:10.192
Now listen, my friend.
Butt out, chum!


1117
01:18:10.193 --> 01:18:12.280
Who are you pushing?

1118
01:18:12.281 --> 01:18:14.081
You, chum!

1119
01:18:25.980 --> 01:18:27.482
Oh, big fight!

1120
01:18:31.983 --> 01:18:33.183
Clem, be careful!

1121
01:18:34.484 --> 01:18:37.384
Ouch! What did you do that for?
That's my shoe!


1122
01:18:38.885 --> 01:18:40.685
You wait till I find my shoe!

1123
01:19:00.486 --> 01:19:01.786
Oh, look out!

1124
01:19:04.487 --> 01:19:06.387
I'll come back and do the room later.

1125
01:19:11.088 --> 01:19:12.988
Stop it! Stop it!

1126
01:19:16.589 --> 01:19:17.979
Hello!
Oh, hello.


1127
01:19:17.980 --> 01:19:19.680
They're not even registered.

1128
01:19:19.681 --> 01:19:22.581
Hello, this is Bob. Signal red! Signal red!

1129
01:19:22.582 --> 01:19:24.282
Never mind that! 
Help me find my other shoe.

1130
01:19:24.283 --> 01:19:26.883
What? Where are you going?
Wait...


1131
01:19:52.284 --> 01:19:53.784
There is a young lady to see you.

1132
01:19:53.785 --> 01:19:55.185
I do not need any.

1133
01:19:56.186 --> 01:19:58.486
Do I?
No, Your Excellency.


1134
01:19:58.487 --> 01:19:59.787
Who is she?

1135
01:20:02.588 --> 01:20:03.888
Effington?

1136
01:20:04.789 --> 01:20:06.179
Send her in.

1137
01:20:08.080 --> 01:20:11.080
She dares to face me
after what she's done to the princess.


1138
01:20:11.081 --> 01:20:13.181
We shall see.

1139
01:20:14.782 --> 01:20:16.979
Your Excellency.
Never mind that.


1140
01:20:16.980 --> 01:20:20.580
You are the American friend of my daughter.
I have that honor.


1141
01:20:20.581 --> 01:20:23.481
The one who has filled her mind
with your Western nonsense.


1142
01:20:24.282 --> 01:20:27.382
Why are you here?
I am from the State Department.


1143
01:20:27.383 --> 01:20:29.283
Indeed?

1144
01:20:29.584 --> 01:20:33.184
Your country is foolish to allow women
to meddle in government.


1145
01:20:33.185 --> 01:20:36.885
The coach of State cannot be driven
from the back seat.


1146
01:20:38.986 --> 01:20:40.886
That is excellent. 
Make a note of it.

1147
01:20:40.887 --> 01:20:42.387
Excellent!

1148
01:20:42.388 --> 01:20:46.688
I came to speak about the princess Tarji
and Mr. Reade, Your Excellency.


1149
01:20:46.689 --> 01:20:49.080
Their marriage means very much.
There will be no marriage.


1150
01:20:49.081 --> 01:20:51.481
If Tour Excellency will listen, I...
We can read!


1151
01:20:52.282 --> 01:20:54.682
The princess involved in a public scandal.

1152
01:20:54.683 --> 01:20:59.183
It's a disgrace.
In the rest of the world women know their place.


1153
01:20:59.184 --> 01:21:02.084
In your country women have forgotten
to be women.


1154
01:21:02.085 --> 01:21:05.885
American women are not mothers. 
They're fathers.

1155
01:21:06.986 --> 01:21:08.886
I will not let
my daughter become a father.

1156
01:21:08.887 --> 01:21:11.887
Oh, she isn't going to be... I mean.
I shall see to it.


1157
01:21:12.388 --> 01:21:16.588
She will not remain in this country and be blinded
to what a woman should be.


1158
01:21:17.489 --> 01:21:20.689
One sees with the heart, not the eyes.

1159
01:21:24.990 --> 01:21:26.790
You speak Bukistanian.

1160
01:21:27.491 --> 01:21:30.991
I speak all the important languages, 
Your Excellency.

1161
01:21:30.992 --> 01:21:33.892
And what you say is
true of some American women.

1162
01:21:33.893 --> 01:21:36.893
But that is because we need guidance.

1163
01:21:36.894 --> 01:21:40.894
The guidance of men
who are wise and strong.

1164
01:21:41.980 --> 01:21:44.995
Men who can make women
what they were meant to be.

1165
01:21:45.696 --> 01:21:47.196
As it is written...

1166
01:21:50.297 --> 01:21:53.497
One of my own quotations.
I know.


1167
01:22:06.898 --> 01:22:07.898
Araq!

1168
01:22:10.698 --> 01:22:12.698
A native wine made from rice.

1169
01:22:16.999 --> 01:22:19.359
I have good news, Your Excellency.
The princess has returned.


1170
01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:20.960
She can wait.

1171
01:22:20.961 --> 01:22:23.871
The araq is pleasing to you?
Oh, yes.


1172
01:22:23.872 --> 01:22:24.872
Good.

1173
01:22:29.773 --> 01:22:31.673
To the bride and groom.

1174
01:22:36.474 --> 01:22:38.474
You American women.

1175
01:22:43.775 --> 01:22:46.475
Yes, that's Effie, all right.
Always there when you need her.


1176
01:22:46.476 --> 01:22:49.376
Remarkable girl.
You know, I remember one summer...


1177
01:22:53.677 --> 01:22:55.277
Oh, dear me, he was
in a hurry, wasn't he?

1178
01:22:55.278 --> 01:22:57.578
The Khan cannot see me tonight.

1179
01:22:57.579 --> 01:23:01.479
He does not wish to be disturbed until morning.
Oh, never mind, dear...


1180
01:23:01.980 --> 01:23:03.780
Morning?
What's wrong?


1181
01:23:03.781 --> 01:23:05.281
Well, Effie's in there!

1182
01:23:05.282 --> 01:23:08.282
They won't let you go in.
Let them try to stop me.


1183
01:23:10.983 --> 01:23:13.083
Katan! Katan!
Oh, please...


1184
01:23:14.084 --> 01:23:16.184
Effie! Effie! I'm here, I'm...

1185
01:23:18.985 --> 01:23:22.385
Are you all right?
Does he always enter a room like that?


1186
01:23:23.286 --> 01:23:26.186
Forgive him. He was eager to see you,
Your Excellency.


1187
01:23:26.187 --> 01:23:30.587
Yes, Your Excellency, I was eager to see you.
You are welcome, my son. You may join us.


1188
01:23:30.788 --> 01:23:32.088
Thank you, sir.

1189
01:23:36.789 --> 01:23:40.489
How are you doing?
I have him eating out of my hand.


1190
01:23:43.390 --> 01:23:44.590
Sweet meat?

1191
01:23:50.591 --> 01:23:51.791
Oh, I see...

1192
01:23:56.392 --> 01:23:57.892
Why are you doing all that?

1193
01:23:57.893 --> 01:24:00.583
I'm trying to make His Excellency comfortable.

1194
01:24:00.584 --> 01:24:03.484
You do want your future father-in-law
to be comfortable, don't you?


1195
01:24:03.485 --> 01:24:04.685
My future...

1196
01:24:05.386 --> 01:24:07.386
Oh, yes, of course...

1197
01:24:09.887 --> 01:24:12.187
Oh, well, that isn't necessary!

1198
01:24:17.688 --> 01:24:19.988
What's that?
Araq.


1199
01:24:19.989 --> 01:24:22.389
Araq?
It's a wine made from rice.


1200
01:24:22.390 --> 01:24:23.690
Hmm... thank you.

1201
01:24:27.391 --> 01:24:28.791
Tastes like milk.

1202
01:24:32.792 --> 01:24:34.379
Sweet meat

1203
01:24:39.772 --> 01:24:42.992
Forgive me for leaving you, but duty calls.

1204
01:24:42.993 --> 01:24:46.093
Next time I'll leave them at home.

1205
01:24:48.994 --> 01:24:51.094
I will see you tomorrow at the wedding.

1206
01:24:59.795 --> 01:25:01.295
Congratulations.

1207
01:25:01.296 --> 01:25:05.196
Effie, I want to tell you how...
Skip it. Courtesy of the State Department.


1208
01:25:05.197 --> 01:25:08.317
We're going to have lots of oil.
That's why I'm celebrating.


1209
01:25:08.318 --> 01:25:11.718
Everybody's happy.
Don't you think you've had enough?


1210
01:25:11.979 --> 01:25:15.619
Of course not! It's just rice.
A little old rice never hurt anybody.


1211
01:25:15.620 --> 01:25:17.720
In China they live on rice.

1212
01:25:18.021 --> 01:25:21.821
Why don't you get some sleep?
What for? Complete waste of time.


1213
01:25:21.822 --> 01:25:25.522
Old Effie mustn't waste time.
Old Effie's a machine.


1214
01:25:25.523 --> 01:25:29.723
You didn't think I knew you thought
I was a machine, did you?


1215
01:25:29.724 --> 01:25:33.024
A little rice?
Uh, no, thank you.


1216
01:25:33.025 --> 01:25:35.979
Sure, click, click, push, pull, that's Effie.

1217
01:25:37.180 --> 01:25:41.180
You know, that isn't even my right name.
Do you want to know what my right name is?


1218
01:25:41.181 --> 01:25:46.281
Priscilla. Priscilla Effington.

1219
01:25:47.082 --> 01:25:49.782
I know.
Priscilla.


1220
01:25:49.979 --> 01:25:52.083
Isn't that a pretty name.

1221
01:25:52.284 --> 01:25:53.684
Say it.

1222
01:25:55.085 --> 01:25:56.785
Priscilla.

1223
01:25:58.086 --> 01:25:59.586
You want to know something?

1224
01:26:00.287 --> 01:26:02.387
Priscilla twisted the khan around her little finger.

1225
01:26:02.388 --> 01:26:03.888
Oh, hmm...

1226
01:26:03.889 --> 01:26:05.589
Oh, yes, thank you.

1227
01:26:05.590 --> 01:26:09.090
You want to know how?
It's a secret, but I'll tell you.


1228
01:26:09.091 --> 01:26:10.091
Shoot.

1229
01:26:10.092 --> 01:26:12.092
I can be a woman, too.

1230
01:26:12.593 --> 01:26:14.193
I know...
See?


1231
01:26:16.194 --> 01:26:21.194
Oh, no, a woman's work is never done.
Gotta wash him, dress him, feed him, and burp him.


1232
01:26:21.195 --> 01:26:23.595
Oh, now, stop it.
No, I'm just warming up.


1233
01:26:25.496 --> 01:26:30.196
Don't you think it's time to go to bed?
The night is filled with muted sounds.


1234
01:26:30.197 --> 01:26:35.197
The air is still, but in the hush
the whispers of a thousand lovers...


1235
01:26:38.298 --> 01:26:42.098
you and I together here
to dream a thousand wonders

1236
01:26:43.299 --> 01:26:46.599
the night is still, we kiss...

1237
01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:49.500
and in my heart a thousand thunders

1238
01:26:51.601 --> 01:26:53.601
Thanksgiving, three years ago.

1239
01:26:56.102 --> 01:26:59.102
That was the night that we met
at that silly State dinner.


1240
01:26:59.103 --> 01:27:04.503
It wasn't silly. Not until you got up to make a speech
and started reciting poetry.


1241
01:27:06.704 --> 01:27:09.804
I couldn't help it. I couldn't take my eyes off you.
You mean my hat.


1242
01:27:09.805 --> 01:27:11.905
I love your hats.

1243
01:27:11.906 --> 01:27:15.406
You were wearing a
sweet kind of airplane hat...

1244
01:27:15.407 --> 01:27:18.007
with gumdrops hanging down.

1245
01:27:21.008 --> 01:27:24.008
Oh, darling...
Oh, you better get some sleep.


1246
01:27:24.009 --> 01:27:27.509
You should be rested for your broukha tomorrow.

1247
01:27:27.510 --> 01:27:30.110
Priscilla...
And don't call me Priscilla.


1248
01:27:33.011 --> 01:27:34.311
Tarji!

1249
01:27:36.212 --> 01:27:37.912
Clem not love Tarji.

1250
01:27:37.913 --> 01:27:42.113
Clem love my friend, Effie.

1251
01:27:42.114 --> 01:27:45.414
Well, uh... Tarji, you mustn't blame her.

1252
01:27:45.415 --> 01:27:48.215
It's all over between Effie and me,
but uh...


1253
01:27:50.016 --> 01:27:52.916
Well, you see... once upon a time...

1254
01:27:52.917 --> 01:27:55.017
Bedtime story?

1255
01:27:56.018 --> 01:27:57.718
Yeah... yeah.

1256
01:27:58.219 --> 01:27:59.619
Bedtime story.

1257
01:28:00.220 --> 01:28:03.620
My friend Effie make you very happy.

1258
01:28:04.721 --> 01:28:09.121
You know, I didn't plan it this way, I just...
I not have to marry you now.


1259
01:28:09.522 --> 01:28:10.922
I free!

1260
01:28:12.123 --> 01:28:13.523
I beg your pardon?

1261
01:28:13.524 --> 01:28:18.124
Effie teach me. Woman not have to obey man
she does not love.


1262
01:28:20.425 --> 01:28:22.325
You're amazing, Tarji!

1263
01:28:23.326 --> 01:28:26.026
Well, all right. Now go and tell your father
right away.


1264
01:28:26.027 --> 01:28:28.827
Wait. I tell him I free woman.

1265
01:28:28.828 --> 01:28:33.528
I tell him I no love Clem.
You forget our wedding is in the morning.


1266
01:28:33.529 --> 01:28:37.029
You come to wedding tomorrow, I not arrive.

1267
01:28:37.030 --> 01:28:38.630
I jilt you.

1268
01:28:38.631 --> 01:28:43.231
You will? That's perfect.
I don't know how to thank you, Tarji.


1269
01:28:43.232 --> 01:28:46.232
I very happy. You be my friend.

1270
01:28:46.233 --> 01:28:48.233
Oh, indeed I will, always.

1271
01:28:49.534 --> 01:28:52.034
You're going to make
someone a very lucky man.

1272
01:28:52.935 --> 01:28:54.979
Then, uh, I'll see you at the wedding.

1273
01:28:54.980 --> 01:28:56.880
I mean, I won't
see you at the wedding.

1274
01:28:57.981 --> 01:28:59.781
Goodbye, dear, dear Tarji.

1275
01:29:00.980 --> 01:29:03.082
Or rather, badibani.

1276
01:29:03.083 --> 01:29:04.583
Badibani.

1277
01:29:04.584 --> 01:29:05.584
Right!

1278
01:29:10.585 --> 01:29:12.685
Father, welcome to America.

1279
01:29:15.386 --> 01:29:18.586
I must talk to you right away.
I have so much to tell...


1280
01:29:38.087 --> 01:29:40.287
Any minute now you're gonna be
the happiest man in the world.


1281
01:29:40.288 --> 01:29:41.788
You don't know how right you are.

1282
01:29:41.789 --> 01:29:43.989
What have you got to be so happy about?
You're getting married.


1283
01:29:43.990 --> 01:29:46.190
Sure you feel all right?
Never felt better in my life.


1284
01:29:46.191 --> 01:29:48.291
I wonder what's keeping Effie.
Effie?


1285
01:29:48.292 --> 01:29:51.292
I mean Tarji.
Oh, there's a girl in a million.


1286
01:29:51.293 --> 01:29:53.093
She's gonna make some man a wonderful wife.

1287
01:29:53.094 --> 01:29:54.480
I beg your pardon?

1288
01:29:54.595 --> 01:29:57.395
Oh, hello, Mac! Any terrible news?
Huh?


1289
01:29:57.596 --> 01:30:00.396
I mean, what's new?
Nothing. What's new with you?


1290
01:30:00.397 --> 01:30:01.498
Nothing.

1291
01:30:01.499 --> 01:30:03.699
That's interesting.
We must have another nice chat  sometime, huh?


1292
01:30:05.800 --> 01:30:07.300
You know, there's nothing like a wedding.

1293
01:30:07.301 --> 01:30:09.801
I wonder why bridegrooms are always supposed
to be so nervous.


1294
01:30:09.802 --> 01:30:11.702
What is there to be nervous about?
The ceremony...


1295
01:30:11.703 --> 01:30:14.203
Oh, Effie... Priscilla.

1296
01:30:14.204 --> 01:30:15.604
Effie.

1297
01:30:15.605 --> 01:30:17.405
I've got to see you. 
What are you doing tonight?

1298
01:30:22.906 --> 01:30:25.106
No wonder I'm the
happiest man in the world.

1299
01:30:25.107 --> 01:30:28.107
Clem, whatever it is you're taking,
don't take any more.


1300
01:30:28.108 --> 01:30:31.188
Oh, you should have seen Tarji last night.
She was magnificent.


1301
01:30:31.189 --> 01:30:32.989
There was fire in her eyes when she...

1302
01:30:34.190 --> 01:30:35.190
Tarji!

1303
01:30:35.191 --> 01:30:37.291
Who did you expect?
What is she doing here?


1304
01:30:37.292 --> 01:30:39.592
Maybe she came to get married.
No, no, she promised.


1305
01:30:40.393 --> 01:30:43.193
My son.
No, I'm not, sir. I mean...


1306
01:30:43.194 --> 01:30:46.794
The ceremony can start immediately.
I have long looked forward to this happy day.


1307
01:30:46.795 --> 01:30:50.395
Your Excellency will be pleased to know
that the Bukistanian ceremony will come first...


1308
01:30:50.396 --> 01:30:53.136
then the American ceremony,
and then we can sign the agreement.


1309
01:30:53.137 --> 01:30:55.737
We are pleased.
But, sir, didn't Tarji tell you?


1310
01:30:55.738 --> 01:30:57.238
Tell me what?

1311
01:31:02.739 --> 01:31:05.139
Here we go. I know
how anxious you must be.

1312
01:31:05.140 --> 01:31:06.640
No, Tarji!
Come on!


1313
01:31:06.641 --> 01:31:09.541
No, I tell you, I won't go through with this.
It never fails, they all go the same way.


1314
01:31:09.542 --> 01:31:11.542
I tell you, I love her!
That's why you're here!


1315
01:31:11.543 --> 01:31:12.943
Come on, everybody's watching.

1316
01:31:19.044 --> 01:31:21.344
Double crosser! Coward!

1317
01:31:23.745 --> 01:31:25.245
I thought you were a free woman.

1318
01:31:25.546 --> 01:31:27.979
What about Amelia Bloomer?

1319
01:31:27.980 --> 01:31:29.680
Doesn't she mean anything to you?

1320
01:31:31.681 --> 01:31:34.181
Well, what can you expect from a woman?

1321
01:31:34.182 --> 01:31:36.782
You're weak, helpless and nothing but trouble.

1322
01:31:36.783 --> 01:31:38.483
And that goes for all of you.

1323
01:31:40.284 --> 01:31:41.884
Harriet Beecher Stowe.

1324
01:31:41.885 --> 01:31:44.085
She wrote about slaves didn't she?

1325
01:31:44.086 --> 01:31:46.086
Well, it sure take one to know one.

1326
01:31:46.087 --> 01:31:49.387
She great woman. 
She write Uncle Tom's Cabin.

1327
01:31:49.388 --> 01:31:53.588
Susan B. Anthony.
Susan B, Anthony fight for women's vote.


1328
01:31:53.589 --> 01:31:56.789
And that not all. Carrie Country.
Carrie Nation!


1329
01:31:56.790 --> 01:31:58.390
Carrie Nation.
Silence!


1330
01:31:58.391 --> 01:32:00.691
I will not silence! I free woman!

1331
01:32:00.692 --> 01:32:02.192
I not love Clem.

1332
01:32:04.293 --> 01:32:07.693
She jilted me! She jilted me!
Do not worry, my son, she will marry you.


1333
01:32:07.694 --> 01:32:11.834
I'm not worth bothering about, I...
What have you done now, what's wrong?


1334
01:32:11.835 --> 01:32:15.135
Nothing's wrong. The wedding's off.
You do not wish to marry my daughter?


1335
01:32:15.136 --> 01:32:18.636
Of course he does.
It's just a little nervous breakdown, Your Excellency.


1336
01:32:18.637 --> 01:32:22.237
You keep out of this.
In Bukistan we do not use our women for political tricks.


1337
01:32:22.238 --> 01:32:25.138
Come.
What about the oil agreement?


1338
01:32:25.139 --> 01:32:28.739
It will be as you say.
It will be signed after the wedding.


1339
01:32:28.740 --> 01:32:30.840
And there will be no wedding.

1340
01:32:31.641 --> 01:32:33.979
Well spoken, Your Excellency.

1341
01:32:33.980 --> 01:32:36.680
You are wise not to
be deceived by this man.

1342
01:32:36.681 --> 01:32:39.581
And you should be proud that your daughter
has inherited your wisdom.


1343
01:32:39.582 --> 01:32:42.882
You are using psychology.
No, Your Excellency, truth.


1344
01:32:42.883 --> 01:32:48.713
The daughter of the Khan is not merchandise to be sent
on approval to a man with the judgment of a camel.


1345
01:32:48.714 --> 01:32:50.114
That is truth.

1346
01:32:50.115 --> 01:32:51.815
Oh, absolutely.

1347
01:32:51.816 --> 01:32:56.216
I know how easy it is to be deceived by this man.
I myself was engaged to him.


1348
01:32:56.217 --> 01:32:58.217
You?
I admit it. With shame.


1349
01:32:58.218 --> 01:33:00.818
He would have made the princess as unhappy
as he made me.


1350
01:33:00.819 --> 01:33:02.819
He was unsatisfactory.

1351
01:33:02.820 --> 01:33:06.920
Completely. He was conceited, and selfish and unbearable.

1352
01:33:06.921 --> 01:33:10.021
Surely the Khan will not allow a man like this
to stand in the way...


1353
01:33:10.022 --> 01:33:12.822
of signing an oil agreement
that will benefit your country.

1354
01:33:12.823 --> 01:33:17.323
That is true. You are a remarkable woman,
Miss Effington.


1355
01:33:17.324 --> 01:33:20.524
He will not stand in the way.

1356
01:33:20.525 --> 01:33:23.225
I knew you would understand.
I do.


1357
01:33:23.979 --> 01:33:26.226
You must love him very much.

1358
01:33:36.027 --> 01:33:38.427
What was that again?
Clem, I've got so much to tell you.


1359
01:33:38.428 --> 01:33:40.128
You mean you've forgotten something?

1360
01:33:40.129 --> 01:33:42.929
I'm a selfish monster, 
I'm foolish, arrogant...

1361
01:33:42.030 --> 01:33:45.130
In other words, you're just an average man.

1362
01:33:45.131 --> 01:33:47.831
Oh, Clem, make an earthquake for me.

1363
01:33:47.832 --> 01:33:50.732
It's just an expression she uses.

1364
01:33:53.033 --> 01:33:55.233
Don't talk like that. 
They'll get the wrong idea.

1365
01:33:55.234 --> 01:33:57.434
Come here. I owe you a bloukha.

1366
01:34:09.035 --> 01:34:15.035
