<i>Come on down and see if you can
knock Big Black off his block.</i>


11
00:01:08.945 --> 00:01:10.697
Come on.
I wrote this one just for you.


12
00:01:10.864 --> 00:01:12.992
I don't know why I let you
talk me into coming.


13
00:01:13.158 --> 00:01:15.160
I think I'm the oldest sardine
in this can.


14
00:01:15.327 --> 00:01:17.705
- Well, you don't look it.
- Well, that's true.


15
00:01:17.871 --> 00:01:19.794
But it's your song.
You go up and sing it.


16
00:01:19.956 --> 00:01:22.550
- You're the singer in our family.
- Honey, you sing.


17
00:01:23.293 --> 00:01:26.092
Yeah, but you know
how to hold people's attention.


18
00:01:27.088 --> 00:01:28.715
People love to just hear you talk.

19
00:01:28.882 --> 00:01:31.681
Imagine how you're gonna knock it out
when you get up there.


20
00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.832
All right, now.

21
00:02:00.038 --> 00:02:03.292
Fellas. Fellas.

22
00:02:03.458 --> 00:02:04.505
Nice.

23
00:02:04.668 --> 00:02:06.136
Keep that applause going.

24
00:02:06.294 --> 00:02:08.547
Give it up one more time for Black.

25
00:02:08.713 --> 00:02:11.432
If you guys are having a good time,
say "oh, yeah."


26
00:02:11.591 --> 00:02:12.638
Oh, yeah!

27
00:02:12.801 --> 00:02:14.895
Please.
I went over everything with the band.


28
00:02:16.555 --> 00:02:20.526
Please. I just want
to hear my song. Please.


29
00:02:21.184 --> 00:02:23.687
Are you sure you want to do this?

30
00:02:23.854 --> 00:02:26.949
- You, are you sure?
- That man is Black!


31
00:02:27.107 --> 00:02:28.233
You hear that?

32
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.903
That's the sound of success, baby.

33
00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:32.491
What you doing?

34
00:02:32.654 --> 00:02:34.201
Wait a minute.

35
00:02:34.364 --> 00:02:35.411
Let's get a room.

36
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.918
Wait a minute. 
Bro, you see her?

37
00:02:39.077 --> 00:02:41.580
Good God, woman.
What's wrong with you?


38
00:02:41.746 --> 00:02:44.499
Coming up to the stage right now
is a beautiful young lady.


39
00:02:44.666 --> 00:02:47.089
She's just as fine
as she wants to be.

40
00:02:47.252 --> 00:02:49.425
Now, this lady is a Detroit native...

41
00:02:49.588 --> 00:02:52.091
...and she's never been
to the Discovery Club...


42
00:02:52.257 --> 00:02:55.602
...so I want everybody
to show her some extra love.


43
00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.105
Strutting up on-stage right now...

44
00:02:59.264 --> 00:03:03.644
...is Sister Anderson!

45
00:03:07.606 --> 00:03:08.653
Thank you.

46
00:03:42.641 --> 00:03:44.393
So, what's up, Mr. Manager?

47
00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:46.687
We gonna do some business or what?

48
00:03:46.853 --> 00:03:48.730
Black, you got to lose
some weight, baby.


49
00:03:48.897 --> 00:03:51.525
Man, you must be crazy.
Man, all the ladies love me.


50
00:03:51.691 --> 00:03:55.446
And besides, this old belly
is what helps me sing.


51
00:03:56.404 --> 00:03:58.122
TV's getting bigger-

52
00:03:58.281 --> 00:04:00.033
- Clothes getting smaller.
- Yeah.


53
00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.830
- You know, you'd be good on radio.
- Man, that's cold, man. That's cold.


54
00:04:14.422 --> 00:04:16.470
Lord have mercy!

55
00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:09.812
All right.

56
00:05:09.978 --> 00:05:12.197
I see you looking. 
Sure, you're right.

57
00:05:12.355 --> 00:05:15.199
You were so great.
But we have to hurry.


58
00:05:15.358 --> 00:05:17.156
We have five minutes
to catch the bus.


59
00:05:17.318 --> 00:05:20.071
Give it up one more time
for Sister Anderson.


60
00:05:20.238 --> 00:05:21.615
My goodness gracious.

61
00:05:21.781 --> 00:05:23.749
Excuse me. Excuse me.

62
00:05:23.908 --> 00:05:25.330
It's Sister, right?

63
00:05:25.493 --> 00:05:29.043
You gotta forgive me for earlier.
I was all wrong about you.


64
00:05:29.205 --> 00:05:32.334
You were foxy up there.
Promise me you'll come back next week.


65
00:05:33.001 --> 00:05:35.254
Maybe. Maybe not.

66
00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:38.139
- But, baby, I gotta...
- Excuse me. Excuse me.


67
00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:40.683
I really don't date younger men.

68
00:05:40.842 --> 00:05:44.267
- No, no, please, you were so--
- I'm sorry, but we have to go.


69
00:05:44.429 --> 00:05:46.773
Where can I find you?

70
00:05:53.146 --> 00:05:55.274
Next time it's your turn.

71
00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:57.283
Hi.

72
00:05:59.736 --> 00:06:02.034
Hi. Thank you.

73
00:06:03.073 --> 00:06:05.451
You were so good.

74
00:06:13.083 --> 00:06:14.710
That was so fun!

75
00:06:14.876 --> 00:06:16.674
Yeah, it was.

76
00:06:16.836 --> 00:06:20.136
Next time, can you get through
the chorus before you do your solo?


77
00:06:20.298 --> 00:06:21.595
Miss Thing, next time?

78
00:06:21.758 --> 00:06:23.852
Yeah. I have a lot more songs.

79
00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:27.435
Then you better get a lot more confident
and learn to sing them yourself.


80
00:06:27.597 --> 00:06:28.894
Slavery is over.

81
00:06:29.057 --> 00:06:30.934
Really? You're not gonna
sing anymore?


82
00:06:31.101 --> 00:06:32.899
No.

83
00:06:34.687 --> 00:06:36.906
Assume the position. What?

84
00:07:06.052 --> 00:07:09.977
Y'all are late, and she's up.

85
00:07:22.527 --> 00:07:24.700
- Sparkle. Hush.
- Sorry.


86
00:07:32.704 --> 00:07:34.832
Hurry.

87
00:07:37.333 --> 00:07:39.586
What y'all doing in there?

88
00:07:50.889 --> 00:07:52.857
My babies.

89
00:07:53.266 --> 00:07:55.564
But I know y'all don't
love each other that much.


90
00:07:56.561 --> 00:07:58.734
Sister and Sparkle, curl your hair.

91
00:07:58.897 --> 00:08:00.899
Church in the morning.

92
00:08:01.065 --> 00:08:02.112
You hear me?

93
00:08:02.984 --> 00:08:06.454
Dolores, why is my window open?
I'm not trying to heat the outside.


94
00:08:08.573 --> 00:08:09.790
Close it.

95
00:08:09.949 --> 00:08:11.496
- Good night.
- Good night.


96
00:08:14.329 --> 00:08:15.922
Is she gone?

97
00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:20.085
Y'all heifers sneak out,
and I get fussed at?


98
00:08:20.752 --> 00:08:22.754
Laugh at-- Laugh at that.
Is that funny?


99
00:08:23.129 --> 00:08:24.426
Peace be with you.

100
00:08:24.589 --> 00:08:27.342
And also with you.

101
00:08:30.261 --> 00:08:33.231
- Good morning.
- Good morning.


102
00:08:33.389 --> 00:08:39.237
You know, the Lord loves a church
full of happy, good-looking black folk.


103
00:08:39.395 --> 00:08:40.772
Amen!

104
00:08:40.939 --> 00:08:42.782
I know y'all happy
this morning, right?


105
00:08:42.941 --> 00:08:44.033
Yes!

106
00:08:44.192 --> 00:08:48.117
Ain't no frowns in this
church today, is there?


107
00:08:48.863 --> 00:08:51.912
No frowns, no clowns,
not in church.


108
00:08:52.075 --> 00:08:53.668
And look at the choir.

109
00:08:53.826 --> 00:08:56.124
- How y'all doing this morning?
- Good!


110
00:08:56.287 --> 00:08:58.585
- Levi, there she go.
- What? What?


111
00:08:58.748 --> 00:09:01.922
Seven Sundays, seven churches,
and $7 later, and I find her.


112
00:09:02.085 --> 00:09:03.678
- That light-skinned girl?
- There.


113
00:09:03.836 --> 00:09:05.884
Oh, man.
Well, that's Tammy Anderson.


114
00:09:06.047 --> 00:09:08.596
Yeah, man, she is smoking hot.

115
00:09:08.758 --> 00:09:10.385
- Tammy.
- Two sisters. They all fine.


116
00:09:10.551 --> 00:09:12.303
- They can all sing too.
- Is that right?


117
00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:15.189
Sure, you're right.
But they mama crazy, though.


118
00:09:17.392 --> 00:09:19.986
Y'all know better.

119
00:09:20.144 --> 00:09:23.944
I know I can't sing,
but I can love to hear singing.


120
00:09:24.107 --> 00:09:25.359
'Yes!
'Right?


121
00:09:28.403 --> 00:09:31.828
I'll see you next week, right?
Okay. See you later.


122
00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:37.166
Excuse me. You was at the Discovery
a few weeks ago.


123
00:09:43.584 --> 00:09:47.088
- Bible study's at your house this week?
- Yeah, it is.


124
00:09:47.255 --> 00:09:48.632
You know, you bad at this.

125
00:09:50.341 --> 00:09:52.184
Just act natural.

126
00:09:53.052 --> 00:09:54.349
Hi. My name's Stix.

127
00:09:54.512 --> 00:09:55.809
Sparkle.

128
00:09:56.431 --> 00:09:57.774
Sara.

129
00:09:57.932 --> 00:10:01.357
- Who is my baby talking to?
- Nineteen ain't no baby no more, Emma.


130
00:10:02.562 --> 00:10:05.441
What? No need in eyeballing me.
I tells the truth.


131
00:10:05.606 --> 00:10:07.233
It's in my contract as your friend.

132
00:10:07.775 --> 00:10:10.198
I'm telling you,
you hold on too tight to that one...


133
00:10:10.361 --> 00:10:13.205
...she'll be unmarried
and back on your doorstep like Sister.


134
00:10:14.532 --> 00:10:16.330
That's just temporary, okay?

135
00:10:16.492 --> 00:10:19.416
Well, New York just spit her
right on back out, huh?


136
00:10:19.579 --> 00:10:20.705
- No.
- You know what?


137
00:10:20.872 --> 00:10:23.546
You worry about your daughter,
I'll worry about mine.


138
00:10:23.708 --> 00:10:25.381
- I'm just saying.
- Yeah, what?


139
00:10:25.543 --> 00:10:26.920
- Mom, I need some money.
- What?


140
00:10:27.086 --> 00:10:29.885
They selling dinners in the basement,
and they going fast.


141
00:10:30.048 --> 00:10:31.095
- Mom?
- Don't do it.


142
00:10:31.257 --> 00:10:32.884
- Mama, please.
- Come with me.


143
00:10:33.051 --> 00:10:35.179
- Now you stop.
- See y'all later.


144
00:10:42.226 --> 00:10:44.228
Sparkle.

145
00:10:44.395 --> 00:10:45.942
Let's go.

146
00:10:46.773 --> 00:10:50.744
So I will see you
at Bible study, Sparkle?


147
00:10:51.944 --> 00:10:53.537
Maybe.

148
00:11:03.998 --> 00:11:07.093
<i>Another one of my white friends
came to me the other day and said:</i>


149
00:11:07.251 --> 00:11:09.925
<i>"Where's the best place
to hide something from a Negro...</i>


150
00:11:10.088 --> 00:11:11.465
<i>...and he'll never find it?"</i>

151
00:11:11.631 --> 00:11:13.850
<i>I told him, "A work boot. "</i>

152
00:11:16.594 --> 00:11:18.392
Y'all know he talking about us, right?

153
00:11:18.554 --> 00:11:20.022
<i>People are always asking me...</i>

154
00:11:20.765 --> 00:11:22.358
- Where is she?
- I don't know.


155
00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:26.480
- Ms. Anderson, where's the bathroom?
- Down the hall, second door to the right.


156
00:11:26.646 --> 00:11:27.772
Second door.

157
00:11:27.939 --> 00:11:29.441
- Thank you.
- Yeah, second door.


158
00:11:30.066 --> 00:11:33.946
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, Satin Struthers.
Let's give him a hand.</i>


159
00:11:34.112 --> 00:11:37.207
<i>Great job. Thanks for coming.
Isn't he funny?</i>


160
00:11:39.909 --> 00:11:40.956
There you are.

161
00:11:41.619 --> 00:11:43.667
Why you not in Bible study?

162
00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:45.332
Haven't you heard?

163
00:11:45.498 --> 00:11:48.718
I'm a heathen. Don't want to sit in there
and be a hypocrite.


164
00:11:48.876 --> 00:11:50.844
Well, we already
got something in common...


165
00:11:51.003 --> 00:11:54.598
...because I only came
just so I could ask you out.


166
00:11:56.551 --> 00:11:59.304
The other door. To the right.

167
00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:01.939
Other door. Sorry.

168
00:12:10.857 --> 00:12:13.326
Oh, y'all like that, huh?

169
00:12:13.484 --> 00:12:16.533
Funky dance, huh? You like that.
You like that music? Funky, huh?


170
00:12:17.321 --> 00:12:19.164
It make you want to dance.
Come on.


171
00:12:19.323 --> 00:12:20.449
Get it, Mama.

172
00:12:20.616 --> 00:12:21.708
Yeah, Mama gonna get it.

173
00:12:21.868 --> 00:12:23.085
Mama gonna get it.

174
00:12:23.244 --> 00:12:24.837
And you will too.

175
00:12:24.996 --> 00:12:28.125
You keep dancing like that,
you'll bring home a baby you can't feed.


176
00:12:29.333 --> 00:12:30.380
Let's open our Bibles.

177
00:12:32.837 --> 00:12:36.307
The deal was color television
for an hour of Bible study.


178
00:12:37.008 --> 00:12:39.852
I lived up to my end,
now you live up to yours.


179
00:12:40.845 --> 00:12:42.939
So let's go to Psalms 10--

180
00:12:43.097 --> 00:12:46.522
Reverend Bryce called.
Says he need you to check the books.


181
00:12:46.684 --> 00:12:49.858
The numbers are not adding up.

182
00:12:52.523 --> 00:12:54.150
All right.

183
00:12:58.029 --> 00:12:59.451
What are you watching?

184
00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:05.079
Oh, I love this song.

185
00:13:12.001 --> 00:13:14.971
No, no. Too many hormones
unattended in here.


186
00:13:15.129 --> 00:13:17.973
Let's go. Get out. Come on.
Sister, turn that TV off.


187
00:13:18.132 --> 00:13:20.430
Thank you. Come on, let's go.

188
00:13:20.593 --> 00:13:22.061
- Bye, Sparkle.
- See you.


189
00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:25.269
- Good night, Mama.
- Good night, baby.


190
00:13:25.431 --> 00:13:27.308
It was just getting good.

191
00:13:27.475 --> 00:13:28.818
See you tonight, Sparkle.

192
00:13:28.976 --> 00:13:31.525
- Call you later.
- All right.


193
00:13:31.687 --> 00:13:33.030
See you next time.

194
00:13:33.189 --> 00:13:35.658
- Bye, Tammy.
- Bye, Tune.


195
00:13:38.402 --> 00:13:40.780
Well, good night.

196
00:13:40.947 --> 00:13:42.620
Good night.

197
00:13:47.954 --> 00:13:51.959
Why are all the cute ones
always so stupid?


198
00:13:52.708 --> 00:13:55.336
Hey, can I talk
to you for a second?

199
00:14:03.844 --> 00:14:06.222
All right, I'm going.

200
00:15:22.465 --> 00:15:23.808
Please, don't stop.

201
00:15:23.966 --> 00:15:26.389
- What are you still doing here?
- That was beautiful.


202
00:15:29.513 --> 00:15:31.356
Wait, that's your song?
You wrote that?


203
00:15:31.515 --> 00:15:33.188
Only if you thought it was good.

204
00:15:33.351 --> 00:15:34.694
I thought it was phenomenal.

205
00:15:34.852 --> 00:15:37.105
Then I wrote it.

206
00:15:37.271 --> 00:15:39.774
So did you write that song
your sister sang...


207
00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:42.409
...at the Discovery a few weeks back?

208
00:15:43.402 --> 00:15:46.622
- Yes, but she kind of made it her own.
- Wait a minute.


209
00:15:46.781 --> 00:15:48.533
You wrote that song?

210
00:15:48.699 --> 00:15:50.747
You wrote the song you were singing?

211
00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:54.164
You wrote the songs in here too?

212
00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:56.378
Yes.

213
00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:58.383
What you gonna do with the music?

214
00:15:58.542 --> 00:16:00.544
- Nothing.
- Why not?


215
00:16:01.337 --> 00:16:04.056
Because my mother
would never let me.


216
00:16:04.215 --> 00:16:07.765
Plus, I'm not the singer in the family.
Sister is, then Dee.


217
00:16:07.927 --> 00:16:10.476
I sing in the choir
so I don't sit by myself in church.


218
00:16:10.638 --> 00:16:12.982
No offense,
but I'm just hearing excuses.


219
00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:14.813
- Excuse me?
- I don't mean to be rude.


220
00:16:14.975 --> 00:16:17.979
I'm just passionate,
especially when it comes down to music.


221
00:16:18.145 --> 00:16:20.898
That's why I'm here.
I'm staying with my cousin, Levi.


222
00:16:21.065 --> 00:16:24.365
I'm from Kansas City.
We got a cool jazz scene down there.


223
00:16:24.527 --> 00:16:27.952
I managed a few acts,
but the money's here in Motown.


224
00:16:28.114 --> 00:16:30.208
And I want to be--
I am the next Berry Gordy.


225
00:16:30.366 --> 00:16:32.915
I figure, his stomach ain't
growling like mine anymore.


226
00:16:33.077 --> 00:16:36.456
Maybe he's leaving a lot
of steak and potatoes out there.


227
00:16:38.082 --> 00:16:40.005
You mind if I hear that song again?

228
00:16:42.837 --> 00:16:45.010
Still needs a lot of work.

229
00:17:00.271 --> 00:17:01.693
Why won't you unpack?

230
00:17:01.856 --> 00:17:03.858
I really don't plan on
being here that long.


231
00:17:04.525 --> 00:17:06.118
You said that two months ago.

232
00:17:09.864 --> 00:17:11.616
Sorry

233
00:17:12.742 --> 00:17:17.168
Hey, don't ever be sorry
for telling the truth, Spark.


234
00:17:18.289 --> 00:17:20.041
What was that?

235
00:17:25.713 --> 00:17:27.511
Your Romeo is out there.

236
00:17:27.673 --> 00:17:29.550
What?

237
00:17:44.315 --> 00:17:46.659
You can't be throwing rocks
at my window.


238
00:17:46.817 --> 00:17:47.989
My mother has a gun.

239
00:17:49.862 --> 00:17:51.830
A gun. A big one.

240
00:17:51.989 --> 00:17:53.991
There's an underground club tonight.

241
00:17:54.158 --> 00:17:56.252
The kind that songwriters
don't want to miss.


242
00:17:56.410 --> 00:17:57.957
You got to hear the music.

243
00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:00.498
It's the stuff they ain't playing
on the radio.


244
00:18:00.664 --> 00:18:04.214
- Come with me.
- He wants me to go hear music with him.


245
00:18:05.211 --> 00:18:08.681
You've snuck out
of the house for less.


246
00:18:08.839 --> 00:18:10.967
And I know just the dress.

247
00:18:13.010 --> 00:18:14.432
You coming?

248
00:18:58.138 --> 00:19:00.061
I ain't gonna bite you.

249
00:19:00.224 --> 00:19:02.352
And how do I know that?

250
00:19:03.477 --> 00:19:05.821
You're gonna have to trust me.

251
00:19:40.347 --> 00:19:41.815
Can I tell you something?

252
00:19:41.974 --> 00:19:44.648
I think your lyrics are too safe.

253
00:19:44.810 --> 00:19:47.780
I mean, you got Dr. 
King, the war.

254
00:19:49.315 --> 00:19:53.195
I don't think the metaphorical lyrics
gonna fly anymore.


255
00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:55.033
What?
You impressed by my big word?


256
00:19:55.195 --> 00:19:57.368
I was.

257
00:19:58.908 --> 00:20:01.752
In the spirit of telling the truth,
can I tell you another?


258
00:20:01.911 --> 00:20:04.915
- I wouldn't want you to lie.
- Then why do you lie to yourself?


259
00:20:06.498 --> 00:20:09.001
About not wanting to sing?

260
00:20:09.543 --> 00:20:11.466
I mean, Sparkle,
you writing these songs.


261
00:20:11.629 --> 00:20:13.552
And you can sing.

262
00:20:14.506 --> 00:20:18.511
- So why aren't you singing them?
- I'm no Diana or Aretha.


263
00:20:20.304 --> 00:20:21.897
You know, you right.

264
00:20:22.056 --> 00:20:24.058
You Sparkle.

265
00:20:25.476 --> 00:20:29.401
Look, my mom
used to sing professionally.


266
00:20:30.689 --> 00:20:32.908
She tried to break out
and it almost killed her.


267
00:20:33.067 --> 00:20:36.241
So thank you, but I know
the realities of this business.


268
00:20:36.403 --> 00:20:39.077
- I'm just doing it for fun.
- You know the realities?


269
00:20:39.239 --> 00:20:41.333
- Oh, stop.
- I'm...


270
00:20:42.076 --> 00:20:43.498
Listen.

271
00:20:43.661 --> 00:20:45.959
What are you afraid of?

272
00:20:46.121 --> 00:20:47.498
Your mom or your own voice?

273
00:20:48.999 --> 00:20:51.548
Maybe you'd be like your mom
and never reach your goals.


274
00:20:52.419 --> 00:20:55.548
But don't fall short of it
because you can't admit that you want it.


275
00:20:57.257 --> 00:20:58.804
Okay.

276
00:21:00.511 --> 00:21:03.264
I want to be better than Diana.

277
00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:05.812
I want to be a star.

278
00:21:16.026 --> 00:21:17.903
Thank you.

279
00:21:20.114 --> 00:21:21.866
I had a great time tonight.

280
00:21:22.032 --> 00:21:24.455
And just in case
I never get out of that house...


281
00:21:24.618 --> 00:21:26.586
...thank you for making me
tell the truth.


282
00:21:42.636 --> 00:21:43.683
Sparkle...

283
00:21:45.723 --> 00:21:47.396
...do you want to be a star?

284
00:21:48.017 --> 00:21:49.769
What?

285
00:21:49.935 --> 00:21:53.235
- Do you want to be a star?
- Yes, I want to be a star.


286
00:21:53.397 --> 00:21:55.695
No, I don't believe you.
Say it like you mean it.


287
00:21:55.858 --> 00:21:57.826
Yes, I want to be a star.

288
00:21:57.985 --> 00:21:59.737
Okay.

289
00:21:59.903 --> 00:22:02.577
First you have to
write a song for your sister...


290
00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:04.742
...something where she
can work the crowd.


291
00:22:04.908 --> 00:22:07.582
Sparkle, you gonna have to get
over your fear of singing...


292
00:22:07.745 --> 00:22:09.622
...because you and Dee
gonna back her up.


293
00:22:09.788 --> 00:22:11.916
I mean, everybody loves
a good girl group.


294
00:22:12.082 --> 00:22:15.256
Now, you tweak your lyrics,
make them more raw, more relatable.


295
00:22:15.419 --> 00:22:17.012
But Fillmore, here we come.

296
00:22:17.171 --> 00:22:19.299
Of course, you gonna
have to win Cliff Bells.


297
00:22:19.465 --> 00:22:23.015
- You have to be invited to compete.
- Yeah, I know. I'm gonna work on that.


298
00:22:23.177 --> 00:22:26.681
Now, I want you to work on your sisters,
and I'll work on Cliff Bells.


299
00:22:26.847 --> 00:22:29.521
- And you'll be our manager?
- Of course.


300
00:22:29.683 --> 00:22:31.936
Then you manage to get my sisters.

301
00:22:33.937 --> 00:22:35.234
Do I have you?

302
00:22:35.397 --> 00:22:37.070
Backup, remember?

303
00:22:38.233 --> 00:22:40.156
Good night.

304
00:22:43.405 --> 00:22:45.828
Cliff Bells?
Come on. I'm not embarrassing myself.


305
00:22:45.991 --> 00:22:49.086
- Didn't Marvin Gaye get booed there?
- Yeah, but it made him better.


306
00:22:49.244 --> 00:22:51.121
Now he's traveling, making millions.

307
00:22:51.288 --> 00:22:53.165
Mr. Gordy is making millions.

308
00:22:53.332 --> 00:22:57.178
However it may be, it was enough
to get him out of his mama's house.


309
00:22:58.045 --> 00:23:00.218
You don't have to be rude about it.

310
00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:03.008
Well, I don't really know
if you were asking me.


311
00:23:03.175 --> 00:23:06.850
You never really looked my way,
so our eyes never got to dance, but I'm in.


312
00:23:07.012 --> 00:23:09.185
And just to be clear,
I'm in it for the money.


313
00:23:09.348 --> 00:23:12.943
Medical school is expensive, so, no,
you won't get 20 percent. Fifteen max.


314
00:23:13.102 --> 00:23:16.572
And once I get accepted into medical
school you will have to replace me.


315
00:23:16.730 --> 00:23:19.449
And if you pretend
like I don't exist going forward...


316
00:23:19.608 --> 00:23:22.202
...I will turn my sisters against you.

317
00:23:22.361 --> 00:23:26.457
Other than that, sounds like fun.

318
00:23:30.536 --> 00:23:32.834
I'll wait for you guys outside.

319
00:23:35.290 --> 00:23:38.840
I'll let you know.
My first day at Freeman's is tomorrow.


320
00:23:39.002 --> 00:23:41.380
Working at a department store?

321
00:23:42.756 --> 00:23:45.760
You ain't gonna make no money.
Sparkle!


322
00:23:47.511 --> 00:23:48.558
Come on, Sparkle.

323
00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:52.395
- Everything I said the other night, I believe.
- You used me to get to Sister.


324
00:23:54.309 --> 00:23:56.903
You said it yourself,
Sister is the better performer.


325
00:23:57.479 --> 00:23:59.527
Sparkle.

326
00:24:04.319 --> 00:24:07.243
<i>Have you lost faith
in Mr. Johnson?</i>


327
00:24:07.406 --> 00:24:10.330
<i>Well, I guess the president
would have to answer that question.</i>


328
00:24:10.492 --> 00:24:13.041
Oh, who doesn't like Sidney Poitier?

329
00:24:13.203 --> 00:24:16.173
- But the movie, you liked the movie?
- Yeah, I loved the movie.


330
00:24:16.331 --> 00:24:20.552
More importantly, the next time
you take me out, you need to have a car.


331
00:24:20.711 --> 00:24:21.758
Oh, I'm just--

332
00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:24.548
I'm just waiting
on the right one to buy, baby.


333
00:24:24.715 --> 00:24:28.720
Take me on a date on a bus
in the rain?


334
00:24:30.053 --> 00:24:31.555
You're lucky I like you.

335
00:24:35.976 --> 00:24:40.106
Look, I don't know any other way to be
than myself. I'm a straight shooter.


336
00:24:40.272 --> 00:24:43.242
So here we go.

337
00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:44.447
I like you too.

338
00:24:46.236 --> 00:24:47.783
I do, and I
want to be your man.

339
00:24:49.406 --> 00:24:53.331
I'm serious. I ain't like all the other
jive guys that just want to do you.


340
00:24:53.493 --> 00:24:55.746
I heard about your reputation.

341
00:24:55.913 --> 00:24:57.506
I just think it's what guys say...

342
00:24:57.664 --> 00:25:00.759
...when they see something beautiful
and know they can't have it.


343
00:25:02.419 --> 00:25:05.764
So they'd rather tear it down
than make it something they want.


344
00:25:07.758 --> 00:25:10.011
But I see your beauty.

345
00:25:11.470 --> 00:25:13.143
Outside and inside.

346
00:25:13.847 --> 00:25:15.645
I want to earn it.

347
00:25:15.807 --> 00:25:17.855
Kind of like a job.

348
00:25:18.644 --> 00:25:22.615
Yeah, so just tell me what you need
to fall in love with me.


349
00:25:22.773 --> 00:25:25.026
Because whatever it is, 
I'll do it, girl.

350
00:25:25.192 --> 00:25:30.073
Whether you believe it or not,
I'm already in love with you.


351
00:25:33.867 --> 00:25:37.497
I already heard it so much,
it all sounds like BS to me.


352
00:25:37.663 --> 00:25:40.462
Maybe I better roll up
my sleeves then, huh?


353
00:25:40.624 --> 00:25:44.003
- Hopefully not as high as your pants.
- What's wrong with my pants, girl?


354
00:25:44.169 --> 00:25:46.797
- This is the style. You can see my socks.
- Change it.


355
00:25:46.964 --> 00:25:48.637
Put some sugar in them shoes.

356
00:25:48.799 --> 00:25:52.269
So I can sweet-talk
my pants down, huh?


357
00:25:58.558 --> 00:26:00.435
What's this?

358
00:26:02.688 --> 00:26:04.907
Open it up.

359
00:26:08.527 --> 00:26:10.074
Oh, Levi.

360
00:26:10.237 --> 00:26:13.161
I swear,
one day that's gonna be yours.


361
00:26:13.323 --> 00:26:14.370
I promise you.

362
00:26:19.371 --> 00:26:20.748
That's Satin Struthers.

363
00:26:20.914 --> 00:26:24.760
Now that's some of the coolest trolling
I done seen in a long time.


364
00:26:26.211 --> 00:26:28.464
- Did you see this cat, Ham?
- Yeah, I see him.


365
00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:30.678
What's your name, brother?

366
00:26:30.841 --> 00:26:32.388
Levison, but they call me Levi.

367
00:26:33.010 --> 00:26:36.685
Levi, here I am buying the real deal
for these women...


368
00:26:36.847 --> 00:26:39.691
...and you tell me
you cut a picture out of a magazine...


369
00:26:39.850 --> 00:26:41.818
...and just put it in a box?

370
00:26:41.977 --> 00:26:43.820
I'm about to go get me
some scissors...


371
00:26:43.979 --> 00:26:47.779
...and cut some pictures out of magazines
like your boy Levi right here.


372
00:26:49.526 --> 00:26:52.120
Clip-clip, hussies.
Clip-clip, hussies.


373
00:26:55.157 --> 00:26:57.876
Can I see it? Let me see that.

374
00:26:58.869 --> 00:27:02.089
This is nice.

375
00:27:05.125 --> 00:27:06.877
You got a good man here.

376
00:27:07.627 --> 00:27:08.719
Yep.

377
00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:14.139
Yeah, I used to eat in here
back in the day...


378
00:27:14.926 --> 00:27:16.803
...when I was struggling.

379
00:27:16.970 --> 00:27:19.348
This is some real cheap,
good food.


380
00:27:19.514 --> 00:27:23.394
But I'm not gonna hold you guys.

381
00:27:24.853 --> 00:27:26.355
Have a good night.

382
00:27:29.399 --> 00:27:30.446
Levi.

383
00:27:30.609 --> 00:27:32.657
Satin.

384
00:27:34.571 --> 00:27:36.573
- Did you see her?
- You were so wrong.


385
00:27:38.075 --> 00:27:41.170
Tammy, I should get you home.

386
00:27:41.328 --> 00:27:42.955
Sure.

387
00:28:08.230 --> 00:28:10.324
Mama was so pretty.

388
00:28:10.482 --> 00:28:11.984
Oh, here's Dee's daddy.

389
00:28:12.150 --> 00:28:15.154
Here's a good one of
yours and Sister's daddy.


390
00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:17.448
Cute, but no good.

391
00:28:17.614 --> 00:28:19.787
You got to watch out
for those cute ones, baby.


392
00:28:19.950 --> 00:28:21.952
They make a lot of promises.

393
00:28:22.119 --> 00:28:23.996
My goodness. Lookit here.

394
00:28:24.162 --> 00:28:26.915
Gonna be the first store
in Detroit to have one of these.


395
00:28:27.082 --> 00:28:29.380
- She's pretty, Mama.
- Oh, a chocolate mannequin.


396
00:28:29.543 --> 00:28:30.965
Ain't it something?

397
00:28:31.128 --> 00:28:33.677
Dr. King said
we would have integration.


398
00:28:33.839 --> 00:28:35.466
- That's right.
- Look what I found.


399
00:28:35.632 --> 00:28:38.010
- What's that?
- The other, nicer you.


400
00:28:39.428 --> 00:28:41.305
Sparkle, you go to lunch.

401
00:28:41.471 --> 00:28:44.475
You come with me and let me try
to fit your behind in this dress.


402
00:28:45.058 --> 00:28:46.355
- See how she do me?
- Come on.


403
00:28:46.518 --> 00:28:48.441
She used to be real nice, girl.

404
00:28:49.146 --> 00:28:51.990
She's in there somewhere.
Come on out, nice girl.


405
00:28:52.149 --> 00:28:53.867
See you later.

406
00:29:47.996 --> 00:29:50.249
I got Cliff Bells.

407
00:30:02.469 --> 00:30:04.938
Got my first check.

408
00:30:05.096 --> 00:30:06.188
Well, let me see.

409
00:30:09.059 --> 00:30:11.608
Ninety-six dollars?

410
00:30:11.770 --> 00:30:16.276
For two weeks of standing on your feet
and kissing rich white women's butts?


411
00:30:16.441 --> 00:30:18.819
I am never gonna get out of here.

412
00:30:20.737 --> 00:30:23.741
Stix said we can make
anywhere from 500 to $1000...


413
00:30:23.907 --> 00:30:26.626
...if we win Cliff Bells' talent contest.

414
00:30:26.785 --> 00:30:29.584
Don't say it all
dry like that. Sell it.

415
00:30:31.122 --> 00:30:32.624
So y'all talking to Stix now?

416
00:30:32.791 --> 00:30:36.341
No. She was talking to Stix, I was
talking to her, now we're talking to you.


417
00:30:39.214 --> 00:30:42.935
- You sure you want to do this?
- Yes.


418
00:30:43.093 --> 00:30:45.562
You know, they say
you shouldn't eat where you--


419
00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:47.939
- It's the other way around.
- She gets the point.


420
00:30:48.098 --> 00:30:50.271
You guys, I thought about it...

421
00:30:50.433 --> 00:30:54.734
...and I want to do this for me,
not for him.


422
00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:02.362
So how much
we gonna make a week?


423
00:31:06.241 --> 00:31:07.959
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Okay. Okay.


424
00:31:29.306 --> 00:31:31.183
- Hello, Mr. Manager.
- Hey.


425
00:31:32.684 --> 00:31:34.311
- Got them here, cousin.
- Surprised?


426
00:31:34.477 --> 00:31:37.947
Yeah-
- Not at all. Thank God.

427
00:31:47.032 --> 00:31:49.376
Well, we come a dime a dozen,
don't we?


428
00:31:53.204 --> 00:31:55.206
Coz, let me get the girls signed in.

429
00:31:55.373 --> 00:31:58.001
Okay, okay, you do that.

430
00:31:59.878 --> 00:32:01.551
Give them hell, baby.

431
00:32:02.213 --> 00:32:04.341
- Levi.
- What's shaking, man?


432
00:32:15.143 --> 00:32:17.692
Hey, can I get a picture?

433
00:32:18.772 --> 00:32:20.866
- Here you go, man.
- Okay.


434
00:32:32.035 --> 00:32:33.662
Satin.

435
00:32:34.537 --> 00:32:36.585
Oh, picture-in-a-box brother.

436
00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:40.840
Might not forget a face,
but I'll forget a name in a minute.


437
00:32:41.002 --> 00:32:42.504
Levi, Satin. Levi.

438
00:32:42.671 --> 00:32:45.345
Ladies, this is... See, 
I forgot already.

439
00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:48.302
I got the girls signed in.

440
00:32:48.468 --> 00:32:50.971
Righteous. Righteous.
Cousin, this is Satin Struthers.


441
00:32:51.137 --> 00:32:53.560
- I know who it is. You're a funny man.
- Thank you.


442
00:32:53.723 --> 00:32:55.475
This is his right hand, Hamster.

443
00:32:55.642 --> 00:32:57.360
- Ham, man. Ham.
- Ham.


444
00:32:57.519 --> 00:32:58.771
This is my cousin, Stix.

445
00:32:58.937 --> 00:33:01.281
He's the manager of my girlfriend
and her sisters.


446
00:33:01.439 --> 00:33:04.033
- They performing later tonight.
- I hope they're good.


447
00:33:04.192 --> 00:33:06.615
I'm looking for a new act
to open up for my show.


448
00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:09.827
Satin.

449
00:33:09.989 --> 00:33:11.912
- Hey, Mr. Bell.
- Hey, how are you tonight?


450
00:33:12.075 --> 00:33:14.328
- You know, hanging.
- Got a table for you in front.


451
00:33:14.869 --> 00:33:17.497
Okay, cool. Come sit with us.

452
00:33:17.664 --> 00:33:20.634
I'd rather have the manager
than the boyfriend.


453
00:33:20.792 --> 00:33:23.762
Boyfriend can't do nothing for me.
Come on over here.


454
00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:25.263
Have a good evening.

455
00:33:25.422 --> 00:33:27.299
Nice socks.

456
00:33:54.909 --> 00:33:57.458
They were amazing.
Give them another round of applause.


457
00:33:59.706 --> 00:34:02.676
Hey, I see we got Mr. Satin Struthers
in the audience tonight.


458
00:34:02.834 --> 00:34:05.337
Show him some love, y'all. Yeah.

459
00:34:05.503 --> 00:34:06.800
Looking good too.

460
00:34:06.963 --> 00:34:08.965
Boy cleaner than a Sunday chitlin.

461
00:34:10.049 --> 00:34:11.346
Yeah.

462
00:34:11.509 --> 00:34:15.013
- Coming up next is another girl group.
- Okay, go out and look pretty.


463
00:34:15.180 --> 00:34:18.059
- This isn't what we rehearsed.
- You want to win, don't you?


464
00:34:18.224 --> 00:34:19.976
Go.

465
00:34:21.478 --> 00:34:23.480
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome...


466
00:34:23.646 --> 00:34:26.616
...Sister and her Sisters.

467
00:34:47.754 --> 00:34:50.473
Where in the world did you get
those church dresses?


468
00:34:53.009 --> 00:34:55.603
What happened?
You forget the words?


469
00:34:55.762 --> 00:34:57.230
<i>Where is she?</i>

470
00:34:58.389 --> 00:35:01.438
Hey, get this man a drink.
He's gonna need one.


471
00:37:19.906 --> 00:37:21.078
They good.

472
00:37:51.062 --> 00:37:53.030
I'll have you booked
all over the city.


473
00:37:53.189 --> 00:37:55.066
Diana ain't got nothing on you.

474
00:37:55.233 --> 00:37:58.077
Hey, Sister, you were amazing.
You were amazing.


475
00:37:58.236 --> 00:38:02.867
Sparkle, I need more of the songs.
You know, the kind we talked about.


476
00:38:03.032 --> 00:38:04.705
- I can do that.
- All right.


477
00:38:04.867 --> 00:38:07.541
- We need--
- We need new dresses, Mr. Manager.


478
00:38:07.704 --> 00:38:10.628
We need to get home before
Mama wakes up and finds out we took--


479
00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:13.919
- No, stole, the car. I'm not trying to die.
- No.


480
00:38:14.085 --> 00:38:15.553
- Levi, drive careful.
- Yeah?


481
00:38:15.712 --> 00:38:18.056
You got my future in this car.

482
00:38:23.219 --> 00:38:24.266
Yes!

483
00:38:25.179 --> 00:38:28.058
Daddy need three new, pretty dresses.
Eight ball, side pocket.


484
00:38:29.225 --> 00:38:30.727
Damn!

485
00:38:32.562 --> 00:38:33.609
You got this.

486
00:38:51.122 --> 00:38:55.252
Thank you for your involuntary contribution
to Stix Incorporated Wardrobe Fund.


487
00:38:55.418 --> 00:38:57.546
You was impressed by my big words,
weren't you?


488
00:38:57.712 --> 00:39:00.386
Man, just shoot the damn ball.

489
00:40:29.637 --> 00:40:30.934
They loved us!

490
00:40:33.391 --> 00:40:37.271
- You finally hit that note, Sister.
- They didn't come to hear me sing, honey.


491
00:40:37.436 --> 00:40:40.531
We need more money,
or you need to book us at a better club.


492
00:40:40.690 --> 00:40:43.193
I know what you need
before you know.


493
00:40:45.403 --> 00:40:48.202
Mr. Manager, that was out of sight.

494
00:40:48.364 --> 00:40:51.584
Sparkle, I didn't know you had it like that.
And, Dee, you were good.


495
00:40:51.742 --> 00:40:54.962
- Okay.
- But you... You.


496
00:40:55.121 --> 00:40:56.589
Sister, you were on fire.

497
00:40:56.747 --> 00:40:58.966
You'll mess up my lipstick.

498
00:40:59.125 --> 00:41:01.878
Yeah, well, as much as I want
to mess up your lipstick...


499
00:41:02.044 --> 00:41:03.762
...I gotta go to work.

500
00:41:03.921 --> 00:41:05.468
Since when you working
the graveyard shift?


501
00:41:05.631 --> 00:41:08.805
Since I got a woman
that's got needs, cousin. Look at her.


502
00:41:12.430 --> 00:41:13.602
Satin.

503
00:41:13.764 --> 00:41:15.892
- Didn't know you was still in the house.
- Yeah.


504
00:41:16.058 --> 00:41:19.028
Let me introduce you to my family.
This is Sparkle. This is Dee.


505
00:41:19.187 --> 00:41:21.656
- This is Satin Struthers.
- Pleased to meet you.


506
00:41:21.814 --> 00:41:24.658
- Pleased to meet you.
- Hi.


507
00:41:24.817 --> 00:41:28.697
- And over here, in this corner, this is--
- We know each other.


508
00:41:30.656 --> 00:41:33.535
Well, first, I'd like to congratulate you
on your performance.


509
00:41:33.701 --> 00:41:35.374
- Thank you.
- And secondly...


510
00:41:35.536 --> 00:41:38.085
...I'd like to give you something.

511
00:41:38.998 --> 00:41:41.217
You know, dreams do come true.

512
00:41:46.047 --> 00:41:48.425
Oh, my God.

513
00:41:50.468 --> 00:41:52.846
- Levi!
- Trying to take my girl?


514
00:41:56.766 --> 00:41:58.313
Get off me.

515
00:41:58.976 --> 00:42:00.649
Let me have him!

516
00:42:01.270 --> 00:42:03.739
- Come on, Levi.
- What's wrong with you, Negro?


517
00:42:03.898 --> 00:42:07.448
Take me at least 30 minutes
to get my hair like this.


518
00:42:08.444 --> 00:42:11.163
It's gonna get messed up
tonight anyway.


519
00:42:13.658 --> 00:42:17.583
I'm sorry, sisters. I'm gonna go outside
and be waiting on you.


520
00:42:26.045 --> 00:42:29.174
Oh, my God.

521
00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:31.092
How could you do that to Levi?

522
00:42:31.259 --> 00:42:33.512
Oh, Levi's a grown man.
He can handle himself.


523
00:42:33.678 --> 00:42:36.306
Don't listen to her.
She's damn near 30 and not married.


524
00:42:36.472 --> 00:42:38.270
- Shut up.
- You shut up.


525
00:42:38.432 --> 00:42:39.729
But Levi loves you.

526
00:42:40.643 --> 00:42:45.570
Spark, when you see a train that's gonna
get you to where you're trying to go...


527
00:42:45.731 --> 00:42:47.825
...you can't wait to live.

528
00:42:47.984 --> 00:42:50.032
You gotta jump on it.

529
00:42:50.194 --> 00:42:51.992
He ain't got nothing else on me.

530
00:42:52.154 --> 00:42:55.033
What he got?
More money? Better clothes?


531
00:42:55.199 --> 00:42:57.167
What else he got?
He got nothing on me.


532
00:42:57.326 --> 00:42:59.328
But she ain't worth it.
He ain't worth it.


533
00:42:59.495 --> 00:43:01.964
- You my family. I'm your blood.
- Then act like it!


534
00:43:02.123 --> 00:43:04.342
- Act like you're my blood!
- Hey.


535
00:43:05.501 --> 00:43:09.506
If not for more than the drool that you
deposit on my couch every single night...


536
00:43:09.672 --> 00:43:12.175
-...you should have had my back.
- I did have your back.


537
00:43:12.341 --> 00:43:13.684
No, you didn't.

538
00:43:13.843 --> 00:43:18.690
- You didn't have my back.
- Oh, coz.


539
00:43:18.848 --> 00:43:21.067
<i>It's business.</i>

540
00:43:22.643 --> 00:43:23.690
It's just business.

541
00:43:30.359 --> 00:43:32.487
Levi, where you going?

542
00:43:34.739 --> 00:43:38.460
Levi, it ain't personal.

543
00:43:39.910 --> 00:43:42.288
Just business, right?

544
00:43:53.215 --> 00:43:55.559
Mercy, mercy, mercy!

545
00:43:56.052 --> 00:43:58.851
Let's get this food out here,
Miss Emma.


546
00:44:00.014 --> 00:44:02.437
The Lord loves good-smelling food.

547
00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:04.398
Smells so good, Mama.

548
00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:06.779
- Thank you, baby.
- Delicious.


549
00:44:07.730 --> 00:44:10.449
Okay. Reverend,
will you bless the food, please?


550
00:44:10.608 --> 00:44:12.827
Sister's not here yet.
She said she was coming.


551
00:44:12.985 --> 00:44:16.706
Sparkle, those who do, do, baby.

552
00:44:17.114 --> 00:44:18.991
Pastor, thank you.

553
00:44:19.158 --> 00:44:20.956
Please, bow our heads.

554
00:44:21.118 --> 00:44:22.586
Our Father in heaven...

555
00:44:22.745 --> 00:44:25.919
...for this meal you have given,
we want to say thank you.


556
00:44:26.457 --> 00:44:29.552
And...bless the ones who prepared it.

557
00:44:29.710 --> 00:44:32.839
And, Lord, as we share it,
will you stay with us...


558
00:44:33.005 --> 00:44:34.382
...and be our guest of honor?

559
00:44:34.548 --> 00:44:38.428
But not just at this meal,
but God in our waking...


560
00:44:38.594 --> 00:44:42.019
...God in our speaking,
God in our playing...


561
00:44:42.181 --> 00:44:43.774
...God in our digesting...

562
00:44:43.933 --> 00:44:47.938
...God in our working,
God in our resting.


563
00:44:48.104 --> 00:44:50.106
In a world where so many are lonely...

564
00:44:50.272 --> 00:44:54.368
...may we share this friendship
with joyful hearts.


565
00:44:54.527 --> 00:44:59.624
- Amen.
- May this food, so fresh and fragrant...


566
00:44:59.782 --> 00:45:03.662
...call forth reverence for you
in our souls.


567
00:45:03.828 --> 00:45:07.173
As you give this strength
to our perishable limbs...


568
00:45:07.331 --> 00:45:10.426
...so give us grace
for our immortal lives.


569
00:45:10.584 --> 00:45:14.259
And let's not forget the blessings
on this family, Father God.


570
00:45:14.422 --> 00:45:17.892
Lord, we thank you. Amen.

571
00:45:18.050 --> 00:45:19.222
Amen!

572
00:45:19.385 --> 00:45:22.104
Now, that's why black folks
can't get ahead, right there.


573
00:45:22.638 --> 00:45:23.981
Not because we lazy.

574
00:45:24.140 --> 00:45:27.110
It's because we're too busy praying
over 40 acres and a mule.


575
00:45:27.268 --> 00:45:29.316
Now, by the time
black folks get to "amen"...


576
00:45:29.478 --> 00:45:31.480
...the mule is dog food...

577
00:45:31.647 --> 00:45:35.242
...and the 40 acres is sold
from underneath us.


578
00:45:35.401 --> 00:45:36.823
Because we too busy praying.

579
00:45:39.196 --> 00:45:41.824
Mom, this is Satin.

580
00:45:42.658 --> 00:45:45.457
- Pleasure.
- Pleasure is mine, all mine.


581
00:45:50.833 --> 00:45:52.927
Two dollars say
he doesn't make it to dessert.


582
00:45:53.085 --> 00:45:56.009
Five says he doesn't get food on his plate.
Look at Mama's face.


583
00:45:56.714 --> 00:45:58.591
- This is Mrs. Waters.
- Pleasure.


584
00:45:58.757 --> 00:46:00.430
- And Tune Ann.
- Hey, Tune Ann.


585
00:46:01.218 --> 00:46:02.265
- My sisters.
- Hey.


586
00:46:02.428 --> 00:46:04.851
And this is the Reverend Bryce.

587
00:46:05.014 --> 00:46:07.233
What do you say, Rev?

588
00:46:07.391 --> 00:46:08.688
Satin Struthers.

589
00:46:08.851 --> 00:46:11.570
Yeah, yeah, I seen you on TV.

590
00:46:11.729 --> 00:46:14.778
You were pretty hard
on the folk in Detroit after the riots.


591
00:46:15.858 --> 00:46:19.362
Well, I was telling the truth, you know.
It shows a lack of intelligence...


592
00:46:19.528 --> 00:46:21.701
...for someone to loot
their own neighborhood.


593
00:46:21.864 --> 00:46:23.161
Well, people were angry.

594
00:46:23.324 --> 00:46:25.201
At white people.

595
00:46:25.367 --> 00:46:27.836
- Hell, go tear up they shit.
- What--?


596
00:46:29.538 --> 00:46:31.461
Definitely not making it to dessert.

597
00:46:31.624 --> 00:46:34.673
Excuse me. I'm sorry. Hail Mary.

598
00:46:35.878 --> 00:46:36.925
That's Catholic.

599
00:46:37.505 --> 00:46:38.882
It's still Christian, right?

600
00:46:39.381 --> 00:46:42.726
I mean, come on.
I understand, I understand.


601
00:46:42.885 --> 00:46:46.264
I was trying to get black people
to see it from a different perspective.


602
00:46:46.430 --> 00:46:49.684
Burning and looting your own
neighborhood may be misguided...


603
00:46:50.392 --> 00:46:54.272
...but at least those people out there
were trying to fight to change the system.


604
00:46:54.438 --> 00:46:56.236
Now, with all due respect...

605
00:46:56.398 --> 00:47:00.153
...you just trying to
make a dollar off their pain.


606
00:47:01.570 --> 00:47:05.575
I bet you know a little bit more about
making dollars off of people's pain.


607
00:47:05.741 --> 00:47:07.618
You packing them
into church every Sunday.


608
00:47:07.785 --> 00:47:10.584
Giving them a show,
got them hooting and hollering. Yeah.


609
00:47:10.746 --> 00:47:11.793
You know what, Rev?

610
00:47:11.956 --> 00:47:14.004
The only difference
between me and you...


611
00:47:14.166 --> 00:47:17.215
...is you collect your fee at the pew...

612
00:47:17.378 --> 00:47:19.380
...I collect mine at the door.

613
00:47:28.097 --> 00:47:30.270
Well, Ms. Anderson...

614
00:47:31.559 --> 00:47:34.278
...I guess now is a good time
for me to let you know...


615
00:47:34.436 --> 00:47:37.781
...that I asked your daughter
to marry me.


616
00:47:39.942 --> 00:47:41.615
Surprise.

617
00:47:42.528 --> 00:47:43.871
He asked me last night.

618
00:47:44.029 --> 00:47:47.909
Got down on one knee and told me
that he couldn't live without me.


619
00:47:48.075 --> 00:47:53.127
Sister, you're going to marry this man?

620
00:47:53.289 --> 00:47:57.886
He disrespects our home,
the reverend.


621
00:47:58.043 --> 00:48:00.967
Oh, he's a comedian.
He was just trying to make us laugh.


622
00:48:01.505 --> 00:48:03.883
He's a really good man.

623
00:48:04.049 --> 00:48:06.051
Even goes to church sometimes.

624
00:48:06.218 --> 00:48:09.973
Granted, it is for material,
but I am there...


625
00:48:10.139 --> 00:48:11.641
-...and God knows my heart.
- Stop.


626
00:48:11.807 --> 00:48:13.434
- I got a good heart.
- Stop.


627
00:48:13.601 --> 00:48:15.603
He tithes.

628
00:48:18.689 --> 00:48:21.659
Child, I think enough of you
to introduce you...


629
00:48:21.817 --> 00:48:25.663
...to dentists and doctors
and accountants.


630
00:48:25.821 --> 00:48:28.620
But, no, not you.

631
00:48:28.782 --> 00:48:30.329
You want to whore with this coon.

632
00:48:30.492 --> 00:48:32.415
- Mom!
- Sparkle.


633
00:48:36.957 --> 00:48:40.803
Ms. Anderson,
I'm probably more of a Sambo.


634
00:48:43.422 --> 00:48:48.599
I coon from time to time,
but Sambo's my go-to.


635
00:48:50.929 --> 00:48:54.729
Baby, think more of yourself.

636
00:48:54.892 --> 00:49:00.194
I know you're worried about getting older
and who's gonna marry you.


637
00:49:00.356 --> 00:49:02.074
But get older, not desperate!

638
00:49:02.232 --> 00:49:04.200
Desperate?

639
00:49:05.527 --> 00:49:07.871
I'm doing a whole lot better
than you ever did.


640
00:49:08.739 --> 00:49:11.663
Just keeping a man
is a whole lot better than you ever did.


641
00:49:11.825 --> 00:49:14.203
- Ladies, please. I think--
- No, no, no, Reverend.


642
00:49:14.370 --> 00:49:16.839
Let her get her attention.
She doesn't have much else.


643
00:49:17.331 --> 00:49:21.131
- Maybe this is a conversation--
- Me getting a husband is not about me.


644
00:49:21.293 --> 00:49:25.014
It's about her. It's not my fault
that she got knocked up at 16...


645
00:49:25.255 --> 00:49:28.179
...and is trying to convince folks
she's the perfect mother...


646
00:49:28.342 --> 00:49:31.892
...raised some good girls.
Sparkle's gonna follow up behind you...


647
00:49:32.054 --> 00:49:35.058
...and be a little church mouse
and make dresses.


648
00:49:35.224 --> 00:49:37.477
And if she's lucky,
she'll be a preacher's wife.


649
00:49:37.643 --> 00:49:41.773
Dee's gonna be a doctor,
and I'm just supposed to marry one?


650
00:49:41.939 --> 00:49:44.613
Funny thing is,
maybe I could have snagged one...


651
00:49:44.775 --> 00:49:47.028
...if you'd sent me to school
like these two.


652
00:49:47.194 --> 00:49:50.198
But instead, I was at home,
raising your kids...


653
00:49:50.364 --> 00:49:52.366
...while you were laid up
in your own vomit.


654
00:49:52.533 --> 00:49:54.376
Sister...

655
00:49:54.535 --> 00:49:57.163
...if you gonna tell my tragic story...

656
00:49:57.329 --> 00:50:00.333
...give me the honor
of getting it correct.


657
00:50:00.541 --> 00:50:02.509
Yeah, I passed out a few times.

658
00:50:02.668 --> 00:50:05.296
Sure, I've had my moments.

659
00:50:05.462 --> 00:50:11.970
But you've never, ever, ever
seen me laying in my own vomit.


660
00:50:12.386 --> 00:50:13.763
Whatever you say, Mama.

661
00:50:15.305 --> 00:50:20.152
The fact is, I was desperate back then.

662
00:50:20.310 --> 00:50:22.608
Right now,
I'm trying to get myself out of here...


663
00:50:22.771 --> 00:50:25.775
...and get myself more than
a color TV and half a room.


664
00:50:25.941 --> 00:50:27.238
It's okay.

665
00:50:35.617 --> 00:50:37.711
Well, we better go.

666
00:50:37.870 --> 00:50:41.920
Ms. Anderson, thanks for what looked like
could have been a great dinner.


667
00:50:44.501 --> 00:50:45.548
We better go.

668
00:50:48.964 --> 00:50:50.887
Sister!

669
00:50:51.049 --> 00:50:55.805
You leave my house,
there's no coming back.


670
00:50:56.889 --> 00:50:58.106
Not this time.

671
00:51:09.151 --> 00:51:12.621
Sparkle. Sparkle!

672
00:51:21.205 --> 00:51:23.378
Are you still gonna be
part of the group?


673
00:51:24.666 --> 00:51:28.671
That's not exactly
what was on my mind, Spark.


674
00:51:28.837 --> 00:51:30.714
Yeah, sure.

675
00:51:40.265 --> 00:51:42.313
Dee, say something.

676
00:51:45.687 --> 00:51:46.779
Congratulations.

677
00:51:48.315 --> 00:51:50.192
Thank you.

678
00:51:51.735 --> 00:51:52.782
Thank you.

679
00:51:57.407 --> 00:51:59.284
Come here.

680
00:52:01.453 --> 00:52:02.796
I love you, Spark.

681
00:52:05.916 --> 00:52:07.839
It's okay.

682
00:52:58.010 --> 00:53:00.138
Where you want to go?

683
00:53:00.304 --> 00:53:02.022
Anywhere.

684
00:53:24.369 --> 00:53:26.542
Close your eyes.

685
00:53:35.380 --> 00:53:39.556
Okay, you can open them.

686
00:53:40.302 --> 00:53:42.725
Your cup of coffee, sir.

687
00:53:45.933 --> 00:53:47.651
I appreciate it, baby.

688
00:53:47.809 --> 00:53:51.530
You know, Daddy got to wake up
a little faster and a little stronger.


689
00:53:51.688 --> 00:53:55.693
You'll be surprised with
what this gonna do when we make love.


690
00:53:58.028 --> 00:54:01.453
Can't be any better than it already is.

691
00:54:24.513 --> 00:54:26.686
- Are you catching a cold?
- No, I'm fine.


692
00:54:26.848 --> 00:54:29.101
Okay, from "You bring out
the woman in me."


693
00:54:29.267 --> 00:54:31.144
Five, six, seven, eight.

694
00:54:36.274 --> 00:54:37.992
Can you not hit my hand every time?

695
00:54:38.151 --> 00:54:41.325
Okay, come on, come on.
Five, six, seven, eight.


696
00:54:45.701 --> 00:54:48.375
Y'all ain't got to go home...

697
00:54:48.537 --> 00:54:49.709
...but you know the rest.

698
00:54:51.456 --> 00:54:54.551
Oh, they were just leaving.

699
00:54:54.710 --> 00:54:56.428
Baby, you got some
cab fare for them?


700
00:54:56.586 --> 00:54:58.463
Cab fare?

701
00:54:59.047 --> 00:55:00.890
You the one opening for
Aretha Franklin.


702
00:55:02.259 --> 00:55:05.638
I mean, hell, if I had any sense,
I'd be living off your ass.


703
00:55:08.598 --> 00:55:11.727
- I'm funny, Sparkle? I'm funny?
- Yeah.


704
00:55:11.893 --> 00:55:14.988
So you laughing at me
like them white folks that I coon for?


705
00:55:16.690 --> 00:55:17.737
- No.
- Satin.


706
00:55:17.899 --> 00:55:20.197
Well, you should.

707
00:55:20.360 --> 00:55:23.034
That's how I'm paying
for all this heat you sucking up.


708
00:55:23.196 --> 00:55:25.665
- Satin, I'm just--
- Let's just go. Come on, just go.


709
00:55:25.824 --> 00:55:27.371
Grab your book.

710
00:55:35.542 --> 00:55:36.759
Ready for TV, Ms. Sparkle?

711
00:55:36.918 --> 00:55:39.296
Oh, my God, Ms. Franklin!

712
00:55:39.463 --> 00:55:40.510
Hello.

713
00:55:40.672 --> 00:55:43.266
Today ain't the day
to be fashionably late.


714
00:55:43.425 --> 00:55:44.472
You're fine.

715
00:55:44.634 --> 00:55:47.012
Stix says Ms. Franklin's not here.
Running late.


716
00:55:47.512 --> 00:55:50.516
I'm worried because that's gonna
cut it close to us getting home.


717
00:55:50.682 --> 00:55:51.899
Sure is.

718
00:55:52.642 --> 00:55:54.360
Do you have any more pins?

719
00:55:54.519 --> 00:55:57.523
I'm running out of mine over here
and I need some more.


720
00:55:57.689 --> 00:55:59.942
I can't get this thing on.

721
00:56:01.276 --> 00:56:02.653
What happened to your face?

722
00:56:02.819 --> 00:56:04.947
Oh, it ain't nothing.

723
00:56:05.113 --> 00:56:06.740
He did that to you, didn't he?

724
00:56:06.907 --> 00:56:08.534
I had an accident.

725
00:56:08.700 --> 00:56:10.794
Oh, so, what,
you tripped and hit his fist?


726
00:56:10.952 --> 00:56:12.204
Get out.

727
00:56:12.954 --> 00:56:14.001
Excuse me?

728
00:56:14.748 --> 00:56:16.796
I told you to
get out of my face.

729
00:56:16.958 --> 00:56:19.302
He's beating you,
and you're taking it out on me?


730
00:56:19.461 --> 00:56:22.260
- Just go. Go! Get out!
- No!


731
00:56:22.422 --> 00:56:24.595
I don't need to hear this.

732
00:56:25.759 --> 00:56:28.433
- Jeez, she's always in my business!
- Somebody ought to be!


733
00:56:28.595 --> 00:56:31.348
- Shut up.
- You guys, stop. Don't do this!


734
00:56:31.515 --> 00:56:32.687
Not tonight.

735
00:56:36.353 --> 00:56:38.481
Please tell me
that's not what I think it is.


736
00:56:39.439 --> 00:56:42.488
We have to open up for
Aretha Franklin tonight, right?


737
00:56:42.651 --> 00:56:44.494
- Right?
- Right.


738
00:56:44.653 --> 00:56:48.908
Well, Sister can't fly on one wing.
