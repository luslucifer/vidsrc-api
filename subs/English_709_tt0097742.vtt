WEBVTT

1
00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:49.780
We have a mid-course deviation.

2
00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:52.760
Target heading 0-3-6, 1 26 miles...

3
00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.960
...bearing 062, Havana VOR.

4
00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:02.630
He's landing at Cray Cay.

5
00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.640
<i>- Advise Key West Drug Enforcement,
- Roger, sir,</i>


6
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.300
<i>AWACS to Key West, Key West
Drug Enforcement, please come in,</i>


7
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.830
<i>If they hurry, they just might
be able to grab the bastard,</i>


8
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.790
Now, you're sure
you've got the ring?


9
00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.360
Relax, Felix.

10
00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:34.800
Friends of yours?

11
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.730
My partners at the DEA.

12
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.010
What the hell is going on?

13
00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.450
- Sanchez is in the Bahamas.
- Have you cleared it with Nassau?


14
00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.450
- We've got the green light.
- Let's go!


15
00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.130
Hey, Felix!
Haven't you forgotten something?


16
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.200
Oh, James,
explain to Della, will you?


17
00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.190
No way.
I'm coming with you.


18
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.560
Okay, but strictly
as an observer.


19
00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:10.860
- Sorry, Sharky.
- Hey, why me?


20
00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.470
Hey, you guys!
You can't do this to me!


21
00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.340
What will I tell Della?!

22
00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.130
What did he promise you?
His heart?


23
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.770
Give her his heart.

24
00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.070
No. No, Franz.
I didn't mean any harm.


25
00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.640
It's all right, baby.

26
00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.110
We all make mistakes.

27
00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.410
Your escapades
are getting more creative.


28
00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.790
Not a word.

29
00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.140
He's still not here.
Can you go around the block again?


30
00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.650
- What about the guests?
- I told you this was a mistake!


31
00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:37.950
James. Just in case.

32
00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:01.610
Okay.

33
00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.190
I want Sanchez alive!

34
00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.260
Stay here, James.

35
00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:36.520
- No Sanchez.
- Damn!


36
00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:40.450
Watch out!

37
00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:29.030
Hey, observer!
You trying to get yourself killed?


38
00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.900
If I don't get you back for the wedding,
I'm a dead man for sure.


39
00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:43.110
- Do you need help?
- No. Take your hands off me.


40
00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.680
Just go away.

41
00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:51.750
- Sanchez!
- Let's go!


42
00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:17.210
Come on! Come on!

43
00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:26.620
He'll be in Cuban airspace
in 20 minutes.


44
00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:28.590
He hasn't got away yet!

45
00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:32.200
- What the hell are you doing?
- Let's go fishing!


46
00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:10.360
Forward. Forward.

47
00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.870
Easy. Hold it.

48
00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:15.510
Back up.

49
00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:24.340
Forward now. Hold it!

50
00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:36.190
Bring him in!
Take the load!


51
00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:49.980
- No. Please go home. I'm very...
- They're here!


52
00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:57.920
Let's go, James!

53
00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:37.390
- Come along.
- James!


54
00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:39.820
- Your hat.
- Thank you.


55
00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:41.270
On the double!
Get away from the door!


56
00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:46.480
You're facing

57
00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:50.880
Why, that's 936 years.

58
00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:56.660
Even one of your famous million-dollar
bribes can't get you out of this one.


59
00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:58.550
Two.

60
00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:00.620
What?

61
00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:03.260
Two million, U.S.

62
00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:06.020
A standing offer
for anyone who springs me.


63
00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:11.400
Goddamn it! Do you think
you're in some banana republic?


64
00:12:11.610 --> 00:12:14.400
All that scumbag money
won't do you a bit of good here.


65
00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:17.010
Very good. But I think
I'm gonna be home soon.


66
00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:18.540
Why, you...

67
00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:20.810
Get a hold of yourself!

68
00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:26.510
We got a nice private cell
waiting for your ass at Quantico...


69
00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:29.850
...and I'm gonna personally
see you get there.


70
00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:35.030
I'm terribly sorry.

71
00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:39.730
That's a custom. The bride
always gets to kiss her best man.


72
00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:43.260
I thought it was
the other way around.


73
00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:48.440
Oh, James, would you mind?
Felix is still in the study.


74
00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:50.440
We've got to cut this cake.

75
00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:52.370
I'll do anything
for a woman with a knife.


76
00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:54.940
Thank you.
Could you help me?


77
00:12:55.250 --> 00:13:05.250
FarangSiam thanks you.
Have Fun!


78
00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:07.660
- Sorry.
- No, no. Come in. We're finished.


79
00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:10.560
- Pam, meet James.
- Goodbye, Felix.


80
00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:16.270
Strictly business, my friend.

81
00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:19.700
Switch that thing off, Felix. You know
you have a houseful of guests.


82
00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:21.970
Just let me save this.
Take a seat.


83
00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:24.840
The department wants
a full report, yesterday.


84
00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:26.970
We really hit it lucky today.

85
00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:29.650
Sanchez hasn't been
out of his home base for years.


86
00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:32.050
- Couldn't you extradite him?
- Not a chance.


87
00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:35.620
He's killed, intimidated or bribed
half the officials from here to Chile.


88
00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:39.220
There's only one law down there.
Sanchez's law.


89
00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:43.450
Lead or silver.

90
00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:45.560
Ed!

91
00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:48.060
Double congratulations,
old buddy.


92
00:13:48.270 --> 00:13:51.470
You take your time on the honeymoon.
Everything's okay.


93
00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:55.070
You must be Bond,
the guy who came along for the ride.


94
00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:57.470
Ed Killifer.

95
00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:00.550
We're taking Sanchez
to Quantico this afternoon.


96
00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:03.580
- Hey, stay and have a drink with us.
- Can't. Gotta get back.


97
00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:06.180
I just came by
to kiss the bride.


98
00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:09.520
Felix, time to cut the cake.

99
00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:12.390
Hand me the picture
of Della, quick.


100
00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:18.030
She must be ready to kill me.

101
00:14:25.810 --> 00:14:27.600
- I tied them myself.
- What are these?


102
00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:30.440
- Lures.
- They'll keep you busy for a few days.


103
00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:33.940
You're not going fishing
on my honeymoon!


104
00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:38.070
How many others
are being held in there?


105
00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:41.150
- Where are you taking him?
- Why did you go to the Bahamas?


106
00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:44.850
- Where are you taking him?
- Mr. Sanchez, will you look this way?


107
00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:46.860
Come on, get him inside.

108
00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:48.860
<i>What is your real nationality,
Señor Sanchez?</i>


109
00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:50.930
Are you really Colombian?

110
00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:54.160
- Have you been fairly treated?
- One more picture, please!


111
00:14:54.370 --> 00:14:56.610
Are you connected with any
laboratories in South America?


112
00:14:56.770 --> 00:14:59.260
- Why did you go to the Bahamas?
- No more questions.


113
00:14:59.470 --> 00:15:01.600
Do you expect to be vindicated,
Mr. Sanchez?


114
00:15:01.810 --> 00:15:03.970
Wait a minute.

115
00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:07.210
- Okay, let's go.
- We're moving out.


116
00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:30.570
Excuse me, Liala.
Just a minute.


117
00:15:30.770 --> 00:15:32.930
- I have a surprise for you.
- Really?


118
00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:35.010
It's right over here.

119
00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:38.480
What's that?

120
00:15:45.090 --> 00:15:48.420
"James. Love always,
Della and Felix."


121
00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:50.720
We love you.

122
00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:52.290
Thanks.

123
00:16:27.690 --> 00:16:29.490
Come on!

124
00:16:55.890 --> 00:16:58.480
- What the hell's happened?
- Chopper, do you hear me?


125
00:16:58.690 --> 00:17:02.030
- I want you to come down.
- How deep is it there?


126
00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:03.630
Call up an amphibian.

127
00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:06.200
We have an accident.
Code red!


128
00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:38.730
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.


129
00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:44.060
Oh, James, I wanted you
to have something.


130
00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:46.070
You know the tradition.

131
00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:49.040
The next one who catches this
is the next one who....


132
00:17:49.610 --> 00:17:51.340
No.

133
00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:55.380
Thanks, Della.
It's time I left.


134
00:17:55.580 --> 00:17:56.810
Oh, James.

135
00:18:05.530 --> 00:18:07.430
Did I say something wrong?

136
00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:10.720
He was married once,
but it was a long time ago.


137
00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:22.040
Felix, you're no good to me
with a wrecked back.


138
00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:34.050
Let her go.
I'm the one you want.


139
00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.760
Hey.

140
00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:50.990
Ready to go? We got the batteries
recharged on the sub.


141
00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:53.640
It’ll take you the 1 2-mile limit.
A fast boat to Cuba.


142
00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:57.110
- You'll be there for breakfast.
- Relax. We’ll wait for Dario.


143
00:18:57.310 --> 00:19:01.140
Look, are you crazy?
You got everybody looking for you.


144
00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:04.480
What about Killifer?
Having a cop here is nuts.


145
00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:08.990
I want to deep-six him.

146
00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:11.990
I made a deal with this guy,
and I'm gonna keep my word.


147
00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:14.290
I don't like it.
He can finger me.


148
00:19:14.490 --> 00:19:17.520
I spent a fortune
on this cover.


149
00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:22.100
<i>Something you better
understand, amigo.</i>


150
00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.340
Loyalty is more important
to me than money.


151
00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:29.440
Now get the cop.

152
00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:41.610
Here's 2 million, all in twenties.

153
00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:43.810
It's very heavy,
but difficult to trace.


154
00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:45.150
Smart.

155
00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:48.350
Now, be ready for tomorrow.
I'll have someone pick you up.


156
00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:50.550
- Where's Lupe?
- On the boat.


157
00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:52.860
Keep her there
until I send for her.


158
00:19:56.370 --> 00:19:58.530
Hey, no fooling around
with my girl.


159
00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:02.670
You kidding? After what you did
to that guy on the islands?


160
00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:05.370
You liked my little valentine, huh?

161
00:20:33.570 --> 00:20:35.200
Where's my wife?

162
00:20:35.410 --> 00:20:39.610
Don't worry.
We gave her a nice honeymoon.


163
00:20:48.490 --> 00:20:51.460
I want you to know
this is nothing personal.


164
00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:54.590
It's purely business.

165
00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:22.280
- Killifer!
- Sorry, old buddy.


166
00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:24.960
But two mill
is a hell of a chunk of dough.


167
00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:34.870
Killing me won't stop anything,
Sanchez!


168
00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:36.930
There are worse things
than dying.


169
00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:47.780
See you in hell!

170
00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:51.640
No. Today is the first day
of the rest of your life.


171
00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:32.460
Thank you.

172
00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:36.160
- Good morning.
- Good morning.


173
00:22:37.530 --> 00:22:40.470
Thank you.
Your passport, please.


174
00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:46.570
- What's going on?
- Some big drug dealer just escaped.


175
00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:50.570
Will that be smoking
or non-smoking...


176
00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:53.140
Your ticket!

177
00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:22.630
Felix?

178
00:24:39.690 --> 00:24:40.690
Della?

179
00:24:40.850 --> 00:24:43.380
Felix, you'll be all right.
Hang on.


180
00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:49.330
<i>Hey, Leiter, where you been?</i>

181
00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:52.020
It's Bond.
Get an ambulance here, quick.


182
00:25:01.710 --> 00:25:03.230
Hi, Sharky.

183
00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:07.400
You stick around. I might have
some more questions for you, okay?


184
00:25:07.610 --> 00:25:09.980
How is he?

185
00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:14.120
His left leg's gone below the knee.
They might be able to save his arm.


186
00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:18.880
You can bet it was a chain saw.
Colombians use them on informers.


187
00:25:19.090 --> 00:25:22.390
They sell more here
than in the state of Oregon.


188
00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:26.550
I wish I could be more hopeful,
but we’ll have to wait and see.


189
00:25:28.270 --> 00:25:32.730
Chain saw, my ass!
I know a shark bite when I see one.


190
00:25:40.650 --> 00:25:44.850
Sanchez has vanished with Leiter's
files. God only knows what's in them.


191
00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:48.220
- Well, find him!
- He's out of our jurisdiction.


192
00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:50.860
There's plenty of countries
that'll protect him.


193
00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:54.390
- We can't even get an extradition.
- There are other ways.


194
00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:56.590
Let it go, commander.

195
00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:58.590
You're just gonna
forget all about it?


196
00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:01.860
No, I'm not gonna forget about it.

197
00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:05.300
Looks like Sanchez's law
operates north of the border too.


198
00:26:06.510 --> 00:26:08.840
Let's go shark hunting.

199
00:26:15.550 --> 00:26:19.780
This is the last place in the Keys.
We’ll have to try Miami next.


200
00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:21.510
Stay here.

201
00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:36.760
You stay out of sight.
I'll handle this.


202
00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:46.800
We're closed.
Ain't nobody here.


203
00:26:47.010 --> 00:26:50.040
Look, I've come all the way
from London to see you.


204
00:26:50.250 --> 00:26:53.080
Universal Exports. We've been
retained by the Regent's Park Zoo...


205
00:26:53.290 --> 00:26:55.850
<i>...to arrange shipment
of a charcharadon carcharias,</i>


206
00:26:56.260 --> 00:26:58.310
- A what?
- Great white shark.


207
00:26:58.690 --> 00:27:01.250
It's all right, Bill.
Let him in.


208
00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:04.560
Unfortunately, we sold
all our sharks years ago.


209
00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:07.560
As you can see,
we do purely research now.


210
00:27:07.770 --> 00:27:09.960
It's a project
to feed the Third World.


211
00:27:10.170 --> 00:27:14.500
We feed maggot to our special breed
of genetically engineered fish.


212
00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:18.470
Use hormones to make them all male.
Gain weight faster.


213
00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:26.840
From your shark hunting days?

214
00:27:27.050 --> 00:27:29.180
Yeah. Actually, it's for sale.

215
00:27:29.390 --> 00:27:32.290
Look, I'm kind of busy.
Maybe some other time.


216
00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:39.990
Thank you. I look forward
to seeing you again.


217
00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:42.790
- Goodbye, Mr....
- Goodbye.


218
00:28:16.270 --> 00:28:18.130
Mr. Krest said to be ready.

219
00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:20.600
He'll send the sub back
in three hours to pick you up.


220
00:28:20.810 --> 00:28:24.940
Can't wait. This dump
gives me the creeps.


221
00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:37.050
James.

222
00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:03.070
Hold it right there!

223
00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:16.020
Do you mind if I get
my hands out of here?


224
00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:19.160
Yeah. Do it slowly.

225
00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.520
<i>Bon appétit!</i>

226
00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:38.670
Freeze!

227
00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:42.200
Over by the trap door, old buddy.

228
00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:52.650
Is this where you put
your old buddy Felix?


229
00:31:52.850 --> 00:31:57.220
Not me. Chalk that one
up to Sanchez and Krest.


230
00:32:22.350 --> 00:32:25.180
There's $2 million
in that suitcase.


231
00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:28.250
I'll split it with you.

232
00:32:35.630 --> 00:32:40.460
You earned it.
You keep it, old buddy.


233
00:32:54.550 --> 00:32:57.310
God, what a terrible waste.

234
00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:01.150
Of money.

235
00:33:05.790 --> 00:33:07.730
Hey, Sharky!

236
00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:12.890
<i>- Any news on the Wavekrest?
- She's a big marine research vessel...</i>


237
00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:15.230
...owned by a Milton Krest.

238
00:33:15.430 --> 00:33:18.530
They're collecting specimens
off the Cay Sal Bank.


239
00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:20.830
How long will it
take us to get there?

240
00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:23.630
Maybe about six hours.

241
00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:25.970
I have a few things to pick up.
Be ready in an hour.


242
00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:27.540
Yeah, okay.

243
00:33:32.420 --> 00:33:34.510
Hey, commander,
you got a minute?


244
00:33:35.860 --> 00:33:38.760
The local cops got a tip
about a warehouse last night.


245
00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:41.650
Turned up 500 keys
of Colombian pure...


246
00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:43.020
...a couple of stiffs...

247
00:33:43.230 --> 00:33:45.930
...and a little bitty piece
of what used to be Killifer.


248
00:33:46.130 --> 00:33:49.100
Good. At least
someone's on the case.


249
00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:52.700
You may be a pal of Leiter's,
but I can only cover up so much.


250
00:33:52.910 --> 00:33:55.200
The DA is screaming
to know what happened.


251
00:33:55.410 --> 00:33:59.070
You know, we got laws
in this country too.


252
00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:01.910
Do you have a law
against what they did to Leiter?


253
00:34:06.590 --> 00:34:09.080
Look, you're in over your head.

254
00:34:09.290 --> 00:34:11.350
This is where it ends, commander.

255
00:34:48.190 --> 00:34:50.250
You were supposed to be
In Istanbul last night.


256
00:34:51.230 --> 00:34:55.390
I'm afraid this unfortunate Leiter
business has clouded your judgment.


257
00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:58.540
You have a job to do. I expect you
on a plane this afternoon.


258
00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:02.460
- I haven't finished here, sir.
- Leave it to the Americans.


259
00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:04.370
It's their mess.
Let them clear it up.


260
00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:07.770
Sir, they're not
going to do anything.


261
00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:11.510
I owe it to Leiter. He's put his life
on the line for me many times.


262
00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:16.310
Oh, spare me this sentimental
rubbish! He knew the risks.


263
00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:20.650
- And his wife?
- This private vendetta of yours...


264
00:35:20.860 --> 00:35:23.760
...could easily compromise
Her Majesty's government.


265
00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:27.490
You have an assignment,
and I expect you to carry it out...


266
00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:30.000
...objectively and professionally.

267
00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:34.140
Then you have my resignation, sir.

268
00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:36.970
We're not a country club, 00 7.

269
00:35:40.850 --> 00:35:44.410
Effective immediately,
your license to kill is revoked...


270
00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:48.190
...and I require you
to hand over your weapon.


271
00:35:49.390 --> 00:35:50.820
Now.

272
00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:56.600
I need hardly remind you that you are
still bound by the Official Secrets Act.


273
00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:03.060
Then I guess it's...

274
00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:05.670
...a farewell to arms.

275
00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:16.150
Don't! Too many people!

276
00:36:22.190 --> 00:36:24.120
God help you, commander.

277
00:36:43.140 --> 00:36:45.200
Something in Sector C.

278
00:36:57.020 --> 00:37:00.220
You caused us all
a lot of trouble, young lady.


279
00:37:00.430 --> 00:37:02.360
<i>You're drunk, 
Go to bed.</i>

280
00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:08.190
When Sanchez heard you ran away,
he went nuts.


281
00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:10.700
It's none of your business.

282
00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:15.200
It's my business when your stupid
little tricks get Sanchez arrested...


283
00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:19.940
...and I've gotta put my organization
at risk to get him out.


284
00:37:20.150 --> 00:37:22.980
The DEA just raided Key West.

285
00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:25.050
You caused me a lot of dough.

286
00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:27.850
He'll give you the money.

287
00:37:29.690 --> 00:37:31.710
He doesn't work that way.

288
00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:35.790
You better watch yourself, girlie.
I've known him a long time.


289
00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:39.360
I've seen a lot of girls like you
come and go.


290
00:37:39.570 --> 00:37:42.160
You're drunk. Get out!

291
00:37:43.940 --> 00:37:45.800
And stop peeking
through my windows.


292
00:37:46.010 --> 00:37:48.740
Come on. What are you
so stuck up for?


293
00:37:48.940 --> 00:37:51.540
He fixed that phony
beauty contest you won.


294
00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:56.950
- Mr. Krest?
- Yeah, what?


295
00:37:57.150 --> 00:37:59.740
<i>The Sentinel's picking up
something large on the monitor, sir.</i>


296
00:37:59.950 --> 00:38:01.850
I think you'd better take a look.

297
00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:05.550
I don't believe this.

298
00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:15.700
What the hell is it now?

299
00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:21.800
It's just a manta ray.
Get the probe back in.


300
00:38:23.010 --> 00:38:25.000
- We’ll start loading now.
- Yes, sir.


301
00:40:53.790 --> 00:40:55.950
Take care of him.

302
00:41:14.210 --> 00:41:15.980
Make a sound, and you're dead.

303
00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:23.350
- You...
- What are you doing in here?


304
00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:25.990
Krest gave me his cabin.
He's next door.


305
00:41:26.190 --> 00:41:29.680
- Where's Sanchez?
- He's not on board.


306
00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:32.520
- I don't know where he is.
- You're his girlfriend.


307
00:41:32.730 --> 00:41:35.530
He doesn't tell me anything.

308
00:41:37.700 --> 00:41:40.570
Open up.
I need to talk to you.


309
00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:43.770
Answer it.

310
00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:45.840
Just a moment.

311
00:41:48.310 --> 00:41:50.470
- What do you want?
- Somebody slipped aboard.


312
00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:53.620
Did you see anybody?

313
00:41:54.220 --> 00:41:56.190
No, I was sleeping.
Go away.


314
00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:59.090
Mr. Krest, they're back.

315
00:41:59.290 --> 00:42:01.160
Bolt your door.

316
00:42:04.530 --> 00:42:07.400
Who whipped you? Sanchez?

317
00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:10.870
It was my fault.

318
00:42:11.070 --> 00:42:13.700
I did something wrong,
made him angry.


319
00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:26.780
- Nice work, Clive.
- Thanks, Mr. Krest. Guess what?


320
00:42:26.990 --> 00:42:29.110
His name was Sharky.

321
00:42:31.290 --> 00:42:33.950
Get rid of the boat.
We got work to do.


322
00:42:36.130 --> 00:42:38.220
You'd better find yourself
a new lover.


323
00:42:38.430 --> 00:42:40.330
Don't you men know any other way?

324
00:42:40.530 --> 00:42:43.630
It's Sanchez's way.
You seem to like it.


325
00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:46.670
You know nothing.
Please go.


326
00:42:46.870 --> 00:42:48.770
If they find you here,
we’ll both be killed.


327
00:42:50.980 --> 00:42:52.100
Stay here.

328
00:42:56.250 --> 00:42:59.580
We got everything useful
out of her. That's it.


329
00:42:59.790 --> 00:43:02.750
- Take her out and sink her.
- Okay, Clive. Cast off!


330
00:43:06.090 --> 00:43:08.060
Compliments of Sharky.

331
00:43:12.260 --> 00:43:14.100
Man overboard!

332
00:43:24.140 --> 00:43:26.370
Get him!
Don't let him get away!


333
00:43:28.380 --> 00:43:31.440
- What's wrong?
- Get back in your cabin. Stay there!


334
00:43:31.620 --> 00:43:33.080
Guy must've drowned, Mr. Krest.

335
00:43:33.290 --> 00:43:36.250
Don't be so sure.
Find him!


336
00:43:45.900 --> 00:43:50.000
<i>- Launch Sentinel,
- Yes, sir.</i>


337
00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:07.080
Stand by to dive when I tell you.

338
00:44:17.660 --> 00:44:19.860
Numbers one and two, dive!

339
00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:38.880
I can see something
reflecting over there.


340
00:44:45.590 --> 00:44:47.520
Too much turbulence to be sure.

341
00:45:06.910 --> 00:45:08.470
Loading completed, Mr. Krest.

342
00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:10.580
<i>- Bring Sentinel back in.
- Yes, sir.</i>


343
00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:55.760
Mr. Krest.

344
00:46:03.570 --> 00:46:05.130
<i>Bring Sentinel up!</i>

345
00:46:06.740 --> 00:46:09.640
There he is!
Right there! Get him!


346
00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:11.210
There!

347
00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:16.470
Dive, damn it! Dive!

348
00:46:17.080 --> 00:46:19.050
Right there!

349
00:49:13.630 --> 00:49:15.060
There! Pick him up!

350
00:49:21.970 --> 00:49:26.130
<i>- All boats return to Wavekrest,
- Aye, aye, sir.</i>


351
00:51:03.270 --> 00:51:05.760
Here. Put her stern in.

352
00:51:19.020 --> 00:51:22.320
Hey, do you know
someone called Bouvier?


353
00:51:22.520 --> 00:51:24.390
Over there.

354
00:51:26.990 --> 00:51:29.650
This is an unexpected pleasure.

355
00:51:29.860 --> 00:51:32.090
- Where's Leiter?
- Hospital. Intensive care.


356
00:51:32.300 --> 00:51:35.160
Where you'll be
if you don't get out of here fast.


357
00:51:35.370 --> 00:51:38.890
Sanchez has Leiter's files.
Your name is all over them.


358
00:51:40.270 --> 00:51:42.970
Hell! I knew something was wrong.

359
00:51:43.170 --> 00:51:45.340
Those two have been
at the bar for hours.


360
00:51:45.540 --> 00:51:47.450
Probably waiting to see
who showed up to meet me.


361
00:51:47.550 --> 00:51:49.670
- Would you like anything to drink?
- Bud with a lime.


362
00:51:49.850 --> 00:51:51.710
- Yeah, same.
- Sure thing, hon.


363
00:51:55.290 --> 00:51:56.720
Shit!

364
00:51:56.920 --> 00:51:59.750
It's Dario.
He's bad news.


365
00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:02.480
He used to be with the Contras
before they kicked him out.


366
00:52:02.690 --> 00:52:05.250
Just the kind of guy
Sanchez would send.


367
00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:08.020
You carrying?

368
00:52:11.800 --> 00:52:14.970
If they start shooting,
you just hit the deck and stay there.


369
00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:33.350
Don't I know you from somewhere?

370
00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:36.020
- No.
- Oh, yes, I do.


371
00:52:36.190 --> 00:52:38.190
You used to fly charter planes...

372
00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:39.950
...for some friends of mine.

373
00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:42.430
I got a job for you.

374
00:52:42.630 --> 00:52:44.690
Why don't we go outside
and talk in private?


375
00:52:44.900 --> 00:52:46.630
Take your hands off!
She's with me.


376
00:52:46.840 --> 00:52:49.100
<i>Nobody's asking you, gringo.</i>

377
00:52:49.310 --> 00:52:52.610
He's with me!
Keep your hands on the table.


378
00:52:55.150 --> 00:52:57.080
Here we go.

379
00:52:58.650 --> 00:53:03.380
Two beers. That'll be $3.50.
Do your friends want something?


380
00:53:03.590 --> 00:53:05.680
Let me get it.

381
00:53:09.160 --> 00:53:11.320
He's had enough.
Run a tab.


382
00:53:11.530 --> 00:53:13.330
- Okay.
- How did you get here?


383
00:53:13.530 --> 00:53:15.330
- By boat.
- Where is it?


384
00:53:15.530 --> 00:53:17.260
Back behind this wall.

385
00:53:25.640 --> 00:53:26.910
Thanks.

386
00:54:09.350 --> 00:54:10.480
<i>Touché</i>

387
00:54:25.840 --> 00:54:27.600
Get it started.

388
00:54:43.750 --> 00:54:45.280
Come on!

389
00:55:13.420 --> 00:55:15.440
- Don't move.
- Relax.


390
00:55:15.620 --> 00:55:19.350
It's a bulletproof vest.
This Kevlar is great.


391
00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:21.680
You're bloody lucky to be alive!

392
00:55:23.030 --> 00:55:26.020
It's not luck.
It's experience.


393
00:55:26.230 --> 00:55:29.930
- A bit higher would've been your head.
- Look, I just saved your life!


394
00:55:30.130 --> 00:55:32.760
If it wasn't for me, your ass
would've been nailed to the wall!


395
00:55:32.970 --> 00:55:35.340
- You saved my life?
- Yes!


396
00:55:35.940 --> 00:55:39.500
It's a tough business you've picked.
Leave it to the professionals.


397
00:55:39.710 --> 00:55:42.300
Look, pal, I was an army pilot!

398
00:55:42.510 --> 00:55:45.140
I have flown to the toughest
hellholes in South America...


399
00:55:45.350 --> 00:55:49.080
...and I will not have you lecture me
about professionalism!


400
00:55:57.900 --> 00:56:01.390
Out of gas. I haven't heard
that one in a long time.


401
00:56:02.930 --> 00:56:04.870
They must have hit the fuel line.

402
00:56:05.670 --> 00:56:07.540
I'm gonna need your help.

403
00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:11.730
I want a complete rundown
on Sanchez's operation.


404
00:56:11.940 --> 00:56:14.240
And I'll need a flight
to Isthmus City. Private.


405
00:56:15.210 --> 00:56:18.880
- No one must know I've left.
- What do you want to go there for?


406
00:56:19.080 --> 00:56:21.210
I'll pay you very well.

407
00:56:21.420 --> 00:56:23.250
You're going after Sanchez,
aren't you?


408
00:56:25.390 --> 00:56:28.830
- Will you help me?
- How many men have you got?


409
00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:33.220
Just you and me.

410
00:56:35.900 --> 00:56:39.170
Are you crazy? Sanchez has an entire
army protecting him down there.


411
00:56:39.370 --> 00:56:41.670
Just fly me in and leave.
Fifty thousand.


412
00:56:41.870 --> 00:56:45.170
It's not that easy. False flight plans,
payoffs at Isthmus City Airport...


413
00:56:45.380 --> 00:56:47.500
...I can't do a job like that
for less than a hundred.


414
00:56:47.680 --> 00:56:49.040
Sixty.

415
00:56:51.020 --> 00:56:52.880
- Ninety.
- Seventy.


416
00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:55.640
- Eighty
- Seventy five.


417
00:56:57.490 --> 00:56:59.250
You pay the fuel?

418
00:56:59.460 --> 00:57:01.520
You get the plane.

419
00:57:04.100 --> 00:57:05.890
Deal.

420
00:57:16.370 --> 00:57:18.470
Why don't you wait
until you're asked?


421
00:57:18.680 --> 00:57:20.970
Well, why don't you ask me?

422
00:57:55.250 --> 00:57:57.740
There are five typing errors
on the first page alone.


423
00:57:57.950 --> 00:58:00.440
- What's got into you?
- Sorry, sir.


424
00:58:03.750 --> 00:58:06.220
"U.S. immigration
has no reports of 00 7...


425
00:58:06.420 --> 00:58:10.990
...leaving the United States
as of 1 500 hours today."


426
00:58:11.200 --> 00:58:15.000
- Who authorized this?
- I did, sir.


427
00:58:15.200 --> 00:58:17.240
I thought you'd be worried
about James. He's gone missing.


428
00:58:17.340 --> 00:58:20.500
You know him better than that.
He'll go after Sanchez.


429
00:58:22.010 --> 00:58:26.600
He's got to be stopped. I've already
alerted our man in Isthmus.


430
00:58:26.810 --> 00:58:28.280
I want that out
by this afternoon.


431
00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:29.840
Yes, sir.

432
00:58:32.780 --> 00:58:34.190
Q Branch, please.

433
00:58:57.410 --> 00:58:59.380
This is the master bedroom.

434
00:58:59.580 --> 00:59:01.380
<i>I hope everything
is satisfactory, Señor.</i>


435
00:59:01.580 --> 00:59:02.710
It's adequate.

436
00:59:02.920 --> 00:59:06.010
I'd like a case of champagne.
Bollinger R.D.


437
00:59:06.190 --> 00:59:09.490
<i>Certainly, Señor, If I could ask you
to sign the registration cards....</i>


438
00:59:09.690 --> 00:59:14.360
No, my executive secretary,
Miss Kennedy, will take care of that.


439
00:59:16.370 --> 00:59:18.200
Right here, please.

440
00:59:30.750 --> 00:59:32.870
Fresh flowers every day.

441
00:59:33.080 --> 00:59:34.810
Thank you very much.

442
00:59:35.020 --> 00:59:37.580
Your key.
Enjoy your stay.


443
00:59:41.360 --> 00:59:45.260
It's Ms. Kennedy. And why can't you
be my executive secretary?


444
00:59:46.960 --> 00:59:50.090
We're south of the border.
It's a man's world.


445
00:59:51.870 --> 00:59:54.500
Thanks for everything.
Your job's finished.


446
00:59:54.700 --> 00:59:56.670
- I want to stay.
- Too dangerous.


447
00:59:56.870 --> 01:00:00.430
- Enough people have been killed.
- Don't talk to me about danger.


448
01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:02.670
I won't be safe
until Sanchez is dead.


449
01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:05.540
Besides, you could use my help.

450
01:00:08.820 --> 01:00:11.950
Well, if you're gonna be my executive
secretary, you'd better look the part.


451
01:00:13.190 --> 01:00:15.180
Here. Buy yourself
some decent clothes.


452
01:00:18.490 --> 01:00:21.460
What bank does Sanchez use?
I need to make a deposit.


453
01:00:21.660 --> 01:00:24.220
The biggest one in town,
Banco de Isthmus.


454
01:00:24.430 --> 01:00:25.800
He owns it.

455
01:00:47.020 --> 01:00:48.890
I've come to make a small deposit.

456
01:00:49.090 --> 01:00:51.250
I'm sure my people downstairs
are quite capable of...


457
01:00:53.830 --> 01:00:55.820
Please sit down.

458
01:00:56.030 --> 01:01:00.470
We operate the world's largest
private investment fund.


459
01:01:00.670 --> 01:01:03.870
Our biggest problem
is what to do with all the money.


460
01:01:05.070 --> 01:01:08.530
We have a cash surplus
of 1 0 million a day...


461
01:01:08.750 --> 01:01:12.840
...which we ship through our bank
to the U.S. Federal Reserve...


462
01:01:13.050 --> 01:01:17.780
...thus establishing credits which can
be used for any legitimate investment.


463
01:01:17.990 --> 01:01:21.750
<i>See, someone has to help the gringos
with their trade deficit.</i>


464
01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:26.920
<i>Make out a deposit receipt
for $4,900,000 for Señor Bond.</i>


465
01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:31.400
And, of course, there will be additional
monthly deposits in the same amount.


466
01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:35.660
Of course. We are experienced
in handling accounts of this nature.


467
01:01:35.870 --> 01:01:37.430
Let me pass.

468
01:01:41.580 --> 01:01:43.440
<i>- Señor Montelongo.
- Yes?</i>


469
01:01:43.650 --> 01:01:47.240
I'm Ms. Kennedy,
Mr. Bond's executive secretary.


470
01:01:47.450 --> 01:01:48.780
I'd also appreciate it...

471
01:01:48.990 --> 01:01:51.780
...if you could establish a line
of credit for me at the casino.


472
01:01:51.990 --> 01:01:54.510
- Shall we say, $2 million.
- No problem.


473
01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:58.680
You have excellent collateral, and our
chairman also owns the casino.


474
01:01:58.900 --> 01:02:02.760
- Oh, a very convenient arrangement.
- We have always thought so,


475
01:02:07.540 --> 01:02:09.860
<i>Thank you, Good evening, ladies
and gentlemen, and welcome,</i>


476
01:02:10.010 --> 01:02:12.000
<i>This is a very special night for us,</i>

477
01:02:12.210 --> 01:02:15.300
<i>We want you to know only through
your very generous donations,</i>


478
01:02:15.510 --> 01:02:18.500
<i>can the work here at the OMI
continue to progress</i>


479
01:02:18.710 --> 01:02:22.510
We've learned so much, but we've
only just scratched the surface.


480
01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:23.910
We need your help.

481
01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:27.450
We need you to go to your phones
right now and make a pledge.


482
01:02:27.660 --> 01:02:30.520
<i>This is not for me, This is not
for them, This is for all of us,</i>


483
01:02:30.730 --> 01:02:32.690
You okay, Renita?

484
01:02:32.900 --> 01:02:34.660
I'm fine.

485
01:02:34.860 --> 01:02:38.660
Krest called me from the boat with a
story about somebody ripping him off.


486
01:02:38.870 --> 01:02:41.100
Did you see anything happen
when you were there?


487
01:02:41.300 --> 01:02:44.670
No, Franz. I stayed in my cabin
most of the time.


488
01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:51.680
- What's the matter, baby?
- You know I can't stand that thing.


489
01:02:58.620 --> 01:03:00.920
I'd like a private table. Blackjack.

490
01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:03.180
<i>Certainly, Señor Bond.</i>

491
01:03:03.390 --> 01:03:05.690
Would you come this way, please?

492
01:03:12.370 --> 01:03:14.200
Quarter of a million dollars.

493
01:03:15.470 --> 01:03:18.130
And I'd like to raise the limits
to 5,000 a box.


494
01:03:18.340 --> 01:03:20.540
<i>Put these wonderful volunteers
to work,</i>


495
01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:23.980
Dario will take you shopping
tomorrow evening.


496
01:03:24.180 --> 01:03:27.910
Spend a lot of money, have fun.
Now give me a little kiss.


497
01:03:29.950 --> 01:03:31.890
You want one too?

498
01:03:33.590 --> 01:03:35.390
We can raise the price.

499
01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:37.660
Twenty-two thousand per kilo
this month.


500
01:03:38.490 --> 01:03:40.860
I like that.

501
01:03:41.060 --> 01:03:43.100
<i>- Are you still there?
- Yeah, this is Truman-Lodge.</i>


502
01:03:43.300 --> 01:03:44.990
<i>Twenty-two thousand,</i>

503
01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:47.140
Our goal today is to raise...

504
01:03:48.370 --> 01:03:51.930
...$22,000 from each
of our meditation chapters.


505
01:03:52.140 --> 01:03:55.470
That's 22,000 each.

506
01:03:55.680 --> 01:03:58.770
Go to your phones.
Please help us.


507
01:03:58.980 --> 01:04:00.350
Bless your hearts.

508
01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:09.080
Let me have half a million.

509
01:04:09.290 --> 01:04:14.230
<i>Our wonderful Manhattan chapel
has just made a special $500 pledge,</i>


510
01:04:14.430 --> 01:04:18.370
Five hundred kilos.
I... I knew they'd go for it.


511
01:04:18.570 --> 01:04:20.260
This guy cracks me up.

512
01:04:20.470 --> 01:04:23.340
<i>- Is Señor Sanchez there?
- Yes, he's right here.</i>


513
01:04:26.110 --> 01:04:27.340
Yeah?

514
01:04:27.510 --> 01:04:30.240
I got a British sucker who dropped
a quarter of a million...


515
01:04:30.450 --> 01:04:32.240
<i>and he wants to play no limit,</i>

516
01:04:32.450 --> 01:04:34.210
<i>- Which one?
- Table two,</i>


517
01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:37.110
<i>Plays like a real jerk off,</i>

518
01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:42.220
He flew in on a private plane today,
opened an account at the bank.


519
01:04:43.130 --> 01:04:45.720
Five million dollars in cash.

520
01:04:49.100 --> 01:04:50.360
Let him play.

521
01:04:56.470 --> 01:04:58.910
Double down.

522
01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:01.400
Split.

523
01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:30.000
<i>Listen to this, our Chicago chapel
has just received</i>


524
01:05:30.210 --> 01:05:32.540
<i>a $ 1,000 donor pledge</i>

525
01:05:32.740 --> 01:05:34.540
They all accepted the new price.

526
01:05:36.380 --> 01:05:38.810
<i>- Señor Sanchez?
- Yes, he's right here,</i>


527
01:05:40.250 --> 01:05:43.310
<i>Thank you, Chicago,
Bless your hearts,</i>


528
01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:46.080
The British guy
is a quarter of a million ahead.


529
01:05:46.290 --> 01:05:48.480
<i>Should l close the table?</i>

530
01:05:56.200 --> 01:05:58.130
- Tell Lupe to come in here.
- Right.


531
01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:05.430
You have good luck tonight.

532
01:06:05.640 --> 01:06:08.130
You gonna share
any of that money?


533
01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:20.720
Would you get me
a medium-dry vodka martini?


534
01:06:20.890 --> 01:06:21.910
- Why do I...
- Shaken.


535
01:06:22.660 --> 01:06:23.680
Not stirred.

536
01:06:25.530 --> 01:06:26.960
Cut?

537
01:06:37.110 --> 01:06:39.970
- You're very professional.
- I used to work here.


538
01:06:40.180 --> 01:06:42.240
Am I going to win or lose?

539
01:06:42.450 --> 01:06:45.140
Lose. But not much.

540
01:06:47.620 --> 01:06:49.640
<i>Vodka martini?</i>

541
01:06:49.850 --> 01:06:52.220
Shaken, not stirred.

542
01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:56.950
Looks like your luck has changed.

543
01:06:57.160 --> 01:07:00.960
- Is that why he sent you?
- And to find out more about you.


544
01:07:01.160 --> 01:07:03.860
Perhaps I'd better quit
for the night.


545
01:07:07.270 --> 01:07:11.210
You should walk straight out of here,
go to the airport and never come back.


546
01:07:18.110 --> 01:07:19.840
Where's Sanchez?

547
01:07:20.050 --> 01:07:22.850
Upstairs in his office.
He's been there all day.


548
01:07:23.050 --> 01:07:26.580
He's planning a big party
for some Orientals tomorrow night.


549
01:07:26.790 --> 01:07:29.090
<i>And what did you tell him
about the Wavekrest?</i>


550
01:07:29.290 --> 01:07:31.190
Nothing. Now go.

551
01:07:35.560 --> 01:07:39.060
<i>- Take me to him.
- You loco? You'll get us both killed.</i>


552
01:08:05.690 --> 01:08:08.660
<i>Buenas noches Señor,
This way, please.</i>


553
01:08:12.270 --> 01:08:14.670
<i>Send us a dollar,
Send us 50 cents,</i>


554
01:08:14.870 --> 01:08:16.670
<i>Send whatever you can send,</i>

555
01:08:16.870 --> 01:08:18.740
<i>We've got a very special offer,</i>

556
01:08:18.940 --> 01:08:21.410
<i>You guys out there
with your beer and popcorn</i>

557
01:08:21.610 --> 01:08:24.550
<i>Un momento, por favor,
This is almost over.</i>


558
01:08:25.510 --> 01:08:27.040
<i>This particular book</i>

559
01:08:27.250 --> 01:08:31.210
<i>has sold in excess of
a quarter of a million copies.</i>


560
01:08:31.420 --> 01:08:35.380
<i>Anyone who sends in a $ 1 00 pledge
or more will receive</i>


561
01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:39.320
Lovely view.

562
01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.560
<i>It's a 49,95 value</i>

563
01:08:43.770 --> 01:08:47.000
<i>and you get it absolutely free</i>

564
01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:48.760
Bond. James Bond.

565
01:08:48.970 --> 01:08:50.670
Sit. Please.

566
01:08:50.870 --> 01:08:53.240
<i>We need your help,
Bless your hearts,</i>


567
01:09:04.350 --> 01:09:06.290
Well-traveled man.

568
01:09:07.790 --> 01:09:10.660
You did all right
at the tables tonight.


569
01:09:10.860 --> 01:09:13.290
I had the feeling
my luck was about to change.


570
01:09:13.930 --> 01:09:17.300
Well, it's a wise gambler who knows
when his luck has run out.


571
01:09:17.470 --> 01:09:18.520
Why this?

572
01:09:19.170 --> 01:09:21.730
In my business you prepare
for the unexpected.


573
01:09:21.940 --> 01:09:23.630
What business is that?

574
01:09:24.910 --> 01:09:26.470
I help people with problems.

575
01:09:27.740 --> 01:09:28.870
Problem solver.

576
01:09:30.010 --> 01:09:32.480
More of a problem eliminator.

577
01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:49.490
- And are you here on business?
- No. Temporarily unemployed.


578
01:09:51.370 --> 01:09:53.230
I thought I might find work here.

579
01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:57.240
Well, it's very difficult to obtain
a work permit in Isthmus.


580
01:09:57.410 --> 01:10:03.540
It's... Well, one has to show a special
talent that people here don't have.


581
01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:09.150
Well, that shouldn't
be too difficult.


582
01:10:10.290 --> 01:10:13.050
<i>Señor Bond, you got big balls</i>

583
01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:16.990
You come here to my place...

584
01:10:17.190 --> 01:10:18.220
...without references...

585
01:10:18.390 --> 01:10:19.690
...carrying a piece...

586
01:10:19.900 --> 01:10:21.690
...throwing around a lot of money.

587
01:10:21.900 --> 01:10:23.490
But you should know something.

588
01:10:23.700 --> 01:10:25.560
Nobody saw you come in...

589
01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:29.270
...so nobody has to see you go out.

590
01:10:31.340 --> 01:10:36.040
<i>Señor Sanchez, I could be very useful
to a man in your position.</i>


591
01:10:37.180 --> 01:10:41.710
I understand you have a reputation
for rewarding loyalty very well.


592
01:10:44.790 --> 01:10:46.980
I'll keep this for a few days.

593
01:10:47.190 --> 01:10:48.820
We’ll talk again.

594
01:10:49.020 --> 01:10:51.490
And you won't need a gun
in Isthmus.


595
01:10:51.690 --> 01:10:53.560
It's a very safe city.

596
01:10:53.760 --> 01:10:57.130
In the meantime, I welcome you
to the casino at all times.


597
01:11:08.010 --> 01:11:09.270
Check him out.

598
01:11:11.910 --> 01:11:13.110
What did you find out?

599
01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:15.560
He's sitting up there
behind two inches of armored glass.


600
01:11:15.750 --> 01:11:18.120
I'd need a cannon to get to him.

601
01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:39.070
<i>Señor Bond, your uncle has arrived.
I put him in your suite.</i>


602
01:11:41.510 --> 01:11:43.000
Thank you.

603
01:11:43.210 --> 01:11:44.580
<i>Good night, Señor</i>

604
01:11:48.280 --> 01:11:49.810
Your uncle?

605
01:11:50.020 --> 01:11:53.550
Let's make this a proper
family reunion. Give me your gun.


606
01:12:17.980 --> 01:12:19.410
Stay here.

607
01:12:38.770 --> 01:12:40.670
- Really, 00 7!
- Q!


608
01:12:40.870 --> 01:12:43.340
What are you doing here?
I might have killed you!


609
01:12:43.540 --> 01:12:45.010
Well, I'm on leave.

610
01:12:45.210 --> 01:12:48.200
Thought I'd pop around and see
how you were getting on.


611
01:12:48.410 --> 01:12:50.440
- You all right?
- Yes, of course I'm all right.


612
01:12:50.650 --> 01:12:53.080
- How did you find me?
- Moneypenny, of course.


613
01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:56.120
- She's worried sick about you.
- This is no place for you. Go home.


614
01:12:56.320 --> 01:12:58.180
Oh, don't be an idiot, 00 7.

615
01:12:58.390 --> 01:13:01.980
I know exactly what you're up to,
and you're going to need my help.


616
01:13:02.190 --> 01:13:06.250
If it hadn't been for Q Branch,
you'd have been dead long ago.


617
01:13:07.030 --> 01:13:09.190
Everything for a man on holiday.

618
01:13:09.970 --> 01:13:11.400
Explosive alarm clock.

619
01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:14.930
Guaranteed never to wake up
anybody who uses it.


620
01:13:15.140 --> 01:13:16.500
Dentonite toothpaste.

621
01:13:16.710 --> 01:13:19.470
To be used sparingly.

622
01:13:19.680 --> 01:13:21.200
It's the latest
in plastic explosive.


623
01:13:21.410 --> 01:13:23.880
I could do with some plastic.

624
01:13:26.980 --> 01:13:29.750
I thought there might be
a mess to clean up.


625
01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:32.380
Pam, this is Q, my uncle.

626
01:13:32.590 --> 01:13:34.390
Uncle, this is Ms. Kennedy,
my cousin.


627
01:13:35.460 --> 01:13:37.890
- We must be related.
- How do you do?


628
01:13:38.090 --> 01:13:39.890
Now, pay attention, 00 7.

629
01:13:41.930 --> 01:13:43.900
This looks like
an ordinary camera.


630
01:13:44.100 --> 01:13:46.900
- Doesn't it?
- What kind of film does it take? 1 20?


631
01:13:47.100 --> 01:13:49.400
No, .220 high velocity.

632
01:13:51.470 --> 01:13:53.700
Now, this is a signature gun...

633
01:13:53.910 --> 01:13:57.310
...and that is an optical palm reader.

634
01:13:57.510 --> 01:14:01.970
And if I plug this
into the bottom like that...


635
01:14:02.180 --> 01:14:04.450
...once I've programmed it...

636
01:14:07.990 --> 01:14:10.720
Now nobody can use the gun
but you.


637
01:14:10.930 --> 01:14:13.590
- Smile, boys.
- Don't use the flash.


638
01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:22.500
Stop fiddling about with things
you don't understand.


639
01:14:22.700 --> 01:14:25.470
- You might easily have killed him.
- That's odd.


640
01:14:28.010 --> 01:14:30.000
Let's all get some rest, shall we.

641
01:14:30.210 --> 01:14:33.740
We've got a long, hard day
ahead of us tomorrow.


642
01:14:33.950 --> 01:14:35.580
Good night, Q.

643
01:14:35.780 --> 01:14:38.120
Sweet dreams, Mr. Bond.

644
01:14:43.660 --> 01:14:45.320
I hope you don't snore, Q.

645
01:14:51.430 --> 01:14:53.900
You all know Truman
-Lodge.

646
01:14:54.100 --> 01:14:57.700
This is my head of security,
Colonel Heller.


647
01:15:01.880 --> 01:15:05.970
This is an historic moment.
East meets west.


648
01:15:06.180 --> 01:15:07.980
Drug dealers of the world unite.

649
01:15:12.920 --> 01:15:14.890
Extra bonus.

650
01:15:15.090 --> 01:15:17.720
Your job's done.
Take Q and fly out of here now.


651
01:15:17.930 --> 01:15:20.090
I'll make my own way back.

652
01:15:20.300 --> 01:15:22.160
I'd like to stay.

653
01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:24.390
No.

654
01:15:24.570 --> 01:15:26.500
I work better alone.

655
01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:49.780
In this business there's a lot of cash
and a lot of people with their hand out.


656
01:16:49.990 --> 01:16:53.420
- In a word, bribery.
- Exactly.


657
01:16:53.620 --> 01:16:56.960
He took the words
right out of my pocket.


658
01:16:58.230 --> 01:17:01.920
So you pay. Everyone and his brother
is on the payroll.


659
01:17:05.870 --> 01:17:09.800
So you buy a mayor,
a chief of police, a general.


660
01:17:14.440 --> 01:17:16.570
Presidents.

661
01:17:16.780 --> 01:17:19.340
One day you wake up and you own
the whole goddamn country.


662
01:17:19.550 --> 01:17:24.420
Then you take what you want. Bank,
gambling casino, airline concession.


663
01:17:25.220 --> 01:17:26.550
Why?

664
01:17:26.760 --> 01:17:28.090
Simple.

665
01:17:28.290 --> 01:17:30.590
It's easier for the politicians...

666
01:17:30.790 --> 01:17:32.560
...to take silver than lead.

667
01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:37.260
We have an invisible empire
from Chile to Alaska.


668
01:17:39.330 --> 01:17:42.860
What I want to do, amigos,
is to make you part of it.


669
01:17:44.110 --> 01:17:47.370
I want the Pacific
to be our little puddle.


670
01:17:49.880 --> 01:17:53.250
What you have before you,
gentlemen, is a demographic report...


671
01:17:53.450 --> 01:17:57.350
...breaking down each
of your territories by age...


672
01:17:57.550 --> 01:17:59.420
...and socioeconomic group.

673
01:17:59.620 --> 01:18:02.090
As you can clearly see...

674
01:18:02.290 --> 01:18:04.420
...there is a huge potential demand...

675
01:18:04.630 --> 01:18:07.820
...given the implementation
of aggressive marketing.


676
01:18:08.030 --> 01:18:09.830
As in the United States...

677
01:18:10.030 --> 01:18:14.660
<i>Señor Sanchez is prepared to offer
each of you exclusive franchises.</i>


678
01:18:14.870 --> 01:18:18.670
The price is 1 00 million
per territory.


679
01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:22.840
I believe you'll find
that works out to...


680
01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:26.380
...20 million per metric ton,
Mr. Tan.


681
01:18:45.630 --> 01:18:48.430
We guarantee quality
and price...


682
01:18:48.640 --> 01:18:50.000
...for five years.

683
01:18:50.570 --> 01:18:55.440
<i>Señor Sanchez, since arriving,
we've eaten well...</i>


684
01:18:55.640 --> 01:18:57.870
...heard many good stories.

685
01:18:58.080 --> 01:19:01.210
But before I pay anything,
I want to see some hardware.


686
01:19:02.980 --> 01:19:07.510
Mr. Kwang,
you don't pay for hardware.


687
01:19:07.720 --> 01:19:10.780
You pay for my personal guarantee
and protection.


688
01:19:10.990 --> 01:19:13.190
Surely if you
were to invest 1 00 million...


689
01:19:14.030 --> 01:19:16.290
...you would want some reassurance.

690
01:19:18.800 --> 01:19:21.130
You know, you're right.
Why not?


691
01:19:21.340 --> 01:19:24.930
Tomorrow I'll take you
to our main distribution center.


692
01:19:29.580 --> 01:19:31.510
Here you are.

693
01:19:33.050 --> 01:19:34.850
Goodbye, Q.
Thanks for all you've done.


694
01:19:35.050 --> 01:19:36.420
What?

695
01:19:38.350 --> 01:19:42.260
You're a hell of a field operative.
Now go. I'll see you back in London.


696
01:19:50.470 --> 01:19:51.490
<i>No more business,</i>

697
01:19:51.700 --> 01:19:54.230
Time to have some fun.

698
01:19:54.440 --> 01:19:56.730
Gentlemen, enjoy yourselves.

699
01:19:57.810 --> 01:19:59.770
- Hi, there!
- Hi! How are you?


700
01:19:59.980 --> 01:20:01.840
You can be my playmate.

701
01:20:12.350 --> 01:20:14.690
This Kwang seems like trouble.

702
01:20:14.890 --> 01:20:17.360
Why show them the labs?

703
01:20:17.560 --> 01:20:18.750
Don't worry.

704
01:20:19.760 --> 01:20:21.700
We won't expose the operation.

705
01:20:45.250 --> 01:20:48.020
<i>His Excellency,
El presidente Lopez,</i>


706
01:21:07.040 --> 01:21:09.440
There has been a mistake
with my check.


707
01:21:09.640 --> 01:21:12.170
Look at it.
It's half the usual amount.


708
01:21:12.380 --> 01:21:16.040
You were very quiet
when I was arrested.


709
01:21:17.220 --> 01:21:18.480
Remember...

710
01:21:18.690 --> 01:21:21.320
...you're only president for life.

711
01:21:47.920 --> 01:21:51.220
Watch the birdie, you bastard.

712
01:22:48.680 --> 01:22:50.110
Take his arm.

713
01:22:56.050 --> 01:22:58.180
Who would have a signature gun?

714
01:22:58.390 --> 01:22:59.750
James Bond.

715
01:23:04.190 --> 01:23:06.910
This is the property of Her Majesty's
government. How did you get it?


716
01:23:07.300 --> 01:23:08.560
Piss off.

717
01:23:08.760 --> 01:23:10.470
- Who ordered you to kill Sanchez?
- No one.


718
01:23:10.570 --> 01:23:12.470
He's a rogue agent.

719
01:23:12.670 --> 01:23:14.790
I've got orders to take him back
one way or the other.


720
01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.440
We're Hong Kong Narcotics,
you bastard!


721
01:23:17.640 --> 01:23:21.040
Sanchez is taking us
to the heart of his operations.


722
01:23:21.240 --> 01:23:23.800
I've been setting it up for years.

723
01:23:24.010 --> 01:23:27.680
I just hope that little stunt of yours
hasn't scared him off.


724
01:23:31.690 --> 01:23:34.480
- Get me out of these bloody things.
- No, commander.


725
01:23:34.690 --> 01:23:36.780
You're a loose cannon on deck.

726
01:23:36.990 --> 01:23:38.860
I'm shipping you
straight back to London.


727
01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:46.790
- Leave him!
- No!


728
01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:48.300
Come on!

729
01:24:10.060 --> 01:24:12.580
Don't let them take you alive.

730
01:24:55.270 --> 01:24:56.430
He's still alive.

731
01:24:59.940 --> 01:25:03.070
Who was it?
Who sent you?


732
01:25:06.550 --> 01:25:08.740
Cyanide.

733
01:26:19.450 --> 01:26:21.150
<i>Hey, amigo.</i>

734
01:26:29.130 --> 01:26:30.560
How do you feel?

735
01:26:31.770 --> 01:26:33.230
I'll survive.

736
01:26:33.970 --> 01:26:35.940
Lupe. Please.

737
01:26:39.810 --> 01:26:43.740
<i>The Wavekrest is arriving tonight.
Krest is coming here.</i>


738
01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:48.880
Good.

739
01:26:48.880 --> 01:26:51.490
Good.

740
01:26:51.490 --> 01:26:53.750
Baby. Please?

741
01:27:04.030 --> 01:27:07.930
Well, we both had close calls
last night.


742
01:27:08.100 --> 01:27:11.800
You were just in time.
Things were about to turn nasty.


743
01:27:12.010 --> 01:27:13.970
- Who were those guys?
- Freelance hit team.


744
01:27:14.180 --> 01:27:16.440
What did they want with you?

745
01:27:16.640 --> 01:27:19.510
One of them must have
recognized me in the casino.


746
01:27:21.950 --> 01:27:25.940
They were afraid I'd warn you,
spoil their plans.


747
01:27:26.150 --> 01:27:28.020
So you knew them.

748
01:27:29.390 --> 01:27:33.420
I used to be a British agent.
We kept dossiers on such people.


749
01:27:34.630 --> 01:27:36.060
British agent.

750
01:27:37.100 --> 01:27:38.260
I knew it.

751
01:27:41.600 --> 01:27:43.540
You have class.

752
01:27:44.640 --> 01:27:47.200
Those men tried to kill me.

753
01:27:47.410 --> 01:27:50.040
Who would do such a thing?

754
01:27:50.240 --> 01:27:51.710
Someone close to you.

755
01:27:51.910 --> 01:27:53.780
- Cream? Sugar?
- No.


756
01:27:55.580 --> 01:27:58.550
- Did they tell you this?
- They were well briefed.


757
01:27:58.750 --> 01:28:01.120
Obviously by someone
on the inside.


758
01:28:03.360 --> 01:28:05.760
- Did they mention a name?
- No.


759
01:28:10.100 --> 01:28:12.960
Only that they were expecting
to be paid a great deal of cash...


760
01:28:13.170 --> 01:28:15.530
...by someone arriving
in Isthmus tonight.


761
01:28:18.610 --> 01:28:20.770
You suspect someone?

762
01:28:20.980 --> 01:28:24.470
Everyone in my organization
is 1 00 percent loyal.


763
01:28:24.680 --> 01:28:28.880
- Then you have nothing to worry about.
- Well, I have go to meet some people.


764
01:28:31.290 --> 01:28:33.810
- Rest here.
- No, I have to go back to my hotel.


765
01:28:34.020 --> 01:28:38.120
No, don't go to the hotel.
Save your money. I insist.


766
01:28:38.330 --> 01:28:41.350
Stay here.
Enjoy my hospitality.


767
01:28:41.560 --> 01:28:44.430
Lupe, show him
the easy way up, please.


768
01:29:01.580 --> 01:29:04.520
You are not gonna believe
who this guy is.


769
01:29:07.220 --> 01:29:08.480
Former British agent.

770
01:29:10.320 --> 01:29:11.950
How did you know that?

771
01:29:12.160 --> 01:29:14.020
Because I know things.

772
01:29:16.160 --> 01:29:20.220
I want to meet Krest's boat tonight.
We’ll need a dozen reliable men.


773
01:29:20.430 --> 01:29:24.340
- Is there a problem with Krest?
- We’ll see.


774
01:29:24.540 --> 01:29:26.530
And bring Lupe.
She was there.


775
01:29:26.740 --> 01:29:29.610
He's not gonna lie in front of her.

776
01:29:32.810 --> 01:29:34.470
What are you doing?

777
01:29:34.650 --> 01:29:36.450
I've had my fill
of Sanchez's hospitality.


778
01:29:36.650 --> 01:29:38.780
He told you to stay.
You're asking for trouble.


779
01:29:38.990 --> 01:29:40.980
There's no need for you
to get involved.


780
01:29:41.190 --> 01:29:42.990
Give me five minutes,
then scream.


781
01:29:43.190 --> 01:29:44.620
James, listen to me.

782
01:29:44.830 --> 01:29:47.560
There's guards all over the place.
You'll never make it.


783
01:30:19.730 --> 01:30:22.290
I'm going shopping.
I won't be long.


784
01:30:22.500 --> 01:30:25.760
<i>Please don't! Not now!
Señor Sanchez said!</i>


785
01:30:43.520 --> 01:30:46.610
- I haven't had one of these in 5 years.
- Oh, don't worry.


786
01:30:46.820 --> 01:30:48.850
00 7 always comes back.

787
01:30:52.890 --> 01:30:55.360
- James, hi...
- Thought I told you to leave, Q.


788
01:30:55.560 --> 01:30:57.790
We couldn't go without knowing
what had happened to you.


789
01:30:58.000 --> 01:30:59.900
Get your bags packed, Q.

790
01:31:00.970 --> 01:31:03.460
- What's the matter with you?
- Just a couple of things.


791
01:31:03.670 --> 01:31:05.970
Kwang and his team
were British agents. They're dead.


792
01:31:06.170 --> 01:31:07.570
Sanchez is alive.

793
01:31:07.780 --> 01:31:11.340
I saw you in Heller's office.
You're working with them.


794
01:31:11.550 --> 01:31:13.600
- I want the truth.
- I am telling the truth!


795
01:31:14.880 --> 01:31:18.510
Sanchez has arranged to buy four
Stinger missiles from the Contras.


796
01:31:18.720 --> 01:31:21.560
He said he'll shoot down an American
airliner if the DA doesn't lay off.


797
01:31:21.760 --> 01:31:23.750
What's that got to do
with you and Heller?


798
01:31:23.960 --> 01:31:26.790
Felix gave me a letter from the attorney
general granting Heller immunity...


799
01:31:26.890 --> 01:31:28.760
...if he gets the Stingers back.

800
01:31:31.700 --> 01:31:33.890
Did he go for the deal?

801
01:31:34.900 --> 01:31:37.130
Yes.

802
01:31:37.340 --> 01:31:39.860
And then you missed Sanchez...

803
01:31:40.070 --> 01:31:43.100
...and Heller panicked
and said the deal was off...


804
01:31:43.310 --> 01:31:45.900
...and that I was dead
if he ever saw me again.


805
01:31:47.550 --> 01:31:49.980
There's more to this
than your personal vendetta.


806
01:31:56.460 --> 01:31:58.050
It's a mess.

807
01:31:59.960 --> 01:32:02.050
Sanchez has tripled his security.

808
01:32:05.130 --> 01:32:07.660
You'll never get
another shot at him.


809
01:32:13.410 --> 01:32:15.640
We don't have to.

810
01:32:17.950 --> 01:32:19.970
Meet me at the harbormaster's office
in two hours.


811
01:32:20.180 --> 01:32:22.780
Q, bring the Rolls around
to the front of the hotel.


812
01:32:22.980 --> 01:32:24.510
Yes, sir!

813
01:32:25.850 --> 01:32:27.880
<i>Señor Bond,</i>

814
01:32:28.060 --> 01:32:30.490
<i>Señor Montelongo,
I'm making a withdrawal.</i>


815
01:32:49.680 --> 01:32:51.910
Pilot coming aboard, sir.

816
01:32:55.380 --> 01:32:57.680
Well? Take me to the bridge.

817
01:33:04.290 --> 01:33:06.320
<i>Gracias, captain.
I'll take over now.</i>


818
01:33:06.530 --> 01:33:09.090
You? You're the harbor pilot?

819
01:33:09.300 --> 01:33:11.560
No, I'm his secretary.

820
01:33:11.770 --> 01:33:14.130
All yours, sir... Ma'am.

821
01:33:29.720 --> 01:33:33.520
- You're going in a bit too fast.
- You wanna do the driving?


822
01:33:33.720 --> 01:33:35.520
You take the wheel.

823
01:33:44.830 --> 01:33:46.930
Full speed astern!

824
01:33:47.840 --> 01:33:50.800
- What's happening?
- I don't know!


825
01:33:51.010 --> 01:33:52.800
We've hit the jetty!

826
01:33:53.010 --> 01:33:55.740
What the hell are you doing?

827
01:33:55.940 --> 01:33:57.570
Harbor pilot went crazy.

828
01:34:32.510 --> 01:34:34.380
I'd stick to flying if I were you.

829
01:34:34.550 --> 01:34:37.020
I got the job done.

830
01:34:48.560 --> 01:34:52.660
Franz! What a surprise.
I didn't think you'd be here.


831
01:34:52.830 --> 01:34:55.230
Yeah. I like surprises.

832
01:34:59.340 --> 01:35:02.780
You seem to be having
a lot of problems lately.


833
01:35:02.980 --> 01:35:06.710
Well, we had this crazy
harbor pilot.


834
01:35:06.910 --> 01:35:09.780
Let's talk about
the money you owe me.


835
01:35:11.220 --> 01:35:13.150
Why don't we talk inside?

836
01:35:19.090 --> 01:35:22.360
- Does he have a safe?
- Not up here. Maybe below.


837
01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:25.900
Have a look around.

838
01:35:38.310 --> 01:35:42.580
Do I have this right? He water skied
behind the plane, jumps on it...


839
01:35:42.750 --> 01:35:47.350
No. No. He was... Well, yeah.

840
01:35:47.550 --> 01:35:50.250
He threw the pilots out
and flew away.


841
01:35:51.060 --> 01:35:53.250
Like a little bird.

842
01:36:02.840 --> 01:36:04.100
Knife.

843
01:36:38.870 --> 01:36:44.140
Would I make up a story like that?
You must have seen something.


844
01:36:55.290 --> 01:36:57.380
- Where's 00 7?
- He's coming.


845
01:37:11.410 --> 01:37:13.270
That's not my money.

846
01:37:13.470 --> 01:37:15.440
<i>- I swear.
- That's right, amigo.</i>


847
01:37:16.510 --> 01:37:17.640
It's mine.

848
01:37:21.320 --> 01:37:23.250
Do you think I'm stupid?

849
01:37:24.590 --> 01:37:28.680
You rip me off, then use my own
money to pay someone to kill me?


850
01:37:28.890 --> 01:37:30.550
You want it so bad?

851
01:37:30.720 --> 01:37:32.420
Then take it!

852
01:37:34.430 --> 01:37:36.490
What are you doing?

853
01:37:36.700 --> 01:37:41.730
Wait! Just please talk to me!
It's not my money!


854
01:37:45.940 --> 01:37:47.930
What the...

855
01:38:08.530 --> 01:38:10.860
Please, Franz!

856
01:38:27.110 --> 01:38:29.550
<i>What about the money, boss?</i>

857
01:38:31.820 --> 01:38:33.340
Launder it.

858
01:38:50.600 --> 01:38:54.340
This is where you leave. Take
the plane. I'll see you both in Miami.


859
01:38:54.540 --> 01:38:57.100
- Aren't you coming?
- No. They'll be after me.


860
01:38:57.310 --> 01:38:59.940
It’ll be safer on my own.

861
01:39:11.730 --> 01:39:13.820
Come on, my dear.

862
01:39:23.300 --> 01:39:24.740
See you later.

863
01:39:29.410 --> 01:39:32.340
- What's that?
- Bond's clothes. They're clean.


864
01:39:50.200 --> 01:39:52.830
<i>I'm sorry to wake you, Hermano,</i>

865
01:39:57.570 --> 01:40:01.470
I thought you'd like to know
the information you gave me paid off.


866
01:40:01.680 --> 01:40:03.640
I got the guy who set me up.

867
01:40:03.840 --> 01:40:05.570
Only one guy?

868
01:40:06.410 --> 01:40:09.510
- What do you mean?
- I just thought that....


869
01:40:11.120 --> 01:40:15.050
No one would be stupid enough
to try to take you on, on their own.


870
01:40:26.270 --> 01:40:28.430
- Listen, come with me tomorrow.
- Where to?


871
01:40:30.840 --> 01:40:33.400
It's a surprise.
You're gonna like it.


872
01:40:48.420 --> 01:40:50.720
James, what are you doing
back here?


873
01:40:50.920 --> 01:40:53.020
I don't think your being here
is a good idea.


874
01:40:53.230 --> 01:40:56.590
It's all right. Franz is having dinner
with the Chinese.


875
01:40:58.230 --> 01:41:01.630
- Where is he taking me tomorrow?
- He's showing them a special place.


876
01:41:01.840 --> 01:41:03.630
I don't know where.

877
01:41:03.840 --> 01:41:07.470
James, don't go. I'm scared.
What's gonna happen to us?


878
01:41:07.670 --> 01:41:10.910
Don't worry. When this is all over
I'll make sure you get back home.


879
01:41:11.110 --> 01:41:14.050
Home? It took me 1 5 years
to get away from there.


880
01:41:14.250 --> 01:41:16.110
I don't wanna go back.

881
01:41:17.750 --> 01:41:19.450
Can't we leave together?

882
01:41:19.650 --> 01:41:22.020
I ought to be safe with you.

883
01:41:26.760 --> 01:41:29.630
No, Lupe.
I don't think that would work out.


884
01:41:29.830 --> 01:41:32.200
How can we tell unless we try?

885
01:41:39.770 --> 01:41:42.710
I think it's gonna work out
very well.


886
01:41:49.820 --> 01:41:52.080
All right. I'll answer it.

887
01:41:55.290 --> 01:41:58.780
Ms. Kennedy? I saw you
at the casino with James.


888
01:41:58.990 --> 01:42:02.620
- We need to speak in private.
- It's all right. He's with me.


889
01:42:02.830 --> 01:42:04.260
James is in danger.

890
01:42:04.460 --> 01:42:07.590
Sanchez is no fool.
He's checking up on him.


891
01:42:08.670 --> 01:42:12.540
- If they find anything suspicious...
- He's safely out of the country by now.


892
01:42:12.740 --> 01:42:15.770
You don't understand.
Last night he stayed with me.


893
01:42:19.950 --> 01:42:21.710
At Sanchez's house?

894
01:42:21.920 --> 01:42:24.710
Franz is taking him on a trip
in an hour. You must help him.


895
01:42:24.920 --> 01:42:27.790
If anything happens to him
I don't know what I'll do.


896
01:42:27.990 --> 01:42:29.980
I love James so much.

897
01:42:30.190 --> 01:42:32.490
You must go before you're missed.

898
01:42:32.690 --> 01:42:35.060
Now, don't worry.
We’ll think of something.


899
01:42:36.600 --> 01:42:38.460
"I love James so much."

900
01:42:38.670 --> 01:42:41.330
I'll be damned if I'll help him.

901
01:42:41.540 --> 01:42:44.530
Look, don't judge him
too harshly, my dear.


902
01:42:44.740 --> 01:42:47.830
Field operatives must often use
every means at their disposal...


903
01:42:48.040 --> 01:42:50.530
...to achieve their objectives.

904
01:42:50.740 --> 01:42:52.110
Bullshit!

905
01:43:05.730 --> 01:43:07.590
Bond's just left in convoy.

906
01:43:07.790 --> 01:43:10.730
Two cars and a Jeep turning north
onto the main highway.


907
01:43:10.930 --> 01:43:12.960
<i>- I copy that, Q.
- Over and out,</i>


908
01:43:22.180 --> 01:43:24.700
What are you doing to my plane?

909
01:43:24.910 --> 01:43:28.240
<i>Overhaul.
Señor Sanchez order it.</i>


910
01:43:30.680 --> 01:43:33.680
I must have a plane.
Where can I rent one?


911
01:43:35.020 --> 01:43:36.890
No planes.

912
01:43:47.400 --> 01:43:50.490
You brought the Stingers.
From now on I want them close to me.


913
01:44:22.740 --> 01:44:25.470
We started this place
strictly as a cover...


914
01:44:25.670 --> 01:44:29.400
...but Professor Joe manages
to turn a tidy profit.


915
01:44:52.270 --> 01:44:54.200
Welcome. This way, please.

916
01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.870
I'm going to have to ask that
each of you put on one of these.


917
01:44:59.070 --> 01:45:01.200
It's for your own safety...

918
01:45:01.410 --> 01:45:04.140
...so I'm sure you'll understand.

919
01:45:04.340 --> 01:45:08.750
We can't have our best customers
developing a drug habit.


920
01:45:09.980 --> 01:45:11.920
This way, gentlemen.

921
01:45:45.650 --> 01:45:48.090
Attention, security.
Stand by to receive Number One.


922
01:45:49.660 --> 01:45:54.390
Our product dissolves completely
in ordinary gasoline...


923
01:45:54.560 --> 01:45:57.830
...making it absolutely undetectable.

924
01:46:02.140 --> 01:46:03.530
How do you get it back?

925
01:46:03.700 --> 01:46:08.770
You want us to tell you all our secrets
before we're partners?


926
01:46:10.080 --> 01:46:12.570
- Take them to the lab.
- This way, gentlemen.


927
01:46:24.060 --> 01:46:25.580
Who's the new guy?

928
01:46:25.790 --> 01:46:28.160
Somebody I thought could be useful.

929
01:46:40.610 --> 01:46:43.870
- Can I help you?
- I have a surprise for Professor Joe.


930
01:46:44.080 --> 01:46:47.880
- Sorry. No visitors this week.
- I came all the way from Wichita Falls.


931
01:46:48.080 --> 01:46:50.710
- I'm sorry.
- Folks back home took up a collection.


932
01:46:50.920 --> 01:46:53.560
They'd be so disappointed if Prof. Joe
didn't accept it personally.


933
01:46:55.620 --> 01:46:58.060
You may remove your masks now,
gentlemen.


934
01:46:59.430 --> 01:47:01.360
So do we have a deal?

935
01:47:05.300 --> 01:47:07.320
The terms, gentlemen, were...

936
01:47:07.530 --> 01:47:11.200
...1 00 million in negotiable
bearer bonds from each of you.


937
01:47:12.640 --> 01:47:13.770
Welcome.

938
01:47:22.820 --> 01:47:25.310
Professor Joe, it's really you!

939
01:47:27.720 --> 01:47:30.160
Oh, it's magnificent!

940
01:47:30.360 --> 01:47:34.890
Rebuilt stone for stone
and restored to all of its original glory.


941
01:47:35.100 --> 01:47:37.330
- Is this for me?
- Oh, yes, I almost forgot.


942
01:47:37.530 --> 01:47:39.500
I got so flustered, I...

943
01:47:40.600 --> 01:47:42.660
Child, have you ever thought
of studying here?


944
01:47:44.300 --> 01:47:45.670
Would that be possible?

945
01:47:45.870 --> 01:47:49.270
Come along.
Let's see if you have the aptitude.


946
01:47:49.480 --> 01:47:51.070
To a long association.

947
01:47:52.210 --> 01:47:54.480
- What's the process?
- It's very simple.


948
01:47:56.750 --> 01:48:01.550
An 1 8 percent mixture of cocaine
and ordinary gasoline.


949
01:48:02.360 --> 01:48:03.720
Just keep quiet.

950
01:48:03.920 --> 01:48:05.050
Ammonium hydroxide.

951
01:48:27.980 --> 01:48:32.150
We already have your first shipment
loaded into the four tanker trucks.


952
01:48:32.350 --> 01:48:33.720
Welcome.

953
01:48:36.060 --> 01:48:37.990
Please join me.

954
01:48:43.200 --> 01:48:47.460
This is my humble sanctuary
away from the cares of the world.


955
01:48:47.670 --> 01:48:50.300
Your own private
meditation chamber.


956
01:48:50.500 --> 01:48:53.870
Built from the sacred rocks
of the original temple.


957
01:48:57.310 --> 01:49:02.540
I did have it soundproofed,
so nothing will disturb our meditation.


958
01:49:06.920 --> 01:49:08.510
I brought you another surprise.

959
01:49:09.020 --> 01:49:11.390
I love surprises.
Where is it?


960
01:49:22.270 --> 01:49:24.600
Look, this really isn't necessary.

961
01:49:27.110 --> 01:49:28.660
Give me the keys.

962
01:49:42.790 --> 01:49:44.380
Bless your heart.

963
01:49:44.590 --> 01:49:47.650
Your monthly delivery
will be by oceangoing tanker.


964
01:49:47.860 --> 01:49:52.660
We’ll send our chief chemist along
to supervise the reconversion process.


965
01:49:52.870 --> 01:49:56.300
You keep the gas as a bonus.

966
01:49:57.540 --> 01:50:00.340
And if there's a problem
with customs...


967
01:50:00.540 --> 01:50:01.730
...no evidence.

968
01:50:14.790 --> 01:50:16.250
Come on! Hurry!

969
01:50:23.560 --> 01:50:26.050
I know him!
He's an informer!


970
01:50:28.640 --> 01:50:30.600
You disappoint me.

971
01:50:30.800 --> 01:50:34.830
Who are you working for?
Tell me!


972
01:50:39.280 --> 01:50:40.610
You don't wanna talk?

973
01:50:55.400 --> 01:50:59.560
I can get the trucks out,
but I don't think I can control the fire!


974
01:50:59.770 --> 01:51:02.740
Forget the fire! Get some cars!
We're gonna take the tankers with us!


975
01:51:02.940 --> 01:51:04.460
Wait a minute.

976
01:51:04.670 --> 01:51:07.970
This setup cost us 32 million.
We have to try and save it.


977
01:51:08.170 --> 01:51:09.800
I don't give a shit about the setup!

978
01:51:10.010 --> 01:51:14.110
We got 500 million in the case and 20
tons of Colombian pure in the tankers!


979
01:51:14.310 --> 01:51:15.610
Now go help Heller!

980
01:51:15.820 --> 01:51:18.650
But we have a deal with the Orientals.
We've got their money.


981
01:51:18.850 --> 01:51:20.150
I said go help Heller!

982
01:51:27.560 --> 01:51:29.490
Do you wanna make this hard
or easy?


983
01:51:35.770 --> 01:51:37.700
Put him in the conveyor.

984
01:51:49.450 --> 01:51:52.820
When you're up to your ankles,
you're gonna beg to tell me everything.


985
01:51:53.020 --> 01:51:56.750
When you're up to your knees,
you'll kiss my ass to kill you.


986
01:52:01.560 --> 01:52:03.430
I'm the least of your problems.

987
01:52:03.630 --> 01:52:05.860
If you couldn't trust Krest,
who can you trust?


988
01:52:10.400 --> 01:52:13.770
Who's got your 500 million?
Truman-Lodge?


989
01:52:17.640 --> 01:52:18.910
What about the Stingers?

990
01:52:23.120 --> 01:52:25.350
What do you know about Stingers?

991
01:52:27.950 --> 01:52:30.950
We gotta go.
This place will blow up any second.


992
01:52:31.160 --> 01:52:32.950
- Where's Heller?
- I don't know.


993
01:52:33.160 --> 01:52:36.600
That's the last you'll see
of Heller and your Stingers.


994
01:52:41.100 --> 01:52:42.290
Thanks for the advice.

995
01:52:56.550 --> 01:53:00.450
Have my car meet me up at the top!
Come with me.


996
01:53:37.620 --> 01:53:39.090
You're dead.

997
01:53:39.290 --> 01:53:41.780
You took the words
right out of my mouth.


998
01:53:52.570 --> 01:53:53.830
Sanchez!

999
01:54:03.150 --> 01:54:08.050
- Are you all right?
- Switch the bloody machine off!


1000
01:54:20.630 --> 01:54:23.660
Hey. I was making sure
these were secure.


1001
01:54:24.540 --> 01:54:26.700
That's a good idea.

1002
01:54:26.910 --> 01:54:29.770
- Take them up to my car.
- Of course.


1003
01:55:14.890 --> 01:55:18.410
- Oh, God, it's Heller.
- Looks like he came to a dead end.


1004
01:55:18.590 --> 01:55:20.290
Come on!

1005
01:55:44.650 --> 01:55:46.740
You, come with me.

1006
01:56:05.300 --> 01:56:06.740
Come on.

1007
01:56:21.990 --> 01:56:23.420
Surprise!

1008
01:56:25.660 --> 01:56:27.290
Bless your heart!

1009
01:58:17.040 --> 01:58:20.440
Bond has escaped.
Meet me at Paso Del Diablo.


1010
01:59:10.990 --> 01:59:13.790
Don't worry.
It's only money.


1011
02:01:35.030 --> 02:01:36.660
Oh, no!

1012
02:01:39.840 --> 02:01:41.070
Shit!

1013
02:01:53.520 --> 02:01:54.950
Brilliant!

1014
02:01:56.290 --> 02:01:58.260
Well done, Franz.

1015
02:01:58.460 --> 02:02:01.550
Another $80 million write-off!

1016
02:02:02.060 --> 02:02:04.830
I guess it's time
to start cutting overhead.


1017
02:05:12.820 --> 02:05:14.290
James!

1018
02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:26.560
Damn!

1019
02:07:10.070 --> 02:07:12.560
You could have had everything.

1020
02:07:12.770 --> 02:07:15.100
Don't you want to know why?

1021
02:08:13.900 --> 02:08:17.160
Well, what are you waiting for?
Get in.


1022
02:08:17.840 --> 02:08:19.270
Yes, sir.

1023
02:08:31.880 --> 02:08:33.850
<i>I'll be up to see you next week,
We'll fish</i>


1024
02:08:34.020 --> 02:08:37.750
Good. I'll be out by then.
M called. He tried to reach you.


1025
02:08:37.960 --> 02:08:40.080
<i>I think he may
have a job for you,</i>

1026
02:08:40.290 --> 02:08:43.390
Look, Felix, I have to go.
My hostess has just arrived.


1027
02:08:43.600 --> 02:08:45.960
<i>- Take care, James,
- You too. Bye-bye.</i>


1028
02:08:49.070 --> 02:08:51.260
- I thought you hated that thing.
- Don't you know?


1029
02:08:51.440 --> 02:08:54.270
Iguanas are a girl's best friend.

1030
02:09:01.550 --> 02:09:04.410
- Well, here's to you, my dear.
- Cheers.


1031
02:09:06.490 --> 02:09:08.580
Thank you for everything, James.

1032
02:09:12.260 --> 02:09:13.690
Thank you.

1033
02:09:26.140 --> 02:09:28.070
You could stay here with me.

1034
02:09:30.180 --> 02:09:31.610
Excuse me.

1035
02:09:43.160 --> 02:09:47.220
<i>I think you and El presidente
will make a perfect couple.</i>


1036
02:10:19.160 --> 02:10:21.150
Why don't you wait
until you're asked?


1037
02:10:22.390 --> 02:10:24.830
So why don't you ask me?
