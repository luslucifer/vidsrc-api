1
00:00:23.101 --> 00:00:27.063
- Okay, okay.
- That's enough of that. -


2
00:00:27.105 --> 00:00:28.773
Hello, loyal viewers!

3
00:00:28.815 --> 00:00:32.652
Like me, you probably never
thought this day would come.


4
00:00:32.693 --> 00:00:35.738
I see some old friends.
I see new friends.


5
00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.533
I see friends who frankly
should put some pants on


6
00:00:38.574 --> 00:00:40.159
and venture outside
occasionally.


7
00:00:40.201 --> 00:00:42.453
Seriously, get some sun!

8
00:00:42.495 --> 00:00:44.956
But, for those who
are just joining us,


9
00:00:44.997 --> 00:00:47.834
here's a little something
to catch you up in the form


10
00:00:47.875 --> 00:00:52.296
of my incredibly exciting
superhero origin story!


11
00:00:53.548 --> 00:00:56.050
Metrocity,
a city full of danger,


12
00:00:56.092 --> 00:01:00.555
and only Metro Man was strong
enough to defend it from evil.


13
00:01:01.681 --> 00:01:04.267
Until I totally
kicked his butt! -


14
00:01:07.437 --> 00:01:09.355
That's me, Megamind.

15
00:01:09.397 --> 00:01:11.649
Incredibly handsome
criminal genius


16
00:01:11.691 --> 00:01:14.485
and master of all villainy.

17
00:01:15.653 --> 00:01:18.865
But without a hero to fight,
I felt lonely.


18
00:01:18.906 --> 00:01:23.286
So I created a new superhero
to play with named Titan.


19
00:01:23.327 --> 00:01:27.081
Unfortunately, he was a worse
villain than I ever was.


20
00:01:30.168 --> 00:01:32.628
It was then that I realized

21
00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.131
my destiny was not
to be a supervillain,


22
00:01:35.173 --> 00:01:37.800
but a superhero.

23
00:01:37.842 --> 00:01:41.471
- I defeated Titan
and saved the day. -


24
00:01:43.806 --> 00:01:47.393
I became Megamind,
defender of Metrocity.


25
00:01:47.435 --> 00:01:49.353
But little did I know,

26
00:01:49.395 --> 00:01:52.648
my greatest challenge
was yet to come.


27
00:02:02.658 --> 00:02:04.494
Blue Mackerel: You're in
my personal space, bro.


28
00:02:04.535 --> 00:02:06.621
Red Snapper: Oh, well,
excuse me for swimming!


29
00:02:06.662 --> 00:02:08.915
I don't think that
was a sincere apology!


30
00:02:08.956 --> 00:02:11.250
- It's not!
- Big King Fish: Both of you, clam up!


31
00:02:13.544 --> 00:02:14.837
We got work to do.

32
00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:17.715
Go fish.

33
00:02:26.891 --> 00:02:28.017
Here goes.

34
00:02:35.608 --> 00:02:37.693
There it is.

35
00:02:37.735 --> 00:02:41.280
Catch of the day.

36
00:02:48.746 --> 00:02:51.374
Ooh, this little baby's
gonna be worth a fortune


37
00:02:51.416 --> 00:02:53.209
on the black fish market!

38
00:03:01.926 --> 00:03:04.178
You'd think with all
the time you guys spent


39
00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.973
swimming in "shools,"
you'd be smarter.


40
00:03:07.014 --> 00:03:08.391
The Go Fish Gang:
Megamind?!


41
00:03:08.433 --> 00:03:10.518
I knew it was only
a matter of time


42
00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.395
before the Go Fish Gang
tried to steal


43
00:03:12.437 --> 00:03:13.646
the diamond-encrusted koi

44
00:03:13.688 --> 00:03:16.232
on loan from
the Beijing Water Palace.


45
00:03:16.274 --> 00:03:17.817
It's something the old evil me

46
00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:19.777
would've done
way back in the day.


47
00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:23.239
Sir, "way back in the day"
was just two days ago.


48
00:03:23.281 --> 00:03:26.576
That's all? Time certainly drags
when you're a good guy.


49
00:03:26.617 --> 00:03:28.453
Minion,
how could you possibly serve


50
00:03:28.494 --> 00:03:30.371
a bad guy who's turned hero?

51
00:03:30.413 --> 00:03:31.956
Quick correction there.

52
00:03:31.998 --> 00:03:35.251
Due to a cease-and-desist order
from popular fast food chain


53
00:03:35.293 --> 00:03:36.753
Mr. Minion's Meat-sicles,

54
00:03:36.794 --> 00:03:38.880
I can no longer
call myself Minion.


55
00:03:38.921 --> 00:03:40.882
So, Megamind gave me
a new name.


56
00:03:40.923 --> 00:03:43.760
Ol' Chum.
It means, "old friend."


57
00:03:45.219 --> 00:03:47.764
Yeah, well, chum also
means something else.


58
00:03:47.805 --> 00:03:49.599
Shark bait!

59
00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:53.853
Wait, chum means "shark bait"?

60
00:03:53.895 --> 00:03:55.688
Why, yes! Sharks love bait!

61
00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:57.356
It's a term of endearment.

62
00:03:57.398 --> 00:03:58.399
Aw!

63
00:04:00.276 --> 00:04:03.279
It looks like we're both
about to be shark bait!


64
00:04:03.321 --> 00:04:04.781
Not for long.

65
00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.829
Apex predators are
a whole lot cuter


66
00:04:11.871 --> 00:04:13.331
when you can put
them in your pocket.


67
00:04:13.373 --> 00:04:15.291
They're getting away, sir!

68
00:04:15.333 --> 00:04:16.626
**

69
00:04:16.667 --> 00:04:19.379
Brainbot 227,
launch Porta-Prison!


70
00:04:22.173 --> 00:04:24.300
- Huh?
- Hey! What's going on here?


71
00:04:24.342 --> 00:04:26.552
That oughta hold you
until we can transfer you


72
00:04:26.594 --> 00:04:27.678
to your fishbowls.

73
00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.348
In jail... Huh?

74
00:04:32.016 --> 00:04:33.684
Whoopsie.

75
00:04:33.726 --> 00:04:36.312
Chum, this is
beyond embarrassing! -


76
00:04:36.354 --> 00:04:37.688
Sorry, sir.

77
00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:40.691
Hey, Megamind! Your gadgets
are like the Titanic,


78
00:04:40.733 --> 00:04:42.193
a total disaster!

79
00:04:42.235 --> 00:04:44.028
Megamind: How dare you!

80
00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:46.781
The Titanic was a delight
for most of the journey.


81
00:04:46.823 --> 00:04:48.491
After them!

82
00:04:55.748 --> 00:04:57.583
They're in a fish tank!

83
00:05:05.717 --> 00:05:08.594
You were great villains,

84
00:05:08.636 --> 00:05:11.556
but as heroes,
you guys are all wet!


85
00:05:11.597 --> 00:05:13.307
Let's finish them off!

86
00:05:16.602 --> 00:05:18.855
Chum, cube me.

87
00:05:24.235 --> 00:05:25.361
- Huh?
- What the?


88
00:05:25.403 --> 00:05:26.946
Bullseye!

89
00:05:26.988 --> 00:05:29.198
Ha!

90
00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.867
Alley-oop.

91
00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:37.749
Whoa!

92
00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:39.542
Water in the hole!

93
00:05:39.584 --> 00:05:40.752
Huh?

94
00:05:51.262 --> 00:05:53.431
Chum:
Sir, those bystanders are about to get squished!


95
00:05:53.473 --> 00:05:55.850
It does not look
good for them.


96
00:05:55.892 --> 00:05:57.560
Oh, right! I'm a hero now.

97
00:05:57.602 --> 00:06:00.271
May I suggest
the portal bazooka?


98
00:06:00.521 --> 00:06:03.024
You read my mind, Chum.

99
00:06:08.696 --> 00:06:09.906
Kids: Yay!

100
00:06:17.997 --> 00:06:21.250
Ah, shark!

101
00:06:22.335 --> 00:06:25.463
Crime.
It's a hard halibut to break.


102
00:06:26.881 --> 00:06:28.674
Chum, make a note.
No more puns.


103
00:06:28.716 --> 00:06:31.260
They're beneath us.

104
00:06:31.302 --> 00:06:33.554
Halibut! Like the fish!

105
00:06:33.596 --> 00:06:36.391
Brilliant, sir!
Just brilliant!


106
00:06:36.432 --> 00:06:38.434
**

107
00:06:38.476 --> 00:06:40.478
And tell all your evil friends

108
00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.271
Metrocity has a new defender,

109
00:06:42.313 --> 00:06:45.525
and his name is Megamind!

110
00:06:48.277 --> 00:06:52.281
Aren't you forgetting
another defender, sir?


111
00:06:52.323 --> 00:06:53.616
Don't think so.

112
00:06:53.658 --> 00:06:55.451
You didn't, by chance,
forget about someone who,


113
00:06:55.493 --> 00:06:58.538
I don't know, say,
gallantly fought by your side?


114
00:06:59.163 --> 00:07:02.500
Ah, of course! How could
I have possibly forgotten?


115
00:07:02.542 --> 00:07:05.461
- Chum, my friend?
- Yes, sir?


116
00:07:06.963 --> 00:07:09.340
Fix Brainbot 227.

117
00:07:09.382 --> 00:07:11.467
That short-out was
a little embarrassing.


118
00:07:11.509 --> 00:07:15.346
Remember, I have a super
heroic image to maintain.


119
00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:23.187
Crime continues to plunge
since Megamind saved Metro city


120
00:07:23.229 --> 00:07:25.648
from the clutches of evil.
But now, villains,


121
00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:27.984
many who flew below
Metro Man's radar,


122
00:07:28.025 --> 00:07:29.444
are coming out of the woodwork.

123
00:07:29.485 --> 00:07:33.239
So far, our new blue hero
seems up to the task.


124
00:07:33.281 --> 00:07:36.242
And while many changes
are afoot in Metro City,


125
00:07:36.284 --> 00:07:40.246
the one constant is me,
Roxanne Ritchi,


126
00:07:40.288 --> 00:07:43.541
reporting on
the accomplishments of others.


127
00:07:43.583 --> 00:07:45.918
Huh. Honestly,
how did that sound? -


128
00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:48.713
Child:
Like you just realized you've lost all interest in your job,


129
00:07:48.755 --> 00:07:50.465
and you're going through
the motions.


130
00:07:50.506 --> 00:07:52.216
Other than that, slam dunk!

131
00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.510
- And you are?
- Keiko Morita,


132
00:07:54.552 --> 00:07:56.846
president of Megamind's
number-one streaming online


133
00:07:56.888 --> 00:07:58.264
fan club MegaWatch,

134
00:07:58.306 --> 00:08:00.516
covering all things blue
and super-heroic in Metro City.


135
00:08:00.558 --> 00:08:04.520
- Um... okay.
- Have time for a few questions?


136
00:08:04.562 --> 00:08:06.355
What is happening right now?

137
00:08:06.397 --> 00:08:08.733
Roxanne Ritchi,
you just helped Megamind


138
00:08:08.775 --> 00:08:10.068
save the city from Titan.

139
00:08:10.109 --> 00:08:11.903
So what's your
awesome next step?


140
00:08:11.944 --> 00:08:14.906
Next step?
A-And are you recording this?


141
00:08:14.947 --> 00:08:17.075
Don't worry, it's great!

142
00:08:17.116 --> 00:08:19.535
Obviously, you're too cool
to be just on television.


143
00:08:19.577 --> 00:08:22.038
You're a shark.
You have to keep moving, girl!


144
00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:25.750
- You gotta have a side hustle!
- You're not wrong.


145
00:08:26.209 --> 00:08:28.544
I don't know.
Reporting is important,


146
00:08:28.586 --> 00:08:31.130
but Megamind has been
a hero for only a few days,


147
00:08:31.172 --> 00:08:33.925
and he's already making
a big difference in this city.


148
00:08:33.966 --> 00:08:35.843
Can't help thinking
maybe there's a way


149
00:08:35.885 --> 00:08:37.929
I can be doing more, too.

150
00:08:38.679 --> 00:08:41.724
Wait, why am I telling you
this? How old are you again?


151
00:08:41.766 --> 00:08:43.476
- You first.
- Touché.


152
00:08:43.518 --> 00:08:46.104
What you need to do is find
the thing you wanna do


153
00:08:46.145 --> 00:08:48.106
and go for it.
Look at me!


154
00:08:48.147 --> 00:08:49.732
A few weeks ago,
I was a middle schooler


155
00:08:49.774 --> 00:08:51.234
sitting in detention. Now,

156
00:08:51.275 --> 00:08:54.028
I'm streaming a show with
a half-million subscribers.


157
00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:56.364
Did you say half million?

158
00:08:56.406 --> 00:08:58.157
That's like

159
00:08:58.199 --> 00:08:59.826
- not counting family and pets.
- Keiko Morita: Gotta go.


160
00:08:59.867 --> 00:09:02.578
Wanna get a better shot of
the ceremony before it starts.


161
00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:05.957
- Good talk though.
- Yeah! Good talk.


162
00:09:05.998 --> 00:09:07.625
Half million...

163
00:09:08.543 --> 00:09:12.255
For his ongoing heroic actions
as Metro's defender,


164
00:09:12.296 --> 00:09:15.842
- I award Megamind
the key to our fair city. -


165
00:09:15.883 --> 00:09:19.220
I-I mean,
why not, right? -


166
00:09:19.262 --> 00:09:21.472
- Crowd: Megamind! Megamind!
- Thank you, thank you.


167
00:09:21.514 --> 00:09:23.349
You're very kind.

168
00:09:28.563 --> 00:09:32.024
Chum, be a good assistant
and deal with this for me.


169
00:09:32.066 --> 00:09:35.278
Whoa!

170
00:09:35.319 --> 00:09:38.239
Been getting some feedback

171
00:09:38.281 --> 00:09:41.993
that some of my speeches have
been running a little long,


172
00:09:42.034 --> 00:09:44.037
so I cut this one down...

173
00:09:44.078 --> 00:09:45.705
...to step length.

174
00:09:46.956 --> 00:09:49.125
Since the dawn of time,

175
00:09:49.167 --> 00:09:52.295
man has been dealing
with good versus evil.


176
00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:55.590
Hey, Chum.
How's the new hero gig going?


177
00:09:56.716 --> 00:09:58.468
Everything's changed for him.

178
00:09:58.509 --> 00:10:01.637
- Me, not so much.
- I know what you mean.


179
00:10:01.679 --> 00:10:03.181
I thought I was more to him.

180
00:10:03.222 --> 00:10:05.850
I thought I was
like his sidekick.


181
00:10:05.892 --> 00:10:07.977
But he still just
sees me as the minion


182
00:10:08.019 --> 00:10:11.397
who fixes his brainbots
and washes his socks.


183
00:10:11.439 --> 00:10:14.400
You know, someone
very recently told me,


184
00:10:14.442 --> 00:10:16.736
if you know what you want,
go for it.


185
00:10:16.778 --> 00:10:20.823
So, tell Megamind you want
a promotion to sidekick.


186
00:10:20.865 --> 00:10:22.533
Oh, it's not
a minion's place to--


187
00:10:22.575 --> 00:10:24.619
Roxanne Ritchi:
But you're not a minion.


188
00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:26.120
You're more than that.

189
00:10:26.162 --> 00:10:27.789
Maybe you just need
to remind him


190
00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:29.832
how valuable you really are.

191
00:10:29.874 --> 00:10:31.501
Speak from the heart.

192
00:10:31.542 --> 00:10:33.711
You're right.

193
00:10:33.753 --> 00:10:36.005
I need to speak from the heart.

194
00:10:36.047 --> 00:10:38.800
And that's why
you're all so lucky


195
00:10:38.841 --> 00:10:42.428
to have me as your hero.

196
00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:44.097
Megamind out!

197
00:10:45.139 --> 00:10:47.725
Uh! Excuse me!
Megamind?


198
00:10:47.767 --> 00:10:50.436
I'm Keiko Morita,
president of your fan club.


199
00:10:50.478 --> 00:10:53.481
President?
Oh, I have nothing but respect


200
00:10:53.523 --> 00:10:56.025
- for those who assume power.
- Then you'll love this.


201
00:10:56.067 --> 00:10:57.693
I'm also your new
social media manager,


202
00:10:57.735 --> 00:10:59.987
streaming content creator,
and image consultant.


203
00:11:00.029 --> 00:11:02.365
Those are a lot of words
I don't understand.


204
00:11:02.407 --> 00:11:04.117
Whoa! Is that
the disguise generator?


205
00:11:04.158 --> 00:11:06.160
- Can I try it?
- Don't touch that!


206
00:11:06.202 --> 00:11:08.663
It's a highly sophisticated
electronic device.


207
00:11:08.705 --> 00:11:11.040
It's cool! My generation
was born tech-savvy.


208
00:11:11.082 --> 00:11:14.544
Really? Then I suppose this is
one of those smarty-pants phones


209
00:11:14.585 --> 00:11:16.379
with a calculator
built right in.


210
00:11:16.421 --> 00:11:19.048
Okay, wow. That proves
you really need my help.


211
00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:21.092
You were threatening
the city a few days ago.


212
00:11:21.134 --> 00:11:22.468
Now you're defending it!

213
00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:25.179
People wanna know who
the new heroic Megamind is!


214
00:11:25.221 --> 00:11:27.265
I'll help you show them.

215
00:11:27.306 --> 00:11:28.599
You have a lot of energy.

216
00:11:28.641 --> 00:11:30.727
Did you just consume
a pound of sugar?


217
00:11:30.768 --> 00:11:32.311
Nope!
I'm like this naturally!


218
00:11:32.353 --> 00:11:34.272
Must be exhausting.

219
00:11:34.313 --> 00:11:36.899
I wanna be a crime fighter
just like you.


220
00:11:36.941 --> 00:11:38.359
You know, part of the team.

221
00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:40.737
Here's the thing.

222
00:11:40.778 --> 00:11:42.321
I don't do teams.

223
00:11:42.363 --> 00:11:43.990
I'm more of a solo act,

224
00:11:44.031 --> 00:11:46.743
but you're adorable
in a pushy sort of way.


225
00:11:46.784 --> 00:11:48.536
So, here's a souvenir.

226
00:11:48.578 --> 00:11:51.414
It's either a paperweight
or a flash grenade.


227
00:11:51.456 --> 00:11:54.709
I can't remember which,
so careful with that.


228
00:11:55.043 --> 00:11:56.627
He'll come around.

229
00:11:57.170 --> 00:11:59.464
Here he comes. You ready?

230
00:11:59.505 --> 00:12:00.590
Oh, absolutely!

231
00:12:00.631 --> 00:12:02.884
Had the brainbots
program an algorithm


232
00:12:02.925 --> 00:12:05.595
for a surefire
negotiation speech.


233
00:12:05.636 --> 00:12:08.139
Not what I meant by
speaking from the heart.


234
00:12:08.848 --> 00:12:11.601
Ah, there you are, Chum.
Let's head back to the lair.


235
00:12:11.642 --> 00:12:13.603
Those socks aren't
gonna wash themselves.


236
00:12:17.982 --> 00:12:19.859
Good afternoon!

237
00:12:19.901 --> 00:12:21.903
Do you aspire for success?

238
00:12:21.944 --> 00:12:23.112
I bet you do.

239
00:12:23.488 --> 00:12:26.574
Well, insert boss' name here,
while I humbly appreciate


240
00:12:26.616 --> 00:12:28.701
the opportunities
you've given me,


241
00:12:28.743 --> 00:12:31.996
since we've altered the mission
statement of our organization,


242
00:12:32.038 --> 00:12:34.123
I'm confident
I could achieve more.


243
00:12:34.165 --> 00:12:36.209
I believe I have made

244
00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:38.961
significant contributions
to the new paradigm


245
00:12:39.003 --> 00:12:41.255
and wish for
positional advancement


246
00:12:41.297 --> 00:12:43.966
befitting my more than
adequate executions


247
00:12:44.008 --> 00:12:47.261
of said opportunities.

248
00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:52.725
Chum, you're talking gibberish.

249
00:12:52.767 --> 00:12:55.019
Might be time to change
your bowl water again.


250
00:12:55.061 --> 00:12:58.523
Uh, what I'm trying to ask,
uh...


251
00:12:58.564 --> 00:13:01.984
Chum wants a promotion!
He wants to be your sidekick.


252
00:13:02.026 --> 00:13:04.862
Sidekick?
That's a big change.


253
00:13:05.613 --> 00:13:08.324
I don't think you've thought
through this, old friend.


254
00:13:08.366 --> 00:13:11.285
We've got a dynamic here.
I'm the hero.


255
00:13:11.327 --> 00:13:13.663
You're the guy who gets
to hang out with the hero.


256
00:13:13.705 --> 00:13:15.957
Now, with that
firmly reestablished,


257
00:13:15.998 --> 00:13:18.876
let's go get some churros.

258
00:13:20.753 --> 00:13:23.673
Sir, if you don't
recognize my contributions,


259
00:13:23.715 --> 00:13:27.719
maybe it's time for me to
explore other opportunities.


260
00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:29.679
Hm. Okay.

261
00:13:29.721 --> 00:13:33.558
- Well, if you feel that
strongly about it... - Oh.


262
00:13:33.599 --> 00:13:35.143
Okay then. Uh...

263
00:13:35.184 --> 00:13:38.521
If you feel that strongly about
me feeling strongly about it--


264
00:13:38.563 --> 00:13:41.566
I feel strongly about
you feeling strongly


265
00:13:41.607 --> 00:13:44.235
that I feel strongly about
you feeling strongly.


266
00:13:44.277 --> 00:13:47.280
Okay, we get it!
Everyone's feeling strongly.


267
00:13:47.321 --> 00:13:50.700
No, Roxanne!
Who am I to clip Chum's wings?


268
00:13:50.742 --> 00:13:54.203
I say fly,
you magnificent dove.


269
00:13:54.245 --> 00:13:56.873
Yes. I will fly.

270
00:13:57.331 --> 00:14:00.752
I thank you for all
the good times we had.


271
00:14:01.919 --> 00:14:05.256
We part now on friendly terms.

272
00:14:13.389 --> 00:14:15.058
I'll be a monkey's uncle!

273
00:14:15.099 --> 00:14:16.934
He's really
walking away this time!


274
00:14:16.976 --> 00:14:20.188
- I don't believe you.
- It's just a figure of speech.


275
00:14:20.229 --> 00:14:21.856
I'm not really
a monkey's uncle.


276
00:14:21.898 --> 00:14:25.401
I mean, I can't believe
you just let him quit!


277
00:14:25.443 --> 00:14:28.696
Relax.
It's a negotiation tactic.


278
00:14:28.738 --> 00:14:30.406
Like the time he went
on a hunger strike


279
00:14:30.448 --> 00:14:32.283
because he wanted
a pet parakeet.


280
00:14:32.325 --> 00:14:33.493
What did you do then?

281
00:14:33.534 --> 00:14:35.953
I waited him out
until he finally gave in.


282
00:14:35.995 --> 00:14:38.247
Parakeets are poop machines.

283
00:14:38.289 --> 00:14:40.750
Everything is changing so fast.

284
00:14:40.792 --> 00:14:44.837
Sometimes, I miss the simplicity
of the bad old days.


285
00:14:47.131 --> 00:14:48.674
**

286
00:14:55.139 --> 00:14:58.810
I hereby call this meeting
of The Doom Syndicate to order.


287
00:14:58.851 --> 00:15:01.562
First order of business,
evil villain roll call.


288
00:15:01.604 --> 00:15:05.274
Lady Doppler, evil witch
of weather, present.


289
00:15:05.316 --> 00:15:07.902
Pierre Pressure,
master of hypnotism


290
00:15:07.944 --> 00:15:11.823
and all-around super bad guy
is also present, no?


291
00:15:13.199 --> 00:15:16.244
Behemoth, burning hunk
of burning rock,


292
00:15:16.285 --> 00:15:18.287
also bring present.

293
00:15:19.997 --> 00:15:22.583
My lava friend,
present means one is here.


294
00:15:22.625 --> 00:15:23.918
Huh?

295
00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:25.753
Aw, that's okay, Behemoth.

296
00:15:25.795 --> 00:15:28.548
It's the thought
that counts, hm?


297
00:15:28.589 --> 00:15:31.551
Okay, I think that's just about everyone.

298
00:15:31.592 --> 00:15:34.303
Mysterious Voice:
Aren't you forgetting someone?


299
00:15:34.345 --> 00:15:36.264
The Master of Nightmares,

300
00:15:36.305 --> 00:15:37.932
the Duke of Darkness,

301
00:15:37.974 --> 00:15:41.185
the broken nightlight
in your cold bedroom.


302
00:15:41.227 --> 00:15:43.604
Sit and tremble
as you gaze upon


303
00:15:43.646 --> 00:15:45.648
the frightening sight of...

304
00:15:45.690 --> 00:15:48.234
Lord Nighty
-Knight!

305
00:15:49.986 --> 00:15:51.320
That is, like,

306
00:15:51.362 --> 00:15:54.532
the least frightening
villain name ever!


307
00:15:54.574 --> 00:15:56.033
Why did you change it
from Fright Night?


308
00:15:56.075 --> 00:15:57.869
That was so much better.

309
00:15:57.910 --> 00:15:59.871
Lord Nighty-Knight:
What are you talking about? It's Nighty-Knight.


310
00:15:59.912 --> 00:16:03.207
It's like a night that's even
darker than a usual night.


311
00:16:03.249 --> 00:16:06.627
Plus, I'm an actual knight,
which is also super dark.


312
00:16:06.669 --> 00:16:08.963
But is it dark?

313
00:16:12.216 --> 00:16:13.843
On to serious business.

314
00:16:13.885 --> 00:16:15.428
It seems our former leader
Megamind


315
00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:17.055
just got himself a new gig.

316
00:16:17.096 --> 00:16:18.431
Anchor:
Breaking news.


317
00:16:18.473 --> 00:16:20.099
Megamind gets
the key to the city


318
00:16:20.141 --> 00:16:21.851
as Metro City's newest hero.

319
00:16:21.893 --> 00:16:24.103
No way!

320
00:16:24.145 --> 00:16:26.189
As leader, I've decided

321
00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:28.858
it's time to pay
Megamind a visit.


322
00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:30.276
Say what?!

323
00:16:30.318 --> 00:16:32.153
Behemoth leader!

324
00:16:32.195 --> 00:16:34.614
You are not ze leader!
It is moi!


325
00:16:34.655 --> 00:16:37.867
Nighty-Knight:
No, Megamind gave me his darkest blessing.


326
00:16:37.909 --> 00:16:40.703
Raise your hand
if you also think


327
00:16:40.745 --> 00:16:42.497
Megamind left you in charge.

328
00:16:42.538 --> 00:16:43.831
Pierre Pressure:
I do!


329
00:16:43.873 --> 00:16:45.249
Ugh, seriously?!

330
00:16:45.291 --> 00:16:49.003
How many leaders think
we should pay Megamind a visit?


331
00:16:49.045 --> 00:16:50.505
Pierre:
I do!


332
00:16:50.546 --> 00:16:51.839
Fine. It's settled then.

333
00:16:51.881 --> 00:16:55.426
I agree. But, there is
just one little thing


334
00:16:55.468 --> 00:16:57.178
to take care of first.

335
00:16:58.679 --> 00:17:01.099
Guard:
Hey, Doomy Glooms! No scheming during lunch!


336
00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:03.976
This was a nice place
to lay low for a while,


337
00:17:04.018 --> 00:17:06.729
but we've got some
business to take care of.


338
00:17:06.771 --> 00:17:09.732
Nighty-Knight:
Hello darkness, my old friend.


339
00:17:11.818 --> 00:17:12.944
Ha!

340
00:17:13.194 --> 00:17:14.404
Whoa! Ah!

341
00:17:16.364 --> 00:17:18.241
I can't move!

342
00:17:20.785 --> 00:17:23.287
I think you'll have problems hitting ze alarm

343
00:17:23.329 --> 00:17:26.582
if you are trapped
in an invisible box.


344
00:17:26.624 --> 00:17:30.461
Help! I'm trapped
in an invisible box!


345
00:17:34.298 --> 00:17:35.925
Behemoth? Go gravel.

346
00:17:50.857 --> 00:17:52.817
Guard:
Oh, please don't hurt me!


347
00:17:52.859 --> 00:17:55.278
We'll show ourselves out.

348
00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:03.578
Megamind, here we come.

349
00:18:05.997 --> 00:18:09.042
Spokesman:
Ever feel like you're driving to the same job,


350
00:18:09.083 --> 00:18:10.376
drinking the same coffee,

351
00:18:10.418 --> 00:18:13.046
wearing the same outfit
almost every day?


352
00:18:13.087 --> 00:18:15.631
- Ugh. Yeah.
- Spokesman: Have you been wondering


353
00:18:15.673 --> 00:18:17.717
if there's more
you could be doing


354
00:18:17.759 --> 00:18:19.469
- to spice up your life?
- Yeah.


355
00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:21.012
Spokesman:
We have the answer.


356
00:18:21.054 --> 00:18:23.556
Have a Mr. Minion's Meat-sicle!

357
00:18:23.598 --> 00:18:25.725
Protein on the go!

358
00:18:25.767 --> 00:18:27.727
Okay, that really
under-delivered.


359
00:18:27.769 --> 00:18:29.270
Roxanne, I'm in great danger!

360
00:18:33.775 --> 00:18:35.777
How are you doing this?!

361
00:18:35.818 --> 00:18:38.738
Through the bobblehead of myself
I gave to you as a present.


362
00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:40.990
It's a tracking device
so I can look out for you.


363
00:18:41.032 --> 00:18:44.410
I'm flattered by this
invasion of my privacy.


364
00:18:44.452 --> 00:18:48.122
Come to the lair immediately.
My very life may depend on it!


365
00:18:48.706 --> 00:18:50.666
Hang on!
I'll be right there.


366
00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:02.387
Megamind?

367
00:19:02.887 --> 00:19:04.680
Megamind:
I'm in the kitchen! Hurry!


368
00:19:06.974 --> 00:19:10.686
- How dare you defy me, you--
- Roxanne: What is happening?


369
00:19:10.728 --> 00:19:12.563
I'll tell you what's happening!

370
00:19:12.605 --> 00:19:16.567
This disrespectful toaster
pastry refuses to toast!


371
00:19:16.609 --> 00:19:19.070
I thought this was
a matter of life and death!


372
00:19:19.112 --> 00:19:22.115
Newsflash! I need food,
or I'll starve.


373
00:19:22.156 --> 00:19:24.283
Besides, I couldn't
reach the pancakes.


374
00:19:25.701 --> 00:19:28.538
Newsflash!
Toasters need to be plugged in


375
00:19:28.579 --> 00:19:29.872
or they won't work.

376
00:19:29.914 --> 00:19:33.459
Show me what you did,
sorceress!


377
00:19:33.501 --> 00:19:36.713
Maybe you should call Chum?

378
00:19:36.754 --> 00:19:39.757
I'm fully capable of
taking care of myself.


379
00:19:39.799 --> 00:19:43.094
One question. How does one go
about taking care of oneself?


380
00:19:43.136 --> 00:19:45.388
The intruder alert!

381
00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:46.556
Thank goodness.

382
00:19:46.597 --> 00:19:48.850
- Isn't that bad?
- It's Chum.


383
00:19:48.891 --> 00:19:50.309
He's always setting that off.

384
00:19:50.351 --> 00:19:53.730
Looks like someone couldn't
bear to be without me.


385
00:19:56.065 --> 00:19:59.235
Well, well. Look who
finally decided to--


386
00:19:59.277 --> 00:20:01.988
- Ah!
- Lady Doppler: Come on, Megamind.


387
00:20:02.029 --> 00:20:04.657
Is that any way to
welcome your old crew?


388
00:20:05.158 --> 00:20:08.786
I mean...
what an unpleasant surprise!


389
00:20:08.828 --> 00:20:11.247
My old evil supervillain team.

390
00:20:11.289 --> 00:20:14.292
Nighty-Knight:
You must be so stoked to see us.


391
00:20:14.333 --> 00:20:17.795
Stoked doesn't begin to
describe it, Fright Night.


392
00:20:17.837 --> 00:20:22.383
Get zis. He now wants
to be called "Nighty-Knight."


393
00:20:22.425 --> 00:20:23.676
Nighty-Knight:
It's scarier!


394
00:20:23.718 --> 00:20:26.262
Oh, yes. I'm terrified.

395
00:20:26.304 --> 00:20:29.599
Nighty-Knight:
See? Megamind gets my darkness.


396
00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:32.477
- That's why he
left me in charge. -


397
00:20:32.518 --> 00:20:34.353
But that's not why we're here.

398
00:20:34.395 --> 00:20:36.689
We heard all about
your new job.


399
00:20:36.731 --> 00:20:38.274
You did?

400
00:20:38.316 --> 00:20:41.277
Nighty-Knight:
Yeah! You think we were gonna let that go


401
00:20:41.319 --> 00:20:43.279
without paying you a visit?

402
00:20:43.321 --> 00:20:46.115
Let him have it, Behemoth!

403
00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:51.412
Guys!
Can't we just talk this--


404
00:20:51.454 --> 00:20:52.663
Ah!

405
00:20:53.664 --> 00:20:56.626
The Doom Syndicate: Congratulations!

406
00:20:56.667 --> 00:20:57.710
What?

407
00:20:57.752 --> 00:20:58.878
* For he's a horrible *

408
00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:00.088
* Evil fellow *

409
00:21:00.129 --> 00:21:02.131
* Which nobody can deny *

410
00:21:02.173 --> 00:21:03.716
* Because he's now
their evil overlord *


411
00:21:03.758 --> 00:21:07.053
* And they're likely to receive
an unusually cruel punishment *


412
00:21:08.888 --> 00:21:13.101
Imagine, ze entire city
thinks you are a hero!


413
00:21:13.142 --> 00:21:16.187
When you said lay low in prison
and wait for your signal,


414
00:21:16.229 --> 00:21:19.482
we had no idea
it was gonna be this!


415
00:21:19.524 --> 00:21:23.194
- Not even I could
conjure such an illusion. -


416
00:21:23.236 --> 00:21:26.364
Nighty-Knight:
It's dark, it's messed up,


417
00:21:26.406 --> 00:21:28.366
and I love it.

418
00:21:28.408 --> 00:21:29.534
Huh?

419
00:21:29.575 --> 00:21:32.829
Oh yeah, that's the stuff.

420
00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:36.499
You think
I'm pretending to be a hero.


421
00:21:36.541 --> 00:21:38.334
- Nighty-Knight: Huh?
- Oh.


422
00:21:38.376 --> 00:21:41.170
And you'd be right, of course!

423
00:21:41.212 --> 00:21:44.132
That was absolutely
my intention.


424
00:21:44.173 --> 00:21:47.802
There no way Megamind
could be real hero.


425
00:21:47.844 --> 00:21:50.471
That would be great
betrayal and cause


426
00:21:50.513 --> 00:21:52.640
much anger in Behemoth!

427
00:21:54.642 --> 00:21:57.103
But you not, so Behemoth happy.

428
00:21:57.145 --> 00:21:59.522
- Oh...
- Where is Monsieur Minion?


429
00:21:59.564 --> 00:22:03.025
Ze robot poisson zat would keep
your place so span and spic-y.


430
00:22:03.067 --> 00:22:04.694
Oh, Chum!

431
00:22:04.736 --> 00:22:07.780
He's not here because, uh,

432
00:22:07.822 --> 00:22:09.240
corporate shake-up.

433
00:22:09.282 --> 00:22:11.701
Lots of internal changes.

434
00:22:13.536 --> 00:22:15.329
You know you're not
supposed to dry


435
00:22:15.371 --> 00:22:18.374
your metal spiked capes
in the microwave and--


436
00:22:18.416 --> 00:22:20.126
The Doom Syndicate!

437
00:22:20.168 --> 00:22:22.378
What's Roxanne Ritchi
doing here?!


438
00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:23.755
I assure you

439
00:22:23.796 --> 00:22:26.215
there's a completely evil
explanation for this.


440
00:22:27.675 --> 00:22:29.343
We're waiting.

441
00:22:29.385 --> 00:22:32.096
Yeah... so am I.

442
00:22:32.138 --> 00:22:35.850
Roxanne is here,
at this moment, right now,


443
00:22:35.892 --> 00:22:38.394
before us,
because she's agreed...


444
00:22:38.436 --> 00:22:39.645
Syndicate:
Yeah?


445
00:22:39.687 --> 00:22:43.191
- ...to be my evil bride.
- What?!


446
00:22:43.232 --> 00:22:45.026
They still think I'm evil

447
00:22:45.068 --> 00:22:46.778
and only pretending
to be a hero.


448
00:22:46.819 --> 00:22:49.030
- Play along!
- Is this true?


449
00:22:49.489 --> 00:22:52.909
More like too good to be true!

450
00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:55.161
I can't believe
you're with her!


451
00:22:55.203 --> 00:22:57.914
She got me fired from
my weather reporting job!


452
00:22:57.955 --> 00:22:59.707
You got yourself fired

453
00:22:59.749 --> 00:23:01.876
because you never
got a forecast right.


454
00:23:01.918 --> 00:23:03.086
Not to mention turning evil

455
00:23:03.127 --> 00:23:05.922
and throwing lightning
at everybody, Gail.


456
00:23:05.963 --> 00:23:08.341
It's Lady Doppler now.

457
00:23:08.383 --> 00:23:11.928
And you two together,
I don't buy it.


458
00:23:11.969 --> 00:23:15.181
Behemoth disagree.
Behemoth always see


459
00:23:15.223 --> 00:23:19.435
certain romantic tension between
blue man and pretty lady.


460
00:23:20.686 --> 00:23:21.979
- Really?
- Really?


461
00:23:22.021 --> 00:23:23.815
Opposites attract, no?

462
00:23:23.856 --> 00:23:26.442
Like crepes and marmalade.

463
00:23:26.901 --> 00:23:29.737
Can you guys excuse us?
Need a quick word in the kitchen


464
00:23:29.779 --> 00:23:32.156
with my not-so-better half.

465
00:23:33.282 --> 00:23:34.742
Ow!

466
00:23:34.784 --> 00:23:36.911
I'll have you know those have
a warm fruit-filled center


467
00:23:36.953 --> 00:23:38.788
that could have left me
horribly disfigured.


468
00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:40.915
Why didn't you
tell them the truth?


469
00:23:40.957 --> 00:23:44.043
Tell them I'm really a hero?
Are you crazy?


470
00:23:44.085 --> 00:23:46.295
There's four of them,
and only one of me!


471
00:23:46.337 --> 00:23:49.298
They'll pound me into
a blue pulp, Roxanne.


472
00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:51.384
They're going to
find out eventually.


473
00:23:51.426 --> 00:23:55.221
Oh, and since when were you
ever part of The Doom Syndicate?


474
00:23:55.722 --> 00:23:57.223
Uh...

475
00:23:57.432 --> 00:23:58.516
Uh...

476
00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:01.644
Founding member,
actually.


477
00:24:01.686 --> 00:24:03.271
I was cutting my evil teeth

478
00:24:03.312 --> 00:24:05.982
shortly after graduating
from Villain Shool.


479
00:24:06.023 --> 00:24:09.318
You went to a villain shool?
I mean, school.


480
00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:11.571
Really more of
a mentorship program.


481
00:24:11.612 --> 00:24:14.824
Unfortunately, my evil professor
and I had a falling out.


482
00:24:14.866 --> 00:24:17.368
He kind of went to pieces.
Literally.


483
00:24:17.410 --> 00:24:20.038
Always learning
new things about you.


484
00:24:20.079 --> 00:24:23.583
So, I recruited
the very best of the worst.


485
00:24:27.462 --> 00:24:30.423
With me as their handsome leader,

486
00:24:30.465 --> 00:24:34.469
- The Doom Syndicate was
the premier villain team. -


487
00:24:34.510 --> 00:24:37.305
Man, those were good times.

488
00:24:37.805 --> 00:24:40.099
I mean, they were bad times

489
00:24:40.141 --> 00:24:42.268
that were good when I was bad.

490
00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:44.437
But eventually, I realized

491
00:24:44.479 --> 00:24:46.814
I didn't like sharing
the spotlight.


492
00:24:46.856 --> 00:24:48.399
So, you ditched them?

493
00:24:48.441 --> 00:24:51.110
I told them I was
working on an evil project.


494
00:24:51.152 --> 00:24:54.030
And that I'd signal them
when I took over Metrocity,

495
00:24:54.072 --> 00:24:56.199
which they think I have.

496
00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:58.951
Until I can figure out
a way to stop them,


497
00:24:58.993 --> 00:25:01.704
we must keep up
evil appearances.


498
00:25:01.746 --> 00:25:04.207
No. No! No way!

499
00:25:04.248 --> 00:25:07.085
Come on, Roxanne. Please?

500
00:25:07.126 --> 00:25:08.211
No!

501
00:25:08.586 --> 00:25:10.421
Pleas--

502
00:25:10.463 --> 00:25:12.548
And we're back.

503
00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:15.426
So, you guys have any schemes?

504
00:25:15.468 --> 00:25:18.179
I mean,
plans while you're in town?


505
00:25:18.221 --> 00:25:19.972
Nighty
-Knight: No,

506
00:25:20.014 --> 00:25:22.767
but this guy does!

507
00:25:22.809 --> 00:25:24.977
I'm not following.

508
00:25:25.019 --> 00:25:27.355
Lady Doppler:
We're here for Phase Two, silly.


509
00:25:27.397 --> 00:25:29.690
Phase Two.

510
00:25:29.732 --> 00:25:31.067
What's a Phase Two?

511
00:25:31.109 --> 00:25:34.237
Guess your boyfriend
doesn't tell you everything.


512
00:25:34.278 --> 00:25:36.948
Megamind said when
he took over Metro City,


513
00:25:36.989 --> 00:25:38.908
we'd all have a place
in the next phase


514
00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:40.827
of his evil master plan.

515
00:25:40.868 --> 00:25:43.913
Phase Two is
such a genius plan.


516
00:25:43.955 --> 00:25:46.708
I cannot wait to get started!

517
00:25:47.166 --> 00:25:49.585
Yeah! That's actually
one of the reasons


518
00:25:49.627 --> 00:25:51.337
why I agreed to evil-marry him.

519
00:25:51.379 --> 00:25:53.423
I love a good Phase Two.

520
00:25:53.464 --> 00:25:55.967
But, remind me again
what this one is


521
00:25:56.008 --> 00:25:58.094
and what havoc it might wreak?

522
00:25:58.136 --> 00:26:00.221
Would you give us a moment?

523
00:26:00.263 --> 00:26:03.057
Relax. I never even bothered
to finish Phase Two.


524
00:26:03.099 --> 00:26:05.184
Lady Doppler: Let's roll!

525
00:26:05.226 --> 00:26:07.437
What's the mad rush, guys?

526
00:26:07.478 --> 00:26:08.896
You just got here!

527
00:26:08.938 --> 00:26:11.816
Let's have some fun before
jumping into evil business.


528
00:26:11.858 --> 00:26:13.443
Charades, anyone?

529
00:26:13.818 --> 00:26:15.903
I say we break
in Megamind's city


530
00:26:15.945 --> 00:26:18.114
with a good old-fashioned
crime spree.


531
00:26:18.156 --> 00:26:19.157
Syndicate:
Yeah!


532
00:26:19.198 --> 00:26:21.242
I don't know, guys.

533
00:26:21.284 --> 00:26:23.995
Aren't we all a little above
crime spree-ing at this point?


534
00:26:24.037 --> 00:26:25.621
Syndicate:
No!


535
00:26:25.663 --> 00:26:28.207
Nighty-Knight:
Look out, Metro City, here comes the darkness.


536
00:26:28.249 --> 00:26:31.294
- Lady Doppler: Let's do this!
- Pierre: Away we go!


537
00:26:31.335 --> 00:26:34.630
What a fun and totally
preventable situation


538
00:26:34.672 --> 00:26:35.882
you've created.

539
00:26:35.923 --> 00:26:37.383
Please tell me you have a plan.

540
00:26:37.425 --> 00:26:39.135
Oh, you better warn the mayor.

541
00:26:39.177 --> 00:26:41.262
Meanwhile, I'll try to keep
The Doom Syndicate


542
00:26:41.304 --> 00:26:43.139
from destroying the entire city
while thinking of a plan


543
00:26:43.181 --> 00:26:44.640
to keep them from doing
my other plan.


544
00:26:44.682 --> 00:26:46.684
Make sense?

545
00:26:46.726 --> 00:26:48.227
Yes, but only in the

546
00:26:48.269 --> 00:26:50.146
you're-the-one-saying-it
sort of way.


547
00:26:51.272 --> 00:26:54.025
You should know
I'm a people non-person.


548
00:26:54.067 --> 00:26:55.234
I'm a self-starter,

549
00:26:55.276 --> 00:26:57.070
but also enjoy
the collaborative process.


550
00:26:57.111 --> 00:26:59.072
I'm proficient in
robotics, neuroscience,


551
00:26:59.113 --> 00:27:00.990
chemical engineering,
death-ray construction,


552
00:27:01.032 --> 00:27:03.034
bioengineering,
and event planning.


553
00:27:03.076 --> 00:27:05.078
So, anything in those areas.

554
00:27:07.246 --> 00:27:09.665
I'm lookin' for
a toilet scrubber.


555
00:27:09.707 --> 00:27:11.000
That's perfect!

556
00:27:11.042 --> 00:27:13.044
Another item
off my bucket list!


557
00:27:13.086 --> 00:27:15.922
I won't let you down, New Sir.

558
00:27:18.716 --> 00:27:21.386
Whoa! Ah!

559
00:27:36.317 --> 00:27:39.445
Today's forecast:
frigid cold flurries,


560
00:27:39.487 --> 00:27:42.365
and a hundred percent
chance of doom!


561
00:27:46.869 --> 00:27:49.747
Nighty-Knight:
That's a thunderstorm, not a snowstorm.


562
00:27:49.789 --> 00:27:52.500
Whatever, Mr. Nappy
-Nap.

563
00:27:52.542 --> 00:27:55.253
Behemoth: Behemoth hungry!

564
00:27:58.756 --> 00:28:01.926
It is just an advertisement,
you silly rock monster!


565
00:28:01.968 --> 00:28:03.469
**

566
00:28:03.511 --> 00:28:04.554
Huh?

567
00:28:04.929 --> 00:28:08.808
Flat man trick Behemoth!

568
00:28:15.273 --> 00:28:16.899
Officer:
Freeze! Police!


569
00:28:20.778 --> 00:28:22.363
You're all under arrest!

570
00:28:22.405 --> 00:28:23.573
**

571
00:28:23.614 --> 00:28:25.116
Now, officers,

572
00:28:25.158 --> 00:28:27.994
wouldn't you rather
just arrest yourselves? -


573
00:28:28.911 --> 00:28:32.123
Officers:
I have the right to remain silent.


574
00:28:32.165 --> 00:28:35.585
Anything I say can
and will be used against me


575
00:28:35.626 --> 00:28:37.587
in the court of law.

576
00:28:37.628 --> 00:28:39.630
- I have the right to a...
- Au revoir!


577
00:28:39.672 --> 00:28:42.258
Sorry about all this, officers.
We'll have a good chuckle


578
00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:44.719
when you snap out of it
in a few hours.


579
00:28:45.219 --> 00:28:46.804
Nighty-Knight:
The darkness!


580
00:28:48.473 --> 00:28:49.932
The bedlam!

581
00:28:51.059 --> 00:28:52.310
The chaos!

582
00:28:52.351 --> 00:28:55.146
I feed on it.

583
00:28:55.980 --> 00:28:58.149
Huh?

584
00:29:05.323 --> 00:29:09.035
I will call you
Mr. Cuddly Snuggles.


585
00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:13.247
No one must know
of our friendship.


586
00:29:14.123 --> 00:29:16.042
Darkness!

587
00:29:18.586 --> 00:29:19.670
Brainbots, code:

588
00:29:19.712 --> 00:29:20.963
"Fix all the things
the bad guys broke


589
00:29:21.005 --> 00:29:23.883
so I'm not legally
or financially responsible."


590
00:29:34.685 --> 00:29:35.520
That handles that!

591
00:29:36.479 --> 00:29:39.649
Mayor:
For his ongoing heroic actions as Metro's defender,


592
00:29:39.690 --> 00:29:43.319
I award Megamind
the key to our fair city.


593
00:29:45.279 --> 00:29:46.906
If only
your adoring public knew


594
00:29:46.948 --> 00:29:49.325
what we had
in store for everyone! -


595
00:29:51.953 --> 00:29:54.163
Yeah, poor them!

596
00:29:55.998 --> 00:29:58.668
Keiko: Whoa!

597
00:29:58.710 --> 00:30:01.796
Those guys are no joke!

598
00:30:09.387 --> 00:30:12.056
- Whoa! Close one!
- You again?


599
00:30:12.473 --> 00:30:14.100
Megamind just
saved yours truly


600
00:30:14.142 --> 00:30:16.227
from becoming
a human vegan pancake!


601
00:30:16.269 --> 00:30:18.604
For more awesome saves,
click like and subscribe!


602
00:30:19.814 --> 00:30:22.024
Oh-ho, my followers
are gonna love that!


603
00:30:22.066 --> 00:30:23.651
And you're much faster
than you look.


604
00:30:23.693 --> 00:30:26.320
Maybe it's the boots.

605
00:30:29.657 --> 00:30:31.576
You're gonna stop
those guys, right?


606
00:30:31.617 --> 00:30:34.037
Eventually, but right now,
I'm deep undercover.


607
00:30:34.078 --> 00:30:35.371
They still think I'm a villain.

608
00:30:35.413 --> 00:30:37.123
Cool! So, you need my help.

609
00:30:37.165 --> 00:30:38.624
I'll take the volcano guy!

610
00:30:38.666 --> 00:30:40.460
- No, here's what
you need to do. - Whoa!


611
00:30:40.501 --> 00:30:43.796
Use your super-tween speed to
run on home and watch cartoons.


612
00:30:43.838 --> 00:30:46.591
I'm more useful than
you think, you know!


613
00:30:46.632 --> 00:30:47.800
Ugh!

614
00:30:49.510 --> 00:30:51.387
Lady Doppler:
Look at that.


615
00:30:51.429 --> 00:30:53.890
A bank just waiting
to be robbed.


616
00:30:53.931 --> 00:30:56.350
Let's see some of that
old Megamind magic.


617
00:30:56.392 --> 00:30:58.561
Uh, no thanks. I'm good.

618
00:30:58.603 --> 00:31:00.063
Huh?

619
00:31:00.104 --> 00:31:01.731
I mean, I'm... not good.

620
00:31:01.773 --> 00:31:04.734
It's just important to
keep up good appearances.


621
00:31:04.776 --> 00:31:07.153
Remember, they still
think I'm a hero.


622
00:31:07.195 --> 00:31:09.072
What is ze point, eh?

623
00:31:09.113 --> 00:31:11.074
Phase Deux is just
around the corner.


624
00:31:11.115 --> 00:31:13.576
Nighty-Knight:
Robbing banks was like a ray of dark


625
00:31:13.618 --> 00:31:15.828
in your already
pitch-black soul.


626
00:31:15.870 --> 00:31:18.748
Aw, come on! Please?

627
00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:20.917
Fine! I'll do it.

628
00:31:20.958 --> 00:31:23.795
Even though this sort of bad
is beneath me now.


629
00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:32.595
Bank Manager:
Look! It's Megamind! - Uh...


630
00:31:32.637 --> 00:31:35.306
The hero of Metro City!

631
00:31:35.348 --> 00:31:39.310
Oh no. Please! Your applause
really isn't necessary.


632
00:31:39.936 --> 00:31:43.064
Nighty-Knight:
I can't wait to see their faces when they realize


633
00:31:43.106 --> 00:31:45.316
evil Megamind is back.

634
00:31:45.358 --> 00:31:47.985
Their sorrow will be delicious.

635
00:31:48.027 --> 00:31:51.155
Their sorrow will be delicious.

636
00:31:51.197 --> 00:31:52.782
That's what you sound like.

637
00:31:53.366 --> 00:31:54.700
A few days ago,

638
00:31:54.742 --> 00:31:57.495
if you'd have come in,
I'd be hiding under my desk.


639
00:31:57.537 --> 00:32:01.124
Such a relief to know
you're on the good side now.


640
00:32:01.165 --> 00:32:03.251
**

641
00:32:03.292 --> 00:32:05.962
But no need to make a fuss.

642
00:32:06.003 --> 00:32:08.715
In fact, why don't you
all go back to treating me


643
00:32:08.756 --> 00:32:10.967
- like you did in
the bad old days. -


644
00:32:11.008 --> 00:32:13.469
But, that's when you were evil.

645
00:32:13.511 --> 00:32:15.179
You kept robbing us.

646
00:32:15.221 --> 00:32:17.640
That's not why
you're here, is it?


647
00:32:17.682 --> 00:32:20.101
I'm sorry.
I have to do this.


648
00:32:20.143 --> 00:32:21.602
B
-But why?

649
00:32:21.644 --> 00:32:25.189
Because it's, uh... it's, uh...

650
00:32:25.231 --> 00:32:27.316
- Keiko: It's a safety drill!
- Huh?


651
00:32:27.358 --> 00:32:29.777
For MegaWatch?
Half a million viewers?


652
00:32:29.819 --> 00:32:31.863
We're making this for the kids
at home so they know what to do


653
00:32:31.904 --> 00:32:34.949
in case a real villain
comes into the bank.


654
00:32:34.991 --> 00:32:36.701
Right, Megamind?

655
00:32:37.368 --> 00:32:38.911
Yes?

656
00:32:38.953 --> 00:32:40.163
I mean, yes!

657
00:32:40.204 --> 00:32:43.499
So, let's just pretend
it's like the old days.


658
00:32:43.541 --> 00:32:44.876
It'll be fun! Everyone,

659
00:32:44.917 --> 00:32:47.170
let's get those hands
in the air.


660
00:32:47.211 --> 00:32:48.838
Come on, get 'em up!

661
00:32:51.883 --> 00:32:53.176
Oh, I get it!

662
00:32:53.217 --> 00:32:54.594
Did I just save your butt?

663
00:32:54.635 --> 00:32:56.387
- Feels like I just
saved your butt. - Huh?


664
00:32:56.429 --> 00:32:58.347
Just need a quick pic
of the exact moment


665
00:32:58.389 --> 00:33:00.141
you realized you need me.

666
00:33:02.894 --> 00:33:05.188
I guess he is still
a master villain.


667
00:33:05.229 --> 00:33:07.482
Not only is
he robbing ze place,


668
00:33:07.523 --> 00:33:09.275
he's stopping for selfies!

669
00:33:09.317 --> 00:33:11.736
- Nighty-Knight: He hasn't lost
a dark and twisted step. -


670
00:33:11.778 --> 00:33:15.031
I still think
something's off about him.


671
00:33:15.073 --> 00:33:17.075
You are just jealous.

672
00:33:17.116 --> 00:33:18.701
Ze man is a genius!

673
00:33:18.743 --> 00:33:20.787
After all,
he left me in charge.


674
00:33:20.828 --> 00:33:23.915
Nighty-Knight:
What are you talking about? He put me in charge.


675
00:33:23.956 --> 00:33:28.711
He told Behemoth leader
should go by height and girth.


676
00:33:28.753 --> 00:33:31.214
Megamind:
Stay back!


677
00:33:31.255 --> 00:33:32.507
Stay back, I say!

678
00:33:32.548 --> 00:33:33.925
It certainly was good

679
00:33:33.966 --> 00:33:36.386
to work those old
bank-robbing muscles again.


680
00:33:36.427 --> 00:33:38.930
Okay, we need you
to settle something.


681
00:33:38.971 --> 00:33:41.432
Who did you leave in charge
of The Doom Syndicate?


682
00:33:41.474 --> 00:33:43.476
Uh, isn't it obvious?

683
00:33:43.518 --> 00:33:47.313
I chose the evilest
and most qualified candidate.


684
00:33:47.355 --> 00:33:48.940
All:
Thank you!


685
00:33:48.981 --> 00:33:51.025
- Wait?
- Huh?


686
00:33:51.484 --> 00:33:53.486
Mayor:
I'm getting calls from all over!


687
00:33:53.528 --> 00:33:55.405
People are saying
Megamind's running amok


688
00:33:55.446 --> 00:33:57.240
with a group of
villains out there!


689
00:33:57.281 --> 00:34:00.368
He's buying us time until he can
figure out a way to stop them.


690
00:34:00.410 --> 00:34:01.869
Mr. Mayor,
we have to trust him.


691
00:34:01.911 --> 00:34:04.414
We're still cleaning up
after the last time


692
00:34:04.455 --> 00:34:07.333
Megamind "saved" the city.

693
00:34:07.375 --> 00:34:09.293
I don't know what to do!

694
00:34:09.335 --> 00:34:12.588
Nobody told me mayor-ing
would be so hard!


695
00:34:12.630 --> 00:34:16.259
And I can't open
my tummy medicine!


696
00:34:17.802 --> 00:34:20.680
Thank you, Christina.

697
00:34:20.722 --> 00:34:24.142
Far be it from me to presume to
tell you what to do, Mr. Mayor.


698
00:34:24.183 --> 00:34:27.562
No, no, please! Presume away.
I-I got nothing!


699
00:34:27.603 --> 00:34:29.981
Well, first, you need
to notify law enforcement


700
00:34:30.022 --> 00:34:32.984
to pull back until Megamind
can figure out what to do.


701
00:34:33.025 --> 00:34:35.611
Then, get ahold of emergency
services and have them stand by


702
00:34:35.653 --> 00:34:39.073
- just in case things go wrong.
- Right. Got it.


703
00:34:40.658 --> 00:34:42.744
What did you say after, "first"?

704
00:34:42.785 --> 00:34:45.788
**

705
00:34:45.830 --> 00:34:49.000
Oh, you wouldn't
believe the day I had.


706
00:34:49.584 --> 00:34:52.754
They wouldn't
understand the new me.


707
00:34:52.795 --> 00:34:54.797
Not like you did, Chum.

708
00:34:55.882 --> 00:34:58.509
But I guess that's
all in the past.


709
00:34:58.551 --> 00:35:01.054
I'm defender of Metrocity now,

710
00:35:01.095 --> 00:35:05.308
and I need to learn to handle
these things on my own.


711
00:35:05.850 --> 00:35:09.437
But how do I take down
four villains at once?


712
00:35:09.479 --> 00:35:12.023
Maybe I just need
to sleep on this.


713
00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:18.905
Ah!

714
00:35:18.946 --> 00:35:21.407
What is that infernal racket?

715
00:35:28.956 --> 00:35:30.708
Woo!

716
00:35:36.506 --> 00:35:38.508
What in the name of
King Tut's cat collection


717
00:35:38.549 --> 00:35:39.801
is going on here?!

718
00:35:39.842 --> 00:35:42.095
Since we're launching
Phase Two tomorrow,


719
00:35:42.136 --> 00:35:46.015
we decided to throw
a Metro City's going-away party.


720
00:35:46.057 --> 00:35:48.434
I didn't agree
to that timeline.


721
00:35:48.476 --> 00:35:50.520
And where did all
these people come from?


722
00:35:50.561 --> 00:35:52.063
Knighty-Night:
Don't worry.


723
00:35:52.105 --> 00:35:54.023
They're all dark
and dangerous criminals.


724
00:35:56.484 --> 00:35:59.695
- Ollo?
- Roxanne : I bought some time with the mayor.


725
00:35:59.737 --> 00:36:01.030
What's all that ruckus?

726
00:36:01.072 --> 00:36:03.574
I'm the victim of
an impromptu rager.


727
00:36:04.659 --> 00:36:05.743
Just a second, Roxanne.

728
00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:08.996
Sir, I'll have you know
that is my special chair!


729
00:36:09.038 --> 00:36:12.375
Off now!
Why aren't you using a coaster?


730
00:36:12.417 --> 00:36:14.627
I want everybody out of here!

731
00:36:14.669 --> 00:36:16.879
Ah, don't be
ze pooper of parties.


732
00:36:16.921 --> 00:36:19.215
Besides, we texted
some old friends


733
00:36:19.257 --> 00:36:20.508
who just broke outta prison.

734
00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:22.301
They should be here any minute!

735
00:36:22.343 --> 00:36:24.178
Old friends?

736
00:36:25.388 --> 00:36:26.681
Oh no!

737
00:36:26.723 --> 00:36:28.850
The Go Fish Gang
just walked in.


738
00:36:28.891 --> 00:36:30.893
If they tell the Syndicate
I'm really a hero


739
00:36:30.935 --> 00:36:33.146
and not a villain
pretending to be a hero,


740
00:36:33.187 --> 00:36:35.356
this could get ugly quick.

741
00:36:35.398 --> 00:36:37.150
There he is!

742
00:36:37.191 --> 00:36:38.401
Gotta go!

743
00:36:38.443 --> 00:36:40.236
Attention, everyone!

744
00:36:40.278 --> 00:36:41.696
I said attention!

745
00:36:43.448 --> 00:36:46.868
There's something you all
should know about your host.


746
00:36:47.994 --> 00:36:49.871
Brainbot, lay down a sick beat.

747
00:36:49.912 --> 00:36:51.581
- Big King Fish:
The truth about Megamind-- - Huh?


748
00:36:51.622 --> 00:36:52.623
Hey!

749
00:36:52.665 --> 00:36:54.250
Hey! What the--

750
00:36:54.292 --> 00:36:56.586
- Wish I didn't have
to resort to this. -


751
00:36:56.627 --> 00:36:58.755
**

752
00:37:04.302 --> 00:37:07.722
Uh, hold on! Y-You all
should know Megamind--


753
00:37:07.764 --> 00:37:09.807
Has had no formal
dance training!


754
00:37:11.225 --> 00:37:14.687
DJ, put another stanky
groove in my pocket.


755
00:37:19.317 --> 00:37:20.818
I'll take Megamind.

756
00:37:20.860 --> 00:37:23.863
You two get to that
microphone and warn everybody.


757
00:37:23.905 --> 00:37:26.491
- Blue Mackerel: Hey, look out!
- Red Snapper: Outta my way!


758
00:37:26.532 --> 00:37:28.785
**

759
00:37:33.581 --> 00:37:34.665
Ah!

760
00:37:34.707 --> 00:37:36.709
Hey! We've got
a dance-off over here!


761
00:37:43.466 --> 00:37:45.426
Stand still!

762
00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:01.943
Ooh! Ooh!

763
00:38:03.361 --> 00:38:06.614
Ah! Just... Gimme... One...

764
00:38:08.533 --> 00:38:10.785
**

765
00:38:11.536 --> 00:38:14.330
Get back here!

766
00:38:14.372 --> 00:38:16.958
Where'd he go?

767
00:38:20.586 --> 00:38:22.213
What the...?

768
00:38:32.807 --> 00:38:35.727
How many capes
can one guy have?


769
00:38:35.768 --> 00:38:36.894
Aha!

770
00:38:39.063 --> 00:38:42.483
4,987, but who's counting?

771
00:38:44.277 --> 00:38:45.486
One down, two to go.

772
00:38:52.493 --> 00:38:53.536
Aha!

773
00:38:55.580 --> 00:38:56.664
Oh!

774
00:39:02.670 --> 00:39:04.881
Oh no!

775
00:39:06.966 --> 00:39:09.552
Uh, don't mind me!
Just dropped a little plutonium!


776
00:39:11.137 --> 00:39:13.264
Blast you,
Newton's Laws of Motion!


777
00:39:17.310 --> 00:39:18.311
Gimme!

778
00:39:18.352 --> 00:39:21.230
Hey!
You have dislodged my beverage!


779
00:39:21.272 --> 00:39:24.901
Oh, um, sorry, Pierre,
but that ice cube's gone bad.


780
00:39:26.194 --> 00:39:27.236
Whoa!

781
00:39:37.372 --> 00:39:39.540
Order up.

782
00:39:40.875 --> 00:39:43.252
Hoo! That was a battle!

783
00:39:43.294 --> 00:39:46.089
But I was once again
victorious, New Sir.


784
00:39:46.130 --> 00:39:48.549
By the way, do you have
a few seconds to discuss


785
00:39:48.591 --> 00:39:50.385
some life-altering changes?

786
00:39:52.053 --> 00:39:55.014
Okay, I'll take your
simmering silence as a yes.


787
00:39:55.056 --> 00:39:58.476
Firstly, my keen eye for detail
has noticed that we only get


788
00:39:58.518 --> 00:40:00.019
two customers every day,

789
00:40:00.061 --> 00:40:02.772
Eccentric Eddie and his
pet cockroach Thaddeus.


790
00:40:03.856 --> 00:40:06.275
But what if we had
more customers?


791
00:40:06.317 --> 00:40:07.944
Now, I know what
you're gonna say.


792
00:40:07.985 --> 00:40:10.822
"Chum, how can I increase my cash flow

793
00:40:10.863 --> 00:40:12.990
in this treacherous economy?"

794
00:40:13.032 --> 00:40:15.451
Well, while I was
in my office just now,

795
00:40:15.493 --> 00:40:17.078
I came up with a few ideas.

796
00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:20.623
First, I'd recommend giving
the place a good scrubbing.


797
00:40:20.665 --> 00:40:23.167
Latest market research shows
people generally don't like


798
00:40:23.209 --> 00:40:25.920
sticking to chairs.
Second, let's face it.


799
00:40:25.962 --> 00:40:29.215
The kitchen staff is
horrendous, New Sir.


800
00:40:29.632 --> 00:40:32.260
- I am the kitchen staff.
- Chum: Oh!


801
00:40:33.928 --> 00:40:35.763
Which is a complete
and utter waste.


802
00:40:35.805 --> 00:40:37.473
With your radiant personality,

803
00:40:37.515 --> 00:40:39.892
you should be out here,
with the customers!


804
00:40:39.934 --> 00:40:42.353
And the fully automated
cooking system I've designed


805
00:40:42.395 --> 00:40:45.690
will allow you to fill this
place with your unique brand


806
00:40:45.732 --> 00:40:48.443
of customer service sunshine.

807
00:40:48.484 --> 00:40:49.694
And finally,

808
00:40:49.736 --> 00:40:51.904
I propose a menu change.

809
00:40:51.946 --> 00:40:54.073
We need to specialize!

810
00:40:54.115 --> 00:40:57.243
And what's the one food
everybody loves?


811
00:40:57.285 --> 00:40:58.619
Donuts!

812
00:41:00.788 --> 00:41:02.665
Say the word,
and I'll get started.


813
00:41:02.707 --> 00:41:03.916
Mm!

814
00:41:03.958 --> 00:41:06.586
You won't regret this, New Sir.

815
00:41:13.926 --> 00:41:15.720
Megamind?

816
00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:18.931
Ah! What's going on?

817
00:41:18.973 --> 00:41:22.185
This place is a wreck.
Was there some kind of battle?


818
00:41:22.226 --> 00:41:24.187
Just a dance one!

819
00:41:24.228 --> 00:41:27.565
Can you turn off
the music, please?!


820
00:41:27.607 --> 00:41:28.941
What music?

821
00:41:28.983 --> 00:41:31.527
Oh, that can't be good.

822
00:41:31.569 --> 00:41:33.196
Did you make muffins?

823
00:41:33.237 --> 00:41:35.198
Yeah, I'm trying new things.

824
00:41:35.239 --> 00:41:36.699
**

825
00:41:38.409 --> 00:41:40.995
Why are you mad
at my taste buds?!


826
00:41:41.037 --> 00:41:43.331
I said I was
"trying" new things.


827
00:41:43.373 --> 00:41:46.209
Ugh, maybe I should use
these on The Doom Syndicate.


828
00:41:46.250 --> 00:41:48.044
Still don't have a plan, huh?

829
00:41:48.086 --> 00:41:50.213
Have you tried just
telling them to leave?


830
00:41:50.254 --> 00:41:52.340
If I tell them to leave,
they'll ask why.


831
00:41:52.382 --> 00:41:54.384
And if I tell them why,
they'll get mad.


832
00:41:54.425 --> 00:41:56.803
And when villains get mad,
they break things.


833
00:41:56.844 --> 00:41:58.554
And the first thing
they'll break is me.


834
00:41:58.596 --> 00:42:01.974
And me is one of my favorite
things in the whole wide world!


835
00:42:02.016 --> 00:42:03.393
Yeah, well, we have to
think of something


836
00:42:03.434 --> 00:42:06.145
before they do whatever
this Phase Two thing is.


837
00:42:06.187 --> 00:42:08.398
The problem is
they're always together.


838
00:42:08.439 --> 00:42:11.776
I have to find a way to
take them all out at once.


839
00:42:11.818 --> 00:42:14.404
Behemoth:
Last night rocked!


840
00:42:14.445 --> 00:42:16.948
Roxanne's back. Yippee.

841
00:42:16.989 --> 00:42:19.575
Nighty-Knight:
Alright. Muffins!


842
00:42:19.617 --> 00:42:21.702
Well, now that we've celebrated--

843
00:42:21.744 --> 00:42:24.580
Nighty
-Knight: Oh, that's nasty.

844
00:42:24.622 --> 00:42:27.041
Now that we've celebrated
Megamind's triumph,


845
00:42:27.083 --> 00:42:29.419
surely it's time for Phase Two.

846
00:42:29.460 --> 00:42:31.504
Again, my evil hubby

847
00:42:31.546 --> 00:42:34.966
has so many amazing phases,
I get confused.


848
00:42:35.299 --> 00:42:39.137
- What exactly is Phase Two?
- Okay.


849
00:42:39.178 --> 00:42:42.306
Phase Two is
an ingenious plan I had


850
00:42:42.348 --> 00:42:44.434
to launch Metrocity
to the moon.


851
00:42:44.475 --> 00:42:47.478
You're joking, right?
How would that even work?


852
00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:50.565
Simple evil genius physics,
really.


853
00:42:53.901 --> 00:42:55.987
An energy force field
would entrap air


854
00:42:56.028 --> 00:42:57.739
and protect the populace
from G forces


855
00:42:57.780 --> 00:43:01.451
as rockets built beneath
the city would carry it up to


856
00:43:01.492 --> 00:43:04.245
and safely land on the moon.

857
00:43:07.457 --> 00:43:09.876
Syndicate:
Phase Two! Phase Two!


858
00:43:09.917 --> 00:43:12.587
Phase Two! Phase Two!

859
00:43:14.881 --> 00:43:16.883
There, we would establish
an entire planet


860
00:43:16.924 --> 00:43:18.926
devoted to evil-kind.

861
00:43:18.968 --> 00:43:20.636
Nighty-Knight:
Yeah, imagine.


862
00:43:20.678 --> 00:43:23.139
All of us living together,

863
00:43:23.181 --> 00:43:26.184
always for eternity.
Forever.


864
00:43:26.225 --> 00:43:28.895
Until the last star
falls from the heavens


865
00:43:28.936 --> 00:43:31.314
and beyond that.
Together.


866
00:43:31.355 --> 00:43:32.857
All of us.

867
00:43:32.899 --> 00:43:35.234
Just me and my evil friends,

868
00:43:35.276 --> 00:43:37.987
living in infinite darkness.

869
00:43:39.197 --> 00:43:41.365
Why do you have a teddy bear?

870
00:43:41.407 --> 00:43:44.494
Nighty-Knight: Give me back
Mr. Cuddly Snuggles!


871
00:43:44.535 --> 00:43:45.995
There, there.

872
00:43:46.037 --> 00:43:47.580
It's gonna be okay.

873
00:43:47.622 --> 00:43:50.458
Zee? Zis is why no one
thinks you are scary.


874
00:43:50.500 --> 00:43:53.252
Nighty-Knight:
Teddy bears aren't scary? Yeah.


875
00:43:53.294 --> 00:43:55.880
They only eat hikers, idiot!

876
00:43:58.091 --> 00:43:59.967
Getting back to
this plan of yours,


877
00:44:00.009 --> 00:44:02.678
just curious because
I am super into it.


878
00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:04.055
How would that even work?

879
00:44:04.097 --> 00:44:06.849
Just building the giant
rockets under the city


880
00:44:06.891 --> 00:44:08.518
would take years.

881
00:44:11.062 --> 00:44:12.772
Megamind:
Actually, it took six months.


882
00:44:12.814 --> 00:44:14.190
Construction moves pretty fast

883
00:44:14.232 --> 00:44:16.234
when you don't have to worry
about silly permits


884
00:44:16.275 --> 00:44:17.485
and union lunch breaks.

885
00:44:17.527 --> 00:44:20.113
One of the advantages
of being evil, I guess.


886
00:44:20.154 --> 00:44:21.739
Excuse us, guys.

887
00:44:23.116 --> 00:44:25.243
I thought you said you
never finished Phase Two.


888
00:44:25.284 --> 00:44:27.537
Still needs a couple
of coats of paint.


889
00:44:27.578 --> 00:44:30.415
Also, never totally
satisfied with the decor.


890
00:44:30.456 --> 00:44:32.667
Let's get in there
and launch those suckers.


891
00:44:32.709 --> 00:44:35.545
Syndicate:
Yeah!


892
00:44:35.586 --> 00:44:38.715
Uh, yeah. That'd be
in the launch room.


893
00:44:39.924 --> 00:44:42.051
Computer:
Password error. Access denied.


894
00:44:42.093 --> 00:44:45.096
Oh no,
I've forgotten the password!


895
00:44:45.138 --> 00:44:48.141
- Okay, plan's foiled.
Time to go! - Hold it!


896
00:44:48.182 --> 00:44:50.143
You forgot the password?

897
00:44:50.184 --> 00:44:51.477
Thought it was my birthday.

898
00:44:51.519 --> 00:44:53.604
Guess not. That's so like me!

899
00:44:53.646 --> 00:44:54.939
Can we go now?

900
00:44:54.981 --> 00:44:57.275
Actually, it's not like you.

901
00:44:57.316 --> 00:44:59.235
See? This is what
I'm talking about.


902
00:44:59.277 --> 00:45:02.113
He's been acting out of
character since we got here.


903
00:45:06.117 --> 00:45:09.370
How dare you imply
I have character.


904
00:45:09.412 --> 00:45:11.622
And who said you could
use my favorite mug?


905
00:45:11.664 --> 00:45:13.166
**

906
00:45:13.207 --> 00:45:15.418
Don't forget,
we've been waiting a long time


907
00:45:15.460 --> 00:45:17.545
for your plan here
to come to fruition.


908
00:45:17.587 --> 00:45:20.131
I don't think you wanna
disappoint your old friends.


909
00:45:20.173 --> 00:45:22.925
Yes, ominous warning noted.

910
00:45:22.967 --> 00:45:24.594
How's this for ominous?

911
00:45:24.635 --> 00:45:27.180
Either we launch
by the end of the day,


912
00:45:27.221 --> 00:45:29.348
or we level the city.

913
00:45:29.390 --> 00:45:30.600
Got it?

914
00:45:31.976 --> 00:45:34.604
Did you really
forget the password?


915
00:45:34.645 --> 00:45:35.480
Of course not.

916
00:45:35.521 --> 00:45:38.274
The password is THX8675309.

917
00:45:38.316 --> 00:45:40.109
It'd take an idiot
to forget that.


918
00:45:40.151 --> 00:45:41.611
We can't let them
launch the city,


919
00:45:41.652 --> 00:45:43.362
and we can't let them
destroy it.


920
00:45:43.404 --> 00:45:45.031
You have to do something.

921
00:45:45.073 --> 00:45:46.991
Yes, I've been wracking
my brilliant mind


922
00:45:47.033 --> 00:45:48.409
to come up with a plan.

923
00:45:48.451 --> 00:45:50.119
Titan was just one villain.

924
00:45:50.161 --> 00:45:52.872
This is a whole
syndicate of them.


925
00:45:52.914 --> 00:45:54.290
I can't beat them alone,
Roxanne.


926
00:45:54.332 --> 00:45:57.377
You don't have to.
You have me, and you have Chum.


927
00:45:57.418 --> 00:46:00.630
You just need to be willing
to ask for his help.


928
00:46:00.671 --> 00:46:02.465
Oh, I should have
never let him go.


929
00:46:02.507 --> 00:46:04.926
He's been by my side
through bad and good,


930
00:46:04.967 --> 00:46:06.928
never once asking me
for anything.


931
00:46:06.969 --> 00:46:08.471
Except for the parakeet.

932
00:46:08.513 --> 00:46:11.140
But again, they're
poop machines, Roxanne.


933
00:46:11.182 --> 00:46:12.892
Stay on topic.

934
00:46:12.934 --> 00:46:14.477
You're right.

935
00:46:14.519 --> 00:46:17.313
I need to let Chum
know I appreciate him,


936
00:46:17.355 --> 00:46:20.316
not just as a colleague,
but as a friend.


937
00:46:25.196 --> 00:46:27.031
Roxanne:
Chum's working here now?


938
00:46:27.281 --> 00:46:29.826
They called me
for a reference.


939
00:46:29.867 --> 00:46:31.160
Used to be a diner,

940
00:46:31.202 --> 00:46:32.787
but I don't remember
it being so popular.


941
00:46:32.829 --> 00:46:35.456
Just with the health department.
And cockroaches.


942
00:46:35.498 --> 00:46:37.333
Vile creatures!

943
00:46:37.375 --> 00:46:39.877
I despise them more than
button-down collars.


944
00:46:39.919 --> 00:46:44.340
Okay... guess I know what not
to get you for your birthday.


945
00:46:45.717 --> 00:46:46.676
Uh, excuse us?

946
00:46:46.718 --> 00:46:49.512
I'll try my best.
Name, please?


947
00:46:49.554 --> 00:46:52.932
Uh, Megamind,
defender of Metrocity.


948
00:46:52.974 --> 00:46:54.392
I'm kind of a big deal.

949
00:46:54.434 --> 00:46:57.186
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Deal.

950
00:46:57.228 --> 00:46:59.188
Your name's not on
the reservation list.


951
00:46:59.230 --> 00:47:01.357
Reservations? For donuts?

952
00:47:01.399 --> 00:47:04.152
We're not here to eat.
There's an emergency.


953
00:47:04.193 --> 00:47:06.821
Let me guess.
A fashion one?


954
00:47:06.863 --> 00:47:08.156
Excuse me?

955
00:47:08.197 --> 00:47:09.615
Ma'am, you give me no choice

956
00:47:09.657 --> 00:47:12.034
but to assert my
dominance upon you.


957
00:47:17.081 --> 00:47:18.791
Roxanne, it's no use.

958
00:47:18.833 --> 00:47:21.461
Clearly, this hostess is
trained in Krav Magoo.


959
00:47:21.502 --> 00:47:23.212
You guys having
a little trouble?


960
00:47:23.254 --> 00:47:24.881
How are you always around?!

961
00:47:24.922 --> 00:47:27.800
Us girls gotta have our
secrets, am I right?


962
00:47:27.842 --> 00:47:30.970
Seriously, dunno how you guys
survived this long without me.


963
00:47:31.012 --> 00:47:32.680
Think you can do better?

964
00:47:33.931 --> 00:47:36.893
Keiko Morita, MegaWatch.
You could let my friend in


965
00:47:36.934 --> 00:47:39.562
or I could post a scathing
review to my many followers


966
00:47:39.604 --> 00:47:42.231
mentioning the restaurant's
cockroach infestation.


967
00:47:42.273 --> 00:47:46.319
- Nice try, but we don't have
a cockroach infestation. -


968
00:47:48.112 --> 00:47:49.614
Ew! She's touching it!

969
00:47:49.655 --> 00:47:52.658
Keiko's hand modeling career
is over before it even started!


970
00:47:52.700 --> 00:47:55.411
He's harmless.
Just needed the distraction.


971
00:47:55.453 --> 00:47:57.872
- Thanks, Eccentric Eddie.
- I owe you one. -


972
00:47:57.914 --> 00:47:59.665
Don't mention it, kid!

973
00:47:59.707 --> 00:48:02.752
I remember when this place
used to be cool.


974
00:48:02.794 --> 00:48:04.003
**

975
00:48:04.045 --> 00:48:05.630
I don't approve
of your methods,


976
00:48:05.671 --> 00:48:07.507
but you're starting
to grow on me.


977
00:48:07.548 --> 00:48:09.717
Like a pleasant fungus.

978
00:48:11.260 --> 00:48:12.762
Wow.

979
00:48:12.804 --> 00:48:15.598
They've really
cleaned this place up!


980
00:48:16.933 --> 00:48:18.309
Chum:
Then he said,


981
00:48:18.351 --> 00:48:21.270
"Crime, it's a hard
halibut to break!"


982
00:48:23.314 --> 00:48:24.816
Previous Sir?

983
00:48:29.320 --> 00:48:30.822
What are you doing here?

984
00:48:30.863 --> 00:48:33.491
Oh, Chum.
What are the odds?


985
00:48:33.533 --> 00:48:36.828
Us running into each other
at my favorite eatery...


986
00:48:36.869 --> 00:48:40.331
that I've just walked into
for the first time.


987
00:48:41.874 --> 00:48:44.877
But, I'm not really
here for donuts.


988
00:48:44.919 --> 00:48:46.546
Oh, but do try one, sir.

989
00:48:48.005 --> 00:48:49.674
Chum, I came here to--

990
00:48:49.716 --> 00:48:52.969
Oh, my stars! It's like
a jamboree in my mouth!


991
00:48:53.219 --> 00:48:54.303
Mm.

992
00:48:54.345 --> 00:48:56.597
But, I came here to
tell you something


993
00:48:56.639 --> 00:48:59.475
that's not easy for me to say.

994
00:48:59.517 --> 00:49:03.104
I want you to know
I've always really appreciated--


995
00:49:03.146 --> 00:49:04.814
New Sir:
Chum, good buddy!


996
00:49:04.856 --> 00:49:06.149
Oh, uh, New Sir,

997
00:49:06.190 --> 00:49:09.068
this is my old boss,
Previous Sir.


998
00:49:09.110 --> 00:49:10.820
Pleasure to meet you.

999
00:49:10.862 --> 00:49:12.655
I go by Mr. Donut now.

1000
00:49:12.697 --> 00:49:14.574
It was Chum's idea,
and he's told me


1001
00:49:14.615 --> 00:49:16.826
some pretty great things
about you!


1002
00:49:16.868 --> 00:49:18.786
Guilty as charged.

1003
00:49:18.828 --> 00:49:21.664
Though a few were
just indictments. Wow.


1004
00:49:21.706 --> 00:49:25.168
It looks like he's getting
along rather well without me.


1005
00:49:25.209 --> 00:49:28.129
Chum is a dream come true!

1006
00:49:28.171 --> 00:49:30.882
Business is booming!
Check this out!


1007
00:49:30.923 --> 00:49:32.133
**

1008
00:49:32.175 --> 00:49:35.011
Not only has he fully
automated the kitchen...


1009
00:49:37.263 --> 00:49:41.434
...but he also came up with
the recipe for my secret glaze.


1010
00:49:41.476 --> 00:49:42.894
Mm!

1011
00:49:44.103 --> 00:49:45.396
Listen to me, kid,

1012
00:49:45.438 --> 00:49:47.482
I know I was a bit of
a grouch when you started.


1013
00:49:47.523 --> 00:49:49.817
You? New Sir, no!

1014
00:49:49.859 --> 00:49:52.111
No, no, no, it's true.
But I want you to know,


1015
00:49:52.153 --> 00:49:55.865
I appreciate everything you've
done for me as a colleague.


1016
00:49:55.907 --> 00:49:58.743
But more importantly,
as a friend.


1017
00:50:01.204 --> 00:50:03.247
- Oh. Uh...
- Mr. Donut: So,


1018
00:50:03.289 --> 00:50:05.333
I got you somethin'.

1019
00:50:05.375 --> 00:50:07.543
Your filthy unwashed apron?

1020
00:50:07.585 --> 00:50:08.878
But you cherish this!

1021
00:50:08.920 --> 00:50:12.715
And now, it's your
filthy unwashed apron.


1022
00:50:13.257 --> 00:50:14.675
Wow!

1023
00:50:20.723 --> 00:50:23.184
You were about to tell me
something, Previous Sir?


1024
00:50:23.226 --> 00:50:26.479
Yes.
I wanted you to know...


1025
00:50:28.189 --> 00:50:29.941
that I'm too late.

1026
00:50:29.982 --> 00:50:32.819
It's clear this is
where you belong now.


1027
00:50:32.860 --> 00:50:36.072
Just know letting you go
is the biggest regret


1028
00:50:36.114 --> 00:50:38.533
of my soon-to-be short life.

1029
00:50:38.574 --> 00:50:40.827
Previous Sir, are you
in some kind of trouble?


1030
00:50:41.452 --> 00:50:43.788
It's not your concern anymore.

1031
00:50:43.830 --> 00:50:48.292
Besides, it's nothing
I can't not handle on my own.


1032
00:50:48.334 --> 00:50:50.586
Goodbye, old friend.

1033
00:50:52.213 --> 00:50:54.132
Just do me one favor.

1034
00:50:55.133 --> 00:50:57.385
Be happy.

1035
00:51:05.101 --> 00:51:06.519
Where's Chum?

1036
00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:09.939
He's where
he truly belongs now.


1037
00:51:11.899 --> 00:51:14.569
I can't put
this off any longer.


1038
00:51:14.610 --> 00:51:16.446
I have to stop
The Doom Syndicate myself.


1039
00:51:16.487 --> 00:51:20.241
Even if it most certainly
leads to my demise.


1040
00:51:20.283 --> 00:51:21.492
Car.

1041
00:51:21.826 --> 00:51:23.786
What are you gonna do?

1042
00:51:23.828 --> 00:51:26.914
Hopefully come up
with a really good idea.


1043
00:51:26.956 --> 00:51:30.752
- That's all I got.
- Listen, you don't have to do this alone.


1044
00:51:30.793 --> 00:51:33.796
I'm the defender of
Metrocity, Roxanne.


1045
00:51:33.838 --> 00:51:36.549
If I don't look out for
this place, who will?


1046
00:51:38.843 --> 00:51:41.304
But, who's gonna
look out for him?


1047
00:51:43.848 --> 00:51:45.933
Announcer:
Welcome to Season 27


1048
00:51:45.975 --> 00:51:50.813
of "Crab Cake Wars:
Crustacean Devastation." -


1049
00:51:51.856 --> 00:51:53.733
- Six culinary...
- Megamind: Ollo.


1050
00:51:53.775 --> 00:51:56.152
And where have you been?

1051
00:51:56.194 --> 00:51:58.905
Oh, just reminiscing
about days gone by.


1052
00:51:58.946 --> 00:52:02.492
Fragmented memories
of the way we were.


1053
00:52:02.825 --> 00:52:06.746
- What's he talking about?
- Behemoth get the picture.


1054
00:52:07.163 --> 00:52:10.333
Picture...
That's the really good idea


1055
00:52:10.375 --> 00:52:11.959
I was looking for, Behemoth!

1056
00:52:12.001 --> 00:52:14.420
Since this is our
last night on Earth,


1057
00:52:14.462 --> 00:52:16.422
we should really get
a picture of all of us.


1058
00:52:16.464 --> 00:52:18.883
Brainbot 227?

1059
00:52:18.925 --> 00:52:21.052
Everybody squeeze in tight.

1060
00:52:21.094 --> 00:52:22.845
Come on! Don't be shy!

1061
00:52:22.887 --> 00:52:25.598
I really wanna
capture this moment.


1062
00:52:25.640 --> 00:52:27.225
Don't you wanna be in it?

1063
00:52:27.266 --> 00:52:28.559
Maybe the next one.

1064
00:52:28.601 --> 00:52:32.271
Come on! Let's get some
grimaces on those faces.


1065
00:52:33.689 --> 00:52:36.859
On a count of three,
everyone say, "Porta-Prison"!


1066
00:52:36.901 --> 00:52:39.737
Syndicate:
Three, two, one... Porta-Prison?


1067
00:52:39.779 --> 00:52:41.864
Wait!

1068
00:52:41.906 --> 00:52:44.534
And boom goes your
days of freedom!


1069
00:52:44.575 --> 00:52:46.702
Oh yeah! Aha! Ooh!

1070
00:52:46.744 --> 00:52:49.038
Nighty
-Knight: What's going on?

1071
00:52:49.080 --> 00:52:52.291
I'll tell you what's
going on you guys.


1072
00:52:52.333 --> 00:52:54.711
Prison uniforms!

1073
00:52:54.752 --> 00:52:56.796
If this is a joke,
it's not funny.


1074
00:52:56.838 --> 00:52:58.798
Not for you,
but I'll be laughing


1075
00:52:58.840 --> 00:53:01.259
your whole way back to prison.

1076
00:53:01.300 --> 00:53:03.761
Our patience is wearing thin.

1077
00:53:03.803 --> 00:53:05.596
You know what's
gonna make you thin?


1078
00:53:05.638 --> 00:53:06.889
Prison food!

1079
00:53:06.931 --> 00:53:08.474
I could do these all day,

1080
00:53:08.516 --> 00:53:10.184
so let's just cut to the chase.

1081
00:53:10.226 --> 00:53:12.395
I'm really a good guy!

1082
00:53:12.437 --> 00:53:14.856
A champion of justice. A hero!

1083
00:53:14.897 --> 00:53:17.024
No!

1084
00:53:17.066 --> 00:53:18.860
You watch your language
in front of Behemoth!


1085
00:53:18.901 --> 00:53:20.653
Nighty-Knight:
I have been noticing


1086
00:53:20.695 --> 00:53:22.864
Megamind acting strange lately,

1087
00:53:22.905 --> 00:53:25.241
- and not in a good, dark way.
- Oui!


1088
00:53:25.283 --> 00:53:29.412
Idiots! I've been saying
that the entire time!


1089
00:53:29.454 --> 00:53:31.247
If Megamind really hero,

1090
00:53:31.289 --> 00:53:35.334
why he not be honest
and tell old evil friends?


1091
00:53:35.376 --> 00:53:37.920
Because you'd all destroy me!

1092
00:53:37.962 --> 00:53:40.131
That's why you're
locked safely in a...


1093
00:53:41.924 --> 00:53:43.926
...malfunctioning Porta
-Prison?

1094
00:53:47.638 --> 00:53:50.683
Man, I really got you guys!

1095
00:53:50.725 --> 00:53:54.228
It's a prank, bros!
Now, who's hungry?


1096
00:53:54.270 --> 00:53:56.689
Oh, if it was a prank,
then why are you sweating?


1097
00:53:56.731 --> 00:53:59.567
Sweating? Who's sweating?

1098
00:54:01.277 --> 00:54:03.780
Blast you, sweat bead.
Don't do this to me!


1099
00:54:03.821 --> 00:54:05.782
Go back from whence you came!

1100
00:54:09.410 --> 00:54:13.581
Attention, everyone!
Megamind really is a hero!


1101
00:54:13.623 --> 00:54:15.917
He's not pretending!

1102
00:54:15.958 --> 00:54:17.210
Wait, how did we get here?

1103
00:54:17.251 --> 00:54:19.462
Nice of you to pop in.
Megamind's ours,


1104
00:54:19.504 --> 00:54:21.881
but feel free to enjoy the show.
Get him!


1105
00:54:28.721 --> 00:54:31.015
Everything hurts...

1106
00:54:33.226 --> 00:54:36.646
Nighty-Knight: Time to say,
"Nighty, night!"


1107
00:54:36.687 --> 00:54:37.814
See, guys?
In the proper context,


1108
00:54:37.855 --> 00:54:39.982
that name is frightening.

1109
00:54:44.821 --> 00:54:47.490
And where do you
zink you're going?


1110
00:54:58.084 --> 00:54:59.001
**

1111
00:54:59.043 --> 00:55:01.879
Ah! Special chair, eject!

1112
00:55:07.593 --> 00:55:09.345
**

1113
00:55:11.848 --> 00:55:15.184
Think you can just
run away from your problems?


1114
00:55:18.938 --> 00:55:22.775
Ha! No more Megamind!

1115
00:55:25.945 --> 00:55:29.615
With its hero dead,
Metro City belongs to us now.


1116
00:55:30.199 --> 00:55:33.411
But maybe it's time we relocated
to a better neighborhood.


1117
00:55:34.620 --> 00:55:36.372
Mongolia?

1118
00:55:36.414 --> 00:55:37.540
The moon, Behemoth.

1119
00:55:37.582 --> 00:55:39.459
I'm talking about the moon.

1120
00:55:52.930 --> 00:55:54.724
Special chair!

1121
00:55:54.766 --> 00:55:56.976
I failed you.

1122
00:55:58.603 --> 00:56:00.605
I failed everyone.

1123
00:56:09.030 --> 00:56:11.699
Take a right here.
Megamind's close.


1124
00:56:11.741 --> 00:56:13.242
Roxanne:
How do you know that?


1125
00:56:13.284 --> 00:56:15.119
The fan club pin I gave him
has a tracker in it.


1126
00:56:15.161 --> 00:56:17.997
Roxanne: That's pretty devious.

1127
00:56:18.039 --> 00:56:20.500
You are his number-one fan.

1128
00:56:21.292 --> 00:56:24.045
This is kind of
a sketchy neighborhood.


1129
00:56:24.087 --> 00:56:26.631
Going where the danger is
is part of our job.


1130
00:56:26.672 --> 00:56:28.841
Besides,
we've always got diplomacy.


1131
00:56:28.883 --> 00:56:31.010
Oh. Did you learn
that in school?


1132
00:56:31.052 --> 00:56:33.471
No, Diplomacy is just
what I call my bat.


1133
00:56:33.513 --> 00:56:36.933
- Keiko, I think
you're gonna fit in just fine. -


1134
00:56:36.974 --> 00:56:39.685
Stop the van!

1135
00:56:52.657 --> 00:56:54.575
Megamind...

1136
00:56:55.118 --> 00:56:57.161
Megamind:
Never heard of him...


1137
00:57:04.001 --> 00:57:06.295
We've been looking for you
all over the city!


1138
00:57:06.337 --> 00:57:08.673
Wait, what's with
the fake beard?


1139
00:57:08.715 --> 00:57:11.175
You look like
a sad blue wizard.


1140
00:57:11.217 --> 00:57:14.095
Obviously, I'm hiding.

1141
00:57:14.137 --> 00:57:16.723
The city belongs to
The Doom Syndicate now.


1142
00:57:16.764 --> 00:57:19.350
Oh, here!
I have one for you, too.


1143
00:57:19.392 --> 00:57:20.351
We can be beard buddies.

1144
00:57:20.393 --> 00:57:21.978
I don't wanna
be beard buddies!


1145
00:57:22.019 --> 00:57:24.647
I want you to get off
your butt and save the city!


1146
00:57:24.689 --> 00:57:26.274
You're the only one who can.

1147
00:57:26.566 --> 00:57:28.192
Look, that's a nice sentiment,

1148
00:57:28.234 --> 00:57:30.236
but I've made a new life here.

1149
00:57:30.278 --> 00:57:33.614
Yeah. The piles of trash
really tie the alley together.


1150
00:57:33.656 --> 00:57:35.825
Thank you, Madam President.

1151
00:57:35.867 --> 00:57:37.869
Wait, how did you two
find me anyway?


1152
00:57:37.910 --> 00:57:40.413
Us girls gotta
have our secrets.


1153
00:57:40.455 --> 00:57:43.583
Well, that's adorable,
but there's no point.


1154
00:57:43.624 --> 00:57:45.585
I gave the hero thing a shot.

1155
00:57:46.044 --> 00:57:48.421
I can't protect this city.

1156
00:57:48.463 --> 00:57:49.881
I failed.

1157
00:57:49.922 --> 00:57:52.592
**

1158
00:57:52.633 --> 00:57:54.844
You didn't fail me.

1159
00:57:54.886 --> 00:57:55.970
What do you mean?

1160
00:57:56.304 --> 00:57:58.598
When I first moved to
Metro City with my mom,


1161
00:57:58.639 --> 00:58:00.475
I got teased a lot.

1162
00:58:00.516 --> 00:58:01.976
My name, the way I dressed,

1163
00:58:02.018 --> 00:58:04.187
the way I just say
whatever's on my mind.


1164
00:58:04.228 --> 00:58:05.772
I think being an outsider,

1165
00:58:05.813 --> 00:58:07.857
people just assumed
I was a bad kid.


1166
00:58:07.899 --> 00:58:10.359
I started being what
they expected of me,


1167
00:58:10.401 --> 00:58:12.528
getting into fights,
skipping class.


1168
00:58:12.570 --> 00:58:15.073
But then, you stopped Titan.

1169
00:58:15.782 --> 00:58:17.408
It showed me maybe
I don't have to live up


1170
00:58:17.450 --> 00:58:18.910
to others' expectations.

1171
00:58:18.951 --> 00:58:21.245
I just have to
live up to my own.


1172
00:58:21.287 --> 00:58:23.873
If a bad guy can become a hero,

1173
00:58:23.915 --> 00:58:26.000
maybe so can a bad kid.

1174
00:58:26.042 --> 00:58:27.627
Must be disappointing to see

1175
00:58:27.668 --> 00:58:30.421
your hero's such a fraidy-cat.

1176
00:58:30.463 --> 00:58:32.465
No! Shows you're smart!

1177
00:58:32.507 --> 00:58:34.258
Because you have zero
chance of defeating


1178
00:58:34.300 --> 00:58:35.927
The Doom Syndicate on your own.

1179
00:58:35.968 --> 00:58:37.637
I thought you
were my biggest fan.


1180
00:58:37.678 --> 00:58:40.014
I am, but I'm also a realist.

1181
00:58:40.056 --> 00:58:44.018
I'm both comforted
and confused by this pep talk.


1182
00:58:44.060 --> 00:58:46.354
Look, putting aside
your silly pride


1183
00:58:46.396 --> 00:58:49.023
and admitting you
need help is not weak.


1184
00:58:49.357 --> 00:58:51.734
I think you'll find
a true friend is with you,


1185
00:58:51.776 --> 00:58:52.985
no matter what.

1186
00:58:53.027 --> 00:58:54.737
You guys continue
your gooey moment.


1187
00:58:54.779 --> 00:58:56.656
I'm gonna go watch our six.

1188
00:59:00.326 --> 00:59:02.995
This is a big no-matter-what.

1189
00:59:03.287 --> 00:59:05.707
You get our backs,
we'll get yours.


1190
00:59:08.167 --> 00:59:11.087
Okay, but I've got
to find Chum.


1191
00:59:11.129 --> 00:59:13.172
I'm gonna tell him
I took him for granted.


1192
00:59:13.214 --> 00:59:15.091
He's more than a lackey to me.

1193
00:59:15.133 --> 00:59:17.093
He's a partner, a friend,

1194
00:59:17.135 --> 00:59:20.138
and I'm gonna ask for his help.

1195
00:59:20.179 --> 00:59:22.849
Chum:
You don't need to ask.


1196
00:59:22.890 --> 00:59:26.310
Chum?
What are you doing here?


1197
00:59:26.769 --> 00:59:28.438
My work is done with Mr. Donut.

1198
00:59:28.479 --> 00:59:31.315
But, Sir, my work is
never done with you.


1199
00:59:31.357 --> 00:59:33.735
Your constant state of chaos
makes me feel


1200
00:59:33.776 --> 00:59:35.611
as though I'm always needed.

1201
00:59:35.653 --> 00:59:39.031
You are, Ol' Chum. You are.

1202
00:59:39.073 --> 00:59:42.827
After all, what's a hero
without his sidekick?


1203
00:59:42.869 --> 00:59:45.204
Sidekick? Really, sir?

1204
00:59:45.246 --> 00:59:47.915
I can't tell you how long
I've waited for this!


1205
00:59:47.957 --> 00:59:49.000
Keiko:
Diplomacy!


1206
00:59:51.085 --> 00:59:52.879
Ah! I'm so sorry, Chum!

1207
00:59:52.920 --> 00:59:54.630
I didn't know it was you.

1208
00:59:54.672 --> 00:59:55.965
Big fan, by the way.

1209
00:59:56.007 --> 00:59:57.759
Chum:
Wonderful to meet you.


1210
00:59:59.469 --> 01:00:02.638
Nighty-Knight:
The darkness compels you to hit it harder.


1211
01:00:02.680 --> 01:00:04.766
Behemoth is hitting it harder!

1212
01:00:04.807 --> 01:00:06.726
Oh, how long is
this gonna take?


1213
01:00:06.768 --> 01:00:10.480
This titanium plating is
a formidable foe to our powers,


1214
01:00:10.521 --> 01:00:12.732
but, eventually, it will
yield to the darkness,


1215
01:00:12.774 --> 01:00:14.692
as all things do.

1216
01:00:14.901 --> 01:00:16.652
In non-goth speak, please?

1217
01:00:16.694 --> 01:00:19.405
Nighty-Knight:
About an hour if we don't break for snacks.


1218
01:00:20.740 --> 01:00:22.158
Chum:
By my calculations,


1219
01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:23.993
they should be able to break
through the security door


1220
01:00:24.035 --> 01:00:25.328
within the hour,

1221
01:00:25.370 --> 01:00:26.788
if they don't break for snacks.

1222
01:00:26.829 --> 01:00:28.331
We need to draw
The Doom Syndicate


1223
01:00:28.373 --> 01:00:30.375
away from those
launch controls.


1224
01:00:30.416 --> 01:00:31.584
A distraction.

1225
01:00:31.626 --> 01:00:33.795
Something they hate
with so much passion,


1226
01:00:33.836 --> 01:00:36.339
it overrides
their evil mission.


1227
01:00:36.381 --> 01:00:38.216
But what?

1228
01:00:41.010 --> 01:00:43.012
Right!
With all the excitement,


1229
01:00:43.054 --> 01:00:45.890
I forgot they want me dead!
What luck.


1230
01:00:46.182 --> 01:00:48.476
There is a second entrance
to the control room,


1231
01:00:48.518 --> 01:00:49.477
the air vent.

1232
01:00:49.519 --> 01:00:51.020
Can someone get in
through there?


1233
01:00:51.062 --> 01:00:52.688
Unfortunately,
we made sure


1234
01:00:52.730 --> 01:00:55.024
every inch of our lair's
air conditioning system


1235
01:00:55.066 --> 01:00:57.652
was protected by the very
latest in evil weaponry.


1236
01:00:57.693 --> 01:01:00.571
Chum and I prepared
for every possible scenario.


1237
01:01:00.613 --> 01:01:03.199
Except you having to
get back in yourselves.


1238
01:01:03.241 --> 01:01:05.743
- Too-shah.
- Both: It's touché.


1239
01:01:06.202 --> 01:01:09.372
But we're not
our old selves anymore.


1240
01:01:09.414 --> 01:01:11.708
We're better.
We're heroes now!


1241
01:01:11.749 --> 01:01:13.793
And I know the new good us's

1242
01:01:13.835 --> 01:01:15.586
can outthink the old bad us's.

1243
01:01:15.628 --> 01:01:17.797
I can get through
that air vent, Sir.


1244
01:01:17.839 --> 01:01:19.549
You can depend on me.

1245
01:01:19.590 --> 01:01:21.718
I have no doubt I can.

1246
01:01:21.759 --> 01:01:24.554
That leaves you and me
to keep the bad guys busy.


1247
01:01:24.595 --> 01:01:27.515
But, how are we gonna do that
when they have all your toys?


1248
01:01:27.557 --> 01:01:29.934
They're half-wits.
We're full-wits!


1249
01:01:29.976 --> 01:01:31.227
I'm sure we can
think of something


1250
01:01:31.269 --> 01:01:32.687
if we all put our
heads together.


1251
01:01:36.149 --> 01:01:38.234
Huh. We're one head short.

1252
01:01:38.276 --> 01:01:40.486
Keiko? Get in here!

1253
01:01:40.528 --> 01:01:41.738
Seriously?

1254
01:01:41.779 --> 01:01:43.656
Thought you wanted to be
a member of the team.


1255
01:01:43.698 --> 01:01:47.243
Uh, yeah! Uh, but just so
I have this on the record,


1256
01:01:47.285 --> 01:01:48.453
you and I have a deal.

1257
01:01:48.494 --> 01:01:49.495
I help you,

1258
01:01:49.537 --> 01:01:51.622
you train me
to be a crime fighter.


1259
01:01:51.664 --> 01:01:53.249
You help me,

1260
01:01:53.291 --> 01:01:55.585
I'll train you to be
a crime fighter.


1261
01:01:55.626 --> 01:01:57.378
You have my word.

1262
01:01:57.420 --> 01:02:00.548
Which is something
I apparently have to keep now.


1263
01:02:02.717 --> 01:02:05.136
Time to kick some
Doom Syndicate booty.


1264
01:02:05.178 --> 01:02:08.264
Spoken like a true
defender of Metro City.


1265
01:02:08.306 --> 01:02:10.141
This city doesn't
need a defender.


1266
01:02:10.183 --> 01:02:11.726
It needs defenders.

1267
01:02:11.768 --> 01:02:14.729
But first, we're gonna
wanna make a supply run.


1268
01:02:14.771 --> 01:02:16.064
I know where we can go.

1269
01:02:17.190 --> 01:02:19.192
Welcome to Everything City.

1270
01:02:19.233 --> 01:02:20.985
500,000 square feet

1271
01:02:21.027 --> 01:02:23.112
with over 500 locations
in all 50 states.


1272
01:02:23.154 --> 01:02:24.655
Just like the commercial says,

1273
01:02:24.697 --> 01:02:27.075
"If the thing you're looking
for is not at Everything City,


1274
01:02:27.116 --> 01:02:28.117
it's not a thing."

1275
01:02:28.159 --> 01:02:29.952
Chum.

1276
01:02:29.994 --> 01:02:32.663
Set a course for savings!

1277
01:02:34.374 --> 01:02:36.501
Welcome to Everything City!

1278
01:02:36.876 --> 01:02:39.295
We've got less than an hour
to stop The Doom Syndicate,


1279
01:02:39.337 --> 01:02:41.923
so stick to the list.
We're not here to browse.


1280
01:02:45.843 --> 01:02:47.804
* Everything City,
where you feel like a king *


1281
01:02:47.845 --> 01:02:50.014
- Whoa! Ooh...
- * If we don't have it *


1282
01:02:50.056 --> 01:02:51.682
- Ahem!
- * It's not a thing *


1283
01:02:51.724 --> 01:02:54.811
No thermal lasers.
No giant robot suits.


1284
01:02:54.852 --> 01:02:56.687
No polarity reversers.

1285
01:02:56.729 --> 01:03:00.149
Oh, nose hair clippers!
Crisis averted!


1286
01:03:04.654 --> 01:03:05.988
Think fast, Chum!

1287
01:03:06.572 --> 01:03:09.283
* Just waiting for you *

1288
01:03:09.826 --> 01:03:13.079
* Everything City, where
we'll make your heart sing *


1289
01:03:13.538 --> 01:03:16.916
That's just about everything.
Now, just need tennis balls.


1290
01:03:17.834 --> 01:03:19.085
All of them.

1291
01:03:26.175 --> 01:03:28.344
Oh, excuse me,
I'm looking for a parakeet.


1292
01:03:28.386 --> 01:03:30.847
It's a gift of appreciation
for a friend.


1293
01:03:30.888 --> 01:03:33.766
Oh, I've got just the one, sir.

1294
01:03:33.808 --> 01:03:34.934
I give you,

1295
01:03:34.976 --> 01:03:37.103
Mephistopheles...

1296
01:03:37.145 --> 01:03:40.064
...the parakeet of the gods.

1297
01:03:40.106 --> 01:03:42.233
Ah!

1298
01:03:45.737 --> 01:03:47.447
Oh, absolutely not.

1299
01:04:02.462 --> 01:04:05.173
Um, how will you
be paying today?


1300
01:04:05.715 --> 01:04:08.509
Set to crème brûlée.

1301
01:04:08.551 --> 01:04:11.095
Uh, we'll put it on my card.

1302
01:04:11.596 --> 01:04:14.932
Oh, right!
Paying for things.


1303
01:04:14.974 --> 01:04:18.728
Whoever came up with that
scheme is a real evil genius.


1304
01:04:21.522 --> 01:04:23.316
Nighty-Knight:
The darkness fades to light,


1305
01:04:23.357 --> 01:04:26.069
and I have failed to
breach the entrance.


1306
01:04:26.110 --> 01:04:27.403
I have failed.

1307
01:04:27.445 --> 01:04:30.615
I have failed!

1308
01:04:31.741 --> 01:04:34.827
Good news, everyone.
We're in.


1309
01:04:34.869 --> 01:04:36.829
It's about time!

1310
01:04:44.629 --> 01:04:45.922
Say what you will
about Megamind,


1311
01:04:45.963 --> 01:04:48.508
but he's always made
things user-friendly.


1312
01:04:48.549 --> 01:04:50.510
Nighty-Knight:
Whoa! Not so fast.


1313
01:04:50.551 --> 01:04:53.388
- Who said you could press it?
- I'm the leader!


1314
01:04:53.429 --> 01:04:56.349
Are we really gonna
keep arguing this point?


1315
01:04:56.391 --> 01:04:58.559
- We are!
- Nighty-Knight: We gotta figure this out


1316
01:04:58.601 --> 01:05:01.354
if we're gonna live on the
dark side of the moon together.


1317
01:05:01.396 --> 01:05:02.605
Megamind:
Ollo!


1318
01:05:02.647 --> 01:05:05.066
Let me guess.
Leadership squabble?


1319
01:05:05.108 --> 01:05:06.818
Zombie Megamind!

1320
01:05:06.859 --> 01:05:09.862
Obviously he's not dead,
rocks for brains!


1321
01:05:09.904 --> 01:05:13.282
But, he is just in time to
see us complete the job


1322
01:05:13.324 --> 01:05:15.326
he wasn't evil enough
to finish.


1323
01:05:17.495 --> 01:05:19.330
Computer:
Launch sequence initiated.


1324
01:05:19.372 --> 01:05:21.666
Five minutes to ignition.

1325
01:05:21.708 --> 01:05:23.876
Perfect amount of time to
bring you four to justice


1326
01:05:23.918 --> 01:05:26.879
and still be able to microwave
some pop-ed corn.


1327
01:05:26.921 --> 01:05:30.633
Nighty-Knight:
You really think you can go toe-to-toe with us alone?


1328
01:05:30.925 --> 01:05:34.178
- Whoopsie. Not alone.
- You lose.


1329
01:05:34.220 --> 01:05:36.973
Oh! It's Megamind's evil bride!

1330
01:05:37.014 --> 01:05:38.725
Not evil, not a bride.

1331
01:05:38.766 --> 01:05:42.729
That was an act we decided on.
Together... sorta.


1332
01:05:42.770 --> 01:05:45.606
But, obviously, zere
is some romantic tension


1333
01:05:45.648 --> 01:05:48.484
- between you two, no?
- Both: It's complicated.


1334
01:05:48.526 --> 01:05:51.154
Guys, do I have to
villain-splain


1335
01:05:51.195 --> 01:05:52.488
everything to you?

1336
01:05:52.530 --> 01:05:54.907
They're obviously here
to stop the launch!


1337
01:05:54.949 --> 01:05:56.159
Get 'em!

1338
01:05:58.411 --> 01:05:59.662
**

1339
01:05:59.704 --> 01:06:01.622
Chum, code:
"They're coming out!"


1340
01:06:01.664 --> 01:06:04.625
Chum: Got it, sir.

1341
01:06:05.793 --> 01:06:08.087
Nose hair clippers, huh?
Who knew?


1342
01:06:08.129 --> 01:06:10.173
They're industrial grade.

1343
01:06:10.214 --> 01:06:12.467
Code: "I'm going in!"

1344
01:06:12.508 --> 01:06:15.261
Code: "Good luck" and code:
"Try not to get zapped."


1345
01:06:15.303 --> 01:06:18.306
**

1346
01:06:20.058 --> 01:06:22.852
Okay. Just gotta press
the button and stop the launch.


1347
01:06:22.894 --> 01:06:23.770
No need for alarm.

1348
01:06:23.811 --> 01:06:25.313
Huh? The alarm!

1349
01:06:25.354 --> 01:06:27.565
Someone's breaking
into the lair!


1350
01:06:28.232 --> 01:06:30.193
Oh right, that's me.

1351
01:06:33.863 --> 01:06:36.574
Ah! Whoa! Ah!

1352
01:06:37.408 --> 01:06:38.868
Uh-oh!

1353
01:06:38.910 --> 01:06:40.203
Ah!

1354
01:06:43.081 --> 01:06:45.541
Okay. Gotta time this right.

1355
01:06:45.583 --> 01:06:48.503
One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three!

1356
01:06:58.846 --> 01:07:00.932
Hey, I did it!

1357
01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:04.894
Brainbot:
Intruder alert, intruder alert, intruder alert...


1358
01:07:04.936 --> 01:07:07.688
Ahh, why did we have
to be so thorough?


1359
01:07:07.730 --> 01:07:08.981
Brainbot:
Intruder alert.


1360
01:07:09.023 --> 01:07:10.566
**

1361
01:07:10.608 --> 01:07:12.151
Nighty-Knight:
Hey, where'd they go?


1362
01:07:13.277 --> 01:07:15.113
- What the?
- Huh?


1363
01:07:17.198 --> 01:07:19.867
Now the ball is in our court!

1364
01:07:19.909 --> 01:07:23.079
- Get it?
- Not bad, though I would've gone with,


1365
01:07:23.121 --> 01:07:24.497
"Tennis, anyone?"

1366
01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:31.546
- Nighty-Knight:
Ah! Not the face! - You don't have a face!


1367
01:07:31.587 --> 01:07:34.215
Nighty-Knight:
Oh, right. Ah! Ow!


1368
01:07:34.257 --> 01:07:36.259
- Oh!
- Stop moving around.


1369
01:07:36.300 --> 01:07:37.760
I can't get a clean shot!

1370
01:07:37.802 --> 01:07:40.138
Tiny stings hurt Behemoth!

1371
01:07:40.179 --> 01:07:42.473
Stand still, you giant baby.

1372
01:07:42.515 --> 01:07:43.599
Playtime's over.

1373
01:07:43.641 --> 01:07:44.726
Ah!

1374
01:07:44.767 --> 01:07:46.519
Not sure we're going
to beat these guys


1375
01:07:46.561 --> 01:07:48.271
with sporting equipment.

1376
01:07:48.312 --> 01:07:49.897
We just need to buy Chum time,

1377
01:07:49.939 --> 01:07:52.984
and if I know my ingenious
little robot fish monkey,


1378
01:07:53.025 --> 01:07:55.695
he should be cleverly slipping
through the lair's defenses


1379
01:07:55.737 --> 01:07:57.989
right about now!

1380
01:07:58.364 --> 01:07:59.991
Help! I've been caught

1381
01:08:00.032 --> 01:08:02.243
trying to slip through
the lair's defenses! -


1382
01:08:02.285 --> 01:08:05.538
Brainbots:
Intruder alert, intruder alert, intruder alert...


1383
01:08:05.580 --> 01:08:07.665
Okay, relax.
You got this.


1384
01:08:07.707 --> 01:08:09.167
Think, Chum, think!

1385
01:08:10.168 --> 01:08:11.627
Ah!

1386
01:08:13.004 --> 01:08:15.173
- Robot Voice:
Eject, eject, eject! - Ah!


1387
01:08:17.216 --> 01:08:20.970
**

1388
01:08:22.096 --> 01:08:23.681
Yah! Oh!

1389
01:08:23.723 --> 01:08:26.768
I'm gonna miss that body.

1390
01:08:26.809 --> 01:08:28.686
It was my second favorite.

1391
01:08:28.728 --> 01:08:31.439
- Just have to hurry
before I dry out. -


1392
01:08:34.275 --> 01:08:36.736
The launch button!

1393
01:08:37.612 --> 01:08:39.447
Ah!

1394
01:08:39.489 --> 01:08:40.656
Whoa!

1395
01:08:40.698 --> 01:08:43.576
Almost... there!

1396
01:08:43.618 --> 01:08:47.622
Well, well.
Nice of you to flop in.


1397
01:08:48.206 --> 01:08:52.168
Can I trouble you guys for
a tank of dechlorinated water?


1398
01:08:53.461 --> 01:08:55.505
Computer:
Preparing city to launch.


1399

Nine...

- Eight...
- Ah!

01:09:01.302 --> 01:09:03.429
Citizens: Ah! What are we gonna do?

1402
01:09:03.471 --> 01:09:05.640
What's happening?
Run for your lives!


1403
01:09:08.393 --> 01:09:09.936
Computer:
Seven...


1404
01:09:16.317 --> 01:09:17.568
Six...

1405
01:09:18.277 --> 01:09:20.905
I thought Chum was
supposed to stop it by now.


1406
01:09:20.947 --> 01:09:23.699
You know him, always
waiting till the last second.


1407
01:09:23.741 --> 01:09:24.867
Computer:
Five...


1408
01:09:28.913 --> 01:09:30.123
Four...

1409
01:09:33.501 --> 01:09:34.877
Three...

1410
01:09:38.423 --> 01:09:39.382
Two...

1411
01:09:41.592 --> 01:09:44.887
One. Commencing launch.

1412
01:09:44.929 --> 01:09:47.432
There goes the last second.

1413
01:09:56.107 --> 01:09:58.651
Gotta say,
not a fan of Phase Two!


1414
01:09:58.693 --> 01:10:00.403
In theory, it was amazing.

1415
01:10:00.445 --> 01:10:02.905
In practice, kinda horrifying.

1416
01:10:02.947 --> 01:10:05.616
And the hits keep on comin'.

1417
01:10:05.658 --> 01:10:08.161
**

1418
01:10:08.870 --> 01:10:11.622
We'll buy Chum more time
if we split up.


1419
01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:20.173
Help! Outta my way! Me first!

1420
01:10:20.214 --> 01:10:23.092
- What are we supposed
to do now?! - Where am I gonna go?!


1421
01:10:23.134 --> 01:10:24.677
What's going on?

1422
01:10:24.719 --> 01:10:27.430
We're all doomed! Doomed!

1423
01:10:29.098 --> 01:10:31.684
- Mr. Mayor, what's your plan?
- I'm sorry!


1424
01:10:31.726 --> 01:10:33.770
I didn't know I needed
an actual plan


1425
01:10:33.811 --> 01:10:35.980
for the city
launching into space!


1426
01:10:36.022 --> 01:10:38.191
Someone clearly
needs to take charge!


1427
01:10:38.232 --> 01:10:40.276
That's supposed to be you!

1428
01:10:40.318 --> 01:10:42.236
I just remembered,

1429
01:10:42.278 --> 01:10:46.282
I got a really important
lunch meeting. Gotta go!


1430
01:10:49.660 --> 01:10:52.955
Everyone, please
try and calm down!


1431
01:10:52.997 --> 01:10:55.875
- There's no
contingency plan for this! - Somebody hold me!


1432
01:10:55.917 --> 01:10:58.294
Keiko: Everyone,
shut your pie holes! -


1433
01:10:58.336 --> 01:11:01.381
My girl's trying to save
your butts, so listen up!


1434
01:11:01.422 --> 01:11:03.633
You got this.

1435
01:11:06.094 --> 01:11:07.053
Police!

1436
01:11:07.095 --> 01:11:08.971
Have your officers
dissolve panic


1437
01:11:09.013 --> 01:11:11.682
and steer people indoors
or underground.


1438
01:11:13.476 --> 01:11:15.311
- Paramedics,
have ambulances ready. -


1439
01:11:15.353 --> 01:11:18.314
Also, be prepared to
distribute air sickness pills


1440
01:11:18.356 --> 01:11:19.941
in large quantities.

1441
01:11:19.982 --> 01:11:22.652
All for that!
I already barfed twice.


1442
01:11:22.693 --> 01:11:25.655
And firefighters,
I need the keys to that.


1443
01:11:35.248 --> 01:11:38.042
Chum, the whole city's about
to have a new zip code!

1444
01:11:38.084 --> 01:11:40.753
You have to hit
the "Cancel Launch" button!


1445
01:11:40.795 --> 01:11:42.964
Kind of busy
at the moment, sir.


1446
01:11:43.005 --> 01:11:46.384
Yeah, busy getting
turned into sushi.


1447
01:11:46.426 --> 01:11:48.136
I should warn you guys.

1448
01:11:48.177 --> 01:11:51.597
I'm an expert in
the aquatic arts! En guard!


1449
01:11:53.641 --> 01:11:55.309
Whoa!

1450
01:12:06.446 --> 01:12:09.073
**

1451
01:12:10.366 --> 01:12:12.827
Computer: Ascent terminated.

1452
01:12:21.586 --> 01:12:23.588
You did it, Chum!

1453
01:12:26.632 --> 01:12:29.510
Oh no, you did it, Chum!

1454
01:12:29.552 --> 01:12:31.429
The city's falling too fast!

1455
01:12:31.471 --> 01:12:32.930
We have to try to--

1456
01:12:36.768 --> 01:12:39.437
This is the end of the line
for you, Megamind!


1457
01:12:39.479 --> 01:12:42.732
You all do know we're plunging
toward the earth right now?


1458
01:12:42.774 --> 01:12:45.234
Do not try to confuse us
with science.


1459
01:12:45.276 --> 01:12:47.111
Megamind: Wait!

1460
01:12:47.153 --> 01:12:49.405
As former leader of
The Doom Syndicate,


1461
01:12:49.447 --> 01:12:51.074
and according to evil custom,

1462
01:12:51.115 --> 01:12:53.034
I claim my right
to my own demise


1463
01:12:53.076 --> 01:12:56.662
per the Villain Charter,
article seven, paragraph four.


1464
01:12:56.704 --> 01:12:57.914
Syndicate:
Huh?


1465
01:12:57.955 --> 01:13:00.249
The article states that
an outgoing evil leader


1466
01:13:00.291 --> 01:13:03.002
can only be terminated
by the new evil leader.


1467
01:13:03.044 --> 01:13:05.797
So, which one of you
is that again?


1468
01:13:05.838 --> 01:13:08.007
Guys, it's me.
You know it is.


1469
01:13:08.049 --> 01:13:10.218
Nighty-Knight:
I'm the darkest and the doomiest.


1470
01:13:10.259 --> 01:13:13.137
I am ze clear choice.
I have a beret.


1471
01:13:13.179 --> 01:13:16.265
Behemoth wonder if
we can put differences aside


1472
01:13:16.307 --> 01:13:17.767
and find commonality

1473
01:13:17.809 --> 01:13:20.603
in the ultimate
vanquishing of archfoe.


1474
01:13:20.645 --> 01:13:22.230
Nighty-Knight:
Huh...


1475
01:13:22.271 --> 01:13:25.441
He's getting away!

1476
01:13:25.483 --> 01:13:28.236
Nighty-Knight:
Make haste, my fellow doom slayers.


1477
01:13:35.034 --> 01:13:36.786
He's down here somewhere!

1478
01:13:36.828 --> 01:13:39.914
I feel it in the black void
of my soul!


1479
01:13:41.833 --> 01:13:43.292
Chum, are you there?

1480
01:13:43.334 --> 01:13:45.837
You have to get to
the manual controls.


1481
01:13:45.878 --> 01:13:48.631
Computer: City descending.

1482
01:13:48.673 --> 01:13:51.426
No can do, sir.
Lost my bowl.


1483
01:13:51.467 --> 01:13:53.136
No getting out of this one.

1484
01:13:53.177 --> 01:13:54.971
There's always a way out.

1485
01:13:55.012 --> 01:13:57.056
Help is on the way,
friend of friends.


1486
01:13:57.098 --> 01:13:58.558
Polly 227!

1487
01:13:58.599 --> 01:14:01.686
Launch Operation Parakeet! -

1488
01:14:16.409 --> 01:14:17.452
Ha, ha!

1489
01:14:44.520 --> 01:14:45.938
Sir,

1490
01:14:45.980 --> 01:14:49.275
you made me my own
brainbot pet parakeet?


1491
01:14:49.317 --> 01:14:51.527
Megamind:
Chum, meet Polly 227,


1492
01:14:51.569 --> 01:14:54.363
a show of appreciation
for all you mean to me.


1493
01:14:54.405 --> 01:14:58.242
I know you wanted a real one,
but again, so much poop.


1494
01:14:58.618 --> 01:15:01.871
I love him, Sir!

1495
01:15:03.498 --> 01:15:06.834
Eternal darkness
awaits you, Megamind.


1496
01:15:06.876 --> 01:15:08.586
What to do, what to do?

1497
01:15:08.628 --> 01:15:11.214
Disguise generator!

1498
01:15:12.423 --> 01:15:14.550
I can smell your fear.

1499
01:15:14.592 --> 01:15:17.136
It smells like dark bacon.

1500
01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:20.890
Ho-ho!

1501
01:15:20.932 --> 01:15:23.059
Look into my eyes and fall
under my power,


1502
01:15:23.101 --> 01:15:24.811
man of blue.

1503
01:15:27.939 --> 01:15:31.067
Ha, ha!
Zee badge of leadership is moi!


1504
01:15:31.109 --> 01:15:33.611
Don't pop
the champagne just yet.


1505
01:15:33.653 --> 01:15:35.571
Oh?

1506
01:15:41.953 --> 01:15:45.748
Zis is impossibleh!

1507
01:15:45.790 --> 01:15:47.750
Solid!

1508
01:15:49.752 --> 01:15:51.421
Reap the whirlwind, Megamind!

1509
01:15:57.385 --> 01:15:58.636
Not a whirlwind.

1510
01:15:58.678 --> 01:16:01.556
Roxanne was right!
You are terrible at weather!


1511
01:16:01.597 --> 01:16:05.476
Maybe so, but at least
I'd still be around to enjoy it.


1512
01:16:05.518 --> 01:16:08.479
You, not so much.

1513
01:16:08.521 --> 01:16:10.773
**

1514
01:16:10.815 --> 01:16:13.818
I guess you always were meant
to be the leader, Lady Doppler.


1515
01:16:13.860 --> 01:16:15.862
I know, right?

1516
01:16:15.903 --> 01:16:18.990
But a word of advice.

1517
01:16:21.868 --> 01:16:24.287
Stay grounded!

1518
01:16:33.588 --> 01:16:35.923
Oh, why are puns always
so hard to avoid?


1519
01:16:35.965 --> 01:16:38.676
Oh, I forgot all about you.

1520
01:16:38.718 --> 01:16:40.636
When I was on such a good roll.

1521
01:16:40.678 --> 01:16:44.766
Uh, Behemoth figure just wait
until competition eliminated


1522
01:16:44.807 --> 01:16:46.434
before squashing blue man.

1523
01:16:46.476 --> 01:16:48.728
That's actually
a really good plan.


1524
01:16:48.770 --> 01:16:51.355
Behemoth appreciate compliment.

1525
01:16:52.940 --> 01:16:54.609
I squish you now.

1526
01:16:54.650 --> 01:16:56.027
Hey, look over there!

1527
01:16:56.069 --> 01:16:58.446
Behemoth no fall
for oldest trick in the--


1528
01:17:03.701 --> 01:17:06.329
I'm sorry.
Was I interrupting something?


1529
01:17:06.913 --> 01:17:08.164
My hero.

1530
01:17:10.249 --> 01:17:12.502
Behind you!

1531
01:17:17.048 --> 01:17:18.508
Nighty-Knight:
How's this for scary?


1532
01:17:19.884 --> 01:17:22.136
Leadership, here I come.

1533
01:17:22.178 --> 01:17:24.680
Hey, tall, dark,
and trying too hard.


1534
01:17:24.722 --> 01:17:25.932
**

1535
01:17:25.973 --> 01:17:27.892
Nighty-Knight:
Huh? What's that?


1536
01:17:27.934 --> 01:17:31.104
Either a paperweight
or a flash grenade.


1537
01:17:35.900 --> 01:17:37.777
Nighty, night, Nighty
-Knight.

1538
01:17:38.319 --> 01:17:41.030
Huh. Guess it was
a flash grenade.


1539
01:17:41.072 --> 01:17:44.367
You are 100% going up
on my inspiration board.


1540
01:17:46.077 --> 01:17:48.162
No time for laurel resting.
Let's go!


1541
01:17:53.251 --> 01:17:55.586
- Computer:
Reaching terminal velocity. -


1542
01:17:55.628 --> 01:17:59.799
The retro rocket lever is jammed!

1543
01:17:59.841 --> 01:18:01.801
I can't do this alone!

1544
01:18:01.843 --> 01:18:03.594
Megamind:
Nor will you have to.


1545
01:18:04.679 --> 01:18:06.389
This is a team effort.

1546
01:18:06.431 --> 01:18:08.641
Hup!

1547
01:18:10.268 --> 01:18:12.353
Megamind:
We need more mega-muscle!


1548
01:18:12.395 --> 01:18:14.939
Computer: Warning, warning.
Impact is imminent.


1549
01:18:14.981 --> 01:18:18.025
Ground's approaching fast!

1550
01:18:18.067 --> 01:18:19.986
Megamind:
Almost there!


1551
01:18:20.027 --> 01:18:21.904
Computer:
Warning, warning...


1552
01:18:21.946 --> 01:18:23.573
Just a little more!

1553
01:18:26.284 --> 01:18:28.619
Computer: Warning...

1554
01:18:39.964 --> 01:18:41.424
Computer:
City landed.


1555
01:18:41.466 --> 01:18:43.718
Thank you for flying with us.

1556
01:18:46.220 --> 01:18:48.598
You saved the city again, Sir.

1557
01:18:48.639 --> 01:18:50.933
No, we did.

1558
01:18:50.975 --> 01:18:53.269
**

1559
01:18:53.311 --> 01:18:55.772
- Sorry about your body, Chum.
- That's okay.


1560
01:18:55.813 --> 01:18:58.858
- Still got a few spares
in the closet. -


1561
01:18:58.900 --> 01:19:01.277
Roxanne: Oh, would you look at that.

1562
01:19:01.319 --> 01:19:03.029
After the city's already saved,

1563
01:19:03.071 --> 01:19:05.364
here comes the mayor
to take all the credit.


1564
01:19:05.406 --> 01:19:07.492
Or he just wants to
give me another award.


1565
01:19:07.533 --> 01:19:11.079
Award?! After what you
just did to the city?


1566
01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:12.872
Hardly a building
damaged this time.


1567
01:19:12.914 --> 01:19:14.165
We're getting good at this.

1568
01:19:14.207 --> 01:19:15.917
Are you kidding?!

1569
01:19:15.958 --> 01:19:19.253
You put the city backwards! Backwards... Backwards...

1570
01:19:19.587 --> 01:19:21.672
Personally, I prefer
a mountain view,


1571
01:19:21.714 --> 01:19:25.051
- but I'll put it back later.
- Uh, just so you know,


1572
01:19:25.093 --> 01:19:27.136
we all risked our lives
to save the city


1573
01:19:27.178 --> 01:19:29.889
while you were
cowering from your job.


1574
01:19:30.181 --> 01:19:32.683
Oh, you think
you can do better?


1575
01:19:32.725 --> 01:19:34.852
I know I can.

1576
01:19:34.894 --> 01:19:36.104
Oh!

1577
01:19:36.145 --> 01:19:38.231
Um, okay.

1578
01:19:38.272 --> 01:19:41.776
Just sent you my resume.

1579
01:19:41.818 --> 01:19:44.153
Mayor Roxanne Ritchi.

1580
01:19:44.195 --> 01:19:45.947
I like the sound of that.

1581
01:20:00.503 --> 01:20:04.340
We are ready to do thy bidding,
Your Majesty.


1582
01:20:04.382 --> 01:20:07.802
Okay. Okay.
I'm the mayor now, not royalty.


1583
01:20:07.844 --> 01:20:10.096
Forgive us, Your Excellency.

1584
01:20:10.138 --> 01:20:12.765
Got the exclusive
right here, Mega-fans.


1585
01:20:12.807 --> 01:20:14.142
Roxanne on the inside,

1586
01:20:14.183 --> 01:20:16.978
Megamind, Chum, and yours truly
on the outside.


1587
01:20:17.019 --> 01:20:18.646
And all of us working together

1588
01:20:18.688 --> 01:20:21.315
to keep Metrocity
safe from evil.


1589
01:20:21.357 --> 01:20:23.484
You're getting good
at this hero thing.


1590
01:20:23.526 --> 01:20:25.695
You know, I-I think I finally
learned the big difference


1591
01:20:25.737 --> 01:20:28.197
between being a hero
and being a villain.


1592
01:20:28.239 --> 01:20:29.240
What's that?

1593
01:20:29.282 --> 01:20:31.617
Bad guys look out
for themselves.


1594
01:20:31.659 --> 01:20:34.037
Heroes look out for each other.

1595
01:20:34.078 --> 01:20:37.874
Together, we'll be unstoppable.

1596
01:20:37.915 --> 01:20:40.877
Keiko, if you'll do the honor.

1597
01:20:51.637 --> 01:20:55.224
Evil has finally met its match.

1598
01:20:57.602 --> 01:21:00.229
Ugh, you've gotta be
kidding me!


1599
01:21:00.271 --> 01:21:02.607
**

1600
01:21:03.816 --> 01:21:06.736
I call this meeting to order.

1601
01:21:06.778 --> 01:21:09.113
As leader, I permit it.

1602
01:21:09.155 --> 01:21:12.408
No! Me leader!

1603
01:21:12.450 --> 01:21:15.495
Huh?

1604
01:21:15.536 --> 01:21:18.456
Suave Voice:
I must say, I commend you all for your efforts


1605
01:21:18.498 --> 01:21:20.708
against Megamind but, alas,

1606
01:21:20.750 --> 01:21:24.962
you lack the proper leadership
to get the job done.


1607
01:21:25.296 --> 01:21:26.422
Oh, really?

1608
01:21:26.464 --> 01:21:28.049
Ha!

1609
01:21:31.636 --> 01:21:35.139
On second thought,
maybe change is a good thing.


1610
01:21:35.181 --> 01:21:37.392
Suave Voice:
So glad you've come around.


1611
01:21:37.433 --> 01:21:38.601
With my help,

1612
01:21:38.643 --> 01:21:41.270
our blue friend
will rue the day


1613
01:21:41.312 --> 01:21:43.064
he betrayed evil.

1614
01:21:43.106 --> 01:21:46.025
Nighty-Knight:
What makes you think you can take down Megamind


1615
01:21:46.067 --> 01:21:47.276
when we all couldn't?

1616
01:21:47.652 --> 01:21:49.987
Because I, Machiavillain,

1617
01:21:50.029 --> 01:21:54.200
am the evil genius who taught
Megamind everything he knows.


1618
01:21:54.242 --> 01:21:56.536
And I promise, our blue friend

1619
01:21:56.577 --> 01:22:00.123
will rue the day
he betrayed evil!


1620
01:22:02.417 --> 01:22:05.670
* Supervillain,
ahead of his time *


1621
01:22:05.712 --> 01:22:08.923
* Incredibly handsome genius
criminal mastermind *


1622
01:22:08.965 --> 01:22:12.552
* But now, he's all cleaned up
and fighting crime *


1623
01:22:12.593 --> 01:22:15.430
* A superhero that
you stream online *


1624
01:22:15.471 --> 01:22:19.308
* It's Megamind *

1625
01:22:19.350 --> 01:22:22.270
* Oh, feels good
to be good this time *


1626
01:22:22.311 --> 01:22:25.565
* It's Megamind *

1627
01:22:25.606 --> 01:22:29.360
* Oh, it's Megamind *

1628
01:22:29.819 --> 01:22:32.989
* Evildoers,
they better run and hide *


1629
01:22:33.030 --> 01:22:36.659
* Him and his sidekick Chum
are working overtime *


1630
01:22:36.701 --> 01:22:39.912
* That big blue head
never looked so fine *


1631
01:22:39.954 --> 01:22:42.874
* 'Cause he's a hero,
your superhero *


1632
01:22:42.915 --> 01:22:46.210
* A superhero that
you stream online *


1633
01:22:46.252 --> 01:22:49.881
* It's Megamind *

1634
01:22:50.381 --> 01:22:53.259
* It feels good
to be good this time *


1635
01:22:53.301 --> 01:22:56.512
* It's Megamind *

1636
01:22:56.554 --> 01:23:00.016
* Woo! Megamind *

1637
01:23:02.518 --> 01:23:04.145
* Oh yeah *

1638
01:23:05.563 --> 01:23:07.690
* Oh... *

1639
01:23:13.571 --> 01:23:17.033
* It's Megamind *

1640
01:23:17.075 --> 01:23:20.495
* Oh, it's so good
to be good this time *


1641
01:23:20.536 --> 01:23:23.081
* It's Megamind *

1642
01:23:23.122 --> 01:23:24.415
* Sing it with me now *

1643
01:23:24.457 --> 01:23:27.335
* Megamind *

1644
01:23:27.377 --> 01:23:31.339
* It's Megamind *

1645
01:23:31.381 --> 01:23:34.175
* Oh, feels good
to be good this time *


1646
01:23:34.217 --> 01:23:38.012
* It's Megamind *

1647
01:23:38.054 --> 01:23:41.516
* Megamind *

1648
01:23:41.557 --> 01:23:44.560
* Ah... *

1649
01:23:44.602 --> 01:23:48.231
* A superhero that
you stream online *


1650
01:23:48.272 --> 01:23:51.609
* It's Megamind *

1651
01:23:51.651 --> 01:23:55.238
* Megamind rules! *
