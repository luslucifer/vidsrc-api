1
00:00:04.038 --> 00:00:07.166
California love

2
00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.637
California

3
00:00:18.846 --> 00:00:21.766
Knows how to party

4
00:00:21.974 --> 00:00:24.060
California

5
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.980
Knows how to party

6
00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.151
In the city of LA

7
00:00:32.194 --> 00:00:35.948
In the city of good ol' Watts

8
00:00:37.408 --> 00:00:42.413
In the city, the city of Compton

9
00:00:42.413 --> 00:00:44.916
We keep it rockin'

10
00:00:45.125 --> 00:00:48.044
We keep it rockin'

11
00:00:48.044 --> 00:00:50.964
Now let me welcome everybody
to the wild, wild west


12
00:00:50.964 --> 00:00:53.259
A state that's untouchable
like Eliot Ness


13
00:00:53.467 --> 00:00:56.178
The track hits your eardrum
like a slug to your chest


14
00:00:56.178 --> 00:00:58.681
Pack a vest for your Jimmy
in the city of sex


15
00:00:58.681 --> 00:01:01.810
We in that sunshine state
with a bomb ass hemp beat


16
00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.104
The state where you never
find a dance floor empty


17
00:01:04.312 --> 00:01:06.815
It's all good from Diego to the Bay

18
00:01:06.815 --> 00:01:09.735
Your city is the bomb
if your city makin' pay


19
00:01:09.735 --> 00:01:12.238
Throw up a finger
if you feel the same way


20
00:01:12.238 --> 00:01:14.532
Shake it, shake it, baby

21
00:01:14.532 --> 00:01:17.243
- Just shake it, shake it
- Shake it, baby


22
00:01:17.243 --> 00:01:19.955
Shake it, shake it, mama

23
00:01:19.955 --> 00:01:22.040
Shake it, Cali

24
00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:27.254
- What's up?
- What's up is you're late.


25
00:01:27.671 --> 00:01:30.800
We gonna dwell on time
or we gonna do this deal?


26
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.511
- Pasale bascula.
- What?


27
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.597
- Pat him down.
- Oh, right.


28
00:01:35.597 --> 00:01:39.351
- You gonna disrespect me like that?
- It's business, nothing personal.


29
00:01:39.351 --> 00:01:41.645
Personally, that ain't how I do business.

30
00:01:41.854 --> 00:01:43.939
Creo que es una pinche placa.

31
00:01:44.565 --> 00:01:48.319
A cop? Know what? I'm gonna take
my hard-earned pesos elsewhere,


32
00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:50.822
because you're triping. Adios.

33
00:01:50.822 --> 00:01:52.699
Hey, hey, carnal.

34
00:01:52.699 --> 00:01:54.993
I just wanna make sure
you're cool, man.


35
00:01:55.202 --> 00:02:00.207
- Show me the merchandise, Tito Puente.
- Show me the money, 2Pac.


36
00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.924
- A'ight. Yeah.
- Check it out.


37
00:02:08.133 --> 00:02:10.427
Tre! Man, is that you?

38
00:02:10.844 --> 00:02:15.224
Nah, man, you don't know me. Obviously
that bum's a little loco in the cabeza.


39
00:02:15.224 --> 00:02:19.604
I ain't gonna pee on the street no more.
You don't have to give me a citation again.


40
00:02:19.604 --> 00:02:23.149
- A citation?
- You should trust your instincts. I'm LAPD.


41
00:02:23.358 --> 00:02:25.235
Vamanos, vamanos!

42
00:02:33.577 --> 00:02:34.620
Hang on!

43
00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:38.791
Watch out!

44
00:02:44.631 --> 00:02:47.134
Wait! Hold up!

45
00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.097
Quit throwin' stuff!

46
00:02:51.097 --> 00:02:52.557
Sorry! Excuse me!

47
00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:04.236
Oh, that hurts.

48
00:03:04.236 --> 00:03:06.530
Let's move. Go!

49
00:03:09.867 --> 00:03:13.413
LAPD! Watch out, OK?
We're on police business.


50
00:03:13.413 --> 00:03:16.541
Hey, man, watch out for my ride!

51
00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.783
You got the right to remain silent.

52
00:04:01.174 --> 00:04:03.885
I said "silent," not "violent."'

53
00:04:17.233 --> 00:04:20.987
- Get out of the truck.
- Abre la puerta! Esta loco este cabron!


54
00:04:20.987 --> 00:04:23.490
Fuera del carro...!

55
00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.576
Step away from the truck.

56
00:04:25.576 --> 00:04:27.870
Come on. Walk towards me.

57
00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:29.955
Yeah, throw some toys now.

58
00:04:30.581 --> 00:04:33.084
Get on the ground.

59
00:04:35.378 --> 00:04:38.506
It's OK, people.
I got everything under control.


60
00:04:46.223 --> 00:04:48.100
Sorry.

61
00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.480
"The truck barreled through the boardwalk
going 95 miles an hour."


62
00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.443
Did I write 95?
That's suposed to be a four, 45.


63
00:04:56.443 --> 00:04:58.946
"Boo-ya"? What-what the hell is that?

64
00:04:58.946 --> 00:05:01.448
That's, like, boo-ya! 
Break yourself.

65
00:05:01.448 --> 00:05:03.325
This is not a report, Tre.

66
00:05:03.534 --> 00:05:08.331
You can't be writing, "I went Jet Li, Bruce
Lee and Tommy Lee all up in their asses."


67
00:05:08.331 --> 00:05:12.502
No, no, not "in they ass," "up on they ass."
I didn't go in nobody.


68
00:05:12.502 --> 00:05:16.048
- I'm telling you, Brooks, it was hot.
- Not as hot as the captain will be.


69
00:05:16.256 --> 00:05:21.679
Hey, baby face, I got you a little Tre-cycle
in honor of your big bust.


70
00:05:26.476 --> 00:05:30.022
No comeback from the kid!
I'm gonna call Ripley's.


71
00:05:30.022 --> 00:05:32.941
Why don't you call Weight Watchers
while you at it?


72
00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.904
- Bite me.
- It always gotta be about eating with you.


73
00:05:38.155 --> 00:05:40.658
Where the hell is Stokes?

74
00:05:44.204 --> 00:05:47.124
Put that shit down!

75
00:05:47.124 --> 00:05:51.295
You cannot continue to use this
department as your personal playground.


76
00:05:51.295 --> 00:05:55.883
You understand? There's rules.
There's protocol. There's procedure.


77
00:05:55.883 --> 00:06:00.055
- All of which you have continued to...
- ...blatantly disregard.


78
00:06:00.055 --> 00:06:03.392
Cap, man. I got a
tip so I acted on it.

79
00:06:03.392 --> 00:06:06.103
You are a bike cop.

80
00:06:06.311 --> 00:06:10.483
You hear of anything going down,
you go to Detectives Brooks and Gallecki.


81
00:06:10.483 --> 00:06:13.403
They come to me.
Backup exists for your protection.


82
00:06:13.403 --> 00:06:15.280
So they get credit for my bust?

83
00:06:15.488 --> 00:06:19.242
You wanna be part of my team,
that's how it's gonna be.


84
00:06:19.451 --> 00:06:23.205
Man, I don't think you understand
how constricting this spandex is.


85
00:06:23.205 --> 00:06:26.751
Shorts so tight, watch,
all my kids gonna be midgets.


86
00:06:26.959 --> 00:06:30.922
And I've been pedal pushing
for, like, four years.


87
00:06:30.922 --> 00:06:34.885
- I'm ready to be a detective.
- Look, Tre.


88
00:06:34.885 --> 00:06:37.596
I'll admit you got good instincts,

89
00:06:37.596 --> 00:06:42.184
but you got a long way to go
before you're the detective your father was.


90
00:06:42.184 --> 00:06:45.730
Now, I promised him
I'd take you under my wing,


91
00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:50.318
but you make it seem like
it's a really bad idea sometimes.


92
00:06:51.153 --> 00:06:56.158
I want a full report on my desk, and not
you just writing "case closed" on a Post-it.


93
00:06:56.158 --> 00:06:58.869
You got it?

94
00:06:58.869 --> 00:07:02.832
- Largate.
- That means "leave," huh?


95
00:07:02.832 --> 00:07:06.586
Get your ass on the other side
of that door right now.


96
00:07:17.849 --> 00:07:21.811
Hey, do you know
the way onto the avenue?

97
00:07:21.811 --> 00:07:24.523
The one that they said
is where we're going to


98
00:07:24.731 --> 00:07:27.442
If you know the way,
I'm gonna follow you


99
00:08:28.134 --> 00:08:30.220
- Game, baby!
- Whatever. You charged.


100
00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:32.931
- Don't say that.
- Hey, knock it off. You did charge.


101
00:08:32.931 --> 00:08:37.520
- Hey, Cap, we on the same team.
- You could've fooled me.


102
00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:39.605
- A'ight.
- Yeah, yeah.


103
00:08:43.359 --> 00:08:45.236
- Captain Delgado.
- Yeah.


104
00:08:45.236 --> 00:08:48.573
I'm with the commissioner's office.
Could I have a moment?


105
00:08:48.573 --> 00:08:51.076
- Sure.
- Student at the Westbury School.


106
00:08:51.285 --> 00:08:53.788
Body was found just off campus
two nights ago.


107
00:08:53.788 --> 00:08:57.125
His name was Warren Williams.

108
00:08:57.333 --> 00:09:00.670
Why am I being briefed
about a case outside my jurisdiction?


109
00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:04.841
Several influential parents send their kids
to Westbury, including the mayor.


110
00:09:04.841 --> 00:09:08.387
- I know. My daughter went there.
- Which is why the mayor sent me to you.


111
00:09:08.595 --> 00:09:11.307
The death looks to be accidental.
We need to make sure.


112
00:09:11.515 --> 00:09:14.018
- As discreetly as possible.
- Undercover?


113
00:09:14.227 --> 00:09:17.564
That's right. No one else knows
we're going inside except the mayor.


114
00:09:17.772 --> 00:09:21.109
Look no further, sir. Officer Tre Stokes lll,
aka "The Young Gun..."


115
00:09:21.318 --> 00:09:24.446
Aka 23-year-old bike cop
with no undercover experience.


116
00:09:24.446 --> 00:09:26.532
You're not qualified.

117
00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:29.243
Not qualified?
I'm a third-generation cop.


118
00:09:29.243 --> 00:09:31.537
I graduated top of
my police academy class


119
00:09:31.537 --> 00:09:36.960
and shattered the target-shooting obstacle
course record that was held by... you.


120
00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:38.420
No. No.

121
00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:42.383
I mean, yes to...
No to being assigned to this case. No.


122
00:09:42.591 --> 00:09:44.677
- He does fit the profile.
- See?


123
00:09:44.677 --> 00:09:46.971
- Come on, this could be my shot.
- No me jodas.


124
00:09:46.971 --> 00:09:49.265
Who a hoda? What you mean?

125
00:09:49.265 --> 00:09:53.854
- It means I hope I don't regret this.
- May your enthusiasm reflect your work.


126
00:09:53.854 --> 00:09:57.399
I'll notify your captain
as soon as we enroll you at the school.


127
00:09:57.608 --> 00:09:59.693
- School?
- Yeah.


128
00:09:59.902 --> 00:10:03.030
- School.
- Wait, wait. No me jodas.


129
00:10:03.865 --> 00:10:08.453
Forensics didn't find any toxins
in the body or tire marks at the scene.


130
00:10:08.453 --> 00:10:13.250
They determined that the bruise above
his left eye occurred prior to his death.


131
00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:16.378
- Suspects?
- They found this at the scene.


132
00:10:16.587 --> 00:10:20.550
The only name they could make out
was Robert Donovan, your boy here.


133
00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:24.304
Four-sport letterman, class president
and your new best friend.


134
00:10:24.304 --> 00:10:27.641
Your job is to get in with this kid,
see if there's any connection.


135
00:10:27.641 --> 00:10:32.646
You come up with any leads, any leads,
you report them to Brooks and Gallecki.


136
00:10:32.646 --> 00:10:36.818
They're your backup, OK?
Check in with them every day.


137
00:10:36.818 --> 00:10:38.903
Twice a day.

138
00:10:38.903 --> 00:10:41.406
Look, just stay out
of trouble on this one.

139
00:10:41.406 --> 00:10:44.117
Better get to bed early.
It's a school night.


140
00:10:44.117 --> 00:10:47.037
I can't pass for a student.
Look, I got whiskers.


141
00:10:47.037 --> 00:10:49.331
If you look, it's
two and then a shadow...

142
00:10:49.331 --> 00:10:52.043
I got more hair on my ass.

143
00:10:52.043 --> 00:10:55.171
You should put some of that
on your head.


144
00:10:57.882 --> 00:10:59.551
That's your boy.

145
00:10:59.551 --> 00:11:02.679
I know high school doesn't bring back
good memories for you,


146
00:11:02.679 --> 00:11:05.391
but this is your chance
to do things different.


147
00:11:05.599 --> 00:11:08.936
Maybe you can finish your last semester,
get your diploma.


148
00:11:08.936 --> 00:11:12.273
- I got my GED.
- Yeah, you took the easy way out.


149
00:11:12.273 --> 00:11:17.487
- Brooks, look, I'm a cop, not a student.
- Well, now you're both.


150
00:11:54.403 --> 00:11:56.489
I'll handle this.

151
00:12:01.911 --> 00:12:03.580
Hey, man.

152
00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:06.708
You can't park here.
That spot's reserved.


153
00:12:06.708 --> 00:12:11.505
- Who you suposed to be? The valet?
- Dude, you think I'm kidding?


154
00:12:11.505 --> 00:12:15.468
Look, dude, I'm pretty sure you're
a really talented parking monitor,


155
00:12:15.676 --> 00:12:19.848
but this is the student parking lot.
I'm a student so I'm parking here.


156
00:12:19.848 --> 00:12:25.270
If anybody got a problem with it, you tell
'em to take it up with the new black guy.


157
00:12:31.527 --> 00:12:33.613
Who parked in my spot?

158
00:12:33.613 --> 00:12:36.116
New black guy,

159
00:12:36.324 --> 00:12:37.993
Nice car.

160
00:12:40.078 --> 00:12:42.581
Mr. Stokes, we've been waiting.

161
00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:47.169
Here are your textbooks, syllabi,
locker combination, maps,


162
00:12:47.169 --> 00:12:49.881
and Westbury's rules of conduct.

163
00:12:49.881 --> 00:12:54.678
You have six minutes to get to class, which
is located all the way across campus.


164
00:12:54.678 --> 00:12:56.972
Tardiness will not be tolerated.

165
00:12:56.972 --> 00:13:01.977
Oh, and Mr, Stokes, the school uniform
is worn at all times. Welcome to Westbury.


166
00:13:13.865 --> 00:13:14.491
Damn.

167
00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:20.748
Today's lesson is on
deciduous bushes and shrubs.


168
00:13:20.748 --> 00:13:23.877
We will begin with the Aronia bush.

169
00:13:24.294 --> 00:13:27.214
Has anyone here seen an Aronia bush?

170
00:13:29.091 --> 00:13:31.385
Ain't that the president's ugly cousin?

171
00:13:31.385 --> 00:13:33.888
- Can I kick it?
- Yes, you can


172
00:13:34.096 --> 00:13:36.390
- Can I kick it?
- Yes, you can


173
00:13:36.599 --> 00:13:38.893
- Can I kick it?
- Yes, you can


174
00:13:38.893 --> 00:13:40.770
This will be your baby.

175
00:13:40.770 --> 00:13:46.818
You'll name it, take care of it
and not leave it unattended for two weeks.


176
00:13:48.487 --> 00:13:54.118
- I got a cracked baby.
- The crack indicates your son's special.


177
00:13:55.995 --> 00:13:57.872
Can't a brother get a brown egg?

178
00:13:57.872 --> 00:14:00.375
OK, buenos dias, estudiantes.

179
00:14:00.375 --> 00:14:01.835
Hola.

180
00:14:01.835 --> 00:14:03.712
Silencio!

181
00:14:03.921 --> 00:14:06.006
Mira. Roberto, silencio!

182
00:14:06.006 --> 00:14:08.718
Callate!

183
00:14:08.718 --> 00:14:14.140
OK. Quien le gustaria traducirme
lo que esta aqui en la pizarra?


184
00:14:20.606 --> 00:14:22.483
Tracy Stokes.

185
00:14:22.483 --> 00:14:25.820
Would you like to translate that for me?

186
00:14:26.445 --> 00:14:32.285
Actually, it's Tre, and, uh, perhaps you
ain't noticed but I didn't raise my hand.


187
00:14:32.911 --> 00:14:35.414
Sit up, please.

188
00:14:37.082 --> 00:14:41.670
I did notice. Perhaps you're in the wrong
class, because this is an honors course


189
00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:46.467
and my students are expected to answer
my questions en espaĆ±ol. Esta bien?


190
00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:50.847
I...

191
00:14:50.847 --> 00:14:52.099
Yo.

192
00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:55.853
- Yo don't know,
- Yo no se.


193
00:14:55.853 --> 00:14:58.981
No say what?

194
00:14:58.981 --> 00:15:00.858
OK. It's OK. Settle down.

195
00:15:17.752 --> 00:15:19.838
I'm kickin' your ass after class.

196
00:15:22.966 --> 00:15:25.260
Hello? Ashanti?

197
00:15:25.469 --> 00:15:27.554
I gotta go.

198
00:15:29.223 --> 00:15:32.351
Hey. You know the square root of 859?

199
00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:37.565
Mr, Stokes, I presume. Feet.

200
00:15:39.234 --> 00:15:43.614
- I'm Headmaster Powers.
- Man, this is the nicest principal's office...


201
00:15:43.614 --> 00:15:49.245
Yeats wrote, "Education is not just
the filling of a pail, it is the lighting of a fire."


202
00:15:49.453 --> 00:15:54.250
Cheating in an exam, Mr, Stokes,
quenches that fire in an instant.


203
00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:58.213
- An embarrassment for us both.
- I was a little embarrassed. I can't lie.


204
00:15:58.422 --> 00:16:03.636
But it wasn't cheating per se,
'cause Ashanti didn't know the answer.


205
00:16:03.636 --> 00:16:08.224
Do you know why I allowed you
to be admitted mid-semester?


206
00:16:08.224 --> 00:16:10.727
Affirmative action.

207
00:16:10.935 --> 00:16:13.021
Mr. Stokes, please.

208
00:16:13.438 --> 00:16:15.107
Thank you.

209
00:16:15.315 --> 00:16:17.609
Well, your references are impeccable.

210
00:16:17.609 --> 00:16:20.946
You come from a respectable
and affluent family.


211
00:16:21.155 --> 00:16:23.658
You have suport
from a lot of important people.


212
00:16:23.658 --> 00:16:28.038
But above all, your transcript suggests
you have a great deal of promise.


213
00:16:28.038 --> 00:16:31.375
I suggest you take everything
that this fine school has to offer,


214
00:16:31.375 --> 00:16:34.294
because this is your first
and only warning.


215
00:16:34.294 --> 00:16:37.423
One more indiscretion
and you will be expelled.


216
00:16:37.423 --> 00:16:39.509
- Understood?
- Understood.


217
00:16:39.509 --> 00:16:44.305
Good. Well, I trust I won't
have to see you in my office again.


218
00:16:44.305 --> 00:16:46.808
No doubt, baby. Holler.

219
00:16:49.311 --> 00:16:53.065
Yo, yo, yo, yo! Seem like y'all
need some color on the court.


220
00:16:53.065 --> 00:16:56.611
It ain't a basketball team
till you reach the one-brother quota.


221
00:16:56.819 --> 00:17:00.782
I wanna go ahead and apologize to you
about parking in your spot.


222
00:17:00.782 --> 00:17:03.076
- It's my spot, actually.
- OK.


223
00:17:03.076 --> 00:17:05.579
Well, we haven't met yet.
How you doin'? I'm Tre.


224
00:17:05.787 --> 00:17:09.333
Rob. You're in the way of our practice.
You wanna head over there.


225
00:17:09.333 --> 00:17:12.879
- Yeah, it's real, man. You should take off.
- Let's play some ball, man.


226
00:17:13.087 --> 00:17:17.258
What is your deal? You're parking in
our spots, you walk all over our practice...


227
00:17:17.258 --> 00:17:19.553
- What do you want?
- Come on, easy.


228
00:17:19.553 --> 00:17:23.932
Hey, I like that. You think you can get him
to wash my car when we finish playing?


229
00:17:23.932 --> 00:17:26.852
You know what? 
You're finished now.

230
00:17:28.729 --> 00:17:32.484
So long, Tracy.
Have a good practice, buddy.


231
00:17:38.115 --> 00:17:41.869
You got some angry skills there, dog.

232
00:17:41.869 --> 00:17:44.163
I think you mean mad skills.

233
00:17:44.372 --> 00:17:48.751
Mad skills. Is that how they say it
in the concrete jungle?


234
00:17:48.751 --> 00:17:51.463
You hail from the 'hood, huh?
Like LBC?


235
00:17:51.671 --> 00:17:54.591
Southern central? 
City of Compton?

236
00:17:55.843 --> 00:17:58.762
Yo, you really wild around here.

237
00:17:58.762 --> 00:18:03.977
Thanks, I think.
Hey, I'm Alexander, by the way.


238
00:18:03.977 --> 00:18:08.565
You can call me Alex, Al, or if you prefer
the African-American vernacular, G-funk.


239
00:18:08.565 --> 00:18:11.068
G...? Hi, man, Tre.

240
00:18:11.068 --> 00:18:13.362
What's up, Tre? Popin'.

241
00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:18.367
Yo, you know what's going on
with all the intensity over there?


242
00:18:18.367 --> 00:18:21.079
Oh, yeah, well...

243
00:18:21.079 --> 00:18:24.416
You see, Rob captains
this school streetball team.


244
00:18:24.416 --> 00:18:27.336
We're playing in this tourney
called the Blacktop Battle


245
00:18:27.336 --> 00:18:30.255
and they're seeking revenge
on the team that beat us.


246
00:18:30.464 --> 00:18:34.010
- Well, are you on the squad?
- Totally.


247
00:18:34.010 --> 00:18:38.181
I make sure the bench stays warm and the
team stays hydrated with energy drinks.


248
00:18:38.181 --> 00:18:40.266
- Chicks dig that.
- They do?


249
00:18:40.266 --> 00:18:42.769
No. Not at all.

250
00:18:42.769 --> 00:18:45.481
But, you know,
I get to chill with Rob and the crew.


251
00:18:45.481 --> 00:18:49.443
During halftime. We're playing
our crosstown rivals tomorrow night.


252
00:18:49.443 --> 00:18:52.572
- You should come by.
- You know what, Alley Al?


253
00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:55.074
I just might do that.

254
00:18:56.117 --> 00:18:59.037
I'll holler at you.

255
00:18:59.037 --> 00:19:00.289
Holler.

256
00:19:00.497 --> 00:19:03.626
Dear God, may our shots go "swish"
and our defense be tight,


257
00:19:03.834 --> 00:19:07.171
and may the hot young ladies
freak every one of us all night.


258
00:19:07.171 --> 00:19:09.674
Except for Alexander.
We know he doesn't get any.


259
00:19:09.674 --> 00:19:12.177
- Saints on three.
- One, two, three. Saints!


260
00:19:55.975 --> 00:20:00.146
Stop that. Break it up.
Get outta here, 17 red, you're outta here.


261
00:20:00.355 --> 00:20:02.440
Chill out, man.

262
00:20:04.526 --> 00:20:07.029
- Seth, bring it in.
- Let me go, man.


263
00:20:07.029 --> 00:20:09.740
- Come on, let's do it.
- Yo, nice acting.


264
00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:12.243
Hard foul, man, come on.

265
00:20:13.286 --> 00:20:16.414
Hey, pretty boy.
Different school, same story, huh?


266
00:20:16.414 --> 00:20:18.917
Can nobody on your squad
handle me, chump?


267
00:20:18.917 --> 00:20:21.837
Back off, Murdock.

268
00:20:21.837 --> 00:20:24.131
They're killing us out there.
What's goin' on?


269
00:20:24.339 --> 00:20:28.511
Yo, I'll tell you what's goin' on.
They gettin' in your ass like a colonic.


270
00:20:28.511 --> 00:20:31.848
Man, nobody asked you.
Just sit down. We got this.


271
00:20:31.848 --> 00:20:35.393
You can continue to get beat,
or you can beat these bitches down.


272
00:20:35.602 --> 00:20:38.730
Beat these bitches down.
Come on, guys.


273
00:20:38.730 --> 00:20:41.442
Sorry. Heat of the moment.
Orange slice?


274
00:20:41.650 --> 00:20:44.570
We gotta sub someone in,
and Alex is the only one left.


275
00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:47.698
- Y'all wanna win? Put me in.
- No. No way.


276
00:20:48.116 --> 00:20:51.035
- I'm nice.
- Alex, give him your jersey.


277
00:20:51.244 --> 00:20:54.164
- You kidding me?
- Hold this.


278
00:20:54.164 --> 00:20:56.875
Cool.

279
00:20:56.875 --> 00:21:00.629
Yeah, baby. That's what I'm talkin' about.
Good lookin' out, Al.


280
00:21:00.838 --> 00:21:02.715
Come on, Team.

281
00:21:04.175 --> 00:21:06.052
Team.

282
00:21:06.052 --> 00:21:08.138
Everybody, everybody

283
00:21:08.346 --> 00:21:10.640
Let's get into it, get stupid

284
00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:13.769
Get retarded,
get retarded, get retarded


285
00:21:13.977 --> 00:21:16.272
Let's get retarded

286
00:21:16.272 --> 00:21:18.566
Let's get retarded in here

287
00:21:18.566 --> 00:21:20.651
Let's get retarded

288
00:21:20.651 --> 00:21:22.946
Let's get retarded in here

289
00:21:22.946 --> 00:21:25.240
Let's get retarded

290
00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:27.534
Let's get retarded in here

291
00:21:27.743 --> 00:21:29.620
Let's get retarded

292
00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:31.288
Let's get retarded in here

293
00:21:31.288 --> 00:21:33.374
Come on, man. Pass the ball

294
00:21:33.374 --> 00:21:35.459
Lose control of body and soul

295
00:21:35.459 --> 00:21:37.754
Don 't move too fast, people.
Just take it slow


296
00:21:37.754 --> 00:21:39.839
Don 't get ahead, just jump into it

297
00:21:40.048 --> 00:21:42.550
Y'all hear about it, the Peas'll do it

298
00:21:42.759 --> 00:21:45.679
Get started, get stupid
Don 't worry about it


299
00:21:45.679 --> 00:21:49.224
People will walk you through it
Step by step, like an infant, new kid


300
00:21:49.224 --> 00:21:51.310
Inch by inch with a new solution

301
00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:53.396
Transmit hits with no delusion

302
00:21:53.604 --> 00:21:55.690
The feeling's irresistible
and that's how we movin'


303
00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:57.567
Five! Four!

304
00:21:57.776 --> 00:21:59.653
Three! Two!

305
00:21:59.653 --> 00:22:01.113
One!

306
00:22:01.321 --> 00:22:02.990
Game over.

307
00:22:08.621 --> 00:22:10.915
Man, where's your head, man?

308
00:22:12.375 --> 00:22:14.461
- Good game.
- Good game.


309
00:22:16.129 --> 00:22:19.466
You wanna break up with Daddy's little girl
and get with me.


310
00:22:19.466 --> 00:22:23.220
- I don't think so, Eddie.
- Why don't you save yourself some face


311
00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:25.932
and take off before I beat you
twice in one night?


312
00:22:25.932 --> 00:22:30.311
Let me ask you a question first.
What's it like getting my slopy seconds?


313
00:22:31.354 --> 00:22:33.648
- Hey, break it up.
- Get off me, Sleepy.


314
00:22:33.648 --> 00:22:38.862
Yeah, Sleepy, hold your boy back.
Look like a big-ass Gerber baby.


315
00:22:42.617 --> 00:22:45.745
- Break it up. Break it up.
- Let's go.


316
00:22:45.745 --> 00:22:48.456
- This ain't over, Donovan!
- Chill out!


317
00:22:48.665 --> 00:22:53.462
- Hey, I can fight my own battles.
- Come on, Murdock.


318
00:22:58.885 --> 00:23:04.099
"Saints stand-in Tre Stokes' performance
sends Westbury to second round."


319
00:23:04.307 --> 00:23:09.313
I'm gonna need two copies of that - one to
dump on and one to wipe my ass with.


320
00:23:09.313 --> 00:23:12.233
I don't like him either,
but he did help us get the win.


321
00:23:12.233 --> 00:23:15.152
- He had 33 points.
- Yeah, 33 points, Rob.


322
00:23:15.152 --> 00:23:18.281
He had zero assists, man.
I just don't want him on the team.


323
00:23:18.281 --> 00:23:22.244
- Hey, baby.
- I don't think he was talking to me.


324
00:23:22.244 --> 00:23:25.163
- I didn't hear a thing. I don't think so.
- Take care of it.


325
00:23:25.163 --> 00:23:28.918
Teammates, what's crackin'?

326
00:23:28.918 --> 00:23:31.420
Sorry, this table's reserved.

327
00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:34.132
I tell you what,
you're the valet and the maii.tre d'.


328
00:23:34.132 --> 00:23:37.469
You got a lot of jobs. You Jamaican?
Scoot over and quit playin'.


329
00:23:37.677 --> 00:23:41.848
Seriously, just find another place to sit.
That's all. Go on. Go on.


330
00:23:42.057 --> 00:23:46.854
See, now, is that any way
to treat your teammate, huh?


331
00:23:48.522 --> 00:23:51.442
Well, actually the roster's filled. Sorry.

332
00:23:51.442 --> 00:23:53.945
So long.

333
00:23:53.945 --> 00:23:55.405
Yo, Tre!

334
00:23:55.405 --> 00:23:57.074
Yo!

335
00:23:57.074 --> 00:23:59.993
Iodizes your game
but you can't be down, huh, doggy?


336
00:24:00.202 --> 00:24:04.373
Yeah, I've been trying to sit there
for three long, lonely years.


337
00:24:04.582 --> 00:24:06.667
I'll never play a
single second in a game

338
00:24:06.667 --> 00:24:10.839
and I'll never get to chill with that crew
at one of their seaside soirees.


339
00:24:10.839 --> 00:24:13.341
- Swar-what?
- Soirees.


340
00:24:13.341 --> 00:24:15.844
It comes from French. Soirees.

341
00:24:16.053 --> 00:24:20.016
Well, you see, Rob throws down
at this spot in the marina.


342
00:24:20.224 --> 00:24:23.770
Run-of-the-mill high-school gathering -
party like rock stars,


343
00:24:23.770 --> 00:24:29.401
slurp body shots off bikini-clad D-cups and
race souped-up Sea-Doos for high stakes.


344
00:24:29.609 --> 00:24:32.529
Melvin, what's the business, baby?

345
00:24:36.075 --> 00:24:39.412
- What you want, Tre?
- Boy, you got your corn rows done.


346
00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:42.957
- How you keep the ladies off you?
- What you want, Tre?


347
00:24:43.166 --> 00:24:48.171
Why every time I come visit you down here
in the evidence lot I gotta want something?


348
00:24:49.423 --> 00:24:50.883
I need a Sea
-Doo.

349
00:24:54.011 --> 00:24:57.348
So, anyone else man enough
to take a shot at the title?


350
00:24:57.348 --> 00:25:02.145
Gambling is wrong, boys and girls.
Pay up. Come on, pay up.


351
00:25:03.397 --> 00:25:05.899
'Sup, dudes?

352
00:25:07.359 --> 00:25:11.531
- What are you doing here, man?
- I come here all the time, get my tan on.


353
00:25:11.531 --> 00:25:14.868
Why don't you get your tan on
somewhere else?


354
00:25:14.868 --> 00:25:17.579
Come on. I just want
a little piece of the action.


355
00:25:17.787 --> 00:25:20.916
Saying y'all don't want
none of the 1986 classic, boy?


356
00:25:21.124 --> 00:25:23.002
I'll take his money.

357
00:25:23.210 --> 00:25:25.921
See? Go ahead, Bosky.

358
00:25:25.921 --> 00:25:28.216
- Shut up.
- Tip you later.


359
00:25:28.424 --> 00:25:30.718
- Sexy in them shorts.
- Let's do this.


360
00:25:30.927 --> 00:25:35.098
OK. First one to the buoy and back
goes home with the green.


361
00:25:35.098 --> 00:25:37.809
Sure you can handle that thing?

362
00:25:39.687 --> 00:25:42.815
Sure you can handle that?

363
00:25:43.232 --> 00:25:45.526
Are you ready, boys?

364
00:25:47.403 --> 00:25:49.280
Go!

365
00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:54.495
- Dude, what the hell are you doing?
- Just making it interesting.


366
00:27:06.032 --> 00:27:11.663
- Hey, you all right?
- Do I look all right? I just swallowed Nemo.


367
00:27:11.871 --> 00:27:14.166
Hold on, I'll drag you in.

368
00:27:20.214 --> 00:27:23.759
- Get away from my girl, Murdock.
- Why don't you just leave?


369
00:27:23.759 --> 00:27:27.514
- You heard her. Why don't you just leave?
- Why don't you just make me leave?


370
00:27:29.182 --> 00:27:32.311
You know what I like about
you Westbury trust-fund babies?


371
00:27:32.311 --> 00:27:34.813
- Nothing!
- Do something, come on.


372
00:27:34.813 --> 00:27:40.027
Ease up. There ain't gonna be no acting
like you need anger-management classes.


373
00:27:44.199 --> 00:27:46.701
I'll do you just like I did Warren.

374
00:27:48.370 --> 00:27:50.873
Didn't I say there ain't gonna be no...?

375
00:27:52.541 --> 00:27:55.878
- Get off me, man.
- I don't wanna fight you, OK?


376
00:27:56.087 --> 00:27:58.381
Calm down, I done told you...

377
00:28:01.092 --> 00:28:04.638
Are you OK? I'm sorry.
Hold your nose. Hold your nose.


378
00:28:04.846 --> 00:28:07.349
Put your head back.

379
00:28:11.103 --> 00:28:14.232
- Let's go!
- Rob! Let's roll, man.


380
00:28:17.777 --> 00:28:21.323
- Yo, man, you a'ight?
- Don't move!


381
00:28:35.505 --> 00:28:37.591
Tre.

382
00:28:44.890 --> 00:28:50.104
Your boy Tattoo's got a hard head and
some serious anger-management issues.


383
00:28:50.104 --> 00:28:52.399
Edward Murdock.

384
00:28:54.067 --> 00:28:57.404
You know, he used
to go to our school.

385
00:28:58.030 --> 00:29:00.741
He's pissed at me
'cause I'm dating his ex.


386
00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:03.453
I guess I had the better game, huh?

387
00:29:04.287 --> 00:29:06.581
He used to go to Westbury?

388
00:29:06.581 --> 00:29:08.041
Yeah.

389
00:29:08.041 --> 00:29:13.672
But, uh, he got expelled after
this article came out in the Gazette.


390
00:29:13.881 --> 00:29:16.175
What'd he do?

391
00:29:16.175 --> 00:29:19.303
It's a long story.

392
00:29:19.512 --> 00:29:23.475
Yo, we ain't got nothing
but time in here, dog.


393
00:29:23.683 --> 00:29:26.812
Rob Donovan, your father's here.

394
00:29:30.983 --> 00:29:33.903
Now the real interrogation begins.

395
00:29:34.111 --> 00:29:36.405
Here. Use that for bail.

396
00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:43.079
I wish I could. Nothing but a twenty
wraped around some Monopoly money.


397
00:29:43.079 --> 00:29:47.459
You should've brought
the "Get Out of Jail Free" card.


398
00:29:47.459 --> 00:29:50.588
- You gonna be all right?
- Oh, yeah.


399
00:29:50.588 --> 00:29:54.759
The cell brings me
closer to the struggle.


400
00:29:54.759 --> 00:29:57.262
Well, I'll see you tomorrow.

401
00:30:18.744 --> 00:30:21.038
Brooks, this was no accident.

402
00:30:21.038 --> 00:30:24.375
Warren Williams was a reporter
for the school newspaper.


403
00:30:24.375 --> 00:30:29.380
He outed Edward Murdock as a drugstore
and the next day Murdock got expelled.


404
00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:32.092
I need you to
run a sheet on him.

405
00:30:38.766 --> 00:30:41.060
Hey, Rob. What's up, man?

406
00:30:41.269 --> 00:30:43.146
- Nothing.
- What was that all about?


407
00:30:43.354 --> 00:30:45.857
Oh, you know,
been ditching too much class.


408
00:30:45.857 --> 00:30:50.445
Oh, man, I feel you.
I can't miss class no more either.


409
00:30:51.071 --> 00:30:53.365
So, are you ready to roll out?

410
00:30:53.574 --> 00:30:56.494
- Yeah, man. Where we goin'?
- Come on. Play football?


411
00:31:00.873 --> 00:31:03.585
- This ain't football.
- You're gonna love it.


412
00:31:03.585 --> 00:31:07.547
Hugging a bunch of squares in some
short-ass shorts sounds like fun.


413
00:31:07.756 --> 00:31:10.467
- But I'll pass.
- That'd be a first.


414
00:31:11.093 --> 00:31:14.221
Rugby rules. It's easy.
Just touch the ball on your goal line


415
00:31:14.430 --> 00:31:17.767
- or kick it through the posts.
- I got this.


416
00:31:17.767 --> 00:31:20.270
Shoot.

417
00:31:21.313 --> 00:31:23.190
Where the rest of these shorts at?

418
00:31:27.361 --> 00:31:29.655
- What is this?
- Bend down.


419
00:31:29.864 --> 00:31:32.366
- Hey, hey! Keep your hands off me.
- Crouch...,


420
00:31:32.366 --> 00:31:36.121
- Ain't putting my hands in nobody's shorts.
- ...hold, game.


421
00:31:36.121 --> 00:31:37.789
It's on.

422
00:31:42.795 --> 00:31:44.463
Come on.

423
00:31:44.463 --> 00:31:48.634
We don't like you
We just wanna try you


424
00:31:51.971 --> 00:31:56.351
But all this is sickness
The feeling ain't in this


425
00:31:57.185 --> 00:31:59.063
Pass it out!

426
00:31:59.688 --> 00:32:03.651
We don't know where to stop

427
00:32:04.068 --> 00:32:07.405
We don't know where to stop

428
00:32:07.405 --> 00:32:11.785
I try and I try
but I can 't get enough

429
00:32:11.785 --> 00:32:16.999
I won 't fail you
but you won 't bleed for me


430
00:32:18.667 --> 00:32:21.796
Next time pass the ball, Tracy.

431
00:32:21.796 --> 00:32:24.716
Ease up, Bos.
He gets it. Come on, Tre.


432
00:32:28.261 --> 00:32:32.224
We wanna take the Blacktop,
but if you don't pass, we don't win.


433
00:32:32.224 --> 00:32:35.561
Man, you could've just told me that.
Y'all was beating me so bad.


434
00:32:35.561 --> 00:32:39.524
I thought I was gonna have to get
Al Sharpton to come and have a march.


435
00:32:39.732 --> 00:32:42.026
Tre, welcome to the team.

436
00:32:46.823 --> 00:32:52.038
- So, man, where are you from?
- Originally I'm from Philly.


437
00:32:52.038 --> 00:32:55.583
I moved out here with my uncle
when my dad passed.


438
00:32:57.043 --> 00:33:01.006
- Yeah, sorry, man.
- Oh... no, man, it's cool.


439
00:33:01.006 --> 00:33:03.300
My dad was the man.

440
00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:06.845
Sometimes it just hurts.

441
00:33:06.845 --> 00:33:11.225
I never got a chance to tell him
how much I wanted to be just like him.


442
00:33:11.434 --> 00:33:13.728
Yeah.

443
00:33:16.648 --> 00:33:18.525
This is the life.

444
00:33:18.525 --> 00:33:23.113
In my old neighborhood, getting crabs
meant something totally different.


445
00:33:23.948 --> 00:33:28.745
I can't believe my baby girl's
a senior in college.


446
00:33:28.745 --> 00:33:30.622
Yeah.

447
00:33:30.622 --> 00:33:34.584
OK, honey.
Well, I'll see you soon, all right?


448
00:33:34.584 --> 00:33:36.879
Be sure to call your mom.

449
00:33:36.879 --> 00:33:39.381
Bye-bye. Don't you ever knock?

450
00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:45.012
Murdock. Nobody checked his profile
because he got kicked outta Westbury.


451
00:33:45.012 --> 00:33:47.932
I'm telling you, look.
Murdock has priors, motives.


452
00:33:47.932 --> 00:33:51.687
He one of them suburban gangsters.
He belong behind bars.


453
00:33:51.687 --> 00:33:55.024
Let me put him there.

454
00:33:55.024 --> 00:33:58.569
All right, I'll put around-the-clock
surveillance on him.


455
00:33:58.569 --> 00:34:02.949
So go ahead and hook me up with one of
them sick notes so I can get outta school...


456
00:34:02.949 --> 00:34:05.452
Nice try, Tre.

457
00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:10.040
I want you to stay on Donovan. Brooks
and Gallecki can handle the stakeout.


458
00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:13.377
A'ight. You might not wanna
mention steak in front of Gallecki


459
00:34:13.377 --> 00:34:17.131
- 'cause he starts salivatin'...
- Thank you, Tre.


460
00:34:17.131 --> 00:34:20.885
- Is your daughter still fine?
- Goodbye.


461
00:34:22.971 --> 00:34:25.474
- Speak on it.
- Tracy?


462
00:34:25.474 --> 00:34:28.602
- Who this?
- Ms. Lopez. Is your aunt or uncle home?


463
00:34:28.602 --> 00:34:33.399
Ms. Lopez. This isn't about me
failing my Spanish test, is it?


464
00:34:33.399 --> 00:34:36.319
What? You failed your Spanish test?

465
00:34:37.153 --> 00:34:39.865
Here's my auntie right now.

466
00:34:40.490 --> 00:34:42.784
Hello, Ms. Lopez.

467
00:34:42.784 --> 00:34:46.747
Yes. I just want to inform you
that Tre has been struggling in my class.


468
00:34:46.956 --> 00:34:49.041
Yeah. The move has been tough on him.

469
00:34:49.250 --> 00:34:53.004
He's having a difficult time making friends.
He can't even get a date.


470
00:34:53.004 --> 00:34:56.550
- What you doin'?
- May I suggest some tutoring?


471
00:34:56.550 --> 00:35:00.929
- The extra attention might be beneficial.
- I'm available tomorrow after class.


472
00:35:00.929 --> 00:35:04.475
- Tomorrow would be great. Thank you.
- OK. Thank you.


473
00:35:04.684 --> 00:35:09.272
Now, how is it that somebody who speaks
Spanish can be failing Spanish class?


474
00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:11.983
I speak Spanglish, OK?

475
00:35:11.983 --> 00:35:15.320
You know, her class is about
grammar and all that kinda stuff.


476
00:35:15.529 --> 00:35:17.823
Plus it's hard to focus
'cause she's hot.


477
00:35:21.786 --> 00:35:23.246
OK.

478
00:35:23.871 --> 00:35:26.166
"Do you wanna try swimming?"

479
00:35:26.166 --> 00:35:29.294
Quiero probar de nadar?

480
00:35:29.503 --> 00:35:32.422
Listen, Quiero tratar de nadar?

481
00:35:32.422 --> 00:35:37.428
You used probar which is what you use
when you wanna try something like food.


482
00:35:37.428 --> 00:35:41.599
- Not swimming.
- Tratar, babar, chico de bar...


483
00:35:41.599 --> 00:35:45.145
Man, all these verbs mean the same thing.
This is so confusing.


484
00:35:45.353 --> 00:35:50.150
You have to take the time to learn
the basics, I know you have the potential.


485
00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:53.070
OK, Mira. It's like dating.

486
00:35:53.279 --> 00:35:56.616
You can't expect a girl to fall for you
in just one day, right?


487
00:35:56.616 --> 00:35:59.118
Shoot, I thought Spanish was hard.

488
00:35:59.327 --> 00:36:01.830
- Women...
- Nothing that's worth it comes easy.


489
00:36:02.038 --> 00:36:06.627
It's like school. You have to put the work
and the time in, and you'll succeed.


490
00:36:06.627 --> 00:36:10.589
See, school ain't never
really been my thing.


491
00:36:11.424 --> 00:36:16.221
You know, ever since I was a kid
I always wanted to be a man.


492
00:36:16.221 --> 00:36:18.723
School kinda get in the way of that.

493
00:36:18.932 --> 00:36:22.269
I think the point of school
is to make you a better man.


494
00:36:22.478 --> 00:36:28.109
You always wanted to be a teacher? You
ain't never wanted to be a video dancer?


495
00:36:28.109 --> 00:36:31.654
No. Well, I'm actually
a thesis paper away from graduating


496
00:36:31.654 --> 00:36:34.366
with my master's degree in sociology.

497
00:36:34.366 --> 00:36:36.660
OK. I'm scared of you.

498
00:36:36.868 --> 00:36:41.040
Well, if sociology's your thing, why you
here teaching Spanish to silver spoons?


499
00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:45.211
I don't know. I wasn't inspired to write
the paper so I took some time off,


500
00:36:45.211 --> 00:36:47.922
and that's when
I got my teacher's credential.


501
00:36:47.922 --> 00:36:49.591
Like...

502
00:36:49.799 --> 00:36:52.093
Wow, it's, like, three years ago.

503
00:36:52.093 --> 00:36:55.430
I'm glad, 'cause you're
the most gangster teacher I ever had.


504
00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:56.682
OK.

505
00:36:56.682 --> 00:36:58.767
Well, thank you, I think.

506
00:36:58.976 --> 00:37:01.687
No, no, that's good. Muy ganguera.

507
00:37:02.730 --> 00:37:05.859
- You know how to say that in Spanish?
- Si, si.


508
00:37:05.859 --> 00:37:10.864
Well, if you want me to reach my fullest
potential, I'll need a little extra incentive.


509
00:37:11.073 --> 00:37:13.784
You're not gonna say a hug, are you?

510
00:37:13.784 --> 00:37:14.827
Look.

511
00:37:14.827 --> 00:37:21.292
Now, as huggable as I am, we must
keep this on a friend tip, Ms. Lopez.


512
00:37:21.292 --> 00:37:23.795
How about if I pass your next test,

513
00:37:24.004 --> 00:37:27.966
you show some Saints spirit
and show up to the Blacktop Battle?


514
00:37:28.175 --> 00:37:30.052
You got yourself a deal.

515
00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:31.929
A'ight.

516
00:37:33.806 --> 00:37:36.100
- Buckle up.
- Yeah.


517
00:37:38.186 --> 00:37:40.480
Bye, Tre.

518
00:37:44.026 --> 00:37:46.945
If I make this, she digs me.

519
00:37:48.823 --> 00:37:50.491
Headmaster P!

520
00:37:50.908 --> 00:37:54.037
- 50 bucks I make this.
- 100 says you don't.


521
00:37:55.497 --> 00:37:57.165
Yeah.

522
00:38:03.213 --> 00:38:05.090
Watch the back pick.

523
00:38:19.690 --> 00:38:21.567
Man, wake up!

524
00:38:28.658 --> 00:38:33.455
Yes, baby. Blacktop Battle
championship game, here we come.


525
00:38:33.455 --> 00:38:35.958
So, you came by
to see me in my shorts, huh?


526
00:38:36.166 --> 00:38:38.461
I came to give you this. Look.

527
00:38:39.503 --> 00:38:41.798
I'm proud of you, Tre.

528
00:38:41.798 --> 00:38:45.760
- Yo, I'm gonna have to frame this.
- I want you to keep it up, OK?


529
00:38:45.969 --> 00:38:50.140
I'll definitely keep it up
if we can keep up our private lessons.


530
00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:52.643
I'll see you Monday.

531
00:38:54.103 --> 00:38:58.274
Finally, a reason to look forward to school.
Pack me an extra lunch.


532
00:39:02.028 --> 00:39:04.322
- Speak on it.
- Baby face.


533
00:39:04.322 --> 00:39:07.659
Gallecki, you meant to call Domino's,
didn't you? What you got?


534
00:39:07.659 --> 00:39:11.205
We're moving on Murdock
at a warehouse at Alameda and Sixth.


535
00:39:11.413 --> 00:39:13.708
Secure the warrant by ten o'clock.

536
00:39:13.916 --> 00:39:18.922
- Do not make a move until we get there.
- Ten o'clock. I'm on it.


537
00:39:32.895 --> 00:39:34.981
Damn.

538
00:39:35.190 --> 00:39:37.484
Come on, guys, where are you?

539
00:39:40.821 --> 00:39:43.115
Where you goin', Murdock?

540
00:40:29.416 --> 00:40:35.256
- That punk from Westbury's followin' me.
- Hey, what's going on? This ain't cool.


541
00:40:35.256 --> 00:40:38.384
- Yo, man, what are you doin' here?
- Who, me?


542
00:40:38.593 --> 00:40:41.513
- He's got a gun.
- No, no, I ain't got no gun, I...


543
00:41:21.765 --> 00:41:27.605
Something I forget to tell you
the first time we met, playboy. I'm LAPD.


544
00:41:27.605 --> 00:41:32.402
There's something I forgot to tell you
the first time we met, playboy.


545
00:41:32.402 --> 00:41:34.696
I'm DEA.

546
00:41:36.990 --> 00:41:38.867
You know what this is?

547
00:41:38.867 --> 00:41:42.622
No, man, what? Viagra?
Little soldier won't salute no more?


548
00:41:42.830 --> 00:41:46.167
It's Bliss.
Two times the potency of ecstasy.


549
00:41:47.627 --> 00:41:51.173
This is $5,000 worth.

550
00:41:52.007 --> 00:41:58.264
I hate to break it to you, player, but it look
like you got five Gs worth of spring water.


551
00:41:59.307 --> 00:42:04.104
Captain Delgado,
please meet Agent Jones, DEA.


552
00:42:04.104 --> 00:42:06.606
- Agent.
- Captain.


553
00:42:06.606 --> 00:42:09.526
Your man here wrecked four months
of deep cover work for me.


554
00:42:09.735 --> 00:42:12.655
I was days away from
meeting Murdock's suplier.


555
00:42:12.655 --> 00:42:17.452
Whatever. Your boy's a murder suspect for
the October 13 death of Warren Williams.


556
00:42:17.452 --> 00:42:19.954
Oh, yeah?
Here's a little quiz for the student.


557
00:42:19.954 --> 00:42:23.083
How the hell could Murdock have
murdered the kid on October 13


558
00:42:23.083 --> 00:42:26.628
when I was in Vegas
with him that day, huh?


559
00:42:26.628 --> 00:42:28.923
This multiple choice?

560
00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:33.094
Thanks for your help.

561
00:42:33.928 --> 00:42:38.516
Look, Cap, you can't blame all this
on me, man. You green-lit the bust.


562
00:42:38.516 --> 00:42:42.062
Yeah, because I thought
you did your homework. Huh?


563
00:42:42.062 --> 00:42:46.233
I thought you learned from your mistakes.
You were suposed to wait for backup.


564
00:42:46.233 --> 00:42:49.362
Wait for backup? The exchange
was going down so I acted on it.


565
00:42:49.362 --> 00:42:51.656
Crime don't wait on warrants.

566
00:42:51.656 --> 00:42:56.036
Just once I'd like to see you
accept responsibility for your actions.


567
00:42:56.036 --> 00:42:58.956
When are you gonna
start acting like a man?


568
00:42:59.164 --> 00:43:02.501
When you gonna
start treating me like one?


569
00:43:03.753 --> 00:43:08.758
Every time I look at that kid
I see his father. All passion, no procedure.


570
00:43:08.758 --> 00:43:13.555
You know, Cap, Tre's not the same kid
you watched growing up.


571
00:43:13.555 --> 00:43:16.058
He's a cop. He was onto something.

572
00:43:16.475 --> 00:43:19.395
Yeah, well, the aple
doesn't fall far from the tree.


573
00:43:19.603 --> 00:43:23.566
I just wish this aple
wasn't so damn ripe. What?


574
00:43:23.775 --> 00:43:26.069
Look, Cap, I just wanna say I'm sorry.

575
00:43:26.277 --> 00:43:29.406
Yeah, well, don't be sorry, be sure!

576
00:43:31.283 --> 00:43:35.663
All right, you got one more chance, Tre.
Don't let me down.


577
00:43:48.594 --> 00:43:52.348
- Drinks.
- Drinks, drinks, drinks.


578
00:43:52.556 --> 00:43:56.519
- I would like to propose a toast to us.
- Us!


579
00:43:56.519 --> 00:44:00.065
Hear, hear. Blacktop title game, baby.
Drink up, bud.


580
00:44:00.065 --> 00:44:04.236
And to Alexander. Seriously, seriously,
for throwing this party. Thanks.


581
00:44:04.236 --> 00:44:09.450
This is for you, from us, for all the hard
work you do on the sidelines, all right?


582
00:44:09.450 --> 00:44:12.161
- Hey...
- Drink up, buddy. You earned it.


583
00:44:12.370 --> 00:44:16.750
- There it is. There it is, tiger.
- Nice work.


584
00:44:18.001 --> 00:44:21.129
OK, hurry up. Come on. Let's go.

585
00:44:28.638 --> 00:44:30.723
Safe sex is the best sex.

586
00:44:30.932 --> 00:44:33.435
Hey, Tre, what's up, my dog?

587
00:44:33.435 --> 00:44:35.729
Hey, Tre, you came to my party.

588
00:44:35.729 --> 00:44:38.232
You came to my par
-Tre.

589
00:44:39.692 --> 00:44:42.820
- Yo, man, how you feeling?
- Yo, I am feeling groovy.


590
00:44:43.029 --> 00:44:46.574
Rob Donovan asked me
to throw a party in my cradle.


591
00:44:46.574 --> 00:44:50.954
I mean, you probably don't know how big
of a deal that is, but for a guy like me,


592
00:44:50.954 --> 00:44:53.874
it's big - very, very big.

593
00:44:53.874 --> 00:44:57.002
Speaking of your boy Rob,
you seen him around?


594
00:44:57.002 --> 00:44:58.462
No.

595
00:44:58.462 --> 00:45:03.885
But have you ever realized
how weird of a word "llama" is?


596
00:45:04.093 --> 00:45:05.345
Llama.

597
00:45:05.553 --> 00:45:09.099
You don't plan on operating no heavy
machinery anytime soon, do you?


598
00:45:12.436 --> 00:45:15.773
- I'm gonna holler at you, Al.
- Tre, yo. You know I love you, baby.


599
00:45:16.190 --> 00:45:19.110
I love you, big dog.
Back away from the juice.


600
00:45:19.110 --> 00:45:23.490
Don't chat up me, man.
Like, I wanna have your babies.


601
00:45:29.121 --> 00:45:32.667
Come on, Tre.
What'd that basket do to you?


602
00:45:33.918 --> 00:45:36.421
What you doin' out here so early?

603
00:45:36.421 --> 00:45:39.341
I'm here this early every morning.

604
00:45:40.383 --> 00:45:42.886
Damn, Al, you got skills, man.

605
00:45:43.095 --> 00:45:46.432
I'm all day from back here.
Hey, don't tell anybody, though.


606
00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:50.811
I wouldn't wanna tarnish
my towel-boy reputation.


607
00:45:52.063 --> 00:45:54.357
Tell you something, though,

608
00:45:54.566 --> 00:45:57.277
It would be pretty nice
to play in a game.

609
00:45:57.277 --> 00:46:00.823
Just for a minute.
That's all it would take.


610
00:46:01.865 --> 00:46:05.828
It doesn't matter now. When my mom
finds out her car got stolen at the party,


611
00:46:05.828 --> 00:46:10.834
she's gonna take her Jimmy Choo
and shove it into my temple till I'm dead.


612
00:46:10.834 --> 00:46:12.919
Your mom's car got jacked at the party?

613
00:46:13.128 --> 00:46:17.508
- Yo, Brooks, I need you.
- Gonna ask her to prom, baby face?


614
00:46:17.508 --> 00:46:20.219
If I wasn't on such
a top-priority case right now,


615
00:46:20.427 --> 00:46:23.139
I'd say, "You so fat
you gotta drink diet water."


616
00:46:23.139 --> 00:46:29.396
Run a search on all the stolen vehicles in
Westbury Heights in the last few months.


617
00:46:29.396 --> 00:46:31.273
"Westbury Heights.

618
00:46:31.481 --> 00:46:33.984
"Yellow H2."

619
00:46:35.861 --> 00:46:38.155
- Here it is.
- Thanks.


620
00:46:41.284 --> 00:46:45.246
See, a bunch of cars were reported stolen
in Westbury since September.


621
00:46:45.455 --> 00:46:50.043
All were registered to parents of Westbury
students and stolen on weekend nights.


622
00:46:50.252 --> 00:46:52.129
What hapens on weekend nights?

623
00:46:52.129 --> 00:46:55.466
Bubble bath and a half-pint
of Chunky Monkey?


624
00:46:55.675 --> 00:46:59.637
That's really freaky, Brooks, but no.
Parties.


625
00:46:59.846 --> 00:47:02.349
Well, what does this have
to do with the case?


626
00:47:02.557 --> 00:47:05.894
A yellow H2 was heisted
the night Warren Williams was found dead.


627
00:47:05.894 --> 00:47:10.691
I have a hunch whoever jacked that ride
has something to do with Warren's death.


628
00:47:10.900 --> 00:47:14.028
And Saturday night
I was at a party at my boy Al's crib.


629
00:47:14.237 --> 00:47:17.991
This morning I found out that the Jag
his mom owns got jacked out the garage.


630
00:47:18.199 --> 00:47:20.702
So you were at a party
where a car was stolen?


631
00:47:20.911 --> 00:47:24.665
Whoever did it is gonna try to do it again
and I'm gonna catch 'em in the act.


632
00:47:24.873 --> 00:47:27.376
How do you plan on doing that?

633
00:47:27.376 --> 00:47:30.922
Throw a Saturday night soiree.
That's Caucasian for "party."


634
00:47:30.922 --> 00:47:35.093
You know what? Cap lives in Westbury
with his rich, fine wife.


635
00:47:35.093 --> 00:47:37.804
And he's going outta town this weekend.

636
00:47:37.804 --> 00:47:42.184
I'll invite some kids with their pricey rides.
The perp's bound to make his move.


637
00:47:42.184 --> 00:47:44.687
There is no way
the captain'll let you do that.


638
00:47:44.687 --> 00:47:48.650
I can't live in a shoebox.
It would blow my cover.


639
00:47:58.869 --> 00:48:01.789
- Hey, what's up?
- Today is just not my day.


640
00:48:01.789 --> 00:48:05.335
I got a flat tire.
I ain't got no spare, my corns hurt...


641
00:48:05.335 --> 00:48:07.837
Come on, I'll give you a ride.

642
00:48:25.565 --> 00:48:27.651
Hm. Vintage '65 Stingray.

643
00:48:27.859 --> 00:48:29.945
Whose ride is this?

644
00:48:31.405 --> 00:48:34.116
Hey! 'Sup, Uncle Paco?

645
00:48:35.368 --> 00:48:40.999
The Impala got a flat, so, uh,
my man Rob here gave me a ride here.


646
00:48:40.999 --> 00:48:44.544
To my crib, where I live.

647
00:48:46.839 --> 00:48:49.341
Uh, yeah, and you have
a beautiful home, sir.


648
00:48:49.341 --> 00:48:52.887
- Oh, thank you very much.
- You should see the inside.


649
00:48:52.887 --> 00:48:56.224
You know what?
You will on Saturday at the party.


650
00:48:56.433 --> 00:48:58.310
- What party?
- Yeah, what party?


651
00:48:58.310 --> 00:49:02.272
What party? Look at you acting all coy
and stuff. Man, you know what party.


652
00:49:02.481 --> 00:49:06.444
See, he's goin' outta town this weekend
to visit his daughter - my cousin -


653
00:49:06.444 --> 00:49:11.240
and, you know, he said I could throw a little
Saturday-night soiree for all my friends.


654
00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:13.326
Isn't he the greatest uncle?

655
00:49:13.743 --> 00:49:15.829
- See you on Saturday.
- Saturday.


656
00:49:15.829 --> 00:49:18.749
- See you then.
- All right.


657
00:49:22.294 --> 00:49:25.214
- Smile and wave.
- Bye-bye.


658
00:50:00.253 --> 00:50:04.424
What's up, my home pickle?
Alexander T Jeffries in the heezy,


659
00:50:04.424 --> 00:50:06.718
I'm trying a little too hard, aren't I?

660
00:50:06.927 --> 00:50:11.307
Just a little bit. Come on into the party
and get your thing right.


661
00:50:11.307 --> 00:50:14.435
OK, how can a homie
score a hottie like that?


662
00:50:14.435 --> 00:50:17.772
Oh, that's what you like?
Man, come on.


663
00:50:17.772 --> 00:50:20.483
School's in session. 
Watch and learn.

664
00:50:20.900 --> 00:50:25.697
Ladies, how you doin'? I'm Tre and this is
my pimp friend here Alexander the Great.


665
00:50:25.697 --> 00:50:28.200
- Oh, my God!
- Rob Donovan is here.


666
00:50:30.912 --> 00:50:33.206
They probably had herpes anyways.

667
00:50:46.762 --> 00:50:50.725
Ten years in the force and the captain's
reduced us to baby-sitters.


668
00:50:50.725 --> 00:50:55.105
We've been here for three hours, nothing's
happened, and nothing is gonna happen.


669
00:50:55.105 --> 00:50:57.190
Oh, someone needs a hug.

670
00:50:57.190 --> 00:51:00.319
No. What I need is a bathroom.

671
00:51:00.319 --> 00:51:03.447
- Touching cotton over here.
- Oh, God.


672
00:51:05.950 --> 00:51:08.244
Go use the bushes.

673
00:51:08.244 --> 00:51:11.998
I'm not squatting in the bushes.
I gotta drop a deuce.


674
00:51:11.998 --> 00:51:16.587
Look, Cap said we have to stay
until all the kids go home.


675
00:51:40.154 --> 00:51:42.657
Hey. We didn't realize
this was your place.


676
00:51:42.657 --> 00:51:46.203
It wouldn't be a house party
unless we got our freak on for the host.


677
00:51:46.203 --> 00:51:47.663
Word?

678
00:51:47.871 --> 00:51:50.374
Wait. Y'all are 18, right?

679
00:51:50.374 --> 00:51:53.085
Put us together and we're 34.

680
00:52:06.433 --> 00:52:08.519
Brooks, give me your magazine.

681
00:52:09.562 --> 00:52:12.690
- What, are you having trouble?
- I need to wipe.


682
00:52:17.904 --> 00:52:20.824
We're like a reverse Oreo.

683
00:52:20.824 --> 00:52:22.910
Damn.

684
00:52:41.889 --> 00:52:46.686
- Yo. You seen Rob?
- Yeah. He just left, like, two minutes ago.


685
00:52:46.686 --> 00:52:51.274
Ladies, my brother from another mother.
Put it on him.


686
00:52:52.526 --> 00:52:55.237
Yo! Yo, Tre, this place is crazy, huh?

687
00:52:55.446 --> 00:52:57.948
Whoa! I know we haven't
gotten off on the right...


688
00:52:57.948 --> 00:53:01.703
- I'm trying to say thank you for this party.
- Write me a thank-you note.


689
00:53:03.788 --> 00:53:06.499
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.


690
00:53:21.307 --> 00:53:22.767
Oh, crap.

691
00:53:48.629 --> 00:53:51.340
Come on, man. Don't make me do this.

692
00:54:02.186 --> 00:54:04.271
You lost 'em.

693
00:54:04.689 --> 00:54:07.400
And you lost 'em.

694
00:54:07.400 --> 00:54:09.694
All right,who wants to explain first?

695
00:54:09.694 --> 00:54:12.405
My car was blocked in
so I took pursuit on foot.


696
00:54:12.405 --> 00:54:18.245
Have you ever tried to catch a Corvette
in some Timberlands? I mean...


697
00:54:18.245 --> 00:54:20.539
Maybe they should explain.

698
00:54:22.625 --> 00:54:28.256
Uh, we were conducting surveillance
and at the time the perp made his move.


699
00:54:28.256 --> 00:54:33.053
Gallecki was in the bushes
temporarily indisposed.


700
00:54:36.599 --> 00:54:39.101
You were taking a dump on my lawn?

701
00:54:39.101 --> 00:54:40.770
No.

702
00:54:40.770 --> 00:54:44.315
- It was your neighbor's lawn.
- On my neighbor's lawn.


703
00:54:44.315 --> 00:54:48.070
Get outta here. Gotta talk to Stokes.
Go on, both of you.


704
00:54:55.578 --> 00:55:00.375
Look, Cap, I know you're upset about your
car, but I promise I'm gonna get it back.


705
00:55:00.583 --> 00:55:03.920
- Did you have him?
- Who?


706
00:55:03.920 --> 00:55:09.134
You know damn well who
I'm talking about. Did you have him?


707
00:55:09.134 --> 00:55:11.012
I shot, but I missed.

708
00:55:11.220 --> 00:55:13.931
You don't miss.

709
00:55:15.600 --> 00:55:19.771
You're reckless. 
You're dangerous.

710
00:55:19.771 --> 00:55:22.274
And I don't trust you anymore.

711
00:55:24.360 --> 00:55:28.739
You're off the force. Pending investigation,
but you're off the force.


712
00:55:28.739 --> 00:55:32.285
- What's that suposed to mean?
- It means find a new job.


713
00:55:32.285 --> 00:55:35.831
- But all I was trying to do was make sure...
- Hey. It's over.


714
00:55:36.039 --> 00:55:38.750
You got two days
to pack up your stuff.

715
00:55:45.424 --> 00:55:47.927
Let me finish school, then.

716
00:55:47.927 --> 00:55:53.141
I'm close to getting my diploma.
Let me finish what I started.


717
00:55:55.644 --> 00:55:57.938
All right. Yeah.

718
00:55:57.938 --> 00:56:00.650
But as a student, not an officer.

719
00:56:21.923 --> 00:56:25.260
Mr. Nothing's got a lot

720
00:56:26.511 --> 00:56:29.640
He's got a lot to say

721
00:56:35.897 --> 00:56:39.442
He's good at being what he's not

722
00:56:40.694 --> 00:56:43.613
He gives nothing away

723
00:56:48.410 --> 00:56:53.833
Another day goes on by

724
00:56:53.833 --> 00:56:57.796
And he never speaks his heart

725
00:56:57.796 --> 00:56:59.256
Oh, no, no, no

726
00:56:59.256 --> 00:57:01.550
"Add four parts vanilla."

727
00:57:03.010 --> 00:57:05.304
Hey, that's not vanilla.

728
00:57:07.807 --> 00:57:10.727
Well, you know,
chocolate has more flavor.


729
00:57:10.727 --> 00:57:13.021
What are you doing here so late?

730
00:57:13.021 --> 00:57:15.941
If I don't learn how to bake a cake,
my GPA will go down.


731
00:57:15.941 --> 00:57:17.818
Mm. Looks good.

732
00:57:17.818 --> 00:57:22.615
Yeah, it looks a lot better
than the first five I made.


733
00:57:22.615 --> 00:57:25.535
Well, I'm impressed, Tracy Stokes.

734
00:57:26.995 --> 00:57:32.000
And I'm not just talking
about the... about the cake.


735
00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:34.503
Thanks.

736
00:57:38.048 --> 00:57:40.760
So why don't you stop frontin'?

737
00:57:41.803 --> 00:57:44.097
You know you want it.

738
00:57:45.140 --> 00:57:48.268
Tracy, you can't be
saying things like that.


739
00:57:48.477 --> 00:57:50.562
See? There you go.

740
00:57:50.979 --> 00:57:53.482
Get your mind out the gutter.

741
00:57:53.482 --> 00:57:55.985
I'm talkin' about the chocolate.

742
00:57:56.193 --> 00:57:59.739
- You are freak. Ooh...
- Oh, stop.


743
00:58:02.450 --> 00:58:04.744
Me gusta, mami.

744
00:58:05.370 --> 00:58:08.081
No, no, it's cool.
Take your shoes off.


745
00:58:08.081 --> 00:58:10.376
Mi casa es su casa.

746
00:58:15.381 --> 00:58:17.050
Hey.

747
00:58:19.761 --> 00:58:21.847
Brooks.

748
00:58:21.847 --> 00:58:26.018
- What you doin' here so late?
- I'm always here this late.


749
00:58:26.226 --> 00:58:32.066
I guess that would explain your buck-wild
weekends with Ben & Jerry, huh?


750
00:58:32.066 --> 00:58:35.403
Tell me you're not here working
on the Warren Williams case.


751
00:58:35.403 --> 00:58:38.740
Oh, no, no, no.
I was just using this file as a pillow.


752
00:58:39.366 --> 00:58:42.286
Tre, I'm trying to get you
your old job back.


753
00:58:42.911 --> 00:58:46.457
Just lay low for a while,
and you might be a cop again.


754
00:58:47.291 --> 00:58:49.794
It ain't even about that.

755
00:58:50.211 --> 00:58:52.922
Why do you care about this so much?

756
00:58:56.885 --> 00:58:59.179
I been messin' up all my life.

757
00:59:00.639 --> 00:59:03.559
Dropped out of high school
a month before graduation,


758
00:59:03.559 --> 00:59:06.062
broke my dad's heart.

759
00:59:06.062 --> 00:59:11.276
He said I wouldn't amount to anything
if I didn't get an education.


760
00:59:12.527 --> 00:59:15.239
And that man meant the world to me.

761
00:59:16.699 --> 00:59:19.619
I was nothin'
but a disapointment to him.


762
00:59:20.870 --> 00:59:24.833
Look, Rob's a good kid, man.
He's just mixed up in a bad situation.


763
00:59:25.041 --> 00:59:28.378
It makes no sense
that he would boost cars.


764
00:59:30.255 --> 00:59:33.384
There's something else goin' down,
and I'm gonna prove it.


765
00:59:34.427 --> 00:59:36.095
The Aronia bush,

766
00:59:36.304 --> 00:59:42.769
a deciduous shrub which produces
wonderful succulent black chokeberries


767
00:59:42.769 --> 00:59:45.480
that can be harvested
at this time of year.


768
00:59:45.480 --> 00:59:51.112
There are some growing on the west side
of campus down by the old storage facility.


769
01:01:08.071 --> 01:01:11.617
Say hello to my little friend.

770
01:01:43.736 --> 01:01:46.655
- You're overreacting.
- Isn't it convenient?


771
01:01:46.864 --> 01:01:49.575
He shows up in the middle
of the semester. Hm?


772
01:01:49.575 --> 01:01:51.661
Then he chases you down with a gun?

773
01:01:51.661 --> 01:01:57.292
- If someone stole my ride, I'd pull a piece.
- I'm tellin' you, he needs to be dealt with.


774
01:01:57.292 --> 01:01:58.752
All right?

775
01:01:58.752 --> 01:02:01.046
I haven't trusted that punk from day one.

776
01:02:01.255 --> 01:02:06.886
That punk had my back on the beach
while you two made a jailbreak. Just relax.


777
01:02:06.886 --> 01:02:11.683
No, no, Rob. I'm not just gonna relax, OK?
You act like nothing hapened, man.


778
01:02:11.892 --> 01:02:15.229
Not a day has gone by that I haven't
thought about what went down.


779
01:02:15.229 --> 01:02:17.314
- We should call the police.
- And say what?


780
01:02:17.523 --> 01:02:21.277
What are we gonna say?
That he blackmailed us?


781
01:02:26.700 --> 01:02:28.785
Our part of the deal is done.

782
01:02:28.994 --> 01:02:35.251
From now on, we're clean. All we have to
do is lay low and everything will be all right.


783
01:02:35.251 --> 01:02:37.962
Just lay low.

784
01:02:38.170 --> 01:02:40.256
That's the plan?

785
01:02:41.299 --> 01:02:43.593
Let's go.

786
01:02:55.690 --> 01:02:58.818
A stain on Warren Williams' shirt
was tested by forensics.


787
01:02:58.818 --> 01:03:01.738
- It turned out the stain was...
- From an Aronia bush.


788
01:03:01.738 --> 01:03:04.867
We know this. Those trees are
as common as BMWs in Westbury.


789
01:03:04.867 --> 01:03:09.038
- It could have come from anywhere.
- Right, including on campus.


790
01:03:09.038 --> 01:03:12.375
I was lookin' around on where
those trees are, and I found this.


791
01:03:12.375 --> 01:03:14.878
You found a pen on a campus?
That's amazing.


792
01:03:15.086 --> 01:03:20.092
Pay attention. Rob's name was written in
red ink on that notepad found at the scene.


793
01:03:20.092 --> 01:03:23.637
I bet if you test this, you'll find
Warren's prints and an ink match.


794
01:03:23.637 --> 01:03:29.060
- Kid was there. He was onto something.
- All right, what else you got?


795
01:03:29.060 --> 01:03:32.188
I saw a gang of covered cars
being hauled off on a truck.


796
01:03:32.188 --> 01:03:35.317
I followed the tracks.
It led me to a garage housing car racks.


797
01:03:35.525 --> 01:03:39.697
- You saw the stolen cars?
- Nah, but... I saw this.


798
01:03:40.739 --> 01:03:44.285
It's the same customized cap
from the Murdock bust.


799
01:03:44.285 --> 01:03:46.371
You think this has to do with drugs?

800
01:03:46.371 --> 01:03:50.333
I can't prove it, but I got a hunch it has
something to do with drugs and cars.


801
01:03:50.542 --> 01:03:54.713
Rob and his boys are just puppets.
Somebody else is pulling the strings.


802
01:03:54.713 --> 01:03:59.301
You got me up in the middle of the night
to come down here for a hunch?


803
01:03:59.510 --> 01:04:02.430
Sometimes hunches
are how cases are solved.


804
01:04:02.638 --> 01:04:07.227
- You're wasting my time, baby face.
- Look, G, I get it.


805
01:04:07.853 --> 01:04:10.981
I look young, you look chunky.
It's not about that right now.


806
01:04:10.981 --> 01:04:13.692
I need your help.

807
01:04:14.109 --> 01:04:17.029
Together we can make this happen.

808
01:04:18.281 --> 01:04:22.869
If what you say is true, we'll find out
when we question Donovan.


809
01:04:22.869 --> 01:04:27.249
- What are you talking about?
- His prints were in the captain's garage.


810
01:04:27.457 --> 01:04:31.629
As soon as we get the green light
from the commish, we're movin' on him.


811
01:04:41.640 --> 01:04:45.811
You better have a very good reason
for wakin' me up at 6AM.


812
01:04:45.811 --> 01:04:48.731
- I brought you your paper.
- I get it delivered.


813
01:04:48.939 --> 01:04:52.485
- I brought it from the driveway.
- Esta tan viejo como Friegas.


814
01:04:52.485 --> 01:04:55.822
Hey, I know what you sayin'.
No need for name-callin'.


815
01:04:55.822 --> 01:04:57.699
What are you doing here, Tre?

816
01:04:57.908 --> 01:05:00.828
I came by to ask you to hold off
on bringin' Donovan in.


817
01:05:00.828 --> 01:05:03.539
Let Gallecki scope out the school.
My report says...


818
01:05:03.539 --> 01:05:07.710
Hey. Unless you're talkin' about your book
report, I don't wanna hear about it.


819
01:05:07.710 --> 01:05:12.298
Cap, my dad used to say if you don't stand
for something, you'll fall for anything.


820
01:05:12.298 --> 01:05:15.218
If you arrest Rob,
you ruin this kid's whole future.


821
01:05:15.218 --> 01:05:20.224
You should be thinkin' about your future.
Go to school. Learn something, Tre.


822
01:05:20.224 --> 01:05:24.395
Dad also used to say if I needed someone,
I could turn to you.


823
01:05:24.395 --> 01:05:26.898
Guess he was wrong about that.

824
01:05:29.192 --> 01:05:32.321
If she can't take your needs...

825
01:05:32.321 --> 01:05:35.032
Hey.

826
01:05:35.032 --> 01:05:37.743
- 'Sup?
- Let's take a ride.


827
01:05:40.454 --> 01:05:42.957
You know how to use one of these?

828
01:05:44.626 --> 01:05:48.171
Shoot, the basketball court
ain't the only place I'm a sure shot.


829
01:06:16.953 --> 01:06:18.830
Yo, man, what we doin' out here?

830
01:06:18.830 --> 01:06:23.210
I read a really interesting chapter
in my history book about Benedict Arnold.


831
01:06:23.418 --> 01:06:25.087
He made some good eggs.

832
01:06:25.087 --> 01:06:29.467
No, he was a trusted and admired general
in the Revolutionary War.


833
01:06:29.467 --> 01:06:33.847
But then he turned his back
and fought for the enemy.


834
01:06:35.098 --> 01:06:38.226
- I'm sure he had his reasons.
- No, you never betray your men.


835
01:06:38.435 --> 01:06:41.563
Sometimes it's the right choice.

836
01:06:41.772 --> 01:06:47.403
What do you say we end this now,
so no one else gets hurt?


837
01:06:49.489 --> 01:06:52.826
- No, I can't just surrender now.
- Have it your way.


838
01:07:08.885 --> 01:07:11.805
How's it goin', boss?
Cars went off right on schedule.


839
01:07:11.805 --> 01:07:16.393
Good. Good. Look, a small problem
has arisen that I need you to take care of.


840
01:07:16.393 --> 01:07:19.105
Boscoe has given me
some unfortunate information


841
01:07:19.105 --> 01:07:22.233
concerning that new student
Tracy Stokes.


842
01:07:22.859 --> 01:07:24.736
So.

843
01:07:28.282 --> 01:07:30.784
What, you want us to...?

844
01:07:32.036 --> 01:07:34.330
You're kidding, right?

845
01:07:38.710 --> 01:07:41.421
We're cool moving product for you,
but we're not...


846
01:07:41.421 --> 01:07:44.758
12 months ago,
I was given a golden oportunity


847
01:07:44.758 --> 01:07:48.095
to make up for the thankless years
I've devoted to Westbury


848
01:07:48.095 --> 01:07:51.015
with its spoiled darlings
and their daddies' millions.


849
01:07:51.015 --> 01:07:53.518
I can understand that, but we're not...

850
01:07:53.518 --> 01:07:57.272
Tomorrow night sees the culmination
of all our hard work,


851
01:07:57.480 --> 01:08:02.694
and I will allow no one to stand in the way
of what is coming to me.


852
01:08:03.946 --> 01:08:10.411
So, please, less of the "drug dealers with
scruples" routine and just do as you're told.


853
01:08:12.705 --> 01:08:14.165
Cheer up.

854
01:08:14.165 --> 01:08:19.797
I'm about to make you
the wealthiest grounds staff in history.


855
01:08:19.797 --> 01:08:22.716
Guys goin' out!

856
01:08:22.716 --> 01:08:25.011
Come on, fellas, let's do it!

857
01:08:25.011 --> 01:08:27.096
We got these clowns, man.

858
01:08:27.096 --> 01:08:29.390
Chicken! They're live!

859
01:08:29.390 --> 01:08:32.102
Let's go!

860
01:08:37.524 --> 01:08:39.819
- You wanted to see us, Cap?
- Yeah.


861
01:08:39.819 --> 01:08:42.738
I want you to check out
the storage facility at Westbury.


862
01:08:42.947 --> 01:08:46.910
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Hey, Gallecki, just do it, OK?


863
01:08:46.910 --> 01:08:51.498
Be sure to hit the shitter
before you go this time, too.


864
01:08:59.424 --> 01:09:01.926
Yeah.

865
01:09:01.926 --> 01:09:04.638
- Everything on schedule?
- Yo, Rob.


866
01:09:04.846 --> 01:09:07.766
Very good.
See you shortly.


867
01:09:10.269 --> 01:09:13.814
I know you think you have nobody
to turn to, but you can turn to me.


868
01:09:13.814 --> 01:09:16.943
What are you, my peer counselor?

869
01:09:17.151 --> 01:09:20.280
I'm a cop.

870
01:09:23.408 --> 01:09:26.328
- I thought you were my friend.
- Man, I am your friend.


871
01:09:26.328 --> 01:09:30.708
Unless you let me know what's goin' on,
I can't help you.


872
01:09:31.542 --> 01:09:35.296
We pulled a senior prank -
hot-wired Powers' car, and we totaled it.


873
01:09:35.296 --> 01:09:38.842
- He'd expel us unless we boosted...
- Boosted the cars for him.


874
01:09:38.842 --> 01:09:41.762
It would have ruined my life.

875
01:09:41.762 --> 01:09:44.056
What about Warren?

876
01:09:46.976 --> 01:09:49.270
He was investigating the thefts.

877
01:09:49.896 --> 01:09:53.441
He must have been hiding somewhere
nearby, and then he followed us.


878
01:09:53.650 --> 01:09:56.153
He saw us pull the Hummer
into the storage facility.


879
01:09:56.153 --> 01:09:58.655
You saying Powers ran him over?

880
01:09:59.698 --> 01:10:01.575
Why you protectin' him?

881
01:10:01.575 --> 01:10:05.538
Powers hoped in the Hummer and
chased him, all right? That's all we saw.


882
01:10:05.538 --> 01:10:08.666
- Tre, this is over. It's done.
- Man, this ain't done.


883
01:10:08.666 --> 01:10:12.629
This is gonna be with you
for the rest of your life.


884
01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:15.758
Tre!

885
01:10:15.966 --> 01:10:19.720
If you're my friend, man,
you'll just let this go.


886
01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:21.806
Can't do it.

887
01:10:39.325 --> 01:10:41.202
Let's go, fellas!

888
01:10:41.411 --> 01:10:43.496
Come on, boys.

889
01:10:45.373 --> 01:10:48.502
Hey, guys, guys,
bring it in, bring it in.


890
01:10:48.502 --> 01:10:50.588
- Where's Stokes goin'?
- He's out.


891
01:10:50.588 --> 01:10:53.299
Out? What do you mean?
It's the championship game.


892
01:10:53.507 --> 01:10:56.219
I'm out, too.
Cos, you're in for Tre.


893
01:10:56.427 --> 01:11:00.807
- Rob, you sure about this?
- I got business to take care of.


894
01:11:01.016 --> 01:11:04.770
- Who's gonna play for you?
- You wanna win? Put me in.


895
01:11:06.647 --> 01:11:09.567
All right. Saints on three.
One, two, three.


896
01:11:09.567 --> 01:11:12.070
Saints!

897
01:11:12.487 --> 01:11:16.449
OK. Al, stand right there.
Stay out of the way.


898
01:11:24.375 --> 01:11:27.086
Hey, man, can we talk
to you for a second?


899
01:11:27.086 --> 01:11:30.215
- I don't sign autographs.
- You might wanna rethink that.


900
01:11:39.391 --> 01:11:41.685
Nice, Al. May be a shooter.

901
01:11:41.894 --> 01:11:44.188
- Ms. Lopez.
- What's going on here?


902
01:11:44.188 --> 01:11:47.108
- Why don't you head back?
- Are you OK?


903
01:11:47.108 --> 01:11:51.279
- Both of you in the car right now.
- Let's go.


904
01:11:53.156 --> 01:11:55.868
- Get in.
- Get in the car!


905
01:11:57.328 --> 01:11:59.622
Nobody puts their hands on me.

906
01:12:00.665 --> 01:12:02.959
Bruto.

907
01:12:10.676 --> 01:12:12.344
- Headmaster Powers.
- Shut up!


908
01:12:12.344 --> 01:12:14.638
- What's she doing here?
- She was with him.


909
01:12:14.847 --> 01:12:16.724
Somebody, tell me what is going on!

910
01:12:16.724 --> 01:12:19.435
I'm sorry, Karen.
You were one of my favorite teachers.


911
01:12:19.644 --> 01:12:22.564
- Felix, what are you talk...
- Shut up.


912
01:12:25.484 --> 01:12:28.821
I'm afraid your tenure at Westbury
has just come to an end.


913
01:12:29.029 --> 01:12:31.532
Like I said, you only get one warning.

914
01:12:31.532 --> 01:12:33.409
- Bring her with us.
- No.


915
01:12:33.409 --> 01:12:36.538
Anything hapens to her.
I'll bust in your British ass.


916
01:12:36.538 --> 01:12:38.832
- It's gonna be cool.
- Sueltame!


917
01:12:38.832 --> 01:12:41.334
Hey, yo, Powers.
I'm gonna catch you later.


918
01:12:41.543 --> 01:12:45.714
- You're hurting me!
- I have cuffs under the seats.


919
01:12:45.714 --> 01:12:48.217
Get in!

920
01:13:02.191 --> 01:13:03.651
Move!

921
01:13:03.651 --> 01:13:05.945
Or what, birdbrain?

922
01:13:06.362 --> 01:13:09.699
- You can't shoot me, I'm just a kid.
- I hate kids. Turn around, man!


923
01:13:09.908 --> 01:13:12.410
Ask me nicely.
You ever heard the word "please"?


924
01:13:12.410 --> 01:13:13.870
Freeze! LAPD!

925
01:13:25.550 --> 01:13:27.010
Bitch.

926
01:13:27.010 --> 01:13:30.347
Good thing you hate kids,
'cause now you can't have none.


927
01:13:30.347 --> 01:13:32.224
I'm OK. I'm OK.

928
01:13:32.432 --> 01:13:34.309
Brooks.

929
01:13:34.309 --> 01:13:38.898
The headmaster's got Karen. I put my cell
phone in her pocket so we can trace it.


930
01:13:38.898 --> 01:13:41.401
- We gonna get you to a hospital.
- Dispatch.


931
01:13:41.401 --> 01:13:45.572
This is Detective Gallecki.
Put a trace on Officer Stokes' cell phone.


932
01:13:45.572 --> 01:13:48.075
We have a hostage situation.

933
01:13:48.075 --> 01:13:50.577
A hunch, huh?

934
01:13:51.203 --> 01:13:54.331
We've tracked Stokes' Phone
heading south on the 110.


935
01:13:54.331 --> 01:13:59.337
- He's exiting at Long Beach Harbor.
- Got it. He's on the 110 South.


936
01:13:59.546 --> 01:14:02.257
- Look, G...
- Yo, T, go ahead.


937
01:14:02.257 --> 01:14:04.968
Make it happen.

938
01:14:11.642 --> 01:14:13.936
- You need another lift.
- I'm drivin'.


939
01:14:13.936 --> 01:14:15.813
No, I got this. Get in.

940
01:14:22.279 --> 01:14:24.156
Let me see your cell.

941
01:14:28.327 --> 01:14:29.996
Captain Delgado.

942
01:14:29.996 --> 01:14:32.290
Hey, yo, Cap.
Brooks and Gallecki are hit,


943
01:14:32.290 --> 01:14:35.418
a perp is down and dispatch
tracked my phone to the harbor.


944
01:14:35.627 --> 01:14:38.755
Whoa, Dispatch, harbor...
Tre, what the hell's going on?


945
01:14:38.755 --> 01:14:42.510
What's going on is I need mad backup.
Send the damn cavalry.


946
01:14:42.718 --> 01:14:46.264
LAPD, SWAT, Hawaii Five-0,
whoever you got. It's goin' down!


947
01:14:46.264 --> 01:14:48.141
I'll send some black-and-whites.

948
01:14:48.349 --> 01:14:53.355
Go anywhere near that harbor. I'll file
obstruction-of-justice charges against you.


949
01:14:53.355 --> 01:14:56.275
Tre, I know you can hear...

950
01:14:56.275 --> 01:15:00.446
Hey, if we end up having to be cellmates,
I got the top bunk.


951
01:15:07.329 --> 01:15:11.500
- I brought some artillery.
- Since when are you straped?


952
01:15:11.500 --> 01:15:13.794
It's a paint-ball gun.

953
01:15:17.757 --> 01:15:21.928
- Come on, man, let's go!
- If I scratch this car, my dad will kill me.


954
01:15:21.928 --> 01:15:25.891
Your dad gonna kill... Man, you ain't
gonna get a scratch. Come on!


955
01:15:34.025 --> 01:15:35.902
Go around 'em.

956
01:15:37.987 --> 01:15:39.239
Oh, sh...

957
01:15:40.281 --> 01:15:42.159
Oh, Lordy!

958
01:15:49.458 --> 01:15:52.378
Oh, shit!

959
01:16:16.571 --> 01:16:19.700
Let me go, Felix.

960
01:16:19.700 --> 01:16:23.245
- Hey, let me go!
- We'll deal with her later.


961
01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.502
- Julian.
- Felix.


962
01:16:29.502 --> 01:16:32.631
- You're late.
- LA traffic. Always unpredictable.


963
01:16:33.256 --> 01:16:37.428
I wondered why my customers wanted
to take those nice new cars overseas.


964
01:16:37.428 --> 01:16:40.556
Speaking of which,
could we see some nice new cars?


965
01:16:42.433 --> 01:16:45.562
- The product?
- Felix.


966
01:16:48.690 --> 01:16:51.819
- So your man's got you dealing, too?
- What are you talking about?


967
01:16:52.027 --> 01:16:54.321
The storage facility was set up for Bliss.

968
01:16:54.530 --> 01:16:59.535
All we did was jack the cars. I mean, we
wanted out. He forced us to keep stealing.


969
01:16:59.535 --> 01:17:02.247
What does Powers want
with a bunch of stolen cars?


970
01:17:02.247 --> 01:17:06.418
Look, I'm guessing he's selling
for a lot of cash.


971
01:17:06.418 --> 01:17:08.712
Or trading it for a lot of Bliss.

972
01:17:21.017 --> 01:17:23.103
Your worker bees have been busy.

973
01:17:23.103 --> 01:17:25.814
Westbury students are known
for their dedication.


974
01:17:27.066 --> 01:17:29.151
Cut the lights.

975
01:17:34.157 --> 01:17:39.997
There he go. He got his boys with him
like a bunch of English crips. Punk ass.


976
01:17:40.622 --> 01:17:44.794
- So what's the play?
- See that warehouse?


977
01:17:45.211 --> 01:17:47.296
Drive into it.

978
01:17:48.339 --> 01:17:52.302
Like I said, if I get a scratch on this car,
my dad will kill me.


979
01:17:52.302 --> 01:17:55.639
So. Professor, how's your chemistry?

980
01:17:55.639 --> 01:17:56.890
Mr. Smith?

981
01:18:06.693 --> 01:18:07.735
It's good.

982
01:18:07.944 --> 01:18:10.655
Whose car is this?
Drive the car into the warehouse.


983
01:18:10.864 --> 01:18:12.741
- You ready?
- Drive the car!


984
01:18:12.741 --> 01:18:15.035
Drive this car into the warehouse.

985
01:18:15.244 --> 01:18:19.832
- You hapy, Felix?
- Blissful.


986
01:18:21.709 --> 01:18:22.961
Jesus!

987
01:18:33.180 --> 01:18:35.057
Get down!

988
01:19:26.364 --> 01:19:28.032
Move!

989
01:19:46.386 --> 01:19:48.263
Your daddy gonna kill you.

990
01:19:48.471 --> 01:19:51.183
Oh! You're on fire!

991
01:20:08.911 --> 01:20:12.456
- Man, I need you to cover me.
- What?


992
01:21:07.308 --> 01:21:10.019
You're hurting me.

993
01:21:11.062 --> 01:21:15.234
- Let her go!
- You're in no position to make demands.


994
01:21:15.442 --> 01:21:18.571
One more step, and you ain't
gonna make it to the prison prom.


995
01:21:18.571 --> 01:21:21.490
You wouldn't want me to hurt
your favorite teacher.


996
01:21:21.490 --> 01:21:22.533
Karen...

997
01:21:32.127 --> 01:21:34.421
Yo, Karen, you OK?
Stay here. Help's on the way.


998
01:21:34.630 --> 01:21:36.507
OK, OK.

999
01:22:26.145 --> 01:22:28.856
Told you I was gonna catch
your punk ass.


1000
01:23:33.719 --> 01:23:36.222
Go over by that barge.

1001
01:24:07.715 --> 01:24:10.218
There he is.
There he is, right there.


1002
01:24:10.426 --> 01:24:13.138
All right, take her down. Slowly.

1003
01:24:22.732 --> 01:24:25.860
Tre, Tre, grab on to the skid!

1004
01:24:28.363 --> 01:24:31.283
Grab on. We'll take you to shore.

1005
01:24:47.133 --> 01:24:50.679
Yo, Sumter. I'll handle this, man.
Thanks a lot.


1006
01:24:50.679 --> 01:24:54.225
You have nothing to worry about.
You guys are minors, under duress.


1007
01:24:54.225 --> 01:24:57.979
I'll talk to some people.
You won't see any jail time. You'll be fine.


1008
01:24:57.979 --> 01:25:00.899
I know. I'm just glad this is over.

1009
01:25:00.899 --> 01:25:06.113
Might have to put you on the side of
the freeway in an orange jumpsuit, though.


1010
01:25:06.321 --> 01:25:08.615
In the car, man.

1011
01:25:08.615 --> 01:25:10.493
Yo, Tre.

1012
01:25:10.701 --> 01:25:12.578
Thanks, man.

1013
01:25:12.578 --> 01:25:15.081
No doubt.

1014
01:25:15.081 --> 01:25:19.461
Keep your cheeks together.
Did you check on Brooks and Gallecki?


1015
01:25:19.461 --> 01:25:22.381
They're on their way to the hospital.
They'll be fine.


1016
01:25:22.381 --> 01:25:25.092
You knew I wasn't gonna
give up on that case, huh?


1017
01:25:25.092 --> 01:25:28.012
Yeah, well, it runs in the family.

1018
01:25:28.846 --> 01:25:33.643
Really think I got a chance
to be as good a detective as my pops?


1019
01:25:33.643 --> 01:25:35.312
No.

1020
01:25:35.520 --> 01:25:38.231
You got a shot to be better.

1021
01:25:38.231 --> 01:25:40.526
Come on.

1022
01:25:49.077 --> 01:25:51.997
- I'm fine. It doesn't hurt.
- I could take it from here.


1023
01:25:51.997 --> 01:25:54.082
- Here you go.
- Thanks a lot.


1024
01:25:54.082 --> 01:25:56.585
Tre, I can't believe you.

1025
01:25:56.585 --> 01:25:59.505
Oh, I'm sorry, Karen.
I couldn't tell you I was a cop.


1026
01:25:59.713 --> 01:26:02.842
No, I can't believe
you used perfect grammar.


1027
01:26:03.050 --> 01:26:08.264
Oh, see, I gotta give credit to my teacher.
She said if I put the work in, I'd succeed.


1028
01:26:08.264 --> 01:26:12.853
And, uh, speaking of work, I have to ask
you a couple of questions for my report.


1029
01:26:12.853 --> 01:26:15.773
Really? Look who's fronting now.

1030
01:26:17.441 --> 01:26:20.153
At least can we start
with your phone number?


1031
01:26:20.153 --> 01:26:23.281
No. It's not gonna be that easy, Tre.

1032
01:26:23.281 --> 01:26:25.992
Anyway, you don't think
you're a little too young?


1033
01:26:26.201 --> 01:26:30.164
Maybe there's a few years between us,
but I'm willing to put the time in,


1034
01:26:30.372 --> 01:26:32.666
figure out your likes and your dislikes.

1035
01:26:35.378 --> 01:26:38.089
I believe I deserve that chance.

1036
01:26:44.763 --> 01:26:47.057
Es verdad.

1037
01:26:52.688 --> 01:26:54.774
You do.

1038
01:27:05.828 --> 01:27:09.165
- I got it, honey.
- Yo, what's happening, Captain?


1039
01:27:09.165 --> 01:27:12.085
- Hey.
- Look, Bam!


1040
01:27:12.085 --> 01:27:14.170
Hey-hey, you got your diploma.

1041
01:27:14.170 --> 01:27:17.716
- They gave me a mid-year graduation.
- Oh, yeah?


1042
01:27:17.716 --> 01:27:20.636
Looks good on me, right?
What?


1043
01:27:20.636 --> 01:27:25.016
As a matter of fact, it does.
I'm proud of you, Tre.


1044
01:27:25.016 --> 01:27:29.187
Look, Cap, I just wanna say thank you
for everything you've done for me.


1045
01:27:29.395 --> 01:27:31.273
Yeah, it's all good.

1046
01:27:31.273 --> 01:27:35.027
To show my gratitude, thought I'd hook
you up with a little something.


1047
01:27:35.027 --> 01:27:38.155
Oh, Juanita, my baby.

1048
01:27:38.155 --> 01:27:40.866
Ese.

1049
01:27:40.866 --> 01:27:45.872
Oh, so too much, eh?
You did good, Holmes.


1050
01:27:45.872 --> 01:27:48.792
Hey, you know,
tried to do what I could do.


1051
01:27:51.295 --> 01:27:54.006
I knew my job wasn't
quite done, you know.


1052
01:27:55.466 --> 01:27:57.760
Sounds good.

1053
01:27:57.760 --> 01:27:59.846
What's this here?

1054
01:28:01.723 --> 01:28:02.974
Now it is.

1055
01:28:17.573 --> 01:28:19.659
I can't wait for the weekend

1056
01:28:19.868 --> 01:28:21.953
I can't wait for the weekend

1057
01:28:22.162 --> 01:28:24.247
I can't wait for the weekend

1058
01:28:24.456 --> 01:28:26.542
I can't wait for the weekend

1059
01:28:26.750 --> 01:28:28.836
I called Chad on Wednesday night

1060
01:28:28.836 --> 01:28:31.339
So we could make plans
for Thursday night


1061
01:28:31.339 --> 01:28:33.633
He said,
"We could go hit the Peapods"


1062
01:28:33.633 --> 01:28:35.927
I was like, "Yeah,
that's my favorite spot"


1063
01:28:35.927 --> 01:28:38.221
Plus, I like it there
'cause I got love on the list


1064
01:28:38.430 --> 01:28:40.515
The high-powered juice
where I don 't even get frisked


1065
01:28:40.515 --> 01:28:42.810
Walk up in the place
and get hugs from the misses


1066
01:28:43.018 --> 01:28:45.104
Pounds from my brothers
'cause they knowin ' that this is


1067
01:28:45.104 --> 01:28:47.189
The place to be
to let it all out

1068
01:28:47.189 --> 01:28:50.944
But when the weekend come,
the weekend come


1069
01:28:50.944 --> 01:28:54.281
Y'all could come, so go tell
your mama come and your papa come


1070
01:28:54.489 --> 01:28:56.575
Oh, they're spinnin' records
so we can get dumb


1071
01:28:56.783 --> 01:28:58.869
Place packed, capacity maximum

1072
01:28:59.078 --> 01:29:01.163
Due to my man Polo Promotion

1073
01:29:01.163 --> 01:29:03.874
And I can't wait
to go out and hear some


1074
01:29:03.874 --> 01:29:06.169
Jumpin' music

1075
01:29:06.169 --> 01:29:08.254
Swift DJ

1076
01:29:08.463 --> 01:29:13.051
Smoke machines and laser rays

1077
01:29:13.260 --> 01:29:17.848
Look out, weekend,
'cause here I come


1078
01:29:17.848 --> 01:29:22.019
Because weekends were, were

1079
01:29:22.228 --> 01:29:24.105
Walked in the club
at, like, ten o'clock


1080
01:29:24.314 --> 01:29:26.608
And the spot is hot,
blowing up rooftops


1081
01:29:26.608 --> 01:29:29.111
This is Thursday night
and the night is young


1082
01:29:29.111 --> 01:29:31.405
Four-day weekend,
time to have some fun


1083
01:29:31.405 --> 01:29:33.490
DJ scutter up, drop them joints

1084
01:29:33.490 --> 01:29:35.993
Everybody's been waitin '
to dance and make noise


1085
01:29:35.993 --> 01:29:38.079
B-boys,
let me see you break it down


1086
01:29:38.079 --> 01:29:40.373
And, ladies,
let your hips move around


1087
01:29:40.373 --> 01:29:42.667
To the sound of the BEP family

1088
01:29:42.667 --> 01:29:45.170
Got a poet named Life
and a sister Kimmy


1089
01:29:45.170 --> 01:29:47.464
- Word up
- And the blood of Abraham


1090
01:29:47.464 --> 01:29:49.967
- Word up
- So let's get ready for the jam


1091
01:29:49.967 --> 01:29:52.261
Jumpin' music

1092
01:29:52.261 --> 01:29:54.555
Swift DJ

1093
01:29:54.555 --> 01:29:59.352
Smoke machines and laser rays

1094
01:29:59.352 --> 01:30:03.941
Look out, weekend,
'cause I here I come


1095
01:30:03.941 --> 01:30:07.903
Because weekends were, were
