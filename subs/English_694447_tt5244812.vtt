1
00:00:43.099 --> 00:00:44.599
No ranch for sale no more!

2
00:00:45.734 --> 00:00:47.101
Can you believe we actually did
it?


3
00:00:47.103 --> 00:00:47.967
I know!

4
00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:48.903
Thank you girls for believing
in me.


5
00:00:50.772 --> 00:00:53.606
Ah, the air is so fresh
out here, it's so clean.


6
00:00:53.608 --> 00:00:54.676
There's so much of it.

7
00:00:55.744 --> 00:00:56.743
That's for sure.

8
00:00:56.745 --> 00:00:57.577
We're gonna be happy here.

9
00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:58.580
I know we will.

10
00:00:59.581 --> 00:01:00.813
Oh, hey!

11
00:01:00.815 --> 00:01:03.616
Let's take a picture.

12
00:01:03.618 --> 00:01:04.218
- All right.
- Okay.


13
00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:05.885
- Okay.
- Get the sign.


14
00:01:05.887 --> 00:01:07.354
- Get the sign.
- Yeah.


15
00:01:07.356 --> 00:01:09.589
- All right.
- Get the house, okay.


16
00:01:09.591 --> 00:01:12.094
One, two, three.

17
00:01:14.296 --> 00:01:15.795
Okay, let's do a goofy one.

18
00:01:15.797 --> 00:01:17.364
- All right.
- Okay, okay.


19
00:01:17.366 --> 00:01:18.332
Ready, timer.

20
00:01:18.334 --> 00:01:20.633
That's one
of my fondest memories.


21
00:01:20.635 --> 00:01:22.704
One of the happiest days of my
life.


22
00:01:24.206 --> 00:01:26.306
I couldn't believe it when
my parents sat me down


23
00:01:26.308 --> 00:01:28.142
and told me that they bought
this ranch


24
00:01:28.144 --> 00:01:30.610
and that we're moving to the
countryside,


25
00:01:30.612 --> 00:01:32.612
but I quickly fell in love with
it here


26
00:01:32.614 --> 00:01:35.750
and I can't see myself
living anywhere else.


27
00:01:45.294 --> 00:01:48.795
But then my dad deployed
and was killed in battle


28
00:01:48.797 --> 00:01:49.762
fighting for our country.

29
00:01:49.764 --> 00:01:51.731
I'm Chaplain Gonzales.

30
00:01:51.733 --> 00:01:53.933
We are here to regretfully
inform you that your.


31
00:01:53.935 --> 00:01:56.769
That day, our whole
world turned upside down.


32
00:02:06.182 --> 00:02:08.583
And everything quickly
went downhill after that.


33
00:02:36.445 --> 00:02:39.981
Pastor Williams always
preached hope and faith.


34
00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:43.983
My mom went to his church every
Sunday.


35
00:02:43.985 --> 00:02:45.653
She still had her hope.

36
00:02:46.888 --> 00:02:50.292
But when my dad died, I lost my
faith.


37
00:02:57.899 --> 00:03:00.034
Morning girl, did you miss me?

38
00:03:03.838 --> 00:03:07.041
I'd be so lost without
you.


39
00:03:13.047 --> 00:03:17.051
I think that means you'd
be lost without me too.


40
00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:23.392
You really like taking
care of her, don't you?


41
00:03:25.727 --> 00:03:28.062
I love it, I love her.

42
00:03:30.432 --> 00:03:34.434
Well, one day this will
all be yours to take care of.


43
00:03:34.436 --> 00:03:36.403
That's one of the reasons we
bought it


44
00:03:36.405 --> 00:03:38.072
was so we could pass it on to
you.


45
00:03:38.973 --> 00:03:41.676
I wish he was still here
to teach me what to do.


46
00:03:43.945 --> 00:03:45.914
I know, me too.

47
00:03:47.882 --> 00:03:50.718
But just remember, he believed
in you.


48
00:03:51.786 --> 00:03:52.588
And I do too.

49
00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.790
When the day comes, you'll know
exactly


50
00:03:57.792 --> 00:03:59.195
how to take care of it.

51
00:04:00.094 --> 00:04:01.095
I just know it.

52
00:04:08.304 --> 00:04:10.937
I remember when your dad
taught you how to ride her.


53
00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:12.372
I remember too.

54
00:04:12.374 --> 00:04:14.073
I was so afraid that first time

55
00:04:14.075 --> 00:04:15.475
I thought I was gonna hurt her.

56
00:04:15.477 --> 00:04:16.310
You weren't going to.

57
00:04:16.312 --> 00:04:17.979
Well, I know that now.

58
00:04:19.948 --> 00:04:21.950
She was the last thing Dad ever
gave me.


59
00:04:29.924 --> 00:04:32.191
Go on, I know you want to.

60
00:04:32.193 --> 00:04:33.092
I'll see you inside for lunch.

61
00:04:33.094 --> 00:04:34.095
Okay, good.

62
00:05:17.205 --> 00:05:20.873
You can open your eyes
now.


63
00:05:20.875 --> 00:05:21.876
Do you like her?

64
00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:27.383
She's breathtaking!

65
00:05:29.851 --> 00:05:30.785
Well go on, go on.

66
00:05:38.926 --> 00:05:40.560
Hey, here try this.

67
00:05:40.562 --> 00:05:42.529
Put your hand like this.

68
00:05:42.531 --> 00:05:44.364
What are we doing?

69
00:05:44.366 --> 00:05:46.868
What we're doing is called
a horseman's handshake.


70
00:05:47.902 --> 00:05:52.104
It is a very respectful
way to treat an animal


71
00:05:52.106 --> 00:05:54.909
and it's also a very polite
way to say good morning.


72
00:05:55.943 --> 00:05:56.976
Go ahead, try it.

73
00:05:56.978 --> 00:05:57.977
Good morning.

74
00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:00.347
See if she'll give you
permission to pet her.


75
00:06:00.349 --> 00:06:01.350
Hi there.

76
00:06:04.252 --> 00:06:06.653
Wow, looks like somebody's
got a new best friend.


77
00:06:21.969 --> 00:06:22.602
Hey.

78
00:06:22.604 --> 00:06:23.603
Hey Chris.

79
00:06:23.605 --> 00:06:26.005
You don't ever hear
your phone ring, do you?


80
00:06:26.007 --> 00:06:28.076
No, I've been riding.

81
00:06:29.143 --> 00:06:31.077
My sister's only a
few years older than us


82
00:06:31.079 --> 00:06:33.112
and she's never off of that
thing.


83
00:06:33.114 --> 00:06:35.014
I mean, she has to check it
every minute.


84
00:06:35.016 --> 00:06:36.248
My dad's always yelling at her.

85
00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:38.418
Yeah, I'd rather have
my hands on her reins


86
00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:39.421
than on my phone.

87
00:06:40.356 --> 00:06:43.923
So, I just thought I'd come
visit you.


88
00:06:43.925 --> 00:06:44.957
Just because we're not in school

89
00:06:44.959 --> 00:06:47.193
doesn't mean we can't hang out.

90
00:06:47.195 --> 00:06:50.096
Did you just come from
practice?


91
00:06:50.098 --> 00:06:52.998
Yeah, someone forgot to tell
Coach Davis


92
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.001
that we're on break.

93
00:06:55.671 --> 00:06:57.404
I guess that's what
happens when you decide


94
00:06:57.406 --> 00:06:59.006
to play football for the school.

95
00:07:00.274 --> 00:07:02.476
I still need the improvement
though,


96
00:07:02.478 --> 00:07:04.009
at least that's how I feel.

97
00:07:04.011 --> 00:07:05.277
What, come on.

98
00:07:05.279 --> 00:07:07.481
No way, I've seen you play.

99
00:07:07.483 --> 00:07:09.050
I think you're really good.

100
00:07:10.051 --> 00:07:12.320
I bet you'll be the star
running back in no time.


101
00:07:13.489 --> 00:07:15.622
- Hey!
- Hi.


102
00:07:15.624 --> 00:07:16.523
You need help?

103
00:07:16.525 --> 00:07:17.526
Sure.

104
00:07:21.129 --> 00:07:22.128
How's Chris?

105
00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:24.997
He's fine, he's coming
around again tomorrow.


106
00:07:24.999 --> 00:07:25.665
Really?

107
00:07:25.667 --> 00:07:26.668
What?

108
00:07:27.469 --> 00:07:29.034
He's cute.

109
00:07:29.036 --> 00:07:30.037
Mom!

110
00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:33.339
I'm right, aren't I?

111
00:07:33.341 --> 00:07:35.207
Stop!

112
00:07:35.209 --> 00:07:36.208
Do you like him?

113
00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:38.310
We are not talking about this.

114
00:07:38.312 --> 00:07:39.479
Why not?

115
00:07:39.481 --> 00:07:42.516
Seriously, sometimes it's
more like we're roommates.


116
00:07:42.518 --> 00:07:45.019
Well, so that you think.

117
00:07:47.623 --> 00:07:51.392
Actually, there is something
I wanted to talk to you about.


118
00:07:52.293 --> 00:07:55.062
Pastor Williams is gonna
come over for lunch today.


119
00:07:57.165 --> 00:07:59.165
He's only gonna talk about
church again.


120
00:07:59.167 --> 00:08:01.501
You haven't been since
your father passed.


121
00:08:01.503 --> 00:08:03.371
I don't want to go anymore.

122
00:08:06.207 --> 00:08:07.008
Why not?

123
00:08:07.743 --> 00:08:10.244
Mom, please don't pressure me.

124
00:08:11.547 --> 00:08:12.548
All right.

125
00:08:14.483 --> 00:08:16.150
But you can't avoid it forever.

126
00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:35.769
It looks beautiful, honey.

127
00:08:35.771 --> 00:08:37.269
Yes, I love all the colors,

128
00:08:37.271 --> 00:08:38.705
and how they shine in light.

129
00:08:38.707 --> 00:08:39.708
Right.

130
00:08:41.342 --> 00:08:43.543
So what do you think, honey?

131
00:08:43.545 --> 00:08:44.546
I think it's perfect.

132
00:08:45.514 --> 00:08:47.348
It's just perfect, that looks
great, Mike.


133
00:08:48.216 --> 00:08:50.149
You think God would approve?

134
00:08:50.151 --> 00:08:52.218
Well, Mike, God doesn't
micromanage.


135
00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:55.555
He leaves that up to me.

136
00:08:55.557 --> 00:08:56.756
No, it looks great.

137
00:08:56.758 --> 00:08:58.457
Look, I just wanna thank you
for everything you've done.


138
00:08:58.459 --> 00:08:59.458
Oh.

139
00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:00.560
No really, you're the
one that convinced me


140
00:09:00.562 --> 00:09:03.095
to move out here, you found
this historical building


141
00:09:03.097 --> 00:09:04.531
and you restored it
with your own two hands.


142
00:09:04.533 --> 00:09:06.232
Man, that's big time.

143
00:09:06.234 --> 00:09:08.200
Now, I know we've been
friends for a long time, Mike,


144
00:09:08.202 --> 00:09:10.135
but you went above and beyond,
man.


145
00:09:10.137 --> 00:09:11.638
You would have done exactly
the same thing for me.


146
00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:13.405
- You know I would.
- Yeah.


147
00:09:13.407 --> 00:09:16.275
- You know I would.
- Come here you.


148
00:09:16.277 --> 00:09:18.477
Well now we just need a
congregation.


149
00:09:18.479 --> 00:09:19.178
You know what they say,

150
00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:21.247
if you build it they will come.

151
00:09:21.249 --> 00:09:22.414
Let's hope, let's
hope.


152
00:09:22.416 --> 00:09:25.217
And if you paint it, they
will most assuredly come.


153
00:09:25.219 --> 00:09:26.452
Absolutely.

154
00:09:26.454 --> 00:09:27.455
Now you see.

155
00:09:28.356 --> 00:09:31.490
Way up there where it comes
together.


156
00:09:31.492 --> 00:09:32.559
For the paint?

157
00:09:32.561 --> 00:09:36.565
No no no, bright lights,
I can't get up there.


158
00:09:51.178 --> 00:09:53.114
Why are you avoiding Pastor
Williams?


159
00:09:56.217 --> 00:09:59.318
Because every time I see him

160
00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:01.188
I can only picture Dad's
funeral.


161
00:10:03.357 --> 00:10:04.358
Oh Grace.

162
00:10:05.561 --> 00:10:08.193
I just don't believe any more,
Mom.


163
00:10:08.195 --> 00:10:09.330
Don't say that.

164
00:10:10.531 --> 00:10:12.264
What's the point in prayer

165
00:10:12.266 --> 00:10:14.366
if I don't believe in the words?

166
00:10:27.214 --> 00:10:30.384
You know, your dad is still
with us.


167
00:10:34.288 --> 00:10:36.257
He's always going to be here.

168
00:10:41.195 --> 00:10:42.596
I still feel like I'm waiting
for him


169
00:10:42.598 --> 00:10:43.765
to walk through my door.

170
00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:48.502
Like any second it's gonna
happen.


171
00:10:51.673 --> 00:10:52.808
But it just never does.

172
00:11:02.516 --> 00:11:03.517
I know.

173
00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:13.327
And that's why we have to
stay strong for each other,


174
00:11:15.229 --> 00:11:17.264
so that we can get through this
together.


175
00:11:30.311 --> 00:11:32.244
Rebecca, how you doing?

176
00:11:32.246 --> 00:11:33.247
How's Grace?

177
00:11:36.517 --> 00:11:38.450
She's, she's okay.

178
00:11:38.452 --> 00:11:40.887
- Yeah?
- Considering everything.


179
00:11:40.889 --> 00:11:42.789
You know I think about you
guys a lot.


180
00:11:42.791 --> 00:11:45.226
Haven't seen her since the
funeral.


181
00:11:46.394 --> 00:11:49.363
I feel like after everything
your family has done for me,


182
00:11:50.966 --> 00:11:52.166
I owe you guys.

183
00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:57.304
I mean, the fact is,
without his hard work,


184
00:11:58.606 --> 00:12:00.674
this town wouldn't even have a
church.


185
00:12:00.676 --> 00:12:02.343
I wouldn't have this house.

186
00:12:04.946 --> 00:12:09.951
But the truth is, we're about to
lose it.


187
00:12:10.919 --> 00:12:12.484
What?

188
00:12:12.486 --> 00:12:14.319
Well, you know how I
sold all the cattle off?


189
00:12:14.321 --> 00:12:16.455
Yeah.

190
00:12:16.457 --> 00:12:18.292
Mike had become a really good
rancher.


191
00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:21.795
I tried my hardest to do all of
that stuff


192
00:12:21.797 --> 00:12:24.329
and I just couldn't keep up with
that


193
00:12:24.331 --> 00:12:26.498
and with taking care of
my daughter all on my own.


194
00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:28.333
You shouldn't have to.

195
00:12:28.335 --> 00:12:29.905
That's too much for any one
person.


196
00:12:30.772 --> 00:12:32.471
And Grace doesn't even know.

197
00:13:47.581 --> 00:13:49.849
So how was my husband when
you two served together?


198
00:13:49.851 --> 00:13:51.550
Who, Mike?

199
00:13:51.552 --> 00:13:52.586
It was funny.

200
00:13:53.855 --> 00:13:54.720
Marginally.

201
00:13:54.722 --> 00:13:56.455
Yeah, Mike was great.

202
00:13:56.457 --> 00:13:57.322
Well, wait a minute.

203
00:13:57.324 --> 00:13:58.524
I don't wanna blow his big old
head up


204
00:13:58.526 --> 00:14:00.626
any bigger than it already is.

205
00:14:00.628 --> 00:14:02.427
No Mike, Mike was awesome.

206
00:14:02.429 --> 00:14:04.898
Mike was awesome, he was a great
sergeant.


207
00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:05.901
Guys loved him.

208
00:14:06.935 --> 00:14:08.400
They'd run through a wall for
him,


209
00:14:08.402 --> 00:14:09.568
take a bullet for the guy.

210
00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:11.603
I think we all would.

211
00:14:11.605 --> 00:14:12.872
That is not how you
used to talk about me


212
00:14:12.874 --> 00:14:15.474
when I was giving you orders, my
friend.


213
00:14:15.476 --> 00:14:16.876
No, no, not at all.

214
00:14:16.878 --> 00:14:18.477
You weren't talking about me
like that


215
00:14:18.479 --> 00:14:20.579
when I was telling you
to do 20 more pushups.


216
00:14:20.581 --> 00:14:21.580
And I was there.

217
00:14:21.582 --> 00:14:23.549
It almost made me quit.

218
00:14:23.551 --> 00:14:25.450
Is that what made you
ditch a rifle for a Bible?


219
00:14:25.452 --> 00:14:28.420
No, I was long gone when I
started


220
00:14:28.422 --> 00:14:29.956
to really work on my faith.

221
00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:30.959
I had left the Army.

222
00:14:32.593 --> 00:14:33.594
Then I came back.

223
00:14:34.628 --> 00:14:38.066
Just not as a soldier this
time, but as a pastor.


224
00:14:39.633 --> 00:14:42.570
And he served his country
proud, in both ways.


225
00:14:44.605 --> 00:14:45.637
Thanks, sweetie.

226
00:14:45.639 --> 00:14:46.973
You always had a knack.

227
00:14:46.975 --> 00:14:49.142
My men revered you, they
would open up to you,


228
00:14:49.144 --> 00:14:50.809
tell you their dreams, their
hopes,


229
00:14:50.811 --> 00:14:52.111
they'd confess everything to
you.


230
00:14:52.113 --> 00:14:54.479
Not to me, just you, naturally.

231
00:14:54.481 --> 00:14:56.750
Nah, they was just
sacred of the Lord, man.


232
00:14:57.986 --> 00:14:59.855
It was like confession a lot of
times.


233
00:15:03.424 --> 00:15:04.425
That being said,

234
00:15:06.493 --> 00:15:08.362
anything you wanna confess,
Mike?


235
00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:10.899
Now's a good a time as any.

236
00:15:11.765 --> 00:15:13.534
Well, now that you mention it,

237
00:15:17.538 --> 00:15:20.539
I've been called and asked

238
00:15:20.541 --> 00:15:23.642
to go back and do another tour
of duty.


239
00:15:23.644 --> 00:15:24.445
Really?

240
00:15:25.546 --> 00:15:26.547
Really.

241
00:15:27.514 --> 00:15:28.616
You okay with that?

242
00:15:30.886 --> 00:15:32.988
Well, I can't tell him not to
go, but...


243
00:15:36.624 --> 00:15:38.026
You're afraid, it's okay.

244
00:15:40.228 --> 00:15:43.595
I mean, if I were in your
position I'd be afraid too.


245
00:15:43.597 --> 00:15:45.198
You know that I don't
wanna leave you and Grace


246
00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:48.634
for 10 minutes, let
alone months at a time,


247
00:15:48.636 --> 00:15:53.407
but I just don't, I don't
see any way I could say no.


248
00:15:54.808 --> 00:15:56.142
I don't like my men, they need
me.


249
00:15:56.144 --> 00:16:00.612
My country needs me.

250
00:16:23.871 --> 00:16:25.539
Hey Grace.

251
00:16:35.549 --> 00:16:36.748
That wasn't funny.

252
00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:37.716
You're right, you're
right, you're right,


253
00:16:37.718 --> 00:16:39.285
it wasn't funny.

254
00:16:39.287 --> 00:16:41.653
It was hysterical.

255
00:16:41.655 --> 00:16:43.855
Best part was you scream
like a little girl.


256
00:16:43.857 --> 00:16:45.191
Did not!

257
00:16:45.193 --> 00:16:46.194
You totally did.

258
00:16:47.728 --> 00:16:49.262
How's Faith doing?

259
00:16:49.264 --> 00:16:50.464
She's great.

260
00:16:51.732 --> 00:16:53.099
Well, I'm sure that's just
because


261
00:16:53.101 --> 00:16:55.236
she gets to spend all
of her time with you.


262
00:16:57.638 --> 00:16:59.671
I still have some
work that I need to do,


263
00:16:59.673 --> 00:17:01.873
but do you wanna help me?

264
00:17:01.875 --> 00:17:03.242
I'd love to.

265
00:17:03.244 --> 00:17:05.246
Great, I think you'll really
enjoy it.


266
00:17:14.089 --> 00:17:17.991
How'd I let you to
convince me to do this again?


267
00:17:17.993 --> 00:17:19.925
Well usually I'd get my mom to
help me,


268
00:17:19.927 --> 00:17:22.998
but you said you wanted to
spend more time with me, so.


269
00:17:25.066 --> 00:17:27.899
Yeah, this isn't exactly
what I had in mind.


270
00:17:38.779 --> 00:17:40.679
So why'd you name her Faith?

271
00:17:40.681 --> 00:17:42.750
I didn't, my Dad named her.

272
00:17:45.186 --> 00:17:46.187
I like it.

273
00:17:47.821 --> 00:17:50.655
Yeah, it's okay I guess.

274
00:17:50.657 --> 00:17:51.792
Why just okay?

275
00:17:52.826 --> 00:17:54.760
'Cause to be honest, I just
don't know


276
00:17:54.762 --> 00:17:56.962
if I have it anymore.

277
00:17:56.964 --> 00:17:58.133
What, faith?

278
00:18:00.268 --> 00:18:02.801
Hey, don't say that, okay.

279
00:18:02.803 --> 00:18:04.705
You're gonna get through
these tough times.


280
00:18:34.034 --> 00:18:36.868
Mrs. Evans, this is
Ben Clark from the bank again.


281
00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:38.904
We urgently need to talk.

282
00:18:38.906 --> 00:18:42.241
As you are aware from
your foreclosure notice.


283
00:19:40.468 --> 00:19:42.100
Rebecca, how you doing?

284
00:19:42.102 --> 00:19:43.935
Hi, am I bothering
you?


285
00:19:43.937 --> 00:19:45.070
Oh no, it's no bother at all.

286
00:19:45.072 --> 00:19:46.405
Sandra's off running errands

287
00:19:46.407 --> 00:19:48.940
and I'm just up here working on
a sermon.


288
00:19:48.942 --> 00:19:51.177
I sure could use a sneak peak
right now.


289
00:19:51.179 --> 00:19:53.346
Oh no, you know I can't do
that.


290
00:19:53.348 --> 00:19:54.848
That'd just ruin the surprise.

291
00:19:57.218 --> 00:19:58.317
You know what, come on up here.

292
00:19:58.319 --> 00:20:00.954
Let's have a chat.

293
00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:14.835
Tell me what's wrong.

294
00:20:18.005 --> 00:20:20.506
The bank's about to foreclose
on us.


295
00:20:20.508 --> 00:20:22.275
Okay but you can't give up.

296
00:20:22.277 --> 00:20:24.179
I don't know if I have the
strength.


297
00:20:25.913 --> 00:20:27.315
You're being tested right now.

298
00:20:28.849 --> 00:20:30.684
But it's gonna make you
stronger.


299
00:20:32.152 --> 00:20:35.521
You're gonna get through,
trust me when I tell you this,


300
00:20:35.523 --> 00:20:37.989
you're gonna come out stronger.

301
00:20:37.991 --> 00:20:39.159
You're gonna get through it.

302
00:20:42.497 --> 00:20:44.199
But you gotta believe that.

303
00:20:50.003 --> 00:20:51.306
Have you prayed about it?

304
00:20:54.275 --> 00:20:56.141
Yes, yes I've prayed, but I
just,


305
00:20:56.143 --> 00:20:57.376
I feel like god's not even...

306
00:20:57.378 --> 00:20:59.878
Rebecca, he's listening to
you.


307
00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:01.349
I know you don't think he is,

308
00:21:03.050 --> 00:21:04.352
but he's listening to you.

309
00:21:06.053 --> 00:21:08.223
The thing is, are you listening
to him?


310
00:21:09.224 --> 00:21:12.791
'Cause he hopes you are so
you'll be able to respond


311
00:21:12.793 --> 00:21:13.794
when he answers.

312
00:21:15.563 --> 00:21:18.065
Remember the two virtues
that I preach on a lot.


313
00:21:19.467 --> 00:21:20.700
Hope and faith.

314
00:21:20.702 --> 00:21:24.503
See when people get in tough
times, like you are right now,


315
00:21:24.505 --> 00:21:27.138
that seems impossible and you
wanna quit,


316
00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:29.007
when it's not easy, when it's
rough,


317
00:21:29.009 --> 00:21:30.311
that's when you need it the
most.


318
00:21:31.579 --> 00:21:32.846
Not the time to quit.

319
00:21:34.014 --> 00:21:34.982
It's time to fight.

320
00:21:37.150 --> 00:21:39.084
Through hope and faith you can
do that


321
00:21:39.086 --> 00:21:40.053
and you're gonna do it.

322
00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:44.259
You need to fight for your hope,

323
00:21:45.225 --> 00:21:47.360
I believe you wanna fight for
your hope


324
00:21:47.362 --> 00:21:51.299
and not just for yourself, but
for Grace.


325
00:21:55.068 --> 00:21:55.969
Y'all both gotta fight.

326
00:21:57.137 --> 00:21:59.006
'Cause let me tell you right
now,


327
00:22:00.173 --> 00:22:04.878
Rebecca, if you're not willing
to fight,


328
00:22:08.915 --> 00:22:10.181
no one else will.

329
00:22:39.514 --> 00:22:41.946
I can see why your
parents wanted to move here.


330
00:22:41.948 --> 00:22:44.151
I know, I love it here.

331
00:22:45.952 --> 00:22:46.920
What about your place?

332
00:22:48.389 --> 00:22:51.490
Um, I grew up on my farm,

333
00:22:51.492 --> 00:22:53.126
it's all I've ever known really.

334
00:22:54.294 --> 00:22:57.028
Do you wanna be a
farmer?


335
00:22:57.030 --> 00:22:58.163
Yeah.

336
00:22:58.165 --> 00:22:58.965
Yeah, I guess I do.

337
00:23:00.335 --> 00:23:02.269
Once my dad retires it'll all be
mine.


338
00:23:04.004 --> 00:23:04.938
What about football?

339
00:23:07.307 --> 00:23:08.006
I don't know, everyone's
always telling me


340
00:23:08.008 --> 00:23:10.008
how good I am
at it, but I mean,

341
00:23:10.010 --> 00:23:12.212
I guess the farm has to come
first.


342
00:23:14.214 --> 00:23:15.949
Maybe you can do both.

343
00:23:18.151 --> 00:23:19.019
Yeah, I'd like that.

344
00:23:21.154 --> 00:23:23.356
My mom wants me to
run this place one day.


345
00:23:23.358 --> 00:23:25.056
And I don't mind the hard work,

346
00:23:25.058 --> 00:23:27.362
but I don't know if I can do it
alone.


347
00:23:29.129 --> 00:23:32.165
The only thing I'm afraid
of is letting my dad down.


348
00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:34.901
I think you'll do just fine.

349
00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:38.071
Will you help me?

350
00:23:39.139 --> 00:23:41.005
Do you want me to?

351
00:23:41.007 --> 00:23:42.075
What do you think?

352
00:23:51.552 --> 00:23:52.553
Hi.

353
00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:55.019
How are your parents?

354
00:23:55.021 --> 00:23:56.054
They're good.

355
00:23:56.056 --> 00:23:57.956
Grace keeping you busy,
putting you to work?


356
00:23:57.958 --> 00:24:00.225
Yeah, she is but I'm having
fun.


357
00:24:00.227 --> 00:24:02.595
That's good, are you hungry?

358
00:24:02.597 --> 00:24:03.496
A little.

359
00:24:03.498 --> 00:24:05.096
Okay, well I just made an
apple pie


360
00:24:05.098 --> 00:24:06.998
if you wanna go in and grab a
slice.


361
00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:07.932
Awesome.

362
00:24:07.934 --> 00:24:08.701
All right, we'll see you
inside, okay?


363
00:24:08.703 --> 00:24:10.370
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.


364
00:24:14.141 --> 00:24:14.973
Hey sweetie.

365
00:24:14.975 --> 00:24:15.976
Hi.

366
00:24:18.211 --> 00:24:21.079
Can I talk to you for a
second?


367
00:24:21.081 --> 00:24:23.350
Yeah, is it about that sign I
saw?


368
00:24:24.419 --> 00:24:25.420
Yeah.

369
00:24:27.755 --> 00:24:31.289
So we're gonna have an
estate sale on Saturday.


370
00:24:31.291 --> 00:24:32.123
Okay.

371
00:24:32.125 --> 00:24:34.058
So anything that you don't
need,


372
00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:37.262
I'd like for you to go
ahead and box it up today


373
00:24:37.264 --> 00:24:39.230
and I'll be doing the same
thing.


374
00:24:39.232 --> 00:24:41.268
I don't get it to, why is it
so urgent?


375
00:24:50.611 --> 00:24:51.679
We're broke, Grace.

376
00:24:54.114 --> 00:24:55.115
What?

377
00:24:56.183 --> 00:24:58.383
The ranch is in a lot of debt

378
00:24:58.385 --> 00:25:03.087
and if we don't come up
with some money soon.


379
00:25:03.089 --> 00:25:04.057
Are you serious?

380
00:25:06.092 --> 00:25:11.097
Well, we haven't had
any income coming in


381
00:25:11.799 --> 00:25:14.399
and we've still had to make
all the mortgage payments,


382
00:25:14.401 --> 00:25:17.402
pay all the expenses, cover
the cost of the cattle and...


383
00:25:17.404 --> 00:25:19.738
But we already sold off all
the cattle.


384
00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:22.242
Yeah, but I had to sell
them under market value.


385
00:25:23.343 --> 00:25:25.480
It stopped the bleeding for a
bit, but.


386
00:25:31.652 --> 00:25:33.220
You like it here, don't you?

387
00:25:36.323 --> 00:25:39.123
Do you remember what it was
like before we came here?


388
00:25:39.125 --> 00:25:40.126
Yeah.

389
00:25:41.529 --> 00:25:45.129
Yeah, a two bedroom
apartment in the city.


390
00:25:45.131 --> 00:25:47.200
Your dad and I working all the
time.


391
00:25:49.537 --> 00:25:53.806
Didn't leave much time for us as
a family.


392
00:25:53.808 --> 00:25:54.842
I remember, Mom.

393
00:25:57.210 --> 00:25:59.778
Things got a lot better
for us when we got here.


394
00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:00.781
I know.

395
00:26:02.249 --> 00:26:03.450
I love it here, Grace.

396
00:26:04.451 --> 00:26:05.452
I do too.

397
00:26:08.856 --> 00:26:10.357
That's why I need your help,

398
00:26:12.459 --> 00:26:14.194
so that we don't lose it, okay.

399
00:26:15.161 --> 00:26:16.162
Okay.

400
00:26:19.332 --> 00:26:20.398
Hey.

401
00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:22.635
You don't need to go home
any time soon, do you?


402
00:26:22.637 --> 00:26:23.569
No, why?

403
00:26:23.571 --> 00:26:24.572
I need your help.

404
00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:26.639
Okay, I'm all yours.

405
00:26:26.641 --> 00:26:28.106
Great, follow me.

406
00:26:28.108 --> 00:26:29.209
Okay, coming.

407
00:27:06.346 --> 00:27:08.413
You sure have a lot of books.

408
00:27:08.415 --> 00:27:09.547
Yeah, I love to read.

409
00:27:09.549 --> 00:27:10.550
What about you?

410
00:27:13.253 --> 00:27:15.286
If it's a good enough book
someone's gonna make a movie


411
00:27:15.288 --> 00:27:18.389
about it, so why bother to read
it?


412
00:27:18.391 --> 00:27:20.224
'Cause it's fun to.

413
00:27:20.226 --> 00:27:21.227
I don't know.

414
00:27:24.464 --> 00:27:27.233
So you really have to
get rid of everything?


415
00:27:28.335 --> 00:27:30.201
Yeah, I guess most of this
stuff


416
00:27:30.203 --> 00:27:32.370
is from when I was a kid anyway.

417
00:27:32.372 --> 00:27:33.939
What about you, I'm sure your
room is full


418
00:27:33.941 --> 00:27:35.575
of stuff you don't need anymore.

419
00:27:36.944 --> 00:27:38.010
Not really, actually.

420
00:27:38.012 --> 00:27:40.278
I mean, I grew up on a
farm so my parent's ideas


421
00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:43.649
of gifts were stuff that
the farm also needed.


422
00:27:43.651 --> 00:27:44.750
Like what?

423
00:27:44.752 --> 00:27:45.786
Tools, mostly.

424
00:27:47.554 --> 00:27:50.455
Although, one year I did get a
tractor.


425
00:27:50.457 --> 00:27:51.790
That's pretty cool.

426
00:27:51.792 --> 00:27:53.591
Yeah, I thought it was
the coolest gift ever too,


427
00:27:53.593 --> 00:27:56.962
until my dad said I couldn't
ride it until I was 15.


428
00:27:56.964 --> 00:27:59.464
Well, at least it's
something you can use now


429
00:27:59.466 --> 00:28:00.500
and for years to come.

430
00:28:02.335 --> 00:28:04.772
Like you said, you're gonna
stay on the farm, right?


431
00:28:06.206 --> 00:28:09.842
Yeah, yeah I'm definitely a
country kid.


432
00:28:09.844 --> 00:28:12.443
Wouldn't know what to do
with myself in the city.


433
00:28:12.445 --> 00:28:14.345
Did you know I'm from the
city?


434
00:28:14.347 --> 00:28:16.782
Yeah, I did.

435
00:28:16.784 --> 00:28:18.418
Do you ever wanna go back
there?


436
00:28:19.687 --> 00:28:22.355
No, no I love it here way too
much.


437
00:28:23.223 --> 00:28:25.660
Good, I'm really glad you said
that.


438
00:28:26.626 --> 00:28:28.827
Yeah, I'm not going anywhere.

439
00:28:28.829 --> 00:28:31.631
Besides, I wouldn't be able
to take Faith into the city.


440
00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:37.468
You know, if Faith was my
horse,


441
00:28:37.470 --> 00:28:38.638
I wouldn't leave her either.

442
00:28:46.714 --> 00:28:48.346
Hopefully a bunch of people
see this


443
00:28:48.348 --> 00:28:50.348
and we'll take these,
hit the neighborhoods.


444
00:28:50.350 --> 00:28:52.517
Y'all just come on in,
everybody come on and grab one


445
00:28:52.519 --> 00:28:54.552
and I'll give everybody one of
these,


446
00:28:54.554 --> 00:28:55.520
we'll get it done, all right.

447
00:28:55.522 --> 00:28:57.255
Let's just kind of just
spread out all over


448
00:28:57.257 --> 00:28:58.791
and let's just floor the
neighborhood.


449
00:28:58.793 --> 00:29:00.859
Some of you go that way,
some of you come with me.


450
00:29:00.861 --> 00:29:03.696
And big smiles, big smiles,
let's go, all right.


451
00:29:03.698 --> 00:29:05.331
- Let's get it done.
- All right.


452
00:29:08.002 --> 00:29:09.400
How is it?

453
00:29:09.402 --> 00:29:11.404
Um, can I talk to you?

454
00:29:13.339 --> 00:29:14.340
What now?

455
00:29:15.341 --> 00:29:17.677
Just come downstairs
with me for a sec, okay.


456
00:29:32.592 --> 00:29:33.861
What are you doing?

457
00:29:35.428 --> 00:29:36.427
I wanted to see if there was
anything


458
00:29:36.429 --> 00:29:37.763
you wanted to keep before...

459
00:29:37.765 --> 00:29:38.764
Mom!

460
00:29:38.766 --> 00:29:40.065
Look, you know we have
to get rid of everything


461
00:29:40.067 --> 00:29:41.066
that we don't need.

462
00:29:41.068 --> 00:29:42.868
But this is Dad's stuff.

463
00:29:42.870 --> 00:29:45.436
And I realize that this
isn't gonna be easy for you.


464
00:29:45.438 --> 00:29:47.407
No, it's not, why should it
be?


465
00:29:51.678 --> 00:29:54.949
I'm only doing this because
I have no other choice here.


466
00:29:56.716 --> 00:29:58.551
Not Dad's stuff, please.

467
00:30:01.088 --> 00:30:02.288
I'm sorry.

468
00:30:03.356 --> 00:30:04.524
But we have to.

469
00:30:06.894 --> 00:30:08.461
I can't believe this.

470
00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.435
Did you know that when
I first met your father


471
00:30:17.604 --> 00:30:19.537
he had nothing?

472
00:30:19.539 --> 00:30:21.840
I had just come back from
college to see my mom


473
00:30:21.842 --> 00:30:26.847
and there he was, outside
the train station.


474
00:30:30.050 --> 00:30:31.449
I had to wait for my ride to
turn up


475
00:30:31.451 --> 00:30:33.788
and so I just sat there watching
this guy.


476
00:30:34.889 --> 00:30:38.358
Just tell bad jokes and

477
00:30:41.561 --> 00:30:44.430
doing his best to raise
money for a good cause.


478
00:30:50.805 --> 00:30:52.004
He was a little older than me,

479
00:30:52.006 --> 00:30:56.342
he had scruff on his
face and his sweatshirt


480
00:30:58.645 --> 00:30:59.445
and ripped jeans.

481
00:31:02.682 --> 00:31:03.550
But he was adorable.

482
00:31:05.953 --> 00:31:08.454
But just in need of a
woman's touch, you know?


483
00:31:10.991 --> 00:31:11.992
He smiled at me

484
00:31:14.761 --> 00:31:15.762
and I smiled back.

485
00:31:18.498 --> 00:31:20.700
And then we started
talking it was just like


486
00:31:22.569 --> 00:31:24.802
we had known each other forever,

487
00:31:24.804 --> 00:31:26.706
even though we had literally
just met.


488
00:31:30.643 --> 00:31:32.412
And that was the moment we knew.

489
00:31:48.595 --> 00:31:52.565
Your dad gave this to me
on our first anniversary.


490
00:31:54.034 --> 00:31:55.302
Together forever.

491
00:31:59.173 --> 00:32:03.443
This is what's important to
keep, okay.


492
00:32:08.182 --> 00:32:10.617
That way all you have to do

493
00:32:13.087 --> 00:32:16.556
is look down to remember how
much we both loved each other


494
00:32:17.624 --> 00:32:19.026
and how much we love you.

495
00:32:27.935 --> 00:32:29.700
You know your dad would
have wanted us to do


496
00:32:29.702 --> 00:32:31.535
whatever it takes to keep this
ranch.


497
00:32:31.537 --> 00:32:32.538
I know.

498
00:32:33.740 --> 00:32:35.606
That's why we have to sell
things now


499
00:32:35.608 --> 00:32:36.942
before we're forced to sell
things


500
00:32:36.944 --> 00:32:39.079
that we don't wanna sell.

501
00:32:41.514 --> 00:32:42.515
What do you mean?

502
00:32:43.483 --> 00:32:47.553
It's the last thing
that I would want to do.


503
00:32:48.755 --> 00:32:52.993
No, no you don't mean Faith.

504
00:32:54.929 --> 00:32:56.962
I hope it never has to come to
that.


505
00:32:56.964 --> 00:32:59.630
It'll never come to that!

506
00:32:59.632 --> 00:33:00.566
Do you hear me, never!

507
00:33:10.610 --> 00:33:11.544
Hey, what's wrong?

508
00:33:12.779 --> 00:33:13.412
Is everything okay?

509
00:33:13.414 --> 00:33:15.049
Just come with me, okay?

510
00:33:17.850 --> 00:33:19.817
This is Ben Clark again,

511
00:33:19.819 --> 00:33:23.088
I can't stress enough how
urgent it is that we speak.


512
00:33:23.090 --> 00:33:25.856
As you are aware from
your foreclosure notice,


513
00:33:25.858 --> 00:33:28.726
you don't have much time until
the bank


514
00:33:28.728 --> 00:33:30.561
takes possession of your
property.


515
00:33:30.563 --> 00:33:32.830
So please call me back.

516
00:33:32.832 --> 00:33:35.568
You have both my office
and cell phone numbers.


517
00:33:40.274 --> 00:33:42.642
I feel like we say
goodbye a million times.


518
00:33:43.943 --> 00:33:44.944
Right.

519
00:33:47.181 --> 00:33:49.780
She's having a really
hard time with this.


520
00:33:49.782 --> 00:33:50.881
Yeah, I know.

521
00:33:50.883 --> 00:33:53.653
She'll be okay, our big girl.

522
00:33:56.290 --> 00:33:57.992
I wanna make you both proud of
me.


523
00:33:59.559 --> 00:34:00.860
I know you will.

524
00:34:07.867 --> 00:34:08.668
Hey, oh!

525
00:34:11.738 --> 00:34:14.074
Oh, you two, you two are
something else.


526
00:34:15.708 --> 00:34:19.844
While I'm gone, I know it's
not always going to be easy,


527
00:34:19.846 --> 00:34:23.017
but I know that you can handle
it.


528
00:34:25.718 --> 00:34:28.853
All I want you to do is do your
best,


529
00:34:28.855 --> 00:34:33.091
that's all anybody can ask.

530
00:34:33.093 --> 00:34:34.794
Dad, I'm gonna miss you so
much.


531
00:34:37.730 --> 00:34:41.168
I already miss you two more
than you can possibly imagine.


532
00:34:45.339 --> 00:34:50.543
But when you close your
eyes, I'll be there.


533
00:34:59.819 --> 00:35:02.853
I'm never gonna let you go.

534
00:35:02.855 --> 00:35:04.791
No one will ever take you from
me.


535
00:35:09.396 --> 00:35:11.265
I don't know what I'd do without
you.


536
00:35:14.801 --> 00:35:16.801
So what's it like to ride her?

537
00:35:16.803 --> 00:35:18.838
You've never ridden a horse
before?


538
00:35:19.806 --> 00:35:23.243
When I ride her I feel free.

539
00:35:24.111 --> 00:35:26.246
I just feel so happy and alive.

540
00:35:31.918 --> 00:35:33.287
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.


541
00:35:42.929 --> 00:35:44.964
You two look great together.

542
00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:49.802
I mean, she's such a pretty
horse and...


543
00:35:51.338 --> 00:35:52.339
And?

544
00:35:54.374 --> 00:35:55.975
And you're such a pretty girl.

545
00:35:58.878 --> 00:36:01.446
I mean, there's a reason I
avoided even making eye contact


546
00:36:01.448 --> 00:36:03.714
with you the first few years of
school.


547
00:36:03.716 --> 00:36:04.717
What's that?

548
00:36:06.953 --> 00:36:08.786
I don't know, I can't explain
it.


549
00:36:08.788 --> 00:36:12.957
It's like I felt sick just
looking at you.


550
00:36:12.959 --> 00:36:14.259
Gee, thanks.

551
00:36:14.261 --> 00:36:16.929
No, I don't mean it
like that, it's just,


552
00:36:18.798 --> 00:36:21.901
you know, you were the
prettiest girl in school.


553
00:36:22.869 --> 00:36:23.870
I was scared.

554
00:36:25.738 --> 00:36:28.808
I was afraid that if I
tried to talk to you,


555
00:36:30.910 --> 00:36:31.944
you'd just walk away.

556
00:36:33.413 --> 00:36:34.912
I mean, if you did that I
wouldn't be able


557
00:36:34.914 --> 00:36:36.048
to stay at school anymore.

558
00:36:37.217 --> 00:36:38.416
Well it's good thing I spoke
to you


559
00:36:38.418 --> 00:36:41.654
that day you finally approached
me at the water fountain.


560
00:36:42.356 --> 00:36:43.357
You remember that?

561
00:36:48.027 --> 00:36:49.896
So you've really never ridden
a horse?


562
00:36:51.465 --> 00:36:52.798
Actually, I have not, no.

563
00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:56.068
Everyone says riding is so much
fun, but.


564
00:36:57.904 --> 00:36:59.904
Well, how about I teach you?

565
00:36:59.906 --> 00:37:02.374
I don't know, it took me long
enough


566
00:37:02.376 --> 00:37:04.176
to learn how to ride my bike.

567
00:37:04.178 --> 00:37:05.776
Come on, trust me.

568
00:37:05.778 --> 00:37:07.780
Let me help you out with
something too.


569
00:37:09.815 --> 00:37:12.952
Squeezing is like a gas
pedal, it means go fast.


570
00:37:13.886 --> 00:37:17.087
So the harder you squeeze,
not with your here,


571
00:37:17.089 --> 00:37:19.926
but with your heels, the
faster the horse will go.


572
00:37:21.228 --> 00:37:23.328
So a lot of times you'll be
thinking,


573
00:37:23.330 --> 00:37:24.929
I wanna slow down, I wanna slow
down,


574
00:37:24.931 --> 00:37:27.031
but you're telling the horse
yah.


575
00:37:27.033 --> 00:37:28.933
So here watch, we just go, I
know, right.


576
00:37:28.935 --> 00:37:30.204
So there's a lot to know.

577
00:37:31.205 --> 00:37:32.872
But it's all very easy, see.

578
00:37:35.908 --> 00:37:37.009
Very easy.

579
00:37:42.449 --> 00:37:47.051
So what you practice are
figure eights, right.


580
00:37:47.053 --> 00:37:50.422
Here's a figure eight, now
look how little I have to do.


581
00:37:50.424 --> 00:37:52.326
Not scary, right?

582
00:37:54.961 --> 00:37:56.396
You look like you're scared.

583
00:37:57.830 --> 00:37:58.963
Touch her again.

584
00:37:58.965 --> 00:38:02.833
You have to believe in your
horse.


585
00:38:02.835 --> 00:38:04.271
You have to believe in yourself,

586
00:38:06.373 --> 00:38:09.541
and you have to trust me, all
right?


587
00:38:09.543 --> 00:38:10.743
Okay.

588
00:38:20.086 --> 00:38:22.454
See, just like riding a bike.

589
00:38:22.456 --> 00:38:25.856
If the bike had a mind of its
own.


590
00:38:25.858 --> 00:38:28.360
Come on.

591
00:38:28.362 --> 00:38:29.363
Come on.

592
00:38:31.130 --> 00:38:32.530
- Dad?
- Come on, come on,


593
00:38:32.532 --> 00:38:34.131
come on, come on, come here.

594
00:38:34.133 --> 00:38:36.168
Look it's okay, listen to me.

595
00:38:37.604 --> 00:38:38.871
Listen to me.

596
00:38:39.839 --> 00:38:41.038
You trust me, right?

597
00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:41.874
Yeah.

598
00:38:43.042 --> 00:38:45.044
Okay, you trust me, you trust
Faith,


599
00:38:46.112 --> 00:38:48.348
you trust yourself, you got
this.


600
00:38:50.016 --> 00:38:51.048
- You got this.
- Okay.


601
00:38:51.050 --> 00:38:51.915
Okay.

602
00:38:51.917 --> 00:38:54.084
All right, here we go, come on
Faith,


603
00:38:54.086 --> 00:38:55.185
come on Faith.

604
00:38:55.187 --> 00:38:56.290
Let's go.

605
00:38:58.257 --> 00:38:59.258
Come on.

606
00:39:03.363 --> 00:39:04.895
- I'm doing it.
- Look at you!


607
00:39:04.897 --> 00:39:07.097
You're a natural born cowgirl.

608
00:39:07.099 --> 00:39:08.000
Yeah, okay.

609
00:39:18.512 --> 00:39:21.346
I'm worried about you.

610
00:39:21.348 --> 00:39:22.382
Did you ask for help?

611
00:39:24.484 --> 00:39:26.553
You know, for guidance?

612
00:39:31.325 --> 00:39:33.292
Pastor Williams asked me about
you.


613
00:39:37.397 --> 00:39:39.466
He actually came by here the
other day.


614
00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:42.402
Did you talk to him?

615
00:39:44.270 --> 00:39:45.938
No, I didn't wanna see him.

616
00:39:47.239 --> 00:39:48.240
Why not?

617
00:39:50.410 --> 00:39:53.043
Because the last time I saw
him


618
00:39:53.045 --> 00:39:54.381
he was burying my father.

619
00:39:57.283 --> 00:39:59.885
He's worried about you
and your mom, you know.


620
00:40:05.525 --> 00:40:07.993
Do you wanna come to
church with me on Sunday?


621
00:40:10.162 --> 00:40:11.163
Not really.

622
00:40:12.098 --> 00:40:14.033
Even if I want you to?

623
00:40:15.968 --> 00:40:17.903
I know you do, but why?

624
00:40:21.974 --> 00:40:24.274
Because I like spending
time with you there.


625
00:40:24.276 --> 00:40:26.546
With everything going on
in your life right now,


626
00:40:28.247 --> 00:40:31.716
I think it could be really good
for you.


627
00:40:47.634 --> 00:40:49.001
Here you go.

628
00:40:50.970 --> 00:40:51.971
Thank you.

629
00:40:54.541 --> 00:40:55.542
Hungry?

630
00:40:58.578 --> 00:40:59.579
Wait.

631
00:41:01.648 --> 00:41:02.647
What?

632
00:41:02.649 --> 00:41:04.451
Why don't we give thanks.

633
00:41:06.018 --> 00:41:07.452
Really?

634
00:41:07.454 --> 00:41:09.153
Sure.

635
00:41:09.155 --> 00:41:11.589
I mean, we used to do it all the
time.


636
00:41:11.591 --> 00:41:14.360
But we haven't since Dad
passed.


637
00:41:16.128 --> 00:41:18.061
I know, but I think

638
00:41:18.063 --> 00:41:21.167
that we should start
again, especially now.


639
00:41:22.301 --> 00:41:24.334
I really don't feel like it.

640
00:41:24.336 --> 00:41:26.036
Come on, Grace.

641
00:41:26.038 --> 00:41:28.305
I'm sorry Mom, but no.

642
00:41:28.307 --> 00:41:31.676
You know that your dad
named your horse Faith


643
00:41:31.678 --> 00:41:32.679
for a reason?

644
00:41:35.482 --> 00:41:37.950
It's because he always
wanted you to have it.


645
00:41:40.219 --> 00:41:44.524
He never wanted you to quit
believing in him or in God.


646
00:42:19.358 --> 00:42:21.358
Oh, look at you.

647
00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:22.226
- Hi!
- How you doing?


648
00:42:22.228 --> 00:42:23.360
Let me help you with that.

649
00:42:23.362 --> 00:42:24.294
Oh, it's all right.

650
00:42:24.296 --> 00:42:26.330
No, it's not all right, let me
help you.


651
00:42:26.332 --> 00:42:28.733
Helping people is kind
of what I do, right?


652
00:42:28.735 --> 00:42:31.268
I didn't realize how heavy it
was.


653
00:42:31.270 --> 00:42:33.605
You gonna topple over here by
yourself,


654
00:42:33.607 --> 00:42:34.608
the wind's blowing.

655
00:42:38.612 --> 00:42:41.211
Yeah, it's kind of my job
to help people, Rebecca.


656
00:42:41.213 --> 00:42:43.113
Well, I don't think
carrying heavy furniture


657
00:42:43.115 --> 00:42:44.516
was on your resume to be a
pastor.


658
00:42:44.518 --> 00:42:47.384
Well, I don't think you
remember who I work for.


659
00:42:47.386 --> 00:42:50.256
I mean, God's my boss,
he's watching me 24/7.


660
00:43:06.272 --> 00:43:09.306
Did I ever tell you why I became
a pastor?


661
00:43:09.308 --> 00:43:12.111
No, no, you actually never
did.


662
00:43:13.547 --> 00:43:15.147
I don't talk about it much.

663
00:43:17.349 --> 00:43:18.616
In fact, I've never even told
Mike


664
00:43:18.618 --> 00:43:20.185
what I'm about to tell you.

665
00:43:25.825 --> 00:43:29.261
Growing up, my childhood was
rough.


666
00:43:30.462 --> 00:43:33.165
I got into a lot of trouble.

667
00:43:36.335 --> 00:43:38.672
I can't tell you how many times
I got kicked out of school.


668
00:43:41.407 --> 00:43:43.342
But eventually I turned my life
around.


669
00:43:44.310 --> 00:43:48.145
You know, I found Christ and
one thing just led to another,


670
00:43:48.147 --> 00:43:49.515
I found my self in church more.

671
00:43:50.516 --> 00:43:52.416
And I don't even think
that was a mere accident


672
00:43:52.418 --> 00:43:55.319
because that's where I
meet Sandra, my wife,


673
00:43:55.321 --> 00:43:58.123
and here I am.

674
00:43:59.693 --> 00:44:03.797
And that's what I wanna
do with my life now.


675
00:44:05.331 --> 00:44:08.465
I wanna help other people
turn their lives around.


676
00:44:08.467 --> 00:44:11.368
A widowed mom whose house
is about to be foreclosed,


677
00:44:11.370 --> 00:44:13.138
you sure know how to pick them.

678
00:44:14.406 --> 00:44:15.875
God knows how to pick them.

679
00:44:20.212 --> 00:44:21.213
And he picked me.

680
00:44:25.484 --> 00:44:26.485
He picked me.

681
00:44:29.321 --> 00:44:31.390
God saved me.

682
00:44:35.361 --> 00:44:36.295
And that's what I believe.

683
00:44:39.498 --> 00:44:41.400
I believe he wants me
to save other people.


684
00:44:44.236 --> 00:44:47.337
And that's what I wanna spend
the rest of my life doing.


685
00:44:47.339 --> 00:44:50.542
So I'm telling you, not
just as your pastor,


686
00:44:51.745 --> 00:44:56.750
but as your friend, let me help
you.


687
00:44:59.451 --> 00:45:00.852
You don't owe me anything.

688
00:45:00.854 --> 00:45:02.354
Yes, I do.

689
00:45:03.622 --> 00:45:06.660
Rebecca listen, we don't have
a church without you and Mike.


690
00:45:08.227 --> 00:45:10.429
Mike helped me build God a home.

691
00:45:14.266 --> 00:45:17.503
At least let me help
you try and save yours.


692
00:45:18.905 --> 00:45:21.473
Well good morning everybody,
thanks for coming!


693
00:45:23.409 --> 00:45:25.910
All right, beautiful day, I'm
excited and I hope that you,


694
00:45:25.912 --> 00:45:29.246
well you know what, I know,
I know you all are excited


695
00:45:29.248 --> 00:45:31.448
just as much as I am for the
grand opening


696
00:45:31.450 --> 00:45:32.616
of our new church.

697
00:45:35.354 --> 00:45:36.355
Yeah.

698
00:45:37.489 --> 00:45:40.524
Now, while I've always believed
that God has been here,


699
00:45:40.526 --> 00:45:43.293
always been here, let's
just say that he's got


700
00:45:43.295 --> 00:45:46.900
another place, another home
to call his own, right?


701
00:45:50.536 --> 00:45:52.404
Before I do the ceremonial
ribbon cut,


702
00:45:53.472 --> 00:45:56.473
there is just one person
we all have to thank.


703
00:45:56.475 --> 00:45:59.411
Besides the Lord, of course,
don't wanna forget him.


704
00:46:00.947 --> 00:46:04.450
But this someone, he
made this all possible


705
00:46:05.417 --> 00:46:06.618
and made my dream a reality.

706
00:46:08.487 --> 00:46:11.290
Big Mike, come on up.

707
00:46:15.327 --> 00:46:18.863
Now, he doesn't know
this, but he's the one


708
00:46:18.865 --> 00:46:20.564
that's gonna make this
ceremonial ribbon cut.


709
00:46:20.566 --> 00:46:23.500
Mike, you're gonna do it, come
on man.


710
00:46:23.502 --> 00:46:24.503
Yeah.

711
00:46:25.671 --> 00:46:27.772
Hey, thank you, thank you,
I appreciate the applause,


712
00:46:27.774 --> 00:46:32.944
but really truly, you should
be applauding yourself


713
00:46:32.946 --> 00:46:36.646
because while it's true
I did help convince


714
00:46:36.648 --> 00:46:39.316
Pastor Williams to come
here in the first place,


715
00:46:39.318 --> 00:46:41.819
I really wasn't sure
whether or not this town


716
00:46:41.821 --> 00:46:43.322
even wanted a church.

717
00:46:43.990 --> 00:46:46.523
But we restored this beautiful
building,


718
00:46:46.525 --> 00:46:50.560
it is a picturesque
little church, beautiful.


719
00:46:50.562 --> 00:46:54.533
And guess what, we have you,
you are here, yes, yeah.


720
00:46:59.338 --> 00:47:02.039
Now, it's true, this building,
it's a great building.


721
00:47:02.041 --> 00:47:06.710
But without you, it would just
be a great empty building.


722
00:47:06.712 --> 00:47:09.646
So truly I mean it, from the
bottom of my heart, thank you.


723
00:47:09.648 --> 00:47:11.481
Thank you for being here,
and thank you of course,


724
00:47:11.483 --> 00:47:13.550
to Pastor for being here.

725
00:47:13.552 --> 00:47:18.722
He's become a wonderful,
integral part of our family


726
00:47:18.724 --> 00:47:20.524
and I know that he's going
to become a wonderful,


727
00:47:20.526 --> 00:47:23.693
integral part of your families
as well.


728
00:47:23.695 --> 00:47:26.496
So without further ado, shall
we?


729
00:47:52.826 --> 00:47:54.025
This is beautiful.

730
00:47:54.027 --> 00:47:54.859
How much for that?

731
00:47:54.861 --> 00:47:56.593
Uh, 20 bucks, yeah.

732
00:47:56.595 --> 00:47:58.029
I think somebody might
be coming back for it,


733
00:47:58.031 --> 00:47:59.696
but there's records in here too.

734
00:47:59.698 --> 00:48:01.034
Dollar a record, so yeah.

735
00:48:02.534 --> 00:48:03.600
Do you wanna buy this one?

736
00:48:03.602 --> 00:48:06.137
All right, I guess I
can take off another 600,


737
00:48:06.139 --> 00:48:07.905
but that's as low as I can go.

738
00:48:07.907 --> 00:48:08.805
I'll take it.

739
00:48:08.807 --> 00:48:11.608
All right, I'll go get the
paperwork.


740
00:48:11.610 --> 00:48:12.611
Great, thanks.

741
00:48:17.951 --> 00:48:19.816
Hey, what's up, what's wrong?

742
00:48:19.818 --> 00:48:21.953
I don't think we're making
enough.


743
00:48:21.955 --> 00:48:25.124
It's still early, you
just have to have some hope.


744
00:48:28.427 --> 00:48:30.962
I'm just saying you can't
do it alone, you know.


745
00:48:30.964 --> 00:48:32.596
So what, you want me to go to
church


746
00:48:32.598 --> 00:48:34.698
and ask God for help, no.

747
00:50:21.907 --> 00:50:22.941
So how'd we do?

748
00:50:29.082 --> 00:50:32.684
I know it looks bad,
but look, don't give up.


749
00:50:41.927 --> 00:50:43.094
Hey.

750
00:50:43.096 --> 00:50:44.295
Hey.

751
00:50:44.297 --> 00:50:45.497
How you doing?

752
00:50:46.765 --> 00:50:47.766
Fine.

753
00:50:49.668 --> 00:50:51.037
Today was a disaster.

754
00:50:53.772 --> 00:50:56.808
The worst part is my mom's
gonna wanna sell Faith next.


755
00:50:59.278 --> 00:51:01.578
Seems like your mom's gonna
wanna sell everything she can


756
00:51:01.580 --> 00:51:02.748
before losing Faith.

757
00:51:03.682 --> 00:51:04.716
I'm not gonna let her.

758
00:51:06.285 --> 00:51:08.653
I lost my dad, I can't lose her
too.


759
00:51:10.689 --> 00:51:11.823
So what are you gonna do?

760
00:51:14.926 --> 00:51:15.727
I don't know.

761
00:51:17.863 --> 00:51:19.931
But if I lose her I'll have
nothing left.


762
00:51:20.966 --> 00:51:22.734
Yeah, but I mean, what's
worse,


763
00:51:24.170 --> 00:51:26.105
losing your horse or losing your
home?


764
00:51:27.005 --> 00:51:29.106
She's not just any horse.

765
00:51:29.108 --> 00:51:30.174
No, I know that, but...

766
00:51:30.176 --> 00:51:33.879
Faith is everything to
me, she's my best friend.


767
00:51:34.713 --> 00:51:36.282
Where are you gonna go, Grace?

768
00:51:37.183 --> 00:51:39.083
Where are you gonna live?

769
00:51:39.085 --> 00:51:40.817
I can't believe you're saying
this.


770
00:51:40.819 --> 00:51:43.354
So what, you just think
I should get rid of her?


771
00:51:43.356 --> 00:51:44.554
No, that's not what I'm
saying.


772
00:51:44.556 --> 00:51:47.824
Look, this isn't Faith's
fault that things got this bad,


773
00:51:47.826 --> 00:51:49.360
why should she be punished?

774
00:51:49.362 --> 00:51:50.562
She shouldn't.

775
00:51:53.999 --> 00:51:56.633
But if she's the only chance
that the ranch has left


776
00:51:56.635 --> 00:51:57.803
than maybe your mom's right.

777
00:51:59.205 --> 00:52:01.573
Maybe you don't have a
choice but to sell her.


778
00:52:03.742 --> 00:52:04.976
Just go home, Chris.

779
00:52:07.979 --> 00:52:09.045
What?

780
00:52:09.047 --> 00:52:10.782
Go home.

781
00:52:12.951 --> 00:52:14.653
I'm just trying to help.

782
00:52:16.888 --> 00:52:18.389
Grace, please.

783
00:52:18.391 --> 00:52:20.124
Did you hear me?

784
00:52:20.126 --> 00:52:21.726
I said I want you to leave!

785
00:52:42.781 --> 00:52:45.882
I'm not gonna let them take you
from me.


786
00:52:45.884 --> 00:52:48.787
If I lose the ranch then fine,
but I'm not gonna lose you.


787
00:52:53.024 --> 00:52:55.091
I'm really very
proud of you, you know that?


788
00:52:55.093 --> 00:52:56.860
Why?

789
00:52:56.862 --> 00:52:58.395
You've been feeding her,
exercising her,


790
00:52:58.397 --> 00:53:01.064
grooming her, taking great care
of her.


791
00:53:01.066 --> 00:53:02.966
Well, I enjoy it.

792
00:53:02.968 --> 00:53:04.069
Makes her so happy.

793
00:53:07.273 --> 00:53:08.940
Listen sweetheart, when I'm
gone,


794
00:53:10.976 --> 00:53:13.044
I want you to know I'm
counting on you, okay?


795
00:53:15.448 --> 00:53:18.848
Keep taking care of her, protect
her,


796
00:53:18.850 --> 00:53:20.417
make sure she's safe.

797
00:53:20.419 --> 00:53:23.119
Keep her groomed, keep her fed,
exercised.


798
00:53:23.121 --> 00:53:26.089
Whoa, hey hey hey, it's okay,

799
00:53:26.091 --> 00:53:27.125
it's all right, it's all right.

800
00:53:27.926 --> 00:53:30.059
Come on Faith, down, there you
go.


801
00:53:30.061 --> 00:53:30.894
Got her?

802
00:53:30.896 --> 00:53:31.961
Yeah, I got her.

803
00:53:31.963 --> 00:53:32.931
Thanks, Dad.

804
00:53:36.101 --> 00:53:37.102
Stay.

805
00:53:38.036 --> 00:53:39.372
Okay, good girl.

806
00:54:39.064 --> 00:54:40.297
Hello?

807
00:54:40.299 --> 00:54:42.499
I've been trying to
reach you urgently, Mrs. Evans.


808
00:54:42.501 --> 00:54:45.201
Please, I need more time.

809
00:54:45.203 --> 00:54:47.070
We keep giving you more
time,


810
00:54:47.072 --> 00:54:50.374
we filed extension after
extension after you missed


811
00:54:50.376 --> 00:54:53.042
one mortgage payment after
another.


812
00:54:53.044 --> 00:54:54.043
I realize that, but...

813
00:54:54.045 --> 00:54:57.080
And I am sorry,
Mrs. Evans, I really am,


814
00:54:57.082 --> 00:55:00.083
but as you are aware,
your ranch is scheduled


815
00:55:00.085 --> 00:55:02.353
for foreclosure on Monday.

816
00:55:02.355 --> 00:55:04.222
There's nothing more that we can
do.


817
00:55:08.827 --> 00:55:11.194
What time do I have until
exactly?


818
00:55:11.196 --> 00:55:13.064
Monday morning, nine
a.m.


819
00:55:14.899 --> 00:55:18.003
I suggest you remove all your
personal belongings by then


820
00:55:19.237 --> 00:55:22.375
when the ranch will officially
become the bank's property.


821
00:55:29.247 --> 00:55:32.215
What about me, what about my
daughter?


822
00:55:32.217 --> 00:55:36.085
Anyone found on sight
will be forcefully removed


823
00:55:36.087 --> 00:55:38.555
by the sheriff, but I trust
it won't come to that.


824
00:55:52.605 --> 00:55:56.072
Hi.

825
00:55:56.074 --> 00:55:59.310
Sorry, didn't mean to startle
you.


826
00:55:59.312 --> 00:56:02.111
My name is Luke Stark.

827
00:56:02.113 --> 00:56:04.417
I own a cattle ranch just
across the state line.


828
00:56:06.485 --> 00:56:08.985
Nice to meet you, how can I
help you?


829
00:56:08.987 --> 00:56:10.153
Well, I was driving through
town


830
00:56:10.155 --> 00:56:13.056
and I saw your sign for an
estate sale.


831
00:56:13.058 --> 00:56:14.591
Although, from the looks of it,
it seems


832
00:56:14.593 --> 00:56:17.093
that I got here a little too
late.


833
00:56:17.095 --> 00:56:20.296
I was checking out some of
your ranching equipment.


834
00:56:20.298 --> 00:56:22.999
But, unfortunately,
you don't have anything


835
00:56:23.001 --> 00:56:24.135
I don't already have.

836
00:56:26.004 --> 00:56:29.442
I did notice, though, that white
horse.


837
00:56:32.411 --> 00:56:33.412
Is she for sale?

838
00:56:57.436 --> 00:56:59.438
Yeah, well my daughters.

839
00:57:04.275 --> 00:57:07.143
Oh yeah, that's a good girl,
there you go.


840
00:57:07.145 --> 00:57:10.012
No, wait, what are you doing!

841
00:57:10.014 --> 00:57:11.147
No, get off of me!

842
00:57:11.149 --> 00:57:13.249
You can't take my horse!

843
00:57:13.251 --> 00:57:14.618
I'm afraid I already bought
her.


844
00:57:14.620 --> 00:57:18.154
No sir, please, you can't
take her away from me!


845
00:57:18.156 --> 00:57:21.292
I'm sorry, I really am,
but I already bought her.


846
00:57:23.396 --> 00:57:24.994
Mom, Mom, you can't do this!

847
00:57:24.996 --> 00:57:27.564
It's the last thing I want to
do, but...


848
00:57:27.566 --> 00:57:30.333
Is that even enough
money to pay off the bank?


849
00:57:30.335 --> 00:57:33.236
No, it's not, but this
with the other money


850
00:57:33.238 --> 00:57:35.204
it can pay back some of it and
maybe


851
00:57:35.206 --> 00:57:37.173
I can call the bank and
negotiate.


852
00:57:37.175 --> 00:57:38.477
Maybe, maybe!

853
00:57:40.278 --> 00:57:42.513
Listen, your horse will be in
good hands


854
00:57:42.515 --> 00:57:44.080
with me and my daughter.

855
00:57:44.082 --> 00:57:46.417
I promise you, we'll
take great care of her,


856
00:57:46.419 --> 00:57:48.284
we'll treat her like family.

857
00:57:48.286 --> 00:57:50.656
She already has a family!

858
00:57:53.291 --> 00:57:54.725
No.

859
00:57:54.727 --> 00:57:55.927
Good luck.

860
00:57:57.395 --> 00:57:59.262
No, no Mom, it's not too late,

861
00:57:59.264 --> 00:58:00.396
you don't have to do this.

862
00:58:00.398 --> 00:58:01.565
You can give him the money back.

863
00:58:01.567 --> 00:58:06.369
No I can't, I have no choice.

864
00:58:06.371 --> 00:58:07.606
Faith, Faith!

865
00:58:13.077 --> 00:58:14.145
Faith, Faith!

866
00:58:16.047 --> 00:58:17.048
No!

867
00:59:07.131 --> 00:59:09.200
I feel like I just ripped her
heart out.


868
00:59:18.844 --> 00:59:21.045
Shes' been through so much
and...


869
00:59:27.786 --> 00:59:31.322
Instead of making it easier on
her,


870
00:59:34.192 --> 00:59:35.761
I just made it a whole lot
worse.


871
00:59:45.203 --> 00:59:47.438
It's better that we lose our
home?


872
00:59:54.880 --> 00:59:56.682
I'm doing my best here.

873
00:59:58.249 --> 00:59:59.417
Without my husband.

874
01:00:04.389 --> 01:00:06.491
You know how hard this has been
on me.


875
01:00:10.495 --> 01:00:14.432
And now we sold everything that
we own,


876
01:00:16.167 --> 01:00:17.302
if you can hear me

877
01:00:20.538 --> 01:00:22.575
I need you now more than ever.

878
01:00:28.814 --> 01:00:30.315
I could use some miracle.

879
01:00:37.288 --> 01:00:42.193
God, I know that it's been a
while.


880
01:00:47.198 --> 01:00:49.534
It's just hard for me after my
dad passed.


881
01:00:54.439 --> 01:00:56.541
When you first took my dad from
me.


882
01:01:00.445 --> 01:01:01.446
And then Faith.

883
01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:09.786
And it looks like you're
going to take my home


884
01:01:09.788 --> 01:01:10.789
from me now too.

885
01:01:14.425 --> 01:01:16.527
What did I do to deserve this?

886
01:01:18.496 --> 01:01:20.633
I'm sorry that sometimes I lost
hope


887
01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:23.501
and even my faith.

888
01:01:26.905 --> 01:01:31.376
I'm not as strong as I
wanna be, as I should be.


889
01:01:35.446 --> 01:01:38.182
I'm asking that you bless
us and watch over us.


890
01:01:44.990 --> 01:01:46.357
I trust you.

891
01:01:49.928 --> 01:01:52.261
And I believe that you have a
plan


892
01:01:52.263 --> 01:01:53.899
and that you know what's best.

893
01:01:57.803 --> 01:02:00.471
I know that you're protecting me

894
01:02:01.940 --> 01:02:03.541
and watching over me.

895
01:02:07.278 --> 01:02:09.612
And I know that my dad is too.

896
01:02:23.829 --> 01:02:24.830
Can I come in?

897
01:02:25.663 --> 01:02:26.664
Sure.

898
01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:29.300
Are we homeless yet, Mom?

899
01:02:32.370 --> 01:02:33.371
That's not funny.

900
01:02:38.643 --> 01:02:39.575
I just wanted to let you know

901
01:02:39.577 --> 01:02:40.846
that I'm going out to church.

902
01:02:42.580 --> 01:02:45.550
Can you wait a few
minutes before you go?


903
01:02:49.687 --> 01:02:50.688
Yeah.

904
01:02:58.596 --> 01:03:01.697
I'm really glad you decided
to come with me today.


905
01:03:01.699 --> 01:03:02.500
Me too.

906
01:03:06.905 --> 01:03:11.440
Hey Mom, I'm really sorry
for the way I acted.


907
01:03:11.442 --> 01:03:14.880
I, I was scared.

908
01:03:20.085 --> 01:03:21.086
I know, sweetie.

909
01:03:23.889 --> 01:03:28.493
I realize now that
everything's gonna work out.


910
01:03:31.629 --> 01:03:32.597
How do you know that?

911
01:03:35.500 --> 01:03:37.568
Hope and faith, remember?

912
01:03:42.908 --> 01:03:44.575
I'll be right back.

913
01:03:59.423 --> 01:04:00.424
Hey, Chris.

914
01:04:01.126 --> 01:04:01.992
Hey.

915
01:04:01.994 --> 01:04:03.894
Can I talk to you for
a sec?


916
01:04:03.896 --> 01:04:04.695
Yeah.

917
01:04:08.633 --> 01:04:10.499
I'm surprised you came to church
today.


918
01:04:10.501 --> 01:04:14.104
I know, I know, but I needed
to tell you


919
01:04:14.106 --> 01:04:16.707
that I'm sorry.

920
01:04:19.443 --> 01:04:22.848
You were just trying to help
me and I pushed you away.


921
01:04:29.154 --> 01:04:30.688
Can you forgive me?

922
01:04:37.762 --> 01:04:38.563
Of course.

923
01:04:41.166 --> 01:04:42.665
Although, I don't think I have a
choice


924
01:04:42.667 --> 01:04:43.969
given that we're at church.

925
01:04:48.006 --> 01:04:51.642
Maybe we can talk some
more after the service?


926
01:04:52.878 --> 01:04:54.978
Yeah, I'd like that.

927
01:04:54.980 --> 01:04:55.981
Okay.

928
01:04:57.481 --> 01:04:58.581
Should we head in?

929
01:04:58.583 --> 01:04:59.584
Yeah.

930
01:05:02.687 --> 01:05:06.992
You know I've been talking
a lot about hope and faith.


931
01:05:07.893 --> 01:05:10.863
But today I wanna add a
third virtue to the list.


932
01:05:13.866 --> 01:05:17.499
And that's the virtue of
charity.


933
01:05:17.501 --> 01:05:21.139
First Corinthians chapter

934
01:05:22.107 --> 01:05:23.841
faith, and charity.

935
01:05:27.645 --> 01:05:29.948
And then Paul goes on to say
that,


936
01:05:30.848 --> 01:05:35.853
of these three, charity is the
greatest.


937
01:05:37.788 --> 01:05:38.891
And it got me to thinking,

938
01:05:41.759 --> 01:05:42.791
raise your hand if you've ever

939
01:05:42.793 --> 01:05:45.161
given somebody something before.

940
01:05:45.163 --> 01:05:47.529
Now, we all give.

941
01:05:47.531 --> 01:05:52.436
Money, clothing, any kind of
aid.


942
01:05:53.105 --> 01:05:56.474
And this should be the
way we all aspire to live.


943
01:05:57.142 --> 01:06:00.444
Each and every one of
you sitting here today,


944
01:06:01.879 --> 01:06:05.549
you should feel a
obligation to give charity.


945
01:06:06.851 --> 01:06:07.852
And you know why?

946
01:06:09.654 --> 01:06:14.659
Because giving charity
is also giving love.


947
01:06:19.630 --> 01:06:24.635
Love, when we love, that same
love increases hope and faith


948
01:06:27.772 --> 01:06:29.207
in those that receive it.

949
01:06:30.574 --> 01:06:34.277
There's a personal reason
why I chose to add charity


950
01:06:34.279 --> 01:06:35.479
to my sermon today.

951
01:06:41.886 --> 01:06:46.691
Inspiration, and not just from
God,


952
01:06:48.826 --> 01:06:52.797
but also from each and
every one of you here today.


953
01:06:55.666 --> 01:06:57.970
The proud members of this
community


954
01:07:00.604 --> 01:07:04.508
and members of this church,
that I love so much.


955
01:07:08.813 --> 01:07:12.516
You guys inspire me.

956
01:07:13.684 --> 01:07:18.689
You saw a need from a
family and you came together


957
01:07:19.857 --> 01:07:23.561
and you unified and you met that
need.


958
01:07:28.200 --> 01:07:31.101
But this just wasn't any old
family


959
01:07:31.103 --> 01:07:32.204
that you took care of.

960
01:07:34.972 --> 01:07:39.277
See, without this family,
we wouldn't have a church.


961
01:07:41.146 --> 01:07:43.679
Without this family we
would not be sitting


962
01:07:43.681 --> 01:07:45.649
where we are right now.

963
01:07:46.951 --> 01:07:47.952
Here's a family.

964
01:08:02.967 --> 01:08:04.769
You prayed for a miracle.

965
01:08:10.342 --> 01:08:11.776
Go on, open it.

966
01:08:19.784 --> 01:08:22.087
That's from everybody here.

967
01:08:40.905 --> 01:08:41.937
How did you?

968
01:08:41.939 --> 01:08:44.039
I opened up a charity.

969
01:08:44.041 --> 01:08:47.079
I wanted to see you save
your home, we all did.


970
01:08:49.046 --> 01:08:49.847
Thank you.

971
01:08:50.748 --> 01:08:53.851
Thank you, thank all of you,
thank you.


972
01:08:56.787 --> 01:08:58.654
I never asked for any charity.

973
01:08:58.656 --> 01:08:59.456
We know.

974
01:08:59.458 --> 01:09:00.956
And I didn't want any
handouts.


975
01:09:00.958 --> 01:09:02.194
We know that too, Rebecca.

976
01:09:03.928 --> 01:09:06.662
How could I take this, it's
too much.


977
01:09:06.664 --> 01:09:08.833
Rebecca, listen, everybody
here,


978
01:09:10.067 --> 01:09:11.733
they all know what you and your
family


979
01:09:11.735 --> 01:09:15.138
has done for both the
church and the country


980
01:09:15.140 --> 01:09:16.108
that they love so much.

981
01:09:17.942 --> 01:09:20.210
They were pleased, pleased
to open their hearts


982
01:09:20.212 --> 01:09:23.614
and their wallets to you and
Grace.


983
01:09:25.317 --> 01:09:27.017
They love you, we all do.

984
01:09:37.962 --> 01:09:39.928
I'm glad I was able
to reach you, Mr. Clark.


985
01:09:39.930 --> 01:09:41.964
Of course, I realize
your deadline


986
01:09:41.966 --> 01:09:43.031
is tomorrow morning.

987
01:09:43.033 --> 01:09:45.067
I know, that's why I called.

988
01:09:45.069 --> 01:09:48.138
I wanna let you know that
I have everything I need


989
01:09:48.140 --> 01:09:49.938
to pay what I owe.

990
01:09:49.940 --> 01:09:51.274
You have it all, really?

991
01:09:51.276 --> 01:09:52.509
I sure do.

992
01:09:52.511 --> 01:09:56.179
Well, you certainly
left it right down to the wire.


993
01:09:56.181 --> 01:10:00.983
I did, but what's important
is that I have it now.


994
01:10:00.985 --> 01:10:04.019
This ranch is gonna stay
ours, not the bank's.


995
01:10:04.021 --> 01:10:06.023
My daughter and I aren't going
anywhere.


996
01:10:11.829 --> 01:10:13.864
I think we're really gonna
like it here.


997
01:10:16.168 --> 01:10:16.967
I think so too.

998
01:10:18.470 --> 01:10:20.704
Perfect spot for us to plant
our roots.


999
01:10:27.179 --> 01:10:32.184
I want this to be our
home, and Grace's, forever.


1000
01:10:36.321 --> 01:10:37.389
It will be.

1001
01:10:55.039 --> 01:10:56.838
I can't believe what
everyone at the church


1002
01:10:56.840 --> 01:10:57.540
did for us.

1003
01:10:57.542 --> 01:11:00.343
I know, me neither.

1004
01:11:00.345 --> 01:11:02.512
And you're sure it's enough?

1005
01:11:02.514 --> 01:11:06.848
With this and the rest
of the money, it is.


1006
01:11:06.850 --> 01:11:08.085
I already talked to the bank.

1007
01:11:12.490 --> 01:11:13.491
You okay?

1008
01:11:15.527 --> 01:11:18.996
I'm so happy that we didn't
lose the house, it's just...


1009
01:11:26.203 --> 01:11:28.138
What's he doing here?

1010
01:11:40.518 --> 01:11:43.787
Afternoon, Mrs. Evans, and
Grace.


1011
01:11:44.456 --> 01:11:45.889
How's Faith doing?

1012
01:11:47.259 --> 01:11:48.959
Not so great, actually.

1013
01:11:50.160 --> 01:11:52.262
What do you mean, what
happened?


1014
01:11:52.264 --> 01:11:54.464
Well, to tell you the truth,

1015
01:11:54.466 --> 01:11:55.966
seems like she's homesick.

1016
01:11:56.934 --> 01:11:57.935
What?

1017
01:11:58.570 --> 01:12:00.104
I think she missed you a lot.

1018
01:12:01.273 --> 01:12:04.509
But you know what, I think
you should ask her yourself.


1019
01:12:06.143 --> 01:12:07.144
Faith.

1020
01:12:12.983 --> 01:12:14.484
Thank you again, so much.

1021
01:12:14.486 --> 01:12:15.487
My pleasure.

1022
01:12:17.121 --> 01:12:19.424
I don't understand, is she
ours again?


1023
01:12:21.125 --> 01:12:23.293
I called Mr. Stark from
church.


1024
01:12:23.295 --> 01:12:25.295
But before she could even say
anything


1025
01:12:25.297 --> 01:12:28.631
I already told her I wanted
you to have your horse back.


1026
01:12:28.633 --> 01:12:30.032
I couldn't sleep at all knowing

1027
01:12:30.034 --> 01:12:31.168
I'd torn her away from you.

1028
01:12:32.570 --> 01:12:34.136
Broke my heart.

1029
01:12:34.138 --> 01:12:35.305
I offered to buy her back,

1030
01:12:35.307 --> 01:12:38.208
but he told me just to go
ahead and tear up the check.


1031
01:12:39.209 --> 01:12:40.378
That she'd be yours again.

1032
01:12:43.213 --> 01:12:45.115
Hey Faith, hey Faith.

1033
01:13:05.069 --> 01:13:06.538
Glad you got to keep the
ranch.


1034
01:13:08.172 --> 01:13:11.139
Would have been a travesty
to lose this place.


1035
01:13:11.141 --> 01:13:13.177
We have enough money
to repay the bank now.


1036
01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:18.215
Have you thought about
what you're gonna do next?


1037
01:13:19.216 --> 01:13:22.052
We haven't had time to
come up with a game plan yet,


1038
01:13:23.053 --> 01:13:27.523
but the ranch isn't generating
any revenue for us anymore.


1039
01:13:27.525 --> 01:13:29.394
Well, you should change that.

1040
01:13:36.568 --> 01:13:38.470
Why'd you want Faith to begin
with?


1041
01:13:39.537 --> 01:13:42.405
Well, I have a little girl and
I thought


1042
01:13:42.407 --> 01:13:44.272
she'd love your horse.

1043
01:13:44.274 --> 01:13:46.511
But don't worry, lots of
other horses out there.


1044
01:13:48.011 --> 01:13:49.313
You know how kids love horses.

1045
01:13:53.217 --> 01:13:55.350
Mom, mom, that's it!

1046
01:13:55.352 --> 01:13:57.720
That's how we can get the
ranch making money again.


1047
01:13:57.722 --> 01:13:58.353
What do you mean?

1048
01:13:58.355 --> 01:13:59.221
We can start a business.

1049
01:13:59.223 --> 01:14:01.990
Horse trail rides, horse riding
lessons.


1050
01:14:01.992 --> 01:14:05.062
We have so many acres on our
property that we can use.


1051
01:14:06.330 --> 01:14:07.532
I don't know.

1052
01:14:08.633 --> 01:14:10.700
Mom, we have to give
ourselves a fighting chance


1053
01:14:10.702 --> 01:14:12.470
to hold on to this place
forever.


1054
01:14:14.572 --> 01:14:18.608
Well, it's a good idea,
but where are we gonna


1055
01:14:18.610 --> 01:14:21.209
come up with the money to buy
more horses?


1056
01:14:21.211 --> 01:14:23.213
You could always bring on a
partner.


1057
01:14:26.418 --> 01:14:27.217
Really?

1058
01:14:28.218 --> 01:14:30.387
Well, I'd least give
it some serious thought.


1059
01:14:31.689 --> 01:14:33.456
My daughter is much younger than
you


1060
01:14:33.458 --> 01:14:37.027
but she absolutely adores
horses, as do I.


1061
01:14:38.996 --> 01:14:42.032
And there aren't any other
businesses in the area like it.


1062
01:14:44.636 --> 01:14:46.571
Think you can come up with a
good name?


1063
01:14:50.340 --> 01:14:53.141
Hope Ranch has
now become a reality.


1064
01:14:53.143 --> 01:14:54.444
With Luke's help we went out

1065
01:14:54.446 --> 01:14:56.113
and bought some beautiful
horses.


1066
01:14:58.450 --> 01:15:01.183
But while all of our new
horses are beautiful,


1067
01:15:01.185 --> 01:15:04.487
Faith is, of course, still my
favorite.


1068
01:15:04.489 --> 01:15:06.421
I watched your game yesterday.

1069
01:15:06.423 --> 01:15:07.289
Really?

1070
01:15:07.291 --> 01:15:09.324
Why didn't you tell me?

1071
01:15:09.326 --> 01:15:11.259
I thought if you knew I was
watching you


1072
01:15:11.261 --> 01:15:12.762
it would throw you off.

1073
01:15:12.764 --> 01:15:14.466
It probably would have, yeah.

1074
01:15:16.133 --> 01:15:19.167
But, that catch you made
was pretty incredible.


1075
01:15:19.169 --> 01:15:20.370
I was so proud of you.

1076
01:15:22.674 --> 01:15:25.040
I'm really proud of you too,
you know?


1077
01:15:25.042 --> 01:15:26.476
For what?

1078
01:15:26.478 --> 01:15:28.145
For everything you've done
here.


1079
01:15:29.146 --> 01:15:30.214
And for not giving up.

1080
01:15:31.248 --> 01:15:32.249
Thank you.

1081
01:16:03.447 --> 01:16:04.448
Whoa.

1082
01:16:05.382 --> 01:16:06.450
- Ready?
- Yeah.


1083
01:16:16.426 --> 01:16:18.861
Mom and I have already signed
up all the local schools


1084
01:16:18.863 --> 01:16:21.564
for class field trips
and adults of all ages


1085
01:16:21.566 --> 01:16:24.268
are coming too for
horseback riding lessons.


1086
01:16:25.402 --> 01:16:27.870
It's going to take a lot of hard
work


1087
01:16:27.872 --> 01:16:30.540
but we're excited and we all
know


1088
01:16:30.542 --> 01:16:32.307
that Hope Ranch will be a
success.
