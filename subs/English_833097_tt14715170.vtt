25
00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.750
So, just say no.

26
00:02:22.833 --> 00:02:25.166
Tell your father you don't want the job.

27
00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.375
He flew me all the way up here
in his private jet for Christmas.


28
00:02:28.458 --> 00:02:30.583
I don't want to hurt his feelings.

29
00:02:31.166 --> 00:02:33.416
Wow. Good morning, Miss Belmont.

30
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.166
I'm Terry Carver from Guest Services.
Your father has asked me


31
00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.330
to work as your personal assistant
while you're here.


32
00:02:38.375 --> 00:02:39.916
And this is your Glam Squad.

33
00:02:40.416 --> 00:02:41.416
Fine.

34
00:02:41.458 --> 00:02:44.000
It's just that I don't want to be
in the hotel business.


35
00:02:44.083 --> 00:02:46.000
Have you tried telling him that?

36
00:02:48.791 --> 00:02:50.333
Mm. Daddy wouldn't understand.

37
00:02:50.416 --> 00:02:53.125
As far as he's concerned,
this is the perfect career for me.


38
00:02:53.208 --> 00:02:56.250
<i>I'm just trying to imagine
what you'd have to wear.</i>


39
00:02:56.333 --> 00:02:58.333
<i>Not a name tag, I hope.</i>

40
00:03:02.083 --> 00:03:05.416
- What exactly is the position?
- Vice President of Atmosphere.


41
00:03:05.916 --> 00:03:09.416
It's not even a real job. I think he just
made it up to give me something to do.


42
00:03:10.708 --> 00:03:13.083
And, you know,
it's hard enough for me as it is.


43
00:03:13.166 --> 00:03:15.875
When people look at me,
all they see is the spoiled daughter


44
00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:19.083
of Beauregard Belmont, the hotel magnate.
And I'm not spoiled!


45
00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.541
Dress or slacks?

46
00:03:21.625 --> 00:03:23.666
I don't know. Is that pleather?

47
00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:24.750
Vegan leather.

48
00:03:25.291 --> 00:03:28.583
Oh, Tad, help me!
I need to make my own mark in the world.


49
00:03:28.666 --> 00:03:29.875
<i>Okay, okay.</i>

50
00:03:30.458 --> 00:03:31.875
How are your socials doing?

51
00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:35.416
Not good. I told you my accounts
were hacked by that girl, remember?


52
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.916
Ugh! Right. Lucky you're dating
one of <i>Hype Magazine's</i>


53
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.750
<i>top social influencers then.</i>

54
00:03:39.833 --> 00:03:41.708
So you remind me every day.

55
00:03:42.375 --> 00:03:44.458
<i>After lunch with your father,</i>

56
00:03:44.541 --> 00:03:47.708
why don't we hit the slopes
and snap a few ussies? Hmm?


57
00:03:47.791 --> 00:03:49.208
Post them on Instagram.

58
00:03:49.291 --> 00:03:51.500
I thought you wanted to keep
our relationship private.


59
00:03:51.583 --> 00:03:53.833
<i>Well, maybe it's time
we let the world in on it.</i>


60
00:03:53.916 --> 00:03:56.291
Talk about boosting your numbers.

61
00:03:56.375 --> 00:04:00.500
And it will prove to your father you could
have a career as an influencer too.


62
00:04:00.583 --> 00:04:03.791
Yeah, I just want people to remember me
for more than my last name.


63
00:04:03.875 --> 00:04:05.958
You leave it to your Tad.

64
00:04:06.041 --> 00:04:07.208
Oh, trending down.

65
00:04:07.291 --> 00:04:09.583
Time for a selfie in
a limo. See you soon.

66
00:04:09.666 --> 00:04:11.875
Okay, I love... Hello?

67
00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:13.208
Bad connection?

68
00:04:14.583 --> 00:04:17.416
Something like that.
Let's go with the Valenyagi.


69
00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.458
- Good choice.
- And a fabulous hat.


70
00:04:30.916 --> 00:04:31.916
Mr. Belmont!

71
00:04:32.833 --> 00:04:34.666
Hey! Glad I caught you.

72
00:04:36.583 --> 00:04:38.875
Hi. Hey. Uh, I'm
Jake Russell. I own the...

73
00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.875
- The North Star Lodge.
- Yeah.


74
00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:43.208
Yeah, my secretary mentioned you called.

75
00:04:44.041 --> 00:04:46.333
- Fifteen times.
- Was it that many?


76
00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:48.375
So, what's the urgency?

77
00:04:48.458 --> 00:04:50.458
I just wanted
a minute of your time if I could.


78
00:04:50.541 --> 00:04:51.541
Sure.

79
00:04:53.166 --> 00:04:55.500
But you're gonna have to beat me
to the bottom of the run.


80
00:04:55.583 --> 00:04:57.750
- Seriously?
- Well, what do you think?


81
00:05:05.708 --> 00:05:07.625
Falling behind, boy!

82
00:05:13.041 --> 00:05:14.125
Better get moving!

83
00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:32.791
Good run.

84
00:05:32.875 --> 00:05:36.125
Yeah, I thought I had you there
for a minute, but you got me in the end.


85
00:05:36.208 --> 00:05:38.916
Let's go. You can talk while we walk.

86
00:05:43.125 --> 00:05:44.333
Thanks, Skyler.

87
00:05:44.416 --> 00:05:47.166
Wow, this place looks like
something out of SpaceX.


88
00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:49.250
Well, we try to
stay ahead of the curve.

89
00:05:49.333 --> 00:05:51.000
In here.

90
00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.750
Wow. Well, you have
an incredible place here, sir.


91
00:05:53.833 --> 00:05:56.291
It's, uh, truly a world-class
skiing destination.


92
00:05:57.291 --> 00:06:00.041
But, you know, not everybody
can afford world-class.


93
00:06:00.125 --> 00:06:03.708
Studies show that 70% of beginners
learn to ski at these smaller resorts.


94
00:06:03.791 --> 00:06:04.708
Like yours.

95
00:06:04.791 --> 00:06:07.708
Exactly. And then as they become
more accomplished and better skiers,


96
00:06:07.791 --> 00:06:10.166
then they move up
to the mega-resorts, like this one.


97
00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:12.130
And you think
that I should invest in your lodge


98
00:06:12.166 --> 00:06:14.541
in order to make sure
that this keeps happening, correct?


99
00:06:14.625 --> 00:06:15.791
Uh, more or less, yeah.

100
00:06:15.875 --> 00:06:17.583
Oh, Skyler. Cocoa?

101
00:06:18.625 --> 00:06:20.416
- Um, sure.
- Two please.


102
00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:21.625
Of course, Mr. Belmont.

103
00:06:21.708 --> 00:06:24.083
But I have the numbers here
for a cost-effective upgrade,


104
00:06:24.166 --> 00:06:27.750
a high-speed lift, you know,
building on a spa with a hot tub, sauna...


105
00:06:27.833 --> 00:06:31.625
Mr. Russell, I wish I could help you,
but I have my own investors to answer to.


106
00:06:31.708 --> 00:06:34.000
- I'm sure you understand. Thank you, dear.
- Well...


107
00:06:34.833 --> 00:06:36.041
Here you go. On the house.

108
00:06:36.125 --> 00:06:38.333
- And anything else he may need today.
- Of course.


109
00:06:38.416 --> 00:06:40.541
If you'll excuse me, I gotta run.

110
00:06:40.625 --> 00:06:44.708
Oh, and, uh, pretty classy out there
letting me win.


111
00:06:45.666 --> 00:06:46.666
Well done.

- It was an accident!


140
00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:58.541
You know, I came around the corner,
she was coming around,


141
00:07:58.625 --> 00:08:01.375
- and we just, wham, a chocolate thing.
- Is everything all right?


142
00:08:01.458 --> 00:08:03.500

- Tad!

and ruined her haute couture onesie.

145
00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:13.625
- Again, I'm so sorry. It was an accident.
- Look, mate. Just go, all right? Just go.


146
00:08:14.208 --> 00:08:15.208
That way.

147
00:08:15.791 --> 00:08:17.458
Yeah. Yeah. Easy with the finger.

148
00:08:21.833 --> 00:08:25.500
Would mademoiselle care for the artisanal,
house-smoked bacon on her wedge salad?

No, thank you. 
I don't do bacon.

Very well.

00:08:33.666 --> 00:08:37.875
So, Ted, how is this online
internet business thing of yours going?


152
00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:41.416
It's Tad, Daddy.
And it's not a business thing.


153
00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:44.291
Tad's an influencer.
Millions of people follow him.


154
00:08:44.375 --> 00:08:45.750
Basically, you're a salesman.

155
00:08:47.041 --> 00:08:49.208
So how long have you two
been seeing each other now?


156
00:08:49.291 --> 00:08:50.916
Almost a year, Mr. Belmont.

157
00:08:51.666 --> 00:08:53.583
I think it's time you call him Beauregard.

158
00:08:54.166 --> 00:08:55.000
Right, Daddy?

159
00:08:55.083 --> 00:08:57.583
Oh! Okay.

160
00:08:57.666 --> 00:08:59.416
Anyway, Beau.

161
00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:01.500
You know how it is. One day...

162
00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.000
there she is.

163
00:09:06.083 --> 00:09:07.458
In the coffee shop of life.

164
00:09:08.791 --> 00:09:10.583
Sierra is a venti.

165
00:09:18.208 --> 00:09:19.708
Trending!

166
00:09:20.416 --> 00:09:21.416
Oh!

167
00:09:52.291 --> 00:09:53.291
Hi.

168
00:09:55.416 --> 00:09:58.000
- Hi, Jake.
- Hi, how's it going? Hey, buddy.


169
00:10:01.916 --> 00:10:03.000
Oh, come on.

170
00:10:03.583 --> 00:10:05.263
- Everything all right?
- Hey, Jake.


171
00:10:05.666 --> 00:10:07.726
Trying to get this one going,
but it's not happening.


172
00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:10.267
Okay. Yeah, just leave it
in the shed, and I'll get to it later.


173
00:10:10.291 --> 00:10:11.291
You got it.

174
00:10:14.166 --> 00:10:16.416
Hey! Where you guys going?

175
00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:20.125
Dad! The Christmas Wish Tree, remember?
Mom took us every year.


176
00:10:20.208 --> 00:10:22.333
- That's right.
- And now it's Grandma's job.


177
00:10:23.291 --> 00:10:25.875
Jake! Why don't you come with us?

178
00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.458
Well, as fun as that sounds,

179
00:10:27.541 --> 00:10:30.501
I have guests that want a sleigh ride,
so I'll take a snow check this time.


180
00:10:30.583 --> 00:10:34.000
But would you do me a favor? Would you
put in a good word with Santa for me?


181
00:10:34.083 --> 00:10:35.458
I need all the help I can get.

182
00:10:35.541 --> 00:10:37.833
I take it things didn't go well?

183
00:10:37.916 --> 00:10:39.436
Belmont was literally the last resort.

184
00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:41.559
If the rest of the season's this way,
I don't think...


185
00:10:41.583 --> 00:10:43.208
We just need a little patience.

186
00:10:43.291 --> 00:10:44.833
What we need is a miracle.

187
00:10:45.416 --> 00:10:48.708
Haven't you heard, Dad?
Christmas is a time for miracles.


188
00:10:48.791 --> 00:10:50.166
- Right, Grandma?
- That's right.


189
00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:51.625
Well, I love your optimism.

190
00:10:53.041 --> 00:10:55.000
All right. Yeah.
Bring me back something good.


191
00:11:52.333 --> 00:11:55.708
Yeah. I'm ready to leave for the airport.
Could you have my car brought around?


192
00:11:55.791 --> 00:11:58.059
<i>- Yes, Mr. Belmont.</i>
- Oh, good. You're still here.


193
00:11:58.083 --> 00:12:00.666
- Oh, hi!
- I didn't wanna miss you before you left.


194
00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:02.250
Well, I'll be back by the weekend.

195
00:12:02.333 --> 00:12:04.500
We will get you set
up in your new office.

196
00:12:04.583 --> 00:12:06.583
I was thinking the one next to mine
if that's okay?


197
00:12:06.666 --> 00:12:09.375
Oh, Daddy. About the job...

198
00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.166
Yeah?

199
00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:12.583
Well, it's just that...

200
00:12:14.583 --> 00:12:16.166
I just don't wanna disappoint you.

201
00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:19.208
I don't think
you could do that, honey.


202
00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:22.583
Oh, I haven't seen this in a while.

203
00:12:25.083 --> 00:12:26.875
Your mother gave me that in Gstaad.

204
00:12:30.041 --> 00:12:32.521
She said
that the little girl reminded her of you.


205
00:12:33.833 --> 00:12:35.458
I'm surprised you remember.

206
00:12:36.583 --> 00:12:38.250
You were only five when she...

207
00:12:38.333 --> 00:12:40.708
I remember her perfume and her laugh.

208
00:12:41.791 --> 00:12:43.583
How she used to brush my hair.

209
00:12:45.333 --> 00:12:47.666
This hotel reminds me
so much of her.


210
00:12:48.875 --> 00:12:49.875
I still miss her.

211
00:12:52.666 --> 00:12:53.666
Me too.

212
00:12:58.833 --> 00:13:00.517
I promised your mother
I'd take care of you.


213
00:13:00.541 --> 00:13:01.541
You have.

214
00:13:01.916 --> 00:13:04.291
I mean, you've given me
everything I've ever wanted.


215
00:13:04.875 --> 00:13:05.875
Okay.

216
00:13:07.291 --> 00:13:09.708
Well, honey, I'll be back
by Christmas Eve.


217
00:13:09.791 --> 00:13:10.791
Okay.

218
00:13:11.291 --> 00:13:12.500
Have a safe flight.

219
00:13:12.583 --> 00:13:13.875
And don't worry about me.

220
00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:15.625
I'll be in very good hands.

221
00:13:15.708 --> 00:13:16.958
I'll be with Tad.

222
00:13:19.083 --> 00:13:20.563
Yes, sir!

223
00:13:21.375 --> 00:13:23.208
Look out! Coming through!

224
00:13:23.291 --> 00:13:25.708
- Hello, move! Move!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!


225
00:13:28.375 --> 00:13:30.750
Now, I don't want to be disturbed
when I'm with Tad.


226
00:13:30.833 --> 00:13:32.458
If I need anything, 
I'll text you.

227
00:13:32.541 --> 00:13:35.125
Of course. When would you like
dinner sent up to your suite?


228
00:13:35.208 --> 00:13:37.583
Terry, I said, "Do not disturb."

229
00:13:38.791 --> 00:13:40.833
M'lady, your chariot awaits.

230
00:13:40.916 --> 00:13:42.916
I thought we were doing
the photo shoot here.


231
00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.958
Yeah, I've reserved a private gondola.

232
00:13:45.041 --> 00:13:48.291
Gondolas are for losers. Hop in.

233
00:13:52.125 --> 00:13:53.208
He's colorful.

234
00:13:57.958 --> 00:14:00.625
You know, Daddy would have loved
if we did the shoot here.


235
00:14:00.708 --> 00:14:02.541
Just you wait, angel cakes.

236
00:14:02.625 --> 00:14:03.916
Just you wait.

237
00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.125
Ow!

238
00:14:06.333 --> 00:14:11.166
<i>♪ And a partridge

239
00:14:13.083 --> 00:14:14.000

258

All right, lovebirds. I got hot cocoa
and fresh gingerbread cookies.


259
00:15:03.916 --> 00:15:05.541
- Are you two ready?
- Yeah, let's go!


260
00:15:05.625 --> 00:15:07.250
Is this thing safe?

261
00:15:07.333 --> 00:15:10.083
My friend,
this fine piece of craftsmanship


262
00:15:10.166 --> 00:15:12.083
has served the North Star for generations.

263
00:15:12.166 --> 00:15:13.750
Where's your sense of adventure?

264
00:15:14.791 --> 00:15:15.916
Couldn't be safer.

265
00:15:16.916 --> 00:15:18.500
Yo, something just fell off!

266
00:15:19.083 --> 00:15:20.833
- Cookie?
- Thank you.


267
00:15:20.916 --> 00:15:22.416
- It'll be fine.
- Have a good ride.


268
00:15:22.916 --> 00:15:23.916
Hiya!

269
00:15:37.291 --> 00:15:39.208
Where exactly are we going?

270
00:15:39.291 --> 00:15:41.750
I follow one of the top off-trail skiers
in the country,


271
00:15:41.833 --> 00:15:44.375
and he geotagged this secluded spot.

272
00:15:45.833 --> 00:15:47.083
It looks amazing.

273
00:15:48.125 --> 00:15:49.708
Heavy.

274
00:15:49.791 --> 00:15:50.791
Oh!

275
00:15:51.416 --> 00:15:53.708
You do know
I don't actually ski, don't you?


276
00:15:53.791 --> 00:15:55.458
No one needs to know that!

277
00:15:55.541 --> 00:15:58.208
It's all smoke and mirrors, baby.

278
00:15:59.583 --> 00:16:01.783
Do you know how to unhook the snowmobile,
by any chance?


279
00:16:01.833 --> 00:16:04.041
Do I look like
I know how to unhook a snowmobile?


280
00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:06.000
I'll figure it out.

281
00:16:08.875 --> 00:16:10.916
Okay, snowmobile, unhook.

282
00:16:11.541 --> 00:16:13.250
- What are you doing?
- Wait!


283
00:16:13.333 --> 00:16:16.041
Tad, it's not voice-activated,
for God's sake!


284
00:16:17.833 --> 00:16:18.833
Oh!

285
00:16:19.833 --> 00:16:21.125
- Oh!
- Tad!


286
00:16:22.125 --> 00:16:23.416
Tad!

287
00:16:24.375 --> 00:16:25.458
Ooh!

288
00:16:25.541 --> 00:16:27.375
Tad! I'm getting beaten back here!

289
00:16:27.458 --> 00:16:28.458
Ooh!

290
00:16:29.208 --> 00:16:30.875
Having fun?

291
00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:31.958
So much fun.

292
00:16:34.375 --> 00:16:37.875
No signal, okay.
Guess we just have to wing it.


293
00:16:37.958 --> 00:16:39.291
I think it's...

294
00:16:39.875 --> 00:16:40.875
this way.

295
00:16:41.208 --> 00:16:43.168
You don't know how to get back
to the car, do you?


296
00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:44.625
Yes, I do.

297
00:16:45.208 --> 00:16:46.875
Hang on.

298
00:16:48.875 --> 00:16:50.208
- Tad!
- Oh!


299
00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:54.458
Look, it's the Wishing Tree!

300
00:16:58.125 --> 00:17:01.541
Hot roasted chestnuts, folks,
right here. Okay.


301
00:17:03.083 --> 00:17:04.541
We're next.

302
00:17:05.250 --> 00:17:08.916
And remember, you only get one wish,
so make it count.


303
00:17:14.875 --> 00:17:19.083
That's good, but could you try
to look a little more athletic?


304
00:17:19.166 --> 00:17:22.046
But, Tad, I wanna look... I wanna
look sporty, but not like I'm sweating.


305
00:17:24.083 --> 00:17:26.958
- There's just one thing missing.
- What?


306
00:17:27.041 --> 00:17:30.416
Well, I can't quite
put my finger on it,

307
00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:32.416
but maybe you can?

308
00:17:37.041 --> 00:17:41.541
Sierra Belmont,
the last almost-a-year with you


309
00:17:41.625 --> 00:17:43.250
has been truly magical.

310
00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:46.958
And I want you to know that
whatever the future brings,


311
00:17:48.291 --> 00:17:49.666
I want it to bring us together.

312
00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:51.875
- Oh!
- Sierra Belmont...


313
00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:55.666
...will you marry me?

314
00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:56.750
Oh, Tad!

315
00:17:58.375 --> 00:18:00.833
Tad, it's too big, sweetie.

316
00:18:01.458 --> 00:18:02.625
We could have it resized.

317
00:18:02.708 --> 00:18:03.541
Oh.

318
00:18:03.625 --> 00:18:05.458
Let's make it official, shall we?

319
00:18:06.833 --> 00:18:11.583
Our first social media post
as an engaged couple!


320
00:18:18.333 --> 00:18:19.208
There.

321
00:18:19.291 --> 00:18:21.333
- I wish...
- Don't... Don't tell me.


322
00:18:21.416 --> 00:18:24.583
You have to keep it a secret,
or it won't come true.


323
00:18:25.083 --> 00:18:27.184
- You guys have a Merry Christmas.
- Thank you.


324
00:18:27.208 --> 00:18:28.833
Okay.

325
00:18:30.458 --> 00:18:31.458
What was your wish?

326
00:18:31.958 --> 00:18:34.458
Um... Uh... I got my wish.

327
00:18:35.625 --> 00:18:37.541
When your mommy and daddy had you.

328
00:18:37.625 --> 00:18:40.000
Ah! I love you, Grandma.

329
00:18:40.083 --> 00:18:41.083
Mm.

330
00:18:41.875 --> 00:18:44.041
Okay. Let's put it up in that branch.

331
00:18:44.125 --> 00:18:45.375
- Ready?
- Yes.


332
00:18:47.916 --> 00:18:50.166
- There.
- Oh. Very good.


333
00:19:15.541 --> 00:19:17.208
- Hm? Oh.
- Oh!


334
00:19:18.958 --> 00:19:20.833
- Tad?
- Looks like the weather's changing.


335
00:19:20.916 --> 00:19:22.250
Take me back to the hotel.

336
00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.666
- Okay. Okay.
- Tad.


337
00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:26.250
Tad!

338
00:19:26.333 --> 00:19:27.583
Whoa! Oh!

339
00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:30.416
Hold on, Sierra!

340
00:19:31.166 --> 00:19:32.916
I've got you!

341
00:19:33.625 --> 00:19:35.541
- I'm slipping!
- Hold on!


342
00:19:40.916 --> 00:19:41.916
Sierra!

343
00:19:43.541 --> 00:19:45.125
No!

344
00:19:45.208 --> 00:19:46.208
Oh my...

345
00:19:48.791 --> 00:19:49.833
Oh!

346
00:20:17.166 --> 00:20:19.625
<i>♪ Jingle bells, jingle bells ♪</i>

347
00:20:19.708 --> 00:20:21.958
<i>♪ Jingle all the way ♪</i>

348
00:20:22.041 --> 00:20:24.208
<i>♪ Oh, what fun
it is to ride ♪</i>

349
00:20:24.291 --> 00:20:25.625
<i>♪ In a one-horse open... ♪</i>

350
00:20:25.708 --> 00:20:26.708
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

351
00:20:27.166 --> 00:20:28.375
Hey, hang tight, guys.

352
00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:34.500
What is it?

353
00:20:35.375 --> 00:20:38.750
- Oh, it better not be a dead body.
- Stop it. You're freaking me out.


354
00:20:39.833 --> 00:20:41.000
Oh my God.

355
00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:42.500
Is it a dead body?

356
00:20:46.125 --> 00:20:47.666
Hey, miss, can you hear me?

357
00:20:52.041 --> 00:20:54.434
Hey, base camp, this is Jake.
I'm on the far side of Hoosier.


358
00:20:54.458 --> 00:20:57.916
We have a Code 3. Repeat, Code 3.
I need Ski Patrol immediately.


359
00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.640
<i>You got it, Jake.</i>

360
00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:09.750
Oh! Uh... How is she?

361
00:21:09.833 --> 00:21:12.250
Physically, she's all right.
Minor concussion.


362
00:21:12.333 --> 00:21:14.333
But that's not the real problem.

363
00:21:14.416 --> 00:21:16.875
She says she doesn't remember anything
prior to the accident.


364
00:21:16.958 --> 00:21:17.875
Amnesia?

365
00:21:17.958 --> 00:21:19.416
Or something like it.

366
00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:21.750
Well, at least she's awake.
That's a good thing, right?


367
00:21:21.833 --> 00:21:23.958
Well, that depends
upon your point of view.


368
00:21:24.041 --> 00:21:25.726
- Ma'am, hold still.
- Stop!


369
00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:28.333
No, don't touch me!
Would you get your hands off of me?


370
00:21:28.416 --> 00:21:31.166
Look, I told you I'm perfectly fine, okay?

371
00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:32.750
Okay, all right.

372
00:21:32.791 --> 00:21:34.751
It's okay. We'll try later.

373
00:21:34.833 --> 00:21:37.114
Thank you, Gene. 
We'll take it from here.

374
00:21:37.583 --> 00:21:40.208
Finally, at last, someone with authority.

375
00:21:40.291 --> 00:21:43.000
Sheriff, could you please tell her
to let me out of here?


376
00:21:43.083 --> 00:21:45.083
Well, miss,
we'd love to be able to do that,


377
00:21:45.166 --> 00:21:47.458
but first we need to figure out
who you are.


378
00:21:47.541 --> 00:21:48.833
What do you mean who I am?

379
00:21:48.916 --> 00:21:50.333
I know who I am.

380
00:21:51.208 --> 00:21:52.208
My name is...

381
00:21:53.083 --> 00:21:54.250
My name is...

382
00:21:55.958 --> 00:21:57.125
My name is...

383
00:21:57.708 --> 00:22:00.083
Well, we checked your clothing
for any identification,


384
00:22:00.166 --> 00:22:01.250
but there was nothing.

385
00:22:01.333 --> 00:22:03.500
Oh! I mean, I did find this.

386
00:22:03.583 --> 00:22:04.750
Makeup.

387
00:22:05.583 --> 00:22:06.833
Where are my clothes?

388
00:22:06.916 --> 00:22:09.583
I'm afraid the ER team
had to cut you out of those.


389
00:22:09.666 --> 00:22:11.916
Hey, uh, what about fingerprints?

390
00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.500
We took those when we brought her in.

391
00:22:13.583 --> 00:22:17.166
They're not registered in our database,
which means she's never been arrested


392
00:22:17.250 --> 00:22:19.000
or possibly never even employed.

393
00:22:19.083 --> 00:22:21.291
So what are we
supposed to do with her?

394
00:22:21.375 --> 00:22:24.541
Well, I could put her picture up
on our missing person website.


395
00:22:24.625 --> 00:22:26.291
But it is the holidays, you know.

396
00:22:26.375 --> 00:22:29.458
Until someone comes looking for her
or until she remembers something,


397
00:22:29.541 --> 00:22:30.958
there's not much I can do.

398
00:22:31.041 --> 00:22:33.541
Excuse me, <i>she</i>is right here in the room,

399
00:22:33.625 --> 00:22:35.791
and she is tired
of being treated like a prisoner


400
00:22:35.875 --> 00:22:37.916
just because
you all can't do your job, so...


401
00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:39.583
- Ow!
- Oh!


402
00:22:39.666 --> 00:22:41.166
- Oh, my head.
- Okay.


403
00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:42.083
Ow!

404
00:22:42.166 --> 00:22:43.291
Take it easy. Take it easy.

405
00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.583
Look, miss.

406
00:22:47.666 --> 00:22:49.625
I wish there was
more that I could do,

407
00:22:49.708 --> 00:22:53.000
but we have procedures to follow
when we're dealing with a Jane Doe.


408
00:22:53.583 --> 00:22:54.583
A Jane Doe?

409
00:22:55.041 --> 00:22:56.250
I am not a Jane Doe!

410
00:22:56.333 --> 00:22:58.250
Well, I don't know
what else to call you.

411
00:22:58.333 --> 00:23:01.541
You've got no identity, no money,
and no place to go.


412
00:23:03.416 --> 00:23:05.000
I have a place. 
I mean, the lodge.

413
00:23:05.083 --> 00:23:08.416
I mean, we have some cancellations.
She could stay with us.


414
00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.333
And you are?

415
00:23:10.416 --> 00:23:12.791
This is Jake Russell.
He's the one who found you.


416
00:23:13.916 --> 00:23:15.750
Does he look familiar to you at all?

417
00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:21.208
No, he is definitely a stranger.

418
00:23:21.708 --> 00:23:24.958
And I'm not about to follow him
to some murder cabin in the woods.


419
00:23:25.041 --> 00:23:27.708
Jake owns the North Star Lodge.

420
00:23:27.791 --> 00:23:29.750
Oh, the North Star Lodge?

421
00:23:31.208 --> 00:23:33.875
Okay. Does it have room service?

422
00:23:33.958 --> 00:23:37.500
You know, it's actually more of, like,
a bed-and-breakfast type place.


423
00:23:37.583 --> 00:23:39.250
What kind of breakfast?

424
00:23:39.333 --> 00:23:42.458
On second thought,
I think she's probably better off here.


425
00:23:42.541 --> 00:23:43.541
No.

426
00:23:44.208 --> 00:23:45.208
Well...

427
00:23:45.541 --> 00:23:48.458
Actually, you know, reestablishing
a normal routine of activities


428
00:23:48.541 --> 00:23:49.791
might help jog your memory.

429
00:23:50.375 --> 00:23:52.708
It's up to you. 
Now, you can stay here,

430
00:23:52.791 --> 00:23:55.375
or you can take old
Jake up on his offer.

431
00:24:03.916 --> 00:24:04.916
Brilliant!

432
00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.875
Just absolutely bloody brilliant!

433
00:24:08.458 --> 00:24:13.291
What kind of crap forest
doesn't have a cell tower?


434
00:24:21.708 --> 00:24:23.875
Hello, this is Tad Fairchild.

435
00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:28.333
I've just survived a death-defying fall,

436
00:24:28.833 --> 00:24:31.750
and I'm currently stranded
in a remote glacial forest.


437
00:24:32.333 --> 00:24:34.041
This recording will be a testament

438
00:24:34.125 --> 00:24:37.250
to my brave fight for life
against all odds.


439
00:24:40.083 --> 00:24:41.125
Hm.

440
00:24:41.208 --> 00:24:42.791
But should anyone find my body...

441
00:24:43.958 --> 00:24:46.041
...please upload this vid...

442
00:24:59.958 --> 00:25:01.333
Where am I?

443
00:25:14.833 --> 00:25:17.000
All righty. Went through
the lost and found.


444
00:25:17.083 --> 00:25:19.708
Not sure if these will fit,
but they're better than scrubs.


445
00:25:19.791 --> 00:25:21.250
Guess they'll have to do for now.

446
00:25:21.958 --> 00:25:24.458
Ew. Are these used?

447
00:25:24.541 --> 00:25:26.000
Uh... Probably.

448
00:25:26.083 --> 00:25:29.416
But, you know, sometimes guests
leave things here by accident, so...


449
00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:31.500
Not sure this was left here by accident.

450
00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.250
Okey-dokey, your room is ready.

451
00:25:34.333 --> 00:25:37.083
Here are some fresh towels,
and there are clean sheets on the bed.


452
00:25:37.166 --> 00:25:39.291
Look, I appreciate everything
you guys are doing,


453
00:25:39.375 --> 00:25:42.458
but I'm not gonna be here for that long.
This is just temporary.


454
00:25:42.541 --> 00:25:44.583
Well, until then, you're stuck with us.

455
00:25:46.083 --> 00:25:47.541
- I'll show you the way.
- Okay.


456
00:25:48.041 --> 00:25:48.958
Oh.

457
00:26:09.083 --> 00:26:10.958
Ooh!

458
00:26:16.458 --> 00:26:17.625
What happened?

459
00:26:17.708 --> 00:26:20.500
Hi. Uh... There was
a wild, hairy beast out there!


460
00:26:20.583 --> 00:26:21.958
Okay, I'll check it out.

461
00:26:25.166 --> 00:26:27.166
I think you're okay. They're gone.

462
00:26:28.416 --> 00:26:29.976
You know, we are out in the wilderness,

463
00:26:30.041 --> 00:26:32.500
so you're bound to have a few visitors
from time to time.


464
00:26:32.583 --> 00:26:34.333
Right. Well, they can stay out there.

465
00:26:35.208 --> 00:26:36.500
Yeah, I'll let them know.

466
00:26:41.291 --> 00:26:43.125
- What?
- Uh, nothing.


467
00:26:43.875 --> 00:26:45.083
Nice granny gown.

468
00:26:46.791 --> 00:26:48.375
Well, if that's a compliment...

469
00:26:49.375 --> 00:26:50.375
I'll take it.

470
00:26:51.666 --> 00:26:52.833
Good night.

471
00:27:14.041 --> 00:27:16.500
<i>♪ Hanging my fishing hooks ♪</i>

472
00:27:16.583 --> 00:27:18.541
<i>♪ Hoping for a fish... ♪</i>

473
00:27:28.666 --> 00:27:30.583
Sanctuary!

474
00:27:34.250 --> 00:27:37.250
I thought I'd never see
another human being again.


475
00:27:38.833 --> 00:27:41.083
Look at you.

476
00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:46.166
You're beautiful.

477
00:27:46.250 --> 00:27:47.958
What's your name, savior?

478
00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:49.500
Ralph.

479
00:27:49.583 --> 00:27:50.583
Ralph?

480
00:27:51.250 --> 00:27:52.791
My phone battery's dead.

481
00:27:54.041 --> 00:27:56.750
I don't suppose you have a charger here
for the model 15, do you?


482
00:27:57.291 --> 00:27:59.625
Uh, no. Don't like cell phones.

483
00:27:59.708 --> 00:28:01.208
- Hm.
- Don't trust them.


484
00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:03.833
Want some coffee?

485
00:28:03.916 --> 00:28:05.666
Yes, please, Ralph. Huh!

486
00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:11.250
After my nightmarish ordeal,
that would be the nectar of the gods.


487
00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.458
Mm.

488
00:28:17.833 --> 00:28:20.250
Can I help get
that lure out your face?

489
00:28:21.666 --> 00:28:22.666
What lure?

490
00:28:24.125 --> 00:28:26.166
The one stuck in your face.

491
00:28:27.791 --> 00:28:28.791
Oh, I see it.

492
00:28:33.541 --> 00:28:35.041
Uh-huh.

493
00:28:41.583 --> 00:28:43.333
It was just a dream.

494
00:28:52.083 --> 00:28:54.208
What's wrong with this thing?

495
00:29:04.458 --> 00:29:05.291
- Hi!
- Hello!


496
00:29:05.375 --> 00:29:06.500
Good morning!

497
00:29:06.583 --> 00:29:08.041
Good morning!

498
00:29:09.833 --> 00:29:11.041
It's not a dream.

499
00:29:13.333 --> 00:29:14.333
Who are you?

500
00:29:21.208 --> 00:29:22.208
Hello.

501
00:29:23.541 --> 00:29:24.833
Your room is a mess.

502
00:29:24.916 --> 00:29:27.500
Yeah, nobody's come to clean it yet.

503
00:29:29.041 --> 00:29:30.083
I'm Avy.

504
00:29:30.166 --> 00:29:32.916
You're the lady who doesn't know
who she is, right?


505
00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:34.916
I guess that's me.

506
00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.541
My dad told me.

507
00:29:37.333 --> 00:29:39.250
Do you have anything
I could dry my hair with?


508
00:29:39.333 --> 00:29:41.083
- Of course. In my room.
- Thank you.


509
00:29:48.666 --> 00:29:51.000
So, what are we supposed to call you?

510
00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:55.041
Good question. I don't know.
Do you have any names you like?


511
00:29:55.875 --> 00:29:56.875
Well,

512
00:29:57.833 --> 00:29:59.250
You can have one of theirs.

513
00:30:00.250 --> 00:30:01.250
Oh.

514
00:30:01.333 --> 00:30:02.333
Come meet them.

515
00:30:04.291 --> 00:30:08.666
That's Frankie, that's Wallace,
that's Potter, and that's Sarah.


516
00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:09.958
Hmm.

517
00:30:10.041 --> 00:30:12.250
Sarah. I like that one.

518
00:30:12.333 --> 00:30:14.458
Okay. Sarah it is.

519
00:30:16.208 --> 00:30:17.916
Oh. Is this your mom?

520
00:30:21.958 --> 00:30:22.958
Yeah.

521
00:30:23.750 --> 00:30:25.666
She died almost two years ago.

522
00:30:26.666 --> 00:30:27.750
I'm so sorry.

523
00:30:29.625 --> 00:30:30.708
I miss her a lot.

524
00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.375
Sometimes...

525
00:30:34.208 --> 00:30:35.208
Hmm?

526
00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:39.291
Nothing. You'll think it's weird.

527
00:30:39.375 --> 00:30:43.041
Well, I don't even know who I am.
Nothing's weirder than that.


528
00:30:44.291 --> 00:30:45.291
Well...

529
00:30:46.791 --> 00:30:49.166
Sometimes I talk to her picture.

530
00:30:49.250 --> 00:30:52.750
I don't think that's weird at all.
I think that's beautiful.


531
00:30:58.750 --> 00:31:00.250
Hey, how are you feeling?

532
00:31:00.333 --> 00:31:01.666
Do you know me?

533
00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:04.458
- We met on the sleigh ride.
- You were unconscious the whole time.


534
00:31:04.541 --> 00:31:05.708
Oh.

535
00:31:05.791 --> 00:31:07.208
- Enjoy breakfast.
- Thank you.


536
00:31:07.291 --> 00:31:08.666
I was unconscious.

537
00:31:08.750 --> 00:31:10.416
Hey, everybody! 
This is Sarah!

538
00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:12.458
Oh, Sarah.

539
00:31:12.541 --> 00:31:13.958
We're trying it out.

540
00:31:14.041 --> 00:31:16.125
You've already met my dad.
This is my grandma.


541
00:31:16.208 --> 00:31:17.666
Yes. Alejandra.

542
00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:18.750
That's right.

543
00:31:19.416 --> 00:31:22.750
Well, Sarah, we just ran out
of pumpkin pancakes,


544
00:31:22.833 --> 00:31:25.500
but if you'd like,
I can make you some eggs.


545
00:31:25.583 --> 00:31:28.666
Oh, please, I'm perfectly capable
of making my own breakfast.


546
00:31:31.916 --> 00:31:33.250
It's broken.

547
00:31:33.333 --> 00:31:36.500
Yeah. No, you just gotta...
You gotta push it in and then twist it.


548
00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:38.625
Thank you.

549
00:31:40.333 --> 00:31:43.000
Oh, this comes out fast.

550
00:31:43.708 --> 00:31:44.541
Egg?

551
00:31:44.625 --> 00:31:45.666
Thank you.

552
00:31:46.375 --> 00:31:47.458
Oh!

553
00:31:48.041 --> 00:31:49.958
Well, you showed that egg who's boss.

554
00:31:50.041 --> 00:31:51.416
A little messy.

555
00:31:53.375 --> 00:31:56.041
You know what?
Um... Why don't you sit over there,


556
00:31:56.125 --> 00:31:59.125
and I will take
care of all of this.

557
00:31:59.208 --> 00:32:00.458
Okay, good idea.

558
00:32:03.583 --> 00:32:06.125
- Hm. Bacon?
- I don't do bacon.


559
00:32:07.166 --> 00:32:08.833
But bacon is delicious.

560
00:32:08.916 --> 00:32:10.208
Have you ever tried it?

561
00:32:10.708 --> 00:32:12.125
I don't remember.

562
00:32:12.625 --> 00:32:14.875
Then how do you know
you don't do it?


563
00:32:14.958 --> 00:32:15.958
Huh.

564
00:32:20.333 --> 00:32:21.333
I like bacon.

565
00:32:24.666 --> 00:32:26.666
Mm.

566
00:32:27.208 --> 00:32:28.488
What are these muffins?

567
00:32:28.541 --> 00:32:30.666
I don't think
she's from around here, dear.


568
00:32:30.750 --> 00:32:33.017
- What's your favorite one?
- Something about her...


569
00:32:33.041 --> 00:32:34.958
Mm.

570
00:32:35.041 --> 00:32:36.750
I know... I feel
like I've met her before.

571
00:32:37.416 --> 00:32:38.416
Really?

572
00:32:46.791 --> 00:32:49.958
Well, she said
she didn't want to be disturbed.


573
00:32:50.041 --> 00:32:52.250
But that was almost 24 hours ago.

574
00:32:52.333 --> 00:32:53.333
Miss Belmont?

575
00:32:53.416 --> 00:32:56.416
This is hotel security.
May I come in? Hello?


576
00:33:00.291 --> 00:33:01.416
Miss Belmont?

577
00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:02.916
It's me, Terry.

578
00:33:04.083 --> 00:33:05.958
But she didn't sleep here last night.

579
00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.875
Are you sure? Maybe she made the bed?

580
00:33:08.958 --> 00:33:12.416
Miss Belmont make the bed?
Not in this lifetime.


581
00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:20.875
"Sierra, can't wait to take you away."

582
00:33:20.958 --> 00:33:22.208
"Love, Tad."

583
00:33:22.833 --> 00:33:25.250
Sounds like they planned
to go off someplace together.


584
00:33:25.333 --> 00:33:27.208
- But where?
- Don't touch me.


585
00:33:27.291 --> 00:33:28.291
Got it.

586
00:33:38.083 --> 00:33:39.083
Where am I?

587
00:33:43.375 --> 00:33:44.375
Huh?

588
00:33:44.875 --> 00:33:45.875
Ralph?

589
00:33:52.250 --> 00:33:53.250
No way.

590
00:34:00.125 --> 00:34:01.125
Ralph!

591
00:34:11.833 --> 00:34:12.833
Ralph!

592
00:34:15.375 --> 00:34:16.458
Morning!

593
00:34:16.541 --> 00:34:18.916
Thought I'd let you sleep in.
You looked all cozy.


594
00:34:19.750 --> 00:34:22.250
Is that your truck?

595
00:34:22.958 --> 00:34:23.833
Yeah.

596
00:34:23.916 --> 00:34:25.416
What's going on with it?

597
00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:28.291
Dead as last night's roadkill.

598
00:34:28.375 --> 00:34:29.625
Horrible visual.

599
00:34:29.708 --> 00:34:31.833
We'll leave a note, head out on foot.

600
00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.708
It's just a couple days' hike
through the pass to get to the road.


601
00:34:35.791 --> 00:34:37.833
- Days?
- Depending on the weather.


602
00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:42.250
Hey, how about I whip us up
some fried fish for breakfast? Sound good?


603
00:34:42.333 --> 00:34:45.250
Oh, I don't eat fish. They are exotic pets
in my saltwater aquarium


604
00:34:45.333 --> 00:34:46.583
at my condo in Manhattan.

605
00:34:46.666 --> 00:34:48.416
Well, fine by me.

606
00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:50.500
Get your own breakfast.

607
00:34:51.625 --> 00:34:54.708
- What am I supposed to do with this?
- Hurl it at a squirrel?


608
00:34:56.291 --> 00:34:58.500
No, it's all right.

609
00:34:59.541 --> 00:35:00.541
Thank you.

610
00:35:00.875 --> 00:35:02.125
Merry Christmas.

611
00:35:02.875 --> 00:35:04.125
Another cancellation.

612
00:35:04.625 --> 00:35:07.333
- You're kidding?
- They're going to an Airbnb instead.


613
00:35:07.416 --> 00:35:10.541
- Well, how do we compete with that?
- It's all going to work out.


614
00:35:10.625 --> 00:35:13.625
Well, I don't know how. Look at this.
We can't even afford a housekeeper.


615
00:35:13.708 --> 00:35:14.788
- I know.
- Hey.


616
00:35:15.375 --> 00:35:18.541
I was just wondering,
any calls regarding me?


617
00:35:18.625 --> 00:35:19.625
Afraid not.

618
00:35:20.083 --> 00:35:21.833
I just don't understand.

619
00:35:22.333 --> 00:35:24.500
I mean, surely someone is out there
looking for me.


620
00:35:24.583 --> 00:35:26.875
You haven't been able
to remember anything?


621
00:35:26.958 --> 00:35:30.666
No, but the doctor did say
that if I did normal things,


622
00:35:30.750 --> 00:35:32.000
my memory might come back.

623
00:35:32.833 --> 00:35:35.166
But I wonder what she meant
by "normal things."


624
00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:42.791
<i>♪ We wish you the merriest ♪</i>

625
00:35:42.875 --> 00:35:43.958
Doctor's orders.

626
00:35:44.458 --> 00:35:46.875
<i>♪ The merriest, yes, the merriest ♪</i>

627
00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.000

I don't think so.

Nope. Stick with me, buddy.

658
00:37:27.666 --> 00:37:29.250
I don't think I can make it!

659
00:37:29.916 --> 00:37:32.083
Ralph!

660
00:37:35.416 --> 00:37:36.416
Just leave me here.

661
00:37:38.875 --> 00:37:40.166
Save yourself.

662
00:37:40.250 --> 00:37:41.250
Hang in there.

663
00:37:42.416 --> 00:37:43.791
I gotcha, buddy.

664
00:37:46.458 --> 00:37:47.458
- Here.
- Oh.


665
00:37:49.041 --> 00:37:50.500
- Ooh!
- All right. Here.


666
00:37:52.083 --> 00:37:53.208
You're so strong.

667
00:37:53.291 --> 00:37:54.291
This'll do ya.

668
00:37:55.583 --> 00:37:56.958
- Oh!
- There we go.


669
00:37:59.375 --> 00:38:00.375
Ready?

670
00:38:01.416 --> 00:38:02.666
But what about you?

671
00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:05.958
Hey, don't you worry about me.
I got big feet.


672
00:38:06.041 --> 00:38:07.958
Come on. Here we go.

673
00:38:12.458 --> 00:38:13.958
Ow! Ow!

674
00:38:16.125 --> 00:38:16.958
Ow!

675
00:38:17.041 --> 00:38:18.500
Hey there. Are you okay?

676
00:38:18.583 --> 00:38:19.875
- It's stuck.
- Oh.


677
00:38:21.708 --> 00:38:22.833
Let me help you.

678
00:38:23.583 --> 00:38:24.583
Thank you.

679
00:38:30.541 --> 00:38:34.416
Sometimes you can't rush things.

680
00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:36.625
You just have to take your time.

681
00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:39.375
You know, my mom always said,

682
00:38:39.458 --> 00:38:42.416
"The worst tangles
will sort themselves out..."


683
00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:44.916
...if you just give them a little help.

684
00:38:46.958 --> 00:38:48.078
There you go.

685
00:38:48.541 --> 00:38:50.083
The tangles are all gone.

686
00:39:02.083 --> 00:39:03.416
You remember your mom?

687
00:39:05.333 --> 00:39:07.458
Yeah. I think I do.

688
00:39:13.791 --> 00:39:14.791
Avy?

689
00:39:15.375 --> 00:39:16.375
Oh!

690
00:39:17.458 --> 00:39:18.875
What happened here?

691
00:39:19.458 --> 00:39:21.166
What is this?

692
00:39:21.250 --> 00:39:22.291
- Oh.
- It wasn't me, Dad.


693
00:39:22.375 --> 00:39:23.541
Look at this mess!

694
00:39:23.625 --> 00:39:24.666
I'm sorry.

695
00:39:25.750 --> 00:39:28.125
Great. This is the last thing
I need right now.


696
00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:41.500
Oh.

697
00:39:41.583 --> 00:39:42.708
Hey there.

698
00:39:44.083 --> 00:39:45.083
Balthazar.

699
00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:47.000
Nice to meet you.

700
00:39:49.083 --> 00:39:50.500
I'd introduce myself,

701
00:39:51.416 --> 00:39:52.958
but I have no idea who I am.

702
00:39:54.125 --> 00:39:56.541
I can tell you
I'm pretty much a useless human.


703
00:39:57.375 --> 00:39:58.833
I can't do anything right.

704
00:40:00.541 --> 00:40:02.958
You'd think I'd have
some sort of skill, wouldn't you?


705
00:40:07.083 --> 00:40:08.500
Thanks for your support.

706
00:40:09.833 --> 00:40:13.500
Now, let's see if I can manage
to fetch some wood.


707
00:40:15.041 --> 00:40:16.041
See you later.

708
00:40:40.375 --> 00:40:42.000
Oh.

709
00:40:46.708 --> 00:40:48.083
Whoa! Oh!

710
00:40:49.083 --> 00:40:50.250
Oh.

711
00:40:53.583 --> 00:40:55.041
Gosh. Are you hurt?

712
00:40:55.125 --> 00:40:56.125
No.

713
00:40:56.791 --> 00:40:58.291
I... I'll get it. Uh...

714
00:40:59.791 --> 00:41:00.791
You all right?

715
00:41:02.791 --> 00:41:04.000
Yeah.

716
00:41:05.541 --> 00:41:06.541
Look, I'm...

717
00:41:07.541 --> 00:41:10.041
I didn't mean what
I said earlier. It was...

718
00:41:12.916 --> 00:41:14.083
It's not just that.

719
00:41:15.125 --> 00:41:18.583
It's been almost two days,
and what? No one's found me yet?


720
00:41:19.583 --> 00:41:21.666
I'm like unclaimed luggage.

721
00:41:22.208 --> 00:41:23.750
Hey, come on. Don't say that.

722
00:41:23.833 --> 00:41:26.875
I... I bet you got family and friends
who are worried sick about you.


723
00:41:26.958 --> 00:41:30.250
I mean, they're probably out there
looking for you right now.


724
00:41:30.958 --> 00:41:31.958
You think?

725
00:41:32.041 --> 00:41:33.166
Of course.

726
00:41:33.250 --> 00:41:36.125
You know what? Why don't we go
to the Christmas Market downtown?


727
00:41:36.208 --> 00:41:38.541
Okay, it's a big street fair,
a lot of people there.


728
00:41:38.625 --> 00:41:41.541
You know, maybe somebody
will recognize you.


729
00:41:41.625 --> 00:41:43.041
I don't wanna be any more trouble.

730
00:41:43.125 --> 00:41:45.166
No, it's... it's really no trouble.

731
00:41:45.250 --> 00:41:47.500
Besides, Avy would love it.

732
00:41:47.583 --> 00:41:49.125
All right.

733
00:41:56.250 --> 00:41:58.333
Nah, that's... 
You can keep it.

734
00:41:59.958 --> 00:42:00.958
- Right.
- Yeah.


735
00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:02.000
Thanks.

736
00:42:12.916 --> 00:42:14.541
Wow, this is really pretty.

737
00:42:15.416 --> 00:42:16.666
Any of this ring a bell?

738
00:42:17.333 --> 00:42:21.000
No, nothing. I don't think
I've ever been here in my life.


739
00:42:23.375 --> 00:42:25.500
Come on! You guys are too slow!

740
00:42:27.083 --> 00:42:29.666
Avy gets pretty excited about Christmas.

741
00:42:33.208 --> 00:42:35.875
Wow, what a pretty sleigh.

742
00:42:36.750 --> 00:42:38.833
She takes after Carla.

743
00:42:38.916 --> 00:42:40.291
She was my wife.

744
00:42:40.375 --> 00:42:42.083
Yeah, Avy told me about her.

745
00:42:43.458 --> 00:42:44.541
I'm sorry.

746
00:42:44.625 --> 00:42:45.625
Thank you.

747
00:42:46.041 --> 00:42:48.291
It's been a rough couple of years.

748
00:42:48.375 --> 00:42:51.625
I mean, I didn't even think
we were gonna stay here after.


749
00:42:51.708 --> 00:42:52.875
But where would you go?

750
00:42:52.958 --> 00:42:55.208
I don't know, like,
maybe back to the city?


751
00:42:55.708 --> 00:42:57.916
I used to have
a, uh... ski travel business.

752
00:42:58.833 --> 00:43:01.875
But the North Star's been
in Carla's family for three generations.


753
00:43:01.958 --> 00:43:03.791
Her father gave it to us
as a wedding gift,


754
00:43:03.875 --> 00:43:06.750
and I kind of just...
fell in love with the place.


755
00:43:08.375 --> 00:43:10.833
- I don't want to have to sell it, but...
- But?


756
00:43:10.916 --> 00:43:12.934
You know, people,
they... they like the new resorts,


757
00:43:12.958 --> 00:43:15.291
the flashy stuff,
all the bells and whistles.


758
00:43:15.791 --> 00:43:18.875
But I still think there's something
really special about the simple things.


759
00:43:18.958 --> 00:43:22.000
You know, like home-style meals,

760
00:43:23.083 --> 00:43:25.041
hot chocolate by the fireplace,

761
00:43:25.708 --> 00:43:26.875
a home away from home.

762
00:43:29.291 --> 00:43:30.291
I don't know.

763
00:43:31.750 --> 00:43:32.750
Maybe I'm wrong.

764
00:43:36.458 --> 00:43:37.458
Dad, Sarah.

765
00:43:38.458 --> 00:43:39.458
Look at this.

766
00:43:43.250 --> 00:43:44.708
Isn't it beautiful?

767
00:43:44.791 --> 00:43:48.041
You have very good taste in sleighs,
young lady.


768
00:43:48.541 --> 00:43:51.583
This one's a beauty, all handmade.

769
00:43:51.666 --> 00:43:53.625
Rides like the wind.

770
00:43:53.708 --> 00:43:55.708
Well, that's a fantastic-looking sleigh.

771
00:43:57.750 --> 00:44:00.291
Um... But I am afraid
it is out of our league.


772
00:44:00.375 --> 00:44:04.208
Well, I'm here watching this stall
for a friend.


773
00:44:04.291 --> 00:44:08.666
So, if you see anything else
that you'd like, well... Oh!


774
00:44:14.041 --> 00:44:15.041
Look at this.

775
00:44:17.333 --> 00:44:18.875
Oh, it's beautiful.

776
00:44:27.083 --> 00:44:28.083
You okay?

777
00:44:28.791 --> 00:44:30.000
Yeah. Uh...

778
00:44:31.583 --> 00:44:32.916
You know what? 
We'll take it.

779
00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:35.208
How wonderful.

780
00:44:35.958 --> 00:44:38.000
- For you.
- No, Jake, I couldn't.


781
00:44:38.083 --> 00:44:39.958
Oh, come on. It's an early Christmas gift.

782
00:44:40.666 --> 00:44:41.708
Thank you.

783
00:44:45.083 --> 00:44:45.916
There you go.

784
00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:47.500
Merry Christmas.

785
00:44:47.583 --> 00:44:49.041
Merry Christmas.

786
00:44:49.125 --> 00:44:50.041
Thank you.

787
00:44:50.125 --> 00:44:52.000
Come on.
We don't wanna miss the tree-lighting.


788
00:44:52.083 --> 00:44:53.083
Let's go!

789
00:45:00.208 --> 00:45:02.208
Merry Christmas, everyone.

790
00:45:02.291 --> 00:45:05.583
Please welcome
the mayor of Summit Springs.


791
00:45:08.208 --> 00:45:11.875
Welcome, everyone, to our annual
Christmas tree-lighting ceremony.


792
00:45:11.958 --> 00:45:15.000
You know, this is such a special event,

793
00:45:15.083 --> 00:45:16.458
and just between you and me,

794
00:45:16.541 --> 00:45:19.208
I think it's my favorite reason
to be mayor of Summit Springs.


795
00:45:21.166 --> 00:45:23.916
Ah! But you didn't come here
to listen to me yakking, right?


796
00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:27.625
You came in to see some lights.
So, hey, without further ado...


797
00:45:27.708 --> 00:45:30.583
Why don't you come on up here, sweetie,
and help me pull this switch?


798
00:45:30.666 --> 00:45:31.500
Me?

799
00:45:34.458 --> 00:45:37.708
When we count down, I want you
to push that little candy cane, okay?


800
00:45:38.208 --> 00:45:40.875
Summit Springs, are you ready?

801
00:45:40.958 --> 00:45:42.125
Yeah!

802
00:45:42.708 --> 00:45:44.875
All right! Count with me.

803
00:45:45.500 --> 00:45:50.750
Five, four, three, two, one!

804
00:45:51.708 --> 00:45:53.833
Oh!

805
00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:00.666
<i>♪ Joy to the world,
the Lord is come ♪</i>

806
00:46:00.750 --> 00:46:05.166
<i>♪ Let Earth receive her King ♪</i>

807
00:46:05.750 --> 00:46:07.083
Come on, I can't hear you.

808
00:46:07.166 --> 00:46:08.541
Oh, I can't sing.

809
00:46:08.625 --> 00:46:11.333
Who told you that?
Come on, it's Christmas.


810
00:46:11.416 --> 00:46:13.958
<i>♪ And Heaven and nature sing ♪</i>

811
00:46:14.041 --> 00:46:16.666
<i>♪ And Heaven and nature sing ♪</i>

812
00:46:16.750 --> 00:46:23.625
<i>♪ And Heaven, and Heaven

813
00:46:39.750 --> 00:46:41.708
All right.
Good night, jellybean.


814
00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:54.083
She is out

815
00:46:55.125 --> 00:46:56.125
like a light.

816
00:46:57.625 --> 00:47:00.291
You know, um, when you first saw
that snow globe,


817
00:47:00.375 --> 00:47:03.333
you had this look in your eyes
like you had seen it before.


818
00:47:04.666 --> 00:47:07.916
Yeah, I suddenly had this memory
of being a little girl,


819
00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:11.083
and this beautiful woman
gave me something like that.


820
00:47:11.833 --> 00:47:13.750
And I think it
might have been my mother.

821
00:47:14.250 --> 00:47:16.041
But then, it was gone.

822
00:47:16.125 --> 00:47:19.958
Well, I mean, at least you remembered
something. That's a start.


823
00:47:20.541 --> 00:47:21.541
Yeah.

824
00:47:27.125 --> 00:47:29.833
Well, it's been a long night.

825
00:47:29.916 --> 00:47:31.416
Yeah. Yeah. Uh...

826
00:47:31.500 --> 00:47:33.541
Yeah, I'm pretty beat too, so...

827
00:47:35.375 --> 00:47:36.375
Um...

828
00:47:37.541 --> 00:47:38.541
Good night.

829
00:47:39.625 --> 00:47:40.625
Good night.

830
00:47:41.666 --> 00:47:43.083
- Jake?
- Uh-huh?


831
00:47:43.583 --> 00:47:45.125
I just wanted to tell you

832
00:47:46.333 --> 00:47:48.791
I don't think I've ever met
anyone like you before


833
00:47:49.541 --> 00:47:53.083
because if I had,
I would definitely remember it.


834
00:47:59.375 --> 00:48:00.375
Good night.

835
00:48:16.125 --> 00:48:17.925
- Good morning.
- Good morning!


836
00:48:22.875 --> 00:48:24.875
It's just me, dear. 
I come to make the...

837
00:48:29.541 --> 00:48:32.250
The trick is, it's all in the wrists.

838
00:48:33.541 --> 00:48:34.666
Okay.

839
00:48:38.541 --> 00:48:41.333
Okay, that's okay. One more.
Do it again. Again.


840
00:48:41.416 --> 00:48:44.541
- Okay. You know, just use both hands.
- Okay.


841
00:48:44.625 --> 00:48:45.791
One,

842
00:48:45.875 --> 00:48:46.875
two,

843
00:48:47.541 --> 00:48:48.625
three!

844
00:48:48.708 --> 00:48:50.208
Hey!

845
00:48:50.291 --> 00:48:52.750
There you go,
hand-eye coordination. All right!


846
00:48:52.833 --> 00:48:53.833
There you go.

847
00:48:54.416 --> 00:48:56.291
- I hope you like it.
- Yum!


848
00:48:59.833 --> 00:49:02.291
Just the right amount.

849
00:49:02.791 --> 00:49:03.875
Perfect.

850
00:49:03.958 --> 00:49:05.000
Okay.

851

854
00:49:18.291 --> 00:49:21.208
You have to make sure
you use lots of icing to keep it in place.


855
00:49:21.291 --> 00:49:22.708
- Okay. That good?
- Yeah.


856
00:49:22.791 --> 00:49:24.041
- Yeah.
- Yeah.


857
00:49:25.458 --> 00:49:26.458
Oh my...

858
00:49:26.875 --> 00:49:28.250
Not cool.

859
00:49:28.333 --> 00:49:29.333
- Both of you!
- Hey!


860
00:49:29.375 --> 00:49:31.208
You're both in on this!

861
00:49:31.291 --> 00:49:34.583
All right, guys, remember,
inside edge, okay?


862
00:49:34.666 --> 00:49:36.666
Last one down buys pizza. Ready?

863
00:49:36.750 --> 00:49:37.750
Go!

864
00:49:38.166 --> 00:49:40.291
Let's go!

865
00:49:40.875 --> 00:49:44.000
- Looking great, everyone!
- Are you ready to ski?


866
00:49:44.083 --> 00:49:45.750
I don't know if I remember how.

867
00:49:45.833 --> 00:49:48.958
It's gonna be easy. Follow the kids,
take it slow, just like I said.


868
00:49:49.041 --> 00:49:51.000
- You're gonna be fine.
- Okay.


869
00:49:51.083 --> 00:49:53.250
Now, let's see what you got. Let's go!

870
00:49:54.250 --> 00:49:55.291
Whoo!

871
00:49:57.916 --> 00:49:59.250
Not bad.

872
00:49:59.333 --> 00:50:00.333
Woo-hoo!

873
00:50:01.875 --> 00:50:02.875
Oh no.

874
00:50:06.083 --> 00:50:06.916
Hang on!

875
00:50:12.916 --> 00:50:13.916
Ooh!

876
00:50:13.958 --> 00:50:14.958
I got you!

877
00:50:20.791 --> 00:50:22.333
Sorry, I didn't mean to.

878
00:50:22.416 --> 00:50:23.416
It's okay.

879
00:50:25.458 --> 00:50:27.208
Thank you for saving me.

880
00:50:27.291 --> 00:50:28.291
Any time.

881
00:50:32.250 --> 00:50:33.250
Uh...

882
00:50:33.791 --> 00:50:36.250
All right, nice.
Here you go. That's the bill.


883
00:50:36.833 --> 00:50:37.666
You all be safe.

884
00:50:37.750 --> 00:50:39.291
- Thanks again.
- Thank you.


885
00:50:41.166 --> 00:50:43.583
Thanks for staying at the North Star.
And Merry Christmas.


886
00:50:43.666 --> 00:50:45.333
- You too.
- Bye, Sarah.


887
00:50:45.416 --> 00:50:46.416
Bye.

888
00:50:57.041 --> 00:50:57.958
Alejandra?

889
00:50:58.041 --> 00:51:01.708
Oh, I'm sorry, dear.
I didn't see you there.


890
00:51:03.458 --> 00:51:04.458
Are you okay?

891
00:51:05.541 --> 00:51:08.291
I'm fine. Just a little blue, I guess.

892
00:51:09.166 --> 00:51:12.125
Probably shouldn't have started
looking through this in the first place.


893
00:51:13.208 --> 00:51:14.208
What is it?

894
00:51:14.833 --> 00:51:16.500
I call it our memory book.

895
00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:21.958
Christmas cards, wedding programs,
notes from guests.


896
00:51:23.708 --> 00:51:26.708
Oh, your daughter. 
She's really beautiful.

897
00:51:26.791 --> 00:51:28.000
Thank you.

898
00:51:30.250 --> 00:51:32.541
You are beautiful too.

899
00:51:37.125 --> 00:51:40.083
I like to remind
myself every now and then

900
00:51:40.166 --> 00:51:43.916
how our little family lodge
has touched other people's lives.


901
00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:45.333
Especially...

902
00:51:46.750 --> 00:51:49.416
...since we might
not be here much longer.


903
00:51:50.083 --> 00:51:51.708
I thought Jake didn't want to sell.

904
00:51:51.791 --> 00:51:53.541
He might not have a choice.

905
00:51:54.458 --> 00:51:55.958
The way things are going,

906
00:51:56.791 --> 00:51:59.791
this might be our last Christmas
at North Star Lodge.


907
00:52:01.375 --> 00:52:04.208
Anyway, that's nothing for you
to worry about.


908
00:52:05.458 --> 00:52:07.083
I've got to pick up, Avy.

909
00:52:07.958 --> 00:52:08.791
Ah...

910
00:52:08.875 --> 00:52:11.291
Can you put that back in Jake's desk
when you're done?


911
00:52:11.375 --> 00:52:12.750
- Sure.
- Thank you.


912
00:52:37.875 --> 00:52:40.875
- Hey, what's going on?
- Oh, hi. The drawer was stuck.


913
00:52:40.958 --> 00:52:43.000
Yeah, I've been meaning to fix that.

914
00:52:43.083 --> 00:52:44.708
This is really beautiful.

915
00:52:45.291 --> 00:52:47.625
- Why don't you put it on the tree?
- Um...


916
00:52:48.375 --> 00:52:49.375
Because it...

917
00:52:51.416 --> 00:52:52.791
I'm not ready to put it up.

918
00:52:53.708 --> 00:52:56.000
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's really none of my business.


919
00:52:56.083 --> 00:52:59.083
No, I'm... I'm sorry. I just... It's...

920
00:53:00.791 --> 00:53:05.125
We... We... Um, Carla and I
bought it together, and...


921
00:53:06.333 --> 00:53:07.541
And then she got sick.

922
00:53:08.916 --> 00:53:09.791
And...

923
00:53:11.916 --> 00:53:13.583
I don't... I don't
wanna get rid of it,

924
00:53:13.666 --> 00:53:16.541
but I can't bring myself
to put it on the tree. So, I...


925
00:53:22.708 --> 00:53:25.875
You know what? I gotta go 'cause
I'm gonna be late for the toy drive.


926
00:53:25.958 --> 00:53:26.958
Uh, toy drive?

927
00:53:27.750 --> 00:53:31.750
Yeah. You know, Summit Springs
has one every year


928
00:53:31.833 --> 00:53:34.250
for families who are having
a rough go of it, so...


929
00:53:34.875 --> 00:53:36.041
That's really sweet.

930
00:53:36.125 --> 00:53:38.833
Yeah, well, you know, every kid
deserves something for Christmas.


931
00:53:40.333 --> 00:53:41.583
Do you need any help?

932
00:53:44.333 --> 00:53:46.000
Yes, that would be nice.

- I just finished my first one.


938
00:54:07.291 --> 00:54:08.291
Wow!

939
00:54:09.250 --> 00:54:12.541
Okay. Um, pretty good.
I'll show you a trick.


940
00:54:13.125 --> 00:54:16.125
You gotta use as little paper as possible.

941
00:54:16.208 --> 00:54:20.791
Wrapping technique shouldn't require
more than three pieces of tape.


942
00:54:20.875 --> 00:54:21.958
So you do it like this,

943
00:54:23.041 --> 00:54:24.333
and then like that.

944
00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:28.000
And like this.

945
00:54:29.666 --> 00:54:31.166
Very good.

946
00:54:31.250 --> 00:54:32.583
Told you.

947
00:54:33.708 --> 00:54:36.625
- Jacob! I'm so happy you're here.
- Oh!


948
00:54:36.708 --> 00:54:39.500
Louise, you know I would never forget
my Christmas girlfriend.


949
00:54:39.583 --> 00:54:42.500
- It looks like you already have.
- This is Sarah.


950
00:54:43.125 --> 00:54:44.666
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.


951
00:54:44.750 --> 00:54:46.416
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.


952
00:54:46.500 --> 00:54:48.291
Jake!
We need help sorting things out!


953
00:54:48.375 --> 00:54:50.083
All right. Um, 
I'll be right back.

954
00:54:50.166 --> 00:54:53.125
You two... don't talk about me
while I'm gone.


955
00:54:53.208 --> 00:54:56.041
Hi. Can we drop our toys here?

956
00:54:56.125 --> 00:54:57.333
Hi, thank you.

957
00:54:58.250 --> 00:55:00.750
- Merry Christmas. Thank you so much.
- There you go.


958
00:55:03.708 --> 00:55:06.166
I don't know what we'd do
without Jake Russell.


959
00:55:06.250 --> 00:55:08.541
He volunteers. 
He donates money.

960
00:55:09.083 --> 00:55:12.291
I can't even count how many charities
he's helped out in town.


961
00:55:12.375 --> 00:55:14.291
I just wish that there was some way

962
00:55:14.375 --> 00:55:16.684
that Summit Springs
could show him how much he means to us.


963
00:55:16.708 --> 00:55:19.601
- Great job on this wrapping.
- I don't know if I did wrap...


964
00:55:24.916 --> 00:55:27.250
Again, thank you so much
for helping out tonight.


965
00:55:27.333 --> 00:55:30.333
Oh, thank you for inviting me.
Everyone was so nice.


966
00:55:32.041 --> 00:55:33.041
So...

967
00:55:34.958 --> 00:55:38.375
think you're going to remember any of this
when you get your memory back?


968
00:55:38.875 --> 00:55:40.125
I'll never forget it.

969
00:55:45.916 --> 00:55:48.041
We are standing under the mistletoe.

970
00:55:48.708 --> 00:55:50.333
Yes, we are.

971
00:56:01.333 --> 00:56:03.250
You know, maybe we shouldn't do this.

972
00:56:04.208 --> 00:56:06.041
I mean, what if you're with somebody.

973
00:56:06.666 --> 00:56:08.291
That would be unfortunate.

974
00:56:09.416 --> 00:56:10.416
For both of us.

975
00:56:14.583 --> 00:56:16.208
Yeah. Well...

976
00:56:55.041 --> 00:56:56.041
- I'm almost done.
- Yes.


977
00:56:56.125 --> 00:56:57.125
Morning!

978
00:56:57.916 --> 00:56:59.000
- Morning!
- Good morning.


979
00:56:59.083 --> 00:57:01.375
I have an idea
on how we can help the North Star.


980
00:57:04.416 --> 00:57:07.583
I've got the contacts
for almost every guest we've had


981
00:57:07.666 --> 00:57:09.333
over the past three decades.

982
00:57:09.416 --> 00:57:11.000
- This is perfect.
- Mm-hmm.


983
00:57:12.625 --> 00:57:13.625
What's it for?

984
00:57:13.666 --> 00:57:15.208
A North Star fundraiser.

985
00:57:15.833 --> 00:57:18.083
Cool. Have you talked to dad about it?

986
00:57:19.375 --> 00:57:21.000
No, absolutely not.

987
00:57:21.083 --> 00:57:22.583
- What?
- You heard me.


988
00:57:22.666 --> 00:57:25.625
There's no way I'm having a fundraiser
to save the lodge.


989
00:57:25.708 --> 00:57:27.291
No. It won't be a fundraiser.

990
00:57:27.375 --> 00:57:29.875
It'll be like a Christmas flashback party.

991
00:57:29.958 --> 00:57:32.333
And we'll invite all the guests
you've had over the years


992
00:57:32.416 --> 00:57:34.583
to celebrate their favorite
North Star memories.


993
00:57:35.166 --> 00:57:39.000
And, okay, yes, we'll ask for a donation,
but what's the big deal?


994
00:57:39.083 --> 00:57:41.416
The big deal is
I live in Summit Springs, okay?


995
00:57:41.500 --> 00:57:43.375
I don't want people
looking at me differently.


996
00:57:43.458 --> 00:57:45.291
I don't want them thinking
I need a handout.


997
00:57:45.791 --> 00:57:48.708
But you don't want to lose
the North Star either, do you?


998
00:57:51.833 --> 00:57:52.833
Maybe I do.

999
00:57:53.791 --> 00:57:54.833
You don't mean that.

1000
00:57:54.916 --> 00:57:57.083
Look, I'm tired of struggling
with this place.


1001
00:57:57.166 --> 00:57:59.375
I'm tired of everything
always breaking down.


1002
00:57:59.458 --> 00:58:02.500
I'm tired of wondering
how we'll make it to the end of the month.


1003
00:58:03.375 --> 00:58:06.000
Jake, you can't turn your back
on this lodge.


1004
00:58:06.083 --> 00:58:10.208
- Think about all the memories you've made.
- I do. I do. All the time.


1005
00:58:10.291 --> 00:58:12.811
And to be honest, you know,
I'd be happy to let some of them go.


1006
00:58:13.958 --> 00:58:16.958
And what do you know about memories?
You can't even remember your name.


1007
00:58:24.125 --> 00:58:25.250
Sarah, wait.

1008
00:58:25.333 --> 00:58:26.333
Okay, look, I...

1009
00:58:27.083 --> 00:58:28.416
It's not you.

1010
00:58:28.500 --> 00:58:30.458
Okay, actually, it is you.

1011
00:58:31.125 --> 00:58:32.916
Look, ever since you got here, you...

1012
00:58:34.333 --> 00:58:36.291
Well, you've made me feel things...

1013
00:58:36.791 --> 00:58:39.333
Things that I didn't ever think
I was ever going to feel again.


1014
00:58:40.250 --> 00:58:43.375
And, yes, you're right. This place
does have a lot of memories for me.


1015
00:58:45.125 --> 00:58:47.750
I guess I'm just, you know,
afraid of making


1016
00:58:48.250 --> 00:58:49.250
new ones,

1017
00:58:50.791 --> 00:58:52.458
even with somebody like you.

1018
00:59:05.375 --> 00:59:06.375
Come in.

1019
00:59:10.750 --> 00:59:12.000
Everything all right?

1020
00:59:12.916 --> 00:59:13.916
Yeah.

1021
00:59:15.333 --> 00:59:16.333
What's wrong?

1022
00:59:18.083 --> 00:59:19.416
Nothing. Nothing, just...

1023
00:59:19.500 --> 00:59:20.666
Is it Sarah?

1024
00:59:24.166 --> 00:59:25.791
I know it's hard,

1025
00:59:26.708 --> 00:59:28.416
especially this time of year.

1026
00:59:30.375 --> 00:59:31.375
I don't know.

1027
00:59:32.625 --> 00:59:36.416
I just... I don't really know
what I'm doing anymore.


1028
00:59:37.708 --> 00:59:41.541
You've been doing everything you can
to hold this family together.


1029
00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:45.833
But we are all right now.

1030
00:59:48.708 --> 00:59:49.708
Jake.

1031
00:59:51.791 --> 00:59:53.416
It's okay to let go.

1032
01:00:23.583 --> 01:00:26.458
Sarah. We're making snowflakes.
Want to come help me?


1033
01:00:26.541 --> 01:00:29.166
I'm sorry, I can't right now, Avy,
but maybe later.


1034
01:00:29.250 --> 01:00:31.166
Alejandra, can I talk
to you for a second?

1035
01:00:31.250 --> 01:00:32.083
Of course.

1036
01:00:32.166 --> 01:00:34.583
I think it's time for me to leave.

1037
01:00:34.666 --> 01:00:35.541
Oh.

1038
01:00:35.625 --> 01:00:38.625
Don't say that. You know you're welcome
to stay as long as it takes.


1039
01:00:38.708 --> 01:00:42.583
Yes, thank you, but I think
it's just best for everyone I just go.


1040
01:00:42.666 --> 01:00:44.125
Wait. What?

1041
01:00:44.791 --> 01:00:46.041
Sarah, are you leaving?

1042
01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:48.000
You can't be.

1043
01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:49.500
I'm afraid so.

1044
01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.500
But I thought you were gonna
stay with us for Christmas.


1045
01:00:52.583 --> 01:00:56.250
And I would love that,
but there's just been a change of plans.


1046
01:00:57.500 --> 01:00:59.833
Yes, they have changed.

1047
01:01:00.958 --> 01:01:01.958
Dad.

1048
01:01:02.541 --> 01:01:03.708
What is that?

1049
01:01:03.791 --> 01:01:06.000
Something I've been saving
for the right moment.


1050
01:01:07.583 --> 01:01:09.916
But we need Sarah to
help us put it up.

1051
01:01:12.833 --> 01:01:13.833
Please.

1052
01:01:14.833 --> 01:01:15.666
But you said...

1053
01:01:15.750 --> 01:01:17.875
I know, but I don't wanna do this
without you.


1054
01:01:31.083 --> 01:01:31.958
A little to the left.

1055
01:01:32.041 --> 01:01:34.541
- How about that?
- And... perfect.


1056
01:01:34.625 --> 01:01:36.416
It's beautiful, Jake.

1057
01:01:37.083 --> 01:01:38.833
You know what this place needs right now?

1058
01:01:38.916 --> 01:01:40.166
A Christmas party?

1059
01:01:40.666 --> 01:01:43.351
All right, let's do it! Let's go!

1060
01:01:43.375 --> 01:01:45.208
All right, a little bit closer together.

1061
01:01:45.291 --> 01:01:47.666
On the count of three, "Merry Christmas."

1062
01:01:47.750 --> 01:01:49.583
One, two, three.

1063
01:01:49.666 --> 01:01:51.583
Merry Christmas!

1064
01:01:52.541 --> 01:01:54.416
All right, you guys enjoy the slopes.

1065
01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:55.500
All right. Printing.

1066

<i>♪ It's a beautiful sight

1067
01:02:02.125 --> 01:02:04.208
Christmas Eve, come to North Star.

1068
01:02:04.291 --> 01:02:05.833
There's a Christmas Eve party.

1069
01:02:05.916 --> 01:02:09.541
Here you go. Merry Christmas.
Christmas party at the North Star.


1070
01:02:10.208 --> 01:02:11.208
Oh, yeah.

1071
01:02:12.083 --> 01:02:13.500
7:00 p.m., Christmas Eve.

1072
01:02:13.583 --> 01:02:15.503
- There's a party at the North Star.
- Thank you!


1073
01:02:15.583 --> 01:02:16.666
There.

1074
01:02:18.208 --> 01:02:21.750
It's December 24th. I know you probably
have plans, but we'll be there.


1075
01:02:24.750 --> 01:02:26.125

1077
01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:38.458
Yep, dinner's ready.

1078
01:02:38.541 --> 01:02:40.250
Time for some tasty beans.

1079
01:02:41.375 --> 01:02:42.833
- There you go, buddy.
- Oh!


1080
01:02:44.291 --> 01:02:45.958
- Thank you, my friend.
- Yeah.


1081
01:02:47.208 --> 01:02:48.333
Oh.

1082
01:02:49.208 --> 01:02:50.208
Mm.

1083
01:02:51.541 --> 01:02:54.500
These are the best canned beans

1084
01:02:55.750 --> 01:02:57.166
I've ever tasted.

1085
01:02:57.250 --> 01:03:00.250
Ralph! Have you considered
starting a survival blog?


1086
01:03:00.333 --> 01:03:02.458
I'm sure I could get you sponsored.

1087
01:03:02.541 --> 01:03:05.458
Well, thank you, Tad.
Wouldn't that be something?


1088
01:03:05.541 --> 01:03:06.541
Yeah.

1089
01:03:10.166 --> 01:03:11.416
Ho...

1090
01:03:11.500 --> 01:03:12.500
Hm.

1091
01:03:12.916 --> 01:03:14.083
Hot.

1092
01:03:14.166 --> 01:03:16.541
Yeah, they got a little kick.
It can sneak up on you.


1093
01:03:16.625 --> 01:03:18.375
Yep! Getting that kick now.

1094
01:03:19.083 --> 01:03:20.375
Hoo!

1095
01:03:20.958 --> 01:03:21.958
Big kick!

1096
01:03:23.041 --> 01:03:24.791
Not very sneaky.

1097
01:03:30.125 --> 01:03:31.333
He's walking in now.

1098
01:03:31.916 --> 01:03:35.125
Hi! I just got to the hotel.
So, give me a call when you get this.


1099
01:03:35.208 --> 01:03:36.416
Thank you, Morgan.

1100
01:03:36.500 --> 01:03:37.500
Terry?

1101
01:03:38.291 --> 01:03:40.708
Mr. Belmont.
Hello, you're back.


1102
01:03:40.791 --> 01:03:43.375
Hi. I need to talk to Sierra,
but she's not answering her phone.


1103
01:03:43.458 --> 01:03:46.208
- Have her meet me in my office.
- I'm sorry, Mr. Belmont.


1104
01:03:46.875 --> 01:03:48.333
I don't know where she is.

1105
01:03:49.791 --> 01:03:50.875
What?

1106
01:03:51.458 --> 01:03:53.833
I asked you to take care of her
while she was here.


1107
01:03:53.916 --> 01:03:56.458
Well, yes, but she and Mr. Fairchild
went skiing the other day,


1108
01:03:56.541 --> 01:03:58.791
and that's the last time
that I saw her. So...


1109
01:03:58.875 --> 01:04:02.791
"The other day"? Are you telling me
you haven't seen my daughter in four days?


1110
01:04:02.875 --> 01:04:05.458
Well, no, but I just thought
she and Mr. Fairchild


1111
01:04:05.541 --> 01:04:07.458
wanted a little private time together.

1112
01:04:07.541 --> 01:04:09.476
And she told me not to bother her.
Then... Well, I...


1113
01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:11.541
- We.
- We found this note.


1114
01:04:20.916 --> 01:04:23.500
My daughter never goes anywhere
without her luggage.


1115
01:04:24.250 --> 01:04:26.291
You, have the security team
check the grounds.


1116
01:04:26.375 --> 01:04:27.916
Search every inch of the resort.

1117
01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.583
- I'm on it.
- And you, call the Sheriff's Office.


1118
01:04:30.666 --> 01:04:32.625
Okay. What do I say?

1119
01:04:33.666 --> 01:04:35.666
You tell them that I want them
to find my daughter.


1120
01:04:36.708 --> 01:04:37.708
Right.

1121
01:04:57.166 --> 01:05:01.416
We're gonna need a search party.
Got some knuckleheads lost in the pass.


1122
01:05:01.500 --> 01:05:03.750
<i>Copy that.
Do we have any idea who it is?</i>


1123
01:05:06.750 --> 01:05:09.875
Yeah, it's Ralph. 
Poaching again.

1124
01:05:12.291 --> 01:05:13.291
Yeah?

1125
01:05:14.208 --> 01:05:15.791
Are you almost ready, dear?

1126
01:05:15.875 --> 01:05:18.708
I'm just trying to find something to wear.

1127
01:05:20.958 --> 01:05:23.791
Well, actually, that's why I'm here.

1128
01:05:23.875 --> 01:05:27.916
I took the liberty of picking up a little
something for you to wear tonight.


1129
01:05:28.416 --> 01:05:29.541
I hope it fits.

1130
01:05:29.625 --> 01:05:32.708
Oh my gosh. Thank you so much.
You didn't have to.


1131
01:05:32.791 --> 01:05:34.333
I wanted to.

1132
01:05:35.208 --> 01:05:36.708
You make Jake smile.

1133
01:05:37.625 --> 01:05:39.708
He hasn't done that in a long time.

1134
01:05:42.166 --> 01:05:45.208
Oh! I brought you
a pair of shoes too.

1135
01:05:45.291 --> 01:05:46.416
Thank you.

1136
01:05:48.833 --> 01:05:49.833
Hmm.

1137
01:05:50.625 --> 01:05:52.333
- See you downstairs?
- Okay.


1138
01:05:58.708 --> 01:06:00.948
Ralph, I'm afraid we're gonna have
to book you this time.


1139
01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:04.541
What? This is an outrage!
That man is a hero.


1140
01:06:04.625 --> 01:06:08.041
- He was poaching on government land.
- He saved my life.


1141
01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.041
You'll have to arrest me too.

1142
01:06:11.125 --> 01:06:12.291
Ted?

1143
01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:14.541
Beau!

1144
01:06:15.666 --> 01:06:16.916
What are you doing here?

1145
01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:20.041
- Oh, it's a long and terrifying tale.
- Where's my daughter?


1146
01:06:20.125 --> 01:06:22.041
I don't know. I expect at the hotel?

1147
01:06:22.125 --> 01:06:25.541
No, she's not at the hotel. And I was
told she's supposed to be with you.


1148
01:06:25.625 --> 01:06:28.916
Well, she was, but then we got separated
when we were up on the mountain.


1149
01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.916
- I had just proposed to her.
- Proposed?


1150
01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:32.666
- Uh-huh.
- "Marriage" proposed?


1151
01:06:32.750 --> 01:06:33.750
Yeah.

1152
01:06:34.666 --> 01:06:38.666
- Looks like I'll be calling you "Dad."
- Hey, congratulations.


1153
01:06:38.750 --> 01:06:41.375
- Thank you, friend.
- I know where she is. Come on.


1154
01:06:41.458 --> 01:06:43.500
W
-W
-W
-Wait. What about Ralph?

1155
01:06:44.625 --> 01:06:46.375
Jasper, let him go.

1156
01:06:47.458 --> 01:06:48.458
It's Christmas.

1157
01:06:49.041 --> 01:06:50.791
Well, hey, thank you, Tad.

1158
01:06:50.875 --> 01:06:52.291
Let's keep in touch, buddy.

1159
01:06:59.291 --> 01:07:00.666
Your bracelets.

1160
01:07:01.416 --> 01:07:02.656
Hey, what are you doing?

1161
01:07:03.916 --> 01:07:05.083
Just checking.

1162
01:07:05.166 --> 01:07:07.750
You know that that says,
"Do not open until Christmas."


1163
01:07:07.833 --> 01:07:08.875
I'm watching you.

1164
01:07:11.750 --> 01:07:15.208
Jake, do you think we have enough food?
I don't want to run out.


1165
01:07:15.291 --> 01:07:17.666
I don't think it's gonna be a problem.
It's Christmas Eve.


1166
01:07:17.750 --> 01:07:20.916
People got things to do.
It's a very last-minute party, so...


1167
01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:22.500
It's late, and no one's here yet.

1168
01:07:22.583 --> 01:07:25.625
Don't give up, Jake.
You just need a little bit of faith.


1169
01:07:31.208 --> 01:07:32.208
Wow!

1170
01:07:32.541 --> 01:07:33.541
Sarah.

1171
01:07:34.666 --> 01:07:36.250
I love your dress.

1172
01:07:38.166 --> 01:07:39.208
You look...

1173
01:07:39.708 --> 01:07:40.708
Beautiful.

1174
01:07:41.458 --> 01:07:43.916
Thank you. Alejandra bought it for me.

1175
01:07:44.625 --> 01:07:46.250
It's lovely on you.

1176
01:07:47.291 --> 01:07:51.250
Avy, sweetheart, why don't you
come help me make some more appetizers.


1177
01:07:51.333 --> 01:07:53.500
- But Dad said we don't need any more.
- Avy.


1178
01:08:01.250 --> 01:08:02.250
So...

1179
01:08:02.333 --> 01:08:05.500
So, everything's ready for tonight?

1180
01:08:05.583 --> 01:08:07.333
Yeah, I think so. Um...

1181
01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:09.000
You wanna

1182
01:08:09.500 --> 01:08:10.833
do a final inspection?

1183
01:08:11.416 --> 01:08:12.416
Sure.

1184
01:08:15.708 --> 01:08:18.208
Oh, the place looks great.

1185
01:08:18.791 --> 01:08:20.791
Yeah. Moved out a bunch of the tables,

1186
01:08:20.875 --> 01:08:23.541
put in a little
dance floor, just in case.

1187
01:08:25.708 --> 01:08:27.416
Maybe we should test it out?

1188
01:08:28.250 --> 01:08:30.208
I'm not sure if I can dance, but...

all the way up.

01:10:13.916 --> 01:10:17.166
No, no. I'm not gonna get up there.
I wouldn't know what to say.

01:10:47.041 --> 01:10:49.666
Good point. Um... 
Okay, well, anyway.

1233
01:10:49.750 --> 01:10:52.833
Thank you all, uh, for being here tonight.

1234
01:10:54.833 --> 01:10:55.833
You can do this.

1235
01:10:55.916 --> 01:10:57.583
I just wanted to say...

1236
01:10:58.291 --> 01:10:59.291
Um...

1237
01:11:01.166 --> 01:11:04.750
Well, the thing is, the North Star, uh...

1238
01:11:07.375 --> 01:11:10.333
Well, there is this situation, and, uh...

1239
01:11:13.833 --> 01:11:15.208
I... I can't do this.

1240
01:11:15.291 --> 01:11:21.375
You know, I remember the first time
our family came to the North Star Lodge.


1241
01:11:22.291 --> 01:11:25.416
You took my son under your wing
and taught him to ski.


1242
01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:28.000
And I will admit,
he wasn't a quick study.

1243
01:11:29.458 --> 01:11:31.833
No. He was... He was not.

1244
01:11:32.458 --> 01:11:33.791
He's a Ski Patrol now.

1245
01:11:35.166 --> 01:11:39.916
Anyway, I, uh, figured I owe you this much
for ski lessons.


1246
01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:41.125
Sorry it's late.

1247
01:11:41.208 --> 01:11:43.375
Howard, I... I can't. That's...

1248
01:11:44.125 --> 01:11:45.333
Wow, I...

1249
01:11:45.416 --> 01:11:48.708
When we got married,
we could not afford a honeymoon.


1250
01:11:49.375 --> 01:11:52.041
Jake, you gave us the biggest suite
in the place for the weekend,


1251
01:11:52.125 --> 01:11:55.958
champagne and everything,
and you wouldn't take a dime for it, so...


1252
01:11:56.041 --> 01:11:58.500
We want to give you... this.

1253
01:12:00.083 --> 01:12:02.791
Thank you for this. 
Thank you so much.

1254
01:12:03.583 --> 01:12:04.663
Thank you, guys. Thank you.

1255
01:12:04.708 --> 01:12:07.833
I think this is good a time as any
to make a little announcement of my own.


1256
01:12:08.666 --> 01:12:12.375
Summit Springs town council
has put forth a proposal


1257
01:12:12.458 --> 01:12:15.041
to have the North Star Lodge
declared a historic site.


1258
01:12:18.083 --> 01:12:19.083
Oh, wow.

1259
01:12:21.500 --> 01:12:24.958
Now that should help a bit with funds
and grants for renovations and so forth.


1260
01:12:25.458 --> 01:12:26.708
Now, on a personal note...

1261
01:12:28.750 --> 01:12:32.000
Well, here's for that time
you towed my car out of that snowbank.


1262
01:12:32.083 --> 01:12:35.250
Oh my gosh. I can't believe
you remembered that.


1263
01:12:36.333 --> 01:12:37.750
You're a good man, Jake.

1264
01:12:37.833 --> 01:12:39.875
Thank you so much, wow.

1265
01:12:39.958 --> 01:12:40.998
We love you, Jake.

1266
01:12:41.041 --> 01:12:42.208
Thank you so much.

1267
01:12:42.291 --> 01:12:43.892
- Thank you, guys.
- Happy holidays.


1268
01:12:43.916 --> 01:12:44.916
- Gosh.
- Merry Christmas.


1269
01:12:44.958 --> 01:12:47.083
Guys, thank you so much. 
Merry Christmas.

1270
01:12:47.166 --> 01:12:48.958
- Merry Christmas, Jake.
- Thank you.


1271
01:12:49.041 --> 01:12:50.250
Thank you, everyone.

1272
01:12:50.333 --> 01:12:52.375
- You deserve it.
- Merry Christmas.


1273
01:12:52.458 --> 01:12:54.750
- Thank you.
- We love the North Star.


1274
01:12:54.833 --> 01:12:57.041
We're happy to do
something for you for a change.


1275
01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:04.833
I really...

1276
01:13:04.916 --> 01:13:07.166
I really don't know what to say. Gosh.

1277
01:13:08.500 --> 01:13:09.791
It's all, uh...

1278
01:13:10.916 --> 01:13:13.166
It's all a little overwhelming for me
right now. Um...


1279
01:13:14.041 --> 01:13:16.291
I would like to
say one thing, though. Um...

1280
01:13:16.375 --> 01:13:18.416
None of this here tonight
would be possible


1281
01:13:18.500 --> 01:13:21.333
if it weren't for a very special guest

1282
01:13:21.416 --> 01:13:23.666
that we have staying here at the lodge.

1283
01:13:24.250 --> 01:13:26.166
She's changed the way I see, uh...

1284
01:13:27.500 --> 01:13:28.916
a lot of things, um,

1285
01:13:30.541 --> 01:13:32.208
not the least of which is myself.

1286
01:13:32.291 --> 01:13:35.125
So, can we just, uh...
Can we get her up here? Uh...


1287
01:13:36.791 --> 01:13:38.541
Will you come up here for a second?

1288
01:13:40.166 --> 01:13:43.041
Everybody, would you please give
a big thank you to...


1289
01:13:43.125 --> 01:13:44.500
Sierra!

1290
01:13:44.583 --> 01:13:48.166
I found you at last! Darling!

1291
01:13:49.458 --> 01:13:50.458
Look at you.

1292
01:13:50.500 --> 01:13:53.250
I've searched,
and I've searched.


1293
01:13:53.333 --> 01:13:55.708
There you go. Reunited for Christmas.

1294
01:13:56.291 --> 01:13:58.000
So your name is Sierra.

1295
01:13:58.083 --> 01:14:00.125
Yes. My daughter.

1296
01:14:00.208 --> 01:14:02.088
- What did he say?
- His daughter?


1297
01:14:02.125 --> 01:14:03.125
Sierra.

1298
01:14:04.041 --> 01:14:05.583
I remember that name.

1299
01:14:08.875 --> 01:14:10.250
That's my name.

1300
01:14:10.333 --> 01:14:12.416
Well, of course it's your name.

1301
01:14:13.333 --> 01:14:14.166
Who are you?

1302
01:14:14.250 --> 01:14:17.791
Hello? It's me Tad Fairchild, your fiancé.

1303
01:14:18.708 --> 01:14:20.125
- I'm engaged?
- Yeah.


1304
01:14:20.208 --> 01:14:23.791
You're... Mr. Belmont's daughter?

1305
01:14:25.583 --> 01:14:26.583
Dad.

1306
01:14:26.625 --> 01:14:28.208
Yes. Yes, honey.

1307
01:14:32.916 --> 01:14:35.208
And I've met you before. Last week.

1308
01:14:35.291 --> 01:14:37.750
- Um... Mr. Russell?
- Yeah, Jake.


1309
01:14:37.833 --> 01:14:39.875
And I
-I... I... Sorry, I...

1310
01:14:40.833 --> 01:14:42.208
I didn't know who you were.

1311
01:14:42.791 --> 01:14:43.916
I didn't remember.

1312
01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.583
I bet you'll remember this.

1313
01:14:51.208 --> 01:14:52.208
It's too big.

1314
01:14:53.333 --> 01:14:55.333
- I think I told you that, right?
- Mm-hmm.


1315
01:14:55.833 --> 01:14:57.708
Tad.

1316
01:14:57.791 --> 01:15:01.083
I was skiing, and I... and I fell,
and I hit a tree.


1317
01:15:02.166 --> 01:15:03.666
And then I ended up here,

1318
01:15:04.291 --> 01:15:05.375
with you.

1319
01:15:06.041 --> 01:15:07.041
Jake.

1320
01:15:08.291 --> 01:15:09.291
With you.

1321
01:15:13.416 --> 01:15:15.250
I have no idea what's transpired here,

1322
01:15:15.333 --> 01:15:17.958
but clearly, you've taken
very good care of my daughter.


1323
01:15:18.041 --> 01:15:19.625
And I appreciate that a great deal.

1324
01:15:19.708 --> 01:15:22.333
Let's get you back to the hotel,
okay, sweetie?


1325
01:15:22.416 --> 01:15:24.958
Nice, hot bath, maybe some champagne
to help clear your head.


1326
01:15:25.041 --> 01:15:26.767
Yeah, the hotel.
I should get back...


1327
01:15:26.791 --> 01:15:28.125
That's right.

1328
01:15:28.208 --> 01:15:29.291
Sarah, wait!

1329
01:15:32.500 --> 01:15:33.666
I don't want you to go.

1330
01:15:33.750 --> 01:15:35.750
I'm so sorry, sweetie.

1331
01:15:36.708 --> 01:15:38.041
But I have to go home.

1332
01:15:38.125 --> 01:15:39.375
Come on, honey.

1333
01:15:47.166 --> 01:15:48.625
I don't even know what to say.

1334
01:15:50.083 --> 01:15:51.250
Thank you so much.

1335
01:15:52.125 --> 01:15:53.958
Yeah. Forget about it.

Miss Belmont? Are you up yet?

1361
01:17:39.291 --> 01:17:40.291
I'm up.

1362
01:17:40.625 --> 01:17:43.041
Mr. Fairchild just wanted me to remind you

1363
01:17:43.125 --> 01:17:46.041
that he's arranged a press conference
in two hours.


1364
01:17:46.125 --> 01:17:47.666
There's been quite a... Ooh! Sparkly.

1365
01:17:47.750 --> 01:17:49.000
Oh, you can come in.

1366
01:17:49.500 --> 01:17:53.583
Uh, there's been quite a bit
of media attention for your ordeal.


1367
01:17:54.958 --> 01:17:57.333
Miss Belmont, what are you doing?

1368
01:17:57.416 --> 01:18:00.000
Oh, I'm just helping
the housekeepers out a bit.


1369
01:18:00.083 --> 01:18:02.166
It is Christmas after all.

1370
01:18:02.250 --> 01:18:03.875
Are you feeling all right?

1371
01:18:03.958 --> 01:18:05.083
Yeah.

1372
01:18:05.166 --> 01:18:07.416
I found this gorgeous piece,
just flown in from Milan.


1373
01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:09.583
I think I'm gonna go simple today.

1374
01:18:09.666 --> 01:18:10.750
Oh, okay.

1375
01:18:10.833 --> 01:18:11.708
Thank you.

1376
01:18:11.791 --> 01:18:13.208
Caviar?

1377
01:18:13.791 --> 01:18:16.458
Actually, I'm in the mood
for something different this morning.


1378
01:18:16.541 --> 01:18:17.741
She's not acting like herself.

1379
01:18:17.791 --> 01:18:19.431
- I thought you should know.
- That's odd.


1380
01:18:19.458 --> 01:18:22.791
Hope her experience at that dreadful
hostel hasn't traumatized her.


1381
01:18:22.875 --> 01:18:23.875
Wait for it.

1382
01:18:30.125 --> 01:18:31.750
Sierra, what are you doing?

1383
01:18:31.833 --> 01:18:33.583
I'm making breakfast.

1384
01:18:33.666 --> 01:18:36.250
But, darling, the press conference
is in 30 minutes.


1385
01:18:36.333 --> 01:18:38.000
You need to get dressed.

1386
01:18:39.500 --> 01:18:40.500
I am dressed.

1387
01:18:44.333 --> 01:18:45.333
Mm.

1388
01:18:45.375 --> 01:18:46.500
Mm-mm.

1389
01:18:47.083 --> 01:18:48.083
Mm.

1390
01:18:56.125 --> 01:18:57.125
Dad!

1391
01:18:58.166 --> 01:18:59.291
Thank you!

1392
01:18:59.375 --> 01:19:01.708
Oh! You are welcome.

1393
01:19:01.791 --> 01:19:02.916
I love my book.

1394
01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:04.458
So glad you like it.

1395
01:19:04.541 --> 01:19:06.375
I'm gonna try them on right now.

1396
01:19:06.458 --> 01:19:08.833
Thank you so much for my awesome helmet!

1397
01:19:09.333 --> 01:19:11.213
All right.
I'm just gonna clean up a little bit.


1398
01:19:11.250 --> 01:19:12.250
Me too.

1399
01:19:17.041 --> 01:19:19.333
People were very generous last night.

1400
01:19:19.416 --> 01:19:20.500
Yeah, they were.

1401
01:19:21.583 --> 01:19:24.583
I don't think it's gonna make a difference
if we don't get any reservations.


1402
01:19:24.666 --> 01:19:25.958
Yeah, you're right.

1403
01:19:26.458 --> 01:19:28.250
And we're gonna need a Christmas miracle.

1404
01:19:28.333 --> 01:19:30.583
<i>- This breaking news is just in.</i>
- Dad!


1405
01:19:30.666 --> 01:19:32.416
<i>Missing heiress Sierra Belmont,</i>

1410

<i>Miss Belmont. Would you tell us
in your own words what happened?</i>


1411
01:19:41.291 --> 01:19:43.500
<i>Before I answer any questions,</i>

1412
01:19:43.583 --> 01:19:47.500
<i>I would like to thank Jake Russell
and his family at the North Star Lodge.</i>


1413
01:19:47.583 --> 01:19:50.541
<i>They took very good care of me
at their charming ski resort.</i>


1414
01:19:51.041 --> 01:19:52.375
And I highly recommend it.

1415
01:19:52.458 --> 01:19:54.458
That's the North Star Lodge.

1416
01:19:54.500 --> 01:19:56.380
Ms. Belmont, what are your plans
for the future?


1417
01:19:56.416 --> 01:20:00.250
Let me answer that by showing you... this.

1418
01:20:01.291 --> 01:20:03.125
- Tell us about the proposal.
- Mr. Fairchild?


1419
01:20:03.208 --> 01:20:05.500
- Just one more question.
- Does this mean you're eloping?


1420
01:20:05.583 --> 01:20:06.708
<i>Isn't it beautiful?</i>

1421
01:20:06.791 --> 01:20:08.333
<i>Who designed the ring?</i>

1422
01:20:08.416 --> 01:20:10.166
<i>It's by Jefferson Diamonds.</i>

1423
01:20:10.250 --> 01:20:13.041
#JeffersonJewelryForYou.

1424
01:20:13.125 --> 01:20:14.125
So, you're engaged.

1425
01:20:14.166 --> 01:20:17.041
Mr. Fairchild has asked me to marry him.

1426
01:20:17.125 --> 01:20:19.125
- But I...
- You must be excited, Mr. Belmont.


1427
01:20:19.208 --> 01:20:20.333
Oh, um...

1428
01:20:21.041 --> 01:20:23.875
Excited doesn't come close
to describing how I feel.


1429
01:20:24.958 --> 01:20:26.416
And when's the big day?

1430
01:20:27.958 --> 01:20:29.208
That's still in discussion.

1431
01:20:29.291 --> 01:20:30.375
<i>We're keeping that secret.</i>

1432
01:20:30.458 --> 01:20:32.750
<i>Actually, we're catching a plane
in a couple of hours</i>


1433
01:20:32.833 --> 01:20:34.750
<i>to an undisclosed destination.</i>

1434
01:20:34.833 --> 01:20:36.416
<i>So, don't know if...</i>

1435
01:20:37.208 --> 01:20:38.976
I think we've seen enough.

1436
01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:40.040
I'll get that.

1437
01:20:46.041 --> 01:20:48.708
Guess my Christmas wish
didn't come true after all.


1438
01:20:49.666 --> 01:20:51.208
What do you mean, sweetie?

1439
01:20:54.875 --> 01:20:57.125
When Grandma and I
were at The Wishing Tree,


1440
01:20:57.208 --> 01:20:58.958
I didn't make a wish for myself.

1441
01:20:59.791 --> 01:21:01.041
I made it for you, Dad.

1442
01:21:01.125 --> 01:21:03.416
You gave your wish up for me?

1443
01:21:03.500 --> 01:21:05.875
I wished for you
to find someone to love.

1444
01:21:06.916 --> 01:21:08.916
You take such good
care of all of us.

1445
01:21:09.500 --> 01:21:12.750
I just wanted you to have someone
take care of you too.


1446
01:21:13.541 --> 01:21:15.916
Someone like Sarah.

1447
01:21:17.625 --> 01:21:20.041
Avy, honey, um... I just...
It's just not that easy.


1448
01:21:20.125 --> 01:21:23.250
Sure, it is. You like her, don't you?

1449
01:21:24.166 --> 01:21:26.666
- Well, yeah, but it's not...
- Did you ever tell her?


1450
01:21:28.791 --> 01:21:30.416
Not in so many words, no.

1451
01:21:30.500 --> 01:21:31.916
There's still time, Dad.

1452
01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:34.625
I think you should tell her.

1453
01:21:35.625 --> 01:21:39.083
- Go get dressed. Go tell her. Let's go!
- Okay, all right.


1454
01:21:39.166 --> 01:21:41.375
The roads are closed
at this end of the valley.


1455
01:21:41.458 --> 01:21:42.708
I'll take the snowmobile!

1456
01:21:47.875 --> 01:21:48.958
Maybe not.

1457
01:21:51.250 --> 01:21:52.250
Dad?

1458
01:21:53.125 --> 01:21:54.250
What is that?

1459
01:21:56.250 --> 01:21:57.083
What is that?

1460
01:22:00.833 --> 01:22:01.833
Whoa!

1461
01:22:01.916 --> 01:22:03.375
What is this doing here?

1462
01:22:03.458 --> 01:22:06.875
- Did you and Grandma do this?
- No. Where did it come from?


1463
01:22:07.916 --> 01:22:10.625
I don't know. I'll go get Balthazar.
You coming?


1464
01:22:10.708 --> 01:22:12.125
- You bet!
- All right.


1465
01:22:13.458 --> 01:22:14.875
My Christmas wish.

1466
01:22:16.083 --> 01:22:17.750
It is coming true.

1467
01:22:23.875 --> 01:22:27.250
A couple of hours from now, we'll be
taking selfies on a beautiful beach.


1468
01:22:27.333 --> 01:22:28.666
You know what? 
You go on ahead.

1469
01:22:28.750 --> 01:22:31.250
- Um, I'll meet you at the car.
- Don't be too long.


1470
01:22:31.333 --> 01:22:33.291
- I won't.
- Don't want to miss the flight.


1471
01:22:33.875 --> 01:22:34.875
Daddy?

1472
01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.416
I'm really sorry
I didn't get a chance to tell you


1473
01:22:39.500 --> 01:22:41.708
about me and Tad, the engagement.

1474
01:22:41.791 --> 01:22:42.916
Oh, it's okay, honey.

1475
01:22:44.125 --> 01:22:47.208
You know, the most important thing to me
is that you're happy.


1476
01:22:47.958 --> 01:22:49.541
You are happy, aren't you?

1477
01:22:49.625 --> 01:22:50.625
Yeah.

1478
01:22:51.500 --> 01:22:52.375
About the job.

1479
01:22:52.458 --> 01:22:55.375
Don't worry about the job.
It'll be here when you get back.


1480
01:22:55.458 --> 01:22:58.000
That's the thing. 
I don't want it to be.

1481
01:22:58.708 --> 01:22:59.958
I don't understand.

1482
01:23:00.041 --> 01:23:03.958
Vice President of Atmosphere?
You just did that to take care of me.


1483
01:23:04.041 --> 01:23:06.500
Well, maybe a little, but I...

1484
01:23:06.583 --> 01:23:09.208
And I love you for it,
and I'll always be your daughter.


1485
01:23:09.708 --> 01:23:13.833
I just... I need to find my own way.
I hope you're not angry.


1486
01:23:13.916 --> 01:23:14.791
Angry?

1487
01:23:16.500 --> 01:23:17.500
No.

1488
01:23:18.625 --> 01:23:20.916
I don't think I've ever been
more proud of you.


1489
01:23:21.750 --> 01:23:22.750
Really?

1490
01:23:22.791 --> 01:23:25.151
I told you I promised your mother
that I'd take care of you.


1491
01:23:26.708 --> 01:23:27.708
Well...

1492
01:23:28.791 --> 01:23:31.166
Looks like you're starting
to take care of yourself.


1493
01:23:32.541 --> 01:23:33.541
I love you, Dad.

1494
01:23:35.625 --> 01:23:36.625
I love you too.

1495
01:23:37.625 --> 01:23:39.416
Your mother would be so proud of you.

1496
01:23:39.916 --> 01:23:41.333
Thanks, Daddy.

1497
01:23:43.916 --> 01:23:44.916
Okay.

1498
01:23:47.500 --> 01:23:48.500
All right.

1499
01:23:52.750 --> 01:23:54.791
Merry Christmas, 
North Star Lodge.

1500
01:23:54.875 --> 01:23:57.035
<i>- ...place on the news?</i>
- Yes, this is the place.


1501
01:23:57.083 --> 01:23:58.843
<i>- I need a reservation.</i>
- For how many?


1502
01:23:59.416 --> 01:24:00.250
When?

1503
01:24:00.333 --> 01:24:03.208
Oh, may I place you
on hold for a moment?

1504
01:24:03.291 --> 01:24:04.166
Thank you.

1505
01:24:04.250 --> 01:24:06.250
Merry Christmas, 
North Star Lodge.

1506
01:24:06.333 --> 01:24:08.541
<i>Is this the place
where Sierra Belmont was?</i>


1507
01:24:08.625 --> 01:24:11.541
Yes, this is the place
where Sierra Belmont stayed.


1508
01:24:11.625 --> 01:24:13.875
Oh, yes. For how many?

1509
01:24:14.500 --> 01:24:16.458
Oh! Uh...

1510
01:24:16.958 --> 01:24:18.166
North Star Lodge?

1511
01:24:20.041 --> 01:24:21.208
Oh my goodness.

1512
01:24:22.208 --> 01:24:23.416
Can you hold, please?

1513
01:24:23.500 --> 01:24:25.916
Let's go, Balthazar! Good boy!

1514
01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:30.125
Alejandra, hey!

1515
01:24:30.208 --> 01:24:33.083
- The phone is lighting up like Christmas.
<i>- You're kidding.</i>


1516
01:24:33.166 --> 01:24:34.166
Jake...

1517
01:24:34.708 --> 01:24:36.125
we're sold out!

1518
01:24:40.500 --> 01:24:42.000
Oh. Can I get you anything?

1519
01:24:42.500 --> 01:24:44.083
My jacket, maybe?

1520
01:24:45.458 --> 01:24:47.375
- Yeah, 'cause winter is like...
- Yeah.


1521
01:24:47.458 --> 01:24:48.458
Okay.

1522
01:24:51.875 --> 01:24:54.291
Sierra! Ready to go, darling?

1523
01:24:59.458 --> 01:25:00.583
What are you doing?

1524
01:25:01.083 --> 01:25:02.083
I'm sorry, Tad.

1525
01:25:02.583 --> 01:25:06.083
You're a great guy,
but I'm just not ready for this yet.


1526
01:25:06.166 --> 01:25:08.208
I thought I was, but I'm not.

1527
01:25:13.708 --> 01:25:15.416
Are you breaking up with me?

1528
01:25:16.500 --> 01:25:17.500
On Christmas Day?

1529
01:25:18.791 --> 01:25:21.750
I know you, Tad.
You'll be okay by New Year's.


1530
01:25:21.833 --> 01:25:22.833
Huh.

1531
01:25:26.125 --> 01:25:28.333
Do you mind if I post about this
on my page?


1532
01:25:28.416 --> 01:25:30.458
My followers will love it.

1533
01:25:30.541 --> 01:25:33.166
Nothing like a breakup
to really add to your numbers.


1534
01:25:35.833 --> 01:25:37.333
Merry Christmas, Tad.

1535
01:25:41.708 --> 01:25:42.708
Good luck to you.

1536
01:25:47.083 --> 01:25:51.083
I am so sorry, Mr. Fairchild.

1537
01:25:51.166 --> 01:25:54.250
Oh! And at the holidays too. Oh.

1538
01:25:56.166 --> 01:25:58.041
You. Terry.

1539
01:25:58.125 --> 01:25:59.125
Yep.

1540
01:25:59.583 --> 01:26:01.458
What are you doing for New Year's?

1541
01:26:08.708 --> 01:26:09.708
Whoa!

1542
01:26:10.416 --> 01:26:12.333
All right.
Are you okay to watch Balthazar?


1543
01:26:12.416 --> 01:26:13.934
- Of course. Go find Sarah.
- All right.


1544
01:26:13.958 --> 01:26:15.208
Wait!

1545
01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.041
Much better.

1546
01:26:23.083 --> 01:26:25.666
Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!
Stop the car. Don't move.


1547
01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:28.000
Hold on!

1548
01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.333
Look, can you just give me...
give me one second.


1549
01:26:37.083 --> 01:26:40.166
Look, okay, I... I know
we barely know each other,


1550
01:26:40.250 --> 01:26:42.708
and you'll probably gonna think
I'm crazy for saying this.


1551
01:26:46.458 --> 01:26:49.833
But I... I can't let you leave without
telling you I'm falling in love with you.


1552
01:26:54.083 --> 01:26:58.416
Well, that's very flattering,
but I have other plans.


1553
01:27:00.583 --> 01:27:01.833
Happy Christmas.

1554
01:27:03.625 --> 01:27:04.750
Happy Christmas.

1555
01:27:10.750 --> 01:27:11.958
Uh, excuse me, son.

1556
01:27:13.125 --> 01:27:16.541
I believe what you're looking for
is in the back courtyard.


1557
01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:33.916
- Sierra!
- Jake?


1558
01:27:39.166 --> 01:27:40.541
I thought you were leaving.

1559
01:27:41.291 --> 01:27:44.208
Uh, no, change of plans. 
I'm staying here

1560
01:27:44.291 --> 01:27:45.208
without Tad.

1561
01:27:45.291 --> 01:27:46.291
You are?

1562
01:27:46.708 --> 01:27:47.750
Uh-huh.

1563
01:27:48.958 --> 01:27:51.291
So, what are you doing here?

1564
01:27:54.250 --> 01:27:57.166
Uh... I... I just
wanted to say thank you.

1565
01:27:57.250 --> 01:28:00.458
I just found out the North Star
is sold out for the rest of the season.


1566
01:28:00.541 --> 01:28:02.541
Really? Hm. Sold out, huh?

1567
01:28:03.083 --> 01:28:05.243
Sounds like you might need
some help running the place.


1568
01:28:05.291 --> 01:28:07.125
That would be amazing.

1569
01:28:07.208 --> 01:28:10.083
Well, my dad did also mention
investing in the North Star,


1570
01:28:10.166 --> 01:28:11.958
but I didn't think you'd be interested.

1571
01:28:12.041 --> 01:28:13.125
Right.

1572
01:28:13.625 --> 01:28:16.875
I did say I would try to convince you
over the holidays.


1573
01:28:17.541 --> 01:28:20.541
That is, if you wouldn't mind
spending them with me.


1574
01:28:23.083 --> 01:28:24.833
Well, you know what? Um...

1575
01:28:24.916 --> 01:28:27.083
There is this holiday tradition.

1576
01:28:27.166 --> 01:28:28.958
But I bumped my head
on the way over here,

1577
01:28:29.041 --> 01:28:31.291
and for the life of me,
I can't remember what it is.


1578
01:28:31.375 --> 01:28:33.208
It's, uh...

1579
01:28:33.791 --> 01:28:36.125
Yeah, I think
I can help you out with that.


1580
01:28:38.166 --> 01:28:39.000
Oh.

1581
01:28:51.250 --> 01:28:52.375
There they are.

1582
01:28:52.458 --> 01:28:53.625
Sierra!

1583
01:28:57.041 --> 01:28:58.958
- You didn't leave after all.
- Hey!


1584
01:28:59.041 --> 01:29:00.375
Hey.

1585
01:29:06.375 --> 01:29:07.375
What, um...

1586
01:29:07.875 --> 01:29:08.958
What happened to Ted?

1587
01:29:09.041 --> 01:29:12.666
Oh, it's Tad, Daddy.
And, uh... It wasn't meant to be.


1588
01:29:12.750 --> 01:29:15.541
- Happy you're here, Jake.
- It's good to see you, Mr. Belmont.


1589
01:29:17.125 --> 01:29:20.333
- What a Christmas, guys.
- Yeah, it's one I'll never forget.


1590
01:29:22.791 --> 01:29:25.250
And I see you've met my daughter, Avy...

1591
01:29:34.666 --> 01:29:37.125
Merry Christmas!

1592
01:29:37.208 --> 01:29:39.208
Merry Christmas!

1593
01:29:46.250 --> 01:29:49.125
Tad, I told you a place in the lobby.
Where are you?


1594
01:29:49.791 --> 01:29:51.125
Oh my gosh.

1595
01:29:52.958 --> 01:29:54.583
Shoot. Oh my God.

1596
01:29:57.958 --> 01:29:59.438
I'm so sorry. I didn't see you there.

1597
01:30:00.250 --> 01:30:01.625
It's chaos.

1598
01:30:01.708 --> 01:30:03.750
Nothing. We're rolling.

1599
01:30:06.166 --> 01:30:07.458
Mm.

1600
01:30:08.666 --> 01:30:09.666
Let's go!

1601
01:30:10.208 --> 01:30:12.041
Come on! Moving skis. 
Okay, let's do it.

1602
01:30:12.125 --> 01:30:14.250
- We're not gonna act.
- Yeah, yeah.


1603
01:30:14.791 --> 01:30:16.791
You've made a Christmas wish without me?

1604
01:30:21.291 --> 01:30:24.458
This is so beautiful.
Why don't you put it on the tree?


1605
01:30:24.541 --> 01:30:26.833
On Dasher! On Dancer!

1606
01:30:35.833 --> 01:30:37.250
- So?
- Hey!


1607
01:30:40.666 --> 01:30:41.500
Giddy-up!

1608
01:30:41.583 --> 01:30:44.000
Tad, it's not voice-activated!
Get me off of this thing!


1609
01:30:44.083 --> 01:30:45.083
You're ridiculous!

1610
01:30:47.875 --> 01:30:50.500
<i>Un, deux, trois!</i>

1611
01:30:51.708 --> 01:30:53.000
Oh!

1612
01:30:56.291 --> 01:30:57.500
Oh, my hands!

1613
01:30:57.583 --> 01:30:59.750
- What's your name, savior?
- Ralph.


1614
01:31:03.500 --> 01:31:04.500
What?

1615
01:31:05.208 --> 01:31:06.208
Sorry.

1616
01:31:06.291 --> 01:31:08.125
- I'm sorry, smiling.
- I'm sorry.


1617
01:31:08.208 --> 01:31:10.458
Blinking the whole time?

1618
01:31:10.541 --> 01:31:13.708
I'm not used to seeing women here
at the lodge.


1619
01:31:14.500 --> 01:31:16.416
Reindeer!

1620
01:31:18.541 --> 01:31:20.958
We landed on the Moon!

1621
01:31:21.458 --> 01:31:23.125
<i>♪ Oh, what fun... ♪</i>

1622
01:31:23.208 --> 01:31:25.541
You're off-key. 
You're off-key, okay?

1623
01:31:26.333 --> 01:31:27.333
Action!

1624
01:31:30.250 --> 01:31:32.375
I think you just need to be
more polite, darling.


1625
01:31:33.333 --> 01:31:34.791
- Be polite.
- God!


1626
01:31:36.541 --> 01:31:37.541
Whoo!

1627
01:31:38.750 --> 01:31:41.291
Give me one more because I can't stop...

1628
01:31:41.375 --> 01:31:43.083
I can't stop laughing right now.

1629
01:31:43.166 --> 01:31:44.166
Oh!

1630
01:31:45.583 --> 01:31:46.416
Not funny.

1631
01:31:46.500 --> 01:31:49.333
We're gonna get so many partiers.

1632
01:31:56.083 --> 01:31:57.708
New Year's Eve... 
Christmas Eve.

1633
01:32:00.166 --> 01:32:02.333
- Do I have anything on my nose?
- Yeah.


1634
01:32:02.875 --> 01:32:04.708
Nothing's gonna get killed.

1635
01:32:06.791 --> 01:32:08.625
I don't know how that happened.

1636
01:32:08.708 --> 01:32:11.666
All you have to go is just go up there
and show your heart...


1637
01:32:11.750 --> 01:32:13.583
What? What am I doing?

1638
01:32:13.666 --> 01:32:14.666
Fine by me.

1639
01:32:17.666 --> 01:32:20.375
Would you please tell
that large, muscular man behind me


1640
01:32:20.458 --> 01:32:22.375
to quit stealing my close-up?

1641
01:32:24.666 --> 01:32:26.625
Excuse me, sir?

1642
01:32:30.666 --> 01:32:33.000
No, no, no, no.

1643
01:32:34.250 --> 01:32:35.291
And cut.
