1
00:00:14.707 --> 00:00:18.419
<i>Everything involved in an abortion</i>
<i>is sin</i> <i>and it's wrong.</i>


2
00:00:18.503 --> 00:00:19.796
<i>I actually believe it's evil.</i>

3
00:00:20.255 --> 00:00:22.632
<i>And so there's no value</i>
<i>in things that are evil.</i>


4
00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.599
<i>The child is ripped limb from limb</i>
<i>while it's still alive,</i>


5
00:00:32.142 --> 00:00:33.852
<i>while his heart is still beating.</i>

6
00:00:38.022 --> 00:00:39.107
<i>I'm a mother.</i>

7
00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.403
<i>I loved my pregnancies.</i>
<i>I love my children.</i>


8
00:00:43.653 --> 00:00:45.572
<i>I'm now a grandmother of four.</i>

9
00:00:49.325 --> 00:00:50.952
<i>When a woman becomes pregnant...</i>

10
00:00:53.538 --> 00:00:56.791
she loses a part of herself
to someone else.


11
00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.212
Most of us want that
because it's beautiful.


12
00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:04.549
It is not that way for everyone.

13
00:01:04.632 --> 00:01:07.635
We can sit here self-righteously
and decide


14
00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:11.598
that we always know best
for every person, but we do not.


15
00:01:12.515 --> 00:01:16.603
There's no reason to come back here,
session after session,


16
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.314
and make it more and more difficult

17
00:01:19.397 --> 00:01:22.567
and drive women back into the shadows
of illegal abortions,


18
00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.154
because it's exactly what this will do.
They will not stop having them.


19
00:01:27.363 --> 00:01:31.576
They've always had abortions. We've always
had abortions. Women always had abortions.


20
00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:34.954
And that will always be something
that will be sought.


21
00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.541
If you want to stop abortions,

22
00:01:38.833 --> 00:01:42.003
then help me stop unwanted pregnancies.

23
00:01:44.881 --> 00:01:47.342
Question occurs on the adoption of the amendment.
- -Representative Klick voting aye.


24
00:01:50.553 --> 00:01:52.430
Representative Oliverson voting aye.

25
00:01:53.598 --> 00:01:55.725
Have all members voted?

26
00:01:55.808 --> 00:01:58.895
There being 92 ayes and 42 nays,
the amendment is adopted.


27
00:02:02.148 --> 00:02:04.234
<i>A bill has moved forward</i>
<i>in the legislature,</i>


28
00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:06.569
<i>placing more restrictions on abortion…</i>

29
00:02:06.653 --> 00:02:08.821
<i>They're trying to get something in place…</i>

30
00:02:08.905 --> 00:02:10.990
<i>Texas will have new abortion regulations.</i>

31
00:02:11.074 --> 00:02:14.827
<i>...so that there's less</i>
<i>and less opportunity to have an abortion,</i>


32
00:02:15.328 --> 00:02:18.998
till, perhaps, there is no option at all.

33
00:02:19.415 --> 00:02:23.294
<i>I was a young woman prior to Roe v. Wade,</i>
<i>when abortion was illegal.</i>


34
00:02:23.378 --> 00:02:27.090
<i>I know the difficulties</i>
<i>of that period of time.</i>


35
00:02:28.132 --> 00:02:32.220
The idea that we would go back to that
was just unbearable to me.


36
00:02:33.012 --> 00:02:37.016
<i>The bill banned one of the most common</i>
<i>types of second-trimester abortions.</i>


37
00:02:37.725 --> 00:02:41.062
<i>This bill prohibits</i>
<i>one specific procedure.</i>


38
00:02:41.646 --> 00:02:44.107
<i>But we made it very clear</i>
<i>from the beginning</i>


39
00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.820
<i>that the legislative priority needs to be</i>
<i>something that will stop abortions.</i>


40
00:02:49.028 --> 00:02:50.989
<i>The legislative priority</i>
<i>needs to be something</i>


41
00:02:51.072 --> 00:02:54.826
that reveals the truth about abortion,
and the legislative priority


42
00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:58.079
needs to be something that will get us
closer to overturning Roe v. Wade.


43
00:02:59.455 --> 00:03:05.420
My goal is to make abortion at any stage
a thing of the past.


44
00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:10.925
<i>This bill</i>
<i>actually protects human life</i>


45
00:03:11.426 --> 00:03:14.262
<i>beyond 20 weeks here</i>
<i>in the Commonwealth of Kentucky.</i>


46
00:03:15.471 --> 00:03:18.766
<i>I am pro-life,</i>
<i>and I very strongly believe</i>


47
00:03:18.891 --> 00:03:21.144
<i>that we must promote life, defend life…</i>

48
00:03:21.227 --> 00:03:24.314
<i>My goal is to end abortion</i>
<i>in Mississippi.</i>


49
00:03:31.237 --> 00:03:35.491
<i>There is a steady chipping away</i>
<i>of the right to abortion in America.</i>


50
00:03:35.575 --> 00:03:39.370
<i>There are places in the country,</i>
<i>it's as if Roe versus Wade never happened.</i>


51
00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.832
<i>The Supreme Court today</i>
<i>legalized abortions.</i>


52
00:03:44.584 --> 00:03:49.005
<i>Since 2010, 300 abortion restrictions</i>
<i>have been passed in this country,</i>


53
00:03:49.088 --> 00:03:54.469
and I think many people are unaware
of how restricted abortion has become.


54
00:03:54.635 --> 00:03:56.929
<i>The Republican Party's</i>
<i>the party of life,</i>


55
00:03:57.013 --> 00:03:59.098
<i>'cause people want life,</i>
<i>they don't want death.</i>


56
00:04:00.141 --> 00:04:01.809
<i>We want to end abortion.</i>

57
00:04:01.893 --> 00:04:04.729
<i>If we're gonna do it through</i>
<i>continuous legislation,</i>


58
00:04:04.812 --> 00:04:08.024
then we're gonna go back again and again
and again, until we win.


59
00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:31.297
<i>I think the feeling was that</i>

60
00:04:31.381 --> 00:04:34.467
<i>with the climate as pretty tense</i>
<i>around the abortion issue in Missouri…</i>


61
00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.260
<i>Missouri used to have</i>
<i>several places</i>


62
00:04:36.344 --> 00:04:38.262
<i>where you could get an abortion,</i>

63
00:04:38.346 --> 00:04:40.556
<i>but over the last decade,</i>

64
00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.518
<i>more and more laws and regulations</i>
<i>have been passed…</i>


65
00:04:43.601 --> 00:04:45.978
<i>Planned Parenthood</i>
<i>confirmed the Columbia clinic</i>


66
00:04:46.062 --> 00:04:47.605
<i>has stopped performing abortions.</i>

67
00:04:47.688 --> 00:04:48.981
<i>...and because of that,</i>

68
00:04:49.065 --> 00:04:51.109
<i>it becomes harder</i>
<i>and harder to provide that care.</i>


69
00:04:51.192 --> 00:04:54.237
<i>Thursday was the last day women</i>
<i>could have an abortion at the clinic.</i>


70
00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.240
<i>And now there's just</i>
<i>one abortion clinic in Missouri.</i>


71
00:05:00.743 --> 00:05:02.620
She's the lady that does the abortions.

72
00:05:02.829 --> 00:05:04.914
<i>The Planned Parenthood</i>
<i>in Saint Louis.</i>


73
00:05:06.833 --> 00:05:08.334
God does love you.

74
00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.713
Please, think about what
you're doing today and not do that.


75
00:05:13.714 --> 00:05:16.300
These babies
don't want to die today, Colleen.


76
00:05:17.135 --> 00:05:18.469
<i>When I started out,</i>

77
00:05:18.886 --> 00:05:22.223
I thought abortion would just be
part of my practice; that, you know,


78
00:05:22.306 --> 00:05:24.892
just like people need hysterectomies,
people need abortions,


79
00:05:24.976 --> 00:05:27.186
and I will take care of my patients
who need those.


80
00:05:28.646 --> 00:05:33.151
<i>But I realize that in conservative states</i>
<i>it can be very hard to get an abortion.</i>


81
00:05:34.444 --> 00:05:38.072
<i>And so I became a physician</i>
<i>who really focuses on abortion care.</i>


82
00:05:39.866 --> 00:05:41.909
<i>I live in Saint Louis, but...</i> <i>three out of four weeks,</i>
<i>I'm traveling somewhere.</i>


83
00:05:46.164 --> 00:05:49.250
<i>And it might be Monday and Tuesday</i>
<i>in Oklahoma,</i>


84
00:05:49.834 --> 00:05:51.919
<i>Friday and Saturday back to St. Louis.</i>

85
00:05:52.628 --> 00:05:54.547
<i>Then the following Monday in Wichita,</i>

86
00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:58.885
<i>which is one of the four places</i>
<i>where I provide abortions.</i>


87
00:06:01.554 --> 00:06:03.598
<i>They kill people for a living here.</i>

88
00:06:03.681 --> 00:06:07.185
We cannot stand by and say, "Well,
we're just gonna let that happen,"


89
00:06:07.268 --> 00:06:09.187
or it's the woman's choice and so on.

90
00:06:10.563 --> 00:06:13.065
<i>I'm happy with what we're doing,</i>
<i>and I'm gonna continue doing it.</i>


91
00:06:13.149 --> 00:06:15.776
<i>And we're gonna win.</i>
<i>I'm a big-time Trump supporter,</i>


92
00:06:15.902 --> 00:06:17.528
<i>and we're gonna win this.</i>

93
00:06:17.612 --> 00:06:21.282
It's-- The time is coming. The truth
is coming out, that's what's happening.


94
00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:25.870
<i>Well, I've had</i>
<i>these people out here ask me</i>


95
00:06:26.621 --> 00:06:30.333
what my thoughts and opinions
of abortion itself is.


96
00:06:30.625 --> 00:06:35.254
And I give 'em the same answer.
"My opinion." I keep it that way.


97
00:06:35.755 --> 00:06:39.967
The main reason I'm here is that girl
that flies up there on that flagpole.


98
00:06:41.135 --> 00:06:43.763
What I have against these people
more than anything


99
00:06:43.846 --> 00:06:47.058
is that they keep trying to push
their religion up on someone else


100
00:06:47.141 --> 00:06:50.311
in a nation that's supposed to have
religious freedom.


101
00:06:52.146 --> 00:06:54.732
<i>You know, you can think</i>
<i>whatever you want about it.</i>


102
00:06:56.317 --> 00:06:57.735
<i>But, in America,</i>

103
00:06:58.528 --> 00:07:00.571
<i>one in four women will have an abortion</i>
<i>in their life.</i>


104
00:07:01.322 --> 00:07:04.700
<i>So, to me,</i>
<i>abortion is just basic health care.</i>


105
00:07:06.452 --> 00:07:08.579
We're gonna remove the pregnancy, okay?

106
00:07:09.205 --> 00:07:12.583
<i>And when I think about</i>
<i>how politicized this has become…</i>


107
00:07:15.169 --> 00:07:18.589
I wonder, you know,
well, how did this happen?


108
00:07:25.221 --> 00:07:27.348
<i>In all the soul-searching</i>
<i>I have done,</i>


109
00:07:27.431 --> 00:07:30.184
<i>I sincerely feel that
if they do it now…</i>

110
00:07:30.268 --> 00:07:33.354
<i>that they are only disengaging from me…</i>

111
00:07:33.437 --> 00:07:35.815
<i>a kind of mass of tissue.</i>

112
00:07:37.149 --> 00:07:40.111
<i>In the early 1960s,</i>
<i>abortion was illegal.</i>


113
00:07:40.611 --> 00:07:43.739
<i>And there was a woman</i>
<i>named Sherri Finkbine.</i>


114
00:07:44.448 --> 00:07:48.619
She was a children's television hostess
in Phoenix.


115
00:07:48.953 --> 00:07:49.787
Miss Sherri.

116
00:07:50.162 --> 00:07:52.957
Uh, she had four children,

117
00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:56.294
<i>and she was pregnant</i>
<i>with a much-wanted baby.</i>


118
00:07:56.877 --> 00:07:59.547
<i>But she had taken this drug</i>
<i>called thalidomide.</i>


119
00:08:02.633 --> 00:08:04.760
<i>And she went to her doctor and said,</i>
<i>"What about this?"</i>


120
00:08:05.428 --> 00:08:08.889
And he said, "I recommend
that you have an abortion."


121
00:08:09.849 --> 00:08:14.020
<i>He said, "I can arrange an abortion</i>
<i>for you in the hospital here."</i>


122
00:08:16.272 --> 00:08:19.275
<i>Hospitals did some what they called</i>
<i>"therapeutic abortions,"</i>


123
00:08:20.067 --> 00:08:21.736
<i>only to save the life of women.</i>

124
00:08:22.028 --> 00:08:26.198
But if the doctor wanted to help the woman
out, he would interpret that very broadly.


125
00:08:26.741 --> 00:08:28.993
<i>The woman might say,</i>
<i>"I'm gonna kill myself."</i>


126
00:08:29.327 --> 00:08:32.038
<i>Then he could say,
"Her life is at stake."</i>

127
00:08:32.455 --> 00:08:36.208
<i>If therapeutic abortion is done,</i>
<i>it's usually done on the basis</i>


128
00:08:36.292 --> 00:08:40.338
of the mental and emotional disturbance
to the patient.


129
00:08:40.713 --> 00:08:43.591
<i>Women had to go before</i>
<i>a committee of male doctors</i>


130
00:08:43.674 --> 00:08:44.759
<i>to ask for an abortion.</i>

131
00:08:45.926 --> 00:08:48.346
<i>And women were often treated</i>
<i>very badly. Like,</i>


132
00:08:48.929 --> 00:08:52.183
<i>"Well, we'll do the abortion for you,</i>
<i>but if you agree to be sterilized."</i>


133
00:08:52.266 --> 00:08:54.101
<i>It was a common procedure.</i>

134
00:08:54.185 --> 00:08:57.480
<i>"We don't want to clean up your mess."</i>
<i>They would say things like that.</i>


135
00:08:58.689 --> 00:09:00.941
<i>But if you were a wealthy white woman,</i>

136
00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:05.321
you could probably find a way
to get access to the procedure,


137
00:09:05.404 --> 00:09:07.573
and it would be called
a therapeutic abortion.


138
00:09:08.949 --> 00:09:13.162
<i>Sherri had an appointment</i>
<i>at the hospital for the abortion.</i>


139
00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:17.917
<i>And she felt that she had an obligation</i>
<i>to let this be known</i>


140
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.128
<i>so that other women in the same position</i>
<i>would have the same option.</i>


141
00:09:22.421 --> 00:09:23.589
<i>But once the...</i>

142
00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:27.176
<i>the word kind of got out</i>
<i>into the local newspaper,</i>


143
00:09:27.259 --> 00:09:30.137
you know, the hospital said,
"Oh, no, we can't give you an abortion."


144
00:09:31.555 --> 00:09:34.100
<i>She couldn't find a place for an abortion</i>
<i>any place in the country.</i>


145
00:09:34.183 --> 00:09:35.434
<i>She had to go to Sweden.</i>

146
00:09:37.103 --> 00:09:40.147
<i>I just want to do</i>
<i>what's right for myself and my family,</i>


147
00:09:40.231 --> 00:09:43.150
and I don't feel bitter towards people
who oppose this religiously.


148
00:09:43.901 --> 00:09:46.570
I think we're doing the right thing.
I'd like to really emphasize.


149
00:09:46.654 --> 00:09:48.781
We're not making a decision
for other people.


150
00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:52.702
This is right for our family
and in our particular case.


151
00:09:53.494 --> 00:09:56.122
This became a big story.
It was in <i>Life</i>magazine.


152
00:09:56.580 --> 00:10:00.543
I remember as a very young kid reading it
and thinking, "Hmm, what's this about?"


153
00:10:01.001 --> 00:10:03.212
<i>So, it focused people's attention.</i>

154
00:10:09.844 --> 00:10:14.640
<i>If you were pregnant and did not</i>
<i>want to be, in the '50s and '60s,</i>


155
00:10:15.224 --> 00:10:17.351
<i>you had very few options.</i>

156
00:10:18.853 --> 00:10:21.230
<i>So, if you didn't
want to have a child,</i>

157
00:10:21.689 --> 00:10:25.359
either you were lucky enough to have
a family doctor who would help you,


158
00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:29.989
or to have enough money to go
to Puerto Rico or some other country,


159
00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:32.867
<i>where you could get an abortion.</i>

160
00:10:34.618 --> 00:10:37.747
<i>After I graduated from college,</i>
<i>I was pregnant</i>


161
00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:41.959
<i>and I was in England.</i>
<i>I didn't know what to do and...</i>


162
00:10:42.626 --> 00:10:47.423
<i>was terrified. And I found a doctor</i>
<i>in the phone book in London.</i>


163
00:10:47.757 --> 00:10:50.718
<i>And he said, "Promise me two things.</i>

164
00:10:50.801 --> 00:10:53.971
<i>One, you will not tell anyone my name.</i>

165
00:10:54.555 --> 00:10:57.641
And two, you will do what you want
to do with your life."


166
00:10:58.726 --> 00:11:02.021
<i>And I'm grateful to him to this day.</i>

167
00:11:06.358 --> 00:11:08.694
<i>I didn't know anything about abortion</i>

168
00:11:08.778 --> 00:11:11.906
<i>until I became the chaplain</i>
<i>at Skidmore College in 1966.</i>


169
00:11:12.948 --> 00:11:16.368
<i>And I told my wife at one point,</i>
<i>I said, "You know, 1,400 young women.</i>


170
00:11:16.452 --> 00:11:18.204
What kind of problems could they have?"

171
00:11:18.454 --> 00:11:20.831
And she said, "You're a dope.
You're gonna find out."


172
00:11:21.916 --> 00:11:23.125
<i>Students who were pregnant,</i>

173
00:11:23.209 --> 00:11:25.377
<i>but didn't want to tell their families,</i>
<i>would come to me.</i>


174
00:11:26.378 --> 00:11:29.381
<i>And I'd send the student</i>
<i>to a doctor in Schenectady,</i>


175
00:11:29.507 --> 00:11:31.884
<i>who always found it necessary</i>
<i>to do an abortion.</i>


176
00:11:32.718 --> 00:11:35.262
<i>And that's how I learned</i>
<i>that I wasn't just a chaplain.</i>


177
00:11:35.346 --> 00:11:37.348
I learned I was an abortion counselor.

178
00:11:39.016 --> 00:11:42.728
<i>There were many other college chaplains</i>
<i>doing the same thing around the country.</i>


179
00:11:44.188 --> 00:11:47.733
<i>This is the Clergy Consultation</i>
<i>Service on problem pregnancy.</i>


180
00:11:47.817 --> 00:11:49.860
<i>The first public</i>
<i>organized group</i>


181
00:11:49.944 --> 00:11:51.612
<i>was the Clergy Consultation Service.</i>

182
00:11:51.946 --> 00:11:55.366
<i>This was 19 Protestant ministers</i>
<i>and two Jewish rabbis.</i>


183
00:11:55.449 --> 00:11:58.327
<i>Clergymen counseling this week</i>
<i>are Reverend...</i>


184
00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:00.120
<i>And I was a part of that.</i>

185
00:12:00.412 --> 00:12:04.375
<i>We would not ask them why they were having</i>
<i>the abortion. That was not our business.</i>


186
00:12:04.625 --> 00:12:08.212
But most of the women wanted to talk
about it. They wanted to tell me why.


187
00:12:08.838 --> 00:12:11.924
And so it was quite an education
for a young male minister


188
00:12:12.007 --> 00:12:13.384
into the lives of women.

189
00:12:15.636 --> 00:12:19.807
We went into this apartment,
and it was dark, dingy.


190
00:12:21.183 --> 00:12:25.521
He apologized. He said, "I'm sorry
you have to be treated like a criminal."


191
00:12:26.522 --> 00:12:31.026
<i>This 24-year-old girl had</i>
<i>an illegal abortion less than an hour ago.</i>


192
00:12:32.361 --> 00:12:37.199
<i>The laws which govern abortion are broken</i>
<i>an estimated one million times a year.</i>


193
00:12:38.701 --> 00:12:40.828
<i>Even though</i>
<i>they suffered great indignity,</i>


194
00:12:40.953 --> 00:12:46.041
<i>wealthy women often had a safe way</i>
<i>of ending an unintended pregnancy.</i>


195
00:12:47.167 --> 00:12:49.795
But during my clinical training
at Harlem Hospital,


196
00:12:49.879 --> 00:12:53.132
I really was thrust
into an environment


197
00:12:53.215 --> 00:12:57.303
<i>where women were from a very poor</i>
<i>and deprived background.</i>


198
00:12:58.512 --> 00:13:01.390
<i>And then I saw that African
-American women</i>

199
00:13:01.473 --> 00:13:05.978
<i>who were disproportionately poor</i>
<i>were the most directly hurt</i>


200
00:13:06.437 --> 00:13:09.356
<i>by the restrictive policies of the time.</i>

201
00:13:10.024 --> 00:13:13.402
<i>There were some pretty sad cases</i>
<i>of women attempting</i>


202
00:13:13.485 --> 00:13:16.071
<i>to terminate their pregnancies themselves.</i>

203
00:13:20.451 --> 00:13:22.119
<i>The facts are astonishing.</i>

204
00:13:22.202 --> 00:13:26.332
<i>350,000 women a year suffer complications.</i>

205
00:13:26.624 --> 00:13:29.001
<i>5,000 of these women die.</i>

206
00:13:29.793 --> 00:13:33.672
There were many terrified women
who were using coat hangers


207
00:13:34.006 --> 00:13:37.593
and knives and throwing themselves
down stairs.


208
00:13:39.428 --> 00:13:43.307
<i>And going to an illegal abortion doctor</i>
<i>was often unsafe.</i>


209
00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:46.602
<i>It was just a piece of hanger,</i>
<i>an ordinary hanger.</i>


210
00:13:47.478 --> 00:13:49.605
<i>Not a whole one. 
Just a piece.</i>

211
00:13:50.439 --> 00:13:53.359
<i>When you have an abortion,</i>
<i>you have to pay $700</i>


212
00:13:53.442 --> 00:13:55.402
<i>to go through</i>
<i>this cloak-and-dagger business</i>


213
00:13:55.527 --> 00:13:58.614
<i>to find you some guy who's willing</i>
<i>to stick a hanger up you.</i>


214
00:14:00.491 --> 00:14:02.993
<i>I heard that there was</i>
<i>a meeting.</i>


215
00:14:03.077 --> 00:14:05.120
<i>It was being held in a church</i>
<i>in the Village.</i>


216
00:14:06.872 --> 00:14:08.457
<i>What I'm talking about,</i>

217
00:14:08.999 --> 00:14:12.211
<i>more than likely, look at your neighbor.</i>
<i>She had an abortion.</i>


218
00:14:12.795 --> 00:14:16.382
<i>And, you know,</i>
<i>women just got up and told their stories.</i>


219
00:14:16.465 --> 00:14:18.425
<i>Those men offered me a deal:</i>

220
00:14:18.509 --> 00:14:21.053
<i>I couldn't have an abortion</i>
<i>if I wasn't sterilized...</i>


221
00:14:21.553 --> 00:14:25.599
<i>And I had never, ever in my life</i>
<i>heard women telling the truth</i>


222
00:14:25.975 --> 00:14:28.435
<i>about something</i>
<i>that only happened to women,</i>


223
00:14:28.852 --> 00:14:32.272
<i>and saying, "This doesn't have to be</i>
<i>this way. We have to change it."</i>


224
00:14:35.025 --> 00:14:38.237
<i>'Cause the laws are made</i>
<i>to keep that woman in her place.</i>


225
00:14:38.529 --> 00:14:40.406
<i>And suddenly, you know, that was</i>

226
00:14:40.489 --> 00:14:45.119
<i>a great "aha." You know, I thought,</i>
<i>"Okay, I had this experience.</i>


227
00:14:45.452 --> 00:14:48.414
<i>One in three American women</i>
<i>has had this experience.</i>


228
00:14:48.998 --> 00:14:52.543
Why, why is it illegal and dangerous?"

229
00:14:53.627 --> 00:14:58.298
<i>That was kind of the beginning</i>
<i>of the unraveling.</i>


230
00:14:59.133 --> 00:15:00.676
You got something to hide?

231
00:15:00.759 --> 00:15:04.638
I'm not sorry I did it and I would do it
again, and I think it should be legalized.


232
00:15:04.972 --> 00:15:07.016
<i>The issue is</i>
<i>reproductive freedom,</i>


233
00:15:07.558 --> 00:15:12.104
and that means the right to have children,
as well as the right not to have children.


234
00:15:12.521 --> 00:15:14.314
Something really profound is happening.

235
00:15:14.398 --> 00:15:16.567
Mainly that women
have caught onto the game.


236
00:15:16.650 --> 00:15:18.027
<i>We don't know it completely yet.</i>

237
00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:21.071
<i>You know, we haven't really discovered</i>
<i>the total anatomy of our oppression</i>


238
00:15:21.155 --> 00:15:24.408
and of what they've been doing to us.
But we do know that it's happening.


239
00:15:24.491 --> 00:15:25.576
We're on to it.

240
00:15:25.659 --> 00:15:26.994
Free choice!

241
00:15:27.077 --> 00:15:29.663
<i>This is going to be a battle,</i>
<i>and we will not give up</i>


242
00:15:30.497 --> 00:15:33.917
on the right of a woman
to achieve abortion.


243
00:15:34.376 --> 00:15:38.839
Early feminists... understood immediately

244
00:15:38.922 --> 00:15:42.301
that abortion was a central issue

245
00:15:42.384 --> 00:15:44.928
of feminism and to women's rights.

246
00:15:45.345 --> 00:15:47.473
-What do we want?
-Free choice!


247
00:15:47.556 --> 00:15:49.058
-When do you want it?
-Now!


248
00:15:49.141 --> 00:15:51.435
<i>If you didn't have control</i>
<i>over your own body,</i>


249
00:15:51.518 --> 00:15:53.228
<i>what kind of right could you ask for?</i>

250
00:15:53.979 --> 00:15:57.900
It is a political issue,
and the state means to control our bodies.


251
00:15:58.025 --> 00:16:00.277
We produce the soldiers,
we produce the workers,


252
00:16:00.444 --> 00:16:03.614
and they fear the loss of that control.

253
00:16:04.031 --> 00:16:06.200
<i>It's the basis of democracy</i>

254
00:16:06.742 --> 00:16:08.660
that you control your own body.

255
00:16:09.745 --> 00:16:14.166
And it's the basis of hierarchy
and totalitarian regimes that you don't.


256
00:16:14.833 --> 00:16:17.002
Safe legal abortions
are not available to our--


257
00:16:17.086 --> 00:16:19.254
All right. Will you please sit down
or be removed--


258
00:16:19.338 --> 00:16:21.090
No, we aren't gonna sit down.
Why don't you--


259
00:16:21.173 --> 00:16:23.842
A woman gets pregnant
and she's treated like a criminal.


260
00:16:23.926 --> 00:16:25.260
She can't get an abortion.

261
00:16:25.511 --> 00:16:29.098
She has to go through having that child,
whether she wants it or not.


262
00:16:30.808 --> 00:16:33.852
<i>Before the courts</i>
<i>got involved in the abortion issue,</i>


263
00:16:34.311 --> 00:16:38.232
it looked as if the matter
would be settled in politics.


264
00:16:40.234 --> 00:16:44.029
California passed a new liberalized
abortion law today.


265
00:16:45.489 --> 00:16:50.536
<i>California Governor Ronald Reagan</i>
<i>actually signed a reform bill.</i>


266
00:16:53.455 --> 00:16:55.916
<i>I think one thing that people</i>
<i>don't realize today</i>


267
00:16:55.999 --> 00:16:59.837
<i>is that it was the Republican Party</i>
<i>that was the pro-choice party.</i>


268
00:17:03.841 --> 00:17:08.637
<i>And there were states with Republican</i>
<i>governors who passed abortion reforms.</i>


269
00:17:09.721 --> 00:17:13.892
<i>And then New York totally repealed</i>
<i>the old 19th-century abortion law.</i>


270
00:17:13.976 --> 00:17:17.020
<i>…one of the nation's</i>
<i>most sweeping abortion control bills.</i>


271
00:17:17.646 --> 00:17:20.941
<i>The New York law said</i>
<i>you can have an abortion</i>


272
00:17:21.066 --> 00:17:24.611
<i>throughout the first two trimesters</i>
<i>just if you wanted.</i>


273
00:17:24.862 --> 00:17:27.531
<i>You don't have to give a reason</i>
<i>or anything. It's your choice.</i>


274
00:17:29.533 --> 00:17:32.494
And on July 1st, 1970,

275
00:17:32.578 --> 00:17:34.997
the first legal abortion clinic
in America


276
00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:36.999
was opened by the
clergy of New York City.

277
00:17:39.251 --> 00:17:43.046
<i>And that clinic did over</i>
<i>a hundred abortions a day</i>


278
00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:45.007
<i>for 13 months,</i>

279
00:17:45.799 --> 00:17:47.718
<i>until other clinics had formed.</i>

280
00:17:48.218 --> 00:17:50.470
<i>This is the first radical step.</i>

281
00:17:51.346 --> 00:17:53.432
<i>And that set off the Catholic Church.</i>

282
00:17:53.891 --> 00:17:56.476
I have set before you

283
00:17:57.144 --> 00:17:58.937
life and death.

284
00:18:00.439 --> 00:18:02.900
Therefore, choose life.

285
00:18:05.194 --> 00:18:07.946
The unborn
child has no choice.


286
00:18:08.572 --> 00:18:12.201
Does the Catholic Church give you
as much help as you need in this issue?


287
00:18:13.410 --> 00:18:15.954
<i>The Catholic Church</i>
<i>was very strategic</i>


288
00:18:16.038 --> 00:18:17.789
<i>in its opposition to abortion.</i>

289
00:18:17.873 --> 00:18:19.625
<i>They set up the Right to Life committee,</i>

290
00:18:19.791 --> 00:18:23.253
and the cardinal and the church
pushed back vigorously.


291
00:18:23.754 --> 00:18:25.839
<i>Legal abortion in New York</i>

292
00:18:25.923 --> 00:18:30.594
<i>has already claimed</i>
<i>almost a half million innocent lives.</i>


293
00:18:30.677 --> 00:18:34.014
<i>And the New York abortion law</i>
<i>came up in the legislature.</i>


294
00:18:34.139 --> 00:18:37.392
<i>…to abort a human fetus in the womb,</i>
<i>you oughta get sick to your stomach!</i>


295
00:18:38.101 --> 00:18:40.896
<i>There were a lot of</i>
<i>Catholic voters in New York,</i>


296
00:18:41.605 --> 00:18:44.816
and the church was saying,
"We're against abortion."


297
00:18:48.153 --> 00:18:51.281
<i>Ours is a nation</i>
<i>with a Judeo-Christian heritage.</i>


298
00:18:51.365 --> 00:18:54.076
<i>Republicans were in control</i>
<i>of the legislature.</i>


299
00:18:54.284 --> 00:18:57.246
<i>None of this justifies abortion.</i>

300
00:18:57.329 --> 00:19:00.415
<i>And now they were repealing</i>
<i>legalized abortion.</i>


301
00:19:00.958 --> 00:19:07.089
The Republicans I knew got angry about
taxes and how big the budget's gonna be.


302
00:19:07.172 --> 00:19:11.843
I think that the traditions
of the Republican Party are the traditions


303
00:19:11.927 --> 00:19:14.638
of an individual person to choose
what he wishes,


304
00:19:14.721 --> 00:19:17.140
as long as it doesn't infringe
upon other people.


305
00:19:17.724 --> 00:19:20.978
<i>We were the party</i>
<i>that believed in individual liberty.</i>


306
00:19:21.186 --> 00:19:22.229
Congratulations.

307
00:19:22.312 --> 00:19:24.898
<i>Governor Rockefeller</i>
<i>was pro-choice.</i>


308
00:19:24.982 --> 00:19:26.066
One more committee...

309
00:19:26.149 --> 00:19:27.985
And we felt, "Why should the state

310
00:19:28.068 --> 00:19:30.862
be telling women whether or not
they could have an abortion?"


311
00:19:31.697 --> 00:19:33.865
<i>Rockefeller vetoed the bill…</i>

312
00:19:38.078 --> 00:19:40.247
<i>and abortion stayed legal in New York.</i>

313
00:19:43.458 --> 00:19:46.503
There was a Gallup poll
in the summer of 1972


314
00:19:47.254 --> 00:19:49.673
that asked people to answer the question,

315
00:19:50.007 --> 00:19:54.094
"Do you believe that abortion should be
a matter between a woman and her doctor?"


316
00:19:55.012 --> 00:19:58.682
<i>Republicans by about two-thirds</i>
<i>said yes to that question,</i>


317
00:19:58.932 --> 00:20:02.394
<i>"Abortion should be a matter left</i>
<i>to a woman and her doctor."</i>


318
00:20:03.562 --> 00:20:04.646
<i>Not the government.</i>

319
00:20:19.202 --> 00:20:21.413
<i>I think I'm probably</i>
<i>the oldest provider</i>


320
00:20:21.496 --> 00:20:23.290
<i>of abortion services in the country.</i>

321
00:20:26.168 --> 00:20:28.920
<i>I did my first abortion in 1967.</i>

322
00:20:29.004 --> 00:20:30.505
<i>Illegal abortion.</i>

323
00:20:33.258 --> 00:20:37.220
<i>The Clergy Consultation called,</i>
<i>and they asked me,</i>


324
00:20:37.304 --> 00:20:41.516
<i>"Curtis, would you</i>
<i>consider doing abortions?"</i>


325
00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:44.353
Do you have any problems
you want to discuss with me?


326
00:20:44.436 --> 00:20:46.063
<i>So, that's where it started.</i>

327
00:20:47.689 --> 00:20:51.234
<i>And I thought I could go to prison,</i>
<i>I could lose my medical license.</i>


328
00:20:52.027 --> 00:20:55.947
<i>And I grew up religious.</i>
<i>I became an ordained minister</i>


329
00:20:56.031 --> 00:20:57.699
<i>my senior year in high school.</i>

330
00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:02.746
<i>And I think the basic Christian teaching</i>
<i>is compassion and service.</i>


331
00:21:03.372 --> 00:21:07.417
My head and my heart and my hands
said to do this. I can make a difference,


332
00:21:07.501 --> 00:21:09.961
and I'm going take the risk.

333
00:21:12.923 --> 00:21:15.092
<i>I've done this work ever since.</i>

334
00:21:16.802 --> 00:21:20.305
<i>I'm now 80 years old.</i>
<i>And after 80 years, I've decided</i>


335
00:21:20.931 --> 00:21:24.184
I'm not moving on to another career.
I think this is it.


336
00:21:24.267 --> 00:21:25.560
I mean, I'm still needed.

337
00:21:28.355 --> 00:21:30.565
<i>Thank you for calling</i>
<i>the Southwestern Women's Surgery Center.</i>


338
00:21:30.649 --> 00:21:31.942
I'm Alicia. How may I help you?

339
00:21:33.193 --> 00:21:36.696
Okay. I have availability
for tomorrow afternoon...


340
00:21:39.408 --> 00:21:42.536
<i>I've been urged by people</i>
<i>to pass on</i>


341
00:21:42.619 --> 00:21:44.913
<i>what I have learned and experienced.</i>

342
00:21:44.996 --> 00:21:49.000
<i>So, that's what I'm doing, trying to teach</i>
<i>as many young doctors as I can.</i>


343
00:21:49.084 --> 00:21:51.086
…dilate carefully…

344
00:21:51.169 --> 00:21:54.506
<i>My philosophy is that the goal</i>
<i>in providing abortions</i>


345
00:21:54.798 --> 00:21:59.010
<i>is to assist the woman in making</i>
<i>the best decision she can</i>


346
00:21:59.261 --> 00:22:00.679
for her and her life...

347
00:22:01.346 --> 00:22:02.931
in whatever that takes.

348
00:22:06.226 --> 00:22:09.980
<i>The most important moral question of</i>
<i>the abortion debate</i>


349
00:22:10.272 --> 00:22:12.399
<i>is what is in the womb?</i>

350
00:22:12.524 --> 00:22:16.945
<i>Is it a person? Does it deserve our</i>
<i>moral attention and protection or not?</i>


351
00:22:17.028 --> 00:22:18.447
<i>That is the most important question.</i>

352
00:22:18.530 --> 00:22:21.700
<i>In the pro-life movement,</i>
<i>we're outraged, because we believe</i>


353
00:22:21.783 --> 00:22:23.910
<i>that elective abortion is</i>

354
00:22:23.994 --> 00:22:25.871
the taking of an innocent human life.

355
00:22:25.954 --> 00:22:29.624
That is an act of injustice that
we can stop and we need to stop.


356
00:22:29.708 --> 00:22:32.210
-This is Doctor Boyd.
-Dr. Boyd.


357
00:22:32.294 --> 00:22:35.046
If you have questions,
we want you to let us know.


358
00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:38.091
And we'll take good care of you
and make this...


359
00:22:38.175 --> 00:22:40.552
Women continue a pregnancy
and have a baby,


360
00:22:40.635 --> 00:22:43.096
because they want a baby at that time.

361
00:22:44.222 --> 00:22:47.100
<i>And they have an abortion</i>
<i>because they don't want to be pregnant</i>


362
00:22:47.184 --> 00:22:49.769
<i>at that time in their life</i>
<i>for their own sufficient reasons.</i>


363
00:22:49.853 --> 00:22:51.730
The state of Texas requires

364
00:22:51.813 --> 00:22:56.067
that you be seen at least 24 hours
before your abortion.


365
00:22:56.151 --> 00:22:59.237
And then I'm gonna show you
this sonogram.


366
00:22:59.321 --> 00:23:01.948
That looks like
between five and six weeks, okay?


367
00:23:02.782 --> 00:23:06.578
Sonogram technology is one of the best
friends of the pro-life movement.


368
00:23:06.661 --> 00:23:11.374
It is changing a generation's mind about
what's going on in the womb of a woman.


369
00:23:12.042 --> 00:23:15.504
<i>It is very common for expecting mothers</i>
<i>to have sonograms</i>


370
00:23:15.587 --> 00:23:19.883
<i>on their fridge for children to know what</i>
<i>that picture is. That is their sibling.</i>


371
00:23:19.966 --> 00:23:23.762
<i>And so this was a great tool that we</i>
<i>wanted to tap into and to use,</i>


372
00:23:23.845 --> 00:23:27.599
<i>and we saw that abortion clinics</i>
<i>were already using sonogram technology</i>


373
00:23:27.682 --> 00:23:28.934
<i>before an abortion.</i>

374
00:23:29.893 --> 00:23:32.562
<i>Good morning, everybody.</i>
<i>John Seago with tech...</i>


375
00:23:32.646 --> 00:23:36.483
<i>We think very deliberately about what are</i>
<i>we doing that is taking a step forward</i>


376
00:23:36.566 --> 00:23:39.528
<i>to challenging the very foundations</i>
<i>of Roe v. Wade.</i>


377
00:23:39.611 --> 00:23:42.614
And the sonogram bill was an important one
because we were pushing how much


378
00:23:42.697 --> 00:23:45.033
<i>we can require a physician to do.</i>

379
00:23:45.116 --> 00:23:49.496
All right. So Chapter 171 of the Texas
Health and Safety Code require that


380
00:23:49.579 --> 00:23:53.208
I provide you with this information
at least 24 hours prior to your procedure.


381
00:23:53.291 --> 00:23:56.127
We wanted the sonogram
not just to be performed,


382
00:23:56.211 --> 00:23:58.922
for the sake of the abortionist,
but also to be displayed


383
00:23:59.005 --> 00:24:01.174
for the woman to see.
That was the whole goal.


384
00:24:01.258 --> 00:24:02.884
This little blurry thing right here.

385
00:24:02.968 --> 00:24:05.762
If you focus kind of right there
and you see a little flicker.


386
00:24:05.845 --> 00:24:08.223
-Yeah.
-That's the heartbeat. Cardiac activity.


387
00:24:08.431 --> 00:24:10.350
The law says
a doctor has to describe


388
00:24:10.433 --> 00:24:12.769
what she sees on the screen
to the patient,


389
00:24:12.852 --> 00:24:14.729
giving her a chance to change her mind,

390
00:24:14.813 --> 00:24:18.858
to see the error of her ways
and realize what she's about to do.


391
00:24:18.942 --> 00:24:20.527
That's the idea.

392
00:24:21.695 --> 00:24:25.156
<i>This is the state</i>
<i>imposing it upon the woman.</i>


393
00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:28.660
She has engaged a doctor
to discuss this with her


394
00:24:28.743 --> 00:24:31.580
and help her come to a resolution.

395
00:24:31.663 --> 00:24:34.124
She did not engage
the legislature of the state of Texas.


396
00:24:36.418 --> 00:24:38.920
<i>It is the strong conviction</i>
<i>of Texas Right to Life</i>


397
00:24:39.004 --> 00:24:42.132
<i>that the legislature should work</i>
<i>to stop abortions.</i>


398
00:24:42.966 --> 00:24:47.220
In the capitol, we have the capacity
to direct the conversation.


399
00:24:47.304 --> 00:24:52.767
<i>All elective abortion is a violent act</i>
<i>of injustice and should be rejected.</i>


400
00:24:52.851 --> 00:24:54.060
Hey.

401
00:24:54.144 --> 00:24:57.230
If you're running in Texas
as a Republican...


402
00:24:57.314 --> 00:25:00.775
An inhumane action
to a human child in the womb.


403
00:25:00.859 --> 00:25:04.404
...you have to claim to agree
with pro-life principles.


404
00:25:04.863 --> 00:25:08.158
<i>Sid Miller helped pass powerful</i>
<i>legislation to protect the unborn.</i>


405
00:25:08.241 --> 00:25:10.702
Thank you and God bless.

406
00:25:10.785 --> 00:25:13.330
You can be elected
as agriculture commissioner.


407
00:25:14.331 --> 00:25:18.960
You can be elected as the chief financial
officer of our state because of abortion.


408
00:25:19.044 --> 00:25:21.296
Not because of your skills with numbers.

409
00:25:21.379 --> 00:25:25.342
We must pass one of the strongest
pieces of pro-life legislation.


410
00:25:25.425 --> 00:25:26.635
<i>But because of your skill</i>

411
00:25:26.718 --> 00:25:30.472
<i>at getting legislation passed</i>
<i>to obstruct access to abortion.</i>


412
00:25:30.555 --> 00:25:33.350
That's how powerful
this issue is in Texas.


413
00:25:33.433 --> 00:25:37.646
That's how powerful pro-life
advocacy groups have become.


414
00:25:38.104 --> 00:25:43.485
I signed a sonogram law so mothers facing
that agonizing choice can actually see.


415
00:25:44.569 --> 00:25:45.779
And I know it...

416
00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:47.822
works.

417
00:25:53.828 --> 00:25:57.165
We want to see all unborn children
protected, and we believe that


418
00:25:57.248 --> 00:26:00.752
what we've been doing is still
the best way to approach it.


419
00:26:00.835 --> 00:26:04.005
<i>Yet another round in</i>
<i>the abortion battle has been fought on...</i>


420
00:26:04.089 --> 00:26:07.217
<i>But our roadblock</i>
<i>has always been the Supreme Court.</i>


421
00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:09.594
<i>The Court declined</i>
<i>to overrule Roe versus Wade.</i>


422
00:26:09.678 --> 00:26:12.764
<i>We're gonna keep plugging away</i>
<i>to overturn Roe v. Wade</i>


423
00:26:12.847 --> 00:26:16.017
because we believe this country
shouldn't be killing its babies.


424
00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:23.525
<i>Is it a legal question,</i>
<i>a constitutional question,</i>


425
00:26:23.608 --> 00:26:25.860
<i>a medical question,</i>
<i>a philosophical question,</i>


426
00:26:25.944 --> 00:26:28.488
<i>a religious question, or what is it?</i>

427
00:26:30.031 --> 00:26:32.992
<i>There had been other cases</i>
<i>around the country</i>

<i>trying to challenge local abortion laws.</i>

429
00:26:36.496 --> 00:26:41.376
<i>But our case was the first</i>
<i>to get to the US Supreme Court.</i>


430
00:26:42.836 --> 00:26:45.880
<i>The law in Texas was that abortion</i>
<i>was illegal,</i>


431
00:26:45.964 --> 00:26:50.176
<i>and we had a woman who was</i>
<i>already pregnant who didn't want to be...</i>


432
00:26:51.678 --> 00:26:53.346
<i>and she didn't want her name public.</i>

433
00:26:54.472 --> 00:26:57.600
<i>So, we thought,</i>
<i>"Well, John Doe, Jane Roe."</i>


434
00:26:58.143 --> 00:27:01.396
<i>And Henry Wade</i>
<i>was the district attorney in Dallas.</i>


435
00:27:02.856 --> 00:27:07.777
And it was clear that so many women
were affected by this issue.


436
00:27:10.238 --> 00:27:14.659
<i>There was a flight that left Dallas</i>
<i>every Thursday going to California,</i>


437
00:27:14.743 --> 00:27:18.121
<i>and there were usually ten</i>
<i>or a few more women on that flight</i>


438
00:27:18.204 --> 00:27:22.459
<i>going out to California for abortion.</i>
<i>People were going to Colorado.</i>


439
00:27:23.334 --> 00:27:25.670
<i>And a lot of people</i>
<i>were flying to New York.</i>


440
00:27:27.964 --> 00:27:31.843
<i>And there were thousands of women</i>
<i>who had had illegal abortion,</i>


441
00:27:31.968 --> 00:27:34.345
<i>who had done their own abortion.</i>

442
00:27:34.471 --> 00:27:37.348
<i>And so we filed a class action</i>

443
00:27:37.432 --> 00:27:42.562
to say that this is a case for all women
who are or might become pregnant


444
00:27:42.645 --> 00:27:45.523
and want the option of abortion.

445
00:27:46.024 --> 00:27:47.984
<i>I was 26.</i>

446
00:27:48.067 --> 00:27:52.697
<i>And I was the youngest person ever</i>
<i>to argue a case in the Supreme Court.</i>


447
00:27:53.406 --> 00:27:55.658
<i>We are not here to advocate abortion.</i>

448
00:27:55.742 --> 00:27:59.120
<i>We do not ask this court to rule</i>
<i>that abortion is good,</i>


449
00:27:59.204 --> 00:28:01.372
<i>or desirable in any particular situation.</i>

450
00:28:01.873 --> 00:28:06.169
<i>We are here to advocate for the right</i>
<i>of a woman to determine whether or not</i>


451
00:28:06.252 --> 00:28:08.671
<i>she would continue</i>
<i>or terminate a pregnancy.</i>


452
00:28:09.255 --> 00:28:14.177
<i>Roe against Wade was argued</i>
<i>to nine middle-aged-to-elderly men.</i>


453
00:28:15.053 --> 00:28:17.347
It was a conservative Court.

454
00:28:17.430 --> 00:28:21.643
It was a Court with four Nixon appointees.

455
00:28:21.726 --> 00:28:23.728
<i>Their presence is expected</i>
<i>to make the Court</i>


456
00:28:23.812 --> 00:28:26.773
<i>more conservative than at any time</i>
<i>in recent memory.</i>


457
00:28:26.856 --> 00:28:29.818
<i>But abortion was not</i>
<i>a partisan issue at that time.</i>


458
00:28:29.901 --> 00:28:32.654
<i>It was a medical problem,</i>
<i>it was a social problem.</i>


459
00:28:33.112 --> 00:28:34.739
<i>Basic constitutional question is</i>

460
00:28:34.823 --> 00:28:37.700
<i>whether or not an unborn fetus</i>
<i>is a person, isn't it?</i>


461
00:28:39.536 --> 00:28:41.538
<i>At one point</i>
<i>a justice had said to me,</i>


462
00:28:41.621 --> 00:28:44.290
<i>"When do you believe human life begins?"</i>

463
00:28:44.791 --> 00:28:46.709
<i>And I said, "Well, 
Your Honor,</i>

464
00:28:46.793 --> 00:28:50.171
<i>we did not try to say exactly</i>
<i>what moment that was."</i>


465
00:28:50.255 --> 00:28:53.341
<i>There is no one answer to that.</i>

466
00:28:53.466 --> 00:28:57.470
<i>Different religions</i>
<i>have different answers to that question,</i>


467
00:28:57.554 --> 00:29:00.515
<i>but there is no legal standard that said,</i>

468
00:29:00.598 --> 00:29:03.726
<i>"At this point the fetus becomes a human."</i>

469
00:29:03.810 --> 00:29:07.397
So, the question is,
who gets to make the decision?


470
00:29:07.730 --> 00:29:09.524
Is it the woman,

471
00:29:09.607 --> 00:29:11.526
or is it the government?

472
00:29:11.609 --> 00:29:15.363
And my position has always been
it's not the government.


473
00:29:15.989 --> 00:29:17.866
Good evening. In a landmark ruling,

474
00:29:17.949 --> 00:29:21.202
the Supreme Court today
legalized abortion.


475
00:29:21.286 --> 00:29:22.787
<i>The Court split seven to two</i>

476
00:29:22.871 --> 00:29:25.623
<i>with Justices Byron White</i>
<i>and William Rehnquist dissenting.</i>


477
00:29:25.874 --> 00:29:28.918
<i>The decision made abortion</i>
<i>largely a private matter</i>


478
00:29:29.002 --> 00:29:31.713
<i>and ordered the states</i>
<i>to make no laws forbidding it,</i> <i>except possibly during the final months.</i>


479
00:29:34.591 --> 00:29:38.011
When Roe went through,
it was a shock to everyone.


480
00:29:38.094 --> 00:29:41.097
To go so far over to the other side,

481
00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:44.392
to put everything in the woman's hand
and essentially dismantle the laws.


482
00:29:44.475 --> 00:29:47.437
Now, in any other state,
you couldn't pass laws against abortion,


483
00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:49.397
not forbidding it directly.

484
00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:50.773
It was a constitutional right.

485
00:29:52.317 --> 00:29:53.985
<i>The Roe decision held</i>

486
00:29:54.068 --> 00:29:56.863
<i>that women have the right</i>
<i>to terminate a pregnancy</i>


487
00:29:56.988 --> 00:29:58.781
<i>in the first two trimesters,</i>

488
00:29:59.324 --> 00:30:01.826
<i>and then it's only at the third trimester</i>

489
00:30:01.910 --> 00:30:04.746
<i>that the state has the right</i>
<i>to prohibit abortion</i>


490
00:30:04.829 --> 00:30:09.334
<i>except when necessary to preserve</i>
<i>a woman's life or health.</i>


491
00:30:11.336 --> 00:30:13.671
<i>When the Roe v. Wade decision</i>
<i>was handed down,</i>


492
00:30:14.505 --> 00:30:17.717
<i>Planned Parenthood had been devoted</i>
<i>to women's reproductive health</i>


493
00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:21.429
<i>and access to contraception.</i>

494
00:30:21.512 --> 00:30:24.307
<i>And the local chapters</i>
<i>had to ask themselves,</i>


495
00:30:24.682 --> 00:30:28.102
<i>"Are we gonna provide abortions</i>
<i>now that they are legal?"</i>


496
00:30:28.728 --> 00:30:31.564
It was really a moment of reflection

497
00:30:31.648 --> 00:30:33.942
that was very tough
for the organization.


498
00:30:34.025 --> 00:30:35.777
March 11th is...

499
00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:37.403
<i>When it first became legal,</i>

500
00:30:37.487 --> 00:30:40.323
<i>Planned Parenthood was not keen</i>
<i>on abortion.</i>


501
00:30:40.990 --> 00:30:43.284
<i>Various affiliates around the country,</i>

502
00:30:43.368 --> 00:30:47.205
a lot of them didn't want to do abortions.
They really didn't.


503
00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:48.873
The board would be divided.

504
00:30:48.957 --> 00:30:51.376
Half the people would want to,
the other half wouldn't.


505
00:30:51.459 --> 00:30:54.712
Now, after the doctor's
examined you and everything is all right,


506
00:30:54.796 --> 00:30:58.424
the first thing he's going to do
is use the speculum. This is the...


507
00:30:58.508 --> 00:31:02.470
<i>But one by one,</i>
<i>they swung over to the active side.</i>


508
00:31:03.721 --> 00:31:07.475
And when they did, the people who didn't
like abortion would resign from the board


509
00:31:07.558 --> 00:31:10.353
and other people would come on,
and it's committed now,


510
00:31:10.436 --> 00:31:14.190
<i>committed to this right,</i>
<i>given by the Roe v. Wade decision.</i> <i>No court opinion</i>
<i>can change the law of God.</i>


511
00:31:19.195 --> 00:31:22.490
Every legal possibility must be explored

512
00:31:22.573 --> 00:31:26.327
to challenge the opinion
of the United States Supreme Court.


513
00:31:27.286 --> 00:31:29.497
<i>Life begins at conception.</i>

514
00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:32.375
Protect the life of the unborn.

515
00:31:33.167 --> 00:31:37.588
So, as long as there was
no New York law or no Roe v. Wade,


516
00:31:38.589 --> 00:31:40.758
<i>the woman was really, you know, an outlaw.</i>

517
00:31:40.842 --> 00:31:44.971
<i>She was moving around, trying to get</i>
<i>some procedure that was against the law.</i>


518
00:31:45.054 --> 00:31:47.223
<i>And nobody really tried</i>
<i>to stop her very much.</i>


519
00:31:48.933 --> 00:31:50.518
<i>But when the Court said,</i>

520
00:31:50.601 --> 00:31:54.897
<i>"You have the right to make this decision.</i>
<i>You have the right to define your life.</i>


521
00:31:54.981 --> 00:31:56.482
Not religion."

522
00:31:57.025 --> 00:32:01.237
That was unacceptable.

523
00:32:04.365 --> 00:32:05.450
Get out!

524
00:32:05.616 --> 00:32:07.493
There won't be any murder here today.

525
00:32:07.910 --> 00:32:11.873
<i>So, the Catholics were already</i>
<i>involved with various pro-life things.</i>


526
00:32:13.124 --> 00:32:17.587
<i>But for Operation Rescue,</i>
<i>the genesis really was more evangelical.</i>


527
00:32:17.837 --> 00:32:21.340
We rejoice, Lord. Hallelujah.
Glory to God.


528
00:32:21.424 --> 00:32:24.594
The name comes from Proverbs 24:11.

529
00:32:25.386 --> 00:32:29.766
The Biblical verse that says,
"Rescue those unjustly sentenced to die."


530
00:32:29.849 --> 00:32:31.601
Someone else
can be hooked up to this pipe.


531
00:32:31.684 --> 00:32:35.354
There'll be no abortions in here today.
No abortions in here today.


532
00:32:35.438 --> 00:32:36.272
Amen.

533
00:32:36.355 --> 00:32:37.982
<i>And so our motto was,</i>

534
00:32:38.107 --> 00:32:42.945
"We're here to rescue the innocent child
sentenced to die today."


535
00:32:43.029 --> 00:32:45.364
People out into the street.
There's hundreds more...


536
00:32:45.448 --> 00:32:48.201
<i>It was a very immediate thing.</i>

537
00:32:48.284 --> 00:32:51.412
<i>Almost militaristic. Operation Rescue.</i>

538
00:32:51.496 --> 00:32:53.539
<i>We're here to rescue these babies.</i>

539
00:32:53.623 --> 00:32:55.166
<i>The judges, the politicians,</i>

540
00:32:55.249 --> 00:32:57.293
<i>they're getting the signal,</i>
<i>as is Planned Parenthood.</i>


541
00:32:57.710 --> 00:33:01.214
Legalized child killing's days
are numbered. We will win.


542
00:33:01.297 --> 00:33:03.508
<i>This is a phenomenon.</i>

543
00:33:05.635 --> 00:33:09.138
<i>It was really an outworking</i>
<i>of our Christian faith.</i>


544
00:33:15.353 --> 00:33:18.022
So, this is the epicenter
of Operation Rescue.


545
00:33:18.314 --> 00:33:20.191
This is a former abortion clinic.

546
00:33:20.274 --> 00:33:23.611
We actually took this place
that was an abortion mill.


547
00:33:23.694 --> 00:33:28.366
We closed it down, we remodeled it,
and now we've made it our headquarters.


548
00:33:28.449 --> 00:33:30.827
Before we closed the place down,

549
00:33:30.910 --> 00:33:34.038
the property line
is right down on this crack.


550
00:33:34.122 --> 00:33:35.790
And we would stand right here

551
00:33:35.873 --> 00:33:38.376
and minister to the women
that were going in this abortion clinic.


552
00:33:38.459 --> 00:33:41.337
If we stepped over the line,
we'd be arrested.


553
00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:43.673
Just like that, be arrested.

554
00:33:47.218 --> 00:33:49.679
<i>Operation Rescue</i>
<i>has targeted Wichita</i>


555
00:33:49.762 --> 00:33:51.472
<i>with virtually all of its resources,</i>

556
00:33:51.722 --> 00:33:55.810
<i>attempting to close</i>
<i>the city's three abortion clinics.</i>


557
00:33:57.854 --> 00:34:00.273
<i>Thousands of people</i>
<i>came to Wichita,</i>


558
00:34:00.356 --> 00:34:02.150
<i>and that's because of George Tiller.</i>

559
00:34:02.775 --> 00:34:05.444
<i>George Tiller's Women's</i>
<i>Health Care Services clinic</i>


560
00:34:05.528 --> 00:34:09.907
<i>is just one of three in the nation</i>
<i>which perform late-term abortions.</i>


561
00:34:09.991 --> 00:34:15.329
The issue is a moral imperative
from God Almighty


562
00:34:15.413 --> 00:34:18.040
to rescue those led to slaughter.

563
00:34:18.416 --> 00:34:20.793
<i>The pro-life movement here</i>
<i>looks bigger than ever.</i>


564
00:34:20.918 --> 00:34:25.339
<i>Federal marshals were escorting patients</i>
<i>through the protesters, into the clinic.</i>


565
00:34:28.217 --> 00:34:32.847
<i>Operation Rescue</i>
<i>had really caused a shutdown in that city.</i>


566
00:34:33.556 --> 00:34:38.477
And I received a message saying
that Phil Donahue wants you to do


567
00:34:38.644 --> 00:34:40.438
a show in Wichita,

568
00:34:40.521 --> 00:34:43.774
<i>and he wants to
do it with Randall Terry.</i>

569
00:34:43.858 --> 00:34:47.653
<i>And so, you know, to go to Wichita</i>
<i>in the midst of this,</i>


570
00:34:48.237 --> 00:34:50.656
we were kind of going
into the belly of the beast.


571
00:34:51.324 --> 00:34:53.784
Faye Wattleton, 
I'm saying this to you.

572
00:34:53.868 --> 00:34:56.370
You have betrayed your race.

573
00:34:57.038 --> 00:34:59.332
When you think-
- Absolutely.

574
00:34:59.498 --> 00:35:02.043
To say that abortion for black women

575
00:35:02.126 --> 00:35:04.503
is somehow a favor to them
to kill their offspring...


576
00:35:04.670 --> 00:35:08.132
<i>To be characterized</i>
<i>as being engaged in black genocide</i>


577
00:35:08.216 --> 00:35:11.302
<i>is just what it is.</i>
<i>It's incendiary rhetoric</i>


578
00:35:11.552 --> 00:35:14.263
<i>that was designed to inflame the debate.</i>

579
00:35:14.347 --> 00:35:17.308
-Let me finish, Faye.
-I do not need you


580
00:35:17.391 --> 00:35:20.478
to tell me what my choices are
about my life


581
00:35:20.561 --> 00:35:23.147
and my body
because I am a black person.


582
00:35:23.231 --> 00:35:25.524
Planned Parenthood does
a hundred thousand abortions a year.


583
00:35:25.608 --> 00:35:29.153
They've killed more children
than any organization in the country.


584
00:35:29.528 --> 00:35:33.741
<i>I think this really is</i>
<i>about women's status in society,</i>


585
00:35:33.824 --> 00:35:38.120
controlling women's behavior
and the limits of that behavior.


586
00:35:38.287 --> 00:35:40.706
Any contraceptive
that is an abortive agent,


587
00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:44.210
such as the IUD or the pill,
I believe should be banned.


588
00:35:44.293 --> 00:35:48.339
Mr. Terry has in fact revealed
the ultimate agenda


589
00:35:48.422 --> 00:35:51.842
-of Operation Rescue and all of its type.
-No.


590
00:35:54.637 --> 00:35:57.515
<i>The emotion</i>
<i>and the hot emotion is around abortion.</i>


591
00:35:57.598 --> 00:36:00.351
It's murder, Phil.
That's what we have laws for.


592
00:36:01.269 --> 00:36:05.690
<i>It raises a lot of conflict</i>
<i>around sexuality, and...</i>


593
00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:08.985
<i>without any question, it's formidable.</i>

594
00:36:09.068 --> 00:36:12.405
…must be decided by the woman
and her physician,


595
00:36:12.488 --> 00:36:16.575
and not by Randall Terry and other people
trying to make that decision.


596
00:36:17.535 --> 00:36:21.205
But the ultimate decider here
must remain women.


597
00:36:21.289 --> 00:36:23.374
And that's what we're really fighting for.

598
00:36:23.457 --> 00:36:25.084
If abortion is illegal,

599
00:36:25.167 --> 00:36:28.754
what happens to those who perform
the abortion? Mr. Terry?


600
00:36:28.838 --> 00:36:32.466
Let me say this. Dr. George Tiller's
gonna do hard time when this is all over.


601
00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:36.137
He is a mass murderer.
He is an enemy of humanity.


602
00:36:39.932 --> 00:36:42.351
<i>The abortion battle</i>
<i>has taken a violent turn.</i>


603
00:36:42.476 --> 00:36:45.980
It was just one round after another.
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.


604
00:36:46.063 --> 00:36:47.982
<i>Dr. George Tiller shot by a
protester.</i> <i>We take no blame for this.</i>

605
00:36:50.067 --> 00:36:52.528
The blame rests
with the child-killing industry.


606
00:36:52.611 --> 00:36:57.074
They're the ones that are killing children
and breeding such frustration in people.


607
00:36:57.158 --> 00:37:01.120
We didn't know where the gunshots was
coming from. Just shootin' and shootin'.


608
00:37:01.495 --> 00:37:03.789
<i>Two women were killed in Boston.</i>

609
00:37:04.623 --> 00:37:09.045
<i>A doctor was killed in Pensacola.</i>
<i>Then a doctor and an escort were killed.</i>


610
00:37:11.339 --> 00:37:13.924
<i>Two bombs rocked</i>
<i>an abortion clinic in Atlanta.</i>


611
00:37:14.008 --> 00:37:17.595
Every abortion clinic is a potential
target for those who would do this.


612
00:37:19.347 --> 00:37:23.392
And at that point, I think, there was
a gravity that came out of the movement.


613
00:37:24.393 --> 00:37:27.646
<i>We lost another doctor in '98.</i>

614
00:37:27.730 --> 00:37:31.442
<i>And we lost Dr. 
Tiller... in 2009.</i>

615
00:37:31.525 --> 00:37:35.279
<i>Dr. George Tiller was shot dead</i>
<i>at his church in Wichita, Kansas.</i>


616
00:37:35.363 --> 00:37:37.698
<i>A man shot him</i>
<i>in the Lutheran church,</i>


617
00:37:37.782 --> 00:37:39.200
<i>in cold blood.</i>

618
00:37:39.283 --> 00:37:42.244
<i>The suspect is in custody,</i>
<i>and right now the police...</i>


619
00:37:42.328 --> 00:37:44.663
<i>And you really</i>
<i>have to think about this,</i>


620
00:37:44.747 --> 00:37:46.415
<i>that you would do this kind of thing.</i>

621
00:37:47.708 --> 00:37:51.379
<i>That's really astonishing.</i>
<i>That's just astonishing.</i>


622
00:37:51.462 --> 00:37:54.215
<i>Did there come a point in time</i>
<i>where your faith,</i>


623
00:37:54.298 --> 00:37:56.175
<i>your religious beliefs changed?</i>

624
00:37:56.258 --> 00:37:57.927
Yes.

625
00:37:58.010 --> 00:38:01.722
I had been watching
<i>The 700 Club</i> regularly.


626
00:38:03.015 --> 00:38:06.519
'Cause that baby is made
in the image of God Almighty.


627
00:38:07.186 --> 00:38:10.773
<i>I was alone in my living room, and...</i>

628
00:38:11.232 --> 00:38:15.653
that day I kneeled down and I did
accept Christ as my savior at that time.


629
00:38:16.404 --> 00:38:19.281
<i>Religion can</i>
<i>make people crazy. It really can.</i>


630
00:38:20.908 --> 00:38:26.122
And it can be wonderful, but it can
also be just incredibly intolerant.


631
00:38:26.205 --> 00:38:27.998
All those people who shot

632
00:38:28.082 --> 00:38:32.086
these people at the clinics and so on,
they were all religious.


633
00:38:47.601 --> 00:38:50.187
<i>The tie that</i>
<i>this clinic has to Dr. Tiller</i>


634
00:38:50.271 --> 00:38:51.439
<i>is really important to me.</i>

635
00:38:52.648 --> 00:38:56.652
<i>You know, that even in the face</i>
<i>of assassinating one of our providers,</i>


636
00:38:56.735 --> 00:39:00.531
we were still gonna provide that care
because women still deserve that care.


637
00:39:04.243 --> 00:39:07.621
And we do a checkup for you,
make sure everything's okay.


638
00:39:07.705 --> 00:39:08.539
Right.

639
00:39:09.248 --> 00:39:11.500
<i>There's a lot of traumatic memory of</i>

640
00:39:11.584 --> 00:39:13.919
<i>things that have happened</i>
<i>in the abortion movement,</i>


641
00:39:14.003 --> 00:39:16.964
<i>of clinics being bombed,</i>
<i>providers being targeted.</i>


642
00:39:17.047 --> 00:39:20.217
<i>You are a killer,</i>
<i>condemning your own soul to hell.</i>


643
00:39:21.719 --> 00:39:24.722
<i>You know, the potential</i>
<i>that your family will be targeted.</i>


644
00:39:24.805 --> 00:39:28.267
Dr. Johnson
has been killing children in our city.


645
00:39:28.726 --> 00:39:32.646
<i>That people may show up</i>
<i>at your home or at your kids' school.</i>


646
00:39:33.606 --> 00:39:37.776
<i>And you layer all of this difficulty</i>
<i>of actually practicing medicine</i>


647
00:39:38.986 --> 00:39:43.157
<i>with the threat to safety</i>
<i>or harm to you or your family,</i>


648
00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:46.035
it becomes a really difficult choice
to make for many people.


649
00:39:48.370 --> 00:39:51.499
<i>And one of the strategies</i>
<i>of the antichoice movement</i>


650
00:39:51.582 --> 00:39:53.209
<i>is to shame people.</i>

651
00:39:53.292 --> 00:39:55.377
They kill your baby.
They won't let you...


652
00:39:55.461 --> 00:39:58.047
<i>People who provide abortions</i>
<i>and people who have abortions.</i>


653
00:39:58.255 --> 00:40:00.049
If you don't kill your baby!

654
00:40:00.591 --> 00:40:03.677
<i>If you think about controlling when and if</i>

655
00:40:04.094 --> 00:40:06.347
<i>and how many children somebody has,</i>

656
00:40:07.723 --> 00:40:11.352
<i>it's sort of the absolute</i>
<i>demonstration of patriarchy.</i>


657
00:40:13.062 --> 00:40:15.731
<i>Because controlling</i>
<i>people's fertility can affect</i>


658
00:40:16.106 --> 00:40:19.151
<i>what education they can get</i>
<i>and what career they can have</i>


659
00:40:19.401 --> 00:40:21.278
and sort of how far
they can go in life.

660
00:40:26.450 --> 00:40:28.077
<i>The weak link</i>

661
00:40:28.494 --> 00:40:30.955
<i>in the abortion chain</i>

662
00:40:31.163 --> 00:40:34.416
<i>is the person doing the actual abortions.</i>

663
00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:37.294
<i>And there's fewer and fewer abortionists</i>

664
00:40:37.753 --> 00:40:40.089
<i>that are doing them</i>
<i>here in the United States.</i>


665
00:40:40.172 --> 00:40:43.300
<i>And they're retiring</i>
<i>and they're moving on.</i>


666
00:40:43.801 --> 00:40:45.761
<i>And so we've been very effective</i>

667
00:40:45.928 --> 00:40:48.430
in targeting particular abortionists.

668
00:40:48.514 --> 00:40:50.891
If they don't have an abortionist,
the place closes down.


669
00:40:51.642 --> 00:40:55.229
And when abortion clinics close,
babies get saved.


670
00:40:55.771 --> 00:40:59.525
These are abortion clinics we've
closed down, put them out of business.


671
00:40:59.608 --> 00:41:03.279
This is in San Diego, Oceanside.
Lawrence, Kansas.


672
00:41:04.488 --> 00:41:06.365
I like to look at
it as a trophy wall.

673
00:41:06.782 --> 00:41:08.951
We have probably closed down hundreds

674
00:41:09.535 --> 00:41:13.122
of abortion clinics,
and it's the one thing I'm most proud of.


675
00:41:21.255 --> 00:41:25.217
<i>Right now, there are seven states</i>
<i>that have only one abortion provider,</i>


676
00:41:25.301 --> 00:41:27.928
<i>and those states have been under siege</i>

677
00:41:28.012 --> 00:41:30.723
<i>in terms of restrictions</i>
<i>on women's health care.</i>


678
00:41:33.058 --> 00:41:36.520
So, we are constantly monitoring
the patterns in the states


679
00:41:36.604 --> 00:41:40.858
in terms of legislation that restricts
women's access to abortion…


680
00:41:40.983 --> 00:41:44.820
We've seen a lot of state moves
to defund abortion providers.


681
00:41:44.903 --> 00:41:48.949
<i>...thinking about what we need to do</i>
<i>to block legislation from passing.</i>


682
00:41:49.074 --> 00:41:51.160
We got that law preliminarily enjoined.

683
00:41:51.243 --> 00:41:54.413
<i>And then if it does pass,</i>
<i>we consider bringing a court challenge.</i>


684
00:41:54.997 --> 00:41:57.333
So, for Kentucky TRAP...

685
00:41:57.416 --> 00:41:59.585
And Kentucky is a perfect example.

686
00:42:00.252 --> 00:42:03.172
We are going to do
the best that we can

687
00:42:03.255 --> 00:42:05.716
to usher in a new day for Kentucky.

688
00:42:07.509 --> 00:42:09.845
<i>Before Governor Bevin took office,</i>

689
00:42:10.346 --> 00:42:13.599
<i>there were three abortion providers</i>
<i>in Kentucky.</i>


690
00:42:13.682 --> 00:42:15.893
I'm unapologetically pro-life.

691
00:42:15.976 --> 00:42:21.398
And he sprung right into action
to pick off abortion clinics one by one.


692
00:42:21.815 --> 00:42:25.194
Governor Matt Bevin has ordered
a Louisville Planned Parenthood clinic


693
00:42:25.277 --> 00:42:27.279
to stop performing abortions immediately.

694
00:42:27.780 --> 00:42:31.950
For the second time, Bevin administration
has sued a clinic over abortion.


695
00:42:32.034 --> 00:42:33.827
And we gave them
an immediate cease and desist.


696
00:42:33.911 --> 00:42:36.413
We said that we would seek
an injunction if necessary.


697
00:42:36.497 --> 00:42:39.875
<i>The Republicans now have</i>
<i>control of both the House, the Senate...</i>


698
00:42:39.958 --> 00:42:43.295
We had three abortion clinics.
We are now down to one.


699
00:42:43.629 --> 00:42:46.757
<i>And now Governor Bevin</i>
<i>is trying to shut down</i>


700
00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:49.593
<i>the last remaining clinic,</i>
<i>EMW Women's Center.</i>


701
00:42:49.677 --> 00:42:53.013
<i>...Bevin administration's</i>
<i>new rules for abortion clinics.</i>


702
00:42:53.138 --> 00:42:56.058
<i>And at the ACLU, we think</i>
<i>what Governor Bevin is doing</i>


703
00:42:56.141 --> 00:42:57.685
<i>is blatantly unconstitutional.</i>

704
00:42:57.768 --> 00:43:00.104
<i>If a judge sides with</i>
<i>Governor Matt Bevin,</i>


705
00:43:00.187 --> 00:43:03.565
<i>Kentucky will become</i>
<i>the only state in the nation</i>


706
00:43:03.649 --> 00:43:05.192
<i>without an abortion clinic.</i>

707
00:43:05.275 --> 00:43:07.736
<i>The situation in Kentucky</i>
<i>really is unprecedented.</i>


708
00:43:07.820 --> 00:43:10.781
We have never seen a situation
where we have been on the cusp


709
00:43:10.864 --> 00:43:13.909
of a state that has no abortion provider.

710
00:43:14.159 --> 00:43:15.911
<i>It's incredibly dire for women.</i>

711
00:43:17.955 --> 00:43:21.667
Close this place down!
Governor Bevin, close this place down.


712
00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:25.796
<i>It's exciting to see</i>
<i>pro-life activity at</i>


713
00:43:25.879 --> 00:43:27.756
<i>the last abortion clinic in Kentucky,</i>

714
00:43:28.340 --> 00:43:30.759
<i>because I have been looking so forward</i>

715
00:43:30.843 --> 00:43:33.011
<i>to the moment when we have</i>
<i>an abortion-free state.</i>


716
00:43:33.554 --> 00:43:36.724
And let's see if we can't put
the final nail in the coffin


717
00:43:36.807 --> 00:43:38.308
<i>of the abortion clinic there.</i>

718
00:43:38.851 --> 00:43:43.897
We in the Commonwealth of Kentucky
respect the sanctity of human life...


719
00:43:43.981 --> 00:43:45.733
<i>And Governor Bevin's been fantastic.</i>

720
00:43:46.942 --> 00:43:50.446
<i>Republicans stand against abortion,</i>
<i>stand for the Ten Commandments,</i>


721
00:43:50.529 --> 00:43:53.240
<i>and they stand for marriage</i>
<i>between a man and a woman.</i>


722
00:43:53.866 --> 00:43:58.328
And the Republican Party has
kind of become the party of morality.


723
00:43:59.204 --> 00:44:02.458
<i>And there's a war</i>
<i>for the heart and soul of America.</i>


724
00:44:03.083 --> 00:44:07.588
This debate is about little babies
who haven't given their consent,


725
00:44:08.172 --> 00:44:10.841
<i>and it's about time we said</i>
<i>enough is enough.</i>


726
00:44:11.675 --> 00:44:13.886
<i>Nobody's saying</i>
<i>that Planned Parenthood can't be</i>


727
00:44:13.969 --> 00:44:16.096
the leading advocate
of abortion-on-demand in America,


728
00:44:16.180 --> 00:44:17.598
but why do I have to pay for it?

729
00:44:18.182 --> 00:44:21.435
<i>Washington needs to defund them,</i>
<i>send a clear message.</i>


730
00:44:21.977 --> 00:44:24.605
I come here today
to ask my fellow senators


731
00:44:24.897 --> 00:44:26.815
to vote to defund Planned Parenthood.

732
00:44:27.441 --> 00:44:29.943
<i>Because this language and</i>
<i>messaging</i>


733
00:44:30.027 --> 00:44:31.445
<i>around defunding Planned Parenthood</i>

734
00:44:31.528 --> 00:44:33.071
<i>has been so pervasive,</i>

735
00:44:33.155 --> 00:44:35.491
<i>I think the general population believes</i>

736
00:44:36.033 --> 00:44:38.285
that defunding Planned Parenthood means

737
00:44:38.911 --> 00:44:40.162
not paying for abortions.

738
00:44:40.829 --> 00:44:42.915
<i>But in fact, and by law,</i>

739
00:44:43.457 --> 00:44:46.335
no federal dollars go to pay for abortion.

740
00:44:46.418 --> 00:44:48.295
Two and a half million patients

741
00:44:48.378 --> 00:44:50.547
depend on Planned Parenthood
every single year


742
00:44:51.131 --> 00:44:52.466
for birth control,

743
00:44:52.758 --> 00:44:54.760
for testing and treatment
for sexually transmitted...


744
00:44:54.843 --> 00:44:57.763
<i>We don't want our tax dollars</i>
<i>going to that organization</i>


745
00:44:58.180 --> 00:45:00.682
<i>for any service that they provide.</i>

746
00:45:01.391 --> 00:45:04.394
<i>Planned Parenthood</i>
<i>is a mega abortion provider.</i> It's about a third of all abortions
performed in this country


747
00:45:07.648 --> 00:45:11.860
are done by that one organization.
We just see them as...


748
00:45:12.444 --> 00:45:14.738
um, as baby killers.

749
00:45:14.822 --> 00:45:18.283
Please join me in welcoming
the President of the United States,


750
00:45:18.408 --> 00:45:19.576
Barack Obama.

751
00:45:19.952 --> 00:45:21.453
<i>And when it comes to abortion,</i>

752
00:45:22.037 --> 00:45:26.416
<i>they pretty much get to control</i>
<i>the agenda in the Democratic Party.</i>


753
00:45:26.667 --> 00:45:30.128
Planned Parenthood is not going anywhere.
It's not going anywhere today,


754
00:45:30.462 --> 00:45:31.880
it's not going anywhere tomorrow.

755
00:45:33.215 --> 00:45:34.925
And it's a known fact.

756
00:45:35.384 --> 00:45:37.719
Republicans will pass
pro-life legislation.


757
00:45:37.803 --> 00:45:41.765
We voted to defund Planned Parenthood.

758
00:45:41.849 --> 00:45:44.685
<i>Republicans made huge gains,</i>
<i>not only in the House,</i>


759
00:45:44.768 --> 00:45:46.895
<i>but in governors' races</i>
<i>and state legislative campaigns.</i> <i>We now have Republican...</i>


760
00:45:49.648 --> 00:45:55.821
<i>majorities in state legislators</i>
<i>and I believe 33 Republican Governors.</i>


761
00:45:56.572 --> 00:45:58.907
<i>We've had a game plan for many years,</i>
<i>we're following it,</i>


762
00:45:58.991 --> 00:46:00.742
<i>and I think it's coming to fruition.</i>

763
00:46:01.743 --> 00:46:05.163
What's so important for us to stand up
for the cause of pro-life?


764
00:46:05.247 --> 00:46:08.959
I cancelled their vacations and I brought
them back for a pro-life special session.


765
00:46:09.042 --> 00:46:11.712
And I'm convinced
that we're going to get the job done.


766
00:46:13.797 --> 00:46:15.966
<i>The general assembly is</i>
<i>heavily Republican.</i>


767
00:46:16.049 --> 00:46:18.927
<i>They have a two-thirds majority in both</i>
<i>Chambers.</i>


768
00:46:23.223 --> 00:46:26.476
<i>I provide abortion care</i>
<i>in several clinics in the Midwest.</i>


769
00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:31.189
<i>and the clinics have to be able to comply</i>
<i>with the layers and layers and layers</i>


770
00:46:31.273 --> 00:46:33.275
<i>of regulations that have been put on them.</i>

771
00:46:33.358 --> 00:46:35.652
<i>Legislation is on its way to the House</i>

772
00:46:35.736 --> 00:46:38.196
<i>that would require inspections</i>
<i>of abortion clinics</i>


773
00:46:38.488 --> 00:46:40.908
<i>and enact other new restrictions</i>
<i>on the procedure.</i>


774
00:46:40.991 --> 00:46:43.952
<i>And now we're facing</i>
<i>more legislation, more regulations,</i>


775
00:46:44.536 --> 00:46:48.498
new bills being introduced,
new laws going into effect, and...


776
00:46:48.874 --> 00:46:53.045
on an almost day-to-day basis,
what we can do might change.


777
00:46:53.128 --> 00:46:55.589
<i>Missouri lawmakers have</i>
<i>enacted one of the nation's</i>


778
00:46:55.672 --> 00:46:57.090
<i>longest abortion waiting periods.</i>

779
00:46:57.174 --> 00:46:59.259
<i>Governor Greitens calls</i>
<i>a special session.</i>


780
00:46:59.343 --> 00:47:00.719
<i>State lawmakers are back--</i>

781
00:47:00.928 --> 00:47:03.096
<i>And there's so much</i>

782
00:47:03.180 --> 00:47:06.224
<i>factual inaccuracy in</i>
<i>these bills and in hearings,</i>


783
00:47:07.392 --> 00:47:10.187
<i>I felt that somebody really needs</i>
<i>to be a voice.</i>


784
00:47:10.771 --> 00:47:13.649
<i>A voice for medicine</i>
<i>and a voice for science.</i>


785
00:47:15.108 --> 00:47:18.528
Okay. Good afternoon.
I'm Dr. Colleen McNicholas. I'm an OB-GYN.


786
00:47:18.612 --> 00:47:19.780
I practice in St. Louis.

787
00:47:21.073 --> 00:47:23.158
There shouldn't be a pro-life
or pro-choice law.


788
00:47:23.241 --> 00:47:26.620
There should be a law in healthcare policy
that is important and science-based.


789
00:47:26.954 --> 00:47:30.832
<i>-But every single time I've testified...</i>
-Why is your opinion


790
00:47:31.500 --> 00:47:33.168
so much different than theirs?

791
00:47:33.251 --> 00:47:36.463
<i>...lobbyists from the anti-choice group</i>
<i>will also testify.</i>


792
00:47:36.546 --> 00:47:40.217
-Here's some written testimony--
-And they can say whatever they want.


793
00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:43.178
...case by case, to protect the health
and safety of women in Missouri.


794
00:47:44.054 --> 00:47:45.722
Is it Dr. Lee?

795
00:47:46.390 --> 00:47:47.349
No, Senator.

796
00:47:47.432 --> 00:47:49.559
So, you're not a physician.
Are you a pathologist?


797
00:47:49.643 --> 00:47:50.477
Not at all.

798
00:47:51.603 --> 00:47:52.771
Which is infuriating.

799
00:47:53.271 --> 00:47:57.609
Especially from sort of the standpoint
of science and evidence and...


800
00:47:58.360 --> 00:47:59.528
just facts.

801
00:47:59.820 --> 00:48:03.490
The abortion clinic in St. Louis
has not been complying with the law


802
00:48:03.573 --> 00:48:05.534
in terms of turning over
complication reports.


803
00:48:06.451 --> 00:48:09.621
Every year we have
dozens of pro-life bills introduced.


804
00:48:10.580 --> 00:48:14.126
Lawmakers who come to me and say,
"Sam, what can I do?"


805
00:48:14.292 --> 00:48:18.005
What type of bill can I introduce
to reduce abortions?"


806
00:48:19.089 --> 00:48:23.468
<i>It's a bit of a cat and mouse game</i>
<i>between the pro-life pro-choice side,</i>


807
00:48:23.927 --> 00:48:25.929
...is not turning in complication reports. <i>Once again a bill on</i>
<i>abortion regulations</i>


808
00:48:28.557 --> 00:48:29.891
<i>moved through the legislature.</i>

809
00:48:29.975 --> 00:48:31.768
They have to have a complication plan.

810
00:48:32.102 --> 00:48:33.562
This is how I feel.

811
00:48:34.438 --> 00:48:37.482
Okay? We're not
in the field of medicine here.


812
00:48:37.649 --> 00:48:41.194
When did the government start approving
complication plans?


813
00:48:41.486 --> 00:48:43.530
I thought the doctors
or the physicians would do that.


814
00:48:43.613 --> 00:48:46.241
Our complaint is that
that should be for all clinics.


815
00:48:46.324 --> 00:48:49.578
if abortion facilities have to comply
with certain things, then


816
00:48:49.661 --> 00:48:54.082
so too should other clinics that are
providing similar levels of care.


817
00:48:54.624 --> 00:48:56.626
Are you putting plans together
for anything else?


818
00:48:56.710 --> 00:48:58.420
I mean, you could eat too much pork!

819
00:48:58.503 --> 00:49:00.964
And have a gallstone
and you'd have to go through surgery.


820
00:49:01.048 --> 00:49:02.716
Why is it that we're just doing this

821
00:49:02.799 --> 00:49:05.761
when it comes to individuals
wanting to have an abortion?


822
00:49:06.470 --> 00:49:09.097
-Well, I mean it is--
-It sounds so ridiculous.


823
00:49:09.639 --> 00:49:12.893
<i>Abortion is different</i>
<i>than just any other medical procedure.</i>


824
00:49:13.351 --> 00:49:15.979
<i>I know that the Democrats</i>
<i>and Planned Parenthood</i>


825
00:49:16.063 --> 00:49:18.940
want to treat it that way. I know
they want to talk about in that way.


826
00:49:19.024 --> 00:49:21.109
But talk to your average person
on the street.


827
00:49:21.193 --> 00:49:24.279
And they're going to tell you
that abortion is not the same as having


828
00:49:24.446 --> 00:49:26.239
a colonoscopy or having your tooth pulled.

829
00:49:26.490 --> 00:49:28.700
It's something unique and different.

830
00:49:28.784 --> 00:49:30.869
There is no other medical procedure, none,

831
00:49:30.952 --> 00:49:34.456
not one, that is legislated
in the way that abortion is.


832
00:49:35.165 --> 00:49:36.500
Enough is enough.

833
00:49:36.750 --> 00:49:41.004
I'm ready to go down fighting,
because I'm tired of the Republican Party


834
00:49:41.296 --> 00:49:45.717
bullying women when it comes
to their right to choose.


835
00:49:46.760 --> 00:49:48.136
I'll tell you what.

836
00:49:48.220 --> 00:49:52.766
I am proud to be with so many people
standing for life here in Missouri.


837
00:49:59.022 --> 00:50:00.315
Message received. Thank you--

838
00:50:00.482 --> 00:50:02.526
<i>You know,</i>
<i>from the perspective of today,</i>


839
00:50:02.609 --> 00:50:06.780
<i>I think it's important to remember that</i>
<i>abortion was not always so partisan</i> <i>and it wasn't always a requirement</i>
<i>for the Republicans to be pro-life.</i>


840
00:50:15.038 --> 00:50:18.542
<i>In fact, it took years of cultivation...</i>

841
00:50:18.625 --> 00:50:21.044
<i>We're concerned that</i>
<i>a million babies are dying...</i>


842
00:50:21.128 --> 00:50:24.965
<i>...by very smart Republican strategists.</i>

843
00:50:25.048 --> 00:50:29.386
<i>It took years to bring about</i>
<i>that kind of party realignment,</i>


844
00:50:29.469 --> 00:50:32.973
<i>the placing of abortion</i>
<i>front-and-center as</i>


845
00:50:33.181 --> 00:50:35.934
<i>a social, cultural issue in our politics.</i>

846
00:50:36.017 --> 00:50:39.729
We're concerned about the moral problems,
the breakdown of the family.


847
00:50:40.063 --> 00:50:44.067
We've come to seek
the welfare of America's children.


848
00:50:44.151 --> 00:50:45.819
God bless you and have a great day.

849
00:50:47.237 --> 00:50:51.408
<i>And it was accomplished in</i>
<i>the 1980s, by this coalition</i>


850
00:50:51.992 --> 00:50:56.079
<i>of social and religious</i>
<i>and political conservatives.</i>


851
00:50:57.330 --> 00:50:59.791
<i>And it was done</i>
<i>with the rise of Ronald Reagan.</i>


852
00:51:02.836 --> 00:51:05.964
<i>The 1980 election is when abortion</i>

853
00:51:06.047 --> 00:51:10.594
<i>really becomes a political issue</i>
<i>and particularly a Republican issue.</i>


854
00:51:11.178 --> 00:51:13.597
<i>We have</i>
<i>a threefold primary responsibility.</i>


855
00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:16.558
<i>Number one, get people saved.</i>
<i>Number two, get them baptized.</i>


856
00:51:16.641 --> 00:51:18.268
<i>Number three,</i>
<i>get them registered to vote.</i>


857
00:51:20.353 --> 00:51:25.192
<i>Falwell saw evangelical Christians</i>
<i>as the basis for a political movement.</i>


858
00:51:26.109 --> 00:51:29.696
Falwell wanted to organize evangelical
voters, who up until that time


859
00:51:29.988 --> 00:51:31.698
had not been politically active.

860
00:51:31.948 --> 00:51:35.535
It's always seemed to me
we haven't improved by one iota


861
00:51:36.036 --> 00:51:37.329
on the Ten Commandments.

862
00:51:40.332 --> 00:51:43.627
<i>Falwell and the religious right</i>
<i>identifies</i>


863
00:51:43.793 --> 00:51:47.964
<i>Ronald Reagan as a candidate</i>
<i>who would push their agenda,</i>


864
00:51:48.048 --> 00:51:49.674
<i>their socially conservative agenda.</i>

865
00:51:50.508 --> 00:51:52.552
Religious America is awakening,

866
00:51:53.011 --> 00:51:56.097
perhaps just in time,
for our country's sake.


867
00:51:58.016 --> 00:52:01.061
<i>But what got evangelical leaders</i>
<i>interested in politics</i>


868
00:52:01.144 --> 00:52:03.396
<i>was this notion that the Bible</i>

869
00:52:03.605 --> 00:52:06.608
<i>mandated the separation of the races.</i>

870
00:52:07.359 --> 00:52:11.404
<i>And several so-called segregation</i>
<i>academies were applying</i>


871
00:52:11.488 --> 00:52:13.490
<i>for tax-exempt status.</i>

872
00:52:14.074 --> 00:52:18.411
<i>And the district court ruled</i>
<i>that any organization that engages</i>


873
00:52:18.495 --> 00:52:21.331
<i>in racial segregation, or discrimination,</i>

874
00:52:21.456 --> 00:52:23.625
cannot claim tax-exempt status.

875
00:52:24.834 --> 00:52:26.920
That was the catalyst

876
00:52:27.003 --> 00:52:29.798
<i>for the religious right</i>
<i>becoming politically active.</i>


877
00:52:29.881 --> 00:52:31.174
We have a fight going on...

878
00:52:31.591 --> 00:52:35.428
on the question of tax exemptions
for Christian schools.


879
00:52:36.012 --> 00:52:39.432
<i>Paul Weyrich</i>
<i>was one of the chief strategists of</i>


880
00:52:39.516 --> 00:52:40.850
<i>the New Right movement.</i>

881
00:52:40.934 --> 00:52:43.395
Questions involved
are religious liberty questions.


882
00:52:43.478 --> 00:52:48.525
It was a movement that said
we are going to win the presidency


883
00:52:48.942 --> 00:52:52.862
through bigotry, but we are not going
to come right out and say it.


884
00:52:52.988 --> 00:52:55.156
This coming election's gonna be
a big test for us...


885
00:52:55.782 --> 00:52:59.160
This election is to make America
great again.


886
00:52:59.869 --> 00:53:01.913
<i>I have told the Republicans</i>

887
00:53:01.997 --> 00:53:05.417
<i>that you are loyal to a certain set</i>
<i>of moral precepts</i>


888
00:53:05.542 --> 00:53:07.002
in which you deeply believe.

889
00:53:07.836 --> 00:53:10.922
<i>Weyrich recognized</i>
<i>the electoral potential</i>


890
00:53:11.298 --> 00:53:15.468
of evangelical voters,
but he needed a populist issue


891
00:53:15.885 --> 00:53:19.514
that would appeal more generally
to religious voters.


892
00:53:20.015 --> 00:53:21.808
<i>And he was savvy enough to recognize</i>

893
00:53:21.975 --> 00:53:25.353
<i>that overt racism probably wouldn't work</i>
<i>on a wide scale.</i>


894
00:53:30.358 --> 00:53:33.528
<i>The pro-family movement</i>
<i>and the American people do not want</i>


895
00:53:33.611 --> 00:53:38.450
the women's lib ideology forced
upon all the rest of us.


896
00:53:39.117 --> 00:53:42.037
<i>Phyllis Schlafly had been able</i>
<i>to mobilize</i>


897
00:53:42.120 --> 00:53:44.664
voters around moral issues.

898
00:53:44.748 --> 00:53:47.167
Well, I am certainly opposed to abortion,

899
00:53:47.250 --> 00:53:49.377
because I think it's killing
an unborn child.


900
00:53:51.171 --> 00:53:53.965
<i>And as the presidential election</i>
<i>begins to take shape...</i>


901
00:53:54.049 --> 00:53:56.176
<i>What are the key issues?</i>
<i>In our judgment,</i>


902
00:53:56.259 --> 00:53:57.427
the right to life,

903
00:53:57.969 --> 00:54:00.889
<i>protect the unborn. 
These are key issues.</i>

904
00:54:01.681 --> 00:54:03.433
<i>Weyrich says, in effect,</i>

905
00:54:03.641 --> 00:54:05.101
"We found our issue.

906
00:54:05.477 --> 00:54:09.272
Abortion is going to work for us
as a political issue."


907
00:54:09.606 --> 00:54:13.276
Millions of unborn defenseless babies...

908
00:54:13.443 --> 00:54:15.195
<i>When you are trying to</i>

909
00:54:15.612 --> 00:54:20.116
<i>change the dynamic</i>
<i>of the political system in the country,</i>


910
00:54:21.242 --> 00:54:24.287
<i>you have to do it</i>
<i>through emotional issues.</i>


911
00:54:25.205 --> 00:54:27.832
In our Washington studios
is Jerry Falwell.


912
00:54:27.916 --> 00:54:31.920
America has violated the principle
of the dignity of life since 1973.


913
00:54:32.087 --> 00:54:34.756
And we're very strongly pro-life.
Our first order of business--


914
00:54:34.839 --> 00:54:38.510
And what is more emotional
than motherhood and babies?


915
00:54:40.428 --> 00:54:44.891
At that point the Reagan campaign begins
to embrace abortion as a political issue.


916
00:54:44.974 --> 00:54:45.975
I believe that...

917
00:54:46.476 --> 00:54:50.146
that when you interrupt the pregnancy,
you are taking a human life.


918
00:54:50.730 --> 00:54:53.608
<i>Which they ride through</i>
<i>the 1980 election.</i>


919
00:54:54.818 --> 00:54:57.654
<i>It's interesting.</i>
<i>One of the nation's leading pollsters</i>


920
00:54:57.737 --> 00:55:00.365
<i>says Reagan is winning the votes</i>
<i>of the white electors,</i>


921
00:55:00.448 --> 00:55:03.535
<i>who are followers</i>
<i>of the evangelical preachers,</i>


922
00:55:03.618 --> 00:55:06.621
<i>the so-called Moral Majority,</i>
<i>who have been active in the election.</i>


923
00:55:06.830 --> 00:55:10.917
This group is providing Reagan
with his clear margin


924
00:55:11.209 --> 00:55:13.211
in the election.
<i>Ronald Reagan's overwhelming victory...</i>


925
00:55:19.175 --> 00:55:22.887
<i>Reagan won 44 states,</i>
<i>with 479 electoral votes.</i>


926
00:55:24.722 --> 00:55:28.810
<i>They set out to change</i>
<i>the dynamic in the Republican party.</i>


927
00:55:29.060 --> 00:55:33.773
So they nominated somebody
that would be useful. And they succeeded.


928
00:55:38.236 --> 00:55:40.989
It was<i>now eight years</i>
<i>after Roe versus Wade.</i>


929
00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:44.951
<i>And it seemed</i>
<i>like the future of ending abortion</i>


930
00:55:45.118 --> 00:55:46.911
<i>was going to be in the Republican party.</i>

931
00:55:46.995 --> 00:55:49.497
And Reagan really gave a lot of hope
to the pro-life community.


932
00:55:50.540 --> 00:55:54.002
Can a person be a Christian
and support federal funding of abortion?


933
00:55:54.586 --> 00:55:57.464
I believe in an abortion
you are taking a human life.


934
00:55:58.256 --> 00:56:01.759
If you believe that, it very definitely
has a religious connotation.


935
00:56:02.927 --> 00:56:05.472
He just reaffirmed his support of

936
00:56:05.555 --> 00:56:08.183
everything the pro-life
movement represents.


937
00:56:08.725 --> 00:56:11.269
There's never been any question
that he was with us.


938
00:56:11.352 --> 00:56:13.438
We love life! We want life!

939
00:56:13.521 --> 00:56:16.024
<i>In the mind of the pro-life</i>
<i>community, the right to abortion</i>


940
00:56:16.191 --> 00:56:17.984
<i>was an aberration in the law.</i>

941
00:56:18.526 --> 00:56:20.403
So, with the election of President Reagan,

942
00:56:21.362 --> 00:56:24.699
we thought the next step would be
to try to reverse Roe versus Wade.


943
00:56:25.158 --> 00:56:28.161
We want life!

944
00:56:32.957 --> 00:56:36.002
<i>It is the Supreme Court</i>
<i>that has abolished prayer</i>


945
00:56:36.085 --> 00:56:38.671
<i>and the Ten Commandments</i>
<i>from the public schools.</i>


946
00:56:41.382 --> 00:56:43.510
<i>It is Supreme Court decisions</i>

947
00:56:43.593 --> 00:56:47.972
<i>that have brought upon us forced busing</i>
<i>and put our children on buses</i>


948
00:56:48.056 --> 00:56:50.892
<i>and send them across town to some school</i>

949
00:56:50.975 --> 00:56:53.228
<i>that their parents don't want them</i>
<i>to go to.</i>


950
00:56:53.811 --> 00:56:55.522
<i>It is Supreme Court decisions</i>

951
00:56:56.022 --> 00:56:58.024
<i>that have unleashed the pornography</i>

952
00:56:58.107 --> 00:57:01.277
<i>that has invaded our newsstands</i>
<i>and our television.</i>


953
00:57:01.694 --> 00:57:03.530
<i>It is Supreme Court decisions</i>

954
00:57:03.613 --> 00:57:07.909
<i>that have abolished capital punishment</i>
<i>and deterrents against crime.</i>


955
00:57:08.952 --> 00:57:12.121
And, of course,
it is the Supreme Court decision


956
00:57:12.455 --> 00:57:16.042
that has brought about
this tragic evil of our time.


957
00:57:16.125 --> 00:57:19.629
A Supreme Court decision, in 1973,

958
00:57:19.796 --> 00:57:24.926
that invented this new right of a woman
to kill her unborn baby.


959
00:57:27.136 --> 00:57:29.264
<i>If abortion is</i>
<i>a constitutional right,</i>


960
00:57:29.514 --> 00:57:32.392
<i>the most important thing was</i>
<i>to overturn Roe versus Wade.</i>


961
00:57:32.600 --> 00:57:35.770
In order to do that, you had to change
the justices on the Court.


962
00:57:35.895 --> 00:57:36.980
There's no other way.

963
00:57:37.855 --> 00:57:42.235
You need, as quickly as possible,
a reconstituting of the Supreme Court.


964
00:57:42.860 --> 00:57:45.905
<i>We just didn't think that the current</i>
<i>justices would have changed their minds.</i>


965
00:57:46.239 --> 00:57:47.699
<i>I will send to the Senate</i>

966
00:57:47.782 --> 00:57:51.119
the nomination
of Judge Sandra Day O'Connor, of Arizona.


967
00:57:51.744 --> 00:57:53.871
<i>The first woman on</i>
<i>the Supreme Court,</i>


968
00:57:53.955 --> 00:57:55.206
<i>Judge Sandra Day O'Connor.</i>

969
00:57:56.124 --> 00:57:59.877
She told the Senate today
that she is firmly opposed to abortion.


970
00:57:59.961 --> 00:58:03.256
In the area of abortion is
that I am opposed to it


971
00:58:03.339 --> 00:58:06.342
as a matter of birth control.

972
00:58:06.884 --> 00:58:08.886
<i>So, President Reagan</i>
<i>appointed O'Connor,</i>


973
00:58:08.970 --> 00:58:12.432
<i>then appointed Justice Scalia</i>
<i>and Justice Kennedy.</i>


974
00:58:12.557 --> 00:58:16.394
<i>And in the pro-life community there was</i>
<i>the hope that Roe versus Wade</i>


975
00:58:16.853 --> 00:58:17.937
<i>may get overturned.</i>

976
00:58:18.021 --> 00:58:21.441
<i>And we thought the Court was moving</i>
<i>much closer in that direction.</i>


977
00:58:21.733 --> 00:58:23.276
<i>Are you getting the feeling</i>

978
00:58:23.359 --> 00:58:27.363
that some sort of movement is under way
that would ultimately erode Roe v. Wade?


979
00:58:28.031 --> 00:58:30.491
I'm not only getting a feeling.
I'm part of it.


980
00:58:31.242 --> 00:58:33.703
- It's happened?
- It's happening.


981
00:58:33.995 --> 00:58:37.790
<i>The Americans United for Life</i>
<i>is one of the main players in this.</i>


982
00:58:39.167 --> 00:58:43.504
<i>They have a strategy of one anti-abortion</i>
<i>restriction at a time</i>


983
00:58:43.588 --> 00:58:47.425
<i>which could pass state legislatures</i>
<i>and maybe get up to the Supreme Court</i>


984
00:58:47.550 --> 00:58:49.135
<i>and overturn Roe against Wade.</i>

985
00:58:50.345 --> 00:58:52.430
<i>And it looked</i>
<i>like it actually might happen</i>


986
00:58:52.513 --> 00:58:54.932
<i>in an abortion case in 1989.</i>

987
00:58:55.391 --> 00:58:59.979
<i>But Justice O'Connor surprised the world</i>
<i>by sustaining Roe against Wade.</i>


988
00:59:00.605 --> 00:59:02.482
And that was a matter of

989
00:59:02.565 --> 00:59:06.069
extreme frustration
to the Court's conservatives.


990
00:59:07.070 --> 00:59:09.697
<i>I think Justice O'Connor</i>
<i>didn't want to be</i>


991
00:59:09.822 --> 00:59:11.699
the first and lone woman on the Court

992
00:59:11.824 --> 00:59:14.494
taking away
a settled constitutional right.


993
00:59:14.786 --> 00:59:16.954
And so she upheld Roe versus Wade.

994
00:59:18.247 --> 00:59:21.959
<i>But Justice Blackmun made</i>
<i>a very, very important statement,</i> <i>and he read it from the bench and he said,</i>
<i>"Roe versus Wade is hanging by a thread.</i>


995
00:59:26.255 --> 00:59:28.633
We are in a very tenuous circumstance.

996
00:59:28.716 --> 00:59:31.844
We're only one vote away.
The next case could do it."


997
00:59:32.053 --> 00:59:35.890
And after that,
the political situation really changed.


998
00:59:36.516 --> 00:59:40.561
Like a thousand points of light
in a broad and peaceful sky.


999
00:59:40.645 --> 00:59:43.773
<i>When H.W. became president,</i>

1000
00:59:43.940 --> 00:59:47.860
we thought that he would be
a pro-choice president.


1001
00:59:49.987 --> 00:59:53.408
Abortion divides. We have room
in our party for people that feel


1002
00:59:53.658 --> 00:59:56.619
one way, pro-life, or pro-choice.

1003
00:59:56.703 --> 00:59:58.705
This is an issue that divides.

1004
00:59:59.831 --> 01:00:01.332
<i>When he was a congressman,</i>

1005
01:00:01.457 --> 01:00:06.212
<i>he had been known as a big supporter</i>
<i>of family planning, to the point that</i>


1006
01:00:06.671 --> 01:00:08.840
some of his colleagues
called him "Rubbers."


1007
01:00:09.340 --> 01:00:11.968
Do you favor a constitutional
amendment against abortion?


1008
01:00:12.343 --> 01:00:13.970
I oppose such an amendment.

1009
01:00:14.220 --> 01:00:16.931
<i>The 35th Republican National Convention.</i>

1010
01:00:17.014 --> 01:00:18.808
What's the big challenge here this week?

1011
01:00:18.891 --> 01:00:21.644
I really don't know. I-
- Abortion, mostly.

1012
01:00:22.437 --> 01:00:25.440
People really need to understand
that the pro-lifers


1013
01:00:25.523 --> 01:00:28.860
are now the backbone that is holding up
George Bush.


1014
01:00:29.068 --> 01:00:32.613
George Bush has to take
a strong pro-family position.


1015
01:00:32.780 --> 01:00:36.117
And frankly, that means
a strong position on abortion.


1016
01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:41.122
And Bush turned against choice,

1017
01:00:41.414 --> 01:00:46.169
and he took on a position
that was stronger than...


1018
01:00:47.545 --> 01:00:49.130
than anything Reagan ever did.

1019
01:00:50.006 --> 01:00:52.175
I believe that abortion is wrong.

1020
01:00:52.759 --> 01:00:56.637
I believe that we should work
to overturn Roe vs. Wade.


1021
01:00:57.180 --> 01:01:00.808
<i>And I believe that states should have</i>
<i>the right to prohibit abortions.</i>


1022
01:01:01.726 --> 01:01:04.061
<i>I don't make many guarantees,</i>
<i>but I'll make you one.</i>


1023
01:01:04.812 --> 01:01:06.773
Pennsylvania will be
the first state in the Union


1024
01:01:06.856 --> 01:01:09.609
to end the nightmare once and for all
and to outlaw abortion.


1025
01:01:09.734 --> 01:01:13.654
Supreme Court case number 91-744.

1026
01:01:13.780 --> 01:01:17.074
Planned Parenthood
of Southeast Pennsylvania versus Casey.


1027
01:01:17.533 --> 01:01:19.160
<i>Planned Parenthood versus Casey.</i>

1028
01:01:19.327 --> 01:01:22.205
<i>That went up to the Supreme Court</i>
<i>in 1992.</i>


1029
01:01:22.288 --> 01:01:25.374
...one of the most
restrictive abortion laws in the nation.


1030
01:01:25.458 --> 01:01:28.252
And a lot of pro-life people thought
this was going to be the case


1031
01:01:28.336 --> 01:01:29.837
that would overturn Roe versus Wade.

1032
01:01:31.047 --> 01:01:33.591
<i>The Bush administration asked</i>
<i>the Supreme Court</i>


1033
01:01:33.925 --> 01:01:37.762
<i>to support further limitations</i>
<i>on a woman's right to have an abortion.</i>


1034
01:01:37.887 --> 01:01:40.473
<i>President Bush</i>
<i>has done all he can do</i>


1035
01:01:41.057 --> 01:01:44.727
to ensure that my arguments
are likely to fall on deaf ears.


1036
01:01:45.019 --> 01:01:48.523
<i>I was totally convinced</i>
<i>that we were going to lose.</i>


1037
01:01:49.106 --> 01:01:50.483
For he has packed the Court

1038
01:01:50.942 --> 01:01:55.571
with justices who are hostile to a woman's
fundamental right to choose abortion.


1039
01:01:55.655 --> 01:01:58.324
Abortion litigation is a lot
like <i>Sesame Street.</i>


1040
01:01:58.491 --> 01:01:59.659
You got to learn to count.

1041
01:02:00.243 --> 01:02:02.370
<i>And the only number</i>
<i>that's important is five.</i>


1042
01:02:02.453 --> 01:02:04.288
<i>Are there five votes on the Supreme Court?</i>

1043
01:02:04.789 --> 01:02:06.582
Five votes that would overturn Roe.

1044
01:02:07.792 --> 01:02:10.211
He is the best person for this position.

1045
01:02:11.003 --> 01:02:14.090
<i>The president nominated Clarence Thomas</i>
<i>to the Supreme Court.</i>


1046
01:02:14.423 --> 01:02:17.885
<i>And I thought he would be the fifth vote</i>
<i>to overrule Roe.</i>


1047
01:02:21.430 --> 01:02:26.602
<i>And I remember there was a silence</i>
<i>in the courtroom that was palpable.</i>


1048
01:02:28.187 --> 01:02:29.272
<i>Ms. Kolbert.</i>

1049
01:02:29.355 --> 01:02:31.607
<i>Mr. Chief Justice,</i>
<i>and may it please the Court.</i>


1050
01:02:32.316 --> 01:02:36.362
<i>Whether our Constitution endows</i>
<i>government with the power to force a woman</i>


1051
01:02:36.445 --> 01:02:39.365
<i>to continue or to end a pregnancy</i>
<i>against her will</i>


1052
01:02:39.782 --> 01:02:41.784
<i>is the central question in this case.</i>

1053
01:02:42.827 --> 01:02:46.747
And then the Solicitor General
of the United States stood up and argued


1054
01:02:47.081 --> 01:02:49.542
that Roe versus Wade
ought to be overturned.


1055
01:02:50.209 --> 01:02:53.504
<i>...the State does have</i>
<i>a compelling interest</i>


1056
01:02:53.796 --> 01:02:59.343
<i>in the potential life, in fetal life, and</i>
<i>that</i> <i>interest runs throughout pregnancy.</i>


1057
01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:03.055
But I wanted the Court
to understand the implications


1058
01:03:03.347 --> 01:03:07.685
of changing a standard
that was very protective for women.


1059
01:03:08.269 --> 01:03:11.314
<i>This Court has recognized</i>
<i>that the rights of autonomy,</i>


1060
01:03:11.522 --> 01:03:16.569
<i>bodily integrity, and equality are central</i>
<i>to our notions of ordered liberty.</i>


1061
01:03:17.361 --> 01:03:19.739
<i>Roe lies at the heart of those interests.</i>

1062
01:03:21.032 --> 01:03:22.366
<i>Because, ultimately,</i>

1063
01:03:23.242 --> 01:03:24.869
abortion is not about whether or not

1064
01:03:24.952 --> 01:03:27.997
women should have
particular medical procedures.


1065
01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:29.165
It's about equality.

1066
01:03:29.248 --> 01:03:33.294
It's about a view of life,
about who should make important decisions.


1067
01:03:37.048 --> 01:03:39.258
<i>It's very rare that you know the date</i>

1068
01:03:39.467 --> 01:03:41.761
<i>that the Supreme Court is going</i>
<i>to issue a decision.</i>


1069
01:03:42.136 --> 01:03:45.598
You know that the case will be decided,
but you don't know when.


1070
01:03:47.141 --> 01:03:50.311
<i>But this time we knew when,</i>
<i>because every other case</i>


1071
01:03:50.978 --> 01:03:53.314
<i>that they heard that term</i>
<i>had already been decided.</i>


1072
01:03:54.273 --> 01:03:56.567
We're waiting outside
the Supreme Court now


1073
01:03:56.651 --> 01:03:58.861
for the announcement
of the Court's decision.


1074
01:04:00.321 --> 01:04:03.950
<i>So, there were media trucks</i>
<i>parked outside.</i>


1075
01:04:04.492 --> 01:04:08.746
<i>Everybody was ready and waiting</i>
<i>for the overturning of Roe.</i>


1076
01:04:10.957 --> 01:04:13.209
Release 91-45 Standing Orders.

1077
01:04:14.835 --> 01:04:18.339
<i>The clerk of the court handed me</i>
<i>a copy of the decision.</i>


1078
01:04:18.589 --> 01:04:21.634
<i>And frankly I was confused</i>
<i>in many respects.</i>


1079
01:04:22.218 --> 01:04:24.762
<i>You know, it's a 50, 60 page opinion.</i>
<i>It's complicated.</i>


1080
01:04:24.845 --> 01:04:26.722
<i>You have to read it and understand it.</i>

1081
01:04:27.098 --> 01:04:30.476
At the same time,
I'm shepherded out to talk to


1082
01:04:30.977 --> 01:04:33.646
American media about what just happened.

1083
01:04:34.230 --> 01:04:37.692
I am Kathryn Kolbert.
I am counsel of record on behalf of


1084
01:04:38.067 --> 01:04:41.445
Planned Parenthood and the other
abortion clinics in Pennsylvania.


1085
01:04:41.529 --> 01:04:43.322
<i>It was a very ambiguous decision.</i>

1086
01:04:43.948 --> 01:04:46.826
Three Republican-appointed justices
had gotten together,


1087
01:04:48.244 --> 01:04:51.330
<i>and they decided that</i>
<i>rather than overturn Roe against Wade,</i>


1088
01:04:51.455 --> 01:04:53.040
<i>they were going to reformulate it...</i>

1089
01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.669
<i>with what they called</i>
<i>the undue burden standard.</i>


1090
01:04:58.546 --> 01:05:00.881
<i>So the Court upheld the right to abortion.</i>

1091
01:05:01.549 --> 01:05:05.428
<i>But the new standard meant</i>
<i>that states can undertake</i>


1092
01:05:05.511 --> 01:05:09.890
to persuade a woman to carry
a pregnancy to term,


1093
01:05:10.641 --> 01:05:14.311
but they cannot prevent a woman
from choosing abortion.


1094
01:05:15.062 --> 01:05:16.355
<i>Under Roe versus Wade,</i>

1095
01:05:16.939 --> 01:05:19.567
<i>most abortion restrictions</i>
<i>were unconstitutional.</i>


1096
01:05:20.609 --> 01:05:23.070
<i>In Casey, the Court basically said that</i>

1097
01:05:23.154 --> 01:05:27.783
<i>states had the latitude to restrict</i>
<i>abortion in more ways than under Roe.</i>


1098
01:05:27.992 --> 01:05:31.829
Many, many kinds of restrictions,
waiting periods, informed consent.


1099
01:05:32.121 --> 01:05:36.876
Things found unconstitutional under Roe
have been validated by this Court.


1100
01:05:37.460 --> 01:05:41.130
And therefore we are much worse off
than we have been in the past.


1101
01:05:41.672 --> 01:05:44.675
<i>At the time, I thought, you know,</i>
<i>this is really horrible.</i>


1102
01:05:44.925 --> 01:05:46.844
...to place roadblocks
in the path of women...


1103
01:05:47.219 --> 01:05:51.057
<i>But whatever problems</i>
<i>the undue burden standard gave us,</i>


1104
01:05:51.766 --> 01:05:55.102
it was still preferable
than a total outlaw of abortion.


1105
01:05:55.186 --> 01:05:57.480
For a woman in need
of a medical procedure,


1106
01:05:57.938 --> 01:06:00.357
there's a big difference between having
to jump through hoops


1107
01:06:00.441 --> 01:06:02.359
<i>and not being able</i>
<i>to get the procedure at all.</i>


1108
01:06:03.819 --> 01:06:07.573
Four justices have said
Roe versus Wade must be overturned.


1109
01:06:08.324 --> 01:06:10.367
All it's going to take is one more

1110
01:06:10.659 --> 01:06:13.537
and I can only hope
that President Bush gets reelected.


1111
01:06:20.002 --> 01:06:22.713
It makes a difference
whether the president believes


1112
01:06:22.797 --> 01:06:25.549
in a woman's right
to choose. And I do.

1113
01:06:28.427 --> 01:06:30.096
<i>There was some momentum</i>

1114
01:06:30.179 --> 01:06:34.391
around the Clintons
and support for abortion rights.


1115
01:06:35.059 --> 01:06:38.187
<i>I am proud to nominate</i>
<i>Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg to</i>


1116
01:06:38.270 --> 01:06:39.230
<i>the Supreme Court.</i>

1117
01:06:39.313 --> 01:06:43.692
It is essential to woman's equality
with man


1118
01:06:43.776 --> 01:06:46.028
<i>that she be the decision-maker.</i>

1119
01:06:46.821 --> 01:06:49.281
<i>I'm proud to nominate</i>
<i>Judge Stephen Breyer</i>


1120
01:06:49.448 --> 01:06:51.408
<i>to serve on the United States</i>
<i>Supreme Court.</i>


1121
01:06:51.700 --> 01:06:53.911
<i>And there were bills pending</i>
<i>at the federal level</i>


1122
01:06:53.994 --> 01:06:56.622
<i>to protect access to abortion.</i>

1123
01:06:58.040 --> 01:07:01.127
The Clinton team has begun
to systematically wage war


1124
01:07:01.418 --> 01:07:02.795
against unborn children.

1125
01:07:03.462 --> 01:07:07.091
<i>And abortion opponents were looking</i>
<i>for a way to stop this momentum.</i>


1126
01:07:07.967 --> 01:07:10.845
So they came up with this new
idea and they honed in on later abortion.

1127
01:07:13.889 --> 01:07:16.976
Specifically they came up
with the term "partial birth abortion."


1128
01:07:21.438 --> 01:07:25.234
Some of you stay on this side,
some of you go on the other side, okay?


1129
01:07:25.317 --> 01:07:30.114
Not everyone. Try and spread out and get
the signs as many places as possible. <i>Partial birth took off like</i>
<i>wildfire inside the pro-life movement.</i>


1130
01:07:35.452 --> 01:07:38.497
<i>It so horrified and shocked the conscience</i>

1131
01:07:39.039 --> 01:07:41.542
<i>and stripped this veil of respectability</i>

1132
01:07:41.625 --> 01:07:43.794
<i>from Planned Parenthood</i>
<i>and the abortionists.</i>


1133
01:07:43.878 --> 01:07:46.672
<i>It's terrible. Which side of the fence</i>
<i>are we gonna be on?</i>


1134
01:07:46.755 --> 01:07:48.382
We had to educate the public.

1135
01:07:48.465 --> 01:07:51.886
Are we gonna continue to support child
killing in America and call it choice?


1136
01:07:51.969 --> 01:07:56.140
We made it an issue.
We forced it on America.


1137
01:07:59.476 --> 01:08:01.187
This is partial birth abortion.

1138
01:08:01.687 --> 01:08:05.608
<i>The abortionist grabs the live baby's legs</i>
<i>with forceps.</i>


1139
01:08:06.192 --> 01:08:09.361
<i>The Republicans introduced</i>
<i>the partial birth abortion law,</i>


1140
01:08:09.862 --> 01:08:11.488
<i>even though there's no such thing.</i>

1141
01:08:11.947 --> 01:08:15.075
<i>They made up the word</i>
<i>and it was a strategy</i>


1142
01:08:15.159 --> 01:08:17.244
<i>that really went to challenging</i>

1143
01:08:17.369 --> 01:08:20.164
the question of when late abortion
would be permitted.


1144
01:08:20.789 --> 01:08:24.168
With the idea that,
if you could push it earlier and earlier,


1145
01:08:24.335 --> 01:08:26.795
you could eliminate a number of abortions

1146
01:08:26.879 --> 01:08:30.883
And we knew immediately
that this was going to be a huge issue.


1147
01:08:30.966 --> 01:08:34.720
Abortion advocates are claiming that,
by banning partial-birth abortion,


1148
01:08:34.803 --> 01:08:37.556
we are mounting a direct attack
on Roe versus Wade.


1149
01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:41.518
For them, there is never an instance
when abortion is inappropriate.


1150
01:08:41.769 --> 01:08:44.313
For them,
the right to abortion is absolute


1151
01:08:44.396 --> 01:08:48.234
at whatever time, for whatever reason,
and in whatever way,


1152
01:08:48.359 --> 01:08:50.486
a woman or an abortionist chooses.

1153
01:08:51.487 --> 01:08:54.406
Ninety percent of women who have an
abortion have it in the first trimester.


1154
01:08:54.907 --> 01:08:56.951
<i>That's the vast majority of women.</i>

1155
01:08:57.326 --> 01:09:00.621
<i>And then a smaller proportion have it</i>
<i>before 20 weeks.</i>


1156
01:09:01.288 --> 01:09:04.375
<i>Between 20 and 24 weeks,</i>
<i>we're at probably about one percent.</i>


1157
01:09:04.458 --> 01:09:07.628
<i>And then, as we get further along, we're</i>
<i>getting to smaller and smaller numbers,</i>


1158
01:09:07.711 --> 01:09:09.213
<i>exceedingly low numbers.</i>

1159
01:09:09.546 --> 01:09:12.341
<i>So the majority of abortions</i>
<i>are in the first trimester.</i>


1160
01:09:12.675 --> 01:09:15.010
<i>But we spend most of our time</i>
<i>talking about</i>


1161
01:09:15.177 --> 01:09:17.471
<i>abortions that happened</i>
<i>in the second and third trimester.</i>


1162
01:09:17.763 --> 01:09:20.849
<i>And this is one of the strategies</i>
<i>of the anti-choice movement.</i>


1163
01:09:21.016 --> 01:09:23.143
Why do we call something
the partial-birth abortion,


1164
01:09:23.227 --> 01:09:25.271
when really that's not a medical term.

1165
01:09:25.354 --> 01:09:27.523
You always go after your enemy
where they're the weakest.


1166
01:09:27.606 --> 01:09:31.402
And they know that,
once we win, in the ninth month,


1167
01:09:31.568 --> 01:09:33.862
the rest of the card house
comes crumbling down.


1168
01:09:33.946 --> 01:09:35.239
We destroy their arguments.

1169
01:09:36.031 --> 01:09:38.075
They created a narrative that

1170
01:09:38.742 --> 01:09:40.619
women late in pregnancies were

1171
01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:44.832
killing their babies 'cause they,
you know, wanted to go to the gym instead.


1172
01:09:45.666 --> 01:09:48.043
Totally false. 
Doesn't happen.

1173
01:09:48.669 --> 01:09:52.923
<i>But there's no 30-second sound bite</i>
<i>to counter that image.</i>


1174
01:09:53.340 --> 01:09:56.218
<i>They were very good at creating optics,</i>

1175
01:09:56.385 --> 01:09:59.346
<i>creating language that supported</i>
<i>their point of view.</i>


1176
01:09:59.722 --> 01:10:03.434
<i>And so we had to figure out</i>
<i>how to challenge it politically.</i>


1177
01:10:03.726 --> 01:10:06.145
<i>And we were able</i>
<i>to introduce President Clinton</i>


1178
01:10:06.228 --> 01:10:10.065
<i>to women who would be affected</i>
<i>by the law.</i>


1179
01:10:10.441 --> 01:10:11.358
<i>Women who were</i>

1180
01:10:11.942 --> 01:10:15.195
losing pregnancies very late
or finding themselves


1181
01:10:15.487 --> 01:10:18.073
carrying a pregnancy
with very severe fetal anomalies.


1182
01:10:18.157 --> 01:10:21.660
Good morning. I'd like to thank
the subcommittee for inviting me here.


1183
01:10:22.369 --> 01:10:26.123
I went in for
a routine seven-month ultrasound.


1184
01:10:27.249 --> 01:10:30.294
They were saying,
"This looks good. This looks good."


1185
01:10:31.128 --> 01:10:33.464
Then suddenly, they got really quiet.

1186
01:10:34.465 --> 01:10:35.299
The doctor said,

1187
01:10:36.133 --> 01:10:39.094
"Your daughter has no eyes,
and her heart...


1188
01:10:40.554 --> 01:10:42.973
and other major organs are also failing.

1189
01:10:44.266 --> 01:10:46.602
And your child will not live."

1190
01:10:50.564 --> 01:10:54.735
I remember just looking out the window.
I couldn't look at anybody.


1191
01:10:56.528 --> 01:11:01.784
So my mother-in-law asked, "Do we go on?
Does she have to go on?"


1192
01:11:04.328 --> 01:11:07.331
<i>This terrible problem affects</i>
<i>a few hundred Americans</i>


1193
01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:08.916
every year,

1194
01:11:09.833 --> 01:11:11.543
who desperately want their children,

1195
01:11:11.627 --> 01:11:14.546
are trying to building families and are
trying to strengthen their families.


1196
01:11:15.422 --> 01:11:17.049
And they should not become

1197
01:11:17.132 --> 01:11:19.676
<i>pawns in a larger debate.</i>

1198
01:11:19.927 --> 01:11:22.221
<i>And therefore I had no choice</i>
<i>but to veto the bill.</i>


1199
01:11:22.304 --> 01:11:25.849
- I vetoed it just a few minutes ago before I met with these families.
-  Bill Clinton vetoed it, but it really spread.


1200
01:11:31.146 --> 01:11:34.983
And we started to see
new iterations of these bills,


1201
01:11:35.067 --> 01:11:38.737
using slightly different language,
in order to withstand a legal challenge.


1202
01:11:42.157 --> 01:11:45.702
It's a shame that child sacrifice
can be allowed in this country.


1203
01:11:45.786 --> 01:11:50.874
We are being arrested for speaking
and showing the truth of abortion.


1204
01:11:50.958 --> 01:11:52.418
Okay, careful. 
Walk carefully.

1205
01:11:52.501 --> 01:11:55.003
<i>We need to ban</i>
<i>partial-birth abortions. I believe</i>


1206
01:11:55.087 --> 01:11:57.256
banning partial-birth abortions would be

1207
01:11:57.339 --> 01:12:01.844
a positive step toward reducing
the number of abortions in America.


1208
01:12:03.262 --> 01:12:06.723
We were able to get George W. Bush
elected with the promise that,


1209
01:12:06.807 --> 01:12:09.893
if we got another ban,
he'd pass it again and sign it.


1210
01:12:11.228 --> 01:12:13.897
<i>And he signed the federal ban into law,</i>

1211
01:12:14.648 --> 01:12:16.150
<i>and it went to the Supreme Court.</i>

1212
01:12:16.233 --> 01:12:19.862
Hey, hey! Hi, ho!
Anti-choice has got to go!


1213
01:12:19.945 --> 01:12:22.906
<i>The issue of abortion's</i>
<i>before the Supreme Court.</i>


1214
01:12:23.740 --> 01:12:27.453
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor announced
this morning that she will retire.


1215
01:12:28.245 --> 01:12:30.873
<i>Chief Justice William Rehnquist has died.</i>

1216
01:12:31.081 --> 01:12:32.499
<i>The nomination power is one</i>

1217
01:12:32.583 --> 01:12:34.585
<i>of the most serious responsibilities</i>
<i>of a president.</i>


1218
01:12:35.294 --> 01:12:37.546
<i>I will nominate Judge Roberts</i>
<i>to the Supreme Court.</i>


1219
01:12:38.672 --> 01:12:41.175
And Chief Justice Roberts will have
as his colleague


1220
01:12:41.258 --> 01:12:43.218
<i>a proud member of</i>
<i>The Federalist Society,</i>


1221
01:12:43.844 --> 01:12:45.596
<i>Judge Sam Alito, Jr.</i>

1222
01:12:46.972 --> 01:12:50.184
<i>In a 5-4 landmark decision,</i>
<i>the Court's new conservative majority</i>


1223
01:12:50.267 --> 01:12:52.603
<i>today upheld a nationwide ban</i>

1224
01:12:52.978 --> 01:12:55.272
<i>on a procedure critics call</i>
<i>partial-birth abortion.</i>


1225
01:12:55.772 --> 01:12:58.734
<i>In court, an angry</i>
<i>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</i>


1226
01:12:58.817 --> 01:13:01.862
<i>took the unusual step of</i>
<i>reading her dissent aloud.</i>


1227
01:13:03.739 --> 01:13:08.410
<i>I strongly dissent from today's opinion.</i>

1228
01:13:09.203 --> 01:13:13.207
<i>The Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act</i>
<i>cannot be understood</i>


1229
01:13:13.290 --> 01:13:15.792
<i>as anything other than an effort</i>

1230
01:13:16.168 --> 01:13:18.003
<i>to chip away at a right</i>

1231
01:13:18.420 --> 01:13:20.714
<i>declared in Roe v. Wade.</i>

1232
01:13:24.551 --> 01:13:25.886
<i>Roe versus Wade</i>

1233
01:13:27.054 --> 01:13:29.306
<i>prevents us from prohibiting abortion.</i>

1234
01:13:29.473 --> 01:13:30.974
<i>But it does allow us,</i>

1235
01:13:31.975 --> 01:13:33.936
<i>the states, to...</i>

1236
01:13:34.436 --> 01:13:36.563
do some things to protect life,

1237
01:13:37.064 --> 01:13:41.485
if they can show there is
a compelling state interest.


1238
01:13:42.027 --> 01:13:45.531
Governor Rick Perry wanted to end
access to reproductive health care.


1239
01:13:45.948 --> 01:13:48.867
And because the legislature is
so disproportionately


1240
01:13:49.201 --> 01:13:51.411
uh, led by the Republican party,

1241
01:13:51.828 --> 01:13:56.041
<i>they proposed abortion restrictions, which</i>
<i>were the most extreme in the country.</i>


1242
01:13:57.459 --> 01:14:02.256
House Bill 2 was a good example of these
kinds of laws that were being passed in


1243
01:14:02.756 --> 01:14:04.758
<i>many states controlled by the Republicans.</i>

1244
01:14:05.175 --> 01:14:08.637
<i>Laws that really focused</i>
<i>on where the abortion could be performed</i>


1245
01:14:08.929 --> 01:14:13.183
<i>and regulations to either the doctor's</i>
<i>office or a surgical center.</i>


1246
01:14:13.267 --> 01:14:15.644
Thank you for calling
the Southwestern Women's Surgery Center.


1247
01:14:15.727 --> 01:14:17.437
This is Alicia. 
How may I help you?

1248
01:14:17.521 --> 01:14:20.107
This is what are known as
TRAP laws: Targeted Regulation of Abortion Providers.

1249
01:14:23.944 --> 01:14:27.739
And the purpose of these laws is
to make it as difficult as possible


1250
01:14:27.948 --> 01:14:29.324
<i>to provide abortion services,</i>

1251
01:14:29.741 --> 01:14:31.868
prohibit as many abortions as you can,

1252
01:14:32.035 --> 01:14:34.329
make the ones that do occur
as expensive as possible.


1253
01:14:34.413 --> 01:14:35.956
<i>It's so obvious what they're doing.</i>

1254
01:14:37.833 --> 01:14:40.544
My goal is to make abortion,

1255
01:14:40.752 --> 01:14:43.672
at any stage, a thing of the past.

1256
01:14:46.883 --> 01:14:50.262
So these restrictions would shut down
dozens of women's health centers


1257
01:14:50.345 --> 01:14:51.597
<i>all across Texas.</i>

1258
01:14:52.222 --> 01:14:54.433
<i>And that's why Senator Wendy Davis</i>

1259
01:14:54.516 --> 01:14:57.144
<i>decided to stand up and fight</i>
<i>for the rights of women.</i>


1260
01:15:00.147 --> 01:15:02.065
<i>So this bill went to the Senate.</i>

1261
01:15:02.941 --> 01:15:07.446
<i>But, because it was the final day</i>
<i>of the session, the clock was ticking.</i>


1262
01:15:07.988 --> 01:15:11.617
<i>And that gave me an opportunity</i>
<i>for the filibuster.</i>


1263
01:15:11.992 --> 01:15:14.286
Members, I'm rising on the floor today...

1264
01:15:14.494 --> 01:15:20.083
That meant I had about 13 hours of talking
to make sure that this bill did not pass.


1265
01:15:21.752 --> 01:15:24.921
<i>The rules in Texas say</i>
<i>that you cannot have a sip of water,</i>


1266
01:15:25.005 --> 01:15:26.423
<i>you cannot have anything to drink,</i>

1267
01:15:26.506 --> 01:15:30.218
<i>you cannot lean on your desk</i>
<i>and you certainly cannot leave the floor</i>


1268
01:15:30.510 --> 01:15:31.637
<i>to go to the restroom.</i>

1269
01:15:32.596 --> 01:15:38.060
So I had a pair of running shoes
on my feet and I had a catheter bag.


1270
01:15:38.143 --> 01:15:41.313
A doctor had come over
at about six o'clock that morning


1271
01:15:41.438 --> 01:15:45.108
and inserted a catheter so that
I'd be able to make it through the day.


1272
01:15:46.318 --> 01:15:48.570
Senator Wendy Davis must make it
to midnight.


1273
01:15:48.654 --> 01:15:50.572
That is the end of the special session.

1274
01:15:50.781 --> 01:15:53.700
Essentially she's wasting time,
running out the clock.


1275
01:15:53.784 --> 01:15:57.329
The way she's doing that? Right now,
she's reading letters from Texas women


1276
01:15:57.621 --> 01:15:59.498
<i>who oppose this legislation.</i>

1277
01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:02.668
...in order for their voices to be heard.

1278
01:16:02.751 --> 01:16:06.380
- ...told me any pregnancy will be very...
<i>- And the filibuster went viral.</i>


1279
01:16:06.963 --> 01:16:08.632
Not only was she a woman

1280
01:16:08.757 --> 01:16:12.344
opposing the bill, but she was one
of the only women in the room.


1281
01:16:12.803 --> 01:16:15.222
<i>It was an internet moment.</i> <i>People had left their kids</i>
<i>with their neighbors</i>


1282
01:16:23.939 --> 01:16:25.899
<i>and driven hours to Austin to be there.</i>

1283
01:16:26.441 --> 01:16:28.652
<i>Students had left their college campuses</i>

1284
01:16:28.735 --> 01:16:31.363
<i>and came to Austin</i>
<i>to hear Wendy filibuster.</i>


1285
01:16:32.072 --> 01:16:34.449
These are Texans who relied
on the minority...


1286
01:16:34.533 --> 01:16:35.909
<i>I'm a Texan.</i>

1287
01:16:35.992 --> 01:16:39.204
<i>Never seen the outpouring of activism</i>
<i>like we saw there.</i>


1288
01:16:39.579 --> 01:16:41.832
You literally could not get
in the capitol.


1289
01:16:41.998 --> 01:16:44.668
Every annex was full, every room was full.

1290
01:16:45.585 --> 01:16:46.628
<i>It was extraordinary.</i>

1291
01:16:46.920 --> 01:16:49.756
...another ruling she made
was if there was a...


1292
01:16:49.965 --> 01:16:52.759
<i>And about 15 minutes</i>
<i>before midnight,</i>


1293
01:16:53.260 --> 01:16:55.804
<i>procedural rules of order were broken...</i>

1294
01:16:56.513 --> 01:16:57.597
<i>...and the third...</i>

1295
01:16:57.723 --> 01:17:00.392
<i>...in order to bring</i>
<i>my filibuster to an end.</i>


1296
01:17:01.393 --> 01:17:03.854
<i>And the people who were there</i>
<i>understood</i>


1297
01:17:03.937 --> 01:17:08.442
<i>that rules were being broken</i>
<i>in order to silence opposition to a bill.</i>


1298
01:17:08.525 --> 01:17:11.403
After consultation
with the parliamentarian and after...


1299
01:17:11.570 --> 01:17:14.698
- <i>And they'd had enough.</i>
- ...well taken and is sustained.


1300
01:17:15.115 --> 01:17:15.991
Bullshit!

1301
01:17:16.074 --> 01:17:18.285
The chair recognizes Senator...

1302
01:17:19.661 --> 01:17:22.539
Let her speak!
Let her speak! Let her speak!


1303
01:17:22.622 --> 01:17:25.167
Let her speak! Let her speak!
Let her speak!


1304
01:17:29.421 --> 01:17:32.007
Wendy! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy!

1305
01:17:32.090 --> 01:17:34.968
Wendy! Wendy!
Wendy! Wendy!


1306
01:17:35.051 --> 01:17:37.554
Wendy! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy!

1307
01:17:39.431 --> 01:17:41.349
<i>And as they began to scream,</i>

1308
01:17:42.309 --> 01:17:45.312
<i>everyone up and down the hallways</i>
<i>began to scream,</i>


1309
01:17:45.395 --> 01:17:49.274
<i>and at every level of the rotunda</i>
<i>and outside on the capitol lawn.</i>


1310
01:17:51.026 --> 01:17:53.028
<i>And I could literally feel</i>

1311
01:17:53.111 --> 01:17:56.406
<i>the vibration of their voices</i>
<i>and their energy</i>


1312
01:17:56.490 --> 01:17:58.033
<i>and the pounding of their feet.</i>

1313
01:17:58.617 --> 01:18:01.661
If I can have order.
We are in the middle of a vote.


1314
01:18:03.121 --> 01:18:04.539
The secretary has started the vote.

1315
01:18:05.123 --> 01:18:07.167
<i>It ate up enough of the clock</i>

1316
01:18:07.250 --> 01:18:11.046
<i>that the final vote wasn't taken</i>
<i>until 12:03.</i>


1317
01:18:11.379 --> 01:18:14.966
Members, it's now past midnight. And so...

1318
01:18:15.050 --> 01:18:18.303
And it became known
as the people's filibuster. Rightly so.


1319
01:18:19.304 --> 01:18:21.640
This is straight from
Senator Wendy Davis, okay?


1320
01:18:22.015 --> 01:18:22.849
Hold your applause.

1321
01:18:23.892 --> 01:18:26.311
First, "I love you guys." Okay? -
- We love you, too, Wendy!


1322
01:18:34.611 --> 01:18:39.574
"So the lieutenant governor has agreed
that SB-5 is dead."


1323
01:18:55.340 --> 01:18:58.301
<i>The woman who filibustered</i>
<i>the Senate the other day,</i>


1324
01:19:00.053 --> 01:19:02.681
<i>she was born into difficult circumstances.</i>

1325
01:19:03.098 --> 01:19:04.850
<i>She's the daughter of a single woman.</i>

1326
01:19:05.559 --> 01:19:07.477
<i>She was a teenage mother herself.</i>

1327
01:19:08.144 --> 01:19:12.357
<i>She managed to eventually graduate</i>
<i>from Harvard Law School</i>


1328
01:19:12.732 --> 01:19:14.818
<i>and serve in the Texas Senate.</i>

1329
01:19:16.027 --> 01:19:17.028
<i>It's unfortunate</i>

1330
01:19:17.779 --> 01:19:20.115
that she hasn't learned
from her own example


1331
01:19:20.699 --> 01:19:24.703
that every life must be given a chance
to realize its full potential


1332
01:19:24.786 --> 01:19:26.621
and that every life matters.

1333
01:19:28.248 --> 01:19:30.166
<i>We had successfully</i>
<i>killed the bill.</i>


1334
01:19:30.250 --> 01:19:32.878
But we were called right back
within a few days.


1335
01:19:33.211 --> 01:19:37.340
And, of course, this time
there was no way to filibuster.


1336
01:19:37.507 --> 01:19:41.428
<i>♪ Where have all the babies gone?♪</i>

1337
01:19:41.678 --> 01:19:46.182
<i>♪ I pray to heaven for every one♪</i>

1338
01:19:46.266 --> 01:19:47.934
<i>Get ready to do it all again.</i>

1339
01:19:48.018 --> 01:19:51.021
<i>Governor Rick Perry called</i>
<i>a special session early this evening.</i>


1340
01:19:54.357 --> 01:19:56.276
We talked about the choice.

1341
01:19:56.443 --> 01:19:59.446
Do you think if the mother had
a conversation with the baby and said,


1342
01:19:59.654 --> 01:20:03.116
"You know, this just isn't really
convenient to give birth to you right now.


1343
01:20:03.283 --> 01:20:04.576
Do you mind dying?"

1344
01:20:04.743 --> 01:20:06.161
I can't take it anymore!

1345
01:20:07.162 --> 01:20:09.748
-I think--
-That was very offensive!


1346
01:20:10.040 --> 01:20:12.042
I think that baby would say--

1347
01:20:12.792 --> 01:20:14.628
This is an assault on women!

1348
01:20:16.588 --> 01:20:18.632
I don't get mad with those folks.
I pray for her.


1349
01:20:18.715 --> 01:20:19.925
You are failing Texas!

1350
01:20:20.675 --> 01:20:22.969
You are failing Texas!

1351
01:20:31.603 --> 01:20:33.146
In just a few moments,

1352
01:20:33.688 --> 01:20:35.565
we are going to vote on a bill

1353
01:20:35.649 --> 01:20:39.861
that has deeply and profoundly divided us.

1354
01:20:40.904 --> 01:20:42.906
<i>Separating us by political party...</i>

1355
01:20:44.658 --> 01:20:45.784
<i>by gender...</i>

1356
01:20:46.409 --> 01:20:48.036
<i>by life experience...</i>

1357
01:20:48.620 --> 01:20:51.373
<i>by what our religious beliefs bind us to.</i>

1358
01:20:51.456 --> 01:20:53.541
Not in this life!

1359
01:20:53.708 --> 01:20:59.005
<i>We all believe in the beauty</i>
<i>and the wonder that is human life.</i>


1360
01:21:00.465 --> 01:21:03.468
<i>But I also believe that women already here</i>

1361
01:21:04.469 --> 01:21:05.470
<i>are beautiful.</i>

1362
01:21:06.513 --> 01:21:08.264
<i>And that they deserve to live,</i>

1363
01:21:09.224 --> 01:21:12.936
<i>they deserve to determine</i>
<i>the direction of their lives,</i>


1364
01:21:13.728 --> 01:21:17.983
<i>they deserve to be recognized</i>
<i>as full people...</i>


1365
01:21:20.026 --> 01:21:23.196
<i>fully capable</i>
<i>of making difficult decisions</i>


1366
01:21:23.446 --> 01:21:27.742
<i>with the help of their family,</i>
<i>their doctor and their God.</i>


1367
01:21:28.243 --> 01:21:31.246
Wendy! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy!

1368
01:21:31.329 --> 01:21:34.874
Wendy! Wendy!
Wendy! Wendy!


1369
01:21:36.543 --> 01:21:39.337
No woman should be judged by someone else,

1370
01:21:40.005 --> 01:21:43.717
someone who believes
they would have made a different decision.


1371
01:21:45.051 --> 01:21:47.887
No woman should be judged by someone else,

1372
01:21:48.638 --> 01:21:52.809
because these decisions
are never ever easy.


1373
01:21:53.852 --> 01:21:56.521
They're not made casually or quickly.

1374
01:21:56.855 --> 01:22:01.860
And those of us in the Senate
should refuse to make this decision


1375
01:22:02.402 --> 01:22:04.487
casually or quickly.

1376
01:22:04.988 --> 01:22:07.657
Because the fight for the future of Texas

1377
01:22:08.324 --> 01:22:09.492
is just beginning.

1378
01:22:10.535 --> 01:22:12.245
Thank you, Mr. President.
Thank you, members.


1379
01:22:14.330 --> 01:22:18.710
There being 19 ayes and 11 nays,
House Bill 2 is finally passed.


1380
01:22:18.793 --> 01:22:22.922
We won't go back! 
We won't go back!

1381
01:22:23.381 --> 01:22:26.593
We won't go back!
We won't go back!


1382
01:22:26.676 --> 01:22:27.510
Come on!

1383
01:22:27.886 --> 01:22:29.262
We won't go back! 
We won't go back!

1384
01:22:33.558 --> 01:22:37.479
It is our responsibility to improve
the quality of care for women


1385
01:22:37.562 --> 01:22:38.438
in the state.

1386
01:22:39.564 --> 01:22:42.192
<i>Of course, the argument was made</i>
<i>all along that somehow</i>


1387
01:22:42.442 --> 01:22:44.944
this is being done in the interests
of women's health.


1388
01:22:45.320 --> 01:22:50.658
And in spite of incredible scientific
pushback to that statement,


1389
01:22:50.784 --> 01:22:52.410
House Bill 2 passed.

1390
01:22:52.952 --> 01:22:55.246
Shame! Shame! Shame!

1391
01:22:55.705 --> 01:22:56.998
Shame! Shame! Shame!

1392
01:23:01.127 --> 01:23:06.132
<i>The law went into effect and over half of</i>
<i>our abortion clinics in the state closed.</i>


1393
01:23:09.844 --> 01:23:12.639
<i>We went from 41 clinics to 19</i>

1394
01:23:12.722 --> 01:23:15.141
<i>as a consequence</i>
<i>of the implementation of the law.</i>


1395
01:23:16.810 --> 01:23:18.353
<i>In central Texas,</i>

1396
01:23:18.645 --> 01:23:20.396
<i>there were no clinics left open.</i>

1397
01:23:21.940 --> 01:23:23.983
<i>And that was pretty demoralizing.</i>

1398
01:23:24.943 --> 01:23:28.279
<i>But there was something really important</i>
<i>that had happened.</i>


1399
01:23:29.030 --> 01:23:34.577
We as a state woke up to the reality
of an assault on women.


1400
01:23:35.328 --> 01:23:38.164
We woke up to
the reality of our power.

1401
01:23:39.040 --> 01:23:42.377
And it's a power that has continued
to grow.


1402
01:23:47.132 --> 01:23:50.343
<i>The first major abortion case</i>
<i>in almost a decade.</i>


1403
01:23:50.426 --> 01:23:54.430
<i>It centers on a case in Texas</i>
<i>that has already forced clinics to close</i>


1404
01:23:54.514 --> 01:23:56.766
<i>and could force even more</i>
<i>to close down as well.</i>


1405
01:23:57.851 --> 01:24:02.105
The stakes are huge. And they're not just
huge for Texas women.


1406
01:24:02.605 --> 01:24:04.649
They're huge for women
all over the country.


1407
01:24:05.108 --> 01:24:06.651
Anti-choice! Anti-women!

1408
01:24:06.734 --> 01:24:10.280
<i>If the Court affirms</i>
<i>the law in Texas,</i>


1409
01:24:10.446 --> 01:24:14.450
<i>I have no doubt that other states</i>
<i>will immediately follow suit.</i>


1410
01:24:15.034 --> 01:24:17.787
<i>And so many women will no longer</i>
<i>have access</i>


1411
01:24:18.496 --> 01:24:19.581
<i>to abortion care.</i>

1412
01:24:27.839 --> 01:24:31.009
<i>It's almost like a perfect</i>
<i>controlled experiment, isn't it?</i>


1413
01:24:31.259 --> 01:24:33.094
<i>It's like you put the law into effect,</i>

1414
01:24:33.344 --> 01:24:37.223
<i>twelve clinics closed. You take the law</i>
<i>out of the fact, they reopen.</i>


1415
01:24:37.473 --> 01:24:39.184
<i>That's absolutely correct.</i>

1416
01:24:39.267 --> 01:24:42.437
I went to the argument,
and I was struck by


1417
01:24:42.937 --> 01:24:48.067
the difference between a Court
with one female justice


1418
01:24:48.151 --> 01:24:49.986
and a Court with three.

1419
01:24:51.070 --> 01:24:52.989
<i>Can I walk through the burden?</i>

1420
01:24:53.281 --> 01:24:56.868
<i>She has to travel 200 miles</i>
<i>to get two days of treatment.</i>


1421
01:24:57.327 --> 01:25:01.080
<i>How many women</i>
<i>are located over 100 miles...</i>


1422
01:25:01.164 --> 01:25:04.000
<i>The women could reinforce</i>
<i>each other's viewpoints.</i>


1423
01:25:04.083 --> 01:25:05.960
<i>There has to some tie between</i>

1424
01:25:06.044 --> 01:25:07.587
<i>benefit and burden, doesn't there?</i>

1425
01:25:07.670 --> 01:25:09.505
<i>I think they were very good</i>

1426
01:25:09.589 --> 01:25:12.800
at throwing aside
all of these specious arguments,


1427
01:25:12.884 --> 01:25:15.929
that the state was making that
really all they cared about was women.


1428
01:25:16.638 --> 01:25:19.182
<i>There are benefits for the ASC</i>
<i>and admitting-privileges...</i>


1429
01:25:19.265 --> 01:25:21.851
<i>What is the benefit...</i>
<i>What evidence is there...</i>


1430
01:25:21.976 --> 01:25:23.978
Just said, "You know, what's going on here

1431
01:25:24.062 --> 01:25:28.149
is you are making it more difficult
for women to exercise their choice...


1432
01:25:28.650 --> 01:25:32.195
<i>This is one of the lowest-risk procedures.</i>

1433
01:25:32.278 --> 01:25:34.656
<i>...and we are going to respect</i>
<i>her decision."</i>


1434
01:25:34.739 --> 01:25:37.158
<i>...this law was targeted at abortion only.</i>

1435
01:25:37.242 --> 01:25:39.786
<i>...many procedures</i>
<i>are much higher risk:</i>


1436
01:25:39.869 --> 01:25:42.830
<i>colonoscopies, liposuctions.</i>
<i>We could go on and on.</i>


1437
01:25:43.456 --> 01:25:45.667
And I have to tell you,
they took over that argument.


1438
01:25:48.127 --> 01:25:52.674
<i>What it's about is that</i>
<i>a woman has a fundamental right</i>


1439
01:25:53.258 --> 01:25:55.051
<i>to make this choice for herself.</i>

1440
01:25:56.928 --> 01:25:59.555
Today the Supreme Court struck down
a Texas law


1441
01:25:59.722 --> 01:26:02.600
that imposed strict requirements
on clinics and doctors,


1442
01:26:02.934 --> 01:26:07.188
finding those limits place an undue burden
on the constitutional right to abortion.


1443
01:26:12.151 --> 01:26:14.862
<i>For me, the highlight of that decision was</i>

1444
01:26:14.946 --> 01:26:18.491
<i>the justices' incorporation</i>
<i>of actual medicine and science.</i>


1445
01:26:22.287 --> 01:26:24.998
<i>We've seen a decision about abortion</i> that says,
"If you're going to make a claim,


1446
01:26:27.875 --> 01:26:30.128
the claim must be factually accurate."

1447
01:26:30.211 --> 01:26:31.713
<i>But the reality is</i>

1448
01:26:31.796 --> 01:26:35.550
<i>that the appointing of our justices</i>
<i>is highly political.</i>


1449
01:26:39.512 --> 01:26:43.766
<i>And so, at any time, the balance</i>
<i>of the Court can change.</i>


1450
01:26:44.434 --> 01:26:47.020
And the decision may be different
next time.


1451
01:26:53.192 --> 01:26:56.362
<i>The Supreme Court decision in Hellerstedt</i>

1452
01:26:56.446 --> 01:27:00.575
motivated pro-life people,
reinforced, once again,


1453
01:27:01.242 --> 01:27:04.787
that if we want to change the laws,
we have to change the Supreme Court.


1454
01:27:07.040 --> 01:27:11.169
<i>Donald Trump meeting privately</i>
<i>in New York with leading evangelicals.</i>


1455
01:27:11.377 --> 01:27:14.922
Donald Trump came and had a conversation.
Now we don't agree on everything.


1456
01:27:15.131 --> 01:27:18.051
I've been working on national elections
for a number of years


1457
01:27:18.134 --> 01:27:20.136
and there's always been an effort

1458
01:27:20.303 --> 01:27:23.222
to try to consolidate
conservative evangelicals.


1459
01:27:23.389 --> 01:27:26.392
<i>It is a critical voting block</i>
<i>for any Republican candidate.</i>


1460
01:27:26.517 --> 01:27:32.065
<i>To win in November, Donald Trump needs</i>
<i>75, maybe even 80 percent of evangelicals.</i>


1461
01:27:32.398 --> 01:27:34.192
<i>Our goals are very simple.</i>

1462
01:27:34.484 --> 01:27:38.905
It is to advance faith in public policy
and in our culture as a whole,


1463
01:27:38.988 --> 01:27:42.742
from a Christian world view.
We are unapologetically Christian.


1464
01:27:42.825 --> 01:27:46.871
Evangelicals have been under constant
attack by the Obama administration.


1465
01:27:47.121 --> 01:27:48.623
And quite frankly, they're tired of it.

1466
01:27:49.207 --> 01:27:53.711
<i>And under Barack Obama,</i>
<i>this heavy hand of government tried</i>


1467
01:27:53.795 --> 01:27:58.424
<i>to force society to accept things like</i>
<i>abortion and the redefinition of marriage.</i>


1468
01:27:59.050 --> 01:28:01.052
These things run counter to nature.

1469
01:28:01.469 --> 01:28:05.640
They run counter to the moral law of God.
And so what you saw is pushback.


1470
01:28:06.391 --> 01:28:09.685
Obviously, there's not many choices here.
The choice is between Hillary Clinton,


1471
01:28:09.852 --> 01:28:12.146
and we know exactly
what she will provide to America.


1472
01:28:12.647 --> 01:28:13.940
Or we have Donald Trump.

1473
01:28:15.358 --> 01:28:17.860
<i>He's considered</i>
<i>the least religious of the candidates.</i>


1474
01:28:17.944 --> 01:28:20.947
<i>If Ivanka weren't my daughter,</i>
<i>perhaps I'd be dating her.</i>


1475
01:28:21.239 --> 01:28:24.742
<i>You know about</i>
<i>sexual predators and things like that.</i>


1476
01:28:24.867 --> 01:28:27.620
- <i>You are one!</i>
<i>- All right, wasn't gonna say that.</i>


1477
01:28:27.703 --> 01:28:30.790
I'm very pro-choice.
I just believe in choice.


1478
01:28:30.873 --> 01:28:33.334
<i>Evangelical Christians</i>
<i>aren't fully onboard yet.</i>


1479
01:28:33.418 --> 01:28:35.753
Some say they may sit home come November.

1480
01:28:36.254 --> 01:28:38.381
<i>You cannot ignore</i>
<i>this constituency.</i>


1481
01:28:38.756 --> 01:28:41.926
But remember,
George H.W. Bush was pro-choice,


1482
01:28:42.135 --> 01:28:43.261
<i>became pro-life.</i>

1483
01:28:43.344 --> 01:28:46.597
Mr. Bush has something to think about.

1484
01:28:46.681 --> 01:28:48.933
Human life is precious, born or unborn.

1485
01:28:49.350 --> 01:28:53.980
Ronald Reagan signed the most liberal
abortion law in America in the late '60s,


1486
01:28:54.063 --> 01:28:56.816
and was a pro-life hero by 1980.

1487
01:28:56.899 --> 01:28:59.694
I think when you interrupt the pregnancy,
you're taking a human life.


1488
01:28:59.777 --> 01:29:03.906
So all Donald Trump has to do is,
as those prior nominees did,


1489
01:29:04.532 --> 01:29:05.533
make it clear.

1490
01:29:05.616 --> 01:29:09.203
We came together in a national crusade
to make America great again.


1491
01:29:09.871 --> 01:29:12.623
-And to make a new beginning.
-Make it clear.


1492
01:29:12.707 --> 01:29:14.459
"I changed my views."

1493
01:29:16.043 --> 01:29:20.298
The justices that I'm going to appoint
will be pro-life.


1494
01:29:21.215 --> 01:29:25.219
The pro-life constituency is absolutely
essential for a Republican victory.


1495
01:29:25.344 --> 01:29:26.804
Donald J. Trump.

1496
01:29:28.931 --> 01:29:32.101
Make it clear that if he becomes
president, he'll fight for those things.


1497
01:29:32.768 --> 01:29:34.937
It's not only about Roe v Wade.

1498
01:29:35.021 --> 01:29:37.982
It is about what's happening right now
in America.


1499
01:29:38.357 --> 01:29:40.985
So many states are putting

1500
01:29:41.486 --> 01:29:45.072
very stringent regulations on women that

1501
01:29:45.406 --> 01:29:48.075
block them from exercising
that choice...


1502
01:29:48.659 --> 01:29:52.455
<i>I believe what sold the pro-life</i>
<i>community on Donald Trump</i>


1503
01:29:52.538 --> 01:29:55.208
<i>was the final debate in Las Vegas.</i>

1504
01:29:55.500 --> 01:30:00.087
I will defend Roe v. Wade,
and I will defend women's rights to make


1505
01:30:00.213 --> 01:30:02.215
their own health care decisions.

1506
01:30:02.298 --> 01:30:04.884
<i>I was in the audience.</i>
<i>I was watching him.</i> ...which divides you--
a woman's right to abortion?


1507
01:30:07.720 --> 01:30:11.641
And when he went into a discussion

1508
01:30:11.724 --> 01:30:13.768
of partial-birth abortion,
late-term abortion...


1509
01:30:13.851 --> 01:30:19.023
If you go with what Hillary is saying,
in the ninth month, you can take the baby


1510
01:30:19.106 --> 01:30:22.401
and rip the baby out of the womb
of the mother. ...I knew those were Donald Trump's words.


1511
01:30:26.656 --> 01:30:29.200
Now, you can say that that's okay.

1512
01:30:29.325 --> 01:30:31.911
<i>Those were not the words</i>
<i>of some speechwriter.</i>


1513
01:30:31.994 --> 01:30:33.162
It's not okay with me.

1514
01:30:33.663 --> 01:30:35.957
Because based on what she's saying...

1515
01:30:36.040 --> 01:30:38.543
<i>It was clearly Trump speaking</i>
<i>at that moment.</i>


1516
01:30:38.668 --> 01:30:43.172
You can take the baby and rip the baby
out of the womb, in the ninth month,


1517
01:30:43.756 --> 01:30:46.759
on the final day!
And that's not acceptable.


1518
01:30:46.842 --> 01:30:48.261
<i>And when he did that,</i>

1519
01:30:48.719 --> 01:30:52.723
I believe he sealed the deal
with pro-lifers across the country.


1520
01:30:55.268 --> 01:30:57.478
And will,
to the best of my ability,


1521
01:30:57.812 --> 01:31:00.147
...preserve, protect, and defend...

1522
01:31:00.314 --> 01:31:02.233
...preserve, protect,
and defend...


1523
01:31:02.358 --> 01:31:04.527
...the Constitution of the United States.

1524
01:31:04.610 --> 01:31:06.904
...the Constitution of the United States.

1525
01:31:07.071 --> 01:31:09.031
-So help me God.
-So help me God.


1526
01:31:09.407 --> 01:31:11.492
Congratulations, Mr. President.

1527
01:31:42.106 --> 01:31:43.733
<i>When I became a physician,</i>

1528
01:31:43.816 --> 01:31:47.153
<i>the oath that I took was that I was gonna</i>
<i>provide the best medical care</i>


1529
01:31:47.653 --> 01:31:49.196
<i>for all patients who needed it.</i>

1530
01:31:55.202 --> 01:31:57.538
<i>And patients need access to abortions.</i>

1531
01:31:59.248 --> 01:32:02.418
<i>And they need care delivered to them</i>
<i>with dignity and respect.</i>


1532
01:32:08.799 --> 01:32:09.884
All right, you ready?

1533
01:32:10.760 --> 01:32:14.805
<i>So if that means getting on planes</i>
<i>or driving hundreds of miles,</i>


1534
01:32:15.431 --> 01:32:18.601
<i>I'm going to continue to do that,</i>
<i>because that's what's needed right now.</i>


1535
01:32:22.855 --> 01:32:24.732
<i>Women have built their lives</i>

1536
01:32:24.815 --> 01:32:28.235
<i>around the ability to make decisions</i>
<i>about pregnancy.</i>


1537
01:32:31.572 --> 01:32:35.701
So, we have to make sure
that their right is protected.


1538
01:32:38.329 --> 01:32:40.331
<i>And we have to remain vigilant.</i>

1539
01:32:40.539 --> 01:32:44.585
<i>Because there is a very real concern</i>
<i>that the Trump administration is going</i>


1540
01:32:44.710 --> 01:32:46.295
<i>to appoint anti-abortion judges.</i>

1541
01:32:46.629 --> 01:32:49.548
<i>President Trump announced</i>
<i>nearly a dozen new nominees</i>


1542
01:32:49.632 --> 01:32:51.342
<i>for the lower federal courts.</i>

1543
01:32:51.550 --> 01:32:54.679
<i>Hundreds of seats are going</i>
<i>to be filled by this administration</i>


1544
01:32:54.762 --> 01:32:56.138
<i>thoughout the judicial system.</i>

1545
01:32:56.222 --> 01:32:59.475
<i>These people will be serving</i>
<i>for the rest of their lives.</i>


1546
01:32:59.558 --> 01:33:02.436
It's life term. It's generations
of impact on American law.


1547
01:33:02.770 --> 01:33:05.022
<i>The Court of Appeals,</i>
<i>circuit judges...</i>


1548
01:33:05.523 --> 01:33:06.774
whether it be district judges...

1549
01:33:07.358 --> 01:33:09.735
<i>When you really think about</i>
<i>the way we're going,</i>


1550
01:33:09.902 --> 01:33:12.780
<i>years from now, picking good judges</i>
<i>even at the district level</i>


1551
01:33:12.863 --> 01:33:16.701
is extremely important.
And that's how we're going to finish this


1552
01:33:16.867 --> 01:33:18.285
to overtun Roe vs. Wade.

1553
01:33:19.120 --> 01:33:21.122
<i>Today I am keeping</i>
<i>another promise,</i>


1554
01:33:22.039 --> 01:33:25.376
by nominating Judge Neil Gorsuch

1555
01:33:25.459 --> 01:33:28.129
<i>to the United States Supreme Court.</i>

1556
01:33:28.212 --> 01:33:31.257
<i>We're putting out strong</i>
<i>pro-life bills and so, eventually,</i>


1557
01:33:31.340 --> 01:33:33.968
<i>the Supreme Court will weigh in</i>
<i>on the issue.</i>


1558
01:33:35.386 --> 01:33:37.471
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>how long it will take</i>


1559
01:33:37.555 --> 01:33:40.391
to overturn Roe v. Wade,
or when it will be overturned.


1560
01:33:40.933 --> 01:33:42.727
I have no doubt it will be.

1561
01:33:44.770 --> 01:33:47.064
All across the nation,

1562
01:33:47.440 --> 01:33:50.943
life is winning again in America.

1563
01:33:55.197 --> 01:33:57.491
<i>In a monumental moment</i>
<i>for the Supreme Court,</i>


1564
01:33:57.575 --> 01:34:00.244
<i>Justice Anthony Kennedy is retiring</i>
<i>from the Court.</i>


1565
01:34:00.327 --> 01:34:02.705
<i>The crucial swing vote</i>
<i>is now stepping down</i>


1566
01:34:02.788 --> 01:34:06.292
<i>and President Trump will get the chance</i>
<i>to shape this Court for a generation.</i>


1567
01:34:06.792 --> 01:34:10.212
<i>This is an opportunity to restore</i>
<i>a culture of life in this country.</i>


1568
01:34:10.296 --> 01:34:12.465
This is a historic moment.

1569
01:34:12.798 --> 01:34:14.884
And we have a chance
to take down Roe v. Wade.


1570
01:34:15.468 --> 01:34:17.970
<i>I think this supercharges</i>
<i>the president's base.</i>


1571
01:34:18.053 --> 01:34:20.431
<i>Seven out of ten of his evangelical voters</i>

1572
01:34:20.514 --> 01:34:23.142
<i>said that the Supreme Court has</i>
<i>an effect on their daily lives.</i>


1573
01:34:23.225 --> 01:34:26.812
And I think he should put forth
a candidate that is above reproach


1574
01:34:26.896 --> 01:34:29.106
on this issue of the sanctity
of human life.


1575
01:34:29.190 --> 01:34:31.066
And I think Roe can be overturned.

1576
01:34:31.984 --> 01:34:35.154
I do believe it could be overturned
and I think it goes back to the states.


1577
01:34:35.237 --> 01:34:39.074
And I think that the states will decide
what policies to handle. And I think...


1578
01:34:39.700 --> 01:34:42.411
we will be
a predominantly pro-life nation.


1579
01:34:43.204 --> 01:34:45.748
You're gonna see 20 states

1580
01:34:46.665 --> 01:34:49.335
pass laws banning abortion outright.

1581
01:34:49.418 --> 01:34:50.711
<i>Because they know</i>

1582
01:34:50.795 --> 01:34:53.714

<i>five votes on the Supreme Court</i>


1583
01:34:53.798 --> 01:34:55.382
<i>to overturn Roe v. Wade.</i>

1584
01:34:55.841 --> 01:34:58.469
<i>If Roe v. Wade is overturned</i>

1585
01:34:58.552 --> 01:35:01.222
we will see some states that will say
abortion is not allowed,


1586
01:35:01.806 --> 01:35:04.058
there will be some states
that are going to...


1587
01:35:04.600 --> 01:35:07.603
probably not place many limits
on abortion at all,

We will keep working


1589
01:35:11.899 --> 01:35:13.651

1591
01:35:26.330 --> 01:35:28.499

1592
01:35:30.167 --> 01:35:32.670

1593
01:35:33.420 --> 01:35:35.881
