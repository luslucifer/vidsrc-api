00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.185
<i>Let's take this video
to the Idaho side of the Park.</i>


2
00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.621
<i>But to get to Idaho,
you go out the west entrance.</i>


3
00:01:27.623 --> 00:01:28.922
<i>The west entrance?
Okay.</i>


4
00:01:28.924 --> 00:01:30.391
Is that the region where, um...

5
00:01:30.794 --> 00:01:32.894
Have you heard of this
constitutional loophole thing?


6
00:01:32.995 --> 00:01:34.561
Is that the region where that is?

7
00:01:34.563 --> 00:01:36.496
Constitutional loophole?
I'm not following that.


8
00:01:36.498 --> 00:01:38.098
You never read any
articles about that stuff?


9
00:01:38.767 --> 00:01:39.934
- No.
- Okay.


10
00:01:40.702 --> 00:01:41.401
Thanks a lot.

11
00:01:42.503 --> 00:01:43.836
- Here you go.
- Thank you.


12
00:01:43.838 --> 00:01:45.137
- Have a great day.
- I will.


13
00:01:48.042 --> 00:01:49.676
Knows nothing.

14
00:01:49.678 --> 00:01:50.911
No one knows anything.

15
00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.859
<i>Yellowstone National Park.</i>

16
00:02:05.861 --> 00:02:07.561
<i>Around every corner is a reminder</i>

17
00:02:07.563 --> 00:02:08.862
<i>of how still life can be.</i>

18
00:02:10.631 --> 00:02:12.065
<i>How vast it can be.</i>

19
00:02:14.202 --> 00:02:15.402
<i>How true it can be.</i>

20
00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:18.239
<i>Until it isn't.</i>

21
00:02:21.742 --> 00:02:22.741
<i>Yellowstone woke up</i>

22
00:02:22.743 --> 00:02:24.144
<i>to what has to be
the worst crime</i>


23
00:02:24.146 --> 00:02:25.979
<i>in the National Park's history.</i>

24
00:02:26.813 --> 00:02:28.047
<i>A bizarre triple homicide,</i>

25
00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:29.347
<i>where the murderer immediately</i>

26
00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:31.383
<i>turned himself in and confessed.</i>

27
00:02:31.853 --> 00:02:33.286
<i>First victim was by the fire.</i>

28
00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.757
The second one, I don't know,
maybe 10 feet from it.


29
00:02:42.029 --> 00:02:44.163
This is where
the third victim was shot.


30
00:02:44.165 --> 00:02:45.598
- Okay.
- By the back wheel?


31
00:02:49.136 --> 00:02:50.534
<i>I just really can't understand</i>

32
00:02:50.536 --> 00:02:54.038
<i>how a man can commit
all these horrific crimes, you know,</i>


33
00:02:54.041 --> 00:02:55.041
<i>and then just...</i>

34
00:02:55.142 --> 00:02:56.742
<i>Talk about it like he's</i>

35
00:02:56.744 --> 00:02:58.677
reciting the details
of a traffic violation.


36
00:03:01.015 --> 00:03:03.750
<i>Nobody could have expected</i>

37
00:03:03.751 --> 00:03:06.586
the side swipe that occurred.

38
00:03:07.288 --> 00:03:10.122
<i>We're talking about
a confessed murderer here.</i>


39
00:03:10.123 --> 00:03:12.891
<i>One who showed no remorse,
no regret.</i>


40
00:03:12.894 --> 00:03:14.793
This guy should have been
put away for life.


41
00:03:17.998 --> 00:03:19.197
<i>There is no resolution.</i>

42
00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:21.634
<i>I mean, it's just this thing
hanging over us.</i>


43
00:03:22.137 --> 00:03:23.870
<i>I think most of the country,
most of the world,</i>


44
00:03:23.872 --> 00:03:25.238
<i>hasn't even heard of this.</i>

45
00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:27.106
Well, this whole thing
was swept under the rug.


46
00:03:28.141 --> 00:03:29.275
It's an embarrassment.

47
00:03:42.821 --> 00:03:44.389
<i>My name is Julian Pinder.</i>

48
00:03:44.693 --> 00:03:46.091
<i>As a documentary film-maker,</i>

49
00:03:46.093 --> 00:03:48.061
<i>I believe anything in life
can be fascinating</i>


50
00:03:48.062 --> 00:03:49.663
<i>when you delve into the details.</i>

51
00:03:50.666 --> 00:03:53.567
<i>I find characters and I
tell a story through them.</i>


52
00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:56.603
<i>Their words, their actions, their eyes.</i>

53
00:03:57.104 --> 00:03:58.904
<i>But it's a completely different story</i>

54
00:03:58.906 --> 00:04:00.239
<i>when the camera turns on you.</i>

55
00:04:00.244 --> 00:04:01.176
It's nice.

56
00:04:02.711 --> 00:04:03.778
How's that?

57
00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:09.148
<i>I first heard of this story</i>

58
00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.919
<i>when I received an email
not too long ago.</i>


59
00:04:12.954 --> 00:04:14.153
<i>Three boys were murdered</i>

60
00:04:14.155 --> 00:04:17.323
<i>in a remote part of
Yellowstone National Park.</i>


61
00:04:18.193 --> 00:04:20.795
<i>What struck me was
that the murders took place</i>


62
00:04:20.797 --> 00:04:23.565
<i>on April 27th, 2009,</i>

63
00:04:24.067 --> 00:04:25.299
<i>nearly five years ago.</i>

64
00:04:26.701 --> 00:04:28.201
<i>Why was I being sent this now?</i>

65
00:04:32.206 --> 00:04:36.877
<i>The email came from
chasingbisonbear@gmail.com.</i>


66
00:04:37.679 --> 00:04:40.447
<i>I was unsuccessful in contacting
the source of the email.</i>


67
00:04:41.114 --> 00:04:42.815
<i>But when I did a search,</i>

68
00:04:42.817 --> 00:04:45.718
<i>incredible images immediately surfaced</i>

69
00:04:45.721 --> 00:04:48.088
<i>of a bear chasing a burnt bison</i>

70
00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.624
<i>down a winter road in Yellowstone.</i>

71
00:04:50.627 --> 00:04:53.294
<i>Incredible and unbelievable.</i>

72
00:04:53.296 --> 00:04:55.329
<i>A chase like none other
seen before.</i>


73
00:04:57.732 --> 00:05:00.266
<i>These images would
prove to be a metaphor</i>


74
00:05:01.103 --> 00:05:03.137
<i>for the Yellowstone murders.</i>

75
00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:11.810
<i>David Drabeck,
Thomas Burnett and Cody Gibbs</i>


76
00:05:11.812 --> 00:05:13.846
<i>were camping in
Yellowstone National Park,</i>


77
00:05:13.848 --> 00:05:14.846
<i>when tragedy struck.</i>

78
00:05:14.848 --> 00:05:17.850
<i>A chance encounter
with a stranger proved fatal</i>


79
00:05:17.852 --> 00:05:20.085
<i>when Williston resident,
Dwayne Nelson,</i>


80
00:05:20.088 --> 00:05:21.188
<i>killed the young men</i>

81
00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:23.556
<i>in a self-described
moment of insanity.</i>


82
00:05:23.658 --> 00:05:24.858
<i>Shocking news of
a three person homicide</i>


83
00:05:24.859 --> 00:05:25.757
<i>early this morning.</i>

84
00:05:26.059 --> 00:05:27.226
<i>The suspect turned himself in</i>

85
00:05:27.228 --> 00:05:28.994
<i>just after 5:30 am.</i>

86
00:05:28.996 --> 00:05:30.763
<i>In what has to be
the worst crime</i>


87
00:05:30.766 --> 00:05:32.032
<i>in the National Park's history.</i>

88
00:05:33.266 --> 00:05:34.299
I was here,

89
00:05:35.402 --> 00:05:38.237
and I received a phone call.

90
00:05:39.138 --> 00:05:41.973
It was our family doctor.

91
00:05:42.275 --> 00:05:44.942
<i>There was
an emergency contact thing</i>


92
00:05:44.945 --> 00:05:46.245
<i>in Thomas' wallet.</i>

93
00:05:46.247 --> 00:05:47.445
<i>It was the middle of the night.</i>

94
00:05:47.447 --> 00:05:49.114
<i>I didn't know why
I was getting a call.</i>


95
00:05:50.016 --> 00:05:53.386
I... I dropped to that floor.

96
00:05:53.988 --> 00:05:57.156
And I didn't think I was
ever going to get up again.


97
00:05:58.758 --> 00:06:00.859
First thing was...

98
00:06:02.328 --> 00:06:03.328
Was violence.

99
00:06:04.297 --> 00:06:05.431
Because, uh...

100
00:06:06.666 --> 00:06:07.900
<i>I heard that someone shot him...</i>

101
00:06:09.368 --> 00:06:10.368
<i>In the back.</i>

102
00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:13.471
<i>And I... was angry.
I was very angry.</i>


103
00:06:14.841 --> 00:06:16.375
It took a while for

104
00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:18.810
grief to set in.

105
00:06:20.045 --> 00:06:20.944
I didn't believe it.

106
00:06:23.249 --> 00:06:24.349
I thought they'd made a mistake,

107
00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:25.416
came to the wrong house,

108
00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:27.752
<i>had the wrong boy.</i>

109
00:06:28.054 --> 00:06:28.952
<i>I didn't believe it.</i>

110
00:06:28.954 --> 00:06:31.589
<i>I didn't believe it
till I actually saw his body.</i>


111
00:06:37.796 --> 00:06:39.998
<i>On that day I can remember
pretty much everything.</i>


112
00:06:40.499 --> 00:06:43.233
<i>I remember the colour of the sky,</i>

113
00:06:43.235 --> 00:06:44.968
<i>the calmness in the air.</i>

114
00:06:46.337 --> 00:06:48.739
I was just here at my post.

115
00:06:48.742 --> 00:06:50.775
This particular ranger station, um,

116
00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:54.212
is the furthest south-west

117
00:06:54.414 --> 00:06:56.047
that you can get to by vehicle

118
00:06:56.149 --> 00:06:57.549
in Yellowstone.

119
00:06:58.251 --> 00:07:01.152
<i>It was just after 5:30
in the morning.</i>


120
00:07:02.521 --> 00:07:04.422
<i>I'd just made myself
a cup of coffee.</i>


121
00:07:05.891 --> 00:07:07.325
<i>He walked out of the woods,</i>

122
00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:10.927
<i>the West Side, the entrance side.</i>

123
00:07:11.829 --> 00:07:12.829
<i>He left the weapon</i>

124
00:07:13.431 --> 00:07:14.431
outside of the door,

125
00:07:14.434 --> 00:07:16.134
and just walked in.

126
00:07:18.437 --> 00:07:19.336
<i>The way it happened,</i>

127
00:07:19.338 --> 00:07:21.705
<i>you'd think there would
have been some emotion.</i>


128
00:07:23.407 --> 00:07:24.908
But like I said before,

129
00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:27.811
he seemed so calm and, uh...

130
00:07:29.114 --> 00:07:30.114
<i>So normal.</i>

131
00:07:32.885 --> 00:07:33.818
Right here.

132
00:07:36.421 --> 00:07:37.355
This way.

133
00:07:40.491 --> 00:07:42.492
It was right in here
that they parked the truck.


134
00:07:44.329 --> 00:07:46.030
This is where
the third victim was shot,


135
00:07:46.031 --> 00:07:47.464
- by the back wheel.
- Okay.


136
00:07:48.834 --> 00:07:50.034
<i>It's a bit of a clearing here.</i>

137
00:07:53.204 --> 00:07:54.504
And this is where the fire pit

138
00:07:55.373 --> 00:07:57.073
was set up.

139
00:07:57.076 --> 00:07:57.874
Right around here.

140
00:07:57.876 --> 00:08:00.078
This is where the other two
victims were found.


141
00:08:00.381 --> 00:08:01.880
First victim was by the fire,

142
00:08:03.448 --> 00:08:04.582
and the second one,

143
00:08:04.584 --> 00:08:06.984
I don't know,
maybe ten feet from it.


144
00:08:06.986 --> 00:08:08.252
Never stood much of a chance.

145
00:08:18.963 --> 00:08:20.197
The families...

146
00:08:21.065 --> 00:08:22.232
Come and visit them.

147
00:08:23.266 --> 00:08:24.533
They bring flowers and stuff.

148
00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:31.374
<i>But he just wanted
to be outside, all the time.</i>


149
00:08:31.376 --> 00:08:33.476
I mean, he's the guy that
organised all those trips,


150
00:08:33.478 --> 00:08:34.478
every year.

151
00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:36.279
<i>Even when they weren't around,
he'd grab his knapsack</i>


152
00:08:36.281 --> 00:08:37.481
<i>and be gone.</i>

153
00:08:38.082 --> 00:08:39.315
<i>Go off hiking by himself.</i>

154
00:08:39.317 --> 00:08:39.915
<i>He just...</i>

155
00:08:39.917 --> 00:08:42.018
<i>I don't know what
it was about him.</i>


156
00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:44.520
<i>I guess he found
something in nature that...</i>


157
00:08:45.589 --> 00:08:47.122
<i>That put him at peace,
I don't know.</i>


158
00:08:47.125 --> 00:08:48.458
<i>But he loved it.</i>

159
00:08:49.627 --> 00:08:53.264
This is, uh, Thomas and Alicia.

160
00:08:53.965 --> 00:08:55.297
- Great looking couple.
- Yeah.


161
00:08:55.299 --> 00:08:57.566
And Thomas on his wedding day.

162
00:08:57.568 --> 00:08:59.001
That's a great shot.

163
00:08:59.003 --> 00:09:01.570
And another one of
Thomas and Alicia.


164
00:09:01.573 --> 00:09:03.874
This one over here, this is, uh...

165
00:09:03.876 --> 00:09:05.542
This is all the boys together.

166
00:09:05.544 --> 00:09:07.077
Thomas, Cody and David.

167
00:09:08.545 --> 00:09:10.446
Oh, you know.
I'll show you this, actually.


168
00:09:11.948 --> 00:09:13.282
Here's...

169
00:09:15.988 --> 00:09:17.989
I took that on the morning
that they left.


170
00:09:19.591 --> 00:09:21.392
They did that trip every year.

171
00:09:21.394 --> 00:09:23.527
Well, David didn't actually
join them until


172
00:09:23.528 --> 00:09:24.527
the third year.

173
00:09:24.529 --> 00:09:26.062
But, uh...

174
00:09:26.064 --> 00:09:27.964
This was their...
This was their fifth year


175
00:09:28.466 --> 00:09:30.333
doing the trip.

176
00:09:30.335 --> 00:09:33.169
You know, they'd all come
over here in the morning,


177
00:09:33.172 --> 00:09:34.639
and they'd have breakfast, and...

178
00:09:36.575 --> 00:09:38.242
And then they'd leave.

179
00:09:38.243 --> 00:09:40.243
Thomas, he was the one
with the pickup truck. So...


180
00:09:41.445 --> 00:09:42.412
And that's that.

181
00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:53.524
Sorry.

182
00:09:53.525 --> 00:09:54.691
It's all right.

183
00:09:58.195 --> 00:09:59.362
Okay.

184
00:09:59.365 --> 00:10:02.233
<i>I built a business that I...</i>

185
00:10:03.201 --> 00:10:05.036
<i>Wanted to leave to him.</i>

186
00:10:05.038 --> 00:10:07.939
<i>You know, I respect what he
did and what he loved,</i>


187
00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:11.474
<i>but I thought at some point
he's gotta grow up and accept</i>


188
00:10:12.176 --> 00:10:14.144
<i>who he is and...</i>

189
00:10:15.513 --> 00:10:17.314
<i>You know?</i>

190
00:10:17.316 --> 00:10:18.615
At least make a life for himself.

191
00:10:18.617 --> 00:10:19.683
Make a career for himself.

192
00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:26.689
- Drive safe.
- Will do. Bye.


193
00:10:26.691 --> 00:10:28.724
- Love you, mom.
- Bye.


194
00:10:28.726 --> 00:10:30.059
<i>He was going off to...</i>

195
00:10:31.094 --> 00:10:33.629
Yellowstone the umpteenth time,

196
00:10:33.631 --> 00:10:35.364
and it was just...

197
00:10:35.367 --> 00:10:36.865
He was on my last nerve that day.

198
00:10:36.867 --> 00:10:39.302
<i>We'd had a little spat
at dinner the night before,</i>


199
00:10:39.303 --> 00:10:40.836
<i>and then he go... traipse off
to the...</i>


200
00:10:42.005 --> 00:10:44.139
<i>To the Park,
and I just, you know...</i>


201
00:10:44.141 --> 00:10:45.139
<i>The last thing I said</i>

202
00:10:45.141 --> 00:10:48.510
was just, you know,
"good luck finding a career.


203
00:10:48.646 --> 00:10:50.513
In the woods."

204
00:10:50.515 --> 00:10:52.148
Or whatever I said. It just...

205
00:10:55.385 --> 00:10:56.686
<i>There are only four people</i>

206
00:10:56.688 --> 00:10:58.420
<i>who truly know what
happened that night.</i>


207
00:11:00.757 --> 00:11:02.591
<i>Three of them are dead.</i>

208
00:11:02.593 --> 00:11:04.326
<i>The only eye witness account</i>

209
00:11:04.328 --> 00:11:06.161
<i>comes from Dwayne Nelson,</i>

210
00:11:06.163 --> 00:11:07.529
<i>the man who pulled the trigger.</i>

211
00:11:09.065 --> 00:11:11.066
You know, once the suspect is talking,

212
00:11:12.268 --> 00:11:13.167
they don't shut up.

213
00:11:13.169 --> 00:11:15.337
<i>It's like they need to get it out.</i>

214
00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:17.040
<i>But let me tell you something.</i>

215
00:11:18.142 --> 00:11:19.476
<i>With Dwayne,</i>

216
00:11:19.478 --> 00:11:20.543
<i>he gave us everything.</i>

217
00:11:21.345 --> 00:11:23.313
It was almost like the...

218
00:11:23.314 --> 00:11:24.413
It was rehearsed.

219
00:15:21.283 --> 00:15:23.551
<i>I'm standing outside
the Cheyenne Police Station,</i>


220
00:15:23.553 --> 00:15:25.920
<i>where Dwayne Nelson will
soon be moved to the Courthouse</i>


221
00:15:25.922 --> 00:15:27.622
<i>to attend a preliminary hearing</i>

222
00:15:27.624 --> 00:15:30.858
<i>in a case that is being dubbed
"the Yellowstone murders."</i>


223
00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:32.426
<i>A bizarre triple homicide,</i>

224
00:15:32.528 --> 00:15:33.626
<i>where the murderer immediately</i>

225
00:15:33.628 --> 00:15:35.429
<i>turned himself in and confessed.</i>

226
00:15:36.831 --> 00:15:38.598
I just really can't understand

227
00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:41.435
how a man could commit all these
horrific crimes, you know.


228
00:15:41.738 --> 00:15:44.939
And then just talk about it
like he's, uh...


229
00:15:44.941 --> 00:15:47.408
Reciting the details of
a traffic violation.


230
00:15:58.753 --> 00:16:01.488
<i>If you could say
something to Dwayne Nelson,</i>


231
00:16:02.891 --> 00:16:05.326
<i>and you had that opportunity,
what would you say to him?</i>


232
00:16:07.295 --> 00:16:08.662
<i>If I could say anything</i>

233
00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:10.397
<i>to Dwayne,</i>

234
00:16:11.866 --> 00:16:13.933
I would say that I
want my son back.


235
00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:17.971
<i>I would say that
I want Cody back.</i>


236
00:16:18.606 --> 00:16:20.207
Out of the way.

237
00:16:20.908 --> 00:16:22.474
<i>He's never offered
me an apology.</i>


238
00:16:22.477 --> 00:16:26.012
<i>He's never taken any
responsibility for his actions.</i>


239
00:16:26.014 --> 00:16:27.180
<i>What will I have to say to him?</i>

240
00:16:27.847 --> 00:16:29.081
Nothing.

241
00:16:38.958 --> 00:16:40.526
We're live now.

242
00:16:40.529 --> 00:16:43.863
He will pay for the murders
of these boys.


243
00:16:44.965 --> 00:16:46.833
And he will understand
what it feels like


244
00:16:46.835 --> 00:16:48.668
to have something
taken away from you.


245
00:16:50.403 --> 00:16:51.837
<i>If I could even just...</i>

246
00:16:52.872 --> 00:16:54.506
Understand why

247
00:16:55.543 --> 00:16:57.744
this person did this,

248
00:16:58.611 --> 00:17:00.112
then I could maybe

249
00:17:00.115 --> 00:17:02.449
move better to forgiveness, but...

250
00:17:02.451 --> 00:17:03.917
Because it's just so...

251
00:17:04.784 --> 00:17:07.619
Senseless and random.

252
00:17:09.689 --> 00:17:11.824
It shook my faith
for a very long time.


253
00:17:17.964 --> 00:17:19.765
<i>Cheyenne Police
spent three months</i>


254
00:17:19.766 --> 00:17:20.898
<i>looking for a motive.</i>

255
00:17:21.734 --> 00:17:23.102
<i>They found none.</i>

256
00:17:24.404 --> 00:17:27.004
<i>With Dwayne's confession,
they were certain  of a conviction.</i>


257
00:17:33.813 --> 00:17:35.881
<i>There were still questions
that needed answering.</i>


258
00:17:37.483 --> 00:17:38.682
<i>I cancelled my flight home</i>

259
00:17:38.684 --> 00:17:40.251
<i>and headed to
Cheyenne, Wyoming,</i>


260
00:17:40.654 --> 00:17:42.688
<i>where the hearing
took place years ago.</i>


261
00:17:55.167 --> 00:17:57.402
<i>I think the only
regret I have is...</i>


262
00:17:58.570 --> 00:17:59.570
<i>Is maybe the, uh...</i>

263
00:18:01.708 --> 00:18:03.409
The over-confidence that we were...

264
00:18:04.476 --> 00:18:06.944
That it was a done thing.

265
00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:08.813
A surefire

266
00:18:09.748 --> 00:18:10.948
win for us.

267
00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:11.949
But I, uh...

268
00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:16.521
I honestly didn't think
that it would go through.


269
00:18:18.624 --> 00:18:21.192
<i>I wouldn't call it arrogant,
but certainly,</i>


270
00:18:21.193 --> 00:18:23.427
<i>it seemed like an easy case to me.</i>

271
00:18:23.429 --> 00:18:24.995
You wanna take
your feelings out of it,


272
00:18:24.997 --> 00:18:27.798
but we're talking about
a confessed murderer here.


273
00:18:27.799 --> 00:18:30.199
One who showed
no remorse, no regret.


274
00:18:30.203 --> 00:18:31.804
<i>We had murder weapon.</i>

275
00:18:33.106 --> 00:18:34.205
<i>We had fingerprints.</i>

276
00:18:34.972 --> 00:18:35.871
<i>Security footage,</i>

277
00:18:35.873 --> 00:18:38.208
<i>and a population
screaming for justice.</i>


278
00:18:38.611 --> 00:18:40.545
<i>And who wanted him
put away for life.</i>


279
00:18:40.547 --> 00:18:42.814
<i>And at that time, there was</i>

280
00:18:42.815 --> 00:18:45.515
<i>no doubt in my mind we were
gonna do just that.</i>


281
00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:52.056
<i>The fact that I got the Nelson
case was a surprise.</i>


282
00:18:52.057 --> 00:18:53.289
<i>My first, uh...</i>

283
00:18:53.558 --> 00:18:55.158
<i>Murder trial.</i>

284
00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:58.028
And I knew it was
gonna be a big deal.


285
00:18:58.962 --> 00:18:59.929
Uh...

286
00:19:00.899 --> 00:19:03.034
And it was a big deal.

287
00:19:04.168 --> 00:19:05.802
Dwayne's case was very unique.

288
00:19:06.537 --> 00:19:07.704
Okay?

289
00:19:09.708 --> 00:19:11.509
What you had here was

290
00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:12.742
a classic plea pardon case.

291
00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:17.248
There was no logic
to his motivation.


292
00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:18.182
Absolutely none.

293
00:19:19.917 --> 00:19:23.153
Which set it up
for an insanity plea.


294
00:19:23.155 --> 00:19:25.755
I wanted to change
the location of the trial.


295
00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:28.224
I wanted to, uh...

296
00:19:28.626 --> 00:19:30.125
Make sure that we had
an impartial jury.


297
00:19:30.128 --> 00:19:31.528
He wouldn't stand for it.

298
00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:33.663
The loophole was brought up to me

299
00:19:33.666 --> 00:19:36.100
almost exactly 24 hours
before we went to the hearing.


300
00:19:39.805 --> 00:19:41.406
So we looked at it.
We looked at it,


301
00:19:41.407 --> 00:19:43.173
we danced around it,
it was a conversation.


302
00:19:44.242 --> 00:19:45.742
And, uh...

303
00:19:45.745 --> 00:19:47.612
And then we looked into
the legalities of it.


304
00:19:49.649 --> 00:19:50.749
Then we ran with it.

305
00:19:52.552 --> 00:19:54.186
<i>Will the defendant please rise.</i>

306
00:19:55.188 --> 00:19:57.623
<i>Based on Federal and District Law,</i>

307
00:19:57.624 --> 00:20:01.025
<i>the Constitution and with no
legal precedent to draw from,</i>


308
00:20:01.028 --> 00:20:03.262
<i>I have no choice but to
side with the defence.</i>


309
00:20:03.264 --> 00:20:04.930
<i>Mr. Nelson, you are free to go.</i>

310
00:20:06.233 --> 00:20:09.735
<i>The murder trial
in Cheyenne this morning</i>


311
00:20:09.737 --> 00:20:12.104
<i>has taken yet another
unexpected turn.</i>


312
00:20:12.105 --> 00:20:13.905
<i>During today's preliminary hearing,</i>

313
00:20:13.907 --> 00:20:15.640
<i>confessed murderer, 
Dwayne Nelson,</i>

314
00:20:15.643 --> 00:20:18.176
<i>was acquitted of all charges</i>

315
00:20:18.178 --> 00:20:21.413
<i>due to what can only be
described as a flaw in the system.</i>


316
00:20:21.414 --> 00:20:22.412
<i>...an unusual case.</i>

317
00:20:22.414 --> 00:20:24.682
<i>And families are
understandably shocked</i>


318
00:20:24.684 --> 00:20:25.782
<i>with the Judge's decision.</i>

319
00:20:25.784 --> 00:20:27.718
<i>Imagine a murderer
being allowed to</i>


320
00:20:27.719 --> 00:20:29.152
<i>walk the streets as a free man.</i>

321
00:20:29.154 --> 00:20:31.821
<i>That's exactly what took
place here today.</i>


322
00:20:35.327 --> 00:20:39.063
I remember there was
absolute confusion


323
00:20:39.066 --> 00:20:40.332
and shock.

324
00:20:40.334 --> 00:20:41.567
All hell broke loose.

325
00:20:41.967 --> 00:20:43.301
Right? It was...

326
00:20:44.102 --> 00:20:45.970
Insanity.

327
00:20:45.973 --> 00:20:48.774
We weren't prepared for that.
I wasn't prepared for that.


328
00:20:48.775 --> 00:20:50.641
This guy should have been
put away for life.


329
00:20:52.778 --> 00:20:54.745
<i>It was so far beyond logic.</i>

330
00:20:55.747 --> 00:20:57.315
<i>So far beyond reason.</i>

331
00:20:57.316 --> 00:20:59.049
<i>It was... it was...</i>

332
00:21:00.619 --> 00:21:01.852
<i>Beyond justice.</i>

333
00:21:04.355 --> 00:21:06.656
<i>And the worst part
was feeling the shift.</i>


334
00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:10.995
You know, 'cause it was like Dwayne

335
00:21:10.996 --> 00:21:12.228
was no longer the bad guy.

336
00:21:13.364 --> 00:21:14.364
I was.

337
00:21:16.201 --> 00:21:18.670
<i>And it was the assistants
that came in</i>


338
00:21:19.371 --> 00:21:21.705
<i>and gave us the news initially.</i>

339
00:21:22.873 --> 00:21:24.172
<i>So they could be the recipients</i>

340
00:21:24.174 --> 00:21:27.111
<i>of all of our grief and all
of our anger at that moment.</i>


341
00:21:27.612 --> 00:21:29.045
And then the head team came in

342
00:21:29.548 --> 00:21:31.548
and explained to us
what had happened.


343
00:21:33.650 --> 00:21:35.751
<i>The loophole
in the law changed everything.</i>


344
00:21:36.621 --> 00:21:37.622
<i>And unless we could prove</i>

345
00:21:37.625 --> 00:21:39.923
<i>that the murders
were premeditated,</i>


346
00:21:39.925 --> 00:21:42.794
<i>or that a felony was committed
leading up to the murders,</i>


347
00:21:43.295 --> 00:21:45.795
<i>this crime could not
and cannot be tried.</i>


348
00:21:45.798 --> 00:21:46.864
<i>You need a motive.</i>

349
00:21:46.866 --> 00:21:48.633
We need motive to move the trail,

350
00:21:48.734 --> 00:21:51.701
to get him out from under the
protection of that goddamn loophole.


351
00:21:52.937 --> 00:21:54.704
<i>We had covered all the bases.</i>

352
00:21:54.706 --> 00:21:56.339
<i>We had looked for any connection</i>

353
00:21:56.340 --> 00:21:58.641
<i>between Dwayne Nelson
and his murder victims.</i>


354
00:21:58.643 --> 00:21:59.541
<i>But there wasn't any.</i>

355
00:21:59.643 --> 00:22:00.909
<i>Dwayne was from North Dakota,</i>

356
00:22:00.912 --> 00:22:03.413
<i>and the boys were
from Rapid City.</i>


357
00:22:04.914 --> 00:22:06.348
So, as Dwayne confessed,

358
00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:08.984
it was an isolated incident.
There was no motive.


359
00:22:10.754 --> 00:22:13.089
<i>We were all regular...</i>

360
00:22:14.191 --> 00:22:15.858
<i>People who didn't
even understand</i>


361
00:22:15.861 --> 00:22:17.260
<i>half of the system to begin with.</i>

362
00:22:18.728 --> 00:22:22.064
<i>And once we began
with the whole</i>


363
00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:26.436
State line, Federal, the State...

364
00:22:27.237 --> 00:22:31.272
I think we just assumed
that they would work it out.


365
00:22:32.442 --> 00:22:35.511
I don't think anyone
really understood


366
00:22:35.913 --> 00:22:37.480
the ramifications of this.

367
00:22:37.882 --> 00:22:39.448
I think there was a feeling,

368
00:22:39.450 --> 00:22:41.350
certainly in me,

369
00:22:41.351 --> 00:22:43.418
and I know in a few
of the others, was that


370
00:22:43.421 --> 00:22:46.855
this was just maybe the first step

371
00:22:46.858 --> 00:22:49.660
in crossing this huge hurdle,

372
00:22:50.361 --> 00:22:53.095
<i>and that we would
stick with it,</i>


373
00:22:53.097 --> 00:22:54.295
<i>and there would be appeals,</i>

374
00:22:54.297 --> 00:22:57.967
<i>and everyone would throw
their weight behind this.</i>


375
00:22:58.168 --> 00:23:01.002
<i>And as the weeks,
and eventually months, passed,</i>


376
00:23:01.005 --> 00:23:03.506
<i>and we realised,</i>

377
00:23:03.707 --> 00:23:07.275
<i>"No. No, this isn't...
This isn't changing.</i>


378
00:23:07.378 --> 00:23:10.579
This really is not changing
in our favour."


379
00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:13.915
There was an incredible
amount of anger.


380
00:23:13.918 --> 00:23:16.118
I don't feel guilty for
adhering to the Constitution.


381
00:23:17.954 --> 00:23:19.088
I don't feel guilty

382
00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:20.790
doing what's right
according to the law.


383
00:23:22.425 --> 00:23:24.426
Right? I don't feel guilty

384
00:23:24.428 --> 00:23:26.762
for letting a man walk

385
00:23:26.763 --> 00:23:29.430
because the Constitution
says that he should.


386
00:23:30.366 --> 00:23:31.366
I'm doing my job.

387
00:23:32.735 --> 00:23:34.502
The Court did their job.

388
00:23:34.504 --> 00:23:36.204
We all did our job on this.

389
00:23:39.042 --> 00:23:40.509
He walks.
He's supposed to walk.


390
00:23:41.343 --> 00:23:42.510
Right?

391
00:23:46.050 --> 00:23:47.117
Simple.

392
00:23:51.888 --> 00:23:53.756
The fuck are we on?

393
00:23:53.758 --> 00:23:55.824
Left on the main street.

394
00:23:55.925 --> 00:23:59.127
<i>Daniel Matcek was a local
Yellowstone  newspaper reporter.</i>


395
00:23:59.530 --> 00:24:00.528
<i>He covered the hearings</i>

396
00:24:00.530 --> 00:24:02.598
<i>and spent a lot of time
researching the murders.</i>


397
00:24:03.299 --> 00:24:04.466
<i>It's a small town,</i>

398
00:24:05.268 --> 00:24:06.766
<i>and I've lived here
my whole life.</i>


399
00:24:06.768 --> 00:24:08.770
<i>And nothing like this has
ever happened before.</i>


400
00:24:08.772 --> 00:24:11.506
<i>So I have a responsibility
to tell the story.</i>


401
00:24:12.307 --> 00:24:16.243
<i>I actually call my article
"The Inconceivable Truth".</i>


402
00:24:17.046 --> 00:24:19.447
It's so funny that it
became a constitutional debate.


403
00:24:20.249 --> 00:24:21.916
Three boys were shot

404
00:24:21.918 --> 00:24:23.317
and killed.

405
00:24:23.319 --> 00:24:25.153
In cold blood.

406
00:24:25.154 --> 00:24:27.120
This is not a constitutional issue.

407
00:24:27.122 --> 00:24:28.889
It became a constitutional issue

408
00:24:28.891 --> 00:24:31.592
because Dwayne made it
a constitutional issue.


409
00:24:31.895 --> 00:24:34.462
There's three dead boys,

410
00:24:34.464 --> 00:24:35.930
and no one went to jail for it.

411
00:24:36.832 --> 00:24:38.099
No one was punished for it.

412
00:24:38.534 --> 00:24:39.433
What did he do?

413
00:24:39.435 --> 00:24:42.670
Six months for illegal
possession of a firearm


414
00:24:42.671 --> 00:24:44.071
in a National Park?

415
00:24:44.173 --> 00:24:45.272
It's a joke.

416
00:24:45.275 --> 00:24:46.841
That is a joke

417
00:24:46.843 --> 00:24:48.309
to those families.

418
00:24:48.311 --> 00:24:50.912
I am still angry.

419
00:24:52.147 --> 00:24:53.281
I'm still in shock.

420
00:24:54.582 --> 00:24:59.352
I still feel completely
betrayed by a system that


421
00:24:59.354 --> 00:25:02.055
not only did I think
that was on my side,


422
00:25:02.057 --> 00:25:04.457
but I was assured
it was on my side.


423
00:25:04.461 --> 00:25:06.161
Who came up
with the loophole defence?


424
00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:08.564
I don't recall.

425
00:25:08.566 --> 00:25:10.332
I don't recall.

426
00:25:10.333 --> 00:25:11.599
We started throwing around...

427
00:25:11.601 --> 00:25:13.301
It was an idea that...

428
00:25:14.103 --> 00:25:16.304
Looked more and more
interesting the more we looked at it.


429
00:25:16.507 --> 00:25:18.073
And we started to run with it.

430
00:25:18.074 --> 00:25:20.474
But you don't recall
who came up with the one..


431
00:25:20.477 --> 00:25:22.244
I don't recall.

432
00:25:22.246 --> 00:25:24.347
I find that impossible to believe.

433
00:25:24.848 --> 00:25:26.647
- You find that impossible to believe?
- Yeah.


434
00:25:26.982 --> 00:25:28.316
Look, uh...

435
00:25:29.118 --> 00:25:30.284
It was the basis of your entire..

436
00:25:30.387 --> 00:25:31.587
I was told that you were
coming in here


437
00:25:31.588 --> 00:25:32.487
to talk to me

438
00:25:33.189 --> 00:25:34.822
about practising law in Cheyenne.

439
00:25:34.925 --> 00:25:35.923
Well, this is part of it.

440
00:25:35.925 --> 00:25:38.393
Not specific elements
about specific cases. Okay?


441
00:25:38.395 --> 00:25:39.461
You want that stuff?

442
00:25:39.462 --> 00:25:41.362
If you want it,
you can go down to the Court,


443
00:25:41.364 --> 00:25:43.865
there are Court records,
you can take a look at all that stuff.


444
00:25:44.167 --> 00:25:45.199
Okay? It's all there for you.

445
00:25:46.568 --> 00:25:47.935
- Okay.
- All right? Are we good here?


446
00:25:47.937 --> 00:25:48.803
Can we just back up a little?

447
00:25:48.905 --> 00:25:49.938
'Cause I'm good.

448
00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:52.206
I'm good. All right?
Thank you very much.


449
00:25:52.209 --> 00:25:53.574
I appreciate you coming by,
I really do.


450
00:25:53.644 --> 00:25:54.743
Thank you. Thank you.

451
00:26:04.286 --> 00:26:05.285
<i>I went to the Courthouse,</i>

452
00:26:05.287 --> 00:26:07.555
<i>but was denied access
to the records.</i>


453
00:26:07.957 --> 00:26:09.991
<i>I was told the documents
had been sealed,</i>


454
00:26:09.992 --> 00:26:11.224
<i>but they couldn't tell me why.</i>

455
00:26:21.969 --> 00:26:24.104
<i>Investigating the loophole, however,</i>

456
00:26:24.106 --> 00:26:25.038
<i>was much easier.</i>

457
00:26:29.210 --> 00:26:31.244
<i>The Constitution is
the Supreme law</i>


458
00:26:31.246 --> 00:26:33.380
<i>for every citizen living
in the United States.</i>


459
00:26:34.516 --> 00:26:36.450
<i>But the Constitution
that protects us</i>


460
00:26:36.452 --> 00:26:38.452
<i>also let a murderer go free.</i>

461
00:26:41.055 --> 00:26:44.124
<i>Article three, Section two
of the Constitution...</i>


462
00:26:51.599 --> 00:26:53.366
<i>This, however, does not clarify</i>

463
00:26:53.368 --> 00:26:54.867
<i>where the jury
should come from.</i>


464
00:26:55.670 --> 00:26:57.704
<i>So the sixth amendment
was written,</i>


465
00:26:57.706 --> 00:26:59.406
<i>requiring that the jury must be...</i>

466
00:27:06.648 --> 00:27:08.683
<i>So based on the Constitution,</i>

467
00:27:08.684 --> 00:27:10.517
<i>any person charged with murder</i>

468
00:27:10.519 --> 00:27:13.053
<i>must be tried
before a local jury</i>


469

<i>that comes from
the State and District</i>


470

00:27:40.615 --> 00:27:43.683
<i>is where the law and
civil rights collide.</i>


480
00:27:45.721 --> 00:27:48.422
<i>Yellowstone Park is not
governed by State law.</i>


481
00:27:49.223 --> 00:27:50.657
<i>It is ruled under Federal law.</i>

482
00:27:51.659 --> 00:27:54.094
<i>So any crime committed in the Park</i>

483
00:27:54.095 --> 00:27:56.595
<i>must be tried at the Courthouse
in Mammoth Hot Springs.</i>


484
00:27:56.597 --> 00:27:59.365
<i>Or in Cheyenne at
the Federal District Court.</i>


485
00:28:00.302 --> 00:28:02.336
<i>So what does this all mean?</i>

486
00:28:02.337 --> 00:28:06.039
<i>The jurors must be drawn
from this small strip of land</i>


487
00:28:06.041 --> 00:28:08.141
<i>of approximately 50 square miles.</i>

488
00:28:09.642 --> 00:28:11.076
<i>There is only one problem.</i>

489
00:28:12.145 --> 00:28:13.479
<i>No one lives here.</i>

490
00:28:14.314 --> 00:28:16.281
<i>You cannot select a jury of 12</i>

491
00:28:16.283 --> 00:28:20.185
<i>from an area that has
a population of zero.</i>


492
00:28:33.367 --> 00:28:35.135
Hello, sir.

493
00:28:35.137 --> 00:28:36.770
Can I ask you a question?

494
00:28:36.772 --> 00:28:37.671
Sorry to interrupt you.

495
00:28:37.672 --> 00:28:38.838
I know you're in the middle
of your meal there.


496
00:28:39.340 --> 00:28:40.372
But, uh...

497
00:28:42.108 --> 00:28:43.309
You or anyone from your herd

498
00:28:43.411 --> 00:28:44.643
happen to have been in the region

499
00:28:44.646 --> 00:28:45.879
where there's, uh,

500
00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:47.580
a supposed constitutional loophole,

501
00:28:48.182 --> 00:28:49.214
near the Idaho side?

502
00:28:50.450 --> 00:28:51.684
No?

503
00:28:51.786 --> 00:28:53.385
Or any of your family
or associates?


504
00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:55.720
Nothing?

505
00:28:57.089 --> 00:28:58.556
Deutsch? Speak Deutsch?

506
00:29:05.832 --> 00:29:07.332
It's just right up here.

507
00:29:19.244 --> 00:29:21.446
So if these maps are right,

508
00:29:21.448 --> 00:29:23.381
I think this is pretty much
the line here.


509
00:29:25.083 --> 00:29:27.184
So somewhere around here...

510
00:29:28.419 --> 00:29:30.787
Is the loophole in the Constitution.

511
00:29:31.623 --> 00:29:33.124
And somewhere around here

512
00:29:34.661 --> 00:29:36.328
is the no loophole
in the Constitution.


513
00:29:37.596 --> 00:29:40.364
So the boundary is
kind of right there.


514
00:29:40.366 --> 00:29:42.333
Most people,
when they hear about it,


515
00:29:42.335 --> 00:29:44.769
they focus on the simple
matters of the case.


516
00:29:44.772 --> 00:29:45.704
They...

517
00:29:46.572 --> 00:29:47.973
Broad strokes.

518
00:29:48.775 --> 00:29:50.842
The murders, the hole
in the Constitution.


519
00:29:50.844 --> 00:29:52.443
And understandably so.

520
00:29:52.445 --> 00:29:54.612
I mean, these are
the boldest parts of the case.


521
00:29:54.613 --> 00:29:57.147
But you can't,
and you really shouldn't


522
00:29:57.149 --> 00:29:59.216
miss the kind of

523
00:29:59.619 --> 00:30:01.385
mind boggling things

524
00:30:01.386 --> 00:30:03.753
that happened from the murders

525
00:30:03.755 --> 00:30:05.422
up until the Court hearing.

526
00:30:05.425 --> 00:30:06.457
All right?

527
00:30:06.459 --> 00:30:08.192
Number one.

528
00:30:08.193 --> 00:30:10.760
Dwayne turns himself in
voluntarily almost immediately.


529
00:30:10.762 --> 00:30:12.762
Number two...

530
00:30:12.764 --> 00:30:15.232
He confesses, within his rights,

531
00:30:15.234 --> 00:30:16.867
without representation
or legal counsel.


532
00:30:16.869 --> 00:30:18.201
Number three...

533
00:30:18.203 --> 00:30:19.402
He refuses

534
00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:21.206
to plead insanity.

535
00:30:21.208 --> 00:30:22.908
Number four, he refuses to move

536
00:30:24.143 --> 00:30:25.443
the trial.

537
00:30:25.445 --> 00:30:26.811
Now if you add all
those four things up,


538
00:30:26.813 --> 00:30:28.279
and he goes away
for a triple homicide,


539
00:30:28.381 --> 00:30:29.514
you can say, "fine."

540
00:30:29.917 --> 00:30:32.351
But he didn't.
He got away with it.


541
00:30:32.353 --> 00:30:34.419
And not because he had a fair trial,

542
00:30:34.421 --> 00:30:37.390
or there was reasonable doubt raised.

543
00:30:38.392 --> 00:30:40.159
But that there was
a hole in the Constitution.


544
00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:41.959
An overlap.

545
00:30:44.330 --> 00:30:45.831
Now you consider those
four things again.


546
00:30:46.866 --> 00:30:48.400
Without them,

547
00:30:48.402 --> 00:30:51.203
he goes away for
a very, very long time.


548
00:30:52.371 --> 00:30:53.470
So you're suggesting that

549
00:30:53.472 --> 00:30:55.840
Dwayne knew exactly
what he was doing?


550
00:30:56.342 --> 00:30:58.643
That's exactly what I'm suggesting.

551
00:30:58.645 --> 00:31:00.645
Of course, the only person that's
gonna know the answer to that


552
00:31:00.648 --> 00:31:01.614
is Dwayne.

553
00:31:01.616 --> 00:31:03.582
Why haven't there been
further investigations into this?


554
00:31:03.884 --> 00:31:05.784
Well, this whole thing was
swept under the rug.


555
00:31:06.819 --> 00:31:08.187
It's an embarrassment.

556
00:31:08.888 --> 00:31:10.956
A hole in the Constitution!

557
00:31:12.959 --> 00:31:15.327
No, I think the right people
leaned in the right places


558
00:31:15.329 --> 00:31:16.662
to make sure that this
all went away


559
00:31:16.664 --> 00:31:18.330
before it became a National uproar.

560
00:31:18.432 --> 00:31:20.699
So the Government basically
helped a guilty man go free,


561
00:31:20.701 --> 00:31:21.800
is what you're saying?

562
00:31:21.802 --> 00:31:23.969
No. I'm saying
Dwayne helped himself.


563
00:31:25.337 --> 00:31:26.772
This cover up

564
00:31:27.574 --> 00:31:29.740
is just a happy consequence for him.

565
00:31:31.911 --> 00:31:35.280
<i>When you dig
into Dwayne's past,</i>


566
00:31:35.282 --> 00:31:38.951
<i>you're gonna find a broken,
shattered man.</i>


567
00:31:38.953 --> 00:31:40.919
<i>I don't know.
I watched his interrogation,</i>


568
00:31:41.554 --> 00:31:43.455
<i>his confession.</i>

569
00:31:43.457 --> 00:31:44.723
<i>Was that a man on the edge,</i>

570
00:31:44.725 --> 00:31:46.391
<i>or a man in complete control?</i>

571
00:31:46.393 --> 00:31:51.263
<i>The only person who really
knows what happened that day</i>


572
00:31:51.797 --> 00:31:52.797
<i>is Dwayne.</i>

573
00:31:56.235 --> 00:31:58.536
<i>I decided to head
out to Williston, North Dakota,</i>


574
00:31:58.538 --> 00:32:00.972
<i>to see what the people of
Dwayne's hometown had to say.</i>


575
00:32:04.676 --> 00:32:06.844
Have you heard of
the Yellowstone murders


576
00:32:06.845 --> 00:32:07.811
and Dwayne Nelson?

577
00:32:07.813 --> 00:32:08.778
- Yes.
- Yeah.


578
00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:09.378
You have.

579
00:32:09.380 --> 00:32:11.248
Can I just ask you a quick
question about them?


580
00:32:11.451 --> 00:32:12.750
- Oh, no.
- No?


581
00:32:12.752 --> 00:32:14.185
We really don't wanna
answer any questions.


582
00:32:14.186 --> 00:32:15.585
Okay. Thanks very much anyway.

583
00:32:24.395 --> 00:32:25.595
No, I'm really not interested.

584
00:32:25.597 --> 00:32:27.597
No? Okay, well, thank you.

585
00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:30.801
Sorry, not right now.
I really must run.


586
00:32:30.803 --> 00:32:32.303
- Okay. Thank you.
- Sorry.


587
00:32:38.009 --> 00:32:39.943
Ever heard of Dwayne Nelson
and the Yellowstone murders?


588
00:32:39.945 --> 00:32:41.645
Uh, yeah. Sir, I don't
wanna talk about that.


589
00:32:41.647 --> 00:32:43.780
Can you just answer
just maybe on... no?


590
00:32:43.982 --> 00:32:44.981
Fuck!

591
00:32:48.754 --> 00:32:51.289
<i>People in town were
reluctant to speak at all.</i>


592
00:32:52.990 --> 00:32:55.025
<i>But those closest to Dwayne
before the murders</i>


593
00:32:55.027 --> 00:32:56.593
<i>welcomed us with open arms.</i>

594
00:33:11.374 --> 00:33:12.808
- Hi, Rachel?
- Hi. Yeah.


595
00:33:12.810 --> 00:33:13.842
How are you? Julian.

596
00:33:13.844 --> 00:33:14.943
- Julian? Hi.
- Yeah.


597
00:33:14.946 --> 00:33:15.912
This is Adam.

598
00:33:16.514 --> 00:33:17.113
Right.

599
00:33:19.016 --> 00:33:20.583
Come on in.
I'll take your coat.


600
00:33:20.585 --> 00:33:21.918
Okay. Thank you very much.

601
00:33:22.886 --> 00:33:24.486
So you knew Dwayne?

602
00:33:24.488 --> 00:33:25.454
- Yeah.
- Yeah?


603
00:33:25.456 --> 00:33:26.755
- Dwayne and Carol. Yeah.
- Okay.


604
00:33:26.757 --> 00:33:28.357
- They were like family.
- Were they?


605
00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:29.658
- Lovely couple.
- Okay.


606
00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:31.361
<i>After graduating high school late,</i>

607
00:33:31.463 --> 00:33:32.729
<i>Dwayne married his sweetheart,</i>

608
00:33:32.931 --> 00:33:35.365
<i>Carol Harson, at the age of 23.</i>

609
00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:38.834
<i>She met Dwayne...</i>

610
00:33:38.836 --> 00:33:41.470
Actually we were in the car together.

611
00:33:41.472 --> 00:33:44.340
And we were going to, uh...

612
00:33:44.441 --> 00:33:46.641
To the bar and...

613
00:33:46.645 --> 00:33:48.945
It was winter and the car got stuck.

614
00:33:48.947 --> 00:33:51.482
And, um...

615
00:33:52.683 --> 00:33:56.885
I was driving, and she was
out trying to push the car,


616
00:33:57.654 --> 00:33:59.455
and Dwayne came by

617
00:33:59.456 --> 00:34:02.090
and he was sort of like
a knight in shining armour.


618
00:34:02.093 --> 00:34:04.059
I wasn't too sure about him at first.

619
00:34:04.061 --> 00:34:05.094
He, uh...

620
00:34:05.762 --> 00:34:07.596
He was really quiet.

621
00:34:07.597 --> 00:34:08.629
<i>Like really quiet.</i>

622
00:34:09.031 --> 00:34:11.132
<i>And smart.</i>

623
00:34:11.134 --> 00:34:12.767
<i>But he, uh...</i>

624
00:34:14.535 --> 00:34:15.770
He just was...

625
00:34:16.873 --> 00:34:19.474
He wasn't what I thought
Carol would go for.


626
00:34:23.779 --> 00:34:24.946
<i>He was a great family man.</i>

627
00:34:24.948 --> 00:34:26.881
<i>Him and Carol, they were...</i>

628
00:34:26.884 --> 00:34:28.917
<i>They were close, and...</i>

629
00:34:30.053 --> 00:34:31.720
You know, I...

630
00:34:31.722 --> 00:34:33.522
He's the kind of guy
that you'd wanna


631
00:34:33.524 --> 00:34:36.458
emulate, I guess,
is a good word to use.


632
00:34:36.459 --> 00:34:39.660
<i>You probably had it
growing up, too, that buddy,</i>


633
00:34:39.662 --> 00:34:41.796
<i>you know, that you could
just conversate with.</i>


634
00:34:42.097 --> 00:34:43.598
You know?

635
00:34:43.599 --> 00:34:45.465
There was no dead space
when you spoke with him.


636
00:34:46.702 --> 00:34:47.935
Oh, us going back.

637
00:34:49.539 --> 00:34:51.707
Bear took us into Yellowstone
many times.


638
00:34:53.041 --> 00:34:54.409
I would...

639
00:34:54.411 --> 00:34:57.445
I would tag along when
my family didn't


640
00:34:58.647 --> 00:34:59.614
want me around,

641
00:35:00.116 --> 00:35:01.116
or whatever.

642
00:35:01.118 --> 00:35:02.651
And Dwayne...

643
00:35:03.186 --> 00:35:05.087
Dwayne and Bear,

644
00:35:05.089 --> 00:35:06.922
they went in
pretty much all the time.


645
00:35:06.923 --> 00:35:08.489
Sorry, "Bear"?

646
00:35:08.491 --> 00:35:10.191
<i>Bear, his dad.
He called Bear.</i>


647
00:35:10.859 --> 00:35:11.993
<i>Um...</i>

648
00:35:12.861 --> 00:35:13.828
<i>Yeah.</i>

649
00:35:14.897 --> 00:35:16.497
Yeah. He was, uh...

650
00:35:19.102 --> 00:35:20.935
You know, sometimes you get...

651
00:35:20.937 --> 00:35:22.870
When the husband's watching TV,
you know,


652
00:35:22.872 --> 00:35:24.839
the wife's always complaining.

653
00:35:24.841 --> 00:35:28.209
"He's not with us enough.
He's not with us enough." Right?


654
00:35:28.211 --> 00:35:30.645
But you know, Carol, she just...

655
00:35:31.981 --> 00:35:33.282
She let him be him,

656
00:35:34.351 --> 00:35:35.217
and he let her be her.

657
00:35:38.122 --> 00:35:39.823
<i>Five years into their marriage,</i>

658
00:35:39.825 --> 00:35:42.492
<i>Carol gave birth to
their first child, Lily.</i>


659
00:35:42.494 --> 00:35:45.495
<i>However, when Lily was only
six-years-old,</i>


660
00:35:45.497 --> 00:35:47.530
<i>there was a deadly accident
in their home.</i>


661
00:35:49.867 --> 00:35:51.634
<i>A fire erupted in their kitchen.</i>

662
00:35:51.635 --> 00:35:54.536
<i>Dwayne heard his child's
screams from outside,</i>


663
00:35:54.539 --> 00:35:56.573
<i>and ran to try to save her.</i>

664
00:35:56.575 --> 00:35:58.575
<i>But the fire had raged too long.</i>

665
00:35:59.542 --> 00:36:00.641
<i>Lily was already dead,</i>

666
00:36:00.643 --> 00:36:04.347
<i>and Dwayne suffered third degree
burns on his hands and arms.</i>


667
00:36:05.249 --> 00:36:08.917
<i>It's devastating
when your child dies like that.</i>


668
00:36:08.919 --> 00:36:11.186
<i>I can't imagine myself,</i>

669
00:36:12.021 --> 00:36:12.988
<i>but for them...</i>

670
00:36:14.691 --> 00:36:15.590
It was horrible.

671
00:36:15.592 --> 00:36:18.494
I think Carol somehow dealt
with it better than Dwayne,


672
00:36:18.596 --> 00:36:19.462
in a way.

673
00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:22.263
The scars that he had,

674
00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:26.268
that was like his memory of her.

675
00:36:27.271 --> 00:36:29.205
He just shut down.

676
00:36:30.174 --> 00:36:31.875
<i>It's remarkable,</i>

677
00:36:31.877 --> 00:36:34.177
I think that their
marriage survived that.


678
00:36:34.179 --> 00:36:37.114
Because lots of marriages don't,
you know.


679
00:36:37.615 --> 00:36:39.148
When you lose a child, it's...

680
00:36:39.650 --> 00:36:41.884
It's a terrible, terrible thing.

681
00:36:45.755 --> 00:36:47.122
<i>He was ecstatic, you know,</i>

682
00:36:47.124 --> 00:36:48.857
when Carol became
pregnant again.


683
00:36:49.759 --> 00:36:51.527
<i>You know? But, um...</i>

684
00:36:52.294 --> 00:36:54.095
<i>He was, um...</i>

685
00:36:54.097 --> 00:36:57.532
<i>Absolutely terrified of
losing another child.</i>


686
00:37:02.639 --> 00:37:04.540
<i>If that was
gonna happen, you know,</i>


687
00:37:04.542 --> 00:37:06.675
<i>you'd want it to happen to like,</i>

688
00:37:06.676 --> 00:37:08.042
<i>an evil person, you know.</i>

689
00:37:08.044 --> 00:37:09.210
<i>But I mean, he was...</i>

690
00:37:10.546 --> 00:37:12.013
He was one of the good guys.

691
00:37:13.848 --> 00:37:15.649
It's terrible.

692
00:37:15.652 --> 00:37:17.218
Then Carol was diagnosed with cancer.

693
00:37:19.054 --> 00:37:21.289
<i>And she was
four-and-a-half months pregnant.</i>


694
00:37:24.125 --> 00:37:25.091
<i>So...</i>

695
00:37:26.328 --> 00:37:27.428
<i>She had to make a choice.</i>

696
00:37:31.634 --> 00:37:33.235
Take the chemotherapy and

697
00:37:34.436 --> 00:37:36.905
risk the health of her baby, or...

698
00:37:40.075 --> 00:37:40.674
Well...

699
00:37:43.144 --> 00:37:45.912
When Carol died,
that was it for Dwayne.


700
00:37:48.717 --> 00:37:51.519
He still lived in town, but he
practically disappeared.


701
00:37:54.188 --> 00:37:56.156
Could you tell me about how

702
00:37:56.158 --> 00:37:58.725
the death of Carol affected you

703
00:37:58.727 --> 00:37:59.960
on a personal level?

704
00:38:01.063 --> 00:38:02.296
She was my best friend.

705
00:38:03.765 --> 00:38:04.899
Um...

706
00:38:06.033 --> 00:38:07.133
And I still miss her.

707
00:38:08.936 --> 00:38:09.970
It was hard.

708
00:38:12.606 --> 00:38:13.739
Uh...

709
00:38:17.745 --> 00:38:19.045
It was hard.

710
00:38:19.047 --> 00:38:20.914
<i>The loss is just so deep,</i>

711
00:38:22.382 --> 00:38:25.918
<i>that anything you say is stupid.</i>

712
00:38:28.088 --> 00:38:30.789
You know?
It's gonna get better?


713
00:38:30.793 --> 00:38:32.360
You're gonna say that to him?
It's gonna get better?


714
00:38:32.362 --> 00:38:33.760
'Cause it's not gonna get better.

715
00:38:35.997 --> 00:38:38.164
<i>I wasn't in touch with him much,</i>

716
00:38:38.166 --> 00:38:40.133
<i>you know, at that time.</i>

717
00:38:40.135 --> 00:38:41.601
<i>But you know,
that's life, right?</i>


718
00:38:41.603 --> 00:38:43.069
I mean, people drift apart.

719
00:38:43.170 --> 00:38:44.303
That's what happens, man.

720
00:38:44.305 --> 00:38:47.106
Everybody leaves everybody
in the end.


721
00:38:47.908 --> 00:38:48.842
Right?

722
00:38:48.944 --> 00:38:50.945
Uh, the baby was...

723
00:38:54.248 --> 00:38:55.749
It was not...

724
00:38:56.183 --> 00:38:57.384
Quite right.

725
00:38:57.385 --> 00:38:59.251
It was premature.

726
00:38:59.253 --> 00:39:00.753
<i>And, uh...</i>

727
00:39:00.756 --> 00:39:04.658
<i>His little lungs
weren't formed properly.</i>


728
00:39:07.328 --> 00:39:08.527
<i>It's understandable that</i>

729
00:39:08.529 --> 00:39:11.831
<i>such a series of tragedies
would change a person.</i>


730
00:39:12.899 --> 00:39:13.899
For him, it...

731
00:39:15.136 --> 00:39:16.570
He had to find a reason

732
00:39:17.672 --> 00:39:18.771
why these things happened.

733
00:39:18.773 --> 00:39:20.974
It was inconceivable
that it could just...


734
00:39:22.976 --> 00:39:24.343
That that could just happen.

735
00:39:24.346 --> 00:39:26.112
I don't blame him
for thinking that.


736
00:39:27.447 --> 00:39:29.649
What I do blame him for
is what he did.


737
00:39:30.452 --> 00:39:32.252
What I blame him for
is the fact that he


738
00:39:33.455 --> 00:39:35.256
sought out a way

739
00:39:35.257 --> 00:39:37.424
to punish us all

740
00:39:39.193 --> 00:39:41.161
for what he thought
happened to him.


741
00:39:58.143 --> 00:40:00.945
<i>There was no way
of contacting Dwayne.</i>


742
00:40:00.948 --> 00:40:02.715
<i>Any numbers I managed to dig up</i>

743
00:40:02.717 --> 00:40:04.216
<i>rang without a machine.</i>

744
00:40:04.217 --> 00:40:06.751
<i>There were no
email addresses, nothing.</i>


745
00:40:08.288 --> 00:40:09.387
<i>Through further research,</i>

746
00:40:09.389 --> 00:40:12.324
<i>I found a PO Box
located in a small town,</i>


747
00:40:12.325 --> 00:40:14.459
<i>just outside of Windsor, Ontario.</i>

748
00:40:15.395 --> 00:40:17.162
<i>He was living in Canada now.</i>

749
00:40:19.064 --> 00:40:21.032
<i>The more research I did,</i>

750
00:40:21.034 --> 00:40:22.467
<i>the more questions were raised.</i>

751
00:40:37.117 --> 00:40:38.884
<i>After his wife passed,</i>

752
00:40:38.886 --> 00:40:41.920
<i>Dwayne spent a lot of time
at the local library.</i>


753
00:40:41.921 --> 00:40:44.288
<i>We were all
so broken up about it.</i>


754
00:40:45.024 --> 00:40:47.259
<i>After Carol passed,</i>

755
00:40:47.261 --> 00:40:50.129
<i>he never really recovered, I think.</i>

756
00:40:51.530 --> 00:40:53.566
<i>I didn't wanna pry too much.</i>

757
00:40:54.770 --> 00:40:57.871
<i>And he wasn't the kind of person
who made you feel comfortable.</i>


758
00:40:59.506 --> 00:41:01.140
<i>He liked it here.</i>

759
00:41:02.810 --> 00:41:04.811
He didn't talk to anybody.
We just left him alone.


760
00:41:06.312 --> 00:41:08.013
Quiet. Quiet guy.

761
00:41:09.483 --> 00:41:11.151
<i>It's a small town,</i>

762
00:41:11.152 --> 00:41:13.418
we all go to church, and...

763
00:41:15.256 --> 00:41:18.792
I think when we found out that
Dwayne had done these things,


764
00:41:18.793 --> 00:41:21.527
there was a real feeling of betrayal.

765
00:41:22.330 --> 00:41:25.498
How could somebody that
was part of our community


766
00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:26.833
have gone so wrong?

767
00:41:29.102 --> 00:41:32.171
I'll tell you. It was all anyone
talked about for a long time.


768
00:41:32.174 --> 00:41:34.974
But nobody really wants
to talk about it anymore.


769
00:41:37.811 --> 00:41:39.311
<i>They were three young boys,</i>

770
00:41:39.313 --> 00:41:41.146
<i>you know, and...</i>

771
00:41:42.015 --> 00:41:43.517
<i>I don't know, it's...</i>

772
00:41:44.820 --> 00:41:48.555
I've got a lot of mixed feelings
about the whole thing, obviously.


773
00:41:49.222 --> 00:41:50.322
Why would he...

774
00:41:50.890 --> 00:41:52.191
Do that?

775
00:41:52.193 --> 00:41:54.126
You know?
He knows what loss is.


776
00:41:54.128 --> 00:41:55.994
<i>Right? He knows what loss is.</i>

777
00:41:56.595 --> 00:41:58.529
He lost Carol, he lost Lily.

778
00:41:58.531 --> 00:42:02.501
You know, these boys,
they're someone's son.


779
00:42:03.203 --> 00:42:05.603
Right? He knows what it's like
to lose a child. He knows.


780
00:42:09.007 --> 00:42:10.006
<i>I was still confused</i>

781
00:42:10.008 --> 00:42:13.945
<i>as to why a seemingly good natured,
hard working family man</i>


782
00:42:14.247 --> 00:42:18.983
<i>would brutally murder David,
Cody and Thomas.</i>


783
00:42:20.185 --> 00:42:22.553
<i>Three young men,
who by all accounts,</i>


784
00:42:22.556 --> 00:42:24.223
<i>were innocent.</i>

785
00:42:26.592 --> 00:42:29.594
Cody, growing up, was lovely.

786
00:42:29.897 --> 00:42:34.199
He was smart and funny.

787
00:42:34.500 --> 00:42:38.069
Very, uh, very happy kid.
Very open kid.


788
00:42:39.271 --> 00:42:42.006
<i>And wonderful with other children,</i>

789
00:42:42.007 --> 00:42:46.342
<i>whether they were younger,
older, or his own age. He was always...</i>


790
00:42:46.346 --> 00:42:47.546
<i>A very compassionate child.</i>

791
00:42:47.548 --> 00:42:49.948
Thomas met Cody at...

792
00:42:50.382 --> 00:42:51.983
They were doing...

793
00:42:51.986 --> 00:42:54.553
They were both going
for their Bronze Cross.


794
00:42:54.555 --> 00:42:56.355
<i>They were trying
to be lifeguards.</i>


795
00:42:56.356 --> 00:42:59.123
<i>And they were both in the same...</i>

796
00:42:59.125 --> 00:43:01.959
<i>I think they were both in
the same instructor's class.</i>


797
00:43:01.962 --> 00:43:03.595
<i>And they hit it off.</i>

798
00:43:03.596 --> 00:43:07.065
<i>And the next thing I knew,
they were really good friends.</i>


799
00:43:07.667 --> 00:43:11.502
So do you remember how
David met Cody and Thomas?


800
00:43:15.675 --> 00:43:18.010
<i>David met Cody and Thomas</i>

801
00:43:18.610 --> 00:43:20.044
in junior high.

802
00:43:21.247 --> 00:43:22.447
He was, um...

803
00:43:23.383 --> 00:43:25.284
<i>He was always very...</i>

804
00:43:25.285 --> 00:43:27.920
<i>Full of life and mischief and jokes.</i>

805
00:43:29.222 --> 00:43:31.355
<i>He liked to pull
practical jokes on us</i>


806
00:43:31.358 --> 00:43:33.826
and things like that.

807
00:43:34.227 --> 00:43:36.661
<i>I caught them
trying to take the canoe.</i>


808
00:43:36.663 --> 00:43:38.329
<i>And they didn't know
how to use it,</i>


809
00:43:38.331 --> 00:43:39.997
<i>and they weren't wearing
life jackets.</i>


810
00:43:40.965 --> 00:43:42.532
I gave them a rather stern talking to,

811
00:43:42.534 --> 00:43:44.401
and then immediately jumped
in the canoe myself


812
00:43:44.403 --> 00:43:46.169
to show 'em how to do it,

813
00:43:46.173 --> 00:43:47.940
and capsized the canoe.

814
00:43:47.941 --> 00:43:49.475
<i>That's probably the...</i>

815
00:43:50.977 --> 00:43:53.244
<i>That's probably the most
I've ever seen Cody laugh.</i>


816
00:44:12.262 --> 00:44:14.029
<i>The very nature
of a documentary</i>


817
00:44:14.031 --> 00:44:15.998
<i>is truth and reality.</i>

818
00:44:16.001 --> 00:44:17.634
<i>But what truth
are you presenting?</i>


819
00:44:17.636 --> 00:44:20.571
<i>A murderer's, a Judge's, your own?</i>

820
00:44:21.074 --> 00:44:22.506
<i>It's a perception of the truth.</i>

821
00:44:22.508 --> 00:44:23.975
<i>What was the real story?</i>

822
00:44:23.977 --> 00:44:25.075
<i>What really happened?</i>

823
00:44:25.077 --> 00:44:29.312
<i>There was no doubt that
Dwayne's story was heartbreaking.</i>


824
00:44:32.350 --> 00:44:34.951
<i>There was an unrelenting feeling
that something was missing.</i>


825
00:44:36.420 --> 00:44:38.655
<i>It wasn't that
everything didn't add up.</i>


826
00:44:38.657 --> 00:44:40.423
<i>It added up too perfectly.</i>

827
00:44:52.636 --> 00:44:56.039
Yeah, roll it, man.
It's fine. Yeah.


828
00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:58.207
Just come over here for a minute
and watch this. - Okay. What you got?


829
00:44:58.209 --> 00:44:59.275
I want you to see this, man.

830
00:45:00.745 --> 00:45:01.544
Look at this.

831
00:45:01.546 --> 00:45:03.144
<i>When did they
start going up there?</i>


832
00:45:03.146 --> 00:45:06.516
<i>I think Cody and Thomas
were going out there</i>


833
00:45:06.517 --> 00:45:08.684
<i>for a few years
before David joined them.</i>


834
00:45:10.419 --> 00:45:12.820
Did David spend much time
in Yellowstone on his own?


835
00:45:12.822 --> 00:45:15.423
No, he didn't.
I mean, not to our knowledge.


836
00:45:15.426 --> 00:45:18.227
No, he wasn't the outdoors-man
that Cody was.


837
00:45:18.228 --> 00:45:20.762
In Dwayne's confession
he states that it was David


838
00:45:20.766 --> 00:45:22.665
<i>who suggested the site
that they moved to.</i>


839
00:45:24.768 --> 00:45:26.268
<i>I remember that, but...</i>

840
00:45:27.404 --> 00:45:28.470
<i>Like I told Patrick,</i>

841
00:45:28.472 --> 00:45:29.671
<i>that had to be a mistake.</i>

842
00:45:30.508 --> 00:45:32.108
Cody must have suggested it.

843
00:45:32.209 --> 00:45:34.142
I mean, our boy wouldn't have
known to go to that spot.


844
00:45:35.645 --> 00:45:36.712
See?

845
00:45:36.714 --> 00:45:38.547
Dwayne specifically said

846
00:45:38.549 --> 00:45:40.716
that it was David who
suggested that site.


847
00:45:40.717 --> 00:45:42.450
I mean, we've got the..

848
00:45:42.452 --> 00:45:44.318
you know, he could have
gotten the name wrong.


849
00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:46.120
Yeah, then he might not
have as well.


850
00:45:47.589 --> 00:45:50.391
I've got the confession right here.

851
00:45:50.393 --> 00:45:53.728
A transcript of the exact
confession that Dwayne says,


852
00:45:54.130 --> 00:45:57.565
"I was gathering to leave when Dave
suggested something a little different.


853
00:45:59.401 --> 00:46:01.000
About an hour..."
And blah, blah, blah.


854
00:46:01.202 --> 00:46:04.738
"...that Dave stumbled across
a large area of these on previous trips."


855
00:46:05.641 --> 00:46:07.408
"Dave suggested
something a little different."


856
00:46:07.410 --> 00:46:08.808
- That's what Dwayne said.
- Okay.


857
00:46:08.810 --> 00:46:10.812
And everything Dwayne says
is so precise


858
00:46:12.182 --> 00:46:13.315
and so specific.

859
00:46:13.717 --> 00:46:15.451
So, wait. You're thinking
there's a connection


860
00:46:15.454 --> 00:46:16.853
between Dwayne and Dave?

861
00:46:16.854 --> 00:46:18.520
A motive?

862
00:46:18.523 --> 00:46:19.722
I'm just thinking that

863
00:46:19.724 --> 00:46:22.525
everything so far
is so clean and so clear,


864
00:46:23.527 --> 00:46:25.095
and this is really the only whisper

865
00:46:25.097 --> 00:46:26.696
of something that doesn't compute.

866
00:46:31.368 --> 00:46:33.704
So what are we doing at 6:27 am.?

867
00:46:34.606 --> 00:46:36.639
We got a call from Theresa Fitzgerald.

868
00:46:37.508 --> 00:46:39.242
The librarian?

869
00:46:39.243 --> 00:46:40.576
The librarian.

870
00:46:42.245 --> 00:46:46.282
She received a visit last night
as she was closing up,


871
00:46:47.183 --> 00:46:48.617
from Dwayne Nelson.

872
00:46:50.821 --> 00:46:54.057
Theresa hasn't spoken
to anyone in years and years.


873
00:46:54.258 --> 00:46:55.591
And we go to visit her,

874
00:46:56.760 --> 00:46:59.462
and a few days later,
suddenly Dwayne shows up?


875
00:47:00.866 --> 00:47:02.233
You think he's following us?

876
00:47:03.367 --> 00:47:04.868
Well, obviously he knows about us

877
00:47:04.870 --> 00:47:06.703
and he's worried about something.

878
00:47:06.705 --> 00:47:08.338
He definitely worried
about something.


879
00:47:11.207 --> 00:47:13.208
I don't know if
there's that much to tell.


880
00:47:15.646 --> 00:47:18.248
So did you feel threatened
at all when he came in?


881
00:47:18.250 --> 00:47:19.315
Oh, no.

882
00:47:19.317 --> 00:47:20.583
No, he's very polite.

883
00:47:20.585 --> 00:47:22.652
It was just a shock.

884
00:47:22.654 --> 00:47:24.787
But he did ask you if you'd
been talking to anyone?


885
00:47:24.788 --> 00:47:25.686
Yeah, he did.

886
00:47:25.688 --> 00:47:28.757
And I told him
about the documentary,


887
00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:32.662
but after all, I only really talked about
Carol when you interviewed me.


888
00:47:34.431 --> 00:47:35.832
See, what's weird is that

889
00:47:35.834 --> 00:47:38.368
I've contacted everyone
we interviewed,


890
00:47:38.370 --> 00:47:41.171
and Dwayne hasn't tried to
get a hold of any of them.


891
00:47:41.172 --> 00:47:43.672
So I'm wondering
what I'm missing here.


892
00:47:45.509 --> 00:47:46.809
I don't know.

893
00:47:46.810 --> 00:47:48.844
I don't know if there's
anything more to tell.


894
00:47:48.846 --> 00:47:51.580
He came in in the morning,
left at night.


895
00:47:51.582 --> 00:47:52.848
I told him he could...

896
00:47:53.615 --> 00:47:55.883
Sign out anything he wanted,

897
00:47:55.885 --> 00:47:58.586
but he said he preferred
to be in the library.


898
00:47:58.588 --> 00:48:00.955
Was that to be closer to
his wife, do you think?


899
00:48:00.958 --> 00:48:03.859
- Oh, I assumed so.
- Yeah?


900
00:48:03.861 --> 00:48:05.928
The only other people
spent that much time here


901
00:48:05.930 --> 00:48:08.197
are students doing research.

902
00:48:08.630 --> 00:48:09.630
Right.

903
00:48:12.501 --> 00:48:14.602
Did he ever take any of the books
home that he was reading?


904
00:48:14.771 --> 00:48:16.205
Uh, nope.

905
00:48:16.206 --> 00:48:17.572
Not that I can remember.

906
00:48:17.575 --> 00:48:19.241
And if you don't check a book out,

907
00:48:19.243 --> 00:48:20.709
is there any record
of what you've been reading?


908
00:48:21.344 --> 00:48:22.978
No, of course not.

909
00:48:22.980 --> 00:48:24.680
Do you have any idea
what he was reading?


910
00:48:25.747 --> 00:48:27.915
Like I said, he just
sat in the back.


911
00:48:29.786 --> 00:48:30.953
Where was that again?

912
00:48:30.955 --> 00:48:32.254
Over in the corner there.

913
00:48:32.256 --> 00:48:32.854
Okay.

914
00:48:35.992 --> 00:48:38.227
<i>Why did Dwayne come back now?</i>

915
00:48:38.860 --> 00:48:40.494
<i>According to Theresa,</i>

916
00:48:40.496 --> 00:48:41.794
<i>he stopped visiting the library</i>

917
00:48:41.796 --> 00:48:43.564
<i>about a year before
he committed the murders,</i>


918
00:48:43.566 --> 00:48:45.299
<i>and had never been back since.</i>

919
00:48:46.401 --> 00:48:47.802
<i>So what was he doing here?</i>

920
00:48:49.605 --> 00:48:51.706
<i>The answer was staring
me in the face.</i>


921
00:48:52.474 --> 00:48:53.975
Adam...

922
00:48:56.010 --> 00:48:57.578
<i>Something so obvious,</i>

923
00:48:58.080 --> 00:48:59.479
<i>I'd missed it on the first visit.</i>

924
00:49:04.019 --> 00:49:06.018
<i>Of course he was looking
at the law books, man.</i>


925
00:49:06.020 --> 00:49:08.256
What else are you gonna do
in your local library law section?


926
00:49:08.257 --> 00:49:10.023
You don't go to the library,

927
00:49:10.025 --> 00:49:12.525
hoping to find an overlap
in the Constitution.


928
00:49:12.527 --> 00:49:14.794
I mean, one that will allow
you to get way with murder?


929
00:49:14.797 --> 00:49:16.564
No, you don't.

930
00:49:16.566 --> 00:49:18.432
But he must have known about
this loophole beforehand.


931
00:49:19.568 --> 00:49:20.935
Otherwise, it's just what he says.

932
00:49:20.937 --> 00:49:22.836
It's a bunch of, you know, coincidences

933
00:49:22.838 --> 00:49:24.004
that let a guilty man go free.

934
00:49:24.105 --> 00:49:26.039
But, Julian, there are
a ton of cases


935
00:49:26.041 --> 00:49:28.475
where people have gotten off
on ridiculous technicalities.


936
00:49:28.877 --> 00:49:30.577
Yeah, but if we find a motive,

937
00:49:30.579 --> 00:49:32.946
then we can prove Dwayne
orchestrated the entire thing.


938
00:49:32.948 --> 00:49:34.681
Presuming there's one to be found.

939
00:49:37.586 --> 00:49:39.420
It's like what Matcek said, man.

940
00:49:40.454 --> 00:49:42.656
It's not a guy who's crazy.

941
00:49:42.658 --> 00:49:44.024
He's in complete control.

942
00:49:45.326 --> 00:49:47.794
Patrick, sorry to bother you again,

943
00:49:47.796 --> 00:49:50.697
but I just got back
from the Williston Library,


944
00:49:50.699 --> 00:49:52.900
and it seems Dwayne
was just there.


945
00:49:53.701 --> 00:49:56.635
I also found out that Dwayne
spent a lot of time there


946
00:49:56.637 --> 00:49:58.637
before the murders,
in the law section.


947
00:49:59.875 --> 00:50:01.808
I mean, he was looking
at law books.


948
00:50:01.809 --> 00:50:03.342
He was doing research there.

949
00:50:03.344 --> 00:50:05.477
Doesn't that indicate
some sort of premeditation,


950
00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:07.547
or a motive, or something suspicious?

951
00:50:16.524 --> 00:50:17.691
Okay, but he comes out of hiding,

952
00:50:17.693 --> 00:50:19.359
and he goes directly
back to the library?


953
00:50:19.361 --> 00:50:20.760
Isn't that also suspicious?

954
00:50:30.870 --> 00:50:32.371
Okay, no. Patrick, I get that.

955
00:50:32.373 --> 00:50:33.972
But can I just ask you
another question here?


956
00:50:38.345 --> 00:50:39.745
<i>There had to be a motive.</i>

957
00:50:39.747 --> 00:50:42.482
<i>There had to be a link between
Dwayne and one of the boys.</i>


958
00:50:43.384 --> 00:50:44.950
<i>I kept coming back
to David Drabeck.</i>


959
00:50:45.986 --> 00:50:46.885
<i>According to Dwayne,</i>

960
00:50:46.987 --> 00:50:50.757
<i>he was the one that took them all
to the so called "zone of death."</i>


961
00:50:51.059 --> 00:50:53.093
<i>I hope David's mother
might have some answers.</i>


962
00:50:54.394 --> 00:50:56.228
Any connection maybe
through construction?


963
00:51:09.042 --> 00:51:10.343
One more quick question.

964
00:51:11.445 --> 00:51:14.914
Um, did David ever go to
North Dakota for any reason?


965
00:51:15.117 --> 00:51:16.883
Have any friends or family up there?

966
00:51:30.932 --> 00:51:32.767
And who are we talking
about, Mrs. Drabeck?


967
00:51:47.048 --> 00:51:48.149
What was her name?

968
00:51:53.053 --> 00:51:54.954
Mrs. Drabeck, would you be able

969
00:51:54.956 --> 00:51:56.523
to send me that letter,
do you think?


970
00:51:57.792 --> 00:52:00.560
Earlier today, I got this
letter from Nancy Drabeck.


971
00:52:01.462 --> 00:52:03.530
She sent me the letter

972
00:52:03.532 --> 00:52:05.432
that Kayleigh Brighton sent her

973
00:52:05.434 --> 00:52:06.633
now Kayleigh Brighton...

974
00:52:08.802 --> 00:52:11.470
Is not a photographer.
Kayleigh Brighton...


975
00:52:11.472 --> 00:52:13.639
Is an Environmental Biologist,

976
00:52:15.143 --> 00:52:18.513
at a University that happens
to be right above North Dakota.


977
00:52:18.815 --> 00:52:21.215
Come around here, man.
Check this out.


978
00:52:21.217 --> 00:52:23.751
I typed in Kayleigh's address
earlier today.


979
00:52:24.885 --> 00:52:28.655
And she lives right above
Regina, Saskatchewan.


980
00:52:29.689 --> 00:52:32.057
The three boys are from Rapid City.

981
00:52:32.726 --> 00:52:34.794
Check out this route.

982
00:52:34.796 --> 00:52:36.629
Look at that.
Right in the middle.


983
00:52:36.630 --> 00:52:38.931
Williston, Dwayne's hometown,
right where we are.


984
00:52:41.634 --> 00:52:43.035
You're ready for a road trip, buddy?

985
00:52:46.740 --> 00:52:48.875
What are you hoping to find?

986
00:52:48.877 --> 00:52:51.678
There's a missing link
between Dave and Dwayne.


987
00:52:51.979 --> 00:52:53.879
And I know this girl's got
some answers for us.


988
00:52:53.881 --> 00:52:55.681
Do you realise how
ridiculous this sounds?


989
00:52:55.683 --> 00:52:57.216
This one girl?

990
00:52:57.518 --> 00:52:59.618
And what does this have to
do with Dwayne and Dave anyways?


991
00:52:59.619 --> 00:53:00.952
Well, you saw the map.

992
00:53:00.955 --> 00:53:02.821
And I've just got
a good feeling about it.


993
00:53:02.823 --> 00:53:04.089
What do you think she'll tell you?

994
00:53:05.625 --> 00:53:07.092
I have no idea, man.

995
00:53:08.827 --> 00:53:11.195
But I have three hours and

996
00:53:12.064 --> 00:53:13.564
She knows something.

997
00:53:52.271 --> 00:53:53.938
I can't see anything in there.

998
00:53:54.973 --> 00:53:56.140
Whoa.

999
00:53:56.142 --> 00:53:57.608
It's a fucking pig, man.

1000
00:53:59.110 --> 00:54:00.243
Look at this.

1001
00:54:02.848 --> 00:54:05.716
Hey man, we're looking
for Kayleigh Brighton, actually.


1002
00:54:08.219 --> 00:54:09.920
What's the camera for?

1003
00:54:09.922 --> 00:54:12.656
Well, we're just hoping to talk
to Kayleigh here for a second.


1004
00:54:12.659 --> 00:54:14.358
What do you wanna talk
to my wife for?


1005
00:54:14.359 --> 00:54:15.625
Listen, man,
we drove a long way.


1006
00:54:15.628 --> 00:54:17.828
I'm just wondering if I could
talk to Kayleigh for a second.


1007
00:54:17.830 --> 00:54:19.030
Shut your camera off.

1008
00:54:19.033 --> 00:54:21.233
Okay. But is she here?
Is she... she your wife?


1009
00:54:21.234 --> 00:54:22.300
- Shut your camera off.
- Hey, man.


1010
00:54:22.302 --> 00:54:23.668
Listen. Hey, hey, buddy. Hey.

1011
00:54:23.670 --> 00:54:24.969
It's up to her, you understand?

1012
00:54:24.971 --> 00:54:26.637
Okay, buddy.

1013
00:54:26.739 --> 00:54:28.639
I don't want you going up there
shoving a camera in her face.


1014
00:54:28.640 --> 00:54:31.307
Also, you know, when you go up there,
you make sure that camera's off.


1015
00:54:32.611 --> 00:54:34.211
I'm sorry what
happened to the guys.


1016
00:54:34.213 --> 00:54:36.080
But the thing is we don't
have the Internet here.


1017
00:54:36.081 --> 00:54:39.383
We didn't. So I just heard
about it on the radio.


1018
00:54:39.585 --> 00:54:40.984
That's how we heard about it.

1019
00:54:40.986 --> 00:54:42.686
- Right.
- But we...


1020
00:54:42.689 --> 00:54:45.256
My parents let me know.
And it was a tragedy.


1021
00:54:45.258 --> 00:54:47.159
Definitely devastating.

1022
00:54:47.961 --> 00:54:50.595
I mean, I just can't believe
that happened.


1023
00:54:50.997 --> 00:54:52.930
Yeah, it's a real shock
I'm sure, to hear that


1024
00:54:52.932 --> 00:54:54.165
- about a friend.
- Yeah.


1025
00:54:54.167 --> 00:54:55.633
So, okay.

1026
00:54:55.635 --> 00:54:57.268
You got me alone.

1027
00:54:57.270 --> 00:54:59.136
I don't even know what
you're looking for though.


1028
00:54:59.137 --> 00:55:01.037
I mean, to be honest,
I don't know what I'm looking for either.


1029
00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:02.239
I'm just chasing every lead.

1030
00:55:03.175 --> 00:55:05.443
But you have no idea

1031
00:55:06.277 --> 00:55:07.744
about who Dwayne is, or...

1032
00:55:07.846 --> 00:55:10.046
No, I have no idea. I'm sorry.

1033
00:55:10.048 --> 00:55:11.781
With, um...

1034
00:55:11.784 --> 00:55:14.352
With David, we worked
at camp together,


1035
00:55:14.353 --> 00:55:15.851
we hung out with the same friends.

1036
00:55:15.853 --> 00:55:19.789
And I might have been
with him for 10 days total.


1037
00:55:19.792 --> 00:55:21.959
And you guys never had
a relationship or anything like that?


1038
00:55:22.061 --> 00:55:24.195
No, we were just friends, that's it.

1039
00:56:05.869 --> 00:56:07.336
All right, Julian,
let's get you miked up.


1040
00:56:07.904 --> 00:56:08.971
Here you go.

1041
00:56:11.809 --> 00:56:13.076
What are you doing with this?

1042
00:56:13.077 --> 00:56:14.243
I watched this a bunch of times.

1043
00:56:14.245 --> 00:56:15.911
I know there's something...

1044
00:56:16.314 --> 00:56:18.014
She's like..

1045
00:56:18.016 --> 00:56:19.282
She's hiding something for sure.

1046
00:56:19.284 --> 00:56:20.684
Dude, you're reaching, man.

1047
00:56:20.685 --> 00:56:22.051
Everything checks out.

1048
00:56:24.856 --> 00:56:26.856
It's off, man.
Something's wrong with this.


1049
00:56:26.858 --> 00:56:28.892
Come on, man. It's a dead end.
You know it is.


1050
00:56:30.027 --> 00:56:31.695
Here, take this.
We got work to do.


1051
00:56:36.066 --> 00:56:38.934
<i>Sometimes, when you're searching
for something so hard,</i>


1052
00:56:39.136 --> 00:56:40.903
<i>you'll connect the dots
with wavy lines</i>


1053
00:56:41.007 --> 00:56:43.307
<i>and convince yourself
they're straight.</i>


1054
00:56:43.308 --> 00:56:45.241
<i>Sometimes they just don't
connect at all.</i>


1055
00:56:50.448 --> 00:56:52.282
There's Patrick right there.

1056
00:57:00.058 --> 00:57:01.792
- How you doing?
- Okay, good. You?


1057
00:57:01.794 --> 00:57:03.060
Listen...

1058
00:57:03.062 --> 00:57:04.995
Could I see those case files
for a moment?


1059
00:57:04.996 --> 00:57:06.429
I can't give you those case files.

1060
00:57:06.431 --> 00:57:08.231
I could look at them in your
office if you want, even.


1061
00:57:08.233 --> 00:57:10.200
I'm sorry,
but they're private files.


1062
00:57:10.203 --> 00:57:12.136
I know they're private files, Patrick.

1063
00:57:12.138 --> 00:57:14.438
But could I just look at them,
maybe for a second? - Sorry, I'm late.


1064
00:57:14.439 --> 00:57:16.137
I know there's something
in there, man.


1065
00:57:16.139 --> 00:57:18.874
Patrick, maybe I can schedule
something with your assistant?


1066
00:57:18.978 --> 00:57:20.077
Patrick!

1067
00:57:36.093 --> 00:57:39.529
<i>I had actually accomplished what
I had originally set out to do,</i>


1068
00:57:39.831 --> 00:57:41.931
<i>which was to document
this bizarre murder case.</i>


1069
00:57:43.833 --> 00:57:45.100
<i>My opinions had changed,</i>

1070
00:57:45.103 --> 00:57:47.003
<i>but a theory is just speculation.</i>

1071
00:57:50.440 --> 00:57:52.207
<i>Without proof,</i>

1072
00:57:52.209 --> 00:57:53.275
<i>without an interview,</i>

1073
00:57:53.277 --> 00:57:55.277
<i>without any shred of motive,</i>

1074
00:57:55.279 --> 00:57:58.046
<i>I was left staring at the obvious.</i>

1075
00:57:58.047 --> 00:58:00.047
<i>This was simply
a freak occurrence,</i>


1076
00:58:00.051 --> 00:58:01.317
<i>nothing more.</i>

1077
00:58:11.562 --> 00:58:12.996
Adam?

1078
00:58:16.967 --> 00:58:18.434
- Adam.
- What?


1079
00:58:18.436 --> 00:58:20.036
Look at this.
We got a package, man.


1080
00:58:20.037 --> 00:58:21.303
- Wake up.
- What is it?


1081
00:58:22.038 --> 00:58:23.238
Wake up. Come on.

1082
00:58:23.240 --> 00:58:24.540
Come on, I'm trying to sleep.

1083
00:58:25.074 --> 00:58:26.241
Take this.

1084
00:58:26.243 --> 00:58:27.876
Adam, here. Come on.

1085
00:58:27.877 --> 00:58:29.377
Take the camera. Let's go.

1086
00:58:29.845 --> 00:58:31.045
Come on.

1087
00:58:32.449 --> 00:58:34.050
- You rolling.
- It's rolling.


1088
00:58:43.092 --> 00:58:44.159
There's nothing in this.

1089
00:58:44.161 --> 00:58:45.194
It's a joke?

1090
00:59:00.210 --> 00:59:01.343
Do you have a phone on you?

1091
00:59:02.078 --> 00:59:03.212
I do.

1092
00:59:21.130 --> 00:59:22.431
There's two videos here.

1093
00:59:30.306 --> 00:59:31.573
<i>Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.</i>

1094
00:59:35.011 --> 00:59:36.578
<i>I wanna get one with all of you.</i>

1095
00:59:38.081 --> 00:59:39.281
<i>All right. Come on, you guys.</i>

1096
00:59:39.283 --> 00:59:40.549
<i>- Yeah?
- Yeah.</i>


1097
00:59:40.551 --> 00:59:41.684
Oh.

1098
00:59:41.985 --> 00:59:43.251
This is something.

1099
00:59:43.253 --> 00:59:44.251
<i>- Good?
- Yeah, great.</i>


1100
00:59:44.253 --> 00:59:46.887
<i>It's the annual Yellowstone
Boys' Weekend.</i>


1101
00:59:46.923 --> 00:59:48.290
<i>All right?</i>

1102
00:59:50.559 --> 00:59:51.926
Wild.

1103
00:59:53.662 --> 00:59:55.229
Who the fuck got this?

1104
01:00:13.115 --> 01:00:14.181
Ooh!

1105
01:00:26.661 --> 01:00:28.094
Holy shit.

1106
01:00:35.169 --> 01:00:36.336
<i>No, no, no.</i>

1107
01:00:36.338 --> 01:00:37.437
<i>No, no!</i>

1108
01:00:38.441 --> 01:00:39.407
Holy fuck!

1109
01:00:46.415 --> 01:00:48.382
Ad, who the fuck
dropped this off, man?


1110
01:00:51.585 --> 01:00:52.619
Let's figure this out.

1111
01:01:02.697 --> 01:01:05.565
Here. Right here.

1112
01:01:05.566 --> 01:01:07.466
Let's go down to the front desk...

1113
01:01:17.412 --> 01:01:19.080
- Hello, sir.
- Hi.


1114
01:01:19.081 --> 01:01:20.613
- How are you?
- I'm good.


1115
01:01:20.615 --> 01:01:22.015
Can I ask a big favour of you?

1116
01:01:22.750 --> 01:01:24.317
There.

1117
01:01:24.319 --> 01:01:25.986
- So this is this morning?
- Yeah.


1118
01:01:25.987 --> 01:01:28.187
Okay. That's 5:15.

1119
01:01:28.189 --> 01:01:30.322
- Yeah, there he is.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.


1120
01:01:30.325 --> 01:01:32.058
He's gonna come out over there.

1121
01:01:34.995 --> 01:01:36.195
See?

1122
01:01:37.130 --> 01:01:38.263
And this is my door here?

1123
01:01:38.265 --> 01:01:39.398
Yeah.

1124
01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:40.733
That's Number 15.

1125
01:01:46.607 --> 01:01:47.774
Who the fuck is that?

1126
01:01:56.115 --> 01:01:57.582
You don't have any other..

1127
01:01:57.586 --> 01:01:59.152
nothing where we can
see someone's face?


1128
01:01:59.154 --> 01:02:01.554
You might catch his face on the other...

1129
01:02:03.324 --> 01:02:04.491
Who is that?

1130
01:02:06.661 --> 01:02:08.129
Is it Dwayne?

1131
01:02:19.641 --> 01:02:21.075
<i>All right. This good?</i>

1132
01:02:21.077 --> 01:02:21.975
<i>Yeah, it's great.</i>

1133
01:02:21.977 --> 01:02:24.612
<i>I watched the videos
for two days straight,</i>


1134
01:02:24.614 --> 01:02:26.080
<i>and I didn't catch anything.</i>

1135
01:02:27.681 --> 01:02:30.650
<i>But then, anything in life
can be fascinating</i>


1136
01:02:30.653 --> 01:02:32.319
<i>when you delve into the details.</i>

1137
01:02:37.759 --> 01:02:39.493
The director,

1138
01:02:40.494 --> 01:02:41.661
the crew.

1139
01:02:43.799 --> 01:02:45.599
Kraft services...

1140
01:02:49.171 --> 01:02:52.006
And beautiful America.

1141
01:02:53.341 --> 01:02:54.842
Come here.

1142
01:02:54.844 --> 01:02:56.510
- Come here.
- What do you need?


1143
01:02:56.511 --> 01:02:58.378
Set up the camera
over here and look at this.


1144
01:02:58.380 --> 01:02:59.579
All right, all right, hold on.

1145
01:03:01.383 --> 01:03:02.683
- Quit fucking around.
- I'm coming, dude.


1146
01:03:02.685 --> 01:03:04.251
Put that down and look at this.
Check it out.


1147
01:03:05.854 --> 01:03:07.288
You gotta see this.

1148
01:03:07.290 --> 01:03:09.156
Yeah. All right.
What am I looking at?


1149
01:03:09.158 --> 01:03:10.458
Just leave that alone for now..

1150
01:03:10.459 --> 01:03:11.257
Yes, yes.

1151
01:03:11.259 --> 01:03:13.161
Look at this, look at this.
You gotta see this.


1152
01:03:14.563 --> 01:03:17.097
- What am I supposed to be looking at?
- What's that?


1153
01:03:17.101 --> 01:03:18.567
- See that logo right there?
- Yeah, on his jacket.


1154
01:03:18.568 --> 01:03:19.900
- Yeah, have you seen that before?
- No.


1155
01:03:19.902 --> 01:03:21.202
You've seen that before.

1156
01:03:21.204 --> 01:03:22.236
- Okay.
- Look.


1157
01:03:23.772 --> 01:03:25.639
At Dwayne's house,
which is right here...


1158
01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:27.107
Look at this.

1159
01:03:31.847 --> 01:03:34.448
What's that right there?
That's the same logo.


1160
01:03:34.449 --> 01:03:35.648
Yeah, what's that?

1161
01:03:35.650 --> 01:03:36.816
That's a water filtration system

1162
01:03:36.818 --> 01:03:38.585
that every house in this area has.

1163
01:03:38.587 --> 01:03:40.220
It's the same company, man.

1164
01:03:40.221 --> 01:03:41.687
- It's ENRG. Look at this.
- Whoa, whoa.


1165
01:03:41.689 --> 01:03:42.923
"ENRG."

1166
01:03:44.724 --> 01:03:45.791
So?

1167
01:03:45.894 --> 01:03:47.660
That's the same company, man.
ENRG.


1168
01:03:47.662 --> 01:03:48.761
It's a fracking company.

1169
01:03:51.165 --> 01:03:54.401
Jesus! That's Cody's dad, man.

1170
01:03:55.202 --> 01:03:56.502
We might have just
found the motive.


1171
01:04:02.609 --> 01:04:03.809
Raymond fucking Gibbs.

1172
01:04:04.845 --> 01:04:05.879
Wait, wait, wait.

1173
01:04:07.414 --> 01:04:09.649
The CEO of ENRG, USA

1174
01:04:11.584 --> 01:04:13.483
We were looking at
the wrong guy the whole time.


1175
01:04:13.685 --> 01:04:16.488
<i>The City of Williston has
avoided the current economic crisis</i>


1176
01:04:16.791 --> 01:04:18.358
<i>due largely to the success</i>

1177

<i>of an old fashioned oil boom.</i>

<i>Improvements in drilling technology</i>

1179

of hydraulic fracturing,</i>


1180
01:04:25.599 --> 01:04:27.666
<i>otherwise known as "fracking."</i>

1181
01:04:27.668 --> 01:04:30.636
<i>It's a controversial process,</i>

1182
01:04:30.639 --> 01:04:32.839
<i>but it's used in abundance
in North Dakota,</i>


1183
01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:35.107
<i>specifically in Williston.</i>

1184
01:04:35.609 --> 01:04:37.809
<i>Fracking is a destructive process</i>

1185
01:04:37.811 --> 01:04:40.312
<i>that is used to extract natural gas</i>

<i>from rock that lies
deep underground.</i>


1187
01:04:43.916 --> 01:04:45.583
<i>A well is drilled,</i>

1188
01:04:45.586 --> 01:04:47.920
<i>and millions of gallons
of toxic fluid</i>


1189
01:04:47.921 --> 01:04:49.520
<i>is injected.</i>

1190
01:04:49.522 --> 01:04:52.590
<i>A mix of water,
sand and chemicals,</i>


1191

<i>at a high enough pressure

1192
01:04:54.761 --> 01:04:56.194
<i>and release the gas.</i>

1193
01:04:57.362 --> 01:04:58.896
<i>Fracking is currently exempt</i>

1194

<i>from major environmental laws,</i>

1195

<i>including the Safe
Drinking Water Act.</i>


1196
01:05:03.736 --> 01:05:07.405
<i>Toxic spills and gas leaks
are far too common.</i>


1197
01:05:07.908 --> 01:05:10.409
<i>It's a process that destroys our land</i>

1198
01:05:10.410 --> 01:05:12.243
<i>and puts us all at risk.</i>

1199
01:05:13.979 --> 01:05:16.247
<i>I recently filmed a documentary</i>

1200
01:05:16.250 --> 01:05:17.883
"Trouble in the Peace".

1201
01:05:17.884 --> 01:05:20.585
<i>In it, I examined this
very same issue</i>

<i>in a small farming town

<i>A single father's struggles

<i>from the dangers that

<i>have brought to his community.</i>

1206
01:05:31.231 --> 01:05:32.731
<i>It's difficult. And yeah,</i>

1207
01:05:32.732 --> 01:05:34.632
<i>sometimes it's really discouraging</i>

1208
01:05:34.634 --> 01:05:35.766
<i>and we think...</i>

1209
01:05:37.336 --> 01:05:38.836
<i>Why bother anymore?</i>

1210
01:05:44.342 --> 01:05:47.744
<i>And it's... I don't know.
I don't wanna be a coward.</i>


1211

<i>during pregnancy.</i>

1218
01:06:30.689 --> 01:06:33.291
<i>Was all this just a coincidence?</i>

1219
01:06:33.293 --> 01:06:36.360
<i>Or were these murders
an elaborate act</i>


1220
01:06:36.362 --> 01:06:37.695

1230
01:07:19.473 --> 01:07:21.073
Like a double jeopardy
or something like that?


1231
01:07:26.611 --> 01:07:27.812
What's "empanelled" mean?

1232
01:07:34.687 --> 01:07:36.455
But with a motive, then..

1233
01:07:49.568 --> 01:07:50.634
Holy shit. Okay.

1234
01:07:55.573 --> 01:07:57.974
Yeah, unless he gave us
that footage out of guilt,


1235
01:07:57.976 --> 01:07:59.476
and he wants to confess.

1236
01:08:06.786 --> 01:08:08.520
Okay, thanks a lot,
Patrick, I appreciate it.


1237
01:08:08.521 --> 01:08:09.754
Like hell.

1238
01:08:09.756 --> 01:08:11.422
What do you mean?

1239
01:08:11.424 --> 01:08:13.824
Like hell we're gonna give
the footage to the authorities


1240
01:08:13.826 --> 01:08:16.327
- and let them handle..
- we're gonna give the footage to the authorities.


1241
01:08:16.595 --> 01:08:17.695
"We" who?

1242
01:08:17.697 --> 01:08:19.530
Us. You and I.

1243
01:08:19.532 --> 01:08:20.865
We're gonna do
the Dwayne interview


1244
01:08:20.867 --> 01:08:22.466
because we have
the opportunity to do it.


1245
01:08:22.468 --> 01:08:23.934
If you do this, I'm walking.

1246
01:08:23.935 --> 01:08:26.035
But we're here to do
the Dwayne interview.


1247
01:08:26.037 --> 01:08:27.904
That's the whole point of this story.

1248
01:08:27.906 --> 01:08:29.706
Get the fuck out of my way.

1249
01:08:30.709 --> 01:08:32.176
Fuck off.

1250
01:08:32.178 --> 01:08:34.812
- Come on, soldier.
- Yeah, yeah. This is insane, dude.


1251
01:08:34.814 --> 01:08:35.913
What do you mean this is insane?

1252
01:08:35.915 --> 01:08:37.114
This is what we came here for, man.

1253
01:08:37.116 --> 01:08:38.949
Do you realise
the guy is following us,


1254
01:08:38.950 --> 01:08:40.750
and he's a murderer?

1255
01:08:40.752 --> 01:08:42.519
We came here with a purpose.

1256
01:08:42.521 --> 01:08:44.020
We are following a story.

1257
01:08:44.022 --> 01:08:45.155
A purpose to stay alive.

1258
01:08:45.158 --> 01:08:46.791
You heard Patrick, all right.

1259
01:08:46.792 --> 01:08:48.158
If he admits to a motive,

1260
01:08:48.160 --> 01:08:49.692
he's not protected anymore.

1261
01:08:49.694 --> 01:08:51.661
So we're gonna walk away now
after all this time?


1262
01:08:51.663 --> 01:08:52.829
Yeah, we're sitting ducks.

1263
01:08:52.831 --> 01:08:53.997
We came all this fucking way.

1264
01:08:53.998 --> 01:08:55.464
You know what? Fuck you.

1265
01:08:56.065 --> 01:08:57.566
Stop being a pussy.

1266
01:09:07.212 --> 01:09:10.114
<i>Things finally started
to makes sense.</i>


1267
01:09:10.115 --> 01:09:12.582
<i>The more I thought about
all the events,</i>


1268
01:09:12.584 --> 01:09:15.885
<i>the more I began to comprehend
how Dwayne got away with murder.</i>


1269
01:09:19.023 --> 01:09:21.925
<i>There was the connection
to Raymond Gibbs and his son.</i>


1270
01:09:21.927 --> 01:09:24.127
<i>But Dwayne killed three boys.</i>

1271
01:09:24.228 --> 01:09:25.961
<i>That was the scary part.</i>

1272
01:09:25.963 --> 01:09:27.996
<i>Ingeniously scary.</i>

1273
01:09:27.998 --> 01:09:29.598
<i>If he killed Cody alone,</i>

1274
01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:32.534
<i>it's far easier to draw
the lines together.</i>


1275
01:09:32.536 --> 01:09:34.470
<i>So he diluted the motive.</i>

1276
01:09:34.472 --> 01:09:37.173
<i>Kill Cody, you have murder
and motive.</i>


1277
01:09:37.476 --> 01:09:41.010
<i>Kill them all, it's a random
act of violent insanity.</i>


1278
01:09:48.952 --> 01:09:50.986
<i>Adam did have a point.</i>

1279
01:09:50.988 --> 01:09:53.222
<i>I decided to take a copy
of the footage</i>


1280
01:09:53.223 --> 01:09:56.057
<i>and a letter to the cops,
in case anything happened.</i>


1281
01:10:02.499 --> 01:10:04.233
<i>When I started this documentary,</i>

1282
01:10:04.235 --> 01:10:07.135
<i>it was a passion project
based on a crazy story.</i>


1283
01:10:07.138 --> 01:10:09.772
<i>It's not a story, it's a tragedy.</i>

1284
01:10:09.773 --> 01:10:12.007
<i>But I never thought
it would lead to this.</i>


1285
01:10:12.009 --> 01:10:14.276
<i>I never though I would
fear for my life.</i>


1286
01:10:15.578 --> 01:10:17.279
That's it, right there.

1287
01:10:29.191 --> 01:10:31.058
When I get there,
shut that down.


1288
01:10:31.995 --> 01:10:33.996
He was very,
very adamant about...


1289
01:10:36.599 --> 01:10:38.967
The fact that he'll tell us
where to set up and what to do.


1290
01:10:41.771 --> 01:10:42.771
You all right?

1291
01:10:42.773 --> 01:10:43.939
I'm fine.

1292
01:10:44.707 --> 01:10:45.475
Okay.

1293
01:10:46.577 --> 01:10:47.709
I know you don't wanna be here.

1294
01:10:47.711 --> 01:10:48.844
Dude, I'm fine.

1295
01:10:54.116 --> 01:10:55.950
Jesus! Where the fuck
does this man live?


1296
01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:05.561
All right. Shut it off.

1297
01:11:06.629 --> 01:11:07.796
Let's do this.

1298
01:11:13.169 --> 01:11:14.603
Where's your camera guy?

1299
01:11:14.605 --> 01:11:15.704
It's just me and you.

1300
01:11:19.809 --> 01:11:20.976
Okay.

1301
01:11:23.845 --> 01:11:25.179
This isn't an interview, is it?

1302
01:11:29.951 --> 01:11:31.585
No, it's not.

1303
01:11:33.055 --> 01:11:34.221
- Where is your son?
- Oh...


1304
01:11:40.127 --> 01:11:42.095
Just leave my son out of this.

1305
01:11:44.665 --> 01:11:45.999
Okay, you've got something to say,

1306
01:11:46.002 --> 01:11:47.335
so why don't you just say it?

1307
01:11:47.337 --> 01:11:48.769
You don't need me here.

1308
01:11:50.272 --> 01:11:51.472
It's not true. 
I do need you.

1309
01:11:52.106 --> 01:11:53.507
Why?

1310
01:11:53.909 --> 01:11:55.642
I think that if you see something

1311
01:11:57.412 --> 01:11:59.379
that is completely wrong and unjust,

1312
01:12:01.116 --> 01:12:02.851
you have a philosophical

1313
01:12:03.753 --> 01:12:05.753
moral obligation
to speak up against it,


1314
01:12:05.755 --> 01:12:07.021
even if you cannot change it.

1315
01:12:10.324 --> 01:12:12.125
You've seen my film.

1316
01:12:15.697 --> 01:12:16.764
Yeah.

1317
01:12:18.967 --> 01:12:20.201
I've seen a lot of things, Julian.

1318
01:12:22.003 --> 01:12:23.169
And nothing's changed.

1319
01:12:23.171 --> 01:12:24.371
But an eye for an eye?

1320
01:12:25.306 --> 01:12:26.640
Is that really your answer?

1321
01:12:27.241 --> 01:12:28.708
Are you even now with Raymond?

1322
01:12:28.712 --> 01:12:29.978
Oh...

1323
01:12:31.114 --> 01:12:32.148
If...

1324
01:12:33.150 --> 01:12:35.817
If a child is ripped away
from you like that...


1325
01:12:38.353 --> 01:12:40.087
There's no replacing it.

1326
01:12:41.857 --> 01:12:43.124
There's no eye for an eye.

1327
01:12:46.195 --> 01:12:48.096
But you are a murderer now.

1328
01:12:49.198 --> 01:12:50.765
I didn't ask to
be a part of it.

1329
01:12:54.069 --> 01:12:55.202
But as I man,

1330
01:12:58.908 --> 01:13:01.343
as a husband and as a father,
you do what's necessary.


1331
01:13:09.017 --> 01:13:10.918
You found it necessary

1332
01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:13.087
to kill three innocent boys?

1333
01:13:15.290 --> 01:13:17.158
These people get away
with murder every day.


1334
01:13:19.962 --> 01:13:21.463
Hell, you made documentaries
about it.


1335
01:13:24.366 --> 01:13:26.133
But you're just sitting there...

1336
01:13:26.135 --> 01:13:27.568
You're sitting there
and you're judging me,


1337
01:13:27.570 --> 01:13:28.669
just like everyone else.

1338
01:13:29.470 --> 01:13:30.904
Those people, they...

1339
01:13:32.441 --> 01:13:33.908
They manipulate the laws.

1340
01:13:36.877 --> 01:13:38.712
And you can speak up, you can...

1341
01:13:39.313 --> 01:13:40.246
You can protest.

1342
01:13:42.483 --> 01:13:43.483
It doesn't matter.

1343
01:13:46.854 --> 01:13:48.955
I'm just the first guy to play their...

1344
01:13:48.958 --> 01:13:50.057
Their game by their rules.

1345
01:13:51.792 --> 01:13:53.326
Are you saying that you planned

1346
01:13:53.328 --> 01:13:55.895
and carried out the murder
of Raymond Gibbs' son?


1347
01:13:55.897 --> 01:13:57.397
Julian, I'm saying

1348
01:13:57.400 --> 01:13:59.500
Raymond Gibbs hasn't
suffered enough.


1349
01:14:02.504 --> 01:14:03.838
It still doesn't hide the fact

1350
01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:05.239
that you killed Thomas Burnett

1351
01:14:06.108 --> 01:14:07.341
and David Drabeck.

1352
01:14:08.442 --> 01:14:09.809
Do you think I'm a monster?

1353
01:14:10.277 --> 01:14:11.978
You murdered three boys.

1354
01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:14.114
And you filmed it.

1355
01:14:19.154 --> 01:14:20.821
Yeah, I watch that film every day.

1356
01:14:26.494 --> 01:14:27.927
I watch that film every day.

1357
01:14:30.098 --> 01:14:32.433
Because if I didn't,

1358
01:14:33.502 --> 01:14:35.436
I would not have the strength to...

1359
01:14:46.547 --> 01:14:48.314
Okay, Dwayne, we'll take
a break if you want.


1360
01:14:49.450 --> 01:14:50.684
Dwayne!

1361
01:14:50.886 --> 01:14:52.085
Dwayne! Jesus!

1362
01:14:52.087 --> 01:14:53.453
Fuck!

1363
01:14:53.955 --> 01:14:56.790
Dwayne! Oh, shit! Adam!

1364
01:14:57.092 --> 01:14:58.225
Dwayne?

1365
01:14:59.059 --> 01:15:00.160
Dwayne?

1366
01:15:00.163 --> 01:15:01.395
Holy shit.

1367
01:15:02.330 --> 01:15:03.531
Oh!

1368
01:15:06.433 --> 01:15:07.834
Holy shit, dude.

1369
01:15:07.836 --> 01:15:09.169
- Call an ambulance.
- Are you okay?


1370
01:15:09.171 --> 01:15:10.236
Call an ambulance.

1371
01:15:10.238 --> 01:15:11.371
I am, I am.

1372
01:15:11.373 --> 01:15:12.972
What the fuck.
His kid's in the back.


1373
01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:15.440
What did you do, man?

1374
01:15:25.319 --> 01:15:26.419
<i>...camera guy?</i>

1375
01:15:26.421 --> 01:15:27.554
<i>It's just you and me.</i>

1376
01:15:31.091 --> 01:15:32.225
<i>That's good.</i>

1377
01:15:33.327 --> 01:15:35.028
<i>This isn't an interview, is it?</i>

1378
01:15:36.896 --> 01:15:38.597
<i>No, it's not.</i>

1379
01:15:38.599 --> 01:15:39.597
<i>Are you saying that..</i>

1380
01:15:39.599 --> 01:15:41.497
<i>I wanted something good
to come from this.</i>


1381
01:15:42.936 --> 01:15:45.103
<i>I thought that I would
find it in the truth.</i>


1382
01:15:45.105 --> 01:15:47.840
<i>Raymond Gibbs
hasn't suffered enough.</i>


1383
01:15:47.842 --> 01:15:50.042
<i>Some people congratulated
me on  getting to Dwayne.</i>


1384
01:15:50.344 --> 01:15:52.144
<i>Cornering him into the truth.</i>

1385
01:15:53.278 --> 01:15:54.478
Jesus! Fuck!

1386
01:15:55.515 --> 01:15:56.814
<i>Dwayne! Holy shit! Adam!</i>

1387
01:15:56.916 --> 01:15:58.484
<i>But there's more to it than that.</i>

1388
01:15:58.586 --> 01:15:59.952
<i>Dwayne?</i>

1389
01:16:00.588 --> 01:16:01.788
<i>Dwayne?</i>

1390
01:16:01.890 --> 01:16:03.156
<i>Holy shit.</i>

1391
01:16:03.924 --> 01:16:04.523
<i>Oh!</i>

1392
01:16:08.094 --> 01:16:10.495
<i>Holy shit, dude!
Are you okay?</i>


1393
01:16:10.497 --> 01:16:11.430
<i>Call an ambulance.</i>

1394
01:16:11.432 --> 01:16:12.130
<i>I am, I am.</i>

1395
01:16:12.132 --> 01:16:14.933
<i>What the fuck.
His kid's in the back.</i>


1396
01:16:16.302 --> 01:16:19.572
<i>Dwayne's son
had died two months earlier.</i>


1397
01:16:20.274 --> 01:16:23.141
<i>About the same time I had
received the anonymous email</i>


1398
01:16:23.142 --> 01:16:24.909
<i>about the Yellowstone Murders.</i>

1399
01:16:26.112 --> 01:16:27.412
<i>Losing his son</i>

1400
01:16:27.414 --> 01:16:28.614
<i>was the final straw.</i>

1401
01:16:28.615 --> 01:16:31.749
<i>Dwayne was clinging
to his son's life</i>


1402
01:16:32.052 --> 01:16:33.619
<i>more than he was
clinging to his own.</i>


1403
01:16:39.024 --> 01:16:40.958
<i>When I returned home,
I had another email</i>


1404
01:16:40.960 --> 01:16:42.293
<i>from chasingbisonbear.</i>

1405
01:16:43.227 --> 01:16:45.462
<i>No subject, no message.</i>

1406
01:16:47.566 --> 01:16:49.533
<i>That image was always
a metaphor for me.</i>


1407
01:16:50.135 --> 01:16:52.336
<i>The chase through Yellowstone.</i>

1408
01:16:52.337 --> 01:16:54.971
<i>But I never fully understood
if I was the bear,</i>


1409
01:16:54.973 --> 01:16:56.606
<i>or if I was the bison.</i>

1410
01:16:56.609 --> 01:16:58.409
<i>The hunter or the hunted.</i>

1411
01:16:59.945 --> 01:17:01.979
<i>Now I realise I was neither.</i>

1412
01:17:01.982 --> 01:17:03.248
<i>I was just the guy
with the camera,</i>


1413
01:17:03.250 --> 01:17:04.316
<i>who captured the story.</i>

1414
01:17:08.587 --> 01:17:11.222
<i>...or whatever.
And Dwayne...</i>


1415
01:17:11.624 --> 01:17:12.422
<i>Dwayne and Bear,</i>

1416
01:17:12.424 --> 01:17:15.426
<i>they went in
pretty much all the time.</i>


1417
01:17:16.261 --> 01:17:17.328
<i>Sorry, "Bear"?</i>

1418
01:17:17.330 --> 01:17:20.031
<i>Bear, yeah. 
Barry was his dad.</i>

1419
01:17:20.331 --> 01:17:21.765
<i>Yeah.</i>

1420
01:17:22.067 --> 01:17:23.667
Dad's just a...

1421
01:17:24.969 --> 01:17:26.269
<i>Barry was his dad.</i>

1422
01:17:26.637 --> 01:17:27.236
<i>Yeah.</i>

1423
01:17:27.838 --> 01:17:30.540
<i>Unlike me, Dwayne actually
looked up to his father.</i>


1424
01:17:31.476 --> 01:17:32.875
<i>I should have paid more attention</i>

1425
01:17:32.877 --> 01:17:34.945
<i>to the email address
from the beginning.</i>


1426
01:17:36.047 --> 01:17:38.616
<i>Two names appear under
the handle "Bison Barry".</i>


1427
01:17:39.318 --> 01:17:43.353
<i>One, a sports director from
a University radio station in Cleveland,</i>


1428
01:17:43.554 --> 01:17:47.289
<i>the other a part time writer for the
West Yellowstone Newspaper</i>


1429
01:17:47.494 --> 01:17:49.061
<i>back in the '70s.</i>

1430
01:17:49.263 --> 01:17:52.164
<i>His full name,
Barry Robert Nelson.</i>


1431
01:17:52.165 --> 01:17:54.198
<i>Father to Dwayne Nelson.</i>

1432
01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:57.535
<i>What caught my eye most
was one article in particular,</i>


1433
01:17:57.737 --> 01:17:59.603
<i>written back in 1978.</i>

1434
01:18:00.374 --> 01:18:03.142
<i>"Idaho 
- Population Zero."</i>

1435
01:18:04.545 --> 01:18:07.146
<i>...as the Yellowstone murderer
was found dead in his home</i>


1436
01:18:07.147 --> 01:18:08.245
<i>early this morning.</i>

1437
01:18:08.247 --> 01:18:11.183
<i>Police have yet to reveal the full
details surrounding his death,</i>


1438
01:18:11.185 --> 01:18:13.285
<i>but early reports
suggests suicide.</i>


1439
01:18:13.286 --> 01:18:14.818
<i>The whole time,
I believed that Dwayne</i>


1440
01:18:14.820 --> 01:18:16.354
<i>wanted to admit the truth.</i>

1441
01:18:16.357 --> 01:18:18.324
<i>But as way to cleanse his soul.</i>

1442
01:18:19.226 --> 01:18:21.527
<i>Now I know that this was
all part of his plan.</i>


1443
01:18:22.028 --> 01:18:24.295
<i>Everything from the get go
had been on his terms.</i>


1444
01:18:24.298 --> 01:18:25.330
<i>Everything.</i>

1445
01:18:25.532 --> 01:18:27.232
<i>The murders, the loophole.</i>

1446
01:18:27.333 --> 01:18:28.299
<i>Even this film.</i>

1447
01:18:29.501 --> 01:18:31.302
<i>He wanted revenge, he got it.</i>

1448
01:18:31.305 --> 01:18:33.739
<i>He wanted the truth out there,
he got that, too.</i>


1449
01:18:34.042 --> 01:18:36.643
<i>He used me,
he used the Justice System,</i>


1450
01:18:36.744 --> 01:18:38.010
<i>he used us all.</i>

1451
01:18:44.516 --> 01:18:47.318
<i>I struggled a lot with whether
I should release this film,</i>


1452
01:18:47.621 --> 01:18:49.788
<i>and whose story
I was trying to tell.</i>


1453
01:18:50.289 --> 01:18:52.356
<i>I wanted something good
to come from this.</i>


1454
01:18:53.425 --> 01:18:55.326
<i>I thought that I would find it
in the truth.</i>


1455
01:18:56.262 --> 01:18:57.562
<i>The truth was worse.</i>

1456
01:18:59.197 --> 01:19:02.199
<i>One man picked a fight with
a multi-million dollar company,</i>


1457
01:19:02.202 --> 01:19:04.903
<i>whose fracking process
was poisoning his home</i>


1458
01:19:05.105 --> 01:19:06.371
<i>and killing his family.</i>

1459
01:19:07.306 --> 01:19:08.574
<i>But nobody won here.</i>

1460
01:19:09.276 --> 01:19:11.210
<i>Not at the expense
of a man's life,</i>


1461
01:19:11.512 --> 01:19:13.946
<i>his family's, and three young men.</i>

1462
01:19:14.747 --> 01:19:17.515
<i>I think there's a lot more to it
than even Dwayne's letting on.</i>


1463
01:19:18.317 --> 01:19:19.852
<i>You know, maybe something that</i>

1464
01:19:20.553 --> 01:19:21.786
<i>can shed a better light.</i>

1465
01:19:25.290 --> 01:19:26.189
<i>That's Dwayne.</i>

1466
01:19:26.191 --> 01:19:29.627
<i>He's just gonna bottle it up
and tell you what you need.</i>


1467
01:19:31.430 --> 01:19:32.496
<i>Bye bye.</i>

1468
01:19:32.498 --> 01:19:33.664
<i>Okay.</i>

1469
01:19:33.666 --> 01:19:35.533
<i>- Muah!
- Muah!</i>


1470
01:19:35.535 --> 01:19:37.101
<i>I love you, dada.</i>

1471
01:19:37.103 --> 01:19:38.769
<i>Love you, dada.</i>

1472
01:19:38.771 --> 01:19:40.137
<i>Oh, so sweet.</i>

1473
01:19:42.239 --> 01:19:44.174
<i>The fact that he
could kill those three boys</i>


1474
01:19:44.276 --> 01:19:45.908
<i>seems unreal to me.</i>

1475
01:19:46.678 --> 01:19:47.512
<i>But...</i>

1476
01:19:48.514 --> 01:19:51.349
<i>You know, you put a man
through what he went through,</i>


1477
01:19:51.450 --> 01:19:54.116
<i>I guess everybody would
have a breaking point, so...</i>


1478
01:20:06.597 --> 01:20:08.598
<i>Yellowstone National Park.</i>

1479
01:20:09.568 --> 01:20:11.869
<i>Around every corner
is a reminder</i>


1480
01:20:11.870 --> 01:20:13.971
<i>of how still life can be.</i>

1481
01:20:14.839 --> 01:20:16.739
<i>How vast it can be.</i>

1482
01:20:19.376 --> 01:20:21.144
<i>How true it can be.</i>

1483
01:20:22.580 --> 01:20:23.680
<i>Until it isn't.</i>
