00:00:13.357 --> 00:00:15.757
Well, guess this is goodbye.

4
00:00:15.823 --> 00:00:17.223
I'm so bad at goodbyes.

5
00:00:17.257 --> 00:00:18.687
I always talk too much.

6
00:00:18.723 --> 00:00:20.893
See, I'm doing it right now!

7
00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.490
Wait a minute, so that's it?

8
00:00:23.523 --> 00:00:26.823
Yeah, we're just going to
never see each other again?


9
00:00:26.857 --> 00:00:28.157
I'm sorry...

10
00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:29.560
Odd Squad is over.

11
00:00:30.723 --> 00:00:31.863
But it's not fair!

12
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.490
Not too long ago,
we were on a mission:


13
00:00:33.523 --> 00:00:34.663
Saving people!

14
00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.220
You think I'm happy?

15
00:00:36.257 --> 00:00:38.417
I went through all that
trouble to get my license.


16
00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:41.820
You can drive a car?

17
00:00:41.823 --> 00:00:44.989
No, the other thing
I was driving...

[dramatic music]

19
00:01:02.257 --> 00:01:04.887
I love the smell
of cheese in the morning.

[Olympia]
C'mon agents! Come on!


21

Put your back into that cheddar!

Orchid!

23
00:01:11.657 --> 00:01:13.557
Give me an update!

Sherman is
closing in... fast!

[distant roar]

26
00:01:22.457 --> 00:01:24.417
It's bigger than I thought.

27
00:01:24.457 --> 00:01:26.217
Way bigger.

29
00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:28.720
All right, people!

30
00:01:28.757 --> 00:01:30.556
We got the cheese in position.

31
00:01:30.557 --> 00:01:33.417
Agent Ohlm, I need a
net to trap that thing.


32
00:01:33.457 --> 00:01:34.917
Here you go, Ms. O.

33
00:01:34.957 --> 00:01:36.987
Hi, I'm Annette.

34
00:01:37.057 --> 00:01:39.217
I'm not sure what
I'm doing here...


35
00:01:39.223 --> 00:01:41.993
No, Ohlm, I need a net

36
00:01:42.057 --> 00:01:43.217
made out of rope.

37
00:01:43.223 --> 00:01:44.293
Oh...

38
00:01:44.323 --> 00:01:46.763
That's going to be
way harder to find.

(shouts)
Owen, can you help?


40
00:01:48.923 --> 00:01:50.763
Can I bring my shield with me?

41
00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.260
Sure.

42
00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.560
Should I hold it
like this? "Aargh!"


43
00:01:54.561 --> 00:01:57.787
Or should I hold it
like this? "Aagh!"

[angry growl]

45
00:01:59.723 --> 00:02:02.663
I'll figure it out as I go.

[sigh]

47
00:02:04.023 --> 00:02:05.993
Ohlm, bring Annette

48
00:02:06.023 --> 00:02:07.793
back to her restaurant.

49
00:02:07.823 --> 00:02:09.193
- Yeah.
- Yeah.


50
00:02:10.723 --> 00:02:12.563
Looks like you
really let us down.

Net in position.


56
00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.060
Wait, do we drop the net

57
00:02:26.123 --> 00:02:28.663
before or after it eats
the shrinking cheese?


58
00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.490
I'll take whatever I can get.

It didn't take the cheese.

00:02:56.023 --> 00:02:59.623
What mouse doesn't
take the cheese?


66
00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.189
Ms. O, I think
it's holding out


67
00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.360
for the fancy stuff.

68
00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.060
The mayor's having
a cheese festival.


69
00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.060
They have Gruyere AND brie!

70
00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.020
That's bad news!
That's really bad news!


71
00:03:11.023 --> 00:03:12.523
They'll get trampled.

72
00:03:12.557 --> 00:03:13.857
We need a gadget to stop it.

73
00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.090
Where's Oona?

74
00:03:15.123 --> 00:03:17.593
She didn't come.
She's sensitive to dairy.


75
00:03:17.623 --> 00:03:19.423
Get her on the phone.
Now.


76
00:03:19.457 --> 00:03:21.287
I'll try and slow it down.

How come you get
a flying suit and we don't?


81
00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.020
Because I'm the boss.

82
00:03:28.023 --> 00:03:30.193
Also, they're crazy expensive.

We're dealing with
a ginormouse and we need -


87
00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.360
Hang on a quick second
while I take care of the Daves.

00:03:52.523 --> 00:03:54.593
- What's happening?
- I don't know.


94
00:03:54.623 --> 00:03:55.693
She's talking about
these Dave things -


95
00:03:55.694 --> 00:03:56.960
You're getting Oona'd.

96
00:03:57.023 --> 00:03:58.063
What?

97
00:03:58.857 --> 00:04:01.617
Oona, we have a bigger
problem than some Dave -


98
00:04:01.657 --> 00:04:03.457
Bigger problem?
Ha!


99
00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:06.860
These Daves double
like nobody's business.


100
00:04:06.923 --> 00:04:08.599
Do you know what happens
when you double a number?


101
00:04:08.623 --> 00:04:10.256
Oona...
Ginormouse.


102
00:04:10.257 --> 00:04:11.587
You add that number to itself.

103
00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:12.790
So one plus one is two.

104
00:04:12.823 --> 00:04:14.323
Two plus two is four,

105
00:04:14.357 --> 00:04:15.617
and four plus four is eight.

106
00:04:15.657 --> 00:04:17.257
And so on, and so on.

107
00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:19.820
So by the end,
you'll have millions of Daves!


108
00:04:19.857 --> 00:04:22.417
Then who's got the problem,

I just got Oona'd.

which can only be made by...

656
00:27:49.490 --> 00:27:50.890

657
00:27:50.923 --> 00:27:52.323
Snail feet?

658
00:27:52.357 --> 00:27:54.387
Debbie still has snail feet?

659
00:27:54.423 --> 00:27:56.693
Wait, wait, they didn't fix me?

660
00:27:56.723 --> 00:27:58.863
No, Weird Tom just
made it look like he did.


661
00:27:58.890 --> 00:28:00.320
[sigh]

662
00:28:00.390 --> 00:28:02.390
[grunts]

663
00:28:04.390 --> 00:28:08.220
Which means he probably didn't
fix anything else either.


664
00:28:08.223 --> 00:28:10.563
Yes!
Ha-ha!


665
00:28:10.590 --> 00:28:12.960
This is awesome!

666
00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:15.090
I mean, it stinks for humanity.

667
00:28:15.123 --> 00:28:16.663
And Debbie's feet.

668
00:28:16.723 --> 00:28:19.963
But for me being right,
it's amazing!


669
00:28:19.990 --> 00:28:21.889
[laughs]

670
00:28:21.890 --> 00:28:23.560
We should tell
Ms. O about this.


671
00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:25.490
Odd Squad?

672
00:28:25.557 --> 00:28:27.657
Right after we get you
to your shop.


673
00:28:27.723 --> 00:28:28.889
Uh-huh.

674
00:28:28.890 --> 00:28:30.389
Must be thirsty
after that pizza.


675
00:28:30.390 --> 00:28:31.890
I do want some...

676
00:28:35.623 --> 00:28:36.722
[Otis] And that's
how Weird Tom's


677
00:28:36.723 --> 00:28:37.963
beating us every time,

678
00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:39.390
because he's not
fixing anything.


679
00:28:39.423 --> 00:28:41.093
[Ms. O] Good work,
you little rascals.


680
00:28:41.123 --> 00:28:42.763
Rascals?

681
00:28:42.790 --> 00:28:45.590
Well, you're not agents anymore

682
00:28:45.623 --> 00:28:47.163
so I'm not sure
what to call you.


683
00:28:47.223 --> 00:28:50.123
Scallywags?
No, not good either.


684
00:28:54.423 --> 00:28:56.463
Uh, Ms. O...

685
00:28:56.490 --> 00:28:57.889
shouldn't you stop digging

686
00:28:57.890 --> 00:28:59.620
and do something about this?

687
00:28:59.657 --> 00:29:00.817
Nope.

688
00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:03.960
A little help here?

689
00:29:12.557 --> 00:29:15.287
I smuggled this odd-ometer
out of headquarters.


690
00:29:15.290 --> 00:29:17.160
It measures all
the oddness in town.


691
00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:18.620
[Otis gasps]

692
00:29:18.623 --> 00:29:19.933
[Ms. O]
Here are five days of the week


693
00:29:19.957 --> 00:29:21.557
along the bottom x-axis

694
00:29:21.623 --> 00:29:24.663
and the number of odd cases
along the y-axis.


695
00:29:24.690 --> 00:29:26.120
When Odd Squad was around,

696
00:29:26.123 --> 00:29:28.123
the number of odd
things always stayed


697
00:29:28.157 --> 00:29:29.456
around the number ten,

698
00:29:29.457 --> 00:29:31.857
as you can see by these
bars that go up to ten.


699
00:29:31.890 --> 00:29:33.120
Because we'd solve stuff,

700
00:29:33.123 --> 00:29:34.623
but then new odd
stuff would pop up.


701
00:29:34.657 --> 00:29:36.287
Exactly.
But look...


702
00:29:38.957 --> 00:29:40.287
The numbers are getting bigger.

703
00:29:40.290 --> 00:29:41.660
Since Weird Team took over,

704
00:29:41.690 --> 00:29:44.520
the level of oddness has
been doubling every day.


705
00:29:44.557 --> 00:29:45.687
[Otis]
Look at the bars.


706
00:29:45.723 --> 00:29:46.963
It started at ten,

707
00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:47.960
the next day it went to 20,

708
00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:49.789
and the day after that
it went to 40 -


709
00:29:49.790 --> 00:29:51.690
[Olympia]
Then 80, then 160.


710
00:29:51.723 --> 00:29:53.863
When you double a number
it gets big fast.


711
00:29:53.890 --> 00:29:55.990
Guys, I've been
studying Weird Team,


712
00:29:56.023 --> 00:29:58.103
and I don't think they've
been solving cases at all -


713
00:29:59.457 --> 00:30:01.787
Oh, you...
you figured it out, too.


714
00:30:02.890 --> 00:30:04.860
Well, what are we waiting for?

715
00:30:04.890 --> 00:30:06.990
Let's get our squad back.

716
00:30:11.023 --> 00:30:13.622
Aw, I got my sweater all
caught up in this thing...


717
00:30:13.623 --> 00:30:15.622
Uh...

718
00:30:15.623 --> 00:30:17.863
I'll... I'll untie it
when I'm running!


719
00:30:18.823 --> 00:30:21.493
I know you said you got
rid of the flying books,


720
00:30:21.523 --> 00:30:24.123
but Dustin keeps getting
hit by something.


721
00:30:24.157 --> 00:30:25.357
Ow!

722
00:30:25.390 --> 00:30:26.560
There.
Did you see that?


723
00:30:26.623 --> 00:30:28.663
We know what you're
up to, Weird Tom!


724
00:30:28.690 --> 00:30:29.690
Shh, shh!

725
00:30:29.723 --> 00:30:32.063
Please, this is a library.

(quietly) Can you please
swat more quietly?


729
00:30:39.157 --> 00:30:42.787
You're not really
solving anything.


730
00:30:42.823 --> 00:30:44.123
You're right.

731

You admitted that


733
00:30:47.657 --> 00:30:49.457
way faster than I thought.

734
00:30:49.490 --> 00:30:51.690
But why do you want
to shut down Odd Squad?


735
00:30:51.723 --> 00:30:54.863
My real name is not Tom...

736
00:30:54.890 --> 00:30:57.360
It's Om.
With an "O".


737
00:30:58.557 --> 00:31:00.957
Don't you remember me, Oprah?

738
00:31:01.023 --> 00:31:04.393
We met back in 1983.

739
00:31:04.423 --> 00:31:06.623
It's you.

740
00:31:06.690 --> 00:31:07.760
(whispers)
Hang on.


741
00:31:07.790 --> 00:31:09.420
Ms. O was around
in 1983?


742
00:31:09.457 --> 00:31:10.757
(quietly)
I know!

Just go with it.

00:31:12.957 --> 00:31:15.017
I was twelve years old.

745

I'd gone through the academy.

746
00:31:17.090 --> 00:31:19.290
The last step was to learn

747
00:31:19.357 --> 00:31:22.517
from the two best
agents in Odd Squad:


748

You and your partner, O'Donahue.

749
00:31:25.690 --> 00:31:28.190
It was 1983.

Well, I will be an agent

And now it's all mine.

818
00:34:13.323 --> 00:34:16.056
Wait, that took you

819
00:34:16.057 --> 00:34:18.457
Well, it took 15 years,

820
00:34:18.490 --> 00:34:19.799
and then I took
a couple years off.


821
00:34:19.823 --> 00:34:21.123
I traveled...

822
00:34:21.157 --> 00:34:22.557
Oh, I did some work
on the house.


823
00:34:22.590 --> 00:34:24.490
The point is -

824
00:34:24.557 --> 00:34:27.257
Ms. O stole
Odd Squad from me,


825
00:34:27.290 --> 00:34:30.220
and now I'm stealing it back.

826
00:34:30.223 --> 00:34:31.323
No, she didn't.

827
00:34:31.390 --> 00:34:33.320
Yeah, she just said
you needed more training.

I've ever told this story to.


830
00:34:38.390 --> 00:34:41.060
Yeah, well, we're
going to tell the world


831
00:34:41.061 --> 00:34:42.217
what you've done.

to do with it.

We have to get in front of
as many people as possible.

[Weird Tom over loudspeaker]
This... is Odd Squad.


842
00:35:12.464 --> 00:35:15.287
Or maybe we should
call them: Odd Squad.


843
00:35:15.290 --> 00:35:16.456
What?

844
00:35:16.457 --> 00:35:17.617
Why?

845
00:35:17.623 --> 00:35:19.163
Because they're causing oddness.

846
00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:20.860
Take a look...

847
00:35:20.890 --> 00:35:23.160
Here they are using
some weird dirt


848
00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:24.990
to give Delivery Debbie...

- Snail feet!
- Help!


850
00:35:30.123 --> 00:35:32.993

Delivery Debbie -


851
00:35:33.023 --> 00:35:35.123
she is a good, honest woman,

852
00:35:35.157 --> 00:35:38.557
with good, honest, human feet.

853
00:35:38.623 --> 00:35:41.723
Please, for your own safety,

854
00:35:41.790 --> 00:35:45.660
stay far, far away
from Odd Squad.


855

Ha, nobody's going
to believe that.


856

It's them!

Thanks!

Could I get some relish on this?

866
00:36:11.861 --> 00:36:13.356
Yeah, yeah!
Relish...


867

Relish, relish...
Okay.

00:36:16.590 --> 00:36:17.560
No! No! No! No!

I need a drink!

Gotta get a drink,
yes, drink, okay!

- I need napkins!
- Napkins!

00:36:29.723 --> 00:36:30.923
I'm a vegetarian.

[screaming]

879
00:36:39.690 --> 00:36:40.790
Here are some tips

880
00:36:40.857 --> 00:36:43.117
on how to identify
an Odd Squad member.


881
00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:44.960
They're children.

882
00:36:45.023 --> 00:36:46.763
Some call them tax deductions.

883
00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:48.356
I call them trouble.

884
00:36:48.357 --> 00:36:50.357
We are in so much trouble.

885
00:36:50.390 --> 00:36:52.290
Did the running and
screaming give it away?


886
00:36:52.357 --> 00:36:54.717
No, look at that door
behind Weird Tom.


887
00:36:54.757 --> 00:36:56.187
That's where I keep the Daves!

888
00:36:56.190 --> 00:36:57.290
Whatever you do,

889
00:36:57.357 --> 00:36:59.617
do not invite
an Odd Squad member


890
00:36:59.657 --> 00:37:00.957
into your home.

891
00:37:00.990 --> 00:37:03.920
What does the number 2048 mean?

892
00:37:03.923 --> 00:37:05.333
That's how many
creatures are inside.


893
00:37:05.357 --> 00:37:08.087
Weird Tom isn't zapping
them with the half-inator.


894
00:37:08.123 --> 00:37:11.023
So you're saying these Daves

895
00:37:11.090 --> 00:37:13.256
are just doubling and doubling?

896
00:37:13.257 --> 00:37:15.457
Yes, take a look at
my calculatorinator.


897
00:37:17.423 --> 00:37:19.323
That's a regular calculator.

898
00:37:19.357 --> 00:37:21.256
Just let me have this one!

899
00:37:21.257 --> 00:37:23.157
Okay.

900
00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:24.420
To double a number,

901
00:37:24.423 --> 00:37:25.633
you add the same
number to itself.


902
00:37:25.657 --> 00:37:29.017
So 2048 plus 2048

903
00:37:29.090 --> 00:37:31.190
is 4096 Daves.

904
00:37:31.257 --> 00:37:35.757
4096 plus 4096...

905
00:37:35.790 --> 00:37:38.920
(scary voice)
is 8192 Daves!


906
00:37:38.957 --> 00:37:41.587
Why'd you say that last part
in a scary voice?


907
00:37:41.623 --> 00:37:42.993
Because scary things
will happen.


908
00:37:43.023 --> 00:37:46.123
The Daves room can
only hold 5,000 Daves.


909
00:37:46.157 --> 00:37:48.417
That means if they
double two more times


910
00:37:48.457 --> 00:37:51.187
to 8,192,

911
00:37:51.257 --> 00:37:53.687
there will be more than 5,000...

912
00:37:53.757 --> 00:37:54.933
Then the room won't hold them...

913
00:37:54.957 --> 00:37:56.399
and they'll break out
and eat the world.


914
00:37:56.423 --> 00:37:57.363
[all]
What?


915
00:37:57.423 --> 00:37:59.423
Oh yeah, fun fact:
They're big eaters.


916
00:37:59.457 --> 00:38:02.157
First it'll be signs
and traffic lights,


917
00:38:02.190 --> 00:38:04.020
kind of like an appetizer.

918
00:38:04.057 --> 00:38:07.687
Then buildings and roads
will be like the main course.


919
00:38:07.723 --> 00:38:11.223
And for dessert,
they'll eat the ground,


920
00:38:11.257 --> 00:38:13.487
and then under the ground...

921
00:38:13.523 --> 00:38:17.063
until the whole earth is gone!

922
00:38:17.090 --> 00:38:20.320
Which is too bad.
I like the earth.


923
00:38:20.323 --> 00:38:21.563
How do we stop it?

924
00:38:21.590 --> 00:38:23.160
We can't get in to headquarters.

925
00:38:23.161 --> 00:38:26.156
Everyone is against us -

926
00:38:26.157 --> 00:38:28.187
Not everyone.

927
00:38:30.223 --> 00:38:31.763

928
00:38:31.823 --> 00:38:33.489

Is that really what you think?

Odd Squad isn't
about what we have.

00:40:46.457 --> 00:40:48.317
better and stronger
than you were before.


981
00:40:48.390 --> 00:40:50.560
[Ms. O]
It's working together.


982
00:40:50.590 --> 00:40:52.620
All seven of us.

983
00:40:54.423 --> 00:40:56.723
Uh, there's only six of us.

984
00:40:56.757 --> 00:40:58.917
[sliding noise]

985
00:40:58.957 --> 00:41:00.157
Hey guys.

986
00:41:00.190 --> 00:41:01.620
[both]
Oscar!


987
00:41:01.657 --> 00:41:03.217
- Good news.
- You brought gadgets?


988
00:41:03.290 --> 00:41:04.290
No, better!

989
00:41:04.291 --> 00:41:05.860
I brought my sewing kit.

990
00:41:05.890 --> 00:41:07.456
[chuckles]

991
00:41:07.457 --> 00:41:09.557
To make suits.

992
00:41:09.623 --> 00:41:11.456
[all]
Oh...


993
00:41:11.457 --> 00:41:12.956
[Otto]
That makes sense.


994
00:41:12.957 --> 00:41:15.456
I know I said Odd Squad
isn't about what we have,


995
00:41:15.457 --> 00:41:17.157
but it doesn't
hurt to look good.


996
00:41:17.190 --> 00:41:18.990
Yeah.

997
00:41:19.023 --> 00:41:23.723
[triumphant music]

998
00:41:23.790 --> 00:41:25.790
[whips cracking]

999
00:41:25.823 --> 00:41:33.823
[triumphant music]

1000
00:41:39.057 --> 00:41:40.287
[music ends]

1001
00:41:42.890 --> 00:41:45.160
How long do we have to
hold this pose for?


1002
00:41:47.623 --> 00:41:48.863
That's enough.

1003
00:41:48.890 --> 00:41:54.290
[excited cross-talk]

1004
00:41:57.123 --> 00:41:58.223
(quietly)
All right,


1005
00:41:58.290 --> 00:41:59.690
let's split up into teams.

1006
00:41:59.723 --> 00:42:01.856
Otis, you and Otto

1007
00:42:01.857 --> 00:42:03.687
will knock out
the security cameras.


1008
00:42:03.690 --> 00:42:07.060
Olive and Olympia, get
the halfinator gadget.


1009
00:42:07.090 --> 00:42:08.790
Wait, doesn't it make more sense

1010
00:42:08.857 --> 00:42:10.357
for the partners
to go together -


1011
00:42:10.390 --> 00:42:12.620
I don't mind hanging out
with Olive,


1012
00:42:12.690 --> 00:42:14.520
I mean if I'm forced to...

1013
00:42:16.723 --> 00:42:19.193
Oscar and Oona, you're coming
with me to Room 100.


1014
00:42:19.223 --> 00:42:20.463
Wait!

1015
00:42:20.523 --> 00:42:21.766
Don't you think it's
a little early for that?


1016
00:42:21.790 --> 00:42:24.356
Trust me, it's going to work.

1017
00:42:24.357 --> 00:42:27.717
Everybody, make this work!

1018
00:42:30.690 --> 00:42:33.720
Olympia, let's go.

1019
00:42:33.757 --> 00:42:35.517
She just said "let's go".

1020
00:42:35.523 --> 00:42:37.723
To me!

1021
00:42:37.757 --> 00:42:39.387
Hey...

1022
00:42:39.423 --> 00:42:40.933
Your partner is a pretty
big fan of Olive, huh?


1023
00:42:40.957 --> 00:42:42.457
The biggest.

1024
00:42:42.523 --> 00:42:44.063
I'll bet you feel the same,

1025
00:42:44.090 --> 00:42:45.790
so I'll give this to you now...

1026
00:42:48.857 --> 00:42:50.017
A photo of you.

1027
00:42:50.023 --> 00:42:52.463
A signed photo of me.

1028
00:42:52.523 --> 00:42:54.023
So you can focus on the mission

1029
00:42:54.057 --> 00:42:55.687
instead of getting my autograph.

1030
00:42:55.690 --> 00:42:57.290
Thank... you?

1031
00:42:57.357 --> 00:42:58.687
Let's not make this weird.

1032
00:42:59.457 --> 00:43:00.757
[sigh]

1033
00:43:01.923 --> 00:43:06.163
[buzzing, whirring]

1034
00:43:06.190 --> 00:43:08.690
There's the button to shut off
the security cameras.


1035
00:43:11.857 --> 00:43:13.317
How do we get through them?

1036
00:43:15.023 --> 00:43:16.823
[both]
Dance through them.


1037
00:43:16.857 --> 00:43:18.187
I knew I liked you.

1038
00:43:19.357 --> 00:43:20.317
Sound-ch... -

1039
00:43:20.357 --> 00:43:21.587
Ragtime piano!

1040
00:43:22.957 --> 00:43:23.987
Okay.

1041
00:43:24.023 --> 00:43:32.023
[jaunty piano music]

1042
00:43:34.090 --> 00:43:42.090
[jaunty piano music]

1043
00:43:44.657 --> 00:43:52.657
[jaunty piano music]

1044
00:43:54.690 --> 00:44:02.690
[jaunty piano music]

1045
00:44:05.490 --> 00:44:06.660
[jaunty piano music]

1046
00:44:06.690 --> 00:44:07.989
They shut off the cameras.

1047
00:44:07.990 --> 00:44:11.090
I can't believe what
they did to this place.


1048
00:44:11.157 --> 00:44:12.217
[Olympia]
I know.


1049
00:44:12.257 --> 00:44:14.157
So office....

1050
00:44:14.190 --> 00:44:15.499
How are we supposed
to get past them,


1051
00:44:15.523 --> 00:44:17.492
and get the gadget from the lab?

1052
00:44:17.493 --> 00:44:20.190
We need to think
the way grown-ups think.


1053
00:44:20.223 --> 00:44:22.663
What do they love more
than anything in the world?


1054
00:44:25.423 --> 00:44:27.063
(whiney voice)
I always thought


1055
00:44:27.090 --> 00:44:29.989
it was better
to go with a dark stain.


1056
00:44:29.990 --> 00:44:32.220
[chuckles]
Shows you what I know!


1057
00:44:32.257 --> 00:44:33.987
Is that biscotti?

1058
00:44:36.357 --> 00:44:38.357
It's more like
a trail of biscotti.


1059
00:44:38.390 --> 00:44:40.090
[gasp]

1060
00:44:40.157 --> 00:44:41.817
Is that fresh coffee?

1061
00:44:43.023 --> 00:44:44.693
Wait a sec...

1062
00:44:44.723 --> 00:44:46.863
Skinny cappuccino for Mitch.

1063
00:44:46.890 --> 00:44:48.489
That's me!
[laughs]


1064
00:44:48.490 --> 00:44:51.190
A latte for Emily!
I'm Emily!


1065
00:44:51.223 --> 00:44:54.593
I got an Oolong tea for Linda?

1066
00:44:54.657 --> 00:44:55.757
Linda?

1067
00:44:55.823 --> 00:44:57.923
Uh, Caramel Macchiato
for Natalie?


1068
00:44:57.990 --> 00:44:59.020
Natalie?

1069
00:44:59.057 --> 00:45:01.056
A flat white for Sarah?

1070
00:45:01.057 --> 00:45:03.117
There is one for everyone!

1071
00:45:03.157 --> 00:45:04.387
Let's go.

1072
00:45:08.390 --> 00:45:10.660
There's a guard
blocking the door.


1073
00:45:10.723 --> 00:45:11.823
How old do you think he is?

1074
00:45:11.890 --> 00:45:14.820
Like, 35 or 45?

1075
00:45:14.890 --> 00:45:15.820
Why does it matter?

1076
00:45:15.890 --> 00:45:17.056
If things don't work out,

1077
00:45:17.057 --> 00:45:18.433
I thought I'd get one
of those jobs at the fair


1078
00:45:18.457 --> 00:45:19.633
where you guess people's ages.

1079
00:45:19.657 --> 00:45:21.556
Greetings, Ms. O.

1080
00:45:21.557 --> 00:45:23.217
[all]
Oksana?


1081
00:45:23.223 --> 00:45:25.563
What are you still
doing in Headquarters?


1082
00:45:25.564 --> 00:45:26.757
What do you mean?

1083
00:45:26.790 --> 00:45:28.433
I've been downstairs for
the past six weeks, cooking.


1084
00:45:28.457 --> 00:45:30.387
Why?

1085
00:45:30.423 --> 00:45:31.993
Because you all
won't stop eating.


1086
00:45:33.390 --> 00:45:35.790
Oksana, while you
were downstairs,


1087
00:45:35.823 --> 00:45:38.063
Odd Squad was taken
over by adults.


1088
00:45:38.090 --> 00:45:39.160
Hmmmm.

1089
00:45:39.223 --> 00:45:40.563
I thought everyone grew up,

1090
00:45:40.564 --> 00:45:42.387
but that makes more sense.

1091
00:45:42.423 --> 00:45:44.222
And now the adults aren't
tending to a creature


1092
00:45:44.223 --> 00:45:46.493
and it'll keep doubling and
we need to get in Room 100 -


1093
00:45:46.557 --> 00:45:48.556
This seems like the
beginning of a long story,


1094
00:45:48.557 --> 00:45:49.987
so I'm going to interrupt.

1095
00:45:50.057 --> 00:45:51.557
What do you want me to do?

1096
00:45:53.123 --> 00:45:54.923
[Oksana]
I'm providing a distraction...


1097
00:45:54.957 --> 00:45:56.617
Hey you, with Spring Rolls!

1098
00:45:56.657 --> 00:45:58.257
Stop!

1099
00:46:00.157 --> 00:46:01.657
Go!
Go, go, go, go!


1100
00:46:05.623 --> 00:46:08.293
Oh, hey, Weird Tom,
thanks for the coffee.


1101
00:46:10.290 --> 00:46:13.560
I didn't buy anybody coffee.

1102
00:46:13.623 --> 00:46:15.193
Did you buy
the trail of biscotti


1103
00:46:15.223 --> 00:46:16.993
that led to the coffee?

1104
00:46:18.790 --> 00:46:20.460
Security cameras...

1105
00:46:21.857 --> 00:46:23.157
The cameras are down!

1106
00:46:24.290 --> 00:46:26.320
We got kids in here.

1107
00:46:26.357 --> 00:46:28.357
You sure?

1108
00:46:28.390 --> 00:46:30.789
I'm providing a distraction!

1109
00:46:30.790 --> 00:46:32.960
Get back here!

1110
00:46:32.990 --> 00:46:37.220
I am so sorry that I ever
doubted you, Weird Tom.


1111
00:46:37.290 --> 00:46:41.060
And I know exactly
what they're up to.


1112
00:46:41.123 --> 00:46:44.063
[tense music]

1113
00:46:44.123 --> 00:46:46.193
We got the half-inator.

1114
00:46:46.223 --> 00:46:47.893
There's the Dave door!

1115
00:46:47.957 --> 00:46:49.287
[slow clapping]

1116
00:46:49.290 --> 00:46:51.390
Well done, Odd Squad.

1117
00:46:51.457 --> 00:46:52.787
You got pretty far,

1118
00:46:52.790 --> 00:46:54.460
but now you're done.

1119
00:46:54.490 --> 00:46:55.789
So done.

1120
00:46:55.790 --> 00:46:57.290
No, you're done!

1121
00:46:57.323 --> 00:46:58.463
Because as we speak,

1122
00:46:58.490 --> 00:46:59.890
Ms. O, Oscar, and Oona

1123
00:46:59.923 --> 00:47:01.893
are carrying out
Stage Three of our plan.


1124
00:47:01.923 --> 00:47:03.863
[upbeat rock music]

1125
00:47:03.890 --> 00:47:05.360
- Whoo hoo!
- We did it!


1126
00:47:05.390 --> 00:47:07.060
Oh...

1127
00:47:07.090 --> 00:47:08.460
[music stops]

1128
00:47:08.523 --> 00:47:10.293
What is this?

1129
00:47:10.357 --> 00:47:14.017
We got party supplies
from Room 100


1130
00:47:14.023 --> 00:47:16.363
to celebrate the success
of our mission.


1131
00:47:17.623 --> 00:47:18.793
(whispers)
You were right.


1132
00:47:18.857 --> 00:47:20.087
Too soon.

1133
00:47:20.123 --> 00:47:22.423
Yeah, way too soon.

1134
00:47:22.457 --> 00:47:24.387
And now I'm going
to stop your plan


1135
00:47:24.423 --> 00:47:26.763
to steal
my awesome t-shirts.


1136
00:47:28.690 --> 00:47:30.060
That's...
that's not our plan.


1137
00:47:31.390 --> 00:47:32.590
- Oh.
- Not even close.


1138
00:47:32.623 --> 00:47:34.356
Oh...

1139
00:47:34.357 --> 00:47:35.933
We need to zap the creatures
inside that door


1140
00:47:35.957 --> 00:47:38.687
or they'll break out
and eat the world.


1141
00:47:38.723 --> 00:47:40.263

like, ten more
double next to it.
