Yeah, nigga,
like it's not desperate over here?


510

I ain't heard from him.

Hey, man, don't even
be worrying about me. Feel me?


535
00:33:30.893 --> 00:33:32.768

It is what it is, you know?

552
00:34:22.435 --> 00:34:23.351
I've been, uh...

553
00:34:27.893 --> 00:34:29.060
I've been thinking a lot.

Yo, just listen to me, all right?

You can't blame all this on me.

We didn't do everything right.

620

And I take responsibility for that.

because of you, Mama.

The reason I'm here...

629
00:39:37.268 --> 00:39:38.560
is inside these walls...

630
