1
00:00:49.497 --> 00:00:50.455
- What the?

2
00:00:56.026 --> 00:00:58.942
I'll fish where I
damn well please.


3
00:01:17.264 --> 00:01:20.964
Okay. Let's see what
we got for Jimbo today.


4
00:01:23.923 --> 00:01:24.837
Okay.

5
00:01:35.935 --> 00:01:37.458
Come on.

6
00:01:37.458 --> 00:01:38.372
Come on.

7
00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:40.679
Come to Jimmy.

8
00:01:42.986 --> 00:01:43.899
Come on.

9
00:01:44.683 --> 00:01:45.597
Come on.

10
00:01:46.946 --> 00:01:48.643
There we go.

11
00:01:48.643 --> 00:01:49.557
Oh, son.

12
00:01:51.472 --> 00:01:53.909
Whoa!

13
00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.346
Whoa.

14
00:01:55.346 --> 00:01:56.303
Whoa! Whoa!

15
00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:58.523
Whoa, son.

16
00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.093
It's a biggin.

17
00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:11.753
Son of a bitch broke
my fucking line!


18
00:02:12.711 --> 00:02:14.408
That was a big fish.

19
00:02:16.541 --> 00:02:17.455
God.

20
00:02:35.777 --> 00:02:38.606
Well, now, where
did you come from?


21
00:02:40.304 --> 00:02:43.176
Shoot, you're just a
little thing. Just a baby.


22
00:02:43.176 --> 00:02:45.918
Why don't you come back when
you're big enough to eat?


23
00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:28.977
Chad, I need
my caramel latte.


24
00:04:28.977 --> 00:04:30.805
Is there anywhere to stop?

25
00:04:30.805 --> 00:04:32.677
There's, like, a Starbies
along the way, right?


26
00:04:32.677 --> 00:04:34.679
- Tonight's gonna be lit!
The fridge is packed.


27
00:04:34.679 --> 00:04:36.115
- Say hi to the camera, babe.

28
00:04:36.115 --> 00:04:37.682
- What's good?

29
00:04:37.682 --> 00:04:39.379
You know what time it
is. Roach it, baby.


30
00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:41.468
- Wait, babe. This
lighting hits so hard.


31
00:04:41.468 --> 00:04:43.427
Get in here.
- Oh my God, really?


32
00:04:43.427 --> 00:04:44.297
- Yes! Oh!

33
00:04:45.429 --> 00:04:46.734
Why aren't we there yet?

34
00:04:46.734 --> 00:04:48.649
- Bro.
- Well, we would be,


35
00:04:48.649 --> 00:04:51.391
but we're waiting for Sam
to finish taking a piss!


36
00:04:51.391 --> 00:04:53.263
- Bitches, bro.
- Let's go, bro!


37
00:04:53.263 --> 00:04:55.656
- Guys, hey, it's Pearce!
Say hi to the camera.


38
00:04:55.656 --> 00:04:58.137
- What up, bro? Get
this for the Gram.


39
00:04:58.137 --> 00:04:59.269
- Oh, yes!

40
00:04:59.269 --> 00:05:00.922
- Oh! Woo!

41
00:05:00.922 --> 00:05:02.489
Hope, what about you?

42
00:05:03.403 --> 00:05:04.448
- Ugh, lame.

43
00:05:05.492 --> 00:05:07.320
Let's go, bro!

44
00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:08.408
- Sorry. Ah!

45
00:05:08.408 --> 00:05:09.931
Sorry. Sorry.

46
00:05:09.931 --> 00:05:12.325
- Oh my God, babe.
- Party with the boys!


47
00:05:12.325 --> 00:05:14.806
- Sorry. Oh, hey, is
this for Instagram?


48
00:05:14.806 --> 00:05:16.416
Hey, it's-

49
00:05:16.416 --> 00:05:17.417
- Just get in the car,
bro. We gotta go, okay?


50
00:05:17.417 --> 00:05:18.418
Let's go.

51
00:05:18.418 --> 00:05:19.550
In the trunk. Come on.

52
00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.901
- Spring break! Woo!

53
00:05:24.511 --> 00:05:27.601
- Lock him in there.
- Get the fuck in there, Sam.


54
00:05:27.601 --> 00:05:29.429
Girls, as
soon as we get there,


55
00:05:29.429 --> 00:05:31.388
I say we go straight
skinny dipping.


56
00:05:31.388 --> 00:05:33.912
- Woo!
- Just buckle up and shut up.


57
00:05:33.912 --> 00:05:35.957
♪ Better watch out, player

58
00:05:35.957 --> 00:05:38.221
♪ Come on
- Slay!


59
00:05:38.221 --> 00:05:39.570
I'm about
to slay that ass.


60
00:05:41.093 --> 00:05:42.225
Is there
any AC on back here?


61
00:05:42.225 --> 00:05:43.051
Who is that back there?

62
00:05:43.051 --> 00:05:44.618
Oh, shit. Sam.

63
00:05:44.618 --> 00:05:46.185
I can't believe your
mom let you out, Sam.


64
00:05:46.185 --> 00:05:47.795
I think
I'm gonna crush


65
00:05:47.795 --> 00:05:49.797
like 15 beers right
when we get there.


66
00:05:49.797 --> 00:05:52.496
Bro, you think
we got enough beer, dude?


67
00:05:52.496 --> 00:05:54.715
I basically
bought out the store, bro.


68
00:05:54.715 --> 00:05:56.326
Fuck yeah, bro.

69
00:05:56.326 --> 00:05:58.371
Someone's lube
is leaking on my leg.


70
00:05:59.938 --> 00:06:01.766
- Yeah!
- Yeah, best weekend ever.


71
00:06:01.766 --> 00:06:02.941
I can't wait!

72
00:06:02.941 --> 00:06:04.377
- Pais isn't shy. Are you, Pais?

73
00:06:04.377 --> 00:06:05.204
- Not at all.

74
00:06:05.204 --> 00:06:06.379
- Ah!

75
00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:07.859
My leg is really wet.

76
00:06:07.859 --> 00:06:09.295
- Oh my gosh.

77
00:06:09.295 --> 00:06:10.601
- God, it's so
fucking warm in here.


78
00:06:10.601 --> 00:06:11.602
- Babe!
- Sorry.


79
00:06:11.602 --> 00:06:13.647
- You're on camera! God!

80
00:06:13.647 --> 00:06:15.954
You keep ruining it.
- I'm just saying.


81
00:06:15.954 --> 00:06:17.521
It's like all of the time.

82
00:06:17.521 --> 00:06:19.305
Oh, shit. Are you guys
ready for this shit?


83
00:06:19.305 --> 00:06:20.828
Oh my God.

84
00:06:20.828 --> 00:06:21.829
It's gonna
blow your fucking mind.


85
00:06:21.829 --> 00:06:23.440
All right. Let's roll.

86
00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:24.963
Is anyone
else thinking about


87
00:06:24.963 --> 00:06:26.007
hopping in the lake,
or is it just me?


88
00:06:26.007 --> 00:06:27.357
Ooh, Chad!

89
00:06:27.357 --> 00:06:28.923
- Ow!
- Let's go, bitches!


90
00:06:28.923 --> 00:06:30.490
Oh my God.

91
00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:33.711
Babe!

92
00:06:33.711 --> 00:06:34.799
- Boom! Yes!

93
00:06:35.626 --> 00:06:36.801
Hey, uh-

94
00:06:36.801 --> 00:06:37.932
- Oh my God, babe!

95
00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:40.892
- Welcome to paradise, fam!

96
00:06:40.892 --> 00:06:42.546
Bro.

97
00:06:42.546 --> 00:06:44.025
- Is this place not
fucking lit or what?


98
00:06:44.025 --> 00:06:45.940
Hell yeah, bro!

99
00:06:49.292 --> 00:06:50.293
I'm so excited!

100
00:06:50.293 --> 00:06:51.816
- Go low, bro. Uh.

101
00:06:51.816 --> 00:06:53.905
It's all ours, baby.
All ours, baby.


102
00:06:53.905 --> 00:06:54.949
- Dope, bro!

103
00:06:54.949 --> 00:06:56.908
- Hey, guys, guys, guys,

104
00:06:56.908 --> 00:06:58.475
before we go in there, we
should just remember that,


105
00:06:58.475 --> 00:07:00.651
you know, we're out in
the wilderness, right?


106
00:07:00.651 --> 00:07:04.394
There could be, like, animals
or who knows what out here,


107
00:07:04.394 --> 00:07:06.570
so we should just
try and be careful.


108
00:07:08.093 --> 00:07:09.312
- Yeah.

109
00:07:11.836 --> 00:07:13.403
- Okay, Dad.

110
00:07:13.403 --> 00:07:15.274
Does everyone have
their sunscreen?


111
00:07:15.274 --> 00:07:18.495
'Cause I don't want anyone
getting a sunburn, you know?


112
00:07:18.495 --> 00:07:21.280
- What about the mosquitoes
this time of year, guys?


113
00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:23.064
Don't forget to use a condom!

114
00:07:23.064 --> 00:07:24.675
Fuck yeah, dude.

115
00:07:24.675 --> 00:07:26.241
- Wait, wait. Say it
again for the camera.


116
00:07:26.241 --> 00:07:28.896
- I'm just saying UV
rays and mosquitoes


117
00:07:28.896 --> 00:07:30.463
can be very dangerous
this time of year.


118
00:07:30.463 --> 00:07:32.030
- You know what else
can be dangerous?


119
00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:33.945
Me spraying it in
your face, bitch.


120
00:07:33.945 --> 00:07:35.686
- Bye.
- So unsanitary.


121
00:07:35.686 --> 00:07:36.774
- Loser!

122
00:07:38.515 --> 00:07:40.038
- Don't forget the bags, bro.

123
00:07:41.996 --> 00:07:45.435
Bro, this is what I'm hitting
every day of the week, bro.


124
00:07:45.435 --> 00:07:46.479
What's up?

125
00:07:47.872 --> 00:07:49.482
Hey, those work-outs
are paying off.


126
00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:52.355
- Call master! Call master!

127
00:07:52.355 --> 00:07:53.834
Shotgun on master, baby.

128
00:07:55.401 --> 00:07:57.360
Guys.

129
00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:58.883
All right, let's
get the fuck in. Come on.


130
00:07:58.883 --> 00:08:00.754
What's the
second amendment?


131
00:08:04.454 --> 00:08:05.933
- Oh.
- It's giving


132
00:08:05.933 --> 00:08:10.068
cottage core toxic
masculinity retro vibes.


133
00:08:11.286 --> 00:08:13.463
- Masculine as fuck, babe.

134
00:08:14.464 --> 00:08:15.378
- Bro,

135
00:08:16.944 --> 00:08:19.164
is your uncle a
samurai or some shit?


136
00:08:19.164 --> 00:08:20.078
- Hah, no, bro.

137
00:08:21.514 --> 00:08:23.211
He runs a few painkiller
pill mills in Florida.


138
00:08:23.211 --> 00:08:25.039
I'm gonna work for him soon.

139
00:08:25.039 --> 00:08:26.954
Dude makes some mad bank, bro.

140
00:08:28.739 --> 00:08:30.654
- What's the Wi-Fi here?
I have, like, zero signal.


141
00:08:30.654 --> 00:08:32.612
- Uh, I don't know
if he has it, bro.


142
00:08:32.612 --> 00:08:34.353
You know, this is his
off-the-ground kinda stuff.


143
00:08:36.268 --> 00:08:37.095
- What?

144
00:08:37.095 --> 00:08:38.009
- Oh my...

145
00:08:39.445 --> 00:08:40.794
- Great, I'm gonna
redneck swamp house,


146
00:08:40.794 --> 00:08:42.274
and I can't even post about it.

147
00:08:42.274 --> 00:08:43.797
Oh.

148
00:08:43.797 --> 00:08:45.669
- Hope, just 'cause
you're my sister


149
00:08:45.669 --> 00:08:47.845
doesn't mean you get to kill
the fucking vibes, okay?


150
00:08:47.845 --> 00:08:49.194
- Step-sister.

151
00:08:49.194 --> 00:08:51.065
- Whatever.

152
00:08:51.065 --> 00:08:52.980
We can all survive for three
days without it, right?


153
00:08:54.895 --> 00:08:56.331
All right, let's all, you
know, go set our shit down.


154
00:08:56.331 --> 00:08:58.856
Maybe chill for a
little bit in our rooms,


155
00:08:58.856 --> 00:09:00.031
- Okay.

156
00:09:00.031 --> 00:09:00.858
- Then do some shots, baby!

157
00:09:00.858 --> 00:09:02.425
- Yes!

158
00:09:02.425 --> 00:09:03.817
It's time to rage!

159
00:09:03.817 --> 00:09:04.862
- Fuck yeah.

160
00:09:06.124 --> 00:09:08.996
Babe, hurry up. I'm horny.

161
00:09:08.996 --> 00:09:12.652
Come on, babe. We're
about to break this bed.


162
00:09:12.652 --> 00:09:15.133
Woo! Spring break!

163
00:09:26.274 --> 00:09:27.275
- Oh!
- Yes!


164
00:09:28.625 --> 00:09:29.669
- Yeah, that's
right. What you got?


165
00:09:29.669 --> 00:09:31.149
Oh, oh, physical!

166
00:09:36.589 --> 00:09:37.982
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

167
00:09:39.549 --> 00:09:40.985
Look at that
fucking ass you got.


168
00:09:40.985 --> 00:09:42.552
- Does it look good?

169
00:09:42.552 --> 00:09:44.597
- Yeah. That stick
that out, baby.


170
00:09:44.597 --> 00:09:46.120
Oh, yeah. Right there.

171
00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:47.339
Fuck yeah.

172
00:09:57.088 --> 00:09:58.437
- Yeah, squeeze that shit.

173
00:09:58.437 --> 00:10:01.135
Aw, yeah, baby. Oh, yeah.

174
00:10:01.135 --> 00:10:04.269
Sarah's not gonna know
what fucking hit her. Oh.


175
00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:06.793
Gotta get the obliques.

176
00:10:06.793 --> 00:10:09.056
Side crunch. Side crunch.

177
00:10:10.971 --> 00:10:11.885
- Woo!

178
00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:23.201
Looks
fucking awesome, baby.


179
00:10:23.201 --> 00:10:24.681
Oh!

180
00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:30.121
- Oh, that was good. Woo.

181
00:10:55.015 --> 00:10:57.104
- Damn, babe. Look at that ass.

182
00:11:00.499 --> 00:11:01.718
- Ooh.

183
00:11:01.718 --> 00:11:02.675
Oh, yeah.

184
00:11:02.675 --> 00:11:03.633
Woop, woop!

185
00:11:04.459 --> 00:11:06.636
Let's party!

186
00:11:06.636 --> 00:11:08.333
Woo, ooh!

187
00:11:08.333 --> 00:11:10.683
- O
-M
-G. Fit check.

188
00:11:10.683 --> 00:11:12.685
You guys are so fucking cute.

189
00:11:12.685 --> 00:11:14.208
- Tell me this is
not a total slay.


190
00:11:14.208 --> 00:11:16.167
I got the pants from Shein.

191
00:11:16.167 --> 00:11:17.560
- Oh my God, babe, take a
photo of the three of us.


192
00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:18.473
- Of course.

193
00:11:19.387 --> 00:11:20.954
- Get on that, boy.

194
00:11:23.043 --> 00:11:25.437
- All right. Everyone
say "tequila"!


195
00:11:26.656 --> 00:11:27.918
- Baby.
- Tequila!


196
00:11:27.918 --> 00:11:29.528
Yeah?

197
00:11:29.528 --> 00:11:30.485
- How many times do
I have to tell you?


198
00:11:30.485 --> 00:11:32.357
What?

199
00:11:32.357 --> 00:11:33.924
- That is the worst angle
ever. Hold it up high.


200
00:11:33.924 --> 00:11:35.621
You're gonna make us look bleh.

201
00:11:35.621 --> 00:11:37.536
Sorry, babe. God damn.

202
00:11:37.536 --> 00:11:39.103
"Tequila." One, two, three.

203
00:11:39.103 --> 00:11:40.191
Tequila!

204
00:11:40.191 --> 00:11:41.192
Yeah!

205
00:11:42.367 --> 00:11:43.542
- Let me see.

206
00:11:46.937 --> 00:11:49.287
Horrid. I look fat.

207
00:11:49.287 --> 00:11:50.941
- Babe.

208
00:11:50.941 --> 00:11:53.117
- Big yikes. We can
Facetune it though.


209
00:11:53.117 --> 00:11:55.336
- Party Sam flying in!

210
00:11:57.208 --> 00:11:58.078
- Bro.

211
00:11:59.079 --> 00:12:00.733
Are you going to church?

212
00:12:00.733 --> 00:12:01.908
- What?
- Bro.


213
00:12:01.908 --> 00:12:03.388
What? No, this is a nice shirt.

214
00:12:03.388 --> 00:12:06.739
It's totally in
season. It's Bonobos.


215
00:12:06.739 --> 00:12:09.655
- You're giving single
dad freeloader vibes.


216
00:12:09.655 --> 00:12:11.178
- Yeah.
- Bro.


217
00:12:11.178 --> 00:12:13.659
- It's a nice shirt,
Sam. I like it.


218
00:12:13.659 --> 00:12:14.486
- You do?

219
00:12:14.486 --> 00:12:15.313
- Yeah.

220
00:12:16.531 --> 00:12:17.445
- Hope likes it.

221
00:12:20.492 --> 00:12:22.450
- Okay, Hope. Don't
wait for us or anything.


222
00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:24.801
- Actually, we probably
should eat something, right?


223
00:12:24.801 --> 00:12:27.107
I mean, if we're gonna
be drinking all day.


224
00:12:27.107 --> 00:12:28.979
Good point.

225
00:12:28.979 --> 00:12:30.633
- Okay, so for now, I was
thinking we would do snackies.


226
00:12:32.112 --> 00:12:33.723
I'm making this vegan
dip recipe from Goop,


227
00:12:33.723 --> 00:12:36.247
and then later, I got us
gluten-free pizza rolls.


228
00:12:36.247 --> 00:12:37.422
They're, like, bomb.

229
00:12:37.422 --> 00:12:38.597
- Yeah.

230
00:12:38.597 --> 00:12:40.947
- Perfect. That sounds so good.

231
00:12:40.947 --> 00:12:42.514
- Oh, yeah, guys, I also have

232
00:12:42.514 --> 00:12:44.037
some whey protein
bars in the closet.


233
00:12:44.037 --> 00:12:45.604
- Fuck that. Let's
do another shot.


234
00:12:45.604 --> 00:12:46.779
- Yes!

235
00:12:48.651 --> 00:12:50.740
- Wait, save it. The real
toast will be outside.


236
00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:52.611
- Yeah?

237
00:12:52.611 --> 00:12:55.179
- Oh my God, wait, are
you guys getting engaged?


238
00:12:55.179 --> 00:12:56.267
- What? No.

239
00:12:59.444 --> 00:13:03.970
I mean, not yet.

240
00:13:05.711 --> 00:13:08.279
Okay, so did you guys bring
your school laptops like I said?


241
00:13:08.279 --> 00:13:10.281
- I don't know why.
There's not even service.


242
00:13:10.281 --> 00:13:12.022
I can't even do my B reel, girl.

243
00:13:13.763 --> 00:13:16.591
- Just get it and meet
us outside for the toast.


244
00:13:16.591 --> 00:13:18.115
- Whatever.

245
00:13:18.115 --> 00:13:19.682
- Maybe it's not a good...

246
00:13:19.682 --> 00:13:20.683
- All right.

247
00:13:20.683 --> 00:13:21.727
- All right.

248
00:13:28.647 --> 00:13:30.693
God, hurry up, Hope.

249
00:13:30.693 --> 00:13:32.738
- "God, hurry up, Hope."

250
00:13:34.435 --> 00:13:35.349
- Hope.

251
00:13:39.397 --> 00:13:42.269
Don't worry. I'll
get the laptops&gt;


252
00:13:51.801 --> 00:13:53.367
Okay, so I was
thinking I would shoot


253
00:13:53.367 --> 00:13:54.934
all these different
videos, like,


254
00:13:54.934 --> 00:13:56.457
kind of around the
lake, you know,


255
00:13:56.457 --> 00:13:58.024
just to kind of
show the wildlife


256
00:13:58.024 --> 00:13:59.156
and how I'm super
into wilderness


257
00:13:59.156 --> 00:14:00.723
and hiking and all of that.

258
00:14:00.723 --> 00:14:02.202
I think it'd be
super interesting,


259
00:14:02.202 --> 00:14:03.813
and just for my
following, you know?


260
00:14:03.813 --> 00:14:05.292
Like, I feel like
it's gonna gain me


261
00:14:05.292 --> 00:14:06.816
probably like 50,000
extra followers.


262
00:14:06.816 --> 00:14:08.121
What do you guys think?

263
00:14:08.121 --> 00:14:09.122
Baby?

264
00:14:09.122 --> 00:14:10.297
Yes.

265
00:14:10.297 --> 00:14:11.298
Pour the shots.

266
00:14:11.298 --> 00:14:11.690
Yes, ma'am.

267
00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:15.476
- Are you gonna tell us
why we have our laptops?


268
00:14:15.476 --> 00:14:18.871
It's spring break. I
don't wanna look at this.


269
00:14:18.871 --> 00:14:20.960
- Yeah, I'd actually
like to know that too.


270
00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:23.267
- Okay, I'm gonna film
my toast for TikTok,


271
00:14:23.267 --> 00:14:25.791
and, at the end, you
all just follow my lead.


272
00:14:25.791 --> 00:14:28.533
We're gonna throw our laptops
into the water at the end.


273
00:14:28.533 --> 00:14:29.360
- Wait, what?

274
00:14:30.535 --> 00:14:32.102
- Yeah.

275
00:14:32.102 --> 00:14:33.668
- Wait, wait, wait,
guys, guys, guys.


276
00:14:33.668 --> 00:14:35.627
We can't actually
be doing this, okay?


277
00:14:35.627 --> 00:14:37.542
Bro.

278
00:14:37.542 --> 00:14:39.022
- This is a hundred percent
gonna go viral, you guys.


279
00:14:39.022 --> 00:14:40.023
Just trust.

280
00:14:40.023 --> 00:14:41.546
- Yes! I love it!

281
00:14:41.546 --> 00:14:42.939
- Okay, are you ready?

282
00:14:42.939 --> 00:14:44.767
- Wait, wait, guys, guys.

283
00:14:44.767 --> 00:14:46.507
We can not throw our laptops
into the water, okay?


284
00:14:46.507 --> 00:14:48.074
These belong to the school,

285
00:14:48.074 --> 00:14:48.858
and it's a complete
environmental hazard.


286
00:14:48.858 --> 00:14:50.381
Bro!

287
00:14:50.381 --> 00:14:51.948
- Think of your
children's children!


288
00:14:51.948 --> 00:14:54.254
- Bro, stop being such
a bitch. Just do it.


289
00:14:54.254 --> 00:14:55.995
Don't you wanna go viral?

290
00:14:55.995 --> 00:14:59.303
- Dog, you know Sarah's
really trying to


291
00:14:59.303 --> 00:15:01.609
become an influencer, okay?

292
00:15:01.609 --> 00:15:03.655
Don't ruin her dreams, my guy.

293
00:15:03.655 --> 00:15:06.832
- Yeah, and the school's just
gonna give us new ones anyway,


294
00:15:06.832 --> 00:15:09.095
and fuck that
capitalist institution.


295
00:15:09.095 --> 00:15:10.836
- I'll need a refill here, Chad.

296
00:15:10.836 --> 00:15:12.403
- Whatever, Hope.

297
00:15:12.403 --> 00:15:13.447
- Chad!

298
00:15:21.281 --> 00:15:22.761
Thanks, bro.

299
00:15:22.761 --> 00:15:23.675
- Bro.

300
00:15:27.505 --> 00:15:30.813
- I dedicate this toast
to only being young once,


301
00:15:30.813 --> 00:15:32.640
to those of us
out there who know


302
00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:35.818
the world is gonna make us
get jobs, get old and boring,


303
00:15:35.818 --> 00:15:37.384
and we say no!

304
00:15:37.384 --> 00:15:40.126
We say fuck that! We're
young, wild, and free!


305
00:15:40.126 --> 00:15:41.345
Cheers to Gen Z.

306
00:15:41.345 --> 00:15:43.260
We party. We love.

307
00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:46.654
We nurture. We care
about one another.


308
00:15:46.654 --> 00:15:51.485
Cheers to us, to life, and
to saying fuck the normalcy


309
00:15:51.485 --> 00:15:54.749
and screw their
expectations of us!


310
00:15:54.749 --> 00:15:55.707
Cheers, bitches!

311
00:15:55.707 --> 00:15:56.926
Woo!

312
00:16:02.757 --> 00:16:03.933
Let's go!

313
00:16:03.933 --> 00:16:05.151
Woo!

314
00:16:06.413 --> 00:16:07.632
- YOLO!
- Slay!


315
00:16:08.459 --> 00:16:09.852
Get it!

316
00:16:11.592 --> 00:16:13.638
You killed it, babe.

317
00:16:13.638 --> 00:16:14.552
Yes.

318
00:16:24.344 --> 00:16:28.000
- Girl, I had literal
tears in my eyes.


319
00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.132
That was so slay.

320
00:16:29.132 --> 00:16:30.742
- Like major slay?

321
00:16:30.742 --> 00:16:31.569
- Major slay.

322
00:16:31.569 --> 00:16:33.440
- Ooh!

323
00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:35.878
Well, it would have been perfect
if Hope didn't fuck it up.


324

we're getting out of here


644
00:33:11.089 --> 00:33:12.090
is with the Jeep.

645
00:33:12.090 --> 00:33:14.005
I'm gonna go get it.

646
00:33:14.005 --> 00:33:16.094
I might even have to take this
thing out for my boy Pearce!


647
00:33:16.094 --> 00:33:17.182
- No, baby. It's too dangerous.

648
00:33:17.182 --> 00:33:19.097
You can't!

649
00:33:19.097 --> 00:33:20.925
- She's right, dude. It's
way too dangerous out there.


650
00:33:20.925 --> 00:33:22.884
I'm an alpha, bro!

651
00:33:25.495 --> 00:33:26.844
Yes!

652
00:33:26.844 --> 00:33:28.802
Okay, I'm gonna get the car

653
00:33:28.802 --> 00:33:31.283
and reverse as close
as I can to the door.


654
00:33:31.283 --> 00:33:33.198
You all pile in and we GTFO!

655
00:33:34.547 --> 00:33:36.680
On God, it's the only way.

656
00:33:38.116 --> 00:33:39.857
- You're so brave.

657
00:33:39.857 --> 00:33:41.119
- Or massively stupid.

658
00:33:41.119 --> 00:33:42.860
Seriously, Chad!
It's a bad idea!


659
00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:44.731
- I'm gonna get us out of here.

660
00:33:44.731 --> 00:33:47.038
I'll go see what else my
uncle has in his bedroom.


661
00:33:47.038 --> 00:33:48.300
He might even have a strap.

662
00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:49.693
- A strap-on?

663
00:33:50.737 --> 00:33:52.087
What are you gonna do, fuck it?

664
00:33:52.087 --> 00:33:54.916
- What? No, bro, a strap.

665
00:33:54.916 --> 00:33:57.135
A fucking gun.

666
00:33:57.135 --> 00:33:58.310
- Oh.

667
00:33:58.310 --> 00:33:59.877
- God.

668
00:33:59.877 --> 00:34:01.966
- Yeah, God, Hope. Can
you be serious for once?


669
00:34:01.966 --> 00:34:03.576
You're such an idiot!

670
00:34:04.751 --> 00:34:07.102
Baby, wait! Wait!

671
00:34:07.102 --> 00:34:08.755
Don't leave me with them!

672
00:34:09.713 --> 00:34:11.976
Fuck yeah!

673
00:34:11.976 --> 00:34:12.934
- You okay?

674
00:34:14.370 --> 00:34:15.501
- Not really.

675
00:34:16.807 --> 00:34:17.634
You?

676
00:34:17.634 --> 00:34:18.722
- No.

677
00:34:18.722 --> 00:34:19.897
- Yeah.

678
00:34:19.897 --> 00:34:21.507
- And this plan is dumb as shit.

679
00:34:21.507 --> 00:34:22.944
- You can say that again.

680
00:34:22.944 --> 00:34:24.641
- But I don't see any other way.

681
00:34:26.295 --> 00:34:29.820
- I mean, that gator,
it seemed different.


682
00:34:31.430 --> 00:34:34.346
Like, could that be even real?

683
00:34:34.346 --> 00:34:36.348
It looked different, right?

684
00:34:36.348 --> 00:34:39.873
Like it was from another
planet or something.


685
00:34:39.873 --> 00:34:43.094
Like, none of this
makes any sense.


686
00:34:43.094 --> 00:34:43.965
- I know.

687
00:34:45.705 --> 00:34:50.406
- By the way, when Chad was
talking about his strap,


688
00:34:51.798 --> 00:34:54.540
I had no idea what
he was talking about.


689
00:34:54.540 --> 00:34:55.454
- I did.

690
00:34:57.282 --> 00:34:58.892
- Of course you did.

691
00:35:00.459 --> 00:35:02.722
At least, if we do die tonight,

692
00:35:04.072 --> 00:35:06.465
we'll die having beaten
them in beer pong.


693
00:35:06.465 --> 00:35:07.466
- Good point.

694
00:35:07.466 --> 00:35:09.164
- Yeah.

695
00:35:09.164 --> 00:35:10.817
- Hey, it'll be all right.

696
00:35:11.862 --> 00:35:13.603
Chad has an idiot confidence.

697
00:35:15.083 --> 00:35:17.476
Things always go right
for people like that.


698
00:35:17.476 --> 00:35:19.087
- Yeah.

699
00:35:19.087 --> 00:35:20.001
- Let's go!

700
00:35:21.437 --> 00:35:23.830
Oh, shit, Hope. I always
thought you were gay.


701
00:35:24.875 --> 00:35:26.659
- Fuck off.

702
00:35:26.659 --> 00:35:28.009
- Not that there's
anything wrong with that.


703
00:35:28.009 --> 00:35:30.315
I'm actually an ally.

704
00:35:30.315 --> 00:35:32.056
- It's not even the same thing.

705
00:35:32.056 --> 00:35:33.666
- What?

706
00:35:33.666 --> 00:35:35.625
- Chad, are you sure
this is a good idea?


707
00:35:35.625 --> 00:35:37.714
I mean, maybe we can come
up with something better.


708
00:35:37.714 --> 00:35:40.238
- I was born for it.

709
00:35:40.238 --> 00:35:43.154
- I'm like fucking
SEAL Team Six, bro.


710
00:35:47.332 --> 00:35:48.725
- So hot.

711
00:35:48.725 --> 00:35:50.596
- Thanks, babe.

712
00:35:50.596 --> 00:35:52.772
- Okay. Is there
anything we can do?


713
00:35:52.772 --> 00:35:53.686
- Nah.

714
00:35:55.166 --> 00:35:56.254
It's all me.

715
00:36:01.868 --> 00:36:03.174
The second I go out there-

716
00:36:03.174 --> 00:36:04.349
- Fuck.

717
00:36:04.349 --> 00:36:05.916
- You guys lock this door, okay?

718
00:36:05.916 --> 00:36:09.789
I'm gonna stay low and
make my way to the car.


719
00:36:09.789 --> 00:36:12.053
No matter what happens
to me out there,


720
00:36:12.053 --> 00:36:15.360
do not open the door until
I back the car up, okay?


721
00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:16.187
Okay, babe?

722
00:36:16.187 --> 00:36:17.710
Okay? Okay?

723
00:36:17.710 --> 00:36:19.234
- Okay.
- Yeah, yeah.


724
00:36:19.234 --> 00:36:20.365
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.


725
00:36:21.671 --> 00:36:23.629
- Babe, I have no fear.

726
00:36:25.849 --> 00:36:26.763
Zero.

727
00:36:28.156 --> 00:36:30.201
I need you to stay
strong for me.


728
00:36:30.201 --> 00:36:31.811
- Okay.

729
00:36:31.811 --> 00:36:34.336
- I got this, babe.
You know it, right?


730
00:36:34.336 --> 00:36:36.207
- Okay.

731
00:36:36.207 --> 00:36:39.732
- I'm just built
different, babe.


732
00:36:43.519 --> 00:36:44.389
Mwah!

733
00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:46.130
Woo.

734
00:36:47.827 --> 00:36:49.351
Oh, yeah. No fear.

735
00:36:51.396 --> 00:36:52.745
No fucking fear.

736
00:36:54.225 --> 00:36:56.619
Fear is weakness.
Pain is weakness.


737
00:36:59.970 --> 00:37:00.971
- Good luck, man.

738
00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:05.323
- You may be an idiot,
but you are brave.


739
00:37:05.323 --> 00:37:10.285
- Guys, it's nothing. This
thing ain't got shit on me.


740
00:37:10.285 --> 00:37:11.416
Let's go! Oh!

741
00:37:12.678 --> 00:37:14.811
- Go get 'em, babe!
- Woo!


742
00:37:17.553 --> 00:37:18.902
- Okay.

743
00:37:22.079 --> 00:37:22.993
Oh, fuck.

744
00:37:24.342 --> 00:37:26.083
Fuck, fuck.
- He's panicking.


745
00:37:26.083 --> 00:37:27.606
I can't.
- He's totally fine.


746
00:37:27.606 --> 00:37:28.912
Shut up.
- I can't fucking do this.


747
00:37:28.912 --> 00:37:30.348
- Go get 'em, baby!
- Woo!


748
00:37:33.525 --> 00:37:34.787
- You're good, pal.

749
00:37:34.787 --> 00:37:36.049
- That's good.

750
00:37:37.486 --> 00:37:39.140
Fuck.

751
00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:41.838
- He can do it. He's
totally gonna get it.


752
00:37:41.838 --> 00:37:43.448
Move.
- Okay, sorry.


753
00:37:45.494 --> 00:37:47.974
Okay. Here he
goes, here he goes.


754
00:37:47.974 --> 00:37:48.975
Okay.

755
00:37:48.975 --> 00:37:49.976
- Stay low! Stay low!

756
00:37:49.976 --> 00:37:51.195
- You got it. Stay low.

757
00:37:51.195 --> 00:37:52.805
Come on, buddy.

758
00:37:52.805 --> 00:37:54.372
Why is he
walking like that?


759
00:37:54.372 --> 00:37:56.853
It's an
athletic stance.


760
00:37:58.071 --> 00:37:59.638
- Yay!
- Go get it, baby!


761
00:37:59.638 --> 00:38:00.900
- Woo!
- Yeah!


762
00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:02.250
- He's got this.

763
00:38:02.250 --> 00:38:03.816
- Yeah.
- Hurry up.


764
00:38:12.173 --> 00:38:13.086
- Hello?

765
00:38:13.957 --> 00:38:15.088
- Go, go, go!

766
00:38:15.088 --> 00:38:16.177
- Come on!

767
00:38:16.177 --> 00:38:17.613
Do something!
- Go!


768
00:38:18.527 --> 00:38:19.528
Come on!

769
00:38:19.528 --> 00:38:20.355
- Hello?

770
00:38:25.838 --> 00:38:27.100
OMG.

771
00:38:28.232 --> 00:38:29.799
- Oh, fuck!

772
00:38:29.799 --> 00:38:31.366
Paisley!
- He put the katana down!


773
00:38:31.366 --> 00:38:32.889
- Where's the gator? Huh?

774
00:38:32.889 --> 00:38:34.630
- He's close.

775
00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:36.588
- Okay, okay, I got you.

776
00:38:36.588 --> 00:38:37.981
I'm gonna get us out of here,
okay? It's gonna be all good.


777
00:38:37.981 --> 00:38:39.765
Stay with me. Let's go.

778
00:38:39.765 --> 00:38:41.114
Go. You got it.

779
00:38:41.114 --> 00:38:42.377
- Oh, Paisley!

780
00:38:42.377 --> 00:38:43.900
- Oh my God!
- Paisley!


781
00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:45.162
- Paisley!
- I totally forgot about her.


782
00:38:45.162 --> 00:38:46.816
Walk with me now, okay?

783
00:38:46.816 --> 00:38:48.687
Oh, oh, shit.

784
00:38:48.687 --> 00:38:49.775
I got her!

785
00:38:49.775 --> 00:38:50.863
- Oh, put her back.

786
00:38:50.863 --> 00:38:51.560
Put her back.
- Ew.


787
00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:52.952
- Ew!

788
00:38:52.952 --> 00:38:54.345
Chad!

789
00:38:54.345 --> 00:38:55.303
- Oh my God.
- Gator, there it is!


790
00:38:55.303 --> 00:38:56.826
- Oh my God, the gator!

791
00:38:58.131 --> 00:38:59.481
- Oh, fuck!

792
00:38:59.481 --> 00:39:00.917
Fuck!

793
00:39:00.917 --> 00:39:02.701
Oh my God.

794
00:39:04.007 --> 00:39:05.095
Oh, shit!

795
00:39:05.095 --> 00:39:06.444
Paisley!

796
00:39:07.576 --> 00:39:08.751
Army crawl.

797
00:39:08.751 --> 00:39:10.753
Army crawl.
- You can do it!


798
00:39:10.753 --> 00:39:12.798
- Come back! Come back!

799
00:39:12.798 --> 00:39:14.409
- Oh, fuck!
- Oh my God!


800
00:39:14.409 --> 00:39:15.975
Stay away from us!

801
00:39:15.975 --> 00:39:16.846
- No!
- Chad!


802
00:39:18.239 --> 00:39:19.065
- Shit!

803
00:39:19.065 --> 00:39:20.415
- Oh, God.

804
00:39:20.415 --> 00:39:21.894
- I'm warning you.

805
00:39:21.894 --> 00:39:24.027
Back up, fucker! Whoa!

806
00:39:24.027 --> 00:39:25.246
- Yes!
- Nice, nice, nice.


807
00:39:25.246 --> 00:39:26.247
Come on.

808
00:39:26.247 --> 00:39:28.074
- Come on, motherfucker.

809
00:39:28.074 --> 00:39:29.293
I'm gonna make some fucking
boots out of your ass!


810
00:39:29.293 --> 00:39:30.294
Hi-yah!

811
00:39:31.861 --> 00:39:33.210
Who's your daddy? Huh?

812
00:39:33.210 --> 00:39:34.777
Say it. Fuck you!

813
00:39:39.651 --> 00:39:40.826
- Come on!
- Go, go!


814
00:39:40.826 --> 00:39:43.176
- You ain't got shit on me.

815
00:39:43.176 --> 00:39:44.265
Back, bitch!

816
00:39:46.615 --> 00:39:47.833
- Get him, baby!
- All right, good.


817
00:39:47.833 --> 00:39:49.444
- Yeah!
- Get him!


818
00:39:49.444 --> 00:39:50.227
- Okay, yes.
- There we go, there we go.


819
00:39:52.229 --> 00:39:54.057
- Oh!
- Oh, whoa, whoa.


820
00:39:54.057 --> 00:39:56.886
- Get back, bitch! Fucking
go back to your home!


821
00:39:56.886 --> 00:39:58.366
Fuck you!

822
00:39:58.366 --> 00:39:59.236
- Oh my God.
- Come on, come on.


823
00:39:59.236 --> 00:40:00.455
Get it!

824
00:40:00.455 --> 00:40:01.934
- Bitch!

825
00:40:05.286 --> 00:40:06.635
- What the?

826
00:40:06.635 --> 00:40:07.505
Whoa.

827
00:40:09.420 --> 00:40:10.639
What the fuck?

828
00:40:12.902 --> 00:40:13.946
Bro!

829
00:40:15.339 --> 00:40:16.514
Bro.

830
00:40:30.049 --> 00:40:31.573
- He was so sweet.

831
00:40:33.531 --> 00:40:34.402
Why?

832
00:40:35.664 --> 00:40:38.057
Why is this happening to me?

833
00:40:41.670 --> 00:40:44.542
We were gonna get
married someday.


834
00:40:47.676 --> 00:40:48.633
- Uh, yeah.

835
00:40:51.201 --> 00:40:53.769
I'm really sorry, Sarah.

836
00:40:53.769 --> 00:40:55.640
- Yeah.

837
00:40:55.640 --> 00:40:57.729
Yeah.

838
00:40:57.729 --> 00:40:59.601
What the fuck are we gonna do?

839
00:40:59.601 --> 00:41:01.429
- I don't know. That thing
didn't even look real.


840
00:41:01.429 --> 00:41:02.343
- Well, it is. You saw
what it just did to Chad.


841
00:41:04.780 --> 00:41:05.911
Sorry, Sarah.

842
00:41:08.305 --> 00:41:10.133
How the fuck are we
gonna get outta here?


843
00:41:10.133 --> 00:41:10.960
- I don't know.

844
00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:12.178
- Sam!

845
00:41:12.178 --> 00:41:13.266
- I'm thinking. I'm thinking.

846
00:41:15.704 --> 00:41:18.184
What if we, like, distracted
it with our food or something?


847
00:41:18.184 --> 00:41:20.012
- Do you think that
thing's gonna want


848
00:41:20.012 --> 00:41:22.145
Gwyneth Paltrow's vegan
tahini dip and some olives?


849
00:41:22.145 --> 00:41:23.364
- Yeah. Maybe.

850
00:41:25.017 --> 00:41:26.279
- Still alive.

851
00:41:29.282 --> 00:41:30.980
- What was that, Sarah?

852
00:41:32.677 --> 00:41:35.724
- Do you think he could
still be alive, like Paisley?


853
00:41:36.507 --> 00:41:37.378
- Who?

854
00:41:38.161 --> 00:41:39.075
- Chad!

855
00:41:40.032 --> 00:41:40.859
- Um.

856
00:41:40.859 --> 00:41:41.947
- Uh.

857
00:41:41.947 --> 00:41:43.340
- Maybe.

858
00:41:43.340 --> 00:41:45.603
Yeah, yeah.

859
00:41:45.603 --> 00:41:46.778
- Probably.

860
00:41:46.778 --> 00:41:47.823
It's looking good.

861
00:41:47.823 --> 00:41:49.128
- Mhm.

862
00:41:49.128 --> 00:41:52.175
There's a big chance.

863
00:41:52.175 --> 00:41:53.219
Yeah.

864
00:41:53.219 --> 00:41:54.786
Yeah.

865
00:41:56.092 --> 00:41:57.267
- Chad! Chad!

866
00:42:00.749 --> 00:42:01.619
- Paisley!
- Christ!


867
00:42:01.619 --> 00:42:03.404
- Oh my God!

868
00:42:03.404 --> 00:42:04.361
- Holy fuck. I completely
forgot about her.


869
00:42:04.361 --> 00:42:05.884
- Help! It's so big!

870
00:42:07.886 --> 00:42:10.280
- No, ew! Get off me!

871
00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:13.283
Get off me!

872
00:42:13.283 --> 00:42:14.458
Get off me!

873
00:42:21.596 --> 00:42:22.901
- What are you doing?

874
00:42:22.901 --> 00:42:23.946
- It's okay.

875
00:42:32.215 --> 00:42:33.216
- Do you see it?

876
00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:36.132
- Oh, no, no.

877
00:42:39.309 --> 00:42:41.485
Wait, look, look,
look. Look, over there.


878
00:42:41.485 --> 00:42:42.965
No, no, no.

879
00:42:44.140 --> 00:42:45.141
- By the basketball hoop.

880
00:42:45.141 --> 00:42:46.708
- Oh, God. Oh, God.

881
00:42:52.888 --> 00:42:54.498
- Oh my God.

882
00:43:05.596 --> 00:43:06.771
- Oh, God. Oh, God.

883
00:43:06.771 --> 00:43:08.817
It's gonna fucking eat her!

884
00:43:08.817 --> 00:43:11.472
- Okay. We need to distract it.

885
00:43:13.169 --> 00:43:15.258
- It's been kind of
nice, just the two of us.


886
00:43:15.258 --> 00:43:18.217
I mean, what do we do?

887
00:43:18.217 --> 00:43:19.784
- The food. The food.

888
00:43:19.784 --> 00:43:22.178
We can distract
it with the food.


889
00:43:22.178 --> 00:43:23.701
The, the, the-

890
00:43:23.701 --> 00:43:25.224
- The dip, the dip!
- The dip shit


891
00:43:25.224 --> 00:43:26.965
that she likes to
eat, that disgusting


892
00:43:26.965 --> 00:43:28.097
Gwyneth Paltrow.
- Get it, get it, get it!


893
00:43:28.097 --> 00:43:30.012
LA shit she likes.

894
00:43:30.012 --> 00:43:31.622
Where the hell would you
keep something like that?


895
00:43:31.622 --> 00:43:32.797
Oh, the fridge!

896
00:43:32.797 --> 00:43:34.146
- Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up!

897
00:43:35.713 --> 00:43:37.106
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

898
00:43:37.106 --> 00:43:38.281
- Okay, okay, okay.

899
00:43:38.281 --> 00:43:38.977
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

900
00:43:38.977 --> 00:43:40.196
- What?

901
00:43:40.196 --> 00:43:41.414
- Are you sure?

902
00:43:41.414 --> 00:43:43.286
- Yes. We have to try something.

903
00:43:43.286 --> 00:43:44.287
Okay?

904
00:43:44.287 --> 00:43:45.288
- Okay, okay, okay.

905
00:43:45.288 --> 00:43:45.984
- Don't be a baby.

906
00:43:45.984 --> 00:43:47.290
Okay.

907
00:43:47.290 --> 00:43:48.857
Here we go.

908
00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:53.339
Hey, asshole! Come get it!

909
00:44:00.521 --> 00:44:01.434
Oh! Okay!

910
00:44:18.190 --> 00:44:20.236
- Oh my God, Pearce! Ew!

911
00:44:20.236 --> 00:44:22.499
Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew!

912
00:44:28.026 --> 00:44:31.595
- Huh, shit. Gators
like tahini dip.


913
00:44:31.595 --> 00:44:32.814
Oh, thank God.

914
00:44:32.814 --> 00:44:34.729
- Come on, come on, come on.

915
00:44:34.729 --> 00:44:37.122
Oh, shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit, shit!


916
00:44:37.122 --> 00:44:38.297
- Yeah!
- Come on, come on!


917
00:44:38.297 --> 00:44:39.647
Get in there! Get in the car!

918
00:44:41.170 --> 00:44:42.345
- úShit, shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit, shit,


919
00:44:42.345 --> 00:44:44.086
shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

920
00:44:44.086 --> 00:44:45.522
Oh my God. Oh my God.

921
00:44:45.522 --> 00:44:46.610
- Oh, she made it!

922
00:44:46.610 --> 00:44:48.264
- Yes!
- She made it!


923
00:44:48.264 --> 00:44:49.308
- Okay!

924
00:44:54.357 --> 00:44:56.446
- I think I insulted
it with the dip.


925
00:44:56.446 --> 00:44:57.534
- Oh my God.

926
00:45:01.756 --> 00:45:03.366
Oh my God. The keys.

927
00:45:06.021 --> 00:45:07.283
- Oh. Oh, shit.

928
00:45:07.283 --> 00:45:08.197
Uh.

929
00:45:08.197 --> 00:45:09.720
- Oh my God.

930
00:45:10.678 --> 00:45:12.375
Shit. Oh my God, shit.

931
00:45:12.375 --> 00:45:13.898
Please don't kill me, Mr. Gator.

932
00:45:13.898 --> 00:45:16.945
I promise I'll return
my gator handbag.


933
00:45:20.426 --> 00:45:21.689
Okay, Sarah.

934
00:45:21.689 --> 00:45:24.517
You can do this.
You can do this.


935
00:45:47.236 --> 00:45:48.106
- Oh, God!

936
00:45:49.455 --> 00:45:50.587
Help me move the couch.

937
00:45:50.587 --> 00:45:52.241
- Okay. Okay. Okay.

938
00:45:53.068 --> 00:45:54.025
- Okay.

939
00:45:55.548 --> 00:45:56.375
You got it?

940
00:45:56.375 --> 00:45:58.290
Yeah.

941
00:45:58.290 --> 00:46:00.510
- Okay, okay. Now pull it.

942
00:46:05.254 --> 00:46:06.255
Okay. Okay.

943
00:46:14.437 --> 00:46:16.352
Is it bizarrely quiet?

944
00:46:19.137 --> 00:46:22.097
- Why isn't it trying to get in?

945
00:46:22.097 --> 00:46:23.881
- Maybe the dip killed it.

946
00:46:23.881 --> 00:46:26.623
- I can't fucking believe
this is happening.


947
00:46:26.623 --> 00:46:28.625
- Better them than us, right?

948
00:46:28.625 --> 00:46:29.931
- Yeah.

949
00:46:29.931 --> 00:46:31.410
- Right?

950
00:46:31.410 --> 00:46:32.237
- Are you kidding me?

951
00:46:32.237 --> 00:46:33.108
- Shit, shit.

952
00:46:47.296 --> 00:46:50.821
- I didn't even wanna
fucking be here, okay?


953
00:46:50.821 --> 00:46:52.431
My mom guilt tripped
me into coming


954
00:46:52.431 --> 00:46:54.346
so I could get to
know Chad better.


955
00:46:55.783 --> 00:46:57.828
Why did I listen?
I could be home.


956
00:46:59.221 --> 00:47:02.006
Instead, I am in the
fucking redneck riviera,


957
00:47:02.006 --> 00:47:04.487
hiding from a man-eating gator!

958
00:47:04.487 --> 00:47:07.229
- I didn't even want
to be here either.


959
00:47:07.229 --> 00:47:08.839
- At least they're your friends.

960
00:47:10.101 --> 00:47:10.972
Well, they were.

961
00:47:12.321 --> 00:47:13.626
- I mean, not really.

962
00:47:14.932 --> 00:47:16.804
Those guys are fucking assholes.

963
00:47:16.804 --> 00:47:20.242
I don't even like them, and
they sound dumb as shit.


964
00:47:20.242 --> 00:47:21.809
- So why did you come?

965
00:47:23.071 --> 00:47:23.941
- I, uh...

966
00:47:25.813 --> 00:47:27.075
I heard you were coming.

967
00:47:29.642 --> 00:47:31.427
- But you didn't even know me.

968
00:47:32.907 --> 00:47:35.648
- Chad kinda showed
me a picture of you,


969
00:47:35.648 --> 00:47:39.217
and I may have stalked
your Instagram.


970
00:47:40.566 --> 00:47:41.480
- You did?

971
00:47:42.438 --> 00:47:43.352
- Yeah.

972
00:47:45.180 --> 00:47:47.008
I don't even know why I'm
admitting this right now.


973
00:47:47.008 --> 00:47:49.488
It's probably 'cause we're both
gonna die tonight, but yeah.


974
00:47:52.796 --> 00:47:54.058
- That's kind of creepy.

975
00:47:56.626 --> 00:47:57.932
- Sorry.

976
00:47:57.932 --> 00:47:59.063
- But cute.

977
00:48:35.230 --> 00:48:35.970
- Oh, God.

978
00:49:51.959 --> 00:49:53.134
Hey. Wake up.

979
00:49:53.134 --> 00:49:54.135
- What, what, what, what, what?

980
00:49:54.135 --> 00:49:55.440
- We fell asleep.

981
00:49:56.659 --> 00:49:57.747
- Shit.

982
00:49:57.747 --> 00:49:59.314
Yeah.

983
00:49:59.314 --> 00:50:00.793
- I was hoping this was
all just a nightmare.


984
00:50:00.793 --> 00:50:03.057
- Yeah, me too.

985
00:50:03.057 --> 00:50:06.625
- How long were we out?

986
00:50:06.625 --> 00:50:08.323
- A few hours or so.

987
00:50:10.368 --> 00:50:13.154
- Do you think it's
still out there?


988
00:50:13.154 --> 00:50:16.766
I mean, maybe it gave
up and it went away.


989
00:50:16.766 --> 00:50:17.680
- Maybe.

990
00:50:28.473 --> 00:50:30.954
- Oh. I'll go check.

991
00:50:30.954 --> 00:50:31.912
- Yeah. Thank you.

992
00:50:39.049 --> 00:50:40.616
- Okay.

993
00:50:40.616 --> 00:50:41.530
It's fine.

994
00:50:45.186 --> 00:50:46.100
- What?

995
00:50:47.884 --> 00:50:49.451
Holy shit!

996
00:50:51.932 --> 00:50:53.803
- So?

997
00:50:53.803 --> 00:50:54.586
- Yeah, so it was just
right outside the window,


998
00:50:54.586 --> 00:50:55.457
waiting for us.

999
00:50:55.457 --> 00:50:56.327
- Fuck!

1000
00:50:56.327 --> 00:50:57.502
Yeah.

1001
00:50:57.502 --> 00:50:59.069
- And Sarah, I mean, is she-

1002
00:50:59.069 --> 00:51:01.115
- Dead, arm severed,
keys in her hand.


1003
00:51:01.115 --> 00:51:02.420
I think we're fucked.

1004
00:51:02.420 --> 00:51:04.335
- Well, what is it doing?

1005
00:51:04.335 --> 00:51:05.902
- Oh, you know, it's like
regular alligator stuff,


1006
00:51:05.902 --> 00:51:07.469
just floating through the air,

1007
00:51:07.469 --> 00:51:08.992
circling the corpse
of our best friend.


1008
00:51:08.992 --> 00:51:10.515
- Did you see anyone
else out there?


1009
00:51:10.515 --> 00:51:13.170
- No, no. I'm pretty
sure it ate them all.


1010
00:51:13.170 --> 00:51:13.997
- Fuck!

1011
00:51:13.997 --> 00:51:19.046
- Yeah.

1012
00:51:19.742 --> 00:51:20.395
- The keys.

1013
00:51:20.395 --> 00:51:22.310
- What?

1014
00:51:22.310 --> 00:51:24.399
- The keys. You said the keys
are still in Sarah's hand.


1015
00:51:24.399 --> 00:51:26.357
- Yeah. Her bloody,
disgusting, severed hand.


1016
00:51:26.357 --> 00:51:29.360
- Okay, okay, so then
what if we distract it?


1017
00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:30.840
- We give it her other hand!

1018
00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:31.754
- No.

1019
00:51:33.451 --> 00:51:35.323
We lead it outside and
then we make a break for it


1020
00:51:35.323 --> 00:51:37.325
and we grab the keys and we
just get the fuck out of here.


1021
00:51:37.325 --> 00:51:38.848
- No, no, no, no,
no. That didn't work.


1022
00:51:38.848 --> 00:51:40.371
We already tried that.

1023
00:51:40.371 --> 00:51:41.982
Remember, with the
vegan Goop tahini dip?


1024
00:51:41.982 --> 00:51:43.113
He doesn't want that.
He's too smart for it.


1025
00:51:43.113 --> 00:51:44.985
He wants us. He wants meat.

1026
00:51:44.985 --> 00:51:46.551
- Okay, well, we have
to try something,


1027
00:51:46.551 --> 00:51:48.597
or else we're gonna
end up like them.


1028
00:51:48.597 --> 00:51:50.816
- I like my hands.
I want two hands.


1029
00:51:50.816 --> 00:51:52.993
- I know, so I
need you to think.


1030
00:51:52.993 --> 00:51:54.255
- The Bluetooth speaker!

1031
00:51:54.255 --> 00:51:55.256
- What?

1032
00:51:55.256 --> 00:51:56.083
- Get the speaker.

1033
00:51:56.083 --> 00:51:57.084
Okay.

1034
00:51:57.084 --> 00:51:59.216
- What if we somehow

1035
00:51:59.216 --> 00:52:01.044
connect our phone and
play some loud-ass song


1036
00:52:01.044 --> 00:52:02.393
and we throw it out this door?

1037
00:52:02.393 --> 00:52:04.308
The gator thinks it's us.

1038
00:52:04.308 --> 00:52:05.831
Distracts it long enough
for us to get to the car.


1039
00:52:05.831 --> 00:52:07.050
- Holy shit. That
might actually work.


1040
00:52:07.050 --> 00:52:08.660
You're a genius. I love you.

1041
00:52:08.660 --> 00:52:11.185
Okay, okay, okay. God,
these fucking things.


1042
00:52:12.925 --> 00:52:15.972
Connecting to
King Chad the Sex God iPhone.


1043
00:52:15.972 --> 00:52:17.539
- It's still connected
to his phone!


1044
00:52:17.539 --> 00:52:18.540
- Hurry up!

1045
00:52:18.540 --> 00:52:20.411
- Okay, okay, okay.

1046
00:52:20.411 --> 00:52:22.892
Disconnecting
King Chad the Sex God iPhone.


1047
00:52:22.892 --> 00:52:24.067
- Oh, yeah, nice.

1048
00:52:27.244 --> 00:52:28.419
- Hurry!

1049
00:52:28.419 --> 00:52:29.899
Okay, okay, okay.

1050
00:52:29.899 --> 00:52:31.857
Connecting
to Hope iPhone.


1051
00:52:31.857 --> 00:52:32.858
- Oh, oh, oh.

1052
00:52:32.858 --> 00:52:34.077
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

1053
00:52:34.077 --> 00:52:35.644
Are you ready? 
Are you ready?

1054
00:52:35.644 --> 00:52:37.211
- No, no, no. Get
it, get it, get it.


1055
00:52:37.211 --> 00:52:38.342
- Okay, okay, okay.
Shit, the speaker.


1056
00:52:38.342 --> 00:52:39.169
I got it, I
got it, I got it.

1057
00:52:39.169 --> 00:52:40.344
Are you ready?

1058
00:52:40.344 --> 00:52:41.824
Yeah. Okay, okay, okay.

1059
00:52:41.824 --> 00:52:43.391
- Wait.

1060
00:52:45.828 --> 00:52:47.351
- What was that for?

1061
00:52:47.351 --> 00:52:49.919
- That's in case
you get eaten alive.


1062
00:52:51.355 --> 00:52:53.314
Oh!

1063
00:52:53.314 --> 00:52:55.490
- That's for good luck. I've
never kissed anyone before.


1064
00:52:55.490 --> 00:52:56.404
- Oh!

1065
00:52:57.405 --> 00:52:58.319
Oh. Okay.

1066
00:52:58.319 --> 00:52:59.146
- Let's do it.

1067
00:52:59.146 --> 00:53:00.060
- Right!

1068
00:53:01.104 --> 00:53:03.324

It's a push to start!

okay. Okay, ready?

Oh my God. Oh my God.

1091
00:53:57.856 --> 00:53:58.857
Oh, oh, oh.

1092
00:54:29.105 --> 00:54:31.194
- Holy fucking shit.

1093
00:54:31.194 --> 00:54:34.284
- Sam, get us the
fuck out of here now!


1094
00:54:48.472 --> 00:54:52.215
Battery at

1095
00:55:00.528 --> 00:55:02.617
- Wait. He stopped.

1096
00:55:02.617 --> 00:55:03.487
He's giving up.

1097
00:55:03.487 --> 00:55:04.314
- What?

1098
00:55:04.314 --> 00:55:05.881
- Look!

1099
00:55:05.881 --> 00:55:08.188
Battery
at 1%. Powering down.


1100
00:55:09.667 --> 00:55:11.756
- What the hell am
I even looking at?


1101
00:55:15.151 --> 00:55:17.153
- It shrunk. Oh my God.

1102
00:55:20.591 --> 00:55:21.810
- I can't believe it!

1103
00:55:21.810 --> 00:55:23.028
- How is that even possible?

1104
00:55:23.028 --> 00:55:24.204
- Who cares? We did it.

1105
00:55:24.204 --> 00:55:25.205
We really fucking did it!

1106
00:55:26.380 --> 00:55:27.250
- Mwah.

1107
00:55:28.120 --> 00:55:29.948
- What was that one for?

1108
00:55:29.948 --> 00:55:32.734
- That's a taste of
what's gonna happen later.


1109
00:55:32.734 --> 00:55:33.996
I like
the sound of that.


1110
00:55:33.996 --> 00:55:35.606
Yeah! Woo!

1111
00:55:46.443 --> 00:55:47.836
Sam?

1112
00:55:47.836 --> 00:55:49.054
Yeah?

1113
00:55:49.054 --> 00:55:50.621
That's not my hand.

1114
00:55:50.621 --> 00:55:52.362
Oh, fuck!
