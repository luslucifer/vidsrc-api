I'm rushing to security. Is everything okay?


18
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.590

19
00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.130
-抱歉  -你来得及吗
- Sorry. - Are you gonna make it?


20
00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.340
来得及 体检很快的
Yeah, I think med-checks should go quickly.


21
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.850
我是说午夜前到这里
I meant make it here before midnight.


22
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.140
你还在新加坡呢
You're still in Singapore.


23
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.020
夏威夷比新加坡晚18个小时
Well, Hawaii is 18 hours behind.


24
00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.060
只需要6个小时就能到东京 再花6个小时到火奴鲁鲁
It's just over six hours to Tokyo. Another six to Honolulu.


25
00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.560
所以时间很宽裕
So, I'll be there with plenty of time to spare.


26
00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.150
现在新年前夜 航班延误的话
New Year's Eve. One delay...


27
00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.150
嘿 航班不会延误的
Hey, hey. There won't be any delays.


28
00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.110
等一下
Hold on.


29
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:01.990
抱歉 我今早要迟到了
Hey, sorry. I'm running late this morning.


30
00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:03.200
我只用扫描一下你的工牌
I just need to scan your badge,


31
00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.320
这样你就能快速通过了
and we'll get you through quickly.


32
00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:05.580
感谢
Thank you.


33
00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.410
跟凯莉姑妈说一下 我想吃她做的肉馅羊肚
Now, tell your Aunt Carrie I'm expecting some homemade haggis,


34
00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.660
萝卜和土豆 好吗
neeps, and tatties waiting for me, all right?


35
00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:12.670
-好的  -待会儿见
- Okay. - I'll see you soon.


36
00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.290
爸爸
Hey, Dad.


37
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.170
我真的很开心 我们一家能团聚
I'm really glad that we're doing this.


38
00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.220
很抱歉我们这么久才聚一聚
And I'm sorry that it's taken so long for us to be together.


39
00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.140
没关系 我知道你在学校很忙
Don't apologize. I know you have a busy life at school.


40
00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:24.720
是啊 谢谢你供我读书
Yeah, thanks to you.


41
00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.260
亲爱的 这是当爸爸应该做的
That's my job, sweetheart.


42
00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:28.930
我无论如何都会这么做的
I wouldn't have it any other way.


43
00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.440
差不多吧
Well, almost.


44
00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.120
-托兰斯机长  -很抱歉我迟到了
- Captain Torrance? - Yeah, sorry I'm late.


45
00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.580
没关系 机长 飞行官还没来呢
It's fine, sir. The flight officer hasn't even come by yet.


46
00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.910
-很好  -我是塞缪尔·德勒
- Good. - Oh. Samuel Dele.


47
00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.330
-很高兴认识你  -噢 很高兴认识你
- Nice to meet you. - Oh, nice to meet you.


48
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.340
-新年快乐  -你也是
- Happy New Year. - And to you.


49
00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.750
-你是哪里人  -香港人
- Where are you from? - Uh, Hong Kong, sir.


50
00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.840
我是在民航处参加培训的
Did my training at the Civil Aviation Department.


51
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.470
我听说那里很棒
Oh, yeah. I hear that's a great academy.


52
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.760
你呢 机长 我猜你是英国人
And you, sir? English, I'm guessing?


53
00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.930
天呐 不是 我不会这么自降身价
Hell, no. I wouldn't lower myself.


54
00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.270
不 我是苏格兰人
Nope. I'm Scottish.


55
00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.730
虽然我几年前开过英国皇家空军运输机
Although I did fly RAF Transport years ago.


56
00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.530
那时候 好任务都被英国人包揽了
Back then, all the sexy assignments went to the English blokes.


57
00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:24.740
但我并不介意 因为对于我来说
I didn't mind, though, because for me,


58
00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.160
开重型机比较容易进入航空公司
the heavies were an easy path into the airlines.


59
00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.290
貌似他们要让我们途中经历恶劣天气
Well, it looks like they're pushing us through weather.


60
00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:33.370
他们就这个德行
Of course they are.


61
00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.880
先生们 来看看
Gentlemen, let's see.


62
00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.090
119次航班 一共14名乘客
One-hundred and nineteen, fourteen passengers.


63
00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.010
都清楚了吧 还有什么问题吗
Everything cleared. Any questions?


64
00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:44.680
有 沿途天气似乎很恶劣
Yeah. Looks like we're pushing through some serious weather.


65
00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.590
在中国南海这一带
It's converging here over the South China Sea.


66
00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.350
我们注意到了 等你们飞到那里
We're aware of it. By the time you get there,


67
00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.100
-它就移动到内陆了  -如果它没有移动并且持续恶化呢
- it should have moved inland. - What if it sits there and stews?


68
00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.560
我们要向东飞行 然后北上经过吕宋岛吗
We can push out east, come north over Luzon?


69
00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.230
这样飞行时间会延长一小时 额外消耗燃油
That adds an hour and 18K in fuel.


70
00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:59.310
飞机快没油了 我们得缩短路程
The flight's nearly empty, so we need to shorten.


71
00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.190
飞到三万七千英尺 你就不会受影响了
Take it to 37. You'll clear that weather.


72
00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:02.570
祝你们飞行愉快 新年快乐
Good flight. Happy New Year.


73
00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:04.440
新年快乐
Happy New Year.


74
00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.240
我们的平板能像他的一样控制天气吗
Do our iPads control the weather like his does?


75
00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.990
给你
There you go.


76
00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.330
你们好
Hello, gentlemen.


77
00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.000
我叫邦妮 今晚由我来担任乘务长
My name's Bonnie. I'll be your chief tonight.


78
00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.960
-很高兴认识你 邦妮  -很高兴认识你
- Oh. Nice to meet you, Bonnie. - Good to meet you.


79
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.960
机长 麻烦您来廊桥一下
Um, Captain, you're needed in the Jetway.


80
00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.630
-好的  -待会儿见 机长
- Okay. - See you soon, Cap.


81
00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.020
我是托兰斯机长 飞行指挥官 有什么需要吗
Captain Torrance, Flight Commander. How can I help you?


82
00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.980
我们要把逃犯引渡到多伦多
Fugitive extradition to Toronto.


83
00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:36.770
我们在东京下机
We'll be with you as far as Tokyo.


84
00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.940
他全程无法自由活动 我会一直看着他的
He'll remain in constraints and be under my constant supervision.


85
00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:42.650
他很危险吗 他犯什么罪
Well, is he dangerous? What did he do?


86
00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:43.940
15年前犯了谋杀罪
Homicide. 15 years ago.


87
00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:47.950
真没想到啊
Wasn't expecting that.


88
00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.030
我们在巴厘岛抓到了他 他用了假名
We found him in Bali under an alias.


89
00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:51.950
我敢肯定 他一直在那里
And he's been around, I'll say that.


90
00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:55.290
这架飞机没有隔间 他太引人注意了
Yeah, this is a bare flight. You're gonna attract a lot of attention.


91
00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.160
我不想吓到其他乘客
I don't wanna scare the rest of the passengers.


92
00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:58.830
机长 恐怕你不得不这样做了
I'm afraid you're stuck with us, Captain.


93
00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.130
好吧
All right.


94
00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:05.960
麻烦让他离其他乘客远点
Just keep away from everyone else, please.


95
00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:07.010
好的
Copy that.

- Louis Gaspare, 35B. - Mmm-hmm.


111
00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:52.800
他干什么了
What did he do?


112
00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:55.850
咱们知道的越少越好
I'm sure the less we know, the better.


113
00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:59.270
尽量别跟他有交流 就可以了
You know, just keep your interactions with him to a minimum. That's all.


114

飞机配备了救生衣

378
00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:03.940
飞行角度平行于水面
and we're gonna come in parallel to the swells,


379
00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:06.940
缓慢平稳地降落
so we touch down slow and level.

384
00:22:36.430 --> 00:22:37.890
我们应该在这附近

飞行高度过低
Too low terrain.

393
00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:15.470
也许我们降落在水上更好

我们成了一根炸药
We're a stick of dynamite.

一步一个脚印
One minute at a time.


417
00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:15.210
对吧 德勒
Right, Dele?


418
00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:19.890
你大爷的
Fuck.


419
00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:25.100
糟了 机上还有燃料
Hell, we still got fuel.


420
00:25:25.730 --> 00:25:27.480
飞机温度很高
And a hot plane.


421
00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:29.850
快让大家下机 快
Let's get everyone off now. Let's go.


422

大家安静 到前面去

全部人下飞机

430
00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:51.380
我只是想知道这是怎么回事
I just wanna know what...


431
00:25:52.130 --> 00:25:53.790
-别担心你的东西  -深呼吸

Okay, sit down. Fold your arms, like this.


444
00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.500
双臂交叉 坐好
Arms crossed, sit down.


445
00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:59.320
<b>开拓者航空总部  纽约</b>

446
00:26:59.570 --> 00:27:01.150
-119次航班  -稍后说
- Flight 119.  - Uh, I'll call you.


447
00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:02.860
我们目前知道些什么 西德尼
What do we know, Sydney?


448
00:27:02.950 --> 00:27:06.280
长官 飞机在菲律宾西部失联了
Well, sir, we lost it somewhere west of the Philippines.


449
00:27:06.330 --> 00:27:08.740
-失联  -当地凌晨5点16分 这架飞机曾请求
- Lost?  - The plane requested a higher altitude


450
00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:10.450
提升飞行高度
at 5:16 a.m. local.


451
00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:13.870
19分钟23秒后 彻底失联
Nineteen minutes, 23 seconds later, all communication stopped.


452
00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:17.960
当地凌晨5点43分前 马尼拉空中交通管制系统还能在雷达上监测到他们
Manila ATC had them on radar until 5:43 a.m. local


453
00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.720
之后飞机降至两万英尺以下 彻底失联
when the plane dipped below 20,000 feet and lost all contact.


454
00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:23.720
叫戴维·斯卡代过来 现在去
Get me David Scarsdale, right now.


455
00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:25.550
我们有一些伤口和瘀痕
Um, we have some cuts and bruises,


456
00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:27.930
但是 我觉得大家都很不安
but, um, I think everyone's just pretty rattled.


457
00:27:27.970 --> 00:27:29.430
谁的手机有信号
Anyone have cell service?


458
00:27:29.470 --> 00:27:30.470
没有 都没信号
No. No one.


459
00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:33.690
这个犯人怎么办
What do we do about the prisoner?


460
00:27:33.730 --> 00:27:35.400
不知道 我也第一次遇到这种情况
I don't know. That's a new one for me.


461
00:27:38.530 --> 00:27:41.820
我看见他盯着警察的钥匙 我就把钥匙拿走了
I saw him eyeing the officer's keys, so I took them.


462
00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:43.280
他很危险吗
Is he dangerous?


463
00:27:46.950 --> 00:27:48.910
他是因为谋杀罪被引渡的
He's being extradited on a murder charge.


464
00:27:49.790 --> 00:27:51.950
警察...
The officer...


465
00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.910
警察说了 他可能很危险
The officer said, yeah, he might be dangerous.


466
00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:58.040
听着 我们看好他
Look, we just keep an eye on him


467
00:27:58.090 --> 00:28:02.090
不让他接触其他乘客就行 好吗
and keep him separate from the other passengers, okay?


468
00:28:02.130 --> 00:28:03.260
尽力而为
Just try your best.


469
00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:04.680
-好的  -好
- Okay.  - All right.


470
00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:06.840
给 保管好钥匙

好 好
Yeah, okay.


473
00:28:12.890 --> 00:28:14.390
水... 哪儿都没有
Water... nowhere.


474
00:28:16.730 --> 00:28:18.270
-怎么了  -现在什么情况
- What's going on?  - Tell us something.


475
00:28:18.270 --> 00:28:19.650
是啊 我们需要一个交代
Yeah. We need information.


476
00:28:19.690 --> 00:28:21.530
能正面回答我们吗
Can we please get some real answers?


477
00:28:21.570 --> 00:28:23.940
-一定是有什么...  -好了 大家...
- There's gotta be some thing...  - Okay, everybody...


478
00:28:23.950 --> 00:28:27.030
大家... 听我说
Everybody... Listen, listen up.


479
00:28:27.070 --> 00:28:29.780
感谢你们大家的配合
I want to thank you all for your cooperation.


480
00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:31.240
我很抱歉 发生了这样的事故
I'm sorry for what we just had to go through,


481
00:28:31.290 --> 00:28:32.830
我知道大家有很多疑问
and I know you all have questions.


482
00:28:32.910 --> 00:28:34.040
-是的  -对
- Yeah.  - Yeah.


483
00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:35.250
情况是这样
So, here's the situation.


484
00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:38.830
我们被闪电击中了
We got hit by lightning


485
00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:41.800
我们的主电源和通信设备都出了故障
and our main power and comms are down.


486
00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:44.090
好吧 所以目前看来
Okay, so, as of now,


487
00:28:44.130 --> 00:28:45.590
我们没有办法求助
there's no way of calling for help.


488
00:28:45.630 --> 00:28:48.430
-什么 开玩笑吧  -没法求救吗
- What? You're kidding.  - No way? No way?


489
00:28:48.470 --> 00:28:51.140
听好了 大家现在要做的
What I need everybody to do right now, listen up...


490
00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:53.770
-怎么会这样  -就是保持冷静
- How come?  - ...is remain calm.


491
00:28:53.810 --> 00:28:55.810
行吗 等飞机冷却之后
All right? Once the plane cools down,


492
00:28:55.890 --> 00:28:58.480
我们就可以回机舱 把大家的行李拿出来
we're gonna get back on there, we're gonna get our things,


493
00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:00.060
喝点水
get some water


494
00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:01.690
然后我们再商量接下来该怎么办
and we're gonna figure out what we're gonna do.


495
00:29:01.730 --> 00:29:03.190
你知道我们现在在哪吗
Do you know where we are?


496
00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:06.200
嗯 我们猜测大概在菲律宾南部的
Yeah, we think that we're near Davao


497
00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:07.450
达沃大区附近
in the southern Philippines.


498
00:29:08.490 --> 00:29:10.120
-你们猜测  -没错
- You think? - We think.


499
00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:12.660
-那还真可靠  -大家放心
- Very reassuring. - Rest assured,


500
00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:15.370
我和机组成员会尽一切努力
me and the crew are gonna do everything we can to make sure


501
00:29:15.410 --> 00:29:17.790
保证大家能够安全离开这里
that we get you out of here safely.


502
00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:20.330
好吗 行了 感谢大家配合
All right? Okay. Thank you.


503
00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:22.040
好了 跟我来
Okay, come on.


504
00:29:24.510 --> 00:29:25.710
-嘿 特瑞  -嘿
- Hey, Terry. - Hey.


505
00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:27.510
给大家介绍一下 这位是戴维·斯卡代
Everyone, this is David Scarsdale.


506
00:29:27.550 --> 00:29:30.760
他专门处理公司战略和风险管控方面的问题
He specializes in corporate strategy and crisis management.


507
00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:33.180
-新年快乐  -但愿如此吧
- Happy New Year. - Let's hope so.


508
00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:34.720
这是失联前他们最后的位置吗
Is this the last point of contact?


509
00:29:34.770 --> 00:29:35.810
没错
Yes, it is.


510
00:29:35.850 --> 00:29:37.230
这场风暴可真不小啊
That's a hell of a storm.


511
00:29:37.270 --> 00:29:38.890
哪个蠢货派他们飞进风暴里的
What idiot sent them flying through that?


512
00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:40.730
航空协议这么规定
It's airline protocol.


513
00:29:40.770 --> 00:29:42.860
飞机很轻 这是最佳路线
Flight was light. It was the most efficient route.


514
00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:44.610
我以为他们能飞到风暴之上
I thought they could fly above it.


515
00:29:44.650 --> 00:29:47.490
你以为 你他妈以为自己是气象学家吗
You thought? What, are you a fucking meteorologist, too?


516
00:29:47.530 --> 00:29:48.740
你这么做能省多少油
How much fuel did you save?


517
00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:50.530
大概能省一万两千美元
About $12,000.


518
00:29:50.570 --> 00:29:53.410
那恭喜你 真是捡了芝麻 丢了西瓜
Well, congratulations. That's barely tip money on this deal.


519
00:29:53.450 --> 00:29:55.950
时间不等人 我们得争分夺秒
The clock is ticking. Every minute matters.


520
00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.410
要是飞机落海里 或硬着陆
If that plane ditched at sea, or crash landed,


521
00:29:58.460 --> 00:30:01.670
那现在每一分钟都将是生死抉择的时刻 明白吗
we can count those minutes in lives lost or saved. Got it?


522
00:30:01.710 --> 00:30:04.750
好 那我能干什么 请求军队救援 自己派人去
Okay, so, what can I do? Call the military? Use our assets?


523
00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:06.000
最佳选择是什么
What are your best options?


524
00:30:06.010 --> 00:30:07.970
降在这片区域
Well, in that part of the world,


525
00:30:08.050 --> 00:30:09.930
那就只剩一个选择
there's only one option right now.


526
00:30:09.970 --> 00:30:11.130
是什么
What's that?


527
00:30:11.180 --> 00:30:12.340
你最好先把律师支走
You're gonna want the lawyers out of here.


528
00:30:12.390 --> 00:30:13.850
没关系 直说吧
It's fine. Tell me.


529
00:30:15.010 --> 00:30:17.310
自己派人去 我应经开始着手了
Private assets. I'm already into it.


530
00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:19.810
-雇佣兵吗  -特瑞
- Mercenaries? - Terry...


531
00:30:19.850 --> 00:30:21.940
菲律宾可不像阿马尔菲海岸
The Philippines are not the Amalfi Coast.


532
00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:24.730
我现在需要一个新闻报道小组
Now, I need a group working on press releases


533
00:30:24.770 --> 00:30:26.980
提前写好任何可能发生的情况
for every possible scenario.


534
00:30:27.030 --> 00:30:29.360
参考马航370
A ghosting like Malaysia 370.


535
00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:31.910
飞机坠毁 无一生还者
A crash landing with no survivors.


536
00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:33.740
劫持飞机要求赎金
A hijacking with demands.


537
00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:36.540
要是你们跨年夜有自己的事情 全部取消
If you have plans for New Year's Eve, I just canceled them.


538
00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:38.950
再远些 对 一直到底
A little further. Yeah, right to the end.


539
00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:41.330
-尽量拉紧些  -嗯
- Tight as we can. - Yeah.


540
00:30:41.370 --> 00:30:43.420
我们为什么不能待在飞机里
Why can't we just stay inside the plane?


541
00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:46.300
里面安全 且干燥
It's safe and dry.


542
00:30:46.340 --> 00:30:48.710
问得好 先生 您叫...
Well, that's a good question, Mister, uh...


543
00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:50.970
辛克莱 马特·辛克莱
Sinclair. Matt Sinclair.


544
00:30:51.010 --> 00:30:53.930
没有了空调
Well, without air conditioning,


545
00:30:53.970 --> 00:30:55.890
飞机就是个大烤箱
that plane is gonna cook in the sun.


546
00:30:57.520 --> 00:31:02.270
所以我们最好出来 在外面搭好帐篷 享受微风
So, we're better off out here, with the shelter and a breeze.


547
00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:04.940
嘿 你既然过来了 那就进来
Hey, while you're there, you wanna step in,


548
00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:08.150
来搭把手 马特·辛克莱
help secure that, Matt Sinclair?


549
00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:10.440
好了 要是大家自己背包里还有
Okay, if you're in your bags, you find anything like,


550
00:31:10.490 --> 00:31:14.070
杀虫喷雾 防晒霜 食物之类的东西
uh, bug spray, sunscreen, food,


551
00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:16.530
互相分享一下 好吗
please share. All right?


552
00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.200
加斯帕雷先生
Mr. Gaspare.


553
00:31:28.630 --> 00:31:29.630
好吧
Well...


554
00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:34.090
看来我们现在遇到了点麻烦
Looks like we've got ourselves in a bit of a mess here.


555
00:31:37.930 --> 00:31:39.810
所以
And so,


556
00:31:39.850 --> 00:31:42.980
我还不太确定该怎么处理你
I'm not quite sure what we're supposed to do with you.


557
00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:45.400
老实讲 我很意外你到现在还没跑
To be honest, I'm a bit surprised you're still here.


558
00:31:47.190 --> 00:31:48.770
你以为我他妈能蠢到逃进一个
You think I'm fucking stupid enough to try and escape


559
00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:50.280
自己不知道的丛林吗
in a jungle I don't know?


560
00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:52.860
还带着手铐
In handcuffs?


561
00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:55.200
除非你打算给我解开
Unless you're offering.


562
00:31:58.080 --> 00:31:59.200
恐怕不行
I don't think I can do that.


563
00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:03.330
那我们就没什么好谈的
Then we have nothing to talk about.


564
00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:15.300
操
Shit.


565
00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:20.390
这就是威力十足的闪电
This is what happens when a 40-amp fuse


566
00:32:20.430 --> 00:32:22.430
击中40安培保险丝的下场
gets hit with enough juice to light a city.


567
00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:24.600
你看
Check it out, man.


568
00:32:28.270 --> 00:32:29.560
应答机呢
What about the radio?


569
00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:34.950
我看看 不是吧
Let's see here. Oh, no.


570
00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:37.360
已经烧焦融化了
It's fried, melted.


571
00:32:37.410 --> 00:32:38.450
雷达应答器呢
And the transponder?


572
00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:42.580
不启动很难看出来
It's hard to tell without the power.


573
00:32:48.290 --> 00:32:50.790
要是我们能把隔离汇流条
If we could reroute the isolation bus


574
00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:52.960
转接到重要汇流条上
to the essential bus,


575
00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:57.050
我们就能将蓄电池输出的电流减小
we could draw down more amps from the battery.


576
00:32:57.840 --> 00:32:58.890
理论上可行
In theory.


577
00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:03.180
机长 飞机已经清空了
Captain, plane's fully unloaded


578
00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:06.230
除了尸体和他们的私人财物
except for the, uh, bodies and their personals.


579
00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:11.520
-我来处理吧  -好
- I'll handle it. - Okay.


580
00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:14.400
-嘿 邦妮  -怎么了
- Hey, Bonnie. - Yeah?


581
00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:15.650
我很遗憾伊莎贝拉没能挺过来
Sorry about Isabella.


582
00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:47.870
囚犯个人物品：1把刀 1块手表 1串钥匙 1个钱包

583
00:35:15.650 --> 00:35:17.940
-你在干什么 伙计  -大家都说
- What are you doing, man? - You know what they say.


584
00:35:17.980 --> 00:35:20.240
有视频有真相
No video, didn't happen.


585
00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:25.700
我们都被困在这荒郊野岭
Here we all are. Alone, in the jungle.


586
00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:28.790
完全不知道该怎么离开
No idea of how we're gonna get out.


587
00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:33.040
我们就是糟糕的飞行史上
Survivors of the worst fucking plane ride


588
00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:35.170
最他妈糟糕的飞机之旅的幸存者们
in the history of bad plane rides.


589
00:35:35.210 --> 00:35:38.170
这就是我们可爱的小飞机 从天上坠落下来
There's our lovely plane that decided to fall out of the sky.


590
00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:43.130
我以后再也不坐开拓者航空的飞机了
Trailblazer. Never flying this again.


591
00:35:43.180 --> 00:35:46.050
这是我们的伙食 我们吃完估计能再坚持
There's our snacks. They're gonna last us


592
00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:47.970
一个小时
about an hour.


593
00:35:48.010 --> 00:35:49.100
016
Zero-sixteen.


594
00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:52.430
过程进行了13分钟
Carried that course for 13 minutes.


595
00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:54.980
所以 假设应答机因断电
So, assuming the transponder went down


596
00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:56.520
而无法通讯
with the lightning strike...


597
00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:57.690
我们来做道数学题
Let's do the math.


598
00:35:57.730 --> 00:36:00.980
一共持续了17分钟 速度为每小时三百英里
That's 17 minutes, 300 miles per hour.


599
00:36:01.030 --> 00:36:02.610
两者相乘 结果就是
So, multiplying that out, that's...


600
00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:05.700
糟了
Shit.


601
00:36:05.740 --> 00:36:09.160
搜索范围就得超过一千平方英里
That's over a thousand square miles' search radius.


602
00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:11.290
要在这里找到我们 除非有奇迹发生
It'll take a miracle to find us here.


603
00:36:11.330 --> 00:36:14.080
机长 这座小岛是和乐岛吗
Captain. This island here? Jolo?


604
00:36:15.670 --> 00:36:17.580
这座岛可太 太糟糕了
It's very, very bad.


605
00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:20.460
-什么鬼...  -它是由
- What... - It's run by


606
00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:22.550
分裂分子和犯罪分子管理的
separatists and criminals.


607
00:36:22.590 --> 00:36:24.420
这里没有政府 也没有警察
There's no government or police.


608
00:36:24.430 --> 00:36:27.180
如果我们真的降落在和乐岛上 我们就有危险了
If this is where we landed, we're not safe.


609
00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:32.270
好吧 我们去告诉邦妮一声
All right, we tell Bonnie.


610
00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:36.390
但是我们现在最好守住这个秘密
But let's keep this to ourselves for now.


611
00:36:38.310 --> 00:36:41.270
这儿还有一位神秘先生
And then there's this guy, Mr. Mysterious.


612
00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:43.240
非常友好
Very friendly.


613
00:36:44.450 --> 00:36:47.200
-别  -机长
- No, no, no. - Captain!


614
00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:52.040
别他妈拍我
Keep me out of your fucking videos!


615
00:36:57.750 --> 00:37:00.340
嘿 有撞到头吗 你还好吗
Hey, did you hit your head? Are you okay?


616
00:37:00.590 --> 00:37:01.840
玛丽亚 能帮我拿一下医疗包吗
Maria, can you please get the medic bag?


617
00:37:02.090 --> 00:37:03.000
好
Yep.


618
00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:13.470
特瑞 你得上电视 作为新闻发言人
I'm gonna need you to do an on-camera hit for the press, Terry.


619
00:37:13.470 --> 00:37:16.180
我们会提供一份声明 但是你也需要回答一些问题
We'll have a statement prepared, but you'll need to take questions, too.


620
00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:17.850
我们不应该等再多掌握一些消息吗
Shouldn't we wait till we know a little bit more?


621
00:37:17.850 --> 00:37:19.810
如果我们继续等 等掌握更多消息再公布 就有隐瞒真相的嫌疑
If we wait until we know more, it looks like you're hiding something.


622
00:37:19.810 --> 00:37:21.060
表达出你的关心 谦卑一点
Just show your concern, be humble.


623
00:37:21.110 --> 00:37:22.770
-你知道的  -懂了
- You know the drill. - Got it.


624
00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:26.150
给你
Here you go.


625
00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:27.990
你 该死的天气预报先生
You, Mr. Fuckin' Weatherman.


626
00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:30.120
是时候赎罪了
Time to redeem yourself.


627
00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:31.910
我需要那架飞机的全部信息
I need everything on that aircraft.


628
00:37:31.950 --> 00:37:33.620
飞行时间 维修记录
Flight times, maintenance logs.


629
00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:35.830
最后一次维修飞机的技术人员姓名
Names of the techs who last serviced the plane.


630
00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:37.830
-全都要  -好的 长官 明白
- Everything. - Yes, sir. Got it.


631
00:38:00.350 --> 00:38:01.480
你确定要这样吗 机长
You sure about this, Captain?


632
00:38:02.570 --> 00:38:03.440
不确定
No.


633
00:38:04.110 --> 00:38:05.820
但是我们没有多少选择
But we're running pretty low on options.


634
00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:09.900
我不打算给他戴手铐
Look, I'm not tying him up.


635
00:38:11.870 --> 00:38:14.280
他真跑了 也算是远离其他人 对吧
If he runs, at least he's away from the others, right?


636
00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:26.670
好了
All right.


637
00:38:26.710 --> 00:38:28.470
去告诉大家情况吧
Let's go and break it to the others.


638
00:38:35.890 --> 00:38:38.600
好了 大家听我说
All right, everybody. Listen up.


639
00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:39.850
情况是这样
So, here's our situation.


640
00:38:40.980 --> 00:38:42.850
从我和德勒先生的计算结果来看
Mr. Dele and I, from our calculations,


641
00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:45.770
我们认为我们降落在了
we believe that we have landed on an island


642
00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:47.860
苏禄群岛中的其中一座岛上
somewhere in the Sulu cluster.


643
00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:49.360
我们不知道具体是哪座岛
We don't know which island.


644
00:38:49.450 --> 00:38:52.410
但现在的问题是 这里距离应答机
The problem is the area between where the transponder


645
00:38:52.450 --> 00:38:56.280
被雷击中的位置过远
was struck by lightning to here is so vast


646
00:38:56.330 --> 00:38:58.950
搜救需要花费一些时间
that search and rescue could take some time.


647
00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:00.330
-我的老天  -要花多长时间
- Jesus Christ. - How long is it gonna take?


648
00:39:00.370 --> 00:39:02.830
我们得定量供应食物和水
We're also gonna have to ration food and water.


649
00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:04.710
你下一步计划是什么 发烟雾信号吗
What's your next move? Smoke signals?


650
00:39:04.750 --> 00:39:06.040
你能不能闭嘴啊
Can you just keep it to yourself?


651
00:39:06.090 --> 00:39:07.550
放过他吧 起码他让飞机成功着陆了
Cut him a break. At least he landed the plane.


652
00:39:07.630 --> 00:39:08.760
我们没被撞死
We didn't crash.


653
00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:10.050
但是我们身处一片未知之地
We're in the middle of nowhere though.


654
00:39:10.090 --> 00:39:11.590
-我们被困住了  -是 别闹了 兄弟
- We're stranded. - Yeah, come on, man.


655
00:39:11.630 --> 00:39:14.050
我们又没被撞死 兄弟
We didn't crash, man.


656
00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:17.220
听我说 昨晚上 我们从某种设施的上空飞过
Listen, last night, we flew over some kind of facility.


657
00:39:17.260 --> 00:39:20.600
希望他们有电话或者无线电
I'm hoping they have a phone or a radio.


658
00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:22.440
如果我能到那里 联系到外界
If I can get there, make contact,


659
00:39:23.650 --> 00:39:25.020
我们几个小时后就能获救
we could be rescued in hours.


660
00:39:26.190 --> 00:39:28.610
但在那之前 大家要小心
Until then, I need everybody to be careful


661
00:39:28.650 --> 00:39:30.900
因为我们不知道丛林里面有什么
because we don't know what's going on in that jungle.


662
00:39:30.950 --> 00:39:32.400
-我跟你一起去  -我也去
- I'll go with you. - I will come, too.


663
00:39:32.450 --> 00:39:33.820
谢谢你们
I appreciate it.


664
00:39:33.860 --> 00:39:36.570
但是加斯帕雷先生已经志愿参与了
But Mr. Gaspare has kindly volunteered to come.


665
00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:38.790
-什么  -你要跟戴手铐的人一起去
- What? - You're taking a guy in handcuffs?


666
00:39:39.790 --> 00:39:40.790
很合理
Makes sense.


667
00:40:02.770 --> 00:40:03.770
走吧
Come on.


668
00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:38.640
达图
Datu!


669
00:40:40.350 --> 00:40:41.350
达图
Datu!


670
00:40:44.310 --> 00:40:45.310
达图
Datu!


671
00:40:49.110 --> 00:40:50.110
怎么了 叔叔
What's the matter, Uncle?


672
00:40:50.230 --> 00:40:54.150
昨晚 有架大飞机从我房子上空飞过
Last night a big Kano airplane flew over my house.


673
00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:58.450
靠近老矿区 当时飞得很低 达图
Out by the old mine. It was flying very low, Datu.


674
00:40:58.820 --> 00:41:00.950
-我猜飞机着陆了  -着陆了吗
- To land, I think… - To land?


675
00:41:01.330 --> 00:41:02.450
我觉得是
I think so.


676
00:41:03.410 --> 00:41:04.790
你确定不是军机吗
You sure it wasn't an army plane?


677
00:41:07.630 --> 00:41:09.080
不是军队
It's not the army.


678
00:41:09.630 --> 00:41:11.500
我在马尼拉的探子会警告我们
My spies in Manila would have warned us.


679
00:41:15.010 --> 00:41:16.720
给你家的
For the family.


680
00:41:22.390 --> 00:41:23.850
找到这架飞机
Find this plane.


681
00:41:35.610 --> 00:41:37.360
我们会竭尽全力
Well, we're doing everything we possibly can


682
00:41:35.610 --> 00:41:43.580
开拓者119在中国南海上空消失

683
00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:39.740
找到119次航班 不惜一切代价
to find Flight 119, sparing no expense.


684
00:41:39.780 --> 00:41:42.580
你是否确定这架飞机已经坠毁
Have you determined that the plane has crashed?


685
00:41:42.620 --> 00:41:44.740
不 这不是一个假设
Uh, no, that's not the assumption.


686
00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:46.540
-我们现在几乎没什么信息  -你确定那是爸爸驾驶的飞机吗
- We have very little... - You sure it's Dad's flight?


687
00:41:46.580 --> 00:41:48.120
-我们与...  -我确定
- We are coordinating... - I'm sure.


688
00:41:48.170 --> 00:41:49.500
在该地区进行搜救
...the search and rescue efforts in the region.


689
00:41:49.540 --> 00:41:50.790
不会的
No.


690
00:41:50.830 --> 00:41:52.500
一旦我们有任何新的进展
As soon as we have some updates,


691
00:41:52.540 --> 00:41:54.960
希望是好的进展 我们都将会及时反馈给大家
hopefully some positive news, we'll get right back to you.


692
00:42:04.470 --> 00:42:07.430
我翻了那个警官的包 想找些补给
I peeked through your officer's bag for supplies.


693
00:42:08.940 --> 00:42:11.230
发现了你的折叠刀
I came across your pocketknife.


694
00:42:11.310 --> 00:42:13.650
你之前是军人还是什么
You former military or something'?


695
00:42:13.690 --> 00:42:15.480
伞兵突击队
Groupe des Commandos Parachutistes.


696
00:42:17.110 --> 00:42:18.240
法国外籍军团
French Foreign Legion.


697
00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:20.320
工资和福利都糟透了
Pay and benefits suck,


698
00:42:20.450 --> 00:42:22.780
但只要你有能力 他们不会多问
but they don't ask any questions if you can hack it.


699
00:42:23.740 --> 00:42:24.780
问什么
Questions?


700
00:42:24.830 --> 00:42:26.870
没有什么非黑即白的事 机长
Nothing's black and white, Captain.


701
00:42:26.910 --> 00:42:29.580
我只是在错误的时间出现在了错误的地方
I was just at the wrong place at the wrong time.


702
00:42:29.620 --> 00:42:30.870
没有人会在乎真正发生了什么
No one cares what really happened.


703
00:42:31.790 --> 00:42:35.170
我那时只有18岁 过得糟透了
I was 18 and fucked.


704
00:42:35.210 --> 00:42:39.260
所以 我不想烂在监狱里 就加入了军团
So, rather than, uh, rot in prison, I ran, joined the Legion.


705
00:42:40.340 --> 00:42:42.010
故事结束
End of story.


706
00:42:42.050 --> 00:42:43.140
你是怎么被抓的
How'd you get caught?


707
00:42:45.970 --> 00:42:47.600
算了 那不重要
Forget it. Doesn't matter.


708
00:42:51.060 --> 00:42:52.270
现在我来问你一些问题
Now let me ask you something.


709
00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:55.440
你带着我的刀吗
Did you bring my knife?


710
00:42:57.860 --> 00:42:58.860
抱歉 没有
Sorry, no.


711
00:42:59.570 --> 00:43:00.950
我放回包里了
I left it in the bag.


712
00:43:02.490 --> 00:43:03.780
死去警官的那把枪呢
How about the dead officer's gun?


713
00:43:12.670 --> 00:43:14.750
我们应该快到了
We should be getting close about now.


714

你想干嘛 走开
What do you want? Get out of here.


725
00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:54.500
怎么回事
What the hell is going...


726
00:44:02.300 --> 00:44:03.840
还能更糟吗
Can this get any worse?


727
00:44:08.810 --> 00:44:10.350
这就对了
That's right. That's right.


728

Yeah, she's plugging it in now.


943
01:06:55.500 --> 01:06:57.090
等等 我好像
Wait, I got... I think...


944
01:06:57.130 --> 01:06:58.340
-找到了  -在这
- We got it. We got it. - We're there.


945
01:06:58.380 --> 01:07:00.380
找到了 戴维 找到飞机了
Found it. Dave, found the plane.


946
01:07:01.470 --> 01:07:04.220
和乐岛 托兰斯没说错 准备行动
Jolo island. Torrance was right. Stand by.


947
01:07:07.730 --> 01:07:08.890
就在这
And there it is.


948
01:07:08.930 --> 01:07:11.020
难以相信 飞体居然还是完整的
Can't believe it's intact.


949
01:07:11.060 --> 01:07:13.060
马上给我们的人发坐标
Sending the coordinates to our assets now.


950
01:07:13.110 --> 01:07:15.020
让他们尽快跳伞
They'll drop on-site ASAP.


951
01:07:15.070 --> 01:07:16.270
没必要吧
Well, there's really no need.


952
01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:17.690
他们会联络菲律宾政府的
They'll contact the Philippine government.


953
01:07:17.740 --> 01:07:19.280
想必 他们会让地方当局
Surely, they'll send local authorities


954
01:07:19.320 --> 01:07:21.490
-进行搜救  -没那么简单 特瑞
- with a search and rescue. - It won't be that easy, Terry.


955
01:07:21.530 --> 01:07:22.780
-为什么  -因为
- Why? - Because there is


956
01:07:22.780 --> 01:07:24.370
和乐群岛没有政府
no authority on Jolo island.


957
01:07:24.410 --> 01:07:26.120
分裂分子和民兵说了算
It's run by separatists and militias.


958
01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:28.080
菲律宾部队不会过去的
The Filipino army won't even go there anymore.


959
01:07:28.120 --> 01:07:30.620
他们在那地方吃了很多亏
They got their asses kicked so many times.


960
01:07:30.660 --> 01:07:32.870
我们的人空降这里
Look, the guys will parachute in.


961
01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:35.210
但他们得有支援 才能把所有人救出来
But they're gonna need some help getting everyone out.


962
01:07:45.970 --> 01:07:48.600
村子在这个方向 还有两公里
The village is two kilometers in that direction.


963
01:07:49.060 --> 01:07:50.930
你肯定不能直接要求他们把人放了
You know you can't just ask for them back.


964
01:07:51.940 --> 01:07:53.350
好吧 你是军人
Yeah, well, you're the military man.


965
01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:55.060
我还指望你能有什么主意
I was hoping you'd have some ideas.


966
01:07:57.730 --> 01:07:58.940
兄弟
Ah, man.


967
01:08:00.190 --> 01:08:03.240
谢谢你 帮忙
Thank you... for helping.


968
01:08:12.710 --> 01:08:14.580
军团里的神父曾经说过
A priest in the Legion used to say,


969
01:08:14.630 --> 01:08:17.380
只有在最不寻常的地方才能找到救赎
"Redemption can only be found in the most unusual places."


970
01:08:18.590 --> 01:08:20.420
这地方确实不寻常
Well, this certainly qualifies.


971
01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:38.690
等一下 嘿 别动手
Wait. Hey, hey. Hey, stop!


972
01:08:38.730 --> 01:08:40.070

Stop! What are you doing?

收拾一下降落伞 把尸体拖出来
Go police up the chutes. Get them out the open.


991

收到 谢贝克

正在获取你的视角
Getting your visual up now.


995
01:09:55.270 --> 01:09:57.230
空降点

996
01:09:58.230 --> 01:10:00.400
检查一下飞机 你们尽管看
Let's check the plane. Check. On you.


997
01:10:06.650 --> 01:10:07.820
对 我是特瑞
Yeah, Terry here.


998

999
01:10:18.620 --> 01:10:20.580
过道后方发现两具尸体
We've got two bodies in the rear gallery.


1000
01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:22.040
让我们看看
Give us a look.


1001
01:10:32.930 --> 01:10:34.010
我去
Shit.


1002
01:10:42.230 --> 01:10:43.690
看起来像是机组成员
Looks like it might be crew members.


1003
01:10:43.730 --> 01:10:45.980
现场形势究竟有多紧迫 你之前真的说清楚了吗
Did you properly convey the urgency of the situation?


1004
01:10:46.030 --> 01:10:48.490
-拉上拉链吧 我们知道了  -不能接受
- Zip 'em up. We got 'em. - That's unacceptable.


1005
01:10:49.780 --> 01:10:52.240
不能接受 你转告他们
That is unacceptable. You tell 'em I said that.


1006
01:10:54.490 --> 01:10:55.870
除非我们给予一个营的兵力支持
Filipinos won't send a rescue team


1007
01:10:55.910 --> 01:10:57.580
否则菲律宾那边不同意派出救援队
without a battalion of troops in support.


1008
01:10:57.620 --> 01:10:58.910
而且需要24小时才派出
They're saying 24 hours.


1009
01:10:58.960 --> 01:10:59.960
一向如此
True to form.


1010
01:11:01.500 --> 01:11:03.880
有其他乘客和机组成员的线索吗
Any sign of the passengers or the rest of the crew?


1011
01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:05.420
没有 老板
That's a negative, boss.


1012
01:11:05.460 --> 01:11:07.210
至少现在还没有
At least from what I see right now.


1013
01:11:16.220 --> 01:11:19.190
乘客沦为人质
我们去把他们找回来
布罗迪·托兰斯机长


1014
01:11:22.060 --> 01:11:22.900
天呐
Shit.


1015
01:11:24.110 --> 01:11:26.690
指挥中心 你们看到了吗
Trailblazer CP, you're seeing this, right?


1016
01:11:27.190 --> 01:11:30.030
看来我们得去解救人质了
Looks like we may have a hostage situation on our hands.


1017
01:11:41.420 --> 01:11:42.460
你看见那些船了吗
You see the boats?


1018
01:11:43.210 --> 01:11:44.750
他们在给船加油
They're fueling them up.


1019
01:11:44.790 --> 01:11:46.040
他妈的
Shit.


1020
01:11:47.590 --> 01:11:48.800
他们要把人质带离海岛
Taking them off the island.


1021
01:11:50.920 --> 01:11:52.260
要是人质被带走 就完了
Once they're gone, that's it.


1022
01:12:30.460 --> 01:12:32.590
不能惊动其他人
We have to do this quietly.


1023
01:12:32.630 --> 01:12:34.680
不到万不得已 别开枪
No guns until we absolutely have to.


1024
01:12:37.970 --> 01:12:40.520
什么 这就是你的计划
That's it? That's your plan?


1025
01:12:41.730 --> 01:12:42.850
你有更好的吗
You got a better one?


1026
01:13:08.130 --> 01:13:10.460
我靠
Oh, shit.


1027
01:13:14.550 --> 01:13:16.130
俊玛 他就是俊玛
That's him. That's Junmar.


1028
01:13:17.550 --> 01:13:19.350
车在那里
That's the bus.


1029
01:13:19.390 --> 01:13:20.600
人质应该在房子里
They gotta be in that house.


1030
01:13:22.470 --> 01:13:23.470
这边
This way.


1031
01:14:46.560 --> 01:14:48.430
噢 妈的
Oh, shit.


1032
01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:13.040
动手
Go.


1033
01:15:24.970 --> 01:15:26.970
你们没事吧
Hey, everybody okay?


1034
01:15:27.020 --> 01:15:28.180

1036
01:15:30.100 --> 01:15:33.190
我们给大家解绑 准备出去
We're gonna get everybody freed up and ready to move.


1037
01:15:33.230 --> 01:15:34.310
快
Hurry, hurry, hurry.


1038
01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:37.570
嘿 我在周围警戒
Hey, I'm gonna have a look around.


1039
01:15:37.610 --> 01:15:39.490
好的
Okay.


1040
01:15:39.530 --> 01:15:42.150
现在 我们得回到那辆车上
Now, we're gonna load back up on that bus.


1041
01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:44.660
-我们去哪  -回飞机
- Where are we going? - Back to the plane.


1042
01:15:44.700 --> 01:15:46.120

1043
01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:48.120
没事 我已经和开拓者航空联系上了
It's all right. I've made contact with Trailblazer.


1044
01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:51.040
我还不清楚具体情况 但他们知道我们还活着
I'm not sure what got through, but they know we're alive.


1045
01:15:51.080 --> 01:15:54.710
所以 只要他们找到飞机 我们就有救了 懂吗
So, they find that plane, and they find us. All right?


1046
01:15:54.750 --> 01:15:56.340
-大家都准备好了吗  -准备好了

1056
01:16:36.500 --> 01:16:38.540
路上有一队武装人员
There's a bunch of armed fuckers on the road.


1057
01:16:38.590 --> 01:16:41.510
我们现在开车 全车人都得完蛋
We're gonna get mowed down if we try to drive past them.


1058
01:16:41.550 --> 01:16:44.130
我可以开枪 但会引来更多人
I can engage 'em, but it's just gonna draw more of 'em.


1059
01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:47.680
妈的
Shit.


1060
01:17:00.190 --> 01:17:01.780

1062

我引开他们 我可以牺牲
I'm gonna distract them. I'm gonna give myself up.


1063
01:17:11.790 --> 01:17:14.120
-这就是你的计划  -是啊 不然你有更好的吗
- That's your plan? - Oh, you have a better one?


1064
01:17:16.790 --> 01:17:19.090
听我说 我们别无选择了
Look, we don't have any other choice.


1065
01:17:19.130 --> 01:17:21.460
你要去了 就再也见不到你家人了
You're never gonna see your goddamn family again.


1066
01:17:22.840 --> 01:17:24.090
那他们的家人又怎么办
What about their families?


1067
01:17:25.430 --> 01:17:27.720
我至少得试试 对吧
Look, you know I have to try, right?


1068
01:17:28.470 --> 01:17:29.680
我是机长啊
I mean, I'm the captain.


1069
01:17:29.760 --> 01:17:32.680
这些混蛋不可能杀我的 对他们来说 我可值钱了
These assholes are never gonna kill me. Worth too much to them.


1070
01:17:35.850 --> 01:17:37.850
在这等着 拿好枪
Wait here. Take this.


1071

Datu Junmar.


1078
01:18:49.720 --> 01:18:52.970
另一个飞行员说你离开乘客 去求救了
Other pilot say you leave passengers to call for help.


1079
01:18:54.510 --> 01:18:55.510
结果如何
How that go for you?


1080
01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:01.400
我来是和你说这件事的
I came to talk to you about that.


1081
01:19:02.770 --> 01:19:04.060
我和马尼拉那边沟通过了
I contacted Manila.


1082
01:19:04.820 --> 01:19:06.150
他们派遣了
They send, uh,


1083
01:19:06.190 --> 01:19:09.650
很多搜救士兵
search and rescue for us, lots of soldiers.


1084
01:19:09.700 --> 01:19:12.780
我想让我的乘客们和我一起走 谢谢
So, I'll be having my passengers back, thank you.


1085
01:19:20.120 --> 01:19:21.370
你觉得你过来
You think you come here,


1086
01:19:21.420 --> 01:19:24.130
命令我 让我按照你说的做
speak to me, tell me do what you say.


1087
01:19:26.300 --> 01:19:27.630
你想错了
You think backwards.


1088
01:19:30.840 --> 01:19:32.970
你现在在和乐 托兰斯机长
You in Jolo now, Pilot Torrance.


1089
01:19:35.060 --> 01:19:36.140
不会有人来救援
No rescue coming.


1090
01:19:38.350 --> 01:19:41.020
听着 我们在飞行途中出了状况
Look, we had problems in the air.


1091
01:19:41.900 --> 01:19:43.020
我不得已迫降飞机
I had to land the plane.


1092
01:19:44.860 --> 01:19:46.650
我们这些人只想回家
My people just want to go home.


1093
01:19:46.690 --> 01:19:48.610
-你能理解吧  -他们现在是我的人了
- You can understand. - They're my people now.


1094
01:19:49.780 --> 01:19:50.780
你也一样
You're mine.


1095
01:19:51.490 --> 01:19:52.610
降落的原因不重要
No matter why.


1096
01:19:54.070 --> 01:19:55.870
和乐的一切都归我所有
Everything in Jolo belong to me.


1097
01:19:56.740 --> 01:19:57.950
除非我不想要
Until I don't want.


1098
01:20:04.960 --> 01:20:07.000
小人物死了 大家不会关心
No one care when small man die.


1099
01:20:07.920 --> 01:20:09.760
但要是我杀鸡儆猴 杀掉个大人物呢
But I make example of big man?


1100
01:20:11.050 --> 01:20:12.050
我杀了他的话
I kill him?


1101
01:20:14.510 --> 01:20:16.720
现在他们在乎了 他们想要用钱摆平
Now they care. Now they pay.


1102
01:20:21.140 --> 01:20:22.180
操你的
Fuck you.


1103
01:20:24.980 --> 01:20:25.980
哈詹
Hajan.


1104
01:20:43.540 --> 01:20:45.920
他们是友军 机长 别动
They're friendlies, Captain. Stay where you are. Stay where you are.


1105
01:20:48.750 --> 01:20:49.750
你受伤了吗
You hurt?


1106
01:20:51.340 --> 01:20:52.720
托兰斯机长 你受伤了吗
Captain Torrance, are you hurt?


1107
01:20:53.220 --> 01:20:54.260
我没事
No, I'm okay.


1108
01:20:54.300 --> 01:20:55.720
货物完好无损
We got the package intact.


1109
01:20:55.760 --> 01:20:58.760
东侧道路 主楼 收到吗 谢贝克 通讯结束
Eastern road, main house. How copy? Shellback, out.


1110
01:20:58.810 --> 01:21:00.560
-莱克 你带着货物  -不 等等 把其他人也带上
- Lake, you got the package. - No, wait. Take the others.


1111
01:21:00.600 --> 01:21:02.220
我们找到他们了 行动
Hey, we got them. Let's move!


1112
01:21:05.650 --> 01:21:06.730
行动
Move!


1113
01:21:09.610 --> 01:21:11.190
快点 上车
Move! Move in!


1114
01:21:15.280 --> 01:21:16.820
我来掩护 快点
Got you. Move.


1115
01:21:18.620 --> 01:21:21.290
-大家都没事吧  -大家快趴下
- Everybody okay?  - Everybody, get down!


1116
01:21:21.330 --> 01:21:22.870
开车 快开车
Roll out! Roll out now!


1117
01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:32.000
哈詹
Hajan!


1118
01:21:35.130 --> 01:21:36.130
哈詹
Hajan.


1119
01:21:41.470 --> 01:21:42.810
叫醒岛上所有人
Wake up the island!


1120
01:21:43.730 --> 01:21:45.600
全员出动
Everyone to the plane!


1121
01:21:51.190 --> 01:21:53.940
机长 你被揍得很惨 感觉怎么样
Took a hell of a beating, Captain. How are you feeling?


1122
01:21:53.990 --> 01:21:55.320
还好 谢谢关心
Okay. Okay, thanks.


1123
01:21:56.320 --> 01:21:57.320
你们是谁
Who are you guys?


1124
01:21:57.490 --> 01:21:59.370
我们是开拓者的先遣队
We're Trailblazer's forward advance crew on this.


1125
01:21:59.410 --> 01:22:01.120
约翰·艾萨克 莫 威尔斯 莱克
John Isaac. Mo, Willis, and Lake.


1126
01:22:02.990 --> 01:22:04.290
等等
So, hold on.


1127
01:22:04.330 --> 01:22:05.450
你们是先遣队
You're the advance crew.


1128
01:22:06.710 --> 01:22:08.290
救援队什么时候来
When is the rescue team getting here?


1129
01:22:08.330 --> 01:22:11.840
开拓者最快也要24小时候才能派出搜救队
Twenty-four hours is the best Trailblazer can do,


1130
01:22:11.880 --> 01:22:14.380
于是 很不幸 我们刚才成了你们的救援队
so, unfortunately, we just became the rescue team.


1131
01:22:14.420 --> 01:22:15.550
24小时
Twenty-four hours.


1132
01:22:17.090 --> 01:22:18.760
我们到时候就都死了
We won't be left by then.


1133
01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:21.640
我明白 所以我们要制定一个紧急方案
I understand, and that's why we need to work up a contingency.


1134
01:22:21.680 --> 01:22:24.010
我们确实带了应急资金
Now, we did bring an emergency fund,


1135
01:22:24.060 --> 01:22:26.680
但不足以将我们赎走 所以
but not enough to buy our way off this island. So...


1136
01:22:28.440 --> 01:22:29.980
机长 你觉得我们该怎么办
What do you suggest we do, Captain?


1137
01:22:35.740 --> 01:22:36.860
操
Fuck.


1138
01:22:38.110 --> 01:22:40.280
我有个计划
I got a plan.


1139
01:22:41.410 --> 01:22:46.960
开拓者119失联 仍未找到

1140
01:22:41.870 --> 01:22:43.780
不 这不是一个假设
No, that's not the assumption.


1141
01:22:43.790 --> 01:22:45.740
我们现在几乎没什么信息
We have very little information at present.


1142
01:22:45.750 --> 01:22:47.370
但是 我们与这个地区
However, we are coordinating


1143
01:22:47.410 --> 01:22:49.500
所有的搜救行动协调配合
with all the search and rescue efforts in the region.


1144
01:22:49.540 --> 01:22:50.670
希望...
Hopefully...


1145
01:23:07.560 --> 01:23:08.560
爸爸
Dad.


1146
01:23:11.270 --> 01:23:13.310
我不知道你能不能收到这条信息 但是
I don't know if you'll get this, but...


1147
01:23:16.110 --> 01:23:17.190
我很爱你
I love you so much.


1148
01:23:19.700 --> 01:23:21.740
你是最棒的爸爸
You are the most amazing father.


1149
01:23:22.910 --> 01:23:25.370
对不起 我之前说的不够多
And I'm sorry if I don't say it enough.


1150
01:23:26.910 --> 01:23:28.000
我不知道发生了什么
I don't know what's happening.


1151
01:23:30.040 --> 01:23:31.170
也不知道你受没受伤
Or if you're hurt.


1152
01:23:33.540 --> 01:23:34.630
我好害怕
I'm so scared.


1153
01:23:36.880 --> 01:23:38.210
求求你 快回家吧
So, just please come home.


1154
01:23:48.980 --> 01:23:51.230
指挥中心 我是谢贝克 6号
Trailblazer CP, this is Shellback 6.


1155
01:23:51.270 --> 01:23:54.020
稍等 收到 6号 你们那里什么情况
Let's wait a sec. Copy, 6. What's your status?


1156
01:23:54.060 --> 01:23:56.610
人质安全了 但我们另有计划
Hostages secure, but we've got another plan.


1157
01:23:56.650 --> 01:23:57.940
一个你们不会喜欢的计划
You're not gonna like it.


1158
01:23:57.980 --> 01:23:59.070
大家快点
Come on. Everybody, hurry.


1159
01:23:59.110 --> 01:24:00.360
快点跑
Run, run, run!


1160
01:24:00.400 --> 01:24:01.490
把他们聚集到这里
Hey, gather them here.


1161
01:24:01.650 --> 01:24:03.410
-大家 快点  -聚到这
- Everyone, come on. - Gather around.


1162
01:24:03.570 --> 01:24:05.410
快点
Come on!


1163
01:24:05.450 --> 01:24:07.790
接下来24小时内
Now, there is no full rescue team


1164
01:24:07.790 --> 01:24:11.660
都不会有救援队抵达
coming anytime soon, not for the next 24 hours.


1165
01:24:11.710 --> 01:24:13.290
-什么  -我们不能再等了
- What? - We can't wait.


1166
01:24:13.330 --> 01:24:16.250
他们会想方设法杀掉我们
They are gonna come at us with everything they've got,


1167
01:24:16.290 --> 01:24:18.130
我们活不下去的
and we're not gonna survive.


1168
01:24:18.170 --> 01:24:21.800
我和德勒成功把飞机的电力恢复了
Now, Dele and I managed to get the power back up on the plane.


1169
01:24:23.130 --> 01:24:25.300
我们只有一次机会
We only have one chance.


1170
01:24:25.350 --> 01:24:27.810
我载着大家 飞出去
And that is me flying us out of here in this thing.


1171
01:24:27.850 --> 01:24:29.010
-等等 什么  -这太离谱了
- Wait, wait, wait. What? - No way in hell.


1172
01:24:29.060 --> 01:24:31.180
-我知道  -听我说
- I know. - Listen, listen.


1173
01:24:31.230 --> 01:24:33.480
听着 听我说 都听我说
Listen, listen, listen!


1174
01:24:33.520 --> 01:24:35.190
如果我觉得做不到
If I didn't believe it could be done,


1175
01:24:35.230 --> 01:24:37.610
我就不会让你们再回到那架飞机上
I would not put you guys back on that plane.


1176
01:24:39.360 --> 01:24:41.030
我有女儿
I have a daughter.


1177
01:24:41.070 --> 01:24:43.530
我很想回家
I have every intention of hugging her again


1178
01:24:43.570 --> 01:24:45.110
再抱抱她
and making it home.


1179
01:24:45.160 --> 01:24:48.280
现在 我告诉你们 回家的方法就是坐这架飞机
And I'm telling you that the way home is on this plane.


1180
01:24:49.370 --> 01:24:50.740
我已经带你们走到这一步了
I've got you this far.


1181
01:24:50.790 --> 01:24:53.750
你们再给我多点信任 好吗
I just need you to trust me this one more bit. Okay?


1182
01:24:53.790 --> 01:24:55.460
-好了 飞行前检查  -收到
- All right, preflight checks. - Copy that.


1183
01:24:55.500 --> 01:24:57.080
-所有人 跟上德勒先生  -跟我来 快点
- Everybody, follow Mr. Dele. - Follow me, come on.


1184
01:24:57.130 --> 01:24:59.000
-好吧  -快点
- Okay. All right. - Come on!


1185
01:25:01.760 --> 01:25:03.050
快
Come on!


1186
01:25:03.090 --> 01:25:04.550
谢贝克 还有多长时间
Shellback, how long have I got?


1187
01:25:04.590 --> 01:25:05.720
顶多两分钟
Two minutes tops.


1188
01:25:05.760 --> 01:25:07.470
不能确定已经造成的损坏
Can't be certain the damage already done


1189
01:25:07.510 --> 01:25:09.100
是否会影响飞行特性
won't affect flight characteristics


1190
01:25:09.140 --> 01:25:10.470
是否会导致引擎失灵
or that the engines won't fail.


1191
01:25:10.520 --> 01:25:11.770
谢贝克说能行
Shellback said it can be done.


1192
01:25:11.810 --> 01:25:12.980
他很靠谱
He's the man on the ground.


1193
01:25:13.020 --> 01:25:14.230
缺少适当检查
Short of proper inspection,


1194
01:25:14.350 --> 01:25:15.440
他没资格做决定
he's not qualified to make that determination.


1195
01:25:15.480 --> 01:25:17.060
他们正被追杀 特瑞
They're being hunted, Terry.


1196
01:25:17.110 --> 01:25:18.610
你还在谈检查
And you're talking about inspections?


1197
01:25:18.650 --> 01:25:20.070
他们经历了那么多
After all they've been through,


1198
01:25:20.110 --> 01:25:21.860
想想如果我允许托兰斯起飞
imagine the fallout if I allow Torrance


1199
01:25:21.940 --> 01:25:24.240
导致所有人烧成灰的后果
to fly that plane and incinerate everybody in it.


1200
01:25:24.280 --> 01:25:25.900
想想如果你不允许起飞的后果
Imagine the fallout if you don't.


1201
01:25:25.910 --> 01:25:27.280
确保他们安全上飞机 快
Make sure they get on okay. Come on.


1202
01:25:27.820 --> 01:25:29.070
快跑
Run, run, run!


1203
01:25:33.910 --> 01:25:34.960
每个人赶紧上
Everybody on.


1204
01:25:38.380 --> 01:25:39.670
快点 快走 玛丽亚
Come on. Let's go. Let's go, Maria.


1205
01:25:44.590 --> 01:25:45.720
操
Ah, fuck.


1206
01:25:47.180 --> 01:25:48.550
我们身后有一大群坏蛋追上来了
We're about to have a lot of bad guys up our asses.


1207
01:25:48.600 --> 01:25:50.100
你得抓紧时间 机长
I'm gonna need you to pick up the pace, Cap.


1208
01:25:50.140 --> 01:25:51.390
-好的  -我们有两支护卫队
- All right. - We've got two convoys


1209
01:25:51.430 --> 01:25:52.600
这里 和这里
here and here,


1210
01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:54.600
看起来第三支在后面不远处
and it looks like a third is not far behind.


1211
01:25:54.640 --> 01:25:55.930
好的 我得先修好刹车
All right. I gotta fix this brake first.


1212
01:25:56.020 --> 01:25:58.190
-你帮我争取些时间  -收到
- You gotta buy me some time. - Got it.


1213
01:26:04.240 --> 01:26:05.650
照她说的 快走
Like she said, let's go. Let's go.


1214
01:26:16.920 --> 01:26:18.170
-别停下  -邦妮
- Move! - Bonnie!


1215
01:26:18.210 --> 01:26:19.630
我在这 机长 救命
I got it, Captain! Help!


1216
01:26:20.710 --> 01:26:21.840
别停下
Keep moving.


1217
01:26:28.300 --> 01:26:29.680
扶他上去 我扶不动
Move! I can't get him.


1218
01:26:31.050 --> 01:26:32.100
快
Move, move, move!


1219
01:26:33.220 --> 01:26:35.310
得走了 机长 现在就得走
Time to go, Captain! Time to go now!


1220
01:27:00.330 --> 01:27:01.380
重新装弹
Reloading!


1221
01:27:13.010 --> 01:27:14.010
快走
Moving!


1222
01:27:31.950 --> 01:27:33.200
这些人是谁
Who are these guys?


1223
01:27:53.470 --> 01:27:55.430
谢贝克 谢贝克 给我对讲机
Shellback! Shellback, I need comms.


1224
01:27:56.600 --> 01:27:57.720
已经在队内频道上了
It's already on the team channel.


1225
01:27:59.140 --> 01:28:01.270
一旦我启动引擎 你们有两分钟时间
Once I start the engines, you have two minutes.


1226
01:28:01.480 --> 01:28:03.520
-我会把台阶放下  -收到
- I'll leave the stairs down. - Roger that.


1227
01:28:05.520 --> 01:28:07.320
你知道我不能陪你上飞机
You know I can't get on that plane with you.


1228
01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:10.990
-对吧  -知道 好吧 祝你好运
- Right? - Yeah, okay. Good luck.


1229
01:28:12.490 --> 01:28:14.070
你也是 机长
You too, my capitan.


1230
01:28:47.070 --> 01:28:49.440
想办法帮他包扎 邦妮
Find a way to strap him in, Bonnie.


1231
01:28:49.480 --> 01:28:51.150
所有人 放低身子 好吗
Everybody, stay down, okay?


1232
01:28:51.190 --> 01:28:53.200
再和我一起坚持一会
Just hang with me just a little bit longer.


1233
01:28:53.240 --> 01:28:55.240
不重置舱门关不上
The cabin doors won't seal without a reset.


1234
01:28:55.280 --> 01:28:57.990
打开所有舱门 这样就能平衡
Keep them open, all of them, okay? So they're balanced.


1235
01:28:59.830 --> 01:29:02.870
航电设备打不开 屏幕上什么都不显示
Avionics still shot. Nothing on screens.


1236
01:29:02.910 --> 01:29:05.120
检查了液压装置 看起来状态良好
Checked the hydraulics. They look good.


1237
01:29:05.170 --> 01:29:06.580
好 辅助动力装置还工作吗
Okay. APU working?


1238
01:29:06.630 --> 01:29:08.290
-还工作  -接上了吗
- APU working. - Engaged?


1239
01:29:08.340 --> 01:29:10.090
-接上了  -好
- Engaged. - Okay.


1240
01:29:10.170 --> 01:29:11.170
好 德勒
All right, Dele.


1241
01:29:13.220 --> 01:29:14.470

Start 'em up.


1242
01:29:14.510 --> 01:29:16.220
启动引擎
Starting engines.


1243
01:29:19.470 --> 01:29:22.020
-你没事吧  -没事
- You okay? - Yeah, I'm okay.


1244
01:29:22.430 --> 01:29:23.730
趴下
Get down!


1245
01:29:32.780 --> 01:29:34.610
妈的 我没子弹了
Shit. I'm out of ammo.


1246
01:29:34.650 --> 01:29:36.660
看看运货板 莱克 装弹
Check our pallet. Lake, reloading!


1247
01:29:51.460 --> 01:29:52.550
重新装弹
Reloading!


1248
01:30:09.230 --> 01:30:10.360
妈的
Shit.


1249
01:30:16.700 --> 01:30:17.860
我需要你 德勒
I need you with me, Dele.


1250
01:30:17.910 --> 01:30:18.950
保持专注
Keep your focus in here.


1251
01:30:19.700 --> 01:30:20.950
嘿 要走了
Hey, into the live.


1252
01:30:21.990 --> 01:30:23.240
调个头
Let's turn this baby around.


1253
01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:29.540
瞄准飞行员
Aim for the pilot!


1254
01:30:37.630 --> 01:30:39.180
如果他们打中油箱 我们就完蛋了
They hit our fuel tanks, we're toast.


1255
01:30:50.270 --> 01:30:51.350
我是托兰斯机长
This is Captain Torrance.


1256
01:30:51.400 --> 01:30:52.480
能听到吗
Is anyone there?


1257
01:30:53.610 --> 01:30:55.940
能听到吗 老天爷 我要起飞了
Is anyone there, God damn it? I'm about to take off.


1258
01:30:55.990 --> 01:30:58.700
机长 听我说 飞机不能飞
Captain, you listen to me. That plane stays right where she is.


1259
01:30:58.740 --> 01:30:59.650
-我说清楚了吗  -托兰斯机长
- Am I understood? - Captain Torrance,


1260
01:30:59.660 --> 01:31:02.570
我叫戴维·斯卡代 告诉我你需要什么
my name is David Scarsdale. Tell me what you need.


1261
01:31:02.620 --> 01:31:04.450
我需要定向辅助
I need directional assistance.


1262
01:31:04.490 --> 01:31:07.370
我们没有雷达 没有导航 纯手动
We have no radar, no nav. We are fully manual.


1263
01:31:07.410 --> 01:31:09.920
我觉得最多能飞三百英里
I figure we've got about 300 miles tops.


1264
01:31:09.960 --> 01:31:11.500
帮我找个机场降落
Find me a place to land.


1265
01:31:13.880 --> 01:31:15.250
谢贝克
Shellback.


1266
01:31:15.250 --> 01:31:17.420
你们快上飞机
I need you and your men on the plane now.


1267
01:31:17.470 --> 01:31:19.720
飞机调完头 就起飞
I'm gonna go as soon as we make this turn.


1268
01:31:19.760 --> 01:31:21.090
-上飞机  -收到
- Get to the plane! - Check.


1269
01:31:22.350 --> 01:31:23.350
掩护我
Cover me!


1270
01:31:29.440 --> 01:31:30.770
快上飞机
Let's go!


1271
01:31:39.820 --> 01:31:41.450
这条路够长吗
Do we have enough road?


1272
01:31:41.490 --> 01:31:42.530
必须够长
It's gonna have to be.


1273
01:31:43.320 --> 01:31:44.950
加斯帕雷 快走
Gaspare, move! Move!


1274
01:31:47.950 --> 01:31:49.000
加斯帕雷 快过来
Gaspare, move!


1275
01:31:53.790 --> 01:31:54.920
加斯帕雷
Gaspare!


1276
01:31:54.960 --> 01:31:56.000
快点啊
Come on!


1277
01:32:01.630 --> 01:32:02.840
快上飞机
Let's go!


1278
01:32:04.010 --> 01:32:05.470
左侧机翼无障碍
My wing clear.


1279
01:32:06.060 --> 01:32:07.310
右侧机翼无障碍
My wing is clear.


1280
01:32:10.940 --> 01:32:12.390
不能再拖了 谢贝克
Can't wait any longer, Shellback.


1281
01:32:12.440 --> 01:32:13.440
你那状况如何
What's your status?


1282
01:32:14.940 --> 01:32:16.650
走吧 起飞吧 机长
Go on. Take us up, Captain.


1283
01:32:31.500 --> 01:32:32.750
趴下
Get down!


1284
01:32:52.100 --> 01:32:53.270
我操
What the fuck?


1285
01:33:25.680 --> 01:33:26.680
全速前进
Full throttle.


1286
01:34:08.590 --> 01:34:10.510
机长 你的肩膀
Cap, your shoulder.


1287
01:34:10.550 --> 01:34:12.010
没事
I'm okay.


1288
01:34:16.230 --> 01:34:17.980
右侧引擎要失去动力了
We're losing power, right engine.


1289
01:34:18.020 --> 01:34:19.400
-关闭  -不要关
- Shutting it down. - No!


1290
01:34:19.480 --> 01:34:21.900
我们现在需要最大推力
We need all the thrust we can get.


1291
01:34:21.940 --> 01:34:25.070
-要撞上了  -保住左侧引擎
- We're gonna hit. We're gonna hit. - Save left engine.


1292
01:34:28.160 --> 01:34:29.110
拜托撑住啊
Come on.


1293
01:34:38.080 --> 01:34:40.630
右侧引擎失效 快把它关了
Lost right engine. Shut it down now.


1294
01:34:40.670 --> 01:34:41.750
正在关闭两个引擎
Shutting down two.


1295
01:34:48.840 --> 01:34:50.340
情况有多糟
How bad?


1296
01:34:50.390 --> 01:34:52.600
右侧机翼后缘受损
Right wing's trailing edge is damaged.


1297
01:34:52.640 --> 01:34:54.890
操 好吧 时刻注意右侧机翼
Shit. Okay, just keep an eye on it.


1298
01:34:55.980 --> 01:34:57.560
这里是开拓者119
This is Trailblazer 119.


1299
01:34:58.640 --> 01:35:00.100
我们正在飞行
We're airborne.


1300
01:35:00.150 --> 01:35:01.270
开拓者119
Trailblazer 119,


1301
01:35:01.310 --> 01:35:03.860
我们读取到你的速度是135海里每小时
reading your air speed at 135 knots.


1302
01:35:04.610 --> 01:35:05.820
正在接近失速
Bordering stall rate.


1303
01:35:05.860 --> 01:35:07.490
这是飞机的最快速度了
This is as fast as she'll go.


1304
01:35:07.570 --> 01:35:09.530
你目前的高度是四百英尺
Reading your altitude at 400 feet.


1305
01:35:09.570 --> 01:35:12.280
你必须将飞机拉升到三千英尺 否则会坠机
You need to take her up to 3,000 or she's not staying up.


1306
01:35:12.320 --> 01:35:14.410
速度与高度都做不到
Negative on speed and altitude.


1307
01:35:14.490 --> 01:35:16.750
119 你现在必须拉升

1308
01:35:16.790 --> 01:35:18.790
我们他妈的没有机舱门了
We have no fucking doors.


1309
01:35:18.830 --> 01:35:21.290
机舱内是减压状态 燃料也很少
We're depressurized, we're low on fuel


1310
01:35:21.330 --> 01:35:24.090
还失去了一个引擎 别教我这些我都知道的东西
and we just lost an engine. Now, don't tell me what I already know.


1311
01:35:24.130 --> 01:35:25.630
给我找个机场降落
Find me a place to land.


1312
01:35:29.130 --> 01:35:31.050
正在调取可用机场信息
Pulling up lists of available airfields now.


1313
01:35:31.090 --> 01:35:32.890
显示在大屏幕上
Let's get it up on the screen.


1314
01:35:32.930 --> 01:35:34.800
最佳选择是锡亚西岛
Best option, Siasi Island,


1315
01:35:34.850 --> 01:35:36.470
正南方 50英里处

1316
01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:39.390
调整机头到15度 那里有一个小型机场
Adjust your heading to 15 degrees. There's a small airport there.


1317
01:35:39.810 --> 01:35:40.940
能到那吗
Can you make it?


1318
01:35:41.730 --> 01:35:42.810
我们只能试试看了
We're gonna find out.


1319
01:35:43.900 --> 01:35:46.110
驶出丛林 到海面上了
Jungle cleared. Feet wet.


1320
01:35:49.860 --> 01:35:51.860
能看到锡亚西岛了
Have a visual on Siasi.


1321
01:35:51.910 --> 01:35:54.280
拜托 撑住 宝贝 再飞一点点
Come on. Come on, baby. Just a little bit more.


1322
01:35:55.200 --> 01:35:56.830
右侧失控
Lost right-side control.


1323
01:36:01.920 --> 01:36:02.920
飞机正在下降
Losing altitude.


1324
01:36:10.010 --> 01:36:11.590
看见锡亚西机场跑道了
Have a visual on Siasi runway.


1325
01:36:13.640 --> 01:36:15.680
准备降落
Prepare for landing!


1326
01:36:15.720 --> 01:36:17.640
准备迫降 小心撞击
Brace for impact! Brace for impact!


1327
01:36:30.610 --> 01:36:31.610
反推全开
Full reverse on one.


1328
01:36:32.990 --> 01:36:34.160
扰流板
Speed brakes.


1329
01:36:37.540 --> 01:36:38.950
帮我刹住飞机 德勒
Help me on the brakes, Dele.


1330
01:37:03.730 --> 01:37:04.810
我们没事了吗
Are we okay?


1331
01:37:04.980 --> 01:37:06.100
是的
Yes.


1332
01:37:18.120 --> 01:37:19.160
干得漂亮
Good job.


1333
01:37:19.160 --> 01:37:21.410
干得漂亮 各位 谢谢
Congratulations, everyone. Thank you.


1334
01:37:25.750 --> 01:37:26.960
你还好吗
You okay?


1335
01:37:30.050 --> 01:37:31.550
不算太好
I've had better days.


1336
01:37:34.130 --> 01:37:35.220
一步一个脚印 对吧
One minute at a time, right?


1337
01:37:36.760 --> 01:37:37.840
一步一个脚印
One minute at a time.


1338
01:38:10.590 --> 01:38:12.050
你是个很棒的飞行员 机长
You're a hell of a pilot, Captain.


1339
01:38:12.090 --> 01:38:13.670
-任务完成了吗  -当然
- Mission accomplished? - Absolutely.


1340
01:38:14.380 --> 01:38:15.510
你要见谁
You need to see someone?


1341
01:38:15.550 --> 01:38:17.050
大家继续往前走
Let's keep moving, everybody.


1342
01:38:17.090 --> 01:38:18.260
-你是最棒的机长  -来吧
- You're the captain! - Come on, man.


1343
01:38:33.860 --> 01:38:34.940
机长 你还好吗
Captain, you okay?


1344
01:38:35.990 --> 01:38:37.860
-还行  -你还好吗 机长
- Yeah, I am. - Are you okay, Captain?


1345
01:38:37.910 --> 01:38:40.280
哦 当然 这伤口看起来比实际要严重
Oh, yeah. No, it looks worse than it is.


1346
01:38:40.320 --> 01:38:42.160
可能只是颗跳弹之类的
I think it was just a ricochet or something.


1347
01:38:45.200 --> 01:38:47.870
但愿这个中转地比上一个好点
