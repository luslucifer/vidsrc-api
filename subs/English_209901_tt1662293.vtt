1
00:02:23.054 --> 00:02:25.056
Exactly what
Pastor Kingsman said...


2
00:02:25.223 --> 00:02:27.692
you take a...
off the turnpike, six miles on...


3
00:02:27.851 --> 00:02:30.070
- He doesn't know.
- I didn't think so.


4
00:02:30.228 --> 00:02:32.029
What's it called...
the first road? Lime Road?


5
00:02:32.105 --> 00:02:34.449
- Old Lime Road.
- Rebecca, help your dad out here.


6
00:02:34.607 --> 00:02:36.735
Rebecca.

7
00:02:36.901 --> 00:02:38.903
I think we're lost.

8
00:02:41.656 --> 00:02:43.408
- Sorry, Dad.
- Okay. All right.


9
00:02:43.575 --> 00:02:45.136
- I saw these before.
- Saw what?


10
00:02:45.285 --> 00:02:47.379
This. It all looks the same.
I don't know.


11
00:02:47.537 --> 00:02:49.217
If you took the right,
left at the right...


12
00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:51.409
- You can't even hit me back.
- ... at the right barn.


13
00:02:51.499 --> 00:02:53.376
Or was it the left, left
at the right barn?


14
00:02:53.543 --> 00:02:55.762
Do you remember
when he took the wrong exit?


15
00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.467
- Right?
- We ended up going...


16
00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.350
- No, no, that's not...
- Twice.


17
00:02:59.424 --> 00:03:01.025
- No, that's not true.
- He did it twice.


18
00:03:01.092 --> 00:03:02.685
- It was not properly marked.
- He did it twice.


19
00:03:02.844 --> 00:03:04.804
- It was not properly marked.
- You circled twice.


20
00:03:07.432 --> 00:03:09.105
Okay, ha-ha.
Listen, this is...


21
00:03:09.267 --> 00:03:11.440
that was the right barn.

22
00:03:11.603 --> 00:03:13.363
I'm pretty sure
that this was the right road.


23
00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:14.947
Well, I mean,

24
00:03:15.106 --> 00:03:18.406
it's not that I don't trust your
keen sense of judgment, Captain,


25
00:03:18.568 --> 00:03:21.287
but why don't we just
stop and ask?


26
00:03:23.281 --> 00:03:25.124
There's an idea.

27
00:03:25.283 --> 00:03:27.081
Come on, ask, ask.

28
00:03:27.243 --> 00:03:29.120
Ask, ask, ask, ask.

29
00:03:29.287 --> 00:03:31.289
Ask, ask ask.

30
00:03:31.456 --> 00:03:33.675
I'm gonna go in here
and check it out.


31
00:03:34.834 --> 00:03:37.462
- I listen to my family.
- Wrong turn.


32
00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:40.803
Is there... is there...
is there a fellow there?


33
00:03:40.965 --> 00:03:43.434
Oh, my God.

34
00:03:43.593 --> 00:03:45.937
Oh, my God.

35
00:03:51.768 --> 00:03:53.645
That's enough.

36
00:03:53.811 --> 00:03:55.905
Whew!

37
00:03:56.064 --> 00:03:57.657
Hallelujah!

38
00:03:57.815 --> 00:04:00.159
All right,
there is a word I like to hear.


39
00:04:00.318 --> 00:04:03.743
Let's be saying it
when we find out where we are.


40
00:04:05.782 --> 00:04:08.160
Oh, that's nice.
Isn't that pretty?


41
00:04:09.911 --> 00:04:11.959
For the tenth time
that we've seen it today.


42
00:04:12.121 --> 00:04:13.714
I know.

43
00:04:13.873 --> 00:04:15.841
Sorry, Dan.

44
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.002
I'll go up and check.

45
00:04:19.337 --> 00:04:21.017
- Okay, Christopher.
- Take the boy.


46
00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.349
- Let's go.
- Dad.


47
00:04:23.508 --> 00:04:25.351
See you in a minute.

48
00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.387
Good luck.

49
00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.943
Something tells me
this town won't have a mall.


50
00:04:38.106 --> 00:04:39.983
A mall?

51
00:04:40.149 --> 00:04:43.198
Come on, I'll settle
for indoor bathrooms.


52
00:04:57.583 --> 00:04:59.585
Hello?

53
00:05:04.382 --> 00:05:06.430
Hello! Anyone here?

54
00:05:12.181 --> 00:05:14.183
Hello!

55
00:05:33.036 --> 00:05:35.289
Excuse me.
You folks looking for something?


56
00:05:35.455 --> 00:05:38.755
Sorry. Yeah, we saw
your farm here and...


57
00:05:38.916 --> 00:05:40.259
You lost or something?

58
00:05:40.418 --> 00:05:43.547
Well, to be honest,
I think we may be a little lost.


59
00:05:43.713 --> 00:05:46.091
There's a gas station a couple
miles back the way you came.


60
00:05:46.257 --> 00:05:48.055
You can get a map from them.

61
00:05:48.217 --> 00:05:51.312
Okay. I was just... I was just
looking for a town called Stull.


62
00:05:51.471 --> 00:05:54.725
I think we took a wrong turn
a mile or so back.


63
00:05:54.891 --> 00:05:57.291
So we'll get out of your hair.
Sorry for having bothered you.


64
00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:59.938
You wouldn't be
the new pastor, would you?


65
00:06:00.104 --> 00:06:03.233
Well, actually, yes.
How did you know that?


66
00:06:03.399 --> 00:06:06.118
Well, Pastor Kingsman asked me
to keep an eye out for you,


67
00:06:06.277 --> 00:06:08.405
make sure you're okay.

68
00:06:08.571 --> 00:06:11.370
I'm just so glad
that you made it, Pastor.


69
00:06:11.532 --> 00:06:13.052
I was starting to get
a little worried.


70
00:06:13.076 --> 00:06:14.703
Your moving truck passed by
a couple of hours ago.


71
00:06:14.869 --> 00:06:16.997
Oh, that's good to hear.

72
00:06:17.163 --> 00:06:19.203
I know my wife will certainly
be happy to hear that.


73
00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:20.837
Are we far from town?

74
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.301
Oh, no, no, not at all,
just a couple of miles or so.


75
00:06:25.463 --> 00:06:28.307
I'm Pastor Dan Bramford.
Nice to meet you.


76
00:06:28.466 --> 00:06:30.309
This is my son Christopher.
Christopher.


77
00:06:30.468 --> 00:06:32.812
<i>Oh, got a good QTâ€œ)
on you, boy .</i>


78
00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:34.722
Yeah.

79
00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:37.984
I'm... I'm Mason.

80
00:06:38.142 --> 00:06:39.815
Nice to meet you.

81
00:06:39.977 --> 00:06:41.524
I'll just...

82
00:06:41.687 --> 00:06:44.156
I'll just bring my truck around.
You can follow me.


83
00:06:44.315 --> 00:06:45.988
Okay, that's great.

84
00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:47.652
I told you we weren't lost.

85
00:07:10.133 --> 00:07:11.931
Hey! Honey!

86
00:07:12.093 --> 00:07:14.391
Welcome to Stull!

87
00:07:14.554 --> 00:07:16.147
Oh, no.
You gotta be kidding me.


88
00:07:16.305 --> 00:07:19.354
Give me five.
I got you here.


89
00:07:19.517 --> 00:07:21.360
You did it.

90
00:07:21.519 --> 00:07:24.363
I hate to say I told you so.

91
00:07:24.522 --> 00:07:26.402
- All right.
- He's gonna come by with the truck


92
00:07:26.482 --> 00:07:28.029
and pick us up,
show us into town.


93
00:07:37.827 --> 00:07:40.376
Oh, my God, what the hell
is that guy doing?


94
00:07:40.538 --> 00:07:42.256
I don't know.

95
00:08:12.904 --> 00:08:15.908
Oh. Oh, yuck.

96
00:08:16.073 --> 00:08:18.747
Well, that is just not appropriate
for you to see.


97
00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:20.583
- Eww.
- You, too.


98
00:08:20.745 --> 00:08:23.840
- In the car. In the car.
- Come on, guys.


99
00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:27.673
- Are you folks ready?
- Yeah, we are.


100
00:08:27.835 --> 00:08:29.963
I'll just drive right up there
and wait for you.


101
00:08:30.129 --> 00:08:32.097
Thank you, Mason.

102
00:08:32.256 --> 00:08:35.430
All right, kids just got
their first taste of the country.


103
00:08:50.733 --> 00:08:53.111
We won't need these anymore.

104
00:08:56.989 --> 00:08:58.909
It's not as small
as you thought it was, Rebecca.


105
00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:01.544
- This is Main Street?
- What's that?


106
00:09:01.702 --> 00:09:03.625
- Ice cream?
- Look.


107
00:09:03.788 --> 00:09:07.543
Christopher wants to go there.

108
00:09:22.807 --> 00:09:25.811
- Is that us?
- I think.


109
00:09:27.061 --> 00:09:29.155
- Is that us right there?
- This is...


110
00:09:29.313 --> 00:09:30.833
- Is that it? Oh!
- Are you kidding me?


111
00:09:30.898 --> 00:09:32.024
- That's it.
- Oh.


112
00:09:32.191 --> 00:09:34.193
- Can you believe it?
- Ma'am, I'm sorry


113
00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.408
I didn't get a chance to meet you
back at the farm, but I'm Mason.


114
00:09:36.571 --> 00:09:38.448
Oh, I'm Wendy.

115
00:09:38.614 --> 00:09:40.334
- This is gorgeous.
- Oh my goodness.


116
00:09:40.408 --> 00:09:42.126
I'm glad you like it.

117
00:09:42.285 --> 00:09:44.379
I'm just glad I showed you
where it was.


118
00:09:44.537 --> 00:09:46.414
Oh, my.

119
00:09:46.581 --> 00:09:49.835
Can you... what's...
it's amazing.


120
00:09:51.043 --> 00:09:52.966
Um, hi. Hi.

121
00:09:53.129 --> 00:09:55.097
Excuse me.

122
00:09:55.256 --> 00:09:57.475
Be careful.

123
00:10:02.722 --> 00:10:05.521
Becky... uh, Rebecca.

124
00:10:05.683 --> 00:10:07.936
It's okay, Dad.
You can still call me Becky.


125
00:10:08.102 --> 00:10:11.197
It's... it's really nice.

126
00:10:11.355 --> 00:10:12.857
Yeah.

127
00:10:14.191 --> 00:10:15.943
Big change.

128
00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:18.112
I know that you are gonna
make the most of it.


129
00:10:18.279 --> 00:10:19.997
Excuse me. Hi.
Thank you.


130
00:10:20.156 --> 00:10:21.783
I gotta go help your mom.

131
00:10:21.949 --> 00:10:23.417
I... I'm sorry.
Can you help me?


132
00:10:23.576 --> 00:10:25.296
I'm so confused.
Where are the movers and...


133
00:10:25.369 --> 00:10:27.212
Let me help you.

134
00:10:27.371 --> 00:10:28.964
I don't know what's going on.

135
00:10:29.123 --> 00:10:30.875
Did the movers just leave
everything on the ground?


136
00:10:31.042 --> 00:10:32.589
No, no, no, they were nice fellows.
We just figured


137
00:10:32.752 --> 00:10:34.720
you didn't want any strangers
traipsing through your house.


138
00:10:34.879 --> 00:10:36.480
Some fellows from church
came by to help.


139
00:10:36.547 --> 00:10:38.390
- Pastor Kingsman.
- Oh, Pastor Bramford.


140
00:10:38.549 --> 00:10:40.096
- How are you?
- Good. Good.


141
00:10:40.259 --> 00:10:41.860
I thought you were a mover.
I'm so sorry.


142
00:10:41.886 --> 00:10:43.854
Well, today I'm a mover.
Who knows what I'll be tomorrow?


143
00:10:44.013 --> 00:10:47.859
I know I speak for everybody when I say
we're awfully glad you're here.


144
00:10:48.017 --> 00:10:49.769
- Thank you.
- Well, I think six states,


145
00:10:49.935 --> 00:10:51.778
three children,
countless rest stops...


146
00:10:51.937 --> 00:10:55.066
- I think no one's happier than we are.
- I expect that's true.


147
00:10:55.232 --> 00:10:57.451
- Here, Dan.
- Sure.


148
00:10:57.610 --> 00:10:59.237
- Fragile.
- Yeah, should we?


149
00:10:59.403 --> 00:11:01.201
- Dining room?
- Dining room, gents.


150
00:11:01.364 --> 00:11:04.083
- All right, let's go.
- You be the captain out there.


151
00:11:04.241 --> 00:11:05.868
Captain, I know.
Thank you.


152
00:11:07.912 --> 00:11:11.041
Oh, yeah. Excuse me,
I think that goes into the living room.


153
00:11:11.207 --> 00:11:13.460
Thank you.
Hi, sweetheart.


154
00:11:13.626 --> 00:11:15.799
- Hi.
- Can you believe it?


155
00:11:15.961 --> 00:11:18.430
Um, kitchen.
Thank you.


156
00:11:21.676 --> 00:11:23.223
<i>Okay</i>

157
00:11:24.679 --> 00:11:26.977
- Can you believe it?
- This place is so nice.


158
00:11:27.139 --> 00:11:29.767
- This place is huge.
- I know, right?


159
00:11:29.934 --> 00:11:32.528
- Mom, can I pick out my room?
- Well, yes, after your sisters,


160
00:11:32.687 --> 00:11:34.610
'cause they're older than you,
so they get first choice.


161
00:11:34.772 --> 00:11:36.649
- First choice?
- First choice.


162
00:11:36.816 --> 00:11:38.977
- Second choice.
- Hey, girls, Christopher,


163
00:11:38.984 --> 00:11:40.827
please say hello
to Pastor Kingsman.


164
00:11:40.986 --> 00:11:42.579
The man responsible
for all of this.


165
00:11:42.738 --> 00:11:44.832
Oh, well, I wouldn't say
I'm responsible.


166
00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:47.493
I think a higher power
called you to our little town.


167
00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:49.128
Well, certainly.
Thank you.


168
00:11:49.286 --> 00:11:51.288
It's nice to meet you, girls.

169
00:11:51.455 --> 00:11:53.173
- Nice to meet you.
- Go. Get up there.


170
00:11:53.332 --> 00:11:55.460
- Stop pushing me.
- I'll help.


171
00:11:55.626 --> 00:11:57.549
Stop.

172
00:12:02.174 --> 00:12:03.926
- I like the window in here.
- This room is cool.


173
00:12:04.093 --> 00:12:06.187
I saw it first. I call dibs.

174
00:12:06.345 --> 00:12:07.562
You heard what Mom said.

175
00:12:07.722 --> 00:12:09.442
I'm older than you.
I get first dibs, kiddo.


176
00:12:09.598 --> 00:12:11.475
Second dibs.

177
00:12:11.642 --> 00:12:13.690
Second's better
than the third, you weirdo.


178
00:12:13.853 --> 00:12:16.902
What?
You didn't get the crappy third one.


179
00:13:06.864 --> 00:13:09.617
Damn it.
Let me guess.


180
00:13:09.784 --> 00:13:11.832
Yep. Mine.

181
00:13:40.356 --> 00:13:41.357
Mom!

182
00:13:41.524 --> 00:13:44.198
Oh, thank you so much.

183
00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:48.115
This is incredible.
Everybody's so... so sweet.


184
00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:50.749
- And this kitchen is amazing.
- Well, I'm glad you like it.


185
00:13:50.908 --> 00:13:53.161
I'm not much of a cook myself,
so I have to take your word for it.


186
00:13:53.327 --> 00:13:55.204
- That's not your handiwork?
- Oh, no, no, no.


187
00:13:55.371 --> 00:13:57.419
- That's... that's Mrs. Gordon's.
- Oh.


188
00:13:57.581 --> 00:14:00.050
She... she's pretty famous
for her cakes around here.


189
00:14:00.209 --> 00:14:02.086
- Looks delicious.
- They're good.


190
00:14:02.253 --> 00:14:05.006
Yeah, melt your tongue
right off.


191
00:14:05.172 --> 00:14:07.425
So, Dan,

192
00:14:07.591 --> 00:14:09.351
what do you say
we rip the Band-Aid right off


193
00:14:09.426 --> 00:14:10.946
and get you up
on that pulpit tomorrow?


194
00:14:11.095 --> 00:14:12.972
- Oh. Oh. Oh.
- Oh my goodness, Dan.


195
00:14:13.138 --> 00:14:16.187
- I'm not sure that I'm ready.
- I know it's quick,


196
00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:18.191
but folks are anxious
to meet their new pastor.


197
00:14:18.227 --> 00:14:20.400
Well, you know,
he's got big shoes to fill.


198
00:14:20.563 --> 00:14:22.440
- I'm sure they're gonna miss you a lot.
- No, no, no.


199
00:14:22.606 --> 00:14:25.735
I've been here a number of years.
They're about ready to see me move on.


200
00:14:25.901 --> 00:14:28.996
- No.
- I'm looking forward to retirement.


201
00:14:29.154 --> 00:14:31.998
I think it's about time
we had some new blood around here.


202
00:14:32.157 --> 00:14:34.205
- Oh.
- Well...


203
00:14:34.368 --> 00:14:36.837
- Come on, sweetie.
- What do you say?


204
00:14:36.996 --> 00:14:38.498
Rip the Band
-Aid right off.

205
00:14:38.664 --> 00:14:40.291
- Huh?
- All right.


206
00:14:54.305 --> 00:14:56.478
How's the sermon going?

207
00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:58.642
Oh, fine. Good.

208
00:14:58.809 --> 00:15:01.483
The usual battle.

209
00:15:01.645 --> 00:15:02.988
How are the girls?

210
00:15:03.147 --> 00:15:05.149
They're good.

211
00:15:06.483 --> 00:15:08.326
You did the right thing,
you know.


212
00:15:08.485 --> 00:15:11.159
The house is perfect.

213
00:15:11.322 --> 00:15:14.496
I'm almost finished unpacking
downstairs. It looks so good.


214
00:15:16.201 --> 00:15:18.499
I'm glad you're happy with it.

215
00:15:18.662 --> 00:15:21.336
I think moving is always
hardest on the children.


216
00:15:21.498 --> 00:15:24.217
- Yes, I know.
- The new school, the new friends.


217
00:15:24.376 --> 00:15:26.799
They'll adjust.
You know they will.


218
00:15:26.962 --> 00:15:29.511
I think they're gonna like it.

219
00:15:31.008 --> 00:15:32.851
It's not like we had
that much of a choice.


220
00:15:33.010 --> 00:15:34.887
- No?
- No.


221
00:15:35.054 --> 00:15:36.931
- We have a bigger boss.
- Oh.


222
00:15:37.097 --> 00:15:39.441
He called you to be here.

223
00:15:41.018 --> 00:15:43.737
As long as we're together,
that's all...


224
00:15:43.896 --> 00:15:46.274
- Nothing else matters.
- Nothing else matters.


225
00:15:55.366 --> 00:15:58.745
I'm going with two years.

226
00:15:58.911 --> 00:16:01.414
What, too little?

227
00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:04.174
10 years?
Are you kidding me?


228
00:16:04.333 --> 00:16:07.212
No, they live
for about 45 days.


229
00:16:07.378 --> 00:16:10.803
The stronger ones can live
a little longer, like 60 days.


230
00:16:10.965 --> 00:16:13.593
10 years...
they'd have grey hair.


231
00:16:14.969 --> 00:16:17.893
Yeah, I guess 10 years is kind of
a long time for an ant to live, huh?


232
00:16:18.055 --> 00:16:19.932
Yeah.

233
00:16:20.099 --> 00:16:23.524
Rebecca, do you think
I'll make friends here?


234
00:16:23.686 --> 00:16:25.563
You kidding me?

235
00:16:25.729 --> 00:16:27.902
You? Mr. Personality?

236
00:16:28.065 --> 00:16:30.318
Of course you're gonna
make friends.


237
00:16:30.484 --> 00:16:32.765
Think about how much
a big city slicker kid like you knows


238
00:16:32.861 --> 00:16:34.238
compared to these guys.

239
00:16:34.405 --> 00:16:36.908
Mary, honey.

240
00:16:37.074 --> 00:16:38.826
- Guys.
- What?


241
00:16:38.993 --> 00:16:41.746
- Are they here?
- Mary, come here, please.


242
00:16:41.912 --> 00:16:44.256
- Put that away. Turn off the light.
- Hi. Here.


243
00:16:44.415 --> 00:16:47.259
It's our first night here and I just
wanted to say a little something.


244
00:16:47.418 --> 00:16:49.420
Come on.

245
00:16:52.047 --> 00:16:54.175
Hey.
A big change for us.


246
00:16:54.341 --> 00:16:56.264
And your mother and I
would like you to know


247
00:16:56.427 --> 00:16:58.225
how much we appreciate
the love and support


248
00:16:58.387 --> 00:17:02.358
that each one of you has given us
on our journey.


249
00:17:02.516 --> 00:17:04.610
I think we had a great life
in the city,


250
00:17:04.768 --> 00:17:07.817
but I believe the Lord
has called us here.


251
00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:09.653
He didn't call me.

252
00:17:09.815 --> 00:17:11.783
Okay, all right, He called.

253
00:17:11.942 --> 00:17:14.286
Okay, put our hands together.

254
00:17:14.445 --> 00:17:17.198
Heavenly Father, thank You
for protecting us


255
00:17:17.364 --> 00:17:18.741
on our long journey.

256
00:17:18.907 --> 00:17:21.160
Please, we ask You
to watch over us and guide us...


257
00:18:32.231 --> 00:18:33.778
Wait up for us.

258
00:18:35.984 --> 00:18:37.986
Oh, good morning.

259
00:18:41.532 --> 00:18:42.875
Good morning.
Good morning.


260
00:19:14.857 --> 00:19:16.279
Good morning, friends.

261
00:19:16.441 --> 00:19:17.943
Good morning.

262
00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:20.909
Now before I get started,
I promised Mr. Roberts


263
00:19:21.071 --> 00:19:23.995
that I would mention that we
still need a few volunteers


264
00:19:24.158 --> 00:19:26.252
to help us set up
for tomorrow's summer festival,


265
00:19:26.410 --> 00:19:28.629
so if you have
a little extra time


266
00:19:28.787 --> 00:19:30.505
and want to lend
a helping hand,


267
00:19:30.664 --> 00:19:32.962
please see Carl
after the service.


268
00:19:33.125 --> 00:19:34.843
Please be seated.

269
00:19:41.341 --> 00:19:44.094
I have spent a lot of years

270
00:19:44.261 --> 00:19:46.104
here with you

271
00:19:46.263 --> 00:19:50.143
and I would like to believe
that through all those years


272
00:19:50.309 --> 00:19:53.483
we have built a community
of love and faith.


273
00:19:55.856 --> 00:19:57.733
I would also like to believe

274
00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:01.245
that we have learned
to trust each other.


275
00:20:02.821 --> 00:20:06.041
Now trust is
a very funny thing.


276
00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:10.455
It requires absolute belief
in one's soul, a complete faith.


277
00:20:10.621 --> 00:20:12.919
But it's different than faith.

278
00:20:13.081 --> 00:20:16.301
Trust also obligates
the person that is being trusted


279
00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:18.633
to do the best he can.

280
00:20:18.795 --> 00:20:21.674
And so I am asking you
to trust me


281
00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:23.934
one more time

282
00:20:24.092 --> 00:20:26.094
as I prepare to leave you.

283
00:20:27.763 --> 00:20:30.482
Today we welcome the Bramfords.

284
00:20:30.641 --> 00:20:32.518
Pastor Dan,

285
00:20:32.684 --> 00:20:35.608
his lovely wife Wendy
and their three beautiful children


286
00:20:35.771 --> 00:20:38.024
have all consented to join us.

287
00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:40.864
And I trust
that you will show them


288
00:20:41.026 --> 00:20:42.903
the same love and compassion

289
00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:45.789
that you showed me
so many years ago.


290
00:20:45.948 --> 00:20:47.950
The Bramfords

291
00:20:48.116 --> 00:20:51.086
have made a great sacrifice
to be here with us.


292
00:20:51.245 --> 00:20:54.089
So let us welcome them
with open hearts


293
00:20:54.248 --> 00:20:56.125
and open arms.

294
00:20:56.291 --> 00:20:59.511
Pastor Dan, your people.

295
00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:02.970
Thank you.
Thank you.


296
00:21:07.094 --> 00:21:09.688
Thank you, Pastor Kingsman.

297
00:21:09.846 --> 00:21:12.349
- And good morning, everyone.
- Good morning.


298
00:21:12.516 --> 00:21:14.735
First of all I would like
to thank you


299
00:21:14.893 --> 00:21:18.523
for welcoming my family and I
into your lives.


300
00:21:19.856 --> 00:21:21.858
When I first received the offer

301
00:21:22.025 --> 00:21:24.403
to become your pastor
here in Stull,


302
00:21:24.569 --> 00:21:26.867
my wife Wendy and I

303
00:21:27.030 --> 00:21:29.283
were unsure...

304
00:21:29.449 --> 00:21:31.918
unsure about moving a family

305
00:21:32.077 --> 00:21:34.000
halfway across the country,

306
00:21:34.162 --> 00:21:36.290
unsure about leaving behind

307
00:21:36.456 --> 00:21:39.426
a life that we had come
to know and understand,


308
00:21:39.584 --> 00:21:42.758
unsure about a new adventure.

309
00:21:44.798 --> 00:21:47.426
But in times of unsureness,

310
00:21:47.592 --> 00:21:49.936
in times of great decision,

311
00:21:50.095 --> 00:21:52.939
I put my faith in the Lord,

312
00:21:53.098 --> 00:21:55.066
that He would provide for us,

313
00:21:55.225 --> 00:21:57.694
that He had a plan for us.

314
00:21:59.563 --> 00:22:03.409
I think my faith

315
00:22:03.567 --> 00:22:06.446
was like a rock.

316
00:22:06.611 --> 00:22:10.115
I was reminded of
Matthew, chapter 7, verse 24,


317
00:22:10.282 --> 00:22:12.876
which I would like to read to you
this morning.


318
00:22:16.413 --> 00:22:19.292
"Therefore whosoever heareth
these sayings of mine


319
00:22:19.458 --> 00:22:21.961
and doeth them,

320
00:22:22.127 --> 00:22:25.347
I will liken him
unto a wise man


321
00:22:25.505 --> 00:22:28.429
which built his house
on a rock.


322
00:22:28.592 --> 00:22:30.890
And the rain descended

323
00:22:31.053 --> 00:22:32.930
and the floods came
and the winds blew


324
00:22:33.096 --> 00:22:35.269
and beat upon that house.

325
00:22:35.432 --> 00:22:37.309
And it fell not,

326
00:22:37.476 --> 00:22:40.776
for it was founded upon a rock.

327
00:22:40.937 --> 00:22:43.440
And everyone that heareth
these sayings of mine


328
00:22:43.607 --> 00:22:46.736
and doeth them not
shall be likened to a foolish man


329
00:22:46.902 --> 00:22:49.906
which built his house
upon the sand."


330
00:22:53.658 --> 00:22:55.535
So nice to meet you.

331
00:22:55.702 --> 00:22:57.704
God bless. Thank you.

332
00:23:01.249 --> 00:23:03.627
Thank you.

333
00:23:12.844 --> 00:23:15.222
Not really your scene, huh?

334
00:23:16.681 --> 00:23:18.058
What?

335
00:23:18.225 --> 00:23:19.898
This whole thing.

336
00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:21.687
I saw you inside.
You weren't singing.


337
00:23:21.853 --> 00:23:24.072
And then you left
during the sermon.


338
00:23:24.231 --> 00:23:26.279
I could say the same for you.

339
00:23:26.441 --> 00:23:29.035
Sounds like you were paying
more attention to what I was doing.


340
00:23:29.194 --> 00:23:31.071
Well, maybe,

341
00:23:31.238 --> 00:23:33.240
but that's just 'cause you were
so obviously not into it.


342
00:23:33.407 --> 00:23:35.956
Yeah, you're right.
I'm not much into singing


343
00:23:36.118 --> 00:23:38.246
and just not big
on the whole sermon thing.


344
00:23:38.412 --> 00:23:41.586
- No offense to your dad.
- None taken, trust me.


345
00:23:41.748 --> 00:23:44.592
I saw you and your family
when you got into town yesterday.


346
00:23:44.751 --> 00:23:46.628
I take it y'all met Mason.

347
00:23:46.795 --> 00:23:48.672
Oh, Mason?
He's the farm guy?


348
00:23:48.839 --> 00:23:51.843
Yeah. Yeah, the farm guy.

349
00:23:52.008 --> 00:23:54.978
Okay, so then you were
the guy with the lambs and...


350
00:23:55.137 --> 00:23:57.390
Technically they're sheep.

351
00:23:57.556 --> 00:24:01.402
Wow. Well,
you clean up well.


352
00:24:06.022 --> 00:24:08.571
Maybe I'll see you around
and show you the town.


353
00:24:08.733 --> 00:24:11.782
Yeah, cool.
Yeah, that'd be awesome.


354
00:24:13.989 --> 00:24:15.866
"You clean up well"?

355
00:24:16.032 --> 00:24:18.535
Idiot.

356
00:24:18.702 --> 00:24:20.704
I have a hard time believing

357
00:24:20.871 --> 00:24:23.044
that your boxes are unpacked
and your room is clean.


358
00:24:23.206 --> 00:24:24.628
Huh?

359
00:24:24.791 --> 00:24:27.419
Mom, stop. I'm hungry.
Do we have any food in the house?


360
00:24:27.586 --> 00:24:29.088
You're hungry?
Yeah, there's a little something.


361
00:24:29.254 --> 00:24:30.551
I'm sure you can make do.

362
00:24:30.714 --> 00:24:32.967
- And my boxes are unpacked.
- Uh-huh.


363
00:24:33.133 --> 00:24:35.886
- But define clean.
- Exactly what I thought.


364
00:24:36.052 --> 00:24:37.895
You know I hate
living in the mess, honey.


365
00:24:38.054 --> 00:24:40.898
Relax. It's only been a day.
They're just boxes.


366
00:24:41.057 --> 00:24:43.526
- Breathe.
- I'll breathe when you help me out.


367
00:24:43.685 --> 00:24:45.608
Oh, yeah.

368
00:24:45.770 --> 00:24:48.148
Okay, we are definitely
gonna need an escape plan.


369
00:24:48.315 --> 00:24:49.441
She's driving me nuts.

370
00:24:49.608 --> 00:24:51.610
I swear, if she brings up unpacking
one more time, I'm gonna kill her.


371
00:24:51.776 --> 00:24:54.620
I'm serious. We need a plan.

372
00:24:54.779 --> 00:24:56.656
Okay, like you mean the time
that we told Mom


373
00:24:56.823 --> 00:24:58.823
we were going to Sonia Rosen's
house to sleep over,


374
00:24:58.909 --> 00:25:00.411
so that we could see
the Stone Roses?


375
00:25:00.577 --> 00:25:03.097
Yeah, we probably should have told
Sonia Martin about that plan.


376
00:25:03.121 --> 00:25:05.169
- Somehow I got blamed for that one.
- You did not.


377
00:25:05.332 --> 00:25:08.131
I got it way worse than you.
I was grounded for, like, two months.


378
00:25:08.293 --> 00:25:10.716
Remember? Because I should
have known better.


379
00:25:10.879 --> 00:25:13.553
Yeah, you should have known better.

380
00:25:13.715 --> 00:25:15.843
Hey, what are you eating?
I'm starving.


381
00:25:16.009 --> 00:25:18.228
Just peanut butter and jam
I found on the counter.


382
00:25:18.386 --> 00:25:20.764
Mm, sounds appetizing.

383
00:25:23.058 --> 00:25:25.481
Um, I would not do that
if I were you.


384
00:25:25.644 --> 00:25:27.684
Mom said we're saving that
for after dinner tonight.


385
00:25:27.729 --> 00:25:29.948
It's our first family dinner
in the new home,


386
00:25:30.106 --> 00:25:31.608
blah, blah, blah.

387
00:25:31.775 --> 00:25:33.573
Oh, please.

388
00:25:33.735 --> 00:25:36.363
No, seriously, dude, you know
how Mom gets about that shit.


389
00:25:37.531 --> 00:25:39.625
None for me, thanks,
but when Mom kills you,


390
00:25:39.783 --> 00:25:42.127
- I'll take your purple sweater.
- Fine.


391
00:25:53.505 --> 00:25:56.384
Mm, so good.

392
00:26:04.266 --> 00:26:06.564
Are you okay?

393
00:26:07.561 --> 00:26:10.189
Mary!

394
00:26:10.355 --> 00:26:12.778
Oh, shit.

395
00:26:17.487 --> 00:26:19.489
Oh, my God.
Jesus.


396
00:26:19.656 --> 00:26:21.954
- Are you okay?
- What was that?


397
00:26:22.117 --> 00:26:24.119
I have no idea.

398
00:26:25.912 --> 00:26:27.585
Eww.

399
00:26:29.165 --> 00:26:30.838
Oh.

400
00:26:33.169 --> 00:26:35.513
I can't believe this came out.

401
00:26:38.133 --> 00:26:40.727
- I know.
- Holy shit.


402
00:26:46.433 --> 00:26:49.027
Fuck.

403
00:26:54.107 --> 00:26:56.405
Hi. What are you
doing here?


404
00:26:56.568 --> 00:26:59.538
I told you I was gonna take you
around and show you some stuff.


405
00:26:59.696 --> 00:27:01.073
Oh, yeah.

406
00:27:01.239 --> 00:27:03.116
I just didn't know
you meant today.


407
00:27:03.283 --> 00:27:05.627
Is today bad?

408
00:27:05.785 --> 00:27:07.787
No. Come in.

409
00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:15.178
What happened?

410
00:27:15.337 --> 00:27:17.339
You have no idea.

411
00:27:20.425 --> 00:27:22.678
- Who puts a tooth in a cake?
- Tell me about it.


412
00:27:22.844 --> 00:27:24.687
It cut the crap
out of the roof of my mouth.


413
00:27:26.598 --> 00:27:28.521
This is one of
old Mrs. Gordon's cakes.


414
00:27:28.683 --> 00:27:31.687
A nice lady,
but she's almost 95.


415
00:27:31.853 --> 00:27:33.813
Let's just say you're lucky
this is all you found.


416
00:27:33.897 --> 00:27:35.899
Lucky?

417
00:27:49.329 --> 00:27:51.377
There. No more cake.

418
00:27:51.539 --> 00:27:53.416
So are you ready to go?

419
00:27:53.583 --> 00:27:55.085
Um...

420
00:27:55.251 --> 00:27:58.175
Just go, Becca.
I'm fine. Go. Escape.


421
00:27:58.338 --> 00:28:00.807
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. I'll be fine.


422
00:28:00.965 --> 00:28:03.809
A little weirded out,
but I'm fine.


423
00:28:03.968 --> 00:28:05.970
<i>Okay</i>

424
00:28:07.847 --> 00:28:09.849
Bye.

425
00:29:19.544 --> 00:29:21.592
So, not that this hasn't been great,

426
00:29:21.755 --> 00:29:24.508
it has,

427
00:29:24.674 --> 00:29:27.803
but is there anything
to actually do in town?


428
00:29:27.969 --> 00:29:30.142
This isn't exactly
the big city.


429
00:29:30.305 --> 00:29:34.355
I know it's not the big city,
but there's gotta be something.


430
00:29:34.517 --> 00:29:36.645
There really isn't anything to do.

431
00:29:38.354 --> 00:29:40.732
Well, I mean,

432
00:29:40.899 --> 00:29:43.743
could you give me a chance
to figure that out for myself maybe?


433
00:29:45.069 --> 00:29:46.821
Please?

434
00:29:46.988 --> 00:29:48.740
Fine.

435
00:30:36.871 --> 00:30:39.465
So how long
have you lived here?


436
00:30:39.624 --> 00:30:41.672
I don't know.
A long time.


437
00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:44.678
I guess
you're used to it then...


438
00:30:44.838 --> 00:30:46.840
the whole country thing.

439
00:30:48.299 --> 00:30:50.301
No, you never really
get used to it.


440
00:30:50.468 --> 00:30:52.470
You just sort of adapt.

441
00:30:55.598 --> 00:30:58.647
I wasn't exactly thrilled
about moving here,


442
00:30:58.810 --> 00:31:02.030
but it's kind of nice.

443
00:31:03.565 --> 00:31:05.943
- Afternoon.
- Hello.


444
00:31:07.902 --> 00:31:10.121
I should probably get you home.

445
00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:11.623
What?

446
00:31:11.781 --> 00:31:13.783
I thought we were having fun.

447
00:31:13.950 --> 00:31:15.952
It's not that.

448
00:31:17.245 --> 00:31:19.765
It's just it's getting late.
I don't want your parents worrying.


449
00:31:19.789 --> 00:31:21.211
Oh, please.

450
00:31:21.374 --> 00:31:23.797
Noah.

451
00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:26.679
Noah, Pastor Kingsman
is looking for you.


452
00:31:26.838 --> 00:31:28.385
Tell him I'll be there
in a few.


453
00:31:28.548 --> 00:31:30.346
He wants you now.

454
00:31:31.885 --> 00:31:33.762
I've got to go home.

455
00:31:33.928 --> 00:31:36.056
Home?
You live with Pastor Kingsman?


456
00:31:36.222 --> 00:31:37.599
Noah.

457
00:31:37.765 --> 00:31:39.767
I'll explain later.

458
00:31:41.644 --> 00:31:43.863
Are you gonna be okay
getting home, young lady?


459
00:31:44.022 --> 00:31:46.571
Yeah, sure.

460
00:32:15.845 --> 00:32:17.847
Noah.

461
00:32:27.106 --> 00:32:29.108
Noah.

462
00:32:32.987 --> 00:32:35.331
Has the choice been made?

463
00:32:38.868 --> 00:32:40.870
Noah.

464
00:32:50.046 --> 00:32:53.050
I know you're probably
scared right now.


465
00:32:55.009 --> 00:32:57.011
But you can do this.

466
00:32:58.471 --> 00:33:01.224
You're prepared for this.
You can do it, son.


467
00:33:01.391 --> 00:33:03.894
I'm not your son.

468
00:33:05.311 --> 00:33:07.905
And you have no idea
how I'm feeling right now.


469
00:33:12.735 --> 00:33:14.578
You're right.

470
00:33:14.737 --> 00:33:17.411
I wouldn't pretend to know
how you're feeling.


471
00:33:20.118 --> 00:33:22.371
But you knew
this day was coming.


472
00:33:23.705 --> 00:33:26.128
And there can be
no mistakes... none.


473
00:33:30.628 --> 00:33:34.599
Humble yourself
before the Lord, Noah.


474
00:33:34.757 --> 00:33:38.261
We are His servants.
We are here to do His will.


475
00:33:38.428 --> 00:33:41.602
We should not question
what is beyond our understanding.


476
00:33:43.182 --> 00:33:45.059
Put aside your weaknesses,

477
00:33:45.226 --> 00:33:47.775
and He will give you strength.

478
00:33:47.937 --> 00:33:50.281
Do not get close to them...

479
00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:52.442
to any of them, to her.

480
00:34:00.199 --> 00:34:01.371
Here.

481
00:34:05.204 --> 00:34:07.206
Who is it?

482
00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:11.128
The younger sister... Mary.

483
00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:39.413
- Was it delicious?
- It was delicious.


484
00:34:39.572 --> 00:34:41.449
Yeah, it was delicious.

485
00:34:41.616 --> 00:34:43.493
Oh, hi, honey.

486
00:34:43.659 --> 00:34:45.787
Look, I left a plate for you
in the oven.


487
00:34:45.953 --> 00:34:47.830
How was your day?
Did you have fun?


488
00:34:47.997 --> 00:34:50.750
Rebecca has a boyfriend.
Rebecca has a boyfriend.


489
00:34:50.917 --> 00:34:52.339
He's not my boyfriend.

490
00:34:52.502 --> 00:34:54.743
Well, I sure hope not.
You've only known him a few hours.


491
00:34:54.837 --> 00:34:56.510
- Where's Mary?
- She's upstairs.


492
00:34:56.672 --> 00:34:58.674
She hasn't been
feeling well all day.


493
00:35:00.343 --> 00:35:01.845
Oh, yeah, no problem.
Don't worry about it.


494
00:35:02.011 --> 00:35:04.890
You're welcome for that plate
I left for you in the oven.


495
00:35:06.516 --> 00:35:08.268
Oh, you think that's funny,
do you?


496
00:35:14.524 --> 00:35:16.697
Ooh, wow, you look like shit.

497
00:35:16.859 --> 00:35:19.578
Thanks. I feel like shit.

498
00:35:19.737 --> 00:35:21.614
How's your mouth?

499
00:35:21.781 --> 00:35:23.533
Eh, it's okay.

500
00:35:23.699 --> 00:35:25.542
How was your date with Romeo?

501
00:35:25.701 --> 00:35:29.080
Fine, until that weird
Mason guy found us


502
00:35:29.247 --> 00:35:30.965
and told him to go home.

503
00:35:31.124 --> 00:35:32.842
Guess where home is.

504
00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.718
He lives with Mason?

505
00:35:34.877 --> 00:35:36.379
Pastor Kingsman.

506
00:35:36.546 --> 00:35:38.048
What?

507
00:35:38.214 --> 00:35:40.717
Yeah, exactly.
It was weird.


508
00:35:40.883 --> 00:35:43.306
Nice but weird.

509
00:35:43.469 --> 00:35:46.598
Okay, why don't you start
with the nice?


510
00:35:46.764 --> 00:35:49.984
I don't think I can stomach
the weird just yet.


511
00:39:24.315 --> 00:39:26.784
You do know we have
two separate rooms now, right?


512
00:39:26.942 --> 00:39:29.491
Sorry. I was just so tired.

513
00:39:29.653 --> 00:39:31.075
I didn't feel like...

514
00:39:31.238 --> 00:39:33.286
Walking all the way
down the hall.


515
00:39:33.449 --> 00:39:34.951
Oh, you poor thing.

516
00:39:35.117 --> 00:39:37.495
All that flirting with that Noah guy
must have really taken a toll on you.


517
00:39:37.661 --> 00:39:40.210
Ha-ha.
You feeling better?


518
00:39:40.373 --> 00:39:42.546
Eh, a little bit.

519
00:39:42.708 --> 00:39:45.006
But I've got to get out of this house.
So come on, get up.


520
00:39:45.169 --> 00:39:47.137
Let's go into town,
check out the boys.


521
00:39:47.296 --> 00:39:49.094
I need a little fun.

522
00:39:53.094 --> 00:39:55.214
- What are you doing?
- No, no, it's good.


523
00:39:55.304 --> 00:39:58.103
Oh, no, that doesn't look
very good at all, actually.


524
00:39:58.265 --> 00:40:00.518
- Easy now. Easy.
- What's with all the cookies?


525
00:40:00.684 --> 00:40:02.311
Well, they are supposed to be
for the festival,


526
00:40:02.478 --> 00:40:03.900
if your dad doesn't ruin
them all.


527
00:40:04.063 --> 00:40:05.531
Hey, easy.
I'm trying my best.


528
00:40:05.689 --> 00:40:07.942
Honey, yuck.

529
00:40:08.109 --> 00:40:11.283
Don't give him
all of your mistakes.


530
00:40:11.445 --> 00:40:13.823
- No, no, this is not a mistake.
- He is gonna get sick.


531
00:40:13.989 --> 00:40:15.429
So are you sure
you're gonna make it?


532
00:40:15.491 --> 00:40:17.368
Yeah, I'm fine.
It just hurts to eat.


533
00:40:17.535 --> 00:40:19.879
- Okay, but I want to get out of here.
- I know.


534
00:40:20.037 --> 00:40:23.462
- A masterpiece.
- I'm watching you. That looks...


535
00:40:23.624 --> 00:40:26.252
I'm gonna go to the park
with Pastor Kingsman.


536
00:40:26.419 --> 00:40:28.342
That sounds like
a really good idea, honey.


537
00:40:28.504 --> 00:40:30.848
Yeah, a pastor needs to be
with his people.


538
00:40:31.006 --> 00:40:32.849
Oh, can me and Mary
go to town too?


539
00:40:33.008 --> 00:40:34.688
'Cause we want to walk around
a little bit.


540
00:40:34.718 --> 00:40:36.391
So nobody's gonna
help me out at all?


541
00:40:36.554 --> 00:40:38.602
- No.
- No.


542
00:40:38.764 --> 00:40:40.141
Fine.
Take your brother.


543
00:40:40.307 --> 00:40:42.355
And get him something
other than a cookie to eat.


544
00:40:42.518 --> 00:40:45.067
All right, come on then.
Let's go.


545
00:40:45.229 --> 00:40:47.823
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.


546
00:40:47.982 --> 00:40:50.701
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Out of here. Out of here.


547
00:41:03.330 --> 00:41:05.879
All right, you girls,
make yourself useful.


548
00:41:06.041 --> 00:41:08.260
- Help people out.
- Okay, Dad.


549
00:41:08.419 --> 00:41:10.296
- Hello.
- Hello.


550
00:41:10.463 --> 00:41:12.056
- Hello, Pastor.
- How are you?


551
00:41:12.214 --> 00:41:14.216
- Nice to see you.
- Hello to you too.


552
00:41:14.383 --> 00:41:16.385
- Want to help her out?
- Hi.


553
00:41:26.562 --> 00:41:28.564
Hmm.

554
00:41:30.232 --> 00:41:33.486
Okay. Not bad.
He's kind of cute.


555
00:41:33.652 --> 00:41:35.825
10 seconds.

556
00:41:35.988 --> 00:41:38.241
It took you 10 seconds
to find your mark.


557
00:41:38.407 --> 00:41:40.125
It's a gift.

558
00:41:49.585 --> 00:41:51.462
Hi.

559
00:41:51.629 --> 00:41:54.428
What are you doing?

560
00:41:54.590 --> 00:41:57.184
Well, I'm Mary

561
00:41:57.343 --> 00:41:59.971
and this is my sister Rebecca.

562
00:42:01.847 --> 00:42:03.599
- Smooth.
- Shut up.


563
00:42:09.104 --> 00:42:11.106
So have you lived here long?

564
00:42:29.041 --> 00:42:30.918
- Hi.
- Hey.


565
00:42:31.085 --> 00:42:32.962
Why are we hiding?

566
00:42:33.128 --> 00:42:35.472
We're not hiding.

567
00:42:35.631 --> 00:42:37.929
Well, maybe a little bit.

568
00:42:38.092 --> 00:42:40.220
You want to get out of here?

569
00:42:40.386 --> 00:42:42.809
Actually, there's something
I'd like to show you.


570
00:42:44.181 --> 00:42:46.730
- Right now?
- Yeah. Is that cool?


571
00:42:48.811 --> 00:42:50.779
Yeah, sure.
Let me just go tell Mary.


572
00:42:50.938 --> 00:42:52.110
<i>Okay</i>

573
00:42:56.318 --> 00:42:58.161
What, is that
your kissing both?


574
00:42:58.320 --> 00:43:00.414
- No.
- He's really cute.


575
00:43:00.573 --> 00:43:02.667
Um, I think
he just asked me out.


576
00:43:02.825 --> 00:43:03.917
Nice.

577
00:43:04.076 --> 00:43:05.953
Can you cover for me?

578
00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:08.669
Well, I can,
but it's gonna cost you.


579
00:43:08.831 --> 00:43:12.256
All right, fine. At least one
of us is doing all right.


580
00:43:12.418 --> 00:43:14.420
All right, thanks.

581
00:43:17.590 --> 00:43:19.843
- Hey.
- Hey.


582
00:44:03.761 --> 00:44:05.809
Is it weird?

583
00:44:05.971 --> 00:44:07.848
Ls what weird?

584
00:44:08.015 --> 00:44:09.892
Moving away from it all,

585
00:44:10.059 --> 00:44:12.107
away from your home.

586
00:44:12.269 --> 00:44:14.522
My parents seem really happy.

587
00:44:14.688 --> 00:44:17.066
I think they were tired
of the city.


588
00:44:18.734 --> 00:44:20.907
What about you?

589
00:44:21.070 --> 00:44:23.493
Me? I'm fine, I guess.

590
00:44:23.656 --> 00:44:26.375
I mean, it's different,
but it's okay.


591
00:44:26.533 --> 00:44:28.956
Just okay, huh?

592
00:44:29.953 --> 00:44:31.830
So where are we going?

593
00:44:31.997 --> 00:44:34.671
- You'll see.
- Okay.


594
00:44:40.923 --> 00:44:42.766
So you brought me
all the way out here


595
00:44:42.925 --> 00:44:44.552
to show me an old rusty tower?

596
00:44:44.718 --> 00:44:48.439
This is so much more
than an old rusty tower.


597
00:44:48.597 --> 00:44:49.769
Really?

598
00:44:51.350 --> 00:44:53.728
Yeah, really.

599
00:44:53.894 --> 00:44:56.272
I want to show it to you,
but if you're scared...


600
00:44:56.438 --> 00:44:58.657
Oh, you think that rickety old ladder
that climbs, what,


601
00:44:58.816 --> 00:45:01.194
100 feet in the air
is too scary for me?


602
00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:03.408
Please.

603
00:45:07.533 --> 00:45:09.410
Come on.

604
00:45:09.576 --> 00:45:11.578
What, are you chicken?

605
00:45:15.165 --> 00:45:17.293
Come on.

606
00:45:39.690 --> 00:45:41.567
Oh, my God.

607
00:45:41.734 --> 00:45:43.736
This is beautiful.

608
00:45:44.820 --> 00:45:46.822
I told you.

609
00:45:48.031 --> 00:45:50.830
This is where I come when I want
to get away from everything.


610
00:45:52.619 --> 00:45:55.293
It's kind of special to me.

611
00:45:55.456 --> 00:45:57.504
Well, you weren't kidding.

612
00:45:57.666 --> 00:45:59.668
It's amazing.

613
00:46:00.919 --> 00:46:03.422
And you can see
everything from up here.


614
00:46:04.840 --> 00:46:07.263
Makes you feel like
there is a world beyond here.


615
00:46:08.719 --> 00:46:10.892
There is a world beyond here.

616
00:46:11.054 --> 00:46:13.227
You know what I mean.

617
00:46:25.527 --> 00:46:28.201
Thank you, Noah.

618
00:46:28.363 --> 00:46:30.240
For what?

619
00:46:30.407 --> 00:46:32.660
For taking me here.

620
00:46:32.826 --> 00:46:35.124
I can see
why it's so special to you.


621
00:46:36.163 --> 00:46:38.541
I'm just glad you like it.

622
00:46:47.424 --> 00:46:51.224
So are you gonna stay
here in town?


623
00:46:52.721 --> 00:46:54.598
What do you mean?
I live here.


624
00:46:54.765 --> 00:46:58.144
No, I know you live here,
but I just thought


625
00:46:58.310 --> 00:47:00.390
since your dad's retiring
and everything, maybe you...


626
00:47:00.395 --> 00:47:01.863
My dad?

627
00:47:02.022 --> 00:47:03.899
Pastor Kingsman.

628
00:47:04.066 --> 00:47:06.410
Kingsman's not my dad.

629
00:47:06.568 --> 00:47:08.445
He's not your dad?

630
00:47:08.612 --> 00:47:11.661
But you live with him.

631
00:47:11.824 --> 00:47:13.701
Sorry.
It's none of my business.


632
00:47:13.867 --> 00:47:15.869
No, it's fine.

633
00:47:19.373 --> 00:47:21.421
When I lost my family,

634
00:47:21.583 --> 00:47:24.211
Kingsman took me in.

635
00:47:25.838 --> 00:47:28.091
He's strict,
but he's a good guy.


636
00:47:31.635 --> 00:47:34.559
I get the feeling
he doesn't want us hanging out.


637
00:47:36.139 --> 00:47:38.016
Why would you say that?

638
00:47:38.183 --> 00:47:40.060
Well, that whole thing
with Mason


639
00:47:40.227 --> 00:47:42.104
was a little weird yesterday.

640
00:47:42.271 --> 00:47:44.899
And us hiding from him today...

641
00:47:45.065 --> 00:47:46.942
I just... I feel like
he doesn't like me.


642
00:47:47.109 --> 00:47:49.328
It's not that.

643
00:47:49.486 --> 00:47:51.784
He's just being protective.

644
00:47:51.947 --> 00:47:55.167
He's not so keen
on the whole dating thing.


645
00:47:55.325 --> 00:47:57.202
Oh.

646
00:47:57.369 --> 00:47:59.371
So this is a date?

647
00:48:00.747 --> 00:48:02.124
I... I...

648
00:48:02.291 --> 00:48:04.293
I'm just kidding.

649
00:48:24.229 --> 00:48:26.106
Who is that?

650
00:48:26.273 --> 00:48:27.866
What?

651
00:48:28.025 --> 00:48:29.698
There's a guy down there
watching us.


652
00:48:29.860 --> 00:48:31.032
Where?

653
00:48:35.198 --> 00:48:36.666
We should go.

654
00:48:36.825 --> 00:48:38.293
Why? Who is it?

655
00:48:38.452 --> 00:48:41.706
I don't know. We should just go.
We shouldn't be up here.


656
00:49:18.992 --> 00:49:21.370
Did you think
I wouldn't find out?


657
00:49:21.536 --> 00:49:24.836
You were gonna betray us... all of us.
I will not let that happen.


658
00:49:24.998 --> 00:49:26.559
So I just have to put up
with this shit?


659
00:49:26.667 --> 00:49:29.027
My God, Noah, you've seen it.
You know what it's capable of.


660
00:49:29.044 --> 00:49:30.591
Why can't we stop it?

661
00:49:30.754 --> 00:49:32.677
It is God's will.
We are His servants.


662
00:49:32.839 --> 00:49:34.307
We must do everything we can...

663
00:49:34.466 --> 00:49:36.264
You're a fucking liar.

664
00:49:36.426 --> 00:49:38.520
Stop being such a child!

665
00:49:40.097 --> 00:49:42.941
Yes, we've been lied to.
Yes, we've been told stories...


666
00:49:43.100 --> 00:49:45.523
stories of angels
that will come down from heaven


667
00:49:45.686 --> 00:49:48.189
and slay the demons and send
them to hell and protect us all.


668
00:49:48.355 --> 00:49:51.154
There are no angels!
There is only us.


669
00:49:53.110 --> 00:49:56.284
You know what needs to be done.
And I need to know you'll do it.


670
00:49:57.531 --> 00:49:59.704
There is no other way.

671
00:50:03.870 --> 00:50:06.589
I just wish there was something
I could do to save them.


672
00:50:06.748 --> 00:50:08.750
Do your part.

673
00:50:18.635 --> 00:50:20.137
Oh, goodness. Hello.

674
00:50:20.303 --> 00:50:22.180
Mom, I'm gonna head off, okay?

675
00:50:22.347 --> 00:50:24.315
Oh, you like that, don't you?

676
00:50:24.474 --> 00:50:27.273
All right, well, you can go play
with the other kids.


677
00:50:27.436 --> 00:50:29.313
- Okay, Mom.
- Don't go too far.


678
00:50:29.479 --> 00:50:31.982
Check in with us.

679
00:50:32.149 --> 00:50:33.992
Mmmmm.

680
00:50:34.151 --> 00:50:36.199
I think we should do this
in the backyard.


681
00:50:36.361 --> 00:50:38.238
Hello. How are you?

682
00:50:38.405 --> 00:50:40.328
We're neighbors.
It's so nice to meet you.


683
00:50:40.490 --> 00:50:42.663
- Hello.
- Hi. Nice to see you.


684
00:50:42.826 --> 00:50:44.828
Well, aren't you handsome.

685
00:50:44.995 --> 00:50:47.714
- Hi.
- Hi there. Hi.


686
00:50:49.416 --> 00:50:52.169
Yeah, I got it. I got it.

687
00:50:52.335 --> 00:50:55.009
You did it. Awesome.

688
00:50:56.256 --> 00:50:57.849
Would you like some popcorn?

689
00:51:10.562 --> 00:51:12.690
Ooh!

690
00:51:12.856 --> 00:51:14.574
Was that you?

691
00:51:14.733 --> 00:51:16.861
Dad, you should try.
Come on.


692
00:51:17.027 --> 00:51:18.904
Let's get out of here.

693
00:51:26.953 --> 00:51:28.754
- Dad, please.
- You do it. Let him put you...


694
00:51:28.789 --> 00:51:30.291
- In the tank?
- Come on, come on, come on.


695
00:51:30.457 --> 00:51:31.800
- Oh, really?
- Come on, come on.


696
00:51:31.958 --> 00:51:33.958
- So do you see him anywhere?
- Who?


697
00:51:34.044 --> 00:51:36.172
Oh, don't even.
You know who. Noah.


698
00:51:36.338 --> 00:51:39.308
No, but he said he was coming,
so I'm not worried.


699
00:51:48.308 --> 00:51:49.981
So what do you guys think?

700
00:51:50.143 --> 00:51:52.316
Well, it's not totally lame.

701
00:51:52.479 --> 00:51:54.902
Yeah.

702
00:51:55.065 --> 00:51:58.660
Um, are there some cool games
or something?


703
00:51:58.819 --> 00:52:01.413
Yes, sure. Come on.

704
00:52:03.073 --> 00:52:04.746
All right,
let's see what you got.


705
00:52:04.908 --> 00:52:06.988
Nice. That was not even close.

706
00:52:07.035 --> 00:52:09.083
All right, all right,
all right, all right.


707
00:52:10.914 --> 00:52:12.962
Nice.

708
00:52:13.959 --> 00:52:15.711
Oh, you guys
really suck at this.


709
00:52:15.877 --> 00:52:18.050
Shut up, Noah.
You're taking all the fun out of it.


710
00:52:18.213 --> 00:52:19.260
I'm just saying.

711
00:52:19.422 --> 00:52:21.424
And aren't you the one that's
supposed to be winning us a prize?


712
00:52:21.591 --> 00:52:24.561
- Maybe he just can't throw a ball.
- Well, that's true.


713
00:52:26.805 --> 00:52:29.934
- Let me show you something.
- Oh, excuse me.


714
00:52:31.601 --> 00:52:33.274
- Oh.
- Holy shit.


715
00:52:33.436 --> 00:52:36.064
Maybe... maybe he can.
I don't know.


716
00:52:36.231 --> 00:52:37.778
Let's just take a seat.

717
00:52:37.941 --> 00:52:39.693
- I'm good. Thank you though.
- No? No?


718
00:52:39.860 --> 00:52:42.033
- I'm also good.
- Thanks.


719
00:52:42.195 --> 00:52:44.539
Cute.

720
00:52:57.752 --> 00:52:59.299
Let's see what you got, Mary.

721
00:52:59.462 --> 00:53:00.839
Oh, I'm not...
I can't follow that.


722
00:53:01.006 --> 00:53:03.134
I'm kind of thirsty. You guys want
to grab something to drink?


723
00:53:03.300 --> 00:53:05.678
Oh, that sounds good. I want one
of those pies I keep seeing around.


724
00:53:05.844 --> 00:53:07.938
- Of course you do.
- Shut up.


725
00:53:14.477 --> 00:53:16.730
Do you see them?
They look so happy.


726
00:53:16.897 --> 00:53:19.696
- They just fit right in here.
- I know. It's kind of perfect.


727
00:53:23.528 --> 00:53:24.905
Thank you.

728
00:53:25.071 --> 00:53:27.620
- So what can I get for you kids?
- Do you have pie here?


729
00:53:27.782 --> 00:53:28.982
- We sure do.
- Can I have one?


730
00:53:29.075 --> 00:53:30.577
What about you?
What would you like?


731
00:53:30.744 --> 00:53:32.371
You? Anything to drink?

732
00:53:36.082 --> 00:53:38.084
We'll have three
lemonades, please.


733
00:53:39.878 --> 00:53:41.755
All right, well,
I guess I'm having lemonade.


734
00:53:44.174 --> 00:53:46.051
Hey, are you okay?

735
00:53:46.218 --> 00:53:47.936
What? Yeah.

736
00:54:01.816 --> 00:54:02.908
Here you go.

737
00:54:03.068 --> 00:54:05.070
Thank you.

738
00:54:06.821 --> 00:54:08.869
- You guys want to go?
- Yeah.


739
00:54:23.380 --> 00:54:25.883
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

740
00:54:26.049 --> 00:54:28.427
Are you okay?
What happened?


741
00:54:28.593 --> 00:54:29.845
No, I'm fine.

742
00:54:30.011 --> 00:54:32.059
I'm good. I thought I was feeling
better, but I guess I'm not.


743
00:54:32.222 --> 00:54:33.599
- Thank you.
- You don't look good.


744
00:54:33.765 --> 00:54:35.312
No, no, I'm good.
I feel better. I threw up.


745
00:54:35.475 --> 00:54:37.978
- I'm gonna take you home.
- No, no, you guys are having...


746
00:54:38.144 --> 00:54:41.694
No, Becca, you guys are
having a good time.


747
00:54:41.856 --> 00:54:43.483
I feel fine.
Seriously, I'm gonna go...


748
00:54:43.650 --> 00:54:44.697
I'm gonna take you home.

749
00:54:44.859 --> 00:54:46.577
Becca, I'm gonna go
find Mom and Dad.


750
00:54:46.736 --> 00:54:48.989
- I'm good. I just want to...
- Are you sure?


751
00:54:49.155 --> 00:54:51.328
Yeah, I'm good.
You guys have fun.


752
00:56:39.891 --> 00:56:43.646
What? Why the fuck
are you doing this?


753
00:56:47.399 --> 00:56:49.777
I... I don't know
what you want,


754
00:56:49.943 --> 00:56:52.913
but please just...
just let me go. It's fine.


755
00:57:13.341 --> 00:57:15.719
What?

756
00:57:16.928 --> 00:57:18.976
What is this?
What are you doing?


757
00:57:20.557 --> 00:57:23.185
Shit. Oh, God.

758
00:57:26.396 --> 00:57:28.516
What is that? What the...
what the fuck are you doing?


759
00:57:31.568 --> 00:57:33.741
Please. Help!

760
00:57:33.903 --> 00:57:36.452
Please, God.

761
00:57:36.614 --> 00:57:38.412
Please help me.

762
00:57:54.048 --> 00:57:55.971
What are you doing?

763
00:57:57.719 --> 00:58:00.188
What the hell is this?

764
00:58:03.516 --> 00:58:05.268
Help!

765
00:58:05.435 --> 00:58:07.437
Please, God, help me!

766
00:58:14.611 --> 00:58:16.454
Please. Oh, God.

767
00:58:16.613 --> 00:58:18.957
Oh, God.

768
00:58:22.410 --> 00:58:24.629
Oh, God. Oh, God.

769
00:58:31.586 --> 00:58:34.806
Oh, my God.

770
00:58:47.644 --> 00:58:49.988
Please help.

771
00:58:50.146 --> 00:58:53.195
I don't know what this is,
but can you... can you...


772
00:58:53.358 --> 00:58:55.406
can you please just untie me?

773
00:58:56.778 --> 00:58:59.497
I didn't do anything.

774
00:59:01.157 --> 00:59:03.330
Oh, please.

775
00:59:03.493 --> 00:59:06.292
Please, I didn't do anything.

776
00:59:09.165 --> 00:59:11.088
Oh, please.

777
00:59:29.018 --> 00:59:31.521
With my blood,
the gate is open.


778
00:59:36.025 --> 00:59:37.993
This is Your servant, Lord.

779
00:59:38.152 --> 00:59:40.905
We commend her immortal soul
to Your everlasting care.


780
00:59:41.072 --> 00:59:42.665
What's happening?

781
00:59:42.824 --> 00:59:45.873
Her body may become
the vessel for His work.


782
00:59:46.035 --> 00:59:48.629
- In her death, may we have life.
- Please. Please.


783
00:59:48.788 --> 00:59:51.041
- In her suffering...
- Help!


784
00:59:51.207 --> 00:59:52.880
...may we have peace.

785
00:59:53.042 --> 00:59:55.511
Somebody please hear me!

786
00:59:55.670 --> 00:59:58.264
Amen.

787
00:59:58.423 --> 01:00:01.176
Come forth
and claim your offering.


788
01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:09.984
No. No.

789
01:00:10.143 --> 01:00:13.738
No. No. No!

790
01:00:55.938 --> 01:00:58.532
- Shh.
- Shush.


791
01:01:00.193 --> 01:01:02.992
Get your sweater.

792
01:01:07.325 --> 01:01:09.202
Let's go, honey.

793
01:01:09.369 --> 01:01:12.088
Let's go.
Come on, let's go.


794
01:01:12.246 --> 01:01:15.466
Jimmy, Jimmy, shh, shh, shh.

795
01:01:17.085 --> 01:01:19.133
Come on, let's go.
Come on, now.


796
01:01:19.295 --> 01:01:21.172
No, now.

797
01:01:21.339 --> 01:01:23.307
- Hey, everybody, come on.
- Shh.


798
01:01:23.466 --> 01:01:24.968
Dan.

799
01:01:27.887 --> 01:01:29.764
Dan, Wendy.

800
01:01:29.931 --> 01:01:31.808
Honey.

801
01:01:31.974 --> 01:01:34.147
- Mary, what's wrong?
- What happened?


802
01:01:34.310 --> 01:01:35.732
What happened to you?

803
01:01:35.895 --> 01:01:37.488
- She was sitting by herself.
- What?


804
01:01:37.647 --> 01:01:39.820
Sweetie, go get your sister.
We gotta go.


805
01:01:39.982 --> 01:01:41.662
- Dan, we need to go.
- Becky!


806
01:01:41.734 --> 01:01:43.134
- Tell her...
- She'll be all right.


807
01:01:43.277 --> 01:01:44.995
Just get her home.
Get her to bed.


808
01:01:45.154 --> 01:01:46.656
- Honey.
- Honey, are you all right?


809
01:01:46.823 --> 01:01:49.167
Are you okay?

810
01:01:51.661 --> 01:01:53.914
I have to tell you something.

811
01:01:55.998 --> 01:01:57.841
What?

812
01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.844
- Becca. Becky.
- What?


813
01:02:01.003 --> 01:02:04.177
I think Mary's sick.
Mom wants you.


814
01:02:04.340 --> 01:02:06.183
What happened?

815
01:02:06.342 --> 01:02:08.515
I don't know.
She doesn't look good though.


816
01:02:08.678 --> 01:02:10.430
Come on, let's go.

817
01:02:10.596 --> 01:02:12.598
I understand. Go ahead.

818
01:02:15.727 --> 01:02:17.445
- Come on, you guys.
- What happened?


819
01:02:17.603 --> 01:02:19.071
- What happened?
- Honey.


820
01:02:19.230 --> 01:02:20.948
She was supposed
to be with you.


821
01:02:21.107 --> 01:02:22.627
She's not feeling well. It's fine.

822
01:02:22.692 --> 01:02:24.865
She'll be all right.
She's just not feeling very well.


823
01:02:27.029 --> 01:02:29.623
All right, sweetie.
Let's just get her upstairs.


824
01:02:29.782 --> 01:02:31.830
Watch your brother.

825
01:02:31.993 --> 01:02:34.337
Hey, let's watch TV.

826
01:02:41.836 --> 01:02:43.463
Hello.

827
01:02:43.629 --> 01:02:45.506
Dad, it's for you.

828
01:02:45.673 --> 01:02:47.550
Um, okay.

829
01:02:47.717 --> 01:02:50.687
Come on, sweets.
Almost there.


830
01:02:56.100 --> 01:02:58.728
Hello. Oh.

831
01:03:14.494 --> 01:03:17.293
Is there any way
we could do it tomorrow?


832
01:03:19.916 --> 01:03:21.793
Okay. Understood.

833
01:03:21.959 --> 01:03:23.461
<i>Okay</i>

834
01:03:24.837 --> 01:03:26.714
Who was that?

835
01:03:26.881 --> 01:03:29.134
I have to go to the church.

836
01:03:29.300 --> 01:03:31.519
What, now? What for?

837
01:03:31.677 --> 01:03:33.850
I don't know.

838
01:03:34.013 --> 01:03:36.391
Kingsman said
that he needed me.


839
01:03:37.517 --> 01:03:39.394
At this hour?
You can't go now.


840
01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:41.437
He knows your daughter's sick.

841
01:03:41.604 --> 01:03:43.447
Yeah, he said
that it was important.


842
01:03:43.606 --> 01:03:45.449
- Honey, I don't...
- How is she?


843
01:03:45.608 --> 01:03:47.110
She's not well.
She's sweating a lot.


844
01:03:47.276 --> 01:03:49.236
She doesn't have a fever.
I don't know what it is.


845
01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:51.618
Okay.
It shouldn't be long, all right?


846
01:04:31.654 --> 01:04:33.656
Hello?

847
01:04:34.824 --> 01:04:36.701
Hello?

848
01:04:36.868 --> 01:04:39.041
Pastor Kingsman?

849
01:05:01.559 --> 01:05:03.436
Ahem.

850
01:05:03.603 --> 01:05:05.605
Pastor Kingsman.

851
01:05:07.356 --> 01:05:08.699
Are you okay?

852
01:05:08.858 --> 01:05:11.281
I had to get you away
from there.


853
01:05:11.444 --> 01:05:14.539
It needs time.

854
01:05:14.697 --> 01:05:16.825
Not much, but it needs time.

855
01:05:19.785 --> 01:05:22.379
I'm afraid
that I'm not following.


856
01:05:22.538 --> 01:05:24.256
I don't know what needs time

857
01:05:24.415 --> 01:05:26.042
and what I'm supposed
to get away from.


858
01:05:26.208 --> 01:05:28.506
Yes, Dan, you are.
You are following.


859
01:05:28.669 --> 01:05:32.845
You are following His will.

860
01:05:37.303 --> 01:05:40.147
You are a good man, Dan.
You are such a good man.


861
01:05:40.306 --> 01:05:42.183
And I am so sorry.

862
01:05:42.350 --> 01:05:45.604
I'm so sorry
that this has to happen


863
01:05:45.770 --> 01:05:48.239
to your family, to you.

864
01:05:48.397 --> 01:05:52.243
Oh, your poor daughter.
She is so young.


865
01:05:52.401 --> 01:05:54.529
What... what are you
talking about?


866
01:05:54.695 --> 01:05:57.995
God give us strength
to do what must be done.


867
01:06:00.534 --> 01:06:03.834
Have faith.
This is His will.


868
01:06:07.041 --> 01:06:10.420
Have faith.
Have faith, Dan.


869
01:06:52.753 --> 01:06:54.551
Mom, I'm gonna go
check on Mary.


870
01:06:54.714 --> 01:06:56.716
Yeah, good. Good.
Thank you.


871
01:07:06.142 --> 01:07:08.144
Mary.

872
01:07:09.812 --> 01:07:11.655
Mare.

873
01:07:12.648 --> 01:07:15.902
Mary. Mare.

874
01:07:17.570 --> 01:07:19.868
Mary! Mary!

875
01:07:20.031 --> 01:07:23.285
Mary. Mary.
Are you okay? Mary.


876
01:07:26.662 --> 01:07:29.165
Mom! Mom.

877
01:07:34.045 --> 01:07:36.343
- Mom.
- What happened?


878
01:07:36.505 --> 01:07:38.382
- I don't know.
- Mary, honey.


879
01:07:38.549 --> 01:07:40.551
Mary. Oh, my God.
You've got to help me.


880
01:07:40.718 --> 01:07:42.595
Christopher!
Sweetie, sweetie, get up.


881
01:07:42.762 --> 01:07:45.356
Christopher! Get up,
Mary, sweetie.


882
01:07:45.514 --> 01:07:47.983
Christopher, call 911!

883
01:07:48.142 --> 01:07:49.689
- It's okay.
- Go!


884
01:07:49.852 --> 01:07:52.196
It's okay.
Christopher, go!


885
01:07:53.898 --> 01:07:55.946
Come on, sweetie.

886
01:07:56.108 --> 01:07:58.531
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.


887
01:07:58.694 --> 01:07:59.991
Whoa.

888
01:08:06.118 --> 01:08:08.462
Oh, my God. Mom.

889
01:08:08.621 --> 01:08:10.965
- Whoa.
- Mom, Mom.


890
01:08:11.123 --> 01:08:13.876
- Honey.
- Mom, what's happening?


891
01:08:14.043 --> 01:08:15.886
I don't know, baby.
I don't know. I don't know.


892
01:08:16.045 --> 01:08:18.047
Christopher!

893
01:08:19.381 --> 01:08:21.554
Sweetheart.

894
01:08:25.346 --> 01:08:27.066
- Oh, my God.
- Get her to the bed.


895
01:08:27.098 --> 01:08:28.771
- Okay.
- Help me. Help me.


896
01:08:28.933 --> 01:08:31.027
Oh, Mary.

897
01:08:31.185 --> 01:08:33.984
Come on, baby.

898
01:08:36.315 --> 01:08:37.783
Christopher!

899
01:08:45.991 --> 01:08:47.993
Sweetie.

900
01:08:51.539 --> 01:08:52.961
- Morn.
- What?


901
01:08:53.124 --> 01:08:55.627
- The phones are all dead.
- What? What are you talking about?


902
01:08:55.793 --> 01:08:58.046
Mom.

903
01:08:58.212 --> 01:09:01.591
I need you to go to the church
and get your father. Go get your father.


904
01:09:01.757 --> 01:09:03.259
- I want to go too.
- Okay, take your brother.


905
01:09:03.425 --> 01:09:06.099
- Okay, let's go.
- Go. Go. Hurry. Hurry.


906
01:09:07.721 --> 01:09:11.271
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.


907
01:09:14.145 --> 01:09:15.613
Becca, wait up.

908
01:09:15.771 --> 01:09:17.614
Come on.

909
01:09:17.773 --> 01:09:20.117
Becca.

910
01:09:22.653 --> 01:09:24.496
We've got to go.

911
01:09:24.655 --> 01:09:26.032
Come on, we need to get Dad.

912
01:09:26.198 --> 01:09:28.166
I can't run as fast as you.
Just don't leave me.


913
01:09:28.325 --> 01:09:31.169
I would never leave you, okay?
We just... we gotta get Dad.


914
01:09:33.789 --> 01:09:35.257
What is that?

915
01:09:35.416 --> 01:09:38.260
I don't know.
Come on, we gotta go.


916
01:09:41.630 --> 01:09:43.632
Come on.

917
01:10:05.321 --> 01:10:07.323
Over here.

918
01:10:17.833 --> 01:10:19.551
Dad!

919
01:10:19.710 --> 01:10:21.132
Dad!

920
01:10:21.295 --> 01:10:23.013
Open! Dad!

921
01:10:23.172 --> 01:10:25.174
Dad, are you in there?

922
01:10:31.931 --> 01:10:34.184
What are you doing here?

923
01:10:35.434 --> 01:10:37.436
Move.

924
01:10:42.858 --> 01:10:44.701
Dad?

925
01:10:44.860 --> 01:10:46.862
Wait here.

926
01:10:52.576 --> 01:10:54.704
Dad!

927
01:10:54.870 --> 01:10:56.998
Oh, my God, Dad.

928
01:10:57.164 --> 01:10:59.383
Dad, are you okay?

929
01:10:59.541 --> 01:11:01.714
- Yeah.
- Dad.


930
01:11:01.877 --> 01:11:04.005
Noah.

931
01:11:05.005 --> 01:11:06.882
- Kingsman.
- Are you okay?


932
01:11:07.049 --> 01:11:09.051
What?

933
01:11:10.719 --> 01:11:13.222
- It was Kingsman.
- What?


934
01:11:14.431 --> 01:11:16.399
Where's your mother?

935
01:11:16.558 --> 01:11:19.437
She's... she's at home.
Mary's...


936
01:11:19.603 --> 01:11:23.153
We have to go.
We have to go now.


937
01:11:23.315 --> 01:11:25.738
- Are you okay, Dad?
- Yeah. Yeah.


938
01:11:31.824 --> 01:11:33.918
Look. What are those?

939
01:11:34.076 --> 01:11:35.794
They're on every house.

940
01:11:35.953 --> 01:11:38.422
Jesus. What...?

941
01:11:44.128 --> 01:11:46.130
We need to get home.

942
01:11:52.428 --> 01:11:54.476
Mary?

943
01:11:56.557 --> 01:11:57.774
Honey?

944
01:11:59.435 --> 01:12:02.029
Mary. Mary?

945
01:12:04.982 --> 01:12:06.029
Mary?

946
01:12:06.191 --> 01:12:07.693
Sweetie?

947
01:12:11.572 --> 01:12:13.370
Oh, my God.

948
01:12:15.451 --> 01:12:18.295
<i>Oh, my... Maw -</i>

949
01:12:35.804 --> 01:12:37.977
Get away.

950
01:13:08.337 --> 01:13:09.714
Dan.

951
01:13:09.880 --> 01:13:14.010
Dan. Dan.

952
01:13:14.176 --> 01:13:16.178
Dan!

953
01:13:39.576 --> 01:13:42.204
Wait here.

954
01:13:46.708 --> 01:13:47.925
- Wait.
- What?


955
01:13:48.085 --> 01:13:50.366
- You can't go there. It's too late.
- What are you doing?


956
01:13:50.379 --> 01:13:52.677
Dad. Dad. Dad.

957
01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:54.433
You can't go in there, Rebecca.
Please trust me.


958
01:13:54.591 --> 01:13:56.218
- What are you doing, Noah?
- You're here for a reason.


959
01:13:56.385 --> 01:13:57.762
- Get off me!
- You have to go now.


960
01:13:57.928 --> 01:14:00.977
- God damn it. Noah.
- It's too late. You can't save them.


961
01:14:01.140 --> 01:14:02.733
Let me go, Noah.

962
01:14:02.891 --> 01:14:04.393
It's too late.
You can't save them.


963
01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:06.688
- Please get in the car.
- Dad!


964
01:14:07.855 --> 01:14:10.199
Rebecca, please get in the car.

965
01:14:29.668 --> 01:14:31.670
Hello?

966
01:14:52.274 --> 01:14:54.276
Wendy.

967
01:15:01.366 --> 01:15:02.743
Wendy.

968
01:15:03.744 --> 01:15:05.746
Honey.

969
01:15:06.788 --> 01:15:08.790
Honey.

970
01:15:22.679 --> 01:15:24.681
Wendy.

971
01:15:26.350 --> 01:15:28.694
Wendy.

972
01:15:44.701 --> 01:15:46.703
Mary?

973
01:15:58.882 --> 01:16:01.101
Honey?

974
01:16:01.260 --> 01:16:03.934
Mary-

975
01:16:22.614 --> 01:16:24.912
- Start the car! Go!
- Dad.


976
01:16:25.075 --> 01:16:26.952
- Dad.
- Start the car!


977
01:16:27.119 --> 01:16:29.622
- Dad, what's going on?
- Is that Mary?


978
01:16:34.668 --> 01:16:36.420
- Go! Get in the car!
- What?


979
01:16:36.587 --> 01:16:38.305
- Dad.
- Get them out of here. Get help.


980
01:16:38.463 --> 01:16:39.715
Get help. Go, go, go!

981
01:16:39.881 --> 01:16:41.804
- Get in the car!
- Daddy, you have to come.


982
01:16:41.967 --> 01:16:43.560
- Dan, get in the car.
- No. No.


983
01:16:43.719 --> 01:16:45.813
Dad!

984
01:16:45.971 --> 01:16:47.973
Daddy!

985
01:16:48.140 --> 01:16:49.900
What are you doing?
We can't leave him there.


986
01:16:49.933 --> 01:16:52.231
We have to go. You have no idea
what that thing can do.


987
01:16:52.394 --> 01:16:53.896
Dad!

988
01:16:55.355 --> 01:16:59.076
Whatever this is,
please let it leave my daughter.


989
01:17:02.112 --> 01:17:04.911
In the name of Jesus Christ
our Holy Savior,


990
01:17:05.073 --> 01:17:07.167
please be rid of my daughter.

991
01:17:09.369 --> 01:17:10.621
Leave my daughter!

992
01:17:19.630 --> 01:17:21.632
Mary?

993
01:17:24.134 --> 01:17:25.761
Mary?

994
01:17:25.927 --> 01:17:28.225
Honey?

995
01:17:34.561 --> 01:17:35.733
Dad!

996
01:18:08.136 --> 01:18:11.310
Mary, no!

997
01:18:31.368 --> 01:18:33.587
Stop the car.

998
01:18:33.745 --> 01:18:35.793
We can't.

999
01:18:35.956 --> 01:18:38.209
Stop the car now.

1000
01:18:38.375 --> 01:18:39.752
That's not your sister.

1001
01:18:39.918 --> 01:18:42.592
Stop the fucking car now.

1002
01:18:42.754 --> 01:18:45.382
Why are you stopping?

1003
01:18:45.549 --> 01:18:48.177
Don't stop.
Keep going.


1004
01:18:51.972 --> 01:18:53.690
Rebecca.

1005
01:18:53.849 --> 01:18:55.851
Listen to me.
She's not your sister anymore.


1006
01:18:56.017 --> 01:18:57.519
What the hell does that mean?

1007
01:18:57.686 --> 01:18:59.366
What does that mean, Noah?
What's going on?


1008
01:18:59.438 --> 01:19:01.611
Get in the car.

1009
01:19:07.154 --> 01:19:09.498
Get in the car.

1010
01:19:09.656 --> 01:19:11.408
Please get back in the car.

1011
01:19:11.575 --> 01:19:14.249
I'll tell you what I know, but you
have to get back in the car right now.


1012
01:19:14.411 --> 01:19:16.288
What?
You're part of this?


1013
01:19:16.455 --> 01:19:18.332
Oh, my God,
you're part of this?


1014
01:19:18.498 --> 01:19:21.092
Rebecca, please
get in the fucking car!


1015
01:19:21.251 --> 01:19:23.253
You were chosen.

1016
01:19:23.420 --> 01:19:25.013
Chosen?

1017
01:19:25.172 --> 01:19:27.266
Yes. You, your whole family.

1018
01:19:27.424 --> 01:19:28.801
You were chosen.
We all were.


1019
01:19:28.967 --> 01:19:31.061
I don't understand.

1020
01:19:31.219 --> 01:19:32.562
We aren't meant to.

1021
01:19:32.721 --> 01:19:35.144
My whole family was brought here
just like yours.


1022
01:19:35.307 --> 01:19:37.935
You come here and you think
it's fucking perfect,


1023
01:19:38.101 --> 01:19:39.981
and then you're fucked...
you, your whole family.


1024
01:19:40.020 --> 01:19:41.021
That's just what happens.

1025
01:19:41.188 --> 01:19:42.781
If they even knew I was
telling you any of this...


1026
01:19:42.939 --> 01:19:44.816
Who is they?
Pastor Kingsman?


1027
01:19:44.983 --> 01:19:46.109
Kingsman is just the keeper.

1028
01:19:46.276 --> 01:19:47.877
He is just doing
what he was asked to do.


1029
01:19:47.986 --> 01:19:51.866
This place is a doorway,
and on the other side is evil.


1030
01:19:52.032 --> 01:19:53.750
We were picked to be a part
of this great, big plan


1031
01:19:53.909 --> 01:19:55.069
that we have no control over.

1032
01:19:55.160 --> 01:19:56.880
All I know is that once
the doorway is open,


1033
01:19:56.995 --> 01:19:59.498
we have one job,
and one job only... to shut it.


1034
01:20:01.291 --> 01:20:03.339
I'm sorry.
I'm trying to save you.


1035
01:20:03.502 --> 01:20:05.550
Please trust me.
You have to get back in the car


1036
01:20:05.712 --> 01:20:07.840
and we have to go right now.

1037
01:20:12.636 --> 01:20:14.638
Get in the car!

1038
01:20:22.813 --> 01:20:24.815
- Christopher!
- Help!


1039
01:20:25.941 --> 01:20:28.535
Help! Help!

1040
01:20:28.693 --> 01:20:30.536
- Christopher, she's coming.
- Help!


1041
01:20:30.695 --> 01:20:32.823
She's coming, Christopher!
What are you doing?


1042
01:20:32.989 --> 01:20:34.741
Christopher!

1043
01:20:35.742 --> 01:20:37.961
No! She's coming,
Christopher!


1044
01:20:50.715 --> 01:20:53.810
Help! Help!
Let me in!


1045
01:20:53.969 --> 01:20:56.313
Help! Help!

1046
01:20:56.471 --> 01:20:58.565
Please.

1047
01:20:58.723 --> 01:21:00.600
Help!

1048
01:21:00.767 --> 01:21:02.769
Please let me in!

1049
01:21:07.816 --> 01:21:09.818
Help!

1050
01:21:16.658 --> 01:21:19.332
Help! Help, please!

1051
01:21:19.494 --> 01:21:21.212
Please help!

1052
01:22:09.085 --> 01:22:11.463
What are we gonna do?

1053
01:22:12.797 --> 01:22:14.799
Just keep looking.

1054
01:22:23.725 --> 01:22:25.318
Oh, God.

1055
01:22:27.103 --> 01:22:29.105
There she... there she is!

1056
01:22:33.234 --> 01:22:34.736
Christopher is inside.

1057
01:22:34.903 --> 01:22:36.951
Oh, my God.

1058
01:22:37.113 --> 01:22:39.787
Is he gonna be safe in there?

1059
01:22:39.950 --> 01:22:43.250
I'm sorry,
but you can't stay here.


1060
01:22:43.411 --> 01:22:45.413
Please.

1061
01:22:48.750 --> 01:22:50.627
Why?

1062
01:22:50.794 --> 01:22:52.467
Why won't you help me?

1063
01:22:59.344 --> 01:23:01.187
Why won't you help me?

1064
01:23:04.057 --> 01:23:06.276
I'm sorry,
but you have to leave.


1065
01:23:06.434 --> 01:23:08.903
- Please. No. No!
- I'm sorry, but you have to leave.


1066
01:23:09.062 --> 01:23:12.487
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Please. Please.


1067
01:23:12.649 --> 01:23:15.118
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Please no!


1068
01:23:15.276 --> 01:23:17.495
No. Please.

1069
01:23:17.654 --> 01:23:20.203
Please, no, don't do this!

1070
01:23:20.365 --> 01:23:22.618
- I'm sorry.
- You can't put me out there!


1071
01:24:03.658 --> 01:24:05.501
Christopher.

1072
01:24:05.660 --> 01:24:07.879
Chris, I'm sorry.
Come on.


1073
01:24:08.038 --> 01:24:10.507
Come on, get in the car.

1074
01:24:20.175 --> 01:24:22.098
Come on, come on.

1075
01:24:22.260 --> 01:24:24.103
Hurry. Okay.

1076
01:24:24.262 --> 01:24:26.310
Go. She's coming! Go!

1077
01:24:45.533 --> 01:24:47.786
It's okay. It's okay.
We're gonna be okay.


1078
01:24:47.952 --> 01:24:50.250
You're safe now.
You're safe.


1079
01:24:51.289 --> 01:24:53.508
Where the hell are you going?

1080
01:24:53.666 --> 01:24:55.543
We have to stop the bleeding.

1081
01:24:55.710 --> 01:24:58.839
Oh, God.
It's okay, Chris. It's okay.


1082
01:24:59.005 --> 01:25:00.882
It's okay.

1083
01:25:04.552 --> 01:25:06.646
- Leave the car running.
- What?


1084
01:25:06.805 --> 01:25:08.565
If it comes, you have to
promise me to leave.


1085
01:25:08.723 --> 01:25:10.691
- Rebecca.
- But, Noah...


1086
01:25:10.850 --> 01:25:13.649
- Rebecca.
- Please promise.


1087
01:25:13.812 --> 01:25:15.985
Noah, I promise.
Please just don't leave me.


1088
01:25:24.489 --> 01:25:27.208
It's okay.
You're gonna be all right.


1089
01:25:30.829 --> 01:25:32.581
It's okay.

1090
01:25:33.581 --> 01:25:35.959
Okay. It's okay.

1091
01:25:48.513 --> 01:25:49.685
It's okay.

1092
01:25:50.890 --> 01:25:53.689
It's okay.

1093
01:26:14.998 --> 01:26:17.000
- Shit.
- What's happening?


1094
01:26:19.460 --> 01:26:22.464
No, no.

1095
01:26:24.716 --> 01:26:26.093
No. No.

1096
01:26:26.259 --> 01:26:28.637
Christopher! No.

1097
01:26:29.721 --> 01:26:31.723
No! No.
Christopher, get away!


1098
01:26:31.890 --> 01:26:34.734
- Rebecca! Rebecca!
- Christopher!


1099
01:26:34.893 --> 01:26:37.066
- No, Noah! No!
- Come on!


1100
01:26:37.228 --> 01:26:39.606
Christopher! Christopher!

1101
01:26:39.772 --> 01:26:42.321
- Christopher!
- No!


1102
01:26:42.483 --> 01:26:44.076
No! Becca!

1103
01:26:48.364 --> 01:26:51.083
No!

1104
01:26:51.242 --> 01:26:54.121
No!
Christopher!


1105
01:26:55.663 --> 01:26:58.382
No! Christopher!

1106
01:26:58.541 --> 01:27:00.589
Stop it!
Get off of him!


1107
01:27:10.845 --> 01:27:12.688
Christopher!

1108
01:27:23.024 --> 01:27:25.368
No!

1109
01:27:31.074 --> 01:27:33.372
Christopher!

1110
01:27:36.704 --> 01:27:38.377
No.

1111
01:28:35.388 --> 01:28:37.857
I have to keep you safe.

1112
01:28:38.016 --> 01:28:40.314
I know a place. It's safe.
We can hide there till morning.


1113
01:28:40.476 --> 01:28:42.774
Where?

1114
01:28:48.735 --> 01:28:50.737
In here.

1115
01:29:16.804 --> 01:29:19.478
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.


1116
01:29:20.933 --> 01:29:24.608
- Why are you doing this?
- I'm sorry.


1117
01:29:24.771 --> 01:29:27.741
He's doing what God
has asked us to do.


1118
01:29:27.899 --> 01:29:30.698
We must close the gate
and end this,


1119
01:29:30.860 --> 01:29:33.989
or else darkness
will subdue the light


1120
01:29:34.155 --> 01:29:36.578
and the world will become his.

1121
01:29:39.243 --> 01:29:41.120
It's the way it's always been.

1122
01:29:41.287 --> 01:29:43.460
There is no other way.

1123
01:29:43.623 --> 01:29:46.877
We must close the gate.
