00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.555
( camera rolling )

2
00:00:21.181 --> 00:00:23.139
( music playing )

3
00:00:32.222 --> 00:00:36.555
Steven Spielberg:
I started making movies
when I was a young kid,


4
00:00:36.555 --> 00:00:41.222
but I remember the time
I almost gave up my dream
of being a movie director.


5
00:00:41.222 --> 00:00:43.597
I must have been 16.

6
00:00:43.597 --> 00:00:45.555
( music playing )

7
00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:53.639
Spielberg:
A movie came into town
called "Lawrence of Arabia,"


8
00:00:53.639 --> 00:00:56.056
and everybody
was talking about it.


9
00:00:56.056 --> 00:00:58.847
I never sat in a fancy
theater seat before.


10
00:00:58.847 --> 00:01:02.222
Premium ticket price,

11
00:01:02.222 --> 00:01:03.555
stereophonic sound.

12
00:01:05.972 --> 00:01:07.388
And when
the film was over,


13
00:01:07.388 --> 00:01:10.139
I wanted to not be
a director anymore


14
00:01:10.139 --> 00:01:12.430
because the bar
was too high.


15
00:01:15.263 --> 00:01:19.139
There was a scene
where he looked at himself
in that sword/knife,


16
00:01:19.139 --> 00:01:21.430
when he was first
given the robes


17
00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:22.889
and he thought
he was alone.


18
00:01:22.889 --> 00:01:24.597
And he walked
around laughing


19
00:01:24.597 --> 00:01:27.639
and looking at his shadow
where the diaphanous robe


20
00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:29.263
he was holding out
was actually imprinted


21
00:01:29.263 --> 00:01:31.139
- on the sand in shadow.
- ( laughs )


22
00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:32.931
It was a great moment.

23
00:01:32.931 --> 00:01:36.263
And then later,
when they route
the retreating Turks,


24
00:01:36.263 --> 00:01:38.931
you see him again
covered in gore.


25
00:01:38.931 --> 00:01:42.097
And he's got the knife
in the same position
he had it


26
00:01:42.097 --> 00:01:44.889
in his pristine days,
in his glory days.


27
00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:49.097
And he's looking at himself,
who he's become.


28
00:01:49.097 --> 00:01:51.263
It was the first time,
seeing a movie,


29
00:01:51.263 --> 00:01:54.972
I realized that
there are themes that aren't
narrative story themes.


30
00:01:54.972 --> 00:01:57.847
There are themes
that are character themes,
that are personal themes.


31
00:01:57.847 --> 00:02:00.388
That David Lean
created a portraiture,


32
00:02:00.388 --> 00:02:02.972
surrounded the portrait
with a mural


33
00:02:02.972 --> 00:02:04.889
of scope
and epic action,


34
00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:09.181
but at the heart and core
of "Lawrence of Arabia"


35
00:02:09.181 --> 00:02:11.680
is "Who am I"?

36
00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.972
- ( gunfire )
- ( all yelling )


37
00:02:13.972 --> 00:02:19.889
Spielberg:
I had such a profound reaction
to the filmmaking,


38
00:02:19.889 --> 00:02:23.305
and I went back
and saw the film
a week later.


39
00:02:23.305 --> 00:02:25.555
I saw the film
a week after that.


40
00:02:25.555 --> 00:02:27.513
And I saw the film
a week after that.


41
00:02:27.513 --> 00:02:30.014
And I realized that
there was no going back,


42
00:02:30.014 --> 00:02:32.764
that this was going to be
what I was gonna do


43
00:02:32.764 --> 00:02:35.388
or I was gonna
die trying.


44
00:02:35.388 --> 00:02:38.388
But this was going to be
the rest of my life.


45
00:02:38.388 --> 00:02:40.347
( music playing )

46
00:03:07.056 --> 00:03:09.181
( explosion )

47
00:03:13.847 --> 00:03:15.972
( music continues )

48
00:03:37.222 --> 00:03:40.097
( roaring )

49
00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:43.555
( distant explosions )

50
00:03:51.056 --> 00:03:53.222
( music continues )

51
00:04:36.972 --> 00:04:39.722
And then trying to get--
it felt lined up.


52
00:04:39.722 --> 00:04:42.139
- Man: The camera
just gotta go right.
- Just a little bit lower.


53
00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:44.097
That's good right there.
That's perfect.


54
00:04:44.097 --> 00:04:45.764
Yeah, camera has to go
right a bit, please.


55
00:04:45.764 --> 00:04:47.305
Go right.

56
00:04:47.305 --> 00:04:49.097
- Right, right, right, right.
- Man: Can you get there?


57
00:04:49.097 --> 00:04:50.972
Right there
would be good.


58
00:04:50.972 --> 00:04:53.597
Spielberg:
Every time I start
a new scene, I'm nervous.


59
00:04:53.597 --> 00:04:56.181
And it's like
going to school,
having to take a test.


60
00:04:56.181 --> 00:04:58.388
I never heard the lines
spoken before.


61
00:04:58.388 --> 00:05:00.181
I don't know
what I'm gonna think
of hearing the lines,


62
00:05:00.181 --> 00:05:01.722
I don't know what
I'm gonna tell the actors,


63
00:05:01.722 --> 00:05:03.513
I don't know where
I'm gonna put the camera.


64
00:05:03.513 --> 00:05:06.056
And every single time,
it's the same.


65
00:05:06.056 --> 00:05:07.889
But I tell you,
it's the greatest feeling
in the world.


66
00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:09.305
I'll tell you
why it's a good feeling.


67
00:05:09.305 --> 00:05:11.513
The more
I'm feeling confident


68
00:05:11.513 --> 00:05:13.847
and secure
about something,


69
00:05:13.847 --> 00:05:15.931
the less
I'm gonna put out.


70
00:05:15.931 --> 00:05:19.931
The more I'm feeling,
"Uh-oh, this could be
a major problem


71
00:05:19.931 --> 00:05:21.639
in getting
the story told,"


72
00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:23.555
I'm gonna work overtime
to meet the challenge


73
00:05:23.555 --> 00:05:25.139
and get the job done.

74
00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:27.181
All right, that's done.
I don't know if it's worth it.


75
00:05:27.181 --> 00:05:29.639
Spielberg:
And so, I hate the feeling
of being nervous,


76
00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:31.722
but I need to feel
in this moment


77
00:05:31.722 --> 00:05:34.764
I'm really not sure
what I'm doing.


78
00:05:34.764 --> 00:05:39.847
And when that verges on panic,
I get great ideas.


79
00:05:39.847 --> 00:05:42.805
The more I feel
backed into a corner,


80
00:05:42.805 --> 00:05:44.222
the more rewarding
it becomes


81
00:05:44.222 --> 00:05:45.597
when I figure my way out
of the corner.


82
00:05:45.597 --> 00:05:47.305
I love it.
Next shot.


83
00:05:47.305 --> 00:05:48.680
Good.

84
00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:51.513
- ( music playing )
- ( muffled chatter )


85
00:06:07.972 --> 00:06:10.097
( yelling )

86
00:06:10.097 --> 00:06:12.222
- Did you see that?
- Yes.


87
00:06:12.222 --> 00:06:14.305
( screams )

88
00:06:14.305 --> 00:06:17.222
( muffled screaming )

89
00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:22.347
Martin Scorsese:
I remember when Steven
was in production on "Jaws,"


90
00:06:22.347 --> 00:06:24.764
the word around town
and in the "LA Times"


91
00:06:24.764 --> 00:06:27.680
was that it was folly
and that it was gonna be
a disaster.


92
00:06:30.597 --> 00:06:33.722
Richard Dreyfuss:
"Jaws" started filming
on May 2nd.


93
00:06:33.722 --> 00:06:36.014
I was hired,
I think, on May 3rd,


94
00:06:36.014 --> 00:06:39.639
and they had no shark,
no script, and no cast


95
00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:42.056
when they first started,
so...


96
00:06:42.056 --> 00:06:43.847
The script
was never locked.


97
00:06:43.847 --> 00:06:46.014
We were
rewriting the script


98
00:06:46.014 --> 00:06:49.014
12 hours
before we were shooting
what we just wrote.


99
00:06:49.014 --> 00:06:51.347
You know, it's scary
for a director to not know


100
00:06:51.347 --> 00:06:54.056
if he's gonna be able
to hand pages to his cast
the next morning.


101
00:06:54.056 --> 00:06:55.805
Man:
Guys, we can't shoot
right now.


102
00:06:55.805 --> 00:06:57.388
- Hold on.
- Man #2: Hold on.


103
00:06:57.388 --> 00:06:59.597
Spielberg:
This is my second day
at sea


104
00:06:59.597 --> 00:07:02.805
and I have

105
00:07:02.805 --> 00:07:05.805
And if I survive this,

106
00:07:05.805 --> 00:07:08.931
I'll have learned a lot,
because right now all I can
tell you is


107
00:07:08.931 --> 00:07:12.555
it's twice as slow
shooting at sea as it is
shooting on land.


108
00:07:12.555 --> 00:07:16.513
Bill Butler: Well, the studio
had never shot a film
on the ocean before.


109
00:07:16.513 --> 00:07:18.347
They would do it
on the back lake.


110
00:07:18.347 --> 00:07:21.097
They would do it
in a studio tank.


111
00:07:21.097 --> 00:07:22.639
They would make
miniature boats.


112
00:07:22.639 --> 00:07:24.764
They would--
everything would be so easy


113
00:07:24.764 --> 00:07:27.430
that you would never
get cold or wet.


114
00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:30.472
But Steven said,
"I'm gonna shoot
in the open ocean."


115
00:07:30.472 --> 00:07:32.097
Roll sound.

116
00:07:32.097 --> 00:07:34.263
Spielberg:
This was supposed
to be a thriller


117
00:07:34.263 --> 00:07:36.805
based on people
like you and me that are
out of our element


118
00:07:36.805 --> 00:07:40.472
and having to fight something
we have no comprehension
how to deal with.


119
00:07:40.472 --> 00:07:42.472
That needs a level
of authenticity


120
00:07:42.472 --> 00:07:44.472
that I thought shooting it
in the back lot


121
00:07:44.472 --> 00:07:47.014
at Universal
in North Hollywood
would not give it.


122
00:07:47.014 --> 00:07:49.597
So, to me,
there was no going back.


123
00:07:49.597 --> 00:07:51.513
It had to be shot
in the ocean.


124
00:07:51.513 --> 00:07:53.014
( music playing )

125
00:07:58.931 --> 00:08:01.472
Spielberg:
I thought it was
gonna be a cakewalk,


126
00:08:01.472 --> 00:08:03.931
but I didn't know anything
about tides or currents.


127
00:08:03.931 --> 00:08:06.139
I didn't know
about how the wind
affects the water,


128
00:08:06.139 --> 00:08:08.388
how the color of the sky
changes the color
of the water,


129
00:08:08.388 --> 00:08:10.513
or how you can't get
anything to match.


130
00:08:10.513 --> 00:08:14.388
It was one nightmare,
worst-case scenario
after the other.


131
00:08:14.388 --> 00:08:16.097
I didn't think
we'd ever finish.


132
00:08:16.097 --> 00:08:18.680
I had just assumed
I'd be fired off the picture.


133
00:08:22.014 --> 00:08:25.305
We were isolated
in the middle of the ocean,

134
00:08:25.305 --> 00:08:30.972
and it was technology
over art every single day.


135
00:08:30.972 --> 00:08:33.430
We'd get a shot,
art was there,


136
00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:37.222
but you couldn't recognize
the art from the effort.


137
00:08:37.222 --> 00:08:40.722
Just trying to hold
a whole movie story
in my head


138
00:08:40.722 --> 00:08:43.931
is a very lonely thing,
because nobody can really
help me with that.


139
00:08:43.931 --> 00:08:46.181
I have to see it
before I film it.


140
00:08:46.181 --> 00:08:47.847
And that's why
it was so scary on "Jaws"--


141
00:08:47.847 --> 00:08:50.014
when I couldn't see it
until I finally did.


142
00:08:52.639 --> 00:08:56.056
Just before I went off
to make "Jaws," I got to meet
Henry Hathaway.


143
00:08:56.056 --> 00:08:58.347
He was kind of
a tough-guy director,
and he said,


144
00:08:58.347 --> 00:09:00.972
"There's gonna be moments
where you're gonna
get to the set


145
00:09:00.972 --> 00:09:03.222
and you're not gonna know
what the hell you're doing.


146
00:09:03.222 --> 00:09:04.639
It happens to all of us.

147
00:09:04.639 --> 00:09:07.680
You've gotta
guard that secret
with your life.


148
00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:10.972
Let no one see
when you're unsure
of yourself.


149
00:09:10.972 --> 00:09:12.555
Hide that
from everybody,


150
00:09:12.555 --> 00:09:14.972
or you'll lose
the respect of everyone."


151
00:09:14.972 --> 00:09:16.972
Man:
Marker.


152
00:09:16.972 --> 00:09:18.597
- Man #2: Good blood.
- Spielberg: And... ready?


153
00:09:18.597 --> 00:09:21.222
- And action, Roy.
- Slow ahead.


154
00:09:21.222 --> 00:09:22.889
I can go slow ahead.

155
00:09:22.889 --> 00:09:25.388
You ought to come down
and ladle some of this shit.


156
00:09:30.472 --> 00:09:32.430
Spielberg:
And down.


157
00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:35.513
Absolutely everything
was falling apart.


158
00:09:35.513 --> 00:09:38.056
The first time
we tested the shark,
it sunk.


159
00:09:38.056 --> 00:09:39.889
It would come up
out of the water and go...


160
00:09:39.889 --> 00:09:43.181
( vocalizing )
Like that.


161
00:09:43.181 --> 00:09:45.639
Spielberg:
I knew that it's gonna take


162
00:09:45.639 --> 00:09:47.263
three or four weeks
to rebuild the shark,


163
00:09:47.263 --> 00:09:49.430
and so we'd have to make up
something else


164
00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:51.056
that didn't exactly
show the shark


165
00:09:51.056 --> 00:09:53.263
but gave the sense
the shark was near.


166
00:09:59.513 --> 00:10:00.889
Bring it around
after him!


167
00:10:00.889 --> 00:10:03.597
Spielberg:
The barrels were a godsend,


168
00:10:03.597 --> 00:10:08.597
because I didn't need to show
the shark as long as those
barrels were around.


169
00:10:08.597 --> 00:10:11.430
What you don't see
is generally scarier
than what you do see,


170
00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:14.305
and the script was filled
with "shark."


171
00:10:14.305 --> 00:10:16.805
Shark here, shark there,
shark everywhere.


172
00:10:16.805 --> 00:10:18.931
The movie doesn't have
very much shark in it.


173
00:10:22.805 --> 00:10:24.805
( boat engine starting )

174
00:10:24.805 --> 00:10:27.513
John Williams:
If the shark had been
available visually,


175
00:10:27.513 --> 00:10:30.097
it might have changed
the whole psychology


176
00:10:30.097 --> 00:10:31.805
of the experience.

177
00:10:31.805 --> 00:10:35.097
( music playing )

178
00:10:35.097 --> 00:10:37.513
Williams:
When you hear,
"boom-boom, boom-boom,"


179
00:10:37.513 --> 00:10:40.597
you've already been
conditioned to think that's
when the shark is present.


180
00:10:40.597 --> 00:10:43.139
When the shark is far away,
it's very faint.


181
00:10:43.139 --> 00:10:47.805
When the shark is just about
to attack, it's very close
and it's very loud.


182
00:10:55.056 --> 00:10:57.722
Williams: We can advertise
the shark's presence
or his attitude


183
00:10:57.722 --> 00:11:01.513
by how we manage
these notes,


184
00:11:01.513 --> 00:11:03.347
just very few notes.

185
00:11:06.639 --> 00:11:12.347
Dreyfuss:
You are in a state of anxiety
without seeing a shark.


186
00:11:12.347 --> 00:11:14.513
It just scares the crap
out of you.


187
00:11:15.889 --> 00:11:17.305
Charlie,
take my word for it!


188
00:11:17.305 --> 00:11:19.097
Don't look back!
Swim, Charlie!


189
00:11:19.097 --> 00:11:20.347
Swim!
Come on, Charlie!


190
00:11:20.347 --> 00:11:24.347
Dun-dun.
Dun-dun, dun-dun.


191
00:11:24.347 --> 00:11:28.181
Dun-dun, dun-dun, dun-dun,
bom,  bom, bom, bom, bom, bom.


192
00:11:28.181 --> 00:11:29.972
Come on,
a little more, Charlie.
Attaboy.


193
00:11:29.972 --> 00:11:32.181
Come here, Charlie.
Attaboy. Attaboy.


194
00:11:32.181 --> 00:11:36.722
David Edelstein:
It is a perfect exercise
in suspense


195
00:11:36.722 --> 00:11:40.056
with technique
that any other filmmaker
would kill for.


196
00:11:42.347 --> 00:11:45.680
Spielberg: I knew I was using
an electric cattle prod
on the audience


197
00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:49.639
every time
there was some kind
of a pop-up surprise.


198
00:11:49.639 --> 00:11:52.139
Michael Phillips:
Like Hitchcock, he knows
how to get you


199
00:11:52.139 --> 00:11:53.639
on the edge of your seat.

200
00:11:53.639 --> 00:11:56.805
He doesn't show you
what you want to see,


201
00:11:56.805 --> 00:11:58.889
and then he delivers it
when he wants to deliver it.


202
00:11:58.889 --> 00:12:03.222
- ( screams )
- J. Hoberman: He certainly
likes torturing the audience.


203
00:12:04.388 --> 00:12:06.222
Has he ever been
in analysis?


204
00:12:06.222 --> 00:12:08.056
( thunder rumbling )

205
00:12:08.056 --> 00:12:10.931
1, 1,000; 2, 1,000;

206
00:12:10.931 --> 00:12:13.764
3, 1,000; 4, 1,000...

207
00:12:13.764 --> 00:12:15.805
Spielberg:
Everything scared me
when I was a kid.


208
00:12:15.805 --> 00:12:17.097
Everything.

209
00:12:19.764 --> 00:12:23.263
- 1, 1,000;

210
00:12:23.263 --> 00:12:26.430
Spielberg:
I had a tree out my window
that was terrifying.


211
00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:28.305
It was just terrifying.

212
00:12:28.305 --> 00:12:29.931
1, 1,000; 2, 1,000...

213
00:12:29.931 --> 00:12:32.097
Spielberg:
I was filled
with so much fear


214
00:12:32.097 --> 00:12:34.555
that I needed
to exorcise some of that.


215
00:12:34.555 --> 00:12:38.931
And what better audience
to exorcise myself
of my demons


216
00:12:38.931 --> 00:12:40.263
than my three sisters.

217
00:12:40.263 --> 00:12:43.014
( music playing )

218
00:12:43.014 --> 00:12:46.639
He would lock us
in the closet with a skull,


219
00:12:46.639 --> 00:12:50.597
which he had dripped
different colors of wax
all over.


220
00:12:50.597 --> 00:12:51.764
It almost looked
like blood.


221
00:12:51.764 --> 00:12:53.931
I'd blindfold them
one at a time,


222
00:12:53.931 --> 00:12:55.555
bring them
into the closet.


223
00:12:55.555 --> 00:12:57.972
I'd put my whole body weight
against the door.


224
00:12:57.972 --> 00:12:59.597
They'd take
their blindfold off,


225
00:12:59.597 --> 00:13:04.014
and I would just sit there
listening to them screaming.


226
00:13:04.014 --> 00:13:07.972
I mean, telling
this story now...


227
00:13:07.972 --> 00:13:09.639
I still think
it was pretty cool.


228
00:13:09.639 --> 00:13:11.472
I was gonna say,
"I hate myself for that."


229
00:13:11.472 --> 00:13:13.305
I don't hate
myself for that.
It was fun.


230
00:13:13.305 --> 00:13:15.388
At first,
he just scared us.


231
00:13:15.388 --> 00:13:17.014
But through his movies,

232
00:13:17.014 --> 00:13:20.139
he gets to scare the shit
out of everybody now.


233
00:13:20.139 --> 00:13:21.430
( screams )

234
00:13:24.889 --> 00:13:26.972
- ( screaming )
- Dan Rather:
The blockbuster movie


235
00:13:26.972 --> 00:13:28.972
of the summer,
of course, is "Jaws,"


236
00:13:28.972 --> 00:13:31.597
a tale of a murderous
white shark on the loose.


237
00:13:31.597 --> 00:13:33.639
And that movie's release
was well timed


238
00:13:33.639 --> 00:13:35.972
for maximum impact
during the vacation season,


239
00:13:35.972 --> 00:13:37.805
and some people
who have seen it


240
00:13:37.805 --> 00:13:40.597
are now seeing phantom sharks
every time they go
near the water.


241
00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:45.513
Scorsese:
I remember the night
"Jaws" opened.


242
00:13:45.513 --> 00:13:48.181
I was with Steven.
He said, "Let's go
and see the lines."


243
00:13:48.181 --> 00:13:51.014
And we were looking, going by
all the lines in Westwood


244
00:13:51.014 --> 00:13:53.555
and places like that,
and I said, "This is it.


245
00:13:53.555 --> 00:13:55.972
This is gonna be
a major change."


246
00:13:55.972 --> 00:13:57.680
Janet Maslin:
I was with him in the car


247
00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:01.472
and he was really,
really nervous but excited.


248
00:14:01.472 --> 00:14:03.430
And the car
went around the corner,


249
00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:05.597
and there was the line
went around the corner,


250
00:14:05.597 --> 00:14:08.347
and then the car kept going,
and the line kept going.


251
00:14:08.347 --> 00:14:10.388
And he was
absolutely beside himself.


252
00:14:10.388 --> 00:14:12.680
You know, it was
this instant breakthrough.


253
00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:15.680
It was like
balloons were exploding
inside of this car.


254
00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:19.472
And his whole life changed
in that couple of minutes.


255
00:14:19.472 --> 00:14:21.347
And he was 25 years old
or something.


256
00:14:24.555 --> 00:14:26.597
Spielberg:
"Jaws" went
triple its budget


257
00:14:26.597 --> 00:14:29.347
and it went about
two and a half times
its schedule.


258
00:14:29.347 --> 00:14:32.388
We wound up shooting
the movie in 159 days.


259
00:14:32.388 --> 00:14:35.181
The film was originally
scheduled for 55 days.


260
00:14:35.181 --> 00:14:36.972
But my hubris
was I actually thought


261
00:14:36.972 --> 00:14:39.722
I could shoot the film
in 55 days.


262
00:14:39.722 --> 00:14:44.097
Steven shook the very bones
of Hollywood.


263
00:14:44.097 --> 00:14:45.931
"Jaws" made more money

264
00:14:45.931 --> 00:14:50.305
than any film had ever made
up to that time.


265
00:14:50.305 --> 00:14:52.056
Spielberg:
The success of that
changed my life.


266
00:14:52.056 --> 00:14:53.597
You know,
it gave me final cut.


267
00:14:53.597 --> 00:14:55.222
It gave me a chance
to pick and choose


268
00:14:55.222 --> 00:14:57.722
the movies I directed
from that moment on.


269
00:14:57.722 --> 00:15:01.597
So "Jaws" was a free pass
into my future.


270
00:15:04.014 --> 00:15:07.097
- ( music playing )
- ( applause )


271
00:15:09.597 --> 00:15:12.139
I want you to meet
a filmmaker now who has taken


272
00:15:12.139 --> 00:15:15.430
the movie-going public
and shaken it to
its very roots.


273
00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:16.847
- Oh, boy!
- Aren't you excited?


274
00:15:16.847 --> 00:15:18.555
- And everybody loves it.
- Have you seen it?


275
00:15:18.555 --> 00:15:21.472
Dinah Shore:
Please welcome
Mr. Steven Spielberg.


276
00:15:21.472 --> 00:15:24.222
- ( applause )
- ( music playing )


277
00:15:26.639 --> 00:15:28.931
When did you first
really get interested
in movies?


278
00:15:28.931 --> 00:15:30.388
When I was
a bad little kid.


279
00:15:30.388 --> 00:15:32.222
- Really?
- About, yeah, 13 years old.


280
00:15:32.222 --> 00:15:34.597
- That was the whole thing?
- Very early starter, yeah.


281
00:15:34.597 --> 00:15:36.305
Not-- I didn't
take it seriously.


282
00:15:36.305 --> 00:15:38.305
I did it--
like some people paint


283
00:15:38.305 --> 00:15:41.014
and some people like to,
you know, drive little cars,


284
00:15:41.014 --> 00:15:42.597
and I liked to make
little movies.


285
00:15:42.597 --> 00:15:45.805
I didn't realize
there was 50 years
of filmmaking before me.


286
00:15:45.805 --> 00:15:48.181
And I lived
in Phoenix, Arizona,


287
00:15:48.181 --> 00:15:51.056
where you can listen
to cactus grow if you have
nothing better to do.


288
00:15:51.056 --> 00:15:53.139
- Yeah.
- And I took
a movie camera


289
00:15:53.139 --> 00:15:55.597
and I was learning
sort of the ABCs
as I went along,


290
00:15:55.597 --> 00:15:57.972
but it was just fun,
it was something to do.


291
00:15:57.972 --> 00:15:59.972
( music playing )

292
00:16:06.388 --> 00:16:08.305
Spielberg:
I really wanted
my childhood to be


293
00:16:08.305 --> 00:16:11.764
sort of the pie-in-the-sky,
Norman Rockwell American Dream.


294
00:16:15.555 --> 00:16:18.680
My dad was this computer genius
that was on the team
that invented


295
00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:22.139
the first commercial
data processing machine
at RCA back in 1950,


296
00:16:22.139 --> 00:16:25.555
and so my dad
was headhunted a lot and
went from company to company.


297
00:16:25.555 --> 00:16:27.889
Like Army brats,
we moved from place to place.


298
00:16:27.889 --> 00:16:31.597
But most of my formative years
took place in Phoenix, Arizona.


299
00:16:31.597 --> 00:16:35.347
My father was the American man
who worked very hard.


300
00:16:35.347 --> 00:16:38.014
Sometimes worked six days a week
and he came home late at night.


301
00:16:38.014 --> 00:16:42.056
His career demanded
a lot of time away
from the family.


302
00:16:42.056 --> 00:16:44.555
And my mom
was Peter Pan.


303
00:16:44.555 --> 00:16:46.889
She was a sibling,
not a parent,


304
00:16:46.889 --> 00:16:49.097
because
she was a best friend,


305
00:16:49.097 --> 00:16:52.931
not a primary caregiver.

306
00:16:52.931 --> 00:16:57.513
And she got into trouble
like we got into trouble.


307
00:16:57.513 --> 00:17:00.430
Anne:
Steve had a feeling
that family should be


308
00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:02.889
like "Father Knows Best,"

309
00:17:02.889 --> 00:17:05.139
but we were not
the usual family.


310
00:17:05.139 --> 00:17:08.513
We just kind of were bohemians
growing up in suburbia.


311
00:17:11.764 --> 00:17:15.889
I went to a pet store one day,
and there was a monkey


312
00:17:15.889 --> 00:17:19.555
sitting in a cage
like this, fetal position.


313
00:17:19.555 --> 00:17:22.889
And the shopkeeper said
the monkey was dying.


314
00:17:22.889 --> 00:17:26.305
He had been
taken away from his mother
and he was depressed.


315
00:17:26.305 --> 00:17:28.639
So, I come home,
driving my jeep


316
00:17:28.639 --> 00:17:33.847
with a big cage in the back
and a monkey in the cage.


317
00:17:33.847 --> 00:17:36.513
And I remember
the kids freaked out.


318
00:17:36.513 --> 00:17:38.680
They were so scared.

319
00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:42.555
Steve said, "You know,
in a normal household,


320
00:17:42.555 --> 00:17:44.680
kids say,
'Can we have a monkey?'


321
00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:47.347
And the mother says,
'Are you crazy?'"


322
00:17:47.347 --> 00:17:50.263
You know, when I hear
my stories about


323
00:17:50.263 --> 00:17:54.889
the things I've done,
I think, "That's crazy."


324
00:17:54.889 --> 00:17:56.889
Susan Lacy:
Did you think
she was crazy?


325
00:17:56.889 --> 00:17:58.764
I liked the monkey.

326
00:17:58.764 --> 00:18:00.931
( birds chirping )

327
00:18:00.931 --> 00:18:03.222
( music playing )

328
00:18:03.222 --> 00:18:06.263
Spielberg:
As a child, I spent a lot
of my time watching television,


329
00:18:06.263 --> 00:18:07.805
or listening
to soundtrack albums,


330
00:18:07.805 --> 00:18:10.597
or just sitting around,
looking at the clouds.


331
00:18:10.597 --> 00:18:12.639
My dad was always on me
for that.


332
00:18:12.639 --> 00:18:14.222
He did not
like me getting Cs,


333
00:18:14.222 --> 00:18:17.597
but school was not a place
I was really drawn to.


334
00:18:17.597 --> 00:18:21.388
Nancy:
Steve was a kid that was
sort of watchful and tentative


335
00:18:21.388 --> 00:18:23.305
and in some ways hesitant.

336
00:18:23.305 --> 00:18:26.263
You know, he wasn't
like the normal kids
in the neighborhood.


337
00:18:26.263 --> 00:18:28.388
He wasn't the muscle guy.

338
00:18:28.388 --> 00:18:30.972
You know,
he got bullied a lot.


339
00:18:30.972 --> 00:18:32.305
That was tough.

340
00:18:34.014 --> 00:18:37.680
Most of my demons
were self-inflicted wounds.


341
00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:39.639
They were things
inside myself.


342
00:18:39.639 --> 00:18:41.222
The way I saw myself.

343
00:18:41.222 --> 00:18:45.472
I didn't have a lot
of high esteem for myself,


344
00:18:45.472 --> 00:18:48.805
you know, growing up.

345
00:18:49.889 --> 00:18:52.305
I just was a lonely guy.

346
00:18:52.305 --> 00:18:54.097
J.J. Abrams:
I think that explained a lot


347
00:18:54.097 --> 00:18:57.680
of why and how
he was compelled
to make movies.


348
00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:59.639
It was not just a means
of expression,


349
00:18:59.639 --> 00:19:01.263
but it was
a means of escape,


350
00:19:01.263 --> 00:19:06.222
and it was a means of sometimes
making friends with people


351
00:19:06.222 --> 00:19:08.680
that you couldn't otherwise,
or getting to hang out


352
00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:10.597
with girls that you might not
be able to otherwise,


353
00:19:10.597 --> 00:19:14.014
or just finding a way
to have meaning.


354
00:19:14.014 --> 00:19:15.764
Spielberg:
The camera was my pen.


355
00:19:15.764 --> 00:19:17.430
I wrote my stories
through the lens.


356
00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:20.555
And when I was able to say
"action" and "cut,"


357
00:19:20.555 --> 00:19:22.805
I wrested control
of my life.


358
00:19:22.805 --> 00:19:24.680
( music playing )

359
00:19:34.513 --> 00:19:37.056
Spielberg:
I love films like
the "Sands of Iwo Jima,"


360
00:19:37.056 --> 00:19:38.889
the "Flying Tigers,"
"Battleground,"


361
00:19:38.889 --> 00:19:40.931
films that I'd see
on television.


362
00:19:40.931 --> 00:19:44.680
And I would watch
these things over and over
and over again.


363
00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:46.430
I was really influenced
by all that stuff,


364
00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:47.972
and so my first
couple of movies


365
00:19:47.972 --> 00:19:51.056
were stories
about World War II.


366
00:19:51.056 --> 00:19:53.847
There was
an airport with a bunch
of World War II airplanes


367
00:19:53.847 --> 00:19:55.889
just sitting out there
on the tarmac.


368
00:19:55.889 --> 00:19:58.722
( explosion )

369
00:19:58.722 --> 00:20:01.972
I would take a shot
of my friend with his finger
on the stick


370
00:20:01.972 --> 00:20:04.847
and intercut
actual 8mm combat footage.


371
00:20:04.847 --> 00:20:06.889
A lot of it
shot by John Ford,
by the way.


372
00:20:06.889 --> 00:20:08.722
And made a movie
that looked like


373
00:20:08.722 --> 00:20:10.805
the production value
was off the charts


374
00:20:10.805 --> 00:20:12.597
because the production value
was off the charts.


375
00:20:12.597 --> 00:20:13.889
It was the real thing.

376
00:20:13.889 --> 00:20:17.139
( music playing )

377
00:20:17.139 --> 00:20:18.847
Abrams:
You can just look
at those movies,


378
00:20:18.847 --> 00:20:23.388
and you see the ability
to tell a story without words.


379
00:20:23.388 --> 00:20:26.931
His use
of primitive special effects
was spectacular.


380
00:20:26.931 --> 00:20:28.764
You know, he'd have
big bullet hits,


381
00:20:28.764 --> 00:20:30.263
he'd put little
see-saws of dirt,


382
00:20:30.263 --> 00:20:31.805
so that when his actors
were running,


383
00:20:31.805 --> 00:20:33.472
they'd step
on one piece,


384
00:20:33.472 --> 00:20:35.388
and it would sort of catapult
the dirt up in the air


385
00:20:35.388 --> 00:20:37.722
as if they were being shot
as they were running.


386
00:20:37.722 --> 00:20:40.097
There were things
that he did that just
made complete sense.


387
00:20:40.097 --> 00:20:41.680
You saw the trajectory.

388
00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:43.680
There was something
in the DNA of it that,


389
00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:45.513
despite it being shot
on 8mm film,


390
00:20:45.513 --> 00:20:48.305
was the voice
of that same filmmaker.


391
00:20:48.305 --> 00:20:50.388
But I didn't know
anything about whether


392
00:20:50.388 --> 00:20:53.181
I was gonna have a career
or where this was gonna go.


393
00:20:53.181 --> 00:20:55.097
I just knew that it filled up
the time and it gave me


394
00:20:55.097 --> 00:20:57.639
a tremendous amount
of satisfaction.


395
00:20:57.639 --> 00:21:00.222
And the second
I finished a movie,
I wanted to start a new one


396
00:21:00.222 --> 00:21:04.347
because I felt good
about myself when I was
making a film.


397
00:21:04.347 --> 00:21:06.263
But when I had
too much time to think,


398
00:21:06.263 --> 00:21:11.555
all those scary whispers
would start-- start up.


399
00:21:11.555 --> 00:21:16.056
It was not fun to be me
in between ideas or projects.


400
00:21:19.597 --> 00:21:21.513
( music playing )

401
00:21:26.305 --> 00:21:29.014
Sid Sheinberg:
The lore has it
that as a young man,


402
00:21:29.014 --> 00:21:32.139
Steven was sort of
the Phantom of the Opera,


403
00:21:32.139 --> 00:21:35.680
haunting the lot
of Universal Studios.


404
00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:39.764
He would literally
get on the lot


405
00:21:39.764 --> 00:21:41.847
one way or another.

406
00:21:41.847 --> 00:21:43.764
Spielberg:
I got on the studio
tour bus,


407
00:21:43.764 --> 00:21:45.639
took a jaunt
around the back lot.


408
00:21:45.639 --> 00:21:48.430
And then at one point
they give you a bathroom break,


409
00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:50.181
and I never came out
of the bathroom.


410
00:21:50.181 --> 00:21:54.139
I waited till
I could hear a pin drop,
and then came out.


411
00:21:54.139 --> 00:21:56.305
The bus was gone
and I was on the lot.


412
00:21:56.305 --> 00:21:59.305
James Brolin:
Word was that he went upstairs


413
00:21:59.305 --> 00:22:01.972
in the tower and took an office
on the sixth floor,


414
00:22:01.972 --> 00:22:04.181
and nobody bothered him
for six months.


415
00:22:08.972 --> 00:22:12.097
Dreyfuss:
The story was
he requisitioned an office,


416
00:22:12.097 --> 00:22:14.847
telephone, put his name
on the door.


417
00:22:14.847 --> 00:22:17.097
Eh, I don't believe it,
but you know what they said


418
00:22:17.097 --> 00:22:19.181
in "The Man Who Shot
Liberty Valance"--


419
00:22:19.181 --> 00:22:22.305
when the legend
is bigger than the facts,
print the legend.


420
00:22:22.305 --> 00:22:25.931
Roger Ernest:
One time he sneaked
onto Alfred Hitchcock's set


421
00:22:25.931 --> 00:22:27.847
and watched him
direct a little bit


422
00:22:27.847 --> 00:22:31.388
until he got caught
and was asked to leave.


423
00:22:31.388 --> 00:22:33.847
Steve was
constantly learning,


424
00:22:33.847 --> 00:22:36.597
constantly looking,
constantly asking questions


425
00:22:36.597 --> 00:22:39.014
from all
of the tradespeople--


426
00:22:39.014 --> 00:22:42.181
cinematographer,
lighting, editors.


427
00:22:42.181 --> 00:22:47.555
It was like Spielberg 101
in overdrive.


428
00:22:47.555 --> 00:22:50.513
Spielberg:
I tried very hard
to get into USC Film School,


429
00:22:50.513 --> 00:22:52.222
and I just didn't have
the grades to get in.


430
00:22:52.222 --> 00:22:53.931
And I even had
a personal interview at USC,


431
00:22:53.931 --> 00:22:55.764
and they turned me down
even in person.


432
00:22:55.764 --> 00:22:58.014
So, Universal became
my film school.


433
00:22:58.014 --> 00:22:59.889
( music playing )

434
00:23:02.305 --> 00:23:05.388
Ernest:
Steven was laser focused.


435
00:23:05.388 --> 00:23:10.388
He never lost sight
of the fact that the audience
early on, for him,


436
00:23:10.388 --> 00:23:12.222
wasn't the audience
in the theater.


437
00:23:12.222 --> 00:23:15.722
The audience were
the studio executives.


438
00:23:15.722 --> 00:23:18.805
And he figured out
how to make a film


439
00:23:18.805 --> 00:23:22.014
that will convince
the studio executives that,


440
00:23:22.014 --> 00:23:24.555
"Yes, I have the talent
to be a director.


441
00:23:24.555 --> 00:23:26.430
This is what I can do."

442
00:23:30.847 --> 00:23:34.430
Sheinberg:
I looked at this film,
and I was very taken with it.


443
00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:37.139
I had
a very strong feeling


444
00:23:37.139 --> 00:23:41.097
that this was not
your average young filmmaker.


445
00:23:41.097 --> 00:23:45.263
Spielberg: Sid Sheinberg,
who was President of Universal
Television at the time,


446
00:23:45.263 --> 00:23:48.014
he said, "So, sir,
I saw your film.


447
00:23:48.014 --> 00:23:49.513
Very well made.

448
00:23:49.513 --> 00:23:52.056
I'd like to offer you
a seven-year contract


449
00:23:52.056 --> 00:23:54.513
to come to Universal
to direct television."


450
00:23:54.513 --> 00:23:58.097
He said,
"If you sign with us,


451
00:23:58.097 --> 00:24:02.680
I will support you
as strongly in failure


452
00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:05.263
as I will in success."

453
00:24:05.263 --> 00:24:07.555
And he was true
to his word.


454
00:24:07.555 --> 00:24:12.222
And that was the beginning
of the most important
relationship


455
00:24:12.222 --> 00:24:14.639
I could ever imagine having
in this business.


456
00:24:14.639 --> 00:24:17.972
Dreyfuss:
Steven was known
as the uncrowned prince.


457
00:24:17.972 --> 00:24:19.847
He was the guy
who was gonna make it.


458
00:24:19.847 --> 00:24:22.764
I mean, he was directing
Joan Crawford


459
00:24:22.764 --> 00:24:25.305
when he was 20.

460
00:24:25.305 --> 00:24:27.972
That'll teach you
a lot of things.
( chuckling )


461
00:24:27.972 --> 00:24:31.305
Spielberg:
Joan Crawford is the first
professional SAG member


462
00:24:31.305 --> 00:24:34.305
I ever directed
in my life!


463
00:24:34.305 --> 00:24:37.347
I want to see something!

464
00:24:37.347 --> 00:24:42.805
Trees, concrete, buildings,
grass, airplanes, color!


465
00:24:42.805 --> 00:24:45.805
Scorsese: It was Cassavetes
who said, "If you want to be
a real filmmaker,


466
00:24:45.805 --> 00:24:47.972
you can't be afraid
of anything or anybody."


467
00:24:47.972 --> 00:24:49.805
And Steven's not.

468
00:24:49.805 --> 00:24:51.847
He's there with Joan Crawford
who wants him out every day.


469
00:24:51.847 --> 00:24:55.931
And he's gotta shoot
and be on schedule
and be good,


470
00:24:55.931 --> 00:24:58.181
meaning that
it has to have a vision.


471
00:24:58.181 --> 00:25:00.181
The shots have to have
a point of view.


472
00:25:00.181 --> 00:25:02.388
Spielberg:
But after "Night Gallery"
came out,


473
00:25:02.388 --> 00:25:05.722
there was a lot of criticism
on the fact that I was
a novelty item.


474
00:25:05.722 --> 00:25:08.513
The youngest term director
ever put under contract
in history.


475
00:25:08.513 --> 00:25:11.931
And the producers
who were doing the hiring
wouldn't hire me.


476
00:25:11.931 --> 00:25:13.680
There was
a lot of hostility,


477
00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:16.056
and I had to prove myself
to everybody.


478
00:25:16.056 --> 00:25:19.347
You know, they looked at me
as sort of Sheinberg's folly.


479
00:25:19.347 --> 00:25:22.680
He underwrote me.
Let him find me work.


480
00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:24.639
( music playing )

481
00:25:27.263 --> 00:25:29.472
Brolin:
I had wanted to direct,


482
00:25:29.472 --> 00:25:32.597
and Steven walks in,
and he's a kid!


483
00:25:32.597 --> 00:25:34.764
And I'm envious as hell
right away.


484
00:25:36.639 --> 00:25:38.805
Scorsese:
Steven's able
to walk into a room,


485
00:25:38.805 --> 00:25:41.305
look for a second or two,
say, "Here. Here.


486
00:25:41.305 --> 00:25:44.472
Move that here.
Give me a 25mm here.


487
00:25:44.472 --> 00:25:46.388
Put it this way.
Face forward.


488
00:25:46.388 --> 00:25:48.388
Move it.
Silhouette here.


489
00:25:48.388 --> 00:25:49.972
Two takes, three takes.
That's enough. Thanks.


490
00:25:49.972 --> 00:25:51.722
Let's move on."
It was amazing.


491
00:25:51.722 --> 00:25:54.347
Steven Bochco:
Steven had a gear
in his brain


492
00:25:54.347 --> 00:25:58.555
that automatically translated
words into pictures


493
00:25:58.555 --> 00:26:02.430
almost without it being
a conscious process for him.


494
00:26:02.430 --> 00:26:06.097
There was a unique
visual voice there


495
00:26:06.097 --> 00:26:09.097
that you had to not only
pay attention to,


496
00:26:09.097 --> 00:26:13.764
but you had to give
somewhat of a free rein to.


497
00:26:13.764 --> 00:26:15.805
( music playing )

498
00:26:34.597 --> 00:26:38.222
Spielberg:
My early themes always had
the underdog being pursued


499
00:26:38.222 --> 00:26:40.430
by indomitable forces

500
00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:43.889
of both nature
and natural enemies,


501
00:26:43.889 --> 00:26:47.805
and that person has to rise
to the occasion to survive.


502
00:26:47.805 --> 00:26:49.764
And a lot of that
comes just from


503
00:26:49.764 --> 00:26:51.972
the insecurities
I felt as a kid


504
00:26:51.972 --> 00:26:55.139
and how that bled over
into the work.


505
00:26:55.139 --> 00:26:58.847
I was always the kid
with the big bully,


506
00:26:58.847 --> 00:27:01.722
and "Duel" was my life
in the schoolyard.


507
00:27:01.722 --> 00:27:05.347
The truck was the bully,
and the car was me.


508
00:27:05.347 --> 00:27:07.805
( horn honks )

509
00:27:09.347 --> 00:27:11.388
George Lucas: I was over
at Francis Coppola's,


510
00:27:11.388 --> 00:27:13.639
and "Duel"
was gonna be shown
that night,


511
00:27:13.639 --> 00:27:16.472
so I sort of snuck away
from the party


512
00:27:16.472 --> 00:27:18.931
and said,
"I wanna see this film.
I wanna see what this kid did."


513
00:27:18.931 --> 00:27:21.263
I was sort of on the fence
about Steven.


514
00:27:21.263 --> 00:27:23.056
I said,
"Knows what he's doing,


515
00:27:23.056 --> 00:27:25.597
nice, but a little
too Hollywoody for my taste."


516
00:27:25.597 --> 00:27:27.722
I saw "Amblin',"
and I thought "Amblin'"
was nice,


517
00:27:27.722 --> 00:27:31.263
but it wasn't-- you know,
it was very, very flashy.


518
00:27:31.263 --> 00:27:33.305
It was very,
very professional.


519
00:27:33.305 --> 00:27:35.472
And for the rest of us,
we were all rough-edged,


520
00:27:35.472 --> 00:27:38.263
crazy guys that were doing
much more dirty work.


521
00:27:38.263 --> 00:27:40.097
So, I thought,
"Well, I'll watch
the first half hour


522
00:27:40.097 --> 00:27:43.056
and just see
what he's up to."


523
00:27:43.056 --> 00:27:44.847
And I ended up watching
the whole thing.


524
00:27:44.847 --> 00:27:48.680
And I came down to Francis,
I said, "This guy's amazing.


525
00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:50.430
You really gotta look
at this film."


526
00:27:50.430 --> 00:27:52.388
( cash register dings )

527
00:27:57.097 --> 00:27:59.639
Edelstein:
Right off the bat,
it was clear


528
00:27:59.639 --> 00:28:05.139
that no one moved the camera
like Steven Spielberg.


529
00:28:05.139 --> 00:28:07.555
- ( bell rings )
- ( billiard balls clack )


530
00:28:07.555 --> 00:28:11.847
Edelstein:
Other directors had
a fantastic sense of space.


531
00:28:11.847 --> 00:28:14.181
Orson Welles,
you name it,


532
00:28:14.181 --> 00:28:16.805
people who understood
composition.


533
00:28:19.805 --> 00:28:22.472
But the way
that Spielberg's camera


534
00:28:22.472 --> 00:28:24.639
moved through a shot

535
00:28:24.639 --> 00:28:27.680
and then ended up somewhere
that completely shifted


536
00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:30.056
or intensified the emotion
of the scene,


537
00:28:30.056 --> 00:28:32.889
that was just
a natural gift he had.


538
00:28:32.889 --> 00:28:35.139
Who knows
where that came from.


539
00:28:35.139 --> 00:28:38.097
Who-- but it was
his own technique.


540
00:28:38.097 --> 00:28:40.056
Francis Ford Coppola:
"Duel" was a composition


541
00:28:40.056 --> 00:28:42.889
that had a very elusive
and interesting theme.


542
00:28:42.889 --> 00:28:45.222
You know,
this unknown menace.


543
00:28:45.222 --> 00:28:48.931
Everyone's been on a road
and some idiot has crossed
in front of you,


544
00:28:48.931 --> 00:28:53.222
and, you know, you're tempted
to rev up fast


545
00:28:53.222 --> 00:28:54.889
and go do something
nasty to him.


546
00:28:54.889 --> 00:28:58.597
And here he took this
and made it into a parable.


547
00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:04.764
( horn honking )

548
00:29:11.014 --> 00:29:12.597
Spielberg:
When ABC saw "Duel,"


549
00:29:12.597 --> 00:29:15.181
they were very excited
by what they were seeing.


550
00:29:15.181 --> 00:29:18.263
But at the very, very end
when the truck did not explode


551
00:29:18.263 --> 00:29:20.430
in a pyrotechnics display,

552
00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:22.097
George Eckstein
called me and said,


553
00:29:22.097 --> 00:29:25.388
"Network's really upset
that the truck didn't blow up,


554
00:29:25.388 --> 00:29:28.764
so they're ordering us
to go back to that cliff


555
00:29:28.764 --> 00:29:30.430
and blow the truck up."

556
00:29:30.430 --> 00:29:32.056
And I said,
"I'm not gonna do it."


557
00:29:34.305 --> 00:29:36.305
The death of the truck
is so agonizing.


558
00:29:36.305 --> 00:29:39.430
I said, "I made
that truck die slowly."


559
00:29:39.430 --> 00:29:42.847
The oil, like blood, dripping
off the steering wheel.


560
00:29:42.847 --> 00:29:45.680
The wheel slowly rolling
to a stop.


561
00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:49.097
The fan still going,
but the truck's dying.


562
00:29:49.097 --> 00:29:50.680
I mean, it's the death
of the truck.


563
00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:53.056
That's what the audience
wants to see.


564
00:29:53.056 --> 00:29:55.639
This criminal element
paying--


565
00:29:55.639 --> 00:29:58.597
you know, paying the price
for what it did to this man.


566
00:29:58.597 --> 00:30:02.639
I wouldn't do it.
I wouldn't blow up the truck.


567
00:30:02.639 --> 00:30:06.388
Bochco:
For Steven, the little screen
was an interesting canvas,


568
00:30:06.388 --> 00:30:09.472
and obviously he painted
on it very well,


569
00:30:09.472 --> 00:30:11.722
but he knew
that this screen


570
00:30:11.722 --> 00:30:15.680
simply wasn't
a large enough canvas.


571
00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:18.639
( music playing )

572
00:30:24.181 --> 00:30:26.056
Vilmos Zsigmond:
He's a director who know


573
00:30:26.056 --> 00:30:28.222
how important
cinematography is,


574
00:30:28.222 --> 00:30:32.597
and the way Steven directed
"Sugarland Express"
was so fresh,


575
00:30:32.597 --> 00:30:34.847
you know,
because everything
was on location.


576
00:30:34.847 --> 00:30:39.181
And half of the movie
was inside of a police car.


577
00:30:39.181 --> 00:30:41.972
And that was
difficult thing to--


578
00:30:41.972 --> 00:30:43.847
to keep that alive
all the time.


579
00:30:43.847 --> 00:30:45.847
You know, the angles
and all that.


580
00:30:47.847 --> 00:30:49.555
I see lights,
a whole bunch.


581
00:30:49.555 --> 00:30:51.472
Spielberg:
For me, directing
is camerawork,


582
00:30:51.472 --> 00:30:53.639
and so I'm very
on the front line of that.


583
00:30:53.639 --> 00:30:56.222
I've gotta set up the shot,
I've gotta block the actors,


584
00:30:56.222 --> 00:30:58.222
choreograph the movement
of the scene,


585
00:30:58.222 --> 00:30:59.889
bring the camera
into the choreography,


586
00:30:59.889 --> 00:31:01.722
figure out
when the camera stops,
how it moves,


587
00:31:01.722 --> 00:31:03.597
how far it moves,
what the composition is,


588
00:31:03.597 --> 00:31:06.056
so I've always got
my eye on the lens,
and that's what I do.


589
00:31:06.056 --> 00:31:07.889
I even pick the lens
I want.


590
00:31:07.889 --> 00:31:10.014
( music playing )

591
00:31:14.597 --> 00:31:16.639
Scorsese:
His strength
is really the ability


592
00:31:16.639 --> 00:31:20.222
to be able to tell a story
in pictures instinctively.


593
00:31:20.222 --> 00:31:24.347
I sometimes watch
his pictures on TV
without the sound


594
00:31:24.347 --> 00:31:27.097
just to see the pictures.

595
00:31:27.097 --> 00:31:29.056
( music playing )

596
00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:36.388
Edelstein: Pauline Kael,
one of the most influential
film critics of all time,


597
00:31:36.388 --> 00:31:39.056
wrote in "The New Yorker"
that Steven Spielberg had made


598
00:31:39.056 --> 00:31:43.222
one of the most
phenomenal debuts
in the history of film.


599
00:31:43.222 --> 00:31:44.680
She compared him
to Howard Hawks


600
00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:49.722
in terms of how natural
his feel for the medium was.


601
00:31:49.722 --> 00:31:51.430
What Kael
saw in Spielberg


602
00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:54.805
was someone
with a real movie sense,


603
00:31:54.805 --> 00:31:57.097
but she also said
she wasn't necessarily sure


604
00:31:57.097 --> 00:31:59.430
there was great depth
to go with it.


605
00:31:59.430 --> 00:32:03.222
She didn't see a sign
of an emerging film artist


606
00:32:03.222 --> 00:32:04.764
like Martin Scorsese.

607
00:32:04.764 --> 00:32:07.805
What she saw instead
was the birth


608
00:32:07.805 --> 00:32:11.388
of a new generation
Hollywood hand.


609
00:32:11.388 --> 00:32:14.014
( music playing )

610
00:32:14.014 --> 00:32:17.305
Spielberg:
Martin Scorsese,
filmmaker of "Mean Streets."


611
00:32:17.305 --> 00:32:19.680
This is Brian De Palma,
loud as ever.


612
00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:23.139
( chatter )

613
00:32:23.139 --> 00:32:26.263
- George and Marcia Lucas.
- Hi!


614
00:32:26.263 --> 00:32:27.931
And this is Steven.

615
00:32:27.931 --> 00:32:29.931
Get the camera arranged.
Great.


616
00:32:29.931 --> 00:32:31.805
♪ Time has come today ♪

617
00:32:33.388 --> 00:32:35.555
♪ Young hearts
can go their way... ♪


618
00:32:35.555 --> 00:32:39.014
Scorsese:
In the mid to late '60s,
there was a major change


619
00:32:39.014 --> 00:32:40.680
in the Hollywood
studio system.


620
00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:42.597
It was a very different world
they had to serve,


621
00:32:42.597 --> 00:32:44.764
and there was
a new freedom, too.


622
00:32:44.764 --> 00:32:48.056
Brian De Palma:
So, suddenly the doors were
open for young directors


623
00:32:48.056 --> 00:32:51.972
with very crazy,
seemingly original ideas.


624
00:32:51.972 --> 00:32:55.097
It's almost like, you know,
crashing a party.


625
00:32:55.097 --> 00:32:57.305
( laughs )

626
00:32:57.305 --> 00:33:00.388
Yeah, people
were on the way out,
and we were going in.


627
00:33:00.388 --> 00:33:02.472
Lucas:
We were absolutely obsessed
with movies,


628
00:33:02.472 --> 00:33:04.805
but we certainly
didn't look at it
as a career.


629
00:33:04.805 --> 00:33:06.805
We didn't think we were ever
gonna make any money at it.


630
00:33:06.805 --> 00:33:09.305
De Palma:
There was George
and Francis,


631
00:33:09.305 --> 00:33:11.931
and then there was
Marty and me,


632
00:33:11.931 --> 00:33:14.555
and then
there was Steven.


633
00:33:14.555 --> 00:33:16.347
We came
from different places,


634
00:33:16.347 --> 00:33:20.764
but needless to say,
we were always very happy
to be together.


635
00:33:20.764 --> 00:33:24.388
When we got together,
it was like a fraternity
of directors.


636
00:33:24.388 --> 00:33:27.972
George, put the camera
on the table, on--


637
00:33:27.972 --> 00:33:29.513
I'm gonna hit a ball
into the lens,


638
00:33:29.513 --> 00:33:33.513
and you pick the camera up
at the last moment.


639
00:33:33.513 --> 00:33:35.972
When I got into the group
of the Movie Brats,


640
00:33:35.972 --> 00:33:38.056
as somebody
once called us,


641
00:33:38.056 --> 00:33:40.430
I never--
it was the first time
I felt like an insider.


642
00:33:40.430 --> 00:33:42.472
- ( music playing )
- ( chatter )


643
00:33:47.305 --> 00:33:50.513
Spielberg:
We were very, very fortunate
to be part of that time.


644
00:33:50.513 --> 00:33:52.347
The culture
was converging.


645
00:33:52.347 --> 00:33:53.597
That's Albert.

646
00:33:53.597 --> 00:33:55.889
It was filmmakers,
it was artists,


647
00:33:55.889 --> 00:33:57.805
musicians, performers.

648
00:33:57.805 --> 00:34:00.680
It was an incredible,
fertile time.


649
00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:02.805
And here we have
Amy Irving in the car.


650
00:34:02.805 --> 00:34:05.056
Brian De Palma introduced us
when she was making "Carrie."


651
00:34:05.056 --> 00:34:08.056
- That's how we first met.
- De Palma: Then they started
to go out together.


652
00:34:08.056 --> 00:34:10.430
They were together
and then they were apart,


653
00:34:10.430 --> 00:34:12.388
and then they got back
together again.


654
00:34:12.388 --> 00:34:14.931
- De Palma:
Amy half dressed.
- As usual, sewing.


655
00:34:14.931 --> 00:34:18.014
Yes, sewing Steven's pants
to get him ready


656
00:34:18.014 --> 00:34:20.305
for the big day
that's coming very soon.


657
00:34:20.305 --> 00:34:22.430
- Noogies, noogies.
- ( laughs )


658
00:34:22.430 --> 00:34:23.764
Phillips:
Steven was a nerd.


659
00:34:23.764 --> 00:34:26.347
( laughs )
Master of the world!


660
00:34:26.347 --> 00:34:28.472
Phillips:
A loveable nerd,
but he was a nerd.


661
00:34:28.472 --> 00:34:34.097
He was not into sports
or drugs or rock 'n' roll,


662
00:34:34.097 --> 00:34:37.305
but he was passionate
and he was so enthusiastic.


663
00:34:37.305 --> 00:34:39.263
He used to love
to talk about film,


664
00:34:39.263 --> 00:34:41.555
and it was infectious,
his enthusiasm.


665
00:34:41.555 --> 00:34:44.014
- Steven had
the first car phone.
- ( phone ringing )


666
00:34:44.014 --> 00:34:45.222
It's ringing.

667
00:34:45.222 --> 00:34:48.555
So, Steven and I
used to go around


668
00:34:48.555 --> 00:34:52.931
and call up a girl and say,
"Well, let's get together,"
and she'd say, "Fine."


669
00:34:52.931 --> 00:34:55.931
And then of course we'd be
parked right outside her house.


670
00:34:55.931 --> 00:34:59.222
That was like--
I would say--


671
00:34:59.222 --> 00:35:01.639
it may seem
extremely silly now,


672
00:35:01.639 --> 00:35:04.014
but in those days
it was like a miracle.


673
00:35:04.014 --> 00:35:06.680
He was fun.
He was fun to be around.


674
00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:09.222
I'm Julia Child,
the French chef.


675
00:35:09.222 --> 00:35:10.847
- ( gasps )
- ( laughs )


676
00:35:10.847 --> 00:35:15.056
Today we are carving...
turkey for Thanksgiving!


677
00:35:15.056 --> 00:35:17.305
De Palma:
We were all struggling


678
00:35:17.305 --> 00:35:19.639
with our first
very unsuccessful attempts


679
00:35:19.639 --> 00:35:22.513
to penetrate
the Hollywood establishment,


680
00:35:22.513 --> 00:35:24.972
but Steven was working
all the time.


681
00:35:24.972 --> 00:35:28.347
Coppola:
Steven always was
a creature of the studio,


682
00:35:28.347 --> 00:35:33.097
and his thinking
and his methodology
went that direction,


683
00:35:33.097 --> 00:35:34.889
and he became
a master of it.


684
00:35:34.889 --> 00:35:37.889
He was very fortunate
that the kind of movie


685
00:35:37.889 --> 00:35:41.430
he really had a sense for
was also the kind of movie


686
00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:43.056
that the audience
had a sense for.


687
00:35:43.056 --> 00:35:44.513
We are now
in the Scorsese kitchen.


688
00:35:44.513 --> 00:35:47.972
We are going to show
"Hell's Angels."


689
00:35:47.972 --> 00:35:49.972
Scorsese:
We all gravitated
towards each other.


690
00:35:49.972 --> 00:35:53.139
We had that one thing
that kept us all together,
the one element.


691
00:35:53.139 --> 00:35:58.056
The one kind of a madness
and an obsession with movies.


692
00:35:58.056 --> 00:35:59.889
Spielberg:
We were consulting
with each other,


693
00:35:59.889 --> 00:36:03.181
and unabashedly giving opinions
about each other's works.


694
00:36:03.181 --> 00:36:05.014
Lucas:
It was very much that way,


695
00:36:05.014 --> 00:36:06.931
but we were
still competitive.


696
00:36:06.931 --> 00:36:08.680
"Come and see my movie.

697
00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:10.889
Sit down-- sit here.
The sound's best here."


698
00:36:10.889 --> 00:36:12.639
And blow
the other guy away.


699
00:36:12.639 --> 00:36:15.722
Everybody was sort of
forced to do a better job


700
00:36:15.722 --> 00:36:17.014
to impress everybody,

701
00:36:17.014 --> 00:36:19.014
because Marty had done
this movie,


702
00:36:19.014 --> 00:36:20.722
or Francis had done
that movie.


703
00:36:20.722 --> 00:36:22.639
Scorsese:
They became
like the acid test.


704
00:36:22.639 --> 00:36:27.097
You get some real grounding
and you hope an honesty--


705
00:36:27.097 --> 00:36:28.680
maybe not too honest.

706
00:36:32.056 --> 00:36:33.513
Spielberg:
George showed a bunch of us


707
00:36:33.513 --> 00:36:35.014
"Star Wars"
for the first time,


708
00:36:35.014 --> 00:36:36.680
and there were
no effects in yet.


709
00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:39.388
It was just World War II,
black-and-white stock footage


710
00:36:39.388 --> 00:36:42.722
intercut with blue screen
production color footage,


711
00:36:42.722 --> 00:36:44.056
and then showed
that movie to us,


712
00:36:44.056 --> 00:36:46.014
expecting us to be able
to see the movie.


713
00:36:46.014 --> 00:36:47.764
Lucas:
It was basically
a children's film.


714
00:36:47.764 --> 00:36:49.513
You know, it wasn't what
the other friends of mine


715
00:36:49.513 --> 00:36:51.847
would think of as something
really worthwhile.


716
00:36:51.847 --> 00:36:54.555
Steven was the one person
who was really enthusiastic
about it


717
00:36:54.555 --> 00:36:56.639
and said, "This is gonna be
a huge smash."


718
00:36:56.639 --> 00:36:58.472
Spielberg: But George said,
"I think it's gonna be
a disaster."


719
00:36:58.472 --> 00:37:00.222
He was very depressed,
and we all went


720
00:37:00.222 --> 00:37:02.639
to a Chinese restaurant
after the film was over,


721
00:37:02.639 --> 00:37:06.472
and Brian stood up
and started to geschrei  about,


722
00:37:06.472 --> 00:37:09.889
"What's going on around here?
I don't understand the story.


723
00:37:09.889 --> 00:37:12.056
Who are these people?
Who's the hairy guy?


724
00:37:12.056 --> 00:37:15.222
Where do they come from?
Where's the context?


725
00:37:15.222 --> 00:37:17.472
Where's the backstory?
It's driving me crazy."


726
00:37:17.472 --> 00:37:19.056
Brian went off
on George.


727
00:37:19.056 --> 00:37:21.097
And George just sat there.
He turned red.


728
00:37:21.097 --> 00:37:23.222
George, I think,
wanted to kill him.


729
00:37:23.222 --> 00:37:25.597
But out of all that,
something great came.


730
00:37:25.597 --> 00:37:28.889
Brian basically
said, "You need, like,
an old-fashioned movie


731
00:37:28.889 --> 00:37:31.014
to start the picture
with a foreword,


732
00:37:31.014 --> 00:37:33.805
and all these words
come on the screen,
and they travel up,


733
00:37:33.805 --> 00:37:36.430
and the foreword tells you
what the hell you're looking at


734
00:37:36.430 --> 00:37:39.472
and why you're in the theater
and what the mythology is.


735
00:37:39.472 --> 00:37:41.347
Tell us
what this world is,


736
00:37:41.347 --> 00:37:43.139
and then we can enjoy
the picture."


737
00:37:43.139 --> 00:37:45.722
And that was the birth
of the famous prologue.


738
00:37:45.722 --> 00:37:49.097
De Palma:
Steven came to visit me
when I was shooting "Scarface,"


739
00:37:49.097 --> 00:37:50.764
and I gave him
one of the units


740
00:37:50.764 --> 00:37:54.847
to shoot the Colombians
coming up the staircase.


741
00:37:54.847 --> 00:37:57.597
- ( gun clicks )
- Say hello to my little friend.


742
00:37:57.597 --> 00:37:59.931
De Palma:
So, we were just shooting
people getting shot


743
00:37:59.931 --> 00:38:02.097
for a couple of weeks.

744
00:38:02.097 --> 00:38:04.680
We all had great respect
for each other's work,


745
00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:06.931
and we were just trying
to help each other out


746
00:38:06.931 --> 00:38:10.263
when we would
see things that we thought
could be improved.


747
00:38:10.263 --> 00:38:11.972
Man: All right,
now I am turning the--


748
00:38:11.972 --> 00:38:13.931
the camera over
to our new director--


749
00:38:13.931 --> 00:38:18.014
That's the worst swish pan
I've ever seen.


750
00:38:18.014 --> 00:38:19.931
The worst swish pan
I've ever seen.


751
00:38:19.931 --> 00:38:21.805
He's shooting me.
I'm totally in darkness.


752
00:38:21.805 --> 00:38:23.680
How do you expect
to see anything?


753
00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:26.222
Lucas: It's kind of like
what happened in Paris
in the '20s.


754
00:38:26.222 --> 00:38:29.139
You know,
you get a group of people,
they're all crazy people,


755
00:38:29.139 --> 00:38:32.680
and they're controversial
and doing the same struggle,


756
00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:34.472
but you sort of look at it
later and you say,


757
00:38:34.472 --> 00:38:35.805
"How could
that whole group--"


758
00:38:35.805 --> 00:38:38.805
the whole group
became successful


759
00:38:38.805 --> 00:38:41.639
and dominated
the film business.


760
00:38:41.639 --> 00:38:42.931
It's like,
how could that be?


761
00:38:42.931 --> 00:38:45.056
We were just
a bunch of crazy kids.


762
00:38:45.056 --> 00:38:47.513
But, you know, I think
a lot of it was really
love of film


763
00:38:47.513 --> 00:38:51.222
and all desperate to make film
any way we could.


764
00:38:52.722 --> 00:38:55.139
( music playing )

765
00:39:05.722 --> 00:39:07.555
( gasping )

766
00:39:12.056 --> 00:39:13.513
Oh, my God.

767
00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:19.014
Tony Kushner:
When you're watching
Steven's movies,


768
00:39:19.014 --> 00:39:22.347
you feel like
you're in the presence
of something mysterious


769
00:39:22.347 --> 00:39:26.056
and inexpressible
and poetic.


770
00:39:26.056 --> 00:39:27.972
Enjoying
very simple pleasures--


771
00:39:27.972 --> 00:39:31.430
being scared, being amused,
being dazzled.


772
00:39:31.430 --> 00:39:34.056
( music playing )

773
00:39:45.555 --> 00:39:47.305
Spielberg:
I had been very influenced


774
00:39:47.305 --> 00:39:50.139
by how far Stanley Kubrick
took "2001: A Space Odyssey"


775
00:39:50.139 --> 00:39:53.097
into the world of, really,
expressionist art,


776
00:39:53.097 --> 00:39:56.847
and I wanted to take
"Close Encounters"
even further.


777
00:39:58.764 --> 00:40:01.222
I really wanted the audience
to look at the screen and say,


778
00:40:01.222 --> 00:40:03.222
"I'm having a sighting,"

779
00:40:03.222 --> 00:40:05.722
but I wasn't sure
any of this was gonna work.


780
00:40:07.056 --> 00:40:08.889
Bob Balaban:
It was very risky.


781
00:40:08.889 --> 00:40:10.430
The effects
for "Close Encounters"


782
00:40:10.430 --> 00:40:12.430
basically had never
been done before.


783
00:40:12.430 --> 00:40:16.014
Zsigmond:
He shot the people
with a motion control camera,


784
00:40:16.014 --> 00:40:18.181
making the camera move,
pan, tilt,


785
00:40:18.181 --> 00:40:19.805
whatever he want to do.

786
00:40:19.805 --> 00:40:22.722
And then that's recorded,
actually, on a tape,


787
00:40:22.722 --> 00:40:25.847
and then when Doug Trumbull,
the special effects
supervisor,


788
00:40:25.847 --> 00:40:28.805
goes back to
the post production
facilities,


789
00:40:28.805 --> 00:40:32.097
he can actually duplicate
exactly that camera move.


790
00:40:32.097 --> 00:40:35.139
Balaban: So, when you
married the two images,
they were perfect,


791
00:40:35.139 --> 00:40:38.430
and you could have,
for really about
the first time,


792
00:40:38.430 --> 00:40:39.931
moving special effects.

793
00:40:39.931 --> 00:40:41.972
Always before, you had
to kind of sit there quietly,


794
00:40:41.972 --> 00:40:44.222
because if you moved,
it would destroy everything.


795
00:40:44.222 --> 00:40:45.805
Everybody
is doing that today.


796
00:40:45.805 --> 00:40:48.555
They could not be doing
those effect movies


797
00:40:48.555 --> 00:40:53.139
unless Steven and Doug didn't
try all these things already.


798
00:40:55.931 --> 00:40:59.639
Phillips: The stakes
were so high for Steven
on "Close Encounters."


799
00:40:59.639 --> 00:41:02.639
Columbia Pictures
was literally on the verge
of bankruptcy,


800
00:41:02.639 --> 00:41:05.764
and they bet the farm
on this movie.


801
00:41:05.764 --> 00:41:09.181
He had bankers and Hollywood
breathing down his neck


802
00:41:09.181 --> 00:41:12.222
to prove to the world
that "Jaws" wasn't a fluke.


803
00:41:12.222 --> 00:41:16.805
So, Steven had
a giant responsibility
on his shoulders,


804
00:41:16.805 --> 00:41:20.139
but he had to stay true
to what worked for him,


805
00:41:20.139 --> 00:41:21.889
or it wasn't gonna be
a good film.


806
00:41:21.889 --> 00:41:23.805
And he did.

807
00:41:23.805 --> 00:41:26.972
Win or lose,
he made the movie that
he had dreamed of making.


808
00:41:30.347 --> 00:41:32.181
Spielberg:
When I was a kid,
my dad took me to watch


809
00:41:32.181 --> 00:41:35.347
the Perseid meteor shower
and introduced me to the sky


810
00:41:35.347 --> 00:41:37.680
as a place
of unspeakable wonders.


811
00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:41.014
And because
it was such a beautiful
experience for me,


812
00:41:41.014 --> 00:41:43.972
the heavens promised
if there was ever gonna be,


813
00:41:43.972 --> 00:41:46.764
you know,
a first meeting


814
00:41:46.764 --> 00:41:49.639
between an extraterrestrial
civilization and our own,


815
00:41:49.639 --> 00:41:53.305
it would only be benign
and constructive.


816
00:41:53.305 --> 00:41:54.847
It would be
a conversation.


817
00:41:54.847 --> 00:42:00.347
( high notes playing )

818
00:42:01.430 --> 00:42:04.181
( low notes playing )

819
00:42:04.181 --> 00:42:06.097
Williams:
When these extraterrestrials
are coming here,


820
00:42:06.097 --> 00:42:07.764
we don't know
what they can speak,


821
00:42:07.764 --> 00:42:09.472
what they understand,
or even what they see,


822
00:42:09.472 --> 00:42:11.805
so Steven had this idea
that communication


823
00:42:11.805 --> 00:42:15.889
should be a combination
of sound and light.


824
00:42:15.889 --> 00:42:18.181
( notes playing )

825
00:42:20.889 --> 00:42:26.472
( notes playing )

826
00:42:26.472 --> 00:42:28.639
Spielberg:
I had first thought
mathematics would be


827
00:42:28.639 --> 00:42:31.097
the common language
between intergalactic species,


828
00:42:31.097 --> 00:42:33.764
but I thought it would be
much more emotional


829
00:42:33.764 --> 00:42:37.222
if music was how we spoke
to one another.


830
00:42:37.222 --> 00:42:39.263
( music playing )

831
00:42:41.889 --> 00:42:44.139
Spielberg:
I don't search for films
consciously


832
00:42:44.139 --> 00:42:46.722
that have
a spiritual core.


833
00:42:46.722 --> 00:42:48.889
There's a spiritual part
of myself that happens


834
00:42:48.889 --> 00:42:52.555
to bleed over into the work,
and so I subconsciously,


835
00:42:52.555 --> 00:42:55.056
which is the only choice
that's important,


836
00:42:55.056 --> 00:42:59.347
will find things
that inherently have
something of a belief system


837
00:42:59.347 --> 00:43:02.056
that's beyond
our understanding,
that's a little bit out there.


838
00:43:02.056 --> 00:43:05.889
Balaban:
"Close Encounters" was
much more a personal statement


839
00:43:05.889 --> 00:43:08.222
than his previous
two movies had been.


840
00:43:08.222 --> 00:43:10.430
I mean,
he wrote the script.


841
00:43:10.430 --> 00:43:12.931
It really meant
a huge amount to Steven.


842
00:43:12.931 --> 00:43:15.056
Its genesis
was from a film


843
00:43:15.056 --> 00:43:17.472
I had actually written
and directed when I was 17.


844
00:43:17.472 --> 00:43:20.764
( music playing )

845
00:43:20.764 --> 00:43:24.263
It was the story of
man's first contact with UFOs.


846
00:43:26.222 --> 00:43:31.263
And there were actually
UFOs in "Firelight"
that I created.


847
00:43:31.263 --> 00:43:34.263
I saw a lot of movies,
and I had a whole card
catalogue in my brain


848
00:43:34.263 --> 00:43:36.181
of the things I had seen.

849
00:43:36.181 --> 00:43:38.764
And just by watching movies
with special effects in them,


850
00:43:38.764 --> 00:43:41.931
I could figure
most everything out.


851
00:43:41.931 --> 00:43:44.305
Balaban:
In a way, he had lived
with "Close Encounters"


852
00:43:44.305 --> 00:43:47.014
since he was a child.

853
00:43:47.014 --> 00:43:50.513
And he had a vision
in a real palpable sense


854
00:43:50.513 --> 00:43:52.597
of what this movie
should feel like


855
00:43:52.597 --> 00:43:54.097
when you experience
the movie.


856
00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:58.764
Steven doesn't want to make
little personal movies.


857
00:43:58.764 --> 00:44:01.722
He wants to make
big personal movies.


858
00:44:01.722 --> 00:44:03.931
That's not right.
That's not right.


859
00:44:07.305 --> 00:44:08.805
That's not right.

860
00:44:10.972 --> 00:44:12.639
That's not right.

861
00:44:16.056 --> 00:44:18.181
Spielberg:
I identified
with this obsession


862
00:44:18.181 --> 00:44:20.555
that Richard Dreyfuss
was struggling with.


863
00:44:20.555 --> 00:44:22.222
I was Neary
in that movie.


864
00:44:24.014 --> 00:44:26.805
Something opens up
his imagination


865
00:44:26.805 --> 00:44:28.513
to go for something
that he thinks


866
00:44:28.513 --> 00:44:31.972
is going to provide
some cathartic answer.


867
00:44:31.972 --> 00:44:34.430
He had to go
through chaos


868
00:44:34.430 --> 00:44:36.847
to reach
some kind of clarity.


869
00:44:36.847 --> 00:44:38.847
He was an artist
trying to plumb


870
00:44:38.847 --> 00:44:41.597
the depths
of his imagination.


871
00:44:41.597 --> 00:44:43.181
And so I think
in a sense


872
00:44:43.181 --> 00:44:44.972
"Close Encounters"
is maybe the most,


873
00:44:44.972 --> 00:44:47.056
at least certainly
the most personal film


874
00:44:47.056 --> 00:44:49.847
I had made
up to that point,


875
00:44:49.847 --> 00:44:52.972
because it was also about
the dissolution of a family.


876
00:45:03.222 --> 00:45:05.597
( crying )

877
00:45:10.430 --> 00:45:13.597
Nancy: I remember when we moved
to Northern California
from Arizona.


878
00:45:13.597 --> 00:45:17.181
I had sensed that things
weren't going well
with my parents.


879
00:45:17.181 --> 00:45:19.014
Spielberg:
And one day,
my dad just broke down,


880
00:45:19.014 --> 00:45:21.056
and I never had seen
my dad cry before.


881
00:45:21.056 --> 00:45:22.805
And I just stood there
in the kitchen,


882
00:45:22.805 --> 00:45:25.347
outraged that my father
was not a man.


883
00:45:25.347 --> 00:45:27.972
He was crying
like a little boy.


884
00:45:27.972 --> 00:45:31.430
And I started
screaming "crybaby" at him
as loud as I could.


885
00:45:31.430 --> 00:45:34.181
Just started screaming,
"Crybaby, you crybaby,
you crybaby,"


886
00:45:34.181 --> 00:45:35.722
until they pushed me
out of the kitchen.


887
00:45:35.722 --> 00:45:38.513
Roy, promise me
that you'll go!
Please!


888
00:45:38.513 --> 00:45:42.347
You crybaby!
You crybaby!
You crybaby!


889
00:45:42.347 --> 00:45:45.263
- You crybaby! Crybaby!
- Get out of here!
Get out!


890
00:45:45.263 --> 00:45:46.847
Come on, you guys.

891
00:45:46.847 --> 00:45:47.931
- Crybaby!
- Come on.


892
00:45:47.931 --> 00:45:49.388
You crybaby!

893
00:45:49.388 --> 00:45:51.430
- Be quiet!
- Ronnie: Stop it!


894
00:45:51.430 --> 00:45:55.513
My mom went from being
completely joyful


895
00:45:55.513 --> 00:45:58.597
and celebrative
about life itself


896
00:45:58.597 --> 00:46:04.388
to being full of despair
and palpable sadness.


897
00:46:04.388 --> 00:46:07.222
( music playing )

898
00:46:12.181 --> 00:46:14.305
Spielberg:
I would see my mom
going into the living room


899
00:46:14.305 --> 00:46:17.931
and playing some Schumann
and crying.


900
00:46:17.931 --> 00:46:20.889
Crying to the point
she couldn't see the notes
on the paper.


901
00:46:22.889 --> 00:46:25.680
I'd sit with her
and hold her hand,
talk to her.


902
00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:28.889
She just said,
"I'm so lonely here.
I'm so sad here."


903
00:46:28.889 --> 00:46:30.764
I was going through
the same thing.


904
00:46:30.764 --> 00:46:32.305
And all I knew
was that my dad


905
00:46:32.305 --> 00:46:34.513
was fulfilled up there,
and we weren't.


906
00:46:34.513 --> 00:46:36.931
So, when it was announced
by my mom


907
00:46:36.931 --> 00:46:39.972
that my mom and my dad
were splitting up,


908
00:46:39.972 --> 00:46:41.430
I didn't know
any of the details.


909
00:46:41.430 --> 00:46:43.889
I didn't know
why they were splitting up,


910
00:46:43.889 --> 00:46:45.056
and I didn't
for a long time.


911
00:46:45.056 --> 00:46:46.305
I didn't want to know.

912
00:46:46.305 --> 00:46:49.014
I fell in love
with somebody else.


913
00:46:49.014 --> 00:46:53.347
I was madly in love
with Bernie Adler.


914
00:46:53.347 --> 00:46:56.889
I look back, I think,
"How dare I do that?"


915
00:46:56.889 --> 00:46:58.889
But I really didn't care
at that point.


916
00:46:58.889 --> 00:47:01.805
It was all about me
and my unhappiness.


917
00:47:01.805 --> 00:47:04.764
Anne:
Bernie had been
my father's best friend,


918
00:47:04.764 --> 00:47:06.347
and he was a fixture.

919
00:47:06.347 --> 00:47:07.472
It was like
having an uncle.


920
00:47:10.181 --> 00:47:13.388
Arnold:
I never would tell the kids
that she divorced me.


921
00:47:13.388 --> 00:47:15.722
Instead, I let them think
I divorced her.


922
00:47:15.722 --> 00:47:17.014
Lacy:
Why did you do that?


923
00:47:17.014 --> 00:47:19.014
Protecting her
'cause she's fragile.


924
00:47:20.347 --> 00:47:22.056
And she still is.

925
00:47:22.056 --> 00:47:26.513
And so, I figured I could be
hurt less than she.


926
00:47:26.513 --> 00:47:28.472
I still loved her.

927
00:47:28.472 --> 00:47:31.014
My dad and my stepfather
were best friends.


928
00:47:31.014 --> 00:47:33.305
My mom married
Dad's best friend.


929
00:47:33.305 --> 00:47:34.847
You look at the big picture,
that's shit.


930
00:47:34.847 --> 00:47:37.014
That's really bad.

931
00:47:37.014 --> 00:47:38.597
It didn't hit me
till I got older


932
00:47:38.597 --> 00:47:40.722
that that was
a really tough thing
for Dad,


933
00:47:40.722 --> 00:47:43.513
and I--
my heart bled for him.


934
00:47:43.513 --> 00:47:46.847
Anne:
Steve really thought
my dad left us.


935
00:47:46.847 --> 00:47:51.388
So, during a number of years,
we blocked him out.


936
00:47:51.388 --> 00:47:53.805
And Steve, I know,
blamed him


937
00:47:53.805 --> 00:47:57.847
for the relationship
going bad.


938
00:47:57.847 --> 00:47:59.513
Spielberg:
It was literally
the worst period


939
00:47:59.513 --> 00:48:00.889
of my entire life.

940
00:48:03.056 --> 00:48:05.388
I never told my dad
I was mad at him.


941
00:48:05.388 --> 00:48:07.056
We never had
angry words,


942
00:48:07.056 --> 00:48:09.056
but it was
an estrangement


943
00:48:09.056 --> 00:48:10.722
that I created,
not from my dad.


944
00:48:10.722 --> 00:48:13.056
He was seeking
a relationship with me.


945
00:48:13.056 --> 00:48:15.555
I just went off
and got lost in my work,


946
00:48:15.555 --> 00:48:17.388
the way I saw my dad
get lost in his


947
00:48:17.388 --> 00:48:19.347
all those years
of coming home late


948
00:48:19.347 --> 00:48:21.805
and working weekends
back in Phoenix and
all of that.


949
00:48:21.805 --> 00:48:24.555
I became my father.
I became a workaholic.


950
00:48:24.555 --> 00:48:28.805
And I just lost
the contact with him.


951
00:48:28.805 --> 00:48:32.597
It went on for...

952
00:48:35.181 --> 00:48:36.722
Tom Snyder:
You know, I read
about you today.


953
00:48:36.722 --> 00:48:38.513
You've done four pictures.
That's all.


954
00:48:38.513 --> 00:48:40.680
Four movies
that I can count.


955
00:48:40.680 --> 00:48:42.722
You're not Alfred Hitchcock
who's done over 50.


956
00:48:42.722 --> 00:48:43.972
You're not John Ford.

957
00:48:43.972 --> 00:48:45.430
Can you believe
that you've directed


958
00:48:45.430 --> 00:48:47.097
four pictures
and you're a famous person?


959
00:48:47.097 --> 00:48:50.305
- Can you believe that?
- Can I believe that?


960
00:48:52.222 --> 00:48:53.847
Yes, I can,
as a matter of fact.


961
00:48:53.847 --> 00:48:56.056
I can believe
that I've directed
four pictures,


962
00:48:56.056 --> 00:48:58.889
although it seems like
I've been directing
much longer.


963
00:48:58.889 --> 00:49:02.181
Tom Hanks:
He arrived on the scene
in such a huge manner.


964
00:49:02.181 --> 00:49:03.889
You know,
the way "Jaws" entered


965
00:49:03.889 --> 00:49:06.847
into the consciousness
of the world was huge.


966
00:49:06.847 --> 00:49:09.222
"Close Encounters"
was 10 times as huge.


967
00:49:09.222 --> 00:49:11.889
But Steven was in the process
of inventing himself.


968
00:49:11.889 --> 00:49:14.430
I don't think
he himself knew


969
00:49:14.430 --> 00:49:16.597
where this road
was gonna take him.


970
00:49:16.597 --> 00:49:18.931
I'm sure,
like everybody else
at that age,


971
00:49:18.931 --> 00:49:22.014
he was wondering
was he really as good
as he thought he was.


972
00:49:22.014 --> 00:49:24.472
And turned out he was.

973
00:49:24.472 --> 00:49:26.097
Scorsese:
Once you do "Jaws"


974
00:49:26.097 --> 00:49:28.722
and then "Close Encounters,"
well, where do you go?


975
00:49:28.722 --> 00:49:31.263
The bar, as they say,
is set a certain level.


976
00:49:31.263 --> 00:49:32.472
And what do you do?

977
00:49:32.472 --> 00:49:33.847
You get yourself
into shape


978
00:49:33.847 --> 00:49:35.889
and you jump
over the bar again.


979
00:49:35.889 --> 00:49:37.555
( crickets chirping )

980
00:49:37.555 --> 00:49:40.430
- ( rustling )
- ( heavy breathing )


981
00:49:49.056 --> 00:49:51.597
( screaming )

982
00:49:51.597 --> 00:49:54.181
( screams )

983
00:49:54.181 --> 00:49:58.430
- ( rustling )
- ( both screaming )


984
00:49:58.430 --> 00:50:00.722
Spielberg:
Originally,
my idea for "E.T."


985
00:50:00.722 --> 00:50:03.847
didn't include
an extraterrestrial.


986
00:50:03.847 --> 00:50:08.056
It was gonna be
about how a divorce
affects childhood


987
00:50:08.056 --> 00:50:11.388
and how it really
kind of traumatizes children.


988
00:50:15.472 --> 00:50:19.472
- Dad's shirt.
- Yeah.


989
00:50:19.472 --> 00:50:24.181
( chuckles )
Remember when he used to
take us out to the ball games


990
00:50:24.181 --> 00:50:26.056
and take us
to the movies,


991
00:50:26.056 --> 00:50:28.430
and we'd have
popcorn fights?


992
00:50:28.430 --> 00:50:32.305
So, the overriding theme
was gonna be about


993
00:50:32.305 --> 00:50:34.722
how do you fill the heart
of a lonely child?


994
00:50:34.722 --> 00:50:39.056
Me, human.
Boy.


995
00:50:39.056 --> 00:50:42.889
- Elliott.
- Spielberg: And what
extraordinary event


996
00:50:42.889 --> 00:50:44.889
would it take
to fill Elliott's heart


997
00:50:44.889 --> 00:50:47.222
after losing his dad?

998
00:50:47.222 --> 00:50:50.056
It would take something
as extraordinary


999
00:50:50.056 --> 00:50:52.014
as an extraterrestrial
coming into his life.


1000
00:50:52.014 --> 00:50:54.347
( music playing )

1001
00:51:05.555 --> 00:51:07.388
Drew Barrymore:
Steven, as a filmmaker,


1002
00:51:07.388 --> 00:51:12.472
can create otherworldly,
almost impossible scenarios,


1003
00:51:12.472 --> 00:51:15.222
but do it
in a suburban setting


1004
00:51:15.222 --> 00:51:18.097
and with real families
and real people,


1005
00:51:18.097 --> 00:51:22.680
and so, you are able to go
outer worldly, outer space,


1006
00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:26.222
extraterrestrial,
implausible scenario,


1007
00:51:26.222 --> 00:51:29.805
because it's grounded
in human beings


1008
00:51:29.805 --> 00:51:31.597
and human stories.

1009
00:51:31.597 --> 00:51:34.263
Okay, he's a man
from outer space


1010
00:51:34.263 --> 00:51:36.805
and we're taking him
to his spaceship.


1011
00:51:36.805 --> 00:51:41.680
- Well, can't he just beam up?
- This is reality, Greg.


1012
00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:44.931
Spielberg:
"E.T." was a suburban
American story,


1013
00:51:44.931 --> 00:51:47.139
and suburbia
was all I knew
growing up.


1014
00:51:47.139 --> 00:51:50.222
So, the movies I made
in the '70s, the '80s,


1015
00:51:50.222 --> 00:51:52.764
were a reflection
of what I knew.


1016
00:51:52.764 --> 00:51:54.555
My main religion
was suburbia.


1017
00:51:54.555 --> 00:51:56.639
You know, the families
all getting together,


1018
00:51:56.639 --> 00:51:59.639
nobody gets divorced,
nobody's unhappy
with each other.


1019
00:51:59.639 --> 00:52:01.056
'Course, it's all false.

1020
00:52:01.056 --> 00:52:03.263
Maybe you just
probably imagined it...


1021
00:52:03.263 --> 00:52:07.014
- I couldn't have imagined it.
- Maybe it was a pervert or
deformed kid or something.


1022
00:52:07.014 --> 00:52:08.805
A deformed kid.

1023
00:52:08.805 --> 00:52:11.472
Maybe an elf
or a leprechaun.


1024
00:52:11.472 --> 00:52:13.639
It was nothing like that,
penis breath!


1025
00:52:13.639 --> 00:52:15.931
Elliott!
( laughs )


1026
00:52:15.931 --> 00:52:17.139
Sit down.

1027
00:52:19.472 --> 00:52:22.805
- ( clears throat )
- Dad would believe me.


1028
00:52:23.931 --> 00:52:25.305
( sighs )

1029
00:52:27.847 --> 00:52:31.555
Maybe you ought
to call your father
and tell him about it.


1030
00:52:31.555 --> 00:52:34.097
I can't.
He's in Mexico
with Sally.


1031
00:52:41.931 --> 00:52:44.639
Where's Mexico?

1032
00:52:44.639 --> 00:52:47.181
Spielberg:
I saw my childhood
through this family


1033
00:52:47.181 --> 00:52:50.722
and those young,
wonderful actors.


1034
00:52:50.722 --> 00:52:52.764
Peter Coyote:
When Steven works
with children,


1035
00:52:52.764 --> 00:52:56.097
he brings a kind of
"let's play" feeling.


1036
00:52:56.097 --> 00:52:58.847
He'd have to pull you back.
Grab on to this, right here.


1037
00:52:58.847 --> 00:53:02.181
Coyote:
It's not like somebody
talking baby talk to kids.


1038
00:53:02.181 --> 00:53:05.139
It's just he's really
communicating to them.


1039
00:53:05.139 --> 00:53:08.847
And it's sort of like
direct transmission.


1040
00:53:08.847 --> 00:53:13.347
Now he suddenly turns to you,
his eyes come open.


1041
00:53:15.097 --> 00:53:17.388
( screams, panting )

1042
00:53:19.430 --> 00:53:21.847
Do that to E.T.
Give that joyful scream
to E.T.


1043
00:53:21.847 --> 00:53:24.847
Do the line again,
really excited about
"Are they coming?"


1044
00:53:24.847 --> 00:53:26.931
Breathing, breathing,
breathing, breathing,
breathing.


1045
00:53:26.931 --> 00:53:28.597
- Work yourself up.
- Does this mean they're coming?


1046
00:53:28.597 --> 00:53:30.555
No, work
yourself up even more.
Work yourself up.


1047
00:53:30.555 --> 00:53:33.347
( panting )
Does this mean
they're coming?


1048
00:53:33.347 --> 00:53:35.263
Bigger, bigger.
"Does this mean
they're coming?"


1049
00:53:35.263 --> 00:53:37.472
Does this mean
they're coming?


1050
00:53:37.472 --> 00:53:39.555
- Yes!
- ( screams )


1051
00:53:39.555 --> 00:53:43.014
Melissa Mathison:
He had  to be a bit
of a father, a bit of a pal,


1052
00:53:43.014 --> 00:53:47.014
but he was,
more than anything,
an observer of them,


1053
00:53:47.014 --> 00:53:48.931
and I think that was
a lot of fun for him.


1054
00:53:48.931 --> 00:53:51.347
- All of the kids
were fun for him.
- You gotta take me seriously.


1055
00:53:51.347 --> 00:53:54.388
- This is Halloween, folks.
Hello, my love.
- Hi, Granny.


1056
00:53:54.388 --> 00:53:57.347
Wait a sec.
Drew, this is for you,
my darling.


1057
00:53:57.347 --> 00:54:01.555
- Your apple.
- Spielberg: I wanted to shoot
"E.T." in continuity.


1058
00:54:01.555 --> 00:54:04.639
It gives the kids
a context for the work
they're doing that day,


1059
00:54:04.639 --> 00:54:07.931
'cause they know
that tomorrow will be
tomorrow in the script


1060
00:54:07.931 --> 00:54:10.597
and yesterday was
yesterday in the script.


1061
00:54:10.597 --> 00:54:12.347
So, for young kids,

1062
00:54:12.347 --> 00:54:15.764
it gives them
a real confidence
that they're living a life


1063
00:54:15.764 --> 00:54:17.805
and they're living
a story's life.


1064
00:54:17.805 --> 00:54:20.305
Now they put the machine
on his chest,


1065
00:54:20.305 --> 00:54:23.639
and they're gonna give him
a shock to try to make him
come back.


1066
00:54:23.639 --> 00:54:25.889
And when they give him
the shock,


1067
00:54:25.889 --> 00:54:29.722
it's very loud
and it makes you jump
and cry even more.


1068
00:54:29.722 --> 00:54:31.430
They're putting it
on his chest now,


1069
00:54:31.430 --> 00:54:34.764
and he presses the button,
and it goes, "Pow!"


1070
00:54:34.764 --> 00:54:36.722
- ( crying )
- Are you okay, honey?


1071
00:54:36.722 --> 00:54:39.056
Huh? Are you okay?

1072
00:54:39.056 --> 00:54:41.972
Let's see.
Wipe your doll's face, too.


1073
00:54:41.972 --> 00:54:44.305
Thank you.
Thank you.


1074
00:54:44.305 --> 00:54:47.056
- ( crying )
- Okay. Oh.


1075
00:54:47.056 --> 00:54:51.555
For many years I wondered
about the universal appeal
of this movie,


1076
00:54:51.555 --> 00:54:53.889
and one day,
it hit me.


1077
00:54:53.889 --> 00:54:56.555
There are no two humans
on Earth


1078
00:54:56.555 --> 00:54:58.805
that are father apart

1079
00:54:58.805 --> 00:55:02.139
than those humans
and that alien creature.


1080
00:55:02.139 --> 00:55:03.639
Come.

1081
00:55:07.847 --> 00:55:09.430
Stay.

1082
00:55:12.222 --> 00:55:14.388
Coyote:
And if Elliott,


1083
00:55:14.388 --> 00:55:16.972
and the mother,
and the little girl,


1084
00:55:16.972 --> 00:55:23.014
and the scientist,
could all love and empathize


1085
00:55:23.014 --> 00:55:25.430
and make
a rapprochement


1086
00:55:25.430 --> 00:55:28.597
and a rapport
with this creature,


1087
00:55:28.597 --> 00:55:32.139
so, too, can any two humans
on Earth,


1088
00:55:32.139 --> 00:55:37.056
and I think that was
a subtext that bubbled up
through the film


1089
00:55:37.056 --> 00:55:38.847
and must have
touched something,


1090
00:55:38.847 --> 00:55:40.847
because you don't
get many films


1091
00:55:40.847 --> 00:55:44.056
that are universally
loved and appreciated


1092
00:55:44.056 --> 00:55:45.889
40 years later.

1093
00:55:47.056 --> 00:55:49.222
And it spoke
to something.


1094
00:55:49.222 --> 00:55:53.056
Some desire to be able
to reach across boundaries


1095
00:55:53.056 --> 00:55:55.014
and touch other people.

1096
00:55:56.931 --> 00:56:02.555
I'll be right here.

1097
00:56:12.222 --> 00:56:14.972
Bye.

1098
00:56:14.972 --> 00:56:17.889
Leonardo DiCaprio:
It's a very difficult
balance as a director


1099
00:56:17.889 --> 00:56:22.014
to push a young child
to do a dramatic sequence,


1100
00:56:22.014 --> 00:56:25.597
because you're obviously
manipulating them
to some capacity.


1101
00:56:29.014 --> 00:56:32.347
But Steven knew
how to take them as a director


1102
00:56:32.347 --> 00:56:35.472
into some
of these darker places


1103
00:56:35.472 --> 00:56:38.513
while handling them
with kid gloves.


1104
00:56:38.513 --> 00:56:40.388
( music playing )

1105
00:56:47.764 --> 00:56:50.263
A.O. Scott:
The children
in Spielberg's world


1106
00:56:50.263 --> 00:56:52.472
may be vulnerable,
may be unhappy,


1107
00:56:52.472 --> 00:56:55.597
but they're also very--
they're very powerful


1108
00:56:55.597 --> 00:56:57.097
and they're heroic.

1109
00:56:57.097 --> 00:57:00.597
( music playing )

1110
00:57:02.805 --> 00:57:04.847
Spielberg:
I think all of my movies
that have dealt


1111
00:57:04.847 --> 00:57:06.555
with young people
and their stories


1112
00:57:06.555 --> 00:57:09.972
are about the importance
of empowering these children


1113
00:57:09.972 --> 00:57:12.222
to take control
of the story,


1114
00:57:12.222 --> 00:57:13.931
at least take control
of their lives.


1115
00:57:15.972 --> 00:57:17.056
( yelps )

1116
00:57:19.139 --> 00:57:22.347
Kathleen Kennedy:
Steven intuitively
looks at the world


1117
00:57:22.347 --> 00:57:24.472
through
a lens of innocence,


1118
00:57:24.472 --> 00:57:27.014
and children
do that naturally.


1119
00:57:27.014 --> 00:57:30.472
So, it became
the kind of go-to lens


1120
00:57:30.472 --> 00:57:34.097
that he wanted to use
for his storytelling.


1121
00:57:34.097 --> 00:57:36.263
George Negus:
One of the most interesting
things that I've read about you


1122
00:57:36.263 --> 00:57:39.139
was a headline which said,
"Steven Spielberg is making


1123
00:57:39.139 --> 00:57:43.097
movies and a fortune
while he's still growing up.


1124
00:57:43.097 --> 00:57:44.805
He's really
just a big kid."


1125
00:57:44.805 --> 00:57:47.222
Is that how you see yourself?
Is that a reasonable comment?


1126
00:57:47.222 --> 00:57:51.222
I think it's reasonable.
You have to understand--
how do you define a big kid?


1127
00:57:51.222 --> 00:57:54.139
A responsible big kid,
or just an irresponsible
big kid?


1128
00:57:54.139 --> 00:57:56.805
Because I think
you have to be responsible,


1129
00:57:56.805 --> 00:57:59.263
but you don't want
to lose the child in you,


1130
00:57:59.263 --> 00:58:01.222
because that's
what keeps you young,


1131
00:58:01.222 --> 00:58:03.263
and that's what
keeps you in touch,


1132
00:58:03.263 --> 00:58:06.181
and keeps a smile
on your face.


1133
00:58:06.181 --> 00:58:07.972
I don't quite know

1134
00:58:07.972 --> 00:58:10.597
what it would be like
to become an adult.


1135
00:58:12.847 --> 00:58:14.555
- Oh...
- My...


1136
00:58:14.555 --> 00:58:15.513
God!

1137
00:58:15.513 --> 00:58:17.639
( both screaming )

1138
00:58:19.139 --> 00:58:20.931
Spielberg:
I was feeling my oats


1139
00:58:20.931 --> 00:58:23.181
after both "Jaws"
and "Close Encounters."


1140
00:58:23.181 --> 00:58:26.014
And so I thought,
"I can do a comedy."
Why not?


1141
00:58:26.014 --> 00:58:29.181
If I did those two movies,
why can't I do anything?


1142
00:58:29.181 --> 00:58:30.597
And I have
a sense of humor.


1143
00:58:30.597 --> 00:58:32.597
I go to movies and I laugh
when they're funny.


1144
00:58:32.597 --> 00:58:34.639
Why not tackle a comedy?

1145
00:58:34.639 --> 00:58:37.680
I felt pretty invulnerable
at that time.


1146
00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:39.472
I can assure you

1147
00:58:39.472 --> 00:58:42.222
there will be
no bombs dropped here.


1148
00:58:42.222 --> 00:58:43.972
Bob Zemeckis and Bob Gale
wrote the script,


1149
00:58:43.972 --> 00:58:45.388
and it was lean and mean.

1150
00:58:45.388 --> 00:58:47.347
I'm the one
that stretched the humor


1151
00:58:47.347 --> 00:58:51.014
and the budget
to its breaking point.


1152
00:58:51.014 --> 00:58:54.889
To me, it was an excuse
to just blow a bunch of shit up


1153
00:58:54.889 --> 00:58:58.097
and try to get
an audience to laugh.


1154
00:58:58.097 --> 00:59:01.805
But it was like I committed
a war crime by making "1941."


1155
00:59:01.805 --> 00:59:04.014
Everyone was
eviscerating it.


1156
00:59:04.014 --> 00:59:07.056
I was really devastated.

1157
00:59:07.056 --> 00:59:10.931
Just that feeling of failure,
that cold emptiness,


1158
00:59:10.931 --> 00:59:12.889
where every reminder
of the movie,


1159
00:59:12.889 --> 00:59:15.056
you get that sick feeling
in the center of your stomach,


1160
00:59:15.056 --> 00:59:18.388
and you just
want to go dig a hole
and stick your head in it.


1161
00:59:18.388 --> 00:59:22.388
I mean, for the next year,
I put my head in a lot of holes.


1162
00:59:22.388 --> 00:59:25.555
And my friend George Lucas
came to the rescue.


1163
00:59:25.555 --> 00:59:28.097
( music playing )

1164
00:59:35.056 --> 00:59:37.263
George said,
"What are you doing next?"


1165
00:59:37.263 --> 00:59:40.472
Lucas: And Steven
said that he really wanted
to do a James Bond film.


1166
00:59:40.472 --> 00:59:42.972
And George said, "I have
something much better
than James Bond."


1167
00:59:42.972 --> 00:59:44.680
Lucas:
It's about an archeologist


1168
00:59:44.680 --> 00:59:46.805
and he goes hunting
for supernatural artifacts.


1169
00:59:46.805 --> 00:59:48.889
And Steven said,
"I love it.


1170
00:59:48.889 --> 00:59:50.472
Let's do it."

1171
00:59:50.472 --> 00:59:53.597
Spielberg:
He's not a stock,
standard hero.


1172
00:59:53.597 --> 00:59:55.764
He's not one of these
"just add water"


1173
00:59:55.764 --> 00:59:58.097
and he'll grow into
the hero of your dreams.


1174
00:59:58.097 --> 01:00:00.139
There's a human being
under all of that.


1175
01:00:00.139 --> 01:00:03.347
That's what made Indiana Jones
accessible to audiences.


1176
01:00:03.347 --> 01:00:06.722
- I think
they're trying to kill us.
- I know, Dad!


1177
01:00:06.722 --> 01:00:09.139
Well, it's a new
experience for me.


1178
01:00:09.139 --> 01:00:11.931
- ( plane engine buzzing )
- Happens to me all the time.


1179
01:00:13.181 --> 01:00:15.263
( men yelling )

1180
01:00:18.181 --> 01:00:20.805
( music playing )

1181
01:00:27.847 --> 01:00:31.139
Lucas: It's an action-adventure
movie where every reel
is a cliffhanger.


1182
01:00:31.139 --> 01:00:34.139
Spielberg:
Just pure escapist
entertainment.


1183
01:00:36.347 --> 01:00:38.972
Lucas:
It was gonna be
an all-out "B" movie,


1184
01:00:38.972 --> 01:00:42.639
and "B" movies are fun
because they don't take
themselves that seriously.


1185
01:00:42.639 --> 01:00:44.139
You do them quick.
You do them dirty.


1186
01:00:44.139 --> 01:00:45.972
You cheat on everything
you possibly can


1187
01:00:45.972 --> 01:00:47.555
to save as much money
as you possibly can,


1188
01:00:47.555 --> 01:00:49.181
and you don't worry
about the fact


1189
01:00:49.181 --> 01:00:51.097
that it's not gonna be
"Lawrence of Arabia."


1190
01:00:59.847 --> 01:01:01.764
( crowd cheering )

1191
01:01:01.764 --> 01:01:04.388
Lucas:
We took it to the studios,
and what I didn't realize


1192
01:01:04.388 --> 01:01:07.347
was that Steven didn't have
that great a reputation,


1193
01:01:07.347 --> 01:01:10.139
because he was always going
over budget and over schedule.


1194
01:01:10.139 --> 01:01:13.139
So, every studio said no.

1195
01:01:13.139 --> 01:01:15.847
And some of them even said,
"You know, if you can get
a different director,


1196
01:01:15.847 --> 01:01:19.639
we'll do it, but Steven
can't make that film
for $20 million."


1197
01:01:19.639 --> 01:01:23.181
So, Steven said,
"I promise you, I will not
betray you.


1198
01:01:23.181 --> 01:01:25.597
If it's $20 million,
we will make it for
$20 million."


1199
01:01:25.597 --> 01:01:28.181
Spielberg:
My experience
on three cost overruns,


1200
01:01:28.181 --> 01:01:29.847
"Jaws,"
"Close Encounters," "'41,"


1201
01:01:29.847 --> 01:01:31.639
taught me how to be
more economical


1202
01:01:31.639 --> 01:01:34.222
and benefited
"Raiders" immeasurably.


1203
01:01:34.222 --> 01:01:37.388
Lucas: He had something
to prove, but he also didn't
wanna let me down, his friend.


1204
01:01:37.388 --> 01:01:40.639
You know, it's like,
it wasn't a studio,
it was us.


1205
01:01:40.639 --> 01:01:43.972
Friday night.
If we don't get this,
we don't get the shot.


1206
01:01:43.972 --> 01:01:47.014
If we don't get the shot,
we don't get the movie.


1207
01:01:47.014 --> 01:01:49.931
If they don't
get the movie,
we're all up the creek.


1208
01:01:49.931 --> 01:01:51.722
Spielberg:
George said, "Look,
if you direct this,


1209
01:01:51.722 --> 01:01:53.430
you have to shake my hand
right now and promise


1210
01:01:53.430 --> 01:01:56.056
if it's a big hit,
you gotta direct two more."


1211
01:01:56.056 --> 01:01:58.222
And it was
a great collaboration.


1212
01:01:58.222 --> 01:01:59.805
Dad!

1213
01:01:59.805 --> 01:02:01.181
- What? What?
- Dad!


1214
01:02:01.181 --> 01:02:02.430
- Dad!
- What?


1215
01:02:02.430 --> 01:02:04.597
- Head for the fireplace.
- Oh.


1216
01:02:04.597 --> 01:02:08.388
Harrison Ford:
The "Indiana Jones" movies
were always more about movies


1217
01:02:08.388 --> 01:02:10.222
than they were
about anything else.


1218
01:02:10.222 --> 01:02:13.097
They followed
certain film formulas,


1219
01:02:13.097 --> 01:02:16.056
which freed them
to do silly stuff.


1220
01:02:16.056 --> 01:02:17.931
( music playing )

1221
01:02:24.263 --> 01:02:26.764
Tom Stoppard:
There was something
which I simply adored


1222
01:02:26.764 --> 01:02:28.347
in "Indiana Jones."

1223
01:02:28.347 --> 01:02:30.472
When Harrison
had fallen over a cliff


1224
01:02:30.472 --> 01:02:33.972
and his friends
thought he was dead
and they were peering down,


1225
01:02:33.972 --> 01:02:36.555
and Harrison had come up
without his hat,


1226
01:02:36.555 --> 01:02:39.972
because he'd fallen over
a cliff, for heaven's sake,


1227
01:02:39.972 --> 01:02:44.430
and a mysterious breeze
blows the hat into frame.
( chuckles )


1228
01:02:44.430 --> 01:02:48.014
Ford:
These movies are clearly
made for an audience.


1229
01:02:48.014 --> 01:02:50.056
They're made
for the filmgoer.


1230
01:02:50.056 --> 01:02:53.097
They're meant
for the pure joy
of entertainment.


1231
01:02:53.097 --> 01:02:56.222
Which doesn't mean
that they can't be
emotionally involving,


1232
01:02:56.222 --> 01:02:59.680
which doesn't mean
they can't be smart
from time to time.


1233
01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:01.722
( wind gusting )

1234
01:03:06.597 --> 01:03:11.430
Ford:
But they have to be
satisfying entertainment.


1235
01:03:11.430 --> 01:03:13.680
And Steven and George
have figured out


1236
01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:17.263
how to use the engine
of filmmaking


1237
01:03:17.263 --> 01:03:19.639
to satisfy an audience
in a way


1238
01:03:19.639 --> 01:03:23.139
not so many directors
or producers have.


1239
01:03:23.139 --> 01:03:25.139
( music playing )

1240
01:03:25.139 --> 01:03:27.388
Hugh Downs:
In the century-long history
of motion pictures,


1241
01:03:27.388 --> 01:03:29.931
there has been
one director, just one,


1242
01:03:29.931 --> 01:03:33.305
whose movies have earned
a total of a billion dollars--


1243
01:03:33.305 --> 01:03:35.305
Steven Spielberg.

1244
01:03:35.305 --> 01:03:37.472
Walter Parkes:
Steven is arguably
the most commercial director


1245
01:03:37.472 --> 01:03:39.222
in the history
of motion pictures,


1246
01:03:39.222 --> 01:03:41.639
and I think it's because
he has a deep understanding


1247
01:03:41.639 --> 01:03:43.555
of how the language
of cinema


1248
01:03:43.555 --> 01:03:46.014
elicits an emotional reaction
in an audience.


1249
01:03:46.014 --> 01:03:50.847
And there's no question
that the idea of making movies
that became phenomenons


1250
01:03:50.847 --> 01:03:53.139
was extremely exciting
for Steven.


1251
01:03:53.139 --> 01:03:55.097
But it brought
a lot of mixed results.


1252
01:03:55.097 --> 01:03:56.639
There were people
that hated him,


1253
01:03:56.639 --> 01:03:58.972
people that blamed him
for ruining the movies.


1254
01:03:58.972 --> 01:04:01.513
William Goldman
had written specifically


1255
01:04:01.513 --> 01:04:03.181
that the blockbuster
and Steven


1256
01:04:03.181 --> 01:04:05.513
and George Lucas
had destroyed Hollywood.


1257
01:04:05.513 --> 01:04:08.472
Edelstein:
Some people saw Spielberg
as a repressive force,


1258
01:04:08.472 --> 01:04:12.139
that he was bringing in
a kind of empty escapism


1259
01:04:12.139 --> 01:04:14.931
that was going to take film
in another direction.


1260
01:04:14.931 --> 01:04:17.181
And certainly
with the marketing executives


1261
01:04:17.181 --> 01:04:19.639
who moved
into the studios


1262
01:04:19.639 --> 01:04:21.847
in the late '70s
and the early '80s,


1263
01:04:21.847 --> 01:04:25.263
it was clear
that what they saw
were dollar signs.


1264
01:04:25.263 --> 01:04:27.430
But I wouldn't blame
Spielberg for that.


1265
01:04:27.430 --> 01:04:29.972
Go back to the first review
by Pauline Kael.


1266
01:04:29.972 --> 01:04:32.680
She said he was
a great popular entertainer,


1267
01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:36.139
that he had a feel
for what audiences
wanted to see.


1268
01:04:36.139 --> 01:04:38.305
Why should anybody
apologize for that?


1269
01:04:38.305 --> 01:04:39.764
Let me get you
to react to something


1270
01:04:39.764 --> 01:04:42.056
that one of your peers said,
another director.


1271
01:04:42.056 --> 01:04:43.805
"Steven Spielberg
can't be compared


1272
01:04:43.805 --> 01:04:46.513
with people
like Mike Nichols
and Barry Levinson.


1273
01:04:46.513 --> 01:04:49.097
There is a place
for mass entertainment,


1274
01:04:49.097 --> 01:04:50.972
but it shouldn't
be confused


1275
01:04:50.972 --> 01:04:55.513
with art or quality,
award-winning filmmaking."


1276
01:04:55.513 --> 01:04:58.139
Sometimes I think
that statements like that


1277
01:04:58.139 --> 01:05:00.097
are pretentious
in themselves,


1278
01:05:00.097 --> 01:05:02.680
because it sort of says
that, you know,


1279
01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:06.347
art is serious
and art can't be--
can't move you.


1280
01:05:06.347 --> 01:05:11.222
Art can't be
on a bicycle with E.T.
and fly across the moon,


1281
01:05:11.222 --> 01:05:12.931
that that can't be art.

1282
01:05:12.931 --> 01:05:15.430
Scott:
If you're making
the kinds of movies


1283
01:05:15.430 --> 01:05:17.889
that make the kinds of money
that his movies do,


1284
01:05:17.889 --> 01:05:20.388
and if you're making
franchise entertainment


1285
01:05:20.388 --> 01:05:23.056
or just something that
appeals to a lot of people


1286
01:05:23.056 --> 01:05:26.222
and is unapologetically
mainstream entertainment,


1287
01:05:26.222 --> 01:05:30.513
then there's a little bit
of, I think, suspicion.


1288
01:05:30.513 --> 01:05:34.097
You know, how can
we take you seriously
as an artist?


1289
01:05:34.097 --> 01:05:36.931
Come on, girl,
'cause I'm waiting for you.


1290
01:05:36.931 --> 01:05:38.472
( chuckles )

1291
01:05:42.181 --> 01:05:45.263
You cut me
and I'll kill you.


1292
01:05:45.263 --> 01:05:49.513
Spielberg:
I was looking for a different
perception of myself.


1293
01:05:49.513 --> 01:05:51.388
And if I didn't want
to consciously


1294
01:05:51.388 --> 01:05:53.555
make a departure
and prove something,


1295
01:05:53.555 --> 01:05:55.931
not just to myself
but to everyone else,


1296
01:05:55.931 --> 01:05:58.805
I might not have chosen
"Color Purple" as my next movie.


1297
01:05:58.805 --> 01:06:01.222
But it was my first
really mature film,


1298
01:06:01.222 --> 01:06:05.680
which took on, you know,
substantive, humanistic
subject matter.


1299
01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:09.805
I was turning 40
and I was looking at life
perhaps less optimistically.


1300
01:06:09.805 --> 01:06:12.263
And so, I knew
this was gonna be
a very sobering journey,


1301
01:06:12.263 --> 01:06:14.097
and I was willing
to take it on.


1302
01:06:14.097 --> 01:06:17.139
All my life
I had to fight.


1303
01:06:17.139 --> 01:06:21.139
I had to fight my daddy,
I had to fight my uncles,


1304
01:06:21.139 --> 01:06:23.722
I had to fight
my brothers.


1305
01:06:23.722 --> 01:06:26.722
A girl child ain't safe
in a family of mens,


1306
01:06:26.722 --> 01:06:30.805
but I ain't never thought
I had to fight in my own house!


1307
01:06:32.263 --> 01:06:34.889
I loves Harpo.

1308
01:06:34.889 --> 01:06:37.931
God knows I do,

1309
01:06:37.931 --> 01:06:42.722
but I'll kill him dead
before I let him beat me.


1310
01:06:42.722 --> 01:06:45.931
Oprah Winfrey:
For Steven to even
take on this material


1311
01:06:45.931 --> 01:06:47.847
was a really big deal,

1312
01:06:47.847 --> 01:06:49.847
because you're messing
in some territory


1313
01:06:49.847 --> 01:06:52.931
where if you get it wrong,
then you get a lot
of people upset.


1314
01:06:52.931 --> 01:06:56.805
He wanted to create not only
an African-American worldview,


1315
01:06:56.805 --> 01:06:59.764
but a matriarchal world

1316
01:06:59.764 --> 01:07:04.847
in the presence
of patriarchal repression
and violence.


1317
01:07:04.847 --> 01:07:07.181
And I truly believe
that he wanted


1318
01:07:07.181 --> 01:07:10.388
to stretch himself in a way
that he never had before.


1319
01:07:10.388 --> 01:07:12.722
Hoberman:
And he does push himself,


1320
01:07:12.722 --> 01:07:15.680
but he's not gonna push
himself too far in advance--


1321
01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:18.972
the audience
or maybe his own,


1322
01:07:18.972 --> 01:07:20.972
you know,
core inclination.


1323
01:07:20.972 --> 01:07:23.056
He don't ever ask me
how I feel.


1324
01:07:23.056 --> 01:07:26.555
Just never asked me
nothing about myself.


1325
01:07:26.555 --> 01:07:29.555
Just climb on top of me,
do his business.


1326
01:07:29.555 --> 01:07:32.597
"Do his business"?
Do his bu--


1327
01:07:32.597 --> 01:07:34.472
why, Miss Celie,
you sound like


1328
01:07:34.472 --> 01:07:38.181
he going to the toilet
on you.


1329
01:07:38.181 --> 01:07:39.972
That's what it feel like.

1330
01:07:39.972 --> 01:07:42.222
Spielberg:
I got in trouble
with several critics


1331
01:07:42.222 --> 01:07:44.430
who didn't like
that I shied away


1332
01:07:44.430 --> 01:07:46.805
from the love story
between Shug and Celie.


1333
01:07:46.805 --> 01:07:51.513
And the scene
where Shug Avery shows Celie,
with a mirror, her vagina,


1334
01:07:51.513 --> 01:07:54.805
that that did not
go into the movie,


1335
01:07:54.805 --> 01:07:56.722
which would've
really changed


1336
01:07:56.722 --> 01:08:00.931
the entire nature and tone
of the film.


1337
01:08:00.931 --> 01:08:04.555
I just didn't go
for the full monty
the way the book did.


1338
01:08:04.555 --> 01:08:08.847
I might've done that
had I made the movie

1339
01:08:08.847 --> 01:08:11.639
I was just timid.
I was just a little embarrassed.


1340
01:08:11.639 --> 01:08:13.764
I just wasn't
the right guy to do that.


1341
01:08:15.931 --> 01:08:19.472
Kennedy:
Steven was telling
the story that Alice wrote,


1342
01:08:19.472 --> 01:08:22.597
and he was trying
to access that


1343
01:08:22.597 --> 01:08:25.847
from his personal
point of view.


1344
01:08:25.847 --> 01:08:29.972
He could never go
where Alice went
with that book.


1345
01:08:29.972 --> 01:08:32.263
( music playing )

1346
01:08:43.764 --> 01:08:48.014
Maslin:
That book was appreciated
for its grit and its realism,


1347
01:08:48.014 --> 01:08:52.097
and neither of those
were qualities that
he was known for.


1348
01:08:52.097 --> 01:08:56.472
He was just asking for it
by even going anywhere
near that.


1349
01:08:56.472 --> 01:08:58.972
Edelstein:
Nobody really wanted
Steven Spielberg


1350
01:08:58.972 --> 01:09:00.805
to be a gritty filmmaker.

1351
01:09:00.805 --> 01:09:02.639
That wasn't
his sensibility.


1352
01:09:02.639 --> 01:09:05.722
But with
"The Color Purple,"
colors are exact,


1353
01:09:05.722 --> 01:09:08.139
the settings have been built
from the ground up


1354
01:09:08.139 --> 01:09:10.222
according
to his specifications.


1355
01:09:10.222 --> 01:09:16.097
There's something so false
and so Disney storyboard-like


1356
01:09:16.097 --> 01:09:18.014
about that movie.

1357
01:09:18.014 --> 01:09:20.305
Geffen:
You know, he wanted
to make a prettier picture


1358
01:09:20.305 --> 01:09:22.472
than was intended
in the text.


1359
01:09:22.472 --> 01:09:23.680
That's Steven.

1360
01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:25.847
He wants to make
everything like that.


1361
01:09:25.847 --> 01:09:28.014
He wants to make
life like that.


1362
01:09:33.056 --> 01:09:34.513
I have a baby
on the way,


1363
01:09:34.513 --> 01:09:37.181
and the child is going
to change my life.


1364
01:09:37.181 --> 01:09:40.347
- It already has, in a way.
- Shalit: Are you nervous
about it or what?


1365
01:09:40.347 --> 01:09:41.931
I'm not nervous
about it at all, no.


1366
01:09:41.931 --> 01:09:43.764
I just think
it's the best thing


1367
01:09:43.764 --> 01:09:46.472
that's ever happened
to me and to Amy.


1368
01:09:46.472 --> 01:09:48.181
We really can't wait
for this.


1369
01:09:51.597 --> 01:09:53.847
Spielberg:
I think the destiny
of Amy and I


1370
01:09:53.847 --> 01:09:55.931
was to bring Max
into the world,


1371
01:09:55.931 --> 01:09:59.722
which was such
a beautiful thing.


1372
01:09:59.722 --> 01:10:04.056
Before that,
I'm not sure I knew
what a personal life was.


1373
01:10:04.056 --> 01:10:06.889
I thought life began

1374
01:10:06.889 --> 01:10:10.388
with, you know,
"Action!"


1375
01:10:10.388 --> 01:10:11.555
And then, "Cut!"

1376
01:10:13.513 --> 01:10:15.305
After my mom and dad
broke up,


1377
01:10:15.305 --> 01:10:17.513
I always thought
that I would do my best


1378
01:10:17.513 --> 01:10:19.680
that if I ever decided
someday to get married,


1379
01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:21.181
I wouldn't get divorced.

1380
01:10:21.181 --> 01:10:22.722
And then,
of course, I did.


1381
01:10:22.722 --> 01:10:24.931
( music playing )

1382
01:10:27.931 --> 01:10:31.347
Divorce in any situation
is painful.


1383
01:10:31.347 --> 01:10:34.305
And it's especially
painful for me


1384
01:10:34.305 --> 01:10:37.722
because I am a child
of divorce


1385
01:10:37.722 --> 01:10:39.388
and I know
what it felt like.


1386
01:10:39.388 --> 01:10:42.597
And so, you know,
I felt terrible for Max,


1387
01:10:42.597 --> 01:10:45.139
that he had
to endure that.


1388
01:10:48.597 --> 01:10:50.513
- ( music playing )
- ( people shouting )


1389
01:10:50.513 --> 01:10:54.097
- Jamie: My plane.
- Jamie! Jamie!


1390
01:10:57.931 --> 01:10:59.097
Mom?

1391
01:11:01.222 --> 01:11:03.097
- Mom?
- Frank Marshall:
"Empire of the Sun"


1392
01:11:03.097 --> 01:11:05.764
was about this young boy
growing up in Shanghai


1393
01:11:05.764 --> 01:11:07.764
who gets separated
from his parents


1394
01:11:07.764 --> 01:11:09.931
during
the Japanese invasion.


1395
01:11:09.931 --> 01:11:11.513
Mommy!

1396
01:11:11.513 --> 01:11:13.680
- Jamie!
- Mommy!


1397
01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:16.972
And he goes through
a tremendous transformation


1398
01:11:16.972 --> 01:11:20.430
and growing-up process.

1399
01:11:20.430 --> 01:11:22.931
Spielberg:
It was playing on
what I knew were my strengths,


1400
01:11:22.931 --> 01:11:26.513
being able
to take the dark,
grim reality of war


1401
01:11:26.513 --> 01:11:28.680
and put it
with a child's approach


1402
01:11:28.680 --> 01:11:31.931
in the way
this particular special child
saw that war.


1403
01:11:31.931 --> 01:11:34.181
( crowd clamoring )

1404
01:11:40.347 --> 01:11:42.056
Spielberg:
It was based
on the experiences


1405
01:11:42.056 --> 01:11:43.430
that J.G. Ballard had

1406
01:11:43.430 --> 01:11:45.972
in a Japanese
internment camp.


1407
01:11:49.139 --> 01:11:51.972
Jim was a lost boy
trying to figure out


1408
01:11:51.972 --> 01:11:53.972
where he belongs
in this world.


1409
01:11:56.139 --> 01:11:58.555
It's a movie about
growing up too quickly


1410
01:11:58.555 --> 01:12:01.388
and abandoning everything
that you once used


1411
01:12:01.388 --> 01:12:03.014
to keep yourself safe.

1412
01:12:06.680 --> 01:12:09.430
When you have nothing
to keep yourself safe,


1413
01:12:09.430 --> 01:12:11.513
you become a survivor
like all the rest,


1414
01:12:11.513 --> 01:12:13.388
and you grow up
awfully quickly.


1415
01:12:15.056 --> 01:12:16.764
Christian Bale:
It's an extraordinary story


1416
01:12:16.764 --> 01:12:19.181
of the resilience
of children,


1417
01:12:19.181 --> 01:12:21.222
this incredible survivor

1418
01:12:21.222 --> 01:12:23.931
who manages to have
more fortitude to him


1419
01:12:23.931 --> 01:12:27.889
than, really,
any of the adults
around him.


1420
01:12:32.931 --> 01:12:36.805
Scorsese:
It's in the great tradition
of epic filmmaking.


1421
01:12:36.805 --> 01:12:40.472
That sports stadium
at the end when all the goods,


1422
01:12:40.472 --> 01:12:42.680
all the stuff
that had been stolen
is there,


1423
01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:45.388
the surrealism of that

1424
01:12:45.388 --> 01:12:50.388
and what it makes you feel
at that time and place,


1425
01:12:50.388 --> 01:12:51.764
the sense of what
the world was like,


1426
01:12:51.764 --> 01:12:55.263
how it had fallen apart,
all of civilization.


1427
01:12:55.263 --> 01:12:57.513
( music playing )

1428
01:13:11.805 --> 01:13:16.347
Scorsese:
And then, something even
more disturbingly beautiful,


1429
01:13:16.347 --> 01:13:19.430
and that is the glow
from the atom bomb.


1430
01:13:24.305 --> 01:13:27.764
It's like
a soul transcending
into another life.


1431
01:13:29.181 --> 01:13:31.847
Mrs. Victor.

1432
01:13:31.847 --> 01:13:37.305
This is very poetic
and... mystical.


1433
01:13:40.347 --> 01:13:43.764
- ( man speaks Japanese )
- ( boy singing in Welsh )


1434
01:13:47.764 --> 01:13:49.430
Stoppard:
This was war


1435
01:13:49.430 --> 01:13:53.680
and it was death
and real horror.


1436
01:13:53.680 --> 01:13:56.097
And it was like
an end of innocence


1437
01:13:56.097 --> 01:13:58.430
for the Spielberg child.

1438
01:13:58.430 --> 01:14:00.722
( children's choir
singing in Welsh )


1439
01:14:00.722 --> 01:14:03.263
Stoppard:
I think it was
a truly great film,


1440
01:14:03.263 --> 01:14:05.597
but, for me,
it ultimately shaded


1441
01:14:05.597 --> 01:14:10.847
into an unnecessary softness
or sentimentality.


1442
01:14:10.847 --> 01:14:12.722
I don't know
where it comes from,


1443
01:14:12.722 --> 01:14:15.722
but he likes
and enjoys sentiment.


1444
01:14:15.722 --> 01:14:17.139
It's part of him.

1445
01:14:26.764 --> 01:14:29.305
Scott:
At the time, he was not
dismissed, exactly,


1446
01:14:29.305 --> 01:14:31.931
by a lot of critics,
but sort of looked at
a little skeptically.


1447
01:14:31.931 --> 01:14:33.305
"Oh, he wants
to be serious now.


1448
01:14:33.305 --> 01:14:34.972
Oh, he's trying to make
serious movies.


1449
01:14:34.972 --> 01:14:37.263
Oh, now he wants it"--
which, I mean--


1450
01:14:37.263 --> 01:14:40.847
it's such
a kind of nasty thing


1451
01:14:40.847 --> 01:14:42.472
to say about any artist.

1452
01:14:42.472 --> 01:14:44.889
Kennedy:
It definitely hurt
his feelings.


1453
01:14:44.889 --> 01:14:46.513
I don't think anybody
as an artist


1454
01:14:46.513 --> 01:14:49.139
wants to feel like
they're being pigeonholed


1455
01:14:49.139 --> 01:14:53.014
in a way that other people
are determining who they are.


1456
01:14:53.014 --> 01:14:55.430
And when Steven
began to explore


1457
01:14:55.430 --> 01:14:57.889
other kinds
of more serious stories,


1458
01:14:57.889 --> 01:15:00.764
they were very reluctant
to let him do that.


1459
01:15:00.764 --> 01:15:03.305
That was like,
"How dare you,
Steven Spielberg?


1460
01:15:03.305 --> 01:15:05.847
We've determined that you make
these kind of movies,


1461
01:15:05.847 --> 01:15:08.889
so why are you suddenly
trying to make this?"


1462
01:15:08.889 --> 01:15:11.056
He doesn't
over-intellectualize,


1463
01:15:11.056 --> 01:15:15.181
but maybe as a filmmaker,
Steven was using those movies


1464
01:15:15.181 --> 01:15:17.722
as stepping stones
along the way.


1465
01:15:17.722 --> 01:15:20.263
He didn't know
where he was headed,


1466
01:15:20.263 --> 01:15:23.680
but I think he was exercising
those muscles, in a way,


1467
01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:26.472
to recognize
he could go there,


1468
01:15:26.472 --> 01:15:28.472
that it was okay.

1469
01:15:31.014 --> 01:15:33.263
( man singing
in Hebrew )


1470
01:15:41.056 --> 01:15:43.931
Spielberg:
My very first memory--
I was in a stroller.


1471
01:15:43.931 --> 01:15:45.639
I just remember
being wheeled somewhere,


1472
01:15:45.639 --> 01:15:49.139
and my grandmother
and grandfather were with me.


1473
01:15:49.139 --> 01:15:51.722
( singing continues )

1474
01:15:51.722 --> 01:15:55.222
We went into
this underground space.


1475
01:15:55.222 --> 01:15:58.764
There was a red light
over a set of doors.


1476
01:16:01.764 --> 01:16:03.639
And I just remember
getting closer and closer


1477
01:16:03.639 --> 01:16:06.347
to this red light
where all these old men--


1478
01:16:06.347 --> 01:16:11.097
just men were all
chanting something.


1479
01:16:11.097 --> 01:16:14.139
And the red light
was the Eternal Light,
the Ner Tamid,


1480
01:16:14.139 --> 01:16:16.972
and that's
my very first memory.


1481
01:16:19.805 --> 01:16:23.014
- Lacy: Do you believe
in God?
- Yes.


1482
01:16:23.014 --> 01:16:25.097
Tell me about that.
Where where does...?


1483
01:16:25.097 --> 01:16:27.472
It comes from my--

1484
01:16:27.472 --> 01:16:31.139
you know, my spiritual--
not even spiritual,


1485
01:16:31.139 --> 01:16:34.056
my religious roots
and family.


1486
01:16:37.305 --> 01:16:41.014
All my grandparents had
a very strong influence
over me.


1487
01:16:41.014 --> 01:16:43.388
My grandfather, Fievel,
played guitar


1488
01:16:43.388 --> 01:16:45.680
and he sang
all Yiddish Russian songs.


1489
01:16:45.680 --> 01:16:47.597
And my grandmother,
Jennie,


1490
01:16:47.597 --> 01:16:50.555
taught English to Hungarian
Holocaust survivors.


1491
01:16:54.931 --> 01:16:58.014
We were Orthodox.
I was raised Orthodox.


1492
01:16:58.014 --> 01:17:01.097
And tradition has been
a huge part of my family,


1493
01:17:01.097 --> 01:17:03.056
and religious studies,
and Hebrew school,


1494
01:17:03.056 --> 01:17:07.263
and bar mitzvahs,
and bat mitzvahs
for my sisters.


1495
01:17:07.263 --> 01:17:10.305
But we always
lived in neighborhoods
where there were no Jews.


1496
01:17:10.305 --> 01:17:14.014
And there was
a real cultural divide
in those days


1497
01:17:14.014 --> 01:17:16.263
between Jewish people
and Gentiles,


1498
01:17:16.263 --> 01:17:18.430
a real cultural divide.

1499
01:17:18.430 --> 01:17:20.056
Adler:
I remember
that at one point,


1500
01:17:20.056 --> 01:17:23.639
kids were standing outside
and chanting


1501
01:17:23.639 --> 01:17:26.056
"the Spielbergs
are dirty Jews."


1502
01:17:26.056 --> 01:17:29.347
Spielberg:
I certainly experienced
being excluded


1503
01:17:29.347 --> 01:17:32.472
and being picked on
and discriminated against.


1504
01:17:32.472 --> 01:17:34.305
All I wanted to do
was fit in.


1505
01:17:34.305 --> 01:17:37.972
And by being Jewish,
there was no way I could
fit into anything.


1506
01:17:37.972 --> 01:17:40.639
My grandfather
would come over
to spend a week with us,


1507
01:17:40.639 --> 01:17:43.347
and I'd be playing
in the front yard
seven houses down,


1508
01:17:43.347 --> 01:17:45.181
and my grandfather
would stand on our front porch


1509
01:17:45.181 --> 01:17:47.388
and yell my Hebrew name,
"Shmuel!"


1510
01:17:47.388 --> 01:17:49.430
As loud
as he could, "Shmuel!"


1511
01:17:49.430 --> 01:17:53.555
And all my friends would say,
"Is he talking to you?
That's your house."


1512
01:17:53.555 --> 01:17:56.222
And I immediately denied
that that was me.


1513
01:17:56.222 --> 01:17:59.056
"No, he must be calling
somebody else."


1514
01:17:59.056 --> 01:18:00.889
"Is your name Shmuel?"

1515
01:18:00.889 --> 01:18:02.430
And all my friends
started laughing.


1516
01:18:02.430 --> 01:18:04.139
"Shmuel?
What's Shmuel?"


1517
01:18:04.139 --> 01:18:05.430
And meanwhile,
in the background,


1518
01:18:05.430 --> 01:18:07.222
you can hear
my grandfather yelling


1519
01:18:07.222 --> 01:18:09.555
with a Russian accent,
"Shmuel!"


1520
01:18:09.555 --> 01:18:11.430
Anne:
Steve did not
want to be Jewish.


1521
01:18:11.430 --> 01:18:13.472
He didn't want to be Jewish
because it made us


1522
01:18:13.472 --> 01:18:15.181
too different
from everybody.


1523
01:18:15.181 --> 01:18:17.931
And the "Father Knows Best"
family


1524
01:18:17.931 --> 01:18:20.139
is an assimilated family.

1525
01:18:20.139 --> 01:18:22.764
And I think
he really yearned for that.


1526
01:18:22.764 --> 01:18:27.555
I began to deny
my Jewishness,


1527
01:18:27.555 --> 01:18:29.680
you know, began to deny

1528
01:18:29.680 --> 01:18:32.388
everything that I had
accepted as a child


1529
01:18:32.388 --> 01:18:33.931
and was not
willing to accept


1530
01:18:33.931 --> 01:18:36.388
if it was going
to make me a pariah.


1531
01:18:36.388 --> 01:18:38.139
I was ashamed of myself.

1532
01:18:38.139 --> 01:18:41.347
I still feel ashamed
of myself


1533
01:18:41.347 --> 01:18:46.056
even remembering
that long stretch of my life


1534
01:18:46.056 --> 01:18:49.555
where I didn't want
to be Jewish anymore.


1535
01:18:53.555 --> 01:18:55.513
When I first met Kate,

1536
01:18:55.513 --> 01:18:57.889
something that only happens
in the movies


1537
01:18:57.889 --> 01:18:59.181
happened to me.

1538
01:18:59.181 --> 01:19:04.263
It's a terrible cliché,
but bells began ringing.


1539
01:19:04.263 --> 01:19:07.263
It was love at first sight.
It really was.


1540
01:19:07.263 --> 01:19:08.931
There was something
that was


1541
01:19:08.931 --> 01:19:11.513
so both self-assured
about Katie


1542
01:19:11.513 --> 01:19:13.847
and reassuring for me.

1543
01:19:13.847 --> 01:19:16.597
There was
a kind of in-syncness.


1544
01:19:16.597 --> 01:19:18.680
We could talk
about anything,


1545
01:19:18.680 --> 01:19:20.931
and I couldn't get her
off my mind.


1546
01:19:20.931 --> 01:19:23.222
( choir singing
in Hebrew )


1547
01:19:30.430 --> 01:19:33.472
Spielberg:
Kate came into my world,
in my life,


1548
01:19:33.472 --> 01:19:35.764
with a deep fascination
with the traditions


1549
01:19:35.764 --> 01:19:38.139
and the depth
of the history of Judaism.


1550
01:19:38.139 --> 01:19:40.764
And she really wanted
to marry me as a Jew.


1551
01:19:40.764 --> 01:19:44.014
So, she converted to Judaism
just before we got married.


1552
01:19:44.014 --> 01:19:46.472
Sue: She said
she always felt like
she was coming home.


1553
01:19:46.472 --> 01:19:48.972
She always felt this was
where she was meant to be.


1554
01:19:48.972 --> 01:19:51.680
And so, as she studied Judaism
and got into it,


1555
01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:54.847
it brought Steve back around
to appreciating it.


1556
01:19:54.847 --> 01:19:56.889
Parkes:
Kate brought
something to Steven


1557
01:19:56.889 --> 01:20:00.139
that I don't
think Steven believed
he could ever have.


1558
01:20:00.139 --> 01:20:03.931
She is so dedicated
to the idea of family


1559
01:20:03.931 --> 01:20:07.181
in its, you know,
purest essence


1560
01:20:07.181 --> 01:20:10.056
that not only
did it bring him,


1561
01:20:10.056 --> 01:20:12.805
I think, a happiness
he never thought he'd have,


1562
01:20:12.805 --> 01:20:15.472
but I suspect
it contributed


1563
01:20:15.472 --> 01:20:17.597
to his growth
as an artist.


1564
01:20:25.014 --> 01:20:29.513
( train whistle blaring )

1565
01:20:29.513 --> 01:20:31.889
Spielberg:
In 1982, Sid Sheinberg
gave me the book


1566
01:20:31.889 --> 01:20:33.805
of "Schindler's List"
to read.


1567
01:20:33.805 --> 01:20:36.555
He felt it was my destiny
to make this movie.


1568
01:20:36.555 --> 01:20:38.347
He was tenacious
about getting me


1569
01:20:38.347 --> 01:20:40.972
to pay attention to it,
not to give up on it.


1570
01:20:40.972 --> 01:20:44.764
I think
he was intimidated


1571
01:20:44.764 --> 01:20:48.014
by the thought
of making it.


1572
01:20:48.014 --> 01:20:50.680
Anne:
He had the book
for over 10 years


1573
01:20:50.680 --> 01:20:52.847
before he was ready
to do it.


1574
01:20:52.847 --> 01:20:55.222
And he just said,
"I'll know when it's time."


1575
01:20:55.222 --> 01:20:56.639
You know, if anybody
pushed him on it,


1576
01:20:56.639 --> 01:20:58.097
"I'll know
when it's time."


1577
01:20:58.097 --> 01:20:59.805
- ( people clamoring )
- ( dog barking )


1578
01:20:59.805 --> 01:21:01.347
Anne:
And then the time came.


1579
01:21:07.222 --> 01:21:12.097
Liam Neeson:
On my first day, we were
outside the gates of Auschwitz.


1580
01:21:12.097 --> 01:21:16.222
5:30 in the morning,
bitterly, bitterly cold.


1581
01:21:16.222 --> 01:21:18.597
And hundreds of extras

1582
01:21:18.597 --> 01:21:21.722
dressed up in those
horrible striped pajamas


1583
01:21:21.722 --> 01:21:23.680
and German guards

1584
01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:27.388
and real Alsatian dogs,
real nasty dogs.


1585
01:21:27.388 --> 01:21:30.388
- ( dogs barking )
- ( all screaming )


1586
01:21:31.597 --> 01:21:33.722
No! No!

1587
01:21:33.722 --> 01:21:36.639
Spielberg:
Nothing could prepare me for
my first visit to Auschwitz.


1588
01:21:36.639 --> 01:21:38.222
Nothing prepared me
for that.


1589
01:21:40.639 --> 01:21:43.388
I wanted to shoot
where the story actually
took place,


1590
01:21:43.388 --> 01:21:46.722
all the actual locations,

1591
01:21:46.722 --> 01:21:48.722
but I realized at that point
when I went to Poland


1592
01:21:48.722 --> 01:21:51.347
for the first time
that I was playing with fire.


1593
01:21:51.347 --> 01:21:52.805
That's horrible.

1594
01:21:52.805 --> 01:21:55.388
He was like someone
whose skin had been torn off.


1595
01:21:55.388 --> 01:21:57.680
He was just
so vulnerable,


1596
01:21:57.680 --> 01:22:00.014
pacing up and down
all the time.


1597
01:22:00.014 --> 01:22:01.639
I could tell
how important


1598
01:22:01.639 --> 01:22:04.513
this subject matter
and this film was to him.


1599
01:22:04.513 --> 01:22:06.639
- ( music playing )
- ( chatter )


1600
01:22:13.680 --> 01:22:17.680
Neeson:
He was telling a story
of his family, his tribe,


1601
01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:22.263
so I was aware of the weight
of the subject matter.


1602
01:22:22.263 --> 01:22:24.680
Spielberg:
I said to the crew,
"This isn't a documentary,


1603
01:22:24.680 --> 01:22:28.513
but we are documenting things
that actually took place


1604
01:22:28.513 --> 01:22:30.472
in the place that
you're standing right now."


1605
01:22:30.472 --> 01:22:35.222
And I said also, you know,
"Those of us who are Jewish,


1606
01:22:35.222 --> 01:22:38.805
you know, would never have
been able to stand here,


1607
01:22:38.805 --> 01:22:41.931
you know, in 1943."

1608
01:22:45.972 --> 01:22:48.472
Spielberg:
I knew this couldn't be
just another movie


1609
01:22:48.472 --> 01:22:52.263
and it couldn't be
anything like anything
I had ever directed before.


1610
01:22:52.263 --> 01:22:53.889
I had to approach
the material


1611
01:22:53.889 --> 01:22:55.972
and I had to approach
the location


1612
01:22:55.972 --> 01:22:58.472
with a great deal
of reverence,


1613
01:22:58.472 --> 01:23:03.472
and I had to make this
a very quiet, quiet production.


1614
01:23:03.472 --> 01:23:06.139
We were shooting
on hallowed, sacred ground.


1615
01:23:09.014 --> 01:23:10.597
Everywhere we shot
in Kraków


1616
01:23:10.597 --> 01:23:12.847
felt like we were shooting
in a cemetery.


1617
01:23:12.847 --> 01:23:16.513
And it changed
my entire approach
to cinema.


1618
01:23:16.513 --> 01:23:17.889
I-- that film
looks different


1619
01:23:17.889 --> 01:23:20.181
than anything I had ever
done before that.


1620
01:23:20.181 --> 01:23:23.972
I tried to do it
with no fancy tricks,
no fancy lenses,


1621
01:23:23.972 --> 01:23:26.347
no big Hollywood
sweeping cranes.


1622
01:23:26.347 --> 01:23:28.430
I tried to take
all the tools


1623
01:23:28.430 --> 01:23:30.764
with which I made
so many of my films


1624
01:23:30.764 --> 01:23:32.639
and just chuck them
out the window.


1625
01:23:32.639 --> 01:23:35.347
I never handheld anything,
but I wanted to handhold


1626
01:23:35.347 --> 01:23:37.305
as much of "Schindler's List"
as I possibly could.


1627
01:23:37.305 --> 01:23:39.805
I just wanted to create
for all of us


1628
01:23:39.805 --> 01:23:43.347
the feeling that we were
absolutely there
at the time.


1629
01:23:43.347 --> 01:23:45.347
Goodbye Jews!

1630
01:23:45.347 --> 01:23:48.513
Goodbye Jews!
Goodbye Jews!


1631
01:23:48.513 --> 01:23:51.680
- I'm just wondering
is the synagogue...
- ( coughing )


1632
01:23:51.680 --> 01:23:52.889
...a good background,

1633
01:23:52.889 --> 01:23:54.347
or is the park
a good background,


1634
01:23:54.347 --> 01:23:56.555
because this is
kind of interesting here.


1635
01:23:56.555 --> 01:23:59.056
Ralph Fiennes:
Steven said, "I feel like
I'm directing my first movie.


1636
01:23:59.056 --> 01:24:00.639
I'm not storyboarding
anything."


1637
01:24:00.639 --> 01:24:02.056
And I think that gave him
an adrenaline


1638
01:24:02.056 --> 01:24:03.597
or something
that we all felt.


1639
01:24:03.597 --> 01:24:05.513
A fire, an alertness.

1640
01:24:05.513 --> 01:24:09.347
I've never felt the same level
of energy and focus.


1641
01:24:09.347 --> 01:24:11.889
He seems
to breathe cinema.


1642
01:24:11.889 --> 01:24:14.639
I wouldn't say
he's an intellectual director.


1643
01:24:14.639 --> 01:24:17.931
I think he feels things
intuitively and emotionally.


1644
01:24:17.931 --> 01:24:19.388
...and coverage up
like that.


1645
01:24:19.388 --> 01:24:22.056
He was kind of like
an abstract painter


1646
01:24:22.056 --> 01:24:25.347
who has his canvass

1647
01:24:25.347 --> 01:24:28.889
and has a palette
of extraordinary colors


1648
01:24:28.889 --> 01:24:30.805
but just doesn't know
what color


1649
01:24:30.805 --> 01:24:33.722
to put
on that screen first.


1650
01:24:33.722 --> 01:24:36.139
But once he's committed
to that color,


1651
01:24:36.139 --> 01:24:39.097
he was just firing
on all cylinders.


1652
01:24:39.097 --> 01:24:41.722
And there was
literally times
he was running,


1653
01:24:41.722 --> 01:24:43.472
physically running,
with that camera


1654
01:24:43.472 --> 01:24:45.889
because a lot of the stuff,
he shot himself.


1655
01:24:45.889 --> 01:24:47.139
Handheld camera.

1656
01:24:47.139 --> 01:24:48.764
He'd be running
up and down,


1657
01:24:48.764 --> 01:24:51.097
saying, "Come on,
come with me, quick,"


1658
01:24:51.097 --> 01:24:53.014
as the idea
was forming in his head.


1659
01:24:53.014 --> 01:24:55.513
And we'd all be running
after him, "What? What?"


1660
01:24:55.513 --> 01:24:58.139
He'd be inspired.
He saw something.


1661
01:24:58.139 --> 01:25:00.305
- ( whistle trilling )
- ( people shouting )


1662
01:25:06.931 --> 01:25:10.305
( speaking German )

1663
01:25:10.305 --> 01:25:13.430
Sir Ben Kingsley:
We were all struggling
with the incomprehensible


1664
01:25:13.430 --> 01:25:16.847
as characters
and as actors.


1665
01:25:16.847 --> 01:25:20.722
But we put one foot
in front of the other
in our mandate


1666
01:25:20.722 --> 01:25:23.931
to, as Elie Wiesel says,
tell stories.


1667
01:25:23.931 --> 01:25:26.472
- ( woman screams )
- ( all yelling )


1668
01:25:26.472 --> 01:25:28.222
Kingsley:
We took on the mantle


1669
01:25:28.222 --> 01:25:31.097
of actor-warriors,
if you like.


1670
01:25:31.097 --> 01:25:35.014
Because if you soften
anything with sentiment,


1671
01:25:35.014 --> 01:25:38.222
you lessen the blow that
the audience have got to feel


1672
01:25:38.222 --> 01:25:39.972
and got to reel under.

1673
01:25:39.972 --> 01:25:41.430
( shouting in German )

1674
01:25:46.222 --> 01:25:49.847
( soldiers shouting
in German )


1675
01:25:49.847 --> 01:25:52.680
- ( whistle trills )
- ( speaking German )


1676
01:25:52.680 --> 01:25:55.139
Kingsley:
In the liquidation
of the ghetto scene,


1677
01:25:55.139 --> 01:25:56.805
I knew I had
to serve the story.


1678
01:25:56.805 --> 01:26:00.222
I remembered my lines,
but I was in deep shock.


1679
01:26:00.222 --> 01:26:02.014
- No acting.
- ( shouting )


1680
01:26:02.014 --> 01:26:04.889
- ( gunshot )
- ( woman wailing )


1681
01:26:06.388 --> 01:26:08.014
( whistle trilling )

1682
01:26:08.014 --> 01:26:10.513
Kingsley:
The beautifully
orchestrated chaos


1683
01:26:10.513 --> 01:26:13.014
was unrepeatable
or unforgettable.


1684
01:26:13.014 --> 01:26:15.639
- ( music playing )
- ( chatter )


1685
01:26:20.472 --> 01:26:24.680
Neeson:
Oskar Schindler
was a gregarious man.


1686
01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:27.139
He was
a second-rate businessman.


1687
01:26:27.139 --> 01:26:30.097
Bit of a shady character,
you know?


1688
01:26:30.097 --> 01:26:34.722
A man about town,
loved the women,
loved his booze.


1689
01:26:34.722 --> 01:26:38.347
A bon vivant,
that's what he was.


1690
01:26:38.347 --> 01:26:40.347
And he did
this extraordinary thing.


1691
01:26:40.347 --> 01:26:44.639
He saved
over 1,100 Jewish lives.


1692
01:26:44.639 --> 01:26:47.680
Spielberg:
There was something
indescribably mysterious


1693
01:26:47.680 --> 01:26:49.222
about this character.

1694
01:26:49.222 --> 01:26:51.889
It was impossible
to really understand


1695
01:26:51.889 --> 01:26:54.056
why he did what he did.

1696
01:26:54.056 --> 01:26:56.555
But we decided
just to let the audience


1697
01:26:56.555 --> 01:26:59.388
work that out
for themselves.


1698
01:26:59.388 --> 01:27:01.222
Neeson:
I was a smoker at the time.


1699
01:27:01.222 --> 01:27:03.764
Steve was not a smoker,
but in the close-ups,


1700
01:27:03.764 --> 01:27:05.597
he would start
to tell me how to smoke.


1701
01:27:05.597 --> 01:27:09.056
He'd say, "Okay,
you're looking at the table.


1702
01:27:09.056 --> 01:27:12.931
You see three of these
high-ranking Nazi guys.


1703
01:27:12.931 --> 01:27:14.722
Take a drag
of your cigarette."


1704
01:27:14.722 --> 01:27:18.722
( smacks lips, blows )
"No, no. Do it again.


1705
01:27:18.722 --> 01:27:21.181
Keep your fingers there.
Take a drag.


1706
01:27:21.181 --> 01:27:24.889
Let the smoke
curl up your face.


1707
01:27:24.889 --> 01:27:27.722
Do it again.

1708
01:27:27.722 --> 01:27:30.097
Okay, now take your hand away
very, very slowly."


1709
01:27:30.097 --> 01:27:32.722
So, he was basically
telling me how to breathe.


1710
01:27:32.722 --> 01:27:35.014
I remember sharing it
with Ben Kingsley


1711
01:27:35.014 --> 01:27:36.889
later on that night
or the next day.


1712
01:27:36.889 --> 01:27:40.388
I said, "Ben, I just--
if every scene's gonna
be like that,


1713
01:27:40.388 --> 01:27:42.680
I'm a fucking puppet,
you know?


1714
01:27:42.680 --> 01:27:44.181
I don't want
to be a puppet.


1715
01:27:44.181 --> 01:27:45.639
I'm 41 years of age."

1716
01:27:45.639 --> 01:27:47.472
And I remember
Ben so well.


1717
01:27:47.472 --> 01:27:50.056
He said,
"A great conductor...


1718
01:27:51.597 --> 01:27:54.639
needs a good soloist.

1719
01:27:54.639 --> 01:27:56.263
So just trust that.

1720
01:27:56.263 --> 01:27:57.764
Just go
into his direction.


1721
01:27:57.764 --> 01:27:59.722
Don't fight against it.
Just go into it."


1722
01:27:59.722 --> 01:28:01.097
And that's what I did.

1723
01:28:01.097 --> 01:28:04.430
I just opened myself
for Steven, you know?


1724
01:28:04.430 --> 01:28:05.889
Oskar:
My father
was fond of saying,


1725
01:28:05.889 --> 01:28:08.097
"You need three things
in life--


1726
01:28:08.097 --> 01:28:12.639
a good doctor,
a forgiving priest,


1727
01:28:12.639 --> 01:28:14.597
and a clever accountant."

1728
01:28:18.889 --> 01:28:20.931
The first two...
( chuckles )


1729
01:28:20.931 --> 01:28:22.639
I've never had
much use for.


1730
01:28:22.639 --> 01:28:26.555
But the third?

1731
01:28:26.555 --> 01:28:28.597
Spielberg:
Itzhak Stern
was the character


1732
01:28:28.597 --> 01:28:31.847
that I was closest to
in my understanding of him.


1733
01:28:31.847 --> 01:28:34.639
Just pretend,
for Christ's sake.


1734
01:28:34.639 --> 01:28:38.139
And I said to Ben,
"You're the conscience
of Oskar Schindler.


1735
01:28:38.139 --> 01:28:40.513
You're also my window

1736
01:28:40.513 --> 01:28:42.931
into my insight
into Oskar Schindler."


1737
01:28:42.931 --> 01:28:44.847
I'm trying to thank you.

1738
01:28:46.847 --> 01:28:49.889
I'm saying I couldn't
have done this without you.


1739
01:28:49.889 --> 01:28:52.847
Spielberg:
Anything I can glean
from Schindler himself,


1740
01:28:52.847 --> 01:28:55.513
I think a lot of it is gonna
come from how you look at him.


1741
01:28:58.764 --> 01:29:00.347
You're welcome.

1742
01:29:00.347 --> 01:29:02.014
Kingsley:
There are very,
very few directors


1743
01:29:02.014 --> 01:29:05.097
who respect stillness
as much as Steven.


1744
01:29:05.097 --> 01:29:07.847
He's gonna catch
every single gesture


1745
01:29:07.847 --> 01:29:11.139
you offer to the camera,
and he's going to use it.


1746
01:29:11.139 --> 01:29:16.263
His intuition for
something real and present
is very, very strong.


1747
01:29:16.263 --> 01:29:19.430
He wanted to avoid clichés
about Nazis,


1748
01:29:19.430 --> 01:29:22.889
and, in terms of performance,
I understood it on
my first day.


1749
01:29:22.889 --> 01:29:26.305
You know, the thing
about Amon having a cough--
"Ahem, excuse me,"


1750
01:29:26.305 --> 01:29:29.889
and giving him
sort of banal human failings,
touches like that.


1751
01:29:29.889 --> 01:29:31.931
Man:
Do you have
any questions, sir?


1752
01:29:31.931 --> 01:29:35.805
Yeah, why is the top down?
I'm fucking freezing.


1753
01:29:35.805 --> 01:29:37.764
There were ways in which,
through performance
and filming,


1754
01:29:37.764 --> 01:29:40.222
you can amp up
and signal "bad guy."


1755
01:29:40.222 --> 01:29:42.347
And I think he wanted,
quite rightly,


1756
01:29:42.347 --> 01:29:44.222
to say,
"No, man doing job.


1757
01:29:44.222 --> 01:29:47.139
- You decide
what you think."
- I have an idea.


1758
01:29:47.139 --> 01:29:49.056
How about just
lighting their mouths,
nothing else?


1759
01:29:49.056 --> 01:29:51.222
I was just going--
you know--


1760
01:29:51.222 --> 01:29:53.805
no, him, I want to light
just from the top, you know,


1761
01:29:53.805 --> 01:29:55.972
so we get
some shadows here,
just like...


1762
01:29:55.972 --> 01:29:59.139
Okay, I just want
to make sure we're
not being too on the nose


1763
01:29:59.139 --> 01:30:02.847
with the--
you know, the badness
of the character


1764
01:30:02.847 --> 01:30:05.056
by having
a straight-down light.


1765
01:30:05.056 --> 01:30:07.347
Spielberg: Everything we do
in this medium is about
light and shadow,


1766
01:30:07.347 --> 01:30:10.263
how the cinematographer
lights the actors,
lights the set.


1767
01:30:10.263 --> 01:30:12.097
If you look
at "Schindler's List,"


1768
01:30:12.097 --> 01:30:14.597
Amon Goeth was always
lit beautifully.


1769
01:30:14.597 --> 01:30:16.931
He always had
that beautiful front light.


1770
01:30:16.931 --> 01:30:18.472
You know, the guy
was very clear.


1771
01:30:18.472 --> 01:30:19.889
There was no mystery
in him.


1772
01:30:19.889 --> 01:30:21.597
You don't have
to enhance his evilness,


1773
01:30:21.597 --> 01:30:23.764
if you may say,
by lighting.


1774
01:30:23.764 --> 01:30:25.680
Now, if you look
at Oskar Schindler,


1775
01:30:25.680 --> 01:30:27.263
that was
a confused individual.


1776
01:30:27.263 --> 01:30:29.263
He came to Poland
to make money,


1777
01:30:29.263 --> 01:30:32.388
so it's always glamorous,
but always shadowy.


1778
01:30:32.388 --> 01:30:35.764
And then
as the movie's progressing,
he gets more frontal light.


1779
01:30:35.764 --> 01:30:37.097
The shadows disappear.

1780
01:30:37.097 --> 01:30:39.097
They say you are good.

1781
01:30:39.097 --> 01:30:41.805
Kaminski:
Because he's learning
who he is.


1782
01:30:41.805 --> 01:30:44.722
( man speaking German
over PA )


1783
01:30:47.347 --> 01:30:49.722
- ( distant shouting )
- ( gunshot )


1784
01:30:53.472 --> 01:30:56.472
( children's choir
singing in Yiddish )


1785
01:31:04.555 --> 01:31:07.430
Neeson:
The little girl in red
actually happened.


1786
01:31:07.430 --> 01:31:11.513
Schindler on horseback
watching these people
being rounded up.


1787
01:31:11.513 --> 01:31:13.597
( gunfire )

1788
01:31:13.597 --> 01:31:18.639
Neeson:
He did spot this little girl
in a red coat.


1789
01:31:18.639 --> 01:31:20.805
Of all the carnage
that's happening,


1790
01:31:20.805 --> 01:31:22.931
he can't take his eyes
off this little girl


1791
01:31:22.931 --> 01:31:24.555
meandering
down the street.


1792
01:31:24.555 --> 01:31:25.972
He couldn't take
his eyes off of her


1793
01:31:25.972 --> 01:31:28.347
and wonder why
is she not being taken


1794
01:31:28.347 --> 01:31:30.305
along with
everybody else.


1795
01:31:30.305 --> 01:31:32.764
And, of course,
the answer was,
"Well, she will be taken.


1796
01:31:32.764 --> 01:31:34.305
May not be
in the next few minutes,


1797
01:31:34.305 --> 01:31:36.680
but she's not
going to survive."


1798
01:31:40.014 --> 01:31:41.472
( man shouts in German )

1799
01:31:43.181 --> 01:31:45.181
Spielberg:
During the liquidation
of the ghetto,


1800
01:31:45.181 --> 01:31:47.222
when they were taking people
and putting them in trucks


1801
01:31:47.222 --> 01:31:49.014
and shooting old people
in the streets,


1802
01:31:49.014 --> 01:31:50.972
they were
leaving her alone.


1803
01:31:50.972 --> 01:31:53.513
Somehow,
the most obvious target


1804
01:31:53.513 --> 01:31:55.181
was not being
apprehended.


1805
01:31:55.181 --> 01:31:58.139
And, to me, it was less about
what turned Oskar Schindler,


1806
01:31:58.139 --> 01:32:01.847
and it was more that the world
turned a blind eye
on the Holocaust


1807
01:32:01.847 --> 01:32:05.347
and the industrialized process
of wholesale murder.


1808
01:32:05.347 --> 01:32:07.181
Amon:
Can you believe this?


1809
01:32:07.181 --> 01:32:10.764
As if I don't
have enough to do,
they come up with this?


1810
01:32:10.764 --> 01:32:15.056
I have to find every rag
buried up here and burn it.


1811
01:32:15.056 --> 01:32:17.222
( sighs )
The party's over, Oskar.


1812
01:32:17.222 --> 01:32:19.680
They're closing us down,
sending everybody
to Auschwitz.


1813
01:32:19.680 --> 01:32:20.889
- When?
- I don't know.


1814
01:32:20.889 --> 01:32:22.263
As soon as I can arrange
the shipments.


1815
01:32:22.263 --> 01:32:26.305
Maybe 30, 40 days.
That ought to be fun.


1816
01:32:26.305 --> 01:32:28.972
( man shouting
in German )


1817
01:32:28.972 --> 01:32:30.513
Spielberg:
So, that little girl in red,


1818
01:32:30.513 --> 01:32:32.931
for me, symbolizes
the Holocaust


1819
01:32:32.931 --> 01:32:35.639
and all
of its monstrous evil,


1820
01:32:35.639 --> 01:32:38.347
and no one
did anything about it
when they could have.


1821
01:32:41.931 --> 01:32:46.222
Michael Kahn: I remember
I put together a scene,
very hard, emotionally.


1822
01:32:46.222 --> 01:32:49.222
And Steven comes in
that night.


1823
01:32:49.222 --> 01:32:52.722
We went out to where
he was staying


1824
01:32:52.722 --> 01:32:54.805
and I start running
the scene.


1825
01:32:54.805 --> 01:32:58.181
And he looks at it.
"Hold on, Mike.
I can't do it."


1826
01:32:58.181 --> 01:33:01.222
He's like-- he went like,
"I can't do it.


1827
01:33:01.222 --> 01:33:03.764
It's too tough."
And he left.


1828
01:33:03.764 --> 01:33:06.181
Spielberg:
I just remember getting home
and just falling apart.


1829
01:33:06.181 --> 01:33:08.680
And Kate was on the set
with me a lot.


1830
01:33:08.680 --> 01:33:11.139
We would cry together
many, many times.


1831
01:33:11.139 --> 01:33:14.097
She really kept me going
through that whole production.


1832
01:33:14.097 --> 01:33:17.222
We were
four months in Kraków.
A long time.


1833
01:33:17.222 --> 01:33:20.639
It was, emotionally,
the hardest movie
I've ever made.


1834
01:33:20.639 --> 01:33:22.597
( music playing )

1835
01:33:31.597 --> 01:33:34.097
Annette Insdorf:
The film is not about


1836
01:33:34.097 --> 01:33:37.263
the Holocaust
with a capital "H."


1837
01:33:37.263 --> 01:33:41.972
It is a particular window
into the past.


1838
01:33:50.972 --> 01:33:53.388
And here,
a mainstream director


1839
01:33:53.388 --> 01:33:55.347
had crafted
a motion picture


1840
01:33:55.347 --> 01:33:58.639
that would in fact
finally reach a large audience,


1841
01:33:58.639 --> 01:34:01.222
including people
that simply may never
have known


1842
01:34:01.222 --> 01:34:03.931
the word "Auschwitz."

1843
01:34:03.931 --> 01:34:07.805
( chorus singing
in Hebrew )


1844
01:34:10.972 --> 01:34:12.931
Neeson:
About three quarters
of the way through the shoot,


1845
01:34:12.931 --> 01:34:15.639
Steven had this idea
about the end of the film.


1846
01:34:15.639 --> 01:34:18.847
He wanted to fly us
to Jerusalem.


1847
01:34:18.847 --> 01:34:21.555
We would shoot a scene
at Schindler's grave.


1848
01:34:21.555 --> 01:34:23.222
Spielberg:
I needed there to be


1849
01:34:23.222 --> 01:34:26.513
some testimony
built into the movie


1850
01:34:26.513 --> 01:34:29.805
that says this story
actually happened.


1851
01:34:32.680 --> 01:34:34.513
Fiennes:
Brave thing to do.


1852
01:34:34.513 --> 01:34:35.889
These are
the real people.


1853
01:34:43.056 --> 01:34:45.889
( music playing )

1854
01:35:05.430 --> 01:35:09.388
Kennedy:
That was a pivotal moment
in Steven's life.


1855
01:35:09.388 --> 01:35:11.805
He recognized
he couldn't take


1856
01:35:11.805 --> 01:35:13.597
any of the profits
from the film.


1857
01:35:13.597 --> 01:35:15.639
He wanted to give
something back,


1858
01:35:15.639 --> 01:35:18.555
so he started what became
the Shoah Foundation,


1859
01:35:18.555 --> 01:35:22.555
documenting that oral history
and capturing history


1860
01:35:22.555 --> 01:35:26.722
in a way that allowed people
not to forget.


1861
01:35:26.722 --> 01:35:31.555
Kingsley:
The Shoah Foundation
is a way of trying to hear


1862
01:35:31.555 --> 01:35:35.097
the faintest echo
of the stories that we've lost.


1863
01:35:35.097 --> 01:35:38.097
So, it's connected to him
as a storyteller,


1864
01:35:38.097 --> 01:35:41.388
which is in his DNA.

1865
01:35:41.388 --> 01:35:44.139
Man: They started
running toward the tracks
and they were shot.


1866
01:35:44.139 --> 01:35:46.555
- ( overlapping voices )
- Woman: It was probably
the last patrol of the day.


1867
01:35:46.555 --> 01:35:48.263
They were not supposed
to be there anymore.


1868
01:35:48.263 --> 01:35:50.263
And of course
they asked for papers,


1869
01:35:50.263 --> 01:35:52.764
- but my grandfather
didn't have any.
- ( overlapping voices )


1870
01:35:52.764 --> 01:35:56.263
And they took them.
They took them.


1871
01:35:56.263 --> 01:35:58.555
( overlapping voices
in various languages )


1872
01:35:58.555 --> 01:36:02.513
Neeson:
He's got thousands
and thousands of testimonies,


1873
01:36:02.513 --> 01:36:04.097
and not just
about the Holocaust.


1874
01:36:04.097 --> 01:36:07.430
About Rwanda,
about Bosnia, you know?


1875
01:36:07.430 --> 01:36:10.889
And it's amazing, this legacy
that "Schindler's List"


1876
01:36:10.889 --> 01:36:12.805
has spawned
through Steven.


1877
01:36:12.805 --> 01:36:14.764
( music playing )

1878
01:36:30.430 --> 01:36:32.931
Spielberg:
The experience of making
"Schindler's List"


1879
01:36:32.931 --> 01:36:37.222
made me reconcile
with all of the reasons,


1880
01:36:37.222 --> 01:36:43.097
the vain, glorious reasons,
I hid from my Jewishness.


1881
01:36:43.097 --> 01:36:47.639
And it made me so proud
to be a Jew.


1882
01:36:57.222 --> 01:36:59.263
- ( trees rustling )
- ( bird squawks )


1883
01:37:01.639 --> 01:37:03.597
( dinosaur growling )

1884
01:37:07.639 --> 01:37:10.847
Kennedy:
There are periods of time
in moviemaking history


1885
01:37:10.847 --> 01:37:14.139
where you have
a collision of events


1886
01:37:14.139 --> 01:37:16.014
that innovates and creates
something new.


1887
01:37:16.014 --> 01:37:19.014
And "Jurassic Park"
was one of those moments.


1888
01:37:19.014 --> 01:37:21.097
- Man: Keep it there.
- Spielberg: It was
the beginning


1889
01:37:21.097 --> 01:37:22.847
of, really,
the digital era


1890
01:37:22.847 --> 01:37:26.388
where the central characters
were digitally created.


1891
01:37:26.388 --> 01:37:28.513
No one had ever
gone there before that way.


1892
01:37:28.513 --> 01:37:32.181
- Man #2: Come on!
- ( all chattering )


1893
01:37:32.181 --> 01:37:34.263
Kennedy:
Steven said to me,


1894
01:37:34.263 --> 01:37:38.847
"I want 28-foot to 30-foot
dinosaurs on the set


1895
01:37:38.847 --> 01:37:41.014
that the actors
can interact with,


1896
01:37:41.014 --> 01:37:43.263
and I want them
to be able to run."


1897
01:37:43.263 --> 01:37:45.931
There were going to be
at least 60 wide shots


1898
01:37:45.931 --> 01:37:47.889
with 60 head-to-toe
dinosaurs


1899
01:37:47.889 --> 01:37:49.847
that could not
operate mechanically.


1900
01:37:49.847 --> 01:37:51.388
They had to run.
They had to perform.


1901
01:37:51.388 --> 01:37:52.931
They had to twist and turn.
They had to be real.


1902
01:37:52.931 --> 01:37:56.805
So, I went off to start
to talk to experts


1903
01:37:56.805 --> 01:38:00.305
in the area of prosthetics
and theme parks


1904
01:38:00.305 --> 01:38:01.597
to figure out
how we're gonna do this.


1905
01:38:01.597 --> 01:38:03.139
And, of course,
everybody said to me,


1906
01:38:03.139 --> 01:38:05.347
"We can build these things,
but they can't run."


1907
01:38:05.347 --> 01:38:07.263
So, I went back to Steven
and I said, "They can't run."


1908
01:38:07.263 --> 01:38:08.972
He said, "Well,
they have to run."


1909
01:38:08.972 --> 01:38:11.263
- Okay, pushing team,
move in there.
- Man: Move in.


1910
01:38:11.263 --> 01:38:14.597
Kennedy:
So, all this development
was going on,


1911
01:38:14.597 --> 01:38:19.388
and simultaneous to that,
Dennis Muren called me
and he said,


1912
01:38:19.388 --> 01:38:22.388
"I'm working on something
with the computer


1913
01:38:22.388 --> 01:38:24.722
that I think could be
extraordinary."


1914
01:38:24.722 --> 01:38:26.680
( dinosaur roaring )

1915
01:38:26.680 --> 01:38:28.388
( grunts )

1916
01:38:28.388 --> 01:38:29.722
( groaning )

1917
01:38:29.722 --> 01:38:31.181
( alarm blaring )

1918
01:38:31.181 --> 01:38:32.931
- Aah!
- ( dinosaur roars )


1919
01:38:32.931 --> 01:38:34.555
Muldoon:
Lock the opening!


1920
01:38:34.555 --> 01:38:36.597
Marshall:
And we flew up to ILM,


1921
01:38:36.597 --> 01:38:38.305
and we went
in this little office,


1922
01:38:38.305 --> 01:38:41.597
and there was a computer,
and Dennis said, "Watch this."


1923
01:38:41.597 --> 01:38:42.972
And he hit a button,

1924
01:38:42.972 --> 01:38:45.263
and there was
a dinosaur running.


1925
01:38:45.263 --> 01:38:46.555
This is all in the computer.

1926
01:38:46.555 --> 01:38:47.847
There's no models,
no cameras, or anything.


1927
01:38:47.847 --> 01:38:49.263
When we looked at them,

1928
01:38:49.263 --> 01:38:50.889
it was like nothing
you had ever seen before.


1929
01:38:50.889 --> 01:38:54.181
And it was one
of those primal moments


1930
01:38:54.181 --> 01:38:58.097
- where you suddenly
realize, oh, my God...
- Oh, my God.


1931
01:38:58.097 --> 01:38:59.555
Oh, my God,
we're there.


1932
01:38:59.555 --> 01:39:01.847
Spielberg:
This is the future.


1933
01:39:01.847 --> 01:39:03.805
I could not
believe my eyes.


1934
01:39:03.805 --> 01:39:05.805
Couldn't believe it.

1935
01:39:05.805 --> 01:39:07.680
They were alive.
They were real.


1936
01:39:07.680 --> 01:39:11.097
And it was so exciting,
we all leapt to our feet


1937
01:39:11.097 --> 01:39:13.430
because we had never seen
anything like it.


1938
01:39:13.430 --> 01:39:15.139
I'm not exaggerating
when I say


1939
01:39:15.139 --> 01:39:18.847
looking at that test
was like the moment


1940
01:39:18.847 --> 01:39:20.388
when sound came to movies.

1941
01:39:20.388 --> 01:39:23.972
There was this new tool
that was going to be huge,


1942
01:39:23.972 --> 01:39:25.181
and you could just tell.

1943
01:39:25.181 --> 01:39:27.139
( music playing )

1944
01:39:29.722 --> 01:39:32.305
( roaring )

1945
01:39:38.722 --> 01:39:41.139
Laura Dern:
It was that much
of an experiment.


1946
01:39:41.139 --> 01:39:42.931
It felt that wild.

1947
01:39:42.931 --> 01:39:46.056
And watching, you know,
their brains at work


1948
01:39:46.056 --> 01:39:48.764
as we were shooting,
and how'd they adjust a shot,


1949
01:39:48.764 --> 01:39:51.139
and how giddy
Steven would get,


1950
01:39:51.139 --> 01:39:55.680
you get caught up
in the dreams he was building
and the magic.


1951
01:39:55.680 --> 01:39:58.764
Jeff Goldblum: During
the scenes where we're
first seeing the dinosaur,


1952
01:39:58.764 --> 01:40:00.181
he puts the camera on me
and says, "Okay, Jeff,


1953
01:40:00.181 --> 01:40:01.805
now you're looking
at the thing.


1954
01:40:01.805 --> 01:40:03.472
Okay, so look at it.

1955
01:40:03.472 --> 01:40:05.555
Yeah, keep going.
Keep rolling.


1956
01:40:05.555 --> 01:40:07.931
Is it real?
Is it a trick?


1957
01:40:07.931 --> 01:40:11.263
And now,
for no reason at all,
you start to laugh.


1958
01:40:11.263 --> 01:40:12.680
Keep laughing
a little bit.


1959
01:40:12.680 --> 01:40:14.597
Laugh a little bit more.
That's it.


1960
01:40:14.597 --> 01:40:16.805
Now you're stunned
by it again


1961
01:40:16.805 --> 01:40:18.472
and you just get
very still.


1962
01:40:20.014 --> 01:40:21.555
Okay, that's it.
Okay, I got what I need.


1963
01:40:21.555 --> 01:40:23.347
Let's go.
Let's move on."
Like that.


1964
01:40:23.347 --> 01:40:25.181
He knows exactly
what he needs.


1965
01:40:25.181 --> 01:40:27.056
Weapon, you know,
guy face-- all faces,


1966
01:40:27.056 --> 01:40:30.181
weapons, faces,
and then right to Bob.


1967
01:40:30.181 --> 01:40:33.680
- Get in there!
- Spielberg: "Jurassic Park"
is a cautionary tale.


1968
01:40:33.680 --> 01:40:35.889
We stand on the shoulders
of giants


1969
01:40:35.889 --> 01:40:38.764
to create
the next great thing,


1970
01:40:38.764 --> 01:40:42.430
and yet we take
no responsibility
for our own creations.


1971
01:40:42.430 --> 01:40:45.764
But it's an old, timeworn
science fiction story.


1972
01:40:45.764 --> 01:40:48.263
It's what brought Godzilla
up from the depths.


1973
01:40:48.263 --> 01:40:52.805
You mess
with atomic energy,
you get Godzilla.


1974
01:40:52.805 --> 01:40:55.305
Rick Carter:
There's a lot of dark themes
in "Jurassic Park"


1975
01:40:55.305 --> 01:40:58.805
that are about, you know,
unleashing Pandora's box.


1976
01:40:58.805 --> 01:41:01.889
As it turns out, it's not
only genetic engineering,


1977
01:41:01.889 --> 01:41:04.222
which is a theme
in the movie,


1978
01:41:04.222 --> 01:41:06.056
it's actually
the digital revolution


1979
01:41:06.056 --> 01:41:08.305
coming out right
from behind the fence.


1980
01:41:08.305 --> 01:41:11.263
- ( growling )
- ( thunder crashing )


1981
01:41:18.347 --> 01:41:20.181
( roaring )

1982
01:41:20.181 --> 01:41:22.764
Muren: This opened up
a whole new world
in storytelling


1983
01:41:22.764 --> 01:41:25.056
because you can do
anything you want.


1984
01:41:25.056 --> 01:41:27.639
You're not limited
by plastics or metal


1985
01:41:27.639 --> 01:41:30.430
or gravity
or anything.


1986
01:41:30.430 --> 01:41:32.764
If you can imagine it,
you can do it.


1987
01:41:32.764 --> 01:41:35.597
It was the end of an era,
no question about it.


1988
01:41:35.597 --> 01:41:37.430
And it was the beginning
of a whole nother era.


1989
01:41:37.430 --> 01:41:40.430
- ( music playing )
- ( chittering )


1990
01:41:50.931 --> 01:41:55.472
Muren: Steven is a master
of putting the effects shots in
for a purpose.


1991
01:41:55.472 --> 01:41:59.181
They're there
to advance the story


1992
01:41:59.181 --> 01:42:02.139
and to make it
a different journey


1993
01:42:02.139 --> 01:42:04.305
than anybody's
seen before.


1994
01:42:04.305 --> 01:42:05.972
And it could be
a spaceship,


1995
01:42:05.972 --> 01:42:08.513
it could be a dinosaur,
it could be an alien landing,


1996
01:42:08.513 --> 01:42:12.305
it could be,
you know, a red coat
that somebody's wearing


1997
01:42:12.305 --> 01:42:14.722
when they're running through
a black-and-white movie.


1998
01:42:14.722 --> 01:42:17.639
- Put the camera down.
- Parkes: It's part
of the emotional landscape


1999
01:42:17.639 --> 01:42:19.388
of the story he's telling.

2000
01:42:19.388 --> 01:42:21.472
I've never seen
a single moment


2001
01:42:21.472 --> 01:42:23.472
in a Spielberg movie
in which you feel


2002
01:42:23.472 --> 01:42:25.931
that the technology
is crushing the story.


2003
01:42:25.931 --> 01:42:27.722
And that's really hard.

2004
01:42:27.722 --> 01:42:30.639
I mean, these moments,
which have to feel


2005
01:42:30.639 --> 01:42:33.972
spontaneous and real
on-screen...


2006
01:42:33.972 --> 01:42:35.931
There are

2007
01:42:35.931 --> 01:42:37.972
and half of it is being
created six months later


2008
01:42:37.972 --> 01:42:41.680
and half of it
was six months before.


2009
01:42:41.680 --> 01:42:43.430
Koepp:
When he made
"Jurassic Park,"


2010
01:42:43.430 --> 01:42:45.181
there was no guarantee
that it would work.


2011
01:42:45.181 --> 01:42:47.972
That could easily
have been a disaster.


2012
01:42:47.972 --> 01:42:52.639
But it was the right ratio
of excitement and fear
for Steven.


2013
01:42:52.639 --> 01:42:55.305
Doing a movie
has to scare you
a little bit.


2014
01:42:55.305 --> 01:42:58.347
Otherwise,
you're not pushing it.


2015
01:42:58.347 --> 01:43:00.014
"Schindler's List,"
which seems--


2016
01:43:00.014 --> 01:43:02.097
clearly, that should have
been a movie now--


2017
01:43:02.097 --> 01:43:05.513
was a three-hour
black-and-white movie
about the Holocaust.


2018
01:43:05.513 --> 01:43:11.056
In the halls of Universal,
that was-- that was crazy.


2019
01:43:11.056 --> 01:43:12.722
That was not--

2020
01:43:12.722 --> 01:43:15.764
who green lights
that movie, you know?


2021
01:43:15.764 --> 01:43:20.263
It was as big a risk
as CG dinosaurs.
Bigger.


2022
01:43:20.263 --> 01:43:23.388
You're saying
"All my credibility
as a fantasy filmmaker--


2023
01:43:23.388 --> 01:43:26.472
I'm gonna risk all that
on CG dinosaurs.


2024
01:43:26.472 --> 01:43:28.931
And all my credibility
as an artist,


2025
01:43:28.931 --> 01:43:30.639
I'm gonna put
on the line, too.


2026
01:43:30.639 --> 01:43:33.222
And I'm gonna do it all
over the course of 12 months.


2027
01:43:33.222 --> 01:43:35.388
Fingers crossed."

2028
01:43:35.388 --> 01:43:36.889
They seem obvious now.

2029
01:43:36.889 --> 01:43:40.347
They were by no means
guarantees.


2030
01:43:40.347 --> 01:43:43.722
And that must have been
a really terrifying period,


2031
01:43:43.722 --> 01:43:46.889
because you really are
pushing all your chips
into the middle of the table


2032
01:43:46.889 --> 01:43:48.764
at that point.

2033
01:43:48.764 --> 01:43:50.555
Of course, it turned out
very well for Steven,


2034
01:43:50.555 --> 01:43:52.722
giving him
one of the strangest


2035
01:43:52.722 --> 01:43:56.181
and most astoundingly
successful years of any
film director, ever.


2036
01:43:56.181 --> 01:43:59.139
The Brain:
This is my greatest
technological masterpiece--


2037
01:43:59.139 --> 01:44:01.889
the Schpiel
-Borg 2000.

2038
01:44:01.889 --> 01:44:03.889
I spared no expense.

2039
01:44:03.889 --> 01:44:05.513
Your play pal, Pinky,

2040
01:44:05.513 --> 01:44:08.889
is actually
an extremely advanced
cybernetic clone


2041
01:44:08.889 --> 01:44:12.139
of one of Hollywood's
most powerful figures.


2042
01:44:12.139 --> 01:44:15.097
And if his box office numbers
are any indication,


2043
01:44:15.097 --> 01:44:19.305
he has the potential
to become ruler of the world.


2044
01:44:19.305 --> 01:44:22.513
Steven is the best-known
director in the world, easily.


2045
01:44:22.513 --> 01:44:24.139
( thumps )

2046
01:44:24.139 --> 01:44:26.722
- Listen.
- What?


2047
01:44:28.764 --> 01:44:30.430
( thunder crashes )

2048
01:44:30.430 --> 01:44:32.097
( both screaming )

2049
01:44:32.097 --> 01:44:34.181
Steven, you've made
so many films.


2050
01:44:34.181 --> 01:44:36.889
When are you
gonna do the big one?


2051
01:44:36.889 --> 01:44:39.555
( laughing ) Wow.
What do you mean "big one?"


2052
01:44:39.555 --> 01:44:41.430
Something that clicks
with the public.


2053
01:44:41.430 --> 01:44:42.764
"Something that clicks
with the public."


2054
01:44:42.764 --> 01:44:45.305
( reporters clamoring )

2055
01:44:45.305 --> 01:44:47.472
The guy's
an unmistakable force


2056
01:44:47.472 --> 01:44:49.347
in the business
of making movies.


2057
01:44:49.347 --> 01:44:51.513
Running a company,
being an executive producer,


2058
01:44:51.513 --> 01:44:53.472
being a producer,
and being a director.


2059
01:44:53.472 --> 01:44:57.305
Robert Zemeckis:
For a filmmaker, you can't
have a better producer


2060
01:44:57.305 --> 01:44:59.305
than one of the greatest
directors in the world.


2061
01:44:59.305 --> 01:45:02.639
He really nurtures
young talent coming up.


2062
01:45:02.639 --> 01:45:05.139
It's a pretty amazing
roster.


2063
01:45:07.889 --> 01:45:10.555
He's also a major figure
in the television business.


2064
01:45:10.555 --> 01:45:11.972
He started a restaurant.

2065
01:45:11.972 --> 01:45:14.263
Dive!
Submarine sandwiches.


2066
01:45:14.263 --> 01:45:16.639
The man was, like, doing

2067
01:45:16.639 --> 01:45:19.931
and being perfectly
unselfconscious about it.


2068
01:45:19.931 --> 01:45:22.472
How many hats
does that man wear?
It's impossible.


2069
01:45:22.472 --> 01:45:24.181
Parkes:
He once told me,
"When I'm at a buffet,


2070
01:45:24.181 --> 01:45:27.388
I like to have
too much food
on my plate."


2071
01:45:27.388 --> 01:45:29.680
( music playing )

2072
01:45:29.680 --> 01:45:32.222
Holly Hunter:
He will be in production
on a movie,


2073
01:45:32.222 --> 01:45:34.388
doing preproduction
for another movie,


2074
01:45:34.388 --> 01:45:36.056
and editing yet a third.

2075
01:45:36.056 --> 01:45:38.014
He's got a lot
of different channels.


2076
01:45:38.014 --> 01:45:39.263
You know, me,
I have a list.


2077
01:45:39.263 --> 01:45:40.513
You know,
"change light bulbs,"


2078
01:45:40.513 --> 01:45:42.139
and that's on there
for a week.


2079
01:45:42.139 --> 01:45:44.263
No, he gets
a lot accomplished.


2080
01:45:44.263 --> 01:45:47.388
Tom Brokaw:
Three of Hollywood's richest,
most powerful boy wonders


2081
01:45:47.388 --> 01:45:50.181
teamed up today to create
a movie studio,


2082
01:45:50.181 --> 01:45:53.305
Hollywood's first
major new independent studio


2083
01:45:53.305 --> 01:45:54.347
in almost half a century.

2084
01:45:56.388 --> 01:45:58.472
Geffen:
I don't think Steven
really fears anything.


2085
01:45:58.472 --> 01:46:01.222
He's always ready to go
and do something new.


2086
01:46:03.222 --> 01:46:06.430
Jeffrey Katzenberg:
No one can consume
information,


2087
01:46:06.430 --> 01:46:09.305
be in so many places
so effortlessly.


2088
01:46:09.305 --> 01:46:12.430
It used to make me crazy
if a screenplay came in,


2089
01:46:12.430 --> 01:46:14.555
that, you know,
we were all waiting for,


2090
01:46:14.555 --> 01:46:16.722
no matter what,
I could never get home


2091
01:46:16.722 --> 01:46:18.764
and get it read
before him.


2092
01:46:20.388 --> 01:46:22.513
Dustin Hoffman:
To be that talented,


2093
01:46:22.513 --> 01:46:27.513
to be that successful
almost in a mythological way,


2094
01:46:27.513 --> 01:46:29.222
your jaw drops.

2095
01:46:29.222 --> 01:46:30.680
Many times
you see the person


2096
01:46:30.680 --> 01:46:35.263
incorporating their success
into their personality.


2097
01:46:35.263 --> 01:46:39.014
There's a sense
of self-importance.


2098
01:46:39.014 --> 01:46:41.597
And it's the opposite
with Steven.


2099
01:46:41.597 --> 01:46:45.056
Steven's like a guy who works
for Steven Spielberg.


2100
01:46:46.889 --> 01:46:49.014
- ( water splashing )
- ( children laughing )


2101
01:46:49.014 --> 01:46:52.597
- ( Spielberg vocalizing
"Jaws" theme )
- Girl: Shark!


2102
01:46:52.597 --> 01:46:54.764
Spielberg:
A day of pure bliss,
for me,


2103
01:46:54.764 --> 01:46:56.722
is a day where
I'm with my family.


2104
01:46:56.722 --> 01:46:59.889
I've got my eyes closed,
they're swimming in the pool,


2105
01:46:59.889 --> 01:47:01.972
- and I just
listen to their voices.
- Spielberg: One more time.


2106
01:47:01.972 --> 01:47:04.347
That's great, Theo.
That was the best one.


2107
01:47:04.347 --> 01:47:06.513
Spielberg:
I never knew I was going
to have a big family.


2108
01:47:06.513 --> 01:47:08.263
That took me
completely by surprise.


2109
01:47:08.263 --> 01:47:10.513
Kate never thought she'd have
a big family either.


2110
01:47:10.513 --> 01:47:14.889
So, the natural evolution
in our life was a gift.


2111
01:47:14.889 --> 01:47:16.764
- ( girl yelps )
- Spielberg: Jessica
is my oldest,


2112
01:47:16.764 --> 01:47:19.513
and then Max,
and then Theo after that,


2113
01:47:19.513 --> 01:47:22.513
and then Sasha,
and then Sawyer,


2114
01:47:22.513 --> 01:47:24.889
and then Mikaela,
and then Destry.


2115
01:47:24.889 --> 01:47:26.764
- Woman: Whoo-hoo!
- ( squeals )


2116
01:47:26.764 --> 01:47:29.597
Spielberg:
Kate is a force
in my life.


2117
01:47:29.597 --> 01:47:31.181
There's such an honesty
about her


2118
01:47:31.181 --> 01:47:32.847
and an awareness
of the world.


2119
01:47:32.847 --> 01:47:34.472
And I think
the authenticity


2120
01:47:34.472 --> 01:47:37.722
of the kinds of movies
I began to make


2121
01:47:37.722 --> 01:47:40.889
after Katie and I
got together


2122
01:47:40.889 --> 01:47:44.597
had to do with bringing
a kind of truth into my life


2123
01:47:44.597 --> 01:47:48.097
where truth began
to upstage make-believe.


2124
01:47:48.097 --> 01:47:49.555
Spielberg:
Okay, turn the camera on.


2125
01:47:49.555 --> 01:47:51.805
- Roll.
- Man: Okay, do it.


2126
01:47:51.805 --> 01:47:53.472
Marker.

2127
01:47:53.472 --> 01:47:55.056
Spielberg:
You know, I've turned down


2128
01:47:55.056 --> 01:47:58.513
a lot of very successful
movie franchises


2129
01:47:58.513 --> 01:48:01.722
that 10 years before I would've
jumped at the chance to direct.


2130
01:48:01.722 --> 01:48:03.805
But it wasn't
the kind of legacy


2131
01:48:03.805 --> 01:48:06.305
I want to leave behind
for my kids.


2132
01:48:27.722 --> 01:48:29.847
Hanks:
Steven wanted
"Saving Private Ryan"


2133
01:48:29.847 --> 01:48:34.388
to be a different
kind of very tactile
and personal war movie.


2134
01:48:34.388 --> 01:48:36.347
We had no idea
that Omaha Beach


2135
01:48:36.347 --> 01:48:40.097
was gonna be what it was like
when we started.


2136
01:48:40.097 --> 01:48:42.430
He did not describe
anything to us.


2137
01:48:42.430 --> 01:48:44.347
He was playing
with our sense of confusion


2138
01:48:44.347 --> 01:48:45.972
and panic and fear,

2139
01:48:45.972 --> 01:48:48.222
capturing the moment
of our own shock,


2140
01:48:48.222 --> 01:48:51.513
or our surprise,
or our own blankness.


2141
01:48:51.513 --> 01:48:53.847
And the difference
between standing around
before we're shooting


2142
01:48:53.847 --> 01:48:56.097
and saying,
"Hey, ready to do this?
Nice to meet you. Here we go.


2143
01:48:56.097 --> 01:48:57.722
Can you swim?
You can't swim?


2144
01:48:57.722 --> 01:49:00.388
You better, because you're
in a Steven Spielberg movie.


2145
01:49:00.388 --> 01:49:03.805
You better..."
So, we're talking like that.


2146
01:49:03.805 --> 01:49:05.597
And then it opened up

2147
01:49:05.597 --> 01:49:09.931
and all the powers
of physical moviemaking
went berserk.


2148
01:49:09.931 --> 01:49:12.056
- ( loud whirring )
- ( men shouting )


2149
01:49:12.056 --> 01:49:14.805
( rapid gunfire )

2150
01:49:14.805 --> 01:49:16.722
( explosion )

2151
01:49:21.972 --> 01:49:23.722
( rapid gunfire )

2152
01:49:28.430 --> 01:49:30.263
Over the side!

2153
01:49:30.263 --> 01:49:32.222
( gunfire continues )

2154
01:49:36.472 --> 01:49:38.597
- ( bullets whizzing )
- Over the side, boys!


2155
01:49:47.222 --> 01:49:49.513
( bullets whizzing )

2156
01:49:49.513 --> 01:49:51.931
Spielberg:
I tried very, very hard
to put the audience


2157
01:49:51.931 --> 01:49:56.014
as close to the experience
as I possibly knew how to do


2158
01:49:56.014 --> 01:49:58.931
so there wouldn't ever be
a safe feeling


2159
01:49:58.931 --> 01:50:00.555
in the audience.

2160
01:50:00.555 --> 01:50:02.263
And when you narrow
that distance--


2161
01:50:02.263 --> 01:50:04.764
if you're successful
in narrowing the distance,


2162
01:50:04.764 --> 01:50:08.555
then the audience
really becomes those characters.


2163
01:50:08.555 --> 01:50:09.430
( rapid gunfire )

2164
01:50:10.555 --> 01:50:11.430
( rapid gunfire )

2165
01:50:15.014 --> 01:50:16.097
( rapid gunfire )

2166
01:50:17.222 --> 01:50:19.639
Come on.

2167
01:50:19.639 --> 01:50:22.805
Edelstein:
In "Saving  Private Ryan,"
Spielberg understood


2168
01:50:22.805 --> 01:50:25.722
the expressionistic
possibilities of sound.


2169
01:50:25.722 --> 01:50:28.181
- ( bullets whizzing )
- ( men shouting )


2170
01:50:28.181 --> 01:50:30.889
Edelstein:
You could hear the bullets
streaking along.


2171
01:50:30.889 --> 01:50:33.388
You can hear them
penetrate the flesh


2172
01:50:33.388 --> 01:50:35.388
and ravage these bodies.

2173
01:50:35.388 --> 01:50:38.097
You felt what it was like
to have your ears ringing


2174
01:50:38.097 --> 01:50:41.305
in the midst of this
and be completely disoriented.


2175
01:50:41.305 --> 01:50:43.347
( explosion )

2176
01:50:43.347 --> 01:50:45.347
( sound fades )

2177
01:50:48.722 --> 01:50:51.097
Edelstein:
The sheer intensity
of that scene,


2178
01:50:51.097 --> 01:50:52.847
the visceral element,

2179
01:50:52.847 --> 01:50:55.472
not just metaphorically,
but literally,


2180
01:50:55.472 --> 01:50:58.972
is like nothing-- nothing
that had been put
on film before.


2181
01:51:02.388 --> 01:51:05.347
( rapid gunfire )

2182
01:51:05.347 --> 01:51:08.513
Spielberg:
I decided to shoot the entire
Omaha Beach sequence


2183
01:51:08.513 --> 01:51:10.347
in complete continuity,

2184
01:51:10.347 --> 01:51:13.014
not knowing
what was gonna come next.


2185
01:51:13.014 --> 01:51:15.513
And all my cameramen
were given instruction


2186
01:51:15.513 --> 01:51:18.889
to be spontaneous
in what they decided to shoot,


2187
01:51:18.889 --> 01:51:21.139
just like a documentary
cameraman would.


2188
01:51:21.139 --> 01:51:24.805
And for, like, 27 days,
we literally took the beach


2189
01:51:24.805 --> 01:51:27.639
as filmmakers,
one yard at a time.


2190
01:51:27.639 --> 01:51:29.181
- ( gunfire )
- ( men shouting )


2191
01:51:31.388 --> 01:51:35.181
Mama! Mama!

2192
01:51:35.181 --> 01:51:37.222
Maslin:
"Saving Private Ryan"
revealed


2193
01:51:37.222 --> 01:51:39.847
certain visceral truths
about war


2194
01:51:39.847 --> 01:51:42.305
that people were not
gonna learn from books.


2195
01:51:42.305 --> 01:51:44.889
They were not gonna learn
from documentaries.


2196
01:51:44.889 --> 01:51:47.097
That was him
at the height of his powers


2197
01:51:47.097 --> 01:51:49.305
doing something
that nobody else could do.


2198
01:51:49.305 --> 01:51:52.472
- ( gunfire )
- Hanks: The first time
we talked about the movie,


2199
01:51:52.472 --> 01:51:56.513
he said, "I can't wait
to shoot that machine gun nest
at the radar installation."


2200
01:51:56.513 --> 01:51:58.555
He had already mapped
this thing out in his mind,


2201
01:51:58.555 --> 01:52:01.639
and when we got
to the location,
there was one problem--


2202
01:52:01.639 --> 01:52:03.597
the sun wasn't
in the right place.


2203
01:52:03.597 --> 01:52:07.181
Steven had thought
the set was built this way,


2204
01:52:07.181 --> 01:52:08.889
but it was built
this way.


2205
01:52:08.889 --> 01:52:10.805
So, he could not shoot it,
because the sun


2206
01:52:10.805 --> 01:52:12.889
was not going to give him
the light that he wanted.


2207
01:52:12.889 --> 01:52:16.181
And he was mad,
perhaps with himself
or perhaps with someone


2208
01:52:16.181 --> 01:52:18.513
who didn't tell him
what the compass points were.


2209
01:52:18.513 --> 01:52:20.764
So, he went on a walk,
and when he comes back,


2210
01:52:20.764 --> 01:52:22.388
he says, "Okay, I know
how I'm gonna shoot it."


2211
01:52:22.388 --> 01:52:25.555
- ( panting )
- ( rapid gunfire )


2212
01:52:25.555 --> 01:52:27.597
And it's a different
perspective


2213
01:52:27.597 --> 01:52:30.597
from any other assault
that we had shot in the film.


2214
01:52:30.597 --> 01:52:32.097
( explosion )

2215
01:52:32.097 --> 01:52:34.597
And if you're not Steven,

2216
01:52:34.597 --> 01:52:36.597
if you don't have
this lifetime


2217
01:52:36.597 --> 01:52:39.597
of cinematic language
in your head,


2218
01:52:39.597 --> 01:52:41.597
that's a different
kind of day.


2219
01:52:41.597 --> 01:52:45.263
But because his eye
is so connected to his brain


2220
01:52:45.263 --> 01:52:47.222
and every movie
that he's ever seen


2221
01:52:47.222 --> 01:52:48.764
and every movie
that he's ever made,


2222
01:52:48.764 --> 01:52:50.097
he just went out
and said,


2223
01:52:50.097 --> 01:52:52.513
"Here's how we're gonna
do this, and that's it."


2224
01:52:52.513 --> 01:52:53.931
Incredible.

2225
01:52:53.931 --> 01:52:55.931
( music playing )

2226
01:53:03.430 --> 01:53:06.931
Anne:
"Saving Private Ryan"
was in honor of the veterans,


2227
01:53:06.931 --> 01:53:10.222
and I think a bit of a homage
to my father


2228
01:53:10.222 --> 01:53:12.472
who flew missions
during WWII.


2229
01:53:12.472 --> 01:53:15.972
He wasn't in Europe.
He was in India and Burma.


2230
01:53:15.972 --> 01:53:19.097
When I was a kid,
my dad was telling
WWII stories all the time.


2231
01:53:19.097 --> 01:53:21.139
His veteran friends
would come over to the house


2232
01:53:21.139 --> 01:53:22.639
and I'd listen to them
tell war stories.


2233
01:53:22.639 --> 01:53:24.513
So, WWII,
that greatest generation,


2234
01:53:24.513 --> 01:53:29.056
became something that I wished
I could be part of.


2235
01:53:29.056 --> 01:53:31.597
Lucas: Steven had
a complicated relationship
with his father,


2236
01:53:31.597 --> 01:53:35.472
but he was starting
to reconnect and realize


2237
01:53:35.472 --> 01:53:38.305
that his first impressions
of a lot of the things he had


2238
01:53:38.305 --> 01:53:39.847
weren't necessarily true.

2239
01:53:39.847 --> 01:53:41.805
It was complex for me
for a long time,


2240
01:53:41.805 --> 01:53:45.347
but at least
I had a art form


2241
01:53:45.347 --> 01:53:48.181
that I could
filter it through.


2242
01:53:48.181 --> 01:53:49.513
At least I had that.

2243
01:53:49.513 --> 01:53:53.263
If movies did
anything for me, it--


2244
01:53:53.263 --> 01:53:57.513
I've avoided therapy
because movies are my therapy.


2245
01:54:00.722 --> 01:54:02.764
Junior?

2246
01:54:02.764 --> 01:54:05.430
- Yes, sir.
- Spielberg: And this
father-son obsession


2247
01:54:05.430 --> 01:54:07.305
I've had in my movies
obviously speaks


2248
01:54:07.305 --> 01:54:13.347
to a great deal of feelings
that I've been carrying with me


2249
01:54:13.347 --> 01:54:16.056
that I want
to unburden myself of,
and I have.


2250
01:54:16.056 --> 01:54:19.181
Do you remember
the last time we had
a quiet drink?


2251
01:54:19.181 --> 01:54:21.430
Huh?

2252
01:54:21.430 --> 01:54:23.764
I had a milkshake.

2253
01:54:23.764 --> 01:54:25.931
Hmm? What did
we talk about?


2254
01:54:25.931 --> 01:54:27.889
- ( music playing )
- ( chatter )


2255
01:54:27.889 --> 01:54:30.430
We didn't talk.

2256
01:54:30.430 --> 01:54:32.181
We never talked.

2257
01:54:32.181 --> 01:54:33.639
Maslin:
The absent father


2258
01:54:33.639 --> 01:54:35.639
has haunted Steven
throughout his life,


2259
01:54:35.639 --> 01:54:39.889
and he has fictionalized it
in all kinds of ways on film.


2260
01:54:39.889 --> 01:54:42.931
It's the heart of him.

2261
01:54:42.931 --> 01:54:44.513
Arnold:
Although I liked
the movies,


2262
01:54:44.513 --> 01:54:46.430
I noticed the absence
of the father


2263
01:54:46.430 --> 01:54:48.347
quite significantly.

2264
01:54:48.347 --> 01:54:51.097
For a long time,
Steven was very mad at me.


2265
01:54:51.097 --> 01:54:52.513
There he is.

2266
01:54:52.513 --> 01:54:55.097
( music blaring
over headphones )


2267
01:54:55.097 --> 01:54:58.097
- Get a hug?
- Arnold: I was hurt by it,
but quietly hurt.


2268
01:54:58.097 --> 01:55:00.597
Confusing handshake?
Kick in the teeth?


2269
01:55:00.597 --> 01:55:02.347
Arnold:
I didn't broach it
with Steven.


2270
01:55:02.347 --> 01:55:06.263
I just ate it up
a little bit


2271
01:55:06.263 --> 01:55:08.430
and hurt a little bit.

2272
01:55:08.430 --> 01:55:12.305
- ( gasps )
- I thought I had
lost you, boy.


2273
01:55:12.305 --> 01:55:14.931
( sighs )
I thought
you had too, sir.


2274
01:55:14.931 --> 01:55:17.680
Spielberg:
My dad and I finally
resolved our differences,


2275
01:55:17.680 --> 01:55:22.305
and we're probably closer now
than we ever were before.


2276
01:55:22.305 --> 01:55:24.513
Arnold:
When he made
"Saving Private Ryan,"


2277
01:55:24.513 --> 01:55:26.889
he said,
"I made this for my dad."


2278
01:55:26.889 --> 01:55:28.347
And that was wonderful.

2279
01:55:28.347 --> 01:55:31.263
That made me feel warm
right here.


2280
01:55:42.305 --> 01:55:43.889
( horn beeping )

2281
01:55:46.097 --> 01:55:49.931
Lawrence Kasdan:
Steven has always had
a big vision


2282
01:55:49.931 --> 01:55:52.597
of what movies can be.

2283
01:55:54.597 --> 01:55:57.513
He's an American moviemaker.

2284
01:55:57.513 --> 01:56:01.972
And it's not
starry-eyed patriotism.


2285
01:56:01.972 --> 01:56:03.639
Woman:
Animals!


2286
01:56:03.639 --> 01:56:06.181
Kasdan:
He is drawn
to all the themes


2287
01:56:06.181 --> 01:56:09.847
that are inherent
in the American character


2288
01:56:09.847 --> 01:56:13.472
and the American society
and how it developed.


2289
01:56:13.472 --> 01:56:15.472
Insdorf:
There are people struggling


2290
01:56:15.472 --> 01:56:19.097
in one way or another
for freedom in these movies.


2291
01:56:19.097 --> 01:56:23.847
Give... us free.

2292
01:56:23.847 --> 01:56:25.972
He doesn't take freedom
for granted.


2293
01:56:27.388 --> 01:56:29.680
Kaminski:
Liberty and equality,


2294
01:56:29.680 --> 01:56:32.056
the Constitution,

2295
01:56:32.056 --> 01:56:33.639
and the rights
of the individual.


2296
01:56:33.639 --> 01:56:35.181
( cheering )

2297
01:56:35.181 --> 01:56:38.014
Kaminski:
He's evolved
as a filmmaker.


2298
01:56:38.014 --> 01:56:41.513
"Amistad" and "Lincoln"
and "Bridge of Spies"


2299
01:56:41.513 --> 01:56:43.139
are all about
the rule of law.


2300
01:56:43.139 --> 01:56:46.014
They're all about
the rights of even people


2301
01:56:46.014 --> 01:56:49.263
who are either brought here
against their will


2302
01:56:49.263 --> 01:56:54.014
or come here to be a soldier
in an opposing army


2303
01:56:54.014 --> 01:56:55.680
and are caught.

2304
01:56:55.680 --> 01:56:58.430
The law fully covers
everyone.


2305
01:56:58.430 --> 01:56:59.722
Tom:
We were supposed to show


2306
01:56:59.722 --> 01:57:02.056
he had a capable defense,
which we did.


2307
01:57:02.056 --> 01:57:04.722
Why are you citing
the goddamn Constitution
at me?


2308
01:57:04.722 --> 01:57:06.305
Tom, if you look me
in the eye


2309
01:57:06.305 --> 01:57:08.181
and tell me
we don't have grounds


2310
01:57:08.181 --> 01:57:09.555
for an appeal,
I'll drop it right now.


2311
01:57:09.555 --> 01:57:11.805
I'm not saying that.
You know what I'm saying.


2312
01:57:11.805 --> 01:57:13.805
Tom is saying
there's a cost
to these things.


2313
01:57:13.805 --> 01:57:15.680
That's right.

2314
01:57:15.680 --> 01:57:18.680
A cost to both
your family and your firm.


2315
01:57:18.680 --> 01:57:20.347
Spielberg:
I really believe
in this country,


2316
01:57:20.347 --> 01:57:21.847
and I always have.

2317
01:57:21.847 --> 01:57:24.056
And it just resonated
throughout my work--


2318
01:57:24.056 --> 01:57:25.931
wanting to tell
American stories,


2319
01:57:25.931 --> 01:57:28.722
wanting to tell stories
about principled,
ethical people


2320
01:57:28.722 --> 01:57:30.555
who, against all advice

2321
01:57:30.555 --> 01:57:33.764
and against
most everyone else's
better judgment,


2322
01:57:33.764 --> 01:57:36.639
just proceed to do
the right thing.


2323
01:57:36.639 --> 01:57:40.764
I'm sure that sounds like
I'm this kind of, you know,


2324
01:57:40.764 --> 01:57:44.889
idealist or some sort
of a patriot,


2325
01:57:44.889 --> 01:57:46.889
but I am a patriot.

2326
01:57:46.889 --> 01:57:49.472
And I'm somewhat
of an idealist, too.


2327
01:57:49.472 --> 01:57:52.555
Say all we done
is show the world


2328
01:57:52.555 --> 01:57:54.889
that democracy
isn't chaos.


2329
01:57:57.597 --> 01:58:01.222
That there is a great
invisible strength


2330
01:58:01.222 --> 01:58:03.181
in a people's union.

2331
01:58:03.181 --> 01:58:05.764
Say we've shown
that a people can endure


2332
01:58:05.764 --> 01:58:09.513
awful sacrifice
and yet cohere.


2333
01:58:09.513 --> 01:58:12.181
Mightn't that save
at least the idea
of democracy,


2334
01:58:12.181 --> 01:58:14.555
to aspire to?

2335
01:58:14.555 --> 01:58:17.388
Eventually to become
worthy of?


2336
01:58:17.388 --> 01:58:19.430
Daniel Day-Lewis:
The first thing that
you have to overcome


2337
01:58:19.430 --> 01:58:21.555
is the reluctance
to even approach Lincoln


2338
01:58:21.555 --> 01:58:24.097
because he's such
a mighty figure.


2339
01:58:24.097 --> 01:58:26.931
His experience as a president
was in, you know,


2340
01:58:26.931 --> 01:58:30.097
one of the greatest crises
that this country's ever known.


2341
01:58:30.097 --> 01:58:33.014
And so, undoubtedly,
of course,


2342
01:58:33.014 --> 01:58:36.847
he made decisions that were
extremely unpalatable


2343
01:58:36.847 --> 01:58:38.597
to many, many people.

2344
01:58:38.597 --> 01:58:42.639
We are
absolutely guaranteed
to lose the whole thing.


2345
01:58:42.639 --> 01:58:45.847
We don't need a goddamned
abolition amendment.


2346
01:58:45.847 --> 01:58:48.181
Leave the Constitution
alone!


2347
01:58:48.181 --> 01:58:50.305
James:
...peace commissioners
appear today, or--


2348
01:58:50.305 --> 01:58:51.805
( overlapping voices )

2349
01:58:51.805 --> 01:58:53.139
( argument stops )

2350
01:58:54.388 --> 01:58:57.139
I can't listen
to this anymore.


2351
01:58:58.764 --> 01:59:02.056
I can't accomplish
a goddamn thing


2352
01:59:02.056 --> 01:59:04.513
of any human
meaning or worth


2353
01:59:04.513 --> 01:59:08.305
until we cure
ourselves of slavery


2354
01:59:08.305 --> 01:59:11.847
and end
this pestilential war!


2355
01:59:11.847 --> 01:59:15.263
And whether any of you
or anyone else knows it,


2356
01:59:15.263 --> 01:59:17.847
I know I need this!

2357
01:59:17.847 --> 01:59:21.347
This amendment
is that cure!


2358
01:59:21.347 --> 01:59:23.263
Steven worked a long time

2359
01:59:23.263 --> 01:59:25.722
to find where the story was
to tell it.


2360
01:59:25.722 --> 01:59:29.555
Kushner: And it took guts
for Steven to make a movie
about Abraham Lincoln


2361
01:59:29.555 --> 01:59:33.847
in which Lincoln
shares top billing with
the House of Representatives.


2362
01:59:33.847 --> 01:59:36.263
Doris Kearns Goodwin:
He had faith that if he told
a story


2363
01:59:36.263 --> 01:59:39.513
that is about democracy
and it's about messiness
and politics--


2364
01:59:39.513 --> 01:59:41.680
and people
are on different sides
of the issue,


2365
01:59:41.680 --> 01:59:43.680
and people
who were Democrats then
are Republicans now,


2366
01:59:43.680 --> 01:59:45.222
and Republicans now
were Democrats then,


2367
01:59:45.222 --> 01:59:47.847
was pretty confusing
for people to get a sense


2368
01:59:47.847 --> 01:59:49.513
right away
of what the story was.


2369
01:59:49.513 --> 01:59:52.222
But he somehow thought
if the American people


2370
01:59:52.222 --> 01:59:54.639
can feel this man
and feel what he was doing,


2371
01:59:54.639 --> 01:59:57.680
they'll see what democracy is
when it really works.


2372
01:59:57.680 --> 01:59:59.931
Schuyler:
A motion has been made
to bring the bill


2373
01:59:59.931 --> 02:00:02.263
for the 13th Amendment
to a vote.


2374
02:00:02.263 --> 02:00:04.263
- Do I hear a second?
- I second the motion.


2375
02:00:04.263 --> 02:00:06.555
- ( gravel bangs )
- So moved, so ordered.


2376
02:00:06.555 --> 02:00:09.931
And in the end,
it's not Lincoln's triumph


2377
02:00:09.931 --> 02:00:12.222
that's pushed to the fore
in the film.


2378
02:00:12.222 --> 02:00:14.097
I think what's really
pushed to the fore


2379
02:00:14.097 --> 02:00:16.555
is that it's a triumph
of democracy.


2380
02:00:16.555 --> 02:00:20.847
The part assigned to me
is to raise the flag.


2381
02:00:20.847 --> 02:00:25.764
And when up,
it'll be for the people
to keep it up.


2382
02:00:28.513 --> 02:00:29.805
That's my speech.

2383
02:00:29.805 --> 02:00:32.889
( crowd laughing,
applauding )


2384

Father Abraham ♪

2389
02:00:45.097 --> 02:00:47.056
( music playing )

2390
02:00:51.764 --> 02:00:54.263
( moaning )
Oh, yeah!


2391
02:00:54.263 --> 02:00:55.388
( chattering )

2392
02:00:58.263 --> 02:00:59.889
Todd McCarthy:
From about the time


2393
02:00:59.889 --> 02:01:01.931
of the millennium
in Spielberg's career,


2394
02:01:01.931 --> 02:01:06.347
there is something,
whether it's personal,
political, historical,


2395
02:01:06.347 --> 02:01:10.388
that pushed him
in a more adventurous
and a darker direction.


2396
02:01:10.388 --> 02:01:12.181
I fundamentally
don't buy


2397
02:01:12.181 --> 02:01:14.764
that he has
a pessimistic worldview


2398
02:01:14.764 --> 02:01:19.181
or that he suddenly changed
and has a more dubious opinion


2399
02:01:19.181 --> 02:01:21.931
of the human race,
but still,


2400
02:01:21.931 --> 02:01:24.805
there's been
an alteration.


2401
02:01:24.805 --> 02:01:27.305
He has been willing
to go places


2402
02:01:27.305 --> 02:01:30.430
that he would not have gone
in his earlier films.


2403
02:01:31.472 --> 02:01:33.847
( chatter on TV )

2404
02:01:35.430 --> 02:01:37.680
All right, Howard Marks.
Where are you?


2405
02:01:37.680 --> 02:01:40.139
It was a very complicated
story, "Minority Report."


2406
02:01:40.139 --> 02:01:41.764
A very dark story,
actually.


2407
02:01:41.764 --> 02:01:44.305
You know, democracy,
freedom of choice,


2408
02:01:44.305 --> 02:01:46.722
corruption.

2409
02:01:46.722 --> 02:01:49.097
Spielberg:
That dark, futuristic
dystopian tone


2410
02:01:49.097 --> 02:01:51.513
was so compelling for me
at that time.


2411
02:01:51.513 --> 02:01:53.472
Kushner:
Tennessee Williams
says that artists


2412
02:01:53.472 --> 02:01:55.680
are like the canaries
in the coal mine.


2413
02:01:55.680 --> 02:01:58.222
And Steven has
an uncanny knack


2414
02:01:58.222 --> 02:02:02.263
for feeling what's going on
in the world around him


2415
02:02:02.263 --> 02:02:05.764
and what needs to be said
at its moment.


2416
02:02:05.764 --> 02:02:09.014
I think he's
a very present filmmaker.


2417
02:02:09.014 --> 02:02:11.388
By mandate
of the District of Columbia
Precrime Division,


2418
02:02:11.388 --> 02:02:14.847
I'm placing you under
arrest for the future murder
of Sarah Marks and Donald...


2419
02:02:14.847 --> 02:02:18.388
Hoberman:
The film anticipated
the whole post-9/11 mentality


2420
02:02:18.388 --> 02:02:21.388
of arresting people
before they can commit crimes


2421
02:02:21.388 --> 02:02:23.014
and preventive detention
and so on.


2422
02:02:27.097 --> 02:02:28.639
Spielberg:
But the movie that I made


2423
02:02:28.639 --> 02:02:31.847
that was a real statement
about 9/11


2424
02:02:31.847 --> 02:02:33.181
was "War of the Worlds."

2425
02:02:33.181 --> 02:02:35.139
( people screaming )

2426
02:02:37.181 --> 02:02:40.889
Spielberg:
For me, it began with
what would really happen


2427
02:02:40.889 --> 02:02:42.805
if we were invaded

2428
02:02:42.805 --> 02:02:44.722
and everything
that we thought


2429
02:02:44.722 --> 02:02:47.889
made us invulnerable
to invasion


2430
02:02:47.889 --> 02:02:48.972
was all wrong?

2431
02:02:51.222 --> 02:02:53.097
( people screaming )

2432
02:03:00.639 --> 02:03:02.764
Koepp:
There's a sequence
where Cruise's character


2433
02:03:02.764 --> 02:03:05.764
runs through the streets
and the ray is turning
people to dust


2434
02:03:05.764 --> 02:03:09.097
and some of that dust
is in his hair.


2435
02:03:09.097 --> 02:03:11.263
And he comes home
and sees himself in shock


2436
02:03:11.263 --> 02:03:14.805
and realizes
that that's remains
that are in his hair.


2437
02:03:14.805 --> 02:03:16.513
- Oh!
- ( water running )


2438
02:03:16.513 --> 02:03:19.222
Koepp:
Steven handled that
with great tact.


2439
02:03:19.222 --> 02:03:22.014
9/11 was so much a part
of our national psyche,


2440
02:03:22.014 --> 02:03:25.263
you didn't have to do much
to evoke the shock we all felt


2441
02:03:25.263 --> 02:03:28.181
and the helplessness
we all felt at being attacked.


2442
02:03:31.680 --> 02:03:34.305
( all shouting )

2443
02:03:37.305 --> 02:03:40.056
( shouting continues )

2444
02:03:43.722 --> 02:03:45.597
( screaming )

2445
02:03:45.597 --> 02:03:49.597
( shouting continues )

2446
02:03:49.597 --> 02:03:51.722
Good afternoon.
I'm Jim McKay speaking to you


2447
02:03:51.722 --> 02:03:54.847
live at this moment
from ABC headquarters


2448
02:03:54.847 --> 02:03:58.181
just outside the Olympic Village
in Munich, West Germany.


2449
02:03:58.181 --> 02:04:01.263
The peace of what is--
would've been called
the "Serene Olympics"


2450
02:04:01.263 --> 02:04:04.889
was shattered just before dawn
this morning about 5:00.


2451
02:04:04.889 --> 02:04:08.139
- ( chatter )
- Kushner: Nobody was
expecting Steven Spielberg,


2452
02:04:08.139 --> 02:04:10.764
maybe the world's
most famous Jewish artist,


2453
02:04:10.764 --> 02:04:12.513
to weigh in
on the Middle East


2454
02:04:12.513 --> 02:04:14.347
because
it's such a minefield,


2455
02:04:14.347 --> 02:04:16.472
and Steven
is not a sensationalist


2456
02:04:16.472 --> 02:04:19.805
in the sense
of wanting to create,


2457
02:04:19.805 --> 02:04:22.555
you know, firestorms
of controversy.


2458
02:04:22.555 --> 02:04:25.014
- Jim: This is
building number 31.
- ( chatter )


2459
02:04:25.014 --> 02:04:26.764
At this moment,

2460
02:04:26.764 --> 02:04:29.972
eight or nine terrified
living human beings


2461
02:04:29.972 --> 02:04:31.847
- are being held prisoner.
- ( chanting )


2462
02:04:31.847 --> 02:04:35.097
Spielberg:
I felt I could not
make this one-sided.


2463
02:04:35.097 --> 02:04:39.555
And so, I knew
it would be controversial
from the very get-go.


2464
02:04:39.555 --> 02:04:42.472
( woman vocalizing )

2465
02:04:51.764 --> 02:04:53.805
- ( chatter on TV )
- ( overlapping voices )


2466
02:04:56.181 --> 02:04:59.388
Eric Bana:
It was that story
of the group of Mossad agents


2467
02:04:59.388 --> 02:05:01.931
who were assembled
to avenge the deaths


2468
02:05:01.931 --> 02:05:04.972
of the Israeli athletes
at the Munich Olympics.


2469
02:05:09.097 --> 02:05:13.305
It was their job
to go after a list
of targeted men


2470
02:05:13.305 --> 02:05:16.472
who were part
of a terrorist group.


2471
02:05:16.472 --> 02:05:20.430
And it was
their job to, one by one,
assassinate them.


2472
02:05:20.430 --> 02:05:23.931
Daniel Craig:
This movie was trying to affect
and turn on a debate.


2473
02:05:23.931 --> 02:05:27.014
Is vengeance the answer?
Does it actually
solve anything?


2474
02:05:27.014 --> 02:05:29.014
If you continue
the cycle of violence


2475
02:05:29.014 --> 02:05:30.847
and cycle of blood,
then...


2476
02:05:30.847 --> 02:05:33.847
that's what they'll be
and nothing else.


2477
02:05:36.014 --> 02:05:38.639
Steven was very keen
to tell a human story,


2478
02:05:38.639 --> 02:05:42.305
that these were men
and not superheroes.


2479
02:05:42.305 --> 02:05:45.513
Their indecision
and their mistakes


2480
02:05:45.513 --> 02:05:49.014
and their-- is the reality
of what happened, you know?


2481
02:05:49.014 --> 02:05:51.722
Life isn't
a "James Bond" movie.
( chuckles )


2482
02:05:51.722 --> 02:05:53.347
Are you--
are you Wael Zwaiter?


2483
02:05:53.347 --> 02:05:55.597
He said yes already.
He already said yes.


2484
02:05:55.597 --> 02:05:58.847
( speaking Arabic )

2485
02:05:58.847 --> 02:06:00.889
What are we doing?

2486
02:06:00.889 --> 02:06:03.347
( speaking Arabic )

2487
02:06:04.847 --> 02:06:06.139
What do I do?

2488
02:06:06.139 --> 02:06:08.222
Do you know
why we're here?


2489
02:06:08.222 --> 02:06:10.764
( speaking Arabic )

2490
02:06:19.097 --> 02:06:22.014
Hoberman: In "Munich,"
Spielberg is trying
to come to terms


2491
02:06:22.014 --> 02:06:24.097
with the war
against terror.


2492
02:06:24.097 --> 02:06:28.555
And he doesn't know
where he is on it.


2493
02:06:28.555 --> 02:06:30.847
He's-- he supports it,

2494
02:06:30.847 --> 02:06:34.597
but he's also
disturbed by it.


2495
02:06:34.597 --> 02:06:36.639
And so,
that's an example


2496
02:06:36.639 --> 02:06:39.430
of a kind of thoughtfulness
that goes into his work.


2497
02:06:39.430 --> 02:06:43.263
I mean,
he's the Hollywood equivalent
of a public intellectual.


2498
02:06:52.430 --> 02:06:56.097
Bana:
I remember when we shot
the telephone bomb sequence.


2499
02:06:57.305 --> 02:06:59.097
In that one dolly shot,

2500
02:06:59.097 --> 02:07:02.347
you got a complete
sense of the geography
of the entire scene.


2501
02:07:04.639 --> 02:07:07.388
Spielberg:
It took three days
to shoot the scene.


2502
02:07:07.388 --> 02:07:10.430
Everything had to be
from points of view.


2503
02:07:10.430 --> 02:07:12.889
There was the point of view
of the guys in the car.


2504
02:07:12.889 --> 02:07:17.139
So now we wait
for the red light.


2505
02:07:17.139 --> 02:07:20.305
Spielberg:
There was the point of view
of the man in the phone booth


2506
02:07:20.305 --> 02:07:21.972
who was gonna dial
the number.


2507
02:07:21.972 --> 02:07:24.181
There was a point of view
of Avner.


2508
02:07:24.181 --> 02:07:27.305
It's a triangle
of shots.


2509
02:07:27.305 --> 02:07:29.680
Geography
is one of the most
important things to me,


2510
02:07:29.680 --> 02:07:31.972
so the audience
isn't thrown into chaos


2511
02:07:31.972 --> 02:07:33.764
trying to figure out
the story you're telling.


2512
02:07:33.764 --> 02:07:36.513
The audience needs to be
clearer than you.


2513
02:07:38.889 --> 02:07:40.805
- Is the truck
blocking the signal?
- No.


2514
02:07:40.805 --> 02:07:42.305
Will the remote
still work?


2515
02:07:42.305 --> 02:07:43.972
Spielberg:
I can create suspense


2516
02:07:43.972 --> 02:07:47.347
if the audience knows
where all the players are,


2517
02:07:47.347 --> 02:07:48.931
and they know
what the stakes are,


2518
02:07:48.931 --> 02:07:51.222
and they know
that there's a ticking clock.


2519
02:07:51.222 --> 02:07:53.597
Like the mom and daughter
that get into the car


2520
02:07:53.597 --> 02:07:56.889
and then wind up returning
because she forgot the glasses.


2521
02:07:56.889 --> 02:07:58.472
( phone rings )

2522
02:08:05.639 --> 02:08:07.181
Spielberg:
The suspense
of that sequence


2523
02:08:07.181 --> 02:08:09.639
is letting the audience
know geographically


2524
02:08:09.639 --> 02:08:12.181
where everybody is
at all times.


2525
02:08:12.181 --> 02:08:15.139
Allô? Allô?

2526
02:08:17.472 --> 02:08:18.847
Allô?

2527
02:08:22.347 --> 02:08:24.889
( muffled sound )

2528
02:08:27.388 --> 02:08:29.889
( siren wailing )

2529
02:08:37.388 --> 02:08:38.430
Stop!

2530
02:08:38.430 --> 02:08:40.931
( whispering )
Stop, stop. Abort.


2531
02:08:44.263 --> 02:08:48.388
Kushner: You're in the hands
of somebody who will always
show you what you need to see


2532
02:08:48.388 --> 02:08:52.139
in order to understand,
on a narrative level,
what's happening.


2533
02:08:52.139 --> 02:08:54.222
And you'll also see
a lot of things


2534
02:08:54.222 --> 02:08:56.805
that will help you understand
on deeper levels as well.


2535
02:08:56.805 --> 02:09:02.388
And that
sort of narrative device
that's in his head


2536
02:09:02.388 --> 02:09:06.472
is, you know, I think
almost without precedent.


2537
02:09:06.472 --> 02:09:08.097
( phone ringing )

2538
02:09:12.263 --> 02:09:14.305
- Oui?
- Man: Mahmoud Hamshari?


2539
02:09:14.305 --> 02:09:15.472
Yes.

2540
02:09:15.472 --> 02:09:17.263
( explosion )

2541
02:09:22.472 --> 02:09:26.056
Kushner:
We talked a great deal
about the politics


2542
02:09:26.056 --> 02:09:28.097
of making a movie
like this.


2543
02:09:28.097 --> 02:09:30.555
How do you make a film
that allows


2544
02:09:30.555 --> 02:09:32.430
for the possibility
of understanding


2545
02:09:32.430 --> 02:09:36.097
why these men who murdered
the athletes


2546
02:09:36.097 --> 02:09:37.263
did what they did?

2547
02:09:37.263 --> 02:09:40.805
Not in any way
to excuse it,


2548
02:09:40.805 --> 02:09:43.764
but to try
and comprehend it.


2549
02:09:43.764 --> 02:09:47.472
You kill Jews, and the world
feels bad for them and thinks
you're animals.


2550
02:09:47.472 --> 02:09:49.931
Yes, but then
the world will see


2551
02:09:49.931 --> 02:09:51.805
how they've made us
into animals.


2552
02:09:51.805 --> 02:09:53.305
They'll start
to ask questions


2553
02:09:53.305 --> 02:09:55.305
about the conditions
in our cages.


2554
02:09:55.305 --> 02:09:58.139
Hoberman:
The movie was perceived
to be suffering


2555
02:09:58.139 --> 02:09:59.805
from a sense
of moral equivalence,


2556
02:09:59.805 --> 02:10:03.347
which is really
the bravest thing
about the movie.


2557
02:10:03.347 --> 02:10:07.847
It's looking
for aspects of humanity
on both sides of this conflict.


2558
02:10:07.847 --> 02:10:11.472
Ambiguity is something that
you don't normally associate
with Spielberg's films,


2559
02:10:11.472 --> 02:10:14.680
and "Munich" is the film
where he went the furthest


2560
02:10:14.680 --> 02:10:17.680
in the bluntness
and the ferocity


2561
02:10:17.680 --> 02:10:19.764
with which he approached
that subject.


2562
02:10:19.764 --> 02:10:21.972
Did we accomplish
anything at all?


2563
02:10:21.972 --> 02:10:24.805
Every man we killed
has been replaced by worse!


2564
02:10:24.805 --> 02:10:27.722
Why cut my fingernails?
They'll grow back.


2565
02:10:27.722 --> 02:10:31.555
Did we kill to replace
the terrorist leadership
or the Palestinian leadership?


2566
02:10:31.555 --> 02:10:33.347
You tell me
what we've done.


2567
02:10:33.347 --> 02:10:37.097
You killed them
for the sake of a country
you now choose to abandon.


2568
02:10:37.097 --> 02:10:39.513
The end of this film
is not celebratory--


2569
02:10:39.513 --> 02:10:41.555
rejoicing in the death
of the enemy.


2570
02:10:41.555 --> 02:10:43.263
It is incredibly quiet,

2571
02:10:43.263 --> 02:10:44.847
and only
on the second viewing


2572
02:10:44.847 --> 02:10:46.764
did I realize
the Twin Towers


2573
02:10:46.764 --> 02:10:48.555
are revealed at the end.

2574
02:10:50.680 --> 02:10:52.889
Kaminski:
We did several takes
of that scene


2575
02:10:52.889 --> 02:10:55.513
without having
that space in the frame,


2576
02:10:55.513 --> 02:10:57.014
and then we did one take

2577
02:10:57.014 --> 02:10:58.764
with having that space
in the frame,


2578
02:10:58.764 --> 02:11:02.181
knowing that he would put
the Towers in.


2579
02:11:02.181 --> 02:11:05.222
Steven knew that he's making
a controversial movie.


2580
02:11:05.222 --> 02:11:07.222
He just didn't want
to push the boundaries.


2581
02:11:07.222 --> 02:11:08.680
But then at the end,
he realized,


2582
02:11:08.680 --> 02:11:10.680
"You know what?
I'm already doing it.


2583
02:11:10.680 --> 02:11:14.680
Why not just go and say
what I want to say,
you know?"


2584
02:11:18.139 --> 02:11:21.680
Spielberg:
I made the choice because
I wanted people to say


2585
02:11:21.680 --> 02:11:23.555
"Munich" is the context

2586
02:11:23.555 --> 02:11:26.722
for problems that exist
in today's world


2587
02:11:26.722 --> 02:11:30.305
and basically
are threatening
to all of us.


2588
02:11:30.305 --> 02:11:34.222
You know, history
is its own reminder


2589
02:11:34.222 --> 02:11:38.388
of how bad things
can get.


2590
02:11:38.388 --> 02:11:41.639
And if we don't
solve these problems,


2591
02:11:41.639 --> 02:11:43.639
they accumulate.

2592
02:11:43.639 --> 02:11:45.555
And you can't--
there's no rug big enough


2593
02:11:45.555 --> 02:11:47.388
to sweep
these problems under.


2594
02:11:47.388 --> 02:11:50.680
And eventually,
something is going to happen.


2595
02:11:50.680 --> 02:11:53.639
And so, "Munich"
is a prayer for peace,


2596
02:11:53.639 --> 02:11:55.388
but peace the hard way.

2597
02:11:55.388 --> 02:11:58.430
You know,
peace by discovering
within yourself


2598
02:11:58.430 --> 02:12:00.972
your moral high ground.

2599
02:12:07.222 --> 02:12:09.139
All my films come
from the part of myself


2600
02:12:09.139 --> 02:12:11.222
that I really can't
articulate.


2601
02:12:11.222 --> 02:12:14.056
I certainly have
intuitive facilities,


2602
02:12:14.056 --> 02:12:16.931
but I don't really analyze those
or don't really question them.


2603
02:12:16.931 --> 02:12:19.305
It's like looking
a gift horse in the mouth,


2604
02:12:19.305 --> 02:12:22.347
and I'm almost superstitious
that if I start to
question that,


2605
02:12:22.347 --> 02:12:24.555
it's gonna, you know,
fly away.


2606
02:12:24.555 --> 02:12:27.263
Scorsese:
I don't think there's
any doubt that Steven's work


2607
02:12:27.263 --> 02:12:29.889
deals with specific themes
in his life,


2608
02:12:29.889 --> 02:12:33.347
which makes him
a real personal filmmaker.


2609
02:12:33.347 --> 02:12:38.139
Do you understand
what we are saying
to you, Frank?


2610
02:12:38.139 --> 02:12:41.805
Your father and I
are getting a divorce.


2611
02:12:41.805 --> 02:12:43.680
And his express
through the images,


2612
02:12:43.680 --> 02:12:46.263
through the choice of story
and how he deals with character.


2613
02:12:46.263 --> 02:12:48.139
( music playing )

2614
02:12:50.639 --> 02:12:52.513
All of Steven's
sensibilities


2615
02:12:52.513 --> 02:12:56.263
were right in tune
with this young man's journey.


2616
02:12:57.805 --> 02:12:59.847
You're immediately
with this kid,


2617
02:12:59.847 --> 02:13:01.305
and no matter
what he does,


2618
02:13:01.305 --> 02:13:03.388
you know he's searching
for some way back


2619
02:13:03.388 --> 02:13:06.472
to repairing
this torn household.


2620
02:13:06.472 --> 02:13:10.139
- Have you tried
to call her?
- No.


2621
02:13:10.139 --> 02:13:13.139
Why-- why don't
you call her right now?


2622
02:13:13.139 --> 02:13:15.056
Dad, why don't you
call her right now?
Here.


2623
02:13:15.056 --> 02:13:16.847
Dad, just call her.

2624
02:13:16.847 --> 02:13:18.931
Call her for me.
You call her.


2625
02:13:18.931 --> 02:13:21.847
You tell her I have
two first-class tickets
to go see her son--


2626
02:13:21.847 --> 02:13:24.305
Your mother's married now
to my friend Jack Barnes.


2627
02:13:24.305 --> 02:13:27.680
- They have a house
in Long Island.
- Oh, no.


2628
02:13:27.680 --> 02:13:29.513
Scott:
So often
in Spielberg's movies


2629
02:13:29.513 --> 02:13:31.181
the relationships
that matter


2630
02:13:31.181 --> 02:13:33.722
are the relationships
between parent and children


2631
02:13:33.722 --> 02:13:37.347
or members of a family
or members of a community


2632
02:13:37.347 --> 02:13:40.597
bound by affection
and loyalty and responsibility.


2633
02:13:40.597 --> 02:13:43.388
It's a huge theme
that comes up again
and again and again


2634
02:13:43.388 --> 02:13:45.680
in different phases
of his own life


2635
02:13:45.680 --> 02:13:47.597
and in different stories.

2636
02:13:47.597 --> 02:13:50.222
( tires screeching )

2637
02:13:50.222 --> 02:13:51.972
Whoa! Hey!

2638
02:13:51.972 --> 02:13:54.181
Ronnie, hold it.
Hold it. Wa--


2639
02:13:54.181 --> 02:13:55.222
- ( tires screech )
- Hold it.


2640
02:13:57.388 --> 02:13:59.555
Spielberg:
Family is a big element
in my life,


2641
02:13:59.555 --> 02:14:01.555
which is why
so many of my stories


2642
02:14:01.555 --> 02:14:07.097
are about separation
and then reunification.


2643
02:14:07.097 --> 02:14:11.097
Even "Lincoln"
is about separation
and reunification.


2644
02:14:16.597 --> 02:14:18.722
( screaming )

2645
02:14:18.722 --> 02:14:20.222
( gunfire )

2646
02:14:20.222 --> 02:14:23.889
- ( sobbing )
- ( glass rattling )


2647
02:14:23.889 --> 02:14:26.097
( screams )

2648
02:14:26.097 --> 02:14:27.555
Barry!

2649
02:14:27.555 --> 02:14:29.639
I've made
a lot of movies


2650
02:14:29.639 --> 02:14:33.430
about a family
disintegrating


2651
02:14:33.430 --> 02:14:38.222
and then a family
finding common ground
to reunite.


2652
02:14:38.222 --> 02:14:41.222
( music playing )

2653
02:14:45.472 --> 02:14:48.680
Kushner: There's a sense
that everything, including
the natural world,


2654
02:14:48.680 --> 02:14:52.222
conspires to pull people

2655
02:14:52.222 --> 02:14:55.347
or beings apart
from one another


2656
02:14:55.347 --> 02:14:58.056
and then to return them.

2657
02:14:58.056 --> 02:14:59.680
It's like
Shakespeare's romances.


2658
02:14:59.680 --> 02:15:05.680
There's a deep faith
in his work that...


2659
02:15:05.680 --> 02:15:09.305
what's lost
will in some way
be restored.


2660
02:15:09.305 --> 02:15:11.263
And I think
he is searching for that


2661
02:15:11.263 --> 02:15:14.972
in almost all the films
that he's made.


2662
02:15:14.972 --> 02:15:16.931
( piano music playing )

2663
02:15:18.931 --> 02:15:21.347
Man:
Now slowly.


2664
02:15:21.347 --> 02:15:23.222
Spielberg:
My mom and dad
have a relationship today


2665
02:15:23.222 --> 02:15:25.639
which a writer
in a storybook


2666
02:15:25.639 --> 02:15:27.972
would be accused
of exaggeration.


2667
02:15:27.972 --> 02:15:30.513
I feel very lucky that
after all these years apart,


2668
02:15:30.513 --> 02:15:33.764
my parents
spend quality time
with each other.


2669
02:15:33.764 --> 02:15:37.305
- ( music playing )
- Nancy: If you look
at the first 18 years


2670
02:15:37.305 --> 02:15:39.972
of Steve's life
and now, current day,


2671
02:15:39.972 --> 02:15:42.847
you would not know
that there was a huge chunk
in the middle,


2672
02:15:42.847 --> 02:15:44.555
that there was a divorce
and a separation,


2673
02:15:44.555 --> 02:15:47.305
a lot of tears,
and another man,
and another wife,


2674
02:15:47.305 --> 02:15:50.597
and, you know,
it looks like we were
one continuous, happy family.


2675
02:15:50.597 --> 02:15:52.680
We just lost the reels
to the home movies


2676
02:15:52.680 --> 02:15:54.222
in the middle of life.

2677
02:15:54.222 --> 02:15:56.764
Now she's back
in love with me.


2678
02:15:56.764 --> 02:15:57.972
Isn't that nice?

2679
02:15:57.972 --> 02:15:59.639
( music continues )

2680
02:15:59.639 --> 02:16:03.513
( laughs )
Oh, Leah.


2681
02:16:05.639 --> 02:16:07.722
Janusz, it'd be
a better two-shot.


2682
02:16:07.722 --> 02:16:10.680
If Dougie is here, okay,
then it's not such a spread.


2683
02:16:10.680 --> 02:16:14.388
- So, it's not a single.
It's over here.
- No, no, it's a single.


2684
02:16:14.388 --> 02:16:17.555
When we start pulling back,
Dougie comes into
the shot sooner.


2685
02:16:17.555 --> 02:16:18.805
And then we continue
with the move?


2686
02:16:18.805 --> 02:16:20.097
Yeah, we continue
with the move,


2687
02:16:20.097 --> 02:16:21.889
but right now
it looks like


2688
02:16:21.889 --> 02:16:24.305
- there's nothing in the center
but the window.
- Got you.


2689
02:16:24.305 --> 02:16:27.805
Hanks:
Steven loves to be a part
of a big gang of people


2690
02:16:27.805 --> 02:16:30.472
and the company of filmmakers
who are making a movie.


2691
02:16:30.472 --> 02:16:32.805
It's a big, great club.
It's a big, great family.


2692
02:16:32.805 --> 02:16:36.889
- Spielberg: Tom, action.
- Kennedy: I think it defines
Steven's filmmaking


2693
02:16:36.889 --> 02:16:38.555
in many,
many different ways


2694
02:16:38.555 --> 02:16:42.931
because Steven is grounded
and feels very safe


2695
02:16:42.931 --> 02:16:46.222
inside an environment
with family.


2696
02:16:46.222 --> 02:16:48.513
He likes
close relationships


2697
02:16:48.513 --> 02:16:51.847
with a few people
who he trusts


2698
02:16:51.847 --> 02:16:54.388
and he can open
his life up to.


2699
02:16:54.388 --> 02:16:56.722
And then he's very reluctant
to have anybody leave.


2700
02:16:56.722 --> 02:16:58.889
That's it right there.
It looks great.


2701
02:16:58.889 --> 02:17:00.722
Kaminski:
We work for Steven.


2702
02:17:00.722 --> 02:17:04.056
He's the boss,
but he encourages
people with talent


2703
02:17:04.056 --> 02:17:06.764
to use the talent,
to be brave with it,


2704
02:17:06.764 --> 02:17:08.263
to take risks,

2705
02:17:08.263 --> 02:17:10.805
because he wants to be
stimulated as a filmmaker,


2706
02:17:10.805 --> 02:17:13.097
but those
who he works with,
you know.


2707
02:17:13.097 --> 02:17:15.513
And that's
a really good quality
in a filmmaker.


2708
02:17:15.513 --> 02:17:17.430
Muren:
He's very collaborative.


2709
02:17:17.430 --> 02:17:19.430
He uses his people
over and over again
on the films


2710
02:17:19.430 --> 02:17:21.597
because we already speak
a shorthand to each other.


2711
02:17:21.597 --> 02:17:24.056
- We've all worked together.
- And they'd come on
to full size...


2712
02:17:24.056 --> 02:17:26.014
Williams:
He understands that people
and can serve him


2713
02:17:26.014 --> 02:17:28.472
and how to synchronize
his wishes with your own.


2714
02:17:28.472 --> 02:17:30.305
He would've made
a great general.


2715
02:17:30.305 --> 02:17:32.555
Day-Lewis:
If you could say
that a film unit


2716
02:17:32.555 --> 02:17:35.263
can be like
a Special Forces film crew,


2717
02:17:35.263 --> 02:17:36.639
that's what he has.

2718
02:17:36.639 --> 02:17:39.263
His team works so fast,

2719
02:17:39.263 --> 02:17:42.722
so hard getting through
a lot every day.


2720
02:17:42.722 --> 02:17:44.513
Everybody on their feet,
applauding.


2721
02:17:44.513 --> 02:17:46.097
Day-Lewis:
And I think you could
come to grief


2722
02:17:46.097 --> 02:17:47.972
very, very quickly
on Steven's set


2723
02:17:47.972 --> 02:17:49.931
if you weren't
very well prepared.


2724
02:17:49.931 --> 02:17:51.305
Everyone has to be.

2725
02:17:51.305 --> 02:17:53.597
And that creates
incredible energy.


2726
02:17:53.597 --> 02:17:56.555
( music playing )

2727
02:17:56.555 --> 02:18:00.222
Spielberg:
I work with my peeps,
and I have for decades.


2728
02:18:00.222 --> 02:18:02.263
I mean, I don't know
what I would do without them.


2729
02:18:02.263 --> 02:18:05.347
Roll sound.
Roll!


2730
02:18:05.347 --> 02:18:06.764
( chatter )

2731
02:18:06.764 --> 02:18:09.222
Spielberg:
I can't really have sanity


2732
02:18:09.222 --> 02:18:11.805
unless I have
familiarity.


2733
02:18:11.805 --> 02:18:13.722
And it's just
an extraordinary family


2734
02:18:13.722 --> 02:18:16.847
that I've been able to assemble
over all these years.


2735
02:18:16.847 --> 02:18:19.305
Kahn:
I love being
part of his tapestry,


2736
02:18:19.305 --> 02:18:21.555
so to speak, you know,
like "Fiddler on the Roof."


2737
02:18:21.555 --> 02:18:24.764
♪ After 37 years,
it's nice to know... ♪
You know?


2738
02:18:24.764 --> 02:18:27.639
Spielberg:
Michael Kahn and I
are blood brothers.


2739
02:18:27.639 --> 02:18:30.305
He started with me
on "Close Encounters
of the Third Kind,"


2740
02:18:30.305 --> 02:18:34.805
and except for one time,
he's edited every movie
I made since then.


2741
02:18:34.805 --> 02:18:37.972
Janusz Kaminski
has done everything
since "Schindler's List."


2742
02:18:37.972 --> 02:18:41.972
But John Williams
is my oldest collaboration,


2743
02:18:41.972 --> 02:18:45.597
and I depend on Johnny
more than I've depended
on anybody


2744
02:18:45.597 --> 02:18:48.056
to rewrite
my movies musically


2745
02:18:48.056 --> 02:18:52.014
and put them a rung higher
than I ever could reach.


2746
02:18:52.014 --> 02:18:54.555
You know, if I had
to go back and recast


2747
02:18:54.555 --> 02:18:57.680
the creative team
surrounding me,


2748
02:18:57.680 --> 02:19:01.097
I wouldn't be able to work
as often as I do.


2749
02:19:01.097 --> 02:19:02.513
It'd be impossible.

2750
02:19:05.014 --> 02:19:08.139
Kennedy:
Steven looks
at movies constantly


2751
02:19:08.139 --> 02:19:10.430
and over and over
and over again,


2752
02:19:10.430 --> 02:19:14.263
referencing shots
and framing and ideas.


2753
02:19:14.263 --> 02:19:16.972
That's something Steven does
all the time.


2754
02:19:16.972 --> 02:19:18.513
( boat horn blaring )

2755
02:19:20.805 --> 02:19:23.513
Spielberg:
Great filmmakers' works
live on to create


2756
02:19:23.513 --> 02:19:27.014
tremendous moments
of inspiration.


2757
02:19:27.014 --> 02:19:29.847
And so, one of the films
I still see every year


2758
02:19:29.847 --> 02:19:31.764
is "Lawrence of Arabia."

2759
02:19:31.764 --> 02:19:33.722
( music playing )

2760
02:19:39.722 --> 02:19:42.805
The shots,
the sheer vistas,


2761
02:19:42.805 --> 02:19:46.139
and the portrait
of such a complex character,


2762
02:19:46.139 --> 02:19:48.263
it's pure moviemaking.

2763
02:19:48.263 --> 02:19:49.847
Hey!

2764
02:19:49.847 --> 02:19:53.388
Hey! Hey! Hey!

2765
02:20:00.139 --> 02:20:02.056
Who are you?

2766
02:20:04.097 --> 02:20:07.097
Who are you?

2767
02:20:07.097 --> 02:20:08.805
Steven has always
wanted to work


2768
02:20:08.805 --> 02:20:12.430
in a kind of big, you know,
historical canvass like that,


2769
02:20:12.430 --> 02:20:15.222
and it took many movies
before he accomplished


2770
02:20:15.222 --> 02:20:19.222
that level
of masterly filmmaking.


2771
02:20:19.222 --> 02:20:21.931
Spielberg:
Many years ago, Pauline Kael
gave me a really great review


2772
02:20:21.931 --> 02:20:24.097
on "Sugarland Express,"
but she said,


2773
02:20:24.097 --> 02:20:26.680
"Whatever's on the surface
might be all that is there.


2774
02:20:26.680 --> 02:20:28.181
There may be nothing
behind that."


2775
02:20:28.181 --> 02:20:30.430
And she was
absolutely right.


2776
02:20:30.430 --> 02:20:33.805
I hadn't grown up yet
through the movies.


2777
02:20:33.805 --> 02:20:35.972
That was going to come
in time.


2778
02:20:35.972 --> 02:20:38.222
( music playing )

2779
02:20:42.472 --> 02:20:46.263
Maslin:
Take a look at what he's done
over close to 50 years.


2780
02:20:48.722 --> 02:20:51.222
There's certainly
a lot of variety.


2781
02:20:53.430 --> 02:20:57.722
There are
some things he's done
that haven't worked,


2782
02:20:57.722 --> 02:21:00.764
but there is absolutely
nobody like him


2783
02:21:00.764 --> 02:21:03.639
and no film career
trajectory


2784
02:21:03.639 --> 02:21:07.347
that is anything like his
in the history of film.


2785
02:21:07.347 --> 02:21:11.472
He speaks cinema
as if it's his native language.


2786
02:21:11.472 --> 02:21:14.263
He is so fluent in it
that he does things


2787
02:21:14.263 --> 02:21:16.305
that nobody else
would dare to do


2788
02:21:16.305 --> 02:21:18.722
and they are
instantly recognizable


2789
02:21:18.722 --> 02:21:21.847
as things
that are purely his.


2790
02:21:21.847 --> 02:21:25.805
Scorsese:
He has a dynamic sense
of real filmmaking.


2791
02:21:25.805 --> 02:21:27.513
I'm talking
about filmmaking of--


2792
02:21:27.513 --> 02:21:30.472
in the great
narrative tradition
of American cinema.


2793
02:21:30.472 --> 02:21:31.639
( distant explosion )

2794
02:21:31.639 --> 02:21:33.056
Coppola:
Steven was blessed


2795
02:21:33.056 --> 02:21:35.347
in that he could be
commercial


2796
02:21:35.347 --> 02:21:37.222
and he could do art.

2797
02:21:37.222 --> 02:21:39.513
That's why
I always compare him


2798
02:21:39.513 --> 02:21:41.097
to a kind
of George Gershwin,


2799
02:21:41.097 --> 02:21:43.680
because Gershwin
could write a Broadway show


2800
02:21:43.680 --> 02:21:46.097
or he could write
"Concerto in F."


2801
02:21:46.097 --> 02:21:48.847
He could both,
and very few people can do both.


2802
02:21:48.847 --> 02:21:50.722
And Steven can do both.

2803
02:21:50.722 --> 02:21:53.680
And that's a talent
you have to be born with.


2804
02:21:56.181 --> 02:21:57.972
DiCaprio:
You think of
that young kid in Arizona,


2805
02:21:57.972 --> 02:21:59.347
in the desert,
watching movies,


2806
02:21:59.347 --> 02:22:01.555
watching television
incessantly,


2807
02:22:01.555 --> 02:22:04.722
one day sneaking his way
into a studio,


2808
02:22:04.722 --> 02:22:07.014
and manifesting
his own destiny.


2809
02:22:07.014 --> 02:22:09.847
It's a pretty fantastic
Hollywood story.


2810
02:22:11.722 --> 02:22:14.597
J.J. Abrams:
He's found a way to take
his view of the world,


2811
02:22:14.597 --> 02:22:19.263
his wishful thinking,
his optimism,


2812
02:22:19.263 --> 02:22:23.347
and also his uncanny sense
of the thrill,


2813
02:22:23.347 --> 02:22:25.056
and sort of galvanize
the whole thing


2814
02:22:25.056 --> 02:22:27.847
into whatever the story is
he's telling.


2815
02:22:27.847 --> 02:22:30.222
It's authentically him.

2816
02:22:32.847 --> 02:22:34.722
Field:
Steven has a part of him


2817
02:22:34.722 --> 02:22:36.722
that wants to see
something good


2818
02:22:36.722 --> 02:22:38.430
in the darkest
of the dark


2819
02:22:38.430 --> 02:22:41.222
or that wants
to just have a playtime.


2820
02:22:45.764 --> 02:22:49.097
And there may be people
who say he's not edgy enough


2821
02:22:49.097 --> 02:22:53.222
or he's not bitter enough,
he's not quirky enough,


2822
02:22:53.222 --> 02:22:55.722
or he's not dark enough,

2823
02:22:55.722 --> 02:22:58.931
but when it's all over
and said and done,


2824
02:22:58.931 --> 02:23:02.931
what Steven has left
is enormous.


2825
02:23:04.597 --> 02:23:08.097
To have both humor
and suspense


2826
02:23:08.097 --> 02:23:10.639
and adventure and heart

2827
02:23:10.639 --> 02:23:14.430
through his grand eyes
of storytelling


2828
02:23:14.430 --> 02:23:17.847
is a hell of a good thing.

2829
02:23:17.847 --> 02:23:21.722
Day-Lewis:
Steven still has
an enormous appetite


2830
02:23:21.722 --> 02:23:23.931
for the work
that he does.


2831
02:23:23.931 --> 02:23:26.181
It's quite a rare thing.

2832
02:23:26.181 --> 02:23:29.597
You know, we all have,
probably, a shelf life.


2833
02:23:31.597 --> 02:23:34.847
Yes, we probably go
past that shelf life,


2834
02:23:34.847 --> 02:23:38.014
most of us,
without even knowing it.


2835
02:23:38.014 --> 02:23:42.472
But in his case, I think,
till the day he dies,
he'll be doing work


2836
02:23:42.472 --> 02:23:47.805
that he feels absolutely
viscerally compelled to do.


2837
02:23:55.639 --> 02:23:58.513
