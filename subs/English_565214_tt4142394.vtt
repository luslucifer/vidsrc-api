1
00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.088
The day I turned ten,
my father took me hunting for the first time.


2
00:02:29.268 --> 00:02:31.792
It was his way of telling me
that soon I would be grown up,

3
00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.752
his way to teach me about life.

4
00:02:38.146 --> 00:02:39.974
I followed him in silence,

5
00:02:40.018 --> 00:02:42.803
fully aware that
once I fired his rifle,


6
00:02:42.847 --> 00:02:45.589
the innocence of childhood
would be no more.


7
00:02:52.813 --> 00:02:55.468
He was not in a hurry
to kill an animal.


8
00:02:55.512 --> 00:02:58.253
But first, he wanted
me to understand the difference

9
00:02:58.297 --> 00:03:01.126
between being a hunter
and being a tracker.


10
00:03:13.138 --> 00:03:14.487
The hunter
kills its prey.


11
00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.795
The tracker
understands it.


12
00:03:19.318 --> 00:03:20.624
He blends with nature,

13
00:03:21.581 --> 00:03:23.365
feels its power,

14
00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:24.497
hears its call.

15
00:03:26.456 --> 00:03:29.415
Tracking is
a sacred responsibility.


16
00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.726
It finds its origin
in the origin of mankind.


17
00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.469
A tracker preserves history.

18
00:03:40.557 --> 00:03:42.472
A hunter destroys it.

19
00:03:46.911 --> 00:03:51.132
But then comes the moment
when both become one.


20
00:03:53.004 --> 00:03:54.484
That's when he told me,

21
00:03:56.007 --> 00:03:58.705
"This is what it means
to be a man."


22
00:05:34.584 --> 00:05:37.369
Hakansson, we have your wife and daughter.

23
00:05:37.412 --> 00:05:40.459
Half a million, if you
want to see them alive.

24
00:05:40.502 --> 00:05:45.072
Tonight at 11:00,
Route 39, kilometer 28.


25
00:05:45.116 --> 00:05:47.597
You alone, no police.

26
00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:49.642
No police. You understand?

27
00:06:01.872 --> 00:06:03.003
Get in.

28
00:06:03.047 --> 00:06:04.614
Where are you taking us?

29
00:06:09.619 --> 00:06:10.750
Let me go.

30
00:06:13.361 --> 00:06:15.015
Let me go. Get in the car.

31
00:06:44.915 --> 00:06:45.915
Help.

32
00:06:47.831 --> 00:06:50.137
Help! I feel bad. Help me!

33
00:06:56.753 --> 00:06:57.797
Oh!

34
00:07:30.003 --> 00:07:31.459
Don't worry, baby.

35
00:07:31.483 --> 00:07:33.180
Everything will be all right.

36
00:07:33.224 --> 00:07:34.747
We are going to see Daddy soon.

37
00:08:28.409 --> 00:08:29.865
The prisoner escaped.

38
00:08:29.889 --> 00:08:31.089
Okay, we're on it.

39
00:08:31.804 --> 00:08:32.804
Move, boys.

40
00:09:15.892 --> 00:09:18.416
Go!

41
00:09:48.272 --> 00:09:49.751
Mummy! Mummy!

42
00:09:49.795 --> 00:09:50.970
No.

43
00:09:51.014 --> 00:09:52.885
Mummy! Mummy!

44
00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:10.076
No!

45
00:11:09.744 --> 00:11:10.789
Did you find them?

46
00:11:12.486 --> 00:11:13.486
Yeah.

47
00:11:14.358 --> 00:11:15.446
We found them this morning.

48
00:11:16.577 --> 00:11:17.752
Where are they?

49
00:11:23.889 --> 00:11:24.889
I'm sorry.

50
00:11:50.394 --> 00:11:52.831
Mr. Hakansson,
it's Detective Laterza.


51
00:11:52.874 --> 00:11:56.139
I have to see you.
I have information regarding your family.


52
00:11:56.182 --> 00:11:58.793
Meet me at Cafe La Piazzetta in Taranto, 
Wednesday at 4:00 p.m.

53
00:13:21.137 --> 00:13:22.137
Okay.

54
00:13:22.877 --> 00:13:24.314
Almost there.

55
00:13:24.357 --> 00:13:25.924
About an hour or so?

56
00:13:30.146 --> 00:13:31.756
Hey, be honest.

57
00:13:31.799 --> 00:13:35.281
How excited are you
that we're about to go live


58
00:13:35.325 --> 00:13:38.067
in a small town
in southern Italy


59
00:13:39.068 --> 00:13:40.460
for two or three years?

60
00:13:41.157 --> 00:13:42.201
Very excited.

61
00:13:43.637 --> 00:13:44.682
Really?

62
00:13:44.725 --> 00:13:45.726
Yeah.

63
00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:46.771
Okay.

64
00:14:03.918 --> 00:14:06.138
Mister Ha-kan-sson.

65
00:14:07.183 --> 00:14:08.271
That's right.

66
00:14:08.314 --> 00:14:09.968
I'm glad you made it.

67
00:14:10.011 --> 00:14:12.405
- A long flight from L.A.
- Yeah.


68
00:14:12.449 --> 00:14:14.581
Right? Yes.

69
00:14:14.625 --> 00:14:17.018
I have all the billing
information I need.


70
00:14:18.237 --> 00:14:19.673
Do you want me
to show you around?


71
00:14:19.717 --> 00:14:21.414
It's a very nice place.

72
00:14:21.458 --> 00:14:22.763
It's okay.Okay.

73
00:14:22.807 --> 00:14:24.591
Just the key, please.Sure.

74
00:14:24.635 --> 00:14:25.873
This is your key. Thanks a lot.

75
00:14:25.897 --> 00:14:27.899
Call me
if you have any problem.


76
00:14:27.942 --> 00:14:30.423
All right. You can call me
when you want.


77
00:14:30.467 --> 00:14:32.686
I will. Thank you. 
Thank you so much.

78
00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:33.730
Bye.Thanks.

79
00:14:51.227 --> 00:14:52.924
You all right? Yeah.

80
00:14:55.361 --> 00:14:56.401
Whew.

81
00:14:59.365 --> 00:15:00.365
Wow.

82
00:15:03.587 --> 00:15:04.892
Okay.

83
00:15:06.981 --> 00:15:08.113
You okay?

84
00:15:08.157 --> 00:15:09.201
Yeah.

85
00:15:09.245 --> 00:15:10.507
Nice, huh?

86
00:15:12.291 --> 00:15:13.553
Yeah.

87
00:15:18.123 --> 00:15:19.342
I gotta sit down.

88
00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:28.612
Not bad.

89
00:15:28.655 --> 00:15:29.787
I love it.

90
00:15:36.924 --> 00:15:38.293
I think I could live here
for a while.


91
00:15:38.317 --> 00:15:39.927
Yeah.

92
00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:49.372
Are you not gonna help unpack
for the tired pregnant woman?


93
00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:53.550
I have to carry the babies
and give birth to them.


94
00:15:59.991 --> 00:16:02.080
Thanks for coming with me.

95
00:16:02.123 --> 00:16:05.431
Thought you could just knock me up and
leave me with these two little guys?


96
00:16:08.347 --> 00:16:11.568
Boys? You sure? 
Is that what you want?

97
00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:16.190
It doesn't matter.
I mean, as long as they're...


98
00:16:16.573 --> 00:16:17.791
Yours.

99
00:16:17.835 --> 00:16:19.358
No.

100
00:16:19.402 --> 00:16:20.881
As long as they're healthy.

101
00:16:20.925 --> 00:16:22.100
And mine.

102
00:16:29.629 --> 00:16:31.069
San Gallo, I'll miss it.

103
00:16:31.979 --> 00:16:32.979
No.

104
00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:36.288
You'll be way happier
where I'm taking you.


105
00:16:38.334 --> 00:16:39.944
One gets fond
of places...


106
00:16:40.553 --> 00:16:42.468
of people.

107
00:16:42.512 --> 00:16:43.512
It's not worth it.

108
00:16:44.383 --> 00:16:46.255
We conquered this place.

109
00:16:47.908 --> 00:16:49.432
But it never welcomed us.

110
00:16:51.521 --> 00:16:53.262
Giordano
is going to betray us.


111
00:16:56.961 --> 00:16:58.005
Do you want me to...

112
00:16:58.919 --> 00:16:59.964
Yes.

113
00:17:02.445 --> 00:17:03.446
Yes.

114
00:18:24.222 --> 00:18:25.310
May I?

115
00:18:25.354 --> 00:18:27.138
Come in.

116
00:18:27.181 --> 00:18:29.619
I'm Commissioner Graziani.

117
00:18:29.662 --> 00:18:32.056
I have a meeting
with Detective Giordano.


118
00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:34.058
He's not here.

119
00:18:37.191 --> 00:18:39.368
Can't you ask someone else,
perhaps?


120
00:18:40.064 --> 00:18:41.065
Thank you.

121
00:18:48.507 --> 00:18:49.639
Sartori?

122
00:18:50.901 --> 00:18:52.119
Yes, he's here.

123
00:18:57.298 --> 00:18:58.996
Just a minute.Thanks.

124
00:19:20.452 --> 00:19:21.584
Leotrim.

125
00:19:23.150 --> 00:19:24.804
Commissario Giordano.

126
00:19:26.676 --> 00:19:28.417
Don't be nervous.

127
00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:29.548
Nobody can hear us.

128
00:19:30.984 --> 00:19:33.291
I don't trust fish,
if you ask me.


129
00:19:33.334 --> 00:19:35.989
Well, you can trust me,
Gudon Leotrim.


130
00:19:39.123 --> 00:19:41.342
Don't worry.

131
00:19:41.386 --> 00:19:44.128
I'm not planning to shoot a police officer,
at least not today.


132
00:19:46.696 --> 00:19:48.872
Aren't you forgetting something?

133
00:19:48.915 --> 00:19:53.442
Lupo will get his next shipment

134
00:19:54.312 --> 00:19:56.053
By land, not by sea.

135
00:19:56.096 --> 00:19:57.402
By land?

136
00:19:57.968 --> 00:19:59.273
Trucks.

137
00:19:59.317 --> 00:20:00.623
What do you suggest?

138
00:20:02.059 --> 00:20:04.191
Wait, they process it,
and you ship it out.


139
00:20:05.976 --> 00:20:07.281
I might just do that.

140
00:20:14.593 --> 00:20:15.593
I will live with that.

141
00:20:16.508 --> 00:20:17.814
That makes the two of us.

142
00:20:19.293 --> 00:20:20.338
Good.

143
00:20:21.731 --> 00:20:23.011
Are you comfortable?

144
00:20:23.602 --> 00:20:25.386
Graziani? From Torino?

145
00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:26.779
Yes, sir. Follow me.

146
00:20:26.823 --> 00:20:28.346
This is your office.

147
00:20:30.696 --> 00:20:32.481
And what's with the stuff?

148
00:20:33.525 --> 00:20:34.613
Training.

149
00:20:34.657 --> 00:20:36.223
That's called training.

150
00:20:36.267 --> 00:20:37.877
Two or three years
in a place like this,


151
00:20:37.921 --> 00:20:39.836
and you go back home
with a good promotion.


152
00:20:39.879 --> 00:20:41.577
This is your plan, right?

153
00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:44.362
Actually, no.
Excuse me, are you mad at me, by any chance?


154
00:20:44.405 --> 00:20:46.016
Yes. Welcome to Taranto.

155
00:20:46.625 --> 00:20:47.931
Good work.

156
00:20:47.974 --> 00:20:49.367
Go fuck yours...

157
00:20:49.410 --> 00:20:52.544
Excuse me? No, 
I mean, "Go for it."

158
00:20:55.547 --> 00:20:57.723
What a great start.

159
00:21:23.967 --> 00:21:25.047
He didn't move.

160
00:21:41.071 --> 00:21:42.594
Bye. Bye, man.

161
00:21:45.989 --> 00:21:48.109
I'm sorry, sir. 
We're closing.

162
00:21:48.644 --> 00:21:49.906
Excuse me. Um...

163
00:21:52.212 --> 00:21:54.911
Do you happen to know
a Detective Laterza?


164
00:21:57.478 --> 00:21:59.350
Is that who
you were waiting for?


165
00:21:59.393 --> 00:22:00.394
Yeah.

166
00:22:03.963 --> 00:22:06.313
He committed suicide
four days ago.


167
00:22:10.970 --> 00:22:11.970
Are you sure?

168
00:22:12.624 --> 00:22:13.756
I'm sorry.

169
00:22:18.195 --> 00:22:19.283
Okay.

170
00:22:24.114 --> 00:22:25.289
Do you know where he lived?

171
00:22:26.986 --> 00:22:28.466
The last house
on the street.


172
00:23:50.983 --> 00:23:51.983
Hey.

173
00:23:53.290 --> 00:23:54.726
There he is.

174
00:23:54.770 --> 00:23:55.770
Ciao, love.

175
00:23:56.772 --> 00:23:58.251
Oh, you look exhausted.

176
00:23:58.295 --> 00:24:00.123
I am.

177
00:24:00.166 --> 00:24:02.865
You can't imagine
the day I had today.


178
00:24:03.822 --> 00:24:05.215
That bad?

179
00:24:05.258 --> 00:24:06.695
Did you solve
a big case?


180
00:24:10.786 --> 00:24:12.265
Wanna see my battle wounds?

181
00:24:12.309 --> 00:24:13.527
Yeah.Yeah.

182
00:24:17.706 --> 00:24:18.837
Okay.

183
00:24:18.881 --> 00:24:21.405
Look.

184
00:24:23.015 --> 00:24:24.060
Look at that.

185
00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:26.627
No gunshots here.

186
00:24:27.803 --> 00:24:28.891
Look at this.

187
00:24:29.543 --> 00:24:30.543
Mm-hmm...

188
00:24:32.416 --> 00:24:33.722
I think this is a paper cut.

189
00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:37.987
And there's
a carpal tunnel here.


190
00:24:38.030 --> 00:24:39.597
Paperwork.

191
00:24:41.251 --> 00:24:42.426
What are you reading?

192
00:24:43.732 --> 00:24:44.776
All right, listen to this.

193
00:24:46.952 --> 00:24:49.520
"April is
the cruelest month, breeding,


194
00:24:49.563 --> 00:24:52.741
Lilacs out of
the dead land, mixing,


195
00:24:52.784 --> 00:24:55.352
Memory and desire, stirring,

196
00:24:55.395 --> 00:24:57.093
Dull roots with spring rain."

197
00:24:58.921 --> 00:25:00.966
Does he know who you are?

198
00:25:01.010 --> 00:25:04.753
He's dead.
And has been for a long time.


199
00:25:04.796 --> 00:25:06.885
He's writing
about the month of April.


200
00:25:08.234 --> 00:25:09.496
I'm happy he's dead.

201
00:25:11.716 --> 00:25:14.371
I want our kids
to know good poetry.


202
00:25:14.414 --> 00:25:16.068
That's why
you married a cop.


203
00:25:16.112 --> 00:25:17.417
A jealous cop.

204
00:25:18.810 --> 00:25:20.072
Close your eyes.

205
00:25:20.116 --> 00:25:21.291
Why?

206
00:25:21.334 --> 00:25:22.771
I'm gonna make you happy.

207
00:25:22.814 --> 00:25:24.773
Hmm. Close them.

208
00:25:24.816 --> 00:25:26.035
Okay.

209
00:25:30.648 --> 00:25:32.258
It's not gonna hurt, right? No.

210
00:25:34.347 --> 00:25:35.479
Open.

211
00:25:37.133 --> 00:25:39.875
Drink it quietly.
I am going to bed.


212
00:25:39.918 --> 00:25:42.355
Thank you.

213
00:25:46.142 --> 00:25:49.406
Did I ever tell you
that I love you?


214
00:25:49.449 --> 00:25:50.494
Yes, I know.

215
00:26:40.196 --> 00:26:41.501
What are you doing?

216
00:26:41.545 --> 00:26:43.547
Why are you following me, huh?

217
00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:46.724
Why?
Why are you following me?


218
00:26:47.203 --> 00:26:48.421
Huh?

219
00:26:48.465 --> 00:26:49.834
I don't understand you.

220
00:26:49.858 --> 00:26:51.816
Why? Who are...

221
00:27:05.221 --> 00:27:06.396
Signore.

222
00:27:06.439 --> 00:27:09.355
Excuse me, where's the police?

223
00:27:10.269 --> 00:27:11.444
Police?

224
00:27:11.488 --> 00:27:12.488
This way?

225
00:27:14.534 --> 00:27:15.884
Graziani!

226
00:27:17.276 --> 00:27:19.713
Graziani!
Yes, I'm coming.


227
00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:32.117
Do you speak English?

228
00:27:32.161 --> 00:27:33.771
Yes. Come, come.

229
00:27:33.814 --> 00:27:35.294
Mister Hakansson,
an old friend.


230
00:27:37.383 --> 00:27:38.645
Graziani.

231
00:27:38.689 --> 00:27:41.387
Ask him why
he came back to our city.


232
00:27:41.431 --> 00:27:43.951
He would like to know
why you came back in our city.


233
00:27:45.174 --> 00:27:47.959
Because Detective Laterza
called me


234
00:27:48.003 --> 00:27:49.874
and said he had some news
about the kidnapping.


235
00:27:56.054 --> 00:27:58.491
Laterza committed suicide.

236
00:28:02.408 --> 00:28:04.671
He says that he went crazy

237
00:28:04.715 --> 00:28:07.370
and started believing
in conspiracy theories.


238
00:28:10.895 --> 00:28:14.159
And he started reopening a
whole bunch of cases, including yours.


239
00:28:16.205 --> 00:28:18.685
So why did this kid
pull a gun on me today?


240
00:28:19.295 --> 00:28:20.470
Who?

241
00:28:20.513 --> 00:28:22.211
This young guy,
a 20-year-old guy,


242
00:28:22.254 --> 00:28:23.386
pulled a gun on me.

243
00:28:31.002 --> 00:28:33.222
He says he was
probably trying to rob you.


244
00:28:40.707 --> 00:28:43.275
He thinks that
your case is unsolved,


245
00:28:43.319 --> 00:28:45.190
and it's impossible to close it.

246
00:28:51.066 --> 00:28:53.677
Can I speak
to Detective Giordano?


247
00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:56.419
He was the one
who had my case originally.


248
00:28:56.462 --> 00:28:57.550
Giordano?

249
00:29:00.858 --> 00:29:02.991
Giordano took
a couple of days off.


250
00:29:09.562 --> 00:29:13.131
He says that he knows how you
feel, but he can't do anything for you.


251
00:29:21.748 --> 00:29:27.363
He says that he has
your fingerprints on an illegal gun.


252
00:29:31.889 --> 00:29:33.809
It's not good,
and you should leave.


253
00:29:38.852 --> 00:29:39.940
I'm sorry.

254
00:29:41.464 --> 00:29:42.464
Thanks.

255
00:29:43.161 --> 00:29:44.162
Nice to meet you.

256
00:29:48.471 --> 00:29:50.318
Would you tell
me what the fuck is going on?


257
00:29:50.342 --> 00:29:53.519
Ten years ago, they killed
his wife and daughter.


258
00:29:53.563 --> 00:29:56.044
So he comes back after ten years,
and we do nothing to help him?


259
00:29:56.087 --> 00:29:58.655
Graziani. We didn't manage to
close the case ten years ago.


260
00:29:58.698 --> 00:30:00.483
You think you can solve it now?

261
00:30:00.526 --> 00:30:02.963
Who do you think you are?
Sherlock Holmes? Go back to work.


262
00:30:03.007 --> 00:30:04.367
Yeah, I get it,
but the poor guy...


263
00:30:13.278 --> 00:30:14.323
Shit.

264
00:30:17.761 --> 00:30:18.675
Hey, honey.

265
00:30:18.718 --> 00:30:19.850
Hey.

266
00:30:19.893 --> 00:30:21.069
Smells delicious.

267
00:30:21.112 --> 00:30:22.635
Another exciting day
at the office?


268
00:30:23.723 --> 00:30:26.117
Kind of.

269
00:30:26.161 --> 00:30:28.641
I learned how to cook
a new dish.


270
00:30:28.685 --> 00:30:30.991
Oh, my God.
Should I start worrying?


271
00:30:31.035 --> 00:30:32.558
No.

272
00:30:49.532 --> 00:30:50.707
Are you coming?

273
00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:51.925
Yeah.

274
00:30:51.969 --> 00:30:53.013
Yeah, give me a second.

275
00:31:00.934 --> 00:31:01.979
Hey. You want water?

276
00:31:02.632 --> 00:31:03.894
Yeah, thank you.

277
00:31:03.937 --> 00:31:05.113
Hey.Hi.

278
00:31:08.725 --> 00:31:10.005
Did he see you?

279
00:31:14.774 --> 00:31:16.298
I asked if he saw you.

280
00:31:21.129 --> 00:31:22.826
I beg you, Lupo.

281
00:31:25.133 --> 00:31:26.351
What are you begging me for?

282
00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:30.320
Certainly you don't think
I'm going to kill you?


283
00:31:31.835 --> 00:31:33.489
You are like
a son to me.


284
00:31:35.317 --> 00:31:37.275
One who failed,

285
00:31:38.798 --> 00:31:40.017
but still, a son.

286
00:33:33.870 --> 00:33:35.219
Hey, are you all right?

287
00:34:30.187 --> 00:34:31.797
What the fuck?

288
00:34:35.801 --> 00:34:36.889
Yeah?

289
00:34:39.283 --> 00:34:40.893
Okay.

290
00:34:40.937 --> 00:34:41.937
Yes.

291
00:34:43.592 --> 00:34:44.680
Honey.

292
00:34:49.989 --> 00:34:51.817
What's happening?

293
00:34:51.861 --> 00:34:54.080
I'm sorry, honey.
It's something I have to do, okay?


294
00:34:55.691 --> 00:34:56.822
I gotta go.

295
00:35:08.921 --> 00:35:09.921
Take this.

296
00:35:13.883 --> 00:35:14.884
There's the new guy.

297
00:35:27.723 --> 00:35:29.246
New commissioner?

298
00:35:29.289 --> 00:35:30.397
Antonio Graziani,
a pleasure.


299
00:35:30.421 --> 00:35:31.421
Giordano.

300
00:35:34.947 --> 00:35:35.992
What a mess.

301
00:35:43.695 --> 00:35:44.957
Where
do we start from?


302
00:35:45.001 --> 00:35:46.394
Yeah, where
do we start from?


303
00:36:29.567 --> 00:36:32.135
Excuse me,
who did you rent it to?


304
00:36:32.178 --> 00:36:34.398
He was about 50,
a foreigner.


305
00:36:36.487 --> 00:36:37.706
Hakansson.

306
00:36:40.143 --> 00:36:41.492
Yeah, okay,
but what do I do now?


307
00:36:44.190 --> 00:36:45.365
Call the insurance company.

308
00:36:46.541 --> 00:36:47.803
Call the what?

309
00:36:49.065 --> 00:36:50.065
What now?

310
00:36:52.155 --> 00:36:53.286
Now it's war.

311
00:38:37.608 --> 00:38:38.957
Psst. Psst!

312
00:39:08.465 --> 00:39:10.075
Good evening.

313
00:39:10.119 --> 00:39:13.035
Sorry for the late hour.
We're looking for a thief.


314
00:39:13.078 --> 00:39:14.602
I didn't hear anything.

315
00:39:15.864 --> 00:39:17.169
All right.

316
00:39:17.213 --> 00:39:20.042
Call me if you see
anything suspicious.


317
00:39:20.085 --> 00:39:21.347
Sure.

318
00:39:21.391 --> 00:39:23.480
Thank you. Good night. Good night.

319
00:39:42.891 --> 00:39:44.011
Come in, please.

320
00:39:46.459 --> 00:39:47.504
Who are you?

321
00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:49.680
Ray Martin.

322
00:39:49.724 --> 00:39:52.596
I moved here from England
quite some time ago.


323
00:39:53.553 --> 00:39:55.120
Lovely town most of the time.

324
00:39:58.602 --> 00:39:59.602
Care for one?

325
00:40:01.823 --> 00:40:02.954
No, thanks.

326
00:40:02.998 --> 00:40:05.174
Oh, too bad.

327
00:40:05.217 --> 00:40:07.698
It's a wonderful brandy,
Mr. Hakansson.


328
00:40:09.134 --> 00:40:11.136
How do you know my name?

329
00:40:11.180 --> 00:40:15.401
Detective Laterza from downstairs
told me he'd called you.


330
00:40:16.968 --> 00:40:19.014
And I saw you yesterday
out on the street.


331
00:40:21.799 --> 00:40:23.540
I know what happened
to your family.


332
00:40:23.583 --> 00:40:24.583
I'm sorry.

333
00:40:25.498 --> 00:40:26.498
Sit down.

334
00:40:32.723 --> 00:40:34.464
He was a lovely chap.

335
00:40:34.507 --> 00:40:35.857
We became friends
over the years.


336
00:40:38.642 --> 00:40:41.645
He died that same night
when he called you.


337
00:40:43.038 --> 00:40:44.256
Suicide?

338
00:40:47.042 --> 00:40:48.173
Someone killed him.

339
00:40:50.915 --> 00:40:53.048
I'm glad you don't believe
in the official version.


340
00:40:54.049 --> 00:40:56.007
That makes two of us.

341
00:40:56.051 --> 00:40:58.793
Kind of hard to slash
your own throat.


342
00:40:58.836 --> 00:41:02.797
Laterza had a feeling he was
stepping into a hornet's nest.


343
00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:04.755
I asked him,
but he didn't want to tell me.


344
00:41:05.974 --> 00:41:08.454
At first,
I was a bit offended.


345
00:41:08.498 --> 00:41:09.738
I thought we were good friends.

346
00:41:11.370 --> 00:41:12.370
But now I get it.

347
00:41:13.285 --> 00:41:14.678
He was protecting me.

348
00:41:16.506 --> 00:41:17.594
From whom?

349
00:41:18.769 --> 00:41:19.988
The people who killed him.

350
00:41:21.816 --> 00:41:22.991
You need to be careful.

351
00:41:24.819 --> 00:41:26.168
It's kinda hard to live
your life


352
00:41:26.211 --> 00:41:27.952
without knowing
who killed your loved ones.


353
00:41:29.693 --> 00:41:30.781
Revenge?

354
00:41:35.481 --> 00:41:36.482
I don't know.

355
00:41:38.354 --> 00:41:39.354
Justice, maybe.

356
00:41:47.189 --> 00:41:48.189
Come with me.

357
00:41:55.893 --> 00:41:57.721
He put everything
he knew up here.


358
00:42:00.898 --> 00:42:02.538
FATAL ACCIDENT,
CAR SKIDS AND CATCHES FIRE


359
00:42:07.296 --> 00:42:08.645
Who's this guy?

360
00:42:09.820 --> 00:42:10.820
I don't know.

361
00:42:12.475 --> 00:42:17.175
Laterza always said no one could
be trusted in this village,


362
00:42:17.219 --> 00:42:19.656
not the local politicians,
not the police.


363
00:42:21.092 --> 00:42:22.398
Corruption is everywhere.

364
00:42:25.575 --> 00:42:27.446
I'll be in my apartment
if you need me.


365
00:42:27.490 --> 00:42:28.665
Thanks.

366
00:43:45.568 --> 00:43:47.048
Damn it.

367
00:45:13.569 --> 00:45:16.093
Get out of the car.
Get out. Get your hands up.


368
00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:19.488
Get out, slowly.

369
00:45:23.231 --> 00:45:24.884
Come forward. Forward.

370
00:45:26.756 --> 00:45:29.193
Two fingers, get your weapon out,
put it down.


371
00:45:29.237 --> 00:45:30.325
Slowly.

372
00:45:32.544 --> 00:45:34.024
I can tell you got it all wrong.

373
00:45:37.027 --> 00:45:38.681
I'm really sorry
for your family.


374
00:45:38.724 --> 00:45:40.639
Cell phone, take it out.

375
00:45:40.683 --> 00:45:42.946
Throw it down here. Quickly.

376
00:45:51.650 --> 00:45:52.738
Take your handcuffs out.

377
00:45:56.133 --> 00:45:57.395
Cuff yourself.

378
00:45:57.439 --> 00:45:59.180
You gotta be kidding. 
Cuff yourself.

379
00:46:00.485 --> 00:46:01.486
One hand.

380
00:46:10.365 --> 00:46:11.365
Where are we going?

381
00:46:12.889 --> 00:46:14.108
Where are we going?

382
00:46:14.151 --> 00:46:15.196
Let's go.

383
00:46:25.336 --> 00:46:27.991
Where are you taking me?
What do you want?


384
00:46:29.123 --> 00:46:31.212
Where are we going?

385
00:46:31.255 --> 00:46:32.996
I had nothing to do
with their kidnapping!


386
00:46:36.739 --> 00:46:37.739
I gotta go.

387
00:46:38.567 --> 00:46:40.612
My wife needs something.

388
00:46:40.656 --> 00:46:42.484
Call me for any emergency,
okay?


389
00:46:42.527 --> 00:46:43.528
Thanks.

390
00:46:52.363 --> 00:46:53.363
What?

391
00:46:58.456 --> 00:46:59.456
No.

392
00:47:08.249 --> 00:47:10.207
What? What do you want?

393
00:47:10.251 --> 00:47:12.253
I ask questions, you answer.

394
00:47:12.296 --> 00:47:13.341
What?

395
00:47:15.169 --> 00:47:16.735
Laterza.

396
00:47:16.779 --> 00:47:17.910
He knew too much,
right?


397
00:47:18.955 --> 00:47:20.565
That's why someone killed him.

398
00:47:20.609 --> 00:47:22.413
- I don't know what you're talking...
- Who killed him?


399
00:47:22.437 --> 00:47:23.957
I don't know
what you're talking about.


400
00:47:24.874 --> 00:47:26.876
I saw a picture of you and Lupo.

401
00:47:26.919 --> 00:47:28.269
Who is he?

402
00:47:28.312 --> 00:47:29.922
What's your connection to him?

403
00:47:29.966 --> 00:47:33.187
No Lupo's name came up
during the investigation, none!


404
00:47:33.230 --> 00:47:34.318
No.

405
00:47:37.234 --> 00:47:38.279
Last warning.

406
00:47:39.715 --> 00:47:40.716
Who is he?

407
00:47:44.937 --> 00:47:46.200
I don't...

408
00:47:58.168 --> 00:48:01.998
Fuck. Oh, fuck.

409
00:48:02.041 --> 00:48:03.347
What about the kidnappings?

410
00:48:04.914 --> 00:48:08.309
It's to finance his operation.
Drug smuggling.


411
00:48:10.093 --> 00:48:11.703
He alone
covers half of Italy.


412
00:48:11.747 --> 00:48:12.878
That's all.

413
00:48:15.664 --> 00:48:17.744
What about those men
who tried to kill me last night?


414
00:48:21.104 --> 00:48:22.824
You got here
in the wrong moment.


415
00:48:23.585 --> 00:48:25.804
Lupo is going to retire.

416
00:48:25.848 --> 00:48:29.068
He has this one
last operation.


417
00:48:32.507 --> 00:48:35.074
Enough to let this girl
disappear from San Gallo.


418
00:48:35.118 --> 00:48:36.119
San Gallo?

419
00:48:38.339 --> 00:48:39.731
San Gallo. Where is San Gallo?

420
00:48:42.778 --> 00:48:43.866
Where is San Gallo?

421
00:48:48.479 --> 00:48:51.178
Twenty-five kilometers
east on Route 34.


422
00:48:55.443 --> 00:48:56.792
I told you
everything I know.


423
00:48:58.837 --> 00:49:00.099
You let me go now.

424
00:49:03.712 --> 00:49:05.061
You let me go now!

425
00:49:07.890 --> 00:49:09.152
Come on!

426
00:49:09.196 --> 00:49:11.763
Come on,
you piece of shit!


427
00:49:12.590 --> 00:49:14.157
You let me go. Fuck!

428
00:49:15.550 --> 00:49:17.987
Fuck! Ah!

429
00:49:48.496 --> 00:49:51.150
Shit.

430
00:51:48.442 --> 00:51:50.792
Sarto, it's Giordano.

431
00:51:50.835 --> 00:51:52.054
No, don't ask me.

432
00:51:52.576 --> 00:51:53.576
Come.

433
00:51:54.665 --> 00:51:56.972
Come here, 26th Street.

434
00:52:17.601 --> 00:52:18.921
Do you know this man?

435
00:52:19.647 --> 00:52:20.952
Hey.

436
00:52:20.996 --> 00:52:22.650
Do you know this man?
It's important.


437
00:52:22.693 --> 00:52:24.260
Important to who?

438
00:52:26.958 --> 00:52:28.220
Let me ask you a question.

439
00:52:29.439 --> 00:52:31.136
Your neighbor,
Laterza.


440
00:52:32.573 --> 00:52:34.096
Did he commit suicide or not?

441
00:52:35.924 --> 00:52:37.142
Are you new here?

442
00:52:39.667 --> 00:52:41.277
I'm from Torino.

443
00:52:41.320 --> 00:52:44.019
And I think I should be the one
asking questions here.


444
00:52:45.237 --> 00:52:46.978
Not until
I know I can trust you.


445
00:52:49.416 --> 00:52:51.296
So you're telling me
you don't trust the police?


446
00:52:56.205 --> 00:52:58.686
It looks like we both walked
into a hornet's nest.


447
00:53:01.123 --> 00:53:03.168
Yeah.

448
00:53:03.212 --> 00:53:06.476
Listen, I've been doing
some research on my own and...


449
00:53:08.826 --> 00:53:09.827
this is what I got.

450
00:53:11.133 --> 00:53:12.253
Do you know what that means?

451
00:53:13.614 --> 00:53:15.790
It's a warning.

452
00:53:19.576 --> 00:53:20.708
A warning.

453
00:53:23.058 --> 00:53:24.146
I have a wife.

454
00:53:25.930 --> 00:53:28.672
And I'm about to become
a father. Twins.


455
00:53:31.762 --> 00:53:33.808
And I don't know what to do.

456
00:53:36.506 --> 00:53:38.029
Well, then you better
find Hakansson.


457
00:53:47.430 --> 00:53:48.430
Hello?

458
00:53:54.045 --> 00:53:55.525
The Albanians are moving.

459
00:53:57.005 --> 00:53:58.180
You know what to do.

460
00:54:07.581 --> 00:54:08.901
I can't believe this.

461
00:54:14.239 --> 00:54:15.893
I'm wondering
how he lived so long.


462
00:54:19.854 --> 00:54:20.898
He knew everything.

463
00:54:22.334 --> 00:54:23.727
He's headed here.

464
00:54:26.556 --> 00:54:27.862
San Gallo.

465
00:55:27.574 --> 00:55:28.694
Don't move.

466
00:55:31.012 --> 00:55:32.100
Don't move.

467
00:55:33.623 --> 00:55:34.929
Drop the rifle, slowly.

468
00:55:37.235 --> 00:55:38.235
Drop the rifle.

469
00:55:41.065 --> 00:55:42.065
Hands up.

470
00:55:43.285 --> 00:55:44.285
Hands up.

471
00:55:45.069 --> 00:55:46.114
Hands up.

472
00:56:23.934 --> 00:56:25.588
A bad wound.

473
00:56:25.632 --> 00:56:26.981
He should go
to the hospital.


474
00:56:27.024 --> 00:56:29.026
No,
you take care of him.


475
00:56:33.378 --> 00:56:34.641
Hey, honey.

476
00:56:34.684 --> 00:56:36.817
April,
I need to ask you a favor.


477
00:56:37.382 --> 00:56:38.688
Sure.

478
00:56:38.732 --> 00:56:41.256
Just do what
I'm about to tell you.


479
00:56:41.299 --> 00:56:43.214
I don't know if I can do that.

480
00:56:43.258 --> 00:56:45.390
Listen. Grab whatever
you need for the night


481
00:56:45.434 --> 00:56:47.697
and go to the address
I'm about to send you.


482
00:56:47.741 --> 00:56:50.101
I'll try to be there as quick as I can,
maybe in the morning.


483
00:56:50.439 --> 00:56:51.483
I...

484
00:56:53.660 --> 00:56:54.922
April.

485
00:56:54.965 --> 00:56:56.750
I'm
-I'm fine.

486
00:56:56.793 --> 00:56:58.708
Okay,
I'll explain everything when I get there.


487
00:56:59.666 --> 00:57:02.059
Sure. Antonio.

488
00:57:02.103 --> 00:57:03.800
The little ones need you.

489
00:57:03.844 --> 00:57:06.107
- I'm safe.
- I'm sorry.


490
00:57:06.150 --> 00:57:07.412
I'll send you the address.

491
00:57:09.327 --> 00:57:10.328
Okay, thank you.

492
00:57:10.372 --> 00:57:11.373
I love you.

493
00:57:12.287 --> 00:57:13.375
I love you, too.

494
00:57:27.041 --> 00:57:28.520
Number one is not answering.

495
00:57:29.783 --> 00:57:31.175
The Albanians are here.

496
00:57:32.394 --> 00:57:33.874
Send two men
to check it out.


497
00:58:55.259 --> 00:58:57.619
Say hi to your dad
and tell him to come get you.


498
00:59:29.206 --> 00:59:32.340
Say hi to your dad and
tell him to come get you.

499
00:59:32.383 --> 00:59:35.734
Dad, please come. Please, 
I can't hold on anymore.

500
00:59:35.778 --> 00:59:36.997
Bastard.

501
00:59:40.174 --> 00:59:41.958
Giordano. Giordano!

502
00:59:42.002 --> 00:59:44.004
Giordano, Maria.

503
00:59:44.047 --> 00:59:45.570
Maria, your daughter. Huh?

504
00:59:45.614 --> 00:59:47.181
They took her.
They know everything.


505
00:59:48.008 --> 00:59:49.836
Come on. Calm down.

506
00:59:49.879 --> 00:59:50.880
Huh?

507
01:00:05.025 --> 01:00:06.113
Giordano.

508
01:00:07.723 --> 01:00:09.203
I'm coming.

509
01:00:09.246 --> 01:00:10.378
I'll wait for you.

510
01:00:53.900 --> 01:00:55.118
Graziani?

511
01:00:55.162 --> 01:00:56.467
Yeah, my husband...

512
01:00:56.511 --> 01:00:58.295
I know. Come with me.

513
01:01:07.348 --> 01:01:08.697
What's going on?

514
01:01:08.740 --> 01:01:09.741
Sit down.

515
01:01:13.049 --> 01:01:14.964
Some tea? Yeah.

516
01:01:16.313 --> 01:01:17.619
I hate it when he does this.

517
01:01:18.402 --> 01:01:19.447
He keeps secrets.

518
01:01:20.709 --> 01:01:21.797
I'm his wife.

519
01:01:23.364 --> 01:01:26.062
- How am I supposed to trust him?
- He does it out of love.


520
01:02:21.378 --> 01:02:23.728
Giordano, go easy on those...

521
01:02:25.208 --> 01:02:26.208
or your heart will blow.

522
01:03:14.910 --> 01:03:16.070
Police!

523
01:03:22.396 --> 01:03:23.556
Put the gun down!

524
01:03:25.225 --> 01:03:28.619
Detective Graziani,
we met last night at the police station.


525
01:03:30.882 --> 01:03:32.275
I remember.

526
01:03:32.319 --> 01:03:34.016
What are you doing here?

527
01:03:34.060 --> 01:03:37.585
Look, I know everything about
Lupo, Giordano and Sartori.


528
01:03:38.716 --> 01:03:39.916
I'm putting my gun away, okay?

529
01:03:43.634 --> 01:03:44.634
Don't shoot.

530
01:03:50.728 --> 01:03:52.295
Okay, I'm coming down.

531
01:03:52.339 --> 01:03:56.125
Look, there's no point for you
in seeking for revenge.


532
01:03:56.908 --> 01:03:58.258
Oh, my God.

533
01:04:01.870 --> 01:04:03.306
Look, there's too many of them.

534
01:04:03.350 --> 01:04:04.873
We gotta get out of here,
okay? Now.


535
01:04:04.916 --> 01:04:06.004
I gotta go.

536
01:04:07.832 --> 01:04:10.008
I know about your family.
I'm sorry, man.


537
01:04:11.967 --> 01:04:13.708
Shit.

538
01:04:13.751 --> 01:04:14.796
All right.

539
01:05:00.885 --> 01:05:02.148
Bastards.

540
01:05:03.236 --> 01:05:04.976
It's incredible.

541
01:05:05.020 --> 01:05:07.180
Now they're all here,
it's gonna be difficult to get in.


542
01:05:09.546 --> 01:05:10.634
Let me try something.

543
01:05:20.775 --> 01:05:24.213
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
I'm with Sartori and Giordano.


544
01:05:24.257 --> 01:05:26.346
I'm a policeman, too.

545
01:05:26.389 --> 01:05:28.696
Put the gun down.
You can simply ask them. Go ask them.


546
01:05:29.436 --> 01:05:30.436
Come on.

547
01:06:21.009 --> 01:06:22.009
Lupo.

548
01:06:29.670 --> 01:06:30.758
Bravo.

549
01:06:34.501 --> 01:06:35.632
Where's my daughter?

550
01:06:38.287 --> 01:06:39.287
Where's my daughter?

551
01:06:47.949 --> 01:06:50.449
Say hi to your dad and
tell him to come get you.

552
01:06:50.473 --> 01:06:53.104
Dad, please come. Please, 
I can't hold on anymore.

553
01:06:53.128 --> 01:06:54.260
Take me to my daughter.

554
01:06:55.130 --> 01:06:56.392
Take me to my daughter!

555
01:06:59.177 --> 01:07:00.266
The Albanians.

556
01:07:03.878 --> 01:07:05.009
Leotrim.

557
01:07:06.620 --> 01:07:08.274
Leotrim.

558
01:07:19.937 --> 01:07:20.895
Hello?

559
01:07:20.938 --> 01:07:22.113
Giordano.

560
01:07:23.419 --> 01:07:25.508
Abort everything.

561
01:07:25.552 --> 01:07:27.118
Abort everything!

562
01:07:28.163 --> 01:07:30.165
Hello?

563
01:07:36.606 --> 01:07:37.825
Take me to my daughter.

564
01:07:44.397 --> 01:07:46.573
- You okay?
- Yeah.


565
01:07:46.616 --> 01:07:47.922
That was close. Thanks.

566
01:07:49.619 --> 01:07:50.707
You're gonna need stitches.

567
01:07:50.751 --> 01:07:51.751
Thanks.

568
01:07:58.149 --> 01:08:01.849
We're gonna have to go up and around
to the other side to get to the girl.


569
01:08:01.892 --> 01:08:03.024
All right.

570
01:08:03.894 --> 01:08:05.026
After you.

571
01:08:51.028 --> 01:08:52.028
Holy shit!

572
01:08:52.856 --> 01:08:53.856
Good job.

573
01:08:55.076 --> 01:08:56.425
Get the radio.Yeah.

574
01:09:08.437 --> 01:09:09.437
Let's go.

575
01:09:37.814 --> 01:09:39.947
Hey, look.
That's Giordano and Sartori.


576
01:09:42.863 --> 01:09:44.168
They've taken her down there.

577
01:09:44.212 --> 01:09:45.212
Yeah.

578
01:09:49.086 --> 01:09:50.392
Oh, shit.

579
01:09:50.436 --> 01:09:52.036
We gotta get outta here. 
Okay, let's go.

580
01:09:59.662 --> 01:10:01.359
Okay.

581
01:10:01.403 --> 01:10:03.231
Do what you can
from up here.


582
01:10:03.274 --> 01:10:05.252
Try to cover me.
I'm gonna go round the back, get the girl.


583
01:10:05.276 --> 01:10:06.321
All right.

584
01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:43.489
Shit.

585
01:11:08.252 --> 01:11:09.384
Fuck.

586
01:11:51.034 --> 01:11:54.298
God.

587
01:12:21.935 --> 01:12:22.936
Martin.

588
01:12:26.330 --> 01:12:27.418
The babies are coming.

589
01:15:13.062 --> 01:15:14.063
On the roof.

590
01:15:20.809 --> 01:15:22.637
On the roof. On the roof!

591
01:16:31.924 --> 01:16:34.100
No, leave me! Leave me!

592
01:16:39.845 --> 01:16:41.107
Stay away.

593
01:17:04.217 --> 01:17:07.176
It was an accident.

594
01:17:07.220 --> 01:17:09.048
Believe me,
just an accident.


595
01:17:09.875 --> 01:17:12.225
I
-I didn't want...

596
01:17:12.268 --> 01:17:14.096
I didn't want...
It's not my fault.


597
01:17:14.140 --> 01:17:15.881
It's not my fault.

598
01:17:15.924 --> 01:17:17.534
I
-I didn't want.

599
01:17:19.493 --> 01:17:21.495
This is not my fault,
believe me.


600
01:18:10.587 --> 01:18:11.587
You lose.

601
01:18:32.087 --> 01:18:34.046
What's her name? Maria.

602
01:18:34.089 --> 01:18:36.831
Maria. It's okay, come on.

603
01:18:36.874 --> 01:18:39.790
Maria.
Come, I'm a police officer. Don't worry.


604
01:18:39.834 --> 01:18:41.514
Come on. It's okay.

605
01:18:43.620 --> 01:18:47.015
All right, come on. Don't worry.
Don't worry. It's okay.


606
01:18:47.059 --> 01:18:48.147
It's okay, it's okay.

607
01:19:02.944 --> 01:19:04.400
Where's my father?

608
01:19:04.424 --> 01:19:06.034
This way. Come with us.

609
01:19:06.078 --> 01:19:07.278
Come on. Let's go.

610
01:19:13.520 --> 01:19:14.521
I'll take these.

611
01:19:16.044 --> 01:19:17.132
There's your dad.

612
01:19:19.352 --> 01:19:20.614
Dad?

613
01:19:20.657 --> 01:19:22.398
Dad.Maria.

614
01:19:30.406 --> 01:19:32.930
I made a mistake.

615
01:19:32.974 --> 01:19:35.629
Dad... I made a mistake, honey.

616
01:20:21.414 --> 01:20:22.415
Hey.

617
01:20:23.851 --> 01:20:26.201
All cleaned up, all set.

618
01:20:26.245 --> 01:20:28.551
You're free to go.Thanks.

619
01:20:28.595 --> 01:20:30.466
Oh, by the way,
Giordano...


620
01:20:30.510 --> 01:20:33.904
He recovered enough
to end up in front of a court


621
01:20:33.948 --> 01:20:36.348
and probably the judge is gonna
take care of everything, so...


622
01:20:38.300 --> 01:20:40.998
Well, it was good work,
Detective.


623
01:20:41.042 --> 01:20:42.042
Thank you.

624
01:20:43.392 --> 01:20:46.134
Oh, yeah.
Uh, your newborns.


625
01:20:46.178 --> 01:20:49.355
My kids. Wait,
I gotta show you a picture.


626
01:20:49.398 --> 01:20:51.096
Mmm. They're growing fast.

627
01:20:53.837 --> 01:20:56.120
And I guess we can say they're
gonna grow up in a better world.


628
01:20:56.144 --> 01:20:57.624
Thanks to us.

629
01:20:57.667 --> 01:20:59.278
Yeah, let's hope so.Yeah.

630
01:21:01.584 --> 01:21:02.803
All right, well...

631
01:21:05.806 --> 01:21:06.981
Thanks for everything.

632
01:21:08.417 --> 01:21:09.810
You have my number.

633
01:21:09.853 --> 01:21:11.551
Anything you need,
just give me a call.


634
01:21:11.594 --> 01:21:12.594
Will do.

635
01:21:17.905 --> 01:21:18.993
Hakansson.

636
01:21:24.216 --> 01:21:25.456
Come and visit once in a while.

637
01:21:26.305 --> 01:21:27.306
We're gonna miss you.

638
01:21:29.221 --> 01:21:30.265
Yeah.

639
01:21:54.855 --> 01:21:57.095
There's no joy or
sorrow for what we just did.


640
01:22:00.687 --> 01:22:04.038
All I remember is a boy walking
in his father's footsteps.


641
01:22:09.391 --> 01:22:10.392
I stopped.

642
01:22:11.698 --> 01:22:14.135
I looked up at the sky.

643
01:22:14.179 --> 01:22:18.748
And I knew the tracker,
the hunter and its prey...


644
01:22:19.793 --> 01:22:21.142
all live inside me.
