wanna go that way.

make it here,

about putting a sign up on the roof.

still planes in the air.

from Case Hardware.

to board up the weak spots.

up that mess you made in Metropolis?

easy. Shut your fucking mouth.

Get the gun
outta my face.


471
00:41:32.718 --> 00:41:35.303
You can't just turn them
away, C.J. You'll kill them.


472
00:41:35.386 --> 00:41:37.389
Tough shit. Self-defense.

473
00:41:39.432 --> 00:41:40.474
I'm not killing anybody.

474
00:41:40.558 --> 00:41:41.642
You know what?
I'll kill you.


475
00:41:41.725 --> 00:41:43.352
No, no, stop it, C.J.
Don't do this!


476
00:41:43.436 --> 00:41:44.813
Shut up!

477
00:41:45.271 --> 00:41:47.856
I'll kill each and every one of
you to stay alive. You hear me?


478
00:41:47.940 --> 00:41:50.359
I said get the fucking gun
outta my face!

You got quite
a mouth on you.


480
00:41:52.528 --> 00:41:54.904
Somebody should show her
how to use it.


481
00:42:01.413 --> 00:42:03.872
Is there a holding
cell in there?


482
00:42:03.957 --> 00:42:06.291
Yeah, back
of the security room.


483
00:42:06.458 --> 00:42:07.709
That's real good, man.

484

all killed, dumbass.

a good plan.

Can't see a damn thing. Me neither.

491
00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:51.960
Why's he backing up the truck?

492
00:43:02.012 --> 00:43:03.679
Through here!
Hey!

00:43:09.311 --> 00:43:12.606
Fuck. We gotta go out there.

Man, you better throw that
bullshit right out your head.


496
00:43:14.858 --> 00:43:17.568
I'm not going back out there.
That's not part of the plan.


497
00:43:17.652 --> 00:43:19.863
Change of plan.
I'm gonna open the door.

No.
Okay.

No. Don't do it, man.

to collect myself, okay?

there, I'll take a look at your leg.

00:44:36.562 --> 00:44:39.522
Here. I'll hold this.
Just go and wait there.

00:44:51.284 --> 00:44:53.994
from the same jackass who
told us to go to St. Verbena?

The church downtown?
Yeah.


529
00:44:55.872 --> 00:44:59.667
That's the first place I went. Some
dipshit on the radio said it was safe there.


530
00:44:59.750 --> 00:45:02.920
He was wrong. Is that
where you picked them up?


531
00:45:03.379 --> 00:45:05.464
Well, I get this call on
the C.B. From that guy Glen


532
00:45:05.547 --> 00:45:09.008
saying all these folks
are in the chapel.


533
00:45:09.092 --> 00:45:11.802
He's a priest?
No, he plays the organ.


534
00:45:12.178 --> 00:45:15.224
I was in the neighborhood,
so I picked them up.

to Fort Pastor.

is fucked, man. Bloodbath city.

Is everyone there dead?

Yeah, in the sense
that they all, sort of,

fell down, and then...
I gotta look for myself.

...got up and...

I'll get as far as I can. Right now
it's about one foot out that door.

with a fever.

pretty bad over there.

check it out.

much at all.

more than I could.

pretty bad.

clean it up a bit.

I think it's the bites.

589
00:49:55.910 --> 00:49:56.994
Frank said she was
walking on her own


590
00:49:57.078 --> 00:50:00.247
when she got in the truck
five hours ago.


591
00:50:00.331 --> 00:50:03.335
The bites killed her.
The bites brought her back.


592
00:50:03.418 --> 00:50:05.670
How do you know?
I watched it happen.


593
00:50:05.753 --> 00:50:08.006
I felt her pulse.
She was gone.


594
00:50:08.090 --> 00:50:12.051
Then... Yesterday I saw the same
thing happen to somebody else.


595
00:50:14.387 --> 00:50:16.973
I think that's why
it spread so fast.


596
00:50:19.100 --> 00:50:20.435
All right.

597
00:50:23.645 --> 00:50:26.147
So who else
in the group is bitten?


598
00:50:26.272 --> 00:50:27.358
Frank, for sure.

599
00:50:27.441 --> 00:50:29.276
How about the one
with the foot?


600
00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:31.486
Tucker?
He says no, he fell.


601
00:50:32.362 --> 00:50:34.699
So, it's Frank.
Tall guy, right?


602
00:50:35.074 --> 00:50:37.951
Right. So we have to
quarantine him right away.


603
00:50:38.034 --> 00:50:40.037
Where exactly do we do that?

604
00:50:40.121 --> 00:50:42.248
I don't know. There must be
someplace to keep him in here.


605
00:50:42.331 --> 00:50:43.665
Then what?

606
00:50:45.124 --> 00:50:46.918
I don't know, but...

607
00:50:47.669 --> 00:50:50.380
It's too dangerous
to keep him on here.


608
00:50:53.926 --> 00:50:55.844
I'm sorry. What are we
talking about here?


609
00:50:55.927 --> 00:50:57.721
Are we talking
about killing him?


610
00:50:57.804 --> 00:50:59.223
Would you rather
we waited for him to die,


611
00:50:59.306 --> 00:51:00.765
and then he tries
to kill us?


612
00:51:00.807 --> 00:51:03.059
Yes. No. You can't kill him. Ana...

613
00:51:03.142 --> 00:51:05.479
He's got a daughter!
I'm sorry.


614
00:51:07.480 --> 00:51:09.315
I don't think
there's any other choice.


615
00:51:12.110 --> 00:51:13.486
He's right.

616
00:51:16.029 --> 00:51:18.241
Michael, you can't do this.
What if I'm wrong?


617
00:51:18.324 --> 00:51:20.493
You've seen it
happen before.


618
00:51:24.203 --> 00:51:25.497
Frank,

619
00:51:26.498 --> 00:51:28.750
Michael's coming
to shoot you.


620
00:51:29.166 --> 00:51:31.003
What are you talking about?

621
00:51:31.086 --> 00:51:34.296
You're infected. You're
gonna become one of them.


622
