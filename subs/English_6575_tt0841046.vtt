1
00:00:51.157 --> 00:00:52.522
Mr. Cox?

2
00:00:53.326 --> 00:00:55.191
Mr. Cox?

3
00:00:56.663 --> 00:00:58.392
Mr. Cox?

4
00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.129
Guys, I need Cox.

5
00:01:03.836 --> 00:01:07.363
He goes on in two minutes
and I can't find him.


6
00:01:11.678 --> 00:01:13.236
Mr. Cox.

7
00:01:15.415 --> 00:01:17.315
Mr. Cox?

8
00:01:17.817 --> 00:01:20.513
You're gonna have to give him
a moment, son.


9
00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.282
Dewey Cox needs to think about
his entire life before he plays.


10
00:01:53.987 --> 00:01:55.784
Come on, Nate, let's go play.

11
00:01:55.989 --> 00:01:58.219
I can't, Dewey. 
I gotta practice.

12
00:01:58.424 --> 00:02:02.224
You can't practice all the time, Nate.
You're already perfect.


13
00:02:02.428 --> 00:02:05.056
All right. Come on, Dewey,
let's go play!.


14
00:02:05.265 --> 00:02:07.631
- Today's gonna be the best day ever!.
- Yeah!


15
00:02:07.834 --> 00:02:10.564
Ain't nothing horrible
gonna happen today.


16
00:02:12.272 --> 00:02:14.297
What do you wanna be
when you grow up, Dewey?


17
00:02:14.507 --> 00:02:17.203
I don't know. Never really
thunk about it before.


18
00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.072
When I grow up,
I'm gonna be a great composer.


19
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.214
And a professional baseball player.

20
00:02:22.415 --> 00:02:26.249
Then I'm gonna be an astronaut,
and I'm gonna go to the moon.


21
00:02:26.452 --> 00:02:29.319
There's nothing I won't do
with this long, long life of mine.


22
00:02:29.722 --> 00:02:30.848
For sure.

23
00:02:31.057 --> 00:02:34.788
That's what's great about being young.
So much time to do great things.


24
00:02:34.994 --> 00:02:37.019
Let's go play!

25
00:02:42.635 --> 00:02:44.034
My turn!

26
00:02:48.508 --> 00:02:50.442
I got him! I got him!

27
00:02:50.643 --> 00:02:51.701
Catch!

28
00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.345
Chicken!

29
00:03:15.034 --> 00:03:17.195
I challenge you to a duel, sir.

30
00:03:17.403 --> 00:03:18.665
I don't know, Nate.

31
00:03:18.871 --> 00:03:21.704
You know how mad Pa gets
when we play with his machetes.


32
00:03:21.908 --> 00:03:25.002
Come on. There's nothing wrong
with a little machete-fighting.


33
00:03:25.211 --> 00:03:27.509
Now, en garde!

34
00:03:30.817 --> 00:03:33.217
- Do you yield, sir?
- Never!


35
00:03:35.922 --> 00:03:37.685
Prepare to meet your maker.

36
00:03:46.566 --> 00:03:48.727
- Dewey!
- Nate!


37
00:03:50.403 --> 00:03:51.529
I'm halved!

38
00:03:51.738 --> 00:03:53.399
Oh, we should've listened to Pa.

39
00:03:53.606 --> 00:03:55.631
Dewey, I'm cut in half pretty bad.

40
00:03:56.509 --> 00:04:00.502
In case I don't make it,
then you'll have to be double great...


41
00:04:00.713 --> 00:04:02.203
...for the both of us.

42
00:04:02.515 --> 00:04:04.608
Wow, that's a lot of pressure, Nate.

43
00:04:04.817 --> 00:04:07.183
You can handle it, Dewey.
Now, run, get Pa!


44
00:04:11.724 --> 00:04:13.055
Holy shit.

45
00:04:17.196 --> 00:04:21.758
This was a particularly bad case
of somebody being cut in half.


46
00:04:22.335 --> 00:04:27.272
I was not able to reattach
the top half of his body...


47
00:04:27.473 --> 00:04:29.304
...to the bottom half of his body.

48
00:04:29.675 --> 00:04:33.076
Speak English, doc!
We ain't scientists.


49
00:04:33.446 --> 00:04:35.380
I'm sorry, folks. He's gone.

50
00:04:35.581 --> 00:04:37.139
Oh, no!

51
00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:38.715
Oh, my God.

52
00:04:38.918 --> 00:04:41.182
Dear God. Oh, Dewey.

53
00:04:41.387 --> 00:04:43.150
It's all your fault, Dewey Cox.

54
00:04:43.356 --> 00:04:46.519
Oh, Pa, you don't mean that.
It's not his fault.


55
00:04:47.927 --> 00:04:50.020
He cut him in half with a machete.

56
00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:51.287
No.

57
00:04:51.497 --> 00:04:54.295
You. You're not half the boy
that Nate was.


58
00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.469
You're not even half the boy
that the top half of Nate was...


59
00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:59.433
...after you cut him in half.

60
00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:03.370
So you're saying I'm less than
a quarter of the boy Nate was?


61
00:05:04.544 --> 00:05:07.069
The wrong kid died.

62
00:05:09.816 --> 00:05:11.681
Ma, I can't smell anything.

63
00:05:13.052 --> 00:05:14.781
You can't smell anything?

64
00:05:15.121 --> 00:05:17.453
I think I lost my sense of smell.

65
00:05:17.657 --> 00:05:19.989
You gone smell-blind, son.

66
00:05:21.661 --> 00:05:23.788
It'll pass, Dewey.

67
00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:27.463
Now, you run on down to the country
store and get us some butter.


68
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.228
And a candle.

69
00:05:31.037 --> 00:05:33.801
We're gonna light us
a candle tonight.


70
00:05:45.751 --> 00:05:47.548
I'm a gamblin' man

71
00:05:48.921 --> 00:05:51.014
I gambled everywhere I go

72
00:05:53.326 --> 00:05:55.385
Lord, I'm a gamblin' man

73
00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:00.365
Gambled everywhere I go

74
00:06:04.637 --> 00:06:06.070
I'm a gamblin' man

75
00:06:08.474 --> 00:06:11.136
Lord, I gambled from door to door

76
00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:37.201
I've never heard no music
like that before.


77
00:06:37.403 --> 00:06:39.268
It's so sad.

78
00:06:39.472 --> 00:06:41.497
That's why it's called the blues, boy.

79
00:06:42.041 --> 00:06:44.271
I think I'd like to play me
some blues.


80
00:06:44.477 --> 00:06:49.005
Ain't no 6-year-old boy understand
the true meaning of the blues.


81
00:06:49.215 --> 00:06:51.274
I reckon I might.

82
00:06:51.684 --> 00:06:53.151
You play the guitar?

83
00:06:53.352 --> 00:06:56.446
Never have before.
But I'm a real fast learner.


84
00:06:56.656 --> 00:06:58.248
Well, go ahead.

85
00:07:01.661 --> 00:07:06.064
You put your finger right up there.
Place your hands here. That's it.


86
00:07:06.265 --> 00:07:07.391
That's the G chord.

87
00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.961
Now hit the strings
with your other hand.


88
00:07:16.108 --> 00:07:17.541
- That's it.
- There you go.


89
00:07:25.851 --> 00:07:27.318
That ain't bad.

90
00:07:30.156 --> 00:07:34.115
I done a bad thing

91
00:07:35.861 --> 00:07:39.319
Cut my brother in half

92
00:07:44.437 --> 00:07:48.567
I done a bad, bad thing

93
00:07:50.242 --> 00:07:53.678
Cut my brother in half

94
00:07:59.952 --> 00:08:03.911
My mama's gonna cry

95
00:08:04.523 --> 00:08:09.654
Somewhere the devil's havin' a laugh

96
00:08:12.131 --> 00:08:13.826
It's not bad for your first time.

97
00:08:14.934 --> 00:08:18.028
You can do it, Dewey.
You'll be double great.


98
00:08:18.237 --> 00:08:20.228
For the both of us.

99
00:08:33.552 --> 00:08:35.247
Dewey?

100
00:08:37.056 --> 00:08:39.183
Dewey.

101
00:08:41.327 --> 00:08:42.885
Dewey?

102
00:08:43.629 --> 00:08:45.119
Mama, you made it!

103
00:08:45.331 --> 00:08:47.822
There's my favorite 14-year-old son.

104
00:08:49.035 --> 00:08:51.697
Oh, no. Come on, now.
Not in front of the fellas.


105
00:08:51.904 --> 00:08:52.962
Howdy, boys.

106
00:08:53.172 --> 00:08:54.901
Howdy, Mrs. Cox.

107
00:08:55.107 --> 00:08:56.597
I just wanted to say break a leg.

108
00:08:56.809 --> 00:08:59.175
I know you boys are gonna
play a real good song.


109
00:08:59.378 --> 00:09:00.606
Oh, thanks, Ma.

110
00:09:00.813 --> 00:09:04.214
I'm just so proud you learned to play
the guitar so good.


111
00:09:05.184 --> 00:09:07.175
Without even having
a sense of smell.


112
00:09:07.386 --> 00:09:10.287
It's all right now, Mama.
I learned how to play by ear.


113
00:09:10.489 --> 00:09:12.582
You just go out there
and sing your heart out.


114
00:09:12.792 --> 00:09:14.555
I will, Mama.

115
00:09:15.561 --> 00:09:18.894
I don't know what we're doing here
at this high school talent show.


116
00:09:19.098 --> 00:09:22.124
We're here to see our boy,
that's what we're doing here.


117
00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:26.163
You all right, ma'am?

118
00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:30.071
I'm fine.

119
00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:32.810
Just my vertigo acting up again.

120
00:09:33.012 --> 00:09:36.072
- What's vertigo?
- Just a little dizziness is all.


121
00:09:37.616 --> 00:09:40.141
Ain't nothing terrible
ever came from no dizziness.


122
00:09:40.653 --> 00:09:42.621
Testing, testing.

123
00:09:42.822 --> 00:09:45.347
Crawdad, crawdad.

124
00:09:46.358 --> 00:09:49.816
Hello, everybody.
Welcome to the annual talent show.


125
00:09:50.029 --> 00:09:55.331
We're gonna get this going here with
the juggling talents of Johnny McGraw.


126
00:10:19.358 --> 00:10:21.588
- How we gonna follow that?
- Delilah Montgomery.


127
00:10:21.794 --> 00:10:24.160
- Delilah Montgomery.
- Very nice!


128
00:10:25.831 --> 00:10:28.595
And now sophomore Dewey Cox
is gonna sing us a song.


129
00:10:28.801 --> 00:10:30.598
So, ladies and germs...

130
00:10:32.671 --> 00:10:34.366
I know, I know.

131
00:10:34.573 --> 00:10:38.441
Please welcome Dewey Cox
and the Dewey Cox Four.


132
00:10:49.755 --> 00:10:51.814
Hi. My name's Dewey Cox.

133
00:10:52.024 --> 00:10:55.482
And this is a little song I wrote called
"Take My Hand. "


134
00:10:55.694 --> 00:10:57.059
I sure hope you like it.

135
00:10:57.263 --> 00:11:00.460
The wrong kid died, goddamn it.

136
00:11:05.471 --> 00:11:08.406
- Take
- Take, take


137
00:11:08.607 --> 00:11:10.541
Take my hand

138
00:11:10.743 --> 00:11:11.903
Take my hand

139
00:11:12.111 --> 00:11:14.545
We're gonna walk through the park

140
00:11:15.714 --> 00:11:20.117
I promise to have you
Home before dark


141
00:11:20.586 --> 00:11:22.520
Home before dark

142
00:11:22.721 --> 00:11:25.690
Oh, life would be so sweet

143
00:11:26.292 --> 00:11:29.352
Walking with you down the street

144
00:11:30.462 --> 00:11:32.362
This music is an outrage!

145
00:11:32.832 --> 00:11:34.857
Come on and take my hand

146
00:11:35.067 --> 00:11:36.796
Come on and take my hand

147
00:11:37.002 --> 00:11:39.061
It's the devil's music!

148
00:11:39.271 --> 00:11:42.729
It's all right if you're coy

149
00:11:42.942 --> 00:11:46.810
After all I'm a boy

150
00:11:47.012 --> 00:11:48.479
And you're a girl

151
00:11:48.681 --> 00:11:50.876
But make no mistake

152
00:11:51.217 --> 00:11:54.653
Yours is the hand
I want to take


153
00:11:54.854 --> 00:11:56.446
So please

154
00:11:56.655 --> 00:11:58.646
So please, please

155
00:11:58.858 --> 00:12:00.758
Take my hand

156
00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:02.154
You're going to hell!

157
00:12:02.628 --> 00:12:04.823
Blasphemer!

158
00:12:08.934 --> 00:12:11.732
That's it. I want you
out of this house, boy.


159
00:12:11.937 --> 00:12:14.337
- Pa!
- You heard the preacher.


160
00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:17.065
You think we don't know
what you're talking about...


161
00:12:17.276 --> 00:12:18.709
...when you say "take my hand"?

162
00:12:18.911 --> 00:12:20.503
What? It's about holding hands.

163
00:12:20.713 --> 00:12:21.702
You watch your mouth.

164
00:12:21.914 --> 00:12:24.974
You know who's got hands?
The devil.


165
00:12:25.184 --> 00:12:27.209
And he uses them for holding.

166
00:12:28.654 --> 00:12:31.623
I ain't got no room in my house
for no devil's spawn.


167
00:12:31.824 --> 00:12:36.124
Be careful. Before you say something
you regret for the rest of your days.


168
00:12:36.328 --> 00:12:38.888
Like what?
Like "the wrong kid died"?


169
00:12:39.098 --> 00:12:40.190
Oh, no! No!

170
00:12:40.399 --> 00:12:43.266
It's okay.
It's okay, Mama, settle down.


171
00:12:43.535 --> 00:12:45.264
Pa's right.

172
00:12:46.138 --> 00:12:49.266
Springberry ain't big enough
for me no more.


173
00:12:49.708 --> 00:12:52.268
I reckon it's time for Dewey Cox
to move on.


174
00:12:53.212 --> 00:12:55.237
But you're only 14.

175
00:12:55.447 --> 00:12:57.881
Mama, I love you.

176
00:12:58.417 --> 00:13:01.079
But I don't need nobody.

177
00:13:01.754 --> 00:13:03.415
All I need is my music.

178
00:13:04.223 --> 00:13:07.124
I seen my path today,
and I'm gonna take it.


179
00:13:07.326 --> 00:13:10.784
And someday,
I'll make my masterpiece...


180
00:13:10.996 --> 00:13:13.726
...and you'll all be proud of me.

181
00:13:13.933 --> 00:13:15.628
Just like you were of Nate.

182
00:13:16.168 --> 00:13:18.033
Can I come, Dewey?

183
00:13:18.237 --> 00:13:20.899
Of course you can, Edith.
You're my girlfriend.


184
00:13:21.106 --> 00:13:22.630
- I am?
- Yeah, silly.


185
00:13:22.841 --> 00:13:25.071
I pointed at you in the audience.

186
00:13:25.844 --> 00:13:29.837
Did you hear that?
I'm Dewey's 12-year-old girlfriend!


187
00:13:30.049 --> 00:13:32.813
You're the most talented man
I've ever seen in my whole life.


188
00:13:33.018 --> 00:13:36.749
And you will never get anything
but love and support from me...


189
00:13:36.956 --> 00:13:39.823
...for you and your dreams
the rest of my life.


190
00:13:40.025 --> 00:13:43.256
Well, then, go on.
Get out of this house.


191
00:13:43.462 --> 00:13:47.831
Before I cut your dreams in half
like you cut mine in half.


192
00:13:48.033 --> 00:13:49.933
Goodbye, Pa.

193
00:13:50.602 --> 00:13:53.969
Just wait till you see
what happens now.


194
00:13:56.775 --> 00:13:58.436
Here we go.

195
00:13:59.778 --> 00:14:02.246
Ma and Pa leave home
All the kids get glad


196
00:14:02.448 --> 00:14:04.279
You know our house's
Gonna jump like mad


197

203
00:14:22.768 --> 00:14:24.895

00:14:32.911 --> 00:14:35.880
That's a sexy look right there.

205
00:14:36.582 --> 00:14:38.607
Oh, I like it, I like it.

206
00:14:38.851 --> 00:14:41.081
Let's jump, jump, jump
Jump, jump, jump

211
00:14:52.164 --> 00:14:53.426
You know what I'm saying.

212
00:14:53.632 --> 00:14:56.430
We're gonna jump, li'I children
Mama and Papa's gone


213
00:14:56.635 --> 00:14:58.262
Let's take them home, fellas.

214
00:14:58.470 --> 00:15:02.634
We're gonna jump, li'I children
Mama and Papa's gone


215
00:15:04.977 --> 00:15:06.706
Yeah, baby. Wrap it up right there.

216
00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:09.611
I'm gonna take one of them
home tonight.


217
00:15:09.815 --> 00:15:12.283
My name is Bobby Shad
and these are the Bad Men.


218
00:15:12.484 --> 00:15:14.645
We gonna take a break,
then we be right back...


219
00:15:14.853 --> 00:15:17.447
...to rock till the morning light,
all right?


220
00:15:20.292 --> 00:15:23.659
Mr. Shad! Mr. Shad!
Wow, that was really great.


221
00:15:23.862 --> 00:15:25.989
Hey, I play a little guitar.
If you ever need-


222
00:15:26.198 --> 00:15:28.462
- Dewey!
- Yes, sir?


223
00:15:28.667 --> 00:15:30.567
I pay you to mop,
not bother the band.


224
00:15:30.769 --> 00:15:34.728
My customers come to dance erotically,
and they need a clean floor to do it on!


225
00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:36.931
Do your job or I'll find
somebody who will.


226
00:15:37.142 --> 00:15:38.734
Yes, sir.

227
00:15:46.085 --> 00:15:47.074
Lonesome blues

228
00:15:47.286 --> 00:15:50.414
Dewey, will you cut out that racket?
I'm trying to feed your child!


229
00:15:51.156 --> 00:15:54.353
How am I supposed to make it as
a famous musician if I don't practice?


230
00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:56.892
Will you stop talking
about that music?


231
00:15:57.096 --> 00:15:58.563
But it's my dream, baby.

232
00:15:58.764 --> 00:16:01.062
I am tired of hearing about
your dreams, Dewey Cox.


233
00:16:01.266 --> 00:16:03.393
You are a selfish dickhole.

234
00:16:03.802 --> 00:16:08.034
Daddy said if we move home, he could
give you a job at the slaughterhouse.


235
00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:09.764
You can make an honest living.

236
00:16:09.975 --> 00:16:14.036
Wouldn't have to hang your head in
shame, walking around like a failure.


237
00:16:14.246 --> 00:16:17.215
I think I'm doing okay for a 15-year-old
with a wife and a baby.


238
00:16:17.416 --> 00:16:18.974
But, sweetheart...

239
00:16:19.184 --> 00:16:23.052
...I thought you liked working
at the slaughterhouse for my daddy.


240
00:16:23.255 --> 00:16:24.654
I did.

241
00:16:26.859 --> 00:16:29.885
You got a real talent for this, boy.

242
00:16:30.095 --> 00:16:33.895
Someday this is all gonna be yours.

243
00:16:34.867 --> 00:16:39.429
It's just, as much as I loved it, Edith,
I want more than that.


244
00:16:39.638 --> 00:16:43.165
Ain't no musician ever made
no money, Dewey.


245
00:16:43.542 --> 00:16:46.102
What? Of course they do.
Plenty of them do.


246
00:16:46.311 --> 00:16:47.573
Name one.

247
00:16:49.715 --> 00:16:51.876
- Slim Whitman.
- Who the hell is Slim Whitman?


248
00:16:52.084 --> 00:16:53.551
All right, Frank Sinatra.

249
00:16:53.986 --> 00:16:56.147
Who the hell is Frank Sinatra?

250
00:16:56.355 --> 00:16:59.119
Edith, I am starting to think...

251
00:17:00.192 --> 00:17:02.126
...that maybe
you don't believe in me.


252
00:17:02.461 --> 00:17:04.326
I do believe in you.

253
00:17:04.530 --> 00:17:06.395
I just know you're gonna fail.

254
00:17:07.332 --> 00:17:10.324
- What are you talking about, Edith?
- What about my dreams?


255
00:17:10.536 --> 00:17:13.232
Edith, I told you,
I can't build you a candy house!


256
00:17:13.438 --> 00:17:16.737
It will fall down! The sun will
melt the candy! It won't work!


257
00:17:16.942 --> 00:17:18.341
It will if it never rains.

258
00:17:19.077 --> 00:17:22.410
Dewey, you have got
to give up your dream.


259
00:17:24.416 --> 00:17:27.749
Dreams don't come true.

260
00:17:32.391 --> 00:17:35.189
I am gonna make
this dream come true.


261
00:17:35.394 --> 00:17:37.658
Nobody ever said it's gonna be easy.

262
00:17:37.863 --> 00:17:38.921
It's hard.

263
00:17:39.364 --> 00:17:41.889
It ain't easy to walk
to the top of a mountain.


264
00:17:42.668 --> 00:17:45.398
It's a long, hard walk.

265
00:17:45.604 --> 00:17:47.572
It's a rocky road.

266
00:17:47.773 --> 00:17:49.570
But I plan on walking.

267
00:17:50.409 --> 00:17:52.309
Oh, I'm gonna walk.

268
00:17:52.978 --> 00:17:54.809
Hard.

269
00:17:56.048 --> 00:17:59.074
I will walk hard.

270
00:18:03.522 --> 00:18:07.049
Walk hard.

271
00:18:11.997 --> 00:18:13.897
I got a full house coming tonight.

272
00:18:14.099 --> 00:18:16.659
If Bobby Shad can't play
I need to find someone who can.


273
00:18:16.868 --> 00:18:19.098
I'm fine. I can play through the pain.

274
00:18:19.304 --> 00:18:22.603
Should've thought before you punched
your landlord and got laryngitis.


275
00:18:22.808 --> 00:18:24.435
I guess there's no music tonight.

276
00:18:24.643 --> 00:18:27.942
Bullhickey! People come here
to dance erotically!


277
00:18:28.146 --> 00:18:30.808
I ain't got no music,
I ain't got no nightclub.


278
00:18:32.217 --> 00:18:33.980
Excuse me.

279
00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:36.312
I play a little.

280
00:18:36.521 --> 00:18:39.012
I don't know how
to tell you this, boy.


281
00:18:39.224 --> 00:18:42.387
You're white.
This crowd will eat you alive.


282
00:18:42.594 --> 00:18:46.155
I been watching Mr. Shad every night.
I know all the songs.


283
00:18:46.365 --> 00:18:47.525
It'll be the same show.

284
00:18:47.733 --> 00:18:51.032
It'll be just like Bobby Shad and the
Bad Men, only it'll be me tonight.


285
00:18:52.938 --> 00:18:54.803
This is crazy.

286
00:18:56.208 --> 00:18:58.836
But I ain't got no other choice.

287
00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:03.639
I don't mean to put more
pressure on you, boy.


288
00:19:03.849 --> 00:19:07.250
The suits from the record company
just got here.


289
00:19:11.323 --> 00:19:13.382
Oh, okay.

290
00:19:14.426 --> 00:19:16.257
Scared?

291
00:19:16.762 --> 00:19:18.662
- A little.
- Well, you should be.


292
00:19:18.864 --> 00:19:21.128
Those Jews control show business.

293
00:19:21.333 --> 00:19:23.927
Just lay it down
exactly like Bobby does.


294
00:19:26.571 --> 00:19:30.530
Good evening. We're Bobby Shad
and the Bad Men. I'm Dewey Cox.


295
00:19:30.742 --> 00:19:34.371
Bobby Shad couldn't be here tonight
so I'm gonna do his show for you.


296
00:19:34.579 --> 00:19:36.444
And I hope you enjoy it.

297
00:19:39.051 --> 00:19:41.781
This first song
we're fitting to do is...


298
00:19:41.987 --> 00:19:43.716
Well, it's about...

299
00:19:45.057 --> 00:19:47.389
It's about when your woman
catches you.


300
00:19:47.592 --> 00:19:50.493
You know, she catches you
running around town...


301
00:19:50.696 --> 00:19:52.891
...getting into all kinds of strange.

302
00:19:53.098 --> 00:19:54.565
This is racially insensitive.

303
00:19:54.766 --> 00:19:59.863
And she says, "Son, get your lazy,
two-timing, Negro ass up out of here. "


304
00:20:00.572 --> 00:20:03.063
- And you say to her:
- What's he doing? You see that?


305
00:20:03.775 --> 00:20:05.936
You got to love your egro man

306
00:20:06.411 --> 00:20:08.709
You got to love your Negro man

307
00:20:09.214 --> 00:20:11.705
You got to love your Negro man

308
00:20:11.917 --> 00:20:14.112
You got to love your Negro man

309
00:20:14.619 --> 00:20:15.813
You got to love, love

310
00:20:16.021 --> 00:20:18.512
- Is he playing "Negro Man"?
- He is playing "Negro Man. "


311
00:20:18.724 --> 00:20:20.214
He's playing "Negro Man. "

312
00:20:20.425 --> 00:20:22.985
From early in the morning
Till late at night


313
00:20:23.195 --> 00:20:25.663
You know I love your apples
Let me take a bite


314
00:20:25.864 --> 00:20:28.094
You got to love your Negro man

315
00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:30.734
You got to love your Negro man

316
00:20:30.936 --> 00:20:33.234
You got to love, love, love, love, love

317
00:20:33.438 --> 00:20:35.167
Your Negro man

318
00:20:35.374 --> 00:20:36.739
Yeah, come on, Dewey.

319
00:20:36.942 --> 00:20:39.103
I know I treat you wrong
And that ain't right


320
00:20:39.311 --> 00:20:41.802
Let me put it on you, mama
And you'll feel all right


321
00:20:42.013 --> 00:20:44.413
You got to love your Negro man

322
00:20:44.616 --> 00:20:47.107
You got to love your Negro man

323
00:20:47.452 --> 00:20:49.716
You got to love, love, love, love, love

324
00:20:49.921 --> 00:20:51.912
Your Negro man

325
00:21:01.967 --> 00:21:05.425
Now, that's what I call
winning over an audience.


326
00:21:06.571 --> 00:21:08.732
Go, Dewey, go.

327
00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:18.839
I like what you did out there tonight.
Have you ever made a recording?


328
00:21:19.317 --> 00:21:22.445
Oh, Mr. L'Chaim, Mr. Mazeltov,
that's been my dream.


329
00:21:22.654 --> 00:21:25.418
He's not the one you want.
I'm the one you want.


330
00:21:25.624 --> 00:21:28.354
- I think he's the one we want.
- He's got a nice thing.


331
00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:32.121
He's not bad with the singing and the
playing and the shaking of the tochis.


332
00:21:32.464 --> 00:21:36.332
I think you've got what it takes
to make it in the big time.


333
00:21:37.302 --> 00:21:38.360
The big time?

334
00:21:40.105 --> 00:21:44.235
When the moon hits your eye
Like a big pizza pie


335
00:21:44.443 --> 00:21:46.035
That's amore

336
00:21:46.244 --> 00:21:48.212
When the world seems to shine

337
00:21:48.413 --> 00:21:49.437
What the hell is this?

338
00:21:49.648 --> 00:21:52.344
Pizza pie. What's in a pizza pie?

339
00:21:53.018 --> 00:21:56.146
Bells will ring
Ting-a-ling-a-ling, ting-a-ling-a-ling


340
00:21:56.354 --> 00:21:59.152
And you'll sing "Vita bella"

341
00:21:59.357 --> 00:22:01.552
Hearts will play
Tippy-tippy-tay


342
00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:03.728
Please, I can't anymore.

343
00:22:06.731 --> 00:22:07.925
That's what I was gonna say.

344
00:22:08.133 --> 00:22:13.935
- That's amore
- Amore


345
00:22:19.878 --> 00:22:21.846
That is amore

346
00:22:22.047 --> 00:22:25.141
All right. Hold, please. Stop that.
Stop your singing!


347
00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:27.409
Stop your singing this instant,
young man!


348
00:22:27.619 --> 00:22:29.883
I will not have this in my studio!

349
00:22:30.155 --> 00:22:32.453
That's just a terrible, terrible...

350
00:22:32.657 --> 00:22:36.787
...terrible, terrible "That's Amore. "

351
00:22:37.162 --> 00:22:39.392
Maybe it was a wrong song choice?

352
00:22:39.598 --> 00:22:43.728
If you just let me play one of my songs,
I think you'll like it a whole lot better.


353
00:22:43.935 --> 00:22:47.462
You have failed conclusively.
It's over.


354
00:22:47.672 --> 00:22:49.640
And there is nothing
that you can do...


355
00:22:49.841 --> 00:22:52.571
...here in this room
that can turn that around.


356
00:22:52.777 --> 00:22:56.543
Nothing you can do that can make up
for what you did to "That's Amore. "


357
00:22:56.882 --> 00:22:59.817
- Well, my mother liked it a whole lot.
- Your mother was wrong.


358
00:23:00.952 --> 00:23:02.681
I was willing to open my mind...

359
00:23:02.888 --> 00:23:05.789
...because these Jewish gentlemen
brought you in here.


360
00:23:05.991 --> 00:23:07.788
They usually have good taste.

361
00:23:08.093 --> 00:23:11.529
And now here you are in front of me
pretending you can sing.


362
00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:13.857
And I have to say that today...

363
00:23:14.065 --> 00:23:17.432
...your performance has shaken
my belief in the Jewish people.


364
00:23:17.636 --> 00:23:19.831
Well, there's nothing
I would like more, sir...


365
00:23:20.038 --> 00:23:23.735
...than to restore your faith in Judaism,
if you could just give me that shot.


366
00:23:23.942 --> 00:23:26.069
But I'll tell you,
you have failed so far...


367
00:23:26.278 --> 00:23:30.044
...and if somehow you are able
to sing a song now...


368
00:23:30.248 --> 00:23:32.773
...bringing these boys together
you haven't even met...


369
00:23:33.418 --> 00:23:35.545
...and make something
so personal, so new...


370
00:23:36.021 --> 00:23:37.989
...that the whole world takes notice...

371
00:23:38.189 --> 00:23:41.090
...and that your life
is never the same again...


372
00:23:41.459 --> 00:23:45.759
But I'm telling you right now,
I don't think it's going to happen.


373
00:23:46.398 --> 00:23:50.129
Wait, wait, wait. We're here already.
What could it possibly hurt?


374
00:23:51.069 --> 00:23:53.629
L'Chaim, I'll do it for you.
But just one more song.


375
00:23:53.838 --> 00:23:55.396
All right.

376
00:23:57.509 --> 00:24:00.808
All right, son. I'm gonna
give you 15 more seconds.


377
00:24:02.714 --> 00:24:04.841
Thank you, sir.
I hope you won't regret it.


378
00:24:07.118 --> 00:24:09.313
Dewey, we don't know this song.

379
00:24:10.589 --> 00:24:11.681
You just follow me.

380
00:24:12.891 --> 00:24:13.983
I don't know.

381
00:24:31.543 --> 00:24:32.908
Walk hard

382
00:24:34.613 --> 00:24:35.705
Hard

383
00:24:35.914 --> 00:24:37.108
Walk hard?

384
00:24:37.315 --> 00:24:40.409
Down life's rocky road

385
00:24:42.487 --> 00:24:44.148
Walk bold

386
00:24:45.523 --> 00:24:46.820
Hard

387
00:24:47.626 --> 00:24:50.060
That's my creed

388
00:24:50.729 --> 00:24:52.788
My code

389
00:24:52.998 --> 00:24:56.365
I been scorned and slandered
And ridiculed too


390
00:24:57.836 --> 00:25:01.169
Had to struggle every day
My whole life through


391
00:25:02.307 --> 00:25:05.743
Seen my share of the worst
That the world can give


392
00:25:06.811 --> 00:25:11.407
But I still got a dream
And a burnin' rage to live


393
00:25:11.816 --> 00:25:13.511
Walk hard

394
00:25:14.619 --> 00:25:15.916
Hard

395
00:25:17.255 --> 00:25:19.917
Here is America's new hit song
"Walk Hard"...


396
00:25:20.125 --> 00:25:23.424
...recorded just 35 minutes ago
by Dewey Cox.


397
00:25:24.529 --> 00:25:26.258
Hard

398
00:25:26.598 --> 00:25:28.589
Though they say

399
00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:31.530
You're not the one

400
00:25:31.736 --> 00:25:35.069
Even if you've been told
Time and time again


401
00:25:36.074 --> 00:25:39.635
That you're always gonna lose
And never gonna win


402
00:25:40.712 --> 00:25:43.476
You gotta keep that vision
In your mind's eye


403
00:25:45.016 --> 00:25:49.476
When you're standin' on top
Of a mountain high


404
00:25:57.862 --> 00:25:59.853
He walks so hard.

405
00:26:00.065 --> 00:26:01.498
How do I walk, boys?

406
00:26:02.567 --> 00:26:04.000
Hard

407
00:26:07.238 --> 00:26:10.139
When I meet my maker
On my dying day


408
00:26:11.443 --> 00:26:14.241
I'm gonna look him in the eye
And by God, I'll say


409
00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:19.145
I gave my word
And my word was good


410
00:26:20.051 --> 00:26:23.350
I took it in the face
And I walked as hard as I could


411
00:26:23.555 --> 00:26:26.490
Oh, hey, Shorty. 
Hello, my darling.

412
00:26:26.691 --> 00:26:29.319
I sang a song at a circus
in New Jersey.


413
00:26:29.527 --> 00:26:31.324
They said, "We'll give you 5 grand. "

414
00:26:31.529 --> 00:26:34.191
I said, "No, you won't.
You'll give me that giraffe. "


415
00:26:34.432 --> 00:26:38.129
- And they did. They gave it right to me.
- That is one beautiful giraffe.


416
00:26:38.336 --> 00:26:39.325
Thank you.

417
00:26:40.071 --> 00:26:41.766
It'll just be a few weeks, Edith.

418
00:26:41.973 --> 00:26:44.066
Who's gonna help me
take care of the children?


419
00:26:44.275 --> 00:26:46.766
Dewey, you have got to
give up this dream.


420
00:26:46.978 --> 00:26:50.072
You're never gonna make it.
Give it up, Dewey.


421
00:26:50.381 --> 00:26:54.249
What are you talking about?
I got a number one hit on the radio.


422
00:26:54.452 --> 00:26:56.682
I'm playing my music
for people who wanna hear me.


423
00:26:56.888 --> 00:26:58.685
It's everything we always wanted,
Edith.


424
00:26:58.890 --> 00:27:02.121
I never get to see you anymore.
Your kids never get to see you.


425
00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:04.519
I don't know how to tell you this.

426
00:27:04.763 --> 00:27:06.253
I'm gonna miss some things, okay?

427
00:27:06.464 --> 00:27:08.932
I'm gonna miss some birthdays
and some christenings.


428
00:27:09.134 --> 00:27:10.829
I'm gonna miss some births, period.

429
00:27:11.035 --> 00:27:14.163
Unrealistic to think I'm gonna be
here every time you have a baby.


430
00:27:14.439 --> 00:27:17.806
But aren't you happy?
You have a beautiful new home.


431
00:27:18.009 --> 00:27:20.739
All your fancy new clothes
and your monkey and your giraffe.


432
00:27:21.179 --> 00:27:23.113
Look, what else you need?

433
00:27:23.314 --> 00:27:27.114
How about I get you
a crow that could talk?


434
00:27:27.418 --> 00:27:30.751
And I'll teach him phrases that I say.
"Good morning, honey. "


435
00:27:30.955 --> 00:27:34.652
- But it'll be a little crow talking.
- This ain't about no exotic pets!


436
00:27:34.859 --> 00:27:37.919
It's about love,
you stupid piece of shit.


437
00:27:38.129 --> 00:27:40.256
- Dewey.
- Edith!


438
00:27:40.465 --> 00:27:42.933
Don't you go in the bathroom.

439
00:27:43.134 --> 00:27:45.102
Edith, please.

440
00:27:45.303 --> 00:27:48.466
Mama said there's a lot of evil
on the road.


441
00:27:48.673 --> 00:27:50.504
Temptations.

442
00:27:50.708 --> 00:27:53.233
They'll make a man do evil things.

443
00:27:53.444 --> 00:27:58.609
Edith, that is ridiculous.
Is that what this is all about?


444
00:27:58.817 --> 00:28:01.047
There ain't no evil out there.

445
00:28:01.586 --> 00:28:03.884
Come on, now, cupcake,
open the door.


446
00:28:06.558 --> 00:28:08.355
Edith.

447
00:28:10.028 --> 00:28:15.364
My beautiful, beautiful,
beautiful angel.


448
00:28:18.903 --> 00:28:21.428
You know how much I love you.

449
00:28:22.106 --> 00:28:24.074
You and this fast-growing family
of ours...


450
00:28:24.275 --> 00:28:26.243
...is the only thing
that matters to me.


451
00:28:26.444 --> 00:28:27.968
You understand that?

452
00:28:28.179 --> 00:28:32.980
Heck, life without you
would be like no life at all.


453
00:28:35.153 --> 00:28:38.520
Like no life at all.

454
00:28:39.257 --> 00:28:41.487
Where's a pencil? 
Where's a pencil?

455
00:28:41.693 --> 00:28:44.560
Dewey!

456
00:28:46.164 --> 00:28:47.256
Hello, baby!

457
00:28:47.932 --> 00:28:50.594
Yeah, this is
the Big Bopper speaking.


458
00:28:52.337 --> 00:28:54.430
Oh, you sweet thing.

459
00:28:54.639 --> 00:28:56.231
Do I what?

460
00:28:56.608 --> 00:28:58.599
Will I what?

461
00:28:58.810 --> 00:29:03.440
Oh, baby, you know what I like.

462
00:29:04.048 --> 00:29:08.314
Chantilly lace and a pretty face
And a ponytail


463
00:29:08.519 --> 00:29:10.419
How are we supposed to follow that?

464
00:29:10.622 --> 00:29:12.419
Don't worry, Dewey, you'll do great.

465
00:29:12.624 --> 00:29:15.422
- Thanks, Buddy Holly.
- If you don't, I'll pick it back up.


466
00:29:15.627 --> 00:29:17.788
- You got nothing to worry about.
- Oh, thank you.


467
00:29:18.229 --> 00:29:20.197
I really like that "Walk Hard" song.

468
00:29:20.798 --> 00:29:22.231
Oh, thanks.

469
00:29:22.433 --> 00:29:25.630
I like that "Peggy Sue" song.
It's my favorite Buddy Holly song.


470
00:29:25.837 --> 00:29:28.271
Thanks, Dewey.
I'm awful proud of that one.


471
00:29:28.473 --> 00:29:30.498
Man, I'm awful nervous, Buddy Holly.

472
00:29:30.708 --> 00:29:33.973
Dewey, you'll be fine,
or my name's not Buddy Holly.


473
00:29:34.178 --> 00:29:37.477
Change of plans. Elvis wants
to get out of here early. He's hungry.


474
00:29:37.682 --> 00:29:40.651
We'll change the order.
After the Big Bopper, it's Buddy Holly...


475
00:29:40.852 --> 00:29:43.946
...then Elvis Presley,
and then you, Dewey Cox.


476
00:29:44.155 --> 00:29:47.249
So it's the Big Bopper...

477
00:29:47.458 --> 00:29:48.982
...and then Buddy Holly...

478
00:29:49.193 --> 00:29:52.629
...and then Elvis Presley,
and then me?


479
00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:55.162
Yeah. Just for tonight.

480
00:29:55.366 --> 00:29:58.824
Well, I'm just happy to be here.

481
00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:04.170
What am I doing?

482
00:30:04.375 --> 00:30:06.570
I ain't good enough to follow Elvis.

483
00:30:06.778 --> 00:30:09.246
What are you talking about, Dewey?

484
00:30:13.351 --> 00:30:15.979
Nate. Nate, is that you?

485
00:30:16.187 --> 00:30:19.122
You can do it, Dewey.
I know you can.


486
00:30:19.324 --> 00:30:22.816
I know because I'm your brother,
and I believe in you.


487
00:30:23.027 --> 00:30:25.325
But, hell, ain't nobody
can follow Elvis.


488
00:30:25.763 --> 00:30:28.755
- Wait, did you say Elvis?
- Yeah.


489
00:30:28.967 --> 00:30:31.765
Elvis Presley?
The King of Rock 'n' Roll?


490
00:30:31.970 --> 00:30:33.335
Yeah, Elvis Presley.

491
00:30:33.538 --> 00:30:35.563
He has nine number one hits.

492
00:30:35.773 --> 00:30:37.172
Nate, I understand that.

493
00:30:37.375 --> 00:30:39.206
He has 50 million fans.

494
00:30:39.410 --> 00:30:41.844
I'm aware of that, Nate.
That's why I'm out here.


495
00:30:42.046 --> 00:30:43.343
I'm having a crisis.

496
00:30:43.614 --> 00:30:45.206
Holy shit.

497
00:30:46.818 --> 00:30:49.912
Dewey! The big fella's on his
final encore. Are you ready?


498
00:30:51.389 --> 00:30:54.722
Yeah. I'm ready.

499
00:31:01.866 --> 00:31:03.800
Elvis!

500
00:31:05.770 --> 00:31:06.828
Ladies.

501
00:31:07.038 --> 00:31:09.905
Dang, Elvis Presley, you didn't
have to rile them up like that.


502
00:31:10.108 --> 00:31:11.735
What, now?

503
00:31:11.976 --> 00:31:13.807
- No, I'm-
- Excuse me, what?


504
00:31:14.012 --> 00:31:16.139
I'm just saying,
we gotta follow that and-


505
00:31:16.347 --> 00:31:19.145
Well, sometimes you have to go all out
when you're the King.


506
00:31:19.350 --> 00:31:21.580
Because there's only one man
who's the King.


507
00:31:21.786 --> 00:31:23.651
God picks him, hand-plucks him.

508
00:31:23.855 --> 00:31:27.552
One night, God looked down at all the
millions and millions of people, man...


509
00:31:27.759 --> 00:31:31.160
...and he decided which one
was the best, and it was me.


510
00:31:31.362 --> 00:31:35.128
He plucked me from all those millions
and millions of people, man.


511
00:31:35.466 --> 00:31:37.559
- Yeah.
- Listen to this, right now.


512
00:31:37.769 --> 00:31:41.261
There's two things you need to know.
I'm the King. And number two is:


513
00:31:41.472 --> 00:31:43.997
Look out, man! Look at that
coming at you. You see that?


514
00:31:44.208 --> 00:31:46.768
It's called karate
and only two kinds of people know it.


515
00:31:46.978 --> 00:31:49.105
The Chinese and the King.

516
00:31:49.313 --> 00:31:50.746
And one of them is me.

517
00:31:50.948 --> 00:31:51.972
You're the King.

518
00:31:52.183 --> 00:31:55.812
On to Memphis, they want a nice little
honey and a little bit of June bug.


519
00:31:56.020 --> 00:31:57.647
- Yeah?
- Yeah...


520
00:31:59.757 --> 00:32:01.281
Come on, man...

521
00:32:03.294 --> 00:32:04.784
Look out, man!

522
00:32:06.197 --> 00:32:07.391
Well, thanks, Elvis.

523
00:32:10.268 --> 00:32:12.702
Let's go. Come on, mama.

524
00:32:13.404 --> 00:32:15.998
What the fuck was he talking about?

525
00:32:18.543 --> 00:32:21.706
How y'all doing?
My name's Dewey Cox.


526
00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:27.713
And, well, looks like I got some
proving myself to do.


527
00:32:28.953 --> 00:32:30.318
Sam.

528
00:32:41.332 --> 00:32:42.663
Walk hard

529
00:32:44.035 --> 00:32:45.263
Hard

530
00:32:46.504 --> 00:32:49.905
Down life's rocky road

531
00:32:57.115 --> 00:32:59.015
Wow, great playing, boys.

532
00:32:59.217 --> 00:33:00.741
The fillies love you, Dewey.

533
00:33:00.952 --> 00:33:04.285
If I wasn't married with a good head on
my shoulders, I don't know what I'd do.


534
00:33:04.489 --> 00:33:07.049
You gotta get back out there.
They are going crazy.


535
00:33:07.258 --> 00:33:08.919
Let me splash some water
on my face.


536
00:33:09.127 --> 00:33:10.719
Okay. Hurry up!

537
00:33:12.497 --> 00:33:15.261
Golly, that rock 'n' roll.

538
00:33:19.270 --> 00:33:21.966
- Get out of here, Dewey.
- What are y'all doing in here?


539
00:33:22.173 --> 00:33:25.904
We're smoking reefer,
and you don't want no part of this shit.


540
00:33:26.110 --> 00:33:27.475
You're smoking reefers?

541
00:33:27.678 --> 00:33:29.441
Of course we are.
Can't you smell it?


542
00:33:29.981 --> 00:33:32.609
No, Sam, I can't.

543
00:33:32.817 --> 00:33:34.682
Come on, Dewey, join the party.

544
00:33:34.886 --> 00:33:38.617
No, Dewey, you don't want this.
Get out of here!


545
00:33:38.823 --> 00:33:41.485
I don't want no hangover.
I can't get no hangover.


546
00:33:41.692 --> 00:33:43.785
It doesn't give you a hangover.

547
00:33:43.995 --> 00:33:46.896
Will I get addicted to it
or something?


548
00:33:47.098 --> 00:33:48.793
It's not habit-forming.

549
00:33:49.333 --> 00:33:51.301
Oh, okay, well...

550
00:33:51.802 --> 00:33:55.260
I don't know.
I don't wanna overdose on it.


551
00:33:55.473 --> 00:33:56.667
You can't OD on it.

552
00:33:57.708 --> 00:33:59.642
It's not gonna make me
wanna have sex, is it?


553
00:33:59.844 --> 00:34:01.471
It makes sex even better.

554
00:34:02.246 --> 00:34:03.713
Sounds kind of expensive.

555
00:34:03.915 --> 00:34:05.974
It's the cheapest drug there is.

556
00:34:08.419 --> 00:34:09.545
You don't want it.

557
00:34:10.521 --> 00:34:12.011
I think I kind of want it.

558
00:34:12.757 --> 00:34:15.282
Okay, but just this once.
Come on in.


559
00:34:18.396 --> 00:34:20.956
- What do I do?
- Like this.


560
00:34:37.281 --> 00:34:38.805
Oh, my.

561
00:34:39.016 --> 00:34:43.180
Hey, listen, folks. I'd like to play
a song I wrote for a very special lady.


562
00:34:43.387 --> 00:34:45.446
I'm talking about Mrs. Dewey Cox.

563
00:34:47.892 --> 00:34:50.019
Oh, my darlin'

564
00:34:50.228 --> 00:34:52.196
Oh, my darlin'

565
00:34:52.396 --> 00:34:55.854
Yeah, yeah, yeah

566
00:34:56.100 --> 00:35:00.560
I have a perfect life

567
00:35:00.771 --> 00:35:04.935
You are the perfect wife

568
00:35:05.142 --> 00:35:09.101
I don't know why

569
00:35:09.313 --> 00:35:13.716
I sit and cry

570
00:35:14.185 --> 00:35:18.815
And now I miss you so

571
00:35:19.023 --> 00:35:23.221
Please don't let me go

572
00:35:23.427 --> 00:35:27.056
I make mistakes and that is true

573
00:35:27.665 --> 00:35:31.931
At least I learn each time I do

574
00:35:32.136 --> 00:35:33.125
Here, have some of this.

575
00:35:33.337 --> 00:35:35.669
Darling, you must believe

576
00:35:35.873 --> 00:35:41.607
I could never leave you
If I tried


577
00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:45.909
A life without you

578
00:35:46.117 --> 00:35:53.853
Is no life at all

579
00:35:56.427 --> 00:35:58.054
Oh, my darlin'

580
00:35:58.262 --> 00:36:00.093
Oh, my darlin'

581
00:36:00.298 --> 00:36:02.698
Yeah, yeah, yeah

582
00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:04.765
Beth Anne.

583
00:36:04.969 --> 00:36:06.436
Can I get that for you?

584
00:36:06.637 --> 00:36:08.104
Thanks, Dewey.

585
00:36:08.839 --> 00:36:12.900
Tears fall in vain

586
00:36:13.110 --> 00:36:17.376
I'm standing in the rain

587
00:36:17.581 --> 00:36:21.677
No matter how I feel

588
00:36:21.886 --> 00:36:26.721
I never seem to know what's real

589
00:36:26.924 --> 00:36:30.257
So sharpen up your knives

590
00:36:30.461 --> 00:36:33.453
- Can I get that for you?
- Thanks, Dewey.


591
00:36:35.499 --> 00:36:38.297
I'm a bad horse.

592
00:36:40.104 --> 00:36:43.096
Phil, can I get that for you?

593
00:36:44.508 --> 00:36:45.873
Thanks, Dewey.

594
00:36:46.077 --> 00:36:48.102
Darling, you must believe

595
00:36:48.312 --> 00:36:50.507
I could never leave you
If I tried


596
00:36:50.715 --> 00:36:54.048
Phil? What happened?

597
00:36:55.152 --> 00:36:58.212
A life without you

598
00:36:58.422 --> 00:37:06.727
Is no life at all

599
00:37:11.902 --> 00:37:13.870
Well, the tour's going
real great, baby.


600
00:37:14.071 --> 00:37:16.130
Yeah, we're having a real nice time.

601
00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:18.399
Yeah, the boys have been
playing great...


602
00:37:18.609 --> 00:37:21.169
...and the audiences have been
just wonderful, so...


603
00:37:21.379 --> 00:37:23.677
- When you coming home?
- Soon, baby, real soon.


604
00:37:23.881 --> 00:37:27.112
We gotta hit the major markets in
the Northeast, Chicago, Detroit-


605
00:37:27.318 --> 00:37:31.015
Dewey, could you shut up? I'm trying to
have sex with these women down here.


606
00:37:31.222 --> 00:37:32.746
Who's that?

607
00:37:33.090 --> 00:37:35.888
Oh, that's Sam.

608
00:37:36.093 --> 00:37:39.290
- He's just looking for his drumsticks.
- Howdy.


609
00:37:39.497 --> 00:37:41.089
Excuse me.

610
00:37:42.967 --> 00:37:47.233
Anyway, you don't wanna hear about
this boring stuff. How was your day?


611
00:37:47.438 --> 00:37:50.134
Oh, you know,
just taking care of the kids.


612
00:37:50.341 --> 00:37:53.708
Went down to Wilson's Market
the other day to pick up some milk.


613
00:37:53.911 --> 00:37:56.778
Completely out of milk.
I had to go down to Peach Street.


614
00:37:56.981 --> 00:37:59.677
- I hate going down there.
- Oh, brother. Can you believe it?


615
00:37:59.884 --> 00:38:00.908
- Yes, Bert?
- Hey, Dewey.


616
00:38:01.118 --> 00:38:03.348
- You want a cup of coffee?
- No, thank you.


617
00:38:03.554 --> 00:38:05.886
Will you give me a minute?
I'm on the phone here.


618
00:38:06.390 --> 00:38:08.017
- Who's that?
- That's Bert, my roadie.


619
00:38:08.225 --> 00:38:11.319
Just wants to know if I want any coffee
or anything like that.


620
00:38:12.563 --> 00:38:16.761
Dewey, there's a distance growing
between us, I feel, and I don't like it.


621
00:38:16.967 --> 00:38:19.060
Oh, now, that is crazy talk, Edith.

622
00:38:19.270 --> 00:38:20.794
You know
I'm just the same old Dewey.


623
00:38:21.005 --> 00:38:22.734
- Hey, Dewey.
- Yes, Bert?


624
00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:24.168
You seen my sandals?

625
00:38:24.775 --> 00:38:28.040
I don't know.
I'm talking to my wife, Bert.


626
00:38:29.180 --> 00:38:31.375
Baby, there's somebody at the door.
I gotta go.


627
00:38:31.582 --> 00:38:33.209
Can I call when
I get to New Jersey?

628
00:38:33.417 --> 00:38:34.748
Okay. Bye, Dewey.

629
00:38:34.952 --> 00:38:36.283
- I love you.
- All right.


630
00:38:36.487 --> 00:38:37.681
- I love you.
- I love you.


631
00:38:37.888 --> 00:38:40.288
- You're never gonna make it, okay?
- Okay, bye.


632
00:38:40.825 --> 00:38:41.951
Bye.

633
00:38:46.163 --> 00:38:48.256
- Pa.
- Dewey.


634
00:38:48.466 --> 00:38:50.093
What are you doing here?

635
00:38:50.367 --> 00:38:51.595
It's about your mama.

636
00:38:52.937 --> 00:38:55.735
Ma? What about her? Is she okay?

637
00:38:58.442 --> 00:39:01.104
We better step out into the hall.

638
00:39:04.048 --> 00:39:07.347
- What happened?
- I'll tell you what happened.


639
00:39:07.585 --> 00:39:12.454
We were readying for bed
when your song comes on the radio.


640
00:39:12.656 --> 00:39:14.624
It's Dewey!

641
00:39:15.125 --> 00:39:18.117
Your son is talented.
You should be proud.


642
00:39:18.963 --> 00:39:23.366
Well, I must admit,
it is kind of catchy.


643
00:39:23.567 --> 00:39:24.898
Dance with me, Pa.

644
00:39:27.471 --> 00:39:29.962
It does make you kind of wanna move,
doesn't it?


645
00:39:30.174 --> 00:39:31.539
It sure does.

646
00:39:33.577 --> 00:39:36.478
Maybe I have been
kind of hard on little Dewey.


647
00:39:36.914 --> 00:39:38.541
Maybe you have.

648
00:39:43.587 --> 00:39:45.145
Be careful, Ma.

649
00:39:46.457 --> 00:39:48.891
- You all right, Ma?
- I'm all right.


650
00:39:53.664 --> 00:39:57.430
The vertigo, it won in the end.

651
00:39:57.668 --> 00:39:59.863
She lost her balance...

652
00:40:00.237 --> 00:40:02.432
...and fell out the window...

653
00:40:03.641 --> 00:40:05.541
...and then the radio
crushed her head?


654
00:40:05.743 --> 00:40:08.268
While she was dancing to your song.

655
00:40:08.913 --> 00:40:11.279
I thought you should know
what your music does.


656
00:40:11.482 --> 00:40:13.245
It kills people.

657
00:40:13.450 --> 00:40:16.647
You made her happy
and it killed her.


658
00:40:16.854 --> 00:40:21.018
If Nate was alive,
this never would have happened.


659
00:40:26.330 --> 00:40:28.491
Wrong kid died.

660
00:40:31.669 --> 00:40:34.399
Damn you, God!

661
00:40:36.740 --> 00:40:40.403
How could you let my mama
fall out a window?


662
00:40:41.412 --> 00:40:45.041
And then let a radio
hit her on the head?


663
00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:51.880
- Get out of here, Dewey.
- What are y'all doing in here?


664
00:40:52.256 --> 00:40:56.022
It's called cocaine,
and you don't want no part of this shit.


665
00:40:56.226 --> 00:40:58.057
Cocaine?

666
00:40:59.063 --> 00:41:00.030
What's it do?

667
00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:02.892
It turns all your bad feelings
into good feelings.


668
00:41:03.734 --> 00:41:05.292
It's a nightmare.

669
00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:09.701
I'm thinking maybe I'd like to try me
some of that cocaine.


670
00:41:11.642 --> 00:41:14.736
When I meet my maker
On my dying day


671
00:41:14.945 --> 00:41:17.607
Look him in the eye
And by God I'll say


672
00:41:18.282 --> 00:41:20.648
I gave my word
And my word was good


673
00:41:21.852 --> 00:41:25.845
I took it in the face
And I walked as hard as I could


674
00:41:26.056 --> 00:41:29.150
Walk hard
Walk hard, hard, hard


675
00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:31.157
Walk hard, hard, hard
Walk...


676
00:41:36.967 --> 00:41:39.299
All right, again. Faster.

677
00:41:39.503 --> 00:41:44.133
This is crazy, Dewey. Ain't nobody
gonna wanna listen to music like this.


678
00:41:44.341 --> 00:41:46.502
Standing there
playing as fast as you can...


679
00:41:46.710 --> 00:41:49.338
...singing like some sort of punk.

680
00:41:49.947 --> 00:41:52.780
Don't you dare try to stifle me.

681
00:41:52.983 --> 00:41:56.419
Whose band is this anyway,
you cocksucker!


682
00:41:56.854 --> 00:41:59.049
I'll punch you in the mouth!

683
00:42:00.457 --> 00:42:03.051
Oh, God. I'm sorry, Dave.

684
00:42:03.827 --> 00:42:05.818
No, I didn't mean that.

685
00:42:06.530 --> 00:42:11.331
Just with my mama dying and all,
I'm just all twisted up inside.


686
00:42:11.535 --> 00:42:12.763
Mr. Cox?

687
00:42:13.971 --> 00:42:18.465
I heard you were looking for a new
backup singer. For your new duet.


688
00:42:22.212 --> 00:42:23.201
You heard right.

689
00:42:23.614 --> 00:42:26.674
I was wondering if you might like
to give me a try.


690
00:42:27.084 --> 00:42:29.075
I reckon I might.

691
00:42:32.623 --> 00:42:35.353
I've been singing in my church choir
since I was a girl.


692
00:42:35.859 --> 00:42:37.019
I like the sound of that.

693
00:42:38.996 --> 00:42:40.691
Darlene Madison.

694
00:42:41.732 --> 00:42:43.529
Dewey Cox.

695
00:42:44.368 --> 00:42:46.598
Hello, Darlene.

696
00:42:48.906 --> 00:42:51.101
Hello, Mr. Cox.

697
00:42:52.176 --> 00:42:54.235
You ready to sing one?

698
00:42:54.445 --> 00:42:56.504
I'm always ready.

699
00:42:57.481 --> 00:42:59.210
Well, all right.

700
00:43:01.251 --> 00:43:04.220
In my dreams you're blowin' me

701
00:43:04.421 --> 00:43:05.911
Some kisses

702
00:43:08.392 --> 00:43:12.886
That's one of my favorite things
To do


703
00:43:14.732 --> 00:43:17.530
You and I could go down

704
00:43:17.735 --> 00:43:19.202
In history

705
00:43:21.739 --> 00:43:26.438
That's what I'm prayin' to do with you

706
00:43:26.977 --> 00:43:28.672
Let's duet

707
00:43:29.546 --> 00:43:33.209
In ways that make us feel good

708
00:43:33.784 --> 00:43:35.411
Let's duet

709
00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:39.746
And make that sacred sound

710
00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:45.628
Dewey Cox!
I am not that kind of woman.


711
00:43:47.698 --> 00:43:49.996
- All right.
- Well...


712
00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:52.862
...that doesn't mean
that we still can't be friends.


713
00:43:53.737 --> 00:43:55.329
Okay.

714
00:43:55.539 --> 00:43:58.064
Well, then, here's to us
being great friends.


715
00:44:02.646 --> 00:44:04.705
I can't! We're friends!

716
00:44:06.049 --> 00:44:08.176
I'm gonna beat off

717
00:44:08.418 --> 00:44:10.249
All my demons

718
00:44:12.356 --> 00:44:17.419
That's what lovin' 
Jesus' all about

719
00:44:19.029 --> 00:44:23.659
Lookin' in your eyes I start believin'

720
00:44:26.036 --> 00:44:30.905
Let's bring this whisper to a shout

721
00:44:31.375 --> 00:44:33.138
Let's duet

722
00:44:33.844 --> 00:44:37.644
In ways that make us feel good

723
00:44:38.515 --> 00:44:41.313
Put two and two together

724
00:44:41.518 --> 00:44:44.851
Perfect harmony we've found

725
00:44:45.088 --> 00:44:48.080
We know it's only natural

726
00:44:48.292 --> 00:44:50.817
Let's duet

727
00:44:52.162 --> 00:44:54.596
I just wanna make out

728
00:44:54.798 --> 00:44:56.493
What you're sayin'

729
00:44:58.702 --> 00:45:03.298
Read my lips
It's what you're lookin' for


730
00:45:05.509 --> 00:45:09.843
Here I am a-sneakin' up behind you

731
00:45:12.015 --> 00:45:17.612
You can always come in
My back door


732
00:45:17.821 --> 00:45:19.379
Let's duet

733
00:45:27.231 --> 00:45:31.759
Darlene, these last three weeks
have been so...


734
00:45:31.969 --> 00:45:34.199
...full and wonderful.

735
00:45:34.404 --> 00:45:37.601
We've shared so many activities
together as good friends.


736
00:45:37.808 --> 00:45:42.336
It's like you understand me
the way nobody else ever has.


737
00:45:42.779 --> 00:45:44.474
I mean, if I-

738
00:45:51.355 --> 00:45:54.791
- What is it, Dewey?
- I don't know.


739
00:45:55.459 --> 00:45:56.926
It's nothing. I'm fine.

740
00:45:57.127 --> 00:46:00.119
Nothing? You look like
you seen a ghost.


741
00:46:01.598 --> 00:46:04.431
I got a lot
of pain in me, Darlene.

742
00:46:05.302 --> 00:46:06.564
You should know that.

743
00:46:06.937 --> 00:46:09.098
Where does all that pain
come from, Dewey?


744
00:46:10.574 --> 00:46:14.476
Did you ever have something
that you really loved...


745
00:46:15.545 --> 00:46:18.343
...that you accidentally...

746
00:46:19.983 --> 00:46:23.441
...killed, or hurt in some way,
with a machete?


747
00:46:23.654 --> 00:46:25.781
- No.
- No, me neither.


748
00:46:25.989 --> 00:46:28.423
- Wouldn't that be terrible?
- How would you live?


749
00:46:28.625 --> 00:46:31.560
I know, right? Exactly.

750
00:46:31.995 --> 00:46:34.190
Darling Darlene

751
00:46:35.599 --> 00:46:38.932
Darling Darlene

752
00:46:39.136 --> 00:46:42.230
I'm in love with you
I'm havin' fun with you


753
00:46:42.439 --> 00:46:45.533
I'm in love with you
I'm on the run with you


754
00:46:45.742 --> 00:46:50.873
I'm in love with you
And I'll be one with you one day


755
00:46:56.853 --> 00:46:59.117
Thanks for letting me sleep
in your bunk, Dewey.


756
00:46:59.323 --> 00:47:01.086
Gotta sleep somewhere, right?

757
00:47:04.194 --> 00:47:06.594
- Dewey, I can't.
- I know. I know.


758
00:47:07.230 --> 00:47:10.859
We both know that the sexual tension
between us is palpable.


759
00:47:11.234 --> 00:47:14.670
Don't you know that I wrestle with
the same temptations you do?


760
00:47:14.871 --> 00:47:17.305
I know I shouldn't be saying this
to you, Dewey...


761
00:47:17.507 --> 00:47:20.305
...because we're not married
and we're just friends...


762
00:47:20.510 --> 00:47:25.777
...but sometimes I lie awake at night
aching for a man's touch.


763
00:47:26.683 --> 00:47:29.948
And by "a man's touch,"
I mean a penis in my vagina.


764
00:47:31.188 --> 00:47:32.917
It's just so silly.

765
00:47:33.123 --> 00:47:35.182
Oh, that's so silly.

766
00:47:35.392 --> 00:47:38.361
- Well, we better get some sleep.
- Okay.


767
00:47:40.530 --> 00:47:42.657
Take my hand, Dewey.

768
00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:47.296
Let's promise to never, ever give in
to our lesser desires.


769
00:47:47.504 --> 00:47:50.302
After all, we're not married.

770
00:47:58.548 --> 00:48:00.709
I'm ready for sex.

771
00:48:09.192 --> 00:48:11.990
I been waiting for this for so long.

772
00:48:12.195 --> 00:48:13.389
Me too.

773
00:48:13.597 --> 00:48:15.861
From the moment I laid eyes on you.

774
00:48:27.210 --> 00:48:28.700
Oh, my.

775
00:48:34.017 --> 00:48:35.507
Dewey, I'm nervous.

776
00:48:35.719 --> 00:48:39.485
Don't worry, angel.
I'll show you the ways of love.


777
00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:45.825
Whoops-a-daisy.

778
00:48:47.564 --> 00:48:48.656
Oh, Dewey.

779
00:48:48.865 --> 00:48:50.856
Surprise!

780
00:48:51.168 --> 00:48:52.692
Edith!

781
00:48:53.236 --> 00:48:56.728
- Who are you?
- I'm his wife, that's who I am.


782
00:48:56.940 --> 00:48:59.170
No, you're not. I'm his-

783
00:49:00.410 --> 00:49:03.345
- Good Lord, you're already married?
- I can explain.


784
00:49:03.547 --> 00:49:07.608
Explain to her? You should explain
to me. I am the mother of your children.


785
00:49:07.818 --> 00:49:09.911
- It's not what it looks like.
- Children?


786
00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:11.553
It's not what it looks like.

787
00:49:11.755 --> 00:49:14.280
Not what it looks like to me,
or not what it looks like to her?


788
00:49:14.491 --> 00:49:17.255
It's gotta be the way it looks like
to at least one of us.


789
00:49:17.461 --> 00:49:18.553
We're married.

790
00:49:19.196 --> 00:49:21.721
I did the right thing.
It's not like we're not married.


791
00:49:21.932 --> 00:49:24.127
If you're married,
you can't get married again.


792
00:49:24.334 --> 00:49:27.565
I know, I know, and that was wrong,
but it's just...


793
00:49:28.338 --> 00:49:30.203
We were such good friends.

794
00:49:30.407 --> 00:49:33.399
You told me about that dream
where you were licking my balls...


795
00:49:33.610 --> 00:49:36.340
...and that seemed like a signal,
and...


796
00:49:36.613 --> 00:49:37.637
I forgot.

797
00:49:38.115 --> 00:49:42.108
I'm leaving you, Dewey Cox,
and I will see you in court!


798
00:49:42.319 --> 00:49:44.446
No, Edith! Don't go!

799
00:49:46.523 --> 00:49:49.151
Oh, well. She's gone now.

800
00:49:49.659 --> 00:49:54.392
I'm leaving too. You got the order
of things all backwards.


801
00:49:54.598 --> 00:49:56.429
Darlene, don't go!

802
00:49:56.633 --> 00:49:58.362
Edith, don't go either!

803
00:49:59.803 --> 00:50:04.001
I made a mistake.
I made a terrible mistake.


804
00:50:05.275 --> 00:50:08.039
Edith! Edith! Edith!

805
00:50:08.245 --> 00:50:10.839
- Leave me alone, Dewey.
- I never meant no harm to you.


806
00:50:11.047 --> 00:50:13.311
Edith. Cupcake.

807
00:50:13.517 --> 00:50:17.419
Baby, you don't know what it's like out
there on the road. It's lonely out there.


808
00:50:17.954 --> 00:50:19.478
Edith, I can't be alone.

809
00:50:19.689 --> 00:50:23.125
Maybe you should've thought of that
before you got double married.


810
00:50:23.593 --> 00:50:25.788
Is that what this is about?

811
00:50:25.996 --> 00:50:29.625
Don't you stand there and judge me
like I'm some kind of criminal.


812
00:50:29.833 --> 00:50:32.597
You are a criminal.
This is illegal, Dewey.


813
00:50:32.802 --> 00:50:33.996
What do you mean?

814
00:50:34.204 --> 00:50:37.731
It's illegal to be married to two people
at the same time, Dewey.


815
00:50:38.308 --> 00:50:41.243
What about if you're famous?
Is that-?


816
00:50:41.912 --> 00:50:44.005
You never done nothing
you shouldn't have done?


817
00:50:44.214 --> 00:50:45.442
What have I ever done?

818
00:50:45.649 --> 00:50:48.379
You woke up in the middle
of the night and drank the milk.


819
00:50:48.585 --> 00:50:50.849
I got up to have my cornflakes,
there's none left.


820
00:50:51.054 --> 00:50:52.521
Dewey, you cheated on me!

821
00:50:52.722 --> 00:50:55.350
So I'm a cheater,
but you can just drink up all the milk.


822
00:50:55.559 --> 00:50:58.926
Okay. All right, that's fine, I get it.
You're innocent, and I'm guilty.


823
00:50:59.129 --> 00:51:01.188
Guilty as charged.

824
00:51:01.698 --> 00:51:03.825
Guilty as charged

825
00:51:04.034 --> 00:51:06.332
Don't you dare write a song
right now, Dewey!


826
00:51:06.703 --> 00:51:10.571
You know what? Go ahead.
Take the children. I don't care.


827
00:51:11.141 --> 00:51:12.631
All I need is my music.

828
00:51:12.842 --> 00:51:14.104
I don't need you.

829
00:51:14.311 --> 00:51:16.006
And I don't need you.

830
00:51:16.213 --> 00:51:17.373
And I don't need you.

831
00:51:18.348 --> 00:51:19.906
And I don't need you.

832
00:51:20.116 --> 00:51:23.085
You're just sitting there
all high and mighty in your diaper.


833
00:51:23.286 --> 00:51:26.813
If anything, you need me.
You're a baby.


834
00:51:27.057 --> 00:51:28.046
Come on, Miles.

835
00:51:29.793 --> 00:51:31.317
Don't you dare take Miles.

836
00:51:31.528 --> 00:51:35.555
You can take the children,
but you leave me my monkey.


837
00:51:36.099 --> 00:51:37.566
Fine.

838
00:51:38.134 --> 00:51:40.364
Goodbye, Dewey Cox.

839
00:51:40.904 --> 00:51:42.565
No! No, come back.

840
00:51:43.139 --> 00:51:44.731
Don't leave me, Edith.

841
00:51:44.941 --> 00:51:48.843
"Don't leave me, Edith. "
There's a title for a song.


842
00:51:51.781 --> 00:51:56.741
That's not a bad title,
but please don't leave me.


843
00:51:57.354 --> 00:51:58.548
What have you done?

844
00:52:06.029 --> 00:52:08.964
I'm telling you, I've had it.
I've had it with all this crap.


845
00:52:09.165 --> 00:52:10.462
You took her side every time.

846
00:52:10.667 --> 00:52:14.103
All you care about is fruit
and touching yourself. Well, fuck you.


847
00:52:15.705 --> 00:52:17.866
Get out of here.
You don't want no part of this.


848
00:52:18.074 --> 00:52:21.566
- What y'all doing in here?
- We doing pills, uppers and downers.


849
00:52:21.778 --> 00:52:23.541
They're the logical next step for you.

850
00:52:23.747 --> 00:52:25.408
I want some of that shit.

851
00:52:28.018 --> 00:52:31.283
Good morning, Your Honor.
May I approach the bench?


852
00:52:36.960 --> 00:52:39.758
I don't give a damn
What anyone thinks


853
00:52:42.565 --> 00:52:45.728
I stay up all night
And I smoke and I drink


854
00:52:47.604 --> 00:52:50.903
I'm a wanted man
And I'm blowin' town


855
00:52:51.107 --> 00:52:53.974
Don't waste your time
Tryin' to hunt me down


856
00:52:56.079 --> 00:53:00.709
The cops are sayin'
I belong behind bars


857
00:53:00.917 --> 00:53:02.817
And I'm guilty

858
00:53:03.019 --> 00:53:05.010
Guilty

859
00:53:05.655 --> 00:53:07.282
I'm guilty as charged

860
00:53:09.426 --> 00:53:11.257
Does Dewey seem unhappy to you?

861
00:53:13.196 --> 00:53:15.391
He's changed, I tell you,
he's changed.


862
00:53:15.598 --> 00:53:18.192
That was early Dewey,
this is middle Dewey.


863
00:53:19.469 --> 00:53:21.664
Dewey, are you enjoying yourself?

864
00:53:21.871 --> 00:53:25.671
What? Oh, I'm sorry.
I forgot you were here.


865
00:53:25.875 --> 00:53:28.173
Hey, Dave. I like your girl better,
let's switch.


866
00:53:28.845 --> 00:53:32.178
- Well, Dewey, this is my wife.
- Oh, nice to meet you.


867
00:53:32.382 --> 00:53:34.475
Well, this is Kathy.
Kathy, this is Dave.


868
00:53:34.684 --> 00:53:37.346
Come on, darling.
So where you from?


869
00:53:40.023 --> 00:53:41.149
Hi there.

870
00:53:41.358 --> 00:53:43.189
Guilty

871
00:53:43.393 --> 00:53:46.055
I'm guilty as charged

872
00:53:47.697 --> 00:53:50.291
I ain't askin' 
God to forgive my sins

873
00:53:50.500 --> 00:53:53.162
Take a good look
And you'll know where I've been


874
00:53:53.370 --> 00:53:56.032
I'm dancin' with the devil
Every night and every day


875
00:53:56.373 --> 00:53:59.467
People pay attention to the things
That I say


876
00:53:59.676 --> 00:54:00.665
Say

877
00:54:01.044 --> 00:54:04.275
Hey, Jerry, I'm a long-time listener
and a first-time caller.


878
00:54:04.481 --> 00:54:07.973
Yeah, I just wanted to say
I love the show, keep it up.


879
00:54:08.184 --> 00:54:09.947
Am I on the radio right now?

880
00:54:10.453 --> 00:54:13.115
I'm guilty as charged

881
00:54:14.491 --> 00:54:18.985
If you're sayin' my love is too large

882
00:54:19.195 --> 00:54:20.253
Then I'm guilty

883
00:54:21.798 --> 00:54:25.529
Goddamn it,
this is a dark fucking period!


884
00:54:26.369 --> 00:54:27.836
Oh, I'm guilty

885
00:54:28.037 --> 00:54:31.097
- Freeze! Hands above your head.
- It's not what it looks like.


886
00:54:31.307 --> 00:54:33.434
I'm guilty as charged

887
00:54:33.643 --> 00:54:34.632
Stop!

888
00:54:35.278 --> 00:54:36.870
You got me.

889
00:54:37.080 --> 00:54:39.913
Come on, Mr. Cox. How about it?
Look here.


890
00:54:40.116 --> 00:54:47.750
I'm guilty as charged

891
00:54:56.399 --> 00:54:59.334
Cox, you got a visitor.

892
00:55:02.038 --> 00:55:04.097
Prison has changed me.

893
00:55:04.607 --> 00:55:07.633
I understand the common man
in a way I never did before.


894
00:55:08.912 --> 00:55:13.508
I gotta get out of here, so I can
bring joy to the men back in here.


895
00:55:13.716 --> 00:55:16.014
But I don't wanna live with them.

896
00:55:16.686 --> 00:55:17.948
Lean closer.

897
00:55:19.956 --> 00:55:22.288
I'm going to speak to you
in my language...


898
00:55:22.525 --> 00:55:26.154
...so that the guards can't understand
what I'm saying.


899
00:55:27.197 --> 00:55:29.222
There must be something you can do.

900
00:55:29.432 --> 00:55:31.730
I'm 21 years old.

901
00:55:31.935 --> 00:55:34.665
I got my whole life ahead of me...

902
00:55:34.871 --> 00:55:38.500
We think we can get you off.

903
00:55:39.042 --> 00:55:40.031
What do I have to do?

904
00:55:40.376 --> 00:55:43.072
You gotta go to rehab.

905
00:55:43.847 --> 00:55:45.508
- "Rehab"?
- Rehab.


906
00:55:48.384 --> 00:55:51.717
- Rehab?
- Oh, rehab. Okay, okay, I gotcha.


907
00:55:53.423 --> 00:55:56.051
Doctor! Doctor!

908
00:55:57.260 --> 00:55:59.524
- I'm so cold.
- We need more blankets.


909
00:55:59.729 --> 00:56:01.287
We need more blankets.

910
00:56:02.131 --> 00:56:03.655
Doctor!

911
00:56:03.867 --> 00:56:06.734
- I'm so hot!
- I think he has too many blankets.


912
00:56:06.936 --> 00:56:07.960
Fewer blankets!

913
00:56:08.738 --> 00:56:10.933
I'm hot and cold at the same time!

914
00:56:11.140 --> 00:56:14.007
He needs more blankets
and he needs less blankets.


915
00:56:14.210 --> 00:56:15.939
I'm afraid you're right.

916
00:56:16.145 --> 00:56:17.339
Dewey?

917
00:56:17.680 --> 00:56:19.807
My wife sends her love...

918
00:56:20.016 --> 00:56:21.244
...asshole.

919
00:56:21.451 --> 00:56:26.013
Dewey, tall and powerful

920
00:56:27.590 --> 00:56:30.889
Dewey, I don't know if you can
hear me in there...


921
00:56:32.762 --> 00:56:34.957
...but the wrong kid died.

922
00:56:36.699 --> 00:56:39.429
Dewey. Do you mind
if we get stoned in here?


923
00:56:39.636 --> 00:56:43.163
He can't hear you.
He's gonna die anyway.


924
00:57:01.658 --> 00:57:04.456
Are you ready to go home,
Dewey Cox?


925
00:57:06.062 --> 00:57:07.393
Darlene.

926
00:57:07.730 --> 00:57:10.028
I could never get you
out of my head.


927
00:57:13.002 --> 00:57:14.993
Me neither.

928
00:57:15.204 --> 00:57:17.434
I could never stop
thinking about you.


929
00:57:17.640 --> 00:57:20.404
But I wasn't gonna be
no home wrecker.


930
00:57:20.610 --> 00:57:25.047
Now that I'm your only wife though,
it seems different.


931
00:57:25.248 --> 00:57:30.117
I'm a new man, Darlene.
Prison and rehab have changed me.


932
00:57:30.486 --> 00:57:33.387
All these blankets
have saved my life.


933
00:57:33.623 --> 00:57:37.457
I think you're finally ready to be
the man I always thought you could be.


934
00:58:17.500 --> 00:58:19.127
Let me get this off.

935
00:58:26.142 --> 00:58:27.575
I love you.

936
00:58:27.777 --> 00:58:28.835
I love you too.

937
00:58:38.154 --> 00:58:42.056
Oh, my God.

938
00:58:50.133 --> 00:58:52.192
Oh, don't stop.

939
00:58:52.402 --> 00:58:55.769
Don't stop. Don't stop, Dewey.

940
00:58:55.972 --> 00:58:57.462
Oh, God.

941
00:58:59.342 --> 00:59:02.072
Oh, yes!

942
00:59:12.922 --> 00:59:14.822
Hey, boys, have you seen Dewey?

943
00:59:15.024 --> 00:59:17.549
I think I saw him in the barn
with Wavy Gravy


944
00:59:17.760 --> 00:59:19.625
I saw him by the creek
talking to Donovan.


945
00:59:19.829 --> 00:59:23.424
No, I think he was painting
a portrait with Joni Mitchell.


946
00:59:29.105 --> 00:59:31.073
Jerry Garcia, brother,
have you seen Dewey?


947
00:59:31.274 --> 00:59:33.640
I think I saw him in the study,
Sister Darlene.


948
00:59:33.843 --> 00:59:35.504
Thanks, Jerry Garcia.

949
00:59:36.579 --> 00:59:40.640
Hey! Casey, Jones,
watch your speed.


950
00:59:46.155 --> 00:59:49.318
Come on, Dewey. It's almost time
for Dewman's cake.


951
00:59:49.525 --> 00:59:54.053
All right. It's just- It's hard for me
to sit around at some birthday party...


952
00:59:54.263 --> 00:59:57.289
...when I know there's so much
injustice going on in this world.


953
00:59:57.500 --> 00:59:59.593
- I know.
- My daddy was right.


954
00:59:59.802 --> 01:00:02.532
I can't spend all my time
thinking about Dewey Cox no more.


955
01:00:02.739 --> 01:00:04.570
I've got to think about
the other people.


956
01:00:05.007 --> 01:00:06.065
Like your family?

957
01:00:06.843 --> 01:00:11.507
No, I mean, like, people that's having
injustices done to them.


958
01:00:11.881 --> 01:00:13.974
Like women and midgets and such.

959
01:00:14.183 --> 01:00:17.675
I mean, it's 1966, Darlene.
And, baby...


960
01:00:21.090 --> 01:00:22.580
...I'm feeling it.

961
01:00:23.025 --> 01:00:26.392
I know. The '60s are an important
and exciting time.


962
01:00:26.596 --> 01:00:29.895
Aren't they? It's like there's
something happening here.


963
01:00:30.099 --> 01:00:33.728
And what it is ain't exactly...

964
01:00:35.404 --> 01:00:36.393
...obvious.

965
01:00:36.606 --> 01:00:39.268
I have to try to help people
with my music.


966
01:00:39.475 --> 01:00:43.536
Some people are saying that your new
music sounds a lot like Bob Dylan.


967
01:00:43.746 --> 01:00:45.714
Well, maybe Bob Dylan
sounds a lot like me.


968
01:00:45.915 --> 01:00:47.644
How come nobody
ever asks Bob Dylan:


969
01:00:47.850 --> 01:00:49.750
"Why you sound
so much like Dewey Cox?"


970
01:00:49.952 --> 01:00:55.447
Mailboxes drip like lampposts in
The twisted birth canal of the coliseum


971
01:00:57.627 --> 01:01:01.563
Rimjob fairy teapots
Mask the temper tantrum


972
01:01:01.764 --> 01:01:03.891
Oh, say can you see 'em?

973
01:01:04.967 --> 01:01:08.903
Stuffed cabbage is the darling
Of the Laundromat


974
01:01:09.839 --> 01:01:13.775
The mouse with the overbite explained
How the rabbits were ensnared


975
01:01:14.143 --> 01:01:16.407
What the hell is this song about?

976
01:01:16.612 --> 01:01:18.204
I have no idea.

977
01:01:18.414 --> 01:01:22.714
You guys are idiots.
This song is very deep.


978
01:01:22.919 --> 01:01:29.324
Inside the three-eyed monkey
Within inches of his toaster-oven life


979
01:01:29.525 --> 01:01:31.925
What do your parents think about
your protest songs?


980
01:01:32.128 --> 01:01:35.495
What do your parents think about
my protest songs, Mr. TIME Magazine?


981
01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:40.501
All the elevator buttons

982
01:01:41.904 --> 01:01:44.498
So incredibly high

983
01:01:44.707 --> 01:01:47.699
I stand today for the midget

984
01:01:48.477 --> 01:01:51.969
Half the size of a regular guy

985
01:01:52.949 --> 01:01:56.510
Let me hold you, little man

986
01:01:56.719 --> 01:01:59.711
As the parade passes by

987
01:02:00.556 --> 01:02:03.719
Let me hold you, little man

988
01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:07.552
We'll make believe you can fly

989
01:02:07.763 --> 01:02:09.492
You shout for me to put you down

990
01:02:12.568 --> 01:02:15.093
But I'm marching today
For your cause


991
01:02:15.304 --> 01:02:19.138
I'm banging the drum
Your big day will come


992
01:02:19.342 --> 01:02:21.936
When they remake The Wizard of Oz

993
01:02:25.014 --> 01:02:28.677
So let me hold you, midget man

994
01:02:29.118 --> 01:02:32.519
Pretend that you're flying in space

995
01:02:33.222 --> 01:02:36.385
Let me hold you, midget man

996
01:02:36.592 --> 01:02:39.390
So the dog will stop licking your face

997
01:02:40.229 --> 01:02:41.890
Sing with me!

998
01:02:43.666 --> 01:02:44.690
Sing it!

999
01:02:44.901 --> 01:02:46.892
Mr. Cox, why are you going to India?

1000
01:02:47.103 --> 01:02:51.005
Well, I'm searching for something,
if you must know.


1001
01:02:51.207 --> 01:02:53.675
I'm fixing to do some meditating
with the maharishi.


1002
01:02:53.876 --> 01:02:56.344
And Dewey Cox needs India
right now...


1003
01:02:56.545 --> 01:02:59.537
...and, heck, I reckon India
needs Dewey Cox too.


1004
01:03:01.951 --> 01:03:06.945
Only through meditation can we
begin to understand our role.


1005
01:03:07.423 --> 01:03:11.223
We're nothing but grains of sand.

1006
01:03:11.427 --> 01:03:13.827
That was freaking transcendental,
Paul McCartney.


1007
01:03:14.030 --> 01:03:16.396
- Don't you agree, John Lennon?
- Yes, Dewey Cox.


1008
01:03:16.799 --> 01:03:19.962
With meditation there's no limit
to what we can...


1009
01:03:20.169 --> 01:03:21.534
...imagine.

1010
01:03:21.737 --> 01:03:23.534
What do you think, 
George Harrison?

1011
01:03:23.739 --> 01:03:27.436
I don't know. I'm just trying to get some
more songs on the album, you know.


1012
01:03:27.643 --> 01:03:30.908
And as Ringo Starr,
I'm not so interested in meditation.


1013
01:03:31.113 --> 01:03:33.172
I just like to have fun.

1014
01:03:34.317 --> 01:03:36.785
- I like the little one.
- It's so dark in this tent.


1015
01:03:36.986 --> 01:03:40.444
Reminds me when we, the Beatles,
the four Beatles, us-


1016
01:03:40.656 --> 01:03:42.749
- From Liverpool.
- Yes, we are from Liverpool.


1017
01:03:42.959 --> 01:03:46.918
We used to play those dark clubs
in Hamburg. Remember that, Paul?


1018
01:03:47.129 --> 01:03:51.429
Of course I do, I booked them.
I'm the leader of the Beatles.


1019
01:03:51.634 --> 01:03:54.660
Well, I have to say I like your stuff.
It's pretty good.


1020
01:03:54.870 --> 01:03:57.134
And most of your records,
I really enjoy.


1021
01:03:57.340 --> 01:03:59.240
We're big fans of your records too.

1022
01:03:59.442 --> 01:04:02.468
We like to think that Hard Day's Night
is our Guilty as Charged.


1023
01:04:02.678 --> 01:04:04.612
- Great record.
- Excellent album.


1024
01:04:04.814 --> 01:04:06.805
- We learned a lot from you.
- Great record.


1025
01:04:07.016 --> 01:04:08.643
- We're big fans of y'all.
- Huge fans.


1026
01:04:08.851 --> 01:04:11.445
You're almost as good as the Monkees.
You guys are great.


1027
01:04:13.022 --> 01:04:16.617
I think I might adjourn to another
dimension, take some LSD.


1028
01:04:16.826 --> 01:04:19.226
- Do you care to join me?
- Yeah, let's do that.


1029
01:04:19.428 --> 01:04:21.896
Care to join us for some LSD?
It's good for you.


1030
01:04:22.098 --> 01:04:25.465
- Built by scientists, it is.
- Lysergic.


1031
01:04:26.102 --> 01:04:27.729
Gotta check with headquarters.

1032
01:04:27.937 --> 01:04:30.132
Come on, Dewey Cox.
Think you might enjoy it.


1033
01:04:30.339 --> 01:04:33.831
Open your mind to a new experience,
a new level of consciousness...


1034
01:04:34.043 --> 01:04:35.908
...like we do,
because we are the Beatles.


1035
01:04:36.112 --> 01:04:38.774
Let him decide.
If he wants to take LSD, he'll take it.


1036
01:04:38.981 --> 01:04:41.176
He doesn't have to listen to you.
You're not the boss of him.


1037
01:04:41.384 --> 01:04:43.944
Don't tell me what to say
and what not to say, Paul McCartney.


1038
01:04:44.153 --> 01:04:48.487
I'm sick of you being so dark when I'm
so impish and whimsical. I'm sick of it.


1039
01:04:48.691 --> 01:04:51.888
Hey, everyone,
I've got a brand-new mantra:


1040
01:04:52.094 --> 01:04:53.652
Paul's a big fat cunt.

1041
01:04:53.863 --> 01:04:56.195
Don't know why you
don't let me write more songs.


1042
01:04:56.399 --> 01:04:59.800
You know, I just sit here while me
guitar quietly whimpers, you know.


1043
01:05:00.002 --> 01:05:02.596
You are the quiet one,
so why don't you shut the fuck up?


1044
01:05:02.805 --> 01:05:04.500
I've got a song about an octopus.

1045
01:05:04.707 --> 01:05:07.642
Jam it up your ass. You're lucky
we still let you play drums.


1046
01:05:07.843 --> 01:05:11.609
Wow, seems like there's a rift
happening between the Beatles.


1047
01:05:11.814 --> 01:05:14.806
I wonder if your songs will
still be shit when I'm 64.


1048
01:05:15.017 --> 01:05:16.450
- Great sod.
- No, stop it!


1049
01:05:16.652 --> 01:05:17.983
You bastard! You sissy.

1050
01:05:18.187 --> 01:05:21.452
Beatles. Please stop fighting
here in India.


1051
01:05:21.657 --> 01:05:23.648
No, no, let them go.
Let them work it out.


1052
01:05:23.859 --> 01:05:24.848
Taste it.

1053
01:05:25.061 --> 01:05:26.653
Right there in the bollocks.

1054
01:05:27.196 --> 01:05:29.391
- Bastard!
- Cunt!


1055
01:05:30.232 --> 01:05:33.030
Dewey, you been living clean
for three years now...


1056
01:05:33.235 --> 01:05:35.465
...and it's done you a world of good,
has it not?


1057
01:05:35.671 --> 01:05:37.764
I know I've had trouble
with drugs in the past.


1058
01:05:37.973 --> 01:05:42.535
But I'm addicted to coke, weed, booze,
ludes and speed. Not LSD.


1059
01:05:42.745 --> 01:05:45.111
Nobody gets addicted to LSD.

1060
01:05:45.314 --> 01:05:48.147
It was invented by scientists.
Ringo Starr just told me.


1061
01:05:48.350 --> 01:05:51.148
I heard that doing LSD
can awaken your demons.


1062
01:05:51.821 --> 01:05:55.279
I ain't got no demons
gonna get woke.


1063
01:05:57.059 --> 01:05:59.994
If you promise
it'll just be this one time.


1064
01:06:02.064 --> 01:06:03.622
Okay.

1065
01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:06.566
Let's go drop acid with the Beatles.

1066
01:06:17.179 --> 01:06:18.237
Hello, Dewey.

1067
01:06:18.447 --> 01:06:21.177
Welcome to your LSD trip.

1068
01:06:21.383 --> 01:06:23.681
Where everything's a cartoon.

1069
01:06:23.886 --> 01:06:26.446
We're the trippy cartoon Beatles.

1070
01:06:26.655 --> 01:06:29.215
Look at that. It's a flying fish.

1071
01:06:29.425 --> 01:06:31.120
Totally trippy!

1072
01:06:32.394 --> 01:06:34.828
Wow, this LSD's all right.

1073
01:06:35.030 --> 01:06:37.123
I like being a trippy cartoon.

1074
01:06:37.333 --> 01:06:39.893
Just keep thinking
happy thoughts, Dewey.


1075
01:06:40.102 --> 01:06:43.230
I'd hate for this
to turn into a bad trip.


1076
01:06:45.274 --> 01:06:46.832
What's that scary music?

1077
01:06:48.010 --> 01:06:50.171
I had an unhappy thought.

1078
01:06:50.379 --> 01:06:51.812
It's a bad trip.

1079
01:06:52.014 --> 01:06:53.504
Bad trip, bad trip!

1080
01:06:53.716 --> 01:06:56.651
Help! Trippy machete!

1081
01:06:57.753 --> 01:07:00.813
Oh, fuck me.
I can see my large colon.


1082
01:07:02.057 --> 01:07:03.922
I guess I do have some demons.

1083
01:07:04.126 --> 01:07:05.616
You all right, Cox?

1084
01:07:05.828 --> 01:07:07.090
I don't know.

1085
01:07:07.296 --> 01:07:09.730
Do you want some more LSD?

1086
01:07:09.932 --> 01:07:12.765
Yeah. I think I do.

1087
01:07:18.607 --> 01:07:22.873
Mr. Schwartzberg, you're his long-time
manager. Maybe you can talk to him.


1088
01:07:23.078 --> 01:07:24.773
Well, what's the problem?

1089
01:07:24.980 --> 01:07:27.540
He's been on that trampoline
for four days.


1090
01:07:27.750 --> 01:07:30.776
You have got to talk some sense
into him. I'm worried.


1091
01:07:32.555 --> 01:07:36.753
Dewey, as your manager,
I have to tell you I'm concerned.


1092
01:07:36.959 --> 01:07:39.120
I think the LSD has changed you.

1093
01:07:39.328 --> 01:07:42.889
It has changed me.
It's opened my mind right up.


1094
01:07:43.098 --> 01:07:44.565
I'm reinventing music.

1095
01:07:44.767 --> 01:07:47.827
I'm creating something new
that I call "shmusic. "


1096
01:07:48.037 --> 01:07:51.529
You've recorded the same song for
months. You're not close to finished.


1097
01:07:51.740 --> 01:07:54.368
Because this record is different
than any other I've made.


1098
01:07:54.577 --> 01:07:57.011
I told you. This is going to be
my masterpiece.


1099
01:07:57.213 --> 01:07:59.443
The one I'm remembered by.
It's for my brother.


1100
01:07:59.715 --> 01:08:00.773
What brother?

1101
01:08:00.983 --> 01:08:03.451
Nothing. Never mind. It's private.

1102
01:08:03.652 --> 01:08:06.416
I've got this sound in my head
and it's trying to get out.


1103
01:08:06.622 --> 01:08:10.183
I can't find it on this human plane of
existence. I've got to keep searching.


1104
01:08:11.293 --> 01:08:14.990
But I'll tell you what,
I'm gonna find it.


1105
01:08:23.072 --> 01:08:25.734
You guys should make friends.
He's a wonderful man.


1106
01:08:25.941 --> 01:08:29.399
Professor, good morning.
All right, everyone. Thank you.


1107
01:08:29.878 --> 01:08:31.971
I've just been outside,
I had a little bounce.


1108
01:08:32.181 --> 01:08:35.173
What we're going to do is
run through the entire piece...


1109
01:08:35.384 --> 01:08:37.284
...in our minds, silently.

1110
01:08:37.486 --> 01:08:39.454
And...

1111
01:08:39.655 --> 01:08:40.986
...begin.

1112
01:08:41.657 --> 01:08:43.852
As we sit here together
on Thanksgiving...


1113
01:08:44.059 --> 01:08:45.822
...on our beautiful trampoline...

1114
01:08:46.028 --> 01:08:50.158
...I think we should take a moment to
think about what it's like to be a turkey.


1115
01:08:50.399 --> 01:08:53.197
Gobble, gobble, gobble.
Gobble, gobble, gobble.


1116
01:08:53.402 --> 01:08:55.233
"Hi, I'm just a little turkey. "

1117
01:08:55.437 --> 01:08:57.962
Just cut the damn bird, boy.

1118
01:08:59.074 --> 01:09:02.475
Dewey? Can we just enjoy
our Thanksgiving dinner?


1119
01:09:02.678 --> 01:09:07.274
You think you're so great
sitting there all drugged up...


1120
01:09:07.483 --> 01:09:09.280
...on your trampoline.

1121
01:09:09.485 --> 01:09:11.680
You're the black sheep
of this family.


1122
01:09:12.054 --> 01:09:13.885
You call yourself a Cox.

1123
01:09:14.089 --> 01:09:15.989
Until you get right with Jesus...

1124
01:09:16.191 --> 01:09:20.150
...you'll never be nothing
but a big, black Cox.


1125
01:09:23.265 --> 01:09:25.859
Nothing I do will ever please you,
will it?


1126
01:09:26.368 --> 01:09:30.236
We're both Cox, Pa.
Both of us are Cox.


1127
01:09:30.439 --> 01:09:33.840
I've got 137 musicians
waiting on me.


1128
01:09:34.043 --> 01:09:36.034
You'll have to excuse me.

1129
01:09:36.779 --> 01:09:38.076
Dewey, watch the turkey.

1130
01:09:44.853 --> 01:09:46.844
I wasn't dreaming

1131
01:09:47.056 --> 01:09:48.683
Barely awake

1132
01:09:49.391 --> 01:09:52.724
Off to the grinder we stroll

1133
01:09:54.029 --> 01:09:55.428
This is not a good song.

1134
01:09:55.864 --> 01:09:59.129
It's like five songs on top
of each other at the same time.


1135
01:09:59.335 --> 01:10:02.065
Not even a song.
It's some kind of concerto.


1136
01:10:02.304 --> 01:10:03.532
Just let him work it out.

1137
01:10:04.573 --> 01:10:06.268
Masterpieces take time.

1138
01:10:07.476 --> 01:10:09.501
Do you hear that?
That goat's been singing...


1139
01:10:09.712 --> 01:10:12.112
...more than I am on this damn song.

1140
01:10:17.686 --> 01:10:18.812
Well?

1141
01:10:19.021 --> 01:10:21.819
That was beautiful, Dewey.
It was perfection.


1142
01:10:22.024 --> 01:10:24.618
Yeah, even the goat was perfect.

1143
01:10:24.827 --> 01:10:27.352
Yeah, the goat was good.
Were the strings tangy enough?


1144
01:10:27.563 --> 01:10:29.554
Oh, they were tangy.
They were very tangy.


1145
01:10:29.765 --> 01:10:31.460
Unbelievably tangy.

1146
01:10:31.667 --> 01:10:34.636
No, guys, the strings were not tangy!
They were salty!


1147
01:10:34.837 --> 01:10:36.361
Am I crazy?

1148
01:10:36.572 --> 01:10:39.097
Let's do one more time.
Okay, strings, lean into it.


1149
01:10:39.308 --> 01:10:42.141
I want it really tangy this time.
Now, Mike, you're flatting.


1150
01:10:42.344 --> 01:10:46.337
Bushmen, make it sound like
you're in the fucking bush, okay?


1151
01:10:46.548 --> 01:10:48.641
Back off the goat
on the second pre-chorus.


1152
01:10:48.851 --> 01:10:50.614
I wanna hear his heart, not his soul.

1153
01:10:50.819 --> 01:10:53.686
Sam, go back to that thing you did
yesterday on the bridge.


1154
01:10:53.889 --> 01:10:57.154
- What did I do?
- It sounded like velvet pancakes.


1155
01:10:57.359 --> 01:11:00.021
- Yeah, right.
- Okay, everybody, one more time.


1156
01:11:00.229 --> 01:11:02.493
What on earth is a velvet pancake?

1157
01:11:02.698 --> 01:11:07.465
It's the LSD.
I think it's having an effect on him.


1158
01:11:07.669 --> 01:11:10.536
From the top of the overture.
Slate it.


1159
01:11:10.906 --> 01:11:14.000
"Black Sheep," take 112.

1160
01:11:14.209 --> 01:11:17.303
One, and a two,
and a five, six, seven, eight.


1161
01:11:20.048 --> 01:11:22.949
I just close my eyes
When I fantasize


1162
01:11:23.152 --> 01:11:26.383
Much to my surprise
I'm only half the size


1163
01:11:26.588 --> 01:11:28.453
That I used to be

1164
01:11:30.392 --> 01:11:33.657
Bye-bye, white brother

1165
01:11:33.862 --> 01:11:37.457
This black sheep gotta roll

1166
01:11:37.666 --> 01:11:39.793
It's on the beat!

1167
01:11:41.103 --> 01:11:43.037
I just open up
Like a catacomb


1168
01:11:43.238 --> 01:11:47.072
Though my heart is half
From the half-F tone


1169
01:11:47.876 --> 01:11:49.776
That tickles.

1170
01:11:50.679 --> 01:11:55.173
Bye-bye, pastures of plenty

1171
01:11:55.717 --> 01:11:58.982
I don't know where I will

1172
01:11:59.188 --> 01:12:01.816
- Roam
- Black sheep, black sheep


1173
01:12:02.925 --> 01:12:04.552
Like that, with some urgency.

1174
01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:08.196
Not, "I'm in the yard.
I wanna go outside. "


1175
01:12:08.397 --> 01:12:12.834
Like, "I'm about to die. " Like that.

1176
01:12:13.035 --> 01:12:14.764
The blade has been swung

1177
01:12:14.970 --> 01:12:17.734
Black sheep, black sheep

1178
01:12:19.875 --> 01:12:21.775
All right? Here we go.

1179
01:12:23.378 --> 01:12:25.437
Push. Push, baby, push.

1180
01:12:25.948 --> 01:12:27.415
- Are we recording this?
- No.


1181
01:12:27.616 --> 01:12:30.881
Well, we should be. Get a microphone.
Push, baby.


1182
01:12:31.086 --> 01:12:32.451
Push.

1183
01:12:32.654 --> 01:12:34.747
Push! Push!

1184
01:12:36.558 --> 01:12:39.925
I'm losin' my fleece from tryin'

1185
01:12:40.128 --> 01:12:43.427
I'm losin' no sleep
I'm dyin'


1186
01:12:43.665 --> 01:12:47.795
Why shouldn't I keep from cryin'?

1187
01:12:48.604 --> 01:12:50.663
Cryin'

1188
01:12:50.873 --> 01:12:54.172
I'm losin' my fleece from tryin'

1189
01:12:54.376 --> 01:12:57.709
I'm losin' no sleep
I'm dyin'


1190
01:12:57.913 --> 01:13:01.212
Why shouldn't I keep from cry-?

1191
01:13:06.555 --> 01:13:08.546
It's still not finished yet.

1192
01:13:09.224 --> 01:13:12.751
I'm hearing more
aboriginal percussionists.


1193
01:13:13.362 --> 01:13:17.594
And I want an army of didgeridoos.
Fifty thousand didgeridoos!


1194
01:13:17.799 --> 01:13:19.858
Folks, can we have a moment
with Dewey?


1195
01:13:22.971 --> 01:13:25.166
What the hell are these songs about?

1196
01:13:25.374 --> 01:13:27.672
You're singing about
cutting people in half-


1197
01:13:29.244 --> 01:13:32.771
I'm working something out.
It's called a metaphor.


1198
01:13:32.981 --> 01:13:34.414
Well, what are you working out?

1199
01:13:34.616 --> 01:13:36.914
It's secret.
That's why it's called metaphor.


1200
01:13:37.119 --> 01:13:38.848
That's what metaphor means. Secret.

1201
01:13:39.388 --> 01:13:42.152
I just don't see why you gotta
throw away the recipe, is all.


1202
01:13:42.357 --> 01:13:46.453
Why don't we just go in there, lay down
some tracks like we always done?


1203
01:13:46.662 --> 01:13:49.222
Yeah, why can't we just walk hard?

1204
01:13:49.431 --> 01:13:51.262
What do we need
all these people for?


1205
01:13:51.967 --> 01:13:55.061
I don't need people around me
stifling me.


1206
01:13:55.270 --> 01:13:58.603
So if you don't like it,
there's the door.


1207
01:13:59.841 --> 01:14:01.331
Dewey?

1208
01:14:02.077 --> 01:14:04.238
Are you saying
you don't need us no more?


1209
01:14:04.446 --> 01:14:10.180
Not unless you can open your mind
and learn to play the fucking theremin.


1210
01:14:12.387 --> 01:14:14.116
Fuck you, Dewey!

1211
01:14:14.656 --> 01:14:16.920
Yeah, fuck you, Dewey.

1212
01:14:17.125 --> 01:14:19.685
In 20 years not once have you
thrown a woman my way.


1213
01:14:19.895 --> 01:14:22.227
You don't think we like
cheating on our wives too?


1214
01:14:22.431 --> 01:14:25.423
And you never once paid for drugs.
Not once!


1215
01:14:25.634 --> 01:14:28.603
You pay that chimp
more than you pay us.


1216
01:14:28.804 --> 01:14:31.637
I had to borrow from the chimp
to get a mortgage on my house.


1217
01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:36.038
And those stupid Siamese glass cats
you get us every year for Christmas.


1218
01:14:36.244 --> 01:14:39.077
I don't want any more
Siamese glass cats!


1219
01:14:39.281 --> 01:14:42.273
The Siamese cat is a symbol of nobility
in ancient Egypt.


1220
01:14:42.484 --> 01:14:43.473
Fuck nobility!

1221
01:14:43.685 --> 01:14:45.550
Fuck ancient Egypt.

1222
01:14:46.054 --> 01:14:47.453
Fuck cats!

1223
01:14:47.656 --> 01:14:50.124
And you never paid for drugs.

1224
01:14:50.459 --> 01:14:51.790
Not once.

1225
01:14:51.994 --> 01:14:53.621
You slept with my wife.

1226
01:14:53.829 --> 01:14:55.023
You slept with me too!

1227
01:14:55.230 --> 01:14:58.461
And I've had confused feelings
about that for 10 years now!


1228
01:14:58.667 --> 01:15:01.067
And you never once paid for drugs.

1229
01:15:02.471 --> 01:15:03.438
Not once.

1230
01:15:04.139 --> 01:15:05.766
You're on your own, Dewey Cox.

1231
01:15:06.408 --> 01:15:07.500
We're leaving.

1232
01:15:09.611 --> 01:15:14.207
Well, I guess this is the end of
a chapter in your life, Dewey Cox.


1233
01:15:28.964 --> 01:15:30.522
What's happened to you,
Dewey Cox?


1234
01:15:30.732 --> 01:15:32.063
Stay out of this, Darlene!

1235
01:15:32.267 --> 01:15:34.735
You're driving away the people
who love you most!


1236
01:15:34.936 --> 01:15:36.961
I don't need anybody, Darlene.

1237
01:15:37.339 --> 01:15:39.239
All I need is my music.

1238
01:15:40.008 --> 01:15:44.536
This ain't about your music, Dewey.
It's about the drugs.


1239
01:15:44.746 --> 01:15:47.476
Honey, I told you
I'm gonna quit again.


1240
01:15:47.883 --> 01:15:49.976
As soon as the record's done.
Whenever that is.


1241
01:15:50.185 --> 01:15:51.880
Look, you can't rush a masterpiece.

1242
01:15:55.457 --> 01:15:58.654
You need to take a break. You need
to clean yourself up, otherwise-


1243
01:15:58.860 --> 01:16:00.054
Otherwise what?

1244
01:16:00.262 --> 01:16:02.730
Otherwise I can't be married
to you no more.


1245
01:16:04.433 --> 01:16:05.661
I know you don't mean that.

1246
01:16:06.301 --> 01:16:08.360
I believe you know that I do.

1247
01:16:13.608 --> 01:16:14.870
Okay.

1248
01:16:15.844 --> 01:16:18.779
- Okay?
- Okay.


1249
01:16:19.748 --> 01:16:20.908
You'll take a break?

1250
01:16:21.349 --> 01:16:23.214
I will take a break.

1251
01:16:23.618 --> 01:16:25.051
And you'll quit the drugs?

1252
01:16:25.954 --> 01:16:27.819
And I will quit the drugs.

1253
01:16:28.924 --> 01:16:30.118
Dewey!

1254
01:16:31.059 --> 01:16:35.496
Oh, baby. I've been praying
about this day for so long.


1255
01:16:36.131 --> 01:16:38.497
- What did you just put in your mouth?
- Gum.


1256
01:16:39.201 --> 01:16:42.432
- You ain't chewing no gum.
- Candy?


1257
01:16:42.637 --> 01:16:45.538
- What did you put in your mouth?
- It's PCP.


1258
01:16:45.741 --> 01:16:47.936
Oh, you just said-!

1259
01:16:50.979 --> 01:16:53.209
I'm going to town!

1260
01:16:59.321 --> 01:17:01.255
Get out of the road, you jerk!

1261
01:17:02.190 --> 01:17:03.214
Hey!

1262
01:17:04.326 --> 01:17:05.884
Hey! What's going on?

1263
01:17:16.838 --> 01:17:17.805
There he is!

1264
01:17:22.778 --> 01:17:27.238
Dewey! Get off that building!
It's inappropriate!


1265
01:17:29.684 --> 01:17:34.018
Dewey Cox, you give me no choice.

1266
01:17:34.222 --> 01:17:39.091
It breaks my heart,
but I'm leaving you.


1267
01:17:39.294 --> 01:17:40.556
I'm Zeus!

1268
01:17:43.064 --> 01:17:46.090
No mortal can stop me! I'm Zeus!

1269
01:17:49.871 --> 01:17:52.237
- Rehab?
- Rehab.


1270
01:18:02.317 --> 01:18:03.306
Nate!

1271
01:18:07.389 --> 01:18:08.947
Nate?

1272
01:18:09.157 --> 01:18:11.318
This is what I'd look like
if I'd grown up...


1273
01:18:11.893 --> 01:18:14.225
...and perhaps hadn't been murdered,
or whatever.


1274
01:18:14.729 --> 01:18:18.221
I just came to tell you
you need to get your shit together!


1275
01:18:18.433 --> 01:18:19.923
I know.

1276
01:18:20.135 --> 01:18:21.602
I've fallen again.

1277
01:18:21.803 --> 01:18:24.101
Listen to yourself.
Whining like a little bitch.


1278
01:18:24.306 --> 01:18:28.003
If I was alive right now, I'd be the
fucking president of the United States.


1279
01:18:28.210 --> 01:18:31.304
I'd be on the moon, walking around
looking for aliens to kill.


1280
01:18:31.513 --> 01:18:34.175
- What?
- You know why Dad liked me better?


1281
01:18:34.382 --> 01:18:36.179
Because I was better than you.

1282
01:18:36.384 --> 01:18:38.682
When I played the piano,
I was fucking awesome.


1283
01:18:38.887 --> 01:18:40.855
Well, you think
it's been easy for me?


1284
01:18:41.056 --> 01:18:43.047
Since you're gone
I got no sense of smell.


1285
01:18:43.258 --> 01:18:44.919
Oh, you got no sense of smell?

1286
01:18:45.827 --> 01:18:49.263
You can't smell anything?
You can't smell anything?


1287
01:18:49.464 --> 01:18:51.898
I got no sense of having legs,
Dewey!


1288
01:18:52.100 --> 01:18:55.331
I have no life!
I'm dead because somebody...


1289
01:18:55.537 --> 01:18:57.562
...I'm not gonna point out
names right now...


1290
01:18:57.772 --> 01:18:59.637
...decided to murder me
with a machete.


1291
01:18:59.841 --> 01:19:02.571
- Nate.
- I can't even smell, touch, feel.


1292
01:19:02.777 --> 01:19:06.679
I can't even masturbate. You ever try
to jerk off with a ghost hand? Nothing!


1293
01:19:08.450 --> 01:19:11.351
I'm just trying to say
you need to fix this shit.


1294
01:19:11.553 --> 01:19:14.818
You need to get out of that bathtub.
Start writing songs again.


1295
01:19:20.395 --> 01:19:22.260
Is he almost done
thinking about his life?


1296
01:19:22.464 --> 01:19:25.160
He just reached the '70s.

1297
01:19:43.485 --> 01:19:47.080
Schwartzy, I don't know. I don't know.
I don't know what's going on with me.


1298
01:19:47.289 --> 01:19:48.551
I got the song block.

1299
01:19:48.757 --> 01:19:49.781
Song block.

1300
01:19:49.991 --> 01:19:51.982
I don't need to write any new songs.

1301
01:19:52.193 --> 01:19:55.629
I'll just do my old ones. We'll do
a oldies tour. I'll do "Walk Hard. "


1302
01:19:55.830 --> 01:19:58.663
Dewey, "Walk Hard"
is over 20 years old.


1303
01:19:58.867 --> 01:20:01.165
Well, a lot of people like
my old songs.


1304
01:20:01.369 --> 01:20:03.200
Old people like your old songs.

1305
01:20:03.872 --> 01:20:04.964
May I make a suggestion?

1306
01:20:05.173 --> 01:20:07.198
Are you familiar with
the Donny & Marie show?


1307
01:20:07.409 --> 01:20:10.606
- The television show?
- I got a call from CBS.


1308
01:20:10.812 --> 01:20:13.406
They wanna do the same kind
of show with you.


1309
01:20:13.615 --> 01:20:17.073
I'm a serious musician.
I'm not some TV personality.


1310
01:20:17.285 --> 01:20:20.686
Well, why can't you be both? Look
at those goofy bastards on Hee Haw.


1311
01:20:21.189 --> 01:20:22.588
Well, I do love Hee Haw.

1312
01:20:22.791 --> 01:20:25.919
Television, Dewey. It's the way
into the people's hearts.


1313
01:20:26.561 --> 01:20:29.587
All right. You call them back today...

1314
01:20:29.798 --> 01:20:32.164
...and you tell Mr. CBS...

1315
01:20:32.367 --> 01:20:35.928
...that I will do it if I have
total creative control.


1316
01:20:36.137 --> 01:20:38.697
Dewey, you can't have
any creative control.


1317
01:20:40.408 --> 01:20:41.705
Okay.

1318
01:20:41.910 --> 01:20:44.879
All right, let's just do it then.
Fuck it, let's do it.


1319
01:20:45.180 --> 01:20:46.408
I'm bored.

1320
01:20:47.282 --> 01:20:50.342
Live from Burbank, California.

1321
01:20:50.552 --> 01:20:52.486
It's The Dewey Cox Show.

1322
01:20:53.154 --> 01:20:57.750
And now your host, Dewey Cox!

1323
01:20:57.959 --> 01:21:00.052
- Walk hard
- Hard


1324
01:21:00.261 --> 01:21:01.785
- Hard
- Hard


1325
01:21:01.997 --> 01:21:05.091
Down life's rocky road

1326
01:21:05.767 --> 01:21:07.860
- Walk bold
- Bold


1327
01:21:08.069 --> 01:21:09.434
- Hard
- Hard


1328
01:21:09.637 --> 01:21:11.605
That's my creed

1329
01:21:11.806 --> 01:21:13.637
My code

1330
01:21:13.842 --> 01:21:15.901
I been scorned and slandered
And ridiculed too


1331
01:21:17.512 --> 01:21:19.776
Had to suffer every day
My whole life through


1332
01:21:21.483 --> 01:21:23.781
Seen my share of the worst
That the world can give


1333
01:21:25.420 --> 01:21:28.912
But I still got a dream
And a burnin' rage to live


1334
01:21:29.324 --> 01:21:31.656
Walk hard

1335
01:21:33.395 --> 01:21:34.384
Walk hard

1336
01:21:36.331 --> 01:21:38.799
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
Welcome to the show.


1337
01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:40.228
We've got a great one.

1338
01:21:40.435 --> 01:21:43.233
To get things rolling,
I'd like to bring out my first guest...


1339
01:21:43.438 --> 01:21:47.841
...a model I think is pretty super:
Miss Cheryl Tiegs.


1340
01:21:51.713 --> 01:21:54.181
Well, hello, Cheryl.
Don't you look lovely tonight.


1341
01:21:54.382 --> 01:21:56.407
Well, thanks so much, sir.
So do you.


1342
01:21:56.618 --> 01:22:00.850
Cheryl, you know, you remind me
of a 1977 Corvette.


1343
01:22:01.056 --> 01:22:02.182
Why is that?

1344
01:22:02.390 --> 01:22:04.255
Because you're
a beautiful new model.


1345
01:22:07.962 --> 01:22:09.190
Just kidding.

1346
01:22:14.369 --> 01:22:16.667
Would you do me the honor
of joining me for a song?


1347
01:22:16.871 --> 01:22:19.499
Well, I thought you'd never ask,
Mr. Cox.


1348
01:22:22.143 --> 01:22:25.977
Baby, come as you are
With just your heart


1349
01:22:26.448 --> 01:22:29.212
And I'll take you in

1350
01:22:30.251 --> 01:22:32.276
You're rejected and hurt

1351
01:22:32.487 --> 01:22:37.652
To me you're worth
What you have within


1352
01:22:38.193 --> 01:22:41.594
You don't have to be a star, baby

1353
01:22:42.497 --> 01:22:44.965
To be in my show

1354
01:22:45.834 --> 01:22:49.099
Good night, everybody.
We'll see you next week.


1355
01:22:54.442 --> 01:22:55.932
Good show.

1356
01:22:59.681 --> 01:23:01.740
- You ready, Dewey?
- Yes, I'm ready.


1357
01:23:01.950 --> 01:23:06.944
"Who Wants to Party?"
Dewey, lead vocal, take one.


1358
01:23:10.258 --> 01:23:14.058
Hey, hey
Who wants to party?


1359
01:23:14.262 --> 01:23:18.130
Hey, hey
Who wants to party?


1360
01:23:18.333 --> 01:23:22.702
Hey, hey
Who wants to party now?


1361
01:23:24.506 --> 01:23:27.168
I don't know. I'll
see you in a minute.

1362
01:23:27.375 --> 01:23:30.367
All right. Everybody good?
Everybody good?


1363
01:23:30.578 --> 01:23:32.409
Whoa, Dewey.
Great party, great party.


1364
01:23:32.614 --> 01:23:35.913
Thanks, Patrick Duffy from Dallas.
Listen, mingle, enjoy yourself.


1365
01:23:36.117 --> 01:23:39.018
- Have sex with anybody you want.
- Well, can do.


1366
01:23:39.220 --> 01:23:40.619
- Hey!
- Dewey!


1367
01:23:40.822 --> 01:23:44.849
Oh, my God, your show is such a hit.
You beat McCloud last week.


1368
01:23:45.059 --> 01:23:48.654
Well, thank you, Morgan Fairchild,
but I never pay attention to the ratings.


1369
01:23:48.863 --> 01:23:51.525
Just kidding. We're gonna
take a shit on Donnie & Marie.


1370
01:23:51.733 --> 01:23:53.291
- Oh, you do that, honey.
- Yes.


1371
01:23:53.501 --> 01:23:57.267
Hey, you. Are you gonna
save a dance for me, Dewey?


1372
01:23:57.472 --> 01:23:59.940
Well, you bet,
Cheryl Ladd from Charlie's Angels.


1373
01:24:00.141 --> 01:24:02.075
Hey there, Little Miss Cox
-Tiegs.

1374
01:24:02.277 --> 01:24:04.245
Have you met my new wife,
Cheryl Cox-Tiegs?


1375
01:24:04.445 --> 01:24:06.436
We've met, yes.

1376
01:24:06.648 --> 01:24:08.843
Isn't that funny?
You're both named Cheryl.


1377
01:24:09.050 --> 01:24:11.280
Yeah. We're aware of that.

1378
01:24:12.554 --> 01:24:14.078
That is hilarious.

1379
01:24:14.355 --> 01:24:17.756
Hey, hey
Who wants to party?


1380
01:24:17.959 --> 01:24:20.257
I don't know what they're
talking about with this energy crisis.


1381
01:24:20.461 --> 01:24:23.726
Because I have plenty of energy,
all right? I am loaded with energy.


1382
01:24:25.800 --> 01:24:28.325
Look, I gave up politics
a long time ago.


1383
01:24:28.536 --> 01:24:31.972
You know, let somebody else march.
I wanna play Frisbee.


1384
01:24:32.507 --> 01:24:35.567
I'm on the beach.
I'm not marching on the beach.


1385
01:24:35.777 --> 01:24:38.109
Billy, don't be a hero

1386
01:24:38.313 --> 01:24:41.282
Don't be a fool with your life

1387
01:24:44.485 --> 01:24:46.453
Do me, Dewey.

1388
01:24:50.992 --> 01:24:54.086
I can't, Cheryl Ladd,
I'm married to Cheryl Tiegs.


1389
01:24:54.295 --> 01:24:57.355
Oh, I should've been your guest star
last week instead of her.


1390
01:24:57.565 --> 01:24:59.931
It could've been me.

1391
01:25:00.401 --> 01:25:02.631
"It could've been me. "

1392
01:25:02.837 --> 01:25:06.568
It could have been me
Could've been me


1393
01:25:06.774 --> 01:25:08.366
Stay in it. Stay in it.

1394
01:25:09.644 --> 01:25:16.243
It could've been me

1395
01:25:17.518 --> 01:25:19.850
Rocky ro-

1396
01:25:20.555 --> 01:25:23.319
No! You're repeating yourself!

1397
01:25:24.525 --> 01:25:27.983
Why can't I write
a fucking song anymore?


1398
01:25:28.329 --> 01:25:31.696
I love the nightlife
I got to boogie


1399
01:25:31.899 --> 01:25:34.697
On the disco 'round

1400
01:25:34.902 --> 01:25:36.130
Oh, yeah

1401
01:25:36.337 --> 01:25:39.170
I told you
I love the nightlife


1402
01:25:39.374 --> 01:25:40.636
I got to boogie

1403
01:25:40.842 --> 01:25:44.334
On the disco 'round
Oh, yeah


1404
01:25:44.545 --> 01:25:47.912
I'll tell you, I've never been
so truly satisfied.


1405
01:25:48.116 --> 01:25:51.085
Living here in this beautiful
beach house with you...


1406
01:25:51.286 --> 01:25:53.777
...my beautiful Cheryl Cox
-Tiegs.

1407
01:25:53.988 --> 01:25:57.116
The ratings are great.
These are the salad days.


1408
01:25:57.325 --> 01:26:01.921
Yeah, I've been looking for something
my whole life, and this is it.


1409
01:26:02.230 --> 01:26:05.028
I'm finally truly satisfied.

1410
01:26:10.538 --> 01:26:14.201
Goodbye, love

1411
01:26:14.976 --> 01:26:18.434
Goodbye, love

1412
01:26:18.646 --> 01:26:22.480
You are not going home.
You are sleeping in the guestroom.


1413
01:26:22.684 --> 01:26:24.379
Forever.

1414
01:26:24.585 --> 01:26:26.610
Because you're the only one
who stuck around.


1415
01:26:26.821 --> 01:26:28.812
Everyone else got sick of it
and left...


1416
01:26:29.023 --> 01:26:31.719
...but you stuck around,
which means you're my friend.


1417
01:26:37.565 --> 01:26:41.467
There's a starman waiting in the sky

1418
01:26:41.669 --> 01:26:43.398
He'd like to come and meet us

1419
01:26:43.604 --> 01:26:45.265
But he thinks he'd blow our minds

1420
01:26:45.473 --> 01:26:49.637
There's a starman waiting in the sky

1421
01:26:49.844 --> 01:26:53.336
He's told us not to blow it
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile


1422
01:26:53.548 --> 01:26:54.742
He told me

1423
01:26:54.949 --> 01:26:58.248
Let the children use it
Let the children lose it


1424
01:26:58.453 --> 01:27:00.614
Let all the children boogie

1425
01:27:00.888 --> 01:27:03.118
Goddamn it!

1426
01:27:04.258 --> 01:27:07.284
I mean, what do I have to do
to get you on my bone? Invent fire?


1427
01:27:07.495 --> 01:27:11.022
And then huge laugh and we go
to commercial. All right, take five.


1428
01:27:11.432 --> 01:27:13.093
Hey.

1429
01:27:13.668 --> 01:27:15.693
Great rehearsal, Dewey.
Very funny sketch.


1430
01:27:15.903 --> 01:27:17.996
Thank you.
Have you seen the ratings?


1431
01:27:18.206 --> 01:27:20.800
We're getting our ass kicked
by The Incredible Hulk.


1432
01:27:21.008 --> 01:27:24.000
Well, last night's episode
was a very special episode.


1433
01:27:24.212 --> 01:27:27.113
They revealed that the Incredible Hulk
has an evil twin.


1434
01:27:27.315 --> 01:27:28.976
And he's not green. He's red.

1435
01:27:29.183 --> 01:27:31.276
I know. It was amazing.
Did you see it?


1436
01:27:31.486 --> 01:27:34.478
You can't compete with that.
But we do need to do more promotion.


1437
01:27:34.689 --> 01:27:38.352
Here's what we'll do. We'll introduce
people to the new Dewey Cox.


1438
01:27:38.559 --> 01:27:42.461
I got a girl here to interview you.
She's from the local affiliate in Dallas.


1439
01:27:43.865 --> 01:27:46.663
I don't know.
I'm not so good on interviews.


1440
01:27:46.868 --> 01:27:49.132
Bubbe, it's a puff piece.
It's very puffy.


1441
01:27:49.337 --> 01:27:51.305
All you have to do
is remind the audience...


1442
01:27:51.506 --> 01:27:55.340
...you're not mainlining acid anymore.
And the show, it's a lot of fun, right?


1443
01:27:55.543 --> 01:27:56.703
- You're having fun.
- Yeah.


1444
01:27:56.911 --> 01:27:59.379
It's on every Thursday night
after the local news.


1445
01:27:59.580 --> 01:28:03.448
"It's on every Thursday night after your
local news. I'm not mainlining acid. "


1446
01:28:03.651 --> 01:28:05.778
- Anymore.
- Oh, I'm not gonna promise that.


1447
01:28:05.987 --> 01:28:09.184
- Whatever you're comfortable with.
- "I don't smoke angel dust anymore.


1448
01:28:09.390 --> 01:28:11.415
So don't be afraid. "
Something like that?


1449
01:28:11.626 --> 01:28:14.026
Why don't you tell us about
your new TV program?


1450
01:28:14.228 --> 01:28:16.992
Gail, it's a variety show.
I do a little bit of everything.


1451
01:28:17.198 --> 01:28:19.962
I do some singing, some dancing,
chatting with the guests...


1452
01:28:20.168 --> 01:28:22.261
...the skits, the monologues,
the comedy.


1453
01:28:22.470 --> 01:28:24.028
Wonderful. Comedy.

1454
01:28:24.238 --> 01:28:26.638
It really is a lot of fun.

1455
01:28:26.841 --> 01:28:30.709
We'll have more fun when we come
back from this word from our sponsors.


1456
01:28:30.912 --> 01:28:32.243
Don't go away.

1457
01:28:34.282 --> 01:28:37.979
Okay, you know what, I gotta tell you,
my heart goes out to you.


1458
01:28:38.186 --> 01:28:41.553
I know what it's like to be on
a piece-of-shit television program...


1459
01:28:41.756 --> 01:28:44.725
- ... because I'm hosting one right now.
- Excuse me?


1460
01:28:44.926 --> 01:28:48.020
Must wanna blow your fucking
brains out, I'll bet. I know I do.


1461
01:28:49.363 --> 01:28:51.354
And we're back
with Mr. Dewey Cox.


1462
01:28:51.566 --> 01:28:54.057
We're talking about the fun
he's having on his show.


1463
01:28:54.268 --> 01:28:58.500
But right now, let's talk about your
lovely wife, Darlene. How's she doing?


1464
01:28:58.906 --> 01:29:01.170
Darlene and I separated
some years ago, Gail.


1465
01:29:01.375 --> 01:29:03.707
Oh, okay. Guess I didn't
do my homework.


1466
01:29:03.911 --> 01:29:06.175
And to answer your question,
I miss her terribly.


1467
01:29:06.380 --> 01:29:07.642
Well, that's sweet.

1468
01:29:07.849 --> 01:29:11.012
Why don't we talk about your parents?
They've gotta be proud of you.


1469
01:29:11.552 --> 01:29:13.543
Well, my mom is dead.

1470
01:29:13.754 --> 01:29:18.589
And my pa and I don't
speak to each other...


1471
01:29:18.793 --> 01:29:20.920
...so we're not very close.

1472
01:29:22.330 --> 01:29:25.356
We can always cut around this
if it gets too pathetic.


1473
01:29:25.566 --> 01:29:28.694
Tell us about your kids.
I know you got a whole slew of them.


1474
01:29:29.136 --> 01:29:31.627
I'm locked in a custody battle
at this time.


1475
01:29:31.839 --> 01:29:34.740
Custody is being forced upon me,
which I don't think is right.


1476
01:29:34.942 --> 01:29:37.934
You know, if you don't want
the responsibility of children...


1477
01:29:38.145 --> 01:29:40.113
...you should be able to walk away...

1478
01:29:40.314 --> 01:29:44.546
...and apparently a couple of my
ex-wives don't feel the same. So, yeah.


1479
01:29:44.752 --> 01:29:47.220
Wherever my kids are, they're watching
The Dewey Cox Show...


1480
01:29:47.421 --> 01:29:50.254
...on Thursday nights at 8:00,
right after the local news.


1481
01:29:50.691 --> 01:29:52.921
And I just wanted to say
to everyone out there...


1482
01:29:53.127 --> 01:29:55.925
...I'm no longer mainlining acid
or smoking PCP.


1483
01:29:56.130 --> 01:29:57.620
It's official.

1484
01:29:58.733 --> 01:30:01.793
Okay. Why don't we lighten it up
just a bit here?


1485
01:30:02.003 --> 01:30:06.099
You're so busy, Dewey Cox, do you
have time to stop and smell the roses?


1486
01:30:06.440 --> 01:30:08.601
I've got no fucking sense of smell.

1487
01:30:09.110 --> 01:30:10.099
All right, I'm done.

1488
01:30:10.311 --> 01:30:14.509
- Come on, folks. Do a little research.
- That would've been nice information.


1489
01:30:15.850 --> 01:30:18.717
I'm sorry, I must be tired
from the show or something.


1490
01:30:18.920 --> 01:30:21.616
- It's okay.
- Yeah, Dewey, it's okay.


1491
01:30:21.822 --> 01:30:24.620
No, it's not okay.
I should be able to do this.


1492
01:30:24.825 --> 01:30:26.656
We're in no rush.

1493
01:30:27.295 --> 01:30:29.388
Should we get an
American Indian woman?


1494
01:30:29.597 --> 01:30:33.397
No, that won't help. I mean,
it should already be pretty exciting.


1495
01:30:33.601 --> 01:30:35.660
There's three of you.

1496
01:30:36.003 --> 01:30:37.698
- Yeah.
- Yeah.


1497
01:30:41.542 --> 01:30:42.804
Yeah.

1498
01:30:45.146 --> 01:30:46.807
- Dewey.
- Nate?


1499
01:30:47.014 --> 01:30:50.472
You were supposed to be double great.
What the fuck is this bullshit?


1500
01:30:50.685 --> 01:30:52.778
- I know.
- All I'm asking...


1501
01:30:52.987 --> 01:30:54.852
...is that you write one
masterpiece...


1502
01:30:55.056 --> 01:30:57.581
...that is the culmination
of your entire life.


1503
01:30:57.792 --> 01:30:58.781
How hard is that?

1504
01:30:59.226 --> 01:31:02.593
I'm empty, Nate. What do I do?

1505
01:31:02.797 --> 01:31:07.530
Dewey, who's the one person in your
life who's made you feel like shit?


1506
01:31:07.735 --> 01:31:10.101
- Pa.
- You need to talk to him, Dewey.


1507
01:31:10.972 --> 01:31:13.338
- I don't know.
- You need to hug him.


1508
01:31:14.008 --> 01:31:17.876
I have been putting this off
my entire life...


1509
01:31:18.613 --> 01:31:20.740
...but I think you might be right.

1510
01:31:23.117 --> 01:31:25.551
The wrong kid died

1511
01:31:27.455 --> 01:31:29.355
Hello, Pa.

1512
01:31:33.361 --> 01:31:34.692
What do you want?

1513
01:31:34.895 --> 01:31:37.329
I feel like there's some things
I need to say to you.


1514
01:31:37.598 --> 01:31:39.998
Well, go on. Talk.

1515
01:31:40.801 --> 01:31:42.860
I've realized that...

1516
01:31:43.371 --> 01:31:47.364
...I never really said I was sorry
for what happened with Nate.


1517
01:31:48.309 --> 01:31:51.210
Pa, I've spent my entire life...

1518
01:31:51.412 --> 01:31:54.745
...trying to find love with wives...

1519
01:31:54.949 --> 01:31:56.780
...and hotel clerks...

1520
01:31:56.984 --> 01:31:59.043
...and tollbooth attendants...

1521
01:31:59.253 --> 01:32:02.381
...and giraffes and monkeys
and trampolines...


1522
01:32:02.590 --> 01:32:05.650
...and men who dress like women
and men who look like you.


1523
01:32:06.727 --> 01:32:11.391
And I realized the only person
I've ever really wanted to love me...


1524
01:32:12.600 --> 01:32:14.534
...was you, Pa.

1525
01:32:17.138 --> 01:32:19.038
Dewey, I don't know what to say.

1526
01:32:19.240 --> 01:32:21.868
You don't have to say anything, Pa.

1527
01:32:22.076 --> 01:32:25.534
I just wanted to come here
and tell you that I loved you...


1528
01:32:26.213 --> 01:32:27.510
...and I always have.

1529
01:32:30.151 --> 01:32:35.384
I appreciate you finding the courage
to say that, Dewey.


1530
01:32:36.290 --> 01:32:38.758
But there's only one way
to settle this.


1531
01:32:41.095 --> 01:32:42.756
- Machetes.
- What?


1532
01:32:42.963 --> 01:32:45.693
The right kid is gonna die tonight.

1533
01:32:49.103 --> 01:32:51.003
You've been practicing!

1534
01:33:07.088 --> 01:33:08.487
No, Pa. No!

1535
01:33:08.689 --> 01:33:11.590
I been waiting for this
for a long time!


1536
01:33:11.792 --> 01:33:13.453
You have?

1537
01:33:19.800 --> 01:33:21.199
Oh, no.

1538
01:33:21.402 --> 01:33:23.632
Oh, my goodness!

1539
01:33:23.838 --> 01:33:25.465
I halved myself.

1540
01:33:25.673 --> 01:33:28.164
Pa! No, Pa!

1541
01:33:28.375 --> 01:33:32.903
Dewey, I guess I never realized
until this moment...


1542
01:33:33.114 --> 01:33:38.416
...just how easy it is to accidentally
cut someone in half.


1543
01:33:38.619 --> 01:33:39.608
It is, right?

1544
01:33:39.820 --> 01:33:42.084
I'm sorry for blaming you, Dewey.

1545
01:33:42.289 --> 01:33:45.349
Of course you didn't mean
to cut Nate in half.


1546
01:33:45.559 --> 01:33:47.686
It's all so obvious now.

1547
01:33:47.895 --> 01:33:49.089
Pa.

1548
01:33:49.296 --> 01:33:51.821
I should've been a better father
to you, Dewey.


1549
01:33:52.032 --> 01:33:55.627
I wish I spent more time
playing catch with you...


1550
01:33:55.836 --> 01:34:00.569
...and less time training my body
and mind to kill you in a machete fight.


1551
01:34:00.775 --> 01:34:04.040
You be a better father
than I was, Dewey.


1552
01:34:04.245 --> 01:34:05.507
I'll try, Pa.

1553
01:34:05.713 --> 01:34:07.340
It shouldn't be that hard.

1554
01:34:07.548 --> 01:34:08.742
In case I don't make it-

1555
01:34:08.949 --> 01:34:12.441
Pa! You're gonna make it!
It's the 1970s!


1556
01:34:12.653 --> 01:34:16.248
They got all kinds of new procedures
that can attach tops to bottoms now!


1557
01:34:16.457 --> 01:34:18.687
Hang in there! 
You're gonna be fine!

1558
01:34:18.893 --> 01:34:22.590
I reckon you're probably right.
Now, go call the doctor...


1559
01:34:22.797 --> 01:34:25.425
- ... and bring me some ice, a lot of ice.
- Some ice.


1560
01:34:25.633 --> 01:34:27.726
And a tourniquet.
Don't forget a tourniquet.


1561
01:34:27.935 --> 01:34:30.597
- All right, ice and a tourniquet?
- Ice and a tourniquet.


1562
01:34:30.805 --> 01:34:33.205
- And a tourniquet.
- Don't forget that tourniquet.


1563
01:34:33.407 --> 01:34:36.706
And you know those three words
you always wanted to hear, Dewey?


1564
01:34:36.911 --> 01:34:38.344
Well, here they are.

1565
01:34:38.646 --> 01:34:40.113
I love...

1566
01:34:43.184 --> 01:34:44.242
You love what?

1567
01:34:44.618 --> 01:34:46.677
Pa, you love what?

1568
01:34:47.021 --> 01:34:49.114
What was the third word?

1569
01:34:49.323 --> 01:34:50.756
Come on, one more word!

1570
01:34:50.958 --> 01:34:53.119
No!

1571
01:34:55.229 --> 01:34:58.357
I want all you fucking parasites
out of my house...


1572
01:34:58.566 --> 01:34:59.897
...right now!

1573
01:35:00.100 --> 01:35:02.830
I said, everybody out!

1574
01:35:03.404 --> 01:35:06.237
Well, look at you,
you arrogant cocksucker.


1575
01:35:06.440 --> 01:35:09.375
- How dare you.
- What happened to you, Dewey?


1576
01:35:09.577 --> 01:35:13.172
I don't know what's happened to me,
but I know what happened to you.


1577
01:35:13.380 --> 01:35:15.143
Patrick Duffy took a beating.

1578
01:35:17.484 --> 01:35:20.044
Stop it, Dewey, you son of a bitch.

1579
01:35:23.090 --> 01:35:26.025
Stop it! Patrick Duffy was only
saying what we were all feeling.


1580
01:35:26.227 --> 01:35:29.287
You get the hell away from me,
Cheryl Cox-Tiegs!


1581
01:35:33.133 --> 01:35:36.000
If you tear that sink off the wall,
I'm leaving you.


1582
01:35:36.203 --> 01:35:37.397
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.


1583
01:35:40.474 --> 01:35:42.908
I'm leaving you, Dewey Cox.

1584
01:35:43.377 --> 01:35:44.844
No!

1585
01:36:32.393 --> 01:36:33.621
Dad?

1586
01:36:36.597 --> 01:36:39.088
Yes, what is it, son?

1587
01:36:39.300 --> 01:36:42.098
I was just wondering
if you wanna have a catch.


1588
01:36:44.204 --> 01:36:45.364
A catch?

1589
01:36:47.541 --> 01:36:49.236
Son...

1590
01:36:49.777 --> 01:36:54.146
...there is nothing in this world
I want more...


1591
01:36:54.348 --> 01:36:57.044
...than to have a catch with you.

1592
01:36:58.385 --> 01:37:02.788
Son, forgive me,
this is going to sound strange...


1593
01:37:03.824 --> 01:37:05.758
...but what is your name again?

1594
01:37:05.960 --> 01:37:09.088
I'm Dewey Junior,
but my friends call me "Dewdrop. "


1595
01:37:09.730 --> 01:37:11.197
Well...

1596
01:37:15.235 --> 01:37:18.727
It's nice to formally meet you,
Dewdrop.


1597
01:37:19.006 --> 01:37:21.531
So this is catch.

1598
01:37:22.242 --> 01:37:25.370
This is what I been missing out
on all them years on the road, huh?


1599
01:37:26.213 --> 01:37:29.979
I like it, it's wonderful. You throw
it to me, I throw it back to you.


1600
01:37:30.184 --> 01:37:33.449
It's so simple, and yet so powerful.

1601
01:37:34.588 --> 01:37:36.647
Boy, you're really terrible
at this game.


1602
01:37:36.857 --> 01:37:39.485
Well, I mean, you never really
played with me before.


1603
01:37:39.693 --> 01:37:43.094
How am I supposed to learn?
A boy needs a dad.


1604
01:37:43.597 --> 01:37:45.360
Yes, he does.

1605
01:37:46.133 --> 01:37:49.762
Well, I reckon we got some lost time
to make up, you and me.


1606
01:37:49.970 --> 01:37:52.734
And all your brothers and sisters.
How many of you are there?


1607
01:37:52.940 --> 01:37:57.070
Twenty-two brothers and sisters. And
also 14 half-brothers and half-sisters.


1608
01:37:57.277 --> 01:37:59.142
Holy shit.

1609
01:37:59.713 --> 01:38:00.907
This may take a while.

1610
01:38:04.118 --> 01:38:05.813
That's real good.

1611
01:38:08.689 --> 01:38:10.179
So beautiful.

1612
01:38:16.130 --> 01:38:17.722
Are you sure you're one of mine?

1613
01:38:42.356 --> 01:38:44.256
Go ahead and taste some dirt.

1614
01:38:44.458 --> 01:38:46.050
That's good dirt. 
That's good dirt.

1615
01:38:46.260 --> 01:38:49.195
On the surface,
Macbeth is about revenge.


1616
01:38:49.396 --> 01:38:50.556
But what is the subtext?

1617
01:38:50.764 --> 01:38:53.892
A power struggle for the Scottish
royal family, that's what it is.


1618
01:38:54.101 --> 01:38:55.966
I just gave you it.
That one's a mulligan.


1619
01:39:02.309 --> 01:39:03.742
Yeah.

1620
01:39:17.157 --> 01:39:18.146
Hello, Dewey.

1621
01:39:19.226 --> 01:39:20.750
Darlene.

1622
01:39:20.961 --> 01:39:25.523
It's Dewina's birthday. I brought her
a present. It's a bracelet.


1623
01:39:26.767 --> 01:39:28.200
How's Glen Campbell?

1624
01:39:28.402 --> 01:39:30.131
He and I split
up a long time ago.

1625
01:39:30.938 --> 01:39:32.064
Really?

1626
01:39:32.439 --> 01:39:34.339
It's just me these days.

1627
01:39:34.541 --> 01:39:35.906
At age 50.

1628
01:39:36.810 --> 01:39:39.802
Would you care to take a walk
with me, Darlene Madison?


1629
01:39:41.949 --> 01:39:43.439
I haven't been playing much music.

1630
01:39:45.219 --> 01:39:49.588
I realize now I wasn't much of a father
when I was out on the road.


1631
01:39:49.957 --> 01:39:52.016
Now this is what makes me happy.

1632
01:39:52.226 --> 01:39:56.026
Not the music, not getting high...

1633
01:39:56.230 --> 01:39:58.061
...just my family.

1634
01:39:58.265 --> 01:39:59.698
That's all I care about.

1635
01:39:59.900 --> 01:40:02.596
And that family is missing one piece,
Darlene.


1636
01:40:03.504 --> 01:40:06.564
My God, you're as beautiful
as the day I met you.


1637
01:40:11.979 --> 01:40:14.641
You don't want this dirty old Cox.

1638
01:40:14.848 --> 01:40:16.611
Oh, I want it more than ever.

1639
01:40:20.320 --> 01:40:22.220
Did you wash your hair today?

1640
01:40:22.422 --> 01:40:25.118
I sure did. How could you tell?

1641
01:40:25.325 --> 01:40:27.691
It smells terrific.

1642
01:40:35.903 --> 01:40:37.063
I smelt it.

1643
01:40:37.804 --> 01:40:39.271
You mean...?

1644
01:40:40.607 --> 01:40:42.404
I smelt it!

1645
01:40:43.710 --> 01:40:45.234
I can smell again!

1646
01:40:47.915 --> 01:40:49.348
I smelt it!

1647
01:40:49.550 --> 01:40:51.950
- I smell you.
- Smell it.


1648
01:40:52.419 --> 01:40:54.182
Oh, you've been driving me wild.

1649
01:40:54.955 --> 01:40:57.253
I smelt it! I smelt it!

1650
01:40:57.457 --> 01:40:59.357
I smelt it, God!

1651
01:40:59.560 --> 01:41:01.994
It's a miracle!

1652
01:41:02.196 --> 01:41:04.061
I smell you, flowers.

1653
01:41:04.264 --> 01:41:05.561
I smell you, twig.

1654
01:41:07.768 --> 01:41:09.258
I smell horseshit!

1655
01:41:12.806 --> 01:41:14.706
It's horrible!

1656
01:41:14.908 --> 01:41:17.342
- But I can smell it!
- Smell that shit, baby!


1657
01:41:17.544 --> 01:41:19.239
I smelt it.

1658
01:41:25.118 --> 01:41:27.245
Anyway, that's when I learned...

1659
01:41:27.454 --> 01:41:31.151
...that Quaaludes and water-skiing
do not mix.


1660
01:41:31.358 --> 01:41:32.825
Now, you remember that.

1661
01:41:33.026 --> 01:41:35.426
How come you did all of that stuff,
Grandpa?


1662
01:41:35.629 --> 01:41:40.726
Well, Dewey Rahim, I'll tell you.
I was young and stupid then.


1663
01:41:40.934 --> 01:41:43.095
I didn't understand a lot of things.

1664
01:41:43.303 --> 01:41:46.466
Think it had to do with how
I was reared as a boy.


1665
01:41:46.907 --> 01:41:49.467
But, you know, 
I got no complaints.

1666
01:41:49.676 --> 01:41:51.837
It's been a beautiful ride.

1667
01:41:52.346 --> 01:41:53.574
A beautiful ride?

1668
01:41:56.783 --> 01:41:59.251
A beautiful ride.

1669
01:42:00.287 --> 01:42:04.189
Dewey, sweetheart,
there's someone here to see you.


1670
01:42:06.860 --> 01:42:08.293
Mr. Cox.

1671
01:42:10.130 --> 01:42:11.757
I'm sorry, have we met?

1672
01:42:12.199 --> 01:42:15.396
You worked with my father,
Kvetch L'Chaim.


1673
01:42:15.602 --> 01:42:16.967
You're Mr. L'Chaim's boy?

1674
01:42:17.170 --> 01:42:19.638
Dreidel L'Chaim, that's me.

1675
01:42:19.840 --> 01:42:22.274
Well, it's nice to see you again,
Dreidel L'Chaim.


1676
01:42:22.476 --> 01:42:23.704
The pleasure's all mine.

1677
01:42:23.910 --> 01:42:27.846
Listen, Mr. Cox,
there's something I want to show you.


1678
01:42:28.048 --> 01:42:30.141
I never rock a fella
But I rock a Cinderella


1679
01:42:30.350 --> 01:42:33.148
While she's sittin' in between
A nigga's legs like a cello


1680
01:42:33.353 --> 01:42:35.082
Must be those pair of double
-Ds

1681
01:42:35.289 --> 01:42:37.655
That got a nigga sittin'
Rock-hard in his jeans


1682
01:42:38.592 --> 01:42:40.685
Time to play
Make your mouth into a hole, yo


1683
01:42:40.894 --> 01:42:42.054
Tell me how I feel
When I'm rockin' your boat


1684
01:42:42.262 --> 01:42:44.389
- I wanna make you fuckin'
- Hard


1685
01:42:46.466 --> 01:42:48.400
I'm so wet, I gotta make you

1686
01:42:48.602 --> 01:42:52.299
Hard

1687
01:42:54.708 --> 01:42:57.404
Mr. L'Chaim, how could you
allow them to do such a thing...


1688
01:42:57.611 --> 01:42:59.010
...with my husband's music?

1689
01:42:59.212 --> 01:43:01.009
Through the roof, we're selling.

1690
01:43:01.214 --> 01:43:03.842
Lil' Nutzzak. That's the rapper.
Sweet kid.


1691
01:43:04.051 --> 01:43:07.452
Anyway, he's introduced
a whole new generation...


1692
01:43:07.654 --> 01:43:09.622
...to the magic of Dewey Cox.

1693
01:43:09.823 --> 01:43:13.315
You could even play together.
Cox and Lil' Nutzzak. What a package.


1694
01:43:14.628 --> 01:43:16.255
Anyway, as if that was not enough...

1695
01:43:16.463 --> 01:43:19.193
...they're giving Dewey the Lifetime
Achievement Award next month.


1696
01:43:21.802 --> 01:43:24.032
The Lifetime Achievement Award?

1697
01:43:24.237 --> 01:43:26.933
Baby, that's wonderful.

1698
01:43:27.140 --> 01:43:30.667
You go on TV, they give you the award,
you play a song, it's a magical thing.


1699
01:43:31.044 --> 01:43:33.137
I can't go on TV and play.

1700
01:43:33.347 --> 01:43:34.712
- What? Why not?
- Why, Grandpa?


1701
01:43:34.915 --> 01:43:39.545
Hell, I'm 71 years old. I don't even
know if I can rock no more.


1702
01:43:39.753 --> 01:43:41.550
Of course you can rock, sweetheart.

1703
01:43:41.755 --> 01:43:43.780
Of course you can rock, sweetheart.

1704
01:43:43.990 --> 01:43:46.049
Well, I don't know that I can rock.

1705
01:43:47.494 --> 01:43:48.984
And besides that...

1706
01:43:51.698 --> 01:43:53.859
...I gave that life up for a reason.

1707
01:43:55.469 --> 01:43:57.903
I'm afraid of the temptations,
Darlene.


1708
01:43:58.105 --> 01:44:01.336
You can do it, Dewey.
I know you can.


1709
01:44:02.109 --> 01:44:04.373
Just go out there
and sing your song.


1710
01:44:07.881 --> 01:44:10.042
I'm gonna need my band.

1711
01:44:20.927 --> 01:44:22.622
My hip.

1712
01:44:38.745 --> 01:44:40.303
Ladies and gentlemen...

1713
01:44:40.514 --> 01:44:44.814
...please welcome Jewel, Lyle Lovett
and Jackson Browne.


1714
01:44:45.018 --> 01:44:46.576
Walk hard

1715
01:44:48.121 --> 01:44:49.816
Hard

1716
01:44:50.357 --> 01:44:52.188
Down life's

1717
01:44:52.626 --> 01:44:54.719
- Rocky road
- Rocky road


1718
01:44:55.462 --> 01:44:56.759
Walk bold

1719
01:44:58.465 --> 01:45:00.330
Hard

1720
01:45:00.600 --> 01:45:02.727
That's my creed

1721
01:45:03.370 --> 01:45:05.600
- My code
- My code


1722
01:45:05.872 --> 01:45:09.603
I been scorned and slandered
And ridiculed too


1723
01:45:10.577 --> 01:45:14.479
Had to struggle every day
My whole life through


1724
01:45:15.148 --> 01:45:19.050
Seen my share of the worst
This world can give


1725
01:45:19.619 --> 01:45:24.989
But I still got a dream
And a burnin' rage to live


1726
01:45:25.425 --> 01:45:27.552
- Hi.
- Hey there.


1727
01:45:27.761 --> 01:45:28.750
Hello.

1728
01:45:28.962 --> 01:45:31.294
Oh, he is so cute.

1729
01:45:31.498 --> 01:45:33.659
What are you doing later, Dewey?

1730
01:45:35.302 --> 01:45:39.398
I am returning to the hotel
with my family.


1731
01:45:39.773 --> 01:45:41.707
Good night to you.

1732
01:45:43.844 --> 01:45:45.641
He fucked my grandma.

1733
01:45:45.846 --> 01:45:47.370
That's awesome.

1734
01:45:47.581 --> 01:45:48.605
Ghostface Killah.

1735
01:45:49.182 --> 01:45:51.582
Walking hard
I'm a real hard walker


1736
01:45:51.785 --> 01:45:54.310
Fast on the trigger
And a smooth talker


1737
01:45:54.521 --> 01:45:58.855
My guns pop out like a jack-in-the-box
I'll cut you in half like Dewey Cox


1738
01:45:59.059 --> 01:46:00.356
- Walk hard
- My skin stays scarred


1739
01:46:00.560 --> 01:46:02.050
You can ask God

1740
01:46:02.262 --> 01:46:04.287
Lots of ladies unsnapped they bras

1741
01:46:04.498 --> 01:46:06.966
Ask Lyle Lovett
I had sex on Mars


1742
01:46:07.167 --> 01:46:09.567
That's how we do it
When we walk hard


1743
01:46:09.769 --> 01:46:12.260
- Walk hard
- How do I walk? Hard as a stone


1744
01:46:12.472 --> 01:46:14.702
How do I walk?
Hard like a bone


1745
01:46:14.908 --> 01:46:17.274
- Walk hard
- How do I walk? Like a jackhammer tool


1746
01:46:17.477 --> 01:46:19.911
How do I walk?
Harder than Jewel


1747
01:46:20.113 --> 01:46:24.880
Tell me how we walk
Hard, hard, hard, hard


1748
01:46:25.085 --> 01:46:27.144
Oh, no. You're adorable.

1749
01:46:27.354 --> 01:46:30.255
Sam. What are y'all doing in here?

1750
01:46:30.457 --> 01:46:33.722
Dewey, get out of here.
You don't want no part of this shit.


1751
01:46:34.194 --> 01:46:35.183
What is it?

1752
01:46:35.395 --> 01:46:37.795
It's a medication
for erectile dysfunction.


1753
01:46:37.998 --> 01:46:39.488
It gives you a boner.

1754
01:46:39.699 --> 01:46:41.929
Not to be used if you have
a heart condition.


1755
01:46:42.135 --> 01:46:45.662
If boners last for more than four hours,
call more ladies.


1756
01:46:46.373 --> 01:46:48.398
Well, that does sound tempting.

1757
01:46:48.608 --> 01:46:52.408
But do you know what, Sam?
I really don't want no part of that shit.


1758
01:46:52.846 --> 01:46:55.440
Did you hear what I said?
It gives you a boner.


1759
01:46:55.649 --> 01:46:58.083
Hate to let you down, old friend...

1760
01:46:58.285 --> 01:47:00.810
...but I don't wanna succumb
to the temptations.


1761
01:47:01.021 --> 01:47:03.319
- My girl
- My girl


1762
01:47:03.523 --> 01:47:06.822
Talkin' 'bout my girl, yeah

1763
01:47:07.127 --> 01:47:08.389
My girl

1764
01:47:09.629 --> 01:47:10.857
The Temptations!

1765
01:47:11.064 --> 01:47:14.158
When it's cold outside

1766
01:47:15.068 --> 01:47:17.400
I got the month of May

1767
01:47:27.581 --> 01:47:30.141
Do I still have what it takes?

1768
01:47:30.850 --> 01:47:33.717
Am I still the
man I used to be?

1769
01:47:35.221 --> 01:47:37.849
And do I even want to be?

1770
01:47:38.191 --> 01:47:40.352
You're still Dewey Cox.

1771
01:47:40.560 --> 01:47:43.723
And you're the only man
who ever will be.


1772
01:47:44.331 --> 01:47:45.821
But is that enough?

1773
01:47:46.032 --> 01:47:47.499
It's more than enough.

1774
01:47:49.936 --> 01:47:54.566
Nate. Have I fulfilled my promise
to be double great for the both of us?


1775
01:47:54.774 --> 01:47:57.868
Are you kidding?
You've made 44 gold records.


1776
01:47:58.278 --> 01:48:00.303
You've been addicted to,
and then kicked...


1777
01:48:00.513 --> 01:48:02.208
...almost every drug known to man.

1778
01:48:02.415 --> 01:48:05.578
You slept with 411 women
and three men.


1779
01:48:05.785 --> 01:48:08.720
Dewey, you have had
an awesome life.


1780
01:48:09.089 --> 01:48:11.057
I have, haven't I?

1781
01:48:11.257 --> 01:48:13.020
You sure have.

1782
01:48:14.461 --> 01:48:17.988
- Pa.
- Son, you learned the hard way.


1783
01:48:18.198 --> 01:48:21.031
You can't spend all your time
thinking about Dewey Cox.


1784
01:48:21.234 --> 01:48:23.862
You gotta think about the world
and your family.


1785
01:48:24.070 --> 01:48:26.334
But then, at the same time...

1786
01:48:26.539 --> 01:48:28.063
Are you my inner child?

1787
01:48:28.274 --> 01:48:31.243
- Yeah, Dewey, I'm you.
- He's us.


1788
01:48:31.478 --> 01:48:34.879
You realized you gotta take care
of Dewey Cox.


1789
01:48:35.081 --> 01:48:38.175
That's a little different
than what I was saying.


1790
01:48:38.385 --> 01:48:39.613
You're all right.

1791
01:48:39.819 --> 01:48:44.847
Pa, inner child, Nate,
my own reflection.


1792
01:48:45.458 --> 01:48:48.950
I've learned that I can't spend
all my time thinking about Dewey Cox.


1793
01:48:49.162 --> 01:48:51.687
And I've also learned
I need to love Dewey Cox.


1794
01:48:51.898 --> 01:48:54.458
I can't spend all my time
thinking about other people.


1795
01:48:54.668 --> 01:48:56.363
I have to focus on myself.

1796
01:48:56.569 --> 01:49:01.404
But also not focus on myself
and instead focus on other people.


1797
01:49:01.608 --> 01:49:03.235
It's all so clear now.

1798
01:49:03.977 --> 01:49:06.639
It's not about yourself
and other people.


1799
01:49:06.846 --> 01:49:09.110
- Mama.
- It's about the music.


1800
01:49:09.315 --> 01:49:12.580
- It's about the music.
- It always has been.


1801
01:49:13.520 --> 01:49:15.112
It always has been.

1802
01:49:15.321 --> 01:49:17.482
It always has been.

1803
01:49:18.091 --> 01:49:21.356
- Who are you?
- I'm your feminine side.


1804
01:49:21.561 --> 01:49:24.086
I've been waiting for you
to get in touch with me.


1805
01:49:26.766 --> 01:49:28.563
We heard him sing
about walking hard...


1806
01:49:28.768 --> 01:49:31.999
...and we learned a little something
about how we wanted to walk.


1807
01:49:32.572 --> 01:49:36.008
What do we think about
when we think about Cox?


1808
01:49:36.209 --> 01:49:38.006
He's been called the Drifter.

1809
01:49:38.211 --> 01:49:42.580
Also the Shape Shifter,
the Master Chef, the Chameleon.


1810
01:49:42.782 --> 01:49:45.148
The Problem Child. The Hard One.

1811
01:49:45.351 --> 01:49:48.252
The White Indian. 
The Giant Midget.

1812
01:49:48.488 --> 01:49:51.753
If Elvis and Buddy Holly are
the Cain and Abel of rock 'n' roll...


1813
01:49:51.958 --> 01:49:54.119
...and Bruce Springsteen
is Zechariah...


1814
01:49:54.327 --> 01:49:56.124
...Iggy Pop is Methuselah...

1815
01:49:56.329 --> 01:49:59.958
...and, of course, Neil Young
is the wise prophet Ezekiel...


1816
01:50:00.166 --> 01:50:02.930
...then what does
that make Dewey Cox?


1817
01:50:03.136 --> 01:50:04.865
Well, I don't know what God...

1818
01:50:05.071 --> 01:50:06.265
Mr. Cox?

1819
01:50:07.073 --> 01:50:09.598
I don't wanna rush him,
but he goes on in a minute.


1820
01:50:11.111 --> 01:50:15.878
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is my great honor to introduce...


1821
01:50:16.082 --> 01:50:19.347
...for the first time on-stage
in 25 years...


1822
01:50:19.552 --> 01:50:22.612
...performing his final masterpiece...

1823
01:50:22.822 --> 01:50:25.347
...that will sum up his entire life...

1824
01:50:25.558 --> 01:50:27.116
Mr. Cox?

1825
01:50:27.427 --> 01:50:28.985
...the one, the only...

1826
01:50:29.195 --> 01:50:30.753
I'm ready.

1827
01:50:30.964 --> 01:50:32.898
...Mr. Dewey Cox.

1828
01:50:48.782 --> 01:50:50.773
Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen.


1829
01:50:51.251 --> 01:50:53.082
You'll forgive me if I'm a bit rusty.

1830
01:50:53.286 --> 01:50:56.050
This is the first song I've written
in a very long time.


1831
01:50:56.256 --> 01:50:57.314
I hope you enjoy it.

1832
01:50:59.459 --> 01:51:02.223
Now that I have lived

1833
01:51:02.862 --> 01:51:06.025
A lifetime's worth of days

1834
01:51:06.599 --> 01:51:09.090
Finally I see

1835
01:51:09.936 --> 01:51:13.667
The folly of my ways

1836
01:51:14.874 --> 01:51:17.536
So listen when I sing of

1837
01:51:17.911 --> 01:51:20.709
The temptations of this world

1838
01:51:21.447 --> 01:51:24.439
Fancy cars and needles

1839
01:51:26.219 --> 01:51:30.121
Whiskey, flesh and pearls

1840
01:51:30.490 --> 01:51:33.186
And then in the end

1841
01:51:33.726 --> 01:51:36.627
It's family and friends

1842
01:51:37.430 --> 01:51:39.557
Loving yourself

1843
01:51:39.933 --> 01:51:42.458
But not only yourself

1844
01:51:42.836 --> 01:51:46.431
It's about the good walk
And the hard walk


1845
01:51:46.639 --> 01:51:50.598
And the young girls you've made cry

1846
01:51:50.810 --> 01:51:55.372
It's about make a little music
Every day till you die


1847
01:51:56.149 --> 01:51:58.640
It's a beautiful ride

1848
01:51:58.852 --> 01:52:02.652
Beautiful ride

1849
01:52:02.856 --> 01:52:04.448
A beautiful ride

1850
01:52:04.657 --> 01:52:08.787
Beautiful ride

1851
01:52:10.830 --> 01:52:13.924
Beautiful

1852
01:52:14.133 --> 01:52:19.002
Beautiful ride

1853
01:52:19.772 --> 01:52:22.673
As I stand on the precipice of death

1854
01:52:23.076 --> 01:52:25.704
My perspective is enormous

1855
01:52:26.379 --> 01:52:28.939
Every leaf, every cloud

1856
01:52:29.349 --> 01:52:32.512
I see the hands
Which have formed us


1857
01:52:32.919 --> 01:52:35.183
And some days all you got

1858
01:52:35.922 --> 01:52:38.584
Is a nighttime graveyard walk

1859
01:52:38.992 --> 01:52:41.984
And you whistle some sweet melody

1860
01:52:42.195 --> 01:52:46.291
To the ghosts down at the dock

1861
01:52:47.300 --> 01:52:49.234
Sing into your hand

1862
01:52:50.603 --> 01:52:53.128
Lead the marching band

1863
01:52:53.773 --> 01:52:58.267
Don't you let 'em fade
Your colors gray


1864
01:52:59.913 --> 01:53:02.541
'Cause when all is said and done

1865
01:53:03.082 --> 01:53:05.607
When youth is spent and burned

1866
01:53:06.486 --> 01:53:09.216
You'll see that it's all about

1867
01:53:09.422 --> 01:53:10.548
Music

1868
01:53:10.957 --> 01:53:12.117
Flowers

1869
01:53:12.659 --> 01:53:13.648
Babies

1870
01:53:14.294 --> 01:53:15.921
Sharin' the good times

1871
01:53:16.129 --> 01:53:18.154
Travelin' not just for business

1872
01:53:18.364 --> 01:53:20.798
Accepting your mortality

1873
01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:26.233
This is finally what I've learned

1874
01:53:26.739 --> 01:53:29.640
And then in the end

1875
01:53:29.842 --> 01:53:32.777
It's family and friends

1876
01:53:33.546 --> 01:53:35.673
Loving yourself

1877
01:53:35.982 --> 01:53:38.815
But not only yourself

1878
01:53:39.385 --> 01:53:42.354
It's about the good walk
And the hard walk


1879
01:53:42.722 --> 01:53:46.818
And the young girls you've made cry

1880
01:53:47.093 --> 01:53:52.497
It's about make a little music
Every day till you die


1881
01:53:52.699 --> 01:53:54.166
It's a beautiful ride

1882
01:53:54.367 --> 01:53:59.395
Beautiful ride

1883
01:54:00.606 --> 01:54:06.340
Beautiful ride

1884
01:54:06.980 --> 01:54:09.813
Beautiful

1885
01:54:10.216 --> 01:54:13.242
Beautiful ride

1886
01:54:13.453 --> 01:54:18.049
Beautiful ride

1887
01:54:19.792 --> 01:54:25.094
Beautiful ride

1888
01:54:26.099 --> 01:54:28.863
Beautiful

1889
01:54:29.335 --> 01:54:36.434
Beautiful ride

1890
01:59:35.474 --> 01:59:36.964
Walk hard

1891
01:59:38.944 --> 01:59:40.434
Hard

1892
01:59:41.747 --> 01:59:43.271
Down life's

1893
01:59:44.450 --> 01:59:46.350
Rocky road

1894
01:59:48.020 --> 01:59:49.544
Walk bold

1895
01:59:51.357 --> 01:59:52.346
Hard

1896
01:59:53.793 --> 01:59:55.522
That's my creed

1897
01:59:57.330 --> 02:00:00.128
My code

1898
02:00:00.333 --> 02:00:01.857
Walk hard

1899
02:00:03.469 --> 02:00:04.629
Walk hard

1900
02:00:06.672 --> 02:00:08.970
Walk hard

1901
02:00:10.176 --> 02:00:17.105
Walk hard
