Lord of Lanka

755
01:10:49.010 --> 01:10:55.340
he looked have called this council just

756
01:10:52.070 --> 01:10:59.030
to consider this ridiculous threat from

757
01:10:55.340 --> 01:11:02.060
a handful of men
and monkeys just send a

758
01:10:59.030 --> 01:11:04.910
couple of my men
who not even present at

01:11:02.060 --> 01:11:10.430
this council and they will surely wipe

out Rams army Robin I told you before

761
01:11:10.430 --> 01:11:16.310
but now I have
to repeat it those who

762
01:11:14.150 --> 01:11:20.120
govern the kingdom should never be

763
01:11:16.310 --> 01:11:24.620
swayed by flattery the Army's attacking

764
01:11:20.120 --> 01:11:28.180
us are no ordinary ones Jarvan I'll tell

765
01:11:24.620 --> 01:11:31.960
you this for your own good return Sita

766
01:11:28.180 --> 01:11:35.420
she is the wife
of the Prince of Ionia

767
01:11:31.960 --> 01:11:39.170
grandfather why do we have to return her

768
01:11:35.420 --> 01:11:40.970
now if we release her now they would

769
01:11:39.170 --> 01:11:46.070
think that we are all afraid of fighting

770
01:11:40.970 --> 01:11:48.950
it is not so I
cannot bear the sight of

771
01:11:46.070 --> 01:11:54.070
so many people injured and even more

772
01:11:48.950 --> 01:11:57.440
dead just for this one woman grandfather

773
01:11:54.070 --> 01:12:00.770
that means you are afraid of fighting if

774
01:11:57.440 --> 01:12:06.440
you're scared of bloodshed how can you

775
01:12:00.770 --> 01:12:10.570
fight Indrajit I am
no coward but yes I

776
01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:12.500
don't want to fight unnecessarily you

777
01:12:10.570 --> 01:12:16.270
called me all wrong

778
01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:20.950
yes brave prince of the vomitus please

779
01:12:16.270 --> 01:12:20.950
listen to what I have to say carefully

780
01:12:21.380 --> 01:12:27.890
for these many months I've been thinking

781
01:12:24.830 --> 01:12:32.330
only of defeating Robin now my dream is

782
01:12:27.890 --> 01:12:34.490
about to come true however I have

783
01:12:32.330 --> 01:12:38.420
considered this matter over and over

784
01:12:34.490 --> 01:12:41.600
again I have concluded that I can stop

785
01:12:38.420 --> 01:12:44.900
this fight even now
if my wife Sita and

786
01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:51.600
other captives are released and they ask

787
01:12:44.900 --> 01:12:54.500
for shelter under me you are no doubt

788
01:12:51.620 --> 01:12:57.380
surprised but the shedding of blood

789
01:12:54.500 --> 01:13:00.020
should be avoided and real beasts should

790
01:12:57.380 --> 01:13:02.540
come back to the three wells to ensure

791
01:13:00.020 --> 01:13:06.710
this I am ready to forgive and forget

792
01:13:02.540 --> 01:13:09.850
the misdeeds of Robin Angad could you

793
01:13:06.710 --> 01:13:09.850

795
01:13:14.500 --> 01:13:24.500

of our enemies along with those of our

01:21:36.390 --> 01:21:41.730
own soldiers lux when they were our men

871
01:21:39.989 --> 01:21:45.180
and Robin's men while they were alive

872

a true satria to
be moved by such a

I too was full of anger and bitterness

879
01:22:01.400 --> 01:22:08.009
but on our journey
to Lanka I have come

880
01:22:04.680 --> 01:22:11.640
to see that all
of us have received the

881
01:22:08.009 --> 01:22:13.799
precious gift of life from the gods and

882
01:22:11.640 --> 01:22:17.810
it is more important
to be a good human

883
01:22:13.799 --> 01:22:21.180
being than to be just a good Kshatriya

884
01:22:17.810 --> 01:22:22.070

951
01:29:29.730 --> 01:29:34.980
of Garvin's troops from the government

952
01:29:32.130 --> 01:29:37.529
after six months sleep he would have

953
01:29:34.980 --> 01:29:39.299
become immortal but it seems to me that

954
01:29:37.529 --> 01:29:42.239
rather than forced him to wake up

955
01:29:39.299 --> 01:29:44.190
earlier because he was in terror to see

956
01:29:42.239 --> 01:29:44.880
so many of his soldiers killed one after

957
01:29:44.190 --> 01:29:47.610
the other

958
01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:48.810
oh yes he needs Kumbhakarna but even he

959
01:29:47.610 --> 01:29:51.449
is not immortal

960
01:29:48.810 --> 01:29:53.820
he's only mighty enough to make all the

Vanaras soldiers run away in panic by

962

very eyes I know
it must be one of

1061
01:39:56.710 --> 01:40:03.699
Indrajit magic tricks magic trick yes

1062
01:40:01.239 --> 01:40:06.400
and we must not allow his tricks to

1063
01:40:03.699 --> 01:40:06.909
perplex us your grief will only give him

1064

strength

1065
01:40:06.909 --> 01:40:13.090
Indrajit strength lies in his magical

1066
01:40:10.120 --> 01:40:15.429
powers the only way to take these powers

1067
01:40:13.090 --> 01:40:18.219
away from him is to attack indrajith

1068
01:40:15.429 --> 01:40:19.750
while he performs his tantric rites in

1069

the cave of nickim villa

1070
01:40:19.750 --> 01:40:24.549
Indrajit makes it a rule to perform a

1071
01:40:22.509 --> 01:40:27.100
religious ceremony he offers sacrifices

1072
01:40:24.549 --> 01:40:30.190
to the goddess nickim dealer from the

01:40:32.620 --> 01:40:40.450
through this ceremony I see no

1076
01:40:38.320 --> 01:40:42.970
