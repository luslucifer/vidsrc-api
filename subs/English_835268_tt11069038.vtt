1
00:00:46.601 --> 00:00:47.893
<i>Listen up, guys!</i>

2
00:00:49.685 --> 00:00:51.477
<i>A toast to Helena and Ivan!</i>

3
00:00:56.641 --> 00:01:00.141
It's been a tough few months
since we shut down the cooperative.


4
00:01:00.225 --> 00:01:02.477
I've had to move back to my parents'...

5
00:01:02.561 --> 00:01:03.561
what can I say?

6
00:01:04.017 --> 00:01:07.141
But let me tell you,
it's not all bad news.


7
00:01:07.517 --> 00:01:11.685
Most of us go around all day
talking about changing our lives.


8
00:01:12.141 --> 00:01:15.517
We go on and on about this
and then we do nothing.


9
00:01:16.309 --> 00:01:19.269
You've always been more
about action than words.


10
00:01:19.349 --> 00:01:20.977
Well, especially you, Helena.

11
00:01:21.061 --> 00:01:24.061
We know Ivan is a big mouth
like the rest of us!


12
00:01:25.725 --> 00:01:26.725
It's true.

13
00:01:27.185 --> 00:01:28.809
- Me too!
- Yes, yes...


14
00:01:29.393 --> 00:01:32.393
What you're about to do
is very brave


15
00:01:32.977 --> 00:01:35.933
and we're so proud of you.
Gorgeous!


16
00:01:37.477 --> 00:01:39.349
We want a house-warming party!

17
00:01:39.433 --> 00:01:41.101
- Yes, we do!
- Sure thing!


18
00:01:44.269 --> 00:01:46.849
In the meantime,
because we love you so much...


19
00:01:47.433 --> 00:01:48.433
roll the video!

20
00:03:52.101 --> 00:03:54.685
If we put the vegetable garden
facing east...


21
00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:56.101
- Yes.
- on that slope,


22
00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:00.101
the wall will keep
the seeds warm.


23
00:04:03.061 --> 00:04:05.477
And we'll open up
the window to the south.


24
00:04:06.517 --> 00:04:08.309
Right?
There's no rush for that.


25
00:04:09.477 --> 00:04:11.393
I want it finished
before I have the baby.


26
00:04:13.225 --> 00:04:15.101
And a pool
when we get some money.


27
00:04:16.477 --> 00:04:18.017
When we get a lot of money.

28
00:04:18.517 --> 00:04:19.517
We'll do it.

29
00:04:24.809 --> 00:04:25.809
Look.

30
00:04:49.225 --> 00:04:50.309
Hi, Enric!

31
00:04:53.977 --> 00:04:55.185
Gee, here already?

32
00:04:55.269 --> 00:04:56.641
- Hi, Enric.
- The architects?


33
00:04:56.725 --> 00:04:58.185
- How's it going?
- How are you?


34
00:04:58.269 --> 00:04:59.769
Good journey?
Yes.


35
00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:00.849
Hi, how are you?

36
00:05:00.893 --> 00:05:03.641
Looking at the ruins
your auntie left behind?


37
00:05:03.725 --> 00:05:06.433
Shut up! We're excited.
We'll fix it up.


38
00:05:06.517 --> 00:05:08.685
You still have time
to go back to Barcelona.


39
00:05:08.769 --> 00:05:10.561
No, the tourists can keep it.

40
00:05:11.101 --> 00:05:12.141
- Come here.
- What?


41
00:05:13.141 --> 00:05:15.309
- Look what your auntie left you.
- What?


42
00:05:15.393 --> 00:05:16.393
Poum!

43
00:05:22.517 --> 00:05:23.601
Hi, Poum!

44
00:05:24.809 --> 00:05:25.809
But...

45
00:05:26.433 --> 00:05:27.477
Is this for us?

46
00:05:27.561 --> 00:05:28.641
Hi, Poum!

47
00:05:29.433 --> 00:05:30.433
Hello!

48
00:05:34.433 --> 00:05:36.393
He's gorgeous!
Where are you taking him?


49
00:05:36.477 --> 00:05:39.017
Your auntie kept him here
in the enclosure.


50
00:05:39.933 --> 00:05:40.933
Tied up?

51
00:05:41.349 --> 00:05:43.893
She had him loose
because it's all fenced in.


52
00:05:43.977 --> 00:05:45.601
There's lots to eat.

53
00:05:46.225 --> 00:05:47.849
What do we do with him?

54
00:05:49.017 --> 00:05:50.269
Feed him

55
00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:53.061
and then think
about getting another one.


56
00:05:54.349 --> 00:05:55.349
Another donkey?

57
00:05:55.641 --> 00:05:58.561
Yes, because donkeys need company.

58
00:05:58.641 --> 00:06:02.893
Sometimes they won't even eat
if they're all by themselves.


59
00:06:02.977 --> 00:06:03.977
No...

60
00:06:04.601 --> 00:06:05.601
Poum...

61
00:06:06.141 --> 00:06:08.017
You don't like being lonely.

62
00:07:55.309 --> 00:07:57.017
What a sleepy head.

63
00:08:05.061 --> 00:08:06.061
Yes.

64
00:08:13.725 --> 00:08:14.849
How are you feeling?

65
00:08:15.561 --> 00:08:16.561
Fine.

66
00:08:18.141 --> 00:08:19.933
I'm tired.
That's normal.


67
00:08:22.769 --> 00:08:25.017
Everything okay here?

68
00:08:59.101 --> 00:09:00.933
We need to change the beams.

69
00:09:03.101 --> 00:09:05.061
To stabilise the structure.

70
00:09:06.601 --> 00:09:07.849
We can restore them.

71
00:09:09.477 --> 00:09:13.101
It would be cool
to keep the original materials, right?


72
00:09:15.977 --> 00:09:17.141
It'll be pricey.

73
00:09:18.769 --> 00:09:20.061
We can do it ourselves.

74
00:09:29.393 --> 00:09:32.393
Can FalcÃ³ has around 1200 acres.

75
00:09:33.185 --> 00:09:37.141
I've checked it out
and if you strip the cork this year,


76
00:09:37.933 --> 00:09:40.561
you could make
between 10 and 12 thousand Euros.


77
00:09:41.601 --> 00:09:44.809
- Do the wages come from that?
- No, you pay them first.


78
00:09:46.601 --> 00:09:49.561
- How much?
- They get 150 Euros per day.


79
00:09:49.641 --> 00:09:52.017
That's a lot of money, isn't it?

80
00:09:52.101 --> 00:09:55.685
No, they leave the forest
in really good shape,


81
00:09:56.393 --> 00:09:58.933
they're locals,

82
00:09:59.769 --> 00:10:01.517
and they need to eat every day.

83
00:10:19.849 --> 00:10:22.849
- Is this burnt too?
- Yes, it's burnt.


84
00:10:27.309 --> 00:10:28.641
This is useless.

85
00:10:29.809 --> 00:10:30.809
See?

86
00:10:47.517 --> 00:10:51.809
What we were saying
is that it'll be a very dry summer.


87
00:10:52.225 --> 00:10:56.101
A cigarette butt still alight
or North winds could start a fire,


88
00:10:56.185 --> 00:10:57.517
so we must be prepared.

89
00:10:57.601 --> 00:11:02.517
Excuse our ignorance,
but what does "being prepared" involve?


90
00:11:03.017 --> 00:11:04.561
First of all,

91
00:11:04.933 --> 00:11:06.685
have good hoses.

92
00:11:06.893 --> 00:11:09.517
If fire comes,
you'll need to defend the house.


93
00:11:10.017 --> 00:11:12.269
The paths and undergrowth must be clean

94
00:11:12.349 --> 00:11:14.393
and the tank must be full of water.

95
00:11:14.685 --> 00:11:16.269
That way...
What tank?


96
00:11:16.349 --> 00:11:21.225
- Yes, in 1989, the ADF...
- No, it was 1988.


97
00:11:21.561 --> 00:11:23.141
Yes, 1988 or 1989.

98
00:11:23.849 --> 00:11:27.101
The ADF installed
a water tank for each house


99
00:11:27.933 --> 00:11:31.977
so that the helicopters can get water
in the case of a fire.


100
00:11:40.849 --> 00:11:43.141
They sound
like the apocalypse is coming.


101
00:11:43.725 --> 00:11:45.977
Fires must be
their yearly entertainment.


102
00:11:50.601 --> 00:11:51.601
This is deserted.

103
00:11:55.685 --> 00:11:57.769
- Want to shoot a little?
- Yes.


104
00:12:02.477 --> 00:12:04.017
Ready to lose, or what?

105
00:12:04.349 --> 00:12:06.225
- Shut it.
- How about a head start?


106
00:12:06.309 --> 00:12:07.641
How about a beating?

107
00:12:08.685 --> 00:12:09.809
One, two...

108
00:12:15.433 --> 00:12:16.641
Mines a bit wonky.

109
00:12:17.061 --> 00:12:19.061
- You're a bit wonky.
- Shut up.


110
00:12:22.349 --> 00:12:24.225
- Afternoon.
- Afternoon, Maurici.


111
00:12:24.309 --> 00:12:26.309
- How are things? Three please.
- Yes.


112
00:12:31.101 --> 00:12:35.141
- Wow, they're pretty good.
- They're well trained.


113
00:12:35.393 --> 00:12:36.433
So I see!

114
00:12:36.849 --> 00:12:37.893
Come on, guys.

115
00:12:37.977 --> 00:12:38.977
Look...

116
00:12:40.725 --> 00:12:43.101
Look through here.
I know how it works!


117
00:12:43.185 --> 00:12:44.433
Do you live here?

118
00:12:44.517 --> 00:12:47.601
- Yes, in Can FalcÃ³. Do you know it?
- Yes, Dolors' place.


119
00:12:48.017 --> 00:12:49.225
She was my auntie.

120
00:12:49.309 --> 00:12:52.061
- I'm Maurici Benach.
- Helena, pleased to meet you.


121
00:12:52.141 --> 00:12:53.933
- The new landowner?
- Yes.


122
00:12:54.017 --> 00:12:55.269
- Hi.
- How are you?


123
00:12:57.725 --> 00:12:59.433
Very good. OK.

124
00:13:00.933 --> 00:13:03.477
Do you have someone to harvest the cork?

125
00:13:05.185 --> 00:13:06.977
It's what we do.

126
00:13:07.849 --> 00:13:10.101
We've kind of sorted something already.

127
00:13:10.185 --> 00:13:12.561
I did it for Dolors fourteen years ago,

128
00:13:12.641 --> 00:13:14.393
I know that cork well.

129
00:13:14.477 --> 00:13:18.061
I could get it done
in about six weeks


130
00:13:18.561 --> 00:13:20.517
and pay you around 20,000 Euros.

131
00:13:20.933 --> 00:13:22.185
- Twenty thousand?
- Yes.


132
00:13:22.893 --> 00:13:26.017
- Do the wages come from there?
- I take care of it all.


133
00:13:26.349 --> 00:13:27.601
That's a net price.

134
00:13:28.933 --> 00:13:31.393
We get started
and pay you when we're done.


135
00:13:32.769 --> 00:13:35.641
Ask about Maurici Benach,
we do a good job


136
00:13:36.349 --> 00:13:37.849
without any problems.

137
00:13:38.309 --> 00:13:39.769
- Great.
- Thanks.


138
00:13:40.101 --> 00:13:41.101
Thanks.

139
00:13:42.517 --> 00:13:43.561
That's not bad.

140
00:13:58.141 --> 00:13:59.893
He seems like a rural tyrant.

141
00:14:00.641 --> 00:14:02.849
Someone probably told him we were there.

142
00:14:02.933 --> 00:14:06.225
Yes, Maurici Benach has eyes everywhere.

143
00:14:06.725 --> 00:14:08.393
Were those even his kids?

144
00:14:08.893 --> 00:14:10.517
Maybe he paid them.

145
00:14:32.641 --> 00:14:34.225
Let me tell you,

146
00:14:34.309 --> 00:14:38.349
there must be a reason your Enric
didn't mention this Maurici.


147
00:14:38.433 --> 00:14:41.561
And he sure doesn't seem
shy with his words.


148
00:14:41.641 --> 00:14:44.977
- You're reading into it too much.
- But it's a bit dodgy.


149
00:14:45.477 --> 00:14:48.477
- What do we tell Enric?
- We're not married to Enric.


150
00:14:49.225 --> 00:14:52.061
We can't pay
the guys from the cooperative, can we?


151
00:14:52.561 --> 00:14:55.309
Unless we refurbish
after the harvest.


152
00:14:58.477 --> 00:15:01.977
No, you're right,
we'll do it before the baby's born.


153
00:15:04.641 --> 00:15:06.933
We'll work
with the coop guys next year...


154
00:15:08.269 --> 00:15:10.769
if they haven't all fallen out by then.

155
00:15:20.641 --> 00:15:21.641
Hi there!

156
00:16:06.641 --> 00:16:10.977
<i>Which could happen in Catalan forests
depending on the drought conditions,</i>


157
00:16:11.061 --> 00:16:13.141
<i>rises in temperature or radiation.</i>

158
00:16:13.225 --> 00:16:14.893
<i>Conditions that will determine</i>

159
00:16:14.977 --> 00:16:17.561
<i>where and how
climate change will affect us most.</i>


160
00:16:17.641 --> 00:16:21.517
<i>Especially with beeches
and deciduous oaks</i>


161
00:16:21.601 --> 00:16:25.477
<i>which respond quickly to drought
by shedding their leaves.</i>


162
00:16:25.561 --> 00:16:28.725
<i>They shed them and wait
to see if the situation improves</i>


163
00:16:28.809 --> 00:16:30.309
<i>so they can grow them back.</i>

164
00:16:30.393 --> 00:16:33.269
<i>Unlike other species
such as pines, for example,</i>


165
00:16:33.349 --> 00:16:35.641
<i>which tolerate
bad conditions much better,</i>


166
00:16:35.725 --> 00:16:37.101
<i>they're better prepared.</i>

167
00:16:37.185 --> 00:16:40.517
<i>This resource, called Vulnemap,
shows which areas...</i>


168
00:17:08.601 --> 00:17:09.685
<i>Good day, ma'am.</i>

169
00:17:16.601 --> 00:17:19.269
I've heard you live alone
in this farmhouse.


170
00:17:19.349 --> 00:17:21.477
I've come to keep you company.

171
00:17:31.269 --> 00:17:33.769
Your aunt was a good woman

172
00:17:34.225 --> 00:17:36.893
but she'd lost her marbles.

173
00:17:39.061 --> 00:17:41.893
She knew nothing about the forest.

174
00:17:46.601 --> 00:17:49.349
If you ask around,
they'll tell you


175
00:17:50.101 --> 00:17:51.433
I'm in the cork business.

176
00:17:53.269 --> 00:17:55.101
What deal are you offering?

177
00:17:57.601 --> 00:17:59.849
I've had many interesting offers.

178
00:18:05.349 --> 00:18:07.769
I'll get it all done
in a minute and a half.


179
00:18:14.561 --> 00:18:17.393
Haven't you seen me
going round on my tractor mower?


180
00:18:19.225 --> 00:18:20.685
You haven't heard the...?

181
00:18:25.685 --> 00:18:27.641
Haven't you felt the earth tremble?

182
00:18:40.101 --> 00:18:41.101
Helena?

183
00:18:43.349 --> 00:18:44.561
Is that your name?

184
00:18:53.269 --> 00:18:55.561
No! You stink!
You're all dusty.


185
00:18:55.641 --> 00:18:57.517
Come here, I'm a forest beast!

186
00:18:57.977 --> 00:18:59.849
I'm a beast!

187
00:19:00.977 --> 00:19:01.977
Stop!

188
00:19:06.893 --> 00:19:07.893
No!

189
00:19:08.893 --> 00:19:11.561
No! Why you... Damn it!

190
00:19:20.893 --> 00:19:22.017
I can't!

191
00:19:24.641 --> 00:19:28.349
Stop it! I'm pregnant!
What a nerve! Come here!


192
00:19:57.977 --> 00:19:59.641
Where are you going so early?

193
00:20:00.393 --> 00:20:01.725
I want to get there first.

194
00:20:03.393 --> 00:20:05.933
You're the boss,
you don't have to get there first.


195
00:20:06.685 --> 00:20:08.101
We have work to do today.

196
00:20:08.769 --> 00:20:11.349
We'll buy the hoses later, I promise.

197
00:20:15.101 --> 00:20:17.477
If we're going to live off this,
I should learn.


198
00:20:22.809 --> 00:20:23.809
Go back to sleep.

199
00:21:54.269 --> 00:21:56.101
- Morning.
- What are you doing here?


200
00:21:56.933 --> 00:21:57.933
Here I am...

201
00:21:58.477 --> 00:21:59.725
It's not necessary.

202
00:22:00.185 --> 00:22:01.185
I know, but...

203
00:22:01.685 --> 00:22:05.141
I thought I could help
and learn how it all works.


204
00:22:08.269 --> 00:22:09.769
It's my estate, right?

205
00:22:11.433 --> 00:22:14.141
Why don't you say say a few words?

206
00:22:14.769 --> 00:22:17.269
- What?
- A few words to start the season.


207
00:22:19.601 --> 00:22:20.601
No, thank you.

208
00:22:22.477 --> 00:22:25.849
Otherwise they'll think you're here
to control them. Go on!


209
00:22:28.977 --> 00:22:29.977
Guys.

210
00:22:30.393 --> 00:22:31.393
Come here.

211
00:22:32.269 --> 00:22:33.933
This is Ivan,

212
00:22:34.017 --> 00:22:36.061
the landowner's husband.

213
00:22:36.141 --> 00:22:38.641
He's going to say a few words
to start the harvest.


214
00:22:40.641 --> 00:22:41.641
Well...

215
00:22:42.977 --> 00:22:44.349
Good morning...

216
00:22:45.725 --> 00:22:46.725
colleagues.

217
00:22:50.017 --> 00:22:52.685
I've come here today,
the first day,


218
00:22:53.225 --> 00:22:58.061
to make it clear from the start
that I want us to work together.


219
00:22:59.561 --> 00:23:01.349
Beginnings are important

220
00:23:01.433 --> 00:23:03.561
so I want you
to know from day one

221
00:23:04.393 --> 00:23:06.561
that I want us to work together.

222
00:23:08.433 --> 00:23:11.101
You probably think
I have no idea about all this


223
00:23:11.893 --> 00:23:12.893
and you're right.

224
00:23:13.601 --> 00:23:15.101
But...

225
00:23:15.685 --> 00:23:18.017
I'll do my bit like any other worker.

226
00:23:20.933 --> 00:23:23.933
Anything you need,
you know where Helena and I are


227
00:23:24.641 --> 00:23:28.849
and if I have any questions,
I'll ask you.


228
00:23:29.641 --> 00:23:30.769
That's it.

229
00:23:33.141 --> 00:23:34.517
Let's have a good harvest.

230
00:23:35.269 --> 00:23:37.933
Sharpen your axes,
let's do this.


231
00:23:40.977 --> 00:23:42.601
Come on, guys. Let's go.

232
00:28:46.725 --> 00:28:48.269
Excuse me, who are you?

233
00:28:51.141 --> 00:28:53.725
I'm Ivan.
What's your name?


234
00:28:54.017 --> 00:28:56.225
- Karim.
- It's a pleasure.


235
00:28:56.309 --> 00:28:57.309
I'm working.

236
00:29:37.725 --> 00:29:38.725
Morning.

237
00:29:39.101 --> 00:29:40.685
Are you working at Can FalcÃ³?

238
00:29:44.933 --> 00:29:47.641
We work wherever Maurici tells us to.

239
00:29:53.561 --> 00:29:55.477
Mohamed?
Who's that?


240
00:30:07.185 --> 00:30:08.561
Check out the boss!

241
00:30:16.141 --> 00:30:17.641
- Morning.
- How are you?


242
00:30:17.725 --> 00:30:18.725
Good morning.

243
00:30:19.477 --> 00:30:20.601
Maurici?
Yes?


244
00:30:20.685 --> 00:30:22.017
- Can we talk?
- Yes.


245
00:30:25.309 --> 00:30:26.685
These men up here...

246
00:30:27.601 --> 00:30:28.601
The Moors?

247
00:30:28.849 --> 00:30:31.309
- Don't say that.
- Come on.


248
00:30:31.393 --> 00:30:33.685
- What are their conditions?
- What do you mean?


249
00:30:33.769 --> 00:30:36.185
- Are they insured?
- Ricardo.


250
00:30:36.349 --> 00:30:40.017
Tell him to chill out.
He's used to Barcelona life.


251
00:30:41.477 --> 00:30:42.477
Are they insured?

252
00:30:42.517 --> 00:30:44.017
Look, in our work...

253
00:30:44.641 --> 00:30:46.893
Some seasons you can,
others you can't...


254
00:30:46.977 --> 00:30:48.977
Their situation is really good,

255
00:30:49.061 --> 00:30:50.685
they're happy working.

256
00:30:50.769 --> 00:30:53.809
Just ask Mohamed, he's really happy.

257
00:30:53.893 --> 00:30:55.561
What if something happens?

258
00:30:55.641 --> 00:30:57.061
There won't be a problem.

259
00:30:57.141 --> 00:31:00.685
I'm responsible for everything.
We've been doing this for years.


260
00:31:01.017 --> 00:31:02.769
It's fine, don't worry.

261
00:31:20.141 --> 00:31:21.349
Want to have a go?

262
00:31:23.725 --> 00:31:25.141
Right up in the air.

263
00:32:06.309 --> 00:32:07.309
Hi!

264
00:32:08.977 --> 00:32:09.977
How are you?

265
00:32:10.017 --> 00:32:11.809
- How are you, love?
- Good.


266
00:32:12.349 --> 00:32:14.185
I've bought groceries,
ready for lunch?


267
00:32:15.017 --> 00:32:16.477
Morning, everyone!
Morning!


268
00:32:16.561 --> 00:32:19.141
How's it going, Maurici?
Are they behaving?


269
00:32:19.225 --> 00:32:21.393
They could go faster
but it's quality cork.


270
00:32:21.477 --> 00:32:23.601
They'll get faster.
How many tons today?


271
00:32:23.685 --> 00:32:26.185
This truck has one and a half.

272
00:32:26.601 --> 00:32:28.809
The numbers are looking good.
Let's go eat.


273
00:32:28.893 --> 00:32:30.893
- We're not done yet.
- They can finish.


274
00:32:30.977 --> 00:32:32.933
Maurici, can I take Ivan for lunch?

275
00:32:33.017 --> 00:32:35.101
I've told him
he doesn't need to be here.


276
00:32:35.185 --> 00:32:37.977
If I leave with you
they won't have any respect for me.


277
00:32:38.061 --> 00:32:38.893
You go.

278
00:32:38.977 --> 00:32:41.477
What do you mean?

279
00:32:41.933 --> 00:32:44.017
- Go on.
- Come for lunch, please.


280
00:32:44.101 --> 00:32:46.061
Go home, I'll be there soon.

281
00:32:52.561 --> 00:32:53.933
Have you stripped a tree?

282
00:32:54.809 --> 00:32:55.809
My love...

283
00:32:57.101 --> 00:32:59.769
It takes years to learn.
We could try.


284
00:32:59.849 --> 00:33:01.477
- Another day.
- Morning, boss.


285
00:33:02.893 --> 00:33:04.141
- Hi!
- Want me to show you?


286
00:33:04.225 --> 00:33:05.641
- Of course!
- Come up here.


287
00:33:07.517 --> 00:33:08.517
Morning!

288
00:33:10.769 --> 00:33:13.017
- Which one, boss?
- Whichever you say.


289
00:33:13.101 --> 00:33:14.101
This one, then.

290
00:33:15.933 --> 00:33:17.269
See this stripe?

291
00:33:18.685 --> 00:33:19.809
Here?

292
00:33:19.893 --> 00:33:21.809
Take the axe with two hands.
Okay.


293
00:33:21.893 --> 00:33:24.225
Strike it head on and twist the head.

294
00:33:24.893 --> 00:33:26.101
- Like this?
- Yes.


295
00:33:26.185 --> 00:33:27.185
Hard.

296
00:33:28.017 --> 00:33:29.017
Here I go.

297
00:33:30.849 --> 00:33:31.849
Good!

298
00:33:32.017 --> 00:33:34.269
- Now what?
- Twist it left and right.


299
00:33:34.601 --> 00:33:36.061
Left and right.

300
00:33:36.349 --> 00:33:38.349
- Left like this?
- That's right.


301
00:33:39.849 --> 00:33:42.725
Helena, you shouldn't be doing that.

302
00:33:44.933 --> 00:33:46.393
- Again.
- A bit lower.


303
00:33:46.477 --> 00:33:47.769
One, two...

304
00:33:48.977 --> 00:33:49.977
No!

305
00:33:50.309 --> 00:33:51.309
One, two...

306
00:33:52.225 --> 00:33:53.685
Three!
There you go!


307
00:33:56.349 --> 00:33:57.349
Did you hear?

308
00:33:57.893 --> 00:33:59.561
A little lower.

309
00:34:01.185 --> 00:34:03.809
What are you doing?
You shouldn't be doing that.


310
00:34:03.893 --> 00:34:05.933
Stop being annoying.
I'm almost done.


311
00:34:22.393 --> 00:34:23.641
He's pissed off.

312
00:34:33.769 --> 00:34:34.769
Look!

313
00:34:37.061 --> 00:34:38.185
You're not buying it.

314
00:34:39.685 --> 00:34:40.893
Let's go have lunch.

315
00:34:42.933 --> 00:34:44.061
Let's go have lunch.

316
00:34:44.769 --> 00:34:46.933
I'll come when I'm done.
Move.


317
00:34:47.769 --> 00:34:48.769
Out of the way.

318
00:37:55.433 --> 00:37:56.601
- I'm going in.
- Yes.


319
00:37:58.393 --> 00:37:59.977
Bloody hell!

320
00:38:03.477 --> 00:38:05.477
What you've done here is incredible.

321
00:38:06.561 --> 00:38:07.725
I'm really happy.

322
00:38:10.517 --> 00:38:13.517
I thought we could widen that opening

323
00:38:13.601 --> 00:38:15.101
to frame the views.

324
00:38:16.225 --> 00:38:19.393
Then two more on the ceiling
to bring in more light.


325
00:38:19.601 --> 00:38:20.601
Great.

326
00:38:23.477 --> 00:38:24.725
And a long bench here?

327
00:38:25.893 --> 00:38:27.433
For reading or napping.

328
00:38:30.101 --> 00:38:31.101
Or downstairs?

329
00:38:32.061 --> 00:38:35.061
But up here too...
It doesn't matter.


330
00:38:36.309 --> 00:38:37.849
Let me show you.

331
00:39:00.393 --> 00:39:01.933
It's a bit posh, isn't it?

332
00:39:03.601 --> 00:39:04.849
They're references.

333
00:39:09.725 --> 00:39:11.477
I love some of these details

334
00:39:11.561 --> 00:39:14.061
like the contrast between materials.

335
00:39:14.141 --> 00:39:15.309
The local materials.

336
00:39:15.849 --> 00:39:18.101
The balance of the spaces...

337
00:39:18.769 --> 00:39:21.309
The way it blends in
with the surroundings.


338
00:39:21.393 --> 00:39:24.893
It clashes with it,
they're little palaces.


339
00:39:25.769 --> 00:39:28.517
I imagined something simpler,
more integrated.


340
00:39:30.933 --> 00:39:33.225
Lots of people
will see the refurbishment.


341
00:39:34.477 --> 00:39:37.185
If we do it right,
we could get a lot of work.


342
00:39:37.269 --> 00:39:39.061
But what kind of work?

343
00:39:39.725 --> 00:39:40.725
And for whom?

344
00:39:41.349 --> 00:39:42.517
That's the thing.

345
00:39:50.393 --> 00:39:53.225
Well then, show me your references.

346
00:39:53.725 --> 00:39:55.641
That way, we can discuss it.

347
00:40:19.017 --> 00:40:20.309
How's the harvest going?

348
00:40:22.185 --> 00:40:23.185
The harvest? Fine.

349
00:40:24.685 --> 00:40:27.725
But I think Maurici
has Moroccans working illegally.


350
00:40:28.977 --> 00:40:30.309
It wouldn't surprise me.

351
00:40:42.769 --> 00:40:43.769
Helena?

352
00:40:45.809 --> 00:40:46.933
What should we do?

353
00:40:49.185 --> 00:40:50.685
It's not our problem.

354
00:40:50.769 --> 00:40:53.061
Yes, it is.
They're working here.


355
00:40:54.017 --> 00:40:56.017
- What do you want to do?
- Something.


356
00:40:57.685 --> 00:41:01.017
If we report it, we'll get no money
and they'll have no work.


357
00:41:01.477 --> 00:41:03.685
We can't accept it, Helena...

358
00:41:03.769 --> 00:41:05.893
Have you asked them what they want?

359
00:41:15.061 --> 00:41:17.893
We need to sort out
the water tank tomorrow.


360
00:41:18.641 --> 00:41:20.641
- I can't tomorrow.
- Why?


361
00:41:21.685 --> 00:41:24.349
- I have to go to the forest.
- You're so stubborn.


362
00:41:24.433 --> 00:41:26.269
- You don't have to.
- I want to.


363
00:41:26.349 --> 00:41:27.349
Why?

364
00:41:28.185 --> 00:41:29.225
Because I like it.

365
00:41:32.349 --> 00:41:34.933
And I want to learn
to do it my own way

366
00:41:35.017 --> 00:41:37.849
without Maurici or dodgy deals,
working in a collective,


367
00:41:37.933 --> 00:41:39.393
the way it should be.

368
00:41:44.477 --> 00:41:46.433
- Damn it.
- I'll go, I'll go.


369
00:41:48.725 --> 00:41:50.393
There's some good stuff there.

370
00:41:50.769 --> 00:41:52.685
Thanks for doing all this, really.

371
00:41:54.725 --> 00:41:57.809
A drug dealer from Figueres
will buy the house for sure.


372
00:43:05.225 --> 00:43:06.349
Let's go eat.

373
00:43:20.477 --> 00:43:22.309
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.


374
00:43:27.849 --> 00:43:28.849
Thanks.

375
00:43:32.561 --> 00:43:33.477
Careful.

376
00:43:33.561 --> 00:43:35.017
It's really hot.
Yeah.


377
00:43:38.225 --> 00:43:39.309
What's up, Hassan?

378
00:43:40.433 --> 00:43:41.641
Nice day today.

379
00:43:41.725 --> 00:43:42.725
It's really hot.

380
00:43:45.849 --> 00:43:47.101
I'm thirsty.

381
00:43:52.809 --> 00:43:54.349
Have you been here long?

382
00:43:54.433 --> 00:43:56.141
It's my third season.

383
00:43:57.141 --> 00:44:00.185
Hassan and Yassin
have been with me since the beginning.


384
00:44:00.269 --> 00:44:01.269
And Karim?

385
00:44:01.561 --> 00:44:03.769
It's his first season with us.

386
00:44:07.393 --> 00:44:09.225
Where did you harvest before?

387
00:44:11.061 --> 00:44:12.061
Morocco.

388
00:44:13.561 --> 00:44:15.561
Andalusia, Extremadura...

389
00:44:16.477 --> 00:44:17.601
many years.

390
00:44:17.685 --> 00:44:20.101
- Do they treat you well here?
- Yes.


391
00:44:22.561 --> 00:44:25.561
- Where do you live?
- In a house in the village.


392
00:44:27.641 --> 00:44:28.685
It's hardly a house.

393
00:44:28.769 --> 00:44:29.769
It's a wreck.

394
00:44:29.893 --> 00:44:31.017
Are you happy there?

395
00:44:31.101 --> 00:44:32.601
It's just for one season.

396
00:44:32.685 --> 00:44:34.141
We have to put up with it.

397
00:44:34.225 --> 00:44:35.225
Yes.

398
00:44:38.061 --> 00:44:40.061
It's just one season.

399
00:44:42.349 --> 00:44:44.101
If you need anything,

400
00:44:44.769 --> 00:44:47.685
if you have any problems,
you can talk to me. Okay?


401
00:44:48.477 --> 00:44:49.477
Thank you.

402
00:44:54.309 --> 00:44:56.225
It's only a few days

403
00:44:56.309 --> 00:44:59.561
and you won't stop
complaining about the house.


404
00:46:08.977 --> 00:46:10.809
Are you coming?
It's 4:30 p.m.


405
00:46:15.309 --> 00:46:16.309
Be right there.

406
00:48:08.225 --> 00:48:09.225
So?

407
00:48:12.641 --> 00:48:13.977
What's this car, Helena?

408
00:48:14.977 --> 00:48:16.477
I changed our car for this.

409
00:48:17.809 --> 00:48:20.269
Isn't it cool?
What? Where's our car?


410
00:48:20.517 --> 00:48:22.893
Our car used to hit all the bumps,

411
00:48:22.977 --> 00:48:25.225
we could hardly leave the house.
But...


412
00:48:25.309 --> 00:48:27.933
why are you using the past tense?
Where's our car?


413
00:48:28.017 --> 00:48:29.309
Have you lost it?

414
00:48:29.933 --> 00:48:32.349
Have you?
Listen, this is what we need.


415
00:48:32.433 --> 00:48:34.809
We can go everywhere with this.
Look at it!


416
00:48:35.101 --> 00:48:36.433
Help with those, please.

417
00:48:37.433 --> 00:48:39.225
Will you help?
Unbelievable.


418
00:48:41.517 --> 00:48:42.849
Don't be mad.

419
00:48:43.185 --> 00:48:45.141
It's like the one the harvesters have.

420
00:49:14.769 --> 00:49:15.809
God dammit.

421
00:49:16.141 --> 00:49:17.141
Fucking Chema!

422
00:49:19.349 --> 00:49:20.769
Something wrong, Maurici?

423
00:49:24.017 --> 00:49:27.225
Whatever Chema was celebrating
last night is still going on.


424
00:49:27.849 --> 00:49:28.977
He hasn't come.

425
00:49:31.477 --> 00:49:32.561
Come on, guys.

426
00:49:32.641 --> 00:49:33.933
Let's go!

427
00:50:27.977 --> 00:50:30.061
- Morning, boss.
- Morning, Chema.


428
00:50:31.849 --> 00:50:33.061
Spoken to Maurici?

429
00:50:34.141 --> 00:50:36.433
Me and Maurici have an understanding.

430
00:50:38.685 --> 00:50:41.601
What a fucking disaster,
these guys are cheap, but...


431
00:50:42.393 --> 00:50:44.061
these necks are shit.

432
00:50:45.185 --> 00:50:47.225
- What?
- These necks...


433
00:50:48.433 --> 00:50:49.433
This is no good.

434
00:50:50.269 --> 00:50:53.017
You have to take this off.

435
00:51:02.349 --> 00:51:04.601
Watch out for dry soil,

436
00:51:04.685 --> 00:51:07.393
if there isn't any,
come back down. Okay?


437
00:51:07.477 --> 00:51:09.809
- We'll go up and make our way down.
- Yes.


438
00:51:11.849 --> 00:51:12.893
Ready, boss?

439
00:51:16.393 --> 00:51:18.225
No, you go on. Thanks.

440
00:51:18.309 --> 00:51:20.101
I'll walk, I fancy a walk.

441
00:53:47.769 --> 00:53:48.893
<i>Let the match begin.</i>

442
00:54:04.017 --> 00:54:06.601
<i>Wait, wait.</i>

443
00:54:19.769 --> 00:54:20.977
Come on, let's go.

444
00:54:21.061 --> 00:54:22.061
Come get it.

445
00:54:22.393 --> 00:54:23.393
Come get it.

446
00:54:23.477 --> 00:54:24.477
Here, here.

447
00:54:24.849 --> 00:54:25.849
Come here.

448
00:55:03.269 --> 00:55:06.561
You can't do something like that
without talking to me, you know?


449
00:55:09.101 --> 00:55:11.769
Did you talk to me
when you swapped our car?


450
00:55:13.477 --> 00:55:15.101
Yes, you're right.

451
00:55:15.185 --> 00:55:16.769
It's exactly the same.

452
00:55:16.849 --> 00:55:19.101
No, you're right, it's very different.

453
00:55:19.185 --> 00:55:21.601
You should have seen
the conditions he was in.


454
00:55:21.685 --> 00:55:23.477
It's not our problem, Ivan.

455
00:55:23.849 --> 00:55:24.725
No.

456
00:55:24.809 --> 00:55:27.101
Tell Maurici to handle it.

457
00:55:27.185 --> 00:55:29.977
Maurici will send him back
and it'll happen again.


458
00:55:30.061 --> 00:55:32.225
His colleagues ignore him.
He just got here.


459
00:55:32.309 --> 00:55:34.477
He's only 18, Helena.

460
00:55:34.809 --> 00:55:36.725
Be a bit more caring.

461
00:55:39.849 --> 00:55:41.517
You won't make me feel guilty.

462
00:55:43.517 --> 00:55:47.561
If you need to do things like this
to feel good about yourself, great,


463
00:55:47.893 --> 00:55:48.893
go ahead.

464
00:55:49.769 --> 00:55:52.185
But don't bring strangers
onto my property.


465
00:55:56.061 --> 00:55:57.349
"My property"?

466
00:56:03.269 --> 00:56:04.809
Did you talk like that before?

467
00:56:05.517 --> 00:56:06.893
- Before? When?
- Before.


468
00:56:07.061 --> 00:56:08.561
- Before? When?
- Before we came here.


469
00:56:08.641 --> 00:56:11.309
We weren't having a baby before.

470
00:56:11.725 --> 00:56:13.393
Our priorities have to change.

471
00:56:15.269 --> 00:56:16.601
Or am I alone in this?

472
00:56:17.517 --> 00:56:18.517
Fucking hell.

473
00:56:19.185 --> 00:56:22.685
I want to live according to my ideas

474
00:56:22.769 --> 00:56:25.893
and pass them on to my child,
that's a priority for me.


475
00:56:28.977 --> 00:56:31.225
I hope they don't get your stubbornness.

476
00:56:34.561 --> 00:56:37.225
At least they'll be passionate
about something.


477
00:56:38.893 --> 00:56:42.225
It's easy to be a die-hard idealist
when others take care of things


478
00:56:42.309 --> 00:56:43.517
you don't want to do.

479
00:56:46.017 --> 00:56:49.185
Or when someone else works
while your account is empty.


480
00:56:51.769 --> 00:56:54.977
Or do you want to
live in a squat house?

481
00:57:04.101 --> 00:57:05.933
What the fuck are we doing?

482
00:57:06.725 --> 00:57:07.601
No.

483
00:57:07.685 --> 00:57:09.893
He's in the stables like an animal.

484
00:57:09.977 --> 00:57:12.349
If he comes up,
he'll have dinner with us every night.


485
00:57:13.685 --> 00:57:14.933
Can you hear yourself?

486
00:57:31.061 --> 00:57:32.061
Come on.

487
00:57:32.517 --> 00:57:33.517
Sit down here.

488
00:57:40.269 --> 00:57:41.269
Hello.

489
00:57:54.101 --> 00:57:55.393
Thanks.
You're welcome.


490
00:57:57.433 --> 00:57:58.769
Do you speak French?

491
00:58:00.309 --> 00:58:01.309
A little.

492
00:58:02.185 --> 00:58:03.685
Almost everyone in Morocco.

493
00:58:03.769 --> 00:58:04.769
Of course.

494
00:58:10.433 --> 00:58:11.309
Thanks.

495
00:58:11.393 --> 00:58:12.725
He doesn't speak French.

496
00:58:14.601 --> 00:58:15.601
I know.

497
00:58:15.809 --> 00:58:17.561
So you understand each other.

498
00:58:19.141 --> 00:58:20.141
Enjoy your meal.

499
00:58:21.725 --> 00:58:22.725
Thanks.

500
00:58:33.641 --> 00:58:36.433
Muslims don't drink alcohol, do they?

501
00:58:43.725 --> 00:58:44.725
Oh, enough.

502
00:58:52.185 --> 00:58:53.185
Sorry.

503
00:58:54.101 --> 00:58:55.893
He thinks he's seen the world.

504
00:58:55.977 --> 00:58:57.725
That he's super cool, you know?

505
00:58:59.061 --> 00:59:02.601
But he has a really closed mentality.

506
00:59:04.061 --> 00:59:05.349
Has he travelled a lot?

507
00:59:05.641 --> 00:59:07.433
Yes, he's travelled all right

508
00:59:08.269 --> 00:59:10.517
but his ideas don't change.

509
00:59:12.101 --> 00:59:14.725
He never sees what's in front of him.

510
00:59:15.893 --> 00:59:16.893
Like a mole.

511
00:59:17.101 --> 00:59:18.101
What?

512
00:59:18.685 --> 00:59:20.225
You know, like a mole.

513
00:59:21.101 --> 00:59:23.433
Digs the earth
and travels through tunnels


514
00:59:24.393 --> 00:59:25.517
but sees nothing.

515
00:59:26.725 --> 00:59:27.725
A mole.

516
00:59:40.893 --> 00:59:41.977
What did he say?

517
00:59:43.893 --> 00:59:45.561
I can't translate it!

518
01:00:27.769 --> 01:00:29.561
The bitch's fanny was like that,

519
01:00:29.641 --> 01:00:31.517
the dog was drooling behind her...

520
01:00:31.601 --> 01:00:34.433
Four and a half hours... for nothing.

521
01:00:39.977 --> 01:00:41.849
- Morning.
- Morning.


522
01:00:43.849 --> 01:00:45.225
Hi, how are things?

523
01:00:47.933 --> 01:00:50.101
Did you take
the little Moor to live with you?


524
01:00:50.561 --> 01:00:51.561
Yes, why?

525
01:00:52.141 --> 01:00:53.141
<i>Me first.</i>

526
01:00:53.517 --> 01:00:55.685
Hey. Who gave you permission?

527
01:00:56.061 --> 01:00:58.893
What's up with him?
Karim, what's gotten into you?


528
01:00:59.101 --> 01:01:00.685
They sent him to fuck around.

529
01:01:00.769 --> 01:01:02.601
I said, get out.

530
01:01:02.685 --> 01:01:05.101
What's wrong with you, dipshit?
Have you no shame?


531
01:01:05.185 --> 01:01:06.893
Get out, dipshit.

532
01:01:17.685 --> 01:01:18.685
Hey, boss.

533
01:01:19.685 --> 01:01:20.685
How are you?

534
01:01:21.477 --> 01:01:22.561
What are you doing?

535
01:01:23.349 --> 01:01:24.517
Resting a little.

536
01:01:24.977 --> 01:01:25.977
My back hurts.

537
01:01:27.309 --> 01:01:28.561
My back... bad.

538
01:01:29.185 --> 01:01:31.433
There's a lot of work to do.
Come on, Karim.


539
01:01:35.101 --> 01:01:36.433
Get to work. Go on.

540
01:01:58.185 --> 01:02:00.849
Hey, you know that doesn't go like that.

541
01:03:32.893 --> 01:03:33.893
Delicious.

542
01:03:39.101 --> 01:03:40.101
Want some?

543
01:03:40.269 --> 01:03:41.517
Yes. Thanks.

544
01:03:42.601 --> 01:03:43.601
Here.

545
01:03:48.141 --> 01:03:49.141
See this, boss?

546
01:03:50.725 --> 01:03:53.561
I have wine, you have walnuts.
This is the life!


547
01:04:03.769 --> 01:04:04.769
Thanks, it's good.

548
01:04:06.641 --> 01:04:07.809
What are those tattoos?

549
01:04:08.393 --> 01:04:09.641
I did it in the Legion,

550
01:04:10.061 --> 01:04:11.269
the Green March,

551
01:04:11.349 --> 01:04:12.849
it was 45 degrees

552
01:04:13.309 --> 01:04:14.561
and with two needles.

553
01:04:14.641 --> 01:04:17.477
They guy who did it
was wasted on panther's milk.


554
01:04:18.269 --> 01:04:19.141
What's that?

555
01:04:19.225 --> 01:04:22.017
Condensed milk with gin,
half and half.


556
01:04:22.101 --> 01:04:23.101
And the tattoo?

557
01:04:23.185 --> 01:04:25.893
- The Bridegroom of Death.
- Of course, the Legion...


558
01:04:26.517 --> 01:04:28.809
But that's not you any more, right?
No.


559
01:04:29.393 --> 01:04:31.017
- Hey, Maurici.
- Morning.


560
01:04:31.101 --> 01:04:33.517
- Want some wine? Walnuts?
- No, thank you.


561
01:04:35.017 --> 01:04:36.017
Something wrong?

562
01:04:36.933 --> 01:04:38.769
Yes, I'm fed up with the workers.

563
01:04:38.849 --> 01:04:43.101
They need to go faster,
but it's not happening.


564
01:04:43.185 --> 01:04:46.269
The North wind has turned
and the cork will dry out.


565
01:04:46.977 --> 01:04:49.601
If they dry out,
we won't get the kilos we said.


566
01:04:51.641 --> 01:04:54.141
With the wind,
the cork doesn't come off the tree.


567
01:05:28.933 --> 01:05:29.933
Morning!

568
01:05:30.393 --> 01:05:31.393
Morning!

569
01:05:32.349 --> 01:05:33.349
And Ivan?

570
01:05:34.185 --> 01:05:36.893
He stayed behind to talk to Maurici.

571
01:05:59.017 --> 01:06:00.017
Let me help.

572
01:06:05.225 --> 01:06:06.309
Let me help you.

573
01:06:11.061 --> 01:06:12.061
Thank you.

574
01:06:47.685 --> 01:06:48.685
Hi.

575
01:06:48.809 --> 01:06:49.809
Hi.

576
01:06:50.977 --> 01:06:51.977
How are you feeling?

577
01:06:53.725 --> 01:06:55.393
I have a headache, but I'm fine.

578
01:06:57.809 --> 01:06:59.517
How about this North wind?

579
01:07:00.477 --> 01:07:02.517
Yes, it's crazy up there.

580
01:07:05.269 --> 01:07:06.269
Hi, Karim.

581
01:07:07.349 --> 01:07:10.477
- We must fix the tank tomorrow.
- I can't tomorrow.


582
01:07:11.349 --> 01:07:14.809
We have to work faster
or we won't do the tons we estimated.


583
01:07:16.225 --> 01:07:18.185
- Are you that behind?
- No.


584
01:07:19.477 --> 01:07:22.393
The wind makes it harder,
so we have to work faster.


585
01:07:23.185 --> 01:07:24.185
Fine.

586
01:07:24.393 --> 01:07:26.725
If there's a fire
we'll have tons of ashes.


587
01:07:26.849 --> 01:07:29.769
Enough of that, Helena.
It'll be fine.


588
01:07:33.309 --> 01:07:34.561
What if he comes with me?

589
01:07:36.685 --> 01:07:38.477
He's here to work in the forest.

590
01:07:38.893 --> 01:07:39.977
Nothing else.

591
01:07:40.685 --> 01:07:42.893
- Do you want to come?
- I can't, Helena.


592
01:07:42.977 --> 01:07:45.269
Fine, you go to the forest,
he'll help me.


593
01:07:47.017 --> 01:07:49.393
I'll pay him myself.
I'll call Maurici now.


594
01:07:50.349 --> 01:07:51.393
Whatever you say.

595
01:09:45.849 --> 01:09:46.849
Try them on.

596
01:10:06.809 --> 01:10:08.061
I think they fit fine.

597
01:10:09.641 --> 01:10:11.393
Let's see.
Walk a bit.


598
01:10:21.849 --> 01:10:22.933
Take that end.

599
01:10:23.017 --> 01:10:24.017
Okay.

600
01:10:28.561 --> 01:10:29.561
What's that?

601
01:10:29.601 --> 01:10:30.601
What?

602
01:10:30.641 --> 01:10:32.225
The yellow plastic?
Yes.


603
01:10:32.309 --> 01:10:33.309
You'll see.

604
01:10:46.769 --> 01:10:47.769
Okay?

605
01:10:48.141 --> 01:10:49.141
Yes, fine.

606
01:10:49.393 --> 01:10:50.561
Hold this here.

607
01:10:50.641 --> 01:10:52.477
The first one on your left.

608
01:10:52.849 --> 01:10:53.849
Okay.

609
01:11:12.269 --> 01:11:14.141
That's it, slowly, slowly.

610
01:11:28.309 --> 01:11:29.309
Hang on.

611
01:11:47.101 --> 01:11:48.101
Is it working?

612
01:11:48.641 --> 01:11:49.641
No.

613
01:11:57.433 --> 01:11:59.685
One, two, three!

614
01:12:16.141 --> 01:12:17.141
Super!

615
01:12:44.933 --> 01:12:46.393
What are you listening to?

616
01:12:47.933 --> 01:12:49.977
EIGrande Toto.
Moroccan hip hop.


617
01:13:13.061 --> 01:13:14.061
It's cool.

618
01:13:22.641 --> 01:13:24.309
Shit, no internet.

619
01:13:25.017 --> 01:13:26.977
What was it?
EIGrande Toto?


620
01:13:27.061 --> 01:13:28.061
Yes.

621
01:15:35.977 --> 01:15:37.561
Did you leave the gate open?

622
01:15:38.477 --> 01:15:39.477
Shit.

623
01:15:41.225 --> 01:15:42.225
Poum!

624
01:16:50.977 --> 01:16:51.977
It's okay.

625
01:16:58.017 --> 01:16:59.017
It's okay.

626
01:17:39.849 --> 01:17:42.101
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Ivan.


627
01:17:42.185 --> 01:17:44.269
Helena, you're not...

628
01:17:44.349 --> 01:17:45.477
What are you doing?

629
01:17:46.269 --> 01:17:47.893
You shouldn't be doing that!

630
01:18:15.769 --> 01:18:16.769
I'm so sorry.

631
01:18:30.225 --> 01:18:31.225
I love you.

632
01:20:31.101 --> 01:20:33.349
Ricardo! Stop!

633
01:20:33.977 --> 01:20:35.561
Stop! Hey!

634
01:20:36.017 --> 01:20:37.809
Stop! What are you doing?

635
01:20:37.893 --> 01:20:39.809
You'll get it stuck.
Are you crazy?


636
01:20:39.977 --> 01:20:41.977
Who told you to come this way?
Mohamed!


637
01:20:42.061 --> 01:20:43.561
- Mohamed!
- What?


638
01:20:43.849 --> 01:20:45.977
Why did you tell
him to come this way?

639
01:20:46.061 --> 01:20:47.433
- Who told you?
- You did!


640
01:20:47.517 --> 01:20:50.061
I said nothing.
He's making it up.


641
01:20:50.725 --> 01:20:52.769
What the fuck did I say?

642
01:20:52.849 --> 01:20:54.309
I didn't say a thing.

643
01:20:54.393 --> 01:20:55.977
Now you get it out of there.

644
01:20:56.061 --> 01:20:58.393
I've had it.
First the North wind,


645
01:20:58.477 --> 01:20:59.849
the cork not coming off

646
01:20:59.933 --> 01:21:02.769
and now the tankette stuck here...
What's going on?


647
01:21:03.141 --> 01:21:06.601
You have to do three tons per day
or the numbers won't add up.


648
01:21:08.393 --> 01:21:11.101
Yes, we'll have to cut your wages.
How much less?


649
01:21:11.185 --> 01:21:13.101
Without three tons?
A quarter less.


650
01:21:13.185 --> 01:21:14.269
Fuck that.

651
01:21:14.349 --> 01:21:16.017
Three tons with this lot?

652
01:21:18.017 --> 01:21:19.685
What the fuck are you on about?

653
01:21:19.769 --> 01:21:22.769
I'm explaining
that the chief won't pay us full time.


654
01:21:26.977 --> 01:21:28.517
Come on!

655
01:21:28.601 --> 01:21:30.601
Get the tools to dig the tankette out!

656
01:21:30.685 --> 01:21:31.685
Let's go!

657
01:21:31.769 --> 01:21:33.309
Here! If not, it won't move.

658
01:21:33.393 --> 01:21:34.393
Come on, Quim!

659
01:21:34.561 --> 01:21:35.561
Get going!

660
01:21:37.061 --> 01:21:38.517
Tie it to the front!

661
01:21:41.561 --> 01:21:43.477
- Come on.
- Let's go!


662
01:21:43.893 --> 01:21:46.101
- Give me the cable.
- Tie it here!


663
01:21:48.185 --> 01:21:49.601
Get out!

664
01:21:52.601 --> 01:21:53.601
Gently does it.

665
01:21:57.477 --> 01:21:59.017
The path's over there!

666
01:21:59.393 --> 01:22:01.185
One moment, please.

667
01:22:01.269 --> 01:22:02.601
Go on! Go.

668
01:22:11.017 --> 01:22:12.061
- Okay.
- Okay.


669
01:22:12.141 --> 01:22:13.141
That's it.

670
01:22:13.517 --> 01:22:14.685
Go wider!
Get out!


671
01:22:14.769 --> 01:22:15.769
Do it again.

672
01:22:16.477 --> 01:22:17.725
I'll remove the cable.

673
01:22:21.725 --> 01:22:22.725
That's enough!

674
01:22:25.269 --> 01:22:26.725
Hey! That's enough!

675
01:22:27.017 --> 01:22:28.101
Come on!

676
01:22:28.185 --> 01:22:30.309
Get stripping the trees!

677
01:22:30.393 --> 01:22:33.393
You're sleeping on the job,
get to work.


678
01:22:34.061 --> 01:22:35.685
Hey! Mohamed!

679
01:22:36.477 --> 01:22:39.185
In hard times,
you just sit down and die?


680
01:22:39.977 --> 01:22:41.517
Get to it, for fuck's sake.

681
01:22:42.561 --> 01:22:43.601
Get to work.

682
01:22:44.809 --> 01:22:48.225
You're the ones who need to work.
That's what I'm here for.


683
01:22:49.101 --> 01:22:51.601
Do you think I'm here
for the fun of it?

684
01:22:51.685 --> 01:22:53.769
I'm here so that you all work.
Chema!


685
01:22:54.309 --> 01:22:57.601
Haven't you seen these people?
All day pissing around.


686
01:22:57.685 --> 01:22:59.849
Let's get to work. Come on.

687
01:22:59.933 --> 01:23:00.933
Come on, Chema.

688
01:24:16.933 --> 01:24:18.141
Easy, Chema.

689
01:24:18.225 --> 01:24:20.561
You'll kill it,
it's too big for you.


690
01:24:20.933 --> 01:24:21.933
No way.

691
01:24:22.393 --> 01:24:24.017
It's strong, it won't die.

692
01:24:35.393 --> 01:24:37.477
Leave that. Come here.

693
01:24:39.641 --> 01:24:42.017
Come and help me.
I can't reach the crown.


694
01:24:43.309 --> 01:24:44.309
Are you deaf?

695
01:24:45.101 --> 01:24:47.309
Help me, man.
I can't reach the crown.


696
01:24:47.393 --> 01:24:48.433
What are you saying?

697
01:24:48.517 --> 01:24:51.061
Stop pissing around,
let's get to work.


698
01:24:51.141 --> 01:24:52.933
You're really asking for it.

699
01:24:53.433 --> 01:24:54.433
Come on!

700
01:24:56.269 --> 01:24:57.685
Who do you think you are?

701
01:24:59.349 --> 01:25:00.809
Get down like this.

702
01:25:01.725 --> 01:25:02.725
One hand here

703
01:25:03.393 --> 01:25:04.393
and another here.

704
01:25:04.977 --> 01:25:05.977
Be careful.

705
01:25:06.225 --> 01:25:07.269
Don't let me fall.

706
01:25:12.809 --> 01:25:13.809
Go on!

707
01:25:16.309 --> 01:25:17.893
Go on, will you!

708
01:25:18.225 --> 01:25:19.809
You've got it coming to you.

709
01:25:21.601 --> 01:25:22.809
There. <i>Molto bene!</i>

710
01:25:37.185 --> 01:25:39.225
How about now, Ambrosio?

711
01:25:39.769 --> 01:25:41.269
Anyone can do it like that.

712
01:25:47.433 --> 01:25:48.893
Keep still!

713
01:25:52.141 --> 01:25:53.141
Careful, lad.

714
01:25:55.393 --> 01:25:56.393
Keep still.

715
01:25:56.561 --> 01:25:57.977
You'll make me fall.

716
01:25:58.977 --> 01:26:00.061
Steady, lad.

717
01:26:00.849 --> 01:26:01.849
Keep still!

718
01:26:08.061 --> 01:26:09.061
Chema!

719
01:26:11.601 --> 01:26:13.641
Get off me, you fucking Moor!

720
01:26:13.725 --> 01:26:14.725
Chema!

721
01:26:14.809 --> 01:26:16.225
- What happened?
- Get off!


722
01:26:16.809 --> 01:26:17.809
What happened?

723
01:26:18.641 --> 01:26:19.641
What happened?

724
01:26:20.269 --> 01:26:22.309
Look for his fingers!
Look for them!


725
01:26:22.849 --> 01:26:23.933
Manel, the tape!

726
01:26:24.017 --> 01:26:25.641
- Find them!
- Look for them!


727
01:26:32.141 --> 01:26:33.393
Find the fingers.

728
01:26:33.477 --> 01:26:35.269
Ricardo! The car!

729
01:26:36.769 --> 01:26:37.809
It's here!

730
01:26:39.141 --> 01:26:40.141
Wait, wait.

731
01:26:40.225 --> 01:26:41.477
Here's the other one!

732
01:26:43.393 --> 01:26:44.433
Come on!

733
01:26:45.641 --> 01:26:46.933
Come on!

734
01:26:47.601 --> 01:26:48.477
Come here.

735
01:26:48.561 --> 01:26:50.061
There you go, Chema!

736
01:26:50.309 --> 01:26:51.725
That's it.

737
01:26:51.809 --> 01:26:52.849
Come on.

738
01:26:54.809 --> 01:26:56.477
Hang on in there, Chema.

739
01:26:57.101 --> 01:26:58.017
Hang on.

740
01:26:58.101 --> 01:26:59.101
Let's go.

741
01:26:59.809 --> 01:27:00.893
Get in the car!

742
01:27:05.477 --> 01:27:06.849
You did it on purpose!

743
01:27:06.933 --> 01:27:08.601
I didn't do anything!

744
01:27:08.685 --> 01:27:09.685
Fuck!

745
01:27:10.477 --> 01:27:12.561
Quim, for fuck's sake!
Come here.


746
01:27:12.641 --> 01:27:14.393
Stay there.
He did it on purpose!


747
01:27:14.477 --> 01:27:15.641
He did, I saw him!

748
01:27:15.725 --> 01:27:17.349
It was a fucking accident.

749
01:27:17.433 --> 01:27:19.061
Could have been any of us.

750
01:27:19.641 --> 01:27:22.477
- He dropped him.
- The doctors will look after Chema.


751
01:27:22.561 --> 01:27:23.809
Listen to me.

752
01:27:23.893 --> 01:27:27.561
All that we can do now is work.

753
01:27:27.893 --> 01:27:30.101
- Your answer to everything.
- Come on, work.


754
01:27:30.185 --> 01:27:31.685
- Work, work...
- Guys!


755
01:27:31.769 --> 01:27:32.977
Back to work.
Fuck you.


756
01:27:33.061 --> 01:27:35.725
- It was an accident, back to work.
- Fuck you.


757
01:27:36.185 --> 01:27:37.685
Ricardo, back to work. Please.

758
01:27:38.809 --> 01:27:39.977
What did you do, boy?

759
01:27:40.061 --> 01:27:44.433
You just bring problems to us.
I didn't do it on purpose.


760
01:27:44.561 --> 01:27:45.725
Didn't you hear me?

761
01:27:45.809 --> 01:27:50.061
I swear I didn't do it on purpose.

762
01:27:50.141 --> 01:27:51.893
What are you saying?
What is it?


763
01:27:53.601 --> 01:27:54.477
What?

764
01:27:54.561 --> 01:27:57.141
It was an accident.
He didn't mean to hurt him.


765
01:27:58.769 --> 01:28:00.561
Stop it, Karim.
Go home.


766
01:28:00.641 --> 01:28:02.309
You too! Leave me alone!

767
01:28:02.517 --> 01:28:04.977
Go home, for fuck's sake!

768
01:28:06.101 --> 01:28:07.101
Fuck you!

769
01:28:08.393 --> 01:28:09.977
You're nothing but problems.

770
01:29:28.101 --> 01:29:29.101
Ivan?

771
01:29:41.601 --> 01:29:42.601
Ivan?

772
01:29:47.769 --> 01:29:49.185
What are you doing here?

773
01:29:49.601 --> 01:29:50.809
You can't be here!

774
01:29:50.893 --> 01:29:53.141
Get out! Right now!
Sorry, sorry, sorry...


775
01:29:53.225 --> 01:29:55.061
- What are you doing here?
- Sorry...


776
01:29:55.141 --> 01:29:56.561
What happened?

777
01:29:56.641 --> 01:29:58.933
Where's Ivan?
Sorry, sorry, sorry...


778
01:29:59.017 --> 01:30:00.017
What's wrong?

779
01:30:00.517 --> 01:30:01.517
What? What?

780
01:30:04.309 --> 01:30:05.309
What's wrong?

781
01:30:08.225 --> 01:30:09.225
Answer me.

782
01:30:10.101 --> 01:30:11.101
Calm down.

783
01:30:27.725 --> 01:30:28.725
Help me.

784
01:30:29.433 --> 01:30:30.517
- Calm down.
- Please.


785
01:30:31.101 --> 01:30:32.101
Help me.

786
01:30:32.601 --> 01:30:33.601
Help me.

787
01:30:36.309 --> 01:30:37.393
Breathe.

788
01:30:37.477 --> 01:30:38.477
Slowly.

789
01:30:52.061 --> 01:30:54.017
- How is he?
- He's stable.


790
01:30:54.309 --> 01:30:56.561
They gave him something for the pain.

791
01:30:57.309 --> 01:30:59.977
But they can't save his fingers.
Really?


792
01:31:00.309 --> 01:31:01.309
Really.

793
01:31:03.561 --> 01:31:05.101
Chief, how's Chema?

794
01:31:06.517 --> 01:31:08.393
- He's stable.
- What does that mean?


795
01:31:08.849 --> 01:31:10.017
It means...

796
01:31:11.141 --> 01:31:13.893
He'll lose his fingers,
the tissue was dead.


797
01:31:14.393 --> 01:31:15.477
Son of a bitch.

798
01:31:15.561 --> 01:31:17.393
We'll help him as much as we can.

799
01:31:17.477 --> 01:31:19.433
But he won't work the forest again.

800
01:31:20.309 --> 01:31:22.517
What will his family do?

801
01:31:22.601 --> 01:31:24.933
- I'll help them as much as I can.
- How?


802
01:31:33.309 --> 01:31:34.309
Fucking hell.

803
01:31:45.769 --> 01:31:48.393
- Where's the little Moor?
- I sent him home.


804
01:31:48.477 --> 01:31:50.101
Get him out immediately.

805
01:31:50.849 --> 01:31:52.477
- And then what?
- I don't know.


806
01:31:52.561 --> 01:31:54.933
Put him on a bus,
a train, whatever...


807
01:31:55.561 --> 01:31:56.977
or things will get messy.

808
01:32:24.561 --> 01:32:25.561
Hey...

809
01:32:28.685 --> 01:32:29.685
It'll be okay.

810
01:32:32.017 --> 01:32:33.517
Don't worry.
We'll help you.


811
01:32:34.561 --> 01:32:35.561
Thank you.

812
01:32:46.641 --> 01:32:48.849
I have to take him. Karim.

813
01:32:48.933 --> 01:32:50.141
Come on.
Where?


814
01:32:50.225 --> 01:32:52.225
The bus station.
Come on, please.


815
01:32:52.309 --> 01:32:55.141
Come on!
Wait, Ivan. We have to help him.


816
01:32:55.225 --> 01:32:56.685
More than we already have?

817
01:32:57.141 --> 01:33:00.185
Do you know what a mess he's made?
It was an accident.


818
01:33:00.269 --> 01:33:01.685
Is that what he told you?

819
01:33:02.725 --> 01:33:04.685
Why the fuck are you smoking?
Ivan.


820
01:33:04.769 --> 01:33:06.977
Ivan. Calm down, please.

821
01:33:07.849 --> 01:33:08.849
Helena,

822
01:33:09.393 --> 01:33:12.101
we're in a lot of trouble,
you have no idea.


823
01:33:12.185 --> 01:33:14.933
He needs to go right now
before things get worse.


824
01:33:15.017 --> 01:33:16.725
Not without my money.

825
01:33:16.809 --> 01:33:19.725
- What did he say?
- He won't go until we give him


826
01:33:19.809 --> 01:33:20.977
what he's owed.

827
01:33:21.061 --> 01:33:24.933
What right does he
think he has to demand anything?


828
01:33:25.017 --> 01:33:26.725
Come on, you have to go!

829
01:33:26.809 --> 01:33:28.517
Come on, shit!
I'm not going!


830
01:33:28.601 --> 01:33:30.601
Ivan, what's wrong with you?

831
01:33:30.685 --> 01:33:32.393
We need to pay him.

832
01:33:32.977 --> 01:33:34.561
And who'll pay Chema?

833
01:33:34.641 --> 01:33:36.849
The sooner we pay him,
the sooner he'll go.


834
01:33:36.933 --> 01:33:39.933
He can go ask Maurici.
I don't recommend it.


835
01:33:40.017 --> 01:33:41.393
We'll pay him then.

836
01:33:41.477 --> 01:33:42.561
No fucking way.

837
01:33:43.309 --> 01:33:46.141
Get out! I've had it with him!
What the fuck, Ivan?


838
01:33:47.977 --> 01:33:49.849
You don't treat people like that.

839
01:33:50.561 --> 01:33:52.893
Go to the bank and we'll pay him.

840
01:33:59.893 --> 01:34:00.893
Yes, boss.

841
01:34:38.517 --> 01:34:40.809
<i>The land left behind is bleak.</i>

842
01:34:40.893 --> 01:34:45.433
<i>The junction dividing the region
in the east and west has burned down.</i>


843
01:34:45.517 --> 01:34:49.433
<i>Sometimes, we can see how close
it came to houses and farmhouses.</i>


844
01:34:49.977 --> 01:34:52.141
<i>On the AP7 motorway,
from the air,</i>


845
01:34:52.225 --> 01:34:56.477
<i>we can see hard-to-reach areas
still burning uncontrollably.</i>


846
01:34:56.561 --> 01:34:58.977
<i>From the air,
visibility is very difficult</i>


847
01:34:59.061 --> 01:35:02.685
<i>because the wind can blow the smoke
over 100 kilometres.</i>


848
01:35:02.769 --> 01:35:04.849
<i>As we get close to the fire, however,</i>

849
01:35:04.933 --> 01:35:07.061
<i>we can see that it's far from easy</i>

850
01:35:07.141 --> 01:35:10.225
<i>as it has split into many sources,
many columns of fire,</i>


851
01:35:10.309 --> 01:35:13.933
<i>and the smoke stretches
for over 60 kilometres.</i>


852
01:35:58.309 --> 01:35:59.309
He's here.

853
01:35:59.641 --> 01:36:00.725
I'll be right back.

854
01:36:11.641 --> 01:36:14.601
What's going on? What do you want?
You know what we want


855
01:36:15.477 --> 01:36:17.977
and it's nothing to do with you.
Where is he?


856
01:36:20.309 --> 01:36:21.809
- Get out, please.
- No.


857
01:36:22.101 --> 01:36:23.101
No.

858
01:36:25.141 --> 01:36:26.141
Karim!

859
01:36:26.185 --> 01:36:27.809
No! Leave him alone!

860
01:36:28.225 --> 01:36:30.185
Hey! Leave him! Karim!

861
01:36:53.601 --> 01:36:54.601
Helena!

862
01:37:00.101 --> 01:37:01.309
Helena, are you okay?

863
01:37:01.393 --> 01:37:03.225
- They went after him.
- Give me that.


864
01:37:03.309 --> 01:37:04.393
- I'm coming.
- No.


865
01:37:05.561 --> 01:37:06.561
Helena.

866
01:37:07.849 --> 01:37:08.849
Stay here.

867
01:38:14.725 --> 01:38:16.141
I think he gets the idea.

868
01:38:20.477 --> 01:38:21.477
Boss.

869
01:38:22.393 --> 01:38:24.225
This isn't your place.

870
01:38:29.977 --> 01:38:31.309
This is my estate.

871
01:38:32.141 --> 01:38:34.641
Leave him, or you'll see
who's out of place.


872
01:38:37.017 --> 01:38:38.561
Get on home.

873
01:38:46.849 --> 01:38:47.849
Come on, Quimet.

874
01:38:49.561 --> 01:38:50.561
Hear me, Quimet?

875
01:42:13.433 --> 01:42:14.433
That way.

876
01:43:42.433 --> 01:43:43.849
Mind your head.

877
01:43:44.393 --> 01:43:45.601
I'm going for it.

878
01:43:51.769 --> 01:43:54.141
Ivan, Ivan, Ivan!

879
01:44:04.561 --> 01:44:05.601
Go on then!

880
01:44:06.393 --> 01:44:08.061
- Are you going?
- Again!


881
01:44:08.141 --> 01:44:09.141
My turn.

882
01:44:22.641 --> 01:44:23.725
Throw Helena in.

883
01:44:26.809 --> 01:44:28.061
Helena, Helena!

884
01:45:12.433 --> 01:45:14.561
- What a house, Helena!
- Thanks.


885
01:45:15.117 --> 01:45:16.117
Amazing rooms.

886
01:45:59.561 --> 01:46:00.561
Hey!

887
01:46:02.933 --> 01:46:04.561
Do you want to talk?

888
01:46:10.933 --> 01:46:11.933
Let's dance!

889
01:46:22.809 --> 01:46:23.809
Laura!

890
01:46:24.269 --> 01:46:26.433
Laura! Change this shitty music!

891
01:46:31.017 --> 01:46:32.017
Laura?

892
01:46:39.561 --> 01:46:41.349
I love you!

893
01:46:46.285 --> 01:46:48.285
- What's this shit?
- Come on, BÃ rbara!


894
01:46:55.849 --> 01:46:57.101
Ivan, Ivan!

895
01:46:57.185 --> 01:46:58.185
Leave it on!

896
01:46:58.433 --> 01:47:00.517
- But what is it?
- Fucking leave it on!


897
01:47:00.601 --> 01:47:03.433
- Nobody wants to listen to this.
- I do. Leave it on!


898
01:50:16.269 --> 01:50:17.269
What's wrong?

899
01:50:17.725 --> 01:50:18.725
Fire!

900
01:50:19.310 --> 01:50:19.660
What?

901
01:50:20.141 --> 01:50:21.141
Fire!

902
01:50:31.933 --> 01:50:32.933
Quickly!

903
01:51:55.641 --> 01:51:56.685
What do we do now?

904
01:52:07.561 --> 01:52:08.641
Defend the house.
