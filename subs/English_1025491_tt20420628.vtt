on the nipple of a cigar. <i>Ja.</i>

Sexuality is the font
of all happiness, my friend.

There's much more
to happiness than that.

[LAUGHS] But despite

our repressions today.

991
00:54:06.290 --> 00:54:08.658
We've gone from sex being
the subject never spoken of


992
00:54:08.793 --> 00:54:11.095
to our not being able to talk
of anything else.


993
00:54:11.228 --> 00:54:13.197
It's as if we invented it.

994
00:54:13.331 --> 00:54:15.665
Well, perhaps we did. <i>Ja.</i>

995
00:54:17.802 --> 00:54:20.137
Yes, psychoanalysis
is inherently sexual.


996
00:54:20.271 --> 00:54:23.941
Oh, yes, we infantilize it,
turning it into the lie


997
00:54:24.075 --> 00:54:27.378
that sex under any circumstances
is perfectly normal and healthy.


998
00:54:27.510 --> 00:54:28.578
There is a sexual code

999
00:54:28.712 --> 00:54:30.680
running through the Old
and New Testaments:


1000
00:54:30.815 --> 00:54:32.615
sex is to be shared
between two people


1001
00:54:32.750 --> 00:54:34.651
who are committed to each other.

1002

It's ridiculous.

1016
00:55:11.989 --> 00:55:14.358
Not only naive,
but I think it's a mindless,

sadistic cruelty, really.

1018

1024
00:55:29.106 --> 00:55:31.809

that needing to depend on men


1025

would cause women
to give up sex completely,

homosexuality isn't immoral.
