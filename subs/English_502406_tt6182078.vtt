00:04:00.742 --> 00:04:02.226
- I was given this address.

20
00:04:20.417 --> 00:04:23.247
- Always nice to have
a new face around here.


21
00:04:23.282 --> 00:04:24.628
My name is Paula.

22
00:04:24.663 --> 00:04:25.491
- Mary.

23
00:04:26.665 --> 00:04:28.080
- All who come to this convent

24
00:04:28.114 --> 00:04:31.152
must leave behind their
former life and possessions.


25
00:04:31.186 --> 00:04:32.947
If this is a problem,
the door is there


26
00:04:32.981 --> 00:04:35.639
for you to return
that which you fled.


27
00:04:35.674 --> 00:04:36.536
- No.

28
00:04:37.676 --> 00:04:39.505
- If and when you
decide to leave us,


29
00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:41.611
your possessions will
be returned to you.


30
00:04:43.095 --> 00:04:45.131
We operate under a
strict vow of silence.


31
00:04:49.239 --> 00:04:50.965
This keeps us free
from distraction


32
00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:54.554
and closer to the Lord.
[light humming]


33
00:04:55.866 --> 00:04:58.938
We have prayer at five
am, breakfast at seven,


34
00:04:58.973 --> 00:05:00.699

You can expect to start out--

36
00:05:02.148 --> 00:05:04.288
- [Mary] Hi, what
are you reading?


37
00:05:04.323 --> 00:05:06.152
- [Paula] You don't
need to do that.


38
00:05:06.187 --> 00:05:07.844
You'll find it doesn't matter

39
00:05:07.878 --> 00:05:09.362
if anyone in here likes you.

40
00:05:09.397 --> 00:05:11.502
- [Narrator] Look at her
when she's talking to you.


41
00:05:11.537 --> 00:05:12.365
- Where is she?

42
00:05:21.305 --> 00:05:24.964
- Mother's approval is all you
should concern yourself with.


43
00:05:24.999 --> 00:05:27.173
- Thank you, Paula.

44
00:05:27.208 --> 00:05:28.658
I think Sarah has chores.

45
00:05:28.692 --> 00:05:30.970
Why don't you see to it
that she gets to them.


46
00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:42.292
Sarah, a sweet but
simple young woman


47
00:05:42.326 --> 00:05:45.709
who is repaying her
debt to us by staying on


48
00:05:45.744 --> 00:05:48.678
and helping wherever she can.

49
00:05:48.712 --> 00:05:51.301
I think she just likes to look

50
00:05:51.335 --> 00:05:52.992
at the pictures of the saints.

51
00:05:54.338 --> 00:05:56.409
I don't think she
actually reads the texts.


52
00:05:57.963 --> 00:05:59.205
- [Mary] My name is Mary.

53
00:06:02.933 --> 00:06:03.762
- Mary.

54
00:06:06.488 --> 00:06:07.558
Well of course it is.

55
00:06:08.939 --> 00:06:12.287
While we do spend most
of our days in prayer


56
00:06:12.322 --> 00:06:15.463
or divine labor,
we also make time


57
00:06:15.497 --> 00:06:16.982
for leisure activities.

58
00:06:17.016 --> 00:06:19.881
Such as reading the Holy
texts in this library.


59
00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:25.991
It may take a day or two for
you to adjust to our routine.


60
00:06:26.025 --> 00:06:28.027
But if you do decide to stay,

61
00:06:28.062 --> 00:06:31.444
our schedule will soon
become your schedule.

I'm overly cautious

and the locks on the doors


64
00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:37.243
it's because I am.

65
00:06:37.278 --> 00:06:39.038
We had a break-in recently.

66
00:06:39.073 --> 00:06:41.420
I don't need to tell you
how evil the world is.

Doris is seven months along now.

69
00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:53.812
What do you pray for child?

70
00:06:55.986 --> 00:06:57.954
- [Doris] For an end
to this pain mother.


71
00:06:59.921 --> 00:07:01.129
- Oh Doris.

72
00:07:05.755 --> 00:07:08.309
When will you realize
that your pain only


73
00:07:08.343 --> 00:07:11.208
brings you closer to him?

74
00:07:11.243 --> 00:07:13.797
Do you think that
he selfishly prayed


75
00:07:13.832 --> 00:07:16.041
for an end to his own suffering?

76
00:07:16.075 --> 00:07:17.076
Of course not.

77
00:07:19.423 --> 00:07:21.909
He prayed to end the
suffering of others.


78
00:07:24.704 --> 00:07:25.533
Now,

79
00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:28.329

[ominous music]

As you can see,
we're going through


82
00:07:49.488 --> 00:07:51.628
a bit of a transition.

83
00:07:51.662 --> 00:07:53.837
The church in Rome, while
they certainly agree


84
00:07:53.872 --> 00:07:56.460
with taking in people like you,

85
00:07:56.495 --> 00:07:58.738
do not agree with my methods.

86
00:07:58.773 --> 00:08:01.707
Which are strict, but very fair.

87
00:08:02.881 --> 00:08:05.021
So they pulled their
portrait of the pope


88
00:08:06.125 --> 00:08:07.747
and cut the Vatican
purse strings.


89
00:08:09.094 --> 00:08:11.406
Maintaining our lifestyle
on private donations


90
00:08:11.441 --> 00:08:13.374
has been challenging
to say the least.


91

Which is why you
find our sanctuary

could use a good rest.

talking in the dorms.

- Give it to me god damn it!

167
00:11:42.859 --> 00:11:43.687
- Fine.

168
00:11:44.964 --> 00:11:45.793
Here.

169
00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:56.424
- And now you get the fuck out.

170
00:12:09.161 --> 00:12:10.266
- You were late.

171
00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:12.544
- Well you wasn't was you?

172
00:12:12.578 --> 00:12:13.476
- Whole god damn
thing was started


173
00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:15.133
by the time I even got here.

174
00:12:15.167 --> 00:12:16.893
- Okay, where are we now?

175
00:12:19.723 --> 00:12:20.793
- Nearly there.

176
00:12:20.828 --> 00:12:22.001
Okay, look at me.

177
00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:26.178
God damn.

178
00:12:26.213 --> 00:12:28.836
I don't know why you don't
just let me kill your pa.


179
00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:30.251
- [Mary] Don't talk like that.

180
00:12:30.286 --> 00:12:31.701
- Well Mary Lou I'm
sorry, but just anybody's


181
00:12:31.735 --> 00:12:33.944
gonna hit his own daughter
like that is just...


182
00:12:35.325 --> 00:12:37.810
- Well, I'd rather it
be me than William.


183
00:12:38.846 --> 00:12:40.813
I talked to him by the way.

184
00:12:40.848 --> 00:12:43.022
I got him prepped for
when the time comes.


185
00:12:43.057 --> 00:12:43.851
- Yeah?

186
00:12:43.885 --> 00:12:44.679
- Yeah.

187
00:12:44.714 --> 00:12:45.956
- Does he understand?

188
00:12:45.991 --> 00:12:46.888
- Enough to know that
him and his big sister


189
00:12:46.923 --> 00:12:49.098
are going on a secret vacation.

190
00:12:49.132 --> 00:12:50.306
- Secret vacation.

191
00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:51.997
Away from your big
ass old father.


192
00:12:54.551 --> 00:12:57.209
[faint sobbing]

193
00:13:02.525 --> 00:13:04.078
- [Mother] Oh
Veronica, I've told you


194
00:13:04.113 --> 00:13:07.012
on more than one occasion,
actions have consequences.


195
00:13:07.046 --> 00:13:09.842
[heavy breathing]

196
00:13:13.743 --> 00:13:15.745
Get her out of my sight.

197
00:13:17.471 --> 00:13:19.438
- [Narrator] Do not
make another sound!


198
00:13:34.936 --> 00:13:37.594
[ominous music]

199
00:13:55.543 --> 00:14:00.548
[suspenseful music]
[growling laughter]


200
00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:10.938
[loud creaking]

201
00:14:20.982 --> 00:14:23.778
- Do you know you are neither
unique or special here?


202
00:14:29.922 --> 00:14:31.683
You should enjoy
it while it lasts.


203
00:14:32.787 --> 00:14:33.823
- What?

204
00:14:33.857 --> 00:14:34.858
- Her interest.

205
00:14:36.135 --> 00:14:38.207
She wants to see
you in her chambers.


206
00:14:38.241 --> 00:14:39.518
Make yourself presentable.

207
00:14:46.939 --> 00:14:48.009
None of your concern.

208
00:14:53.118 --> 00:14:55.948
- I'm just saying that I don't
think it should be your...


209
00:14:58.537 --> 00:15:00.298
Mary, you remember
Father Andrew.


210
00:15:00.332 --> 00:15:02.472
- It's a true pleasure
to see you again Mary.


211
00:15:05.441 --> 00:15:07.339
- [Mary] The
hallway, there was--


212
00:15:07.374 --> 00:15:08.237
- Blood?

213
00:15:09.168 --> 00:15:10.411
Yes.

214
00:15:10.446 --> 00:15:12.896
A rather nasty accident.

215
00:15:12.931 --> 00:15:15.209
Clumsy people make
clumsy mistakes.


216
00:15:16.245 --> 00:15:17.315
We'll clean it up.

217
00:15:17.349 --> 00:15:18.833
- [Mary] But the girl--

218
00:15:18.868 --> 00:15:21.560
- My policies are strict, but
they are there for a reason.


219
00:15:23.010 --> 00:15:25.392
And I know what it's like
to be in your situation.


220
00:15:27.532 --> 00:15:28.533
- You were pregnant?

221
00:15:30.638 --> 00:15:32.019
And your child, where--

222
00:15:32.053 --> 00:15:32.985
- He's a senator.

223
00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:37.058
Doesn't even know I exist.

224
00:15:37.093 --> 00:15:38.853
Obviously given to
a family that could


225
00:15:38.888 --> 00:15:41.787
provide him with so much
more than I ever could.


226
00:15:51.728 --> 00:15:52.522
So.

227
00:15:54.973 --> 00:15:57.493
How are you emotionally?

228
00:15:57.527 --> 00:15:58.735
- I get by.

229
00:15:58.770 --> 00:16:01.359
- It's important to
keep your mind afloat


230
00:16:01.393 --> 00:16:03.119
during this period.

231
00:16:03.153 --> 00:16:04.707
It's your greatest tool.

232
00:16:04.741 --> 00:16:06.122
Healthy mind, healthy body.

233
00:16:06.156 --> 00:16:08.158
That's what your
baby needs right now.


234
00:16:08.193 --> 00:16:09.643
You're going to be
on my strict regiment


235
00:16:09.677 --> 00:16:12.266
of vitamins and supplements as
long as you're here with us.


236
00:16:12.301 --> 00:16:13.198
Thank you Paula.

237
00:16:15.407 --> 00:16:16.408
Poor Paula.

238
00:16:17.582 --> 00:16:19.169
She's a little rough
around the edges,


239
00:16:19.204 --> 00:16:20.654
but you must never
take anything she


240
00:16:20.688 --> 00:16:22.172
says or does personally.

241
00:16:25.762 --> 00:16:26.591
Come.

242
00:16:45.472 --> 00:16:48.889
Mary, it's my job to ensure
the safety of your child.


243
00:16:48.923 --> 00:16:49.993
I only want the best for it

244
00:16:50.028 --> 00:16:51.270
and I know you do to.

245
00:16:51.305 --> 00:16:53.307
After all, that's why
you're here isn't it?


246
00:17:02.109 --> 00:17:04.525
I ask you a very
simple question.


247
00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:06.665
Are you here of
your own volition?


248
00:17:08.633 --> 00:17:11.463
In other words, and
you know that I'm


249
00:17:11.498 --> 00:17:13.051
certainly not one to judge,

250
00:17:14.017 --> 00:17:15.364
I want to know that you're here

251
00:17:15.398 --> 00:17:17.504
because you understand
that you are not


252
00:17:17.538 --> 00:17:19.678
responsible enough
to care for the child


253
00:17:19.713 --> 00:17:21.197
growing inside of
you on your own.


254
00:17:21.231 --> 00:17:22.854
- I come here because
I am responsible


255
00:17:22.888 --> 00:17:26.547
and I'm asking for help to
bring my child into this world.


256
00:17:28.411 --> 00:17:30.309
But I'm not giving up my baby.

257
00:17:30.344 --> 00:17:32.381
- Well that's certainly
your decision.


258
00:17:32.415 --> 00:17:35.453
But while you are here
you will be our postulant.


259
00:17:35.487 --> 00:17:37.489
You will live as we do.

260
00:17:37.524 --> 00:17:39.629
Giving yourself over
entirely to the Lord


261
00:17:39.664 --> 00:17:40.975
in service and submission.

262
00:17:42.114 --> 00:17:43.978
Do you know where
that money comes from?


263
00:17:45.221 --> 00:17:47.188
The money that puts
food in our mouths


264
00:17:47.223 --> 00:17:48.397
and keeps the lights on.

265
00:17:49.467 --> 00:17:50.502
- No, no I don't.

266
00:17:50.537 --> 00:17:52.642
- It comes from our sponsors.

267
00:17:52.677 --> 00:17:54.989
People who believe as I
do that women like you


268
00:17:55.024 --> 00:17:56.543
simply don't know
right from wrong.


269
00:17:56.577 --> 00:17:58.786
That you don't have any
degree of responsibility.


270
00:17:58.821 --> 00:18:02.583
Certainly not enough to
care for a child on your own


271
00:18:02.618 --> 00:18:03.929
and that you need help.

272
00:18:03.964 --> 00:18:07.346
Please, don't mistake
my gratitude for greed.


273
00:18:07.381 --> 00:18:09.970
After all, you've seen the
state of things around here.


274
00:18:11.074 --> 00:18:14.008
And the other girls
are so sloppy.


275
00:18:15.665 --> 00:18:17.909
I believe that you
could be the blessing


276
00:18:17.943 --> 00:18:19.704
that we've been waiting for.

277
00:18:19.738 --> 00:18:22.569
After all, people want to
give to someone like you.


278
00:18:22.603 --> 00:18:24.536
Someone who gives them hope.

279
00:18:24.571 --> 00:18:25.813
- I don't feel well--

280
00:18:25.848 --> 00:18:27.608
- And Father Andrew
is going to be your


281
00:18:27.643 --> 00:18:30.404
divine witness to
your commitment to us.


282
00:18:31.957 --> 00:18:35.685
[heavy breathing]
[loud rumbling]


283
00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:37.307
- [Mary] Something,

284
00:18:39.551 --> 00:18:41.070
something's wrong.

285
00:18:43.728 --> 00:18:46.489
[faint whispering]

286
00:18:46.524 --> 00:18:50.251
- [Narrator] Mary, do you know
what happened to my sailboat?


287
00:18:50.286 --> 00:18:51.494
- No I don't.

288
00:18:51.529 --> 00:18:53.254
But we'll find it
in the morning okay?


289
00:18:56.016 --> 00:18:58.467
Remember that secret vacation
I've been telling you about?


290
00:18:58.501 --> 00:19:00.054
- Yeah.

291
00:19:00.089 --> 00:19:02.194
- We might be going a lot
sooner than I thought.


292
00:19:02.229 --> 00:19:05.577
You, me, Jimmy,
finally away from dad.


293
00:19:05.612 --> 00:19:06.578
Right, I love you.

294
00:19:08.235 --> 00:19:09.063
Go to sleep.

295
00:19:12.619 --> 00:19:14.724
[humming]

296
00:19:18.245 --> 00:19:20.903
[water running]

297
00:19:24.009 --> 00:19:26.840
[trumpet playing]

298
00:19:43.408 --> 00:19:45.168
I said go home.

299
00:19:45.203 --> 00:19:47.170
- And I tried.

300
00:19:47.205 --> 00:19:48.447
I already missed you.

301
00:19:54.246 --> 00:19:56.801
[ominous music]

302
00:19:56.835 --> 00:19:59.735
[melancholy music]

303
00:20:01.599 --> 00:20:02.427
- Mary.

304
00:20:11.609 --> 00:20:14.473
[heavy breathing]

305
00:20:39.775 --> 00:20:42.467
[ominous music]

306
00:20:50.095 --> 00:20:51.752
- Well good morning.

307
00:20:51.787 --> 00:20:54.168
I'm so glad to see you up.

308
00:20:54.203 --> 00:20:57.033
I thought you were going
to sleep all winter.


309
00:20:57.068 --> 00:20:58.690
- What time is it?

310
00:20:58.725 --> 00:21:02.383
- It's time for a fresh
new start for everyone.


311
00:21:03.626 --> 00:21:05.421
And Sarah's going to
help you with yours.


312
00:21:12.739 --> 00:21:14.533
- Sarah, what day is it?

313
00:21:14.568 --> 00:21:15.396
- Shh.

314
00:21:19.815 --> 00:21:20.609
Tuesday.

315
00:21:21.679 --> 00:21:23.784
No, Wednesday.

316
00:21:25.717 --> 00:21:26.994
I don't know actually.

317
00:21:28.927 --> 00:21:30.135
They blend together.

318
00:21:31.689 --> 00:21:34.070
Would you mind sitting
so I can reach your hair?


319
00:21:40.974 --> 00:21:42.389
Do you want a boy or a girl?

320
00:21:43.493 --> 00:21:44.322
- I'm not sure.

321
00:21:46.773 --> 00:21:48.775
I'm not sure of much
right now actually.


322
00:21:50.915 --> 00:21:53.538
- They say boys are easier
to raise than girls.


323
00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:57.749
I had a boy when
I first got here.


324
00:22:02.305 --> 00:22:03.548
He died in childbirth.

325
00:22:05.964 --> 00:22:07.552
They showed me a picture though.

326
00:22:08.518 --> 00:22:09.658
He was beautiful.

327
00:22:18.736 --> 00:22:21.117
- I miss you Jimmy, every day.

328
00:22:22.291 --> 00:22:23.775
I suppose it would
be redundant to ask


329
00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:26.226
if you're staying
out of trouble.


330
00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:28.884
I'm starting to wonder
if I made a mistake.


331
00:22:28.918 --> 00:22:30.609
But I'm hopeful
it's just going to


332
00:22:30.644 --> 00:22:32.715
take some time to adjust.

333
00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:34.372
Write me back.

334
00:22:34.406 --> 00:22:35.718
Tell me you love
me and we are doing


335
00:22:35.753 --> 00:22:37.202
what's best for our family.

336
00:22:38.756 --> 00:22:39.653
- She'll read it.

337
00:22:46.384 --> 00:22:47.385
Who's it to?

338
00:22:48.386 --> 00:22:49.249
- The father.

339
00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:52.804
- Just remember,

340
00:22:54.081 --> 00:22:55.876
there's no guarantee
she'll send it.

- [Catherine] I don't
feel well, I need to...

351
00:24:11.952 --> 00:24:13.505
Would you like to be excused?

00:24:14.713 --> 00:24:16.129
- Yes.

353
00:24:16.163 --> 00:24:19.408
- Of course, you just need
to finish your supper.


354

you're fairly new here.

- And if I recall, don't you
also see your dead brother?

No.

I wanna leave.

I made a mistake and
I would like to leave.

you'll fair better

We're going to bring you
something to calm you down.

And everyone's gonna
get a good night sleep.

You do not deserve

My child, you came here to
give your baby a better life.

Now we can let that happen.

There we are.

Was it her?

- She won't miss the child.

It was my husband.

00:40:48.085 --> 00:40:49.086

551
00:40:52.676 --> 00:40:53.470
He died.

552
00:40:55.886 --> 00:40:56.714
I didn't.

This baby is all I

I'm sorry.

For what she did to
you, really I am.

But you need to
keep your head down.

00:41:09.279 --> 00:41:10.521
- She put me in a coffin.

- You to try and
do what she says.

If you fight her,
that coffin will be

I was supposed to
be watching him.

He drowned because of me.

He haunts me.

In fact, you're very very sick.

You're certainly not fit
to be anyone's mother.

- [Mother] And how does
that make you feel?

control and helpless.

does your family feel

all abandoned me.

I could be dead.

578

They don't seem to care.

you might think I'm crazy.

Maybe I am.

We eat breakfast with the

Good as new.

664
00:47:25.965 --> 00:47:27.622
- [Mary] Where am I?

665
00:47:30.246 --> 00:47:32.109
- The doctor has been called

666
00:47:32.144 --> 00:47:34.181
and he is on his way.

667
00:47:34.215 --> 00:47:35.389
Thank you again.

668
00:47:35.423 --> 00:47:37.149
Paula will you see
the Wrights out?


669
00:47:37.184 --> 00:47:38.323
- No don't go.

670
00:47:39.738 --> 00:47:41.153
Don't go.

671
00:47:41.188 --> 00:47:42.465
Come back!

672
00:47:42.499 --> 00:47:43.328
Don't go!

673
00:47:44.260 --> 00:47:45.226
- Oh Agatha.

674
00:47:51.646 --> 00:47:52.647
Get out!

675
00:47:52.682 --> 00:47:53.855
Out of my bed!

676
00:47:55.132 --> 00:47:55.961
Leave!

677
00:47:57.065 --> 00:47:59.206
[sobbing]

678
00:48:26.888 --> 00:48:29.650
Oh, we must clean that
before it becomes infected.


679
00:48:31.134 --> 00:48:33.447
[screaming]

680
00:48:39.073 --> 00:48:42.179
When you disobey me,
it stings like salt


681
00:48:42.214 --> 00:48:43.284
on an open wound.

682
00:48:46.874 --> 00:48:50.498
[light singing in
foreign language]


683
00:48:50.533 --> 00:48:53.225
[faint ringing]

684
00:48:54.813 --> 00:48:56.435
- Just answer the
god damn phone.


685
00:49:00.094 --> 00:49:01.164
God damn it.

686
00:49:12.831 --> 00:49:14.246
Operator, I've got a
little bit of an emergency.


687
00:49:14.281 --> 00:49:15.420
Could you give me
the address for the


688
00:49:15.454 --> 00:49:17.111
phone number I've
been trying to reach?


689
00:49:18.940 --> 00:49:19.872
Alright, thank you.

690
00:49:38.581 --> 00:49:40.203
- I'm leaving here.

691
00:49:41.238 --> 00:49:42.481
I swear to God.

692
00:49:44.069 --> 00:49:46.727
- Next time I'm coming with you.

693
00:49:53.250 --> 00:49:54.079
- Not you two.

694
00:50:01.086 --> 00:50:04.400
Paula tells me that you two
are becoming fast friends.


695
00:50:05.849 --> 00:50:07.195
I think that's splendid.

696
00:50:08.680 --> 00:50:11.165
Did you enjoy breakfast
the other morning Agatha?


697
00:50:13.167 --> 00:50:14.513
I thought it was wonderful.

698
00:50:16.446 --> 00:50:20.830
It's so rare that we allow
ourselves such an indulgence.


699
00:50:20.864 --> 00:50:23.488
But I think our donors are happy

700
00:50:23.522 --> 00:50:26.042
when they see us
well fed and healthy.


701
00:50:27.146 --> 00:50:29.079
Didn't you enjoy it Catherine?

702
00:50:29.114 --> 00:50:29.942
- Yes.

703
00:50:30.840 --> 00:50:31.875
- Yes.

704
00:50:31.910 --> 00:50:34.084
[chuckling]

705
00:50:34.119 --> 00:50:35.016
Sometimes,

706
00:50:37.225 --> 00:50:38.710
all I will need is to eat

707
00:50:38.744 --> 00:50:41.022
a single perfect strawberry

708
00:50:42.714 --> 00:50:44.854
as proof of God's love.

709
00:50:46.269 --> 00:50:47.753
- I wasn't at the breakfast.

710
00:50:48.789 --> 00:50:49.962
- You weren't?

711
00:50:52.068 --> 00:50:53.310
Oh that's right.

712
00:50:53.345 --> 00:50:55.761
You were running around
like an insane person.


713
00:50:55.796 --> 00:50:56.590
Sit down!

714
00:50:58.281 --> 00:51:00.939
Embarrassing me in
front of our donors.


715
00:51:02.423 --> 00:51:05.530
This entire place runs on
their donations Agatha.


716
00:51:05.564 --> 00:51:07.566
They want to see a
healthy, beautiful,


717
00:51:07.601 --> 00:51:09.672
intelligent,
well-adjusted young woman.


718
00:51:09.706 --> 00:51:13.296
They don't want to see
someone plagued be demons.


719
00:51:13.330 --> 00:51:15.402
They care not for your darkness.

720
00:51:15.436 --> 00:51:16.368
Do you understand?

721
00:51:17.783 --> 00:51:18.577
Do you understand!

722
00:51:18.612 --> 00:51:19.440
- Yes!

723
00:51:23.133 --> 00:51:26.136
- You're just a wise-ass
little bitch aren't you?


724
00:51:26.171 --> 00:51:28.794
You will not raise your voice
in the house of the Lord.


725
00:51:28.829 --> 00:51:31.314
And you will never raise
your voice to me again.


726
00:51:31.348 --> 00:51:32.280
Is that understood?

727
00:51:33.247 --> 00:51:34.075
- Yes.

728
00:51:35.318 --> 00:51:36.112
- I can't hear you.

729
00:51:36.146 --> 00:51:37.320
- [Mary] Yes.

730
00:51:37.354 --> 00:51:38.148
- I can't hear you.

731
00:51:38.183 --> 00:51:39.495
- [Mary] Yes.

732
00:51:39.529 --> 00:51:40.565
- Say it again.

733
00:51:40.599 --> 00:51:41.428
- Yes.

734
00:51:41.462 --> 00:51:42.359
- [Mother] Say it again.

735
00:51:42.394 --> 00:51:43.533
- Yes.

736
00:51:43.568 --> 00:51:44.810
- Yes, yes, yes,
yes, yes, yes, yes.


737
00:51:44.845 --> 00:51:46.398
You will drive those
demons from your head


738
00:51:46.433 --> 00:51:48.814
and think only of your baby.

739
00:51:48.849 --> 00:51:49.850
Now get out.

740
00:52:00.205 --> 00:52:03.691
As I said before, the money
simply isn't available.


741
00:52:03.726 --> 00:52:05.313
But you of all
people should know


742
00:52:05.348 --> 00:52:06.763
that I have done more for you

743
00:52:06.798 --> 00:52:09.145
than anyone would have dreamed.

744
00:52:09.179 --> 00:52:09.973
Now,

745
00:52:11.181 --> 00:52:12.976
please remember that
the harsh reality


746
00:52:13.011 --> 00:52:15.496
is none of us have any
other real options.


747
00:52:34.273 --> 00:52:35.758
We have a problem.

748
00:52:39.244 --> 00:52:40.487
You have a visitor.

749
00:52:40.521 --> 00:52:42.109
And at some point you
will explain to me


750
00:52:42.143 --> 00:52:44.076
how this boy came to
be on this property.


751
00:52:44.111 --> 00:52:45.975
But now he endangers us all.

752
00:52:46.009 --> 00:52:47.632
So you're going to make
sure that he's alone


753
00:52:47.666 --> 00:52:49.426
and that he leaves.

754
00:52:49.461 --> 00:52:51.532
Sister Susan is
an excellent shot


755
00:52:51.567 --> 00:52:53.327
and I can assure
you, she won't be


756
00:52:53.361 --> 00:52:55.191
pointing that at you.

757
00:52:55.225 --> 00:52:57.952
Because I would never do
anything to endanger my child.


758
00:52:58.815 --> 00:53:00.403
[loud banging]

759
00:53:00.437 --> 00:53:02.819
Now, let's go say hello.

760
00:53:06.443 --> 00:53:08.342
[creaking]

761
00:53:08.376 --> 00:53:09.999
- Mary Lou as I live and--

762
00:53:10.033 --> 00:53:11.483
Look how big you've gotten!

763
00:53:11.518 --> 00:53:12.553
Oh my god.

764
00:53:12.588 --> 00:53:13.796
- Please, it's okay, stop.

765
00:53:14.900 --> 00:53:16.661
I don't wanna see you anymore.

766
00:53:16.695 --> 00:53:18.386
- You don't know what
you're talking about.


767
00:53:18.421 --> 00:53:20.078
I traveled 300
damn miles to come


768
00:53:20.112 --> 00:53:21.217
down here and see you.

769
00:53:22.494 --> 00:53:23.322
- Are you alone?

770
00:53:25.324 --> 00:53:26.153
- Yeah.

771
00:53:27.706 --> 00:53:28.914
- [Mary] And nobody
knows I'm here?


772
00:53:28.949 --> 00:53:30.502
[clanking]

773
00:53:30.537 --> 00:53:32.193
- No, of course not.

774
00:53:33.678 --> 00:53:35.058
- Good.

775
00:53:35.093 --> 00:53:36.439
I don't want you or
anyone from my past


776
00:53:36.473 --> 00:53:37.992
to be part of my baby's future.

777
00:53:39.062 --> 00:53:40.719
- Our baby's
future, my baby too.


778
00:53:40.754 --> 00:53:42.410
And what, what,

779
00:53:42.445 --> 00:53:43.480
I'm confused right now.

780
00:53:43.515 --> 00:53:44.309
What's happening?

781
00:53:44.343 --> 00:53:45.172
- Listen.

782
00:53:46.380 --> 00:53:47.588
Things are different now.

783
00:53:47.623 --> 00:53:49.107
- Okay, so things are different.

784
00:53:49.141 --> 00:53:50.833
Just listen to me.

785
00:53:50.867 --> 00:53:52.248
- I'm done listening.

786
00:53:52.282 --> 00:53:53.111
You have to go.

787
00:53:54.146 --> 00:53:56.390
If you love me you will go.

788
00:53:58.944 --> 00:54:00.670
- I don't understand.

789
00:54:01.982 --> 00:54:03.431
- You're just like my father.

790
00:54:04.571 --> 00:54:06.055
You just wanted to control me.

791
00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:09.127
- That's horseshit.

792
00:54:10.404 --> 00:54:11.198
No I didn't.

793
00:54:12.475 --> 00:54:13.510
- It's over James.

794
00:54:15.858 --> 00:54:17.687
This is my life now.

795
00:54:19.206 --> 00:54:20.621
- These people got in your head.

796
00:54:20.656 --> 00:54:21.484
- No.

797
00:54:21.518 --> 00:54:22.658
- [Jimmy] Yeah.

798
00:54:22.692 --> 00:54:25.453
- No, they've shown
me what matters.


799
00:54:25.488 --> 00:54:27.628
And you're not a
part of that anymore.


800
00:54:30.527 --> 00:54:31.563
- Yeah.

801
00:54:31.598 --> 00:54:32.426
- [Mary] Go.

802
00:54:34.531 --> 00:54:35.878
- Mary, come on now.

803
00:54:35.912 --> 00:54:37.120
- No, my name is Agatha.

804
00:54:42.505 --> 00:54:44.093
Go, you have to go.

805
00:54:45.404 --> 00:54:46.751
Please?

806
00:54:46.785 --> 00:54:49.167
- I'll go, if you come with me.

807
00:54:49.201 --> 00:54:50.375
- [Mary] No.

808
00:54:50.409 --> 00:54:51.894
- That's the only
way I'm leaving here.


809
00:54:51.928 --> 00:54:53.309
I'm not going
anywhere without you.


810
00:54:53.343 --> 00:54:54.655
I'm not leaving without you.
- No, no, no, stop.


811
00:54:54.690 --> 00:54:56.174
- I came all this way!
- No.


812
00:54:56.208 --> 00:54:57.831
- [Jimmy] Please don't
make me go over there--


813
00:54:57.865 --> 00:54:58.659
- It's not yours.

814
00:54:58.694 --> 00:55:00.523
It's not your child.

815
00:55:00.557 --> 00:55:01.593
It's not your child.

816
00:55:03.699 --> 00:55:04.596
- You're lying, come on.

817
00:55:04.631 --> 00:55:05.701
- [Mary] No, it's not yours.

818
00:55:05.735 --> 00:55:06.563
- No, you're lying.

819
00:55:06.598 --> 00:55:07.426
- Go, go!

820
00:55:08.255 --> 00:55:09.083
Go!

821
00:55:10.257 --> 00:55:13.053
Leave, it's not
your child, leave!


822
00:55:22.510 --> 00:55:24.720
[creaking]

823
00:55:30.484 --> 00:55:35.489
[singing in foreign language]
[sobbing]


824
00:56:07.417 --> 00:56:08.902
- [Catherine] It's
not your fault.


825
00:56:08.936 --> 00:56:10.420
- I sent him away.

826
00:56:10.455 --> 00:56:12.526
- They threatened to kill him.

827
00:56:12.560 --> 00:56:13.734
You didn't have a choice.

828

to thank all of you.

Not only for your time, but
for your generous donations

Please take this moment to
get to know each of them.

feeling better sweetheart?

Thank you again for
the help the other day.

I wasn't myself.

846
00:57:29.396 --> 00:57:30.880
- I have just one more question.

847
00:57:35.540 --> 00:57:36.575
- [Mary] We all have
to work together


848
00:57:36.610 --> 00:57:37.956
on getting out of here now.

Not tomorrow, not
in the morning, now.

safe in this place?

deliver your child into this?

Sarah if you know
something, please.

His name was David.

I gave birth and I
heard him crying.

I was excited to hold him

and they took him
out of the room.

The next morning when I woke up,

they told me he was dead.

I was drugged.

00:58:39.604 --> 00:58:42.158
But I know that I
heard him crying again.


866
00:58:44.367 --> 00:58:48.268
There were no other babies here.

867

And a mother knows the sound

going to be needing them

And it breaks my heart
because I love you so.

Loyal people don't
wag their tongues

ever cared about them.

am trying to do here

01:08:41.516 --> 01:08:44.311
[loud vibrating]

994
01:08:53.528 --> 01:08:54.598
- Help me!
[loud banging]


995
01:08:54.632 --> 01:08:56.047
Somebody help me!

996
01:09:13.099 --> 01:09:14.203
No.

997
01:09:14.238 --> 01:09:15.066
No!

998
01:09:16.274 --> 01:09:17.103
Jimmy!

999
01:09:18.035 --> 01:09:19.174
No!

1000
01:09:19.208 --> 01:09:21.763
[loud banging]

1001
01:09:26.526 --> 01:09:28.942
[shattering]

1002
01:09:36.916 --> 01:09:38.365
You.

1003
01:09:38.400 --> 01:09:40.160
You fucking monster.

1004
01:09:40.195 --> 01:09:43.198
- Oh Agatha, you look
positively dreadful.


1005
01:09:43.232 --> 01:09:44.855
- You killed him.

1006
01:09:44.889 --> 01:09:47.271
- More insane ramblings.

1007
01:09:47.305 --> 01:09:48.755
Killed who?

1008
01:09:48.790 --> 01:09:49.584
- Jimmy.

1009
01:09:49.618 --> 01:09:51.033
- Jimmy, he left.

1010
01:09:51.068 --> 01:09:52.379
Don't you remember?

1011
01:09:52.414 --> 01:09:53.242
- No, I'm leaving.

1012
01:09:53.277 --> 01:09:55.003
I'm leaving now.

1013
01:09:55.037 --> 01:09:57.557
- [Mother] Is this
not your signature?


1014
01:09:57.592 --> 01:09:58.869
- Fuck you.

1015
01:09:58.903 --> 01:10:01.837
- You see, more
anti-social behavior.


1016
01:10:01.872 --> 01:10:03.667
You're not well Agatha.

1017
01:10:03.701 --> 01:10:06.290
- Mary, Mary, Mary,
my name is Mary!


1018
01:10:06.324 --> 01:10:08.292
- We have several
witnesses that will attest


1019
01:10:08.326 --> 01:10:09.673
that this is your signature.

1020
01:10:09.707 --> 01:10:11.571
One of them being our
own Father Andrew.


1021
01:10:11.606 --> 01:10:12.848
- [Mary] Sit down!

1022
01:10:12.883 --> 01:10:15.333
- Agatha, don't you
think you've wasted


1023
01:10:15.368 --> 01:10:17.646
enough of everyone's time?

1024
01:10:17.681 --> 01:10:19.959
Delusions, hallucinations,

1025
01:10:19.993 --> 01:10:23.894
false memories, homicidal
ideations, insomnia.


1026
01:10:23.928 --> 01:10:27.000
These are very serious
conditions Agatha.


1027
01:10:27.035 --> 01:10:30.901
Which is why I also
had you sign this.


1028
01:10:30.935 --> 01:10:32.419
Power of Attorney.

1029
01:10:32.454 --> 01:10:34.732
Because you are
not of sound mind


1030
01:10:34.767 --> 01:10:38.874
to make your own
legal decisions.


1031
01:10:38.909 --> 01:10:41.049
I own you and your baby.

1032
01:10:41.083 --> 01:10:43.810
And there's absolutely
nothing you can do about it.


1033
01:10:43.845 --> 01:10:46.019
But for heavens sakes,
don't take my word for it.


1034
01:10:46.054 --> 01:10:48.332
Perhaps you'd like
to call somebody hmm?


1035
01:10:48.366 --> 01:10:51.507
I don't think Jimmy wants
to hear from you again.


1036
01:10:51.542 --> 01:10:53.475
But perhaps the authorities.

1037
01:10:53.509 --> 01:10:58.135
Yes, Paula, will you go
fetch a phone for Agatha?


1038
01:11:02.070 --> 01:11:03.036
We'll just wait.

1039
01:11:19.777 --> 01:11:21.020
Thank you Paula.

1040
01:11:21.054 --> 01:11:22.124
There you go.

1041
01:11:26.612 --> 01:11:27.543
Anyone you'd like.

1042
01:11:34.550 --> 01:11:37.277
- Yes, I'd like to
report a murder.


1043
01:11:37.312 --> 01:11:39.590
[laughing]

1044
01:11:42.041 --> 01:11:43.111
- Yes, of course.

1045
01:11:43.145 --> 01:11:44.837
Oh this should be very good.

1046
01:11:44.871 --> 01:11:46.286
Yes, by all means.

1047
01:11:46.321 --> 01:11:47.667
Tell them you've been
spending time at the convent


1048
01:11:47.702 --> 01:11:49.600
and sleeping in a coffin

1049
01:11:49.635 --> 01:11:52.430
and attending midnight
mass with faceless nuns.


1050
01:11:52.465 --> 01:11:54.674
And by all means,
tell them we forced


1051
01:11:54.709 --> 01:11:57.435
you to go by the name of Agatha.

1052
01:11:57.470 --> 01:12:00.059
All sounds a little bit
crazy to me don't you think?


1053
01:12:01.094 --> 01:12:02.682
- Yes.

1054
01:12:02.717 --> 01:12:03.821
Yes.

1055
01:12:03.856 --> 01:12:04.822
The convent.

1056
01:12:09.068 --> 01:12:09.862
Yes.

1057
01:12:15.315 --> 01:12:18.077
[sirens blaring]

1058
01:12:22.391 --> 01:12:23.220
Its over.

1059
01:12:24.117 --> 01:12:25.394
Get up.

1060
01:12:25.429 --> 01:12:26.257
Get up!

1061
01:12:29.847 --> 01:12:31.953
[loud coughing]

1062
01:12:31.987 --> 01:12:33.057
Open the door!

1063
01:12:44.551 --> 01:12:45.345
- Ma'am.

1064
01:12:45.380 --> 01:12:46.346
- Sir, please help me.

1065
01:12:46.381 --> 01:12:48.072
- Ma'am, that's far enough.

1066
01:12:48.107 --> 01:12:49.177
- Please help me.

1067
01:12:49.211 --> 01:12:50.626
This woman murdered my boyfriend

1068
01:12:50.661 --> 01:12:51.973
and she's keeping
me hostage and--


1069
01:12:52.007 --> 01:12:53.906
- I'm so sorry officer,
she's not well.


1070
01:12:53.940 --> 01:12:54.769
- He's upstairs.

1071
01:12:55.631 --> 01:12:58.013
- Ma'am, may I?

1072
01:12:58.048 --> 01:12:59.877
- I'd be disappointed
if you don't.


1073
01:13:00.844 --> 01:13:02.224
- He's upstairs.

1074
01:13:02.259 --> 01:13:03.191
Sir please.

1075
01:13:03.225 --> 01:13:04.054
He's upstairs.

1076
01:13:06.919 --> 01:13:08.265
His body was right there.

1077
01:13:09.818 --> 01:13:10.646
What?

1078
01:13:12.338 --> 01:13:15.617
They moved his body.

1079
01:13:15.651 --> 01:13:18.102
[loud coughing]

1080
01:13:18.137 --> 01:13:20.242
I don't know what's
real anymore.


1081
01:13:20.277 --> 01:13:21.519
I see things.

1082
01:13:23.729 --> 01:13:25.351
That's not me,
that's not my voice.


1083
01:13:25.385 --> 01:13:26.559
I mean, I don't know how she--

1084
01:13:26.593 --> 01:13:28.285
I killed my brother.

1085
01:13:28.319 --> 01:13:29.113
What?

1086
01:13:29.148 --> 01:13:30.080
No, I didn't say that.

1087
01:13:30.114 --> 01:13:31.598
I would never say that!

1088
01:13:31.633 --> 01:13:33.877
I didn't kill him,
he drowned but,


1089
01:13:33.911 --> 01:13:35.706
why are you looking
at me like that?


1090
01:13:35.741 --> 01:13:36.880
I'm not crazy.

1091
01:13:37.950 --> 01:13:39.192
- What happened to her head?

1092
01:13:39.227 --> 01:13:41.091
- She has a pension
for hurting herself.


1093
01:13:41.125 --> 01:13:43.196
This happened shortly
before you arrived.


1094
01:13:43.231 --> 01:13:44.542
- No!

1095
01:13:44.577 --> 01:13:45.336
- We simply haven't gotten
- No, shut up!


1096
01:13:45.371 --> 01:13:46.130
- Her cleaned up yet.

1097
01:13:46.165 --> 01:13:47.062
- She did this to me!

1098
01:13:47.097 --> 01:13:48.339
She's lying.

1099
01:13:48.374 --> 01:13:50.134
- You can see she's delusional.

1100
01:13:50.169 --> 01:13:51.480
She was sent here.

1101
01:13:51.515 --> 01:13:53.793
In there you'll find
a Power of Attorney.


1102
01:13:53.828 --> 01:13:55.588
She signed it over to us.

1103
01:13:56.934 --> 01:13:57.763
- [Mary] I don't remember--

1104
01:13:57.797 --> 01:13:58.694
- Over there.

1105
01:13:58.729 --> 01:14:00.386
- It's a sad case actually.

1106
01:14:00.420 --> 01:14:02.422
The father of the
child wants absolutely


1107
01:14:02.457 --> 01:14:03.872
nothing to do with her.

1108
01:14:05.598 --> 01:14:07.634
Paula, may I have
Jimmy's letters please?


1109
01:14:10.845 --> 01:14:11.811
Thank you.

1110
01:14:11.846 --> 01:14:13.054
There you go.

1111
01:14:13.088 --> 01:14:14.538
- That's not even
his handwriting!


1112
01:14:14.572 --> 01:14:15.642
Look, these are all fake.

1113
01:14:15.677 --> 01:14:16.782
They're all fake!

1114
01:14:16.816 --> 01:14:17.990
She wrote these.

1115
01:14:18.024 --> 01:14:19.785
- You see what we
have to put up with?


1116
01:14:22.926 --> 01:14:24.651
- [Narrator] Earl, what are
you doing out of the house?


1117
01:14:25.929 --> 01:14:27.137
- No.

1118
01:14:27.171 --> 01:14:28.345
- [Father] Are you okay miss?

1119
01:14:28.379 --> 01:14:29.587
Whoa, your head.

1120
01:14:29.622 --> 01:14:30.450
- No.

1121
01:14:31.382 --> 01:14:32.590
No, he's a part of this!

1122
01:14:34.454 --> 01:14:39.459
She controls him!
[light humming]


1123
01:14:40.184 --> 01:14:41.703
He's in on all of this!

1124
01:14:41.737 --> 01:14:44.257
He's a fraud, he's a priest!

1125
01:14:44.292 --> 01:14:45.811
- Sister, we gotta
get her to a hospital


1126
01:14:45.845 --> 01:14:46.984
as soon as we can.

1127
01:14:47.019 --> 01:14:48.330
- Sheriff, the doctor
was called shortly


1128
01:14:48.365 --> 01:14:49.297
before we called you.

1129
01:14:49.331 --> 01:14:50.539
He's on his way.

1130
01:14:51.747 --> 01:14:52.887
- [Father] Earl, let's
get you home alright.


1131
01:14:52.921 --> 01:14:54.889
- Officer, I run a
convent where the health


1132
01:14:54.923 --> 01:14:56.960
of my girls is paramount.

1133
01:14:56.994 --> 01:14:58.202
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask

1134
01:14:58.237 --> 01:15:00.791
you to leave and go
home and get well.


1135
01:15:02.897 --> 01:15:03.725
- Of course.

1136
01:15:05.175 --> 01:15:07.833
[ominous music]

1137
01:15:09.973 --> 01:15:11.043
- She's in labor.

1138
01:15:12.182 --> 01:15:13.700
- [Mother] Take her
to the basement.


1139
01:15:15.150 --> 01:15:16.220
- No, no, no!

Agatha.

- Where are you taking him?
[baby crying]

Where are you taking him?

[light humming]

- Mr. And Mrs. Wright,

1153
01:16:36.404 --> 01:16:37.715
I have something for you.

01:16:42.997 --> 01:16:44.930
- [Mrs. Wright] Our
daughter will love him.

[singing in foreign language]

1157
01:17:25.971 --> 01:17:27.489
- [Susan] She wants to see you.

1158
01:17:35.049 --> 01:17:36.153
She's here.

1159
01:17:38.535 --> 01:17:39.777
- Thank you sister Susan.

1160
01:17:40.951 --> 01:17:44.782
Sister, would you
ask Sarah to please


1161
01:17:44.817 --> 01:17:46.405
bring me a glass of ice water.

1162
01:17:47.751 --> 01:17:50.685
And bring one for Agatha,
she looks thirsty.


1163
01:18:01.178 --> 01:18:04.319
This whole garden is teaming
with rats and snakes.


1164
01:18:06.287 --> 01:18:08.806
- You're just going to
kill me after I give birth.


1165
01:18:09.669 --> 01:18:10.636
- I don't have to.

1166
01:18:12.914 --> 01:18:15.606
You have no idea how long
I have waited for this.


1167
01:18:17.367 --> 01:18:18.920
You can't run anymore.

1168
01:18:20.094 --> 01:18:22.613
You have no connection
to anyone or anything.


1169
01:18:23.476 --> 01:18:25.202
You're broken and damaged.

1170
01:18:26.652 --> 01:18:28.240
You've already killed one child.

1171
01:18:29.517 --> 01:18:30.794
Now the only thing
that's holding you back


1172
01:18:30.828 --> 01:18:32.520
is your own selfish
stubbornness.


1173
01:18:35.902 --> 01:18:37.939
Can't you see this
is not for you.


1174
01:18:39.527 --> 01:18:40.631
Wasn't for me either.

1175
01:18:43.841 --> 01:18:45.498
You've seen what I'm capable of.

1176
01:18:46.672 --> 01:18:48.777
What kind of a mother
do you think I'd be?


1177
01:18:48.812 --> 01:18:50.641
This is not who we are.

1178
01:18:51.815 --> 01:18:52.781
- You're right.

1179
01:18:52.816 --> 01:18:54.266
- Of course I'm right.

1180
01:18:54.300 --> 01:18:55.543
And there's a wonderful family

1181
01:18:55.577 --> 01:18:58.097
just waiting to take
care of your child.


1182
01:18:58.132 --> 01:18:59.202
- And pay you for it.

1183
01:19:03.137 --> 01:19:03.965
The donors.

1184
01:19:05.518 --> 01:19:07.002
You sell our babies.

1185
01:19:08.521 --> 01:19:10.903
Do they know that this
is not a real convent?


1186
01:19:10.937 --> 01:19:13.561
- Well now, that's a
matter of perspective.


1187
01:19:15.632 --> 01:19:18.945
They don't know that my
church turned it's back on me.


1188
01:19:18.980 --> 01:19:22.570
They do know that I'm
continuing to do God's work.


1189
01:19:22.604 --> 01:19:25.262
It didn't take much for me
to be able to stay here.


1190
01:19:25.297 --> 01:19:27.161
Church didn't want
a crumbling relic.


1191
01:19:28.231 --> 01:19:30.785
So I continued to do their work.

1192
01:19:32.269 --> 01:19:33.995
Only I'm turning a profit.

1193
01:19:36.791 --> 01:19:41.036
Susan, Helen, and Olga,
have become far too greedy.


1194
01:19:43.418 --> 01:19:45.696
Sarah's too simple to
be good for anything


1195
01:19:45.731 --> 01:19:47.146
other than manual labor.

1196
01:19:47.181 --> 01:19:49.044
And that of course leaves Paula.

1197
01:19:49.079 --> 01:19:51.081
And I can barely stand her.

1198
01:19:53.601 --> 01:19:56.776
But there are going to be
so many women coming to me.


1199
01:19:56.811 --> 01:19:58.019
I'm going to need help.

1200
01:20:00.194 --> 01:20:01.091
- Would I be paid?

1201
01:20:02.817 --> 01:20:04.819
- Well of course.

1202
01:20:04.853 --> 01:20:05.820
And handsomely.

1203
01:20:07.062 --> 01:20:09.272
I always take care of
everyone in my employ.


1204
01:20:10.204 --> 01:20:11.515
I'm not running a charity.

1205
01:20:15.243 --> 01:20:16.417
- [Mary] Do you have
proof that these


1206
01:20:16.451 --> 01:20:17.694
children have gone
to good homes?


1207
01:20:18.936 --> 01:20:19.834
- Of course.

1208
01:20:24.873 --> 01:20:28.877
This ledge contains
records of every child


1209
01:20:28.912 --> 01:20:30.189
that I've ever given away.

1210
01:20:31.811 --> 01:20:34.469
As you can see,
they're much better off


1211
01:20:34.504 --> 01:20:37.196
than they would have been
with their pathetic mothers.

You have 24 hours to decide.

1214
01:20:51.072 --> 01:20:55.283
Paula, please fetch
Agatha some supper


1215
01:20:55.318 --> 01:20:56.802
and then take her to her room.

I think I'm...
[heavy breathing]


1219
01:21:27.833 --> 01:21:29.800
- I understand that
you are frustrated.


1220
01:21:29.835 --> 01:21:31.043
I hear it in your voice,

1221
01:21:31.077 --> 01:21:32.286
but you promised me
that I would have


1222
01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:33.528
at least until Spring to pay.

1223
01:21:33.563 --> 01:21:35.150
- Mother.

1224
01:21:35.185 --> 01:21:36.531
It's Agatha, it's time.

1225
01:21:43.504 --> 01:21:47.024
- I think it was
just pain, I'm fine.


1226
01:21:47.059 --> 01:21:48.923
It was just pain.

1227
01:21:48.957 --> 01:21:51.995
I think, I'm sorry
about the food.


1228
01:21:52.029 --> 01:21:53.755

1229

- Alright.

1231
01:21:56.586 --> 01:21:59.899
Paula, will you take
Agatha back to the room


1232
01:21:59.934 --> 01:22:01.591
and get her another
plate of food?


1233
01:22:05.526 --> 01:22:06.320
- Sorry.

you come here please?


1237
01:23:36.271 --> 01:23:37.411
Is Agatha asleep?

1238
01:23:37.445 --> 01:23:39.274
- [Paula] Yes
mother, she's asleep.


1239
01:23:39.309 --> 01:23:40.690
- [Mother] Are you sure?

1240
01:23:40.724 --> 01:23:42.139
- [Paula] Yes.

1241
01:23:42.174 --> 01:23:44.279
- [Mother] I want you to
make sure she stays that way.


1242
01:23:44.314 --> 01:23:45.591
- [Paula] Yes I understand.

1243
01:23:45.626 --> 01:23:48.076
- [Mother] She's been
quite disappointing.


1244

Hit her over the
head if you have to.


1245

- [Paula] Yes
mother, I understand.

I'll take care of her.

Sister Susan?

[creaking]

Shall I bring Sarah
her supper now?


1252
01:25:53.408 --> 01:25:54.237
- [Mother] No.

1253
01:25:55.652 --> 01:25:58.206
Just keep her where she
is for the next few days.


1254
01:25:59.069 --> 01:26:00.554
She needs to learn her lesson.

1255
01:26:02.072 --> 01:26:04.074
- [Paula] Yes of
course, I understand.


1256
01:26:06.525 --> 01:26:08.113
- [Mother] Keep her door locked.

1257
01:26:09.494 --> 01:26:12.151
Stupid girl won't know
anything's different anyway.


1258
01:26:13.359 --> 01:26:14.429
- [Paula] Yes I agree.

1259

leaving it up to you.

01:26:33.863 --> 01:26:35.589

1264
01:26:35.623 --> 01:26:36.900
- [Mother] Paula.

1265

- [Paula] Yes.

1266
01:26:38.384 --> 01:26:40.835
- [Mother] When Agatha leaves,
we're going to be empty.


1267
01:26:40.870 --> 01:26:44.045
I need you to start
