1
00:00:36.441 --> 00:00:38.734
This is Berk.

2
00:00:38.902 --> 00:00:43.280
It's twelve days north of hopeless and a
few degrees south of freezing to death.


3
00:00:43.448 --> 00:00:47.201
It's located solidly
on the meridian of misery.


4
00:00:48.161 --> 00:00:51.789
My village. In a word, sturdy.

5
00:00:51.957 --> 00:00:56.627
It's been here for seven generations,
but every single building is new.


6
00:00:56.795 --> 00:01:00.840
We have fishing, hunting
and a charming view of the sunsets.


7
00:01:01.007 --> 00:01:04.009
The only problems are the pests.

8
00:01:05.011 --> 00:01:08.431
You see, most places
have mice or mosquitoes.


9
00:01:08.598 --> 00:01:10.766
We have...

10
00:01:13.645 --> 00:01:15.062
...dragons.

11
00:01:16.231 --> 00:01:18.649
Most people would leave. Not us.

12
00:01:18.817 --> 00:01:22.445
We're Vikings.
We have stubbornness issues.


13
00:01:24.614 --> 00:01:25.614
My name is Hiccup.

14
00:01:26.533 --> 00:01:29.160
Great name, I know.
But it's not the worst.


15
00:01:29.327 --> 00:01:32.997
Parents believe a hideous name
will frighten off gnomes and trolls.


16
00:01:33.165 --> 00:01:35.499
Like our charming Viking demeanor
wouldn't do that.


17
00:01:36.668 --> 00:01:37.668
Morning!

18
00:01:39.838 --> 00:01:41.672
- What are you doing here?!
- Get inside!


19
00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.633
- What are you doing out?!
- Get back inside!


20
00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:51.724
Hiccup! What is he doing?
What are you doing out?! Get inside!


21
00:01:51.892 --> 00:01:55.519
That's Stoick the Vast,
chief of the tribe.


22
00:01:55.687 --> 00:02:00.524
When he was a baby, he popped
a dragon's head clean off its shoulders.


23
00:02:00.692 --> 00:02:02.777
Do I believe it? Yes, I do.

24
00:02:02.944 --> 00:02:03.944
What have we got?

25
00:02:04.112 --> 00:02:07.907
Gronckles. Nadders. Zipplebacks.
Hoark saw a Monstrous Nightmare.


26
00:02:09.367 --> 00:02:11.494
- Any Night Furies?
- None so far.


27
00:02:11.661 --> 00:02:12.703
Good.

28
00:02:12.871 --> 00:02:14.705
Hoist the torches!

29
00:02:20.378 --> 00:02:23.547
Nice of you to join the party!
I thought you'd been carried off!


30
00:02:23.715 --> 00:02:28.552
Who, me? No, come on,
I'm way too muscular for their taste.


31
00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.889
They wouldn't know
what to do with all this.


32
00:02:32.057 --> 00:02:33.891
They need toothpicks, don't they?

33
00:02:35.018 --> 00:02:38.270
The meathead with attitude
and interchangeable hands is Gobber.


34
00:02:38.438 --> 00:02:42.900
I've been his apprentice
since I was little. Well, littler.


35
00:02:43.235 --> 00:02:47.071
Move to the lower defenses.
We'll counterattack with the catapults.


36
00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:48.364
Hurry!

37
00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:52.743
See? Old village,
lots and lots of new houses.


38
00:02:53.203 --> 00:02:54.245
Fire!

39
00:02:54.412 --> 00:02:55.704
Let's go!

40
00:02:56.331 --> 00:03:00.459
That's Fishlegs, Snotlout, the twins:
Ruffnut and Tuffnut...


41
00:03:01.002 --> 00:03:02.211
...and...

42
00:03:03.922 --> 00:03:05.422
...Astrid.

43
00:03:15.517 --> 00:03:17.810
Their job is so much cooler.

44
00:03:18.937 --> 00:03:22.356
Come on. Let me out, please.
I need to make my mark.


45
00:03:22.524 --> 00:03:25.442
You've made plenty of marks,
all in the wrong places.


46
00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.444
Please, two minutes. 
I'll kill a dragon.

47
00:03:27.612 --> 00:03:30.781
My life will get infinitely better.
I might even get a date.


48
00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:33.617
You can't lift a hammer.
You can't swing an axe.


49
00:03:33.785 --> 00:03:35.327
You can't even throw one of these!

50
00:03:37.664 --> 00:03:40.666
OK, fine,
but this will throw it for me.


51
00:03:42.294 --> 00:03:45.212
See? Now this right here
is what I'm talking about!


52
00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.423
- Mild calibration issue...
- Hiccup!


53
00:03:47.591 --> 00:03:50.634
If you ever want to get out there
to fight dragons...


54
00:03:50.802 --> 00:03:53.804
...you need to stop all this.

55
00:03:53.972 --> 00:03:56.056
But you just pointed to all of me.

56
00:03:56.224 --> 00:03:59.602
Yes, that's it!
Stop being all of you.


57
00:04:00.645 --> 00:04:01.770
Oh, yes.

58
00:04:01.938 --> 00:04:04.648
You, sir,
are playing a dangerous game.


59
00:04:04.816 --> 00:04:08.819
Keeping this much
raw Vikingness contained?


60
00:04:08.987 --> 00:04:10.654
There will be consequences!

61
00:04:10.822 --> 00:04:14.283
I'll take my chances.
Sword. Sharpen. Now.


62
00:04:15.744 --> 00:04:19.997
One day, I'll get out there.
Because killing a dragon...


63
00:04:20.165 --> 00:04:21.999
...is everything around here.

64
00:04:23.251 --> 00:04:26.670
A Nadder head is sure
to get me at least noticed.


65
00:04:26.838 --> 00:04:28.255
Gronckles are tough.

66
00:04:28.423 --> 00:04:31.675
Taking down one of those
would definitely get me a girlfriend.


67
00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:33.802
A Zippleback?

68
00:04:35.347 --> 00:04:37.765
Exotic. Two heads, twice the status.

69
00:04:37.933 --> 00:04:39.183
They found the sheep!

70
00:04:39.351 --> 00:04:41.518
Concentrate fire over the lower bank.

71
00:04:41.686 --> 00:04:43.354
- Hurry up!
- Fire!


72
00:04:44.147 --> 00:04:46.690
And then there's
the Monstrous Nightmare.


73
00:04:46.858 --> 00:04:49.735
Only the best Vikings go after those.

74
00:04:49.903 --> 00:04:53.864
They have this nasty habit
of setting themselves on fire.


75
00:04:55.784 --> 00:04:58.202
Reload! I'll take care of this.

76
00:04:59.621 --> 00:05:03.707
But the ultimate prize
is the dragon no one's ever seen.


77
00:05:03.875 --> 00:05:05.876
- We call it the...
- Night Fury!


78
00:05:06.044 --> 00:05:07.378
Get down!

79
00:05:10.382 --> 00:05:11.882
Jump!

80
00:05:12.717 --> 00:05:16.428
This thing never steals food,
never shows itself and...


81
00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:19.682
...never misses.

82
00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:24.603
No one has ever killed a Night Fury.
That's why I'm going to be the first.


83
00:05:24.771 --> 00:05:27.898
Man the fort, Hiccup.
They need me out there.


84
00:05:29.526 --> 00:05:32.277
Stay. Put. There.

85
00:05:33.738 --> 00:05:35.447
You know what I mean.

86
00:05:36.908 --> 00:05:39.076
- Where are you going?
- Yeah, I know!


87
00:05:39.244 --> 00:05:40.619
- Hiccup!
- Be right back!


88
00:05:46.376 --> 00:05:47.751
Let's get him!

89
00:05:48.294 --> 00:05:49.753
Mind yourselves!

90
00:05:49.921 --> 00:05:51.922
The devils still have
some juice in them!


91
00:06:01.975 --> 00:06:05.269
Come on. Give me something to
shoot at. Give me something to shoot at.


92
00:06:27.959 --> 00:06:30.627
I hit it. Yes, I hit it!

93
00:06:30.837 --> 00:06:32.838
Did anybody see that?

94
00:06:34.257 --> 00:06:35.507
Except for you.

95
00:06:41.473 --> 00:06:43.891
- Do not let them escape!
- Right!


96
00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:04.328
You're all out.

97
00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:13.003
Oh, and there's one more thing
you need to know.


98
00:07:23.473 --> 00:07:25.474
Sorry, Dad.

99
00:07:34.943 --> 00:07:36.693
OK, but I hit a Night Fury.

100
00:07:37.237 --> 00:07:41.281
It's not like the last few times, Dad!
I really, actually hit it!


101
00:07:41.449 --> 00:07:43.700
You guys were busy.
I had a very clear shot.


102
00:07:43.868 --> 00:07:47.371
It went down off Raven Point.
Let's get a search party...


103
00:07:47.539 --> 00:07:48.831
Stop!

104
00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:51.041
Just stop.

105
00:07:51.376 --> 00:07:54.419
Every time you step outside,
disaster follows.


106
00:07:54.587 --> 00:07:56.630
Can you not see that
I have bigger problems?


107
00:07:56.798 --> 00:08:00.384
Winter is almost here
and I have an entire village to feed!


108
00:08:01.553 --> 00:08:05.639
Between you and me, the village
could do with a little less feeding.


109
00:08:05.807 --> 00:08:07.724
This isn't a joke, Hiccup!

110
00:08:07.892 --> 00:08:11.061
Why can't you follow
the simplest orders?


111
00:08:11.229 --> 00:08:15.858
I can't stop myself. I see a dragon
and I have to just kill it.


112
00:08:16.025 --> 00:08:18.026
It's who I am, Dad.

113
00:08:18.194 --> 00:08:23.407
You're many things, Hiccup.
But a dragon killer is not one of them.


114
00:08:23.741 --> 00:08:25.367
Get back to the house.

115
00:08:25.702 --> 00:08:27.494
Make sure he gets there.

116
00:08:27.912 --> 00:08:30.289
I have his mess to clean up.

117
00:08:31.332 --> 00:08:32.541
Quite the performance.

118
00:08:32.709 --> 00:08:35.502
I've never seen anyone
mess up that badly. That helped.


119
00:08:35.670 --> 00:08:38.297
Thank you, thank you. I was trying.

120
00:08:41.759 --> 00:08:43.760
- I really did hit one.
- Sure, Hiccup.


121
00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:46.180
- He never listens.
- It runs in the family.


122
00:08:46.347 --> 00:08:49.099
When he does,
it's with this disappointed scowl,


123
00:08:49.267 --> 00:08:51.685
like someone skimped on meat
in his sandwich.


124
00:08:51.853 --> 00:08:55.898
"Excuse me, barmaid.
You brought me the wrong offspring.


125
00:08:56.065 --> 00:09:00.819
I ordered an extra-large boy with beefy
arms, extra guts and glory on the side.


126
00:09:00.987 --> 00:09:03.739
This here, this is a talking fishbone."

127
00:09:03.907 --> 00:09:05.949
You're thinking about this wrong.

128
00:09:06.117 --> 00:09:10.579
It's not so much what you look like,
it's what's inside that he can't stand.


129
00:09:11.664 --> 00:09:13.123
Thank you for summing that up.

130
00:09:13.458 --> 00:09:17.502
Look, the point is, stop trying
so hard to be something you're not.


131
00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:20.005
I just want to
be one of you guys.

132
00:09:30.099 --> 00:09:33.101
Either we finish them
or they'll finish us!


133
00:09:33.645 --> 00:09:35.812
It's the only way
we'll be rid of them.


134
00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:37.981
If we find the nest and destroy it,

135
00:09:38.149 --> 00:09:41.318
the dragons will leave.
They'll find another home!


136
00:09:41.486 --> 00:09:43.987
One more search
before the ice sets in.


137
00:09:44.155 --> 00:09:46.156
Those ships never come back.

138
00:09:46.324 --> 00:09:50.786
We're Vikings. It's an occupational
hazard. Now who's with me?!


139
00:09:50.954 --> 00:09:51.954
Count me out.

140
00:09:52.121 --> 00:09:54.206
- Today's no good for me.
- I have to do my axe returns.


141
00:09:54.374 --> 00:09:57.501
All right. Those who stay
will look after Hiccup.


142
00:09:57.669 --> 00:09:59.253
- To the ships!
- I'm with you!


143
00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:00.504
That's more like it.

144
00:10:02.548 --> 00:10:03.840
I'll pack my undies.

145
00:10:04.008 --> 00:10:06.927
No, I need you to stay
and train some new recruits.


146
00:10:07.095 --> 00:10:11.515
Perfect. And, while I'm busy,
Hiccup can cover the stall.


147
00:10:11.683 --> 00:10:14.851
Molten steel, razor-sharp blades,
lots of time to himself.


148
00:10:15.019 --> 00:10:17.020
What could possibly go wrong?

149
00:10:17.188 --> 00:10:19.314
What am I going
to do with him, Gobber?


150
00:10:19.482 --> 00:10:20.816
Put him in training.

151
00:10:20.984 --> 00:10:23.193
- No, I'm serious.
- So am I.


152
00:10:23.361 --> 00:10:26.196
He'd be killed before
the first dragon is out of its cage.


153
00:10:26.364 --> 00:10:27.948
- You don't know that.
- I do, actually.


154
00:10:28.116 --> 00:10:29.574
- No, you don't.
- No, I do.


155
00:10:29.742 --> 00:10:30.951
No, you don't.

156
00:10:31.119 --> 00:10:32.869
Listen, you know what he's like.

157
00:10:33.037 --> 00:10:36.999
From the time he could crawl,
he's been... different.


158
00:10:37.792 --> 00:10:41.670
He doesn't listen. He has
the attention span of a sparrow.


159
00:10:42.297 --> 00:10:45.340
I take him fishing
and he goes hunting for trolls!


160
00:10:45.508 --> 00:10:48.051
Trolls exist. They steal your socks.

161
00:10:48.219 --> 00:10:51.221
But only the left ones.
What's with that?


162
00:10:51.389 --> 00:10:52.639
- When I was a boy...
- Here we go.


163
00:10:52.807 --> 00:10:55.684
...my father told me to bang
my head against a rock and I did it.


164
00:10:55.852 --> 00:10:58.645
I thought it was crazy,
but I didn't question him.


165
00:10:58.813 --> 00:11:00.981
- And you know what happened?
- You got a headache.


166
00:11:01.149 --> 00:11:03.108
That rock split in two.

167
00:11:03.735 --> 00:11:06.361
It taught me what
a Viking could do, Gobber.


168
00:11:06.529 --> 00:11:10.532
He could crush mountains,
level forests, tame seas!


169
00:11:11.534 --> 00:11:15.746
Even as a boy, I knew what I was,
what I had to become.


170
00:11:16.456 --> 00:11:18.415
Hiccup is not that boy.

171
00:11:18.583 --> 00:11:20.876
You can't stop him, Stoick.

172
00:11:21.044 --> 00:11:23.211
You can only prepare him.

173
00:11:23.379 --> 00:11:27.591
I know it seems hopeless, but you won't
always be around to protect him.


174
00:11:27.759 --> 00:11:31.845
He's going to get out there again.
He's probably out there now.


175
00:11:50.114 --> 00:11:52.282
Oh, the gods hate me.

176
00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:55.619
Some people lose their knife
or their mug. Not me.


177
00:11:55.787 --> 00:11:58.789
I manage to lose an entire dragon.

178
00:12:48.005 --> 00:12:50.298
Oh, wow. I did it.

179
00:12:50.758 --> 00:12:54.386
I did it. This fixes everything! Yes!

180
00:12:54.554 --> 00:12:56.888
I have brought down
this mighty beast!


181
00:13:25.293 --> 00:13:27.294
I'm going to kill you, dragon.

182
00:13:27.753 --> 00:13:31.715
Then I'll cut out your heart
and take it to my father.


183
00:13:32.049 --> 00:13:35.177
I am a Viking. 
I am a Viking!

184
00:14:09.378 --> 00:14:11.296
I did this.

185
00:15:25.621 --> 00:15:26.621
Hiccup.

186
00:15:27.123 --> 00:15:28.498
Dad...

187
00:15:29.125 --> 00:15:31.167
...I have to talk to you, Dad.

188
00:15:31.335 --> 00:15:33.503
I need to speak with you, too, son.

189
00:15:35.131 --> 00:15:37.382
- I don't want to fight dragons.
- It's time you learn to fight dragons.


190
00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:38.550
- What?
- What?


191
00:15:38.718 --> 00:15:41.428
- You go first.
- No, you go first.


192
00:15:41.596 --> 00:15:42.679
All right.

193
00:15:43.264 --> 00:15:47.183
You get your wish. Dragon training...
you start in the morning.


194
00:15:47.351 --> 00:15:49.352
Oh, man, I should have gone first.

195
00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:51.271
I was thinking, you know,

196
00:15:51.439 --> 00:15:54.441
we have a surplus
of dragon-fighting Vikings,


197
00:15:54.609 --> 00:15:59.195
but do we have enough bread-making
Vikings or small-home-repair Vikings?


198
00:15:59.363 --> 00:16:00.363
You'll need this.

199
00:16:00.531 --> 00:16:02.741
I don't want to fight dragons.

200
00:16:03.242 --> 00:16:04.326
Come on. Yes, you do.

201
00:16:04.493 --> 00:16:08.371
Rephrase. Dad, 
I can't kill dragons.

202
00:16:08.539 --> 00:16:10.332
But you will kill dragons.

203
00:16:10.499 --> 00:16:13.501
No, I'm really very extra-sure
that I won't.


204
00:16:13.669 --> 00:16:15.545
- It's time, Hiccup.
- Can you not hear me?


205
00:16:15.713 --> 00:16:17.881
This is serious, son.

206
00:16:18.549 --> 00:16:23.303
When you carry this axe,
you carry all of us with you.


207
00:16:23.471 --> 00:16:27.140
Which means you walk like us,
you talk like us...


208
00:16:27.308 --> 00:16:29.184
...you think like us.

209
00:16:29.435 --> 00:16:31.519
No more of... this.

210
00:16:31.687 --> 00:16:33.647
You just gestured to all of me.

211
00:16:34.065 --> 00:16:37.108
- Deal?
- This conversation is very one-sided.


212
00:16:37.276 --> 00:16:38.568
Deal?

213
00:16:40.446 --> 00:16:41.571
Deal.

214
00:16:43.199 --> 00:16:44.199
Good.

215
00:16:45.576 --> 00:16:47.077
Train hard.

216
00:16:47.453 --> 00:16:49.746
I'll be back. Probably.

217
00:16:50.456 --> 00:16:52.457
And I'll be here.

218
00:16:52.792 --> 00:16:54.250
Maybe.

219
00:16:56.128 --> 00:16:57.754
Welcome to dragon training!

220
00:16:58.673 --> 00:17:00.340
No turning back.

221
00:17:17.733 --> 00:17:19.609
I hope I get some serious burns.

222
00:17:19.777 --> 00:17:23.363
I'm hoping for some mauling,
like on my shoulder or back.


223
00:17:23.531 --> 00:17:25.782
Yeah, it's only fun if you get
a scar out of it.


224
00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:27.200
Yeah, no kidding, right?

225
00:17:27.618 --> 00:17:29.369
Pain. Love it.

226
00:17:29.537 --> 00:17:31.246
Oh, great. Who let him in?

227
00:17:31.414 --> 00:17:34.124
Let's get started!
The recruit who does best


228
00:17:34.291 --> 00:17:36.918
will win the honor
of killing his first dragon


229
00:17:37.086 --> 00:17:38.795
in front of the entire village.

230
00:17:38.963 --> 00:17:43.466
Hiccup already killed a Night Fury,
so does that disqualify him?


231
00:17:43.634 --> 00:17:46.136
Can I transfer to the class
with the cool Vikings?


232
00:17:46.303 --> 00:17:50.306
Don't worry. You're small and weak...
that'll make you less of a target.


233
00:17:50.474 --> 00:17:52.225
They'll see you as sick or insane

234
00:17:52.393 --> 00:17:55.562
and go after the more
Viking-like teens instead.


235
00:17:55.730 --> 00:17:59.274
Behind these doors
are just a few of the many species


236
00:17:59.442 --> 00:18:00.442
you will learn to fight!

237
00:18:00.609 --> 00:18:03.111
- The Deadly Nadder!
- Speed 8, armor 16.


238
00:18:03.279 --> 00:18:04.612
The Hideous Zippleback.

239
00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:06.156
Plus 11 stealth. Times 2.

240
00:18:06.323 --> 00:18:08.324
- The Monstrous Nightmare.
- Firepower 15.


241
00:18:08.492 --> 00:18:10.493
- The Terrible Terror.
- Attack 8, venom 12.


242
00:18:10.661 --> 00:18:12.370
Can you stop that?!

243
00:18:12.538 --> 00:18:15.415
And the Gronckle.

244
00:18:15.583 --> 00:18:17.667
Jaw strength 8.

245
00:18:17.835 --> 00:18:19.335
Wait, aren't you gonna teach us first?

246
00:18:19.503 --> 00:18:22.005
I believe in learning on the job.

247
00:18:23.758 --> 00:18:26.843
Today is about survival.
If you get blasted...


248
00:18:27.636 --> 00:18:29.137
...you're dead!

249
00:18:29.305 --> 00:18:30.930
What's the first thing you'll need?

250
00:18:31.098 --> 00:18:32.849
- A doctor?
- Plus 5 speed?


251
00:18:33.184 --> 00:18:35.226
- A shield.
- Shields. Go!


252
00:18:35.895 --> 00:18:38.688
Your most important piece of equipment
is your shield!


253
00:18:38.856 --> 00:18:42.859
If you must choose between
a sword or a shield, take the shield!


254
00:18:43.235 --> 00:18:45.028
- Let go of my shield!
- There are a million shields!


255
00:18:45.196 --> 00:18:47.238
Take that one. It has a flower...
girls like flowers.


256
00:18:47.948 --> 00:18:49.574
Oops, this one has blood on it.

257
00:18:51.702 --> 00:18:53.661
- Tuffnut, Ruffnut! You're out!
- What?


258
00:18:53.829 --> 00:18:55.497
Shields are good for another thing.

259
00:18:55.664 --> 00:18:59.918
Noise! Make lots of it
to throw off a dragon's aim!


260
00:19:01.253 --> 00:19:03.713
All dragons have
a limited number of shots.


261
00:19:03.881 --> 00:19:06.090
How many does a Gronckle have?

262
00:19:06.258 --> 00:19:07.550
- Five?
- No, six!


263
00:19:07.718 --> 00:19:09.886
Correct, six!
That's one for each of you!


264
00:19:10.471 --> 00:19:12.388
Fishlegs, out!

265
00:19:12.556 --> 00:19:14.599
Hiccup, get in there!

266
00:19:17.228 --> 00:19:20.897
I moved into my parents' basement.
Come by sometime and work out.


267
00:19:21.273 --> 00:19:22.690
You look like you work out.

268
00:19:22.858 --> 00:19:24.734
Snotlout! You're done!

269
00:19:24.902 --> 00:19:26.569
So it's just you and me, huh?

270
00:19:26.737 --> 00:19:28.363
Nope, just you.

271
00:19:29.365 --> 00:19:31.241
One shot left!

272
00:19:32.535 --> 00:19:33.618
Hiccup!

273
00:19:41.752 --> 00:19:43.628
And that's six.

274
00:19:43.921 --> 00:19:46.840
Go back to bed,
you overgrown sausage!


275
00:19:48.759 --> 00:19:51.553
You'll get another chance,
don't you worry.


276
00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:54.722
Remember, a dragon will always,

277
00:19:54.974 --> 00:19:58.434
always go for the kill.

278
00:20:05.234 --> 00:20:07.652
So... why didn't you?

279
00:20:34.889 --> 00:20:36.681
This was stupid.

280
00:21:19.975 --> 00:21:22.894
Why don't you just fly away?

281
00:21:59.056 --> 00:22:01.724
All right, where did Astrid go wrong
in the ring today?


282
00:22:01.892 --> 00:22:04.644
I mistimed my somersault dive.
It was sloppy.


283
00:22:04.812 --> 00:22:07.397
- It threw off my reverse tumble.
- Yeah, we noticed.


284
00:22:07.564 --> 00:22:09.565
No, no, you were great.
That was so "Astrid."


285
00:22:09.733 --> 00:22:12.276
She's right. You have to be
tough on yourselves.


286
00:22:12.444 --> 00:22:14.195
Where did Hiccup go wrong?

287
00:22:14.363 --> 00:22:16.864
- He showed up.
- He didn't get eaten.


288
00:22:17.032 --> 00:22:18.741
He's never where he should be.

289
00:22:18.909 --> 00:22:20.827
Thank you, Astrid.

290
00:22:21.078 --> 00:22:25.581
You need to live and breathe
this stuff. The dragon manual.


291
00:22:26.417 --> 00:22:29.961
Everything we know about
every dragon we know of.


292
00:22:32.589 --> 00:22:34.549
No attacks tonight. Study up.

293
00:22:34.717 --> 00:22:36.342
Wait, you mean read?

294
00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:37.760
While we're still alive?

295
00:22:37.928 --> 00:22:39.846
Why read words
when you can just kill the stuff


296
00:22:40.014 --> 00:22:41.681
the words tell you stuff about?

297
00:22:41.849 --> 00:22:44.767
I've read it seven times.
There's this water dragon


298
00:22:44.935 --> 00:22:48.229
that sprays boiling water at your
face. And there's this other one...


299
00:22:48.647 --> 00:22:50.064
Yeah. That sounds great.

300
00:22:50.232 --> 00:22:53.443
- There was a chance I'd read it...
- But now...


301
00:22:53.610 --> 00:22:55.194
You guys read. 
I'll go kill stuff.

302
00:22:55.612 --> 00:22:58.489
Another one has spines like trees.

303
00:22:58.657 --> 00:23:00.825
- So I guess we'll share?
- Read it.


304
00:23:01.118 --> 00:23:05.788
All mine, then. Wow.
So, OK, I'll see you...


305
00:23:06.123 --> 00:23:07.582
...tomorrow.

306
00:23:17.676 --> 00:23:19.552
Dragon classifications.

307
00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:22.972
Strike class.
Fear class. Mystery class.


308
00:23:23.849 --> 00:23:28.644
Thunderdrum. This reclusive dragon
inhabits sea caves and dark tide pools.


309
00:23:28.812 --> 00:23:31.814
When startled, the Thunderdrum
produces a concussive sound


310
00:23:31.982 --> 00:23:33.733
that can kill a man at close range.

311
00:23:33.901 --> 00:23:36.819
Extremely dangerous. 
Kill on sight.

312
00:23:36.987 --> 00:23:40.823
Timberjack. This gigantic creature
has razor-sharp wings


313
00:23:40.991 --> 00:23:42.950
that can slice through full-grown trees.

314
00:23:43.118 --> 00:23:46.120
Extremely dangerous. 
Kill on sight.

315
00:23:46.288 --> 00:23:51.125
Scauldron. Sprays scalding water
at its victim. Extremely dangerous.


316
00:23:57.049 --> 00:24:01.219
Changewing. Even newly hatched
dragons can spray acid. Kill on sight.


317
00:24:01.512 --> 00:24:05.056
Gronckle. Zippleback. The Skrill.

318
00:24:05.516 --> 00:24:08.684
Bone Knapper. Whispering Death.

319
00:24:09.978 --> 00:24:11.854
Burns its victims. 
Buries its victims.

320
00:24:12.022 --> 00:24:14.982
Chokes its victims.
Turns its victims inside out.


321
00:24:15.234 --> 00:24:17.985
Extremely dangerous.
Extremely dangerous.


322
00:24:18.237 --> 00:24:21.864
Kill on sight.
Kill on sight. Kill on sight.


323
00:24:23.659 --> 00:24:25.034
Night Fury.

324
00:24:25.702 --> 00:24:29.247
Speed unknown. Size unknown.

325
00:24:29.706 --> 00:24:33.876
The unholy offspring
of lightning and death itself.


326
00:24:34.044 --> 00:24:35.837
Never engage this dragon.

327
00:24:36.004 --> 00:24:40.174
Your only chance: Hide and pray
it does not find you.


328
00:24:54.106 --> 00:24:56.065
I can almost smell them.

329
00:24:56.233 --> 00:24:57.859
They're close.

330
00:24:58.902 --> 00:25:00.319
Steady.

331
00:25:11.081 --> 00:25:12.331
Take us in.

332
00:25:12.499 --> 00:25:15.251
Hard to port. For Helheim's Gate.

333
00:25:15.586 --> 00:25:17.253
Hard to port!

334
00:25:21.091 --> 00:25:22.758
Steady!

335
00:25:35.063 --> 00:25:39.275
Hey, you know, I just happened to notice
the book had nothing on Night Furies.


336
00:25:39.568 --> 00:25:44.113
Is there another book, or a sequel?
Maybe a Night Fury pamphlet?


337
00:25:45.490 --> 00:25:48.492
Focus, Hiccup!
You're not even trying!


338
00:25:50.245 --> 00:25:53.372
Today it's all about attack!

339
00:25:53.832 --> 00:25:56.250
Nadders are quick and light
on their feet.


340
00:25:56.418 --> 00:25:59.128
Your job is to be quicker and lighter!

341
00:26:01.423 --> 00:26:04.133
I'm really beginning to question
your teaching methods!


342
00:26:04.301 --> 00:26:06.761
Look for its blind spot!
Every dragon has one.


343
00:26:06.929 --> 00:26:09.847
Find it, hide in it and strike!

344
00:26:11.391 --> 00:26:12.767
Do you ever bathe?

345
00:26:12.935 --> 00:26:15.519
If you don't like it, then
just get your own blind spot.


346
00:26:15.687 --> 00:26:17.647
How about I give you one?

347
00:26:19.316 --> 00:26:22.235
Blind spot, yes.
Deaf spot, not so much.


348
00:26:23.237 --> 00:26:26.113
Hey, so, how would one sneak up
on a Night Fury?


349
00:26:26.281 --> 00:26:29.784
No one's ever met one and lived
to tell the tale. Get in there!


350
00:26:29.952 --> 00:26:32.286
- I know, I know, but hypothetically...
- Hiccup!


351
00:26:32.454 --> 00:26:33.788
Get down.

352
00:26:47.928 --> 00:26:49.929
Watch out, babe.
I'll take care of this.


353
00:26:51.098 --> 00:26:53.933
The sun was in my eyes, Astrid.

354
00:26:54.226 --> 00:26:56.060
What do you want me to do,
block out the sun?


355
00:26:56.228 --> 00:26:58.145
I could do that
but I don't have time!

356
00:26:58.313 --> 00:27:00.106
They probably...

357
00:27:00.274 --> 00:27:04.068
...take the daytime off, right?
Like a cat.


358
00:27:04.236 --> 00:27:06.362
Has anyone ever seen one napping?

359
00:27:06.863 --> 00:27:10.700
Hiccup!

360
00:27:13.412 --> 00:27:15.705
Love on the battlefield.

361
00:27:15.872 --> 00:27:16.914
She could do better.

362
00:27:17.082 --> 00:27:18.708
Let me... Why don't you?

363
00:27:28.176 --> 00:27:29.510
Well done, Astrid.

364
00:27:31.513 --> 00:27:34.223
Is this some kind
of a joke to you?

365
00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:37.476
Our parents' war
is about to become ours.


366
00:27:37.644 --> 00:27:39.854
Figure out which side you're on.

367
00:29:01.311 --> 00:29:03.145
Toothless.

368
00:29:03.313 --> 00:29:05.523
I could have sworn you had...

369
00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:09.860
...teeth.

370
00:29:14.074 --> 00:29:15.116
No, no, no.

371
00:29:17.035 --> 00:29:18.494
I don't have any more!

372
00:33:15.148 --> 00:33:19.276
And with one twist, he took my hand
and swallowed it whole!


373
00:33:19.444 --> 00:33:22.571
I saw the look on his face...
I was delicious.


374
00:33:22.739 --> 00:33:24.031
He must have passed the word,

375
00:33:24.199 --> 00:33:27.743
because it wasn't a month before
another one of them took my leg.


376
00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:31.580
Isn't it weird to think
your hand was inside a dragon?


377
00:33:31.748 --> 00:33:33.957
Like if your mind was still
in control of it,


378
00:33:34.125 --> 00:33:37.670
you could have killed the dragon
from inside by crushing his heart.


379
00:33:37.837 --> 00:33:42.591
I swear, I'm so angry. I'll avenge your
beautiful hand and your beautiful foot.


380
00:33:42.759 --> 00:33:46.762
I'll chop off the legs of every dragon
I fight, with my face.


381
00:33:48.264 --> 00:33:50.432
It's the wings and the tails
you really want.


382
00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:53.060
If it can't fly, it can't get away.

383
00:33:53.228 --> 00:33:56.522
A downed dragon is a dead dragon.

384
00:33:59.651 --> 00:34:02.361
All right, I'm off to bed.
You should be, too.


385
00:34:02.529 --> 00:34:05.781
Tomorrow we get to the big boys,
slowly but surely


386
00:34:05.949 --> 00:34:09.159
making our way up
to the Monstrous Nightmare.


387
00:34:09.327 --> 00:34:11.829
But who'll win the honor of killing it?

388
00:34:11.996 --> 00:34:15.249
It's gonna be me. 
It's my destiny. See?

389
00:34:15.417 --> 00:34:17.501
Your mom let you get a tattoo?

390
00:34:17.669 --> 00:34:19.378
It's not a tattoo, it's a birthmark.

391
00:34:19.546 --> 00:34:23.298
OK, I've been stuck with you since
birth, and that was never there before.


392
00:34:23.466 --> 00:34:26.301
Yes, it was. You've just never
seen me from the left side.


393
00:35:06.801 --> 00:35:09.511
Hey, Toothless.

394
00:35:09.679 --> 00:35:13.515
I brought breakfast. I hope...
I hope you're hungry.


395
00:35:14.642 --> 00:35:16.643
OK, that's disgusting.

396
00:35:16.895 --> 00:35:20.564
We've got some salmon,
some nice Icelandic cod...


397
00:35:20.732 --> 00:35:22.900
...and a whole smoked eel.

398
00:35:28.281 --> 00:35:31.241
No, no, no, no, no!
No, it's OK.


399
00:35:31.785 --> 00:35:33.994
Yeah, I don't really like
eel much, either.


400
00:35:37.624 --> 00:35:38.916
That's it.

401
00:35:39.667 --> 00:35:41.794
That's it.
Just stick with the good stuff.


402
00:35:42.253 --> 00:35:45.923
And don't you mind me.
I'll just be back here,


403
00:35:46.382 --> 00:35:48.926
minding my own business.

404
00:36:01.397 --> 00:36:02.689
It's OK.

405
00:36:12.826 --> 00:36:14.034
OK.

406
00:36:28.424 --> 00:36:29.758
That's not too bad. It works.

407
00:36:35.306 --> 00:36:37.307
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

408
00:36:47.861 --> 00:36:49.862
Oh, my! It's working!

409
00:36:56.077 --> 00:36:57.953
Yes, yes! I did it!

410
00:37:10.216 --> 00:37:11.216
Yeah!

411
00:37:11.384 --> 00:37:13.343
Today is about teamwork.

412
00:37:15.930 --> 00:37:19.558
Now, a wet dragon head
can't light its fire.


413
00:37:19.809 --> 00:37:23.687
The Hideous Zippleback
is extra tricky.


414
00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:27.316
One head breathes gas,
the other head lights it.


415
00:37:28.484 --> 00:37:31.278
Your job is to know which is which.

416
00:37:31.446 --> 00:37:34.615
Razor-sharp serrated teeth
that inject venom for pre-digestion.


417
00:37:34.782 --> 00:37:37.117
Prefers ambush attack,
crushing its victims...


418
00:37:37.285 --> 00:37:38.577
Will you please stop that?!

419
00:37:42.832 --> 00:37:46.668
If that dragon shows
either of his faces, I'm gonna...


420
00:37:46.836 --> 00:37:48.045
There!

421
00:37:49.005 --> 00:37:51.548
Hey, it's us, idiots!

422
00:37:51.716 --> 00:37:54.468
Your butts are getting bigger.
We thought you were a dragon.


423
00:37:54.677 --> 00:37:58.013
Not that there's anything wrong
with a dragonesque figure.


424
00:38:01.726 --> 00:38:02.726
Wait.

425
00:38:05.730 --> 00:38:07.981
Oh, I'm hurt! I am very much hurt!

426
00:38:08.149 --> 00:38:11.026
Chances of survival are
dwindling to single digits now.


427
00:38:18.618 --> 00:38:20.035
Wrong head.

428
00:38:20.662 --> 00:38:21.662
Fishlegs!

429
00:38:24.874 --> 00:38:25.874
Now, Hiccup!

430
00:38:28.878 --> 00:38:30.754
Oh, come on.

431
00:38:35.426 --> 00:38:36.760
Hiccup!

432
00:38:38.513 --> 00:38:41.056
Back, back, back!

433
00:38:41.683 --> 00:38:45.852
Now, don't you make me tell you again!
Yes, that's right.


434
00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:49.856
Back into your cage.
Now think about what you've done.


435
00:38:59.867 --> 00:39:04.913
OK, so are we done? 'Cause I've got
some things I need to...


436
00:39:05.540 --> 00:39:07.791
Yep, I'll see you tomorrow!

437
00:39:59.927 --> 00:40:01.845
I've never seen a Gronckle do that.

438
00:40:02.013 --> 00:40:06.892
I left my axe back in the ring. You guys
go on ahead. I'll catch up with you.


439
00:40:46.682 --> 00:40:49.059
Meet the Terrible Terror.

440
00:40:51.312 --> 00:40:52.521
It's like the size of my...

441
00:40:53.898 --> 00:40:55.065
Get it off!

442
00:40:55.650 --> 00:40:58.568
Oh, I'm hurt! I am very much hurt!

443
00:41:01.364 --> 00:41:03.657
Wow! He's better than you ever were.

444
00:41:48.327 --> 00:41:49.911
Oh, great.

445
00:41:50.955 --> 00:41:52.038
Hiccup.

446
00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:09.514
Hiccup? Are you in there?

447
00:42:11.267 --> 00:42:12.642
Astrid. Hey.

448
00:42:12.810 --> 00:42:15.395
Hi, Astrid. Hi, Astrid. Hi, Astrid.

449
00:42:15.563 --> 00:42:18.481
I normally don't care what people do,
but you're acting weird.


450
00:42:20.109 --> 00:42:21.359
Well, weirder.

451
00:42:50.014 --> 00:42:53.725
- I trust you found the nest, at least?
- Not even close.


452
00:42:53.893 --> 00:42:54.893
Excellent.

453
00:42:55.061 --> 00:42:57.270
I hope you had more success than me.

454
00:42:57.438 --> 00:43:01.775
Well, if by success, you mean that
your parenting troubles are over, yes.


455
00:43:01.984 --> 00:43:05.278
Congratulations, Stoick!
Everyone is so relieved!


456
00:43:05.446 --> 00:43:07.572
Out with the old and
in with the new, right?


457
00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:11.117
- No one will miss that nuisance!
- We're throwing a party to celebrate!


458
00:43:11.661 --> 00:43:12.827
- Come over here.
- Hurry!


459
00:43:12.995 --> 00:43:13.995
He's gone?

460
00:43:16.165 --> 00:43:20.085
Most afternoons, but who can blame
him? The life of a celebrity's rough.


461
00:43:20.253 --> 00:43:24.005
He can barely walk through the village
without being swarmed by his new fans.


462
00:43:24.173 --> 00:43:25.173
Hiccup?

463
00:43:25.341 --> 00:43:29.469
Who would have thought it?
He has this way with the beasts.


464
00:43:37.687 --> 00:43:41.314
OK, bud.
We're gonna take this nice and slow.


465
00:43:41.482 --> 00:43:43.233
Here we go. Here we go. Position...

466
00:43:43.901 --> 00:43:45.902
...three... no, four.

467
00:44:05.172 --> 00:44:07.799
All right, it's go time. It's go time.

468
00:44:13.889 --> 00:44:15.807
Come on, buddy! 
Come on, buddy!

469
00:44:23.816 --> 00:44:25.400
Yes, it worked!

470
00:44:30.072 --> 00:44:31.364
Sorry!

471
00:44:33.826 --> 00:44:35.035
It was my fault.

472
00:44:36.245 --> 00:44:38.371
Yeah, yeah, I'm on it. 
Position four.

473
00:44:38.873 --> 00:44:39.873
Three.

474
00:44:43.085 --> 00:44:45.086
Yeah! Go, baby!

475
00:44:45.838 --> 00:44:46.838
Yes!

476
00:44:47.006 --> 00:44:51.176
Oh, this is amazing!
The wind in my... cheat sheet!


477
00:44:51.344 --> 00:44:52.844
Stop!

478
00:44:55.556 --> 00:44:56.848
No!

479
00:44:59.935 --> 00:45:03.313
Oh, gosh! Oh, gods! Oh, no!

480
00:45:03.731 --> 00:45:06.858
All right, OK, you've gotta
kind of angle yourself.


481
00:45:07.026 --> 00:45:09.819
OK, no, no, no. Come back down
towards me! Come back down...


482
00:45:51.654 --> 00:45:53.279
Yeah!

483
00:45:55.116 --> 00:45:56.199
Come on.

484
00:46:05.251 --> 00:46:07.168
No, thanks. I'm good.

485
00:46:44.206 --> 00:46:47.333
Not so fireproof
on the inside, are you?


486
00:46:47.501 --> 00:46:48.626
Here you go.

487
00:47:05.186 --> 00:47:09.314
Everything we know
about you guys is wrong.


488
00:47:19.533 --> 00:47:22.494
Dad! You're back!
Gobber's not here so...


489
00:47:22.661 --> 00:47:23.661
I know.

490
00:47:26.248 --> 00:47:29.083
- I came looking for you.
- You did?


491
00:47:29.251 --> 00:47:30.752
You've been keeping secrets.

492
00:47:31.086 --> 00:47:32.462
I have?

493
00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:35.256
Just how long did you think
you could hide it?


494
00:47:35.424 --> 00:47:38.092
I don't know what you're...

495
00:47:38.260 --> 00:47:42.680
Nothing happens on this island
without me hearing about it.


496
00:47:43.474 --> 00:47:44.766
So...

497
00:47:45.476 --> 00:47:47.393
...let's talk...

498
00:47:47.561 --> 00:47:49.437
...about that dragon.

499
00:47:49.605 --> 00:47:53.775
Oh, gods. Dad, I'm so sorry.
I was going to tell you.


500
00:47:54.109 --> 00:47:56.361
I just didn't know how to...

501
00:48:01.158 --> 00:48:03.284
You're not upset?

502
00:48:03.452 --> 00:48:06.079
What?! I was hoping for this!

503
00:48:06.956 --> 00:48:09.624
- You were?
- And believe me, it only gets better!


504
00:48:09.792 --> 00:48:12.544
Wait till you spill
a Nadder's guts the first time!


505
00:48:12.711 --> 00:48:15.421
And mount your first
Gronckle head on a spear!


506
00:48:15.589 --> 00:48:19.384
What a feeling!
You really had me going there, son!


507
00:48:19.552 --> 00:48:23.721
All those years of the worst Viking
Berk has ever seen.


508
00:48:23.889 --> 00:48:27.183
Odin, it was rough.
I almost gave up on you.


509
00:48:27.351 --> 00:48:29.602
And all the while
you were holding out on me!


510
00:48:29.770 --> 00:48:31.646
Oh, Thor Almighty!

511
00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:35.817
With you doing so well in the ring...

512
00:48:37.152 --> 00:48:39.821
...we finally have something
to talk about.


513
00:48:53.544 --> 00:48:57.171
Here, I brought you something,

514
00:48:57.423 --> 00:49:00.133
to keep you safe in the ring.

515
00:49:00.301 --> 00:49:02.385
Wow. Thanks.

516
00:49:02.553 --> 00:49:07.432
Your mother would have wanted you to
have it. It's half of her breastplate.


517
00:49:09.018 --> 00:49:12.854
Matching set.
It keeps her close, you know.


518
00:49:13.564 --> 00:49:18.568
Wear it proudly. You deserve it.
You've held up your end of the deal.


519
00:49:24.199 --> 00:49:28.536
- I should really get to bed.
- Yes, good. OK, good talk.


520
00:49:28.704 --> 00:49:31.122
- I'll see you back at the house. Great.
- We should do this again.


521
00:49:31.290 --> 00:49:32.498
Thanks for stopping by...

522
00:49:32.666 --> 00:49:35.710
...and for the breast hat.
- I hope you like the hat.


523
00:49:37.713 --> 00:49:39.589
Well... Yep. Good night.

524
00:49:54.563 --> 00:49:57.565
Stay out of my way!
I'm winning this thing.


525
00:49:57.733 --> 00:50:00.443
Please, by all means.

526
00:50:12.498 --> 00:50:14.582
This time, this time for sure!

527
00:50:23.425 --> 00:50:26.177
No! No, son of a half-troll,

528
00:50:26.345 --> 00:50:29.347
- rat-eating, munge-bucket!
- Wait, wait.


529
00:50:29.515 --> 00:50:31.349
- So, later.
- Not so fast.


530
00:50:31.517 --> 00:50:33.476
- I'm kind of late for...
- What?!


531
00:50:33.644 --> 00:50:36.187
Late for what, exactly?

532
00:50:36.355 --> 00:50:39.190
Quiet down! The elder has decided.

533
00:50:50.619 --> 00:50:54.872
You've done it, Hiccup!
You get to kill the dragon!


534
00:50:58.168 --> 00:50:59.335
That's my boy!

535
00:50:59.503 --> 00:51:03.214
Yeah. Yes. I can't wait. I am so...

536
00:51:03.382 --> 00:51:05.299
...leaving! We're leaving.

537
00:51:05.467 --> 00:51:09.929
Let's pack up. Looks like you and me
are taking a little vacation.


538
00:51:10.389 --> 00:51:11.639
Forever.

539
00:51:14.393 --> 00:51:15.935
Oh, man.

540
00:51:17.896 --> 00:51:20.982
What the?!
What are you doing here?


541
00:51:21.817 --> 00:51:24.235
I want to know what's going on.

542
00:51:24.403 --> 00:51:28.489
No one just gets as good as you do.
Especially you.


543
00:51:28.657 --> 00:51:31.492
Start talking!
Are you training with someone?


544
00:51:31.660 --> 00:51:32.702
Training?

545
00:51:32.870 --> 00:51:34.495
It better not involve this.

546
00:51:34.663 --> 00:51:38.291
I know this looks really bad,
but you see...


547
00:51:40.669 --> 00:51:42.670
You're right. You're right.
You're right.


548
00:51:42.838 --> 00:51:47.967
I'm through with the lies.
I've been making outfits. So you got me.


549
00:51:48.302 --> 00:51:52.263
It's time everyone knew.
Drag me back, go ahead. Here we go.


550
00:51:52.848 --> 00:51:54.390
Why would you do that?!

551
00:51:54.558 --> 00:51:58.978
That's for the lies.
And that's for everything else.


552
00:51:59.772 --> 00:52:00.772
Oh, man.

553
00:52:02.232 --> 00:52:03.232
Get down!

554
00:52:05.194 --> 00:52:06.569
Run, run!

555
00:52:09.198 --> 00:52:10.990
It's OK! It's OK.

556
00:52:11.325 --> 00:52:12.700
She's a friend.

557
00:52:14.870 --> 00:52:16.204
You just scared him.

558
00:52:16.371 --> 00:52:17.872
I scared him?!

559
00:52:18.874 --> 00:52:20.500
Who is "him"?

560
00:52:21.585 --> 00:52:25.588
Astrid, Toothless. Toothless, Astrid.

561
00:52:31.720 --> 00:52:32.887
We're dead.

562
00:52:33.889 --> 00:52:36.015
Where do you think you're going?

563
00:52:42.147 --> 00:52:45.024
Oh, great Odin's ghost! This is it!

564
00:52:55.911 --> 00:52:58.246
Hiccup, get me down from here!

565
00:52:58.413 --> 00:53:00.581
You have to give
me a chance to explain.

566
00:53:00.749 --> 00:53:03.417
I am not listening
to anything you have to say!


567
00:53:03.585 --> 00:53:07.046
Then I won't speak.
Just let me show you.


568
00:53:08.590 --> 00:53:09.966
Please, Astrid.

569
00:53:25.941 --> 00:53:27.024
Now get me down.

570
00:53:27.192 --> 00:53:29.944
Toothless, down. Gently.

571
00:53:31.738 --> 00:53:34.448
See? Nothing to be afraid of.

572
00:53:37.870 --> 00:53:39.328
Toothless!

573
00:53:40.330 --> 00:53:43.332
What is wrong with you?! Bad dragon!

574
00:53:44.459 --> 00:53:47.336
He's not usually like this.
Oh, no.


575
00:53:52.885 --> 00:53:56.012
Toothless, what are you doing?
We need her to like us!


576
00:53:59.016 --> 00:54:01.017
And now the spinning.

577
00:54:01.894 --> 00:54:05.062
Thank you for nothing,
you useless reptile.


578
00:54:05.814 --> 00:54:08.816
OK, I am sorry! I'm sorry.

579
00:54:09.109 --> 00:54:10.818
Just get me off of this thing.

580
00:55:57.509 --> 00:56:01.220
All right, I admit it.
This is pretty cool.


581
00:56:01.555 --> 00:56:04.098
It's amazing.

582
00:56:04.433 --> 00:56:05.975
He's amazing.

583
00:56:08.645 --> 00:56:10.771
So what now?

584
00:56:10.939 --> 00:56:13.774
Hiccup, your final exam is tomorrow.

585
00:56:14.067 --> 00:56:16.068
You know you'll have to kill...

586
00:56:16.653 --> 00:56:17.778
...kill a dragon.

587
00:56:17.946 --> 00:56:19.655
Don't remind me.

588
00:56:20.782 --> 00:56:22.199
Toothless, what's happening?

589
00:56:24.661 --> 00:56:26.078
What is it?

590
00:56:28.874 --> 00:56:29.957
Get down!

591
00:56:47.225 --> 00:56:48.976
- What's going on?
- I don't know.


592
00:56:49.144 --> 00:56:52.146
Toothless, you gotta get us
out of here, bud.


593
00:56:54.691 --> 00:56:57.109
It looks like
they're hauling in their kill.


594
00:56:58.070 --> 00:56:59.820
What does that make us?

595
00:57:42.739 --> 00:57:45.241
What my dad wouldn't give
to find this.


596
00:58:02.175 --> 00:58:05.636
It's satisfying to know that all of
our food has been dumped down a hole.


597
00:58:06.304 --> 00:58:08.639
They're not eating any of it.

598
00:58:24.114 --> 00:58:25.739
What is that?

599
00:58:32.873 --> 00:58:35.875
All right, bud,
we got to get out of here... now!


600
00:58:45.260 --> 00:58:49.054
It totally makes sense.
It's like a giant beehive.


601
00:58:49.222 --> 00:58:51.223
They're the workers
and that's their queen.


602
00:58:51.391 --> 00:58:53.934
It controls them. 
Let's find your dad.

603
00:58:54.102 --> 00:58:55.352
No! No.

604
00:58:55.687 --> 00:58:59.773
No, not yet. They'll kill Toothless.

605
00:58:59.941 --> 00:59:02.651
We have to think this through
carefully.


606
00:59:02.819 --> 00:59:05.738
Hiccup, we just discovered
the dragons' nest,


607
00:59:05.906 --> 00:59:08.616
the thing we've been after
since Vikings first sailed here,


608
00:59:08.783 --> 00:59:11.076
and you want to keep it a secret?

609
00:59:11.244 --> 00:59:14.163
To protect your pet dragon?
Are you serious?


610
00:59:16.291 --> 00:59:17.499
Yes.

611
00:59:24.966 --> 00:59:27.468
OK. Then what do we do?

612
00:59:27.636 --> 00:59:31.388
Just give me until tomorrow.
I'll figure something out.


613
00:59:32.140 --> 00:59:33.307
OK.

614
00:59:34.851 --> 00:59:36.143
That's for kidnapping me.

615
00:59:43.151 --> 00:59:45.861
That's for everything else.

616
00:59:55.038 --> 00:59:57.039
What are you looking at?

617
00:59:57.791 --> 01:00:01.919
Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup!

618
01:00:04.756 --> 01:00:08.133
I can show my face in public again!

619
01:00:10.470 --> 01:00:13.555
If someone had told me
that in a few short weeks


620
01:00:13.723 --> 01:00:18.310
Hiccup would go from, well,
being Hiccup


621
01:00:18.478 --> 01:00:22.982
to placing first in dragon training,
well, I would have tied him to a mast


622
01:00:23.149 --> 01:00:25.734
and shipped him off
for fear he'd gone mad!


623
01:00:26.403 --> 01:00:27.736
And you know it!

624
01:00:30.198 --> 01:00:34.702
But here we are.
And no one is more surprised


625
01:00:34.869 --> 01:00:37.871
or more proud than I am.

626
01:00:38.373 --> 01:00:41.792
Today, my boy becomes a Viking.

627
01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:45.170
Today, he becomes one of us!

628
01:00:49.175 --> 01:00:51.051
Be careful with that dragon.

629
01:00:51.219 --> 01:00:54.638
- It's not the dragon I'm worried about.
- What are you going to do?


630
01:00:54.806 --> 01:00:57.891
Put an end to this. 
I have to try.

631
01:00:58.601 --> 01:01:02.021
Astrid, if something goes wrong,

632
01:01:02.188 --> 01:01:04.231
just make sure
they don't find Toothless.


633
01:01:04.899 --> 01:01:08.444
I will. Just promise me
it won't go wrong.


634
01:01:09.195 --> 01:01:12.448
It's time, Hiccup. 
Knock 'em dead.

635
01:01:17.996 --> 01:01:20.456
Yeah! Show 'em how it's done.

636
01:01:20.623 --> 01:01:23.876
Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup!

637
01:01:36.389 --> 01:01:37.931
I would have gone for the hammer.

638
01:01:42.062 --> 01:01:43.270
I'm ready.

639
01:02:07.295 --> 01:02:09.922
Go on, Hiccup. 
Give it to him!

640
01:02:14.344 --> 01:02:15.677
What is he doing?

641
01:02:18.473 --> 01:02:21.100
Hey, it's OK. It's OK.

642
01:02:28.983 --> 01:02:30.150
I'm not one of them.

643
01:02:35.323 --> 01:02:36.532
What's he thinking?

644
01:02:37.117 --> 01:02:38.575
- Stop the fight.
- No!


645
01:02:39.035 --> 01:02:41.453
I need you all to see this.

646
01:02:42.372 --> 01:02:44.498
They're not what we think they are.

647
01:02:45.250 --> 01:02:46.667
We don't have to kill them.

648
01:02:48.169 --> 01:02:50.379
I said, stop the fight!

649
01:02:57.929 --> 01:02:59.138
Out of my way!

650
01:02:59.389 --> 01:03:09.389
Hiccup!

651
01:03:29.252 --> 01:03:30.544
This way!

652
01:03:50.899 --> 01:03:52.149
Night Fury!

653
01:04:10.752 --> 01:04:12.544
Toothless, go. 
Get out of here.

654
01:04:14.756 --> 01:04:15.923
Go, go!

655
01:04:16.090 --> 01:04:17.090
Stoick, no!

656
01:04:17.258 --> 01:04:18.634
Dad, he won't hurt you!

657
01:04:19.636 --> 01:04:22.679
No, don't!
You're only making it worse!


658
01:04:23.806 --> 01:04:24.806
Toothless, stop!

659
01:04:26.601 --> 01:04:28.435
No! No!

660
01:04:32.065 --> 01:04:33.065
Get him!

661
01:04:36.653 --> 01:04:38.654
No, no! Please just don't hurt him!

662
01:04:39.364 --> 01:04:40.781
Please don't hurt him.

663
01:04:47.747 --> 01:04:49.248
Put it with the others.

664
01:04:52.043 --> 01:04:54.503
I should have known.
I should have seen the signs.


665
01:04:54.671 --> 01:04:56.505
- Dad?
- We had a deal!


666
01:04:56.673 --> 01:05:00.717
I know we did. That was before...
It's all so messed up.


667
01:05:00.885 --> 01:05:04.304
So everything in the ring,
a trick? A lie?


668
01:05:04.472 --> 01:05:08.600
I screwed up. I should have
told you before now. I just...


669
01:05:08.768 --> 01:05:12.312
Take this out on me, be mad at me,
but please, just don't hurt Toothless.


670
01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:15.649
The dragon?
That's what you're worried about?


671
01:05:15.817 --> 01:05:17.526
Not the people you almost killed?

672
01:05:17.694 --> 01:05:20.112
He was protecting me!
He's not dangerous.


673
01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:22.281
They've killed hundreds of us!

674
01:05:22.448 --> 01:05:24.157
And we've killed thousands of them!

675
01:05:24.325 --> 01:05:29.580
They defend themselves, that's all!
They raid us because they have to.


676
01:05:29.747 --> 01:05:33.584
If they don't bring enough food back,
they'll be eaten themselves.


677
01:05:33.751 --> 01:05:38.046
There's something else
on their island. It's a dragon like...


678
01:05:38.214 --> 01:05:40.966
Their island?
So you've been to the nest?


679
01:05:41.134 --> 01:05:42.926
- Did I say nest?
- How did you find it?


680
01:05:43.094 --> 01:05:45.637
What? No, I didn't. 
Toothless did.

681
01:05:45.805 --> 01:05:48.515
Only a dragon can find the island.

682
01:05:49.851 --> 01:05:52.978
No, no, no. No, Dad.
No, please, it's not what you think.


683
01:05:53.146 --> 01:05:56.189
You don't know what you're up against.
It's like nothing you've ever seen.


684
01:05:56.357 --> 01:06:00.277
Dad, please. I promise you,
you can't win this one!


685
01:06:00.445 --> 01:06:02.487
No, Dad. No.

686
01:06:02.655 --> 01:06:05.616
For once in your life,
would you please just listen to me?!


687
01:06:09.370 --> 01:06:13.165
You've thrown your lot in with them.
You're not a Viking.


688
01:06:15.418 --> 01:06:17.294
You're not my son.

689
01:06:20.506 --> 01:06:21.757
Ready the ships!

690
01:06:33.770 --> 01:06:34.978
This way.

691
01:07:17.313 --> 01:07:18.855
Set sail!

692
01:07:19.232 --> 01:07:21.608
We head for Helheim's Gate.

693
01:07:30.118 --> 01:07:32.452
Lead us home, devil.

694
01:07:53.349 --> 01:07:54.850
It's a mess.

695
01:07:56.185 --> 01:07:59.438
You must feel horrible.
You've lost everything:


696
01:07:59.605 --> 01:08:02.482
Your father, your tribe,
your best friend.


697
01:08:02.650 --> 01:08:04.818
Thank you for summing that up.

698
01:08:06.654 --> 01:08:10.157
Why couldn't I have killed that dragon
when I found him in the woods?


699
01:08:10.324 --> 01:08:14.619
- Would have been better for everyone.
- Yep. The rest of us would've done it.


700
01:08:15.496 --> 01:08:17.330
So why didn't you?

701
01:08:20.001 --> 01:08:22.794
- Why didn't you?
- I don't know.


702
01:08:23.755 --> 01:08:25.672
- I couldn't.
- That's not an answer.


703
01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:28.133
Why is this so important
to you all of a sudden?


704
01:08:28.301 --> 01:08:31.511
Because I want to remember
what you say right now.


705
01:08:31.679 --> 01:08:36.725
For the love of... I was a coward.
I was weak. I wouldn't kill a dragon.


706
01:08:36.893 --> 01:08:38.143
You said "wouldn't".

707
01:08:38.311 --> 01:08:40.479
Whatever! I wouldn't!

708
01:08:40.646 --> 01:08:44.524
Three hundred years and I'm the first
Viking who wouldn't kill a dragon.


709
01:08:49.030 --> 01:08:50.947
First one to ride one, though.

710
01:08:53.409 --> 01:08:54.409
So?

711
01:08:57.371 --> 01:09:00.749
I wouldn't kill him because
he looked as frightened as I was.


712
01:09:01.834 --> 01:09:05.420
I looked at him and I saw myself.

713
01:09:07.256 --> 01:09:11.927
I bet he's really frightened now.
What are you going to do about it?


714
01:09:13.387 --> 01:09:17.891
- Probably something stupid.
- Good, but you've already done that.


715
01:09:19.519 --> 01:09:21.520
Then something crazy.

716
01:09:22.396 --> 01:09:24.523
That's more like it.

717
01:09:32.990 --> 01:09:36.243
Sound your positions.
Stay within earshot.


718
01:09:36.410 --> 01:09:38.912
- Here!
- One length to your stern.


719
01:09:39.330 --> 01:09:44.292
Listen, Stoick, I was overhearing some
of the men and, well, some of them


720
01:09:44.460 --> 01:09:48.088
are wondering what it is
we're up to here. Not me, of course.


721
01:09:48.256 --> 01:09:50.757
I know you're always the man
with the plan. But some,


722
01:09:50.925 --> 01:09:54.427
not me, are wondering if there is
in fact a plan at all


723
01:09:54.595 --> 01:09:58.223
- and what it might be.
- Find the nest and take it.


724
01:09:58.391 --> 01:10:00.517
Of course. Send them running.

725
01:10:00.685 --> 01:10:03.436
The old Viking fallback.
Nice and simple.


726
01:10:12.363 --> 01:10:14.030
Step aside.

727
01:10:27.378 --> 01:10:28.503
Bear to port.

728
01:10:33.467 --> 01:10:37.804
If you're planning on getting eaten,
I'd definitely go with the Gronckle.


729
01:10:38.931 --> 01:10:42.976
You were wise to seek help
from the world's most deadly weapon.


730
01:10:43.144 --> 01:10:44.144
It's me.

731
01:10:44.312 --> 01:10:46.688
- I love this plan.
- I didn't...


732
01:10:46.856 --> 01:10:49.733
You're crazy. I like that.

733
01:10:50.192 --> 01:10:52.569
So, what is the plan?

734
01:11:02.747 --> 01:11:04.497
That's not really encouraging.

735
01:11:06.876 --> 01:11:08.960
I was wondering where that went.

736
01:11:20.932 --> 01:11:24.184
Stay low and ready your weapons.

737
01:11:39.867 --> 01:11:41.159
We're here.

738
01:12:14.110 --> 01:12:16.611
- Wait! What are you?
- Relax.


739
01:12:16.779 --> 01:12:18.989
It's OK. It's OK.

740
01:12:30.668 --> 01:12:31.668
Where are you going?

741
01:12:31.836 --> 01:12:34.462
You'll need something
to help you hold on.


742
01:12:43.556 --> 01:12:47.726
When we crack this mountain open,
all hell is going to break loose.


743
01:12:47.893 --> 01:12:50.854
In my undies.
Good thing I brought extras.


744
01:12:51.022 --> 01:12:54.274
No matter how this ends,
it ends today.


745
01:13:49.246 --> 01:13:50.997
Is that it?

746
01:13:55.669 --> 01:13:57.003
We've done it!

747
01:14:05.888 --> 01:14:10.058
This isn't over!
Form your ranks! Hold together!


748
01:14:23.197 --> 01:14:24.864
Get clear!

749
01:14:34.375 --> 01:14:36.918
Beard of Thor! 
What is that?!

750
01:14:41.132 --> 01:14:43.007
Odin help us.

751
01:14:47.805 --> 01:14:48.888
Catapults!

752
01:14:58.566 --> 01:15:00.942
- Get to the ships!
- No! No!


753
01:15:13.831 --> 01:15:15.748
- Smart, that one.
- I was a fool.


754
01:15:15.916 --> 01:15:18.084
Lead the men
to the far side of the island!


755
01:15:18.252 --> 01:15:19.419
Gobber, go with the men!

756
01:15:19.587 --> 01:15:22.547
I think I'll stay, in case your
thinking of doing something crazy.


757
01:15:22.715 --> 01:15:25.842
I can buy them a few minutes
if I give that thing someone to hunt!


758
01:15:26.010 --> 01:15:27.552
Then I can double that time.

759
01:15:30.264 --> 01:15:33.600
- Here!
- Oh, no! Here!


760
01:15:43.736 --> 01:15:46.905
Come on! Fight me!

761
01:15:47.072 --> 01:15:48.948
No, me!

762
01:15:55.539 --> 01:15:57.790
Ruff, Tuff! Watch your backs!

763
01:15:57.958 --> 01:16:00.126
Move, Fishlegs!

764
01:16:00.294 --> 01:16:04.130
Look at us! We're on a dragon.
We're on dragons! All of us!


765
01:16:05.799 --> 01:16:08.092
Up! Let's move it!

766
01:16:08.594 --> 01:16:13.014
Every bit the boar-headed
stubborn Viking you ever were!


767
01:16:14.808 --> 01:16:16.434
- Fishlegs, break it down!
- OK.


768
01:16:16.602 --> 01:16:19.395
Heavily armored skull and tail
made for bashing and crushing!


769
01:16:19.563 --> 01:16:23.566
Steer clear of both. Small eyes, large
nostrils! Relies on hearing and smell!


770
01:16:23.734 --> 01:16:27.111
OK, Lout, Legs! Hang in its blind spot,
make noise, keep it confused!


771
01:16:27.279 --> 01:16:30.990
Ruff, Tuff, find out
if it has a shot limit! Make it mad!


772
01:16:31.158 --> 01:16:32.533
That's my specialty!

773
01:16:32.701 --> 01:16:35.995
Since when?! Everyone knows
I'm more irritating! See.


774
01:16:36.163 --> 01:16:39.415
Just do what I told you!
I'll be back as soon as I can!


775
01:16:39.833 --> 01:16:42.335
- Don't worry! We got it covered!
- Yeah!


776
01:16:51.345 --> 01:16:52.387
- Troll!
- Butt elf!


777
01:16:52.554 --> 01:16:54.097
Bride of Grendel!

778
01:16:59.895 --> 01:17:02.355
This thing doesn't have a blind spot!

779
01:17:05.150 --> 01:17:06.150
There!

780
01:17:14.618 --> 01:17:15.785
Go help the others!

781
01:17:17.663 --> 01:17:19.038
OK, hold on. Hold on.

782
01:17:23.002 --> 01:17:25.461
- It's working!
- Yeah, it's working!


783
01:17:35.097 --> 01:17:38.474
I've lost power on the Gronckle!
Snotlout, do something!


784
01:17:41.895 --> 01:17:43.438
I'm OK!

785
01:17:43.897 --> 01:17:45.064
Less OK!

786
01:17:47.735 --> 01:17:51.446
I can't miss! What's wrong, buddy?
Something in your eye?


787
01:17:55.492 --> 01:17:57.327
Yeah! You're the Viking!

788
01:18:35.074 --> 01:18:36.199
Dad?

789
01:18:54.968 --> 01:18:56.386
You got it, bud.

790
01:18:59.223 --> 01:19:00.348
Hiccup!

791
01:19:02.851 --> 01:19:06.062
I'm sorry... for everything.

792
01:19:06.480 --> 01:19:07.563
Yeah. Me, too.

793
01:19:07.981 --> 01:19:09.607
You don't have to go up there.

794
01:19:10.317 --> 01:19:13.653
We're Vikings.
It's an occupational hazard.


795
01:19:15.030 --> 01:19:17.990
I'm proud to call you my son.

796
01:19:19.410 --> 01:19:20.410
Thanks, Dad.

797
01:19:26.500 --> 01:19:27.792
He's up!

798
01:19:30.671 --> 01:19:32.213
Get Snotlout out of there.

799
01:19:32.381 --> 01:19:33.631
- I'm on it!
- I'm on it first!


800
01:19:33.799 --> 01:19:35.341
- Hey, let me drive!
- I'm ahead of you.


801
01:19:35.509 --> 01:19:36.968
No, this way.

802
01:19:37.136 --> 01:19:39.345
- Don't push me!
- I'll take your teeth out!


803
01:19:43.392 --> 01:19:45.143
I can't believe that worked!

804
01:19:52.359 --> 01:19:53.693
Night Fury!

805
01:19:53.861 --> 01:19:55.611
Get down!

806
01:20:05.497 --> 01:20:06.539
Did you get her?

807
01:20:17.050 --> 01:20:18.050
Go.

808
01:20:18.218 --> 01:20:22.597
That thing has wings.
OK, let's see if it can use them!


809
01:20:38.572 --> 01:20:40.573
You think that did it?

810
01:20:45.496 --> 01:20:47.246
Well, he can fly.

811
01:21:08.101 --> 01:21:10.811
OK, Toothless, time to disappear.

812
01:21:10.979 --> 01:21:12.230
Come on, bud!

813
01:21:18.278 --> 01:21:19.946
Here it comes!

814
01:22:12.291 --> 01:22:13.624
Watch out!

815
01:22:15.794 --> 01:22:18.129
OK, time's up! 
Let's see if this works.

816
01:22:20.924 --> 01:22:22.925
Come on! Is that
the best you can do?!

817
01:22:40.819 --> 01:22:43.195
Stay with me, buddy.
Just a bit longer.


818
01:22:47.868 --> 01:22:49.493
Hold, Toothless.

819
01:22:50.287 --> 01:22:51.412
Now!

820
01:23:15.520 --> 01:23:16.520
No.

821
01:23:17.022 --> 01:23:18.397
No!

822
01:23:34.122 --> 01:23:38.250
Hiccup!

823
01:23:39.544 --> 01:23:40.795
Son!

824
01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:44.924
Hiccup.

825
01:24:06.697 --> 01:24:08.364
Oh, son.

826
01:24:09.950 --> 01:24:11.409
I did this.

827
01:24:41.189 --> 01:24:44.483
Oh, son, I'm so sorry.

828
01:24:51.158 --> 01:24:52.158
Hiccup!

829
01:24:58.957 --> 01:25:01.959
He's alive.
You brought him back alive.


830
01:25:18.977 --> 01:25:21.896
Thank you for saving my son.

831
01:25:22.689 --> 01:25:25.691
Well, you know... most of him.

832
01:25:44.002 --> 01:25:45.586
Hey, Toothless.

833
01:25:46.463 --> 01:25:48.714
I'm happy to see you, too.

834
01:25:51.885 --> 01:25:54.470
I'm in my house.

835
01:25:55.597 --> 01:25:57.473
You're in my house.

836
01:25:57.724 --> 01:25:59.391
Does my dad know you're here?

837
01:25:59.559 --> 01:26:01.727
What? OK, OK.

838
01:26:02.229 --> 01:26:04.313
Toothless, no. No, Toothless.

839
01:26:04.481 --> 01:26:06.607
Toothless! Oh, come on.

840
01:26:45.355 --> 01:26:47.857
OK. Thanks, bud.

841
01:26:58.535 --> 01:27:02.079
- Toothless, stay here.
- Come on, guys. Get ready!


842
01:27:02.247 --> 01:27:03.497
Hold on tight! Here we go!

843
01:27:06.751 --> 01:27:07.877
What?

844
01:27:16.136 --> 01:27:18.345
I knew it. I'm dead.

845
01:27:19.472 --> 01:27:23.475
No, but you gave it your best shot.
So, what do you think?


846
01:27:23.643 --> 01:27:25.311
Hey, look, it's Hiccup!

847
01:27:26.730 --> 01:27:27.980
It's Hiccup!

848
01:27:29.816 --> 01:27:33.652
Turns out all we needed
was a little more of this.


849
01:27:33.820 --> 01:27:35.905
You just gestured to all of me.

850
01:27:36.990 --> 01:27:40.117
Well, most of you.
That bit's my handiwork.


851
01:27:40.577 --> 01:27:43.787
With a little Hiccup flair thrown in.
You think it'll do?


852
01:27:44.164 --> 01:27:46.248
I might make a few tweaks.

853
01:27:48.126 --> 01:27:49.960
That's for scaring me.

854
01:27:50.128 --> 01:27:52.671
What is it always going
to be this way? 'Cause...


855
01:27:55.258 --> 01:27:56.800
...I could get used to it.

856
01:28:00.013 --> 01:28:01.847
Welcome home.

857
01:28:02.015 --> 01:28:04.308
- Night Fury!
- Get down!


858
01:28:15.445 --> 01:28:16.445
You ready?

859
01:28:18.573 --> 01:28:21.075
This is Berk.

860
01:28:21.534 --> 01:28:25.329
It snows nine months of the year
and hails the other three.


861
01:28:26.790 --> 01:28:30.626
Any food that grows here
is tough and tasteless.


862
01:28:32.170 --> 01:28:35.297
The people that grow here
are even more so.


863
01:28:39.177 --> 01:28:41.303
The only upsides are the pets.

864
01:28:44.224 --> 01:28:47.977
While other places
have ponies or parrots...


865
01:28:49.312 --> 01:28:50.854
...we have...

866
01:28:51.898 --> 01:28:53.315
...dragons.
