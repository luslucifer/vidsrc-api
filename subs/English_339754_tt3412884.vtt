01:00:12.223 --> 01:00:14.225
- It's Death of a Salesman.
- Where are your gloves?


1003
01:00:14.258 --> 01:00:15.359
Left 'em at home.

1004
01:00:15.392 --> 01:00:16.994
Well, I'm gonna pin 'em
to your coat


1005
01:00:17.027 --> 01:00:18.362
like we used to do
when you were little.


1006
01:00:18.395 --> 01:00:20.164
Oh, cool, with... with a string.

1007
01:00:20.197 --> 01:00:20.998
Hey!

1008
01:00:21.031 --> 01:00:22.766
Hey, asshole!

1009
01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:23.834
Yeah, you asshole!

1010
01:00:23.868 --> 01:00:24.935
Dad, dad.

1011
01:00:24.969 --> 01:00:25.870
You tellin' me he's not
an asshole?


1012
01:00:25.903 --> 01:00:27.104
He bumps into you,
doesn't say I'm sorry,


1013
01:00:27.138 --> 01:00:28.139
doesn't say excuse me.

1014
01:00:28.172 --> 01:00:29.807
That's an asshole, Penelope.

1015
01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:32.877
Uh, it's just the way it is.

1016
01:00:32.910 --> 01:00:35.112
No, it's not the way it is.

1017
01:00:35.146 --> 01:00:36.814
Not when it concerns you.

1018
01:00:36.847 --> 01:00:38.182
You listen to me.

1019
01:00:38.215 --> 01:00:41.385
Don't you ever let anyone
be anything but kind to you.


1020
01:00:41.418 --> 01:00:43.420
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, yes.


1021
01:00:43.454 --> 01:00:44.822
Do you know
what I'm talking about?


1022
01:00:44.855 --> 01:00:46.690
Dad, what's with you?

1023
01:00:46.724 --> 01:00:48.159
Nothing's with me.

1024
01:00:48.192 --> 01:00:48.993
Oh, yeah right.

1025
01:00:49.026 --> 01:00:49.860
Like all these questions.

1026
01:00:49.894 --> 01:00:51.428
Since when do you care?

1027
01:00:51.462 --> 01:00:53.164
I mean I know...
I know you care,


1028
01:00:53.197 --> 01:00:55.866
but you don't ask questions
usually.


1029
01:00:57.368 --> 01:00:59.270
The guy at the school.

1030
01:00:59.303 --> 01:01:01.105
It's Freeman, isn't it?

1031
01:01:02.006 --> 01:01:03.374
- What do you mean?
- Don't...


1032
01:01:03.407 --> 01:01:05.309
Penelope, don't bullshit me.

1033
01:01:05.342 --> 01:01:07.011
It was Freeman, wasn't it?

1034
01:01:08.512 --> 01:01:09.213
I'm not... I'm not sure.

1035
01:01:09.246 --> 01:01:12.116
It sounds like it probably was.

1036
01:01:12.149 --> 01:01:13.350
Probably?

1037
01:01:15.819 --> 01:01:17.021
I don't like this.

1038
01:01:19.190 --> 01:01:22.059
Hey, come here!

1039
01:01:22.092 --> 01:01:23.160
You say you're sorry
to my daughter!


1040
01:01:23.194 --> 01:01:24.795
- You understand me?
- What?


1041
01:01:24.828 --> 01:01:27.131
Say you're sorry
to my daughter!


1042
01:01:27.164 --> 01:01:28.432
- RUDE GUY: I'm not sure...
- For bumping into me...


1043
01:01:28.465 --> 01:01:29.967
...and not stopping to say
you were sorry.


1044
01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.368
I'm sorry for bumping
into you without stopping.


1045
01:01:31.402 --> 01:01:33.070
MR. ANCILLA:
Just say that you are sorry!


1046
01:01:33.103 --> 01:01:33.837
Just say...

1047
01:01:33.871 --> 01:01:34.905
RUDE GUY:
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!


1048
01:01:34.939 --> 01:01:36.774
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

1049
01:01:54.024 --> 01:01:55.726
Come on, baby.

1050
01:01:57.795 --> 01:01:59.830
How's your play practice going?

1051
01:01:59.863 --> 01:02:00.764
Good.

1052
01:02:19.950 --> 01:02:21.852
Got me in trouble.

1053
01:02:22.820 --> 01:02:25.557
Not that bad, but still.

1054
01:02:25.590 --> 01:02:27.358
How?

1055
01:02:27.391 --> 01:02:29.426
The security guard at school.

1056
01:02:33.931 --> 01:02:34.566
How'd you find out?

1057
01:02:34.599 --> 01:02:36.568
My father...

1058
01:02:36.601 --> 01:02:38.068
Not the school.

1059
01:02:38.102 --> 01:02:39.870
He knew it was you, so did I.

1060
01:02:41.338 --> 01:02:43.007
What happened?

1061
01:02:44.842 --> 01:02:47.144
I was looking for you and uh,

1062
01:02:47.177 --> 01:02:49.113
someone asked me if I was
a father or...


1063
01:02:49.146 --> 01:02:52.316
You didn't answer
and they called Carl.


1064
01:02:53.551 --> 01:02:56.453
He's the guard
and you assaulted him.


1065
01:02:57.354 --> 01:02:59.123
Why?

1066
01:03:01.158 --> 01:03:03.160
Freeman.

1067
01:03:04.562 --> 01:03:05.996
Couldn't you've just
walked away?


1068
01:03:06.030 --> 01:03:07.231
Why did you have to hurt him?

1069
01:03:07.264 --> 01:03:08.866
He's really nice.

1070
01:03:09.366 --> 01:03:11.302
I know.

1071
01:03:13.003 --> 01:03:14.972
You can change.

1072
01:03:15.272 --> 01:03:16.874
I can't, okay?

1073
01:03:21.211 --> 01:03:24.048
What would you do

1074
01:03:24.081 --> 01:03:26.950
if someone treated me
like you treat people?


1075
01:03:27.585 --> 01:03:29.019
People turn on you, Penelope.

1076
01:03:29.053 --> 01:03:30.120
Maybe.

1077
01:03:30.154 --> 01:03:31.422
But you don't have to
make them pay


1078
01:03:31.455 --> 01:03:33.891
just in case they might.

1079
01:03:35.527 --> 01:03:37.961
They don't deserve
the things you do.


1080
01:03:39.963 --> 01:03:41.398
[Sighs]

1081
01:03:44.602 --> 01:03:46.403
You can't come
to my school anymore.


1082
01:03:49.373 --> 01:03:51.041
I'm sorry.

1083
01:03:52.610 --> 01:03:54.511
Let's do something fun tonight.

1084
01:03:56.213 --> 01:03:57.948
What should we do?

1085
01:03:59.316 --> 01:04:01.418
Yeah, that'll be fine.

1086
01:04:03.588 --> 01:04:05.623
Who was that, honey?

1087
01:04:05.657 --> 01:04:07.424
Delivery.

1088
01:04:07.458 --> 01:04:09.226
Ooh, which one?

1089
01:04:09.259 --> 01:04:10.662
Thai Time.

1090
01:04:10.695 --> 01:04:11.428
Mmm.

1091
01:04:11.462 --> 01:04:12.996
Sounds good.

1092
01:04:13.030 --> 01:04:14.331
Are you ready, Grandpa?

1093
01:04:14.365 --> 01:04:15.499
For what?

1094
01:04:15.533 --> 01:04:16.534
The play.

1095
01:04:16.568 --> 01:04:17.468
When?

1096
01:04:17.501 --> 01:04:18.302
Now.

1097
01:04:18.335 --> 01:04:18.969
We're already late.

1098
01:04:19.002 --> 01:04:20.304
Not tonight.

1099
01:04:20.337 --> 01:04:22.607
Dad, just get up,
put on your coat, and let's go.


1100
01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:23.907
You said you wanted to go.

1101
01:04:23.941 --> 01:04:24.576
Why aren't you going?

1102
01:04:24.609 --> 01:04:25.643
'Cause I don't wanna go.

1103
01:04:25.677 --> 01:04:27.444
And I said I didn't wanna go.

1104
01:04:27.478 --> 01:04:28.680
Just get off your ass!

1105
01:04:28.713 --> 01:04:30.047
Shit.

1106
01:04:31.482 --> 01:04:33.384
Don't say you wanna do it
if you don't wanna do it.


1107
01:04:33.417 --> 01:04:35.620
I didn't say I wanted to do it.

[Laughs]

1109

You can't even get your coat on.
Come here.

01:04:41.593 --> 01:04:42.627
I... I... it's alright.

Oh you're... there you go.

Ah...

1113
01:04:44.495 --> 01:04:45.162
Yeah, you look very handsome.

1114

- Do you I look chic?
- Yeah.

You look chic.

You look like a chick.

Wow, I've never seen the city
like this before.

Do you come here a lot?

I can stroll
in the line of fire.

Step over bodies.

1129
01:06:29.701 --> 01:06:32.135
Charge a sniper,
but I could never...


1130
01:06:37.575 --> 01:06:40.043
Never felt...

1131
01:06:40.645 --> 01:06:42.680
Safe?

1132
01:06:45.449 --> 01:06:50.555
Safe enough to actually...
to step inside the park.


1133
01:06:50.588 --> 01:06:53.023
Until now.

1134

Man, I missed this view.

You have to come
to my play tonight.

Okay?

We could...

1138
01:07:08.740 --> 01:07:10.207
We could get you like, uh,
a disguise,


1139
01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:11.643
we could get you a cap

1140
01:07:11.676 --> 01:07:13.210
or you could sit
in the back row or something,


1141
01:07:13.243 --> 01:07:15.212
like we can make it work.

What were you thinking, Freeman?

1149
01:08:37.494 --> 01:08:38.930
Why would you do something
like that?

reason could you have to assault

01:17:17.314 --> 01:17:19.150
The reason why
we're all here tonight,


1331
01:17:19.183 --> 01:17:23.921
we're all gathered here is...
is to say goodbye.


1332
01:17:25.756 --> 01:17:30.060
To, without sounding too cliché,
but to...


1333
01:17:31.795 --> 01:17:33.864
To make the world
a better place.


1334
01:17:35.032 --> 01:17:37.234
And Freeman, as you
so eloquently put it


1335
01:17:37.268 --> 01:17:40.037
earlier this evening, it's...
it's an important night.


1336
01:17:40.070 --> 01:17:42.072
It is.

1337
01:17:42.106 --> 01:17:46.010
It's an important night
for all of us.


1338
01:17:50.414 --> 01:17:52.449
Is there anything you'd like
to add, Freeman?


1339
01:17:57.454 --> 01:18:00.057
This is the most people
that have ever gathered for me.


1340
01:18:00.090 --> 01:18:02.293
For...

1341
01:18:04.929 --> 01:18:06.730
For pretty much anything.

1342
01:18:09.366 --> 01:18:11.068
Thank you.

1343
01:18:16.207 --> 01:18:18.008
Freeman, they're gonna kill you.

1344
01:18:22.146 --> 01:18:23.881
I know.

1345
01:18:25.349 --> 01:18:25.983
Leave.

1346
01:18:26.016 --> 01:18:26.884
Let's leave now.

1347
01:18:26.917 --> 01:18:27.985
Penelope.

1348
01:18:28.018 --> 01:18:29.386
Penelope, what are you
talking about?


1349
01:18:29.420 --> 01:18:30.821
Who is killing whom?

1350
01:18:32.089 --> 01:18:33.424
You're really scaring me.

1351
01:18:33.457 --> 01:18:35.726
Daddy's gonna kill Freeman.

1352
01:18:36.661 --> 01:18:39.430
Honey, tell your daughter
you are not killing Freeman.


1353
01:18:42.333 --> 01:18:44.835
Tom, tell her.

1354
01:18:47.972 --> 01:18:49.440
Tom, this is not funny.

1355
01:18:49.473 --> 01:18:51.275
We have company.

1356
01:18:52.243 --> 01:18:54.144
This is not a funny joke.

1357
01:18:54.945 --> 01:18:57.114
Soup's getting cold.

1358
01:19:05.122 --> 01:19:06.056
I'm calling the police.

1359
01:19:06.090 --> 01:19:07.525
You will sit down now!

1360
01:19:09.326 --> 01:19:10.928
Sit down!

1361
01:19:10.961 --> 01:19:12.062
Why is she here?

1362
01:19:12.096 --> 01:19:13.197
Why is Cabbot here?

1363
01:19:13.230 --> 01:19:13.764
Why are they here?

1364
01:19:13.797 --> 01:19:15.567
She is a hooker, dad.

1365
01:19:15.600 --> 01:19:17.268
- Penelope.
- Penelope.


1366
01:19:17.301 --> 01:19:19.970
Sit down now.

1367
01:19:21.038 --> 01:19:22.206
Let's eat.

1368
01:19:22.239 --> 01:19:24.408
Please sit down.

1369
01:19:36.487 --> 01:19:37.955
Soup's delicious, Elly.

1370
01:19:37.988 --> 01:19:39.223
It really is.

1371
01:19:43.093 --> 01:19:46.864
Penelope, what are you
talking about?


1372
01:19:48.165 --> 01:19:51.035
Elly, she's not a... a caterer.

1373
01:19:51.068 --> 01:19:52.069
She's a call girl.

1374
01:19:52.102 --> 01:19:52.903
Freeman calls her.

1375
01:19:52.936 --> 01:19:54.405
I don't know
what she's doing here.


1376
01:19:56.574 --> 01:19:59.043
We're all here,
because there's no one else


1377
01:19:59.076 --> 01:20:00.978
who cares.

1378
01:20:01.011 --> 01:20:02.880
There's no one else
who will notice.


1379
01:20:04.582 --> 01:20:07.351
I think it's actually
a pretty good turnout.


1380
01:20:07.384 --> 01:20:16.293
[♪♪♪]

1381
01:20:27.672 --> 01:20:29.373
Thank you.

1382
01:20:32.242 --> 01:20:34.579
What the hell is going on here?

1383
01:20:34.612 --> 01:20:36.914
Tom?

1384
01:20:36.947 --> 01:20:38.516
I don't even know
where to start.


1385
01:20:41.118 --> 01:20:44.488
You invited a call girl
into our house


1386
01:20:44.522 --> 01:20:49.126
who is sleeping
with our daughter's boyfriend


1387
01:20:49.159 --> 01:20:53.163
whom you plan on murdering
after we all have a fine dinner.


1388
01:20:53.197 --> 01:20:55.132
This is not happening!

1389
01:21:00.605 --> 01:21:02.206
And you.

1390
01:21:02.239 --> 01:21:04.074
You should not even be here.

1391
01:21:04.108 --> 01:21:06.243
I definitely should be here.

1392
01:21:06.276 --> 01:21:08.412
I mean, I'm the one who found
Mr. Ancilla's card


1393
01:21:08.445 --> 01:21:11.281
in Elly's client rolodex.

1394
01:21:11.315 --> 01:21:13.484
I knew you looked familiar.

1395
01:21:18.355 --> 01:21:20.424
[Grandpa laughs]

1396
01:21:20.457 --> 01:21:22.059
Tom.

1397
01:21:24.194 --> 01:21:26.029
Tom.

1398
01:21:36.306 --> 01:21:38.576
I would like you to leave.

1399
01:21:38.610 --> 01:21:39.644
No.

1400
01:21:43.615 --> 01:21:46.116
Did you hear me?

1401
01:21:48.318 --> 01:21:51.288
I will not have you
in my house.


1402
01:21:51.321 --> 01:21:53.323
This is my house!

1403
01:21:53.357 --> 01:21:55.627
My kitchen!

1404
01:21:55.660 --> 01:21:57.928
My husband!

1405
01:21:59.664 --> 01:22:01.533
You slept with my father?

1406
01:22:03.300 --> 01:22:07.037
Yes, I slept with your father,
your husband,


1407
01:22:07.070 --> 01:22:09.473
and Cabbot, and Freeman,
because that's my job.


1408
01:22:15.680 --> 01:22:17.414
Get out of my kitchen!

1409
01:22:19.617 --> 01:22:21.719
I'm really sorry
that so many people got hurt.


1410
01:22:21.753 --> 01:22:23.987
I'm sorry it got complicated.

1411
01:22:25.422 --> 01:22:27.257
You hurt people every day.

1412
01:22:27.291 --> 01:22:29.727
Yeah, well, then

1413
01:22:29.761 --> 01:22:32.062
Freeman and I would be
perfect for each other.


1414
01:22:35.466 --> 01:22:37.167
Shameless tart.

1415
01:22:40.370 --> 01:22:42.272
Mom, they're gonna kill
Freeman.


1416
01:22:45.810 --> 01:22:48.011
I know, sweetie.

1417
01:22:48.045 --> 01:22:50.981
I'm really, really sorry.

1418
01:23:03.327 --> 01:23:05.162
Elly, pass me the scotch please.

1419
01:23:05.195 --> 01:23:06.163
I know what you're doing, dad.

1420
01:23:06.196 --> 01:23:07.464
And if you do this,

1421
01:23:07.498 --> 01:23:10.434
I will call the police
and you will go to jail.


1422
01:23:12.169 --> 01:23:14.238
Penny, you're not gonna call
the police.


1423
01:23:14.271 --> 01:23:16.340
That's not how we do things
in this family.


1424
01:23:16.373 --> 01:23:18.442
We're open and we're honest.

1425
01:23:19.443 --> 01:23:21.211
And I haven't been.

1426
01:23:21.245 --> 01:23:23.180
I did it this way,
because I want to be.


1427
01:23:23.213 --> 01:23:24.481
I want us to start over.

1428
01:23:24.516 --> 01:23:26.216
Me, you and your mom.

1429
01:23:26.250 --> 01:23:28.385
I'm sorry for what I did.

1430
01:23:29.286 --> 01:23:31.789
I'm gonna put the past,
all of it behind us.


1431
01:23:31.823 --> 01:23:34.091
I didn't wanna do this
behind your back,


1432
01:23:34.124 --> 01:23:35.593
because that would be dishonest.

1433
01:23:35.627 --> 01:23:37.461
Do you... do you hear yourself?

1434
01:23:37.494 --> 01:23:38.796
You sound ridiculous.

1435
01:23:38.830 --> 01:23:40.497
Is it?

1436
01:23:40.532 --> 01:23:42.132
Would you have wanted me
to do this without you knowing?


1437
01:23:42.165 --> 01:23:43.601
No, I don't want you
to do it at all.


1438
01:23:43.635 --> 01:23:46.436
Why? It's the most human thing
we could do for you,


1439
01:23:46.470 --> 01:23:48.071
for Freeman, for all of us.

1440
01:23:48.105 --> 01:23:49.106
Freeman will be dead.

1441
01:23:49.139 --> 01:23:50.173
Murdered.

1442
01:23:50.207 --> 01:23:51.174
How can that be the best
for anyone?


1443
01:23:51.208 --> 01:23:52.442
Freeman knows.

1444
01:23:53.811 --> 01:23:55.680
Right, Freeman?

1445
01:23:55.713 --> 01:23:58.115
You realize
this is the only way?


1446
01:23:59.784 --> 01:24:01.653
He doesn't love you, sweetie.

1447
01:24:01.686 --> 01:24:04.388
He's incapable of that kind
of emotion.


1448
01:24:05.023 --> 01:24:07.224
Now I'm sorry, sweetie,
but ask him.


1449
01:24:07.257 --> 01:24:07.892
No, no.

1450
01:24:07.926 --> 01:24:09.092
You don't know how he feels.

1451
01:24:09.126 --> 01:24:10.494
You don't even know him.

1452
01:24:10.528 --> 01:24:11.495
I know enough.

1453
01:24:11.529 --> 01:24:12.296
No, you don't.

1454
01:24:12.329 --> 01:24:13.297
I know him.

1455
01:24:13.330 --> 01:24:14.464
I love him.

1456
01:24:14.498 --> 01:24:15.867
Sweetie, I'm sorry.

1457
01:24:15.900 --> 01:24:17.569
- You do not love him.
- PENELOPE: Don't say that!


1458
01:24:17.602 --> 01:24:20.672
You have no right to clarify
what love is or isn't,


1459
01:24:20.705 --> 01:24:22.406
you slept with that
fucking hooker.


1460
01:24:22.439 --> 01:24:23.575
So did Freeman.

1461
01:24:23.608 --> 01:24:24.576
Why?

1462
01:24:24.609 --> 01:24:26.176
MRS. ANCILLA:
Stop this now!


1463
01:24:28.546 --> 01:24:30.748
I have had enough!

1464
01:24:30.782 --> 01:24:32.416
This is ridiculous!

1465
01:24:34.484 --> 01:24:35.787
You do see that, don't you?

1466
01:24:35.820 --> 01:24:39.222
What I see is that everybody
wants Freeman to die.


1467
01:24:39.256 --> 01:24:39.724
I...

1468
01:24:39.757 --> 01:24:40.424
That's what I see.

1469
01:24:40.457 --> 01:24:41.526
I don't.

1470
01:24:41.559 --> 01:24:42.492
You don't want him
with our daughter.


1471
01:24:42.527 --> 01:24:45.262
No, but I do not see the need
to kill him.


1472
01:24:45.295 --> 01:24:46.496
Honey, what the fuck?

1473
01:24:46.531 --> 01:24:47.599
CABBOT:
Look, he's not gonna go away!


1474
01:24:47.632 --> 01:24:49.834
Okay, if it's not Penny,
it's gonna be someone else.


1475
01:24:49.867 --> 01:24:50.635
PENELOPE:
Shut up, Cabbot.


1476
01:24:50.668 --> 01:24:51.401
You don't know shit.

1477
01:24:51.435 --> 01:24:53.203
I don't even know
why you're here.


1478
01:24:53.236 --> 01:24:53.905
Shut your mouth.

1479
01:24:53.938 --> 01:24:55.138
No, I'm... I'm a part of this.

1480
01:24:55.940 --> 01:24:57.174
Shut your fucking mouth!

1481
01:24:57.207 --> 01:24:59.309
Shut your fucking mouth!

1482
01:24:59.343 --> 01:25:00.510
Shut up!

1483
01:25:01.846 --> 01:25:04.782
[Freeman laughs]

1484
01:25:07.184 --> 01:25:07.819
What do you think, Freeman?

1485
01:25:07.852 --> 01:25:09.386
Pay attention.

1486
01:25:10.955 --> 01:25:12.389
What do you think?

1487
01:25:12.422 --> 01:25:13.290
About what?

1488
01:25:13.323 --> 01:25:15.793
Whether you should
continue on living?


1489
01:25:15.827 --> 01:25:17.629
No, lots of people feel
like they don't belong,


1490
