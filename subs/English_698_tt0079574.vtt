mgunner@hanmail.net

2
00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.343
How we doing, Richard?

3
00:01:02.472 --> 00:01:05.389
We should pass over England

4
00:01:05.517 --> 00:01:08.054
With this load, that's good going.

5
00:01:08.852 --> 00:01:10.891
Just trust the RAF, sir.

6
00:01:47.763 --> 00:01:51.012
- What the hell is that?
- It's the shuttle ignition!


7
00:02:05.862 --> 00:02:09.694
Disappeared?
What happened to the Moonraker?


8
00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.949
Good God!

9
00:02:16.497 --> 00:02:19.284
Yes, of course, Minister. Right away.

10
00:02:25.964 --> 00:02:29.878
Moneypenny,
ls 007 back from that African job?


11
00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:31.551
He's on his last leg.

12
00:02:38.976 --> 00:02:42.474
Any higher, Mr Bond, my ears will pop.

13
00:02:46.732 --> 00:02:49.851
I don't think I'll
ever fly with anyone else.

14
00:02:49.985 --> 00:02:52.025
You're so right, Mr Bond.

15
00:03:00.578 --> 00:03:04.445
- This is where we leave you, Mr Bond.
- A little premature, isn't it?


16
00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.626
Enjoy your flight.

17
00:08:59.151 --> 00:09:03.362
- Good morning, Moneypenny.
- James! Why are you so late?


18
00:09:03.488 --> 00:09:06.738
I fell out of an aeroplane
without a parachute.


19
00:09:06.866 --> 00:09:10.318
- Who's in there?
- Q and the Minister of Defence.


20
00:09:10.453 --> 00:09:11.651
You don't believe me?

21
00:09:11.787 --> 00:09:15.915
- And you should go right in.
- Yes, Moneypenny.


22
00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:21.117
007! At last.

23
00:09:21.254 --> 00:09:22.534
Good morning, sir.

24
00:09:22.672 --> 00:09:25.245
You know Frederick Gray,
Minister of Defence.


25
00:09:25.383 --> 00:09:27.007
- Commander.
- Minister, Q.


26
00:09:27.134 --> 00:09:29.257
007.

27
00:09:31.264 --> 00:09:33.090
Moonraker?

28
00:09:33.223 --> 00:09:37.267
- What do you know about Moonraker?
- What I read in the newspapers.


29
00:09:37.393 --> 00:09:43.016
The Moonraker shuttle was being flown
over here on loan, on the back of a 747.


30
00:09:43.149 --> 00:09:47.442
Which crashed in the Yukon.
Aircraft and shuttle destroyed.


31
00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:49.229
In the official version.

32
00:09:49.363 --> 00:09:52.946
The truth is more disturbing, 007.
Look at this.


33
00:09:59.622 --> 00:10:01.698
That's the scene of the crash.

34
00:10:01.832 --> 00:10:05.532
Wreckage strewn everywhere.
That's the fuselage.


35
00:10:05.752 --> 00:10:10.046
We've been through it thoroughly,
but there's no sign of Moonraker.


36
00:10:10.173 --> 00:10:12.842
So the shuttle was hijacked in mid-air?

37
00:10:12.967 --> 00:10:15.007
That's for you to find out.

38
00:10:15.136 --> 00:10:17.543
It was built in California
by Drax lndustries.


39
00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:21.808
Yes. We were responsible
for the safety of that shuttle.


40
00:10:21.934 --> 00:10:25.978
The United States government
is justifiably concerned.


41
00:10:26.104 --> 00:10:30.054
- So California must be the place to start.
- I agree.


42
00:10:30.191 --> 00:10:34.520
Don't make any mistakes, 007.
This situation is critical.


43
00:10:34.653 --> 00:10:37.987
- We've got to find that shuttle.
- Yes, sir.


44
00:10:38.866 --> 00:10:43.823
- If that's all, gentlemen?
- Just a minute. I have something for you.


45
00:10:46.831 --> 00:10:48.870
Roll up your right sleeve.

46
00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:53.245
This is being issued
as standard equipment.


47
00:10:53.379 --> 00:10:55.418
Strap it on your wrist.

48
00:10:59.217 --> 00:11:02.751
It's activated by nerve impulses
from the wrist.


49
00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:04.465
Like this?

50
00:11:06.599 --> 00:11:08.638
Oh, thank you, 007!

51
00:11:09.018 --> 00:11:11.639
- Be careful.
- Yes, Q.


52
00:11:11.854 --> 00:11:14.391
Five blue-tipped armour-piercing darts,

53
00:11:14.523 --> 00:11:18.983
five red-tipped cyanide-coated,
causing death in 30 seconds.


54
00:11:19.111 --> 00:11:22.443
You must get them
in the stores for Christmas!


55
00:11:22.947 --> 00:11:25.438
Good morning, gentlemen.

56
00:11:36.959 --> 00:11:40.827
- Welcome to California, Mr Bond.
- I like it already.


57
00:11:52.181 --> 00:11:54.221
My name is Corinne Dufour.

58
00:11:54.643 --> 00:11:57.014
Are you going to show me around?

59
00:11:57.395 --> 00:12:01.143
No, I'm just a humble pilot
for the Drax Corporation.


60
00:12:11.783 --> 00:12:16.361
This is the Drax estate.
Everything you see belongs to Mr Drax.


61
00:12:17.663 --> 00:12:21.327
- He owns a lot.
- What he doesn't own, he doesn't want.


62
00:12:26.296 --> 00:12:29.000
We're approaching the main complex.

63
00:12:31.259 --> 00:12:34.045
- That's where the Moonraker is made?
- That's right.


64
00:12:34.178 --> 00:12:38.756
Workshops, hangars,
design and experimental blocks,


65
00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:41.760
- everything.
- Very impressive.


66
00:12:52.153 --> 00:12:56.149
I'd heard Hugo Drax is obsessed
with the conquest of space.


67
00:12:56.281 --> 00:12:58.321
Now I can believe it.

68
00:12:59.284 --> 00:13:00.398
Good Lord!

69
00:13:08.542 --> 00:13:12.492
The Drax residence.
Every stone brought from France.


70
00:13:13.964 --> 00:13:16.917
- Cute, isn't it?
- Magnificent.


71
00:13:17.049 --> 00:13:22.340
- Why didn't he buy the Eiffel Tower too?
- He did. He was refused an export permit.


72
00:13:40.112 --> 00:13:43.066
Look there!
Those are the astronaut trainees.


73
00:13:43.198 --> 00:13:47.242
Mr Drax is financing the entire
programme out of his own pocket.


74
00:13:48.245 --> 00:13:51.328
Seems to have an eye
for a good investment!


75
00:14:11.599 --> 00:14:16.473
Mr Drax will see Mr Bond
in the drawing room, Miss Dufour.


76
00:14:16.604 --> 00:14:18.643
This way, please, sir.

77
00:14:57.223 --> 00:14:59.262
Mr Bond, sir.

78
00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:05.771
- Mr Bond.
- Mr Drax.


79
00:15:06.106 --> 00:15:12.642
Let me present Countess Lubinski,
Lady Victoria Devon - Mr Bond.


80
00:15:13.029 --> 00:15:14.773
How do you do?

81
00:15:17.158 --> 00:15:21.025
Well, my dear fellow,
your reputation precedes you.


82
00:15:21.787 --> 00:15:25.570
I'm honoured you were sent
on so delicate a mission.


83
00:15:25.999 --> 00:15:27.374
Delicate?

84
00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:31.545
To apologise in person
for the loss of my space shuttle.


85
00:15:33.089 --> 00:15:35.545
How would Oscar Wilde have put it?

86
00:15:36.509 --> 00:15:40.636
To lose one aircraft
may be regarded as a misfortune.


87
00:15:42.096 --> 00:15:45.014
To lose two seems like carelessness.

88
00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:52.260
An apology will be made
to the American government


89
00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:56.057
when we've discovered why
the Moonraker wasn't in that wreckage.


90
00:15:56.736 --> 00:15:59.689
Your loyalty commands respect, Mr Bond.

91
00:16:02.115 --> 00:16:04.736
You have arrived at
a propitious moment,


92
00:16:04.868 --> 00:16:10.027
coincident with your country's
one contribution to Western civilisation.


93
00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:12.573
Afternoon tea.

94
00:16:12.708 --> 00:16:16.159
May I press you to
a cucumber sandwich?


95
00:16:16.377 --> 00:16:18.417
Thank you, no. 
Nothing at all.

96
00:16:18.547 --> 00:16:21.298
Is the shuttle made entirely
here in California?


97
00:16:21.716 --> 00:16:26.259
No, I own a number of subsidiaries
worldwide, producing components.


98
00:16:26.387 --> 00:16:31.760
The conquest of space is an investment
in the future of the human race, Mr Bond.


99
00:16:32.476 --> 00:16:36.389
It is therefore logical to seek out
the best from each nation.


100
00:16:38.147 --> 00:16:41.397
Are you referring to people or skills?

101
00:16:42.318 --> 00:16:44.357
Both, Mr Bond.

102
00:16:53.578 --> 00:16:55.535
Am I too soon?

103
00:16:55.663 --> 00:17:00.040
Not at all. I'm sure Mr Bond
is eager to start his tour.


104
00:17:01.002 --> 00:17:05.828
Miss Dufour will escort you
to Dr Goodhead. Ask anything you like.


105
00:17:06.965 --> 00:17:10.630
- Thank you for being so cooperative.
- A pleasure.


106
00:17:20.602 --> 00:17:22.642
Look after Mr Bond.

107
00:17:23.563 --> 00:17:25.805
See that some harm comes to him.

108
00:17:30.111 --> 00:17:33.277
You'll find Dr Goodhead first on the right.

109
00:17:33.614 --> 00:17:37.742
- Thank you for the ride.
- Call on me if you need anything.


110
00:18:01.055 --> 00:18:03.546
- Good afternoon.
- Can I help you?


111
00:18:03.682 --> 00:18:07.680
My name is Bond. James Bond.
I'm looking for Dr Goodhead.


112
00:18:08.103 --> 00:18:10.142
You just found her.

113
00:18:10.814 --> 00:18:12.439
A woman!

114
00:18:12.566 --> 00:18:16.266
Your powers of observation
do you credit, Mr Bond.


115
00:18:16.486 --> 00:18:18.478
James. To my friends.

116
00:18:19.531 --> 00:18:20.906
Holly Goodhead.

117
00:18:21.949 --> 00:18:24.570
Are you training to be an astronaut?

118
00:18:24.701 --> 00:18:27.537
I'm fully trained - on loan from NASA.

119
00:18:27.663 --> 00:18:30.699
The space administration.

120
00:18:31.207 --> 00:18:34.208
Well, Mr Bond,
I guess we'd better get started.


121
00:18:34.336 --> 00:18:38.747
You don't want to lose time
as well as a space shuttle, do you?


122
00:18:46.012 --> 00:18:47.922
This is it - the Moonraker.

123
00:18:48.056 --> 00:18:50.214
Capable of being launched into space

124
00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:55.640
And re-entering the atmosphere
to land like any conventional aircraft.


125
00:19:01.234 --> 00:19:03.523
This is the centrifuge trainer.

126
00:19:04.529 --> 00:19:09.024
It simulates the gravity force you feel
when shot into space.


127
00:19:13.871 --> 00:19:17.038
The speed is controlled from up there.

128
00:19:17.166 --> 00:19:18.328
Why not try it?

129
00:19:20.668 --> 00:19:22.625
Why not?

130
00:19:28.717 --> 00:19:31.006
Strap yourself in firmly.

131
00:19:31.804 --> 00:19:33.381
Yes, Doctor!

132
00:19:34.639 --> 00:19:36.678
Now your arms.

133
00:19:37.225 --> 00:19:40.925
That's to prevent you from
knocking yourself out.


134
00:19:48.068 --> 00:19:50.772
How fast does it go?

135
00:19:52.406 --> 00:19:54.943
Up to 20 Gs,
but that would be fatal.

136
00:19:55.450 --> 00:19:59.946
Three Gs is takeoff pressure.
Most people pass out at seven.


137
00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:03.999
You'd make a great saleswoman.

138
00:20:04.124 --> 00:20:08.074
You don't have to worry.
This is a "chicken switch".


139
00:20:08.212 --> 00:20:14.380
The moment the pressure gets too much,
release the button and the power's cut off.


140
00:20:14.551 --> 00:20:16.009
Just like that?

141
00:20:16.427 --> 00:20:20.045
Come on! A 70-year-old can take three Gs.

142
00:20:20.765 --> 00:20:24.512
Trouble is, there's never
a 70-year-old around when you need one.


143
00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:34.144
- Do you want me?
- Mr Drax says to telephone him.


144
00:20:34.276 --> 00:20:36.103
I'll call him from my office.

145
00:20:36.237 --> 00:20:38.562
You go ahead. I'll be right back.

146
00:20:39.865 --> 00:20:44.076
The instructor will supervise the session.
Enjoy yourself.


147
00:20:52.543 --> 00:20:55.247
Yes, we're taking good care of him.

148
00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:28.679
I don't know what could have happened.

149
00:23:28.809 --> 00:23:33.435
Something must have gone wrong
with the controls.


150
00:23:46.783 --> 00:23:48.823
Let me help you.

151
00:24:20.188 --> 00:24:24.138
My mother gave me a list of things
not to do on a first date.


152
00:24:24.276 --> 00:24:27.940
Maybe you won't need it.
That's not what I came for.


153
00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:30.477
No? What do you want, then?

154
00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:38.362
Would your feelings be shattered
if I were to say "information"?


155
00:24:38.497 --> 00:24:40.655
Why should I tell you anything?

156
00:24:40.790 --> 00:24:42.829
Why indeed?

157
00:24:48.213 --> 00:24:50.668
You presume a great deal, Mr Bond.

158
00:25:07.064 --> 00:25:12.935
What goes on here besides Moonraker
and the astronaut programme?


159
00:25:13.069 --> 00:25:17.398
There are the laboratories,
but not much is happening now.


160
00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:19.447
No?

161
00:25:19.575 --> 00:25:24.616
They were working on something
very secret, but everything's been moved.


162
00:25:24.788 --> 00:25:26.827
Where to?

163
00:25:28.834 --> 00:25:30.873
I don't know.

164
00:25:36.799 --> 00:25:40.499
What about that list of your mother's?

165
00:25:40.802 --> 00:25:42.842
I never learnt to read.

166
00:26:41.357 --> 00:26:43.396
What are you doing?

167
00:26:44.109 --> 00:26:47.561
You whetted my appetite for information.

168
00:26:47.696 --> 00:26:49.938
Is there a safe in here?

169
00:26:50.282 --> 00:26:52.321
Thank you.

170
00:26:53.744 --> 00:26:55.570
James, no!

171
00:27:38.242 --> 00:27:40.281
That's amazing!

172
00:27:42.036 --> 00:27:44.824
There you are. 
You have a heart of gold.

173
00:27:45.790 --> 00:27:47.829
18-carat.

174
00:28:24.283 --> 00:28:25.362
You must go.

175
00:28:25.492 --> 00:28:28.244
You go first. I'll turn off the lights.

176
00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:35.789
Thank you.

177
00:28:43.008 --> 00:28:46.211
- Take care of yourself.
- And you.


178
00:30:24.057 --> 00:30:30.475
Ah, my dear Bond. This is Mademoiselle
Deladier and La Signorina del Mateo.


179
00:30:31.189 --> 00:30:34.059
- Ladies.
- I'll see you at lunch.


180
00:30:36.485 --> 00:30:39.237
A pity you leave us. 
Such good sport.

181
00:30:40.363 --> 00:30:42.273
Unless you're a pheasant.

182
00:30:42.408 --> 00:30:45.990
Oh, really, Mr Bond!
Take my gun - a stray bird may fly over.


183
00:30:46.119 --> 00:30:48.871
I only stopped to thank you
for your hospitality.


184
00:30:48.997 --> 00:30:51.534
Fraser will get you to the airport.

185
00:30:54.334 --> 00:30:56.374
Come now.

186
00:31:14.936 --> 00:31:18.519
- I doubt if I'm in your class.
- You're too modest.


187
00:31:26.822 --> 00:31:28.696
Over there.

188
00:31:36.289 --> 00:31:37.783
You missed.

189
00:31:40.710 --> 00:31:42.749
Did l?

190
00:31:43.629 --> 00:31:46.630
As you said, such good sport.

191
00:32:10.862 --> 00:32:13.613
You called for me, Mr Drax?

192
00:32:14.031 --> 00:32:18.242
You were with Bond last night
in my study. You showed him the safe.


193
00:32:18.369 --> 00:32:21.488
- I didn't.
- I'm terminating your employment.


194
00:32:21.621 --> 00:32:23.780
You will leave immediately.

195
00:33:54.413 --> 00:33:57.200
Franco, I'll call you where to meet me.

196
00:34:18.477 --> 00:34:23.352
- Could I interest you in something?
- I'm tempted to say yes immediately,


197
00:34:23.482 --> 00:34:25.604
but I'd better have a look around.

198
00:34:26.234 --> 00:34:28.985
Please, go anywhere you wish.

199
00:35:14.527 --> 00:35:17.563
...were taken over by Drax lndustries.

200
00:35:18.072 --> 00:35:21.820
Here we have some of the rarest
examples of the glassblower's art.


201
00:35:22.826 --> 00:35:25.780
Everything was done absolutely by hand.

202
00:35:26.746 --> 00:35:33.282
Here is a vase done by Lorenzo Graziati
between 1850 and 1860. And over here...


203
00:35:36.964 --> 00:35:43.381
This exquisite bowl was fashioned
about 1 520, over 450 years ago.


204
00:35:43.512 --> 00:35:48.552
If it ever came on the market
it would certainly fetch in excess of $1 m.


205
00:35:49.267 --> 00:35:51.936
But if any of you
were thinking of taking it...


206
00:35:54.396 --> 00:35:58.892
Here we have a very early 17th century
dish with an aquamarine medallion.


207
00:35:59.151 --> 00:36:02.435
Over here, we have something
very, very interesting.


208
00:36:03.405 --> 00:36:07.982
This glass-handled sword,
the only one of its kind in the world,


209
00:36:09.159 --> 00:36:13.868
was owned by General Menotti
in the late 18th century...


210
00:36:47.403 --> 00:36:49.442
14th century.

211
00:36:53.575 --> 00:36:55.318
Dr Goodhead!

212
00:36:55.451 --> 00:37:00.694
I hope your presence is a coincidence.
I dislike being spied on.


213
00:37:00.832 --> 00:37:02.871
Don't we all?

214
00:37:03.667 --> 00:37:05.873
You're staying at the Danieli?

215
00:37:06.002 --> 00:37:10.130
- Yes. How did you know?
- I like to keep abreast of things.


216
00:37:11.007 --> 00:37:13.711
May I ask what you're doing in Venice?

217
00:37:14.427 --> 00:37:17.677
Addressing
the European Space Commission.


218
00:37:17.846 --> 00:37:19.886
Heady stuff!

219
00:37:20.057 --> 00:37:24.054
There again, I keep forgetting you are
more than just a beautiful woman.


220
00:37:25.770 --> 00:37:28.807
If you're trying to be ingratiating,
don't bother.


221
00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:31.182
I have more important things on my mind.

222
00:37:31.317 --> 00:37:34.401
That's what I'd like to talk about.
Dinner this evening?


223
00:37:34.528 --> 00:37:37.102
This evening I'm giving my address.

224
00:37:37.239 --> 00:37:40.738
Then can you think of a reason
for not having a drink afterwards?


225
00:37:40.867 --> 00:37:44.568
Not immediately. 
But I'm sure I shall.

226
00:37:48.082 --> 00:37:50.122
Franco!

227
00:49:03.607 --> 00:49:05.932
Play it again, Sam.

228
00:49:37.262 --> 00:49:40.132
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Convalescing.


229
00:49:40.265 --> 00:49:43.964
Your friend Chang just tried to kill me.

230
00:49:44.144 --> 00:49:49.647
- You think I had something to do with it?
- It had flashed across my mind.


231
00:49:50.857 --> 00:49:56.196
- What's Drax up to in that laboratory?
- Why don't you ask him yourself?


232
00:49:57.738 --> 00:50:02.696
- You're leaving me your phone number?
- I don't see the point.


233
00:50:03.827 --> 00:50:05.619
Ah, now I do.

234
00:50:07.748 --> 00:50:11.163
Not what I want
to get stuck with tonight.

235
00:50:12.836 --> 00:50:15.457
James, why don't you
pour yourself a drink?


236
00:50:16.297 --> 00:50:18.336
Thank you.

237
00:50:21.344 --> 00:50:23.383
Daily diary.

238
00:50:28.767 --> 00:50:30.806
Fairly deadly diary.

239
00:50:32.645 --> 00:50:36.725
Bollinger!
lf it's '69, you were expecting me.


240
00:50:56.459 --> 00:50:58.783
A trifle overpowering, your scent.

241
00:51:08.010 --> 00:51:13.597
Standard CIA equipment -
and they placed you with Drax. Correct?


242
00:51:13.724 --> 00:51:18.469
- Very astute of you.
- Not really. I have friends in low places.


243
00:51:18.603 --> 00:51:23.229
Could this possibly be the moment
for us to pool our resources?


244
00:51:23.357 --> 00:51:25.765
It could have its compensations.

245
00:51:39.998 --> 00:51:42.702
Where are you planning on
going from here?


246
00:51:42.833 --> 00:51:45.751
I'm not planning on going anywhere.

247
00:51:47.755 --> 00:51:52.166
I suppose you're right, Holly.
We would be better off working together.


248
00:51:52.718 --> 00:51:54.757
- D?ente?
- Agreed.


249
00:51:55.929 --> 00:51:58.763
- Understanding?
- Possibly.


250
00:51:59.807 --> 00:52:02.808
- Cooperation?
- Maybe.


251
00:52:03.685 --> 00:52:06.140
- Trust?
- Out of the question.


252
00:52:39.885 --> 00:52:44.677
Send the night porter up for my bags
immediately, please.


253
00:52:49.978 --> 00:52:54.224
I hope you know what you're
doing, Bond. I've played bridge with Drax.


254
00:52:54.398 --> 00:52:59.143
007 doesn't usually push the panic button
unless it's something serious.


255
00:52:59.277 --> 00:53:02.361
You've covered everything
with our ltalian friends?


256
00:53:02.488 --> 00:53:04.113
Yes, sir.

257
00:53:16.376 --> 00:53:18.203
- Is this it?
- Yes, sir.


258
00:53:22.089 --> 00:53:26.087
- Gas masks?
- We can't afford to take any chances.


259
00:54:01.292 --> 00:54:04.126
Frederick Gray, what a surprise!

260
00:54:04.252 --> 00:54:08.333
And in distinguished company,
all wearing gas masks!


261
00:54:08.798 --> 00:54:10.541
You must excuse me.

262
00:54:10.675 --> 00:54:15.300
Not being English, I sometimes find
your sense of humour difficult to follow.


263
00:54:19.683 --> 00:54:24.345
On behalf of the British government,
I apologise.


264
00:54:25.730 --> 00:54:29.145
I think you owe us an explanation, 007.

265
00:54:29.483 --> 00:54:32.650
I've never been so humiliated in my life.

266
00:54:32.778 --> 00:54:38.068
Your man should be taken off the
assignment. I'll see you at the consulate.


267
00:54:38.200 --> 00:54:40.737
I'll have to do what he says.

268
00:54:40.869 --> 00:54:45.281
Before you do that sir,
have Q do an analysis of this.


269
00:54:46.582 --> 00:54:52.252
I took it from the laboratory.
Tell him to exercise caution. It is lethal.


270
00:54:53.338 --> 00:54:55.876
So there was a laboratory.

271
00:54:57.758 --> 00:55:00.760
You'd better take
two weeks' leave of absence.


272
00:55:02.013 --> 00:55:08.015
- Any thoughts on where you might go?
- I've always had a hankering to go to Rio.


273
00:55:08.477 --> 00:55:13.352
I think I can recall
your mentioning it. 007...


274
00:55:13.482 --> 00:55:16.850
No slip-ups - or we're both in trouble.

275
00:55:23.032 --> 00:55:25.901
A minor crisis has been averted.

276
00:55:26.034 --> 00:55:31.028
No, nothing serious, but all merchandise
is to be rerouted as from today.


277
00:55:31.831 --> 00:55:36.872
Now, regarding a replacement for Chang.
You have someone in mind?


278
00:55:37.753 --> 00:55:40.670
Oh yes, well.
If you can get him, of course...


279
00:55:41.007 --> 00:55:46.711
Flight BA128 to Rio de Janeiro
now boarding at Gate 7.


280
00:56:20.500 --> 00:56:22.788
Welcome to Rio, Mr Bond.

281
00:57:04.498 --> 00:57:06.705
The President's Suite.

282
00:57:06.834 --> 00:57:12.456
Really? Don't bother showing me the rest.
If I get lost I'll take a cab.


283
00:57:30.563 --> 00:57:34.227
- Do you come with the suite?
- It depends who's renting it.


284
00:57:34.358 --> 00:57:37.312
Vodka martini, shaken not stirred.

285
00:57:39.071 --> 00:57:43.068
- Why were you following me?
- I was trying to meet you.


286
00:57:43.325 --> 00:57:48.531
I'm Manuela. I work for Station VH.
We have been asked to assist you.


287
00:57:49.079 --> 00:57:51.535
M thinks of everything.

288
00:57:51.666 --> 00:57:55.034
Tell me, do the initials C and W
mean anything to you?


289
00:57:55.168 --> 00:58:01.917
C and W... yes. Carlos and Wilmsberg.
They are very big importers in Rio.


290
00:58:02.049 --> 00:58:05.051
A subsidiary of the Drax Group, I believe.

291
00:58:05.178 --> 00:58:07.799
They have a warehouse
on Carioca Avenue.


292
00:58:08.347 --> 00:58:10.386
I'd like to pay
it a discreet visit tonight.

293
00:58:10.515 --> 00:58:14.465
Tonight?
I think you may find that a little difficult.


294
00:58:14.936 --> 00:58:18.981
Difficult or not,
it's something we have to do.


295
00:58:19.733 --> 00:58:26.185
Meanwhile, how do you kill five hours
in Rio if you don't samba?


296
00:58:52.553 --> 00:58:54.795
There's the warehouse.

297
00:58:54.931 --> 00:58:56.970
And not a soul about.

298
00:58:57.141 --> 00:59:01.008
- I think there's a way round the back.
- Good thinking.


299
00:59:34.174 --> 00:59:36.213
This is it.

300
00:59:36.677 --> 00:59:39.843
Don't talk to any
strange men. I'll be back.

301
01:02:32.251 --> 01:02:33.330
Are you all right?

302
01:02:33.460 --> 01:02:36.711
Yes. But I'd rather dance with you.

303
01:02:36.839 --> 01:02:39.460
I did tell you
not to talk to any strange men.


304
01:02:41.092 --> 01:02:43.381
Did you find anything in there?

305
01:02:43.512 --> 01:02:45.551
Only this.

306
01:02:46.389 --> 01:02:48.298
"Drax Air Freight."

307
01:02:48.432 --> 01:02:53.094
- Know which airport they operate from?
- S? Pedro. Shall I take you there?


308
01:02:53.228 --> 01:02:55.719
No, I think you need some rest.

309
01:02:55.855 --> 01:02:57.895
Come on.

310
01:04:27.438 --> 01:04:29.561
Haven't we met before somewhere?

311
01:04:29.691 --> 01:04:31.730
The face is familiar.

312
01:04:31.859 --> 01:04:33.685
As is the manner.

313
01:04:34.403 --> 01:04:39.148
- It's become chilly since Venice.
- That was before you walked out on me.


314
01:04:39.282 --> 01:04:42.199
Nearly tripping over your suitcase
on the way out.


315
01:04:42.493 --> 01:04:43.573
So?

316
01:04:43.703 --> 01:04:47.321
So why waste time
working against each other?


317
01:04:47.456 --> 01:04:51.703
I've checked Drax's warehouse.
It's empty.


318
01:04:51.836 --> 01:04:56.081
No surprise. Since I arrived those planes
have been taking off every two hours.


319
01:04:56.214 --> 01:05:00.342
- Yes, he's moving out.
- Where to?


320
01:05:00.468 --> 01:05:04.595
That's what we're going to find out -
now that we're working together.


321
01:05:09.476 --> 01:05:12.311
I still don't know if I trust you.

322
01:05:12.438 --> 01:05:15.557
I don't know if I trust you either.

323
01:05:15.690 --> 01:05:19.141
That's what makes it more exciting.
