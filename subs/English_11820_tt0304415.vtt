1
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.087
All her life she had wanted
to teach at Wellesley College.


2
00:01:19.257 --> 00:01:22.283
So when a position opened
in the Art History department...


3
00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.191
...she pursued it single-mindedly
until she was hired.


4
00:01:31.903 --> 00:01:34.133
It was whispered
that Katherine Watson...


5
00:01:34.572 --> 00:01:36.836
...a first-year teacher
from Oakland State...


6
00:01:37.008 --> 00:01:40.239
...made up in brains
what she lacked in pedigree.


7
00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:53.351
Which was why this bohemian
from California...


8
00:01:53.525 --> 00:01:57.859
...was on her way to the most
conservative college in the nation.


9
00:01:58.029 --> 00:02:00.623
- Excuse me, please.
- Oh, sorry.


10
00:02:02.334 --> 00:02:03.995
Excuse me.

11
00:02:08.506 --> 00:02:10.337
Excuse me. The bus?

12
00:02:10.508 --> 00:02:12.203
- Keep walking, ma'am.
- Thank you.


13
00:02:12.377 --> 00:02:16.143
But Katherine Watson didn't come
to Wellesley to fit in.


14
00:02:16.681 --> 00:02:20.742
She came to Wellesley because
she wanted to make a difference.


15
00:02:20.919 --> 00:02:24.548
- Violet.
- My favorite Italian professor.


16
00:02:24.723 --> 00:02:26.691
- Nice summer?
- Terrific, thanks.


17
00:02:26.858 --> 00:02:29.019
- Who's that over there?
- Where?


18
00:02:29.194 --> 00:02:33.858
Oh, Katherine Watson. New teacher.
Art History. I'm dying to meet her.


19
00:03:35.293 --> 00:03:38.160
Who knocks at the Door of Learning?

20
00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:42.891
- I am every woman.
- What do you seek?


21
00:03:43.067 --> 00:03:45.661
To awaken my spirit
through hard work...


22
00:03:45.837 --> 00:03:48.101
...and dedicate my life
to knowledge.


23
00:03:48.273 --> 00:03:49.706
Then you are welcome.

24
00:03:49.874 --> 00:03:54.971
All women who seek to follow you
can enter here.


25
00:03:55.146 --> 00:03:59.879
I now declare
the academic year begun.


26
00:04:19.103 --> 00:04:23.631
A shame you didn't come yesterday.
It's so quiet before the girls arrive.


27
00:04:26.344 --> 00:04:29.711
Just a few rules.
No holes in the walls.


28
00:04:29.881 --> 00:04:34.511
No pets, no loud noises, no radio
or hi-fi after 8 on weekdays...


29
00:04:34.686 --> 00:04:36.381
...10 on weekends...

30
00:04:36.554 --> 00:04:40.012
...no hot plates and no male visitors.

31
00:04:42.427 --> 00:04:43.985
Anything wrong?

32
00:04:44.896 --> 00:04:48.457
I don't think I can go a year
without a hot plate.


33
00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.562
Don't you just love chintz?

34
00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.605
And look.

35
00:05:01.646 --> 00:05:03.443
They match.

36
00:05:03.615 --> 00:05:07.551
Sweet, right? Your room's here.

37
00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:11.746
My room is just across the way...

38
00:05:12.323 --> 00:05:15.019
...and Amanda Armstrong's
down the other end.


39
00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.322
- You grew up here?
- My whole life.


40
00:05:18.496 --> 00:05:22.330
You'll meet my parents
when they come to visit.


41
00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.799
- They visit?
- Regularly.


42
00:05:28.306 --> 00:05:33.972
- What do you teach?
- Speech, elocution and poise.


43
00:05:34.412 --> 00:05:36.846
Dinners are communal,
so I'll handle that.


44
00:05:37.015 --> 00:05:40.610
But breakfast and lunch,
you're on your own. So...


45
00:05:40.785 --> 00:05:45.848
...we each get our own shelf.
I'll make your label this evening.


46
00:05:46.291 --> 00:05:52.230
I don't need to tell you, everything on
our individual shelves is sacrosanct.


47
00:05:54.065 --> 00:05:57.728
I just knew when we met...

48
00:05:58.636 --> 00:06:01.036
...we'd be instant friends.

49
00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:23.752
Be careful. They can smell fear.

50
00:06:44.082 --> 00:06:46.915
- Good morning.
- Good morning.


51
00:06:47.251 --> 00:06:48.912
Thank you.

52
00:06:49.654 --> 00:06:54.523
This is History of Art 100.

53
00:06:55.093 --> 00:06:59.120
We'll be following
Dr. Staunton's syllabus.


54
00:06:59.297 --> 00:07:02.266
- Any questions so far?
- Your name?


55
00:07:03.267 --> 00:07:05.633
- Why don't you go first?
- Connie Baker.


56
00:07:05.803 --> 00:07:10.467
- Katherine Watson. Nice to meet you.
- Dr. Watson, I presume.


57
00:07:11.576 --> 00:07:14.807
- Not yet. And you are?
- Giselle Levy.


58
00:07:14.979 --> 00:07:17.539
Giselle. If someone could get the...

59
00:07:18.816 --> 00:07:22.752
- Susan Delacorte.
- Thank you, Susan Delacorte.


60
00:07:26.257 --> 00:07:31.194
From the beginning, man has always
had the impulse to create art.


61
00:07:31.362 --> 00:07:34.798
- Can anyone tell me what this is?
- Wounded Bison, Altamira, Spain...


62
00:07:34.966 --> 00:07:38.231
...about 15,000 B.C.
Joan Brandwyn.


63
00:07:38.703 --> 00:07:40.603
Very good, Joan.

64
00:07:40.972 --> 00:07:44.965
Despite the age of these, they are
technically sophisticated because...


65
00:07:45.143 --> 00:07:49.637
The shading and the thickness of the
lines moving over the bison's hump.


66
00:07:49.814 --> 00:07:53.750
- Is that right?
- Yes, that's exactly right.


67
00:07:54.519 --> 00:07:56.510
Next slide.

68
00:07:57.055 --> 00:08:01.116
This is probably less familiar.
It was discovered by archeologists...


69
00:08:01.292 --> 00:08:05.251
In 1879, Lascaux, France.
Dates back to 10,000 B.C.


70
00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:09.730
Singled out because of flowing lines
depicting the movement of the animal.


71
00:08:11.869 --> 00:08:14.599
- Impressive. Name?
- Herd of Horses.


72
00:08:14.772 --> 00:08:17.969
- I meant yours.
- We call her Flicka.


73
00:08:18.609 --> 00:08:21.373
Elizabeth Warren.
They call me Betty.


74
00:08:21.546 --> 00:08:23.138
Very good.

75
00:08:23.314 --> 00:08:25.976
Betty is also correct.

76
00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:30.052
Just because something is ancient
doesn't mean that it is primitive.


77
00:08:30.221 --> 00:08:32.451
For example. Next slide, please.

78
00:08:32.623 --> 00:08:35.114
Mycerinus and His Queen. 2470 B.C.

79
00:08:35.293 --> 00:08:37.784
It's a funerary statue
of the pharaoh and queen...


80
00:08:37.962 --> 00:08:42.262
...originally intended to preserve
the pharaoh's ka. Soul.


81
00:08:45.837 --> 00:08:48.772
Have any of you taken
Art History before?


82
00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:51.170
No.

83
00:08:53.911 --> 00:08:56.505
Let's go on. Slide.

84
00:08:56.881 --> 00:08:59.782
Seated Scribe. Egypt. 2400 B.C.

85
00:09:00.718 --> 00:09:04.347
Peasant Couple Plowing.
Sixteenth century B.C. Egypt.


86
00:09:04.989 --> 00:09:08.083
Snake Goddess.
Minoan. 1600 B.C.


87
00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:10.794
Fresco. Minoan. 1600 B.C.

88
00:09:11.696 --> 00:09:13.857
Funeral Mask. Mycenaean. 1200.

89
00:09:26.244 --> 00:09:27.609
Could someone please get...?

90
00:09:34.418 --> 00:09:36.079
Thank you.

91
00:09:37.622 --> 00:09:41.023
By a show of hands only...

92
00:09:41.859 --> 00:09:46.023
...how many of you have read
the entire text?


93
00:09:48.499 --> 00:09:53.869
- And the suggested supplements.
- Long way from Oakland State?


94
00:09:57.308 --> 00:09:59.742
Well, you girls do prepare.

95
00:09:59.911 --> 00:10:03.677
If you've nothing else for us,
we could go to independent study.


96
00:10:04.582 --> 00:10:06.209
Ac...

97
00:10:42.954 --> 00:10:49.086
I was in California once. How do you
get work done with all that sunshine?


98
00:10:49.427 --> 00:10:53.056
- We tan in class.
- Really?


99
00:10:53.331 --> 00:10:54.628
No.

100
00:10:58.936 --> 00:11:01.530
You know, not everybody
wanted you.


101
00:11:01.706 --> 00:11:04.197
I'm not naming any names.

102
00:11:04.375 --> 00:11:08.971
These jobs usually go quickly.
Ex-students, friends of, you know...


103
00:11:09.146 --> 00:11:11.478
...the right people.

104
00:11:11.649 --> 00:11:15.585
The person they wanted took a job at
Brown, and no one else was available.


105
00:11:15.753 --> 00:11:17.846
So here you are.

106
00:11:18.689 --> 00:11:22.489
You can go in now. Good luck.

107
00:11:28.499 --> 00:11:31.297
Your first class left a lot
to be desired, Miss Watson.


108
00:11:31.469 --> 00:11:35.132
And I'm curious about the subject
of your dissertation.


109
00:11:35.306 --> 00:11:40.243
You suggest, "Picasso will do
for the 20th century...


110
00:11:40.411 --> 00:11:44.370
...what Michelangelo did
for the Renaissance," unquote.


111
00:11:45.116 --> 00:11:47.584
In terms of influencing movements.

112
00:11:47.752 --> 00:11:50.949
So these canvases that
they're turning out these days...


113
00:11:51.122 --> 00:11:54.182
...with paint dripped
and splotched on them...


114
00:11:54.358 --> 00:11:59.318
...they're as worthy of our attention
as Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel?


115
00:11:59.864 --> 00:12:01.661
I'm not comparing them.

116
00:12:01.832 --> 00:12:05.461
Have you ever seen
the Sistine Chapel, Miss Watson?


117
00:12:05.636 --> 00:12:07.627
Actually stood there?

118
00:12:09.273 --> 00:12:11.138
I've never been to Europe.

119
00:12:14.412 --> 00:12:19.213
I can assure all of you this is the place
I want to be more than anything.


120
00:12:19.383 --> 00:12:23.877
Better discipline next class,
Miss Watson.


121
00:12:29.226 --> 00:12:31.456
- Hello.
- It's me.


122
00:12:31.963 --> 00:12:34.659
- Hey!
- Collect from Katherine Watson.


123
00:12:34.832 --> 00:12:38.393
- Will you accept?
- Yeah, sure, of course I will.


124
00:12:39.036 --> 00:12:41.231
Hey, is everything okay?

125
00:12:42.506 --> 00:12:43.495
Yeah.

126
00:12:44.809 --> 00:12:46.401
Tough, huh?

127
00:12:49.513 --> 00:12:52.004
Well, how are the classes?

128
00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:54.584
Snobs, right?

129
00:12:55.886 --> 00:12:59.982
- I hate to say I told you so.
- You don't have to.


130
00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:08.657
I can't really talk right now.

131
00:13:09.867 --> 00:13:11.801
I'll write you tonight.

132
00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:17.430
So you got a fella?

133
00:13:18.909 --> 00:13:22.140
He's... He's there. I'm here.

134
00:13:22.313 --> 00:13:27.774
Long distance. Torture. I know.
Come. Come in and sit down.


135
00:13:31.455 --> 00:13:35.619
When Lenny left for the South Pacific,
it nearly broke my heart.


136
00:13:35.793 --> 00:13:38.523
We wrote every day until...

137
00:13:41.198 --> 00:13:43.291
He was a great man.

138
00:13:44.101 --> 00:13:47.036
- I'm sorry.
- It was a hundred years ago.


139
00:13:47.204 --> 00:13:49.001
I'm babbling.

140
00:13:51.242 --> 00:13:56.270
I love Lucy.
Even if she is a communist.


141
00:13:56.447 --> 00:13:59.314
The only thing red about Lucy
is her hair.


142
00:13:59.483 --> 00:14:01.951
And even that's fake. Desi said it.

143
00:14:02.119 --> 00:14:04.053
Winchell wrote it.

144
00:14:04.822 --> 00:14:07.757
Amanda Armstrong.
I see you survived.


145
00:14:07.925 --> 00:14:09.790
Katherine Watson. Just barely.

146
00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:13.088
Oh, good. You've met.
Katherine's taken the third bedroom.


147
00:14:13.264 --> 00:14:16.256
How about a little dinner
before What's My Line?


148
00:14:17.301 --> 00:14:19.826
How about a little drink?

149
00:14:22.206 --> 00:14:25.039
Her companion died in May.

150
00:14:25.576 --> 00:14:26.907
Companion?

151
00:14:27.745 --> 00:14:30.111
You know, companion.

152
00:14:31.248 --> 00:14:37.244
Josephine Burns.
Taught biology here for 30 years.


153
00:14:40.624 --> 00:14:43.752
You'll love it here, Katherine.
You'll see.


154
00:14:43.928 --> 00:14:48.865
I already do. I... Honestly,
it's beautiful. It's perfect, really.


155
00:14:49.033 --> 00:14:53.595
Well, don't fool yourself. They have
claws underneath their white gloves.


156
00:14:54.905 --> 00:14:56.372
Who?

157
00:14:57.174 --> 00:15:01.702
The alumnae, their offspring,
the faculty. You name it.


158
00:15:02.079 --> 00:15:03.876
Watch out for yourself.

159
00:15:04.048 --> 00:15:06.107
Too much independence
frightens them.


160
00:15:06.283 --> 00:15:10.049
- Will you please stop?
- Oh, a word of advice.


161
00:15:10.221 --> 00:15:13.622
Don't let those girls
know that they got to you.


162
00:15:16.127 --> 00:15:19.187
- They didn't.
- Good for you.


163
00:15:20.664 --> 00:15:22.928
You almost convinced me.

164
00:15:53.264 --> 00:15:56.199
- What is that?
- You tell me.


165
00:15:59.637 --> 00:16:03.471
Carcass by Soutine. 1925.

166
00:16:04.408 --> 00:16:07.900
- It's not on the syllabus.
- No, it's not.


167
00:16:09.914 --> 00:16:12.178
Is it any good?

168
00:16:17.421 --> 00:16:22.051
Come on, ladies.
There's no wrong answer.


169
00:16:22.226 --> 00:16:25.718
There's also no textbook
telling you what to think.


170
00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:28.789
It's not that easy, is it?

171
00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:32.232
All right. No. 
It's not good.

172
00:16:32.403 --> 00:16:35.201
In fact, I wouldn't even call it art.
It's grotesque.


173
00:16:35.406 --> 00:16:37.271
Is there a rule against
grotesque art?


174
00:16:37.474 --> 00:16:40.932
I think there's something
aggressive about it...


175
00:16:41.679 --> 00:16:44.842
...and erotic.
- To you, everything is erotic.


176
00:16:45.015 --> 00:16:47.415
- Everything is erotic.
- Girls.


177
00:16:47.585 --> 00:16:49.815
- Aren't there standards?
- Of course.


178
00:16:49.987 --> 00:16:53.354
Otherwise a tacky velvet painting
could be equated to a Rembrandt.


179
00:16:53.524 --> 00:16:57.722
My Uncle Ferdie has two tacky velvet
paintings. He loves those clowns.


180
00:16:57.895 --> 00:17:03.629
There are standards, technique,
composition, color, even subject.


181
00:17:03.801 --> 00:17:06.793
So if you're suggesting
that rotted side of meat is art...


182
00:17:06.971 --> 00:17:10.134
...much less good art,
then what are we going to learn?


183
00:17:11.308 --> 00:17:12.866
Just that.

184
00:17:13.043 --> 00:17:16.604
You have outlined our new syllabus,
Betty. Thank you.


185
00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:19.681
What is art?
What makes it good or bad?


186
00:17:19.850 --> 00:17:21.818
And who decides?

187
00:17:22.786 --> 00:17:24.253
Next slide, please.

188
00:17:26.290 --> 00:17:29.350
Twenty-five years ago someone
thought this was brilliant.


189
00:17:29.526 --> 00:17:31.790
- I can see that.
- Who?


190
00:17:31.962 --> 00:17:35.489
My mother. I painted it
for her birthday.


191
00:17:35.666 --> 00:17:39.864
Next slide. This is my mom.

192
00:17:40.471 --> 00:17:43.770
- Is it art?
- It's a snapshot.


193
00:17:43.941 --> 00:17:47.877
If I told you Ansel Adams had taken it,
would that make a difference?


194
00:17:48.946 --> 00:17:53.349
- Art isn't art until someone says it is.
- It's art!


195
00:17:54.618 --> 00:17:57.348
- The right people.
- Who are they?


196
00:17:57.554 --> 00:17:58.919
Betty Warren!

197
00:17:59.089 --> 00:18:02.650
- We're lucky we have one right here.
- Screw you.


198
00:18:04.461 --> 00:18:06.827
Could you go back
to the Soutine, please?


199
00:18:09.166 --> 00:18:13.193
Just look at it again.
Look beyond the paint.


200
00:18:13.370 --> 00:18:18.239
Let us try to open our minds
to a new idea.


201
00:18:21.178 --> 00:18:25.239
All right, back to chapter three.
Has anyone read it?


202
00:18:27.518 --> 00:18:28.542
Okay.

203
00:18:31.955 --> 00:18:34.890
"When your courses are set,
and a dream boat you've met...


204
00:18:35.059 --> 00:18:37.084
...have a real cigarette.
Have a Camel."


205
00:18:37.261 --> 00:18:41.288
I've got my courses, I've got my Camel
cigarette. Where is my dream boat?


206
00:18:41.465 --> 00:18:44.992
- Giselle, where is my dream boat?
- Betty's cousin isn't good enough?


207
00:18:45.169 --> 00:18:47.194
- I haven't met him.
- Don't encourage her.


208
00:18:47.371 --> 00:18:49.931
He's only escorting
Connie as a favor.


209
00:18:50.107 --> 00:18:52.041
Why are you like this?

210
00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:54.803
I didn't mean that.

211
00:18:54.978 --> 00:18:57.640
I'm just under so much pressure
with the wedding.


212
00:18:57.815 --> 00:19:00.784
Do you realize November 2
is three weeks from now?


213
00:19:00.951 --> 00:19:02.885
- Oh, honey.
- Don't have it.


214
00:19:03.053 --> 00:19:04.680
- Don't come.
- Here. Here.


215
00:19:04.855 --> 00:19:08.052
I'm working on table seating now,
so I can just erase your name.


216
00:19:08.225 --> 00:19:09.487
- Can I see it?
- No.


217
00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:11.685
Let me look.
I can't look for a second?


218
00:19:11.862 --> 00:19:15.263
- You want to see where Bill is sitting.
- No. That is over. Right?


219
00:19:15.432 --> 00:19:18.094
Right? Giselle, right?

220
00:19:20.104 --> 00:19:21.628
Damn it.

221
00:19:27.678 --> 00:19:31.136
- Do I look a little bit like her?
- Like who?


222
00:19:31.648 --> 00:19:35.106
- Katherine Watson.
- You mean, "crap is art"?


223
00:19:35.853 --> 00:19:40.119
- I think she's fabulous.
- Well, no man wanted her.


224
00:19:41.525 --> 00:19:43.686
- She isn't dead.
- She's at least 30.


225
00:19:43.861 --> 00:19:46.921
- Oh, no. No.
- I guess she never wanted children.


226
00:19:47.097 --> 00:19:49.031
For your information...

227
00:19:49.199 --> 00:19:55.229
...Katherine Watson had to take
this job to escape from California.


228
00:19:55.939 --> 00:19:57.201
Please.

229
00:19:57.374 --> 00:20:01.276
She had a torrid affair
with a Hollywood movie star.


230
00:20:01.445 --> 00:20:05.779
- She came here to get away.
- That's ridiculous.


231
00:20:05.949 --> 00:20:08.679
- Who was it?
- I don't know.


232
00:20:09.153 --> 00:20:11.747
Who was it, Giselle?
Don't be a pimple! Tell me!


233
00:20:11.922 --> 00:20:14.618
- It's ridiculous.
- Tell me. No, it's not. You know.


234
00:20:14.792 --> 00:20:18.421
- You know something. Tell me.
- It's William Holden.


235
00:20:19.897 --> 00:20:21.626
- Fantastic!
- I know.


236
00:20:21.799 --> 00:20:23.426
Who is it?

237
00:20:24.334 --> 00:20:26.802
William Holden.

238
00:20:35.345 --> 00:20:39.509
I know. I know. I'm late. I'm... Abject
pleading, apologies, forgiveness.


239
00:20:39.817 --> 00:20:41.341
Is she giving you any trouble?

240
00:20:41.518 --> 00:20:45.215
If these girls can't get back on time,
know what I say? Lock them out.


241
00:20:45.956 --> 00:20:50.916
Come on. Out! I'm going
to lock the door. Out!


242
00:20:51.195 --> 00:20:56.497
Bedtime, ladies. Bedtime.
Let's go. Bedtime.


243
00:20:57.067 --> 00:20:59.194
- Hey, Betty.
- Quiet time, ladies.


244
00:20:59.369 --> 00:21:01.803
Women like Katherine Watson
don't get married...


245
00:21:01.972 --> 00:21:04.998
...because they choose not to.
- No woman chooses to live...


246
00:21:05.175 --> 00:21:08.611
...without a home, unless she's
sleeping with her Italian professor.


247
00:21:08.779 --> 00:21:10.940
- You are so critical.
- I am not.


248
00:21:11.114 --> 00:21:13.605
Of course you are.
You're your mother's daughter.


249
00:21:13.784 --> 00:21:15.547
It's a classic Electra complex.

250
00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:18.317
I don't blame you. I mean...

251
00:21:18.489 --> 00:21:20.650
...who wouldn't want
to murder your mother?


252
00:21:20.824 --> 00:21:24.021
- Hey. How's the Harvard sweetheart?
- Divine.


253
00:21:24.194 --> 00:21:26.287
Got an extra ciggie?

254
00:21:26.463 --> 00:21:28.294
- Did you do his homework?
- Of course.


255
00:21:28.465 --> 00:21:31.434
- Want to do mine?
- No.


256
00:21:34.037 --> 00:21:38.497
This isn't what I
think it is. Is it?

257
00:21:40.811 --> 00:21:42.073
Where'd you get it?

258
00:21:44.581 --> 00:21:46.310
From the school nurse.

259
00:21:47.150 --> 00:21:51.883
- It's against the law.
- Oh, honey. It's a girl's best friend.


260
00:21:52.055 --> 00:21:56.549
- A certain kind of girl.
- Meet the last virgin bride.


261
00:21:57.895 --> 00:22:01.956
- Spencer is a gentleman.
- And even gentlemen have dicks.


262
00:22:06.203 --> 00:22:09.195
- Maybe I'll get one.
- What? A dick?


263
00:22:09.373 --> 00:22:11.603
Don't be stupid, Connie.

264
00:22:14.478 --> 00:22:17.470
Someone, somewhere,
someday might be interested.


265
00:22:18.749 --> 00:22:22.776
Just in case.
Just in case, I'll be prepared.


266
00:22:26.256 --> 00:22:28.247
Was that necessary?

267
00:22:28.425 --> 00:22:30.689
I was taught it's best
to speak honestly.


268
00:22:30.861 --> 00:22:33.728
Okay. You're a bitch.

269
00:22:40.771 --> 00:22:43.433
We recently learned
that Amanda Armstrong...


270
00:22:43.607 --> 00:22:48.567
...our nurse, has been distributing
contraception to Wellesley girls.


271
00:22:48.745 --> 00:22:51.509
This revelation is disturbing
to an institution...


272
00:22:51.682 --> 00:22:54.310
...that prides itself on propriety.

273
00:23:05.195 --> 00:23:10.360
Go, go, go! Go, go!
It's been going on since the late '80s.


274
00:23:10.534 --> 00:23:14.265
- Whoever wins is first to marry!
- Do the girls take it literally?


275
00:23:14.438 --> 00:23:19.273
Only the girl with the winning hoop.
Oh, look, it's Phyllis Nayor!


276
00:23:21.745 --> 00:23:26.341
Good for her. It gets me every time.

277
00:23:26.516 --> 00:23:29.110
- Why the buggies?
- They've got their man.


278
00:23:29.286 --> 00:23:31.777
They're wishing for their babies.

279
00:23:35.792 --> 00:23:37.919
Have you seen this?

280
00:23:39.062 --> 00:23:40.495
What is it?

281
00:23:41.264 --> 00:23:45.894
It's a front-page attack on Amanda
Armstrong. Betty Warren wrote it.


282
00:23:52.576 --> 00:23:55.545
"By providing contraception
on demand, our school nurse...


283
00:23:55.712 --> 00:23:58.772
...is little more than a cheerleader
for promiscuity." Wow.


284
00:23:58.949 --> 00:24:02.248
Oh, they're not going to dump her
in a lake!


285
00:24:04.454 --> 00:24:06.649
- I'm coming, Phyllis!
- Have you seen this?


286
00:24:06.823 --> 00:24:10.020
I wouldn't worry. Betty's just
a young girl flexing her muscles.


287
00:24:10.193 --> 00:24:12.991
So was Lizzie Borden,
and her mother wasn't president...


288
00:24:13.163 --> 00:24:16.929
...of the alumnae association.
- Would somebody get that girl a towel!


289
00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:20.194
- That's her mother?
- Apple, tree.


290
00:24:20.370 --> 00:24:22.531
Is Amanda going to get into trouble?

291
00:24:22.706 --> 00:24:25.573
Amanda needs to start
minding her p's and q's.


292
00:24:25.742 --> 00:24:28.677
The trick to surviving Wellesley
is never getting noticed.


293
00:24:28.845 --> 00:24:30.904
Ciao, Mona Lisa.

294
00:24:31.615 --> 00:24:34.015
The big war hero.

295
00:24:34.184 --> 00:24:36.652
He thinks he's something special.

296
00:24:37.854 --> 00:24:40.584
He sleeps with his students.

297
00:24:42.893 --> 00:24:45.259
The gold is fine.
The napkin rings are vulgar.


298
00:24:45.429 --> 00:24:47.727
The glassware should be trimmed
with gold.


299
00:24:47.898 --> 00:24:52.358
The little sugar boxes, gold and white,
filled with chocolate. No candlesticks.


300
00:24:52.536 --> 00:24:55.403
- Freesia instead of daisies.
- Wise choice, madam.


301
00:24:56.740 --> 00:24:58.173
No baby's breath.

302
00:25:03.447 --> 00:25:06.780
- You already had your fitting?
- We're on our way.


303
00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:10.511
Here's the seating chart
and Spencer's list of groomsmen.


304
00:25:10.687 --> 00:25:12.746
Oh, I almost forgot.

305
00:25:13.123 --> 00:25:17.457
I spoke to him about reading the
poem. He'd rather not. I said all right.


306
00:25:19.096 --> 00:25:21.564
Excuse us for a second, Joan.

307
00:25:26.903 --> 00:25:30.236
A good wife lets her husband
think that everything's his idea...


308
00:25:30.407 --> 00:25:33.069
...even when it's not.
- I don't care if he reads it.


309
00:25:33.243 --> 00:25:35.302
You will in retrospect.

310
00:25:36.613 --> 00:25:42.017
Now, why don't you see if you
can't nudge the idea into his head.


311
00:25:47.290 --> 00:25:51.158
I've been here now
for 21 years, Jocelyn.


312
00:25:51.328 --> 00:25:54.456
- I remember you as a student.
- Twenty-four, if you count that.


313
00:25:54.631 --> 00:25:56.656
So why the theatrics?

314
00:25:57.100 --> 00:26:01.264
We cannot appear
to promote sexual promiscuity.


315
00:26:01.438 --> 00:26:04.805
Okay. It's about appearances, then?
No.


316
00:26:04.975 --> 00:26:07.239
All right, all right.

317
00:26:07.410 --> 00:26:12.279
All right. Well, I promise not to appear
to be sympathetic, progressive...


318
00:26:12.449 --> 00:26:16.078
...or what did Mrs. Warren
call it? "Liberal."


319
00:26:16.653 --> 00:26:18.518
Scout's honor.

320
00:26:19.956 --> 00:26:23.392
I spent the better part of Friday
afternoon convincing the alumnae...


321
00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:25.460
...that your record was impeccable...

322
00:26:25.629 --> 00:26:29.861
...that you would no longer
provide contraceptive devices...


323
00:26:30.033 --> 00:26:32.695
...and you'd make
a public statement to that effect.


324
00:26:32.869 --> 00:26:34.996
I'm not willing to make
a public statement.


325
00:26:35.172 --> 00:26:37.504
It doesn't matter, Amanda.

326
00:26:39.976 --> 00:26:42.035
They're letting you go.

327
00:26:45.315 --> 00:26:47.510
It's out of my hands.

328
00:26:50.821 --> 00:26:53.119
And this champagne cup
is in the wrong place.


329
00:26:53.290 --> 00:26:56.953
And up and down. And up and...

330
00:26:57.127 --> 00:26:59.652
Katherine. Good evening,
Miss Watson.


331
00:26:59.830 --> 00:27:02.162
- Good evening, Miss Watson.
- Join us.


332
00:27:06.102 --> 00:27:07.433
No.

333
00:27:07.604 --> 00:27:10.129
- Good night, Miss Watson.
- Good night, Miss Watson.


334
00:27:10.307 --> 00:27:12.537
And down. Very nice. Very nice.

335
00:27:28.525 --> 00:27:29.992
Hey.

336
00:27:31.795 --> 00:27:35.196
Heard about Amanda. I'm sorry.

337
00:27:35.365 --> 00:27:38.425
She seemed all right about it.
I wouldn't be.


338
00:27:38.602 --> 00:27:41.036
They don't give you
too many chances around here.


339
00:27:41.204 --> 00:27:44.105
Oh, that depends how much
they hate you to begin with.


340
00:27:46.076 --> 00:27:48.567
Can I buy you a drink?
Or are you here for dinner?


341
00:27:48.745 --> 00:27:51.145
How long do
the marriage lectures take?


342
00:27:51.314 --> 00:27:53.475
Get this woman a booth.

343
00:28:08.164 --> 00:28:11.395
Your husband is at a crossroads
in his career.


344
00:28:12.269 --> 00:28:18.606
He's competing for promotion
against two rivals, Smith and Jones.


345
00:28:19.643 --> 00:28:24.273
To get the edge, you have wisely
decided to invite the boss...


346
00:28:24.447 --> 00:28:27.473
...and his wife to a 7:00 dinner.

347
00:28:27.651 --> 00:28:30.381
You've carefully planned
your meal...


348
00:28:30.553 --> 00:28:33.852
...set your table
and arranged for a babysitter.


349
00:28:34.024 --> 00:28:36.993
- Oh, we have babies!
- Yes, and I have twins!


350
00:28:39.029 --> 00:28:41.793
Then, surprise. It's 6:15...

351
00:28:41.965 --> 00:28:46.493
...and your husband's called to say
that Smith, Jones and their wives...


352
00:28:46.670 --> 00:28:49.298
...have been invited
at the boss's request.


353
00:28:54.010 --> 00:28:55.568
Ever the Wellesley girl...

354
00:28:55.745 --> 00:28:58.270
...you keep your cool
and understand...


355
00:28:58.448 --> 00:29:02.908
...that the boss is probably testing you
as much as your husband. What next?


356
00:29:03.086 --> 00:29:06.146
- Yes?
- File for divorce?


357
00:29:08.558 --> 00:29:10.992
That's very funny.

358
00:29:11.161 --> 00:29:14.062
But the thing is, it's not a joke.

359
00:29:14.731 --> 00:29:17.291
A few years from now
your sole responsibility...


360
00:29:17.467 --> 00:29:20.994
...will be taking care
of your husband and children.


361
00:29:23.974 --> 00:29:26.909
You may all be here...

362
00:29:27.077 --> 00:29:29.136
...for an easy A...

363
00:29:29.312 --> 00:29:34.375
...but the grade that matters the most
is the one he gives you, not me.


364
00:29:35.118 --> 00:29:38.212
- You'll need to...
- Whatever you do...


365
00:29:38.388 --> 00:29:40.822
...don't put the boss's wife
next to your husband.


366
00:29:40.991 --> 00:29:44.722
- Why not?
- She's screwing him.


367
00:29:46.029 --> 00:29:49.465
Is that where you learned
to speak Italian? In Italy?


368
00:29:49.632 --> 00:29:51.099
Yeah.

369
00:29:53.837 --> 00:29:57.000
- Have you got a boyfriend?
- Yes.


370
00:29:59.309 --> 00:30:01.743
You know, if you were mine,
I'd never let you go.


371
00:30:01.911 --> 00:30:04.277
I wouldn't have asked
your permission.


372
00:30:06.349 --> 00:30:08.510
Yeah, they say you're progressive.

373
00:30:09.019 --> 00:30:10.816
A forward thinker.

374
00:30:11.721 --> 00:30:14.451
- Are you?
- There are a lot of labels here...


375
00:30:14.891 --> 00:30:16.358
...l've noticed.

376
00:30:16.526 --> 00:30:22.362
Right family, right school, right art,
right way of thinking.


377
00:30:22.832 --> 00:30:25.357
Well, saves the effort
on thinking for yourself.


378
00:30:26.536 --> 00:30:29.972
How do you expect to ever make
a difference if everything is a joke?


379
00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:35.070
Oh, Katherine Watson comes to
Wellesley to set us all free? Come on.


380
00:30:37.313 --> 00:30:41.579
- Thank you for the drink.
- No, no. Wait. I was teasing.


381
00:30:42.385 --> 00:30:44.819
They have their own way
of doing things here.


382
00:30:45.121 --> 00:30:49.455
You've just gotta find a way
to work with them. We all had to.


383
00:31:01.004 --> 00:31:02.869
I'm sorry.

384
00:31:04.941 --> 00:31:08.104
Five years ago,
they'd have slapped my wrist.


385
00:31:08.278 --> 00:31:12.408
But now there's a committee
for the protection of everything.


386
00:31:14.250 --> 00:31:16.081
They think you're dangerous?

387
00:31:16.252 --> 00:31:20.450
Oh, no, darling. No. Subversive.

388
00:31:22.592 --> 00:31:23.991
It's gotten to the point...

389
00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:27.561
...where you don't know
who is protecting whom from what.


390
00:31:28.231 --> 00:31:34.693
Or should that be "from whom"?
Well, whom gives a damn anyway?


391
00:31:35.238 --> 00:31:37.934
They're doing me a favor really.

392
00:31:40.243 --> 00:31:41.938
Will you be all right?

393
00:31:45.515 --> 00:31:47.449
Better than that.

394
00:31:51.621 --> 00:31:56.285
I should really have left
when Josephine died.


395
00:31:59.329 --> 00:32:02.662
Nothing left to love
here anymore. So...


396
00:32:17.147 --> 00:32:19.081
Hello?

397
00:32:20.316 --> 00:32:23.217
- Miss Watson?
- Yes. I'm back here.


398
00:32:24.821 --> 00:32:29.349
I've never been to this part
of campus before. Where are we?


399
00:32:30.193 --> 00:32:34.425
No man's land. So to speak.

400
00:32:37.233 --> 00:32:38.962
Come on in.

401
00:32:39.769 --> 00:32:41.396
What's all this?

402
00:32:42.105 --> 00:32:44.266
Different things different days.

403
00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:50.811
People who inspire me,
artists I admire, editorials I don't.


404
00:32:51.114 --> 00:32:54.413
So you came to see me.

405
00:32:55.285 --> 00:32:58.277
- You gave me a C.
- I'm kind.


406
00:32:58.655 --> 00:33:01.453
The assignment was to write
about Bruegel. I did that.


407
00:33:01.925 --> 00:33:05.452
- No, what you did was copy Strauss.
- I was referencing an expert.


408
00:33:05.995 --> 00:33:09.624
If I wanted to know what he thought,
I'd buy his book.


409
00:33:13.102 --> 00:33:15.798
Miss Watson, with all due respect...

410
00:33:17.607 --> 00:33:19.871
Bruegel was a storyteller.
Find the stories.


411
00:33:20.043 --> 00:33:24.104
Break them down into smaller pieces.
You might actually enjoy it.


412
00:33:25.081 --> 00:33:29.074
- You're giving me another chance?
- So it seems.


413
00:33:31.187 --> 00:33:34.213
Is that my file? 
What's it say?

414
00:33:36.292 --> 00:33:38.055
Well, let's see.

415
00:33:39.662 --> 00:33:42.756
- Straight A's.
- Until now.


416
00:33:44.033 --> 00:33:47.696
President of the poetry society,
captain of the debate team...


417
00:33:47.870 --> 00:33:51.567
...co-captain of the tennis club,
founder of the horticulture league.


418
00:33:51.741 --> 00:33:56.178
- I sound like a pompous ass.
- Yes, you do, but a very busy one.


419
00:33:56.346 --> 00:34:01.181
And it says here that you're pre-law.
What law school are you gonna go to?


420
00:34:01.351 --> 00:34:05.117
I hadn't thought about that.
After I graduate, I'm getting married.


421
00:34:05.288 --> 00:34:09.088
- And then?
- And then I'll be married.


422
00:34:09.892 --> 00:34:11.189
You can do both.

423
00:34:11.494 --> 00:34:16.295
Just for fun, if you could go
to any law school, which would it be?


424
00:34:17.066 --> 00:34:18.658
Yale.

425
00:34:19.369 --> 00:34:20.563
Yale.

426
00:34:20.737 --> 00:34:25.640
They keep five slots open for women,
one unofficially for a Wellesley girl.


427
00:34:25.808 --> 00:34:28.641
But you haven't really
thought about it.


428
00:34:46.229 --> 00:34:50.632
Wake up, Joanie, wake up.
Wake up.


429
00:34:51.567 --> 00:34:52.898
Okay, don't get up.

430
00:34:53.069 --> 00:34:55.970
Don't hear what I have to say
about Tommy and Spencer...


431
00:34:56.139 --> 00:34:59.404
...looking at an engagement ring...

432
00:34:59.575 --> 00:35:01.008
...for you.

433
00:35:02.745 --> 00:35:04.235
You're sure?

434
00:35:04.414 --> 00:35:06.644
That's everything
we always wanted, huh?


435
00:35:06.816 --> 00:35:10.274
We'll be best friends, and our
husbands will be best friends...


436
00:35:10.453 --> 00:35:13.820
...and we'll have houses together
and we'll have babies together...


437
00:35:13.990 --> 00:35:16.083
...and they'll be best friends.

438
00:35:16.259 --> 00:35:19.285
You're going to be
Mrs. Tommy Donegal.


439
00:35:19.662 --> 00:35:20.754
When?

440
00:35:20.930 --> 00:35:25.230
I'll get the scoop tomorrow.
You go back to sleep.


441
00:35:26.235 --> 00:35:30.194
The first part of the exam
will consist of two pairs of slides.


442
00:35:30.373 --> 00:35:34.469
Please identify each of the slides
by name, period and date.


443
00:35:34.644 --> 00:35:36.612
Then compare and contrast them.

444
00:35:36.779 --> 00:35:39.145
You will have 10 minutes
for each pair.


445
00:35:39.315 --> 00:35:41.681
Then you will write
a 1500-word essay...


446
00:35:41.851 --> 00:35:46.185
...describing the stylistic differences
between Raphael and van Eyck.


447
00:35:46.756 --> 00:35:49.020
Eyes forward, Miss Delacorte.

448
00:35:49.792 --> 00:35:51.919
You have 40 minutes.

449
00:35:52.095 --> 00:35:53.585
Good luck.

450
00:36:10.446 --> 00:36:12.812
- Excuse me.
- Governor. Another shot, please.


451
00:36:15.518 --> 00:36:17.884
This way, please. Thank you.

452
00:36:37.340 --> 00:36:38.705
Excuse me.

453
00:36:45.314 --> 00:36:47.714
This is quite the event.

454
00:36:47.884 --> 00:36:51.820
- I'm surprised I was invited.
- Well, look around you.


455
00:36:51.988 --> 00:36:53.615
Who wasn't?

456
00:36:58.294 --> 00:37:01.286
You ever hear the expression
"Keeping up with the Joneses"?


457
00:37:01.464 --> 00:37:02.692
Of course.

458
00:37:02.865 --> 00:37:04.628
Mr. And Mrs. Gordon Jones.

459
00:37:04.801 --> 00:37:09.033
The actual, historical family
they invented the phrase about.


460
00:37:11.474 --> 00:37:13.101
Good to know.

461
00:37:35.965 --> 00:37:37.262
That's him!

462
00:38:20.877 --> 00:38:23.971
- Thank you.
- Good to see you.


463
00:38:25.147 --> 00:38:27.877
- Thank you very much.
- A beautiful dress.


464
00:38:28.050 --> 00:38:30.416
Hi, we're so glad you came.

465
00:38:30.586 --> 00:38:33.248
- We're together. Table 19.
- Good.


466
00:38:35.024 --> 00:38:36.992
Holy God!

467
00:38:37.159 --> 00:38:40.856
The governor is right behind you.
Don't turn around.


468
00:38:44.033 --> 00:38:45.728
Great band.

469
00:38:48.671 --> 00:38:50.195
- Violet.
- Yes?


470
00:38:50.373 --> 00:38:52.534
- Would you mind if I go here?
- Not at all.


471
00:38:52.708 --> 00:38:54.403
Over here. Thank you.

472
00:38:57.113 --> 00:39:00.446
- Great band.
- Great band.


473
00:39:00.783 --> 00:39:03.251
- Hi, Katherine.
- Hi, Professor Dunbar.


474
00:39:06.589 --> 00:39:08.523
I'm getting a Manhattan.
Like anything?


475
00:39:08.691 --> 00:39:10.420
No, thank you.

476
00:39:10.593 --> 00:39:12.857
I'll take a Jack and ginger.

477
00:39:15.932 --> 00:39:18.093
He's making his move.

478
00:39:20.469 --> 00:39:22.937
I knew he'd go for her.

479
00:39:23.105 --> 00:39:25.505
She's too old for him.

480
00:39:25.675 --> 00:39:27.905
She's too smart for him.

481
00:39:28.077 --> 00:39:29.339
Hold that.

482
00:39:41.057 --> 00:39:43.116
- They're playing our song.
- What?


483
00:39:43.292 --> 00:39:46.557
- They're playing our song.
- I heard you.


484
00:39:46.729 --> 00:39:49.755
- Hi.
- Hi, Giselle.


485
00:39:52.401 --> 00:39:54.266
- Ladies' choice?
- Sure.


486
00:39:55.571 --> 00:39:57.163
Excuse me.

487
00:40:05.448 --> 00:40:09.043
Ladies, gentlemen! Quiet!

488
00:40:09.819 --> 00:40:12.310
What's this about the poem
you wanted me to read?


489
00:40:12.488 --> 00:40:15.480
- It was your idea, remember?
- I never said that.


490
00:40:15.658 --> 00:40:17.182
Ready?

491
00:40:18.995 --> 00:40:19.984
Excellent.

492
00:40:20.830 --> 00:40:25.267
Well, I wrote this down, just in case
you forgot. It's my favorite.


493
00:40:26.002 --> 00:40:27.560
Smile.

494
00:40:33.643 --> 00:40:38.342
Now, Betty, I tried to think of
a million ways to tell you how I feel.


495
00:40:38.514 --> 00:40:40.607
But instead...

496
00:40:41.384 --> 00:40:44.080
...I refer to your favorite poem.

497
00:40:53.863 --> 00:40:56.627
- Good catch.
- You said it.


498
00:40:58.868 --> 00:41:01.029
He's a morsel. Miss Watson!

499
00:41:01.203 --> 00:41:03.899
- He's a favor. Remember?
- Come on.


500
00:41:04.073 --> 00:41:07.065
Miss Watson,
I want you to meet Tommy.


501
00:41:07.243 --> 00:41:09.370
Tommy, come here for a second.

502
00:41:10.913 --> 00:41:13.507
You are so beautiful.

503
00:41:14.083 --> 00:41:17.849
- This is Katherine Watson.
- Oh, wow! In the flesh.


504
00:41:18.020 --> 00:41:21.717
- She has not shut up about you.
- Oh, stop.


505
00:41:21.891 --> 00:41:24.485
- You know what I'm saying?
- I do.


506
00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:28.391
- You did something to impress her.
- Well, it seems you did too.


507
00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:35.660
- You make these especially well.
- Thank you.


508
00:41:36.405 --> 00:41:39.238
I had a fella. Lenny.

509
00:41:40.309 --> 00:41:44.871
You remind me of him so much.

510
00:41:46.382 --> 00:41:48.145
He had this...

511
00:41:48.718 --> 00:41:51.778
...funny little thing
where his two front teeth...


512
00:41:51.954 --> 00:41:54.013
...they overlapped.

513
00:41:56.826 --> 00:41:58.453
He's dead.

514
00:42:01.330 --> 00:42:02.888
South Pacific.

515
00:42:22.918 --> 00:42:26.046
My parents say my future
is right on the horizon.


516
00:42:26.222 --> 00:42:28.588
Tell them the horizon
is an imaginary line...


517
00:42:28.758 --> 00:42:30.817
...that recedes as you approach it.

518
00:42:33.629 --> 00:42:36.189
I think I'll go back to my seat.

519
00:42:36.365 --> 00:42:39.391
I had a really nice time. Thank you.

520
00:42:40.870 --> 00:42:42.201
Connie.

521
00:42:43.172 --> 00:42:46.005
- Is this the brushoff?
- No.


522
00:42:46.175 --> 00:42:48.541
I thought you were, you know...

523
00:42:48.711 --> 00:42:50.679
...done with me.

524
00:42:52.114 --> 00:42:56.551
- Why would you think that?
- Betty said that you...


525
00:42:56.719 --> 00:43:02.123
I don't wanna take advantage.
I know that this was some favor.


526
00:43:02.291 --> 00:43:05.556
She did me the favor, not you.

527
00:43:06.495 --> 00:43:08.656
Come on, dance with me.

528
00:43:38.727 --> 00:43:41.025
She's too good for you.

529
00:43:42.631 --> 00:43:44.360
Maybe you're right.

530
00:43:45.935 --> 00:43:48.802
I'm too good for you too.

531
00:43:49.738 --> 00:43:54.801
- But I have lower expectations.
- I thought we settled this last spring.


532
00:43:55.177 --> 00:43:59.546
So then we probably shouldn't have
slept together over the summer.


533
00:43:59.882 --> 00:44:01.372
Stop.

534
00:44:04.854 --> 00:44:06.378
You ready?

535
00:44:06.789 --> 00:44:09.724
Do you wanna know something funny?

536
00:44:09.892 --> 00:44:12.452
Lenny's not dead.

537
00:44:12.928 --> 00:44:15.590
Not technically.

538
00:44:15.764 --> 00:44:17.061
He...

539
00:44:17.233 --> 00:44:18.723
He's got married.

540
00:44:18.901 --> 00:44:22.132
He's got a wife and kids...

541
00:44:22.705 --> 00:44:24.229
...and a mortgage.

542
00:44:24.406 --> 00:44:28.137
It was all supposed to be mine,
except for the wife.


543
00:44:30.079 --> 00:44:33.981
And you...
You don't look a thing like him.


544
00:44:34.149 --> 00:44:35.946
- You ugly bartender.
- Stop it.


545
00:44:36.118 --> 00:44:39.918
- You couldn't shine his shoes.
- I'm sorry.


546
00:44:40.089 --> 00:44:42.785
It wasn't supposed
to turn out like this.


547
00:44:42.958 --> 00:44:46.257
It wasn't supposed
to turn out like this.


548
00:44:47.296 --> 00:44:50.288
- Which way?
- Let me just see here.


549
00:44:50.466 --> 00:44:52.400
I'm not sure.

550
00:44:52.968 --> 00:44:56.233
- Where are we supposed to go?
- I think it's here.


551
00:44:56.405 --> 00:44:58.635
Come this way. 
We're almost there.

552
00:45:12.655 --> 00:45:13.986
Joe.

553
00:45:14.590 --> 00:45:16.990
- Hello.
- Hi. How are you?


554
00:45:17.159 --> 00:45:19.559
Great. Thank you so much for this.
You're a pal.


555
00:45:19.728 --> 00:45:21.787
It's a pleasure.
Your timing is perfect.


556
00:45:24.133 --> 00:45:25.998
There it is.

557
00:45:58.867 --> 00:46:02.098
- That's Jackson Pollock.
- In a word.


558
00:46:02.271 --> 00:46:06.708
I was getting used to the idea of dead,
maggoty meat being art, now this.


559
00:46:07.676 --> 00:46:10.702
Please don't tell me
we have to write a paper about it.


560
00:46:10.879 --> 00:46:12.312
Do me a favor.

561
00:46:12.481 --> 00:46:15.882
Do yourselves a favor.
Stop talking and look.


562
00:46:16.485 --> 00:46:21.513
You're not required to write a paper.
You're not even required to like it.


563
00:46:21.690 --> 00:46:23.954
You are required...

564
00:46:24.126 --> 00:46:25.821
...to consider it.

565
00:46:25.995 --> 00:46:30.694
That's your only assignment today.
When you're done, you may leave.


566
00:46:33.102 --> 00:46:35.798
Thank God Betty isn't here.

567
00:47:31.660 --> 00:47:33.719
Where did you come from?

568
00:47:33.896 --> 00:47:35.488
Mars.

569
00:47:36.765 --> 00:47:38.926
What a coincidence.

570
00:47:39.935 --> 00:47:45.896
Tom Donegal came by to see Joan.
So I hopped a ride.


571
00:47:46.275 --> 00:47:47.936
Why?

572
00:47:50.479 --> 00:47:52.572
So I could do this:

573
00:48:08.664 --> 00:48:10.894
- Katherine.
- Yes?


574
00:48:11.533 --> 00:48:13.501
- Have you got a minute?
- Of course.


575
00:48:13.669 --> 00:48:15.227
Walk with me.

576
00:48:16.004 --> 00:48:18.404
- You going home for the holidays?
- No.


577
00:48:18.574 --> 00:48:20.337
- Too far?
- Too expensive.


578
00:48:20.509 --> 00:48:23.034
But I've never had
a New England Christmas, so...


579
00:48:23.212 --> 00:48:26.943
- Our weather hasn't scared you away?
- I love it here.


580
00:48:27.116 --> 00:48:28.447
Do you?

581
00:48:28.817 --> 00:48:32.776
I've been getting some calls about
your teaching methods, Katherine.


582
00:48:32.955 --> 00:48:36.447
They're a little unorthodox...

583
00:48:36.625 --> 00:48:38.718
...for Wellesley.

584
00:48:38.894 --> 00:48:42.227
- We are traditionalists, Katherine.
- Yes, I noticed.


585
00:48:42.397 --> 00:48:44.922
So if you'd like to stay here...

586
00:48:45.100 --> 00:48:48.263
- Is that a question?
- More a discussion.


587
00:48:48.437 --> 00:48:52.806
- About my staying here?
- You'll have your formal review in May.


588
00:48:53.509 --> 00:48:55.477
Until then...

589
00:48:56.011 --> 00:48:59.276
...a little less modern art.

590
00:48:59.448 --> 00:49:01.348
Happy holidays.

591
00:49:01.517 --> 00:49:03.144
And to you.

592
00:49:09.291 --> 00:49:11.691
- Afternoon.
- Oh, hi...


593
00:49:16.498 --> 00:49:18.966
I hope you get that ring!

594
00:49:19.301 --> 00:49:22.930
Bye, girls, see you next year.
Have a safe trip.


595
00:49:31.046 --> 00:49:34.140
So, what's the big hush-hush secret?

596
00:49:34.316 --> 00:49:37.683
Are we gonna hear the pitter-patter
of little Spencers?


597
00:49:37.853 --> 00:49:40.083
Stop. They'll tell us
when they're ready.


598
00:49:40.255 --> 00:49:41.882
Are you ready?

599
00:49:42.057 --> 00:49:45.754
Is she the cutest? You are the cutest.
Come here, you.


600
00:49:50.666 --> 00:49:53.635
Spencer's been made junior partner.

601
00:49:54.503 --> 00:49:58.599
- It is about time.
- And it's a significant raise too!


602
00:49:58.774 --> 00:50:01.743
- Betty!
- What? I can say that, can't I?


603
00:50:01.910 --> 00:50:03.810
To Tommy and Joan?

604
00:50:03.979 --> 00:50:09.417
Well, it is.
So maybe a family isn't far behind.


605
00:50:10.519 --> 00:50:13.181
Let's take our coffee
in the sitting room, shall we?


606
00:50:13.355 --> 00:50:14.344
I'll help.

607
00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:21.123
- Keep them closed.
- All right.


608
00:50:26.034 --> 00:50:29.367
Beautiful! You've got everything
you've ever dreamed of.


609
00:50:29.538 --> 00:50:31.301
You will too.

610
00:50:32.374 --> 00:50:36.708
I've got a secret to tell you.
You swear you won't gab to anyone?


611
00:50:37.279 --> 00:50:40.407
I got accepted early
to Yale Law School.


612
00:50:40.582 --> 00:50:44.985
To what?! Why?!
You don't want to be a lawyer.


613
00:50:45.153 --> 00:50:46.916
Maybe I do.

614
00:50:47.222 --> 00:50:51.454
You won't switch cold creams without
asking me, but you applied to school?


615
00:50:51.627 --> 00:50:54.391
On a lark.
We never thought I'd get in.


616
00:50:54.563 --> 00:50:56.554
- Who's "we"?
- Miss Watson.


617
00:50:56.732 --> 00:50:59.895
She practically filled out
my application for me.


618
00:51:00.469 --> 00:51:03.404
You've got to be kidding me!
What right does she have?


619
00:51:03.572 --> 00:51:05.164
You're getting married!

620
00:51:05.340 --> 00:51:08.207
First of all,
there's no ring on this finger.


621
00:51:08.377 --> 00:51:11.869
Second, I can do both. I can.

622
00:51:12.414 --> 00:51:15.781
- How does Tommy feel about this?
- He doesn't know. No one does.


623
00:51:15.951 --> 00:51:18.977
- Not even her?
- No one.


624
00:51:19.154 --> 00:51:20.678
Joanie! Betty!

625
00:51:20.856 --> 00:51:23.825
You are this close to getting
everything you ever wanted.


626
00:51:23.992 --> 00:51:26.085
And this close to losing it.

627
00:51:37.906 --> 00:51:40.568
I just got a call.
They need me in New York tomorrow.


628
00:51:40.742 --> 00:51:43.540
Joan and Tommy are here.
Can't you leave in the morning?


629
00:51:43.712 --> 00:51:47.614
Then I'd miss the meeting.
Sorry, guys. We take a rain check?


630
00:51:47.783 --> 00:51:50.047
- Sure, buddy.
- We'll see you in the new year.


631
00:51:50.218 --> 00:51:52.118
Happy and merry.

632
00:51:55.590 --> 00:51:57.581
I'll call you in the morning.

633
00:52:10.706 --> 00:52:12.264
Coffee?

634
00:52:17.913 --> 00:52:20.814
Guess who has
an early Christmas present?


635
00:52:20.982 --> 00:52:24.611
- Oh, my! How can you live like this?
- Like what?


636
00:52:24.786 --> 00:52:27.152
We'll just wait for you
to tidy up a bit.


637
00:52:27.322 --> 00:52:31.156
In this lifetime? Lt'll never happen.
Come here, beautiful.


638
00:52:34.830 --> 00:52:37.697
What are you doing here?

639
00:52:38.066 --> 00:52:42.662
- You still like it here?
- I do. I like getting to know the girls.


640
00:52:42.838 --> 00:52:44.897
Most of the time.

641
00:52:45.073 --> 00:52:47.598
- And the weather.
- Yeah, the weather's nice.


642
00:52:47.776 --> 00:52:49.266
- Are you freezing?
- Yeah.


643
00:52:49.444 --> 00:52:52.140
- Your lips are a little blue.
- I like them that way.


644
00:52:52.314 --> 00:52:53.747
Why didn't you bring a coat?

645
00:53:18.974 --> 00:53:20.373
Bill.

646
00:53:22.077 --> 00:53:24.307
Giselle, what are you doing here?

647
00:53:25.514 --> 00:53:27.175
Freezing.

648
00:53:30.585 --> 00:53:34.715
Look, it's over.
I can't see you anymore.


649
00:53:34.890 --> 00:53:37.188
- I can't.
- I know.


650
00:53:38.693 --> 00:53:40.160
Really.

651
00:53:42.864 --> 00:53:45.298
I just want to talk to you
for a minute.


652
00:53:47.669 --> 00:53:49.261
Come on.

653
00:53:58.180 --> 00:53:59.875
Oh, I missed you.

654
00:54:01.383 --> 00:54:03.010
You're beautiful.

655
00:54:03.852 --> 00:54:05.752
Life without you...

656
00:54:05.921 --> 00:54:07.821
...just isn't life.

657
00:54:09.558 --> 00:54:12.857
And I don't want to go through life
not living. Do you?


658
00:54:13.328 --> 00:54:14.727
No.

659
00:54:14.963 --> 00:54:20.094
I love you so much I would move
to this elitist icebox if you want me to.


660
00:54:25.941 --> 00:54:28.307
Make an honest man out of me.

661
00:54:29.911 --> 00:54:31.776
Miss Watson?

662
00:54:32.147 --> 00:54:34.911
Hi. I didn't know you were here.

663
00:54:39.521 --> 00:54:43.480
Giselle Levy, Bill Dunbar,
this is...


664
00:54:43.658 --> 00:54:45.888
- This is my... Paul.
- Fiancé.


665
00:54:46.328 --> 00:54:49.320
As of about a minute and a half ago.
Paul Moore.


666
00:54:51.700 --> 00:54:55.830
God. Congratulations!
Your fiancé?


667
00:54:57.706 --> 00:54:59.503
You must be thrilled.

668
00:54:59.674 --> 00:55:02.142
I don't think she's caught
her breath yet.


669
00:55:02.310 --> 00:55:03.436
I haven't.

670
00:55:06.314 --> 00:55:10.842
- Well, sit down. We'll have a toast.
- We'd love to. We're in a hurry.


671
00:55:11.019 --> 00:55:14.147
But that's really great.
Congratulations, old man.


672
00:55:14.322 --> 00:55:17.587
- Congratulations. Merry Christmas.
- Come on, let's...


673
00:55:17.759 --> 00:55:21.286
Best of tidings to you both. Bye.

674
00:55:49.791 --> 00:55:51.315
No, Paul.

675
00:55:51.493 --> 00:55:54.257
Nancy'll have a heart attack.
She has these rules.


676
00:55:54.429 --> 00:55:56.863
- Come on.
- No.


677
00:55:57.566 --> 00:56:01.263
- Why?
- I said no. I'm not comfortable.


678
00:56:02.537 --> 00:56:05.233
I'll make up the convertible sofa.

679
00:56:12.447 --> 00:56:14.381
What are you doing?

680
00:56:16.851 --> 00:56:18.842
You're not kidding?

681
00:56:19.020 --> 00:56:24.481
I just came 3000 miles to see you.
I'm sleeping down here by myself?


682
00:56:28.330 --> 00:56:30.855
Stop. Stop. Stop for a second.

683
00:56:31.032 --> 00:56:34.729
- Tell me what the hell's going on.
- I don't know.


684
00:56:34.903 --> 00:56:37.303
I feel like everything
is getting away from me.


685
00:56:37.472 --> 00:56:42.569
We haven't actually, literally looked
at each other for three months...


686
00:56:42.744 --> 00:56:45.975
...and now you're here,
and I have this ring on my finger.


687
00:56:46.448 --> 00:56:49.042
Which makes you uncomfortable too?

688
00:56:50.018 --> 00:56:54.512
The last time I checked,
we weren't on this track.


689
00:56:54.856 --> 00:56:56.881
When was the last time
you checked?


690
00:57:17.912 --> 00:57:19.209
Bill...

691
00:57:20.749 --> 00:57:22.717
The name is Paul.

692
00:57:29.157 --> 00:57:32.422
I'm not saying no to you.

693
00:57:32.627 --> 00:57:34.959
No, you're not saying anything.

694
00:57:36.531 --> 00:57:38.556
You never really do.

695
00:57:58.486 --> 00:58:03.082
If you need me for anything else,
my number's on the refrigerator.


696
00:58:03.258 --> 00:58:05.920
I feel so guilty
leaving you alone after...


697
00:58:06.094 --> 00:58:08.619
I'm fine. I have lots of research
to do.


698
00:58:08.797 --> 00:58:12.392
That's right.
Throw yourself into work.


699
00:58:12.701 --> 00:58:13.861
I'll be back...

700
00:58:14.736 --> 00:58:16.567
...on the 2nd.

701
00:58:17.539 --> 00:58:19.404
See you next year.

702
00:58:19.574 --> 00:58:21.371
1954!

703
00:58:56.678 --> 00:58:59.647
Sunflowers. Vincent van Gogh. 1888.

704
00:58:59.814 --> 00:59:03.272
He painted what he felt,
not what he saw.


705
00:59:03.451 --> 00:59:06.852
People didn't understand. To them,
it seemed childlike and crude.


706
00:59:07.021 --> 00:59:10.252
It took years for them to recognize
his actual technique...


707
00:59:10.425 --> 00:59:14.293
...to see the way his brush strokes
seemed to make the night sky move.


708
00:59:14.462 --> 00:59:18.193
Yet, he never sold a painting
in his lifetime.


709
00:59:18.366 --> 00:59:20.357
This is his self-portrait.

710
00:59:20.535 --> 00:59:24.801
There's no camouflage, no romance.
Honesty.


711
00:59:24.973 --> 00:59:30.343
- Now, 60 years later, where is he?
- Famous?


712
00:59:30.512 --> 00:59:34.414
So famous, in fact,
that everybody has a reproduction.


713
00:59:34.582 --> 00:59:37.608
- There are post cards...
- We have the calendar.


714
00:59:37.786 --> 00:59:42.280
With the ability to reproduce art,
it is available to the masses.


715
00:59:42.457 --> 00:59:44.755
No one needs to own
a van Gogh original.


716
00:59:44.926 --> 00:59:47.861
We do. In the Newport house.

717
00:59:48.663 --> 00:59:51.723
But it's small. Tiny.

718
00:59:55.236 --> 00:59:58.501
They can paint their own.
Van Gogh in a box, ladies.


719
00:59:58.673 --> 01:00:01.733
The newest form
of mass-distributed art:


720
01:00:01.910 --> 01:00:03.502
Paint by numbers.

721
01:00:03.678 --> 01:00:06.704
"Now everyone can be van Gogh.
It's so easy.


722
01:00:06.881 --> 01:00:09.145
Just follow the simple instructions...

723
01:00:09.317 --> 01:00:12.286
...and in minutes, you're on
your way to being an artist."


724
01:00:13.321 --> 01:00:15.289
Van Gogh by numbers?

725
01:00:15.456 --> 01:00:19.085
Ironic, isn't it? Look at what
we have done to the man...


726
01:00:19.260 --> 01:00:22.889
...who refused to conform
his ideals to popular taste.


727
01:00:23.064 --> 01:00:26.124
Who refused to compromise
his integrity.


728
01:00:26.301 --> 01:00:31.864
We have put him in a tiny box
and asked you to copy him.


729
01:00:32.473 --> 01:00:34.168
So the choice is yours, ladies.

730
01:00:34.342 --> 01:00:38.779
You can conform to what
other people expect or you can...


731
01:00:38.947 --> 01:00:41.916
I know. Be ourselves.

732
01:00:42.884 --> 01:00:44.784
You're a sight for sore eyes.

733
01:00:44.953 --> 01:00:49.253
I would've been on time but, silly me,
I thought class was in the classroom.


734
01:00:49.424 --> 01:00:53.224
Glad you could join us, Mrs. Jones.
We thought we'd lost you.


735
01:00:53.461 --> 01:00:56.055
- There's an unwritten rule for marr...
- Don't bother.


736
01:00:56.231 --> 01:01:00.224
Since your wedding, you've missed
six classes, a paper and your midterm.


737
01:01:00.401 --> 01:01:03.859
Well, thank God I didn't miss
the paint-by-numbers lecture.


738
01:01:04.172 --> 01:01:07.699
I was on my honeymoon
and then I had to set up house.


739
01:01:07.876 --> 01:01:10.902
- What does she expect?
- Attendance.


740
01:01:12.547 --> 01:01:14.538
Most of the faculty turn their heads...

741
01:01:14.716 --> 01:01:17.617
...when the married students
miss a class or two.


742
01:01:17.785 --> 01:01:19.776
Then why not get married
as freshmen?


743
01:01:19.954 --> 01:01:25.051
That way you could graduate without
actually ever stepping foot on campus.


744
01:01:26.327 --> 01:01:30.627
Don't disregard our traditions
just because you're subversive.


745
01:01:32.100 --> 01:01:34.898
Don't disrespect this class
just because you're married.


746
01:01:35.069 --> 01:01:37.503
Don't disrespect me
just because you're not.


747
01:01:37.672 --> 01:01:40.869
Come to class, do the work,
or I'll fail you.


748
01:01:41.042 --> 01:01:44.136
If you fail me,
there will be consequences.


749
01:01:45.446 --> 01:01:49.143
- Are you threatening me?
- I'm educating you.


750
01:01:49.617 --> 01:01:51.448
That's my job.

751
01:02:33.061 --> 01:02:35.222
Miss Watson!

752
01:02:35.863 --> 01:02:37.694
Miss Watson!

753
01:02:40.401 --> 01:02:41.561
What's this?

754
01:02:41.736 --> 01:02:45.763
Every year, the ARs nominate a
member of the faculty to be our guest.


755
01:02:45.940 --> 01:02:47.305
The what?

756
01:02:47.475 --> 01:02:51.036
You'll see. Come by tonight at 5:00.

757
01:02:53.881 --> 01:02:57.578
Adam's Ribs. A very secret society.

758
01:02:57.752 --> 01:02:59.117
Wait here.

759
01:03:07.762 --> 01:03:11.061
First, the oath.
Please raise both hands.


760
01:03:12.734 --> 01:03:15.897
Do you swear not to repeat what
you see, hear or smell tonight?


761
01:03:16.070 --> 01:03:17.560
- Smell?
- Keep your hands up!


762
01:03:17.739 --> 01:03:19.832
Yes, smell.

763
01:03:20.108 --> 01:03:21.541
I do.

764
01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:41.892
It'll only burn for a second.

765
01:03:42.063 --> 01:03:43.621
Go on.

766
01:03:53.875 --> 01:03:59.609
And now that you've taken the oath,
we get to ask you whatever we want.


767
01:03:59.781 --> 01:04:03.979
- Oh, is that how it works?
- And you have to answer.


768
01:04:04.552 --> 01:04:05.678
Who invited her?

769
01:04:05.853 --> 01:04:08.048
You're in time
for truth or consequences.


770
01:04:08.222 --> 01:04:11.555
I go first. Why aren't you married?

771
01:04:13.761 --> 01:04:15.285
Well...

772
01:04:17.131 --> 01:04:18.758
That's poisonous.

773
01:04:18.933 --> 01:04:22.664
I'm not married because...

774
01:04:23.104 --> 01:04:24.662
...l'm not.

775
01:04:25.573 --> 01:04:30.033
I was engaged to Patrick Watts.

776
01:04:30.344 --> 01:04:33.939
Everybody called him Leo,
and I never knew why.


777
01:04:34.115 --> 01:04:39.075
He was the first person
that I ever danced with...


778
01:04:39.253 --> 01:04:44.156
...or smoked with,
got incredibly drunk with and...


779
01:04:44.325 --> 01:04:47.692
Well, a lot of first things.

780
01:04:49.130 --> 01:04:53.328
We were 18 and getting married,
Christmas of '41.


781
01:04:54.102 --> 01:04:58.038
Then Pearl Harbor happened
and everything changed.


782
01:04:58.206 --> 01:05:02.370
Everybody changed.
And by June, he was sent overseas.


783
01:05:02.577 --> 01:05:04.408
- Did he come back?
- Yes.


784
01:05:04.579 --> 01:05:07.207
- Was he changed?
- They both were.


785
01:05:10.651 --> 01:05:12.209
I'm sorry.

786
01:05:12.954 --> 01:05:15.616
- Your parents?
- Yeah.


787
01:05:17.558 --> 01:05:19.492
After the war...

788
01:05:20.194 --> 01:05:24.631
...they didn't know each other
anymore, didn't like each other.


789
01:05:26.567 --> 01:05:29.559
He left. He got a whole new family.

790
01:05:31.372 --> 01:05:32.896
Divorce.

791
01:05:33.074 --> 01:05:34.132
What?

792
01:05:34.308 --> 01:05:38.301
Yeah. First on my block.
That's a city block.


793
01:05:40.715 --> 01:05:44.981
People change. Things happen.
It's the same with me and Leo.


794
01:05:45.386 --> 01:05:48.048
He went off and married
someone else.


795
01:05:48.356 --> 01:05:51.848
- And I got to go to graduate school.
- UCLA, right?


796
01:05:52.026 --> 01:05:55.223
- Which is in Hollywood?
- It's close.


797
01:05:55.396 --> 01:06:00.595
Anyway, aren't you gonna tell
everybody about, you know...


798
01:06:01.302 --> 01:06:03.964
...your big news?
- What are you talking about?


799
01:06:04.172 --> 01:06:07.539
- She got engaged over Christmas!
- Congratulations!


800
01:06:07.708 --> 01:06:10.768
I'm sorry to blab.
It's just so romantic.


801
01:06:10.945 --> 01:06:12.708
How fantastic!

802
01:06:13.447 --> 01:06:15.210
We split up.

803
01:06:17.618 --> 01:06:20.917
- What?
- We split up.


804
01:06:22.757 --> 01:06:24.384
Well, that was fast.

805
01:06:24.559 --> 01:06:27.892
Well, not every relationship
is meant for marriage.


806
01:06:28.062 --> 01:06:31.293
- Some are strictly affairs?
- Bill Dunbar.


807
01:06:31.465 --> 01:06:34.696
He'd be an affair. Let's talk
about that, Miss Watson.


808
01:06:34.869 --> 01:06:36.894
You don't believe in withholding,
do you?


809
01:06:37.071 --> 01:06:41.770
No. I do, however, believe in manners.
But for you, I'll make an exception.


810
01:06:41.943 --> 01:06:45.845
That's what we're supposed to do
for married students. Right, Betty?


811
01:06:46.380 --> 01:06:50.612
Professor Dunbar and I
are not having an affair.


812
01:06:50.785 --> 01:06:52.616
Did you have one
with William Holden?


813
01:06:52.787 --> 01:06:54.812
- Connie!
- She asked about Bill Dunbar.


814
01:06:54.989 --> 01:06:57.822
- How did you hear that?
- Oh, it is true!


815
01:06:57.992 --> 01:06:59.289
Betty, I told you.

816
01:07:02.797 --> 01:07:06.028
- Won't you regret never marrying?
- There's still time.


817
01:07:06.200 --> 01:07:08.327
I guess I assume that I will
at some point.


818
01:07:08.502 --> 01:07:11.562
- I'm not gonna plan my life around it.
- Neither should we.


819
01:07:11.739 --> 01:07:13.570
- I didn't say that.
- You did to Joan.


820
01:07:13.741 --> 01:07:16.266
- That's what she told me.
- What are you saying?


821
01:07:16.444 --> 01:07:18.674
She knew you and Tommy
were getting engaged.


822
01:07:18.846 --> 01:07:21.280
And she practically filled out
your application.


823
01:07:21.449 --> 01:07:23.781
- I didn't say that.
- She's been accepted.


824
01:07:23.951 --> 01:07:27.250
Now she just has to figure out
a way to tell Tommy.


825
01:07:28.489 --> 01:07:31.856
Why don't you do it? You're good
at butting into people's business.


826
01:07:32.026 --> 01:07:35.587
Funny, that's what they say
about you.


827
01:07:37.598 --> 01:07:41.659
- Spencer, do I look all right?
- Yeah, fine.


828
01:07:41.836 --> 01:07:44.964
- I don't have a lot of time. Speed it up.
- Mr. Grouchy.


829
01:07:45.439 --> 01:07:49.034
- All right, here we go again.
- All right, go ahead, Louise.


830
01:07:50.011 --> 01:07:54.607
Married Wellesley girls have become
quite adept at balancing obligations.


831
01:07:54.882 --> 01:07:56.509
One hears such comments as:

832
01:07:56.684 --> 01:08:01.246
"I baste the chicken with one hand
and outline the paper with the other."


833
01:08:01.422 --> 01:08:04.619
While our mothers were called
to work for Lady Liberty...


834
01:08:04.792 --> 01:08:09.786
...it is our duty, nay, obligation
to reclaim our place in the home...


835
01:08:09.964 --> 01:08:14.526
...bearing the children that will carry
our traditions into the future.


836
01:08:14.702 --> 01:08:18.570
One must pause to consider why
Miss Katherine Watson...


837
01:08:18.739 --> 01:08:21.037
...instructor in the Art History
department...


838
01:08:21.208 --> 01:08:25.144
...has decided to declare war
on the holy sacrament of marriage.


839
01:08:25.313 --> 01:08:28.942
Her subversive and political teachings
encourage our Wellesley girls...


840
01:08:29.116 --> 01:08:32.677
...to reject the roles
they were born to fill.


841
01:08:49.670 --> 01:08:51.501
Thank you.

842
01:09:11.659 --> 01:09:13.854
Slide.

843
01:09:16.097 --> 01:09:18.565
- Contemporary art.
- That's just an advertisement.


844
01:09:18.733 --> 01:09:20.360
Quiet!

845
01:09:22.203 --> 01:09:24.865
Today you just listen.

846
01:09:26.741 --> 01:09:30.609
What will the future scholars see
when they study us?


847
01:09:32.413 --> 01:09:36.110
A portrait of women today?

848
01:09:38.919 --> 01:09:40.386
There you are, ladies.

849
01:09:41.355 --> 01:09:43.880
The perfect likeness
of a Wellesley graduate.


850
01:09:44.058 --> 01:09:49.724
Magna cum laude, doing exactly
what she was trained to do.


851
01:09:49.897 --> 01:09:51.159
Slide.

852
01:09:52.867 --> 01:09:54.129
A Rhodes scholar.

853
01:09:56.470 --> 01:10:00.338
I wonder if she recites Chaucer while
she presses her husband's shirts.


854
01:10:00.508 --> 01:10:01.770
Slide.

855
01:10:03.677 --> 01:10:07.704
Now, you physics majors can calculate
the mass and volume...


856
01:10:07.882 --> 01:10:10.646
...of every meat loaf you make.
Slide.


857
01:10:11.685 --> 01:10:14.119
A girdle to set you free.

858
01:10:14.288 --> 01:10:16.449
What does that mean?

859
01:10:21.595 --> 01:10:23.790
What does that mean?

860
01:10:25.065 --> 01:10:27.192
What does it mean?

861
01:10:31.572 --> 01:10:33.665
I give up.

862
01:10:35.709 --> 01:10:37.700
You win.

863
01:10:38.379 --> 01:10:42.679
The smartest women in the country.

864
01:10:45.319 --> 01:10:50.518
I didn't realize that
by demanding excellence...


865
01:10:50.991 --> 01:10:53.892
...I would be challenging...

866
01:10:56.163 --> 01:10:58.290
What did it say?

867
01:11:00.401 --> 01:11:01.993
What did it say?

868
01:11:04.472 --> 01:11:07.908
"The roles you were born to fill."

869
01:11:08.809 --> 01:11:10.743
Is that right?

870
01:11:14.415 --> 01:11:17.043
The roles you were born to fill?

871
01:11:24.358 --> 01:11:26.792
It's my mistake.

872
01:11:39.773 --> 01:11:42.105
Class dismissed.

873
01:11:54.355 --> 01:11:58.849
These girls...
Are you proud, President Carr?


874
01:11:59.026 --> 01:12:03.053
- Yes, actually, I am.
- Well, you should be, I guess.


875
01:12:03.230 --> 01:12:06.666
Half of them are married.
The other half, give it a month or so.


876
01:12:06.834 --> 01:12:08.961
It's really only a matter of time.

877
01:12:09.136 --> 01:12:11.400
They're biding time
until somebody proposes!


878
01:12:11.572 --> 01:12:14.439
A hundred years ago, it was
inconceivable for a woman...


879
01:12:14.608 --> 01:12:16.098
...to be a college graduate.

880
01:12:16.277 --> 01:12:19.110
Perhaps you should look back
to see how far we've come.


881
01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:22.647
I'm sorry, from where I sit,
it's just a different kind of corset.


882
01:12:22.816 --> 01:12:26.877
- Well, we can all use a little support.
- Oh, like Amanda Armstrong?


883
01:12:27.054 --> 01:12:29.386
- She broke the law!
- According to Betty Warren.


884
01:12:29.557 --> 01:12:31.991
According to the state
of Massachusetts.


885
01:12:35.963 --> 01:12:38.158
To hell with Wellesley.
I'm done.


886
01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:42.200
Goddamn it!

887
01:12:44.471 --> 01:12:46.939
It's brilliant, really.
A perfect ruse.


888
01:12:47.107 --> 01:12:49.974
A finishing school disguised
as a college. They got me.


889
01:12:50.144 --> 01:12:52.078
- What do you expect?
- More. More.


890
01:12:52.246 --> 01:12:55.909
I thought it was a place for
tomorrow's leaders, not their wives.


891
01:12:56.083 --> 01:12:57.914
- Calm down, please.
- No, I will not!


892
01:12:58.085 --> 01:13:01.350
I've got 10 more minutes.
Meet me in my office. Meet me!


893
01:13:26.614 --> 01:13:31.950
- How you feeling?
- Stupid. Deceived.


894
01:13:32.186 --> 01:13:35.155
Really, really angry.

895
01:13:36.590 --> 01:13:42.085
Change takes time, you know?
You gotta let them catch up with you.


896
01:13:43.063 --> 01:13:45.691
Katherine, this place needs you.

897
01:13:46.266 --> 01:13:50.794
I don't know how the hell they let
you in, but I'm sure glad they did.


898
01:13:53.874 --> 01:13:58.709
The things I said to President Carr.
She'll never let me back in.


899
01:13:58.879 --> 01:14:00.642
She's a pretty good egg.

900
01:14:01.949 --> 01:14:04.144
What things?

901
01:14:04.318 --> 01:14:06.377
Don't worry.

902
01:14:06.820 --> 01:14:08.651
Time will heal it.

903
01:14:08.822 --> 01:14:12.815
Unless, of course, you want to go back
to California and that fiancé of yours.


904
01:14:14.261 --> 01:14:17.355
We're not engaged. Thanks.

905
01:14:17.531 --> 01:14:20.728
Sorry I interrupted your class.

906
01:14:30.944 --> 01:14:32.571
Katherine!

907
01:14:36.850 --> 01:14:41.310
I wanted to give you this.
It was for Christmas, and...


908
01:14:41.555 --> 01:14:44.422
Then I met your man, so I...

909
01:15:00.774 --> 01:15:03.265
The Sistine Chapel.

910
01:15:03.944 --> 01:15:05.741
David.

911
01:15:06.313 --> 01:15:09.407
Venus de Milo. And...

912
01:15:10.217 --> 01:15:11.912
...Mona Lisa.

913
01:15:14.655 --> 01:15:16.646
Thank you.

914
01:15:24.565 --> 01:15:27.796
This is gonna be
a three-in-one shot. Ready?


915
01:15:29.770 --> 01:15:32.762
You didn't even try.

916
01:15:34.341 --> 01:15:37.640
This game is probably a no-no
in the Better Homes and Gardens.


917
01:15:37.811 --> 01:15:41.975
Not that I have ever been in the
better homes and gardens. Have you?


918
01:15:42.149 --> 01:15:44.310
No. No, I'm just an old soldier.

919
01:15:44.485 --> 01:15:48.251
They don't invite us.

920
01:15:48.422 --> 01:15:50.515
What do they say about them though?

921
01:15:50.691 --> 01:15:53.421
- Old soldiers never die. We just...
- They just...


922
01:15:53.594 --> 01:15:57.052
...become philandering
Italian professors.


923
01:15:57.231 --> 01:15:59.358
- That was below the belt.
- That was unkind.


924
01:15:59.533 --> 01:16:00.966
Deeply unkind.

925
01:16:15.616 --> 01:16:19.074
You know, I don't know how I feel
about being a rebound.


926
01:16:19.253 --> 01:16:23.451
- I'll leave.
- No, you don't have to do that.


927
01:16:23.624 --> 01:16:25.888
I'll get used to it.

928
01:16:26.126 --> 01:16:29.391
- What are you doing?
- Getting dressed.


929
01:16:29.563 --> 01:16:33.522
I had fun, and I'm not looking
for anything serious.


930
01:16:33.700 --> 01:16:36.396
Why don't you come down here
and we can discuss it.


931
01:16:36.570 --> 01:16:40.836
But as long as we're doing
whatever it is that we're doing...


932
01:16:41.008 --> 01:16:43.841
Which we did pretty well,
don't you think?


933
01:16:47.114 --> 01:16:48.706
No students.

934
01:16:50.517 --> 01:16:52.917
I'm serious.

935
01:16:53.487 --> 01:16:58.686
I don't want to teach a class wondering
why a girl is wearing my perfume.


936
01:17:00.527 --> 01:17:03.621
- Katherine, l...
- I need your word.


937
01:17:07.301 --> 01:17:08.768
All right, you have my word.

938
01:17:11.538 --> 01:17:13.836
- Okay.
- Now can we change the subject?


939
01:17:14.007 --> 01:17:17.704
Talk about something
a little more interesting?


940
01:17:17.878 --> 01:17:21.006
Like breakfast.

941
01:17:21.448 --> 01:17:23.780
You know, I make
a mean blueberry pancake.


942
01:17:23.951 --> 01:17:25.885
I just put that shoe on.

943
01:17:26.053 --> 01:17:28.681
I don't think I know you
well enough for breakfast.


944
01:17:28.856 --> 01:17:30.551
I don't know about that.

945
01:17:34.261 --> 01:17:36.320
So how does a guy
get to know you better?


946
01:17:36.496 --> 01:17:40.489
Well, let me...
That's a good idea.


947
01:17:48.275 --> 01:17:50.743
Is that a battle wound you have?

948
01:17:54.581 --> 01:17:58.711
I'm a sucker for war stories
in Romance languages.


949
01:17:58.886 --> 01:18:01.218
- Well, that's pretty easy.
- Yeah?


950
01:18:03.023 --> 01:18:08.984
I was in a village... called San Remo...

951
01:18:11.098 --> 01:18:15.000
...the Krauts pounded us hard...

952
01:18:15.168 --> 01:18:16.726
...me & Stan...

953
01:18:16.970 --> 01:18:21.703
...you remember Stan? We were the
only two left from our platoon.


954
01:18:21.975 --> 01:18:29.313
We heard a distant cry coming
from an abandoned shed.


955
01:18:30.117 --> 01:18:31.709
When night fell...

956
01:18:32.352 --> 01:18:33.717
A trap it was?

957
01:18:37.024 --> 01:18:38.514
Remember...

958
01:18:39.326 --> 01:18:41.886
...invert your nouns and
your verbs.


959
01:19:06.553 --> 01:19:08.180
- Hungry?
- Famished.


960
01:19:08.355 --> 01:19:11.449
Don't say we can live on love.
That's how I missed breakfast.


961
01:19:15.696 --> 01:19:17.527
What's the matter?

962
01:19:18.865 --> 01:19:22.301
- What's the matter?
- Phillip and Vanessa Mclntyre.


963
01:19:22.469 --> 01:19:25.063
- Parents of a friend.
- You wanna say a quick hello?


964
01:19:25.238 --> 01:19:28.230
No! No, I'll be trapped.

965
01:19:28.408 --> 01:19:30.171
Damn it!

966
01:19:33.313 --> 01:19:35.975
- Could you seat us in the bar?
- We're only serving...


967
01:19:36.149 --> 01:19:39.209
...in the front part of the restaurant
this afternoon.


968
01:19:43.056 --> 01:19:45.718
Miss! Miss Stone.

969
01:19:45.892 --> 01:19:50.556
This has been the most romantic
weekend I may ever have.


970
01:19:50.731 --> 01:19:54.861
Ever. And all that's standing
between right now and perfection...


971
01:19:55.102 --> 01:19:57.366
...are the Mclntyres over there.

972
01:19:57.537 --> 01:20:02.770
Now, with the competition out there,
a girl's got to be able to move...


973
01:20:02.943 --> 01:20:05.707
...a few mountains
every once in a while.


974
01:20:05.879 --> 01:20:09.645
- I could use all the help I could get.
- Come this way.


975
01:20:14.354 --> 01:20:18.518
- I fixed it. No more Mclntyres.
- Thank you. Thank you.


976
01:20:20.827 --> 01:20:24.388
- Let's not talk about this.
- All right.


977
01:20:27.100 --> 01:20:29.227
Hold your breath and...

978
01:20:31.538 --> 01:20:33.563
And turn.

979
01:20:34.107 --> 01:20:37.440
Don't forget to smile.

980
01:20:38.512 --> 01:20:40.309
Arms up.

981
01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:43.142
Move together. Faster, Fran!

982
01:20:44.317 --> 01:20:47.753
- When you surface, smile.
- Come on, Connie!


983
01:20:50.390 --> 01:20:53.882
How about we have a girls' luncheon
this weekend? Just us.


984
01:20:54.728 --> 01:20:57.162
- Where's Spencer?
- Away.


985
01:20:57.330 --> 01:20:59.525
- I'm free.
- I'm busy.


986
01:20:59.699 --> 01:21:02.224
- What are you doing?
- She's dating a psychoanalyst.


987
01:21:02.402 --> 01:21:04.165
- Oh, really?
- Who's married.


988
01:21:04.337 --> 01:21:06.931
- Giselle!
- Sorry, it slipped.


989
01:21:07.107 --> 01:21:09.473
- Are you in, Connie?
- I'll check with Charlie.


990
01:21:09.643 --> 01:21:12.578
- Who?
- Charlie Stewart. Your cousin.


991
01:21:12.746 --> 01:21:14.805
You're kidding?

992
01:21:17.150 --> 01:21:19.880
We spent last weekend at the Cape.

993
01:21:20.053 --> 01:21:23.682
- A little hideaway he knew about.
- Operative word, "hide."


994
01:21:23.857 --> 01:21:27.190
Men take women to the Cape in
the winter when they're embarrassed.


995
01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:30.523
- He's using you.
- He's not using you if you want to go.


996
01:21:30.697 --> 01:21:32.426
Come here. Don't listen to her.

997
01:21:33.166 --> 01:21:36.067
I love you, and I swear
I'm not saying this to hurt you.


998
01:21:36.236 --> 01:21:40.263
Charlie's promised to Deb Mclntyre.
She wears his pin.


999
01:21:41.074 --> 01:21:44.805
- Giselle, you know it's true.
- I don't know anything about a pin.


1000
01:21:44.978 --> 01:21:46.969
Mclntyre?

1001
01:21:47.414 --> 01:21:50.281
Are her parents named
Phillip and Vanessa?


1002
01:21:50.884 --> 01:21:52.749
You know them?

1003
01:21:54.421 --> 01:21:56.184
Only from a distance.

1004
01:22:09.035 --> 01:22:12.835
- Good morning. Good morning.
- Goodbye. Good morning.


1005
01:22:13.006 --> 01:22:15.497
Okay, wait. No, we have an audience.
Don't look.


1006
01:22:18.111 --> 01:22:20.272
No, I don't...
No. Stop it. Put me down.


1007
01:22:20.447 --> 01:22:22.745
Put me down.
You're not coming in this house.


1008
01:22:22.916 --> 01:22:26.283
You are not coming
in this house. No.


1009
01:22:26.453 --> 01:22:28.216
- Bye. Good morning.
- Good morning.


1010
01:22:28.388 --> 01:22:30.356
Go away. Go away.

1011
01:22:37.430 --> 01:22:42.367
How can you date a man like that?

1012
01:22:43.503 --> 01:22:46.370
What if you're wrong about him?

1013
01:22:46.540 --> 01:22:48.701
What if I'm not?

1014
01:22:53.880 --> 01:22:56.348
Coffee's cold.

1015
01:23:17.537 --> 01:23:19.027
Row!

1016
01:23:19.206 --> 01:23:20.605
Ride the plank!

1017
01:23:20.774 --> 01:23:22.969
Row!

1018
01:23:44.998 --> 01:23:47.398
Are your ears burning?

1019
01:23:48.101 --> 01:23:51.161
I think the feet go first
when they set the stake on fire.


1020
01:23:51.338 --> 01:23:54.102
"What do you say, Edward?
Should we have her back?"


1021
01:23:54.274 --> 01:23:56.538
"She's got rather nice legs."

1022
01:23:56.710 --> 01:23:58.769
- Who's to say I wanna come back?
- What...


1023
01:23:58.945 --> 01:24:01.743
...leave me here with all these girls?

1024
01:24:11.791 --> 01:24:14.089
You'd think someone
would notice empty trays.


1025
01:24:14.261 --> 01:24:17.628
You are good. You remind me
of myself when I was your age.


1026
01:24:32.579 --> 01:24:34.479
Cheers.

1027
01:24:34.714 --> 01:24:38.582
He's positively vomititious, Giselle.

1028
01:24:38.885 --> 01:24:41.513
Don't be so sentimental, Connie.

1029
01:24:42.689 --> 01:24:45.988
It was a fling. It's fine.
It was nothing.


1030
01:24:54.968 --> 01:24:56.936
Hi!

1031
01:24:58.104 --> 01:25:00.038
Pleasure to meet you.

1032
01:25:05.779 --> 01:25:08.270
Would you excuse me?
I'll be right back.


1033
01:25:09.182 --> 01:25:12.413
Connie! Connie!
Excuse me. Sorry. Connie!


1034
01:25:12.585 --> 01:25:15.486
Charlie. It's been a while.

1035
01:25:15.655 --> 01:25:18.522
Yeah. How are you?

1036
01:25:18.758 --> 01:25:21.420
I'm fine, thank you. You? Deb?

1037
01:25:22.295 --> 01:25:25.924
- Pardon?
- Deb. Your girlfriend.


1038
01:25:26.099 --> 01:25:27.930
With the very large...

1039
01:25:28.101 --> 01:25:29.864
With the very large teeth.

1040
01:25:30.036 --> 01:25:32.334
With the very large teeth.

1041
01:25:32.505 --> 01:25:36.464
- Oh, did you think I didn't know?
- Connie.


1042
01:25:36.643 --> 01:25:40.602
Deb and I broke it off last summer.
That's Miranda.


1043
01:25:40.780 --> 01:25:46.412
We started seeing each other when
you stopped returning my calls...


1044
01:25:46.586 --> 01:25:49.555
...or answering any of my letters.

1045
01:25:55.261 --> 01:25:56.751
Okay, maybe I should go.

1046
01:26:16.216 --> 01:26:18.707
Have you seen Spencer?

1047
01:26:25.458 --> 01:26:28.291
But I did see Charlie Stewart.

1048
01:26:29.863 --> 01:26:33.629
And he told me that he and Deb
broke up last summer.


1049
01:26:34.334 --> 01:26:38.634
And you told me they were together
when he invited me to the Cape.


1050
01:26:38.805 --> 01:26:41.831
Oh, Connie.
I don't keep track of his dates.


1051
01:26:42.008 --> 01:26:46.536
They've been on-again, off-again
for the past few years.


1052
01:26:46.713 --> 01:26:50.843
No, apparently they've been
off-again for a while. For quite a while.


1053
01:26:51.017 --> 01:26:53.986
- So?
- So you made me believe...


1054
01:26:54.154 --> 01:26:56.782
...that he was hiding me.

1055
01:26:58.958 --> 01:27:01.290
Either way...

1056
01:27:01.461 --> 01:27:04.294
...why couldn't you let me be happy?

1057
01:27:10.570 --> 01:27:12.470
Betty.

1058
01:27:35.962 --> 01:27:38.260
And we switch.

1059
01:27:40.166 --> 01:27:42.964
- Wonder teacher.
- Tommy.


1060
01:27:45.305 --> 01:27:48.832
- How's Harvard?
- Oh, not too bad. Not too bad.


1061
01:27:49.008 --> 01:27:51.499
- Congratulate me.
- You set a date?


1062
01:27:54.047 --> 01:27:56.072
No, nothing official. Yet.

1063
01:27:56.249 --> 01:27:59.241
I meant, I got into Penn. Grad school.

1064
01:27:59.719 --> 01:28:02.688
Congratulations. 
What about Yale?

1065
01:28:03.289 --> 01:28:08.556
Yale? Oh, you mean Joanie.
Yeah. How about that, huh?


1066
01:28:08.795 --> 01:28:11.355
She is some girl.

1067
01:28:11.531 --> 01:28:14.091
- She's terrific.
- Yeah.


1068
01:28:14.267 --> 01:28:19.500
Just the fact that she got in.
I mean, she will always have that.


1069
01:28:19.672 --> 01:28:23.608
Thanks to you. Miss Watson,
you've been real swell to her.


1070
01:28:23.776 --> 01:28:26.370
We both appreciate it.

1071
01:28:27.780 --> 01:28:31.079
I'm sorry. "The fact that she got in,"
what does that mean?


1072
01:28:31.251 --> 01:28:34.550
Well, she'll be in Philadelphia.

1073
01:28:34.721 --> 01:28:36.188
With me.

1074
01:28:39.459 --> 01:28:43.555
Well, that's an awful long commute
to get dinner on the table by 5:00.


1075
01:28:44.163 --> 01:28:47.929
- And we switch.
- Thank you.


1076
01:28:53.973 --> 01:28:55.804
Excuse me.

1077
01:28:56.075 --> 01:28:59.442
Excuse me. Have you seen Spencer?
I can't find him anywhere.


1078
01:29:03.182 --> 01:29:06.982
Actually, Spencer asked me
to take you home.


1079
01:29:07.153 --> 01:29:11.283
- He has this meeting...
- In New York.


1080
01:29:11.691 --> 01:29:13.556
Thank you.

1081
01:29:42.221 --> 01:29:45.657
- Honey, what are you doing here?
- I'm staying the night.


1082
01:29:45.825 --> 01:29:49.625
- Spencer won't mind?
- Spencer won't notice.


1083
01:29:49.796 --> 01:29:55.428
- He's in New York again. Working.
- He's working hard for both of you.


1084
01:29:55.602 --> 01:29:59.436
Don't lie for him, Mother.
He does it so well for himself.


1085
01:29:59.606 --> 01:30:02.097
You're going to turn around,
go home...


1086
01:30:02.275 --> 01:30:04.573
...fix your face
and wait for your husband.


1087
01:30:04.744 --> 01:30:07.941
This is the bargain you made,
Elizabeth. We all did.


1088
01:30:08.114 --> 01:30:10.548
So you're not gonna let me
stay in my own house?


1089
01:30:10.717 --> 01:30:12.878
Spencer's house is your house now.

1090
01:30:13.052 --> 01:30:17.011
Believe me, it's for your own good.

1091
01:30:34.073 --> 01:30:36.871
Miss Watson. Come in.

1092
01:30:37.310 --> 01:30:40.074
Seven law schools within 45 minutes
of Philadelphia.


1093
01:30:40.246 --> 01:30:42.976
You can study and get dinner
on the table by 5:00.


1094
01:30:43.149 --> 01:30:45.982
- It's too late.
- No. Some accept late admissions.


1095
01:30:46.152 --> 01:30:48.313
- I was upset at first.
- Joan, the guests.


1096
01:30:48.488 --> 01:30:51.457
When Tommy told me that he got
accepted to Penn, I thought:


1097
01:30:51.624 --> 01:30:54.422
"Her fate is sealed.
How can she throw it all away?"


1098
01:30:54.594 --> 01:30:58.394
I realized you won't have to. You
could bake your cake and eat it too.


1099
01:30:58.564 --> 01:31:00.794
We're married.

1100
01:31:02.101 --> 01:31:03.932
We eloped over the weekend.

1101
01:31:04.103 --> 01:31:06.867
Turned out he was petrified
of a big ceremony...


1102
01:31:07.040 --> 01:31:10.134
...so we did a sort of
spur-of-the-moment thing.


1103
01:31:10.309 --> 01:31:12.243
Very romantic.

1104
01:31:12.412 --> 01:31:14.175
Look.

1105
01:31:22.588 --> 01:31:24.715
It's beautiful.

1106
01:31:27.727 --> 01:31:32.528
It was my choice. Not to go.
He would have supported it.


1107
01:31:33.132 --> 01:31:36.727
- But you don't have to choose.
- No, I have to.


1108
01:31:36.903 --> 01:31:39.872
I want a home, a family.
It's not something I'll sacrifice.


1109
01:31:40.039 --> 01:31:43.202
No one's asking you
to sacrifice that, Joan.


1110
01:31:43.376 --> 01:31:46.106
I just want you to understand
that you can do both.


1111
01:31:46.279 --> 01:31:49.146
Think I'll wake up one day
and regret not being a lawyer?


1112
01:31:49.315 --> 01:31:50.873
Yes, I'm afraid that you will.

1113
01:31:51.050 --> 01:31:55.487
Not as much as I'd regret not having
a family. Not being there to raise them.


1114
01:31:55.655 --> 01:32:00.058
I know exactly what I'm doing, and
it doesn't make me any less smart.


1115
01:32:00.927 --> 01:32:03.953
- This must seem terrible to you.
- I didn't say that. I...


1116
01:32:04.130 --> 01:32:07.156
Sure you did. You always do.

1117
01:32:07.333 --> 01:32:11.030
You stand in class and tell us to look
beyond the image, but you don't.


1118
01:32:11.204 --> 01:32:15.106
To you, a housewife is someone who
sold her soul for a center hall colonial.


1119
01:32:15.274 --> 01:32:19.074
She has no depth,
no intellect, no interests.


1120
01:32:21.848 --> 01:32:25.648
You're the one who said
I could do anything I wanted.


1121
01:32:25.818 --> 01:32:28.184
This is what I want.

1122
01:32:32.759 --> 01:32:34.920
Congratulations.

1123
01:32:35.094 --> 01:32:37.119
Be happy.

1124
01:32:58.184 --> 01:33:02.280
Sometimes I think you say
these things to provoke me.


1125
01:33:02.455 --> 01:33:05.424
Does your father know
that you speak this way?


1126
01:33:09.929 --> 01:33:12.727
Does your wife know you're here?

1127
01:33:50.436 --> 01:33:54.099
- Where might I find Charlie Stewart?
- Charlie Stewart? C1744.


1128
01:33:54.273 --> 01:33:57.538
- But it's too late. You'll have to leave.
- All right.


1129
01:34:02.181 --> 01:34:04.342
You can't go up there!

1130
01:34:07.587 --> 01:34:09.452
What is going on here?

1131
01:34:09.622 --> 01:34:11.954
There's no women allowed
in the dorms!


1132
01:34:13.826 --> 01:34:16.954
Can you please not interrupt me?!

1133
01:34:18.531 --> 01:34:23.662
Connie! What are you doing here?

1134
01:34:25.571 --> 01:34:26.936
Well, I saw...

1135
01:34:27.106 --> 01:34:29.199
I saw Big Teeth with...

1136
01:34:29.375 --> 01:34:32.970
...Kevin Tawil looking pretty cozy,
and I thought that maybe...


1137
01:34:33.145 --> 01:34:35.739
Maybe you two weren't...

1138
01:34:36.649 --> 01:34:40.380
- Dating?
- Yes. Thank you.


1139
01:34:40.653 --> 01:34:42.814
Hey, no girls in the dorm.

1140
01:34:46.826 --> 01:34:50.057
I know I have made mistakes.
A ton.


1141
01:34:50.630 --> 01:34:53.463
But I never make them twice.

1142
01:35:12.785 --> 01:35:14.309
And?

1143
01:35:14.887 --> 01:35:20.484
And it was perfect. Romantic.
We stayed up all night talking.


1144
01:35:20.660 --> 01:35:22.992
You're late. What happened
to Sunday brunch?


1145
01:35:23.162 --> 01:35:26.359
We stayed up all night too.
Not talking.


1146
01:35:26.999 --> 01:35:30.332
The psychoanalyst? Again.

1147
01:35:32.238 --> 01:35:35.298
- Divine exhaustion.
- He's married.


1148
01:35:35.474 --> 01:35:37.271
He's not married like
you and Tommy.


1149
01:35:37.443 --> 01:35:38.876
What does that mean?

1150
01:35:39.045 --> 01:35:42.173
It means he and his wife
don't speak the same language.


1151
01:35:42.348 --> 01:35:45.112
- Spelled S-E-X.
- Does he pay you?


1152
01:35:45.284 --> 01:35:46.808
For sex?

1153
01:35:47.153 --> 01:35:49.678
At the rate you're going,
you could make a fortune.


1154
01:35:50.222 --> 01:35:53.623
- Betty.
- Everyone thinks so.


1155
01:35:53.793 --> 01:35:57.490
Do you know what they say?
They say you're a whore.


1156
01:35:57.997 --> 01:36:02.024
Once they've all sampled you,
they'll toss you aside like a used rag.


1157
01:36:02.201 --> 01:36:05.034
- Betty, stop now.
- The men you love don't want you.


1158
01:36:05.204 --> 01:36:08.571
- Your father doesn't want you.
- I'm gonna meet you downstairs.


1159
01:36:08.741 --> 01:36:10.766
- Professor Dunbar.
- Betty, that's enough.


1160
01:36:10.943 --> 01:36:13.673
Everybody knows that you hide
outside his house.


1161
01:36:13.879 --> 01:36:17.542
It must be torturous running after
a man who doesn't care about you...


1162
01:36:17.984 --> 01:36:21.283
...who's in love with someone else,
who hates you.


1163
01:36:21.454 --> 01:36:23.786
- He hates you!
- Betty.


1164
01:36:23.956 --> 01:36:25.890
And it hurts! No!

1165
01:36:26.058 --> 01:36:29.050
- Get off me!
- Quiet!


1166
01:36:38.137 --> 01:36:40.128
Oh, God.

1167
01:36:41.941 --> 01:36:45.240
- He doesn't want me.
- Okay.


1168
01:36:45.444 --> 01:36:48.538
He doesn't sleep with me. He...

1169
01:36:48.848 --> 01:36:50.372
I know.

1170
01:37:02.795 --> 01:37:06.993
I say no. I mean,
it's not fair to her.

1171
01:37:07.166 --> 01:37:10.795
- She's not happy.
- Don't forget about her outburst.


1172
01:37:10.970 --> 01:37:13.097
Oh, that's right.

1173
01:37:13.372 --> 01:37:16.967
Dr. Staunton, will you tell the
alumnae the figures you have?


1174
01:37:17.143 --> 01:37:20.112
Enrollment for her class next year...

1175
01:37:20.279 --> 01:37:24.773
...is the highest
the department's had. Ever.


1176
01:37:25.785 --> 01:37:28.447
She'd have to promise
to turn in her lesson plans.


1177
01:37:28.854 --> 01:37:32.756
In advance. And they'll need
to be approved.


1178
01:37:32.925 --> 01:37:34.916
She'll never agree to that.

1179
01:37:44.136 --> 01:37:47.264
Bill, the brochures
for Europe arrived.


1180
01:37:51.777 --> 01:37:53.677
Surprise!

1181
01:37:54.013 --> 01:37:56.709
Sir, I'm so sorry!

1182
01:37:56.882 --> 01:37:59.373
- Who are you?
- I'm Stanley Sher...


1183
01:37:59.552 --> 01:38:02.146
...a friend of Bill's.
We were in the 37th together.


1184
01:38:02.321 --> 01:38:05.085
- Okay.
- You must be Katherine.


1185
01:38:05.257 --> 01:38:07.248
I am.

1186
01:38:07.426 --> 01:38:10.953
He told me you were a looker, but...

1187
01:38:12.932 --> 01:38:16.868
- I'll wait for you downstairs, Stanley.
- Okey-dokey.


1188
01:38:20.806 --> 01:38:23.070
So you and Bill
were in the war together?


1189
01:38:23.242 --> 01:38:26.769
Yep. Now he's some
fancy teacher...


1190
01:38:26.946 --> 01:38:29.312
...and I'm in air conditioning.

1191
01:38:29.482 --> 01:38:30.972
Forget the A-bomb.

1192
01:38:31.917 --> 01:38:34.818
Freon. It's gonna change
the good old U.S. Of A.


1193
01:38:35.187 --> 01:38:39.180
Open the entire West to development.
I'm based in El Paso.


1194
01:38:39.625 --> 01:38:42.492
- Oh, thank you.
- And cheers.


1195
01:38:45.364 --> 01:38:47.832
Well, you've come a long way
from San Remo.


1196
01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:49.934
Yes, sirree.

1197
01:38:50.536 --> 01:38:52.697
That in California?

1198
01:38:53.405 --> 01:38:54.929
Italy.

1199
01:38:55.107 --> 01:38:58.508
- Where you two were stationed.
- Italy?


1200
01:38:58.677 --> 01:39:01.145
Well, somebody's been
pulling your long leg.


1201
01:39:01.313 --> 01:39:05.545
We were stationed at the Army
Language Institute on Long Island.


1202
01:39:05.718 --> 01:39:09.654
Closest we ever got to Italy
was the baked ziti at Mama Leone's.


1203
01:39:09.822 --> 01:39:12.757
I don't think Bill's
ever been to Europe.


1204
01:39:12.925 --> 01:39:15.086
I sure as hell haven't.

1205
01:39:15.494 --> 01:39:16.756
Cheers.

1206
01:39:26.939 --> 01:39:28.873
Katherine!

1207
01:39:32.878 --> 01:39:34.607
You okay?

1208
01:39:35.581 --> 01:39:37.640
I met Stan.

1209
01:39:38.584 --> 01:39:39.846
Hell of a nice guy.

1210
01:39:40.019 --> 01:39:41.782
- Yeah.
- What a talker.


1211
01:39:41.954 --> 01:39:43.888
Yeah.

1212
01:39:44.056 --> 01:39:47.116
We go back a long way.

1213
01:39:47.293 --> 01:39:49.818
All the way to Long Island.

1214
01:39:53.766 --> 01:39:55.996
Secret's out.

1215
01:39:57.503 --> 01:40:00.233
What an incredible lie.

1216
01:40:03.309 --> 01:40:06.904
I spoke the language, I had the
uniform, people just assumed things.


1217
01:40:07.079 --> 01:40:11.573
I didn't correct them.
I guess I should've done.


1218
01:40:12.818 --> 01:40:15.218
I guess you should've done.

1219
01:40:16.956 --> 01:40:19.857
Katherine, look, 
I'm sorry, okay?

1220
01:40:20.492 --> 01:40:22.517
I made a mistake.

1221
01:40:22.695 --> 01:40:24.595
Just give me a chance...

1222
01:40:24.763 --> 01:40:27.288
...to straighten things out, okay?

1223
01:40:30.569 --> 01:40:33.367
Why couldn't you just be honest?

1224
01:40:36.141 --> 01:40:38.234
You don't make it easy.

1225
01:40:40.412 --> 01:40:42.277
You're so perfect, you...

1226
01:40:44.383 --> 01:40:47.409
It's impossible to be honest
with you. I...


1227
01:40:48.520 --> 01:40:50.613
For you, it is.

1228
01:40:53.792 --> 01:40:57.853
Well, it's not just me, Katherine.
Joan failed you too, right?


1229
01:40:58.030 --> 01:41:01.431
- That's an awful thing to say.
- I know, but it's the truth.


1230
01:41:02.735 --> 01:41:05.533
If you want honesty,
I can be real honest.


1231
01:41:05.738 --> 01:41:08.730
You didn't come to Wellesley
to help people find their way.


1232
01:41:08.907 --> 01:41:12.434
I think you came to help people
find your way.


1233
01:41:37.069 --> 01:41:40.505
I'm not accustomed
to hunting you down.


1234
01:41:42.474 --> 01:41:45.034
Elizabeth, look at me, please.

1235
01:41:49.648 --> 01:41:52.640
I've spoken with Mrs. Jones.
There will be no divorce.


1236
01:41:53.919 --> 01:41:57.116
There's always a period
of adjustment.


1237
01:41:57.289 --> 01:42:01.123
I've assured her that you will try
for a year.


1238
01:42:03.696 --> 01:42:05.994
Look at this, Mother.

1239
01:42:10.836 --> 01:42:13.031
Spencer will try as well.

1240
01:42:13.205 --> 01:42:17.403
According to her, he's really
very upset. You should call him.


1241
01:42:17.576 --> 01:42:21.535
She's smiling. Is she happy?

1242
01:42:22.948 --> 01:42:26.782
The important thing
is not to tell anyone.


1243
01:42:26.952 --> 01:42:28.681
She looks happy.

1244
01:42:29.221 --> 01:42:31.553
So, what does it matter?

1245
01:42:32.224 --> 01:42:36.558
Don't wash your dirty laundry
in public.


1246
01:42:36.862 --> 01:42:39.490
Let me tell you something.

1247
01:42:40.766 --> 01:42:44.224
Not everything is as it seems.

1248
01:43:03.455 --> 01:43:05.980
Dear Miss Watson:

1249
01:43:06.158 --> 01:43:08.319
It is with great pleasure...

1250
01:43:08.494 --> 01:43:10.689
...that we invite you...

1251
01:43:10.863 --> 01:43:14.321
...to return as an instructor...

1252
01:43:14.500 --> 01:43:16.832
...in the Art History department...

1253
01:43:17.002 --> 01:43:22.634
...for the 1954-1955
academic year.


1254
01:43:22.808 --> 01:43:27.677
We do wish to make clear, however,
that this invitation...


1255
01:43:27.846 --> 01:43:33.307
...is absolutely conditional
upon the following:


1256
01:43:34.853 --> 01:43:37.048
Please, Nora, may we continue?

1257
01:43:37.222 --> 01:43:39.315
Number one:

1258
01:43:39.825 --> 01:43:45.058
You will teach only the syllabus
as outlined by the department chair.


1259
01:43:45.998 --> 01:43:47.693
Number two:

1260
01:43:47.866 --> 01:43:49.766
All lesson plans...

1261
01:43:49.935 --> 01:43:55.202
...must be submitted at the beginning
of every term for approval...


1262
01:43:55.374 --> 01:43:57.501
...and revision.

1263
01:43:57.676 --> 01:43:59.041
Number three:

1264
01:43:59.211 --> 01:44:03.307
You shall not provide counsel
beyond your own subject...


1265
01:44:03.482 --> 01:44:06.508
...for any student at any time.

1266
01:44:06.685 --> 01:44:08.312
And finally:

1267
01:44:08.487 --> 01:44:13.823
That you will agree to maintain
a strictly professional relationship...


1268
01:44:13.992 --> 01:44:16.586
...with all members of the faculty.

1269
01:44:16.762 --> 01:44:19.230
- Good evening, Katherine.
- Hi, Violet.


1270
01:44:19.631 --> 01:44:23.795
Assuming you accept the conditions,
we look forward to your continuing...


1271
01:44:23.969 --> 01:44:26.199
...to be a part
of our Wellesley tradition.


1272
01:44:34.980 --> 01:44:37.380
Nice party.

1273
01:44:37.549 --> 01:44:39.244
I didn't realize.

1274
01:44:40.352 --> 01:44:42.183
It was a surprise.

1275
01:44:42.387 --> 01:44:45.151
William H. Taft.
What does the letter H stand for?


1276
01:44:45.324 --> 01:44:47.792
- Howard.
- Howard. Yes!


1277
01:44:48.560 --> 01:44:50.391
Howard.

1278
01:44:51.330 --> 01:44:53.321
Oh, it doesn't matter.

1279
01:44:53.499 --> 01:44:57.367
The important thing is
that you'll be back next year.


1280
01:44:57.536 --> 01:44:59.970
Hopefully living here.

1281
01:45:03.008 --> 01:45:07.377
Well, I haven't really thought about
that. They just told me today.


1282
01:45:09.281 --> 01:45:11.579
Well, there's still plenty of time.

1283
01:45:11.950 --> 01:45:14.976
You should be celebrating.

1284
01:45:20.893 --> 01:45:22.622
You're right.

1285
01:45:24.730 --> 01:45:26.755
You're right. Let's celebrate.

1286
01:45:30.068 --> 01:45:33.868
Let's go upstairs and get gussied up
and go out dancing.


1287
01:45:36.208 --> 01:45:40.872
Silly, it's after 8:00.
Strike It Rich is on.


1288
01:45:41.046 --> 01:45:45.039
- Life isn't about Strike It Rich.
- It's a school night.


1289
01:45:45.217 --> 01:45:49.551
- So what?
- So I don't want to go. I'm happy here.


1290
01:45:51.089 --> 01:45:52.386
It's back on.

1291
01:45:55.861 --> 01:45:59.558
- Do you feel good about music...
- Oh, isn't he handsome?


1292
01:46:01.133 --> 01:46:03.067
Watch with me.

1293
01:46:04.803 --> 01:46:10.070
"You talked me into it," says this
oldie. What's the title of this one?


1294
01:46:13.345 --> 01:46:15.438
"You Made Me Love You."

1295
01:46:15.614 --> 01:46:19.311
"You Made Me Love..."
"You Made Me Love You."


1296
01:46:23.388 --> 01:46:26.016
You get all that from looking
at paint on a canvas...


1297
01:46:26.191 --> 01:46:28.921
...and it's her facial expression...

1298
01:46:29.094 --> 01:46:31.221
...her eyes that makes
you think that.


1299
01:46:31.396 --> 01:46:35.162
- I think that makes it interesting.
- The context that it comes from...


1300
01:46:35.334 --> 01:46:36.858
...affects the way we view it.

1301
01:46:37.035 --> 01:46:40.129
I think it provokes us because
it provoked the painter...


1302
01:46:40.305 --> 01:46:43.672
...and in turn, he's kind of sending
that message to us.


1303
01:46:43.842 --> 01:46:47.403
Whether or not it's a good painting
cannot be subjective.


1304
01:46:47.579 --> 01:46:50.343
I feel like I'm missing something.

1305
01:47:43.368 --> 01:47:45.427
It was Joan's idea.

1306
01:47:49.975 --> 01:47:52.034
How else will you remember us?

1307
01:48:35.287 --> 01:48:38.347
- They've invited you back.
- Do you think they made a mistake?


1308
01:48:38.523 --> 01:48:39.956
I do.

1309
01:48:44.730 --> 01:48:48.962
- Elizabeth, I don't see Spencer.
- Excuse me, Mother.


1310
01:48:49.134 --> 01:48:52.535
Miss Watson, can you help me
get in touch with your friend...


1311
01:48:52.704 --> 01:48:53.966
...in Greenwich Village?

1312
01:48:54.139 --> 01:48:56.573
What do you need
in Greenwich Village?


1313
01:48:56.742 --> 01:48:58.141
An apartment.

1314
01:48:59.644 --> 01:49:02.613
I filed for a divorce this morning.

1315
01:49:03.849 --> 01:49:06.943
And since we know
I'm not welcome at your house...


1316
01:49:08.653 --> 01:49:12.817
You remember Giselle Levy?
What did you call her?


1317
01:49:13.725 --> 01:49:16.193
"A New York kike." That's it.

1318
01:49:16.862 --> 01:49:19.660
Well, we're going to be roommates.

1319
01:49:20.766 --> 01:49:22.529
Hi.

1320
01:49:22.701 --> 01:49:26.193
- You ready?
- Yeah.


1321
01:49:38.784 --> 01:49:40.581
You okay?

1322
01:49:42.621 --> 01:49:45.522
- Greenwich Village?
- Yeah. For a while.


1323
01:49:46.324 --> 01:49:48.554
Then, who knows?

1324
01:49:48.727 --> 01:49:52.026
Maybe law school. Yale, even.

1325
01:49:54.266 --> 01:49:56.063
Well...

1326
01:49:56.735 --> 01:50:01.297
...I wouldn't want to come up against
you in any court anywhere.


1327
01:50:01.473 --> 01:50:04.169
Maybe I can drop by next year?

1328
01:50:04.342 --> 01:50:06.640
Keep you on your toes.

1329
01:50:08.747 --> 01:50:10.840
You will be here?

1330
01:50:11.616 --> 01:50:13.607
Miss Watson?

1331
01:50:19.691 --> 01:50:21.591
Dear Betty:

1332
01:50:21.760 --> 01:50:26.629
I came to Wellesley because
I wanted to make a difference.


1333
01:50:27.199 --> 01:50:28.894
But to change for others...

1334
01:50:29.067 --> 01:50:31.228
- is to lie to yourself.

1335
01:50:31.403 --> 01:50:32.700
My teacher...

1336
01:50:32.871 --> 01:50:36.238
...Katherine Watson,
lived by her own definition...


1337
01:50:36.408 --> 01:50:38.672
...and would not compromise that.

1338
01:50:38.844 --> 01:50:41.540
Not even for Wellesley.

1339
01:50:42.180 --> 01:50:45.013
I dedicate this, my last editorial...

1340
01:50:45.183 --> 01:50:47.151
...to an extraordinary woman...

1341
01:50:47.319 --> 01:50:49.219
...who lived by example...

1342
01:50:49.387 --> 01:50:53.414
...and compelled us all to see
the world through new eyes.


1343
01:50:54.659 --> 01:50:58.527
By the time you read this,
she'll be sailing to Europe...


1344
01:50:58.697 --> 01:51:01.598
...where I know she'll find new walls
to break down...


1345
01:51:01.766 --> 01:51:03.734
...and new ideas
to replace them with.


1346
01:51:03.902 --> 01:51:05.995
Hold it, everybody.

1347
01:51:11.843 --> 01:51:14.141
I've heard her called a quitter
for leaving...


1348
01:51:14.312 --> 01:51:16.780
...an aimless wanderer.

1349
01:51:16.948 --> 01:51:21.146
But not all who wander are aimless.

1350
01:51:21.319 --> 01:51:25.813
Especially not those who seek truth
beyond tradition...


1351
01:51:27.826 --> 01:51:30.056
...beyond definition...

1352
01:51:32.764 --> 01:51:34.823
...beyond the image.

1353
01:51:35.267 --> 01:51:37.758
Get the hell out of the way!

1354
01:51:47.279 --> 01:51:49.474
I'll never forget you.

1355
01:51:54.753 --> 01:51:58.985
Betty! Betty!

1356
01:52:28.687 --> 01:52:30.314
What about after this war, Lee?

1357
01:52:30.488 --> 01:52:33.252
Well, this job belongs
to some soldier.


1358
01:52:33.425 --> 01:52:34.687
When he comes back...

1359
01:52:34.859 --> 01:52:37.293
...he can have it.
- Oh, that's swell.
