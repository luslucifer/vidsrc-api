7
00:01:41.614 --> 00:01:44.614
The sunset over Huaguo Mountain is
more beautiful than any fairy tale.

8
00:01:46.638 --> 00:01:49.638
This is what the
monkey remembered about Huaguo Mountain.

9
00:01:51.662 --> 00:01:54.662
The monkey had heard of a legend

10
00:01:55.586 --> 00:01:57.586
in the interior of the Heavenly Kingdom

11
00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.610
Fate controllers control the
destiny of all living things.

12
00:02:00.634 --> 00:02:02.634
Anyhow, Nuwa's stone

13
00:02:02.658 --> 00:02:04.658
use to patch the
sky breaks into a giant

14
00:02:04.682 --> 00:02:06.682
who refused to accept his destiny.

15
00:02:07.606 --> 00:02:09.606
The Kingdom of Heaven states

16
00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.630
that any uncontrollable creature is a demon.

17
00:02:13.654 --> 00:02:15.654
The giant is a devil.

18
00:02:16.578 --> 00:02:18.578
When the gods do
their utmost to destroy it

19
00:02:18.602 --> 00:02:20.602
the devil attacked the Kingdom of Heaven.

20
00:02:20.626 --> 00:02:22.626
The heavens and the earth
are shaken with their wrath.

21
00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.650
But the giant

22
00:02:26.674 --> 00:02:28.674
can be defeated.

23
00:02:29.598 --> 00:02:31.598
Dazzling light split the giant's body into pieces.

24
00:02:31.622 --> 00:02:33.622
And the pieces of his body
fell and spread to the earth.

25
00:02:34.646 --> 00:02:37.646
In the place of the
fall, all living things thrive

26
00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.670
and Huaguo Mountain was born.

27
00:02:40.594 --> 00:02:42.594
The stone's heart that patches the heavenly life

28
00:02:43.618 --> 00:02:45.618
and form slowly into apes.

29
00:02:45.642 --> 00:02:47.642
The monkey regarded Huaguo Mountain as his home

30
00:02:47.666 --> 00:02:49.666
with the sunset as his friend.

31
00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.590
But the Fate Gauge knows him

32
00:02:56.614 --> 00:02:58.614
burning trees

33
00:02:58.638 --> 00:03:00.638
living things froze

34
00:03:00.662 --> 00:03:03.662
Mount Huaguo is missing its existence.

35
00:03:03.686 --> 00:03:07.586
The monkey disappears and so
the earth splits into pieces.

36
00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.610
The ape is very furious

37
00:03:11.634 --> 00:03:14.634
and swear that while he is alive
he will destroy the Kingdom of Heaven

38
00:03:14.658 --> 00:03:16.658
and cause a catastrophe there.

39
00:03:16.682 --> 00:03:18.682
But at that moment the sky

40
00:03:19.606 --> 00:03:21.606
covered by darkness.

THE BOARD OF DESTINY

43
00:03:51.578 --> 00:03:55.578
My Lord, Mount Huaguo has
been destroyed 300 years ago.

44
00:03:55.602 --> 00:03:57.602
Fate controllers run continuously.

45
00:03:57.626 --> 00:04:02.626
The stone's heart had disappeared. 
Nothing else is against the power of the Kingdom of Heaven.

46
00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:20.650
Warning!

47
00:04:22.574 --> 00:04:25.574
now it's been 1000 years of
guard changes in the Providence Council.

48
00:04:25.598 --> 00:04:29.598
The Academy of Destiny is
responsible for selecting the following gods.

49
00:04:29.622 --> 00:04:32.622
You have undergone rigorous selection

50
00:04:32.646 --> 00:04:36.646
from various departments and the wisest with the
greatest potential that will rise as a god.

51
00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.570
You will be divided into

52
00:04:39.594 --> 00:04:41.594
2 sections on your spiritual journey here.

53
00:04:42.618 --> 00:04:47.618
The Celestial Section, selected from
the offspring of the eminent god,

54
00:04:48.642 --> 00:04:51.642
and Section of Earth, the most hardworking student

55
00:04:51.666 --> 00:04:53.666
who travels spiritually in the human world.

56
00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:56.590
Our Queen will award the third peach class

57
00:04:56.614 --> 00:04:58.614
which the Queen of the
West gave herself to her

58
00:04:58.638 --> 00:05:02.638
on the best disciples of the Sky Section.

59
00:05:18.662 --> 00:05:19.662
Azi?

60
00:05:19.686 --> 00:05:21.586
Azi!

61
00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:23.610
The ceremony will begin.

62
00:05:23.634 --> 00:05:25.634
Why are you sitting here?

63
00:05:25.658 --> 00:05:28.658
I do not do anything,
just watch the sun set.

64
00:05:29.582 --> 00:05:31.582
Then I go first. Let's hurry.

65
00:06:06.606 --> 00:06:08.606
Who is it?

66
00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:11.630
Stop!

67
00:06:26.654 --> 00:06:28.654
I always see others eating.

68
00:06:28.678 --> 00:06:30.678
Now it's my turn to feel it myself.

69
00:06:30.702 --> 00:06:32.702
I heard this peach

70
00:06:32.726 --> 00:06:34.726
it feels fresh.

71
00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:38.650
Prince Juling, his peach has come.

72
00:06:39.574 --> 00:06:41.574
Should I bite rather hard?

73
00:06:41.598 --> 00:06:44.598
Hey, where would he take it?

74
00:06:44.622 --> 00:06:46.622
Come on quickly, call him
here and give him a lesson.

75
00:06:46.646 --> 00:06:47.646
Good.

76
00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:49.570
Come here!

77
00:06:49.594 --> 00:06:51.594
Put your press here.

78
00:06:52.618 --> 00:06:54.618
Put your press here.

79
00:06:54.642 --> 00:06:56.642
Sit!

80
00:06:57.666 --> 00:06:59.666
Sit!

81
00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:01.590
What are you doing?

82
00:07:01.614 --> 00:07:02.614
Come on.

83
00:07:02.638 --> 00:07:04.638
Want to kill. / I did not intend.

84
00:07:05.662 --> 00:07:07.662
Catch him.

85
00:07:07.686 --> 00:07:09.586
Are you here to kill me?

86
00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:11.610
I just brought peach here.

87
00:07:14.634 --> 00:07:16.634
Is this peach?

88
00:07:17.658 --> 00:07:19.658
How dare you eat my peach.

89
00:07:20.582 --> 00:07:22.582
Applause!

90
00:07:24.606 --> 00:07:26.606
I'm JuanLian.

91
00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:30.630
Juling, show your respect.

92
00:07:30.654 --> 00:07:32.654
You should not hit women.

93
00:07:33.578 --> 00:07:35.578
I do not have to hit women?

94
00:07:35.602 --> 00:07:37.602
I can also hit men.

95
00:07:48.626 --> 00:07:50.626
You should not hit a man!

96
00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:52.650
Nice!

97
00:07:56.574 --> 00:07:58.574
Stop it. Do not clap!

98
00:07:59.598 --> 00:08:01.598
Get away to hell!

99
00:08:04.622 --> 00:08:06.622
I will protect you.

100
00:09:18.646 --> 00:09:20.646
Nice!

101
00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:31.570
I can not eat peaches?

102
00:09:31.594 --> 00:09:33.594
Why did not you say that?

103
00:09:33.618 --> 00:09:35.618
And then you beat them.

104
00:09:35.642 --> 00:09:37.642
If you're going to fight other people,

105
00:09:38.666 --> 00:09:40.666
fight me.

106
00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:47.590
Hajar him! Reply what he did to me!

107
00:09:47.614 --> 00:09:50.614
Wait, wait, wait ...

108
00:10:22.638 --> 00:10:24.638
Here's better.

109
00:10:32.662 --> 00:10:34.662
I'm sorry, lately

110
00:10:34.686 --> 00:10:36.686
lots of dirt in my ears.

111
00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:03.610
What is wrong? / Students fighting.

112
00:11:03.634 --> 00:11:06.634
Queen Seon Deok, please to
the side room and rest.

113
00:11:08.658 --> 00:11:10.658
Tianpeng.

114
00:11:25.582 --> 00:11:27.582
Do you guys know who I am?

115
00:11:31.606 --> 00:11:33.606
Listen!

116
00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:35.630
Over the next 10,000 years

117
00:11:35.654 --> 00:11:37.654
you will remember my name.

118
00:11:38.578 --> 00:11:40.578
My name is ... / You are.

119
00:11:40.602 --> 00:11:42.602
You're the one who stole the
peach and caused my friend in trouble.

120
00:11:42.626 --> 00:11:44.626
Do you think you're special? 
So you think you can fight?

121
00:11:44.650 --> 00:11:46.650
What are you hitting me for? 
I've saved you, you stupid wizard.

122
00:11:46.674 --> 00:11:48.674
Damn monkey. / Do
I look like a monkey?

123
00:11:48.698 --> 00:11:50.698
You are like a monkey. Damn monkey!

124
00:11:51.622 --> 00:11:53.622
A lowly animal like
you does not even deserve

125
00:11:53.646 --> 00:11:55.646
meladeniku with Chalky.

126
00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:57.570
You...

127
00:11:57.594 --> 00:11:59.594
Who is Chalky?

128
00:12:04.618 --> 00:12:06.618
I know ya.

129
00:12:06.642 --> 00:12:08.642
Listen, what are you sh-sh?

130
00:12:08.666 --> 00:12:10.666
Shh my knees! I'm not done talking yet.

131
00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:14.590
Chalky, let's go.

132
00:12:14.614 --> 00:12:16.614
Da-dah.

133
00:12:26.638 --> 00:12:28.638
My name is ... / No further ado.

134
00:13:57.662 --> 00:13:59.662
Stop!

135
00:14:02.586 --> 00:14:04.586
Get out of your way!

136
00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:26.610
You're late.

137
00:14:26.634 --> 00:14:28.634
Are you hurt?

138
00:14:28.658 --> 00:14:30.658
Certainly not!

139
00:14:32.582 --> 00:14:34.582
And who are you?

140
00:14:34.606 --> 00:14:36.606
I'm Erlang from Guankou Mountains Kunlun,

141
00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:39.630
also known as Yang Jian.

142
00:16:58.654 --> 00:17:00.654
Do you know who I am?

143
00:17:02.578 --> 00:17:04.578
Listen.

144
00:17:04.602 --> 00:17:06.602
Over the next 10,000 years

145
00:17:07.626 --> 00:17:09.626
you will remember my name.

146
00:17:13.650 --> 00:17:15.650
My name is...

147
00:17:16.574 --> 00:17:18.574
Sun

148
00:17:18.598 --> 00:17:20.598
Wu

149
00:17:20.622 --> 00:17:23.622
kong ...

150
00:17:30.646 --> 00:17:32.646
I do not think you will.

151
00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:45.570
Do not think I'm afraid of you. 
I'll teach you to die with this stick.

152
00:17:45.594 --> 00:17:47.594
I'll kill you now.

153
00:17:47.618 --> 00:17:49.618
Now, I will kill you.

154
00:17:49.642 --> 00:17:51.642
Look, what do you see?

155
00:17:54.666 --> 00:17:57.666
His name is Sun Wukong
and not from any Section.

156
00:17:57.690 --> 00:17:59.590
After all, his strength and his magic

157
00:17:59.614 --> 00:18:02.614
has broken a 100-year record
at the Academy of Destiny.

158
00:18:02.638 --> 00:18:04.638
So we break the rules have crippled him.

159
00:18:04.662 --> 00:18:06.662
But we never imagined
... / Queen Seon Deok.

160
00:18:07.586 --> 00:18:09.586
I was wrong. I was
absent at the opening ceremony,

161
00:18:09.610 --> 00:18:11.610
because there is a problem in the big hall, and violates the academy rules. 
It will not happen again.

162
00:18:11.634 --> 00:18:14.634
Just punish the damn monkey. 
Erlang has just returned,

163
00:18:15.658 --> 00:18:17.658
and I told him to
do it. Just law me.

164
00:18:18.582 --> 00:18:20.582
I've told Tianpeng to take care of everything,

165
00:18:20.606 --> 00:18:22.606
but Erlang intervened

166
00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:24.630
breaking academy rules.

167
00:18:36.654 --> 00:18:38.654
I have sent you to spiritual reinforcement,

168
00:18:38.678 --> 00:18:40.578
but 100 years later,

169
00:18:40.602 --> 00:18:42.602
You still behave like this.

170
00:18:42.626 --> 00:18:45.626
Mothers really remember that we did
not meet each other for 100 years.

171
00:18:46.650 --> 00:18:48.650
Mom, I made this.

172
00:18:48.674 --> 00:18:50.674
This can protect the mother.

173
00:18:52.598 --> 00:18:54.598
Take care of yourself.

174
00:19:08.622 --> 00:19:10.622
Tianpeng,

175
00:19:10.646 --> 00:19:12.646
I will always remember you

176
00:19:12.670 --> 00:19:14.670
no matter how many years have passed.

177
00:19:35.594 --> 00:19:38.594
Erlang, you're called Erlang 'right?

178
00:19:39.618 --> 00:19:42.618
Are not you tired of looking so sour?

179
00:19:42.642 --> 00:19:44.642
Did not you look mighty?

180
00:19:44.666 --> 00:19:46.666
But now look at you. 
You're locked up here with me.

181
00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:49.620
The Kingdom of Heaven has rules.

182
00:19:50.644 --> 00:19:52.644
Fighting is a punishable offense.

183
00:19:53.668 --> 00:19:55.668
So you two against me is
the rule of the Kingdom of Heaven.

184
00:19:55.692 --> 00:19:57.692
You're still losing.

185
00:19:58.616 --> 00:20:00.616
Lose? I can not accept.

186
00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:02.640
Let's fight again.

187
00:20:02.664 --> 00:20:04.664
Come on. Start fighting again.

188
00:20:06.588 --> 00:20:08.588
What? Do not you want to fight?

189
00:20:08.612 --> 00:20:12.612
Now I remember. 
The cockroaches were laughing at it

190
00:20:12.636 --> 00:20:14.636
how your mother has
broken the law of gods.

191
00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:17.660
He fell in love with the gods
and is now trapped under Mount Tao.

192
00:20:17.684 --> 00:20:20.584
Then she bore you, a freak who
is not a human being nor a god.

193
00:20:20.608 --> 00:20:22.608
Say it again.

194
00:20:22.632 --> 00:20:24.632
Simply put,

195
00:20:24.656 --> 00:20:26.656
You're a plebeian dog.

196
00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:35.580
Our Queen.

197
00:20:37.604 --> 00:20:39.604
Queen Seon Deok.

198
00:20:39.628 --> 00:20:42.628
Erlang, go back to the Council
of Destiny and wait for me.

199
00:20:44.652 --> 00:20:46.652
What is this? Why
is he allowed to go?

200
00:20:46.676 --> 00:20:49.576
What about me? / Do
you think nobody can control you?

201
00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:52.600
On earth no one can beat me.

202
00:20:52.624 --> 00:20:55.624
So I just came here
to have fun with you gods.

203
00:20:59.648 --> 00:21:01.648
Is that a gift for me?

204
00:21:03.572 --> 00:21:05.572
This gift, certainly not for
me alone but for us all.

205
00:21:09.596 --> 00:21:11.596
That...

206
00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:14.620
a Crown?

207
00:21:14.644 --> 00:21:16.644
Here, give it to me.

208
00:21:22.668 --> 00:21:24.668
Wait a minute.

209
00:21:24.692 --> 00:21:26.692
This is yours?

210
00:21:37.616 --> 00:21:39.616
Just like that?

211
00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:11.440
That ... the damn monkey deserves it.

212
00:22:11.464 --> 00:22:13.664
He was brash about destroying
the great hall, endangering the students

213
00:22:13.688 --> 00:22:15.588
and almost hurt me.

214
00:22:15.612 --> 00:22:17.612
And caused Erlang in trouble.

215
00:22:17.636 --> 00:22:19.636
Queen Seon, just like that,

216
00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:21.660
give me the gold lotus stick

217
00:22:21.684 --> 00:22:23.584
and I will help to discipline him,

218
00:22:23.608 --> 00:22:26.608
and make sure everyone is safe.

219
00:22:26.632 --> 00:22:28.632
You yourself can not keep the discipline.

220
00:22:28.656 --> 00:22:30.656
How can you discipline others?

221
00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:33.580
Please give me this opportunity.

222
00:22:43.604 --> 00:22:45.604
No one can beat him?

223
00:22:58.628 --> 00:23:00.628
Monkey.

224
00:23:02.652 --> 00:23:04.652
They have destroyed Huaguo Mountain

225
00:23:04.676 --> 00:23:06.676
and want to destroy your eternal heart.

226
00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:10.600
They say this is destiny.

227
00:23:15.624 --> 00:23:17.624
The stone's heart,

228
00:23:17.648 --> 00:23:19.648
but i found you.

229
00:23:22.572 --> 00:23:25.572
At first you do not know anything.

230
00:23:26.596 --> 00:23:29.596
To get rid of the
stubbornness, you have to understand everything.

231
00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:33.620
You will be called
Sun Wukong from now on.

232
00:23:36.644 --> 00:23:38.644
As the heart of the rock dwells,

233
00:23:38.668 --> 00:23:41.668
The heavenly kingdom will never let you live.

234
00:23:41.692 --> 00:23:45.592
I must seal your strength in
the form of a human being.

235
00:23:46.616 --> 00:23:48.616
I'll teach you everything I can.

236
00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:52.640
Let me see if
you can change this world.

237
00:24:24.664 --> 00:24:27.664
Do you know why you
can not open your heavenly eyes?

238
00:24:28.588 --> 00:24:30.588
I have sent you to
explore the earth for years,

239
00:24:30.612 --> 00:24:33.612
and though you can distinguish heaven and earth,

240
00:24:33.636 --> 00:24:35.636
You have nothing but your mother and Azi

241
00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:37.660
in your heart.

242
00:24:37.684 --> 00:24:41.584
But as a god, you must
embrace all living things on earth.

243
00:24:41.608 --> 00:24:43.608
You have to get
rid of your personal emotions

244
00:24:43.632 --> 00:24:47.632
before your eyes can open
and give you unlimited power.

245
00:24:47.656 --> 00:24:51.656
Only then can you become a true god.

246
00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:57.580
You're awake.

247
00:25:00.604 --> 00:25:02.604
What are you doing?

248
00:25:02.628 --> 00:25:05.628
Do you do me? What is this?

249
00:25:05.652 --> 00:25:07.652
I help cut it out. 
Do you like it?

250
00:25:14.576 --> 00:25:16.576
Why?

251
00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:19.600
What do you think? /
Why did you cut my hair?

252
00:25:20.624 --> 00:25:22.624
You are...

253
00:25:22.648 --> 00:25:24.648
It suits you to wear, golden headband.

254
00:25:24.672 --> 00:25:27.572
Where's my master's scarf? 
Give me back my shawl.

255
00:25:28.596 --> 00:25:30.596
Your scarf is filthy, 
I help you wash it.

256
00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:33.620
Look, look at you now.

257
00:25:33.644 --> 00:25:35.644
How can I take you
anywhere if you look like that?

258
00:25:35.668 --> 00:25:37.668
See how clean Chalky is.

259
00:25:40.592 --> 00:25:42.592
I do not want to be your servant.

260
00:25:42.616 --> 00:25:45.616
Do you think this can control me?

261
00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:48.640
You underestimated me, Sun ...

262
00:25:48.664 --> 00:25:50.664
Wu ...

263
00:25:50.688 --> 00:25:52.688
Just keep your energy. 
It is the scriptures of the Kingdom of Heaven.

264
00:25:52.712 --> 00:25:54.612
I myself can not take it off.

265
00:25:54.636 --> 00:25:57.636
Right now, only I
can recite the scriptural mantra.

266
00:25:57.660 --> 00:26:00.660
OK. I can accept you

267
00:26:00.684 --> 00:26:02.684
as my servant.

268
00:26:04.608 --> 00:26:06.608
Call me the princess.

269
00:26:06.632 --> 00:26:09.632
Then remove the spell. 
I challenge you.

270
00:26:09.656 --> 00:26:11.656
You do not know who you're dealing with.

271
00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:14.580
I'm from hell. 
My hands are covered in blood.

272
00:26:14.604 --> 00:26:16.604
No rare, old, weak animal,

273
00:26:16.628 --> 00:26:18.628
women and children can escape my wrath.

274
00:26:21.652 --> 00:26:23.652
Daughter, forgive me. / Sit.

275
00:26:24.576 --> 00:26:26.576
Sit!

276
00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:32.600
You are a smart kid.

277
00:26:34.624 --> 00:26:36.624
Smile.

278
00:26:38.648 --> 00:26:40.648
The wizard base is cruel! 
You think I'm scared of you?

279
00:26:54.572 --> 00:26:56.572
What sound is that?

280
00:27:25.596 --> 00:27:27.596
Stop it!

281
00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:35.620
Yesterday I thought you
were a hero of virtue.

282
00:27:35.644 --> 00:27:38.644
Who would have thought you
were trying to act indecent now?

283
00:27:38.668 --> 00:27:40.668
Who told you to come in?

284
00:27:40.692 --> 00:27:42.592
I'm not coming in, I'm down.

285
00:27:42.616 --> 00:27:44.616
Come up again. / Easily
down, but not easy to rise.

286
00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:47.640
Exit! / Pull up me!

287
00:27:47.664 --> 00:27:49.664
You think you can fool me like that?

288
00:27:49.688 --> 00:27:52.588
I can not be deceived. 
Women are very naive.

289
00:27:52.612 --> 00:27:54.612
Get out of there! Go!

290
00:28:01.636 --> 00:28:04.636
This is the kitchen that has the
most beautiful view in the Kingdom of Heaven.

291
00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:06.660
You can stay here.

292
00:28:07.584 --> 00:28:09.584
Then I'll ...

293
00:28:22.608 --> 00:28:24.608
Why?

294
00:28:24.632 --> 00:28:27.632
Why do you destroy so many beautiful places?

295
00:28:27.656 --> 00:28:30.656
I do not understand. 
I do not accept.

296
00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:32.680
Queen Seon Deok, it's all my fault.

297
00:28:32.704 --> 00:28:34.704
Do not rule Azi.

298
00:28:35.628 --> 00:28:39.628
Erlang, your mother has
been imprisoned under Mount Tao.

299
00:28:39.652 --> 00:28:41.652
You are not human or
god and your origin is terrible.

300
00:28:41.676 --> 00:28:43.676
I brought you here from
the Kunlun Mountains and promoted you

301
00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:46.600
because you've never made a mistake.

302
00:28:46.624 --> 00:28:49.624
You really disappoint me. / Erlang,

303
00:28:49.648 --> 00:28:51.648
forgive me, has got you in trouble.

304
00:28:53.572 --> 00:28:55.572
I want to be a great god.

305
00:28:55.596 --> 00:28:57.596
I will save everyone.

306
00:28:57.620 --> 00:28:59.620
I also want to be a great god.

307
00:28:59.644 --> 00:29:01.644
I will always protect you.

308
00:29:09.668 --> 00:29:12.668
Erlang, I'm sorry to
have caused you trouble again.

309
00:29:12.692 --> 00:29:15.592
No problem. / You have long gone down to the human world. 
Have you had a good time?

310
00:29:15.616 --> 00:29:17.616
There's nothing fun down there.

311
00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:20.640
You told me if you like flowers.

312
00:29:22.664 --> 00:29:24.664
This is for you.

313
00:29:25.588 --> 00:29:27.588
What's this?

314
00:29:27.612 --> 00:29:30.612
The most beautiful flower seed
I saw during my journey.

315
00:29:31.636 --> 00:29:34.636
If you like, I can make
the Heavenly Kingdom like the human world

316
00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:36.660
full of flowers.

317
00:29:37.584 --> 00:29:39.584
I will love it.

318
00:29:42.608 --> 00:29:44.608
How has it been since
I left? / He is fine.

319
00:29:44.632 --> 00:29:47.632
See how fat he is. / Very healthy.

320
00:29:47.656 --> 00:29:50.656
Too chubby that his armor would not fit. 
Xiaotian, let's go.

321
00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:52.580
I told you, his name
is Chalky. / But black color.

322
00:29:52.604 --> 00:29:55.604
The color is white. / He's black.

323
00:29:55.628 --> 00:29:57.628
Do not ask me, ask yourself.

324
00:29:57.652 --> 00:29:59.652
Chalky, are you white or black?

325
00:30:00.576 --> 00:30:02.576
I have followed your instructions

326
00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:04.600
and I watched Sun Wukong.

327
00:30:04.624 --> 00:30:06.624
He has a purpose of being here

328
00:30:07.648 --> 00:30:09.648
command it.

329
00:30:11.572 --> 00:30:13.572
Wait for me to make sure first.

330
00:30:26.596 --> 00:30:29.596
You said you wanted to be invincible.

331
00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:33.620
What's so great about being invincible?

332
00:30:34.644 --> 00:30:36.644
At least I can control my own destiny.

333
00:30:41.668 --> 00:30:43.668
All destiny in this world

334
00:30:43.692 --> 00:30:46.592
controlled by the Fate Controller.

335
00:30:46.616 --> 00:30:49.616
With that tool, the Kingdom of
Heaven can balance the three worlds

336
00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:51.640
and master all souls.

337
00:30:51.664 --> 00:30:54.664
Nothing can stop him.

338
00:30:54.688 --> 00:30:58.588
I do not care. 
I will go to the Kingdom of Heaven and destroy it.

339
00:31:04.612 --> 00:31:06.612
I will destroy the Fate Controller.

340
00:31:15.636 --> 00:31:19.636
The Providence Council is located
at an altitude of 36 heavens.

341
00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:22.660
This council rules 3 natural, 6 destiny,

342
00:31:22.684 --> 00:31:24.684
5 elements and encourage yin and yang.

343
00:31:37.608 --> 00:31:39.608
Behind this gate

344
00:31:39.632 --> 00:31:42.632
is the magical bridge that
leads to the Fate Controller

345
00:31:42.656 --> 00:31:45.656
also as a divider that separates the
human world and the Kingdom of Heaven.

346
00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:52.580
If you fall, the magical power
will suck up all your eternal powers

347
00:31:52.604 --> 00:31:57.604
and you will disappear
and die without a trace.

348
00:32:12.628 --> 00:32:15.628
This is the control room.

349
00:32:15.652 --> 00:32:17.652
The sky, the earth, the sun, the moon,

350
00:32:17.676 --> 00:32:19.576
wind, thunder, rain, lightning

351
00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:21.600
4 seasons changes,

352
00:32:21.624 --> 00:32:23.624
all the events of
the sky that man witnessed

353
00:32:23.648 --> 00:32:26.648
operated from here.

354
00:32:29.572 --> 00:32:31.572
What are you doing?

355
00:32:31.596 --> 00:32:33.596
I did not do anything.

356
00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:37.620
Do not make trouble in the Kingdom
of Heaven. / If I do, then why?

357
00:32:38.644 --> 00:32:40.644
You're this ... / What do you want?

358
00:32:49.668 --> 00:32:53.668
This is the Fate Controller.

359
00:32:53.692 --> 00:32:56.592
Middle Area within the Providence Council.

360
00:32:56.616 --> 00:33:01.616
Greetings Queen Seon Deok. / Hail the Queen.

361
00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:04.640
The first thing you will learn today

362
00:33:04.664 --> 00:33:07.664
is to understand the
balance between heaven and earth.

363
00:33:11.588 --> 00:33:13.588
This is Huaguo Mountain.

364
00:33:13.612 --> 00:33:17.612
Satan once reincarnated and hid himself here.

365
00:33:22.636 --> 00:33:24.636
300 years ago,

366
00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:27.660
we obey the command of
heaven and destroy the devil.

367
00:33:33.584 --> 00:33:35.584
The fire blazed in the sky for months

368
00:33:35.608 --> 00:33:38.608
and ice covered the mountain for years,

369
00:33:38.632 --> 00:33:40.632
completely cleaned Huaguo Mountain

370
00:33:40.656 --> 00:33:43.656
and finally restore the
balance of heaven and earth.

371
00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:52.580
Now this land must have recovered to life,

372
00:33:52.604 --> 00:33:54.604
but because of the disaster of many years

373
00:33:54.628 --> 00:33:56.628
due to evil spirits
seeping into the ground there,

374
00:33:56.652 --> 00:33:59.652
life is meaningless besides despair.

375
00:33:59.676 --> 00:34:03.576
Chances are, the devil is still alive.

376
00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:09.600
With the pardon of the gods, it is
time to clean the land again from the devil.

377
00:34:12.624 --> 00:34:14.624
Basic rubbish!

378
00:34:20.648 --> 00:34:23.648
It must have been a beautiful land.

379
00:34:23.672 --> 00:34:25.672
Now look like this because of your cruelty.

380
00:34:26.596 --> 00:34:29.596
Why do not you give
them a chance to be reborn?

381
00:34:29.620 --> 00:34:31.620
Those who have sinned, should be punished.

382
00:34:31.644 --> 00:34:33.644
But they do not have to be killed.

383
00:34:33.668 --> 00:34:35.668
I reject any command
from the sky like that.

384
00:34:37.592 --> 00:34:42.592
Answer me, if it was your
own son, would you kill him?

385
00:34:42.616 --> 00:34:45.616
If that's his destiny, 
I'll do it without thinking.

386
00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:51.140
I finally realized why
you treated me like this.

387
00:35:06.664 --> 00:35:08.664
Damn monkey!

388
00:35:08.688 --> 00:35:10.688
Wait for me. 
- Are you done?

389
00:35:10.712 --> 00:35:12.712
You are this ... you are her daughter.

390
00:35:13.636 --> 00:35:15.636
What are you doing? / Revert.

391
00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:18.660
Go away from me.

392
00:35:22.584 --> 00:35:24.584
As I thought.

393
00:35:26.608 --> 00:35:29.608
The stone's heart has not been destroyed.

394
00:35:31.632 --> 00:35:34.632
The devil is alive.

395
00:35:37.656 --> 00:35:39.656
We can not let him
disturb the Kingdom of Heaven.

396
00:35:40.580 --> 00:35:42.580
Find a chance to kill him.

397
00:35:42.604 --> 00:35:44.604
Bring that stone's heart to me.

398
00:35:48.628 --> 00:35:50.628
Azi?

399
00:35:50.652 --> 00:35:52.652
Azi?

400
00:35:59.576 --> 00:36:02.576
You invited me here
and did not say anything?

401
00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:05.600
Why?

402
00:36:42.624 --> 00:36:44.624
The magical bridge is a forbidden
area in the Kingdom of Heaven.

403
00:36:45.648 --> 00:36:47.648
You stole an entry warrant.

404
00:36:48.572 --> 00:36:51.572
You are not here to be a god,

405
00:36:51.596 --> 00:36:53.596
but for other plans.

406
00:36:53.620 --> 00:36:55.620
Already! Enough! Enough!

407
00:36:57.644 --> 00:37:00.344
What's so good about being a god? 
Do you think I can not beat you?

408
00:37:41.668 --> 00:37:43.668
Damn monkey, I want to talk to you.

409
00:37:54.592 --> 00:37:56.592
If you want me, just say it. 
Why hit me unconscious?

410
00:37:58.616 --> 00:38:00.616
Do not do this again. 
- What are you talking about?

411
00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:02.640
Where's that damn monkey?

412
00:38:05.464 --> 00:38:07.464
You go?

413
00:38:15.588 --> 00:38:17.588
Do not waste your time.

414
00:38:34.612 --> 00:38:36.612
Erlang!

415
00:38:39.574 --> 00:38:41.574
Get out of here! / Watch Out!

416
00:39:40.598 --> 00:39:42.598
My meteorite.

417
00:39:48.622 --> 00:39:50.622
They destroyed Huaguo Mountain,

418
00:39:50.646 --> 00:39:52.646
and want to destroy your eternal heart.

419
00:39:52.670 --> 00:39:54.570
They say this is destiny

420
00:39:54.594 --> 00:39:56.594
and ice covered the mountain for years,

421
00:39:56.618 --> 00:39:59.618
completely cleaned Huaguo Mountain.

422
00:40:00.642 --> 00:40:03.642
I do not care. 
I will go to the Kingdom of Heaven and destroy it.

423
00:40:03.666 --> 00:40:07.666
Remember, why are you here.

424
00:40:48.590 --> 00:40:58.590
AQUILA    THE BIRD

425
00:41:14.614 --> 00:41:16.614
Azi.

426
00:41:18.638 --> 00:41:20.638
We're not dead yet?

427
00:41:23.662 --> 00:41:25.662
what just happened?

428
00:41:26.586 --> 00:41:28.586
Where is this?

429
00:41:31.610 --> 00:41:33.610
This is Huaguo Mountain.

430
00:41:37.634 --> 00:41:39.634
He was the reincarnation of
the devil 300 years ago.

431
00:41:40.658 --> 00:41:43.658
The stone's heart was blocking the magical storm

432
00:41:43.682 --> 00:41:45.682
then bring us here.

433
00:41:49.606 --> 00:41:51.606
I will not let you back alive.

434
00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:54.630
If I can not go back,

435
00:41:54.654 --> 00:41:56.654
do not think you can come back too.

436
00:41:58.578 --> 00:42:00.578
Then we'll see. 
- Come on.

437
00:42:00.602 --> 00:42:02.602
Come on.

438
00:42:56.626 --> 00:42:58.626
Stop it! Without power, what can you do?

439
00:42:59.650 --> 00:43:01.650
I'm the boss here. 
Frozen potassium-nitrate shooters.

440
00:43:01.674 --> 00:43:04.574
It's a physical phenomenon. 
No need for any magic.

441
00:43:04.598 --> 00:43:06.598
I found it.

442
00:43:06.622 --> 00:43:08.622
Stop, do not fight.

443
00:43:18.646 --> 00:43:20.646
What's this?

444
00:43:20.670 --> 00:43:22.670
Shut up.

445
00:43:23.594 --> 00:43:24.594
Let's kill!

446
00:43:24.618 --> 00:43:26.618
What can we do without power, Azi?

447
00:43:29.642 --> 00:43:31.642
Let's get through!

448
00:43:31.666 --> 00:43:33.666
Here give it.

449
00:43:33.690 --> 00:43:35.690
Azi! Azi!

450
00:43:36.614 --> 00:43:38.614
Back off!

451
00:43:46.638 --> 00:43:48.638
Get out of your way,
stealth! / We are not stealth.

452
00:43:48.662 --> 00:43:51.662
Nonsense. Something that falls
from the sky is stealth.

453
00:43:54.586 --> 00:43:58.586
No, we're not stealth. /
Man, do not forget your attitude.

454
00:43:58.610 --> 00:44:00.610
This does not seem good.

455
00:44:00.634 --> 00:44:02.034
Azi, get out of here. 
I do not want you hurt.

456
00:44:02.035 --> 00:44:04.035
I'll show you the power of my end.

457
00:44:04.659 --> 00:44:06.659
A thousand punches!

458
00:44:16.583 --> 00:44:19.583
It seems there are also
fake stealth. / Catch him.

459
00:44:19.607 --> 00:44:21.607
Kill him.

460
00:44:26.631 --> 00:44:28.631
You want to kill me, finish me off.

461
00:44:30.655 --> 00:44:33.655
I need 300 years. 300 years!

462
00:44:33.679 --> 00:44:35.679
You will never succeed.

463
00:44:35.703 --> 00:44:37.703
Even though it took me another 3000 years,

464
00:44:37.727 --> 00:44:39.727
or 30,000 years, 
I will never lose.

465
00:44:45.651 --> 00:44:47.651
Stealth clouds have come.

466
00:44:47.675 --> 00:44:49.675
Stealth clouds have come.

467
00:44:50.599 --> 00:44:53.599
Stealth clouds! / The stealth clouds have arrived.

468
00:45:21.623 --> 00:45:23.623
Wait! Wait...

469
00:45:35.647 --> 00:45:37.647
Hide! 
- Quick login!

470
00:45:45.571 --> 00:45:47.571
Azi! Do not worry.

471
00:45:52.595 --> 00:45:54.595
Village head!

472
00:45:54.619 --> 00:45:56.619
My child.

473
00:45:56.643 --> 00:45:58.643
Village head! / Your child?

474
00:45:58.667 --> 00:46:01.667
My son is not here!
/ Who sees his son?

475
00:46:04.591 --> 00:46:06.591
The child is there.

476
00:46:12.615 --> 00:46:16.615
My child.

477
00:46:17.639 --> 00:46:19.639
Do not go out there.

478
00:46:21.663 --> 00:46:23.663
There are people out there.

479
00:46:23.687 --> 00:46:25.687
Do not go.

480
00:46:28.611 --> 00:46:30.611
Do not worry.

481
00:46:33.635 --> 00:46:35.635
Ayue.

482
00:46:35.659 --> 00:46:37.659
The day we meet,

483
00:46:38.583 --> 00:46:40.583
the stars are burning in my life.

484
00:46:41.607 --> 00:46:43.607
The heavenly kingdom drove
you into the human world.

485
00:46:43.631 --> 00:46:46.631
But I will not let
you face this punishment alone.

486
00:46:48.655 --> 00:46:50.655
I'll come with you.

487
00:47:09.579 --> 00:47:11.579
You are the keeper of the stars.

488
00:47:11.603 --> 00:47:13.603
You have to stay here,

489
00:47:13.627 --> 00:47:15.627
protect the world.

490
00:47:16.651 --> 00:47:18.651
and the stars.

491
00:47:18.675 --> 00:47:20.675
All I want to protect is you.

492
00:47:25.599 --> 00:47:27.599
Run!

493
00:47:30.623 --> 00:47:32.623
Give her to me.

494
00:47:32.647 --> 00:47:34.647
You can not go out there.

495
00:47:34.671 --> 00:47:36.671
You'll die when you get out.

496
00:47:47.595 --> 00:47:50.595
Do you remember the meteorite I gave you?

497
00:47:51.619 --> 00:47:53.619
As long as we still have the meteorite

498
00:47:53.643 --> 00:47:55.643
no matter wherever I go,

499
00:47:55.667 --> 00:47:57.667
I will always remember you.

500
00:48:14.591 --> 00:48:16.591
Damn monkey!

501
00:48:31.615 --> 00:48:34.615
Azi! My magic weapon can stop him.

502
00:48:34.639 --> 00:48:36.639
Fire it, now, now!

503
00:49:17.663 --> 00:49:19.663
Ayue.

504
00:49:27.587 --> 00:49:30.587
Queen Seon, the magical bridge has been destroyed

505
00:49:30.611 --> 00:49:32.611
and Azi fell.

506
00:49:32.635 --> 00:49:36.635
The magical storm caused
damage to the Fate Device.

507
00:49:36.659 --> 00:49:38.659
Soon we will make it work again,

508
00:49:38.683 --> 00:49:40.683
we will try hard to find him.

509
00:49:41.607 --> 00:49:44.607
Also, the Ruler sees this problem.

510
00:49:59.631 --> 00:50:02.631
Take a break. You do
not even have the strength.

511
00:50:02.655 --> 00:50:04.655
You can not take that rope off.

512
00:50:07.579 --> 00:50:09.579
Let me go. / How can I release you? 
I myself am bound.

513
00:50:13.603 --> 00:50:15.603
Are you awake? /
Damn witch, let me go!

514
00:50:21.627 --> 00:50:23.627
Sit!

515
00:50:23.651 --> 00:50:25.651
This is the last grain of the villagers.

516
00:50:25.675 --> 00:50:27.675
They give this to us
as an expression of gratitude.

517
00:50:27.699 --> 00:50:30.599
They believe that we are real gods
and we are here to save them.

518
00:50:31.623 --> 00:50:33.623
Stealth clouds absorb all their water supplies.

519
00:50:33.647 --> 00:50:35.647
They can no longer grow rice.

520
00:50:35.671 --> 00:50:37.671
Besides, we can not go back.

521
00:50:37.695 --> 00:50:39.695
And the stealth clouds will appear again.

522
00:50:40.619 --> 00:50:42.619
I have decided

523
00:50:42.643 --> 00:50:44.643
if we will stay here and save them.

524
00:50:47.667 --> 00:50:49.667
Save them? Why?

525
00:50:50.591 --> 00:50:52.591
Correct. Why?

526
00:50:53.615 --> 00:50:55.615
What do you mean?

527
00:50:55.639 --> 00:50:58.639
They can not be saved because
you are gods who decide everything.

528
00:50:58.663 --> 00:51:00.663
If you want to save them,
you must destroy the Fate Control Device.

529
00:51:00.687 --> 00:51:02.687
That's the only way they
can control their own destiny.

530
00:51:02.711 --> 00:51:05.611
Destiny is determined. 
Nothing can change destiny.

531
00:51:06.635 --> 00:51:08.635
Erlang.

532
00:51:09.659 --> 00:51:11.659
You're crazy.

533
00:51:11.683 --> 00:51:14.383
You want to be punished again? / Who
do you think that you think is stupid?

534
00:51:14.607 --> 00:51:16.607
We have no strength anymore. 
And your weapon is useless.

535
00:51:17.631 --> 00:51:19.631
Get out of your way!
/ Where are you going?

536
00:51:22.655 --> 00:51:24.655
Move!

537
00:51:29.579 --> 00:51:31.579
What do you guys see?

538
00:51:31.603 --> 00:51:33.603
One's destiny can not be denied.

539
00:51:34.627 --> 00:51:36.627
Azi.

540
00:51:36.651 --> 00:51:38.651
300 years ago,

541
00:51:38.675 --> 00:51:40.575
this is Huaguo Mountain.

542
00:51:40.599 --> 00:51:42.599
Look at this place.

543
00:51:42.623 --> 00:51:44.623
What exactly can we do?

544
00:51:44.647 --> 00:51:47.647
Mother said if this place is hopeless again.

545
00:51:47.671 --> 00:51:49.671
But I've seen hope here.

546
00:51:51.595 --> 00:51:53.595
I believe that the
Ruler will see it too.

547
00:51:54.619 --> 00:51:57.619
Erlang, you told me

548
00:51:57.643 --> 00:51:59.643
no matter wherever I
am, if I want it,

549
00:51:59.667 --> 00:52:02.667
you will plant a
sea of ​​flowers for me.

550
00:52:17.591 --> 00:52:20.591
I want the flowers to bloom here.

551
00:53:00.615 --> 00:53:02.615
You're awake. / Ayue ...

552
00:53:05.639 --> 00:53:07.639
I've finally found you.

553
00:53:11.663 --> 00:53:13.663
God, forgive me. 
I did not mean to offend you.

554
00:53:13.687 --> 00:53:17.587
You've saved our village,
but now we have nothing.

555
00:53:17.611 --> 00:53:20.611
That was the last water we had.

556
00:53:21.635 --> 00:53:23.635
I...

557
00:53:23.659 --> 00:53:26.659
Your shirt, I've fixed.

558
00:53:27.583 --> 00:53:29.583
I hope you do not mind.

559
00:53:33.607 --> 00:53:35.607
This stone ...

560
00:53:36.631 --> 00:53:38.631
I have this stone
since I was a kid.

561
00:53:38.655 --> 00:53:40.655
Please can not take this stone from me?

562
00:53:41.579 --> 00:53:43.579
I'm sorry ...

563
00:53:56.603 --> 00:53:58.603
Is there water there? 
- No water.

564
00:53:58.627 --> 00:54:00.627
Nothing.

565
00:54:01.651 --> 00:54:03.651
I told you before. 
- Where are you?

566
00:54:03.675 --> 00:54:06.575
I've been looking for you everywhere ...

567
00:54:06.599 --> 00:54:09.599
I can not find you
anywhere. / He is a god.

568
00:54:09.623 --> 00:54:10.623
Madam. / No.

569
00:54:10.647 --> 00:54:13.647
That's Fengshou. She's my son.

570
00:54:13.671 --> 00:54:16.371
Do not talk nonsense. 
Fengshou is dead. 
- He's not dead yet.

571
00:54:24.595 --> 00:54:26.595
This is Huaguo Mountain, right?

572
00:54:27.619 --> 00:54:29.619
I really like this place.

573
00:54:30.643 --> 00:54:32.643
Do not tell me
again this is Huaguo Mountain.

574
00:54:33.667 --> 00:54:35.667
There is nowhere to see the sunset.

575
00:54:39.591 --> 00:54:41.591
The Kingdom of Heaven has taken your sunset,

576
00:54:42.615 --> 00:54:45.615
so we will go and take it back.

577
00:54:49.639 --> 00:54:51.639
I'll help you with this.

578
00:55:04.663 --> 00:55:06.663
Everything, here. 
Come here, come here.

579
00:55:06.687 --> 00:55:09.587
We decided to stay and help
you to get rid of the stealth.

580
00:55:09.611 --> 00:55:11.611
Nice!

581
00:55:12.635 --> 00:55:15.635
We have checked this issue. 
Stealth clouds absorb water from this soil,

582
00:55:15.659 --> 00:55:17.659
but now no more water can be absorbed

583
00:55:17.683 --> 00:55:19.683
and consuming fluids from people's bodies.

584
00:55:19.707 --> 00:55:21.707
What we want to know is
how to get rid of it.

585
00:55:21.731 --> 00:55:23.631
Really!

586
00:55:23.655 --> 00:55:25.655
Let us think about it. 
I'll think about it, 
I'll think about it.

587
00:55:26.579 --> 00:55:28.579
Shut up!

588
00:55:31.603 --> 00:55:34.603
We must not waste time waiting
for the silent to appear again.

589
00:55:35.627 --> 00:55:38.627
We have to drag
him out and catch him.

590
00:55:38.651 --> 00:55:40.651
How do we catch it?
/ The best defense is attacking.

591
00:55:40.675 --> 00:55:42.675
We will

592
00:55:44.599 --> 00:55:46.599
catch the cloud. / Nonsense.

593
00:55:47.623 --> 00:55:49.623
I have a very different idea.

594
00:55:49.647 --> 00:55:51.647
How to solve this problem

595
00:55:51.671 --> 00:55:53.671
is forcing it out, and cornering it.

596
00:55:54.595 --> 00:55:57.595
Then surround and attack him. /
What's the difference with my idea?

597
00:55:57.619 --> 00:55:59.619
I have a plan, you do not.

598
00:55:59.620 --> 00:56:01.020
I did not. How do
you know I have no plans?

599
00:56:01.021 --> 00:56:03.021
Then tell us. / You will not understand.

600
00:56:03.045 --> 00:56:04.845
Just try it. /
Why should I tell you?

601
00:56:04.869 --> 00:56:06.069
Up to you. 
- I'll tell you.

602
00:56:06.070 --> 00:56:08.570
I will not listen. / I'll
tell you what. / It is enough!

603
00:56:08.594 --> 00:56:10.594
Be silent if you do not know.

604
00:56:11.618 --> 00:56:14.618
The stealth cloud is the cloud
god of the Kingdom of Heaven.

605
00:56:14.642 --> 00:56:16.642
Have roamed here and started
to absorb hatred on Huaguo Mountain,

606
00:56:16.666 --> 00:56:18.666
which turned it into a stealth.

607
00:56:18.690 --> 00:56:20.690
He has taken the
most precious thing from me.

608
00:56:20.714 --> 00:56:22.714
And I want to take it back. 
I can do this myself.

609
00:56:24.638 --> 00:56:27.638
We believe that the gods can
help us get rid of the ghost.

610
00:56:30.662 --> 00:56:32.662
Stealth clouds are above the sky

611
00:56:32.686 --> 00:56:35.586
and we have to lure him
down by creating a sunset view.

612
00:56:35.610 --> 00:56:37.610
We can lure him down
or we can force him down

613
00:56:37.634 --> 00:56:39.634
we will trap here, surround it

614
00:56:39.658 --> 00:56:41.658
then catch him. / Well ...

615
00:56:41.682 --> 00:56:43.682
creating a sunset is very unlikely.

616
00:56:43.706 --> 00:56:45.606
Why not?

617
00:56:45.630 --> 00:56:47.630
I've thought about it. Nothing here.

618
00:56:47.654 --> 00:56:49.654
All we have is fabric. 
So we just wear cloth

619
00:56:49.678 --> 00:56:51.678
to create a sunset view.

620
00:56:51.702 --> 00:56:53.702
Come on. / Good.

621
00:56:58.626 --> 00:57:00.626
Although we can lure him down, then how?

622
00:57:00.650 --> 00:57:02.650
Your weapons are quite effective against the clouds.

623
00:57:02.674 --> 00:57:04.674
But the clouds are very big. 
We can make a big super cannon.

624
00:57:04.698 --> 00:57:07.598
Make me an arrow bow. 
Improve its consistency

625
00:57:07.622 --> 00:57:09.622
accuracy and range of fire.

626
00:57:09.646 --> 00:57:11.646
Most importantly, 
I need a light one. / I need a big one!

627
00:57:12.570 --> 00:57:14.570
Very big! Buesar!

628
00:57:16.594 --> 00:57:18.594
I'll put it here. How?

629
00:57:18.618 --> 00:57:20.618
Let's try it first.

630
00:57:22.642 --> 00:57:24.642
This will not work.

631
00:57:24.666 --> 00:57:26.666
Erlang, it's done. 
Is this big enough?

632
00:57:26.690 --> 00:57:28.690
What do you think? 
Looks good, right?

633
00:57:30.614 --> 00:57:32.614
It's not big.

634
00:57:32.638 --> 00:57:34.638
It's less light.

635
00:57:34.662 --> 00:57:36.662
I want a big one.

636
00:57:43.586 --> 00:57:45.586
How can we catch
the cloud with this cage?

637
00:57:46.610 --> 00:57:48.610
So yes

638
00:57:48.634 --> 00:57:50.634
I'm sorry ...

639
00:57:56.658 --> 00:57:58.658
Attack the cloud! 
Capture the cloud!

640
00:57:58.682 --> 00:58:00.682
Attack the cloud! 
Capture the cloud!

641
00:58:05.606 --> 00:58:07.606
Wukong, look at this, take a look. See!

642
00:58:07.630 --> 00:58:09.630
Large enough? Is it big enough?

643
00:58:12.654 --> 00:58:14.654
It's pretty light.

644
00:58:16.578 --> 00:58:18.578
What do you think? 
It's good, is not it?

645
00:58:19.602 --> 00:58:22.602
Let's work together.

646
00:58:22.626 --> 00:58:24.626
Let's make it rain. 
- Let's make it rain.

647
00:58:24.650 --> 00:58:26.650
Be ready to attack the clouds.

648
00:58:27.574 --> 00:58:30.574
If the sleeves of potassium-nitrate guns are firing

649
00:58:30.598 --> 00:58:32.598
we will be able
to freeze the stealth clouds.

650
00:58:35.622 --> 00:58:37.622
Nice!

651
00:58:44.646 --> 00:58:46.646
Watch Out!

652
00:58:49.570 --> 00:58:52.570
Next, we will plug the fabric

653
00:58:53.594 --> 00:58:56.594
Here, please. / I
think it should be installed

654
00:58:56.618 --> 00:58:58.618
Here, please.

655
00:58:58.642 --> 00:59:00.642
Here, please? / Correct.

656
00:59:00.666 --> 00:59:02.666
Not. Here.

657
00:59:08.590 --> 00:59:10.590
It's up to you.

658
00:59:16.614 --> 00:59:18.614
Come here. Come here. Come here!

659
00:59:19.638 --> 00:59:21.638
Come here!

660
00:59:21.662 --> 00:59:23.662
I have good food.

661
00:59:24.586 --> 00:59:26.586
Everyone in this village

662
00:59:27.610 --> 00:59:29.610
saying you're dead.

663
00:59:31.634 --> 00:59:33.634
I told them you're not dead yet.

664
00:59:34.658 --> 00:59:36.658
It's sweet potatoes. Eat.

665
00:59:37.582 --> 00:59:39.582
Eat.

666
00:59:45.606 --> 00:59:48.606
My son. My son!

667
00:59:58.630 --> 01:00:00.630
Here.

668
01:00:03.654 --> 01:00:05.654
Do not open your eyes.

669
01:00:06.578 --> 01:00:07.578
One...

670
01:00:07.602 --> 01:00:09.602
Two...

671
01:00:09.626 --> 01:00:11.626
Three.

672
01:00:17.650 --> 01:00:19.650
It's beautiful.

673
01:00:19.674 --> 01:00:21.674
There are no stars in
the sky here. From now on,

674
01:00:21.698 --> 01:00:23.698
you will be able to see
the stars whenever you open your eyes.

675
01:01:18.622 --> 01:01:21.622
If you want, I will make the Kingdom
of the Sky similar to the human world

676
01:01:21.646 --> 01:01:23.646
full of flowers.

677
01:01:23.670 --> 01:01:25.670
I'll love it.

678
01:01:33.594 --> 01:01:35.594
Pull!

679
01:01:35.618 --> 01:01:37.618
Lift!

680
01:01:37.642 --> 01:01:39.642
Pull! Lift!

681
01:01:40.666 --> 01:01:42.666
Pull!

682
01:01:42.690 --> 01:01:44.690
Nice!

683
01:02:09.614 --> 01:02:13.614
The clouds are coming!

684
01:02:16.638 --> 01:02:19.638
It's dark now! 
Light the sun sinking.

685
01:02:22.662 --> 01:02:24.662
The fabric is falling!

686
01:02:27.586 --> 01:02:29.586
Cloud attackers, follow me. Hurry up.

687
01:02:29.610 --> 01:02:31.610
good

688
01:02:32.634 --> 01:02:35.634
I'll take the kids to hide. 
Come on, come with me.

689
01:02:35.658 --> 01:02:37.658
Fast

690
01:02:43.582 --> 01:02:45.582
I'm going to get his potassium-nitrate cannon.

691
01:02:57.606 --> 01:02:59.606
Sun Wukong, hang on there.

692
01:03:30.630 --> 01:03:32.630
I will help you.

693
01:03:33.654 --> 01:03:35.654
Let's hurry, everybody, hurry up!

694
01:03:35.678 --> 01:03:37.678
Fast!

695
01:03:48.602 --> 01:03:50.602
Pull!

696
01:04:01.626 --> 01:04:03.626
Come here, and get this.

697
01:04:03.650 --> 01:04:05.650
One two three!

698
01:04:12.574 --> 01:04:14.574
Fast!

699
01:04:14.598 --> 01:04:16.598
Give it to me, fast.

700
01:04:17.622 --> 01:04:19.622
Shoot the cloud to the right.

701
01:04:19.646 --> 01:04:21.646
Fast!

702
01:04:24.570 --> 01:04:26.570
Light the sunset.

703
01:04:26.594 --> 01:04:28.594
Leave this to us.

704
01:04:54.618 --> 01:04:56.618
He's coming.

705
01:04:57.642 --> 01:04:59.642
The clouds are too high. 
Lift is higher.

706
01:05:00.666 --> 01:05:02.666
Erlang! 
- Come on! / Good!

707
01:05:16.590 --> 01:05:18.590
Fast!

708
01:05:57.614 --> 01:05:59.614
We have caught it!

709
01:05:59.638 --> 01:06:01.638
We have caught it! 
We have caught it!

710
01:06:01.662 --> 01:06:03.662
We have caught it!

711
01:06:27.586 --> 01:06:28.586
Start raining!

712
01:06:28.610 --> 01:06:30.610
It's raining!

713
01:06:45.634 --> 01:06:48.334
AQUILA    THE BIRD

714
01:06:52.658 --> 01:06:55.658
My lord, this is all my fault.

715
01:06:55.682 --> 01:06:58.582
All this because of an accident.

716
01:06:58.606 --> 01:07:00.606
The magical storm has been overcome.

717
01:07:00.630 --> 01:07:02.630
The Fate Control Equipment functions normally.

718
01:07:02.654 --> 01:07:05.654
The balance between heaven
and earth is not affected.

719
01:07:12.578 --> 01:07:15.578
This time, we are working with

720
01:07:15.602 --> 01:07:17.602
the gods, and make it rain.

721
01:07:17.626 --> 01:07:20.626
All must remember their names.

722
01:07:20.650 --> 01:07:22.650
good

723
01:07:24.574 --> 01:07:26.574
Look. Look.

724
01:07:26.598 --> 01:07:28.598
Just like my stone.

725
01:07:28.622 --> 01:07:30.622
This is half.

726
01:07:30.646 --> 01:07:33.646
Originally this stone was a meteorite. 
Do you remember?

727
01:07:34.570 --> 01:07:36.570
You gave me this.

728
01:07:40.594 --> 01:07:42.594
You told me

729
01:07:43.618 --> 01:07:45.618
as long as we have this meteorite,

730
01:07:45.642 --> 01:07:47.642
you will remember me.

731
01:07:58.666 --> 01:08:00.666
I'm sorry ...

732
01:08:07.590 --> 01:08:09.590
It seems in 200 years

733
01:08:09.614 --> 01:08:12.614
everything can be forgotten.

734
01:08:23.638 --> 01:08:25.638
What is the past

735
01:08:26.662 --> 01:08:28.662
as important as that?

736
01:08:30.586 --> 01:08:32.586
The last few days

737
01:08:34.610 --> 01:08:37.610
with you

738
01:08:41.634 --> 01:08:43.634
became the happiest days of my life.

739
01:08:47.658 --> 01:08:49.658
This time you can put it on me.

740
01:08:51.582 --> 01:08:53.582
How?

741
01:09:00.606 --> 01:09:02.606
Sit down. Sitting.

742
01:09:02.630 --> 01:09:04.630
What will you give me now?

743
01:09:04.654 --> 01:09:06.654
This is your favorite, sweet potato.

744
01:09:09.578 --> 01:09:11.578
It tastes sweet.

745
01:09:21.602 --> 01:09:23.602
I know

746
01:09:23.626 --> 01:09:25.626
if you are not Fengshou.

747
01:09:25.650 --> 01:09:28.650
Fengshou will never return.

748
01:09:29.574 --> 01:09:31.574
After you get back to the sky,

749
01:09:32.598 --> 01:09:34.598
if you meet him,

750
01:09:34.622 --> 01:09:36.622
can you tell her do not worry

751
01:09:37.646 --> 01:09:39.646
for me?

752
01:09:39.670 --> 01:09:41.670
He must be

753
01:09:41.694 --> 01:09:44.594
so a great god.

754
01:09:55.618 --> 01:09:57.618
Honestly, I envy Fengshou.

755
01:10:00.642 --> 01:10:02.642
Over the years,

756
01:10:03.666 --> 01:10:05.666
I never met my mother.

757
01:10:08.590 --> 01:10:10.590
I want to know

758
01:10:12.614 --> 01:10:14.614
what he is doing.

759
01:10:19.638 --> 01:10:21.638
I hope someday I can meet him.

760
01:10:26.662 --> 01:10:29.662
Do not worry. Fengshou
will take care of you.

761
01:10:32.586 --> 01:10:34.586
Good.

762
01:10:38.610 --> 01:10:40.610
I do not know how the
cloud could be attracted to this.

763
01:10:40.634 --> 01:10:43.634
This is actually very unlike the sunset.

764
01:10:44.658 --> 01:10:46.658
But I love it.

765
01:10:50.582 --> 01:10:52.582
You know the golden headband
has no power over you,

766
01:10:52.606 --> 01:10:54.606
why are you still wearing it?

767
01:11:03.630 --> 01:11:05.630
I am used to.

768
01:11:25.654 --> 01:11:27.654
What's this?

769
01:11:27.678 --> 01:11:29.678
A monkey.

770
01:11:29.702 --> 01:11:32.602
It's a dog. Not
at all like a monkey.

771
01:11:32.626 --> 01:11:34.626
Monkeys are not like this.

772
01:11:34.650 --> 01:11:36.650
Just give it back.

773
01:12:10.574 --> 01:12:12.574
I am back.

774
01:12:13.598 --> 01:12:15.598
Although this is not
what it used to be,

775
01:12:18.622 --> 01:12:21.622
I can feel this is my Huaguo Mountain.

776
01:12:48.646 --> 01:12:51.646
I told you. Do you
know why Sun Wukong, Erlang

777
01:12:51.670 --> 01:12:53.670
and Tianpeng really respect me?

778
01:12:53.694 --> 01:12:56.594
Because I have a special
movement called a thousand punches.

779
01:12:56.618 --> 01:12:58.618
If everyone gave me 5 copper coins,

780
01:12:58.642 --> 01:13:00.642
I'll teach you that.

781
01:13:01.666 --> 01:13:03.666
Do you believe me?

782
01:13:03.690 --> 01:13:05.690
I'll give you 3 copper coins.

783
01:13:06.614 --> 01:13:08.614
All right, free.

784
01:13:37.638 --> 01:13:39.638
Go!

785
01:13:49.662 --> 01:13:51.662
Sir, just relax.

786
01:14:01.586 --> 01:14:03.586
Tianpeng.

787
01:14:31.610 --> 01:14:33.610
You do not have to be that serious.

788
01:14:36.634 --> 01:14:38.634
If you want something,

789
01:14:39.658 --> 01:14:41.658
then come here and take your own.

790
01:14:55.582 --> 01:14:57.582
Run!

791
01:15:00.606 --> 01:15:02.606
Where are we going?

792
01:15:02.630 --> 01:15:04.630
He came with the heavenly soldiers.

793
01:15:04.654 --> 01:15:06.654
If we do not
leave now, everyone will die.

794
01:15:06.678 --> 01:15:08.578
Then we have to go.

795
01:15:08.602 --> 01:15:10.602
Come on.

796
01:15:10.626 --> 01:15:12.626
What about the villagers?

797
01:15:15.650 --> 01:15:17.650
Stay inside and do not get out.

798
01:15:17.674 --> 01:15:19.574
Of course!

799
01:15:19.598 --> 01:15:21.598
You run as fast as you can.

800
01:15:21.622 --> 01:15:24.622
We managed to defeat the stealth
clouds, why should we be afraid?

801
01:15:30.646 --> 01:15:32.646
Come on!

802
01:15:35.570 --> 01:15:39.570
Do you still believe in my pounding punch?

803
01:17:19.594 --> 01:17:21.594
God.

804
01:17:24.618 --> 01:17:27.618
How could this happen?

805
01:17:44.642 --> 01:17:46.642
Juanlian.

806
01:17:49.666 --> 01:17:51.666
See if the child ...

807
01:17:52.590 --> 01:17:55.590
still alive. / Child?

808
01:18:14.614 --> 01:18:17.614
The boy is fine. / Then that's great.

809
01:18:22.638 --> 01:18:24.638
Was it my punch

810
01:18:25.662 --> 01:18:27.662
really impressive?

811
01:18:28.586 --> 01:18:30.586
It's impressive.

812
01:18:38.610 --> 01:18:40.610
Juanlian.

813
01:18:41.634 --> 01:18:43.634
Juanlian.

814
01:18:50.658 --> 01:18:52.658
Juanlian.

815
01:19:08.582 --> 01:19:10.582
Ayue?

816
01:19:12.606 --> 01:19:14.606
Ayue?

817
01:19:17.630 --> 01:19:19.630
You must protect the villagers.

818
01:19:20.654 --> 01:19:23.654
And the stars you made for me.

819
01:19:29.578 --> 01:19:31.578
I just want to be with you.

820
01:22:35.602 --> 01:22:37.602
As a god,

821
01:22:37.626 --> 01:22:39.626
you should have no
lust or feelings for yourself.

822
01:22:41.650 --> 01:22:43.650
You must forget your pain

823
01:22:43.674 --> 01:22:45.674
and accept this life as it is.

824
01:22:46.598 --> 01:22:48.598
The day you fall here,

825
01:22:49.622 --> 01:22:51.622
they should have died in this ancient temple.

826
01:22:52.646 --> 01:22:55.646
You have given them false hope,

827
01:22:56.570 --> 01:22:59.570
not bringing anything to them
other than a more painful death.

828
01:23:00.594 --> 01:23:02.594
We are not here to kill people,

829
01:23:02.618 --> 01:23:04.618
but to end a mess.

830
01:23:07.642 --> 01:23:10.642
Do you really think I do
not know what you're up to?

831
01:23:12.666 --> 01:23:14.666
I made you experience all this

832
01:23:15.590 --> 01:23:17.590
to teach you a lesson

833
01:23:18.614 --> 01:23:20.614
that you can not change anything.

834
01:24:11.638 --> 01:24:13.638
Azi.

835
01:24:15.662 --> 01:24:17.662
We were wrong.

836
01:24:17.686 --> 01:24:19.586
Without permission from the sky,

837
01:24:19.610 --> 01:24:22.610
the seeds of the flower will not grow.

838
01:24:26.634 --> 01:24:28.634
While we are in the
village, we are human beings.

839
01:24:29.658 --> 01:24:31.658
He is not a demon

840
01:24:32.582 --> 01:24:34.582
and you are not a god.

841
01:24:36.606 --> 01:24:38.606
But now you are
in the Kingdom of Heaven

842
01:24:39.630 --> 01:24:42.630
and must perform obligations as a god.

843
01:24:46.654 --> 01:24:48.654
He is in brackets in prison under the Holy
-Fire of Fate.

844
01:24:50.578 --> 01:24:52.578
He may feel all the pain,

845
01:24:54.602 --> 01:24:56.602
but still do not want to die.

846
01:24:58.626 --> 01:25:00.626
Because he's waiting for you.

847
01:25:00.650 --> 01:25:03.650
Go and beg him

848
01:25:03.674 --> 01:25:05.674
to forget.

849
01:25:20.598 --> 01:25:22.598
You come.

850
01:25:24.622 --> 01:25:27.622
I thought you'd come.

851
01:25:31.646 --> 01:25:34.646
You keep your pain just to say that?

852
01:25:37.570 --> 01:25:39.570
I want to say

853
01:25:40.594 --> 01:25:42.594
if I liked the ocean on Huaguo Mountain.

854
01:25:42.618 --> 01:25:44.618
Sun Wukong.

855
01:25:47.642 --> 01:25:50.642
See you like this,

856
01:25:51.666 --> 01:25:53.666
I realize you are nothing
but just a handful of shit.

857
01:25:54.590 --> 01:25:56.590
I hate you.

858
01:25:58.614 --> 01:26:00.614
I think you're despicable.

859
01:26:09.638 --> 01:26:11.638
You have lost.

860
01:26:12.662 --> 01:26:14.662
You've lost everything.

861
01:26:31.586 --> 01:26:33.586
Huaguo Mountain has vanished.

862
01:26:34.610 --> 01:26:37.610
The sky over there is
covered with darkness. No sunsets.

863
01:26:49.634 --> 01:26:51.634
So like this?

864
01:26:53.658 --> 01:26:55.658
It is over.

865
01:28:14.582 --> 01:28:16.582
Rest in peace.

866
01:28:16.606 --> 01:28:18.606
I will

867
01:28:19.630 --> 01:28:21.630
complete your mission.

868
01:28:23.654 --> 01:28:26.654
Wait for me. I'll be with you soon.

869
01:28:47.578 --> 01:28:49.578
There was never a single dewapun

870
01:28:49.602 --> 01:28:52.602
who can get the
heart of this eternal stone.

871
01:28:52.626 --> 01:28:54.626
You did it.

872
01:28:55.650 --> 01:28:57.650
Erlang

873
01:28:57.674 --> 01:29:01.574
this exam, finally teaching you to
forget your bond to the earth.

874
01:29:02.598 --> 01:29:06.598
Now, I'll help you open your eyes.

875
01:29:37.622 --> 01:29:39.622
After so much suffering,

876
01:29:40.646 --> 01:29:42.646
You come back here again.

877
01:29:43.570 --> 01:29:45.570
You want to seek revenge for Mountain Huaguo

878
01:29:45.594 --> 01:29:47.594
and defeating the gods.

879
01:29:50.618 --> 01:29:52.618
Have you done that already?

880
01:29:55.642 --> 01:29:57.642
I can not.

881
01:29:58.666 --> 01:30:00.666
Huaguo Mountain is gone.

882
01:30:00.690 --> 01:30:02.690
The stone's heart was gone.

883
01:30:02.714 --> 01:30:04.714
Everything is doomed.

884
01:30:05.638 --> 01:30:07.638
I lose.

885
01:30:08.662 --> 01:30:10.662
Helplessness

886
01:30:10.686 --> 01:30:13.586
only the beginning of your resurrection.

887
01:30:15.610 --> 01:30:18.610
Do you really think there's
no other way for you?

888
01:30:18.634 --> 01:30:20.634
Do you accept your destiny?

889
01:30:22.658 --> 01:30:25.658
Or will you continue to
fight for what's in your heart?

890
01:30:34.582 --> 01:30:37.582
No matter how strong the stone heart is,

891
01:30:37.606 --> 01:30:40.606
it's still one part Nuwa
used to patch the sky.

892
01:30:41.630 --> 01:30:46.630
Using this to drop
its power will not work.

893
01:30:46.654 --> 01:30:49.654
You still have not
found the weapon you need.

894
01:30:49.678 --> 01:30:52.578
Think about the life you have lived,

895
01:30:56.602 --> 01:30:58.602
who have you met,

896
01:30:59.626 --> 01:31:02.626
and all that you can not forget.

897
01:31:03.650 --> 01:31:05.650
Now you have

898
01:31:05.674 --> 01:31:08.574
a force never witnessed
by the Kingdom of Heaven.

899
01:32:53.598 --> 01:32:56.598
"The Great Wisdom, the Equivalent of Heaven"

900
01:32:58.622 --> 01:33:00.622
The stealth.

901
01:33:00.646 --> 01:33:02.646
Take me to the sky.

902
01:33:45.570 --> 01:33:49.570
I was commissioned by the Lord
to protect the Council of Destiny.

903
01:33:49.594 --> 01:33:52.594
Who is sassy making a troublemakers here?

904
01:33:52.618 --> 01:33:54.618
Show yourself!

905
01:34:49.642 --> 01:34:52.642
Who are you? Who exactly are you?

906
01:34:52.666 --> 01:34:54.666
For the rest of your life

907
01:34:55.590 --> 01:34:57.590
you will remember my name.

908
01:35:04.614 --> 01:35:05.614
My name is...

909
01:35:05.638 --> 01:35:08.638
The Great Wisdom, 
Equivalent Heaven

910
01:35:09.662 --> 01:35:11.662
Sun

911
01:35:11.686 --> 01:35:12.686
Wu

912
01:35:12.710 --> 01:35:14.710
kong!

913
01:35:22.634 --> 01:35:24.634
I really can not tell
the difference between you all.

914
01:35:24.658 --> 01:35:27.658
Anyway, everyone is wearing a mask

915
01:35:28.582 --> 01:35:30.582
do not expect to
get out of here alive.

916
01:37:16.606 --> 01:37:18.606
You seem to understand, too.

917
01:37:26.630 --> 01:37:28.630
They're all dead.

918
01:37:29.654 --> 01:37:31.654
You call it fate.

919
01:37:31.678 --> 01:37:33.678
All must obey.

920
01:37:34.602 --> 01:37:36.602
It turns out that you are the
only one who can control your destiny.

921
01:37:37.626 --> 01:37:39.626
Your hands have been covered in blood

922
01:37:39.650 --> 01:37:42.650
in the name of the
balance of heaven and earth.

923
01:37:42.674 --> 01:37:44.674
But all you want is

924
01:37:44.698 --> 01:37:47.598
Sun Wukong's heart stone.

925
01:37:47.622 --> 01:37:49.622
You want to increase your strength

926
01:37:49.646 --> 01:37:51.646
and continue your rules.

927
01:37:54.570 --> 01:37:56.570
And now you want to
turn Erlang into like you.

928
01:37:56.594 --> 01:37:58.594
I will not let that happen!

929
01:38:24.618 --> 01:38:26.618
You came too.

930
01:39:13.642 --> 01:39:15.642
Get off me!

931
01:39:18.666 --> 01:39:20.666
I said let go.

932
01:39:21.590 --> 01:39:24.590
Why should you always oppose me?

933
01:39:25.614 --> 01:39:27.614
I already told you

934
01:39:27.638 --> 01:39:29.638
if I could just kill you

935
01:39:29.662 --> 01:39:31.662
whenever I want.

936
01:40:05.586 --> 01:40:08.586
You know you can not change anything.

937
01:40:09.610 --> 01:40:12.610
Why are you here looking for death?

938
01:40:12.634 --> 01:40:16.634
I'm not like you. 
I can not live my life alone.

939
01:40:48.658 --> 01:40:52.658
Why do you come back
but look like a dog?

940
01:40:54.582 --> 01:40:56.582
This is what my true nature looks like.

941
01:40:58.606 --> 01:41:00.606
I'm ugly right?

942
01:41:00.630 --> 01:41:02.630
I like you like this.

943
01:41:04.654 --> 01:41:06.654
You look very cute.

944
01:41:13.578 --> 01:41:15.578
In the future I will be your servant.

945
01:41:22.602 --> 01:41:24.602
In the future

946
01:41:24.626 --> 01:41:26.626
you will be free.

947
01:41:27.650 --> 01:41:29.650
Nobody makes you do anything.

948
01:41:29.674 --> 01:41:32.574
You can do anything you want.

949
01:41:34.598 --> 01:41:37.598
Then I'll take you to
Huaguo Mountain to see the sunset.

950
01:42:07.622 --> 01:42:09.622
What sound is that?

951
01:43:29.646 --> 01:43:31.646
The Kingdom of Heaven has taken your sunset.

952
01:43:32.570 --> 01:43:34.570
then we will go and take it back.

953
01:43:36.594 --> 01:43:38.594
I can feel

954
01:43:38.618 --> 01:43:40.618
if this is Huaguo Mountain.

955
01:44:09.642 --> 01:44:11.642
What is the past

956
01:44:12.666 --> 01:44:14.666
is that as important as that?

957
01:44:16.590 --> 01:44:18.590
Last few days with you

958
01:44:19.614 --> 01:44:21.614
became the happiest days of my life.

959
01:47:37.638 --> 01:47:39.638
Yang Jian is already a god

960
01:47:39.662 --> 01:47:41.662
and the eyes of the heavens have opened.

961
01:47:41.686 --> 01:47:43.686
He has no desire, and reaches infinity.

962
01:47:43.710 --> 01:47:45.710
All he can see is heaven and earth.

963
01:47:46.634 --> 01:47:48.634
You can not defeat the
power of heaven and earth.

964
01:47:49.658 --> 01:47:51.658
Heaven wants to hold me back,

965
01:47:51.682 --> 01:47:53.582
then I will split the heavens.

966
01:47:53.606 --> 01:47:56.606
The earth wants to stop
me, it will crush the earth.

967
01:49:52.630 --> 01:49:55.630
Finally you understand

968
01:49:56.654 --> 01:49:58.654
your true strength.

969
01:50:49.578 --> 01:50:51.578
Why you still can not forget it?

970
01:50:51.602 --> 01:50:54.602
Why can not you understand your destiny?

971
01:50:57.626 --> 01:50:59.626
Stop lying.

972
01:51:00.650 --> 01:51:02.650
This is your destiny.

973
01:51:02.674 --> 01:51:05.574
Not my destiny.

974
01:51:26.598 --> 01:51:28.598
The Kingdom of Heaven is in turmoil.

975
01:51:28.622 --> 01:51:31.622
The gods are not good. 
Redefine the order of heaven and earth

976
01:51:31.646 --> 01:51:34.646
is my true destiny.

977
01:51:34.670 --> 01:51:36.670
Your obsession is useless

978
01:51:36.694 --> 01:51:38.694
nothing to do but betrayal.

979
01:51:59.618 --> 01:52:01.618
I know the anger of heaven.

980
01:52:02.642 --> 01:52:05.642
But do you know the sky

981
01:52:05.666 --> 01:52:07.666
might it vibrate?

982
01:54:37.590 --> 01:54:39.590
Sun Wukong.

983
01:54:41.614 --> 01:54:43.614
Even by defeating the Equipment of Destiny

984
01:54:44.638 --> 01:54:46.638
there's nothing you can change.

985
01:54:49.662 --> 01:54:51.662
I come,

986
01:54:52.586 --> 01:54:54.586
I'm fighting

987
01:54:55.610 --> 01:54:57.610
and I do not care about the consequences.

988
01:54:59.634 --> 01:55:02.634
Today, Azi has saved you.

989
01:55:04.658 --> 01:55:06.658
But from now on,

990
01:55:12.582 --> 01:55:14.582
I am a god

991
01:55:14.606 --> 01:55:16.606
and you are a devil.

992
01:55:16.630 --> 01:55:18.630
I will always seek your destruction.

993
01:55:30.654 --> 01:55:32.654
Next time we meet,

994
01:55:35.578 --> 01:55:37.578
