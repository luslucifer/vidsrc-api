1
00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:49.360
Aww.

2
00:03:29.835 --> 00:03:32.075
It's Mathieu.

3
00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:34.468
Perfect charm as always.

4
00:03:34.492 --> 00:03:37.234
And it's already achieved
the desired results.


5
00:03:40.107 --> 00:03:41.606
Now listen.

6
00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.087
We're both going to have
to lay low for a while.


7
00:03:44.111 --> 00:03:46.524
The police are really out
for blood on this one.


8
00:03:46.548 --> 00:03:49.614
That's no surprise.

9
00:03:49.638 --> 00:03:53.183
I suggest you disappear
for the time being.


10
00:03:53.207 --> 00:03:57.535
I'm going off the radar myself.

11
00:03:57.559 --> 00:04:01.060
You won't be able to
reach me, so don't try.


12
00:04:01.084 --> 00:04:03.324
I'll reach out to you when
another assignment comes along


13
00:04:03.348 --> 00:04:07.371
that requires your
special skills.


14
00:04:07.395 --> 00:04:10.156
What are you now,
eight for eight?


15
00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.008
You deserve a break.

16
00:05:11.198 --> 00:05:14.177
Breakfast is ready!

17
00:05:14.201 --> 00:05:15.941
Be right there!

18
00:05:19.771 --> 00:05:21.880
Sweetie, what are you doing?

19
00:05:21.904 --> 00:05:23.186
Looking for a
blanket for Cheryl.


20
00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:24.491
She's cold.

21
00:05:24.515 --> 00:05:25.795
Well, your food is getting cold.

22
00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:26.950
Come on.

23
00:05:30.086 --> 00:05:31.237
Brrr!

24
00:05:31.261 --> 00:05:33.370
Ah!

25
00:05:33.394 --> 00:05:34.936
I caught a real doll.

26
00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.503
I didn't mean to
scare you, sweetie.


27
00:05:36.527 --> 00:05:38.247
But you've got to stay
out of my closet, ok?


28
00:05:38.271 --> 00:05:39.490
Alright.

29
00:05:46.146 --> 00:05:47.601
What's on the menu?

30
00:05:47.625 --> 00:05:49.690
Pancakes and toast.

31
00:05:49.714 --> 00:05:50.778
No can do.

32
00:05:50.802 --> 00:05:51.997
Diet, remember?

33
00:05:52.021 --> 00:05:54.695
What, are you training
for the Olympics?


34
00:05:54.719 --> 00:05:56.001
You look fantastic.

35
00:05:56.025 --> 00:05:58.656
Yeah, that's because
of the diet.


36
00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.441
I'll just have a piece of apple.

37
00:06:01.465 --> 00:06:03.095
It's going to be amazing.

38
00:06:03.119 --> 00:06:05.400
What do you say to your mother
first thing in the morning?


39
00:06:05.424 --> 00:06:07.578
I don't know, she's not here.

40
00:06:07.602 --> 00:06:09.057
Teri, we talked about this.

41
00:06:09.081 --> 00:06:11.451
Kurt.

42
00:06:11.475 --> 00:06:13.018
It's only been six months.

43
00:06:13.042 --> 00:06:13.801
These things take time.

44
00:06:13.825 --> 00:06:14.957
Don't rush it.

45
00:06:17.699 --> 00:06:19.259
What do you say to
Sarah in the morning?


46
00:06:19.283 --> 00:06:20.243
Good morning, Sarah.

47
00:06:20.267 --> 00:06:22.245
How's my favorite chipmunk?

48
00:06:22.269 --> 00:06:24.551
Ok, but Betty and
Cheryl are starving.


49
00:06:24.575 --> 00:06:26.423
Oh, that's not ok.

50
00:06:26.447 --> 00:06:28.642
Here, you know what?

51
00:06:28.666 --> 00:06:29.426
Feed them this.

52
00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:30.992
Thanks.

53
00:06:31.016 --> 00:06:31.819
You know what?

54
00:06:31.843 --> 00:06:33.062
You're better than mommy.

55
00:06:38.633 --> 00:06:39.808
Eskimo kiss?

56
00:06:42.985 --> 00:06:44.223
Can I get one of those?

57
00:06:44.247 --> 00:06:49.620
No. I've got something
better for you.


58
00:06:49.644 --> 00:06:51.244
Ok, early morning
meeting, I've gotta go.


59
00:06:51.268 --> 00:06:52.057
Not fair.

60
00:06:52.081 --> 00:06:53.058
Someone's gotta work.

61
00:06:53.082 --> 00:06:54.102
Hey, I work.

62
00:06:54.126 --> 00:06:55.756
I'm just lacking the paycheque.

63
00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:57.540
That will come as soon
as you sell the novel.


64
00:06:57.564 --> 00:06:58.497
Bye, little woman,
see you tonight.


65
00:06:58.521 --> 00:06:59.369
Bye.

66
00:06:59.393 --> 00:07:00.674
Bye, get some good writing done.

67
00:07:00.698 --> 00:07:01.719
Love you!

68
00:07:01.743 --> 00:07:02.720
Love you more!

69
00:07:02.744 --> 00:07:04.354
Not possible!

70
00:08:08.549 --> 00:08:14.531
There has been a significant
drop in business.


71
00:08:14.555 --> 00:08:16.794
Many of our clientele have
been pulling back funding


72
00:08:16.818 --> 00:08:20.580
for the advertising
of their products.


73
00:08:20.604 --> 00:08:24.367
And yet, our competitors,
like Dickson and Barryman,


74
00:08:24.391 --> 00:08:27.500
are seeing profits spike.

75
00:08:27.524 --> 00:08:29.178
Can any of you explain that?

76
00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:35.291
It comes down to trust.

77
00:08:35.315 --> 00:08:38.903
We are losing our client's trust
and we must win that back


78
00:08:38.927 --> 00:08:42.167
if we hope to stay afloat.

79
00:08:42.191 --> 00:08:45.126
We have to be better and
practise what we preach.


80
00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:47.955
Yes. Absolutely, Mr. Solomon.

81
00:08:47.979 --> 00:08:51.742
And this goes for everyone
at this advertising agency.


82
00:08:51.766 --> 00:08:53.570
I need role models.

83
00:08:53.594 --> 00:08:55.876
Go-getters.

84
00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:59.184
If you want to hold
onto your jobs,


85
00:08:59.208 --> 00:09:02.622
you have to deliver the goods.

86
00:09:02.646 --> 00:09:05.843
Is that clear?

87
00:09:05.867 --> 00:09:06.626
Yes.

88
00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:08.106
Uh, yes. Clear.

89
00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:12.980
Good, good.

90
00:09:13.004 --> 00:09:14.112
That's it.

91
00:09:14.136 --> 00:09:15.536
Time to start looking
for a new job.


92
00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:16.375
You worry too much.

93
00:09:16.399 --> 00:09:17.550
You don't worry enough.

94
00:09:17.574 --> 00:09:19.073
You're supporting a
husband and a kid.


95
00:09:19.097 --> 00:09:20.771
How are you going to do that
on an unemployment cheque?


96
00:09:20.795 --> 00:09:22.075
Failure is not an
option of mine.


97
00:09:22.099 --> 00:09:23.251
It might be one of yours.

98
00:09:23.275 --> 00:09:24.875
That's right, everything
always works out


99
00:09:24.899 --> 00:09:26.342
for the great Sarah Goodall.

100
00:09:26.366 --> 00:09:28.126
I mean Miller.

101
00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:29.170
You know, I still can't believe
that you got that promotion


102
00:09:29.194 --> 00:09:30.955
in less than a year.

103
00:09:30.979 --> 00:09:32.348
Are you jealous?

104
00:09:32.372 --> 00:09:35.002
No. I don't know the
definition of that word.


105
00:09:35.026 --> 00:09:36.306
Later Jackson, 
I got work to do!

106
00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:42.009
Good morning, Mrs. Miller.

107
00:09:42.033 --> 00:09:43.489
Is something wrong?

108
00:09:43.513 --> 00:09:45.230
Uh, no.

109
00:09:45.254 --> 00:09:48.039
I just thought I saw myself
sitting there for a minute.


110
00:09:50.651 --> 00:09:52.368
Oh. Just trying to
take your advice.


111
00:09:52.392 --> 00:09:54.272
You know, present the
public with the role model


112
00:09:54.296 --> 00:09:55.196
I most admire.

113
00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:57.242
And you choose me?

114
00:09:57.266 --> 00:09:58.417
I hope you don't mind.

115
00:09:58.441 --> 00:09:59.853
No, not at all.

116
00:09:59.877 --> 00:10:02.552
I've always wanted a mirror
of my brunette self.


117
00:10:02.576 --> 00:10:04.162
I look good.

118
00:10:04.186 --> 00:10:05.990
Thank you.

119
00:10:06.014 --> 00:10:08.340
I put a few items on
your desk for review,


120
00:10:08.364 --> 00:10:09.863
emailed over all
of your messages,


121
00:10:09.887 --> 00:10:12.300
and then I just finished
reorganizing that file cabinet.


122
00:10:12.324 --> 00:10:13.519
And how's the construction

123
00:10:13.543 --> 00:10:15.956
on my penthouse
apartment coming along?


124
00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:17.262
Um, I'm sorry.

125
00:10:17.286 --> 00:10:18.461
Construction?

126
00:10:19.723 --> 00:10:20.961
That was a joke.

127
00:10:20.985 --> 00:10:22.025
Seriously, you're amazing.

128
00:10:22.049 --> 00:10:23.007
Thank you, Julie.

129
00:10:23.031 --> 00:10:23.964
Now get back to work.

130
00:10:23.988 --> 00:10:25.575
Right away.

131
00:10:25.599 --> 00:10:26.793
Oh, I mean me.

132
00:10:26.817 --> 00:10:28.819
The Stoker account awaits.

133
00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:27.375
I wonder who that could be?

134
00:11:27.399 --> 00:11:29.421
Mrs. Punctual?

135
00:11:29.445 --> 00:11:32.424
I wonder who forgot to bring the
mail in again, Mr. Forgetful.


136
00:11:32.448 --> 00:11:34.488
Well, when your hands are
full of dolls and crayons,


137
00:11:34.512 --> 00:11:35.645
choices have to be made.

138
00:11:35.669 --> 00:11:37.192
I'm sorry.

139
00:11:38.193 --> 00:11:39.518
Alright.

140
00:11:39.542 --> 00:11:41.955
Oh... Teri, honey,
what have I told you


141
00:11:41.979 --> 00:11:43.261
about hiding in my closet?

142
00:11:43.285 --> 00:11:44.218
Shh.

143
00:11:44.242 --> 00:11:45.829
Betty and Cheryl are sleeping.

144
00:11:45.853 --> 00:11:47.573
Ok, then why don't you
take Betty and Cheryl


145
00:11:47.597 --> 00:11:49.049
up to your room?

146
00:11:49.073 --> 00:11:51.095
I think they'll be more
comfortable in your bed.


147
00:11:51.119 --> 00:11:52.575
You think?

148
00:11:52.599 --> 00:11:54.664
I know.

149
00:11:54.688 --> 00:11:56.124
Ok.

150
00:12:05.699 --> 00:12:07.328
Kurt, you gotta talk to her.

151
00:12:07.352 --> 00:12:09.417
I don't want to keep telling
her to stay out of my closet.


152
00:12:09.441 --> 00:12:10.331
These are my things, you know?

153
00:12:10.355 --> 00:12:11.768
It's a bit of a pet peeve.

154
00:12:11.792 --> 00:12:13.596
I get it.

155
00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:14.858
Thank you.

156
00:12:14.882 --> 00:12:16.274
Hi.

157
00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:20.690
How are you?

158
00:12:20.714 --> 00:12:22.300
Good.

159
00:12:22.324 --> 00:12:24.432
So how's novel writing going?

160
00:12:24.456 --> 00:12:26.304
It was going fine
until she called.


161
00:12:26.328 --> 00:12:27.827
Oh.

162
00:12:27.851 --> 00:12:29.771
Teri's mother, the nut
case with a dash of crazy.


163
00:12:29.795 --> 00:12:30.656
Victoria again?

164
00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:33.224
Does she not realize that
divorce means "move on, honey"?


165
00:12:33.248 --> 00:12:34.878
Not until she's dead and buried.

166
00:12:34.902 --> 00:12:36.575
That can be arranged.

167
00:12:36.599 --> 00:12:39.360
I mean, I know a guy.

168
00:12:39.384 --> 00:12:41.624
That's tempting.

169
00:12:41.648 --> 00:12:43.451
So she's still
trying for custody?


170
00:12:43.475 --> 00:12:44.409
Yeah.

171
00:12:44.433 --> 00:12:45.593
She was in a mental facility.

172
00:12:45.617 --> 00:12:46.629
The woman is unstable.

173
00:12:46.653 --> 00:12:47.934
The court can't grant her...

174
00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:49.598
She's out now and she's
doing much better,


175
00:12:49.622 --> 00:12:51.198
so she says,

176
00:12:51.222 --> 00:12:54.985
and after her father died
he left her everything.


177
00:12:55.009 --> 00:12:56.116
So now Victoria is
claiming that she could be


178
00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:57.030
a better childcare provider

179
00:12:57.054 --> 00:12:58.379
because of her new found wealth.

180
00:12:58.403 --> 00:13:00.643
It takes more than money
to raise a child.


181
00:13:00.667 --> 00:13:01.644
She needs love and nurturing.

182
00:13:01.668 --> 00:13:04.864
Victoria doesn't have a case.

183
00:13:04.888 --> 00:13:06.063
Yeah.

184
00:13:34.091 --> 00:13:35.547
Kurt?

185
00:13:35.571 --> 00:13:36.896
What is it, honey?

186
00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:40.944
I'm on a roll here and
I'd like to keep going.


187
00:13:40.968 --> 00:13:41.858
Is that ok?

188
00:13:41.882 --> 00:13:42.641
Yeah.

189
00:13:42.665 --> 00:13:43.381
Yeah, yeah.

190
00:13:43.405 --> 00:13:44.251
Go ahead.

191
00:13:44.275 --> 00:13:45.992
Thanks.

192
00:13:46.016 --> 00:13:46.645
I just don't want to lose my
train of thought, you know?


193
00:13:46.669 --> 00:13:47.888
No, no, of course.

194
00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:11.888
Kurt?

195
00:14:11.912 --> 00:14:13.846
What is it?

196
00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:15.742
There's a problem.

197
00:14:17.265 --> 00:14:19.939
There was no note, no address
or anything on the envelope,


198
00:14:19.963 --> 00:14:21.375
we have no idea who sent it

199
00:14:21.399 --> 00:14:23.943
so we thought it was best
we contact the police.


200
00:14:23.967 --> 00:14:25.553
You thought it was best.

201
00:14:25.577 --> 00:14:27.077
Ok, yes.

202
00:14:27.101 --> 00:14:30.602
I thought it was best that
we contact the police.


203
00:14:30.626 --> 00:14:34.998
And you say the photos on
your cell disappeared?


204
00:14:35.022 --> 00:14:38.044
Well, my wife accidentally
deletes things all the time.


205
00:14:38.068 --> 00:14:40.786
I didn't accidentally
delete anything.


206
00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:42.970
They were sent to me from
that new program, Flash Chat.


207
00:14:42.994 --> 00:14:44.660
They're sent to you

208
00:14:44.684 --> 00:14:47.575
and within seconds they
disappear, untraceable.


209
00:14:47.599 --> 00:14:50.274
And all the pictures were
of you outside the office,


210
00:14:50.298 --> 00:14:51.492
outside of this house?

211
00:14:51.516 --> 00:14:53.277
Yeah.

212
00:14:53.301 --> 00:14:55.888
Well, unfortunately there
is no law in this state


213
00:14:55.912 --> 00:14:58.325
against taking pictures
in a public place.


214
00:14:58.349 --> 00:15:02.199
They were all of
my wife, officer.


215
00:15:02.223 --> 00:15:03.722
Which I understand
is disturbing,


216
00:15:03.746 --> 00:15:08.248
but it's not illegal.

217
00:15:08.272 --> 00:15:10.686
Have you received any
letters or threats?


218
00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:12.731
No.

219
00:15:12.755 --> 00:15:14.951
Love letters?

220
00:15:14.975 --> 00:15:17.040
What the hell are you
implying, officer?


221
00:15:17.064 --> 00:15:19.259
My wife has not done
anything wrong.


222
00:15:19.283 --> 00:15:22.088
My mistake, I misspoke.

223
00:15:22.112 --> 00:15:24.656
But the truth be told,

224
00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:27.311
this leaves us with very
little to work with.


225
00:15:27.335 --> 00:15:29.052
I mean, no crime has
been committed,


226
00:15:29.076 --> 00:15:32.620
not even the threat of a crime.

227
00:15:32.644 --> 00:15:36.126
I'm sorry, but there's nothing
we can do at this point.


228
00:15:50.445 --> 00:15:52.336
Morning, Sarah.

229
00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:53.467
How's the family?

230
00:15:53.491 --> 00:15:55.731
Terry's great, Kurt's great.

231
00:15:55.755 --> 00:15:56.949
Oh, don't I know.

232
00:15:56.973 --> 00:15:58.559
He's a catch.

233
00:15:58.583 --> 00:16:00.518
Hooked a good one.

234
00:16:00.542 --> 00:16:03.826
Well, give him my best.

235
00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:05.286
See ya!

236
00:16:08.701 --> 00:16:09.701
Oh.

237
00:16:09.725 --> 00:16:11.398
Hey, it's just me.

238
00:16:11.422 --> 00:16:13.923
It's crossing guard day
at school, remember?


239
00:16:13.947 --> 00:16:14.793
Yeah.

240
00:16:14.817 --> 00:16:16.360
Don't mess with the law.

241
00:16:16.384 --> 00:16:18.144
I wouldn't dream of it.

242
00:16:18.168 --> 00:16:20.364
I try to avoid getting arrested.

243
00:16:20.388 --> 00:16:22.428
Why don't you let me give
you a ride to the station?


244
00:16:22.452 --> 00:16:23.236
No thanks, babe.

245
00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:24.934
I want to.

246
00:16:24.958 --> 00:16:28.328
I want to make sure those
admirers know that you're taken.


247
00:16:28.352 --> 00:16:31.767
Ah, speaking of admirers,
you just missed Louise.


248
00:16:31.791 --> 00:16:33.464
She gives you her best.

249
00:16:33.488 --> 00:16:36.728
Well, she wants to
give you her best.


250
00:16:36.752 --> 00:16:38.469
Louise and I are just neighbors.

251
00:16:38.493 --> 00:16:40.776
Yeah, well I think she
moves in circles.


252
00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:42.080
You said she was divorced twice,

253
00:16:42.104 --> 00:16:44.019
I think she's
coming back around.


254
00:16:45.761 --> 00:16:46.869
Teri, come on.

255
00:16:46.893 --> 00:16:48.459
We're taking Sarah
to the station.


256
00:17:29.457 --> 00:17:32.218
You're almost late.

257
00:17:32.242 --> 00:17:34.220
Almost late is the same
thing as saying "on time".


258
00:17:34.244 --> 00:17:35.526
I showed up a half hour early.

259
00:17:35.550 --> 00:17:37.833
I'm not taking any
chances this week.


260
00:17:37.857 --> 00:17:39.008
Jackson, I was wondering...

261
00:17:39.032 --> 00:17:42.011
did you have anything
to do with this?


262
00:17:42.035 --> 00:17:43.751
No, I only shoot nudes.

263
00:17:43.775 --> 00:17:44.840
I'm being serious.

264
00:17:44.864 --> 00:17:46.058
So am I.

265
00:17:46.082 --> 00:17:46.885
You want to set up for
a shoot sometime?


266
00:17:46.909 --> 00:17:47.973
That's never gonna happen.

267
00:17:47.997 --> 00:17:49.322
Can't blame a guy for trying.

268
00:17:49.346 --> 00:17:51.000
Yes, I can.

269
00:17:54.612 --> 00:17:55.720
Morning, Julie.

270
00:17:55.744 --> 00:17:56.634
Oh good, you're here.

271
00:17:56.658 --> 00:17:59.680
I've been trying to reach you.

272
00:17:59.704 --> 00:18:03.336
God, that is a great dress.

273
00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:05.121
Thanks.

274
00:18:05.145 --> 00:18:06.600
Yeah, I got a new cell,
new number, so...


275
00:18:06.624 --> 00:18:08.080
Oh, what happened
to your old one?


276
00:18:08.104 --> 00:18:09.865
I just thought it was time
for an upgrade, you know?


277
00:18:09.889 --> 00:18:11.475
Actually, can you put my
business contacts in there?


278
00:18:11.499 --> 00:18:12.998
I think you have more of a
complete list than I do.


279
00:18:13.022 --> 00:18:13.738
Sure, yeah.

280
00:18:13.762 --> 00:18:14.826
Easier done than said.

281
00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:16.262
Is your new number
listed in here?


282
00:18:16.286 --> 00:18:17.176
Yeah, it should be.

283
00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:18.308
Ok.

284
00:18:18.332 --> 00:18:19.744
Oh, and Mr. Solomon stopped by.

285
00:18:19.768 --> 00:18:22.965
He wants to talk to you
about the Stoker account.


286
00:18:22.989 --> 00:18:24.836
Tell him I will be
in in a minute.


287
00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:26.166
Ok.

288
00:18:59.155 --> 00:19:00.872
Sarah.

289
00:19:00.896 --> 00:19:01.655
Oh, Mr. Solomon, I was just
heading over to your office.


290
00:19:01.679 --> 00:19:03.377
Well, I saved you a trip.

291
00:19:04.813 --> 00:19:06.162
Your phone is all done.

292
00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:19.978
I don't have to tell you,
Sarah, but I'm going to anyway.


293
00:19:20.002 --> 00:19:22.763
A lot is riding
on this campaign.


294
00:19:22.787 --> 00:19:25.070
Stoker is a big account

295
00:19:25.094 --> 00:19:30.858
and possibly all our jobs are
on the line, including mine.


296
00:19:30.882 --> 00:19:33.644
And if the boss is worried
about losing his job,


297
00:19:33.668 --> 00:19:35.428
you know things are serious.

298
00:19:35.452 --> 00:19:38.040
I completely understand, Mr.
Solomon.


299
00:19:38.064 --> 00:19:41.782
There's no need to worry, I
have everything under control.


300
00:19:41.806 --> 00:19:44.002
You know there's a
$200,000 cash bonus


301
00:19:44.026 --> 00:19:46.289
for whoever pulls
off this campaign?


302
00:19:49.989 --> 00:19:54.056
I did not know that.

303
00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:56.691
Is that what you were discussing
with Jackson in the hall?


304
00:19:58.910 --> 00:20:02.151
That's strange.

305
00:20:02.175 --> 00:20:03.891
Your phone doesn't
usually ring like that?


306
00:20:03.915 --> 00:20:06.459
It's not that, I
just got this cell.


307
00:20:06.483 --> 00:20:07.919
No one has the number.

308
00:20:12.533 --> 00:20:14.424
Something important?

309
00:20:14.448 --> 00:20:17.296
No, it's nothing.

310
00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:21.997
So, you know how important
the stoker account is now


311
00:20:22.021 --> 00:20:25.478
and we need to pull this
off with flying colors.


312
00:20:25.502 --> 00:20:26.914
Understood.

313
00:20:26.938 --> 00:20:29.004
No distractions, giving
your full attention


314
00:20:29.028 --> 00:20:31.136
to every last detail.

315
00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:33.182
And if this one works...

316
00:20:33.206 --> 00:20:35.532
Sarah?

317
00:20:35.556 --> 00:20:37.186
Are you listening to me?

318
00:20:37.210 --> 00:20:38.839
Yes. Yes.

319
00:20:38.863 --> 00:20:40.983
Rest assured the Stoker account
has my full attention.


320
00:20:41.007 --> 00:20:41.886
Absolutely.

321
00:20:41.910 --> 00:20:43.583
Is the sun here in your eyes?

322
00:20:43.607 --> 00:20:45.411
I just feel like it's
a bit distracting.


323
00:20:45.435 --> 00:20:49.048
I'm fine, Sarah. Are you ok?

324
00:20:52.921 --> 00:20:54.072
Yes, I'm fine.

325
00:20:54.096 --> 00:20:55.532
Never better.

326
00:20:59.406 --> 00:21:01.558
I'll leave you to it then.

327
00:21:01.582 --> 00:21:05.388
Just give me greatness,
that's all I ask for.


328
00:21:05.412 --> 00:21:06.891
Will do.

329
00:21:19.687 --> 00:21:20.881
No.

330
00:21:20.905 --> 00:21:21.752
Did you give my
number to anyone?


331
00:21:21.776 --> 00:21:22.361
Yes.

332
00:21:22.385 --> 00:21:24.059
What?

333
00:21:24.083 --> 00:21:25.538
Well, your husband called just as Mr.
Solomon came in


334
00:21:25.562 --> 00:21:27.410
and I didn't want to
disrupt your meeting.


335
00:21:27.434 --> 00:21:28.933
And then he mentioned that
he couldn't reach you


336
00:21:28.957 --> 00:21:30.587
on your cell and I realized
he didn't have the new number


337
00:21:30.611 --> 00:21:31.718
so I gave it to him.

338
00:21:31.742 --> 00:21:32.980
I hope that's ok.

339
00:21:33.004 --> 00:21:33.894
Yeah, no that's fine.

340
00:21:33.918 --> 00:21:34.765
Just nobody else.

341
00:21:34.789 --> 00:21:37.420
Ok.

342
00:21:37.444 --> 00:21:39.813
What is that?

343
00:21:39.837 --> 00:21:41.361
Uh, my lipstick?

344
00:21:43.189 --> 00:21:44.688
Is that Red Passion by Louelle?

345
00:21:44.712 --> 00:21:46.559
It is.

346
00:21:46.583 --> 00:21:47.995
Do you like it?

347
00:21:48.019 --> 00:21:52.435
Yeah, no I use it on my
date nights with Kurt.


348
00:21:52.459 --> 00:21:54.741
Lucky guess, I guess.

349
00:21:54.765 --> 00:21:56.830
So do you um...

350
00:21:56.854 --> 00:21:58.441
do you talk to Kurt a lot?

351
00:21:58.465 --> 00:22:00.878
No, not that often.

352
00:22:00.902 --> 00:22:05.709
But every time that I
do, he is so nice.


353
00:22:05.733 --> 00:22:08.233
You're so lucky.

354
00:22:08.257 --> 00:22:12.759
Yes, he's very nice.

355
00:22:12.783 --> 00:22:14.742
What are you doing for lunch?

356
00:22:18.224 --> 00:22:20.376
I've been working for you
for over five months now


357
00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:24.293
and this is the first time that
you've asked me for lunch.


358
00:22:24.317 --> 00:22:25.877
I've heard the rumors
like everyone else


359
00:22:25.901 --> 00:22:27.209
about possible layoffs coming...

360
00:22:27.233 --> 00:22:30.212
No, no, no. It's
nothing like that.


361
00:22:30.236 --> 00:22:31.909
It's nothing like that.

362
00:22:31.933 --> 00:22:34.253
I just wanted to see what's
going on from your perspective,


363
00:22:34.277 --> 00:22:35.869
you know?

364
00:22:35.893 --> 00:22:38.045
I mean, between you and me
you're the eyes and ears


365
00:22:38.069 --> 00:22:40.091
of the office, so...

366
00:22:40.115 --> 00:22:41.484
Thank you, Mrs. Miller.

367
00:22:41.508 --> 00:22:43.877
I didn't know you
considered me your...


368
00:22:43.901 --> 00:22:46.315
I didn't know you considered me.

369
00:22:46.339 --> 00:22:49.318
Come on, Julie, you
have all my numbers,


370
00:22:49.342 --> 00:22:52.495
you pick up my morning
mail and my messages.


371
00:22:52.519 --> 00:22:56.716
I mean, what would I do
without you, really?


372
00:22:56.740 --> 00:23:02.505
Actually, have you received any
unusual phone calls or emails,


373
00:23:02.529 --> 00:23:04.376
anything I should be aware of?

374
00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:05.682
No.

375
00:23:05.706 --> 00:23:07.316
No, not that I can think of.

376
00:23:15.542 --> 00:23:17.370
Do you know what this is?

377
00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:23.090
It looks like you
coming into work.


378
00:23:23.114 --> 00:23:24.135
Who took this?

379
00:23:24.159 --> 00:23:27.312
That's what I was wondering.

380
00:23:27.336 --> 00:23:29.836
Is someone watching you?

381
00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:32.665
Like a secret admirer?

382
00:23:32.689 --> 00:23:34.406
You have the secret
part correct,


383
00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:38.715
I don't know about
the admirer part.


384
00:23:38.739 --> 00:23:41.283
Have you talked to Jackson?

385
00:23:41.307 --> 00:23:43.241
Why would you ask that?

386
00:23:43.265 --> 00:23:46.375
Well, I know he's
interested in you.


387
00:23:46.399 --> 00:23:48.028
What?

388
00:23:48.052 --> 00:23:51.118
He comes by my desk and asks
about you all the time.


389
00:23:51.142 --> 00:23:52.772
What do you tell him?

390
00:23:52.796 --> 00:23:55.253
That you are happily married
and that you love your husband


391
00:23:55.277 --> 00:23:58.169
very, very much.

392
00:23:58.193 --> 00:24:00.650
Honestly, Mrs. Miller,
I wish I was so lucky.


393
00:24:00.674 --> 00:24:05.307
Oh, don't worry Julie, I'm
sure you will be one day too.


394
00:24:05.331 --> 00:24:07.898
Well, here's hoping.

395
00:24:11.859 --> 00:24:13.489
Shoot, it's getting late.

396
00:24:13.513 --> 00:24:14.968
I have a little errand to run
before I go back to the office,


397
00:24:14.992 --> 00:24:16.187
is that ok?

398
00:24:16.211 --> 00:24:17.449
Yeah, of course. What is it?

399
00:24:17.473 --> 00:24:18.929
I have to go to Block,

400
00:24:18.953 --> 00:24:20.887
grab a dress for a friend's
wedding next weekend.


401
00:24:20.911 --> 00:24:21.975
Why don't I come with you?

402
00:24:21.999 --> 00:24:23.803
I could use a new outfit myself.

403
00:24:23.827 --> 00:24:26.221
Oh, ok.

404
00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:29.331
Thanks!

405
00:24:29.355 --> 00:24:30.747
Take care.

406
00:24:39.690 --> 00:24:40.690
Hey, kiddo.

407
00:24:40.714 --> 00:24:41.865
Where do you wanna go?

408
00:24:41.889 --> 00:24:42.866
Home.

409
00:24:42.890 --> 00:24:44.259
Aren't you hungry?

410
00:24:44.283 --> 00:24:46.565
Betty and Cheryl will miss me.

411
00:24:46.589 --> 00:24:47.784
Ok, well we could
go by the house,


412
00:24:47.808 --> 00:24:48.741
pick up Betty and Cheryl

413
00:24:48.765 --> 00:24:50.090
and all four of us could go eat?

414
00:24:50.114 --> 00:24:50.830
Ok.

415
00:24:50.854 --> 00:24:51.986
Ok.

416
00:25:10.874 --> 00:25:12.006
Can you help me?

417
00:25:16.445 --> 00:25:20.773
Oh, I never realized
we're the same size.


418
00:25:20.797 --> 00:25:23.428
We could wear each
others clothes.


419
00:25:23.452 --> 00:25:24.908
How does it look?

420
00:25:24.932 --> 00:25:27.389
It's lovely.

421
00:25:27.413 --> 00:25:29.533
I'm going to have to borrow
this for a date with Kurt.


422
00:25:29.557 --> 00:25:32.045
Do you think he'd like it?

423
00:25:32.069 --> 00:25:33.244
Oh, hold on.

424
00:25:42.210 --> 00:25:43.733
Is something the matter?

425
00:26:37.526 --> 00:26:39.025
Sarah.

426
00:26:39.049 --> 00:26:40.113
You know what?

427
00:26:40.137 --> 00:26:41.617
I'm going to be right there, ok?

428
00:26:43.837 --> 00:26:45.684
Two hours.

429
00:26:45.708 --> 00:26:48.165
Long lunch.

430
00:26:48.189 --> 00:26:50.776
Flirting with the danger zone.

431
00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:52.430
You know, because I'm just
worried about getting laid off.


432
00:26:52.454 --> 00:26:53.736
Solomon's on the warpath.

433
00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:57.087
He's just looking for
reasons to fire people,


434
00:26:57.111 --> 00:27:00.288
and I'd just be careful
with these long lunches.


435
00:27:01.701 --> 00:27:02.701
What are friends for?

436
00:27:02.725 --> 00:27:04.486
We've got to stick together.

437
00:27:04.510 --> 00:27:08.228
Look out for one another.

438
00:27:08.252 --> 00:27:09.950
Exactly.

439
00:27:11.168 --> 00:27:12.779
Catch you later.

440
00:27:18.654 --> 00:27:22.242
Hey, are you ok?

441
00:27:22.266 --> 00:27:24.419
Are you still freaked by
seeing that guy get hit?


442
00:27:24.443 --> 00:27:26.116
Yeah, no, no, I'm fine.
I'm fine.


443
00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:27.700
Can you just get my
husband on the line?


444
00:27:27.724 --> 00:27:29.160
Put him through to my office.

445
00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:39.020
Mrs. Miller, your husband
isn't answering his cell.


446
00:27:39.044 --> 00:27:41.914
Do you want me to try
your home number?


447
00:27:41.938 --> 00:27:43.002
No thanks, Julie.

448
00:27:43.026 --> 00:27:44.463
I can manage.

449
00:28:31.205 --> 00:28:32.859
It wasn't him.

450
00:28:53.749 --> 00:28:56.989
The Miller's aren't home,
please leave a message.


451
00:28:57.013 --> 00:28:58.643
Kurt, hey, it's me.

452
00:28:58.667 --> 00:29:01.254
Something happened
today, something...


453
00:29:01.278 --> 00:29:02.255
I'll tell you about it later.

454
00:29:02.279 --> 00:29:04.257
I'm coming in on the 5:06.

455
00:29:04.281 --> 00:29:09.959
Since you drove me I'm gonna
need a ride home if that's ok.


456
00:29:09.983 --> 00:29:11.743
I love you.

457
00:29:11.767 --> 00:29:13.508
Ok, bye.

458
00:29:25.584 --> 00:29:26.584
Where's Teri?

459
00:29:26.608 --> 00:29:28.020
She's at home.

460
00:29:28.044 --> 00:29:29.544
She was watching
her favorite show


461
00:29:29.568 --> 00:29:32.634
so I had Louise come watch
her while I came to get you.


462
00:29:32.658 --> 00:29:34.026
Oh. That was so nice of Louise.

463
00:29:34.050 --> 00:29:35.550
It was.

464
00:29:35.574 --> 00:29:36.420
I got your message.

465
00:29:36.444 --> 00:29:39.597
What happened?

466
00:29:39.621 --> 00:29:41.741
I thought I saw the guy who
was taking pictures of me.


467
00:29:41.765 --> 00:29:42.426
You saw him?

468
00:29:42.450 --> 00:29:44.036
No, I didn't see him.

469
00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:45.951
It wasn't him.

470
00:29:45.975 --> 00:29:48.499
I still don't know who's behind
this or what he or she wants.


471
00:30:11.634 --> 00:30:12.674
Did you remember the mail?

472
00:30:12.698 --> 00:30:13.892
Yes. Just bills.

473
00:30:13.916 --> 00:30:16.005
No more manilla envelopes.

474
00:30:20.096 --> 00:30:22.292
Oh, welcome home love birds.

475
00:30:22.316 --> 00:30:23.249
Hi, Louise.

476
00:30:23.273 --> 00:30:23.989
Thank you for watching her.

477
00:30:24.013 --> 00:30:24.903
No problem.

478
00:30:24.927 --> 00:30:27.166
Teri is an angel.

479
00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:30.324
If I ever have kids I'd want
them to be just like yours.


480
00:30:33.675 --> 00:30:35.435
Would you like to
stay for dinner?


481
00:30:35.459 --> 00:30:38.656
No thank you, maybe
some other time.


482
00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:40.266
I did check on the
roast, though.


483
00:30:40.290 --> 00:30:44.227
It smells wonderful.

484
00:30:44.251 --> 00:30:45.968
Well, I'm off.

485
00:30:45.992 --> 00:30:48.927
Thanks again.

486
00:30:48.951 --> 00:30:50.083
Bye.

487
00:30:53.695 --> 00:30:54.815
I know what you're thinking.

488
00:30:54.839 --> 00:30:56.369
Don't say it.

489
00:30:56.393 --> 00:30:58.110
Then don't think it.

490
00:30:58.134 --> 00:31:00.112
My thoughts are pure.

491
00:31:00.136 --> 00:31:01.679
I can change that.

492
00:31:01.703 --> 00:31:02.835
Yeah.

493
00:31:12.105 --> 00:31:13.778
Did you change the photos?

494
00:31:13.802 --> 00:31:15.195
What?

495
00:31:17.501 --> 00:31:20.176
The photos, they're not
in the right order.


496
00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:22.091
This one was here,
that one was there.


497
00:31:22.115 --> 00:31:22.961
Are you sure?

498
00:31:22.985 --> 00:31:23.658
I'm positive.

499
00:31:23.682 --> 00:31:24.746
Did Louise do this?

500
00:31:24.770 --> 00:31:27.662
Why would Louise...

501
00:31:27.686 --> 00:31:29.383
Someone's been in the house.

502
00:31:37.521 --> 00:31:39.369
Honey, I think you're
being a little paranoid.


503
00:31:39.393 --> 00:31:40.413
I've been home for
hours with Teri,


504
00:31:40.437 --> 00:31:41.717
I didn't notice
anything missing.


505
00:31:41.741 --> 00:31:42.938
Kurt, someone's been here.

506
00:31:42.962 --> 00:31:44.922
Who would break into our
home to rearrange photos?


507
00:31:44.946 --> 00:31:46.332
Whoever has been stalking me!

508
00:31:46.356 --> 00:31:48.378
I got more photos on
my new phone today.


509
00:31:48.402 --> 00:31:49.422
Let me see them.

510
00:31:49.446 --> 00:31:52.077
They're gone, same as before!

511
00:31:52.101 --> 00:31:54.950
No note, no threat,
nothing illegal.


512
00:31:54.974 --> 00:31:57.517
The police can't do anything.

513
00:31:57.541 --> 00:31:58.910
Well, maybe they can.

514
00:31:58.934 --> 00:32:01.304
It wouldn't hurt to call.

515
00:32:01.328 --> 00:32:04.742
Daddy, when are we going to eat?

516
00:32:04.766 --> 00:32:06.135
Let's eat.

517
00:32:06.159 --> 00:32:08.180
We don't want Teri
worried about this.


518
00:32:08.204 --> 00:32:09.312
Ok.

519
00:32:09.336 --> 00:32:11.207
We'll figure it
out after dinner.


520
00:32:13.906 --> 00:32:16.517
It'll be ready soon, sweetie.

521
00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:40.647
So I was about to go
up to the black board


522
00:32:40.671 --> 00:32:44.826
when the big stupid kid, Elmer,
who thinks apples are green...


523
00:32:44.850 --> 00:32:48.046
Some apples are green.

524
00:32:48.070 --> 00:32:49.787
It's not nice to
call people stupid.


525
00:32:49.811 --> 00:32:51.833
He says I have big ears.

526
00:32:51.857 --> 00:32:53.697
Well, that's not nice
either because you don't.


527
00:32:53.721 --> 00:32:55.053
You have beautiful ears.

528
00:32:55.077 --> 00:32:57.229
So Elmer went up
to the black board


529
00:32:57.253 --> 00:33:01.320
and he didn't know the
answer 'cause he's so smart


530
00:33:01.344 --> 00:33:04.193
so I lifted my hand up to answer

531
00:33:04.217 --> 00:33:06.891
and then he leans
against the bookshelf


532
00:33:06.915 --> 00:33:10.982
and the whole thing breaks.

533
00:33:11.006 --> 00:33:14.725
So Elmer falls down and all
the books fall on top of him.


534
00:33:14.749 --> 00:33:15.857
Everyone was laughing.

535
00:33:15.881 --> 00:33:17.380
It was so funny.

536
00:33:17.404 --> 00:33:18.685
It doesn't sound very funny.

537
00:33:18.709 --> 00:33:20.015
It was.

538
00:33:20.929 --> 00:33:22.385
Teri, stop kicking the table

539
00:33:22.409 --> 00:33:23.952
and think about
this for a second.


540
00:33:23.976 --> 00:33:25.536
If you were the one
that broke the shelf


541
00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:27.869
and it fell down on you, would
you think it was funny?


542
00:33:27.893 --> 00:33:29.479
Maybe.

543
00:33:29.503 --> 00:33:31.916
My point is you don't
want to be laughed at,


544
00:33:31.940 --> 00:33:34.508
so do you think it's fair to
laugh at other people as well?


545
00:33:38.817 --> 00:33:40.098
Hey. What did I just say?

546
00:33:40.122 --> 00:33:41.796
It wasn't me, it was Betty.

547
00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:43.100
I'm not going to warn you again.

548
00:33:43.909 --> 00:33:45.451
Teri.

549
00:33:45.475 --> 00:33:47.410
It was Cheryl.

550
00:33:47.434 --> 00:33:49.542
Hey. Ok, that's enough.

551
00:33:49.566 --> 00:33:50.892
Daddy, Cheryl, stop it.

552
00:33:50.916 --> 00:33:51.893
Both of you, stop it.

553
00:33:51.917 --> 00:33:53.353
Right now.

554
00:34:06.714 --> 00:34:07.976
Um...

555
00:34:19.379 --> 00:34:21.923
I've had it for a while.

556
00:34:21.947 --> 00:34:25.578
Before we met I was mugged

557
00:34:25.602 --> 00:34:27.162
and it was the scariest
night of my life


558
00:34:27.186 --> 00:34:29.191
and I swore it was never
going to happen again.


559
00:34:29.215 --> 00:34:32.629
So I started working out,
taking self-defense courses


560
00:34:32.653 --> 00:34:35.458
and I got a gun.

561
00:34:35.482 --> 00:34:37.701
It's licensed, registered,
I know how to use it.


562
00:34:41.967 --> 00:34:45.076
You know I told you before...

563
00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:46.730
I don't like guns, Sarah.

564
00:34:46.754 --> 00:34:50.429
I know, that's why I
didn't tell you about it.


565
00:34:50.453 --> 00:34:52.301
But I'm a pretty good shot.

566
00:34:52.325 --> 00:34:56.348
Yeah, I remember because we
threw darts on our first date.


567
00:34:56.372 --> 00:34:58.292
Don't you think you're
overreacting a little bit?


568
00:35:06.992 --> 00:35:08.839
When did you get this?

569
00:35:08.863 --> 00:35:10.841
Just before when
we were up here.


570
00:35:10.865 --> 00:35:12.465
Ok, we have to report
this to the police.


571
00:35:12.489 --> 00:35:13.191
This is a threat.

572
00:35:13.215 --> 00:35:14.801
Is it?

573
00:35:14.825 --> 00:35:16.978
Not really.

574
00:35:17.002 --> 00:35:19.632
"It's not the final outcome, but
the waiting that gets to you"?


575
00:35:19.656 --> 00:35:21.721
That could mean anything.

576
00:35:21.745 --> 00:35:23.767
You know how that police
officer treated us today.


577
00:35:23.791 --> 00:35:26.378
I know, but this person
has been in our house.


578
00:35:26.402 --> 00:35:27.205
What about Teri?

579
00:35:27.229 --> 00:35:28.728
What if she's hurt?

580
00:35:28.752 --> 00:35:29.816
Maybe we should send her
to your parent's house.


581
00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:30.817
In Chicago?

582
00:35:30.841 --> 00:35:34.691
This guy destroy our family.

583
00:35:34.715 --> 00:35:37.259
Maybe we can all
take a vacation.


584
00:35:37.283 --> 00:35:39.391
Running away never
solves anything.


585
00:35:39.415 --> 00:35:42.090
Besides, if I leave now I
can kiss my job goodbye.


586
00:35:42.114 --> 00:35:43.874
They're doing cut-backs at work
and looking for any reason


587
00:35:43.898 --> 00:35:46.224
to lay people off and we
can't afford that right now.


588
00:35:46.248 --> 00:35:48.400
Not with your ex-wife
breathing down your neck.


589
00:35:48.424 --> 00:35:49.904
We should change the
locks to be safe.


590
00:35:49.928 --> 00:35:51.210
We have to stick together, Kurt.

591
00:35:51.234 --> 00:35:53.144
I'll keep an eye on Julie
and Jackson at work.


592
00:35:53.168 --> 00:35:54.276
Your secretary, Julie?

593
00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:55.494
She worships you, though.

594
00:35:55.518 --> 00:35:57.888
Yeah, maybe a little too much.

595
00:35:57.912 --> 00:36:00.193
And Jackson would do anything
to keep his job at the firm.


596
00:36:00.217 --> 00:36:03.154
I mean, if I'm let go, he's
in a stronger position.


597
00:36:03.178 --> 00:36:06.331
And we can't forget your lover
Louise across the street.


598
00:36:06.355 --> 00:36:07.550
Louise isn't going to be a...

599
00:36:07.574 --> 00:36:09.421
Kurt, give me a break.

600
00:36:09.445 --> 00:36:12.468
She's in love with
you, it's obvious.


601
00:36:12.492 --> 00:36:15.843
She was the one who was
here, she had access.


602
00:36:19.368 --> 00:36:21.408
I'm sorry, I really don't
know why this is happening


603
00:36:21.432 --> 00:36:23.783
but I'm gonna find out.

604
00:36:23.807 --> 00:36:26.873
No, we'll find out.

605
00:36:26.897 --> 00:36:28.725
Together.

606
00:36:29.988 --> 00:36:32.096
I love you, Sarah.

607
00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:33.861
I love you, too.

608
00:36:35.645 --> 00:36:37.972
Ctures can't hurt us, right?

609
00:36:37.996 --> 00:36:40.520
Pictures can't hurt us.

610
00:37:09.114 --> 00:37:10.463
That's yesterday.

611
00:37:16.338 --> 00:37:17.905
Who are you?!!

612
00:37:32.180 --> 00:37:33.375
Hey Teri, come on.

613
00:37:33.399 --> 00:37:35.333
Time for school.

614
00:37:35.357 --> 00:37:37.272
Coming!

615
00:37:44.714 --> 00:37:46.127
Hey, George!

616
00:37:46.151 --> 00:37:47.737
What gives?

617
00:37:47.761 --> 00:37:50.131
I'm sorry, can I help you?

618
00:37:50.155 --> 00:37:52.035
I thought you were George,
our regular mail man.


619
00:37:52.059 --> 00:37:54.178
Oh, no, I'm filling
in for him this week.


620
00:37:54.202 --> 00:37:55.179
I'm Harold.

621
00:37:55.203 --> 00:37:56.485
What happened to George?

622
00:37:56.509 --> 00:37:58.487
Uh, some sort of
family thing I heard.


623
00:37:58.511 --> 00:37:59.749
Emergency.

624
00:37:59.773 --> 00:38:01.035
I don't know much about it.

625
00:38:03.124 --> 00:38:04.754
Hey Teri, wait in the car.

626
00:38:04.778 --> 00:38:06.799
I'll be right there.

627
00:38:06.823 --> 00:38:08.410
Cute kid.

628
00:38:08.434 --> 00:38:09.889
Yeah, yeah she is.

629
00:38:09.913 --> 00:38:10.760
Mr...

630
00:38:10.784 --> 00:38:11.456
Martin.

631
00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:12.283
Harold Martin.

632
00:38:12.307 --> 00:38:14.111
You can call me Harold,

633
00:38:14.135 --> 00:38:16.592
that's what I'm telling all the
folks up and down the block.


634
00:38:16.616 --> 00:38:19.421
You got a real friendly
neighborhood here, Mr. Miller.


635
00:38:19.445 --> 00:38:21.771
It makes me happy
that I transferred.


636
00:38:21.795 --> 00:38:23.077
Dad, let's go!

637
00:38:23.101 --> 00:38:24.821
Oh, listen to me, I'm
standing here babbling


638
00:38:24.845 --> 00:38:26.405
and you're in a hurry
to get some place.


639
00:38:26.429 --> 00:38:27.864
I'll leave you to it.

640
00:38:27.888 --> 00:38:29.648
Thanks, Harold.

641
00:38:29.672 --> 00:38:32.303
Oh, by the way, George

642
00:38:32.327 --> 00:38:34.523
usually leaves the mail in the uh...
mailbox.


643
00:38:34.547 --> 00:38:35.827
Yeah, that was my intention too,

644
00:38:35.851 --> 00:38:37.265
but you've got no room in there.

645
00:38:37.289 --> 00:38:38.744
You've got a package
or something.


646
00:38:38.768 --> 00:38:41.138
It was there when I arrived.

647
00:38:41.162 --> 00:38:43.469
It's really nice to meet you, Mr.
Miller.


648
00:39:10.191 --> 00:39:11.271
Teri! Put on your seatbelt!

649
00:39:11.295 --> 00:39:13.170
What's wrong?

650
00:39:13.194 --> 00:39:14.674
Nothing, just do
what I told you!


651
00:39:20.897 --> 00:39:22.334
We're not that late.

652
00:39:32.387 --> 00:39:34.476
911, what's your emergency?

653
00:39:47.707 --> 00:39:49.511
I'm just saying that
I think Sarah's been


654
00:39:49.535 --> 00:39:52.929
a little out of sorts
the last few days.


655
00:39:54.888 --> 00:39:56.126
Morning.

656
00:39:56.150 --> 00:39:57.258
Julie, do you have
any messages for me?


657
00:39:57.282 --> 00:39:58.824
Yes. Your husband
has been calling.


658
00:39:58.848 --> 00:40:00.522
He sounds really upset.

659
00:40:00.546 --> 00:40:02.266
He said that you're not
answering your cell?


660
00:40:02.290 --> 00:40:03.264
Yeah, I lost it.

661
00:40:03.288 --> 00:40:04.047
Can you get me a
new one, please?


662
00:40:04.071 --> 00:40:05.353
Ok, yep.

663
00:40:05.377 --> 00:40:07.050
He wants you to call
him back right away.


664
00:40:07.074 --> 00:40:09.394
And Mr. Solomon stopped by, he
wants to see you and Jackson


665
00:40:09.418 --> 00:40:12.577
at 10:30 this morning to
discuss the Stoker account.


666
00:40:12.601 --> 00:40:15.145
I've been recruited
too, it's mandatory.


667
00:40:15.169 --> 00:40:18.322
He's expecting results, it's
getting down to the wire.


668
00:40:18.346 --> 00:40:21.064
So, how's it going?

669
00:40:21.088 --> 00:40:22.718
It's going.

670
00:40:22.742 --> 00:40:24.198
And so am I.

671
00:40:24.222 --> 00:40:24.850
Work to do.

672
00:40:24.874 --> 00:40:27.462
Talk soon.

673
00:40:27.486 --> 00:40:29.028
Talk soon.

674
00:40:29.052 --> 00:40:30.793
Yeah.

675
00:40:32.055 --> 00:40:35.731
Mrs. Miller, you have
a call on line one.


676
00:40:35.755 --> 00:40:37.080
Is it my husband again?

677
00:40:37.104 --> 00:40:38.473
Lieutenant James Stern

678
00:40:38.497 --> 00:40:40.716
of the 28th division
police department.


679
00:40:50.639 --> 00:40:52.226
Hello?

680
00:40:52.250 --> 00:40:53.575
Good morning, Mrs. Miller.

681
00:40:53.599 --> 00:40:55.403
My name is Lieutenant
James Stern.


682
00:40:55.427 --> 00:40:58.971
I was wondering if I may
ask you some questions.


683
00:40:58.995 --> 00:41:00.799
Concerning...?

684
00:41:00.823 --> 00:41:04.412
The photographs, text messages,
notes you've been receiving


685
00:41:04.436 --> 00:41:06.588
the last few days.

686
00:41:06.612 --> 00:41:09.895
I received a call this
morning about your case.


687
00:41:09.919 --> 00:41:13.638
Um, well I really appreciate
your concern Lieutenant,


688
00:41:13.662 --> 00:41:17.512
but I'm sure it's just someone
playing a game with me.


689
00:41:17.536 --> 00:41:20.428
I wouldn't take things like
this so lightly, Mrs. Miller.


690
00:41:20.452 --> 00:41:23.692
There are a lot of sick
individuals out there.


691
00:41:23.716 --> 00:41:25.563
Well, we'll be alright.

692
00:41:25.587 --> 00:41:27.391
You see, I lost my cell phone,

693
00:41:27.415 --> 00:41:29.088
that's why my husband
couldn't reach me.


694
00:41:29.112 --> 00:41:30.786
He really shouldn't
have bothered you but


695
00:41:30.810 --> 00:41:33.136
with the kid, you know, he's
a little overprotective.


696
00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:34.640
It wasn't your
husband who called.


697
00:41:37.382 --> 00:41:40.839
Um... it wasn't?

698
00:41:40.863 --> 00:41:43.015
Who was it that contacted
your precinct?


699
00:41:43.039 --> 00:41:44.408
An anonymous caller.

700
00:41:44.432 --> 00:41:49.761
A concerned friend I
believe they said.


701
00:41:49.785 --> 00:41:51.197
Thank you, Lieutenant.

702
00:41:51.221 --> 00:41:52.503
Don't worry, Mrs. Miller.

703
00:41:52.527 --> 00:41:53.983
We'll be keeping an eye on you.

704
00:41:54.007 --> 00:41:55.027
No, no, no.

705
00:41:55.051 --> 00:41:56.420
That's really not necessary.

706
00:41:56.444 --> 00:41:57.247
It's part of the job.

707
00:41:57.271 --> 00:41:58.968
Good bye.

708
00:42:16.290 --> 00:42:17.528
Sarah Miller's desk.

709
00:42:17.552 --> 00:42:18.312
Oh, hi Mr. Miller.

710
00:42:18.336 --> 00:42:19.641
Mrs. Miller, I have...

711
00:42:21.643 --> 00:42:22.775
Can she call you back?

712
00:42:28.018 --> 00:42:29.018
Look, I gotta go.

713
00:42:29.042 --> 00:42:31.716
Ok. Talk to you later.

714
00:42:31.740 --> 00:42:33.152
What's up?

715
00:42:33.176 --> 00:42:34.415
Who you talking to?

716
00:42:34.439 --> 00:42:37.635
Oh, that was Andrew
in accounting


717
00:42:37.659 --> 00:42:40.159
to send over some numbers
for the Stoker account.


718
00:42:40.183 --> 00:42:40.943
You wanna take a look?

719
00:42:40.967 --> 00:42:42.118
What if for some reason

720
00:42:42.142 --> 00:42:44.250
I wasn't able to
finish the Stoker job?


721
00:42:44.274 --> 00:42:47.036
Who do you think Solomon
would put on the account?


722
00:42:47.060 --> 00:42:47.993
It's you, isn't it?

723
00:42:48.017 --> 00:42:50.431
Um, I don't know.

724
00:42:50.455 --> 00:42:52.375
I don't know, I've never
really thought about it.


725
00:42:52.399 --> 00:42:54.260
Of course you haven't.

726
00:42:54.284 --> 00:42:55.827
Ok, cut the crap Jackson.

727
00:42:55.851 --> 00:42:57.971
We both know you're scared
to death of losing your job


728
00:42:57.995 --> 00:43:00.832
and I'm secure because I'm
on the Stoker account.


729
00:43:00.856 --> 00:43:03.357
What are you trying
to say, Sarah?


730
00:43:03.381 --> 00:43:05.359
You've been getting pretty
friendly with Julie.


731
00:43:05.383 --> 00:43:08.144
Hanging around her desk,
looking over her shoulder


732
00:43:08.168 --> 00:43:10.015
at my schedule and
cell phone numbers.


733
00:43:10.039 --> 00:43:11.452
What? No. No.

734
00:43:11.476 --> 00:43:14.455
I mean, yes, I mean Julie,
she's a smoke show.


735
00:43:14.479 --> 00:43:17.458
Oh my god. You know what?

736
00:43:17.482 --> 00:43:19.068
Do not change the subject.

737
00:43:19.092 --> 00:43:20.765
You're the one who's been taking
pictures of me, admit it.


738
00:43:20.789 --> 00:43:23.464
Um, you're barking up the
wrong tree here, Sarah, ok?


739
00:43:23.488 --> 00:43:24.856
Yeah? Really?

740
00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:25.466
Is that why you contacted
Lieutenant Stern?


741
00:43:25.490 --> 00:43:26.684
Who?

742
00:43:26.708 --> 00:43:28.228
I didn't even tell
you about the notes.


743
00:43:28.252 --> 00:43:28.968
How did you know about them?

744
00:43:28.992 --> 00:43:30.079
I don't. I didn't.

745
00:43:30.103 --> 00:43:31.559
I mean, until just now.

746
00:43:31.583 --> 00:43:32.864
Wait, somebody's stalking you?

747
00:43:32.888 --> 00:43:34.528
Oh, ok, now you're going
to play innocent?


748
00:43:34.552 --> 00:43:35.867
Right. Ok.

749
00:43:35.891 --> 00:43:37.173
He said someone contacted him

750
00:43:37.197 --> 00:43:40.045
and it was a concerned friend.

751
00:43:40.069 --> 00:43:41.869
You and my husband and
Julie are the only ones


752
00:43:41.893 --> 00:43:44.310
who even know about
this, Jackson.


753
00:43:44.334 --> 00:43:46.922
Ok, look.

754
00:43:46.946 --> 00:43:50.142
Um, I didn't call anybody
about this problem of yours.


755
00:43:50.166 --> 00:43:52.206
I didn't even know you had
a problem until just now.


756
00:43:52.230 --> 00:43:54.451
Secondly, I don't know
Lieutenant Stern,


757
00:43:54.475 --> 00:43:56.888
let alone have had conversations
with him, and third,


758
00:43:56.912 --> 00:43:59.674
I don't know anything
about any notes, ok?


759
00:43:59.698 --> 00:44:01.589
Until you just told me just now.

760
00:44:01.613 --> 00:44:02.981
Don't try and tell me...

761
00:44:03.005 --> 00:44:03.634
The truth?

762
00:44:03.658 --> 00:44:04.766
The truth.

763
00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:06.158
You want me to lie?

764
00:44:06.182 --> 00:44:11.512
You want me to tell you lies?

765
00:44:11.536 --> 00:44:13.451
Well if it wasn't
you and Kurt...


766
00:44:16.410 --> 00:44:19.302
Julie.

767
00:44:19.326 --> 00:44:20.869
Ah, Julie.

768
00:44:20.893 --> 00:44:21.609
You know what though?

769
00:44:21.633 --> 00:44:22.827
If she did it I'm sure

770
00:44:22.851 --> 00:44:24.568
she was just looking
out for your safety.


771
00:44:24.592 --> 00:44:25.830
I mean, Julie is loyal.

772
00:44:25.854 --> 00:44:27.397
Yeah, you'd like to think.

773
00:44:27.421 --> 00:44:29.704
Um... so I'm off the...

774
00:44:29.728 --> 00:44:33.490
I'm not the suspect anymore?

775
00:44:33.514 --> 00:44:34.535
Awesome.

776
00:44:34.559 --> 00:44:35.623
Sarah, look.

777
00:44:35.647 --> 00:44:36.967
We've got to talk
about something.


778
00:44:36.991 --> 00:44:38.452
You really just kinda
need to relax,


779
00:44:38.476 --> 00:44:41.367
let these walls come
down and trust people.


780
00:44:41.391 --> 00:44:44.545
Maybe your life would
get a bit happier.


781
00:44:44.569 --> 00:44:48.549
Oh, and don't miss our

782
00:44:48.573 --> 00:44:56.573
we can't have this campaign
explode in our faces.


783
00:44:58.583 --> 00:45:06.583
We can't have this campaign
explode in our faces.


784
00:45:11.703 --> 00:45:12.703
Sarah Miller's desk...

785
00:45:12.727 --> 00:45:13.530
Julie, it's Kurt again.

786
00:45:13.554 --> 00:45:14.313
Where the hell is my wife?

787
00:45:14.337 --> 00:45:16.446
I really don't know.

788
00:45:16.470 --> 00:45:19.710
She just ran off but
I'm sure she's ok.


789
00:45:19.734 --> 00:45:23.235
Do you want me to
go look for her?


790
00:45:23.259 --> 00:45:24.802
Just...

791
00:45:24.826 --> 00:45:26.306
hold on a second.

792
00:45:37.796 --> 00:45:39.319
It's mail. Nothing.

793
00:45:43.715 --> 00:45:45.170
Hello again, Mr. Miller.

794
00:45:45.194 --> 00:45:46.476
You called this in?

795
00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:48.173
Yeah.

796
00:45:48.197 --> 00:45:49.597
I don't know if
you're aware of this


797
00:45:49.621 --> 00:45:52.351
but it's a federal crime
to report a fake bomb.


798
00:45:52.375 --> 00:45:54.136
What was in the box?

799
00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:55.267
Your mail.

800
00:45:55.291 --> 00:45:56.660
No ticking packages.

801
00:45:56.684 --> 00:45:59.097
It was there this morning.

802
00:45:59.121 --> 00:46:01.186
Did anyone else see the package?

803
00:46:01.210 --> 00:46:02.579
The mailman saw it,

804
00:46:02.603 --> 00:46:04.494
that's why he couldn't
put my mail in the box.


805
00:46:04.518 --> 00:46:06.844
Look, my wife and I are
not making this up.


806
00:46:06.868 --> 00:46:08.708
Louise, did you see anybody
tampering in there?


807
00:46:08.732 --> 00:46:10.292
Maybe somebody took
it away when I left.


808
00:46:10.316 --> 00:46:11.848
No, it was just the mailman.

809
00:46:16.051 --> 00:46:18.900
Ok, let's wrap it up!

810
00:46:18.924 --> 00:46:20.162
Hey, Kurt?

811
00:46:20.186 --> 00:46:21.293
Kurt?

812
00:46:21.317 --> 00:46:23.252
Are you still there?

813
00:46:23.276 --> 00:46:24.558
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

814
00:46:24.582 --> 00:46:26.168
Sorry, Julie.

815
00:46:26.192 --> 00:46:27.125
Just let me know as soon
as my wife gets back.


816
00:46:27.149 --> 00:46:27.778
Yeah, of course.

817
00:46:27.802 --> 00:46:29.258
I will do.

818
00:46:29.282 --> 00:46:31.042
And don't worry, everything
is gonna be fine.


819
00:46:31.066 --> 00:46:33.305
If you need anything at
all just let me know, ok?


820
00:46:33.329 --> 00:46:34.437
Thanks, Julie.

821
00:46:34.461 --> 00:46:35.767
Bye.

822
00:46:36.942 --> 00:46:38.397
Who was that, Julie?

823
00:46:38.421 --> 00:46:39.741
Oh good, Mrs. Miller,
you're here.


824
00:46:39.765 --> 00:46:40.524
Who was on the phone?

825
00:46:40.548 --> 00:46:41.575
That was your husband.

826
00:46:41.599 --> 00:46:45.100
You need to call him
back right now.


827
00:46:45.124 --> 00:46:47.668
You've been getting pretty
friendly with Kurt, haven't you?


828
00:46:47.692 --> 00:46:48.669
Yeah, I guess.

829
00:46:48.693 --> 00:46:49.583
I'm just trying to be...

830
00:46:49.607 --> 00:46:50.888
Helpful.

831
00:46:50.912 --> 00:46:52.673
Yes, Mrs. Miller.

832
00:46:52.697 --> 00:46:53.891
Yeah.

833
00:46:53.915 --> 00:46:55.589
I don't know what
I'd do without you.


834
00:46:55.613 --> 00:46:57.413
I mean, you practically
know what I'm gonna do


835
00:46:57.437 --> 00:46:59.331
before I even do it.

836
00:46:59.355 --> 00:47:02.160
You have access to my
emails, my phone numbers,


837
00:47:02.184 --> 00:47:03.771
my whole life.

838
00:47:03.795 --> 00:47:05.468
If I've overstepped
my boundaries, I...


839
00:47:05.492 --> 00:47:06.643
I'd say calling the police

840
00:47:06.667 --> 00:47:08.645
is a little bit of
an overstep, Julie.


841
00:47:08.669 --> 00:47:10.516
I didn't call the police,
they called you.


842
00:47:10.540 --> 00:47:13.345
Yeah, and who told
them to call me?


843
00:47:13.369 --> 00:47:14.729
I don't know,
probably your husband


844
00:47:14.753 --> 00:47:16.087
because of the bomb scare.

845
00:47:16.111 --> 00:47:17.306
What?

846
00:47:17.330 --> 00:47:18.524
At your house.

847
00:47:18.548 --> 00:47:19.482
What are you talking about?

848
00:47:19.506 --> 00:47:20.831
Is everybody ok?

849
00:47:20.855 --> 00:47:22.790
Yes, everyone is fine,
and from what I gathered


850
00:47:22.814 --> 00:47:25.096
it was a false alarm, but Mr.
Miller sounded


851
00:47:25.120 --> 00:47:27.055
really, really shaken up.

852
00:47:27.079 --> 00:47:28.143
You need to call him back.

853
00:47:28.167 --> 00:47:28.883
Yeah, yeah.

854
00:47:28.907 --> 00:47:29.797
Get Kurt on the line.

855
00:47:29.821 --> 00:47:31.450
Ok.

856
00:47:31.474 --> 00:47:33.514
Wait, Julie, get Lieutenant
Stern on the line first.


857
00:47:33.538 --> 00:47:35.279
Ok.

858
00:47:35.630 --> 00:47:36.630
Julie?

859
00:47:36.654 --> 00:47:38.283
Yeah?

860
00:47:38.307 --> 00:47:40.547
I gotta see him in person,
it's the 28th division, right?


861
00:47:40.571 --> 00:47:41.547
Yeah, I believe so.

862
00:47:41.571 --> 00:47:42.940
Ok, that's downtown.

863
00:47:42.964 --> 00:47:44.644
Wait, what about your
meeting with Solomon?


864
00:47:44.668 --> 00:47:45.377
Cover it for me.

865
00:47:45.401 --> 00:47:46.857
I'll call Kurt from the road.

866
00:47:46.881 --> 00:47:48.206
How are you going to call
Kurt without a cell phone?


867
00:47:48.230 --> 00:47:50.121
I haven't had a chance
to go buy you a new one.


868
00:47:50.145 --> 00:47:51.209
Well, give me yours.

869
00:47:51.233 --> 00:47:53.037
Mine?

870
00:47:53.061 --> 00:47:54.604
Yeah, Julie, you're
my assistant.


871
00:47:54.628 --> 00:47:55.760
Assist.

872
00:47:59.894 --> 00:48:01.829
What's the matter?

873
00:48:01.853 --> 00:48:03.985
Is there something you
don't want me to see?


874
00:48:05.508 --> 00:48:06.858
Nope.

875
00:48:08.773 --> 00:48:10.122
Thank you.

876
00:48:15.127 --> 00:48:17.845
Where's she going
in such a hurry?


877
00:48:17.869 --> 00:48:19.673
Out.

878
00:48:19.697 --> 00:48:21.786
With my phone.

879
00:48:24.614 --> 00:48:27.463
It was there, I saw it, our
family is in danger, Sarah!


880
00:48:27.487 --> 00:48:28.943
Yeah, okay.

881
00:48:28.967 --> 00:48:30.487
We can't do nothing
about this anymore!


882
00:48:30.511 --> 00:48:32.686
I know.

883
00:48:32.710 --> 00:48:34.426
I'm freaking out, okay.

884
00:48:34.450 --> 00:48:35.253
Yeah.

885
00:48:35.277 --> 00:48:36.167
Get back here soon!

886
00:48:36.191 --> 00:48:37.168
Well, ok.

887
00:48:37.192 --> 00:48:38.387
Yeah.

888
00:48:38.411 --> 00:48:39.388
Thank god nobody was hurt!

889
00:48:39.412 --> 00:48:40.563
As long as everyone's safe.

890
00:48:40.587 --> 00:48:41.695
Define safe.

891
00:48:41.719 --> 00:48:43.174
Teri is safe, you're ok.

892
00:48:43.198 --> 00:48:44.598
I'm fine and Teri
doesn't even know.


893
00:48:44.622 --> 00:48:47.135
Ok, um... well, I'm
going to be home early,


894
00:48:47.159 --> 00:48:48.745
I just have to check
on something.


895
00:48:48.769 --> 00:48:50.355
Be careful! Extra careful!!

896
00:48:50.379 --> 00:48:51.313
I love you.

897
00:48:51.337 --> 00:48:51.792
I love you too.

898
00:48:51.816 --> 00:48:52.793
Ok.

899
00:48:52.817 --> 00:48:53.707
I mean it, I love you!

900
00:48:53.731 --> 00:48:54.708
Ok, bye.

901
00:48:54.732 --> 00:48:55.950
Bye!

902
00:48:58.257 --> 00:49:00.999
Hi. I need to speak
with Lieutenant Stern.


903
00:49:04.829 --> 00:49:05.849
Are you Lieutenant Stern?

904
00:49:05.873 --> 00:49:06.807
No, Captain Tanner.

905
00:49:06.831 --> 00:49:08.286
And you are?

906
00:49:08.310 --> 00:49:09.461
I'm Sarah Miller.

907
00:49:09.485 --> 00:49:10.636
Lieutenant Stern knows who I am.

908
00:49:10.660 --> 00:49:12.100
It's very important
I speak with him.


909
00:49:12.124 --> 00:49:13.101
I'm afraid that's impossible.

910
00:49:13.125 --> 00:49:15.772
Officer Stern died
five years ago.


911
00:49:15.796 --> 00:49:17.818
What?

912
00:49:17.842 --> 00:49:19.210
It's him.

913
00:49:19.234 --> 00:49:19.950
Excuse me?

914
00:49:19.974 --> 00:49:21.367
What did you say?

915
00:49:23.848 --> 00:49:25.371
Excuse me?

916
00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:28.480
It's nothing.

917
00:49:28.504 --> 00:49:30.656
Um, nothing, sorry.

918
00:49:30.680 --> 00:49:32.600
Would you care to step
into my office to discuss?


919
00:49:32.624 --> 00:49:34.269
No, thank you.

920
00:49:34.293 --> 00:49:35.893
I must have made a
mistake with the name.


921
00:49:35.917 --> 00:49:37.745
I'm sorry to have bothered you.

922
00:49:49.351 --> 00:49:52.156
Look who's home early.

923
00:49:52.180 --> 00:49:53.941
Look what I drew
at school today.


924
00:49:53.965 --> 00:49:56.900
There's me, daddy,
and there's you.


925
00:49:56.924 --> 00:50:00.904
Oh, that's beautiful.

926
00:50:00.928 --> 00:50:02.384
Thank you, honey.

927
00:50:02.408 --> 00:50:05.604
This is the most beautiful
thing I've seen all day.


928
00:50:05.628 --> 00:50:06.934
We'll have to get it framed.

929
00:50:13.593 --> 00:50:18.269
Ok, well, to celebrate this
beautiful picture you drew me,


930
00:50:18.293 --> 00:50:19.793
who wants to go get ice cream?

931
00:50:19.817 --> 00:50:21.359
Me!

932
00:50:21.383 --> 00:50:22.491
Me.

933
00:50:22.515 --> 00:50:24.362
Go grab your jacket
upstairs, ok?


934
00:50:24.386 --> 00:50:25.735
Ok!

935
00:50:30.044 --> 00:50:32.893
What's wrong?

936
00:50:32.917 --> 00:50:33.894
A lot of things.

937
00:50:33.918 --> 00:50:35.373
But first thing's first.

938
00:50:35.397 --> 00:50:36.984
You said it was
just you and George


939
00:50:37.008 --> 00:50:38.463
who saw the package
in the mail box?


940
00:50:38.487 --> 00:50:40.248
No, it was some new guy.

941
00:50:40.272 --> 00:50:42.337
Harold. Harold Martin.

942
00:50:42.361 --> 00:50:43.991
What happened to George?

943
00:50:44.015 --> 00:50:47.037
I don't know, family emergency.

944
00:50:47.061 --> 00:50:47.777
All ready?

945
00:50:47.801 --> 00:50:48.473
Yeah.

946
00:50:48.497 --> 00:50:49.735
Ok. Let's go.

947
00:50:49.759 --> 00:50:51.022
Let's go, come on.

948
00:50:57.919 --> 00:50:59.119
You could describe him, right?

949
00:50:59.143 --> 00:51:00.398
The new postman.

950
00:51:00.422 --> 00:51:01.530
Yes, but he said he didn't
deliver the package.


951
00:51:01.554 --> 00:51:02.994
It was already there
when he arrived.


952
00:51:03.018 --> 00:51:03.734
Well maybe he can tell
us a little more.


953
00:51:03.758 --> 00:51:05.751
Right over here.

954
00:51:05.775 --> 00:51:07.575
Um, I'm going to need to
talk to your manager.


955
00:51:07.599 --> 00:51:09.059
I'm the manager, how
can I help you?


956
00:51:09.083 --> 00:51:11.003
We have a question for one
of your mail carriers.


957
00:51:11.027 --> 00:51:12.323
Harold Martin?

958
00:51:12.347 --> 00:51:14.187
He said he was replacing
our original mail man.


959
00:51:14.211 --> 00:51:15.109
George Reiner?

960
00:51:15.133 --> 00:51:17.763
About five foot nine,
glasses, talked a lot.


961
00:51:17.787 --> 00:51:18.867
It's not ringing any bells.

962
00:51:18.891 --> 00:51:20.766
You say he's replacing
George Reiner?


963
00:51:20.790 --> 00:51:21.680
Yes.

964
00:51:21.704 --> 00:51:22.856
George Reiner is on vacation

965
00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:25.206
but his replacement
is Nancy Johnson.


966
00:51:25.230 --> 00:51:26.685
Are you sure?

967
00:51:26.709 --> 00:51:28.229
Well then who the
hell is Harold Martin


968
00:51:28.253 --> 00:51:30.124
and why did he have
access to our mail?


969
00:51:30.148 --> 00:51:32.866
I have no idea, but he
doesn't work for us.


970
00:51:32.890 --> 00:51:34.490
If you want to file a
formal complaint...


971
00:51:34.514 --> 00:51:36.130
No, that won't be necessary.

972
00:51:36.154 --> 00:51:39.611
Thank you.

973
00:51:39.635 --> 00:51:40.786
He's toying with us.

974
00:51:40.810 --> 00:51:42.029
Who?

975
00:51:45.859 --> 00:51:47.165
Where's Teri?

976
00:51:52.605 --> 00:51:53.823
Teri!

977
00:51:59.307 --> 00:52:00.569
There, there!

978
00:52:10.275 --> 00:52:11.319
Come on, come on!!!!

979
00:52:15.454 --> 00:52:16.692
That's him!

980
00:52:16.716 --> 00:52:18.196
That's the post man
from this morning.


981
00:52:18.220 --> 00:52:19.695
KPJ I271.

982
00:52:19.719 --> 00:52:21.740
Teri!

983
00:52:21.764 --> 00:52:24.961
KPJ I271.

984
00:52:24.985 --> 00:52:28.225
Oh my god, please never wander
off like that again, ok?


985
00:52:28.249 --> 00:52:29.792
You scared us half to death.

986
00:52:29.816 --> 00:52:31.856
But I just wanted to pick
out what kind of ice cream


987
00:52:31.880 --> 00:52:33.011
I wanted to have.

988
00:52:37.302 --> 00:52:39.584
Uh, three large cones please.

989
00:52:39.608 --> 00:52:40.958
Sure. What flavor
you folks like?


990
00:52:56.147 --> 00:52:58.342
Take Teri to Louise's now!

991
00:52:58.366 --> 00:52:58.952
What is it?

992
00:52:58.976 --> 00:53:00.736
Just go.

993
00:53:00.760 --> 00:53:02.980
Come on, let's go visit
Aunt Louise right now.


994
00:53:11.205 --> 00:53:18.623
Pictures can't hurt
you, but people can.


995
00:53:18.647 --> 00:53:19.909
Nine?

996
00:53:31.681 --> 00:53:32.681
Yes?

997
00:53:32.705 --> 00:53:34.204
Hey, it's me. It's Julie.

998
00:53:34.228 --> 00:53:36.032
Where did you disappear to?

999
00:53:36.056 --> 00:53:38.861
I did my best to cover but Mr.
Solomon is really upset


1000
00:53:38.885 --> 00:53:40.645
that you missed the meeting.

1001
00:53:40.669 --> 00:53:43.213
There's talk of firing you.

1002
00:53:43.237 --> 00:53:44.301
Who's saying that?

1003
00:53:44.325 --> 00:53:45.955
Mr. Solomon.

1004
00:53:45.979 --> 00:53:46.564
Well, you know what?

1005
00:53:46.588 --> 00:53:47.652
Let him say it.

1006
00:53:47.676 --> 00:53:49.045
I can't worry about
that right now.


1007
00:53:49.069 --> 00:53:50.960
Who else knows I have
your cell, Julie?


1008
00:53:50.984 --> 00:53:52.918
Besides me?

1009
00:53:52.942 --> 00:53:54.833
Yes, besides you.

1010
00:53:54.857 --> 00:53:58.446
I may have mentioned it
in passing to Jackson.


1011
00:53:58.470 --> 00:53:59.403
Anyone else?

1012
00:53:59.427 --> 00:54:01.231
Like who?

1013
00:54:01.255 --> 00:54:03.146
Like the person trying
to destroy my life.


1014
00:54:03.170 --> 00:54:05.148
Ok, now you're starting
to scare me, Mrs. Miller.


1015
00:54:05.172 --> 00:54:06.478
Yeah, you and me both.

1016
00:54:28.456 --> 00:54:29.564
Hello?

1017
00:54:29.588 --> 00:54:31.348
Sarah Miller.

1018
00:54:31.372 --> 00:54:32.654
Who is this?

1019
00:54:32.678 --> 00:54:35.004
It's Lieutenant Stern
calling again.


1020
00:54:35.028 --> 00:54:36.658
Lieutenant Stern is dead.

1021
00:54:36.682 --> 00:54:41.837
Oh, I mean it's Harold
Martin from the post office.


1022
00:54:41.861 --> 00:54:44.753
I was just calling to see
if you received my package.


1023
00:54:44.777 --> 00:54:46.937
There is no Harold Martin who
works at the post office.


1024
00:54:46.961 --> 00:54:48.148
Who the hell is this?

1025
00:54:48.172 --> 00:54:50.063
Well now that's the
million dollar question,


1026
00:54:50.087 --> 00:54:51.740
isn't it, Sarah?

1027
00:54:54.613 --> 00:54:56.286
What do you want from me?

1028
00:54:56.310 --> 00:54:58.419
Maybe I don't want anything.

1029
00:54:58.443 --> 00:55:00.160
Maybe someone else
wants a job done


1030
00:55:00.184 --> 00:55:03.772
and I'm just the guy
they hired to do it.


1031
00:55:03.796 --> 00:55:08.211
Situations like this, they
do arise from time to time.


1032
00:55:08.235 --> 00:55:09.604
Who hired you?

1033
00:55:09.628 --> 00:55:11.258
Now, now.

1034
00:55:11.282 --> 00:55:15.479
Wouldn't be much of a game if
I told you all the answers.


1035
00:55:15.503 --> 00:55:18.613
That's a real nice family
you've got there, Sarah.


1036
00:55:18.637 --> 00:55:20.702
You think you can
hold on to them?


1037
00:55:20.726 --> 00:55:25.054
I personally know some
families who weren't so lucky.


1038
00:55:25.078 --> 00:55:27.230
Is that another threat?

1039
00:55:27.254 --> 00:55:30.625
Things happen for
a reason, Sarah.


1040
00:55:30.649 --> 00:55:33.149
It might not be
obvious at first,


1041
00:55:33.173 --> 00:55:35.412
but everything has a
cause and effect.


1042
00:55:35.436 --> 00:55:36.892
A beginning and an end.

1043
00:55:36.916 --> 00:55:43.812
A sender and a receiver.

1044
00:55:43.836 --> 00:55:47.250
It just takes a while
to figure it all out.


1045
00:55:47.274 --> 00:55:49.948
And the clock is ticking, Sarah.

1046
00:55:49.972 --> 00:55:53.604
Or wasn't my package
clear enough?


1047
00:55:53.628 --> 00:55:55.215
That's the thing
about your package.


1048
00:55:55.239 --> 00:55:56.738
I didn't receive it.

1049
00:55:56.762 --> 00:55:58.762
Because you took it away
before the police arrived.


1050
00:55:58.786 --> 00:56:01.308
Well, it wasn't meant for them.

1051
00:56:01.332 --> 00:56:04.572
You have to open it, Sarah.

1052
00:56:04.596 --> 00:56:08.663
Ok, well tell me where you
are and I'll be right over.


1053
00:56:08.687 --> 00:56:11.733
No need, look under the bed.

1054
00:56:18.566 --> 00:56:22.764
Don't worry, it's not the kind
of gift that goes "boom".


1055
00:56:22.788 --> 00:56:25.767
That's not my style.

1056
00:56:25.791 --> 00:56:27.812
Open it.

1057
00:56:27.836 --> 00:56:29.510
Look inside.

1058
00:56:29.534 --> 00:56:32.730
There's a special little
something in there just for you.


1059
00:56:32.754 --> 00:56:34.776
Do you want money or something?

1060
00:56:34.800 --> 00:56:37.039
Is that what this is about?

1061
00:56:37.063 --> 00:56:38.743
Because I'm pretty sure
I just lost my job.


1062
00:56:38.767 --> 00:56:39.955
Money.

1063
00:56:39.979 --> 00:56:43.741
It's not about money, Sarah.

1064
00:56:43.765 --> 00:56:45.308
It's about family.

1065
00:56:45.332 --> 00:56:49.269
Family is everything.

1066
00:56:49.293 --> 00:56:54.491
Can you protect those nearest
and dearest to your heart?


1067
00:56:54.515 --> 00:56:58.171
Because you never know when
it could all just slip away.


1068
00:57:03.220 --> 00:57:04.849
Tick tock, Sarah.

1069
00:57:04.873 --> 00:57:06.721
Tick tock.

1070
00:57:06.745 --> 00:57:08.853
I'll see you soon.

1071
00:57:08.877 --> 00:57:10.420
When?

1072
00:57:10.444 --> 00:57:12.117
When and where are
you gonna see me?


1073
00:57:12.141 --> 00:57:14.294
'Cause I'm ready, you bastard.

1074
00:57:14.318 --> 00:57:17.558
I'll chime back in
around nine tonight.


1075
00:57:17.582 --> 00:57:19.236
If you're at home.

1076
00:57:26.132 --> 00:57:27.132
Sarah?

1077
00:57:27.156 --> 00:57:29.483
Woah!

1078
00:57:29.507 --> 00:57:30.943
Hey.

1079
00:57:34.425 --> 00:57:38.187
Where did that come from?

1080
00:57:38.211 --> 00:57:39.710
He's been in our house.

1081
00:57:39.734 --> 00:57:40.624
He's been in our house again.

1082
00:57:40.648 --> 00:57:42.104
We have to go.

1083
00:57:42.128 --> 00:57:44.976
We have to pack and
we have to get Teri


1084
00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:45.934
and we have to get out of here.

1085
00:57:45.958 --> 00:57:47.109
Now.

1086
00:57:47.133 --> 00:57:48.482
Ok.

1087
00:57:49.678 --> 00:57:50.678
Thanks again, Louise.

1088
00:57:50.702 --> 00:57:51.635
Oh, it's no problem at all.

1089
00:57:51.659 --> 00:57:53.202
I just hope everything's ok.

1090
00:57:53.226 --> 00:57:55.509
I mean, you're welcome to stay.

1091
00:57:55.533 --> 00:57:57.902
You guys are like family to me.

1092
00:57:57.926 --> 00:58:00.992
They are not your
family, Louise.


1093
00:58:01.016 --> 00:58:04.387
I am well aware of that, Sarah.

1094
00:58:04.411 --> 00:58:06.998
I just thought that after
the bomb scare today...


1095
00:58:07.022 --> 00:58:08.522
How do you know about that?

1096
00:58:08.546 --> 00:58:10.175
Everybody knows about it.

1097
00:58:10.199 --> 00:58:11.176
They closed down
the whole block.


1098
00:58:11.200 --> 00:58:12.360
Louise was there when they...

1099
00:58:12.384 --> 00:58:14.484
Found nothing?

1100
00:58:14.508 --> 00:58:16.921
Oh, that's convenient.

1101
00:58:16.945 --> 00:58:17.792
Are you implying...

1102
00:58:17.816 --> 00:58:19.097
No, no, no.

1103
00:58:19.121 --> 00:58:20.925
Absolutely not.

1104
00:58:20.949 --> 00:58:22.666
Thanks again, Louise.

1105
00:58:22.690 --> 00:58:25.321
We're gonna get away
for a little while,


1106
00:58:25.345 --> 00:58:26.844
but you've been a great friend.

1107
00:58:26.868 --> 00:58:29.760
Look, you take care
of yourself and Teri.


1108
00:58:29.784 --> 00:58:31.849
If you need anything,
you call me.


1109
00:58:31.873 --> 00:58:32.633
I will.

1110
00:58:32.657 --> 00:58:35.312
Thank you.

1111
00:58:36.095 --> 00:58:38.073
Hey, it's me.

1112
00:58:38.097 --> 00:58:40.249
I've just discovered that
my office has been bugged.


1113
00:58:40.273 --> 00:58:42.338
The boys in blue are
watching me now


1114
00:58:42.362 --> 00:58:45.385
so all assignments are
on permanent hold.


1115
00:58:45.409 --> 00:58:48.039
It isn't safe anymore.

1116
00:58:48.063 --> 00:58:50.718
You're on your own.

1117
00:59:19.356 --> 00:59:20.420
Room 129 around back.

1118
00:59:20.444 --> 00:59:21.967
Just follow me, ok?

1119
00:59:30.323 --> 00:59:32.432
Make sure to wash
behind your ears.


1120
00:59:32.456 --> 00:59:33.805
Ok.

1121
00:59:39.463 --> 00:59:40.918
What is this?

1122
00:59:40.942 --> 00:59:43.443
Who are all these people?

1123
00:59:43.467 --> 00:59:45.488
They look like
dead people to me.


1124
00:59:45.512 --> 00:59:48.709
I think the message is
petty obvious, don't you?


1125
00:59:48.733 --> 00:59:50.624
Well, this definitely
looks like a threat now.


1126
00:59:50.648 --> 00:59:53.627
Something we can go
to the police with.


1127
00:59:53.651 --> 00:59:58.458
That's not the only threat
I received today, Kurt.


1128
00:59:58.482 --> 01:00:00.682
I was able to take a screen
grab of the photo this time.


1129
01:00:00.706 --> 01:00:03.637
Silence is golden.

1130
01:00:03.661 --> 01:00:06.011
Look at the picture
that came with it.


1131
01:00:09.165 --> 01:00:10.165
Yeah.

1132
01:00:10.189 --> 01:00:11.471
We can't go to the police.

1133
01:00:11.495 --> 01:00:14.169
I can't chance it, not
with you and Teri.


1134
01:00:14.193 --> 01:00:16.084
Who is this guy?

1135
01:00:16.108 --> 01:00:18.108
I don't know, that's what
I'm trying to figure out.


1136
01:00:18.132 --> 01:00:21.092
Who's behind him
pulling the strings?


1137
01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:22.960
Oh, great.

1138
01:00:22.984 --> 01:00:24.571
It's Victoria.

1139
01:00:24.595 --> 01:00:26.248
Answer it.

1140
01:00:28.947 --> 01:00:30.925
What is it, Vicki?

1141
01:00:30.949 --> 01:00:31.926
We need to talk.

1142
01:00:31.950 --> 01:00:33.884
It's not a good time.

1143
01:00:33.908 --> 01:00:34.885
Where are you?

1144
01:00:34.909 --> 01:00:36.104
I'm out.

1145
01:00:36.128 --> 01:00:37.235
Out where?

1146
01:00:37.259 --> 01:00:40.195
It doesn't matter
where, I'm out.


1147
01:00:40.219 --> 01:00:41.588
Is my daughter with you?

1148
01:00:41.612 --> 01:00:44.329
Teri is fine, she's
with me, yes.


1149
01:00:44.353 --> 01:00:45.548
Well, is she ok?

1150
01:00:45.572 --> 01:00:47.158
Yes, she's fine.

1151
01:00:47.182 --> 01:00:48.812
Well, I want to see her.

1152
01:00:48.836 --> 01:00:50.423
Well, you can't.

1153
01:00:50.447 --> 01:00:52.337
If I can't see her I'm
calling child services.


1154
01:00:52.361 --> 01:00:53.904
Go ahead. Do it.

1155
01:00:53.928 --> 01:00:56.167
I don't care.

1156
01:00:56.191 --> 01:00:58.431
What'd she say?

1157
01:00:58.455 --> 01:00:59.910
Same thing she tells
me all the time.


1158
01:00:59.934 --> 01:01:01.614
That she's going to
take Teri away from me.


1159
01:01:01.638 --> 01:01:05.046
She's going to ruin my life.

1160
01:01:05.070 --> 01:01:08.310
She's got to wait in line, now.

1161
01:01:08.334 --> 01:01:11.313
If she's behind this I bet
she's jumping for joy.


1162
01:01:11.337 --> 01:01:12.923
Do you really think
she's in on this?


1163
01:01:12.947 --> 01:01:14.403
She has a good enough motive.

1164
01:01:14.427 --> 01:01:17.145
She wants Teri.

1165
01:01:17.169 --> 01:01:22.237
Of course, Louise wants Teri
and you all to herself.


1166
01:01:22.261 --> 01:01:24.341
I just have to worry about
Jackson, who wants my job.


1167
01:01:24.365 --> 01:01:26.676
Well, probably has it by now.

1168
01:01:26.700 --> 01:01:28.112
And Julie...

1169
01:01:28.136 --> 01:01:29.940
What about Julie?

1170
01:01:29.964 --> 01:01:31.812
That's her cell phone.

1171
01:01:31.836 --> 01:01:33.509
The threat came to
me on that phone.


1172
01:01:33.533 --> 01:01:36.817
No one knew I borrowed
it except for her.


1173
01:01:36.841 --> 01:01:39.210
Wait, give me your cell phone.

1174
01:01:39.234 --> 01:01:40.864
What're you looking for?

1175
01:01:40.888 --> 01:01:43.040
To see if you've been tapped.

1176
01:01:43.064 --> 01:01:44.694
Once they get into
someone's system


1177
01:01:44.718 --> 01:01:47.305
they can triangulate where you
are, access your address books,


1178
01:01:47.329 --> 01:01:50.657
your contacts, everything.

1179
01:01:50.681 --> 01:01:54.965
It's scary how easy it is.

1180
01:01:54.989 --> 01:01:57.925
They can get to anyone calling
you, anyone you call.


1181
01:01:57.949 --> 01:01:59.361
This is like a nightmare.

1182
01:01:59.385 --> 01:02:02.930
Yeah, except that it's real.

1183
01:02:02.954 --> 01:02:04.912
Just to be safe.

1184
01:02:10.657 --> 01:02:11.765
Daddy?

1185
01:02:11.789 --> 01:02:13.897
Betty and Cheryl are hungry.

1186
01:02:13.921 --> 01:02:17.335
Me too.

1187
01:02:17.359 --> 01:02:19.039
You want to find out
what Teri wants to eat


1188
01:02:19.063 --> 01:02:20.600
and I'll call take out?

1189
01:02:20.624 --> 01:02:22.234
Yeah.

1190
01:02:39.860 --> 01:02:43.579
Hello, Harrison Car Rentals,
how can I help you?


1191
01:02:43.603 --> 01:02:44.232
Oh, great.

1192
01:02:44.256 --> 01:02:44.972
You're still open.

1193
01:02:44.996 --> 01:02:45.842
Well, yeah.

1194
01:02:45.866 --> 01:02:47.322
We shouldn't be, though.

1195
01:02:47.346 --> 01:02:48.062
The owner's making me
re-file everything.


1196
01:02:48.086 --> 01:02:49.890
It totally sucks.

1197
01:02:49.914 --> 01:02:52.457
I'm sorry to hear that.

1198
01:02:52.481 --> 01:02:55.722
This is a little bit awkward.

1199
01:02:55.746 --> 01:02:57.332
I had a bit of a fender bender

1200
01:02:57.356 --> 01:02:59.377
with one of your
rental cars today.


1201
01:02:59.401 --> 01:03:01.118
Oh great, more paperwork.

1202
01:03:01.142 --> 01:03:03.599
Well, maybe I can
help out with that.


1203
01:03:03.623 --> 01:03:05.223
The man that I hit was
very nice about it


1204
01:03:05.247 --> 01:03:06.920
and we're fixing the
damages ourselves


1205
01:03:06.944 --> 01:03:09.518
so that you won't be
burdened by more paperwork.


1206
01:03:09.542 --> 01:03:12.042
I just...

1207
01:03:12.066 --> 01:03:14.175
I misplaced the address
that he gave me


1208
01:03:14.199 --> 01:03:15.839
and I don't know where
to send the cheque.


1209
01:03:15.863 --> 01:03:17.657
Would you be a dear and
look it up for me?


1210
01:03:17.681 --> 01:03:20.703
I'm sure you have his
license on file, right?


1211
01:03:20.727 --> 01:03:23.271
I have the license plate number.

1212
01:03:23.295 --> 01:03:24.664
Are you ready?

1213
01:03:24.688 --> 01:03:28.842
It's KPJI271.

1214
01:03:28.866 --> 01:03:32.541
I think it was a gold Hyundai.

1215
01:03:32.565 --> 01:03:34.674
Well, I'm really not
supposed to do this


1216
01:03:34.698 --> 01:03:37.720
but it makes my life easier,
so just give me a second.


1217
01:03:37.744 --> 01:03:41.506
Thank you.

1218
01:03:41.530 --> 01:03:45.162
And in other news, police
located international


1219
01:03:45.186 --> 01:03:48.688
assassin Mathieu Diamond,
possibly finally solving


1220
01:03:48.712 --> 01:03:51.691
a string of unsolved homicides

1221
01:03:51.715 --> 01:03:57.566
including the two year old
murder case of Jennifer Serols.


1222
01:03:57.590 --> 01:03:59.990
It's registered to a Vincent
Sturup at 23330 McIntosh Plaza.


1223
01:04:00.014 --> 01:04:01.788
Ok.

1224
01:04:01.812 --> 01:04:04.268
Thank you so much.

1225
01:04:04.292 --> 01:04:08.185
Ok, bye.

1226
01:04:08.209 --> 01:04:11.319
Under surveillance
the last two weeks.


1227
01:04:11.343 --> 01:04:14.322
When police tried to bring him
in he shot at the officers


1228
01:04:14.346 --> 01:04:16.019
who returned fire.

1229
01:04:16.043 --> 01:04:19.501
Mr. Diamond was killed
during the gun play.


1230
01:04:19.525 --> 01:04:21.808
Mr. Mathieu Diamond was...

1231
01:04:21.832 --> 01:04:24.375
She says she wants burgers.

1232
01:04:24.399 --> 01:04:26.726
Was in actuality a contact
person for an organization


1233
01:04:26.750 --> 01:04:29.250
of hired assassins
resulting in the deaths


1234
01:04:29.274 --> 01:04:33.428
of at least two dozen people
over the last few years.


1235
01:04:33.452 --> 01:04:35.517
You idiots.

1236
01:04:35.541 --> 01:04:38.520
Now they're gonna run.

1237
01:04:38.544 --> 01:04:40.851
This ends tonight.

1238
01:04:43.070 --> 01:04:45.135
Do you think that our guy
is involved in this?


1239
01:04:45.159 --> 01:04:47.398
Is this what we're mixed up in?

1240
01:04:47.422 --> 01:04:48.138
It's ok, Kurt.

1241
01:04:48.162 --> 01:04:48.922
No, no, no.

1242
01:04:48.946 --> 01:04:50.445
It is definitely not ok.

1243
01:04:50.469 --> 01:04:51.664
If this guy is a trained
assassin, a trained killer


1244
01:04:51.688 --> 01:04:52.708
it is not ok.

1245
01:04:52.732 --> 01:04:54.928
The police are on the case now.

1246
01:04:54.952 --> 01:04:56.973
So it's going to be ok.

1247
01:04:56.997 --> 01:04:58.192
Right?

1248
01:04:58.216 --> 01:05:00.411
We're fine here, we
just have to relax.


1249
01:05:00.435 --> 01:05:02.762
We're safe.

1250
01:05:02.786 --> 01:05:04.502
Kurt?

1251
01:05:04.526 --> 01:05:05.416
Kurt?

1252
01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:06.330
What?

1253
01:05:06.354 --> 01:05:07.201
Hey, hey.

1254
01:05:07.225 --> 01:05:08.898
What?

1255
01:05:08.922 --> 01:05:12.380
We've gotta eat, right?

1256
01:05:12.404 --> 01:05:13.773
Yeah.

1257
01:05:13.797 --> 01:05:15.992
I think I saw a burger
place on the way here.


1258
01:05:16.016 --> 01:05:17.472
You stay with Teri,

1259
01:05:17.496 --> 01:05:19.256
I'll run and grab something
really quick, ok?


1260
01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:20.214
I'll be right back.

1261
01:05:20.238 --> 01:05:22.259
But you saw the report,
it's too dangerous.


1262
01:05:22.283 --> 01:05:26.394
Ok, well I have this, remember?

1263
01:05:26.418 --> 01:05:28.004
Make you feel better?

1264
01:05:28.028 --> 01:05:31.878
And that guy, whoever it is,
he's on the run right now.


1265
01:05:31.902 --> 01:05:35.664
No hamburger ever killed anyone.

1266
01:05:35.688 --> 01:05:38.493
At least not when
eaten in moderation.


1267
01:05:38.517 --> 01:05:39.973
Aw, come here.

1268
01:05:39.997 --> 01:05:41.757
That was supposed
to make you laugh.


1269
01:05:41.781 --> 01:05:43.870
We're ok.

1270
01:06:03.281 --> 01:06:05.259
It's about family.

1271
01:06:05.283 --> 01:06:07.827
Family is everything.

1272
01:06:07.851 --> 01:06:10.307
I'll chime back in
around 9:00 tonight


1273
01:06:10.331 --> 01:06:14.094
if you're at home.

1274
01:06:14.118 --> 01:06:16.468
Oh, I'll be there.

1275
01:07:37.288 --> 01:07:39.614
Mrs. Miller?

1276
01:07:39.638 --> 01:07:40.963
Julie?

1277
01:07:40.987 --> 01:07:44.271
I needed to speak with
you about something.


1278
01:07:44.295 --> 01:07:45.838
You're three minutes early.

1279
01:07:45.862 --> 01:07:46.926
You were expecting me?

1280
01:07:46.950 --> 01:07:49.450
I was expecting someone.

1281
01:07:49.474 --> 01:07:51.844
I was really concerned after
I spoke with you today.


1282
01:07:51.868 --> 01:07:53.148
Well, you should have called me.

1283
01:07:53.172 --> 01:07:54.759
You of all people
know how to reach me.


1284
01:07:54.783 --> 01:07:56.863
Yeah, but it's not the kind
of thing you tell someone


1285
01:07:56.887 --> 01:07:58.372
over the phone.

1286
01:07:58.396 --> 01:07:59.764
Or with a gun pointed at them.

1287
01:07:59.788 --> 01:08:00.417
I'll decide that.

1288
01:08:00.441 --> 01:08:03.246
Talk.

1289
01:08:03.270 --> 01:08:05.770
You were fired today.

1290
01:08:05.794 --> 01:08:08.295
Me too.

1291
01:08:08.319 --> 01:08:09.818
They let you go?

1292
01:08:09.842 --> 01:08:11.124
Well yeah, there's no point
in having an assistant


1293
01:08:11.148 --> 01:08:12.821
if there's no one
there to assist.


1294
01:08:12.845 --> 01:08:14.301
How did you get in
here, and when?


1295
01:08:14.325 --> 01:08:16.303
The door was wide open
just a minute ago.


1296
01:08:16.327 --> 01:08:17.652
I knocked but no one answered.

1297
01:08:17.676 --> 01:08:20.873
I was really worried, Mrs.
Miller.


1298
01:08:20.897 --> 01:08:23.136
That's it?

1299
01:08:23.160 --> 01:08:25.336
And I kinda needed
my phone back.


1300
01:08:28.556 --> 01:08:30.907
Ok, I believe you.

1301
01:08:32.734 --> 01:08:34.756
What's with the gun?

1302
01:08:34.780 --> 01:08:35.980
When you show up to your house

1303
01:08:36.004 --> 01:08:37.604
and find someone
uninvited walking around


1304
01:08:37.628 --> 01:08:40.762
you take certain precautions.

1305
01:08:40.786 --> 01:08:43.243
No, but there's something
else going on.


1306
01:08:43.267 --> 01:08:44.746
The way you've been
acting this week.


1307
01:08:45.617 --> 01:08:47.445
It's nine o'clock.

1308
01:08:50.187 --> 01:08:52.406
Wait.

1309
01:08:57.020 --> 01:08:59.215
Pictures can't hurt us, right?

1310
01:08:59.239 --> 01:09:01.348
Pictures can't hurt us.

1311
01:09:01.372 --> 01:09:02.653
I love you, Sarah.

1312
01:09:02.677 --> 01:09:05.047
I love you, too.

1313
01:09:05.071 --> 01:09:07.223
Pictures can't hurt us, right?

1314
01:09:07.247 --> 01:09:09.922
Pictures can't hurt us.

1315
01:09:09.946 --> 01:09:11.314
I love you, Sarah.

1316
01:09:11.338 --> 01:09:14.100
I love you, too.

1317
01:09:14.124 --> 01:09:16.015
Pictures can't hurt us, right?

1318
01:09:16.039 --> 01:09:18.713
Pictures can't hurt us.

1319
01:09:18.737 --> 01:09:20.454
I love you, Sarah.

1320
01:09:20.478 --> 01:09:22.499
I love you, too.

1321
01:09:22.523 --> 01:09:24.414
Pictures can't hurt us, right?

1322
01:09:24.438 --> 01:09:26.982
Pictures can't hurt us.

1323
01:09:27.006 --> 01:09:28.549
I love you, Sarah.

1324
01:09:28.573 --> 01:09:30.725
I love you, too.

1325
01:09:30.749 --> 01:09:32.794
Pictures can't hurt us, right?

1326
01:09:36.798 --> 01:09:39.081
Mrs. Miller, what is going on?!

1327
01:09:39.105 --> 01:09:40.300
You drove here, right?

1328
01:09:40.324 --> 01:09:41.804
Yeah, I just parked
across the street.


1329
01:09:41.828 --> 01:09:43.172
I have one last
favor to ask you.


1330
01:09:43.196 --> 01:09:44.806
I need to borrow your car.

1331
01:10:32.115 --> 01:10:33.899
Good evening.

1332
01:11:34.264 --> 01:11:36.483
What the hell?

1333
01:11:56.808 --> 01:12:00.179
You son of a bitch.

1334
01:12:00.203 --> 01:12:02.746
That's how you could
get to all my phones.


1335
01:12:02.770 --> 01:12:04.859
It's in Kurt's cell, I knew it.

1336
01:12:16.523 --> 01:12:24.523
Oh my...

1337
01:12:26.577 --> 01:12:31.842
Oh my...

1338
01:12:31.843 --> 01:12:36.587
Oh my...

1339
01:13:05.181 --> 01:13:06.921
Stupid cops.

1340
01:13:27.899 --> 01:13:28.919
Hello?

1341
01:13:28.943 --> 01:13:30.138
Kurt, it's me.

1342
01:13:30.162 --> 01:13:30.878
Thank god.

1343
01:13:30.902 --> 01:13:31.792
Sarah, where are you?

1344
01:13:31.816 --> 01:13:32.619
I was going to call the police.

1345
01:13:32.643 --> 01:13:34.447
No, don't call the police.

1346
01:13:34.471 --> 01:13:36.536
The guy who's after
us used to be a cop.


1347
01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:37.537
What?

1348
01:13:37.561 --> 01:13:38.799
I'm at his place right now,

1349
01:13:38.823 --> 01:13:39.626
he might still have
friends in the force.


1350
01:13:39.650 --> 01:13:42.194
We can't trust the police.

1351
01:13:42.218 --> 01:13:43.673
But I might have found proof
that can take this guy down


1352
01:13:43.697 --> 01:13:45.240
and put us in the clear.

1353
01:13:45.264 --> 01:13:47.024
I have to run back to
the house for a minute.


1354
01:13:47.048 --> 01:13:49.505
I need you to stay with Teri
and I will be there very soon.


1355
01:13:49.529 --> 01:13:51.725
You can't go back to the
house, it isn't safe.


1356
01:13:51.749 --> 01:13:53.161
I'm going to be fine.

1357
01:13:53.185 --> 01:13:55.903
Everything is going to
be fine now, trust me.


1358
01:13:55.927 --> 01:13:58.340
I love you, Kurt.

1359
01:13:58.364 --> 01:14:00.410
Sarah.

1360
01:14:22.867 --> 01:14:24.584
Louise? It's Kurt.

1361
01:14:24.608 --> 01:14:30.221
I need another favor.

1362
01:14:30.222 --> 01:14:34.618
I need another favor.

1363
01:15:42.576 --> 01:15:43.576
Sarah?

1364
01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:45.229
Kurt?

1365
01:15:45.253 --> 01:15:46.622
Hello, Mr. Miller.

1366
01:15:46.646 --> 01:15:50.452
Remember me?

1367
01:15:50.476 --> 01:15:52.672
It looks like we're out of time.

1368
01:15:52.696 --> 01:15:54.001
When did you get here?

1369
01:15:59.006 --> 01:16:00.791
I had to stop off and get gas.

1370
01:16:12.498 --> 01:16:16.870
So here we are.

1371
01:16:16.894 --> 01:16:18.175
Where's Teri?

1372
01:16:18.199 --> 01:16:19.263
She's safe.

1373
01:16:19.287 --> 01:16:20.003
A friend is watching her.

1374
01:16:20.027 --> 01:16:23.485
Safe. For how long?

1375
01:16:23.509 --> 01:16:26.706
What's in the bag, Sarah?

1376
01:16:26.730 --> 01:16:28.055
You know who I am?

1377
01:16:28.079 --> 01:16:30.449
Well, I know who you are, too, Mr.
Sturup.


1378
01:16:30.473 --> 01:16:33.365
That surveillance system,
pretty good set-up.


1379
01:16:33.389 --> 01:16:34.714
State of the art.

1380
01:16:34.738 --> 01:16:36.392
Open the bag.

1381
01:16:46.750 --> 01:16:50.730
Ah, my past life.

1382
01:16:50.754 --> 01:16:52.427
It feels good to come clean.

1383
01:16:52.451 --> 01:16:53.907
You should try it.

1384
01:16:53.931 --> 01:16:55.735
Why are you doing this to us?

1385
01:16:55.759 --> 01:16:57.040
Did Victoria hire you?

1386
01:16:57.064 --> 01:16:58.564
The ex-wife?

1387
01:16:58.588 --> 01:16:59.826
No, Mr. Miller.

1388
01:16:59.850 --> 01:17:00.479
She doesn't have
anything to do with it.


1389
01:17:00.503 --> 01:17:01.305
Where's Julie?

1390
01:17:01.329 --> 01:17:02.524
What did you do with her?

1391
01:17:02.548 --> 01:17:03.482
Who?

1392
01:17:03.506 --> 01:17:04.700
Julie?

1393
01:17:04.724 --> 01:17:05.309
Oh, thank god!

1394
01:17:05.333 --> 01:17:06.683
There you are!

1395
01:17:51.902 --> 01:17:53.270
Jennifer Serols.

1396
01:17:53.294 --> 01:17:55.185
Your daughter, I know.

1397
01:17:55.209 --> 01:17:56.839
You killed her like you killed
all the others you monster!


1398
01:17:56.863 --> 01:17:57.884
Get off my wife!

1399
01:17:57.908 --> 01:18:00.147
Wait, let me explain.

1400
01:18:00.171 --> 01:18:00.887
Let me explain.

1401
01:18:00.911 --> 01:18:01.912
You don't know...

1402
01:18:09.746 --> 01:18:11.550
You did it, you stopped him!

1403
01:18:11.574 --> 01:18:12.899
Yes, with your help.

1404
01:18:12.923 --> 01:18:14.763
There's another gun over
there under the couch.


1405
01:18:14.787 --> 01:18:16.006
Go, I'll watch him.

1406
01:18:19.582 --> 01:18:21.453
Pathetic.

1407
01:18:24.064 --> 01:18:25.564
Oh my god!

1408
01:18:25.588 --> 01:18:28.088
Julie.

1409
01:18:28.112 --> 01:18:29.655
What are you doing here?

1410
01:18:29.679 --> 01:18:30.767
What are you doing here?

1411
01:18:40.907 --> 01:18:45.584
I think now we call the cops!

1412
01:18:45.608 --> 01:18:47.107
Not quite yet.

1413
01:18:47.131 --> 01:18:48.282
Watch out!

1414
01:18:48.306 --> 01:18:49.979
Ahhhhh!!!!

1415
01:18:50.003 --> 01:18:51.222
Kurt!

1416
01:18:59.926 --> 01:19:01.687
Sarah?

1417
01:19:01.711 --> 01:19:04.124
Well, this was going
to happen inevitably.


1418
01:19:04.148 --> 01:19:07.388
However unfortunate the
covers are always discovered.


1419
01:19:07.412 --> 01:19:09.521
I told you to stay away, honey.

1420
01:19:09.545 --> 01:19:10.434
I don't understand.

1421
01:19:10.458 --> 01:19:12.872
Your wife is a killer.

1422
01:19:12.896 --> 01:19:15.439
She murdered my daughter.

1423
01:19:15.463 --> 01:19:17.790
That was your fault, not mine.

1424
01:19:17.814 --> 01:19:20.619
You were getting too close
with your investigation.


1425
01:19:20.643 --> 01:19:22.577
Why her?

1426
01:19:22.601 --> 01:19:24.971
Why not me?

1427
01:19:24.995 --> 01:19:27.626
Because killing a cop
makes matters worse.


1428
01:19:27.650 --> 01:19:31.804
Killing his daughter
makes it personal,


1429
01:19:31.828 --> 01:19:33.501
therefore removing
you from the case.


1430
01:19:33.525 --> 01:19:35.982
It's police procedure,
Vincent, you know that!


1431
01:19:36.006 --> 01:19:37.592
Hey!

1432
01:19:37.616 --> 01:19:39.159
Sit down!

1433
01:19:39.183 --> 01:19:42.684
Sit down!

1434
01:19:42.708 --> 01:19:48.603
You killed everyone
in those photographs?


1435
01:19:48.627 --> 01:19:49.430
They were assignments.

1436
01:19:49.454 --> 01:19:51.127
It wasn't personal.

1437
01:19:51.151 --> 01:19:52.738
I'm a pro.

1438
01:19:52.762 --> 01:19:57.003
Your job in the
city, our family.


1439
01:19:57.027 --> 01:20:00.789
That was my cover.

1440
01:20:00.813 --> 01:20:02.748
One's got to keep a low
profile in this business.


1441
01:20:02.772 --> 01:20:04.812
Who's going to suspect a
married woman with a child?


1442
01:20:04.836 --> 01:20:05.596
You certainly didn't.

1443
01:20:05.620 --> 01:20:07.056
Put that on.

1444
01:20:07.080 --> 01:20:08.841
Who are you?

1445
01:20:08.865 --> 01:20:11.041
Ah, ah, ah Mr. Officer.

1446
01:20:28.711 --> 01:20:30.340
How did you find me?

1447
01:20:30.364 --> 01:20:32.560
Mathieu, I imagine.

1448
01:20:32.584 --> 01:20:34.693
You're right.

1449
01:20:34.717 --> 01:20:37.957
After Jenny's death they
took me off the case.


1450
01:20:37.981 --> 01:20:39.611
I quit the force.

1451
01:20:39.635 --> 01:20:41.830
I've been looking
for you ever since.


1452
01:20:41.854 --> 01:20:42.962
You okay?

1453
01:20:42.986 --> 01:20:45.355
Hey! Don't move!

1454
01:20:45.379 --> 01:20:46.748
Ok.

1455
01:20:46.772 --> 01:20:51.448
You know, Mathieu called
me a few days ago.


1456
01:20:51.472 --> 01:20:53.189
Hired me to take you out.

1457
01:20:53.213 --> 01:20:54.626
Of course I know.

1458
01:20:54.650 --> 01:20:56.889
I ordered the hit.

1459
01:20:56.913 --> 01:20:58.107
On yourself?

1460
01:20:58.131 --> 01:20:59.587
After I tapped his phones

1461
01:20:59.611 --> 01:21:02.721
I knew he'd reach out to
his number one employee.


1462
01:21:02.745 --> 01:21:05.549
That's how I located this house.

1463
01:21:05.573 --> 01:21:09.249
I just didn't know which
one of you was the killer.


1464
01:21:09.273 --> 01:21:15.777
You triangulated my location
using my private cell?


1465
01:21:15.801 --> 01:21:18.998
That's smart.

1466
01:21:19.022 --> 01:21:20.434
You didn't come for me.

1467
01:21:20.458 --> 01:21:22.338
Well, you kept me pretty
busy the last few days,


1468
01:21:22.362 --> 01:21:23.132
didn't you, honey?

1469
01:21:23.156 --> 01:21:26.135
Wait, what private cell?

1470
01:21:26.159 --> 01:21:28.988
There was a reason I didn't want
your little brat in my closet.


1471
01:21:41.697 --> 01:21:42.959
What is that?

1472
01:21:44.221 --> 01:21:46.590
What I was coming
to get when I found


1473
01:21:46.614 --> 01:21:50.333
Julie snooping
around here tonight.


1474
01:21:50.357 --> 01:21:52.596
Yeah, it's her private
line to Mathieu Diamond.


1475
01:21:52.620 --> 01:21:54.642
No, it's a secure line to me.

1476
01:21:54.666 --> 01:21:57.427
Calls come in,
they don't go out.


1477
01:21:57.451 --> 01:21:58.994
It's a safety
precaution Mathieu made


1478
01:21:59.018 --> 01:22:03.738
in case I was tracked down and
it couldn't get back to him.


1479
01:22:03.762 --> 01:22:05.042
But then I saw the news tonight,

1480
01:22:05.066 --> 01:22:07.611
apparently your boys
found another way.


1481
01:22:07.635 --> 01:22:09.657
Hey, it's me.

1482
01:22:09.681 --> 01:22:11.761
I've just discovered that
my office has been bugged.


1483
01:22:11.785 --> 01:22:13.400
The boys in blue are
watching me now


1484
01:22:13.424 --> 01:22:16.272
so all assignments are
on permanent hold.


1485
01:22:16.296 --> 01:22:18.927
It's not safe anymore.

1486
01:22:18.951 --> 01:22:22.583
You're on your own.

1487
01:22:22.607 --> 01:22:24.522
That I am.

1488
01:22:28.308 --> 01:22:31.331
Nice working with you, Mathieu.

1489
01:22:31.355 --> 01:22:33.463
What are you planning to do?

1490
01:22:33.487 --> 01:22:35.509
Time to move on.

1491
01:22:35.533 --> 01:22:39.121
Cover's been blown,
police are moving in,


1492
01:22:39.145 --> 01:22:42.211
escape plan is now in effect.

1493
01:22:42.235 --> 01:22:44.039
I was planning to not
survive the night.


1494
01:22:44.063 --> 01:22:46.152
Now I'm afraid
neither of us can.


1495
01:22:49.242 --> 01:22:51.462
I mentioned I had to
stop off for gas.


1496
01:22:55.771 --> 01:22:59.794
I imagine tomorrow's headline
will read something like


1497
01:22:59.818 --> 01:23:04.625
"poor, aspiring novelist Kurt
Miller and his wife Sarah"


1498
01:23:04.649 --> 01:23:08.411
were found murdered in
their suburban home


1499
01:23:08.435 --> 01:23:10.283
late last night,

1500
01:23:10.307 --> 01:23:15.244
victims of ex-police
officer Vincent Sturup


1501
01:23:15.268 --> 01:23:18.552
who, in a psychotic fit of rage,

1502
01:23:18.576 --> 01:23:25.080
decided to take the law
into his own hands.


1503
01:23:25.104 --> 01:23:32.000
Then, in an attempt to
conceal his actions,


1504
01:23:32.024 --> 01:23:40.024
"he started a fire that
consumed himself as well."


1505
01:23:40.816 --> 01:23:43.055
I think it's brilliant.

1506
01:23:43.079 --> 01:23:46.319
I mean, really, it's
pretty close to the truth.


1507
01:23:46.343 --> 01:23:48.843
Except Sarah Miller the deceased

1508
01:23:48.867 --> 01:23:53.979
will be played by the
newcomer, Julie Kriegel.


1509
01:23:54.003 --> 01:23:55.676
Yeah.

1510
01:23:55.700 --> 01:23:58.635
By the time they discover
they're your burned remains,


1511
01:23:58.659 --> 01:24:03.902
I'll be far away from here,
a new car, a new life,


1512
01:24:03.926 --> 01:24:06.102
a new identity.

1513
01:24:17.417 --> 01:24:19.178
Nice try, honey.

1514
01:24:19.202 --> 01:24:21.354
I understand, I know
you're upset ok?


1515
01:24:21.378 --> 01:24:23.922
I promise to kill
you last, alright?


1516
01:24:23.946 --> 01:24:26.818
Argh!!!

1517
01:24:53.889 --> 01:24:56.065
Time to finish this.

1518
01:25:03.115 --> 01:25:08.357
Honey, what're you doing?

1519
01:25:08.381 --> 01:25:12.013
You're not going to kill me.

1520
01:25:12.037 --> 01:25:16.844
Kurt, you love me, right?

1521
01:25:16.868 --> 01:25:18.174
Loved.

1522
01:25:19.784 --> 01:25:21.980
Past tense.

1523
01:25:22.004 --> 01:25:25.940
You know it's not so
easy to murder someone.


1524
01:25:25.964 --> 01:25:27.884
It takes a certain type
of person to be a killer.


1525
01:25:32.101 --> 01:25:38.411
And you, sweetie, you
aren't that person.


1526
01:25:58.170 --> 01:25:59.606
Like I said, Mrs. Miller.

1527
01:26:02.174 --> 01:26:04.263
You're fired.

1528
01:26:27.373 --> 01:26:31.353
I feel like I should
thank you and apologize.


1529
01:26:31.377 --> 01:26:33.355
I don't really
want to do either.


1530
01:26:33.379 --> 01:26:37.272
I feel the same way, so why
don't we just leave it at that?


1531
01:26:37.296 --> 01:26:38.994
Take care of that little girl.

1532
01:26:49.068 --> 01:26:50.068
How are you?

1533
01:26:50.092 --> 01:26:52.505
I'll be fine.

1534
01:26:52.529 --> 01:26:54.768
I don't know what to say.

1535
01:26:54.792 --> 01:26:56.639
You saved my life.

1536
01:26:56.663 --> 01:26:58.902
You saved mine, first.

1537
01:26:58.926 --> 01:27:00.730
I guess that makes us even.

1538
01:27:00.754 --> 01:27:02.515
Although I am still
out of a job.


1539
01:27:02.539 --> 01:27:04.865
Well, all of this does give
me an idea for a new novel,


1540
01:27:04.889 --> 01:27:06.127
and I could use an assistant.

1541
01:27:06.151 --> 01:27:07.607
Really?

1542
01:27:07.631 --> 01:27:10.044
Someone with intimate
knowledge of the material.


1543
01:27:10.068 --> 01:27:11.524
How's your health plan?

1544
01:27:11.548 --> 01:27:13.332
It's improving by the minute.

1545
01:27:15.291 --> 01:27:17.225
Daddy!

1546
01:27:17.249 --> 01:27:19.575
Come here, come here,
come here, come here!!!!


1547
01:27:19.599 --> 01:27:20.794
Oh, ho, ho...

1548
01:27:20.818 --> 01:27:21.882
My one and only love.

1549
01:27:21.906 --> 01:27:23.734
Hi, baby.
