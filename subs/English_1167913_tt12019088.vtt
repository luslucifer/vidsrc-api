1
00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:08.923
The girl,

2
00:00:09.056 --> 00:00:11.424
they ended up--
they never did find her body,


3
00:00:11.591 --> 00:00:13.693
but evidently they kept her--

4
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.130
she kept her somewhere
in a pen like this.


5
00:00:16.264 --> 00:00:19.233
<i>In 2007, Caleb Jones</i>
<i>and his wife, Rachel,</i>


6
00:00:19.367 --> 00:00:22.569
<i>saw an ad near the Weimer store</i>
<i>about help needing cutting</i>
<i>wood.</i>


7
00:00:22.736 --> 00:00:25.172
<i>On the other end of that ad,</i>
<i>Susan Worley.</i>


8
00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:26.506
Just up the hill right here,

9
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.042
that's where they found
one of the--


10
00:00:28.209 --> 00:00:29.643
like, an arm or a leg
or something,


11
00:00:29.809 --> 00:00:31.245
just right over the hill there.

12
00:00:31.379 --> 00:00:33.114
And if you look, the barn there,

13
00:00:33.247 --> 00:00:34.748
it's torn down now.

14
00:00:34.916 --> 00:00:36.483
<i>Jones says</i>
<i>he and his wife eventually</i>


15
00:00:36.616 --> 00:00:38.352
<i>lived on her property.</i>

16
00:00:38.518 --> 00:00:39.954
<i>They set up a small trailer</i>

17
00:00:40.121 --> 00:00:42.123
<i>and helped her clean up</i>
<i>the property and feed her pigs.</i>


18
00:00:42.256 --> 00:00:45.525
<i>And all of the sudden,</i>
<i>Worley told them they had to</i>
<i>go.</i>


19
00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:47.194
He turned white as a ghost.

20
00:00:47.328 --> 00:00:49.163
I mean, you can see I'm getting
chill bumps right now


21
00:00:49.297 --> 00:00:51.065
just thinking about it,
because it's, like,


22
00:00:51.198 --> 00:00:54.834
whenever you're that close
to somebody to escape death.


23
00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:56.736
<i>Both of them</i>
<i>remember her living conditions</i>


24
00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.306
<i>as being terrible.</i>

25
00:00:58.471 --> 00:00:59.941
<i>While there was running water</i>
<i>on the property,</i>


26
00:01:00.074 --> 00:01:02.709
<i>both say</i>
<i>there was no bathroom on site.</i>


27
00:01:03.177 --> 00:01:05.179
Her living conditions
were-- were crazy,


28
00:01:05.313 --> 00:01:07.647
because she let the pigs
live in the house


29
00:01:07.814 --> 00:01:09.549
and they would run through
and come and go


30
00:01:09.683 --> 00:01:11.285
as she pleased as...

31
00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.889
But there-- there was just
something about her


32
00:01:15.022 --> 00:01:17.557
that was off,
that just was eerie.


33
00:01:17.691 --> 00:01:20.627
<i>And they say news</i>
<i>of her arrest comes as a shock.</i>


34
00:01:20.794 --> 00:01:22.629
There were
warning signs definitely.


35
00:01:22.997 --> 00:01:25.132
She-- she was always nice to me.

36
00:01:25.598 --> 00:01:29.170
I remember down at the shelter,
I was looking for work...


37
00:01:49.223 --> 00:01:50.623
Come on, you're almost there.

38
00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.093
Right there.

39
00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.560
Push.

40
00:01:53.693 --> 00:01:57.131
Push.

41
00:02:11.145 --> 00:02:13.280
Come on.

42
00:02:13.414 --> 00:02:15.483
Push. Come on.

43
00:03:06.766 --> 00:03:08.402
No!

44
00:03:43.603 --> 00:03:44.737
-With you.
-Yeah.


45
00:03:44.871 --> 00:03:46.140
What else do we need?

46
00:03:46.273 --> 00:03:47.841
Like, did the boys
prepare for anything?


47
00:03:47.975 --> 00:03:49.676
Yeah, prepare, like, bring beer.

48
00:03:50.077 --> 00:03:52.413
-This number keeps texting here.
-Oh, my God, it's 818.


49
00:03:52.546 --> 00:03:53.713
That's, like, Burbank.

50
00:03:53.881 --> 00:03:56.016
-Ew, who lives there?
-Oh, my God.


51
00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:58.385
-Jesus!
-Looking good, ladies.


52
00:03:58.552 --> 00:03:59.920
-Looking good.
-Oh!


53
00:04:00.054 --> 00:04:01.721
So my jiu-jitsu
classes are paying off.


54
00:04:01.855 --> 00:04:03.290
-Girl, yes.
-Hey, baby girl!


55
00:04:03.457 --> 00:04:05.625
-Looking marvelous as always.
-Thank you.


56
00:04:05.792 --> 00:04:07.794
And hey, cutie!
I forget your name.


57
00:04:07.962 --> 00:04:10.630
-I smoke too much weed.
-Hurricane.


58
00:04:10.797 --> 00:04:13.067
-Don't ask why.
-Yeah, don't.


59
00:04:13.234 --> 00:04:15.102
Girl, you're walking a pit bull
on the streets of Hillcrest.


60
00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:17.104
I'm surprised
a Karen hasn't got you yet.


61
00:04:17.837 --> 00:04:21.774
First of all, I am Black, gay,
and I need emotional support.


62
00:04:21.942 --> 00:04:23.743
And, girl,
you know we're in California.


63
00:04:23.911 --> 00:04:25.678
Why you got all that on
like you a Eskimo?


64
00:04:25.845 --> 00:04:27.014
Oh, I'm Mormon now.

65
00:04:27.181 --> 00:04:29.583
-Is that sheep's wool?
-Uh, yeah.


66
00:04:29.716 --> 00:04:31.185
Mormon.

67
00:04:31.318 --> 00:04:33.254
Girl, ain't no church gonna
have your scraggly ass.


68
00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:38.292
So, we're going to
my boyfriend's dad's house


69
00:04:38.459 --> 00:04:39.960
in Oregon,
he's got a cabin up there.


70
00:04:40.094 --> 00:04:41.962
We're gonna have
a little weekend fiesta.


71
00:04:42.096 --> 00:04:43.964
Adrianna, meet my friends.

72
00:04:44.131 --> 00:04:46.634
Marcus, Tyler, and the star
of the show, Hurricane.


73
00:04:46.799 --> 00:04:48.735
Oh, my God, so cute.

74
00:04:48.903 --> 00:04:50.905
Wait, why is his name Hurricane?

75
00:04:51.472 --> 00:04:52.940
Don't ask.

76
00:06:02.943 --> 00:06:07.014
Please, please, please.

77
00:07:29.129 --> 00:07:31.198
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

78
00:08:02.162 --> 00:08:04.398
Um, you guys should come
to the cabin with us, right?


79
00:08:04.531 --> 00:08:05.799
Yes, yes!

80
00:08:05.966 --> 00:08:07.935
I'm a city slicker.
This ass don't walk in grass.


81
00:08:08.102 --> 00:08:09.403
And these heels don't, either.

82
00:08:09.536 --> 00:08:11.972
Well, I know Hurricane
would like to get out


83
00:08:12.106 --> 00:08:13.807
-of the city for a weekend.
-Yeah.


84
00:08:13.941 --> 00:08:15.109
Come on, do it for the dog.

85
00:08:15.275 --> 00:08:16.777
Babe, I've been to Oregon.

86
00:08:16.944 --> 00:08:19.446
And there's no place for
my beautiful, sexy Black ass.


87
00:08:21.281 --> 00:08:23.484
Burning daylight, let's roll.

88
00:08:25.753 --> 00:08:27.187
How was it, buddy?

89
00:08:29.189 --> 00:08:30.557
There's a pandemic coming.

90
00:09:40.994 --> 00:09:42.963
What is wrong with you?

91
00:09:45.065 --> 00:09:46.667
Why are you doing this?

92
00:09:47.234 --> 00:09:48.602
Why are you doing this?

93
00:09:48.735 --> 00:09:50.170
I have a baby!

94
00:09:50.304 --> 00:09:51.839
Please, just leave me alone!

95
00:09:52.005 --> 00:09:53.373
Don't kill me, please.

96
00:09:53.507 --> 00:09:56.977
I'll do anything you want,
please.


97
00:09:58.178 --> 00:10:00.481
Say something!
What are you doing?


98
00:11:51.725 --> 00:11:53.560
That must be
your prince charming.


99
00:11:53.727 --> 00:11:56.630
-Mm-hmm.
-Well, Merry Christmas.


100
00:11:57.065 --> 00:11:58.900
I hope I see you guys soon.

101
00:11:59.299 --> 00:12:00.567
Please someone save me

102
00:12:00.734 --> 00:12:03.136
from these cannibals
and meat eaters.


103
00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:05.138
Girl, you don't eat meat?
I eat meat.


104
00:12:05.772 --> 00:12:08.842
Well, I don't swallow,
but don't tell anyone.


105
00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:10.611
Bye!

106
00:12:14.082 --> 00:12:15.282
Love her.

107
00:12:15.415 --> 00:12:17.718
But speaking of secrets,
does he know yet?


108
00:12:17.851 --> 00:12:19.553
No, and I'd like
to keep it that way.


109
00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:22.289
I haven't decided
if I'm keeping it or not.


110
00:12:22.422 --> 00:12:24.291
You've got to
protect yourself, woman!


111
00:12:24.791 --> 00:12:26.193
Funny you should say that,
Tyler.


112
00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:28.395
-I always say that to you.
-Whatever.


113
00:12:28.528 --> 00:12:31.698
Okay, just text me
if you change your mind, okay?


114
00:12:31.832 --> 00:12:34.601
Love you, love you.

115
00:12:34.735 --> 00:12:36.336
Bye, Hurricane.

116
00:12:40.273 --> 00:12:41.708
Girl, I love her,

117
00:12:41.875 --> 00:12:44.344
but she is crazy if she has
a baby with that mess.


118
00:12:56.390 --> 00:12:58.492
-Who the fuck was that?
-Just some friends.


119
00:12:58.659 --> 00:13:01.561
I was trying
to get them to come up.


120
00:13:01.695 --> 00:13:04.398
You can't just invite people
to my parents' cabin


121
00:13:04.531 --> 00:13:06.134
without asking me first.

122
00:13:07.567 --> 00:13:09.736
Uh, you're such a butt plug.

123
00:13:10.637 --> 00:13:12.372
What the fuck
does that supposed to mean?


124
00:13:12.739 --> 00:13:14.841
Butt plug? Who has a butt plug?

125
00:13:15.009 --> 00:13:16.710
Of course that's all
you got from that statement.


126
00:13:16.877 --> 00:13:18.946
Jesus, guys, we haven't even
made it down the road


127
00:13:19.113 --> 00:13:20.347
and you're already fighting.

128
00:13:21.015 --> 00:13:23.383
All right, all right,
all right, you're right.


129
00:13:23.517 --> 00:13:24.886
Ladies and gentlemen,
I apologize.


130
00:13:25.019 --> 00:13:27.821
I have a chronic disorder
of douchebag,


131
00:13:27.989 --> 00:13:29.189
but have no fear.

132
00:13:29.723 --> 00:13:31.926
I will protect you
and I am strapped.


133
00:13:33.293 --> 00:13:34.494
Strap on?

134
00:13:35.063 --> 00:13:37.497
Well, I knew he was a perv,
but not you, Brit.


135
00:13:37.631 --> 00:13:41.102
Oh, that shows
how little you know about me.


136
00:13:41.234 --> 00:13:42.536
I know what you meant,
tough guy.


137
00:13:42.669 --> 00:13:45.272
You want that. 45,
that Jesus piece.


138
00:13:47.541 --> 00:13:52.612

Wait, wait, you have a gun?

142
00:13:59.987 --> 00:14:03.124
Well, I mean,
I prefer a peacemaker, a heater.


143
00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:05.358
That's so unnecessary.

144
00:14:07.761 --> 00:14:10.031
Unnecessary
until it's necessary.


145
00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:12.532
So
what are you scared of, cowboy?


146
00:14:13.734 --> 00:14:16.971
I don't know, you know,
vegans scare the hell out of me.


147
00:14:17.105 --> 00:14:19.907
Well, you should be scared.

148
00:14:20.041 --> 00:14:21.641
Listen, Adrianna,
I know you hate me,


149
00:14:21.808 --> 00:14:23.677
but no matter what happens...

150
00:14:24.311 --> 00:14:25.479
I'm gonna protect you.

151
00:14:25.612 --> 00:14:27.148
Not because
I care about justice,


152
00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:28.548
I just want to use my gun.

153
00:14:28.916 --> 00:14:30.350
Oh, is this the part
where you tell us


154
00:14:30.484 --> 00:14:32.285
about
your Second Amendment rights?


155
00:14:32.652 --> 00:14:34.588
Aren't you scared
of getting arrested?


156
00:14:34.956 --> 00:14:36.456
They have something
called licensing,


157
00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:38.126
so if you have a gun license

158
00:14:38.291 --> 00:14:39.659
and you're not with the liberal,

159
00:14:39.793 --> 00:14:42.395
we should be good
according to law.


160
00:14:42.964 --> 00:14:45.565
Brittany, you must be
a saint to be with this one.


161
00:14:45.732 --> 00:14:47.567
I'm sorry,
I didn't hear anything.


162
00:14:47.734 --> 00:14:49.170
That's gonna be
my number one tip


163
00:14:49.302 --> 00:14:50.972
when I become a dating guru.

164
00:14:51.404 --> 00:14:53.540
Using the excuse
of being on your phone.


165
00:14:53.673 --> 00:14:55.275
Sounds like great advice.

166
00:14:55.709 --> 00:14:57.744
Well, I'll be
your first patient, Brit.


167
00:14:57.912 --> 00:14:59.981
Just make sure
to give me a good prescription.


168
00:15:00.114 --> 00:15:01.615
Do I hear two?

169
00:15:02.016 --> 00:15:03.316
I second the notion.

170
00:15:03.450 --> 00:15:05.219
Dibs on <i>uno.</i>

171
00:15:05.352 --> 00:15:07.088
Bullying and skipping line.

172
00:15:07.221 --> 00:15:08.755
Why am I not surprised?

173
00:15:09.389 --> 00:15:11.125
Anyway, let's be friends.

174
00:15:11.291 --> 00:15:13.727
I don't wanna get shot.

175
00:15:14.162 --> 00:15:15.595
Shake on it?

176
00:15:20.034 --> 00:15:21.301
Let's get fucked up.

177
00:15:23.336 --> 00:15:25.438
Here we go! Rock and roll!

178
00:16:24.364 --> 00:16:26.666
Morning, Susan.
Sorry to bother you.


179
00:16:26.833 --> 00:16:29.369
I know it's early, but we got
a few questions for you.


180
00:16:29.536 --> 00:16:31.172
Neighbors complaining?

181
00:16:31.305 --> 00:16:32.639
Not this time.

182
00:16:32.806 --> 00:16:34.441
Uh, we're just interested
to know the last time


183
00:16:34.574 --> 00:16:36.110
you saw Doug Birchfield.

184
00:16:37.777 --> 00:16:40.281
Yeah,
Dougie used to work for me.


185
00:16:40.413 --> 00:16:41.681
Like all of 'em.

186
00:16:42.149 --> 00:16:44.718
Made some money,
got hooked back on the needle.


187
00:16:45.152 --> 00:16:47.721
Were you and Mr. Birchfield
ever romantically involved?


188
00:16:48.421 --> 00:16:52.260
'Course not.
I ain't needed a man in years.


189
00:16:52.425 --> 00:16:53.995
Especially not a junkie.

190
00:16:54.861 --> 00:16:56.763
I'm starting to feel
like you're up to something...


191
00:16:57.265 --> 00:16:59.200
and I don't think
I like it very much.


192
00:16:59.333 --> 00:17:01.102
How many pigs you got, Susan?

193
00:17:01.701 --> 00:17:03.137
Besides
the two on the porch...


194
00:17:04.038 --> 00:17:05.839
30, 40.

195
00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:08.575
Pig's a very
resourceful creature.


196
00:17:08.742 --> 00:17:11.045
-Hm.
-A lot you could do with a pig.


197
00:17:12.146 --> 00:17:13.647
Yeah.

198
00:17:13.813 --> 00:17:15.782
Your dad was a pig farmer,
wasn't he, Officer Raymond?


199
00:17:17.484 --> 00:17:18.920
He was.

200
00:17:20.620 --> 00:17:23.057
Well, you have yourself
a great day, Susan.


201
00:17:33.334 --> 00:17:34.834
You think she did it?

202
00:17:35.002 --> 00:17:37.504
Well, she's already lying
about their relationship.


203
00:17:38.438 --> 00:17:41.541
And look at this place.

204
00:17:41.675 --> 00:17:44.811
She's got every means
to dispose of a body...


205
00:17:44.946 --> 00:17:46.713
including a homeless person.

206
00:17:51.319 --> 00:17:52.987
Easy write off.

207
00:17:57.358 --> 00:17:58.792
Don't do it.

208
00:17:59.693 --> 00:18:01.494
We need probable cause.

209
00:18:03.197 --> 00:18:04.631
But we'll get it.

210
00:18:23.184 --> 00:18:24.885
Bro,
we should have a pig roast.


211
00:18:25.019 --> 00:18:28.255
Uh, you better fucking not.

212
00:18:28.389 --> 00:18:29.856
I'm down, dude. Let's do it.

213
00:18:59.086 --> 00:19:00.754
Hey, I heard
you were the one to talk to


214
00:19:00.921 --> 00:19:02.289
about getting some work.

215
00:19:02.423 --> 00:19:04.458
I sure could use some money
if you got anything.


216
00:19:04.591 --> 00:19:06.227
Who told you that?

217
00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:08.828
I-- I don't remember, it's just
kind of the talk around here.


218
00:19:08.996 --> 00:19:11.265
I don't recognize you.
Where are you from?


219
00:19:11.432 --> 00:19:12.832
Uh, California.

220
00:19:17.471 --> 00:19:19.672
Can you keep a secret?

221
00:19:19.806 --> 00:19:21.708
Of course, you can trust me.

222
00:19:26.147 --> 00:19:27.580
I could hire you on my farm...

223
00:19:28.315 --> 00:19:30.284
but I don't like people
knowing my business.


224
00:19:30.683 --> 00:19:33.454
Yes, ma'am, I understand.

225
00:19:33.586 --> 00:19:35.022
Appreciate it, Susan.

226
00:19:37.091 --> 00:19:39.859
-You can't trust these people.
-I-- I give you my word--


227
00:19:39.994 --> 00:19:41.628
If you're gonna work for me,

228
00:19:41.795 --> 00:19:43.431
I gotta know I can trust you.

229
00:19:43.931 --> 00:19:46.833
I-- I give you my word,
I'll keep it between you and me.


230
00:19:48.469 --> 00:19:49.803
Come by my place in the morning.

231
00:19:49.937 --> 00:19:51.372
Oh, thank you so much.

232
00:19:51.505 --> 00:19:53.740
-I won't let you down.
-Hm.


233
00:19:55.142 --> 00:19:56.576
It'll be good.

234
00:19:57.710 --> 00:19:59.246
You won't regret it.

235
00:20:00.014 --> 00:20:01.248
Thanks!

236
00:20:01.714 --> 00:20:03.384
Nice talking to you.

237
00:20:03.517 --> 00:20:05.052
I won't let you down!

238
00:20:34.482 --> 00:20:35.682
Uh, all right, gang.

239
00:20:35.849 --> 00:20:36.984
I need a drink, let's stop here

240
00:20:37.151 --> 00:20:38.818
at the local Watering Hole.

241
00:20:38.953 --> 00:20:40.854
- What do you say?
- I'm game.


242
00:20:41.188 --> 00:20:43.157
I need to stop by the
store and get some booze, too.


243
00:20:43.290 --> 00:20:46.793
- All in favor say aye.
- Aye!


244
00:20:59.772 --> 00:21:01.075
Got you a drink already, babe.

245
00:21:01.208 --> 00:21:02.943
Well, I wanted to
change it up a bit.


246
00:21:03.077 --> 00:21:04.644
-Get something different.
-Oh.


247
00:21:04.777 --> 00:21:06.981
So what's the plan, Captain?

248
00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:11.018
Uh, the plan is no plan,
Corporal.


249
00:21:12.086 --> 00:21:14.854
I definitely want to do
some lounging around.


250
00:21:14.989 --> 00:21:17.258
Get caught up on my beauty rest.

251
00:21:17.690 --> 00:21:19.260
How about you boys?

252
00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:22.363
I'd like to do some manly stuff.

253
00:21:22.496 --> 00:21:24.632
Maybe teach a boy here
how to drive stick.


254
00:21:26.866 --> 00:21:28.903
What does being a man even mean?

255
00:21:29.036 --> 00:21:30.971
Bartender,
another round, please.


256
00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:35.775
What? They work for me.

257
00:21:36.477 --> 00:21:37.677
No, seriously.

258
00:21:37.810 --> 00:21:40.014
What does
being a man consist of?


259
00:21:40.481 --> 00:21:42.049
Oh, I think I would know.

260
00:21:42.216 --> 00:21:43.884
Yeah, it's probably
eating a lot of meat,


261
00:21:44.018 --> 00:21:45.953
so your asshole just lights up.

262
00:21:46.086 --> 00:21:48.122
What is
with you two and buttholes?


263
00:21:48.255 --> 00:21:50.658
I am the rubber band man

264
00:21:50.823 --> 00:21:52.126
for tonight.

265
00:21:52.259 --> 00:21:53.961
-Tony Tone!
-I got drinks.


266
00:21:54.128 --> 00:21:55.563
But I need that, actually.

267
00:21:55.996 --> 00:21:57.431
Ooh, baller!

268
00:21:57.565 --> 00:22:00.100
Yeah, let's-- let's kill it
while we're here, huh?


269
00:22:00.234 --> 00:22:01.468
Cheers.

270
00:22:04.004 --> 00:22:05.439
All right.

271
00:22:07.641 --> 00:22:09.842
So, what's your plan
after school, Brit?


272
00:22:10.010 --> 00:22:12.779
The plan is no plan.
How about you?


273
00:22:12.947 --> 00:22:15.382
I plan on starting
my own practice.


274
00:22:15.516 --> 00:22:17.717
That's if I ever finish.

275
00:22:18.552 --> 00:22:21.222
I don't know, maybe I'll just
be a professional student.


276
00:22:21.889 --> 00:22:23.624
No, you got this,
you're almost there.


277
00:22:23.756 --> 00:22:25.059
How about you, Hunter?

278
00:22:25.226 --> 00:22:26.793
What's in store for the marine?

279
00:22:26.961 --> 00:22:29.430
I was always
a little too cool for school.


280
00:22:29.563 --> 00:22:30.830
That's why I enlisted.

281
00:22:31.532 --> 00:22:34.867
But I don't know, I would like
to start a family one day.


282
00:22:35.035 --> 00:22:37.471
Oh, that's so cute.
A little baby Hunter.


283
00:22:37.638 --> 00:22:39.406
Baby Hunter.

284
00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:41.275
Tony!

285
00:22:43.010 --> 00:22:44.545
Party foul!

286
00:22:45.079 --> 00:22:47.747
No worries, Tony,
I didn't need one anyways.


287
00:22:51.919 --> 00:22:53.988
-Sorry.
-Were you a server?


288
00:22:54.787 --> 00:22:57.358
You're so cute
when you're embarrassed.


289
00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:01.161
Fucking thing!

290
00:23:02.096 --> 00:23:03.697
I'm ready
to leave after this round.


291
00:23:03.863 --> 00:23:05.165
Yes, please.

292
00:23:05.832 --> 00:23:08.302
We just got started,
what do you want to do, Tony?


293
00:23:09.069 --> 00:23:10.537
I think I want
the whole outdoor experience.


294
00:23:10.704 --> 00:23:12.273
Not this "watering hole" shit.

295
00:23:12.606 --> 00:23:15.476
We've been on the road all day,
I'm ready to chill.


296
00:23:16.043 --> 00:23:18.811
All right, ladies.
One more, then we go.


297
00:23:18.979 --> 00:23:21.814
-All right, cheers.
<i>-Prost.</i>


298
00:23:23.484 --> 00:23:25.753
- Party pooping tonight.
- What is this then?


299
00:23:25.919 --> 00:23:28.155
This is a drink.

300
00:23:28.289 --> 00:23:29.723
Too bad
you're not drinking with us.


301
00:23:29.890 --> 00:23:32.293
-What's up with that?
-What do you think this is?


302
00:23:33.527 --> 00:23:34.895
So can we leave?

303
00:23:35.029 --> 00:23:37.031
Sure, I guess.

304
00:24:13.033 --> 00:24:15.536
All right, guys,
here we are.


305
00:24:20.808 --> 00:24:22.109
The door was open.

306
00:24:22.276 --> 00:24:24.478
This place is a pigsty.

307
00:24:24.645 --> 00:24:27.047
See, this is why
I'm not nice to people.


308
00:24:27.181 --> 00:24:29.350
Look, maybe your water broke
or something.


309
00:24:32.086 --> 00:24:34.388
Kind of creepy, but whatever.

310
00:24:34.521 --> 00:24:36.156
-Let's get settled in.
-Adrianna, I think


311
00:24:36.290 --> 00:24:38.192
we have cucumbers if you want to
put some of your eyelids.


312
00:24:38.359 --> 00:24:40.860
No, thanks,
I brought my own facial masks.


313
00:24:41.028 --> 00:24:43.197
And by the way,
we only have one room available,


314
00:24:43.330 --> 00:24:45.265
so me and Britt will sleep
on the air mattress.


315
00:24:45.399 --> 00:24:47.067
You two can have the room.

316
00:24:47.201 --> 00:24:48.969
What's wrong
with the other two rooms?


317
00:24:49.303 --> 00:24:50.537
One's my mom's art studio

318
00:24:50.704 --> 00:24:52.639
and the other has
a bunch of shit in it.


319
00:24:52.773 --> 00:24:53.941
What kind of shit?

320
00:24:54.074 --> 00:24:56.176
Dude, I don't know,
doomsday shit.


321
00:24:56.543 --> 00:24:58.345
Well, thanks, that's sweet.

322
00:24:58.479 --> 00:25:00.381
You're officially
off my shit list.


323
00:25:00.514 --> 00:25:02.216
Yes! My life is complete.

324
00:25:02.349 --> 00:25:04.218
How about them cucumbers?

325
00:25:04.351 --> 00:25:06.887
You're bad.

326
00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:28.776
Man, that is a cool shotgun.

327
00:25:29.143 --> 00:25:30.310
Yeah, that was my grandpa's,

328
00:25:30.444 --> 00:25:32.613
he used to take us
skeet shooting


329
00:25:32.746 --> 00:25:34.314
and bird hunting as a kid.

330
00:25:37.684 --> 00:25:41.021
Skeet shooting is kind of
like our family sport.


331
00:25:41.890 --> 00:25:44.893
1892 Damascus steel.

332
00:25:45.058 --> 00:25:47.528
12 gauge.

333
00:25:47.661 --> 00:25:48.662
She is pretty.

334
00:25:48.829 --> 00:25:50.297
Please tell me
you've shot skeet before.


335
00:25:50.431 --> 00:25:52.733
What, those little orange
puck-looking things?


336
00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:56.103
Technically they're called
clay pigeons, but whatever.


337
00:25:57.504 --> 00:25:58.639
Okay.

338
00:25:58.806 --> 00:26:01.442
Sweet with the skeet, bro.
Let's do it to it.


339
00:26:10.751 --> 00:26:12.052
Okay, babe,

340
00:26:12.186 --> 00:26:13.854
we're gonna go
play guns in the woods.


341
00:26:13.987 --> 00:26:15.489
Be careful, Hunter.

342
00:26:17.224 --> 00:26:19.660
-Don't shoot your eye out, kid.
-Will do.


343
00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:26.767
Hey, take care of my man,
<i>capisce?</i>


344
00:26:27.334 --> 00:26:28.502
<i>Capisce,</i>
when I'm done with your man,


345
00:26:28.669 --> 00:26:29.870
he'll be shaking it
with two hands.


346
00:26:31.638 --> 00:26:33.974
Saddle up, Tony.

347
00:26:34.107 --> 00:26:37.044
Famous last words,
"I'll be back."


348
00:27:15.048 --> 00:27:16.550
Yeah.

349
00:27:42.242 --> 00:27:44.411
Just a second.

350
00:27:44.545 --> 00:27:45.980
Coming.

351
00:27:49.583 --> 00:27:51.385
Uh, hey.

352
00:27:56.123 --> 00:27:57.190
Randy.

353
00:27:58.058 --> 00:28:01.228
Uh, you've done a lot
to help out around this month,


354
00:28:01.395 --> 00:28:02.829
so I was thinking, uh...

355
00:28:03.597 --> 00:28:05.866
you don't have to worry
about the rent on the RV.


356
00:28:06.333 --> 00:28:08.502
Oh, well, thank you.

357
00:28:08.635 --> 00:28:11.838
I'll-- I'll do the best
I can for you.


358
00:28:12.006 --> 00:28:14.408
I got supper ready
if you wanna come in.


359
00:28:15.709 --> 00:28:18.812
Uh, no, I got--
I got things to do, but,


360
00:28:18.947 --> 00:28:21.015
uh, I appreciate
all that you've done for me.


361
00:28:23.450 --> 00:28:26.888
Well, uh, I could do a lot more.

362
00:28:27.588 --> 00:28:29.656
You know, I couldn't help but
notice your little habit there.


363
00:28:29.823 --> 00:28:32.826
What with you speeding around
so much and all.


364
00:28:33.995 --> 00:28:35.562
So, uh...

365
00:28:36.830 --> 00:28:37.966
all right.

366
00:28:38.131 --> 00:28:39.399
I'll let you go, but, uh...

367
00:28:40.034 --> 00:28:44.538
just let me know and Mom'll
cook you up something real good.


368
00:28:44.973 --> 00:28:46.440
Real good.

369
00:28:50.477 --> 00:28:53.547
So, what do you have
against the Piglady?


370
00:28:53.915 --> 00:28:55.148
What do you mean?

371
00:28:55.816 --> 00:28:59.186
It just seems like
you're hell bent on busting her.


372
00:28:59.319 --> 00:29:00.754
Is it personal?

373
00:29:00.888 --> 00:29:02.122
I just don't like her.

374
00:29:02.255 --> 00:29:03.690
She's a thief.

375
00:29:08.228 --> 00:29:10.163
She stole one of my dad's pigs.

376
00:29:10.731 --> 00:29:13.067
I'm pretty sure
she poisoned my dog.


377
00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:14.635
Ouch.

378
00:29:15.869 --> 00:29:17.304
How long ago?

379
00:29:19.139 --> 00:29:20.607
I was just a kid.

380
00:29:22.376 --> 00:29:24.511
But you know
what really pisses me off...


381
00:29:25.278 --> 00:29:27.915
is that
she paints herself as this


382
00:29:28.082 --> 00:29:31.852
heroic philanthropist
down at the shelter.


383
00:29:31.986 --> 00:29:33.787
Whatever.

384
00:29:34.821 --> 00:29:36.289
I feel you.

385
00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:38.792
Let's bust this bitch.

386
00:29:42.295 --> 00:29:44.065
Well, it is Christmas time.

387
00:29:45.198 --> 00:29:48.602
Seems to be bodies disappear
this time every year.


388
00:29:51.672 --> 00:29:53.975
Do you really think
she's behind this?


389
00:29:54.108 --> 00:29:55.308
I mean...

390
00:29:56.010 --> 00:29:58.812
a little petty theft
is a long shot for murder.


391
00:29:59.713 --> 00:30:00.647
And besides,

392
00:30:01.181 --> 00:30:03.850
with all the trimmigrants
working in the pot fields,


393
00:30:04.217 --> 00:30:05.887
it may be hard to quantify.

394
00:30:07.187 --> 00:30:08.689
It's just a feeling.

395
00:30:14.929 --> 00:30:16.396
It's just a feeling.

396
00:30:25.305 --> 00:30:27.141
You know
how stubborn Adrianna can be.


397
00:30:27.274 --> 00:30:28.408
I don't know how you do it.

398
00:30:37.317 --> 00:30:38.886
What?

399
00:31:15.022 --> 00:31:16.456
Hunter.

400
00:31:19.093 --> 00:31:20.460
Thank you, Adrianna.

401
00:31:20.594 --> 00:31:23.630
It's no whiskey,
but it'll have to do.


402
00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:28.702
It's like rubbing alcohol.

403
00:31:28.835 --> 00:31:31.105
-No, I'm good.
-Ooh.


404
00:31:31.239 --> 00:31:32.940
So, how was shooting guns today,

405
00:31:33.107 --> 00:31:34.407
my little tough guy?

406
00:31:34.541 --> 00:31:36.944
It was awesome. Hey, Hunter.

407
00:31:37.611 --> 00:31:39.312
-Hunter!
-Are you deaf?


408
00:31:39.446 --> 00:31:41.381
I saw an axe
in the back of the shed.


409
00:31:41.848 --> 00:31:43.617
In the spirit of tradition...

410
00:31:44.886 --> 00:31:46.988
Christmas tree, anyone?

411
00:31:49.322 --> 00:31:51.858
Ooh, Hunter,
I think you were right.


412
00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:54.661
Kind of digging
my new manly man.


413
00:31:55.529 --> 00:31:57.397
Well,
who's getting laid tonight?


414
00:31:58.132 --> 00:31:59.566
Who's getting laid tonight?

415
00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:02.736
Or today?

416
00:32:02.904 --> 00:32:04.771
Oh! Hint-hint.

417
00:32:04.939 --> 00:32:07.041
That'll give me something
to look forward to, babe.


418
00:32:07.208 --> 00:32:08.943
But I need to chop a tree.

419
00:32:09.076 --> 00:32:10.978
Oh, we're not gonna do that.

420
00:32:11.145 --> 00:32:13.380
You gotta learn
how to chop wood first, boy.


421
00:32:13.513 --> 00:32:15.448
Oh, I see how it is.

422
00:32:15.582 --> 00:32:17.417
So, you don't want it...

423
00:32:18.085 --> 00:32:19.287
now?

424
00:32:20.955 --> 00:32:23.723
Oof. Oof, babe,

425
00:32:23.891 --> 00:32:26.294
sometimes you want
what you can't have.


426
00:32:27.828 --> 00:32:29.763
Well, it's fine.
We need girl time anyways.


427
00:32:30.630 --> 00:32:33.134
Yeah, it'll give us
a chance to talk about you.


428
00:32:33.767 --> 00:32:35.735
Go on, do your manly stuff.

429
00:32:36.369 --> 00:32:37.972
let's go.

430
00:32:38.371 --> 00:32:39.773
Let's grab our coats.

431
00:32:39.941 --> 00:32:41.641
First thing you need to know
about chopping wood,


432
00:32:41.808 --> 00:32:43.277
it's all positioning
on the handle.


433
00:32:43.410 --> 00:32:44.711
Be careful.

434
00:32:45.079 --> 00:32:48.415
Well, I need help
with your cooking skills.


435
00:32:48.548 --> 00:32:49.884
I'm gonna make dinner.

436
00:32:50.051 --> 00:32:52.352
Sure thing. My pleasure.

437
00:32:53.620 --> 00:32:55.022
What're we having, captain?

438
00:32:55.189 --> 00:32:57.191
I was thinking
something easy.


439
00:32:57.325 --> 00:32:58.725
Maybe spaghetti?

440
00:32:58.893 --> 00:33:00.594
They can have the meatballs
after you get your food.


441
00:33:00.727 --> 00:33:03.597
-Thanks, babe.
-Yeah.


442
00:33:03.730 --> 00:33:06.267
All right,
let's clean this up.


443
00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:08.401
I love that
they're getting along.


444
00:33:12.173 --> 00:33:16.576
Okay, so how can I help you
with my cooking expertise?


445
00:33:39.833 --> 00:33:41.534
Hey, uh, man, I, uh,

446
00:33:41.668 --> 00:33:43.737
I think
I'll take you up on your offer.


447
00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:48.976
You got me a little bit curious.

448
00:34:01.655 --> 00:34:03.090
You want a bump?

449
00:34:04.392 --> 00:34:06.526
Oh, wow, thanks.

450
00:36:06.813 --> 00:36:09.316
Hey, honey.
I'm not gonna hurt you.


451
00:36:10.017 --> 00:36:11.751
I just need you awake for this.

452
00:36:11.919 --> 00:36:13.853
Uh, how long have I been out?

453
00:36:15.322 --> 00:36:16.790
Not long.

454
00:36:21.095 --> 00:36:22.595
Hey, why am I--

455
00:36:22.729 --> 00:36:25.299
Hey, why am I tied to the bed?

456
00:36:25.799 --> 00:36:28.102
Hey, what in the hell?

457
00:36:28.269 --> 00:36:29.602
What in the fuck?

458
00:36:29.736 --> 00:36:31.671
Why am I tied to the bed?

459
00:36:32.073 --> 00:36:34.008
What in the fuck is going on?

460
00:36:34.141 --> 00:36:37.445
I want out of here!
Why am I tied to the bed?


461
00:36:37.610 --> 00:36:39.447
I've seen you looking at me.

462
00:36:39.579 --> 00:36:41.015
What the fuck?

463
00:36:57.465 --> 00:36:58.899
What--

464
00:37:42.309 --> 00:37:44.178
Are they smoking?

465
00:37:44.311 --> 00:37:47.814
Tony will take any opportunity
he gets to roll a joint.


466
00:37:47.982 --> 00:37:49.183
They're so silly.

467
00:37:49.316 --> 00:37:51.519
-What are they even doing?
-I have no idea.


468
00:37:52.052 --> 00:37:53.753
I'm gonna make a drink,
do you want one?


469
00:37:53.921 --> 00:37:55.356
Maybe in a minute.

470
00:37:55.755 --> 00:37:57.124
Guys are so strange.

471
00:37:57.258 --> 00:37:58.758
I mean,
how they go around roaring


472
00:37:58.926 --> 00:38:00.793
and beating their chest
over nothing.


473
00:38:00.928 --> 00:38:02.463
I mean, it's almost primal.

474
00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:05.665
Yeah, it's almost as if
they're subconsciously clinging


475
00:38:05.832 --> 00:38:07.935
to the last
of their masculinity.


476
00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:15.242
I mean,
I guess I shouldn't complain.


477
00:38:15.409 --> 00:38:17.877
At least there's some
manly men left in the world.


478
00:38:18.345 --> 00:38:20.915
It does seem
to be a dying species.


479
00:38:21.081 --> 00:38:24.251
I try and let him run free,
but at the end of the day,


480
00:38:24.418 --> 00:38:26.620
he's such a moron.

481
00:38:26.753 --> 00:38:28.389
They need us to keep them tame.

482
00:38:28.556 --> 00:38:30.558
Tony would be lost without me.

483
00:38:30.723 --> 00:38:33.127
Or maybe
we'd be lost without them.


484
00:38:35.396 --> 00:38:36.931
You wanna ask
your mommy for permission?


485
00:38:37.064 --> 00:38:38.499
- Come on, dude.
- Fuck you, dude.


486
00:38:38.632 --> 00:38:40.067
I got this.

487
00:38:42.336 --> 00:38:44.871
What? What is it now?

488
00:38:45.639 --> 00:38:47.341
Nothing, man.
As you are, as you are.


489
00:38:47.474 --> 00:38:49.210
You gonna keep doing this
every time that I swing?


490
00:38:49.343 --> 00:38:50.777
I'm happy
you're cutting it, man.


491
00:38:50.945 --> 00:38:52.812
-Oh, man. Come on.
-You're doing good.


492
00:38:53.547 --> 00:38:54.847
What, are you cold, pretty boy?

493
00:39:00.054 --> 00:39:01.388
How does that feel?

494
00:39:01.522 --> 00:39:03.123
Good.

495
00:39:03.557 --> 00:39:04.992
Well, let's finish the job.

496
00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:08.162
What is that? Do you see it?

497
00:39:10.030 --> 00:39:12.732
What?

498
00:39:12.865 --> 00:39:14.535
-Dude, I don't know.
-Never mind, dude.


499
00:39:14.668 --> 00:39:16.136
Never mind.

500
00:39:21.041 --> 00:39:23.743
- Try that.
- There she is.


501
00:39:29.782 --> 00:39:31.285
Oh, there it is.

502
00:39:31.418 --> 00:39:33.454
Timber!

503
00:39:51.205 --> 00:39:52.439
Tell me about that story,
you know,


504
00:39:52.606 --> 00:39:54.375
what you were saying
about the Piglady?


505
00:39:54.508 --> 00:39:56.010
Well,
there was just some folklore


506
00:39:56.143 --> 00:39:58.479
around a couple
of disappearances,


507
00:39:58.878 --> 00:40:00.581
one being her husband.

508
00:40:01.482 --> 00:40:04.585
Apparently, she would feed
the victims to her pigs


509
00:40:04.752 --> 00:40:06.819
and she had an ongoing
relationship with them


510
00:40:06.954 --> 00:40:08.255
or something,
I don't know, Tony.


511
00:40:08.422 --> 00:40:10.224
-I don't know.
-You mean like beastiality?


512
00:40:10.391 --> 00:40:12.493
You tell me
she's a fucking pig whisperer.


513
00:40:13.060 --> 00:40:14.561
I think she just looks scary.

514
00:40:14.695 --> 00:40:15.795
I mean,

515
00:40:16.196 --> 00:40:17.665
I've been there
a few times with my dad


516
00:40:17.830 --> 00:40:19.733
-and I'm still alive.
-Hm.


517
00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:22.603
Besides,
she wouldn't kill a customer.


518
00:40:22.736 --> 00:40:24.371
It's a bad business.

519
00:40:24.538 --> 00:40:25.838
Yeah, I don't know,

520
00:40:26.006 --> 00:40:27.708
I just don't want to
piss off my girlfriend.


521
00:40:28.342 --> 00:40:30.810
Man the fuck up
and grow some balls.


522
00:40:31.178 --> 00:40:33.747
That's what she secretly
wants anyways, Tony.


523
00:40:34.148 --> 00:40:35.549
I don't think making eye contact

524
00:40:35.716 --> 00:40:38.085
with a flaming pig head
is what she wants, bro.


525
00:40:40.287 --> 00:40:41.722
Well then
she can get over it then.


526
00:40:42.189 --> 00:40:43.624
Here's what
we're gonna do, Tony.


527
00:40:44.091 --> 00:40:46.060
We'll sneak out
tomorrow after breakfast,


528
00:40:46.226 --> 00:40:47.361
we'll get the pig

529
00:40:47.494 --> 00:40:49.897
and the roast
will take place far,


530
00:40:50.064 --> 00:40:51.498
far from the cabin.

531
00:40:51.965 --> 00:40:53.467
And that's as nice as I can be.

532
00:40:53.634 --> 00:40:56.070
Come on, let's do it.

533
00:40:56.203 --> 00:40:57.504
All right.

534
00:41:08.048 --> 00:41:09.950
You boys don't belong here.

535
00:41:10.351 --> 00:41:12.086
It's much too dangerous for you.

536
00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:14.521
Just passing by, bud.

537
00:41:29.169 --> 00:41:31.004
- What a view, huh?
- Mm-hmm.


538
00:41:31.138 --> 00:41:32.406
That's what it's all about.

539
00:41:33.707 --> 00:41:34.975
What are we sipping on?

540
00:41:36.176 --> 00:41:37.444
Devil's gut.

541
00:41:39.747 --> 00:41:41.949
Cheers. To the pig lady.

542
00:41:46.820 --> 00:41:49.556
Skoal to experiences.

543
00:41:55.596 --> 00:41:56.663
Let's head back.

544
00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:01.935
Always leave a tool
how you found it, Tony.


545
00:42:03.404 --> 00:42:04.972
Let's go sharpen this blade.

546
00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:08.308
Saddle up.

547
00:42:11.478 --> 00:42:13.280
Don't be modest, Tony. Come on.

548
00:42:32.065 --> 00:42:33.534
Should have power in here.

549
00:42:36.103 --> 00:42:37.538
Take that,
so you can latch it back.


550
00:43:06.667 --> 00:43:07.968
Just latch that back
when you're done, Tony.


551
00:43:08.135 --> 00:43:09.269
I got you.

552
00:43:19.379 --> 00:43:20.981
- Yo, Hunter, come here.
- Yeah?


553
00:43:21.114 --> 00:43:22.115
Come here, come here, come here.

554
00:43:22.282 --> 00:43:23.517
What?

555
00:43:26.420 --> 00:43:27.788
I swear, I'm seeing things.

556
00:43:28.322 --> 00:43:29.590
I'm not crazy, I sw--

557
00:43:30.290 --> 00:43:31.592
What the fuck
are you seeing, dude?


558
00:43:31.725 --> 00:43:32.993
Come on.

Yep, yep, yep.

We just cut this tree.

00:44:07.261 --> 00:44:08.662
Sorry. We found it in storage.

567

We thought you guys were drunk
in the woods by now.


568

Actually,
I thought you guys were doing


569

some <i>Brokeback Mountain</i> shit.

Oh, are you jealous?

571
00:44:15.736 --> 00:44:17.804
Just-
- I'll put it--

572
00:44:17.939 --> 00:44:19.840
Sorry, Tony.
You had the experience at least.


573
00:44:20.574 --> 00:44:23.011
-Keep your head up, kid.
-Can you guys replant it?


574
00:44:23.176 --> 00:44:25.312
No, we can't replant it.
It's dead.


575
00:44:25.445 --> 00:44:26.580
We already cut it down.

576
00:44:27.047 --> 00:44:28.950
- That's not my problem.
- Get out of here.

I can't figure out a way


581
00:45:03.150 --> 00:45:04.284
to put this on.

582
00:45:04.418 --> 00:45:05.619

push it through.

Hey, Adrianna.

Your boy's been having
hallucinations today.


586

Really?
Like dead people?


587
00:45:14.328 --> 00:45:16.196
Uh, no, like pigs.

588
00:45:16.330 --> 00:45:17.664
And I know it sounds crazy.

589
00:45:17.831 --> 00:45:20.667

pigs running by the shed,

by the jacuzzi.

Is it the cute little pink ones
with wings?


592
00:45:26.273 --> 00:45:27.608
Okay, whatever, Brittany.

593
00:45:29.376 --> 00:45:31.511
This looks good here.

594
00:45:31.645 --> 00:45:33.513
Oh, okay.

595
00:45:33.647 --> 00:45:36.951
Well, I think
this looks good here.

00:45:38.218 --> 00:45:40.287

598
00:45:40.454 --> 00:45:42.522
Should we just go upstairs?

599
00:45:42.656 --> 00:45:44.124
Well, let's do that, yeah.
Let's go upstairs.


600
00:45:44.257 --> 00:45:45.559
I think-
- I think so.

601
00:45:45.726 --> 00:45:47.929
I'm the only one
fixing the tree over here.


602
00:45:48.261 --> 00:45:49.596
Good night, guys.

603
00:45:54.368 --> 00:45:55.802
-You want a bite?
-No.


604
00:45:55.970 --> 00:45:57.204
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.


605
00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:00.440
-You having a good time?
-Yeah.


606
00:46:30.737 --> 00:46:33.206
Is this your version
of a Christmas story?


607
00:46:34.075 --> 00:46:37.244
It's a little loud.
Can you turn it down, please?


608
00:46:38.545 --> 00:46:40.180
They've got to be
the most sadistic couple


609
00:46:40.313 --> 00:46:42.249
on Earth.

610
00:46:42.382 --> 00:46:45.019
Halloween on Christmas?

611
00:46:45.153 --> 00:46:46.687
Sorry, we must have fell asleep.

612
00:46:47.155 --> 00:46:49.090
I thought you were dead.

613
00:46:49.222 --> 00:46:50.724
You wouldn't get that lucky.

614
00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:57.330
All right, let's walk three feet
to a bed of air.


615
00:46:57.464 --> 00:46:58.699
I'll have to say

616
00:46:58.865 --> 00:47:00.968
sex on the air mattress
is new for me.


617
00:47:01.435 --> 00:47:03.236
It kind of turns me on.
How about you?


618
00:47:03.370 --> 00:47:06.074
Turns me on maybe,
but not a first.


619
00:47:06.239 --> 00:47:08.275
Ooh, competition.

620
00:47:08.442 --> 00:47:10.711
I like it.

621
00:47:11.411 --> 00:47:14.247
But be gentle with me.
I'm innocent.


622
00:47:15.716 --> 00:47:17.250
I'll hurt you
in a good kind of way.


623
00:47:18.052 --> 00:47:19.987
Some boys have all the luck.

624
00:47:20.154 --> 00:47:21.254
Tell me about it.

625
00:47:21.421 --> 00:47:24.224
But better yet, show me.

626
00:47:38.271 --> 00:47:39.806
That's the house right there.

627
00:47:51.651 --> 00:47:53.253
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to bother you.


628
00:47:53.386 --> 00:47:55.957
We actually just wanna purchase
a pig from you.


629
00:47:56.323 --> 00:47:57.357
How big you want?

630
00:47:57.925 --> 00:48:00.594
Uh, uh, just enough
to feed a few people.


631
00:48:01.261 --> 00:48:04.297
$2 a pound
is typically what I charge.


632
00:48:04.431 --> 00:48:07.201
<i>-You gonna haul it off?</i>
<i>-Yes, ma'am.</i>


633
00:48:07.634 --> 00:48:09.436
100-- 125.

634
00:48:11.939 --> 00:48:14.441
Okay, uh, we'll take it.

635
00:48:15.176 --> 00:48:16.543
Randy!

636
00:48:19.346 --> 00:48:20.580
Yeah?

637
00:48:20.747 --> 00:48:21.983
Butcher these kids
a suckling.


638
00:48:24.384 --> 00:48:25.685
Which one?

639
00:48:26.386 --> 00:48:27.754
One of the little ones.

640
00:48:29.856 --> 00:48:31.225
You want it butchered or killed?

641
00:48:31.358 --> 00:48:32.626
Uh, both, please.

642
00:48:32.793 --> 00:48:34.528
I'm sorry, you'll have to
forgive my friend.


643
00:48:34.661 --> 00:48:36.429
He's not used to killing
what he eats.


644
00:48:36.596 --> 00:48:37.664
We're gonna do the butchering.

645
00:48:38.166 --> 00:48:40.600
- California?
- Yes, ma'am.


646
00:48:40.767 --> 00:48:42.136
Randy will take care of you.

647
00:48:42.302 --> 00:48:43.503
Hope you ain't got far to go.

648
00:48:43.637 --> 00:48:44.704
Nope,
just over the mountain here.


649
00:48:44.838 --> 00:48:46.274
Staying at my dad's cabin.

650
00:48:46.439 --> 00:48:47.674
Over the mountain?

651
00:48:48.708 --> 00:48:50.343
Is your dad Henry?

652
00:48:50.477 --> 00:48:51.478
That's him.

653
00:48:51.645 --> 00:48:52.546
Tell him
to quit calling,


654
00:48:52.679 --> 00:48:54.048
my land ain't for sale.

655
00:48:55.283 --> 00:48:56.650
I'll pass it along.

656
00:48:56.817 --> 00:48:58.418
I'm not here to take your land
from you, Miss.


657
00:48:58.752 --> 00:49:00.587
I try to stay out
of my family business.


658
00:49:00.754 --> 00:49:02.522
- But you have a good day.
- All right.


659
00:49:02.924 --> 00:49:05.159
And you have yourselves
a good stay.


660
00:49:05.725 --> 00:49:06.994
Thank you.

661
00:49:13.366 --> 00:49:14.902
Unless you boys
want to hang around,


662
00:49:15.069 --> 00:49:19.339
I suggest you go wait down there
if you can't handle the reality.


663
00:49:19.472 --> 00:49:21.242
We'll wait in the Jeep.

664
00:49:21.374 --> 00:49:22.642
Thanks.

665
00:49:23.945 --> 00:49:24.912
Dude.

666
00:49:25.046 --> 00:49:26.247
You told 'em
where we were staying?


667
00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:27.814
Don't worry about it, Tony,

668
00:49:27.982 --> 00:49:29.884
I've been dying to use my weapon
anyways.


669
00:49:34.487 --> 00:49:35.655
Something's not right with you,
man,


670
00:49:35.822 --> 00:49:37.124
I figured
you'd want to be out there.


671
00:49:37.291 --> 00:49:38.893
You know, watching him
blow a pig's head off.


672
00:49:39.593 --> 00:49:41.195
Too up close
and personal for me, Tony.


673
00:49:41.329 --> 00:49:42.596
I'm retired.

674
00:49:43.864 --> 00:49:46.901
But after the fact, no problem.

675
00:49:53.174 --> 00:49:55.575
Brit, did you fill up
the hot tub yet?


676
00:49:55.709 --> 00:49:57.410
Of course, just like you asked.

677
00:49:57.544 --> 00:49:58.845
You're the best, babe.

678
00:50:04.551 --> 00:50:06.120
Did you even bring trunks?

679
00:50:06.287 --> 00:50:07.721
I got my boxers.

680
00:50:10.091 --> 00:50:12.326
I think it's gonna rain.

681
00:50:12.459 --> 00:50:14.095
Ah, they have a saying
in Oregon.


682
00:50:14.228 --> 00:50:17.231
Wait five minutes,
the weather changes.


683
00:50:17.365 --> 00:50:19.532
Okay.

684
00:50:19.666 --> 00:50:21.868
Tony! Hot tub in five.

685
00:50:23.237 --> 00:50:25.339
Adrianna! Hot tub in ten.

686
00:50:25.472 --> 00:50:27.674
- 10-4.
- It's a date.


687
00:50:50.932 --> 00:50:52.666
Oh, what a life, Tony.

688
00:50:58.638 --> 00:51:00.540
Oh, my God.
I'm so ready for this.


689
00:51:00.674 --> 00:51:01.841
Damn, ladies!

690
00:51:01.976 --> 00:51:03.177
It better be hot, boys.

691
00:51:03.543 --> 00:51:05.679
The water's warm.
Come on in.


692
00:51:08.149 --> 00:51:09.984
Ooh!

693
00:51:15.323 --> 00:51:17.091
Don't mind if I do, boys.

694
00:51:19.260 --> 00:51:20.227
Ooh!

695
00:51:20.361 --> 00:51:21.395
Okay,

696
00:51:21.528 --> 00:51:22.862
-she's showing tit!
-What?


697
00:51:22.997 --> 00:51:25.366
They're not gonna
hang like this forever.


698
00:51:25.498 --> 00:51:27.234
I have more class than that.

699
00:51:27.401 --> 00:51:29.136
So bougie.

700
00:51:29.303 --> 00:51:30.770
My parents taught me better.

701
00:51:30.938 --> 00:51:32.539
My parents taught me shit.

702
00:51:33.207 --> 00:51:35.910
Yeah, well,
I think that my mom was a slut.


703
00:51:37.278 --> 00:51:40.081
So, Tony,
what do you think about it?


704
00:51:42.350 --> 00:51:44.617
Hmm, you know, 
I think, uh...

705
00:51:46.120 --> 00:51:47.188
I say fuck it.

706
00:51:48.990 --> 00:51:51.926
Fuck it. It's Christmas. YOLO!

707
00:51:56.964 --> 00:51:59.367
- See? Freedom.
- Oh, my God.


708
00:52:00.267 --> 00:52:02.769
It's kind of nice,
I'm not gonna lie.


709
00:52:10.277 --> 00:52:12.146
I feel like we should
have some more bubbles though,


710
00:52:12.313 --> 00:52:13.646
don't you think?

711
00:52:14.348 --> 00:52:16.516
No? Okay.

712
00:52:17.418 --> 00:52:18.685
I saw a creek in the back,

713
00:52:18.852 --> 00:52:20.787
maybe we can go skinny dipping
next time.


714
00:52:20.955 --> 00:52:24.158
Oh, I like
where your mind is headed.


715
00:52:33.700 --> 00:52:35.269
Yeah, the temperature's good.

716
00:52:37.204 --> 00:52:40.207
Holy shit, Tony, I don't think
you're crazy after all.


717
00:52:40.374 --> 00:52:42.542
Guys, look at the pigs!

718
00:52:43.344 --> 00:52:44.611
Look!

719
00:52:46.347 --> 00:52:48.815
- What?
- Look! Right there.


720
00:52:48.983 --> 00:52:50.217
I don't see anything.

721
00:52:50.351 --> 00:52:51.886
It was literally right there.

722
00:52:52.420 --> 00:52:54.654
I think both of you
are losing your shit.


723
00:52:54.821 --> 00:52:56.524
I think you're crazy.

724
00:53:00.961 --> 00:53:03.064
So, Tony,
how about that campfire?


725
00:53:03.197 --> 00:53:04.731
Yeah, man.
That's a good idea.


726
00:53:11.505 --> 00:53:13.107
What's taking them so long?

727
00:53:14.607 --> 00:53:16.944
Let's just get dressed
and head down to the fire.


728
00:53:17.111 --> 00:53:18.979
We don't need them to escort us.

729
00:53:19.113 --> 00:53:22.917
Yeah, we might want
to hang out here for a few.


730
00:53:24.418 --> 00:53:26.420
Son of a bitch. Pig roast?

731
00:53:27.354 --> 00:53:29.190
He can sleep
on the fucking couch.


732
00:53:29.323 --> 00:53:31.158
And what were you trying to do?
Hide it from me?


733
00:53:31.325 --> 00:53:32.625
I'm not hiding
anything from you,


734
00:53:32.792 --> 00:53:33.994
I just told you.

735
00:53:34.128 --> 00:53:35.595
Yeah, after hiding it
the whole time.


736
00:53:35.728 --> 00:53:37.697
Nobody's hiding
shit from you, girl.


737
00:53:37.864 --> 00:53:39.300
We're all just trying
to have a good time,


738
00:53:39.433 --> 00:53:40.800
which seems impossible for some.

739
00:53:41.235 --> 00:53:43.870
You know,
you've been in SoCal too long.


740
00:53:44.038 --> 00:53:46.706
Take that pussy
off its pedestal.


741
00:53:46.840 --> 00:53:49.310
What the fuck does that mean,
bitch?


742
00:53:51.011 --> 00:53:52.379
Oh, I'm the bitch?

743
00:53:52.712 --> 00:53:54.181
I'm sorry,

744
00:53:54.315 --> 00:53:56.417
let the three of us just
roll out the red carpet for you


745
00:53:56.550 --> 00:53:58.352
and cater on your every need.

746
00:53:58.785 --> 00:53:59.786
I don't see how Tony does it.

747
00:53:59.954 --> 00:54:01.122
You are a fucking bitch

748
00:54:01.255 --> 00:54:02.856
and don't include
my boyfriend's name


749
00:54:03.023 --> 00:54:04.291
- in your mouth.
- Really?


750
00:54:04.458 --> 00:54:05.625
Is that how you're gonna be?

751
00:54:06.060 --> 00:54:09.396
Then go to your room, child,
before I go the fuck off!


752
00:54:45.499 --> 00:54:47.101
Hey, girl. Let's not argue.

753
00:54:48.668 --> 00:54:49.769
I know you can hear me.

754
00:54:50.204 --> 00:54:53.673
Let's just appreciate
the differences.


755
00:54:55.476 --> 00:54:56.944
I'm listening.

756
00:54:57.111 --> 00:54:58.946
I'll ask the boys not to leave
any remains after dinner,


757
00:54:59.113 --> 00:55:00.247
but they've got a fire going,

758
00:55:00.381 --> 00:55:02.116
and I really wanna hang out
with you.


759
00:55:02.283 --> 00:55:04.084
YOLO.

760
00:55:04.218 --> 00:55:05.718
Okay. You're right.

761
00:55:06.453 --> 00:55:09.190
I'm sorry
for being such a prima donna.


762
00:55:14.995 --> 00:55:16.763
All right.
Go get ready. Come on.


763
00:55:17.231 --> 00:55:20.000
-I'm guessing it's cold outside?
-Yes, grab a coat.


764
00:55:23.971 --> 00:55:25.339
Well, I hope you know
where you're going.


765
00:55:25.472 --> 00:55:27.141
I don't want to get lost
in the woods.


766
00:55:27.274 --> 00:55:29.276
Hunter left out glow sticks.

767
00:55:29.410 --> 00:55:30.644
Of course he did.

768
00:55:30.810 --> 00:55:33.447
Adrianna, the one good thing
about dating a Marine


769
00:55:33.614 --> 00:55:35.049
is that they always lead
the way.


770
00:55:35.182 --> 00:55:36.749
Well,
at least he's thoughtful.


771
00:55:37.117 --> 00:55:38.485
Tony's thoughtful, too.

772
00:55:38.919 --> 00:55:40.421
I wish Hunter
was more thoughtful,


773
00:55:40.554 --> 00:55:41.821
but what are you gonna do?

774
00:55:44.857 --> 00:55:46.126
Oh, fuck!

775
00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:50.064
- God, are you okay?
- Ow, no!


776
00:55:50.797 --> 00:55:53.100
Why does this happen to me?

777
00:55:53.234 --> 00:55:56.337
- Because you're a bitch.
- Oh, fuck you, bitch.


778
00:55:57.837 --> 00:55:59.073
A long weekend.

779
00:56:41.548 --> 00:56:43.884
Goddamn it, Tony.
What the fuck?


780
00:56:46.620 --> 00:56:47.755
Oh, fuck, babe,

781
00:56:47.921 --> 00:56:49.290
you weren't supposed
to see this.


782
00:56:49.423 --> 00:56:50.857
I thought you were eating,
not carving up flesh!


783
00:56:51.325 --> 00:56:52.792
My God. Sorry, don't hate me.

784
00:56:53.160 --> 00:56:55.296
I'm gonna come grab you
when I'm all cleaned up.


785
00:56:55.429 --> 00:56:56.497
I love you!

786
00:56:57.064 --> 00:56:58.332
Adrianna!

787
00:57:03.537 --> 00:57:04.772
Why is she limping?

788
00:57:06.173 --> 00:57:07.608
I don't know how you do it, man.

789
00:57:08.142 --> 00:57:09.209
All right, let's just finish

790
00:57:09.343 --> 00:57:10.511
what we started.

791
00:57:11.745 --> 00:57:12.980
Oh, man, okay.

792
00:57:13.447 --> 00:57:14.748
I'm fucked,
you know that, right?


793
00:57:14.881 --> 00:57:15.983
No, you're fine. Come on.

794
00:57:16.849 --> 00:57:18.851
She'll get over it.
No one's getting laid tonight.


795
00:57:29.396 --> 00:57:33.067
Tony, what do you think
about your first pig roast?


796
00:57:33.901 --> 00:57:35.803
Let him finish.

797
00:57:35.969 --> 00:57:37.304
I-
- I didn't get to start.

798
00:57:38.072 --> 00:57:40.040
Uh, to be honest,
it was an experience.


799
00:57:40.541 --> 00:57:43.010
That you'll never do again.

800
00:57:43.644 --> 00:57:44.812
No, I'll do it again.

801
00:57:44.945 --> 00:57:46.547
No, I will definitely
do it again.


802
00:57:46.680 --> 00:57:48.215
My man, my man, my man.

803
00:57:48.382 --> 00:57:50.317
But-- but-- but what I wanna
do differently the next time


804
00:57:50.484 --> 00:57:52.252
is I want to actually kill
the pig.


805
00:57:52.386 --> 00:57:55.522
I wanna-- I wanna hunt,
trap, and kill the pig.


806
00:57:55.656 --> 00:57:56.856
You know, get a little--

807
00:57:56.990 --> 00:57:59.093
little primal situation
going before


808
00:57:59.259 --> 00:58:00.694
otherwise I feel bad, you know?

809
00:58:00.860 --> 00:58:03.263
Just seeing a dead pig
hanging up and all that, so...


810
00:58:03.397 --> 00:58:05.199
Brittany,
why aren't you fucking drinking?


811
00:58:05.366 --> 00:58:07.167
One of us
has to be the responsible one


812
00:58:07.301 --> 00:58:10.671
-and pace ourselves.
-Since when are you that person?


813
00:58:11.105 --> 00:58:12.606
Party pooper!

814
00:58:13.607 --> 00:58:17.277
I'm glad my intoxication levels
are of the utmost concern.


815
00:58:17.411 --> 00:58:18.579
Honestly,
I'm with you, Brit.


816
00:58:18.712 --> 00:58:19.913
Thank you.

817
00:58:20.080 --> 00:58:22.116
Ah, I say we king her
designated driver


818
00:58:22.249 --> 00:58:23.517
or something
at least comparable.


819
00:58:23.951 --> 00:58:25.652
I second that notion, Tony.

820
00:58:26.186 --> 00:58:28.055
All in favor say aye.

821
00:58:28.222 --> 00:58:29.957
- Aye.
- Aye.


822
00:58:30.124 --> 00:58:31.625
Any opposed?

823
00:58:32.126 --> 00:58:33.394
Well, I am honored.

824
00:58:33.761 --> 00:58:36.930
Now, baby,
can you massage my shoulders?


825
00:58:41.402 --> 00:58:43.137
You know,
I should hate the process,


826
00:58:43.303 --> 00:58:45.139
but that pig roast was so good.

827
00:58:45.272 --> 00:58:47.775
You boys did a great job.

828
00:58:47.908 --> 00:58:49.743
Don't hate the process,
princess.


829
00:58:50.177 --> 00:58:51.645
Here we go.

830
00:58:51.779 --> 00:58:53.213
Didn't you used to eat meat?

831
00:58:53.614 --> 00:58:55.682
Yeah,
that was before I was educated


832
00:58:55.849 --> 00:58:57.418
- on this topic.
- Oh!


833
00:58:57.551 --> 00:59:00.020
Or before you were a victim
of propaganda.


834
00:59:00.154 --> 00:59:01.655
Okay, no. Come on, guys.

835
00:59:01.789 --> 00:59:04.491
We were just all friendly,
buddy-buddy.


836
00:59:04.625 --> 00:59:05.559
Let's not go there.

837
00:59:05.692 --> 00:59:07.561
-Let's keep it down.
-My bad, my bad.


838
00:59:08.228 --> 00:59:11.532
-Think before you speak.
-Okay, okay, okay.


839
00:59:11.665 --> 00:59:12.800
Damn it.

840
00:59:12.966 --> 00:59:14.968
Tony, you take the floor,
I'm not winning this one.


841
00:59:17.738 --> 00:59:18.839
Okay.

842
00:59:19.306 --> 00:59:21.008
I got a little something
to lighten the spirits


843
00:59:21.141 --> 00:59:22.911
and give us
a little Christmas spirit...


844
00:59:23.076 --> 00:59:24.211
- Okay.
- ...if you will.


845
00:59:24.378 --> 00:59:25.479
Aw!

846
00:59:27.114 --> 00:59:28.949
It's a little poem.
I didn't write it.


847
00:59:29.616 --> 00:59:32.386
-I hope it rhymes.
-Her and her rhymes.


848
00:59:32.719 --> 00:59:33.922
It's a poem, so it rhymes,

849
00:59:34.087 --> 00:59:35.589
-but...
-I love a good rhyme.


850
00:59:36.490 --> 00:59:38.492
Uh, it goes
a little something like this.


851
00:59:41.495 --> 00:59:43.096
"T'was the night
before Christmas.


852
00:59:43.997 --> 00:59:47.334
When all through the house
not a creature was stirring."


853
00:59:47.501 --> 00:59:50.270
- Except for a mouse.
- No, not even a mouse.


854
00:59:52.306 --> 00:59:54.007
Honestly, I don't know
the rest of that, so...


855
00:59:54.174 --> 00:59:56.210
Oh, come on!

856
00:59:56.376 --> 00:59:57.912
-I was getting into it.
-I know.


857
00:59:58.045 --> 00:59:59.680
Well, let me get you
back into it.


858
00:59:59.847 --> 01:00:02.483
- The suspense.
- I gotta just pull it up.


859
01:00:02.616 --> 01:00:03.750
Okay.

860
01:00:03.918 --> 01:00:05.552
"Not a creature was stirring.
Not even a mouse.


861
01:00:06.353 --> 01:00:09.389
The stockings were hung
by the chimney with care.


862
01:00:10.557 --> 01:00:12.993
In hopes that Saint Nicholas
soon would be there.


863
01:00:13.594 --> 01:00:15.629
The children were nestled
all snug in their beds


864
01:00:15.796 --> 01:00:19.700
while visions of sugar plums
danced in their heads."


865
01:00:19.833 --> 01:00:23.905
Oh, baby, you're so sweet.

866
01:00:24.037 --> 01:00:26.273
- Who's getting laid tonight?
- Ah, come on.


867
01:00:26.406 --> 01:00:27.774
You wanna place a wager?

868
01:00:27.942 --> 01:00:29.510
Probably-- probably you,
Mr. Manly Man.


869
01:00:29.643 --> 01:00:30.777
Oh, God.

870
01:00:30.945 --> 01:00:32.546
Oh, looks like
you're winning the game here.


871
01:00:35.282 --> 01:00:36.750
Thank you
for bringing us here.


872
01:00:36.918 --> 01:00:38.452
- I'm glad you came. Thank you.
- Of course.


873
01:00:38.585 --> 01:00:40.654
The one good thing
you did for us.


874
01:00:40.787 --> 01:00:42.322
Oh, is that a compliment?

875
01:00:42.456 --> 01:00:44.458
That was a compliment.

876
01:00:44.591 --> 01:00:46.093
I'll take it.

877
01:00:46.260 --> 01:00:47.427
If that's all
I can get from you.


878
01:00:47.561 --> 01:00:48.897
You know,
you two have been going at it


879
01:00:49.029 --> 01:00:50.999
since the moment
we left this trip.


880
01:00:51.164 --> 01:00:53.300
Come on. Okay, we're cool.

881
01:00:53.667 --> 01:00:55.135
Right, Hunter?

882
01:00:56.169 --> 01:00:57.838
Let's pump it out. Huh?

883
01:00:57.972 --> 01:01:00.407
I'll take it.
I'll take it for now. Yeah.


884
01:01:02.175 --> 01:01:03.945
Well, on that note,

885
01:01:04.077 --> 01:01:06.413
I am gonna order a pizza

886
01:01:06.580 --> 01:01:09.116
since you savages
had your feast.


887
01:01:10.250 --> 01:01:12.085
-Which way is the house?
-This way.


888
01:01:12.219 --> 01:01:13.186
This way. Go this way.

889
01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:15.155
No, Hunter. Babe--

890
01:01:15.289 --> 01:01:16.423
Come on, Hunter!

891
01:01:16.590 --> 01:01:18.425
I thought
we just had a thing going.


892
01:01:18.592 --> 01:01:20.494
You know I gotta fuck it up,
come on.


893
01:01:21.528 --> 01:01:22.729
Do you need a lamp?

894
01:01:22.897 --> 01:01:24.865
Uh, I have my phone.

895
01:01:25.599 --> 01:01:28.235
Don't save me a piece
unless there's pepperoni on it!


896
01:01:31.371 --> 01:01:32.773
I love to watch you leave.

897
01:01:33.173 --> 01:01:34.641
How romantic.

898
01:01:35.342 --> 01:01:37.411
Babe,
save me a piece, please.


899
01:01:44.919 --> 01:01:47.621
Well, ladies,
I'm gonna go use the restroom.


900
01:01:53.126 --> 01:01:55.629
Baby, why don't you just go
pop a squat in the woods?


901
01:01:55.762 --> 01:01:56.730
I said restroom.

902
01:01:56.863 --> 01:01:58.665
Who said anything
about a number one?


903
01:01:58.832 --> 01:02:01.168
- Fucking disgusting.
- You asked for it.


904
01:02:01.301 --> 01:02:03.972
Hey, uh,
bring me back a slice please.


905
01:02:04.137 --> 01:02:05.305
And my girlfriend.

906
01:02:05.439 --> 01:02:06.908
And make sure
you wash your hands.


907
01:02:07.441 --> 01:02:09.443
And make sure
you clean it up before I go.


908
01:02:09.576 --> 01:02:11.612
Two in the pink,
one in the stink!


909
01:02:11.778 --> 01:02:15.248
Shocker!
Behave yourselves, boys.


910
01:03:09.003 --> 01:03:10.404
Oh, my God, asshole!

911
01:03:10.537 --> 01:03:12.073
What are you trying to do?
Give me a miscarriage?


912
01:03:12.239 --> 01:03:13.473
I know, I know.

913
01:03:24.152 --> 01:03:25.752
Tony, come the fuck on!

914
01:03:29.023 --> 01:03:30.590
Fuck!

915
01:03:58.852 --> 01:04:02.090
It's okay, Hunter.
It's just my friend Marcus.


916
01:04:02.255 --> 01:04:04.224
Marcus from Hillcrest.

917
01:04:11.331 --> 01:04:12.699
Hi!

918
01:04:13.366 --> 01:04:14.634
Sorry.

919
01:04:15.435 --> 01:04:16.703
I'm Marcus.

920
01:04:17.604 --> 01:04:18.739
You gave me
a fucking heart attack.


921
01:04:18.906 --> 01:04:20.307
You see what I'm saying, Brit?

922
01:04:22.210 --> 01:04:23.276
Figures you'd have
a little boy toy


923
01:04:23.443 --> 01:04:24.644
running around with you.

924
01:04:24.778 --> 01:04:26.114
Yeah, I don't think he was ready

925
01:04:26.279 --> 01:04:28.015
-for this little escapade.
-Good.


926
01:04:28.182 --> 01:04:30.218
You would have done
the same thing, Hunter.


927
01:04:30.383 --> 01:04:31.551
Do not compare us.

928
01:04:31.718 --> 01:04:33.487
Ease up
and turn down that headlamp.


929
01:04:33.620 --> 01:04:35.322
Are you trying to blind us?

930
01:04:37.191 --> 01:04:38.658
Let me ask you.

931
01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:42.395
Have you ever been blown
by a tranny?


932
01:04:42.529 --> 01:04:43.965
Uh...

933
01:04:44.364 --> 01:04:46.633
- Come again?
- You heard me.


934
01:04:48.401 --> 01:04:50.604
No fucking way!

935
01:04:50.771 --> 01:04:53.107
I brought extra
because I figured you'd want.


936
01:04:53.273 --> 01:04:54.441
Oh, my God.

937
01:04:54.608 --> 01:04:55.842
Well,
why didn't you say so?


938
01:04:55.977 --> 01:04:57.611
I've been dreaming
of a white Christmas.


939
01:04:58.678 --> 01:05:02.984
<i>♪ Just like the ones</i>
<i>I used to know ♪</i>


940
01:05:05.452 --> 01:05:06.520
I was worried the fuck out.

941
01:05:06.653 --> 01:05:07.989
What happened? Who was that?

942
01:05:08.122 --> 01:05:09.523
That was the snowman, Tony.

943
01:05:09.656 --> 01:05:11.324
Christmas comes early this year.

944
01:05:11.458 --> 01:05:12.894
Bullshit.
How much does he have?


945
01:05:13.027 --> 01:05:13.995
Enough.

946
01:05:14.128 --> 01:05:15.395
Enough to kill a snowman?

947
01:05:15.529 --> 01:05:16.496
And his reindeer.
Let's hit that.


948
01:05:16.630 --> 01:05:18.799
Oh, fuck! My man!

949
01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:22.636
I love you.
I'm so glad you're here.


950
01:05:22.803 --> 01:05:24.371
What made you decide
on this voyage?


951
01:05:24.504 --> 01:05:25.907
Was it my pitch?

952
01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:27.607
I need-- I need
a little adventure in my life.


953
01:05:27.741 --> 01:05:30.077
- And why not? It's Christmas.
- Great.


954
01:05:30.244 --> 01:05:32.013
But what about work?

955
01:05:32.879 --> 01:05:35.917
I told my boss
I had a family emergency.


956
01:05:36.050 --> 01:05:37.584
Classic.

957
01:05:37.751 --> 01:05:40.453
But thanks for bringing blow
the one time I can't do any.


958
01:05:40.620 --> 01:05:42.924
Sorry. I know, I had to, Brit.

959
01:05:43.857 --> 01:05:46.027
-I won't let you do any, girl.
-Thanks.


960
01:06:19.392 --> 01:06:22.429
Please, no! Please! No!

961
01:06:25.665 --> 01:06:27.801
Please, just leave me alone!

962
01:06:28.269 --> 01:06:31.404
No!

963
01:06:31.538 --> 01:06:34.008
No!

964
01:07:12.914 --> 01:07:13.981
God, dude!

965
01:07:14.481 --> 01:07:17.584
Surprise!

966
01:07:17.751 --> 01:07:18.986
There's Tyler.

967
01:07:19.153 --> 01:07:21.155
Oh, my God! I knew it!

968
01:07:21.289 --> 01:07:23.991
Okay, I really need to pee
or I'm gonna go in my leggings.


969
01:07:24.457 --> 01:07:25.692
Where the hell's Adrianna?

970
01:07:25.859 --> 01:07:27.028
Probably in the cabin pouting.

971
01:07:27.161 --> 01:07:28.396
I'll let her know
we're in the presence


972
01:07:28.528 --> 01:07:30.597
of your majesty.

973
01:07:30.764 --> 01:07:32.866
Tell that sack of trash
I said get her ass out here.


974
01:07:33.935 --> 01:07:35.002
Got it.

975
01:09:04.258 --> 01:09:05.825
Adrianna!

976
01:09:06.626 --> 01:09:07.928
Brit!

977
01:09:08.095 --> 01:09:10.164
Brit!

978
01:09:10.730 --> 01:09:11.698
Adrianna!

979
01:09:17.104 --> 01:09:18.872
Adrianna?

980
01:09:22.476 --> 01:09:23.843
Adrianna!

981
01:09:29.250 --> 01:09:30.351
Adrianna!

982
01:09:40.327 --> 01:09:41.795
Adrianna!

983
01:09:48.302 --> 01:09:49.370
Hey!

984
01:09:50.237 --> 01:09:51.972
Where did you guys come from?

985
01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:55.142
All right, it's okay.

986
01:09:55.276 --> 01:09:56.776
You guys are shaking.

987
01:09:58.012 --> 01:09:59.080
Here.

988
01:10:00.613 --> 01:10:02.049
Adrianna!

989
01:10:44.757 --> 01:10:47.394
You scary bitches!

990
01:10:48.529 --> 01:10:51.232
I figured you were out there
lurking somewhere.


991
01:10:51.398 --> 01:10:52.665
Mm-hmm. How'd you know?

992
01:10:52.832 --> 01:10:55.236
I can smell your perfume
a mile away.


993
01:10:56.170 --> 01:10:57.037
I sure hope so.

994
01:10:57.171 --> 01:10:58.738
I sprayed on
my Dolce, okurrr.


995
01:10:59.106 --> 01:11:01.641
-Hi. I'm Tyler.
-Hunter.


996
01:11:02.243 --> 01:11:04.844
And that girl you heard scream?
Tony.


997
01:11:06.646 --> 01:11:08.215
Hell of an introduction, Tyler.

998
01:11:08.748 --> 01:11:10.783
No, thanks. Sorry.

999
01:11:10.951 --> 01:11:14.121
I didn't mean to catch you
with your hands full.


1000
01:11:15.189 --> 01:11:17.458
Actually I haven't seen my cock
since you scared me.


1001
01:11:17.591 --> 01:11:20.161
Last time I checked
I think it was in my ass.


1002
01:11:20.561 --> 01:11:22.829
I'm sure you know a little
something about that, don't you?


1003
01:11:22.997 --> 01:11:25.366
What? Your asshole?

1004
01:11:25.499 --> 01:11:27.667
Whatever, man.
I suck at being a smart ass.


1005
01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:29.069
Yeah, you do.

1006
01:11:29.203 --> 01:11:31.038
- Ladies.
- Marcus!


1007
01:11:31.172 --> 01:11:32.606
Are we ready
to get this party started?


1008
01:11:32.772 --> 01:11:34.375
- Yas queen!
- Bravo.


1009
01:11:34.909 --> 01:11:37.810
- About time!
- I mean, right?


1010
01:11:37.978 --> 01:11:40.813
Ladies and gentlemen,
bump, anybody?


1011
01:11:40.948 --> 01:11:42.917
Do you have
the proper tools?


1012
01:11:43.083 --> 01:11:46.287
Blades, dollar bills.
You must not know who I am.


1013
01:11:46.420 --> 01:11:48.721
Ooh, a real tough guy.

1014
01:11:55.529 --> 01:11:57.231
Chop-chop! We ain't got all day.

1015
01:11:57.398 --> 01:11:59.300
Tony Tone, next in line.

1016
01:11:59.699 --> 01:12:00.968
Step right up.

1017
01:12:02.970 --> 01:12:04.771
I'm gonna go get Hurricane.

1018
01:12:04.905 --> 01:12:06.173
I'll be back.

1019
01:12:07.675 --> 01:12:09.809
One more, then you go, Marcus.

Did someone order

1042
01:15:44.291 --> 01:15:47.060
Hurricane. Hurricane.

1043
01:18:29.523 --> 01:18:32.759
Who was that?
You guys never quit, do you?


1044
01:18:32.927 --> 01:18:35.897
Judging by the scream,
I would say that's a bitch.


1045
01:18:36.296 --> 01:18:37.397
Yeah.

1046
01:18:37.999 --> 01:18:39.800
You never know what
you're gonna get with Marcus.


1047
01:18:39.934 --> 01:18:41.501
He's a mixed bag.

1048
01:18:42.436 --> 01:18:44.038
I haven't seen
the girls in a while.


1049
01:18:44.471 --> 01:18:46.273
I'm gonna go see
what's popping.


1050
01:18:47.841 --> 01:18:48.977
What, are you scared?

1051
01:18:49.142 --> 01:18:50.410
No.

1052
01:18:50.544 --> 01:18:51.745
I did not come
all the way here


1053
01:18:51.878 --> 01:18:53.547
to hang out
with choads all night.


1054
01:18:53.714 --> 01:18:54.681
And who knows?

1055
01:18:54.848 --> 01:18:56.350
Bigfoot
could be the fuck out there.


1056
01:18:56.516 --> 01:18:58.619
-Maybe.
-I think he's scared, Tony.


1057
01:18:59.353 --> 01:19:00.621
That he is.

1058
01:19:10.797 --> 01:19:12.866
And thanks
for the party favor.


1059
01:19:14.068 --> 01:19:15.168
You got it!

1060
01:19:15.335 --> 01:19:16.870
Because
the next round is on you.


1061
01:19:17.437 --> 01:19:19.107
I have scales in the drawer

1062
01:19:19.272 --> 01:19:20.540
left of the sink.

1063
01:19:20.674 --> 01:19:22.876
Weight me out an eight ball.

1064
01:19:23.011 --> 01:19:24.478
Aye, aye captain.

1065
01:19:24.611 --> 01:19:26.246
Shake it, don't break it,
baby.


1066
01:19:27.814 --> 01:19:29.416
I break dicks.

1067
01:19:31.284 --> 01:19:33.587
Hey, that dude, bro.

1068
01:20:00.681 --> 01:20:01.748
Girls?

1069
01:20:03.717 --> 01:20:04.785
Brittany?

1070
01:20:07.889 --> 01:20:09.756
Y'all bitches
better not be sleeping.


1071
01:20:09.924 --> 01:20:11.224
I will not allow it.

1072
01:20:13.460 --> 01:20:15.796
Y'all better have
some sparkling seltzer, okay?


1073
01:20:22.170 --> 01:20:24.271
Hmm.

1074
01:20:26.573 --> 01:20:28.742
Okay. Well,
I will settle for wine.


1075
01:20:28.910 --> 01:20:29.977
Girls?

1076
01:20:53.500 --> 01:20:54.936
Shit.

1077
01:22:25.026 --> 01:22:27.661
Where the hell is everybody?
I feel like I'm missing out.


1078
01:22:29.297 --> 01:22:30.797
No one cares, man.

1079
01:22:31.765 --> 01:22:34.936
Although it is kind of weird
that Brittany's not out here.


1080
01:22:35.303 --> 01:22:36.837
She loves campfires.

1081
01:22:38.605 --> 01:22:40.774
Yeah, I'm gonna go check.
And give me your keys.


1082
01:22:40.908 --> 01:22:42.642
I'm gonna go
get my weed and my money.


1083
01:22:48.916 --> 01:22:50.117
All right,
I'm right behind you.


1084
01:22:50.284 --> 01:22:51.818
I'm just going to
put out this campfire.


1085
01:22:51.986 --> 01:22:53.020
Yep.

1086
01:23:32.425 --> 01:23:33.693
Adrianna?

1087
01:23:52.545 --> 01:23:53.813
Brittany?

1088
01:24:13.301 --> 01:24:14.567
Brittany?

1089
01:24:59.612 --> 01:25:01.916
Shit!

1090
01:28:17.844 --> 01:28:19.213
Fucking shit!

1091
01:28:44.405 --> 01:28:46.407
Who moved
the fucking glow sticks?


1092
01:28:55.282 --> 01:28:57.184
Who moved
the fucking glow sticks?


1093
01:29:27.847 --> 01:29:29.116
Tony!

1094
01:29:31.851 --> 01:29:33.487
Tony!

1095
01:29:49.769 --> 01:29:51.038
Tony?

1096
01:29:51.905 --> 01:29:53.173
Tony?

1097
01:29:56.644 --> 01:29:57.911
Tony?

1098
01:30:01.881 --> 01:30:03.550
Jesus fucking Christ.

1099
01:30:13.227 --> 01:30:15.262
I'll fucking get 'em, Tony.

1100
01:30:22.636 --> 01:30:25.472
I will get 'em, buddy.
I will fucking get 'em.


1101
01:30:36.750 --> 01:30:39.320
I'm gonna get 'em, Tony.
I'm gonna fucking get 'em.


1102
01:30:48.962 --> 01:30:50.863
I'll fucking kill 'em, Tony.

1103
01:31:19.426 --> 01:31:20.928
Brittany!
Brittany!


1104
01:31:21.095 --> 01:31:22.062
Hunter, down here.

1105
01:31:22.196 --> 01:31:23.630
Thank God you're okay, babe.

1106
01:31:23.764 --> 01:31:25.566
They fucking killed Tony.

1107
01:31:27.534 --> 01:31:30.704
She killed everyone.
Who is she?
