1
00:01:51.961 --> 00:01:57.729
Fuck, the chicken's got away!
Go after that chicken, man!


2
00:02:00.337 --> 00:02:02.532
Go on, for fuck's sake!

3
00:02:06.643 --> 00:02:08.770
Get that chicken!

4
00:02:22.726 --> 00:02:25.422
If it's a good photo,
I'll get a job at the paper.


5
00:02:25.628 --> 00:02:27.789
- You think so, Rocket?
- Gotta take the risk.


6
00:02:27.997 --> 00:02:32.627
You'd risk your life
for a picture? Forget it!


7
00:02:33.203 --> 00:02:36.536
You think I want to meet up
with that motherfucking hood?


8
00:02:37.574 --> 00:02:41.442
Get that chicken, bro!

9
00:02:43.713 --> 00:02:46.739
Motherfucker! I told you
to grab that chicken!


10
00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.077
Outta my way!

11
00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:51.287
Get that chicken!

12
00:03:10.907 --> 00:03:12.636
If Li'l Z' catches you,
he'll kill you.


13
00:03:14.511 --> 00:03:17.275
Yeah, well,
he's gotta find me first.


14
00:03:26.222 --> 00:03:29.851
Hey, kid! Get that chicken!
Get that chicken!


15
00:03:32.395 --> 00:03:33.726
Shit! The cops!

16
00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.194
Don't fucking run off!

17
00:03:36.399 --> 00:03:38.196
Give me that.

18
00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.271
Hey, Melonhead! 
You fucking fag!

19
00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.831
A picture could change
my life, but...


20
00:03:47.043 --> 00:03:50.308
in the City of God, if you
run away, they get you...


21
00:03:50.914 --> 00:03:54.372
...and if you stay, they get you too.
- They're coming for us!


22
00:03:54.584 --> 00:03:57.246
It's been that way
ever since I was a kid...


23
00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:03.891
THE SIXTIES

24
00:04:10.834 --> 00:04:12.233
You're useless, man!

25
00:04:12.435 --> 00:04:15.268
- Go get the ball!
- Fucking useless!


26
00:04:18.374 --> 00:04:19.568
Hey, kid!

27
00:04:19.776 --> 00:04:22.802
Give me the ball, I wanna play.

28
00:04:24.614 --> 00:04:28.141
- It's not yours.
- You wanna mess with me?


29
00:04:28.351 --> 00:04:30.785
Fuck off.

30
00:04:30.987 --> 00:04:35.151
- What's your name?
- Sorry, I forgot to introduce myself.


31
00:04:35.358 --> 00:04:37.883
- My name's Rocket.
- Some advice, Rocket...


32
00:04:38.495 --> 00:04:41.658
Don't let Li'l Dice
touch that ball. He sucks.


33
00:04:42.165 --> 00:04:44.156
- You lose, pal.
- Go, Shaggy!


34
00:04:44.367 --> 00:04:46.597
That's Shaggy.

35
00:04:46.803 --> 00:04:50.204
To tell the story of the City of God,
I have to start with him.


36
00:04:50.406 --> 00:04:52.431
8, 9, 10, 11...

37
00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:58.113
But in order to tell Shaggy's story, I
must tell the story of the Tender Trio.


38
00:04:58.314 --> 00:05:02.512
Well, Shaggy? The gas truck's coming.
What are you fucking around for?


39
00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:04.653
You're not gonna chicken out...

40
00:05:07.991 --> 00:05:11.518
THE STORY OF THE TENDER TRIO

41
00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.658
The notorious Tender Trio
was legendary in the City of God.


42
00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:22.428
Shaggy...

43
00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:24.800
Clipper...

44
00:05:25.475 --> 00:05:26.942
and Goose.

45
00:05:28.878 --> 00:05:32.609
Tagging along were always
Li'l Dice and Benny...


46
00:05:32.815 --> 00:05:34.749
Shaggy's brother.

47
00:05:36.019 --> 00:05:39.682
I never had the courage
to follow my brother, Goose.


48
00:05:48.264 --> 00:05:50.232
Okay, let's go.

49
00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:53.027
Come on, Goose.

50
00:05:53.303 --> 00:05:54.793
Let's go!

51
00:06:04.781 --> 00:06:06.749
Stop! Stop!
Stop this fucker!


52
00:06:11.521 --> 00:06:15.355
Stop or l'll shoot, motherfucker!

53
00:06:15.558 --> 00:06:17.856
Get out!

54
00:06:18.261 --> 00:06:23.324
Hurry up, asshole!
Gimme the money!


55
00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:26.194
Who wants gas?

56
00:06:34.777 --> 00:06:38.304
More! You wanna die for your
boss' damn money?


57
00:06:38.514 --> 00:06:40.505
Shitloads of money here!

58
00:06:42.652 --> 00:06:44.950
You see, asshole?

59
00:06:45.955 --> 00:06:47.115
Asshole!

60
00:06:47.323 --> 00:06:49.291
Fuck! The cops!

61
00:06:52.629 --> 00:06:54.722
Let's get outta here!

62
00:06:58.768 --> 00:07:02.499
Clear out! The place is
crawling with cops!


63
00:07:18.287 --> 00:07:21.518
- Shaggy!
- The ball, Goose, it's yours!


64
00:07:31.434 --> 00:07:34.062
Back then, I thought
the guys in the Tender Trio...


65
00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:36.431
were the most dangerous hoods
in Rio.


66
00:07:36.639 --> 00:07:40.075
Here! Buy some new balls.

67
00:07:41.678 --> 00:07:45.079
But they were just amateurs.

68
00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:51.943
- Even my brother, Goose.
- Rocket, give this money to dad.


69
00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:56.422
But don't tell him it's from me.

70
00:07:56.626 --> 00:07:58.856
Okay?

71
00:07:59.062 --> 00:08:02.054
- Hey, Stringy!
- Yeah?


72
00:08:02.265 --> 00:08:04.529
Look how much l've got.

73
00:08:20.016 --> 00:08:24.749
We came to the City of God
hoping to find paradise.


74
00:08:24.954 --> 00:08:29.618
Many families were homeless
due to flooding...


75
00:08:29.826 --> 00:08:32.226
and acts of arson
in the ghettos.


76
00:08:32.428 --> 00:08:35.363
- A light post!
- We'll have electricity!


77
00:08:35.565 --> 00:08:37.726
The bigwigs in government
didn't joke around.


78
00:08:37.934 --> 00:08:40.869
Homeless? Off to City of God!

79
00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:45.131
There was no electricity,
paved streets or transportation.


80
00:08:45.341 --> 00:08:48.538
But for the rich and powerful
our problems didn't matter.


81
00:08:48.778 --> 00:08:51.747
We were too far removed...

82
00:08:51.948 --> 00:08:54.416
from the picture postcard image
of Rio de Janeiro.


83
00:09:11.134 --> 00:09:13.864
Do you think I can become
a lifeguard one day?


84
00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:15.901
I don't know.

85
00:09:16.105 --> 00:09:18.972
Being a lifeguard is better
than a fishmonger.


86
00:09:19.175 --> 00:09:21.700
I don't want to sell fish.
It stinks.


87
00:09:22.245 --> 00:09:24.611
- Are you insulting your father?
- No.


88
00:09:25.348 --> 00:09:28.317
So what do you want to be?

89
00:09:28.718 --> 00:09:30.345
I don't know.

90
00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:34.147
- Not a hood or a policeman.
- Why not?


91
00:09:34.357 --> 00:09:36.518
I'm scared of getting shot.

92
00:09:40.997 --> 00:09:43.465
Put that thing away, kid.
Are you nuts?


93
00:09:43.666 --> 00:09:47.158
Pointing that gun at me?

94
00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:50.601
Take it easy with the kid, Goose.
Li'l Dice is with me.


95
00:09:50.807 --> 00:09:53.640
Right, I'm a gangster too.

96
00:09:53.843 --> 00:09:56.471
- That gas truck didn't bring much.
- So what?


97
00:09:56.679 --> 00:10:00.308
- We rob gas trucks every day.
- One today, another tomorrow.


98
00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:02.811
No, we need to rob
some rich guy's house.


99
00:10:03.019 --> 00:10:05.453
That's the only
way to get outta here.


100
00:10:05.655 --> 00:10:08.954
Hell, no. What you need
is to follow my plan.


101
00:10:09.158 --> 00:10:10.591
That's it.

102
00:10:10.793 --> 00:10:14.889
The little fart's getting
too big for his britches!


103
00:10:20.837 --> 00:10:24.204
He gets high and starts
talking bullshit.


104
00:10:24.407 --> 00:10:29.572
You two junkies aren't worth
half as much as that kid.


105
00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:34.440
What you got in mind, Li'l Dice?

106
00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:39.246
To be a real hood you need
more than just a gun. You need ideas.


107
00:10:42.458 --> 00:10:44.551
And Li'l Dice had them.

108
00:10:45.728 --> 00:10:48.219
- Is that the motel?
- Yeah.


109
00:10:48.631 --> 00:10:53.364
We go in, grab the money and
get out. No killing, got that?


110
00:10:53.569 --> 00:10:56.902
- I need this.
- Don't touch my gun, kid.


111
00:10:57.106 --> 00:10:58.300
Don't ever do that again.

112
00:10:58.507 --> 00:11:00.099
- Don't point at me.
- Fuck you.


113
00:11:00.309 --> 00:11:03.972
- Don't point your finger at me!
- Stop acting like a baby!


114
00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:05.874
Here's yours.

115
00:11:06.082 --> 00:11:08.482
- Awesome!
- Let's go!


116
00:11:08.684 --> 00:11:11.209
- Not so fast!
- What?


117
00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:13.888
You stay here and keep watch.

118
00:11:14.156 --> 00:11:19.458
If the cops come, shoot that
window over there.


119
00:11:19.662 --> 00:11:22.563
- Why me? Let that dork do that.
- Look...


120
00:11:22.765 --> 00:11:27.964
I gave you this great plan, for free...
While that guy's absolutely useless!


121
00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:29.933
- You just had the idea.
- Exactly!


122
00:11:30.139 --> 00:11:32.630
You're just a kid, remember?

123
00:11:33.242 --> 00:11:35.972
You cover us, okay?

124
00:11:36.979 --> 00:11:41.746
You'll get your turn, so cool it.
Stop trying to rush things.


125
00:11:41.951 --> 00:11:44.442
You stay there.

126
00:11:48.257 --> 00:11:51.385
This is a hold-up, bitch.

127
00:11:54.497 --> 00:12:01.164
You should be studying or working.
You don't even look like hoodlums.


128
00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:05.363
Instead, you ought to be
working or studying, boy.


129
00:12:05.574 --> 00:12:08.441
Shut up!
What a pain in the ass!


130
00:12:09.412 --> 00:12:11.175
Okay, Clipper?

131
00:12:13.215 --> 00:12:14.614
Shall we go in?

132
00:12:19.956 --> 00:12:22.220
I didn't order anything.

133
00:12:22.425 --> 00:12:26.555
It's on the house, sir.
Hand over the money!


134
00:12:26.762 --> 00:12:29.026
Keep calm, all I want
is your cash.


135
00:12:29.231 --> 00:12:30.823
- Don't point that...
- Your wallet...


136
00:12:43.245 --> 00:12:44.769
Hey, man...

137
00:12:44.981 --> 00:12:47.176
What kind of whorehouse is this?

138
00:12:50.419 --> 00:12:52.979
- You from the church?
- Yes, brother.


139
00:12:56.058 --> 00:12:57.047
Give it to me!

140
00:12:59.261 --> 00:13:00.558
Slut!

141
00:13:00.796 --> 00:13:02.593
You're old, fat and flabby!

142
00:13:03.566 --> 00:13:05.864
Wanna take her place?

143
00:13:10.339 --> 00:13:12.500
What's going on?

144
00:13:13.642 --> 00:13:16.338
- The cops! Let's beat it!
- Let's go!


145
00:13:21.484 --> 00:13:24.976
Take that car.
I'll go get Li'l Dice.


146
00:13:26.355 --> 00:13:28.789
Jesus, what a car!

147
00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:39.531
- Something fucked up. Li'l Dice's gone.
- The cops are shooting, let's go!


148
00:14:06.562 --> 00:14:08.962
Slow down! Hold on...

149
00:14:09.165 --> 00:14:11.998
- You said you knew how to drive.
- I do, so cool it!


150
00:14:12.201 --> 00:14:14.897
Turn! Watch out!

151
00:14:28.517 --> 00:14:30.280
You fucking asshole!

152
00:14:31.353 --> 00:14:34.049
Hey, I didn't do it on purpose.

153
00:14:34.256 --> 00:14:37.885
No one saw anything.
So keep your mouths shut, understand?


154
00:14:41.664 --> 00:14:44.565
Hold on, I twisted my ankle.

155
00:14:44.767 --> 00:14:47.099
Goose fucked up his ankle.

156
00:14:47.303 --> 00:14:48.292
It fucking hurts.

157
00:14:48.504 --> 00:14:52.406
Take him into the woods.
I'll shoot to distract the cops.


158
00:14:52.608 --> 00:14:54.940
- In God we trust.
- In God we trust.


159
00:14:59.849 --> 00:15:02.113
Pass me the telephone, Penguin.

160
00:15:02.318 --> 00:15:06.220
Shorty is another notorious guy
in the City of God.


161
00:15:06.422 --> 00:15:08.447
But it's not yet time
to tell his story.


162
00:15:10.325 --> 00:15:14.352
- It fucking hurts, Goose.
- Shut up.


163
00:15:15.064 --> 00:15:19.797
- Wait up...
- You sound like a damn sissy, man.


164
00:15:23.872 --> 00:15:27.137
- Give me your hand! Climb up!
- No one saw anything?


165
00:15:27.342 --> 00:15:32.177
How odd! A car crashes
into a bar and no one saw a thing.


166
00:15:32.381 --> 00:15:35.373
I suppose you didn't see
anything either?


167
00:15:35.584 --> 00:15:39.315
As usual, no one saw,
no one knows.


168
00:15:40.055 --> 00:15:43.513
So what's up, Shorty?

169
00:15:44.193 --> 00:15:46.957
They're hiding in the woods.

170
00:15:47.963 --> 00:15:49.624
- Hello, Melonhead.
- How are you doing?


171
00:15:49.832 --> 00:15:53.268
I have this feeling that
they're out in the woods.


172
00:15:53.502 --> 00:15:57.063
- The motherfuckers.
- They're out in the woods.


173
00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:01.003
Felipe, lock up the car.
Rangel, come with me.


174
00:16:05.414 --> 00:16:08.679
I can't see a thing.
How the hell can they see?


175
00:16:08.884 --> 00:16:11.318
Fucking jungle.

176
00:16:15.591 --> 00:16:19.652
- They stole a fortune at that motel.
- I know.


177
00:16:21.997 --> 00:16:24.659
What if we took the money?

178
00:16:25.167 --> 00:16:29.331
Are you crazy?
I'm not getting mixed up in that.


179
00:16:29.538 --> 00:16:32.098
I want to exterminate these guys.

180
00:16:32.307 --> 00:16:36.607
What? Since when is stealing from
niggers and thieves a crime?


181
00:16:36.945 --> 00:16:43.612
It won't be hard to nab them.
I have a stoolie in the City.


182
00:17:08.477 --> 00:17:15.144
- Did you hear those shots?
- If I catch one of them, I'll kill him.


183
00:17:26.895 --> 00:17:28.419
Maracana!

184
00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:30.925
Open the door.

185
00:17:33.202 --> 00:17:36.933
- What's the matter?
- The cops are after me.


186
00:17:45.314 --> 00:17:46.713
Shaggy!

187
00:17:47.916 --> 00:17:50.783
- Shaggy!
- The cops are on my ass!


188
00:17:50.986 --> 00:17:54.217
- Hide me!
- Quick, come in.


189
00:18:02.064 --> 00:18:06.398
Shit... I thought the cops
would be down there all night.


190
00:18:07.736 --> 00:18:10.637
I had a vision, Goose.

191
00:18:11.373 --> 00:18:14.103
You been smoking something?

192
00:18:14.443 --> 00:18:17.276
- You've had a job, right?
- Yeah.


193
00:18:17.479 --> 00:18:19.538
What's it like?
What do people say?


194
00:18:19.748 --> 00:18:21.875
I worked with my father.

195
00:18:22.084 --> 00:18:25.645
And fathers talk a lot of shit.

196
00:18:26.888 --> 00:18:30.915
You know what, Goose?
I'm getting out, I don't want to die.


197
00:18:31.126 --> 00:18:36.530
- This gangster's life isn't for me.
- Wait! The cops are still down there.


198
00:18:36.732 --> 00:18:39.394
I don't give a shit.

199
00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:44.232
I'm going back to the church.

200
00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:46.933
He that dwells in the secret
place of the most High...


201
00:18:47.142 --> 00:18:50.509
shall abide under the shadow of
the Almighty. I will say of the Lord...


202
00:18:50.712 --> 00:18:54.978
He is my refuge and my fortress,
in Him will I trust.


203
00:18:55.183 --> 00:18:58.414
Fear not the terror by night,
nor the arrow that flies by day...


204
00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:02.647
nor the pestilence that walks
in darkness, nor the destruction...


205
00:19:02.858 --> 00:19:06.726
- Stop, motherfucker!
- Don't move!


206
00:19:07.062 --> 00:19:10.498
Stop, or l'll shoot!

207
00:19:12.134 --> 00:19:17.162
...shall abide under the shadow
of the Almighty.


208
00:19:17.372 --> 00:19:22.139
The hold-up at the motel went down
as the bloodiest in history.


209
00:19:22.344 --> 00:19:25.177
The destinies of the outlaws
then took different paths.


210
00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:28.816
I don't think this guy
was involved in the heist.


211
00:19:29.017 --> 00:19:30.712
See here?

212
00:19:30.919 --> 00:19:36.323
- He's a worker, not a hoodlum.
- I'll make him one now.


213
00:19:39.594 --> 00:19:43.894
Destiny put Clipper
back into the hands of God.


214
00:19:45.434 --> 00:19:49.598
Shaggy was in Bernice's hands.

215
00:19:51.239 --> 00:19:54.766
And Goose was
in my father's hands.


216
00:19:54.976 --> 00:19:58.468
Why do you do these things?
You think l'm a fool?


217
00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:01.376
From now on,
you'll work with me.


218
00:20:01.583 --> 00:20:05.747
Your younger brother
will keep an eye on you.


219
00:20:05.954 --> 00:20:07.945
You listen to me.

220
00:20:08.156 --> 00:20:12.525
If I catch you with money that
isn't yours, I'll kill you.


221
00:20:12.728 --> 00:20:18.598
That goes for you too. Get changed!
You start work immediately.


222
00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:24.568
Having a hood as a brother sucks.
You always end up footing the bill.


223
00:20:24.773 --> 00:20:29.039
Don't worry.
Dad's mad at me...


224
00:20:29.244 --> 00:20:33.647
but he'll get over it.

225
00:20:36.785 --> 00:20:40.846
Give me that, Rocket. It's not
for you. You have to study.


226
00:20:41.056 --> 00:20:44.389
- Getting shot doesn't scare you?
- I'm a hood because I got no brain.


227
00:20:44.593 --> 00:20:48.427
But you're smart.
You should study.


228
00:20:48.930 --> 00:20:52.229
I go to school because
I don't like physical work.


229
00:20:52.768 --> 00:20:57.364
Promise me something... That you'll
never touch this gun. Promise?


230
00:20:58.106 --> 00:21:00.165
Let's shake.

231
00:21:01.676 --> 00:21:04.236
We'd better hurry.

232
00:21:05.514 --> 00:21:09.041
I'm gonna sell a lot of fish.
And don't laugh.


233
00:21:09.251 --> 00:21:11.014
You grinned when I got slapped.

234
00:21:11.219 --> 00:21:13.119
- Who, me?
- I saw you.


235
00:21:41.082 --> 00:21:44.574
What is it, Shaggy?
Cat got your tongue?


236
00:21:44.786 --> 00:21:47.380
Your fidgeting behind me
makes me nervous.


237
00:21:47.589 --> 00:21:51.753
- I'm thinking of what to say to you.
- You're thinking, as well?


238
00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:54.292
Don't. It'll be your downfall.

239
00:21:54.496 --> 00:21:58.762
My heart has chosen you.
And I follow my heart.


240
00:21:58.967 --> 00:22:01.401
Are you pulling my leg?

241
00:22:01.603 --> 00:22:04.766
You never heard of
love at first sight?


242
00:22:05.407 --> 00:22:10.401
- Hoods don't love, they desire.
- You cut down everything I say.


243
00:22:10.612 --> 00:22:14.309
Hoods don't talk,
they smooth-talk.


244
00:22:14.516 --> 00:22:17.849
Well, l'll stop wasting
my breath on you.


245
00:22:18.053 --> 00:22:21.580
Hoods don't stop,
they take a break.


246
00:22:22.591 --> 00:22:25.082
Talking to you about love
sure is complicated.


247
00:22:25.293 --> 00:22:28.820
It's not love,
it's a con game.


248
00:22:45.113 --> 00:22:47.547
It's just that I love you.

249
00:22:48.583 --> 00:22:52.178
You just might end up
convincing me...


250
00:23:14.175 --> 00:23:19.169
After the hold-up, there were
constant police raids in the ghetto.


251
00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:30.685
Every day, someone went to jail,
someone was nailed.


252
00:23:32.527 --> 00:23:36.588
But no one had seen anything.
No one knew anything.


253
00:23:37.999 --> 00:23:43.369
No one blabbed to the cops about
where the thieves were hiding out.


254
00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:47.674
3 MONTHS LATER

255
00:23:47.876 --> 00:23:49.036
Shaggy...

256
00:23:49.244 --> 00:23:52.577
Why don't you change your life?

257
00:23:53.014 --> 00:23:56.745
Get a job instead of
lying around in bed all day.


258
00:23:56.952 --> 00:23:59.785
- Good-for-nothing!
- What do you mean?


259
00:23:59.988 --> 00:24:02.957
You think you can make money
working? Go ahead.


260
00:24:03.625 --> 00:24:08.028
That's right, Shaggy...
what do you think I do all day?


261
00:24:10.966 --> 00:24:17.098
Take it easy, baby... you know all
I want is to be with you, have kids...


262
00:24:17.305 --> 00:24:21.867
and a farm, raise chickens,
grow pot and get high.


263
00:24:22.077 --> 00:24:25.945
Sure! For me, that's
nothing but smooth-talk.


264
00:24:35.857 --> 00:24:40.123
What? I almost got
rich with that motel job.


265
00:24:40.328 --> 00:24:41.317
Are you kidding?

266
00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:46.096
The cops are still looking for you
because of the deaths in the motel.


267
00:24:47.569 --> 00:24:50.436
What deaths?
What are you talking about?


268
00:24:50.639 --> 00:24:54.097
Did you see anything?
You don't know shit, so shut up.


269
00:24:54.309 --> 00:24:57.437
You weren't there.
I didn't kill anyone.


270
00:24:57.646 --> 00:25:01.343
I bet it's those fucking policemen,
and l'm the one taking the rap.


271
00:25:01.549 --> 00:25:05.178
They even nabbed Li'l Dice.
So don't bring it up again!


272
00:25:06.655 --> 00:25:09.453
- I don't care who did it.
- It wasn't me.


273
00:25:09.658 --> 00:25:13.924
Let me just say... I don't want my
kid's father to be a hoodlum.


274
00:25:14.129 --> 00:25:15.528
You're all alone, Shaggy.

275
00:25:15.730 --> 00:25:17.630
- All alone?
- That's right!


276
00:25:17.832 --> 00:25:19.629
- Clipper's gone religious.
- Hallelujah!


277
00:25:19.834 --> 00:25:21.529
- Goose is working.
- Ass-kisser!


278
00:25:21.736 --> 00:25:23.863
- And you?
- I haven't changed. So what?


279
00:25:24.072 --> 00:25:28.372
They've deserted me,
that's all.


280
00:25:28.576 --> 00:25:30.737
Then l'm deserting you too.

281
00:25:30.945 --> 00:25:33.436
I'm splitting, Shaggy.
Come with me, if you want.


282
00:25:33.648 --> 00:25:37.516
Otherwise, l'll go alone.

283
00:25:51.566 --> 00:25:54.194
Fish for sale!

284
00:25:54.402 --> 00:25:57.371
My brother had promised
to stop messing around.


285
00:25:57.572 --> 00:26:04.034
But a hood doesn't stop,
a hood takes a break.


286
00:26:04.245 --> 00:26:07.544
Goose began messing around
with Shorty's wife.


287
00:26:08.016 --> 00:26:12.453
I have trout. But for special
customers like you...


288
00:26:12.654 --> 00:26:15.623
I also have a kisser fish.

289
00:26:15.824 --> 00:26:18.156
Hey, that's a mullet!

290
00:26:20.962 --> 00:26:22.793
Doesn't your husband...

291
00:26:22.997 --> 00:26:25.124
go down on you?

292
00:26:26.301 --> 00:26:27.825
No.

293
00:26:28.203 --> 00:26:31.366
Mine, before entering me,
has to use his tongue.


294
00:26:31.573 --> 00:26:36.237
For about half an hour.
And from behind? Do you let him?


295
00:26:36.444 --> 00:26:41.643
- Good God, no. Doesn't it hurt?
- The first few times.


296
00:26:41.850 --> 00:26:45.581
Then you'll see, it's fantastic.
But you need a banana.


297
00:26:45.787 --> 00:26:47.277
What for?

298
00:26:47.489 --> 00:26:50.481
You're missing the good things
in life, girl!


299
00:26:50.692 --> 00:26:53.593
You take a banana, warm it up...

300
00:26:53.795 --> 00:26:57.526
Put it up your thing, while he
takes you from behind.


301
00:26:57.732 --> 00:27:01.930
It's a real rush!
Ask your husband.


302
00:27:02.137 --> 00:27:06.904
I couldn't. You don't know him.
He's liable to beat me.


303
00:27:07.108 --> 00:27:10.805
Try him. Men go wild
for smut like that.


304
00:27:18.353 --> 00:27:20.753
Motherfucking nigger!

305
00:27:22.991 --> 00:27:25.323
Slut!

306
00:27:26.494 --> 00:27:28.894
Whoring bitch!

307
00:27:31.599 --> 00:27:35.865
Rocket, give me your shorts.
Quick!


308
00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:40.336
- Take them off, dammit!
- I'm not going naked in the street.


309
00:27:40.542 --> 00:27:44.410
You want your brother to die?
Give me your shorts. Now!


310
00:27:44.612 --> 00:27:46.443
Give me your shirt.

311
00:27:49.417 --> 00:27:51.385
Your shorts! Hurry up!

312
00:27:53.955 --> 00:27:58.221
I knew it. It's always me
who forks up for that bum.


313
00:28:06.267 --> 00:28:09.202
The bastard ran off.
That's his brother.


314
00:28:09.404 --> 00:28:11.599
- That brat there?
- I'll castrate that fucker.


315
00:28:14.042 --> 00:28:18.979
Fish! Fish for sale!

316
00:28:19.981 --> 00:28:22.643
Hey, kid, come over here.

317
00:28:23.551 --> 00:28:26.611
- Where's your brother?
- He's not working today.


318
00:28:26.821 --> 00:28:29.551
- Oh yeah? Get in.
- I didn't do anything.


319
00:28:29.757 --> 00:28:31.748
- Get in!
- What about my fish?


320
00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:35.088
- Hurry it up, kid!
- I don't want to lose my fish!


321
00:28:35.296 --> 00:28:39.255
- Forget your fish.
- Sit your ass down.


322
00:28:39.467 --> 00:28:43.267
- My father will kill me.
- That doesn't matter.


323
00:28:54.616 --> 00:28:56.811
Let's go.
There's nothing here.


324
00:28:57.018 --> 00:29:00.954
That day, my father swore he never
wanted to see my brother again.


325
00:29:01.155 --> 00:29:02.782
Let's go, Felipe.

326
00:29:05.994 --> 00:29:09.293
And he never did. No one ever
saw him in the ghetto again.


327
00:29:09.497 --> 00:29:12.955
The story of the Tender Trio
was coming to an end.


328
00:29:14.936 --> 00:29:20.101
Li'l Dice? Shit, man. I thought you
were a goner at the motel.


329
00:29:20.308 --> 00:29:26.975
- You're fucking loaded!
- Don't, Benny. That's our money.


330
00:29:27.582 --> 00:29:31.416
Fuck you. Cut the crap
and give me the money.


331
00:29:31.953 --> 00:29:36.447
Benny... Tell your brother Shaggy
that Shorty is squealing.


332
00:29:36.824 --> 00:29:41.386
- I'm leaving the ghetto.
- But Shorty had his hands full...


333
00:29:55.043 --> 00:29:57.443
Let's go see, Stringy.

334
00:30:06.821 --> 00:30:10.621
A neighbor called the police
before sunrise.


335
00:30:10.825 --> 00:30:13.589
The tabloids went to town:

336
00:30:13.795 --> 00:30:16.958
"Man Buries Wife Alive
in the City of God"


337
00:30:17.165 --> 00:30:20.032
Along with reporters, the place
was swarming with cops.


338
00:30:20.234 --> 00:30:24.170
The hoodlums took off.

339
00:30:25.773 --> 00:30:28.640
- You wanna die?
- It's you who's gonna die...


340
00:30:28.843 --> 00:30:32.973
if you don't do what I say.
And show the lady more respect.


341
00:30:35.483 --> 00:30:37.041
Let's go, dammit!

342
00:30:37.251 --> 00:30:39.981
- There are cops ahead.
- Fuck them, let's go.


343
00:30:40.188 --> 00:30:42.850
- Where to?
- Anywhere, just go.


344
00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:48.429
- What's the matter?
- Have mercy!


345
00:30:48.629 --> 00:30:51.564
- This car's a piece of junk.
- My ass! Start the damn thing!


346
00:30:51.766 --> 00:30:54.291
It needs a push.

347
00:30:55.636 --> 00:30:57.501
Push, Shaggy!

348
00:30:57.705 --> 00:30:59.195
Push!

349
00:31:12.487 --> 00:31:16.856
You?

350
00:31:17.525 --> 00:31:20.358
You want to arrest the thieves?
Over there...


351
00:31:20.561 --> 00:31:23.724
Nab that guy over there!

352
00:31:48.022 --> 00:31:50.115
Run, Shaggy!

353
00:31:50.324 --> 00:31:53.725
Stop the car!

354
00:32:35.136 --> 00:32:41.541
- This way! He's over here.
- We got that sonofabitch!


355
00:32:56.991 --> 00:32:59.482
- The bastard!
- He's a murderer.


356
00:32:59.694 --> 00:33:03.687
On the day Shaggy died
I remember the crowds...


357
00:33:03.898 --> 00:33:06.560
and a camera.

358
00:33:06.767 --> 00:33:10.032
I'd always wanted to have one.

359
00:33:11.772 --> 00:33:14.673
Let's go to school.

360
00:33:23.684 --> 00:33:25.652
- Well?
- Let's go to the beach.


361
00:33:25.853 --> 00:33:27.184
But we have an exam.

362
00:33:27.388 --> 00:33:31.051
So what?

363
00:33:31.259 --> 00:33:33.853
Everyone else is at the beach.

364
00:33:34.061 --> 00:33:37.053
Come on, let's go!

365
00:33:37.265 --> 00:33:40.666
She's in a bikini,
but doesn't want to go.


366
00:33:41.402 --> 00:33:45.771
What's that saying you have?

367
00:33:45.973 --> 00:33:49.136
The sun is for everyone. The beach,
for those who deserve it.


368
00:33:51.712 --> 00:33:54.010
THE SEVENTIES

369
00:33:54.215 --> 00:33:56.115
- Over here!
- I bought my first camera...


370
00:33:56.317 --> 00:34:00.583
when I was 16. Like all poor people,
I started at the bottom...


371
00:34:01.022 --> 00:34:03.490
with the world's cheapest model.

372
00:34:04.091 --> 00:34:07.390
So, Rocket?
How are things going?


373
00:34:07.595 --> 00:34:09.654
Any luck getting laid yet?

374
00:34:09.864 --> 00:34:11.957
Zilch.

375
00:34:13.232 --> 00:34:18.568
- Angelica. I was crazy about her.
- So, Rocket, still clicking away?


376
00:34:18.771 --> 00:34:22.969
She was gorgeous and the only
girl in our gang who screwed.


377
00:34:23.175 --> 00:34:25.166
I wanted to lose
my virginity with her.


378
00:34:25.377 --> 00:34:28.938
With her, buddy?
She's got a guy.


379
00:34:29.148 --> 00:34:32.379
- So? I'm not jealous.
- Her father's a sergeant.


380
00:34:32.585 --> 00:34:36.419
No one's perfect.
Closer together!


381
00:34:36.622 --> 00:34:38.886
I was the official
photographer of our gang.


382
00:34:39.925 --> 00:34:45.955
The gang of groovies. Everyone
paid to have copies of the pictures.


383
00:34:52.271 --> 00:34:55.468
Thiago, move back a little.

384
00:34:55.674 --> 00:34:58.472
- Is this okay?
- Perfect.


385
00:35:06.051 --> 00:35:08.451
I need a joint.

386
00:35:08.654 --> 00:35:13.421
Instead of smoking, man,
you should snort coke. It's far out.


387
00:35:13.626 --> 00:35:17.528
You snort, Thiago?
I prefer a good toke.


388
00:35:19.598 --> 00:35:22.863
If you like,
I can get it for you.


389
00:35:23.068 --> 00:35:27.698
You can? Then go on,
move your ass!


390
00:35:27.906 --> 00:35:31.672
But the choice stuff is coke.
That's a real nercotic.


391
00:35:31.877 --> 00:35:34.209
Narcotic!

392
00:35:36.515 --> 00:35:40.713
- Your mouth is all salty, Thiago.
- Screw you.


393
00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:43.515
You want to be
a lifeguard, Stringy?


394
00:35:43.722 --> 00:35:46.213
- You're never in the water.
- My dad's a lifeguard.


395
00:35:46.425 --> 00:35:50.361
- I'll bet you a beer I swim better.
- You're on.


396
00:35:53.165 --> 00:35:56.965
If you like, I can go get you
a joint at Blacky's.


397
00:36:10.015 --> 00:36:13.075
I'd have done anything
to please her...


398
00:36:14.219 --> 00:36:16.779
Buy her pot, coke...

399
00:36:20.993 --> 00:36:26.329
I could go to the top dogs to buy
quality stuff at a good price...


400
00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:33.868
because the local boss
was a former classmate: Blacky.


401
00:36:35.374 --> 00:36:38.070
- Who is it?
- Rocket.


402
00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:44.545
- How are things down there?
- Fine.


403
00:36:44.750 --> 00:36:46.843
- And the kids?
- Fine too.


404
00:36:47.052 --> 00:36:48.952
- You want to buy or smoke a joint?
- Buy.


405
00:36:49.154 --> 00:36:53.921
Come in, buddy.

406
00:36:55.494 --> 00:36:59.988
Who is it?

407
00:37:04.570 --> 00:37:06.970
This was Blacky's turf.

408
00:37:07.172 --> 00:37:10.767
But it hadn't always been his.

409
00:37:13.679 --> 00:37:15.772
- Hey, Blacky.
- Fuck, Li'l Dice.


410
00:37:15.981 --> 00:37:20.247
- You show up like this at my place?
- Who said it was your place?


411
00:37:21.754 --> 00:37:27.215
THE STORY OF THE APARTMENT
Dona Zelia began selling drugs here...


412
00:37:27.426 --> 00:37:31.419
when her husband died,
in order to raise her daughters.


413
00:37:31.630 --> 00:37:37.034
She also gave away drugs to boys at
times in return for special favors.


414
00:37:37.236 --> 00:37:42.936
Her favorite was "Big Boy".
One day, he grew very big!


415
00:37:43.142 --> 00:37:48.205
Zelia's operation was so amateur that
he had no trouble seizing it from her.


416
00:37:49.114 --> 00:37:53.608
Big Boy used the neighborhood
kids as dealers.


417
00:37:54.153 --> 00:37:58.522
- What about my pot?
- Stick it up your ass.


418
00:37:58.724 --> 00:38:01.488
The best dealer...

419
00:38:03.128 --> 00:38:05.961
...was Carrot.

420
00:38:06.165 --> 00:38:08.793
- Can I have a sip?
- Sure.


421
00:38:09.001 --> 00:38:11.629
He earned Big Boy's trust...

422
00:38:11.837 --> 00:38:14.829
was promoted, and moved up to
become a manager.


423
00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:18.703
Blacky, 20 for us and

424
00:38:20.245 --> 00:38:23.146
One day a buddy of Carrot's
showed up.


425
00:38:23.348 --> 00:38:29.287
- His name was Aristotle.
- My wife needs an operation.


426
00:38:29.488 --> 00:38:35.825
His family had taken Carrot in
when he was down and out.


427
00:38:36.028 --> 00:38:38.792
He couldn't refuse to help
a brother in need.


428
00:38:38.997 --> 00:38:43.434
Here's the dope. I want
the dough no later than Friday.


429
00:38:43.635 --> 00:38:46.468
- You've bailed me out, brother.
- Friday.


430
00:38:47.072 --> 00:38:50.906
He's my buddy, practically
my brother, Big Boy.


431
00:38:51.109 --> 00:38:55.102
Give him another week.

432
00:38:57.316 --> 00:39:01.844
- Either you kill him, or I'll kill you.
- Carrot had no choice.


433
00:39:03.522 --> 00:39:08.050
- I said Friday.
- Don't do it, man.


434
00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:11.855
Carrot wanted to kill Big Boy,
but it wasn't necessary.


435
00:39:12.297 --> 00:39:16.290
Big Boy hadn't paid off the cops.
He died in jail.


436
00:39:19.538 --> 00:39:23.065
Carrot took everything
that belonged to Big Boy...


437
00:39:23.275 --> 00:39:26.904
but didn't want the apartment...

438
00:39:27.112 --> 00:39:30.980
the place was ill-fated. Carrot gave it
to his most trusted dealer...


439
00:39:31.183 --> 00:39:33.913
- Here. 150 bags.
- Blacky.


440
00:39:34.119 --> 00:39:36.246
Give me more. This place
is crawling with druggies.


441
00:39:36.455 --> 00:39:39.720
That's how he took over
the local trade.


442
00:39:39.925 --> 00:39:42.189
But not for long...

443
00:39:43.395 --> 00:39:45.659
Who is it?

444
00:39:45.864 --> 00:39:47.729
Go see.

445
00:39:58.677 --> 00:40:00.668
- Hey, Blacky.
- Fuck, Li'l Dice.


446
00:40:00.879 --> 00:40:04.747
- You show up like this at my place?
- Who said it was your place?


447
00:40:04.950 --> 00:40:07.817
Yeah, who?

448
00:40:13.025 --> 00:40:14.925
- Something wrong, Li'l Dice?
- Li'l Dice, my ass.


449
00:40:15.127 --> 00:40:17.391
My name is Li'l Z' now.

450
00:40:17.596 --> 00:40:19.996
THE STORY OF Ll'L Z'

451
00:40:20.198 --> 00:40:23.224
Li'l Z' had always wanted
to be boss of the City of God...


452
00:40:23.435 --> 00:40:27.769
ever since he was little
and was called "Li'l Dice".


453
00:40:31.576 --> 00:40:34.841
They're having fun,
and not me?


454
00:40:44.690 --> 00:40:46.920
I want to get out of here.

455
00:40:47.726 --> 00:40:51.753
What, kid? Your friend took
everything. What do you want?


456
00:40:57.936 --> 00:41:01.201
That night, Li'I Dice
satisfied his thirst to kill...


457
00:41:01.406 --> 00:41:03.931
though he knew Shaggy would
never forgive him.


458
00:41:11.350 --> 00:41:15.616
To avoid being punished
he left the City of God.


459
00:41:16.822 --> 00:41:19.552
He had to work hard for peanuts.

460
00:41:24.663 --> 00:41:27.826
- Yeah, Benny!
- Li'l Dice and Benny managed well.


461
00:41:29.868 --> 00:41:31.631
They had the gift of crime.

462
00:41:31.837 --> 00:41:34.601
- You have more money than me.
- It was my idea.


463
00:41:34.806 --> 00:41:37.969
The only problem was running into
an older hoodlum...


464
00:41:38.176 --> 00:41:41.407
...like my brother, Goose.
- Li'l Dice?


465
00:41:41.613 --> 00:41:44.946
Shit, man. I thought
you were a goner at the motel.


466
00:41:45.150 --> 00:41:47.846
You're fucking loaded!

467
00:41:48.053 --> 00:41:51.716
Don't, Benny. That's our money.

468
00:41:52.257 --> 00:41:56.626
Benny, tell your brother Shaggy...

469
00:41:56.828 --> 00:42:01.356
that Shorty is squealing.
I'm leaving the ghetto.


470
00:42:03.935 --> 00:42:05.402
Goose!

471
00:42:07.806 --> 00:42:11.242
From Shaggy. You'll need it.

472
00:42:31.296 --> 00:42:33.924
From one hit to the next,
Li'l Dice grew up.


473
00:42:34.132 --> 00:42:38.535
At 18, he was the most
respected hood in the City of God.


474
00:42:38.737 --> 00:42:40.796
You're of age now, watch out!

475
00:42:41.006 --> 00:42:44.305
He was one of the most
wanted robbers in Rio.


476
00:42:57.589 --> 00:42:59.250
Li'l Dice, how's it going?

477
00:42:59.458 --> 00:43:03.087
Happy birthday.
I'm so glad you've turned 18...


478
00:43:03.295 --> 00:43:06.526
- Get lost, Tuba!
- Excuse me, amigo...


479
00:43:07.165 --> 00:43:09.224
Give me a beer!

480
00:43:09.434 --> 00:43:13.063
Didn't you see me, prick?

481
00:43:13.271 --> 00:43:15.136
- Sorry, man.
- Up yours!


482
00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:18.707
The next time,
l'll waste you, asshole!


483
00:43:20.112 --> 00:43:22.137
Fag!

484
00:43:22.481 --> 00:43:25.416
Li'I Dice was ready for anything.

485
00:43:25.617 --> 00:43:27.551
I wanna talk.

486
00:43:27.752 --> 00:43:30.744
- And he was itching to start.
- Who are the fattest cats here?


487
00:43:31.189 --> 00:43:35.421
- There are tons of them.
- Look at Jerry Adriani...


488
00:43:35.627 --> 00:43:39.723
gold chain, snazzy clothes.

489
00:43:39.931 --> 00:43:42.126
Look at Pereira
and the chick he's with...


490
00:43:42.334 --> 00:43:46.202
- Bernice. She was my brother's girl.
- Check out his car.


491
00:43:46.805 --> 00:43:50.935
Then there's Blacky.
Covered in gold.


492
00:43:51.143 --> 00:43:53.805
Gold chain, gold watch...

493
00:43:54.012 --> 00:43:57.175
Look at Carrot, and his car.

494
00:43:57.382 --> 00:44:01.113
- They're all dealers.
- They're all fucking loaded.


495
00:44:01.319 --> 00:44:03.344
Hold-ups bring in chickenshit.

496
00:44:03.555 --> 00:44:06.353
- The big bucks are in drugs.
- I see.


497
00:44:06.558 --> 00:44:08.549
Especially in selling coke.

498
00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:11.024
- But you need money.
- Not really...


499
00:44:11.229 --> 00:44:14.926
We'll kill these clowns
and take over their business.


500
00:44:15.133 --> 00:44:17.897
- When do we start?
- Now.


501
00:44:27.412 --> 00:44:31.371
Exu-the-Devil is the light
that shines forth.


502
00:44:31.583 --> 00:44:34.177
He brought you here.

503
00:44:34.386 --> 00:44:39.585
Why remain in the City of God
where God has forgotten you?


504
00:44:40.458 --> 00:44:44.861
I know what you want.
You want power.


505
00:44:45.063 --> 00:44:49.193
I have something which will
give it to you.


506
00:44:50.735 --> 00:44:55.229
To change your fate,
I give you my protector, boy.


507
00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:59.035
But you mustn't fornicate
with the amulet...


508
00:44:59.244 --> 00:45:01.712
otherwise...

509
00:45:02.781 --> 00:45:05.181
you'll die.

510
00:45:05.684 --> 00:45:08.084
The boy is no longer called
Li'l Dice...


511
00:45:08.286 --> 00:45:10.277
but Li'l Z'.

512
00:45:10.488 --> 00:45:14.049
Li'l Z' will grow up.

513
00:45:14.359 --> 00:45:18.159
You stick with me,
l'll stick with you.


514
00:45:29.441 --> 00:45:32.899
Li'l Dice became Li'I Z'
and he began to kill.


515
00:45:33.945 --> 00:45:40.612
He started one morning,
taking over Jerry Adriani's racket.


516
00:45:41.820 --> 00:45:46.189
By that night, almost all
of the rackets in the ghetto were his.


517
00:45:46.391 --> 00:45:49.792
The only business he didn't
touch was Carrot's...


518
00:45:49.995 --> 00:45:53.954
since he was a friend of Benny's.
All that was left was the apartment...


519
00:45:54.165 --> 00:45:55.223
But that would be easy.

520
00:46:00.005 --> 00:46:03.065
Who is it?

521
00:46:09.814 --> 00:46:11.679
- Hey, Blacky.
- Fuck, Li'l Dice.


522
00:46:11.883 --> 00:46:18.015
- You show up like this at my place?
- Who said it was your place?


523
00:46:18.223 --> 00:46:19.850
- Something wrong, Li'l Dice?
- Li'l Dice, my ass.


524
00:46:20.058 --> 00:46:23.516
- My name is Li'l Z' now.
- His name's Li'l Z', see?


525
00:46:23.728 --> 00:46:26.856
- You're a goner, bastard.
- Don't kill him. He understands.


526
00:46:27.065 --> 00:46:29.192
Right, Blacky?

527
00:46:29.401 --> 00:46:33.929
It's all yours, I don't want anything.
I don't want no trouble, okay?


528
00:46:34.139 --> 00:46:37.267
I should have taken this chance
to avenge my brother's death.


529
00:46:39.144 --> 00:46:43.843
You'll live, but you'll
work for us. Understand?


530
00:46:44.049 --> 00:46:46.142
That's easy to say...

531
00:46:47.485 --> 00:46:50.682
- Where are you going?
- He's clean, Li'l Z'.


532
00:46:51.256 --> 00:46:52.689
What's your name, kid?

533
00:46:52.891 --> 00:46:56.691
- Rocket.
- He's Goose's brother.


534
00:46:56.895 --> 00:46:59.489
- Goose?
- The late Goose.


535
00:47:00.699 --> 00:47:02.963
Quick, kid. Run along.

536
00:47:03.168 --> 00:47:07.628
Tell everyone that this business
now belongs to Li'l Z'.


537
00:47:07.839 --> 00:47:11.741
And that we'll be selling coke.
Got that?


538
00:47:12.110 --> 00:47:13.839
Cocaine.

539
00:47:16.848 --> 00:47:19.783
- Where's the turf?
- Over there, on the left.


540
00:47:19.984 --> 00:47:23.010
Selling drugs is like any
other business.


541
00:47:23.355 --> 00:47:25.255
The supplier
delivers the merchandise...


542
00:47:25.457 --> 00:47:28.187
which is then
packaged on the premises.


543
00:47:28.526 --> 00:47:32.326
It's done in an assembly line.

544
00:47:32.530 --> 00:47:34.589
Boring as hell...

545
00:47:35.066 --> 00:47:39.093
Pot is wrapped up in "lids".

546
00:47:39.371 --> 00:47:42.067
Cocaine is put into packets...

547
00:47:42.807 --> 00:47:47.039
and then into bundles
of 10 or 100.


548
00:47:47.412 --> 00:47:50.279
You can even make a career
in dealing drugs.


549
00:47:50.482 --> 00:47:54.316
The kids start out
as delivery boys.


550
00:47:54.586 --> 00:47:58.579
They're paid to run errands
and take messages.


551
00:47:59.324 --> 00:48:02.316
Then they become lookouts.
If the police arrive...


552
00:48:02.527 --> 00:48:05.360
the kites disappear
and everyone scrams.


553
00:48:06.631 --> 00:48:10.226
Later, you become a dealer
or a "vapor".


554
00:48:10.435 --> 00:48:13.529
When the heat's on, the
"vapor" quickly evaporates.


555
00:48:13.738 --> 00:48:17.868
Moving up the ladder,
you have the "soldier".


556
00:48:18.109 --> 00:48:21.704
And if the guy is good at math,
he can become a manager...


557
00:48:21.913 --> 00:48:25.371
the boss' right-hand man.

558
00:48:26.818 --> 00:48:30.754
The police receive their part
and don't make trouble.


559
00:48:32.957 --> 00:48:35.551
Since Li'l Z' killed off
all of his enemies...


560
00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:40.720
there were no shoot-outs in the
City of God. You could drive there...


561
00:48:41.099 --> 00:48:44.626
The playboys felt safe
buying their drugs there.


562
00:48:46.070 --> 00:48:50.734
The City teemed with addicts
and Li'l Z' grew rich.


563
00:48:51.676 --> 00:48:53.974
- Is it okay?
- It's a deal.


564
00:48:57.649 --> 00:49:01.676
- I can't decide which to wear.
- This one's cool.


565
00:49:02.520 --> 00:49:06.889
If dealing were legal, Li'l Z'
would have been man of the year.


566
00:49:10.161 --> 00:49:13.096
But things were risky for me.
I was afraid of him.


567
00:49:13.298 --> 00:49:17.496
- And he was everywhere.
- What a drag this guy is.


568
00:49:17.702 --> 00:49:22.833
Whenever I wanted to smoke a joint
I had to go see Carrot.


569
00:49:27.445 --> 00:49:30.346
Half a lid. Thanks.

570
00:49:31.483 --> 00:49:35.647
But it was worth it.
I only smoked with Angelica.


571
00:49:37.322 --> 00:49:40.189
She and Thiago had split up,
so I made my move.


572
00:49:40.391 --> 00:49:46.193
- I was about to win her over...
- These pictures are really great.


573
00:49:46.397 --> 00:49:49.992
- You think so?
- I look good here.


574
00:49:50.201 --> 00:49:52.965
- You look beautiful everywhere.
- I'm serious.


575
00:49:53.171 --> 00:49:54.160
Me too.

576
00:49:57.075 --> 00:50:02.308
A setting sun,
a deserted beach... a long kiss...


577
00:50:02.514 --> 00:50:05.347
I was sure this was it...

578
00:50:06.050 --> 00:50:08.541
But the Runts arrived.

579
00:50:09.120 --> 00:50:12.385
Can I have a toke?

580
00:50:17.962 --> 00:50:19.156
Here.

581
00:50:19.364 --> 00:50:23.562
I'm going. See you later.

582
00:50:25.436 --> 00:50:28.735
Hold on, Angelica.

583
00:50:28.940 --> 00:50:31.431
- Your joint, man.
- Keep it.


584
00:50:31.643 --> 00:50:33.975
What a cool guy.

585
00:50:36.948 --> 00:50:41.317
That was my first run
in with the Runts.


586
00:50:47.190 --> 00:50:50.250
- Steak and fries, Benny.
- Great! Here...


587
00:50:53.764 --> 00:50:59.703
- A tip for you.
- Really? Thanks.


588
00:50:59.903 --> 00:51:02.201
- Wanna eat something?
- No.


589
00:51:05.409 --> 00:51:09.607
- Wanna trade this watch?
- After Angelica left him...


590
00:51:09.813 --> 00:51:11.713
Thiago began snorting
more and more.


591
00:51:11.915 --> 00:51:15.009
- Is it your grandfather's?
- No, my dad's.


592
00:51:15.218 --> 00:51:19.518
When a guy is really hooked
he ends up in the hands of the dealer.


593
00:51:19.723 --> 00:51:21.850
- Two bags of ten.
- One of ten.


594
00:51:22.059 --> 00:51:26.155
- Okay, one bag.
- For Thiago, it was different.


595
00:51:26.363 --> 00:51:29.855
- Watch out!
- Sorry, godfather.


596
00:51:30.233 --> 00:51:33.031
Godfather, my ass.
Did I baptize your kids?


597
00:51:33.236 --> 00:51:36.262
- I'm sorry.
- Now beat it.


598
00:51:38.875 --> 00:51:42.868
Blacky, lend me your bike.

599
00:52:06.336 --> 00:52:08.600
Hey, wanna race?

600
00:52:08.805 --> 00:52:12.263
- Where to?
- Up to the highway.


601
00:52:12.876 --> 00:52:15.811
- Okay.
- Ready? Go!


602
00:52:38.201 --> 00:52:42.035
- Pretty tough, wasn't it?
- Yeah, you're good.


603
00:52:42.239 --> 00:52:44.571
Where'd you buy those sneakers?

604
00:52:44.774 --> 00:52:47.368
- Not far from here.
- The shirt, as well?


605
00:52:47.577 --> 00:52:49.909
- No, uptown.
- Cool.


606
00:52:50.113 --> 00:52:52.343
It's a designer shirt.

607
00:52:52.549 --> 00:52:54.881
If I give you money
can you buy me one?


608
00:52:55.085 --> 00:52:57.747
Shorts and a shirt?

609
00:52:59.990 --> 00:53:02.288
Buy whatever you can.

610
00:53:04.961 --> 00:53:07.020
- What size are you?
- Measure me.


611
00:53:07.230 --> 00:53:10.165
- With what, man?
- Shit, with your hand.


612
00:53:11.668 --> 00:53:14.398
Shoe size? Turn around.

613
00:53:23.180 --> 00:53:28.140
- Hey, Benny!
- You got the digs?


614
00:53:31.154 --> 00:53:34.419
- Just one pair of pants?
- No, there's more.


615
00:53:39.563 --> 00:53:40.825
- You like it?
- Yeah.


616
00:53:42.098 --> 00:53:44.430
There's some change.

617
00:53:45.001 --> 00:53:47.936
- Keep it.
- Cool.


618
00:53:56.446 --> 00:53:59.040
This is Benny.

619
00:54:00.150 --> 00:54:03.745
- This is Rocket.
- Hi. I know him.


620
00:54:28.211 --> 00:54:30.873
I've become a playboy.

621
00:54:32.816 --> 00:54:36.946
Hey, gangsters, listen to this...

622
00:54:37.153 --> 00:54:38.984
Watch out...

623
00:54:39.189 --> 00:54:42.852
Groovies shake their asses
before laying a big one.


624
00:54:46.329 --> 00:54:48.058
Oh, yeah?

625
00:54:48.932 --> 00:54:51.628
Fuck off, you bastards!

626
00:54:53.970 --> 00:54:57.770
Making fun of me?

627
00:54:59.042 --> 00:55:01.237
Asshole!

628
00:55:16.159 --> 00:55:20.357
Benny, didn't I tell you to shoot Carrot?
He's endangering the ghetto.


629
00:55:20.563 --> 00:55:24.090
- Cool it. Go talk to him.
- I'm gonna kill that fucker.


630
00:55:24.301 --> 00:55:27.168
- Stop trying to wipe out everyone.
- I'm gonna kill him.


631
00:55:29.506 --> 00:55:32.498
Don't worry, Angelica.
The guys in here are cool.


632
00:55:32.709 --> 00:55:35.303
Sure, l'm not worried.

633
00:55:35.779 --> 00:55:39.613
You gonna dance, Benny?
What about Carrot?


634
00:55:39.816 --> 00:55:43.877
Go on, buddy. Go talk to the guy.

635
00:55:44.087 --> 00:55:47.648
Benny was the coolest hood
in the City of God.


636
00:55:47.857 --> 00:55:51.020
He gave away pot,
paid for drinks.


637
00:55:51.528 --> 00:55:54.622
Li'l Z' was the opposite.
He had one obsession:


638
00:55:54.831 --> 00:55:56.799
To be the boss of the ghetto.

639
00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:00.265
He wanted an excuse to take over
Carrot's racket.


640
00:56:00.470 --> 00:56:02.097
- Hey, Carrot.
- What's up?


641
00:56:02.305 --> 00:56:06.605
You shouldn't let the Runts
do hold-ups in the ghetto.


642
00:56:07.177 --> 00:56:09.975
You look after your section,
l'll look after mine.


643
00:56:10.180 --> 00:56:14.048
Got that? I'm gonna get a drink.

644
00:56:21.925 --> 00:56:26.828
- Hey, Rocket! How's it going?
- Great.


645
00:56:27.030 --> 00:56:30.090
- Hey, Benny!
- How's it going?


646
00:56:30.867 --> 00:56:33.836
- Hey, Thiago. How are you?
- Good.


647
00:56:34.904 --> 00:56:36.371
- May I?
- Sure...


648
00:56:36.573 --> 00:56:38.871
Wanna dance?

649
00:56:42.379 --> 00:56:45.837
- Is it okay at your place?
- No problem.


650
00:56:46.049 --> 00:56:49.712
My parents are out.
You'll be all alone with her.


651
00:56:49.919 --> 00:56:54.322
- You can lose your virginity tonight.
- Not so loud, man!


652
00:56:54.524 --> 00:56:56.253
Everyone will hear.

653
00:56:57.494 --> 00:56:59.894
- You're beautiful.
- Thank you.


654
00:57:00.096 --> 00:57:04.556
- Shit!
- Nothing's happening.


655
00:57:11.775 --> 00:57:16.075
Look, man, I know the Runts
are associated with you.


656
00:57:16.279 --> 00:57:19.942
Think I'm a sucker, you little brat?
You want to take my racket?


657
00:57:20.150 --> 00:57:24.348
I want to talk to you
because you're fucking useless.


658
00:57:24.554 --> 00:57:25.543
Get your hand away!

659
00:57:25.755 --> 00:57:28.781
The Runts are screwing up
our security, man.


660
00:57:28.992 --> 00:57:30.323
Give the baby his bottle.

661
00:57:30.527 --> 00:57:32.927
Carrot, just ask the kids
to cool it, okay?


662
00:57:33.129 --> 00:57:36.530
Carrot's useless. He lets the Runts
do hold-ups in his section.


663
00:57:36.733 --> 00:57:39.668
The police come around and
that's bad for business.


664
00:57:39.936 --> 00:57:43.531
I'll do it only because
I like you.


665
00:57:43.873 --> 00:57:45.534
But you need to change
that baby's diapers.


666
00:57:45.742 --> 00:57:49.576
I'll show you who's the baby...

667
00:57:49.779 --> 00:57:55.274
Tell the kids that in my ghetto
no one robs or rapes!


668
00:57:55.485 --> 00:57:56.952
No wonder you're "Little" Z'!

669
00:58:00.123 --> 00:58:05.060
The Runts were kids who didn't
respect the laws of the ghetto.


670
00:58:05.261 --> 00:58:08.719
They would mug residents,
hold up bakeries...


671
00:58:08.932 --> 00:58:11.127
especially in Carrot's section.

672
00:58:14.070 --> 00:58:17.631
What are you doing?

673
00:58:19.409 --> 00:58:23.903
- You rob me all the time!
- But they didn't know...


674
00:58:24.113 --> 00:58:26.445
that the City had a boss now.

675
00:58:28.318 --> 00:58:30.343
THANK YOU FOR CHOOSING US

676
00:58:30.553 --> 00:58:34.387
The City had become
much safer for residents.


677
00:58:35.725 --> 00:58:38.592
There were hardly
any hold-ups now.


678
00:58:38.828 --> 00:58:40.125
You just had to go see Li'l Z'.

679
00:58:40.330 --> 00:58:43.458
- Let's go.
- Don't hurt the Runts.


680
00:58:43.666 --> 00:58:46.567
I won't touch them.

681
00:58:50.240 --> 00:58:52.208
- Hi, Steak.
- How's it going, Li'l Z'?


682
00:58:52.408 --> 00:58:55.104
- Wanna take a walk, Steak?
- With you? Hold on...


683
00:58:57.547 --> 00:59:00.539
Mom, l'm going out with
my friends.


684
00:59:12.996 --> 00:59:15.658
That's the best chicken
I ever ate.


685
00:59:16.132 --> 00:59:20.193
- The old guy was scared shitless.
- Feeling sorry for him?


686
00:59:20.403 --> 00:59:23.429
You're crazy, man!

687
00:59:31.848 --> 00:59:34.715
Why not stick up
a bank or a supermarket?


688
00:59:34.918 --> 00:59:39.355
- Peanuts. Drugs are where it's at.
- Yeah, selling drugs.


689
00:59:39.556 --> 00:59:45.859
But you have to start out as a delivery
boy. You wanna be a delivery boy?


690
00:59:46.062 --> 00:59:51.295
It's a rip off.
It takes a long time to move up.


691
00:59:51.601 --> 00:59:55.935
You have to wait till an older guy
gets killed to move up.


692
00:59:56.172 --> 00:59:59.335
I don't wanna wait till some guy
croaks. I'm gonna do what Li'l Z' did.


693
00:59:59.542 --> 01:00:02.238
I'm gonna wipe them all out.

694
01:00:02.445 --> 01:00:05.278
Talking about me, kid?
The boss is here.


695
01:00:09.385 --> 01:00:10.943
Come back, you brat!

696
01:00:15.325 --> 01:00:21.992
- They're quick, those kids.
- They run fast.


697
01:00:23.232 --> 01:00:26.133
They're all gone except you.
Any others?


698
01:00:33.710 --> 01:00:36.372
You're gonna pay
for the ones that escaped.


699
01:00:36.579 --> 01:00:40.743
You choose. Shall I shoot you
in the hand or foot?


700
01:00:41.351 --> 01:00:43.251
Come on, choose!

701
01:00:43.453 --> 01:00:46.217
Hand or foot?

702
01:00:48.758 --> 01:00:51.488
Choose, for fuck's sake!

703
01:00:59.235 --> 01:01:02.363
- Hand.
- The little hand, eh?


704
01:01:11.247 --> 01:01:13.340
Cool.

705
01:01:14.617 --> 01:01:19.020
Hey, Steak'n'fries,
let's see what you're made of.


706
01:01:19.222 --> 01:01:22.555
Choose and then kill
one of them.


707
01:01:22.759 --> 01:01:26.559
- Leave it. I'll do it.
- Butt out, Tuba. This is for him.


708
01:01:29.399 --> 01:01:31.230
Go on, Steak.

709
01:01:31.434 --> 01:01:34.870
Go on, choose one and shoot.

710
01:01:35.071 --> 01:01:38.097
Come on, I haven't got all day.

711
01:01:38.307 --> 01:01:41.140
Kill one of them.

712
01:01:44.380 --> 01:01:47.474
Let's go, Steak.
I'm in a hurry.


713
01:01:47.684 --> 01:01:51.051
I wanna see what you're made of.

714
01:01:58.728 --> 01:02:02.061
Well done!

715
01:02:02.265 --> 01:02:03.493
You did it.

716
01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:09.500
- You're one of us. Give me five.
- Very good, Steak.


717
01:02:12.175 --> 01:02:18.842
Get up, brat. Go back
to your rat hole. Without limping!


718
01:02:19.682 --> 01:02:23.982
Tell your buddies that no one
robs in Li'l Z”s ghetto.


719
01:02:24.187 --> 01:02:26.951
Go now.
And no limping, okay?


720
01:02:29.258 --> 01:02:31.488
Cool, Li'l Z'.

721
01:02:44.073 --> 01:02:47.736
While Li'l Z' was winning
the respect of the residents...


722
01:02:48.211 --> 01:02:51.180
Benny was winning
Angelica's heart.


723
01:02:51.714 --> 01:02:56.344
As for me, I was still
a virgin, single and broke.


724
01:02:56.552 --> 01:02:58.816
I had no choice.

725
01:02:59.922 --> 01:03:02.857
SUCKER'S LIFE

726
01:03:03.059 --> 01:03:06.790
I had to take a job
in a supermarket.


727
01:03:06.996 --> 01:03:11.524
I worked long hours for chicken feed.
I wanted to be laid off...


728
01:03:11.734 --> 01:03:15.761
so I could buy a camera
with the severance pay.


729
01:03:16.973 --> 01:03:20.101
But things didn't
work out that way.


730
01:03:23.179 --> 01:03:25.841
- It's the guy on the beach.
- Hey, bro!


731
01:03:26.048 --> 01:03:28.744
- Still smoking good stuff?
- Yeah.


732
01:03:28.951 --> 01:03:30.612
That guy's too cool.

733
01:03:30.820 --> 01:03:33.380
Hey, kid. Come here.
Lift up your shirt.


734
01:03:38.394 --> 01:03:41.761
We give these ghetto kids a chance
and they don't appreciate it.


735
01:03:41.964 --> 01:03:45.456
- What about my severance pay?
- What severance pay?


736
01:03:45.668 --> 01:03:49.627
That fucking manager thought
I was part of the gang.


737
01:03:49.839 --> 01:03:55.004
You're fired for serious misconduct.
Get out. Immediately!


738
01:03:55.211 --> 01:03:58.669
I didn't get a single cent.

739
01:04:12.461 --> 01:04:14.622
It was like a message from God:

740
01:04:16.933 --> 01:04:20.767
"Honesty doesn't pay, sucker'."

741
01:04:20.970 --> 01:04:24.235
FLIRTING WITH CRIME

742
01:04:33.416 --> 01:04:37.147
The bus sure took a long time to come.
I should already be at work.


743
01:04:37.954 --> 01:04:41.355
Shit, hide that gun.
Are you nuts?


744
01:04:41.557 --> 01:04:43.218
It was Goose's.
It's broken anyway.


745
01:04:43.426 --> 01:04:46.486
It's not our fault, the company
runs few buses on this line.


746
01:04:46.729 --> 01:04:51.325
It's never anyone's fault.
It's always someone else's.


747
01:04:51.534 --> 01:04:55.493
But it's the workers who suffer.
And then, they make us squeeze!


748
01:04:55.705 --> 01:04:57.832
Have a nice evening, ma'am.

749
01:05:00.343 --> 01:05:02.709
I know that guy.

750
01:05:02.912 --> 01:05:05.005
He lives in the City.
He'll recognize us.


751
01:05:05.214 --> 01:05:07.808
So? He couldn't care less
if we take his boss' money.


752
01:05:08.017 --> 01:05:10.281
Okay. Let's go.

753
01:05:13.189 --> 01:05:16.647
Well, boys? Aren't you from
the City of God?


754
01:05:17.093 --> 01:05:18.390
Yeah.

755
01:05:18.594 --> 01:05:21.757
I'll let one of you through
without paying.


756
01:05:26.035 --> 01:05:30.165
You should study
so you can get out of the ghetto.


757
01:05:30.373 --> 01:05:33.240
It's too full of cops and
hoodlums.


758
01:05:33.442 --> 01:05:37.310
- Did you study?
- I was in school and in the army.


759
01:05:37.513 --> 01:05:40.676
I was the best marksman
in my barracks.


760
01:05:40.883 --> 01:05:43.408
This job was all
I could find afterwards.


761
01:05:43.619 --> 01:05:47.817
But I do karate.
If l'm hired somewhere...


762
01:05:48.024 --> 01:05:50.117
l'll leave the ghetto.

763
01:05:50.626 --> 01:05:55.086
- Do you fight, then?
- I'm for peace and love.


764
01:05:55.464 --> 01:05:56.931
But if I have to...

765
01:05:57.133 --> 01:05:59.931
He didn't know he would have to.

766
01:06:00.136 --> 01:06:03.697
But not yet, it's not time
to tell Knockout Ned's story.


767
01:06:04.273 --> 01:06:06.434
- We should be going.
- Let's go.


768
01:06:06.642 --> 01:06:07.631
- Good bye.
- Thanks.


769
01:06:08.010 --> 01:06:09.341
See you.

770
01:06:14.617 --> 01:06:17.347
I couldn't do it.
He was such a cool guy.


771
01:06:17.553 --> 01:06:20.716
Yeah, totally.
That's Gerson's brother.


772
01:06:21.590 --> 01:06:23.922
Let's go home.

773
01:06:26.062 --> 01:06:30.123
There's nothing here
except that bakery over there.


774
01:06:30.333 --> 01:06:35.202
- What will you say?
- I don't know. "This is a hold-up."


775
01:06:37.306 --> 01:06:38.898
Here's my number.

776
01:06:39.108 --> 01:06:41.303
- You like soul or groovy parties?
- Soul.


777
01:06:41.677 --> 01:06:43.440
That one didn't work either.

778
01:06:43.646 --> 01:06:46.979
The counter girl was just too foxy.
And she flirted with me.


779
01:06:47.183 --> 01:06:48.343
Will you call me?

780
01:06:49.585 --> 01:06:53.146
I couldn't pull a gun on her,
she was too sweet.


781
01:06:53.356 --> 01:06:55.153
Yeah, I agree.

782
01:07:02.164 --> 01:07:05.133
Excuse me. I'm lost.
How do I get to Barra?


783
01:07:05.334 --> 01:07:06.323
- To Barra?
- Yes.


784
01:07:06.535 --> 01:07:09.333
I thought: "Tough luck
for this guy from Sao Paulo."


785
01:07:09.538 --> 01:07:12.564
- In fact, we were going there.
- You're kidding.


786
01:07:14.210 --> 01:07:17.145
- You're a lifesaver.
- That's right.


787
01:07:17.913 --> 01:07:21.314
Because no guy from Sao Paulo
could ever be cool.


788
01:07:28.791 --> 01:07:32.022
- The body's over here.
- We found it, Chief.


789
01:07:32.228 --> 01:07:34.719
The forensic expert!

790
01:07:50.212 --> 01:07:52.305
- Not a pretty sight, eh?
- You said it.


791
01:07:52.515 --> 01:07:54.813
- What a great singer.
- You like him?


792
01:07:55.017 --> 01:08:00.353
- I love music. What about you?
- Tell me, do you also like pot?


793
01:08:03.659 --> 01:08:06.150
I can't say l've never tried it.

794
01:08:06.362 --> 01:08:09.490
The devil recognizes his own.

795
01:08:11.567 --> 01:08:14.161
- Do you have papers?
- I think so.


796
01:08:14.370 --> 01:08:16.804
I have some.

797
01:08:19.408 --> 01:08:22.172
I'd always been an ace
at rolling a joint.


798
01:08:22.378 --> 01:08:24.778
If l'd had the same skill
with girls...


799
01:08:25.581 --> 01:08:29.745
l'd never have lost so many chances
to lose my virginity.


800
01:08:31.854 --> 01:08:36.621
- For a Sao Paulo guy you're very cool.
- Thanks, bro.


801
01:08:36.826 --> 01:08:39.727
What did they use?

802
01:08:40.096 --> 01:08:44.123
A club or a rock.
And the child?


803
01:08:44.333 --> 01:08:47.268
- Untouched.
- Thank goodness.


804
01:08:47.736 --> 01:08:52.230
- How long ago?
- About four hours.


805
01:08:52.775 --> 01:08:55.437
- Can we take it away?
- Go ahead.


806
01:08:56.812 --> 01:09:00.748
The murderer has to be
from the City of God.


807
01:09:19.535 --> 01:09:24.063
You bastard!
You motherfucker!


808
01:09:24.773 --> 01:09:27.708
Did you have to kill
your chick in the ghetto?


809
01:09:27.910 --> 01:09:30.902
- The place is crawling with cops now!
- Come on, Li'l Z'.


810
01:09:31.113 --> 01:09:35.573
- Come on? Fuck you!
- I had to avenge my honor.


811
01:09:35.784 --> 01:09:39.276
Her family's turned me in.
You won't have any problems.


812
01:09:39.488 --> 01:09:42.980
The cops are everywhere because
of you. You're dead meat, asshole.


813
01:09:43.192 --> 01:09:46.059
Let up, Li'l Z'.
You've punished him enough.


814
01:09:46.262 --> 01:09:48.389
You know the law.

815
01:09:48.597 --> 01:09:51.259
Anyone who kills in my ghetto
has to die as an example.


816
01:09:51.467 --> 01:09:54.061
That was his business, Li'l Z'.

817
01:09:54.270 --> 01:09:56.864
Listen, you sonofabitch,
get outta the ghetto.


818
01:09:57.072 --> 01:09:59.165
You showed no respect, understand?

819
01:10:02.711 --> 01:10:04.008
You know what, Benny?

820
01:10:04.213 --> 01:10:07.774
You're too nice. If you raise
a snake, expect to get bitten.


821
01:10:07.983 --> 01:10:10.850
He wasn't worth shit.

822
01:10:11.253 --> 01:10:14.051
- A dirty traitor.
- Shut up, Tuba.


823
01:10:14.256 --> 01:10:16.622
I'm going for a walk
with my girl.


824
01:10:16.825 --> 01:10:21.990
Okay, be careful.
When things calm down...


825
01:10:22.198 --> 01:10:25.224
we'll get back to our business
with Carrot, okay?


826
01:10:30.172 --> 01:10:33.232
You need a girlfriend, Li'l Z'.

827
01:10:53.561 --> 01:10:55.791
Know what l'm thinking, Benny?

828
01:10:56.431 --> 01:10:58.922
That l'm so sexy?

829
01:10:59.134 --> 01:11:02.695
That too. But I mean,
you know what we could do?


830
01:11:02.904 --> 01:11:06.396
- Make love again.
- I'm serious.


831
01:11:07.041 --> 01:11:11.705
We could go away from here.
This violence sucks.


832
01:11:12.947 --> 01:11:14.312
Go where?

833
01:11:15.150 --> 01:11:17.050
To a farm.

834
01:11:18.753 --> 01:11:22.621
We're really hippies at heart,
aren't we?


835
01:11:24.025 --> 01:11:26.152
A farm?

836
01:11:29.531 --> 01:11:32.091
Peace and love?

837
01:11:51.953 --> 01:11:56.686
BENNY'S FAREWELL

838
01:12:05.366 --> 01:12:08.665
Benny was just too cool
to go on being a hoodlum.


839
01:12:08.870 --> 01:12:12.499
He succeeded in getting everybody
together for his good-bye party.


840
01:12:12.707 --> 01:12:14.004
The gangs...

841
01:12:15.610 --> 01:12:17.669
The soul crowd...

842
01:12:21.950 --> 01:12:27.616
- The religious crowd...
- One day, l'll go to church.


843
01:12:27.822 --> 01:12:29.756
The samba crowd...

844
01:12:33.428 --> 01:12:35.623
The groovy crowd...

845
01:12:38.433 --> 01:12:42.426
And Li'l Z', who had never
danced in his life.


846
01:13:02.290 --> 01:13:06.317
Want to dance with me?
Want to dance with me?


847
01:13:06.527 --> 01:13:08.927
- I didn't hear...
- Want to dance?


848
01:13:09.130 --> 01:13:12.224
No, thank you, l'm with someone.

849
01:13:26.848 --> 01:13:28.475
Hey, Rocket!

850
01:13:42.397 --> 01:13:45.833
Come, I want to talk
to you, buddy.


851
01:13:46.801 --> 01:13:49.861
- You can't just split with that chick.
- Why not?


852
01:13:50.071 --> 01:13:54.269
I'm gonna go live on a farm,
smoke pot, listen to rock.


853
01:13:54.475 --> 01:13:58.275
You wanna throw away everything
we've accomplished for that bitch?


854
01:13:58.913 --> 01:14:01.973
She's not a bitch, she's my girl.

855
01:14:02.183 --> 01:14:04.777
We'll take over Carrot's business,
it'll be yours.


856
01:14:04.986 --> 01:14:08.319
- Leave Carrot alone, he's a good guy.
- He's a motherfucker!


857
01:14:08.523 --> 01:14:11.822
See? Everyone's a motherfucker
to you. That's why l'm leaving.


858
01:14:12.026 --> 01:14:15.723
I'm your friend,
but l'm getting out.


859
01:14:15.930 --> 01:14:18.160
You got to understand,
I have to go.


860
01:14:19.300 --> 01:14:23.737
I love you, man,
but l've had enough.


861
01:15:22.964 --> 01:15:25.330
Motherfucker, let's see
if you have any balls.


862
01:15:25.533 --> 01:15:29.128
- What is this?
- You wanna die? Fuck off, bitch!


863
01:15:29.704 --> 01:15:32.867
Strip, nigger.
I wanna see your ass.


864
01:15:33.074 --> 01:15:37.443
Hurry up!
Take it all off! Now!


865
01:15:38.179 --> 01:15:41.205
I wanna see your ass.
Come on, faggot!


866
01:15:41.616 --> 01:15:44.210
Let's go, nigger!

867
01:15:54.195 --> 01:15:57.164
Show your ass to everyone!

868
01:15:57.765 --> 01:15:59.392
Please...

869
01:16:04.439 --> 01:16:06.999
- Strip, dammit!
- Hurry it up!


870
01:16:18.786 --> 01:16:22.153
What's up, Benny?
This camera for a bag of coke?


871
01:16:22.356 --> 01:16:26.986
- I don't deal anymore.
- C'mon, do it for me. You're my friend.


872
01:16:27.195 --> 01:16:29.857
- Is it stolen?
- It's okay, it's my dad's.


873
01:16:30.598 --> 01:16:32.589
Your dad's?

874
01:16:33.668 --> 01:16:38.901
- Give it to Li'l Z'.
- Rocket would love this camera.


875
01:16:43.044 --> 01:16:44.773
- Yeah, here.
- Great.


876
01:17:09.270 --> 01:17:11.636
Here I am!

877
01:17:11.839 --> 01:17:13.966
- You wanna be a photographer?
- Yeah.


878
01:17:14.375 --> 01:17:19.176
- Here's a present.
- Shit, dude! This is great!


879
01:17:19.947 --> 01:17:24.145
Now move your ass.
Shake it!


880
01:17:43.170 --> 01:17:46.196
You'll take some great pictures.

881
01:17:48.075 --> 01:17:50.043
Give me that.

882
01:17:55.283 --> 01:18:01.518
- Give me back the camera!
- No!


883
01:18:04.458 --> 01:18:11.125
What's your problem?
Are you crazy?


884
01:18:38.326 --> 01:18:41.887
They've killed Benny!

885
01:18:43.497 --> 01:18:48.434
Fuck! Call an ambulance!
Where's the motherfucker who did it?


886
01:18:49.236 --> 01:18:54.264
- Z', Benny is dead.
- No! Call a doctor!


887
01:18:59.814 --> 01:19:04.410
Get out of here, bitch!
It's your fault!


888
01:19:06.687 --> 01:19:08.814
Motherfucker!

889
01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:35.314
Where's Carrot?

890
01:19:35.516 --> 01:19:37.177
Blacky's here.

891
01:19:39.587 --> 01:19:42.147
He's in trouble.

892
01:19:44.225 --> 01:19:45.954
I'm fucked.

893
01:19:46.427 --> 01:19:48.418
- Why?
- I'm fucked.


894
01:19:48.629 --> 01:19:51.496
And you are too.
I think I killed Benny.


895
01:19:51.699 --> 01:19:53.826
Li'l Z' is coming
to take your place.


896
01:19:54.035 --> 01:19:56.299
We can get him,
he's in the dance hall.


897
01:19:56.504 --> 01:19:58.131
You killed Benny?

898
01:19:58.339 --> 01:20:01.866
I didn't mean to. He moved.
I was aiming at Li'l Z'.


899
01:20:02.076 --> 01:20:04.237
Come on, let's go.

900
01:20:04.445 --> 01:20:06.936
Blacky...

901
01:20:07.148 --> 01:20:09.776
You killed the coolest
hood in the City of God.


902
01:20:09.984 --> 01:20:12.248
Let's go get Li'l Z'.

903
01:20:20.227 --> 01:20:24.891
Carrot knew that without Benny only
a miracle could save his business.


904
01:20:25.099 --> 01:20:28.193
We're fucked, man.

905
01:20:37.778 --> 01:20:43.080
But what better place for a miracle to
happen than in the City of God?


906
01:20:46.721 --> 01:20:48.621
Look who's here.
My sugar babe.


907
01:20:48.823 --> 01:20:50.484
- Let me by.
- Gimme a kiss, girl.


908
01:20:50.691 --> 01:20:54.650
Let me by, please.
Have you seen what you look like?


909
01:20:56.697 --> 01:20:59.757
Come on, Li'l Z'.

910
01:21:08.242 --> 01:21:10.733
Hi, honey.
Everything okay, baby?


911
01:21:18.385 --> 01:21:25.052
The problem was simple. Li'l Z' was
ugly. Knockout Ned was handsome.


912
01:21:25.259 --> 01:21:31.323
Knockout Ned could get any girl.
Li'l Z' had to pay or use force.


913
01:21:31.999 --> 01:21:35.594
It was a duel between
the handsome good guy...


914
01:21:36.103 --> 01:21:37.968
and the ugly bad guy.

915
01:21:38.172 --> 01:21:40.732
- Let me go!
- Just enjoy it.


916
01:21:48.048 --> 01:21:53.509
There's no use fighting.
You're mine now.


917
01:21:57.758 --> 01:22:00.955
Hey, faggot, your broad's
really hot!


918
01:22:33.260 --> 01:22:35.558
I can't even look her in
the face now.


919
01:22:45.606 --> 01:22:49.042
Why didn't that fucker kill me?

920
01:22:53.147 --> 01:22:57.243
Hold on...
Why didn't I kill that fucker?


921
01:22:57.751 --> 01:22:59.616
Let's go back.

922
01:22:59.820 --> 01:23:02.618
- What about Carrot?
- We'll get back to him.


923
01:23:02.823 --> 01:23:04.051
You gonna kill him?

924
01:23:07.761 --> 01:23:11.822
Knockout Ned, your chick's a slut.
Come out, motherfucker!


925
01:23:12.032 --> 01:23:17.470
- Come out, you loser!
- Take it easy...


926
01:23:17.671 --> 01:23:21.801
l'm going out. Let me go.

927
01:23:35.256 --> 01:23:37.281
Gerson! Come back, son!

928
01:23:47.835 --> 01:23:51.703
This doesn't concern you, kid.
We're here for your brother.


929
01:23:51.906 --> 01:23:55.273
Let's talk, we can work it out.
My brother's a peaceful guy.


930
01:23:55.476 --> 01:23:58.673
Is he too good-looking
to come talk to me? Call him.


931
01:23:58.879 --> 01:24:00.141
He hasn't done anything.

932
01:24:00.714 --> 01:24:04.013
You know who I am?

933
01:24:04.218 --> 01:24:07.278
- Li'l Z', man.
- He's Li'l Z'.


934
01:24:07.888 --> 01:24:10.755
Call that motherfucker!

935
01:24:15.429 --> 01:24:18.296
Go on, man.

936
01:24:18.832 --> 01:24:21.096
Calm down, l'll call him.

937
01:24:54.702 --> 01:24:58.103
My arm! I hurt my arm.
Carrot will have to wait.


938
01:24:58.305 --> 01:25:00.637
That loser got what he deserved.

939
01:25:00.841 --> 01:25:02.832
Let's go!

940
01:25:26.567 --> 01:25:30.503
Gerson...

941
01:25:30.704 --> 01:25:34.299
That bastard killed my brother.

942
01:25:42.249 --> 01:25:45.013
I can't let that go.

943
01:26:00.234 --> 01:26:02.361
- Want a gun?
- My son...


944
01:26:02.569 --> 01:26:05.970
Calm down, mom.

945
01:26:06.807 --> 01:26:09.674
Please, mom...

946
01:26:18.485 --> 01:26:22.148
Do it right, asshole.

947
01:26:22.356 --> 01:26:26.087
- There's no other way.
- How'd I let that loser hit me?


948
01:26:26.293 --> 01:26:28.761
Shit, that's some hole.

949
01:26:58.492 --> 01:27:01.484
- It's as if we were brothers.
- Shut up.


950
01:27:01.695 --> 01:27:06.223
Both of us hurt in the arm.
You by one brother, me the other.


951
01:27:06.433 --> 01:27:10.233
It would be really funny
if we were brothers.


952
01:27:10.437 --> 01:27:16.535
That Knockout Ned's not bad, eh?
He came out of nowhere.


953
01:27:17.311 --> 01:27:20.940
Shut up, Tuba!
You're a fucking pain!


954
01:27:28.489 --> 01:27:32.653
It was as if the City of God
had suddenly found a hero.


955
01:27:32.860 --> 01:27:35.021
God bless you, son.

956
01:27:35.229 --> 01:27:38.494
That kid was just asking
to be killed.


957
01:27:38.699 --> 01:27:41.395
Well done.

958
01:27:41.602 --> 01:27:44.833
You did a good job.

959
01:27:45.038 --> 01:27:48.667
You'd better go hide.

960
01:27:51.278 --> 01:27:54.543
I thought Knockout Ned
would start a revolution here.


961
01:27:54.748 --> 01:27:57.512
But God had other plans.

962
01:27:57.818 --> 01:28:01.413
Steak,
where are all the dealers?


963
01:28:01.622 --> 01:28:04.887
They're hiding.
Li'l Z' is in a bad mood.


964
01:28:05.092 --> 01:28:08.823
They get us hooked and then
they go off and hide.


965
01:28:09.029 --> 01:28:12.260
Do me a favor. Go get some
nose candy for me.


966
01:28:12.466 --> 01:28:13.865
I'll try.

967
01:28:14.067 --> 01:28:17.525
Tell them it's for Thiago,
to keep my buzz going.


968
01:28:38.124 --> 01:28:43.494
Steak'n'fries,
go to Carrot's and tell him...


969
01:28:43.696 --> 01:28:49.066
Li'l Z' says that if you kill
Knockout, he'll leave you alone.


970
01:28:49.702 --> 01:28:52.569
Hey, Knockout Ned.
Did you hear that?


971
01:28:52.772 --> 01:28:55.434
Grab the kid!

972
01:28:57.610 --> 01:29:03.276
You heard the boy? If you don't
stick with us, you're dead.


973
01:29:03.483 --> 01:29:06.748
I think you should join us.
We'll be partners.


974
01:29:07.420 --> 01:29:10.355
Drugs aren't my thing.

975
01:29:10.557 --> 01:29:12.684
This is just something
between me and him.


976
01:29:12.892 --> 01:29:17.556
Those guys aren't worth shit.

977
01:29:17.764 --> 01:29:21.359
They'll do anything for power.

978
01:29:21.568 --> 01:29:23.900
Like that kid.

979
01:29:24.103 --> 01:29:28.233
They're all robots,
like this punk here.


980
01:29:28.441 --> 01:29:30.705
What's in your head, kid?

981
01:29:30.910 --> 01:29:33.344
Can't you see you're
wrecking your life...


982
01:29:33.546 --> 01:29:37.778
with that maniac and a bunch
of trigger-happy fools?


983
01:29:39.252 --> 01:29:45.919
- Are you crazy? You're just a kid.
- A kid? I smoke, snort...


984
01:29:46.125 --> 01:29:49.424
l've killed and robbed.
I'm a man.


985
01:29:49.629 --> 01:29:52.154
Shit, you have no idea!

986
01:29:52.365 --> 01:29:55.596
He's attached to his gang.
You should join up with us.


987
01:29:55.802 --> 01:30:00.671
- Shall we kill him?
- Steak, we're going to grind you.


988
01:30:02.275 --> 01:30:06.507
- Okay, I accept.
- Great!


989
01:30:06.713 --> 01:30:10.809
Tell your boss that Knockout Ned
and Carrot are now in command.


990
01:30:11.017 --> 01:30:17.217
But on one condition:
No killing of innocent people.


991
01:30:18.858 --> 01:30:21.452
I can't accept that, understand?

992
01:30:21.661 --> 01:30:26.325
Okay, no innocent people.

993
01:30:27.734 --> 01:30:32.671
Steak fucked up!

994
01:30:44.350 --> 01:30:46.944
- Have you a gun for me?
- No...


995
01:30:47.153 --> 01:30:50.554
but we can hold up
a gun store.


996
01:30:50.757 --> 01:30:52.816
That's no problem.

997
01:30:53.026 --> 01:30:56.621
I don't want to hold up anything.
I'm not a hoodlum.


998
01:30:56.829 --> 01:31:00.026
This is a personal affair
between me and him, okay?


999
01:31:00.700 --> 01:31:02.964
I'm not a hoodlum.

1000
01:31:05.338 --> 01:31:07.306
He raped your chick...

1001
01:31:07.507 --> 01:31:11.341
killed your uncle and brother,
gunned your house...


1002
01:31:11.544 --> 01:31:14.911
and you killed one of his guys.

1003
01:31:19.251 --> 01:31:22.880
If you're not a hood,
then get out.


1004
01:31:27.960 --> 01:31:32.397
THE STORY OF KNOCKOUT NED

1005
01:31:33.565 --> 01:31:36.056
This is a hold-up!

1006
01:31:44.109 --> 01:31:47.738
- The first time...
- Where are the revolvers?


1007
01:31:47.946 --> 01:31:51.575
...Knockout Ned saved a salesclerk
from being shot by Carrot.


1008
01:31:51.783 --> 01:31:56.186
We said no killing!

1009
01:31:56.388 --> 01:31:58.185
That's the rule.

1010
01:31:59.424 --> 01:32:04.657
We want the boss' money. Everyone
keep calm. Open the cash register!


1011
01:32:04.863 --> 01:32:07.764
You want us to go?
We do too.


1012
01:32:07.966 --> 01:32:10.400
So hurry up!

1013
01:32:11.637 --> 01:32:14.037
- Look at the ground!
- The second time...


1014
01:32:14.239 --> 01:32:16.173
Carrot saved
Knockout Ned's life.


1015
01:32:18.944 --> 01:32:22.072
Ned learned that there's
an exception to every rule.


1016
01:32:22.714 --> 01:32:25.046
Exception to the rule.

1017
01:32:25.250 --> 01:32:28.344
- Are you the manager?
- Yes.


1018
01:32:28.553 --> 01:32:32.546
This is a hold-up.
Everyone on the ground!


1019
01:32:32.758 --> 01:32:34.783
On the ground!

1020
01:32:34.993 --> 01:32:39.225
Give me the money!

1021
01:32:42.167 --> 01:32:44.397
I'm not kidding.

1022
01:32:44.603 --> 01:32:46.833
The first person who moves
is dead!


1023
01:32:47.239 --> 01:32:50.868
The third time, the exception
becomes the rule.


1024
01:33:06.658 --> 01:33:11.027
Carrot and Knockout Ned
prepared to face Li'l Z'.


1025
01:33:11.229 --> 01:33:14.027
Carrot could protect his
business.


1026
01:33:14.299 --> 01:33:16.062
Knockout Ned...

1027
01:33:16.268 --> 01:33:19.203
the best marksman in his battalion,
wanted revenge.


1028
01:33:19.404 --> 01:33:23.602
First, the Italians.
This is a 9 mm.


1029
01:33:24.343 --> 01:33:26.573
- Let me see.
- Not bad, eh?


1030
01:33:26.778 --> 01:33:31.477
- The sight isn't well-aligned.
- I'll give you a good price.


1031
01:33:32.284 --> 01:33:34.275
The 12 mm, the "hand job".

1032
01:33:34.920 --> 01:33:36.148
See why?

1033
01:33:36.355 --> 01:33:39.415
An Uzi, 9 mm. It's Israeli.

1034
01:33:39.624 --> 01:33:42.491
- The star of David.
- Jewish.


1035
01:33:42.694 --> 01:33:44.059
I want a 30-06.

1036
01:33:44.529 --> 01:33:46.895
Now we can start having fun.

1037
01:33:47.099 --> 01:33:51.433
The war's on.
Let's start with a prayer.


1038
01:33:51.803 --> 01:33:55.899
Our Father who art in heaven
hallowed be our name...


1039
01:33:56.108 --> 01:34:00.272
Our will be done...

1040
01:34:00.812 --> 01:34:03.303
On earth as it is in heaven...

1041
01:34:16.561 --> 01:34:18.620
Hoodlums have guns,
but can't shoot.


1042
01:34:18.930 --> 01:34:22.957
One bullet from Knockout Ned
was worth ten from Li'l Z”s gang.


1043
01:34:23.168 --> 01:34:27.298
Li'l Z' couldn't take it.
He counter-attacked.


1044
01:34:29.941 --> 01:34:34.173
The ghetto had been a purgatory,
now it was hell.


1045
01:34:38.116 --> 01:34:43.816
I decided to get out.
That's how I became a reporter.


1046
01:34:44.689 --> 01:34:47.123
Great photo!

1047
01:34:47.325 --> 01:34:49.793
I bet it's by Rogerio Reis.

1048
01:34:50.362 --> 01:34:53.195
What did I tell you?

1049
01:34:53.398 --> 01:34:55.593
Like any pro...

1050
01:34:55.801 --> 01:34:59.237
I started at the bottom,
way down at the bottom.


1051
01:34:59.438 --> 01:35:02.896
Without knowing what awaited me.

1052
01:35:04.543 --> 01:35:07.512
Instead of going home
l'd go over to the paper.


1053
01:35:07.712 --> 01:35:11.079
A guy from the City of God
worked in the lab.


1054
01:35:11.283 --> 01:35:14.150

1055
01:35:14.352 --> 01:35:18.413
He helped me move closer to
what I loved most in life.


1056
01:35:18.623 --> 01:35:20.250
- Hi, Rogerio.
- How are you, Pierre?


1057
01:35:20.459 --> 01:35:23.087
This is Rocket.
He's a photographer.


1058
01:35:23.295 --> 01:35:24.455
Hello, Rocket.

1059
01:35:24.663 --> 01:35:26.927
- He's a fan of yours.
- Really?


1060
01:35:27.132 --> 01:35:28.759
You have good taste, Rocket!

1061
01:35:28.967 --> 01:35:32.061
- Well, l'm done. I'm off.
- See you.


1062
01:35:32.270 --> 01:35:34.932
What a cool guy!

1063
01:35:35.740 --> 01:35:38.834
What should have been
a swift revenge...


1064
01:35:39.044 --> 01:35:41.535
turned into an all-out war.

1065
01:35:46.651 --> 01:35:48.881
The City of God was divided.

1066
01:35:49.087 --> 01:35:52.887
You couldn't go from one
section to the other.


1067
01:35:53.091 --> 01:35:55.321
Not even to visit a relative.

1068
01:35:55.527 --> 01:35:59.258
The cops considered anyone
living in the ghetto a hoodlum.


1069
01:35:59.464 --> 01:36:02.900
People got used to living
in Vietnam.


1070
01:36:07.105 --> 01:36:12.065
And more and more volunteers
kept signing up to die.


1071
01:36:12.277 --> 01:36:13.266
This kid...

1072
01:36:13.478 --> 01:36:16.208
- What do you want?
- A boy from Carrot's gang punched me.


1073
01:36:16.748 --> 01:36:18.113
The war was
an excuse for everything.


1074
01:36:18.517 --> 01:36:20.485
One of Li'l Z”s soldiers
kicked me.


1075
01:36:22.521 --> 01:36:24.546
Take this.22.

1076
01:36:26.358 --> 01:36:28.826
The jerk who raped my sister is
with Carrot.


1077
01:36:29.027 --> 01:36:30.426
Li'l Z' evicted my family.

1078
01:36:31.463 --> 01:36:33.090
Kill... Be respected.

1079
01:36:45.477 --> 01:36:50.938
- I'm Thiago, a friend of Benny's.
- Can you read? Can you add?


1080
01:36:51.149 --> 01:36:56.587
- I'm pretty good in business.
- Okay, get to work.


1081
01:36:57.088 --> 01:37:00.455
- What do you want?
- To get my father's murderer.


1082
01:37:00.859 --> 01:37:03.623
- What's your name?
- My name's Otto.


1083
01:37:09.067 --> 01:37:11.035
What's the matter?

1084
01:37:11.236 --> 01:37:15.195
- He's a worker.
- But he wants a gun.


1085
01:37:15.941 --> 01:37:18.603
He won't last a week.

1086
01:37:29.621 --> 01:37:34.456
A year later, no one
remembered how it had all begun.


1087
01:37:34.659 --> 01:37:35.990
Take that!

1088
01:37:38.797 --> 01:37:44.736
For both sides, the aim was to take
over the enemy's business in order...


1089
01:37:44.936 --> 01:37:48.463
to buy more guns and take over
more businesses.


1090
01:38:10.295 --> 01:38:13.492
I smoke, snort,
l've killed and robbed.


1091
01:38:13.698 --> 01:38:16.030
I'm a man.

1092
01:38:37.689 --> 01:38:42.717
The media started taking an interest.
The police had to intervene.


1093
01:38:56.675 --> 01:39:01.078
A gang leader, from the City of God,
was arrested today.


1094
01:39:01.279 --> 01:39:03.008
Manuel Machado,
a.k.a. Knockout Ned...


1095
01:39:03.214 --> 01:39:06.615
was hospitalized after being
wounded by Li'l Z”s gang.


1096
01:39:06.818 --> 01:39:09.048
Our reporter interviewed him.

1097
01:39:09.254 --> 01:39:13.213
- Is the war still going on?
- It's still going on.


1098
01:39:13.491 --> 01:39:18.019
- Have many people died?
- Many have died.


1099
01:39:18.229 --> 01:39:20.356
Mostly innocent people.

1100
01:39:20.565 --> 01:39:23.932
Just knowing me is enough...

1101
01:39:24.135 --> 01:39:28.868
to get you killed by Li'l Z'.

1102
01:39:29.074 --> 01:39:32.441
- The police don't go in there?
- They go after me, not him.


1103
01:39:32.644 --> 01:39:38.981
I've been in jail, while he goes
on killing undisturbed.


1104
01:39:39.184 --> 01:39:41.277
And they don't arrest him.

1105
01:39:41.486 --> 01:39:43.784
Knockout Ned says
the war will continue.


1106
01:39:43.988 --> 01:39:49.585
Police Chief Guedes has promised
to arrest both of the gangs.


1107
01:39:58.069 --> 01:39:59.798
Motherfucker!

1108
01:40:00.004 --> 01:40:03.565
I'm the boss here, but he gets
his picture in the paper!


1109
01:40:03.775 --> 01:40:07.336
- Have you found mine?
- Just Knockout Ned's.


1110
01:40:07.545 --> 01:40:09.012
Keep looking.

1111
01:40:09.414 --> 01:40:12.144
At least my name's
got to be in there.


1112
01:40:12.350 --> 01:40:14.045
- There's nothing.
- Can you read?


1113
01:40:14.252 --> 01:40:16.686
Just the pictures.

1114
01:40:17.655 --> 01:40:19.714
Nothing.

1115
01:40:19.924 --> 01:40:23.018
Hey, what the fuck are you doing?

1116
01:40:23.228 --> 01:40:28.359
- It's just the want ads.
- I don't care, read everything!


1117
01:40:28.566 --> 01:40:32.730
- But there aren't any articles.
- Want a bullet in your head?


1118
01:40:34.739 --> 01:40:38.231
Gotta show them who's boss here.

1119
01:40:43.281 --> 01:40:46.978
- Give me the camera!
- No way!


1120
01:40:49.521 --> 01:40:51.853
Take my picture, man.

1121
01:40:52.457 --> 01:40:55.187
I can't work it.

1122
01:40:55.393 --> 01:40:57.088
Go ahead.

1123
01:40:57.462 --> 01:41:02.024
- I'll hold the Beretta.
- Let me try...


1124
01:41:02.667 --> 01:41:05.363
Back off...

1125
01:41:05.570 --> 01:41:09.836
- There's no click.
- What a bunch of bozos!


1126
01:41:10.341 --> 01:41:13.105
I'm fucked with you guys.

1127
01:41:15.180 --> 01:41:17.740
I have an idea.

1128
01:41:17.949 --> 01:41:22.477
I'll go get a guy I know.
Hang loose.


1129
01:41:23.354 --> 01:41:27.256
- Here he is.
- Take the camera.


1130
01:41:27.959 --> 01:41:30.393
Well, kid?

1131
01:41:31.462 --> 01:41:36.866
Aren't you a photographer?
Make the camerawork. We can't do it.


1132
01:41:38.670 --> 01:41:40.467
Take our picture.

1133
01:41:45.410 --> 01:41:49.210
- You fucking broke it.
- It wasn't me.


1134
01:41:49.781 --> 01:41:51.476
I found it.

1135
01:41:53.318 --> 01:41:55.479
It has to be wound.

1136
01:41:59.924 --> 01:42:02.916
- What's your name?
- Rocket.


1137
01:42:03.294 --> 01:42:07.230
- Another picture, Rocket.
- How about two rows?


1138
01:42:07.432 --> 01:42:12.335
- What?
- Two rows. Everyone with their guns.


1139
01:42:13.104 --> 01:42:17.131
- You're outside, for Christ's sake!
- Talk to him nicely, kid.


1140
01:42:17.342 --> 01:42:19.276
Sorry. Move in, please.

1141
01:42:21.779 --> 01:42:24.247
Another one.

1142
01:42:28.620 --> 01:42:30.918
- I think the roll's finished.
- Then show us the pictures.


1143
01:42:31.122 --> 01:42:33.989
- They have to be developed.
- Developed?


1144
01:42:35.226 --> 01:42:36.887
How much is it?

1145
01:42:37.495 --> 01:42:41.898
Take this money.
And bring back the pictures.


1146
01:42:42.100 --> 01:42:47.367
- I have to remove the film.
- Keep the camera.


1147
01:42:47.872 --> 01:42:52.275
Benny wanted to give it to you,
didn't he? So, it's yours...


1148
01:42:52.477 --> 01:42:54.308
Thanks.

1149
01:42:56.247 --> 01:43:00.445
Don't forget the pictures.
The photos, Rocket!


1150
01:43:11.529 --> 01:43:13.861
- Pierre!
- What?


1151
01:43:14.265 --> 01:43:17.632
Can you develop this for me?

1152
01:43:18.336 --> 01:43:21.794
I can't, Rocket.
I could get into trouble.


1153
01:43:22.006 --> 01:43:24.736
It's only for the paper's reporters.
I could risk my job.


1154
01:43:24.943 --> 01:43:26.433
- Pierre?
- Yes, Rogerio?


1155
01:43:26.644 --> 01:43:31.274
Develop these for me.
This one too, okay?


1156
01:43:31.683 --> 01:43:34.049
I'm going to lunch.

1157
01:43:34.252 --> 01:43:38.348
You're lucky. What size?

1158
01:43:38.556 --> 01:43:41.957
- What?
- For the enlargement, what size?


1159
01:43:42.427 --> 01:43:46.227
Well... Whatever you think is best.

1160
01:44:06.017 --> 01:44:08.144
- Here.
- Thanks.


1161
01:44:12.023 --> 01:44:14.685
I'm in deep shit now.

1162
01:44:16.594 --> 01:44:19.119
I'm as good as dead.

1163
01:44:30.375 --> 01:44:32.468
Someone had signed
my death sentence.


1164
01:44:32.677 --> 01:44:36.135
I wanted to bash the jerk's face in.

1165
01:44:41.819 --> 01:44:45.448
Are you Marina?
Because of you l'm dead.


1166
01:44:45.656 --> 01:44:47.783
You stole my photos.

1167
01:44:47.992 --> 01:44:51.860
Dead? Stole? What do you mean?
Not so loud.


1168
01:44:53.164 --> 01:44:55.689
Not so loud?
I'll be killed because of you.


1169
01:44:55.900 --> 01:44:58.460
You were gone,
your photos were in the lab.


1170
01:44:58.669 --> 01:45:01.502
There's nothing I can do.
The photos in our lab...


1171
01:45:01.706 --> 01:45:04.504
are photos to be published
in the paper.


1172
01:45:04.709 --> 01:45:07.974
I saw the photos,
I published them.


1173
01:45:08.179 --> 01:45:10.579
- You stole them.
- I did not. Here they are.


1174
01:45:10.782 --> 01:45:15.151
- Give them to me.
- Just a second.


1175
01:45:15.353 --> 01:45:18.481
Here are your photos.

1176
01:45:18.689 --> 01:45:22.455
- Are there any others?
- Calm down. What's your name?


1177
01:45:22.894 --> 01:45:25.954
- Rocket.
- Rocket?


1178
01:45:26.664 --> 01:45:29.064
Nice to meet you.
I'm Marina.


1179
01:45:29.267 --> 01:45:34.762
Now, relax. I have money for you.
For your pictures.


1180
01:45:35.173 --> 01:45:40.201
Here, when we use a picture
we pay the photographer.


1181
01:45:40.411 --> 01:45:43.437
- Do you want to be a photographer?
- Yes.


1182
01:45:43.648 --> 01:45:47.516
- Great start! On the front page.
- How'd you get these photos?


1183
01:45:47.718 --> 01:45:49.276
- I live there.
- Rocket...


1184
01:45:49.821 --> 01:45:53.723
no photographer has ever been able
to go in there.


1185
01:45:55.193 --> 01:45:59.823
If you could bring us
more pictures of Li'l Z'...


1186
01:46:00.031 --> 01:46:05.059
the paper would buy them.
We'd pay you.


1187
01:46:05.269 --> 01:46:07.328
Could you?

1188
01:46:07.538 --> 01:46:09.403
I don't know.

1189
01:46:09.707 --> 01:46:11.072
What's the problem?

1190
01:46:11.275 --> 01:46:14.108
The problem? I can't go there
anymore at night.


1191
01:46:14.312 --> 01:46:18.578
- And during the day?
- It's too risky.


1192
01:46:20.184 --> 01:46:25.713
Look, man! They've finally
understood that l'm the boss.


1193
01:46:27.358 --> 01:46:29.155
What's your
photographer-friend's name?


1194
01:46:29.360 --> 01:46:30.588
Rocket.

1195
01:46:30.795 --> 01:46:33.992
He's good. I'll take more
to show the others.


1196
01:46:37.168 --> 01:46:40.433
So, Rocket, is it yes or no?

1197
01:46:42.707 --> 01:46:45.676
It's a great opportunity.

1198
01:46:47.612 --> 01:46:49.011
Okay.

1199
01:46:50.248 --> 01:46:54.844
- You made the right choice. Very good!
- I'll give you some film, lenses...


1200
01:46:55.052 --> 01:47:00.752
and even another camera.
I'll show you the equipment room.


1201
01:47:00.958 --> 01:47:04.223
There's another problem.

1202
01:47:04.428 --> 01:47:07.454
- What is it?
- Where can I sleep tonight?


1203
01:47:08.232 --> 01:47:10.894
I can't go back now.

1204
01:47:13.738 --> 01:47:18.232
This is a 135 mm.
Will you be close up or far away?


1205
01:47:18.442 --> 01:47:19.431
Far away.

1206
01:47:19.911 --> 01:47:22.436
- Can you measure the light?
- Yes.


1207
01:47:24.549 --> 01:47:27.347
Aren't you too close?

1208
01:47:29.520 --> 01:47:33.388
I don't know what spurred me
to go talk to them like that.


1209
01:47:33.591 --> 01:47:35.786
Maybe I was going to die...

1210
01:47:35.993 --> 01:47:39.394
but now I had a camera...

1211
01:47:39.597 --> 01:47:42.293
and a chance to become
a photographer.


1212
01:47:42.867 --> 01:47:45.267
Watch out for the dog shit.

1213
01:47:45.703 --> 01:47:48.934
Not to mention that
the night was still young...


1214
01:47:49.140 --> 01:47:52.507
- Want something to eat?
- No thank you, ma'am.


1215
01:47:52.710 --> 01:47:58.410
Nothing to eat? Nothing to drink?
A joint?


1216
01:47:59.684 --> 01:48:01.447
Try this...

1217
01:48:20.238 --> 01:48:22.365
It's time to go to sleep.

1218
01:48:24.408 --> 01:48:27.741
I'll show you your bed.

1219
01:48:27.945 --> 01:48:30.971
- You have hot water, don't you?
- Yes.


1220
01:48:31.182 --> 01:48:33.673
You've never taken a hot shower?

1221
01:48:33.884 --> 01:48:36.114
- No.
- What do you do?


1222
01:48:36.320 --> 01:48:39.551
We heat up the kettle.

1223
01:48:39.757 --> 01:48:43.625
- Why are you standing there?
- What room do I sleep in?


1224
01:48:43.828 --> 01:48:49.960
Unfortunately, there's only one room.
You have to sleep with me.


1225
01:48:50.167 --> 01:48:53.830
I won't go into the details
of my first sexual experience.


1226
01:48:54.038 --> 01:48:57.132
Just relax...

1227
01:48:57.742 --> 01:48:59.642
Because, elsewhere...

1228
01:48:59.844 --> 01:49:04.508
another more important sex scene
for the ghetto was taking place.


1229
01:49:05.950 --> 01:49:08.248
Carrot was helping
Knockout Ned escape...


1230
01:49:08.452 --> 01:49:11.080
without firing a shot.

1231
01:49:12.523 --> 01:49:18.519
The policeman guarding him was
in the willing hands of the nurse.


1232
01:49:19.196 --> 01:49:20.288
And in the meantime...

1233
01:49:20.498 --> 01:49:23.899
to eliminate Carrot, Li'l Z'
was investing in munitions.


1234
01:49:24.101 --> 01:49:26.831
He invested heavily,
even if he couldn't pay...


1235
01:49:28.137 --> 01:49:31.538
- Remember the double-barrel?
- I already have it.


1236
01:49:31.741 --> 01:49:36.508
This is a repeater rifle. You don't have
this one, the Browning.


1237
01:49:36.746 --> 01:49:39.806
- It'll shoot down a plane.
- I'm not shooting down planes.


1238
01:49:40.016 --> 01:49:43.315
And the one I asked for?
The AR-15, Uncle Sam.


1239
01:49:44.086 --> 01:49:46.953
You can't get them in Brazil.

1240
01:49:47.156 --> 01:49:49.147
My ass, Uncle Sam.

1241
01:49:52.094 --> 01:49:54.324
I have a solution.

1242
01:49:54.530 --> 01:49:56.225
The Rugger. Ever seen one?

1243
01:49:56.432 --> 01:50:00.960
It's like the AR-15.
Same caliber, but lighter.


1244
01:50:01.170 --> 01:50:04.571
With an infrared sight?

1245
01:50:04.774 --> 01:50:07.607
- It depends.
- It depends, my ass!


1246
01:50:07.810 --> 01:50:10.370
Trying to fuck me over?

1247
01:50:10.713 --> 01:50:12.578
I'll fuck you over first.

1248
01:50:12.782 --> 01:50:15.683
You leave now without the money
or the guns.


1249
01:50:16.752 --> 01:50:19.414
- What do I tell the boss?
- That's your problem.


1250
01:50:19.622 --> 01:50:23.786
- You'll think of something.
- You heard him, chubby? Get out.


1251
01:50:24.260 --> 01:50:27.525
Beat it, fatso.

1252
01:50:27.730 --> 01:50:29.288
Li'l Z' had made a big mistake.

1253
01:50:29.499 --> 01:50:33.799
He should have known that behind
every salesman lies a supplier.


1254
01:50:34.003 --> 01:50:36.233
And they don't joke around.

1255
01:50:37.740 --> 01:50:40.300
Have you seen this?

1256
01:50:40.710 --> 01:50:43.076
What do they need an AR-15 for?

1257
01:50:43.279 --> 01:50:46.248
These stories will push
the police to investigate.


1258
01:50:46.449 --> 01:50:48.713
They'll nab you.
And me, along with you.


1259
01:50:48.918 --> 01:50:53.548
Think l'm going
to give you away?


1260
01:50:56.726 --> 01:50:59.320
Don't worry,
l'll take care of it.


1261
01:50:59.529 --> 01:51:01.690
But don't fuck up again.

1262
01:51:08.471 --> 01:51:10.632
Charlie!

1263
01:51:11.340 --> 01:51:13.240
Come here!

1264
01:51:13.442 --> 01:51:15.000
Listen...

1265
01:51:15.211 --> 01:51:17.907
you tell him...

1266
01:51:18.681 --> 01:51:22.811
Let's go make that sleazy
little dealer pay up.


1267
01:51:33.930 --> 01:51:36.558
Come here, kids!

1268
01:51:38.634 --> 01:51:42.161
- Do you like chicken?
- It depends.


1269
01:51:42.371 --> 01:51:45.772
We'll eat some chicken
and have Carrot for dessert.


1270
01:51:45.975 --> 01:51:49.308
I have a present for you.

1271
01:51:51.380 --> 01:51:53.075
Here...

1272
01:51:54.917 --> 01:51:56.908
A big one for you.

1273
01:51:57.119 --> 01:51:59.144
Are you really giving us
these guns?


1274
01:51:59.355 --> 01:52:04.088
Yes, but I want you on my side,
against Carrot.


1275
01:52:04.293 --> 01:52:07.023
Then can we hold up
anyone we want?


1276
01:52:07.229 --> 01:52:09.925
Not in the ghetto.
Can you shoot?


1277
01:52:10.132 --> 01:52:11.929
- More or less.
- More or less?


1278
01:52:12.134 --> 01:52:17.595
Hey, you guys, come help
these kids.


1279
01:52:19.108 --> 01:52:21.099
I know. You do it like this.

1280
01:52:27.249 --> 01:52:29.649
THE BEGINNING OF THE END

1281
01:52:38.361 --> 01:52:39.350
Get that chicken!

1282
01:52:52.642 --> 01:52:53.836
C'mon, let's go.

1283
01:52:54.043 --> 01:52:55.977
If Li'l Z' catches you,
he'll kill you.


1284
01:52:57.980 --> 01:53:00.847
Yeah, well, he's gotta
find me first.


1285
01:53:08.724 --> 01:53:11.989
Hey, kid! Get that chicken!

1286
01:53:14.630 --> 01:53:16.120
Shit! The cops!

1287
01:53:16.332 --> 01:53:18.391
Hell, don't fucking run off!

1288
01:53:18.601 --> 01:53:20.466
Give me that.

1289
01:53:31.714 --> 01:53:34.080
Hey, Melonhead! 
You fucking fag!

1290
01:53:34.283 --> 01:53:37.411
Get the hell out of here!

1291
01:53:37.620 --> 01:53:38.985
Coward!

1292
01:53:39.188 --> 01:53:41.213
Asshole!

1293
01:53:42.158 --> 01:53:45.093
Come on, let them kill each other.

1294
01:53:45.294 --> 01:53:48.024
They can fuck themselves.

1295
01:53:56.172 --> 01:53:58.663
Rocket! Take a picture of us!

1296
01:54:00.076 --> 01:54:02.374
What are you waiting for?

1297
01:54:23.966 --> 01:54:25.729
What's happening?

1298
01:54:26.102 --> 01:54:27.501
Shit!

1299
01:54:40.583 --> 01:54:42.483
Let's go!

1300
01:55:14.517 --> 01:55:17.179
Run! Run!

1301
01:55:17.386 --> 01:55:20.253
Watch out!

1302
01:55:20.456 --> 01:55:23.448
Kill one of these faggots!
Blast him!


1303
01:55:43.112 --> 01:55:45.546
Knockout Ned!

1304
01:55:59.328 --> 01:56:02.126
Take it easy. Don't move.

1305
01:56:02.331 --> 01:56:04.060
It hurts, man.

1306
01:56:04.266 --> 01:56:06.826
Easy does it, kid.

1307
01:56:07.837 --> 01:56:10.499
Why did you join this fucking war?

1308
01:56:10.706 --> 01:56:13.436
Knockout Ned!
Li'l Z' has been hit. Come on!


1309
01:56:14.810 --> 01:56:17.802
Wait here, l'll help you.
Just hold on.


1310
01:56:27.022 --> 01:56:31.322
- What's your name?
- My name's Otto.


1311
01:56:38.367 --> 01:56:41.359
I want to get my father's murderer.

1312
01:57:05.961 --> 01:57:08.429
Knockout Ned! Li'l Z' has been hit.
Come on!


1313
01:57:09.798 --> 01:57:14.132
I'll help you.
Just hold on there.


1314
01:57:53.275 --> 01:57:56.608
The fucking cops!

1315
01:57:56.812 --> 01:57:58.245
On the ground!

1316
01:57:58.447 --> 01:58:00.347
- Hands over your head.
- Don't move!


1317
01:58:08.590 --> 01:58:14.893
- You're the one I want.
- You're finished, pal.


1318
01:58:15.097 --> 01:58:17.156
Handcuff him.

1319
01:58:34.149 --> 01:58:35.707
Rocket, where are you going?

1320
01:58:35.918 --> 01:58:38.386
I got something to clear up.

1321
01:59:09.785 --> 01:59:11.309
Okay, lovebirds?

1322
01:59:11.520 --> 01:59:15.217
Come on, Li'l Z',
let's go settle our scores.


1323
01:59:16.058 --> 01:59:20.154
Not you. You're a present
for the media.


1324
01:59:56.265 --> 01:59:57.698
Does it come to 10,000?

1325
01:59:57.900 --> 02:00:00.960
Almost. That's all I have.

1326
02:00:01.170 --> 02:00:04.537
- That's all there was, Chief.
- We searched everywhere.


1327
02:00:04.740 --> 02:00:07.231
Let him go.

1328
02:00:11.647 --> 02:00:14.548
What about this ring?
Is it gold?


1329
02:00:14.750 --> 02:00:20.655
Fill it up. You'll owe us
the rest.


1330
02:00:24.426 --> 02:00:26.656
Fucking war!

1331
02:00:28.897 --> 02:00:31.457
Knockout Ned is dead
and I'm dead broke!


1332
02:00:31.667 --> 02:00:33.931
You're fucked, eh?

1333
02:00:34.136 --> 02:00:35.398
Kids...

1334
02:00:35.604 --> 02:00:39.506
we'll have to do a few hold-ups
to get my business going again.


1335
02:00:39.708 --> 02:00:42.643
- Your business, Li'l Z'?
- What's your problem, kid?


1336
02:00:42.845 --> 02:00:45.507
This is for our friend,
motherfucker!


1337
02:00:45.714 --> 02:00:47.238
A Soviet attack!

1338
02:00:54.556 --> 02:00:57.491
The business is ours!

1339
02:01:51.280 --> 02:01:55.580
This picture of the hood
will get me the job.


1340
02:01:57.920 --> 02:01:59.785
This one will make me famous.

1341
02:01:59.988 --> 02:02:02.752
It'll even make the cover
of a magazine.


1342
02:02:05.060 --> 02:02:08.655
I won't have to worry
about Li'l Z' anymore.


1343
02:02:10.599 --> 02:02:13.295
But the cops?

1344
02:02:20.642 --> 02:02:25.079
GANGSTER, SELF-STYLED "BOSS"
OF THE CITY OF GOD, SHOT DEAD


1345
02:02:27.516 --> 02:02:32.112
This photo could've gotten
us killed?


1346
02:02:32.321 --> 02:02:33.879
I think so.

1347
02:02:34.089 --> 02:02:36.785
At least it got you a job.

1348
02:02:36.992 --> 02:02:40.826
- Not a job, an internship.
- It pays a little, doesn't it?


1349
02:02:41.029 --> 02:02:43.463
A little.

1350
02:02:43.732 --> 02:02:46.701
What about that lady journalist?
Was she a good lay?


1351
02:02:46.902 --> 02:02:49.268
- More or less.
- You didn't like it?


1352
02:02:49.471 --> 02:02:51.905
I don't think journalists know how
to screw.


1353
02:02:52.107 --> 02:02:53.096
Yeah, I guess so.

1354
02:02:53.308 --> 02:02:55.674
Cocoa robbed 3 houses in Barra.

1355
02:02:55.877 --> 02:02:57.469
Better kill him.

1356
02:02:57.679 --> 02:02:59.340
Who shot Roger?

1357
02:02:59.548 --> 02:03:01.880
- It was Beef.
- Kill that fucker.


1358
02:03:02.084 --> 02:03:04.450
We should kill the Chief
and Gringo as well.


1359
02:03:04.653 --> 02:03:08.145
- What about Cherry?
- Let's go. Us two, and 3 others...


1360
02:03:08.357 --> 02:03:10.222
It's a deal.

1361
02:03:10.425 --> 02:03:13.019
Have you heard
of the Red Brigade?


1362
02:03:13.228 --> 02:03:16.527
No, but if they come,
we'll kill them.


1363
02:03:16.898 --> 02:03:21.164
- Who knows how to write?
- Me, sort of.


1364
02:03:21.570 --> 02:03:24.403
Let's make a black list.
We'll kill them all.


1365
02:03:24.606 --> 02:03:28.167
- Put fucking Nightowl on there.
- And Croquet.


1366
02:03:28.377 --> 02:03:29.901
Leonard, too, he owes me money.

1367
02:03:30.112 --> 02:03:32.046
And China-Man,
he thinks he's hot stuff.


1368
02:03:32.247 --> 02:03:35.239
- And Claudio.
- Where's Giant?


1369
02:03:35.450 --> 02:03:38.180
Come on, Giant!

1370
02:03:52.634 --> 02:03:56.297
I forgot to say,
my name isn't Rocket anymore.


1371
02:03:56.505 --> 02:03:58.735
BASED ON A REAL STORY
l'm now Wilson Rodrigues...


1372
02:03:58.940 --> 02:04:00.635
photographer.

1373
02:04:21.663 --> 02:04:23.460
Manuel Machado,
a.k.a. Knockout Ned...


1374
02:04:23.665 --> 02:04:26.759
was hospitalized after
being wounded by Li'l Z”s gang.


1375
02:04:26.968 --> 02:04:29.960
On leaving the hospital,
our reporter interviewed him.


1376
02:04:30.172 --> 02:04:33.232
Many have died.
Mostly innocent people.


1377
02:04:33.442 --> 02:04:37.071
Just knowing me is enough...

1378
02:04:37.279 --> 02:04:41.113
just being my friend...

1379
02:04:41.316 --> 02:04:45.252
If he thinks someone knows me,
he'll kill them.


1380
02:04:45.454 --> 02:04:47.354
The police don't go in there?

1381
02:04:47.556 --> 02:04:52.926
They go after me, not him.

1382
02:04:53.128 --> 02:04:58.191
I've been in jail 3 times,
while he goes on...


1383
02:04:58.400 --> 02:05:00.891
killing undisturbed.

1384
02:05:01.103 --> 02:05:03.765
And they don't arrest him.

1385
02:05:04.172 --> 02:05:06.697
Knockout Ned says
the war will continue.


1386
02:05:06.908 --> 02:05:11.777
Police Chief Guedes has promised to
arrest both gangs in the City of God.
