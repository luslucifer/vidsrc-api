2
00:02:26.197 --> 00:02:29.000
The prototype
has been located.


3
00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.968
Water.

4
00:03:54.752 --> 00:03:56.254
I don't feel so good.

5
00:03:56.388 --> 00:03:59.357
Considering you've been buried
for over 300 years,


6
00:03:59.491 --> 00:04:01.159
you look pretty good to me.

7
00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:04.295
What? What the hell
are you talking about?


8
00:04:05.397 --> 00:04:06.831
Do I know you?

9
00:04:07.664 --> 00:04:09.666
You look kind of familiar.

10
00:04:10.435 --> 00:04:11.702
You can call me Tony.

11
00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:15.606
I'm a human clone of one of your
dead colleagues at the agency.


12
00:04:16.808 --> 00:04:18.675
You can't remember
a thing, can you?


13
00:04:19.576 --> 00:04:21.246
No, am I supposed to?

14
00:04:22.646 --> 00:04:25.050
Don't worry,
we're on the same team.


15
00:04:25.649 --> 00:04:27.584
We're the good guys.

16
00:04:27.718 --> 00:04:29.287
Your name is Garrett Brown.

17
00:04:29.421 --> 00:04:32.424
Your the last human survivor
of the nuclear war.


18
00:04:33.058 --> 00:04:37.262
Everything, everybody
you knew, is gone.


19
00:04:37.395 --> 00:04:39.763
What the hell are you
talking about, man?


20
00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.069
I don't believe anything
you're saying. What the...


21
00:04:44.202 --> 00:04:46.371
- Where the hell am I?
- Calm down.


22
00:04:47.105 --> 00:04:50.108
Look around.
The world you knew is gone.


23
00:04:50.375 --> 00:04:53.344
Your life has been preserved
until just the right moment.


24
00:04:53.478 --> 00:04:54.846
And this is it.

25
00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:57.182
But you have less
than one day of life in you.


26
00:04:57.315 --> 00:05:00.218
You have survived all this time
because you drank one of these.


27
00:05:02.187 --> 00:05:04.522
I've just given you an
additional injection.


28
00:05:04.655 --> 00:05:06.091
It'll help you remember.

29
00:05:06.224 --> 00:05:08.093
Trust me, we can't move forward

30
00:05:08.226 --> 00:05:10.195
if you don't remember
what happened.


31
00:05:10.328 --> 00:05:12.130
Why in the hell should
I trust you?


32
00:05:12.263 --> 00:05:14.665
You're dying.
You better believe that.


33
00:05:16.101 --> 00:05:17.202
I'm dying?

34
00:05:17.335 --> 00:05:19.137
What the hell did you
inject me with?


35
00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:21.605
It's an alien supplement.
I understand you had it before.


36
00:05:21.738 --> 00:05:24.042
Now concentrate.
We do not have much time.


37
00:05:24.175 --> 00:05:26.677
Hopefully, it will
help you remember.


38
00:05:28.246 --> 00:05:29.680
Hopefully.

39
00:05:31.416 --> 00:05:32.851
Hope.

40
00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.186
Reverend Hope.

41
00:05:36.321 --> 00:05:37.754
The case.

42
00:05:51.236 --> 00:05:53.805
We've become skeptical
evangelists


43
00:05:53.938 --> 00:05:55.473
full of fire and brimstone.

44
00:05:56.107 --> 00:05:58.343
Who come on television
to ask us for money.


45
00:05:59.743 --> 00:06:01.179
I am not going to do that.

46
00:06:02.514 --> 00:06:05.649
We've been criticized for using
our followers' donations


47
00:06:05.782 --> 00:06:08.086
to fund many successful
businesses.


48
00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:12.824
I felt we should use
the money responsibly,


49
00:06:12.957 --> 00:06:14.392
support ourselves.

50
00:06:16.494 --> 00:06:18.863
We have followers who are poor

51
00:06:18.997 --> 00:06:21.966
and it is difficult
for them to give.


52
00:06:23.101 --> 00:06:25.803
I am happy to announce today

53
00:06:25.937 --> 00:06:28.772
that the Jeremiah
C. Hope Ministries,


54
00:06:28.907 --> 00:06:31.675
will no longer
be accepting donations.


55
00:06:32.243 --> 00:06:35.280
We'll be the first of our kind
to operate


56
00:06:35.413 --> 00:06:37.949
without taking another penny
from anyone.


57
00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:41.152
<i>The United States
government pegged him</i>


58
00:06:41.286 --> 00:06:43.254
<i>as another false messiah.</i>

59
00:06:43.621 --> 00:06:47.058
They feared he would become the
most dangerous man in the world.


60
00:06:47.192 --> 00:06:50.727
Worse than Jim Jones,
David Koresh,


61
00:06:50.862 --> 00:06:52.997
even worse
than Mercury Mason,


62
00:06:53.131 --> 00:06:55.066
the deadliest of all
the false prophets.


63
00:06:55.732 --> 00:07:01.105
He was responsible for the
suicide deaths of 5,000 men,


64
00:07:01.239 --> 00:07:05.276
women and children
in August 2003.


65
00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:10.014
Jeremiah Hope, a simple country
boy from Georgia,


66
00:07:10.148 --> 00:07:13.251
who's pledged his life
to God's service.


67
00:07:13.384 --> 00:07:16.187
They weren't about to
let it happen again.


68
00:07:16.321 --> 00:07:17.522
Sci
-Tech,

69
00:07:17.655 --> 00:07:20.525
a special investigation agency,
was created.


70
00:07:20.959 --> 00:07:25.096
The best of the FBI, CIA
and other special agencies


71
00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:27.332
throughout the free world.

72
00:07:27.465 --> 00:07:31.469
This time it was a different
case, a new enigma.


73
00:07:32.136 --> 00:07:35.273
It was about one man
and one man alone.


74
00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:38.943
Reverend Jeremiah C. Hope.

75
00:07:40.845 --> 00:07:42.480
Good, you're starting
to recover.


76
00:07:42.947 --> 00:07:44.816
Maybe, but I still
feel like crap.


77
00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:47.118
That's normal after
all this time,


78
00:07:47.252 --> 00:07:49.153
you'll be yourself
in no time, okay?


79
00:07:49.287 --> 00:07:51.689
What do you mean, "No time?"
One day, two days? What?


80
00:07:51.823 --> 00:07:53.458
Unfortunately, yes.

81
00:08:01.765 --> 00:08:04.202
Shit. We got company.
Stay down.


82
00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:17.682
That'll buy us some time.
Come on, we got to go.


83
00:08:17.815 --> 00:08:19.150
- Where to?
- That was our ride.


84
00:08:19.284 --> 00:08:21.886
We've got to find a place
to hide. Let's go.


85
00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:01.893
- Cigarette?
- No thanks.


86
00:09:02.026 --> 00:09:04.062
Last smoke on Earth.

87
00:09:06.998 --> 00:09:08.433
So, where are you taking me?

88
00:09:08.566 --> 00:09:10.201
Home.

89
00:09:10.335 --> 00:09:11.936
Home?

90
00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:13.771
To what's left
of the agency.


91
00:09:13.905 --> 00:09:16.341
Years ago, we built a
subterranean secret facility


92
00:09:16.474 --> 00:09:19.444
to protect us from
the radiation.


93
00:09:19.577 --> 00:09:21.045
Although the humans died

94
00:09:21.679 --> 00:09:23.448
we got our hands on
some alien technology


95
00:09:23.581 --> 00:09:25.616
and we managed
to clone ourselves.


96
00:09:27.051 --> 00:09:30.555
Only the fittest
and the strongest made it.


97
00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:33.524
What else do you remember?

98
00:09:34.992 --> 00:09:36.361
I don't know, man.
I'm too tired.


99
00:09:36.494 --> 00:09:38.963
Listen to me.
This is extremely important.


100
00:09:40.264 --> 00:09:41.532
Look, come on man.

101
00:09:41.666 --> 00:09:43.368
I don't know if you're real
or not.


102
00:09:43.501 --> 00:09:45.536
Seriously, tell me what
is going on here.


103
00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:48.639
Look, I have nothing to hide,
okay? I'm here to help you.


104
00:09:49.273 --> 00:09:53.244
Help me? Okay. 
Who buried me?

105
00:09:54.278 --> 00:09:56.114
Virgil Conway did.

106
00:09:56.849 --> 00:09:58.149
He wanted to preserve your life.

107
00:09:58.282 --> 00:09:59.984
He's also my creator.

108
00:10:00.118 --> 00:10:02.019
Do you remember him?

109
00:10:02.754 --> 00:10:04.188
Can't say I do.

110
00:10:05.156 --> 00:10:06.591
He's already dead.

111
00:10:09.427 --> 00:10:10.895
So why did you come for me?

112
00:10:11.028 --> 00:10:12.865
You'll find out later,
I promise.


113
00:10:12.997 --> 00:10:14.565
Great.

114
00:10:15.967 --> 00:10:17.836
Who was that that
just attacked us?


115
00:10:17.969 --> 00:10:20.204
Alien terrorists from
the planet Nobus.


116
00:10:21.706 --> 00:10:25.943
Nobus?
You're very creative, Tony.


117
00:10:26.077 --> 00:10:27.445
As I told you,
I'm here to help you.


118
00:10:27.578 --> 00:10:29.080
Now, what else do you
remember about this?


119
00:10:34.952 --> 00:10:36.855
<i>SciTech agency log.</i>

120
00:10:36.988 --> 00:10:40.024
<i>Monday, 17 April, 1998.</i>

121
00:10:40.158 --> 00:10:43.796
<i>Investigate the rising
of Reverend Jeremiah C. Hope.</i>


122
00:10:43.928 --> 00:10:47.432
<i>Mysterious disappearances at
Hope's discovery camps.</i>


123
00:10:47.565 --> 00:10:52.170
<i>Money ties with Future Corp
and CEO Stew Horn.</i>


124
00:10:53.004 --> 00:10:54.539
That was brutal.

125
00:10:54.672 --> 00:10:56.741
I love getting yelled at for an
hour straight, don't you?


126
00:10:56.875 --> 00:10:58.543
Yeah. Well, what do you expect?

127
00:10:58.676 --> 00:11:00.278
I mean, they've been trying
to keep this thing


128
00:11:00.411 --> 00:11:01.847
out of the media forever.

129
00:11:01.979 --> 00:11:03.481
Well, with the shit
that went down


130
00:11:03.614 --> 00:11:05.550
with Mercury Mason,
I can't say that I blame them.


131
00:11:05.683 --> 00:11:07.151
Shit man.

132
00:11:07.285 --> 00:11:08.953
Reverend Hope is going
to be on the cover


133
00:11:09.086 --> 00:11:12.056
of every major magazine and
every television show tomorrow.


134
00:11:12.925 --> 00:11:14.158
If the stress is too much,

135
00:11:14.292 --> 00:11:15.693
maybe you should consider
other work.


136
00:11:16.761 --> 00:11:18.596
The weak don't survive
in this business.


137
00:11:19.063 --> 00:11:20.598
Who you calling weak?

138
00:11:21.699 --> 00:11:23.501
It was just
a general statement.


139
00:11:23.634 --> 00:11:25.603
It was not directed
at anyone in particular.


140
00:11:27.038 --> 00:11:29.607
Come on. Let it go.

141
00:11:30.876 --> 00:11:32.811
He's just pushing your buttons.

142
00:11:32.945 --> 00:11:34.178
Good idea.

143
00:11:34.847 --> 00:11:38.015
Considering I'm the lead agent
in this investigation.


144
00:11:42.119 --> 00:11:44.489
You don't have to constantly
remind us.


145
00:12:01.372 --> 00:12:03.574
With this, we have plenty
to start turning up the heat


146
00:12:03.708 --> 00:12:05.142
on Reverend Hope.

147
00:12:05.276 --> 00:12:06.945
Why the delays?

148
00:12:07.778 --> 00:12:09.714
Our execution
has to be flawless.


149
00:12:09.848 --> 00:12:11.115
Our plan, perfect.

150
00:12:11.249 --> 00:12:13.384
Come on. The whole world
knows this guy.


151
00:12:13.518 --> 00:12:15.119
We've got to start pressuring
him now.


152
00:12:15.419 --> 00:12:18.489
We will not be reckless just
because we under scrutiny.


153
00:12:42.046 --> 00:12:43.614
More bullshit.

154
00:12:44.682 --> 00:12:47.618
I had a meeting with the contact
that gave me the pictures.


155
00:12:47.752 --> 00:12:48.987
Virgil Conway.

156
00:12:49.587 --> 00:12:51.489
All right. You finally found
out his name, huh?


157
00:12:51.622 --> 00:12:54.058
I had to go to Italy
to find the guy.


158
00:12:55.027 --> 00:12:56.694
Pictures, too.

159
00:12:56.828 --> 00:12:58.229
Who's the woman?

160
00:12:58.362 --> 00:13:00.899
His girlfriend.
Her name is Rosa.


161
00:13:01.033 --> 00:13:04.036
She's an exchange student
at a local university.


162
00:13:04.168 --> 00:13:05.603
Her family's in Italy.

163
00:13:06.737 --> 00:13:08.907
What, you only have
two pictures of her?


164
00:13:09.041 --> 00:13:10.708
It was windy.

165
00:13:10.842 --> 00:13:13.744
I kept waiting for her dress to
fly up so I could take more.


166
00:13:14.111 --> 00:13:17.615
- Never happened.
- The voice of a real pro.


167
00:13:18.149 --> 00:13:19.952
- She's not involved.
- Alright.


168
00:13:20.384 --> 00:13:22.286
This afternoon, I'm meeting
with a programmer


169
00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:24.455
from Future Corp that
got fired last week.


170
00:13:25.089 --> 00:13:26.624
Virgil's to contact
me tomorrow.


171
00:13:26.757 --> 00:13:28.092
Good.

172
00:13:28.225 --> 00:13:30.194
Well, I'll be with the fun
and exciting boys


173
00:13:30.328 --> 00:13:33.497
from electronic reconnaissance
all day tomorrow.


174
00:13:34.599 --> 00:13:39.637
Why don't you meet me at my
place in, uh, 42 hours.


175
00:13:40.171 --> 00:13:41.974
- All right?
- All right.


176
00:13:42.106 --> 00:13:44.042
- Hey.
- What?


177
00:13:44.508 --> 00:13:47.111
I've been investigating
something else lately.


178
00:13:47.745 --> 00:13:49.347
What's that?

179
00:13:50.314 --> 00:13:51.749
You're sleeping with Jenna.

180
00:13:54.151 --> 00:13:55.586
All right,
I'll catch you later.


181
00:14:02.159 --> 00:14:04.295
Goddamn,
can you say, "Obsessed?"


182
00:14:04.863 --> 00:14:06.397
Helps keep me focused.

183
00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:08.165
Well, at least you don't
have a picture


184
00:14:08.299 --> 00:14:10.434
- of him in a bathing suit.
- Oh, but I do.


185
00:14:10.568 --> 00:14:12.236
Keep it hidden
under my mattress.


186
00:14:13.038 --> 00:14:15.773
- Come on, show me what you got.
- All right.


187
00:14:19.911 --> 00:14:21.445
Virgil gave me this.

188
00:14:22.881 --> 00:14:25.117
This links Future Corp
to the Hope Ministries


189
00:14:25.249 --> 00:14:27.318
and number one to both of them.

190
00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:29.553
It's not enough.

191
00:14:29.687 --> 00:14:31.622
We need to catch
him in the act.


192
00:14:32.456 --> 00:14:34.692
I thought you might say that.

193
00:14:35.526 --> 00:14:37.662
He told me someone from Future
Corp is going to deliver


194
00:14:37.796 --> 00:14:39.730
a package to Number One
tomorrow night.


195
00:14:40.297 --> 00:14:42.199
Well, that package better
be damn important.


196
00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:43.902
We've got to convince Hines

197
00:14:44.036 --> 00:14:46.104
to let us go
after his number one agent.


198
00:14:46.237 --> 00:14:48.940
How about two million in cash?

199
00:14:50.042 --> 00:14:53.511
That's it.
Stew Herns from Future Corp.


200
00:14:53.644 --> 00:14:55.246
He's been transferring funds

201
00:14:55.379 --> 00:14:57.715
to offshore accounts for,
what, six months now?


202
00:14:57.849 --> 00:15:00.518
And I'll bet you it's close
to two million bucks.


203
00:15:01.153 --> 00:15:03.021
And it's a match.

204
00:15:03.822 --> 00:15:06.257
Why don't we just take the
money and go to Aruba?


205
00:15:06.892 --> 00:15:09.861
- I'd spend it in six months.
- Yeah, I believe that.


206
00:15:14.066 --> 00:15:15.834
Sure you wanna do this?

207
00:15:17.635 --> 00:15:19.071
Yeah.

208
00:15:19.203 --> 00:15:22.473
All right. We'll take this
to Hines in the morning.


209
00:15:22.606 --> 00:15:24.508
Go home and get some sleep.

210
00:15:30.115 --> 00:15:31.615
You've got balls.

211
00:15:34.552 --> 00:15:37.388
Are you sure that you
can prove this?


212
00:15:39.891 --> 00:15:43.761
- Absolutely.
- Enough to risk your own career?


213
00:15:44.129 --> 00:15:46.263
Yes, sir.

214
00:15:51.335 --> 00:15:53.004
I'm giving you the green light.

215
00:15:55.306 --> 00:15:57.742
Don't mess this up.

216
00:16:02.914 --> 00:16:04.582
No turning back now.

217
00:16:04.715 --> 00:16:06.852
Wouldn't have it any other way.

218
00:18:09.975 --> 00:18:11.843
You're a traitor
to the agency.


219
00:18:12.543 --> 00:18:14.645
Don't make this any
more difficult.


220
00:21:07.352 --> 00:21:08.887
Jesus.

221
00:21:45.890 --> 00:21:48.993
Jenna. Jenna, wake up.

222
00:21:49.127 --> 00:21:51.695
Come on, wake up.
What happened?


223
00:21:53.264 --> 00:21:57.068
Number One was here.
He killed everybody.


224
00:21:57.969 --> 00:21:59.670
No, no, no, no, no.

225
00:21:59.804 --> 00:22:01.973
That's impossible.
I just killed him.


226
00:22:03.174 --> 00:22:05.676
I don't want to die.
I don't want to die.


227
00:22:05.810 --> 00:22:08.146
Hey, hey, shh. Hey, hey.

228
00:22:08.279 --> 00:22:12.250
It's all right. It's all right.
It's going to be okay.


229
00:22:12.383 --> 00:22:13.818
I promise.

230
00:22:15.954 --> 00:22:17.754
Do you still love me?

231
00:22:20.425 --> 00:22:23.760
Hey. Of course I do.

232
00:23:20.618 --> 00:23:22.753
That belongs to me.

233
00:23:24.589 --> 00:23:26.191
What the hell?

234
00:23:27.425 --> 00:23:30.962
- Who are you?
- A good friend.


235
00:23:31.229 --> 00:23:34.465
- Now give me back the case.
- No.


236
00:23:35.066 --> 00:23:37.268
This belongs to the agency.

237
00:23:37.869 --> 00:23:39.304
Get back.

238
00:23:39.804 --> 00:23:41.139
I said step back!

239
00:23:42.874 --> 00:23:45.076
- He's back!
- Who the fuck are you?


240
00:23:45.210 --> 00:23:46.811
What the fuck do you want?

241
00:24:00.225 --> 00:24:02.160
This is what it's all about,
isn't it?


242
00:24:02.293 --> 00:24:04.429
This is what gives
you your power.


243
00:24:06.364 --> 00:24:08.933
Don't be a fool.
That won't work.


244
00:24:09.467 --> 00:24:12.237
Maybe not.
But I'll take that risk.


245
00:24:12.604 --> 00:24:14.806
I thought you were
our best agent.


246
00:24:14.939 --> 00:24:18.009
I am, and I always
finish the job.


247
00:25:09.994 --> 00:25:12.130
This is what it's all about.

248
00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:14.365
Information.

249
00:25:14.666 --> 00:25:16.434
That's the key to real power.

250
00:25:23.374 --> 00:25:24.776
Please!

251
00:25:24.909 --> 00:25:29.280
No, no, no!

252
00:26:45.623 --> 00:26:47.558
Mission accomplished.

253
00:26:48.493 --> 00:26:50.194
Proceed.

254
00:27:01.272 --> 00:27:03.341
Who's my next brain?

255
00:27:04.142 --> 00:27:06.611
A very important leader.

256
00:27:07.745 --> 00:27:11.215
You'll be surprised.

257
00:27:14.887 --> 00:27:16.687
Why am I being interrogated?

258
00:27:18.389 --> 00:27:21.225
I've got five dead bodies
to account for.


259
00:27:21.359 --> 00:27:23.528
One of them being
the agency director.


260
00:27:23.661 --> 00:27:25.963
The secretary of Defense
is breathing down my back


261
00:27:26.097 --> 00:27:28.533
and you're... the only survivor.

262
00:27:28.666 --> 00:27:31.002
- You think I did it?
- I ask the questions here.


263
00:27:31.135 --> 00:27:33.771
You answer them.
That's how it works.


264
00:27:33.906 --> 00:27:35.406
Understood.

265
00:27:38.643 --> 00:27:40.311
Now, someone dropped
the package off


266
00:27:40.445 --> 00:27:42.513
in the trunk of your
car last night.


267
00:27:42.848 --> 00:27:44.615
Who and what?

268
00:27:46.184 --> 00:27:48.352
He's a contact I have
in the Hope Ministries.


269
00:27:49.153 --> 00:27:51.489
It was blueprints
for his next camp.


270
00:27:52.990 --> 00:27:55.059
You went to see Stew Hern
last night.


271
00:27:55.193 --> 00:27:57.962
- Why?
- I never heard of him.


272
00:27:58.729 --> 00:28:01.299
What were you doing
in the parking garage?


273
00:28:01.432 --> 00:28:02.901
- My garage?
- The one in


274
00:28:03.034 --> 00:28:04.669
the apartment building
on Martel Street.


275
00:28:04.803 --> 00:28:07.438
- An agent saw you there.
- I've never been there.


276
00:28:07.572 --> 00:28:09.440
So you think the agent's lying?

277
00:28:10.041 --> 00:28:12.610
Maybe he thought he saw me,
but he was mistaken.


278
00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:17.482
How did you know
Number Three was dead?


279
00:28:18.951 --> 00:28:20.751
I wasn't aware of his death.

280
00:28:21.686 --> 00:28:23.221
Is that right?

281
00:28:23.354 --> 00:28:25.256
For your information,
his body was found


282
00:28:25.389 --> 00:28:28.292
on a park bench this morning
by the police in West Hollywood.


283
00:28:30.528 --> 00:28:32.196
How unfortunate.

284
00:28:36.334 --> 00:28:38.069
But you're sure Number Two
is dead.


285
00:28:38.202 --> 00:28:39.637
I saw his body!

286
00:28:40.104 --> 00:28:42.173
Who's Virgil Conway?

287
00:28:43.474 --> 00:28:45.209
The name doesn't
sound familiar.


288
00:28:45.343 --> 00:28:47.612
You know him. You reacted when
I mentioned his name,


289
00:28:47.745 --> 00:28:49.013
you weren't expecting it.

290
00:28:49.146 --> 00:28:50.448
I don't know a Virgil.

291
00:28:50.581 --> 00:28:52.350
You just don't know anything.
Do you?


292
00:28:52.483 --> 00:28:53.919
No.

293
00:28:54.218 --> 00:28:55.921
I have something
I think is going to help


294
00:28:56.053 --> 00:28:57.555
jar your memory.

295
00:29:11.402 --> 00:29:12.737
Apparently, I was wrong.

296
00:29:12.871 --> 00:29:15.007
Apparently so, now sit down.

297
00:29:19.076 --> 00:29:20.812
Wake up Number Two.

298
00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:24.215
I said, wake up Number Two.

299
00:29:25.516 --> 00:29:27.118
I think there's somebody here
you're really going


300
00:29:27.251 --> 00:29:28.786
to be surprised to see.

301
00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:31.088
Stop!

302
00:29:34.692 --> 00:29:37.395
Now why is it you two have
completely different versions


303
00:29:37.528 --> 00:29:39.463
about what went on last night?

304
00:29:40.032 --> 00:29:43.267
All I know is he killed
them all.


305
00:29:44.702 --> 00:29:46.470
Funny, he seems to
think you did.


306
00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:51.242
No way. Guy's a fricking freak.

307
00:29:53.077 --> 00:29:56.547
I shot him over and over again
and he didn't die.


308
00:29:57.148 --> 00:29:58.583
He killed them all.

309
00:30:00.284 --> 00:30:01.954
Number three and Jenna were
having an affair,


310
00:30:02.086 --> 00:30:03.588
you killed him in
a jealous rage.


311
00:30:03.721 --> 00:30:05.791
- No!
- I know people that would kill


312
00:30:05.924 --> 00:30:07.893
their own mother for $2 million.

313
00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:10.328
There was never any money
in the briefcase


314
00:30:10.461 --> 00:30:11.997
when I picked it up.

315
00:30:12.563 --> 00:30:14.800
- Money wasn't there.
- Bullshit!


316
00:30:14.933 --> 00:30:16.334
You have a clear motive.

317
00:30:16.467 --> 00:30:18.569
We have you on camera
entering the building.


318
00:30:18.703 --> 00:30:20.338
Now listen to me.

319
00:30:21.706 --> 00:30:25.376
He killed them all.
He killed Clay,


320
00:30:26.044 --> 00:30:28.613
and he went to the agency and
he killed the rest of them.


321
00:30:28.746 --> 00:30:31.215
I wasn't in the building.
I couldn't have done it.


322
00:30:32.516 --> 00:30:35.786
I can prove he's been
sabotaging our investigation


323
00:30:35.921 --> 00:30:37.755
- of Reverend Hope.
- You're desperate.


324
00:30:38.255 --> 00:30:39.825
All that money and
nowhere to go.


325
00:30:40.625 --> 00:30:44.228
Who are those two men
you met with yesterday


326
00:30:44.362 --> 00:30:46.163
from Future Corp?

327
00:30:46.297 --> 00:30:48.399
I don't know anyone from that
company.


328
00:30:51.202 --> 00:30:54.305
What about the pictures and
the documents I gave you?


329
00:30:54.438 --> 00:30:56.875
Number One has given me an
acceptable explanation


330
00:30:57.009 --> 00:30:58.576
for all of it.

331
00:30:58.709 --> 00:31:02.047
I have more, Hines. I have
enough to put this guy away.


332
00:31:02.413 --> 00:31:04.448
Produce the evidence.

333
00:31:04.582 --> 00:31:07.119
It was at my safe house.

334
00:31:07.853 --> 00:31:11.123
And I'm sure you took it after
you thought I was dead.


335
00:31:11.622 --> 00:31:14.258
But you have nothing to
back you up, Number Two.


336
00:31:14.492 --> 00:31:17.695
Christ. Can't you see
he set me up, Hines?


337
00:31:17.829 --> 00:31:21.033
Well, if he did, he did a pretty
goddamn good job of it.


338
00:31:21.165 --> 00:31:23.902
You were dead when we found
you, and now you're alive.


339
00:31:24.036 --> 00:31:28.205
- How?
- I don't know.


340
00:31:28.974 --> 00:31:30.441
"I don't know..."

341
00:31:31.642 --> 00:31:33.477
Excuse me, gentlemen.

342
00:31:41.119 --> 00:31:44.022
You're absolutely certain it
was Number One you saw driving


343
00:31:44.156 --> 00:31:45.589
into the apartment
on Martel?


344
00:31:46.024 --> 00:31:47.692
Positive.

345
00:31:51.063 --> 00:31:52.530
Take him out.

346
00:32:05.977 --> 00:32:07.511
What are you?

347
00:32:10.816 --> 00:32:12.683
The liquid you drank should
have killed you.


348
00:32:13.151 --> 00:32:15.954
- How did you survive?
- I don't... I don't know.


349
00:32:16.687 --> 00:32:21.159
- You feel different? Stronger?
- Yeah.


350
00:32:21.625 --> 00:32:24.328
Just like King fucking Kong!

351
00:32:26.564 --> 00:32:28.466
This presents an interesting
problem.


352
00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:31.169
You must come with me.
I won't hurt you.


353
00:32:31.302 --> 00:32:33.304
Yeah, right. Are you kidding me?

354
00:32:38.476 --> 00:32:40.244
Is that your best shot?

355
00:32:46.617 --> 00:32:49.453
The solution worked on you,
but not on the others.


356
00:32:51.089 --> 00:32:52.858
What others?

357
00:32:53.357 --> 00:32:55.227
I'm the only person
that can help you.


358
00:32:55.359 --> 00:32:56.594
Help me?

359
00:32:56.727 --> 00:32:58.496
You wanted to kill me.

360
00:32:58.629 --> 00:32:59.865
The liquid you drank
may kill you.


361
00:32:59.998 --> 00:33:01.900
I may be able to
save your life.


362
00:33:02.033 --> 00:33:04.535
Why save me? Last night
you wanted me dead.


363
00:33:04.870 --> 00:33:06.704
Come with me
and I will tell you.


364
00:33:08.439 --> 00:33:10.307
You can't kill me.

365
00:33:10.708 --> 00:33:12.443
You were so sure of yourself
last night.


366
00:33:12.576 --> 00:33:14.212
The way you toyed with me.

367
00:33:14.345 --> 00:33:15.713
But now you're afraid of me.

368
00:33:15.847 --> 00:33:18.582
I'm not afraid of you.
I want you alive.


369
00:33:19.084 --> 00:33:21.485
Yeah? Then come and get me.

370
00:33:23.521 --> 00:33:27.391
I will. Not now, but I will.

371
00:33:32.030 --> 00:33:35.867
That's it. After that,
my mind draws a blank.


372
00:33:36.201 --> 00:33:40.437
You will get it back. Patience.
Now we got to keep going.


373
00:33:40.571 --> 00:33:42.073
An old friend awaits us.

374
00:33:53.051 --> 00:33:54.485
Hold on to this.

375
00:34:00.158 --> 00:34:01.692
Cover your eyes.

376
00:34:25.783 --> 00:34:27.285
Hines.

377
00:34:27.418 --> 00:34:29.087
His clone actually.

378
00:34:29.620 --> 00:34:31.089
Sorry to have ordered
your execution,


379
00:34:31.223 --> 00:34:33.557
it was in the interest of
national security.


380
00:34:33.691 --> 00:34:35.659
Yeah, well, it looks like we
all screwed that one up


381
00:34:35.794 --> 00:34:37.394
real good, didn't we?

382
00:34:37.528 --> 00:34:39.931
As long as you are still alive,
there is half a chance.


383
00:34:40.065 --> 00:34:41.599
How is his memory now?

384
00:34:42.033 --> 00:34:44.269
Much better,
but he's not ready yet.


385
00:34:44.401 --> 00:34:45.669
Ready for what?

386
00:34:45.804 --> 00:34:47.738
You must recover
as much information


387
00:34:47.873 --> 00:34:50.208
as possible in order to
activate Virgil's message.


388
00:34:50.342 --> 00:34:52.443
- What message?
- We don't know.


389
00:34:52.576 --> 00:34:53.879
We were programmed
to bring you in


390
00:34:54.012 --> 00:34:55.847
once the radiation levels
had dropped.


391
00:34:58.116 --> 00:34:59.885
Computer is ready, sir.

392
00:35:08.159 --> 00:35:09.693
Take a seat, Garrett.

393
00:35:14.165 --> 00:35:15.666
So why me, Hines?

394
00:35:16.935 --> 00:35:20.205
You were exposed to chemical
warfare in the Persian Gulf.


395
00:35:20.972 --> 00:35:23.308
Your DNA mutated with the
alien supplement,


396
00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:25.076
providing you superior
strength.


397
00:35:25.709 --> 00:35:27.212
But as you found out,

398
00:35:28.213 --> 00:35:30.614
plenty of side effects
and certain death.


399
00:35:31.749 --> 00:35:33.550
- I see.
- You were just lucky to last


400
00:35:33.684 --> 00:35:35.987
a little bit longer
than the rest of the humans.


401
00:35:37.454 --> 00:35:38.990
I have
computer sync up, sir.


402
00:35:39.124 --> 00:35:41.092
Take us back into
your memories, Garett.


403
00:35:41.226 --> 00:35:42.526
The more you can remember,

404
00:35:42.660 --> 00:35:44.396
the more accurate Virgil's
message will be.


405
00:35:44.728 --> 00:35:46.898
Tell us about Virgil Conway.

406
00:36:09.620 --> 00:36:11.222
You're one unique man.

407
00:36:12.190 --> 00:36:14.159
You'd think I'd come out
here to paint the lake,


408
00:36:14.292 --> 00:36:15.827
or the hills?

409
00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:18.229
What are you going to call it?

410
00:36:18.797 --> 00:36:21.199
"Nobus At Peace."

411
00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:23.667
Nobus?

412
00:36:23.802 --> 00:36:25.569
Just a place I made up.

413
00:36:26.871 --> 00:36:29.040
A place in that wild
imagination of yours.


414
00:36:32.676 --> 00:36:34.212
I love it, Virgil.

415
00:36:46.324 --> 00:36:48.360
<i>You've been criticized
for using</i>


416
00:36:48.492 --> 00:36:51.963
charitable donations to build
a corporate empire.


417
00:36:52.097 --> 00:36:54.099
Why do you need all that money?

418
00:36:54.232 --> 00:36:56.500
I have never benefited
personally from the money.


419
00:36:57.235 --> 00:36:59.703
Money was going to various
charities.


420
00:37:00.271 --> 00:37:02.374
Also, my discovery camps.

421
00:37:02.539 --> 00:37:04.042
<i>Discovery camps?</i>

422
00:37:04.175 --> 00:37:08.146
Cities you will build, places
free from crime and hate.


423
00:37:09.214 --> 00:37:10.949
We will invite people
of all races,


424
00:37:11.082 --> 00:37:13.784
rich and poor alike as
brothers and sisters.


425
00:37:14.718 --> 00:37:17.588
We hope those
that do not follow God


426
00:37:17.721 --> 00:37:20.892
will come to our camps
and discover him.


427
00:37:21.026 --> 00:37:25.030
Those that have the faith will
be able to learn more.


428
00:37:25.163 --> 00:37:27.598
Situations like these always
end in tragedy.


429
00:37:27.731 --> 00:37:30.368
Jim Jones, Mercury Mason.

430
00:37:30.835 --> 00:37:32.536
I understand the criticism.

431
00:37:33.537 --> 00:37:37.242
These camps will not be
isolated like Mercury Mason's.


432
00:37:37.509 --> 00:37:40.644
<i>The people will be free to come
and go as they please.</i>


433
00:37:40.979 --> 00:37:43.781
I believe in trusting
the people on this Earth.


434
00:37:44.648 --> 00:37:46.418
I believe in their good nature.

435
00:37:47.318 --> 00:37:49.187
The people will govern
themselves.


436
00:37:49.686 --> 00:37:51.655
What are your ties with
Future Corp?


437
00:37:51.790 --> 00:37:54.859
I have none.
I have no need for computers.


438
00:37:55.659 --> 00:37:57.228
I was told you
have an announcement


439
00:37:57.362 --> 00:37:58.562
you would like to make.

440
00:37:58.695 --> 00:38:02.633
Unfortunately,
I have grave news.


441
00:38:03.401 --> 00:38:05.136
Five days from now,

442
00:38:05.270 --> 00:38:08.506
Southern California is going to
be devastated by an earthquake.


443
00:38:09.307 --> 00:38:11.575
<i>I believe it will be at
least an eight on the Ric...</i>


444
00:40:32.183 --> 00:40:34.519
You knew
you couldn't hide forever.


445
00:40:34.652 --> 00:40:35.987
How did you find me?

446
00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:38.556
Persistence.
Along with your sloppiness.


447
00:40:39.791 --> 00:40:42.694
Actually, we stopped looking
until you became an informant


448
00:40:42.827 --> 00:40:44.862
for the United States
government.


449
00:40:51.803 --> 00:40:53.238
Hey!

450
00:41:25.603 --> 00:41:27.305
The miracle will burn!

451
00:41:29.474 --> 00:41:30.908
Who are you?

452
00:41:31.442 --> 00:41:33.011
You're welcome.

453
00:41:33.144 --> 00:41:34.579
Why did you save me?

454
00:41:34.712 --> 00:41:36.780
- Did you set us up?
- Who?


455
00:41:37.248 --> 00:41:38.816
You're Clay's contact, right?

456
00:41:38.950 --> 00:41:41.686
Ah, your Clay's partner.

457
00:41:41.819 --> 00:41:44.122
I was. He's dead.

458
00:41:45.189 --> 00:41:47.458
I'm sorry. Stay there.

459
00:42:12.617 --> 00:42:14.419
I drank one of these puppies,
it nearly killed me.


460
00:42:14.552 --> 00:42:16.087
- Are you sure you drank this?
- Yeah.


461
00:42:16.220 --> 00:42:17.689
How did you get a hold of it?

462
00:42:17.822 --> 00:42:20.124
Came across it while
investigating another agent.


463
00:42:20.793 --> 00:42:22.360
I see. Help me here.

464
00:43:00.833 --> 00:43:02.367
Sorry about that.

465
00:43:05.838 --> 00:43:07.372
What the hell did
you do that for?


466
00:43:07.505 --> 00:43:09.440
I had to see if
you were telling the truth.


467
00:43:09.574 --> 00:43:11.476
The blue liquid you drank
is a diet supplement.


468
00:43:11.609 --> 00:43:13.878
It's supposed to help humans
improve their skills.


469
00:43:17.315 --> 00:43:18.916
So you shoot me in the chest?

470
00:43:19.050 --> 00:43:21.085
It hurts less than a gut shot.

471
00:43:21.219 --> 00:43:24.255
Yeah, well, don't ever
do anything like that again.


472
00:43:25.890 --> 00:43:27.759
So, how's this supplement
supposed to improve my skills?


473
00:43:27.892 --> 00:43:30.128
And by the way, where
the hell do you come from?


474
00:43:30.261 --> 00:43:32.330
I come from the planet Nobus.

475
00:43:32.463 --> 00:43:35.299
Great, another fucking alien.

476
00:43:35.834 --> 00:43:39.070
So which one are you?
E.T. or The Terminator?


477
00:43:39.203 --> 00:43:41.339
Neither. Morrucan.

478
00:43:42.373 --> 00:43:43.809
All right, moving on.

479
00:43:43.975 --> 00:43:45.443
You don't sound too surprised.

480
00:43:45.878 --> 00:43:48.212
With all the shit
I've seen in the last 48 hours,


481
00:43:48.346 --> 00:43:49.747
I believe just about anything.

482
00:43:49.882 --> 00:43:51.382
Well, there's more.

483
00:43:51.516 --> 00:43:53.852
The supplement will increase
your strength tenfold.


484
00:43:54.218 --> 00:43:56.120
Unfortunately,
I don't know its side effects.


485
00:43:56.254 --> 00:43:57.922
They've been testing it
on humans.


486
00:43:58.055 --> 00:43:59.690
No survivors.

487
00:43:59.991 --> 00:44:02.760
We need it in order to adapt
to this planet's atmosphere.


488
00:44:02.895 --> 00:44:04.830
A sip and we feel rejuvenated.

489
00:44:05.363 --> 00:44:07.064
So why test it on a human?

490
00:44:07.198 --> 00:44:08.599
I can't explain it all now.

491
00:44:08.867 --> 00:44:12.069
Piak, Number One to you,
is going to start wondering


492
00:44:12.203 --> 00:44:14.172
why they haven't
reported back yet.


493
00:44:15.473 --> 00:44:16.909
Time to explore.

494
00:44:29.253 --> 00:44:31.022
This is amazing.

495
00:44:32.089 --> 00:44:33.724
Is there any information
here we can use?


496
00:44:34.392 --> 00:44:35.660
We?

497
00:44:36.527 --> 00:44:38.463
I'll have to look at this later.

498
00:44:38.831 --> 00:44:40.298
All right, fine.

499
00:44:40.899 --> 00:44:43.267
So what is Reverend Hope's
part in all of this?


500
00:44:43.501 --> 00:44:46.170
He's a human puppet
controlled by the alien boss.


501
00:44:46.304 --> 00:44:49.740
Alien boss?
Yes. Allatarek.


502
00:44:50.508 --> 00:44:52.577
He's been their leader ever
since he arrived on my planet.


503
00:44:52.710 --> 00:44:54.378
Wait a minute.

504
00:44:54.512 --> 00:44:56.681
You're telling me that
he's an alien to you also?


505
00:44:56.815 --> 00:44:58.349
He tried to control our planet

506
00:44:58.483 --> 00:45:00.618
just like he's trying
to take over yours.


507
00:45:01.118 --> 00:45:02.587
What? He's trying
to conquer Earth?


508
00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:05.423
Not completely.
He just wants to use you.


509
00:45:06.090 --> 00:45:08.726
He wants Earth's raw materials
and its manufacturing


510
00:45:08.861 --> 00:45:11.362
infrastructure to build
ships and weapons.


511
00:45:11.496 --> 00:45:14.465
He wants your
population as soldiers.


512
00:45:14.900 --> 00:45:17.836
He plans on going back to
Nobus and continuing his war.


513
00:45:18.336 --> 00:45:21.639
Number One, Piak,
works for him.


514
00:45:22.173 --> 00:45:24.442
He was the most dangerous
terrorist on Nobus.


515
00:45:24.575 --> 00:45:26.912
His group had killed
thousands of people.


516
00:45:27.578 --> 00:45:29.882
One day this
Allatarek appeared


517
00:45:30.381 --> 00:45:33.117
and Piak allied with him.

518
00:45:34.385 --> 00:45:36.420
It's pretty bizarre
you'd have terrorism on a planet


519
00:45:36.554 --> 00:45:38.089
that's so advanced like yours.

520
00:45:38.222 --> 00:45:39.825
Just because technology
improves,


521
00:45:39.958 --> 00:45:42.026
doesn't mean people
improve along with it.


522
00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:46.397
True. So, does this
Allatarek control Piak?


523
00:45:46.531 --> 00:45:48.299
He, convinced Piak
he was sent to him


524
00:45:48.432 --> 00:45:49.935
from there, God, Allalak.

525
00:45:50.468 --> 00:45:52.236
He gained his trust.

526
00:46:00.344 --> 00:46:01.880
Help me get these guys
to the truck.


527
00:46:02.014 --> 00:46:03.648
Is it over yet?
Are they dead?


528
00:46:03.781 --> 00:46:06.217
In order to kill them, you
must first erase their brains,


529
00:46:06.717 --> 00:46:08.586
then cremate them.

530
00:46:11.924 --> 00:46:13.491
So how did you stop Allatarek?

531
00:46:13.624 --> 00:46:16.360
I infiltrated their group
and given away their position.


532
00:46:16.494 --> 00:46:19.230
We bombed them and destroyed
most of their facilities.


533
00:46:19.363 --> 00:46:20.698
He realized he couldn't win,

534
00:46:20.832 --> 00:46:22.567
but he still wanted
a piece of Nobus.


535
00:46:22.700 --> 00:46:24.368
An island the size
of your Africa


536
00:46:24.502 --> 00:46:26.038
the long part of the planet.

537
00:46:26.170 --> 00:46:27.672
He would use it to rebuild.

538
00:46:28.072 --> 00:46:30.675
He planned on attacking
our Temple of Thoughts.


539
00:46:30.809 --> 00:46:33.377
He wanted the community
of minds.


540
00:46:35.847 --> 00:46:38.316
Thoughts we've saved
of our great scientists,


541
00:46:38.449 --> 00:46:40.184
creative geniuses.

542
00:46:41.019 --> 00:46:42.653
Great minds that guide us.

543
00:46:50.628 --> 00:46:52.864
So how in the hell
did you get here?


544
00:46:52.998 --> 00:46:54.298
Oh, yeah, the good stuff.

545
00:46:54.866 --> 00:46:56.767
I informed my people
of their location.


546
00:46:56.902 --> 00:46:59.570
They bombed again, this time
with more powerful weapons.


547
00:47:00.038 --> 00:47:01.472
They destroyed everything.

548
00:47:02.808 --> 00:47:04.208
The terrorists also
discovered me,


549
00:47:04.342 --> 00:47:05.710
but didn't kill me.

550
00:47:05.844 --> 00:47:08.446
They took me with them to
the spaceship for ransom.


551
00:47:09.047 --> 00:47:10.348
Our navy was patrolling the area

552
00:47:10.481 --> 00:47:12.750
and was on them
the minute they took off.


553
00:47:13.317 --> 00:47:14.853
Cruisers pounded them.

554
00:47:15.486 --> 00:47:18.255
Damaged and desperate,
they headed out to space.


555
00:47:18.389 --> 00:47:20.291
The Navy was closing in.

556
00:47:21.626 --> 00:47:23.862
There was a dark matter
fold into space.


557
00:47:24.695 --> 00:47:27.198
Every probe we send through
there was destroyed.


558
00:47:27.531 --> 00:47:29.634
No one would even try
to take a ship through.


559
00:47:30.735 --> 00:47:33.671
Piak and this
Allatarek had no choice.


560
00:47:34.338 --> 00:47:36.108
We went through then
suddenly we're shot out


561
00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:37.809
at incredible speed.

562
00:47:38.175 --> 00:47:39.677
I was in restraints.

563
00:47:40.444 --> 00:47:43.180
We were thrown about the ship
and knocked unconscious.


564
00:47:44.315 --> 00:47:47.052
The computer system managed
to crash land the ship on Earth


565
00:47:47.184 --> 00:47:49.821
in a secure place
south of your continent.


566
00:47:53.091 --> 00:47:57.863
They put me in a gas chamber
and ejected me into the ocean.


567
00:48:00.264 --> 00:48:01.933
The machine didn't work.

568
00:48:03.267 --> 00:48:06.203
I was lucky.
I survived.


569
00:48:31.429 --> 00:48:32.663
Will you help me?

570
00:48:33.230 --> 00:48:36.134
I protected my world, it's
not my job to protect yours.


571
00:48:36.267 --> 00:48:38.036
I lost everything
I had fighting them,


572
00:48:38.170 --> 00:48:39.603
not this time.

573
00:48:39.737 --> 00:48:42.074
Why not? You can't go back
to the other aliens.


574
00:48:42.206 --> 00:48:44.408
You can't live amongst us
because we'll all be slaves.


575
00:48:44.542 --> 00:48:46.111
You have no place to go.

576
00:48:46.243 --> 00:48:48.679
They cannot control every piece
of land on this planet.


577
00:48:48.814 --> 00:48:50.715
I know of safe spots
that'll be left alone.


578
00:48:50.949 --> 00:48:53.751
It'll be a simple life.
But we'll be free.


579
00:48:54.618 --> 00:48:56.620
Who's we?
You and Rosa?


580
00:48:57.388 --> 00:48:58.857
How do you know about her?

581
00:48:59.690 --> 00:49:02.928
I have my sources.
After I fled the agency,


582
00:49:03.061 --> 00:49:07.565
I tracked you down, did my
homework and saved your life.


583
00:49:07.698 --> 00:49:09.500
- You think I owe you.
- Yeah.


584
00:49:09.801 --> 00:49:11.870
I didn't ask you to save me.
I don't owe you anything.


585
00:49:12.003 --> 00:49:13.637
I'll give you
what I have on them.


586
00:49:13.771 --> 00:49:15.807
You'll have to save
your world. Not me.


587
00:49:15.941 --> 00:49:18.309
Great. So, you're just
going to let us rot in slavery.


588
00:49:18.442 --> 00:49:19.945
Your people are going to
have to defend


589
00:49:20.078 --> 00:49:21.880
themselves like we did.

590
00:49:24.782 --> 00:49:26.517
But someone like you

591
00:49:26.650 --> 00:49:28.252
could give us the chance
we need to survive.


592
00:49:28.385 --> 00:49:30.454
- You can't stop him.
- But you did.


593
00:49:30.588 --> 00:49:32.224
There's nothing I can do now.

594
00:49:32.456 --> 00:49:34.492
Nothing you can do or will do?

595
00:49:34.725 --> 00:49:36.228
All right, then there's
nothing I will do.


596
00:49:36.360 --> 00:49:37.762
You can waste your time with me,

597
00:49:37.896 --> 00:49:39.597
or you can spend it
trying to stop them.


598
00:49:39.730 --> 00:49:41.766
That's bullshit.
Once they're done with us here,


599
00:49:41.900 --> 00:49:44.870
they'll return to Nobus
and finish what they started.


600
00:49:45.436 --> 00:49:47.671
You'd be best off
going to a safe area.


601
00:49:47.806 --> 00:49:50.108
Take your family with you.
It's your only chance.


602
00:49:50.242 --> 00:49:52.043
Give me the keys to your car.

603
00:49:52.177 --> 00:49:54.678
I'll give you a ride in the
city. That's all you're getting.


604
00:50:14.065 --> 00:50:15.967
So is it official?

605
00:50:16.101 --> 00:50:19.637
<i>The rumors are expected
to become official in minutes.</i>


606
00:50:19.871 --> 00:50:21.973
<i>If it is confirmed,
we are witnessing</i>


607
00:50:22.107 --> 00:50:24.876
<i>the first major assassination
of the new millennium.</i>


608
00:50:25.309 --> 00:50:28.746
<i>It is a great loss for mankind.
It is a terrible moment.</i>


609
00:50:29.147 --> 00:50:32.483
Is there any word yet
on who is responsible?


610
00:50:32.951 --> 00:50:34.953
<i>They say it's the work
of one man,</i>


611
00:50:35.086 --> 00:50:37.856
<i>someone unknown to
the Vatican's inner circle</i>


612
00:50:37.989 --> 00:50:39.925
<i>or to the Pope's group
of advisers.</i>


613
00:50:40.292 --> 00:50:42.160
<i>Apparently he disappeared
mysteriously.</i>


614
00:51:04.950 --> 00:51:09.620
Virgil?

615
00:51:10.354 --> 00:51:12.356
Virgil?

616
00:51:16.161 --> 00:51:17.361
Virgil?

617
00:51:28.974 --> 00:51:30.507
Virgil?

618
00:51:30.641 --> 00:51:32.811
Virgil's fine but he won't be
back for a while.


619
00:51:32.944 --> 00:51:34.045
Who are you?

620
00:51:34.179 --> 00:51:35.847
It's all right,
I'm not here to hurt you.


621
00:51:35.981 --> 00:51:37.849
- I'm a government agent.
- Get out of my house, okay?


622
00:51:37.983 --> 00:51:39.583
I have something very important
to show you, please!


623
00:51:39.717 --> 00:51:41.452
Please, it's very important.
Wait.


624
00:51:42.087 --> 00:51:43.587
It's about Virgil.

625
00:51:45.223 --> 00:51:48.260
- What do you want from Virgil?
- He's in serious trouble.


626
00:51:48.392 --> 00:51:53.098
We're all in serious trouble.
You need to watch this.


627
00:51:54.032 --> 00:51:55.466
Please.

628
00:52:07.045 --> 00:52:09.780
Not completely.
He just wants to use you.


629
00:52:09.915 --> 00:52:13.051
He wants Earth's raw materials
and its manufacturing


630
00:52:13.184 --> 00:52:15.954
infrastructure to
build ships and weapons.


631
00:52:16.420 --> 00:52:18.823
He wants your population
as soldiers.


632
00:52:19.190 --> 00:52:20.792
This is fake, okay?

633
00:52:20.926 --> 00:52:23.895
I couldn't fake this.
If so, why is this truck here?


634
00:52:24.029 --> 00:52:25.729
Where's Virgil?

635
00:52:26.865 --> 00:52:28.333
This is my ID card.

636
00:52:28.465 --> 00:52:31.169
Contact SciTech, they'll
confirm everything with you.


637
00:52:32.370 --> 00:52:34.139
I don't trust you. Okay?

638
00:52:34.272 --> 00:52:38.475
This is fake.
Get off my property. Now!


639
00:52:43.815 --> 00:52:45.582
You didn't need to involve her!

640
00:52:45.716 --> 00:52:46.885
You gave me no choice!

641
00:52:47.018 --> 00:52:48.619
I should erase your thoughts

642
00:52:48.752 --> 00:52:50.587
and replace them
with those of a cockroach.


643
00:52:50.721 --> 00:52:52.090
Virgil, listen,

644
00:52:52.223 --> 00:52:54.658
if they can find you,
they can find her.


645
00:52:56.361 --> 00:53:00.764
- You're not an alien!
- Come on, Virgil, it can't be!


646
00:53:00.899 --> 00:53:03.268
- I'm sorry, I love you.
- You are sorry?


647
00:53:03.401 --> 00:53:05.136
You are sorry?
You love me?


648
00:53:05.270 --> 00:53:08.406
Please, Rosa.
I can explain. I love you.


649
00:53:08.539 --> 00:53:10.375
Virgil, get away from me!

650
00:53:11.042 --> 00:53:14.678
Rosa. Rosa,
you could be in danger!


651
00:53:16.181 --> 00:53:17.614
Shit!

652
00:53:20.885 --> 00:53:23.388
You don't understand.
She's all I have in this world.


653
00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:25.890
Give me back my car keys.
I can't do that.


654
00:53:33.999 --> 00:53:35.900
She'll be fine as long
as we work together,


655
00:53:36.034 --> 00:53:38.569
and the sooner we act,
the better it is for everybody.


656
00:53:38.702 --> 00:53:40.438
I should kill you.

657
00:53:40.571 --> 00:53:43.274
In order for you to help Rosa,
you have to help me.


658
00:53:44.042 --> 00:53:45.877
I can find Rosa on my own.

659
00:53:46.011 --> 00:53:49.613
True. What if Piak finds
her first somehow?


660
00:53:50.415 --> 00:53:52.783
You wouldn't give them
that kind of advantage.


661
00:53:52.917 --> 00:53:55.786
But that's exactly what
you're doing by not helping me.


662
00:53:57.122 --> 00:53:59.723
Mind your temper,
remember, we're equals.


663
00:53:59.858 --> 00:54:01.692
All I have to do
is get away from you.


664
00:54:01.826 --> 00:54:05.463
Filthy earthling.
I hope you're the first slave.


665
00:54:05.596 --> 00:54:07.232
Maybe Rosa will be.

666
00:54:09.300 --> 00:54:11.568
Sorry, I didn't want to have
to do things this way,


667
00:54:11.702 --> 00:54:13.204
but you left me no choice.

668
00:54:16.341 --> 00:54:20.412
I'll help you for now,
but I'm telling you will fail.


669
00:54:21.279 --> 00:54:23.381
What? Did they teach you
that in the Morrucan Army?


670
00:54:24.282 --> 00:54:27.986
Okay, let's check
the computer one more time.


671
00:54:35.427 --> 00:54:38.329
- What is it?
- It's a message.


672
00:54:39.596 --> 00:54:42.733
For us.
From Piak.


673
00:54:45.636 --> 00:54:49.640
- He has Rosa.
- No way.


674
00:54:56.580 --> 00:54:58.983
He also assassinated the Pope.

675
00:54:59.984 --> 00:55:02.020
Hello, gentlemen.

676
00:55:03.855 --> 00:55:06.157
You can't kill me, remember?

677
00:55:06.757 --> 00:55:08.326
I wouldn't bet on
that if I were you.


678
00:55:08.460 --> 00:55:11.628
Save it for later.
I need a favor from you.


679
00:55:11.762 --> 00:55:13.965
- Where's Rosa?
- Relax, Morrucan.


680
00:55:14.365 --> 00:55:17.102
She's fine.
I think she's enjoying


681
00:55:17.235 --> 00:55:18.602
her connection to the computer.

682
00:55:18.735 --> 00:55:20.637
You bastard.

683
00:55:23.041 --> 00:55:25.810
Wait a minute. 
Let him finish.

684
00:55:26.677 --> 00:55:29.613
Good. Now, listen carefully.

685
00:55:31.116 --> 00:55:34.618
Two days from now, Reverend
Hope will be in New York.


686
00:55:35.220 --> 00:55:37.021
He'll be staying
at the Plaza Hotel.


687
00:55:37.489 --> 00:55:40.358
He'll be in his room
between five and six o'clock,


688
00:55:40.492 --> 00:55:43.428
accompanied by only
five human bodyguards.


689
00:55:43.995 --> 00:55:48.266
At exactly 5:37,
you will shoot him in the chest.


690
00:55:48.833 --> 00:55:52.904
You'll make sure he dies. 5:37.

691
00:55:53.238 --> 00:55:56.274
Not a minute before,
not a minute after.


692
00:55:57.075 --> 00:56:01.279
You fail,
Rosa becomes my personal slave.


693
00:56:05.049 --> 00:56:07.318
Sooner or later, Piak.

694
00:56:08.520 --> 00:56:10.088
I can't wait.

695
00:56:11.523 --> 00:56:13.158
Goodbye for now, gentlemen.

696
00:56:17.428 --> 00:56:20.165
Why in the hell is
he betraying Allatarek?


697
00:56:20.999 --> 00:56:23.067
I believe it's because of you.

698
00:56:54.265 --> 00:56:57.135
- Garrett.
- God bless you.


699
00:56:57.936 --> 00:56:59.770
Now, that wasn't that hard,
was it?


700
00:57:00.338 --> 00:57:02.674
Remembering the past
is the easy part.


701
00:57:03.308 --> 00:57:05.476
Accepting the fact
that everyone's gone?


702
00:57:07.378 --> 00:57:08.980
I don't think
I'm prepared for this.


703
00:57:09.113 --> 00:57:11.950
Don't blame yourself.
Nobody saw it coming.


704
00:57:12.283 --> 00:57:14.352
Reverend Hope and Piak
worked hard to find


705
00:57:14.485 --> 00:57:16.821
a human that would survive
the DNA experiments.


706
00:57:16.955 --> 00:57:18.856
They made a big mistake
letting you go.


707
00:57:18.990 --> 00:57:20.491
They never saw your potential.

708
00:57:20.625 --> 00:57:23.228
All these centuries,
Piak has been heavily patrolling


709
00:57:23.361 --> 00:57:27.065
this planet, looking for you or
waiting for us to bring you in.


710
00:57:28.032 --> 00:57:29.834
We have been protecting
you for all this time.


711
00:57:30.501 --> 00:57:33.737
Earth was heavily contaminated,
so we had to wait.


712
00:57:33.871 --> 00:57:36.374
How in the hell
did we let this happen?


713
00:57:36.608 --> 00:57:37.774
There's no time for regrets.

714
00:57:37.909 --> 00:57:39.444
If Piak captures you,

715
00:57:39.577 --> 00:57:42.113
he will clone you
and create an invincible army.


716
00:57:43.548 --> 00:57:44.949
So what now?

717
00:57:45.183 --> 00:57:48.419
Over here, your palm
will activate the message.


718
00:57:58.329 --> 00:57:59.931
<i>Welcome back, Garrett.</i>

719
00:58:00.064 --> 00:58:01.966
<i>I'm glad you're still
in one piece.</i>


720
00:58:02.533 --> 00:58:04.602
<i>These have been some
tough years.</i>


721
00:58:04.736 --> 00:58:06.337
<i>You were right.</i>

722
00:58:06.471 --> 00:58:08.439
<i>I should have cared much
earlier about your planet.</i>


723
00:58:08.573 --> 00:58:11.909
<i>I am sorry I couldn't stop
the war on time.</i>


724
00:58:12.644 --> 00:58:14.545
<i>You have suffered
a great memory loss</i>


725
00:58:14.679 --> 00:58:16.881
<i>due to the alien
supplement you drank.</i>


726
00:58:17.615 --> 00:58:19.884
<i>When your body couldn't
resist it much longer</i>


727
00:58:20.018 --> 00:58:21.819
<i>and your death was inevitable,</i>

728
00:58:21.953 --> 00:58:25.957
<i>I decided to preserve your life
and await your resurrection.</i>


729
00:58:26.090 --> 00:58:28.192
<i>The community of
agreed</i>


730
00:58:28.326 --> 00:58:30.595
<i>that we should give
humanity a second chance,</i>


731
00:58:30.895 --> 00:58:33.131
<i>and they have planned
something special for you.</i>


732
00:58:33.498 --> 00:58:37.135
<i>Not far from here,
there is a hidden city.</i>


733
00:58:37.268 --> 00:58:39.871
<i>Inside the city,
there is a palace.</i>


734
00:58:40.405 --> 00:58:44.375
<i>Your destiny awaits you there.
Good luck to you, old friend.</i>


735
00:58:44.509 --> 00:58:47.145
<i>I am transmitting
the location now.</i>


736
00:59:01.059 --> 00:59:05.029
I got it. I know the way.

737
00:59:05.163 --> 00:59:07.231
Excellent.
We must be on the way then.


738
00:59:07.365 --> 00:59:11.569
Well, well, well.
Just like a class reunion.


739
00:59:12.203 --> 00:59:13.871
SciTech Agents united.

740
00:59:14.372 --> 00:59:18.176
Piak. I should have
killed you myself.


741
00:59:18.309 --> 00:59:20.845
No, sir,
I'm going to kill you this time.


742
00:59:20.978 --> 00:59:22.480
I got him, sir.

743
00:59:29.554 --> 00:59:32.690
I killed you once,
and I'll kill you again,


744
00:59:32.825 --> 00:59:34.425
and I'll kill your clones

745
00:59:34.559 --> 00:59:37.128
and the clones of
your clones as I please.


746
00:59:37.762 --> 00:59:39.230
This is my planet now,

747
00:59:39.364 --> 00:59:41.632
and I will rule it
without any interference.


748
00:59:41.766 --> 00:59:43.000
I'm your interference now.

749
00:59:43.134 --> 00:59:44.435
What the hell
were you thinking


750
00:59:44.569 --> 00:59:46.304
when you destroyed
the entire planet?


751
00:59:46.437 --> 00:59:48.306
Come here and I'll kill you
with my bare hands.


752
00:59:48.439 --> 00:59:51.409
Don't get emotional on me now.
Just make it easy for everybody.


753
00:59:51.542 --> 00:59:52.877
Just surrender.

754
00:59:53.010 --> 00:59:56.981
- Not likely.
- Look at you now, old man.


755
00:59:58.182 --> 00:59:59.584
I've waited a long
time to find you.


756
00:59:59.717 --> 01:00:01.586
Well, I'm not going
anywhere without a fight.


757
01:00:01.719 --> 01:00:04.622
Get out of here, boys. I'll
handle these puppets myself.


758
01:00:28.746 --> 01:00:30.214
Are you okay?

759
01:00:31.549 --> 01:00:34.485
I think so, but I'm feeling
kind of weird again.


760
01:00:37.588 --> 01:00:39.957
This is the last supplement
we have left.


761
01:00:43.194 --> 01:00:44.562
Blue liquid.

762
01:00:44.695 --> 01:00:46.330
Gotta love this stuff.

763
01:00:46.799 --> 01:00:48.533
You're welcome.

764
01:00:59.243 --> 01:01:00.879
You think Piak's dead?

765
01:01:01.012 --> 01:01:03.448
He's getting stronger
every minute.


766
01:01:03.948 --> 01:01:05.316
We can't take any chances.

767
01:01:05.450 --> 01:01:06.885
Well, in that case, follow me.

768
01:01:07.018 --> 01:01:09.253
I know where the hidden
palace is.


769
01:01:20.498 --> 01:01:23.468
- There.
- There's nothing there.


770
01:01:24.101 --> 01:01:26.404
Can't you see it?
It's right there. Come on.


771
01:01:29.173 --> 01:01:32.143
- You see it now?
- No.


772
01:01:32.276 --> 01:01:33.744
You got a gun?

773
01:01:44.355 --> 01:01:46.190
Un-fucking-believable.

774
01:01:46.324 --> 01:01:48.159
- Let's go.
- Let's go.


775
01:03:54.086 --> 01:03:57.521
Welcome.
We've been expecting you.


776
01:03:58.422 --> 01:03:59.690
And you are?

777
01:03:59.825 --> 01:04:04.830
I am Queen Ilona.
And you are my guest.


778
01:04:05.329 --> 01:04:06.664
Queen of who exactly?

779
01:04:07.198 --> 01:04:12.004
My planet was devastated like
yours by Piak and his army.


780
01:04:12.938 --> 01:04:15.272
The community of mines
have brought us here


781
01:04:15.406 --> 01:04:17.809
to rebuild our society.

782
01:04:17.943 --> 01:04:19.644
So why am I here?

783
01:04:19.777 --> 01:04:22.914
You are the reason
this palace exists.


784
01:04:23.648 --> 01:04:27.251
You are the one
who will save mankind.


785
01:04:27.785 --> 01:04:30.755
I don't recall applying
for that job.


786
01:04:30.889 --> 01:04:32.757
A gift was given to you.

787
01:04:32.891 --> 01:04:37.328
Your survival will give the
human race a second chance.


788
01:04:37.461 --> 01:04:39.064
I don't quite understand.

789
01:04:39.196 --> 01:04:40.665
You will.

790
01:04:41.499 --> 01:04:42.934
We're running out of time.

791
01:04:43.068 --> 01:04:46.470
Ladies, please escort
our guest to his room.


792
01:04:46.872 --> 01:04:49.740
Make sure he gets ready
for the ceremony.


793
01:04:49.875 --> 01:04:51.676
Ceremony?

794
01:04:51.810 --> 01:04:55.680
This might sound strange,
but a ceremony must take place


795
01:04:55.814 --> 01:05:00.685
in order for the community of
mines to send you back in time.


796
01:05:01.185 --> 01:05:02.586
Back in time?

797
01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:05.891
Yes, you will be travelling
soon.


798
01:05:39.523 --> 01:05:42.794
Now, let's get
the ceremony started.


799
01:05:43.227 --> 01:05:44.762
When the light comes,

800
01:05:44.896 --> 01:05:49.000
you must plunge this
dagger into your heart.


801
01:05:50.634 --> 01:05:52.503
Yeah, right.
That sounds like a great plan.


802
01:05:52.636 --> 01:05:56.041
Your sacrifice
will save your world.


803
01:05:56.174 --> 01:05:57.508
Look, Queen. I'm sorry,

804
01:05:57.641 --> 01:05:59.010
I don't mean to rain
on your parade,


805
01:05:59.144 --> 01:06:00.846
but I've been buried
a few hundred years,


806
01:06:00.979 --> 01:06:02.713
I haven't got
my memory back yet.


807
01:06:02.848 --> 01:06:05.183
And you expect me
to commit suicide,


808
01:06:05.316 --> 01:06:08.252
travel back through time
so I can save the human race?


809
01:06:08.385 --> 01:06:12.224
- Exactly.
- And if I don't?


810
01:06:12.356 --> 01:06:15.193
There is not much life
left in you.


811
01:06:15.659 --> 01:06:18.063
It is the only way
to save your planet


812
01:06:18.196 --> 01:06:20.832
and change this dark future.

813
01:06:22.033 --> 01:06:24.301
My queen, the army
has surrounded the temple.


814
01:06:24.435 --> 01:06:26.537
The shield won't resist
much longer.


815
01:06:35.947 --> 01:06:37.748
Let's do something!

816
01:06:37.883 --> 01:06:40.718
We are not warriors,
we have no weapons.


817
01:06:40.852 --> 01:06:42.954
Great,
you're going to get slaughtered.


818
01:06:43.454 --> 01:06:45.257
Why don't I just
turn myself over?


819
01:06:45.389 --> 01:06:47.391
No, you can't do that.

820
01:06:47.525 --> 01:06:49.293
You must fulfill your destiny.

821
01:06:49.426 --> 01:06:51.729
We must get the ceremony
started.


822
01:06:51.863 --> 01:06:54.365
I'd rather just fight them.

823
01:07:36.174 --> 01:07:38.109
Stay down. Get down.

824
01:07:52.891 --> 01:07:54.793
Glad you could join the party.

825
01:07:55.026 --> 01:07:56.393
Who's the lady?

826
01:07:56.527 --> 01:07:58.997
Queen Ilona,
meet your savior, Tony.


827
01:07:59.530 --> 01:08:01.432
Thank you for your help.

828
01:08:01.732 --> 01:08:04.501
Once this is over,
you will be rewarded.


829
01:08:04.635 --> 01:08:07.571
- Thanks.
- Not bad for a clone.


830
01:08:08.340 --> 01:08:10.541
- Is there another way out?
- No.


831
01:08:10.976 --> 01:08:12.310
Yes, there is.

832
01:08:12.443 --> 01:08:13.945
Let's give 'em some hell.

833
01:08:14.478 --> 01:08:16.714
- Stay here.
- Ready?


834
01:08:41.405 --> 01:08:43.108
Piak!

835
01:09:15.206 --> 01:09:16.975
No.

836
01:09:19.878 --> 01:09:21.612
Ilona?

837
01:09:23.614 --> 01:09:27.718
The light...
it's coming for us all.


838
01:09:37.162 --> 01:09:38.964
Erase his thoughts.

839
01:10:33.818 --> 01:10:36.187
Interesting.

840
01:10:39.057 --> 01:10:40.758
You're next.

841
01:10:40.892 --> 01:10:42.726
Did you have a nice nap?

842
01:10:43.061 --> 01:10:44.561
Get enough rest?

843
01:10:44.695 --> 01:10:47.365
Oh, and by the way,
sorry about your planet.


844
01:10:47.932 --> 01:10:49.501
Just taking care of business.

845
01:10:49.633 --> 01:10:51.469
Terrorism business?

846
01:10:51.870 --> 01:10:54.139
Slaughtering millions of people?

847
01:10:54.439 --> 01:10:56.408
Destroying an entire planet?

848
01:10:56.740 --> 01:10:59.144
You're going to pay
big time for it, Piak.


849
01:10:59.610 --> 01:11:01.612
You're the last survivor
of a weak race,


850
01:11:01.745 --> 01:11:03.381
you have nowhere to run now.

851
01:11:04.015 --> 01:11:06.885
Who's running?
Your time's up.


852
01:11:07.452 --> 01:11:09.320
And what makes you
think you can beat me?


853
01:11:09.454 --> 01:11:13.158
You're one small alien
on the wrong planet


854
01:11:13.291 --> 01:11:15.293
at the wrong time.

855
01:11:17.962 --> 01:11:19.696
I'll make you a deal.

856
01:11:21.199 --> 01:11:24.169
You give me your DNA sequence
and I'll let you live.


857
01:11:24.869 --> 01:11:26.570
I'll even spare
a few of these women.


858
01:11:26.703 --> 01:11:28.173
You can start a family.

859
01:11:28.907 --> 01:11:32.143
Nice offer.
But I've got a better plan.


860
01:11:32.643 --> 01:11:34.645
How about we travel
back through time


861
01:11:34.778 --> 01:11:36.680
and you die in the process?

862
01:11:37.382 --> 01:11:40.552
So many years and you haven't
lost that sense of humor.


863
01:11:40.919 --> 01:11:42.719
Remember, you can't kill me.

864
01:11:43.354 --> 01:11:46.157
I am what you humans call
"immortal."


865
01:11:46.524 --> 01:11:50.895
And you... you were the prototype
of a new breed,


866
01:11:51.262 --> 01:11:54.399
a new race that
will make my army stronger.


867
01:11:55.166 --> 01:11:58.937
You humans,
the missing link in my quest.


868
01:11:59.070 --> 01:12:02.841
Well, keep dreaming, Piak.

869
01:12:46.551 --> 01:12:48.119
I gave you a chance.

870
01:14:32.023 --> 01:14:34.092
Show time.

871
01:17:00.705 --> 01:17:02.907
Good morning.

872
01:17:10.248 --> 01:17:11.749
Where are we?

873
01:17:11.884 --> 01:17:14.419
I found you outside
the house last night naked


874
01:17:14.552 --> 01:17:17.522
and you had a wound
to your chest.


875
01:17:19.257 --> 01:17:20.793
Don't you remember?

876
01:17:20.925 --> 01:17:25.263
And who are you and what are
you doing on my claim?


877
01:17:27.498 --> 01:17:29.667
I'm sorry, I can't remember.

878
01:17:31.035 --> 01:17:33.037
Um...

879
01:17:35.773 --> 01:17:40.111
I'm a little confused.
Where are we exactly?


880
01:17:40.244 --> 01:17:43.514
Tombstone, Arizona Territory.

881
01:17:45.550 --> 01:17:48.653
Seriously?
Of all the places,


882
01:17:48.786 --> 01:17:51.322
I get stuck in a tourist trap.

883
01:17:52.457 --> 01:17:55.460
We don't get many
tourists around here.


884
01:17:56.327 --> 01:18:00.631
Just prospectors...
like my late husband,


885
01:18:00.765 --> 01:18:03.634
and thirsty cowboys.

886
01:18:07.772 --> 01:18:11.542
- What year is it?
- 1880.


887
01:18:13.946 --> 01:18:15.746
Look, um...

888
01:18:16.681 --> 01:18:18.416
I want to thank you
for your hospitality,


889
01:18:18.549 --> 01:18:20.819
but I got to get out of here.
I got to go.


890
01:18:20.953 --> 01:18:22.620
Go where?

891
01:18:22.753 --> 01:18:25.189
I got to go to the authorities
to figure all this out.


892
01:18:25.323 --> 01:18:28.827
Perhaps Sheriff Clark
can help you?


893
01:18:29.994 --> 01:18:33.698
If you're going to do that,
you'll need better clothing.


894
01:18:33.832 --> 01:18:35.366
Yes, please.

895
01:18:35.500 --> 01:18:40.104
I think you're about the same
size as my late husband.


896
01:18:41.339 --> 01:18:43.140
Here, take these.

897
01:18:43.274 --> 01:18:46.244
All right.
Thank you for your hospitality.


898
01:18:46.377 --> 01:18:47.946
What... What's your name?

899
01:18:48.112 --> 01:18:51.749
- Carol.
- Carol. I'm Garrett.


900
01:18:52.617 --> 01:18:53.751
Nice to meet you.

901
01:18:53.886 --> 01:18:57.121
Pleasure to meet you
and thank you very much,


902
01:18:57.255 --> 01:18:59.457
but I got to get going.

903
01:19:45.703 --> 01:19:46.905
Sheriff.

904
01:19:54.679 --> 01:19:56.414
Sheriff.

905
01:19:59.617 --> 01:20:01.218
You ain't from around here.

906
01:20:01.352 --> 01:20:02.854
Funny you should say that,

907
01:20:02.988 --> 01:20:04.957
because I'm definitely
not from around here.


908
01:20:05.089 --> 01:20:06.858
Well, where are you coming from?

909
01:20:07.258 --> 01:20:09.293
I can't really say,

910
01:20:09.795 --> 01:20:12.798
but I need to confirm that
you are who you say you are


911
01:20:12.931 --> 01:20:15.733
and that we are where
you believe we are.


912
01:20:17.836 --> 01:20:19.537
I don't follow you there.

913
01:20:19.670 --> 01:20:21.772
You better start talking,
who are you?


914
01:20:21.907 --> 01:20:25.409
Okay. I am from the future.

915
01:20:25.811 --> 01:20:27.511
Your future.

916
01:20:27.645 --> 01:20:31.248
But something happened and I
wasn't supposed to end up here.


917
01:20:31.850 --> 01:20:33.484
But where
are you supposed to be?


918
01:20:33.618 --> 01:20:36.587
That's not important.
My name is Garrett Brown.


919
01:20:36.721 --> 01:20:38.723
I'm a special agent
for the U.S. government,


920
01:20:38.857 --> 01:20:41.459
and I need to speak to the
president as soon as possible.


921
01:20:43.361 --> 01:20:45.596
We don't go for that
crazy talk around here.


922
01:20:45.998 --> 01:20:47.833
I think you're
going to need to stay here


923
01:20:47.966 --> 01:20:49.133
until we figure out who you are.

924
01:20:49.266 --> 01:20:51.335
Lock him up, boys.

925
01:21:13.190 --> 01:21:16.128
<i>El diablo!
El diablo!</i>


926
01:21:16.260 --> 01:21:18.696
Don't know how the hell
that happened.


927
01:21:19.430 --> 01:21:22.266
Haul him back to the jail,
lock him up.


928
01:21:39.717 --> 01:21:42.888
You boys clear out. I need
to talk to this man alone.


929
01:21:53.065 --> 01:21:55.232
It's just me and you in here.

930
01:21:56.567 --> 01:21:59.303
You tell me your story
and I'll listen.


931
01:22:00.604 --> 01:22:04.408
Sure you're ready?
It's a hell of a ride.


932
01:22:05.077 --> 01:22:07.244
That is one hell of a story.

933
01:22:10.082 --> 01:22:15.619
- I believe you.
- You do. I do, Garrett.


934
01:22:16.922 --> 01:22:18.656
I got a telegram.

935
01:22:19.557 --> 01:22:24.029
Sky man, like you, showed up
in Las Cruces, New Mexico


936
01:22:24.162 --> 01:22:26.397
a couple of days ago
and killed a few men.


937
01:22:26.530 --> 01:22:29.467
According to this,
he's heading this way.


938
01:22:31.036 --> 01:22:32.636
Can't be him, can it?

939
01:22:32.770 --> 01:22:34.840
You mean that Pee-yak?

940
01:22:34.973 --> 01:22:36.674
- Piak.
- Piak.


941
01:22:37.008 --> 01:22:39.978
The alien conqueror
from your story?


942
01:22:40.912 --> 01:22:44.182
If your story's true,
and I assume it is,


943
01:22:44.749 --> 01:22:46.918
we better be ready for him.

944
01:22:47.052 --> 01:22:48.854
I agree.

945
01:24:19.277 --> 01:24:21.345
Whiskey.

946
01:25:02.821 --> 01:25:07.025
- You look good.
- So do you. I think.


947
01:25:07.491 --> 01:25:09.027
Didn't I just kill you?

948
01:25:10.028 --> 01:25:13.464
Gentlemen, my friend here
thinks I can be killed.


949
01:25:14.032 --> 01:25:16.533
A mistake he made
more than once.


950
01:25:18.970 --> 01:25:21.172
You will find this
information amusing.


951
01:25:22.640 --> 01:25:25.010
There was a glitch
in the system.


952
01:25:25.643 --> 01:25:27.946
A virus was unleashed
into your population,


953
01:25:28.079 --> 01:25:31.682
followed by a deadly pandemic,
and as you can imagine,


954
01:25:32.017 --> 01:25:35.887
the community of minds
wanted to preserve your life


955
01:25:36.021 --> 01:25:38.890
once again,
but gave you no warning.


956
01:25:39.757 --> 01:25:41.592
So here we are.

957
01:25:41.725 --> 01:25:45.864
Both of us stuck in
the past with no army,


958
01:25:45.997 --> 01:25:49.334
no purpose and no blue liquid.

959
01:25:49.466 --> 01:25:51.169
What a shame.

960
01:25:53.171 --> 01:25:55.941
Well, maybe my DNA
could be a cure.


961
01:25:56.341 --> 01:25:57.976
Too many maybes.

962
01:25:58.843 --> 01:26:00.544
Sheriff?

963
01:26:01.779 --> 01:26:03.848
You have exactly one minute

964
01:26:03.982 --> 01:26:07.085
to go outside
and release your prisoner to me.


965
01:26:07.218 --> 01:26:10.956
If you fail to comply,
I will have every gun


966
01:26:11.089 --> 01:26:14.993
for hire in this dust bowl
shoot anyone who opposes.


967
01:26:15.827 --> 01:26:18.196
That includes
women and children.


968
01:26:18.930 --> 01:26:21.132
Ask him, I'm good for that.

969
01:26:27.839 --> 01:26:29.240
Listen up, cowboys,

970
01:26:29.975 --> 01:26:34.045
I will pay $1,000 dollars
to whoever brings me Diablo.


971
01:26:34.179 --> 01:26:35.447
Dead or alive.

972
01:26:35.612 --> 01:26:38.682
- Who wants to play?
- I do! I do!


973
01:26:48.293 --> 01:26:52.130
Whatever happens,
he cannot capture me.


974
01:26:52.897 --> 01:26:54.966
Burn my body if necessary.

975
01:26:55.800 --> 01:26:59.904
- He wants your DNA?
- Correct.


976
01:27:00.504 --> 01:27:02.673
What the hell's DNA?

977
01:27:06.177 --> 01:27:07.979
Let him out.

978
01:27:19.958 --> 01:27:21.292
It's been a pleasure
to know you.


979
01:27:21.426 --> 01:27:22.994
Let's give them some hell.

980
01:28:43.875 --> 01:28:45.742
This is my army?

981
01:29:24.082 --> 01:29:25.850
You're not going to capture me.

982
01:29:26.518 --> 01:29:28.685
I've got something
better than the blue liquid


983
01:29:28.820 --> 01:29:30.687
if you want to stick around
a little longer.


984
01:29:36.060 --> 01:29:37.862
This is your ticket home.

985
01:29:40.265 --> 01:29:42.200
Reload,
I'll give you a chance.


986
01:29:55.246 --> 01:29:59.117
You know bullets can't kill...

987
01:30:05.190 --> 01:30:06.958
You want to go
back to the future


988
01:30:07.091 --> 01:30:11.162
and I'll risk everything
to kill you.


989
01:30:17.936 --> 01:30:20.238
You want my DNA, asshole?

990
01:32:21.634 --> 01:32:26.634
