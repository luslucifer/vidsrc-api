1
00:05:16.532 --> 00:05:19.611
If you didn't mean to
do it, why did you?

2
00:05:19.635 --> 00:05:22.940
I guess I wanted to
find out what the fun was.

3
00:05:22.964 --> 00:05:23.995
Fun?

4
00:05:24.019 --> 00:05:28.662
My mother says that men
are the only animals that kill for fun.


5
00:05:28.724 --> 00:05:32.764
Danny, will you wait for me outside?

6
00:05:32.788 --> 00:05:36.273
I want to have
a word with your mother.

7
00:05:37.171 --> 00:05:39.632
We won't be long.

8
00:05:46.261 --> 00:05:49.052
Why did you take
that boy out of school?

9
00:05:49.076 --> 00:05:51.261
His teacher was a fool.

10
00:05:51.285 --> 00:05:55.804
I taught him more in two months
than he learned at school in a full term.


11
00:05:55.828 --> 00:05:57.885
In the course of his studies

12
00:05:57.909 --> 00:06:01.277
what have you
taught him about respect for the law?


13
00:06:01.301 --> 00:06:05.501
As he grows up, he'll learn
that there are good laws and bad ones.


14
00:06:05.525 --> 00:06:08.318
- He'll respect the good ones.
- And disobey the bad ones?


15
00:06:08.342 --> 00:06:09.853
At least I hope he does.

16
00:06:09.877 --> 00:06:13.469
Based only on his personal judgment
as an individual human being?


17
00:06:13.493 --> 00:06:17.373
Now, you can't choose
between right and wrong by taking a census.


18
00:06:17.397 --> 00:06:20.093
You can choose
by respecting the whole body of the laws


19
00:06:20.117 --> 00:06:23.221
as man's best hope for justice.

20
00:06:30.006 --> 00:06:33.918
Why does a young woman
like you live way out there alone


21
00:06:33.942 --> 00:06:36.446
in a shack on a deserted beach?

22
00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:40.158
I don't live alone. 
I live with my son

23
00:06:40.182 --> 00:06:42.494
and I live there because I love it.

24
00:06:42.518 --> 00:06:46.014
I love every day
I spend out there and every night.


25
00:06:46.038 --> 00:06:51.200
I love the sea and the mountains and
the sky and the birds and I love all of it.


26
00:06:51.224 --> 00:06:53.952
Then I take it,
you feel you have escaped

27
00:06:53.976 --> 00:06:57.824
from the corruption
and conformity of the modern world


28
00:06:57.848 --> 00:07:00.415
and that your life is serene

29
00:07:00.439 --> 00:07:05.431
because, like Thoreau
you live in direct communion with nature.


30
00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:08.928
But Thoreau didn't go to Walden Pond

31
00:07:08.952 --> 00:07:11.608
with a 9-year-old boy.

32
00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:15.617
What are you
trying to raise? A "noble savage"?


33
00:07:15.641 --> 00:07:17.729
What would you have me raise?

34
00:07:17.753 --> 00:07:20.673
A slick little
specialist in weather-cocksman-ship?


35
00:07:20.697 --> 00:07:21.792
I beg your pardon?

36
00:07:21.816 --> 00:07:24.320
Oh you know:
whirling around like a weathercock


37
00:07:24.344 --> 00:07:26.401
every time the wind changes.

38
00:07:26.425 --> 00:07:28.984
Oh yes, of course.

39
00:07:29.113 --> 00:07:31.126
I see.

40
00:07:31.321 --> 00:07:34.177
Let me see. Is this the third time

41
00:07:34.201 --> 00:07:36.609
that you and Danny have been
brought up before me or the fourth?


42
00:07:36.633 --> 00:07:38.818
- The third.
- And the first was...


43
00:07:38.842 --> 00:07:40.994
The little girl.

44
00:07:41.018 --> 00:07:43.608
Oh yes, of course.

45
00:07:43.962 --> 00:07:45.697
She was swinging.

46
00:07:45.721 --> 00:07:49.858
Her skirt blew back
and Danny put his hand on her thigh.


47
00:07:49.882 --> 00:07:52.930
- Well?
- Oh the child was frightened.


48
00:07:52.954 --> 00:07:56.291
Oh come on! She was delighted.

49
00:07:56.315 --> 00:07:59.458
And it was her
dirty-minded mother that made the trouble.


50
00:07:59.482 --> 00:08:01.634
And then there were the two horses

51
00:08:01.658 --> 00:08:04.771
that Danny turned loose, and finally the deer.

52
00:08:04.795 --> 00:08:08.248
Well that makes three strikes and out.

53
00:08:08.571 --> 00:08:11.874
You've heard of San Simeon School haven't you?

54
00:08:11.898 --> 00:08:14.146
- That religious school?
- Episcopalian.


55
00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:16.101
The headmaster is a friend of mine.

56
00:08:16.125 --> 00:08:18.564
I'm going to ask
him to enroll your son.

57
00:08:18.588 --> 00:08:22.303
Oh no, you don't!
He is my son. I'll be damned if...


58
00:08:22.364 --> 00:08:24.132
It's either that or reform school.

59
00:08:24.156 --> 00:08:28.165
Now force my hand
and I'll take him away from you altogether.


60
00:08:28.189 --> 00:08:32.100
I'm going to make an appointment
for you with the Reverend Dr. Hewitt


61
00:08:32.124 --> 00:08:35.260
and I suggest that you keep it.

62
00:08:45.404 --> 00:08:47.013
It's Cos and Larry. Hi

63
00:08:47.037 --> 00:08:49.476
Sweetie, what are you doing way out here?

64
00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:51.462
We called
by your home and there was nobody there.


65
00:08:51.486 --> 00:08:53.957
- And now you see why.
- Where are you going?


66
00:08:53.981 --> 00:08:56.933
Oh San Simeon.
Is that too far out of your way?


67
00:08:56.957 --> 00:08:58.982
Out by about 10 miles.

68
00:08:59.006 --> 00:09:03.288
San Simeon?
Two nice people like you? What's the word?


69
00:09:18.941 --> 00:09:20.550
Our English tongue has a long history

70
00:09:20.574 --> 00:09:25.030
and I am pleased with your interest
in its oldest and most ardent words.


71
00:09:25.054 --> 00:09:28.071
I think it's sad,
however, that these ancient expressions


72
00:09:28.095 --> 00:09:31.047
should be
degraded to a position on lavatory walls.


73
00:09:31.071 --> 00:09:32.743
You will scrub the walls down, of course.

74
00:09:32.767 --> 00:09:37.606
Then you will learn the equivalent
words in German, French and Latin


75
00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:41.703
after which you will decline each noun
and conjugate each verb in all tenses


76
00:09:41.727 --> 00:09:43.144
including the subjunctive.

77
00:09:43.168 --> 00:09:47.363
Thank you for your attention and good day.

78
00:09:54.433 --> 00:09:57.481
- Edward, do you have a minute?
- Of course.


79
00:09:57.505 --> 00:10:01.128
I just had another call from Ward Hendricks

80
00:10:01.152 --> 00:10:04.330
and he said, since it was you
who put him in charge of the Building Fund


81
00:10:04.354 --> 00:10:08.266
the least you can do is make up
your mind about flunking the Rogers boy.


82
00:10:08.290 --> 00:10:10.153
Chapel in 15 minutes, sir.

83
00:10:10.177 --> 00:10:11.816
Thank you, Tommy.

84
00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:14.696
What's this got to do with Ward Hendricks?

85
00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:19.370
Jack Rogers is willing
to make a substantial donation to the fund


86
00:10:19.394 --> 00:10:22.154
if his boy
stays in school, so quite naturally


87
00:10:22.178 --> 00:10:24.900
Ward wants your answer.

88
00:10:24.961 --> 00:10:27.659
What would you do in my shoes?

89
00:10:27.683 --> 00:10:29.451
Wear them.

90
00:10:29.475 --> 00:10:30.955
Very well.

91
00:10:30.979 --> 00:10:34.091
If Jack Rogers' contribution

92
00:10:34.115 --> 00:10:36.394
falls within the range of $2,000

93
00:10:36.418 --> 00:10:39.915
that quality of mercy
which runs through my blood like a fever


94
00:10:39.939 --> 00:10:41.419
whenever money is mentioned

95
00:10:41.443 --> 00:10:45.002
will be strained yet once more
to give the Rogers boy another chance


96
00:10:45.026 --> 00:10:47.967
his third, I believe.

97
00:10:48.737 --> 00:10:50.091
Dr. Hewitt

98
00:10:50.115 --> 00:10:53.227
the boy Judge Thompson sent you
is here with his mother.


99
00:10:53.251 --> 00:10:54.474
Thompson?

100
00:10:54.498 --> 00:10:57.867
Oh yes, yes. Send the mother in first.

101
00:10:57.891 --> 00:11:01.541
- Her name is Reynolds.
- Reynolds. Thank you.


102
00:11:16.549 --> 00:11:20.199
You're Mrs. Reynolds. I'm Dr. Hewitt.

103
00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:23.328
Please sit down: over there.

104
00:11:25.285 --> 00:11:28.525
I am told you've brought
a young man for us.

105
00:11:28.549 --> 00:11:31.424
I was ordered to bring him.

106
00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:34.733
Yes. Well I hope we'll
be able to help him.

107
00:11:34.757 --> 00:11:38.829
I want to make it quite clear
that in my opinion he doesn't need any help.


108
00:11:38.853 --> 00:11:41.902
Yes, I see.
Judge Thompson has briefed me, of course


109
00:11:41.926 --> 00:11:45.358
but I'd like
a little more general background.


110
00:11:45.382 --> 00:11:49.167
For example
what is the chief source of your income?


111
00:11:49.191 --> 00:11:50.639
I'm an artist.

112
00:11:50.663 --> 00:11:53.679
I paint. Nobody buys.

113
00:11:53.703 --> 00:11:57.231
Then I turn out
water colors when I need grocery money.


114
00:11:57.255 --> 00:12:00.270
May I ask,
what are your religious affiliations?


115
00:12:00.294 --> 00:12:04.048
- Of course. I am a naturalist.
- What?


116
00:12:04.072 --> 00:12:07.689
We believe that man
is doomed by his myths

117
00:12:07.912 --> 00:12:11.312
that there can be
no peace on earth until man rids himself


118
00:12:11.336 --> 00:12:13.646
of all belief in the supernatural.

119
00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:16.368
I see. Yes, very interesting. Go on.

120
00:12:16.392 --> 00:12:18.161
That's about it.

121
00:12:18.185 --> 00:12:19.824
It's a very small sect.

122
00:12:19.848 --> 00:12:22.416
With a membership of approximately one?

123
00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:24.079
Exactly one.

124
00:12:24.103 --> 00:12:27.525
With Danny as an officiate, of course

125
00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:31.313
but I have no objection
to your lack of religion or to your son's.


126
00:12:31.337 --> 00:12:34.384
But you do have compulsory
religious training here, don't you?


127
00:12:34.408 --> 00:12:38.480
Well chapel is compulsory, yes
but I have never yet forced a boy to pray.


128
00:12:38.504 --> 00:12:40.913
It can't be done, you know?

129
00:12:40.937 --> 00:12:43.346
It could be tried.

130
00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:47.091
San Simeon is not a jail, Mrs. Reynolds.

131
00:12:47.115 --> 00:12:51.761
Students don't come here
to be punished. They come here to be educated.


132
00:12:51.786 --> 00:12:54.386
Now we don't
have many boys from broken homes, but...


133
00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:56.530
My son is not from a broken home.

134
00:12:56.554 --> 00:13:01.317
Oh. Forgive me. I was under
the impression that you've been divorced.


135
00:13:01.386 --> 00:13:04.142
I've never been married.

136
00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:06.324
Oh I see.

137
00:13:06.348 --> 00:13:10.148
That puts
an entirely different light on the matter.


138
00:13:10.443 --> 00:13:12.019
Abandonment by the father...

139
00:13:12.043 --> 00:13:16.043
I was not
abandoned by the father, Dr. Hewitt.


140
00:13:16.076 --> 00:13:19.178
The father was abandoned by me.

141
00:13:21.483 --> 00:13:25.364
Are you trying to shock me

142
00:13:25.388 --> 00:13:27.187
Miss Reynolds?

143
00:13:27.211 --> 00:13:30.803
You may call me Mrs. 
Reynolds if you like.

144
00:13:30.827 --> 00:13:32.980
...because if you are, it's not easily done.

145
00:13:33.004 --> 00:13:34.995
You asked the questions.

146
00:13:35.019 --> 00:13:37.875
You're a minister.
You wouldn't want me to lie to you, would you?


147
00:13:37.899 --> 00:13:42.229
Neither would I want you to lie to me
if I were a truck driver or a disk jockey.


148
00:13:42.253 --> 00:13:46.054
I questioned you
because it's my job to do so.


149
00:13:47.052 --> 00:13:48.788
You send us a deeply disturbed boy...

150
00:13:48.812 --> 00:13:52.597
My son is not
deeply disturbed. He is not disturbed at all.


151
00:13:52.621 --> 00:13:56.372
He's a healthy, normal boy
because he hasn't been brainwashed yet!


152
00:13:56.396 --> 00:14:00.013
and I aim to see
that he stays that way.

153
00:14:07.053 --> 00:14:09.108
What happened?

154
00:14:09.132 --> 00:14:12.008
I am not exactly sure.

155
00:14:12.046 --> 00:14:15.368
She didn't seem to have any doubts.

156
00:14:15.917 --> 00:14:20.431
Apparently she thought
I was behaving like a pompous idiot.


157
00:14:20.815 --> 00:14:22.924
Were you?

158
00:14:24.014 --> 00:14:26.125
Probably.

159
00:14:35.024 --> 00:14:37.688
Look out for
those rocks. Be careful, they're loose.


160
00:14:37.712 --> 00:14:41.496
Joe, cross over and cut him off.
If he gets to the top, we'll never catch him.


161
00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:46.872
Danny, they're
trying to head you off. Run, Danny. Run.


162
00:14:46.896 --> 00:14:48.632
Oh God!

163
00:14:48.656 --> 00:14:52.696
Lady, he's
not going to jail. He's just going to school.


164
00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:54.648
School!

165
00:14:54.672 --> 00:14:57.689
Just 10 more
minutes and we would have been gone.


166
00:14:57.713 --> 00:15:01.400
It's an outrage, dragging a 9-year-old child
into San Simeon under armed guard.


167
00:15:01.424 --> 00:15:02.968
<i>Well how else can you take him?</i>

168
00:15:02.992 --> 00:15:04.280
What, do you think one runaway boy

169
00:15:04.304 --> 00:15:06.649
justifies setting up
a police state in Monterey County?


170
00:15:06.673 --> 00:15:09.369
<i>Yeah. That's about the
way it shapes up, Ed.</i>

171
00:15:09.393 --> 00:15:12.696
<i>If you'd treated the mother a little
more tactfully, it might not have happened.</i>


172
00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:15.672
<i>Now that it has,
I'm darn well going to see it through.</i>


173
00:15:15.696 --> 00:15:17.241
<i>Do you accept the boy or don't you?</i>

174
00:15:17.265 --> 00:15:18.841
Of course I accept him

175
00:15:18.865 --> 00:15:21.306
but after what's happened
it's going to be difficult to prove to him


176
00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:23.481
that we're not running
an extermination camp out here.


177
00:15:23.505 --> 00:15:25.880
<i>I've never been too sure myself.</i>

178
00:15:25.904 --> 00:15:29.675
<i>I've got somebody
on the other wire. Goodbye, Ed.</i>


179
00:15:29.778 --> 00:15:31.514
One of your room
mates is younger than you.

180
00:15:31.538 --> 00:15:33.433
The other two are a little bit older.

181
00:15:33.457 --> 00:15:35.609
Don't their folks like them?

182
00:15:35.633 --> 00:15:37.241
What do you mean?

183
00:15:37.265 --> 00:15:39.770
Sending them away like this.

184
00:15:39.794 --> 00:15:43.612
Well of course they like them. 
They love them.

185
00:15:43.636 --> 00:15:46.043
My mother wouldn't send me away.

186
00:15:46.067 --> 00:15:48.827
She likes me to be with her.

187
00:15:48.851 --> 00:15:52.173
So do all the parents, Danny, but...

188
00:15:54.164 --> 00:15:56.413
Tell me about your mother.

189
00:15:56.437 --> 00:16:00.092
How do you
spend your time? What do you do together?


190
00:16:00.116 --> 00:16:03.452
Oh we fish and she paints

191
00:16:03.476 --> 00:16:05.822
and I hunt and get the firewood.

192
00:16:05.846 --> 00:16:09.341
We swim and we play music

193
00:16:09.365 --> 00:16:11.230
and she teaches my lessons

194
00:16:11.254 --> 00:16:13.117
and we read poetry
to each other to memorize it.


195
00:16:13.141 --> 00:16:14.749
What sort of poetry?

196
00:16:14.773 --> 00:16:19.449
The last was <i>Canterbury Tales</i>,
only, we didn't get to finish it.


197
00:16:19.733 --> 00:16:23.038
You were memorizing <i>The Canterbury Tales?</i>

198
00:16:23.062 --> 00:16:25.565
Yeah, by Chaucer, you know.

199
00:16:25.589 --> 00:16:27.709
A long time ago.

200
00:16:27.733 --> 00:16:31.422
<i>Whan that Aprill, with his shoures soote</i>

201
00:16:31.446 --> 00:16:35.583
<i>The droghte of March
hath perced to the roote</i>


202
00:16:35.607 --> 00:16:39.806
<i>And bathed every veyne in swich licour</i>

203
00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:44.692
<i>Of which vertu engendred is the flour</i>

204
00:16:45.014 --> 00:16:47.125
You know?

205
00:16:49.461 --> 00:16:51.923
Which is my bed?

206
00:16:54.231 --> 00:16:56.506
Oh this one

207
00:16:56.695 --> 00:16:58.815
and this is your desk

208
00:16:58.839 --> 00:17:01.215
and this is where your clothes go.

209
00:17:01.239 --> 00:17:02.527
I didn't bring any clothes.

210
00:17:02.551 --> 00:17:05.687
Oh well, we'll pick them up for you.

211
00:17:06.134 --> 00:17:10.680
This is your
study kit and this is how it opens.


212
00:17:11.543 --> 00:17:13.536
You work with that for a while

213
00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:17.281
and I'll go and get your bedding.
The bathroom's right behind you.


214
00:17:17.305 --> 00:17:20.113
I'll be back in a minute.

215
00:17:20.441 --> 00:17:22.145
The background is still quite unclear to me

216
00:17:22.169 --> 00:17:24.001
but what I know of
it thus far isn't good.

217
00:17:24.025 --> 00:17:27.859
I advise you
to keep him on a very tight leash.


218
00:17:31.418 --> 00:17:33.857
I saw you through
the window and decided not to interrupt.


219
00:17:33.881 --> 00:17:37.953
It's just as well. He was reciting
the Prologue to Chaucer's <i>Canterbury Tales</i>


220
00:17:37.977 --> 00:17:39.490
in Old English.

221
00:17:39.514 --> 00:17:42.179
- You're not serious.
- I'm completely so. So was he.


222
00:17:42.203 --> 00:17:44.130
So apparently
was his mother when she taught him.


223
00:17:44.154 --> 00:17:46.178
It sounded perfect.

224
00:17:46.202 --> 00:17:47.650
Now you see the problem.

225
00:17:47.674 --> 00:17:51.061
Oh it's rather pleasantly different.

226
00:17:51.098 --> 00:17:54.370
- It will be like taming a bird.
- Two birds, really.


227
00:17:54.394 --> 00:17:55.555
Why two?

228
00:17:55.579 --> 00:17:58.562
The mother will need as
much help as the boy.

229
00:17:58.586 --> 00:18:01.379
Oh and another thing.
We'll have to pick up his clothes.


230
00:18:01.403 --> 00:18:03.842
Oh yes.
Could you arrange to pick up his things?


231
00:18:03.866 --> 00:18:05.379
Why don't you do it yourself?

232
00:18:05.403 --> 00:18:08.739
It's a good opportunity
to see where the boy has been raised.


233
00:18:08.763 --> 00:18:13.175
A good opportunity to take
more abuse from the mother, if you ask me.


234
00:18:48.382 --> 00:18:50.711
Anybody there?

235
00:19:25.503 --> 00:19:28.263
Sorry. I knocked.

236
00:19:28.287 --> 00:19:32.155
The door was open. 
I decided to wait.

237
00:19:35.264 --> 00:19:37.608
It's a baby sandpiper.

238
00:19:37.632 --> 00:19:40.539
I think his wing is broken.

239
00:19:41.216 --> 00:19:43.048
Would you light that lamp for me, please?

240
00:19:43.072 --> 00:19:46.274
- There's some matches right there.
- Sure.


241
00:19:48.865 --> 00:19:52.034
I have to try and make a splint.

242
00:20:13.634 --> 00:20:18.147
- What are you doing that for?
- This is supposed to hypnotize him.


243
00:20:33.155 --> 00:20:35.363
The break's here.

244
00:20:45.828 --> 00:20:49.794
- Is it strong enough?
- It should be. I hope so.


245
00:20:49.892 --> 00:20:53.541
Would you
tear off about an inch and a half of this?


246
00:21:00.421 --> 00:21:02.531
A baby.

247
00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:05.931
Now would you put that

248
00:21:05.955 --> 00:21:08.172
right over this part of the wing? gently

249
00:21:08.196 --> 00:21:11.038
Wait a minute. There.

250
00:21:11.461 --> 00:21:13.900
You will need a cage until it heals.

251
00:21:13.924 --> 00:21:17.069
- That would spoil everything.
- It's wild.


252
00:21:17.093 --> 00:21:19.565
That's why he shouldn't have a cage.

253
00:21:19.589 --> 00:21:22.830
The only way
you can tame a bird is to let him fly free


254
00:21:22.854 --> 00:21:25.133
if he can fly, of course.

255
00:21:25.157 --> 00:21:28.643
It's the only way you can tame anything.

256
00:21:28.645 --> 00:21:31.433
There, little sandpiper.

257
00:21:52.135 --> 00:21:54.191
You don't have on your collar.

258
00:21:54.215 --> 00:21:55.600
Well I don't wear it always, you know.

259
00:21:55.624 --> 00:21:59.338
It's not even a requirement of my profession.

260
00:22:10.824 --> 00:22:12.688
Why did you come here?

261
00:22:12.712 --> 00:22:15.408
Well I wanted
you to know that Danny is in good hands.


262
00:22:15.432 --> 00:22:17.263
My wife has been
with him most of the afternoon.


263
00:22:17.287 --> 00:22:20.676
- She says he's a fine boy.
- Your wife?


264
00:22:21.127 --> 00:22:24.330
My God! He is my son, not hers.

265
00:22:25.417 --> 00:22:27.409
Look at this place.

266
00:22:27.433 --> 00:22:31.121
It's clean. It's dry. It's warm.

267
00:22:31.145 --> 00:22:32.849
We have food.

268
00:22:32.873 --> 00:22:35.985
We have music. 
We have books to read.

269
00:22:36.009 --> 00:22:38.609
We have paints.
We have clay to make things up.


270
00:22:38.633 --> 00:22:41.224
What's wrong with it?

271
00:22:41.353 --> 00:22:44.082
Who in this
whole damn world could be rotten enough


272
00:22:44.106 --> 00:22:48.882
to take a kid away
from his home and give him away to a school?


273
00:22:48.906 --> 00:22:52.626
It may be
hard for you to believe, Miss Reynolds


274
00:22:52.650 --> 00:22:54.769
but boys like children of their own age.

275
00:22:54.793 --> 00:22:57.778
They also like some order in their lives.

276
00:22:57.802 --> 00:23:01.009
Given just a
little time, Danny will adjust beautifully.


277
00:23:01.033 --> 00:23:03.026
Adjust to what?

278
00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:06.418
To himself, to other people, to society.

279
00:23:06.442 --> 00:23:08.083
That's just it.

280
00:23:08.107 --> 00:23:11.027
I don't want him to adjust to society.

281
00:23:11.051 --> 00:23:13.684
Well if you want
Danny to be a non-conformist

282
00:23:13.708 --> 00:23:15.699
San Simeon
is the best place that could happen to him.


283
00:23:15.723 --> 00:23:18.932
We'll give him a set of values there
that he can rebel against later.


284
00:23:18.956 --> 00:23:23.118
Otherwise, he may rebel against yours.

285
00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:25.588
Oh I see.

286
00:23:25.612 --> 00:23:29.044
You mean, you teach children evil

287
00:23:29.068 --> 00:23:33.653
so that they can rebel against it
when they grow and become good.


288
00:23:33.677 --> 00:23:36.373
I didn't mean that at
all and you know it.

289
00:23:36.397 --> 00:23:38.613
Meanwhile
the court has ordered us to take the boy


290
00:23:38.637 --> 00:23:42.471
and I beg you to
give the school a fair trial.

291
00:23:44.398 --> 00:23:48.265
I don't see what choice I have.

292
00:23:55.373 --> 00:23:58.574
His bag was already packed.

293
00:23:58.990 --> 00:24:02.607
We were going to
Nevada when the cops came.

294
00:24:05.229 --> 00:24:08.170
It's all I have left of him.

295
00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:12.879
You might as well take that too.

296
00:24:13.198 --> 00:24:15.926
We're not
going to devour him, Miss Reynolds.


297
00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:18.293
You've got quite the wrong idea.

298
00:24:18.317 --> 00:24:20.918
We're not the lions at San Simeon.

299
00:24:20.942 --> 00:24:24.209
We're the Christians.

300
00:24:34.222 --> 00:24:36.300
Goodbye.

301
00:24:55.762 --> 00:24:57.709
Well

302
00:24:57.842 --> 00:25:00.335
there you have it.

303
00:25:01.969 --> 00:25:05.520
I can't believe we made him that unhappy.

304
00:25:05.809 --> 00:25:07.513
Has it shown in
the rest of his work?

305
00:25:07.537 --> 00:25:11.513
He is falling behind in all the subjects
he likes best, particularly English.


306
00:25:11.537 --> 00:25:13.210
Have you tried taking away his privileges?

307
00:25:13.234 --> 00:25:15.802
- I don't think it would work.
- Then what will?


308
00:25:15.826 --> 00:25:17.530
I'd like to try an experiment.

309
00:25:17.554 --> 00:25:20.859
Let him sit in on other
English classes regardless of the age group


310
00:25:20.883 --> 00:25:22.427
and choose the one he'd like to join.

311
00:25:22.451 --> 00:25:24.667
No no no.
I don't agree with that theory at all.


312
00:25:24.691 --> 00:25:27.130
Besides,
I don't want to start making exceptions.


313
00:25:27.154 --> 00:25:28.730
The boy himself is an exception.

314
00:25:28.754 --> 00:25:31.226
Even so, I don't want to
start something that will make people think


315
00:25:31.250 --> 00:25:32.604
we're turning radical around here.

316
00:25:32.628 --> 00:25:34.971
Even if you would,
nobody would ever believe you.


317
00:25:34.995 --> 00:25:36.698
- Hello, Walter.
- Hello.


318
00:25:36.722 --> 00:25:40.186
Ward Hendricks called from San Francisco.
He's driving down this afternoon.


319
00:25:40.210 --> 00:25:42.907
He wants to know if you'll
fill out a golf foursome at Pebble Beach.


320
00:25:42.931 --> 00:25:46.428
Oh Jim Harold
and Phil Sutcliff will be there.


321
00:25:46.452 --> 00:25:48.300
Oh

322
00:25:48.372 --> 00:25:50.780
The money is in town.

323
00:25:50.804 --> 00:25:53.147
Good idea. Tell him I'll call him back.

324
00:25:53.171 --> 00:25:56.374
Tell them to bring their check books.

325
00:26:00.436 --> 00:26:02.396
- You mean it, Phil?
- Sure I mean it.


326
00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:06.171
You hit the green and it's

327
00:26:06.195 --> 00:26:09.715
If you flunk it, 
I don't lay out a dime.

328
00:26:10.519 --> 00:26:12.663
All right.

329
00:26:19.222 --> 00:26:22.143
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.

330
00:26:22.167 --> 00:26:25.587
Take not the name of
the Lord thy God in vain.

331
00:26:27.254 --> 00:26:30.969
Hey what are you
doing with three aces, kid?

332
00:26:33.047 --> 00:26:37.460
That Reynolds boy, is he bridle-broke yet?

333
00:26:37.752 --> 00:26:40.799
I think
we're getting the bit between his teeth.


334
00:26:40.823 --> 00:26:43.327
The colt's been too long with the mare.

335
00:26:43.351 --> 00:26:46.016
If you weren't a man
of the cloth I'd recommend you gentled her


336
00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:47.968
before you tackled him.

337
00:26:47.992 --> 00:26:50.746
Lady artists can be fun.

338
00:26:52.312 --> 00:26:55.231
Judge Thompson, I've finally
found one bottle of your favorite blend.


339
00:26:55.255 --> 00:26:57.847
Did he say "Reynolds"?

340
00:26:57.913 --> 00:27:00.722
Yeah. A new boy at school.

341
00:27:00.952 --> 00:27:04.755
Would the lady artist's
name be "Laura Reynolds"?


342
00:27:05.016 --> 00:27:08.129
- Do you know her?
- Yeah. Well sort of.


343
00:27:08.153 --> 00:27:09.665
Does she live around here?

344
00:27:09.689 --> 00:27:12.417
Yeah. She's got
a cabin on the coast in Big Sur.


345
00:27:12.441 --> 00:27:14.453
Really?

346
00:27:15.576 --> 00:27:17.589
Do you...

347
00:27:17.848 --> 00:27:20.342
Do you know her well?

348
00:27:20.377 --> 00:27:24.129
Well that's hard to say.
I don't think anybody knows her well.


349
00:27:24.153 --> 00:27:26.081
No, it's not a tale for your ears.

350
00:27:26.105 --> 00:27:28.481
Well if you're referring
to the boy, I know he's illegitimate.


351
00:27:28.505 --> 00:27:30.177
The mother told me so herself.

352
00:27:30.201 --> 00:27:33.218
Don't look at me
like that. I'm not the daddy.


353
00:27:33.242 --> 00:27:35.009
I wasn't trying to
pry into your private life

354
00:27:35.033 --> 00:27:37.345
but the boy poses
something of a problem at school.


355
00:27:37.369 --> 00:27:41.914
It would be helpful if I knew
something of the mother's background.


356
00:27:45.755 --> 00:27:51.194
- Well I take it, this would be confidential?
- Of course.


357
00:27:51.867 --> 00:27:55.636
- Charlie. One more time.
- Right, Mr. Ward.


358
00:27:56.636 --> 00:28:00.548
Well if she was
telling the truth, which she usually does


359
00:28:00.572 --> 00:28:03.043
it shapes up something like this.

360
00:28:03.067 --> 00:28:05.923
From a nice respectable Indianapolis family

361
00:28:05.947 --> 00:28:08.260
boy the same, only rich

362
00:28:08.284 --> 00:28:12.644
boy: 19, girl: 17, girl pregnant
and the boy wanted to marry her


363
00:28:12.668 --> 00:28:14.564
but she'd have no part of it.

364
00:28:14.588 --> 00:28:17.412
Her father arranged an abortion.
She'd have no part of that either.


365
00:28:17.436 --> 00:28:21.379
So she left home,
comes to California has the baby


366
00:28:21.403 --> 00:28:23.108
and is still there.

367
00:28:23.132 --> 00:28:26.204
- Thank you, Charlie.
- All right.


368
00:28:28.508 --> 00:28:32.027
Who's paying the boy's tuition?

369
00:28:32.092 --> 00:28:35.620
I'm asking
several of the trustees to share it


370
00:28:35.644 --> 00:28:37.887
you included.

371
00:28:39.164 --> 00:28:42.399
All right, all right. Fair enough.

372
00:28:42.428 --> 00:28:45.184
Listen. Sure you won't stick around
and change your mind, have dinner?


373
00:28:45.693 --> 00:28:48.503
No. Thanks all the same.

374
00:29:05.469 --> 00:29:07.710
Come on in.

375
00:29:17.663 --> 00:29:21.761
Oh I'm sorry.
I was looking for Miss Reynolds.


376
00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:26.140
She's over there.

377
00:29:31.168 --> 00:29:33.498
Miss Reynolds?

378
00:29:33.537 --> 00:29:36.297
Dr. Hewitt, meet Cos Erickson

379
00:29:36.321 --> 00:29:38.562
boy beatnik.

380
00:29:39.072 --> 00:29:41.401
How do you do?

381
00:29:42.368 --> 00:29:45.276
Glad to know you, Reverend.

382
00:29:46.465 --> 00:29:48.937
Why don't you sit down?

383
00:29:48.961 --> 00:29:52.446
Yes, well thank you.

384
00:29:53.953 --> 00:29:56.520
I was driving from Monterey

385
00:29:56.544 --> 00:29:59.176
and I spotted your mailbox.

386
00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:02.436
Laura, this way a little bit more.

387
00:30:04.641 --> 00:30:07.232
- Is that right?
- Yes


388
00:30:08.545 --> 00:30:10.634
What were you saying, Dr. Hewitt?

389
00:30:10.658 --> 00:30:14.216
He was saying he was
driving around in the dark of night


390
00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:16.554
and just happened to spot your mailbox.

391
00:30:16.578 --> 00:30:19.273
Yes and I thought I'd tell you

392
00:30:19.297 --> 00:30:22.409
that we have high hopes for Danny's progress.

393
00:30:22.433 --> 00:30:24.555
In what way, Dr. Hewitt?

394
00:30:24.579 --> 00:30:27.518
Well we were thinking of

395
00:30:28.226 --> 00:30:32.771
changing certain classes
for him in certain subjects.


396
00:30:33.026 --> 00:30:35.627
That's nice. What subjects?

397
00:30:35.651 --> 00:30:38.438
English and history.

398
00:30:39.492 --> 00:30:43.660
I should hope so.
He was very good in those subjects


399
00:30:43.684 --> 00:30:46.924
before you
took him away from me. I taught them to him.


400
00:30:46.948 --> 00:30:49.004
Yes, I know that.

401
00:30:49.028 --> 00:30:53.484
The sandpiper
appears to be doing rather well, I see.


402
00:30:53.508 --> 00:30:55.787
Yes. He'll be flying soon.

403
00:30:55.811 --> 00:30:59.053
Cos, can we quit work now?

404
00:30:59.077 --> 00:31:01.259
I'd like to get some clothes on.

405
00:31:01.283 --> 00:31:03.745
All right, sure.

406
00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:06.668
It's all right, since I'm not paying you.

407
00:31:06.692 --> 00:31:08.737
Thanks.

408
00:31:10.181 --> 00:31:14.605
- Reverend, are you interested in art?
- "Reverend" is not a title.


409
00:31:14.629 --> 00:31:18.573
It's an adjective that qualifies a title.

410
00:31:18.597 --> 00:31:23.208
You may more properly
address me as "doctor" or "mister".


411
00:31:24.934 --> 00:31:28.527
- Excuse me.
- No, not at all. It's a common error.


412
00:31:28.551 --> 00:31:31.182
As for your question:
Yes, I am interested in art.


413
00:31:31.206 --> 00:31:33.743
Yeah, probably the same way
I am interested in religion.


414
00:31:33.767 --> 00:31:35.943
I doubt that.

415
00:31:36.967 --> 00:31:39.055
You know, Reverend

416
00:31:39.079 --> 00:31:42.671
I've always had a yen
to ask some qualified person a few questions


417
00:31:42.695 --> 00:31:44.015
about the Virgin birth.

418
00:31:44.039 --> 00:31:46.000
Having so powerful a thirst for knowledge

419
00:31:46.024 --> 00:31:48.528
you should have
asked those questions years ago. Fire away.


420
00:31:48.552 --> 00:31:49.615
Well you see

421
00:31:49.639 --> 00:31:54.383
I've had a theory
that no well-educated priest or minister


422
00:31:54.407 --> 00:31:57.904
could possibly believe
the greater part of our Christian dogma


423
00:31:57.928 --> 00:31:59.440
in this year of our...

424
00:31:59.464 --> 00:32:02.255
Cos, stop picking on Dr. Hewitt.

425
00:32:02.279 --> 00:32:04.390
"Picking on..."

426
00:32:04.487 --> 00:32:07.395
He damn near picked on me!

427
00:32:08.617 --> 00:32:11.058
Cos has to be leaving.

428
00:32:11.082 --> 00:32:14.129
You can stay
for a few minutes can't you, Dr. Hewitt?


429
00:32:14.153 --> 00:32:16.515
Yes, of course.

430
00:32:17.608 --> 00:32:20.451
I'll walk you to the path.

431
00:32:23.338 --> 00:32:26.770
Well good night, Reverend.

432
00:32:26.794 --> 00:32:29.516
Good night, son.

433
00:32:37.771 --> 00:32:40.337
Hey you were very rude.

434
00:32:40.361 --> 00:32:43.057
You sounded like some little village atheist.

435
00:32:43.081 --> 00:32:45.030
Yeah?

436
00:32:45.033 --> 00:32:48.617
Well that's what I am. 
A village atheist.

437
00:32:50.602 --> 00:32:53.194
Are you going to seduce him?

438
00:32:58.092 --> 00:33:00.934
Maybe. I don't know.

439
00:33:01.163 --> 00:33:04.365
It would serve him right if I did.

440
00:33:07.211 --> 00:33:10.413
No, Cos, I won't seduce him.

441
00:33:12.332 --> 00:33:13.876
Are you sure?

442
00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:15.124
Positive.

443
00:33:15.148 --> 00:33:19.188
I wouldn't give him
the satisfaction of blaming me afterwards


444
00:33:19.212 --> 00:33:21.738
or you either.

445
00:33:21.836 --> 00:33:23.796
Good night.

446
00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:25.832
'Night.

447
00:33:43.853 --> 00:33:45.525
Well?

448
00:33:45.549 --> 00:33:48.588
They're... They're reverent.

449
00:33:48.781 --> 00:33:51.242
Oh you're joking.

450
00:33:52.302 --> 00:33:55.143
Does the word offend you?

451
00:33:55.630 --> 00:34:00.841
They have the kind of reverence
without which religion would mean nothing.


452
00:34:01.231 --> 00:34:03.657
I wouldn't know.

453
00:34:04.782 --> 00:34:07.505
Can I get you some tea?

454
00:34:07.663 --> 00:34:11.319
- Would you like some grappa?
- Grappa, if you please.


455
00:34:11.343 --> 00:34:13.323
OK

456
00:34:16.046 --> 00:34:20.151
I talked
with a friend of yours this afternoon


457
00:34:20.175 --> 00:34:22.733
Mr. Ward Hendricks.

458
00:34:26.190 --> 00:34:29.393
He isn't exactly a friend anymore.

459
00:34:29.744 --> 00:34:33.708
He gave me
the impression he knew you rather well.


460
00:34:34.416 --> 00:34:37.421
In the biblical sense, he did.

461
00:34:37.648 --> 00:34:41.843
That is, he had carnal knowledge of me.

462
00:34:44.912 --> 00:34:47.984
Does that answer your question?

463
00:34:48.047 --> 00:34:50.737
I didn't ask one.

464
00:34:51.087 --> 00:34:53.784
I met him in San Francisco.

465
00:34:53.808 --> 00:34:57.097
Danny was just a baby. I was broke.

466
00:34:57.488 --> 00:35:02.104
He set me up in an apartment.
He put me through two years of art school.


467
00:35:02.128 --> 00:35:06.444
When I was finished
with school, I was finished with him.


468
00:35:08.082 --> 00:35:11.289
Did you know such things
went on in the world?

469
00:35:11.313 --> 00:35:13.978
He told me something of your background.

470
00:35:14.002 --> 00:35:16.429
I'll bet he did.

471
00:35:16.722 --> 00:35:20.218
And where did
this cozy conversation take place?


472
00:35:20.242 --> 00:35:23.098
In a pool hall or a locker room?

473
00:35:23.122 --> 00:35:26.837
Why, in a locker room,
as a matter of fact.

474
00:35:27.795 --> 00:35:31.259
That's where the boys really
let down their hair and pride, isn't it?


475
00:35:31.283 --> 00:35:33.851
Yes, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have brought it up. I apologize.


476
00:35:33.875 --> 00:35:35.131
I didn't mean to...

477
00:35:35.155 --> 00:35:37.051
Pry into my sex life?

478
00:35:37.075 --> 00:35:38.715
Of course you did.

479
00:35:38.739 --> 00:35:40.858
You've been dying to pry into it.

480
00:35:40.882 --> 00:35:43.291
Now that you've
seen me modeling for Cos Erickson


481
00:35:43.315 --> 00:35:45.339
you are dying to know about him too.

482
00:35:45.363 --> 00:35:48.059
I am not so much
interested in the men in your life


483
00:35:48.083 --> 00:35:51.318
as your attitude towards marriage.

484
00:35:52.212 --> 00:35:53.756
OK

485
00:35:53.780 --> 00:35:56.828
Ask it and it
shall be answered unto you.

486
00:35:56.852 --> 00:35:59.773
Well I understand that
Danny's father was quite prepared to marry you?


487
00:35:59.797 --> 00:36:01.628
That's right

488
00:36:01.652 --> 00:36:03.452
but I didn't love him.

489
00:36:03.476 --> 00:36:06.876
- But you must have at one time.
- Oh that...


490
00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:10.492
I was only in love
with him or thought I was.

491
00:36:10.516 --> 00:36:15.311
There's a difference
between being in love and loving and liking.


492
00:36:15.957 --> 00:36:17.181
Besides

493
00:36:17.205 --> 00:36:19.707
I didn't want to
wake up 50 years old some morning


494
00:36:19.731 --> 00:36:23.453
and peer across the pillow
with his face peering back.


495
00:36:23.477 --> 00:36:26.930
- How did your parents react?
- Very well.


496
00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:30.165
They offered me an abortion

497
00:36:30.453 --> 00:36:33.788
and when I wouldn't do it
they said I could stay at home


498
00:36:33.812 --> 00:36:35.101
and have Danny there.

499
00:36:35.125 --> 00:36:36.640
Why didn't you?

500
00:36:36.664 --> 00:36:41.458
Look. They were
trying to be sweet but they were ashamed.


501
00:36:41.943 --> 00:36:46.520
By offering the abortion
they showed me how they really felt.


502
00:36:47.096 --> 00:36:51.540
A child can't just be accepted.
It has to really be wanted


503
00:36:51.704 --> 00:36:54.560
so I went away
and had Danny by myself.

504
00:36:54.584 --> 00:36:58.977
I still don't know much
about your attitude towards marriage.


505
00:36:59.001 --> 00:37:02.967
I'm withholding judgment
until I see a happy one.


506
00:37:03.801 --> 00:37:05.887
How is yours?

507
00:37:05.911 --> 00:37:07.681
Adequate, as they say?

508
00:37:07.705 --> 00:37:12.379
No, it's more than adequate. It's good.

509
00:37:13.753 --> 00:37:16.344
Well bully for you.

510
00:37:16.761 --> 00:37:19.089
Cover this up.

511
00:37:19.097 --> 00:37:21.665
Has your marriage, as my non-marriage

512
00:37:21.689 --> 00:37:24.962
been blessed with children?

513
00:37:24.986 --> 00:37:27.682
Yes, twin boys. 
They're both in prep school.

514
00:37:27.706 --> 00:37:29.602
Learning to adjust?

515
00:37:29.626 --> 00:37:33.493
...or were they adjusted before they left?

516
00:37:34.297 --> 00:37:36.866
I'd better go
before I start answering you in kind.


517
00:37:36.890 --> 00:37:37.986
I won't bother you any more.

518
00:37:38.010 --> 00:37:40.578
From now on, you'll get
written reports about Danny's progress.


519
00:37:40.602 --> 00:37:42.811
Dr. Hewitt

520
00:37:45.274 --> 00:37:47.898
don't be so pompous.

521
00:37:47.963 --> 00:37:51.545
- Do you allow visitors?
- Yes


522
00:37:52.475 --> 00:37:55.710
Next time I'll come and visit you.

523
00:37:57.242 --> 00:37:59.044
All right.

524
00:37:59.068 --> 00:38:01.146
- Good night.
- Good night.


525
00:38:05.853 --> 00:38:08.132
What I'm actually
looking for in this new chapel


526
00:38:08.156 --> 00:38:13.062
is a sense of modesty,
a sense of purity that has no relation to size.


527
00:38:13.086 --> 00:38:15.973
Do you know the Church
of Santa Maria della Pace in Rome?


528
00:38:15.997 --> 00:38:17.477
Yeah.

529
00:38:17.501 --> 00:38:19.653
- Well that illustrates what I'm after.
- I see.


530
00:38:19.677 --> 00:38:21.861
- Not in actual design, but in...
- Excuse me.


531
00:38:21.885 --> 00:38:23.964
Good morning.

532
00:38:24.798 --> 00:38:26.876
Good morning.

533
00:38:28.669 --> 00:38:31.511
It is very good to see you here.

534
00:38:32.542 --> 00:38:35.265
I want to show you something.

535
00:38:51.039 --> 00:38:53.223
This is the
fourth form American literature class.


536
00:38:53.247 --> 00:38:55.974
It corresponds to the eighth grade.

537
00:38:55.998 --> 00:38:58.470
We allowed him to
select the class he felt he could do best in


538
00:38:58.494 --> 00:39:00.391
and this is the result.

539
00:39:00.415 --> 00:39:03.355
We've been spotted.

540
00:39:03.871 --> 00:39:06.055
So, you see,
his first clash with the Christians


541
00:39:06.079 --> 00:39:07.751
isn't the calamity you expected.

542
00:39:07.775 --> 00:39:11.143
I can see. I'm very grateful.

543
00:39:11.167 --> 00:39:14.817
Incidentally, I was... Oh please.

544
00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:17.607
I was talking to our architect about you.

545
00:39:17.631 --> 00:39:20.360
That is to say,
I was talking about you and our new chapel.


546
00:39:20.384 --> 00:39:23.015
The one we're going to build.

547
00:39:23.039 --> 00:39:25.928
It calls for two
stained-glass windows and it occurred to me


548
00:39:25.952 --> 00:39:29.544
we might try for
something indigenous to this particular area.


549
00:39:29.568 --> 00:39:31.816
I mean, the mountains, the sea

550
00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:35.239
whatever it is
that makes this part of the world unique.


551
00:39:35.263 --> 00:39:37.929
That would seem
to call for a local artist and I was...


552
00:39:37.953 --> 00:39:40.642
I was thinking of you.

553
00:39:40.802 --> 00:39:43.017
Well but I am an atheist.

554
00:39:43.041 --> 00:39:47.498
How could I design something
that glorifies a creed I don't believe in?


555
00:39:47.522 --> 00:39:49.482
Do you think
Orozco believed in Christianity?


556
00:39:49.506 --> 00:39:51.690
Or Rivera, or Portinari, or Chagall?

557
00:39:51.714 --> 00:39:53.738
Some of their best
work is found in churches.

558
00:39:53.762 --> 00:39:56.266
It's not at all rare to find

559
00:39:56.290 --> 00:39:58.666
the religious vision more purely apprehended

560
00:39:58.690 --> 00:40:02.111
by the non-believer than by the saint.

561
00:40:02.562 --> 00:40:04.171
Why do you say that?

562
00:40:04.195 --> 00:40:06.218
Well saints tend to be myopic

563
00:40:06.242 --> 00:40:10.524
whereas the atheist is almost always innocent

564
00:40:10.530 --> 00:40:15.621
and innocence is what
we want in this chapel.

565
00:40:53.444 --> 00:40:55.980
Couldn't you sell some just for grocery money?

566
00:40:56.004 --> 00:40:58.988
Believe me, honey. 
You've got what it takes

567
00:40:59.012 --> 00:41:00.876
but you're not ready yet.

568
00:41:00.900 --> 00:41:04.557
- The price doesn't matter. It doesn't...
- I don't want cheap pictures.


569
00:41:04.581 --> 00:41:06.976
I want expensive ones

570
00:41:07.494 --> 00:41:09.902
to match the rent those burglars charge me.

571
00:41:09.926 --> 00:41:12.526
Ellie, you're
the biggest fraud in Monterey County.


572
00:41:12.550 --> 00:41:17.247
Phil Sutcliff told me how much
you paid for this place and it's a scandal.


573
00:41:20.294 --> 00:41:22.339
This one.

574
00:41:22.534 --> 00:41:24.580
I'll...

575
00:41:24.966 --> 00:41:28.399
Since you won't handle her work
I'll deal with the artist directly.


576
00:41:28.423 --> 00:41:30.190
How much?

577
00:41:30.214 --> 00:41:33.056
Cool, baby. Play it cool.

578
00:41:34.855 --> 00:41:37.479
- A hundred.
- And sold.


579
00:41:37.639 --> 00:41:40.399
Ellie, would you have this framed for me?

580
00:41:40.423 --> 00:41:41.519
Thank you.

581
00:41:41.543 --> 00:41:43.055
You're serious, aren't you?

582
00:41:43.079 --> 00:41:46.543
I was also serious
about the chapel windows. Were you?


583
00:41:46.567 --> 00:41:48.016
Sure she was.

584
00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:51.856
Look, baby.
With a parson and a preacher for a patron


585
00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:53.072
you've got it made.

586
00:41:53.096 --> 00:41:56.363
Just think of all those Renaissance cats.

587
00:41:56.743 --> 00:41:58.191
Well?

588
00:41:58.215 --> 00:42:01.232
Well yes. I've made some sketches.

589
00:42:01.256 --> 00:42:04.560
You know, just to
try and find an approach.

590
00:42:04.584 --> 00:42:08.943
- When can I see them?
- Well tonight on your way home.


591
00:42:08.967 --> 00:42:11.440
Maybe you could stop for dinner.

592
00:42:11.464 --> 00:42:13.617
- You're free, aren't you?
- No no no.


593
00:42:13.641 --> 00:42:16.465
- Tonight's my night for the drive-in.
- Can you?


594
00:42:16.489 --> 00:42:18.512
Well I'd like to, but I...

595
00:42:18.536 --> 00:42:21.457
I've got a lot of appointments.
I don't know when they'd be through.


596
00:42:21.481 --> 00:42:23.664
Well it's up to you.

597
00:42:23.688 --> 00:42:26.641
Any time after 8:00, if you can.

598
00:42:26.665 --> 00:42:29.637
Well I'll try. Thank you. Goodbye.

599
00:42:53.643 --> 00:42:58.088
- You don't like them.
- On the contrary, I like them very much:


600
00:42:58.603 --> 00:43:02.634
all the charm
and wonder of a child's vision of creation


601
00:43:04.076 --> 00:43:06.884
but there's one thing missing.

602
00:43:07.275 --> 00:43:09.779
- God?
- No, man.


603
00:43:09.803 --> 00:43:12.596
- I left him out.
- Why?


604
00:43:12.620 --> 00:43:14.260
Well I...

605
00:43:14.284 --> 00:43:19.821
I wanted the world
to be innocent and it can't be with man in it.


606
00:43:21.739 --> 00:43:25.542
You see,
this is the universe before man came along.


607
00:43:26.221 --> 00:43:29.972
It won't do. Man is
essential to any concept of the universe.


608
00:43:29.996 --> 00:43:33.395
Without him the universe
would be here but it wouldn't be conceived.


609
00:43:33.419 --> 00:43:34.964
That is the miracle of man

610
00:43:34.988 --> 00:43:39.605
that he can imagine
the awe and terror of an infinite universe


611
00:43:39.629 --> 00:43:41.525
and still not be frightened by it

612
00:43:41.549 --> 00:43:45.492
but facing the mystery of time
and the implacability of death


613
00:43:45.516 --> 00:43:49.734
he can still laugh, work, create

614
00:43:50.477 --> 00:43:53.232
and love.

615
00:43:53.709 --> 00:43:55.317
Well good for him.

616
00:43:55.341 --> 00:43:58.484
Then he'll have to
be in somebody else's sketches.


617
00:43:58.508 --> 00:44:00.373
Tell me.

618
00:44:00.397 --> 00:44:03.831
Do you isolate yourself here
to eliminate man from your life


619
00:44:03.855 --> 00:44:08.235
as thoroughly
as you've eliminated man from your sketches?


620
00:44:08.655 --> 00:44:11.245
That could be true.

621
00:44:12.430 --> 00:44:15.241
I suppose in a way it is.

622
00:44:15.951 --> 00:44:19.469
- Why?
- You know


623
00:44:20.879 --> 00:44:24.780
men have been staring at me

624
00:44:25.391 --> 00:44:29.456
and rubbing up
against me ever since I was 12 years old.


625
00:44:31.312 --> 00:44:34.700
They've always been, sort of

626
00:44:35.697 --> 00:44:40.889
waiting for me
to stumble, so that they can close in.


627
00:44:40.913 --> 00:44:45.391
Sometimes I get
the suffocating feeling that they will.


628
00:44:45.521 --> 00:44:47.598
And I...

629
00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:50.323
I see myself

630
00:44:51.024 --> 00:44:54.642
perhaps tomorrow, perhaps next year

631
00:44:55.569 --> 00:45:00.364
being handed from man to man

632
00:45:01.106 --> 00:45:04.462
as if I were an amusement

633
00:45:05.970 --> 00:45:08.625
for men who only

634
00:45:08.818 --> 00:45:13.232
have had me and never really loved me.

635
00:45:16.979 --> 00:45:20.954
So I came here,
and you don't believe a word I've said.


636
00:45:20.978 --> 00:45:23.950
On the contrary, I do.

637
00:45:23.954 --> 00:45:27.675
However, instead of
eliminating man from your life totally


638
00:45:27.699 --> 00:45:31.899
why don't you
solve the problem by finding a man


639
00:45:31.923 --> 00:45:34.204
a kind of man
who would really love you?

640
00:45:34.228 --> 00:45:35.676
I don't think it's possible

641
00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:39.645
for a man to really
love a woman like me.

642
00:45:39.669 --> 00:45:44.114
He only just has her, I think.

643
00:45:48.308 --> 00:45:51.613
How much is this
crazy chapel going to cost?

644
00:45:51.637 --> 00:45:54.812
About $100,000.

645
00:45:54.836 --> 00:45:56.509
For just a place to pray?

646
00:45:56.533 --> 00:45:59.933
Well a place
to pray is not as trivial as you think.


647
00:45:59.957 --> 00:46:02.516
But you can pray anywhere.

648
00:46:02.868 --> 00:46:05.245
If man is so important, why...

649
00:46:05.269 --> 00:46:08.373
why don't you spend the money on him?

650
00:46:09.077 --> 00:46:12.541
How many poor children could you educate for

651
00:46:12.565 --> 00:46:14.960
$100,000?

652
00:46:15.478 --> 00:46:17.807
Don't do that.

653
00:46:20.597 --> 00:46:25.295
Destroying your work
like that is like... It's a kind of suicide.


654
00:46:26.614 --> 00:46:31.158
No, it's a kind of discipline.

655
00:46:31.863 --> 00:46:36.210
I've always been too eager for recognition

656
00:46:36.502 --> 00:46:39.770
for praise... for the praise's sake alone.

657
00:46:41.335 --> 00:46:45.311
Why else would I have designed sketches

658
00:46:45.335 --> 00:46:49.399
for a building
I have no feeling for and I don't believe in?


659
00:46:50.456 --> 00:46:52.607
I wanted your praise.

660
00:46:52.631 --> 00:46:56.150
You think
I praised your work to make you like me?


661
00:46:57.175 --> 00:46:59.504
I suppose not

662
00:47:03.194 --> 00:47:07.356
but that's what you accomplished.

663
00:47:12.697 --> 00:47:16.706
- Does your wife know you're here?
- No


664
00:47:16.730 --> 00:47:18.531
Why didn't you tell her?

665
00:47:18.555 --> 00:47:22.618
I often make appointments
without having to call up my wife.


666
00:47:23.385 --> 00:47:25.333
Of course.

667
00:47:32.569 --> 00:47:34.681
Do you like it?

668
00:47:34.842 --> 00:47:38.147
Yes, I like it. 
I don't like him.

669
00:47:38.171 --> 00:47:41.754
- Cos is all right.
- If you say so.


670
00:47:49.499 --> 00:47:52.287
- I'd better be going.
- Why?


671
00:47:53.148 --> 00:47:57.015
I can talk while I work.

672
00:48:09.532 --> 00:48:13.913
I want you, Laura. I want you.

673
00:48:45.342 --> 00:48:47.420
Oh God

674
00:48:49.054 --> 00:48:53.751
Grant me some small remembrance of honor.

675
00:48:56.190 --> 00:48:58.617
Give me strength.

676
00:49:00.894 --> 00:49:03.072
Give me

677
00:49:04.639 --> 00:49:06.914
emptiness.

678
00:49:16.768 --> 00:49:18.845
Come in.

679
00:49:27.232 --> 00:49:29.576
Who told you I live here?

680
00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:32.507
Hey. Ed Hewitt.

681
00:49:32.512 --> 00:49:35.779
Oh yeah. The locker room session.

682
00:49:35.968 --> 00:49:38.633
You were swapping stories about me, right?

683
00:49:38.657 --> 00:49:43.169
Yes, well it seems as though
I swapped considerably more than I got.


684
00:49:44.096 --> 00:49:47.304
He never
even hinted you were seeing each other.


685
00:49:47.328 --> 00:49:51.081
- We're not.
- I dropped by to see you last night.


686
00:49:51.105 --> 00:49:52.904
Ed's car was parked up by the mailbox.

687
00:49:52.928 --> 00:49:54.953
So I drove on to Nepenthe instead.

688
00:49:54.977 --> 00:49:57.641
He dropped by
to report on Danny's schoolwork.


689
00:49:57.665 --> 00:49:59.433
It must have been
a hell of a report.

690
00:49:59.457 --> 00:50:03.741
I drove back about

691
00:50:05.762 --> 00:50:09.034
- What do you want, Ward?
- Well I want to help you.


692
00:50:09.058 --> 00:50:11.946
You're too level-headed
a girl to start kidding yourself now.


693
00:50:11.970 --> 00:50:15.180
Ed's married.
He's got a wife, two teenage boys...


694
00:50:15.204 --> 00:50:17.387
He's not going to
leave her for you or anybody else.


695
00:50:17.411 --> 00:50:20.331
There's no future
for you there, baby, no future at all.


696
00:50:20.355 --> 00:50:23.691
- As there was with you?
- Well you thought there was a future.


697
00:50:23.715 --> 00:50:26.475
You said you wanted to be
an artist, so I went with the art school bit


698
00:50:26.499 --> 00:50:28.108
just as long as you did.

699
00:50:28.132 --> 00:50:30.892
- You got what you wanted, didn't you?
- And you didn't?


700
00:50:30.916 --> 00:50:33.604
Well of course I did.

701
00:50:34.244 --> 00:50:36.191
Well.

702
00:50:37.955 --> 00:50:42.400
I apologize, Ward.
I sounded pretty phoney there for a minute.


703
00:50:43.044 --> 00:50:48.287
You did give me what I needed
and you never beat me or cheated me.


704
00:50:52.389 --> 00:50:55.341
Won't you sit down?
Would you like some coffee?


705
00:50:55.365 --> 00:50:57.988
No, not now. Not yet.

706
00:51:00.069 --> 00:51:03.214
- Selling lots of cars?
- Oh God, yes.


707
00:51:03.238 --> 00:51:05.185
I'm rich.

708
00:51:07.046 --> 00:51:11.045
I was never poor. Now I'm rich.

709
00:51:14.823 --> 00:51:17.519
- Who did this?
- A friend.


710
00:51:17.543 --> 00:51:19.490
Yeah?

711
00:51:20.614 --> 00:51:23.566
- How's your family?
- Peggy and I are divorced.


712
00:51:23.590 --> 00:51:25.537
We...

713
00:51:26.855 --> 00:51:29.647
We get our final in three months.

714
00:51:29.671 --> 00:51:31.472
What happened?

715
00:51:31.496 --> 00:51:35.886
Well if you see
a pair of nubbins, I earned them.


716
00:51:35.910 --> 00:51:40.079
You mean, this time it wasn't you?

717
00:51:40.103 --> 00:51:42.608
- It was...
- That's right. Peggy.


718
00:51:42.632 --> 00:51:44.913
I caught her cold too:

719
00:51:44.937 --> 00:51:46.949
another man.

720
00:51:48.199 --> 00:51:50.048
Caught?

721
00:51:50.664 --> 00:51:54.434
- You mean, detectives?
- Yeah, a little bit.


722
00:51:54.696 --> 00:51:57.506
I even got custody of the kids.

723
00:51:58.409 --> 00:52:01.512
Aside from that, 
I'm free as the wind.

724
00:52:01.640 --> 00:52:03.948
How does it feel?

725
00:52:06.058 --> 00:52:08.103
Lonely.

726
00:52:10.889 --> 00:52:14.954
You know, it's been
lonely ever since you left.

727
00:52:15.402 --> 00:52:18.225
Look, Laura baby. If there's
anything at all like the old spark between us


728
00:52:18.249 --> 00:52:20.274
I'd marry you this time. 
Honest I would.

729
00:52:20.298 --> 00:52:22.921
Don't be silly, Ward.

730
00:52:22.952 --> 00:52:25.926
I don't want to
go to bed with you.

731
00:52:26.409 --> 00:52:28.562
I certainly wouldn't marry you.

732
00:52:28.586 --> 00:52:31.859
You would play house
with me but you wouldn't get married?


733
00:52:31.883 --> 00:52:33.993
That's right.

734
00:52:35.882 --> 00:52:38.226
That's exactly right.

735
00:52:38.250 --> 00:52:39.859
Why not?

736
00:52:39.883 --> 00:52:42.674
Because you're a creep, Ward.

737
00:52:42.698 --> 00:52:45.874
I can't help it, but you're a creep.

738
00:52:45.898 --> 00:52:47.827
You're a terrible creep.

739
00:52:47.851 --> 00:52:49.874
Running around
with the reverend the way you are


740
00:52:49.898 --> 00:52:51.955
you are in
no position to throw stones at me.


741
00:52:51.979 --> 00:52:54.163
What do you mean?

742
00:52:54.187 --> 00:52:56.915
I mean that if
I wanted you right now

743
00:52:56.939 --> 00:53:01.669
there is nothing
that you could say or do about it.


744
00:53:04.236 --> 00:53:08.933
- All right. All right.
- You do it, and I'll kill you!


745
00:53:10.989 --> 00:53:13.449
Whatever you say, baby.

746
00:53:16.654 --> 00:53:19.861
Just remember, when
the chickens come home to roost, I'll...


747
00:53:19.885 --> 00:53:22.214
I'll be there, baby.

748
00:53:22.349 --> 00:53:25.157
Just give me a ring, huh?

749
00:54:02.222 --> 00:54:04.535
But I mailed them
two weeks ago. Why hasn't she signed them?


750
00:54:04.559 --> 00:54:07.062
<i>My fault, Fred. I've been
so busy out here that I kept postponing it.</i>


751
00:54:07.086 --> 00:54:08.951
Well don't postpone it any longer.

752
00:54:08.975 --> 00:54:10.967
My first order expired a week ago.

753
00:54:10.991 --> 00:54:14.198
Legally, that boy is in limbo.
That's a hell of a place for a 9-year-old.


754
00:54:14.222 --> 00:54:16.663
<i>Get those papers signed and goodbye.</i>

755
00:54:16.687 --> 00:54:18.765
Goodbye.

756
00:54:26.063 --> 00:54:29.815
<i>In a lesser sense,
the temptation of Jesus in the wilderness</i>


757
00:54:29.839 --> 00:54:33.839
<i>is the common experience of all mankind.</i>

758
00:54:37.168 --> 00:54:42.063
In the text itself
St. Matthew makes the matter very clear.


759
00:54:42.705 --> 00:54:44.217
Quote:

760
00:54:44.241 --> 00:54:49.036
<i>Then was Jesus
led up of the spirit into the wilderness</i>


761
00:54:49.201 --> 00:54:51.695
<i>to be tempted...</i>

762
00:55:05.170 --> 00:55:07.514
I deserve a medal.

763
00:55:07.538 --> 00:55:10.330
I spent two hours
straight with Mrs. LeMoyne Richards


764
00:55:10.354 --> 00:55:15.034
and all I got for
the building fund was $100.

765
00:55:15.058 --> 00:55:19.439
- That's good.
- What did Judge Thompson want?


766
00:55:19.539 --> 00:55:23.035
Oh he sent me some
legal papers he wants Miss Reynolds to sign.


767
00:55:23.059 --> 00:55:27.188
I have to drive
over there this evening. Care to come along?


768
00:55:28.563 --> 00:55:32.059
All I want after
Mrs. Richards is a hot bath and an early bed.


769
00:55:32.083 --> 00:55:35.547
Besides, I owe the boys a letter.

770
00:55:35.571 --> 00:55:37.648
So do I.

771
00:55:44.340 --> 00:55:46.523
- Don't you like it?
- Yes


772
00:55:46.547 --> 00:55:49.020
I'm glad
you could find a way to help her out.


773
00:55:49.044 --> 00:55:52.028
I bought it because I think it's good.

774
00:55:52.052 --> 00:55:54.992
You'd better come in to lunch now.

775
00:56:49.783 --> 00:56:52.063
I've been waiting half the night for this.

776
00:56:52.087 --> 00:56:55.475
All right. Just bring another bottle.

777
00:56:57.335 --> 00:56:58.496
Thanks.

778
00:56:58.520 --> 00:57:02.038
That ought to cheer
you up a little bit.

779
00:57:02.231 --> 00:57:04.441
I know.

780
00:57:05.784 --> 00:57:08.953
Here comes your preacher friend.

781
00:57:20.857 --> 00:57:24.480
- Hello.
- Could I speak to you for a moment?


782
00:57:24.504 --> 00:57:27.488
Everybody, this is Dr. Hewitt.

783
00:57:27.512 --> 00:57:31.364
Doctor, welcome
to the Club Nepenthe. Sit down. Join us.


784
00:57:31.388 --> 00:57:34.622
- Well I'm...
- Oh please sit down.


785
00:57:37.403 --> 00:57:40.997
You know, we were
just talking about the word "nepenthe."


786
00:57:41.021 --> 00:57:44.004
Howard here
says it means the same as "nirvana."


787
00:57:44.028 --> 00:57:48.823
But Cos says
it means
the banishment of all pain and sorrow.


788
00:57:48.892 --> 00:57:50.564
I don't really know. 
I'm not an authority

789
00:57:50.588 --> 00:57:54.948
but I think that
probably "oblivion" is a better translation.


790
00:57:54.972 --> 00:57:57.476
The Greeks, I think, thought of nepenthe

791
00:57:57.500 --> 00:58:01.028
as a state of mind induced by drugs

792
00:58:01.052 --> 00:58:03.236
probably hashish.

793
00:58:03.260 --> 00:58:05.861
Oh say there, Reverend

794
00:58:05.885 --> 00:58:07.622
I've got a friend

795
00:58:07.646 --> 00:58:12.069
and he claims he gets
a mystical kick from H.

796
00:58:12.093 --> 00:58:14.565
- H?
- Yeah, H.


797
00:58:14.589 --> 00:58:16.453
So, what do you say, Reverend?

798
00:58:16.477 --> 00:58:20.294
Do you think you can
find God at the end of a hypodermic needle?


799
00:58:20.318 --> 00:58:22.374
Cos, cut it out.

800
00:58:22.398 --> 00:58:26.118
Oh well,
I served in the Medical Corps during the war


801
00:58:26.142 --> 00:58:30.022
and I can't
tell you how many dying and wounded men


802
00:58:30.046 --> 00:58:32.677
found something of God's mercy

803
00:58:32.701 --> 00:58:36.166
at the end
of just such a needle as you described.


804
00:58:36.190 --> 00:58:39.229
Cos, you've just been dropped.

805
00:58:39.870 --> 00:58:43.175
I have some papers
that Judge Thompson wants you to sign.


806
00:58:43.199 --> 00:58:44.647
What kind of papers?

807
00:58:44.671 --> 00:58:46.598
They're related to Danny's custody.

808
00:58:46.622 --> 00:58:48.551
Hey what do you say about that, Reverend?

809
00:58:48.575 --> 00:58:50.727
Cut it out, Cos.

810
00:58:50.751 --> 00:58:54.311
They've got a point there.
But it's all right, OK, Reverend? I'm sorry.


811
00:58:54.335 --> 00:58:56.967
These papers about Danny.

812
00:58:56.991 --> 00:58:58.984
What are they supposed to be?

813
00:58:59.008 --> 00:59:00.776
Well I think
you'd better read them over first


814
00:59:00.800 --> 00:59:02.984
and anything
you don't understand, I'll try to explain.


815
00:59:03.008 --> 00:59:05.119
Reverend?

816
00:59:05.696 --> 00:59:08.936
You can't explain
anything here. Let's get out.


817
00:59:08.960 --> 00:59:10.536
Hey what's the matter? 
Wait a minute.

818
00:59:10.560 --> 00:59:12.392
Did I say something wrong? 
What's going on?

819
00:59:12.416 --> 00:59:15.421
What is going on is business:

820
00:59:16.128 --> 00:59:17.769
mine.

821
00:59:17.793 --> 00:59:21.641
Now wait a minute. I'd like
the Reverend to straighten us out on angels.


822
00:59:21.665 --> 00:59:22.857
- What?
- Come on, let's dance.


823
00:59:22.881 --> 00:59:24.425
Angels, you know.

824
00:59:24.449 --> 00:59:25.993
Cool it, this sounds interesting.

825
00:59:26.017 --> 00:59:27.209
OK?

826
00:59:27.233 --> 00:59:28.873
All right. Yeah.

827
00:59:28.897 --> 00:59:31.241
This is a problem of sex.

828
00:59:31.265 --> 00:59:36.257
Catherine says that angels
are neuter; you know, kind of, like mules.


829
00:59:36.544 --> 00:59:41.194
Overton says that she read
someplace that angels are just like people.


830
00:59:41.218 --> 00:59:46.026
You know, the boy angels and
the girl angels, and all that kind of thing.


831
00:59:46.050 --> 00:59:47.498
So?

832
00:59:47.522 --> 00:59:51.291
Well that's it,
man, you know. What's the answer?


833
00:59:51.393 --> 00:59:53.962
I think you'll
probably find the answer in Proverbs.


834
00:59:53.986 --> 00:59:57.472
It's Chapter 16, verse 22.

835
00:59:57.602 --> 01:00:00.842
<i>Understanding is a
wellspring of life unto him that hath it</i>


836
01:00:00.866 --> 01:00:03.490
<i>but the instruction</i>

837
01:00:04.226 --> 01:00:07.101
<i>of fools is folly.</i>

838
01:00:10.787 --> 01:00:14.273
Cos, you go stand in the corner.

839
01:00:20.163 --> 01:00:24.740
According to this, you're Danny's guardian.

840
01:00:25.571 --> 01:00:29.293
I can't take him
out of San Simeon no matter what happens?


841
01:00:29.317 --> 01:00:31.948
Not this term you can't.

842
01:00:31.972 --> 01:00:34.628
Then I won't sign it.

843
01:00:34.692 --> 01:00:39.683
It still has to be proved to me
that San Simeon is the best solution.


844
01:00:41.284 --> 01:00:42.861
I agree.

845
01:00:42.885 --> 01:00:47.560
However,
I'll talk to Judge Thompson about it.


846
01:00:53.382 --> 01:00:56.900
Then it wasn't really that urgent?

847
01:00:58.438 --> 01:01:02.600
You didn't need the signature tonight.

848
01:01:03.590 --> 01:01:06.181
It could have waited.

849
01:01:08.582 --> 01:01:11.206
It was urgent to me.

850
01:01:15.046 --> 01:01:18.467
I cannot dispel you from my thoughts.

851
01:02:55.083 --> 01:02:57.651
One minute, you were asleep.

852
01:02:57.675 --> 01:03:01.490
The next minute,
I woke up and you were gone.


853
01:03:01.514 --> 01:03:03.027
I didn't want to wake you.

854
01:03:03.051 --> 01:03:07.334
Oh how awful,
you have to get out of bed and drive home


855
01:03:08.108 --> 01:03:13.164
I mean,
in the fog and the dark all the time.


856
01:03:15.371 --> 01:03:17.962
Your tie is crooked.

857
01:03:27.469 --> 01:03:30.192
I can hear your heart.

858
01:03:30.605 --> 01:03:33.066
Do you hear mine?

859
01:03:36.430 --> 01:03:39.915
Am I as good for
you as you are for me?

860
01:03:44.462 --> 01:03:46.791
I must leave.

861
01:03:47.342 --> 01:03:50.806
- Forgive me, I must go.
- Why?


862
01:03:50.830 --> 01:03:54.999
Don't ask me
such a question. You know why. You must know.


863
01:03:55.023 --> 01:03:57.352
I don't know.

864
01:03:57.934 --> 01:04:02.967
You just did what you've been
wanting to do ever since you first saw me.


865
01:04:02.991 --> 01:04:04.439
If it's so bloody tragic

866
01:04:04.463 --> 01:04:07.982
why didn't you hurt then instead of now?

867
01:04:09.296 --> 01:04:11.160
I have no defense.

868
01:04:11.184 --> 01:04:14.223
- I have no sympathy.
- Sympathy?


869
01:04:14.224 --> 01:04:15.512
Yes, sympathy.

870
01:04:15.536 --> 01:04:18.680
I'm a minister of the Christian faith.

871
01:04:18.704 --> 01:04:23.064
If you feel that that's meant
anything to me, anything to me at all


872
01:04:23.088 --> 01:04:26.680
what would you
expect me to feel like at this minute?


873
01:04:26.704 --> 01:04:30.616
That depends
on how you expected to feel about me


874
01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:34.607
whether you wanted me
as a woman or just a whore.


875
01:04:34.865 --> 01:04:36.665
My God, I...

876
01:04:36.689 --> 01:04:40.792
...because if you wanted me
as a woman you would feel as I do now:


877
01:04:40.816 --> 01:04:43.066
at peace with myself

878
01:04:43.090 --> 01:04:47.568
clean and content

879
01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:51.308
without any sense of guilt.

880
01:04:53.137 --> 01:04:57.453
You're blameless
and without guilt. You're good.


881
01:04:59.379 --> 01:05:02.101
You're a glowing woman.

882
01:05:02.931 --> 01:05:04.667
I don't approve of many of your beliefs

883
01:05:04.691 --> 01:05:08.559
but at least
you are true to them and to yourself.


884
01:05:09.812 --> 01:05:14.640
I'm just a hypocrite.

885
01:05:17.459 --> 01:05:20.269
Please don't feel so bad.

886
01:05:20.628 --> 01:05:22.938
Don't go like this.

887
01:05:22.962 --> 01:05:27.260
Look, let me
make some coffee and we'll sit and talk.


888
01:05:27.284 --> 01:05:29.307
I must go.

889
01:05:29.331 --> 01:05:32.508
Don't you realize
what happened between us is good?


890
01:05:32.532 --> 01:05:35.090
Can't you see that?

891
01:05:40.884 --> 01:05:42.930
Edward?

892
01:05:46.772 --> 01:05:49.876
Edward, are you there?

893
01:06:20.854 --> 01:06:23.315
Are you still awake?

894
01:06:23.702 --> 01:06:26.544
I hope I didn't worry you.

895
01:06:28.439 --> 01:06:32.608
I had visions
of you going over a cliff in all that fog.


896
01:06:32.632 --> 01:06:34.994
What happened?

897
01:06:36.120 --> 01:06:38.878
I pulled the car
to the side and waited for it to lift.


898
01:06:38.902 --> 01:06:43.186
It didn't, and I fell asleep.

899
01:06:44.664 --> 01:06:46.656
Miserable

900
01:06:46.680 --> 01:06:50.133
- Were you praying when I came in?
- No


901
01:06:50.744 --> 01:06:54.655
I don't know... 
I was thinking.

902
01:06:54.679 --> 01:06:58.395
Thinking is almost always a kind of prayer.

903
01:06:59.769 --> 01:07:02.611
I'm so glad you're safe.

904
01:07:02.745 --> 01:07:05.467
I do love you, Edward.

905
01:07:48.190 --> 01:07:50.137
Damn

906
01:08:44.193 --> 01:08:47.466
I tried to pray,
you know, but I couldn't

907
01:08:47.490 --> 01:08:50.888
because I knew
that whatever I should've thought about it


908
01:08:50.912 --> 01:08:55.042
inevitably I would've
been praying not to forget you


909
01:08:55.521 --> 01:08:57.674
but to possess you.

910
01:08:57.698 --> 01:09:02.442
And that you felt you could arrange
without heavenly interference?


911
01:09:02.466 --> 01:09:04.874
A do-it-yourself kind of a proposition?

912
01:09:04.898 --> 01:09:06.634
Exactly.

913
01:09:06.658 --> 01:09:10.276
You see, I've lost all
of my sense of sin.

914
01:09:11.521 --> 01:09:14.571
It's about
the nicest thing a person could lose.


915
01:09:14.595 --> 01:09:19.237
Also, I have become
one of the world's most accomplished liars.


916
01:09:19.266 --> 01:09:21.802
You have lots of competition.

917
01:09:21.826 --> 01:09:24.427
Do you know what I told my wife?

918
01:09:24.451 --> 01:09:29.660
I said I was going to San Francisco
for three days on a fundraising drive.


919
01:09:30.244 --> 01:09:33.101
I have no intention
of going to San Francisco.

920
01:09:33.125 --> 01:09:36.807
That is, unless you kick me out.

921
01:09:37.156 --> 01:09:40.333
I won't kick you out. 
I'd be afraid to.

922
01:09:40.357 --> 01:09:44.365
You might get
a court order from Judge Thompson.


923
01:09:44.389 --> 01:09:47.437
What would it be?
A writ for search and seizure?


924
01:09:47.461 --> 01:09:52.834
No. A writ of
habeas corpus demanding delivery of the body.


925
01:09:52.837 --> 01:09:55.777
- And I'd have to?
- Of course.


926
01:09:56.197 --> 01:09:58.605
I'd see you in hell first.

927
01:09:58.629 --> 01:10:01.864
Sooner or later, you will anyway.

928
01:10:13.317 --> 01:10:16.398
You know, he's becoming a nuisance.

929
01:10:16.422 --> 01:10:18.766
You know,
you were quite right to let him fly free.


930
01:10:18.790 --> 01:10:21.551
How did you know about that?

931
01:10:21.575 --> 01:10:25.736
Life always
flies back to life if it isn't penned up.


932
01:10:26.278 --> 01:10:28.686
You know, I've been
keeping him on the porch during the daytime


933
01:10:28.710 --> 01:10:32.207
so that he can
see the ocean and see the birds


934
01:10:32.231 --> 01:10:34.864
so he can know
what he's supposed to be.

935
01:10:34.888 --> 01:10:38.123
And when he does, he'll leave you.

936
01:10:39.528 --> 01:10:42.336
And so will you, my love.

937
01:11:08.298 --> 01:11:10.931
I think he's ready to try the outside.

938
01:11:10.955 --> 01:11:13.202
He's had
enough porch time to find his way back


939
01:11:13.226 --> 01:11:16.242
if he gets frightened or lonely.

940
01:11:16.266 --> 01:11:18.595
Wait a second.

941
01:11:33.867 --> 01:11:36.742
Come on, little sandpiper.

942
01:11:38.923 --> 01:11:41.645
Don't be afraid, baby.

943
01:11:42.091 --> 01:11:44.815
You can fly through it.

944
01:11:46.347 --> 01:11:49.255
He's making his own prison.

945
01:12:03.212 --> 01:12:05.192
Look.

946
01:12:15.244 --> 01:12:17.781
I think they're watching us.

947
01:12:17.805 --> 01:12:19.701
And they don't like us.

948
01:12:19.725 --> 01:12:22.229
We're intruders. 
Nobody ever comes here.

949
01:12:22.253 --> 01:12:25.193
And they prefer it that way.

950
01:12:26.254 --> 01:12:29.686
The only way
you can get in is through that inlet.


951
01:12:29.710 --> 01:12:33.000
I feel as alone as Robinson Crusoe

952
01:12:33.263 --> 01:12:36.119
even with the footprints
of a man beside me.

953
01:12:36.143 --> 01:12:40.119
You should always
have a man's footprints beside you, Laura.


954
01:12:40.143 --> 01:12:42.486
How do you know I haven't always?

955
01:12:42.510 --> 01:12:44.759
Because you're afraid of them.

956
01:12:44.783 --> 01:12:47.863
- Want some more wine?
- No, thanks.


957
01:12:47.887 --> 01:12:51.208
But I'm not as afraid as you think.

958
01:12:52.303 --> 01:12:53.591
Do you think that one of these days

959
01:12:53.615 --> 01:12:57.240
Danny's going to
feel somehow that you robbed him of a father?


960
01:12:57.264 --> 01:13:00.599
Well that's a chance I'm
going to have to take.

961
01:13:00.623 --> 01:13:02.615
Do you know something?

962
01:13:02.639 --> 01:13:05.207
If I were a devoted widow

963
01:13:05.231 --> 01:13:08.023
and Danny's father were a dead war hero

964
01:13:08.047 --> 01:13:10.328
would you be pitching me this bit about

965
01:13:10.352 --> 01:13:14.219
finding a second father
to replace the dead one?


966
01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:16.407
TouchÃ©.

967
01:13:16.431 --> 01:13:19.568
<i>Bonne santÃ©.</i>  Continue the pitch.

968
01:13:20.368 --> 01:13:23.833
It's no pitch. I just want to
find out what you want from life. That's all.


969
01:13:23.857 --> 01:13:27.146
Oh aside from raising Danny

970
01:13:27.504 --> 01:13:32.397
most of all
I want to know myself to be myself.


971
01:13:32.528 --> 01:13:34.777
I won't have a chance to do that

972
01:13:34.801 --> 01:13:37.593
if I spend my life
playing the matrimony game


973
01:13:37.617 --> 01:13:40.121
which was rigged before I was even born.

974
01:13:40.145 --> 01:13:41.241
Rigged?

975
01:13:41.265 --> 01:13:43.833
Of course it's rigged. 
It always has been.

976
01:13:43.857 --> 01:13:45.817
The first 20 years of a girl's life

977
01:13:45.841 --> 01:13:50.233
she gets so used to
going to the same schools as the boys


978
01:13:50.257 --> 01:13:52.441
taking the same classes

979
01:13:52.465 --> 01:13:54.938
living in the same world with him

980
01:13:54.962 --> 01:13:58.139
that she can't get it
through that square little head of hers


981
01:13:58.163 --> 01:13:59.931
that she isn't his absolute equal

982
01:13:59.955 --> 01:14:01.371
which, of course, she is.

983
01:14:01.395 --> 01:14:04.379
Just wait until
they get married and then see what happens.


984
01:14:04.403 --> 01:14:07.290
The man enters into a professional life.

985
01:14:07.314 --> 01:14:10.875
The woman
becomes an unpaid domestic servant.


986
01:14:10.899 --> 01:14:12.763
So there goes your equality.

987
01:14:12.787 --> 01:14:17.364
What good does all that
education do except make her unhappy?


988
01:14:17.747 --> 01:14:20.603
Well perhaps it's something
to fall back on when her beauty fades


989
01:14:20.627 --> 01:14:23.996
and her husband turns to a younger woman.

990
01:14:24.020 --> 01:14:26.747
I wasn't talking about you

991
01:14:26.771 --> 01:14:29.492
or any individual man.

992
01:14:29.555 --> 01:14:33.303
- I was talking about men as a group.
- I know


993
01:14:33.396 --> 01:14:35.581
but most women who become homemakers

994
01:14:35.605 --> 01:14:38.140
are not necessarily miserable.

995
01:14:38.164 --> 01:14:40.028
I didn't say miserable.

996
01:14:40.052 --> 01:14:42.524
I say they're unfulfilled.

997
01:14:42.548 --> 01:14:45.565
Look, a man
is always a husband and a father


998
01:14:45.589 --> 01:14:48.445
and something else, like a doctor.

999
01:14:48.469 --> 01:14:52.253
A woman is
a wife and a mother and what else?


1000
01:14:52.277 --> 01:14:54.077
A nothing.

1001
01:14:54.101 --> 01:14:57.020
The nothing is the thing that kills her

1002
01:14:57.044 --> 01:14:58.941
and you don't care.

1003
01:14:58.965 --> 01:15:01.533
You want her to stay
just the way she is:

1004
01:15:01.557 --> 01:15:05.905
fertile and unfulfilled, then in her place.

1005
01:15:05.909 --> 01:15:07.229
Who wants this?

1006
01:15:07.253 --> 01:15:10.878
Oh creatures like you, judges like Thompson

1007
01:15:10.902 --> 01:15:13.501
all the doctors, the President

1008
01:15:13.525 --> 01:15:16.925
the whole male establishment,
every last one of you.


1009
01:15:16.949 --> 01:15:19.742
You make it sound like one enormous conspiracy.

1010
01:15:19.766 --> 01:15:21.598
Well of course it is.

1011
01:15:21.622 --> 01:15:25.076
Ever since Adam stool-pigeoned on Eve.

1012
01:15:25.623 --> 01:15:27.583
Oh damn!

1013
01:15:27.607 --> 01:15:30.079
- Don't do that.
- Well you made me spoil it.


1014
01:15:30.103 --> 01:15:32.990
Sometimes you're no judge of what's no good.

1015
01:15:33.014 --> 01:15:34.496
What is it?

1016
01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:37.787
- Now let me see.
- It's you.


1017
01:15:43.543 --> 01:15:46.400
Adam, after he stool-pigeoned...

1018
01:15:46.424 --> 01:15:47.776
Where's Eve?

1019
01:15:47.800 --> 01:15:51.799
Standing
behind the tree looking morally superior.


1020
01:15:52.919 --> 01:15:55.200
<i>But smugness, like pride</i>

1021
01:15:55.224 --> 01:15:57.376
<i>goeth before destruction</i>

1022
01:15:57.400 --> 01:16:00.024
<i>and a haughty spirit</i>

1023
01:16:01.657 --> 01:16:03.986
<i>before a fall.</i>

1024
01:17:23.998 --> 01:17:27.832
Is this something close to married love?

1025
01:17:28.829 --> 01:17:31.006
Well I...

1026
01:17:31.038 --> 01:17:33.542
Did you expect
there would be a great difference?


1027
01:17:33.566 --> 01:17:36.833
Well yes, wouldn't you?

1028
01:17:37.566 --> 01:17:39.302
I don't...

1029
01:17:39.326 --> 01:17:42.561
I don't really know. 
Why do you ask?

1030
01:17:43.646 --> 01:17:45.414
Well because I've never known anything

1031
01:17:45.438 --> 01:17:48.807
like this
particular feeling that I feel with you


1032
01:17:48.831 --> 01:17:50.471
never before

1033
01:17:50.495 --> 01:17:52.824
never at all.

1034
01:17:52.894 --> 01:17:56.183
I've, of course, wondered about it.

1035
01:17:57.534 --> 01:18:01.184
Is it like married love?

1036
01:18:02.847 --> 01:18:04.903
It's, well... It's difficult to...

1037
01:18:04.927 --> 01:18:09.275
I'm not prying.
I don't want to know any secrets.


1038
01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:14.845
It's just...
well the way we touch each other


1039
01:18:15.104 --> 01:18:17.575
the way you feel to me

1040
01:18:17.599 --> 01:18:19.976
and I to you, I suppose

1041
01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:23.870
the pleasure
that comes whenever I think of you:


1042
01:18:27.714 --> 01:18:31.035
Does this happen to married people?

1043
01:18:32.002 --> 01:18:33.916
Yes

1044
01:18:35.938 --> 01:18:38.529
Oh God, I envy her.

1045
01:18:40.194 --> 01:18:41.578
I hate her.

1046
01:18:41.602 --> 01:18:44.618
I hate her
and I envy he and I want to be her.


1047
01:18:44.642 --> 01:18:46.972
Please, Laura.

1048
01:18:49.795 --> 01:18:52.669
It's such a terrible trap.

1049
01:18:54.369 --> 01:18:56.961
I do want to be her

1050
01:19:00.772 --> 01:19:03.013
except now.

1051
01:19:03.363 --> 01:19:06.219
Right now, I only want to be me

1052
01:19:06.243 --> 01:19:09.131
only me in the whole world

1053
01:19:09.155 --> 01:19:11.266
only me.

1054
01:19:46.758 --> 01:19:49.709
You almost scared me
to death and I called the St. Francis


1055
01:19:49.733 --> 01:19:53.550
and the clerk said that you weren't there
and you hadn't even made a reservation.


1056
01:19:53.574 --> 01:19:55.662
The clerk was wrong. 
I had made a reservation.

1057
01:19:55.686 --> 01:19:59.969
Then Phil Sutcliff
fixed me up at the Union League Club.


1058
01:20:01.222 --> 01:20:03.247
I canceled the hotel. 
I meant to let you know

1059
01:20:03.271 --> 01:20:05.135
but the whole thing completely slipped my mind.

1060
01:20:05.159 --> 01:20:06.510
Well everything worked out anyway.

1061
01:20:06.534 --> 01:20:09.390
I ran into
Ward Hendricks in Carmel the next day.


1062
01:20:09.414 --> 01:20:10.992
I asked about you.

1063
01:20:11.016 --> 01:20:14.191
He said he had seen you
in San Francisco and you were just fine.


1064
01:20:14.215 --> 01:20:16.047
Ward Hendricks said...

1065
01:20:16.071 --> 01:20:18.863
Oh he's back in Carmel already?

1066
01:20:18.887 --> 01:20:22.209
- Did the pledges go well?
- The what?


1067
01:20:22.663 --> 01:20:25.072
San Francisco, the chapel?

1068
01:20:25.096 --> 01:20:28.297
Oh the pledges. 
Yes yes quite well.

1069
01:20:29.223 --> 01:20:34.793
Claire, I've been thinking that I might
abandon the idea of a chapel altogether.


1070
01:20:34.887 --> 01:20:36.784
With all the pledges you've got?

1071
01:20:36.808 --> 01:20:39.056
and the trustees meeting set at Del Monte?

1072
01:20:39.080 --> 01:20:42.500
- Yes
- Well why, Edward?


1073
01:20:43.528 --> 01:20:48.105
I mean, if there's
some problem about the chapel I don't know of


1074
01:20:48.137 --> 01:20:50.760
maybe I can help you.

1075
01:20:51.977 --> 01:20:54.851
I can't right now, Claire.

1076
01:20:55.400 --> 01:20:58.256
I'm not quite sure of the problem myself.

1077
01:20:58.280 --> 01:21:01.201
Actually,
I'm quite tired. Do you mind if I go to bed?


1078
01:21:01.225 --> 01:21:03.783
I'll come with you.

1079
01:21:23.371 --> 01:21:25.651
That's very good.
Do you think it'll hold up in a tax court?


1080
01:21:25.675 --> 01:21:29.299
With two certified appraisals?
The lowest one's got to stand up.


1081
01:21:29.323 --> 01:21:33.491
Even that's a fat $22,000 tax deduction
for paintings that cost me under $5,000.


1082
01:21:33.515 --> 01:21:34.803
So what's the problem?

1083
01:21:34.827 --> 01:21:38.323
Well I'm trying to give
the damn things to Ed Hewitt's Chapel Fund


1084
01:21:38.347 --> 01:21:40.083
- and he won't take them.
- Why not?


1085
01:21:40.107 --> 01:21:42.131
I think he objects to the tax angle

1086
01:21:42.155 --> 01:21:45.075
says he won't let his
Chapel Fund take two or three grand from me


1087
01:21:45.099 --> 01:21:47.700
so that I can
take 22 from the government.

1088
01:21:47.724 --> 01:21:51.124
Well if the government says it's OK
what the hell is he worried about?


1089
01:21:51.148 --> 01:21:53.652
Well that's why I thought
maybe you could talk to him, Ward


1090
01:21:53.676 --> 01:21:55.028
you know, make him see the light.

1091
01:21:55.052 --> 01:21:57.875
I'll be glad to.
I might want the same deal myself sometime.


1092
01:21:57.899 --> 01:22:01.397
Well in that case
why don't you talk to him right now?


1093
01:22:01.421 --> 01:22:02.484
What?

1094
01:22:02.508 --> 01:22:05.481
Well he's sitting right over there.

1095
01:22:05.708 --> 01:22:08.616
- Where?
- Over by the window.


1096
01:22:18.733 --> 01:22:21.455
Well look who's here.

1097
01:22:21.900 --> 01:22:24.053
My two favorite saints.

1098
01:22:24.077 --> 01:22:26.262
Hello, Ward.

1099
01:22:26.286 --> 01:22:29.717
- Spending the weekend in Monterey?
- The afternoon.


1100
01:22:29.741 --> 01:22:31.509
Oh

1101
01:22:31.533 --> 01:22:33.749
I'm down for
Ed's trustee meeting in Del Monte.


1102
01:22:33.773 --> 01:22:35.189
It should break before dinnertime.

1103
01:22:35.213 --> 01:22:36.886
Maybe if you're
still around, we can do the town.


1104
01:22:36.910 --> 01:22:39.119
I won't be.

1105
01:22:39.277 --> 01:22:41.704
Some other time.

1106
01:22:41.998 --> 01:22:43.957
There is something
I'd like to talk to you about.


1107
01:22:43.981 --> 01:22:46.805
Maybe we could get together
before the trustees start conning each other.


1108
01:22:46.829 --> 01:22:48.566
I'm tied up for this afternoon.

1109
01:22:48.590 --> 01:22:51.734
What do you say,
around 4:30 or 5:00? It's important.


1110
01:22:51.758 --> 01:22:55.031
Besides, I think you owe me a favor.

1111
01:22:55.055 --> 01:22:57.047
I'm not aware
of any favors given or owed, Ward.


1112
01:22:57.071 --> 01:22:59.351
However, I'll meet you
at 5:00. Will the lodge be all right?


1113
01:22:59.375 --> 01:23:01.356
Fine.

1114
01:23:02.896 --> 01:23:06.251
Cheers. See you later.

1115
01:23:19.632 --> 01:23:22.776
It seems to me, you've got
a lot of explaining to do, old boy.


1116
01:23:22.800 --> 01:23:26.617
That figure for the chapel is 50% higher

1117
01:23:26.641 --> 01:23:29.400
- than the figure you gave us last year.
- Exactly.


1118
01:23:29.424 --> 01:23:32.056
We can presume therefore
that the present figure is merely a prelude


1119
01:23:32.080 --> 01:23:33.720
to further fiscal miscalculations

1120
01:23:33.744 --> 01:23:37.082
and continued
embarrassment to the headmaster.


1121
01:23:37.106 --> 01:23:38.330
I've come to the conclusion

1122
01:23:38.354 --> 01:23:42.636
that so vast a sum
would be misspent on a chapel anyhow.


1123
01:23:42.834 --> 01:23:46.746
What I'm asking
is that the Chapel Building Fund


1124
01:23:46.770 --> 01:23:50.490
be used as the nucleus
for an expanding free scholarship fund


1125
01:23:50.514 --> 01:23:55.921
for the education
of gifted but underprivileged boys.


1126
01:23:57.618 --> 01:24:01.467
Having stated the matter that simply
I will spare you any further oratory


1127
01:24:01.491 --> 01:24:04.859
and throw the matter
open for general discussion.


1128
01:24:04.883 --> 01:24:06.747
What does that mean to him anyway?

1129
01:24:06.771 --> 01:24:09.402
It looks to me as,
once you lower social standards


1130
01:24:09.426 --> 01:24:11.578
academic standards have got to follow:

1131
01:24:11.602 --> 01:24:13.532
Gresham's law applied to education.

1132
01:24:13.556 --> 01:24:15.963
We're not going to
accept these boys simply because they're poor.


1133
01:24:15.987 --> 01:24:19.419
We accept them because
they're bright and just happen to be poor.


1134
01:24:19.443 --> 01:24:22.652
Either we break down
the exclusiveness we've been practicing


1135
01:24:22.676 --> 01:24:24.733
or risk crippling the minds of our children

1136
01:24:24.757 --> 01:24:27.645
with class and racial concepts

1137
01:24:27.669 --> 01:24:30.524
that have no place
in modern life, much less in Christian dogma.


1138
01:24:30.548 --> 01:24:31.676
Hear, hear!

1139
01:24:31.700 --> 01:24:34.108
That's all very well
but I think you're missing the point.


1140
01:24:34.132 --> 01:24:36.574
Our donors didn't give
their money for scholarships. They gave it


1141
01:24:36.598 --> 01:24:39.357
because they wanted a more beautiful
place of worship for their children.


1142
01:24:39.381 --> 01:24:42.493
I think our
present chapel is quite beautiful enough


1143
01:24:42.517 --> 01:24:45.917
to sustain
the quality of prayer that rises from it.


1144
01:24:45.941 --> 01:24:47.965
Tell that to our donors
and they'll demand their money back.


1145
01:24:47.989 --> 01:24:51.262
I'm aware of that. Our task
will be to persuade them otherwise.


1146
01:24:51.286 --> 01:24:52.862
Our task?

1147
01:24:52.886 --> 01:24:56.285
You speak for yourself.
I don't raise money under false pretenses.


1148
01:24:56.309 --> 01:24:57.438
You talk of false pretenses

1149
01:24:57.462 --> 01:25:00.575
after the tax avoidance scheme you tried
to put over on me less than an hour ago?


1150
01:25:00.599 --> 01:25:03.997
Tax avoidance?
He turned down a perfectly legal gift


1151
01:25:04.021 --> 01:25:06.910
that would've netted
the Building Fund $3,000 or $4,000 minimum.


1152
01:25:06.934 --> 01:25:08.766
You've always
accepted those gifts in the past.


1153
01:25:08.790 --> 01:25:10.366
Now do you dare deny that?

1154
01:25:10.390 --> 01:25:13.297
No. I affirm it

1155
01:25:14.806 --> 01:25:16.702
and I'm ashamed of it.

1156
01:25:16.726 --> 01:25:18.078
I've got to put a stop to this.

1157
01:25:18.102 --> 01:25:20.223
From now on
San Simeon will only accept those gifts


1158
01:25:20.247 --> 01:25:23.038
that come at least within
shooting distance of your fancy appraisals.


1159
01:25:23.062 --> 01:25:25.888
Why don't you stop?
What the hell has gotten into you anyway?


1160
01:25:25.912 --> 01:25:28.831
- You've never talked like this before.
- Listen, Ward, your ideas...


1161
01:25:28.855 --> 01:25:31.999
My ideas
may not be perfect, but they are my ideas.


1162
01:25:32.023 --> 01:25:35.738
Where do you get yours from? 
Laura Reynolds?

1163
01:25:43.255 --> 01:25:47.002
I don't understand it. 
I don't expect you to.

1164
01:25:47.480 --> 01:25:50.305
I don't understand it myself.

1165
01:25:50.329 --> 01:25:52.545
We made love.

1166
01:25:52.569 --> 01:25:55.541
Even in motels, God help me.

1167
01:25:56.121 --> 01:25:58.177
Stop the car.

1168
01:25:58.201 --> 01:26:00.116
Why?

1169
01:26:00.570 --> 01:26:02.680
I'm sick.

1170
01:26:06.074 --> 01:26:08.861
- Claire.
- Leave me alone!


1171
01:26:12.826 --> 01:26:14.773
Why?

1172
01:26:19.833 --> 01:26:22.945
- Claire, can I...
- Leave me alone!


1173
01:26:22.969 --> 01:26:25.528
- Claire!
- No!


1174
01:26:27.195 --> 01:26:29.762
- Claire, please...
- You leave me alone. I want to walk.


1175
01:26:29.786 --> 01:26:32.290
- Claire.
- Don't talk to me. I have to be alone.


1176
01:26:32.314 --> 01:26:34.274
- Claire!
- Go to her!


1177
01:26:34.298 --> 01:26:39.355
It's she you must talk to now, not me.
You must leave me alone!


1178
01:26:45.402 --> 01:26:47.611
Hey Laura!

1179
01:26:55.067 --> 01:26:57.276
Hey Laura!

1180
01:27:05.692 --> 01:27:08.419
I've great news
for you. We're so proud of you.


1181
01:27:08.443 --> 01:27:10.691
Ellie McIver
bought two of your paintings today


1182
01:27:10.715 --> 01:27:12.292
at $300 a piece

1183
01:27:12.316 --> 01:27:13.828
by the permission of God

1184
01:27:13.852 --> 01:27:15.844
plus 25 bucks for food and drinks!

1185
01:27:15.868 --> 01:27:19.396
Not only that. The Edward Gallery
in San Francisco wants to give you a show.


1186
01:27:19.420 --> 01:27:23.103
- I don't believe it.
- Well will you believe this loot?


1187
01:27:48.190 --> 01:27:50.759
Well Laura, this is your night.

1188
01:27:50.783 --> 01:27:55.110
If you hadn't given me that buildup
with McIver, this never would have happened.


1189
01:27:55.134 --> 01:27:57.702
Come on.
This is the baby you're talking to, honey.


1190
01:27:57.726 --> 01:27:59.591
Don't try giving me that.

1191
01:27:59.615 --> 01:28:02.206
It was the preacher.

1192
01:28:02.463 --> 01:28:06.046
When are you going to conclude that scene?

1193
01:28:07.487 --> 01:28:09.479
I don't know.

1194
01:28:09.503 --> 01:28:12.345
You're in dangerous orbit.

1195
01:28:12.575 --> 01:28:14.952
Maybe more for him than for you.

1196
01:28:14.976 --> 01:28:17.218
Oh I know.

1197
01:28:17.375 --> 01:28:20.610
I keep trying to find a way to...

1198
01:28:20.671 --> 01:28:24.441
I keep thinking, just one more month

1199
01:28:24.511 --> 01:28:26.874
one more week

1200
01:28:27.361 --> 01:28:29.886
just one more day.

1201
01:28:30.048 --> 01:28:33.501
What's so special about this preacher?

1202
01:28:33.568 --> 01:28:36.840
Something I never knew really existed.

1203
01:28:36.864 --> 01:28:40.831
All right. Come on, come on. 
Let's get it out.

1204
01:28:41.345 --> 01:28:43.554
Tenderness.

1205
01:28:44.993 --> 01:28:49.723
I never knew a
man could be so strong

1206
01:28:50.787 --> 01:28:52.267
yet so tender.

1207
01:28:52.291 --> 01:28:54.784
That's even worse.

1208
01:28:55.139 --> 01:28:58.699
Stop messing around, baby.
It can't go anywhere but wrong.


1209
01:28:58.723 --> 01:29:00.554
You're wrong

1210
01:29:00.578 --> 01:29:03.137
because I love him.

1211
01:29:03.492 --> 01:29:06.759
I never knew what love was before.

1212
01:29:10.468 --> 01:29:13.638
Now I know what
I want in a man

1213
01:29:14.276 --> 01:29:16.780
even in a marriage

1214
01:29:16.804 --> 01:29:19.372
and I will find it someday.

1215
01:29:19.396 --> 01:29:22.467
- Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.
- Again.


1216
01:29:25.573 --> 01:29:28.781
Do you know
the trouble with me and hard liquor?


1217
01:29:28.805 --> 01:29:32.460
I get it
so seldom that I forget how to handle it.


1218
01:29:32.484 --> 01:29:34.628
Poor Cos.

1219
01:29:36.068 --> 01:29:37.901
Yeah, poor old Cos.

1220
01:29:37.925 --> 01:29:41.989
Caught drunk
right in the middle of a losing streak


1221
01:29:42.149 --> 01:29:44.543
lost his youth

1222
01:29:44.645 --> 01:29:46.445
lost his girl

1223
01:29:46.469 --> 01:29:49.441
- lost his...
- sense of humor.


1224
01:29:52.325 --> 01:29:54.207
Does that make it any better?

1225
01:30:08.615 --> 01:30:12.239
What are you
doing here? Do you want everybody to know?


1226
01:30:12.263 --> 01:30:14.757
We've got to talk.

1227
01:30:15.655 --> 01:30:17.700
Come on.

1228
01:30:18.439 --> 01:30:19.728
Fill me in on something.

1229
01:30:19.752 --> 01:30:22.800
Did you ever hear of an honest preacher?

1230
01:30:22.824 --> 01:30:26.321
Just don't lose
your cool, man. Don't lose your cool.


1231
01:30:26.345 --> 01:30:28.112
No, I'm asking you straight.

1232
01:30:28.136 --> 01:30:30.161
Did you ever hear of an honest preacher?

1233
01:30:30.185 --> 01:30:31.729
You leave them alone, Cos.

1234
01:30:31.753 --> 01:30:34.889
You mean you told her about me?

1235
01:30:35.401 --> 01:30:37.315
Yes

1236
01:30:38.697 --> 01:30:40.786
That we've made love?

1237
01:30:40.810 --> 01:30:42.757
Yes

1238
01:30:45.481 --> 01:30:48.203
How could you?

1239
01:30:49.064 --> 01:30:53.227
How could you
bring yourself to tell anyone about me?


1240
01:30:54.056 --> 01:30:56.550
It's too private.

1241
01:30:57.001 --> 01:31:00.040
It's too private to tell.

1242
01:31:00.553 --> 01:31:03.309
I felt she had to know.

1243
01:31:03.914 --> 01:31:07.058
Isn't the relationship
between a man and a woman in love


1244
01:31:07.082 --> 01:31:11.378
as privileged
as between a lawyer and a client?


1245
01:31:11.402 --> 01:31:13.266
...a doctor and a patient?

1246
01:31:13.290 --> 01:31:16.493
...a priest and a confessant?

1247
01:31:16.554 --> 01:31:19.942
Isn't it just as holy?

1248
01:31:19.946 --> 01:31:22.418
Laura, it is holy. 
I swear to you it is.

1249
01:31:22.442 --> 01:31:24.722
Not with you.

1250
01:31:24.746 --> 01:31:27.916
Not when it's with me.

1251
01:31:28.011 --> 01:31:31.016
- Laura.
- Don't touch me!


1252
01:31:33.387 --> 01:31:35.628
Go away.

1253
01:31:39.308 --> 01:31:42.150
Go back to your wife.

1254
01:31:42.188 --> 01:31:43.988
- Laura.
- No no.


1255
01:31:44.012 --> 01:31:46.195
Leave me alone.

1256
01:31:46.219 --> 01:31:49.108
- You heard what she said. Leave her alone.
- Get out of my way.


1257
01:31:49.132 --> 01:31:50.933
I have known hypocritical clerics in my time

1258
01:31:50.957 --> 01:31:52.309
- but you lead the parade.
- Cos!


1259
01:31:52.333 --> 01:31:53.621
Edward, stop it.

1260
01:31:53.645 --> 01:31:56.170
Sniffing around here like a hound dog.

1261
01:31:58.221 --> 01:31:59.445
Edward.

1262
01:31:59.469 --> 01:32:01.461
There's no need
for that, preacher. Why don't you go back


1263
01:32:01.485 --> 01:32:04.458
- to corrupting little boys?
- Edward.


1264
01:32:10.669 --> 01:32:12.469
Stop it. You'll kill him.

1265
01:32:12.493 --> 01:32:15.254
Stop it. Stop it, Edward.

1266
01:32:15.278 --> 01:32:18.895
Edward. Edward!

1267
01:32:19.534 --> 01:32:22.125
Oh God!

1268
01:32:25.134 --> 01:32:27.561
He's all right.

1269
01:32:27.663 --> 01:32:29.782
I just tapped him. 
He'll come to in a moment.

1270
01:32:29.806 --> 01:32:31.990
What's going on here, Cos? What's wrong?

1271
01:32:32.014 --> 01:32:35.336
- There's nothing wrong.
- Are you all right?


1272
01:32:35.438 --> 01:32:38.641
Edward, Edward

1273
01:32:43.087 --> 01:32:45.743
I wanted to kill him.

1274
01:32:47.439 --> 01:32:50.062
I wanted to kill him.

1275
01:32:52.911 --> 01:32:54.956
Edward

1276
01:32:56.719 --> 01:32:59.441
Ask him to forgive me.

1277
01:33:02.063 --> 01:33:04.109
Edward

1278
01:33:20.753 --> 01:33:24.042
- Good morning.
- Good morning.


1279
01:33:28.082 --> 01:33:31.796
You've slept four nights in the library now.

1280
01:33:32.529 --> 01:33:35.339
Where would you have me sleep?

1281
01:33:36.113 --> 01:33:40.014
Separately,
of course. I made no complaint. I...


1282
01:33:41.938 --> 01:33:45.205
I really think it's time we talked.

1283
01:33:46.450 --> 01:33:49.260
What are you going to do?

1284
01:33:51.539 --> 01:33:53.846
I don't know.

1285
01:34:02.258 --> 01:34:04.411
You bear no responsibility for what's happened

1286
01:34:04.435 --> 01:34:07.227
and neither does Laura Reynolds.

1287
01:34:07.251 --> 01:34:10.043
It was my
betrayal of myself that injured you both


1288
01:34:10.067 --> 01:34:15.539
self-betrayal that
began years ago almost without my knowledge.


1289
01:34:17.651 --> 01:34:22.479
Have you any
conception of how corrupt I've become?


1290
01:34:22.580 --> 01:34:24.124
In what way?

1291
01:34:24.148 --> 01:34:28.431
By acquiescing
in a thousand little schemes that pertain


1292
01:34:28.660 --> 01:34:30.427
to charity and end up as profit

1293
01:34:30.451 --> 01:34:34.483
by overlooking a boy's grades

1294
01:34:34.740 --> 01:34:38.811
for a bribe called "contribution"

1295
01:34:38.835 --> 01:34:42.704
by putting desire above duty

1296
01:34:43.316 --> 01:34:45.820
and ambition above dignity.

1297
01:34:45.844 --> 01:34:48.797
Why all this self-contempt?

1298
01:34:48.821 --> 01:34:52.030
Unhappily,
I'm no longer a man of religion, Claire.


1299
01:34:52.054 --> 01:34:55.375
I've become a fundraiser

1300
01:34:55.989 --> 01:34:57.438
a sloganeer

1301
01:34:57.462 --> 01:34:59.357
a keeper of the treasury.

1302
01:34:59.381 --> 01:35:02.622
I'm not even an educator anymore. I've...

1303
01:35:02.646 --> 01:35:05.214
I've become
a business executive who doesn't have the time


1304
01:35:05.238 --> 01:35:08.254
even to make
the acquaintance of his own students


1305
01:35:08.278 --> 01:35:11.678
but those tasks
make the difference between a fine school


1306
01:35:11.702 --> 01:35:13.438
and a mediocre one.

1307
01:35:13.462 --> 01:35:16.223
You've performed them
well, apparently willingly.


1308
01:35:16.247 --> 01:35:19.167
They're simply
not the tasks I chose for myself 20 years ago.


1309
01:35:19.191 --> 01:35:23.222
...that we chose.

1310
01:35:24.119 --> 01:35:26.426
Do you remember?

1311
01:35:27.223 --> 01:35:29.552
I never forgot.

1312
01:35:33.143 --> 01:35:38.418
We were God's sweet fools.

1313
01:35:39.288 --> 01:35:44.214
We were going to minister to the poor

1314
01:35:44.247 --> 01:35:48.415
live in perfect trust, one with the other

1315
01:35:48.439 --> 01:35:52.406
to trace in our lives

1316
01:35:54.264 --> 01:35:57.881
the gentle footsteps of Francis of Assisi.

1317
01:36:01.688 --> 01:36:04.563
We were going to call it...

1318
01:36:04.985 --> 01:36:07.608
It seems so long ago.

1319
01:36:08.313 --> 01:36:13.490
We were going to call it,
of all things, "The Ministry of Love."


1320
01:36:15.417 --> 01:36:19.035
And she carried you back

1321
01:36:19.802 --> 01:36:22.874
to all those young, hot hopes

1322
01:36:23.290 --> 01:36:28.021
all those brave, old dreams.

1323
01:36:28.475 --> 01:36:31.676
I'm just beginning to understand

1324
01:36:34.715 --> 01:36:37.622
just beginning to grasp it.

1325
01:36:39.195 --> 01:36:43.773
But do you think
I like what I've become

1326
01:36:44.348 --> 01:36:48.356
with the boys
grown and raised and not needing me anymore?


1327
01:36:48.380 --> 01:36:51.670
and me filling these unwanted years

1328
01:36:52.829 --> 01:36:56.598
with petty tasks
and busy little trivialities?


1329
01:36:58.748 --> 01:37:02.852
What would you do
if you left this school?

1330
01:37:02.876 --> 01:37:07.421
Churches everywhere
are calling for ministers who won't come.


1331
01:37:09.085 --> 01:37:12.900
The neighborhood is bad or
the pay is too low

1332
01:37:12.924 --> 01:37:16.037
or the congregation is the wrong color.

1333
01:37:16.061 --> 01:37:19.142
And if you stayed here, then what?

1334
01:37:19.166 --> 01:37:21.444
It's up to the trustees.

1335
01:37:21.468 --> 01:37:25.861
I don't think they'll
want me after my blowup with Hendricks.


1336
01:37:25.885 --> 01:37:30.616
I'm not talking about
the trustees. I'm talking about this girl.


1337
01:37:30.814 --> 01:37:35.772
You were in love
with her. Are you still in love with her?


1338
01:37:35.934 --> 01:37:37.848
Yes

1339
01:37:38.141 --> 01:37:40.998
I'm afraid so. Yes, I am

1340
01:37:41.022 --> 01:37:43.334
in a way I can't hope to explain.

1341
01:37:43.358 --> 01:37:45.510
I can't expect you to understand

1342
01:37:45.534 --> 01:37:49.501
and I want
your understanding above anything else


1343
01:37:49.727 --> 01:37:54.589
because I must invite your contempt

1344
01:37:55.263 --> 01:37:59.207
by insisting that I love you too.

1345
01:37:59.231 --> 01:38:01.511
It's not possible.

1346
01:38:01.535 --> 01:38:03.847
Six months ago
I wouldn't have thought so either.


1347
01:38:03.872 --> 01:38:05.864
It's true.

1348
01:38:05.888 --> 01:38:09.373
I promise I won't
go back to her again.

1349
01:38:12.641 --> 01:38:15.428
It's an answer of sorts.

1350
01:38:15.680 --> 01:38:20.061
Enough to see me through the week.

1351
01:38:24.640 --> 01:38:27.329
Oh look. Is that him?

1352
01:38:28.706 --> 01:38:32.170
See how one wing
hangs just a little lower than the other?


1353
01:38:32.194 --> 01:38:34.761
Do you think he knows you?

1354
01:38:34.785 --> 01:38:38.761
Probably.
He cocks an eye at us every now and then.


1355
01:38:38.785 --> 01:38:40.138
He likes us.

1356
01:38:40.162 --> 01:38:42.884
Then why did he leave?

1357
01:38:43.073 --> 01:38:46.788
He was healed. 
He didn't need us anymore.

1358
01:38:47.938 --> 01:38:50.569
Listen, Danny. I have
a surprise for you. About school, I mean.


1359
01:38:50.593 --> 01:38:52.746
About school?

1360
01:38:52.770 --> 01:38:56.714
My paintings are beginning to sell.
Not always, just once in a while. But...


1361
01:38:56.738 --> 01:38:59.114
Well I can always get
a job to fill in

1362
01:38:59.138 --> 01:39:01.290
which means,
we can afford to move away from here


1363
01:39:01.314 --> 01:39:02.890
if you'd like to.

1364
01:39:02.914 --> 01:39:05.930
But where would we move to?

1365
01:39:05.954 --> 01:39:09.451
Oh San Francisco probably, or Monterey.

1366
01:39:09.475 --> 01:39:11.850
I'd get
an apartment and you can go to public school


1367
01:39:11.874 --> 01:39:14.794
instead of
San Simeon. We could live together again.


1368
01:39:14.818 --> 01:39:18.925
I just get used to something
and you want to start doing something else.


1369
01:39:18.949 --> 01:39:22.317
You mean, you...
you want to go back to San Simeon?


1370
01:39:22.341 --> 01:39:25.630
Well sure. I've got friends there.

1371
01:39:28.133 --> 01:39:31.565
You don't get homesick anymore? 
I mean, you...

1372
01:39:31.589 --> 01:39:33.581
You don't mind living without me?

1373
01:39:33.605 --> 01:39:38.117
Why should I?
You can't live with your mother all your life.


1374
01:39:39.173 --> 01:39:41.503
Of course not.

1375
01:39:47.558 --> 01:39:50.758
We all want to fly free, don't we?

1376
01:39:51.270 --> 01:39:53.359
OK. That's settled.

1377
01:39:53.383 --> 01:39:56.047
You'll go back to San
Simeon and I'll stay here.

1378
01:39:56.071 --> 01:39:59.631
The two of us will...
We can see each other on weekends.


1379
01:39:59.655 --> 01:40:01.230
Well if I'm going back next term

1380
01:40:01.254 --> 01:40:05.090
then you've
just got to come to Charter Sunday.


1381
01:40:06.695 --> 01:40:09.615
What's so important about Charter Sunday?

1382
01:40:09.639 --> 01:40:13.807
Well it's
the end of the term and all the kids come


1383
01:40:13.831 --> 01:40:15.791
and their folks too.

1384
01:40:15.815 --> 01:40:18.756
Well it's a special thing.

1385
01:40:20.359 --> 01:40:23.663
In the chapel, 
I suppose, with a sermon?

1386
01:40:23.687 --> 01:40:27.407
Yeah, but that's not so bad. Honest.

1387
01:40:27.431 --> 01:40:30.480
The other guys, their parents are coming.

1388
01:40:30.504 --> 01:40:34.121
They'll think I'm some kind of an orphan.

1389
01:40:35.048 --> 01:40:38.128
OK, Danny. I'll come.

1390
01:40:38.152 --> 01:40:41.105
You will? Man, will that be cool!

1391
01:40:41.129 --> 01:40:45.444
I mean, when you walk in
and all the guys see how pretty you are...


1392
01:41:46.699 --> 01:41:49.907
Such improvement calls for a new program

1393
01:41:49.931 --> 01:41:54.279
and new programs
are best instituted under new leadership.


1394
01:41:54.956 --> 01:41:58.772
In announcing to you
my resignation as headmaster of San Simeon


1395
01:41:58.796 --> 01:42:02.227
I'm filled with sadness
to contemplate the end of a long


1396
01:42:02.251 --> 01:42:05.487
and significant period of my life

1397
01:42:05.740 --> 01:42:09.364
yet a sadness commingled with joy

1398
01:42:09.388 --> 01:42:11.509
as I look forward
to the beginning of a new life


1399
01:42:11.533 --> 01:42:14.677
which I hope, as
indeed do not we all

1400
01:42:14.701 --> 01:42:17.558
may be more meaningful
to myself and to others

1401
01:42:17.582 --> 01:42:21.417
than the old, which today approaches its end.

1402
01:42:22.734 --> 01:42:27.254
Thinking back, I discover
that I've learned immensely more at San Simeon


1403
01:42:27.278 --> 01:42:29.462
than I have taught:

1404
01:42:29.486 --> 01:42:33.735
humility and pride, innocence and aspiration

1405
01:42:33.742 --> 01:42:36.246
perseverance and faith

1406
01:42:36.270 --> 01:42:39.309
and reverence

1407
01:42:39.535 --> 01:42:42.967
reverence
for life, no matter what form it takes


1408
01:42:42.991 --> 01:42:45.751
reverence
also for the needs of each individual


1409
01:42:45.775 --> 01:42:49.047
and his right to move
as swiftly along the path of enlightenment


1410
01:42:49.071 --> 01:42:51.607
as his ability permits.

1411
01:42:51.631 --> 01:42:57.103
I've learned not only
from students but from their parents also.


1412
01:42:57.424 --> 01:42:59.575
I've had the privilege of warming myself

1413
01:42:59.599 --> 01:43:02.583
before the hearth
of a generation younger than my own


1414
01:43:02.607 --> 01:43:05.745
holding ideas newer than my own

1415
01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:07.768
and different

1416
01:43:07.792 --> 01:43:12.205
and perhaps to some of us still strange.

1417
01:43:13.777 --> 01:43:16.793
I've learned that total adjustment to society

1418
01:43:16.817 --> 01:43:19.578
is quite as bad as total maladjustment

1419
01:43:19.602 --> 01:43:23.322
that principled
disobedience of unjust law is more Christian


1420
01:43:23.346 --> 01:43:28.025
more truly
law-abiding than unprincipled respect


1421
01:43:28.049 --> 01:43:31.917
that only freedom can tame the wild, rebellious

1422
01:43:32.466 --> 01:43:35.253
palpitating heart of man

1423
01:43:35.570 --> 01:43:37.850
encagement, never

1424
01:43:37.874 --> 01:43:42.353
that life, unfettered, moves towards life

1425
01:43:42.835 --> 01:43:47.031
and love to love

1426
01:43:48.723 --> 01:43:51.867
that in the full blaze
of God's cleansing sunlight


1427
01:43:51.891 --> 01:43:55.127
men and women are purely innocent

1428
01:43:55.156 --> 01:43:59.187
and therefore, most purely

1429
01:44:00.083 --> 01:44:02.227
beautiful.

1430
01:44:05.267 --> 01:44:09.436
There is another
for whom feelings flow too deep for gratitude


1431
01:44:09.460 --> 01:44:12.028
too wide for the heart's long explanation

1432
01:44:12.052 --> 01:44:15.735
too swiftly, perhaps, even for forgiveness

1433
01:44:16.148 --> 01:44:19.069
who led to the dreaming of brave dreams

1434
01:44:19.093 --> 01:44:24.149
who held eternally high
the chalice of youth and its hot, young hopes


1435
01:44:24.340 --> 01:44:29.998
gave living proof
that thinking and therefore being


1436
01:44:31.093 --> 01:44:34.328
is but a form of prayer.

1437
01:44:37.397 --> 01:44:41.340
What does one say
when confronted with such bounties?


1438
01:44:41.364 --> 01:44:44.574
One thanks God and remembers.

1439
01:44:44.598 --> 01:44:47.613
So it is, that I thank
him now for all of you.

1440
01:44:47.637 --> 01:44:52.366
I thank him, and in
whatever place to which his hand may lead us


1441
01:44:53.238 --> 01:44:55.699
I will remember

1442
01:44:56.950 --> 01:45:00.916
I will remember always.

1443
01:45:04.278 --> 01:45:06.226
Amen.

1444
01:45:48.985 --> 01:45:51.361
Please Mother, 
I've got to get them.

1445
01:45:51.385 --> 01:45:55.515
My dorm's right over there.
It'll only take a minute.


1446
01:45:55.834 --> 01:45:58.049
All right, Danny, but please hurry.

1447
01:45:58.073 --> 01:46:01.275
- I want to get out of here.
- OK


1448
01:46:25.626 --> 01:46:28.706
- Did you make these specially for me?
- Of course, Mr. Hendricks. Just for you.


1449
01:46:28.730 --> 01:46:32.119
Oh heavens! I never touch the stuff.

1450
01:46:32.155 --> 01:46:34.211
Well Edward,
you really pulled the rug out from under me.


1451
01:46:34.235 --> 01:46:37.218
If I had known you were leaving,
I'd have never gone for the scholarship fund.


1452
01:46:37.242 --> 01:46:39.586
Well clergy
have always been noted for their guile.


1453
01:46:39.610 --> 01:46:41.602
Well what are we supposed to do?

1454
01:46:41.626 --> 01:46:44.132
I mean, he's irreplaceable.

1455
01:46:44.156 --> 01:46:47.813
Not at all.
My successor is at this moment on the campus.


1456
01:46:47.837 --> 01:46:50.244
He's mighty young.

1457
01:46:50.268 --> 01:46:52.574
And so was I.

1458
01:46:53.148 --> 01:46:55.325
Excuse me.

1459
01:47:19.325 --> 01:47:22.713
- When are you leaving?
- In a few days.


1460
01:47:23.710 --> 01:47:25.606
I may drive down the coast.

1461
01:47:25.630 --> 01:47:29.530
Perhaps to Baja California.

1462
01:47:32.190 --> 01:47:34.552
Probably alone.

1463
01:47:35.326 --> 01:47:38.593
My wife hasn't any definite plans.

1464
01:47:40.094 --> 01:47:42.653
And after the trip?

1465
01:47:43.391 --> 01:47:46.811
I don't know. I have no plans, really.

1466
01:47:47.551 --> 01:47:49.628
And you?

1467
01:47:52.062 --> 01:47:54.456
I'll stay here.

1468
01:47:55.615 --> 01:47:59.232
Danny wants to go
to San Simeon next term.

1469
01:47:59.327 --> 01:48:01.415
I don't know about the financial situation.

1470
01:48:01.439 --> 01:48:05.917
It's all arranged. 
His scholarship too

1471
01:48:06.335 --> 01:48:08.315
everything.

1472
01:48:11.167 --> 01:48:13.344
Thank you.

1473
01:48:22.529 --> 01:48:24.607
Goodbye.

1474
01:48:40.257 --> 01:48:43.978
I'll write you from La Paz.

1475
01:48:44.002 --> 01:48:47.619
- And write the boys too.
- Yes of course.


1476
01:48:48.162 --> 01:48:49.962
Well perhaps in September...

1477
01:48:49.986 --> 01:48:53.187
I can't promise by September.

1478
01:48:54.658 --> 01:48:57.898
I've got to think my way back through

1479
01:48:57.922 --> 01:49:00.383
almost 21 years.

1480
01:49:00.994 --> 01:49:05.538
I really don't know, Edward.
We'll just have to wait and see.


1481
01:49:05.858 --> 01:49:07.774
Yes

1482
01:49:15.075 --> 01:49:18.244
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Edward.


1483
01:49:26.179 --> 01:49:29.323
- Five-to-one, you get the appointment.
- Thanks to you.


1484
01:49:29.347 --> 01:49:33.925
No, thanks to
Judge Thompson. He'll be in your corner.


1485
01:49:34.532 --> 01:49:37.058
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.


1486
01:49:37.123 --> 01:49:39.300
God bless

1487
01:49:42.245 --> 01:49:44.609
and Godspeed.
