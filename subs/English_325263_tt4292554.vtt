1
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.772
We are the
species that explores,


2
00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.777
that fashions vessels
to carry us into the unknown.


3
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.057
We sailed
the planet of our birth,


4
00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:08.577
saw its wonders
and made it home.


5
00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.891
And it wasn't enough.

6
00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.416
We built flying machines

7
00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.098
to explore higher,
faster, farther.


8
00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.936
Heroes flew them beyond
what once seemed possible.


9
00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.012
And it wasn't enough.

10
00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.654
In time,
we created special craft


11
00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:36.418
that would ferry us
to the edge of space and back.


12
00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.572
And as always,
there were the few...


13
00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:43.936
Brave and brilliant souls...

14
00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.810
Ready to guide this vessel
through dangers


15
00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.496
in the name of discovery.

16
00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.017
Using the space shuttle,

17
00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.374
we built an unprecedented
outpost in the heavens.


18
00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.058
We learned
in the weightless world


19
00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.019
of the International
Space Station,


20
00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.061
peered into the dark night
of an infinite universe.


21
00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.212
And it wasn't enough.

22
00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.975
Now we are
fashioning vessels to set off


23
00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.020
on our greatest adventure
of exploration ever:


24
00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.491
to Mars and beyond.

25
00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.018
Who knew that 30 years
would go by so quickly?


26
00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.019
That these unique spacecraft

27
00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:21.330
would leave in their wake

28
00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.219
a public captivated

29
00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:24.496
by their achievements...

30
00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.695
a planet poised at the brink

31
00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:34.979
of deep-space exploration.

32
00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.971
As an astronaut,
I definitely felt


33
00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:14.496
I was saying good-bye
to a long-time friend


34
00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:16.140
when the last shuttle landed.

35
00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.096
My name is Chris Ferguson.

36
00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:39.650
I was lucky enough to fly
on three shuttle missions,


37
00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:41.619
one of them on Endeavour.

38
00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:43.658
So it's no surprise
that I wanted to be there


39
00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.171
when she was headed
for her new home


40
00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:49.538
at the California Science Center
in Los Angeles.


41
00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.012
From the look of it,
you might think it took


42
00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:55.774
as much engineering
to get Endeavour


43
00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:58.854
through the streets of L.A.
as launching her into orbit.


44
00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:20.295
Watching the orbiter squeeze
through the city neighborhoods,


45
00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.692
you could feel just how much the
shuttle had come to stand for,


46
00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:26.893
almost as if it had taken
all of us into space.


47
00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:38.653
I sure don't want
the world to forget


48
00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:40.772
this remarkable spacecraft
and those who built it,


49
00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:43.496
and the legacy they left,

50
00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:46.301
lighting the way toward
our next frontier in space.


51
00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:49.820
They're coming.

52
00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:51.415
The shuttle was the first

53
00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:53.731
reusable piloted spacecraft.

54
00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:57.372
And its engineering and software
was so bulletproof,


55
00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:59.214
it could be flown by computers

56
00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:00.940
less powerful than
today's smartphones.


57
00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:02.979
Two hundred.

58
00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:06.091
One hundred.

59
00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:08.172
At 235 miles per hour,

60
00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:11.380
the shuttle had
the fastest touchdown speed


61
00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:14.932
of any flying vehicle
ever built.


62
00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:18.412
When you glide

63
00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:23.013
to a no-power landing, the gear
hits with a major whomp.


64
00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:25.370
Touchdown.

65
00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:31.936
Conceived in the 1970s

66
00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:34.138
as a kind of
winged delivery truck


67
00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:37.737
to build a United States
low-Earth-orbit space station...


68
00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:39.620
Give you
a payload l.D. of one.


69
00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:41.294
The shuttle actually flew

70
00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:44.499
more than a decade beyond
original expectations.


71
00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:50.131
It was the shuttle program
that allowed us to do


72
00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:53.374
real ongoing work in space,

73
00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:56.420
to put delicate equipment
into orbit and to retrieve


74
00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:58.652
and fix that equipment
when things went wrong.


75
00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:33.698
<i>(B)'</i>

76
00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:54.536
Orbiters deployed,
retrieved and repaired


77
00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:57.614
over a hundred scientific
and communications satellites.


78
00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:02.175
And no missions were more
important to our understanding


79
00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:05.811
of deep space than the
five flights, beginning in 1993,


80
00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:08.934
made to repair and upgrade
the Hubble Space Telescope.


81
00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:14.015
Hubble affirmative.

82
00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:16.218
You have a go for release.

83
00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:27.291
I think history will
view the Hubble Space Telescope


84
00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:30.095
as one of the crowning
achievements in astronomy.


85
00:08:36.410 --> 00:08:38.651
The Hubble gave us
an unprecedented view


86
00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:40.732
of both our closest neighbors

87
00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:44.810
and of galaxies
unimaginably far from our own.


88
00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:54.412
Further space telescope
investigations have revealed


89
00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:56.333
that the number
of Earth-like planets


90
00:08:56.410 --> 00:08:58.572
capable of harboring
liquid water


91
00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:01.814
is vastly greater than
scientists once calculated.


92
00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:44.741
In 1995, the shuttles began

93
00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:47.620
a new era of
international space exploration


94
00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:49.613
when Atlantis docked,
for the first time,


95
00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:51.613
with the Russian MIR station.

96
00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:53.932
Eight inches.

97
00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:56.411
One-oh-point-oh-seven.

98
00:09:56.490 --> 00:09:58.094
One-oh-six.

99
00:09:58.170 --> 00:09:59.979
Four inches.

100
00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:03.179
Now. We have capture.

101
00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:09.661
Altogether,

102
00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:11.971
the orbiters made

103
00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:14.257
These missions
established a level


104
00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:16.936
of international cooperation
and expertise


105
00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:19.012
that continues to this day.

106
00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:23.934
Though MIR
no longer orbits Earth,


107
00:10:24.010 --> 00:10:27.173
the shuttle proved itself
as a brilliant reusable tool


108
00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:30.697
that allowed us to live,
build and do science


109
00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:32.772
in the weightless environment
of space.


110
00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:00.972
But the shuttles' truest legacy

111
00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:03.576
crosses the sky above us
every 90 minutes.


112
00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:09.773
The International Space Station
could never have been built


113
00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:12.501
without the shuttles' payload
and space-walk capabilities.


114
00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:20.052
Space shuttles and Russian
Soyuz and Proton rockets


115
00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:21.700
made more than 40 flights

116
00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:23.610
to construct the International
Space Station...


117
00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:25.892
A true engineering miracle.

118
00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:34.256
All three of my Orbiter missions
were to the ISS.


119
00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:44.298
Modules built
by NASA partners in Asia,


120
00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:47.453
Europe and North America,
came together above Earth,


121
00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:49.453
over a period of 13 years,

122
00:11:49.570 --> 00:11:51.811
to create a floating world

123
00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:53.813
longer than a football field

124
00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:56.973
and with more living space
than a six-bedroom house.


125
00:12:00.890 --> 00:12:03.973
A typical ISS mission
requires an astronaut


126
00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:06.178
to live six months on board.

127
00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:09.140
But some crew members
will spend a year


128
00:12:09.210 --> 00:12:12.180
learning even more
about the very real physical


129
00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:14.571
and psychological stresses

130
00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:17.381
of long-term separation
from Earth.


131
00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:22.981
These missions
and the 15 nations


132
00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:25.940
that designed,
built and crew the ISS,


133
00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:28.331
forever changed
space exploration


134
00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:30.811
into a cooperative
international program


135
00:12:30.890 --> 00:12:34.133
and made a true home

140
00:12:45.770 --> 00:12:48.501
have spawned a multitude
of Earth-useful discoveries,

00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:49.776
including breakthroughs

142

in water purification
and robotic microsurgery.


143
00:12:53.570 --> 00:12:56.016
But most important,

144
00:12:56.090 --> 00:12:57.854
the ISS is our springboard
to the future,


145
00:12:57.970 --> 00:13:00.371
giving us the knowledge
and confidence

355 people rode the shuttle
into history.

00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:47.173
They circled the Earth

163
00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:50.254
and it all came
to seem routine...


164
00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:51.900
until it wasn't.

165
00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:53.256
One minute, 15 seconds.

166
00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:54.900
Velocity 2,900 feet per second.

167
00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:56.256
Altitude nine nautical miles.

168
00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:58.332
Downrange distance
seven nautical miles.


169
00:13:58.410 --> 00:13:59.900
This shuttle mission
will launch...


170
00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:01.620
My God!

171
00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:03.613
There's been an explosion.

172
00:14:03.690 --> 00:14:04.851
Flight controllers here

173
00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:07.740
looking very carefully
at the situation.


174
00:14:07.810 --> 00:14:09.778
Obviously a major malfunction.

175
00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:13.252
In two accidents
that stunned the world,


176
00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:15.458
we lost 14 astronauts.

177
00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:19.057
It was a sobering reminder
that every space flight


178
00:14:19.130 --> 00:14:22.532
is charged
with potential danger.


179
00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:24.897
They had a hunger
to explore the universe


180
00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:26.540
and discover its truths.

181
00:14:26.610 --> 00:14:28.897
They wished to serve,
and they did.


182
00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:33.621
They were pioneers.

183
00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:36.819
The future doesn't belong
to the fainthearted.


184
00:14:36.890 --> 00:14:39.131
It belongs to the brave.

185
00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:47.893
The world mourned,
but pushed on,


186
00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:50.814
because the accomplishments
of the space shuttle


187
00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:52.654
and the International
Space Station


188
00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:56.416
were full
of life-changing promise.


189
00:14:56.490 --> 00:14:59.937
In memory of our lost heroes,
the global space community


190
00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:04.214
pulled together to reignite
the future of both programs.


191
00:15:06.210 --> 00:15:08.941
Who could ask
for a better ending to my career


192
00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:10.978
as an astronaut
than getting to fly


193
00:15:11.050 --> 00:15:12.700
the last shuttle mission
on Atlantis,


194
00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:15.853
and a final visit to the ISS.

195
00:15:22.090 --> 00:15:25.378
Atlantis launch director,
air to ground one.


196
00:15:25.450 --> 00:15:27.259
Atlantis go.

197
00:15:27.370 --> 00:15:30.977
And so, for the final time,
Fergie, Doug,


198
00:15:31.050 --> 00:15:33.018
Sandy and Rex,
good luck, Godspeed,


199
00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:35.013
and have a little fun up there.

200
00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:37.457
We're not
ending the journey today, Mike,


201
00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:40.340
we're completing a chapter of
a journey that will never end.


202
00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:41.890
You and the thousands
of men and women


203
00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:44.012
who gave their hearts,
souls and their lives


204
00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:47.060
for the cause of exploration,
have rewritten history.


205
00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:49.371
Let's light this fire
one more time, Mike.


206
00:16:56.930 --> 00:16:59.297
Though the shuttles
no longer fly,


207
00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:01.611
I never miss a chance
to see Atlantis


208
00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:04.136
at the Kennedy Space Center.

209
00:17:06.970 --> 00:17:10.895
But I came to KSC to get a look
at the next big step


210
00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:15.339
in deep-space exploration,
and it's called Orion.


211
00:17:21.090 --> 00:17:24.412
Here, in the giant operations
and checkout clean room,


212
00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:26.931
the new Orion
multi-purposed crew vehicle


213
00:17:27.010 --> 00:17:28.739
is coming together.

214
00:17:28.810 --> 00:17:30.255
What an impressive vehicle.

215
00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:31.695
Look at that...
It's beautiful.


216
00:17:34.130 --> 00:17:36.895
It's gorgeous.
I'd love to climb in there.


217
00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:39.621
Orion is a true
deep-space exploration craft,


218
00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:42.011
designed to carry
astronauts of the future


219
00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:47.694
back to the moon,
to asteroids, and even to Mars.


220
00:17:53.170 --> 00:17:55.298
I've always
been drawn to explore


221
00:17:55.370 --> 00:17:56.974
and try new experiences.

222
00:17:57.050 --> 00:17:59.940
Maybe that's why I applied
to be an astronaut.


223
00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:01.296
I'm Serena Aunon,

224
00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:02.895
and I am one of
the newer group of astronauts


225
00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:04.734
chosen by NASA.

226
00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:13.971
Like the rest of my class,
I'm absolutely honored


227
00:18:14.050 --> 00:18:16.621
and humbled to be here, and it's
great to be a part of this team.


228
00:18:18.490 --> 00:18:20.811
I guess you could say I'm one

229
00:18:20.890 --> 00:18:23.655
of those people for whom
the future has always seemed


230
00:18:23.730 --> 00:18:25.778
an unfolding adventure.

231
00:18:25.850 --> 00:18:28.501
So you can go forward
and backwards in the procedure


232
00:18:28.570 --> 00:18:30.459
just by using
this toggle switch over here.


233
00:18:30.530 --> 00:18:31.816
Yes, that, exactly.

234
00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:33.455
Learning from astronauts,

235
00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:37.012
like Lee Morin, who have
already spent weeks in space,


236
00:18:37.090 --> 00:18:39.741
gives you a great sense
of confidence.


237
00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:45.174
The Orion mock-up
provides astronauts in training,


238
00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:48.015
like Serena, a chance
to learn flight procedures,


239
00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:50.980
and also give feedback
to perfect new systems.


240
00:18:51.050 --> 00:18:53.860
This should be a piece of cake
for Serena,


241
00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:55.694
since my shuttle's ten screens

242
00:18:55.770 --> 00:18:57.374
and more than
a thousand switches


243
00:18:57.450 --> 00:18:59.532
have been streamlined
to just three screens


244
00:18:59.610 --> 00:19:02.295
and 60 switches on Orion.

245
00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:05.135
Hey, Lee, you can open
the helium cross-feed valve.


246
00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:07.531
Okay, we got that, so go
ahead and send that command


247
00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:08.691
on the helium
cross-feed valve.


248
00:19:08.770 --> 00:19:09.851
All right, copy that.

249
00:19:09.930 --> 00:19:11.295
And the shuttle's hundred pounds

250
00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:14.897
of flight manuals and checklists
have been reduced to...


251
00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:18.213
well... zero, since Orion's
are all on computer.


252
00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:19.894
Stand by, and we'll evaluate.

253
00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:22.018
But even
with all these improvements,


254
00:19:22.090 --> 00:19:24.218
to get Orion into deep space,

255
00:19:24.290 --> 00:19:26.975
we're gonna need
a bigger rocket.


256
00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:32.693
When NASA's
giant space launch system,


257
00:19:32.770 --> 00:19:34.738
built by Boeing, is complete,

258
00:19:34.810 --> 00:19:38.417
the rocket will stand
as tall as a 38-story building


259
00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:41.858
and make more than
nine million pounds of thrust,


260
00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:45.571
enough to lift <i>22</i> elephants
into space.


261
00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:48.898
For deep-space expeditions,

262
00:19:48.970 --> 00:19:52.258
the SLS will need to lift
five key mission components


263
00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:54.458
beyond low
-Earth orbit.

264
00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:57.538
Since Orion is too cramped

265
00:19:57.610 --> 00:19:59.578
for a six-month journey to Mars,

266
00:19:59.650 --> 00:20:03.211
one solution being developed
is an inflatable habitat


267
00:20:03.290 --> 00:20:06.021
to house the crew en route.

268
00:20:08.170 --> 00:20:11.094
A solar electric
propulsion device will provide


269
00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:13.696
continuous power
for the round-trip journey.


270
00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:19.932
A lander craft will carry the
crew from their orbit above Mars


271
00:20:20.010 --> 00:20:23.457
down to the planet's surface.

272
00:20:23.530 --> 00:20:24.895
Months later, an ascent vehicle

273
00:20:24.970 --> 00:20:28.053
will lift the crew back up
to the orbiting Orion


274
00:20:28.170 --> 00:20:30.855
for the return trip to Earth.

275
00:20:30.930 --> 00:20:34.616
But even using
the most sophisticated


276
00:20:34.690 --> 00:20:37.261
future spacecraft,
a two-and-a-half year


277
00:20:37.330 --> 00:20:38.980
round-trip journey to Mars

278
00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:42.452
will present new challenges
to the human body.


279
00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:45.136
I wanted to thank the Indiana
State Museum for having me here.


280
00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:47.258
It is an absolute pleasure.

281
00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:50.459
As a medical doctor with a
specialty in aerospace medicine,


282
00:20:50.530 --> 00:20:53.579
I am particularly interested
in keeping astronauts healthy


283
00:20:53.650 --> 00:20:57.416
as we head into deep space
for long periods of time.


284
00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:02.974
Our experience with more
extended weightlessness


285
00:21:03.050 --> 00:21:06.896
on the ISS has shown us that the
human body will face challenges


286
00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:10.213
during lengthy journeys
to deep space.


287
00:21:11.690 --> 00:21:14.500
Key issues are muscle
and bone loss,


288
00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:17.733
which can start after just
a few days of weightlessness,


289
00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:21.496
along with degrading
of vision for some astronauts.


290
00:21:21.570 --> 00:21:24.460
We now know that exercise
is the antidote


291
00:21:24.530 --> 00:21:27.500
for most problems
caused by weightlessness.


292
00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:29.572
And I mean exercise...

293
00:21:29.690 --> 00:21:31.692
About two hours a day.

294
00:21:33.170 --> 00:21:35.457
But, even so,
the first explorers to Mars


295
00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:37.459
will need to rest
at least a few days


296
00:21:37.530 --> 00:21:40.261
after landing on the planet
to readjust to walking,


297
00:21:40.330 --> 00:21:43.618
though Mars has less than

298
00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:49.535
Radiation is another risk
in deep space.


299
00:21:54.850 --> 00:21:57.057
Radiation from
our sun's solar storms


300
00:21:57.130 --> 00:21:58.700
is one source of danger.

301
00:22:01.930 --> 00:22:05.491
But cosmic radiation, which
permeates all of deep space,


302
00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:08.460
is another ever-present
challenge to human health.


303
00:22:10.610 --> 00:22:14.012
Sections of Orion,
as well as the transit habitat,


304
00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:15.216
will have to serve as a shelter

305
00:22:15.290 --> 00:22:17.657
in the case of a major
solar flare.


306
00:22:24.210 --> 00:22:25.416
In the Arizona desert,

307
00:22:25.490 --> 00:22:28.539
an Orion mock-up
is being drop-tested


308
00:22:28.610 --> 00:22:31.295
to evaluate reentry systems.

309
00:22:35.170 --> 00:22:36.410
On returning from deep space,

310
00:22:36.490 --> 00:22:37.821
Orion will enter our atmosphere

311
00:22:37.890 --> 00:22:40.939
more than 50% faster

312
00:22:41.010 --> 00:22:43.490
than shuttles or Soyuz capsules,

313
00:22:43.570 --> 00:22:46.221
and generate
five times more heat,


314
00:22:46.290 --> 00:22:49.260
so perfecting
her parachute deployment


315
00:22:49.330 --> 00:22:52.174
and heat shield
is key to crew survival.


316
00:22:57.810 --> 00:23:00.336
At the Kennedy Space Center,
Orion is being prepped


317
00:23:00.410 --> 00:23:04.460
for an uncrewed
test flight into deep space.


318
00:23:04.530 --> 00:23:08.854
This new vessel marks
the first step in over 40 years


319
00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:13.015
to put humans beyond
low Earth orbit.


320
00:23:15.690 --> 00:23:18.375
A journey to Mars
is on the horizon


321
00:23:18.450 --> 00:23:21.260
because of wide-ranging
international efforts


322
00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:24.300
by both governments
and private enterprise.


323
00:23:24.370 --> 00:23:27.135
Companies from Boeing
and Lockheed


324
00:23:27.210 --> 00:23:30.259
to newcomers like
SpaceX, Sierra Nevada


325
00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:32.253
and Orbital Sciences

326
00:23:32.330 --> 00:23:33.820
are developing spacecraft

327
00:23:33.890 --> 00:23:36.814
to service the ISS and beyond.

328
00:23:38.290 --> 00:23:41.260
Some private groups
foresee a technically simpler


329
00:23:41.330 --> 00:23:44.812
one-way mission
to colonize Mars.


330
00:23:44.890 --> 00:23:47.211
Already thousands
have volunteered


331
00:23:47.290 --> 00:23:49.975
to live permanently
on the Red Planet.


332
00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:55.178
The demands of going
to deep space


333
00:23:55.250 --> 00:23:58.174
will push old designs
to new limits.


334
00:23:58.250 --> 00:24:01.413
- Looks good.
- Looks good. Hey.


335
00:24:01.490 --> 00:24:03.333
- New glove. Should be good.
- Sounds good.


336
00:24:03.410 --> 00:24:04.821
My name is Lindsey Aitchison

337
00:24:04.930 --> 00:24:07.171
and I am a spacesuit
project engineer


338
00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:09.617
at NASA Johnson Space Center.

339
00:24:09.690 --> 00:24:12.261
I first started thinking
about space flight


340
00:24:12.330 --> 00:24:14.981
when I was four years old,
when I first came to JSC


341
00:24:15.050 --> 00:24:18.497
to take a tour
at the visitor's center.


342
00:24:18.610 --> 00:24:20.891
We have pictures of me just
sitting inside this spacesuit,


343
00:24:20.930 --> 00:24:23.171
and I just knew
that's what I wanted to do.


344
00:24:28.450 --> 00:24:31.374
No, dad-gum it.

345
00:24:31.450 --> 00:24:33.657
When the Apollo suits
were first done,


346
00:24:33.730 --> 00:24:35.812
those were very
short-duration EVAs.


347
00:24:35.890 --> 00:24:38.336
We didn't have a lot
of mobility in that suit,


348
00:24:38.410 --> 00:24:40.458
so when you see
those astronauts hopping around


349
00:24:40.530 --> 00:24:43.340
on the lunar surface,
it's not because they themselves


350
00:24:43.410 --> 00:24:46.857
are clumsy or that the gravity
is just impossible to deal with.


351
00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:49.211
We didn't give them enough
mobility in the suits.


352
00:24:49.290 --> 00:24:50.974
So we learned a lot from that.

353
00:24:54.410 --> 00:24:56.333
For the next generation suit,

354
00:24:56.410 --> 00:24:58.731
there's still a lot
that we don't know


355
00:24:58.810 --> 00:25:00.892
about what it's going
to be like to live


356
00:25:00.970 --> 00:25:02.972
and work on Mars every day.

357
00:25:04.570 --> 00:25:07.141
Once there, you'd be doing EVA,

358
00:25:07.210 --> 00:25:09.258
walking outside on the planet
about every other day.


359
00:25:16.290 --> 00:25:18.975
Once we have the hardware
in-house, we become the experts


360
00:25:19.050 --> 00:25:21.894
of how that hardware works,
what it does,


361
00:25:21.970 --> 00:25:23.574
and how it meets the needs

362
00:25:23.650 --> 00:25:26.494
for our next phase
of our mission design.


363
00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:40.856
We actually get into the suits,
because the best way


364
00:25:40.930 --> 00:25:42.853
to understand how
a spacesuit moves


365
00:25:42.930 --> 00:25:45.331
is to be inside of it
and work it yourself.


366
00:25:48.330 --> 00:25:51.140
I'll be asking Richard
to perform specific tasks.


367
00:25:51.210 --> 00:25:54.817
What is his gait like?

368
00:25:54.890 --> 00:25:57.655
And so I'm watching how
the bearings in the hip move


369
00:25:57.730 --> 00:26:00.256
and how the bearings
in the waist move.


370
00:26:00.330 --> 00:26:03.174
And by comparing natural body
motion to suited body motion


371
00:26:03.250 --> 00:26:05.298
we can start to tweak
the design of the suit


372
00:26:05.370 --> 00:26:07.293
to make it more natural.

373
00:26:07.370 --> 00:26:10.294
So that's what we're
focusing on for exploration...


374
00:26:10.370 --> 00:26:13.021
Is how do you walk, how do you
bend, how do you kneel,


375
00:26:13.090 --> 00:26:15.741
how do you do all
those geology-type tasks?


376
00:26:33.210 --> 00:26:35.178
So, one of the big problems
they had in Apollo


377
00:26:35.250 --> 00:26:37.856
was all of that dust
on the lunar surface.


378
00:26:37.930 --> 00:26:39.694
It stuck to everything.

379
00:26:39.770 --> 00:26:41.977
When the guys would come back
inside of the lunar module


380
00:26:42.050 --> 00:26:44.291
at the end of their EVAs,
taking off their suits,


381
00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:47.135
there was dirt everywhere...
There was dirt on themselves.


382
00:26:47.210 --> 00:26:49.212
It was just gross, right?

383
00:26:56.370 --> 00:26:58.498
And that dirt is actually pretty
harmful... the lunar dirt...


384
00:26:58.570 --> 00:27:00.732
Specifically, to breathe in
for long periods of time,


385
00:27:00.810 --> 00:27:02.733
so, long-duration missions,
we wouldn't want to


386
00:27:02.810 --> 00:27:05.131
bring that dirt inside
with us all the time.


387
00:27:11.810 --> 00:27:13.300
All right, Richard.
Nice job.


388
00:27:13.410 --> 00:27:15.572
Time to come on in.

389
00:27:15.650 --> 00:27:17.891
So one of the key
concepts we're looking at


390
00:27:17.970 --> 00:27:19.893
for lunar and even
Martian missions


391
00:27:19.970 --> 00:27:22.655
is using what we call
a suit port.


392
00:27:27.650 --> 00:27:30.699
The idea of a suit port
is that you have this plate


393
00:27:30.770 --> 00:27:33.535
that becomes your pressure seal
between the vehicle


394
00:27:33.610 --> 00:27:36.011
and your suit, so when
you're not using the suit,


395
00:27:36.090 --> 00:27:37.854
it stays outside
the entire time.


396
00:27:37.930 --> 00:27:39.420
It is physically attached
to the vehicle


397
00:27:39.490 --> 00:27:42.061
so you can come in and out
of your space suit


398
00:27:42.130 --> 00:27:44.337
without ever
having to physically


399
00:27:44.410 --> 00:27:47.619
go into an air lock
like we do today.


400
00:27:47.690 --> 00:27:49.370
Welcome home, Richard.
How'd the suit feel?


401
00:27:49.410 --> 00:27:51.060
Feels good.

402
00:27:51.130 --> 00:27:53.132
Outstanding.
Strong work out there.


403
00:27:57.850 --> 00:28:00.933
Driving a space
exploration vehicle on dry land


404
00:28:01.010 --> 00:28:04.219
is great training for deep-space
missions of the future.


405
00:28:08.690 --> 00:28:12.217
But driving a mini-sub
was even more exacting.


406
00:28:28.730 --> 00:28:31.461
No, there are no
liquid oceans on Mars,


407
00:28:31.570 --> 00:28:34.050
but before setting out
for the Red Planet,


408
00:28:34.130 --> 00:28:38.021
astronauts may make test
missions to nearby asteroids.


409
00:28:40.890 --> 00:28:43.336
A mini-sub resembles
the kind of craft


410
00:28:43.410 --> 00:28:45.458
we will use
to explore asteroids,


411
00:28:45.530 --> 00:28:48.500
and the ocean matches
the zero gravity of space.


412
00:28:58.370 --> 00:29:01.340
This NEEMO 16 mission marks

413
00:29:01.410 --> 00:29:04.414
the 16th time NASA has trained
at the Aquarius lab,


414
00:29:04.490 --> 00:29:06.697
which is anchored

415
00:29:06.770 --> 00:29:08.772
off Key Largo in Florida.

416
00:29:24.690 --> 00:29:27.500
NASA aquanauts live in the lab
for up to two weeks


417
00:29:27.570 --> 00:29:29.572
without coming to the surface.

418
00:29:36.890 --> 00:29:39.291
This allows us to work
the entire day


419
00:29:39.370 --> 00:29:41.372
and only decompress once

420
00:29:41.450 --> 00:29:43.452
at the end of the mission.

421
00:29:48.130 --> 00:29:51.293
Any mistakes here
can have real consequences,


422
00:29:51.370 --> 00:29:54.579
exactly as in deep,
inhospitable space.


423
00:30:02.650 --> 00:30:05.574
Since asteroids appear
to have changed very little


424
00:30:05.650 --> 00:30:07.493
since they first formed,

425
00:30:07.570 --> 00:30:12.053
they could tell us a lot
about our early solar system.


426
00:30:18.730 --> 00:30:21.813
Ultimately, we may develop
space tools to capture


427
00:30:21.930 --> 00:30:26.174
and reposition a small asteroid
to orbit our moon.


428
00:30:28.410 --> 00:30:30.219
This would allow
for easier study,


429
00:30:30.290 --> 00:30:33.612
and also develop our ability
to deflect a larger asteroid


430
00:30:33.690 --> 00:30:36.011
that was on a collision course
with Earth.


431
00:31:00.330 --> 00:31:02.810
This Olympus inflatable habitat,

432
00:31:02.930 --> 00:31:05.410
designed by Bigelow Aerospace,

433
00:31:05.490 --> 00:31:08.414
is a look at the future
of living in space.


434
00:31:08.490 --> 00:31:10.572
Jay, this is amazing.
How big is that?


435
00:31:10.650 --> 00:31:12.414
Thanks.
Yeah, it's really big.


436
00:31:12.490 --> 00:31:15.334
It's about 2,250 cubic meters
interior volume, which is


437
00:31:15.410 --> 00:31:17.936
a little over twice the size of
the International Space Station.


438
00:31:18.010 --> 00:31:20.331
And it looks like it's, like,

439
00:31:20.410 --> 00:31:22.777
Yeah, it's probably 45 or 50.
It's really big.


440
00:31:22.850 --> 00:31:25.091
Once you get into space,
y-you just inflate it with air?


441
00:31:25.170 --> 00:31:27.093
Right, we bring up huge
compressed air tanks


442
00:31:27.170 --> 00:31:28.934
that bring up large
volumes of air.


443
00:31:29.010 --> 00:31:31.695
Um, this expands out so the
inside is about 16 meters


444
00:31:31.770 --> 00:31:34.376
in diameter, and the outside's
a lot bigger than that.


445
00:31:41.290 --> 00:31:43.770
It's surprising
that an inflatable habitat


446
00:31:43.850 --> 00:31:47.536
can protect its crew against
micrometeorites and radiation,


447
00:31:47.610 --> 00:31:50.295
but that's what tests
have shown.


448
00:31:51.330 --> 00:31:53.298
The immense volume of Olympus

449
00:31:53.370 --> 00:31:55.293
will provide ample work areas

450
00:31:55.370 --> 00:31:59.375
as well as living space
to help maintain crew morale.


451
00:32:02.050 --> 00:32:04.735
Supply craft
to provide food, fuel,


452
00:32:04.810 --> 00:32:08.417
and radiation-protective living
space will be landed on Mars


453
00:32:08.490 --> 00:32:12.256
well before the first human
expedition is launched.


454
00:32:12.330 --> 00:32:15.652
We don't know exactly what all
the spacecraft will look like,


455
00:32:15.730 --> 00:32:18.381
but concepts are under
active development.


456
00:32:20.850 --> 00:32:23.535
Our infatuation
with space exploration


457
00:32:23.610 --> 00:32:27.410
is as limitless as space itself.

458
00:32:28.450 --> 00:32:30.020
Without the shuttle,
there would be


459
00:32:30.090 --> 00:32:31.694
no International Space Station,

460
00:32:31.810 --> 00:32:36.179
the vital test bed for a future
human expedition to Mars.


461
00:32:36.250 --> 00:32:40.175
And that mission is closer
than you might imagine.


462
00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:44.699
NASA projects we will get
to Mars in the 2030s.


463
00:32:44.770 --> 00:32:46.852
In other words,
within the career


464
00:32:46.930 --> 00:32:49.979
of today's young astronauts.

465
00:32:50.050 --> 00:32:51.973
So any of these movies that you
see where people survive


466
00:32:52.050 --> 00:32:53.575
even for 20 seconds...

467
00:32:53.650 --> 00:32:55.379
Why go to Mars?

468
00:32:55.450 --> 00:32:58.897
Why not just send more and more
sophisticated robotic vehicles?


469
00:32:59.330 --> 00:33:01.901
I think to explore
beyond what is known


470
00:33:01.970 --> 00:33:05.213
is simply
at the core of our DNA.


471
00:33:05.290 --> 00:33:09.420
And only a human mission
can tell us definitively


472
00:33:09.490 --> 00:33:14.018
if we can survive and establish
future settlements on Mars.


473
00:33:25.690 --> 00:33:29.058
Astronauts exploring the planet
may notice


474
00:33:29.130 --> 00:33:31.371
and learn things
robots could not,


475
00:33:31.450 --> 00:33:33.418
things that could help take us

476
00:33:33.490 --> 00:33:35.538
to the next frontiers
beyond Mars.


477
00:33:43.690 --> 00:33:45.931
Every 26 months,
there is an optimal window


478
00:33:46.050 --> 00:33:48.860
for launching spacecraft
to Mars.


479
00:33:48.970 --> 00:33:52.292
But even using the planets'
orbits to shorten distance


480
00:33:52.370 --> 00:33:55.374
and increase speed, with
currently planned propulsion,


481
00:33:55.450 --> 00:33:59.136
the trip to and from Mars
will take six months...


482
00:33:59.210 --> 00:34:01.292
each way.

483
00:34:15.810 --> 00:34:19.576
Someday, even more exotic plasma
or fusion propulsion


484
00:34:19.650 --> 00:34:21.971
could shorten the journey.

485
00:34:22.050 --> 00:34:25.896
But the first explorers to Mars
will not have that luxury.


486
00:34:32.410 --> 00:34:35.812
Orion can transport up
to six passengers,


487
00:34:35.890 --> 00:34:37.858
but for a first trip to Mars,

488
00:34:37.930 --> 00:34:40.331
it would likely carry
no more than four.


489
00:34:43.410 --> 00:34:46.334
While going to and from
the Red Planet,


490
00:34:46.410 --> 00:34:48.811
Orion and the inflatable habitat

491
00:34:48.890 --> 00:34:51.939
will be the astronauts' life
support home for flight control,


492
00:34:52.010 --> 00:34:56.254
science, and that all-important
physical exercise.


493
00:35:17.130 --> 00:35:19.212
Going to Mars...

494
00:35:19.290 --> 00:35:22.055
Getting there, working there,
coming back...


495
00:35:22.130 --> 00:35:24.371
Will take nearly three years.

496
00:35:24.450 --> 00:35:26.578
I wonder how that will feel,

497
00:35:26.650 --> 00:35:31.292
to be away from home and friends
and family for so long.


498
00:35:49.610 --> 00:35:52.534
There is no 911 in space.

499
00:35:52.610 --> 00:35:56.376
When Orion nears Mars,
the spacecraft is two years away


500
00:35:56.450 --> 00:35:59.056
from any possibility
of help from Earth.


501
00:35:59.130 --> 00:36:02.259
Even radio communications
will take 40 minutes


502
00:36:02.330 --> 00:36:04.253
to send and receive,

503
00:36:04.330 --> 00:36:07.618
so any equipment failures
or other emergencies


504
00:36:07.690 --> 00:36:10.341
must be solved
by the crew alone.


505
00:36:16.770 --> 00:36:20.172
Nearly four decades
of robotic exploration on Mars


506
00:36:20.290 --> 00:36:23.294
has blazed a path
for humans to follow...


507
00:36:24.530 --> 00:36:27.340
craft like Pathfinder
and Curiosity.


508
00:36:29.170 --> 00:36:32.140
Maybe I'll get to kick the dust
off their tires.


509
00:37:23.570 --> 00:37:25.572
<i>(B)'</i>

510
00:37:33.410 --> 00:37:37.301
Though it will be incredibly
exciting to land on Mars,


511
00:37:37.370 --> 00:37:41.136
our ongoing training
in sophisticated simulator labs


512
00:37:41.210 --> 00:37:45.295
means it won't feel entirely
unfamiliar when we get there.


513
00:37:50.450 --> 00:37:54.375
Later explorers to Mars might
travel hundreds of kilometers


514
00:37:54.450 --> 00:37:57.056
to mine their own water
and hydrogen


515
00:37:57.130 --> 00:37:59.053
to make fuel
for their return to Earth.


516
00:37:59.690 --> 00:38:02.773
But first visitors
will have their hands full


517
00:38:02.890 --> 00:38:07.817
making the discoveries that only
a human mission can accomplish.


518
00:38:18.370 --> 00:38:22.136
I don't know if I'll ever get
to walk and work on Mars,


519
00:38:22.210 --> 00:38:25.373
but I may already know
some of those who will.


520
00:38:25.450 --> 00:38:27.373
Someone who dreams of it,

521
00:38:27.450 --> 00:38:29.817
just like me.

522
00:38:43.570 --> 00:38:47.939
Humankind has forever
been drawn toward the unknown,


523
00:38:48.010 --> 00:38:50.331
by the simple innate conviction

524
00:38:50.410 --> 00:38:53.698
that, to see the long-hidden
side of the mountain,


525
00:38:53.770 --> 00:38:58.173
to brush the infinite depth
of the sea, might reveal


526
00:38:58.250 --> 00:39:01.254
where we come from
and who we are.


527
00:39:03.930 --> 00:39:07.537
When humans do touch
and explore Mars,


528
00:39:07.610 --> 00:39:11.376
it will be among the greatest
achievements in history.


529
00:39:16.210 --> 00:39:19.771
But even that won't be enough.

530
00:39:19.850 --> 00:39:24.458
We are the species
that explores.


531
00:39:24.530 --> 00:39:26.897
We will fashion new vessels

532
00:39:26.970 --> 00:39:29.701
to carry us still deeper
into space,


533
00:39:29.810 --> 00:39:32.893
venturing
from our life-giving home


534
00:39:32.970 --> 00:39:35.894
to uncover the secrets
of the cosmos


535
00:39:35.970 --> 00:39:40.737
and our own
unimagined possibilities.
