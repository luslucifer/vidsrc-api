1
00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.789
- Patrick!
- Hi. How are you?


2
00:01:30.831 --> 00:01:31.748
Good.

3
00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.626
- Been a while.
- I know.


4
00:01:34.668 --> 00:01:39.673
It's been at least 12 years

5
00:01:39.715 --> 00:01:43.969
since I've seen anything
that we put away in storage.


6
00:01:44.011 --> 00:01:46.430
But they are all
personal artifacts


7
00:01:46.471 --> 00:01:48.515
from my dad's whole life.

8
00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.737
Oh, wow.

9
00:02:01.778 --> 00:02:03.113
Hey, Daddy.

10
00:02:03.155 --> 00:02:06.908
Most of these things
were in Buffalo, New York.


11
00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.996
And then a lot of stuff
was also in the house


12
00:02:11.038 --> 00:02:12.497
we had in Woodland Hills.

13
00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:15.792
- Oh, my God.
- Look how beautiful this is.


14
00:02:15.834 --> 00:02:19.171
This was hanging in the house
in Woodland Hills.


15
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.175
Is that Catherine Bach

16
00:02:23.216 --> 00:02:25.844
from, uh, Dukes of Hazzard?

17
00:02:25.886 --> 00:02:27.304
Probably so.

18
00:02:27.346 --> 00:02:30.015
I mean...

19
00:02:30.057 --> 00:02:33.143
Daddy had his share
of women, that's for sure.


20
00:02:33.185 --> 00:02:38.231
Oh, my gosh.

21
00:02:38.273 --> 00:02:42.569
This is OJ and his wife.

22
00:02:42.611 --> 00:02:44.863
- You know my dad.
- He speaks his mind.


23
00:02:44.905 --> 00:02:46.698
I don't know
if he had some insight,


24
00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.744
but he said,
"That motherfucker did it."


25
00:02:51.787 --> 00:02:54.915
I haven't been here
since my dad passed


26
00:02:54.956 --> 00:02:59.294
because I knew
it could be sort of emotional.


27
00:02:59.336 --> 00:03:01.380
This is his whole life.

28
00:03:01.421 --> 00:03:03.799
Oh, my gosh.

29
00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.426
Oh, man.

30
00:03:08.261 --> 00:03:11.223
We had some father/daughter

31
00:03:11.264 --> 00:03:13.392
chats right here.

32
00:03:13.433 --> 00:03:15.143
I love this piece.

33
00:03:16.728 --> 00:03:19.356
I miss you, Daddy.

34
00:03:19.398 --> 00:03:21.400
Sad news tonight
for Rick James fans.


35
00:03:21.441 --> 00:03:22.901
The funk singer best known

36
00:03:22.943 --> 00:03:25.153
for his hit song
"Super Freak" has died.


37
00:03:25.195 --> 00:03:26.863
He was in fragile health

38
00:03:26.905 --> 00:03:29.074
after a stroke
and years of drug use.


39
00:03:29.116 --> 00:03:30.742
It was in 1981 that James'

40
00:03:30.784 --> 00:03:32.744
million-seller album
Street Songs gave us


41
00:03:32.786 --> 00:03:35.122
the hits "Give It to Me Baby"
and "Super Freak."


42
00:03:35.163 --> 00:03:37.916
James earned a Grammy
nomination for that album.


43
00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:40.544
After that, though, James'
personal life was troubled.


44
00:03:40.585 --> 00:03:43.213
He was arrested several times
on drug charges, assault,


45
00:03:43.255 --> 00:03:45.549
and served time
in Folsom Prison.


46
00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.635
It didn't take his death for me
to start playing his music.


47
00:03:48.677 --> 00:03:49.928
It's been in my car.

48
00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.139
- It's been in my house.
- I'm... big fan.


49
00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.934
On behalf of the James family,

50
00:03:55.976 --> 00:04:00.105
we would like to thank
all of his fans.


51
00:04:01.606 --> 00:04:05.444
This is his moment of glory,

52
00:04:05.485 --> 00:04:08.572
and he would have loved to...

53
00:04:08.613 --> 00:04:12.367
know that he had
this much support,


54
00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:15.579
and we appreciate your prayers.

55
00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:16.747
Thank you.

56
00:04:18.832 --> 00:04:21.626
When I hit the stage,
I become Rick James.


57
00:04:21.668 --> 00:04:25.547
That character exemplifies
everything that it stands for:


58
00:04:25.589 --> 00:04:30.051
Freedom, sex,
love, power, truth.


59
00:04:30.093 --> 00:04:32.387
I couldn't be the same person
off the stage.


60
00:04:32.429 --> 00:04:35.891
If I was that way off
the stage, I'd be nuts by now.


61
00:04:35.932 --> 00:04:37.809
Rick James' "Super Freak".

62
00:04:37.851 --> 00:04:41.646
Rick James was the ultimate
"be yourself" artist.


63
00:04:45.025 --> 00:04:47.819
He was groundbreaking
and fearless.


64
00:04:47.861 --> 00:04:49.863
His music speaks for itself.

65
00:04:49.905 --> 00:04:52.824
It gets no more funkier
than Rick James.


66
00:04:52.866 --> 00:04:54.701
And he was just so raw.

67
00:04:54.743 --> 00:04:58.288
He became one of the guys
that a lot of men wanted to be


68
00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:59.664
and women wanted to be with.

69
00:04:59.706 --> 00:05:01.291
He had a certain magic

70
00:05:01.333 --> 00:05:03.585
in his style of production.

71
00:05:03.627 --> 00:05:05.170
His musical legacy
is undeniable.


72
00:05:05.212 --> 00:05:08.256
Rick's powerful
music really anchored itself


73
00:05:08.298 --> 00:05:11.009
to the evolution
of Black history in America.


74
00:05:11.051 --> 00:05:13.178
Rick put it to music,
and he put words to it.


75
00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.013
From the bottom to the top,

76
00:05:15.055 --> 00:05:17.808
from the top to the bottom,
he could relate to everybody


77
00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:19.518
because he had been
in every shoe.


78
00:05:19.559 --> 00:05:22.521
Musically, there weren't many
that could touch him.


79
00:05:22.562 --> 00:05:25.524
He was a real motherfucker.

80
00:05:28.401 --> 00:05:30.946
She's a super freak,
super freak.


81
00:05:30.987 --> 00:05:33.615
She's super freaky, yow!

82
00:05:34.741 --> 00:05:36.201
Everybody sing.

83
00:05:36.243 --> 00:05:40.038
Super freak, super freak...

84
00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.665
Never mind who you thought
I was.


85
00:05:41.706 --> 00:05:43.458
I'm Rick James, bitch.

86
00:05:51.508 --> 00:05:52.801
I used to have these dreams.

87
00:05:52.843 --> 00:05:54.278
I just knew that it was gonna
happen, you know,


88
00:05:54.302 --> 00:05:55.804
and I used to see it,
and my mother,


89
00:05:55.846 --> 00:05:57.764
consequently, would take me
to a psychiatrist,


90
00:05:57.806 --> 00:05:59.641
and the psychiatrist
would tell her,


91
00:05:59.683 --> 00:06:01.035
- "- Hey, he's real normal.
- He's above normal.


92
00:06:01.059 --> 00:06:02.602
He has a super high
intelligence,


93
00:06:02.644 --> 00:06:04.688
but the boy just...

94
00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:06.481
wants to be a star.

95
00:06:06.523 --> 00:06:08.108
And that is that."

96
00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:11.444
This is Buffalo,
the second-largest city


97
00:06:11.486 --> 00:06:13.113
in New York state.

98
00:06:13.154 --> 00:06:15.699
Strategically located at
the eastern end of Lake Erie,


99
00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:17.075
it early was given the title

100
00:06:17.117 --> 00:06:19.578
of the Queen City of the Lakes.

101
00:06:19.619 --> 00:06:21.371
Buffalo is a bustling community,

102
00:06:21.413 --> 00:06:23.874
and serves as the hub
of the Niagara frontier.


103
00:06:23.915 --> 00:06:25.750
Its dynamic development results

104
00:06:25.792 --> 00:06:28.003
from an unusual diversity
of industry.


105
00:06:31.131 --> 00:06:32.424
What's Buffalo like to you?

106
00:06:32.465 --> 00:06:33.425
What is Buffalo?

107
00:06:33.466 --> 00:06:35.093
It's basically a small town.

108
00:06:35.135 --> 00:06:37.095
It's a good place for music,
you know,


109
00:06:37.137 --> 00:06:38.597
'cause we have a lot
of music there.


110
00:06:38.638 --> 00:06:41.266
Nice hills and ghetto.

111
00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.770
Rats this big.

112
00:07:03.872 --> 00:07:05.457
Buffalo, to me,
is one of the most


113
00:07:05.498 --> 00:07:09.210
racially-segregated cities
in the country.


114
00:07:09.252 --> 00:07:11.171
Now we posted up
at the Chinese store.


115
00:07:11.212 --> 00:07:13.757
Hopin' somebody
would buy us a cigar.


116
00:07:13.798 --> 00:07:15.342
Then we evolved.

117
00:07:15.383 --> 00:07:16.986
To breakin' in houses
and stealin' cars...


118
00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:18.386
It's split up in sections,

119
00:07:18.428 --> 00:07:19.888
you know what I'm saying?

120
00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:21.690
Like, this the east side,
that's your ghetto.


121
00:07:21.723 --> 00:07:23.534
- You see the school.
- You see how this shit look?


122
00:07:23.558 --> 00:07:26.061
It's more Black kids and shit,
you know what I'm saying?


123
00:07:26.102 --> 00:07:28.229
And Black families
trying to figure it out.


124
00:07:28.271 --> 00:07:30.982
- The bottom, I call it.
- You got the west side.


125
00:07:31.024 --> 00:07:32.984
It's more, like,
you know, Hispanic...


126
00:07:33.026 --> 00:07:35.153
Like, Latinos and shit,
you know what I mean?


127
00:07:35.195 --> 00:07:37.280
Your Puerto Ricans and
Dominicans and shit like that,


128
00:07:37.322 --> 00:07:39.908
but it's also still
more cultural, too,


129
00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:42.327
because you got
your Middle Easterns


130
00:07:42.369 --> 00:07:43.930
and, you know,
you got some people... you know,


131
00:07:43.954 --> 00:07:46.164
you got people from all over,
really, on the west side,


132
00:07:46.206 --> 00:07:48.100
- you know what I'm saying?
- Then you got South Buffalo.


133
00:07:48.124 --> 00:07:50.001
That's, like, your poor whites.

134
00:07:50.043 --> 00:07:53.004
And then North Buffalo,
they're... you know,


135
00:07:53.046 --> 00:07:54.839
it's nice houses,
it's nice schools.


136
00:07:54.881 --> 00:07:56.716
You know, everybody is doing
well-well-off,


137
00:07:56.758 --> 00:07:58.301
so to speak, over there.

138
00:07:58.343 --> 00:08:00.011
Me, personally,
I stay on the east,


139
00:08:00.053 --> 00:08:01.638
where I belong,
you know what I mean?


140
00:08:06.267 --> 00:08:08.228
What's the local
legend of Rick James?


141
00:08:08.269 --> 00:08:10.772
OG Jimbo once had
our nigga Rick James


142
00:08:10.814 --> 00:08:12.899
to come through,
you know what I mean?


143
00:08:12.941 --> 00:08:15.652
- Caught him.
- Caught him getting right, man.


144
00:08:15.694 --> 00:08:19.406
Pulling up in the limo
with furs and shit on, though.


145
00:08:19.447 --> 00:08:20.991
Bitches and shit with him.

146
00:08:21.032 --> 00:08:24.327
Two, three cars deep and shit,
making a spot hot.


147
00:08:24.369 --> 00:08:26.204
Like, "Damn, nigga, you gonna...

148
00:08:26.246 --> 00:08:27.747
You gonna make my spot hot."

149
00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:30.458
He was just one of them dudes

150
00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:32.293
that you didn't want
to fuck with,


151
00:08:32.335 --> 00:08:33.878
you didn't want to mess with,

152
00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:35.380
who was known for definitely

153
00:08:35.422 --> 00:08:37.549
everything you hear
in his music,


154
00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:39.175
you know what I'm saying?

155
00:08:39.217 --> 00:08:41.511
Songs like "Ghetto Life"
and all that shit, like,


156
00:08:41.553 --> 00:08:45.223
that's Rick James,
man, in a nutshell.


157
00:08:45.265 --> 00:08:46.409
Like, you know what I'm saying?

158
00:08:46.433 --> 00:08:48.184
Coming from we from,
we all like that.


159
00:08:56.609 --> 00:08:58.111
He was born in 1948.

160
00:08:58.153 --> 00:09:00.864
So his growing up period
in Buffalo


161
00:09:00.905 --> 00:09:03.700
were really the 1950s.

162
00:09:03.742 --> 00:09:05.785
- Here today.
- Here today.


163
00:09:05.827 --> 00:09:07.954
To make you dance
the ghetto way.


164
00:09:07.996 --> 00:09:09.497
You telling me?

165
00:09:09.539 --> 00:09:11.875
And we're gonna sing
a little song...


166
00:09:11.916 --> 00:09:13.626
His first name is James.

167
00:09:13.668 --> 00:09:15.879
His second name is Ambrose

168
00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:17.064
'cause that's his father's name,

169
00:09:17.088 --> 00:09:19.716
so he was James Ambrose Johnson.

170
00:09:19.758 --> 00:09:21.259
And I do remember
when he was born.


171
00:09:21.301 --> 00:09:24.137
He was a little light,
bright dude, almost white.


172
00:09:24.179 --> 00:09:25.805
My dad was one of eight

173
00:09:25.847 --> 00:09:28.933
in a household
where his mom struggled.


174
00:09:28.975 --> 00:09:32.062
He watch his dad abuse his mom.

175
00:09:32.103 --> 00:09:34.189
His mother was
very protective of him.


176
00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:36.483
I feel like he was the favorite.

177
00:09:36.524 --> 00:09:39.235
She was a hustler,
and she did what she had to do


178
00:09:39.277 --> 00:09:40.904
to raise her eight children.

179
00:09:40.945 --> 00:09:43.406
My mother was
a very strong disciplinarian.


180
00:09:43.448 --> 00:09:45.867
We got a lot of what
they call whoopings


181
00:09:45.909 --> 00:09:48.453
with ironing cords...
What they call now child abuse.


182
00:09:48.495 --> 00:09:49.805
So I guess you might say,
in a kind of a way,


183
00:09:49.829 --> 00:09:53.208
I was an abused child.

184
00:09:53.249 --> 00:09:54.918
But I had a lot of love
in my family.


185
00:09:57.504 --> 00:09:59.631
My first sexual encounter,
I had when I was, like,


186
00:09:59.672 --> 00:10:01.132
eight or nine years old.

187
00:10:01.174 --> 00:10:02.592
And it was kind of
a strange thing,


188
00:10:02.634 --> 00:10:04.487
because, you know,
most men like to claim, like,


189
00:10:04.511 --> 00:10:06.971
the first time they make love,
they know exactly what to do,


190
00:10:07.013 --> 00:10:09.265
and, well,
that's a complete fallacy,


191
00:10:09.307 --> 00:10:10.934
a complete lie, you know.

192
00:10:10.975 --> 00:10:13.311
But when I was around 13,
there was this older woman,


193
00:10:13.353 --> 00:10:15.438
a friend of my mother's
babysat me.


194
00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:17.166
And I remember laying on
the bed, and this older woman,


195
00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:18.626
she started touching me
and doing these things,


196
00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:19.818
and it felt good to me.

197
00:10:19.859 --> 00:10:20.961
I'm not gonna sit here and lie.

198
00:10:20.985 --> 00:10:22.320
It didn't go very far...

199
00:10:22.362 --> 00:10:24.447
because my mother
came home early,


200
00:10:24.489 --> 00:10:26.991
and my mother snatched her
out of those covers.


201
00:10:27.033 --> 00:10:28.886
It's the first time I've ever
seen my mother fight.


202
00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:30.495
My mother just punched her,

203
00:10:30.537 --> 00:10:32.348
and, you know, and, "How could
you do this to my son?"


204
00:10:32.372 --> 00:10:34.141
And beat her down the stairs,
because in those days,


205
00:10:34.165 --> 00:10:35.667
it wasn't about,
you call this bureau,


206
00:10:35.708 --> 00:10:39.170
you call this association
for sexually abused children.


207
00:10:39.212 --> 00:10:40.523
If you caught something
like that going down


208
00:10:40.547 --> 00:10:42.382
where I grew up, you beat
the person down.


209
00:10:42.423 --> 00:10:43.423
That was it.

210
00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:48.596
In Buffalo,
the street life was...


211
00:10:48.638 --> 00:10:50.265
It was lively, man.

212
00:10:50.306 --> 00:10:52.308
There were a lot
of Black businesses,


213
00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:55.979
but most of your bigger ones
were numbers-orientated.


214
00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:57.689
Numbers today,
it would be the lotto.


215
00:10:57.730 --> 00:10:59.190
My mother got into that.

216
00:10:59.232 --> 00:11:01.484
My mother wanted to be
a dancer and a singer.


217
00:11:01.526 --> 00:11:03.361
It didn't take her too long
to see that


218
00:11:03.403 --> 00:11:05.697
working scrubbing floors
and washing dishes


219
00:11:05.738 --> 00:11:06.698
was not gonna make it.

220
00:11:06.739 --> 00:11:08.158
And she ran numbers,

221
00:11:08.199 --> 00:11:10.034
and she was making
a very good living.


222
00:11:10.076 --> 00:11:11.870
His mother, she introduced Rick

223
00:11:11.911 --> 00:11:13.371
to the numbers racket.

224
00:11:13.413 --> 00:11:15.707
Rick's job
was to pick up the money.


225
00:11:15.748 --> 00:11:19.002
That's his first involvement
in breaking the law.


226
00:11:19.043 --> 00:11:20.563
Rick and I went
to grammar school together


227
00:11:20.587 --> 00:11:22.922
from the third grade
through the eighth grade.


228
00:11:22.964 --> 00:11:24.549
As a child, he was, uh,

229
00:11:24.591 --> 00:11:26.509
rambunctious, like we all were.

230
00:11:26.551 --> 00:11:29.387
- Rick hated school.
- He was bored, like I was.


231
00:11:29.429 --> 00:11:31.014
And Rick wanted
to be a musician,


232
00:11:31.055 --> 00:11:32.390
and I thought he was nuts.

233
00:11:32.432 --> 00:11:33.725
Yeah.

234
00:11:35.101 --> 00:11:37.896
Yeah.

235
00:11:37.937 --> 00:11:40.064
What he really absorbed

236
00:11:40.106 --> 00:11:42.233
in that period were two things:

237
00:11:43.943 --> 00:11:46.404
Of Ray Charles and Bo Diddley
and Little Richard,


238
00:11:46.446 --> 00:11:48.406
but the other thing
he discovered in Buffalo...


239
00:11:48.448 --> 00:11:50.909
Because there was a club there
called the Royal Arms


240
00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:52.327
that he went to... was jazz.

241
00:11:52.368 --> 00:11:54.537
Headed for the station
with a pack on my back.


242
00:11:54.579 --> 00:11:56.664
He listened to music
all the time.


243
00:11:56.706 --> 00:11:59.209
My mother had
a huge jazz selection.


244
00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:03.254
- We had everything.
- I remember Louis Jordan.


245
00:12:03.296 --> 00:12:05.173
Take her right back
to the track, Jack.


246
00:12:06.966 --> 00:12:09.260
Rick was definitely
a musical prodigy,


247
00:12:09.302 --> 00:12:12.430
and he talked about hearing
Miles and Monk


248
00:12:12.472 --> 00:12:16.100
at a very, very early age,
in person,


249
00:12:16.142 --> 00:12:17.602
and getting it,

250
00:12:17.644 --> 00:12:20.563
understanding exactly
what these guys were doing.


251
00:12:20.605 --> 00:12:22.065
I was playing drums
when I was, like,


252
00:12:22.106 --> 00:12:23.566
I don't know,
nine, ten years old.


253
00:12:23.608 --> 00:12:25.902
My mother would take me
to blues and jazz clubs,


254
00:12:25.944 --> 00:12:27.237
and I'd sit in,

255
00:12:27.278 --> 00:12:28.905
but I just was able
to keep a beat,


256
00:12:28.947 --> 00:12:30.740
and I kinda knew automatically

257
00:12:30.782 --> 00:12:32.825
what I was supposed to be doing.

258
00:12:32.867 --> 00:12:34.994
He's hearing a lot of
funky R&B, gut bucket stuff,


259
00:12:35.036 --> 00:12:37.080
and, you know,

260
00:12:37.121 --> 00:12:38.957
begins to absorb
all these sounds


261
00:12:38.998 --> 00:12:40.458
that are coming at him.

262
00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:42.126
I don't know, growing up,
I guess I was


263
00:12:42.168 --> 00:12:43.461
sort of a ham, you know.

264
00:12:43.503 --> 00:12:45.964
I was, like,
always kind of crazy.


265
00:12:46.005 --> 00:12:48.341
And I always
liked entertainment,


266
00:12:48.383 --> 00:12:50.426
and I always liked singing,
and...


267
00:12:50.468 --> 00:12:52.762
just kind of joking around,
you know.


268
00:12:52.804 --> 00:12:56.140
My teacher either said
I was going to be...


269
00:12:56.182 --> 00:12:59.060
a hoodlum or a great
entertainer.


270
00:13:00.979 --> 00:13:02.331
If you lived
in Buffalo, and you were


271
00:13:02.355 --> 00:13:04.440
from the projects,
there were gangs galore,


272
00:13:04.482 --> 00:13:06.150
so you were not
gonna walk around


273
00:13:06.192 --> 00:13:08.653
and be without confrontation.

274
00:13:08.695 --> 00:13:12.573
- And he had his share.
- Rick was not a choir boy.


275
00:13:12.615 --> 00:13:14.826
There was a lot
of skirmishes with the law


276
00:13:14.867 --> 00:13:18.913
related to theft, burglary,
drug use, and so on,


277
00:13:18.955 --> 00:13:21.666
'cause he was introduced
to drugs pretty early.


278
00:13:22.292 --> 00:13:25.169
The city of Buffalo
grew up as a port


279
00:13:25.211 --> 00:13:28.840
and became
a great industrial center.


280
00:13:28.881 --> 00:13:32.969
But in recent times,
Buffalo has been changing.


281
00:13:33.011 --> 00:13:36.681
Businesses gone, jobs gone,

282
00:13:36.723 --> 00:13:39.350
people gone.

283
00:13:39.392 --> 00:13:41.519
In the '60s in Buffalo,

284
00:13:41.561 --> 00:13:44.480
people were just tired
of the segregation.


285
00:13:44.522 --> 00:13:46.899
It was basically schools,

286
00:13:46.941 --> 00:13:50.194
bussing, jobs,

287
00:13:50.236 --> 00:13:52.322
and the lack thereof.

288
00:13:54.282 --> 00:13:55.384
Buffalo is probably
one of the most


289
00:13:55.408 --> 00:13:57.201
racist cities in the world.

290
00:13:57.243 --> 00:13:58.870
I used to love that little sign

291
00:13:58.911 --> 00:14:00.330
as you're coming in,

292
00:14:00.371 --> 00:14:02.206
where it says
the "All-American City."


293
00:14:02.248 --> 00:14:03.499
I used to laugh at that.

294
00:14:03.541 --> 00:14:05.501
It is the All-American city,
all right...


295
00:14:05.543 --> 00:14:07.378
Racist right down
to the bone, you know?


296
00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:10.131
At that time, it was
the whole Black power thing.


297
00:14:12.508 --> 00:14:15.219
We were all into wearing
daishikis and stuff back then.


298
00:14:15.261 --> 00:14:16.971
I had just left high school

299
00:14:17.013 --> 00:14:20.516
because I wanted to play with
this African culture group.


300
00:14:20.558 --> 00:14:22.643
And I played conga drums.

301
00:14:22.685 --> 00:14:24.896
Everybody that I knew back then

302
00:14:24.937 --> 00:14:27.565
wanted to get the hell
out of town, out of Buffalo,


303
00:14:27.607 --> 00:14:29.734
but when we got of age,
there was a war.


304
00:14:34.697 --> 00:14:36.407
And not trying to be funny,
but that got


305
00:14:36.449 --> 00:14:38.242
a lot of guys
out of the neighborhood.


306
00:14:38.284 --> 00:14:41.120
Situation
in Vietnam is difficult,


307
00:14:41.162 --> 00:14:43.623
but there is
an old American saying


308
00:14:43.664 --> 00:14:46.250
that when the going gets tough,

309
00:14:46.292 --> 00:14:48.628
the tough get going.

310
00:14:48.669 --> 00:14:51.089
You had to go
to Fort Here and Fort There,


311
00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:52.983
and so that's how we learned
about the rest of the world.


312
00:14:53.007 --> 00:14:55.551
He had tried to go in the Navy,
and that didn't work.


313
00:14:55.593 --> 00:14:56.969
I was getting ready
to get drafted.


314
00:14:57.011 --> 00:14:58.781
So they said, "You know,
if you join the reserves,


315
00:14:58.805 --> 00:15:00.515
you won't have to go
to Vietnam,"


316
00:15:00.556 --> 00:15:01.992
but they didn't tell me
if I didn't go to meetings,


317
00:15:02.016 --> 00:15:03.518
I'd go to active duty,

318
00:15:03.559 --> 00:15:04.977
So I stopped going
to the meetings,


319
00:15:05.019 --> 00:15:06.938
and of course, they sent me
on active duty.


320
00:15:06.979 --> 00:15:09.690
Sustained guitar note.

321
00:15:09.732 --> 00:15:11.275
We got in there, man.

322
00:15:11.317 --> 00:15:14.070
It was too rigid,
too disciplined.


323
00:15:14.112 --> 00:15:16.447
Ain't no place to be
if you're a free spirit.


324
00:15:16.489 --> 00:15:18.133
Tell you what time to get up,
what to put on,


325
00:15:18.157 --> 00:15:21.619
when to take a shower,
when to do everything.


326
00:15:21.661 --> 00:15:23.746
You know, quote,
"That makes you a man."


327
00:15:23.788 --> 00:15:26.124
- No, it don't.
- Makes you a goddamn robot.


328
00:15:26.165 --> 00:15:28.876
I don't think
no Black man should really be,


329
00:15:28.918 --> 00:15:30.711
we'll just say,
drafted into the service.


330
00:15:30.753 --> 00:15:32.463
Actually, I think it really
should be


331
00:15:32.505 --> 00:15:35.091
a voluntary basis
for a Black man.


332
00:15:35.133 --> 00:15:38.219
Every Black man, send him off
to Vietnam, he go out there,


333
00:15:38.261 --> 00:15:41.055
fight, get shot up, yet still,
he come back to the States,


334
00:15:41.097 --> 00:15:43.641
and he can't buy a house,
and so what's the point?


335
00:15:43.683 --> 00:15:45.160
You know, here I come
from the street,


336
00:15:45.184 --> 00:15:47.979
playing African music
and being real Afro-centric,


337
00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:49.939
all of a sudden
into this white society


338
00:15:49.981 --> 00:15:52.275
of a uniform
and white authority,


339
00:15:52.316 --> 00:15:54.152
and it was a terrible change.

340
00:15:54.193 --> 00:15:55.611
I mean, I wasn't ready for it.

341
00:15:55.653 --> 00:15:57.453
My mind was saying,
"Something is wrong here."


342
00:15:57.488 --> 00:15:59.240
That's when I decided
to go to Canada.


343
00:16:06.747 --> 00:16:10.918
Rick went AWOL
and wound up in Canada


344
00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:13.921
and gravitated to Toronto,

345
00:16:13.963 --> 00:16:18.342
where there was a burgeoning
folk rock and roll scene.


346
00:16:18.384 --> 00:16:20.678
This is Yorkville Village,

347
00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:23.514
a phenomena in Toronto
in the mid-'60s...


348
00:16:23.556 --> 00:16:25.933
A colorful, quaint,
cacophonous community


349
00:16:25.975 --> 00:16:27.768
with a split personality.

350
00:16:27.810 --> 00:16:30.480
When the sun goes down,
Yorkville becomes


351
00:16:30.521 --> 00:16:33.107
the no man's land
of the teenagers.


352
00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:40.698
It's interesting how
this whole Canadian entry


353
00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:44.118
begins with Rick
because he's in Toronto,


354
00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:47.038
he's walking down the street,
somebody calls him the N-word,


355
00:16:47.079 --> 00:16:49.874
looks like they're gonna
jump him, there's a scuffle.


356
00:16:49.916 --> 00:16:52.376
Yow! Trap door.

357
00:16:52.418 --> 00:16:53.794
Well, what happened was,

358
00:16:53.836 --> 00:16:55.436
some white boys started
fighting with me.


359
00:16:55.463 --> 00:16:56.732
Now here I am,
thinking that white people


360
00:16:56.756 --> 00:16:58.633
are cool in Canada,
and I get in this fight.


361
00:16:58.674 --> 00:17:00.968
And some guys came to my defense

362
00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:03.012
and beat these guys up
'cause I was a little guy;


363
00:17:03.054 --> 00:17:04.263
I was a little skinny kid.

364
00:17:04.305 --> 00:17:06.182
But the guys
who beat these guys up


365
00:17:06.224 --> 00:17:08.935
were in a band called The Hawks.

366
00:17:08.976 --> 00:17:11.562
Later, it turned out
they called themselves.


367
00:17:11.604 --> 00:17:13.773
The Band... Robbie Robertson,
Levon Helm...


368
00:17:13.814 --> 00:17:15.083
And they played
behind Bob Dylan.


369
00:17:15.107 --> 00:17:16.817
And they kind of rescued me.

370
00:17:16.859 --> 00:17:18.986
And they kind of took me
under their wing.


371
00:17:19.028 --> 00:17:21.364
You know, the Toronto scene,
where he ends up,


372
00:17:21.405 --> 00:17:23.300
pretty much like what was
happening in Greenwich Village,


373
00:17:23.324 --> 00:17:24.867
in New York, at that time.

374
00:17:24.909 --> 00:17:27.828
The music scene
was extremely active.


375
00:17:27.870 --> 00:17:32.416
Yorkville Avenue
had door-to-door clubs


376
00:17:32.458 --> 00:17:34.752
and patios and bars,

377
00:17:34.794 --> 00:17:37.547
and every one of them
had a band.


378
00:17:37.588 --> 00:17:40.007
Rick found his people, you know,

379
00:17:40.049 --> 00:17:42.176
found kind of a tribe
in the mid-'60s.


380
00:17:42.218 --> 00:17:44.220
When I went to Canada,
I was really at a point


381
00:17:44.262 --> 00:17:46.097
in my life where I didn't like
white people


382
00:17:46.138 --> 00:17:47.932
because I was seeing
what they were doing.


383
00:17:47.974 --> 00:17:50.226
But it seemed like
the Canadian white people


384
00:17:50.268 --> 00:17:51.936
that I met were friendly,

385
00:17:51.978 --> 00:17:53.563
and they didn't have this hatred

386
00:17:53.604 --> 00:17:55.982
and this animosity
towards Black people.


387
00:17:56.023 --> 00:18:00.570
The Canadian musicians on
Yorkville were very inventive,


388
00:18:00.611 --> 00:18:03.698
and Rick fit in
very well with them.


389
00:18:03.739 --> 00:18:05.551
He's meeting and hanging out
with Joni Mitchell,


390
00:18:05.575 --> 00:18:07.368
and he's hanging out
with Neil Young.


391
00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:08.953
So he's in this stew pot

392
00:18:08.995 --> 00:18:12.498
of all this mid-'60s music
and flow,


393
00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:15.001
and he's 17, 18,

394
00:18:15.042 --> 00:18:18.754
living in that
and figuring that out.


395
00:18:18.796 --> 00:18:22.133
Whatever this
new music was, he could do it.


396
00:18:22.174 --> 00:18:26.095
It didn't really matter that
he was a brother from Buffalo.


397
00:18:26.137 --> 00:18:27.471
He could adapt.

398
00:18:27.513 --> 00:18:29.473
He went by many different names.

399
00:18:29.515 --> 00:18:30.933
He was always changing his name

400
00:18:30.975 --> 00:18:32.244
because he didn't want
to get caught.


401
00:18:32.268 --> 00:18:33.936
I was sitting
around a restaurant,


402
00:18:33.978 --> 00:18:35.163
and this friend of mine
was saying, he's saying,


403
00:18:35.187 --> 00:18:36.623
"You're running away
from the service,


404
00:18:36.647 --> 00:18:37.815
you gotta have another name."

405
00:18:37.857 --> 00:18:40.318
And this girl,
who was a singer in Canada...


406
00:18:40.359 --> 00:18:42.153
Her name was Shirley Matthews...

407
00:18:42.194 --> 00:18:43.946
She says, "Well," she says,

408
00:18:43.988 --> 00:18:45.489
"I got a cousin
named Rickie Matthews.


409
00:18:45.531 --> 00:18:47.491
Why don't you call yourself
Rickie Matthews?"


410
00:18:47.533 --> 00:18:49.619
So, I said Rickie,
and I put my name...


411
00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:51.412
Middle name James Matthews.

412
00:18:51.454 --> 00:18:52.955
So it was Rickie James Matthews.

413
00:18:52.997 --> 00:18:54.725
And that's when I had the band
with Neil Young.


414
00:18:54.749 --> 00:18:56.250
- Hey, man?
- Yeah?


415
00:18:56.292 --> 00:18:57.894
What's that little
black thing in the corner


416
00:18:57.918 --> 00:19:00.171
- with the yellow beak?
- That's a mynah bird!


417
00:19:00.212 --> 00:19:01.481
I joined this group,
and we called ourselves.


418
00:19:01.505 --> 00:19:03.549
The Sailor Boys,
and then later on,


419
00:19:03.591 --> 00:19:04.967
we stopped
wearing my sailor suits


420
00:19:05.009 --> 00:19:06.609
and just wore whatever
we wanted to wear,


421
00:19:06.636 --> 00:19:08.304
and we called ourselves
the Mynah Birds.


422
00:19:08.346 --> 00:19:10.723
So this group is Rickie Mathews,

423
00:19:10.765 --> 00:19:15.061
Neil Young on guitar,
and Bruce Palmer on bass.


424
00:19:15.102 --> 00:19:17.355
Those two guys
end up in Buffalo Springfield.


425
00:19:21.233 --> 00:19:23.194
But, you know, we're getting
ahead of the story.


426
00:19:23.235 --> 00:19:25.738
There's John Taylor

427
00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:28.491
and Rickman Mason on drums.

428
00:19:28.532 --> 00:19:30.701
We played rock, R&B.

429
00:19:30.743 --> 00:19:32.578
We didn't get
into any folky stuff.


430
00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:35.206
- That's all we did.
- That was our job.


431
00:19:35.247 --> 00:19:38.459
We lived in probably

432
00:19:38.501 --> 00:19:41.962
We got our own apartment,
and the next thing you know,


433
00:19:42.004 --> 00:19:44.465
there was 15 people
living in the apartment.


434
00:19:44.507 --> 00:19:46.509
We had a very big
following around Toronto.


435
00:19:46.550 --> 00:19:47.903
It was us
playing around the village,


436
00:19:47.927 --> 00:19:49.470
and we were all
just starving musicians


437
00:19:49.512 --> 00:19:50.888
who just loved music.

438
00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:52.890
Rick... very talented musician.

439
00:19:52.932 --> 00:19:56.394
He knew what he wanted to do,
and that got done that way.


440
00:19:56.435 --> 00:19:59.063
Actually, we basically followed
his lead through tunes.


441
00:19:59.105 --> 00:20:00.564
Me and Neil
wrote a lot of stuff.


442
00:20:00.606 --> 00:20:03.359
Neil was very fluent
on acoustic,


443
00:20:03.401 --> 00:20:05.420
and he taught me a lot
of chords and different stuff.


444
00:20:05.444 --> 00:20:06.672
Some people say
it's hard to imagine.


445
00:20:06.696 --> 00:20:07.923
Neil Young
and Rick James together,


446
00:20:07.947 --> 00:20:09.508
but really, when you think
about it, it's not


447
00:20:09.532 --> 00:20:10.908
'cause I was singing
in those days,


448
00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:12.594
and I really wasn't
playing guitar or anything.


449
00:20:12.618 --> 00:20:13.804
I was kind of playing
a little harmonica.


450
00:20:13.828 --> 00:20:17.540
Neil was into
very melodic chords,


451
00:20:17.581 --> 00:20:19.208
real pretty kind of chords,
you know,


452
00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:23.045
and I would write kind of
R&B lyrics over these chords.


453
00:20:23.087 --> 00:20:24.940
So really, it was
a very interesting combination.


454
00:20:24.964 --> 00:20:26.590
We had this manager,
and he thought,


455
00:20:26.632 --> 00:20:28.276
you know, we were great,
and, you know, he used to come


456
00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:29.468
to our shows all the time.

457
00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:31.262
And he ended up going to Motown

458
00:20:31.303 --> 00:20:33.597
and telling Motown about us,
and they flew us down.


459
00:20:33.639 --> 00:20:36.809
The Mynah Birds
do an audition at Motown,


460
00:20:36.851 --> 00:20:40.229
They get signed, and they go
and they cut four songs.


461
00:20:40.271 --> 00:20:44.233
So, this is a copy of
the actual multitrack session.


462
00:20:44.275 --> 00:20:46.944
Motown had master tape...
Master reels.


463
00:20:46.986 --> 00:20:49.613
Here it is. "It's My Time."
Take 21, people.


464
00:20:53.492 --> 00:20:55.035
I mean, I can't play,
but, you know.


465
00:20:57.621 --> 00:20:59.957
I really love you, darling.

466
00:20:59.999 --> 00:21:04.128
A love that's so strong
and so fine...


467
00:21:04.170 --> 00:21:05.963
Being signed
to Motown, it was fabulous,


468
00:21:06.005 --> 00:21:07.631
especially white people too.

469
00:21:07.673 --> 00:21:10.634
They just accepted us
like whammo,


470
00:21:10.676 --> 00:21:11.945
and we were in there
and recording,


471
00:21:11.969 --> 00:21:15.306
And it was a whirlwind,
actually,


472
00:21:15.347 --> 00:21:18.476
'cause all's I remember
is 24/7 being in the studio.


473
00:21:18.517 --> 00:21:20.978
Actually, Rick disappeared
out of the studio somewhere


474
00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:22.038
and passed out on the steps,

475
00:21:22.062 --> 00:21:23.290
and they found him
an hour later.


476
00:21:23.314 --> 00:21:24.857
Love you anyway.

477
00:21:24.899 --> 00:21:25.899
Cue Neil Young.

478
00:21:28.486 --> 00:21:30.130
We had the Supremes
come in and back us up,


479
00:21:30.154 --> 00:21:31.697
and Stevie Wonder would jump in

480
00:21:31.739 --> 00:21:32.823
and play a little keyboard.

481
00:21:32.865 --> 00:21:35.159
It was a great time.

482
00:21:35.201 --> 00:21:36.494
It's my time.

483
00:21:36.535 --> 00:21:37.787
It feels like it's my time

484
00:21:37.828 --> 00:21:40.039
I'm gonna love you anyway.

485
00:21:41.081 --> 00:21:43.334
I mean, you know,
I feel like a kid


486
00:21:43.375 --> 00:21:45.377
playing my favorite singles
when I hear that,


487
00:21:45.419 --> 00:21:48.130
and, you know...

488
00:21:48.172 --> 00:21:50.216
But Rick is trying to sound
like Mick Jagger.


489
00:21:50.257 --> 00:21:53.093
I can't get no.

490
00:21:53.135 --> 00:21:55.679
Satisfaction.

491
00:21:55.721 --> 00:21:57.932
He used Mick Jagger's
actions too.


492
00:21:57.973 --> 00:22:00.309
I think he really liked
the way Mick moved.


493
00:22:00.351 --> 00:22:01.870
He was interested
in being a rock star,


494
00:22:01.894 --> 00:22:03.479
and it's not surprising.

495
00:22:03.521 --> 00:22:07.525
I mean, a lot of Black artists
of the 1960s were inspired


496
00:22:07.566 --> 00:22:12.363
by the rock movement as much as
or more than R&B music.


497
00:22:18.661 --> 00:22:20.871
In love.

498
00:22:20.913 --> 00:22:22.790
If a pain in...

499
00:22:22.832 --> 00:22:23.892
When you hear the Mynah Birds,

500
00:22:23.916 --> 00:22:25.209
there's a moment
where your brain


501
00:22:25.251 --> 00:22:27.044
can't quite accept
that it's Rick James.


502
00:22:27.086 --> 00:22:28.730
You tell people,
"You know that's Rick James,"


503
00:22:28.754 --> 00:22:31.757
and they go,
"Oh, right. Right."


504
00:22:31.799 --> 00:22:35.052
Kind of lean in
and listen to go, "Oh,"


505
00:22:35.094 --> 00:22:36.738
'cause there's a quality
to his voice that's unique.


506
00:22:36.762 --> 00:22:39.223
And it didn't last.

507
00:22:39.265 --> 00:22:42.685
Like you thought it would.

508
00:22:42.726 --> 00:22:44.562
I think there's a somewhat

509
00:22:44.603 --> 00:22:47.273
of a vulnerability there
that I hadn't heard before.


510
00:22:47.314 --> 00:22:48.399
Hadn't heard since.

511
00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:50.526
He's 18 and trying
to figure something out.


512
00:22:50.568 --> 00:22:51.944
Sentimental piano chords.

513
00:22:51.986 --> 00:22:54.405
Rick is thinking,
"Okay, we're on Motown.


514
00:22:54.446 --> 00:22:55.948
We're gonna be popular.

515
00:22:55.990 --> 00:22:59.076
We've got a built-in
promotional machine.


516
00:22:59.118 --> 00:22:59.827
We're going."

517
00:22:59.869 --> 00:23:01.036
But the Mynah Birds,

518
00:23:01.078 --> 00:23:02.913
they had fired their manager.

519
00:23:02.955 --> 00:23:05.207
Our manager,
Morley Shelman, got upset,


520
00:23:05.249 --> 00:23:07.918
and somehow Morley
knew Rick was a draft dodger


521
00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:09.753
and squealed on him.

522
00:23:09.795 --> 00:23:12.047
Rickie gets snatched back
by the Navy,


523
00:23:12.089 --> 00:23:14.258
has to go in the brig
'cause he's been AWOL.


524
00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:17.678
We had no idea
that he was a draft dodger.


525
00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:19.430
None at all.

526
00:23:19.471 --> 00:23:21.932
We had no Rick, so we had
to find another singer.


527
00:23:21.974 --> 00:23:24.101
We had a couple of jobs to play.

528
00:23:24.143 --> 00:23:25.787
There was really not much
to talk about, I guess.


529
00:23:25.811 --> 00:23:28.272
It just was bam. Over.

530
00:23:32.318 --> 00:23:33.903
Well, after I got out
of the brig,


531
00:23:33.944 --> 00:23:35.404
I went back home for a while,

532
00:23:35.446 --> 00:23:37.299
and I had to decide what
I wanted to do with my life.


533
00:23:37.323 --> 00:23:38.592
I mean, you gotta understand,
it was like three years,


534
00:23:38.616 --> 00:23:41.410
four years of my life
now have passed by.


535
00:23:41.452 --> 00:23:43.471
You know, so I had to get used
to my family all over again,


536
00:23:43.495 --> 00:23:45.414
and, you know,
and just... you know,


537
00:23:45.456 --> 00:23:46.933
I had to get used to me again,
you know,


538
00:23:46.957 --> 00:23:48.417
find out what I wanted to do.

539
00:23:48.459 --> 00:23:50.920
And the outcome was the same...
Music, music, music.


540
00:23:50.961 --> 00:23:52.463
I wanted to make music.

541
00:23:52.504 --> 00:23:54.673
The Mynah Birds
don't have the kind of success


542
00:23:54.715 --> 00:23:57.092
that Rick James was hoping for.

543
00:23:57.134 --> 00:24:00.346
But he ends up
doing more work for Motown


544
00:24:00.387 --> 00:24:02.848
as a session songwriter

545
00:24:02.890 --> 00:24:06.393
and arranger,
among other things.


546
00:24:06.435 --> 00:24:09.229
From Michigan's
Motor Town, a new export


547
00:24:09.271 --> 00:24:13.400
was added to cars...
The Detroit sound.


548
00:24:13.442 --> 00:24:17.571
My world is empty
without you, babe.


549
00:24:17.613 --> 00:24:20.074
It's not a one-man organization
or a two-man organization,


550
00:24:20.115 --> 00:24:23.077
but it is an organization
of teamwork.


551
00:24:23.118 --> 00:24:24.495
Rick would go to Motown.

552
00:24:24.536 --> 00:24:25.829
He would write.

553
00:24:25.871 --> 00:24:27.140
There would be
Holland-Dozier-Holland


554
00:24:27.164 --> 00:24:29.124
and Norman Whitfield
and Bobby Taylor,


555
00:24:29.166 --> 00:24:31.502
and a whole bunch of people
hanging around,


556
00:24:31.543 --> 00:24:34.296
and was part of the machine.

557
00:24:34.338 --> 00:24:36.138
It was very hard for me
to get into the studio


558
00:24:36.173 --> 00:24:37.675
because, I mean,
there was so much


559
00:24:37.716 --> 00:24:39.510
competition of great people.

560
00:24:39.551 --> 00:24:41.345
So I just really spent
a couple years


561
00:24:41.387 --> 00:24:43.055
just learning my craft.

562
00:24:43.097 --> 00:24:46.517
Rick doesn't do well
with authority,


563
00:24:46.558 --> 00:24:50.896
and Motown was a highly
authoritarian climate.


564
00:24:50.938 --> 00:24:52.606
He didn't have any hits,

565
00:24:52.648 --> 00:24:56.318
and he was
an impatient young man.


566
00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:58.862
And when it didn't happen
in a hurry,


567
00:24:58.904 --> 00:25:00.364
he got out of dodge.

568
00:25:04.284 --> 00:25:05.911
I just felt I was going nowhere.

569
00:25:05.953 --> 00:25:07.496
What I wanted to do
was rock and roll,


570
00:25:07.538 --> 00:25:10.416
and what I wanted to do,
Motown was not doing,


571
00:25:10.457 --> 00:25:12.376
and I wanted to take
what they were doing


572
00:25:12.418 --> 00:25:15.212
a step farther,
and I couldn't do it there.


573
00:25:15.254 --> 00:25:17.881
So me and a bass player
named Gregory,


574
00:25:17.923 --> 00:25:19.842
we headed out to California,

575
00:25:19.883 --> 00:25:24.138
and a whole
nother thing happened.


576
00:25:24.179 --> 00:25:26.890
It's in California

577
00:25:26.932 --> 00:25:28.809
where Rick James
becomes Rick James.


578
00:25:28.851 --> 00:25:31.729
With some stumbles
along the way.


579
00:25:31.770 --> 00:25:34.523
They audition for bass
for Crosby, Stills, and Nash,


580
00:25:34.565 --> 00:25:36.900
- and Reeves got the gig.
- Rick didn't.


581
00:25:36.942 --> 00:25:41.905
He had designs of continuing
what he had begun in Canada,


582
00:25:41.947 --> 00:25:44.742
which was to be part
of this kind of


583
00:25:44.783 --> 00:25:47.411
burgeoning folk rock culture.

584
00:25:47.453 --> 00:25:51.874
He watched these people
who he had first met in Canada


585
00:25:51.915 --> 00:25:54.501
begin to really get over big,

586
00:25:54.543 --> 00:25:57.921
and whether as a bass player,
whether as a vocalist,


587
00:25:57.963 --> 00:25:59.923
he wanted in.

588
00:25:59.965 --> 00:26:01.258
And it didn't happen.

589
00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:02.634
You know, they got these houses,

590
00:26:02.676 --> 00:26:04.237
and, you know, all these
gold albums and stuff,


591
00:26:04.261 --> 00:26:05.846
and Buffalo Springfield
are doing well,


592
00:26:05.888 --> 00:26:07.115
and here I am,
feeling like shit.


593
00:26:07.139 --> 00:26:08.015
You know, I'm saying,
like, you know,


594
00:26:08.057 --> 00:26:09.200
"Why don't I have any of this?

595
00:26:09.224 --> 00:26:10.684
You know,
what's wrong with me?"


596
00:26:10.726 --> 00:26:12.162
He gets in this band
called Salt 'N' Pepper.


597
00:26:12.186 --> 00:26:13.913
- Interracial band, right?
- Salt 'N' Pepper.


598
00:26:13.937 --> 00:26:14.813
They get their big break.

599
00:26:14.855 --> 00:26:16.023
They open for Jethro Tull

600
00:26:16.065 --> 00:26:17.483
at the Fillmore West,

601
00:26:17.524 --> 00:26:19.610
- and then they break up.
- Doesn't happen.


602
00:26:19.651 --> 00:26:20.778
When I met Rick,

603
00:26:20.819 --> 00:26:23.280
he was in and out
of several bands.


604
00:26:23.322 --> 00:26:26.575
He was in a band, and then
it would be short-lived,


605
00:26:26.617 --> 00:26:28.702
for one reason or another.

606
00:26:28.744 --> 00:26:32.581
And then my job was to get him
out of all those contracts.


607
00:26:32.623 --> 00:26:35.459
Take him down a country road...

608
00:26:35.501 --> 00:26:37.211
Then there's a band
out of Toronto


609
00:26:37.252 --> 00:26:38.712
called Heaven and Earth.

610
00:26:38.754 --> 00:26:41.423
And this is a band where
they're incorporating horns.


611
00:26:41.465 --> 00:26:44.927
Heaven and Earth
was like a blues band.


612
00:26:44.968 --> 00:26:47.888
Rick wrote
some amazing love songs.


613
00:26:47.930 --> 00:26:50.933
That band mutates
into White Cane.


614
00:26:53.185 --> 00:26:56.647
He worked that band hard,
and that was a leap up.


615
00:26:56.688 --> 00:27:00.609
- The music was hard-driving.
- It was just spectacular music.


616
00:27:00.651 --> 00:27:03.904
We heard about this group
called White Cane


617
00:27:03.946 --> 00:27:05.030
at the Whiskey.

618
00:27:05.072 --> 00:27:06.281
Gotta see it.

619
00:27:06.323 --> 00:27:09.368
We were gonna see,
you know, this guy.


620
00:27:09.409 --> 00:27:11.662
And he played the guitar
and wore a hat


621
00:27:11.703 --> 00:27:13.539
almost just like this.

622
00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:16.959
Rick was very electric,
you know.


623
00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.586
We all whispered, like,
"Wow," you know,


624
00:27:19.628 --> 00:27:21.463
"He's gonna do something."

625
00:27:21.505 --> 00:27:23.590
Rick, in the middle of the tour,

626
00:27:23.632 --> 00:27:25.634
gets into arguments
with the band


627
00:27:25.676 --> 00:27:29.012
about Rick stopping the music
and addressing the audience,


628
00:27:29.054 --> 00:27:32.307
getting them to clap
or say things in unison.


629
00:27:32.349 --> 00:27:36.019
- And the tour fell apart.
- Rick left the band.


630
00:27:36.061 --> 00:27:39.606
I've never seen anybody with
so much drive and ambition


631
00:27:39.648 --> 00:27:43.277
to make it, and frustration
because he wasn't making it.


632
00:27:47.072 --> 00:27:49.032
I met my first true love

633
00:27:49.074 --> 00:27:50.176
when I came out to California.

634
00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:51.535
Her name was Syville.

635
00:27:51.577 --> 00:27:54.371
We met at, like, this crazy
Halloween party.


636
00:27:54.413 --> 00:27:56.540
- Drugs, sex everywhere.
- It was decadent.


637
00:27:56.582 --> 00:27:59.376
It was like Dionysius
or something going on.


638
00:27:59.418 --> 00:28:00.836
Your daughter just informed me

639
00:28:00.878 --> 00:28:02.796
that the party you were at
was actually an orgy.


640
00:28:02.838 --> 00:28:05.674
It was a party and an orgy.

641
00:28:05.716 --> 00:28:09.511
You know, but it was civilized,
you know.


642
00:28:09.553 --> 00:28:11.263
It wasn't just crazy.

643
00:28:11.305 --> 00:28:15.934
I saw Rick sitting in the seat
right by the kitchen area.


644
00:28:15.976 --> 00:28:17.436
He was, you know,

645
00:28:17.477 --> 00:28:19.605
a very nice-looking man,
very intelligent.


646
00:28:19.646 --> 00:28:22.858
There was a lot about him,
you know, that I liked.


647
00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:25.861
Eventually, he came over
to where I was sitting.


648
00:28:25.903 --> 00:28:29.031
He said, "Syville,
do you wanna go with me?"


649
00:28:29.072 --> 00:28:31.241
And I said, "Well, yeah."

650
00:28:32.618 --> 00:28:33.845
I ended up
going over to her place,


651
00:28:33.869 --> 00:28:35.704
and a few years later,
I was still there.


652
00:28:35.746 --> 00:28:38.081
We had two children:
My daughter Ty,


653
00:28:38.123 --> 00:28:40.042
and a son named Rickie.

654
00:28:40.083 --> 00:28:43.921
- He was absent.
- He was pursuing his career.


655
00:28:43.962 --> 00:28:45.839
He was chasing his dreams.

656
00:28:45.881 --> 00:28:47.424
I'm sure him and my mom

657
00:28:47.466 --> 00:28:51.261
had their reasons
for whatever took place.


658
00:28:51.303 --> 00:28:55.682
That's how life was,
and you have to go with that.


659
00:28:55.724 --> 00:28:59.019
When he got to LA,
he got right smack dab


660
00:28:59.061 --> 00:29:00.604
in the middle of hippie culture,

661
00:29:00.646 --> 00:29:02.231
and he met Jay Sebring,

662
00:29:02.272 --> 00:29:03.732
who was
a well-known hairdresser,


663
00:29:03.774 --> 00:29:05.943
who knew Sharon Tate.

664
00:29:05.984 --> 00:29:09.613
And he was invited to a party,
and that turned out


665
00:29:09.655 --> 00:29:12.658
to be the party
of the Manson murders.


666
00:29:12.699 --> 00:29:14.409
An employee came to work

667
00:29:14.451 --> 00:29:16.662
and found several bodies
in the house.


668
00:29:16.703 --> 00:29:19.414
The tentative identification
of the persons are as follows:


669
00:29:19.456 --> 00:29:23.627
Sharon Polanski, Jay Sebring.

670
00:29:23.669 --> 00:29:26.088
We was supposed
to go to a party,


671
00:29:26.129 --> 00:29:27.965
and I wanted to go.

672
00:29:28.006 --> 00:29:29.675
And he said he was tired,

673
00:29:29.716 --> 00:29:31.218
and, you know,
he didn't want to go.


674
00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:33.595
He said, "We'll do something
else another day."


675
00:29:33.637 --> 00:29:35.597
Do you believe that

676
00:29:35.639 --> 00:29:37.474
there should be a death penalty?

677
00:29:37.516 --> 00:29:41.770
- A death penalty?
- Aren't we all born to die?


678
00:29:41.812 --> 00:29:44.481
After Jay died,
I was really distraught.


679
00:29:44.523 --> 00:29:47.442
What were
you doing during the '70s?


680
00:29:47.484 --> 00:29:51.280
- Tripping around. Going nuts.
- Writing music.


681
00:29:51.321 --> 00:29:52.840
Getting turned down
by record companies.


682
00:29:52.864 --> 00:29:56.326
I think hustle is just part
of the American DNA.


683
00:29:56.368 --> 00:29:57.828
And Rick
was definitely a hustler.


684
00:29:57.869 --> 00:30:01.331
And I mean that in a good way
because he did survive.


685
00:30:01.373 --> 00:30:04.001
When the California
hippie thing didn't work out,


686
00:30:04.042 --> 00:30:06.503
he'd go home, he'd deal drugs,

687
00:30:06.545 --> 00:30:09.006
he'd have big shipments
coming in from God knows where.


688
00:30:09.047 --> 00:30:11.758
He did all kinds of crazy shit.

689
00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:14.052
I went to Canada
for a brief moment,


690
00:30:14.094 --> 00:30:16.805
and I met a friend up there,
and, uh...


691
00:30:16.847 --> 00:30:19.141
we went to Colombia,
South America.


692
00:30:19.182 --> 00:30:21.560
I really don't even know if I
should get into it, you know?


693
00:30:21.601 --> 00:30:24.354
Anyway, went to South America,
and we did this deal,


694
00:30:24.396 --> 00:30:25.814
and we made a bunch of money.

695
00:30:25.856 --> 00:30:28.692
I took that money,
and I went to Buffalo.


696
00:30:28.734 --> 00:30:30.986
When you really get confused,
you go home to your mother.


697
00:30:31.028 --> 00:30:32.922
- I says, "Mom, I'm tired.
- I've been away from home,


698
00:30:32.946 --> 00:30:35.032
- like, eight or nine years.
- Nothing's happening."


699
00:30:35.073 --> 00:30:37.326
So I start getting
into being at home with her,


700
00:30:37.367 --> 00:30:39.536
and listening to the music
going around,


701
00:30:39.578 --> 00:30:41.163
and it was in the ghetto,

702
00:30:41.204 --> 00:30:42.873
so I listened
to a lot of Black music.


703
00:30:42.914 --> 00:30:44.875
And I was hearing
the Parliament-Funkadelics


704
00:30:44.916 --> 00:30:46.960
and Bootsy
and all that kind of stuff.


705
00:30:47.002 --> 00:30:48.879
And I start saying,
"Well, this is kind of


706
00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:53.508
- like my concept... rock and funk.
- But not the way I would do it."


707
00:30:53.550 --> 00:30:55.469
I wanted to be nasty,
and I wanted to be raw,


708
00:30:55.510 --> 00:30:58.555
and I if I hit a bad chord
or a bad note in my record,


709
00:30:58.597 --> 00:31:00.182
and it made sense, I'd keep it.

710
00:31:00.223 --> 00:31:01.558
Or if I hit a bad note, vocally,

711
00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:03.393
and if it had the magic,
I'd keep it.


712
00:31:09.232 --> 00:31:11.568
You and I.

713
00:31:11.610 --> 00:31:15.072
We fit together
like a glove on hand.


714
00:31:15.113 --> 00:31:17.157
That's right.

715
00:31:17.199 --> 00:31:19.576
Don't you know.

716
00:31:19.618 --> 00:31:22.954
That I would gladly
take you anywhere.


717
00:31:22.996 --> 00:31:24.790
You wanted to go...

718
00:31:24.831 --> 00:31:26.583
I had written these songs
when I was staying


719
00:31:26.625 --> 00:31:28.251
with my mother
at home in Buffalo.


720
00:31:28.293 --> 00:31:31.129
I got some neighborhood
musicians, and we recorded.


721
00:31:31.171 --> 00:31:33.048
Wouldn't you agree?

722
00:31:33.090 --> 00:31:36.259
And if by chance...

723
00:31:36.301 --> 00:31:38.095
I took the tape, and I came out

724
00:31:38.136 --> 00:31:39.322
to Los Angeles to make a deal.

725
00:31:39.346 --> 00:31:41.306
The end of me.

726
00:31:41.348 --> 00:31:42.784
I had no visions
of being with Motown


727
00:31:42.808 --> 00:31:44.643
when I came out with this music.

728
00:31:44.684 --> 00:31:46.496
Matter of fact, Motown was
the last company in the world


729
00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:48.772
that I wanted to be with.

730
00:31:48.814 --> 00:31:51.483
I was riding in the elevator,
and I ran into Jeffrey Bowen,


731
00:31:51.525 --> 00:31:52.960
and he was producing stuff
at Motown,


732
00:31:52.984 --> 00:31:54.528
and he said,
"What are you doing here?"


733
00:31:54.569 --> 00:31:55.630
I said, "Well, I got an album
I just finished.


734
00:31:55.654 --> 00:31:56.780
I'm trying to shop a deal."

735
00:31:56.822 --> 00:31:58.407
He said,
"Well, let me hear it."


736
00:31:58.448 --> 00:32:00.301
- You know, rest was history.
- I ended up signing with them.


737
00:32:00.325 --> 00:32:02.452
My first album
was called Come Get It!


738
00:32:02.494 --> 00:32:04.579
I always come.

739
00:32:04.621 --> 00:32:06.623
It's so much fun, yeah...

740
00:32:06.665 --> 00:32:09.126
He'd been toiling
throughout the 1970s


741
00:32:09.167 --> 00:32:10.585
as a kind of musical journeyman.

742
00:32:10.627 --> 00:32:13.630
It finally clicked in 1978
with Come Get It!


743
00:32:13.672 --> 00:32:15.590
My father thought that.

744
00:32:15.632 --> 00:32:19.386
Rick was a great producer.

745
00:32:19.428 --> 00:32:22.889
And he was just like,
"Man, he's got a sound


746
00:32:22.931 --> 00:32:24.724
that we don't have here."

747
00:32:24.766 --> 00:32:28.437
Motown as a label was trying
to make the transition


748
00:32:28.478 --> 00:32:31.273
from being a conveyor belt
kind of a label,


749
00:32:31.314 --> 00:32:35.652
where they produced and wrote
everything for their artists,


750
00:32:35.694 --> 00:32:38.321
and trying to catch up
with the times.


751
00:32:38.363 --> 00:32:41.825
By '77, people were operating
as artists.


752
00:32:41.867 --> 00:32:43.952
They were writing
their own music.


753
00:32:43.994 --> 00:32:46.163
They were expressing
themselves from the heart,


754
00:32:46.204 --> 00:32:48.665
as opposed to having
songwriters do it for them.


755
00:32:48.707 --> 00:32:51.793
Rick James basically
helps Motown by providing it


756
00:32:51.835 --> 00:32:54.796
with a new economic model
of self-sufficiency.


757
00:32:54.838 --> 00:32:57.966
And that becomes
the Motown model in the 1970s,


758
00:32:58.008 --> 00:33:00.969
and it's one that actually
helps save Motown in an era


759
00:33:01.011 --> 00:33:03.513
of dwindling financial returns
for the company.


760
00:33:03.555 --> 00:33:05.324
"You and I" combines
a lot of different sounds.


761
00:33:05.348 --> 00:33:08.685
I mean, it builds to an intro,
and then there's another intro.


762
00:33:08.727 --> 00:33:10.163
There's... these female vocals
come in.


763
00:33:10.187 --> 00:33:11.521
There's, like, these steps.

764
00:33:13.899 --> 00:33:15.484
Rick loved guitar riffs.

765
00:33:20.155 --> 00:33:21.698
Step three.

766
00:33:21.740 --> 00:33:22.949
Step two.

767
00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:35.921
- Another one.
- That's another one.


768
00:33:36.922 --> 00:33:38.381
There's three intros.

769
00:33:41.885 --> 00:33:43.762
You know, he's adlibbing,
feeling free.


770
00:33:43.803 --> 00:33:45.281
He's not trying to fit
in the formula.


771
00:33:45.305 --> 00:33:48.725
He's giving you some odd sounds
right off the bat.


772
00:33:48.767 --> 00:33:51.061
It's like disco and funk eloped.

773
00:33:51.102 --> 00:33:53.438
This three-part harmony.

774
00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:56.191
Wouldn't you agree?

775
00:33:56.233 --> 00:33:58.944
"You and I"
was one of my favorite songs.


776
00:33:58.985 --> 00:34:00.487
It was my jam.

777
00:34:00.529 --> 00:34:03.365
I liked the lyrics, the melody,

778
00:34:03.406 --> 00:34:06.076
the bassline, the beat.

779
00:34:06.117 --> 00:34:09.079
I still remember just jumping
up and down,


780
00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:11.915
dancing and singing that...
The hook to that song.


781
00:34:11.957 --> 00:34:14.876
Rick understood the demographic

782
00:34:14.918 --> 00:34:16.670
and the psychographic
of the audience


783
00:34:16.711 --> 00:34:18.838
that he was focusing on.

784
00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:20.090
When he says,

785
00:34:20.131 --> 00:34:21.424
Some people must say

786
00:34:21.466 --> 00:34:23.760
I'm infatuated with you.

787
00:34:23.802 --> 00:34:26.930
I don't care, 'cause they
really don't know.


788
00:34:26.972 --> 00:34:30.433
They never hear
or see the things I do.


789
00:34:30.475 --> 00:34:35.355
So far as I'm concerned,
they all can go to hell.


790
00:34:37.899 --> 00:34:41.945
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, oh-oh-oh.

791
00:34:41.987 --> 00:34:44.573
When he says that,

792
00:34:44.614 --> 00:34:47.784
we're like,
"What? He said 'go to hell?'"


793
00:34:47.826 --> 00:34:50.120
And it worked.

794
00:34:50.161 --> 00:34:51.830
Sing it, sugar.

795
00:34:51.871 --> 00:34:55.625
It also gave him a vibe

796
00:34:55.667 --> 00:34:58.503
that no other Motown artist had.

797
00:34:58.545 --> 00:34:59.671
To me, my attitude about it,

798
00:34:59.713 --> 00:35:00.964
it was long incoming.

799
00:35:01.006 --> 00:35:02.966
I was a superstar
in my head already.


800
00:35:03.008 --> 00:35:04.593
I mean, although I wasn't
financially,


801
00:35:04.634 --> 00:35:05.927
my ego at the time was like,

802
00:35:05.969 --> 00:35:07.887
"Yeah, it's about time
for this."


803
00:35:07.929 --> 00:35:11.057
Think about a kid, maybe,
like, 13 or 14 years old,


804
00:35:11.099 --> 00:35:14.144
and we only hit
when we're 30 years old.


805
00:35:14.185 --> 00:35:16.479
It took a whole lot of years
for him to get there.


806
00:35:16.521 --> 00:35:18.148
It was not what you call
an overnight


807
00:35:18.189 --> 00:35:19.649
sensation shit with us.

808
00:35:19.691 --> 00:35:21.234
We had been looking for a break,

809
00:35:21.276 --> 00:35:23.504
and finally got one in life,
and we took advantage of it.


810
00:35:23.528 --> 00:35:26.406
That Come and Get It
album had "You and I" on it,


811
00:35:26.448 --> 00:35:28.283
and it had "Mary Jane" on it.

812
00:35:28.325 --> 00:35:30.744
Now, let's welcome an extremely
gifted young man


813
00:35:30.785 --> 00:35:33.330
who, in less than a year's
time, has a platinum album


814
00:35:33.371 --> 00:35:35.457
and two gold singles
to his credit


815
00:35:35.498 --> 00:35:37.083
on Motown, of course,

816
00:35:37.125 --> 00:35:39.502
and as he joins us to do
one of those smash singles,


817
00:35:39.544 --> 00:35:41.338
how about it, gang,
for Rick James


818
00:35:41.379 --> 00:35:43.173
and the Stone City Band.

819
00:35:43.214 --> 00:35:45.592
I'm in love with Mary Jane.

820
00:35:45.634 --> 00:35:48.053
She's my main thing.

821
00:35:48.094 --> 00:35:50.847
She makes me feel all right.

822
00:35:50.889 --> 00:35:53.558
She makes my heart sing.

823
00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:55.101
I remember hearing Rick James.

824
00:35:55.143 --> 00:35:58.438
First song I ever heard,
I believe, was "Mary Jane."


825
00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:01.399
My friend Ronnie
and his brother Robert...


826
00:36:01.441 --> 00:36:02.651
We called him Ace...

827
00:36:02.692 --> 00:36:04.736
I knew when Ace had to watch us,

828
00:36:04.778 --> 00:36:08.698
we was gonna see
some titty magazines,


829
00:36:08.740 --> 00:36:11.534
we was gonna learn
some dirty words,


830
00:36:11.576 --> 00:36:14.079
we was gonna see him
roll a joint,


831
00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:16.915
and we was gonna hear him
play some Rick James.


832
00:36:16.956 --> 00:36:19.834
I'm in love with Mary Jane

833
00:36:19.876 --> 00:36:21.878
I'm not the only one.

834
00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:25.006
And Mary wanna play around.

835
00:36:25.048 --> 00:36:28.009
I let her have her fun...

836
00:36:28.051 --> 00:36:29.803
When I was young,
I thought it was a song


837
00:36:29.844 --> 00:36:33.390
talking about a pretty girl
that he loved.


838
00:36:33.431 --> 00:36:35.642
Ace taught me, "No.

839
00:36:35.684 --> 00:36:37.852
He talking about weed."

840
00:36:37.894 --> 00:36:40.522
And I'm like, "I be damned.

841
00:36:40.563 --> 00:36:42.357
This man is a genius."

842
00:36:42.399 --> 00:36:45.819
Oh, do ya? Do ya? Do ya?

843
00:36:45.860 --> 00:36:50.365
Now do you think
you love me Mary Jane?


844
00:36:50.407 --> 00:36:52.075
Don't you play no games...

845
00:36:52.117 --> 00:36:54.327
People were trying
to go beyond the boundaries.


846
00:36:54.369 --> 00:36:56.454
They were trying to go
against convention.


847
00:36:56.496 --> 00:37:00.917
It kind of linked up perfectly
with the music he was making.


848
00:37:00.959 --> 00:37:04.087
I mean, this wasn't
Nat King Cole singing ballads.


849
00:37:04.129 --> 00:37:07.549
This was a guy making a song
about smoking weed,


850
00:37:07.590 --> 00:37:09.467
which, back in the late '70s,
was radical.


851
00:37:09.509 --> 00:37:11.928
No one had ever
really heard that before.


852
00:37:11.970 --> 00:37:14.764
And at the time... you know,
it's almost laughable now...


853
00:37:14.806 --> 00:37:18.435
This was just
a very controversial record.


854
00:37:18.476 --> 00:37:21.688
You have this album
from a new artist


855
00:37:21.730 --> 00:37:26.276
who has a totally new
and different persona.


856
00:37:26.317 --> 00:37:28.194
There was a guy
by the name of Skip Miller.


857
00:37:28.236 --> 00:37:29.529
He said, "You know what,

858
00:37:29.571 --> 00:37:32.115
this is one of the first times
that I can say.


859
00:37:32.157 --> 00:37:34.075
I think we have
a Benji record here."


860
00:37:34.117 --> 00:37:35.702
I said,
"What's a Benji record?"


861
00:37:35.744 --> 00:37:37.620
He said, "You know,
remember the dog Benji?"


862
00:37:37.662 --> 00:37:39.789
He said, "This record is so good

863
00:37:39.831 --> 00:37:41.225
that Benji could have
took the record


864
00:37:41.249 --> 00:37:44.294
into the radio station
and got it played."


865
00:37:44.335 --> 00:37:47.756
The main influence I hear in
Rick's music is George Clinton.


866
00:37:50.508 --> 00:37:51.801
Say it like you mean it.

867
00:37:55.847 --> 00:37:57.932
Parliament-Funkadelic
had a focus on creating


868
00:37:57.974 --> 00:38:01.561
these really tight,
funky grooves.


869
00:38:01.603 --> 00:38:03.438
I also hear
Sly and the Family Stone


870
00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:04.749
as a clear influence
in Rick's work.


871
00:38:04.773 --> 00:38:07.734
I want to thank you.

872
00:38:07.776 --> 00:38:11.988
For lettin' me be myself again.

873
00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:15.241
Funk was a bad word
until we made it famous.


874
00:38:15.283 --> 00:38:18.536
Funk is, like,
just the way you feeling.


875
00:38:18.578 --> 00:38:21.414
I mean,
whatever you feeling is funk.


876
00:38:21.456 --> 00:38:26.419
We came out of the A-hole
in between the P-hole.


877
00:38:26.461 --> 00:38:29.130
So if you come from that,
then you funky anyway.


878
00:38:29.172 --> 00:38:34.010
Funk is the modern
interpretation


879
00:38:34.052 --> 00:38:38.515
of our ancestors
screaming through us,


880
00:38:38.556 --> 00:38:43.186
from Africa, through the pain
of slavery, through Jim Crow.


881
00:38:43.228 --> 00:38:45.647
It's Black excellence,
and it's nigga shit.


882
00:38:45.688 --> 00:38:47.690
The worst made beautiful.

883
00:38:47.732 --> 00:38:52.111
The lowest given
the opportunity to express.


884
00:38:52.153 --> 00:38:54.197
Shit, Rick James is

885
00:38:54.239 --> 00:38:57.367
an amazing expression
of all of that.


886
00:38:57.408 --> 00:38:59.202
Tonight, Rock Concert presents

887
00:38:59.244 --> 00:39:00.787
the Pied Piper of funk fun...

888
00:39:00.829 --> 00:39:02.288
Oh, "punk funk," I'm sorry.

889
00:39:02.330 --> 00:39:03.540
204. Take two.

890
00:39:03.581 --> 00:39:04.874
Tonight, Rock Concert presents

891
00:39:04.916 --> 00:39:08.127
the Pied Piper
of punk funk, Rick James.


892
00:39:08.169 --> 00:39:11.881
We're bustin' out
of this L-Seven square.


893
00:39:11.923 --> 00:39:13.967
Freaks like you and I.

894
00:39:14.008 --> 00:39:16.886
Could never funk from there.

895
00:39:16.928 --> 00:39:18.638
I remember
listening to Rick James'


896
00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:20.223
music when I was a kid.

897
00:39:20.265 --> 00:39:23.434
Bustin' Out was probably
one of my favorites.


898
00:39:23.476 --> 00:39:25.895
Heavy bassline-driven grooves,

899
00:39:25.937 --> 00:39:28.481
and Rick was just
wilding on the songs.


900
00:39:28.523 --> 00:39:30.650
Just spitting it raw.

901
00:39:30.692 --> 00:39:32.777
Put your hands in the air.

902
00:39:32.819 --> 00:39:35.071
And sing along with me.

903
00:39:35.113 --> 00:39:36.406
Bustin' out!

904
00:39:36.447 --> 00:39:38.324
Rick James' style of funk

905
00:39:38.366 --> 00:39:41.411
wasn't like the GAP Band,

906
00:39:41.452 --> 00:39:44.414
Con Funk Shun, Ohio Players.

907
00:39:44.455 --> 00:39:46.583
His style was just hard.

908
00:39:46.624 --> 00:39:49.252
He was creating
a really rhythmic, aggressive,


909
00:39:49.294 --> 00:39:51.421
hard-driving Black dance music.

910
00:39:51.462 --> 00:39:55.258
Rick James' grooves
were groovier than most.


911
00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:58.344
The way that they hit
on the one,


912
00:39:58.386 --> 00:40:01.556
meaning on the first beat
of every measure,


913
00:40:01.598 --> 00:40:04.767
meant that they caused
a kind of energetic response.


914
00:40:04.809 --> 00:40:06.936
Every time you come
to that first melody... uh.


915
00:40:09.814 --> 00:40:11.941
The Rick James sound

916
00:40:11.983 --> 00:40:14.235
was basically
like a funk grenade.


917
00:40:14.277 --> 00:40:15.737
He named it punk funk.

918
00:40:15.778 --> 00:40:17.071
Rick wanted to me a rocker,

919
00:40:17.113 --> 00:40:18.615
and then he came from Buffalo,

920
00:40:18.656 --> 00:40:20.617
and, you know, we have
a different kind of style,


921
00:40:20.658 --> 00:40:22.118
you know, our genre is funk,

922
00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:23.745
but it's a different
kind of funk.


923
00:40:23.786 --> 00:40:25.121
You're doing jazz.

924
00:40:25.163 --> 00:40:28.291
You're doing hard rock
with guitars.


925
00:40:28.333 --> 00:40:30.460
You're doing big band music,
with the horns.


926
00:40:30.501 --> 00:40:33.171
The punk part was punk from,
like, Europe.


927
00:40:33.212 --> 00:40:35.590
He was equating the poor kids
over in England


928
00:40:35.632 --> 00:40:37.818
with the poor kids here in
the neighborhoods in Buffalo.


929
00:40:37.842 --> 00:40:39.302
Punk funk was the attitude.

930
00:40:39.344 --> 00:40:40.946
"We're gonna do what the hell
we want to do."


931
00:40:40.970 --> 00:40:42.656
It gave me a vehicle
to write about anything.


932
00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:44.098
I wanted to write about.

933
00:40:44.140 --> 00:40:45.534
You know, I smoke marijuana,
I can write about it.


934
00:40:45.558 --> 00:40:47.578
If I don't like Richard Nixon,
I can call him an asshole.


935
00:40:47.602 --> 00:40:51.064
To be able to finally have
Blacks write about whatever,


936
00:40:51.105 --> 00:40:53.983
and be able to wear whatever...

937
00:40:54.025 --> 00:40:56.653
Because for so long,
Blacks have been stigmatized


938
00:40:56.694 --> 00:40:59.614
into this choreographed...

939
00:40:59.656 --> 00:41:01.449
Doo wop, doo wah.

940
00:41:01.491 --> 00:41:02.825
I love you.

941
00:41:02.867 --> 00:41:06.412
Ooh, do, do, do, do
You know, eh.


942
00:41:06.454 --> 00:41:09.666
And I remember asking Rick,
"Man, what are you gonna do


943
00:41:09.707 --> 00:41:12.627
- if this thing is a success?
- What are you going to...


944
00:41:12.669 --> 00:41:14.963
What are you gonna do
with your money, for instance?"


945
00:41:15.004 --> 00:41:16.965
"Oh, Steve, ain't nothing
gonna change, man.


946
00:41:17.006 --> 00:41:19.092
I'm just gonna buy some more
clothes or something."


947
00:41:19.133 --> 00:41:22.887
But things did change,
and they changed rapidly.


948
00:41:22.929 --> 00:41:25.139
The hustling energy
is an energy.


949
00:41:25.181 --> 00:41:28.518
And that energy...
Once you get through


950
00:41:28.559 --> 00:41:31.020
with your non-musical hustle,
whatever it is,


951
00:41:31.062 --> 00:41:33.523
that energy
is still there in the music.


952
00:41:33.564 --> 00:41:37.360
You can feel that intensity
in his music.


953
00:41:37.402 --> 00:41:38.528
It's aspirational.

954
00:41:38.569 --> 00:41:42.323
- He aspires to get over.
- It's America.


955
00:41:42.365 --> 00:41:44.492
I had a double platinum
album on my hands,


956
00:41:44.534 --> 00:41:46.411
and then I needed a group,
so I went home,


957
00:41:46.452 --> 00:41:49.372
and I put together my favorite
musicians in that town,


958
00:41:49.414 --> 00:41:51.749
who became my family for
years... the Stone City Band.


959
00:41:51.791 --> 00:41:53.227
Do you want
to present everybody to us?


960
00:41:53.251 --> 00:41:54.335
Sure.

961
00:41:54.377 --> 00:41:55.396
'Cause you know them
better than I do.


962
00:41:55.420 --> 00:41:57.296
This light-skinned fellow.

963
00:41:57.338 --> 00:41:59.382
This is Tom McDermott,
guitar player.


964
00:41:59.424 --> 00:42:00.675
That's Hughes.

965
00:42:00.717 --> 00:42:01.801
- Drummer.
- How you doing?


966
00:42:01.843 --> 00:42:03.136
This is Joanne McDuffie.

967
00:42:03.177 --> 00:42:05.054
We call her JoJo for short.

968
00:42:05.096 --> 00:42:06.222
One of the girl singers.

969
00:42:06.264 --> 00:42:07.366
- This is Levi Ruffin.
- How you doing?


970
00:42:07.390 --> 00:42:09.183
We're the Stone City Band.

971
00:42:09.225 --> 00:42:11.811
This is Lisa Sarna,
one of the girl singers.


972
00:42:11.853 --> 00:42:14.564
That's Oscar Alston,
Alexander Monday.


973
00:42:16.441 --> 00:42:18.067
That's our bass player.

974
00:42:18.109 --> 00:42:20.194
Rick came up and asked me,
"Man, who's jamming now?"


975
00:42:20.236 --> 00:42:21.880
And I said, "As far as, like,
the groove's concerned,


976
00:42:21.904 --> 00:42:24.032
it's still George Clinton
and Bootsy."


977
00:42:24.073 --> 00:42:25.241
And he told me, man, I quote,

978
00:42:25.283 --> 00:42:26.617
"Man, we can do
better than that."


979
00:42:26.659 --> 00:42:28.619
I said, "Shit. Sign me up."

980
00:42:28.661 --> 00:42:31.581
We did our first
rehearsals at Rick house.


981
00:42:31.622 --> 00:42:33.708
He had some songs
that he wanted to do.


982
00:42:33.750 --> 00:42:37.795
- So we went to the studio.
- We recorded the demos.


983
00:42:37.837 --> 00:42:40.048
Rick took them back to Motown.

984
00:42:40.089 --> 00:42:42.258
Berry Gordy told Rick... he said,

985
00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:45.595
"Whoever those musicians are,
that's your band."


986
00:42:45.636 --> 00:42:46.929
Rick could write.

987
00:42:46.971 --> 00:42:49.057
He wasn't
a great pianist or bass,


988
00:42:49.098 --> 00:42:50.933
but he knew what he liked

989
00:42:50.975 --> 00:42:54.145
and what would work
and fit together.


990
00:42:54.187 --> 00:42:56.147
So when he had all of us around,

991
00:42:56.189 --> 00:42:59.734
that's like having
all of the notes on the piano,


992
00:42:59.776 --> 00:43:01.569
all of the notes on the bass.

993
00:43:01.611 --> 00:43:03.529
Chemistry was like new,
because none of us


994
00:43:03.571 --> 00:43:05.239
really had played
together in the studio.


995
00:43:05.281 --> 00:43:07.075
I knew what we was supposed
to sound like.


996
00:43:07.116 --> 00:43:08.385
I just didn't know
how to make it.


997
00:43:08.409 --> 00:43:10.411
Rick showed us how to make it.

998
00:43:10.453 --> 00:43:12.139
He wanted us to see
everything he was doing.


999
00:43:12.163 --> 00:43:13.539
I guess he was figuring,
you know,


1000
00:43:13.581 --> 00:43:15.392
- "- One day I might not be here.
- Maybe I can't do it.


1001
00:43:15.416 --> 00:43:16.976
Y'all can still carry on
with the shit."


1002
00:43:17.001 --> 00:43:18.878
All-points bulletin:

1003
00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:21.089
Be on the lookout
for Rick James.


1004
00:43:21.130 --> 00:43:23.466
Rick James
and the Stone City Band.


1005
00:43:23.508 --> 00:43:24.801
They're bustin' out.

1006
00:43:27.178 --> 00:43:28.638
I was staying with my mom.

1007
00:43:28.679 --> 00:43:31.307
Rick said, "We're all gonna
have to get braids."


1008
00:43:31.349 --> 00:43:34.519
- "- Braids? Are you kidding.
- My mama's gonna kill me."


1009
00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:37.021
He said, "If you want to be
a part of this band,


1010
00:43:37.063 --> 00:43:39.315
you have to get your braids."

1011
00:43:39.357 --> 00:43:40.858
I had, like, this short Afro,

1012
00:43:40.900 --> 00:43:42.443
you know,
and I didn't want that.


1013
00:43:42.485 --> 00:43:44.004
You know, I didn't wanna look
like everybody else.


1014
00:43:44.028 --> 00:43:46.614
And the Beatles had made such
a tremendous effect on me


1015
00:43:46.656 --> 00:43:48.157
with the Beatle haircut.

1016
00:43:48.199 --> 00:43:50.159
So I ran into this
African woman on an airplane,


1017
00:43:50.201 --> 00:43:53.121
she was from the Masai,
and I saw her hair.


1018
00:43:53.162 --> 00:43:55.248
I said, "God, that's fantastic.

1019
00:43:55.289 --> 00:43:57.101
How do you do that?"
and she showed me these books


1020
00:43:57.125 --> 00:43:59.961
of Africans
with their short hair,


1021
00:44:00.002 --> 00:44:02.839
and then she showed me some
pictures after they finished


1022
00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:04.382
doing what they did,
their magic.


1023
00:44:04.423 --> 00:44:06.134
I said,
"Can you do this for me?"


1024
00:44:06.175 --> 00:44:07.611
And she said, "Yeah."
I said, "There it is. Bam.


1025
00:44:07.635 --> 00:44:09.345
- That's the vision.
- That's what I want."


1026
00:44:09.387 --> 00:44:10.596
Bustin' out!

1027
00:44:10.638 --> 00:44:12.098
We're bustin' out.

1028
00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:13.516
I had beads
and everything in mine.


1029
00:44:13.558 --> 00:44:15.434
Everybody thought
we was fucking crazy.


1030
00:44:15.476 --> 00:44:16.954
Next thing you know,
all the brothers,


1031
00:44:16.978 --> 00:44:18.205
they started wearing this shit.

1032
00:44:18.229 --> 00:44:20.481
He wanted everybody
to put glitter on,


1033
00:44:20.523 --> 00:44:23.484
you know, their hair,
and it'd be in your suitcase


1034
00:44:23.526 --> 00:44:25.611
for, like, six months
after the tour, you know.


1035
00:44:25.653 --> 00:44:27.697
Rick would pour all
that stuff in your hair, man.


1036
00:44:27.738 --> 00:44:30.950
It was like, man, you know,
I be ready to fight.


1037
00:44:30.992 --> 00:44:32.535
He wanted us to look like

1038
00:44:32.577 --> 00:44:34.620
we were ready
to take care of business,


1039
00:44:34.662 --> 00:44:36.497
and that's what we did,
every night.


1040
00:44:36.539 --> 00:44:38.624
I mean, for me,
I couldn't fuck with it.


1041
00:44:39.750 --> 00:44:41.752
Rick James had a style that

1042
00:44:41.794 --> 00:44:46.048
kind of reminded you
of David Bowie, Kiss.


1043
00:44:46.090 --> 00:44:49.886
It was Black, it was rock,
but it was kinda avant-garde,


1044
00:44:49.927 --> 00:44:52.722
in terms
of Black culture, for sure.


1045
00:44:52.763 --> 00:44:55.391
Look at you.

1046
00:44:55.433 --> 00:44:58.060
Mary Jane.

1047
00:44:59.478 --> 00:45:02.857
Rick sees
George Clinton's showmanship,


1048
00:45:02.899 --> 00:45:05.610
and he realizes that,

1049
00:45:05.651 --> 00:45:08.863
just as George became
the purple-haired crazy man,


1050
00:45:08.905 --> 00:45:13.075
he's gonna have to come up
with his show identity.


1051
00:45:13.117 --> 00:45:15.661
Where's the ganja tonight?

1052
00:45:15.703 --> 00:45:19.749
Weed became
a signature part of his act.


1053
00:45:19.790 --> 00:45:22.710
You know,
the giant joint on stage.


1054
00:45:22.752 --> 00:45:25.254
They would tell us
at sound check,


1055
00:45:25.296 --> 00:45:27.006
"You cannot smoke."

1056
00:45:27.048 --> 00:45:30.176
Rick said,
"We're smoking anyway."


1057
00:45:30.218 --> 00:45:33.262
So on stage,
he would light it up,


1058
00:45:33.304 --> 00:45:35.097
and he would tell the audience,

1059
00:45:35.139 --> 00:45:37.350
"If the police bother me,

1060
00:45:37.391 --> 00:45:39.936
you all tear
this mother sucker up."


1061
00:45:41.646 --> 00:45:45.441
P-Funk, Parliament,
Bootsy, all these people,


1062
00:45:45.483 --> 00:45:48.486
they were kinda
looking at Rick sideways,


1063
00:45:48.527 --> 00:45:53.366
because he had learned
how to craft pop with funk,


1064
00:45:53.407 --> 00:45:57.411
and so he hit the big time
faster than they did.


1065
00:45:57.453 --> 00:46:00.122
Rick was the smartest
one out of all of us.


1066
00:46:00.164 --> 00:46:03.167
- He sold a lot of records.
- People came to the concerts.


1067
00:46:03.209 --> 00:46:04.794
And, you know,
he used to talk about,


1068
00:46:04.835 --> 00:46:06.754
"Yeah, I'm selling
more records than y'all."


1069
00:46:06.796 --> 00:46:09.632
I think George took offense
a little bit.


1070
00:46:09.674 --> 00:46:13.803
But all was fair
in funk and war, man.


1071
00:46:18.349 --> 00:46:20.309
The first tour was amazing.

1072
00:46:20.351 --> 00:46:22.770
We'd be going out six,
seven months.


1073
00:46:22.812 --> 00:46:24.981
We hit every place in America,
it seemed like.


1074
00:46:25.022 --> 00:46:29.068
LA Coliseum, July 1979.

1075
00:46:29.110 --> 00:46:30.611
Greatest Funk Festival.

1076
00:46:39.328 --> 00:46:41.747
There was over

1077
00:46:41.789 --> 00:46:42.999
In the audience.

1078
00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:44.792
And they was chanting our name,

1079
00:46:44.834 --> 00:46:46.627
screaming and hollering.

1080
00:46:46.669 --> 00:46:48.796
And that made me feel real good,

1081
00:46:48.838 --> 00:46:51.007
and I was saying, "We did it."

1082
00:46:57.388 --> 00:46:58.556
He was a showman.

1083
00:46:58.597 --> 00:47:00.141
From the time he walked on stage

1084
00:47:00.182 --> 00:47:01.809
to the time he walked off,

1085
00:47:01.851 --> 00:47:04.645
he was in it to give everything
that he felt about the music


1086
00:47:04.687 --> 00:47:06.355
and throw that out
to the audience.


1087
00:47:06.397 --> 00:47:07.231
Sing!

1088
00:47:07.273 --> 00:47:09.150
I'm in the beach house.

1089
00:47:09.191 --> 00:47:10.776
Life on the road with Rick James

1090
00:47:10.818 --> 00:47:12.486
and the Stone City Band

1091
00:47:12.528 --> 00:47:17.241
was tumultuous,
high energy, never-ending.


1092
00:47:17.283 --> 00:47:20.828
One of the most fun nights
of my life


1093
00:47:20.870 --> 00:47:22.371
was jamming with him

1094
00:47:22.413 --> 00:47:25.333
at Giants Stadium
here in New York.


1095
00:47:25.374 --> 00:47:30.129
I guess we were of the mindset
that we were so free,


1096
00:47:30.171 --> 00:47:32.298
we could just really
do anything we want.


1097
00:47:32.340 --> 00:47:34.008
I don't even know
what we played,


1098
00:47:34.050 --> 00:47:36.844
but I remember going out there
with Rick and just jamming,


1099
00:47:36.886 --> 00:47:38.971
and just doing
whatever the hell we wanted,


1100
00:47:39.013 --> 00:47:40.848
and the crowd went bananas.

1101
00:47:40.890 --> 00:47:42.641
I mean, it was incredible.

1102
00:47:42.683 --> 00:47:44.185
It was just, like,
pedal to the metal.


1103
00:47:44.226 --> 00:47:46.020
We just bump and groove,

1104
00:47:46.062 --> 00:47:49.065
and there was pyrotechnics,
you know, and theatrics.


1105
00:47:49.106 --> 00:47:51.192
We had dancers.

1106
00:47:51.233 --> 00:47:53.944
The pyrotechnics
was really a lot, you know.


1107
00:47:53.986 --> 00:47:55.112
Sometimes it would go off,

1108
00:47:55.154 --> 00:47:56.340
and you'd be, like,
shell-shocked.


1109
00:47:56.364 --> 00:47:58.074
Bam!

1110
00:47:58.115 --> 00:47:59.617
Your ears would be ringing.

1111
00:47:59.658 --> 00:48:04.497
The band, the girls, Rick,
the crew... we were family.


1112
00:48:04.538 --> 00:48:06.624
We toured all over the country.

1113
00:48:06.665 --> 00:48:09.377
Throwing money up in the air
in pillowcases.


1114
00:48:09.418 --> 00:48:11.712
You ate at the best restaurants.

1115
00:48:11.754 --> 00:48:13.714
Christmas time, bonuses.

1116
00:48:13.756 --> 00:48:16.258
- "- Let's go.
- Let's take a Learjet.


1117
00:48:16.300 --> 00:48:19.053
- Let's take a helicopter.
- Let's go to New York."


1118
00:48:19.095 --> 00:48:20.888
Just anything he wanted to do.

1119
00:48:20.930 --> 00:48:23.641
Most of us are from Buffalo,
and we moved to LA.


1120
00:48:23.682 --> 00:48:25.285
We were living in
Randolph Hearst's mansion.


1121
00:48:25.309 --> 00:48:26.936
I mean, we were, like,
living big time.


1122
00:48:26.977 --> 00:48:29.480
I brought all these guys out,
my homeboys from the ghetto.


1123
00:48:29.522 --> 00:48:31.565
Coming from Buffalo,
New York to LA


1124
00:48:31.607 --> 00:48:34.777
was an extreme
culture shock to me.


1125
00:48:34.819 --> 00:48:36.112
That was beautiful, man,

1126
00:48:36.153 --> 00:48:37.863
up in the canyons...
Coldwater Canyon.


1127
00:48:37.905 --> 00:48:40.950
I walked in there and said,
"I... damn."


1128
00:48:40.991 --> 00:48:42.618
I said, "This is living."

1129
00:48:42.660 --> 00:48:45.955
I mean, the house was so big,
you rarely ran into each other.


1130
00:48:47.456 --> 00:48:50.793
You had to get on the intercom
to find somebody.


1131
00:48:50.835 --> 00:48:53.337
There was some stupid
shit going on out there.


1132
00:48:53.379 --> 00:48:55.506
There was plenty of dope around.

1133
00:48:55.548 --> 00:48:57.800
Freaky women, all kinds
of different narcotics.


1134
00:48:57.842 --> 00:49:00.219
I think I snorted everything
on God's planet earth


1135
00:49:00.261 --> 00:49:01.137
when I was in the band.

1136
00:49:01.178 --> 00:49:03.597
Drugs. Rock and roll. Women.

1137
00:49:03.639 --> 00:49:05.850
It was all part
of the same package.


1138
00:49:05.891 --> 00:49:07.393
That was Rick.

1139
00:49:07.435 --> 00:49:09.895
I mean, he did that
before he even got famous.


1140
00:49:09.937 --> 00:49:11.230
He partied.

1141
00:49:11.272 --> 00:49:12.857
Plus he liked
to be around people.


1142
00:49:12.898 --> 00:49:14.900
And those days
was wild and crazy.


1143
00:49:14.942 --> 00:49:16.294
I mean, we were
fucking all standing


1144
00:49:16.318 --> 00:49:17.796
on the verge of insanity
in those days.


1145
00:49:17.820 --> 00:49:19.321
Everybody was snorting cocaine,

1146
00:49:19.363 --> 00:49:21.740
and everybody
was taking quaaludes,


1147
00:49:21.782 --> 00:49:24.702
drinking Cristal
and Dom Pérignon champagne,


1148
00:49:24.743 --> 00:49:28.122
and getting butt naked
and doing it in the bathrooms.


1149
00:49:28.164 --> 00:49:29.123
It was wonderful.

1150
00:49:29.165 --> 00:49:30.708
Girls love girls,

1151
00:49:30.749 --> 00:49:32.334
and I don't know
what guys were doing.


1152
00:49:32.376 --> 00:49:35.129
Personally, I was loving women
very, very hard them days.


1153
00:49:35.171 --> 00:49:37.965
I got a lot of inspiration
from women in those days.


1154
00:49:38.007 --> 00:49:40.342
There was a girl,
we had the video camera,


1155
00:49:40.384 --> 00:49:42.803
and her and I
were engaged sexually,


1156
00:49:42.845 --> 00:49:47.349
and Rick was behind the camera,
you know, taping us.


1157
00:49:47.391 --> 00:49:50.853
So at one point,

1158
00:49:50.895 --> 00:49:53.522
Rick just, you know,
took off his belt...


1159
00:49:53.564 --> 00:49:57.860
Had the belt... and the girl
was on top of me,


1160
00:49:57.902 --> 00:50:02.656
and he started hitting the girl
on her behind with the strap.


1161
00:50:02.698 --> 00:50:04.384
And I'm thinking,
"Oh, these are just love taps.


1162
00:50:04.408 --> 00:50:05.951
You know, no big thing."

1163
00:50:05.993 --> 00:50:09.330
Until one time, the belt
slipped off of her behind


1164
00:50:09.371 --> 00:50:12.166
and hit me on the leg,
and it hurt it.


1165
00:50:12.208 --> 00:50:17.213
And I, you know, hollered out,
but I saw on her body


1166
00:50:17.254 --> 00:50:21.717
these red marks from the belt
hitting her behind.


1167
00:50:21.759 --> 00:50:24.845
If you gave him that space,
if you allowed him to do...


1168
00:50:24.887 --> 00:50:29.266
He would take
that opportunity and do it.


1169
00:50:29.308 --> 00:50:31.519
He did everything to women

1170
00:50:31.560 --> 00:50:34.063
to see
what they could withstand,


1171
00:50:34.104 --> 00:50:38.526
see what would make them say,
"Oh no. I'm not gonna do that."


1172
00:50:38.567 --> 00:50:40.736
The more they agreed to,

1173
00:50:40.778 --> 00:50:43.072
the more upset
he became with them.


1174
00:50:43.113 --> 00:50:47.493
He treated women the way that
rock and rollers treated women.


1175
00:50:47.535 --> 00:50:50.496
His sexual exploits were more,

1176
00:50:50.538 --> 00:50:53.249
- "- You do that to that person.
- Let me watch.


1177
00:50:53.290 --> 00:50:55.751
I want to orchestrate
some shit over here."


1178
00:50:55.793 --> 00:50:57.711
He wasn't personally involved.

1179
00:50:57.753 --> 00:50:59.713
He was not
that kind of "super freak."


1180
00:50:59.755 --> 00:51:02.258
He didn't let people touch him.

1181
00:51:02.299 --> 00:51:04.176
He wasn't, like, in the orgy.

1182
00:51:04.218 --> 00:51:05.761
He would watch the orgy.

1183
00:51:05.803 --> 00:51:08.264
It was not
a personal thing for him.


1184
00:51:08.305 --> 00:51:10.891
If he was gonna be sexual,

1185
00:51:10.933 --> 00:51:12.434
it was with somebody he trusted,

1186
00:51:12.476 --> 00:51:14.103
and he trusted no one.

1187
00:51:15.729 --> 00:51:17.439
He had broads, man,
chasing our limos


1188
00:51:17.481 --> 00:51:20.192
down the street and shit,
man, throwing panties on stage


1189
00:51:20.234 --> 00:51:21.610
and all kinds of stupid shit.

1190
00:51:21.652 --> 00:51:23.946
And that shit was funny to me,
but it was fun.


1191
00:51:23.988 --> 00:51:26.782
That's what you dreamed of
when you were growing up.


1192
00:51:26.824 --> 00:51:28.951
I would say that
part of his persona


1193
00:51:28.993 --> 00:51:31.996
was the bad boy,
living on the dangerous side,


1194
00:51:32.037 --> 00:51:34.748
running around
with the different women,


1195
00:51:34.790 --> 00:51:38.168
the drugs, the whole
bigger-than-life picture


1196
00:51:38.210 --> 00:51:39.795
that he painted.

1197
00:51:39.837 --> 00:51:42.965
On stage and in his
lyrics and in his music,


1198
00:51:43.007 --> 00:51:47.511
he was portraying this
sexual bravado and machismo.


1199
00:51:47.553 --> 00:51:49.763
Off stage, we now know

1200
00:51:49.805 --> 00:51:51.974
that what was underwriting
that machismo


1201
00:51:52.016 --> 00:51:54.560
and that bravado was
very disturbing,


1202
00:51:54.602 --> 00:51:56.854
very dark, and abusive.

1203
00:52:05.946 --> 00:52:08.657
Rick essentially has
a run of nine albums


1204
00:52:08.699 --> 00:52:11.493
in six, seven years...
Come Get it!


1205
00:52:11.535 --> 00:52:13.495
Bustin' Out of I Seven,
Fire It Up.


1206
00:52:13.537 --> 00:52:15.181
- Bam, bam, bam, bam.
- He's got all these hits.


1207
00:52:15.205 --> 00:52:17.625
I used to sit there
and watch him write.


1208
00:52:17.666 --> 00:52:20.502
- Incredible speed.
- He would just... my God.


1209
00:52:20.544 --> 00:52:22.838
Next thing you know, you got
a hit record right there.


1210
00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:25.424
He was making records
and making music


1211
00:52:25.466 --> 00:52:28.344
and making money,
but he was leveling off.


1212
00:52:28.385 --> 00:52:30.012
People were still into Rick,

1213
00:52:30.054 --> 00:52:32.723
but we were waiting
on something else.


1214
00:52:32.765 --> 00:52:34.683
And then came Street Songs.

1215
00:52:34.725 --> 00:52:37.811
- First, there was rock.
- Then there was hard rock.


1216
00:52:37.853 --> 00:52:39.855
Then there was punk rock.

1217
00:52:39.897 --> 00:52:42.691
And now, thanks to...
Mainly to our next performer,


1218
00:52:42.733 --> 00:52:44.193
there's punk funk.

1219
00:52:44.234 --> 00:52:48.656
Here he is, the Pied Piper
of Funk, Mr. Rick James.


1220
00:52:56.163 --> 00:52:57.706
Street Songs spoke of things

1221
00:52:57.748 --> 00:52:58.767
that happened in the ghetto.

1222
00:52:58.791 --> 00:53:00.209
It talks
about very real subjects


1223
00:53:00.250 --> 00:53:01.543
and very real things.

1224
00:53:01.585 --> 00:53:03.295
You know, Black people made me.

1225
00:53:03.337 --> 00:53:04.880
Black people bought tickets

1226
00:53:04.922 --> 00:53:06.965
and sold out concerts
and stadiums.


1227
00:53:07.007 --> 00:53:10.219
So it was a conscious attempt
on my part


1228
00:53:10.260 --> 00:53:12.680
to get back to the roots
of what I'm all about.


1229
00:53:12.721 --> 00:53:14.973
When I came home last night.

1230
00:53:18.102 --> 00:53:21.522
You wouldn't make love to me...

1231
00:53:21.563 --> 00:53:23.148
Rick James had to come back

1232
00:53:23.190 --> 00:53:27.486
to Buffalo, New York,
to feel the vibe of everybody,


1233
00:53:27.528 --> 00:53:30.864
what was going on
at that particular time.


1234
00:53:34.118 --> 00:53:36.286
Out all night just dancing...

1235
00:53:36.328 --> 00:53:39.289
This is the album that
everybody's talking about


1236
00:53:39.331 --> 00:53:40.582
and everybody is buying.

1237
00:53:40.624 --> 00:53:42.418
And triple platinum.

1238
00:53:42.459 --> 00:53:44.086
Your sales are just setting

1239
00:53:44.128 --> 00:53:45.879
new records
in the recording industry.


1240
00:53:45.921 --> 00:53:48.090
What are you gonna do
with all that money, Rick?


1241
00:53:48.132 --> 00:53:50.217
Going to invest it
in making more money.


1242
00:53:50.259 --> 00:53:51.552
Are you?-

1243
00:53:51.593 --> 00:53:53.053
Street Songs in 1981

1244
00:53:53.095 --> 00:53:54.430
takes him
to a whole other level.


1245
00:53:54.471 --> 00:53:57.266
Street Songs is a concept album

1246
00:53:57.307 --> 00:54:00.686
that is very much rooted
around his childhood experience


1247
00:54:00.728 --> 00:54:02.187
growing up in Buffalo,

1248
00:54:02.229 --> 00:54:05.065
and his focus on the issues
that informed him


1249
00:54:05.107 --> 00:54:06.584
and informed Black communities
at the time.


1250
00:54:06.608 --> 00:54:08.444
When I was a young boy.

1251
00:54:08.485 --> 00:54:10.571
Growing up in the ghetto.

1252
00:54:10.612 --> 00:54:12.573
Hanging out on corners.

1253
00:54:12.614 --> 00:54:14.450
Singing with the fellas...

1254
00:54:14.491 --> 00:54:16.243
"Ghetto Life"
could be a hip hop song.


1255
00:54:16.285 --> 00:54:19.538
The scene he's describing
is sort of, you know,


1256
00:54:19.580 --> 00:54:22.040
Black America
at a particular point,


1257
00:54:22.082 --> 00:54:25.461
from a class perspective,
talking about pimp game,


1258
00:54:25.502 --> 00:54:28.130
the dope game, police brutality.

1259
00:54:28.172 --> 00:54:31.800
"Mr. Policeman" came out
years before "Fuck tha Police."


1260
00:54:31.842 --> 00:54:35.095
Hey, Mr. Policeman

1261
00:54:35.137 --> 00:54:38.223
I've seen you
in my neighborhood.


1262
00:54:38.265 --> 00:54:41.477
You look to me
you'll do no good.


1263
00:54:41.518 --> 00:54:44.646
And it's basically
saying the same thing.


1264
00:54:44.688 --> 00:54:46.148
I remember, like,

1265
00:54:46.190 --> 00:54:48.817
listening to it over
and over and over again.


1266
00:54:48.859 --> 00:54:50.986
It's probably his best album.

1267
00:54:51.028 --> 00:54:53.363
It all really came together
on Street Songs,


1268
00:54:53.405 --> 00:54:57.326
and you understood him
to be a concept R&B artist,


1269
00:54:57.367 --> 00:54:59.620
not just a kind of hired hand.

1270
00:55:02.331 --> 00:55:03.707
So this is bare bones.

1271
00:55:03.749 --> 00:55:05.334
Rhythm section
and some guitar riffs.


1272
00:55:09.671 --> 00:55:11.548
Master of the hand claps.

1273
00:55:13.300 --> 00:55:15.177
Give it to me, baby.

1274
00:55:15.803 --> 00:55:17.513
It's great to be able
to break it apart


1275
00:55:17.554 --> 00:55:19.264
and enjoy the pieces.

1276
00:55:19.306 --> 00:55:20.492
You know, we love it
when it's all together.


1277
00:55:20.516 --> 00:55:21.683
Like, we were just grooving

1278
00:55:21.725 --> 00:55:23.325
when you get the bass
and drums together.


1279
00:55:27.356 --> 00:55:29.358
All right, I hear
your fingers wearing out.


1280
00:55:29.399 --> 00:55:30.651
I hear 'em wearing out.

1281
00:55:30.692 --> 00:55:32.132
I hear the motherfuckers
wearing out.


1282
00:55:33.737 --> 00:55:37.658
"Super Freak."

1283
00:55:37.699 --> 00:55:38.992
I hate "Super Freak."

1284
00:55:42.913 --> 00:55:43.789
Well, it's really funny.

1285
00:55:43.831 --> 00:55:44.873
That was the last song

1286
00:55:44.915 --> 00:55:46.542
that he recorded on the album,

1287
00:55:46.583 --> 00:55:49.920
and he didn't have anything
that he felt was pop,


1288
00:55:49.962 --> 00:55:51.713
and he just started
humming this thing.


1289
00:55:53.799 --> 00:55:55.717
Every time it would come on

1290
00:55:55.759 --> 00:55:57.427
in an arena that we was at,

1291
00:55:57.469 --> 00:55:59.888
the people acted a fool.

1292
00:55:59.930 --> 00:56:02.182
They went crazy over it.

1293
00:56:02.224 --> 00:56:04.852
'Cause we was playing
that song early in the night.


1294
00:56:04.893 --> 00:56:07.563
It was so big,
we had to make that


1295
00:56:07.604 --> 00:56:08.772
the last tune of the night.

1296
00:56:08.814 --> 00:56:11.984
She's a very kinky girl.

1297
00:56:12.025 --> 00:56:15.863
The kind you don't
take home to mother.


1298
00:56:15.904 --> 00:56:19.199
And she will never
let your spirit down.


1299
00:56:19.241 --> 00:56:22.411
Once you get her off the street.

1300
00:56:22.452 --> 00:56:25.497
She likes the boys in the band.

1301
00:56:25.539 --> 00:56:27.749
"Super Freak"
was just... it was a parody.


1302
00:56:27.791 --> 00:56:29.084
It was just a fucking joke.

1303
00:56:29.126 --> 00:56:31.169
You know, girls trying
to seduce you.


1304
00:56:31.211 --> 00:56:32.880
You know, I was with girls
who thought...


1305
00:56:32.921 --> 00:56:34.756
Whatever...
Candle lights and incense


1306
00:56:34.798 --> 00:56:38.510
and ménage à trois
and 714 quaaludes.


1307
00:56:38.552 --> 00:56:39.887
It was right on time.

1308
00:56:39.928 --> 00:56:42.848
I mean, "Super Freak"
was everywhere, you know?


1309
00:56:42.890 --> 00:56:44.558
Rick just called it out.

1310
00:56:44.600 --> 00:56:46.018
That girl is pretty kinky.

1311
00:56:46.059 --> 00:56:47.769
The girl's a super freak.

1312
00:56:47.811 --> 00:56:49.104
And I think it was good

1313
00:56:49.146 --> 00:56:51.773
because they felt good
about coming out.


1314
00:56:51.815 --> 00:56:53.108
Rick knew what he was doing.

1315
00:56:53.150 --> 00:56:56.028
I hate the fact
that it became so popular.


1316
00:56:56.069 --> 00:56:58.989
There were a lot of people
who had no idea


1317
00:56:59.031 --> 00:57:01.825
what Rick was about,
who heard that song,


1318
00:57:01.867 --> 00:57:03.952
and embraced it

1319
00:57:03.994 --> 00:57:07.915
separate from the rest
of his body of work.


1320
00:57:07.956 --> 00:57:10.000
I went to college
in the early '80s,


1321
00:57:10.042 --> 00:57:11.585
and "Super Freak"
was the kind of song


1322
00:57:11.627 --> 00:57:13.045
you'd hear
at a white frat party.


1323
00:57:13.086 --> 00:57:14.880
Straight from Rick James

1324
00:57:14.922 --> 00:57:16.924
and Dance Party USA's
Halloween Special!


1325
00:57:16.965 --> 00:57:19.051
Awoo!

1326
00:57:19.092 --> 00:57:20.928
And all the rest
of the music they gonna play


1327
00:57:20.969 --> 00:57:22.054
is gonna be rock and roll.

1328
00:57:22.095 --> 00:57:24.014
They're gonna play
one Black song,


1329
00:57:24.056 --> 00:57:25.265
it's gonna be "Super Freak,"

1330
00:57:25.307 --> 00:57:26.767
and they're gonna
freak out over it.


1331
00:57:26.808 --> 00:57:27.827
So it sounds like you've been

1332
00:57:27.851 --> 00:57:29.394
to a few white frat parties.

1333
00:57:29.436 --> 00:57:31.980
You know, I made the rounds,
you know what I'm saying?


1334
00:57:32.022 --> 00:57:35.651
That record spoke
to a different mentality.


1335
00:57:35.692 --> 00:57:37.945
It spoke to the
New Wave generation.


1336
00:57:37.986 --> 00:57:40.113
It spoke to a different tempo.

1337
00:57:40.155 --> 00:57:42.491
You got the Oberheim synth
playing this little riff


1338
00:57:42.532 --> 00:57:44.159
where he's like,

1339
00:57:44.201 --> 00:57:46.495
"This is where I'm gonna
get white folks on board."


1340
00:57:50.123 --> 00:57:53.126
Devo's "Whip It".

1341
00:57:53.168 --> 00:57:55.796
So, it's this little thing
in the mix


1342
00:57:55.837 --> 00:57:59.967
that became the catalyst,
that made it cross over,


1343
00:58:00.008 --> 00:58:02.260
that just kinda caught
white folks' ears, you know.


1344
00:58:02.302 --> 00:58:03.637
The dog whistle for whites.

1345
00:58:03.679 --> 00:58:05.138
Oh, shit.

1346
00:58:05.180 --> 00:58:08.183
She likes the boys in the band.

1347
00:58:08.225 --> 00:58:11.937
She says that
I'm her all-time favorite.


1348
00:58:11.979 --> 00:58:13.814
When I make my move to her room.

1349
00:58:13.855 --> 00:58:15.941
It's the right time.

1350
00:58:15.983 --> 00:58:17.859
She's never hard to please...

1351
00:58:17.901 --> 00:58:20.904
I directed all Rick's videos.

1352
00:58:20.946 --> 00:58:25.450
He was the first visual artist
for Motown.


1353
00:58:25.492 --> 00:58:26.785
New wave magazine.

1354
00:58:26.827 --> 00:58:28.328
That girl is pretty kinky.

1355
00:58:28.370 --> 00:58:30.038
That girl's a super freak...

1356
00:58:30.080 --> 00:58:32.374
It was June 1981.

1357
00:58:32.416 --> 00:58:34.143
It was, like, right after
"Super Freak" came out.


1358
00:58:34.167 --> 00:58:36.837
Us Magazine sent me
to Buffalo, New York,


1359
00:58:36.878 --> 00:58:40.298
to his house, and I did photos
in all the different rooms.


1360
00:58:40.340 --> 00:58:43.176
Rick was really proud
of his things.


1361
00:58:43.218 --> 00:58:45.303
You know, he had these two tusks

1362
00:58:45.345 --> 00:58:48.223
that were going into his pool.

1363
00:58:48.265 --> 00:58:50.684
I mean, it was a little
off the top, you know,


1364
00:58:50.726 --> 00:58:53.478
but I think everything
that he ever wanted,


1365
00:58:53.520 --> 00:58:55.689
he wanted to put in his home
in Buffalo.


1366
00:58:55.731 --> 00:58:57.107
He was living
the rock star life.


1367
00:58:57.149 --> 00:58:59.609
- Do I love sex?
- Yes. Abundantly.


1368
00:58:59.651 --> 00:59:01.987
Do I love women? Yes. Totally.

1369
00:59:02.029 --> 00:59:04.114
Do I love the fact
that I have lots of money


1370
00:59:04.156 --> 00:59:05.782
and I'm rich and famous and...

1371
00:59:05.824 --> 00:59:07.200
Yes. That's real great.

1372
00:59:07.242 --> 00:59:09.411
I started shooting Rick
at concerts.


1373
00:59:09.453 --> 00:59:12.080
- He was the Black Elvis.
- Just larger than life.


1374
00:59:12.122 --> 00:59:14.541
- James Brown on steroids.
- This just says it all.


1375
00:59:14.583 --> 00:59:17.169
His boys around him, and he's
getting ready to go on stage.


1376
00:59:17.210 --> 00:59:18.879
It's a cross between
David Lee Roth,


1377
00:59:18.920 --> 00:59:21.465
Bret Michaels, and Vince Neil,

1378
00:59:21.506 --> 00:59:24.259
before they were even around.

1379
00:59:24.301 --> 00:59:26.970
- He was on top of the world.
- He really was.


1380
00:59:27.012 --> 00:59:28.263
Girl's a super freak.

1381
00:59:28.305 --> 00:59:30.766
He wanted the fame.

1382
00:59:30.807 --> 00:59:33.268
He knew how to get it,

1383
00:59:33.310 --> 00:59:35.771
but he didn't know
how to turn it off.


1384
00:59:35.812 --> 00:59:38.607
That girl's all right.

1385
00:59:38.648 --> 00:59:42.194
With me.

1386
00:59:42.235 --> 00:59:43.904
Yeah.

1387
00:59:43.945 --> 00:59:47.407
He was getting high,
you know, and goofing up.


1388
00:59:47.449 --> 00:59:49.076
He talked about,
"I could have gone


1389
00:59:49.117 --> 00:59:51.203
with another video company,

1390
00:59:51.244 --> 00:59:55.791
or, you know... where they supply
a whole cocaine budget.


1391
00:59:55.832 --> 00:59:57.959
They put into the budget
the cocaine.


1392
00:59:58.001 --> 00:59:59.836
How come you don't do that?"

1393
01:00:01.671 --> 01:00:04.132
There was a kind of
visceral danger about him.


1394
01:00:04.174 --> 01:00:06.218
You see this in the lyrics,
right,


1395
01:00:06.259 --> 01:00:08.136
where he's talking
about perversity and kink


1396
01:00:08.178 --> 01:00:10.722
and the kind of seedier
sides of the erotic.


1397
01:00:10.764 --> 01:00:13.767
You see this in his own
kind of self-presentation,


1398
01:00:13.809 --> 01:00:16.520
the way he dresses and the way
he interacts with the camera.


1399
01:00:16.561 --> 01:00:18.271
He sometimes seemed
really coked up


1400
01:00:18.313 --> 01:00:20.148
in front of the camera.

1401
01:00:20.190 --> 01:00:21.608
This wasn't just a performance.

1402
01:00:21.650 --> 01:00:24.820
This was actually
who he was in some ways.


1403
01:00:25.278 --> 01:00:27.989
If Rick James came along now

1404
01:00:28.031 --> 01:00:29.825
and was doing what he was doing,

1405
01:00:29.866 --> 01:00:33.620
it would not pass the test
in terms of misogyny,


1406
01:00:33.662 --> 01:00:34.830
women as sex objects.

1407
01:00:34.871 --> 01:00:36.206
He would probably stand out

1408
01:00:36.248 --> 01:00:39.000
like a sore thumb
and be ostracized.


1409
01:00:42.671 --> 01:00:44.965
The nominees for
favorite soul album are:


1410
01:00:45.006 --> 01:00:46.967
Gap Band III, The Gap Band...

1411
01:00:49.261 --> 01:00:51.263
Hotter than July,
Stevie Wonder...


1412
01:00:53.932 --> 01:00:56.017
Street Songs, Rick James...

1413
01:00:58.353 --> 01:01:01.648
and The Dude, Quincy Jones.

1414
01:01:03.483 --> 01:01:04.776
And the winner?

1415
01:01:04.818 --> 01:01:07.821
And the winner is...

1416
01:01:07.863 --> 01:01:09.531
Street Songs, Rick James.

1417
01:01:12.492 --> 01:01:14.202
Street Songs
really just facilitated


1418
01:01:14.244 --> 01:01:16.204
this extraordinary explosion

1419
01:01:16.246 --> 01:01:18.707
of what he could do
in all its forms.


1420
01:01:18.748 --> 01:01:21.376
- He's winning awards.
- He's appearing at the Grammys.


1421
01:01:21.418 --> 01:01:24.045
He's expanding his empire.

1422
01:01:24.087 --> 01:01:26.590
Mom, I love you, and I told you

1423
01:01:26.631 --> 01:01:28.842
that there's such a thing
called rock and roll.


1424
01:01:28.884 --> 01:01:30.886
Well, now there's a thing
called funk and roll.


1425
01:01:30.927 --> 01:01:32.220
Thank you, people.

1426
01:01:32.262 --> 01:01:35.390
Rick James was not just
a great songwriter


1427
01:01:35.432 --> 01:01:36.892
and producer for his own music,

1428
01:01:36.933 --> 01:01:38.435
but also for other artists.

1429
01:01:38.476 --> 01:01:41.396
Once Rick showed Motown

1430
01:01:41.438 --> 01:01:44.024
that he could deliver hits,

1431
01:01:44.065 --> 01:01:45.567
they were interested in him

1432
01:01:45.609 --> 01:01:47.903
producing
"Mary Had a Little Lamb."


1433
01:01:47.944 --> 01:01:49.571
They didn't care. Anybody.

1434
01:01:49.613 --> 01:01:50.947
And they had a girl

1435
01:01:50.989 --> 01:01:54.117
who had been a staff writer
there for the longest.


1436
01:01:59.623 --> 01:02:00.749
Teena Marie.

1437
01:02:00.790 --> 01:02:02.250
They didn't know what to do
with her.


1438
01:02:02.292 --> 01:02:04.085
They had made tracks on her.

1439
01:02:04.127 --> 01:02:06.755
They had done all kinds
of styles with her.


1440
01:02:06.796 --> 01:02:08.256
Which song now?

1441
01:02:08.298 --> 01:02:09.758
Anybody ever wrote for me.

1442
01:02:09.799 --> 01:02:12.761
I always wrote songs
for everybody else.


1443
01:02:12.802 --> 01:02:14.596
Nobody ever wrote me one.

1444
01:02:14.638 --> 01:02:17.599
One of Rick James'
greatest contributions


1445
01:02:17.641 --> 01:02:19.517
as a songwriter
and producer and arranger


1446
01:02:19.559 --> 01:02:21.269
was working with Teena Marie.

1447
01:02:21.311 --> 01:02:24.356
He produced her debut album
"Wild and Peaceful."


1448
01:02:24.397 --> 01:02:25.941
I was in California.

1449
01:02:25.982 --> 01:02:27.817
And we're riding down to Motown,

1450
01:02:27.859 --> 01:02:30.320
- and he puts this tape in.
- He said, "Listen to this."


1451
01:02:30.362 --> 01:02:32.155
So, I'm listening to it,

1452
01:02:32.197 --> 01:02:34.491
and I think it was... that it's
a Black girl,


1453
01:02:34.532 --> 01:02:37.077
automatically,
because it had that sound.


1454
01:02:37.118 --> 01:02:40.121
Young and I'm old

1455
01:02:40.163 --> 01:02:43.750
I'm rich and I'm poor.

1456
01:02:43.792 --> 01:02:46.795
It feel like I've been on
this earth.


1457
01:02:46.836 --> 01:02:49.506
Many times before.

1458
01:02:49.547 --> 01:02:51.132
So we get to Motown.

1459
01:02:51.174 --> 01:02:52.842
These two girls
are walking towards us,


1460
01:02:52.884 --> 01:02:54.010
Black and a white one,

1461
01:02:54.052 --> 01:02:55.470
and he said, "Here's Teena now.

1462
01:02:55.512 --> 01:02:57.931
You can meet her,"
and as we get closer,


1463
01:02:57.973 --> 01:02:59.391
I say to the Black girl,

1464
01:02:59.432 --> 01:03:02.269
- "- Hey, I heard your music.
- You're bad."


1465
01:03:02.310 --> 01:03:04.771
- And Rick says, "No, not her.
- Her."


1466
01:03:04.813 --> 01:03:06.314
And I look at
the little white girl,


1467
01:03:06.356 --> 01:03:08.149
and I'm just like, "Her?"

1468
01:03:08.191 --> 01:03:10.568
How did that
happen when you first met Rick?


1469
01:03:10.610 --> 01:03:12.320
He was walking down the hallway.

1470
01:03:12.362 --> 01:03:13.989
- 17th floor?
- Yeah.


1471
01:03:14.030 --> 01:03:15.448
That sounds strange.

1472
01:03:15.490 --> 01:03:16.676
Just walking down the hall
in the record company.


1473
01:03:16.700 --> 01:03:17.909
Walking down the hallway.

1474
01:03:17.951 --> 01:03:19.011
You hadn't
known him before this?


1475
01:03:19.035 --> 01:03:20.829
No, I never knew him
before that.


1476
01:03:22.622 --> 01:03:25.083
I starting working
with Teena by sheer accident.


1477
01:03:25.125 --> 01:03:27.019
I was happened to be walking
around the halls of Motown,


1478
01:03:27.043 --> 01:03:28.461
and I happened to hear this girl

1479
01:03:28.503 --> 01:03:29.939
singing through a room,
and I happened to go in,


1480
01:03:29.963 --> 01:03:31.774
and here's this little
white girl playing piano.


1481
01:03:31.798 --> 01:03:34.426
- And I stopped and I listened.
- And I thought she was great.


1482
01:03:34.467 --> 01:03:35.861
So I had this song
"Sucker for Love,"


1483
01:03:35.885 --> 01:03:36.720
and I put it on Teena.

1484
01:03:36.761 --> 01:03:38.013
Baby, you too.

1485
01:03:38.054 --> 01:03:40.640
Are a mellow fellow.

1486
01:03:40.682 --> 01:03:44.227
And you're as rare
as vintage wine.


1487
01:03:44.269 --> 01:03:45.520
I remember the first time

1488
01:03:45.562 --> 01:03:47.230
they did a session together.

1489
01:03:47.272 --> 01:03:49.524
They were at
Marvin Gaye's studio.


1490
01:03:49.566 --> 01:03:52.319
Everybody and they mama
was in this place,


1491
01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:54.029
all sitting in the control room,

1492
01:03:54.070 --> 01:03:55.238
just watching this.

1493
01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:56.781
Rick was behind the board.

1494
01:03:56.823 --> 01:03:58.533
And he knew exactly
what he wanted.


1495
01:03:58.575 --> 01:04:00.744
And he gave her a huge record.

1496
01:04:00.785 --> 01:04:03.663
He knew she was an R&B vocalist.

1497
01:04:03.705 --> 01:04:05.290
He obviously knew she was white.

1498
01:04:05.332 --> 01:04:06.958
And he didn't really care.

1499
01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:10.378
- He was open-minded.
- He saw she could really blow.


1500
01:04:10.420 --> 01:04:12.464
He allowed her to grow.

1501
01:04:12.505 --> 01:04:15.300
- He tutored her.
- He mentored her.


1502
01:04:15.342 --> 01:04:17.844
And she became a star
in her own right.


1503
01:04:19.763 --> 01:04:24.225
She developed primarily
a Black fan base,


1504
01:04:24.267 --> 01:04:27.187
because she was
authentically Black.


1505
01:04:27.228 --> 01:04:28.563
She just had the soul.

1506
01:04:28.605 --> 01:04:30.523
I used to tell her all the time,

1507
01:04:30.565 --> 01:04:33.902
"Your skin is light,
but you're a Black woman."


1508
01:04:33.943 --> 01:04:35.703
- She was a sister.
- She wasn't faking shit.


1509
01:04:35.737 --> 01:04:37.381
And that's the first thing,
you know, one would think.


1510
01:04:37.405 --> 01:04:39.532
"Man, bitch can't be
all that shit, man.


1511
01:04:39.574 --> 01:04:41.743
You faking this bull."
No, no, she's straight sister.


1512
01:04:41.785 --> 01:04:44.371
Their relationship was initially

1513
01:04:44.412 --> 01:04:46.748
one of big brother
and little sister.


1514
01:04:46.790 --> 01:04:50.460
But it turned into a boy-girl
relationship sort of a thing.


1515
01:04:50.502 --> 01:04:51.896
She said, "Me and Rick
getting married."


1516
01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:53.800
- I said, "When?
- When the fuck you hear this?"


1517
01:04:53.838 --> 01:04:55.131
"Levi, I'm in love,

1518
01:04:55.173 --> 01:04:56.317
- and he's in love.
- We getting married."


1519
01:04:56.341 --> 01:04:59.094
I said,
"Teena, he ain't marrying you."


1520
01:04:59.135 --> 01:05:00.637
And it never happened.

1521
01:05:00.678 --> 01:05:02.806
That was just Rick high
somewhere talking that shit.


1522
01:05:16.653 --> 01:05:18.947
Abuse them.

1523
01:05:22.617 --> 01:05:27.539
Oh, that's what I used to do.

1524
01:05:27.580 --> 01:05:31.960
Use and abuse them.

1525
01:05:35.088 --> 01:05:37.424
Then I laid eyes on you.

1526
01:05:37.465 --> 01:05:39.467
"Fire and Desire"
is one of the most


1527
01:05:39.509 --> 01:05:41.553
perfectly produced songs
ever made.


1528
01:05:41.594 --> 01:05:43.471
Pain for pleasure.

1529
01:05:43.513 --> 01:05:45.098
It walks you through

1530
01:05:45.140 --> 01:05:47.475
a relationship that once was

1531
01:05:47.517 --> 01:05:49.978
but can't be no more.

1532
01:05:50.019 --> 01:05:53.523
- It was burning too hot.
- Too much passion.


1533
01:05:53.565 --> 01:05:56.985
When you don't think Rick
can hang with Teena Marie,


1534
01:05:57.026 --> 01:05:58.570
he does.

1535
01:05:58.611 --> 01:06:00.697
You were cold as ice.

1536
01:06:03.658 --> 01:06:08.204
Don't you know, sugar, sugar.

1537
01:06:08.246 --> 01:06:12.584
It was just some sho'nuff soul.

1538
01:06:12.625 --> 01:06:15.962
It became a big signature
record for he and Teena.


1539
01:06:16.004 --> 01:06:20.758
When I first heard him
doing the duet with Teena,


1540
01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:23.511
I mean,
it was, like, off the chart.


1541
01:06:23.553 --> 01:06:25.638
He brought out something special

1542
01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:27.765
in the people
that were around him.


1543
01:06:27.807 --> 01:06:32.479
He had a certain magic
in his style of production


1544
01:06:32.520 --> 01:06:34.331
that, you know,
all the great producers have...


1545
01:06:34.355 --> 01:06:36.274
The Gamble and Huffs

1546
01:06:36.316 --> 01:06:38.109
and the Princes and the Quincys.

1547
01:06:38.151 --> 01:06:43.031
All night long.

1548
01:06:43.072 --> 01:06:46.701
Long.

1549
01:06:46.743 --> 01:06:49.954
Oh, something's got me
so excited.


1550
01:06:49.996 --> 01:06:52.040
Baby.

1551
01:06:52.081 --> 01:06:56.920
A feeling I've been
holding back so long.


1552
01:06:56.961 --> 01:06:58.671
Ever since I had
established myself,


1553
01:06:58.713 --> 01:07:00.340
I had a concept
for some girl singers.


1554
01:07:00.381 --> 01:07:01.966
'Cause I knew
I can write for girls.


1555
01:07:02.008 --> 01:07:05.094
You know, it's easy for me
to write for them, you know.


1556
01:07:05.136 --> 01:07:07.639
I've been such an asshole
to them that, you know,


1557
01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:10.016
I can kind of reverse and know
how they feel, you know?


1558
01:07:10.058 --> 01:07:12.477
He said, "I'm gonna
start a female group."


1559
01:07:12.519 --> 01:07:14.079
He said, "I want you
to learn these songs,


1560
01:07:14.103 --> 01:07:15.783
'cause these are gonna be
some of the songs


1561
01:07:15.813 --> 01:07:17.232
that I'm gonna use
for the group."


1562
01:07:17.273 --> 01:07:18.417
I really didn't know
what direction


1563
01:07:18.441 --> 01:07:19.734
he wanted to go in
until he said,


1564
01:07:19.776 --> 01:07:21.569
"What kind of music do you like?

1565
01:07:21.611 --> 01:07:24.239
What would you like
this particular project to be?"


1566
01:07:24.280 --> 01:07:27.617
I said, "Something that they're
gonna play 30 years later."


1567
01:07:28.117 --> 01:07:30.411
Boy, you can just best believe

1568
01:07:30.453 --> 01:07:33.414
I'm the only girl in your life.

1569
01:07:36.459 --> 01:07:38.670
I'll be your sugar
in the morning.


1570
01:07:38.711 --> 01:07:41.839
And the sweet stuff
you need at night.


1571
01:07:41.881 --> 01:07:43.675
Rick takes the Mary Jane Girls

1572
01:07:43.716 --> 01:07:46.928
and really pours his
female side into this group.


1573
01:07:46.970 --> 01:07:48.513
We've got this demo
of "In My House"


1574
01:07:48.555 --> 01:07:50.056
with Rick singing
the dummy lyrics.


1575
01:07:50.098 --> 01:07:52.559
But you can just hide your key.

1576
01:07:55.770 --> 01:07:57.564
Could have easily been
a Rick James song.


1577
01:07:57.605 --> 01:07:59.107
But he found a way to make it,

1578
01:07:59.148 --> 01:08:01.359
"No,
I think it's got the girls."


1579
01:08:01.401 --> 01:08:03.987
Maybe there's a falsetto
in his head that he's hearing.


1580
01:08:04.028 --> 01:08:07.574
When you need
a little peace of mind.


1581
01:08:07.615 --> 01:08:11.494
Come on over, boy, anytime

1582
01:08:11.536 --> 01:08:15.540
I'll keep you happy
and so satisfied.


1583
01:08:15.582 --> 01:08:17.542
In my house.

1584
01:08:17.584 --> 01:08:19.586
In my house.

1585
01:08:19.627 --> 01:08:23.089
Rick is taking his vibe
and orchestrating this sound.


1586
01:08:25.883 --> 01:08:27.844
Come home to every night.

1587
01:08:27.885 --> 01:08:30.847
The girl that makes
all your dreams.


1588
01:08:30.888 --> 01:08:33.349
And fantasies come true.

1589
01:08:33.391 --> 01:08:34.976
Rick saw himself

1590
01:08:35.018 --> 01:08:37.645
as a businessman
as well as an artist.


1591
01:08:37.687 --> 01:08:40.148
And he wanted to develop
different acts


1592
01:08:40.189 --> 01:08:42.650
- and own different acts.
- He was entrepreneurial.


1593
01:08:43.693 --> 01:08:45.612
The role of a producer

1594
01:08:45.653 --> 01:08:47.655
is to be able to go
into a recording studio,


1595
01:08:47.697 --> 01:08:50.116
bring musicians together,
record them,


1596
01:08:50.158 --> 01:08:53.578
generate an amazing energy
in that performance,


1597
01:08:53.620 --> 01:08:55.079
and then transfer
that on to record.


1598
01:08:55.121 --> 01:08:57.206
Rick James was amazing
at doing that.


1599
01:08:57.248 --> 01:09:00.376
But he was also really savvy
about creating hits.


1600
01:09:00.418 --> 01:09:02.670
When you're on the top.

1601
01:09:02.712 --> 01:09:04.213
There's no place
you can really go.


1602
01:09:04.255 --> 01:09:07.634
But down, down, down.

1603
01:09:07.675 --> 01:09:09.344
Motown said, "Hey,

1604
01:09:09.385 --> 01:09:10.720
who else you wanna
produce here?"


1605
01:09:10.762 --> 01:09:12.722
So he produced The Temptations,

1606
01:09:12.764 --> 01:09:14.766
"Standing on the Top."
He got them a hit.


1607
01:09:14.807 --> 01:09:17.101
- He worked with Smokey Robinson.
- Then he branched out.


1608
01:09:17.143 --> 01:09:18.519
Eddie Murphy has been in Buffalo

1609
01:09:18.561 --> 01:09:19.771
for almost a week.

1610
01:09:19.812 --> 01:09:21.147
Most of that time has been spent

1611
01:09:21.189 --> 01:09:23.483
inside Rick James'
recording studio.


1612
01:09:23.524 --> 01:09:26.611
The pair plan to produce
Murphy's first singing single.


1613
01:09:26.653 --> 01:09:30.073
My girl wants to party
all the time.


1614
01:09:30.114 --> 01:09:35.078
Party all the time.

1615
01:09:39.165 --> 01:09:40.625
Yeah.

1616
01:09:42.502 --> 01:09:44.837
Daddy was showing him
the ropes like a big brother.


1617
01:09:44.879 --> 01:09:47.674
And Eddie was like a kid
at that time


1618
01:09:47.715 --> 01:09:49.967
and really looked up to my dad.

1619
01:09:50.009 --> 01:09:52.720
They had a lot of love
and respect for each other.


1620
01:09:52.762 --> 01:09:56.391
Mick Jagger... I had a great
big influence on Mick.


1621
01:09:56.432 --> 01:10:00.395
When I first met Mick,
his lip was small.


1622
01:10:00.436 --> 01:10:03.398
And after meeting me,
he came out with this new look.


1623
01:10:06.567 --> 01:10:07.819
Being in a rock and roll band

1624
01:10:07.860 --> 01:10:09.654
is not a lot of free time.

1625
01:10:09.696 --> 01:10:11.656
Rock and roll is hard,
going at it hard.


1626
01:10:11.698 --> 01:10:13.825
- Especially funk.
- You gotta hit it hard.


1627
01:10:13.866 --> 01:10:16.244
- Hit it like you're fighting it.
- That's what he did.


1628
01:10:22.125 --> 01:10:25.211
I think my dad
being absent from my life


1629
01:10:25.253 --> 01:10:29.757
- was just... there was a void.
- There was an emptiness.


1630
01:10:29.799 --> 01:10:32.218
To my knowledge,
I met him for the first time


1631
01:10:32.260 --> 01:10:35.096
when I was 13 years old.

1632
01:10:35.138 --> 01:10:36.573
But there were
years when he gave you


1633
01:10:36.597 --> 01:10:38.599
absolutely no money, right?

1634
01:10:38.641 --> 01:10:41.394
Correct. He didn't even know
where I was.


1635
01:10:41.436 --> 01:10:44.397
When you have a father
that has millions of dollars,


1636
01:10:44.439 --> 01:10:47.150
like, you think
that you should be riding


1637
01:10:47.191 --> 01:10:51.362
in the Benzes and the Rollses,
and you have all the new bags


1638
01:10:51.404 --> 01:10:54.198
and the Girbaud jeans
that everybody is wearing,


1639
01:10:54.240 --> 01:10:55.950
and the Jordache.

1640
01:10:55.992 --> 01:10:58.578
You know,
and that wasn't the case.


1641
01:10:58.619 --> 01:11:00.455
My brother, Little Rickie,

1642
01:11:00.496 --> 01:11:01.873
he's two years younger than me.

1643
01:11:01.914 --> 01:11:03.958
And so he would go around, like,

1644
01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.794
bragging about who his dad was.

1645
01:11:06.836 --> 01:11:09.881
And, you know, me being
the older sister, I'm like,


1646
01:11:09.922 --> 01:11:12.967
- "- Stop telling people that.
- Don't tell nobody else that."


1647
01:11:13.009 --> 01:11:14.802
So...

1648
01:11:14.844 --> 01:11:17.472
one little boy he told,
I guess his dad happened


1649
01:11:17.513 --> 01:11:19.599
to work for my father,
as security,


1650
01:11:19.640 --> 01:11:22.435
and his dad wind up
telling my father,


1651
01:11:22.477 --> 01:11:24.145
and my dad was probably like,

1652
01:11:24.187 --> 01:11:27.148
- "- Well, where are they at?
- Because it probably is."


1653
01:11:27.190 --> 01:11:30.026
A private investigator
knocked on our door,


1654
01:11:30.067 --> 01:11:33.821
and within days we were flown
to Buffalo, New York


1655
01:11:33.863 --> 01:11:35.364
to meet our dad
for the first time.


1656
01:11:35.406 --> 01:11:37.158
When we landed,

1657
01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:40.119
he told us that he went up
to some other kids,


1658
01:11:40.161 --> 01:11:42.121
and it wasn't us,
so it was, like,


1659
01:11:42.163 --> 01:11:44.874
this whole big ordeal about,
you know,


1660
01:11:44.916 --> 01:11:47.293
him not really knowing
who his children were.


1661
01:11:47.335 --> 01:11:50.004
I just welcomed him
with open arms,


1662
01:11:50.046 --> 01:11:52.799
and it was... it was
instant love.


1663
01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:55.843
He's living this
rock-and-roll lifestyle.


1664
01:11:55.885 --> 01:11:58.513
I could see him trying
to tone it down a tiny bit.


1665
01:11:58.554 --> 01:12:00.681
He still has to be RJ.

1666
01:12:00.723 --> 01:12:02.308
And Rick would treat
his little boy


1667
01:12:02.350 --> 01:12:04.769
- like he was a grown man.
- And I got mad at Rick.


1668
01:12:04.811 --> 01:12:07.271
I said, "Rick, man,
you just met him again.


1669
01:12:07.313 --> 01:12:10.107
Why are you hollering at him?"
"Because he's doing dumb shit."


1670
01:12:10.149 --> 01:12:12.693
"Yeah. That's his job,
to do dumb shit.


1671
01:12:12.735 --> 01:12:14.463
Your job is to make sure
he doesn't do it anymore.


1672
01:12:14.487 --> 01:12:16.656
You took them out
of the projects, man,


1673
01:12:16.697 --> 01:12:18.199
to come out
to this huge mansion.


1674
01:12:18.241 --> 01:12:20.201
They're, like, in awe,
and you gonna holler at him


1675
01:12:20.243 --> 01:12:22.829
because he did some stupid shit
a kid would do?


1676
01:12:22.870 --> 01:12:24.330
Come on, man. Let it go."

1677
01:12:24.372 --> 01:12:28.376
At times, when he would
try to be a father,


1678
01:12:28.417 --> 01:12:31.712
it would be more so, like,
"I'm gonna go out.


1679
01:12:31.754 --> 01:12:33.548
- I'm gonna hang out.
- I'm gonna go party.


1680
01:12:33.589 --> 01:12:36.050
But when I get back, you better
still... stay in your room.


1681
01:12:36.092 --> 01:12:38.052
Like, don't come out
the rest of the night."


1682
01:12:38.094 --> 01:12:41.013
Like, I'm, like, "Oh my God."
Like, I would almost be scared


1683
01:12:41.055 --> 01:12:43.599
to see what was taking place
outside the doors.


1684
01:12:43.641 --> 01:12:45.893
Walking over naked girls

1685
01:12:45.935 --> 01:12:48.563
at 7:00 a.m. in the morning
was normal to me.


1686
01:12:48.604 --> 01:12:50.231
I'm like, "Oh, excuse me."

1687
01:12:54.277 --> 01:12:56.445
Rick James fashioned himself

1688
01:12:56.487 --> 01:12:58.781
into a kind of unique creation.

1689
01:12:58.823 --> 01:13:00.575
So there was no one else
like Rick James


1690
01:13:00.616 --> 01:13:02.994
at all
that existed in the scene.


1691
01:13:03.035 --> 01:13:05.037
However, there was someone
who would eventually


1692
01:13:05.079 --> 01:13:06.348
become quite close
to Rick James,


1693
01:13:06.372 --> 01:13:08.052
in terms of his image,
and that was Prince.


1694
01:13:13.713 --> 01:13:15.274
My manager brought
some tapes over and said,


1695
01:13:15.298 --> 01:13:16.733
"Well, there's this kid
who's got this record.


1696
01:13:16.757 --> 01:13:18.777
'I Want to Be Your Lover.'"
And I loved that record.


1697
01:13:18.801 --> 01:13:19.945
And I saw some videos of him.

1698
01:13:19.969 --> 01:13:21.429
And, you know,
he was cool, you know.


1699
01:13:21.470 --> 01:13:23.389
I mean,
I felt he resembled us a lot.


1700
01:13:23.431 --> 01:13:25.182
I ain't got no money.

1701
01:13:27.310 --> 01:13:30.897
I ain't like those
other guys you hang around.


1702
01:13:30.938 --> 01:13:33.608
In the late 1970s,
the music industry


1703
01:13:33.649 --> 01:13:36.068
had its hopes pinned on Prince.

1704
01:13:36.110 --> 01:13:38.613
Prince, who was trying
to find his legs


1705
01:13:38.654 --> 01:13:40.281
as a musician and as an artist,

1706
01:13:40.323 --> 01:13:42.408
ended up on tour
with Rick James.


1707
01:13:42.450 --> 01:13:44.118
He actually opened
for Rick James.


1708
01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:45.328
Oh, my God.

1709
01:13:45.369 --> 01:13:49.457
Rick had a love-hate
relationship with Prince.


1710
01:13:49.498 --> 01:13:53.294
He loved him because he loved
what Prince was about.


1711
01:13:53.336 --> 01:13:55.171
- He loved the swagger.
- He loved the music.


1712
01:13:55.212 --> 01:13:57.840
He hated him
because Prince gave him heat.


1713
01:13:57.882 --> 01:14:00.301
Rick definitely had
an attitude with Prince.


1714
01:14:00.343 --> 01:14:02.762
They just was competing
with one another.


1715
01:14:02.803 --> 01:14:05.723
Rick got mad when Prince
would watch us on stage


1716
01:14:05.765 --> 01:14:06.933
and do the same goddamn shit.

1717
01:14:06.974 --> 01:14:09.560
Rick would go, "Ooh, ooh."

1718
01:14:09.602 --> 01:14:11.979
And his audience would go crazy
every time he would do that.


1719
01:14:12.021 --> 01:14:15.608
Prince would start doing
the "Ooh, ooh"...


1720
01:14:17.610 --> 01:14:19.487
before Rick would come out.

1721
01:14:19.528 --> 01:14:22.657
And Rick was like,
"Man, you can't do that.


1722
01:14:22.698 --> 01:14:24.492
- '- Ooh, ooh' stuff.
- That's what I do."


1723
01:14:24.533 --> 01:14:26.494
And Prince was like, "Dude.

1724
01:14:26.535 --> 01:14:30.665
You don't have a monopoly on
'Ooh, ooh.'


1725
01:14:30.706 --> 01:14:32.667
I can do what the fuck
I want to do."


1726
01:14:32.708 --> 01:14:33.834
I got really pissed off.

1727
01:14:33.876 --> 01:14:35.503
And I went
and told his managers.


1728
01:14:35.544 --> 01:14:37.439
I said, "Look, how can I go up
and do what I gotta do


1729
01:14:37.463 --> 01:14:39.924
if this dude's
gonna be taking my shit?"


1730
01:14:39.966 --> 01:14:41.193
It all straightened itself out.

1731
01:14:41.217 --> 01:14:42.468
But I mean, you know, Prince

1732
01:14:42.510 --> 01:14:44.011
was giving me hell on the road.

1733
01:14:44.053 --> 01:14:47.181
I remember being on shows
with Rick and Prince,


1734
01:14:47.223 --> 01:14:50.351
and, you know, they would
pull plugs on each other,


1735
01:14:50.393 --> 01:14:53.229
you know,
and get ready to go to blows.


1736
01:14:53.270 --> 01:14:54.981
I used to always say to Rick,
you know,


1737
01:14:55.022 --> 01:14:58.109
"We all are just doing
our own kind of thing.


1738
01:14:58.150 --> 01:15:00.861
Like, you know,
Prince is Prince, you're you.


1739
01:15:00.903 --> 01:15:03.155
We all have our own identity

1740
01:15:03.197 --> 01:15:05.241
when it comes
to the world of funk."


1741
01:15:05.282 --> 01:15:07.201
Prince was, like, what, 21, 22?

1742
01:15:07.243 --> 01:15:09.161
We can't do what a 21-
or 22-year-old dude


1743
01:15:09.203 --> 01:15:10.788
- can do anymore.
- We tried.


1744
01:15:10.830 --> 01:15:12.248
But we had a lot of, you know,

1745
01:15:12.289 --> 01:15:14.917
shots and B12 shots
and shit we'd have to take.


1746
01:15:14.959 --> 01:15:18.170
I think, whenever the master
sees an acolyte


1747
01:15:18.212 --> 01:15:20.214
who might be younger and hotter,

1748
01:15:20.256 --> 01:15:22.800
the master gets
a little nervous.


1749
01:15:22.842 --> 01:15:24.677
MTV. Music Television.

1750
01:15:24.719 --> 01:15:28.139
- Video music, 24 hours a day.
- And it's stereo.


1751
01:15:28.180 --> 01:15:29.890
Other than Prince,

1752
01:15:29.932 --> 01:15:32.226
Rick's biggest battle
was with MTV.


1753
01:15:32.268 --> 01:15:34.228
The American
recording industry essentially


1754
01:15:34.270 --> 01:15:37.064
divides rock and roll music
into two basic categories:


1755
01:15:37.106 --> 01:15:39.859
White rock
and Black rhythm and blues.


1756
01:15:39.900 --> 01:15:41.211
We are looking
for a certain sound


1757
01:15:41.235 --> 01:15:42.737
and a certain point of view.

1758
01:15:42.778 --> 01:15:44.238
We are not all things
to all people.


1759
01:15:44.280 --> 01:15:46.699
MTV, as an institution,
thought of itself


1760
01:15:46.741 --> 01:15:49.869
as a platform

1761
01:15:49.910 --> 01:15:52.913
that would play music videos
that would primarily appeal


1762
01:15:52.955 --> 01:15:55.124
to its desired demographic,

1763
01:15:55.166 --> 01:15:56.852
which is young white men
who are into rock music.


1764
01:15:56.876 --> 01:15:58.502
And that meant that
Black artists


1765
01:15:58.544 --> 01:16:02.173
had very little opportunity
to present themselves on MTV.


1766
01:16:02.214 --> 01:16:05.468
In fact, they just didn't play
most Black music videos.


1767
01:16:05.509 --> 01:16:07.511
Consumers of both
Black and pop music


1768
01:16:07.553 --> 01:16:09.513
bought 3 million copies
of Rick James' album.


1769
01:16:09.555 --> 01:16:12.683
"Super Freak,"
but MTV would not air it.


1770
01:16:12.725 --> 01:16:13.893
MTV doesn't play Rick James.

1771
01:16:13.934 --> 01:16:14.995
They don't play Michael Jackson.

1772
01:16:15.019 --> 01:16:16.121
They don't play the Commodores.

1773
01:16:16.145 --> 01:16:17.414
They don't play
Earth, Wind & Fire.


1774
01:16:17.438 --> 01:16:19.207
- They don't play Stevie Wonder.
- Why is that?


1775
01:16:19.231 --> 01:16:21.025
When Rick tried to get on,

1776
01:16:21.067 --> 01:16:22.777
he didn't have that muscle

1777
01:16:22.818 --> 01:16:27.073
that Warner Brothers
or Columbia Records provided.


1778
01:16:27.114 --> 01:16:29.450
And I just remember him
getting on the phone


1779
01:16:29.492 --> 01:16:32.870
and just screaming at me
and saying,


1780
01:16:32.912 --> 01:16:37.374
"Why did you not stand
your ground


1781
01:16:37.416 --> 01:16:40.961
and make them put.

1782
01:16:41.003 --> 01:16:43.255
"Super Freak" on there?

1783
01:16:43.297 --> 01:16:47.301
So what Rick chose to do
was to take his war public.


1784
01:16:47.343 --> 01:16:49.321
We're being sat in the back
of the bus, television-style.


1785
01:16:49.345 --> 01:16:50.554
This isn't The Wizard of Oz.

1786
01:16:50.596 --> 01:16:51.823
I mean,
there are Black people here.


1787
01:16:51.847 --> 01:16:53.390
And we make music.

1788
01:16:53.432 --> 01:16:55.077
And we spent thousands...
A hundred thousand


1789
01:16:55.101 --> 01:16:57.228
- dollars on videos.
- I mean, don't we exist?


1790
01:16:57.269 --> 01:16:59.355
In the case of Rick James,

1791
01:16:59.396 --> 01:17:02.817
the determination was made
that it was an R&B song


1792
01:17:02.858 --> 01:17:05.027
and was not
a rock and roll song.


1793
01:17:05.069 --> 01:17:06.320
I was very vocal,

1794
01:17:06.362 --> 01:17:07.947
because I'm very vocal
about injustice.


1795
01:17:07.988 --> 01:17:09.925
I've never been one to bite
my tongue, and I never will.


1796
01:17:09.949 --> 01:17:10.967
If I see something funky
that's going on,


1797
01:17:10.991 --> 01:17:12.118
I'm gonna speak on it.

1798
01:17:12.159 --> 01:17:13.494
In the past few months,

1799
01:17:13.536 --> 01:17:14.662
MTV has increased

1800
01:17:14.703 --> 01:17:16.664
the number of Black videos
it programs


1801
01:17:16.705 --> 01:17:19.792
to include
Michael Jackson and Prince.


1802
01:17:19.834 --> 01:17:24.171
Michael, because of this
whole thing that Rick did,


1803
01:17:24.213 --> 01:17:29.135
was able to be the person
that MTV say,


1804
01:17:29.176 --> 01:17:31.095
"No, we do play Black music

1805
01:17:31.137 --> 01:17:33.472
because we start
playing Michael Jackson."


1806
01:17:33.514 --> 01:17:36.183
Being Black, you see this all
the time with white people.


1807
01:17:36.225 --> 01:17:40.437
They'll pick someone
that is still kind of edgy,


1808
01:17:40.479 --> 01:17:41.689
but not too edgy.

1809
01:17:41.730 --> 01:17:43.357
You look at Michael

1810
01:17:43.399 --> 01:17:45.985
standing next to Rick,
at that point in time,


1811
01:17:46.026 --> 01:17:48.195
they're gonna gravitate
to Michael.


1812
01:17:48.237 --> 01:17:49.530
MTV should give the opportunity,

1813
01:17:49.572 --> 01:17:51.282
whether they're playing
Rick James or not,


1814
01:17:51.323 --> 01:17:52.658
I think they should play...

1815
01:17:52.700 --> 01:17:54.010
There's a lot of great
Black videos out there,


1816
01:17:54.034 --> 01:17:55.536
and I think they should be seen.

1817
01:17:55.578 --> 01:17:57.329
In one way, I'm sad I spoke out.

1818
01:17:57.371 --> 01:17:58.765
In another way,
I'm happy that I spoke out.


1819
01:17:58.789 --> 01:18:00.082
Because it didn't help me.

1820
01:18:00.124 --> 01:18:01.726
I mean, it didn't get me
any videos played.


1821
01:18:01.750 --> 01:18:04.295
I had met with one
of the MTV executives,


1822
01:18:04.336 --> 01:18:06.380
and we got drunk together
in New York at a club.


1823
01:18:06.422 --> 01:18:07.566
And he had told me... he said,
"Rick, you know,


1824
01:18:07.590 --> 01:18:09.258
they just got a hard-on
for you, man."


1825
01:18:09.300 --> 01:18:11.194
And that's one of the things
that really hurt me.


1826
01:18:11.218 --> 01:18:13.053
He's not trusting Motown.

1827
01:18:13.095 --> 01:18:15.639
And I probably perpetuated
that as well.


1828
01:18:15.681 --> 01:18:18.976
"You're not helping us out
at Motown."


1829
01:18:19.018 --> 01:18:21.061
No one liked him after that,
you know?


1830
01:18:21.103 --> 01:18:23.314
It was too much.

1831
01:18:23.355 --> 01:18:26.066
Rick pretty much knew
that he was responsible


1832
01:18:26.108 --> 01:18:28.194
for his demise at Motown.

1833
01:18:28.235 --> 01:18:31.113
After the "Throwin' Down"
record,


1834
01:18:31.155 --> 01:18:32.740
he had come off of tour.

1835
01:18:32.781 --> 01:18:36.160
On the Super Freak tour,
we made 40 million bucks.


1836
01:18:36.202 --> 01:18:39.872
On the Throwin' Down tour,
he only made 13 million bucks


1837
01:18:39.914 --> 01:18:42.541
because the record didn't do
as well as Street Songs.


1838
01:18:42.583 --> 01:18:45.711
When he was delivering
his record to Motown,


1839
01:18:45.753 --> 01:18:47.254
I was with him,

1840
01:18:47.296 --> 01:18:51.383
and we went
into Jay Lasker's office.


1841
01:18:51.425 --> 01:18:54.386
Now, Jay Lasker was
the president of Motown.


1842
01:18:54.428 --> 01:18:57.097
The way that it was is that
he would turn in a tape


1843
01:18:57.139 --> 01:18:58.950
and he would get a check
for a million dollars.


1844
01:18:58.974 --> 01:19:01.060
He says, "Here's your tapes."

1845
01:19:01.101 --> 01:19:03.395
And then Jay
was like... with a cigar...


1846
01:19:03.437 --> 01:19:05.231
"Okay, yeah.

1847
01:19:05.272 --> 01:19:07.441
Well, give him
his million dollars," right?


1848
01:19:07.483 --> 01:19:10.653
So as he gets
his million dollars,


1849
01:19:10.694 --> 01:19:13.572
he grabs the million dollars
and said, "You know what,


1850
01:19:13.614 --> 01:19:14.966
I don't give a fuck
about a million dollars."


1851
01:19:14.990 --> 01:19:17.159
He said,
"Sell my goddamn record!"


1852
01:19:17.201 --> 01:19:18.619
And Jay was like, "Dude."

1853
01:19:18.661 --> 01:19:20.871
He said, "No! You sell
my motherfucking record!


1854
01:19:20.913 --> 01:19:22.289
Because the fact
of the matter is.


1855
01:19:22.331 --> 01:19:25.125
I made $40 million on tour
with 'Street Songs, '


1856
01:19:25.167 --> 01:19:26.585
and I only made $13 million.

1857
01:19:26.627 --> 01:19:28.230
I don't give a fuck
about this million dollars!


1858
01:19:28.254 --> 01:19:29.546
Sell my motherfucking record

1859
01:19:29.588 --> 01:19:31.024
so I can make
some motherfucking money!"


1860
01:19:31.048 --> 01:19:33.592
And then Rick pulls out cocaine,

1861
01:19:33.634 --> 01:19:35.970
puts it on the desk,
chops it up,


1862
01:19:36.011 --> 01:19:38.514
snorts it
in front of Jay Lasker.


1863
01:19:38.555 --> 01:19:39.908
And Jay Lasker's
sitting back there.


1864
01:19:39.932 --> 01:19:41.225
I'm sitting next to Rick.

1865
01:19:41.267 --> 01:19:43.143
And I'm like, "Oh, shit," right?

1866
01:19:43.185 --> 01:19:45.479
And then Rick snorts it,

1867
01:19:45.521 --> 01:19:47.606
jumps on Jay Lasker's desk,

1868
01:19:47.648 --> 01:19:49.334
puts his dick in front
of Jay Lasker's face,


1869
01:19:49.358 --> 01:19:51.902
and says,
"Sell my goddamn record!"


1870
01:19:51.944 --> 01:19:53.487
He takes the check

1871
01:19:53.529 --> 01:19:55.489
and he walks out
of Jay Lasker's office.


1872
01:19:55.531 --> 01:19:58.659
And then Jay Lasker says to me,

1873
01:19:58.701 --> 01:19:59.994
"Lionel Richie."

1874
01:20:00.035 --> 01:20:01.035
Hello.

1875
01:20:03.539 --> 01:20:06.917
Is it me you're looking for?

1876
01:20:06.959 --> 01:20:08.669
And that was it.

1877
01:20:08.711 --> 01:20:10.337
He was done with Rick.

1878
01:20:10.379 --> 01:20:13.465
And his focus went
on Lionel Richie.


1879
01:20:13.507 --> 01:20:15.426
And that's the reason
that Lionel Richie


1880
01:20:15.467 --> 01:20:20.180
got all of this incredible,
amazing push.


1881
01:20:20.222 --> 01:20:22.516
I think he suffered

1882
01:20:22.558 --> 01:20:25.519
from all the usual ailments

1883
01:20:25.561 --> 01:20:28.731
that assault
show business people.


1884
01:20:28.772 --> 01:20:31.525
Too much adulation
is not healthy.


1885
01:20:31.567 --> 01:20:36.322
- Gets you high.
- He suffered from entitlement.


1886
01:20:36.363 --> 01:20:37.823
"I've worked so hard.

1887
01:20:37.865 --> 01:20:39.700
I might as well get
whatever I want...


1888
01:20:39.742 --> 01:20:41.744
Whatever woman,
whatever drug."


1889
01:20:41.785 --> 01:20:44.705
Show business, if you're not
emotionally well-grounded,


1890
01:20:44.747 --> 01:20:46.415
will chew you up
and spit you out.


1891
01:20:46.457 --> 01:20:48.834
You could almost think

1892
01:20:48.876 --> 01:20:52.379
that Rick had
multiple personalities


1893
01:20:52.421 --> 01:20:55.299
because you could talk
to any number of people


1894
01:20:55.341 --> 01:20:56.735
they would say,
"Oh, he's very generous."


1895
01:20:56.759 --> 01:21:00.512
But now, if there was
another situation,


1896
01:21:00.554 --> 01:21:03.891
"Rick, how about putting
our names... not my name,


1897
01:21:03.932 --> 01:21:06.143
our names... on this record?"

1898
01:21:06.185 --> 01:21:08.729
He wouldn't say no.

1899
01:21:08.771 --> 01:21:10.397
But it never happened.

1900
01:21:10.439 --> 01:21:11.690
We didn't get shit from Rick.

1901
01:21:11.732 --> 01:21:13.859
The idea was,
"I'm gonna get you guys."


1902
01:21:13.901 --> 01:21:16.236
You know, very charismatically
saying,


1903
01:21:16.278 --> 01:21:18.030
"I'm gonna pay you guys off,
man.


1904
01:21:18.072 --> 01:21:19.883
- You've been beautiful.
- You've been wonderful,"


1905
01:21:19.907 --> 01:21:22.326
- and all this shit.
- Man, where's the money?


1906
01:21:22.368 --> 01:21:24.453
- Fuck the fame.
- I want the fortune, bro.


1907
01:21:24.495 --> 01:21:26.580
The guys in other bands
that I knew


1908
01:21:26.622 --> 01:21:28.707
were buying houses
in Miami and shit,


1909
01:21:28.749 --> 01:21:30.084
and in Panama.

1910
01:21:30.125 --> 01:21:31.627
These motherfuckers with us,
man...


1911
01:21:31.668 --> 01:21:33.379
Just enough rent fucking money.

1912
01:21:36.256 --> 01:21:37.466
I think it had become clear

1913
01:21:37.508 --> 01:21:39.134
that Rick James' behavior

1914
01:21:39.176 --> 01:21:40.719
was erratic, was excessive.

1915
01:21:40.761 --> 01:21:43.889
Drugs were a source
of the reason why


1916
01:21:43.931 --> 01:21:46.141
his career stalled in the 1980s.

1917
01:21:46.183 --> 01:21:47.476
Drugs incapacitated him.

1918
01:21:47.518 --> 01:21:48.936
I did a whole bunch of shit,

1919
01:21:48.977 --> 01:21:51.063
but I had one thing
that Rick didn't have.


1920
01:21:51.105 --> 01:21:52.773
I knew it came to a time,

1921
01:21:52.815 --> 01:21:54.441
"I can't be doing
this shit no more."


1922
01:21:54.483 --> 01:21:56.110
The worst thing God ever did

1923
01:21:56.151 --> 01:21:58.195
was put cocaine in a form
where you could smoke it.


1924
01:21:58.237 --> 01:21:59.446
You don't quit.

1925
01:21:59.488 --> 01:22:00.632
When they was smoking that shit,

1926
01:22:00.656 --> 01:22:02.282
they did it all day
and all night.


1927
01:22:02.324 --> 01:22:04.368
I started to see him as a person

1928
01:22:04.410 --> 01:22:06.870
who had an addiction.

1929
01:22:06.912 --> 01:22:10.290
When someone has an addiction,
they're not rationale.


1930
01:22:10.332 --> 01:22:12.543
They're not thinking rationally.

1931
01:22:12.584 --> 01:22:14.211
Rick was the only one

1932
01:22:14.253 --> 01:22:16.922
that really allowed that drug

1933
01:22:16.964 --> 01:22:19.716
to take over and change
who you really are.


1934
01:22:19.758 --> 01:22:22.594
And over time, as, primarily,

1935
01:22:22.636 --> 01:22:25.973
band members saw that,
they began to peel off.


1936
01:22:26.014 --> 01:22:28.559
It kind of fell apart
gradually, you know.


1937
01:22:28.600 --> 01:22:30.811
Things started
to kind of unravel.


1938
01:22:30.853 --> 01:22:32.479
I was the first person to leave.

1939
01:22:32.521 --> 01:22:34.773
It just wasn't feeling
right for me.


1940
01:22:34.815 --> 01:22:36.442
I left before all that...
The shit


1941
01:22:36.483 --> 01:22:37.794
started getting
really out of pocket,


1942
01:22:37.818 --> 01:22:40.946
'cause it got to a point
where Rick was Rick now.


1943
01:22:40.988 --> 01:22:43.282
There's no more
James Johnson, Jr.


1944
01:22:43.323 --> 01:22:45.284
That dude gone.

1945
01:22:45.325 --> 01:22:47.870
Got to the point to where.

1946
01:22:47.911 --> 01:22:51.165
Rick's primary circle

1947
01:22:51.206 --> 01:22:53.625
wasn't the band anymore.

1948
01:22:53.667 --> 01:22:56.503
- Everybody want to be around.
- They know you get high.


1949
01:22:56.545 --> 01:22:58.380
They want to bring it to you.

1950
01:22:58.422 --> 01:22:59.965
They don't want
the best for you.


1951
01:23:00.007 --> 01:23:01.925
And a lot of times,
Rick used to tell me


1952
01:23:01.967 --> 01:23:03.635
he felt he was a tool.

1953
01:23:03.677 --> 01:23:06.638
Everyone wanted to come to him
to get this and get that.


1954
01:23:06.680 --> 01:23:09.349
I wish that there was somebody

1955
01:23:09.391 --> 01:23:11.185
who would go up on stage
and be Rick James.


1956
01:23:11.226 --> 01:23:12.478
I wish that there was somebody

1957
01:23:12.519 --> 01:23:13.788
who could have lived
my lifestyle,


1958
01:23:13.812 --> 01:23:15.165
when I was living
all through my pain.


1959
01:23:15.189 --> 01:23:17.858
I would have loved to have that.

1960
01:23:17.900 --> 01:23:19.776
It would have taken
a lot of pressure off me.


1961
01:23:19.818 --> 01:23:22.321
- One day, I had him crying.
- I was mad at him, man.


1962
01:23:22.362 --> 01:23:24.948
I was so mad...
"That white bitch got you"...


1963
01:23:24.990 --> 01:23:26.468
That's what we called cocaine...
"That white bitch


1964
01:23:26.492 --> 01:23:28.702
got you fucked up, man."

1965
01:23:28.744 --> 01:23:30.555
And he would say, "Like, man,
I just can't stop."


1966
01:23:30.579 --> 01:23:32.498
I said, "Goddamn it,
you're weak.


1967
01:23:32.539 --> 01:23:34.708
You're a weak motherfucker, man.

1968
01:23:34.750 --> 01:23:37.211
- You can't keep doing this shit.
- It's gonna kill you."


1969
01:23:37.252 --> 01:23:39.546
I was in a lawsuit
with Motown Records


1970
01:23:39.588 --> 01:23:40.839
for about five or six years

1971
01:23:40.881 --> 01:23:42.841
where I couldn't make an album.

1972
01:23:42.883 --> 01:23:44.885
And that whole period of time,

1973
01:23:44.927 --> 01:23:47.346
my drug addiction
really just escalated.


1974
01:23:47.387 --> 01:23:50.224
I was spending six, seven...
Seven, eight thousand dollars


1975
01:23:50.265 --> 01:23:54.061
- a week on drugs... cocaine.
- This went on for years.


1976
01:23:54.102 --> 01:23:55.742
'Cause I pretty much
just stopped touring.


1977
01:23:55.771 --> 01:23:58.774
And I was basically
just isolating myself.


1978
01:23:58.815 --> 01:24:03.111
I never experienced him
smoking cocaine.


1979
01:24:03.153 --> 01:24:05.739
Like, I never saw him high.

1980
01:24:05.781 --> 01:24:09.201
So I think he wanted me
to believe


1981
01:24:09.243 --> 01:24:10.661
that that wasn't taking place.

1982
01:24:10.702 --> 01:24:12.996
But, I mean, of course, I knew.

1983
01:24:13.038 --> 01:24:16.500
The moment that really
marks a change in the way


1984
01:24:16.542 --> 01:24:19.378
that we think
about Rick James is 1990.


1985
01:24:19.419 --> 01:24:21.505
MC Hammer's
"U Can't Touch This".


1986
01:24:21.547 --> 01:24:22.756
Can't touch this

1987
01:24:22.798 --> 01:24:24.091
I've only met MC Hammer

1988
01:24:24.132 --> 01:24:25.509
one time in my life,

1989
01:24:25.551 --> 01:24:27.070
- and he was a nice guy.
- I mean, he was okay.


1990
01:24:27.094 --> 01:24:29.012
But at the time,
a lot of rap was going on


1991
01:24:29.054 --> 01:24:31.390
that was really kind of
off-beat,


1992
01:24:31.431 --> 01:24:32.891
very derogative towards women.

1993
01:24:32.933 --> 01:24:34.434
Listen up, baby,
you look real pretty.


1994
01:24:34.476 --> 01:24:35.954
Let me pull off your shirt
and suck yo titties.


1995
01:24:35.978 --> 01:24:37.563
And I really got pissed off,

1996
01:24:37.604 --> 01:24:39.123
because I certainly
didn't need the money.


1997
01:24:39.147 --> 01:24:40.875
And I told my accountants
and lawyers, "No more rappers


1998
01:24:40.899 --> 01:24:42.627
are allowed to use
any of my stuff. Nothing."


1999
01:24:42.651 --> 01:24:44.152
Rick was not
a big fan of hip hop,


2000
01:24:44.194 --> 01:24:47.281
and a lot of older
Black artists at the time


2001
01:24:47.322 --> 01:24:50.284
were not fans of hip hop
when it emerged.


2002
01:24:50.325 --> 01:24:51.785
Matter of fact,
they were hating.


2003
01:24:51.827 --> 01:24:53.513
But I think, if you look
at the history of music,


2004
01:24:53.537 --> 01:24:56.832
whenever there's a new form,
old heads often don't like it.


2005
01:24:56.873 --> 01:24:59.459
Louis Armstrong didn't like
what Charlie Parker


2006
01:24:59.501 --> 01:25:01.587
and Dizzy Gillespie was doing.

2007
01:25:04.214 --> 01:25:05.966
I was driving in LA,
and I heard the DJ


2008
01:25:06.008 --> 01:25:08.010
say something about Rick James.

2009
01:25:08.051 --> 01:25:09.845
And then he said,
this is number five


2010
01:25:09.886 --> 01:25:11.322
in the country pop record
or something.


2011
01:25:11.346 --> 01:25:13.181
And he played it on...
Nah, nah, nah, nah.


2012
01:25:13.223 --> 01:25:14.725
Nah-nah, nah-nah.

2013
01:25:14.766 --> 01:25:16.286
And I said, "Oh, great."
You know, "I'm back."


2014
01:25:16.310 --> 01:25:17.662
And then the record stopped
and the guy says,


2015
01:25:17.686 --> 01:25:19.313
"Can't Touch This."
What?


2016
01:25:19.354 --> 01:25:20.731
And then
he really pissed me off.


2017
01:25:20.772 --> 01:25:23.317
- He says this line...
- My-my-my-my.


2018
01:25:23.358 --> 01:25:25.485
Music hits me so hard.

2019
01:25:25.527 --> 01:25:27.070
And I really got enflamed.

2020
01:25:27.112 --> 01:25:28.832
- "- His music"?
- And I remember calling up


2021
01:25:28.864 --> 01:25:30.407
my accountants and lawyers
and said,


2022
01:25:30.449 --> 01:25:31.783
"I really thought
I told you guys


2023
01:25:31.825 --> 01:25:33.344
not to let any more rappers
use my stuff."


2024
01:25:33.368 --> 01:25:34.828
I was yelling...

2025
01:25:34.870 --> 01:25:36.347
Then they said, you know,
"You're gonna be making


2026
01:25:36.371 --> 01:25:38.433
so many million dollars."
I said, "Okay, never mind."


2027
01:25:38.457 --> 01:25:40.500
Rick James is very,
very, very happy.


2028
01:25:40.542 --> 01:25:44.129
And because of my using

2029
01:25:44.171 --> 01:25:46.173
his music,

2030
01:25:46.214 --> 01:25:47.758
it has made him enough money

2031
01:25:47.799 --> 01:25:49.843
to buy a new Rolls-Royce
and a new house.


2032
01:25:49.885 --> 01:25:52.512
I told you, homeboy,
you can't touch this.


2033
01:25:52.554 --> 01:25:54.514
Hip hop gave a second life

2034
01:25:54.556 --> 01:25:56.058
to a lot of Black artists.

2035
01:25:56.099 --> 01:25:58.852
MC Hammer is
the most popular example.


2036
01:25:58.894 --> 01:26:00.646
- It's corny as hell.
- But it was huge.


2037
01:26:00.687 --> 01:26:02.522
Hammer beat everybody
to the punch.


2038
01:26:02.564 --> 01:26:04.983
To this day, if you put it on,

2039
01:26:05.025 --> 01:26:06.985
it'll get it
cracking up in here.


2040
01:26:07.027 --> 01:26:11.239
The irony is that he probably
made more money


2041
01:26:11.281 --> 01:26:13.325
from "U Can't Touch This"

2042
01:26:13.367 --> 01:26:17.162
than, you know, he made
on the original version


2043
01:26:17.204 --> 01:26:18.914
of "Super Freak."

2044
01:26:18.955 --> 01:26:20.749
I decided I wanted
to do another record.


2045
01:26:20.791 --> 01:26:22.584
So I signed
with Warner Brothers.


2046
01:26:22.626 --> 01:26:24.211
I did an album called
"Wonderful."


2047
01:26:24.252 --> 01:26:26.546
It had a number one
R&B single, "Loosey's Rap."


2048
01:26:26.588 --> 01:26:29.049
I know a chick,
her name is Loosey.


2049
01:26:31.259 --> 01:26:33.178
She's a freaky thang.

2050
01:26:33.220 --> 01:26:35.222
I was on the label
on Warner Brothers.


2051
01:26:35.263 --> 01:26:37.849
I'm Shanté, and the rhyme today.

2052
01:26:37.891 --> 01:26:40.560
Just rap so fresh
till I get out of breath.


2053
01:26:40.602 --> 01:26:41.913
They were like,
"Okay, well look, you need


2054
01:26:41.937 --> 01:26:44.022
to go and stay
with Rick for a little while,


2055
01:26:44.064 --> 01:26:46.400
and you guys are gonna
and work on a single together."


2056
01:26:46.441 --> 01:26:47.585
And I'm straight out
the group home.


2057
01:26:47.609 --> 01:26:49.069
I already have a baby.

2058
01:26:49.111 --> 01:26:51.488
I'm spending
so much time on tour,


2059
01:26:51.530 --> 01:26:53.073
I didn't even have
a home address.


2060
01:26:53.115 --> 01:26:55.575
So I'll go to Rick James'
house and stay.


2061
01:26:55.617 --> 01:26:57.703
A lady was also staying there,
and I take it


2062
01:26:57.744 --> 01:26:59.788
that she was Rick's wife,

2063
01:26:59.830 --> 01:27:02.374
girlfriend, live-in girlfriend,
or whatever.


2064
01:27:02.416 --> 01:27:04.209
And it's so sad,
because I was thinking


2065
01:27:04.251 --> 01:27:06.503
about this recently... like,
I never knew her name,


2066
01:27:06.545 --> 01:27:07.939
and I was there
for almost three months.


2067
01:27:07.963 --> 01:27:09.148
'Cause her called her "bitch."

2068
01:27:09.172 --> 01:27:10.757
"Bitch, get something
from the store."


2069
01:27:10.799 --> 01:27:12.235
"Bitch, go get them
something to eat."


2070
01:27:12.259 --> 01:27:13.635
"Bitch, such such such."

2071
01:27:13.677 --> 01:27:15.387
And, you know, she just, "Okay.

2072
01:27:15.429 --> 01:27:17.389
- Okay, Rick.
- Okay."


2073
01:27:17.431 --> 01:27:20.934
You know, and I knew
I didn't want to be that bitch.


2074
01:27:23.395 --> 01:27:25.397
Daddy had numerous girls.

2075
01:27:25.439 --> 01:27:28.316
There was always somebody
flying in and out.


2076
01:27:28.358 --> 01:27:31.945
You know, we'd go
to the local pizza shop,


2077
01:27:31.987 --> 01:27:34.114
and girls would be coming back.

2078
01:27:34.156 --> 01:27:36.074
I remember Tanya

2079
01:27:36.116 --> 01:27:38.368
coming to the house
for the first time.


2080
01:27:38.410 --> 01:27:41.580
- She was 17.
- She was the same age as me.


2081
01:27:41.621 --> 01:27:42.789
He comes in the house.

2082
01:27:42.831 --> 01:27:44.624
They're pratting in
from the airport.


2083
01:27:44.666 --> 01:27:46.102
- I pulled him to the side.
- "How old is she?"


2084
01:27:46.126 --> 01:27:47.377
"She's 21!"

2085
01:27:47.419 --> 01:27:50.046
I'm like, "Hmm. Okay."

2086
01:27:50.088 --> 01:27:53.300
When I met him,
I didn't feel like he was


2087
01:27:53.341 --> 01:27:55.093
so much older than me.

2088
01:27:55.135 --> 01:27:58.680
He definitely did not have
the spirit of a 39-year-old.


2089
01:27:58.722 --> 01:28:00.557
He didn't look like
a 39-year-old.


2090
01:28:00.599 --> 01:28:01.975
You know Black don't crack.

2091
01:28:02.017 --> 01:28:05.270
So he was 30, maybe.

2092
01:28:05.312 --> 01:28:08.607
And I was a precious 17, so.

2093
01:28:08.648 --> 01:28:11.943
If I would have been hip
to who he was,


2094
01:28:11.985 --> 01:28:13.361
we would not have connected.

2095
01:28:13.403 --> 01:28:15.238
Rick fell in love
with a young girl.


2096
01:28:15.280 --> 01:28:17.866
They just had a lot of sex
and shit...


2097
01:28:17.908 --> 01:28:20.535
People, whatnot,
parties with everybody naked.


2098
01:28:20.577 --> 01:28:22.162
She was too young
for me to be around.


2099
01:28:22.204 --> 01:28:23.955
I mean,
she was like a baby to me.


2100
01:28:23.997 --> 01:28:27.375
They both met
under the influence.


2101
01:28:27.417 --> 01:28:30.462
They proceeded to get together
under that same thing.


2102
01:28:30.504 --> 01:28:32.923
So I didn't think much of it.

2103
01:28:32.964 --> 01:28:34.591
I came damaged,

2104
01:28:34.633 --> 01:28:37.803
and Rick saw that damage in me
because he was damaged.


2105
01:28:37.844 --> 01:28:41.014
The reason we connected so well
was because, in a safe space,


2106
01:28:41.056 --> 01:28:42.516
we could be vulnerable together,

2107
01:28:42.557 --> 01:28:44.100
and both of our damage
connected,


2108
01:28:44.142 --> 01:28:47.687
because he had such
a fucking, like, image


2109
01:28:47.729 --> 01:28:49.523
that he couldn't even escape.

2110
01:28:49.564 --> 01:28:51.024
Like, he couldn't
escape that image.


2111
01:28:51.066 --> 01:28:53.235
He could escape it with me.

2112
01:28:55.070 --> 01:28:56.112
I bought this house.

2113
01:28:56.154 --> 01:28:57.948
It was at the top of Mulholland.

2114
01:28:57.989 --> 01:28:59.759
- Gorgeous home.
- And really, all it was for me


2115
01:28:59.783 --> 01:29:02.118
was just a place to get high.

2116
01:29:05.163 --> 01:29:08.583
I'd go out, and come home
with 20, 30 people,


2117
01:29:08.625 --> 01:29:11.795
19 of them I never met before,
and they'd stay for days.


2118
01:29:11.837 --> 01:29:13.397
And my life was pretty dark
at that time.


2119
01:29:13.421 --> 01:29:15.590
The house had really
turned into a crack haven.


2120
01:29:15.632 --> 01:29:18.426
A person who sniffs coke
and does things on a certain,


2121
01:29:18.468 --> 01:29:19.803
more expensive level,

2122
01:29:19.845 --> 01:29:21.847
won't have certain
people around them.


2123
01:29:21.888 --> 01:29:23.723
But a person who will
smoke crack is liable


2124
01:29:23.765 --> 01:29:25.433
to have anybody around them

2125
01:29:25.475 --> 01:29:27.352
because it becomes
an anybody drug.


2126
01:29:29.563 --> 01:29:32.732
It was a time that I was

2127
01:29:32.774 --> 01:29:35.360
trying to intercede a binge.

2128
01:29:35.402 --> 01:29:38.864
And my dad was on, like,
maybe... it was three


2129
01:29:38.905 --> 01:29:42.450
or four days
that we hadn't saw his face.


2130
01:29:42.492 --> 01:29:45.579
I called Val, and I was like,
"I'm going in the room."


2131
01:29:45.620 --> 01:29:47.497
I got there to the house.

2132
01:29:47.539 --> 01:29:50.250
We got a butter knife

2133
01:29:50.292 --> 01:29:54.004
out of the kitchen drawer,
and went in there.


2134
01:29:54.045 --> 01:29:55.922
We went looking around,

2135
01:29:55.964 --> 01:30:00.510
with women hiding
in the closet or in the shower.


2136
01:30:00.552 --> 01:30:01.928
I was like, "You gotta go.

2137
01:30:01.970 --> 01:30:03.763
- It's time to go.
- It's check-out time."


2138
01:30:03.805 --> 01:30:06.349
- Right?
- So he's still asleep.


2139
01:30:06.391 --> 01:30:09.519
And he woke up and just...

2140
01:30:09.561 --> 01:30:13.398
It was... it was pretty bad.

2141
01:30:13.440 --> 01:30:14.774
He started throwing things.

2142
01:30:14.816 --> 01:30:16.401
Then he threw at book at me.

2143
01:30:16.443 --> 01:30:18.904
I picked the book up
and threw it right back at him.


2144
01:30:18.945 --> 01:30:20.989
He was ducking.

2145
01:30:21.031 --> 01:30:23.617
He threw, like, a candlestick
or something,


2146
01:30:23.658 --> 01:30:25.076
and it cut my foot open.

2147
01:30:25.118 --> 01:30:28.663
I had to have stitches.

2148
01:30:28.705 --> 01:30:30.957
I wound up in the hospital.

2149
01:30:30.999 --> 01:30:33.001
I didn't talk to my dad
for eight months.


2150
01:30:33.043 --> 01:30:36.171
- That was the demon.
- That was the devil.


2151
01:30:36.212 --> 01:30:39.382
That was
drug-possessed James Johnson.


2152
01:30:41.551 --> 01:30:44.137
Pop singer Rick James
is being accused of


2153
01:30:44.179 --> 01:30:45.513
all kinds of terrible things,

2154
01:30:45.555 --> 01:30:47.682
and authorities are taking it
very seriously.


2155
01:30:47.724 --> 01:30:50.727
James is accused of
assault with a deadly weapon,


2156
01:30:50.769 --> 01:30:55.148
aggravated mayhem, torture,
and forceable oral copulation.


2157
01:30:55.190 --> 01:30:58.485
Arrested for assault
with great bodily injury


2158
01:30:58.526 --> 01:31:00.737
was Tanya Hijazi,

2159
01:31:00.779 --> 01:31:03.907
21 years of age, and Rick James.

2160
01:31:03.949 --> 01:31:05.659
The day that Rick got arrested,

2161
01:31:05.700 --> 01:31:07.452
I was called on that case.

2162
01:31:07.494 --> 01:31:11.414
Rick was accused of torturing
a girl with a crackpipe.


2163
01:31:14.042 --> 01:31:15.627
Hi, all these cameras.

2164
01:31:15.669 --> 01:31:17.337
I was shocked.

2165
01:31:17.379 --> 01:31:20.840
That broke my heart
when I saw the report on that.


2166
01:31:20.882 --> 01:31:22.801
He looked like he was scared.

2167
01:31:22.842 --> 01:31:25.845
Well, you know, I just hope
that phrase...


2168
01:31:25.887 --> 01:31:27.406
Innocent till proven guilty...
Is true.


2169
01:31:27.430 --> 01:31:29.033
I've kind of found,
since I've been in here,


2170
01:31:29.057 --> 01:31:32.352
it's like guilty
till proven innocent.


2171
01:31:32.394 --> 01:31:34.372
I've always been guilty
of things till proven innocent.


2172
01:31:34.396 --> 01:31:36.856
He was accused
of sexual assault,


2173
01:31:36.898 --> 01:31:41.653
and the girl was
pretty much partying


2174
01:31:41.695 --> 01:31:43.530
with them the whole time.

2175
01:31:43.571 --> 01:31:47.575
And I guess, you know,
when it was over,


2176
01:31:47.617 --> 01:31:49.995
she had a couple of burns.

2177
01:31:50.036 --> 01:31:52.080
Like, Tanya had some burns too.

2178
01:31:52.122 --> 01:31:55.875
This is something
that was condoned.


2179
01:31:55.917 --> 01:31:59.796
Frances Alley told us
about having been a visitor


2180
01:31:59.838 --> 01:32:01.381
at Rick James' home.

2181
01:32:01.423 --> 01:32:05.010
Everything got out of control
when he suspected her


2182
01:32:05.051 --> 01:32:09.222
of stealing
some kind of... some cocaine.


2183
01:32:09.264 --> 01:32:12.642
He tied her up to a chair
while she was nude,


2184
01:32:12.684 --> 01:32:17.397
and she said that he burned her
with a crack cocaine pipe,


2185
01:32:17.439 --> 01:32:20.066
and brought out a big butcher
knife from the kitchen,


2186
01:32:20.108 --> 01:32:22.485
after his girlfriend
warmed it up,


2187
01:32:22.527 --> 01:32:24.237
and put it against her leg.

2188
01:32:24.279 --> 01:32:26.406
Why would someone
make these stories up?


2189
01:32:26.448 --> 01:32:28.074
- Well, we...
- We'll take care of that.


2190
01:32:28.116 --> 01:32:29.868
We... Mr. James is gonna fight

2191
01:32:29.909 --> 01:32:31.411
this thing in court,
and we can't wait


2192
01:32:31.453 --> 01:32:33.139
- for the truth to come out.
- The truth will come out.


2193
01:32:33.163 --> 01:32:35.123
You don't force anyone
to do crack.


2194
01:32:35.165 --> 01:32:36.958
- You don't force them.
- People that I know,


2195
01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:38.585
that smoke crack, they'll go out

2196
01:32:38.626 --> 01:32:40.920
and sell their babies
for a hit of crack.


2197
01:32:40.962 --> 01:32:42.231
And she said I forced her
to have sex.


2198
01:32:42.255 --> 01:32:43.590
I never forced her to have sex.

2199
01:32:43.631 --> 01:32:45.431
I never forced a woman
in my life to have sex.


2200
01:32:45.467 --> 01:32:47.594
If anything, I gotta force
them not to have sex.


2201
01:32:47.635 --> 01:32:49.971
What sprang out
of that adversity


2202
01:32:50.013 --> 01:32:52.807
was our connection.

2203
01:32:52.849 --> 01:32:55.060
"The witch hunt
that is happening


2204
01:32:55.101 --> 01:32:56.644
right now is serious,

2205
01:32:56.686 --> 01:32:59.773
and we need to stick together,

2206
01:32:59.814 --> 01:33:02.484
and I need to protect this man,

2207
01:33:02.525 --> 01:33:04.736
and he needs to protect me,

2208
01:33:04.778 --> 01:33:07.197
because this is
some foul shit."


2209
01:33:07.238 --> 01:33:09.282
I hated to see him
catch that case,


2210
01:33:09.324 --> 01:33:12.368
- because he didn't need that.
- But was he capable of that?


2211
01:33:12.410 --> 01:33:14.954
Any addict
is capable of anything.


2212
01:33:14.996 --> 01:33:17.791
You can do some subhuman stuff,
and that's just the way it is.


2213
01:33:17.832 --> 01:33:21.294
That didn't seem like
the person I knew at all.


2214
01:33:21.336 --> 01:33:24.089
We did our fair share
of partying, that's for sure.


2215
01:33:24.130 --> 01:33:26.883
But nothing, I mean,
nothing of that sort.


2216
01:33:26.925 --> 01:33:28.134
I just worry about it.

2217
01:33:28.176 --> 01:33:30.386
That's the only thing
I can tell you.


2218
01:33:30.428 --> 01:33:32.764
And I think I'll never give up
praying about it...


2219
01:33:32.806 --> 01:33:34.557
That he will stop,

2220
01:33:34.599 --> 01:33:37.185
or if he not doing,
don't do it anymore.


2221
01:33:37.227 --> 01:33:38.853
When my mother was dying,

2222
01:33:38.895 --> 01:33:40.438
and me and my brother Roy

2223
01:33:40.480 --> 01:33:43.441
was calling him to come,
he was in California,


2224
01:33:43.483 --> 01:33:45.211
and we was calling him...
We was threatening him


2225
01:33:45.235 --> 01:33:46.778
we'd come and get him,

2226
01:33:46.820 --> 01:33:49.030
because she was that
tied to him.


2227
01:33:49.072 --> 01:33:51.866
And he was out there
getting high.


2228
01:33:51.908 --> 01:33:53.284
And we called him and told him,

2229
01:33:53.326 --> 01:33:54.828
"Hey, we gotta come
and get your ass.


2230
01:33:54.869 --> 01:33:56.097
We're gonna come
and get you, man."


2231
01:33:56.121 --> 01:33:57.723
And then he came on back,
and he was fucked up


2232
01:33:57.747 --> 01:33:59.833
- when he came.
- Excuse my French.


2233
01:34:01.459 --> 01:34:03.169
When I went to Buffalo
to see her,


2234
01:34:03.211 --> 01:34:05.106
- she was already dying.
- She was just hanging on.


2235
01:34:05.130 --> 01:34:07.966
She was in a coma
for like three or four days.


2236
01:34:08.007 --> 01:34:09.276
She really didn't
want to leave, you know.


2237
01:34:09.300 --> 01:34:10.528
She didn't want to let go
till, like,


2238
01:34:10.552 --> 01:34:12.846
she saw all her kids, you know.

2239
01:34:12.887 --> 01:34:14.639
And I was, like, the loneliest,

2240
01:34:14.681 --> 01:34:16.516
empty person in the world.

2241
01:34:16.558 --> 01:34:18.935
That was the beginning
of the downfall.


2242
01:34:18.977 --> 01:34:20.687
And the depression
was a constant


2243
01:34:20.728 --> 01:34:22.272
within, you know, that.

2244
01:34:22.313 --> 01:34:24.190
Even though they had
all these headlines


2245
01:34:24.232 --> 01:34:26.526
about Rick was facing
life imprisonment,


2246
01:34:26.568 --> 01:34:29.946
they agreed to drop
all the serious felony charges,


2247
01:34:29.988 --> 01:34:34.200
and Rick was able to get a year
in drug rehab as his sentence.


2248
01:34:34.242 --> 01:34:37.203
While we were still
wrapping up our case,


2249
01:34:37.245 --> 01:34:39.956
Rick picked up another case,
Mary Sauger.


2250
01:34:39.998 --> 01:34:42.125
He basically slammed me
against the wall,


2251
01:34:42.167 --> 01:34:44.752
started strangling me, and...

2252
01:34:44.794 --> 01:34:47.380
the fists, the... everything.

2253
01:34:47.422 --> 01:34:49.507
It just went on repeatedly
for hours and hours.


2254
01:34:49.549 --> 01:34:51.509
And then at one point,
I was knocked unconscious.


2255
01:34:51.551 --> 01:34:54.262
I went to a hotel room
to get away for a while.


2256
01:34:54.304 --> 01:34:56.598
- And Tanya joined me there.
- This girl came over.


2257
01:34:56.639 --> 01:34:58.141
And two days went by,

2258
01:34:58.183 --> 01:34:59.451
and we were all pretty drunk,
pretty high.


2259
01:34:59.475 --> 01:35:01.019
Her and Tanya got into a fight.

2260
01:35:01.060 --> 01:35:02.729
- She smacked Tanya.
- Tanya smacked her.


2261
01:35:02.770 --> 01:35:04.230
And she kicked Tanya.

2262
01:35:04.272 --> 01:35:05.624
Well, when the girl tried
to kick Tanya,


2263
01:35:05.648 --> 01:35:08.026
- that ticked me off.
- I went into the girl.


2264
01:35:08.067 --> 01:35:10.069
Yeah, I laid hands on this girl.

2265
01:35:10.111 --> 01:35:11.613
The codefendant, Tanya,

2266
01:35:11.654 --> 01:35:13.156
has pled guilty today,

2267
01:35:13.198 --> 01:35:15.325
and she's serving four years
in state prison


2268
01:35:15.366 --> 01:35:17.577
when she surrenders, and
that's gonna be in a month.


2269
01:35:17.619 --> 01:35:19.370
And he's facing
two torture charges


2270
01:35:19.412 --> 01:35:21.748
and one charge
of aggravated mayhem.


2271
01:35:21.789 --> 01:35:24.751
Those three counts alone
are life sentences.


2272
01:35:24.792 --> 01:35:27.253
There was so much shit
that hit the fan,


2273
01:35:27.295 --> 01:35:29.505
all immediately,
all at one time.


2274
01:35:29.547 --> 01:35:31.925
And there was no time to think.

2275
01:35:31.966 --> 01:35:33.885
You just acted on judgment.

2276
01:35:33.927 --> 01:35:36.930
And my judgment
was to go all-in with this man


2277
01:35:36.971 --> 01:35:41.100
because I knew that he didn't
deserve what was going on.


2278
01:35:41.142 --> 01:35:42.602
You know, I was in,
like, a dream.


2279
01:35:42.644 --> 01:35:44.121
- I couldn't believe it.
- You know, I was getting high


2280
01:35:44.145 --> 01:35:45.521
every night before the trial,

2281
01:35:45.563 --> 01:35:48.066
- falling asleep at court.
- I'm snoring.


2282
01:35:48.107 --> 01:35:51.444
Because I was just in a daze
that this was happening.


2283
01:35:51.486 --> 01:35:52.737
When I was watching him,

2284
01:35:52.779 --> 01:35:54.072
when he was in court,

2285
01:35:54.113 --> 01:35:55.740
and he was nodding
and carrying on,


2286
01:35:55.782 --> 01:35:57.242
that said a lot, basically.

2287
01:35:57.283 --> 01:35:59.953
That was just too much

2288
01:35:59.994 --> 01:36:01.579
for anyone to deal with.

2289
01:36:01.621 --> 01:36:03.831
And then times
were changing too.


2290
01:36:03.873 --> 01:36:06.251
It was like, "Rick, ain't
nobody doing this shit no more.


2291
01:36:06.292 --> 01:36:08.253
Everybody grows up
at some point.


2292
01:36:08.294 --> 01:36:10.880
I mean,
you still doing this stuff?"


2293
01:36:10.922 --> 01:36:13.216
I think it was totally
taken out of context.


2294
01:36:13.258 --> 01:36:15.385
But it was what it was.

2295
01:36:15.426 --> 01:36:17.387
What matters is that
he's in court.


2296
01:36:17.428 --> 01:36:19.472
He's got to fight it,
and if he loses,


2297
01:36:19.514 --> 01:36:21.116
he could be in jail
for the rest of his life.


2298
01:36:21.140 --> 01:36:23.476
We, the jury, in the above
entitled action,


2299
01:36:23.518 --> 01:36:25.979
find the defendant Rick James

2300
01:36:26.020 --> 01:36:28.314
guilty of the crime of sale...

2301
01:36:28.356 --> 01:36:31.109
They ended up giving
five years, four months.


2302
01:36:31.150 --> 01:36:32.986
That's when I went
to Folsom Prison.


2303
01:36:33.569 --> 01:36:36.281
This was a serious,
strange transition.


2304
01:36:36.322 --> 01:36:38.825
As much as I thought it was
a curse and a terrible thing,


2305
01:36:38.866 --> 01:36:40.785
it turned out to be
a beautiful blessing.


2306
01:36:40.827 --> 01:36:43.180
I'm thankful to God to let me
have prison as an alternative,


2307
01:36:43.204 --> 01:36:44.497
as opposed to the grave,

2308
01:36:44.539 --> 01:36:46.499
'cause I was headed
to the grave.


2309
01:36:46.541 --> 01:36:48.251
He chose to be Muslim

2310
01:36:48.293 --> 01:36:50.086
when he was in prison.

2311
01:36:50.128 --> 01:36:51.587
It didn't last long.

2312
01:36:51.629 --> 01:36:55.091
But a lot of that
was understand himself.


2313
01:36:55.133 --> 01:36:58.594
He felt, too, like
the Rick James persona... like,


2314
01:36:58.636 --> 01:37:00.680
- he's not Rick James.
- He's James Ambrose Johnson.


2315
01:37:00.722 --> 01:37:02.390
When Tanya was in prison,

2316
01:37:02.432 --> 01:37:04.309
we used to write letters
to each other a lot.


2317
01:37:04.350 --> 01:37:06.769
We needed to stop doing drugs
for our son.


2318
01:37:06.811 --> 01:37:09.105
Even though we were up
against all this bullshit,


2319
01:37:09.147 --> 01:37:11.607
we were bringing life
into the world,


2320
01:37:11.649 --> 01:37:13.568
and it was a very special time
for us.


2321
01:37:13.609 --> 01:37:15.236
Literally, like,

2322
01:37:15.278 --> 01:37:18.448
the rose that grew
through the concrete,


2323
01:37:18.489 --> 01:37:20.742
'cause we were facing
some really heavy shit,


2324
01:37:20.783 --> 01:37:24.954
but we were giving birth
to a magnificent spirit.


2325
01:37:24.996 --> 01:37:27.665
Tazman grounded him a lot.

2326
01:37:27.707 --> 01:37:32.045
He got a second chance
at being a father.


2327
01:37:32.086 --> 01:37:34.505
Funk musician Rick James
is a free man


2328
01:37:34.547 --> 01:37:36.841
after spending
three years in prison.


2329
01:37:36.883 --> 01:37:38.718
The first thing James did
when he was released


2330
01:37:38.760 --> 01:37:41.637
was to hug
his four-year-old son.


2331
01:37:41.679 --> 01:37:44.515
He says his prison time
was well-spent, though.


2332
01:37:44.557 --> 01:37:47.560
He got off drugs
and wrote 400 songs.


2333
01:37:47.602 --> 01:37:49.187
There was so much pain
inside of me.


2334
01:37:49.228 --> 01:37:51.564
And there was so many things
that I wanted to say.


2335
01:37:51.606 --> 01:37:53.358
It's like when I started,
you know?


2336
01:37:53.399 --> 01:37:55.568
I had that hunger again.

2337
01:37:55.610 --> 01:37:57.250
Plus I was going broke,
and I needed to...


2338
01:37:58.363 --> 01:37:59.530
I had a hard time, you know,

2339
01:37:59.572 --> 01:38:00.758
'cause a lot of record companies

2340
01:38:00.782 --> 01:38:02.575
didn't want to take
a chance on me.


2341
01:38:02.617 --> 01:38:04.928
- So I just said, "Fuck it.
- I'm gonna make my own album."


2342
01:38:04.952 --> 01:38:07.622
I just wanted to go back to
the roots of what I was about.


2343
01:38:07.663 --> 01:38:11.417
Once he got out of prison,
he called me, and he said,


2344
01:38:11.459 --> 01:38:13.920
"I want to get
the original Stone City Band


2345
01:38:13.961 --> 01:38:16.047
- back together.
- Come on over."


2346
01:38:16.089 --> 01:38:17.548
And I'm just like,
"Wait a minute.


2347
01:38:17.590 --> 01:38:19.717
I have a job, you know."
He said, "No, no, no.


2348
01:38:19.759 --> 01:38:21.761
You've got to get down here
right now."


2349
01:38:21.803 --> 01:38:22.804
And he just did that.

2350
01:38:22.845 --> 01:38:24.722
So when he says that,
you do that.


2351
01:38:24.764 --> 01:38:26.391
Everything was business
as usual.


2352
01:38:26.432 --> 01:38:28.476
- He was normal.
- He wasn't high.


2353
01:38:28.518 --> 01:38:30.645
- I thought it was a great album.
- We went on tour.


2354
01:38:34.107 --> 01:38:36.609
Give it to me baby,
give it to me baby.


2355
01:38:36.651 --> 01:38:39.028
As soon as he got out of jail,

2356
01:38:39.070 --> 01:38:42.740
my job was to make sure
he didn't get high.


2357
01:38:42.782 --> 01:38:44.951
I put him on a few shows,
and he would go on there,


2358
01:38:44.992 --> 01:38:47.537
and people would say,
"Oh, my gosh. Rick is clean.


2359
01:38:47.578 --> 01:38:50.039
- He's smart. He's intelligent.
- And he was clear."


2360
01:38:50.081 --> 01:38:52.250
But during this time period,

2361
01:38:52.291 --> 01:38:55.711
my phone stopped ringing
as a manager,


2362
01:38:55.753 --> 01:38:58.631
because people didn't want
to see a clean Rick James.


2363
01:38:58.673 --> 01:39:01.384
They wanted to see
a Super Freak.


2364
01:39:01.426 --> 01:39:03.010
Hey, man.-

2365
01:39:03.052 --> 01:39:04.345
Hey. What's up?

2366
01:39:05.513 --> 01:39:08.349
Nice girls dude.

2367
01:39:08.391 --> 01:39:10.685
This man lost a serious
guitar of minute.


2368
01:39:10.726 --> 01:39:12.311
That's not the issue with you.

2369
01:39:12.353 --> 01:39:13.622
Okay? And that is the issue
that I'm dealing with.


2370
01:39:13.646 --> 01:39:14.873
That's not what you bringing up.

2371
01:39:14.897 --> 01:39:16.482
You bringing up
a character reference.


2372
01:39:16.524 --> 01:39:18.901
- Well, are you not gay?
- Hold on. Hold on.


2373
01:39:18.943 --> 01:39:20.212
That's got nothing
to do with nothing.


2374
01:39:20.236 --> 01:39:21.946
You don't ask me
my personal business.


2375
01:39:21.988 --> 01:39:23.531
But, at the same time,

2376
01:39:23.573 --> 01:39:25.950
he turned back
into that lifestyle.


2377
01:39:27.702 --> 01:39:30.538
Rick was always
the champion of the underdogs


2378
01:39:30.580 --> 01:39:32.832
but never of himself.

2379
01:39:32.874 --> 01:39:35.710
He would stay sober

2380
01:39:35.751 --> 01:39:38.463
for very short, sporadic times,

2381
01:39:38.504 --> 01:39:41.299
but it was until
he could not bear


2382
01:39:41.340 --> 01:39:43.718
the depression anymore.

2383
01:39:43.759 --> 01:39:47.138
He would stay sober for a month
to three months, at the most.


2384
01:39:47.180 --> 01:39:50.349
I've never seen Rick sober
for more than three months.


2385
01:39:50.391 --> 01:39:52.685
Rick went to over 30 rehabs.

2386
01:39:52.727 --> 01:39:55.271
Rick was constantly
trying to get clean.


2387
01:39:55.313 --> 01:39:58.191
He wanted to be his potential.

2388
01:39:58.232 --> 01:40:01.360
His addiction was the bane
of his existence.


2389
01:40:01.402 --> 01:40:04.113
He was a tortured soul.

2390
01:40:04.155 --> 01:40:07.533
Most of our marriage was spent
at Cedars-Sinai Hospital,


2391
01:40:07.575 --> 01:40:09.035
dealing with
his health problems.


2392
01:40:09.076 --> 01:40:10.328
My husband asked me

2393
01:40:10.369 --> 01:40:12.038
to come out here
and talk to you guys.


2394
01:40:12.079 --> 01:40:13.789
He suffered a stroke.

2395
01:40:13.831 --> 01:40:15.958
He had a pacemaker installed.

2396
01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.711
His doctor told him,
"You gotta stop doing drugs."


2397
01:40:18.753 --> 01:40:21.714
And he just lived the way
he wanted to live,


2398
01:40:21.756 --> 01:40:23.716
till the wheels fell off.

2399
01:40:23.758 --> 01:40:26.719
His dopamine,
his adrenaline was gone,


2400
01:40:26.761 --> 01:40:29.847
and the only way it would be
brought back up again


2401
01:40:29.889 --> 01:40:31.224
was with cocaine.

2402
01:40:31.265 --> 01:40:33.559
Cocaine had stolen

2403
01:40:33.601 --> 01:40:37.188
all of his pleasure centers
in his brain.


2404
01:40:37.230 --> 01:40:38.856
Cocaine is a hell of a drug.

2405
01:40:41.150 --> 01:40:42.860
In the early 2000s,

2406
01:40:42.902 --> 01:40:45.571
Rick James is not
really thought of a lot.


2407
01:40:45.613 --> 01:40:48.574
In 2004,
on the Dave Chappelle show,


2408
01:40:48.616 --> 01:40:50.576
there's a skit about Rick James.

2409
01:40:50.618 --> 01:40:52.620
Ladies and gentlemen,
make some noise...


2410
01:40:52.662 --> 01:40:54.747
"Charlie Murphy's
True Hollywood Stories."


2411
01:40:54.789 --> 01:40:56.749
I was a huge Rick James fan.

2412
01:40:56.791 --> 01:40:58.751
That's the first person
that I would say,


2413
01:40:58.793 --> 01:41:01.003
out of all the celebrities
that I met,


2414
01:41:01.045 --> 01:41:02.588
that I was
-I was starstruck.

2415
01:41:02.630 --> 01:41:03.690
- Come on, babe.
- Just show me your titties.


2416
01:41:03.714 --> 01:41:05.591
- I'm Rick James.
- Do something.


2417
01:41:05.633 --> 01:41:08.219
Mm. Mm.

2418
01:41:08.261 --> 01:41:09.929
I wish I had more hands,

2419
01:41:09.971 --> 01:41:13.015
so I could give those titties
four thumbs down.


2420
01:41:13.057 --> 01:41:15.601
What Dave Chappelle did
with the Rick James character...


2421
01:41:15.643 --> 01:41:18.271
You know, it really showed you,
like,


2422
01:41:18.312 --> 01:41:20.106
what Rick James'
personality was.


2423
01:41:20.147 --> 01:41:23.609
Rick James didn't give a fuck.

2424
01:41:23.651 --> 01:41:25.778
And Dave Chappelle
embodied that.


2425
01:41:25.820 --> 01:41:26.904
- Charlie!
- What's up, man?


2426
01:41:26.946 --> 01:41:28.239
There's a new joke going around.

2427
01:41:28.281 --> 01:41:30.491
Have you heard it?

2428
01:41:30.533 --> 01:41:33.160
What did the five fingers
say to the face?


2429
01:41:34.537 --> 01:41:36.455
- What?
- Slap!


2430
01:41:38.374 --> 01:41:39.625
I'm Rick James, bitch.

2431
01:41:39.667 --> 01:41:40.751
In that moment,

2432
01:41:40.793 --> 01:41:42.295
being in the studio, I was like,

2433
01:41:42.336 --> 01:41:45.756
"This is a sketch that people
are gonna be talking about


2434
01:41:45.798 --> 01:41:47.633
and remembering
for the rest of their lives."


2435
01:41:47.675 --> 01:41:49.635
That sketch was so powerful,

2436
01:41:49.677 --> 01:41:51.971
it had grade school kids
getting suspended.


2437
01:41:52.013 --> 01:41:54.473
They was going to school,
lunchroom, cafeteria,


2438
01:41:54.515 --> 01:41:56.601
any chance they had...
"I'm Rick James, bitch."


2439
01:41:56.642 --> 01:41:58.978
I must be losing my mind.

2440
01:41:59.020 --> 01:42:01.981
Reminiscing about Charlie
Murphy jump kicking my ass.


2441
01:42:03.190 --> 01:42:04.609
Ain't that a B.

2442
01:42:04.650 --> 01:42:06.128
"I'm Rick James, bitch"
wasn't funny to me,


2443
01:42:06.152 --> 01:42:08.070
'cause all it made him
was a caricature,


2444
01:42:08.112 --> 01:42:10.740
- as far as I was concerned.
- They made him out of a toy,


2445
01:42:10.781 --> 01:42:13.075
as opposed to a real live man,
human being.


2446
01:42:13.117 --> 01:42:15.077
A lot of that was true.

2447
01:42:15.119 --> 01:42:19.165
Rick would actually do
that... come in and talk shit.


2448
01:42:19.206 --> 01:42:21.000
That was Rick, all the way.

2449
01:42:21.042 --> 01:42:23.252
In the beginning,
his attitude was,


2450
01:42:23.294 --> 01:42:24.754
"Oh, well that's kind of cute.

2451
01:42:24.795 --> 01:42:26.106
- It doesn't matter. It's TV.
- It's comedy."


2452
01:42:26.130 --> 01:42:27.840
But then it got to be
a whole thing.


2453
01:42:27.882 --> 01:42:30.301
He might have imagined
that he was being mocked.


2454
01:42:30.343 --> 01:42:33.054
And yet, at the same time,
he was so interested


2455
01:42:33.095 --> 01:42:36.641
in maintaining
his own forward momentum,


2456
01:42:36.682 --> 01:42:39.143
that he took advantage
of that mockery


2457
01:42:39.185 --> 01:42:40.871
and turned it into something
that would work for him.


2458
01:42:40.895 --> 01:42:42.521
Never mind who you thought
I was.


2459
01:42:42.563 --> 01:42:44.565
I'm Rick James, bitch.

2460
01:42:46.067 --> 01:42:47.860
He uses the very catchphrase

2461
01:42:47.902 --> 01:42:49.654
that could have been used
against him


2462
01:42:49.695 --> 01:42:52.073
to help brand him
in a different way.


2463
01:42:52.114 --> 01:42:54.533
That was really the source of
Rick James' renewed popularity


2464
01:42:54.575 --> 01:42:56.035
in the early 2000s.

2465
01:42:56.077 --> 01:42:58.287
Love.

2466
01:43:03.668 --> 01:43:07.838
Them and leave them.

2467
01:43:07.880 --> 01:43:09.632
Yes!

2468
01:43:09.674 --> 01:43:12.051
That's what I used to do.

2469
01:43:12.093 --> 01:43:13.844
Sing the song.

2470
01:43:13.886 --> 01:43:18.349
I used to use
and abuse them, baby.


2471
01:43:18.391 --> 01:43:19.558
That music awards thing

2472
01:43:19.600 --> 01:43:20.893
he was on... he was nothing.

2473
01:43:20.935 --> 01:43:23.729
- The voice was gone.
- Everything was gone.


2474
01:43:23.771 --> 01:43:25.398
He was nothing
but a shell there.


2475
01:43:25.439 --> 01:43:27.233
That hurt. That hurt.

2476
01:43:27.274 --> 01:43:29.402
But most people
saw that as a great,


2477
01:43:29.443 --> 01:43:30.528
big moment.

2478
01:43:30.569 --> 01:43:32.738
Yeah, well...

2479
01:43:32.780 --> 01:43:35.533
I saw it as, like,
the bitter end.


2480
01:43:35.574 --> 01:43:37.576
I knew something
was gonna happen.


2481
01:43:37.618 --> 01:43:41.706
Bass chords.

2482
01:43:41.747 --> 01:43:43.916
I think that by that time,

2483
01:43:43.958 --> 01:43:47.128
he was bored
with the whole thing.


2484
01:43:47.169 --> 01:43:51.090
It's kind of like anyone who
gets money or stuff or a woman.


2485
01:43:51.132 --> 01:43:53.467
You think it's going
to change things,


2486
01:43:53.509 --> 01:43:55.928
and the change begins within.

2487
01:43:55.970 --> 01:43:58.347
And I don't think Rick
really knew that.


2488
01:43:58.389 --> 01:44:03.144
He kept looking outward
for some salvation.


2489
01:44:03.185 --> 01:44:05.604
And he just never found it.

2490
01:44:05.646 --> 01:44:07.481
The times I saw Rick,
after jail,


2491
01:44:07.523 --> 01:44:09.108
I left with a broken heart.

2492
01:44:09.150 --> 01:44:12.069
I felt as though I don't know
if he can live a lot longer.


2493
01:44:13.988 --> 01:44:16.073
Grammy Award-winning
singer Rick James


2494
01:44:16.115 --> 01:44:19.410
- found dead in his home.
- Rick James was 56 years old.


2495
01:44:19.452 --> 01:44:20.786
My father called me first

2496
01:44:20.828 --> 01:44:22.288
and told me Rick was gone.

2497
01:44:22.329 --> 01:44:23.873
And man, we cried.

2498
01:44:23.914 --> 01:44:27.460
God damn,
we cried over that phone, man.


2499
01:44:27.501 --> 01:44:29.295
And it still fucks with me.

2500
01:44:29.336 --> 01:44:32.381
I was in Florida,
and I was coming off the plane.


2501
01:44:32.423 --> 01:44:34.759
I looked up on the news screen,

2502
01:44:34.800 --> 01:44:37.803
coming from the airport, CNN,

2503
01:44:37.845 --> 01:44:40.806
and it had "Rick James dead."
They was taking his body.


2504
01:44:40.848 --> 01:44:42.892
He had nine drugs in his system.

2505
01:44:42.933 --> 01:44:45.936
- Nine.
- Among them, Xanax,


2506
01:44:45.978 --> 01:44:49.273
Valium, Vicodin,
crystal meth, and cocaine.


2507
01:44:49.315 --> 01:44:51.525
I went right the fuck there.

2508
01:44:51.567 --> 01:44:53.986
Like, immediately, I was on it.

2509
01:44:54.028 --> 01:44:56.739
Security at the place
that he was at


2510
01:44:56.781 --> 01:44:59.700
- were not letting us in.
- So I hopped the gate.


2511
01:44:59.742 --> 01:45:02.787
I'm running, because the place
that he was at


2512
01:45:02.828 --> 01:45:05.664
was a little bit further in
from the security gate.


2513
01:45:05.706 --> 01:45:08.250
And security is, like,
"Stop! Stop!"


2514
01:45:08.292 --> 01:45:10.836
And I was like,
"If you want to talk to me,


2515
01:45:10.878 --> 01:45:12.963
you better start running,
because I'm not stopping."


2516
01:45:13.005 --> 01:45:17.259
I got there, and he was dead.

2517
01:45:17.301 --> 01:45:22.181
I just remember
going in the room,


2518
01:45:22.223 --> 01:45:26.685
and he was still in the bed,
where he passed.


2519
01:45:26.727 --> 01:45:29.855
And I just wanted
to be next to him.


2520
01:45:29.897 --> 01:45:33.526
And I laid there
for about an hour,


2521
01:45:33.567 --> 01:45:35.027
just holding his hand,

2522
01:45:35.069 --> 01:45:38.989
before they came to pick him up.

2523
01:45:39.031 --> 01:45:42.535
And everything was chaotic

2524
01:45:42.576 --> 01:45:44.870
outside of us, and I just said,

2525
01:45:44.912 --> 01:45:48.207
- "- Close the door.
- I don't want anybody in here."


2526
01:45:48.249 --> 01:45:50.125
I don't think he tried
to OD, man.


2527
01:45:50.167 --> 01:45:52.253
- He loved being alive.
- We had things to do.


2528
01:45:52.294 --> 01:45:53.879
We were ready to go back
on the road.


2529
01:45:53.921 --> 01:45:55.840
That means we going back
in the studio.


2530
01:45:55.881 --> 01:45:57.341
Come over for some fresh shit.

2531
01:45:57.383 --> 01:46:00.094
Man, we... oh, we would have
killed them the next time out.


2532
01:46:00.135 --> 01:46:02.596
- We never got there.
- Almost.


2533
01:46:04.181 --> 01:46:05.850
I love you, Rick, for the time

2534
01:46:05.891 --> 01:46:08.477
that you stood
with my brother Calvin,


2535
01:46:08.519 --> 01:46:10.646
and the fun that y'all had
and the fun we had,


2536
01:46:10.688 --> 01:46:12.773
and the songs that you heard
of mine, that you said,


2537
01:46:12.815 --> 01:46:14.334
"Nah, I don't think
that's good enough.


2538
01:46:14.358 --> 01:46:15.878
You gotta do
something else with that."


2539
01:46:16.819 --> 01:46:19.196
I will forever be linked

2540
01:46:19.238 --> 01:46:20.990
in the archives

2541
01:46:21.031 --> 01:46:25.494
of R&B history with this man.

2542
01:46:25.536 --> 01:46:27.997
I love that people
came out to honor him


2543
01:46:28.038 --> 01:46:29.748
at the day of his death.

2544
01:46:29.790 --> 01:46:32.751
My contention is, though, with
all these powerful friends,


2545
01:46:32.793 --> 01:46:35.504
compadres, and connections...

2546
01:46:35.546 --> 01:46:37.923
When he was needing help,

2547
01:46:37.965 --> 01:46:40.259
when he was having trouble,

2548
01:46:40.301 --> 01:46:41.844
where were these people?

2549
01:46:41.886 --> 01:46:44.054
Wasn't Mr. Perfect,
by far.


2550
01:46:44.096 --> 01:46:45.514
You know, he had
all the fallacies.


2551
01:46:45.556 --> 01:46:47.433
But he was a good guy,

2552
01:46:47.474 --> 01:46:49.518
and a very talented guy.

2553
01:46:49.560 --> 01:46:52.062
And I think that
if he would have been able


2554
01:46:52.104 --> 01:46:54.940
to shake that demon,
would still be strong today.


2555
01:46:54.982 --> 01:46:57.359
Even in the adversity,

2556
01:46:57.401 --> 01:46:58.611
I learned a lot from him,

2557
01:46:58.652 --> 01:47:00.696
- and I'm grateful.
- I'm still... I mean,


2558
01:47:00.738 --> 01:47:04.408
- I'm older now.
- We mature... excuse me.


2559
01:47:06.619 --> 01:47:09.663
I told JoJo, "If Rick were here,

2560
01:47:09.705 --> 01:47:12.416
and he asked me tomorrow,

2561
01:47:12.458 --> 01:47:13.834
'Why don't you come back?

2562
01:47:13.876 --> 01:47:16.003
We're taking the band
back out, ' I'd go."


2563
01:47:30.726 --> 01:47:32.269
It took a lot of work,

2564
01:47:32.311 --> 01:47:34.104
because we were
all over the place.


2565
01:47:34.146 --> 01:47:36.315
I think because
we really realized


2566
01:47:36.357 --> 01:47:38.734
we're getting to the point
to where people


2567
01:47:38.776 --> 01:47:43.238
are asking for Rick's music
in a genuine sense again.


2568
01:47:43.280 --> 01:47:45.160
So we got together and said,
"Hey. Let's do it."


2569
01:47:45.199 --> 01:47:48.243
- It feels great.
- I love to play.


2570
01:47:48.285 --> 01:47:50.496
You know, that's
what we're are. We're players.


2571
01:47:50.537 --> 01:47:52.331
So without further ado,
I need everybody


2572
01:47:52.373 --> 01:47:53.499
to stand to your feet,

2573
01:47:53.540 --> 01:47:55.626
so we can bring them out
the Buffalo way.


2574
01:47:55.668 --> 01:47:57.670
Make some noise for my boys,

2575
01:47:57.711 --> 01:48:02.758
the Stone City Band!

2576
01:48:21.110 --> 01:48:23.362
Buffalo, are you in the house?

2577
01:48:23.404 --> 01:48:26.365
Guess who's back up in here
this evening.


2578
01:48:26.407 --> 01:48:28.158
We got the original boys.

2579
01:48:28.200 --> 01:48:29.535
Stone City Band.

2580
01:48:40.921 --> 01:48:42.881
What y'all smoking?

2581
01:48:43.674 --> 01:48:45.551
Oh, yeah

2582
01:48:45.592 --> 01:48:48.178
I'm in love with Mary Jane.

2583
01:48:48.220 --> 01:48:50.889
She's my main thing.

2584
01:48:50.931 --> 01:48:53.559
She makes me feel alright.

2585
01:48:53.600 --> 01:48:56.145
She makes my heart sing.

2586
01:48:56.186 --> 01:48:58.564
And when I'm feeling low.

2587
01:48:58.605 --> 01:49:01.525
She comes as no surprise.

2588
01:49:01.567 --> 01:49:03.944
Turns me on with her love.

2589
01:49:03.986 --> 01:49:09.158
Takes me to paradise.

2590
01:49:10.659 --> 01:49:13.746
Do you love me Mary Jane?

2591
01:49:13.787 --> 01:49:16.206
Had you become
the Rick James character?


2592
01:49:16.248 --> 01:49:17.767
- Yeah.
- I think that was the problem,


2593
01:49:17.791 --> 01:49:20.294
was I was trying to live out
the Rick James character.


2594
01:49:20.335 --> 01:49:22.022
And if you try to hang out with
Rick James, you're in trouble.


2595
01:49:22.046 --> 01:49:23.964
Mary Jane.

2596
01:49:24.006 --> 01:49:27.342
Don't you play no games.

2597
01:49:28.719 --> 01:49:31.305
Mary Jane.

2598
01:49:31.346 --> 01:49:34.349
I love her just the same.

2599
01:49:34.391 --> 01:49:35.976
Mary Jane.

2600
01:49:39.688 --> 01:49:41.857
I was at a party.

2601
01:49:41.899 --> 01:49:45.360
I think I might
have been, like, 14.


2602
01:49:45.402 --> 01:49:49.114
- And everybody was rapping.
- And I started rapping.


2603
01:49:49.156 --> 01:49:53.911
And the whole crowd
of people spun around,


2604
01:49:53.952 --> 01:49:55.871
and all of a sudden
I was just, like,


2605
01:49:55.913 --> 01:49:57.539
in the middle of this crowd,

2606
01:49:57.581 --> 01:49:59.917
and they're all, like,
so mesmerized.


2607
01:49:59.958 --> 01:50:01.144
That was the first time I was,
like "Whoa.


2608
01:50:01.168 --> 01:50:02.961
Maybe I can do this shit."

2609
01:50:03.003 --> 01:50:04.546
'Cause I saw my dad do it
for so long.


2610
01:50:04.588 --> 01:50:06.965
No matter what you say
about how he lived,


2611
01:50:07.007 --> 01:50:09.218
you know, drug-wise,
sex-wise, whatever,


2612
01:50:09.259 --> 01:50:11.303
but he's a fucking legend.

2613
01:50:11.345 --> 01:50:13.639
If my dad was here today,

2614
01:50:13.680 --> 01:50:15.400
I'm sure he would,
you know what I'm saying,


2615
01:50:15.432 --> 01:50:18.352
have a million things to say:
"Do what feels right.


2616
01:50:18.393 --> 01:50:20.938
Don't correct yourself
for whoever you are.


2617
01:50:20.979 --> 01:50:22.689
Just do what feels right to you.

2618
01:50:22.731 --> 01:50:24.316
Do what's natural."

2619
01:51:39.641 --> 01:51:41.894
What's your favorite
Rick James record?


2620
01:51:41.935 --> 01:51:43.520
"You and I."

2621
01:51:46.106 --> 01:51:47.691
Why "You and I"?

2622
01:51:47.733 --> 01:51:50.736
Why is "You and I" your
favorite Rick James record?


2623
01:51:50.777 --> 01:51:53.030
I just like the sound of it,

2624
01:51:53.071 --> 01:51:55.532
the melody, the rhythm.

2625
01:51:55.574 --> 01:51:57.135
- It makes me move.
- It makes you feel good?


2626
01:51:57.159 --> 01:51:59.912
It makes me feel good.-

2627
01:51:59.953 --> 01:52:01.580
What's your favorite
Rick James record?


2628
01:52:01.622 --> 01:52:03.415
Oh, my favorite is.

2629
01:52:03.457 --> 01:52:06.335
- Cold... mm-do-do... Blooded.
- Do it again.


2630
01:52:06.376 --> 01:52:08.212
Do it again.-

2631
01:52:08.253 --> 01:52:10.005
- Do-do-doo.
- Blooded.


2632
01:52:10.047 --> 01:52:11.715
Oh, it's the best.

2633
01:52:11.757 --> 01:52:12.942
- Oh, my God.
- I love that song.


2634
01:52:12.966 --> 01:52:14.760
It just has... oh, my gosh.

2635
01:52:14.801 --> 01:52:19.347
The beat to it. Yeah.
