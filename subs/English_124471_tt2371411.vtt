1
00:03:05.446 --> 00:03:07.281
500 years ago,

2
00:03:07.865 --> 00:03:11.577
a fox demon

3
00:03:12.244 --> 00:03:14.163
saved a mortal man's life,

4
00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.832
which violated the laws
of the demon world.


5
00:03:17.583 --> 00:03:21.378
For this, she was imprisoned
in an icy abyss.


6
00:03:21.462 --> 00:03:25.049
Tortured in extreme coldness
day and night.


7
00:03:48.197 --> 00:03:52.785
A bird demon, attracted by her face,

8
00:03:53.494 --> 00:03:57.581
circled above the abyss daily.

9
00:05:38.515 --> 00:05:42.519
"The Resurrection Painted Skin"

10
00:07:38.427 --> 00:07:39.678
Hurry! Hurry!

11
00:07:53.192 --> 00:07:54.902
I have two pleasures in life.

12
00:07:55.861 --> 00:07:58.113
Taming the wildest horses

13
00:08:02.326 --> 00:08:04.995
and taming the most beautiful women.

14
00:08:08.665 --> 00:08:10.709
I can give you whatever you want.

15
00:08:10.834 --> 00:08:12.461
But what can you offer me?

16
00:08:13.086 --> 00:08:16.298
My pretty one, don't
you know who I am?

17
00:08:17.674 --> 00:08:19.635
Tell me, what is you desire?

18
00:08:19.718 --> 00:08:23.096
You name it. I can give you anything.

19
00:08:26.975 --> 00:08:28.477
I want your heart.

20
00:08:47.579 --> 00:08:49.206
I knew it, miser.

21
00:08:49.331 --> 00:08:50.874
It's pointless to waste time on him.

22
00:08:56.421 --> 00:08:57.381
Sister.

23
00:08:58.298 --> 00:09:00.008
We've trapped so many men.

24
00:09:00.259 --> 00:09:02.344
All of them are liars, aren't they?

25
00:09:03.136 --> 00:09:05.806
Where is the man who
will offer up his heart


26
00:09:05.889 --> 00:09:07.516
to you willingly, my dear sister?

27
00:09:20.821 --> 00:09:22.948
The day of the solar eclipse
is approaching.


28
00:09:25.742 --> 00:09:27.077
Don't worry, sister.

29
00:09:27.828 --> 00:09:30.205
I'll have my whole flock
help you find him!


30
00:09:39.172 --> 00:09:42.342
A month later

31
00:10:00.527 --> 00:10:02.988
Help!

32
00:10:03.572 --> 00:10:06.074
Help!

33
00:11:58.478 --> 00:12:00.480
My name is Xiaowei.

34
00:12:00.564 --> 00:12:02.899
Since a child, I was trained
as a singer and dancer.


35
00:12:03.442 --> 00:12:05.651
I don't know how else to reward you,
general, my savior,


36
00:12:05.652 --> 00:12:08.780
except to follow you
and serve you wherever you go...


37
00:12:22.294 --> 00:12:29.342
Once I departed,
carrying the woe of the willows.


38
00:12:32.012 --> 00:12:35.599
Today I returned

39
00:12:37.559 --> 00:12:40.812
in the midst of the rain and snow.

40
00:12:41.354 --> 00:12:44.357
Those who know me say

41
00:12:45.734 --> 00:12:49.738
Your heart is overflowing with sorrow.

42
00:12:50.989 --> 00:12:54.367
Those who know me not say,

43
00:12:55.285 --> 00:12:58.997
What more do you want?

44
00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:03.710
Those who know me say

45
00:13:04.628 --> 00:13:08.965
Your heart is overflowing with sorrow.

46
00:13:10.133 --> 00:13:13.136
Those who know me not say,

47
00:13:14.304 --> 00:13:18.475
What more do you want?

48
00:13:44.084 --> 00:13:47.045
General, I thought the bandits
had returned.


49
00:13:51.132 --> 00:13:53.218
General, your body is so hot.

50
00:14:10.986 --> 00:14:12.237
I'm scared...

51
00:15:20.096 --> 00:15:22.432
I can't believe a
man could be like that.

52
00:15:23.433 --> 00:15:25.769
He's the first to resist your temptation.

53
00:15:26.519 --> 00:15:27.979
Let's boil a healthy stew

54
00:15:28.438 --> 00:15:29.689
from his heart.

55
00:15:29.814 --> 00:15:31.024
Hold on.

56
00:15:31.274 --> 00:15:32.317
What's wrong?

57
00:15:33.109 --> 00:15:35.528
His body radiates so much heat

58
00:15:35.779 --> 00:15:37.822
it could melt ice.

59
00:15:39.032 --> 00:15:41.242
If he hadn't crossed our path,
I'd be in trouble.


60
00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:43.995
Let's see what's so special about him.

61
00:15:49.167 --> 00:15:50.377
It's a woman!

62
00:15:51.544 --> 00:15:53.046
Sister, what a waste of time again!

63
00:16:08.311 --> 00:16:09.729
Huo Xin...

64
00:16:12.565 --> 00:16:18.196
The border "White City"

65
00:16:39.342 --> 00:16:42.636
Hey! Hey! Hey! 
Don't touch my medicine.

66
00:16:42.637 --> 00:16:44.096
What do you think you're doing?

67
00:16:44.097 --> 00:16:44.973
Fine. Fine. Fine.

68
00:16:44.974 --> 00:16:46.224
I'll tell you a story, alright?

69
00:16:48.309 --> 00:16:49.227
The demons...

70
00:16:50.687 --> 00:16:52.147
They look just like human beings

71
00:16:52.772 --> 00:16:54.399
and they even speak human languages.

72
00:16:55.191 --> 00:16:57.485
You can't tell them apart
when they stand before you.


73
00:16:58.528 --> 00:16:59.446
The demons...

74
00:17:00.405 --> 00:17:02.490
They know how to tempt human hearts.

75
00:17:02.615 --> 00:17:04.325
They know exactly how to control us.

76
00:17:05.118 --> 00:17:06.995
You'd think you're acting under free will.

77
00:17:07.495 --> 00:17:11.791
But actually, you're under their spell.

78
00:17:12.292 --> 00:17:13.418
Then...

79
00:17:16.296 --> 00:17:18.006
They'll dig out your heart and eat it.

80
00:17:23.136 --> 00:17:24.637
Do you know what this is?

81
00:17:24.846 --> 00:17:26.430
This is called a "Demon Capture Bottle".

82
00:17:26.431 --> 00:17:28.683
It illuminates wherever it's near a demon.

83
00:17:30.393 --> 00:17:32.561
Do you know why demons
want to harm people?


84
00:17:32.562 --> 00:17:33.730
No!

85
00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:36.691
Because demons have no hearts.

86
00:17:37.025 --> 00:17:38.610
The demons only have demon spirits.

87
00:17:42.614 --> 00:17:43.822
They must devour hearts

88
00:17:43.823 --> 00:17:45.824
to look like humans...

89
00:17:45.825 --> 00:17:47.911
...and continue to harm human beings.

90
00:17:48.203 --> 00:17:50.622
Then you'll have to come to me

91
00:17:51.873 --> 00:17:52.874
and beg me for my help.

92
00:17:55.168 --> 00:17:56.419
Demon's are coming!

93
00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:03.259
What are you doing?

94
00:18:03.718 --> 00:18:05.553
Come back! Come back!

95
00:18:07.138 --> 00:18:08.890
Come back!

96
00:18:18.024 --> 00:18:19.192
Demon!

97
00:18:21.569 --> 00:18:22.695
There's a demon here.

98
00:18:47.387 --> 00:18:49.304
General Huo, one more time, please!

99
00:18:49.305 --> 00:18:51.850
Yes, Show us what you got General Huo.

100
00:19:36.144 --> 00:19:42.775
Bravo! Bravo!...

101
00:19:43.026 --> 00:19:44.276
What a Skill!

102
00:19:44.277 --> 00:19:46.112
General Huo is a really great archer

103
00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:50.408
General Huo, someone wants to meet you.

104
00:19:50.533 --> 00:19:51.784
Let's change the rules just this once.

105
00:19:52.285 --> 00:19:54.245
Let the man who loses, drink first.

106
00:19:55.622 --> 00:19:57.415
Don't try and fool me.

107
00:19:58.124 --> 00:19:59.876
General Huo, you go first.

108
00:20:16.267 --> 00:20:17.977
Huo Xin. Do you like me?

109
00:20:25.902 --> 00:20:27.779
General Huo. General Huo. General Huo.

110
00:20:28.029 --> 00:20:30.281
What a waste! I should drink it first.

111
00:20:31.783 --> 00:20:34.702
You smell like you've just bathed
in alcohol.


112
00:20:36.412 --> 00:20:37.872
Could you be any more disrespectful?

113
00:20:38.831 --> 00:20:40.166
Remember, each and every one of you!

114
00:20:40.875 --> 00:20:43.336
No staring.

115
00:20:43.461 --> 00:20:46.464
Heads down. Stare at your own feet.

116
00:20:46.589 --> 00:20:48.633
Don't look at her face, understand?

117
00:20:56.474 --> 00:21:00.979
General Huo Xin...
is honored to see you, Your Highness.


118
00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:08.987
It seems the border has become
a paradise for you.


119
00:21:10.822 --> 00:21:13.116
General Huo, you must be having
too much fun here.


120
00:21:15.201 --> 00:21:16.786
I'm sorry, Your Highness.

121
00:21:16.911 --> 00:21:18.663
General Huo, do you remember

122
00:21:19.455 --> 00:21:22.250
when was the last time
we saw each other in the palace?


123
00:21:24.711 --> 00:21:25.670
I'm sorry, I don't remember.

124
00:21:25.670 --> 00:21:26.546
Try harder.

125
00:21:30.675 --> 00:21:33.469
Six...seven...or eight years ago?

126
00:21:33.553 --> 00:21:34.512
Wrong!

127
00:21:35.763 --> 00:21:37.056
I'm a fool.

128
00:21:37.181 --> 00:21:38.266
Pardon me for my poor memory,
Your Highness.


129
00:21:40.143 --> 00:21:41.602
Let's help General Huo sober up.

130
00:22:20.016 --> 00:22:22.060
It's been eight years and seven months.

131
00:22:26.439 --> 00:22:28.775
It's snowing!

132
00:22:46.542 --> 00:22:47.543
Ready the feast!

133
00:22:47.919 --> 00:22:50.129
I wish to reward the men
guarding the border!


134
00:23:03.601 --> 00:23:04.477
Freeze! Who are you?

135
00:23:06.229 --> 00:23:07.230
Who are you?

136
00:23:11.109 --> 00:23:12.276
Dear brothers...

137
00:23:13.778 --> 00:23:15.238
There are demons in the general's home.

138
00:23:17.949 --> 00:23:19.325
You've heard of demons, haven't you?

139
00:23:19.659 --> 00:23:21.119
Your weapons won't work on them.

140
00:23:21.828 --> 00:23:22.578
Look.

141
00:23:22.995 --> 00:23:24.747
This is my "Demon Capture Bottle".

142
00:23:24.956 --> 00:23:26.373
It lights up whenever a demon is near.

143
00:23:26.374 --> 00:23:28.668
There are demons, so it lights up.

144
00:23:29.710 --> 00:23:30.461
See?

145
00:23:31.796 --> 00:23:34.382
Let me in. I
need to see General Huo.

146
00:23:41.139 --> 00:23:43.558
What are you doing? 
How dare you...

147
00:23:44.392 --> 00:23:45.393
Get out!

148
00:24:00.616 --> 00:24:01.617
General Huo!

149
00:24:03.077 --> 00:24:06.205
No formality is needed at this feast.

150
00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:10.084
Come on. Cheers.

151
00:24:11.961 --> 00:24:13.754
I've been stationed at the border
for too long


152
00:24:13.838 --> 00:24:15.173
and I've neglected my duty for too long.

153
00:24:15.339 --> 00:24:16.924
Thanks to the criticism
from Your Highness,


154
00:24:17.049 --> 00:24:18.384
I'm determined to stop drinking for good.

155
00:26:11.622 --> 00:26:12.665
How dare you?

156
00:26:25.303 --> 00:26:27.221
If you dare to get
close to Huo Xin again,

157
00:26:28.389 --> 00:26:29.724
I'll kill you.

158
00:26:30.683 --> 00:26:32.476
Xiaowei is just an entertainer.

159
00:26:33.352 --> 00:26:34.895
Please have mercy, 
Your Highness.

160
00:26:37.189 --> 00:26:39.108
General Huo is waiting at the door.

161
00:26:39.567 --> 00:26:41.444
He's been standing there
for one day and one night.


162
00:26:42.069 --> 00:26:43.237
Will Your Highness see him now?

163
00:28:08.114 --> 00:28:10.615
Miss, tell me, where are you going?

164
00:28:10.616 --> 00:28:11.409
Let me take you there.

165
00:28:11.575 --> 00:28:12.992
Move out of my way.

166
00:28:12.993 --> 00:28:14.745
I'm seeing a relative nearby.

167
00:28:15.663 --> 00:28:18.416
Miss. Come with me, please.

168
00:28:18.582 --> 00:28:21.252
I'll take you there, alright?

169
00:28:21.377 --> 00:28:24.422
We'll find him for you,
no matter how long it takes.


170
00:28:25.256 --> 00:28:26.507
Alright?

171
00:28:33.639 --> 00:28:37.017
Judging from the tone of the skin
on your forehead,


172
00:28:37.184 --> 00:28:38.560
I can tell that
your liver has a fever!

173
00:28:38.561 --> 00:28:40.604
I have a secret ancestral remedy.

174
00:28:40.688 --> 00:28:42.105
I promise it can cure you immediately!

175
00:28:42.106 --> 00:28:43.482
Would you like a double dose?

176
00:28:44.442 --> 00:28:45.109
Miss, go.

177
00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:46.110
Get lost with your fake medicine!

178
00:28:46.111 --> 00:28:47.403
How dare you ruin my business?

179
00:28:58.664 --> 00:28:59.956
Don't you dare hit me.

180
00:28:59.957 --> 00:29:01.917
General Huo is my sworn brother, truly!

181
00:29:02.293 --> 00:29:04.378
General Huo's father is my stableboy,
truly!


182
00:29:04.503 --> 00:29:05.629
What a loser!

183
00:29:06.881 --> 00:29:08.048
Miss.

184
00:29:09.508 --> 00:29:11.135
Come with me.

185
00:29:20.311 --> 00:29:24.523
Demon...demon...

186
00:29:25.608 --> 00:29:27.943
Demon...demon...

187
00:29:32.198 --> 00:29:33.699
Shut up, will you?

188
00:29:34.241 --> 00:29:36.035
Aren't you a demon hunter?

189
00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:37.828
Never seen a real demon before?

190
00:29:39.121 --> 00:29:41.040
Which species...of demons are you?

191
00:30:25.626 --> 00:30:26.377
Huo Xin.

192
00:30:26.961 --> 00:30:29.463
This is your dagger from your time
as a royal palace guard.


193
00:30:30.714 --> 00:30:32.091
Do you remember?

194
00:30:35.886 --> 00:30:38.472
I thought I lost it
in the stomach of the black bear.


195
00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:43.561
After you left the capital,

196
00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:46.272
whenever it snowed,

197
00:30:46.939 --> 00:30:48.941
I had one more
gem embedded in its handle.

198
00:30:50.609 --> 00:30:51.986
The goldsmith said,

199
00:30:52.903 --> 00:30:55.906
there is only room for one more.

200
00:30:57.157 --> 00:30:58.826
Huo Xin. Hurry!

201
00:31:08.669 --> 00:31:11.005
It's snowing!

202
00:31:14.091 --> 00:31:15.384
Huo Xin.

203
00:31:16.218 --> 00:31:17.845
Do you like me?

204
00:31:22.266 --> 00:31:23.684
Do you?

205
00:31:27.396 --> 00:31:30.774
Why didn't you answer me back then?

206
00:31:31.191 --> 00:31:32.735
I was just one of your guards.

207
00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:35.029
I had no right.

208
00:31:36.989 --> 00:31:39.199
Your Highness, it's dangerous over there!

209
00:31:39.325 --> 00:31:40.784
Leave me alone!

210
00:31:41.702 --> 00:31:45.497
Huo Xin, look at me.

211
00:31:49.627 --> 00:31:51.128
Now tell me.

212
00:31:52.963 --> 00:31:54.256
Do you like me?

213
00:31:58.093 --> 00:31:59.470
I had dreamed of

214
00:32:02.848 --> 00:32:05.100
protecting Your Highness all my life.

215
00:32:20.199 --> 00:32:22.743
Nobody has seen the other half
of my face before.


216
00:32:25.162 --> 00:32:26.830
But I don't mind you looking upon it.

217
00:32:28.415 --> 00:32:30.000
Now I give you my permission

218
00:32:31.377 --> 00:32:33.045
to remove the mask.

219
00:34:01.175 --> 00:34:03.343
White City is near the warmongering

220
00:34:04.261 --> 00:34:05.596
Tian Lang State.

221
00:34:05.763 --> 00:34:07.181
Your Highness, you'd better
leave here soon.


222
00:34:07.931 --> 00:34:09.266
I will go,

223
00:34:09.892 --> 00:34:11.810
but not without you by my side.

224
00:34:13.312 --> 00:34:15.272
We'll run away together,

225
00:34:15.731 --> 00:34:18.901
anywhere. Just you and me.

226
00:34:22.446 --> 00:34:24.156
Your Highness, please don't joke.

227
00:34:26.492 --> 00:34:28.327
I have responsibilities at this post.

228
00:34:30.621 --> 00:34:32.539
You and I belong to different worlds.

229
00:34:32.623 --> 00:34:34.458
I mustn't repeat my mistake.

230
00:34:40.214 --> 00:34:41.673
Don't force me to leave.

231
00:34:47.054 --> 00:34:48.680
Your Highness, please forget me.

232
00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:06.884
Royal court of the Tian Lang state

233
00:36:07.968 --> 00:36:11.263
Spirits of my ancestors,

234
00:36:11.513 --> 00:36:15.058
please grant me the power.

235
00:36:19.021 --> 00:36:21.982
From the Divine Kingdom,

236
00:36:22.941 --> 00:36:25.819
please answer my prayer.

237
00:36:27.154 --> 00:36:30.574
Spirits of my ancestors,

238
00:36:32.075 --> 00:36:35.287
please grant me the power.

239
00:36:38.999 --> 00:36:43.128
The masked woman is in the White City.

240
00:36:47.591 --> 00:36:51.345
The Han Chinese broke their promises.

241
00:36:55.599 --> 00:36:57.643
In seven days time,

242
00:36:57.726 --> 00:37:04.191
The Tian Lang God will swallow the sun.

243
00:37:04.316 --> 00:37:08.779
That is the only change for our prince
to return to your side.


244
00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:15.202
Great God of Tian Lang,

245
00:37:15.494 --> 00:37:19.206
my Azhuna can wait no more!

246
00:37:19.456 --> 00:37:21.708
My lord,

247
00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.378
this isn't the time to shed tears.

248
00:37:24.586 --> 00:37:27.213
Call the chiefs to wage war

249
00:37:27.214 --> 00:37:29.132
on White City!

250
00:37:29.716 --> 00:37:33.011
We'll get her here, one way or another.

251
00:37:36.223 --> 00:37:42.062
Go. Go and taste the freedom
I never enjoyed.


252
00:39:43.517 --> 00:39:46.770
The bug tastes delicious. 
Don't waste it.

253
00:40:04.037 --> 00:40:05.831
This...how come it stopped
glowing...why?


254
00:40:06.123 --> 00:40:09.084
I just gave you a good meal.
Are you still trying to frame me?


255
00:40:09.376 --> 00:40:11.711
No. No. No. It's not like that.

256
00:40:12.212 --> 00:40:15.006
I'm just curious about your species...

257
00:40:15.382 --> 00:40:16.925
and what made my bottle stop working?

258
00:40:17.968 --> 00:40:20.011
You're a fake demon hunter!

259
00:40:20.387 --> 00:40:21.847
You don't want to know me at all!

260
00:40:22.597 --> 00:40:24.182
I am truly a demon hunter!

261
00:40:24.307 --> 00:40:25.933
I'm the thirteenth generation,

262
00:40:25.934 --> 00:40:27.644
it's the truth!

263
00:40:27.769 --> 00:40:28.937
Miss, if you don't believe me...

264
00:40:30.313 --> 00:40:31.648
this Almanac of Demons is the proof.

265
00:40:37.404 --> 00:40:39.364
What the hell is this?

266
00:40:40.824 --> 00:40:42.409
Haven't you heard of the Almanac
of Demons?


267
00:40:42.993 --> 00:40:44.369
It's from my ancestors.

268
00:40:44.494 --> 00:40:46.663
All demons, big or small,

269
00:40:46.788 --> 00:40:48.832
are listed inside

270
00:40:49.708 --> 00:40:51.001
Look for me then.

271
00:40:52.586 --> 00:40:54.129
I'm curious what it says.

272
00:40:59.509 --> 00:41:04.222
Forms. Weapons. Fish. Bugs. Beasts.

273
00:41:07.058 --> 00:41:07.934
Birds.

274
00:41:11.313 --> 00:41:13.315
Manman Bird. Five
-Colored Bird.

275
00:41:14.566 --> 00:41:17.903
Nine
-Headed Bird. Dragon
-Headed Bird.

276
00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:25.827
Corpse
-Eating Eagle, Luan,

277
00:41:25.952 --> 00:41:29.164
Jingwei, Phoenix.

278
00:41:36.171 --> 00:41:38.465
You're not listed.

279
00:41:42.093 --> 00:41:43.220
Then you're probably not a demon.

280
00:41:47.349 --> 00:41:48.808
What do you mean I'm not a demon?

281
00:41:52.771 --> 00:41:54.064
What do you mean I'm not a demon?

282
00:41:54.189 --> 00:41:56.482
You are...no, you're not a demon

283
00:41:56.483 --> 00:41:58.484
Perhaps you're too insignificant

284
00:41:58.485 --> 00:41:59.861
to be mentioned.

285
00:42:00.278 --> 00:42:03.406
Perhaps you're a new species
or just an amateur.


286
00:42:03.490 --> 00:42:04.366
You!

287
00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:18.630
What are you doing to me?

288
00:42:20.131 --> 00:42:23.176
You have no qualifications
to be included!


289
00:42:56.543 --> 00:42:58.336
You can't kill me.

290
00:43:02.340 --> 00:43:03.550
You're not human.

291
00:43:04.634 --> 00:43:08.555
You're right. I am a demon.

292
00:43:10.181 --> 00:43:11.391
Why did you save me?

293
00:43:12.934 --> 00:43:15.145
Because you in turn can save me.

294
00:43:15.854 --> 00:43:18.189
I violated demon law

295
00:43:19.357 --> 00:43:22.110
and have been frozen
in ice for 500 years.

296
00:43:22.527 --> 00:43:24.362
I escaped,

297
00:43:25.405 --> 00:43:27.907
but I may be
captured again at any time.

298
00:43:28.908 --> 00:43:30.201
What does this have to do with me?

299
00:43:30.869 --> 00:43:35.790
Your heart is different from others.
Hot enough to melt ice.


300
00:43:59.356 --> 00:44:03.860
General Huo, I think you're
under the spell of a demon.


301
00:44:11.451 --> 00:44:13.286
Get out of here with your witchcraft.

302
00:44:13.787 --> 00:44:15.789
Aren't you the fake medicine seller
in the market?


303
00:44:18.124 --> 00:44:19.166
I've kept the broken
tail of a fox demon

304
00:44:19.167 --> 00:44:20.919
in my bottle.

305
00:44:21.044 --> 00:44:22.337
It is from my ancestors

306
00:44:22.587 --> 00:44:25.173
Whenever a demon passes by,
the bottle will glow.


307
00:44:25.590 --> 00:44:28.009
General Huo,

308
00:44:28.301 --> 00:44:30.887
do you have any guests in your home?

309
00:44:33.014 --> 00:44:35.433
The fox demons will cause you trouble,
even kill you.


310
00:44:35.850 --> 00:44:37.643
I saw her entering your gate
with my own eyes.


311
00:44:37.644 --> 00:44:39.437
She was on a
large horse, wearing a mask.

312
00:44:39.562 --> 00:44:41.064
When she passed by, the bottle began to...

313
00:44:44.234 --> 00:44:45.902
That was Princess Jing.

314
00:44:46.528 --> 00:44:47.946
Stop talking nonsense.

315
00:44:49.656 --> 00:44:50.865
Princess Jing

316
00:44:52.909 --> 00:44:54.619
What is Princess Jing doing
in the White City?


317
00:44:57.080 --> 00:44:59.374
Since you love Huo Xin so much,

318
00:44:59.999 --> 00:45:02.669
you should know for sure.

319
00:45:03.336 --> 00:45:05.296
Your Highness, have you thought
why you've been separated?


320
00:45:05.755 --> 00:45:08.425
Is he in love

321
00:45:10.009 --> 00:45:11.970
with another woman?

322
00:45:13.930 --> 00:45:15.640
Forgive my directness,

323
00:45:15.765 --> 00:45:19.602
but what men care about most
is a woman's beauty.


324
00:45:22.439 --> 00:45:23.648
I don't believe it.

325
00:45:25.191 --> 00:45:26.860
Huo Xin is not like that.

326
00:45:27.110 --> 00:45:28.486
Then why did he reject you.

327
00:45:32.073 --> 00:45:35.243
General Huo is a man too.
Men only see a woman's beauty.


328
00:45:35.702 --> 00:45:36.995
He said...

329
00:45:39.289 --> 00:45:41.332
He said he remembered how I once looked.

330
00:45:42.459 --> 00:45:45.003
But you no longer look like before.

331
00:46:11.154 --> 00:46:13.907
So you're a demon?

332
00:46:21.623 --> 00:46:23.416
And you can do sorcery?

333
00:46:23.958 --> 00:46:24.876
Yes.

334
00:46:25.376 --> 00:46:28.004
Can you transform me to my old self?

335
00:46:29.047 --> 00:46:31.674
Demons can paint their own faces
however they like.


336
00:46:32.967 --> 00:46:34.511
But you're only human.

337
00:46:35.595 --> 00:46:36.846
You can't paint your own face.

338
00:46:39.766 --> 00:46:42.060
But I do have a way.

339
00:46:44.062 --> 00:46:45.688
What is that?

340
00:47:01.955 --> 00:47:04.290
I am a princess of this empire.

341
00:47:06.459 --> 00:47:08.335
How humiliating to steal a man's heart

342
00:47:08.336 --> 00:47:10.296
with borrowed beauty?

343
00:47:10.421 --> 00:47:11.673
Try it once.

344
00:47:12.757 --> 00:47:17.554
You'll see how he behaves
if you look exactly like me.


345
00:47:34.779 --> 00:47:36.573
This is ridiculous!

346
00:48:13.026 --> 00:48:18.656
Come on. Drink it.
It will feel just like a dream.


347
00:48:19.449 --> 00:48:22.660
It's just like wearing new clothes
in a dream.


348
00:50:12.270 --> 00:50:13.438
No!

349
00:50:15.732 --> 00:50:18.526
I don't want to hurt you.

350
00:50:21.821 --> 00:50:24.949
From this moment on,

351
00:50:28.202 --> 00:50:32.373
you are the most beautiful woman
in the world.


352
00:50:37.503 --> 00:50:43.760
No man will be
able to resist your charm.

353
00:50:51.559 --> 00:50:53.686
To have you,

354
00:50:55.354 --> 00:51:02.445
they'll be willing to do
or say anything...


355
00:53:35.181 --> 00:53:39.185
You must return here within 12 hours

356
00:53:39.727 --> 00:53:41.312
to wear your own skin,

357
00:53:42.146 --> 00:53:46.567
or it will flake into a thousand pieces...

358
00:53:50.112 --> 00:53:51.155
Huo Xin.

359
00:53:54.200 --> 00:53:55.910
Now I give you the permission

360
00:53:57.328 --> 00:53:58.621
to take off my mask.

361
00:54:29.568 --> 00:54:32.655
General Huo, Xiaowei has a few questions.

362
00:54:34.198 --> 00:54:35.741
General, as you know,

363
00:54:36.117 --> 00:54:38.494
his Majesty has 14 daughters,

364
00:54:38.869 --> 00:54:40.496
but why is one

365
00:54:40.955 --> 00:54:44.041
still unattached?

366
00:54:46.085 --> 00:54:47.628
No man in the world

367
00:54:49.005 --> 00:54:50.756
is worthy of Princess Jing.

368
00:54:57.596 --> 00:55:00.558
Or perhaps she has a lover
in her heart already.


369
00:55:01.809 --> 00:55:04.228
Perhaps she wants to spend
the rest of her life with him.


370
00:55:05.146 --> 00:55:07.064
Despite his status.

371
00:55:09.525 --> 00:55:13.529
Her Highness said you saved her life
eight years ago.


372
00:55:15.448 --> 00:55:17.533
If not for you,
she would be dead a long time ago.


373
00:55:18.909 --> 00:55:20.286
I was only fulfilling my duty.

374
00:55:20.369 --> 00:55:21.579
Your duty?

375
00:55:23.539 --> 00:55:26.751
After her disfigurement,
you left without saying goodbye.


376
00:55:34.091 --> 00:55:36.302
General, you can be honest with me.

377
00:55:38.304 --> 00:55:40.598
Is it because you loathed
her disfigured face?


378
00:55:40.723 --> 00:55:41.474
No.

379
00:55:41.640 --> 00:55:43.809
Or that you never really liked her?

380
00:55:51.484 --> 00:55:52.943
Miss, please leave me alone.

381
00:55:54.278 --> 00:55:58.199
I'm responsible to guard the border.
Death comes in the blink of an eye.


382
00:55:59.992 --> 00:56:03.746
I have no time for romance.

383
00:56:06.332 --> 00:56:08.501
General, are you in love
with somebody else?


384
00:56:16.258 --> 00:56:17.843
If you say so.

385
00:56:20.638 --> 00:56:21.680
Finally the truth.

386
00:56:23.891 --> 00:56:24.975
Who is she?

387
00:57:17.111 --> 00:57:18.696
Why are you carrying
the dagger of Her Highness?


388
00:57:23.409 --> 00:57:24.952
She ordered me to kill you.

389
00:57:32.793 --> 00:57:36.547
The hold it just like Her Highness.

390
00:57:58.235 --> 00:58:02.698
Smell it...the fragrance of azaleas
in the breeze.


391
00:59:05.511 --> 00:59:08.514
It takes a sparrow 570 years
to become a spirit,


392
00:59:08.639 --> 00:59:12.142
a snake 820 years,

393
00:59:12.268 --> 00:59:15.646
and a fox 1000 years

394
00:59:16.355 --> 00:59:17.356
Don't move!

395
00:59:19.984 --> 00:59:23.529
A fox demon is the closest

396
00:59:23.612 --> 00:59:25.906
to human in nature.

397
00:59:27.825 --> 00:59:28.993
Can you introduce me

398
00:59:29.201 --> 00:59:31.704
to the fox demon?

399
00:59:35.708 --> 00:59:37.293
What do you want to meet her for?

400
00:59:38.335 --> 00:59:43.465
I...actually...had never
before met a real demon.


401
00:59:43.757 --> 00:59:46.051
Only heard stories from my forefathers.

402
00:59:46.135 --> 00:59:49.054
So...I...

403
00:59:50.556 --> 00:59:51.682
What on earth do you want?

404
00:59:54.143 --> 00:59:55.519
I want to become a demon.

405
00:59:57.146 --> 00:59:58.731
What a crazy world we are living in!

406
00:59:58.856 --> 01:00:01.025
The demons want to be humans,
and the humans want to be demons!


407
01:00:01.317 --> 01:00:02.900
It must be wonderful to be a demon!

408
01:00:02.901 --> 01:00:05.404
See, they're immortal...

409
01:00:05.529 --> 01:00:07.740
...and can do whatever they want!

410
01:00:08.032 --> 01:00:12.745
Is it true that demons can become human?

411
01:00:13.954 --> 01:00:15.080
Let me check.

412
01:00:16.165 --> 01:00:20.544
Forms...Spiritual Cultivation...Magic.

413
01:00:22.254 --> 01:00:24.548
Here we go. Look. Life
-Transforming Magic.

414
01:00:25.716 --> 01:00:27.718
A solar eclipse obscures the line

415
01:00:27.801 --> 01:00:31.304
between day and night
so it is the only time


416
01:00:31.305 --> 01:00:35.225
humans and demons can change places.

417
01:00:37.102 --> 01:00:39.313
But a demon must have a heart

418
01:00:39.813 --> 01:00:46.111
offered freely to them.

419
01:00:50.574 --> 01:00:52.409
Then the demon can...transform
into a human.


420
01:00:52.701 --> 01:00:55.621
See. It's written right here.

421
01:00:56.413 --> 01:01:00.042
Who would be be stupid enough
to give up his heart?


422
01:01:00.125 --> 01:01:01.710
Are you? I...

423
01:01:02.127 --> 01:01:03.462
It's just myth.

424
01:01:04.046 --> 01:01:06.215
There's no record of a successful attempt.

425
01:01:09.259 --> 01:01:11.178
By the eclipse,

426
01:01:11.595 --> 01:01:15.766
if Xiaowei isn't human, she'll die!

427
01:01:17.768 --> 01:01:20.854
Why would a fox demon
want to become human?


428
01:01:26.652 --> 01:01:28.404
I was right, wasn't I?

429
01:01:29.530 --> 01:01:32.574
Men only care about beauty.

430
01:01:33.659 --> 01:01:35.411
Even Huo Xin.

431
01:01:36.829 --> 01:01:38.122
I hate your body.

432
01:01:40.958 --> 01:01:42.876
But Huo Xin is desirous of it.

433
01:02:06.608 --> 01:02:10.571
If you destroy it,
you'll never be close to him again.


434
01:02:14.950 --> 01:02:17.494
You may have my body forever.

435
01:02:18.871 --> 01:02:22.624
But there is a price to pay.

436
01:02:23.083 --> 01:02:25.252
It's only a small price.

437
01:02:25.586 --> 01:02:26.920
What on earth do you want?

438
01:02:27.838 --> 01:02:29.715
I can give my body to you.

439
01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:30.507
Why?

440
01:02:31.008 --> 01:02:34.720
My body is getting colder and colder...

441
01:02:36.054 --> 01:02:37.431
But I want to...

442
01:02:39.475 --> 01:02:41.643
...borrow your heart for a while...

443
01:02:41.810 --> 01:02:42.644
No!

444
01:02:43.353 --> 01:02:45.022
You traveled thousands of miles

445
01:02:45.272 --> 01:02:47.316
to be with him, right?

446
01:02:49.359 --> 01:02:52.821
Your Highness, Huo Xin needs
to speak with you.


447
01:02:53.572 --> 01:02:59.912
Remember, it was I who spent the night
with him.


448
01:03:03.499 --> 01:03:05.083
General Huo, come in please.

449
01:03:19.431 --> 01:03:23.560
Your Highness, please take your dagger
and leave here.


450
01:03:32.611 --> 01:03:34.488
Who did you spend the night
with last night?


451
01:03:38.283 --> 01:03:39.993
I order you to answer me.

452
01:03:41.745 --> 01:03:42.955
With a woman.

453
01:03:44.665 --> 01:03:45.415
To do what?

454
01:03:52.881 --> 01:03:54.258
She is a demon!

455
01:03:55.551 --> 01:03:56.635
Kill her!

456
01:04:00.097 --> 01:04:01.723
I order you to kill her!

457
01:04:04.685 --> 01:04:06.311
You'll see how she really looks!

458
01:04:14.945 --> 01:04:16.363
You can't do that.

459
01:04:17.489 --> 01:04:18.782
Then I'll kill her for you!

460
01:04:21.368 --> 01:04:22.494
Get out of my way!

461
01:05:08.165 --> 01:05:12.127
You're so blinded,
you can't tell human from demon!


462
01:05:28.894 --> 01:05:30.562
Your Highness...

463
01:05:31.897 --> 01:05:33.482
Sir Jian Ling is here!

464
01:05:49.706 --> 01:05:53.669
I'm here at your service.
Pardon me for being so late!


465
01:06:08.058 --> 01:06:11.186
In the beginning of time,
to tame all demons


466
01:06:11.978 --> 01:06:14.106
Fuxi created human beings
with his own blood.


467
01:06:14.356 --> 01:06:16.483
The first man he created
was a demon hunter.


468
01:06:17.359 --> 01:06:20.570
I think you and your almanac
are both fake.


469
01:06:22.114 --> 01:06:25.784
You don't know how to capture demons.
You're just a con artist.


470
01:06:25.951 --> 01:06:28.786
The very blood of a demon hunter
can kill demons.


471
01:06:28.787 --> 01:06:29.705
This bloodline has never been broken.

472
01:06:30.080 --> 01:06:31.790
My medicine might be average,

473
01:06:32.082 --> 01:06:34.000
but my blood is real.

474
01:06:34.668 --> 01:06:36.503
Then let me try your blood.

475
01:07:03.113 --> 01:07:04.322
You're a total coward.

476
01:07:05.282 --> 01:07:07.033
It's just a spot of blood.

477
01:07:07.993 --> 01:07:09.202
It won't kill you.

478
01:07:30.390 --> 01:07:32.601
What's wrong, Quer?

479
01:07:33.018 --> 01:07:36.229
Ah...finally I can feel pain.

480
01:07:37.105 --> 01:07:38.565
Xiaowei said to...

481
01:07:40.859 --> 01:07:43.779
...feel love is to experience pain.

482
01:07:48.825 --> 01:07:54.956
After insistent proposals

483
01:07:55.165 --> 01:07:58.835
from the State of Tian Lang,

484
01:07:59.711 --> 01:08:02.214
By lmperial Edict,

485
01:08:02.798 --> 01:08:07.636
the Chinese Empire approves the marriage

486
01:08:08.303 --> 01:08:11.765
between Princess Jing

487
01:08:12.974 --> 01:08:17.687
and Prince Tian Lang

488
01:08:17.854 --> 01:08:19.689
and our kingdoms.

489
01:08:20.482 --> 01:08:26.238
Every man is responsible

490
01:08:26.738 --> 01:08:30.283
for Princess Jing's protection.

491
01:08:34.079 --> 01:08:38.040
You were due to arrive
at the State of Tian Lang


492
01:08:38.041 --> 01:08:39.751
five days ago.

493
01:08:40.627 --> 01:08:43.880
Your disappearance caused chaos

494
01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:47.509
at the royal palace.

495
01:08:49.010 --> 01:08:51.805
Any more delay...

496
01:08:52.347 --> 01:08:58.019
...will be taken as a declaration of war.

497
01:09:03.859 --> 01:09:04.985
I'm not going.

498
01:09:08.071 --> 01:09:11.616
Your Highness, please bear in mind

499
01:09:11.825 --> 01:09:14.536
the interest of the empire.

500
01:09:15.662 --> 01:09:16.955
I'm not going through with the marriage.

501
01:09:24.754 --> 01:09:26.423
I am already Huo Xin's woman.

502
01:09:35.473 --> 01:09:37.809
You? How dare you...

503
01:09:39.477 --> 01:09:42.522
Guards! Arrest this man for treason.

504
01:09:43.273 --> 01:09:44.649
Behead him!

505
01:09:46.735 --> 01:09:50.530
No! Don't touch him!
Nobody may touch General Huo!


506
01:09:50.697 --> 01:09:52.532
Are you rebelling against His Majesty?

507
01:10:05.795 --> 01:10:09.341
Pardon me, Your Highness...

508
01:10:11.092 --> 01:10:12.177
Emergency!

509
01:10:12.719 --> 01:10:16.306
General, the army of the Tian Lang
are 15 miles away!


510
01:10:47.754 --> 01:10:48.713
Sister, look!

511
01:10:48.714 --> 01:10:50.215
I know the real feeling of pain now!

512
01:10:50.715 --> 01:10:52.342
Only humans can know pain and suffering!

513
01:10:53.843 --> 01:10:55.470
I mean it, I
really know how it feels.

514
01:10:55.553 --> 01:10:56.930
It's just a small burn.

515
01:10:57.263 --> 01:10:58.556
Don't pretend to know anything.

516
01:10:59.641 --> 01:11:00.517
I know it for sure!

517
01:11:03.979 --> 01:11:07.774
Do you have a human temperature
and heartbeat?


518
01:11:08.191 --> 01:11:09.818
Can you smell flowers?

519
01:11:10.318 --> 01:11:13.655
Can you tell the color of the sky?
Have you shed tears?


520
01:11:13.822 --> 01:11:16.366
Is there anybody in the world
prepared to die for you?


521
01:11:19.911 --> 01:11:20.745
Is there?

522
01:11:29.879 --> 01:11:34.300
She was once hurt because of me.

523
01:11:34.884 --> 01:11:36.761
I won't let it happen again.

524
01:12:04.330 --> 01:12:12.172
Ancestors of the Wolf tribes,
descend upon us.


525
01:12:15.925 --> 01:12:20.638
Help our brave warriors conquer everything
in their path.


526
01:12:21.222 --> 01:12:25.393
All under heaven will surrender to us!

527
01:12:25.477 --> 01:12:33.477
Victory! Victory!

528
01:13:04.766 --> 01:13:09.729
Your Emperor has commanded Princess Jing
to marry our prince.


529
01:13:11.064 --> 01:13:12.857
We're here to take our bride home.

530
01:13:14.901 --> 01:13:20.198
Her Highness needs to rest
after her journey.


531
01:13:20.949 --> 01:13:22.574
Please be patient.

532
01:13:22.575 --> 01:13:25.078
We have no more patience.

533
01:13:27.330 --> 01:13:29.124
Our 100,000 warriors

534
01:13:29.916 --> 01:13:33.503
will trample White City.

535
01:13:33.586 --> 01:13:35.421
Where are your so called "warriors"?

536
01:13:35.588 --> 01:13:37.257
You outnumber us, that's all.

537
01:13:40.718 --> 01:13:42.554
Has the motherly love of your queen

538
01:13:44.013 --> 01:13:46.349
turned you to cowards?

539
01:13:48.810 --> 01:13:53.189
How are we going to fight?
One on one, or one on 100,000?


540
01:14:07.245 --> 01:14:12.041
General Huo is fighting outside...

541
01:14:12.292 --> 01:14:14.544
...to give you some time

542
01:14:14.627 --> 01:14:17.504
He asked me to escort
you out of the city

543
01:14:17.505 --> 01:14:21.009
through a secret passage.

544
01:14:21.134 --> 01:14:25.221
Your Highness, please don't break
the marriage commitment.


545
01:14:25.471 --> 01:14:27.473
Let's go out of
the city to make peace

546
01:14:27.807 --> 01:14:30.602
before it's too late.

547
01:15:13.519 --> 01:15:15.480
Who else is ready to fight?

548
01:15:16.522 --> 01:15:21.736
This brave warrior reminds me
of my Azhuna.


549
01:15:22.028 --> 01:15:27.617
We can't beat him
without using our wolf slaves.


550
01:15:28.201 --> 01:15:32.664
My lord, let them tear him apart.

551
01:17:57.058 --> 01:17:59.017
Bao! Go back and guard the city!

552
01:17:59.018 --> 01:18:00.560
The Tian Lang are breaking
the rules of war.


553
01:18:00.561 --> 01:18:02.480
Let me help you, General Huo.

554
01:19:11.382 --> 01:19:15.136
Open the city gates and
give us Princess Jing.


555
01:19:16.137 --> 01:19:18.764
And my lord may consider
having mercy on you.


556
01:19:31.277 --> 01:19:32.570
Here I am.

557
01:19:42.413 --> 01:19:43.706
Let Huo Xin go.

558
01:19:44.957 --> 01:19:46.375
Retreat from the city,

559
01:19:49.003 --> 01:19:51.881
and in three days I will
marry your prince.


560
01:19:53.758 --> 01:19:56.177
You've betrayed your marriage vows once.

561
01:19:57.845 --> 01:20:00.306
How can we trust you to keep
your commitment?


562
01:20:04.727 --> 01:20:05.853
If you don't retreat now,

563
01:20:06.979 --> 01:20:10.942
you'll get nothing but a corpse.

564
01:20:24.413 --> 01:20:25.998
Within three days,

565
01:20:26.791 --> 01:20:29.502
if you haven't bowed down before me,

566
01:20:32.088 --> 01:20:37.009
I will come back and kill everyone!

567
01:21:20.678 --> 01:21:27.560
The heavens and the earth are eternal,

568
01:21:30.354 --> 01:21:38.354
but my heart is full of sorrow.

569
01:21:38.738 --> 01:21:45.578
If there is a sweet hereafter,

570
01:21:47.913 --> 01:21:55.913
it will be another endless torture.

571
01:22:01.052 --> 01:22:03.763
Those who know me say

572
01:22:05.056 --> 01:22:07.767
Your heart is filled with sorrow

573
01:22:10.895 --> 01:22:15.816
Those who know me not say, What...

574
01:22:45.262 --> 01:22:46.597
Save me...

575
01:23:02.279 --> 01:23:04.281
I loved a man once.

576
01:23:06.367 --> 01:23:09.078
I only ever wanted to be with him.

577
01:23:11.288 --> 01:23:13.082
He said he loved me.

578
01:23:14.667 --> 01:23:16.127
And I believed him.

579
01:23:19.171 --> 01:23:22.258
Then he told me he couldn't
abandon his wife.


580
01:23:27.680 --> 01:23:31.934
I saved their human lives
with all my magic.


581
01:23:33.269 --> 01:23:37.648
That's why I was sentenced
to 500 years imprisonment.


582
01:23:48.033 --> 01:23:49.952
I'm so envious of you.

583
01:23:51.203 --> 01:23:54.206
He loves you so much
that he's willing to die for you.


584
01:23:55.082 --> 01:23:57.376
How can you leave a man like that?

585
01:24:03.716 --> 01:24:05.426
I am a princess.

586
01:24:07.261 --> 01:24:08.804
I have no other choice.

587
01:24:10.097 --> 01:24:11.390
Yes, you have.

588
01:24:11.766 --> 01:24:14.560
You can transform into me
and be with him forever.


589
01:24:20.191 --> 01:24:21.984
At the cost of my heart, my soul?

590
01:24:22.067 --> 01:24:23.027
Yes.

591
01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:27.823
You'll trade your heart for my flesh.

592
01:24:41.253 --> 01:24:46.008
You kill humans as easily
as killing an insect.


593
01:24:47.927 --> 01:24:50.304
Wouldn't it have been easier
to just tear our my heart?


594
01:24:51.847 --> 01:24:53.891
Why did you bother
to plot this elaborate scheme?


595
01:24:54.642 --> 01:24:56.477
Why waste so much time on me?

596
01:24:57.228 --> 01:25:02.608
By force, all I get is a dead heart
full of fear.


597
01:25:04.193 --> 01:25:05.486
It will be of no use to me.

598
01:25:10.074 --> 01:25:15.621
I want the heart you
offer willingly to me.


599
01:25:16.580 --> 01:25:21.210
That is the only way for me
to become human.


600
01:25:30.052 --> 01:25:31.262
If you make a trade with me,

601
01:25:32.596 --> 01:25:35.140
I'll fulfill the marriage duties.

602
01:25:35.266 --> 01:25:37.017
If you journey to the Tian Lang State,

603
01:25:38.853 --> 01:25:40.229
you'll suffer so much,
you'll wish you were dead.


604
01:25:40.354 --> 01:25:43.274
At least I will know how it feels
to be human.


605
01:25:48.696 --> 01:25:50.781
I had thought the demon life
was free of worries.


606
01:25:53.117 --> 01:25:54.785
It seems that it's the same
as that of a human.


607
01:26:14.722 --> 01:26:18.392
What will happen if I have no heart?

608
01:26:24.523 --> 01:26:26.567
To maintain the health of this body,

609
01:26:27.735 --> 01:26:32.698
you must devour human hearts,
just like a wandering ghost.


610
01:26:34.783 --> 01:26:36.452
Nobody will know your real identity.

611
01:26:38.662 --> 01:26:41.248
It will be a secret forever.

612
01:26:42.541 --> 01:26:44.960
But I'll be able to spend
the rest of my life with Huo Xin.


613
01:26:50.090 --> 01:26:51.467
That's good enough.

614
01:26:53.010 --> 01:26:55.346
Without a heart, you will become a demon.

615
01:26:57.348 --> 01:27:01.352
You might be thrown back into the icy
abyss to endure endless torture.


616
01:27:02.853 --> 01:27:03.979
I understand.

617
01:27:08.692 --> 01:27:10.486
I am willing to take the risk.

618
01:30:07.329 --> 01:30:12.000
Her Highness asked me to stay
and take care of you, General.


619
01:30:13.752 --> 01:30:15.045
She also asked you,

620
01:30:16.880 --> 01:30:19.216
to love me as if I were her.

621
01:32:55.205 --> 01:32:57.666
Why can't I hear your heartbeat?

622
01:33:21.773 --> 01:33:26.820
Welcome

623
01:33:26.903 --> 01:33:31.658
With the God of Tian Lang's blessing,
please drink this wine.


624
01:34:16.536 --> 01:34:18.205
Dear Princess,

625
01:34:19.247 --> 01:34:23.543
my brother has been waiting for you
for too long.


626
01:34:28.715 --> 01:34:32.677
He's been waiting for you patiently
as he sleeps.


627
01:34:33.637 --> 01:34:36.973
Your wedding ceremony is tomorrow.

628
01:34:38.225 --> 01:34:39.267
Go.

629
01:34:51.738 --> 01:34:53.865
He is the heir to the throne.

630
01:34:54.950 --> 01:34:59.204
Two months ago, a demon stole his heart.

631
01:35:21.268 --> 01:35:22.477
My pretty one, don't
you know who I am?

632
01:35:22.602 --> 01:35:23.770
I want your heart.

633
01:35:27.649 --> 01:35:33.488
Your Highness, you have a heart
that will quicken another.


634
01:35:34.114 --> 01:35:38.869
Only your heart can bring our prince
back to life.


635
01:35:42.789 --> 01:35:46.501
It will happen at the hour
of the solar eclipse.


636
01:35:47.294 --> 01:35:48.753
Your highness

637
01:35:49.045 --> 01:35:52.131
you are only here

638
01:35:52.132 --> 01:35:55.886
to help us with this divine ceremony.

639
01:35:55.969 --> 01:35:57.095
What we want from you...

640
01:35:57.220 --> 01:36:00.098
is nothing but your heart.

641
01:36:03.143 --> 01:36:04.060
Sir!

642
01:36:04.144 --> 01:36:05.020
The wine...

643
01:36:06.062 --> 01:36:06.938
The wine...

644
01:36:18.325 --> 01:36:22.704
Your heart will continue to beat
in my brother's chest.


645
01:36:22.787 --> 01:36:25.248
His blood will flow again

646
01:36:26.333 --> 01:36:28.543
and he will take the throne.

647
01:36:53.193 --> 01:36:58.198
My brother is returning.

648
01:37:00.909 --> 01:37:02.577
O, sons of the Tian Lang!

649
01:37:03.370 --> 01:37:06.665
Drink to your heart's content
for the next three days!


650
01:37:06.998 --> 01:37:10.627
Tian Lang Kingdom,
Valley of Ascending Spirits


651
01:37:10.752 --> 01:37:12.712
The resurrection of our prince
must come to pass


652
01:37:13.213 --> 01:37:19.511
with the blessing of the God
of our ancestors.


653
01:37:20.679 --> 01:37:23.098
The ceremony will be in the Valley
of Ascending Spirits.


654
01:37:23.223 --> 01:37:30.230
Your Majesty, please wait for the prince's
return in the central camp.


655
01:39:09.871 --> 01:39:11.331
Sister Fox Demon!

656
01:39:14.584 --> 01:39:15.960
You're Sister Fox Demon, aren't you?

657
01:39:20.840 --> 01:39:22.758
I...I've heard a lot about you,

658
01:39:22.759 --> 01:39:24.469
and I feel so honored to...

659
01:40:50.805 --> 01:40:52.348
Where have you been?

660
01:40:52.766 --> 01:40:55.185
I couldn't find you anywhere.
I almost believed you'd become a demon.


661
01:40:56.394 --> 01:40:57.896
I'd better be content to be human.

662
01:40:58.563 --> 01:41:00.189
I saw your fox demon sister today,

663
01:41:00.190 --> 01:41:01.816
and I was almost killed.

664
01:41:01.900 --> 01:41:02.984
Forget it.

665
01:41:03.651 --> 01:41:04.735
I'll never want to be a demon!

666
01:41:04.736 --> 01:41:07.155
What you saw was not my sister,
but the princess.


667
01:41:08.323 --> 01:41:09.532
The princess?

668
01:41:09.908 --> 01:41:11.367
They traded skins.

669
01:41:11.659 --> 01:41:14.120
My sister is bride in place
of the princess.


670
01:41:14.871 --> 01:41:17.290
The princess gave away her heart.

671
01:41:17.707 --> 01:41:19.375
She is now Xiao Wei.

672
01:41:19.459 --> 01:41:20.960
She'll soon become a demon!

673
01:41:21.836 --> 01:41:23.922
The marriage was a trap.

674
01:41:24.047 --> 01:41:26.883
All the escorts have been poisoned!

675
01:41:28.051 --> 01:41:31.346
I saw that they took Xiaowei
into a valley.


676
01:41:33.056 --> 01:41:36.267
Xiaowei has no magic.

677
01:41:36.976 --> 01:41:38.394
What can she do now?

678
01:41:45.735 --> 01:41:46.903
General Huo.

679
01:41:48.071 --> 01:41:49.197
General Huo.

680
01:41:50.448 --> 01:41:52.283
The princess hasn't left yet.

681
01:41:55.912 --> 01:41:59.207
She transformed into Xiaowei.
They traded skins.


682
01:42:03.253 --> 01:42:04.254
She is a demon.

683
01:42:04.754 --> 01:42:05.796
I order you to kill her.

684
01:42:05.797 --> 01:42:07.131
I'm already Huo Xin's woman.

685
01:42:07.257 --> 01:42:09.133
Is it because you loathed
her disfigured face?


686
01:42:09.384 --> 01:42:11.886
Why can't I hear your heartbeat?

687
01:42:12.887 --> 01:42:14.138
Her heart is beating inside
that fox demon!


688
01:42:14.472 --> 01:42:15.974
During the eclipse,

689
01:42:16.099 --> 01:42:17.809
she can get her heart back
from that fox demon!


690
01:42:18.726 --> 01:42:19.727
General Huo!

691
01:42:20.395 --> 01:42:24.148
If the princess devours a human heart,
she'll be a demon forever.


692
01:42:40.123 --> 01:42:41.541
Whenever it snowed,

693
01:42:42.834 --> 01:42:45.670
I had one more
gem embedded in its handle.

694
01:42:47.505 --> 01:42:52.635
The goldsmith said
there is only room for one more.


695
01:42:56.639 --> 01:42:58.182
No more room

696
01:42:59.809 --> 01:43:04.898
Can you smell the fragrance of azaleas
in the breeze?


697
01:43:06.149 --> 01:43:07.400
Your Highness, don't do it.

698
01:43:13.656 --> 01:43:14.574
Leave me.

699
01:43:16.034 --> 01:43:19.746
I am not your princess.
You have mistaken me.


700
01:43:23.791 --> 01:43:25.126
I am not...

701
01:43:25.585 --> 01:43:26.794
I am not...

702
01:43:32.717 --> 01:43:33.885
Jing.

703
01:43:38.056 --> 01:43:40.975
I was chosen as a royal guard

704
01:43:41.684 --> 01:43:43.603
when I was 14.

705
01:43:44.896 --> 01:43:46.064
The first time I saw you

706
01:43:46.564 --> 01:43:49.192
in armor was on the hunt,

707
01:43:51.402 --> 01:43:56.908
I dared to dream
to be with you forever.

708
01:43:59.827 --> 01:44:02.455
But I'm no longer your Jing any more.

709
01:44:03.498 --> 01:44:05.541
I am an ugly demon.

710
01:44:09.462 --> 01:44:12.465
I should have told you, you are the most
beautiful woman in the world.


711
01:44:16.594 --> 01:44:18.304
If I devour this heart,

712
01:44:19.305 --> 01:44:21.975
I will be the most beautiful woman
in the world again.


713
01:44:22.475 --> 01:44:24.268
I will never be the princess again.

714
01:44:25.770 --> 01:44:26.980
But we can spend
the rest of our lives together.


715
01:44:27.063 --> 01:44:27.981
Jing.

716
01:44:29.899 --> 01:44:31.192
Don't eat it.

717
01:44:32.318 --> 01:44:34.946
Let's leave together and
get your heart back.


718
01:44:39.659 --> 01:44:40.868
My heart?

719
01:44:45.373 --> 01:44:47.667
I thought you loved this body
more than anything else.


720
01:44:52.005 --> 01:44:54.132
I was under the
spell of the fox demon.

721
01:44:57.093 --> 01:44:59.637
At the time my
heart was only for you,

722
01:45:00.388 --> 01:45:02.015
but my eyes...

723
01:45:07.145 --> 01:45:10.148
...were drawn by this skin.

724
01:45:12.275 --> 01:45:14.986
No man can resist beauty.
You did nothing wrong.


725
01:45:16.029 --> 01:45:20.450
Let me eat this heart,
then we can pick azaleas together.


726
01:45:21.367 --> 01:45:22.410
Jing!

727
01:45:26.247 --> 01:45:28.374
It's my treacherous eyes
that brought you to this hell!


728
01:45:31.836 --> 01:45:34.547
Even if I see this skin 1000 times,

729
01:45:35.423 --> 01:45:37.633
I'd still be charmed by it.

730
01:45:42.472 --> 01:45:43.264
Huo Xin!

731
01:45:48.144 --> 01:45:49.312
Huo Xin!

732
01:46:09.749 --> 01:46:12.418
Beauty means nothing to us now.

733
01:46:15.630 --> 01:46:17.507
You no longer to devour a human heart.

734
01:46:21.761 --> 01:46:23.513
We should be happy together now.

735
01:46:25.765 --> 01:46:29.727
We're back to our old selves again.

736
01:46:31.270 --> 01:46:34.357
I'll spend the rest
of my life with you.

737
01:47:14.063 --> 01:47:22.063
When the sun is swallowed
by the God of Tian Lang...


738
01:47:25.616 --> 01:47:30.621
When a living heart beats
inside our prince...


739
01:47:32.165 --> 01:47:37.253
O Lord of All Things,

740
01:47:37.378 --> 01:47:40.798
please quicken his life.

741
01:48:17.376 --> 01:48:22.882
Again, the heart will beat.
Again, the blood will be warm.


742
01:48:26.552 --> 01:48:32.225
In the name of God, thy life
will be quickened.


743
01:48:37.480 --> 01:48:44.695
Once I departed,
carrying the woe of the willows.


744
01:48:47.531 --> 01:48:55.531
Today I returned in the midst
of the rain and snow.


745
01:48:58.584 --> 01:49:02.380
Great God of Tian Lang?

746
01:49:03.589 --> 01:49:04.548
Faster!

747
01:49:12.807 --> 01:49:14.267
I'm sleepy.

748
01:49:14.558 --> 01:49:15.643
Don't close your eyes.

749
01:49:15.935 --> 01:49:18.020
If you fall asleep, you'll never
wake again.


750
01:49:18.437 --> 01:49:20.231
Go and save Xiaowei!

751
01:49:21.607 --> 01:49:23.943
She's a good person.

752
01:49:25.111 --> 01:49:26.737
Love her as if she were me.

753
01:49:26.946 --> 01:49:27.780
Jing!

754
01:49:29.532 --> 01:49:31.867
I smell azaleas.

755
01:49:33.202 --> 01:49:34.161
Jing!

756
01:50:21.375 --> 01:50:28.466
Those who know me say,
Your heart is overflowing with sorrow.


757
01:50:31.260 --> 01:50:38.601
Those who know me not say,
What more do you want?


758
01:51:13.552 --> 01:51:18.432
The hallowed moment is coming!

759
01:52:09.400 --> 01:52:11.986
Watch out! My blood is on the blade!

760
01:52:14.029 --> 01:52:15.573
Don't come any closer.

761
01:52:28.961 --> 01:52:31.130
Quer, go!

762
01:52:33.215 --> 01:52:34.091
Quer!

763
01:52:50.483 --> 01:52:51.358
Quer!

764
01:52:52.610 --> 01:52:53.527
Quer!

765
01:52:53.861 --> 01:52:54.778
Quer!

766
01:52:55.821 --> 01:52:57.615
What's wrong with you? No!

767
01:52:58.032 --> 01:52:58.741
Quer!

768
01:52:58.742 --> 01:53:00.326
I am going now

769
01:53:00.451 --> 01:53:01.327
Quer!

770
01:53:03.746 --> 01:53:04.622
Quer!

771
01:53:06.040 --> 01:53:07.583
No! Quer!

772
01:53:07.708 --> 01:53:11.337
No! No! No! No!

773
01:53:11.462 --> 01:53:13.547
Come back! Quer!

774
01:53:13.672 --> 01:53:16.926
Come back! Come back!

775
01:53:17.092 --> 01:53:20.888
No! Quer! No!

776
01:56:07.429 --> 01:56:10.015
Watch out. He's behind you!

777
01:57:52.034 --> 01:57:53.827
Xiaowei is here.

778
01:57:55.037 --> 01:57:56.246
General Huo,

779
01:57:58.791 --> 01:57:59.875
hurry!

780
01:58:22.022 --> 01:58:23.440
If you want to be human,

781
01:58:25.025 --> 01:58:26.693
I'll give you my heart.

782
01:58:27.444 --> 01:58:29.071
I'll give it to you willingly.

783
01:58:35.118 --> 01:58:37.746
But return Jing's heart to her.

784
01:58:38.914 --> 01:58:40.707
Give her life back to her.

785
01:59:27.504 --> 01:59:33.010
Human hearts are warm,
and human tears are bitter.


786
01:59:39.308 --> 01:59:44.021
The azaleas smell really nice.

787
02:02:03.035 --> 02:02:04.077
Huo Xin...

788
02:02:14.671 --> 02:02:16.006
It's me.

789
02:02:23.263 --> 02:02:24.639
It's you.

790
02:02:28.143 --> 02:02:29.644
I heard it.

791
02:02:34.441 --> 02:02:35.567
That's right.

792
02:02:38.862 --> 02:02:40.530
That's exactly what it sounds like.

793
02:03:31.289 --> 02:03:33.208
A solar eclipse obscures the line

794
02:03:33.333 --> 02:03:37.712
between day and night
so it is the only time


795
02:03:38.296 --> 02:03:42.300
humans and demons can change places.

796
02:03:43.510 --> 02:03:45.720
For a demon to become a human,

797
02:03:46.221 --> 02:03:49.474
the human heart must be freely offered.

798
02:03:49.891 --> 02:03:51.768
Then the demon spirit will merge
with the human spirit,


799
02:03:51.893 --> 02:03:54.187
and become one with the human body.

800
02:03:54.688 --> 02:03:56.523
Until the end of the body's natural life.

801
02:04:15.917 --> 02:04:16.918
Quer!

802
02:04:18.712 --> 02:04:19.713
Quer!

803
02:04:33.351 --> 02:04:34.603
Quer!

804
02:04:39.816 --> 02:04:41.318
Is that you? Quer?

805
02:04:58.210 --> 02:05:04.210
