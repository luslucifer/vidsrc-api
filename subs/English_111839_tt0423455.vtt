1
00:00:15.314 --> 00:00:16.429
<i>Love?</i>

2
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.652
Must we?

3
00:00:26.325 --> 00:00:29.875
I was probably the worst bed partner
on five continents.


4
00:00:32.122 --> 00:00:34.284
All my life, idiotically,

5
00:00:36.084 --> 00:00:41.375
I thought that sex seemed to matter
so desperately to the man who wanted it


6
00:00:46.053 --> 00:00:47.919
an act of selfishness.

7
00:01:05.656 --> 00:01:08.148
Is what's happening on the outside.

8
00:01:09.326 --> 00:01:10.532
Action.

9
00:01:11.912 --> 00:01:13.287
Now, that,

10
00:01:13.288 --> 00:01:15.632
that was something to be shared.

11
00:01:18.418 --> 00:01:20.637
I've always felt most at home

12
00:01:21.421 --> 00:01:23.674
in the most difficult places.

13
00:01:27.594 --> 00:01:28.846
But love?

14
00:01:32.516 --> 00:01:34.473
I'm a war correspondent.

15
00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.818
Of course, there are wars...

16
00:01:44.736 --> 00:01:46.443
<i>...and there are wars.</i>

17
00:01:53.537 --> 00:01:54.787
Here we go.

18
00:01:54.788 --> 00:01:56.950
Pull! Look at that!

19
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.008
That's one son of a bitch.

20
00:02:06.091 --> 00:02:08.970
Yeah, but you're a son of a bitch, too.
Come on!


21
00:02:11.304 --> 00:02:13.170
But I know one thing he doesn't.

22
00:02:13.181 --> 00:02:14.467
Pull, for God's sakes.

23
00:02:19.271 --> 00:02:20.386
Hold on!

24
00:02:20.814 --> 00:02:21.861
Really?

25
00:02:22.649 --> 00:02:24.640
Come on, Papa! Bring him!

26
00:02:33.326 --> 00:02:35.067
Everything dies.

27
00:02:41.543 --> 00:02:44.160
<i>It was by pure chance
that I ever met him.</i>


28
00:02:50.177 --> 00:02:52.885
<i>There was this bar called Sloppy Joe's.</i>

29
00:02:57.642 --> 00:02:59.235
Okay!

30
00:02:59.311 --> 00:03:03.646
<i>"Who is that large, dirty man
in those disgustingly soiled clothes?"</i>


31
00:03:03.774 --> 00:03:04.980
My God!

32
00:03:05.901 --> 00:03:07.369
That's Ernest Hemingway.

33
00:03:07.444 --> 00:03:09.731
Papa, anoint the beast!

34
00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.366
No.

35
00:03:14.367 --> 00:03:15.903
That man appears to be indigen.

36
00:03:26.421 --> 00:03:28.378
Skinner, another drink.

37
00:03:28.381 --> 00:03:31.476
Don't look now, Papa,
but something's coming.


38
00:03:34.596 --> 00:03:35.848
Hey, how's it going?

39
00:03:39.392 --> 00:03:40.894
I've never kissed a fish.

40
00:03:41.728 --> 00:03:44.402
Sloppy Joe's tradition. 
Friend or foe?

41
00:03:44.773 --> 00:03:46.241
Or faux friend, you never know.

42
00:03:46.316 --> 00:03:48.273
You find out eventually.

43
00:03:48.735 --> 00:03:50.112
What's your name, elegance?

44
00:03:50.195 --> 00:03:51.902
Martha Gellhorn.

45
00:03:51.905 --> 00:03:56.536
Well, Gellhorn, big game's no fun
if it just wanders up to you.


46
00:03:59.162 --> 00:04:01.247
I can see what you aren't,

47
00:04:01.248 --> 00:04:03.990
I'm just trying to figure out
what the hell you are.


48
00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:08.089
If we have a drink,
am I gonna have to fight your husband?


49
00:04:09.172 --> 00:04:10.674
...My brother.

50
00:04:11.258 --> 00:04:12.931
That's my mother.

51
00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:15.000
In that case, I hope you're thirsty.

52
00:04:15.095 --> 00:04:17.052
You want to invite him over'?

53
00:04:20.767 --> 00:04:22.440
You want another?

54
00:04:27.315 --> 00:04:31.104
<i>Everybody Tells You You're Blonde?</i>
I find that hard to believe.


55
00:04:31.194 --> 00:04:32.275
You know the song?

56
00:04:32.821 --> 00:04:34.414
I know Italian.

57
00:04:36.116 --> 00:04:37.857
And I know the song.

58
00:05:25.498 --> 00:05:27.296
What do you think of that, boys?

59
00:05:36.134 --> 00:05:38.512
So what do you do, sophisticated?

60
00:05:38.845 --> 00:05:40.313
What do I do?

61
00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:43.131
Lately, I've been seeing the world.

62
00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:45.694
How is the world?

63
00:05:45.769 --> 00:05:48.022
It's surprising, occasionally.

64
00:05:48.855 --> 00:05:50.596
- Is that mine?
- Sure.


65
00:05:54.527 --> 00:05:56.200
A lot of rum in this rum.

66
00:05:56.321 --> 00:05:59.871
Well, in this joint, they don't drink
to get drunk, they drink to stay drunk.


67
00:05:59.872 --> 00:06:02.085
The clientele here scare you'?

68
00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.628
Scare me? No.

69
00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:06.248
No, I just got back from Berlin.

70
00:06:06.665 --> 00:06:08.713
Now, the Nazis?

71
00:06:09.042 --> 00:06:10.908
They're scary.

72
00:06:11.002 --> 00:06:13.002
Like smelly little boys
running around with Lugers.


73
00:06:14.881 --> 00:06:17.259
Blondes get a free pass in the Fatherland.

74
00:06:19.594 --> 00:06:20.937
So drink up.

75
00:06:21.012 --> 00:06:23.424
America's plush as the pope's bed.

76
00:06:23.515 --> 00:06:25.051
Don't be naive.

77
00:06:25.767 --> 00:06:28.227
Plenty of people still go hungry.

78
00:06:28.228 --> 00:06:30.640
You sound like Eleanor Roosevelt.

79
00:06:33.817 --> 00:06:37.447
- I've known the woman my whole life.
- Of course, you have.


80
00:06:37.529 --> 00:06:39.031
Let's see the review.

81
00:06:39.656 --> 00:06:41.704
- What?
- Come on, Gellhorn.


82
00:06:42.784 --> 00:06:45.071
Every writer keeps one review.

83
00:06:47.914 --> 00:06:51.464
Well, you can blame Mrs. Roosevelt.
She encouraged me to write it.


84
00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:54.953
It's called <i>The Trouble I've Seen</i>.

85
00:06:55.672 --> 00:06:57.413
The trouble you've seen?

86
00:06:57.507 --> 00:07:00.750
What was that?
Daddy loop to the country club'?


87
00:07:06.599 --> 00:07:08.431
"The book seems to be woven
not out of words,"


88
00:07:11.021 --> 00:07:15.265
"Who is this Martha Gellhorn?
Her writing burns."


89
00:07:16.109 --> 00:07:18.942
"Hemingway himself does not write
more authentic American..."


90
00:07:18.945 --> 00:07:20.936
As usual, the critic got it wrong.

91
00:07:20.947 --> 00:07:23.780
I mean, comparing me to you is ridiculous.

92
00:07:24.909 --> 00:07:26.161
All I really did was listen.

93
00:07:26.244 --> 00:07:27.496
It's their dialogue.

94
00:07:30.874 --> 00:07:32.670
I set out to cover grimy lives,

95
00:07:32.671 --> 00:07:35.910
and I ended up looking glamorous
on the cover of The Saturday Review.


96
00:07:36.921 --> 00:07:38.207
I have the same problem.

97
00:07:47.098 --> 00:07:48.350
I think I should go.

98
00:07:49.309 --> 00:07:52.939
- How much do I owe you?
- Please. I practically own the place.


99
00:07:53.146 --> 00:07:55.274
Papa, now we're really late.

100
00:07:55.899 --> 00:07:57.572
It's all right, I'm going.

101
00:07:57.650 --> 00:07:59.698
Buy yourself a new shirt, Hemingway.

102
00:07:59.819 --> 00:08:01.776
It was nice knowing you.

103
00:08:03.198 --> 00:08:04.484
Gellhorn.

104
00:08:04.574 --> 00:08:07.612
Come on, Papa. 
Pauline's gonna be mad.

105
00:08:08.578 --> 00:08:09.693
Who's Pauline?

106
00:08:12.123 --> 00:08:13.170
May I help you?

107
00:08:14.125 --> 00:08:16.253
Is this the Hemingway house?

108
00:08:16.961 --> 00:08:19.055
Yes. I'm Pauline Hemingway.

109
00:08:19.672 --> 00:08:20.878
Mrs. Hemingway.

110
00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:25.771
I met Mr. Hemingway at Sloppy Joe's.

111
00:08:25.845 --> 00:08:28.394
Yes, of course. Sloppy Joe's.

112
00:08:28.473 --> 00:08:30.146
Well, you're late.

113
00:08:30.225 --> 00:08:31.511
Come in.

114
00:08:49.869 --> 00:08:51.860
Such an interesting room.

115
00:08:56.793 --> 00:08:58.750
I can see he's not taking any chances.

116
00:08:58.753 --> 00:09:01.097
Ernest has read every word he writes
aloud to me.


117
00:09:01.172 --> 00:09:03.192
I'm his first pair of ears
and his first pair of eyes.


118
00:09:03.216 --> 00:09:05.924
So you're his muse.
That makes you very lucky.


119
00:09:07.345 --> 00:09:09.962
Great talent needs a great amount of care.

120
00:09:10.098 --> 00:09:13.068
But we've managed to make
a very happy life here.


121
00:09:13.184 --> 00:09:15.892
Ernest likes to surround himself
with exotic characters.


122
00:09:15.895 --> 00:09:17.761
Fascist propaganda!

123
00:09:25.572 --> 00:09:27.108
If he didn't have any support.

124
00:09:27.198 --> 00:09:30.075
Hitler and Mussolini,

125
00:09:30.076 --> 00:09:31.749
you see him here,

126
00:09:32.203 --> 00:09:36.925
are literally throwing money and weapons
to Franco and the fascists.


127
00:09:40.128 --> 00:09:41.587
And why?

128
00:09:41.588 --> 00:09:45.889
Because the only images the world sees
come from fascist propaganda.


129
00:10:03.318 --> 00:10:05.605
Fascism is on the move,
make no mistake.


130
00:10:05.612 --> 00:10:08.161
And what is happening in Spain is...

131
00:10:08.406 --> 00:10:10.898
It's a threat to our democracy as well.

132
00:10:15.455 --> 00:10:20.302
These people who are trying to defend
their democratically-elected government.


133
00:10:43.483 --> 00:10:45.474
Here you see some
of the Russian forces there,


134
00:10:45.485 --> 00:10:46.657
who are also in support.

135
00:10:47.946 --> 00:10:50.984
All young men, as you can see,
dedicated to <i>la causa</i>.


136
00:10:58.539 --> 00:11:01.338
Pauline, this is Mikhail Koltsov.
He's a Russian journalist.


137
00:11:01.339 --> 00:11:05.840
Koltsov is not just a journalist,
he's Stalin's eyes and ears.


138
00:11:05.922 --> 00:11:09.381
Only Russia supplies the loyalists
with arms, medicine,


139
00:11:13.429 --> 00:11:17.673
I would like to introduce
the director of this film, Joris Ivens,


140
00:11:17.684 --> 00:11:21.018
the great Dutch documentary filmmaker,

141
00:11:21.104 --> 00:11:22.845
who, with your help,

142
00:11:22.939 --> 00:11:26.068
will be able to return to Spain
and complete this film.


143
00:11:26.526 --> 00:11:28.517
- Beautiful.
- Excellent work.


144
00:11:28.528 --> 00:11:32.021
And it is also our great privilege
to have with us tonight


145
00:11:32.115 --> 00:11:35.904
a man who has seen firsthand
the horrors that Franco and the fascists


146
00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:38.038
are inflicting upon his people,

147
00:11:38.121 --> 00:11:41.489
he is also my very dear friend,
Professor Paco Zarra.


148
00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.593
Well, there are many heroes.

149
00:11:43.668 --> 00:11:46.968
I only wish I could have
brought them all with me tonight.


150
00:11:47.255 --> 00:11:49.383
But we are all counting on you
for your support.


151
00:11:53.386 --> 00:11:55.480
Well, if it isn't our host.

152
00:11:58.224 --> 00:11:59.897
- Hey, Joris!
- Hemingway.


153
00:11:59.976 --> 00:12:04.903
In case any of you are wondering
how to sign your checks,


154
00:12:05.773 --> 00:12:07.441
write with a Parker!

155
00:12:07.442 --> 00:12:10.059
- Write like Hemingway.
- Fame's a whore, Dos,


156
00:12:10.153 --> 00:12:12.827
doesn't mean to say
she can't do something good.


157
00:12:12.905 --> 00:12:14.157
I missed you, you prick.

158
00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:17.278
My book's outselling you
in Russia, you know.


159
00:12:17.285 --> 00:12:19.242
Can I say how
happy I am for you?

160
00:12:19.245 --> 00:12:21.202
You could, but that would ruin it.

161
00:12:22.165 --> 00:12:23.246
Gellhorn.

162
00:12:24.125 --> 00:12:26.799
Martha Gellhorn, 
John Dos Passos,

163
00:12:26.878 --> 00:12:29.973
greatest writer in America
not named Hemingway.


164
00:12:30.882 --> 00:12:32.134
John Dos Passos.

165
00:12:32.675 --> 00:12:34.837
Hemingway thinks writing is a blood sport.

166
00:12:35.553 --> 00:12:36.634
Don't kid yourself, Dos.

167
00:12:36.721 --> 00:12:39.600
Gellhorn here is a bestselling author.
I read her review.


168
00:12:40.475 --> 00:12:42.341
She's gunning for both of us.

169
00:12:42.435 --> 00:12:44.426
- And to think she never said a word!
- Excuse me.


170
00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:46.415
Sidney, darling, will you take
the boys out of here


171
00:12:46.439 --> 00:12:47.541
- and go play bullfighter or something?
- Sure.


172
00:12:47.565 --> 00:12:48.942
Here we go!

173
00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:52.170
The boys don't need
to see all of this.

174
00:12:52.195 --> 00:12:54.256
Come on, the boys should see
the world for what it is.


175
00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:55.280
Not tonight.

176
00:12:55.406 --> 00:12:58.114
- Paco Zarra.
- Very nice to meet you.


177
00:12:58.117 --> 00:12:59.824
Nice to meet you.

178
00:12:59.911 --> 00:13:01.832
- I admire what you're doing.
- Thank you.


179
00:13:01.833 --> 00:13:04.116
There's two sides
to this little war in Spain.


180
00:13:04.207 --> 00:13:06.335
You're only raising money for one of them.

181
00:13:06.459 --> 00:13:08.166
Why are you backing the communists?

182
00:13:08.169 --> 00:13:09.840
- Pauline...
- Mrs. Hemingway,


183
00:13:09.841 --> 00:13:11.794
communist is not the same as anti-fascist.

184
00:13:11.881 --> 00:13:14.555
Does anti-fascist mean you kill Catholics?

185
00:13:14.634 --> 00:13:17.217
Well, sadly, the Church has
allied itself with the fascists.


186
00:13:17.303 --> 00:13:20.637
I'm sorry,
but in this house, we are Catholics.


187
00:13:20.765 --> 00:13:23.018
Catholic in America is very different
than Catholic in Spain.


188
00:13:23.019 --> 00:13:25.179
I've heard the loyalists go
into people's homes,


189
00:13:25.186 --> 00:13:27.405
and God help you
if they find a cross on the wall.


190
00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:30.154
I'm not sure I believe all of that.

191
00:13:30.441 --> 00:13:32.211
What do you believe, dear?
Do you go to church?


192
00:13:32.235 --> 00:13:33.487
Actually, no.

193
00:13:33.611 --> 00:13:35.529
Gellhorn! Is that...

194
00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:37.032
I'm half Jewish.

195
00:13:37.782 --> 00:13:39.159
Is there such a thing?

196
00:13:40.785 --> 00:13:43.197
No, we're not closed-minded, dear.

197
00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:50.129
Now, Sidney's Jewish, too,
and he's just like family.


198
00:13:51.838 --> 00:13:54.808
Papa? Why don't you come back
to my country?


199
00:13:54.882 --> 00:13:57.848
If you told our story,
the world would listen.


200
00:13:57.849 --> 00:14:00.586
No writer alive has done more
to support the Spanish people,


201
00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:03.843
but my husband has a family right here
and a deadline on a novel.


202
00:14:03.933 --> 00:14:07.654
- And you?
- Well, I believe that the Spanish Civil War


203
00:14:07.728 --> 00:14:09.648
is just a dress rehearsal
for the next world war,


204
00:14:11.774 --> 00:14:13.694
And how the hell do you think
you'll manage that?


205
00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:15.908
You ever try to
get into a war zone?

206
00:14:15.987 --> 00:14:17.102
I'm resourceful.

207
00:14:21.367 --> 00:14:24.530
- I think you must come. I mean it.
- So, enough politics, it's late.


208
00:14:24.662 --> 00:14:26.710
Somebody has to get up in the morning
and write.


209
00:14:26.831 --> 00:14:28.754
Do you want to come this way?

210
00:14:28.833 --> 00:14:30.039
We need you.

211
00:14:34.046 --> 00:14:37.539
Pauline's right, you know, Hem.
We could all use a new Hemingway novel.


212
00:14:37.633 --> 00:14:41.001
Besides, we need some good men
on the domestic front.


213
00:14:48.394 --> 00:14:52.058
People from all over the world
are heading into Spain.


214
00:14:52.064 --> 00:14:56.274
Writers, poets, artists, laborers,

215
00:14:56.277 --> 00:14:59.247
all passionate believers in <i>la causa</i>.

216
00:14:59.405 --> 00:15:03.285
The people of Spain need to know
that help is on the way.


217
00:15:03.367 --> 00:15:06.826
I'm gonna sing you our song. Okay?
It starts like this.


218
00:16:03.302 --> 00:16:04.645
<i>I believed that all one did</i>

219
00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:07.132
<i>about a war was go to it
as a gesture of solidarity</i>


220
00:16:07.306 --> 00:16:11.027
<i>and get killed or, if lucky,
survive until the war was over.</i>


221
00:16:11.394 --> 00:16:16.685
<i>A knapsack and about $50.
That was my equipment for Spain.</i>


222
00:16:17.191 --> 00:16:19.603
<i>Anything more seemed unnecessary.</i>

223
00:16:21.571 --> 00:16:24.484
<i>Needed to get papers,
so I cajoled</i> a <i>friend at Collier's</i>


224
00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:27.824
<i>to write me a letter
naming me war correspondent,</i>


225
00:16:30.037 --> 00:16:32.324
<i>even though I had never written
a word about war.</i>


226
00:16:32.915 --> 00:16:34.383
Fancy collar.

227
00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:36.343
His name is Sandor.

228
00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:39.786
Hello, Sandor.

229
00:16:40.256 --> 00:16:42.668
What a beautiful collar you have.

230
00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:47.220
Rabbit's foot.

231
00:16:48.055 --> 00:16:49.227
It's good luck.

232
00:16:49.307 --> 00:16:52.049
I'm going to the front
to fight Franco and the fascists.


233
00:16:52.059 --> 00:16:54.107
- Good for you.
- Thank you.


234
00:16:54.312 --> 00:16:55.359
You?

235
00:16:56.606 --> 00:16:58.222
I'm a writer.

236
00:16:59.233 --> 00:17:00.485
With those legs?

237
00:17:01.444 --> 00:17:03.697
Actually, I don't use them to write.

238
00:17:03.698 --> 00:17:07.064
Though I once knew a man who played
the xylophone with his toes.


239
00:17:08.868 --> 00:17:10.211
It's true.

240
00:17:10.328 --> 00:17:11.500
Thank you.

241
00:17:16.375 --> 00:17:19.595
<i>When I looked at the faces of the men
in the international brigades,</i>


242
00:17:19.596 --> 00:17:22.056
<i>I found I loved them immeasurably.</i>

243
00:17:22.131 --> 00:17:25.226
<i>They were private citizens,
here at their own expense.</i>


244
00:17:25.343 --> 00:17:27.630
<i>They came to Spain for a cause,</i>

245
00:17:31.432 --> 00:17:35.642
<i>From this valley
they say you are going</i>


246
00:17:41.901 --> 00:17:46.111
<i>For they say you are taking the sunshine</i>

247
00:17:47.073 --> 00:17:50.737
<i>That has brightened the pathways awhile</i>

248
00:17:52.119 --> 00:17:56.238
<i>Come and sit by my
side if you love me</i>

249
00:17:57.124 --> 00:18:00.913
<i>Do not hasten to bid me adieu</i>

250
00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:06.476
<i>Just remember that red river valley</i>

251
00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:11.674
<i>And the boy who
has loved you so true</i>

252
00:18:17.937 --> 00:18:21.942
<i>Or how lonely and sad it will be</i>

253
00:18:22.983 --> 00:18:27.159
<i>And think of the fond hearts
you're breaking</i>


254
00:18:28.447 --> 00:18:31.667
<i>And the grief that you're causing to me</i>

255
00:18:33.619 --> 00:18:37.112
<i>Come and sit by my
side if you love me</i>

256
00:18:38.290 --> 00:18:41.954
<i>Do not hasten to bid me adieu</i>

257
00:18:43.629 --> 00:18:45.222
<i>Just remember...</i>

258
00:18:46.257 --> 00:18:48.351
Would you like some more wine,
Mr. Hemingway?


259
00:18:48.426 --> 00:18:49.769
Thank you.

260
00:18:57.518 --> 00:18:59.054
Smell that air!

261
00:18:59.603 --> 00:19:01.105
Spanish earth!

262
00:19:07.319 --> 00:19:09.026
Can I hitch a ride?

263
00:19:09.196 --> 00:19:11.813
You can't. It's too tough for a woman.

264
00:19:13.492 --> 00:19:17.861
<i>I had this feeling that
one had to work all day and all night,</i>


265
00:19:17.872 --> 00:19:21.331
<i>and love as many people as one could,
and do it all,</i>


266
00:19:21.751 --> 00:19:23.708
<i>do it all terribly fast.</i>

267
00:19:52.031 --> 00:19:54.739
Press release from Commissar Koltsov.

268
00:19:54.742 --> 00:19:56.409
Come on, baby.

269
00:19:56.410 --> 00:19:59.118
- Press release.
- We do it standing up, we make a tripod.


270
00:20:00.956 --> 00:20:03.630
Press release from Commissar Koltsov.

271
00:20:05.211 --> 00:20:07.009
You're not listening.

272
00:20:10.883 --> 00:20:12.806
Beat the fascists, you need to kill them.

273
00:20:12.885 --> 00:20:14.055
You're both wrong.

274
00:20:14.056 --> 00:20:16.431
You have to win over the peasants,
give them irrigation.


275
00:20:27.983 --> 00:20:29.906
- Gentlemen.
- Welcome to Spain!


276
00:20:29.907 --> 00:20:30.949
Papa!

277
00:20:31.278 --> 00:20:35.249
- Now we gonna beat that bastard Franco!
- Hey!


278
00:20:36.033 --> 00:20:37.740
You still like <i>cocido madrileño</i>?

279
00:20:37.827 --> 00:20:40.865
Hell, yes, Lupe.
Why do you think I came back to Spain?


280
00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:42.786
For you!

281
00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:47.627
A true honor.

282
00:20:47.628 --> 00:20:51.292
I am Mikhail Koltsov, and I always say,

283
00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:54.259
"Ernest Hemingway is America's Tolstoy."

284
00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:55.260
Papa.

285
00:20:55.344 --> 00:20:57.438
- Have a drink.
- Gentlemen.


286
00:20:59.098 --> 00:21:00.441
Boy, this is a surprise.

287
00:21:00.516 --> 00:21:03.133
I didn't think Pauline was gonna
let you off the leash.


288
00:21:03.227 --> 00:21:04.513
Look at that!

289
00:21:05.396 --> 00:21:07.683
That help you get laid, Dos?

290
00:21:08.190 --> 00:21:09.601
- Papa!
- Mr. Hemingway!


291
00:21:09.608 --> 00:21:12.020
- Papa, what you gonna do to Franco?
- Why did you come here?


292
00:21:12.111 --> 00:21:17.163
I'm here with director Joris Ivens
and my good friend, John Dos Passos.


293
00:21:18.367 --> 00:21:20.285
We're gonna make a movie.

294
00:21:20.286 --> 00:21:22.664
We're gonna show the world
the noble struggle


295
00:21:22.746 --> 00:21:25.158
of those defending
the elected government of Spain.


296
00:21:26.959 --> 00:21:27.959
Hey, What's that?

297
00:21:48.022 --> 00:21:49.480
Here, pass it back.

298
00:21:49.481 --> 00:21:52.815
It's Russian! It's Russian.
It's one of ours.


299
00:21:54.278 --> 00:21:56.235
Is there a doctor here?

300
00:22:03.412 --> 00:22:05.005
Is this a woman?

301
00:22:05.164 --> 00:22:06.905
- She made it.
- I know. It's great.


302
00:22:15.674 --> 00:22:17.540
Well, look who's here.

303
00:22:19.053 --> 00:22:20.976
Well, hello, Hemingway.

304
00:22:21.597 --> 00:22:24.009
You know how to make an entrance.

305
00:22:24.475 --> 00:22:25.943
Why? Jealous?

306
00:22:26.769 --> 00:22:30.063
All Cinderella had was a pumpkin.

307
00:22:30.064 --> 00:22:32.055
Cinderella needs a drink.

308
00:22:38.197 --> 00:22:40.689
Joris. Dos. Hello, Paco.

309
00:22:41.158 --> 00:22:43.866
- I told you I'd make it.
- <i>Si</i>, thank you.


310
00:22:43.953 --> 00:22:45.034
Glad to be here.

311
00:22:45.454 --> 00:22:47.866
I'm so happy you're here.
Welcome to Madrid.


312
00:22:48.916 --> 00:22:50.168
In here?

313
00:22:55.631 --> 00:22:57.042
On, boy.

314
00:22:57.049 --> 00:23:00.053
Attaboy, let it out.
You're one tough Hungarian, my friend.


315
00:23:02.513 --> 00:23:05.598
Hey, where's the front?
It's supposed to be around here.


316
00:23:05.599 --> 00:23:06.599
Twelve blocks away.

317
00:23:06.684 --> 00:23:08.391
Follow the streetcar tracks.

318
00:23:08.394 --> 00:23:11.398
Just past the university.
You can't miss it.


319
00:23:20.739 --> 00:23:22.730
- I'm Martha Gellhorn.
- Who?


320
00:23:23.409 --> 00:23:24.695
Martha Gellhorn.

321
00:23:28.914 --> 00:23:30.120
From <i>Collier's</i>.

322
00:23:31.583 --> 00:23:34.052
You have something from <i>Collier's</i>?

323
00:23:36.922 --> 00:23:38.333
I do.

324
00:23:43.053 --> 00:23:44.726
War correspondent?

325
00:23:44.805 --> 00:23:46.273
In name only.

326
00:23:51.979 --> 00:23:53.390
Needed that.

327
00:23:53.689 --> 00:23:55.908
You're a long way from Sloppy Joe's.

328
00:23:56.025 --> 00:23:57.948
Pull in your claws, kitten.

329
00:23:58.110 --> 00:23:59.396
I was always gonna be here.

330
00:23:59.653 --> 00:24:01.246
Okay, sign here.

331
00:24:01.822 --> 00:24:04.371
- Room 428.
- Four twenty-eight?


332
00:24:04.825 --> 00:24:07.567
You're on the safe side of the building.

333
00:24:08.162 --> 00:24:09.277
Hey, Capa!

334
00:24:09.788 --> 00:24:11.290
Look what we got here.

335
00:24:11.373 --> 00:24:13.421
A real war correspondent.

336
00:24:14.168 --> 00:24:15.579
Another one.

337
00:24:15.794 --> 00:24:18.138
It's getting crowded at the bar, you know.

338
00:24:18.297 --> 00:24:22.894
Closest most of them get to a gun is
standing next to a soldier in the pissoir.


339
00:24:23.010 --> 00:24:26.344
Not this one. Martha Gellhorn,
meet my Hungarian friend, Robert Capa.


340
00:24:26.805 --> 00:24:28.478
Capa. Nice to meet you.

341
00:24:29.266 --> 00:24:30.677
I know your photographs.

342
00:24:30.768 --> 00:24:33.476
- Need another drink?
- Need a bath.


343
00:24:33.562 --> 00:24:35.690
Sidney! Bath.

344
00:24:35.814 --> 00:24:39.057
- Really, I can turn a spigot.
- No hot water. Need to boil.


345
00:24:39.777 --> 00:24:41.279
Need to sleep.

346
00:24:43.113 --> 00:24:45.036
I'm on the same floor.

347
00:24:50.954 --> 00:24:52.422
Look at that.

348
00:24:53.916 --> 00:24:56.260
Her legs begin at her shoulders.

349
00:25:29.201 --> 00:25:30.737
It's all yours.

350
00:26:03.610 --> 00:26:05.078
Hemingway!

351
00:26:05.737 --> 00:26:08.081
Hemingway! Open the door!

352
00:26:09.199 --> 00:26:10.405
Come on! Let...

353
00:26:10.659 --> 00:26:12.400
Let me out of here!

354
00:26:12.995 --> 00:26:14.338
Hemingway!

355
00:26:38.937 --> 00:26:40.980
How dare you, bastard!

356
00:26:40.981 --> 00:26:42.597
Excuse me, sweetness?

357
00:26:42.608 --> 00:26:45.155
Why the hell would
you lock me in here?

358
00:26:45.156 --> 00:26:49.817
In case you hadn't noticed, Gellhorn,
as you're the only blonde in the joint,


359
00:26:50.115 --> 00:26:52.527
but there's a city of men, desperate men,

360
00:26:52.659 --> 00:26:54.707
some of whom know they're gonna die,

361
00:26:54.786 --> 00:26:56.379
death frees the beast.

362
00:26:56.455 --> 00:26:58.549
Do I need to tell you
what these bastards could do


363
00:26:58.624 --> 00:27:01.457
to a big, creamy bitch
like you in the dark?


364
00:27:08.091 --> 00:27:11.311
The best way to find out
if you can trust somebody


365
00:27:11.970 --> 00:27:13.586
is to trust him.

366
00:27:52.678 --> 00:27:54.089
Werner, you're right.

367
00:27:54.179 --> 00:27:55.647
This is the best angle.

368
00:27:57.099 --> 00:27:58.891
- Camera here.
- Yeah.


369
00:27:58.892 --> 00:28:03.887
Look! Look! They're arriving! It's the
Marseillaise Battalion from France.


370
00:28:03.981 --> 00:28:05.813
We can see Papineau from Canada.

371
00:28:11.405 --> 00:28:12.873
Abraham Lincoln Brigade.

372
00:28:16.952 --> 00:28:19.114
- Werner, you're getting this, right?
- Yeah.


373
00:28:24.376 --> 00:28:25.912
Okay, let's go downstairs.

374
00:28:31.883 --> 00:28:33.419
Coming?

375
00:28:33.552 --> 00:28:34.724
Yeah.

376
00:28:39.766 --> 00:28:41.268
Later, ladies.

377
00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:13.797
Brooklyn! Brooklyn!

378
00:29:19.097 --> 00:29:21.020
Gellhorn! Come on!

379
00:29:24.853 --> 00:29:26.355
Wait! Wait up!

380
00:29:36.365 --> 00:29:39.164
Papa, wait! Papa!

381
00:29:44.623 --> 00:29:45.670
Right there!

382
00:29:55.550 --> 00:29:57.962
Hey, look,
they're showing your movie.


383
00:29:58.053 --> 00:29:59.100
Not my movie.

384
00:29:59.179 --> 00:30:02.547
- You didn't like it?
- Never saw it. Heard they loused it up.


385
00:30:02.766 --> 00:30:06.134
I agree. I think they miscast
Helen Hayes as Catherine Barkley.


386
00:30:06.269 --> 00:30:07.521
- Yeah?
- Yeah!


387
00:30:08.313 --> 00:30:10.111
Everyone's a critic.

388
00:30:19.533 --> 00:30:21.627
Look, Werner. Look. 
All those people.

389
00:30:22.494 --> 00:30:24.326
- Hey, Dos! Get over here!
- Right.


390
00:30:25.372 --> 00:30:27.625
- Joris, come on.
- Say, "Cheese."


391
00:31:05.036 --> 00:31:06.242
Jesus. Irrigation.

392
00:31:06.329 --> 00:31:07.694
What's wrong with irrigation?

393
00:31:07.706 --> 00:31:09.925
Nothing,
if you like watching guys dig ditches.


394
00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.412
We do our job right,
we make people want to watch.


395
00:31:12.502 --> 00:31:15.540
Come on. There's a goddamn war to film.

396
00:31:16.047 --> 00:31:18.391
This is why there's a goddamn war, Hem.

397
00:31:18.467 --> 00:31:21.926
A year ago, these people were shot
for stepping on this land.


398
00:31:34.107 --> 00:31:35.393
<i>It made you proud to see</i>

399
00:31:35.484 --> 00:31:38.317
<i>the joy and determination
of the Spanish people.</i>


400
00:31:43.742 --> 00:31:44.994
<i>And we could not lose.</i>

401
00:31:53.210 --> 00:31:55.127
<i>To rule this country,</i>

402
00:31:55.128 --> 00:31:58.462
<i>Franco would have to do away
with 20 million of those brave souls.</i>


403
00:32:11.061 --> 00:32:12.472
Tastes like freedom.

404
00:32:13.021 --> 00:32:16.264
Dos, that may be the worst line
you ever came up with,


405
00:32:16.399 --> 00:32:17.867
which is saying something.

406
00:32:17.943 --> 00:32:20.230
Well, that may be, but it's true.

407
00:32:25.033 --> 00:32:26.617
You're an idealist.

408
00:32:26.618 --> 00:32:29.622
Who wants to irrigate when
fascists have a boot on your neck?


409
00:33:01.570 --> 00:33:03.732
How are our filmmakers today?

410
00:33:04.990 --> 00:33:06.105
Paco!

411
00:33:08.451 --> 00:33:10.158
Yes, he's here!

412
00:33:10.161 --> 00:33:12.084
- It's Paco!
- Wait! That's Uncle Paco!


413
00:33:13.415 --> 00:33:14.792
Paco! Paco!

414
00:33:18.211 --> 00:33:20.134
This could be the
best shot in the film!

415
00:33:21.381 --> 00:33:24.476
There's fighting five kilometers from here.
Let's go!


416
00:33:24.926 --> 00:33:26.849
That's where we should be!
Let's go, come on!


417
00:33:33.184 --> 00:33:34.925
Get your clothes dirty!

418
00:33:35.604 --> 00:33:38.904
- Hey, Dos! Coming?
- I know what fighting looks like.


419
00:33:39.524 --> 00:33:40.810
I'm staying here.

420
00:34:42.962 --> 00:34:44.919
No! Werner, get back!

421
00:34:45.173 --> 00:34:47.039
Get down, get down, get down.

422
00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:51.001
Up! Paco!

423
00:34:53.682 --> 00:34:54.763
Let's get close.

424
00:35:09.364 --> 00:35:10.832
What is that?

425
00:35:11.199 --> 00:35:12.576
What? What is it?

426
00:35:19.666 --> 00:35:23.159
<i>Red dogs,
your leaders have sent you here to die!</i>


427
00:35:24.462 --> 00:35:27.762
<i>General Franco is willing
to give his blood for you.</i>


428
00:35:33.805 --> 00:35:35.273
You trying to get us killed?

429
00:35:42.897 --> 00:35:44.149
<i>Surrender now!</i>

430
00:35:50.989 --> 00:35:53.663
- Take it till you get Paco!
- <i>Surrender now!</i>


431
00:36:04.669 --> 00:36:05.716
Fascist bastards!

432
00:36:13.052 --> 00:36:14.645
You told the bastards off.

433
00:36:15.054 --> 00:36:16.340
Madrid is protected.

434
00:36:16.890 --> 00:36:19.359
Yes, it is protected

435
00:36:20.894 --> 00:36:21.975
for today.

436
00:36:25.273 --> 00:36:26.388
Are you okay?

437
00:37:14.239 --> 00:37:15.582
Watercress.

438
00:37:21.371 --> 00:37:25.251
With this, I can eat a truck tire
wrapped in chili peppers


439
00:37:25.333 --> 00:37:27.165
and sleep like a baby.

440
00:37:35.176 --> 00:37:36.587
Wild onions.

441
00:37:37.470 --> 00:37:40.087
Locals say, "Eat two onions a day",

442
00:37:41.307 --> 00:37:43.264
"you'll live to be 100."

443
00:37:49.357 --> 00:37:50.609
They say

444
00:37:51.025 --> 00:37:53.904
it is a taste one must acquire.

445
00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:23.812
Paco!

446
00:38:24.809 --> 00:38:26.152
Paco, my friend!

447
00:38:27.687 --> 00:38:30.657
Come! We must talk. Please.

448
00:38:34.694 --> 00:38:38.153
Hey, it's okay. You leave him there.
We'll talk for two minutes.


449
00:38:43.369 --> 00:38:45.918
- Slide in.
- In the car? Why?


450
00:38:47.498 --> 00:38:48.784
Okay, go.

451
00:38:59.552 --> 00:39:01.896
So how'd you learn
to have fun in hell?

452
00:39:02.263 --> 00:39:03.879
Family vacations.

453
00:39:10.688 --> 00:39:12.190
She says she has your coat.

454
00:39:12.357 --> 00:39:15.395
My... No. No, no. Tell her she's...
This is not my coat.


455
00:39:18.363 --> 00:39:21.401
She says it is your coat,
and that's why she's giving it to you.


456
00:39:21.407 --> 00:39:23.751
No, tell her... No, thank... No...

457
00:39:24.327 --> 00:39:27.875
- Beautiful, but no, I can't accept...
- Then you must pay her something.


458
00:39:27.876 --> 00:39:29.966
Pay her? I can't afford the coat!

459
00:39:30.375 --> 00:39:32.537
I can't afford! 
No, thank you.

460
00:39:34.963 --> 00:39:37.967
She's simply asking if you like
this coat of yours.


461
00:39:38.549 --> 00:39:42.395
- I like it, yes. Beautiful. But not for me...
- For Christ's sakes! Don't you get it'?


462
00:39:42.470 --> 00:39:44.143
Look. There. Now...

463
00:39:44.263 --> 00:39:47.233
Now, it is your coat,
just as she said from the beginning.


464
00:39:50.687 --> 00:39:53.907
If you don't mind wearing
the clothes of the dead.


465
00:39:54.399 --> 00:39:56.561
Now can we go celebrate?

466
00:40:14.752 --> 00:40:16.709
Hungarian, where is Sandor?

467
00:40:17.422 --> 00:40:19.129
Sandor is gone.

468
00:40:19.924 --> 00:40:21.790
- He will come back.
- No, he won't.


469
00:40:21.801 --> 00:40:24.350
You never know
when he will turn up.


470
00:40:27.724 --> 00:40:31.092
And have the waiters
say our <i>nada</i>. You art in <i>nada</i>.


471
00:40:31.227 --> 00:40:33.605
Nada be thy <i>nada</i>.
Thy will be nada as it is in <i>nada</i>.


472
00:40:33.688 --> 00:40:36.783
Give us this <i>nada</i>,
our daily <i>nada, nada, nada</i>...


473
00:40:39.902 --> 00:40:42.189
Hey, Dos! Do we bore you?

474
00:40:44.073 --> 00:40:45.996
Paco should be here by now.

475
00:40:46.075 --> 00:40:49.295
Drink up, for Christ's sake,
the man's invincible.


476
00:40:49.787 --> 00:40:54.634
He probably just stepped off to seek relief
from one of our <i>hors de combat</i> here.


477
00:40:55.793 --> 00:40:56.965
Relax.

478
00:40:57.587 --> 00:40:59.453
Even a Time magazine cover boy

479
00:40:59.547 --> 00:41:03.040
needs to drink with the lowlifes
every once in a while.


480
00:41:03.301 --> 00:41:04.769
Lay off, Hem.

481
00:41:16.647 --> 00:41:17.762
Do you speak English?

482
00:41:17.857 --> 00:41:19.359
Have you seen Paco Zarra?

483
00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:21.577
Have you seen him today since...

484
00:41:40.213 --> 00:41:41.829
Hey, Sidney.

485
00:41:42.381 --> 00:41:43.553
Go get her.

486
00:41:45.593 --> 00:41:46.765
This one's for you, Papa!

487
00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:14.248
You were at the irrigation project
today, right?


488
00:42:14.249 --> 00:42:15.362
Yes, sir, I was.

489
00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:19.206
I don't know.

490
00:42:19.293 --> 00:42:20.374
Have you seen him recently?

491
00:42:21.254 --> 00:42:22.534
- No?
- No, I haven't. I'm sorry.


492
00:42:39.397 --> 00:42:41.064
On...

493
00:42:41.065 --> 00:42:43.284
Just outside the hotel, this.

494
00:42:44.068 --> 00:42:45.445
Look, even with bombs falling,

495
00:42:45.528 --> 00:42:47.798
her mother wanted to make sure
she was wearing her best coat.


496
00:42:47.822 --> 00:42:48.869
- Yes.
- Aw.


497
00:42:49.782 --> 00:42:51.739
Except it's buttoned wrong. Look.

498
00:42:51.742 --> 00:42:52.948
There wasn't time.

499
00:42:52.952 --> 00:42:53.952
Yes, yes, yes.

500
00:42:54.662 --> 00:42:58.838
You capture that human theme.
That need to do something, to...


501
00:42:59.584 --> 00:43:03.623
To exert control even when your world
is spinning out of control.


502
00:43:03.713 --> 00:43:05.579
Yes. You understand.

503
00:43:07.842 --> 00:43:09.310
I want to do what you do.

504
00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:13.765
I do. I want to do it,
I want to write the way you take pictures.


505
00:43:16.017 --> 00:43:18.179
There's so much going on
in this war, so much.


506
00:43:18.269 --> 00:43:21.307
And yet when I sit down,
when I start to write, nothing.


507
00:43:21.314 --> 00:43:22.930
Nothing. I can...

508
00:43:30.948 --> 00:43:33.497
The pictures are there, you just take them.

509
00:43:33.576 --> 00:43:35.704
If your pictures aren't good enough,

510
00:43:36.287 --> 00:43:37.880
you're not close enough.

511
00:43:38.372 --> 00:43:40.534
But you have the talent.

512
00:43:40.625 --> 00:43:42.161
It is not enough to have talent.

513
00:43:42.251 --> 00:43:44.470
You also have to be Hungarian.

514
00:44:26.671 --> 00:44:30.676
I must you to
know I am General Petrov.

515
00:44:31.425 --> 00:44:36.295
I am a great admirer of you,
figure of goddess,


516
00:44:37.139 --> 00:44:38.937
and it would be honor

517
00:44:39.642 --> 00:44:41.110
for you to...

518
00:44:43.104 --> 00:44:45.232
...dance with me. No, come.

519
00:44:45.314 --> 00:44:47.180
- Come.
- Dance? No, no. No.


520
00:44:47.191 --> 00:44:48.858
You are a goddess.

521
00:44:48.859 --> 00:44:49.906
Dance.

522
00:44:51.529 --> 00:44:54.021
No, no. Come. Come, come. Now.

523
00:44:54.031 --> 00:44:55.592
- Me?
- No, come. Come to dance with me now.


524
00:44:55.616 --> 00:44:58.028
- Hey.
- Come, come, come.


525
00:45:01.664 --> 00:45:04.827
What I am doing here?
I am doing seduction of beautiful woman.


526
00:45:05.459 --> 00:45:07.200
Come on, I'm not your property.

527
00:45:07.295 --> 00:45:10.333
Say just the two of us step outside,
<i>mi general</i>?


528
00:45:17.930 --> 00:45:19.728
We make duel.

529
00:45:21.767 --> 00:45:24.259
How about a little Russian roulette?

530
00:45:24.353 --> 00:45:26.310
Yeah'?

531
00:45:26.397 --> 00:45:28.013
Sidney, pistol!

532
00:45:30.026 --> 00:45:32.245
- Come on.
- Sidney!


533
00:45:48.753 --> 00:45:50.289
This is madness, what are you doing?

534
00:46:06.103 --> 00:46:07.639
- Ready?
- Wait!


535
00:46:07.772 --> 00:46:09.638
Wait. Wait. Wait, wait.

536
00:46:10.107 --> 00:46:12.064
Go back to typewriter, journalist.

537
00:46:12.693 --> 00:46:15.105
Please wait.
Please, as both of you are about to die,


538
00:46:15.196 --> 00:46:17.995
or one of you, either way,
it will be regrettable,


539
00:46:17.996 --> 00:46:20.243
but one thing must be had first.

540
00:46:21.118 --> 00:46:23.405
The honor of Russia is at stake.

541
00:46:23.537 --> 00:46:24.948
Fuck Russia.

542
00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:27.906
Vodka! Vodka.

543
00:46:28.584 --> 00:46:30.120
Vodka. Vodka.

544
00:46:30.461 --> 00:46:32.509
Made for Peter the Great.

545
00:46:32.588 --> 00:46:36.684
Vodka. Vodka. Vodka. Vodka.

546
00:46:38.135 --> 00:46:40.627
One last drink before you die.

547
00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:53.853
One last. Just one. With caviar.

548
00:46:55.152 --> 00:46:56.825
On real bread.

549
00:46:57.363 --> 00:46:59.036
With music.

550
00:47:09.500 --> 00:47:10.843
Simmer down, Papa.

551
00:47:11.127 --> 00:47:13.336
Come on, we have a film to make.

552
00:47:13.337 --> 00:47:14.680
Take it easy.

553
00:47:23.722 --> 00:47:27.147
The thing one comes to know about war
are not so simple.


554
00:47:27.685 --> 00:47:30.353
Did you say, "Fuck Russia"?

555
00:47:30.354 --> 00:47:31.640
So what if I did?

556
00:47:32.523 --> 00:47:34.935
Well, I say fuck America!

557
00:47:35.067 --> 00:47:36.933
My country is here.

558
00:47:37.111 --> 00:47:38.647
Where is yours?

559
00:47:40.030 --> 00:47:44.069
He's right, America should be here.
The whole world should be here.


560
00:47:44.076 --> 00:47:47.535
The fascists are trampling Spain,
and you two are comparing testicles.


561
00:47:48.038 --> 00:47:49.631
It's ridiculous.

562
00:47:54.962 --> 00:47:56.077
No.

563
00:47:56.255 --> 00:47:57.598
We cooked the goat.

564
00:47:57.673 --> 00:47:59.209
No, not Sandor!

565
00:48:00.134 --> 00:48:01.545
No!

566
00:48:01.677 --> 00:48:03.054
You eat!

567
00:48:05.431 --> 00:48:09.220
Sometimes sacrifice is an art.

568
00:48:51.936 --> 00:48:54.815
<i>Past the street barricades,
the only sound you heard</i>


569
00:48:54.897 --> 00:48:58.140
<i>was a machine gun hammering
in the University city</i>


570
00:49:00.277 --> 00:49:01.620
<i>and a bird.</i>

571
00:49:10.704 --> 00:49:13.924
It was a crazy war.
We could take a streetcar to the front.


572
00:49:23.801 --> 00:49:26.179
Get this. Get that. Are you getting it?
Are we getting it?


573
00:49:26.180 --> 00:49:27.646
Yeah, yeah. I lost the...

574
00:49:28.764 --> 00:49:31.893
<i>The front was only blocks away,
it was very cold,</i>


575
00:49:31.976 --> 00:49:35.071
<i>and the thuds of mortar shells
were all around,</i>


576
00:49:35.813 --> 00:49:38.191
<i>but we had a film to make.</i>

577
00:49:39.650 --> 00:49:40.936
Set the camera here.

578
00:49:41.151 --> 00:49:42.824
Get down!

579
00:49:43.112 --> 00:49:45.035
There's stray bullets everywhere.

580
00:50:00.045 --> 00:50:01.160
Look at that.

581
00:50:01.171 --> 00:50:03.879
Fucking grace under pressure.

582
00:50:06.927 --> 00:50:08.179
- Hey, <i>tú</i>!
- Get down!


583
00:50:10.055 --> 00:50:11.341
Get down!

584
00:50:33.912 --> 00:50:35.255
Francisco!

585
00:50:39.752 --> 00:50:40.952
You sure taught them a lesson.

586
00:50:41.003 --> 00:50:43.882
You lobbed grenades
right onto their fascist asses.


587
00:50:43.964 --> 00:50:45.671
Good. They deserve it.

588
00:50:48.969 --> 00:50:51.882
One day, Felipe here is
a champion jai alai player,


589
00:50:51.972 --> 00:50:54.132
and the next,
he's hurling grenades instead of <i>pelotas</i>.


590
00:50:54.183 --> 00:50:55.264
Listen to Hemingway.

591
00:50:55.351 --> 00:50:57.820
You'd think his side was winning the war.

592
00:50:57.895 --> 00:50:59.886
There's atrocities on both sides.

593
00:50:59.897 --> 00:51:03.117
The important thing is
to report with objectivity.


594
00:51:03.233 --> 00:51:04.610
Objectivity?

595
00:51:05.110 --> 00:51:07.397
Fuck all your objectivity shit.

596
00:51:08.030 --> 00:51:09.566
What got into her?

597
00:51:09.573 --> 00:51:11.166
Hemingway, no doubt.

598
00:51:44.149 --> 00:51:45.651
There's a cat?

599
00:51:46.110 --> 00:51:47.612
That's no cat.

600
00:51:48.362 --> 00:51:51.241
That's no cat. 
That's no cat!

601
00:51:53.158 --> 00:51:54.205
Gellhorn!

602
00:52:06.296 --> 00:52:07.343
Gellhorn!

603
00:52:15.305 --> 00:52:17.774
Mama. Mama.

604
00:52:18.976 --> 00:52:20.262
Mama.

605
00:52:22.187 --> 00:52:23.439
Come on.

606
00:52:35.075 --> 00:52:36.668
Come with me.

607
00:52:37.035 --> 00:52:38.525
Come with me.

608
00:52:38.537 --> 00:52:39.652
<i>Mama!</i>

609
00:52:41.165 --> 00:52:42.451
Mama.

610
00:52:50.966 --> 00:52:52.309
It's okay.

611
00:52:56.305 --> 00:52:57.841
Are you fucking stupid?

612
00:52:58.182 --> 00:53:00.890
You are not supposed to charge out
in the middle of a shelling.


613
00:53:00.976 --> 00:53:04.606
Little boys are not supposed
to see their mothers bleed to death.


614
00:53:05.147 --> 00:53:06.353
Sarita.

615
00:53:06.356 --> 00:53:09.098
- No.
- Check the boy. Get him some water.


616
00:53:17.034 --> 00:53:19.526
- I've got blood on my hands. I can't...
- Then, wash it off.


617
00:53:24.041 --> 00:53:26.032
Gellhorn.

618
00:53:26.043 --> 00:53:28.000
Wash your hands.

619
00:53:36.804 --> 00:53:38.795
More coming!

620
00:53:54.404 --> 00:53:56.395
Bravest woman I ever saw.

621
00:54:46.331 --> 00:54:47.799
Spying, Gellhorn?

622
00:54:49.167 --> 00:54:50.214
No.

623
00:54:55.966 --> 00:54:58.799
What are you, just a fucking war tourist?

624
00:55:01.513 --> 00:55:02.628
Um...

625
00:55:03.557 --> 00:55:04.638
I...

626
00:55:07.060 --> 00:55:09.051
I can't write. I can't...

627
00:55:11.398 --> 00:55:13.981
I'm trying and I can't get anything.

628
00:55:16.904 --> 00:55:17.985
I...

629
00:55:18.280 --> 00:55:19.566
I feel like I don't know enough.

630
00:55:19.656 --> 00:55:22.694
I don't know enough about
the war and about...


631
00:55:23.201 --> 00:55:26.000
About the military and about... I just...

632
00:55:29.958 --> 00:55:31.301
I don't...

633
00:55:32.878 --> 00:55:37.177
The only thing that really interests me
is people and their lives,


634
00:55:37.178 --> 00:55:38.915
their daily lives, that's...

635
00:55:41.428 --> 00:55:42.680
And I...

636
00:55:47.768 --> 00:55:49.361
There's nothing to writing, Gellhorn.

637
00:55:51.396 --> 00:55:53.683
All you do is sit down
at your typewriter and bleed.


638
00:55:57.986 --> 00:56:00.239
Do what you did in Appalachia,

639
00:56:00.530 --> 00:56:03.079
write about ordinary people, and war

640
00:56:03.241 --> 00:56:04.527
and Madrid.

641
00:56:09.873 --> 00:56:11.125
No, I...

642
00:56:11.208 --> 00:56:14.963
- It's just I...
- Fucking get in the ring, Gellhorn.


643
00:56:15.087 --> 00:56:17.670
See what you're made of.

644
00:56:17.798 --> 00:56:21.098
Start throwing some punches
for what you believe in.


645
00:56:24.763 --> 00:56:26.857
Fucking war correspondent.

646
00:56:32.145 --> 00:56:33.738
So, what?

647
00:56:53.875 --> 00:56:57.596
<i>As the bombs fall, you know
what the people in the square are thinking,</i>


648
00:56:57.597 --> 00:56:59.578
<i>"I must get home."</i>

649
00:57:00.841 --> 00:57:03.003
<i>Somehow, you do not believe
you can get killed.</i>


650
00:57:19.359 --> 00:57:20.611
Gellhorn!

651
00:57:21.611 --> 00:57:24.023
Gellhorn. Come on, we got to get out.

652
00:57:47.345 --> 00:57:48.597
My God.

653
00:57:49.306 --> 00:57:52.139
You have the most goddamn sexual legs.

654
00:58:43.401 --> 00:58:44.744
Is this what you want?

655
00:58:45.779 --> 00:58:47.452
It's what I need.

656
01:00:35.013 --> 01:00:37.482
So, how did you get this?

657
01:00:38.141 --> 01:00:39.814
Fell off a ladder.

658
01:00:42.979 --> 01:00:44.902
Skylight fell on me.

659
01:00:44.981 --> 01:00:46.597
Really?

660
01:00:49.069 --> 01:00:50.446
And your leg?

661
01:00:50.528 --> 01:00:52.196
Italy. Mortar.

662
01:00:52.197 --> 01:00:54.188
An Austrian Minenwerfer.

663
01:00:54.199 --> 01:00:57.294
Three Italians with me
had their legs blown off.


664
01:00:58.370 --> 01:01:00.166
God, that must have been bad.

665
01:01:00.167 --> 01:01:01.870
No, I was lucky, knee's still attached.

666
01:01:01.873 --> 01:01:04.706
Kept a bowl by my bed
for all the metal they took out.


667
01:01:04.709 --> 01:01:07.258
Two hundred and twenty seven pieces.

668
01:01:07.545 --> 01:01:12.210
They awarded me the <i>Croce Al Merito
Di Guerra</i> with three citations.


669
01:01:13.009 --> 01:01:14.545
And he's a hero, too.

670
01:01:14.552 --> 01:01:16.384
I hate the hero words.

671
01:01:16.471 --> 01:01:21.102
And "sacred," "glorious," "sacrifice."

672
01:01:22.519 --> 01:01:25.227
Never saw a damn thing that was sacred.

673
01:01:28.525 --> 01:01:31.199
Goddamn foot fungus.

674
01:01:31.778 --> 01:01:32.893
What?

675
01:01:32.904 --> 01:01:35.191
Bullfighters are plagued by it.

676
01:01:35.198 --> 01:01:39.567
The great matador, Don Junero,
gave me this amazing powder.


677
01:01:44.207 --> 01:01:45.550
I think it was Don Junero.

678
01:01:45.667 --> 01:01:47.010
You think?

679
01:01:48.837 --> 01:01:51.716
The important thing for a writer
is to tell a good story.


680
01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:56.542
- So, is it true about the scars?
- Of course, it's true.


681
01:02:01.433 --> 01:02:03.561
The best ones are all liars.

682
01:03:04.245 --> 01:03:07.795
<i>It's hard to say exactly
the moment you fall in love with someone.</i>


683
01:03:07.874 --> 01:03:11.333
<i>But I knew with him the exact moment
when I knew! had.</i>


684
01:03:13.505 --> 01:03:15.178
<i>And I knew why.</i>

685
01:03:15.256 --> 01:03:19.500
<i>In that instant, it was his words.
The ones I would never hear.</i>


686
01:03:19.636 --> 01:03:22.105
<i>Whatever private thing he uttered.</i>

687
01:03:59.467 --> 01:04:00.810
Hemingway!

688
01:04:04.305 --> 01:04:05.648
Hemingway!

689
01:04:08.518 --> 01:04:09.861
Hemingway!

690
01:04:28.455 --> 01:04:29.957
Have you seen Hemingway?

691
01:04:56.107 --> 01:04:58.064
<i>The hotel was being transformed</i>

692
01:04:58.151 --> 01:05:00.950
<i>into a vast triage for the wounded.</i>

693
01:05:02.447 --> 01:05:07.078
<i>And it still had all the old furniture,
but it smelled, it smelled of ether.</i>


694
01:05:07.410 --> 01:05:09.993
<i>And it was crowded with bandaged men.</i>

695
01:05:27.889 --> 01:05:28.889
Capa!

696
01:05:30.683 --> 01:05:31.855
Have you seen Hemingway?

697
01:05:31.935 --> 01:05:33.642
I know that voice.

698
01:05:34.437 --> 01:05:36.599
- Brooklyn.
- Gellhorn.


699
01:05:42.403 --> 01:05:43.609
How are you?

700
01:05:44.781 --> 01:05:46.875
I'm... I'm fine.

701
01:05:48.076 --> 01:05:51.171
- And you'? How are you'?
- I'm aces, now that you're here.


702
01:05:53.706 --> 01:05:55.208
But the Hungarian.

703
01:05:55.959 --> 01:05:57.427
Hey, where is he?

704
01:06:04.759 --> 01:06:06.887
Ask me a different question.

705
01:06:11.266 --> 01:06:13.132
Let me get you a drink.

706
01:06:13.476 --> 01:06:15.308
No, wait, wait. 
Wait, wait, wait.

707
01:06:19.148 --> 01:06:20.559
I want you to have this.

708
01:06:20.650 --> 01:06:22.812
It'll make you lucky.

709
01:06:28.241 --> 01:06:30.619
I'm gonna get you a drink.

710
01:06:35.665 --> 01:06:36.837
Here.

711
01:06:39.836 --> 01:06:41.452
There's Papa.

712
01:06:46.843 --> 01:06:48.709
I'll take care of him.

713
01:06:56.352 --> 01:06:59.026
In the event
that Madrid should fall...


714
01:06:59.188 --> 01:07:00.690
Madrid will never fall.

715
01:07:00.773 --> 01:07:03.185
In the event Madrid should fall,

716
01:07:03.192 --> 01:07:08.449
there should be no evidence of the extent
of Russian intervention in Spain.


717
01:07:08.990 --> 01:07:10.037
Why can't we film this?

718
01:07:10.116 --> 01:07:12.210
Now, let me be direct.

719
01:07:13.161 --> 01:07:15.209
Zarra's brother

720
01:07:15.788 --> 01:07:18.337
is a colonel with Franco.

721
01:07:18.416 --> 01:07:21.376
It's a civil war. 
Brother fights brother.

722
01:07:21.377 --> 01:07:25.348
In this instance, Moscow believe
brother might not be fighting brother.


723
01:07:25.465 --> 01:07:28.207
What, they think Paco is a spy?

724
01:07:28.801 --> 01:07:31.543
I saw him kill half a dozen fascists
in one afternoon.


725
01:07:31.721 --> 01:07:35.214
Can you think of a better way
to get anti-fascists to trust you'?


726
01:07:35.224 --> 01:07:36.224
And you believe this?

727
01:07:36.309 --> 01:07:38.562
I'm afraid it does not
matter what I believe.


728
01:07:38.645 --> 01:07:43.606
Moscow is not comfortable with a leader
whose brother sits at Franco's side.


729
01:07:47.070 --> 01:07:49.539
Something may happen.

730
01:07:50.740 --> 01:07:52.413
What kind of something?

731
01:07:58.081 --> 01:07:59.424
Fair trial?

732
01:08:05.672 --> 01:08:08.551
- A man knows his friends.
- In Spain,


733
01:08:08.633 --> 01:08:14.311
Russians can be very good to know.
We control access to all brigades.


734
01:08:14.430 --> 01:08:15.511
And?

735
01:08:15.598 --> 01:08:17.885
Our comrade, Dos Passos...

736
01:08:20.770 --> 01:08:24.940
...is making it hard for Moscow
to continue granting this.


737
01:08:24.941 --> 01:08:26.534
Bullshit.

738
01:08:26.609 --> 01:08:30.102
Dos may be a genius of an ass,
but no one is more anti-fascist.


739
01:08:30.196 --> 01:08:36.670
No one doubts the man's ideals,
I am talking about his behavior.


740
01:08:37.578 --> 01:08:43.802
You cannot deny that Dos Passos,
you might say, is in love with Paco Zarra.


741
01:08:50.967 --> 01:08:52.300
War runs on rumors.

742
01:08:52.301 --> 01:08:54.463
Let me be even more direct.

743
01:08:54.762 --> 01:09:00.895
If it appears that Paco Zarra is a spy,
and if it appears that Dos Passos,


744
01:09:01.561 --> 01:09:06.818
the man making this movie with you,
is involved with a spy,


745
01:09:09.610 --> 01:09:12.648
then my hands are tied.

746
01:09:14.866 --> 01:09:17.153
What the hell are you suggesting?

747
01:09:19.162 --> 01:09:22.917
I am suggesting that you tell Dos Passos

748
01:09:22.999 --> 01:09:26.879
that men should not be so emotional.

749
01:09:28.212 --> 01:09:34.174
Tell him to act more like
a man Hemingway would write about.


750
01:09:51.486 --> 01:09:54.285
Hem, did he tell you anything about Paco?

751
01:09:55.865 --> 01:09:57.242
Hem?

752
01:10:10.546 --> 01:10:13.288
<i>Two years later,
Koltsov was arrested</i>


753
01:10:16.761 --> 01:10:18.889
<i>He truly believed in Stalin.</i>

754
01:10:19.889 --> 01:10:24.975
<i>I sometimes wonder what he believed
as Stalin's thugs were dragging him off</i>


755
01:10:25.061 --> 01:10:27.189
<i>to put a bulletin his head.</i>

756
01:11:00.763 --> 01:11:04.307
Mr. Hemingway,
how strong and how big you are!


757
01:11:04.308 --> 01:11:07.102
Your writing is phony! It's pompous!

758
01:11:07.103 --> 01:11:09.936
My writing pompous?
Your voice is pompous!


759
01:11:10.648 --> 01:11:11.695
Damn faggot!

760
01:11:15.361 --> 01:11:18.490
Funny how a man has
to prove himself manly, I wonder why?


761
01:11:22.785 --> 01:11:26.335
You overrated, ass-kissing narcissists!

762
01:11:27.790 --> 01:11:31.829
Fuck that blowhard! 
I'll narrate it myself.

763
01:11:33.462 --> 01:11:35.624
I like that idea, Hemingway. Let's try it.

764
01:11:35.715 --> 01:11:39.379
Yeah, son also drinks
a little too much out of war.


765
01:11:39.468 --> 01:11:41.846
- Hello, Orson.
- John, I quit!


766
01:11:41.929 --> 01:11:45.024
What?
What do you mean you quit?


767
01:11:45.099 --> 01:11:48.524
This Spanish earth
is hard and dry,


768
01:11:54.317 --> 01:11:57.810
This worthless land, with water,
will yield much.


769
01:11:58.070 --> 01:12:00.535
For 50 years, we've wanted to irrigate...

770
01:12:00.536 --> 01:12:02.784
This is working! This is working.
This is much better.


771
01:12:02.867 --> 01:12:05.747
Joris, what the hell's going on?
I just ran into Welles, he says he quit!


772
01:12:06.370 --> 01:12:08.830
Quit? I fired his ass.

773
01:12:08.831 --> 01:12:11.505
You what? You fired... He can't...

774
01:12:11.626 --> 01:12:14.209
You don't know the first thing
about narrating a film, Hem!


775
01:12:14.295 --> 01:12:15.879
Fucking actors.

776
01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:19.373
Turn the projector off, stop, stop.
Turn the lights on.


777
01:12:19.717 --> 01:12:22.182
With Orson Welles narrating,
it was too theatrical.


778
01:12:22.183 --> 01:12:24.852
But with Hemingway,
we now hear a natural voice, a real voice,


779
01:12:24.931 --> 01:12:28.902
a man who has actually been to Spain
and wants to tell the world.


780
01:12:28.903 --> 01:12:30.691
Trust me. This is working.

781
01:12:30.770 --> 01:12:31.851
Okay.

782
01:12:31.938 --> 01:12:34.225
Gellhorn, incoming bombs.

783
01:12:36.943 --> 01:12:39.617
Everybody else ready? Music.

784
01:12:41.447 --> 01:12:43.404
Projector.

785
01:12:43.407 --> 01:12:46.377
Hemingway, you ready? And, action!

786
01:12:59.006 --> 01:13:02.465
Before, death came
when you were old or sick,


787
01:13:02.551 --> 01:13:05.168
but now it comes to all this village,

788
01:13:05.388 --> 01:13:08.392
high in the sky and shining silver.

789
01:13:08.933 --> 01:13:13.473
It comes to all who have no place to run,
no place to hide.


790
01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:16.699
Three Junker planes did this.

791
01:13:18.275 --> 01:13:21.996
This worthless land, with water,
will yield much.


792
01:13:22.405 --> 01:13:27.252
For 50 years, we've wanted to irrigate,
but they've held us back.


793
01:13:27.743 --> 01:13:32.249
Now, we will bring water to it,
to raise food for the defenders of Madrid.


794
01:13:32.331 --> 01:13:35.130
That was my line. 
Now it's Hem's?

795
01:13:37.378 --> 01:13:39.176
Hey, wait, Joris.

796
01:13:39.255 --> 01:13:43.431
Joris, where's the shot
of Paco on horseback?


797
01:13:44.093 --> 01:13:45.853
You said that was the
best shot of the film.


798
01:13:52.601 --> 01:13:54.763
Here it is. Paco!

799
01:13:55.938 --> 01:13:58.771
Wait a second, what is this?

800
01:13:59.734 --> 01:14:02.203
You've taken him out of the film entirely?

801
01:14:02.278 --> 01:14:03.325
Shh!

802
01:14:06.782 --> 01:14:08.876
For Christ's sake, 
Dos, calm down.

803
01:14:08.951 --> 01:14:11.625
Cuts have to be made
to make the film move better.


804
01:14:11.746 --> 01:14:14.295
It's film making, Dos.
There are aesthetic decisions.


805
01:14:17.001 --> 01:14:18.801
And now he's telling you
Paco needs to be cut.


806
01:14:18.836 --> 01:14:20.336
Paco is...

807
01:14:20.337 --> 01:14:22.203
It's for balance, it's for the film's good.

808
01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:28.511
Don't insult me.
I risked my life to film this war.


809
01:14:28.512 --> 01:14:31.129
Yes, and Paco risked his fighting it.

810
01:14:32.850 --> 01:14:36.343
For God's sake, Hem,
you don't do this to a friend.


811
01:14:38.230 --> 01:14:41.473
Why is it, whenever I mention Paco...

812
01:14:42.902 --> 01:14:44.438
What is it you're not telling me?

813
01:14:45.321 --> 01:14:47.733
Something I don't think
you'd have the stomach to hear.


814
01:14:53.162 --> 01:14:55.779
Or it's something you don't have
the stomach to say.


815
01:14:56.373 --> 01:14:58.171
It's all right, Dos.

816
01:14:59.210 --> 01:15:02.453
Nobody says a coward
can't make a great writer.


817
01:15:07.259 --> 01:15:08.670
You should go off and write.

818
01:15:10.638 --> 01:15:13.676
We could use a
new book by Dos Passos.

819
01:15:32.868 --> 01:15:36.031
<i>After Spain, 
Dos Passos changed.</i>

820
01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:44.995
<i>But because of what happened to Paco,
his politics moved far to the right.</i>


821
01:15:47.550 --> 01:15:51.098
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
tonight the American Writers' Congress,</i>


822
01:15:51.099 --> 01:15:54.065
<i>which is sponsored by
the League of American Writers,</i>


823
01:15:54.140 --> 01:15:58.805
<i>is proud to present the first motion
picture of Spain's battlefront.</i>


824
01:15:59.436 --> 01:16:01.234
<i>Directed by Joris Ivens,</i>

825
01:16:01.730 --> 01:16:05.826
<i>and written by Ernest Hemingway
in collaboration with John Dos Passos.</i>


826
01:16:13.159 --> 01:16:14.570
There are people...

827
01:16:14.660 --> 01:16:17.277
- Shut up. Shut up!
- What are you doing?


828
01:16:20.249 --> 01:16:22.240
God, get off.

829
01:16:22.585 --> 01:16:24.542
- Fuck.
- Fuck you!


830
01:16:26.380 --> 01:16:28.590
- This is your fault.
- My fault?


831
01:16:28.591 --> 01:16:30.582
You don't remember me shoving you
up against a wall


832
01:16:30.593 --> 01:16:32.550
and trying to shove your hand
into my knickers.


833
01:16:33.262 --> 01:16:34.343
Cunt.

834
01:16:36.015 --> 01:16:38.928
You want to emasculate me now,
in front of the world?


835
01:16:41.604 --> 01:16:43.220
I get it.

836
01:16:43.564 --> 01:16:45.271
I get it now.

837
01:16:45.357 --> 01:16:48.236
Hemingway has stage fright.

838
01:16:49.153 --> 01:16:50.826
Is that it?

839
01:16:51.947 --> 01:16:53.062
Okay.

840
01:17:05.586 --> 01:17:07.873
This totally feels like horse hair.

841
01:17:09.298 --> 01:17:12.757
And you, in this fucking fur coat.

842
01:17:22.561 --> 01:17:23.642
Papa.

843
01:17:25.314 --> 01:17:26.657
You're on.

844
01:17:29.568 --> 01:17:31.184
You're gonna be fine.

845
01:17:33.697 --> 01:17:34.777
<i>Now, ladies and gentlemen,</i>

846
01:17:35.407 --> 01:17:37.535
<i>just back from the Spanish front,</i>

847
01:17:37.536 --> 01:17:41.505
<i>my friend, my hero, 
Ernest Hemingway.</i>

848
01:17:47.127 --> 01:17:48.299
Papa, come on!

849
01:18:15.197 --> 01:18:17.029
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

850
01:18:17.241 --> 01:18:18.493
<i>I am a writer.</i>

851
01:18:20.119 --> 01:18:23.749
<i>So, the last thing a writer
should be asked to do is talk.</i>


852
01:18:24.790 --> 01:18:26.133
Excuse me.

853
01:18:30.504 --> 01:18:32.723
<i>Fascists may destroy cities,</i>

854
01:18:34.216 --> 01:18:37.436
<i>but the earth will outlive
all systems of tyranny.</i>


855
01:18:39.054 --> 01:18:41.398
<i>For those who have
entered the earth honorably,</i>


856
01:18:41.473 --> 01:18:45.774
<i>and no men ever entered earth more
honorably than those who died in Spain,</i>


857
01:18:46.937 --> 01:18:49.406
<i>have already achieved immortality.</i>

858
01:18:51.400 --> 01:18:54.233
<i>The film you are going to see
is about such men.</i>


859
01:18:56.405 --> 01:18:58.203
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

860
01:18:58.449 --> 01:18:59.792
The Spanish Earth.

861
01:19:10.419 --> 01:19:12.759
<i>Just a minute, ladies and gentlemen,
just a minute.</i>


862
01:19:12.760 --> 01:19:15.042
<i>I see we have
a very special guest here,</i>

863
01:19:15.424 --> 01:19:17.768
<i>a woman who has shared
our adventures in Spain.</i>


864
01:19:18.177 --> 01:19:19.793
<i>A writer for Collier's magazine,</i>

865
01:19:19.928 --> 01:19:23.296
<i>please give a warm welcome
to Martha Gellhorn.</i>


866
01:19:38.947 --> 01:19:40.779
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

867
01:19:42.368 --> 01:19:45.611
<i>people speak of the glory of battle,</i>

868
01:19:45.704 --> 01:19:49.880
<i>the sweep of governments,
the majesty of leaders,</i>


869
01:19:49.958 --> 01:19:56.125
<i>but go into the ravaged towns and hold
the hand of a starving, half-burned child,</i>


870
01:19:56.840 --> 01:19:58.706
<i>and you will know differently.</i>

871
01:19:59.718 --> 01:20:00.924
<i>My job,</i>

872
01:20:01.428 --> 01:20:02.634
<i>our job,</i>

873
01:20:03.180 --> 01:20:07.356
<i>is to give voice to the voiceless,
to bear witness to the innocent</i>


874
01:20:07.976 --> 01:20:12.095
<i>and to expose the lies
that mask evil with glorious rhetoric.</i>


875
01:20:32.835 --> 01:20:34.371
- Right here, Papa.
- One more?


876
01:20:34.378 --> 01:20:37.175
- Right here, right here, sir.
- Mr. Hemingway!


877
01:20:37.176 --> 01:20:38.219
Appreciate it, sir.

878
01:20:38.298 --> 01:20:41.040
- Papa! Papa!
- Got some good shots. Yes, sir.


879
01:20:41.635 --> 01:20:43.279
- Wait here, Papa.
- One more before you go.


880
01:20:43.303 --> 01:20:46.011
- Mr. Hemingway? Mr. Hemingway?
- Thank you. Very nice. Thank you.


881
01:20:46.014 --> 01:20:47.630
Good job. Thanks a lot.

882
01:20:47.724 --> 01:20:50.341
Thanks a lot, guys. 
That was good.

883
01:20:51.103 --> 01:20:52.789
Get you guys back on the way out.
Thanks again, guys.


884
01:20:52.813 --> 01:20:54.082
Thank you, sir. 
Thank you for coming.

885
01:20:54.106 --> 01:20:55.625
- Absolutely.
- Thank you for your support.


886
01:20:55.649 --> 01:20:57.515
Let me give you one of these pamphlets.

887
01:20:57.609 --> 01:21:01.273
One for you here, sir, explaining
everything about the cause in Spain.


888
01:21:01.363 --> 01:21:03.707
Spain got my juices flowing, Max.

889
01:21:03.782 --> 01:21:06.615
The work's good. 
I've got a great title.

890
01:21:06.702 --> 01:21:08.864
That's what editors like to hear.

891
01:21:09.371 --> 01:21:11.533
<i>For Whom the Bell Tolls.</i>

892
01:21:11.540 --> 01:21:13.406
John Donne.

893
01:21:13.417 --> 01:21:19.288
"Each man's death diminishes me,
for I am involved in mankind,"


894
01:21:19.590 --> 01:21:23.504
"Therefore, ask not for
whom the bell tolls,"


895
01:21:24.470 --> 01:21:26.053
"It tolls for thee."

896
01:21:26.054 --> 01:21:28.148
It's going to be his best novel.

897
01:21:28.432 --> 01:21:30.651
Believe me, I've edited all of them.

898
01:21:30.726 --> 01:21:34.026
Every time I think he can't
get any better, he does.


899
01:21:34.396 --> 01:21:36.262
It is the mark of a great writer.

900
01:21:38.358 --> 01:21:40.725
Exactly. I know.

901
01:21:40.736 --> 01:21:41.908
You should know.

902
01:21:41.987 --> 01:21:44.661
I could say the same
about your articles for <i>Collier's</i>.


903
01:21:45.657 --> 01:21:49.150
Believe me, Scribner's is interested,
if you ever want to write a book.


904
01:21:49.244 --> 01:21:50.530
Really?

905
01:21:50.621 --> 01:21:54.740
You can't filch her, Perkins.
I've got her locked up at <i>Collier's</i>.


906
01:21:54.917 --> 01:21:57.011
Stories are so good, we want more.

907
01:21:57.794 --> 01:22:02.095
Actually, you know, I wasn't sure
that gals have the stuff


908
01:22:02.549 --> 01:22:03.926
to be war reporters.

909
01:22:08.430 --> 01:22:11.400
Joris, Joris. Great film.
Narration's over the top, though.


910
01:22:12.351 --> 01:22:14.024
Doing...

911
01:22:14.102 --> 01:22:15.570
There he is.

912
01:22:17.564 --> 01:22:20.181
- Critic!
- Let me give you a piece of...


913
01:22:21.527 --> 01:22:22.779
Get over here.

914
01:22:23.820 --> 01:22:25.163
Pardon me for a minute.

915
01:22:25.405 --> 01:22:27.396
- Critic!
- Easy, Hem.


916
01:22:27.574 --> 01:22:29.247
Easy? Nobody shits on your work.

917
01:22:31.119 --> 01:22:32.291
I need another drink.

918
01:22:34.081 --> 01:22:35.367
Hello, Hemingway.

919
01:22:35.582 --> 01:22:37.084
Hello, Eastman. I was just...

920
01:22:37.292 --> 01:22:38.544
Max.

921
01:22:44.758 --> 01:22:46.590
I don't believe I do.

922
01:22:46.677 --> 01:22:51.137
"His talent's been outstripped by fear
of his flagging masculinity."


923
01:22:57.646 --> 01:22:58.818
Then you said,

924
01:23:00.148 --> 01:23:03.482
"Come out from behind that false
hair on your chest, Ernest."


925
01:23:04.319 --> 01:23:06.117
"We all know you."

926
01:23:07.197 --> 01:23:09.780
Well, you memorized it.

927
01:23:15.664 --> 01:23:17.655
Come on, Papa, you're not sore?

928
01:23:17.791 --> 01:23:20.829
No. I just want
to discuss it with you.

929
01:23:22.921 --> 01:23:24.036
- See?
- God.


930
01:23:24.131 --> 01:23:25.929
Do you see that?

931
01:23:26.008 --> 01:23:28.420
That's what a man looks like.

932
01:23:28.552 --> 01:23:30.259
My lord, you're serious.

933
01:23:30.345 --> 01:23:33.679
Let's see what you got on your chest,
you fucking nancy!


934
01:23:36.893 --> 01:23:38.008
No, no. Hem! Hem!

935
01:23:38.020 --> 01:23:39.272
Son of a bitch!

936
01:23:39.354 --> 01:23:41.277
No, that's it. Move away. Come on.

937
01:23:41.481 --> 01:23:43.609
I got a hairier chest than you, pal.

938
01:23:43.775 --> 01:23:45.118
Hairier!

939
01:23:46.945 --> 01:23:48.652
Papa! Right here, Papa!

940
01:23:49.072 --> 01:23:51.359
Second-rate son of a bitch!

941
01:23:54.369 --> 01:23:56.781
Don't you know adultery is a sin?

942
01:23:57.497 --> 01:23:59.864
This is a Catholic home!

943
01:23:59.875 --> 01:24:02.037
You are never getting a divorce.

944
01:24:03.128 --> 01:24:06.041
I won't see you destroyed by some,

945
01:24:07.299 --> 01:24:09.131
some Gellhorn.

946
01:24:10.385 --> 01:24:12.934
You told me you loved me so much,

947
01:24:13.889 --> 01:24:16.381
that love was all that mattered.

948
01:24:19.102 --> 01:24:23.892
Your love is just something
mounted on the wall.


949
01:24:24.691 --> 01:24:31.188
Your love is... Doesn't...
Dirty little sex tricks you taught me


950
01:24:31.281 --> 01:24:34.501
that you probably learned
from one of your whores!


951
01:24:35.243 --> 01:24:37.951
Haven't I cared for you through your rages,

952
01:24:38.038 --> 01:24:40.257
and your jealousies

953
01:24:40.832 --> 01:24:42.823
and your meanness?

954
01:24:43.919 --> 01:24:47.253
I told the world you were a genius.
I gave you all of this.


955
01:24:49.383 --> 01:24:52.933
Manly Hemingway. All of this!

956
01:24:54.054 --> 01:24:55.590
All of this!

957
01:24:57.557 --> 01:25:00.777
To prove you're not a mama's boy.

958
01:25:16.201 --> 01:25:18.329
Telling everyone that yours is bigger?

959
01:25:18.412 --> 01:25:20.961
- I know the truth!
- Pauline!


960
01:25:22.249 --> 01:25:23.501
What are you doing?

961
01:25:23.583 --> 01:25:25.119
Take them out of here.

962
01:25:25.961 --> 01:25:27.522
- Take them out of here!
- Whatever you say, Pauline.


963
01:25:27.546 --> 01:25:29.626
- What's wrong with Mommy?
- Come on, boys. Let's go.


964
01:25:29.881 --> 01:25:31.622
- What's the matter?
- Up to your room.


965
01:25:32.134 --> 01:25:34.512
Do our boys mean nothing to you?

966
01:25:36.304 --> 01:25:38.716
You think I'm going to let you
leave me like you left Hadley?


967
01:25:38.849 --> 01:25:40.522
This time, you're staying married.

968
01:25:40.523 --> 01:25:45.307
You think that this Gellhorn
cares about you?


969
01:25:45.772 --> 01:25:47.729
She is using you!

970
01:25:48.483 --> 01:25:53.205
She will not be your muse.
She will leave you a broken man.


971
01:25:54.990 --> 01:25:56.606
What do you want?

972
01:25:57.617 --> 01:25:59.119
What do you want?

973
01:26:39.409 --> 01:26:40.752
Who wants a Papa Doble?

974
01:26:41.119 --> 01:26:43.204
- Pape whose's?
- Papa Doble.


975
01:26:43.205 --> 01:26:45.788
Two and a half jiggers
Bacardi White Label rum,


976
01:26:45.874 --> 01:26:50.721
juice of two limes, half a grapefruit,
plus six drops of Maraschino.


977
01:26:51.254 --> 01:26:55.043
You whir the whole mess with shaved ice
in an electric mixer,


978
01:26:55.050 --> 01:26:56.757
and you're ready to rumba.

979
01:26:57.594 --> 01:27:01.258
I invented the damn drink, and I own
the house record in drinking them.


980
01:27:01.264 --> 01:27:02.470
Seventeen.

981
01:27:02.557 --> 01:27:05.106
- You're on, son.
- Count me in.


982
01:27:05.185 --> 01:27:07.597
- Right.
- Double sawbuck to the winner.


983
01:27:12.609 --> 01:27:13.815
- Spain.
- Spain!


984
01:27:13.902 --> 01:27:15.996
- The death of fascism.
- Yeah!


985
01:28:02.993 --> 01:28:04.609
Nineteen.

986
01:28:05.120 --> 01:28:09.216
I swear by Christ, you're more of a man
than most men I've met.


987
01:28:10.125 --> 01:28:11.593
Just say that I won.

988
01:28:11.960 --> 01:28:14.122
- You didn't win.
- No, say it. Say it. I won.


989
01:28:14.212 --> 01:28:16.681
We're taking a break. 
We'll call it a draw.

990
01:28:17.299 --> 01:28:20.303
Draw, my ass, God damn it. I won!

991
01:28:20.635 --> 01:28:23.855
I'm less body weight than you, so...

992
01:28:27.934 --> 01:28:29.245
- there's algebra involved.
- So say I won.


993
01:28:29.269 --> 01:28:30.680
Why can't you say I won?

994
01:28:30.854 --> 01:28:33.319
- Say I won.
- Yeah, I bet you're a sore winner, too.


995
01:28:33.320 --> 01:28:35.602
- How much do you wanna bet?
- How much you got?


996
01:30:40.775 --> 01:30:42.698
It's called Finca Vigía.

997
01:30:43.486 --> 01:30:45.614
We can get it for next to nothing.

998
01:30:45.780 --> 01:30:47.066
We can write here together.

999
01:30:48.992 --> 01:30:51.871
What do you think? 
Isn't it perfect?

1000
01:30:55.290 --> 01:30:57.998
We'll have to give the guests machetes.

1001
01:30:59.669 --> 01:31:01.285
Who needs guests?

1002
01:31:08.887 --> 01:31:10.560
What do you think?

1003
01:31:21.357 --> 01:31:22.893
So can we stay?

1004
01:31:58.019 --> 01:32:00.010
I still can't believe it.

1005
01:32:00.897 --> 01:32:04.743
You never really know
what you're fighting for until you lose.


1006
01:32:23.044 --> 01:32:28.392
<i>After Spain,
I felt such despair for the human race.</i>


1007
01:32:29.843 --> 01:32:34.349
<i>I thought, "We're forever bitched."</i>

1008
01:32:35.598 --> 01:32:38.397
Spain. Spain really broke my heart.

1009
01:32:40.228 --> 01:32:41.844
Nobody listened.

1010
01:32:42.230 --> 01:32:43.766
<i>Nobody.</i>

1011
01:32:46.109 --> 01:32:47.941
<i>And the fascists won.</i>

1012
01:32:48.570 --> 01:32:50.186
The fascists won.

1013
01:32:51.990 --> 01:32:54.084
You listen to me, Gellhorn.

1014
01:32:57.328 --> 01:32:59.911
If he's still standing, he can fight.

1015
01:33:10.133 --> 01:33:14.138
I'm writing to show the world
what we were fighting for in Spain.


1016
01:33:36.367 --> 01:33:39.166
<i>A man can be destroyed,
but not defeated.</i>


1017
01:33:39.537 --> 01:33:43.781
<i>If he's still standing, he can fight.</i>

1018
01:34:18.451 --> 01:34:20.044
What time is it?

1019
01:34:20.870 --> 01:34:23.089
It was high noon an hour ago.

1020
01:34:23.831 --> 01:34:25.538
Writing since 6:00.

1021
01:34:26.417 --> 01:34:28.090
Come on, Gellhorn.

1022
01:34:29.003 --> 01:34:31.131
Get up and bite on the nail.

1023
01:34:32.799 --> 01:34:34.005
Go away.

1024
01:35:39.699 --> 01:35:41.747
What are you trying to do, spook me?

1025
01:35:42.076 --> 01:35:43.908
Past five minutes, 
I've watched you.

1026
01:35:44.787 --> 01:35:48.633
I've watched you type pages
and let them float into the wastebasket.


1027
01:35:55.423 --> 01:35:58.256
Any writer who rips out his stuff
and crumples it


1028
01:35:58.343 --> 01:36:01.347
will be insane in a year, guaranteed.

1029
01:36:07.226 --> 01:36:10.526
Wine, absinthe, and yet you can
get up in the morning


1030
01:36:10.605 --> 01:36:12.278
at the crack of dawn and write.

1031
01:36:12.279 --> 01:36:16.449
Writing's like mass.
God gets mad if you don't show up.


1032
01:36:16.944 --> 01:36:18.992
Come on. You don't write on Sundays.

1033
01:36:19.530 --> 01:36:21.874
Yeah, but Sundays, there's real mass.

1034
01:36:26.996 --> 01:36:29.465
Happened right after I married Pauline.

1035
01:36:30.583 --> 01:36:32.745
The moment I said, "I do,"
I was struck impotent.


1036
01:36:33.961 --> 01:36:36.635
<i>Nada. Señor</i> Linguine.

1037
01:36:37.465 --> 01:36:39.809
She had me go to church. It worked.

1038
01:36:40.134 --> 01:36:42.125
I had my very own resurrection.

1039
01:36:43.846 --> 01:36:47.635
Hell, I would have French kissed
John the Baptist for a hard-on.


1040
01:36:47.809 --> 01:36:50.483
There's an image I will cherish.

1041
01:36:50.812 --> 01:36:53.190
After that, I figured I'd stay Catholic.

1042
01:36:53.731 --> 01:36:56.314
Why jinx things? 
Hey, no snooping.

1043
01:36:56.401 --> 01:36:58.529
Come on, muses always snoop.

1044
01:37:00.154 --> 01:37:01.360
What did you...

1045
01:37:07.703 --> 01:37:11.674
"The things one comes to know about war
are not so simple."


1046
01:37:12.083 --> 01:37:13.915
That's what Koltsov said.

1047
01:37:15.002 --> 01:37:16.345
You...

1048
01:37:17.255 --> 01:37:19.997
So, this Karkov,

1049
01:37:21.509 --> 01:37:23.375
he's based on Koltsov.

1050
01:37:24.679 --> 01:37:26.773
Who knows? Could be.

1051
01:37:27.974 --> 01:37:30.386
You don't forget anything, do you?

1052
01:37:31.436 --> 01:37:32.779
Do you?

1053
01:37:32.854 --> 01:37:34.561
I forgot one thing.

1054
01:37:44.198 --> 01:37:45.450
No.

1055
01:37:53.291 --> 01:37:55.123
You're dedicating that to me?

1056
01:37:55.877 --> 01:38:00.337
Gellhorn, you inspire the hell out of me.

1057
01:38:04.719 --> 01:38:07.461
Wait, no, no, wait.
I've got to talk to you about something.


1058
01:38:07.555 --> 01:38:09.387
- Not now. Done by noon...
- But I do!


1059
01:38:09.390 --> 01:38:11.201
- ...drunk by 3:00.
- I have to talk to you about something.


1060
01:38:11.225 --> 01:38:13.148
- Wait!
- That's my philosophy.


1061
01:38:32.246 --> 01:38:33.862
God.

1062
01:38:34.707 --> 01:38:36.050
God!

1063
01:38:40.505 --> 01:38:42.098
God.

1064
01:38:48.095 --> 01:38:51.725
Life shouldn't be this perfect.
It really shouldn't.


1065
01:38:52.350 --> 01:38:54.307
It absolutely should.

1066
01:38:59.607 --> 01:39:01.280
A perfect moment.

1067
01:39:04.946 --> 01:39:06.778
But it's all still out there.

1068
01:39:07.281 --> 01:39:09.989
- What's all still out there?
- The world.


1069
01:39:13.246 --> 01:39:15.795
<i>Collier's</i> wants me to go to Finland.

1070
01:39:20.169 --> 01:39:22.547
Marty.

1071
01:39:22.630 --> 01:39:26.476
In this world, when you find a good place,
you don't leave it.


1072
01:39:27.510 --> 01:39:28.887
I know.

1073
01:39:30.680 --> 01:39:35.857
But Stalin's expanding west now,
the Russians are bombing civilians.


1074
01:39:39.063 --> 01:39:40.929
You just want a war all to yourself.

1075
01:39:41.107 --> 01:39:43.098
Well, you're the one who taught me.

1076
01:39:43.901 --> 01:39:46.814
Some wars are necessary,
and it's necessary to bear witness.


1077
01:39:46.904 --> 01:39:49.999
God damn you. I'm writing a novel here.
Aren't you happy?


1078
01:39:54.537 --> 01:39:57.666
I adore you. I...

1079
01:40:00.042 --> 01:40:02.841
I absolutely adore you.

1080
01:40:03.963 --> 01:40:06.671
But innocent people are being blown up.

1081
01:40:07.758 --> 01:40:10.170
Someone has to go.
Someone has to write about this.


1082
01:40:10.261 --> 01:40:12.514
You mean someone has to leave.

1083
01:40:13.931 --> 01:40:15.399
I want to go.

1084
01:40:16.142 --> 01:40:17.428
I do.

1085
01:40:18.269 --> 01:40:20.852
I've gotta go. 
There's things that...

1086
01:40:21.897 --> 01:40:23.695
There's things I need to find out.

1087
01:40:23.941 --> 01:40:26.353
Perkins wants you to write a novel
for Scribner's.


1088
01:40:26.360 --> 01:40:27.953
I don't want to write a novel.

1089
01:40:30.364 --> 01:40:32.856
Marty, stay here with me.

1090
01:40:34.535 --> 01:40:37.573
Happiness in intelligent people
is the rarest thing I know.


1091
01:40:41.584 --> 01:40:43.052
Marty.

1092
01:40:46.672 --> 01:40:48.288
Papa doesn't want you to go.

1093
01:40:50.760 --> 01:40:52.376
Don't "Papa" me.

1094
01:40:55.556 --> 01:40:57.422
Will you come with me?

1095
01:40:58.726 --> 01:41:00.194
Come with me.

1096
01:41:27.088 --> 01:41:30.092
<i>War in the Arctic
is a very remarkable thing.</i>


1097
01:41:42.603 --> 01:41:45.482
<i>The Finns joke that they don't believe
Russian propaganda,</i>


1098
01:41:45.483 --> 01:41:47.279
<i>but they believe Russian bombs.</i>

1099
01:41:49.568 --> 01:41:50.615
Careful!

1100
01:41:52.029 --> 01:41:55.875
<i>I saw a boy of nine, standing outside
his burning home, watching the bombers.</i>


1101
01:41:55.950 --> 01:41:59.166
<i>He looked up at the sky
with a stubborn, serious face.</i>


1102
01:41:59.167 --> 01:42:02.404
<i>He had held himself stiffly
so as not to shrink from the noise.</i>


1103
01:42:02.707 --> 01:42:06.428
<i>Then he said, "Little by little,
I'm getting really angry."</i>


1104
01:42:27.314 --> 01:42:31.410
<i>I'll put my money on three million Finns
against 180 million Russkies.</i>


1105
01:42:31.736 --> 01:42:34.865
<i>After all, they are fighting for
their lives and their homes.</i>


1106
01:42:46.250 --> 01:42:49.743
<i>My dearest Marty,
one thing you must know,</i>


1107
01:42:49.879 --> 01:42:52.883
<i>love is infinitely more durable than hate.</i>

1108
01:43:00.556 --> 01:43:02.604
<i>Maybe he has a Marty, too.</i>

1109
01:43:02.808 --> 01:43:04.856
<i>And so we howled together.</i>

1110
01:43:06.020 --> 01:43:09.479
<i>The animal, and the man whom love
has made an animal.</i>


1111
01:43:14.695 --> 01:43:16.982
<i>And make that war intelligible.</i>

1112
01:43:19.241 --> 01:43:23.030
<i>Love, you poison my typewriter.</i>

1113
01:43:28.375 --> 01:43:32.619
<i>Since you left, I've had hangovers
they could name battleships after.</i>


1114
01:43:33.631 --> 01:43:36.544
<i>Today I remember the heat
of your naked skin.</i>


1115
01:43:42.056 --> 01:43:44.605
<i>I shall be glad
to be home with you,</i>

1116
01:43:45.142 --> 01:43:46.849
<i>where I belong.</i>

1117
01:44:03.369 --> 01:44:05.952
<i>Beloved, I learned from you not
to have the vanity</i>


1118
01:44:05.955 --> 01:44:10.256
<i>to think the planes were looking for me
and all bullets had my name on them.</i>


1119
01:44:10.751 --> 01:44:13.459
<i>I'm tired, and I
wish I were with you.</i>

1120
01:44:30.437 --> 01:44:32.929
<i>I am stinko, deadly lonely.</i>

1121
01:44:35.109 --> 01:44:38.443
<i>We must promise and pledge
and swear out loud</i>


1122
01:44:38.445 --> 01:44:42.200
<i>to the love-drunk gods on high
that we will never...</i>


1123
01:44:42.366 --> 01:44:43.709
<i>And let's never...</i>

1124
01:44:43.784 --> 01:44:45.912
<i>Leave each other again.</i>

1125
01:44:46.704 --> 01:44:49.503
<i>Never leave each other again.</i>

1126
01:45:16.609 --> 01:45:17.986
You're home.

1127
01:45:23.657 --> 01:45:25.580
The maid quit.

1128
01:45:26.452 --> 01:45:28.125
I wonder why.

1129
01:45:28.287 --> 01:45:32.008
What, you go away for two months,
then waltz back and bitch?


1130
01:45:33.167 --> 01:45:34.248
Come on.

1131
01:45:36.003 --> 01:45:38.586
Got something that will make you happy.

1132
01:45:45.304 --> 01:45:46.647
You look terrible.

1133
01:45:47.056 --> 01:45:48.672
I'm fine. Now.

1134
01:45:49.850 --> 01:45:53.218
I just spent two months in the Arctic
missing you like hell,


1135
01:45:55.105 --> 01:45:56.641
They don't look like this.

1136
01:45:57.232 --> 01:45:58.518
Well, you would know.

1137
01:45:58.859 --> 01:46:01.533
- How do you write those letters?
- It's notarized.


1138
01:46:07.785 --> 01:46:09.401
My... You got a divorce.

1139
01:46:09.662 --> 01:46:11.790
Thing had to be done, I did it.

1140
01:46:12.998 --> 01:46:14.375
What about Pauline?

1141
01:46:14.625 --> 01:46:15.831
It was bad.

1142
01:46:17.378 --> 01:46:18.664
I did it for us.

1143
01:46:19.338 --> 01:46:22.012
- Us? But I didn't ask...
- So we could get married.


1144
01:46:26.095 --> 01:46:27.597
I'd rather sin respectably.

1145
01:46:27.598 --> 01:46:30.213
Well, I'd rather make
an honest woman out of you.


1146
01:46:39.149 --> 01:46:41.015
So what do you think of that?

1147
01:47:17.730 --> 01:47:19.858
<i>- Mr. Cooper, over here!</i>
- Mrs. Hemingway!


1148
01:47:19.940 --> 01:47:21.533
<i>- Hemingway!
- Mrs. Hemingway!</i>


1149
01:47:21.608 --> 01:47:22.689
Bravo, Hemingway!

1150
01:47:28.866 --> 01:47:30.732
I have never been happier.

1151
01:47:32.995 --> 01:47:36.090
Last time you said that,
you ended up in Finland.


1152
01:47:37.291 --> 01:47:38.793
What is it now?

1153
01:47:41.462 --> 01:47:42.714
What?

1154
01:47:43.338 --> 01:47:44.954
Chiang Kai Shek.

1155
01:47:45.632 --> 01:47:46.975
China!

1156
01:47:47.968 --> 01:47:50.178
<i>Collier's</i> has made me an offer.

1157
01:47:50.179 --> 01:47:53.274
Christ. Here she goes again.

1158
01:48:08.989 --> 01:48:12.357
My assignment is to show what Japan is
really doing to innocent people in China.


1159
01:48:12.367 --> 01:48:14.984
And an interview with the world's
most powerful couple.


1160
01:48:15.079 --> 01:48:17.571
- Well, that's us, isn't it?
- Come on, be serious.


1161
01:48:17.664 --> 01:48:19.166
Me be serious?

1162
01:48:20.751 --> 01:48:22.845
You love your wife, Jackson?

1163
01:48:23.003 --> 01:48:24.505
Some days.

1164
01:48:24.797 --> 01:48:26.140
Some days.

1165
01:48:28.509 --> 01:48:30.011
Man's a Plato.

1166
01:48:33.931 --> 01:48:35.729
So what do you say?

1167
01:48:39.144 --> 01:48:41.101
What do you have against China?

1168
01:48:42.189 --> 01:48:44.398
You know how filthy China is?

1169
01:48:44.399 --> 01:48:45.685
Come on.

1170
01:48:46.026 --> 01:48:47.562
You like filth.

1171
01:48:49.530 --> 01:48:51.874
Had to take out his own appendix
on horseback.


1172
01:48:51.949 --> 01:48:55.670
Forget your uncle's appendix.
No one else is covering this.


1173
01:48:55.869 --> 01:48:57.212
This could be our war.

1174
01:48:57.287 --> 01:48:59.836
Jeez. How many wars do you need?

1175
01:49:03.001 --> 01:49:06.790
Don't think of it as war.
Think of it as a paid honeymoon.


1176
01:49:07.714 --> 01:49:10.456
Our honeymoon. Come on.

1177
01:49:10.926 --> 01:49:14.385
- Don't you want a honeymoon'?
- This is our honeymoon.


1178
01:49:14.388 --> 01:49:16.800
A real honeymoon. Real.

1179
01:49:17.808 --> 01:49:20.061
- Come on, Hemingway, please?
- Marty!


1180
01:49:20.435 --> 01:49:23.143
Say yes. Please.

1181
01:49:23.230 --> 01:49:25.938
For Christ's sakes, Gellhorn.

1182
01:49:30.445 --> 01:49:32.664
Especially if she's blonde.

1183
01:49:32.739 --> 01:49:35.208
That's right. It would be very dangerous.

1184
01:49:35.534 --> 01:49:38.504
Who knows what would happen.

1185
01:49:42.291 --> 01:49:43.634
Thank you.

1186
01:49:58.515 --> 01:50:02.143
<i>And Madrid was swept almost dally
by artillery fire,</i>


1187
01:50:02.144 --> 01:50:04.693
<i>but China was in a class by itself.</i>

1188
01:50:05.105 --> 01:50:08.826
<i>As the Japanese destroyed,
the Chinese residents repaired.</i>


1189
01:50:14.698 --> 01:50:17.167
<i>And everyone else had better remember it.</i>

1190
01:50:18.285 --> 01:50:20.777
She has, a whatchamacallit, bound feet.

1191
01:50:20.871 --> 01:50:23.420
Her feet were bound and she cannot walk.

1192
01:50:28.837 --> 01:50:30.327
The Japanese
are bombing everything.


1193
01:50:31.632 --> 01:50:33.100
What is that?

1194
01:50:34.968 --> 01:50:36.800
- No...
- You must be careful.


1195
01:50:36.803 --> 01:50:38.396
No, I hear...

1196
01:50:46.271 --> 01:50:49.514
Go no further.
There is nothing we can do for him.


1197
01:50:57.282 --> 01:50:58.989
This is off-limits.

1198
01:51:00.118 --> 01:51:01.825
Are you certain you
want to go in here?

1199
01:51:01.912 --> 01:51:03.835
Yes, yes. I do, Mr. Ma.

1200
01:51:16.593 --> 01:51:18.004
Be cautious, madam.

1201
01:51:19.596 --> 01:51:20.643
No.

1202
01:51:32.901 --> 01:51:34.892
No, no, you must not use the water.

1203
01:51:34.987 --> 01:51:36.330
It's very bad. Very...

1204
01:51:36.530 --> 01:51:38.692
Come on, we're celebrating.

1205
01:51:38.865 --> 01:51:42.654
<i>For Whom the Bell Tolls</i> is selling
like ice cream in hell.


1206
01:51:43.328 --> 01:51:46.161
Clement said it's the finest book
written this decade.


1207
01:51:46.665 --> 01:51:48.884
Maybe the whole goddamn century?

1208
01:51:49.126 --> 01:51:51.174
Tell the one about Garbo's pants again.

1209
01:51:54.423 --> 01:51:56.710
- Hey, it's the Marty.
- It's very bad.


1210
01:51:56.925 --> 01:51:58.848
She washed her hands with the water.

1211
01:51:59.177 --> 01:52:00.588
She what?

1212
01:52:02.931 --> 01:52:04.399
You must want to suffer.

1213
01:52:04.725 --> 01:52:06.944
I must. I'm in love with you.

1214
01:52:09.021 --> 01:52:11.991
We must hurry, please.
I have gotten you a whatchamacallit,


1215
01:52:12.065 --> 01:52:14.614
an interview with
Generalissimo Chiang Kai Shek.


1216
01:52:21.783 --> 01:52:25.629
Madame Chiang, you look even better
than you do on the cover of <i>Time</i>.


1217
01:52:35.922 --> 01:52:40.519
The Generalissimo wishes to tell you
communism is a disease of the heart.


1218
01:52:41.261 --> 01:52:43.969
The Japanese are a disease of the skin.

1219
01:52:46.683 --> 01:52:51.223
Yes, the communists hamper our army
against the Japanese invaders.


1220
01:52:51.688 --> 01:52:53.609
You must tell your friend, Roosevelt.

1221
01:52:53.610 --> 01:52:55.348
We will. You can count on it.

1222
01:52:55.442 --> 01:52:58.662
You must also tell him not to worry
about Mao or Zhou Enlai.


1223
01:53:00.614 --> 01:53:02.571
These are the communist leaders.

1224
01:53:05.619 --> 01:53:07.610
So-called leaders, of course.

1225
01:53:08.121 --> 01:53:12.126
No one can replace the Generalissimo
in the hearts of his people.


1226
01:53:21.134 --> 01:53:22.636
Does it really matter?

1227
01:53:29.643 --> 01:53:31.475
I mean, the people...

1228
01:53:33.313 --> 01:53:35.782
The people are starving.

1229
01:53:40.612 --> 01:53:41.659
I...

1230
01:53:41.822 --> 01:53:45.156
I met a little girl in an opium den today,
and she was...


1231
01:53:50.872 --> 01:53:53.671
Perhaps you enjoy opium?

1232
01:53:55.669 --> 01:53:58.161
No. I never touch the stuff.

1233
01:54:00.215 --> 01:54:01.751
But I can see why your people do.

1234
01:54:05.220 --> 01:54:08.383
Your opinions are so interesting.

1235
01:54:09.349 --> 01:54:12.842
But I believe that we know
what is best for our own people.


1236
01:54:13.019 --> 01:54:14.191
Chocolate?

1237
01:54:15.689 --> 01:54:17.100
No, thank you.

1238
01:54:17.190 --> 01:54:20.820
So is it best for children
to be working in squalor?


1239
01:54:21.027 --> 01:54:24.452
And it's best for lepers
to be on the street, begging?


1240
01:54:24.531 --> 01:54:26.943
That's so interesting.

1241
01:54:27.033 --> 01:54:28.148
If not civilized.

1242
01:54:28.326 --> 01:54:29.828
Civilized?

1243
01:54:34.291 --> 01:54:35.884
She certainly does.

1244
01:54:36.084 --> 01:54:38.419
China was a great civilization

1245
01:54:38.420 --> 01:54:41.003
when your ancestors were living in trees

1246
01:54:41.548 --> 01:54:43.539
and painting themselves blue.

1247
01:54:43.675 --> 01:54:45.666
Which ancestors are they?

1248
01:54:46.470 --> 01:54:48.211
Apes or Gellhorns?

1249
01:54:50.807 --> 01:54:51.888
You will have this.

1250
01:54:52.350 --> 01:54:54.057
No, I couldn't take it.

1251
01:54:54.144 --> 01:54:55.555
I insist.

1252
01:54:57.105 --> 01:54:59.938
Well, thank you, it's lovely.

1253
01:55:00.317 --> 01:55:03.560
You see, we're not so uncivilized.

1254
01:55:06.072 --> 01:55:09.076
Some balls, Gellhorn,
telling off the Empress of China


1255
01:55:09.077 --> 01:55:10.782
in front of Chiang Kai Shek.

1256
01:55:10.785 --> 01:55:12.651
You don't think they'll invite us back?

1257
01:55:12.746 --> 01:55:14.794
We'll be lucky if they don't hang us.

1258
01:55:14.873 --> 01:55:16.466
What the hell got into you'?

1259
01:55:16.917 --> 01:55:20.285
I just keep seeing that little girl
in the opium den.


1260
01:55:20.420 --> 01:55:21.922
It upsets me.

1261
01:55:22.464 --> 01:55:24.592
They don't take care of their people.

1262
01:55:24.674 --> 01:55:26.085
I need some calamine.

1263
01:55:26.176 --> 01:55:28.008
My hands, they're just...

1264
01:55:28.094 --> 01:55:30.140
You must stop scratching. 
It's very bad.

1265
01:55:30.141 --> 01:55:31.936
You have the whatchamacallit?

1266
01:55:32.015 --> 01:55:33.933
What's whatchamacallit?

1267
01:55:33.934 --> 01:55:35.106
China rot.

1268
01:55:35.185 --> 01:55:36.232
Too late for calamine.

1269
01:55:36.353 --> 01:55:37.730
You need...

1270
01:55:38.313 --> 01:55:40.020
You need some of this...

1271
01:55:40.106 --> 01:55:41.278
No, no, no. What is that?

1272
01:55:41.775 --> 01:55:44.267
Snake urine and bat whatchamacallit...

1273
01:55:45.737 --> 01:55:47.080
- Come on.
- Yes.


1274
01:55:47.155 --> 01:55:48.748
This will work.

1275
01:55:48.823 --> 01:55:50.359
Stop scratching. Put this on.

1276
01:55:50.450 --> 01:55:51.622
Right away.

1277
01:55:54.579 --> 01:55:55.694
There you go.

1278
01:56:08.301 --> 01:56:09.974
Now, you need some gloves.

1279
01:56:11.096 --> 01:56:12.507
Here.

1280
01:56:13.515 --> 01:56:15.256
These are the best.

1281
01:56:16.768 --> 01:56:18.441
Motorman's gloves.

1282
01:56:18.937 --> 01:56:20.405
Enjoying your honeymoon?

1283
01:56:20.480 --> 01:56:22.858
- Go to hell.
- Already there, dear.


1284
01:56:23.149 --> 01:56:25.982
Should we go and scare up
some of that snake hooch?


1285
01:56:25.986 --> 01:56:27.329
Yes, sir.

1286
01:56:29.656 --> 01:56:30.656
Gellhorn.

1287
01:56:32.033 --> 01:56:34.502
Zhou Enlai wants to meet
you and Hemingway.


1288
01:56:34.503 --> 01:56:36.542
Make sure you're not followed.

1289
01:56:36.997 --> 01:56:38.829
Just walk. We'll find you.

1290
01:56:39.207 --> 01:56:40.584
But hurry.

1291
01:56:44.588 --> 01:56:46.380
You see that woman?

1292
01:56:46.381 --> 01:56:47.428
What woman?

1293
01:56:47.507 --> 01:56:49.669
Damn it, she disappeared. She...

1294
01:56:51.845 --> 01:56:53.051
Who is he again?

1295
01:56:56.600 --> 01:56:58.193
Which means she is worried.

1296
01:56:58.268 --> 01:57:00.009
I like him already.

1297
01:57:01.980 --> 01:57:03.687
We'll have to ditch you know who.

1298
01:57:03.773 --> 01:57:04.979
Mr. Ma?

1299
01:57:06.651 --> 01:57:09.621
She said to just keep walking
and they will find us.


1300
01:57:23.376 --> 01:57:24.376
Quick.

1301
01:57:24.461 --> 01:57:25.542
Come.

1302
01:57:29.507 --> 01:57:30.850
Please. Get in.

1303
01:57:31.051 --> 01:57:32.519
Put these blindfolds on.

1304
01:57:32.594 --> 01:57:34.551
Why the hell Will we do that?

1305
01:57:34.554 --> 01:57:35.760
Zhou has many enemies.

1306
01:57:35.847 --> 01:57:37.838
Better you don't know how to find him.

1307
01:57:38.141 --> 01:57:39.882
Well, this should be fun.

1308
01:57:50.737 --> 01:57:52.273
How fast can they pull these things?

1309
01:57:52.405 --> 01:57:53.998
Depends who's chasing them.

1310
01:58:15.136 --> 01:58:17.935
This is
some fucking honeymoon, Gellhorn.


1311
01:58:29.734 --> 01:58:32.021
It means there's cholera there.

1312
01:58:32.320 --> 01:58:33.572
Cholera?

1313
01:58:34.155 --> 01:58:35.953
We're headed ashore.

1314
01:58:44.541 --> 01:58:47.704
<i>A line of men,
like dark, straining statues,</i>


1315
01:58:47.794 --> 01:58:50.468
<i>pulled the towrope with their sampan</i>

1316
01:58:53.508 --> 01:58:55.636
<i>They chanted to time their effort.</i>

1317
01:58:55.802 --> 01:59:00.467
<i>And the sound came as a rising
and falling wave across the water.</i>


1318
01:59:06.646 --> 01:59:08.637
<i>You may remove the blindfolds.</i>

1319
01:59:10.275 --> 01:59:11.275
I'm Zhou.

1320
01:59:11.985 --> 01:59:13.453
Zhou Enlai.

1321
01:59:19.075 --> 01:59:20.190
Hello, Zhou.

1322
01:59:20.201 --> 01:59:21.999
- I'm Gellhorn.
- Hemingway.


1323
01:59:22.120 --> 01:59:23.167
A drink.

1324
01:59:23.747 --> 01:59:25.841
To Hemingway and Gellhorn.

1325
01:59:32.672 --> 01:59:34.834
I believe where you come from,
it is called moonshine.


1326
01:59:35.216 --> 01:59:37.594
Where I come from, it's called gasoline.

1327
01:59:41.681 --> 01:59:43.900
I admired <i>A Farewell to Arms.</i>

1328
01:59:45.185 --> 01:59:48.610
You understand the real heart of war.

1329
01:59:49.481 --> 01:59:50.596
The movie, however...

1330
01:59:50.690 --> 01:59:52.784
- You saw the movie?
- Yes.


1331
01:59:53.485 --> 01:59:55.068
But I'm sorry.

1332
01:59:55.069 --> 01:59:57.356
Helen Hayes was not Catherine Barkley.

1333
02:00:00.033 --> 02:00:01.444
Don't blame me. Okay?

1334
02:00:01.534 --> 02:00:02.786
When it comes to Hollywood,

1335
02:00:02.869 --> 02:00:05.452
I drive to the border,
toss the book over with one hand,


1336
02:00:05.538 --> 02:00:07.370
then grab the cash with the other.

1337
02:00:07.373 --> 02:00:08.784
Sounds very glamorous.

1338
02:00:08.875 --> 02:00:11.253
Not as glamorous as
an underground communist leader


1339
02:00:11.254 --> 02:00:12.754
up against the Generalissimo.

1340
02:00:12.837 --> 02:00:14.373
Yes.

1341
02:00:15.548 --> 02:00:17.710
I live simply

1342
02:00:17.801 --> 02:00:19.633
'cause my people live simply.

1343
02:00:19.761 --> 02:00:21.718
Most of us do not have chocolates.

1344
02:00:22.222 --> 02:00:25.806
It's not often Chiang removes
his teeth for guests.


1345
02:00:26.059 --> 02:00:27.891
You have excellent intelligence.

1346
02:00:28.061 --> 02:00:31.520
Gellhorn. I see you have one
of Madame's jade brooches.


1347
02:00:32.148 --> 02:00:34.697
She was very insistent.

1348
02:00:35.276 --> 02:00:38.109
Did she mention they are made
by blind children?


1349
02:00:38.112 --> 02:00:39.728
The Chiangs own the factory.

1350
02:00:41.991 --> 02:00:44.904
My wife thinks that
Madame had Chiang castrated.


1351
02:00:45.411 --> 02:00:47.209
Your wife knows a lot about castration?

1352
02:00:47.622 --> 02:00:49.238
Wouldn't surprise me.

1353
02:00:49.332 --> 02:00:51.676
Castration is an elective at Bryn Mawr.

1354
02:00:53.837 --> 02:00:57.421
My friends in America tell me
you know Eleanor Roosevelt.


1355
02:00:57.632 --> 02:00:59.009
Quite well.

1356
02:00:59.092 --> 02:01:00.173
Brilliant woman.

1357
02:01:00.260 --> 02:01:02.932
Inform her the Generalissimo is the past.

1358
02:01:02.933 --> 02:01:05.148
A communist victory is inevitable.

1359
02:01:11.688 --> 02:01:14.180
I wish we had more time to talk,

1360
02:01:18.736 --> 02:01:19.851
Take care.

1361
02:01:20.613 --> 02:01:22.866
So, how do we get back from here?

1362
02:01:26.411 --> 02:01:27.458
Mr. Ma.

1363
02:01:29.956 --> 02:01:31.333
So, whose side are you on?

1364
02:01:31.416 --> 02:01:32.793
There are no sides.

1365
02:01:33.293 --> 02:01:35.671
There's only the past and the future.

1366
02:01:36.296 --> 02:01:38.003
Now, you must wait here.

1367
02:01:38.006 --> 02:01:40.418
When it is safe, we
will come to get you.

1368
02:01:55.481 --> 02:01:57.074
Zhou's a winner, don't you think?

1369
02:01:57.150 --> 02:01:58.982
He's entrancing.

1370
02:01:58.985 --> 02:02:00.851
I mean, he's...

1371
02:02:01.446 --> 02:02:02.527
I mean...

1372
02:02:03.031 --> 02:02:04.533
intoxicating.

1373
02:02:05.199 --> 02:02:07.816
I mean, if he
asked me to follow him,

1374
02:02:08.119 --> 02:02:09.371
I would follow him...

1375
02:02:09.495 --> 02:02:11.589
What, you sit here
on our so-called honeymoon


1376
02:02:11.664 --> 02:02:14.213
and tell me you want
to run off with Zhou fucking Enlai?


1377
02:02:15.835 --> 02:02:17.325
I thought you liked him.

1378
02:02:17.337 --> 02:02:18.839
I like a lot of guys.

1379
02:02:20.632 --> 02:02:21.747
I was just musing.

1380
02:02:21.841 --> 02:02:25.471
Musing? A wife doesn't muse
about fucking other men.


1381
02:02:25.553 --> 02:02:26.553
Fucking?

1382
02:02:26.679 --> 02:02:28.841
Who was ever talking about fucking'?

1383
02:02:29.015 --> 02:02:31.723
I'm talking about a charismatic leader,
someone who's intoxicating.


1384
02:02:33.436 --> 02:02:35.359
Well, why do you have
to make it about fucking'?


1385
02:02:40.652 --> 02:02:41.858
Fucking?

1386
02:02:42.362 --> 02:02:44.035
I don't want to fuck him.

1387
02:02:45.782 --> 02:02:48.194
I'd love to interview the person
who made this stuff.


1388
02:02:48.201 --> 02:02:50.192
Little Miss Human Interest.

1389
02:02:50.328 --> 02:02:52.194
Don't you want to be careful,

1390
02:02:52.288 --> 02:02:55.711
or you might lose the sweep of history
with all your people stories.


1391
02:02:55.712 --> 02:02:58.200
History is people.
You should get out of the bar more.


1392
02:02:58.211 --> 02:03:00.623
I like bars, I met you in one.

1393
02:03:00.713 --> 02:03:03.205
Well, I like to get my stories firsthand.

1394
02:03:03.341 --> 02:03:05.594
Well, this one you got on both hands.

1395
02:03:08.721 --> 02:03:10.849
Zhou fucking Enlai.

1396
02:03:16.729 --> 02:03:19.733
<i>It had been
scandalous selfishness on my part.</i>


1397
02:03:20.358 --> 02:03:22.315
<i>In that moment, 
I wanted to praise him</i>

1398
02:03:22.402 --> 02:03:25.702
<i>For his generosity and letting me
drag him to China.</i>


1399
02:03:27.240 --> 02:03:29.982
<i>His forbearance for not murdering me,</i>

1400
02:03:31.619 --> 02:03:33.576
<i>even his awful jokes.</i>

1401
02:03:34.455 --> 02:03:37.334
<i>I wanted to let him know that
I grieved for his time wasted</i>


1402
02:03:37.417 --> 02:03:39.158
<i>on a season in hell</i>

1403
02:03:40.795 --> 02:03:43.287
- Thank you...
- Take your filthy hands off me!


1404
02:03:43.297 --> 02:03:45.425
You're the biggest asshole!

1405
02:03:49.053 --> 02:03:50.305
You are!

1406
02:04:06.487 --> 02:04:07.955
Where are we?

1407
02:04:08.781 --> 02:04:10.454
In a fucking cave.

1408
02:04:12.076 --> 02:04:13.783
Somewhere in China.

1409
02:04:21.377 --> 02:04:22.754
We told Mrs. Roosevelt

1410
02:04:23.337 --> 02:04:26.671
<i>all that we had seen,
and she was very sympathetic.</i>


1411
02:04:31.137 --> 02:04:32.514
<i>We spoke to the State Department.</i>

1412
02:04:32.597 --> 02:04:35.214
<i>We said Zhou Enlai
was the man to watch.</i>

1413
02:04:35.308 --> 02:04:37.925
We told them the communists would win.

1414
02:04:38.603 --> 02:04:40.520
Imagine that.

1415
02:04:40.521 --> 02:04:42.137
Communist China.

1416
02:04:42.356 --> 02:04:43.642
For that,

1417
02:04:44.108 --> 02:04:46.486
we were branded fellow travelers.

1418
02:04:49.322 --> 02:04:50.528
I thought it was funny.

1419
02:04:51.324 --> 02:04:53.031
<i>But Hem didn't like it.</i>

1420
02:04:53.576 --> 02:04:56.819
<i>He didn't want the government thinking
he was a pinko.</i>


1421
02:04:59.499 --> 02:05:01.911
<i>I believe it made him extra patriotic.</i>

1422
02:05:02.960 --> 02:05:04.371
Right On target.

1423
02:05:08.883 --> 02:05:10.169
<i>He stopped writing,</i>

1424
02:05:10.176 --> 02:05:13.897
<i>and he spent all of his time
with his cronies on the</i> Pilar,


1425
02:05:13.971 --> 02:05:15.644
<i>hunting for U-boats.</i>

1426
02:05:19.977 --> 02:05:23.072
<i>People say that jealousy
is the greatest enemy of love.</i>


1427
02:05:23.147 --> 02:05:24.512
<i>They're wrong.</i>

1428
02:05:24.524 --> 02:05:26.231
<i>The greatest enemy of love</i>

1429
02:05:26.901 --> 02:05:28.312
<i>is boredom.</i>

1430
02:05:29.403 --> 02:05:31.076
Colebaugh. It's Gellhorn.

1431
02:05:31.155 --> 02:05:33.203
<i>I wanted to be
where the real action was.</i>

1432
02:05:33.282 --> 02:05:35.094
Why do you think?
There's going to be an invasion in Europe.


1433
02:05:35.118 --> 02:05:36.734
I want to cover it for <i>Collier's</i>.

1434
02:05:38.412 --> 02:05:40.278
That's Hem and his buddies playing war.

1435
02:05:40.456 --> 02:05:43.369
They managed to get the <i>Pilar</i>
designated an official Q-boat


1436
02:05:43.626 --> 02:05:46.038
for destroying German submarines.

1437
02:05:54.178 --> 02:05:56.101
Because it's ludicrous.

1438
02:05:56.180 --> 02:05:57.557
That's why.

1439
02:05:58.182 --> 02:06:01.095
In six months, he hasn't found so much
as a floating sauerbraten.


1440
02:06:04.564 --> 02:06:06.237
That's a damn cat.

1441
02:06:06.732 --> 02:06:09.076
They multiply hourly down here.

1442
02:06:10.987 --> 02:06:14.230
I know how the army feels
about female correspondents,


1443
02:06:14.949 --> 02:06:16.417
but, I mean, come on.

1444
02:06:16.617 --> 02:06:17.960
I'm battle-tested.

1445
02:06:18.035 --> 02:06:19.035
I'm different.

1446
02:06:21.247 --> 02:06:22.715
Come on, Charlie.

1447
02:06:23.082 --> 02:06:24.618
You got to help me out here.

1448
02:06:26.836 --> 02:06:30.625
But you told me that <i>Collier's</i>
loves my stuff on Finland and China.


1449
02:06:31.841 --> 02:06:33.764
You'll get back to me?

1450
02:06:36.929 --> 02:06:38.044
Damn.

1451
02:06:44.854 --> 02:06:47.107
- You had their balls cut off?
- I did.


1452
02:06:47.108 --> 02:06:49.814
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- What? Me?


1453
02:06:49.901 --> 02:06:51.753
- Wait a second. Whose balls got cut off?
- The cats.


1454
02:06:51.777 --> 02:06:53.267
She had them de-<i>cojone</i>-d!

1455
02:06:53.279 --> 02:06:55.145
No! What'll they do at night?

1456
02:06:55.239 --> 02:06:57.617
One thing they're not going to do
is spray my clothes.


1457
02:06:57.742 --> 02:06:59.210
Everything I own stinks!

1458
02:06:59.285 --> 02:07:00.491
Stinks of cat stink!

1459
02:07:00.620 --> 02:07:01.997
You're obsessive, you know that?

1460
02:07:01.998 --> 02:07:03.862
You're obsessive about being filthy!

1461
02:07:03.998 --> 02:07:05.671
Yeah, well, men aren't tulips!

1462
02:07:05.791 --> 02:07:07.782
Please. A grown man playing war'?

1463
02:07:07.919 --> 02:07:09.626
Nobody here is playing.

1464
02:07:09.754 --> 02:07:12.553
Felipe here can throw a grenade
down the hatch of a sub


1465
02:07:12.632 --> 02:07:14.248
the second they open up.

1466
02:07:21.474 --> 02:07:23.147
For God's sake, Hem.

1467
02:07:23.267 --> 02:07:25.185
German submarines in Cuba?

1468
02:07:25.186 --> 02:07:26.927
You wouldn't put that in a bad novel.

1469
02:07:28.231 --> 02:07:30.029
What novel are you calling bad'?

1470
02:07:30.107 --> 02:07:31.848
- Here we go.
- For your information,


1471
02:07:31.859 --> 02:07:34.692
not a single U-boat has made it through.

1472
02:07:34.695 --> 02:07:35.867
Fine. Fine.

1473
02:07:35.947 --> 02:07:37.688
You keep America safe for democracy.

1474
02:07:37.698 --> 02:07:39.109
I am going.

1475
02:07:39.784 --> 02:07:41.832
That woman loves humanity,

1476
02:07:41.911 --> 02:07:43.834
but can't stand people!

1477
02:07:44.330 --> 02:07:46.196
I always said that, didn't I?

1478
02:07:46.332 --> 02:07:47.925
- You did.
- I did.


1479
02:07:48.834 --> 02:07:50.120
Gellhorn!

1480
02:07:50.670 --> 02:07:52.536
Papa, forget about her!

1481
02:07:52.713 --> 02:07:54.181
- Gellhorn!
- Papa!


1482
02:07:54.590 --> 02:07:55.710
Don't you walk away from me!

1483
02:07:55.800 --> 02:07:57.666
You berated me in front of your friends.

1484
02:07:57.760 --> 02:07:59.751
You've become a braggart,
and it's not attractive.


1485
02:07:59.845 --> 02:08:01.347
What the hell do you need from me?

1486
02:08:01.430 --> 02:08:04.047
I don't need anything from you!
There's going to be an Allied invasion.


1487
02:08:04.058 --> 02:08:05.401
- I need to be there.
- That's right.


1488
02:08:05.402 --> 02:08:07.066
Run off whenever there's a cause.

1489
02:08:09.563 --> 02:08:11.031
What happened to your conscience?

1490
02:08:13.359 --> 02:08:14.611
I'm so inspired.

1491
02:08:14.694 --> 02:08:17.362
I'm going to be
flying over in a week.

1492
02:08:17.363 --> 02:08:19.411
I have secured a position.

1493
02:08:21.117 --> 02:08:22.528
Well, that's fantastic.

1494
02:08:23.244 --> 02:08:24.860
So we're going together.

1495
02:08:27.456 --> 02:08:28.456
What?

1496
02:08:31.377 --> 02:08:32.492
What?

1497
02:08:32.920 --> 02:08:34.877
- What is it?
- Congratulate me, darling.


1498
02:08:36.007 --> 02:08:40.217
I'm going to be
the correspondent for <i>Collier's</i>.


1499
02:08:43.389 --> 02:08:44.891
For <i>Collier's?</i>

1500
02:08:46.976 --> 02:08:49.104
No, come on. This is a joke. You...

1501
02:08:49.228 --> 02:08:51.356
You know they can only take
one correspondent.


1502
02:08:52.231 --> 02:08:53.938
It's dog-eat-dog out there.

1503
02:08:56.193 --> 02:08:57.570
Oh, my God.

1504
02:08:58.446 --> 02:09:00.244
You could have signed anywhere.

1505
02:09:00.990 --> 02:09:02.583
You took my job.

1506
02:09:03.159 --> 02:09:05.571
You took my job <i>at Collier's?</i>

1507
02:09:05.578 --> 02:09:07.444
I know. I got
some hefty shoes to fill.

1508
02:09:07.538 --> 02:09:09.529
You've done some excellent work.

1509
02:09:16.756 --> 02:09:18.463
Come on, sport.
I could be killed over there.


1510
02:09:18.466 --> 02:09:20.594
That'd make you happy, wouldn't it'?

1511
02:09:22.762 --> 02:09:24.105
I don't even...

1512
02:09:25.765 --> 02:09:27.597
You asshole!

1513
02:09:31.937 --> 02:09:33.109
Jesus.

1514
02:09:41.113 --> 02:09:42.285
This is...

1515
02:09:45.910 --> 02:09:47.196
So, how are you flying over?

1516
02:09:47.286 --> 02:09:49.778
- Government transport.
- Really? Okay.


1517
02:09:49.872 --> 02:09:52.455
Get me a seat on the plane.
It's the least you could do.


1518
02:09:52.458 --> 02:09:53.664
No can do.

1519
02:09:53.667 --> 02:09:55.408
Men only. Military.

1520
02:09:57.630 --> 02:09:58.677
Why?

1521
02:10:01.467 --> 02:10:02.719
Hem, why?

1522
02:10:09.600 --> 02:10:11.557
So Dos Passos was right.

1523
02:10:11.894 --> 02:10:13.635
What was that priss ever right about?

1524
02:10:14.021 --> 02:10:15.694
About you, mostly.

1525
02:10:16.190 --> 02:10:19.353
He said you were a self-serving,
selfish bastard.


1526
02:10:30.996 --> 02:10:33.738
- You didn't need to do that.
- Yes, I did.


1527
02:10:36.001 --> 02:10:37.617
You know a hell of a lot,

1528
02:10:38.462 --> 02:10:41.762
but what you don't know
is how much I did need to do that.


1529
02:10:52.977 --> 02:10:54.183
You get back here.

1530
02:10:54.186 --> 02:10:55.520
Fuck you.

1531
02:10:55.521 --> 02:10:56.521
Gellhorn!

1532
02:10:57.398 --> 02:10:58.398
Gellhorn!

1533
02:10:58.482 --> 02:11:00.701
God.

1534
02:11:00.860 --> 02:11:02.692
Waste of time.

1535
02:11:05.114 --> 02:11:09.540
They'll still be reading me
long after you've been eaten by worms!


1536
02:11:12.746 --> 02:11:14.032
FUCK you!

1537
02:11:16.459 --> 02:11:17.995
Eaten by worms!

1538
02:11:27.386 --> 02:11:29.878
<i>And my problem, with no connections,</i>

1539
02:11:31.182 --> 02:11:33.856
<i>was how to be there when it did.</i>

1540
02:11:40.191 --> 02:11:41.727
Good luck, blondie. Go.

1541
02:11:52.786 --> 02:11:54.402
<i>So I stowed away</i>

1542
02:11:55.080 --> 02:11:56.821
<i>on a hospital ship.</i>

1543
02:11:58.417 --> 02:12:01.125
<i>People will be writing about this sight
for 100 years,</i>


1544
02:12:01.212 --> 02:12:03.260
<i>and whoever saw it will never forget it.</i>

1545
02:12:05.549 --> 02:12:08.098
<i>After the first shock of wonder
and admiration,</i>


1546
02:12:08.177 --> 02:12:11.272
<i>one began to look around
and see separate details.</i>


1547
02:12:11.764 --> 02:12:14.142
<i>A gun flash, a distant war.</i>

1548
02:12:14.600 --> 02:12:16.267
<i>Barrage balloons,</i>

1549
02:12:16.268 --> 02:12:19.636
<i>like comic toy elephants,
bounced in the high wind.</i>


1550
02:12:20.272 --> 02:12:24.448
<i>And invisible planes droned
behind the gray ceiling of cloud.</i>


1551
02:12:38.958 --> 02:12:40.881
<i>Troops were unloading
from big ships.</i>


1552
02:12:41.627 --> 02:12:45.871
<i>On the shore, moving up four brown roads
that scarred the hillside are tanks</i>


1553
02:12:45.965 --> 02:12:48.514
<i>clanked slowly and steadily forward.</i>

1554
02:12:49.051 --> 02:12:52.772
<i>We waded ashore having agreed
that we would assemble the wounded.</i>


1555
02:12:55.808 --> 02:12:59.529
<i>Everyone was violently busy
on that crowded, dangerous shore.</i>


1556
02:12:59.530 --> 02:13:03.400
<i>The dust that rose
seemed like the fog of war itself.</i>


1557
02:13:04.316 --> 02:13:07.286
<i>There was the terrible feeling
of working against time.</i>


1558
02:13:09.154 --> 02:13:12.875
<i>There were wounded who groaned
in their sleep or called out.</i>


1559
02:13:14.076 --> 02:13:18.377
"And there was the soft steady hum
of conversation among the wounded"


1560
02:13:18.455 --> 02:13:20.196
"who could not sleep."

1561
02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:22.081
"Stop."

1562
02:13:23.252 --> 02:13:26.165
"It was a ship
carrying a load of pain."

1563
02:13:26.422 --> 02:13:28.038
"But we were together."

1564
02:13:28.424 --> 02:13:30.256
"And we counted on each other."

1565
02:13:30.843 --> 02:13:32.015
"Stop."

1566
02:13:41.854 --> 02:13:43.561
Ernest, are you all right'?

1567
02:13:45.190 --> 02:13:47.022
Yeah, of course I'm okay.

1568
02:13:52.489 --> 02:13:54.708
What did you say your name was again?

1569
02:13:56.452 --> 02:13:57.533
Mary.

1570
02:13:58.495 --> 02:13:59.542
Mary Welsh.

1571
02:14:00.080 --> 02:14:02.208
I can tell you're my kind of girl.

1572
02:14:03.208 --> 02:14:04.881
What kind of girl is that?

1573
02:14:05.169 --> 02:14:07.263
The kind that takes care of a man.

1574
02:14:08.047 --> 02:14:09.333
Looks after him.

1575
02:14:10.549 --> 02:14:11.835
Keeps him going.

1576
02:14:12.801 --> 02:14:13.801
I like that.

1577
02:14:15.262 --> 02:14:16.429
I could do that.

1578
02:14:16.430 --> 02:14:17.545
Yeah?

1579
02:14:32.279 --> 02:14:33.781
That's lovely.

1580
02:14:33.906 --> 02:14:35.408
It's Italian, isn't it?

1581
02:15:09.942 --> 02:15:11.444
Mrs. Hemingway!

1582
02:15:16.699 --> 02:15:18.235
Mrs. Hemingway?

1583
02:15:18.367 --> 02:15:19.903
Mrs. Hemingway!

1584
02:15:21.286 --> 02:15:23.027
Are you Mrs. Ernest Hemingway?

1585
02:15:24.873 --> 02:15:25.988
Why?

1586
02:15:27.876 --> 02:15:32.803
And that, children, is the best way
to handle a knife-wielding Chinese!


1587
02:15:38.470 --> 02:15:40.336
Ernest is a great storyteller.

1588
02:15:44.476 --> 02:15:46.604
My God. It's the Marty.

1589
02:15:50.441 --> 02:15:53.149
First journalist on the beach at Normandy.

1590
02:15:54.069 --> 02:15:55.901
Though
she's not really accredited.


1591
02:15:59.908 --> 02:16:02.195
No home and hearth for my wife.

1592
02:16:02.494 --> 02:16:05.828
She'd rather be married to war,
isn't that right, <i>Intrepid</i>?


1593
02:16:06.957 --> 02:16:08.243
I heard you had an accident.

1594
02:16:10.878 --> 02:16:12.050
A scratch.

1595
02:16:13.130 --> 02:16:15.178
Obviously hasn't affected your personality.

1596
02:16:21.805 --> 02:16:23.307
<i>I</i> don't know.

1597
02:16:32.399 --> 02:16:33.571
I guess...

1598
02:16:35.861 --> 02:16:37.534
Guess I just came by for a divorce.

1599
02:16:46.038 --> 02:16:47.210
Marty.

1600
02:16:49.833 --> 02:16:51.881
- Papa, what are you doing?
- Marty!


1601
02:16:53.128 --> 02:16:54.608
Look what that bitch has done to him.

1602
02:16:55.714 --> 02:16:56.886
Marty!

1603
02:16:59.301 --> 02:17:00.553
Gellhorn!

1604
02:17:02.763 --> 02:17:04.561
Sir, you're bleeding.

1605
02:17:10.229 --> 02:17:11.515
Gellhorn!

1606
02:17:17.986 --> 02:17:19.522
Marty, it's me.

1607
02:17:20.823 --> 02:17:21.904
Go away.

1608
02:17:23.700 --> 02:17:24.745
Marty, open the door.

1609
02:17:24.746 --> 02:17:25.915
No, I'm not letting you in.

1610
02:17:25.994 --> 02:17:27.735
You're plastered. Go away.

1611
02:17:28.455 --> 02:17:29.570
Marty!

1612
02:17:31.083 --> 02:17:32.551
I told you I want a divorce.

1613
02:17:34.253 --> 02:17:36.295
Open up, Mrs. Hemingway.

1614
02:17:36.296 --> 02:17:38.424
Mr. Hemingway loves you.

1615
02:17:47.391 --> 02:17:49.007
My God. Look at you.

1616
02:17:52.521 --> 02:17:54.114
You're the queen of heaven.

1617
02:17:54.773 --> 02:17:56.275
It's too late.

1618
02:17:56.400 --> 02:17:57.447
No.

1619
02:17:58.944 --> 02:18:00.116
Marty.

1620
02:18:00.988 --> 02:18:02.103
Give me a chance.

1621
02:18:04.491 --> 02:18:06.232
I deserve a chance.

1622
02:18:08.370 --> 02:18:09.622
Come on.

1623
02:18:10.205 --> 02:18:13.448
If we get divorced in Cuba,
then we don't have to wait.


1624
02:18:15.961 --> 02:18:18.248
Always up on the local customs.

1625
02:18:22.926 --> 02:18:24.132
Fucking journalist.

1626
02:18:26.179 --> 02:18:27.681
Fucking bitch!

1627
02:18:28.557 --> 02:18:30.423
I gave you everything!

1628
02:18:31.143 --> 02:18:32.395
Gellhorn!

1629
02:18:33.145 --> 02:18:34.488
I made you!

1630
02:18:35.814 --> 02:18:37.191
I made you!

1631
02:18:53.290 --> 02:18:55.338
It's over. It's enough!

1632
02:19:00.547 --> 02:19:01.799
Go away.

1633
02:19:03.258 --> 02:19:04.794
Please go away.

1634
02:19:05.594 --> 02:19:06.800
Bitch.

1635
02:19:12.893 --> 02:19:13.974
God.

1636
02:19:18.023 --> 02:19:19.616
<i>We were good in war.</i>

1637
02:19:21.193 --> 02:19:23.287
<i>And when there was no war,</i>

1638
02:19:23.362 --> 02:19:24.955
<i>we made our own.</i>

1639
02:19:26.031 --> 02:19:30.207
<i>The battlefield neither of us could survive
was domestic life.</i>


1640
02:19:36.291 --> 02:19:37.759
<i>I try not to think about him</i>

1641
02:19:37.834 --> 02:19:40.804
<i>since I fear I cannot think about him
with kindness,</i>


1642
02:19:40.879 --> 02:19:42.620
<i>but only with dread.</i>

1643
02:19:45.217 --> 02:19:48.221
<i>God, how I hope the problems
of my own tiny life don't</i>


1644
02:19:48.222 --> 02:19:50.143
<i>blind me to everything.</i>

1645
02:20:01.650 --> 02:20:04.483
<i>There were two things
that most affected my view of the world.</i>


1646
02:20:04.569 --> 02:20:05.569
<i>One.</i>

1647
02:20:06.446 --> 02:20:08.574
One was the defeat of Spain.

1648
02:20:09.449 --> 02:20:10.917
And the other...

1649
02:20:16.999 --> 02:20:18.535
...was Dachau.

1650
02:20:22.963 --> 02:20:25.796
<i>And Dachau was minor
compared to Auschwitz.</i>


1651
02:20:25.924 --> 02:20:27.915
<i>It was an unbelievable horror.</i>

1652
02:20:28.260 --> 02:20:32.504
<i>A thing so horrendous
that you could not take it all in</i>


1653
02:20:32.597 --> 02:20:38.764
<i>without becoming frenzied
and hysterical and mad.</i>


1654
02:20:49.489 --> 02:20:50.536
<i>I fled.</i>

1655
02:21:05.172 --> 02:21:08.540
<i>I spent the night weeping,</i>

1656
02:21:08.633 --> 02:21:12.297
<i>and I think I lost faith
in this whole wretched human race.</i>


1657
02:21:26.735 --> 02:21:28.533
Feels like a big one.

1658
02:21:43.585 --> 02:21:44.871
What are you doing, Papa?

1659
02:21:46.880 --> 02:21:47.995
Papa?

1660
02:21:48.965 --> 02:21:50.171
Papa!

1661
02:21:50.467 --> 02:21:51.582
Papa!

1662
02:21:52.052 --> 02:21:53.429
Pull it in, Papa!

1663
02:21:55.680 --> 02:21:56.852
Papa!

1664
02:22:00.102 --> 02:22:02.514
Papa! Papa!

1665
02:23:54.549 --> 02:23:57.849
Do you remember that song?
The song we used to sing?


1666
02:23:58.595 --> 02:24:00.302
It just came to me.

1667
02:24:05.560 --> 02:24:09.190
Aren't you glad I moved us out here,
away from those bars?


1668
02:24:13.068 --> 02:24:14.536
There you go.

1669
02:24:27.749 --> 02:24:29.797
You need your peace and quiet.

1670
02:24:47.769 --> 02:24:51.490
<i>Writing, at its best,
is a lonely life.</i>


1671
02:24:53.858 --> 02:24:56.350
<i>As a writer grows in public stature,</i>

1672
02:24:56.695 --> 02:24:58.493
<i>he sheds his loneliness,</i>

1673
02:24:59.239 --> 02:25:01.583
<i>and often his work deteriorates,</i>

1674
02:25:03.743 --> 02:25:06.417
<i>for he does his work alone.</i>

1675
02:25:09.833 --> 02:25:12.052
<i>And if he's a good enough writer,</i>

1676
02:25:13.086 --> 02:25:17.205
<i>he must face eternity,
or the lack of it,</i>

1677
02:25:20.760 --> 02:25:22.376
<i>each day.</i>

1678
02:25:59.924 --> 02:26:01.267
Miss Gellhorn?

1679
02:26:07.432 --> 02:26:10.766
For the past 45 years,
you've covered conflicts everywhere.


1680
02:26:10.935 --> 02:26:13.905
Burma, Singapore, the Middle East,
Central America,


1681
02:26:14.272 --> 02:26:17.105
Vietnam, Africa, 
Bosnia, on and on.

1682
02:26:17.734 --> 02:26:20.442
And for a woman
to have done all this...

1683
02:26:21.946 --> 02:26:24.779
Were you trying to put yourself in danger?

1684
02:26:25.367 --> 02:26:27.288
I don't have those complexes.

1685
02:26:27.289 --> 02:26:28.753
That's something men do.

1686
02:26:28.828 --> 02:26:30.785
Yes. Men.

1687
02:26:31.623 --> 02:26:33.967
Well, since you mentioned men...

1688
02:26:34.793 --> 02:26:36.784
Well, we're both journalists,
I'm sure you'll understand.


1689
02:26:36.795 --> 02:26:40.220
Our viewers would like to know more
about your relationship with the man


1690
02:26:43.134 --> 02:26:44.181
No.

1691
02:26:44.636 --> 02:26:47.856
Something about your debt?

1692
02:26:48.473 --> 02:26:49.725
My debt?

1693
02:26:51.518 --> 02:26:53.441
Your debt to Hemingway?

1694
02:26:59.776 --> 02:27:02.268
The man has been dead for 30 years.

1695
02:27:04.739 --> 02:27:07.959
He tortured no one so much
as he tortured himself.


1696
02:27:10.328 --> 02:27:11.944
I wish him peace.

1697
02:27:16.793 --> 02:27:19.012
That's all I have
to say on the subject.

1698
02:27:24.843 --> 02:27:28.473
I do not see myself as a footnote
to someone else's life.


1699
02:27:35.478 --> 02:27:36.889
Turn it off.

1700
02:27:39.107 --> 02:27:40.154
We're done.

1701
02:27:47.532 --> 02:27:50.274
Thank you, Miss Gellhorn, for your time.

1702
02:28:23.234 --> 02:28:24.850
<i>My dearest Marty,</i>

1703
02:28:25.737 --> 02:28:27.694
<i>one thing you must know,</i>

1704
02:28:28.907 --> 02:28:32.753
<i>love is infinitely more durable than hate.</i>

1705
02:29:18.957 --> 02:29:20.368
God damn it.

1706
02:29:34.097 --> 02:29:35.599
It's Gellhorn.

1707
02:29:38.226 --> 02:29:40.445
I've decided to go after all.

1708
02:29:40.645 --> 02:29:43.979
Why? Because, as usual,
<i>The Times</i> got it wrong again.


1709
02:29:45.858 --> 02:29:47.858
All that drivel,
all that goddamn objectivity shit.


1710
02:29:49.279 --> 02:29:50.986
I'm going to be on the next plane.

1711
02:29:51.656 --> 02:29:55.240
No. Well, God damn it,
I'll pay on my own dime.


1712
02:29:57.662 --> 02:30:00.336
I can't wait for you to
grow a pair of balls.


1713
02:30:01.165 --> 02:30:02.508
You relax.

1714
02:30:04.168 --> 02:30:05.215
No.

1715
02:30:07.171 --> 02:30:09.162
Don't worry about me.

1716
02:30:12.093 --> 02:30:13.686
I love you, too.

1717
02:30:17.181 --> 02:30:19.343
I'm not dead yet, you fuck.
