Your father was seduced by
the dark side of the Force.

He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker
and became Darth Vader.

When that happened, the good man
who was your father was destroyed.

So what I told you was true,

many of the truths we cling to

Anakin was a good friend.

When I first knew him,
your father was already a great pilot,

but I was amazed
how strongly the Force was with him.

I took it upon myself
to train him as a Jedi.

00:46:54.614 --> 00:46:58.827
I thought that I could instruct him
just as well as Yoda.


485
00:46:59.035 --> 00:47:00.245

There is still good in him.

493
00:47:23.226 --> 00:47:27.314
Then the Emperor has already won.

494
00:47:27.522 --> 00:47:30.817
You were our only hope.

495
00:47:31.026 --> 00:47:33.487
Yoda spoke of another.

496
00:47:35.238 --> 00:47:37.908
The other he spoke of
is your twin sister.


497
00:47:38.742 --> 00:47:40.744
- But I have no sister.
- Hmm.


498
00:47:41.828 --> 00:47:43.663
To protect you both from the Emperor,

499
00:47:43.872 --> 00:47:47.501
you were hidden from your father
when you were born.


500
00:47:47.709 --> 00:47:50.045
The Emperor knew, as I did,

501
00:47:50.253 --> 00:47:53.799
if Anakin were to have any offspring,

502
00:47:54.007 --> 00:47:56.384
they would be a threat to him.

503
00:47:56.593 --> 00:48:01.807
That is the reason why
your sister remains safely anonymous.


504
00:48:02.390 --> 00:48:04.184
Leia!

505
00:48:04.392 --> 00:48:05.852
Leia's my sister.

506
00:48:06.061 --> 00:48:09.397
Your insight serves you well.

507
00:48:09.606 --> 00:48:12.776
Bury your feelings deep down, Luke.

508
00:48:13.151 --> 00:48:18.114
They do you credit, but they
could be made to serve the Emperor.


509
00:48:40.846 --> 00:48:43.348
Well, look at you, a general, huh?

510
00:48:43.431 --> 00:48:44.766
Someone must have told them

511
00:48:44.850 --> 00:48:46.852
about my little manoeuvre
at the Battle of Tanaab.


512
00:48:47.227 --> 00:48:49.980
Well, don't look at me, pal.
I just said you were a fair pilot.


513
00:48:50.063 --> 00:48:52.941
I didn't know they were looking
for somebody to lead this crazy attack.


514
00:48:53.024 --> 00:48:55.777
I'm surprised
they didn't ask you to do it.


515
00:48:55.986 --> 00:48:57.988
Who says they didn't? 
But I ain't crazy.

516
00:48:58.071 --> 00:49:00.657
You're the respectable one, remember?

517
00:49:08.039 --> 00:49:11.251
The Emperor's made a critical error,
and the time for our attack has come.


518
00:49:12.043 --> 00:49:14.129
The data brought to us
by the Bothan spies


519
00:49:14.212 --> 00:49:18.091
pinpoint the exact location
of the Emperor's new battle station.


520
00:49:18.425 --> 00:49:20.969
We also know that
the weapon systems of this Death Star


521
00:49:21.052 --> 00:49:22.470
are not yet operational.

522
00:49:22.929 --> 00:49:25.390
With the Imperial fleet
spread throughout the galaxy,


523
00:49:25.473 --> 00:49:27.017
in a vain effort to engage us,

524
00:49:27.100 --> 00:49:29.060
it is relatively unprotected.

525
00:49:29.519 --> 00:49:32.147
But most important of all,

526
00:49:32.230 --> 00:49:35.400
we've learned that the Emperor himself
is personally overseeing


527
00:49:35.483 --> 00:49:38.862
the final stages of the construction
of this Death Star.


528
00:49:39.779 --> 00:49:43.658
Many Bothans died to
bring us this information.


529
00:49:46.202 --> 00:49:47.621
Admiral Ackbar, please.

530
00:49:48.163 --> 00:49:53.460
You can see here the Death Star
orbiting the forest moon of Endor.


531
00:49:53.793 --> 00:49:58.506
Although the weapon systems on
this Death Star are not yet operational,


532
00:49:58.924 --> 00:50:02.677
the Death Star does have
a strong defence mechanism.


533
00:50:03.887 --> 00:50:06.139
It is protected by an energy shield

534
00:50:06.222 --> 00:50:09.601
which is generated from
the nearby forest moon of Endor.


535
00:50:15.148 --> 00:50:19.444
The shield must be deactivated
if any attack is to be attempted.


536
00:50:20.695 --> 00:50:24.741
Once the shield is down,
our cruisers will create a perimeter


537
00:50:24.824 --> 00:50:27.661
while the fighters
fly into the superstructure


538
00:50:27.744 --> 00:50:30.622
and attempt to
knock out the main reactor.


539
00:50:33.583 --> 00:50:37.087
General Calrissian has volunteered
to lead the fighter attack.


540
00:50:37.170 --> 00:50:38.213
Good luck.

541
00:50:40.173 --> 00:50:41.758
You're going to need it.

General Madine.

543
00:50:44.469 --> 00:50:47.597
We have stolen a small Imperial shuttle.

544
00:50:47.973 --> 00:50:51.935
Disguised as a cargo ship
and using a secret Imperial code,


545
00:50:52.018 --> 00:50:56.815
a strike team will land on the moon
and deactivate the shield generator.


546
00:50:57.107 --> 00:50:58.233
C-3PO: Sounds dangerous.

547
00:50:58.316 --> 00:51:00.610
I wonder who they found
to pull that off.


548
00:51:00.694 --> 00:51:03.571
General Solo,
is your strike team assembled?


549
00:51:04.406 --> 00:51:05.407
My team's ready.

550
00:51:05.490 --> 00:51:07.742
I don't have a command crew
for the shuttle.

Luke, don't talk that way.

859
01:19:49.003 --> 01:19:53.133
You have a power I don't understand
and could never have.

You're wrong, Leia.

You have that power, too.

In time, you'll learn to use it

then leave this place.

I've felt it.

882
01:21:07.123 --> 01:21:08.833
He won't turn me over to the Emperor.

883
01:21:08.917 --> 01:21:12.086
I can save him.
I can turn him back to the good side.

for a little while.

891

I can't tell you.

Is that who you could tell?

894

I believe there may be more of them,


898
01:23:22.216 --> 01:23:25.094
and I request permission
to conduct a further search of the area.


899

So, you have accepted the truth.

once Anakin Skywalker, my father.

That name no longer
has any meaning for me.

It is the name of your true self.
You've only forgotten.

I know there is good in you.

The Emperor hasn't driven it
from you fully.

That was why you couldn't destroy me.

That's why you won't bring me
to your Emperor now.

a new lightsaber.

wasn't on that thing when it blew.


1303
02:03:37.296 --> 02:03:38.505
He wasn't.

1304
02:03:39.506 --> 02:03:41.383
I can feel it.

1305
02:03:45.763 --> 02:03:47.306
You love him.

1306
02:03:50.642 --> 02:03:51.852
Don't you?

1307
02:03:52.561 --> 02:03:53.645
Yes.

1308
02:03:54.146 --> 02:03:56.315
All right. I understand.

1309
02:03:56.899 --> 02:03:57.983
Fine.

1310
02:03:59.276 --> 02:04:00.778
When he comes back,

1311
02:04:02.237 --> 02:04:03.655
I won't get in the way.

1312
02:04:06.575 --> 02:04:08.243
It's not like that at all.

1313
02:04:11.580 --> 02:04:13.415
He's my brother.
