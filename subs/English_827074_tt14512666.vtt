3
00:00:21.322 --> 00:00:23.281
James, hey, wake up.

4
00:00:23.366 --> 00:00:25.575
Honey, honey, I think
there's someone in the house.


5
00:01:06.326 --> 00:01:09.285
James! James, wake up!
James, wake up!


6
00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:12.622
Wake up, James!
There's somebody down here!


7
00:01:12.665 --> 00:01:14.540
Help! Help!

8
00:01:14.626 --> 00:01:16.709
Somebody help me!

9
00:01:16.794 --> 00:01:18.294
Please! Please!

10
00:01:40.902 --> 00:01:45.321
Mm! Morning.

11
00:01:47.116 --> 00:01:49.575
Morning, wife.

12
00:01:49.661 --> 00:01:51.619
I didn't know you were up.

13
00:01:51.704 --> 00:01:53.913
"Wife."
I didn't think I was the...


14
00:01:53.998 --> 00:01:56.999
"hey, we're in vegas,
let's get hitched" kind of girl.


15
00:01:57.085 --> 00:01:59.585
Yeah? Well, here we are.

16
00:01:59.671 --> 00:02:01.671
Hmm. Damn right.

17
00:02:06.052 --> 00:02:07.760
I got you something.

18
00:02:07.845 --> 00:02:09.470
You did?

19
00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:13.683
It's just a little
post-wedding gift,


20
00:02:13.768 --> 00:02:16.352
a small token my love.

21
00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.355
Babe...

22
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.315
I didn't get you anything.

23
00:02:21.401 --> 00:02:23.526
You give me everything.

24
00:02:27.073 --> 00:02:28.364
Go ahead, open it.

25
00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:39.500
Wow.

26
00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:45.506
You said you had a watch like it
in your twenties that you lost.


27
00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:49.051
Yeah. I just...

28
00:02:49.137 --> 00:02:53.139
I can't believe that you
remembered that story, babe.


29
00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.183
Thank you.

30
00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:57.685
You're welcome.

31
00:03:00.773 --> 00:03:02.606
Wow.

32
00:03:02.692 --> 00:03:06.277
Uh, so...

33
00:03:06.362 --> 00:03:09.029
Is Mara cool with this?

34
00:03:09.115 --> 00:03:11.407
With us, you know,
getting married now?


35
00:03:11.492 --> 00:03:13.200
I
-I think so.

36
00:03:13.244 --> 00:03:15.139
We're gonna have to do something
more formal with her


37
00:03:15.163 --> 00:03:16.412
sometime soon, but...

38
00:03:16.456 --> 00:03:17.830
Absolutely.

39
00:03:17.915 --> 00:03:19.874
And my mom is gonna
move in with us,


40
00:03:19.917 --> 00:03:23.002
so, you know, we can all
celebrate our love together.


41
00:03:23.087 --> 00:03:25.921
Oh, I like the sound of that.

42
00:03:27.508 --> 00:03:29.091
What time's our flight?

43
00:03:29.135 --> 00:03:32.052
It's at noon,
so I'll go pick her up and...


44
00:03:32.138 --> 00:03:34.013
Really, I can't
thank you guys enough


45
00:03:34.098 --> 00:03:35.931
for letting her stay with us.

46
00:03:35.975 --> 00:03:38.434
It means a lot. 
I just moved in,

47
00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:41.896
and now you got
two of us to deal with.


48
00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:43.147
We're family.

49
00:03:43.232 --> 00:03:45.608
I guess it was
a little bit weird


50
00:03:45.693 --> 00:03:47.109
that you and I tied the knot,

51
00:03:47.195 --> 00:03:49.403
and I haven't even
met your mom, but...


52
00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:51.947
Yeah, she's just...

53
00:03:52.033 --> 00:03:54.408
Maggie's been too sick
to travel lately.


54
00:03:54.494 --> 00:04:00.456
I'm telling you, Kristen,
diabetes can be a real bitch.


55
00:04:01.501 --> 00:04:03.125
I should warn you,

56
00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:05.795
I can kinda make her one too.

57
00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.298
Well, I'm sure I can handle her.

58
00:04:09.383 --> 00:04:13.260
I mean, I know I can handle you.

59
00:04:24.857 --> 00:04:27.149
Your form is so good.

60
00:04:28.486 --> 00:04:29.568
Hi.

61
00:04:31.906 --> 00:04:33.383
Look, I don't mean
to ruin your workout.


62
00:04:33.407 --> 00:04:35.449
I just want to check in on you.

63
00:04:35.535 --> 00:04:39.036
Oh, no, it's no worries.
I was just about done.


64
00:04:39.121 --> 00:04:41.121
Hey, I didn't see James
this morning? Where is he?


65
00:04:41.165 --> 00:04:43.833
He's picking his mother up
at the airport, remember?


66
00:04:43.876 --> 00:04:46.502
Oh, yeah, that's today.

67
00:04:46.587 --> 00:04:49.630
You two have been a couple
for like, what, six months now?


68
00:04:49.715 --> 00:04:52.716
I cannot believe you
haven't even met his mom.


69
00:04:52.802 --> 00:04:55.511
Well, I think that this way,

70
00:04:55.596 --> 00:04:58.514
isn't it awesome
we get to meet her together?


71
00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:00.599
Yeah, sure, why not?

72
00:05:00.685 --> 00:05:05.312
Honey, I know I've asked you
this a bunch of times, but you...


73
00:05:05.356 --> 00:05:07.314
You're not upset, right?

74
00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.483
I mean, about us running off
to get married?


75
00:05:09.527 --> 00:05:12.528
No, no. I just...

76
00:05:12.613 --> 00:05:15.364
I think that maybe
it feels a little...


77
00:05:16.993 --> 00:05:18.701
Soon?

78
00:05:18.744 --> 00:05:21.745
I usually reserve that term
for bad jokes about tragedy,


79
00:05:21.831 --> 00:05:24.206
but yeah, maybe a little.

80
00:05:26.294 --> 00:05:28.502
But you like him though, right?

81
00:05:28.546 --> 00:05:31.755
James? Oh, yeah, I really do.

82
00:05:31.841 --> 00:05:34.008
I see the way
that he treats you.


83
00:05:34.093 --> 00:05:37.887
It's very sweet,
and I think that you deserve it.


84
00:05:37.972 --> 00:05:42.683
But like you said, it just...
It happened so fast,


85
00:05:42.768 --> 00:05:45.227
and I feel like you're still
pretty vulnerable


86
00:05:45.313 --> 00:05:47.396
after everything that happened
last year.


87
00:05:49.358 --> 00:05:50.399
Maybe.

88
00:05:52.236 --> 00:05:56.280
Honey, I'm an adult,
and I know what's right for me.


89
00:05:56.365 --> 00:06:01.535
I'm so much better
than a year ago.


90
00:06:01.621 --> 00:06:03.037
You know?

91
00:06:03.122 --> 00:06:07.541
You and James
are a big part of why.


92
00:06:09.045 --> 00:06:11.503
Heck, you know,
between my loving daughter


93
00:06:11.589 --> 00:06:13.380
and my new husband and shrink,

94
00:06:13.466 --> 00:06:15.049
I'm pretty much as good as new.

95
00:06:15.134 --> 00:06:17.092
I know how terrible it all was,

96
00:06:17.178 --> 00:06:20.638
but honestly, mom,
think about it like this.


97
00:06:20.723 --> 00:06:23.515
How many people really get stuck
twice in their lifetime?


98
00:06:25.728 --> 00:06:27.311
I have no idea,

99
00:06:27.396 --> 00:06:30.606
but if there's one,
that's one too many.


100
00:06:48.209 --> 00:06:51.669
Mom, I would like
for you to meet


101
00:06:51.754 --> 00:06:54.505
my gorgeous
and generous wife, Kristen,


102
00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:57.132
and her awesome and equally
generous daughter, Mara.


103
00:06:57.176 --> 00:07:00.302
This is my mom, Maggie.

104
00:07:00.388 --> 00:07:02.930
It's so nice
to finally meet you, Maggie.


105
00:07:03.015 --> 00:07:05.307
Welcome to our home.

106
00:07:05.351 --> 00:07:08.018
Yeah. Our casa is your casa.

107
00:07:08.104 --> 00:07:10.229
Mm.

108
00:07:10.314 --> 00:07:13.232
Mom, would you like to say
something to your host?


109
00:07:13.317 --> 00:07:14.608
Where's my room?

110
00:07:14.652 --> 00:07:18.445
Mom, come on, be nice.

111
00:07:18.531 --> 00:07:23.200
Thank you for allowing me
to stay with my boy.


112
00:07:23.285 --> 00:07:26.704
Uh, you're welcome.
We're happy to have you.


113
00:07:26.789 --> 00:07:28.747
Yeah, we are happy
to have you, mom.


114
00:07:28.833 --> 00:07:31.500
- Let's sit down.
- Isn't that nice?


115
00:07:36.382 --> 00:07:39.550
Well, I'll try not to be
too much trouble.


116
00:07:39.635 --> 00:07:42.678
Oh, I'm sure it'll be
no trouble at all.


117
00:07:42.763 --> 00:07:44.304
Say cheese.

118
00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:45.639
Oh! What are you doing?

119
00:07:45.725 --> 00:07:48.017
Just taking your picture.

120
00:07:48.102 --> 00:07:50.394
- Why?
- Posterity?


121
00:07:50.479 --> 00:07:54.189
I hate having my photo taken.
Put that thing away now!


122
00:07:54.233 --> 00:07:56.817
- It's okay.
- It's okay, mom, it's okay.


123
00:07:56.902 --> 00:07:58.777
Why don't I go get
some refreshments?


124
00:07:58.863 --> 00:08:00.195
Hey, Mara, would you help me?

125
00:08:00.239 --> 00:08:02.031
- Oh, yeah, sure, yeah.
- Great.


126
00:08:02.074 --> 00:08:04.700
Let's leave these two to get
a little better acquainted.


127
00:08:04.785 --> 00:08:06.535
- Right.
- All right.


128
00:08:10.124 --> 00:08:12.332
So it's... it's Kristen, right?

129
00:08:12.418 --> 00:08:15.127
That's me.

130
00:08:17.089 --> 00:08:19.882
Well, you got a good-sized
house here, Kristen.


131
00:08:19.925 --> 00:08:22.009
Oh, thanks.

132
00:08:22.094 --> 00:08:27.056
A bit tacky for my taste, but
that's neither here nor there.


133
00:08:27.099 --> 00:08:29.558
Good for you,
living high on that hog.


134
00:08:29.602 --> 00:08:32.895
You get the money from your
first husband or something?


135
00:08:33.898 --> 00:08:36.231
Um, no.

136
00:08:36.317 --> 00:08:42.196
Actually, Mara's father
passed away when she was little.


137
00:08:42.239 --> 00:08:45.699
For the record, I'm the
breadwinner of the family.


138
00:08:45.785 --> 00:08:47.659
Oh, is that right?

139
00:08:47.745 --> 00:08:49.703
What exactly does
the breadwinner do


140
00:08:49.789 --> 00:08:52.081
to make all that dough rise?

141
00:08:52.124 --> 00:08:53.373
I'm a divorce attorney.

142
00:08:53.459 --> 00:08:56.293
Ah! Got it.

143
00:08:56.378 --> 00:08:59.213
So while all those miserable,
desperate people


144
00:08:59.298 --> 00:09:01.340
are suffering right there
in front of you,


145
00:09:01.425 --> 00:09:02.883
you're just sitting there,

146
00:09:02.968 --> 00:09:05.844
billing the hours
and raking in that cash.


147
00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:08.597
I mean, I'm not just
sitting there.


148
00:09:08.682 --> 00:09:11.433
Oh, no, of course not.
I'm just kidding.


149
00:09:12.937 --> 00:09:16.021
So how'd you get my boy
to marry you anyway?


150
00:09:17.525 --> 00:09:19.399
Uh, well, actually, it was...

151
00:09:19.485 --> 00:09:21.610
James was the only one
who suggested


152
00:09:21.695 --> 00:09:24.029
that we do it on the spot.

153
00:09:24.115 --> 00:09:27.074
Was the wedding nice or what?

154
00:09:27.159 --> 00:09:30.786
'Cause this mother of the groom
never saw a damn photo.


155
00:09:32.873 --> 00:09:35.207
Here you go.

156
00:09:35.292 --> 00:09:38.544
Now we're family, all of us.

157
00:09:40.047 --> 00:09:41.213
Isn't that wonderful?

158
00:09:41.298 --> 00:09:45.008
Yeah, I feel the same way.

159
00:09:45.094 --> 00:09:46.802
See? Look at you two. I knew it.

160
00:09:46.887 --> 00:09:49.388
Couple peas in a pod.

161
00:09:53.227 --> 00:09:54.810
Mom, is everything okay?

162
00:09:54.895 --> 00:09:57.271
Yeah, yeah, I'm great.

163
00:09:57.314 --> 00:09:59.106
This is gonna be so much fun.

164
00:10:06.866 --> 00:10:09.241
You wanted to see me? What's up?

165
00:10:09.326 --> 00:10:10.868
- Come here.
- Yeah?


166
00:10:10.953 --> 00:10:12.619
I just...

167
00:10:12.663 --> 00:10:14.496
What's going on?

168
00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:18.458
Kristen, just say it.

169
00:10:18.544 --> 00:10:20.961
Did your mother
say anything to you about me?


170
00:10:21.046 --> 00:10:26.842
Just that she was thankful that
you opened up your home to her.


171
00:10:26.927 --> 00:10:29.845
Really? She said that?

172
00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:31.950
I get the feeling that she
doesn't like me all that much,


173
00:10:31.974 --> 00:10:33.974
and I have no idea
what I did wrong.


174
00:10:34.059 --> 00:10:35.225
Okay, what happened?

175
00:10:35.311 --> 00:10:37.227
Was it something
in her tone, maybe?


176
00:10:37.313 --> 00:10:39.188
More like something
in her words.


177
00:10:39.231 --> 00:10:41.231
Oh, kris, I don't know.

178
00:10:41.317 --> 00:10:43.358
She's just from a different era.

179
00:10:43.402 --> 00:10:45.881
And yeah, I mean, she could be
a little rough around the edges.


180
00:10:45.905 --> 00:10:46.987
You think?

181
00:10:47.072 --> 00:10:49.823
Trust me, she has a big heart,

182
00:10:49.867 --> 00:10:51.867
and it's usually
in the right place.


183
00:10:51.952 --> 00:10:54.536
She's probably just testing you,

184
00:10:54.622 --> 00:10:56.705
see what you're made of.

185
00:10:56.749 --> 00:10:59.875
Great. I got enough
on the first day.


186
00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:01.376
Look at me.

187
00:11:01.462 --> 00:11:03.045
Relax, okay?

188
00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:05.756
I love you and Mara.

189
00:11:05.841 --> 00:11:09.176
And yeah,
this happened really fast,


190
00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:11.720
but we have the rest of
our lives to take it easy.


191
00:11:11.764 --> 00:11:13.639
All of us.

192
00:11:13.724 --> 00:11:17.351
So let's just let Maggie get
used to her new surroundings.


193
00:11:17.436 --> 00:11:21.730
I promise.
This is all gonna work out.


194
00:11:21.774 --> 00:11:22.981
Come here.

195
00:11:26.445 --> 00:11:27.903
Thank you.

196
00:11:39.166 --> 00:11:41.083
What are you doing here?

197
00:11:41.168 --> 00:11:43.835
Well, maybe I just wanted to see
that pretty face of yours.


198
00:11:43.921 --> 00:11:45.921
What do you want, Ross?

199
00:11:47.883 --> 00:11:50.926
Your request for child support
is killing me, baby.


200
00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:53.262
Excuse me. "Baby?"

201
00:11:53.305 --> 00:11:55.389
you know I don't have
that much money.


202
00:11:55.474 --> 00:11:57.933
Shrinks make way more money
than private investigators.


203
00:11:57.977 --> 00:12:00.269
It's not my fault. And you know
I hate the word "shrink."


204
00:12:00.354 --> 00:12:03.063
you know, I don't even know
why we're getting divorced.


205
00:12:03.148 --> 00:12:05.816
Because you slept with
your secretary, remember?


206
00:12:05.901 --> 00:12:07.150
Right.

207
00:12:07.236 --> 00:12:08.610
Hi.

208
00:12:09.571 --> 00:12:11.113
Good morning.

209
00:12:11.198 --> 00:12:13.448
Sorry. Did I make a mistake?
Is this not my hour?


210
00:12:13.534 --> 00:12:16.326
No, no. I'm sorry, Kristen,
of course it is.


211
00:12:16.412 --> 00:12:19.705
- I'll call you later.
- I know you will.


212
00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.166
Oh, please, come in.

213
00:12:23.252 --> 00:12:24.543
Thanks.

214
00:12:26.964 --> 00:12:28.630
Apologies again, Kristen.

215
00:12:28.674 --> 00:12:31.049
That's my soon-to-be ex,
and he...


216
00:12:31.135 --> 00:12:32.926
Oh, never mind.

217
00:12:33.012 --> 00:12:35.470
I'm sure you hear about this
divorce stuff all day long,


218
00:12:35.514 --> 00:12:39.099
and that is not at all
the reason you're here.


219
00:12:39.184 --> 00:12:40.642
How are you doing?

220
00:12:40.728 --> 00:12:44.187
- I'm, uh, I'm okay.
- You sure?


221
00:12:44.273 --> 00:12:46.940
You seem a little more
undone today than usual.


222
00:12:46.984 --> 00:12:48.108
Did something happen?

223
00:12:48.152 --> 00:12:51.653
- Maggie happened.
- Maggie?


224
00:12:51.739 --> 00:12:53.780
James' mother moved in with us
a couple days ago.


225
00:12:53.866 --> 00:12:58.869
Okay, so you have someone new
living in your house.


226
00:12:58.954 --> 00:13:00.412
She has diabetes,

227
00:13:00.497 --> 00:13:02.456
and she has to use a walker
to get around.


228
00:13:02.541 --> 00:13:05.125
That poor woman. That's awful.

229
00:13:05.169 --> 00:13:07.002
What's she like?

230
00:13:07.046 --> 00:13:08.648
She doesn't like me,
I can tell you that much.


231
00:13:08.672 --> 00:13:10.380
- How do you know?
- I don't know.


232
00:13:10.466 --> 00:13:13.508
Just the way that
she looks at me, you know.


233
00:13:13.594 --> 00:13:17.012
Just cold, dismissive.

234
00:13:17.097 --> 00:13:18.805
The first time we met,

235
00:13:18.891 --> 00:13:21.975
she said something to me about
my quickie wedding with her boy.


236
00:13:22.061 --> 00:13:24.311
Oh, sounds to me like
she's just a little hurt


237
00:13:24.396 --> 00:13:26.438
that she didn't get to see
you two get married.


238
00:13:26.523 --> 00:13:29.983
Sounded more to me like she was
upset she didn't get to stop it.


239
00:13:30.069 --> 00:13:33.820
Well, mothers-in-laws
and new brides butting heads,


240
00:13:33.906 --> 00:13:36.156
that's not exactly
an uncommon thing.


241
00:13:36.241 --> 00:13:40.494
But how's your mind doing,
otherwise?


242
00:13:40.579 --> 00:13:44.039
I'm, uh, I'm good.

243
00:13:44.124 --> 00:13:47.417
No, I mean, I haven't had any
nightmares the past few months.


244
00:13:47.503 --> 00:13:49.544
Mm-hmm.

245
00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:52.297
I feel like I can, I don't know,
go about my business


246
00:13:52.383 --> 00:13:54.257
without looking
in every direction


247
00:13:54.343 --> 00:13:57.719
for some guy
creeping up behind me and...


248
00:13:57.763 --> 00:13:59.805
I don't know. I can just...

249
00:13:59.890 --> 00:14:02.224
Breathe, I guess.

250
00:14:02.309 --> 00:14:05.310
You know, just... 
Little things.

251
00:14:05.396 --> 00:14:08.355
Not so little. News flash!

252
00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:11.733
I mean, your stalker actually
made it into your house.


253
00:14:11.777 --> 00:14:13.360
That's terrifying.

254
00:14:16.323 --> 00:14:18.740
I know, I know. 
I'm just, um...

255
00:14:18.826 --> 00:14:21.910
I mean, sometimes I feel like
maybe I overreacted.


256
00:14:21.954 --> 00:14:24.579
Your reaction
was perfectly natural.


257
00:14:24.665 --> 00:14:26.706
Lots of people out there
would've experienced


258
00:14:26.792 --> 00:14:29.543
some kind of breakdown
from that.


259
00:14:29.586 --> 00:14:31.878
If you ask me,
you're doing great.


260
00:14:34.633 --> 00:14:36.007
Thanks, Dr. Lewis.

261
00:14:37.511 --> 00:14:40.053
Thanks to you, you know,

262
00:14:40.097 --> 00:14:43.932
and, uh, and my family,
of course.


263
00:14:50.649 --> 00:14:52.232
Actually, none of them's
been around.


264
00:14:52.317 --> 00:14:55.902
Okay, well, gotta be careful.
They might be watching.


265
00:14:55.946 --> 00:14:57.112
[door closes]

266
00:14:58.449 --> 00:15:00.740
- Hey, girlie.
- Hey, what's up, kid?


267
00:15:00.826 --> 00:15:02.706
I'm just waiting for Michael
to come pick me up.


268
00:15:02.786 --> 00:15:04.327
We're gonna go grab
a bite to eat.


269
00:15:04.413 --> 00:15:06.413
And who is this Michael person?

270
00:15:06.498 --> 00:15:07.956
He's my boo.

271
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.583
Your boo?

272
00:15:09.668 --> 00:15:11.793
Is he a damn ghost or something?

273
00:15:11.879 --> 00:15:14.629
Mom, she's talking
about her boyfriend,


274
00:15:14.715 --> 00:15:16.298
and I happen to like the kid.

275
00:15:16.383 --> 00:15:18.175
[doorbell rings]

276
00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:19.968
That must be him.

277
00:15:20.012 --> 00:15:23.722
Michael, you can come in.
We're in the living room.


278
00:15:26.059 --> 00:15:26.975
There he is!

279
00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:29.144
Hey, what's up, James?

280
00:15:29.188 --> 00:15:32.981
Well, my spirits, now I got my
lovely mother here in one piece.


281
00:15:33.025 --> 00:15:34.524
Or two.

282
00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:36.443
How's it hanging, kid?
I'm Maggie.


283
00:15:36.528 --> 00:15:41.448
Michael. And it's hanging
just fine, I guess.


284
00:15:41.533 --> 00:15:43.333
Your mom actually allows you
to have boys over


285
00:15:43.410 --> 00:15:45.285
when she's not home?

286
00:15:45.370 --> 00:15:46.953
I'm 19.

287
00:15:47.039 --> 00:15:49.664
Exactly my point.
Like little rabbits at your age.


288
00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:52.501
Bop bop bop bop bop bop!

289
00:15:52.544 --> 00:15:54.294
Oh, my god.

290
00:15:54.338 --> 00:15:56.129
Where is Kristen anyway?

291
00:15:56.215 --> 00:15:58.131
She is at a therapy session.

292
00:15:58.175 --> 00:15:59.549
You gotta be kidding me.

293
00:15:59.635 --> 00:16:03.261
You know what we call therapy
at my age?


294
00:16:03.347 --> 00:16:05.764
Sucking it up
and walking it off.


295
00:16:05.849 --> 00:16:07.474
Uh...

296
00:16:07.559 --> 00:16:12.729
Therapy. It's like a weak sauce
on a feeble sandwich.


297
00:16:12.814 --> 00:16:16.191
That's a little harsh.
I don't think it's weird for her


298
00:16:16.276 --> 00:16:18.193
to get help after everything
she's been through.


299
00:16:18.278 --> 00:16:22.239
Oh? And what happened?

300
00:16:22.324 --> 00:16:25.325
You know what? I'm starving.
Should we go?


301
00:16:25.410 --> 00:16:26.868
- Let's do this.
- Yeah.


302
00:16:26.954 --> 00:16:30.872
Hey, Michael, come here.
Got something to tell you.


303
00:16:31.917 --> 00:16:33.500
Um...

304
00:16:36.255 --> 00:16:37.879
Yeah, what's up?

305
00:16:37.965 --> 00:16:40.298
You gotta lean in
if I'm gonna tell you.


306
00:16:41.885 --> 00:16:42.885
Boo!

307
00:16:42.928 --> 00:16:45.804
- Mom...
- [laughs]


308
00:16:45.889 --> 00:16:48.098
You're a strange one, Maggie.

309
00:16:48.183 --> 00:16:51.393
Yeah. Always have been,
always will be.


310
00:16:51.436 --> 00:16:52.894
Hey, come on, Michael. Let's go.

311
00:16:54.398 --> 00:16:55.480
See ya.

312
00:16:55.566 --> 00:16:57.065
You two have fun.

313
00:16:59.111 --> 00:17:01.194
Bring me back some cheesecake!

314
00:17:01.238 --> 00:17:02.404
[door closes]

315
00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:09.327
So Maggie, she's a real
kick in the ass, huh?


316
00:17:09.413 --> 00:17:11.246
Yeah, she is.

317
00:17:11.290 --> 00:17:13.206
She's gonna need
to stop kicking at my mom,


318
00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:15.417
or we're gonna have a problem.

319
00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:18.420
How's your mom been holding up
with the new houseguest anyways?


320
00:17:18.463 --> 00:17:20.714
She's struggling.
And I can tell too.


321
00:17:20.799 --> 00:17:23.216
And she was doing so well
after everything that happened.


322
00:17:23.302 --> 00:17:25.635
The last thing she needs is
this lady picking at her,


323
00:17:25.721 --> 00:17:27.178
making her crazy.

324
00:17:27.264 --> 00:17:28.388
Yeah.

325
00:17:39.318 --> 00:17:42.277

[Kristen gasps]

328
00:17:56.043 --> 00:17:57.792
Whoa! What's that face?

329
00:17:57.878 --> 00:17:59.439
I just barely avoided getting
attacked in the parking lot.


330
00:17:59.463 --> 00:18:01.630
Oh, my god. Are you serious?

331
00:18:01.673 --> 00:18:03.632
Steve, do me a favor.
Call building management.


332
00:18:03.717 --> 00:18:05.778
They need to get on their game
and up security around here.


333
00:18:05.802 --> 00:18:07.218
That is unacceptable!

334
00:18:07.304 --> 00:18:09.596
Wow. You were really
almost just attacked?


335
00:18:09.681 --> 00:18:14.142
I mean, I definitely saw
someone following me.


336
00:18:14.186 --> 00:18:17.145
You mean towards the entrance
to the building?


337
00:18:18.398 --> 00:18:20.815
Well, y-yeah.

338
00:18:20.859 --> 00:18:22.817
Well, how close
did the guy get to you?


339
00:18:22.861 --> 00:18:25.278
Was he like, like a car length?

340
00:18:25.364 --> 00:18:26.863
No, no, not that close.

341
00:18:26.948 --> 00:18:29.824
As soon as I turned around,
he took off.


342
00:18:29.910 --> 00:18:35.622
But that could have been for
any number of reasons, right?


343
00:18:35.707 --> 00:18:39.668
Yeah. You're, uh...
You're making valid points.


344
00:18:39.753 --> 00:18:43.088
Well, you still want me
to make that call?


345
00:18:44.591 --> 00:18:46.091
Yes.

346
00:18:54.810 --> 00:18:56.351

Well, hello to you too.</i>

00:19:46.987 --> 00:19:48.695
Hi, James.

360
00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:51.072
Is, uh, is everything okay?

361
00:19:51.116 --> 00:19:52.323
<i>Yeah, yeah, I just...</i>

362
00:19:52.409 --> 00:19:54.868
I kept getting
this unknown number,


363
00:19:54.953 --> 00:19:58.246
and then when I answered,
no one was there and...


364
00:19:58.290 --> 00:20:02.125
You know what? Never mind.
Everything's fine.


365

<i>Good. Well, Mara is
out to dinner with Michael,</i>


366
00:20:05.964 --> 00:20:08.214
I am done returning
my client calls for the day,


367
00:20:08.258 --> 00:20:10.300
and it's just mom and I here.

368
00:20:10.385 --> 00:20:12.260
We were wondering
when you'd be coming home.


369
00:20:12.304 --> 00:20:13.720
I think she misses you already.

370
00:20:13.805 --> 00:20:16.723
Um, soon.

371
00:20:16.767 --> 00:20:19.058
Good. See you soon. Bye.

372
00:20:19.144 --> 00:20:20.602
Okay, bye.

373
00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:39.788
You can't be serious.

374
00:20:39.873 --> 00:20:41.539
It's not gonna be
for long, okay?


375
00:20:41.625 --> 00:20:43.416
Just a few months, Max.

376
00:20:43.502 --> 00:20:45.794
A few months? Mara,
I'm talking to two realtors


377
00:20:45.837 --> 00:20:48.713
who are looking for apartments
for us right now in l.A.


378
00:20:48.799 --> 00:20:51.090
Well, Michael, I don't know
what you want me to say, okay?


379
00:20:51.176 --> 00:20:53.635
I can't just leave her alone
right now.


380
00:20:53.678 --> 00:20:55.303
She's a grown woman who...

381
00:20:55.347 --> 00:20:56.846
Got the daylights
scared out of her


382
00:20:56.932 --> 00:20:59.182
by some maniac
at her spin class?


383
00:20:59.267 --> 00:21:02.060
Yeah, like a year ago.

384
00:21:05.774 --> 00:21:08.608
I'm sorry. Sorry.
I'm sure it was a bad time.


385
00:21:08.693 --> 00:21:10.944
You have no idea, okay?

386
00:21:11.029 --> 00:21:14.239
She was getting constant
phone calls every single day.


387
00:21:14.324 --> 00:21:17.283
This psychopath was leaving
these very disturbing messages,


388
00:21:17.369 --> 00:21:19.285
talking about
how they were soulmates


389
00:21:19.371 --> 00:21:20.765
and how they were meant
to be together


390
00:21:20.789 --> 00:21:23.122
and she should just
give into fate,


391
00:21:23.208 --> 00:21:24.833
calling her all the time,

392
00:21:24.876 --> 00:21:26.543
following her
everywhere she went, okay?


393
00:21:26.628 --> 00:21:28.169
He was popping up at places

394
00:21:28.213 --> 00:21:30.755
that she didn't even know
she was gonna be.


395
00:21:30.841 --> 00:21:34.092
I literally watched her
fall apart.


396
00:21:34.177 --> 00:21:36.719
Jesus, you never
talked about it much.


397
00:21:36.805 --> 00:21:38.972
I had no idea
it was that frightening.


398
00:21:39.057 --> 00:21:40.807
Frightening?

399
00:21:42.394 --> 00:21:45.311
The dude broke into our house.

400
00:21:45.397 --> 00:21:47.605
And... That's the night

401
00:21:47.691 --> 00:21:50.900
that she finally had
her mental breakdown.


402
00:21:50.986 --> 00:21:53.236
Were you there at the time?

403
00:21:53.321 --> 00:21:54.737
When my mom needed me the most,

404
00:21:54.823 --> 00:21:56.531
I was at some stupid
house party,


405
00:21:56.616 --> 00:21:58.283
playing beer pong.

406
00:21:58.368 --> 00:22:01.744
You know, if I would've
been there, who knows?


407
00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:03.830
Maybe I could've helped her
keep it together.


408
00:22:03.915 --> 00:22:06.875
Mara, you can't blame yourself
for that.


409
00:22:06.918 --> 00:22:09.502
Can't I? Just a little?

410
00:22:11.006 --> 00:22:15.383
I mean, I do feel responsible.

411
00:22:15.427 --> 00:22:17.468
That's why I've been
sleeping at home again.


412
00:22:19.097 --> 00:22:21.347
Yeah, don't remind me.

413
00:22:21.433 --> 00:22:25.727
Look, it's just gonna be
until things calm down, okay?


414
00:22:27.564 --> 00:22:31.608
So whatever happened to that
spin class stalker anyways?


415
00:22:31.693 --> 00:22:33.192
The police came,
they carted him away,


416
00:22:33.278 --> 00:22:35.236
but you know,
unfortunately by then,


417
00:22:35.322 --> 00:22:37.447
some real damage
had already been committed.


418
00:22:37.532 --> 00:22:41.993
And was she like committed?

419
00:22:42.078 --> 00:22:46.080
Yeah, briefly.
Just a couple of days.


420
00:22:46.166 --> 00:22:48.833
But since then,
she's just been getting by


421
00:22:48.919 --> 00:22:51.002
with support from
friends and family.


422
00:22:51.087 --> 00:22:54.881
Well, it's a good thing she
has a daughter like you then.


423
00:22:54.966 --> 00:22:57.258
James is a really big help too.

424
00:22:57.302 --> 00:22:59.844
Oh, yeah, I like James.

425
00:22:59.930 --> 00:23:01.846
Me too. I don't know.

426
00:23:01.932 --> 00:23:04.557
There was always something
different about him.


427
00:23:04.643 --> 00:23:06.454
You know, I couldn't quite
put my finger on it,


428
00:23:06.478 --> 00:23:10.563
but at least he's been a
positive force in my mom's life.


429
00:23:16.321 --> 00:23:17.445
Hey, Maggie.

430
00:23:18.990 --> 00:23:20.198
Kristen!

431
00:23:22.202 --> 00:23:27.038
You demolish
any marriages today?


432
00:23:27.123 --> 00:23:30.500
You know, three or four.
Usual amount.


433
00:23:30.585 --> 00:23:33.336
What are you doing?

434
00:23:33.421 --> 00:23:35.588
Solving the conflicts
in the middle east.


435
00:23:35.674 --> 00:23:37.924
It's a lot harder
than I thought.


436
00:23:38.009 --> 00:23:41.302
What does it look like
I'm doing?


437
00:23:41.346 --> 00:23:45.264
Playing solitaire.

438
00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:47.934
I guess I just meant,
"how's it going?"


439
00:23:49.562 --> 00:23:51.896
what did you say the name
of this game was again?


440
00:23:51.982 --> 00:23:53.940
Solitaire.

441
00:23:54.025 --> 00:23:58.945
And how many people
usually play it at one time?


442
00:23:59.030 --> 00:24:00.530
Just, just one.

443
00:24:00.615 --> 00:24:03.491
Huh. James said you were smart.

444
00:24:05.662 --> 00:24:07.203
Where is James?

445
00:24:07.288 --> 00:24:09.956
I'm not really sure.

446
00:24:10.041 --> 00:24:13.501
He's doing some errands
or something.


447
00:24:17.841 --> 00:24:21.342
What's wrong?
You're looking a little frantic.


448
00:24:21.428 --> 00:24:24.512
- No, I'm fine, it's...

449
00:24:30.895 --> 00:24:34.272

You're not gonna answer it?

451
00:24:37.235 --> 00:24:38.276
Hello.

00:24:42.907 --> 00:24:44.032
Hello.

453
00:24:47.746 --> 00:24:49.996
Hello?

454
00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:52.040
No one there?

455
00:24:52.125 --> 00:24:54.876
No, there's not.

456
00:24:59.257 --> 00:25:01.799
No, no, you don't. No!

457
00:25:01.885 --> 00:25:03.718
Where are you rushing off to?

458
00:25:06.723 --> 00:25:07.889
I saw you!

459
00:25:16.691 --> 00:25:18.024
Mara: Hey, mom, what's wrong?

460
00:25:18.068 --> 00:25:19.817
You hardly even touched
your food.


461
00:25:19.903 --> 00:25:22.445
Oh, yeah, don't mind me.

462
00:25:22.530 --> 00:25:25.740
I'm just a little stressed out
for some reason tonight.


463
00:25:25.784 --> 00:25:27.325
There's nothing wrong with that.

464
00:25:27.410 --> 00:25:30.495
No, no, of course not.

465
00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:33.915
Are you getting any more
of those calls


466
00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.876
that we were
talking about today?


467
00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:38.086
Are you?

468
00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:42.799
You know, I did.

469
00:25:42.884 --> 00:25:44.967
What calls
are they talking about?


470
00:25:45.053 --> 00:25:46.969
I get unknown callers
all the time.


471
00:25:47.055 --> 00:25:49.347
I mean, it could be anybody.
For all we know,


472
00:25:49.432 --> 00:25:52.100
it could be just
a super dedicated telemarketer.


473
00:25:52.143 --> 00:25:55.019
Yeah, I mean, it could be,

474
00:25:55.105 --> 00:25:56.874
except, you know,
a major part of telemarketing


475
00:25:56.898 --> 00:25:59.816
is actually talking to the
person you're trying to reach.


476
00:25:59.901 --> 00:26:02.485
I don't know.
I'm sure it's nothing.


477
00:26:02.570 --> 00:26:05.238
Well, if it's nothing,
why did your lovely new bride


478
00:26:05.323 --> 00:26:07.323
race out into the backyard
afterwards,


479
00:26:07.408 --> 00:26:10.451
like her pants
were on flippin' fire?


480
00:26:10.537 --> 00:26:12.537
Mom, you did?

481
00:26:12.622 --> 00:26:16.249
You did that, babe? Why?

482
00:26:16.334 --> 00:26:20.128
I... I thought I saw
somebody out there.


483
00:26:21.881 --> 00:26:22.922
And?

484
00:26:22.966 --> 00:26:24.298
And I was wrong.

485
00:26:26.386 --> 00:26:28.886
It's okay.
It's really okay, mom.


486
00:26:28.972 --> 00:26:30.888
Does all this
have something to do


487
00:26:30.974 --> 00:26:32.974
with your breakdown last year?

488
00:26:36.271 --> 00:26:40.481
James told me that you came
close to losing your marbles.


489
00:26:42.068 --> 00:26:44.026
I did not... I did not say that.

490
00:26:44.112 --> 00:26:45.778
Mom, would you please be...

491
00:26:45.864 --> 00:26:48.614
Interested in my
daughter-in-law's life?


492
00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:50.533
I thought that's the reason
why I came,


493
00:26:50.618 --> 00:26:53.286
was for all of us
to get to know each other.


494
00:26:53.329 --> 00:26:55.204
Well, you could be
a little nicer.


495
00:26:55.290 --> 00:26:57.707
And I could be from kalamazoo,
but I'm not.


496
00:26:57.792 --> 00:27:01.210
- [scoffs]
- I am who I am.


497
00:27:01.296 --> 00:27:03.796
One of the great benefits of
getting to know each other...


498
00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:05.840
And believe me
there aren't many...


499
00:27:05.884 --> 00:27:07.758
Is being able to say that

500
00:27:07.844 --> 00:27:10.970
and know for sure
that it's 100% true.


501
00:27:13.433 --> 00:27:17.852
Look, I'm sorry.

502
00:27:17.896 --> 00:27:21.480
I didn't come here
to be anyone's thorn,


503
00:27:21.566 --> 00:27:25.276
so if you want me to leave,
I will.


504
00:27:28.448 --> 00:27:31.449
No, no, Maggie, I...

505
00:27:31.534 --> 00:27:33.826
I wouldn't have that.

506
00:27:33.912 --> 00:27:35.119
We're, uh...

507
00:27:35.205 --> 00:27:36.954
We're family now, right?

508
00:27:39.167 --> 00:27:42.210
Do I have the greatest wife
or what?


509
00:27:45.215 --> 00:27:47.506
Oh, you know,
will you guys excuse me?


510
00:27:47.592 --> 00:27:49.592
- Mom...
- No, Mara, I'm fine.


511
00:27:49.677 --> 00:27:51.510
I just need to get
some fresh air.


512
00:27:51.596 --> 00:27:54.889
- Do you want me to...
- No, no. You guys just relax.


513
00:27:56.726 --> 00:27:58.392
I don't really blame her.

514
00:27:59.812 --> 00:28:02.396
It's a nice night out there.

515
00:28:18.248 --> 00:28:19.830
- Hey.
- Hey.


516
00:28:21.167 --> 00:28:24.085
- Maggie, she's, uh...
- [scoffs]


517
00:28:24.128 --> 00:28:25.419
She's sick, Mara.

518
00:28:25.505 --> 00:28:28.547
We should be pitying her,
not judging her.


519
00:28:28.633 --> 00:28:32.802
Well, we're not the one
looking down our noses.


520
00:28:32.887 --> 00:28:34.887
Look, mom, I know
that I keep asking you this,


521
00:28:34.973 --> 00:28:37.473
but are you okay?

522
00:28:37.558 --> 00:28:40.685
Yeah. Don't worry about me.

523
00:28:40.770 --> 00:28:42.728
That's not an answer.

524
00:28:42.814 --> 00:28:45.940
Okay, well, you know,
for you, it is.


525
00:28:46.025 --> 00:28:48.420
I know I'm the reason that you
put off your move with Michael.


526
00:28:48.444 --> 00:28:50.111
- Mom...
- No, Mara.


527
00:28:50.196 --> 00:28:52.530
I don't want you putting
your life on hold for me.


528
00:28:52.615 --> 00:28:55.908
Well, you know, I don't want you
back in that place.


529
00:29:00.123 --> 00:29:02.623
What do you say we go inside,
and you show me some yoga moves?


530
00:29:02.667 --> 00:29:04.166
Huh? What do you think?

531
00:29:04.252 --> 00:29:06.085
Kristen: Is it still cool
to say, "chill out?"


532
00:29:06.170 --> 00:29:07.503
[laughing]

533
00:29:07.588 --> 00:29:10.589
Mara: No, but I can show you
how to do that.


534
00:29:10.675 --> 00:29:13.467
Good. Tell me some words.

535
00:29:25.606 --> 00:29:27.064
Oh, hey.

536
00:29:27.150 --> 00:29:29.108
Listen, I wanted to thank you

537
00:29:29.193 --> 00:29:31.902
for making the john
handicap-friendly.


538
00:29:33.364 --> 00:29:36.198
Maybe you could, uh,
take a hint.


539
00:29:36.284 --> 00:29:38.075
Come again?

540
00:29:38.161 --> 00:29:42.371
Look, you could show a little
bit more kindness around here,


541
00:29:42.457 --> 00:29:43.998
okay?

542
00:29:44.042 --> 00:29:47.335
And as far as
the bathroom upgrade goes,


543
00:29:47.378 --> 00:29:49.253
you can thank your son for that.

544
00:29:49.339 --> 00:29:52.298
Yeah, but I'm talking to you,

545
00:29:52.342 --> 00:29:54.425
and it seems like
you have something to say.


546
00:29:56.220 --> 00:29:58.179
Is it about your mother?

547
00:29:59.932 --> 00:30:02.975
Maggie, my mom has done nothing
but show kindness to you,


548
00:30:03.061 --> 00:30:06.979
including giving you
a room and board.


549
00:30:07.065 --> 00:30:11.525
And you know, I see her
trying to make it work.


550
00:30:11.611 --> 00:30:15.613
She's not tough like you,
and you see that, so I'm just...


551
00:30:15.698 --> 00:30:17.490
Honestly, I'm really not sure

552
00:30:17.575 --> 00:30:20.034
why you have to make it
so hard on her.


553
00:30:20.119 --> 00:30:25.414
Well, you call it hard,
I call it helpful.


554
00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:28.709
The worst thing you can do
is indulge someone's fantasies


555
00:30:28.795 --> 00:30:33.506
when they're not
thinking straight.


556
00:30:33.591 --> 00:30:36.842
Fantasies?
You think she's enjoying this?


557
00:30:36.928 --> 00:30:40.554
Well, there you go,
using the dirty definition.


558
00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:43.432
But when you actually
break the word down,


559
00:30:43.518 --> 00:30:45.142
what it really means

560
00:30:45.228 --> 00:30:47.770
is that someone has seen
something that's not there,


561
00:30:47.855 --> 00:30:49.855
due to a psychological need.

562
00:30:49.941 --> 00:30:51.774
So what are you saying?

563
00:30:51.859 --> 00:30:54.568
I'm saying it's a good thing
she's seeing a head doctor.


564
00:30:54.612 --> 00:30:56.404
[chuckles] just saying.

565
00:30:58.783 --> 00:31:02.451
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

566
00:31:02.537 --> 00:31:06.497
I know how I can come off
sometimes,


567
00:31:06.582 --> 00:31:12.420
but maybe if you just try to see
the situation through my eyes,


568
00:31:12.505 --> 00:31:16.006
the way you're being protective
of your mother


569
00:31:16.092 --> 00:31:20.261
is kind of how I feel
about my son.


570
00:31:20.304 --> 00:31:24.390
And I might not be around
very much longer.


571
00:31:24.475 --> 00:31:28.310
In fact, it could be
sooner than later.


572
00:31:28.396 --> 00:31:32.148
So I, I guess I'm...

573
00:31:32.233 --> 00:31:34.275
I'm just trying to make sure

574
00:31:34.318 --> 00:31:38.737
that she can do what needs
to be done before I'm gone.


575
00:31:38.823 --> 00:31:42.658
I get it, I do. It's just...

576
00:31:42.743 --> 00:31:44.160
It's a lot.

577
00:31:44.245 --> 00:31:46.203
Yeah, so is a mother's love.

578
00:31:49.959 --> 00:31:52.126
[yawns]

579
00:31:53.963 --> 00:31:58.883
Well, it's time for me
to get to bed.


580
00:31:58.968 --> 00:32:01.302
You have a nice night now, okay?

581
00:32:02.513 --> 00:32:03.637
Night.

582
00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:14.398
[creaking]

583
00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:52.061
[gasping]

584
00:32:52.146 --> 00:32:55.314
Hey, hey, it's me, it's me.

585
00:32:55.399 --> 00:32:57.066
You... you had a bad dream.

586
00:32:57.151 --> 00:32:59.026
[panting]

587
00:32:59.111 --> 00:33:01.779
- Okay.
- You had a bad dream.


588
00:33:01.864 --> 00:33:04.198
Come here, come here.

589
00:33:04.283 --> 00:33:05.950
Oh, god.

590
00:33:06.035 --> 00:33:07.618
I'm so sorry.

591
00:33:09.330 --> 00:33:10.496
I'm so sorry.

592
00:33:38.442 --> 00:33:40.651
- Morning, boss.
- Morning.


593
00:33:40.736 --> 00:33:42.236
There you go.

594
00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:43.529
You look exhausted.

595
00:33:43.614 --> 00:33:46.824
Thanks, Steve. That was the look
I was going for.


596
00:33:46.909 --> 00:33:50.703
Did Rebecca Palmer confirm
for this morning?


597
00:33:50.746 --> 00:33:53.747
She should be here
in a few minutes.


598
00:33:53.791 --> 00:33:55.435
Great. Just enough time
to get caffeinated.


599
00:33:55.459 --> 00:33:56.645
Let me know when she arrives,
will ya?


600
00:33:56.669 --> 00:33:58.127
Sure thing.

601
00:33:58.212 --> 00:34:00.504
Oh, hey, I just spoke with
the building manager.


602
00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:02.298
Oh, what'd he say?

603
00:34:02.383 --> 00:34:04.925
Basically he said he follows
all the protocols in the book,


604
00:34:05.011 --> 00:34:06.780
but if you still like
to make a formal complaint,


605
00:34:06.804 --> 00:34:08.762
you're more than welcome.

606
00:34:08.848 --> 00:34:10.848
No, no, that's okay.

607
00:34:10.933 --> 00:34:13.225
I feel like I'm making
a mountain out of molehill,


608
00:34:13.311 --> 00:34:15.686
so let's just put it behind us.

609
00:34:15.771 --> 00:34:17.605
Sounds good to me.

610
00:34:34.665 --> 00:34:37.958
- Hey, Steve.
- Yeah?


611
00:34:38.002 --> 00:34:40.669
Did my husband drop by here?

612
00:34:40.755 --> 00:34:44.131
Um, not that I know of. Why?

613
00:35:00.733 --> 00:35:02.691
[clears throat] yes?

614
00:35:02.777 --> 00:35:04.151
Rebecca Palmer's here.

615
00:35:04.195 --> 00:35:06.779
Ah, thanks.

616
00:35:08.491 --> 00:35:10.491
You okay?

617
00:35:10.576 --> 00:35:13.661
Yeah, yeah.
Can you show her in, please?


618
00:35:13.746 --> 00:35:15.329
All right.

619
00:35:15.414 --> 00:35:17.873
It's great to see you.
How are you today?


620
00:35:17.958 --> 00:35:22.753
I am getting a big fat divorce.
How good can I really be?


621
00:35:22.838 --> 00:35:24.274
All right, well,
let me see if I can make that


622
00:35:24.298 --> 00:35:25.798
a little easier for you.

623
00:35:25.883 --> 00:35:28.467
Well, let me start with...

624
00:35:28.552 --> 00:35:31.470
[ringing]

625
00:35:31.555 --> 00:35:33.097
Sorry. I should
put this on silent.


626
00:35:33.182 --> 00:35:35.140
Yes, you should.

627
00:35:35.226 --> 00:35:37.059
It's been a bit hectic.

628
00:35:37.144 --> 00:35:38.704
My mother-in-law's
been staying with us.


629
00:35:38.729 --> 00:35:40.688
[buzzing]

630
00:35:40.731 --> 00:35:44.525
Looks like someone

She's probably
an ex-client by now.

I'm sorry that
that happened, Kristen,

650
00:36:48.424 --> 00:36:51.467
don't you think that's unlikely,

651

happening to someone twice?

Lucky me.
You know, two-time loser

and terrorize women.


654
00:36:58.934 --> 00:37:00.768
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves.


655
00:37:00.853 --> 00:37:02.936
Now start from the beginning.

656
00:37:03.022 --> 00:37:05.564
You received some calls
from an unknown number,


657
00:37:05.608 --> 00:37:07.608
and no one was
talking back to you.


658
00:37:07.651 --> 00:37:10.778
Right, and then there was
somebody who was following me


659
00:37:10.863 --> 00:37:15.032
in the parking lot at work
and then outside of my house.


660
00:37:15.117 --> 00:37:17.951
And now you received a rose

661
00:37:17.995 --> 00:37:20.287
that was left on
your office desk this morning?


662
00:37:20.372 --> 00:37:23.415
And a text asking me
if I liked it.


663
00:37:23.459 --> 00:37:24.750
Well, can I see that?

664
00:37:24.794 --> 00:37:26.126
Yeah.

665
00:37:27.421 --> 00:37:28.921
- Damn it.
- What?


666
00:37:28.964 --> 00:37:30.798
I forgot. I freaked out.

667
00:37:30.883 --> 00:37:32.319
When I saw the message,
I deleted it.


668
00:37:32.343 --> 00:37:33.217
That's okay.

669
00:37:33.302 --> 00:37:34.302
Oh, god.

I feel like I'm losing it again.

671
00:37:36.430 --> 00:37:38.972
Easy, easy.
Now, last time we sat down,


672
00:37:39.058 --> 00:37:41.308
you said you were under
extra pressure at home


673
00:37:41.393 --> 00:37:43.310
from your mother-in-law
moving in.


674
00:37:43.395 --> 00:37:46.063
Yeah, yeah, Maggie.

675
00:37:46.148 --> 00:37:48.148
I take it that's not going well.

676
00:37:48.192 --> 00:37:51.819
I mean, I get that she's sick,
you know,


677
00:37:51.904 --> 00:37:53.987
and so I'm trying
to just roll with it,


678
00:37:54.073 --> 00:37:57.282
but she is relentless
in her passive,


679
00:37:57.368 --> 00:38:00.244
not-so-passive aggression
towards me.


680
00:38:00.329 --> 00:38:01.829
And the timing on it all,

681
00:38:01.914 --> 00:38:04.331
it couldn't be more worse
with this new situation.


682
00:38:07.461 --> 00:38:09.419
Do you think
I'm going crazy again?


683
00:38:09.505 --> 00:38:12.506
A: You didn't last time,
and I don't like that word.


684
00:38:12.591 --> 00:38:14.383
And b: No.

685
00:38:14.468 --> 00:38:17.845
But I think you're pushed pretty
close to your limit right now.


686
00:38:17.930 --> 00:38:21.431
Now, how have you been sleeping?

687
00:38:21.517 --> 00:38:23.433
- Not great.
- So you're tired.


688

Your brain is playing
little tricks on you.


689
00:38:25.312 --> 00:38:26.687
And those phone calls,

690
00:38:26.730 --> 00:38:28.814
those could be
legitimate wrong numbers.


691

And the text
that I can't show you.

And the rose? That could be
James trying to surprise you.


693

You could have a secret admirer
out there somewhere,

00:43:50.554 --> 00:43:53.597
That's funny because I was about
to say the same thing about you.


789
00:43:53.682 --> 00:43:56.099
Ah, guilty as charged.

790
00:43:56.185 --> 00:43:58.935
Okay, okay, so I get it.

791
00:43:59.021 --> 00:44:02.772
Good con, bad con,
I get that whole thing.


792
00:44:02.858 --> 00:44:04.065
Why this lady?

793
00:44:04.151 --> 00:44:07.194
I came acRoss
this blog she wrote


794
00:44:07.279 --> 00:44:10.697
about her nervous breakdown
last year.


795
00:44:10.782 --> 00:44:14.075
Some lovestruck fool
breaks into her house


796
00:44:14.161 --> 00:44:16.703
and drives her crazy.

797
00:44:16.788 --> 00:44:21.416
So I hire this guy to help me
double down on it.


798
00:44:21.501 --> 00:44:24.544
Yeah. Once we have her
committed,


799
00:44:24.630 --> 00:44:27.714
I'll be in complete control
of her finances.


800
00:44:27.799 --> 00:44:29.549
Won't take long.
We'll have it transferred


801
00:44:29.635 --> 00:44:32.219
to an offshore account
in the caribbean.


802
00:44:32.304 --> 00:44:34.304
And what about
the lady's daughter?


803
00:44:34.389 --> 00:44:37.682
That's why we're here.

804
00:44:37.768 --> 00:44:41.144
The little brat
is getting real protective.


805
00:44:41.230 --> 00:44:45.565
She'll get rid of us soon
if we don't get this done.


806
00:44:45.651 --> 00:44:49.402
And chances are
she'll be successful,


807
00:44:49.488 --> 00:44:53.907
so we gotta do this thing
tonight.


808
00:44:53.992 --> 00:44:55.408
Right, son?

809
00:44:55.494 --> 00:44:57.661
Right, ma.

810
00:45:06.004 --> 00:45:08.171
Mom, yoga's supposed
to relax you,


811
00:45:08.257 --> 00:45:10.507
not stress you out more.

812
00:45:12.803 --> 00:45:15.762
You and Michael are supposed to
be leaving for l.A. Next week.


813
00:45:15.847 --> 00:45:18.431
The move has been pushed back
a few months, that's all.


814
00:45:18.475 --> 00:45:20.684
No, you mean your life is
being delayed because of me.


815
00:45:20.769 --> 00:45:24.813
No, because there's been a lot
of changes around here lately.


816
00:45:24.898 --> 00:45:26.439
Sweetheart, I'm gonna be fine.

817
00:45:26.525 --> 00:45:28.149
I mean, I know
Maggie can be tough,


818
00:45:28.235 --> 00:45:30.318
but I've got James
to help me handle her.


819
00:45:30.404 --> 00:45:32.153
And he really does love me.

820
00:45:32.239 --> 00:45:33.780
I know.

821
00:45:33.865 --> 00:45:36.199
He would never do anything
to hurt me.


822
00:45:36.285 --> 00:45:38.201
Yeah.

823
00:45:38.287 --> 00:45:40.036
Come on, let's take a break.
I'm dying.


824
00:45:40.122 --> 00:45:41.122
Okay.

825
00:45:43.125 --> 00:45:45.333
Your job's done here, Max.

826
00:45:45.419 --> 00:45:47.460
It's time for you
to get outta dodge.


827
00:45:55.762 --> 00:45:57.595
Looks a little light.

828
00:45:57.681 --> 00:46:00.181
I told you the deal
when I hired you.


829
00:46:00.267 --> 00:46:03.977
You get the rest
when we all get ours.


830
00:46:13.155 --> 00:46:16.698
Fine, then I want to be there
tonight when it all goes down


831
00:46:16.783 --> 00:46:18.803
'cause otherwise this whole
thing has felt like a tease.


832
00:46:18.827 --> 00:46:22.495
Nah, that's a bad idea.

833
00:46:22.581 --> 00:46:24.956
See, first, you don't know
the layout of the house.


834
00:46:25.042 --> 00:46:29.336
And second, you are a little too
stimulated by this whole thing.


835
00:46:29.421 --> 00:46:32.213
And I haven't been pushing
that flippin' walker


836
00:46:32.299 --> 00:46:34.674
for my health either.

837
00:46:34.718 --> 00:46:40.305
I need to push this snowflake
over the edge tonight,


838
00:46:40.390 --> 00:46:46.353
and she cannot know that
I am physically capable of it.


839
00:46:46.438 --> 00:46:50.398
So you can't be
anywhere near the house.


840
00:46:50.484 --> 00:46:54.527
In fact, I don't even want you
in the same state.


841
00:46:56.490 --> 00:46:58.740
Okay.

842
00:46:58.825 --> 00:47:00.909
Then I'm gonna need
some more money.


843
00:47:00.994 --> 00:47:05.205
Upfront.
Not this when and if thing.


844
00:47:05.290 --> 00:47:07.290
I'm talking about right now.

845
00:47:07.376 --> 00:47:08.458
Ohh...

846
00:47:10.212 --> 00:47:12.712
You gotta be
flippin' kidding me.


847
00:47:12.798 --> 00:47:14.756
It's like my drunk daddy
used to say:


848
00:47:14.841 --> 00:47:17.884
"A little leverage
is better than any beverage."


849
00:47:23.016 --> 00:47:25.350
huh? What do you say?

850
00:47:25.435 --> 00:47:27.727
Should we go to an atm or what?

851
00:47:27.813 --> 00:47:30.271
'Cause you don't want to go back
to prison, I know that.


852
00:47:30.357 --> 00:47:35.235
And you do not want me
telling people what I know.


853
00:47:39.157 --> 00:47:42.242
Okay, Max, you win.

854
00:47:43.453 --> 00:47:45.578
Finish your drink,

855
00:47:45.664 --> 00:47:48.957
and we'll go get you your money.

856

860
00:48:00.887 --> 00:48:04.472
So you two, you two
ain't angry at me, right?


861
00:48:04.558 --> 00:48:06.558
Of course not, Max.

862
00:48:06.601 --> 00:48:08.935
Good, 'cause you'd do the same
you were me, right?


863
00:48:09.020 --> 00:48:10.854
Of course I would.

864
00:48:10.939 --> 00:48:13.440
'Cause we're all just
terrible people, right?


865
00:48:13.525 --> 00:48:15.442
When we have to be.

Okay, mom.

Uh, good night.

872
00:49:51.331 --> 00:49:53.414
Sleep tight.

873
00:49:53.500 --> 00:49:55.833
Hey, honey,

874
00:49:55.919 --> 00:49:58.044
thank you for everything.

875
00:49:58.129 --> 00:49:59.462
I mean it.

876
00:49:59.548 --> 00:50:03.716
Uh, thank you, Maggie.
That means a lot to me.


877
00:50:15.730 --> 00:50:18.231
I'm going to bed. 
I'm exhausted.

878

Ah, me too.

879
00:50:20.569 --> 00:50:23.444
Yeah. Well, see you
in the morning, okay?


880
00:50:23.530 --> 00:50:25.947
I'll be out before my head
hits the pillow.

I can't believe your mom
was actually nice to me tonight.


890
00:52:51.010 --> 00:52:53.469
I told you.

891
00:52:53.555 --> 00:52:55.763
She really likes you.

Hmm.

Yeah, you know, I'm gonna make
more of an effort with her.

That's incredible,

considering that she hasn't even
met you halfway.

00:58:22.258 --> 00:58:23.507
<i>in a mental hospital,</i>

948
00:58:23.593 --> 00:58:24.925
even for a few days.

949
00:58:25.011 --> 00:58:27.136
- It was a close call.
- <i>I know.</i>


950
00:58:27.221 --> 00:58:29.263
She needs a lot of help, Denise.

951
00:58:29.348 --> 00:58:31.265
I know.

952
00:58:31.350 --> 00:58:33.809
<i>Well, she's gonna be evaluated
again next week by the state,</i>


953
00:58:33.895 --> 00:58:35.456
but I'm feeling pretty confident
we should get her home


954
00:58:35.480 --> 00:58:36.645
by the end of the month.

955
00:58:36.731 --> 00:58:38.564
From your mouth to god's ears.

956
00:58:38.649 --> 00:58:40.316
Actually, from your mouth.

957
00:58:40.401 --> 00:58:41.920
You're the one that talks them
through these things.


958
00:58:41.944 --> 00:58:43.527
I just give them
a place to stay.


959
00:58:43.613 --> 00:58:45.321
- And bless you for that.
- [knocking]


960
00:58:47.116 --> 00:58:49.992
Oh, um, Cheryl, I gotta go.

961
00:58:50.078 --> 00:58:51.952
I'll check with you later.

962
00:58:52.038 --> 00:58:53.245
Hi.

963
00:58:54.624 --> 00:58:55.831
Damn it!

964
00:58:55.917 --> 00:58:58.084
- Will you calm down?
- Calm down?


965
00:58:58.169 --> 00:59:01.504
Where did this halfway house
for crazies come from?


966
00:59:01.589 --> 00:59:03.589
They were supposed
to to commit her.


967
00:59:03.674 --> 00:59:06.217
Yeah, and you are the one
that said they would do that.


968
00:59:06.302 --> 00:59:08.594
Oh, damn it. All right.

969
00:59:08.679 --> 00:59:11.430
I say we find a way to
take her out while she's there.


970
00:59:11.474 --> 00:59:13.682
You're the husband.
You should get the money.


971
00:59:13.768 --> 00:59:17.103
We are crooks.
We're not murderers.


972
00:59:17.146 --> 00:59:18.896
And sometimes we do both.

973
00:59:18.940 --> 00:59:21.607
Or did I just dream about
what happened at that bar,


974
00:59:21.651 --> 00:59:22.608
mr. Stabby?

975
00:59:22.652 --> 00:59:24.110
That was necessary.

976
00:59:24.153 --> 00:59:25.778
This is not.

977
00:59:25.822 --> 00:59:27.238
<i>Denise: I'm sorry I have to ask,</i>

978
00:59:27.281 --> 00:59:29.573
but this second stalker,

979
00:59:29.659 --> 00:59:32.076
you think this is like
a real thing?


980
00:59:32.161 --> 00:59:34.662
I don't know, but they can't
find any evidence


981
00:59:34.747 --> 00:59:37.123
of someone breaking in
or leaving the house,


982
00:59:37.208 --> 00:59:40.042
so all I know is that my mom
was doing a lot better


983
00:59:40.128 --> 00:59:41.710
before Maggie got here.

984
00:59:41.796 --> 00:59:44.839
The timing of all this
could be coincidental, but...


985
00:59:44.924 --> 00:59:48.259
Well, do you have any pictures
of James and his mother?


986
00:59:48.302 --> 00:59:51.220
Actually, yeah, I do.

987
00:59:51.305 --> 00:59:52.555
Text it to me, will you?

988
00:59:52.640 --> 00:59:53.722
Yeah.

989
01:00:07.947 --> 01:00:10.072
Maggie: You know,
you got me confused again.


990
01:00:10.158 --> 01:00:12.158
One more time.

991
01:00:12.201 --> 01:00:15.119
Did you come into
this woman's life to love her


992
01:00:15.163 --> 01:00:17.496
or to rob her?

993
01:00:17.540 --> 01:00:21.167
Don't worry about me.
I'm a pro, okay?


994
01:00:21.210 --> 01:00:23.669
But we do not need
to hurt these people.


995
01:00:23.754 --> 01:00:26.338
Let's say that I agree with you.

996
01:00:26.424 --> 01:00:28.485
There are too many other people
in that support house.


997
01:00:28.509 --> 01:00:30.426
We don't even know
the floor plan.


998
01:00:30.511 --> 01:00:32.469
All right, fine.

999
01:00:32.555 --> 01:00:36.223
But if I see you
siding with them instead of us,


1000
01:00:36.309 --> 01:00:38.309
all bets are off.

1001
01:00:38.394 --> 01:00:40.603
All right, big shot,

1002
01:00:40.688 --> 01:00:42.646
so what in the hell
do we do now?


1003
01:00:42.732 --> 01:00:45.107
We wait till
she comes back here,


1004
01:00:45.193 --> 01:00:47.151
and we turn up the gas.

1005
01:00:47.236 --> 01:00:50.112
Damn it!
You gotta be kidding me.


1006
01:00:50.198 --> 01:00:52.406
And what do we do with Mara
in the meantime?


1007
01:00:52.491 --> 01:00:55.951
I don't know.
Maybe it's time that we try


1008
01:00:56.037 --> 01:00:58.037
Max's killing with kindness
routine.


1009
01:00:59.582 --> 01:01:02.875
Fine, as long as
she's not on to us.


1010
01:01:02.919 --> 01:01:07.004
Question is, what are you
prepared to do if she is?


1011
01:01:09.258 --> 01:01:10.925
[knocking]

1012
01:01:11.010 --> 01:01:12.134
Yes?

1013
01:01:12.220 --> 01:01:13.594
It's me.

1014
01:01:13.679 --> 01:01:15.012
Come in.

1015
01:01:15.097 --> 01:01:17.723
Do you see what I did?
I called first,


1016
01:01:17.767 --> 01:01:20.434
so I guess you can teach
an old dog new tricks.


1017
01:01:20.519 --> 01:01:22.603
I'll keep that in mind.

1018
01:01:22.688 --> 01:01:27.858
But what if I need you
for some of your old tricks?


1019
01:01:27.944 --> 01:01:30.945
Oh, a real dog doesn't forget
the old stuff. What do you got?


1020
01:01:31.030 --> 01:01:33.239
If I text you some pictures,

1021
01:01:33.324 --> 01:01:35.699
you think you can find out
about a couple of people?


1022
01:01:35.785 --> 01:01:37.493
I mean, I'll owe you one.

1023
01:01:37.578 --> 01:01:41.413
And considering
what you owe me...


1024
01:01:41.457 --> 01:01:42.915
Well, I don't mind you
owing me one.


1025
01:01:42.959 --> 01:01:45.251
Those are some of
my favorite nights, Denise.


1026
01:01:45.336 --> 01:01:48.003
Don't start.

1027
01:01:48.089 --> 01:01:51.090
All right. Text me the pics.
I'll get right on 'em.


1028
01:02:06.649 --> 01:02:08.440
"Maybe dangerous
or even life-threatening."


1029
01:02:08.484 --> 01:02:11.318
Family history
may increase likelihood.


1030
01:02:11.404 --> 01:02:14.238
In some cases, a combination
of medications can work better.


1031
01:02:14.323 --> 01:02:18.284
"Anyone with this disease will
need lifelong insulin therapy."


1032
01:03:43.454 --> 01:03:46.080
you need something?

1033
01:03:46.165 --> 01:03:49.333
No. No, sorry, um...
My toilet's clogged,


1034
01:03:49.418 --> 01:03:51.377
so I just figured
I would use the one in here.


1035
01:03:51.420 --> 01:03:52.669
Do you mind?

1036
01:03:52.713 --> 01:03:55.756
Mind? It's your house, girlie.

1037
01:03:55.841 --> 01:03:58.217
You can tinkle
anywhere you like.


1038
01:03:58.302 --> 01:04:00.719
Tinkle? That's funny.

1039
01:04:00.805 --> 01:04:02.888
I'll catch you later, Maggie.

1040
01:04:13.109 --> 01:04:14.586
Michael: You sure don't
want me to come?


1041
01:04:14.610 --> 01:04:16.527
I know how hard
this must be on you.


1042
01:04:16.570 --> 01:04:20.572
It's a cakewalk compared
to what she's going through.


1043
01:04:20.616 --> 01:04:24.410
Thank you for driving me.
I'm just a little shaky.


1044
01:04:24.495 --> 01:04:27.746
Anybody would be.
James didn't want to come?


1045
01:04:27.832 --> 01:04:30.874
I didn't tell him I was coming.

1046
01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:34.545
I just... I want to talk to her
about last night, alone.


1047
01:04:34.630 --> 01:04:36.505
I know that you like James.

1048
01:04:36.590 --> 01:04:39.091
Hey, mar, I barely know the guy.

1049
01:04:39.135 --> 01:04:40.717
And quite honestly,

1050
01:04:40.803 --> 01:04:43.220
nothing's been the same
ever since his mom moved in.


1051
01:04:43.305 --> 01:04:47.933
- Yeah. Speaking of mothers...
- Good luck in there.


1052
01:04:56.610 --> 01:04:58.444
- You must be Mara.
- Cheryl.


1053
01:04:58.487 --> 01:05:00.154
- Come on in.
- How's she doing?


1054
01:05:00.239 --> 01:05:02.322
She's a little out of it
because of the medication,


1055
01:05:02.408 --> 01:05:04.575
but better overall
than you're probably thinking.


1056
01:05:04.660 --> 01:05:06.577
Okay. Has she talked about
what happened?


1057
01:05:06.662 --> 01:05:09.204
No, but she hasn't said much
of anything since she got here.


1058
01:05:09.290 --> 01:05:12.166
Something tells me she'll be
really happy to see you.


1059
01:05:12.251 --> 01:05:14.626
Kristen, you have a visitor.

1060
01:05:14.712 --> 01:05:15.961
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hi, mom.


1061
01:05:16.005 --> 01:05:17.671
Cheryl: I'll let you two
catch up.


1062
01:05:17.756 --> 01:05:19.651
I'll be in the kitchen
if you need me for anything.


1063
01:05:19.675 --> 01:05:21.717
- Thanks, Cheryl.
- Mm-hmm.


1064
01:05:21.802 --> 01:05:25.304
Honey, I'm okay, okay? I'm fine.

1065
01:05:25.389 --> 01:05:27.473
Really, I just...
I had a bad night.


1066
01:05:27.558 --> 01:05:29.516
- I'm so sorry.
- No.


1067
01:05:29.602 --> 01:05:31.852
I can't believe
I slept through it again.


1068
01:05:31.937 --> 01:05:33.020
I let you down again.

1069
01:05:33.105 --> 01:05:35.647
No, no, you didn't.

1070
01:05:35.691 --> 01:05:37.983
And I am not sorry, okay?

1071
01:05:38.068 --> 01:05:41.487
I don't like
when you see me like that.


1072
01:05:41.572 --> 01:05:44.072
Can you tell me what happened?

1073
01:05:44.158 --> 01:05:45.657
Yeah.

1074
01:05:48.829 --> 01:05:51.705
I woke up because
I thought I heard something,


1075
01:05:51.790 --> 01:05:56.043
but then I listened,
and there was nothing there,


1076
01:05:56.128 --> 01:05:58.045
so I...

1077
01:05:58.130 --> 01:06:01.089
I tried to go back to sleep,
but I couldn't,


1078
01:06:01.175 --> 01:06:04.051
and so I figured
I would just go online,


1079
01:06:04.136 --> 01:06:07.763
and I realized that my phone
was in the kitchen,


1080
01:06:07.848 --> 01:06:10.682
so I went downstairs,

1081
01:06:10.726 --> 01:06:13.477
and I saw that the door
was open,


1082
01:06:13.562 --> 01:06:15.229
so I
-I called 911,

1083
01:06:15.314 --> 01:06:18.398
and then I-I went
into the entryway,


1084
01:06:18.484 --> 01:06:21.318
and he darted past me.

1085
01:06:21.403 --> 01:06:23.153
So you actually saw someone?

1086
01:06:23.197 --> 01:06:25.697
I think so. I...

1087
01:06:25.783 --> 01:06:28.951
I mean, there was
this shadow, at least.


1088
01:06:29.036 --> 01:06:30.494
Mara, I swear to you.

1089
01:06:30.579 --> 01:06:32.496
Trust me, there was somebody
in there with me.


1090
01:06:32.540 --> 01:06:34.665
I believe you.

1091
01:06:34.708 --> 01:06:36.645
You know, is there any way
that the person you saw


1092
01:06:36.669 --> 01:06:38.710
could have been James or Maggie?

1093
01:06:38.796 --> 01:06:41.088
No. James was asleep,

1094
01:06:41.173 --> 01:06:43.382
and Maggie can't even
get around.


1095
01:06:43.467 --> 01:06:44.841
She couldn't have done that.

1096
01:06:44.927 --> 01:06:48.595
So either I do have
a new guy following me,


1097
01:06:48.681 --> 01:06:50.389
which like there's
no evidence of,


1098
01:06:50.432 --> 01:06:51.557
except my word.

1099
01:06:53.686 --> 01:06:56.436

1253
01:17:27.861 --> 01:17:29.338
I was gonna make
a quick sandwich first.


1254
01:17:29.362 --> 01:17:31.029
This is you worrying?

1255
01:17:58.975 --> 01:18:01.726
- [muffled screaming]
- shh! Go to sleep, kid.


1256
01:18:01.770 --> 01:18:03.478
Go to sleep.

1257
01:18:51.486 --> 01:18:54.570
Where the hell are you?
We gotta hit the road!


1258
01:18:55.657 --> 01:18:57.115
[gasps] you can walk.

1259
01:19:00.787 --> 01:19:02.578
It's a miracle.

1260
01:19:02.622 --> 01:19:06.541
It was you.
You and James the entire time,


1261
01:19:06.626 --> 01:19:08.876
messing with my mom,
making her crazy.


1262
01:19:08.962 --> 01:19:12.839
First of all, girlie,
that's not our names.


1263
01:19:12.924 --> 01:19:16.592
And second, it didn't really
take that much effort.


1264
01:19:16.678 --> 01:19:21.097
Only problem was
we didn't go far enough.


1265
01:19:21.141 --> 01:19:23.683
But those days are over.

1266
01:19:23.768 --> 01:19:25.560
What do you mean?

1267
01:19:25.645 --> 01:19:29.814
Why did you have
to come back tonight?


1268
01:19:29.899 --> 01:19:31.357
Get away from her!

1269
01:19:31.443 --> 01:19:33.276
It's too late for that.

1270
01:19:33.320 --> 01:19:35.028
No, it's not!

1271
01:19:35.113 --> 01:19:37.613
We're gonna tie her up,
and we're gonna get in the car,


1272
01:19:37.699 --> 01:19:39.510
and you and I will be drinking
margaritas on the beach


1273
01:19:39.534 --> 01:19:41.951
in mexico before
anybody knows about this.


1274
01:19:41.995 --> 01:19:43.786
Who put you in charge?

1275
01:19:43.872 --> 01:19:46.247
I have made myself clear
from the start, jackie!


1276
01:19:46.333 --> 01:19:48.291
I do not want
either one of them hurt.


1277
01:19:48.335 --> 01:19:51.085
And I've made myself clear!
I'm not going back to prison!


1278
01:19:53.298 --> 01:19:54.797
Oh, now look what you did!

1279
01:19:54.883 --> 01:19:57.175
- I'll get her.
- You idiot!


1280
01:20:23.119 --> 01:20:24.202
Mara?

1281
01:20:26.414 --> 01:20:28.373
Mara!

1282
01:20:28.416 --> 01:20:32.043
Come on. I'm trying to help you.

1283
01:20:36.841 --> 01:20:38.674
Michael! Michael!

1284
01:20:41.262 --> 01:20:43.846
Michael! Michael! Michael!

1285
01:20:43.932 --> 01:20:46.182
Michael, wake up, wake up.
We gotta go.


1286
01:20:46.267 --> 01:20:48.101
- What?
- Wake up, wake up.


1287
01:20:48.186 --> 01:20:51.229
Looks like your boo
got himself a boo-boo.


1288
01:20:51.272 --> 01:20:53.398
Stand up, girlie.

1289
01:20:54.567 --> 01:20:55.733
Real slow.

1290
01:20:58.988 --> 01:21:00.613
You know, it's a shame.

1291
01:21:00.698 --> 01:21:05.034
There's something about
your spirit I kinda like,


1292
01:21:05.120 --> 01:21:07.203
even if you were
a pain in my ass


1293
01:21:07.288 --> 01:21:09.414
at every flippin' turn.

1294
01:21:09.499 --> 01:21:10.998
- Mara!
- Mom!


1295
01:21:11.084 --> 01:21:13.251
Get away from her!

1296
01:21:13.294 --> 01:21:15.878
Ah, finally something
goes right on this job.


1297
01:21:15.964 --> 01:21:18.089
Enough! [Groans]

1298
01:21:18.133 --> 01:21:20.883
You flippin' fool!
Why did you do that?


1299
01:21:20.927 --> 01:21:21.927
[distant sirens]

1300
01:21:22.011 --> 01:21:25.555
Screw this family!

1301
01:21:25.640 --> 01:21:30.685
[sirens approaching]

1302
01:21:30.770 --> 01:21:32.186
Mom, what are you doing here?

1303
01:21:32.272 --> 01:21:34.230
Oh, god!
I heard you were in trouble.


1304
01:21:34.315 --> 01:21:37.150
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay, I'm okay.


1305
01:21:37.235 --> 01:21:39.152
What the hell happened here?

1306
01:21:39.237 --> 01:21:42.155
It was... it was Maggie.

1307
01:21:42.240 --> 01:21:44.782
Mom, that's not her name.

1308
01:21:44.826 --> 01:21:45.992
It's jackie.

1309
01:21:46.077 --> 01:21:47.743
Well, where's jackie now?

1310
01:21:47.829 --> 01:21:50.121
She left the house.

1311
01:21:53.960 --> 01:21:55.126
Come here.

1312
01:22:01.342 --> 01:22:03.217
I'm so glad you two are here.

1313
01:22:03.303 --> 01:22:05.803
We are, too, believe me.

1314
01:22:05.847 --> 01:22:09.807
Yeah. We kinda need to get out
of the house these days anyways.


1315
01:22:09.851 --> 01:22:12.560
Mara's putting her plans on hold
a little while longer,


1316
01:22:12.645 --> 01:22:15.605
but this time
I'm not complaining.


1317
01:22:15.648 --> 01:22:17.106
Neither is my boyfriend.

1318
01:22:17.192 --> 01:22:18.733
He's being a saint
about all of this.


1319
01:22:18.818 --> 01:22:21.903
Oh, I hear that.

1320
01:22:21.988 --> 01:22:24.614
Denise, I'm so sorry
about your ex's passing.


1321
01:22:24.699 --> 01:22:25.781
You mean his murder.

1322
01:22:25.825 --> 01:22:28.826
Oh, imagine how sorry you'd feel

1323
01:22:28.870 --> 01:22:30.620
if you were the reason
that he's dead.


1324
01:22:30.663 --> 01:22:32.705
Come on, don't say that.

1325
01:22:32.790 --> 01:22:36.250
I'm not. It's true, whether
I say it out loud or not.


1326
01:22:36.336 --> 01:22:40.296
Have the police been able
to tell you anything else?


1327
01:22:40.381 --> 01:22:44.509
Well, um, James's real name is
paul northcutt.


1328
01:22:46.888 --> 01:22:50.431
I know this sounds crazy,
but he was...


1329
01:22:50.517 --> 01:22:52.350
Conning you out
of every dime you had, mom.


1330
01:22:52.393 --> 01:22:55.770
Okay, yes, Mara, he was,
but he also saved my life.


1331
01:22:55.855 --> 01:22:57.772
Mm-hmm.

1332
01:22:57.857 --> 01:22:59.774
I mean, he couldn't have been
all that bad.


1333
01:22:59.859 --> 01:23:01.692
And, um, Maggie?

1334
01:23:01.778 --> 01:23:04.820
- You mean jackie turner?
- Yes.


1335
01:23:04.906 --> 01:23:08.574
According to Ross' guy,
she's been arrested a few times,


1336
01:23:08.660 --> 01:23:12.828
mostly for short-term cons
with James and some with others.


1337
01:23:12.914 --> 01:23:16.499
But she's a lot more dangerous
than her rap sheet hinted at.


1338
01:23:16.584 --> 01:23:18.876
And we have no idea
where she is now.


1339
01:23:18.920 --> 01:23:20.628
I'm sure she's still out there,

1340
01:23:20.713 --> 01:23:23.839
just running the same game
on another unsuspecting family.


1341
01:23:23.925 --> 01:23:26.008
She can't hide forever.

1342
01:23:29.597 --> 01:23:33.224
- Would you look at this place?
- It's enormous.


1343
01:23:35.770 --> 01:23:38.688
You're looking a little nervous.
Are you all right?


1344
01:23:38.731 --> 01:23:42.149
Maybe I am. A little.

1345
01:23:42.235 --> 01:23:44.777
I need this to go right.

1346
01:23:44.862 --> 01:23:47.196
Don't worry, honey. Mama's here.

1347
01:23:47.282 --> 01:23:52.118
I'm gonna make sure
that man in there is yours.


1348
01:23:52.203 --> 01:23:53.995
All yours. And soon.

1349
01:23:55.039 --> 01:23:56.998
Okay.

1350
01:24:02.630 --> 01:24:04.088
[doorbell rings]

1351
01:24:10.638 --> 01:24:12.555
- Hi, I'm Stephanie.
- I'm Bridget.


1352
01:24:12.640 --> 01:24:16.350
- Yes, landon's mentioned you.
- He's mentioned you as well.


1353
01:24:16.436 --> 01:24:18.436
This is my mother, Christine.

1354
01:24:18.479 --> 01:24:19.562
- Hi.
- Hello.


1355
01:24:19.647 --> 01:24:21.606
Please, come on in.

1356
01:24:23.026 --> 01:24:25.610
And I'm gonna go get landon
for you.


1357
01:24:27.238 --> 01:24:28.779
Make yourselves at home.

1358
01:24:28.865 --> 01:24:31.532
Don't have to tell us twice.

1359
01:24:37.782 --> 01:24:47.782
