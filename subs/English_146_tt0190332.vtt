1
00:01:05.305 --> 00:01:08.725
Oh, it's Lǐ. Lǐ is here!

2
00:01:08.976 --> 00:01:10.309
Lǐ Mùbái is here!

3
00:01:22.948 --> 00:01:26.159
Xiùlián!

4
00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.456
Xiùlián! Lǐ Mùbái is here!

5
00:01:37.004 --> 00:01:38.755
MAN: Welcome back, Master Lǐ.
LĬ MÙBÁI: Thank you.


6
00:01:39.173 --> 00:01:40.214
How is everything?

7
00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:41.924
WOMAN: Fine, fine. 
Please come in.

8
00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.230
I cannot believe you are here. 
How long it has been.

9
00:01:56.315 --> 00:01:57.482
Ages.

10
00:01:57.566 --> 00:01:59.025
You've been handling a lot of freight?

11
00:01:59.151 --> 00:02:00.568
Enough. And how are you?

12
00:02:01.028 --> 00:02:02.195
Well.

13
00:02:06.492 --> 00:02:09.035
Brother Zheng came by and said he
saw you on the mountain at Wudang.

14
00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.746
That you were studying deep meditation.

15
00:02:13.999 --> 00:02:15.708
It must be so relaxing.

16
00:02:15.876 --> 00:02:17.585
I'm so envious - you've no idea.

17
00:02:17.669 --> 00:02:20.838
My work keeps me so busy, 
I can hardly get a moment's rest.

18
00:02:23.008 --> 00:02:24.258
I broke training.

19
00:02:24.343 --> 00:02:26.052
Or rather, withdrew.

20
00:02:27.221 --> 00:02:30.723
What? But I always thought
discipline was everything in Wudang.

21
00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:37.563
One day, during meditation training, 
I rose to a plain where there was utter silence.

22
00:02:38.607 --> 00:02:40.733
I was bathed in light.

23
00:02:41.443 --> 00:02:44.403
And suddenly, time and space did not exist. 
Only absolute radiance.

24
00:02:45.781 --> 00:02:49.867
So wonderful, I could not understand why the master had not shared it. 
And then I felt...

25
00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:53.830
Enlightened.

26
00:02:53.956 --> 00:02:55.498
No, because I did not sense

27
00:02:56.041 --> 00:02:59.460
the overwhelming bliss that one should feel.

28
00:02:59.545 --> 00:03:03.923
I felt that it was
something like despair, but greater.

29
00:03:05.384 --> 00:03:08.094
An immense sorrow so intense, 
I could not take it.

30
00:03:08.887 --> 00:03:12.014
I could not go on. I failed.

31
00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.811
Something was saying, return to *Mierti.

32
00:03:18.438 --> 00:03:19.897
Something?

33
00:03:23.068 --> 00:03:25.319
That I do not wish to let die.

34
00:03:29.366 --> 00:03:31.534
Why so many men?

35
00:03:32.119 --> 00:03:36.080
We are about to go to Beijing. 
To escort Xingyang's yearly shipment of silk.

36
00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.793
I wonder if I could ask you
to deliver something for me to Bèi-lèyé.

37
00:03:46.133 --> 00:03:49.260
The Green Destiny? 
You're giving it to Bèi-lèyé?

38
00:03:49.344 --> 00:03:52.889
Yes. Bèi-lèyé has always been our greatest protector.

39
00:03:52.973 --> 00:03:55.933
You cannot do it, Mu Bai. 
That sword is like your brother.

40
00:03:56.018 --> 00:03:58.394
It's been a part of you forever.

41
00:03:59.563 --> 00:04:02.148
This sword has taken more
than its share of lives.

42
00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.362
It looks innocent, doesn't it?

43
00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.240
With no traces of blood on it.

44
00:04:11.325 --> 00:04:15.202
But its heart is pure. 
It needs the master it belongs to.

45
00:04:17.706 --> 00:04:19.999
I need to end this kind of life.

46
00:04:21.043 --> 00:04:23.502
Then it's... over?

47
00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.591
I know what, come with me to Beijing.

48
00:04:28.967 --> 00:04:31.928
It would be nicer to
hand it personally to Bèi-lèyé.

49
00:04:32.054 --> 00:04:34.680
Remember the early days
in Beijing with Master Pen.

50
00:04:36.308 --> 00:04:39.727
I can never forget. 
It's now 10 years since he was...

51
00:04:40.562 --> 00:04:44.231
killed by Bìyǎn Húli.

52
00:04:44.316 --> 00:04:46.609
To this day, she has never been punished.

53
00:04:46.735 --> 00:04:49.070
Yet here I am, seriously thinking of withdrawing.

54
00:04:49.696 --> 00:04:52.114
I will kneel at
Pen's grave and ask forgiveness.

55
00:04:52.783 --> 00:04:57.078
Yes, I understand. 
But why not join me there afterwards?

56
00:04:57.412 --> 00:04:59.747
I can stay in Beijing.

57
00:05:00.874 --> 00:05:02.166
It's possible.

58
00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.300
Do not block the street.

59
00:05:11.385 --> 00:05:12.426
Don't worry. Many thanks.

60
00:05:12.511 --> 00:05:14.470
*Jin-jang, straight to the warehouse.

61
00:05:14.554 --> 00:05:15.554
Let's go.

62
00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:18.891
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

63
00:05:25.607 --> 00:05:28.234
Not one bundle lost. 
I cannot thank you enough.

64
00:05:28.318 --> 00:05:31.612
No, it is my job and I must
say it is simple when no one attacks you.

65
00:05:31.905 --> 00:05:35.616
I am sure the robbers never bother you because
they know there is no way for them to win.

66
00:05:36.326 --> 00:05:40.579
Your father may have started it, but you have
certainly made your security escort the best there is.

67
00:05:40.831 --> 00:05:42.081
Now you are being too kind.

68
00:05:42.165 --> 00:05:43.749
It is the simple truth
and I'm grateful for it.

69
00:05:44.793 --> 00:05:47.003
(DRUMS BEATING)

70
00:06:19.536 --> 00:06:22.246
Lǐ Mùbái and the Green Destiny.

71
00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:26.917
A powerful pair. 
And a legend in China.

72
00:06:27.252 --> 00:06:31.630
No one is worthy of it but he. 
And now he wants to leave it to an old man?

73
00:06:32.132 --> 00:06:35.051
Well, I say no. Too precious.

74
00:06:35.469 --> 00:06:39.138
The Green Destiny is as much a
source of woe as it is of glory.

75
00:06:39.473 --> 00:06:42.099
Taking it would be helping him
shed his old way of life.

76
00:06:42.225 --> 00:06:45.352
I'm sure you can
see the wisdom in that.

77
00:06:45.896 --> 00:06:47.313
Hmm. All right.

78
00:06:47.481 --> 00:06:48.939
But only until he wants it back.

79
00:06:52.027 --> 00:06:54.028
Excuse me. Governor Yù is here, sir.

80
00:06:54.112 --> 00:06:55.696
Coming.
- Thank you.


81
00:06:56.323 --> 00:07:01.285
Really, Bèi-lèyé. 
You have done so much for us. 
We are forever in your debt and if Lǐ and I can do...

82
00:07:01.369 --> 00:07:03.954
Yes, come more often. 
And to start with,

83
00:07:04.372 --> 00:07:06.916
you're going to spend the night.

84
00:07:07.834 --> 00:07:10.211
Now, Xiùlián,

85
00:07:10.295 --> 00:07:14.215
tell me something, and forgive me for prying.

86
00:07:14.966 --> 00:07:17.760
But your late father was a
great and loyal friend to me

87
00:07:17.844 --> 00:07:21.013
and as a result, 
I've come to think of you as my own daughter.

88
00:07:21.264 --> 00:07:23.474
Bèi-lèyé, is something right or is something wrong?

89
00:07:23.809 --> 00:07:28.771
Lǐ Mùbái renouncing his sword and his position. 
His warrior's life.

90
00:07:29.564 --> 00:07:32.358
I would think he's
trying to tell you something.

91
00:07:33.235 --> 00:07:34.485
I would not know.

92
00:07:34.611 --> 00:07:35.861
Don't play the innocent with me.

93
00:07:36.196 --> 00:07:39.073
I've known about the two of
you from the start, all these years.

94
00:07:39.157 --> 00:07:41.575
It's a shame neither
of you has enough courage

95
00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:45.329
to admit the truth to one another.

96
00:07:46.957 --> 00:07:49.667
You're wasting precious time. 
Don't wait too long.

97
00:07:50.752 --> 00:07:52.878
It is not that Mu
Bai and I are cowards.

98
00:07:52.963 --> 00:07:55.422
It is just that, some
topics are not easy to address.

99
00:07:55.507 --> 00:07:57.341
(CHUCKLING)

100
00:07:57.425 --> 00:08:03.222
In affairs of the heart, even the
greatest hero can be a consummate idiot.

101
00:08:04.432 --> 00:08:08.602
The next time you are together, you tell
Mu Bai that time has come for straight-talking.

102
00:08:09.729 --> 00:08:12.565
If he won't, I'm
the one he'll answer to.

103
00:08:21.408 --> 00:08:23.367
The master said to put
the sword in the study.

104
00:08:29.332 --> 00:08:30.374
Yes?

105
00:08:35.714 --> 00:08:39.133
I'm one of your guests. 
I'm Governor Yù's daughter.

106
00:08:41.052 --> 00:08:43.971
Ah. This is the master's study. 
What is it that...

107
00:08:44.347 --> 00:08:48.267
Just looking for a room to sit
in silently and not be a nuisance.

108
00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:51.061
Ah. I am head servant, De Lu.

109
00:08:51.188 --> 00:08:53.230
And this is another of our guests.

110
00:09:05.911 --> 00:09:08.871
I must say, it's heavy for
such a thin piece of metal.

111
00:09:09.122 --> 00:09:13.042
It is all in the hilt. 
And the blade is no ordinary metal.

112
00:09:13.126 --> 00:09:16.295
Still, the sword as
weapons go, is wonderfully light.

113
00:09:16.379 --> 00:09:19.215
The problem is always
getting used to handling them.

114
00:09:19.299 --> 00:09:21.717
It's not a problem for me at all.

115
00:09:21.801 --> 00:09:24.053
When I was little, the western
residence had a garrison of Imperials.

116
00:09:24.137 --> 00:09:26.388
They would let me play guard every day.

117
00:09:27.599 --> 00:09:29.934
This scabbard is so beautiful.

118
00:09:31.436 --> 00:09:33.312
And so is the sword.

119
00:09:33.396 --> 00:09:37.149
Except when it is tainted with blood.

120
00:09:38.109 --> 00:09:40.611
Imagine, this work is 400 years old.

121
00:09:41.238 --> 00:09:42.905
Exquisite.

122
00:09:43.865 --> 00:09:46.367
Sorry, you said it belongs to...

123
00:09:46.618 --> 00:09:48.953
A friend of mine, the warrior, Lǐ Mùbái.

124
00:09:49.496 --> 00:09:51.413
He has decided to give it to Bèi-lèyé.

125
00:09:51.498 --> 00:09:56.085
Lǐ Mùbái! The greatest of all the warriors? 
To Bèi-lèyé?

126
00:09:56.211 --> 00:09:58.212
I wouldn't give up something
like that in a million years.

127
00:09:59.256 --> 00:10:01.048
It is a long story. About swords.

128
00:10:02.884 --> 00:10:04.635
You sound like a real expert.

129
00:10:04.719 --> 00:10:07.179
Oh yes, but I prefer the
guan dao to a normal blade.

130
00:10:07.264 --> 00:10:11.308
I'm not much good with a straight sword. 
For certain moves, however, you really need this.

131
00:10:13.186 --> 00:10:14.561
Blood.

132
00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:19.733
I guess it's wonderful being a warrior. 
To be totally free.

133
00:10:20.151 --> 00:10:23.737
Even our Jiang Hu world has a certain code. 
Integrity, trust,

134
00:10:24.197 --> 00:10:25.948
Friendship.

135
00:10:26.074 --> 00:10:28.826
Without rules, none of
us would survive very long.

136
00:10:29.828 --> 00:10:31.954
I've read all about
the great fighters like you.

137
00:10:32.038 --> 00:10:34.957
Roaming wild, dispensing with those
who get in your way!

138
00:10:35.041 --> 00:10:38.002
If they told how it really
is, they wouldn't sell many books.

139
00:10:38.169 --> 00:10:40.921
You're just like in the stories.

140
00:10:41.047 --> 00:10:44.883
Ha. No place to bathe for days. 
Sleeping on the ground or in flea infested beds.

141
00:10:45.552 --> 00:10:47.761
Is all that in the tales?

142
00:10:47.846 --> 00:10:49.763
In two weeks, I'm marrying.

143
00:10:50.181 --> 00:10:54.184
Only, it's really not the
type of life that I want.

144
00:10:55.478 --> 00:10:58.564
But it is a
good arrangement. So I hear.

145
00:11:02.235 --> 00:11:05.988
Congratulations. 
To get married is a joyous event.

146
00:11:07.574 --> 00:11:09.241
You're not married, by chance?

147
00:11:09.367 --> 00:11:10.993
Think I am?

148
00:11:11.411 --> 00:11:14.705
No. You couldn't roam around so freely.

149
00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:17.666
You are an opponent
I better not argue with.

150
00:11:50.033 --> 00:11:51.867
Bèi-lèyé: Go ahead, governor.

151
00:12:03.338 --> 00:12:08.008
33 inches long, 1-1/10 inches wide.

152
00:12:08.176 --> 00:12:11.470
The hilt is 8
inches long, 2.6 inches wide,

153
00:12:11.805 --> 00:12:15.557
And 7/10 of an inch thick,

154
00:12:15.642 --> 00:12:18.185
With seven rubies missing from the guard.

155

The design tells you that it was made before
the Qing dynasty and engraved with a technique that...

(SWORD CLANGING)

157
00:12:23.483 --> 00:12:26.110
by the time the Han
started to rule, was long-lost.

158
00:12:26.194 --> 00:12:29.321
Bèi-lèyé, they should appoint you court historian.

159
00:12:31.032 --> 00:12:33.242
A sword by itself doesn't rule.

160
00:12:33.451 --> 00:12:36.453
A sword lives through skillful handling.

161
00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:40.040
Please continue, you have an avid listener.

162
00:12:40.208 --> 00:12:43.001
The Imperial court isn't our concern.

163
00:12:43.586 --> 00:12:47.214
With officials and royalty on every street corner,

164
00:12:47.799 --> 00:12:52.010
you can be sure the
Royal Guard keeps security tight.

165
00:12:52.429 --> 00:12:54.763
But Beijing is not a
wilderness like the Western provinces.

166
00:12:54.848 --> 00:12:58.100
This is a world full of wild characters.

167
00:12:59.144 --> 00:13:02.187
Your quest to run a healthy city

168
00:13:02.272 --> 00:13:04.648
depends not on the judges and their courts,

169
00:13:04.732 --> 00:13:07.693
it's by courting the warrior, the Jiang Hu,

170
00:13:08.486 --> 00:13:10.571
that your position will always be safe.

171
00:13:15.201 --> 00:13:18.662
To be strong and supple is the secret. 
To ride out the storm.

(KNOCK AT DOOR)

173
00:13:47.984 --> 00:13:49.359
Governess.

00:13:50.904 --> 00:13:52.154
You can leave.

175
00:13:55.909 --> 00:13:57.534
There you are.

176
00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:00.746
Would you like to try these silk pyjamas? 
I've just made them.

177
00:14:00.914 --> 00:14:02.289
Put them down.

178
00:14:08.087 --> 00:14:10.714
I hear you met Yù Xiùlián today.

179
00:14:11.591 --> 00:14:13.133
You know her?

180
00:14:14.344 --> 00:14:18.180
She's one of those women, your
mother wouldn't like you seeing one bit.

181
00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:23.560
I will socialise with those I want.

182
00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:26.563
Your father's career could suffer for it.
- Please, I'm tired.


183
00:14:29.734 --> 00:14:31.193
All right?

184
00:14:31.319 --> 00:14:32.819
So, go to bed.

185
00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:39.910
Milady is grown now. 
Getting married soon.

186
00:14:41.579 --> 00:14:44.206
Who knows what the future will bring us.

187
00:14:45.166 --> 00:14:47.000
The same old things.

188
00:14:47.835 --> 00:14:49.586
Look, I'm tired. Are you done?

189
00:14:54.342 --> 00:14:57.594
It's autumn. I'll bolt the
windows as I go out.

- It certainly is, sir.

Someone help! There is a thief here! Help me! 
He is on the roof!

Help me!

He is up on the

You let him get away. You coward.

Return the sword, and
I will let you go.

You have been trained at Wudang?

204
00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:36.712
Well, you've got the wrong impression. 
We're street performers from out of town.

205
00:17:36.838 --> 00:17:38.213
We're just rehearsing.

- Father.

Just rehearsing! 
Go and tell another one.

208

BO: I did not get it
back but I know where he went.

216
00:21:19.518 --> 00:21:23.271
I saw him as he was
scaling the wall of the governor's house.

217
00:21:23.356 --> 00:21:25.065
Careful.
- I saw him, really, sir!


218
00:21:25.149 --> 00:21:26.942
That's enough!

219
00:21:38.621 --> 00:21:40.872
Did you show the governor the weapon?

220
00:21:41.290 --> 00:21:44.960
Yes, of course. Only, 
I will not believe he's involved.

221
00:21:45.544 --> 00:21:48.546
That is not to say the
sword is not in his household.

222
00:21:52.218 --> 00:21:56.346
A good way to discredit
a politician and bring him down.

In that case, it's
Lǐ Mùbái's help we need.

I'll write your name. I like that.

00:25:22.931 --> 00:25:26.975
I never noticed how much my
name looks like the word for sword.

You are definitely... talented.

253
00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:32.854
Calligraphy demands the same control as fencing. 
It all lies in the wrist.

I wouldn't know. 
Maybe it does.

I'm told you are nearing your wedding day.

I imagine you are spending
a lot of time getting ready.

259
00:25:49.205 --> 00:25:50.914
I'm hardly lifting a finger at all.

260
00:25:50.998 --> 00:25:53.041
I'm not even thinking about it.

261
00:25:53.125 --> 00:25:57.921
My parents are arranging everything. 
We became acquainted with Lǔ Jūn Pèi when we first got here.

262
00:25:58.297 --> 00:26:02.300
My mother says the Lǔ clan
is very powerful and highly ranked.

263
00:26:02.718 --> 00:26:06.471
And that my marrying one of them
will help father's career a great deal.

264
00:26:06.889 --> 00:26:10.225
Entering such a noble house, 
I should think, is a great honour.

265
00:26:11.101 --> 00:26:15.271
Yes, but I wish that I were like
the exciting heroes in the stories I read.

266
00:26:15.648 --> 00:26:17.941
Characters like Lǐ Mùbái and yourself.

267
00:26:18.817 --> 00:26:20.485
I suppose I'm happy to be marrying.

268
00:26:20.653 --> 00:26:23.071
But when the choice is yours,

269
00:26:23.155 --> 00:26:26.824
to choose a certain life, and when
you're free to choose whom to love

270
00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:30.078
and how to love him, that's real happiness.

271
00:26:31.622 --> 00:26:33.915
Think so? I shall tell you a story.

272
00:26:33.999 --> 00:26:35.667
Is Lǐ Mùbái in it?

273
00:26:35.751 --> 00:26:39.587
And me, yes. I was
also once engaged to be married.

274
00:26:41.006 --> 00:26:42.173
You were?

275
00:26:42.258 --> 00:26:43.800
His name was Meng Si Zhao.

276
00:26:44.301 --> 00:26:47.011
He and Lǐ Mùbái were bound-by-oath.

277
00:26:47.471 --> 00:26:49.681
And one winter day,
they ran into a trap.

278
00:26:49.765 --> 00:26:53.017
Meng rescued Lǐ Mùbái and
in doing so, he was killed.

279
00:26:53.936 --> 00:26:57.522
And so, I became
very close to Mu Bai,

280
00:26:57.606 --> 00:26:59.649
and as we shared
adventures, our feelings grew stronger.

281
00:26:59.733 --> 00:27:03.903
But after Meng's sacrifice, how
could we dishonour his memory?

282
00:27:04.113 --> 00:27:06.948
So you see, I would
like your freedom as well.

283
00:27:07.283 --> 00:27:09.200
And yet, I have never been allowed it.

284
00:27:09.535 --> 00:27:12.036
But don't blame yourselves for it.

285
00:27:12.204 --> 00:27:15.540
The way that Meng died is horrible. 
That's how things happen.

286
00:27:17.543 --> 00:27:20.545
I am a woman, who as
all women, is bound by tradition.

287
00:27:20.963 --> 00:27:25.508
I do not know how it is with
the aristocracy, but it weighs a lot on me.

288
00:27:26.135 --> 00:27:32.015
Please, let's just be women. 
I would like us as sisters. 
I really want us to be friends and be equal.

289
00:27:33.684 --> 00:27:39.354
All right. Then as one sister to another, let me say, 
I sincerely wish you the happiest of marriages.

MADAME YÙ: Will I
ever see a tree again?

Why could your father not
get an appointment closer to civilisation?

292

Miles of nothing!

293
00:28:25.069 --> 00:28:28.613
Jiāolóng! Jiāolóng, are you listening to me?

294
00:28:57.476 --> 00:28:58.810
Time to go!

295
00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:22.792
(GROANING)

296
00:29:22.876 --> 00:29:23.918
Help me, please!

297
00:29:24.002 --> 00:29:24.961
Father!

298
00:29:25.045 --> 00:29:27.547
I'm a friend, I am! 
Please, please, don't murder me!

299
00:29:31.343 --> 00:29:34.220
I couldn't care less about your sword.

300
00:29:34.304 --> 00:29:36.431
How is it you
were there at the palace?

301
00:29:36.557 --> 00:29:38.683
I'm after someone. 
Bìyǎn Húli.

302
00:29:39.518 --> 00:29:43.771
I'm really a police officer
of the Gen Su district.

303
00:29:43.856 --> 00:29:47.731
There is a rumor that this
master criminal is in the Yù household.

304
00:29:47.858 --> 00:29:48.817
She must have come with them from Xingyang.

305
00:29:49.026 --> 00:29:51.571
But since he's governor,

306
00:29:52.030 --> 00:29:53.040
I can't just barge in.

307
00:29:53.741 --> 00:29:56.701
I have to... find a
way to lure the Fox out.

308
00:29:56.785 --> 00:29:57.785
This Bìyǎn Húli, you say is a woman?

309
00:29:57.870 --> 00:29:58.995
Right.

310
00:29:59.079 --> 00:30:01.289
What is a fuss about - ah
thank you - let me handle her.

311
00:30:01.415 --> 00:30:04.041
With all due respect 
- I do not think you're up to it.

312
00:30:04.585 --> 00:30:07.836
My late wife used to
be quite skilled at martial arts.

313
00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:11.629
And Jade Fox, as Bìyǎn Húli
calls herself, killed her in four moves.

314
00:30:11.714 --> 00:30:13.384
For which she'll answer also.

315
00:30:14.887 --> 00:30:16.429
Chowder's ready!

316
00:30:16.555 --> 00:30:17.991
Mmm chowder, oh I adore chowder.

317
00:30:18.181 --> 00:30:21.142
I am glad but 
- Father gets the first taste.

318
00:30:23.896 --> 00:30:25.062
Hey!

319
00:30:26.064 --> 00:30:27.607
Gone.

320
00:30:29.276 --> 00:30:30.651
What does it say?

321
00:30:30.736 --> 00:30:33.946
Come to Yellow Hill about midnight and we shall settle this.
- Fox


322
00:30:34.072 --> 00:30:36.574
We've lured her out.

323
00:30:38.494 --> 00:30:39.619
This way.

324
00:30:41.538 --> 00:30:43.789
Xiùlián, you see who's here.

325
00:30:49.671 --> 00:30:53.257
Bèi-lèyé believes it is a plot to embarrass governor Yù. 
That it is political.

326
00:30:53.342 --> 00:30:56.969
But there is something amiss in the Yù household.  
I'm looking into it.

327
00:30:57.054 --> 00:30:58.596
What is it about?

328
00:31:11.193 --> 00:31:13.611
Jade Fox?  I don't believe it! 
That woman here?

329
00:31:13.946 --> 00:31:16.906
I know. We all
thought she'd flung to Xingyang.

330
00:31:16.990 --> 00:31:19.283
I never thought she
would dare come back here.

331
00:31:19.368 --> 00:31:23.037
And what safer place to
hide then with the governor?

332
00:31:25.123 --> 00:31:28.376
So finally I can... avenge the master.

333
00:31:29.795 --> 00:31:32.171
Be careful, Mu Bai. 
This city is...

334
00:31:32.756 --> 00:31:34.924
Is a beehive of power struggles.

335
00:31:35.092 --> 00:31:37.677
For Bèi-lèyé, the most important thing is
not to get caught in the middle.

336
00:31:37.761 --> 00:31:41.347
Your personal matters could complicate
things and, I mean —

337
00:31:41.974 --> 00:31:44.850
Who knows if this
hanging these posters isn't —

338
00:31:44.935 --> 00:31:46.936
To provoke complications.

339
00:31:49.648 --> 00:31:51.107
Any idea who hung them up?

340
00:31:51.191 --> 00:31:52.316
It was done at night.

341
00:31:52.401 --> 00:31:54.527
Well, they claim Jade
Fox is at the governor's.

342
00:31:54.945 --> 00:31:58.823
Now according to Bèi-lèyé, the very night the
sword was stolen, there was a fight near there.

343
00:31:58.907 --> 00:32:00.908
Were you involved?

344
00:32:00.993 --> 00:32:04.161
There was Bèi-lèyé's house guard who I believe

345
00:32:04.246 --> 00:32:05.997
followed the thief to the Yùs.

346
00:32:06.081 --> 00:32:07.832
Have you questioned him yet?

347
00:32:07.916 --> 00:32:10.084
Not privately - it is a matter of...

348
00:32:10.168 --> 00:32:13.087
But you have your men keeping
an eye on the governor's house?

349
00:32:13.839 --> 00:32:16.257
No, I'd already sent them off.

350
00:32:18.176 --> 00:32:20.428
I may have lost the
Green Destiny, only trust me -

351
00:32:20.512 --> 00:32:24.015
I will get the sword back,
and soon, by using my own methods.

352
00:32:25.851 --> 00:32:29.937
Look, I do not really care. 
I am not concerned about property.

353
00:32:30.147 --> 00:32:33.608
Well, it is a part of you, isn't it?  
I mean, otherwise, why come?

354
00:32:34.276 --> 00:32:37.403
What I meant was, 
I did not know it was stolen until I got here.

355
00:32:38.905 --> 00:32:40.656
Then, why did you...

356
00:32:42.868 --> 00:32:45.369
Well, I thought we had made
- we had talked about it.

357
00:32:48.915 --> 00:32:52.376
Pardon my intrusion. 
Master Lǐ, your room is ready.

358
00:32:54.796 --> 00:32:56.213
Thank you.

359
00:32:57.007 --> 00:32:58.883
Could you show me the way?

360
00:33:09.770 --> 00:33:12.271
BO: Not only is this
Jade Fox a murderer, she's a...

361
00:33:12.356 --> 00:33:14.357
A rather unpunctual one.

362
00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:24.241
BO: Halt! Show your face!

363
00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:30.873
You scum!  I told you that night.

364
00:33:31.458 --> 00:33:33.876
To leave me alone or
you'll pay with your life!

365
00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:36.545
Pay with our life?  
I doubt that very much.

366
00:33:36.755 --> 00:33:39.924
If you surrender to us now,
you'll suffer less in the end.

367
00:33:40.217 --> 00:33:43.094
If not, consider this your execution!

368
00:33:43.261 --> 00:33:46.180
Father!  I shall avenge mother!

369
00:33:46.264 --> 00:33:48.516
I will help you
join her, you little slut.

370
00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:51.268
That is what you think!  
You are going straight to hell!

371
00:33:51.561 --> 00:33:55.189
(SCREAMING)

372
00:33:57.734 --> 00:33:58.734
(GRUNTING)

373
00:34:00.654 --> 00:34:01.654
(GROANS)

374
00:34:26.471 --> 00:34:27.638
MAY: Father, stay back!

375
00:34:32.978 --> 00:34:33.978
(SCREAMING)

376
00:34:57.002 --> 00:35:00.504
TSAI: Get out of the way!

377
00:35:14.853 --> 00:35:17.229
Watch out! It hurts!

378
00:35:23.195 --> 00:35:24.820
TSAI: May!

379
00:35:33.288 --> 00:35:35.289
And so you die!

380
00:35:37.709 --> 00:35:39.710
Ambush won't work.

381
00:35:43.924 --> 00:35:46.091
MAY: Father, are you all right?
TSAI: I'm fine.


382
00:35:46.718 --> 00:35:49.553
The Wudang masters never killing
you was a great mistake.

383
00:35:50.055 --> 00:35:52.181
You've had ten years to rally, Jade Fox!

384
00:35:53.266 --> 00:35:58.562
Oh, you do not remember me, but you knew my
master, the greatest of all our teachers, *Li Dang Pen.

385
00:35:59.439 --> 00:36:01.692
The year I was away, some woman arrived.

386
00:36:01.777 --> 00:36:09.573
Disguised as a nun, poisoned *Li Dang and stole our secret training manual. Yes, 
I think it is time you answered for what you did to us all!

387
00:36:09.950 --> 00:36:12.535
Your master had no respect for women.

388
00:36:12.619 --> 00:36:15.663
I was good enough to
sleep with, but not to teach!

389
00:36:15.747 --> 00:36:19.333
What better punishment, than to
die by a woman's hands!

390
00:36:29.594 --> 00:36:30.928
(SCREAMING)

391
00:36:59.624 --> 00:37:02.585
You stole the secrets
of Wudang's highest martial arts.

392
00:37:02.669 --> 00:37:05.754
But after ten years of
training, your moves are still undisciplined.

393
00:37:05.839 --> 00:37:08.465
To die under a
Wudang's sword tonight is fitting...

394
00:37:10.343 --> 00:37:11.343
and no disgrace!

395
00:37:17.642 --> 00:37:20.811
*Wudang Dark, my disciple, is here! Together, we can kill them all!
- No, let's go!


396
00:37:21.146 --> 00:37:23.063
How many Jade Fox's are there?

397
00:37:23.148 --> 00:37:25.190
Wait, just let me
get rid of that meddler!

398
00:37:31.489 --> 00:37:32.990
Who are you?

399
00:37:34.951 --> 00:37:38.287
And what are you doing
with the Green Destiny sword?

400
00:37:38.872 --> 00:37:40.080
That's my affair.

401
00:37:40.165 --> 00:37:44.501
My name is Lǐ Mùbái. 
The Green Destiny is mine.

402
00:37:54.888 --> 00:37:57.222
Bìyǎn Húli is not
good enough to teach that.

403
00:37:57.349 --> 00:37:59.350
That is a "Xuan Piu" move
- how do you know it?

404
00:37:59.434 --> 00:38:01.352
Just improvising.

405
00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:08.609
Ll MU BAI:
Who is your real master?


406
00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:23.749
(GROANS)

407
00:38:23.833 --> 00:38:24.833
MAY: Father!

408
00:38:30.382 --> 00:38:31.423
I'll kill all of you.
- That's enough.


409
00:38:31.508 --> 00:38:32.758
Come on, let's go.

410
00:38:34.094 --> 00:38:36.053
Nevermind him, let's go!

411
00:38:37.722 --> 00:38:39.390
It's not over yet, Lǐ Mùbái!

412
00:38:41.643 --> 00:38:42.726
MAY: Father!

413
00:38:43.937 --> 00:38:52.778
Father!

414
00:38:55.782 --> 00:38:56.782
Father.

415
00:39:04.958 --> 00:39:06.500
Who was Tsai Xiang?

416
00:39:08.461 --> 00:39:12.047
He was my father, a policeman from *Jetsu.

417
00:39:13.758 --> 00:39:17.761
And there are certain obligations
with the demise of an official.

418
00:39:18.596 --> 00:39:20.597
Such as reporting it.

419
00:39:20.682 --> 00:39:24.226
Yet you think the killer has
taken refuge in the governor's residence.

420
00:39:25.645 --> 00:39:27.938
I'd sake my life on it.

421
00:39:32.152 --> 00:39:33.694
Come with me.

422
00:39:35.488 --> 00:39:38.282
This must be resolved. 
Beijing doesn't need a scandal.

423
00:39:39.159 --> 00:39:42.119
The simple solution is the direct one
- enter the house and find her.

424
00:39:42.495 --> 00:39:45.414
I'll ferret out the Fox and whatever
gang she has got in no time.

425
00:39:45.498 --> 00:39:50.127
You cannot just break in. 
The governor is responsible for law and order in this city.

426
00:39:50.545 --> 00:39:53.047
And any trouble at his residence, could embarrass

427
00:39:53.131 --> 00:39:55.466
primarily the governor but also Bèi-lèyé.

428
00:39:57.469 --> 00:39:59.428
It's a delicate problem.

429
00:39:59.512 --> 00:40:05.100
Bèi-lèyé, is it possible to find some excuse to
invite the governor's wife and their daughter over here?

430
00:40:06.686 --> 00:40:08.479
What do you have in mind?

431
00:40:09.814 --> 00:40:13.067
The best way to trap
a fox is through her cub.

432
00:40:16.196 --> 00:40:21.575
Oh, my goodness! 
Bèi-lèyé's wife is spoiling us with all these wedding gifts.

433
00:40:21.910 --> 00:40:24.912
She is being so considerate.

434
00:40:25.038 --> 00:40:28.332
She is sorry she is not feeling
well and cannot act as a proper hostess.

435
00:40:28.416 --> 00:40:31.126
I heard that something
was lost in the house.

436
00:40:31.336 --> 00:40:34.213
And now Bèi-lèyé's wife is feeling ill.

437
00:40:34.714 --> 00:40:37.341
We know who it is
that has taken the article.

438
00:40:40.345 --> 00:40:43.514
And if the thief would
be good enough to return it,

439
00:40:43.848 --> 00:40:47.184
I am sure that Bèi-lèyé
will pursue the matter no further.

440
00:40:47.393 --> 00:40:48.894
That is good.

441
00:40:49.187 --> 00:40:53.357
Though it is annoying when household
servants cannot keep their hands to themselves.

442
00:40:54.025 --> 00:40:57.778
Bèi-lèyé knows that even
well-meaning people can make mistakes

443
00:40:57.862 --> 00:41:02.574
from which personal ruin and disgrace
can extend to their entire families.

444
00:41:03.785 --> 00:41:05.702
Well, do not be
too lenient with the culprit.

445
00:41:05.912 --> 00:41:11.291
Yes. And I am sure we will see no mercy
granted, the murderer who has just shown up here in Beijing.

446
00:41:11.543 --> 00:41:13.043
MADAME YU: Murderer?

447
00:41:13.169 --> 00:41:18.549
Yes, and as it turns out, this
same woman killed Lǐ Mùbái's first instructor.

448
00:41:18.925 --> 00:41:22.845
She murdered a policeman, the other
night, who had tracked her down.

449
00:41:22.929 --> 00:41:25.556
MADAME YU: A female criminal! That is news!

450
00:41:25.890 --> 00:41:28.892
Policeman? You say she killed an officer?

451
00:41:29.394 --> 00:41:31.811
An inspector from *Jensu who
had been hunting her for years.

452
00:41:31.895 --> 00:41:34.565
He even came here in disguise.

453
00:41:34.649 --> 00:41:38.986
Well, I wonder if the thief
and the murderer are the same.

454
00:41:39.279 --> 00:41:40.821
That, I rather doubt.

455
00:41:41.406 --> 00:41:45.409
This particular thief is very unusual.

456
00:41:45.618 --> 00:41:48.579
And much smarter than a mere killer.

457
00:42:00.592 --> 00:42:02.301
Shalom and *greetings, sir.

458
00:42:02.385 --> 00:42:04.511
Good good. Madame Yù, 
I would like to

459
00:42:05.263 --> 00:42:08.640
introduce Lǐ Mùbái, the renowned swordsman.

460
00:42:09.184 --> 00:42:11.977
Madame Yù, it's a great honour,
very great, to meet you both.

461

"li mu bai" means skill.

482
00:44:17.478 --> 00:44:20.480
Wudang signifies skill.

483
00:44:20.565 --> 00:44:23.567
Even this sword here stands for skill but
it is all really a state of mind.

Don't talk like a monk just
because you're in a temple. Just fight!

486
00:44:30.074 --> 00:44:31.241
Leave her out of this!

There is a quick lesson
for you, just for a start.

494

Go ahead.

495
00:45:28.674 --> 00:45:30.884
Why should I? It is practise, you need.

496
00:45:30.968 --> 00:45:33.637
There are endless things you could
learn to do with the Green Destiny.

497
00:45:33.971 --> 00:45:36.765
But to start with, you must
learn to hold it in stillness.

498
00:45:39.310 --> 00:45:41.311
Why do you want to teach me?

499
00:45:42.855 --> 00:45:48.734
Wudang is not an art for everyone. 
I have always imagined myself as the teacher of a student truly worthy of it.

500
00:45:49.862 --> 00:45:52.739
Aren't you afraid I'd kill
you once I mastered it?

501
00:45:52.824 --> 00:45:56.076
Deep down, you are good,
so I will take my chances.

502
00:45:56.160 --> 00:46:01.080
When I see that Bìyǎn Húli corruption has not tainted you, 
I feel secure.

503
00:46:01.958 --> 00:46:05.502
Wudang is a whorehouse! 
You can keep your lessons to yourself!

504
00:46:24.564 --> 00:46:27.482
You are home rather late,
or should I say early?

505
00:46:30.361 --> 00:46:35.030
Why are you still here? 
You know what you did? 
You killed a police officer!

506
00:46:35.199 --> 00:46:37.909
My whole family could
be ruined, thanks to you!

507
00:46:38.202 --> 00:46:42.080
If it hadn't been for your sword robbery,
that police officer would never have tracked me down.

508
00:46:42.498 --> 00:46:43.249
Wake up!

509
00:46:43.333 --> 00:46:46.042
Don't forget you're a grown woman now.

510
00:46:46.377 --> 00:46:50.247
Did you think stealing was fun? 
That death is on your head as well as mine!

511
00:46:50.673 --> 00:46:53.091
Come with me as my disciple

512
00:46:53.551 --> 00:46:57.304
don't waste your life
married to some sycophantic bureaucrat.

513
00:46:57.847 --> 00:46:59.848
Together, we'll steal the world.

514
00:46:59.932 --> 00:47:01.641
I'll never go against the law!

515
00:47:01.726 --> 00:47:03.685
Steal a sword is against the law!

516
00:47:03.769 --> 00:47:05.145
But where could I go?

517
00:47:05.229 --> 00:47:07.105
Why do I have to leave, any way?
- To be free!


518
00:47:08.232 --> 00:47:09.941
To do whatever we like.

519
00:47:10.067 --> 00:47:11.818
And to kill anyone
who gets in our way.

520
00:47:11.903 --> 00:47:12.861
Even your father, should he -

521
00:47:12.945 --> 00:47:14.029
Stop it, will you!

522
00:47:14.113 --> 00:47:16.822
In Jiang Hu, that's how we live.

523
00:47:16.907 --> 00:47:17.616
Kill or be killed.

524
00:47:18.242 --> 00:47:21.911
Exciting, isn't it? 
Kill or be killed.

525
00:47:25.041 --> 00:47:27.250
Why should I do it? 
I owe you nothing!

526
00:47:27.376 --> 00:47:29.586
My dear, you owe a lot!

527
00:47:31.339 --> 00:47:35.091
You are still my disciple. 
My life has been happily dedicated to that.

528
00:47:42.141 --> 00:47:46.436
You believe I learned the skills I
have from your deciphering out the manual?

529
00:47:46.938 --> 00:47:49.231
You couldn't read the symbols.

530
00:47:51.234 --> 00:47:53.860
It was just the drawings I studied

531
00:47:53.945 --> 00:47:56.029
while trusting you with the code.

532
00:47:56.113 --> 00:48:00.200
You wouldn't have understood if
I'd explained it any way.

533
00:48:00.326 --> 00:48:04.037
It's hard to admit but, you know
you've gone as far as you can go.

534
00:48:05.039 --> 00:48:07.832
And because I was afraid you'd be hurt, 
I hid my skills.

535
00:48:10.336 --> 00:48:13.338
How Lǐ Mùbái reacted to
your skill the other night,

536
00:48:14.382 --> 00:48:17.801
I became aware of how
much you kept from me.

537
00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:21.888
Understand, I...

538
00:48:23.599 --> 00:48:26.935
I started learning from you
in secret when I was 10.

539
00:48:27.353 --> 00:48:30.564
You enchanted me with the
world of Jiang Hu, but...

540
00:48:30.648 --> 00:48:34.542
when I realised I could
exceed you, you can't imagine...

541
00:48:34.694 --> 00:48:37.279
how miserably alone I was!

542
00:48:37.863 --> 00:48:41.575
With nobody to guide me,
no master I could turn to.

543
00:48:43.411 --> 00:48:45.287
Who could say, "Do this."

544
00:48:47.373 --> 00:48:51.251
Now, there's one thing for certain
- my lessons aren't over yet.

(SWORD CLANGING)

546
00:50:03.949 --> 00:50:07.035
Are you happy to see the sword again?

547
00:50:08.496 --> 00:50:12.082
Getting it back made me realise
how much I had missed it.

548
00:50:13.959 --> 00:50:18.254
Only, it is no longer yours, is it? 
You gave it to Bèi-lèyé.

549
00:50:20.174 --> 00:50:24.678
True. But l must borrow
it for one final task.

550
00:50:25.554 --> 00:50:27.931
Jade Fox still has
to die by it, yes?

551
00:50:31.519 --> 00:50:36.064
Xiùlián, when you told lies for that
girl, did you know what you were hiding?

552
00:50:36.816 --> 00:50:40.276
My task was to get back the sword
and not cause a scandal in the process.

553
00:50:40.903 --> 00:50:45.657
I wasn't about to ruin a young
girl's life over nothing, or her father's either.

554
00:50:46.117 --> 00:50:48.917
A hard thing to keep
balanced and you did it well.

555
00:50:49.002 --> 00:50:51.204
It is this... your girl.

556
00:50:52.790 --> 00:50:54.666
I saw her last night.

557
00:50:56.627 --> 00:50:58.837
I was sure you'd
be on the look out.

558
00:50:59.130 --> 00:51:00.964
She needs direction and training.

559
00:51:01.173 --> 00:51:03.800
But she is the most
promising student I've ever seen.

560
00:51:04.510 --> 00:51:07.679
She is an aristocrat. 
She has nothing at all to do with us.

561
00:51:07.805 --> 00:51:10.140
Mu Bai, this whole
thing will be over soon.

562
00:51:10.224 --> 00:51:13.351
You kill Jade Fox and
let Jiāolóng marry Lǔ Jūn Pèi.

563
00:51:15.563 --> 00:51:19.524
Her spirit is free. 
I think she wants to start studying at Wudang.

564
00:51:20.985 --> 00:51:23.027
Wudang does not train women.

565
00:51:23.362 --> 00:51:25.989
Yes, well, she could be the exception.

566
00:51:26.073 --> 00:51:29.993
A special case. 
Otherwise, she could become a poison dragon if left on her own.

567
00:51:30.619 --> 00:51:33.163
We must not meddle. 
Say she is taken

568
00:51:33.497 --> 00:51:37.625
and is trained at Wudang, her husband, with
his high rank, could be embarrassed by it.

569
00:51:41.672 --> 00:51:43.840
I gave the sword to Bèi-lèyé,

570
00:51:44.008 --> 00:51:46.176
hoping that I could start a new life,

571
00:51:46.510 --> 00:51:49.804
but the world of Jiang Hu refuses
to let me go, and the bloodshed continues.

572
00:51:51.682 --> 00:51:53.516
We cannot give up yet.

573
00:51:54.059 --> 00:51:57.187

00:57:50.040 --> 00:57:51.124
Xiǎohǔ: Please, let's rest.

616
00:57:51.208 --> 00:57:52.792
Jiāolóng: I want my comb!

617
00:57:53.877 --> 00:57:56.170
You're tired. You need rest.

618
00:58:02.219 --> 00:58:05.513
Your horse needs water. 
There's a spring here.

619
00:58:11.562 --> 00:58:12.979
(LAUGHING)

620
00:58:13.063 --> 00:58:15.731
Well, there was last year.

621
00:58:22.098 --> 00:58:23.865
What's your name? Don't be shy.

622
00:58:25.159 --> 00:58:28.411
I'm known as Dark Cloud. 
The Hans call me that because I rain terror.

623
00:58:29.204 --> 00:58:32.540
Well, I may not be a cloud, but I'm pretty dark. 
And quick as lightning.

624
00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:34.167
Here.

625
00:58:38.634 --> 00:58:41.260
My real name is Xiǎohǔ. What's yours?

626
00:58:45.888 --> 00:58:47.388
Give me my comb.

627
00:59:17.753 --> 00:59:18.794
(GRUNTS)

628
01:00:23.151 --> 01:00:25.903
You found an arrow. 
I can make you a bow to go with it.

629
01:00:26.363 --> 01:00:28.489
For hunting wild chicken.

630
01:00:28.699 --> 01:00:30.366
Very good to eat.

631
01:00:35.872 --> 01:00:38.582
You need to eat. Understand?

632
01:00:39.626 --> 01:00:42.628
For you to regain the
strength to fight Dark Cloud.

633
01:00:55.267 --> 01:00:58.436
Maybe you should eat more slowly
- you have lots of time.

634
01:01:17.664 --> 01:01:19.832
(HUMMING)

635
01:03:00.976 --> 01:03:02.393
(COUGHING)

636
01:03:04.563 --> 01:03:07.857
It's better this way
with the temper you've got.

637
01:03:14.406 --> 01:03:15.865
You filthy coward!

638
01:03:19.202 --> 01:03:22.621
Come on, you're still mad? 
I mean, at least you're talking.

639
01:03:23.540 --> 01:03:25.082
You gonna tell me your name?

640
01:03:25.167 --> 01:03:26.167
(SPITTING)

641
01:03:26.751 --> 01:03:29.753
"Ptt" - that's a
beautiful name for a Han.

642
01:03:40.891 --> 01:03:43.392
(SOBBING)

643
01:04:09.377 --> 01:04:13.631
Relax. If I had in mind what you're thinking, 
I'd have done it already.

644
01:04:14.966 --> 01:04:17.092
You must want a bath.

645
01:04:17.177 --> 01:04:20.471
Fresh water is hard to get here.

646
01:04:21.306 --> 01:04:23.724
But I was able to bring some back.

647
01:04:23.808 --> 01:04:26.352
You can wear my clothes when you're done.

648
01:04:26.770 --> 01:04:28.312
They're clean.

649
01:04:44.454 --> 01:04:45.913
Xiǎohǔ: Don't worry.

650
01:04:48.291 --> 01:04:51.293
I will sing, so you
will always know where I am.

651
01:04:52.879 --> 01:04:55.881
You will feel good
after the bath, but, uh...

652
01:04:57.133 --> 01:05:00.052
no more rocks on the head.

653
01:05:03.098 --> 01:05:13.098
(SINGING)

654
01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.043
All this trouble, just
to get a comb back?

655
01:06:14.836 --> 01:06:16.879
It's worth it.

656
01:06:17.756 --> 01:06:21.884
It's a thing you wouldn't understand. 
What is it to a barbarian?

657
01:06:22.510 --> 01:06:25.971
I can use it to
pick fleas from my horse.

658
01:06:26.931 --> 01:06:30.558
And by the way, I'm not a Han. 
I'm Manchurian.

659
01:06:32.145 --> 01:06:34.396
Oh, I'm sorry, 
I could've sworn.

660
01:06:35.065 --> 01:06:37.149
You were really a Han.

661
01:06:39.277 --> 01:06:40.903
I want my comb back.

662
01:06:45.158 --> 01:06:47.660
No one orders me around.

663
01:06:54.250 --> 01:06:55.793
Give it back.

664
01:07:11.726 --> 01:07:13.602
(GRUNTING)

665
01:08:12.913 --> 01:08:16.832
<i>Xiǎohǔ: One night, when I was little, 
I saw a thousand stars fall out of the sky.</i>

666
01:08:16.916 --> 01:08:19.877
<i>Where'd they all go? 
I wondered.</i>

667
01:08:20.171 --> 01:08:24.131
<i>Then I thought, maybe if I ride to the end of the desert, 
I'd find them.</i>

668
01:08:24.632 --> 01:08:26.133
<i>I'm an orphan.</i>

669
01:08:26.259 --> 01:08:27.760
<i>I was always doing things alone.</i>

670
01:08:29.763 --> 01:08:33.515
So I rode out one morning and I've
been riding all over the desert ever since.

671
01:08:35.643 --> 01:08:38.562
And after riding all over the desert, 
I'm now a bandit.

672
01:08:40.106 --> 01:08:42.691
And since he couldn't find the stars,

673
01:08:42.776 --> 01:08:46.111
he robs young girls of their combs.

674
01:08:47.197 --> 01:08:50.199
Out here, simple survival is the main occupation.

675
01:08:51.242 --> 01:08:54.203
So, first thing, you
join others, form a group.

676
01:08:54.954 --> 01:08:57.873
The group is your shelter, your strength.

677
01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.211
I'm not a real bandit.

678
01:09:01.295 --> 01:09:04.296
It's just easier that
way to fill my stomach.

679
01:09:05.423 --> 01:09:10.093
So in your heart, you're still a
child searching, for where the stars fell.

680
01:09:11.888 --> 01:09:17.601
A grown man, gazing at the sky. 
And thinking the brightest star has fallen at his side.

681
01:09:40.625 --> 01:09:43.335
The army is looking for you.

682
01:10:05.358 --> 01:10:06.817
(MEN CHATTERING)

683
01:10:13.533 --> 01:10:16.410
They're still out there, keep circling closer.

684
01:10:18.121 --> 01:10:19.705
They'll stop some day.

685
01:10:20.999 --> 01:10:23.959
They won't and I'll be running forever.

686
01:10:26.129 --> 01:10:28.714
I'll run with you.

687
01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:32.259
You should think about it.

688
01:10:32.594 --> 01:10:35.596
You could grow tired of
this and weary of us.

689
01:10:37.473 --> 01:10:39.808
Start to miss your father. Your mother.

690
01:10:40.977 --> 01:10:43.979
If our daughter disappeared, we'd be out searching.

691
01:10:44.147 --> 01:10:45.898
We'd miss her and she'd miss us.

692
01:10:52.738 --> 01:10:55.365
Jiāolóng, I want to earn your hand.

693
01:10:57.368 --> 01:11:01.496
What if I leave the desert
and make my mark in this world?

694
01:11:02.790 --> 01:11:06.752
We nomads have a legend. 
See that mountain, there on the right?

695
01:11:07.045 --> 01:11:09.212
Jump off, your wish will be granted.

696
01:11:09.964 --> 01:11:13.508
A long time ago, a man's
children were very ill, so he jumped.

697
01:11:14.928 --> 01:11:17.679
He didn't die, wasn't even hurt.

698
01:11:19.015 --> 01:11:22.184
He just floated away, happily, never to return.

699
01:11:23.770 --> 01:11:25.812
He knew his children were well again.

700
01:11:27.190 --> 01:11:29.524
And the Hans, they also say it.

701
01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:32.444
"What really makes wishes come true -

702
01:11:32.904 --> 01:11:35.781
is the trust in the heart."

703
01:11:46.417 --> 01:11:48.043
Keep it by your heart.

704
01:11:49.295 --> 01:11:52.047
And when we're together
again, you will return it.

705
01:11:54.592 --> 01:11:55.884
l will.

706
01:12:03.434 --> 01:12:07.229
Otherwise, I'll come after you, if
I have to cross the entire desert.

707
01:12:07.981 --> 01:12:10.691
And next time, 
I will show you no mercy.

708
01:12:21.453 --> 01:12:28.291
I tried to make my mark, but wherever I went, someone always recognised me. 
I really tried.

709
01:12:31.587 --> 01:12:33.505
Then I heard you'd moved here.

710
01:12:33.589 --> 01:12:35.424
I was afraid you were gone forever.

711
01:12:36.426 --> 01:12:38.051
So I came.

712
01:12:39.137 --> 01:12:41.847
Don't get married like this.

713
01:12:45.101 --> 01:12:46.184
Go away.

714
01:12:47.186 --> 01:12:48.395
Jiāolóng.

715
01:12:51.190 --> 01:12:52.607
Don't ever come back again.

716
01:12:52.775 --> 01:12:54.192
So that is it?

717
01:12:56.446 --> 01:12:57.612
It is.

There is no doubt she is out there.

723
01:13:39.906 --> 01:13:42.324
But she is not about
to let herself be seen.

724
01:13:42.825 --> 01:13:48.246
We will be on the alert because I know she is
going to come for the girl, sooner or later. She must.

up and go back to the desert with you?

her again, if it can be arranged?

to help Lord Jūn
to find his young wife.

Hello there.
You mind if I ask your name?


761
01:17:10.616 --> 01:17:11.866
It's Long.

762

So, it's young Master Long. Greetings.

I am Eagle Sung Ming,
is what they call me.

And this is Flying Cougar
Li Yùn, my fellow brother.

01:17:23.629 --> 01:17:27.465
And what brings you to Huai An
and where are you headed, young Master Long?

Anywhere there's a need.

767
01:17:31.220 --> 01:17:34.889
In that case, Master Long, perhaps
we could assist you some how.

768
01:17:36.267 --> 01:17:37.809
I rather doubt it.

769
01:17:39.437 --> 01:17:41.896
It appears young Master Long has not understood.

770
01:17:43.899 --> 01:17:45.734

01:36:57.385 --> 01:36:59.303
(SCREAMS)

931
01:37:51.105 --> 01:37:52.606
What is it that you want?

932
01:37:52.732 --> 01:37:55.984
What I have always
wanted - to instruct you.

933
01:38:28.601 --> 01:38:31.979
Only if, in three moves, you get
the Green Destiny out of my hand.

934
01:38:32.981 --> 01:38:35.023
Will I let you.

935
01:38:39.112 --> 01:38:40.988
That wasn't what -
- Bow to your teacher!


936
01:38:41.072 --> 01:38:42.281
Never!

937
01:38:42.365 --> 01:38:43.448
In that case, you don't need this!

938
01:39:29.621 --> 01:39:31.413
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

939
01:39:58.941 --> 01:40:02.569
It would only be a matter of
time before they dragged you back to Beijing.

940
01:40:02.820 --> 01:40:06.615
But your parents will never accept you again.

941
01:40:09.619 --> 01:40:12.870
And since you've gone
this far, why go home?

942
01:40:12.954 --> 01:40:14.206
The world is ours.

943
01:40:14.916 --> 01:40:17.000
And you'll always be my Lady.

944
01:40:20.004 --> 01:40:23.924
And no one will rule over us.

945
01:40:24.133 --> 01:40:26.635
We'll be happy - that
is the most important thing.

946
01:40:27.261 --> 01:40:30.389
Anyway, all we have left is each other.

947
01:40:35.103 --> 01:40:37.020
Ah, lie back, try to sleep.

948
01:40:59.877 --> 01:41:02.754
Crazy girl like that,
you should have killed her.

949
01:41:02.839 --> 01:41:05.006
I did not have the heart to.

950
01:41:05.091 --> 01:41:07.259
Lǐ Mùbái - let
him take care of it.

951
01:42:18.122 --> 01:42:20.499
Is it the girl
or the sword you want?

952
01:42:40.853 --> 01:42:42.729
You have been drugged.

953
01:43:00.623 --> 01:43:02.332
Where is she hiding?

954
01:43:44.834 --> 01:43:46.543
What has happened?

955
01:43:47.628 --> 01:43:49.504
Bìyǎn Húli has drugged her, 
I'm pulling her out.

956
01:43:50.047 --> 01:43:51.923
How did you get here?

957
01:43:54.093 --> 01:43:55.969
We followed her after
spotting her near the warehouse.

958
01:43:58.890 --> 01:44:00.390
Get down!

959
01:44:03.811 --> 01:44:05.145
(SCREAMING)

960
01:44:10.484 --> 01:44:11.693
Master!

961
01:44:12.653 --> 01:44:14.237
(SCREAMING)

962
01:44:26.167 --> 01:44:28.126
And so you die.

963
01:44:30.379 --> 01:44:32.130
And so shall you.

964
01:44:40.473 --> 01:44:42.265
The needle is...

965
01:44:45.978 --> 01:44:47.812
Yes, the needle is poisoned.

966
01:44:49.565 --> 01:44:51.399
You deserve to die.

967
01:44:51.859 --> 01:44:54.277
But it was Jiāolóng I was aiming at.

968
01:44:56.155 --> 01:44:58.156
Ten years I devoted to you

969
01:44:58.532 --> 01:45:00.575
but you deceived me.

970
01:45:01.061 --> 01:45:05.246
You hid the manual's true meaning. 
I never got better

971
01:45:06.666 --> 01:45:10.335
while your skill was... got greater then greater.

972
01:45:12.546 --> 01:45:14.547
You know what poison is?

973
01:45:15.299 --> 01:45:18.134
An eight-year-old girl who is full of deceit.

974
01:45:18.636 --> 01:45:20.345
That is poison.

975
01:45:24.350 --> 01:45:25.475
Jiāolóng.

976
01:45:27.311 --> 01:45:28.812
My only love,

977
01:45:30.231 --> 01:45:31.731
and only rival.

978
01:45:41.242 --> 01:45:44.536
You cannot die. The poison! 
Tell us what you used!

979
01:45:44.745 --> 01:45:46.371
Tell me the poison!

980
01:45:46.872 --> 01:45:49.416
The antidote! What is it? Tell me!

981
01:45:49.709 --> 01:45:52.460
I can't let him die! 
Lǐ Mùbái mustn't die!

982
01:45:52.545 --> 01:45:53.670
JIĀLÓNG: It's Purple Yin Poison.

983
01:45:53.754 --> 01:45:54.879
What?

984
01:45:55.756 --> 01:45:59.092
Purple Yin Poison. 
It goes straight to the heart.

985
01:46:00.295 --> 01:46:02.990
It is the same
poison that killed my master.

986
01:46:03.013 --> 01:46:05.557
The blood, at first, slows down.

987
01:46:07.268 --> 01:46:10.270
And then, gradually, its entire flow is reversed.

988
01:46:11.939 --> 01:46:13.523
There is no antidote.

989
01:46:13.607 --> 01:46:16.191
There has to be. There has to.

990
01:46:16.776 --> 01:46:19.946
There is always an opposite
to everything. Why not this?

991
01:46:20.781 --> 01:46:23.533
Well, there is, in fact. 
She taught it to me.

992
01:46:24.035 --> 01:46:28.455
The ingredients aren't hard to find but it takes time to prepare. 
But it does exist.

993
01:46:35.463 --> 01:46:37.130
Please, trust me.

994
01:46:37.631 --> 01:46:40.800
Let me do what I can,
as a way to repay you.

995
01:46:43.471 --> 01:46:45.430
All right, it's worth it.

996
01:46:45.973 --> 01:46:48.224
I will try to resist
just as long as I can.

997
01:46:48.309 --> 01:46:50.894
Take my horse to the
warehouse and ask for Wú Mā.

998
01:46:50.978 --> 01:46:53.480
Give her this -
she'll help you. Now go!

999
01:46:53.939 --> 01:46:57.317
Save your energy. 
I will come back.

1000
01:47:22.927 --> 01:47:24.344
MAN: You again! 
Where are you going?

1001
01:47:25.513 --> 01:47:26.805
(PEOPLE YELLING)

1002
01:47:26.889 --> 01:47:29.390
Wú Mā! Where is she? Wú Mā!

1003
01:47:29.475 --> 01:47:30.809
No, wait, no! Let her speak!

1004
01:47:32.186 --> 01:47:34.979
Xiùlián said you'd help us.

1005
01:47:36.107 --> 01:47:37.816
Let her in!

1006
01:47:51.705 --> 01:47:54.040
Mùbái, give me some hope.

1007
01:47:58.546 --> 01:48:00.338
Do not desert me.

1008
01:48:25.239 --> 01:48:26.656
Xiùlián.

1009
01:48:26.740 --> 01:48:28.158
(SHUSHING)

1010
01:48:28.242 --> 01:48:30.326
Don't waste your strength.

1011
01:48:32.246 --> 01:48:34.205
I feel life going.

1012
01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.084
Feel I've one last breath left.

1013
01:48:40.588 --> 01:48:43.256
Use the strength you have left to meditate.

1014
01:48:43.757 --> 01:48:48.261
Do things as you were taught
and free yourself from the world.

1015
01:48:49.889 --> 01:48:54.058
Use your last breath to
let your soul rise to eternity.

1016
01:48:56.228 --> 01:48:59.397
I am too worthless for
you to waste it on.

1017
01:49:02.860 --> 01:49:05.445
I have wasted my entire life

1018
01:49:06.780 --> 01:49:09.616
but I did find enlightenment

1019
01:49:11.452 --> 01:49:13.786
when at last I realized

1020
01:49:14.252 --> 01:49:16.686
that I love you.

1021
01:49:49.573 --> 01:49:53.493
I'd rather be a ghost,
floating at your side, seven days

1022
01:49:54.912 --> 01:49:56.746
and be together

1023
01:49:59.500 --> 01:50:02.752
than enter heaven without you.

1024
01:50:05.297 --> 01:50:06.506
My love for you

1025
01:50:10.094 --> 01:50:13.972
will always keep me
from being a lonely spirit.

1026
01:50:22.773 --> 01:50:25.191
(WHlMPERING)

1027
01:51:10.112 --> 01:51:11.571
It's too late?

1028
01:51:40.893 --> 01:51:42.435
*Jiāo?

1029
01:51:43.103 --> 01:51:45.730
Take this, and return it to Bèi-lèyé.

1030
01:51:52.946 --> 01:51:57.200
Now, go to Wudang Mountain. 
Xiǎohǔ awaits you there.

1031
01:51:58.660 --> 01:52:02.914
And Jiāolóng, promise that whatever
path you take in this life,

1032
01:52:04.083 --> 01:52:05.917
you will always be true to yourself.

1033
01:52:53.674 --> 01:52:54.841
Jiāolóng!

1034
01:53:39.386 --> 01:53:40.845
Where is the girl?
- She went down there.


1035
01:53:55.694 --> 01:53:56.777
Jiāolóng.

1036
01:54:00.449 --> 01:54:03.117
That legend with the saying about
the young man and the mountain?

1037
01:54:04.512 --> 01:54:08.414
That he will have his...
- His wishes granted.


1038
01:54:14.630 --> 01:54:16.380
Make a wish, Xiǎohǔ.

1039
01:54:18.926 --> 01:54:22.428
That we return to the desert.
