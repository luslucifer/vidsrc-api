You're doing other people's ideas.

- I'd rather be in control.

as a primary school teacher.

Shh.

Give it three years and if you're
as bad as you are now, give up.

Try. Those who can't act, teach.

25
00:01:54.736 --> 00:01:57.738
And those who can't teach,
teach primary.

- It's a truism.

Now, last year,
Mrs Spink did the nativity play,


62

and, if you remember,
she got a bit upset


63
00:04:12.415 --> 00:04:14.416
and she started shouting and crying

64
00:04:14.542 --> 00:04:18.045
and some of you, I remember,
were crying with her.

So, we are going to have to find
a new person,

and this year, to make the best
nativity play that has ever, ever been,

00:05:14.394 --> 00:05:18.855
Mrs Bevan, I did a three-year course
in drama many moons ago.


79
00:05:18.981 --> 00:05:22.567
- I wasn't very good.
- Yes, I know. Let's move on from there.

00:05:22.693 --> 00:05:24.986
When are you going
to start the casting?


81
00:05:25.113 --> 00:05:27.781
These children are literally useless.

82
00:05:27.907 --> 00:05:31.410
I am literally useless.
Please don't make me do this.


83
00:05:31.536 --> 00:05:35.747
Think about Oakmoor. Think about
how they always steal all the reviews.


84
00:05:35.873 --> 00:05:37.290
We agreed four years ago

85
00:05:37.417 --> 00:05:41.962
that after my disastrous attempt to direct
the nativity, I wouldn't do it again.


86
00:05:42.088 --> 00:05:47.092
Make this a good one, make this
a fabulous last nativity play for me,


87
00:05:47.218 --> 00:05:50.429
and then I retire and you won't
have to put up with me any more.


88
00:05:50.555 --> 00:05:55.350
Oh, and you've got a classroom
assistant starting today some time.


89
00:05:55.476 --> 00:05:58.728
- Thank you.
- That will help with the stress.


90
00:06:14.328 --> 00:06:17.038
- Hello.
- Hello.


91
00:06:18.207 --> 00:06:22.878
Tell us, clearly, what happened at
Christmas, if you think you're so clever.


92
00:06:23.004 --> 00:06:26.756
Joseph got together with Mary and then
Mary went to Bethlehem to have a baby.


93
00:06:26.883 --> 00:06:28.758
She has a baby, Jesus.

94
00:06:28.885 --> 00:06:33.847
A couple of years later, about 30 years
later, he dies on the cross and then...


95
00:06:33.973 --> 00:06:38.894
Go and sit down. That was almost
blasphemy, what you've just done.


96
00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:40.729
Here's to a five-star review

00:10:01.972 --> 00:10:04.641
Bark for low.

151
00:10:04.767 --> 00:10:07.977
Suit yourself.

152
00:10:09.146 --> 00:10:10.897
Cracker.

153
00:10:11.023 --> 00:10:14.192
Cracker. Cracker, come here.

154
00:10:20.199 --> 00:10:22.283
Help me, Mr Maddens!

155
00:10:23.911 --> 00:10:27.414
This man is an idiot.
He's an actual village idiot.


156
00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:29.708
If this was a village,
he would be the idiot.


157
00:10:29.834 --> 00:10:33.503
He's not a classroom assistant.
He's an absolute calamitous fool.


158
00:10:33.629 --> 00:10:37.298
- He'll be a big help with the play.
- The play that I don't care about?


159
00:10:37.425 --> 00:10:41.469
The play that brings the children away
from learning to read, write and count?


160
00:10:41.595 --> 00:10:45.348
Whoopee. I've got a big oaf helping
my children to fail. Thanks a lot.


161
00:10:45.474 --> 00:10:48.435
- This is getting a bit personal.
- Who's that?


162
00:10:48.561 --> 00:10:50.145
- Who's what?
- What's that?


163
00:10:50.271 --> 00:10:53.022
That's a photograph
of me and Mr Poppy.


164
00:10:53.149 --> 00:10:56.359
- Why?
- He is my sister's son.


165
00:10:56.485 --> 00:10:58.570
Mm-hm.

166
00:11:07.121 --> 00:11:11.750
Mr Poppy!

167
00:11:11.876 --> 00:11:14.377
Sit down, please. Sit down.

168
00:11:14.503 --> 00:11:16.629
Be quiet! Sit down now!

169
00:11:22.011 --> 00:11:24.429
Why is Mr Maddens
such a grumpy grocks?


170
00:11:24.555 --> 00:11:27.807
His girlfriend left him at Christmas time.

171
00:11:27.933 --> 00:11:31.561
- Where's his girlfriend now?
- In America.


172
00:11:31.687 --> 00:11:34.147
America, how cool is that?

173
00:11:34.273 --> 00:11:37.901
It is cool,
but it is a long way away from here.


174
00:11:38.027 --> 00:11:41.571
Can we keep it down over there,
please?


175
00:11:44.033 --> 00:11:46.159
- Bagsy drive the van.
- I've got the keys.


176
00:11:46.285 --> 00:11:48.745
- Nothing overrules the rules of bagsy.
- Don't...


177
00:11:48.871 --> 00:11:53.792
- Mr Poppy, I'm insured to drive the van.
- Auntie Pat said I could drive.


178
00:11:53.918 --> 00:11:57.003
- Can you drive?
- Yeah. Come on, jump in.


179
00:11:59.465 --> 00:12:02.467
- Gabriel comes in on a death slide.
- What's a death slide?


180
00:12:02.593 --> 00:12:05.804
One of those things. Duh-zzhoozh!
You go down with two hands...


181
00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:10.183
I don't think health and safety will
involve the death slide in a nativity play.


182
00:12:10.309 --> 00:12:15.396
- OK, what about a BMX with trick pegs?
- This is a Roman Catholic school.


183
00:12:15.523 --> 00:12:19.526
We are not going to replace a donkey
with a trick-peg BMX. What is that?


184
00:12:19.652 --> 00:12:22.529
- We can do it if we just work together.
- Sorry?


185
00:12:22.655 --> 00:12:27.033
Like we're Webber and Rice, and Posh
and Becks. Jackie Chan and Bruce Lee.


186
00:12:27.159 --> 00:12:28.701
You and me.

187
00:12:28.828 --> 00:12:32.872
- I think maybe this one.
- No. The big one.


188
00:12:32.998 --> 00:12:35.083
It's not gonna fit, is it?

189
00:12:35.209 --> 00:12:39.170
- I don't believe it! Paul Maddens!
- Gordon Shakespeare.


190
00:12:39.296 --> 00:12:43.132
How are you doing, my man?

191
00:12:44.468 --> 00:12:46.302
- Great to see you.
- And you.


192
00:12:46.428 --> 00:12:49.389
- Where have you been?
- Five years at St Bernadette's now.


193
00:12:49.515 --> 00:12:52.517
But you were gonna be the star,
the man!


194
00:12:52.643 --> 00:12:56.938
- Was I? I never thought that.
- Yes! We all did and then it all went.


195
00:12:57.064 --> 00:13:00.149
And now you're down the road?
How is it at St B's?


196
00:13:00.276 --> 00:13:01.860
Goodness me, what a challenge!

197
00:13:01.986 --> 00:13:07.031
Slowly, that dreadful school
is dragging itself up.


198
00:13:07.157 --> 00:13:12.036
- How's Jennifer? Do you speak to her?
- Yeah, still quite good friends with her.


199
00:13:12.162 --> 00:13:13.955
So, you still keep in touch with her?

200
00:13:14.081 --> 00:13:16.749
Yeah, even though
she's Hollywood side, yeah.


201
00:13:16.876 --> 00:13:19.460
- Didn't she do well?
- She's now a producer, you know?


202
00:13:19.587 --> 00:13:24.257
I know. I mean, if you think I'm talented,
well, she's just gone to another level.


203
00:13:24.383 --> 00:13:26.843
Way above me, and... and...

204
00:13:26.969 --> 00:13:29.345
- ... clearly, you.
- Clearly, yeah.


205
00:13:29.471 --> 00:13:31.973
If you want to see
how the other half lives,


206
00:13:32.099 --> 00:13:35.560
and just see where
it really happens in the right way,


207
00:13:35.686 --> 00:13:37.312
come along to our Christmas bazaar.

208
00:13:37.438 --> 00:13:40.940
- The talent they've got. Amazing.
- Yeah, I'm sure.


209
00:13:41.066 --> 00:13:43.610
- It's worth a little look. Come along.
- Thank you.


210
00:13:43.736 --> 00:13:46.070
- What are you doing this year?
- I'm doing the nativity again.


211
00:13:46.196 --> 00:13:49.324
- Perhaps I could come and see yours?
- Yes, you won't be alone if you do.


212
00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:51.784
Because, actually, 
Jennifer's coming.

213
00:13:51.911 --> 00:13:55.830
- She's coming over to the UK?
- Yeah, she's gonna come and see...


214
00:13:55.956 --> 00:13:57.290
Why would she do that?

215
00:13:57.416 --> 00:14:00.335
Because she's gonna bring
most of her agency over with her.


216
00:14:00.461 --> 00:14:05.131
Hollywood... are coming
to St Bernadette's?


217
00:14:05.257 --> 00:14:06.883
- To see your show?
- Yes.


218
00:14:07.009 --> 00:14:08.676
- To film your show?
- Yeah.


219
00:14:08.802 --> 00:14:12.180
- To make a film out of it?
- Yeah.


220
00:14:12.306 --> 00:14:13.556
And a book.

221
00:14:27.738 --> 00:14:29.864
Come, come, come, come, come.

222
00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:33.034
Come close. This is... Shh.

223
00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:36.663
Come in, gather round.
I've got something to tell you, all right?


224
00:14:36.789 --> 00:14:41.918
I'm not supposed to, but someone's
twisted my arm and I have to tell you.


225
00:14:42.044 --> 00:14:45.588
I've just been to get the Christmas tree,
and I heard Mr Maddens say,


226
00:14:45.714 --> 00:14:50.426
a big Hollywood
production film thing company


227
00:14:50.552 --> 00:14:52.845
are coming here to see our nativity,

228
00:14:52.972 --> 00:14:56.391
but it's not a nativity,
it's "Nativity The Musical",


229
00:14:56.517 --> 00:15:00.436
in 3-D with 5-D sound,
and we're all going to be famous!


230
00:15:00.562 --> 00:15:02.355
Yeah!

231
00:15:04.149 --> 00:15:07.360
Shh, shh, shh!
This is big stuff, all right?


232
00:15:07.486 --> 00:15:09.612
Zack, I mean, you could end up being...

233
00:15:09.738 --> 00:15:12.240
- Zac Efron.
- Yes!


234
00:15:12.366 --> 00:15:15.493
And you... you could be Shrek!

235
00:15:15.619 --> 00:15:18.121
- And you, Bob...
- What?


236
00:15:18.247 --> 00:15:21.874
...you're like a little Gollum,
like a little creature in something!


237
00:15:22.001 --> 00:15:25.628
So, we're going to be super famous
because Hollywood are coming!


238
00:15:25.754 --> 00:15:26.796
Yeah!

239
00:15:31.468 --> 00:15:32.969
Ow. Ow.

240
00:15:33.095 --> 00:15:35.013
Ow!

241
00:15:35.139 --> 00:15:37.557
Oh!

242
00:15:37.683 --> 00:15:39.350
Aargh!

243
00:15:39.476 --> 00:15:41.811
With me now
are the real stars of the film,


244
00:15:41.937 --> 00:15:45.064
the pupils
of St Bernadette's School here.


245
00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:49.027
- You must be very excited?
- Oh, very excited, aren't we, children?


246
00:15:51.155 --> 00:15:52.905
Wait, wait.

247
00:15:53.032 --> 00:15:57.326
We heard this morning that Hollywood
are coming to see our nativity play,


248
00:15:57.453 --> 00:15:58.953
and we can hardly believe it.

249
00:15:59.079 --> 00:16:01.581
Sit down, please. Sit, Cracker.

250
00:16:01.707 --> 00:16:08.254
I am actually Mr Poppy and I am, er...
the co-director, co-writer, co-producer.


251
00:16:15.429 --> 00:16:19.474
'... the true stars of a new Hollywood
blockbuster coming to town very soon. '


252
00:16:22.936 --> 00:16:26.230
(♪ He sees you when you're sleeping

253
00:16:26.356 --> 00:16:29.525
(♪ He knows when you're awake...

254
00:16:30.903 --> 00:16:33.196
How you doing, Paul?

255
00:16:35.199 --> 00:16:37.950
Now, you don't want to be late.
Quickly, you two.


256
00:16:38.077 --> 00:16:41.412
Well done.
Congratulations, Mr Maddens.


257
00:16:44.792 --> 00:16:48.336
There you are! 
Oh, goodness, at last.

258
00:16:48.462 --> 00:16:51.839
- This is Darren from the newspaper.
- Nice to meet you.


259
00:16:51.965 --> 00:16:55.635
Come on, we've got to go this way.
Yeah, they've been waiting.


260
00:16:55.761 --> 00:16:59.097
I've told Darren everything I know
but I don't know much.


261
00:16:59.223 --> 00:17:02.100
It's wonderful that you're
back in touch with her again.


262
00:17:02.226 --> 00:17:06.229
There you are, that's it.

263
00:17:11.527 --> 00:17:16.656
Thank you, thank you. Good morning,
boys and girls. Good morning, teachers.


264
00:17:16.782 --> 00:17:20.618
Good morning. Good morning,
gentlemen of the press.


265
00:17:20.744 --> 00:17:23.746
Ha-ha! And the local news team.

266
00:17:23.872 --> 00:17:27.333
And, as you can see, children,
it's very, very exciting.


267
00:17:27.459 --> 00:17:31.587
The whole of the town
is buzzing with the news


268
00:17:31.713 --> 00:17:37.677
that St Bernadette's is going
to get a visitor from Hollywood.


269
00:17:37.803 --> 00:17:40.680
- Three cheers for Mr Maddens! Hip, hip!
- Hurray!


270
00:17:40.806 --> 00:17:42.557
- Hip, hip!
- Hurray!


271
00:17:42.683 --> 00:17:46.060
- Hip, hip!
- Hooray!


272
00:17:46.186 --> 00:17:49.522
Mrs Bevan, boys and girls...

273
00:17:49.648 --> 00:17:55.194
I'm sorry, cos there's obviously
been some misunderstanding,


274
00:17:55.320 --> 00:18:00.324
because yesterday
I said in front of Mr Poppy


275
00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:05.371
that we were gonna have a...
a visit from Hollywood.


276
00:18:10.836 --> 00:18:13.796
And I'm only sorry
cos it's not happening right now!


277
00:18:25.726 --> 00:18:27.768
I didn't tell you.

278
00:18:27.895 --> 00:18:30.688
I told Gordon Shakespeare!
It wasn't even for your ears!


279
00:18:30.814 --> 00:18:33.983
Do you understand me? You were
eavesdropping on a conversation.


280
00:18:34.109 --> 00:18:37.195
- It doesn't matter!
- Be quiet! It's obviously a lie.


281
00:18:37.321 --> 00:18:40.573
How are Hollywood
gonna come to the school?


282
00:18:40.699 --> 00:18:44.827
It's a lie! It's not
true! I made it up!

283
00:18:46.246 --> 00:18:48.164
You have messed up, right?

284
00:18:48.290 --> 00:18:53.252
It's up to you to face your responsibility
and go out there and tell them it's a lie.


285
00:18:53.378 --> 00:18:56.964
Yeah!

286
00:19:00.427 --> 00:19:02.428
Yeah!

287
00:19:03.931 --> 00:19:06.474
All you've got to do
is call your girlfriend


288
00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:08.351
and get the Hollywood people across.

289
00:19:08.477 --> 00:19:12.480
One problem. She's not my girlfriend.
I don't know her number.


290
00:19:12.606 --> 00:19:16.400
I don't know where she lives.
I was making all of that up yesterday.


291
00:19:16.526 --> 00:19:21.781
- Family? Has she got any family?
- Well, she's got parents, yeah.


292
00:19:21.907 --> 00:19:24.700
- Do you have any pets?
- I have a dog. Used to be hers.


293
00:19:24.826 --> 00:19:27.495
Brilliant! Just go round there.

294
00:19:27.621 --> 00:19:31.832
Say, "The dog died. I need her number.
I should break her this news in person. "


295
00:19:31.959 --> 00:19:35.836
- How has the dog died?
- It blew up.


296
00:19:35.963 --> 00:19:38.589
The dog blew up!

297
00:19:38.715 --> 00:19:42.635
They won't ask! They won't ask.
You wouldn't ask. I wouldn't ask.


298
00:19:42.761 --> 00:19:45.763
"Eugh!" They'd just think "Eugh"
and get the number.


299
00:19:55.649 --> 00:20:00.069
We need those five stars. I need you all
to be stars to get those stars.


300
00:20:00.195 --> 00:20:04.323
We need something edgier,
more dangerous, something darker.


301
00:20:04.449 --> 00:20:09.203
Something like the RSC do, then bang,
they hit you with something enormous.


302
00:20:09.329 --> 00:20:13.207
That's what we should be doing.
Something European, strange, exotic.


303
00:20:13.333 --> 00:20:16.252
Something that the Americans
don't understand but love.


304
00:20:16.378 --> 00:20:20.298
That's it, I know, we could have... Herod.

305
00:20:20.424 --> 00:20:24.427
King Herod, he's never done, is he?
Herod... Herod's never done, ever!


306
00:20:24.553 --> 00:20:28.431
That's it, wonderful. We can have
Herod. It could be like an opera.


307
00:20:28.557 --> 00:20:31.183
This dark shape brooding in the back,

308
00:20:31.310 --> 00:20:35.438
coming forward onto the stage,
singing his heart out, his lungs,


309
00:20:35.564 --> 00:20:38.357
craving for their minds and blood
and body of the children.


310
00:20:38.483 --> 00:20:41.569
That's what we want.
Who's going to be my Herod?


311
00:20:47.075 --> 00:20:52.288

you'd like to show us?

I know you're not gonna let me,
but I want to be Joseph.


327
00:22:07.155 --> 00:22:09.490
OK, well, away you go,
in your own time.


328
00:22:11.952 --> 00:22:15.079
- Careful.
- Wow.


329
00:22:23.922 --> 00:22:26.674
- You're through to the next round.
- There's not a next round.


330
00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:29.510
- The Hollywood round.
- There isn't a Hollywood round.


331
00:22:29.636 --> 00:22:32.012
Please can I go to Hollywood? Please!

332
00:22:32.139 --> 00:22:34.765
Hollywood, Bob, are gonna love it.

333
00:22:35.809 --> 00:22:38.018
Aah! Ooh!

334
00:22:38.145 --> 00:22:41.439
Look, I can't do it.
Can we take five for a moment, please?


335
00:22:41.565 --> 00:22:44.233
I've got to... Excuse me.

336
00:22:47.946 --> 00:22:50.322
Keep going, it's good. 
It's really good.

337
00:22:53.034 --> 00:22:56.245
- Paul. Paul. Paul.
- Oh, hello, Father.


338
00:22:56.371 --> 00:22:59.415
I just popped in to congratulate you.
Well done.


339
00:22:59.541 --> 00:23:01.709
- Thank you.
- It's great news.


340
00:23:01.835 --> 00:23:04.211
- Thank you. I'll do what I can.
- Well done.


341
00:23:04.337 --> 00:23:06.338
Father, could I ask your advice?

342
00:23:06.465 --> 00:23:10.843
I've just had a bit of a query from one
of the children in the auditions, actually.


343
00:23:10.969 --> 00:23:15.139
I'm not sure how to advise them.
They're worried about, er... lying.


344
00:23:15.265 --> 00:23:16.807
One of them has told a lie.

345
00:23:16.933 --> 00:23:19.727
We all know that there's
such a thing as a little white lie


346
00:23:19.853 --> 00:23:24.440
and there's a black Protestant lie,
which is more serious, you know...


347
00:23:24.566 --> 00:23:28.027
I don't think so, I don't think so.
A lie is a lie is a lie.


348
00:23:28.153 --> 00:23:30.654
- Technically?
- What do you mean, technically?


349
00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:35.117
Well, you know, "Is that a nice meal?"
"Oh, yes, Mrs Johnson, it's lovely. "


350
00:23:35.243 --> 00:23:39.079
Even though you're feeling sick,
cos you don't want to hurt her feelings.


351
00:23:39.206 --> 00:23:43.834
- But it's still a lie, isn't it?
- But I'm not going to be punished for it.


352
00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:46.462
No, but if you picked the woman up
on her bad cooking,


353
00:23:46.588 --> 00:23:50.299
the next time
you might get a decent meal.


354
00:24:00.268 --> 00:24:05.397
Ee-aah! Ee-aah!

355
00:24:07.150 --> 00:24:11.654
- Mrs Bevan, can I have a quick word?
- Ah! My phone is ringing off the hook.


356
00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:14.156
- Can I grab you for two minutes?
- Of course.


357
00:24:14.282 --> 00:24:18.619
Word has got out about the Hollywood
connection, and parents are ringing me.


358
00:24:18.745 --> 00:24:23.082
- They want to know why, how, when.
- I can save time with all of that.


359
00:24:23.208 --> 00:24:26.877
This is the cherry on the cake,
the Lord Mayor's office has rung


360
00:24:27.003 --> 00:24:31.298
and they want you to go to a big
reception for Coventry ambassadors.


361
00:24:31.424 --> 00:24:35.594
- No!
- Yes, and there's going to be drinks.


362
00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:38.264
- I don't think I can come.
- I've accepted on your behalf.


363
00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:39.723
Have you?

364
00:24:39.849 --> 00:24:41.934
- I've got to go. Phone!
- No, please!


365
00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:47.064
That will be somebody else.
See you soon, bye-bye.

371
00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:11.547
- I wonder if I might come in?
- I think you should come in.

- Come on.


373
00:25:22.017 --> 00:25:24.059
You'd better sit down, Paul.

374
00:25:24.185 --> 00:25:26.395
I've heard of some things
in my life, Paul,


375
00:25:26.521 --> 00:25:29.189
but to take a dog called Cracker

376
00:25:29.316 --> 00:25:33.569
and then to put explosives in it
and blow it apart like a cracker...


377
00:25:33.695 --> 00:25:36.780
I think common parlance is "the pits".

378
00:25:36.906 --> 00:25:38.949
Wait till Jennifer hears.

379
00:25:39.075 --> 00:25:42.244
Yes, she'll probably be sitting there
in her heart-shaped pool,


380
00:25:42.370 --> 00:25:45.497
sipping away at her Cristal champagne
which Harrison has bought her.


381
00:25:45.624 --> 00:25:49.001
That's her new boyfriend, by the way.

382
00:25:49.127 --> 00:25:51.337
New boyfriend, you understand that?

383
00:25:51.463 --> 00:25:54.423
Not the old boyfriend
who blows dogs to smithereens.

- What did she say?
- I haven't spoken to her yet.


387
00:26:07.062 --> 00:26:10.064
- When are you going to phone her?
- When I've got time!


388
00:26:10.190 --> 00:26:13.359
And just when I've worked out
what it is I'm gonna say!


389
00:26:13.485 --> 00:26:15.944
Phone her!
Why don't you want to phone her?


390
00:26:16.071 --> 00:26:19.698
I can't phone her now
because I'm working. I'm marking.


391
00:26:19.824 --> 00:26:22.951
You're worried. You were
going out with her for a long time.


392

You love her,
she loved you, it went wrong,


393

tummy when you make the phone call.

need to take a big daddy breath,

what you think is going on.

I've not seen for five years. I'm not.

Well, I can see a man who's really
scared and frightened and angry.


399
00:26:48.103 --> 00:26:51.188
I'm frightened of you, because
I've never met one of you before.


400
00:26:51.314 --> 00:26:55.192
I'm terrified because I don't know
what you or I am going to do.

I could help you mend your heart,

I thought there was a wonderful
array of talent on display,

so you can all be
very proud of yourselves.

of talent on display,

00:29:27.136 --> 00:29:31.515
Black! Darkness, and the audience
is thinking, "What's going to happen?"


441
00:29:31.641 --> 00:29:35.060
Some of the children,
maybe like six or seven,


442
00:29:35.186 --> 00:29:37.729
come on here on that,
"Duh-duh, duh-duh-duh!"


443
00:29:37.856 --> 00:29:39.731
They're like toe, heel,

444
00:29:39.858 --> 00:29:43.402
and then over here some more children,
so you get this big cross,


445
00:29:43.528 --> 00:29:47.489
and at the back as the cross opens up
we see like the city of Nazareth.


446
00:29:47.615 --> 00:29:50.909
The children turn round,
they've got big cutouts of all the city,


447
00:29:51.035 --> 00:29:54.371
the city comes together
and there's windows and lights


448
00:29:54.497 --> 00:29:57.040
and people going "Hello"
through the windows.


449
00:29:57.166 --> 00:30:01.295
Mr Poppy, these children
will never be able to do that.


450
00:30:01.421 --> 00:30:05.132
- Yes, they will.
- Everyone knows we're useless.


451
00:30:05.258 --> 00:30:08.010
- You're not useless.
- That's what Mr Maddens calls us.


452
00:30:08.136 --> 00:30:12.973
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.


453
00:30:13.099 --> 00:30:15.100
You told Mrs Bevan that we are.

454
00:30:15.226 --> 00:30:18.103
- Who told you that?
- Sam, she heard you.


455
00:30:18.229 --> 00:30:20.647
You did say we were useless.

456
00:30:20.773 --> 00:30:24.401
I didn't mean useless.
I didn't mean useless.


457
00:30:25.904 --> 00:30:28.864
- But they will never be able to do that.
- Yeah, they will.


458
00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:33.035
Anything we can do,
Oakmoor can do ten times better.


459
00:30:33.161 --> 00:30:35.871
Oli, Oakmoor, shmoakmoor!

460
00:30:35.997 --> 00:30:38.373
(♪ Beh-beh-beh-beh, beh-beh-beh-beh...

461
00:30:38.499 --> 00:30:43.128
The final scene of the play
is a really, really important scene.


462
00:30:43.254 --> 00:30:46.673
- You know what happens at the end?
- No.


463
00:30:46.799 --> 00:30:49.801
- Baby Jesus is born.
- Baby Jesus is born.


464
00:30:49.928 --> 00:30:54.348
Right, who fancies
going on a little field trip


465
00:30:54.474 --> 00:30:58.018
to actually see a real baby being born?

466
00:30:58.144 --> 00:31:01.438
Ah, I've been looking for you, my class.
What are we all doing?


467
00:31:01.564 --> 00:31:05.317
We're talking about going on a field trip
to see a baby being born.


468
00:31:05.443 --> 00:31:08.320
- What do you mean?
- It would be good to do a few field trips.


469
00:31:08.446 --> 00:31:10.447
Go to the farm and see some animals,

470
00:31:10.573 --> 00:31:14.451
because it would be cool for you to see
the animals that come to the manger.


471
00:31:14.577 --> 00:31:16.620
Thank you. Can we come in, please?

472
00:31:16.746 --> 00:31:19.539
Enough of this silliness.
It's not gonna happen.


473
00:31:19.666 --> 00:31:23.710
How are they supposed to give
convincing performances?


474
00:31:23.836 --> 00:31:28.131
It's called pretending. It's what every
child in every nativity does every year.


475
00:31:28.257 --> 00:31:31.009
You can't pretend something
unless you've experienced it.


476
00:31:31.135 --> 00:31:33.595
I'm pretending to like you
and I've yet to experience that.


477
00:31:33.721 --> 00:31:37.349
Who wants to go to hospital
and see a baby being born?


478
00:31:41.479 --> 00:31:44.940
- (♪ Hey, hey!
- (♪ I woke up to the radio


479
00:31:45.066 --> 00:31:48.527
(♪ And the glare
of a blanket of fallen snow


480
00:31:48.653 --> 00:31:51.196
(♪ When I heard
the DJ speak to me

481
00:31:51.322 --> 00:31:53.991

Thick as an evergreen...


482
00:32:00.415 --> 00:32:04.001
(♪ For a snowy day

483
00:32:04.127 --> 00:32:10.173
(♪ Cos I need a break
And I want to sleigh the day away


484
00:32:11.467 --> 00:32:13.927
(♪ I need a snow day...

485
00:32:14.053 --> 00:32:16.930
Oh, piglets!

486
00:32:17.515 --> 00:32:23.437
(♪ I need a snow day

487
00:32:23.563 --> 00:32:25.188
(♪ Hey, hey! (♪

488
00:32:25.314 --> 00:32:26.606
Hello, everybody.

489
00:32:26.733 --> 00:32:31.278
I'd like to welcome you to our Christmas
bazaar here at Oakmoor School.


490
00:32:31.404 --> 00:32:33.947
As you know,
Christmas is a time for giving.


491
00:32:34.073 --> 00:32:40.162
A time for charity and valuing those
people less fortunate than ourselves.


492
00:32:40.288 --> 00:32:44.958
So, in that spirit, I'd like to welcome the
students from St Bernadette's School.


493
00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:52.591
(♪ Ding dong! 
Merrily on high

494
00:32:52.717 --> 00:32:56.386
- (♪ In heaven the bells are ringing
- (♪ Oh, oh!


495
00:32:56.512 --> 00:32:59.598
- (♪ Ding dong verily the sky
- (♪ Oh, oh!


496
00:32:59.724 --> 00:33:03.143

- (♪ Oh, oh!


497
00:33:03.269 --> 00:33:09.357
- (♪ Gloria
- (♪ Ding dong! Ding dong! Ding dong!


498
00:33:09.484 --> 00:33:13.361
(♪ Ding dong! Ding dong! Ding dong!

499
00:33:13.488 --> 00:33:17.574
(♪ Hosanna in excelsis (♪

500
00:33:19.702 --> 00:33:21.161
That was good.

501
00:33:29.212 --> 00:33:32.672
- They look beautiful.
- We're never gonna beat them.


502
00:33:41.599 --> 00:33:43.391
Wow.

503
00:33:45.603 --> 00:33:49.022
- Wow, he's good, isn't he?
- Yeah.


504
00:33:50.525 --> 00:33:51.983
Oh...

505
00:33:55.613 --> 00:33:57.656
Look at him.

506
00:34:11.003 --> 00:34:14.297
How are we? Are we all right?
Are we ready to give it a go?


507
00:34:14.423 --> 00:34:18.093
OK, we know it a little bit. Listen,
this doesn't matter. It's not a test.


508
00:34:18.219 --> 00:34:20.262
You don't have to be getting this right.

509
00:34:20.388 --> 00:34:23.098
This is just something we do
cos we enjoy singing.


510
00:34:23.224 --> 00:34:26.560
Just to give us an idea
of a Mary and Joseph, OK?


511
00:34:26.686 --> 00:34:30.605
- Mr Poppy, if you would, please.
- Two, three.


512
00:34:30.731 --> 00:34:34.734
(♪ He's not my type

513
00:34:34.861 --> 00:34:39.030
(♪ She's not too bad

514
00:34:39.824 --> 00:34:42.450
(♪ Not the most gorgeous

515
00:34:42.577 --> 00:34:46.830
(♪ I've ever had

516
00:34:46.956 --> 00:34:50.417
(♪ And yet there's something

517
00:34:50.543 --> 00:34:54.379
(♪ Behind those eyes

518
00:34:54.505 --> 00:34:58.842
(♪ A fire that flickers... (♪

519
00:35:06.976 --> 00:35:09.561
What's going on here?

520
00:35:09.687 --> 00:35:12.564
Oli and Alfie, did I see you fighting?

521
00:35:15.484 --> 00:35:17.360
Why were you fighting?

522
00:35:17.486 --> 00:35:21.198
He said I'd be rubbish at Joseph,
and I'll never make it in the school play,


523
00:35:21.324 --> 00:35:24.367
and if I do, I
would let the school down.

524
00:35:24.493 --> 00:35:29.456
- Alfie, who made you director?
- No one. But... but he hit me.


525
00:35:29.582 --> 00:35:31.917
Alfie, it's not down to you

526
00:35:32.043 --> 00:35:34.586
who's going to be rubbish or good
or let the school down.


527
00:35:34.712 --> 00:35:37.589
As far as I'm concerned
you've just let the school down,


528
00:35:37.715 --> 00:35:39.799
and so have you, Oli.

529
00:35:39.926 --> 00:35:42.928
- You both want to try out for Joseph?
- Yes, Mr Maddens.


530
00:35:43.054 --> 00:35:46.223
Yeah? Neither of you are going to.
Sit down.


531
00:35:46.349 --> 00:35:49.601
I knew you'd never let me.

532
00:35:52.396 --> 00:35:55.649
Jade, do you want
to come and try for Mary?


533
00:35:55.775 --> 00:35:58.485
- Oli?
- Yes, Mr Maddens?


534
00:35:58.611 --> 00:36:01.738
Take your feet off the seat.

535
00:36:05.326 --> 00:36:08.620
- Come and try for Joseph, come on.
- Thank you, Mr Maddens.


536
00:36:08.746 --> 00:36:13.041
(♪ I'll grow to love her

537
00:36:13.167 --> 00:36:16.378
(♪ It might work out

538
00:36:16.504 --> 00:36:19.631
(♪ Too young to know

539
00:36:19.757 --> 00:36:23.343
(♪ What it's all about...

540
00:36:23.469 --> 00:36:28.473
This one I'm quite excited about, but it is
a bit of a risk. That could go either way.


541
00:36:28.599 --> 00:36:31.601
But if you don't like it, you can just say.
You can just say.


542
00:36:31.727 --> 00:36:35.647
Hang on, what's down here?

543
00:36:35.773 --> 00:36:38.316
I think I've just found...

544
00:36:38.442 --> 00:36:41.611
What's...

545
00:36:45.324 --> 00:36:49.286
(♪ Together forever

546
00:36:49.412 --> 00:36:52.539
(♪ And always home

547
00:36:52.665 --> 00:36:56.668
- (♪ Together forever...
- Other hand. Other hands.


548
00:36:56.794 --> 00:36:59.045
(♪ And always

549
00:36:59.171 --> 00:37:03.633
(♪ Always home (♪

550
00:37:03.759 --> 00:37:05.593
And kiss.

551
00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:08.179
- No.
- They don't have to kiss.


552
00:37:08.306 --> 00:37:10.515
They don't have to kiss.

553
00:37:10.641 --> 00:37:13.601
- What about just a cuddle?
- Jade, Oli, come here.


554
00:37:16.772 --> 00:37:18.732
- That was excellent.
- Thank you.


555
00:37:18.858 --> 00:37:22.944
You've got a beautiful voice. And Oli?

556
00:37:23.070 --> 00:37:26.906
- That was really good.
- Thank you, Mr Maddens.


557
00:37:27.033 --> 00:37:31.536
- So, what was all that about earlier?
- Alfie really got on my nerves.


558
00:37:31.662 --> 00:37:36.041
But I don't care if someone's getting
on your nerves, you don't fight them.


559
00:37:36.167 --> 00:37:38.752
People think you're a bad lad,
and maybe you're not,


560
00:37:38.878 --> 00:37:42.964
but the more bad things you do,
people have you marked down as that.


561
00:37:43.090 --> 00:37:47.969
You've got real talent
and you let yourself down by being silly.


562
00:37:48.095 --> 00:37:50.930
There's only so many conversations
I can have with you.


563
00:37:51.057 --> 00:37:53.892
Only so many times I can tell you off,
do you understand?


564
00:37:54.018 --> 00:37:56.394
You don't want to be told off by me.
It's boring.


565
00:37:56.520 --> 00:38:00.899
I hate doing it.
It's really boring for me as well.


566
00:38:01.025 --> 00:38:04.736
But if you could show me more
of what you've just shown me there,


567
00:38:04.862 --> 00:38:06.988
you could be great in this show.

568
00:38:07.114 --> 00:38:10.617
- So, can I be Joseph, Mr Maddens?
- We don't know that yet.


569
00:38:12.953 --> 00:38:15.747
I'm thinking I can
see my boy band here.

570
00:38:15.873 --> 00:38:19.334
I'm thinking this is the boy band
but we've got to whittle it down.


571
00:38:19.460 --> 00:38:21.920
- What about TJ?
- No TJ.


572
00:38:22.046 --> 00:38:25.090
- Why?
- He would be a really cool Gabriel.


573
00:38:25.216 --> 00:38:27.300
- OK.
- He's in my Gabriel pile.


574
00:38:27.426 --> 00:38:30.804
How are we going to whittle this down?
We've got to lose two.


575
00:38:30.930 --> 00:38:34.766
- Good dancer. Zack is a great dancer.
- He should definitely be in it.


576
00:38:34.892 --> 00:38:37.894
- Matt.
- Spiky hair and a good dancer.


577
00:38:38.020 --> 00:38:41.773
Right, he's a good dancer
plus he's eye candy for the girls.


578
00:38:41.899 --> 00:38:45.318
I don't think we need to bother with that.
He's 11 years old.


579
00:38:45.444 --> 00:38:49.572
Have you seen the looks he gets in
the playground? All these girls are like...


580
00:38:49.698 --> 00:38:52.534
- Good. OK.
- He doesn't walk round the playground.


581
00:38:52.660 --> 00:38:56.037
He struts. Bobby!

582
00:38:56.163 --> 00:38:58.790
Good morning, Mr Poppy.

583
00:38:58.916 --> 00:39:02.210
I'm a bit upset because I haven't
got a part in the proper show.


584
00:39:02.336 --> 00:39:04.921
How do you know that?
We're just working it out now.


585
00:39:05.047 --> 00:39:07.799
- Bob, what do you want to be?
- I want to be a king.


586
00:39:07.925 --> 00:39:10.427
(♪ She's the brightest star
I've ever seen...


587
00:39:10.553 --> 00:39:12.011
Throw some shapes.

588
00:39:12.138 --> 00:39:16.057
(♪ It's like we're living
In some kind of dream


589
00:39:16.183 --> 00:39:19.894
(♪ Why do I feel overcome
With hope and joy?


590
00:39:20.020 --> 00:39:22.355
(♪ Cos she's shining down her light

591
00:39:22.481 --> 00:39:26.818
(♪ And she's gonna be my girl
And me her boy (♪


592
00:39:26.944 --> 00:39:28.903
Is there room for a little one?

593
00:39:29.029 --> 00:39:31.406
- Mm, yeah.
- You're through.


594
00:39:31.532 --> 00:39:33.867
Get in there, baby. Get in.

595
00:39:33.993 --> 00:39:36.870
Thank you, Bob. Chin up.

596
00:39:39.623 --> 00:39:43.418
Things are moving apace,
with this Hollywood business.


597
00:39:43.544 --> 00:39:46.045
If they go down the road
before they come here


598
00:39:46.172 --> 00:39:48.465
it's going to be the end of everything.

599
00:39:48.591 --> 00:39:51.593
We're going to be washed up
by the age of ten.


600
00:39:51.719 --> 00:39:55.430
We need to find Jennifer Lore,
who's this executive producer.


601
00:39:55.556 --> 00:39:57.599
She works in one of five major studios.

602
00:39:57.725 --> 00:40:01.603
I need somebody to go on line to find
out where she is. I want her contacted.


603
00:40:01.729 --> 00:40:05.482
We need to find out exactly what
St Bernadette's are doing in their show.


604
00:40:05.608 --> 00:40:07.066
Yes, Mr Shakespeare.

605
00:40:07.193 --> 00:40:11.946
We can see what their show is like,
and then we can just top it.


606
00:40:12.072 --> 00:40:15.116
We can just beat them. If their show's
big, we can make ours bigger.


607
00:40:24.168 --> 00:40:25.752
We're going to do a warm-up

608
00:40:25.878 --> 00:40:29.172
because it's important
before we do any strenuous activity


609
00:40:29.298 --> 00:40:31.799
that we warm our bodies
and our minds up.


610
00:40:31.926 --> 00:40:35.512
Minds are equally important
to warm up as our bodies.


611
00:40:35.638 --> 00:40:37.055
- Hi, Mr Poppy.
- Hi.


612
00:40:37.181 --> 00:40:40.391
What we're gonna do is a gentle
warm-up. You can join us, if you like.


613
00:40:40.518 --> 00:40:44.896
I've actually got some music. A little
dance. We're just going to limber up.


614
00:40:45.022 --> 00:40:47.815
Copy what I do. And you, Mr Maddens.

615
00:41:08.295 --> 00:41:12.799
(♪ Ooh, ooh, oh, ooh, oh

616
00:41:12.925 --> 00:41:15.176
(♪ Let me tell you now

617
00:41:15.302 --> 00:41:18.930
- (♪ Ooh, ooh
- (♪ Ooh, ooh


618
00:41:19.056 --> 00:41:24.143
(♪ When I had you to myself
I didn't want you around


619
00:41:24.270 --> 00:41:29.315
(♪ Those pretty faces always
Make you stand out in a crowd


620
00:41:29.441 --> 00:41:31.859
(♪ But someone picked you
From the bunch


621
00:41:31.986 --> 00:41:34.279
(♪ One glance was all it took

622
00:41:34.405 --> 00:41:38.449
(♪ Now it's much too late for me
To take a second look


623
00:41:39.368 --> 00:41:44.247
(♪ Oh, baby, give me one more chance

624
00:41:44.373 --> 00:41:49.294
(♪ Won't you please let me
Back in your heart?


625
00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:54.632
- (♪ Oh, darling, I was blind to let you go
- (♪ Let you go, baby


626
00:41:54.758 --> 00:41:59.304
- (♪ But now since I see you in his arms
- (♪ I want you back


627
00:41:59.430 --> 00:42:01.139
(♪ Oh, I do now...

628
00:42:01.265 --> 00:42:02.724
Spies!

629
00:42:04.268 --> 00:42:06.811
Mr Maddens, it's the freak.

630
00:42:08.522 --> 00:42:14.986
Cry God for Harry,
England and St George!


631
00:42:15.112 --> 00:42:17.405
Come on, let's go!

632
00:42:19.950 --> 00:42:22.702
Fall back!

633
00:42:27.791 --> 00:42:29.751
Ha-ha! Break time!

634
00:42:29.877 --> 00:42:34.672
I just wanted to say, if you needed any
help with any of the singing or dancing...


635
00:42:41.639 --> 00:42:44.724
- Step shuffle, change shuffle...
- Excuse me.


636
00:42:51.774 --> 00:42:53.941
Gordon!

637
00:42:54.068 --> 00:42:58.321
- Gordon! What are you doing?
- This is ridiculous!


638
00:42:58.447 --> 00:43:03.743
- Why have you come to the school?
- We came here on a field trip...


639
00:43:03.869 --> 00:43:06.162
Excuse me. I don't think... no.

640
00:43:06.288 --> 00:43:08.539
Mr Maddens!

641
00:43:12.002 --> 00:43:14.587
Bundle!

642
00:43:17.007 --> 00:43:21.052
Some of the children have described to
me being encouraged to have a rumble.


643
00:43:21.178 --> 00:43:24.430
- Now, what on earth does that mean?
- It was more of a bundle.


644
00:43:24.556 --> 00:43:27.100
Bundle or rumble, 
I do not care.

645
00:43:27.226 --> 00:43:31.187
You've dragged this school
and your trousers through the mire.


646
00:43:31.313 --> 00:43:33.231
If it wasn't
for this whole Hollywood thing,


647
00:43:33.357 --> 00:43:37.068
you'd be off these premises
without a job and without a reference.


648
00:43:37.194 --> 00:43:40.154
Get out, go on, back to your classrooms.
Tuck your shirt in.


649
00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:42.657
Sorry.

650
00:43:42.783 --> 00:43:45.076
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

651
00:43:45.202 --> 00:43:49.163
I know a lot of you have heard
all about the Hollywood connection


652
00:43:49.289 --> 00:43:51.916
so I'll hand you over
to Mr Maddens, Paul.


653
00:43:52.042 --> 00:43:54.877
There was talk about, er... relocating.

654
00:43:55.003 --> 00:43:59.298
- Is there any truth in this?
- There's a lot of talk about Hollywood.


655
00:43:59.425 --> 00:44:02.093
I don't want any of us
to run away with ourselves


656
00:44:02.219 --> 00:44:05.179
and start dreaming about Hollywood
mansions or swimming pools


657
00:44:05.305 --> 00:44:07.265
when that is plainly a fantasy.

658
00:44:07.391 --> 00:44:11.769
Yeah, but if the people from Hollywood
see something brilliant in your child,


659
00:44:11.895 --> 00:44:13.438
they'll maybe take them over there.

660
00:44:13.564 --> 00:44:16.607
I'm worried about the religious aspect
of this being lost.


661
00:44:16.734 --> 00:44:21.279
It's going to be absolutely 100 percent
in line with the teaching of the Church.


662
00:44:21.405 --> 00:44:24.949
- A normal nativity.
- But also we've got the death slide.


663
00:44:25.075 --> 00:44:26.909
How much are you paying?

664
00:44:27.035 --> 00:44:29.328
There will be no financial benefit.

665
00:44:29.455 --> 00:44:33.499
If you're making a film, there's got to be
a fee. Nobody does a film for nothing.


666
00:44:33.625 --> 00:44:38.004
- It's Hollywood. They've got the money.
- And he's good, he deserves to be paid.


667
00:44:38.130 --> 00:44:41.716
About a million pounds,
I think I've heard.


668
00:44:41.842 --> 00:44:43.843
We gonna have to get agents.

669
00:44:43.969 --> 00:44:46.971
- Alfie can't have contacts.
- Don't cast him, then.


670
00:44:47.097 --> 00:44:50.057
- My daughter is very beautiful.
- Will my daughter Becky be in?


671
00:44:50.184 --> 00:44:53.561
- It would be my daughter.
- I think she's a Mary, isn't she?


672
00:44:53.687 --> 00:44:57.148
OK, folks.

673
00:44:57.274 --> 00:44:59.776
Hi, Jennifer, this is Paul. Paul Maddens.

674
00:44:59.902 --> 00:45:03.738
Just wondering if you could
possibly give me a call back.


675
00:45:03.864 --> 00:45:06.491
I have something to ask you,
if that's all right.


676
00:45:06.617 --> 00:45:09.202
If you could give me a... Love you.

677
00:45:09.328 --> 00:45:10.745
What are you...?

678
00:45:10.871 --> 00:45:12.997
Don't say that!

679
00:45:13.123 --> 00:45:16.083
- Why did you tell me to say that?
- It's a nice ending.


680
00:45:16.210 --> 00:45:20.463
It's not, it's a totally inappropriate
ending. What are you talking about?


681
00:45:20.589 --> 00:45:23.841
- Why are you in my house?
- I'm just trying to help, Mr Maddens.


682
00:45:23.967 --> 00:45:28.763
Well, it's not helping! I haven't
told her I loved her for five years!


683
00:45:28.889 --> 00:45:31.057
Get out! What are you doing?

684
00:45:31.725 --> 00:45:35.186
I think he's doing it for the best because
if it does happen, it's gonna be brilliant.


685
00:45:35.312 --> 00:45:37.980
- It's not happening, is it?
- But it might happen.


686
00:45:38.106 --> 00:45:40.066
- How?
- Well...


687
00:45:40.192 --> 00:45:43.027
- How's it gonna happen?
- Maybe you could help out.


688
00:45:43.153 --> 00:45:45.112
Desmond? Desmond?

689
00:45:45.239 --> 00:45:48.366
You were going to be
on break duty today. Can you...?


690
00:45:48.492 --> 00:45:50.409
Yeah, I was just chatting
with Miss Rye.


691
00:45:50.536 --> 00:45:52.870
Yes, you shouldn't be.
Can you get out, please?


692
00:45:52.996 --> 00:45:55.331
- Paul?
- Yeah?


693
00:45:55.457 --> 00:45:57.542
Why did you lie?

694
00:45:58.418 --> 00:46:00.127
About what?

695
00:46:00.254 --> 00:46:03.923
About America, about Hollywood,
all being a complete load of rubbish.


696
00:46:04.049 --> 00:46:06.717
- You've lied about all this.
- You did lie.


697
00:46:06.844 --> 00:46:09.887
- I'm in shock. I'm in shock.
- I'm really sorry.


698
00:46:10.013 --> 00:46:12.306
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know.


699
00:46:12.432 --> 00:46:15.226
- You've got to do something.
- Maybe you've got a great idea!


700
00:46:15.352 --> 00:46:18.980
We've got to get Jennifer to somehow
return your calls or speak to you.


701
00:46:19.106 --> 00:46:20.356
Yes.

702
00:46:20.482 --> 00:46:25.194
We're gonna film what we've done
and film some of the rehearsals, OK?


703
00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:27.363
- The best bits.
- Of these children?


704
00:46:27.489 --> 00:46:30.199
- Yes!
- Four seconds! There are no best bits.


705
00:46:30.325 --> 00:46:32.243
- Oh!
- Come on, Paul.


706
00:46:32.369 --> 00:46:36.664
Just get something, get whatever you
can, the best thing you can on the DVD.


707
00:46:36.790 --> 00:46:39.375
Film it for the DVD, send the DVD.

708
00:46:39.501 --> 00:46:43.379
- Stop saying DVD.
- It's got to be worth a try.


709
00:46:43.505 --> 00:46:46.048
Well, I'm not doing the DVD.

Mrs Bevan and Mr Maddens.


732
00:48:56.430 --> 00:48:58.973
- Hello. Paul Maddens.
- Nice to meet you.


733
00:48:59.099 --> 00:49:01.684
- How do you do?
- Nice to see you again, Mrs Bevan.


734
00:49:01.810 --> 00:49:03.436
You look marvellous.

735
00:49:03.562 --> 00:49:06.272
This old thing,
it comes out at Christmas time.


736
00:49:06.398 --> 00:49:09.400
- You look like a Christmas cracker.
- Thank you very much.


737
00:49:09.526 --> 00:49:13.154
Let's hope you get pulled
before the end of the night.


738
00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:16.032
- Can I take you for a drink, Mrs Bevan?
- Mm.


739
00:49:16.158 --> 00:49:18.659
- You'd like a glass of champagne.
- I'd love another one.


740
00:49:18.785 --> 00:49:20.619
It's very nice, very cooling.

741
00:49:20.746 --> 00:49:22.621
- Patrick Burns.
- Hello.


742
00:49:22.748 --> 00:49:26.042
- Coventry Evening Telegraph.
- I know who you are, yeah.


743
00:49:26.168 --> 00:49:29.587
- Excited?
- About?


744
00:49:29.713 --> 00:49:32.757
- Hollywood?
- Oh, yeah, that old thing. No.


745
00:49:32.883 --> 00:49:36.218
I've got contacts there,
had them for years. Pulling in a favour.


746
00:49:36.344 --> 00:49:39.597
Yeah, yeah, from a young lady.
Jennifer, isn't it? Jennifer?


747
00:49:39.723 --> 00:49:44.602
Yeah. You know, sorry, I know how this
works. No, this is like you're a reporter.


748
00:49:44.728 --> 00:49:47.480
No, no, I'm off duty. I'm off duty.

749
00:49:47.606 --> 00:49:50.524
- I hear there's no such thing.
- Oh, please.


750
00:49:50.650 --> 00:49:54.278
Gordon was just saying how you had
a few problems in the beginning


751
00:49:54.404 --> 00:49:58.240
and then he said to her,
"You go, girl, you go to LA."


752
00:49:58.366 --> 00:50:02.369
- Really?
- I just wondered your take on it all.


753
00:50:04.581 --> 00:50:07.291
I'm sensing a lot of anger.

754
00:50:07.417 --> 00:50:09.460
Are you? Why would that be, I wonder?

755
00:50:09.586 --> 00:50:13.672
Could it be because you are the man
who, five years ago, roundly trashed


756
00:50:13.799 --> 00:50:17.468
my one honest attempt
at putting on a nativity?


757
00:50:17.594 --> 00:50:19.178
Are you sure it was me?

758
00:50:19.304 --> 00:50:21.430
"Jesus, Mary and Joseph!"
was the headline.


759
00:50:21.556 --> 00:50:25.059
- And now, when there's a chance...
- Oh, come on, it was appalling.


760
00:50:25.185 --> 00:50:29.730
- So you do remember it?
- I did that review to make you tough.


761
00:50:29.856 --> 00:50:32.566
Look at you now,
you're mixing with Hollywood.


762
00:50:32.692 --> 00:50:35.611
You're no one if you haven't had
a bad review off Patrick Burns.


763
00:50:35.737 --> 00:50:39.406
That's why they call them
Burns victims.


764
00:50:39.533 --> 00:50:41.742
Ladies and gentlemen!

765
00:50:41.868 --> 00:50:45.037
Can I thank you for your attendance
and your support


766
00:50:45.163 --> 00:50:49.458
because I would like to congratulate
Mr Maddens and St Bernadette's School


767
00:50:49.584 --> 00:50:53.754
for the incredible opportunity that
they are affording our wonderful city.


768
00:50:53.880 --> 00:50:56.215
Mr Maddens.

769
00:50:56.341 --> 00:51:01.512
Now, in honour of this occasion,
and much against the council's wishes,


770
00:51:01.638 --> 00:51:04.098
the mayor's parlour
has overruled the council


771
00:51:04.224 --> 00:51:08.519
and we would like to offer the cathedral
ruins as a venue for your show.


772
00:51:08.645 --> 00:51:11.647
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

773
00:51:23.285 --> 00:51:28.539
Mr Maddens. This is brilliant.
This is gonna blow your mind.


774
00:51:28.665 --> 00:51:30.958
Prepare to be amazed.

775
00:51:31.084 --> 00:51:33.460
We're doing it at the cathedral.

776
00:51:34.212 --> 00:51:35.671
What?

777
00:51:35.797 --> 00:51:40.885
We're doing the show
in the ruins of the cathedral.


778
00:51:41.011 --> 00:51:43.512
- Yes! The cathedral's got a spire.
- It's got a spire.


779
00:51:43.638 --> 00:51:46.599
You don't seem to understand

780
00:51:46.725 --> 00:51:49.602
that the bigger this gets,
it's now constituting fraud.


781
00:51:49.728 --> 00:51:54.481
He's getting corporate sponsors to give
money and give their services for free.


782
00:51:54.608 --> 00:51:58.569
We need money. We need lights.
We need a little smoke machine.


783
00:51:58.695 --> 00:52:02.573
We need someone to help us
do the hanging, because I can't.


784
00:52:02.699 --> 00:52:06.118
- I think I need someone...
- Mr Poppy, stop it, please. Seriously.


785
00:52:06.244 --> 00:52:09.663
- What are you doing?
- I think I'm having a heart attack.


786
00:52:09.789 --> 00:52:11.624
- Mr Maddens?
- Don't touch me.


787
00:52:11.750 --> 00:52:15.336
- Mr Maddens, you're upset, aren't you?
- Oh!


788
00:52:15.462 --> 00:52:18.797
I can give you a cuddle?
Cuddles make it all go away.


789
00:52:18.924 --> 00:52:20.925
I promise. Feel this.

790
00:52:21.968 --> 00:52:24.803
You're hurting me.

791
00:52:24.930 --> 00:52:28.182
We can do this, Mr Maddens, can't we?
Yes, we can.


792
00:52:28.308 --> 00:52:31.227
- No, we can't.
- We can. We can.


793
00:52:31.353 --> 00:52:35.814
Look, I'll leave you here, all right?
You can listen to the music.


794
00:52:35.941 --> 00:52:38.525
Relax, I'll take care of the children.

795
00:52:41.363 --> 00:52:43.614
Believe, Mr Maddens. Believe.

No, everyone's gonna laugh with you.

Anyone who tells you that anyone's
gonna laugh at you must be a fool,

I need all of you in it, OK?

- Whoa, whoa, whoa!


878
00:58:30.962 --> 00:58:33.922
- Room for two little ones?
- Sorry?


879
00:58:34.048 --> 00:58:36.967
- William and Saffron are coming.
- They can't.


880
00:58:37.093 --> 00:58:41.305
I've got the consent forms from the
parents. Passports. I've got the tickets.


881
00:58:41.431 --> 00:58:45.058
Miss Rye and I thought it'd be
a really good idea if they come with you,


882
00:58:45.184 --> 00:58:48.562
because they can do the singing,
dance and do the opening numbers.


883
00:58:48.688 --> 00:58:51.565
The gate's closing.
What are your allergies?


884
00:58:51.691 --> 00:58:54.484
Ponies, horses, donkeys and cats.

885
00:58:54.611 --> 00:58:58.739
- You'd better take these back.
- It's a good idea. It's a good idea.


886
00:58:58.865 --> 00:59:00.657
- Desmond.
- They can help you.


887
00:59:00.783 --> 00:59:03.368
I'm not taking two children
on an eleven-hour flight.


888
00:59:12.920 --> 00:59:16.840
(♪ Just hear those sleigh bells jingling
Ring-ting-tingling too


889
00:59:16.966 --> 00:59:19.176
(♪ Ding-a-ling-a-ling-a-ding-dong

890
00:59:19.302 --> 00:59:23.722
(♪ Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you


891
00:59:23.848 --> 00:59:27.601
(♪ Outside the snow is falling
And friends are calling, "Yoo-hoo!"


892
00:59:27.727 --> 00:59:30.228
(♪ Ting-a-ling-a-ling-a-ding-dong (♪

893
00:59:30.355 --> 00:59:33.190
- Mr Maddens, look what we've found!
- What is it?


894
00:59:33.316 --> 00:59:38.236
So, we're in the right area. We're closer
to her than we were at the beach. Good.


895
00:59:38.363 --> 00:59:42.324
We should be getting
very near Beverly Hills now.


896
00:59:42.450 --> 00:59:44.534
Saffron!

897
00:59:46.454 --> 00:59:50.207
If we come across anyone, let me do
the talking and you keep schtum, OK?


898
00:59:50.333 --> 00:59:52.000
Now just follow me.

899
00:59:52.126 --> 00:59:54.461
Excuse me.
Do you guys have an appointment?


900
00:59:54.587 --> 00:59:59.091
I have an appointment with Jennifer
Lore. My name is Paul Maddens.


901
00:59:59.217 --> 01:00:03.261
- Can I see some ID, please?
- Sorry?


902
01:00:03.388 --> 01:00:06.348
- I need to see a piece of ID.
- I'm so sorry.


903
01:00:06.474 --> 01:00:09.685
I haven't got it with me.
I was going to meet her for lunch.


904
01:00:09.811 --> 01:00:13.271
You're not on the list. So I wouldn't be
able to let you on, even if you had it.


905
01:00:13.398 --> 01:00:17.067
Is it possible to check? I'm here.
I've come all the way with them..


906
01:00:17.193 --> 01:00:22.030
I just updated this, but I'll check one
more time for you. So, you stay here.


907
01:00:23.199 --> 01:00:27.077
- Follow me! Come on, this way!
- Hey, stop! Come here! Stop!


908
01:00:27.203 --> 01:00:29.246
Come here! Stop!

909
01:00:29.372 --> 01:00:31.707
Quick!

910
01:00:31.833 --> 01:00:33.792
Come on!

911
01:00:36.921 --> 01:00:38.797
OK, come here, come here.

912
01:00:38.923 --> 01:00:42.467
- Hold on tight.
- Hey, stop!


913
01:00:45.304 --> 01:00:48.932
Stop, wait! Respect the badge! Stop!

914
01:00:49.058 --> 01:00:52.894
- Help! I can't slow down!
- Whoa! Whoa!


915
01:00:53.020 --> 01:00:56.189
Think Gabriel!
Father Thomas, it's not your bit.


916
01:00:56.315 --> 01:00:59.151
What do you mean, it's not my bit?

917
01:01:27.472 --> 01:01:28.638
Oh!

918
01:01:34.187 --> 01:01:36.772
Good morning,
Independent United Pictures.


919
01:01:36.898 --> 01:01:40.776
That's a David Lowestein?
OK, putting you through.


920
01:01:40.902 --> 01:01:44.571
Good morning,
Independent United Pictures. Hi, Angie.


921
01:01:44.697 --> 01:01:46.573
I know.

922
01:01:46.699 --> 01:01:50.660
Putting you through.
How can I help you, sir?


923
01:01:50.787 --> 01:01:54.581
- Hi. My name is Paul Maddens.
- Independent United Pictures. Uh-huh.


924
01:01:54.707 --> 01:01:59.211
That's for a Shaun Michell?
OK, putting you through. I'm sorry, sir.


925
01:01:59.337 --> 01:02:02.130
Paul Maddens to see
Jennifer Lore at 10:00.


926
01:02:02.256 --> 01:02:07.260
- Can I take your name again, sir?
- Paul Maddens. M-A-D-D-E-N-S.


927
01:02:07.386 --> 01:02:10.096
- And that's a P-A-U-L-L?
- P-A-U-L.


928
01:02:10.223 --> 01:02:14.392
- No, just one L.
- L. I don't have that appointment, sir.


929
01:02:14.519 --> 01:02:18.438
- Sir, move away from the desk.
- I've moved away.


930
01:02:18.564 --> 01:02:20.565
Tony, we have children in reception!

931
01:02:20.691 --> 01:02:23.401
- So what's the problem there?
- Tony!


932
01:02:23.528 --> 01:02:27.239
- Calm down.
- I'm so sorry, there's this crazy guy...


933
01:02:27.365 --> 01:02:31.034
- And he's been...
- Yeah, no, it's fine. It's OK. It's fine.


934
01:02:36.707 --> 01:02:38.959
You look amazing.

935
01:02:39.085 --> 01:02:41.753
- Why are you here?
- You know why I'm here.


936
01:02:41.879 --> 01:02:45.215
You didn't give me much of a choice.
You wouldn't return my calls.


937
01:02:45.341 --> 01:02:47.717
Paul, I don't understand
what I'm meant to do.


938
01:02:47.844 --> 01:02:50.762
Look, you shouldn't be involved in it

939
01:02:50.888 --> 01:02:53.306
but somehow we've got to a situation

940
01:02:53.432 --> 01:02:56.226
where the whole town thinks
that Hollywood are coming.


941
01:02:56.352 --> 01:02:58.770
Why do I feel
like I'm suddenly ten years ago?


942
01:02:58.896 --> 01:03:01.898
I tried to maintain a contact with you.

943
01:03:02.024 --> 01:03:05.443
- You did not want anything to...
- Excuse me. Sorry. Jen.


944
01:03:05.570 --> 01:03:07.821
- This is that letter of agreement.
- OK.


945
01:03:07.947 --> 01:03:11.783
- You can take time off and come and...
- I can't take time off.


946
01:03:11.909 --> 01:03:17.163
Hang on. All of a sudden, an executive
producer can't just take their time off?


947
01:03:17.290 --> 01:03:21.251
- I'm not an executive producer.
- What are you, then?


948
01:03:21.377 --> 01:03:25.046
I... I file, I answer phone calls,
I speak to people.


949
01:03:25.172 --> 01:03:27.132
I put people in meetings,
out of meetings.


950
01:03:27.258 --> 01:03:29.134
- A secretary?
- Yeah.


951
01:03:29.260 --> 01:03:32.220
You can't be a secretary.
You can't be a secretary.


952
01:03:32.346 --> 01:03:35.265
She does a lot more than that,
and you should respect her...


953
01:03:35.391 --> 01:03:39.769
Yes, I am. I am pretty much a secretary.
Yeah, yeah.


954
01:03:41.063 --> 01:03:43.398
I'm sorry, look I know this is mad.

955
01:03:43.524 --> 01:03:46.943
I know this is insane
and it's my fault.


956
01:03:47.069 --> 01:03:50.780
I'm asking you for one more favour
and then I'll be out of your life.


957
01:03:50.907 --> 01:03:52.782
I can't do anything, 
I have no power.

958
01:03:52.909 --> 01:03:55.785
If you can't do it, who can?
Harrison, are you up for it?


959
01:03:55.912 --> 01:03:59.039
- No, I'm sorry you came all this way.
- Trip to England?


960
01:03:59.165 --> 01:04:02.792
Paul, listen, I'm really sorry
that you've come over here.


961
01:04:02.919 --> 01:04:05.295
- Is there a Harvey or Bob?
- There's not.


962
01:04:05.421 --> 01:04:07.839
- Who could help me out?
- Have you got an appointment?


963
01:04:07.965 --> 01:04:12.969
No, but I'm not leaving here with these
two without something to take home.


964
01:04:13.095 --> 01:04:15.805
Come here!

965
01:04:15.932 --> 01:04:18.892
- Kevin, get Security.
- Security, please.


966
01:04:19.018 --> 01:04:21.978
Come on. Here it
is. This way. This way.

967
01:04:22.104 --> 01:04:25.231
Have you heard of the nativity?

968
01:04:25.358 --> 01:04:28.234
You have. I can tell you have.

969
01:04:28.361 --> 01:04:30.528
Right, so we're doing our nativity show.

970
01:04:30.655 --> 01:04:33.448
- Mary meets Joseph, they give birth...
- I know the story.


971
01:04:33.574 --> 01:04:37.619
OK, you know the story, then,
but it's being performed by 24 children...


972
01:04:37.745 --> 01:04:43.291
It happens every year in every school
around the world where Christians are.


973
01:04:43.417 --> 01:04:45.669
So, what's so special about yours?

974
01:04:45.795 --> 01:04:48.713
A good question.
Here's an even better answer.


975
01:04:48.839 --> 01:04:51.049
One, two, three, four.

976
01:04:51.175 --> 01:04:56.846
- (♪ Things are really cool in Nazareth...
- Sing it out.


977
01:04:56.973 --> 01:05:01.017
(♪ Our city is full of joy

978
01:05:01.143 --> 01:05:05.063
(♪ Cos this is where girl meets boy...

979
01:05:05.189 --> 01:05:08.650
Yes, that's a Shaun Burridge,
putting you through.


980
01:05:08.776 --> 01:05:10.902
Last chance.

981
01:05:13.197 --> 01:05:17.367
- Bye, Paul. Thanks for dropping by.
- Oh, shut up, Harrison.


982
01:05:25.668 --> 01:05:28.503
They're not coming, are they?

983
01:05:30.172 --> 01:05:31.756
No, they're not.

984
01:05:31.882 --> 01:05:35.510
- Is it our fault?
- Hey, what? No.


985
01:05:35.636 --> 01:05:39.055
No, it's not your fault. Come on.

986
01:05:40.641 --> 01:05:44.102
Although you could
have sung a bit better.


987
01:05:48.566 --> 01:05:53.445
They're expecting Hollywood
to come and see their show.


988
01:05:54.530 --> 01:05:57.032
Mr Parker, we can make that happen.

989
01:05:57.158 --> 01:05:59.826
I got 50 states.

990
01:05:59.952 --> 01:06:04.289
I've got hundreds of towns
in each one of those states


991
01:06:04.415 --> 01:06:07.208
that are putting on a nativity play.

992
01:06:07.334 --> 01:06:09.919
I don't need to travel 6,000 miles.

993
01:06:10.046 --> 01:06:13.590
Mr Parker, I need you
to do this for me.

994
01:06:14.550 --> 01:06:17.510
I have worked here
for three years and...


995
01:06:17.636 --> 01:06:23.516
every morning at ten to eight
I take your coat, I hang it up.


996
01:06:23.642 --> 01:06:27.687
At nine o'clock I get you your coffee,
I put it on your table.


997
01:06:27.813 --> 01:06:31.066
I take away the letters,
I put them into the out box,


998
01:06:31.192 --> 01:06:35.862
I take the other letters and put them
into the in box. I file, I fax, I smile.


999
01:06:35.988 --> 01:06:39.032
Jennifer,

1000
01:06:39.158 --> 01:06:41.284
that's what you're paid to do.

1001
01:06:42.787 --> 01:06:44.871
I know.

1002
01:06:45.956 --> 01:06:47.999
- Yes.
- Yes.


1003
01:06:53.422 --> 01:06:56.633
- Hello.
- Well?


1004
01:06:58.511 --> 01:07:00.512
No joy.

1005
01:07:04.100 --> 01:07:07.644
To take two children
out of here without my permission!


1006
01:07:07.770 --> 01:07:11.731
- Mrs Bevan, I have consent.
- Thank goodness for that!


1007
01:07:11.857 --> 01:07:13.983
It was the first
thing Mr Poppy gave me.

1008
01:07:14.110 --> 01:07:18.238
Otherwise it would be abduction and
the whole school would have to close.


1009
01:07:18.364 --> 01:07:20.824
I would never have got on the plane
had I not had these.


1010
01:07:20.950 --> 01:07:25.620
Do you realise the school could get
into severe trouble over this?


1011
01:07:29.208 --> 01:07:33.378
- What is this?
- I don't know what that is.


1012
01:07:33.504 --> 01:07:35.964
What is that? Did you do that?

1013
01:07:38.634 --> 01:07:41.928
Desmond, I trusted you.
I trusted you with children.


1014
01:07:42.054 --> 01:07:45.348
Small lives.
I thought you could rise to the challenge.


1015
01:07:45.474 --> 01:07:48.518
- But you have been a disaster.
- I'm really sorry, Auntie Pat.


1016
01:07:48.644 --> 01:07:53.022
- Did you know about this?
- Not that. But I did know about...


1017
01:07:53.149 --> 01:07:55.567
- No.
- What did you know?


1018
01:07:55.693 --> 01:07:59.320
- We've got to tell her.
- Speak to me. What did you know?


1019
01:07:59.446 --> 01:08:03.366
Well, actually, Hollywood,
they're not coming.


1020
01:08:03.492 --> 01:08:07.328
Paul, Mr Maddens panicked, I think,

1021
01:08:07.454 --> 01:08:10.582
and, er... lied.

1022
01:08:10.708 --> 01:08:14.544
Why did I ever, ever for a minute
think that this school


1023
01:08:14.670 --> 01:08:17.422
would ever have
anything good happen to it,


1024
01:08:17.548 --> 01:08:19.966
and out of the ordinary
and successful and...


1025
01:08:20.092 --> 01:08:23.678
and helpful to me and the children?

1026
01:08:23.804 --> 01:08:26.598
Why did I ever think that would happen?
Of course it wouldn't.


1027
01:08:26.724 --> 01:08:29.392
- Mrs Bevan.
- Start looking for another job.


1028
01:08:29.518 --> 01:08:32.228
- Sorry?
- And you, you're out.


1029
01:08:35.816 --> 01:08:38.776
You're irresponsible, you're not focused.

1030
01:08:38.903 --> 01:08:41.863
You're, I think, possibly
educationally subnormal.


1031
01:08:41.989 --> 01:08:45.742
You have an attitude of wanting
to be a friend to the children


1032
01:08:45.868 --> 01:08:48.244
rather than a professional adult.

1033
01:08:48.370 --> 01:08:52.790
Which anybody can do. Any fool
can say, "Who wants to meet a pig?


1034
01:08:52.917 --> 01:08:56.377
"Hands up, who wants to go
to a hospital. " Any fool can do that.


1035
01:08:56.503 --> 01:09:01.382
And it transpires that you are that any
fool, and I really had high hopes for you.


1036
01:09:01.508 --> 01:09:04.219
For five minutes
I thought you were something else,


1037
01:09:04.345 --> 01:09:07.639
but, no, it transpires
you are actually just an idiot.


1038
01:09:13.437 --> 01:09:16.105
As you know, I've been away
for a couple of days


1039
01:09:16.232 --> 01:09:22.237
and in that time something
has changed regarding our nativity.


1040
01:09:22.363 --> 01:09:25.531
I'm afraid I let you believe
that Hollywood were coming


1041
01:09:25.658 --> 01:09:27.033
and they're not coming.

1042
01:09:27.159 --> 01:09:29.118
But worse than that,

1043
01:09:29.245 --> 01:09:34.332
we are not actually being allowed to do
the show, there will be no nativity at all.


1044
01:09:34.458 --> 01:09:38.711
Can't we do the show anyway?
We don't care about Hollywood.


1045
01:09:38.837 --> 01:09:42.632
Unfortunately not. Mrs Bevan
is not gonna let us do the show.


1046
01:09:42.758 --> 01:09:48.137
Please, please, please, Mr Maddens.
Can we still do the nativity? Please?


1047
01:09:48.264 --> 01:09:50.056
I told a lie,

1048
01:09:50.182 --> 01:09:55.687
and I let that lie grow and multiply
and turn into lots of other little lies,


1049
01:09:55.813 --> 01:09:59.190
and, as I've told you all, probably,
on many different occasions,


1050
01:09:59.316 --> 01:10:04.862
a lie always, always causes
more problems than it solves.


1051
01:10:04.989 --> 01:10:09.826
Which is why I
shan't be here next term.

1052
01:10:09.952 --> 01:10:13.621
This will be my last term here.
I won't be coming back.


1053
01:10:13.747 --> 01:10:17.917
And worse than losing my job,
my position, my security,


1054
01:10:18.043 --> 01:10:22.213
much worse than that is that
I'm not gonna see any of you again.


1055
01:10:22.339 --> 01:10:24.924
And...

1056
01:10:26.677 --> 01:10:29.178
...that's a very hurtful thing for me.

1057
01:10:30.431 --> 01:10:33.516
Come on, back to your class, please.

1058
01:10:33.642 --> 01:10:40.940
(♪ Have yourself a merry little Christmas

1059
01:10:42.693 --> 01:10:47.447

1061
01:11:02.004 --> 01:11:04.464
- There's a wee joke in it.
- Is there?


1062
01:11:04.590 --> 01:11:06.549
Oh!

1063
01:11:08.719 --> 01:11:12.221
- Just that little bit there.
- That's good.


1064
01:11:12.348 --> 01:11:15.475
- Hey.
- Jennifer, how are you?


1065
01:11:15.601 --> 01:11:18.102
- I'm all right.
- Good to see you.


1066
01:11:24.943 --> 01:11:28.905
(♪ Until then
We'll have to muddle through...


1067
01:11:29.031 --> 01:11:31.491

01:11:48.509 --> 01:11:52.011
Who are you
and where do you come from?


1072
01:11:52.137 --> 01:11:58.768
We are the three kings
and we've come to find the baby Jesus.


1073
01:11:58.894 --> 01:12:01.312
He's the new King of the Jews.

1074
01:12:01.438 --> 01:12:03.981
Kill every boy child in this land!

1075
01:12:04.108 --> 01:12:11.322
- Where's my baby? Where's my baby?
- Where's my baby? Where's my baby?


1076
01:12:34.304 --> 01:12:36.264
I am the King!

01:12:40.644 --> 01:12:44.856
(♪ So have yourself

01:12:44.982 --> 01:12:51.529
(♪ A merry little Christmas

01:12:51.655 --> 01:12:53.614
(♪ Now... (♪

1080
01:12:53.740 --> 01:12:59.829
Nouns are used to name a person,
animal, place, thing or idea.


1081
01:12:59.955 --> 01:13:03.207
We've got football,
pineapple, iguana, guitar.


1082
01:13:03.333 --> 01:13:08.504
Nouns can be replaced
by these pronouns.


1083
01:13:08.630 --> 01:13:10.882
They can replace nouns
or other pronouns.


1084
01:13:11.008 --> 01:13:16.179
So, ours, she, one, he, it,
this, these, you, none.


1085
01:13:16.305 --> 01:13:19.056
- Are you all right, Cleo?
- No, not very.


1086
01:13:19.183 --> 01:13:22.059
- What's the problem?
- Nothing.


1087
01:13:23.020 --> 01:13:26.355
- TJ?
- I miss Mr Poppy.


1088
01:13:26.482 --> 01:13:28.691
Everyone misses Mr Poppy.

1089
01:13:28.817 --> 01:13:31.903
We'd be doing the play
if Mr Poppy was still here.


1090
01:13:49.963 --> 01:13:56.677
Poppy! Poppy!

1091
01:13:57.763 --> 01:14:03.309
What am I doing? Meet me in the hall
in ten minutes. We're doing the play.


1092
01:14:16.532 --> 01:14:19.158
All right?

1093
01:14:20.953 --> 01:14:23.621
Desmond, I've come to apologise.

1094
01:14:23.747 --> 01:14:26.666
I said some things to you
that were unforgivable,


1095
01:14:26.792 --> 01:14:29.502
and that weren't true
and that were mean,


1096
01:14:29.628 --> 01:14:33.589
and I want you to come and do the play
with me because I've told the children


1097
01:14:33.715 --> 01:14:36.342
and I can't do it without you.

1098
01:14:37.636 --> 01:14:40.221
I messed everything up.

1099
01:14:40.347 --> 01:14:42.974
I know I put it
on you, I know I did.

1100
01:14:43.100 --> 01:14:45.142
You were right all along,

1101
01:14:45.269 --> 01:14:49.063
and for a dundus, you've been right on
the money every single step of the way.


1102
01:14:49.189 --> 01:14:52.149
You said I was scared, I denied it.
You were absolutely right.


1103
01:14:52.276 --> 01:14:56.904
You said I was still in love with Jennifer,
I denied it and you were absolutely right.


1104
01:15:04.788 --> 01:15:08.833
Well, let's do it. What are you waiting
for? We better get going, all right?


1105
01:15:08.959 --> 01:15:11.502
- You're going to do it?
- Yeah, let's do it.


1106
01:15:11.628 --> 01:15:14.088
Right, thank you.
You're not gonna regret it.


1107
01:15:22.055 --> 01:15:24.724
Oh, my gosh!

1108
01:15:24.850 --> 01:15:27.018
It looks amazing.

1109
01:15:27.144 --> 01:15:29.645
You remember
where to press the button.


1110
01:15:29.771 --> 01:15:33.524
- Don't be nervous, you're a Nazarean.
- Mr Maddens?


1111
01:15:33.650 --> 01:15:37.278
I don't want to be a building.
I want to get a proper part.


1112
01:15:37.404 --> 01:15:39.947
You're playing part of Nazareth
in a song called Nazareth.


1113
01:15:40.073 --> 01:15:41.991
Now, please, everyone calm down!

1114
01:15:42.117 --> 01:15:43.909
Fingers crossed, my friend.

1115
01:15:44.036 --> 01:15:48.247
- I'm nervous. I don't want to do it.
- I'm nervous, and I don't want to do it.


1116
01:15:48.373 --> 01:15:50.916
But it's you and me.
We're gonna beat them all.


1117
01:15:54.963 --> 01:15:59.175
Come on, Mr Maddens. We've got to
get going. We haven't got much time.


1118
01:15:59.301 --> 01:16:02.261
This is what everybody in Nazareth
used to wear, even the women.


1119
01:16:02.387 --> 01:16:04.305
Not on the women, no.

1120
01:16:07.643 --> 01:16:10.394
Buddy, Buddy,
it's exciting, isn't it?


1121
01:16:10.520 --> 01:16:12.772
Look, the audience are filling up.

1122
01:16:12.898 --> 01:16:16.233
OK, everybody listen up, all right?

1123
01:16:16.360 --> 01:16:18.819
Big bit of advice
and I had to learn this the hard way.


1124
01:16:18.945 --> 01:16:21.906
Can everybody make sure
you've done a poo and a wee,


1125
01:16:22.032 --> 01:16:24.659
because there won't be a chance
when we get the show going,


1126
01:16:24.785 --> 01:16:27.203
So, you can use my caravan,
do a poo and wee.


1127
01:16:27.329 --> 01:16:30.748
Come back! Come back!
There will be no show this evening.


1128
01:16:30.874 --> 01:16:34.794
Now, I have just had a phone call
telling me that this was all happening.


1129
01:16:34.920 --> 01:16:36.879
- What is all this?
- Mrs Bevan.


1130
01:16:37.005 --> 01:16:41.050
I cancelled this performance!
I cancelled the show! You are sacked!


1131
01:16:41.176 --> 01:16:44.303
- You know you are sacked.
- What else can you do to me?


1132
01:16:44.429 --> 01:16:48.057
- Desmond! Desmond!
- Thank you! This is marvellous!


1133
01:16:48.183 --> 01:16:50.726
- Well done, young man. Look at them!
- Thank you.


1134
01:16:50.852 --> 01:16:53.729
Don't they look wonderful?
Break a leg, kids!


1135
01:16:53.855 --> 01:16:56.482
- I need to have the microphone.
- OK, I'm gonna do it.


1136
01:16:56.608 --> 01:16:59.652
- Can you watch from that wing, please?
- Come on, love.


1137
01:16:59.778 --> 01:17:05.116
This is gonna be sensational.
The town will be so proud of you.


1138
01:17:09.246 --> 01:17:11.622
Ladies and gentlemen, mums and dads,

1139
01:17:11.748 --> 01:17:16.210
I just want to thank you for
all the effort you've put into the show.


1140
01:17:16.336 --> 01:17:20.464
But if I had to single any one person out
for their efforts,


1141
01:17:20.590 --> 01:17:24.343
for their time, their diligence
and their enthusiasm,


1142
01:17:24.469 --> 01:17:29.640
it would have to be Mrs B,
better known to you as Mrs Bevan.


1143
01:17:29.766 --> 01:17:32.143
Come on, come and take a bow.

1144
01:17:32.269 --> 01:17:35.312
Mrs Bevan. Come on. Come on.

1145
01:17:40.777 --> 01:17:45.448
Um... hello. Thank you very much, ladies
and gentlemen, it's very kind of you.


1146
01:17:45.574 --> 01:17:50.119
Er... this will be my last nativity play,
so it's a bit special, really.


1147
01:17:50.245 --> 01:17:51.662
We're used to the school hall,

1148
01:17:51.788 --> 01:17:57.334
we don't have all this beauty around us
normally for the play.


1149
01:17:57.461 --> 01:18:01.046
The mums and dads who've been
to see our nativity play know that, er...


1150
01:18:01.173 --> 01:18:05.009
you know, things can go
a little bit wrong with the little ones.


1151
01:18:05.135 --> 01:18:08.053
Don't expect... I was going to say,
don't expect too much.


1152
01:18:08.180 --> 01:18:11.390
But, er... I shouldn't have said that.

1153
01:18:11.516 --> 01:18:13.350
Smack.

1154
01:18:13.477 --> 01:18:18.147
Nobody ever expects enough
of the children at St Bernadette's.


1155
01:18:18.273 --> 01:18:22.485
Everyone expects them
to go down the drain,


1156
01:18:22.611 --> 01:18:25.112
and I'm going to change that.

1157
01:18:26.823 --> 01:18:29.283
That's what I said

1158
01:18:29.409 --> 01:18:31.827
tonight it stands
a chance of coming true.


1159
01:18:31.953 --> 01:18:36.123
I've not seen it.
I don't know what's gonna happen.


1160
01:18:36.249 --> 01:18:41.837
But all I know is that each and every
one of these children is amazing


1161
01:18:41.963 --> 01:18:46.217
and wonderful
and a little pocket of stardust.


1162
01:18:46.343 --> 01:18:48.260

nestle down to pop out the baby Jesus.


1331
01:32:29.540 --> 01:32:34.085
