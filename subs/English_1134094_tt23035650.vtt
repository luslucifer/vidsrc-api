00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:10.995
[delicate chime music]

2
00:00:11.128 --> 00:00:13.496
[wheezing]

3
00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:17.701
Do you make him leap
like the locust?


4
00:00:46.063 --> 00:00:47.899
[Stan] So, is Gano
still trying to buy you out?


5
00:00:48.032 --> 00:00:51.434
[Joba] Oh, sure, yeah, he's now
working on simulated worlds.


6
00:00:51.568 --> 00:00:53.436
It's like
nobody can handle real life.


7
00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.106
[Quincy] Speaking of which...

8
00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:56.974
Oh, yeah, Stan,
did Caleb happen to tell you


9
00:00:57.108 --> 00:00:58.675
where he went
for the past three months?


10
00:00:58.808 --> 00:01:00.978
[Stan sighs]
He tells me nothing.


11
00:01:01.112 --> 00:01:04.115
Oh, secrets. Bad Caleb.

12
00:01:04.248 --> 00:01:07.318
-[chuckles]
-All he said is it was amazing.


13
00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:08.785
Life changing.

14
00:01:09.419 --> 00:01:11.389
-And?
-And...


15
00:01:11.521 --> 00:01:15.293
you two are both
very, very good people.


16
00:01:15.425 --> 00:01:17.328
Wow. Caleb said we're good.

17
00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.528
I know.

18
00:01:18.662 --> 00:01:20.231
He's clearly up to something.

19
00:01:21.065 --> 00:01:23.566
And they're hilariously
funny as well.


20
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:24.768
They are funny.

21
00:01:24.902 --> 00:01:26.703
And good. Remember? Your words.

22
00:01:26.836 --> 00:01:28.772
Quincy, did you grow up
with these two?


23
00:01:28.906 --> 00:01:31.008
No. I met Joba in college.

24
00:01:31.142 --> 00:01:32.109
At Yale.

25
00:01:32.243 --> 00:01:33.344
Wow!

26
00:01:33.476 --> 00:01:34.811
Yale, Stan.

27
00:01:34.946 --> 00:01:36.414
-[chuckling]
-Yale.


28
00:01:36.546 --> 00:01:38.448
-Yale.
-Thank you.


29
00:01:38.581 --> 00:01:39.984
Yale. Yale.

30
00:01:40.117 --> 00:01:41.185
Where did you go, Stan?

31
00:01:42.019 --> 00:01:43.187
Binghamton.

32
00:01:43.321 --> 00:01:45.323
It's the Ivy of the SUNY system.

33
00:01:45.455 --> 00:01:47.158
-[Quincy] Hmm.
-There is no Ivy


34
00:01:47.291 --> 00:01:48.625
of the SUNY system.

35
00:01:48.758 --> 00:01:50.827
And that is what makes it
the SUNY system.


36
00:01:50.962 --> 00:01:52.796
-Caleb...
-[Stan] He says it all the time.


37
00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.066
I personally would like
to hear a little bit more though


38
00:01:55.199 --> 00:01:56.599
about me being good.

39
00:01:56.733 --> 00:01:58.869
Yes, please.
It'll help with his humility.


40
00:01:59.003 --> 00:02:01.638
That's all he said.
He disappeared on this retreat.


41
00:02:01.771 --> 00:02:05.343
He came back, said nothing,
and then mentioned,


42
00:02:05.475 --> 00:02:08.545
"You know, those two are good."

43
00:02:09.413 --> 00:02:12.549
[Quincy] Uh-uh, Stan.
That is vague as hell.


44
00:02:12.682 --> 00:02:13.985
Where the fuck was he
for three months?


45
00:02:14.118 --> 00:02:15.886
-Quincy.
-What? I'm not mad.


46
00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.989
That was a friendly
"where the fuck."


47
00:02:18.621 --> 00:02:20.157
I can sense the friendliness.

48
00:02:20.291 --> 00:02:21.658
[Quincy scoffs and chuckles]

49
00:02:21.791 --> 00:02:23.327
I mean,
you did miss a few things.


50
00:02:23.793 --> 00:02:25.062
[Caleb] I know. I know.

51
00:02:25.196 --> 00:02:27.264
Mm-hmm.
You missed James's wedding.


52
00:02:27.398 --> 00:02:29.499
Missed implies it was something
I wanted to go to.


53
00:02:29.632 --> 00:02:30.868
[Quincy] Fair.

54
00:02:31.002 --> 00:02:32.635
But you missed my fundraiser.

55
00:02:33.204 --> 00:02:36.506
And you missed Joba's speech for
the annual shareholders meeting.


56
00:02:37.475 --> 00:02:38.742
What was that thing you said?

57
00:02:39.343 --> 00:02:41.045
Oh, uh, just...

58
00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:43.381
technology is the new God,

59
00:02:43.513 --> 00:02:45.216
but we are its masters.

60
00:02:45.782 --> 00:02:47.885
Oh, dramatic.

61
00:02:49.253 --> 00:02:50.653
What god did you mean?

62
00:02:52.023 --> 00:02:54.392
What do you mean? Just God.

63
00:02:54.524 --> 00:02:55.825
The Christian one, I guess.

64
00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.527
Right, but did you mean

65
00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.796
the Old Testament
vengeful motherfucker,


66
00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.566
or the kinder,
friendlier God we know today?


67
00:03:04.902 --> 00:03:06.137
It was a metaphor.

68
00:03:07.371 --> 00:03:08.838
I'd be careful with that.

69
00:03:12.243 --> 00:03:13.610
Okay. [laughs]

70
00:03:14.478 --> 00:03:16.213
[Quincy] It must have been
quite the retreat.


71
00:03:16.914 --> 00:03:18.349
Stan called it a retreat.

72
00:03:18.715 --> 00:03:19.849
[Joba] And you,
what do you call it?


73
00:03:19.984 --> 00:03:21.318
I call it a pilgrimage.

74
00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:24.554
[Quincy] Stan,
you didn't go at all?


75
00:03:24.687 --> 00:03:27.624
No, I just know he went,

76
00:03:27.757 --> 00:03:30.461
came back,
and said it was life-changing.


77
00:03:30.861 --> 00:03:32.430
-[Quincy] Hmm.
-Life-changing?


78
00:03:32.562 --> 00:03:34.564
Well, I thought
Ibiza changed your life.


79
00:03:34.697 --> 00:03:36.901
I was waist-deep in cock
in Ibiza.


80
00:03:37.034 --> 00:03:39.470
-Okay.
-So it was meaningful.


81
00:03:39.602 --> 00:03:42.839
But that's all that Ibiza was.

82
00:03:42.973 --> 00:03:45.109
Well, I mean, that
personally would change my life.


83
00:03:45.242 --> 00:03:46.576
But this was spiritual.

84
00:03:48.446 --> 00:03:50.680
I was in a cabin, in a field.

85
00:03:50.814 --> 00:03:51.982
[Joba] Okay, this is good.

86
00:03:52.116 --> 00:03:53.750
Some human sacrifice vibe,

87
00:03:53.884 --> 00:03:56.120
-blood rituals.
-[Quincy] Baby, let him talk.


88
00:03:56.253 --> 00:03:57.988
And I was alone.

89
00:03:58.456 --> 00:03:59.589
Carla recommended it.

90
00:03:59.722 --> 00:04:00.925
-[Joba] Carla Holmes?
-Mm-hmm.


91
00:04:01.058 --> 00:04:02.560
[Quincy] Who is Carla Holmes?

92
00:04:02.692 --> 00:04:04.562
[Joba] Our parents
came up together.


93
00:04:04.694 --> 00:04:06.230
-Did she have a watch?
-Ah, yes.


94
00:04:06.363 --> 00:04:07.565
The company watches.

95
00:04:07.697 --> 00:04:09.166
Makes it easier
to spot the prick.


96
00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.168
[laughing]

97
00:04:11.902 --> 00:04:13.204
Where's yours, by the way?

98
00:04:13.703 --> 00:04:14.838
I lost it.

99
00:04:14.972 --> 00:04:16.540
You lost your watch?

100
00:04:17.141 --> 00:04:20.911
Anyway, I was in this cabin
in a field, and I was alone.


101
00:04:21.045 --> 00:04:24.681
And I sat and I walked...

102
00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:26.683
and I prayed.

103
00:04:28.185 --> 00:04:30.421
[Joba] You're an atheist.
-Uh-huh.


104
00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.291
And time started to slow down.

105
00:04:34.791 --> 00:04:36.193
It nearly stopped.

106
00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.762
And it was-- it was very hard.

107
00:04:39.897 --> 00:04:44.034
But at the end of it,
I felt good.


108
00:04:45.202 --> 00:04:46.303
Clean.

109
00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:49.739
[Quincy] That's it?

110
00:04:50.707 --> 00:04:52.877
-Essentially.
-[Quincy laughs]


111
00:04:53.878 --> 00:04:55.645
I'm sorry, Caleb, you...

112
00:04:56.313 --> 00:04:58.215
you went to the woods
for three months,


113
00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:01.385
made everybody worry,
fucked off a bunch of promises.


114
00:05:01.519 --> 00:05:03.954
But you feel good.

115
00:05:04.821 --> 00:05:05.890
Cool.

116
00:05:06.756 --> 00:05:09.960
I mean, you could have at least
called about the fundraiser.


117
00:05:10.094 --> 00:05:11.661
What was this fundraiser?

118
00:05:11.794 --> 00:05:14.865
Quincy runs a program for kids

119
00:05:14.999 --> 00:05:16.600
from disadvantaged homes
in the city,


120
00:05:16.733 --> 00:05:19.303
giving them an opportunity to go
to the woods every summer.


121
00:05:19.436 --> 00:05:20.670
It's fake.

122
00:05:20.803 --> 00:05:22.072
[scoffs] Excuse me?

123
00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:26.210
The urban Outward Bound thing
you do, it's fake.


124
00:05:27.178 --> 00:05:30.481
Oh wait, you're joking.
Stan, is he-- He's joking.


125
00:05:30.948 --> 00:05:33.017
I don't know.
You're joking, right?


126
00:05:33.651 --> 00:05:36.887
You send these kids away
for a month to the woods,


127
00:05:37.021 --> 00:05:38.989
and then they spend
the rest of the year


128
00:05:39.123 --> 00:05:41.892
back at whatever hellhole
they came from.


129
00:05:42.026 --> 00:05:44.595
And they're sent by me and you

130
00:05:44.727 --> 00:05:47.598
and Joba and not Stan.

131
00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:48.999
You can't afford it, honey.

132
00:05:49.266 --> 00:05:51.001
And that makes you feel good.

133
00:05:51.135 --> 00:05:52.835
Which is nice for you,

134
00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:57.341
but it doesn't actually
do anything.


135
00:05:58.475 --> 00:05:59.742
It's fake.

136
00:06:01.946 --> 00:06:04.048
[scoffs] Wow, I...

137
00:06:05.049 --> 00:06:08.319
I didn't realize how little
respect you have for me.


138
00:06:08.452 --> 00:06:10.588
-Honey, he's just--
-[Quincy] No, no, no. I'm sorry.


139
00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.022
You give up Netflix for a month

140
00:06:12.156 --> 00:06:13.624
and now
you're the fucking Dalai Lama?


141
00:06:13.756 --> 00:06:15.025
How dare you?

142
00:06:16.961 --> 00:06:19.029
You asked me
what I learned in the woods.


143
00:06:19.997 --> 00:06:21.398
That's something I learned.

144
00:06:23.567 --> 00:06:24.902
Is this the dessert?

145
00:06:25.603 --> 00:06:28.906
You know, honey,
you can have some dessert.


146
00:06:29.673 --> 00:06:30.941
Hmm?

147
00:06:32.276 --> 00:06:33.978
You still think I'm good?

148
00:06:34.945 --> 00:06:36.247
I do.

149
00:06:36.813 --> 00:06:38.515
Angry people can be good.

150
00:06:40.484 --> 00:06:41.751
Get the fuck out.

151
00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:45.356
-Get the fuck out, Caleb.
-Hey. Hey. Just--


152
00:06:45.489 --> 00:06:47.858
[Quincy] Caleb,
get the fuck out.


153
00:06:49.093 --> 00:06:50.427
[Caleb sighs]

154
00:06:52.129 --> 00:06:53.464
Have a good night.

155
00:06:53.597 --> 00:06:55.032
[sighs]

156
00:07:01.939 --> 00:07:04.108
[footsteps departing]

157
00:07:14.685 --> 00:07:15.953
I am sorry.

158
00:07:16.086 --> 00:07:17.288
I-- I don't know
what's wrong with him.


159
00:07:17.421 --> 00:07:19.456
It's fine.
Just a misunderstanding.


160
00:07:19.857 --> 00:07:21.292
Of course it's fine.

161
00:07:22.126 --> 00:07:23.460
It doesn't matter at all.

162
00:07:29.366 --> 00:07:30.434

Caleb. What-- what--

644
00:35:05.856 --> 00:35:07.091
What are you doing here?

645
00:35:07.724 --> 00:35:10.962
Uh, I don't know, frankly.

[Joba panting]

00:35:12.863 --> 00:35:16.100
Wait, no,
maybe you've been following me?


648
00:35:16.233 --> 00:35:18.768
What? No. No.

649
00:35:19.236 --> 00:35:20.837
I was eating a filet.

650
00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:23.407
A filet?

651
00:35:23.807 --> 00:35:26.710
[Caleb] Steak. 
At home, uh...

652
00:35:27.244 --> 00:35:29.413
Stan knows there's something
I'm not telling him.


653
00:35:29.546 --> 00:35:31.382
So he's plying me with meat.

654
00:35:31.848 --> 00:35:35.086
Uh, we had wine and then...

655
00:35:36.786 --> 00:35:39.156
the room spun
and it went dark and...


656
00:35:39.290 --> 00:35:42.592
-You fucking invited us here!
-I know!


657
00:35:43.027 --> 00:35:45.029
-What? To be killed?
-No.


658
00:35:45.162 --> 00:35:48.665
-A pilgrimage, you said.
-It is a pilgrimage.


659
00:35:49.632 --> 00:35:51.168
And now
it's your fucking pilgrimage.


660
00:35:51.302 --> 00:35:54.537
I'm gonna kill--
I'll fucking kill you.


661
00:35:54.671 --> 00:35:57.274
[Caleb] Yeah.
Just like back in school.


662
00:35:58.142 --> 00:35:59.210
I remember.

663
00:36:01.578 --> 00:36:03.214
And my mail, Caleb.

664
00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:04.915
My mail.

665
00:36:05.582 --> 00:36:07.218
They took all of our money.

666
00:36:07.351 --> 00:36:09.453
Our companies are cratering.

667
00:36:09.586 --> 00:36:12.655
They-- they have
my fucking school desk.


668
00:36:12.789 --> 00:36:14.025
[Caleb] Huh.

669
00:36:14.591 --> 00:36:15.792
-Uh-huh.
-They took Quincy.


670
00:36:15.926 --> 00:36:17.694
She's pregnant.
Do you know that?


671
00:36:18.195 --> 00:36:19.263
No.

672
00:36:19.997 --> 00:36:23.666
They have all of our shit.
They know everything. They--


673
00:36:25.568 --> 00:36:26.770
Uh-huh.

674
00:36:26.904 --> 00:36:28.605
Whoever has me out here,
Gano, or--


675
00:36:28.738 --> 00:36:30.941
[Caleb] I never blamed you,
you know.


676
00:36:31.509 --> 00:36:33.543
Your brain was always in that

677
00:36:33.676 --> 00:36:36.780
jock-y, prep school,
pre-evolved mode.


678
00:36:37.481 --> 00:36:38.983
And I was pushy.

679
00:36:40.384 --> 00:36:42.219
This is why you sent me here.

680
00:36:43.154 --> 00:36:46.290
I didn't send you here.
You sent you here.


681
00:36:46.857 --> 00:36:48.292
Then how did you get out?

682
00:36:49.527 --> 00:36:50.794
By giving you up.

683
00:36:52.430 --> 00:36:53.630
So it's a pyramid scheme.

684
00:36:53.998 --> 00:36:56.000
Oh, no. It's just...

685
00:36:56.833 --> 00:36:58.235
it's just survival.

686
00:37:00.337 --> 00:37:04.574
I had to give up
what I held most dear.


687
00:37:05.708 --> 00:37:07.844
My family
are as good as strangers.


688
00:37:08.245 --> 00:37:10.981
I've never had
a meaningful relationship.


689
00:37:11.115 --> 00:37:12.183
So...

690
00:37:13.284 --> 00:37:16.353
I gave up the person
I love most in the world.


691
00:37:17.121 --> 00:37:18.189
My friend.

692
00:37:19.156 --> 00:37:20.257
My best friend.

693
00:37:20.623 --> 00:37:22.193
But where's Quincy?

694
00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:24.228
I don't know.

695
00:37:24.727 --> 00:37:26.230
But I can help you find her.

696
00:37:31.801 --> 00:37:33.104
Fuck!

697
00:37:33.237 --> 00:37:35.339
I bet Stan
is the reason I'm here.


698
00:37:35.738 --> 00:37:38.175
Wait, I thought
you did this alone.


699
00:37:38.576 --> 00:37:40.945
[Caleb] No, I was with Pedro.

700
00:37:41.579 --> 00:37:42.745
Who the fuck is Pedro?

701
00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:45.216
He's hot and dead.

702
00:37:45.715 --> 00:37:46.984
They got him.

703
00:37:47.851 --> 00:37:50.254
Why the fuck am I back here?

704
00:37:50.855 --> 00:37:52.089
I did all the steps.

705
00:37:52.223 --> 00:37:55.159
Repent, submit,
accept, sacrifice.


706
00:37:55.292 --> 00:37:57.727
Wait, wait, wait. What is that?
What is that-- that list?


707
00:37:57.862 --> 00:37:59.762
What is that list you just said?

708
00:38:01.065 --> 00:38:04.634
Repent all of your sins
of the past.


709
00:38:05.102 --> 00:38:08.771
Submit to what
is basest inside you.


710
00:38:09.173 --> 00:38:11.909
Accept all the wickedness

711
00:38:12.042 --> 00:38:13.944
you have yet to acknowledge.

712
00:38:14.879 --> 00:38:17.314
Wait, what is it
that I have yet to accept?


713
00:38:17.448 --> 00:38:19.649
Wait, and then what?
And then what?


714
00:38:19.782 --> 00:38:23.053
And then
after you've done all of that...


715
00:38:23.753 --> 00:38:25.022
you sacrifice.

716
00:38:26.756 --> 00:38:28.092
And that's how you got out?

717
00:38:28.758 --> 00:38:31.728
Yeah. Well, the first time.

718
00:38:34.031 --> 00:38:37.101
So this is repent.

719
00:38:38.235 --> 00:38:39.303
Yeah.

720
00:38:40.703 --> 00:38:41.972
And I'm waiting.

bad people become good.

It's a marvel.
You just wipe it from your mind.

You ship that off
to Joba's people,

so they can put it in their
very important wrist watches.

and the class action suits.

that all settled...

00:55:54.438 --> 00:55:55.506
What do you care?

966
00:55:55.973 --> 00:55:57.274
Well, if a good man comes,

967
00:55:57.408 --> 00:55:59.910
then God will judge us,
set us free.


968
00:56:00.578 --> 00:56:02.379
The Woodsman told you this?

969
00:56:02.745 --> 00:56:04.381
The Woodsman is everything.

970
00:56:05.082 --> 00:56:07.284
-[Joba] He killed your husbands.
-Some of them.


971
00:56:07.651 --> 00:56:08.986
We're not sure which.

972
00:56:09.119 --> 00:56:12.423
Some died
before he could get to them.


973
00:56:13.290 --> 00:56:16.126
He made up this crazy shit
and you believe him?


974
00:56:16.594 --> 00:56:17.962
Faith...

975
00:56:18.529 --> 00:56:20.331
is not simple.

976
00:56:20.931 --> 00:56:22.900
We have to preserve some hope.

977
00:56:23.033 --> 00:56:26.337
-Without hope we're just--
-Hope? Hope?


978

You-- The people
you love are dead.

I lived. I had...

00:56:36.547 --> 00:56:37.615
things, I had friends.

983
00:56:37.747 --> 00:56:38.949
I had Brooklyn. I had a wife.

984
00:56:39.083 --> 00:56:40.517
We were going to have a...

985
00:56:41.818 --> 00:56:43.120
child, we...

986
00:56:43.988 --> 00:56:45.889
No one makes it this far.

987
00:56:46.023 --> 00:56:48.292
We don't cry about what we had,

988
00:56:48.425 --> 00:56:50.793
or who we were,
or dear old Brooklyn.


989
00:56:50.928 --> 00:56:53.130
-Or Marin.
-Or Seattle.

We accept where we are.

Well, how am I supposed to feel?

994
00:57:01.905 --> 00:57:03.340
You sweep in here on the one day

995
00:57:03.474 --> 00:57:05.209
that we raise
our voices to The Woodsman,


996
00:57:05.342 --> 00:57:08.479
admitting, accepting
the weaknesses of our husbands.


997
00:57:08.612 --> 00:57:09.980
How did you even survive?

998
00:57:10.114 --> 00:57:12.516
-Wait. Accepting, you said?
-[Sonia] I did.


999
00:57:13.816 --> 00:57:16.186
So that's this stage then?

1000
00:57:16.320 --> 00:57:17.888
Acceptance, that-- that's here?

1001
00:57:18.022 --> 00:57:19.390
[Sonia] Answer me.

1002
00:57:19.822 --> 00:57:21.392
Why you, not them?

1003
00:57:23.961 --> 00:57:26.297
I killed my best friend.
Maybe that's why.


1004
00:57:27.164 --> 00:57:28.932
But I lost my wife.

1005
00:57:30.934 --> 00:57:32.336
Maybe I'll kill all of you.

1006
00:57:35.005 --> 00:57:37.840

Hmm. Yes. Yeah.

You're so welcome.

[Joba coughs]

What do you do, Joba?

00:58:15.813 --> 00:58:17.915
-[Joba] Hmm?
-Your family?


1017
00:58:18.649 --> 00:58:21.919
Um, we, um, run a watch company.

1018

-Wristwatches.
-Oh. Mm-hmm.

Does that mean something?

Everything means something.

Don't speak in riddles, please.

[Anna laughs]

-Which?
-Bell Atlantic. Hear of it?

Well, yeah, um...

00:58:57.254 --> 00:58:59.757
watches, telephones,
cameras, cars.


1032

It's all old money, right?

00:59:02.159 --> 00:59:04.194
It's legacy industries. It--

Fucking hell, of course.

Whoever is behind this,
someone is teaching us a lesson.

The 1%, right?

They-- they-- they've bled

the lower and middle class
for years.

And now it is our turn. Right?

1042

It's the final act
of a digital revolution.

Why are you asking me?

Either way, it's kinda hot.

If you're God's chosen,
who can resist that?

Or if you're just some bad boy,
making God look like a schmuck,

are you a good man?


1060

[Joba] I don't know.

1061
01:00:04.555 --> 01:00:05.689
I'm a man...

1062
01:00:07.224 --> 01:00:10.327
heir to this company,
but also just the...


1063
01:00:10.994 --> 01:00:12.663
son of a father.

1064
01:00:15.065 --> 01:00:16.333
An only child.

1065
01:00:17.501 --> 01:00:20.704
My dad had inherited
the operation.


1066
01:00:20.838 --> 01:00:22.306
And, um,

1067
01:00:22.439 --> 01:00:25.542
you know, with it,
he was away for work a lot.


1068
01:00:26.443 --> 01:00:30.681
Um, Milan, Geneva,
Glashutte, wherever.


1069
01:00:31.348 --> 01:00:34.117
For a lot of the time
growing up, it was just me,


1070
01:00:34.251 --> 01:00:37.454
my mom, and the various
people we employed.


1071
01:00:38.088 --> 01:00:39.723
I had friends, um.

1072
01:00:40.824 --> 01:00:41.926
But...

1073
01:00:42.826 --> 01:00:46.396
when night would come and...
[chuckles softly]


1074
01:00:46.530 --> 01:00:48.967
...they would all retreat
to the messy chaos


1075
01:00:49.099 --> 01:00:50.701
of their homes and siblings.

1076
01:00:50.834 --> 01:00:53.103
I would always feel a lack

1077
01:00:53.237 --> 01:00:55.305
creep in, a sense
of something missing.


1078
01:00:57.074 --> 01:00:58.742
Got to the point
where my mom knew this.


1079
01:00:58.877 --> 01:01:00.945
And when I turned 11,

1080
01:01:01.078 --> 01:01:03.247
she got me a dog.

1081
01:01:05.215 --> 01:01:07.317
A sweet poodle mix thing.

1082
01:01:07.451 --> 01:01:08.519

1083
01:01:10.621 --> 01:01:14.124
Um, no, I knew I was gonna
take over the company


1084
01:01:14.258 --> 01:01:16.593
since I could
remember anything...


1085
01:01:17.661 --> 01:01:19.630
which, probably
why I never showed any pull


1086
01:01:19.763 --> 01:01:22.000
to make any real
effort at school.


1087
01:01:22.132 --> 01:01:23.567
Find my thing.

1088
01:01:25.135 --> 01:01:26.971
Uh, my behavior was entitled.

1089
01:01:27.104 --> 01:01:28.405
Shitty.

1090
01:01:29.039 --> 01:01:30.307
I was hiding.

1091
01:01:30.807 --> 01:01:32.209
Experimenting.

1092
01:01:35.112 --> 01:01:37.047
This disappointed my dad,
of course.


1093
01:01:37.180 --> 01:01:39.249
Shame of me just coated him.

1094
01:01:40.617 --> 01:01:44.321
It got to the point
where on his little brief stints


1095
01:01:44.454 --> 01:01:47.257
at home with us this time,
I would look forward to


1096
01:01:47.391 --> 01:01:49.159
and treasure more than anything.

1097
01:01:49.293 --> 01:01:51.194
He would start showing
more attention,


1098
01:01:51.328 --> 01:01:52.596
more-- more...

1099
01:01:53.297 --> 01:01:55.699
affection, even to the dog
than to me.


1100
01:01:57.134 --> 01:01:58.669
I mean, the dog was simple,

1101
01:01:58.802 --> 01:02:01.271
pure, and obedient,
where I just--


1102
01:02:02.372 --> 01:02:03.740
I wasn't measuring up.

1103
01:02:07.811 --> 01:02:09.846
Um, one night,

1104
01:02:09.981 --> 01:02:11.081
uh, the phone rang.

1105
01:02:11.848 --> 01:02:15.285
My dad had arrived at JFK,
he-- earlier than expected,


1106
01:02:15.419 --> 01:02:19.222
so he said that he'd be in--
home in time for dinner.


1107
01:02:20.390 --> 01:02:21.792
And earlier that afternoon,

1108
01:02:21.926 --> 01:02:23.794
I had come home
with another shit report card.


1109
01:02:24.561 --> 01:02:26.064
A threat of expulsion.

1110
01:02:26.864 --> 01:02:28.866
And I begged my mom
not to tell my dad,


1111
01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.201
but she insisted
that it was his right to know.


1112
01:02:31.335 --> 01:02:32.769
And so I panicked.

1113
01:02:33.403 --> 01:02:36.040
I, um, I picked up Rufus.

1114
01:02:36.173 --> 01:02:37.708
He was a small dog.

1115
01:02:38.876 --> 01:02:40.510
And, you know,
my mom was downstairs


1116
01:02:40.644 --> 01:02:42.212
so she couldn't hear
anything on the top floor.


1117
01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:44.748
I--

1118
01:02:45.649 --> 01:02:47.351
I grabbed one of those, um...

1119
01:02:48.452 --> 01:02:51.022
those nylon nap sacks that--
the kind you get at--


1120
01:02:51.154 --> 01:02:53.824
at summer camp with the--
with the draw strings.


1121
01:02:55.258 --> 01:02:57.361
And I had to set out
some food for Rufus.


1122
01:02:58.997 --> 01:03:01.698
He dug in and...

1123
