28
00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.510
这里是一堆内脏 没有来自大脑的自我意识
A pile of organs without the spark of self from a brain...


29
00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.760
也没有来自心脏的供血
or the pump of blood from a heart.


30
00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.760
它们就只是屠夫的一顿周日午餐罢了
Just a butcher's tray for a Sunday lunch.


31
00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:05.680
那么我问你们 谁想将这些内脏重新组合到一起
Now, who would like to reconstruct the organs?


32
00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:10.850
而谁又能区分人类与动物 人与动物真的有区别吗
And who can tell human from animal, if there is a difference?


33
00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.850
回答呀
Come, come.


34
00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.890
你们小时候都玩过拼图 对吧
You did puzzles as children, did you not?


35
00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:19.920
不知道是不是只有我这么想
Is it just me,


36
00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:23.220
但你们不觉得 要集中精神听这个怪物讲话 实在太难了吗
or is it devilishly hard to concentrate when the monster's talking?


37
00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.560
他是个非常优秀的外科医生
He is an extraordinary surgeon.


38
00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.640
他的研究极具开创性 他父亲建立了这所学校
His research is groundbreaking. His father founded this place.


39
00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:33.560
你是不是误以为你也能加入我们的谈话马 克斯·麦克坎多斯
Have you mistaken yourself as included in this conversation, Max McCandles?


40
00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:36.140
就算你的座位与我们相邻也不代表你可以加入我们的谈话
Your physical proximity to us does not make it so.


41
00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:38.720
滚开 老东西 买件西装穿吧
Fuck off, old pal. Get yourself a suit.


42
00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:44.720
你真的认为肝脏应该放在这里吗 先生
You really think that's where the liver goes, sir?


43
00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:49.560
将内脏放回去的目的是什么呢 先生
Can I ask what is the purpose of putting them back in, sir?


44
00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.310
让我开心
My amusement.


45
00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:54.220
马克斯·麦克坎多斯先生
Mr. Max McCandles!


46
00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:56.680
这堂课结束后来找我
Walk with me at the end of the lesson.


47
00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:03.390
你的论文
Your paper.


48
00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:05.470
您觉得还行吗 先生
You liked it, sir?


49
00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:10.640
你的论文展现出 一个思想符合常规的人为了仅仅触及平庸就下了很多功夫
It showed signs of a conventional mind straining hard to almost touch mediocrity.


50
00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:13.470
-谢谢您  -我需要一个人助手来参与一个项目
- Thank you. - I need someone. An assistant on a project.


51
00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:14.470
我非常乐意
I would love to.


52
00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:17.470
-你有信仰吗  -我相信古德
- Are you a religious man? - I believe in God.


53
00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:20.680
古德温的昵称"God"意为古德

54
00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:20.680
-你指的是我 还是上帝  -您真幽默 您常被称为...
- Me or the deity? - Humorous, as you're often known as the...


55
00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:22.310
那只是我自己开的玩笑
It is a joke of my own making.


56
00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:24.640
我不需要旁人解释给我自己听
I do not need it explicated for me.


57
00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:26.810
这是恶魔的成果
The very devil's work.


58
00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:28.680
您考虑过蓄胡子吗 先生
Have you thought of growing a beard, sir?


59
00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:30.970
我会看起来像一条戴着领带的大狗
I look like a big dog in a cravat.


60
00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:32.350
小孩们喜欢狗
Kids like dogs.


61
00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:34.100

我修复了她
I repaired it.


75
00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:39.890
她的心理年龄和她的身体并不同步
Her mental age and her body are not quite synchronized.


76
00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:44.310
她还在学习语言 她在飞速进步
Language is coming. She is progressing at an accelerated pace.

她每天能学习十五个词

101
00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:47.640
她的协调性也不太好

102
00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:49.390
在晚上会有些进步
In the evenings, there's progress.


103
00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:53.220
她的头发每两天就能长一英寸

104
00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:55.390
-我这里有相应的图表  -太好了

你可以走了 明天见
You may go. See you tomorrow.


106
00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:01.310
先生 她是从哪里来的
Sir, where did she come from?


107
00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:05.060
你的工作是收集数据
I believe your job is collecting data.


108
00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:08.640
我想让你问我蠢问题时 我会告诉你的
When I add inane questions to it, I'll let you know.


109
00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:16.180
他们从森林里回来后
"And so, when they returned from the wood...


110
00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:19.970
她终于能和爸爸妈妈团聚了
"she was reunited with her Mummy and Daddy.


111

你素我爸爸吗 古德

普瑞姆说你不素

115

贝拉来自无处
Bella nowhere girl.


116

那是什么地方 无处
Where that be? Nowhere?


117

你是个孤儿
You are an orphan.


118
00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:48.430
你父母去世了
Your parents died.


119

然后你把父母切开么 古德

不
No.

是勇敢的探险者
They were brave explorers...


123

他们死于山崩 葬身在南美
and they were killed in a landslide in South America.


124
00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:09.010
他们突破了知识的界限

并付出了代价

126
00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:13.810
但那是唯一的生存之道 贝拉
But that is the only way to live, Bella.


127

是的 我亲爱的
I'm afraid so, my darling.


130

秘鲁 对
Peru, yes.


137
00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:08.180
为什么每个坚果你都要写在本子上
Why you pen book every nut?


138
00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:10.510
我必须记录你的营养摄入

给贝拉讲讲别的地方
Tell Bella other places.


141
00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:29.390
那是里斯本 葡萄牙首都

142
00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:32.310
法国南部 阿尔卑斯山
The south of France. The Alps.


143
00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:37.930
这是澳大利亚
Australia.


144
00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:41.010
很远 很危险 那里的人和动物都很危险
Far away and dangerous, in both people and animal.


145
00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:43.350
贝拉想看世界

00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:49.970

00:13:54.010 --> 00:13:57.390
贝拉 我们不能上去的
Bella, I don't think we're allowed up here.


149
00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:58.600

Let's just...


150
00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:14.470
贝拉
Bella.


151
00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:18.560
贝拉
Bella.


152
00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:21.060
不
No.


153
00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:24.850
贝拉 很危险
Bella, this is dangerous.


154
00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:42.810
贝拉
Bella.


155
00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:45.350
不 贝拉
No, Bella.


156
00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:06.640
古德
God.


157
00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:10.310
外面 必须要去
Outside must go.


158
00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:14.220
外面 不行 我们要工作
Outside? No, we work.


159
00:15:14.890 --> 00:15:15.810
切手指
Cut fingers?


160
00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:18.010
坎多斯带我去 坎多斯
Candles take me. Candles.


161
00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:19.430
当然可以 如果
Of course I can. If...


162
00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:20.760
不
No.


163
00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:22.100
可以 我要出去
Yes. Out!


164
00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.010
她有出去过吗
Has she ever been outside?


165
00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:25.060
没有
No.


166
00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:28.850
我为贝拉创造了一个有趣且安全的完美世界
I have created a perfectly entertaining and safe world for Bella.


167
00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:30.390
我要出去
Now.


168
00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:33.310
-贝拉  -现在
- Bella. - Now!


169
00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:37.350
现在
Now!


170
00:15:37.510 --> 00:15:38.430
贝拉
Bella.


171
00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:09.720
外面有太多能杀掉你的东西 贝拉
You know, so many things outside can kill you, Bella.


172
00:16:09.890 --> 00:16:10.720
杀死
Kill dead?


173
00:16:10.890 --> 00:16:14.010
蛇 马车 尖嘴鸟 地震
Snakes, carriages, sharp-faced birds, earthquakes...


174
00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:16.640
或是吸入毒草籽
inhalation of toxic grass seeds.


175
00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:44.470
贝拉
Bella.


176
00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:47.010
贝拉
Bella.


177
00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:10.310
贝拉 你看
Bella. Look.


178
00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:22.470
-杀了它  -什么
- Kill it. - What?


179
00:17:35.850 --> 00:17:37.720
为什么你大拇指奇怪 古德
Why you funny thumbs, God?


180
00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:44.640
在我很小的时候
Once when I was very small...


181
00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:48.680
我父亲把我的拇指钉在一个小铁盒里
my father pinned my thumbs into a small iron case...


182
00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:51.970
看看能否延缓骨骼的生长周期
to see whether he could retard the growth cycle of bones.


183
00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:55.760
那时我太痛了
Now, the pain was so great...


184
00:17:55.930 --> 00:17:58.060
为了阻止自己哭泣
to stop myself from weeping...


185
00:17:58.220 --> 00:18:01.260
我紧盯着我其他的手指
I would stare deeply into my other fingers...


186
00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:04.100
通过观察
and simply by observation...


187
00:18:04.810 --> 00:18:08.390
开始分析流行病学的因素
begin to parse out the epidemiological elements.


188
00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:10.810
他回来时
When he came back...


189
00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:14.100
看到我在笑 很吃惊
to his surprise, I was smiling.


190
00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:16.930
天哪
Good God.


191
00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:20.350
他有很多不合常规的想法
He was a man of unconventional mind.


192
00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:29.640
该走了
Time to go.


193
00:18:31.390 --> 00:18:33.680
暴风雨就要来了
A storm approaches.


194
00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:39.890
你为什么要这样吓唬她
Why must you scare her so?


195
00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:41.260
她是个实验品
She's an experiment...


196
00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:43.140
我必须控制外界条件
and I must control the conditions...


197
00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:46.560
否则实验结果会不准确
or our results will not be pure.


198
00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:00.180
停下 古德 我们走
Stop! God, we go!


199
00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:01.310
不 贝拉
No, Bella.


200
00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:03.060
贝拉想边走边吃冰淇淋
Bella want walk in ice cream.


201
00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:04.060
不行
No.


202
00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:05.430
贝拉想
Bella wants!


203
00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:07.930
看到这张脸 别人会害怕我
My face. People scared of God.


204
00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:08.970
嘲笑我
Laugh at God.


205
00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:10.430
古德好看
God lovely.


206
00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:11.930
像小狗的脸
Like dog face.


207
00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:15.470
安静
Quite.


208
00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:17.760
-停下 我要走  -不行
- Stop! Me walk. - No!


209
00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:23.060
现在不行 还是永远不行
No now? No never?


210
00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:24.930
就是不行
Just no.


211
00:19:32.470 --> 00:19:34.850
-贝拉  -不
- Bella! - No!


212
00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:37.640
-不 不 不  -喂 贝拉
- No! No! No! - Bella!


213
00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:40.260
不
No!


214
00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:46.890
-抱歉 抱歉  -不
- Sorry. Sorry. - No!


215
00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:48.470
不 不
No! No!


216
00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:04.140
很抱歉 亲爱的
I'm sorry, my darling.


217
00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:07.890
天哪
Mother of God.


218
00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:39.560
你对她做了什么
What did you do to her?


219
00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:41.470
你为什么把她藏起来
Why are you hiding her?


220
00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:44.140
告诉我这是什么意思 不然我就去报警了
Tell me what all this means, or I'll go to the police.


221
00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:50.220
我会告诉你的 因为这是个美好的故事
I shall. For it is a happy tale.


222
00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:11.930
这是一具很罕见的尸体 虽然死了 但离救活就差一步之遥
It is rare to get a body, albeit dead, but so close to life.


223
00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:14.600
尸体还未出现僵硬
Rigor had not set in.


224
00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:17.260
尚有余温
The body had hardly cooled.


225
00:22:17.970 --> 00:22:19.310
没有脉搏
No pulse.


226
00:22:19.890 --> 00:22:22.930
但体内还存在电流 这样我就能保住她的命
But some electric currents, so I could have kept her alive.


227
00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:24.350
但你没有
But you didn't.


228
00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:28.220
我对她所舍弃的人生一无所知
I knew nothing of the life she had abandoned...


229
00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:32.180
我只知道她憎恶过去的生活 才选择抛弃一切
except she hated it so much that she had chosen not to be...


230
00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:33.430
永远离世
and forever.


231
00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:35.180
假若我们将她
What would she feel...


232
00:22:35.930 --> 00:22:40.560
从其审慎选择的虚无来生中带离
on being dragged from her carefully chosen blank eternity...


233
00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:43.560
接着关押在设备简陋且人手不足的疯人院 管教所 或者监狱
and forced to be put in one of our understaffed...


234
00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:47.510
她会作何感想
poorly-equipped madhouses, reformatories or jails?


235
00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:53.470
因为在这个基督教国家 人们视自杀为犯罪或是精神错乱的表现
For in this Christian nation, suicide is treated as lunacy or crime.


236
00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:56.010
我又凭什么决定她的命运
Who was I to decide her fate?


237
00:22:56.640 --> 00:23:00.220
但突然间 我意识到
But then there was also, on my part, a recognition.


238
00:23:00.850 --> 00:23:03.350
我所有的研究就是为了等待这一时刻
All my research had come to this moment.


239
00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:06.100
上天送来了一具死去的身躯
Fate had brought me a dead body...


240
00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:07.260
它孕育的孩子却还活着
and a live infant.


241
00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:08.680
显然是上天的安排
It was obvious.


242
00:23:08.850 --> 00:23:09.760
是吗
It was?


243
00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:11.430
把婴儿的脑子取出来
Take the infant's brain out...


244
00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:14.850
移植进一个成年女性的头中 给她新生 然后观察她
and put it in the full-grown woman, reanimate her, and watch.


245
00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:16.720
天啊
Jesus!


246
00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:10.600
她知道吗
She knows?


247
00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:12.010
不知道
No.


248
00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:13.060
她是谁
Who was she?


249
00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:14.680
不知道
No idea.


250
00:24:15.970 --> 00:24:19.010
但你会宁愿希望贝拉不存在于这个世界上吗
But would you rather the world did not have Bella?


251
00:26:58.680 --> 00:26:59.760
-普瑞姆女士  -嗯
Mrs. Prim?


252
00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:02.640
贝拉找到了想要的快乐
Bella discover happy when she want.


253
00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:06.850
你总是板着个脸 但我有招
You are a sour face, but I fix you.


254
00:27:08.350 --> 00:27:09.470
闭上眼
Close eyes.


255
00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:14.970
-不  -有点耐心 得花点时间
- No! - Just wait. It takes a moment.


256
00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:18.470
她抓住了我带毛的那活
She grabbed my hairy business.


257
00:27:18.930 --> 00:27:19.930
她有病
She's sick!


258
00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:20.930
贝拉
Bella.


259
00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:23.140
贝拉有新发现 必须分享
Bella have discover something I must share.


260
00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:24.140
看着
Watch.


261
00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:27.140
-如果我把黄瓜放进去呢  -不
- What if put cucumber in me? - No.


262
00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:30.430
贝拉 贝拉
Bella! Bella!


263
00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:33.560
不要再抚摸你自己了
Cease working yourself immediately.


264
00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:34.560
什么
What?


265
00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:37.600
在上流社会要举止斯文
In polite society, that is not done.


266
00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:44.060
住手吧
Just do not.


267
00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:55.680
那是什么
What... is that?


268
00:27:56.430 --> 00:27:59.560
我父亲摘除了我的含氧腺和幽门腺
My father took out my oxyntic and pyloric glands...


269
00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:02.260
所以我得自己造胃液
so I must make my own gastric juices.


270
00:28:02.850 --> 00:28:04.180
老天 他为什么要这样做
Why in God's name would he do that?


271
00:28:04.350 --> 00:28:06.760
为了探索未知
To discover what no one knew.


272
00:28:06.930 --> 00:28:09.560
事实证明 理想情况下 我们需要胃液
Turns out we need them. Ideally.


273
00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:12.350
贝拉
Bella...


274
00:28:13.390 --> 00:28:14.810
你还没吃呢
you have not eaten.


275
00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:17.760
不许丢
Do not.


276
00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:27.310
晚安
Good night.


277
00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:29.760
晚安
'Night.


278
00:28:47.810 --> 00:28:52.180
我其实懂点浪漫 马克斯
You know, I'm actually something of a romantic, Max.


279
00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:53.720
什么
What?


280
00:28:53.890 --> 00:28:56.560
我在你和贝拉之间看到了爱的火花
I believe I see love between you and Bella.


281
00:28:58.220 --> 00:28:59.510
呃 我 她
I... She is...


282
00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:02.140
或许你应该娶她
Perhaps you should marry her.


283
00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:03.310
什么
What?


284
00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:04.810
我觉得她也爱你
I think she loves you.


285
00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:10.430
作为旁观者 我见识过
I've seen people look at each other with love...


286
00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:11.640
人们之间充满爱意的注视
as an observer.


287
00:29:11.810 --> 00:29:13.930
当然 并非我亲身经历 是我亲眼所见
Not the subject, of course. I see it.


288
00:29:15.390 --> 00:29:16.390
真的
You do?


289
00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:18.930
我
I...


290
00:29:19.470 --> 00:29:22.260
我确实对她有好感
I do have feelings for her.


291
00:29:22.430 --> 00:29:23.970
所以 你愿意娶她吗
So, you would?


292
00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:26.720
带贝拉走
Take Bella out.


293
00:29:27.970 --> 00:29:29.010
贝拉
Bella...


294
00:29:31.010 --> 00:29:31.890
我
I...


295
00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:35.760
好玩吗
Feel funny?


296
00:29:42.390 --> 00:29:43.220
舔 贝拉
Do Bella.


297
00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:51.390
我还以为
I was wondering...


298
00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:53.970
你养她是让她做情妇的
if perhaps you were raising her to be your mistress.


299
00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:56.470
我知道这是一个阴暗的想法
A dark thought unworthy of me, I know.


300
00:29:57.720 --> 00:30:00.890
所以 你没和她上床
So, you are not laying with her?


301
00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:06.260
射精只会影响我的内环境稳定
Spermatic ejaculation can only induce homeostasis in me...


302
00:30:06.430 --> 00:30:10.430
如果同时还对高级神经中枢进行长时间刺激
if accompanied by prolonged stimulation of higher nerve centers...


303
00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:14.510
会使无导管腺体的压力产生变化 进而改变血液的化学成分
whose pressure on the ductless glands changes the chemistry of my blood...


304
00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:16.810
这样的改变不止持续短短几分钟
not for a few spasmodic minutes...


305
00:30:16.970 --> 00:30:18.310
更是会持续数天
but for many days.


306
00:30:19.810 --> 00:30:20.680
什么
What?


307
00:30:20.850 --> 00:30:23.100
我是个阉人 没办法操她
I am a eunuch and can't fuck her.


308
00:30:23.470 --> 00:30:26.310
要让我的身体产生性反应
To get a sexual response from my body...


309
00:30:26.470 --> 00:30:30.140
需要足以运作整个北伦敦的电量
would take the same amount of electricity as runs North London.


310
00:30:30.850 --> 00:30:33.560
此外 我作为父亲的情感
Besides, my paternal feelings...


311
00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:36.100
看来是超过了我对她的性欲
seem to outweigh my sexual thoughts.


312
00:30:37.810 --> 00:30:40.430
我为我自己污浊的思想道歉
I apologize for my own dark thoughts.


313
00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:41.640
一点也不污浊
Not dark at all.


314
00:30:41.810 --> 00:30:45.970
事实上所有人的性欲从根本上来说都是不道德的
Men's, indeed all sexuality, is basically immoral.


315
00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:47.930
并非所有都如此 先生
Not all, sir.


316
00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:49.890
你到底想不想娶她
Do you wish to marry her or not?


317
00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:54.140
我想和你结婚 做我的妻子吧
I wish to marry you. Be my wife.


318
00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:04.510
让我们互相触摸对方的性器官吧
Let us touch each other's genital pieces.


319
00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:06.100
呃 不
No. No.


320
00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:08.350
我不想占你的便宜
I do not wish to take advantage of you.


321
00:31:08.510 --> 00:31:09.640
你很特别
You are special.


322
00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:11.470
等我们婚后再这样做吧
When we are wed.


323
00:31:18.390 --> 00:31:19.430
有一个条件
One condition.


324
00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:22.220
她必须也想要 我理解
She must desire it also, I understand.


325
00:31:22.390 --> 00:31:23.930
那就是两个条件了
Two conditions, then.


326
00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:25.310
除了你刚刚说的那个
That one you said...


327
00:31:25.470 --> 00:31:29.310
你也必须一直跟我在这里生活
and you must live here with me, always.


328
00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:33.310
我会起草一份法律协议
I will have a legal agreement drawn up.


329
00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:00.720
这份协议很不寻常
Curious contract.


330
00:32:00.890 --> 00:32:02.810
协议里有几处拼写错误
There are several spelling errors.


331
00:32:03.850 --> 00:32:07.140
这并不会影响它的法律约束力 我向您保证
Immaterial to the legal bindingness of it, I assure you.


332
00:32:08.890 --> 00:32:13.060
女方一定是个绝世佳人 条款才如此详尽
Must be quite a woman to warrant such binding.


333
00:32:17.890 --> 00:32:20.060
不好意思 我需要借用一下卫生间
If you'll excuse me, I need to use the facilities.


334
00:32:21.850 --> 00:32:24.510
你才五岁吗 这点都憋不住
Are you five years old that you can't hold your water?


335
00:32:24.930 --> 00:32:29.180
我膀胱不好 先生 遗传自我父亲和我爷爷
Weak bladder, sir. Like my father before me and his before him.


336
00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:31.760
你可能患了前列腺癌 去检查一下吧
You may have prostate cancer. Look into it.


337
00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:33.560
行
Will do.


338
00:33:39.310 --> 00:33:42.560
依协议来看 相信您就是贝拉·巴克斯特女士了
Ms. Bella Baxter, as per your contract, no doubt.


339
00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:45.310
下午好 来访的男人
Good afternoon, visiting man.


340
00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:47.350
想要我的帽子吗
Want my hat?


341
00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:49.470
它适合我吗
Would it suit me?


342
00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:51.140
适合
Yes.


343
00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:54.140
又傻又可爱
It is foolish good.


344
00:33:54.310 --> 00:33:55.430
我必须要见一见到底是怎样一位女士
I had to meet this woman...


345
00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:59.220
为她起草的婚姻协议居然要把她关在家里
who would inspire such a contract of marriage that imprisons her.


346
00:34:00.140 --> 00:34:01.310
你是什么意思
What you mean?


347
00:34:01.470 --> 00:34:02.430
你要住在这里
You shall live here...


348
00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:05.890
要与马克斯·麦克坎多斯先生和巴克斯特先生一同外出
travel with Mr. Max McCandles and Baxter abroad...


349
00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:07.930
但不能进城区
but not go forth in the city.


350
00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:09.760
我知道
I see.


351
00:34:10.890 --> 00:34:12.140
他们很爱我
They love me tight.


352
00:34:12.310 --> 00:34:13.810
我理解
I understand why.


353
00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:16.010
我得掐你一下 来确定你到底是不是真的
I have to pinch you, to see if you are real.


354
00:34:16.180 --> 00:34:17.180
你才不能 啊
You will not...


355
00:34:20.850 --> 00:34:22.060
你素谁
Who is you?


356
00:34:24.810 --> 00:34:26.810
我是邓肯·维德伯恩先生
Mr. Duncan Wedderburn.


357
00:34:57.680 --> 00:34:58.510
开门
Open.


358
00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:10.350
你怎么上来的
How you get up here?


359
00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:13.560
我爬上来的
I climbed.


360
00:35:32.470 --> 00:35:33.850
你看我很久了吗
You were watch me long?


361
00:35:34.010 --> 00:35:35.310
没多久
Not long.


362
00:35:35.470 --> 00:35:38.890
你不会看到我为了寻开心而抚摸自己了吧
You did not see me working on myself to get happiness, did you?


363
00:35:39.970 --> 00:35:42.010
我知道这样的举止不斯文
It is not polites, I know.


364
00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:49.390
我不在乎上流社会的规矩
Do not care for polite society.


365
00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:50.680
那太无聊了
It's fucking boring.


366
00:35:51.470 --> 00:35:52.810
能摧毁一个人的灵魂
Destroys one's soul.


367
00:35:53.930 --> 00:35:55.430
古德不相信灵魂
God not believe in soul.


368
00:35:56.890 --> 00:36:00.100
我认为古德正是灵魂这个概念的创始人
I think God's the actual author of the soul idea.


369
00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:02.140
古德温·巴克斯特
Godwin Baxter?


370
00:36:02.310 --> 00:36:04.100
那只油尽灯枯的老狗
That burnt dog.


371
00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:05.810
到底是怎么回事
What is that story?


372
00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:09.220
你是个囚徒 而我要解放你
You are a prisoner and I aim to free you.


373
00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:14.180
你身体里有一股渴望的力量
Something in you, some hungry being...


374
00:36:14.350 --> 00:36:17.060
渴望体验 自由 和触碰
hungry for experience, freedom, touch.


375
00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:19.310
发现未知并了解未知
To see the unknown and know it.


376
00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:22.430
所以 你会问我为什么在这里
So, why am I here, you ask?


377
00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:26.640
我周五要去里斯本 希望你能来
I'm going to Lisbon on Friday. I'd like you to come.


378
00:36:26.810 --> 00:36:28.430
葡萄牙的里斯本
Lisbon of Portugal?


379
00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:30.640
正是我说的里斯本
That is the Lisbon I speak of.


380
00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:33.560
古德不会同意的
God never allow it.


381
00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:37.760
所以我不问他
That's why I'm not asking him.


382
00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:40.640
我问的是你
I'm asking you.


383
00:36:42.850 --> 00:36:45.010
我觉得 贝拉和你待在一起不安全
Bella not safe with you, I think.


384
00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:48.350
你当然不安全
You are absolutely... not.


385
00:37:03.390 --> 00:37:06.760
能占用你一点宝贵的时间吗 亲爱的古德
May I have a moment of value time, dear God?


386
00:37:06.930 --> 00:37:08.220
当然 贝拉
Of course, Bella.


387
00:37:08.390 --> 00:37:10.970
我想告诉你一个大消息
I wanted to tell you big news.


388
00:37:11.140 --> 00:37:13.220
贝拉兴奋得头晕目眩
Bella is dizzy with excite.


389
00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:14.510
是什么事
What is it?


390
00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:16.470
今天午夜
Tonight, at midnight...


391
00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:20.760
我悄悄和一个叫邓肯·维德伯恩的男人逃走
I secretly run away with one Duncan Wedderburn.


392
00:37:20.930 --> 00:37:21.970
什么
What?


393
00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:23.430
你会想要阻止我
You will wish to stop me.


394
00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:24.600
我会阻止你
I shall stop you.


395
00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:26.510
你把贝拉管得太严了
You hold Bella too tight.


396
00:37:27.220 --> 00:37:28.930
我必须去海上看看
I must set forth into waters.


397
00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:30.100
我们可以旅行
We can travel.


398
00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:33.060
我 你 和马克斯
You, me, and Max whom, I will remind you...


399
00:37:33.220 --> 00:37:34.510
我得提醒你 你和马克斯订婚了
you are betrothed to.


400
00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:36.350
我会和马克斯结婚
I will marry Max...


401
00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:39.010
因为他看起来很合适做我丈夫
as he seems right for that...


402
00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:42.850
但首先 我要和邓肯·维德伯恩去冒险
but first, I shall adventure on Duncan Wedderburn...


403
00:37:43.010 --> 00:37:46.640
虽然他对我受伤毫不在意
who, I think, cares little of damage to me...


404
00:37:46.810 --> 00:37:50.390
但他也很有趣
but will be interesting as well.


405
00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:52.060
我不会让你去的
I can't let you go.


406
00:37:58.890 --> 00:38:00.850
吻我 然后让我离开
Kiss me and set me forth.


407
00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:02.810
否则
If you do not...


408
00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:07.220
贝拉的内脏会因仇恨而腐烂
Bella's insides shall turn rotten with hate.


409
00:38:07.390 --> 00:38:09.600
-仇恨  -仇恨
- Hate? - Hate.


410
00:38:18.140 --> 00:38:19.970
打开包 普瑞姆
Unpack those bags, Prim.


411
00:38:20.140 --> 00:38:22.010
古德温告诉我你的计划了
Godwin has told me your plan.


412
00:38:22.180 --> 00:38:23.310
我不怪你 贝拉
I do not blame you, Bella.


413
00:38:23.470 --> 00:38:25.220
那个人是个无赖和浪子
That man is a cad and a rake.


414
00:38:25.390 --> 00:38:28.180
他用阴险的手段让天真的女人动心
He has insidious ways of getting under a naive woman's skin.


415
00:38:28.350 --> 00:38:30.760
可能是他看我的眼神
It is mostly his eyes on mine.


416
00:38:30.930 --> 00:38:33.680
触摸我双腿之间的手
And his hands when between Bella's legs...


417
00:38:34.180 --> 00:38:36.260
和听不清的轻声细语
and whisper words I can't hear...


418
00:38:36.430 --> 00:38:38.350
但让我欲火焚身
but heat in my body.


419
00:38:38.510 --> 00:38:39.890
天啊 贝拉
Jesus, Bella.


420
00:38:40.060 --> 00:38:41.430
我们订婚了
We are engaged.


421
00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:42.350
我爱你
I love you.


422
00:38:42.510 --> 00:38:44.560
我回来之后 我们就结婚
And when I return, we marriage...


423
00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:46.850
像树枝上的两只鸽子一样快乐
and be happy as two doves on a branch.


424
00:38:47.010 --> 00:38:48.760
-你觉得我需要旅行帽吗  -不
- You think I need travel hat? - No!


425
00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:50.350
这件事不可能发生
This will not do.


426
00:38:50.930 --> 00:38:52.260
我不许你去
It cannot!


427
00:38:52.430 --> 00:38:53.720
我要亲自对付这个人
I'll see to this man myself.


428
00:38:54.430 --> 00:38:58.260
我会把他英俊的脸打得血肉模糊
I will beat his handsome face into a porridge of blood and bones!


429
00:38:58.430 --> 00:39:00.140
马克斯 你脸红了
Max, you are flushed...


430
00:39:00.310 --> 00:39:02.600
我居然看到了不一样的马克思
and I am too at sight of different Max.


431
00:39:02.810 --> 00:39:03.510
不好意思
I apologize...


432
00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:09.760
但我不会让一个满是恶意 心里完全没有你的男人欺骗你
but I will not let a man that I know has nothing but ill intent in his mind... and nothing for you in his heart trick you.


433
00:39:09.930 --> 00:39:12.720
我他妈要把他的头打烂
I will smash his fucking head in.


434
00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:29.350
贝拉 这
Bella? It...


435
00:39:33.810 --> 00:39:34.720
贝拉
Bella.


436
00:39:43.010 --> 00:39:45.390
再见 未来的鸽子
Goodbye, later dove.


437
00:39:46.060 --> 00:39:48.140
我会在大冒险之后回来见你
I will see you after grand adventure.


438
00:39:50.260 --> 00:39:51.100
古德
God?


439
00:40:31.930 --> 00:40:32.850
她走了
She's gone.


440
00:40:33.890 --> 00:40:36.390
我早餐在喝波特酒
I am having port for breakfast.


441
00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:38.510
它异常好喝
It is strangely delicious.


442
00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:40.350
你为什么不阻止她
Why did you not stop her?


443
00:40:41.350 --> 00:40:43.510
她本就有自由意志
She is a being of free will.


444
00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:49.930
她现在在外面孤身一人
She's now out there. Alone.


445
00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:51.970
她会没事的
She will be fine.


446
00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:54.100
我是个傻瓜 我本该阻止她的
I'm a fool. I should have stopped her.


447
00:40:54.260 --> 00:40:56.220
我们是搞科学的人
We are men of science.


448
00:40:57.260 --> 00:41:00.850
你不该这么情绪化
This emotionality is unseemly.


449
00:41:04.430 --> 00:41:05.970
我只希望她没事
I just hope she's all right.


450
00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:30.640
你是我见过的最美的女人
You are the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.


451
00:41:31.390 --> 00:41:33.220
我没说谎 我和很多女人在一起过
I will not lie, I have been with many.


452
00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:37.060
普瑞姆女士说 你身上有一百个女人的香水味
Mrs. Prim said you were wolf with scent of hundred women on you.


453
00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:38.600
她说少了
She undersells it.


454
00:41:39.220 --> 00:41:41.720
好的 牡蛎
Okay. Oysters.


455
00:41:41.890 --> 00:41:43.470
你吃过牡蛎吗
Have you had them before?


456
00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:44.810
没有
I have not.


457
00:41:49.180 --> 00:41:51.100
开壳 去壳 一口吞掉
Shuck, chuck and bubble.


458
00:42:02.100 --> 00:42:03.010
真不错
Rollicking.


459
00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:07.760
真不错
Rollicking.


460
00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:12.680
等等 贝拉
Wait. Bella.


461
00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:21.560
里斯本

462
00:42:22.060 --> 00:42:25.010
修道士和修女们会用蛋白来浆洗衣服
So, nuns and monks would starch their clothes with egg whites...


463
00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:27.350
然后用蛋黄来做蛋挞
and, with the yolks, make these tarts.


464
00:42:27.970 --> 00:42:29.060
这该怎么吃呢
Now, how to eat them?


465
00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:30.850
我猜是用嘴吃
I will guess through the mouth.


466
00:42:31.010 --> 00:42:33.930
它们不应该一小口一小口地吃
They must not be eaten dainty flake by dainty flake...


467
00:42:34.100 --> 00:42:36.970
而应该大口享用 就像享受生活一样
but inhaled with gusto, like life itself.


468
00:42:43.430 --> 00:42:44.720
棒极了
Incredible.


469
00:42:45.850 --> 00:42:47.720
这是谁做的 我还想要几个
Who made these? We need more.


470
00:42:47.970 --> 00:42:50.430
没了 一个够了 再多就过分了
No more. One's enough. Any more is too much.


471
00:42:51.430 --> 00:42:52.760
现在是午休时间
It's siesta time.


472
00:42:52.930 --> 00:42:54.510
什么是午休时间
What is siesta?


473
00:43:21.390 --> 00:43:23.850
人们为什么不能
Why do people not just do this...


474
00:43:24.010 --> 00:43:25.310
一直做爱呢
all the time?


475
00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:29.140
好吧 不是我自夸
Well, at the risk of being immodest...


476
00:43:29.310 --> 00:43:32.140
你刚刚和最棒的人做了三次
you've just been thrice fucked by the very best.


477
00:43:32.310 --> 00:43:35.100
可能没有其他男人能带给你这样的快乐
It's probable no other man would ever bring you to the raptures I have.


478
00:43:36.850 --> 00:43:38.010
真为你感到难过
I feel bad for you.


479
00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:43.100
那我就只和你一起做激烈跳跃
Well, then it will just be you I do furious jumping with.


480
00:43:43.970 --> 00:43:45.470
激烈跳跃
Furious jumping?


481
00:43:46.140 --> 00:43:47.220
我喜欢这个说法
I love that.


482
00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:49.060
我休息好了
I'm rested.


483
00:43:49.850 --> 00:43:50.890
我们再来一次
Let us go again.


484
00:43:51.060 --> 00:43:52.180
再一次
Again?


485
00:43:52.890 --> 00:43:54.430
遗憾的是
Unfortunately...


486
00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:56.140
即使是我也有极限
even I have my limits.


487
00:43:56.310 --> 00:43:58.600
男人不能索要无度
Men cannot keep coming back for more.


488
00:43:58.760 --> 00:44:00.970
这是生理问题吗
It is a physiological problem?


489
00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:03.180
是男人的弱点吗
A weakness in men?


490
00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:05.560
嗯
Well...


491
00:44:07.890 --> 00:44:09.350
可能吧
Perhaps so.


492
00:44:10.890 --> 00:44:12.850
如果还不算太晚的话
You'd be advised, if it's not too late...


493
00:44:13.010 --> 00:44:14.760
你最好别爱上我
not to fall in love with me.


494
00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:16.890
我不能承诺任何的
I have very little to offer...


495
00:44:17.060 --> 00:44:18.760
天长地久
in the way of constancy.


496
00:44:18.970 --> 00:44:20.100
只有冒险
Just adventure.


497
00:44:20.260 --> 00:44:21.430
知道了
I see.


498
00:44:22.970 --> 00:44:24.100
睡觉吧
Let us sleep.


499
00:44:52.850 --> 00:44:53.850
女士需要打车吗
Taxi, madam?


500
00:48:34.510 --> 00:48:35.470
晚上好
Good evening...


501
00:48:37.390 --> 00:48:38.260
邓肯·维德伯恩
Duncan Wedderburn.


502
00:48:38.760 --> 00:48:40.810
贝拉 你去哪儿了 你怎么不见了
Bella, where were you? You disappeared.


503
00:48:41.510 --> 00:48:42.720
我没有
I did not.


504
00:48:43.470 --> 00:48:45.430
没有人会消失
Nobody can just disappear.


505
00:48:45.930 --> 00:48:46.890
什么
What?


506
00:48:47.060 --> 00:48:48.680
人们能消失吗
Can they? Disappear?


507
00:48:48.850 --> 00:48:51.850
不能 当然不能 你在说什么鬼话
No, of course not. What the fuck are you talking...


508
00:48:52.010 --> 00:48:52.930
你去哪儿了
Where were you?


509
00:48:53.100 --> 00:48:56.760
我想吃蛋挞 然后经历了一场冒险
I wanted a tart and then an adventure befell me.


510
00:48:56.930 --> 00:48:59.850
我不知道怎么回来 然后就听到了一个声音
I did not know how to return and then I heard it.


511
00:49:00.010 --> 00:49:00.850
电车的声音
The tram.


512
00:49:01.010 --> 00:49:03.760
我朝着声音走过去 还真让我找到了
I will walk to the noise, and I found it.


513
00:49:03.930 --> 00:49:05.430
我很惊喜
Amazement to Bella.


514
00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:07.060
我真是天生的探险家
Explorer bloods in me.


515
00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:09.100
贝拉 你独自外出是很危险的
Bella, it's dangerous to go out without me.


516
00:49:09.260 --> 00:49:12.510
我刚经历了一次冒险 只找到了糖和暴力
I have adventured it and found nothing but sugar and violence.


517
00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:14.180
这是最迷人的
It is most charming.


518
00:49:14.350 --> 00:49:15.430
我没事
I am fine.


519
00:49:16.100 --> 00:49:20.100
现在 我必须躺下 你必须压在我身上做更多激烈跳跃
Now, I must lie down and you must lie down on top of me and do more furious jumping.


520
00:49:24.220 --> 00:49:25.010
凯蒂
Kitty.


521
00:49:26.220 --> 00:49:28.600
你看过王尔德在伦敦的新剧吗
Did you see the new show in London by Wilde?


522
00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:29.970
妙趣横生
Marvelously witty.


523
00:49:30.140 --> 00:49:31.260
我很喜欢
I loved it.


524
00:49:31.430 --> 00:49:33.010
一个手提包
"A handbag."


525
00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:38.680
贝拉
Bella.


526
00:49:40.060 --> 00:49:41.010
怎么了
What?


527
00:49:42.350 --> 00:49:45.180
如果这令人作呕 我不吐出来还能干嘛
Why I keep it in my mouth if it is revolting?


528
00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:47.930
我之前对杰拉德这么说过
I have said that before to Gerald.


529
00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:51.720
-如果你明白我的意思  -呃
If you catch my drift.


530
00:49:53.010 --> 00:49:54.310
你真邪恶
You are wicked.


531
00:49:54.470 --> 00:49:56.510
噢 因为你指的是他的鸡鸡
Oh. Because you mean his penis.


532
00:49:58.890 --> 00:50:00.760
邓肯的鸡鸡有时候有点咸
Duncan's can sometimes be salty.


533
00:50:04.680 --> 00:50:05.760
老天啊 贝拉
Good God, Bella.


534
00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:09.310
我必须去打那个小孩一顿
I must go punch that baby.


535
00:50:14.010 --> 00:50:14.850
贝拉
Bella.


536
00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:22.060
你的行为太荒谬了
Your behavior is unconscionable.


537
00:50:22.220 --> 00:50:23.350
你能听话吗
Will you behave?


538
00:50:23.510 --> 00:50:25.680
食物让我喉咙发干
The food was cacking my throat...


539
00:50:25.850 --> 00:50:27.350
那个孩子哭得让我气恼
the baby annoying...


540
00:50:27.510 --> 00:50:29.760
还有那个女人的话让我厌烦
and the woman boring with words.


541
00:50:29.930 --> 00:50:31.100
你将会回到餐桌前
You will rejoin the table...


542
00:50:31.260 --> 00:50:34.060
只说以下三句话
and will confine yourself to the following three phrases...


543
00:50:34.220 --> 00:50:36.390
太神奇了 高兴极了
"How marvelous!", "Delighted"...


544
00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:40.180
还有 他们怎么把糕点做得这么酥脆的 明白吗
and "How did they make the pastry so crisp?" Yes?


545
00:50:40.850 --> 00:50:42.310
你弄疼贝拉了
You are hurting Bella.


546
00:50:42.470 --> 00:50:43.720
抱歉
Sorry.


547
00:50:43.890 --> 00:50:45.850
是我不够理智
Reason does not penetrate.


548
00:50:46.010 --> 00:50:46.810
我们走
Let us go.


549
00:51:04.390 --> 00:51:06.890
你喜欢里斯本吗 贝拉
Are you enjoying Lisbon, Bella?


550
00:51:09.010 --> 00:51:09.970
高兴极了
Delighted.


551
00:51:12.100 --> 00:51:14.560
凯蒂 你亲爱的父亲还好吗
Kitty, how is your dear father?


552
00:51:15.140 --> 00:51:16.060
他很不好
He's very unwell.


553
00:51:16.760 --> 00:51:18.560
我担心他活不过今年
I fear he will not see the year out.


554
00:51:18.930 --> 00:51:20.010
-噢  -太神奇了
How marvelous.


555
00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:22.600
他们怎么把糕点做得这么酥脆的
How did they get the pastry so crisp?


556
00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:42.810
老天啊
Good God.


557
00:51:43.640 --> 00:51:44.720
怎么了
What is it?


558
00:51:45.850 --> 00:51:46.930
她寄来的
From her.


559
00:51:50.260 --> 00:51:52.680
我好 里斯本
"Me good. Lisbon.


560
00:51:53.180 --> 00:51:56.140
糖挞每天都舔我
"Sugar tart lick me all day."


561
00:51:57.680 --> 00:51:59.640
至少都是一整句话
At least I hope that's all one sentence, anyway.


562
00:52:00.100 --> 00:52:00.850
-你觉得他们  -在做爱
- Do you think they're... - Fucking?


563
00:52:01.010 --> 00:52:01.850
对
Yes.


564
00:52:03.470 --> 00:52:04.260
还有
Also...


565
00:52:04.970 --> 00:52:06.350
她在给有轨电车口交
fellating a tram.


566
00:53:19.100 --> 00:53:22.350
你也头疼吗 邓肯·维德伯恩
Does your head ache too, Duncan Wedderburn?


567
00:53:22.510 --> 00:53:24.970
我也饿得想吃晚饭了
And I also am starving for dinner.


568
00:53:25.140 --> 00:53:26.720
你他妈去哪了
Where the fuck were you?


569
00:53:30.060 --> 00:53:31.850
你是维多利亚·帕辛顿
Victoria Blessington?


570
00:53:33.350 --> 00:53:35.220
我有很多年没见过你了
I haven't seen you for years.


571
00:53:35.390 --> 00:53:37.180
你还是没见到她
And you still have not...


572
00:53:37.350 --> 00:53:39.680
因为我是贝拉·巴克斯特
as I am Bella Baxter...


573
00:53:39.850 --> 00:53:41.560
奇怪的羽毛女士
strange feathered lady.


574
00:53:41.720 --> 00:53:44.470
真抱歉 我发誓你跟她长得一模一样
I apologize. I could've sworn you were she.


575
00:53:49.470 --> 00:53:50.470
没错
Right.


576
00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:51.850
我们能走了吗
Shall we?


577
00:53:53.060 --> 00:53:55.260
牛排 鱼
The steak, the fish...


578
00:53:55.430 --> 00:53:57.560
罐装小焦糖
little caramel things in pots...


579
00:53:57.720 --> 00:54:00.140
跟那桌的一样
that old spotted people over there have.


580
00:54:00.310 --> 00:54:01.970
我不想吃罐装小焦糖
I don't want caramel in pots.


581
00:54:02.350 --> 00:54:04.560
当然不是给你的 都是给贝拉的
Of course not. That was all for Bella.


582
00:54:05.060 --> 00:54:06.180
你点你要的吧
Order at your whim.


583
00:54:07.560 --> 00:54:10.680
贝拉外出探险 你很生气
You are cross at Bella's outings and adventures.


584
00:54:10.850 --> 00:54:13.010
但邓肯·维德伯恩在与贝拉·巴克斯特
And yet we must discover by whim...


585
00:54:13.180 --> 00:54:16.060
第一天在里斯本爱恋时对她说
as spoken by Duncan Wedderburn to Bella Baxter...


586
00:54:16.260 --> 00:54:17.760
我们必须通过突发奇想来探索
day one of Lisbon love affair.


587
00:54:18.600 --> 00:54:19.350
说得好
Touché.


588
00:54:19.510 --> 00:54:21.810
请理解我 我从未在古德的房子外生活过
Understand me never lived outside God's house.


589
00:54:21.970 --> 00:54:22.680
什么
What?


590
00:54:22.850 --> 00:54:25.220
所以 贝拉有太多东西需要探索
So, Bella so much to discover...


591
00:54:25.390 --> 00:54:27.560
而你悲伤的表情
and your sad face...


592
00:54:28.010 --> 00:54:31.060
让我发现 我对你很愤怒
makes me discover angry feelings for you.


593
00:54:32.760 --> 00:54:33.640
行
Right.


594
00:54:35.810 --> 00:54:37.140
我成了我最恨痛的那种人
I have become the very thing I hate...


595
00:54:37.310 --> 00:54:39.680
渴求爱的妖物
a grasping succubus of a lover.


596
00:54:41.260 --> 00:54:43.600
我赶走了许多爱上我的人 现在自己却要被赶走了
I've pried many of them off me and now I'm it.


597
00:54:44.140 --> 00:54:44.970
操
Fuck!


598
00:55:52.470 --> 00:55:55.510
你和我一样 现在是自由的生物
You, like me, are a creature of freedom in the moments.


599
00:55:58.510 --> 00:55:59.760
你为什么一直眨眼
What do you keep doing that for?


600
00:56:00.850 --> 00:56:03.010
那个男的一直朝我眨眼
A man over there repeated blinks at me.


601
00:56:03.930 --> 00:56:05.350
我也眨眼
I blink back.


602
00:56:05.510 --> 00:56:06.890
出于礼貌 应该是
For polites, I think.


603
00:56:19.060 --> 00:56:21.760
我们要去镇上跳舞了 请和我们一起吧
We are going to dance in town. Please join us.


604
00:56:21.930 --> 00:56:24.010
我从没在镇上跳过舞
I have never danced in town.


605
00:56:36.680 --> 00:56:38.310
邓肯 不行
- Duncan! - Can't!


606
00:56:52.470 --> 00:56:53.310
你非常生气
You're quite mad.


607
00:56:53.470 --> 00:56:56.390
不要说话了 你的声音让贝拉愤怒
Stop talking as your sounds make Bella angry!


608
00:56:56.560 --> 00:56:57.810
我要说
I will not stop talking.


609
00:56:57.970 --> 00:56:58.970
如果我有想说的话 我就要
If I have something to say I'll...


610
00:56:59.140 --> 00:57:00.060
啊
Ouch.


611
00:57:08.060 --> 00:57:08.850
行吧
All right.


612
00:57:12.930 --> 00:57:13.680
这是什么
What's this?


613
00:57:17.060 --> 00:57:19.350
之前 有一个人教我下国际象棋
A man was teaching me chess...


614
00:57:19.510 --> 00:57:24.140
他说他认为我的皮肤是他摸过最柔软的
and he said he thought I would probably have the softest skin he had ever touched.


615
00:57:24.310 --> 00:57:28.720
我说 如果是的话 可以在大腿内侧测试
And I said, if I did it would be the inner thighs to test...


616
00:57:28.890 --> 00:57:32.060
因为那里的表皮最光滑
as that is where the epidermis is at its most fine.


617
00:57:32.220 --> 00:57:33.310
所以我们就测试了
So we tested...


618
00:57:33.470 --> 00:57:35.560
确实是最柔软的
and it was the softest ever.


619
00:57:36.350 --> 00:57:39.640
我想知道软度会不会有区别
I wondered if perhaps they're not equal in softitude.


620
00:57:39.810 --> 00:57:41.260
确实也不同
Indeed they were not.


621
00:57:41.430 --> 00:57:44.470
所以我就记录了一下哪个是哪个
So I made sure to note it, remembering which was which.


622
00:57:50.810 --> 00:57:54.060
刚刚你说的要舔我呢
What of the tongue play you were about to perform?


623
00:57:58.010 --> 00:57:59.600
你不舔了吗
Is that not happening?


624
00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:18.810
你
You...


625
00:58:21.350 --> 00:58:22.600
你心事重重
You are troubled.


626
00:58:24.140 --> 00:58:25.350
他和你上床了吗
Did he lie with you?


627
00:58:26.180 --> 00:58:27.850
没有 我们靠着墙
No, we were against a wall.


628
00:58:28.850 --> 00:58:30.470
你在他身上了激烈跳跃了吗
Did you furious jump him?


629
00:58:30.640 --> 00:58:33.810
没有 他只是快速舔了我的阴蒂
No, he just fast-licked my clitoris.


630
00:58:33.970 --> 00:58:37.720
我内心的欲火需要释放 所以我就释放出来了
I had the heat that needed release, so at my request it was.


631
00:58:41.060 --> 00:58:43.220
你也可以舔我
You, too, may tongue play me...


632
00:58:43.390 --> 00:58:48.220
所以我不明白这种复杂的情绪
so I'm not understanding this complicated feeling.


633
00:58:51.470 --> 00:58:53.010
你在哭吗
Are you now crying?


634
00:59:01.510 --> 00:59:05.470
你真是个迷惑的人 邓肯·维德伯恩
What a confusing person you are, Duncan Wedderburn.


635
00:59:05.640 --> 00:59:06.930
肝脏
A liver.


636
00:59:16.470 --> 00:59:19.180
一个小切口
A small incision...


637
00:59:19.760 --> 00:59:22.930
就足够了
is all that is needed.


638
00:59:36.850 --> 00:59:38.810
我一早上都在用氯仿麻醉山羊
I was chloroforming goats all morning.


639
00:59:38.970 --> 00:59:41.390
可能我也吸入太多了
I may have ingested too much.


640
00:59:41.560 --> 00:59:46.430
我大胆地猜测 您因为贝拉不在而感到不安
I am going to venture to suggest you are upset by Bella's absence.


641
00:59:46.600 --> 00:59:48.220
您狂喝波特酒
The liters of port...


642
00:59:48.390 --> 00:59:49.970
我晚上还听到您在哭
the sobbing I hear at night.


643
00:59:50.140 --> 00:59:53.010
我的老天 你个碎嘴的蠢货
Good God, man! You prattle like an imbecile.


644
00:59:53.180 --> 00:59:54.470
她已经走了
She is gone!


645
00:59:55.850 --> 00:59:57.720
我是个科学家
I am a man of science.


646
00:59:57.890 --> 01:00:00.970
我只需要考虑推进我的项目
I just need to engage in, and continue, the project.


647
01:00:01.140 --> 01:00:04.140
仅此而已 我要继续下一个研究项目了
That is all. I must go on to the next thing.


648
01:00:04.310 --> 01:00:06.680
我们的感情必须搁置一旁
Our feelings must be put aside.


649
01:00:07.510 --> 01:00:10.390
你觉得如果我的父亲不把科学与进步放在第一位
Do you think my father could have branded me...


650
01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:13.260
他还会像他那样
with hot irons on the genitals the way he did...


651
01:00:13.430 --> 01:00:16.510
用烙铁给我的生殖器打烙印吗
if he could not put science and progress first?


652
01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:17.430
打烙印
Branded you?


653
01:00:19.970 --> 01:00:22.140
我们找一具尸体吧
Let us find a body.


654
01:00:23.470 --> 01:00:24.720
找什么
A what?


655
01:00:47.890 --> 01:00:49.060
嗨 早上好
Hello. Good morning.


656
01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:53.180
早上好 亲爱的
Good morning, darling.


657
01:00:57.600 --> 01:01:00.810
之前我没有全心全意支持你的冒险精神
I haven't been very supportive of your adventurous spirit.


658
01:01:00.970 --> 01:01:02.600
所以我准备了一个惊喜
So I have a surprise for you.


659
01:01:11.140 --> 01:01:12.100
进来吧
Get in.


660
01:01:26.510 --> 01:01:29.430
-我们换酒店了吗  -看窗外 贝拉
- We changed hotels? - Look out the window, Bella.


661
01:01:41.140 --> 01:01:43.060
-我们在船上  -是的
- We're on boat? - Indeed.


662
01:01:44.260 --> 01:01:48.470
你想把贝拉困在海上 我决定要带你踏上新的冒险
- You aim to trap Bella at sea. - I aim to give you a new adventure.


663
01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:51.180
我想我能更容易找到你
I suppose it's true you'll be easier to find.


664
01:01:51.350 --> 01:01:53.890
来吧 扒光我的衣服
Come, disrobe me.


665
01:01:54.060 --> 01:01:55.010
骑上来
Ride me.


666
01:01:55.930 --> 01:01:58.390
等会儿我们可以去前甲板上喝鸡尾酒
And we'll then have cocktails on foredeck.


667
01:02:17.350 --> 01:02:18.350
贝拉
Bella.


668
01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:23.390
贝拉
Bella.


669
01:02:28.100 --> 01:02:28.930
贝拉
Bella.


670
01:02:30.100 --> 01:02:30.970
贝拉
Bella!


671
01:02:31.930 --> 01:02:34.430
蓝色 蓝色 蓝色
Blue. Blue. Blue.


672
01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:14.760
敢在我身上拉屎
Shit on me?


673
01:04:15.350 --> 01:04:16.140
畜生
Fucker!


674
01:04:20.890 --> 01:04:21.810
女士
Madam.


675
01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:25.100
我们什么时候靠岸
When do we stop?


676
01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:28.470
雅典 还有三天
Athens. Three days.


677
01:04:51.010 --> 01:04:55.850
轮船

678
01:04:56.680 --> 01:04:58.970
瞧瞧 那个女人着火了
That woman's on fire, look.


679
01:05:02.010 --> 01:05:03.220
我知道你在生我的气
I know you're upset with me.


680
01:05:03.390 --> 01:05:06.180
原谅我诱拐了你 但这都是出于爱
Forgive my kidnapping of you, but it was for love.


681
01:05:06.350 --> 01:05:08.600
这就是个浪漫的玩笑 别像个婊子似的
A romantic jape. Don't be such a cunt about it.


682
01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:12.060
-我口渴了  -当然了 亲爱的
- I want a drink. - Of course, my darling.


683
01:05:12.220 --> 01:05:15.430
这艘船很有意思 还有许多未知等着你去探索
The ship is fun, a whole world to explore.


684
01:05:16.350 --> 01:05:18.140
你爱我吗 我爱你
Do you love me? I love you.


685
01:05:19.350 --> 01:05:23.430
告诉我 我应该自我探寻些什么 才能确定到底爱不爱你
Describe the elements I should be looking for within myself to be sure.


686
01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:25.970
你能感觉到你是爱我还是不爱我
You just feel it or not.


687
01:05:26.140 --> 01:05:29.720
就像古德所说 爱毫无依据
So it is no evidence base, as God would say.


688
01:05:30.470 --> 01:05:33.100
-那要如何仅凭经验判断呢  -你他妈在说什么鬼话
- So how judge it empirically? - What the fuck are you talking about?


689
01:05:33.260 --> 01:05:34.220
你是谁
Who are you?


690
01:05:34.390 --> 01:05:37.010
你不知道香蕉是什么 你也没听说过国际象棋
You don't know what bananas are, you've never heard of chess...


691
01:05:37.180 --> 01:05:38.810
你却知道什么叫凭经验判断
and yet you know what "empirically" means.


692
01:05:38.970 --> 01:05:41.560
贝拉口渴了 我说了两遍了
Bella wants a drink. I said twice now.


693
01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:44.180
我从来没有过这样的感觉
I've never felt anything like this.


694
01:05:44.350 --> 01:05:45.760
对你来说也是这样吗
Is this true for you?


695
01:05:47.850 --> 01:05:49.510
我想 凭经验来说 是这样的
I suppose, empirically it is.


696
01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:53.560
古德温

697
01:05:53.140 --> 01:05:55.010
笔没墨了
I'm out of ink.


698
01:05:59.930 --> 01:06:01.430
那我去给你拿墨水 亲爱的
Then ink you shall have, my love.


699
01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:17.140
你好啊 有趣的老太太
Hello, interesting older lady.


700
01:06:17.310 --> 01:06:18.930
我得摸摸你的头发
I must touch your hair.


701
01:06:21.350 --> 01:06:23.060
我也注意到了你的头发
I also noticed your hair.


702
01:06:23.220 --> 01:06:27.220
像丝绸披在晶莹透亮 闪闪发光的鸡蛋上一样
Just like silk on a translucent, glowing egg.


703
01:06:27.720 --> 01:06:30.260
这样花哨的辞藻让我莫名有些兴奋
That is fancy words that excite me somehow.


704
01:06:30.430 --> 01:06:33.260
我看见你和那边的帅哥在一起
I saw you're with handsome over there.


705
01:06:33.430 --> 01:06:35.560
洁白的牙齿和梆硬的老二
White teeth and a hard cock.


706
01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:38.100
邓肯·维德伯恩
Duncan Wedderburn.


707
01:06:38.260 --> 01:06:41.600
他的牙齿很硬 他的鸡鸡也很白
His teeth are also hard. His penis is also white.


708
01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:43.720
-希望他有好活  -他是我的唯一
- Good lay, I hope. - He is my only.


709
01:06:43.890 --> 01:06:48.220
但我发现他会引起我全身产生异样的感觉
But I find him to elicit exceptional sensations throughout my whole body...


710
01:06:48.390 --> 01:06:50.560
这让我愉悦地尖叫
that leave me yelping happily.


711
01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:54.640
我也希望把他的身体 或者说尸体 抛进海里
I also wish to dash his body, form, cadaver, into the sea.


712
01:06:55.260 --> 01:06:56.600
这个男人也会在你身上跳来跳去吗
Is this man jumping on your body?


713
01:06:57.180 --> 01:06:58.510
不 他不会
No, he is not.


714
01:06:58.680 --> 01:07:00.680
我已经20年没和人上过床了
I haven't been bedded in 20 years.


715
01:07:00.850 --> 01:07:01.810
什么
What?


716
01:07:02.470 --> 01:07:03.640
太糟糕了
That is terrible.


717
01:07:03.810 --> 01:07:05.640
这并没有什么好担忧的
It doesn't concern me greatly.


718
01:07:06.310 --> 01:07:07.810
几十年过去了
As years have passed...


719
01:07:07.970 --> 01:07:10.600
真正让我担忧的是我的脑子
what's in between my ears is my big concern.


720
01:07:11.180 --> 01:07:13.140
而不是
What's in between my legs...


721
01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:15.720
我两腿之间的乐趣
much less so.


722
01:07:15.890 --> 01:07:18.140
绝望的合理化 玛莎
A desperate rationalization, Martha.


723
01:07:18.310 --> 01:07:20.510
噢 这是哈利·阿斯特利
Oh, this is Harry Astley.


724
01:07:20.680 --> 01:07:23.720
别把他说的话放在心上
Don't take what he says too much to heart.


725
01:07:24.180 --> 01:07:25.310
他是个愤世嫉俗的人
He's a cynic.


726
01:07:25.890 --> 01:07:26.970
女士
Madam.


727
01:07:27.470 --> 01:07:29.060
我是贝拉·巴克斯特
I am Bella Baxter.


728
01:07:30.010 --> 01:07:32.350
我不懂什么叫愤世嫉俗
I do not know what this "cynic" is.


729
01:07:32.510 --> 01:07:33.310
贝拉
Bella.


730
01:07:34.100 --> 01:07:34.930
墨水
Ink.


731
01:07:35.100 --> 01:07:39.220
邓肯·维德伯恩 我结识了新的朋友 同僚 伙伴
Duncan Wedderburn, I have made friends, colleagues, comrades.


732
01:07:39.390 --> 01:07:40.850
哈利·阿斯特利
Harry Astley.


733
01:07:41.010 --> 01:07:42.510
这是玛莎
This is Martha.


734
01:07:42.680 --> 01:07:45.810
她是我的新朋友 她都20年没被操过了
She is my new friend who has not been fucked in 20 years.


735
01:07:45.970 --> 01:07:47.560
这难道不令人惊讶吗
Is that not astonishment?


736
01:07:47.720 --> 01:07:51.180
我希望你有用手来取悦自己
I hope you use your hand between your legs to keep yourself happy.


737
01:07:51.350 --> 01:07:54.810
天哪 贝拉 你不能说这种话
Good God, Bella, you cannot speak like this.


738
01:07:54.970 --> 01:07:57.060
上流社会要举止文雅 我给忘了
Polites of society. I forgot.


739
01:07:57.220 --> 01:07:58.680
上流社会
Polite society...


740
01:07:58.850 --> 01:08:00.260
会毁了你
will destroy you.


741
01:08:00.430 --> 01:08:02.560
-是吗  -是啊 有一定的道理
- It will? - Yeah, there's some truth to that.


742
01:08:02.720 --> 01:08:04.510
看来我们都同意这一点
We all agreed on that.


743
01:08:04.680 --> 01:08:07.010
至于你问的关于我自己动手的问题
As to your enquiry on my hand.


744
01:08:07.180 --> 01:08:09.010
是的 我有时候会这么做
Occasionally, yes.


745
01:08:09.180 --> 01:08:11.430
这可让我安心多了
That is much reassuring news.


746
01:08:12.260 --> 01:08:14.760
-我们应该一起用餐  -好吧 其实
- We shall all dine together. - Well, actually...


747
01:08:15.260 --> 01:08:17.470
我们在一条船上 都没法逃走
We are all on a ship and cannot escape...


748
01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:20.720
那就让我们在这儿纵情享乐 横渡海洋环球航行吧
and there is a world to enjoy, traverse, circumnavigate.


749
01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:23.760
难道她不能交朋友吗 维德伯恩先生
Or can she not have friends, Mr. Wedderburn?


750
01:08:24.890 --> 01:08:26.010
好极了
Delighted.


751
01:08:29.140 --> 01:08:30.430
嫁给我
Marry me.


752
01:08:30.600 --> 01:08:31.430
什么
What?


753
01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:32.930
我本想把你扔在一边
I meant to throw you aside.


754
01:08:33.100 --> 01:08:35.640
几个月后再把你打发走 但现在我做不到了
A few months and send you packing, but I cannot.


755
01:08:35.810 --> 01:08:38.470
你快说你会嫁给我 从来没人能俘获我的心 除了你
Say you'll marry me. No one's ever captured my heart. You have.


756
01:08:39.890 --> 01:08:41.140
这有点难办
It is tricky...


757
01:08:41.310 --> 01:08:43.720
因为我已经和马克斯·麦克坎多斯先生订婚了
as I am engaged to Mr. Max McCandles.


758
01:08:45.010 --> 01:08:45.850
什么
What?


759
01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:49.060
有人已对我许下执子之手的诺言
My hand has taken by another.


760
01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:52.680
这个说法我以前听过 但并不明白
It is a saying I heard, but did not understand.


761
01:08:52.850 --> 01:08:56.010
结婚不是只是牵手 而是拥有彼此的一切不是吗？
You do not take just the hand, but all, do you not?


762
01:08:56.180 --> 01:08:58.760
是你逃离了他 和我一起来
You ran away with me from him.


763
01:08:58.930 --> 01:09:02.180
每次回顾以前的事 我总是很难搞清重点
A recounting of events, the point of which is elusive to me.


764
01:09:02.350 --> 01:09:03.640
你选择了我 而不是他
You chose me over him.


765
01:09:03.810 --> 01:09:05.310
只是暂时的
For now.


766
01:09:05.470 --> 01:09:06.510
只是因为好玩
For fun.


767
01:09:06.680 --> 01:09:09.350
我他妈要把你从船上扔下去
I'll fucking throw you overboard!


768
01:09:09.510 --> 01:09:12.470
那么 你到底是想娶我还是杀我
So you wish to marry me or kill me?


769
01:09:13.310 --> 01:09:15.310
-这是求婚吗  -不是
- Is that the proposal? - No.


770
01:09:31.350 --> 01:09:32.760
去赌场
Going to the casino.


771
01:09:44.140 --> 01:09:45.220
呃 没关系
That's fine.


772
01:09:45.970 --> 01:09:47.180
她还在成长
She is coming along.


773
01:09:47.350 --> 01:09:48.930
再试一次吧
Let's try again.


774
01:09:49.430 --> 01:09:52.970
大肌肉群动作技能会发展得较为缓慢
Gross motor skills will develop slowly...


775
01:09:53.430 --> 01:09:55.850
但你会进步很快的
but you will progress fast.


776
01:09:57.850 --> 01:09:58.890
费利西蒂
Felicity.


777
01:10:03.060 --> 01:10:04.060
看来没那么快
Not that fast.


778
01:10:15.890 --> 01:10:17.760
我在读爱默生的书
I am reading Emerson.


779
01:10:17.930 --> 01:10:20.350
他谈到了男人如何改善自我
He speaks about the improvement of men.


780
01:10:20.510 --> 01:10:23.600
我不知道他为什么不给女人提建议
I do not know why he does not give advice to women.


781
01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:25.350
或许他根本就不懂女人
Perhaps he does not know any.


782
01:10:26.390 --> 01:10:29.100
试试读一读歌德
Try and read Goethe.


783
01:10:29.260 --> 01:10:31.810
读哲学就是在浪费时间 贝拉
Philosophy is a waste of time, Bella.


784
01:10:31.970 --> 01:10:34.180
真的吗 你再讲讲
Really? Say more.


785
01:10:34.350 --> 01:10:36.260
不 哈利 你个笨蛋
No, no, Harry, you wretch.


786
01:10:36.430 --> 01:10:37.390
哲学是必不可缺之物
It is integral.


787
01:10:38.430 --> 01:10:41.510
人和社会都可以由此得到改善
People and society can be improved.


788
01:10:42.510 --> 01:10:46.350
改善 发展 进步 成长 是全人类共同的目标
It is the goal of all to improve, advance, progress, grow.


789
01:10:47.310 --> 01:10:49.890
我对这一点深有其感 而且我相信我的观点可以代表所有人
I know this in me, and I am sure I am indicative of all.


790
01:10:50.060 --> 01:10:54.100
相信我 你绝对是独一无二的 贝拉 各方面都是
Trust me, you are definitely unique, Bella, in all ways.


791
01:10:54.260 --> 01:10:57.810
但这种通过哲学进行的改良
But this improvement through philosophy...


792
01:10:57.970 --> 01:11:02.060
其实是人们试图逃避自己就是残暴的野兽这一事实
is people trying to run away from the fact that we are all cruel beasts.


793
01:11:02.220 --> 01:11:04.510
生来如此 死亦如此
Born that way, die that way.


794
01:11:05.560 --> 01:11:07.350
这是一种消极观点 哈利
It is a dark view of things, Harry.


795
01:11:07.510 --> 01:11:08.430
贝拉
Bella...


796
01:11:09.970 --> 01:11:11.430
去我们的船舱里
let us take the air...


797
01:11:12.970 --> 01:11:14.600
透透气吧
in our cabin.


798
01:11:15.220 --> 01:11:16.310
但这两个人还在争论不休
But these two are fighting...


799
01:11:16.470 --> 01:11:19.260
各种想法在贝拉的脑海和心里乱撞
and ideas are banging around in Bella's head and heart...


800
01:11:19.430 --> 01:11:21.060
就像暴风雨中摇晃的灯光
like lights in a storm.


801
01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:26.140
你现在老是在看书啊 贝拉
You're always reading now, Bella.


802
01:11:26.680 --> 01:11:30.220
你说话的方式不像以前那样可爱了
You're losing some of your adorable way of speaking.


803
01:11:30.390 --> 01:11:32.060
和所有人一样
I am a changingable feast...


804
01:11:32.220 --> 01:11:33.470
我是一场变幻莫测的盛宴
as are all of we.


805
01:11:33.640 --> 01:11:36.470
爱默生是这么说的 但哈利却不同意这话
Apparently according to Emerson, disagreed with by Harry.


806
01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:37.930
来啊 来啊 走吧
Come, come. Just come.


807
01:11:39.560 --> 01:11:41.220
你挡住光了
You are in my sun.


808
01:11:41.390 --> 01:11:42.850
啥
What?


809
01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:22.560
跟我来
Come.


810
01:12:24.310 --> 01:12:26.100
我正忙着买醉呢
Busy drinking heavily.


811
01:12:29.930 --> 01:12:31.930
忙着狂输呢
Busy losing heavily.


812
01:13:11.180 --> 01:13:12.760
我得去见玛莎
I must go meet Martha.


813
01:13:14.510 --> 01:13:15.760
玛莎
Martha.


814
01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:18.260
问题就是她
She is the problem.


815
01:13:18.810 --> 01:13:22.510
我要把那个喷了香水的肉块扔海里
I'll throw that perfumed bag of flesh overboard.


816
01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:24.720
你敢扔试试
I dare you.


817
01:13:35.140 --> 01:13:36.600
玛莎
Martha!


818
01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:39.060
她在哪里
Where is she?


819
01:13:39.220 --> 01:13:40.810
你在哪里
Where are you, fuck.


820
01:13:40.970 --> 01:13:42.350
她在哪里
Where is she?


821
01:13:43.310 --> 01:13:46.180
-你要去哪  -我要把她丢进海里
- Where are you going? - She's going over the side.


822
01:13:46.350 --> 01:13:47.470
哦 太神奇了
Oh, marvelous!


823
01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:49.720
我从没想过会被谋杀
I never imagined being murdered.


824
01:13:49.890 --> 01:13:50.890
太戏剧化了
How dramatic.


825
01:13:51.470 --> 01:13:54.310
她看起来乐意去死 很抱歉挡了你的路
Well, she seems happy to die. I'm sorry for getting in your way.


826
01:13:59.310 --> 01:14:01.510
有意思
Exciting.


827
01:14:19.390 --> 01:14:20.850
我在酒吧等你
I'll be in the bar.


828
01:14:54.640 --> 01:14:57.260
你让我思考 犹豫
You have made me think, cogitate...


829
01:14:58.140 --> 01:15:00.970
在错误 愚蠢 惹人烦的
perambulate on ideas that are wrong...


830
01:15:01.140 --> 01:15:04.310
思想中徘徊
erroneous and nonsensically annoying...


831
01:15:04.810 --> 01:15:06.180
我失眠了
that lead me not to sleep.


832
01:15:06.350 --> 01:15:07.470
然后呢
So...


833
01:15:09.350 --> 01:15:11.470
你说人都是残忍的
You say all are cruel.


834
01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:14.220
我否定 拒绝
And I disagree, disavow...


835
01:15:14.390 --> 01:15:15.430
表示不是这样的
and say no not.


836
01:15:16.680 --> 01:15:18.680
但是在邓肯面前
But when with Duncan...


837
01:15:18.850 --> 01:15:21.390
我心中的残忍开始冒泡
the cruel just bubbles up in me.


838
01:15:21.810 --> 01:15:23.310
说明你有自己的判断力
That shows good judgment.


839
01:15:24.310 --> 01:15:25.810
他是个十足的蠢货
He is a pretty moron.


840
01:15:25.970 --> 01:15:26.930
不
No.


841
01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:29.220
我不想残忍
I do not wish to be cruel.


842
01:15:30.310 --> 01:15:33.060
我必须改进自己这一面
I must improve this aspect of myself.


843
01:15:33.220 --> 01:15:34.760
你不了解全世界
You don't know the world.


844
01:15:35.350 --> 01:15:36.430
你有恐惧
And you fear it.


845
01:15:38.850 --> 01:15:40.430
我不恐惧
I do not fear it.


846
01:15:40.850 --> 01:15:43.010
你想看看这个世界真实的样子吗
Do you want to see what the world is really like?


847
01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:44.470
我带你看
I'll show you.


848
01:15:45.220 --> 01:15:46.140
好
Yes.


849
01:15:46.850 --> 01:15:47.850
好
Of course.


850
01:16:22.350 --> 01:16:26.430
亚历山大

851
01:16:34.720 --> 01:16:35.720
你听见了吗
Do you hear that?


852
01:16:39.350 --> 01:16:40.350
那是什么
What is it?


853
01:17:01.760 --> 01:17:03.260
-很多死婴  -噢
Lot of dead babies.


854
01:17:04.260 --> 01:17:05.470
那里一定很热吧
Must be hot.


855
01:17:07.220 --> 01:17:08.640
我们得去帮帮他们
We must go help them.


856
01:17:09.720 --> 01:17:11.060
怎么帮
How will we do that?


857
01:17:13.930 --> 01:17:15.220
我们一下去
We go down there...


858
01:17:15.390 --> 01:17:18.890
他们会理所当然的把我们绑上抢 劫强 奸我们
they'll quite rightfully rope us, rob us, and rape us.


859
01:17:19.060 --> 01:17:21.220
如果换个位置 他们在这里 我们在下面
And if they were here and we were there...


860
01:17:21.850 --> 01:17:23.220
我们也会这么做
we'd do the same to them.


861
01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:28.560
贝拉
Bella.


862
01:17:29.640 --> 01:17:30.600
贝拉
Bella.


863
01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:32.560
贝拉
Bella.


864
01:19:15.060 --> 01:19:16.350
船要开走了 女士
We are casting off, ma'am.


865
01:19:16.850 --> 01:19:18.350
我得回去
But I have to go back.


866
01:19:19.430 --> 01:19:23.220
我得把钱分给旅馆附近的穷人
I must give this money to the poor near the hotel...


867
01:19:23.390 --> 01:19:24.930
也就是他们说的贫民窟里的人
in what they call a slum.


868
01:19:26.180 --> 01:19:27.600
我们会留在岸上 女士
We're staying ashore, ma'am.


869
01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:30.010
我们可以帮您办这件事
We could take care of that for you.


870
01:19:30.720 --> 01:19:31.560
你们可以吗
You can?


871
01:19:31.760 --> 01:19:32.760
当然
Of course.


872
01:19:33.140 --> 01:19:34.720
您很大方
It is generous of you.


873
01:19:35.310 --> 01:19:36.390
他们需要钱
They need money.


874
01:19:36.890 --> 01:19:38.100
谁都需要钱
Everyone does.


875
01:19:43.760 --> 01:19:44.810
谢谢你
Thank you.


876
01:20:01.970 --> 01:20:05.390
你 把船长叫过来 一定要找到那个该死的小偷
You! Get me the captain. Now we'll find this fucking thief.


877
01:20:05.560 --> 01:20:06.390
贝拉
Bella!


878
01:20:08.220 --> 01:20:09.260
我们被抢劫了
We've been robbed!


879
01:20:10.140 --> 01:20:11.390
我赢了
I won.


880
01:20:11.560 --> 01:20:13.010
我赢得了所有东西
I won everything...


881
01:20:13.180 --> 01:20:14.640
以前从来没有过
like never before.


882
01:20:14.810 --> 01:20:16.970
现在 都没了
And now it's gone.


883
01:20:17.140 --> 01:20:18.850
没人抢你东西
You've not been robbed.


884
01:20:19.010 --> 01:20:20.850
-我拿走了  -为什么
- I took it. - For what?


885
01:20:21.430 --> 01:20:22.470
我拿走了
I took it.


886
01:20:24.390 --> 01:20:25.680
我太累了
I'm so tired.


887
01:20:27.680 --> 01:20:30.010
或者也许只是我的炅魂如此
Or maybe just my spirit is.


888
01:20:30.890 --> 01:20:33.510
我的灵魂被钳制 蹂躏
My soul has been buckled, crumpled...


889
01:20:33.720 --> 01:20:36.510
打压 邓肯·维德伯恩
flattened, Duncan Wedderburn...


890
01:20:37.310 --> 01:20:38.890
被我看到的东西折磨
by the sights I have seen.


891
01:20:42.060 --> 01:20:43.440
所以 不需要找船长了 是吧先生
So, no need for the captain then, sir?


892
01:20:43.440 --> 01:20:45.720
滚开 别让我把你们打得满地找牙
Fuck off before I break all your teeth.


893
01:20:46.970 --> 01:20:48.140
好的 先生
Indeed, sir.


894
01:20:51.810 --> 01:20:52.850
放哪里了
Where is it?


895
01:20:53.600 --> 01:20:55.140
你是安全起见藏起来了
You hid it for safety.


896
01:20:55.310 --> 01:20:58.680
我喝醉了 还愚蠢地扔得到处都是 这就让人放心了
I was drunk and foolishly left it everywhere. What a relief.


897
01:20:59.350 --> 01:21:01.100
我没有藏起来
I did not hide it.


898
01:21:01.890 --> 01:21:05.260
我把它给外面的穷人了
I gave it to those poor people out there.


899
01:21:05.850 --> 01:21:08.970
金钱本身就是一种疾病
Money is its own form of sickness...


900
01:21:09.510 --> 01:21:11.180
也代表了一种贫瘠
and all the scarcity of it.


901
01:21:12.600 --> 01:21:14.100
我又凭什么
And who am I...


902
01:21:14.810 --> 01:21:16.760
躺在羽毛床中
lying in a feather bed...


903
01:21:17.970 --> 01:21:19.510
同时 却有婴儿们
while dead babies...


904
01:21:20.010 --> 01:21:21.470
在沟渠中死去
lie in a ditch?


905
01:21:23.430 --> 01:21:24.470
邓肯
Duncan.


906
01:21:26.220 --> 01:21:28.060
你干了什么
You what?


907
01:21:29.680 --> 01:21:32.720
我想要一个安慰的拥抱
I am expecting a hug of solace.


908
01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:34.430
你
You...


909
01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:37.220
我需要给这个世界奉献一些东西
I need to offer something to the world.


910
01:21:38.180 --> 01:21:39.680
但目前我什么都没有
And yet I have nothing.


911
01:21:40.970 --> 01:21:42.180
除了一些钱
Except some money.


912
01:21:44.140 --> 01:21:46.930
贝拉·巴克斯特今天过得很不好
It is a bad day for Bella Baxter.


913
01:21:48.010 --> 01:21:51.310
我的钱他妈在哪
Where is my fucking money?


914
01:21:51.470 --> 01:21:52.600
我刚才告诉你了
I just told you.


915
01:21:52.810 --> 01:21:55.510
我把它给穷人了
I gave it away to the poor.


916
01:21:56.970 --> 01:21:59.220
我不是刚才告诉你滚出去了吗
I thought I told you to fuck off!


917
01:22:00.560 --> 01:22:01.810
乘务通知我
The steward informs me...


918
01:22:01.970 --> 01:22:04.850
说您的资金可能不足 无法清偿您的账户 先生
that you may not have sufficient funds to make good your account, sir.


919
01:22:05.510 --> 01:22:07.260
-这个 我  -这估计是真的
- Well, I... - That is probably true.


920
01:22:08.140 --> 01:22:10.100
我把你的钱交给几位好人
I gave it all to some nice men...


921
01:22:11.140 --> 01:22:12.470
他们把钱给
to pass on...


922
01:22:12.970 --> 01:22:14.430
那些贫民窟穷人
to the slum poor.


923
01:22:15.060 --> 01:22:17.220
你们会在下一个港口下船
You'll be put ashore at the next port...


924
01:22:17.390 --> 01:22:19.510
到那之前都只能拥有船员配给 先生
and confined to crew's rations until then, sir.


925
01:22:19.680 --> 01:22:21.560
-晚安  -你怎么敢
- Good evening. - How dare you?


926
01:22:32.720 --> 01:22:36.180
死去的 盲人婴儿
"Dead, blind babies...


927
01:22:37.640 --> 01:22:38.970
咬了哈利
"bit Harry.


928
01:22:40.810 --> 01:22:42.470
我的嘴
"My mouth...


929
01:22:42.640 --> 01:22:46.060
满是鲜血
"was full of blood."


930
01:22:47.390 --> 01:22:48.510
可怜的贝拉
Poor Bella.


931
01:22:50.350 --> 01:22:51.560
狼狈不堪
She is a ruin.


932
01:22:56.810 --> 01:22:58.560
-你的手怎么样了  -没事了
- How's your hand? - It's fine.


933
01:22:59.100 --> 01:23:00.140
对不起
I'm sorry.


934
01:23:00.310 --> 01:23:02.010
你只是在帮助我理解
You were trying to help me understand.


935
01:23:02.180 --> 01:23:04.720
不我 其实想要伤害你
No. I actually wanted to hurt you.


936
01:23:05.930 --> 01:23:09.970
不能忍受看到一个人拥有傻傻但美好的快乐
Couldn't bear to see such dumb, beautiful happiness in someone.


937
01:23:10.470 --> 01:23:11.720
我很残忍
It was cruel of me.


938
01:23:12.390 --> 01:23:13.560
我不抱歉
I am not sorry.


939
01:23:14.430 --> 01:23:16.260
如果我了解这个世界 我可以让它变得更好
If I know the world, I can improve it.


940
01:23:16.430 --> 01:23:17.560
你不能
You can't.


941
01:23:18.060 --> 01:23:19.470
这才是真正的关键点
That is the real point.


942
01:23:20.100 --> 01:23:21.810
不要相信宗教的谎言
Don't accept the lie of religion...


943
01:23:21.970 --> 01:23:22.810
社会主义
socialism...


944
01:23:23.350 --> 01:23:24.430
资本主义
capitalism.


945
01:23:24.890 --> 01:23:26.470
人类已经完蛋了
We are a fucked species.


946
01:23:26.720 --> 01:23:28.930
你得知道 希望是会破碎的
Know it. Hope is smashable.


947
01:23:29.100 --> 01:23:30.310
但现实主义不会
Realism is not.


948
01:23:30.810 --> 01:23:32.510
用真相保护自己
Protect yourself with the truth.


949
01:23:34.310 --> 01:23:36.430
我知道你现在是什么了 哈利
I realize what you are now, Harry.


950
01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:39.680
一个受伤的小男孩不能承受世界带来的伤痛
Just a broken little boy who cannot bear the pain of the world.


951
01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:42.720
我也觉得
I suppose so.


952
01:23:51.930 --> 01:23:53.100
再见了 哈利
Goodbye, Harry.


953
01:23:53.310 --> 01:23:54.970
我们得在马赛下船了
We get thrown off in Marseille.


954
01:23:55.810 --> 01:23:57.310
那你为什么还跟他在一起
Why do you stay with him?


955
01:23:57.890 --> 01:23:59.390
我一直觉得这样会更好
I always think it will be better.


956
01:24:01.310 --> 01:24:02.430
当然了
'Course you do.


957
01:24:12.970 --> 01:24:18.890
巴黎

958
01:24:18.890 --> 01:24:21.560
我听说过巴黎的美景
I have heard great things of the beauty of Paris.


959
01:24:24.810 --> 01:24:27.470
我会他妈的把你的狗踢死
I'll fucking kick your dog to death.


960
01:24:30.890 --> 01:24:31.890
他妈的
Fucking...


961
01:24:32.430 --> 01:24:34.060
我们在巴黎身无分文
Paris with no money.


962
01:24:34.510 --> 01:24:37.430
-你有什么好建议 贝拉  -我会找到旅馆的
- What do you suggest we do, Bella? - I will get us a hotel.


963
01:24:37.600 --> 01:24:38.640
别担心
Do not worry.


964
01:24:39.260 --> 01:24:40.850
啊哈 用什么找 我们可没钱
With what? We have no money.


965
01:24:42.720 --> 01:24:45.310
这难道不是一场有趣的实验吗
Is it not an interesting experiment?


966
01:24:45.470 --> 01:24:46.390
我们一无所有
We have nothing.


967
01:24:47.010 --> 01:24:48.890
-我们现在应该怎么生存  -我不知道
- How will we live now? - I don't know!


968
01:24:49.060 --> 01:24:50.970
没错 这就是一场实验
Exactly, that is the experiment.


969
01:24:51.390 --> 01:24:52.600
我们现在就是穷人
We are now the poor.


970
01:24:53.810 --> 01:24:56.180
而且 很多探险家也遇见过这些困难
Also, many adventurers have faced these odds.


971
01:24:56.760 --> 01:24:58.140
比如 鲁滨逊·克鲁索
Robinson Crusoe, for example.


972
01:24:58.680 --> 01:25:01.260
自私自利没心没肺 粗心大意的贱人
Selfish, thoughtless, careless bitch.


973
01:25:01.510 --> 01:25:03.680
我不是没心没肺 邓肯
I'm not thoughtless, Duncan.


974
01:25:04.310 --> 01:25:05.720
虽然我的
And while it is true my ability...


975
01:25:05.890 --> 01:25:08.970
逻辑思维能力
to think things through to the logical conclusions is not...


976
01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:10.760
确实不强
strong...


977
01:25:11.180 --> 01:25:13.220
我的确帮助了那些受苦受难的人
I did help those suffering people.


978
01:25:13.640 --> 01:25:14.640
我害了我们
I have ruined us...


979
01:25:15.060 --> 01:25:16.310
如你所说
as you pointed out...


980
01:25:16.850 --> 01:25:19.140
但我相信我的初心是好的
but I do believe my actions come from a good place.


981
01:25:19.310 --> 01:25:21.390
快他妈闭嘴吧
Shut the fuck up.


982
01:25:22.260 --> 01:25:23.640
我会让我们住进旅馆的
I will get us a hotel.


983
01:25:28.970 --> 01:25:30.390
下午好 夫人
Good afternoon, madam.


984
01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:33.720
你好 这位美丽可人的英伦玫瑰
Good day, my fresh, darling English Rose.


985
01:25:34.680 --> 01:25:35.720
这是一家旅馆吗
Is this a hotel?


986
01:25:35.930 --> 01:25:37.010
我们还有房间
We have rooms.


987
01:25:37.510 --> 01:25:38.720
你是想找份工作吗
Are you looking for work?


988
01:25:38.890 --> 01:25:39.930
一间房间多少钱
How much is a room?


989
01:25:40.100 --> 01:25:42.180
我就收你十法郎一小时好了
I'll charge you 10 francs an hour.


990
01:25:42.350 --> 01:25:44.390
你收他们三十
You charge them 30.


991
01:25:44.560 --> 01:25:45.680
大家都开心
Everyone's happy.


992
01:25:46.310 --> 01:25:47.310
我知道了
I see.


993
01:25:47.810 --> 01:25:49.220
沙佩勒先生
Monsieur Chapelle.


994
01:25:49.390 --> 01:25:50.390
这位是新来的伦敦人
Fresh from London.


995
01:25:52.390 --> 01:25:53.390
你好
Hello.


996
01:25:59.140 --> 01:26:00.350
好了 你进去吧
So, off you go.


997
01:26:00.810 --> 01:26:02.350
现在 我有点困惑
At this point, I am confused.


998
01:26:02.510 --> 01:26:04.140
你不是来这工作的吗
You're not here to work?


999
01:26:04.310 --> 01:26:05.510
你就去吧
Come on.


1000
01:26:05.680 --> 01:26:08.140
跟他上床 让他进入你的身体
Lie with him, let him cock you a bit...


1001
01:26:08.310 --> 01:26:09.680
赚点小钱
and make some nice francs.


1002
01:26:09.850 --> 01:26:10.680
我知道了
I see.


1003
01:26:11.680 --> 01:26:12.970
他会给我钱吗
He would pay me for this?


1004
01:26:13.470 --> 01:26:14.470
会
Yes.


1005
01:26:15.010 --> 01:26:16.470
如果你缺钱
If you need money...


1006
01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:18.720
这就是最短的捷径
it is the shortest route to it.


1007
01:26:19.720 --> 01:26:22.600
还没有别的男人进入过我的身体
I have never been cocked by another man...


1008
01:26:23.260 --> 01:26:24.720
但是现在有点想了
and yet have wondered on that.


1009
01:26:25.640 --> 01:26:27.060
而且我缺钱
And am in need of funds.


1010
01:26:28.470 --> 01:26:31.930
我认为 这是多种情况交织在一起导致的结果
It is, I believe, a confluence of circumstances...


1011
01:26:32.100 --> 01:26:34.100
有点像是命运使然
I regard as almost fate-like.


1012
01:26:34.560 --> 01:26:35.890
那就开干吧
Let us do this.


1013
01:26:38.560 --> 01:26:39.810
十六号房间
Room 16.


1014
01:27:17.510 --> 01:27:18.640
你叫什么名字
What is your name?


1015
01:27:26.680 --> 01:27:27.850
真神秘
Mysterious.


1016
01:27:55.600 --> 01:27:57.220
我们需要前戏一下吗
Should we warm me up a bit...


1017
01:28:30.310 --> 01:28:31.140
你好 先生
Good day, sir.


1018
01:28:31.600 --> 01:28:33.060
吃巧克力闪电泡芙吗
Éclair au chocolat?


1019
01:28:34.430 --> 01:28:36.970
我得到了钱 还得到了一些启发
I've come into some money and some enlightenment.


1020
01:28:37.850 --> 01:28:38.890
你偷来的吗
You stole it?


1021
01:28:39.310 --> 01:28:42.100
你总是说 你床上功夫世界第一
You've always said you're the best bedman in the world...


1022
01:28:42.310 --> 01:28:46.100
我也从不知道其他人怎么样 所以我也不知道这是不是真的
and I have never known another, so I knew not whether this was true.


1023
01:28:46.640 --> 01:28:47.850
但是现在我知道了
But now I do.


1024
01:28:48.470 --> 01:28:49.720
他简直糟糕透顶
And he was terrible...


1025
01:28:50.180 --> 01:28:53.310
他冲进我身体的时候 还发出了可怕的声音
and made ungodly noises as he thrust himself into me.


1026
01:28:53.470 --> 01:28:57.010
他仅仅猛冲了三次 邓肯·维德伯恩 三次已经是他的极限了
And a mere three thrusts, Duncan Wedderburn, was all he could manage.


1027
01:28:57.220 --> 01:28:58.640
我没忍住 笑了一声
I stifled a laugh...


1028
01:28:58.810 --> 01:29:00.640
当然 是出于礼貌
out of polites, of course.


1029
01:29:00.810 --> 01:29:02.850
接受了他给的钱 对他表示了感谢
I took his money. I thanked him.


1030
01:29:03.010 --> 01:29:05.430
我一路笑着去买了这些闪电泡芙
I laughed all the way to buy us these eclairs...


1031
01:29:05.600 --> 01:29:06.720
也一路深情地回忆
and I thought so fondly...


1032
01:29:07.600 --> 01:29:10.220
我们两个度过的一个个大汗淋漓的激烈夜晚
remembering the fierce sweaty nights of ours.


1033
01:29:11.810 --> 01:29:13.430
你为了钱和别人上床
You fucked for money?


1034
01:29:13.600 --> 01:29:15.140
这是一种实验
And as an experiment.


1035
01:29:15.970 --> 01:29:20.060
而且对我们的关系也有好处 让我对你更加倾心
And it is good for our relationship as it gladdens my heart toward you.


1036
01:29:20.220 --> 01:29:23.930
你最近总是哭哭啼啼 骂骂咧咧 我对你感情略有暗淡
My heart has been a bit dim on your weepy, sweary person lately.


1037
01:29:25.760 --> 01:29:28.310
你是个怪物 一个妓女 一个怪物
You are a monster. A whore and a monster.


1038
01:29:28.470 --> 01:29:29.930
你是来自地狱的恶魔
A demon sent from hell...


1039
01:29:30.140 --> 01:29:31.680
把我的灵魂撕裂
to rip my spirit to shreds.


1040
01:29:31.850 --> 01:29:34.600
你竟敢用海啸般的毁灭
To punish my tiny sins...


1041
01:29:34.760 --> 01:29:36.430
来惩罚我如此微小的罪孽
with a tsunami of destruction.


1042
01:29:36.600 --> 01:29:38.390
把我的心撕来扯去
To take my heart and pull it like taffy...


1043
01:29:38.560 --> 01:29:39.390
毁灭我
to ruin me.


1044
01:29:39.560 --> 01:29:41.470
我在你的脸上只能看到丑陋
I look at you, and I see nothing but ugliness.


1045
01:29:42.970 --> 01:29:45.930
最后那句话完全没有必要 也没有意义
That last bit was uncalled for and makes no sense...


1046
01:29:46.100 --> 01:29:48.720
因为你对我美貌的赞美实在是无趣
as your odes to my beauty have been boring...


1047
01:29:48.890 --> 01:29:49.930
但却从未停止
but constant.


1048
01:29:50.510 --> 01:29:52.760
仅仅是因为
And the simple act...


1049
01:29:52.930 --> 01:29:55.390
一个陌生男子与我同床
of letting a strange man ride on me...


1050
01:29:55.560 --> 01:29:56.600
你就抹去了所有的赞美
has erased all that?


1051
01:29:58.930 --> 01:29:59.930
妈的
Fuck!


1052
01:30:00.100 --> 01:30:02.180
你成了妓女
You whored yourself.


1053
01:30:02.680 --> 01:30:04.930
你现在又要给我解释这件事的弊端了
Which you are now going to explain to me is bad.


1054
01:30:05.310 --> 01:30:06.510
我做什么都不能让你满意吗
Can I never win with you?


1055
01:30:06.680 --> 01:30:09.390
这是一个女人最底线的行为了
It is the worst thing women can do.


1056
01:30:10.810 --> 01:30:12.600
我们肯定不能结婚了
We should definitely never marry.


1057
01:30:13.470 --> 01:30:15.720
我是个满是缺陷 却乐于尝试的人
I am a flawed, experimenting person...


1058
01:30:15.890 --> 01:30:18.680
我需要一个更能谅解我的丈夫
and I will need a husband with a more forgiving disposition.


1059
01:30:19.310 --> 01:30:20.640
你这婊子
Cunt!


1060
01:30:20.810 --> 01:30:22.390
我现在看出来 你并不符合我的要求
I can now see you are not that.


1061
01:30:23.220 --> 01:30:24.640
我们的冒险之旅也该结束了
Our adventure is clearly over.


1062
01:30:25.260 --> 01:30:27.260
我给你订一张回伦敦的船票
I shall book you a passage back to London.


1063
01:30:27.720 --> 01:30:29.140
原来你身上
You had money...


1064
01:30:29.850 --> 01:30:30.890
其实一直都有钱吗
this whole time?


1065
01:30:31.060 --> 01:30:32.310
是古德的钱
It is God's money.


1066
01:30:33.350 --> 01:30:34.390
来应对突发事件
For emergencies.


1067
01:30:34.560 --> 01:30:36.890
突发事件已经持续他妈的好几周了
It has been a fucking emergency for weeks now!


1068
01:30:37.060 --> 01:30:38.850
我始终都相信
I believed in you the whole time...


1069
01:30:39.350 --> 01:30:40.970
你能迎难而上
that you would rise to the occasion.


1070
01:30:41.430 --> 01:30:44.720
但我错了 很显然 你的内心已经破裂了
But now I see that was a mistake, and there's clearly something broken in you.


1071
01:30:44.890 --> 01:30:47.100
我的内心都是被你破裂的
You broke that something in me!


1072
01:30:47.260 --> 01:30:49.470
我觉得这个对话只是在绕圈子
I feel this conversation has become circular.


1073
01:30:49.640 --> 01:30:52.060
婊子
Cunt!


1074
01:30:58.260 --> 01:31:00.600
斯瓦尼夫人 我考量了我的处境
Madam Swiney, I have examined my situation.


1075
01:31:00.760 --> 01:31:02.350
我需要性交和钱
I need sex and money.


1076
01:31:02.850 --> 01:31:04.060
我需要一个爱人
I could take a lover...


1077
01:31:04.220 --> 01:31:05.970
又一个像维德伯恩那样供养我的人
another Wedderburn who would keep me...


1078
01:31:06.140 --> 01:31:08.220
但那人必定要对我投入大量的关注
but may require an awful lot of attention.


1079
01:31:08.390 --> 01:31:10.100
或是一个只需陪伴二十分钟的爱人
Or else it's 20 minutes at a time...


1080
01:31:10.260 --> 01:31:12.390
这样我每天的剩余时间就可以好好研究这个世界
and the rest of my day is free to study on the world...


1081
01:31:12.560 --> 01:31:13.720
研究如何让这个世界变好
and the improvement of it.


1082
01:31:14.260 --> 01:31:16.600
因此我来到你这里
Hence, I seek employment...


1083
01:31:16.760 --> 01:31:19.680
这个霉味萦绕的处所求取一份工作 换取一份通奸的美好时光
at your musty-smelling establishment of good-time fornication.


1084
01:31:19.850 --> 01:31:22.810
一个规划自由之路的女人
A woman plotting her course to freedom.


1085
01:31:23.560 --> 01:31:25.010
真是讨人喜欢
How delightful.


1086
01:31:25.810 --> 01:31:26.810
跟我来
Come.


1087
01:31:30.350 --> 01:31:32.560
啊 是美味先生来了
Monsieur Saveur.


1088
01:31:34.310 --> 01:31:35.350
一块牛里脊
A filet mignon.


1089
01:31:35.930 --> 01:31:37.890
上等的牛肉
A prime cut.


1090
01:31:50.890 --> 01:31:52.180
她叫贝拉
Bella.


1091
01:31:53.970 --> 01:31:55.560
办完事说 了不起
Say "formidable" at the end.


1092
01:31:55.720 --> 01:31:56.680
是这里的规矩
House rules.


1093
01:32:25.640 --> 01:32:27.180
那是你身上的味道吗
Is that smell you?


1094
01:33:01.970 --> 01:33:03.100
了不起
Formidable.


1095
01:33:16.010 --> 01:33:17.180
去异味的
For the smell.


1096
01:33:18.140 --> 01:33:20.140
还有茶 不过只是因为这茶好喝
And tea. Just because tea is nice.


1097
01:33:24.220 --> 01:33:25.430
过程很粗暴
It was brutal...


1098
01:33:25.930 --> 01:33:27.430
但奇怪的是并不让我讨厌
in a strangely not unpleasant way.


1099
01:33:31.510 --> 01:33:32.560
拿着这个小册子
Pamphlet.


1100
01:33:33.850 --> 01:33:35.010
-读一读  -这是写什么的
- Read. - What is that?


1101
01:33:35.180 --> 01:33:37.850
一位想要改变世界的人
Une personne qui veut... change the world pour le meilleur.


1102
01:33:38.010 --> 01:33:39.890
让世界变得更好 变成美好的世界
Make it better. A better world.


1103
01:33:40.930 --> 01:33:42.680
我也是那样的人
Then I am that too.


1104
01:33:53.760 --> 01:33:54.640
斯瓦尼夫人
Madam Swiney...


1105
01:33:55.010 --> 01:33:56.720
我们这样一字排开等人挑选
this lineup system...


1106
01:33:56.890 --> 01:34:00.510
你不会真指望我去和一位我甚至都讨厌的男人上楼
you really expect me to go upstairs with a man even if I find him distasteful...


1107
01:34:00.680 --> 01:34:02.720
等他粗鲁地在我身上激烈跳跃后
and therefore am sad...


1108
01:34:02.890 --> 01:34:04.350
我为此感到难过吧
when I let him furious jump me?


1109
01:34:04.510 --> 01:34:06.930
规矩就是这样 亲爱的
That is the way it is, my darling.


1110
01:34:10.010 --> 01:34:11.470
天呐 你很漂亮
Gosh, you look pretty.


1111
01:34:11.640 --> 01:34:13.810
想想你是怎么接受被人蹂躏的
How it agrees with you to be ravaged.


1112
01:34:14.680 --> 01:34:15.720
倒是这样
I suppose so.


1113
01:34:20.600 --> 01:34:22.970
那么 你难道只顾自己喜好
So, would you not prefer it if the women chose...


1114
01:34:23.390 --> 01:34:25.930
而不愿意让女人来做选择吗
as it would be a sign of enthusiasm toward you?


1115
01:34:26.810 --> 01:34:29.390
你丝毫不会察觉到你在她们身上激烈跳跃后
You wouldn't have the vague sense that they are in a state of horror...


1116
01:34:29.560 --> 01:34:30.600
她们会感到害怕吗
when you jump them.


1117
01:34:34.850 --> 01:34:37.430
贝拉是新来这里的 可能脑子有点问题
Bella is new and may have a mental illness.


1118
01:34:41.510 --> 01:34:43.060
就像古德 我父亲说的那样
As God, my father, says...


1119
01:34:43.390 --> 01:34:46.100
新事物会代替现在的旧事物
it is only the way it is until we discover the new way it is...


1120
01:34:46.260 --> 01:34:48.970
然后更新的事物又会替代这之前的事物
and then that is the way it is until we discover the new way it is...


1121
01:34:49.140 --> 01:34:51.220
一直发展到这个世界不再单调
and so it goes until the world is no longer flat...


1122
01:34:51.390 --> 01:34:54.470
电力的出现照亮了夜空 鞋子也不再需要系带
electricity lights the night, and shoes are no longer tied with ribbons.


1123
01:34:55.680 --> 01:34:57.390
作为一名社会主义者 我完全同意你说的话
As a socialist, I agree entirely.


1124
01:34:58.510 --> 01:35:01.010
托妮特 你可真是长了张巧嘴
Toinette, you have such a clever mouth.


1125
01:35:01.560 --> 01:35:04.430
梅尔索先生可以去免费享受了
Monsieur Mersault will enjoy it for free.


1126
01:35:04.970 --> 01:35:06.560
现在就去
Go. Now.


1127
01:35:07.260 --> 01:35:09.720
贝拉 来一下我办公室
Bella, a moment in my office.


1128
01:35:11.810 --> 01:35:14.510
你的耳垂真是秀色可餐
You have the most delicious looking lobes.


1129
01:35:15.600 --> 01:35:16.510
谢谢
Thank you.


1130
01:35:16.680 --> 01:35:17.680
我必须
I must...


1131
01:35:21.470 --> 01:35:23.430
真是抱歉 我咬出血了
Oh, I am sorry. I drew blood.


1132
01:35:24.260 --> 01:35:25.350
给你
Here.


1133
01:35:27.890 --> 01:35:32.180
有时候我看到年轻漂亮的女孩 会放纵自己一下
I sometimes give in to myself when I see beauty, young beauty.


1134
01:35:32.350 --> 01:35:33.850
终将有一天 亲爱的
For one day, my dear...


1135
01:35:34.010 --> 01:35:37.010
你会变成一个满脸皱纹的老妇人
you will be a wrinkled, old husk.


1136
01:35:37.180 --> 01:35:41.600
到时候不论是花钱还是免费 都不会有人想要你
And no one will want you either to pay you for it or to have it for free.


1137
01:35:42.260 --> 01:35:44.930
我还是相信有选择权的人才会更快乐
I still believe everyone would be happier if we could choose.


1138
01:35:45.100 --> 01:35:46.560
你是个理想主义者
An idealist.


1139
01:35:46.720 --> 01:35:47.890
跟我一样
Like me.


1140
01:35:48.510 --> 01:35:50.810
多么讨人喜欢啊
How delightful you are.


1141
01:35:50.970 --> 01:35:55.220
但我们有时候也要向外界低头
But we must give in to the demands of the world sometimes.


1142
01:35:55.390 --> 01:35:57.100
努力应对困难 击败困难
Grapple with it, try to defeat it.


1143
01:35:57.260 --> 01:35:59.560
-所以你也相信我说的话吗  -当然
- So you believe as me? - Of course.


1144
01:35:59.720 --> 01:36:03.850
但有些男人就是享受和你做的时候你满脸不乐意
But some men enjoy that you do not like it.


1145
01:36:04.010 --> 01:36:04.890
什么
What?


1146
01:36:06.600 --> 01:36:07.680
那可真变态
- That is... - Sick.


1147
01:36:07.850 --> 01:36:09.640
但也是好商机
But good business.


1148
01:36:10.260 --> 01:36:11.510
跟我来
Come with me.


1149
01:36:16.510 --> 01:36:17.930
这是我的外孙女
My grandchild.


1150
01:36:18.720 --> 01:36:22.010
体弱多病 需要不停看病
Sick and poorly, and requiring much doctoring.


1151
01:36:22.180 --> 01:36:26.850
我要是给了你选择的权利 不但会殃及到我的生意
My choice of giving you choice will jeopardize the business.


1152
01:36:27.010 --> 01:36:28.640
还会危及到她的健康和性命
Her health. Her life.


1153
01:36:28.810 --> 01:36:31.180
-这是你想要的吗 贝拉  -当然不是
- Do you want that, Bella? - Of course not.


1154
01:36:31.350 --> 01:36:33.140
你真不想 你可太善良了
You don't? You're so lovely.


1155
01:36:35.260 --> 01:36:36.970
我还以为你又要咬我耳垂了
I thought you were going for my lobes.


1156
01:36:38.850 --> 01:36:40.180
我们必须去工作
We must work.


1157
01:36:41.010 --> 01:36:43.310
我们必须去赚钱
We must make money.


1158
01:36:43.470 --> 01:36:46.810
但除了这些 我们还必须去经历人生百味
But more than that, we must experience everything...


1159
01:36:46.970 --> 01:36:48.180
不只是好事
not just the good.


1160
01:36:48.350 --> 01:36:51.510
还有那些落魄 恐惧 悲伤
But degradation, horror, sadness...


1161
01:36:51.680 --> 01:36:54.140
这样我们才能完整 贝拉
This makes us whole, Bella.


1162
01:36:54.310 --> 01:36:56.430
这样我们才是有血有肉的人
Makes us people of substance...


1163
01:36:56.600 --> 01:36:58.890
不是轻狂天真 未被世俗沾染的孩子
not flighty, untouched children.


1164
01:37:00.260 --> 01:37:02.010
这样之后 才能了解世界
Then we can know the world.


1165
01:37:03.100 --> 01:37:05.140
而当我们了解了世界
And when we know the world...


1166
01:37:05.310 --> 01:37:07.390
世界便是我们的
the world is ours.


1167
01:37:08.430 --> 01:37:09.560
我想要这样
I want that.


1168
01:37:10.220 --> 01:37:11.680
这样的话
Now...


1169
01:37:11.850 --> 01:37:13.640
就去和别人上床
go and fuck someone...


1170
01:37:13.810 --> 01:37:16.640
然后带回来十法郎给我
and bring me 10 francs.


1171
01:37:20.430 --> 01:37:22.810
首先 我提议做一个小测验
First, I suggest a short quiz.


1172
01:37:23.640 --> 01:37:24.510
什么小测验
A quiz?


1173
01:37:25.310 --> 01:37:27.100
你给我讲一段童年的回忆
You tell me a childhood memory.


1174
01:37:29.930 --> 01:37:31.510
然后我给你讲一个笑话 敲敲
Then I tell a joke.


1175
01:37:32.810 --> 01:37:34.430
然后快快地闻一下薰衣草油
Then a quick sniff...


1176
01:37:34.600 --> 01:37:37.760
如果需要的话 再用它快速浸泡一下
and if necessary, a quick douse in lavender oil.


1177
01:37:37.930 --> 01:37:42.510
这些东西都会增强体验 让它变得妙极了
And all of this will enhance the experience making it formidable.


1178
01:37:45.720 --> 01:37:47.560
不 讲笑话是我来
Non, I tell the joke.


1179
01:37:47.720 --> 01:37:48.890
你负责讲你的回忆
You the memory.


1180
01:37:59.100 --> 01:38:03.180
你小的时候 在希腊 从自行车上摔下来了对吗
When you were little in Greece, you fell from your bicycle?


1181
01:38:09.850 --> 01:38:11.600
血 顺着我的腿淌下去
Blood. Down my leg.


1182
01:38:15.680 --> 01:38:16.680
快乐吗
Joy?


1183
01:38:16.850 --> 01:38:18.430
你看着血感觉很快乐
You watched the blood with joy.


1184
01:38:19.890 --> 01:38:20.970
敲敲
Knock, knock.


1185
01:38:20.970 --> 01:38:22.010
是谁在门口啊
Qui c'est?


1186
01:38:22.010 --> 01:38:23.000
是奶酪
Fromage.


1187
01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:24.040
请问奶酪您贵姓
Fromage qui?


1188
01:38:24.390 --> 01:38:25.640
很"奶酪"见到你
Cheese to meet you.


1189
01:38:36.350 --> 01:38:37.430
你知道的
You know it.


1190
01:38:41.760 --> 01:38:43.060
你闻起来不错
You smell okay.


1191
01:38:43.220 --> 01:38:44.140
我们做爱吧
Let us fuck.


1192
01:39:29.680 --> 01:39:32.100
古德给了你一份礼物 朋友
God gave you a gift, my friend.


1193
01:40:12.850 --> 01:40:14.930
剖得不够优雅
Very inelegant work.


1194
01:40:15.100 --> 01:40:16.930
你想家的时候就这么做吗
This is what you do when you're homesick?


1195
01:40:32.100 --> 01:40:32.970
你希望什么
You wish what?


1196
01:40:33.140 --> 01:40:36.010
孩子们到了受教育的年龄 性教育
My boys are of an age for education. Sexual.


1197
01:40:37.640 --> 01:40:38.720
我会来演示
I will demonstrate.


1198
01:40:39.560 --> 01:40:40.510
我明白了
I see.


1199
01:40:48.310 --> 01:40:49.260
有时
At times.


1200
01:41:03.890 --> 01:41:06.060
我该躺下 还是弯腰 还是跨骑呢
Shall I lay, bend, astride?


1201
01:41:06.390 --> 01:41:07.850
-我们从简单的开始吧  -好的
Let's start simple, please.


1202
01:41:42.810 --> 01:41:44.180
为了让事情顺利进行
To aid things along...


1203
01:41:44.350 --> 01:41:46.100
-要把一根手指插到屁股里  -不
- a finger in the arse. - No.


1204
01:41:46.260 --> 01:41:48.310
或者有点轻微的窒息感也可以
Or a slight choking may do it.


1205
01:42:16.140 --> 01:42:17.470
回家去吧
Go home!


1206
01:42:25.010 --> 01:42:26.260
贝拉
Bella!


1207
01:42:27.680 --> 01:42:29.510
斯瓦尼夫人说得对
Madam Swiney was right.


1208
01:42:29.680 --> 01:42:32.430
我正在挖掘自己未知的部分
I am discovering parts of myself hitherto unknown.


1209
01:42:32.600 --> 01:42:34.140
这么想也行吧
It is a way to look at it.


1210
01:42:34.890 --> 01:42:38.140
各种各样的欲望被揭露出来是很令人着迷的
The variety of desires being made manifest is fascinating.


1211
01:42:38.310 --> 01:42:39.140
你找到那个男的了吗
Have you had the man...


1212
01:42:39.310 --> 01:42:41.930
就是往你嘴里塞了一块菠萝 然后把你盖在尘土里那个
who puts a wedge of pineapple in your mouth and covers you in dust?


1213
01:42:43.600 --> 01:42:44.430
贝拉
Bella.


1214
01:42:45.810 --> 01:42:47.430
我几乎都准备好原谅你了
I'm almost ready to forgive you.


1215
01:42:47.600 --> 01:42:48.850
我已经订好了回家的铺位
I've booked our berths home...


1216
01:42:49.010 --> 01:42:51.560
让妈妈准备好我们的婚床了
and I've told Mother to prepare our wedding bed.


1217
01:42:52.680 --> 01:42:54.430
你上了那个手上插钩子的家伙吗
Did you fuck that guy with hooks for hands?


1218
01:42:54.600 --> 01:42:56.100
上了 我就知道
You did. I know!


1219
01:42:56.810 --> 01:42:59.260
我把那家伙狠揍了一顿
I beat the tar out of that guy.


1220
01:42:59.430 --> 01:43:01.310
邓肯 我以为你走了
Duncan. I thought you left.


1221
01:43:01.470 --> 01:43:03.850
我是走了 回到船上 但我开始疼痛和呕吐
Back to the ship, but started to ache and vomit...


1222
01:43:04.140 --> 01:43:05.310
所以我来这是来救你的
so I'm here to save you.


1223
01:43:05.470 --> 01:43:06.680
你好 邓肯
Hello, Duncan.


1224
01:43:09.970 --> 01:43:11.180
回家吧 邓肯
Go home, Duncan.


1225
01:43:11.350 --> 01:43:12.810
我们结束了
Our time has ended.


1226
01:43:12.970 --> 01:43:13.890
我看着你却毫无感觉
I look at you and feel nothing...


1227
01:43:14.060 --> 01:43:16.220
但我始终想不通的是 为什么之前会看上你
but the lingering question of how did I ever want you?


1228
01:43:17.260 --> 01:43:19.060
我们要去参加社会主义分子集会了
And we must go to the meeting of socialists.


1229
01:43:21.850 --> 01:43:23.180
你们这些妓女
You're whores.


1230
01:43:23.350 --> 01:43:25.640
我们是自己的生产资料
We are our own means of production.


1231
01:43:25.810 --> 01:43:26.890
快滚吧
Go away.


1232
01:43:39.510 --> 01:43:40.430
脚
Foot.


1233
01:43:42.510 --> 01:43:43.680
画 脚
Paint, foot.


1234
01:43:43.850 --> 01:43:44.850
非常好
Very good.


1235
01:43:48.350 --> 01:43:50.720
语言学习还是慢 但有在进步
Language is slow but improving.


1236
01:43:50.890 --> 01:43:51.890
画 脚
Paint. Foot.


1237
01:43:52.060 --> 01:43:52.970
天才
Genius.


1238
01:43:53.930 --> 01:43:55.810
您能不能别对她那么残忍
Can you not be so cruel to her?


1239
01:43:55.970 --> 01:43:57.510
我在贝拉身上犯了一个错误
I made a mistake with Bella.


1240
01:43:57.680 --> 01:43:59.560
我允许你有感情
I allowed feelings to develop.


1241
01:44:00.350 --> 01:44:03.970
但不准对她动情 她跟那些鸡狗没什么区别
There are none for her. She is no different to the chicken dog.


1242
01:44:04.140 --> 01:44:05.060
脚
Foot.


1243
01:44:05.220 --> 01:44:07.140
也许这样更好吧
It is better this way, perhaps...


1244
01:44:07.310 --> 01:44:10.310
这样我就能对父亲的冷漠有所理解
and gives some insight into my father's coolness to me.


1245
01:44:10.470 --> 01:44:13.100
这就是科学的必需选择
It was a necessity of science.


1246
01:44:13.260 --> 01:44:14.390
天啊 老兄
Good God, man.


1247
01:44:14.600 --> 01:44:17.140
-脚  -我不指望你能懂
- Foot. - I do not expect you to understand...


1248
01:44:17.310 --> 01:44:18.560
乡村医生
village doctor.


1249
01:44:19.760 --> 01:44:22.260
对了 我还要你给我做手术呢
By the way, I need you to operate on me.


1250
01:44:22.720 --> 01:44:24.970
我要给面目可憎的你安上一颗跳动的心脏吗
Shall I put a beating heart in your monstrous form?


1251
01:44:25.890 --> 01:44:27.140
如果你有空的话
If you have time...


1252
01:44:27.970 --> 01:44:29.220
可以在取出这个的同时
while taking...


1253
01:44:31.310 --> 01:44:32.390
给我装个心脏
this out.


1254
01:44:49.720 --> 01:44:52.430
我会把肿瘤周围的一些囊肿切掉
I'll remove some cysts from around the tumor.


1255
01:44:52.600 --> 01:44:55.140
不用了 你缝上就好
No need. You may close me up.


1256
01:44:55.970 --> 01:44:58.560
它已经扩散了 我看到有小息肉
It has spread. I see tiny polyps.


1257
01:45:01.720 --> 01:45:03.010
我快要死了
I am dying.


1258
01:45:03.180 --> 01:45:05.510
要怎么对病人开口呢 嗯
How to break it to the patient, eh?


1259
01:45:06.350 --> 01:45:07.350
巴克斯特
Baxter...


1260
01:45:07.510 --> 01:45:10.560
别对着伤口哭 你会害我因为败血症死得更快的
Do not cry into the wound! You'll kill me faster with sepsis.


1261
01:45:11.260 --> 01:45:12.100
安静下来
Quiet now.


1262
01:45:12.260 --> 01:45:13.680
然后帮我缝好
And close me up.


1263
01:45:15.310 --> 01:45:16.680
找到她
Find her.


1264
01:45:22.100 --> 01:45:23.680
我都关门了
I am closed.


1265
01:45:30.850 --> 01:45:32.720
热巧克力 亲爱的
Hot chocolate, my dear.


1266
01:45:32.890 --> 01:45:34.970
还有巧克力面包
And pain au chocolat.


1267
01:45:43.350 --> 01:45:44.430
你是我的最爱
You are my favorite.


1268
01:45:46.760 --> 01:45:49.390
我听你对别人也这么说
I have heard you say that to the others.


1269
01:45:49.560 --> 01:45:52.970
我们是你用赞美和巧克力浇灌的机器
We are a machine you feed with compliments and chocolate.


1270
01:45:53.140 --> 01:45:55.310
你们是我用爱浇灌的孩子
You are my children I feed with love.


1271
01:46:01.930 --> 01:46:04.890
不好的事发生了 斯瓦尼
Something terrible has happened, Swiney.


1272
01:46:05.510 --> 01:46:07.470
我几乎什么也感觉不到
I feel almost nothing.


1273
01:46:08.970 --> 01:46:12.180
我的同理心正在演变
My empathy is creeping toward what I would describe...


1274
01:46:12.350 --> 01:46:14.470
变成一种傲慢的愤怒
as contemptuous rage.


1275
01:46:14.640 --> 01:46:16.390
太棒了
This is fabulous.


1276
01:46:16.560 --> 01:46:17.390
是吗
It is?


1277
01:46:20.470 --> 01:46:22.510
你正处于黑暗时期
You're in the dark period.


1278
01:46:23.390 --> 01:46:26.310
在光明和智慧降临之前
Before light and wisdom come to you.


1279
01:46:27.680 --> 01:46:29.510
你必须坚持下去
You must forge through it...


1280
01:46:30.310 --> 01:46:31.890
一旦到达彼岸
and once on the other side...


1281
01:46:32.560 --> 01:46:36.510
你就会对这一刻充满感激 但你必须继续前行
you will be grateful to this moment, but you must keep going.


1282
01:46:36.720 --> 01:46:37.760
我懂
I see.


1283
01:47:53.680 --> 01:47:55.100
你有一个小伤疤
You've got a baby scar.


1284
01:47:58.100 --> 01:47:59.390
我的伤疤是和妈妈一起留下的
Mine is with ma maman.


1285
01:48:01.680 --> 01:48:02.850
我没有
I don't have one.


1286
01:48:04.180 --> 01:48:06.350
这是意外的伤疤
It is an accident scar.


1287
01:48:06.510 --> 01:48:08.930
但你不是第一个误会的
But you're not the first to have made the mistake.


1288
01:48:09.100 --> 01:48:10.180
为什么不说实话
Why lie?


1289
01:48:11.140 --> 01:48:12.310
我没有骗你
I'm not lying.


1290
01:48:13.060 --> 01:48:14.810
我的古德温亲口告诉我的
My Godwin told me himself.


1291
01:48:32.720 --> 01:48:33.850
维德伯恩
Wedderburn.


1292
01:48:58.850 --> 01:48:59.970
早上好 先生
Good day, sir.


1293
01:49:04.560 --> 01:49:06.390
你给古德温·巴克斯特写信
You wrote to Mr. Godwin Baxter.


1294
01:49:06.720 --> 01:49:09.010
他把一个无法无天的恶魔送到世上
He has sent a demon at large into the world.


1295
01:49:09.180 --> 01:49:12.600
恶魔存在于一个诱人且永不满足的身体中
The devil's wrapped in an alluring body that cannot be satiated...


1296
01:49:12.760 --> 01:49:15.760
她会一针一针将人拆解开来
and a mind that picks people apart stitch by stitch...


1297
01:49:15.930 --> 01:49:19.470
就像拆解一个被血染 烧焦的布娃娃 接着和大象的粪便一同排出
like a bloodied and burned rag doll shat out of an elephant's arse.


1298
01:49:19.640 --> 01:49:20.390
贝拉
Bella.


1299
01:49:21.140 --> 01:49:22.220
她在哪
Where is she?


1300
01:49:22.390 --> 01:49:23.350
你是谁
Who are you?


1301
01:49:23.510 --> 01:49:25.180
我是她未婚夫
I'm her fiancé, sir.


1302
01:49:29.350 --> 01:49:32.060
看得出来 你们结束得不太和平
Obviously, things did not end well between you.


1303
01:49:32.220 --> 01:49:33.260
不和平
Did not?


1304
01:49:34.060 --> 01:49:35.390
她毁了我
She destroyed me.


1305
01:49:35.560 --> 01:49:38.470
我们都要为自己的行为负责
Well, we're all masters of our own ship, sir.


1306
01:49:38.640 --> 01:49:39.390
话虽没错
There's that.


1307
01:49:39.560 --> 01:49:42.760
但我不喜欢你 也不喜欢你说的话
I do not like you or your words.


1308
01:49:42.930 --> 01:49:44.180
古德温·巴克斯特这混蛋
That Godwin Baxter.


1309
01:49:44.350 --> 01:49:46.390
他什么都知道 让贝拉找上了我
He knew, and he set her on to me.


1310
01:49:46.560 --> 01:49:47.430
他设计害我
He trapped me.


1311
01:49:49.430 --> 01:49:50.180
贝拉在哪
Where is she?


1312
01:49:50.350 --> 01:49:53.260
别跟我提她 我恨她入骨
Would not wish her on my worst enemy.


1313
01:49:55.060 --> 01:49:57.720
我能帮你解决她这个问题
I shall save you from her, sir.


1314
01:50:11.350 --> 01:50:13.680
请原谅我的失望之举 你就告诉我吧
Forgive my frustration. Just tell me.


1315
01:50:13.850 --> 01:50:15.560
你这一拳一点都不疼
It does not hurt.


1316
01:50:15.720 --> 01:50:17.970
我已经五脏俱焚
I have no insides.


1317
01:50:18.140 --> 01:50:19.930
她已把我掏空
She hollowed me out.


1318
01:50:20.100 --> 01:50:22.310
我的灵魂 我的积蓄 都空空如也
My soul. My bank account!


1319
01:50:22.890 --> 01:50:24.180
我只是一只蠹虫 一具空壳
I am a bug! A shell!


1320
01:50:24.350 --> 01:50:25.350
要不我们唱首歌
Shall we sing?


1321
01:50:25.510 --> 01:50:27.680
我们都是水手
Oh, we are sailors...


1322
01:50:27.850 --> 01:50:28.760
这一点
It doesn't...


1323
01:50:30.890 --> 01:50:32.310
一点也不疼
Doesn't hurt.


1324
01:50:34.430 --> 01:50:36.260
我也不想这样
I do not wish it to be like this.


1325
01:50:37.640 --> 01:50:38.680
是你逼我的
You force my hand.


1326
01:50:38.890 --> 01:50:41.390
我们要为自己的行为负责
"We're all masters of our own ship."


1327
01:50:41.560 --> 01:50:44.350
你这婊子养的混蛋傻逼
You cunting cunt-faced deadshit.


1328
01:50:44.760 --> 01:50:45.810
求你了
Please.


1329
01:50:45.970 --> 01:50:47.640
我已经在好言相问了
I ask you as politely as I can.


1330
01:50:47.810 --> 01:50:49.640
她在哪
Where is she?


1331
01:51:12.560 --> 01:51:16.640
伦敦

1332
01:51:45.930 --> 01:51:47.680
那婊子回来了
The whore is back.


1333
01:51:52.850 --> 01:51:53.680
古德
God?


1334
01:51:53.850 --> 01:51:55.140
贝拉
Bella!


1335
01:51:55.310 --> 01:51:56.760
马克斯给我写了信
Max wrote me.


1336
01:51:56.930 --> 01:51:59.220
-你病了  -我不是病了 我是要死了
- You are ill? - I am not. I am dying.


1337
01:51:59.390 --> 01:52:03.180
差别很细微 但我作为内科医生 很重视这一点
A subtle difference, but one I take seriously as a physician.


1338
01:52:03.350 --> 01:52:05.060
你能来我心情就很好了
You are a sight and a good one.


1339
01:52:05.220 --> 01:52:06.060
你不能死
You cannot die.


1340
01:52:06.220 --> 01:52:08.430
经验证明 我会死的
Empirical data says different.


1341
01:52:09.810 --> 01:52:10.680
我好想你
I missed you.


1342
01:52:11.970 --> 01:52:14.890
现在我得躺下了
I now have to lie down.


1343
01:52:21.100 --> 01:52:22.890
我也不只是要带来好心情
It is not all sunshine I bring.


1344
01:52:24.470 --> 01:52:27.180
还要直视你的双眼 问一些难回答的问题
I also bring beady eyes and hard questions.


1345
01:52:28.890 --> 01:52:30.390
我身体里是有一个孩子吗
Did I have a baby in me?


1346
01:52:31.310 --> 01:52:32.560
如果是的话 孩子在哪
And if so, where is it?


1347
01:52:32.720 --> 01:52:33.810
我明白了
I see.


1348
01:52:34.930 --> 01:52:38.640
严格来说 你就是那个孩子
Well, technically, you are your baby.


1349
01:52:38.810 --> 01:52:41.510
而且这样说来 你也既是你的母亲
And also, I suppose you are your mother.


1350
01:52:41.680 --> 01:52:43.510
但又不是
And also neither.


1351
01:52:43.680 --> 01:52:45.470
记忆被抹除
No memory survives.


1352
01:52:45.640 --> 01:52:47.310
经历也不复存在
No experiences survive.


1353
01:52:48.310 --> 01:52:50.390
什么叫我既是母亲又是孩子
What do you mean I am mother and daughter?


1354
01:53:08.510 --> 01:53:10.100
你什么都知道 却什么都不说
You knew and did not tell.


1355
01:53:10.260 --> 01:53:13.310
我当时觉得没必要
I did not see good reason to.


1356
01:53:13.470 --> 01:53:14.600
而且我太懦弱了
And were too cowardly to.


1357
01:53:14.760 --> 01:53:16.390
这也是一个原因
A bit of that as well.


1358
01:53:17.890 --> 01:53:19.430
我想要陪在你身边
I wanted to be with you...


1359
01:53:19.890 --> 01:53:22.220
而且我也不确定 你会不会理解这一切
and I was not sure you would even understand.


1360
01:53:22.390 --> 01:53:25.810
而且巴克斯特控制欲也很强
And Baxter kind of makes one a prisoner to him.


1361
01:53:25.970 --> 01:53:27.180
而且 我
And I am...


1362
01:53:30.470 --> 01:53:31.310
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.


1363
01:53:42.310 --> 01:53:43.220
砰
Bam.


1364
01:53:44.430 --> 01:53:45.470
砰
Bam.


1365
01:53:46.640 --> 01:53:47.560
砰
Bam.


1366
01:53:48.760 --> 01:53:49.760
砰
Bam.


1367
01:53:50.930 --> 01:53:52.010
砰
Bam.


1368
01:53:52.970 --> 01:53:53.930
砰
Bam.


1369
01:53:55.220 --> 01:53:56.220
砰
Bam.


1370
01:53:56.390 --> 01:53:57.390
她是谁
Who is this?


1371
01:53:57.560 --> 01:53:59.560
婊子贝拉
Bell whore


1372
01:53:59.760 --> 01:54:01.850
-婊子贝拉  -看来你已经介绍过我了 普瑞姆女士
- Bell whore - I see you've introduced me then, Prim.


1373
01:54:02.010 --> 01:54:03.890
-但我挺喜欢她的  -婊子贝拉
- I like this one though. - Bell whore


1374
01:54:04.060 --> 01:54:05.970
-够了 费利西蒂  -婊子
- That's enough now, Felicity... - Bell whore


1375
01:54:06.720 --> 01:54:07.600
操
Fucker.


1376
01:54:09.140 --> 01:54:09.970
又一个
Another one?


1377
01:54:10.850 --> 01:54:11.890
我们想你了
We missed you.


1378
01:54:12.260 --> 01:54:13.600
怪物
Monsters.


1379
01:54:15.390 --> 01:54:16.890
操他妈的
Oh, fucking hell.


1380
01:54:17.060 --> 01:54:19.010
婊子
Bell whore


1381
01:54:19.180 --> 01:54:20.810
婊子
Bell whore


1382
01:54:58.510 --> 01:55:01.430
如果一个人已经承受着痛苦 那么我想打他
It is hard to be in the position where one wants to hit someone...


1383
01:55:01.600 --> 01:55:03.470
这有点不方便下手
who is already in obvious pain.


1384
01:55:03.640 --> 01:55:06.430
确实是个难题
It is a conundrum for sure.


1385
01:55:08.180 --> 01:55:12.140
那你宁愿是一团鼻子上有鱼钩的灰色肉块吗
Would you rather be a gray slab of flesh with a fishhook in your nose?


1386
01:55:12.310 --> 01:55:15.220
但是之后很长时间都觉得很糟糕
I will feel good for a second, but bad for longer, so...


1387
01:55:16.680 --> 01:55:18.260
我鼻子上真有个鱼钩吗
I really had a fishhook in my nose?


1388
01:55:18.430 --> 01:55:19.470
是的
You did.


1389
01:55:21.680 --> 01:55:23.560
所以我是你的创造
So, I am your creation...


1390
01:55:25.390 --> 01:55:26.430
她也是
as is the other one.


1391
01:55:26.600 --> 01:55:28.100
你们都不是创作
Neither of you are that.


1392
01:55:28.260 --> 01:55:31.140
她拿着一把锤子 唱着歌 游荡在走廊里
She wanders the halls with a hammer and a song...


1393
01:55:31.310 --> 01:55:32.890
那不是我的过错
and that is not my doing.


1394
01:55:33.510 --> 01:55:35.680
我读了你寄回家的贺卡和信件
And I read your cards and letters home...


1395
01:55:35.850 --> 01:55:39.260
看着你无畏地创造了贝拉·巴克斯特 这是一个奇迹
and watched you fearlessly create Bella Baxter with wonder.


1396
01:55:39.430 --> 01:55:43.140
我觉得活着很好 所以我原谅你
I am finding being alive fascinating, so I'll forgive you the act...


1397
01:55:43.970 --> 01:55:46.220
不过你欺骗并囚禁我 我依然恨你
but always hate the lies and trapping that followed.


1398
01:55:47.180 --> 01:55:48.350
明白了
Understood.


1399
01:55:53.810 --> 01:55:54.930
很高兴见到你
Good to see you.


1400
01:55:55.100 --> 01:55:56.390
我也是
You too.


1401
01:55:57.850 --> 01:56:01.010
我置愤怒 困惑 和大脑中不和谐的声音于不顾 我很想你
Anger, confusion, and brain dissonance aside, I missed you.


1402
01:56:02.350 --> 01:56:04.390
我回到家 闻到甲醛味
I arrived home, and I smelled the formaldehyde...


1403
01:56:04.560 --> 01:56:06.010
我就知道接下来要干什么
and I knew what is next.


1404
01:56:08.720 --> 01:56:10.010
我要成为一名医生
I will be a doctor.


1405
01:56:11.390 --> 01:56:13.470
我的手术任凭你安排
My surgery is yours.


1406
01:56:15.350 --> 01:56:16.640
我的父亲曾告诉我
My father once told me...


1407
01:56:17.890 --> 01:56:20.850
下刀要怀有同情心
always carve with compassion.


1408
01:56:21.010 --> 01:56:23.010
他他妈是个蠢货
He was a fucking idiot.


1409
01:56:23.180 --> 01:56:25.640
不过这意见不坏
But it's not bad advice.


1410
01:56:28.810 --> 01:56:30.430
他也没多长时间活了
He does not have long.


1411
01:56:31.470 --> 01:56:32.600
我知道
I know.


1412
01:56:33.970 --> 01:56:35.890
你怎么对我们的婚约只字不提
You've not mentioned our betrothal.


1413
01:56:37.720 --> 01:56:39.640
你那时还年轻
You were much younger.


1414
01:56:40.810 --> 01:56:42.100
没什么束缚
There is no bind.


1415
01:56:42.260 --> 01:56:45.260
我对你着迷 而巴克斯特利用了我
I was mesmerized by you, and Baxter took advantage.


1416
01:56:45.430 --> 01:56:47.180
所以你不再喜欢我了
So, you are mesmerized no more?


1417
01:56:47.600 --> 01:56:50.430
我依然着迷
I am still mesmerized.


1418
01:56:51.010 --> 01:56:52.470
我曾是一个妓女 你明白吗
I've been a whore, you understand?


1419
01:56:53.430 --> 01:56:55.720
-嗯  -为了金钱 我让男人进入我的身体
Cocks for money inside me.


1420
01:56:55.890 --> 01:56:57.010
你对这件事没意见吗
You okay with that?


1421
01:56:57.850 --> 01:57:00.180
我卖淫这件事会不会
Does the whoring thing challenge the desire...


1422
01:57:00.350 --> 01:57:02.180
考验你心中男人固有的占有欲
for ownership that men have?


1423
01:57:02.350 --> 01:57:04.720
维德伯恩知道我在卖淫时
Wedderburn became much weepy and sweary...


1424
01:57:04.890 --> 01:57:06.430
又哭又骂
when he discovered my whoring.


1425
01:57:07.060 --> 01:57:10.810
我只是嫉妒那些男人能陪伴你
I find myself merely jealous of the men's time with you...


1426
01:57:10.970 --> 01:57:14.010
我对你没有任何道德上的谴责
rather than any moral aspersion against you.


1427
01:57:14.180 --> 01:57:15.720
这是你的身体 贝拉·巴克斯特
It is your body, Bella Baxter.


1428
01:57:15.890 --> 01:57:17.600
你可以随意支配
Yours to give freely.


1429
01:57:18.640 --> 01:57:20.140
我一般要30法郎
I generally charged 30 francs.


1430
01:57:20.600 --> 01:57:22.890
听起来不多
Well, that seems low.


1431
01:57:24.100 --> 01:57:26.810
你相信人们能进步吗 马克斯
Do you believe people improvable, Max?


1432
01:57:26.970 --> 01:57:27.810
我相信
I do.


1433
01:57:27.970 --> 01:57:30.930
就像身体的疾病可以被治愈一样
Just as a human body can be cured of illness...


1434
01:57:31.100 --> 01:57:34.430
人们也可以在一些方面进步
so can men and women be cured of aspect.


1435
01:57:36.640 --> 01:57:38.560
你愿意娶我吗 马克斯·麦克坎多斯
Will you marry me, Max McCandles?


1436
01:57:40.810 --> 01:57:41.680
我愿意
I will.


1437
01:57:49.060 --> 01:57:50.600
以后你可以少说点话
We will need less of your tongue in the future...


1438
01:57:50.760 --> 01:57:52.470
不过总体来说 我们相处得很好
but overall, most agreeable.


1439
01:57:52.640 --> 01:57:54.470
我记住了
I will take that note.


1440
01:57:56.350 --> 01:57:59.600
你体检过吗
And have you been checked for disease?


1441
01:57:59.760 --> 01:58:01.510
还没有 不过我会去的
I have not, but I shall.


1442
01:58:02.180 --> 01:58:04.350
我很享受我们之间这种实际的爱情
I'm enjoying this practical love we have.


1443
01:58:06.260 --> 01:58:09.430
我向你保证 我的爱也充满了激情
But I assure you mine is also passionate.


1444
01:58:10.260 --> 01:58:11.600
你真可爱
You are adorable.


1445
01:58:12.390 --> 01:58:13.560
你一直很可爱
You always were.


1446
01:58:23.470 --> 01:58:24.810
古德 你居然走路了
God, you are walking.


1447
01:58:24.970 --> 01:58:28.470
我因为脚趾疼注射了五毫克海洛因
I have taken five milligrams of heroin through the toes for pain...


1448
01:58:28.640 --> 01:58:29.930
吃了点安非他命提神
amphetamines for energy...


1449
01:58:30.100 --> 01:58:33.720
还有可卡因 因为我喜欢可卡因
and cocaine because I am partial to cocaine.


1450
01:58:33.890 --> 01:58:36.890
我来陪你走向圣坛
I've come here to walk you down the aisle.


1451
01:58:49.560 --> 01:58:52.390
根据教会赋予我的权力
And so, by the powers vested in me by the church...


1452
01:58:52.560 --> 01:58:54.310
我在此宣告两人的结合
I shall solemnize this union.


1453
01:58:55.430 --> 01:58:59.260
贝拉·巴克斯特 你是否接受这个男人成为你的丈夫
Do you, Bella Baxter, take this man as your husband?


1454
01:58:59.430 --> 01:59:02.220
我们是不是忘了问有没有人反对
Did we miss the part about anyone objecting to this?


1455
01:59:02.850 --> 01:59:07.760
还是因为教理问答的伪现代化改造 导致这部分被删掉了
Or has that been removed in some kind of faux modernization of the catechism?


1456
01:59:11.100 --> 01:59:12.510
你好 维多利亚
Hello, Victoria.


1457
01:59:13.260 --> 01:59:14.310
你看起来很不错
You look well.


1458
01:59:15.470 --> 01:59:17.430
你是说我吗 先生
Do you refer to me, sir?


1459
01:59:17.600 --> 01:59:20.310
男人通常不会向妻子做自我介绍
A man doesn't normally introduce himself to his wife.


1460
01:59:20.470 --> 01:59:21.930
如果我必须介绍的话
But if I must...


1461
01:59:23.310 --> 01:59:24.810
他是幕后主使古德
He is the God of it.


1462
01:59:25.430 --> 01:59:28.010
我不知道是他控制了她 还是她控制了他
I do not know if he's in her power or she in his.


1463
01:59:28.180 --> 01:59:30.180
这是魔鬼的杰作 看啊
'Tis Devil's work at hand. Look!


1464
01:59:30.350 --> 01:59:33.220
他咳出的不是空气 而是血
He coughs not air as a normal man but blood.


1465
01:59:33.390 --> 01:59:35.180
他得癌症了 你个白痴
He has cancer, you fucking idiot.


1466
01:59:37.010 --> 01:59:37.850
邓肯
Duncan.


1467
01:59:38.010 --> 01:59:40.180
不要盯着我看 恶魔
Do not lay your eyes on me, demon!


1468
01:59:42.390 --> 01:59:45.810
正如我所说 我是阿尔弗雷德·布莱辛顿将军
As I was saying, General Alfred Blessington.


1469
01:59:46.600 --> 01:59:48.220
你叫我阿尔菲
"Alfie" to you.


1470
01:59:48.390 --> 01:59:49.850
你真的不记得我吗
You really do not know me?


1471
01:59:51.140 --> 01:59:53.310
维德伯恩先生把你的照片刊登在报纸上的时候
When Mr. Wedderburn put your photo in the paper...


1472
01:59:53.470 --> 01:59:57.890
我记起旅馆那个老太婆叫你维多利亚·布莱辛顿
I remembered that old bird in the hotel called you Victoria Blessington...


1473
01:59:58.060 --> 02:00:02.310
我便拼凑出了这幅邪恶的拼图
and I pieced this diabolical fuckfest of a puzzle together.


1474
02:00:04.310 --> 02:00:06.140
-你是  -你亲爱的阿尔菲
- You are... - Your dear Alfie.


1475
02:00:06.810 --> 02:00:11.470
你离开的时候 因为怀孕 既焦虑又歇斯底里
You left in a state of some mental addlement and hysteria over your pregnancy.


1476
02:00:12.680 --> 02:00:15.600
我发现你离开后 感觉被开膛破肚了
On the discovery of your absence, I felt disemboweled.


1477
02:00:16.260 --> 02:00:18.760
我曾在战场上把人开膛破肚
I have disemboweled men on the field of battle...


1478
02:00:18.930 --> 02:00:23.260
想象那会是一种沉闷又空洞的疼痛
and I always imagined a dull, hollow throbbing...


1479
02:00:23.760 --> 02:00:25.810
我当时就是这种感觉
and that is what it was like.


1480
02:00:26.680 --> 02:00:31.350
尸体还会散发恶臭 但在这里不适合用作比喻
There's also a stench, but that does not apply as a metaphor here.


1481
02:00:32.720 --> 02:00:34.560
我找到你了 亲爱的
But here you are, my darling.


1482
02:00:35.600 --> 02:00:36.470
我找到你了
Here you are.


1483
02:00:37.010 --> 02:00:37.930
天呐
God.


1484
02:00:38.100 --> 02:00:39.890
我不记得你了
I have no recollection of you.


1485
02:00:40.760 --> 02:00:42.350
我是贝拉·巴克斯特
I am Bella Baxter.


1486
02:00:42.510 --> 02:00:43.600
太伤人了
Hurtful.


1487
02:00:44.260 --> 02:00:45.720
或许是你撞到了头
But perhaps you've hit your head...


1488
02:00:45.890 --> 02:00:48.100
这些人便利用了你
and these men have clearly taken advantage of you.


1489
02:00:48.260 --> 02:00:50.010
请你离开 先生
Please go, sir.


1490
02:00:51.760 --> 02:00:54.140
-你以前是我的丈夫吗  -我是你亲爱的阿尔菲
- You were my husband? - Your dear Alfie.


1491
02:00:54.310 --> 02:00:56.430
贝拉 我很抱歉
Bella, I'm sorry.


1492
02:01:02.600 --> 02:01:04.260
我想离开了
Actually, I would like to go.


1493
02:01:04.850 --> 02:01:05.680
-什么  -贝拉
What?


1494
02:01:05.850 --> 02:01:06.720
-什么  -贝拉
Bella?


1495
02:01:10.560 --> 02:01:12.100
-你有马车吗  -先生
You have a carriage, sir?


1496
02:01:13.220 --> 02:01:14.310
有
Yes.


1497
02:01:14.470 --> 02:01:15.430
我们走吧
Let us go then.


1498
02:01:15.600 --> 02:01:16.470
贝拉
Bella!


1499
02:01:16.640 --> 02:01:17.890
让我走吧 古德
Let me go, God.


1500
02:01:18.640 --> 02:01:20.140
马克斯 你不要阻止我
Max, you will not stop me.


1501
02:01:29.350 --> 02:01:31.390
你能回来简直太好了 维多利亚
It is good to have you back, Victoria.


1502
02:01:47.850 --> 02:01:49.560
我和仆人们关系不太好
The servants and I have not been getting along.


1503
02:01:49.720 --> 02:01:51.140
我担心他们会造反
I fear an uprising.


1504
02:02:01.220 --> 02:02:02.720
记得大卫吗 亲爱的
You remember David, darling?


1505
02:02:04.930 --> 02:02:07.180
阿丽森 看看谁回来了
Allison, look who's back.


1506
02:02:13.810 --> 02:02:15.010
你认识我吗
You know me?


1507
02:02:16.850 --> 02:02:18.220
跟我讲讲我自己
Tell me about myself.


1508
02:02:20.680 --> 02:02:21.810
我待人友善吗
Was I nice?


1509
02:02:59.140 --> 02:02:59.970
吃吧
Eat.


1510
02:03:01.510 --> 02:03:02.720
都是你喜欢的
All your favorites.


1511
02:03:02.890 --> 02:03:04.810
熏鱼 鹅肉
Kippers, goose...


1512
02:03:05.600 --> 02:03:08.140
牛舌 香槟
tongue, champagne.


1513
02:03:08.930 --> 02:03:09.930
我很想你
I've missed you.


1514
02:03:12.010 --> 02:03:14.010
婚姻不幸的根源是什么
What was the root of the unhappiness?


1515
02:03:15.810 --> 02:03:18.010
她为什么要从桥上跳下去
What drove her to leap off the bridge?


1516
02:03:20.890 --> 02:03:22.560
你讨厌那个小孩
You hated the baby.


1517
02:03:22.720 --> 02:03:24.310
你叫它怪物
You called it "the monster."


1518
02:03:25.510 --> 02:03:26.600
我明白了
I see.


1519
02:03:28.260 --> 02:03:30.560
我已经意识到我缺少母性的本能
I have noticed a lack of maternal instinct.


1520
02:03:32.220 --> 02:03:34.060
但我还是很高兴你能回家
And yet I'm happy to have you home.


1521
02:03:36.720 --> 02:03:37.850
我们是怎么认识的来着
How did we meet?


1522
02:03:38.510 --> 02:03:40.010
在舞会上
At a ball.


1523
02:03:40.180 --> 02:03:41.600
那我们为什么喜欢对方呢
Why did we like each other?


1524
02:03:43.180 --> 02:03:45.010
我们都喜欢找乐子
We shared a love of good times.


1525
02:03:46.810 --> 02:03:47.680
看着
Watch.


1526
02:03:49.220 --> 02:03:51.180
阿丽森 上汤
Allison, soup!


1527
02:04:00.970 --> 02:04:01.680
雷克斯
Rex!


1528
02:04:07.640 --> 02:04:08.430
-该死
Fuck!


1529
02:04:08.600 --> 02:04:09.680
阿丽森
Allison...


1530
02:04:10.430 --> 02:04:12.100
等你清洁好了 我们要吃奶酪
we'll have some cheese when you can.


1531
02:04:18.600 --> 02:04:20.100
-我们喜欢对人残忍吗  -嗯
A love of cruelty?


1532
02:04:22.310 --> 02:04:25.260
看来 我不是一个善良的人
- I was not a kind person, it seems. - Kind?


1533
02:04:25.890 --> 02:04:27.970
善良 你可没这么无聊维多利亚
You would never be so dull, Victoria.


1534
02:04:28.140 --> 02:04:29.310
这想法太糟糕了
Appalling idea.


1535
02:04:30.510 --> 02:04:31.930
维德伯恩说你当过妓女
Wedderburn says you were a whore.


1536
02:04:32.100 --> 02:04:33.890
-我觉得那有点  -我是当过
- I suspect that was part... - I was.


1537
02:04:34.060 --> 02:04:34.890
在巴黎的时候
In Paris.


1538
02:04:35.430 --> 02:04:37.850
现在我厌倦了 但是那段时光很有意思
I tired of it, but it was fascinating.


1539
02:04:39.180 --> 02:04:41.810
-好吧  -这些熏鱼有点怪 但是挺好吃的
- Right. - These kippers are strangely delicious.


1540
02:04:42.560 --> 02:04:44.350
放了醋或者别的什么
Vinegary or something.


1541
02:04:51.350 --> 02:04:53.430
婚姻会带来持续的挑战
Marriage is a constant challenge.


1542
02:04:54.060 --> 02:04:56.560
有些问题我们能解决 而有些我们不得不妥协
Some, we bend to, some we bend to us.


1543
02:04:59.220 --> 02:05:01.350
我会尽力原谅你卖淫的事
I will try to forgive you for the whoring.


1544
02:05:02.060 --> 02:05:05.180
你在性爱方面的疯狂总是一发不可收拾
Your sexual hysteria was often out of hand.


1545
02:05:05.890 --> 02:05:07.810
我也会尽力原谅你杀死了我们尚未出生的孩子
And for the killing of our unborn child.


1546
02:05:08.850 --> 02:05:11.310
说实话 要是我把你对不起我的事一一列举出来
In fact, when I list the ways you've wronged me...


1547
02:05:11.470 --> 02:05:15.470
耶稣基督他本人 都会亲自用球棒敲你的脑袋
Jesus Christ himself would probably beat your head in with a bat.


1548
02:05:19.260 --> 02:05:21.060
有一个宽容的丈夫是你的福气
You're blessed with a forgiving husband.


1549
02:05:22.890 --> 02:05:24.720
我可没有对不起你 阿尔菲
I've not wronged you, Alfie...


1550
02:05:25.310 --> 02:05:26.680
因为我根本不认识你
as I do not know you.


1551
02:05:26.850 --> 02:05:30.760
你很幸运 因为我在失忆症领域经验丰富
Well, you're in luck as I've had a lot of experience in the field with amnesia.


1552
02:05:30.930 --> 02:05:33.640
我认识那些想忘记自己曾身处战场的人
Either men who wish to forget where they were...


1553
02:05:33.810 --> 02:05:35.720
还有人想忘记如钟声般
or a mortar exploded nearby...


1554
02:05:35.890 --> 02:05:37.930
在头盖骨内鸣响的迫击炮声
ringing their cranium like a church bell.


1555
02:05:38.930 --> 02:05:41.810
我建议我们在房子这里待几个月
I suggest we stick close to the house for several months...


1556
02:05:41.970 --> 02:05:43.140
或者待一年
maybe a year.


1557
02:05:45.930 --> 02:05:47.600
直到你完全康复为止
Until you've made a full recovery.


1558
02:05:50.220 --> 02:05:53.760
我想走就走 但是你想困住我 真是让我受宠若惊
I will leave at my leisure, but I am flattered by your desire to trap me.


1559
02:05:55.970 --> 02:05:57.140
你可不是第一个这么做的人
You're not the first.


1560
02:05:59.220 --> 02:06:01.430
亲爱的 你要是想走的话
I will have to shoot you in the fucking head...


1561
02:06:02.060 --> 02:06:03.890
我他妈会一枪打在你的头上
if you try to leave, darling.


1562
02:06:04.060 --> 02:06:05.720
从前面打还是从后面打
The front or the back of the head?


1563
02:06:05.890 --> 02:06:07.220
后面
The back.


1564
02:06:07.390 --> 02:06:08.760
这样才能确认你是真的要走
As to be sure you were leaving...


1565
02:06:08.930 --> 02:06:10.720
而我没有草率行事
and I was not being rash.


1566
02:06:16.260 --> 02:06:17.810
我好想你
I have missed you.


1567
02:06:21.720 --> 02:06:23.510
所以 我是囚犯了
So, I'm a prisoner?


1568
02:06:24.220 --> 02:06:27.220
这次谈话的走向 令人遗憾
This conversation has gone down an unfortunate route.


1569
02:06:28.260 --> 02:06:31.010
我确信你会和以前一样快乐
I am sure you will be as happy as you were before.


1570
02:06:32.350 --> 02:06:34.890
像我从桥上跳下来之前一样快乐吗
As I was before when I threw myself from a bridge?


1571
02:06:41.220 --> 02:06:43.930
我觉得你是找鱼的时候摔下去的
I suspect you fell while looking for fish.


1572
02:06:45.640 --> 02:06:48.310
你为什么要违背我的意愿 把我留在这里呢
Why would you want to keep me here if I do not wish to stay?


1573
02:06:48.930 --> 02:06:53.260
要是一定要溺死 就溺死在爱河里吧
If one must drown, let it be in the river of love.


1574
02:07:03.060 --> 02:07:03.970
大卫
David...


1575
02:07:05.350 --> 02:07:07.510
这只野鸡难道吃完了吗
does that pheasant look stripped to the bone?


1576
02:07:07.970 --> 02:07:09.810
先生 我看错了
It was a misjudgment, sir.


1577
02:07:10.430 --> 02:07:11.970
对不起
I apologize.


1578
02:07:20.310 --> 02:07:22.180
亲爱的 要吃甜点吗
Dessert, darling?


1579
02:08:20.470 --> 02:08:22.060
容易弄下来吗
It comes off easy?


1580
02:08:22.220 --> 02:08:23.640
就像摘下西装扣子一样简单
Like a button on a suit.


1581
02:08:25.010 --> 02:08:27.310
我在非洲见过他们用磨尖的石头做这个
I saw them do it in Africa with sharpened rocks...


1582
02:08:27.470 --> 02:08:31.140
但是我自己做了一个精度更高的版本
but had my own more precise device made.


1583
02:08:32.930 --> 02:08:34.310
你是只想割阴蒂包皮
Do you want just clitoral hood...


1584
02:08:34.470 --> 02:08:36.060
还是连阴蒂头也一起
or glans as well?


1585
02:08:36.220 --> 02:08:38.010
把她邪恶的阴部全割下来
The whole infernal packet.


1586
02:08:38.180 --> 02:08:40.100
能让她永远安分下来
It will calm her no end.


1587
02:08:40.260 --> 02:08:41.810
这次我们会成功的
This time we will get it done.


1588
02:08:42.600 --> 02:08:44.760
我会先给她打镇定剂 然后今晚带她去你的手术室
I shall get her sedated and bring her to your surgery this evening.


1589
02:08:55.640 --> 02:08:57.930
维多利亚 亲爱的
Victoria, darling!


1590
02:08:59.260 --> 02:09:00.430
你在哪
Where are you?


1591
02:09:05.930 --> 02:09:07.310
时机刚好
Perfect timing.


1592
02:09:07.470 --> 02:09:08.350
来杯马蒂尼
Martini.


1593
02:09:08.510 --> 02:09:09.760
还是不了
Rather not.


1594
02:09:10.310 --> 02:09:12.220
不过 我想我还是想离开这
I would, however, like to leave.


1595
02:09:12.680 --> 02:09:14.720
我认为我们一起的时光是有趣的
I have found our time together interesting...


1596
02:09:14.890 --> 02:09:17.430
但我明白我为什么会跳桥了
but I've ascertained why I jumped from a bridge.


1597
02:09:18.260 --> 02:09:20.810
我希望去看看古德 他快不行了
I wish to go see my near dead God.


1598
02:09:21.430 --> 02:09:22.390
不错的想法
Adorable idea.


1599
02:09:22.560 --> 02:09:24.060
不幸的是 亲爱的
Unfortunately, my darling...


1600
02:09:24.220 --> 02:09:27.310
我的一生都致力于侵占土地
my life is dedicated to the taking of territory.


1601
02:09:27.470 --> 02:09:28.310
而你是我的
You are mine...


1602
02:09:28.470 --> 02:09:30.560
我言尽于此
and that is the long and short of it.


1603
02:09:31.310 --> 02:09:32.760
我不是领土
I am not territory.


1604
02:09:32.930 --> 02:09:36.560
问题的根源就在你两腿之间
The root of the problem is between your legs.


1605
02:09:36.720 --> 02:09:37.720
我会彻底解决它
I will have it off...


1606
02:09:37.890 --> 02:09:40.720
让它不会使你分心也不会使你变心
and it will not distract and divert you anymore.


1607
02:09:40.890 --> 02:09:43.970
你看 一个男人穷尽一生 和他的性冲动纠缠
You see, a man spends his life wrangling his sexual compulsions.


1608
02:09:44.140 --> 02:09:47.260
这是种诅咒 但 某种层面上也是他一生的事业
It's a curse and yet, in some ways, his life's work.


1609
02:09:47.430 --> 02:09:49.470
女人一生的事业是孩子
A woman's life's work is children.


1610
02:09:49.640 --> 02:09:52.640
我打算摆脱你两腿间那个邪恶的东西
I intend to rid you of that infernal packet between your legs...


1611
02:09:52.810 --> 02:09:55.060
并且直接在你身体里埋一颗种子
and plant a seed in you straight after.


1612
02:09:55.220 --> 02:09:57.470
我来解释下发生了什么
Let me explain what has happened.


1613
02:09:57.640 --> 02:10:01.470
维多利亚 你的妻子 从桥上跳下去淹死了
Victoria, your wife, threw herself from a bridge and died.


1614
02:10:01.640 --> 02:10:04.680
古德温·巴克斯特发现了她 把她带回了手术室
Godwin Baxter found her, brought her to his surgery.


1615
02:10:04.850 --> 02:10:07.970
他摘出了她怀着的婴儿 取出了婴儿的大脑
He then removed the baby, removed the brain from the baby...


1616
02:10:08.140 --> 02:10:11.100
将婴儿大脑移植回了这具身体并重塑了我
transplanted it into my head and reanimated me.


1617
02:10:11.560 --> 02:10:13.970
我会给你带手术档案的 听起来很迷人啊
I'll bring you the file. It's actually quite fascinating.


1618
02:10:14.140 --> 02:10:15.930
总之 我要保留我的新人生
However, I will keep my new life...


1619
02:10:16.100 --> 02:10:18.470
以及我可爱的旧阴蒂 谢谢
and my lovely old clitoris, thank you.


1620
02:10:18.640 --> 02:10:20.260
请你为我叫一辆马车
If you'd call a carriage for me.


1621
02:10:21.100 --> 02:10:22.100
他们聊了又聊
They talk and talk...


1622
02:10:22.260 --> 02:10:24.810
然后在某一刻 除了拔枪无话可说
and yet at some point there's nothing left but to pull a gun.


1623
02:10:26.390 --> 02:10:27.850
这就是对女人的方式
'Tis the way with women.


1624
02:10:40.810 --> 02:10:41.680
你屈服了吗
Are you giving in?


1625
02:10:42.850 --> 02:10:45.810
我宁愿你给我的心脏来一枪也不会屈服
I'd rather you shot me in the fucking heart.


1626
02:10:45.970 --> 02:10:48.260
如果我不得不的话我会做的
I will oblige if I have to.


1627
02:10:49.890 --> 02:10:51.470
喝了这杯 亲爱的
Drink the drink, darling.


1628
02:10:52.350 --> 02:10:53.310
金酒和麻醉剂
Chloroform and gin.


1629
02:11:03.140 --> 02:11:06.930
某种层面上说 摆脱不断追寻的自我 是一种解脱
In some ways it would be a relief to be rid of my questing self.


1630
02:11:07.430 --> 02:11:09.890
喝了这杯 自由就是你的了
Sip deeply and that freedom is yours.


1631
02:11:22.640 --> 02:11:23.640
妈的
Fuck.


1632
02:11:38.390 --> 02:11:39.390
马克斯
Max?


1633
02:11:42.600 --> 02:11:45.680
马克斯 我们必须得带他去做手术
Max. We have to get him to surgery.


1634
02:11:46.560 --> 02:11:47.760
否则他会死的
He'll die if we don't.


1635
02:11:47.930 --> 02:11:49.010
他出血好多
Bleeding a lot.


1636
02:11:49.180 --> 02:11:51.260
你他妈死定了
You're fucking dead.


1637
02:11:52.390 --> 02:11:53.970
贝拉 如果他活着
Bella, if he lives...


1638
02:11:54.140 --> 02:11:57.600
我觉得他不会善罢甘休的
I do not sense he is a man who will stop.


1639
02:11:58.100 --> 02:11:59.810
我不能看着他失血而死
Well, I won't watch him bleed to death.


1640
02:12:00.350 --> 02:12:02.390
但我同意 他有进步空间
But I agree, he could do with improvement.


1641
02:12:15.430 --> 02:12:17.430
我已经摘除了子弹 也止血了
I've removed the bullet and stopped the bleeding.


1642
02:12:18.010 --> 02:12:19.350
我拿来了笔记
I have the notes.


1643
02:12:27.430 --> 02:12:29.850
我在这儿比在其他地方都要开心
I am never happier than when I'm in here.


1644
02:13:02.600 --> 02:13:04.060
贝拉
Bella.


1645
02:13:04.220 --> 02:13:05.430
你回来了
You're back.


1646
02:13:11.350 --> 02:13:13.810
那只是别人的故事
It was just a story of someone else...


1647
02:13:15.010 --> 02:13:16.510
不是贝拉·巴克斯特的故事
not Bella Baxter.


1648
02:13:24.470 --> 02:13:27.430
我的一生中 人们看我的眼神都充满了
All my life, people's eyes looked at me...


1649
02:13:27.600 --> 02:13:29.560
恐惧 怜悯
horror, pity...


1650
02:13:31.260 --> 02:13:32.430
但你
but you.


1651
02:13:39.970 --> 02:13:42.060
我们经历的一切
It's all very interesting...


1652
02:13:44.100 --> 02:13:45.720
都是那么有趣
what is happening.


1653
02:14:45.600 --> 02:14:47.510
解剖学考试让我很紧张
Anatomy exam is making me nervous.


1654
02:14:47.680 --> 02:14:50.100
我给你测试过很多次了 你没问题的
I've tested you many times. You know it.


1655
02:14:51.510 --> 02:14:53.510
没人比你更了解解剖了
No one knows anatomy better than you.


1656
02:14:58.140 --> 02:14:59.260
女士们 金酒喝吗
Ladies, gin?


1657
02:15:00.470 --> 02:15:01.140
当然
Please.


1658
02:15:01.680 --> 02:15:02.510
金酒
Gin?


1659
02:15:05.350 --> 02:15:07.760
