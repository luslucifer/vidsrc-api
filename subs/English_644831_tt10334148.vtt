an afternoon alone with me.

Or, what would
be more interesting


860

is if it's the wife
who set him up.

Why would the wife send
her husband to the gallows?

It's obvious, darling.

Susan Rutherford becomes
the prime suspect


864
00:39:48.004 --> 00:39:50.500
when her alibi fails to
materialize, and we naturally


865
00:39:50.532 --> 00:39:52.900
assume that she's trying
to protect the reputation


866
00:39:52.932 --> 00:39:54.756
of the foreign secretary,
whose aspirations


867
00:39:54.789 --> 00:39:57.349
of becoming the prime minister
would be severely compromised


868
00:39:57.381 --> 00:40:01.061
if it was revealed that
he was having an affair.


869
00:40:01.094 --> 00:40:04.006
But, in reality, nothing could
be further from the truth,


870
00:40:04.038 --> 00:40:06.182
which is what we learn
from the victim himself.


871
00:40:06.214 --> 00:40:08.806
And it's only through the medium
that they can work it out.

That she's pregnant
with the dead

I'm afraid, Mrs.
Condomine, the time has come


881
00:40:29.385 --> 00:40:31.497
for me to admit quite frankly,

882
00:40:31.529 --> 00:40:34.281
I haven't the foggiest
idea how to send her back.


883
00:40:35.625 --> 00:40:37.802
I have my own personal
reasons for wishing


884
00:40:37.834 --> 00:40:40.234
to communicate
with the departed,


885
00:40:40.267 --> 00:40:42.762
but I never for a moment
considered the possibility


886
00:40:42.795 --> 00:40:44.874
of having to send someone back.

887
00:40:44.907 --> 00:40:47.755
Well I suggest
that you find a way.


888
00:40:47.787 --> 00:40:50.635
I refuse to share my
husband with anyone,

especially his dead ex-wife.

890
00:40:52.940 --> 00:40:55.020
Well if I thought for a
moment that your husband


891
00:40:55.052 --> 00:40:57.356
wished to get in
touch with the spirit


892
00:40:57.389 --> 00:40:59.597
of his dead ex-wife,
I would have of course


893
00:40:59.628 --> 00:41:00.781
consulted you first.

894

After all, <i>noblesse oblige</i>.

895
00:41:02.733 --> 00:41:04.526
He had no intention of
getting in touch with her.


896
00:41:04.557 --> 00:41:05.678
I can assure you.

897

planned in order

to get material for
his new project.

Am I to understand I was
invited in the spirit of mockery?


900

He merely wanted
to make some notes

of the tricks of the trade.

insulted in my life.

all came out wrong.
