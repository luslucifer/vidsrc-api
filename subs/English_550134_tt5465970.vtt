They come from the door! Kill them!

2
00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.286
War load is heavy.

3
00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:51.001
What do you think war is needed,
that good can take victory from evil.


4
00:02:14.274 --> 00:02:19.446
But sometimes the purpose
not enough tools to sacrifice.


5
00:02:33.043 --> 00:02:36.380
Ax. Ax!

6
00:02:42.803 --> 00:02:47.265
In the name of justice
have gone into excesses.


7
00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:53.397
Spirit hengest
just continue to twist into eternities.


8
00:03:12.332 --> 00:03:16.420
The war is in
the midst of the war.

9
00:03:18.755 --> 00:03:25.262
The horizons of my way
are the end of my work.

10
00:03:25.387 --> 00:03:28.598
Min  I'm in the Buddha.

11
00:03:28.682 --> 00:03:31.852
Min  I'm in Dharma.

00:03:31.977 --> 00:03:35.939
Minxi I'm in Sangha.

13
00:03:44.531 --> 00:03:47.868
The world is drowning in decay.

14
00:03:47.951 --> 00:03:52.039
Mong Lan
Evil rages in his power.


15
00:03:52.122 --> 00:03:57.461
Annual value of human trafficking
is estimated at $ 32 billion.


16
00:03:57.544 --> 00:04:03.342
The value of the trader's store
estimated at $ 23 billion.


17
00:04:03.425 --> 00:04:09.389
The value of the drug trade
estimated at $ 150 billion.


18
00:04:09.473 --> 00:04:15.437
How can we resist evil,
when the whole world is lost?


19
00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:21.485
Especially in Mong Lassa, the criminals
manage the border town?


20
00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:21.105
K yk   sit down. The doctor comes in
and take you all. Everything.


21
00:06:21.188 --> 00:06:25.567
Go to the queue and
wait for the t ss .

K yk   queue.
The doctor is all right.


26
00:06:41.583 --> 00:06:44.545
There is no such thing to you.

27
00:06:59.226 --> 00:07:02.604
H  can not take all the time.

28
00:07:02.688 --> 00:07:07.276
Be good and wait.
H n comes in.

H n takes everyone.


30
00:07:13.031 --> 00:07:17.244
Good morning.

31
00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:27.504
- Whose turn?
- Mr. Something.


32
00:07:43.687 --> 00:07:47.316
Chen Man has come to meet you.

33
00:08:19.223 --> 00:08:25.270
Hello, brother.
A two-pound stroke?


34
00:08:25.354 --> 00:08:29.942
- I forgot it.

35
00:08:36.407 --> 00:08:41.036
- Brother.
- Come on. Sit and take teet .


36
00:09:04.351 --> 00:09:09.732
- Have you got a sip?
- We met last month.


37
00:09:09.857 --> 00:09:16.113
Ik  begins to weigh, but h n does not agree
my nt m  n sit , especially the sick.


38
00:09:17.239 --> 00:09:22.953
- Do you think I could help h nt ?
- Time is like a slaughterer's knife.


39
00:09:23.078 --> 00:09:25.623
Nobody can do that.

40
00:09:30.419 --> 00:09:34.757
- You saw me meeting h nt .
- The purpose is. Menn together.


41
00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:39.470
You're lucky because Sifu taught you
the most powerful stick-kung-fun.


42
00:09:39.553 --> 00:09:41.972
How come?
Did not he teach you?


43
00:09:42.097 --> 00:09:46.769
No, and now h nest  not en
would be to teach.


44
00:09:46.852 --> 00:09:49.939
I think,
that's just more than me.


45
00:09:51.482 --> 00:09:55.986
Is it true,
that Sifu gave you all your shape?


46
00:09:56.070 --> 00:10:01.492
Believe it, it is true.

47
00:10:01.659 --> 00:10:07.373
- They were really cool.
- How would you do it?


48
00:10:07.498 --> 00:10:13.671
Just calculate the play.
Siit  has been beaten for 40 years.


49
00:10:13.754 --> 00:10:19.051
I know I do not want to
with jokes about  idist si. Please apologize.


50
00:10:19.176 --> 00:10:23.931
- Menn  n.
- Now?


51
00:10:24.014 --> 00:10:28.394
If you have not forgotten.

52
00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:06.826
In the words of our Great Master:

53
00:12:06.909 --> 00:12:12.456
"Unless your mind is empty and calm,
butterfly leans off. "


54
00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:17.044
Brother, you guys martial arts,
and you have a good heart.


55
00:12:17.169 --> 00:12:21.132
Thanks brother. Thank you.
Look. It did not fly.


56
00:12:26.387 --> 00:12:31.684
- The second half of the Ent  form?
- I'll do it next time.


57
00:12:31.809 --> 00:12:36.063
- Why not immediately?
- Because you have patients.


58
00:12:36.147 --> 00:12:40.526
And you have to be k rsivivility.

59
00:12:40.609 --> 00:12:45.740
Next time then. Thank you sent
from the first half.


60
00:12:45.823 --> 00:12:50.953
- You owe me, Ax.
- Can I borrow my debt?


61
00:12:53.831 --> 00:12:57.501
"Chen Manin Karaoke Club."
Is it a tough destination?


62
00:12:57.585 --> 00:13:01.756
Come and see for yourself. Are
the city's best blues club.


63
00:13:01.839 --> 00:13:07.053
- And the only one.
- It's true. K yd  n at the same time.


64
00:13:07.219 --> 00:13:11.432
Sehs is fit. Do it so.
Thanks brother.


65
00:13:11.515 --> 00:13:15.603
Nhdn.

66
00:13:41.712 --> 00:13:47.051
Hey, boy. What is your name?

67
00:13:47.134 --> 00:13:50.429
H n has been watching you all morning.

68
00:13:50.513 --> 00:13:54.141
H n never responds,
when I talk to her.


69
00:13:54.225 --> 00:13:58.604
- His name is Wai.
- I was hoping to hear it.


70
00:13:59.897 --> 00:14:03.609
H n can not.

71
00:14:03.693 --> 00:14:07.071
- He can not talk.
- Why not?


72
00:14:07.154 --> 00:14:12.410
It is a very good family.
H nen is ns  j i ty tt m ksi-


73
00:14:12.493 --> 00:14:18.583
- and started to drink. We felt cold
the murderer before you come.


74
00:14:20.084 --> 00:14:24.630
Yhten  y n
the bandits came to their home.


75
00:14:24.714 --> 00:14:28.968
They kidnapped their sister
while being absent.


76
00:14:29.051 --> 00:14:32.722
Wain  iti tried to
est   heit -

77
00:14:32.805 --> 00:14:37.101
- and the robbers murmured
Wain's talking.


78
00:14:37.184 --> 00:14:42.899
Mong LAN jengeill  has too much power.
No one can stop there.


79
00:14:55.578 --> 00:15:00.541
Ax, hoping to wait.

80
00:15:16.432 --> 00:15:21.062
Please, I need more time!
I'm not in the end!


81
00:15:21.145 --> 00:15:24.357
I think you are.

82
00:15:37.787 --> 00:15:43.167
You know why the guards
do you have any fish, Mr. Li?


83
00:15:43.251 --> 00:15:48.840
They are looking at mosquitoes.
Natural pest control.


84
00:15:48.923 --> 00:15:54.762
- Your luck just needs to be.
- It was in the worse direction.


85
00:15:58.349 --> 00:16:05.064
A bad gambler is heaven,
when the house does not spend more money on it.


86
00:16:05.148 --> 00:16:09.318
When you are more valuable
warning example_.


87
00:16:09.402 --> 00:16:12.572
Min  ask! You can not kill me!

88
00:16:12.697 --> 00:16:16.492
I got something
your master Qmom!


89
00:16:16.617 --> 00:16:19.662
H n does not need you
than for fish food.


90
00:16:20.913 --> 00:16:26.043
- It's a good thing for a woman ...
- Qmom has enough wives, Li.


91
00:16:26.127 --> 00:16:31.466
- H nt  is not somebody interested in the village.
- I know that Qmom is a believer.


92
00:16:31.591 --> 00:16:35.762
That girl, Tara, it's impossible
and knows some unique things.


93
00:16:35.845 --> 00:16:39.724
And h nell 
is the power to cure!

94
00:16:48.066 --> 00:16:50.818
Seh n n hd  n.

95
00:16:52.153 --> 00:16:55.198
Seh n n hd  n.

96
00:19:00.865 --> 00:19:05.703
I love the flesh of meat,
before I put it into food.


97
00:19:08.289 --> 00:19:11.709
Mr. Li, Mr. Li.

98
00:19:13.544 --> 00:19:17.006
Let's talk about it from Taras.

99
00:19:28.601 --> 00:19:32.063
I can tell you absolutely!

100
00:19:32.146 --> 00:19:37.944
- H nest  is hy ty . Pidet  n h net.
- No map. The map is p  ss ni.


101
00:19:39.487 --> 00:19:43.867
Are you so smart that you can pit
on the map?


102
00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:48.746
Should I then forgive my debt,
Mr?


103
00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:54.377
If you do this well,
you owe it to me.


104
00:19:57.255 --> 00:20:01.301
Thanks thanks!

105
00:20:04.762 --> 00:20:07.932
Do you think,
is that girl really h n?


106
00:20:12.437 --> 00:20:15.690
Of course there is more.

107
00:20:17.609 --> 00:20:22.155
Follow h nt
and bring the woman to me.


108
00:20:22.238 --> 00:20:25.325
Treat everyone on the road.

109
00:20:26.951 --> 00:20:30.163
Your prayers are fulfilled.

110
00:20:34.876 --> 00:20:39.464
It's not a prayer. It's a curse.

111
00:21:15.291 --> 00:21:19.546
I challenge you to the battle
till death!


112
00:21:19.629 --> 00:21:24.259
If you deny it, 
I have to kill you.

113
00:21:41.192 --> 00:21:46.781
I will give you your duel.
Your spirit.


114
00:21:46.865 --> 00:21:51.327
But I guarantee,
so that you do not repeat the same way.


115
00:22:35.664 --> 00:22:41.378
- What is your name, brother?
- The name is Qiu. Qiu Wenliang.


116
00:22:42.921 --> 00:22:47.425
About a good fighter
should not fight about v h st .


117
00:22:48.593 --> 00:22:54.849
You are the one who pays the goods to Shang
without paying penni k  n.


118
00:22:54.933 --> 00:23:01.022
I know Mr Shang with his family
very. They are yours.


119
00:23:01.106 --> 00:23:06.069
I pay my grandchild's grandchild
and I care for her family.


120
00:23:06.152 --> 00:23:08.571
But Shang is a proud man-

121
00:23:08.697 --> 00:23:13.243
- so for the year,
when passing the p


122
00:23:13.326 --> 00:23:19.291
- I take v h n fruit, vegetables or
baking to make her face shrivel.


123
00:23:19.374 --> 00:23:23.461
Min'm Mrs. Shang!

124
00:23:23.545 --> 00:23:26.798
Without h nt
we'd be dead times ago.


125
00:23:29.843 --> 00:23:33.888
I'm sorry to apologize.

126
00:23:33.972 --> 00:23:40.979
Negative words are a burden like
the poison. It does not take its own el m  ns .


127
00:23:41.062 --> 00:23:47.611
- How can I credit my mistake?
- Make the most of your sleeping pants.


128
00:23:47.694 --> 00:23:53.909
Bring it to the highest level
and the Levites fall down in the midst of the wind.


129
00:23:53.992 --> 00:24:00.165
Then return one week later
recaptured them back into the cage.


130
00:24:00.248 --> 00:24:04.127
Sifu, take me for a pupil.

131
00:24:06.630 --> 00:24:11.009
If you are my student, be t m
your first lesson.


132
00:26:24.434 --> 00:26:27.145
Take care of it!

133
00:26:49.167 --> 00:26:50.794
Good company.

134
00:26:55.382 --> 00:26:58.385
l  pelk  . Viel.

135
00:27:11.523 --> 00:27:16.486
Sau. Sau. One more patient.

136
00:27:28.832 --> 00:27:32.461
As it happens, he can not
straighten your neck.


137
00:27:32.544 --> 00:27:37.090
I'm trying to get an easier storm.

138
00:27:41.511 --> 00:27:46.933
- Now do you feel Milt??
- Is it better?


139
00:27:58.945 --> 00:28:03.784
What happened, Wai?
What is it? Tell me what's h t n .


140
00:28:03.867 --> 00:28:09.623
The goddess took the knife!
H n plans to kill itsens !


141
00:28:09.706 --> 00:28:15.671
Take me to her. min
I'll help. Come on, go to her.


142
00:28:37.067 --> 00:28:39.987
Is!

143
00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:44.741
Is , please!

144
00:28:51.623 --> 00:28:56.420
Brother, please ask.
T m  is not the answer.


145
00:28:56.503 --> 00:29:01.466
- You do not know what.
- Tell me then. You can tell me.


146
00:29:06.388 --> 00:29:10.601
I do not earn money,
but I can not die -

147
00:29:10.726 --> 00:29:14.771
- to fight against it
and do it now!


148
00:29:18.066 --> 00:29:23.071
Courage is for the past.
He needs you and loves you.


149
00:29:23.196 --> 00:29:27.367
- I want to die!
- Forget gone. Because of your baby.


150
00:29:27.451 --> 00:29:31.371
I'm not a coward!
Min  prove it!


151
00:29:33.373 --> 00:29:36.210
I'll kill you first and then myself!

152
00:29:36.293 --> 00:29:40.422
Kill me. I give my spirit,
that you can do it for yourself.


153
00:30:18.293 --> 00:30:22.673
Forgive me!

154
00:30:42.109 --> 00:30:47.865
H n likes flowers. H n says,
That's the likes of flowers. H n pit   n ist .


155
00:31:45.381 --> 00:31:50.511
- Who are you?
- I'm non-existence. I am the universe.


156
00:31:50.594 --> 00:31:56.975
I emptiness. I have the nature of light,
born and immortal.


157
00:31:57.059 --> 00:32:00.646
You've been kidding for a while ago.

158
00:32:00.729 --> 00:32:03.816
From the point of
pain and the great curiosity.

159
00:32:05.943 --> 00:32:09.071
You will soon be on a crossroads.

160
00:32:09.154 --> 00:32:13.659
You have the opportunity to save them many,
you missed before.


161
00:32:15.994 --> 00:32:19.748
Sinby you are the only one.

162
00:32:19.832 --> 00:32:24.962
- Why are you here?
- You'll come to me.


163
00:32:48.902 --> 00:32:51.572
Hey.

164
00:33:03.834 --> 00:33:09.006
Sifu, Mr. Yuen
has come to meet you.


165
00:33:09.089 --> 00:33:13.260
We're already stuck.
Can I come tomorrow?


166
00:33:13.344 --> 00:33:17.723
- I do not think so, Sifu.
- Good.


167
00:33:25.272 --> 00:33:31.028
I'm sorry that we are struggling with it
myhn. We have come from far.


168
00:33:32.488 --> 00:33:35.574
K yk   sis  n.

169
00:33:38.911 --> 00:33:43.123
Come sit down.

170
00:33:46.126 --> 00:33:50.756
I have lived in the village for three years,
not once have come to the k ym.


171
00:33:50.839 --> 00:33:55.844
- Something to bother you.
- I've heard of you a lot of things.


172
00:33:57.638 --> 00:34:00.099
Like?

173
00:34:00.182 --> 00:34:07.064
- You liked the humorous people.
- That's a long time.


174
00:34:07.147 --> 00:34:12.570
Although I have some money,
I am powerless in certain cases.


175
00:34:12.653 --> 00:34:18.868
- What do you think, brother?
- We have lost our children.


176
00:34:18.951 --> 00:34:24.623
Young girls. seven
during the last two years.


177
00:34:24.707 --> 00:34:29.628
Yesterday, the eighth went missing.

178
00:34:29.753 --> 00:34:34.383
I have three girls.
Two youngsters are t ss .


179
00:34:34.466 --> 00:34:39.847
- The oldest daughter in the world?
- Two of them disappeared two days ago.


180
00:34:39.930 --> 00:34:44.643
Tara! Welcome, value a guest.

181
00:34:44.727 --> 00:34:48.105
A guest or a prisoner?

182
00:34:48.189 --> 00:34:51.442
Sill  is not a measure of whatsoever.

183
00:34:51.525 --> 00:34:54.862
Come with me
sin  you will finally sleep in peace.


184
00:34:54.945 --> 00:35:01.118
Unlike the son you dreamed of
are t ynn  scorpions.


185
00:35:01.202 --> 00:35:04.663
Tara is exceptional.

186
00:35:05.873 --> 00:35:10.085
The whole village has always tried
hide and protect h nt .


187
00:35:10.169 --> 00:35:12.338
Mill  way extraordinary?

188
00:35:12.421 --> 00:35:18.344
Tara, your eyes are magic powers.

189
00:35:18.427 --> 00:35:21.931
Tell. Mit  n et?

190
00:35:22.014 --> 00:35:25.726
When he was a baby,
I noticed his gift.


191
00:35:25.810 --> 00:35:29.605
He can say with his
words that rain will come.

192
00:35:29.688 --> 00:35:32.942
The light of the light
is shining with the light.

193
00:35:33.025 --> 00:35:39.490
If your heart is so black,
why are your walls worse than whites?


194
00:35:39.615 --> 00:35:43.285
I'm up to syntymstni
you curse the curse.


195
00:35:43.369 --> 00:35:47.331
The whole world is
in my eyes gray-


196
00:35:47.414 --> 00:35:50.918
- with the only exception of reds
splashes into white walls.


197
00:35:51.001 --> 00:35:55.756
Qmom is powerful, but h net
is cursed with a special illness.


198
00:35:55.840 --> 00:36:01.887
It can not be used in the sun.
H nen has to live in his fortress.


199
00:36:01.971 --> 00:36:04.932
Despite all my strengths,

200
00:36:05.015 --> 00:36:08.602
- I've got to be a prisoner
the walls of the walls!


201
00:36:08.686 --> 00:36:14.859
Tara, sin ... Sinby you can release me
from the chains.


202
00:36:14.942 --> 00:36:19.071
Do you think he is a girl?
can improve h net?


203
00:36:19.155 --> 00:36:24.118
The evil of Qmom spreads like a disease.
He can walk, whatever he wants.


204
00:36:24.201 --> 00:36:28.706
More young girls are kidnapped
and deprived of their homes.


205
00:36:28.789 --> 00:36:33.919
My people have lost hope.

206
00:36:34.003 --> 00:36:39.800
You get your share of everything I have.
Get what you want.


207
00:36:39.884 --> 00:36:46.932
I know how to understand and feel
it grieved its origin ...


208
00:36:48.225 --> 00:36:52.021
- ... but I took the oath.
- I got gold and earth.


209
00:36:52.104 --> 00:36:57.276
- It's not about money. I do not want money.
- But you are the only one!


210
00:37:00.946 --> 00:37:04.867
You are the only one I know,
who can do it.


211
00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:08.621
I do not know what you want.

212
00:37:08.704 --> 00:37:13.292
But I know what you do not want.

213
00:37:13.459 --> 00:37:17.380
You did not give me a choice.

214
00:37:18.798 --> 00:37:25.096
Take tyttreni, because I am quite
I'm sure I'm not coming alive.


215
00:37:25.221 --> 00:37:29.183
Is!

216
00:37:29.266 --> 00:37:31.686
l  me!

217
00:37:33.979 --> 00:37:37.525
Pid  mieless , Tara.

218
00:37:37.608 --> 00:37:41.779
You never p  se ever.

219
00:37:41.862 --> 00:37:44.865
Et t ss  el m ss .

220
00:38:12.685 --> 00:38:18.024
- Take the girls home. I'm looking for a girl.
- Thank you.


221
00:38:18.149 --> 00:38:24.363
lk   itkek .
T m  is Tara.


222
00:38:24.447 --> 00:38:28.743
Remember to ignite the incense of yours.

223
00:38:32.997 --> 00:38:38.544
- Mit  h n meant there?
- The goddess died just a year ago.


224
00:38:40.004 --> 00:38:45.843
- How did he wonder if he knew?
- Why would not he know?


225
00:38:45.927 --> 00:38:48.346
Well go.

226
00:38:48.429 --> 00:38:52.266
Kind of incense
to expel evil.


227
00:38:52.350 --> 00:38:59.148
Did you know that I killed a woman?

228
00:39:20.753 --> 00:39:24.048
Hey, little girl.
Come on, you get candy.


229
00:39:24.131 --> 00:39:28.219
Go away! I do
not want with you! No!

230
00:39:35.017 --> 00:39:41.023
Get out of here! Help! Help!

231
00:39:41.107 --> 00:39:45.945
The girl was lost.
We were just going to go home.


232
00:39:52.410 --> 00:39:59.500
What's hot? In the border town
there is quite a reputation


233
00:39:59.584 --> 00:40:04.130
- murderers, rapists,
drug addicts and drug addicts.


234
00:40:04.213 --> 00:40:09.719
What are your groups?
Are the kidnappings your thing?


235
00:40:28.988 --> 00:40:34.368
The greatest evil
is to hurt the children.


236
00:40:34.452 --> 00:40:37.538
Did you know what I did before
did I take kidnapping?


237
00:40:37.622 --> 00:40:42.502
- No. What did you do?
- I was a hired triad.


238
00:40:42.585 --> 00:40:45.213
You're the one
kung-fuu idiots-


239
00:40:45.296 --> 00:40:50.134
- who believe that everything is real
the force is based on a spiritual foundation.


240
00:40:50.259 --> 00:40:53.221
Min, I learned kung-fu
to kill.


241
00:40:53.304 --> 00:41:00.103
My people are always stronger,
because we focus on one thing.


242
00:41:00.186 --> 00:41:06.526
Your false spirituality is cross-
interfere with your physical technology.


243
00:41:07.860 --> 00:41:11.072
You're not helping the downline.

244
00:41:31.759 --> 00:41:37.014
Meid n kung-fu is a very good kung-fu.
Come on. I'll teach you one thing.


245
00:41:40.059 --> 00:41:43.813
Good kung-fun.

246
00:42:17.847 --> 00:42:24.020
Mr Hou, you understand me
had long been in Lei Shen's doctrine.


247
00:42:25.646 --> 00:42:30.485
You are quite active and well-known
martial arts circles, right?


248
00:42:30.568 --> 00:42:36.032
That's right, Master Chen Man.
What then?


249
00:42:36.115 --> 00:42:42.664
I mean,
that our firm has a certain reputation


250
00:42:42.747 --> 00:42:47.835
- and we only serve high-
class and demanding customers.


251
00:42:47.919 --> 00:42:50.672
I can not accept your excuse

252
00:42:50.755 --> 00:42:55.927
- especially if you went
lying to our ladies.


253
00:42:56.010 --> 00:43:01.766
You should know that they are
my vow and my protection.


254
00:43:01.849 --> 00:43:05.770
mm  steal from me!
H n took my money -


255
00:43:05.895 --> 00:43:09.732
- and the ring,
which was a family calamity!

256
00:43:09.857 --> 00:43:13.236
Mr Hou.

257
00:43:13.319 --> 00:43:16.322
We have been in the field
for a while.


258
00:43:16.406 --> 00:43:22.412
It is not worthless for a worthless joke
causes a scene. Ket  interested?


259
00:43:22.495 --> 00:43:28.209
- I am interested in!
- Shut up! You are my territory.


260
00:43:28.293 --> 00:43:31.546
T  ll  m
 r  n min !

261
00:43:49.063 --> 00:43:52.108
Get away!

262
00:43:59.949 --> 00:44:04.162
I want to ask
just one thing, Mei Ling.

263
00:44:04.287 --> 00:44:08.625
Do you steal Mr. Hula?

264
00:44:13.463 --> 00:44:16.341
I steal.

265
00:44:16.424 --> 00:44:21.012
- Why?
- I have a daughter.


266
00:44:21.095 --> 00:44:25.225
- What's the matter?
- Seven years old.


267
00:44:25.308 --> 00:44:28.978
H nell  is leukemia.

268
00:44:29.062 --> 00:44:33.691
I syvlt the northern mountains.

269
00:44:33.775 --> 00:44:39.864
The disease has seemed to be cured
with the best care-


270
00:44:39.948 --> 00:44:44.369
- but you can get better
to the hospital, he will die.


271
00:44:44.452 --> 00:44:47.497
Please be kind and forgive me.

272
00:44:48.665 --> 00:44:51.125
Min  I believe in you.

273
00:45:34.252 --> 00:45:40.967
With the money you need to keep it
lack of lack of freedom.


274
00:45:41.050 --> 00:45:46.222
Take care of the  l k  en
never leave it alive.


275
00:45:49.225 --> 00:45:53.438
Remember that either
how can i do any-


276
00:45:53.521 --> 00:45:58.193
- and no matter how difficult it is
anyway, never to steal.


277
00:45:58.276 --> 00:46:01.446
Make your case a good example.

278
00:47:09.973 --> 00:47:14.811
Dear gentlemen,
let me make a summary:


279
00:47:14.894 --> 00:47:18.106
Each of your real estate properties
can produce 300,000-


280
00:47:18.231 --> 00:47:22.902
- and you are currently under construction

281
00:47:22.986 --> 00:47:26.406
A golden opportunity.

282
00:47:29.159 --> 00:47:32.370
Golden?

283
00:47:32.454 --> 00:47:35.332
Enp  believe.

284
00:47:35.415 --> 00:47:41.546
The purest gold is se-

285
00:47:41.630 --> 00:47:48.595
- get the latest information.

286
00:47:48.678 --> 00:47:55.435
I've heard that the subsoil
is poisoned by poison.


287
00:47:59.356 --> 00:48:05.028
So badly, it does not grow much
there is no such thing as a cocktail.


288
00:48:05.153 --> 00:48:11.701
You just try to find a scapegoat.
Unless you have anything else, the door is over there.


289
00:48:20.794 --> 00:48:23.922
Mr. Chen.

290
00:48:24.005 --> 00:48:29.261
Mr. Ax is out.
It is urgent to do so.


291
00:48:32.472 --> 00:48:37.602
When I invited you to sleep, I thought,
that we only play music-


292
00:48:37.686 --> 00:48:40.689
- Let's get a couple of glasses
and we would have an evening.


293
00:48:44.067 --> 00:48:47.237
It is not easy
for Qmom to do this.

294
00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:54.077
- Is Tara even confident there?
- I know that he is.


295
00:48:54.202 --> 00:48:59.082
- Pit  k  trust you blindly, brother?
- Kyll . Pane braced me.


296
00:49:02.085 --> 00:49:08.550
- So you finally came to debt your debt?
- That's right, brother.


297
00:49:17.309 --> 00:49:21.479
Guests at this MYT am ready for anything.

298
00:49:23.064 --> 00:49:28.695
"The death of a thousand squints."
You have remembered to sharpen.


299
00:49:28.820 --> 00:49:34.284
- Once a month. Sneaky habit.
- You can not get rid of it.


300
00:49:35.410 --> 00:49:38.997
Great. Thank you.

301
00:49:43.251 --> 00:49:48.423
I only know Qmom's reputation.
You are in the same field in the city.


302
00:49:48.507 --> 00:49:54.513
- What's wrong with hobbies?
- Drug and human trafficking, tightening.


303
00:49:54.638 --> 00:49:59.184
It sounds silly as you like
anyway.


304
00:49:59.267 --> 00:50:04.397
Which can turn out to be hard.

305
00:50:04.481 --> 00:50:08.693
That's why we need to get a job
the right people and the right people.


306
00:50:23.625 --> 00:50:25.961
I know you're sin, Infidel.

307
00:50:26.044 --> 00:50:30.841
- How is it going to happen?
- Fine, but a new duo would be worth it.


308
00:50:39.975 --> 00:50:43.270
Why is the picture t kkii?

309
00:50:43.353 --> 00:50:48.024
- Darius hurts like a rocker.
- Ent  then?


310
00:50:48.108 --> 00:50:54.448
H n only counts
hot mittens and pitsalbeats.


311
00:50:54.531 --> 00:50:59.202
- Does the old gang get together again?
- Silt  n ytt  .


312
00:51:09.045 --> 00:51:14.009
- When are you paying your debt to Mr Wong?
- Point!


313
00:51:16.887 --> 00:51:20.182
Pitsal-watts do not, of course,
when there is a need.


314
00:51:38.241 --> 00:51:43.622
Ax! Wait a moment.
There is a loud noise.


315
00:52:00.305 --> 00:52:03.183
Ax?

316
00:52:03.266 --> 00:52:07.479
Oh, hey. Not that special, commanding.

317
00:52:07.562 --> 00:52:11.149
Normip iv  t iss .

318
00:52:13.443 --> 00:52:16.697
Selv. Come on.

319
00:52:19.116 --> 00:52:25.956
Sifu. We were on a short break
and we came to meet you.


320
00:52:26.039 --> 00:52:29.876
You've learned kung-fun well-

321
00:52:30.002 --> 00:52:35.882
- but in your lying
is another improvement.


322
00:52:35.966 --> 00:52:40.679
Sifu, have you been
recently been healthy?


323
00:52:40.762 --> 00:52:45.183
No complaints,
but when the road is less frequent,


324
00:52:45.267 --> 00:52:51.523
- it is v ist m tt
in the offspring and thistles.


325
00:52:51.606 --> 00:52:56.236
The road p   is unknown.
The length of my trip can not be known.


326
00:52:56.320 --> 00:53:02.367
Understandably, the mind is unlimited
but the body is limited.


327
00:53:02.451 --> 00:53:09.291
But let me glance at me,
you will share our wisdom for a long time.


328
00:53:32.272 --> 00:53:36.610
Sifu, I wanted to ask teilt
er st  thing.


329
00:53:36.735 --> 00:53:43.784
Why have you been so happy with Axelle
but so hard for me-


330
00:53:43.867 --> 00:53:49.331
- even though I have been your students min
decades, until the smallest?


331
00:53:49.414 --> 00:53:52.042
Am I doing something wrong?

332
00:53:53.502 --> 00:53:57.839
We're going to be stricter
to our most deprived.


333
00:54:00.801 --> 00:54:05.305
Sifu, min  en ymm rr .

334
00:54:05.389 --> 00:54:07.849
You have not known t t  -

335
00:54:07.933 --> 00:54:11.228
- but you're my son.

336
00:54:14.565 --> 00:54:16.984
Sifu ...

337
00:54:17.067 --> 00:54:20.279
What did you say?

338
00:54:20.362 --> 00:54:23.115
Am I your son?

339
00:54:25.450 --> 00:54:29.621
Why did not you just tell me now?

340
00:54:31.415 --> 00:54:38.172
My principle has always been
grab the right moment.


341
00:54:38.297 --> 00:54:44.720
You have always been a mere pupil, and min
I always waited at the instant tt


342
00:54:44.803 --> 00:54:46.972
-boy.

343
00:55:12.122 --> 00:55:16.084
T ss k  whole party?
Only the three of us?


344
00:55:38.273 --> 00:55:42.653
- Hollywood. P  sit to come.
- Hello, k ril s.


345
00:55:42.736 --> 00:55:48.659
- What does music belong to?
- Just shit Motown closed.


346
00:55:48.742 --> 00:55:52.704
Eik h n go to the bomber talk.

347
00:56:00.087 --> 00:56:05.175
You have to, because you think you are
owe me. You do not have to pay.


348
00:56:05.300 --> 00:56:11.306
But you owe it to yourself for years
during the period of the war.


349
00:56:11.390 --> 00:56:14.852
I do not know
what you mean, but ...

350
00:56:14.935 --> 00:56:21.275
Min  I came because Chen promised me
the open bar bar is over.


351
00:56:24.069 --> 00:56:28.949
We're off to Qmom's p  majaan.
T m  is my only picture h nest .


352
00:56:29.032 --> 00:56:32.870
H n is not an object,
but he's a tricky gambler.


353
00:56:32.995 --> 00:56:36.582
T m  is looking for a woman,
early twenties.


354
00:56:37.875 --> 00:56:43.881
He may be in prison in the basement of the club.
We're going to save h nt .


355
00:56:43.964 --> 00:56:49.011
Chen Man's protection will be explained,
my fantastic little brother.


356
00:56:49.094 --> 00:56:53.390
Infidel, try to acquire
the exact drawing of the place.


357
00:56:53.474 --> 00:56:57.269
Ying Ying, go inside
dressed as a customer.


358
00:56:57.353 --> 00:57:00.230
You can play sexually,
according to your mind.


359
00:57:00.314 --> 00:57:05.569
Hollywood and Scarecrow, list it now
our equipment and mit  are missing.


360
00:57:05.652 --> 00:57:11.116
I ask a lot, but we are
for the righteous cause.


361
00:57:12.368 --> 00:57:15.913
One question, broidi.

362
00:57:15.996 --> 00:57:18.582
What's the miracle name Qmom is?

363
00:57:18.666 --> 00:57:23.587
I do not feel like it, but I can do it
do not hesitate to contact me, so please ask me.


364
00:57:26.507 --> 00:57:30.094
Let's go.

365
00:57:44.400 --> 00:57:47.695
Our forehead is four men.

366
00:57:47.820 --> 00:57:51.448
Third from left, 
Black Claw Ma -

367
00:57:51.532 --> 00:57:54.827
- is Qmom's first striker.

368
00:57:54.910 --> 00:57:57.871
Why does h nen nimens  sound familiar?

369
00:57:57.955 --> 00:58:01.333
H n was not previously in Qmom's queues.

370
00:58:01.458 --> 00:58:04.420
H n is in the
same school as we do.

371
00:58:04.503 --> 00:58:08.882
H n has got the same
kung-fu training like we, brother.


372
00:58:08.966 --> 00:58:13.095
Eri el m ss
we might have been able to be yst vi .


373
00:58:13.220 --> 00:58:17.641
- But we do not, at least not yet.
- What do you mean?


374
00:58:17.725 --> 00:58:22.062
Black Claw But if nobody knows
Qmom is in perfect detail.


375
00:58:22.146 --> 00:58:25.190
Do you really think so?
exchangeable side?


376
00:58:28.736 --> 00:58:34.783
There are two types of dogs. Others remain
until the end, to the owner loyal-


377
00:58:34.867 --> 00:58:39.371
- and others bite the owner
at the next opportunity.


378
00:58:39.455 --> 00:58:42.875
Pit   knows,
there is a different kind of dog.


379
00:59:05.105 --> 00:59:09.401
- P iv  , Master Ax.
- P iv  .


380
00:59:09.485 --> 00:59:14.573
- Do you want to create a mysterious clock?
- It makes me safe.


381
00:59:14.657 --> 00:59:19.286
It tells you whether the door is good or not
evil. What do you mean to be t n  n?


382
00:59:22.248 --> 00:59:26.585
- Kipul  kett ?
- Yeah, but not me.


383
00:59:32.842 --> 00:59:38.889
- It's rabid.
- I remember you now. Ax.


384
00:59:38.973 --> 00:59:42.935
Liikanimeltn
"Mongkok's demon demolisher".


385
00:59:43.060 --> 00:59:48.440
Mongkok is in Hong Kong and we are
Mong Laa, somewhere in the border region-


386
00:59:48.524 --> 00:59:53.529
- Laos, Cambodia and Thailand
vliss. We're all in there.


387
00:59:53.612 --> 00:59:56.782
But I remember you.

388
00:59:56.866 --> 01:00:00.494
Black Claw Ma, naama menneisyydest .

389
01:00:00.578 --> 01:00:04.665
You were a wolf then
and you are a multer too now.


390
01:00:04.748 --> 01:00:08.794
Your words hurt me deeply.

391
01:00:08.878 --> 01:00:12.381
Do you really think your teacher
Did you get all your secrets?


392
01:00:12.465 --> 01:00:17.761
I'm just plain country boy
without its greater ambition.


393
01:00:17.845 --> 01:00:23.684
I do not expect to get the big champions
techniques. I'm not worthy of it.


394
01:00:23.767 --> 01:00:28.230
Quit reminders, Ax.
Why did you ask me to do it?


395
01:00:28.314 --> 01:00:34.278
When I got you last, you seemed to be
p   Qmomin perseess .


396
01:00:34.361 --> 01:00:39.784
I started thinking, would you like to change
to a better place.


397
01:00:39.867 --> 01:00:46.332
- Do you offer me a job?
- More exhaustion plans.


398
01:00:46.415 --> 01:00:50.836
Sin  t ss  you are in need,
Ax.


399
01:00:50.920 --> 01:00:56.926
- And then I need it.
- Then I went.


400
01:01:00.346 --> 01:01:03.015
Would not you solve this by speaking?

401
01:01:37.425 --> 01:01:40.678
Help! The fight stops!

402
01:01:52.940 --> 01:01:56.068
It's enough.  lk 
 tapelko en  .

403
01:01:56.193 --> 01:02:00.614
Call the ambulance. I pay for everything.
No, honey, brother.


404
01:02:01.949 --> 01:02:05.244
Even ...

405
01:02:23.554 --> 01:02:25.931
Infidel, what did you find out?

406
01:02:26.015 --> 01:02:31.020
Qmom is known as a martial arts master.

407
01:02:31.103 --> 01:02:35.524
As a champion he did not use a gun,
but h nen jengins  k ytt  .


408
01:02:35.608 --> 01:02:37.943
They are heavily armed.

409
01:02:38.027 --> 01:02:42.949
We strive to keep you safe.
Cold and calm.


410
01:02:43.032 --> 01:02:47.787
If you hear the word "hard"
then go tough.


411
01:02:49.497 --> 01:02:52.708
The club is similar in nature.

412
01:03:12.561 --> 01:03:15.856
Only a few and selected
p  sev t sis.


413
01:03:15.940 --> 01:03:22.446
Pitso be either rich enough,
beautiful or influential.


414
01:03:28.494 --> 01:03:32.623
Calculated
divided into three categories.


415
01:03:32.707 --> 01:03:38.921
White pies for big dance-
on the floor, black on the other side.


416
01:03:42.091 --> 01:03:46.762
The red bracelet gets
free p  sys for the whole club-


417
01:03:46.846 --> 01:03:51.642
- including private rooms
to enjoy their dudes.


418
01:03:51.726 --> 01:03:53.769
How did you not get red?

419
01:03:53.853 --> 01:03:57.189
I did not get one.

420
01:03:57.273 --> 01:03:58.900
I got two.

421
01:04:16.292 --> 01:04:21.464
In each room p ivyst
five guards.


422
01:04:21.547 --> 01:04:24.759
Everyone at the dance floor
has its own bartender.


423
01:04:24.842 --> 01:04:28.804
Each has its own sheikkerins .

424
01:04:31.724 --> 01:04:38.439
I tried to follow three types, but
they were led to private premises.


425
01:04:38.523 --> 01:04:41.734
Heill  had strange tattoos.

426
01:04:48.866 --> 01:04:51.577
H n writes the word "fire".

427
01:04:51.702 --> 01:04:58.501
The tribal symbol of Taran is n kyl st .
H nen is ll  n is similar.


428
01:05:02.922 --> 01:05:07.510
- Fire and wood.
- It proves that you have to.


429
01:05:07.593 --> 01:05:13.349
Baihuu is a private show tomorrow,
that is, v ke  is less vague.


430
01:05:13.432 --> 01:05:16.144
Meill  has just two bracelets.

431
01:05:16.227 --> 01:05:19.313
Hollywood and mins are going
including the front or rear door.


432
01:05:19.397 --> 01:05:22.692
My student counts Ying Ying
and Infidel.


433
01:05:22.775 --> 01:05:28.281
N m  three places are best suited
M4.


434
01:05:28.364 --> 01:05:34.620
Two washrooms with jars.
We put guns and ammunition into them.


435
01:05:34.704 --> 01:05:37.498
It can work.

436
01:05:37.623 --> 01:05:42.211
- Does Milt's sound like that? Do you have any questions?
- I have one question.


437
01:05:42.295 --> 01:05:48.843
- What model do we leave?
- Shadows inside, rushing out.


438
01:06:05.401 --> 01:06:09.113
To the evil you have been guilty of.

439
01:06:12.116 --> 01:06:16.287
Your Vocabulary is enrichmentless.

440
01:06:16.370 --> 01:06:20.041
Innocent killing.

441
01:06:20.124 --> 01:06:25.338
It is not enough for you to do this
t ynn  pain and k rsimyst ?


442
01:06:25.463 --> 01:06:29.509
Shut your husband.

443
01:06:30.760 --> 01:06:35.223
I was said,
you do not agree with the syllabus.


444
01:06:35.306 --> 01:06:40.937
Based on the above
yours too much.


445
01:06:43.773 --> 01:06:47.694
Even so -

446
01:06:47.777 --> 01:06:51.948
- your language is still united.

447
01:06:53.491 --> 01:06:58.830
You're not sleeping in the
p  t st .

448
01:06:58.913 --> 01:07:04.293
- Tell me what the hell are you waiting for?
- Ehk p  look forward to ...


449
01:07:04.377 --> 01:07:08.172
... that you can cut that knife away.

450
01:07:08.256 --> 01:07:11.634
Maybe you're looking for rescuers.

451
01:07:11.718 --> 01:07:17.724
Mistby speech we are
received a few guests.


452
01:07:30.570 --> 01:07:36.409
N m  etiquette are home-style.

453
01:07:50.089 --> 01:07:54.093
Pid tk  card games?

454
01:08:03.227 --> 01:08:06.272
Tara.

455
01:08:12.070 --> 01:08:15.823
Select a card.

456
01:08:20.787 --> 01:08:23.915
Do not you dare even guess?

457
01:08:58.533 --> 01:09:01.452
No, please! l!

458
01:09:19.637 --> 01:09:21.347
Tara.

459
01:09:25.143 --> 01:09:27.478
Tara.

460
01:09:28.730 --> 01:09:32.358
- One more card?
- That's enough.


461
01:09:36.029 --> 01:09:39.908
I'll give you what you want.

462
01:10:11.648 --> 01:10:15.110
The doorman is the students of Chen Man.

463
01:12:03.468 --> 01:12:07.430
What are the men you are? T m  on
a private event. Come with me.


464
01:13:45.445 --> 01:13:48.990
- Go get some help.
- Do not you need help?


465
01:13:49.074 --> 01:13:52.953
- It's k sky.
- Yeah, sir.


466
01:13:56.831 --> 01:14:00.252
Are you blind-

467
01:14:00.335 --> 01:14:04.047
- or do you hide from me?
things you intend to do?


468
01:16:59.931 --> 01:17:05.562
You know,
what do you mean by t n  n-


469
01:17:05.646 --> 01:17:09.066
- I can take you back.

470
01:17:10.359 --> 01:17:14.529
- And you're gonna miss it.
- Like so?


471
01:18:53.462 --> 01:18:55.505
In other words-

472
01:18:55.589 --> 01:19:00.802
- There is no world we know.
It's gone.


473
01:19:00.886 --> 01:19:04.973
Traditions and values, ethics and morality,
which we inherit from our isilt-


474
01:19:05.057 --> 01:19:10.229
- our fathers,
our ancestors and our masters


475
01:19:10.312 --> 01:19:16.360
- Not just sweeping the pace.
They have almost disappeared.


476
01:19:16.443 --> 01:19:20.239
Asian martial arts
have spread throughout the world,


477
01:19:20.322 --> 01:19:24.451
- but they're threatening
deep, dark disease.


478
01:19:24.535 --> 01:19:29.206
Ercs have been trying to use
strength and knowledge


479
01:19:29.331 --> 01:19:34.211
- does not come to a common good
but to my own bad p  m  riins .


480
01:19:35.629 --> 01:19:40.133
They're unbeatable, drones.

481
01:19:40.217 --> 01:19:43.929
They've broken the chain.

482
01:19:44.012 --> 01:19:47.307
Heidi, who would have the most
precious wisdom made to the


483
01:19:47.391 --> 01:19:51.895
- has been rejected, laughed
and ignored.


484
01:19:52.020 --> 01:19:55.107
We can not do anything else-

485
01:19:55.190 --> 01:20:00.320
- like taking this
kung-fu loving heart-


486
01:20:00.404 --> 01:20:03.866
- give it a light flame
and guard the fire.


487
01:20:03.949 --> 01:20:08.620
I hope black clouds
then v istyv t-


488
01:20:08.704 --> 01:20:11.665
- and a new p
iv  may be possible.

489
01:20:11.748 --> 01:20:16.587
Kung-fu is not just for the Chinese
but to all people -


490
01:20:16.670 --> 01:20:19.590
- like everyone else
martial arts.


491
01:20:19.673 --> 01:20:22.551
Finally,
that I have been honored-


492
01:20:22.634 --> 01:20:28.974
- before the time when the actual
masters have rescued the same land.


493
01:20:29.057 --> 01:20:34.563
I have listened Their words.
They have led us all to do so.


494
01:20:34.646 --> 01:20:41.195
All the people in this room.
If we can devote ourselves to the


495
01:20:41.320 --> 01:20:47.993
- the chain's last uninterrupted
part nursing


496
01:20:48.077 --> 01:20:53.415
- and commit to helping innocent,
weak and weak ...


497
01:20:55.751 --> 01:21:02.466
... and see a sample of n yryydest
and serving the very best ...


498
01:21:04.468 --> 01:21:08.514
... then kung-fu may never be
el   meit  pitemp  n.


499
01:21:08.597 --> 01:21:12.810
All we have to do is t n  n
we speak the words-


500
01:21:12.893 --> 01:21:18.107
- have been worthy of something, no
our prayers have not been useless.


501
01:21:18.190 --> 01:21:22.903
Kippis!

502
01:21:48.929 --> 01:21:54.309
