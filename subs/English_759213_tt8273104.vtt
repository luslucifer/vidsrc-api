00:00:12.878 --> 00:00:14.981
<i>"Dear diary.
I finally got the courage</i>


2
00:00:15.014 --> 00:00:16.948
<i>to write a good-bye letter
to my father.</i>


3
00:00:16.982 --> 00:00:19.619
<i>'Dad, I am thankful
for all you've done for me.</i>


4
00:00:19.652 --> 00:00:22.421
<i>But I can't be afraid for
my physical health anymore.</i>


5
00:00:22.454 --> 00:00:25.324
<i>You don't listen. 
You're lost!</i>

6
00:00:25.357 --> 00:00:27.860
<i>I hope you find peace
and forgive yourself.</i>


7
00:00:27.893 --> 00:00:32.998
<i>I'm sorry, I can't stay here.
Not like this. It's time.</i>


8
00:00:33.032 --> 00:00:37.370
<i>Goodbye. I love you.
I'm fucking out of here.'"</i>


9
00:00:52.084 --> 00:00:55.555
I'm just starting to realize
how much I'm gonna miss my mom.


10
00:01:03.562 --> 00:01:06.398
Do you think it's a good
idea to turn our phones on?


11
00:01:06.431 --> 00:01:07.966
I just wanted to tell her
I'm okay,


12
00:01:07.999 --> 00:01:11.303
- and that I'm sorry...
- Lily!


13
00:01:11.337 --> 00:01:12.605
Okay, you're right.

14
00:01:14.639 --> 00:01:16.442
Is it off?

15
00:01:16.475 --> 00:01:17.943
Neil, I'm not stupid.

16
00:01:20.645 --> 00:01:22.013
Are you serious right now?

17
00:01:22.046 --> 00:01:25.350
You'll get it back
once you start thinking clearly.


18
00:01:56.013 --> 00:01:57.015
Don't.

19
00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:00.719
You told me he didn't hit you.

20
00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.457
It's nothing.

21
00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.892
Get your lazy ass outside now!

22
00:02:06.924 --> 00:02:08.960
Leave me alone.

23
00:02:08.994 --> 00:02:12.398
Look at your daddy
when he's talking to you.


24
00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.000
You're not my dad
and you smell like a cheap beer.


25
00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.906
We said we'd be honest
with each other.


26
00:02:51.602 --> 00:02:52.738
Do we still have water?

27
00:02:54.606 --> 00:02:55.608
No.

28
00:02:57.108 --> 00:02:59.177
How much longer?

29
00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:00.812
Just a little.

30
00:03:06.584 --> 00:03:08.019
This looks like a good place.

31
00:03:08.053 --> 00:03:09.522
For bears, maybe.

32
00:03:11.155 --> 00:03:13.958
You know, I never realized
how much anxiety you have.


33
00:03:13.992 --> 00:03:15.727
You would
if you really knew me.


34
00:03:15.761 --> 00:03:18.163
Stay here.

35
00:03:18.197 --> 00:03:20.700
Let me see if I can
find that river.


36
00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.739
You can pitch the tent
while I'm gone.


37
00:03:26.772 --> 00:03:28.107
I won't be long.

38
00:03:48.125 --> 00:03:49.060
Oh, no.

39
00:03:53.899 --> 00:03:55.868
Neil!

40
00:03:57.835 --> 00:03:59.971
Neil!

41
00:04:15.087 --> 00:04:19.658
I asked you to clean up
the kitchen and what did you do?


42
00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.161
Run off to your room
to write in your fucking diary.


43
00:04:26.531 --> 00:04:29.502
Now maybe we'll get some
actual work done around here.


44
00:04:38.577 --> 00:04:39.512
Neil?

45
00:04:41.647 --> 00:04:42.981
Are you there?

46
00:05:59.024 --> 00:06:02.762
Hello? Is anyone here?

47
00:06:21.947 --> 00:06:23.115
Oh, God.

48
00:06:36.394 --> 00:06:39.097
Hi. Um....

49
00:06:40.298 --> 00:06:41.968
Hello, sir, I
-I need help.

50
00:06:45.671 --> 00:06:47.873
I'm so sorry for banging
on the door like that.


51
00:06:49.974 --> 00:06:53.177
- I was with my boyfriend...
- It's all right. It's all right.


52
00:06:53.211 --> 00:06:54.647
I'm just happy you're safe.

53
00:06:56.882 --> 00:06:58.784
Thanks.
Do you have a phone...


54
00:06:58.817 --> 00:07:03.022
Don't just stand there.
Come inside. Come on.


55
00:07:06.291 --> 00:07:08.661
I'll get you some water.

56
00:07:08.694 --> 00:07:10.963
Thanks. You're very kind.

57
00:07:10.995 --> 00:07:12.130
Can I use your phone?

58
00:07:12.163 --> 00:07:14.332
My boyfriend
probably needs help.


59
00:07:17.769 --> 00:07:18.704
Here.

60
00:07:20.372 --> 00:07:22.808
- I really need to use the phone.
- Here you go.


61
00:07:30.115 --> 00:07:32.685
- Oh...
- I'm so sorry.


62
00:07:32.717 --> 00:07:33.952
I'm not mad.

63
00:07:35.786 --> 00:07:39.825
You stink. You go take a shower,
we'll talk later.


64
00:07:39.858 --> 00:07:40.860
Excuse me?

65
00:07:43.094 --> 00:07:46.330
Um, thank you
for the glass of water,


66
00:07:46.363 --> 00:07:49.199
but I think it's better
if I go now.


67
00:07:49.233 --> 00:07:52.137
Where you're going?
Hey! No, no, wait, wait, wait.


68
00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:53.439
Hey, Come back here.

69
00:07:53.471 --> 00:07:54.972
What is the matter with you?

70
00:07:55.005 --> 00:07:56.375
What do you want from me?

71
00:07:56.408 --> 00:07:57.843
I want you to come inside

72
00:07:57.875 --> 00:07:59.811
so we can have
a normal conversation.


73
00:07:59.844 --> 00:08:01.880
- What?
- I am not gonna say it again!


74
00:08:04.149 --> 00:08:06.118
- Get inside now.
- Okay.


75
00:08:09.387 --> 00:08:11.457
- What do you... Wait...
- Come on. You come.


76
00:08:13.358 --> 00:08:16.362
Oh, God. Stay.

77
00:08:18.462 --> 00:08:21.266
Oh. Goddamn it.

78
00:08:29.106 --> 00:08:30.709
Give me your bag.

79
00:08:32.410 --> 00:08:33.478
Come on.

80
00:08:37.449 --> 00:08:38.383
Sit.

81
00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:42.921
Please.

82
00:08:46.525 --> 00:08:47.927
More water?

83
00:08:52.164 --> 00:08:54.833
You don't understand how serious
my situation is.


84
00:08:54.866 --> 00:08:56.835
Well, you can tell me.

85
00:08:56.868 --> 00:08:59.137
I'm here for you.

86
00:08:59.171 --> 00:09:01.373
There's nothing to tell you.
I don't get it!


87
00:09:01.406 --> 00:09:04.843
- I came here for help and...
- Hey, shh, shh.


88
00:09:04.876 --> 00:09:08.213
- You hear me yelling?
- You were a minute ago.


89
00:09:08.246 --> 00:09:09.481
I'm sorry.

90
00:09:09.513 --> 00:09:11.182
- This is ridiculous.
- No, sit down!


91
00:09:11.215 --> 00:09:13.484
- You can't tell me what to do...
- You... Sit!


92
00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:22.326
- I just wanna go.
- You wanna go.


93
00:09:22.359 --> 00:09:24.329
Well, you can come with me then.
Come on.


94
00:09:24.362 --> 00:09:25.998
- What are you doing?
- Shut up. I don't wanna hear it.


95
00:09:26.031 --> 00:09:27.332
- You are coming with me now.
- You are hurting me.


96
00:09:27.364 --> 00:09:28.834
And you are going in here.

97
00:09:28.867 --> 00:09:31.402
Get in there.
Get in and think about it.


98
00:09:34.439 --> 00:09:37.108
Let me out, you psycho!

99
00:10:27.191 --> 00:10:29.828
Let me out, you psycho.

100
00:11:50.241 --> 00:11:52.177
I've got to get the hell
out of here.


101
00:11:59.751 --> 00:12:01.185
What are you doing?

102
00:12:04.155 --> 00:12:06.358
What were you gonna do
with that?


103
00:12:06.391 --> 00:12:08.593
Get away from me.

104
00:12:08.626 --> 00:12:10.996
Well, I was gonna come down
and let you out.


105
00:12:11.028 --> 00:12:12.530
I was gonna say sorry,
but now


106
00:12:12.564 --> 00:12:15.534
I find you've been messing
around with all my stuff.


107
00:12:18.770 --> 00:12:21.440
Congratulations.
You're grounded.


108
00:13:08.619 --> 00:13:11.589
I thought
you'd be hungry by now.


109
00:13:15.426 --> 00:13:17.195
Sorry I left you down here,

110
00:13:17.228 --> 00:13:18.662
but you left me no choice.

111
00:13:18.695 --> 00:13:20.331
What's going on?

112
00:13:20.364 --> 00:13:22.233
Come upstairs,
we'll get you a shower.


113
00:13:22.267 --> 00:13:24.402
Don't touch me.

114
00:13:24.435 --> 00:13:26.104
I'm not gonna hurt you.

115
00:13:28.105 --> 00:13:29.474
I wanna go find my boyfriend.

116
00:13:29.507 --> 00:13:33.245
Enough with this shit.
You just do as I say.


117
00:13:35.814 --> 00:13:37.516
I'm sorry.

118
00:13:37.549 --> 00:13:42.521
I'm sorry, I... Look...

119
00:13:42.554 --> 00:13:45.791
I'll get you a new sandwich.
We'll sort everything out.


120
00:13:45.824 --> 00:13:47.592
How does that sound?

121
00:13:47.624 --> 00:13:49.360
I can't have you leaving again.

122
00:13:49.393 --> 00:13:50.495
Again?

123
00:13:52.363 --> 00:13:54.800
I can't even talk to you,
for God's sake!


124
00:13:54.833 --> 00:13:59.371
It's okay, honey.
Come here. Give me a hug.


125
00:13:59.403 --> 00:14:02.106
- Leave me alone!
- What is the matter with you?


126
00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:05.276
What's the matter with me? Does
any of this make sense to you?


127
00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:06.777
All right, that is it.

128
00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:09.113
- I'm not playing games.
- What are you doing? Stop!


129
00:14:09.147 --> 00:14:10.281
- Get off me.
- Come with me.


130
00:14:10.315 --> 00:14:12.651
You get in here, now!
In you go.


131
00:14:18.857 --> 00:14:19.791
Hop on!

132
00:14:21.626 --> 00:14:23.127
You're crazy!

133
00:14:23.161 --> 00:14:25.664
- It's time for you to train.
- Train for what?


134
00:14:25.696 --> 00:14:27.498
Can we just try
to make this work?


135
00:14:27.531 --> 00:14:30.835
You promise not to grab me
like that again?


136
00:14:30.868 --> 00:14:32.303
I'm really sorry.

137
00:14:35.607 --> 00:14:37.809
What can I do
to make it right?


138
00:14:37.842 --> 00:14:40.112
Just leave me alone.

139
00:14:45.682 --> 00:14:47.685
I'll give you the weekend.

140
00:14:53.424 --> 00:14:54.726
Goodnight.

141
00:15:28.459 --> 00:15:30.429
Let me out, please.

142
00:15:36.901 --> 00:15:39.371
Let me out, please.

143
00:15:51.449 --> 00:15:52.851
Let me out, please.

144
00:15:58.790 --> 00:16:00.925
Just let me out, please.

145
00:16:02.859 --> 00:16:04.662
It's Sunday.

146
00:16:04.695 --> 00:16:07.331
Sunday is a day of rest.

147
00:16:07.364 --> 00:16:10.201
So how about you save your
strength, stop all the yelling


148
00:16:10.234 --> 00:16:12.336
and accept this is the way
things have to be


149
00:16:12.369 --> 00:16:15.239
I'm not gonna let it happen
again. You're going to win.


150
00:16:15.272 --> 00:16:17.242
I have no idea
what you're talking about.


151
00:16:17.275 --> 00:16:19.211
- Stay focused.
- What am I supposed to win?


152
00:16:19.243 --> 00:16:21.345
- I told you many times.
- Win what? Win what?


153
00:16:21.378 --> 00:16:23.348
We both need a clear mind. Argh!

154
00:16:25.749 --> 00:16:26.884
Enough.

155
00:16:30.454 --> 00:16:31.623
One more day.

156
00:16:35.026 --> 00:16:38.397
Wait. Please. I'm hungry.

157
00:16:39.696 --> 00:16:40.831
I know.

158
00:16:42.432 --> 00:16:45.502
What are you doing?
I asked you to wash the car.


159
00:16:45.536 --> 00:16:47.906
Can I please do it tomorrow?
I just got my period.


160
00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:32.677
Morning.
How was your breakfast?


161
00:18:48.459 --> 00:18:50.594
It's time. Lie down.

162
00:18:52.863 --> 00:18:54.565
I said lie down.

163
00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:58.003
Come on. Come on.
Chop, chop, chop.


164
00:19:04.441 --> 00:19:05.376
Legs up.

165
00:19:16.453 --> 00:19:18.489
We're gonna start
with some sit-ups.


166
00:19:21.625 --> 00:19:23.828
And... one.

167
00:19:24.961 --> 00:19:26.397
That's it.

168
00:19:27.698 --> 00:19:28.767
Two. Come on.

169
00:19:31.602 --> 00:19:33.872
Three. Oh, come on,
you can do. it.


170
00:19:37.441 --> 00:19:38.809
And four.

171
00:19:38.843 --> 00:19:42.781
No. Keep... Look... Stop.
Take a breath.


172
00:19:42.814 --> 00:19:47.185
- Get your lazy ass outside now.
- Leave me alone.


173
00:19:47.218 --> 00:19:48.853
<i>Are you ready to go again?</i>

174
00:19:48.885 --> 00:19:49.853
No.

175
00:19:49.886 --> 00:19:51.455
Yes! Go.

176
00:19:51.488 --> 00:19:52.957
Don't be such a lazy ass.

177
00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:24.855
Fuck you!

178
00:20:26.524 --> 00:20:27.459
Shit!

179
00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:31.628
Okay.

180
00:20:31.661 --> 00:20:33.530
I'm hoping
you've calmed down a bit.


181
00:20:33.564 --> 00:20:35.233
Are you ready
to give it another try?


182
00:20:40.004 --> 00:20:41.539
What's going on?

183
00:20:41.572 --> 00:20:42.507
What?

184
00:20:45.942 --> 00:20:48.846
- Why did you do that?
- I didn't do anything.


185
00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:51.114
You're allowed to touch
the box with your name,


186
00:20:51.148 --> 00:20:52.817
you're not allowed
to touch anything else.


187
00:20:52.850 --> 00:20:53.885
This is all organized.

188
00:20:57.587 --> 00:20:59.490
- What were you trying to do?
- Nothing.


189
00:20:59.524 --> 00:21:02.093
Do you think I'm happy
leaving you down here?


190
00:21:02.125 --> 00:21:04.228
If you'd just behave,
I wouldn't have to.


191
00:21:06.229 --> 00:21:08.700
Look, it's fine, fine.

192
00:21:08.732 --> 00:21:10.801
Let's just do five, huh?

193
00:21:10.834 --> 00:21:14.271
Then we can go upstairs,
we can have a nice dinner.


194
00:21:14.305 --> 00:21:16.507
- Really?
- Yes.


195
00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:18.142
But you have to do
what I want first.


196
00:21:20.777 --> 00:21:23.180
- Okay.
- Okay. Come on.


197
00:21:25.115 --> 00:21:27.251
You just needed motivation. Hmm?

198
00:21:27.285 --> 00:21:28.887
I'll keep that in mind.

199
00:21:31.087 --> 00:21:32.156
And one.

200
00:21:34.792 --> 00:21:35.994
And two.

201
00:21:38.828 --> 00:21:40.130
And three. Come on.

202
00:21:42.999 --> 00:21:44.536
And four.

203
00:21:47.071 --> 00:21:48.940
Oh, never mind.

204
00:21:48.972 --> 00:21:50.941
Wait. I'm trying.

205
00:21:55.145 --> 00:21:58.849
Come upstairs.
I made you something special.


206
00:22:34.719 --> 00:22:37.956
I take it by your reaction
that it's satisfactory?


207
00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:41.825
Have a seat. Hmm?

208
00:23:01.277 --> 00:23:04.882
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
No.


209
00:23:04.914 --> 00:23:06.718
Grace.

210
00:23:11.087 --> 00:23:15.726
We always say grace.
Go on, Katherine.


211
00:23:18.261 --> 00:23:19.964
I thought you were hungry.

212
00:23:28.104 --> 00:23:31.308
Our father who art in heaven.

213
00:23:35.145 --> 00:23:41.118
Thank you for the meal.

214
00:23:41.151 --> 00:23:46.624
Please bless the food
that we are going to...


215
00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:54.931
Going to... To...

216
00:23:54.965 --> 00:23:58.937
I will take that.
Thank you very much.


217
00:24:01.037 --> 00:24:04.409
I don't understand why you are
disrespecting this food.


218
00:24:04.441 --> 00:24:06.844
What, you can't even say grace
properly now?


219
00:24:06.876 --> 00:24:08.278
What are you?
A baby?


220
00:24:08.312 --> 00:24:10.248
I try to do something nice,
you go ahead


221
00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:13.050
and destroy everything.
If you're gonna act like a baby,


222
00:24:13.084 --> 00:24:15.253
you can eat with that.

223
00:24:19.355 --> 00:24:24.061
Don't understand why we can't
have a nice dinner together.


224
00:24:24.094 --> 00:24:26.064
Well, go ahead and eat.

225
00:24:27.965 --> 00:24:29.401
Eat your salad.

226
00:24:37.307 --> 00:24:38.308
What are you doing?

227
00:24:40.111 --> 00:24:42.914
Katherine,
do not throw food on the floor.


228
00:24:42.947 --> 00:24:44.248
What...

229
00:24:46.917 --> 00:24:49.153
- Don't you dare.
- Fuck you!


230
00:24:49.186 --> 00:24:51.723
Hey! You can get back
to the basement.


231
00:24:51.756 --> 00:24:53.490
You gonna disrespect the food?
Get back to the basement.


232
00:24:53.524 --> 00:24:56.094
You go, go. Get out of here.
I don't wanna see you.


233
00:24:56.126 --> 00:24:58.161
Get out of my sight.

234
00:25:21.384 --> 00:25:22.987
Take off your clothes.

235
00:25:24.455 --> 00:25:25.824
Here.

236
00:25:28.258 --> 00:25:29.960
Where do you expect me
to change?


237
00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:32.229
In there.

238
00:25:33.831 --> 00:25:34.966
I'll be waiting.

239
00:25:56.386 --> 00:25:59.389
Hurry up.
We've got a lot to do today.


240
00:26:08.833 --> 00:26:13.036
Wow. You've lost more than a few
pounds since you've been gone.


241
00:26:13.069 --> 00:26:16.206
You're gonna be eating better
from now on.


242
00:26:16.239 --> 00:26:18.876
Oh, don't give me that look.
Come on, hop up.


243
00:26:21.144 --> 00:26:22.512
Okay.

244
00:26:22.546 --> 00:26:24.548
You're gonna go.

245
00:26:24.582 --> 00:26:26.818
You know, five-minute walk,

246
00:26:26.851 --> 00:26:29.487
up here to a five-minute run.

247
00:26:29.519 --> 00:26:31.388
I'll be back in 10 minutes.

248
00:26:59.450 --> 00:27:01.052
Oh.

249
00:27:01.084 --> 00:27:02.519
- Hey, Jeff.
- Hey.


250
00:27:02.553 --> 00:27:04.389
Good to see you. Come on in.

251
00:27:11.961 --> 00:27:13.330
So, what brings you out here?

252
00:27:13.363 --> 00:27:15.065
Well, you don't answer
your phone,


253
00:27:15.098 --> 00:27:16.900
so I had to come see you
myself.


254
00:27:16.933 --> 00:27:19.202
Ah. Hey, you want a cup of tea?

255
00:27:19.236 --> 00:27:22.640
Nah, I'm-I'm gonna go
in a minute.


256
00:27:22.672 --> 00:27:24.909
What do you mean?
You just got here, man.


257
00:27:24.941 --> 00:27:26.276
Come on. Take a seat.

258
00:27:29.246 --> 00:27:31.415
So how is everything?

259
00:27:31.448 --> 00:27:33.618
Everything
is really, really great.


260
00:27:33.651 --> 00:27:35.620
- Yeah?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.


261
00:27:35.652 --> 00:27:37.622
Hey. Guess what?

262
00:27:37.654 --> 00:27:38.989
What?

263
00:27:42.058 --> 00:27:43.493
She's back.

264
00:27:43.526 --> 00:27:45.595
And she started training again.

265
00:27:45.629 --> 00:27:48.532
She's not in the best shape,
but we're gonna get there.


266
00:27:48.565 --> 00:27:50.101
- Who's back?
- Katherine.


267
00:27:53.036 --> 00:27:54.471
Have you stop taking the meds?

268
00:27:57.106 --> 00:28:00.277
Jeff, I'm fine.

269
00:28:00.311 --> 00:28:04.215
God, everything is great, man.
I mean, she's back.


270
00:28:04.248 --> 00:28:06.517
Evan. Have you stopped
taking the meds or not?


271
00:28:08.986 --> 00:28:10.454
Look, I'm just excited.

272
00:28:10.487 --> 00:28:12.355
I've been waiting for this
for this for months...


273
00:28:12.389 --> 00:28:14.125
- Evan, listen.
- We're gonna go for gold.


274
00:28:14.158 --> 00:28:15.927
- Evan, listen, okay?
- If we can reach our goal


275
00:28:15.959 --> 00:28:19.296
- within two months.
- Evan stop. We all love you!


276
00:28:19.330 --> 00:28:21.165
Okay? You know this.

277
00:28:24.701 --> 00:28:26.336
Why did you come out here, Jeff?

278
00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:30.374
Hey.

279
00:28:33.477 --> 00:28:35.713
And once you come all this way,
for God knows...


280
00:28:35.746 --> 00:28:39.684
It's been ages since you've come
out here. Why? To piss me off?


281
00:28:39.717 --> 00:28:41.485
- No, listen...
- Yeah, to bring me down.


282
00:28:41.517 --> 00:28:44.622
- I came all the way to see you.
- Just like Dad's memorial.


283
00:28:44.654 --> 00:28:47.490
You hugged a teenage girl out of
nowhere. What'd you expect?


284
00:28:47.524 --> 00:28:49.994
I expect my brother
to give me a bit of support.


285
00:28:50.026 --> 00:28:52.095
- I do support you, Evan.
- Oh.


286
00:28:52.129 --> 00:28:53.731
Will you do me a favor?
Let's just...


287
00:28:53.764 --> 00:28:56.300
- I'll take you to the doctor.
- I don't...


288
00:28:56.333 --> 00:28:58.536
- I don't need that stuff anymore.
- I can take you there now.


289
00:28:58.568 --> 00:29:00.171
No, I don't
have time for that.


290
00:29:00.203 --> 00:29:02.405
- I got Katherine, we gonna work.
- Evan.


291
00:29:02.439 --> 00:29:04.408
I can't do this anymore.

292
00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:07.344
- What do you mean?
- I'm leaving, Evan.


293
00:29:08.746 --> 00:29:11.114
This time for good.

294
00:29:15.753 --> 00:29:17.722
- I'm gonna call that doctor.
- Oh.


295
00:29:17.755 --> 00:29:20.992
And he better tell me
that he's seen you recently.


296
00:29:21.025 --> 00:29:25.563
I'll go, I promise. I
-I will.

297
00:29:25.595 --> 00:29:27.198
Take care, okay?

298
00:29:28.297 --> 00:29:29.400
Yeah, yeah, sure.

299
00:29:30.633 --> 00:29:33.103
Hey, Jeff.

300
00:29:33.136 --> 00:29:35.705
Wanna say hello to Katherine?

301
00:29:35.738 --> 00:29:39.642
I'm tired, Evan. 
Get some help.

302
00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:19.049
Sorry I took so long.
Your uncle stopped by.


303
00:30:25.389 --> 00:30:28.125
Hey, I'm down here, hey.

304
00:30:28.158 --> 00:30:30.094
What are you doing? He's gone.

305
00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:36.333
Call him and tell him
to come back, please.


306
00:30:36.365 --> 00:30:38.835
- I wanna see my uncle.
- I know, honey.


307
00:30:38.869 --> 00:30:41.172
I told him you wanted to see him
but he had to go.


308
00:30:41.205 --> 00:30:43.307
Oh, look at you.
You're all sweaty.


309
00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:46.410
You were running for a long
time. I'm very proud of you.


310
00:30:46.442 --> 00:30:49.379
Here. Come upstairs.
We'll get you cleaned up.


311
00:31:08.731 --> 00:31:10.468
Here you go.
I've got your towel.


312
00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:12.335
What are you doing?
Get the fuck out!


313
00:31:12.369 --> 00:31:14.505
- All right, all right. Okay.
- Out!


314
00:31:14.537 --> 00:31:17.575
Keep your hair on.
Nothing I haven't seen before.


315
00:31:56.646 --> 00:31:58.181
In here, sweetie.

316
00:32:19.335 --> 00:32:20.671
Must feel good.

317
00:32:24.307 --> 00:32:25.308
To be home.

318
00:32:29.513 --> 00:32:31.315
Did you leave the water running?

319
00:32:31.347 --> 00:32:33.550
- Oh, I forgot.
- We can't waste water.


320
00:32:46.830 --> 00:32:51.235
You kind of left the room in
a bit of a mess. But you know,


321
00:32:52.803 --> 00:32:55.640
I think I managed to get
everything back in its place.


322
00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:59.477
Yeah. Thank you.

323
00:33:04.381 --> 00:33:06.217
Mr. Mo's been waiting for you.

324
00:33:08.619 --> 00:33:11.555
Oh, come on.
You remember Mr. Mo.


325
00:33:13.723 --> 00:33:15.658
I love you.

326
00:33:15.691 --> 00:33:17.260
Of course.

327
00:33:20.596 --> 00:33:24.867
Well, you take some time,
and I'll go make some food.


328
00:33:24.901 --> 00:33:26.504
Okay.

329
00:33:33.809 --> 00:33:34.877
Daddy.

330
00:34:52.723 --> 00:34:55.558
That's not gonna happen
this year.


331
00:34:55.591 --> 00:34:57.327
You're a champion.

332
00:34:57.361 --> 00:34:59.330
You're gonna get
that scholarship.


333
00:35:01.031 --> 00:35:03.500
I thought you might wanna
eat in the room.


334
00:35:06.469 --> 00:35:10.875
Hey. I'm sorry for acting
like such an idiot.


335
00:35:15.879 --> 00:35:17.982
I'm not proud of my behavior.
Just...


336
00:35:19.950 --> 00:35:23.687
I want things to go back to the
way that they were between us.


337
00:35:30.926 --> 00:35:32.430
I love you.

338
00:35:34.931 --> 00:35:36.934
I love you too, Daddy.

339
00:38:56.899 --> 00:38:57.867
Hey.

340
00:38:57.901 --> 00:38:58.902
Oh, hey.

341
00:38:58.935 --> 00:39:01.705
- Where were you going?
- Huh?


342
00:39:01.738 --> 00:39:04.575
I just wanted to see
if you needed help.


343
00:39:04.607 --> 00:39:05.975
You wanna help with cooking?

344
00:39:06.009 --> 00:39:07.077
Yeah.

345
00:39:08.712 --> 00:39:09.880
You hate cooking.

346
00:39:11.348 --> 00:39:14.116
I know, but I just figured
maybe you needed help.


347
00:39:14.149 --> 00:39:16.619
Say no more. Come with me.

348
00:39:28.698 --> 00:39:30.200
I got a job for you.

349
00:39:34.203 --> 00:39:37.873
Here. You cut the tomatoes.

350
00:39:40.109 --> 00:39:42.613
Making tea.
You want some?


351
00:39:42.645 --> 00:39:43.881
Sure.

352
00:39:48.817 --> 00:39:51.187
I thought I'd surprise you
and make your favorite.


353
00:39:51.221 --> 00:39:53.290
What do you think about that?

354
00:39:58.694 --> 00:40:00.096
Risotto. I love it.

355
00:40:01.330 --> 00:40:05.835
Risotto.
Since when do we have risotto?


356
00:40:05.868 --> 00:40:08.872
- Is that what you like now?
- No.


357
00:40:08.904 --> 00:40:12.375
Well, yeah.
But whatever you wanna make.


358
00:40:12.408 --> 00:40:16.046
I'm making spaghetti.

359
00:40:16.078 --> 00:40:18.649
Oh, I love spaghetti.
It's my favorite.


360
00:40:18.681 --> 00:40:20.017
Go ahead
and chop that tomato.


361
00:40:20.049 --> 00:40:21.618
- We're gonna need that.
- Okay.


362
00:40:25.254 --> 00:40:26.789
When did you learn
to do that?


363
00:40:26.823 --> 00:40:29.359
- My mom taught...
- Your mom?


364
00:40:29.392 --> 00:40:31.794
She was terrible
at chopping tomatoes.


365
00:40:31.828 --> 00:40:34.898
I didn't finish.
She taught me how not cut them.


366
00:40:34.931 --> 00:40:37.301
She was so bad at it.

367
00:40:41.071 --> 00:40:42.439
Oh, that.

368
00:40:42.471 --> 00:40:45.408
That's the Katherine
that I know and love.


369
00:40:45.442 --> 00:40:47.844
- I'm done with cooking now.
- Okay.


370
00:40:47.877 --> 00:40:49.145
You go off and have a rest.

371
00:40:49.178 --> 00:40:51.147
We're gonna have
to work out later.


372
00:40:59.089 --> 00:41:01.257
So where are you off to now?

373
00:41:01.290 --> 00:41:03.426
I was just gonna get
some fresh air.


374
00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:05.429
It's really hot in here.

375
00:41:05.462 --> 00:41:06.864
You forgot your tea.

376
00:41:08.964 --> 00:41:10.466
I changed my mind.

377
00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:12.236
You've changed a lot lately.

378
00:41:15.805 --> 00:41:17.339
You know...

379
00:41:17.372 --> 00:41:21.444
I think it may be best
for you to go to your room now.


380
00:42:05.221 --> 00:42:10.026
"Dear diary, my dad took away
my friend, Mr. Mo today.


381
00:42:10.058 --> 00:42:13.464
I miss him but dad says I need
to be a grown-up girl now."


382
00:42:21.337 --> 00:42:23.907
"All my family was here
for my birthday.


383
00:42:23.939 --> 00:42:27.209
After everyone left, my mom
started cleaning as usual.


384
00:42:27.243 --> 00:42:30.846
Dad and I played our game
in total darkness.


385
00:42:30.879 --> 00:42:32.815
He tried to chase me
around the house,


386
00:42:32.848 --> 00:42:34.383
but he caught me right away.

387
00:42:34.417 --> 00:42:37.254
He was mad at me for being
too slow and now I'm grounded."


388
00:42:38.922 --> 00:42:42.192
What was all that about?
You can do better than that.


389
00:42:42.225 --> 00:42:44.393
I mean, that was not fast.
If I can catch you,


390
00:42:44.426 --> 00:42:46.997
the guy in the back
can definitely catch you. Okay?


391
00:42:47.029 --> 00:42:50.100
I told you time and time again,
you got to stay focused.


392
00:42:50.132 --> 00:42:52.134
You can't get distracted.

393
00:42:52.167 --> 00:42:54.103
"We played hide and seek again.

394
00:42:54.136 --> 00:42:57.841
I love this game, but my
parents always fight afterwards.


395
00:42:57.873 --> 00:43:00.377
He's so bossy
and always makes me cry."


396
00:43:08.183 --> 00:43:11.921
I want all lights on
from now on.


397
00:43:11.955 --> 00:43:15.158
That's the second of my vases
you've broken in two months.


398
00:43:15.190 --> 00:43:16.526
Ivy, is just a vase.

399
00:43:16.558 --> 00:43:18.495
Don't you dare raise
your voice at me.


400
00:43:18.527 --> 00:43:19.962
Sorry.

401
00:43:19.995 --> 00:43:21.198
Here.

402
00:43:23.332 --> 00:43:25.868
- What you're doing is wrong.
- What is wrong?


403
00:43:29.038 --> 00:43:31.107
What's happened to you,
Evan?


404
00:43:31.140 --> 00:43:32.975
I don't know what to do anymore.

405
00:43:33.009 --> 00:43:35.579
I want our daughter to succeed.
Is that a crime?


406
00:43:35.611 --> 00:43:40.416
She's 12 years old. It's sick.
Let her enjoy her childhood.


407
00:43:40.450 --> 00:43:42.518
She's not just a child anymore.

408
00:43:42.551 --> 00:43:45.488
It is not normal at her age
to get that much exercise.


409
00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:48.257
- Don't you get it?
- We were just playing.


410
00:43:50.893 --> 00:43:52.495
It's good for her.
She loves it.


411
00:43:54.263 --> 00:43:56.332
Let her choose her own dreams.

412
00:43:56.366 --> 00:43:58.068
Not yours.

413
00:43:59.468 --> 00:44:02.404
You've become like your father.

414
00:44:02.437 --> 00:44:03.939
Oh, don't.

415
00:44:03.973 --> 00:44:05.475
It's the truth.

416
00:44:07.944 --> 00:44:09.846
She doesn't want this.

417
00:44:17.453 --> 00:44:21.024
Look,
am I really like my father?


418
00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:27.563
You can't just throw that
in my face and walk away.


419
00:44:27.596 --> 00:44:30.232
She's gonna thank me one day.
You're gonna see that.


420
00:44:30.265 --> 00:44:33.669
- She's gonna thank me.
- You need to stop this madness.


421
00:45:00.430 --> 00:45:01.565
"Sweet 16."

422
00:45:06.234 --> 00:45:08.037
- Dad?
- Uh-huh?


423
00:45:08.071 --> 00:45:10.973
- I'm gonna go out tonight.
- Mm? What's that?


424
00:45:11.006 --> 00:45:12.408
What? Oh, no you're not.

425
00:45:12.442 --> 00:45:14.444
It's your birthday.
It's time for family, hon.


426
00:45:14.477 --> 00:45:18.181
Yeah, but dad I-I'm 16,
I wanna go out.


427
00:45:18.214 --> 00:45:20.584
- Who with?
- Does it matter?


428
00:45:23.386 --> 00:45:26.256
- Um, with Jared.
- No.


429
00:45:26.288 --> 00:45:28.123
Dad, please don't do this.

430
00:45:28.156 --> 00:45:30.693
I promise I'll come home early
and spend time with you.


431
00:45:30.727 --> 00:45:32.696
You heard what I said,
don't make me say it again.


432
00:45:32.728 --> 00:45:35.064
- Daddy, I'm begging you.
- Look, your Uncle Jeff


433
00:45:35.098 --> 00:45:37.334
is gonna be here in two hours,
then have a lovely dinner


434
00:45:37.366 --> 00:45:39.468
your mother's worked
really hard to make.


435
00:45:39.502 --> 00:45:41.171
We're gonna play some games.

436
00:45:41.203 --> 00:45:43.539
Besides,
you've got to get to bed early.


437
00:45:43.573 --> 00:45:45.607
You got that five-mile run
in the morning.


438
00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:46.575
Mom!

439
00:45:59.455 --> 00:46:01.658
Hello? Hey, Jeff.

440
00:46:03.658 --> 00:46:07.029
Look, Jeff.
I'm gonna go, okay?


441
00:46:07.062 --> 00:46:09.966
It doesn't help
just having you nag me, okay?


442
00:46:11.667 --> 00:46:16.239
Yes, yes, anything
that makes you happy, okay?


443
00:46:16.272 --> 00:46:19.375
Yeah, okay.
Au revoir to you too.


444
00:46:20.743 --> 00:46:23.279
Katherine,
food's ready in 10 minutes.


445
00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:26.450
Okay, Daddy.

446
00:46:30.553 --> 00:46:32.589
"Today, I got my period again.

447
00:46:32.622 --> 00:46:35.158
Dad doesn't handle this well,

448
00:46:35.190 --> 00:46:37.227
every single time.

449
00:46:37.259 --> 00:46:39.261
He's so awkward
with the whole situation.


450
00:46:40.495 --> 00:46:42.464
Food's ready.

451
00:46:42.497 --> 00:46:44.200
Oh, no.

452
00:46:44.232 --> 00:46:47.136
Uncle Jeff's driving me bananas.

453
00:46:51.707 --> 00:46:54.810
Hello. Oh, hi there, Jeff.

454
00:46:54.843 --> 00:46:56.445
Nice to hear from you again.

455
00:46:56.478 --> 00:46:59.381
Look, look, Jeff, okay,
everything is fine over here.


456
00:46:59.415 --> 00:47:04.254
Could you just...
Would you please stop calling.


457
00:47:10.625 --> 00:47:12.261
I'm serving dinner.
Come on.


458
00:47:12.294 --> 00:47:15.498
Daddy,
I just started my period.


459
00:47:18.234 --> 00:47:23.773
Ah... Oh, uh,
but your dinner's ready.


460
00:47:23.806 --> 00:47:26.342
- I need some pads.
- Oh, okay.


461
00:47:26.375 --> 00:47:28.178
Can you just
use something else?


462
00:47:28.210 --> 00:47:30.279
I don't wanna drive
to town again...


463
00:47:30.312 --> 00:47:31.747
I need some pads right now.

464
00:47:31.781 --> 00:47:33.516
But I don't want to drive,
though.


465
00:47:33.549 --> 00:47:35.118
- Daddy!
- Okay, look.


466
00:47:35.151 --> 00:47:37.187
I'm sorry, look,
I'm sorry, please.


467
00:47:37.219 --> 00:47:39.089
Okay, please, don't cry,
don't cry.


468
00:47:39.122 --> 00:47:40.156
I'll go.

469
00:47:41.256 --> 00:47:43.092
I'll be like an hour.

470
00:47:53.736 --> 00:47:57.306
Hey, hon, I think
it would be a really good idea


471
00:47:57.339 --> 00:47:59.441
if you went to the basement
and trained while I was gone.


472
00:47:59.475 --> 00:48:02.511
- No, please, can I stay here?
- No, Katherine.


473
00:48:02.544 --> 00:48:04.880
I really want you to go
to the basement and train.


474
00:48:04.913 --> 00:48:08.584
You can either go nicely
or I can take you down there.


475
00:48:08.618 --> 00:48:09.686
Fine.

476
00:48:11.187 --> 00:48:13.656
Just let me
grab something first.


477
00:48:13.689 --> 00:48:15.457
What do you got there?

478
00:48:15.491 --> 00:48:17.661
It's just my diary. Jeez.

479
00:48:38.281 --> 00:48:40.283
- <i>Hey mom.</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>


480
00:48:40.315 --> 00:48:41.817
<i>How did you meet Dad?</i>

481
00:48:45.288 --> 00:48:47.390
Oh, you're taking me
way back now.


482
00:48:47.422 --> 00:48:49.392
I thought your dad
already told you.


483
00:48:49.424 --> 00:48:52.129
Yeah, but I want to hear
your version.


484
00:48:53.629 --> 00:48:57.901
Well, we were working
at the same school together,


485
00:48:57.933 --> 00:49:01.270
and we kind of liked each other.

486
00:49:01.303 --> 00:49:05.174
It took your dad
two semesters to ask me out.


487
00:49:06.942 --> 00:49:11.580
You can't tell by looking at
him now, but he used to be shy.


488
00:49:11.614 --> 00:49:14.417
- No way.
- Yeah.


489
00:49:14.450 --> 00:49:17.187
I still remember
when he asked me out.


490
00:49:17.219 --> 00:49:21.290
His hand were shaking,
his face was all red,


491
00:49:21.323 --> 00:49:25.661
sweating all over
this horrible brown shirt.


492
00:49:30.498 --> 00:49:31.567
You're set, honey.

493
00:49:32.868 --> 00:49:34.371
You're gorgeous.

494
00:49:35.504 --> 00:49:37.640
Jared's gonna lose it tonight.

495
00:49:41.343 --> 00:49:44.313
- He's home early.
- It's okay.


496
00:49:44.346 --> 00:49:45.714
Just let me do the talking.

497
00:49:45.747 --> 00:49:48.550
<i>He must been speeding, again.</i>

498
00:49:50.620 --> 00:49:51.755
Shit.

499
00:50:25.721 --> 00:50:28.725
Hello, good sir.
The name is Neil.


500
00:50:28.757 --> 00:50:31.560
Sorry to bother you,
but do you have a minute?


501
00:50:32.962 --> 00:50:34.897
What do you need?

502
00:50:34.930 --> 00:50:37.000
Have you seen my girlfriend?

503
00:50:43.973 --> 00:50:45.308
Have you seen her?

504
00:50:45.341 --> 00:50:46.875
She's lost.

505
00:50:50.779 --> 00:50:52.448
- Is this a joke?
- Excuse me?


506
00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:53.783
Do you think this is funny?

507
00:50:53.815 --> 00:50:55.718
- I don't understand.
- What was your name?


508
00:50:55.750 --> 00:50:57.620
- Neil.
- Neil.


509
00:50:57.652 --> 00:51:00.390
Let me get this straight, Neil.
You're coming on my property,


510
00:51:00.422 --> 00:51:01.857
you tell me the girl
in this picture


511
00:51:01.890 --> 00:51:03.425
she's your girlfriend
and she's missing.


512
00:51:03.459 --> 00:51:05.395
That's right, sir.

513
00:51:05.428 --> 00:51:06.562
Who put you up to this?

514
00:51:06.594 --> 00:51:07.863
I'm just here to...

515
00:51:07.897 --> 00:51:10.000
It's Jeff!
Jeff put you up to this.


516
00:51:11.533 --> 00:51:12.901
Excuse me?

517
00:51:12.935 --> 00:51:14.871
I want you to get off
of my property


518
00:51:14.904 --> 00:51:16.806
and not come back.

519
00:51:16.839 --> 00:51:19.308
- Can I...
- Am I making myself clear?


520
00:51:19.341 --> 00:51:21.977
- Can I get my picture back...
- You're on a private property.


521
00:51:22.011 --> 00:51:23.446
Want me
to call the cops?


522
00:51:23.478 --> 00:51:24.846
Sir, I just want
the picture back...


523
00:51:24.879 --> 00:51:27.082
No, I want you out of here.

524
00:51:27.116 --> 00:51:28.652
It's your final warning.

525
00:51:30.486 --> 00:51:33.022
Okay, jeez, psycho.

526
00:51:34.089 --> 00:51:35.825
I'm not gonna say it again.

527
00:51:40.029 --> 00:51:41.631
Drive safe.

528
00:52:08.424 --> 00:52:11.828
<i>"Dad got mad at me
again for no apparent reason.</i>


529
00:52:11.861 --> 00:52:13.895
It always happens randomly.

530
00:52:13.928 --> 00:52:15.497
One second he's calm,

531
00:52:15.531 --> 00:52:17.967
and the next,
he becomes a different person.


532
00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:19.502
A beast.

533
00:52:19.535 --> 00:52:21.571
You can't escape from a beast.

534
00:52:21.603 --> 00:52:24.107
He needs help. I need help.

535
00:52:24.140 --> 00:52:25.641
I miss mom."

536
00:52:39.053 --> 00:52:40.822
Sorry, I'm late back.

537
00:52:40.855 --> 00:52:44.960
I, uh... I got your... You know.

538
00:52:44.993 --> 00:52:48.364
Uncle Jeff wouldn't stop nagging
me about going to the doctor.


539
00:52:50.799 --> 00:52:53.402
So I...

540
00:52:53.435 --> 00:52:57.873
I called in while I was out,
uh, picked up some meds.


541
00:53:04.446 --> 00:53:07.783
Oh, look, it's nothing,
it's just, uh...


542
00:53:07.817 --> 00:53:10.420
When you left I was, uh,

543
00:53:10.453 --> 00:53:12.422
seeing him for a bit just,
you know,


544
00:53:12.455 --> 00:53:15.056
to help with my anger
and my anxiety and stuff.


545
00:53:15.089 --> 00:53:17.760
Hey, don't worry,
I'm working on my nerves.


546
00:53:20.529 --> 00:53:22.165
You want me to stay here?

547
00:53:22.198 --> 00:53:23.799
I was gonna fix dinner.

548
00:53:23.832 --> 00:53:26.067
I'm gonna go to my room.

549
00:53:28.904 --> 00:53:32.608
I promised myself
I wasn't gonna ask say this.


550
00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:35.644
During this little break
you had,


551
00:53:35.678 --> 00:53:36.913
where were you?

552
00:53:39.647 --> 00:53:42.084
- Who were you with?
- What do you mean?


553
00:53:42.116 --> 00:53:43.685
You know exactly what I mean.

554
00:53:43.718 --> 00:53:46.488
I was with my boyfriend.
Jared.


555
00:53:50.024 --> 00:53:52.694
You were with Jared.

556
00:53:52.727 --> 00:53:54.663
Yeah, why?

557
00:53:55.897 --> 00:53:57.466
No reason.

558
00:53:57.500 --> 00:53:58.635
Wait.

559
00:54:00.002 --> 00:54:02.038
Since we're here,
let's check your height.


560
00:54:02.071 --> 00:54:03.806
See if you've grown any taller.

561
00:54:03.839 --> 00:54:05.241
- I'm not feeling well.
- Come on.


562
00:54:05.274 --> 00:54:06.509
We're gonna get
your measurements.


563
00:54:06.542 --> 00:54:07.643
Up against the wall.

564
00:54:07.676 --> 00:54:09.712
Come on.

565
00:54:09.745 --> 00:54:12.147
Up straight, up straight.

566
00:54:12.181 --> 00:54:15.818
Keep your head up.
I don't wanna make a mistake.


567
00:54:15.850 --> 00:54:17.886
All right. Step aside.

568
00:54:19.154 --> 00:54:20.590
No, that can't be right.

569
00:54:20.622 --> 00:54:21.890
What are you? Hunchbacked?

570
00:54:21.924 --> 00:54:23.159
Come on, try again.

571
00:54:23.192 --> 00:54:24.794
Put your back against the wall.

572
00:54:28.263 --> 00:54:29.231
Here.

573
00:54:32.634 --> 00:54:34.002
That's better.

574
00:54:34.035 --> 00:54:36.238
Looks like we've got
to strengthen your back.


575
00:54:36.272 --> 00:54:37.873
Come on. We'll get your weight.

576
00:54:40.209 --> 00:54:41.243
Hop up.

577
00:54:43.678 --> 00:54:45.147
A hundred pounds?

578
00:54:48.616 --> 00:54:53.288
You've lost 20 pounds. Oh.
Oh, cool, no don't worry.


579
00:54:53.321 --> 00:54:56.191
God. It's not a problem, you
know, nothing to worry about.


580
00:54:56.225 --> 00:54:57.259
Keep your cool.

581
00:55:01.297 --> 00:55:02.632
Here.

582
00:55:02.665 --> 00:55:05.735
- How many?
- I don't know how many.


583
00:55:05.768 --> 00:55:09.872
Years of preparation
just went to hell. Jesus.


584
00:55:09.904 --> 00:55:12.207
- You don't have any respect.
- Sorry.


585
00:55:12.241 --> 00:55:14.643
Just do it till I say stop,
come on.


586
00:55:17.580 --> 00:55:18.848
Did I say stop?

587
00:55:18.881 --> 00:55:20.982
I don't even know why I bother.

588
00:55:21.015 --> 00:55:23.184
It's just
a complete waste of time...


589
00:55:23.218 --> 00:55:24.553
Ow!

590
00:55:29.257 --> 00:55:30.192
Psycho.

591
00:55:47.241 --> 00:55:48.644
Katherine!

592
00:55:54.216 --> 00:55:55.852
Give me the keys.

593
00:55:58.252 --> 00:56:00.789
I said give me the fucking keys.

594
00:56:07.997 --> 00:56:10.165
How could you do that?

595
00:56:11.966 --> 00:56:14.669
How could you do that
to your own father?


596
00:56:14.703 --> 00:56:18.708
How could you do that?
Your own father.


597
00:56:20.908 --> 00:56:24.046
How could you do that
to someone who loves you?


598
00:56:46.435 --> 00:56:49.005
"First day at the hospital."

599
00:56:49.038 --> 00:56:50.973
Oh, no.

600
00:56:55.009 --> 00:56:56.845
Your dinner is on the table.

601
00:58:27.002 --> 00:58:27.937
I'm sorry.

602
00:58:36.844 --> 00:58:37.779
Daddy.

603
00:58:40.515 --> 00:58:42.918
Can you say the prayer tonight?

604
00:58:46.187 --> 00:58:47.390
Sure.

605
00:58:50.359 --> 00:58:52.294
Bless us, oh lord,
for these, thy gifts,


606
00:58:52.326 --> 00:58:56.297
which we are about to receive
from thy bounty, though Christ.


607
00:58:56.330 --> 00:58:58.299
Bless us, oh lord,
for these, thy gifts,


608
00:58:58.332 --> 00:59:00.135
which we are about to receive
from the bounty,


609
00:59:00.169 --> 00:59:01.471
through Christ, our lord.

610
00:59:06.542 --> 00:59:09.245
Thank you for bringing
my daughter back to me.


611
00:59:12.580 --> 00:59:14.517
I promise to love her
with all my heart,


612
00:59:14.549 --> 00:59:17.185
no matter what she does.

613
00:59:17.218 --> 00:59:20.088
Everything I have is hers.

614
00:59:20.122 --> 00:59:24.225
Please, just give me
the patience,


615
00:59:24.259 --> 00:59:26.061
to help her achieve her dreams,

616
00:59:26.093 --> 00:59:30.165
without losing my cool
like a complete freakin' idiot.


617
00:59:30.198 --> 00:59:31.366
Amen.

618
00:59:37.872 --> 00:59:39.307
Well, go ahead. Just...

619
00:59:39.341 --> 00:59:41.210
Eat your dinner.

620
00:59:55.122 --> 00:59:56.224
Dad?

621
00:59:57.259 --> 00:59:58.561
Yes, sweetie.

622
00:59:58.593 --> 01:00:01.162
The schools are gonna open
again soon.


623
01:00:01.196 --> 01:00:02.464
When do you have to go back?

624
01:00:04.565 --> 01:00:05.935
I've retired, hon.

625
01:00:08.303 --> 01:00:11.808
I retired after you left.
I just... I...


626
01:00:15.576 --> 01:00:17.580
So, what about me?

627
01:00:17.613 --> 01:00:21.951
Well, your Uncle Jeff.
He said it was better


628
01:00:21.984 --> 01:00:25.054
that I stay out here,
so I'm gonna be teaching you.


629
01:00:26.654 --> 01:00:29.490
You're gonna be doing
some homeschooling.


630
01:00:44.272 --> 01:00:48.042
You know, they-they named
the library after your mother.


631
01:00:48.076 --> 01:00:51.147
- Oh, I didn't know that.
- You should have been there.


632
01:00:53.614 --> 01:00:55.651
If you haven't blamed me
and just run off.


633
01:00:55.683 --> 01:00:59.120
- I don't blame you. That's not...
- You know, don't. Don't.


634
01:00:59.154 --> 01:01:00.356
- I'm not.
- Just...


635
01:01:02.390 --> 01:01:05.627
Finish your dinner
then wash the dishes.


636
01:01:25.413 --> 01:01:26.915
Dad?

637
01:01:28.183 --> 01:01:29.485
Yeah?

638
01:01:29.518 --> 01:01:31.320
Could we have some music?

639
01:01:31.352 --> 01:01:33.588
It's really quiet in here.

640
01:01:33.622 --> 01:01:36.091
You wanna hear your lullaby?

641
01:01:36.123 --> 01:01:37.292
Sure.

642
01:01:52.341 --> 01:01:53.476
What the hell?

643
01:02:02.350 --> 01:02:04.053
Hey, you know
what I was thinking?


644
01:02:04.085 --> 01:02:05.520
What?

645
01:02:05.553 --> 01:02:09.023
We haven't play our little game
for a long time.


646
01:02:09.056 --> 01:02:11.225
How about we have
a bit of fun?


647
01:02:11.259 --> 01:02:12.328
Yeah.

648
01:02:17.565 --> 01:02:18.533
Ready?

649
01:02:42.390 --> 01:02:43.658
Here comes Daddy.

650
01:02:45.060 --> 01:02:47.328
- Ow!
- What? What?


651
01:02:47.361 --> 01:02:50.064
- Are you okay? Are you okay?
- It's my ankle.


652
01:02:50.098 --> 01:02:52.401
Come on. Up. Up. Oh, I got you.

653
01:02:52.433 --> 01:02:56.205
I got you. Keep it still.
Here we go. Here we go.


654
01:04:00.435 --> 01:04:02.538
Come on.
We're getting out of here.


655
01:04:02.571 --> 01:04:04.206
Watch your ankle.

656
01:04:17.118 --> 01:04:20.321
- Is it over?
- Yeah, I think so.


657
01:04:20.355 --> 01:04:22.257
Okay, come on, let's go in.

658
01:04:22.290 --> 01:04:24.259
- I can walk.
- Okay.


659
01:04:33.134 --> 01:04:34.402
Katherine?

660
01:04:35.770 --> 01:04:38.174
I wanna stay out here
a little longer.


661
01:04:40.542 --> 01:04:43.245
It will be a mess inside.

662
01:04:43.277 --> 01:04:45.513
I need you to help me
clean it up.


663
01:04:47.716 --> 01:04:49.218
Okay.

664
01:05:09.770 --> 01:05:12.707
Oh, no. Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I'll take that.


665
01:05:14.743 --> 01:05:16.478
Your mom made that.

666
01:05:16.511 --> 01:05:19.815
- Oh, I-I forgot.
- Yeah. Better get it fixed up.


667
01:05:25.386 --> 01:05:26.654
It's the photo damaged?

668
01:05:26.687 --> 01:05:28.756
No. The glass is broken, though.

669
01:05:30.825 --> 01:05:32.361
That was my last race.

670
01:05:33.661 --> 01:05:36.297
Now, that is not
gonna happen to you.


671
01:05:37.464 --> 01:05:39.401
Your father cares.

672
01:05:39.433 --> 01:05:41.469
You are gonna win.

673
01:05:50.477 --> 01:05:52.914
Well, about time.
How you feeling?


674
01:05:52.948 --> 01:05:54.516
- Good. Yeah.
- Yeah? Feeling good?


675
01:05:54.549 --> 01:05:56.185
- Feeling strong?
- Yeah, I'm ready.


676
01:05:56.218 --> 01:05:57.853
Let's go, girl. Go.

677
01:06:03.357 --> 01:06:05.493
Three laps around the lines. Go!

678
01:06:09.997 --> 01:06:13.268
See if you can beat my record
any time soon, hon.


679
01:06:15.703 --> 01:06:17.439
No, Katherine.
Eyes straight ahead.


680
01:06:17.471 --> 01:06:19.307
Don't get distracted.

681
01:06:19.341 --> 01:06:20.808
That's it girl. That's it!

682
01:06:24.245 --> 01:06:27.548
Come on. Put the pace on.
Keep the pace up.


683
01:06:27.582 --> 01:06:30.752
Keep the pace up.
One more lap. Come on.


684
01:06:33.555 --> 01:06:34.890
No, wait, wait, Katherine.

685
01:06:34.922 --> 01:06:37.625
No, Katherine.

686
01:06:41.495 --> 01:06:44.566
Katherine. Katherine.

687
01:06:46.734 --> 01:06:48.370
Please, no, don't leave.

688
01:06:48.402 --> 01:06:49.571
Don't leave.

689
01:06:50.772 --> 01:06:53.642
My ankle. My ankle.

690
01:06:53.674 --> 01:06:58.214
What? What? Oh, no.
Oh, no. Oh, no.


691
01:07:11.459 --> 01:07:14.796
Careful. Okay.

692
01:07:14.828 --> 01:07:16.631
Can we eat it?

693
01:07:16.665 --> 01:07:17.833
- Yep.
- Great.


694
01:07:37.785 --> 01:07:38.820
Okay.

695
01:07:42.390 --> 01:07:46.395
Seventy-one, 72, 73...

696
01:08:20.761 --> 01:08:24.065
Whoa, whoa, no, whoa, whoa. Oh.

697
01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:27.736
You're not ready.

698
01:08:27.769 --> 01:08:29.805
Am I not ready or is it you?

699
01:08:29.837 --> 01:08:32.474
Switch around. Come on.

700
01:09:01.803 --> 01:09:04.372
Come on, you must've
finished your homework by now.


701
01:09:04.406 --> 01:09:06.140
- Your dinner's getting cold.
- I did. Okay.


702
01:09:06.174 --> 01:09:07.910
Come on, grab the plates.

703
01:09:14.681 --> 01:09:17.519
I know somebody who's gonna have
a birthday soon.


704
01:09:19.487 --> 01:09:21.823
- Oh, right.
- What?


705
01:09:21.855 --> 01:09:24.693
Oh, you did not forget
your birthday, did you?


706
01:09:24.725 --> 01:09:26.827
Just for a second,
I remember now.


707
01:09:28.595 --> 01:09:30.732
Better start thinking
about what you want.


708
01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:34.402
Anything you like. Name it.

709
01:09:34.435 --> 01:09:36.438
You know exactly what I want,
Dad.


710
01:09:36.470 --> 01:09:41.108
I just wanted to say how very,
very proud I am of you.


711
01:09:41.142 --> 01:09:43.812
It's true. I, uh...

712
01:09:43.845 --> 01:09:47.082
you worked towards your goals
with determination, commitment,


713
01:09:47.114 --> 01:09:49.984
and you've got out of your
comfort zone every single day...


714
01:09:50.018 --> 01:09:51.720
- Would you stop it already?
- Why?


715
01:09:51.752 --> 01:09:53.621
I just want to say
what I really feel.


716
01:09:53.654 --> 01:09:55.122
We did it together, Dad.

717
01:09:55.156 --> 01:09:57.792
If it weren't for you,
I wouldn't come this far.


718
01:09:57.826 --> 01:09:59.461
- So you're feeling ready?
- Yeah.


719
01:09:59.493 --> 01:10:02.797
Hey, that's good, 'cause
I've entered you in a race.


720
01:10:02.831 --> 01:10:06.701
- What?
- Oh, yeah.


721
01:10:06.733 --> 01:10:10.738
You're gonna be running
in seven weeks.


722
01:10:10.772 --> 01:10:13.841
- I'm running in seven weeks?
- You sure are.


723
01:10:19.647 --> 01:10:21.049
Thanks, Dad.

724
01:10:21.081 --> 01:10:23.517
I waited for such a long time.
That's it!


725
01:10:23.550 --> 01:10:25.219
- What's it?
- The best present.


726
01:10:25.252 --> 01:10:28.189
- Oh.
- You forgot the tomatoes.


727
01:10:51.578 --> 01:10:54.715
That, uh, bird
was driving me nuts.


728
01:10:56.917 --> 01:10:58.053
- Here, get in.
- What?


729
01:10:58.086 --> 01:10:59.921
Oh, no. Don't.
You don't want that.


730
01:10:59.953 --> 01:11:03.157
- I wanna remember the moment.
- I'm terrible at selfies.


731
01:11:18.639 --> 01:11:19.974
I love you, Dad.

732
01:11:21.209 --> 01:11:23.044
I love you more.

733
01:11:23.077 --> 01:11:24.813
Hey, come on. Let's eat.

734
01:11:27.549 --> 01:11:28.984
We have to pray first.

735
01:11:30.852 --> 01:11:32.787
Bless us, oh lord,
for these, thy gifts,


736
01:11:32.819 --> 01:11:34.922
which we're about to receive
from thy bounty


737
01:11:34.956 --> 01:11:37.692
through Christ,
our Lord. Amen.


738
01:11:37.724 --> 01:11:40.227
And 98, come on.

739
01:11:40.260 --> 01:11:42.830
Here she comes, 99.

740
01:11:42.863 --> 01:11:46.734
Here we go, ladies and gentlemen
and it's a hundred.


741
01:11:46.768 --> 01:11:48.837
Ladies and gentlemen,
she did a hundred.


742
01:11:48.870 --> 01:11:50.037
- Whoo-hoo!
- Yeah!


743
01:11:50.071 --> 01:11:52.306
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

744
01:11:52.340 --> 01:11:55.710
You. I am so proud of you,
you're amazing.


745
01:11:55.742 --> 01:11:57.545
Come on. Up here. Let's go.

746
01:11:57.578 --> 01:12:01.549
Stand up straight,
stand up straight. Here we go.


747
01:12:01.582 --> 01:12:02.817
And...

748
01:12:04.352 --> 01:12:07.988
She's getting bigger.
Come on, moment of truth.


749
01:12:08.022 --> 01:12:10.992
Here we go. Up you get. Come on.

750
01:12:11.024 --> 01:12:12.727
You get.

751
01:12:12.760 --> 01:12:13.962
Don't look. Don't look!

752
01:12:15.697 --> 01:12:17.065
- Oh, no.
- What?


753
01:12:17.098 --> 01:12:18.567
It's freaking perfect.

754
01:12:18.599 --> 01:12:20.669
- It is freaking perfect!
- Whoo!


755
01:13:17.190 --> 01:13:21.261
♪ Sleep now, Katherine
My love ♪


756

759
01:13:40.747 --> 01:13:42.384
I didn't mean to kill your mom.

760
01:13:43.350 --> 01:13:44.920
I know.

761
01:13:49.256 --> 01:13:51.158
You look just like her.

762
01:14:57.992 --> 01:15:00.261
Hey, honeybun.
Didn't know you were up.


763
01:15:00.294 --> 01:15:02.363
- I'm gonna go for a run.
- Oh, no, you're not.


764
01:15:02.395 --> 01:15:03.764
This is your special day.

765
01:15:03.797 --> 01:15:05.366
But the race
is in a couple of days.


766
01:15:05.398 --> 01:15:08.836
Oh, yes. And today is Sunday
and Sunday is...


767
01:15:08.870 --> 01:15:10.738
- A day of rest.
- That's right.


768
01:15:12.072 --> 01:15:13.340
Close your eyes.

769
01:15:23.317 --> 01:15:24.986
Open.

770
01:15:25.019 --> 01:15:26.321
Happy birthday.

771
01:15:26.354 --> 01:15:28.490
- Is this...?
- It is.


772
01:15:28.523 --> 01:15:31.292
- Thanks, Dad.
- Ah! Forgetting something?


773
01:15:31.325 --> 01:15:32.861
Hm-mm.

774
01:15:34.929 --> 01:15:37.399
Gotcha. Off you go.

775
01:15:41.402 --> 01:15:43.304
I'm gonna be heading out
for a while.


776
01:15:43.336 --> 01:15:45.239
No birthday without cake.

777
01:17:37.318 --> 01:17:38.587
What are you doing out here?

778
01:17:39.987 --> 01:17:41.223
Hi, dad.

779
01:17:43.456 --> 01:17:45.425
Well, don't just stand there.

780
01:17:45.459 --> 01:17:49.430
Get over here. Give your old
man a hand, huh? Come on.


781
01:17:55.036 --> 01:17:59.306
Here. You take that one.
And you take that one.


782
01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:02.077
I'll take this one.

783
01:18:04.612 --> 01:18:06.114
Oh!

784
01:18:07.547 --> 01:18:09.483
Come on. Come inside.

785
01:18:12.019 --> 01:18:13.288
Come on.

786
01:18:29.737 --> 01:18:31.640
Dad? Are you okay?

787
01:18:34.241 --> 01:18:37.612
Better get that ice cream
in the freezer before it melts.


788
01:18:37.644 --> 01:18:40.547
I got your favorite.
Chocolate fudge sundae.


789
01:18:40.581 --> 01:18:42.483
Oh, yeah, I know.
There goes the diet.


790
01:18:42.515 --> 01:18:44.352
But hey, it's only once a year.

791
01:18:53.394 --> 01:18:55.063
What are you doing?

792
01:18:55.095 --> 01:18:57.732
No, I don't want you in here
while I'm setting up.


793
01:18:57.764 --> 01:19:01.001
You go to your room.
This could take a while.


794
01:19:01.035 --> 01:19:02.703
How'd you know I'd be here?

795
01:19:02.737 --> 01:19:05.139
You are going to spoil
the surprise.


796
01:19:05.171 --> 01:19:07.375
Go to your room. Go on,
quick, quick, go, go!


797
01:19:07.407 --> 01:19:09.376
That's it?
Go to your room?


798
01:19:09.410 --> 01:19:11.546
How about I miss you,
I love you, I hate you,


799
01:19:11.578 --> 01:19:13.281
where the hell have you been?

800
01:19:13.313 --> 01:19:16.718
Of course I love you. What the
hell kind of question is that?


801
01:19:20.321 --> 01:19:22.556
Are you on your period?

802
01:19:22.590 --> 01:19:24.192
I don't understand.

803
01:19:24.224 --> 01:19:27.227
Just go to your room, please?
Go on. Do some homework.


804
01:19:27.260 --> 01:19:29.229
- Homework? I don't have homework.
- Just go.


805
01:19:29.263 --> 01:19:30.497
Okay, I'm going.

806
01:19:56.157 --> 01:19:57.592
Hey. Heh-heh.

807
01:20:53.581 --> 01:20:55.616
I love your handwriting.

808
01:20:55.648 --> 01:20:57.051
Who are you?

809
01:21:04.892 --> 01:21:06.861
Did you read my diary?

810
01:21:06.894 --> 01:21:09.163
Yes. To study you.

811
01:21:09.196 --> 01:21:10.832
I've admired you
for a long time.


812
01:21:10.864 --> 01:21:12.567
What?

813
01:21:12.599 --> 01:21:14.669
I never thought
I'd meet you in person.


814
01:21:14.702 --> 01:21:17.238
All right, enough.

815
01:21:17.270 --> 01:21:21.608
It's funny. Your voice
is just like I imagined it.


816
01:21:22.876 --> 01:21:25.779
- Happy birthday, by the way.
- Thanks.


817
01:21:25.813 --> 01:21:27.849
How does it feel
to finally be an adult?


818
01:21:29.315 --> 01:21:31.752
Free? Independent?

819
01:21:33.487 --> 01:21:36.157
Must not have liked it much,
or you wouldn't be back.


820
01:21:36.189 --> 01:21:39.393
Enough about me.
I want to know who you are.


821
01:21:42.630 --> 01:21:45.366
I'm you, a year younger.

822
01:21:46.500 --> 01:21:48.402
Excuse me?

823
01:21:48.434 --> 01:21:50.504
I live here now.

824
01:21:50.537 --> 01:21:54.776
I sleep in your bed, eat
your food, wear your clothes.


825
01:21:57.478 --> 01:21:59.747
I chose this dress for tonight.

826
01:22:01.348 --> 01:22:02.283
What do you think?

827
01:22:06.386 --> 01:22:08.122
Dad likes it on me.

828
01:22:09.822 --> 01:22:12.160
He says green is my color.

829
01:22:22.336 --> 01:22:25.506
I broke your record
for the mile, by the way.


830
01:22:25.538 --> 01:22:27.308
I finally made Dad proud.

831
01:22:27.340 --> 01:22:31.178
Dad? Why do you keep calling
my dad that? What's going on?


832
01:22:31.211 --> 01:22:33.915
You see, I'm not afraid
of anything anymore.


833
01:22:35.549 --> 01:22:37.350
It's because
I'm finally happy now.


834
01:22:37.384 --> 01:22:40.921
- You're starting to freak me out.
- I know. You're scared.


835
01:22:43.690 --> 01:22:45.760
- I was scared too.
- Please stay there.


836
01:22:46.794 --> 01:22:48.528
You don't get it, do you?

837
01:22:51.331 --> 01:22:54.234
I don't know what you want.
I just came here to see my dad.


838
01:22:54.268 --> 01:22:55.970
I'm not looking
for any trouble.


839
01:22:56.002 --> 01:22:58.738
He needed help
after the accident.


840
01:22:58.772 --> 01:23:00.507
Even if he was
speeding that night,


841
01:23:00.541 --> 01:23:02.410
you could have supported him.

842
01:23:02.443 --> 01:23:04.212
He didn't do it on purpose.

843
01:23:04.245 --> 01:23:08.916
Oh, look at her.

844
01:23:08.948 --> 01:23:11.518
She's crying.

845
01:23:11.551 --> 01:23:14.889
What a poor little bitch!

846
01:23:16.357 --> 01:23:18.459
He loves you.

847
01:23:20.560 --> 01:23:22.362
You have no idea
how it really feels


848
01:23:22.395 --> 01:23:24.398
to have a monster
type of a father.


849
01:23:24.430 --> 01:23:25.399
A beast!

850
01:23:29.769 --> 01:23:31.471
I can't go back.

851
01:23:36.309 --> 01:23:37.245
I'm sorry.

852
01:23:51.925 --> 01:23:53.961
Everything okay in
there, sweetheart?


853
01:23:53.993 --> 01:23:56.529
Everything's fine, Daddy.

854
01:23:56.563 --> 01:23:59.467
Don't keep me waiting.

855
01:23:59.500 --> 01:24:00.667
Okay.

856
01:24:22.456 --> 01:24:26.727
♪ Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you ♪


857
01:24:26.760 --> 01:24:29.030

860
01:24:38.639 --> 01:24:42.277
Oh, my God, you...
You're so beautiful.


861
01:24:44.077 --> 01:24:46.546
Thanks, Dad.
Can we go for a drive?


862
01:24:48.047 --> 01:24:50.385
Yeah, sure. Of course we can.

863
01:24:52.920 --> 01:24:53.921
I'm driving.

864
01:24:55.723 --> 01:25:00.862
Sure and I'll just get my wallet
and I'll see you in the car.


865
01:25:59.153 --> 01:26:02.390
- Be careful.
- Always.
