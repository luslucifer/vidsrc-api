[Watson] Who are you?

4
00:00:39.222 --> 00:00:42.916
I'm your worst nightmare
that's who I am.

00:00:43.051 --> 00:00:45.254
[shouting] I'm talkin' to you!
That's who!

What? I don't give a damn!

You're violatin' the most basic

who doesn't have means
to fight you.


11
00:00:55.437 --> 00:00:58.134
I'm gonna bury you,
you motherfucker.

You threatenin' me?

Hey, do it to my face.

Good talkin' to you, too,

I'm Richard.

22
00:01:20.788 --> 00:01:22.297
I'm sorry I was listening.

23
00:01:22.432 --> 00:01:24.472
I didn't mean to be rude.
I wasn't raised like that.


24
00:01:25.598 --> 00:01:27.767
You always start
every sentence with "I"?

I'm [sighs]

I'm sorry, sir. I'm the new

- [exhales]
- Eavesdropping on me?


29
00:01:38.076 --> 00:01:40.282
No, sir.

30
00:01:40.417 --> 00:01:42.289
Well, good. I need some
more tape, so get on that.


31
00:01:42.313 --> 00:01:44.143
Yeah, about that.

32
00:01:44.278 --> 00:01:46.613
You're gonna wanna check
the second drawer down, sir.


33
00:01:46.748 --> 00:01:49.114
Tape and a new box of pens.

34
00:01:52.193 --> 00:01:53.822
I saw you were runnin' low.

35
00:01:54.555 --> 00:01:55.956
What's that?

36
00:01:56.092 --> 00:01:59.064
You might wanna check
the next drawer down.

Uh

41
00:02:13.173 --> 00:02:15.348
I knew you liked them
'cause I saw


42
00:02:15.484 --> 00:02:17.949
you had the wrappers
in your trash can.

Don't go in my trash.

45
00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:24.688
Nobody goes in my trash.
What's your name?

00:02:26.862 --> 00:02:27.955
Richard Jewell.

47
00:02:29.663 --> 00:02:31.200
From now on,
I'm gonna call you Radar.

Like from<i>M#A#S#H?</i>

Pretty tough crowd
you're runnin' with here.


56
00:03:15.168 --> 00:03:16.938
Got a little nervous comin' in.

57
00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.776
How you doin', sir?

58
00:03:21.242 --> 00:03:23.608
Don't worry, all right.
I come here often.

00:03:31.385 --> 00:03:33.724
Thank you. This is
actually kind of like, uh...


62
00:03:35.255 --> 00:03:36.655
Kind of like practice
for my future

APD, FBI, maybe Secret Service.

00:03:42.034 --> 00:03:44.273
[Watson] What the hell
would you wanna do that for?


66
00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.773
'Cause I believe
in protecting people, sir.


67
00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.416
I study the penal code
every night.


68
00:03:56.749 --> 00:03:58.914
Sounds like a humdinger
of a night.


69
00:04:00.484 --> 00:04:02.820
- Yes!
- Oh.


70
00:04:02.956 --> 00:04:06.291
Yeah, it's not bad.
You got some beginner's luck.


71
00:04:06.427 --> 00:04:08.089
Yeah, what's wrong with 9,700?

72
00:04:08.224 --> 00:04:10.827
Eh, nothing's wrong with it
for a first time.


73
00:04:10.962 --> 00:04:14.227
First time?
All right, come on, let's go.


74
00:04:14.363 --> 00:04:17.005
Oh. They only give me, like,

75
00:04:17.141 --> 00:04:18.463
I gotta head back in a minute.

76
00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:19.898
Shut up.

77
00:04:20.033 --> 00:04:21.376
You can say you're with me.

78
00:04:22.978 --> 00:04:24.412
Let's get it on.

Let's see what you got, hotshot.

00:04:31.814 --> 00:04:33.883
Yeah, I mean business, too.

83
00:04:34.018 --> 00:04:35.984
- [Watson] Yeah?
- You ever do it with one hand?


84

Mr. Bryant?

Oh, Jesus Christ.

86
00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:43.926
Sorry.

87
00:04:44.061 --> 00:04:46.330
I'm a little busy.
Not a good time, so...


88
00:04:46.466 --> 00:04:47.660
- Yeah...
- Talk later?


89
00:04:47.796 --> 00:04:49.028
I know you're busy.

90
00:04:49.164 --> 00:04:50.524
I just wanted to [clears throat]

[exhales]
come by to let you know,


92
00:04:52.003 --> 00:04:53.479
I'm not gonna be
workin' here anymore.


93
00:04:53.503 --> 00:04:55.472
Came to say bye.

94
00:04:55.608 --> 00:04:58.642
Got a new job doin' security.

95
00:04:58.778 --> 00:05:00.875
- Okay.
- So, that starts tomorrow.


96
00:05:01.011 --> 00:05:03.011
All right. Hey, good to see you.

97
00:05:05.984 --> 00:05:08.819
I wanted to give you something
before I leave.


98
00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:12.321
Just to say thank you.

99
00:05:12.456 --> 00:05:13.995
Hey, okay. Uh...

100
00:05:14.131 --> 00:05:15.661
[clears throat] Thank you.

101
00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:21.964
I noticed you were runnin' low.

102
00:05:24.171 --> 00:05:25.539
All right.

103
00:05:26.635 --> 00:05:27.904
Hey, come here.

104
00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:32.041
- What?
- You got enough money?


105
00:05:32.176 --> 00:05:35.250
Yeah, I guess so.
Why do you... Why do you ask?


106
00:05:35.385 --> 00:05:37.051
This comes with a quid pro quo.

107
00:05:37.186 --> 00:05:38.685
You know what that is?

108
00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:43.052
Yes, sir. Quid pro quo
is Latin. "This for that."


109
00:05:43.188 --> 00:05:45.392
That's right. Well, this comes
with a quid pro quo.


110
00:05:45.528 --> 00:05:47.357
Fair exchange.
So, here's the deal.


111
00:05:47.493 --> 00:05:48.659
When you get your badge

112
00:05:48.795 --> 00:05:50.855
and I can see that day's comin',

113
00:05:50.991 --> 00:05:52.434
don't become an asshole.

114
00:05:53.728 --> 00:05:54.733
You got me?

115
00:05:57.231 --> 00:05:59.130
No, sir, I won't
become an asshole.


116
00:05:59.266 --> 00:06:00.865
A little power can turn a person

117
00:06:01.001 --> 00:06:02.411
into a monster, Richard.

118
00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:05.078
Don't do that.

119
00:06:05.213 --> 00:06:06.778
Do you understand?

120
00:06:08.578 --> 00:06:10.111
Yeah. Um...

121
00:06:11.554 --> 00:06:13.682
Yeah, I'm gonna
get that back to you


122
00:06:13.818 --> 00:06:15.556
the first paycheck I get, sir.

123
00:06:17.358 --> 00:06:18.917
I'm gonna pay you back

124
00:06:19.053 --> 00:06:20.962
[chuckles] with interest.

125
00:06:21.097 --> 00:06:22.992
Okay. You do that.

126

[pen scratching on paper]

127
00:06:29.799 --> 00:06:31.066
Thank you, Mr. Bryant.

that she played soccer.

[boy 2] God, you dumb-ass.

137
00:07:02.396 --> 00:07:04.935
[boy 1] I got flustered.
Get the door.


138
00:07:05.833 --> 00:07:07.404
[Richard] Wait.

139
00:07:07.539 --> 00:07:08.703
Nice try, hotshot.

140
00:07:08.838 --> 00:07:09.944
It's that rent-a-cop.

141
00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:11.974
[boy 1] Shit.

142
00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:13.977
[whispering] Open the door.
Open the door.


143
00:07:16.614 --> 00:07:17.816
Yes, officer?

144
00:07:20.622 --> 00:07:22.182
I heard
a little noise complaint.


145
00:07:22.317 --> 00:07:23.717
Thought I'd come
take a look around.


146
00:07:23.759 --> 00:07:26.089
You're gonna need
a search warrant first.


147
00:07:26.224 --> 00:07:27.638
Son, you're gonna have to
take your hands off me.


148
00:07:27.662 --> 00:07:29.059
I'm just takin'
a little look-see.


149
00:07:29.194 --> 00:07:30.935
Well, you're not even
a real cop, first of all,


150
00:07:30.959 --> 00:07:32.125
and you're not allowed

151
00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.259
to search a room
without a warrant.


152
00:07:34.395 --> 00:07:35.715
- Boy!
- We pay rent. We pay rent.


153
00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:36.920
It's like we live here, man.

154
00:07:36.965 --> 00:07:38.498
Boy, this is my job.

155
00:07:38.634 --> 00:07:40.353
I'm gonna have to have you
let me do my job, Curlicue.


156
00:07:40.377 --> 00:07:41.667
[boy 1] And this is our room.

157
00:07:41.802 --> 00:07:43.310
Yeah.

158
00:07:43.445 --> 00:07:44.841
Are you aware of the notion

159
00:07:44.976 --> 00:07:46.846
of unlawful search and seizure?

160
00:07:46.982 --> 00:07:48.922
Asshole, you're not supposed
to just walk in here.


161
00:07:48.946 --> 00:07:50.946
Keep pushin' me.
Keep testin' me.


162
00:07:51.081 --> 00:07:52.162
See if you like
where it gets you.


163
00:07:52.186 --> 00:07:53.186
Yeah?

164
00:07:55.488 --> 00:07:56.525
You all right?

165
00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:01.990
What did I say
freshman orientation week?


166
00:08:02.126 --> 00:08:04.994
I said,
"No drinkin' on my campus."


167
00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:06.859
I don't know why
no one called my attention


168
00:08:06.995 --> 00:08:08.261
to your file before.

169
00:08:08.397 --> 00:08:10.702
I mean, all these complaints
about you.


170
00:08:10.838 --> 00:08:12.706
Physically assaulting a student.

171
00:08:15.635 --> 00:08:17.089
And have you really been
pulling people over


172
00:08:17.113 --> 00:08:18.541
on the highway?

173
00:08:18.677 --> 00:08:21.540
Um... Yes, sir, I have.

174
00:08:21.675 --> 00:08:25.552
I figured that if you do
the drunk tests on the road,


175
00:08:25.688 --> 00:08:27.688
trouble never gets
to the campus.


176
00:08:27.823 --> 00:08:30.388
We don't have any jurisdiction
on the highway.


177
00:08:30.524 --> 00:08:33.220
And I realize that,

178
00:08:33.355 --> 00:08:36.024
but I believe
in law and order, sir.


179
00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:38.156
You can't have a country
without it.


180
00:08:38.291 --> 00:08:39.667
Hmm. And you were dismissed

181
00:08:39.803 --> 00:08:42.096
from the Habersham County
Sheriff's Office.


182
00:08:42.232 --> 00:08:44.798
"I don't want any Mickey
-Mousin'

183
00:08:44.933 --> 00:08:47.032
on these grounds."

184
00:08:47.168 --> 00:08:48.868
Isn't that what you said?

185
00:08:49.004 --> 00:08:50.569
When did I say that?

186
00:08:50.705 --> 00:08:52.775
You said it at Founders' Day
last year, I believe.


187
00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:54.275
You were by the punch bowl.

188
00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:56.017
I walked up to you,
and you said to me...


189
00:08:56.152 --> 00:08:57.351
Uh, uh...

190
00:08:57.486 --> 00:08:58.816
Well, I had interrupted you.

191
00:08:58.952 --> 00:09:00.819
I apologized,
I introduced myself,


192
00:09:00.955 --> 00:09:02.435
and I said I was
gonna be the greatest


193
00:09:02.483 --> 00:09:05.084
campus security guard
you ever had.


194
00:09:05.219 --> 00:09:07.088
And you said, "That's good."

195
00:09:07.224 --> 00:09:09.294
"I don't want any Mickey
-Mousin'

196
00:09:09.429 --> 00:09:10.632
on this campus."

197
00:09:15.035 --> 00:09:18.030
I think I might've
even wrote it down.


198
00:09:18.166 --> 00:09:20.032
I write down most things.

199
00:09:20.168 --> 00:09:22.740
I keep the important ones.

200
00:09:22.875 --> 00:09:24.338
And I believe... Oh, yes, sir.

201
00:09:25.913 --> 00:09:27.874
"I don't want any Mickey
-Mousin'

202
00:09:28.009 --> 00:09:29.475
on these grounds."

203
00:09:30.585 --> 00:09:32.687
Those are your words, sir.

204
00:09:33.851 --> 00:09:35.049
So, I took it seriously,

205
00:09:35.185 --> 00:09:36.922
and now, my question for you is,

206
00:09:37.057 --> 00:09:39.458
what about these kids
in the dormitory,


207
00:09:39.593 --> 00:09:41.325
drinkin' and all that?

208
00:09:41.461 --> 00:09:44.160
What you gonna do about that?
We're just gonna let it slide?


209
00:09:46.094 --> 00:09:47.766
Do you wanna resign,

210
00:09:47.902 --> 00:09:49.598
or would it be better
if I fired you?


211
00:09:49.733 --> 00:09:51.265
[gunshot]

212
00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:53.971
So, I'm goin'
into this guy's office


213
00:09:54.107 --> 00:09:56.801
and I think that
he's bringing me in there,


214
00:09:56.937 --> 00:09:59.776
'cause he's gonna, you know,
give me some commendation


215
00:09:59.911 --> 00:10:01.508
or a promotion or something.

216
00:10:01.644 --> 00:10:04.417
Come to find out he brought me
in there to fire me.


217
00:10:04.552 --> 00:10:06.179
Can you believe that?

218
00:10:06.314 --> 00:10:08.354
Well, it was a shit job, anyway.

219
00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:10.649
Hasslin' college brats.

220
00:10:10.784 --> 00:10:12.692
Besides, there's gonna be
so much security work


221
00:10:12.828 --> 00:10:14.354
the next couple months,
you're set.


222
00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:16.289
Yeah, well,
I worked hard at that job.


223
00:10:16.424 --> 00:10:17.794
Those kids
were just runnin' wild.


224
00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:20.029
Olympics are coming, brother.

225
00:10:20.165 --> 00:10:22.028
You can police
the whole damn world.


226

- Something finally happens


229

in this stupid city

230
00:10:30.341 --> 00:10:31.758
and I get a fucking
Kenny Rogers concert.


231
00:10:31.782 --> 00:10:33.085
It could be worse.
Could be equestrian.

I'm getting my tits done.

233
00:10:34.442 --> 00:10:35.762
I don't see how
that applies here.


234
00:10:35.852 --> 00:10:36.924
This time next year,
we're all gonna be


235
00:10:36.948 --> 00:10:38.814
scrambling for jobs on TV.

236
00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:40.581
What do you think, D cup?

237
00:10:40.717 --> 00:10:43.455
Well, I'd miss you, Kathy,
but, I don't think they would.

[chuckles] I'm so sorry.

242

You wanna get a drink?

243
00:10:55.295 --> 00:10:56.496
I'd just slow you down.

that's the best thing.

to answer the phones.

No, I'll go.

259

I might not move out

until after you've had
your surgery.


277

You might need me for something.

if the insurance goes up?

That's right.
I'd have to kill you.

477
00:21:51.058 --> 00:21:53.151
Right now.

478
00:21:53.286 --> 00:21:55.262
What's goin' on,
lard and in charge?


479
00:21:55.397 --> 00:21:57.993
- [all laugh]
- This fuckin' guy!


480
00:21:58.128 --> 00:22:00.208
Yeah, what are you gonna do,
cancel my phone service?


481
00:22:00.327 --> 00:22:02.162
Yeah, let me tell you
somethin', hotshot.


482
00:22:02.297 --> 00:22:05.668
The police, they're not gonna
ask you as nicely.


483
00:22:05.803 --> 00:22:08.232
They see the drunk
and disorderly,


484
00:22:08.368 --> 00:22:11.102
that's cuffs
and a night in the lockup.


485
00:22:11.238 --> 00:22:13.580
- [all jeer]
- He's threatening us.


486
00:22:13.715 --> 00:22:15.849
You're gonna have to
catch me first, lard-ass.


487
00:22:15.984 --> 00:22:17.385
[laughter]

488
00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:19.644
You think you're faster
than a cop car, son?


489
00:22:19.779 --> 00:22:21.081
[boy] Yeah.

490
00:22:21.216 --> 00:22:22.500
You think you're that fast,
roadrunner?


491
00:22:22.524 --> 00:22:23.804
Yeah, I'm Michael Johnson, okay?

492
00:22:23.885 --> 00:22:25.783
The fastest man on earth.

493
00:22:25.919 --> 00:22:27.591
You wanna see my medals?

494
00:22:27.727 --> 00:22:29.660
He's got medals.
He'll show 'em to you.


495
00:22:29.795 --> 00:22:30.934
- I can show 'em to you.
- He'll prove it.


496
00:22:30.958 --> 00:22:31.998
Dude, where are you going?

497
00:22:32.825 --> 00:22:34.094
Oh, come on.

498
00:22:35.203 --> 00:22:36.937
You just wait. You wait.

499
00:22:37.073 --> 00:22:38.769
Yeah, yeah, bye-bye.

500
00:22:41.103 --> 00:22:43.100
Who the fuck
left this monstrosity?


501
00:22:43.236 --> 00:22:45.237
- It's like some...
- G.I. Joe.


502
00:22:46.179 --> 00:22:48.172
It's heavy.

503
00:22:48.307 --> 00:22:49.455
[boy 2] I think
we should take it.


504
00:22:49.479 --> 00:22:50.748
[boy 3] Yes.

505
00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:54.112
Excuse me.

506
00:22:54.248 --> 00:22:55.916
Hey, guys.
We got some drunk guys


507
00:22:56.051 --> 00:22:57.619
breakin' bottles
against the tower.


508
00:22:57.754 --> 00:22:58.983
They're not listenin' to me.

509
00:22:59.118 --> 00:23:01.061
Maybe they'll listen to you.

510
00:23:01.197 --> 00:23:02.727
People respect the badge.

511
00:23:04.558 --> 00:23:06.202
I think we should take it down
to the House of Blues


512
00:23:06.226 --> 00:23:07.508
and see how much
we can get for it.


513
00:23:07.532 --> 00:23:08.766
That's a clutch idea.

514
00:23:08.902 --> 00:23:10.115
Hey, get away from there.
Go on! Get off it.


515
00:23:10.139 --> 00:23:11.434
What you all doin'?

516
00:23:11.569 --> 00:23:12.737
Go on, get outta here!

517
00:23:15.073 --> 00:23:17.204
- Hey, you guys. See if...
- Go on. Run home to Mommy.


518
00:23:17.339 --> 00:23:20.642
Hey, see if they left
a backpack under my bench.


519
00:23:20.778 --> 00:23:23.017
- [beeps]
- Atlanta 911.


520
00:23:23.152 --> 00:23:24.848
Can you understand me?

521
00:23:25.815 --> 00:23:27.585
[on phone]<i>Yes. Go ahead.</i>

522
00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:29.655
You defy the order
of the militia.


523
00:23:30.585 --> 00:23:31.591
What?

524
00:23:34.790 --> 00:23:36.255
I got another weird one.

525
00:23:39.294 --> 00:23:40.825
[Bill] Well, it ain't theirs,
Richard.


526
00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:42.261
I don't like this.

527
00:23:44.574 --> 00:23:46.733
We got ourselves
a suspicious package.


528
00:23:46.868 --> 00:23:48.600
We better call it in.

529
00:23:48.736 --> 00:23:51.301
Probably just somebody run off
drunk and forgot they left it.


530
00:23:51.437 --> 00:23:53.844
I still think
we ought to call it in.


531
00:23:53.979 --> 00:23:55.539
Just take it
to lost and found, Richard.


532
00:23:55.642 --> 00:23:57.254
Shouldn't we unzip it,
and see what's inside first?


533
00:23:57.278 --> 00:23:59.047
No, no, you don't
wanna touch that.


534
00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:02.251
You gotta follow protocol.

535
00:24:02.386 --> 00:24:05.416
Son of a bitch had to get left
under your bench, didn't it?


536
00:24:05.551 --> 00:24:07.688
We need assistance
on an unclaimed bag...


537
00:24:07.823 --> 00:24:09.222
A suspicious package.

538
00:24:09.357 --> 00:24:12.061
A suspicious package
over at section four.


539
00:24:12.196 --> 00:24:14.566
We ought to set up
some kind of a perimeter, too.


540
00:24:14.701 --> 00:24:15.906
- Just back away.
- [Will] Perimeter?


541
00:24:15.930 --> 00:24:17.065
Richard, you crazy?

542
00:24:18.639 --> 00:24:20.833
You know what?
I would rather be crazy


543
00:24:20.968 --> 00:24:22.268
than wrong right now.

544
00:24:23.743 --> 00:24:25.976
Shit, Richard.
It's just full of beer.

Well, we're lookin'
at a suspicious package

in front of the tower.

Hey, guys.

560
00:24:58.142 --> 00:25:00.170
We got a bomb scare
in front of the tower.

You should be aware of that.

We get bomb threats

he's actually second cousins
with a Polish gymnast.

"You ever see the bomb guy
go pale, run."

We got three pipe bombs
in that bag.

Biggest I've ever seen.

You're gonna be all right,

[officer] A Team,
there was an explosion.


713
00:32:09.308 --> 00:32:10.842
Send as many ambulances
as you have.


714
00:32:10.978 --> 00:32:12.507
Hang on. I'm gonna need help.

715
00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:23.750
This is homicide. It's ours.

716
00:32:23.885 --> 00:32:26.116
This park is state property.
That makes it ours.


717
00:32:26.252 --> 00:32:28.452
You guys can both get the fuck
out of here. This is ATF.


718
00:32:28.493 --> 00:32:30.291
Actually, you can
all shut the fuck up,


719
00:32:30.426 --> 00:32:31.666
'cause this is a federal crime.

720
00:32:31.693 --> 00:32:32.973
That means
it's our jurisdiction.


721
00:32:33.002 --> 00:32:34.524
The Federal Bureau
of Investigation.


722
00:32:34.659 --> 00:32:35.858
So, if you wanna help,

723
00:32:35.994 --> 00:32:37.766
get these injured people
taken care of


724
00:32:37.902 --> 00:32:40.973
and keep the perimeter secure.
Help us find out who did this.

00:35:30.271 --> 00:35:31.409
My boy.

790
00:35:33.439 --> 00:35:34.439
[sighs]

791
00:35:35.311 --> 00:35:36.381
[officer] Find it.

792
00:35:37.611 --> 00:35:39.619
That's it. Find it.

793
00:35:39.755 --> 00:35:40.946
[dog sniffing]

794
00:35:44.783 --> 00:35:46.457
Right here. We got one.

795
00:35:47.654 --> 00:35:50.153
[indistinct chatter]

796
00:35:50.288 --> 00:35:51.999
[Tim] How'd you feel
about that one, Richard?


797
00:35:52.023 --> 00:35:54.731
[Richard] I think it went well.

798
00:35:54.867 --> 00:35:57.699
Everybody was really nice.
Made me feel okay about it.


799
00:35:57.834 --> 00:35:59.672
- Yeah. You were great.
- Good job, Richard.


800
00:35:59.807 --> 00:36:00.898
Hey, thank you.

801
00:36:01.034 --> 00:36:02.606
Hey, I had a question for y'all.

802
00:36:02.741 --> 00:36:05.274
I worked with some guys
who got injured last night.


803
00:36:05.409 --> 00:36:07.477
Um... Green, Silver, Miller.

804
00:36:07.613 --> 00:36:09.307
You know if they made it out
all right?


805
00:36:09.442 --> 00:36:12.910
Yeah. Word is all the cops are
gonna make a full recovery.


806
00:36:13.046 --> 00:36:14.415
That's great.
Thank you very much.


807
00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:15.915
[female officer] Thank you.

808
00:36:16.050 --> 00:36:17.534
Richard, there's someone
I'd like you to meet.


809
00:36:17.558 --> 00:36:19.260
This is Mr. Brenner
from Bernstein and Crane.


810
00:36:19.284 --> 00:36:20.884
You know the company,
they publish books.


811
00:36:20.996 --> 00:36:22.623
Uh, nice to meet you, sir.

812
00:36:22.759 --> 00:36:24.463
Hello, Richard.
Pleasure to meet you.


813
00:36:24.598 --> 00:36:26.589
I would like to talk to you
about your story.


814
00:36:26.725 --> 00:36:28.195
Are you free?

815
00:36:28.330 --> 00:36:29.698
[stammers]

816
00:36:29.833 --> 00:36:31.732
- Am I free? Can I talk to him?
- Sure, sure.


817
00:36:31.867 --> 00:36:33.702
All right.
Let's get a cup of coffee.


818
00:36:33.837 --> 00:36:35.406
Better yet,
let's get somethin' to eat.


819
00:36:35.542 --> 00:36:37.374
Uh, you're not gonna hear
a complaint


820
00:36:37.509 --> 00:36:39.077
- out of me for that.
- [laughs]


821
00:36:39.213 --> 00:36:40.373
Let's get you something good.

822
00:36:41.745 --> 00:36:44.042
No, no, no.
I gotta go. I gotta go.


823
00:36:45.017 --> 00:36:46.211
[Richard sighs]

824
00:36:46.347 --> 00:36:47.445
Richard.

825
00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:49.118
Oh, my Lord.

826
00:36:49.253 --> 00:36:50.853
You're everywhere.

827
00:36:50.988 --> 00:36:53.751
I mean, the phone has just
been ringing off the hook.


828
00:36:53.886 --> 00:36:56.120
[scoffs] I need a secretary.

829
00:36:56.256 --> 00:36:58.458
Yeah, I think I might need
a secretary, too.


830
00:36:58.593 --> 00:37:00.430
Some guy from New York

831
00:37:00.566 --> 00:37:02.593
just asked me if I wanna
write a book.


832
00:37:02.728 --> 00:37:04.397
You don't mean it.

833
00:37:04.533 --> 00:37:06.104
No, I'm not kidding you.

834
00:37:06.239 --> 00:37:08.708
They tell me, apparently...

835
00:37:08.843 --> 00:37:10.075
Oh, Lord.

836
00:37:10.211 --> 00:37:11.608
Apparently, they got somebody

837
00:37:11.744 --> 00:37:13.906
who they think up
all the stuff in the book,


838
00:37:14.042 --> 00:37:16.075
they type it out
and then they just ask you


839
00:37:16.210 --> 00:37:18.010
"yes or no," "true or false,"
"did it happen?"


840
00:37:18.051 --> 00:37:19.083
Then they pay you.

841
00:37:19.218 --> 00:37:20.483
You do that for money.

842
00:37:20.619 --> 00:37:22.254
Oh, my God, you're a rock star.

843
00:37:22.389 --> 00:37:25.483
Tom Brokaw was
even talking about you.


844
00:37:25.618 --> 00:37:26.993
[stammers]

845
00:37:27.129 --> 00:37:28.659
I can't even think right now.

846
00:37:28.794 --> 00:37:31.956
Are you all right?
You've been up for so long.


847
00:37:32.092 --> 00:37:33.332
Oh, my God, it was so horrible.

848
00:37:33.434 --> 00:37:35.159
Mama, I'm sorry.
I didn't even hug you.


849
00:37:35.294 --> 00:37:37.865
- It was so awful.
- I know, I was there.


850
00:37:38.972 --> 00:37:40.239
Oh, my God.

851
00:37:40.375 --> 00:37:42.469
Be thankful
that you weren't there.


852
00:37:42.605 --> 00:37:43.803
You could have been there.

853
00:37:43.939 --> 00:37:45.775
- I know.
- I couldn't have handled that.


854
00:37:45.910 --> 00:37:48.447
You were there two nights ago
for Kenny Rogers.


855
00:37:48.582 --> 00:37:50.094
Can you imagine
if you were there last night?


856
00:37:50.118 --> 00:37:51.683
I know. Sit down, sit down.

857
00:37:51.819 --> 00:37:54.580
You must be really hungry.
I'm gonna give you some food.


858
00:37:54.716 --> 00:37:56.652
[Richard] Oh, my goodness.

859
00:37:56.788 --> 00:37:59.018
Oh, Mama, I'm telling you
what, it was...


860
00:38:00.986 --> 00:38:03.725
It was complete chaos, Mama.

861
00:38:03.861 --> 00:38:06.562
And to think
I could've called in sick.


862
00:38:06.698 --> 00:38:08.796
Think about how
I was feeling yesterday.


863
00:38:08.931 --> 00:38:10.999
- I know.
- I could've called in sick.


864
00:38:11.135 --> 00:38:12.996
I know.

865
00:38:13.131 --> 00:38:14.374
- Then what?
- Oh, my Lord.


866
00:38:15.507 --> 00:38:17.308
- [knock on door]
- [Bruce] Shaw.


867
00:38:17.443 --> 00:38:18.774
- No, I gotta go.
- Doing okay?


868
00:38:19.605 --> 00:38:21.478
No.

869
00:38:21.613 --> 00:38:23.311
That bomb went off on my watch.

870
00:38:23.447 --> 00:38:25.277
That's my fucking park.

871
00:38:25.412 --> 00:38:28.388
We didn't have enough
eyeballs there. That's on us.


872
00:38:29.821 --> 00:38:31.461
Let's just catch
the son of a bitch, yeah?


873
00:38:31.991 --> 00:38:33.349
Yeah.

874
00:38:33.484 --> 00:38:35.428
I need you to get out
to Habersham County.


875
00:38:35.563 --> 00:38:37.123
Background on a former
sheriff's deputy.


876
00:38:37.224 --> 00:38:39.194
Might have some connection
to the bombing.


877
00:38:39.329 --> 00:38:40.329
Who is it?

878
00:38:41.168 --> 00:38:42.666
The security guard.

879
00:38:55.314 --> 00:38:56.378
[man] Hey, Richard!

880
00:38:56.514 --> 00:38:58.341
[camera shutters clicking]

881
00:39:01.056 --> 00:39:02.781
Hey, way to go, man.

882
00:39:02.916 --> 00:39:04.391
You made us all real proud.

883
00:39:06.257 --> 00:39:07.350
Thank you.

884
00:39:11.766 --> 00:39:15.491
Dr. Cleere, we wanna thank you
for contacting the FBI


885
00:39:15.626 --> 00:39:19.202
regarding your suspicions
about Richard Jewell.


886
00:39:19.337 --> 00:39:20.735
I wanna be clear,

887
00:39:20.871 --> 00:39:22.833
I haven't accused him
of anything.


888
00:39:22.969 --> 00:39:24.334
We completely understand.

889
00:39:25.045 --> 00:39:26.105
I just.

890
00:39:27.977 --> 00:39:30.749
I see the attention
he's getting.


891
00:39:30.885 --> 00:39:33.444
It's the kind of attention
he was always seeking here.


892
00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:36.252
Harassing students, pulling
people over on the highway.


893
00:39:36.388 --> 00:39:38.458
Just crazy behavior.

894
00:39:38.593 --> 00:39:40.617
And I decided
if my fears were correct,


895
00:39:40.753 --> 00:39:43.991
if he actually wasn't the hero
they're making him out to be,


896
00:39:44.127 --> 00:39:45.958
and I had information
pertinent to the fact


897
00:39:46.094 --> 00:39:47.929
which I failed to bring to light

898
00:39:49.028 --> 00:39:51.561
it could jeopardize lives.

899
00:39:51.697 --> 00:39:54.133
Well, Dr. Cleere, you did
the right thing in calling us.


900
00:39:54.268 --> 00:39:57.774
We will, rest assured,
follow up on this.


901
00:39:57.909 --> 00:39:59.021
Do you mind if we take
this folder with us?


902
00:39:59.045 --> 00:40:00.437
Please.

903
00:40:00.572 --> 00:40:02.944
We'll make a copy
and get you the original back.


904
00:40:03.079 --> 00:40:06.579
Why is the goddamn ACOG
reopening that park?


905
00:40:06.715 --> 00:40:08.114
We don't have shit!

906
00:40:10.118 --> 00:40:12.791
Okay, I wanna hear
more about Jewell.


907
00:40:12.927 --> 00:40:14.021
Patrick?

908
00:40:16.023 --> 00:40:18.258
Well, when I look at Jewell

909
00:40:18.394 --> 00:40:22.566
I think about the bomb scare
at the L.A. Olympics in '84.


910
00:40:22.702 --> 00:40:24.465
A bag left on a bus
by the same cop


911
00:40:24.601 --> 00:40:25.800
who then discovered it.

912
00:40:25.936 --> 00:40:28.172
And the fires in Idaho
this summer,


913
00:40:28.308 --> 00:40:30.004
started by a firefighter

914
00:40:30.140 --> 00:40:32.473
who wanted the credit
for putting them out.


915
00:40:32.609 --> 00:40:35.112
A profile emerges here.

916
00:40:35.247 --> 00:40:36.516
The false hero.

917
00:40:37.481 --> 00:40:38.781
In interviews,

918
00:40:38.917 --> 00:40:40.555
Jewell's account
of the bombing seems vague


919
00:40:40.579 --> 00:40:43.148
and he looks uncomfortable
discussing the victims.


920
00:40:43.284 --> 00:40:46.154
I also found
that his mentioning on TV


921
00:40:46.289 --> 00:40:49.027
that he wanted to get back
into law enforcement a bit


922
00:40:49.163 --> 00:40:50.660
inappropriate.

923
00:40:50.796 --> 00:40:52.358
There's a lot here
that's troubling.


924
00:40:52.493 --> 00:40:54.827
And everything that Agent Shaw
has learned about him,


925
00:40:54.962 --> 00:40:56.536
syncs up with this profile.

926
00:40:59.307 --> 00:41:01.435
You agree with that, Tom?

927
00:41:01.570 --> 00:41:03.169
Yes, sir, I do.

928
00:41:07.644 --> 00:41:09.307
Let's put eyes on him.

929
00:41:14.047 --> 00:41:15.549
- [Nadya] Watson?
- Yeah?


930
00:41:15.684 --> 00:41:17.388
- Watson?
- Yeah.


931
00:41:17.523 --> 00:41:19.018
You have a call on line one.

932
00:41:19.153 --> 00:41:20.886
Is it Bill Gates
randomly wondering


933
00:41:21.021 --> 00:41:22.558
if I need a million dollars?

934
00:41:22.694 --> 00:41:23.854
If so, that's an affirmative.

935
00:41:23.924 --> 00:41:25.125
It's Richard Jewell.

936
00:41:27.865 --> 00:41:29.393
"Richard Jewell" Richard Jewell?

937
00:41:29.528 --> 00:41:31.670
"Richard Jewell"
Richard Jewell, line one.


938
00:41:35.068 --> 00:41:37.673
- Hello?
- Mr. Bryant.


939
00:41:37.808 --> 00:41:40.338
Hey, uh,
I'm sorry to bother you.


940
00:41:40.473 --> 00:41:43.445
I just got your number
from Information.


941
00:41:43.581 --> 00:41:45.280
I hope you remember me.

942
00:41:45.415 --> 00:41:48.986
Radar, you can call me Watson.
You're a national hero now.


943
00:41:49.122 --> 00:41:51.353
<i>I'm glad you called.
We're running out of Snickers.</i>


944
00:41:51.488 --> 00:41:52.590
Thank you, sir.

945
00:41:52.725 --> 00:41:54.688
How are you? How's your family?

946
00:41:54.824 --> 00:41:57.356
<i>We're all fine, yeah.</i>

947
00:41:57.491 --> 00:41:59.896
<i>I see you've moved up
from video games.</i>


948
00:42:00.031 --> 00:42:03.667
Yep, I didn't mean to,
but I guess I did.


949
00:42:03.802 --> 00:42:05.930
Good job.
That's a prideful thing.


950
00:42:06.065 --> 00:42:07.405
What can I do you for?

951
00:42:07.541 --> 00:42:09.065
<i>Oh, sir, I was calling you</i>

952
00:42:09.201 --> 00:42:10.872
because I wanted to know,

953
00:42:11.007 --> 00:42:13.078
have you ever done a book deal?

954
00:42:13.213 --> 00:42:15.474
[stammers] Why?

955
00:42:15.610 --> 00:42:18.374
With this whole bomb thing,
I got these New York guys


956
00:42:18.509 --> 00:42:20.180
who are asking me
to write a book


957
00:42:20.315 --> 00:42:22.686
and I don't really know
anything about that,


958
00:42:22.822 --> 00:42:23.995
so I thought
maybe I could call you,


959
00:42:24.019 --> 00:42:25.383
you might be able to help me.

960
00:42:25.518 --> 00:42:27.727
<i>Sure. Sounds
a little far-fetched,</i>


961
00:42:27.862 --> 00:42:32.361
but contracts are contracts,
but yeah, we could talk.


962
00:42:32.496 --> 00:42:33.895
So, are you not

963
00:42:34.030 --> 00:42:35.532
the U.S. Small Business
Admin anymore?


964
00:42:35.667 --> 00:42:37.070
'Cause I tried there first.

965
00:42:37.205 --> 00:42:38.631
<i>No, I moved on.</i>

966
00:42:38.767 --> 00:42:39.898
Oh. How come?

967
00:42:40.034 --> 00:42:42.164
<i>Lifestyle decision.</i>

968
00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:44.609
What's your phone number?

969
00:42:44.744 --> 00:42:47.345
- My phone number is 404...
- 404


970
00:42:47.481 --> 00:42:49.742
<i>- 194...</i>
- 194


971
00:42:49.878 --> 00:42:52.212
<i>- 8188.</i>
- 8188.


972
00:42:52.347 --> 00:42:54.786
All right, well,
you just don't sign anything


973
00:42:54.921 --> 00:42:57.419
until I see it first.
We'll start there.


974
00:42:57.554 --> 00:42:59.154
Yes, sir.

975
00:42:59.290 --> 00:43:02.585
Yeah, I won't put a pen
to the page. I'll wait on it.


976
00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:05.263
Hey, and thank you, sir.
Thank you for your time.


977
00:43:05.398 --> 00:43:06.428
<i>You got it.</i>

978
00:43:06.563 --> 00:43:07.697
All right, bye.

979
00:43:07.832 --> 00:43:09.125
- Stay in touch.
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>


980
00:43:09.261 --> 00:43:10.703
- Okay.
<i>- Bye.</i>


981
00:43:15.835 --> 00:43:17.210
No, no.

982
00:43:17.345 --> 00:43:19.943
Don't get too excited.

983
00:43:21.414 --> 00:43:22.812
- No.
- Yes.


984
00:43:22.948 --> 00:43:25.652
No. Simmer down there,
hot sauce.


985
00:43:28.049 --> 00:43:30.118
[Bobi] Well, Bill Miller.

986
00:43:30.253 --> 00:43:32.688
It's nice to see you.
It's been a while.


987
00:43:32.823 --> 00:43:34.325
It's nice to see you, Bobi.

988
00:43:34.460 --> 00:43:35.526
Where's the hero?

989
00:43:35.662 --> 00:43:38.126
Oh, he's in here. Come on in.

990
00:43:43.168 --> 00:43:45.027
[Bill] What kind of charge
you figure it was?


991
00:43:45.162 --> 00:43:46.233
[Richard] Hmm.

992
00:43:48.106 --> 00:43:50.842
I'm not sure what kinda
explosive the guy used.


993
00:43:50.978 --> 00:43:55.209
It could have been
black powder, match heads,


994
00:43:55.345 --> 00:43:58.483
maybe some kinda chlorate
packed with nails.


995
00:43:58.618 --> 00:44:00.885
You know, the funny thing is

996
00:44:01.020 --> 00:44:04.186
the package was supposed
to blow out, right?


997
00:44:04.321 --> 00:44:07.657
So, when those drunks,
those kids knocked it over,


998
00:44:07.792 --> 00:44:09.595
they saved a bunch of lives.

999
00:44:09.731 --> 00:44:11.520
Because it was supposed
to blow out


1000
00:44:11.656 --> 00:44:14.427
into a crowd
for maximum casualties.


1001
00:44:14.562 --> 00:44:17.363
But when they knocked it
on its back, it blew upward.


1002
00:44:17.498 --> 00:44:19.706
Most of the ordnance
going up into the sky.


1003
00:44:20.638 --> 00:44:23.103
It blew up, so...

1004
00:44:23.239 --> 00:44:24.559
All in all,
what you're looking at


1005
00:44:24.676 --> 00:44:25.709
is some kind of battery

1006
00:44:25.844 --> 00:44:27.807
and some kind of timing device,

1007
00:44:27.943 --> 00:44:29.406
like a simple clock.

1008
00:44:29.542 --> 00:44:32.046
Maybe a wristwatch
like I'm wearing.


1009
00:44:32.182 --> 00:44:34.583
Depends how high-tech
the guy got.


1010
00:44:34.719 --> 00:44:35.918
Some of these guys,

1011
00:44:36.054 --> 00:44:37.582
especially if they're
ex-military,


1012
00:44:37.718 --> 00:44:40.791
or they're some kind of whiz
outta some university,


1013
00:44:40.927 --> 00:44:42.394
they're gonna use a combination

1014
00:44:42.530 --> 00:44:44.060
of different bomb tactics.

1015
00:44:44.195 --> 00:44:46.891
Other people are following it
like a recipe.


1016
00:44:47.026 --> 00:44:48.293
They're probably

1017
00:44:48.429 --> 00:44:49.966
- losing a finger to it.
- [Bill] Yeah.


1018
00:44:50.102 --> 00:44:52.800
But depends on who
you're talking about


1019
00:44:52.936 --> 00:44:54.635
and who's making the bomb.

1020
00:44:54.770 --> 00:44:56.004
Well [sighs]

1021
00:44:56.139 --> 00:44:57.568
I like getting your opinion
on it,


1022
00:44:57.703 --> 00:44:59.872
and I'm sure
you've studied it quite a bit.


1023
00:45:00.008 --> 00:45:02.012
Who knows? I mean...

1024
00:45:02.147 --> 00:45:03.827
That's the thing, too,
about these bombers.


1025
00:45:03.915 --> 00:45:05.776
It could have been you or me.

1026
00:45:05.911 --> 00:45:09.111
These guys, some of them,
look like regular people.


1027
00:45:09.246 --> 00:45:10.713
Lot of them do.

1028
00:45:14.294 --> 00:45:15.586
Yeah.

1029
00:45:30.736 --> 00:45:33.070
[slow dance music playing
on speakers]


1030
00:45:33.206 --> 00:45:34.605
[indistinct chatter]

1031
00:45:37.385 --> 00:45:38.575
[Kathy sighs]

1032
00:45:38.711 --> 00:45:41.117
Must be a lot of pressure
on you guys.


1033
00:45:42.721 --> 00:45:44.087
No more so than usual.

1034
00:45:45.321 --> 00:45:47.516
Sure, just another... Thank you.

1035
00:45:47.652 --> 00:45:50.289
Just your average deadly bombing

1036
00:45:50.425 --> 00:45:51.758
on U.S. soil
during the Olympics.


1037
00:45:51.893 --> 00:45:54.496
No big deal.

1038
00:45:54.631 --> 00:45:56.912
I don't know, you guys must be
feeling the heat, too, huh?


1039
00:45:56.997 --> 00:45:58.331
[Kathy] Mmm-hmm.

1040
00:45:58.466 --> 00:46:00.230
CNN is going wall-to-wall
with this.


1041
00:46:00.366 --> 00:46:02.068
Is that why we get this

1042
00:46:02.203 --> 00:46:03.909
- outfit?
- [chuckles]


1043
00:46:05.309 --> 00:46:06.829
So, then give me something
I can print.


1044
00:46:09.146 --> 00:46:10.850
Kathy, you know I can't do that.

1045
00:46:12.149 --> 00:46:13.429
That's all right. 
I already know

1046
00:46:13.481 --> 00:46:14.655
the Bureau's looking
into somebody.


1047
00:46:14.679 --> 00:46:16.350
Yeah, what makes you think that?

1048
00:46:17.258 --> 00:46:18.282
Friends.

1049
00:46:18.417 --> 00:46:19.487
- Friends?
- Sources.


1050
00:46:19.623 --> 00:46:20.651
Sources?

1051
00:46:22.594 --> 00:46:23.863
Who is it?

1052
00:46:25.792 --> 00:46:27.441
Well, Kathy, if you couldn't
fuck it out of them,


1053
00:46:27.465 --> 00:46:30.536
what makes you think
you're gonna fuck it outta me?


1054
00:46:30.671 --> 00:46:32.696
- [scoffing]
- Uh-huh.


1055
00:46:34.007 --> 00:46:35.336
You know what bothers me, Kathy,

1056
00:46:35.471 --> 00:46:37.150
is that people don't
understand how much work


1057
00:46:37.174 --> 00:46:38.411
goes into making
a case like this.


1058
00:46:38.435 --> 00:46:40.605
It's effort 24/7.

1059
00:46:41.481 --> 00:46:42.545
[Kathy] Hmm.

1060
00:46:42.681 --> 00:46:43.982
You're right.

1061
00:46:48.018 --> 00:46:49.713
Why don't you educate me?

1062
00:46:51.893 --> 00:46:54.560
I will not have this screwed up.

1063
00:46:54.696 --> 00:46:56.059
That was a massacre out there.

1064
00:46:56.195 --> 00:46:57.664
It's a miracle
more people weren't killed.


1065
00:46:57.688 --> 00:46:59.262
I would never go
to print without


1066
00:46:59.397 --> 00:47:01.726
independent corroboration
from a second source.


1067
00:47:01.861 --> 00:47:04.904
And that would put us
in a very different zone.


1068
00:47:07.265 --> 00:47:08.567
As you know.

1069
00:47:10.842 --> 00:47:12.670
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.


1070
00:47:13.976 --> 00:47:15.811
What kind of zone?

1071
00:47:15.946 --> 00:47:17.378
You have to find out.

1072
00:47:20.079 --> 00:47:21.514
[sighs]

1073
00:47:31.189 --> 00:47:34.362
[softly] We're looking at
the security guard, Jewell.


1074
00:47:37.837 --> 00:47:39.400
- No shit?
- No shit.


1075
00:47:41.232 --> 00:47:43.043
You always look at the guy
who found the bomb just like


1076
00:47:43.067 --> 00:47:44.845
you always look at the guy
who found the body.


1077
00:47:44.869 --> 00:47:48.375
But this guy,
he's got a bad past.


1078
00:47:48.511 --> 00:47:52.381
Fits the profile
of the hero-bomber to a T.


1079
00:47:52.516 --> 00:47:56.714
That fat fuck who lives
with his mother. Of course.


1080
00:47:56.849 --> 00:47:59.717
How did I miss that?
I mean, that is amazing.


1081
00:48:00.889 --> 00:48:01.921
Oof.

1082
00:48:02.057 --> 00:48:03.462
You are good.

1083
00:48:03.597 --> 00:48:05.022
You're very good.

1084
00:48:05.157 --> 00:48:06.460
Yeah.

1085
00:48:06.596 --> 00:48:08.363
This kind of puts a clock
on things though.


1086
00:48:08.498 --> 00:48:10.398
You wanna get a room
or just go to my car?


1087
00:48:14.036 --> 00:48:15.100
This is happening.

1088
00:48:15.235 --> 00:48:16.371
This is happening.

1089
00:48:18.043 --> 00:48:19.118
Let's get the fuck outta here.

1090
00:48:19.142 --> 00:48:20.573
- [Kathy] Okay.
- Yeah.


1091
00:48:20.709 --> 00:48:22.509
- [indistinct chatter]
- [typewriter clacking]


1092
00:48:27.820 --> 00:48:29.153
Sugar, I need you to do

1093
00:48:29.288 --> 00:48:31.018
one of those better
word things you do.


1094
00:48:31.153 --> 00:48:33.023
You mean rewrite you?

1095
00:48:33.159 --> 00:48:34.616
Yeah, you know
I write like a brick,


1096
00:48:34.752 --> 00:48:36.890
and this one is kinda special.

1097
00:48:37.025 --> 00:48:38.393
What is it?

1098
00:48:40.233 --> 00:48:42.397
Oh, nothing.
It's just that the, um...


1099
00:48:43.763 --> 00:48:47.065
The FBI is looking
at Richard Jewell


1100
00:48:47.201 --> 00:48:48.403
as the bomber.

1101
00:48:51.944 --> 00:48:53.064
Do you have time for me now?

1102
00:48:53.146 --> 00:48:54.541
Oh, I got all the time you need.

1103
00:48:54.676 --> 00:48:56.476
- All right, let's work.
- Tell me everything.


1104
00:48:57.342 --> 00:48:58.384
Where you goin'?

1105
00:48:58.519 --> 00:48:59.711
To get my notes.

1106
00:49:02.991 --> 00:49:04.294
The security guard
who first alerted


1107
00:49:04.318 --> 00:49:05.651
police to the pipe bomb

1108
00:49:05.786 --> 00:49:07.686
that exploded in Centennial
Olympic Park


1109
00:49:07.821 --> 00:49:09.594
is the target
of the federal investigation


1110
00:49:09.729 --> 00:49:10.762
into the incident

1111
00:49:10.897 --> 00:49:12.458
that resulted in two deaths

1112
00:49:12.594 --> 00:49:14.357
and injured
more than one hundred.


1113
00:49:14.493 --> 00:49:15.691
Richard Jewell, 33,

1114
00:49:15.826 --> 00:49:17.266
a former
law enforcement officer,


1115
00:49:17.401 --> 00:49:19.465
fits the profile
of the lone bomber.


1116
00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:21.130
This profile generally includes

1117
00:49:21.266 --> 00:49:23.866
a frustrated white man who
is a former police officer,


1118
00:49:24.002 --> 00:49:26.679
member of the military,
or police wannabe


1119
00:49:26.814 --> 00:49:29.876
who seeks to become a hero.

1120
00:49:30.011 --> 00:49:32.251
Jewell has become a celebrity
in the wake of the bombing,


1121
00:49:32.351 --> 00:49:34.080
making appearances on
<i>The Today Show."</i>


1122
00:49:34.216 --> 00:49:36.021
FBI knows you have this?

1123
00:49:36.157 --> 00:49:38.018
Yeah, my guy says
everybody's got it.


1124
00:49:38.153 --> 00:49:39.788
Networks have it.

1125
00:49:39.923 --> 00:49:41.157
CNN has it.

1126
00:49:41.293 --> 00:49:43.322
Got a guy at GBI
says the same thing.


1127
00:49:43.457 --> 00:49:45.129
Bureau's looking at Jewell.

1128
00:49:45.264 --> 00:49:47.066
Then why isn't anyone
reporting it?


1129
00:49:48.500 --> 00:49:50.220
Anybody feel like
we're getting worked here?


1130
00:49:51.699 --> 00:49:55.368
God damn, John,
these are our Olympics.


1131
00:49:55.503 --> 00:49:56.766
If we don't lead on this story,

1132
00:49:56.902 --> 00:49:58.605
what the fuck are we doing here?

1133
00:50:02.516 --> 00:50:04.207
Okay.

1134
00:50:04.342 --> 00:50:06.388
Tear up the afternoon edition,
and replate the front page.


1135
00:50:06.412 --> 00:50:07.519
We're running it.

1136
00:50:07.654 --> 00:50:08.879
Thank you.

Huh? Shaw!

Yeah. I'm Richard.

00:51:45.649 --> 00:51:48.247
Special Agents Dan Bennet,
Tom Shaw, FBI.


1162

You got a minute?

Yeah, I got a minute.
Come on in.


1164
00:51:52.792 --> 00:51:53.852
[Tom] Thank you.

1165
00:51:55.728 --> 00:51:57.189
Ma'am.

1166
00:51:57.324 --> 00:51:58.527
[Richard] Um...

1167
00:51:59.458 --> 00:52:00.825
[stammers]

1168
00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:04.967
Mama, this is
Agent Bennet and Shaw.


1169
00:52:05.103 --> 00:52:07.072
This is my mother, Bobi.

1170
00:52:07.207 --> 00:52:09.005
- How do you do?
- Pleasure, ma'am.


1171
00:52:09.140 --> 00:52:10.467
[clears throat] Uh...

1172
00:52:10.603 --> 00:52:11.870
What can I do for y'all?

1173
00:52:12.006 --> 00:52:13.646
Well, the Bureau's
actually putting together


1174
00:52:13.670 --> 00:52:14.938
a training video

1175
00:52:15.073 --> 00:52:17.215
on how to deal
with suspicious packages,


1176
00:52:17.351 --> 00:52:18.757
and we'd love you
to be a part of it.


1177
00:52:18.781 --> 00:52:20.877
- How's that sound to you?
- [Richard] Uh


1178
00:52:21.013 --> 00:52:23.051
I would love
to help out with that,


1179
00:52:23.186 --> 00:52:24.349
yeah, absolutely.

1180
00:52:24.485 --> 00:52:25.850
You did it, Richard.

1181
00:52:25.986 --> 00:52:27.430
You showed them
what kinda cop you can be.


1182
00:52:27.454 --> 00:52:29.154
Look at this.

1183
00:52:29.289 --> 00:52:30.157
[Tom] See, the only thing is
that we're shooting it today.


1184
00:52:30.293 --> 00:52:31.989
So, we'd need you to

1185
00:52:32.124 --> 00:52:33.674
follow us to the field office
right now.


1186
00:52:33.698 --> 00:52:36.001
Because time's a little
bit tight. Is that okay?


1187
00:52:36.136 --> 00:52:37.595
You know what? 
I would love to,

1188
00:52:37.731 --> 00:52:39.033
but I still gotta work today.

1189
00:52:39.168 --> 00:52:40.270
I got my shift.

1190
00:52:40.406 --> 00:52:42.032
Ah, this won't take long,
Richard.


1191
00:52:44.135 --> 00:52:46.538
[chuckles] Yeah,
you know what? Um


1192
00:52:46.673 --> 00:52:47.846
I bet we can make that work.

1193
00:52:47.982 --> 00:52:49.477
I can call in and tell 'em

1194
00:52:49.612 --> 00:52:51.341
I'm gonna be a little bit late.

1195
00:52:51.477 --> 00:52:54.252
I mean, I wanna help you all,
and I'm law enforcement, too.


1196
00:52:54.388 --> 00:52:55.864
- We know that. Yes, indeed.
- We know that.


1197
00:52:55.888 --> 00:52:57.012
[Richard] Yeah.

1198
00:52:57.147 --> 00:52:58.815
So, you're all set
to go then, huh?


1199
00:52:58.950 --> 00:53:00.721
- Yep. Yeah.
- [Tom] Great.


1200
00:53:00.856 --> 00:53:01.971
- Let's do it.
- Lovely to meet you, ma'am.


1201
00:53:01.995 --> 00:53:03.362
Thank you very much.

1202
00:53:03.497 --> 00:53:04.499
- [Bobi] Nice to meet you.
- [Dan] Lovely home.


1203
00:53:04.523 --> 00:53:05.523
[door opens]

1204
00:53:05.594 --> 00:53:07.227
I don't know what's going on.

1205
00:53:07.363 --> 00:53:09.701
I'm so proud of you.

1206
00:53:09.837 --> 00:53:11.567
Oh, goodness.

1207
00:53:18.139 --> 00:53:19.853
[female reporter] Mr. Jewell,
why are the FBI here?


1208
00:53:19.877 --> 00:53:22.675
[male reporter] Mr. Jewell,
what have they told you?


1209
00:53:22.811 --> 00:53:24.189
Are they letting you
go back to work?


1210
00:53:24.213 --> 00:53:25.747
Uh, yeah.

1211
00:53:25.882 --> 00:53:27.158
They're letting you go
to work? You're good to go?


1212
00:53:27.182 --> 00:53:28.217
Yeah.

1213
00:53:28.353 --> 00:53:30.916
Are the FBI investigating you?

1214
00:53:31.051 --> 00:53:34.456
Uh, I imagine
they'll investigate anyone


1215
00:53:34.592 --> 00:53:35.884
who was at the park that night.

1216
00:53:36.020 --> 00:53:37.958
That includes all of you, too.

1217
00:53:38.094 --> 00:53:40.589
[reporter] Have they told you
yet you can't leave town?


1218
00:53:40.725 --> 00:53:42.292
[Richard] No.

1219
00:53:42.427 --> 00:53:44.108
[female reporter] Mr. Jewell,
are you under arrest?


1220
00:53:44.132 --> 00:53:45.680
[male reporter] You're free
to go wherever you like?


1221
00:53:45.704 --> 00:53:47.308
You're free to go
wherever you'd like, Richard?


1222
00:53:47.332 --> 00:53:48.682
- Who are you working with?
- What happened out there?


1223
00:53:48.706 --> 00:53:50.267
What do you think
of the appearance that


1224
00:53:50.402 --> 00:53:51.239
people are saying that you are
now the prime suspect?


1225
00:53:51.375 --> 00:53:52.811
What's going on, Richard?

1226
00:53:52.946 --> 00:53:54.479
I'm not a suspect.

1227
00:53:54.615 --> 00:53:56.152
[female reporter] Why are you
talking to the FBI?


1228
00:53:56.176 --> 00:53:58.315
Mr. Jewell, what does
the FBI want with you?


1229
00:53:58.451 --> 00:54:00.550
Can you give us
any more information?


1230
00:54:39.526 --> 00:54:42.461
Sorry, I think I got
some media following me.


1231
00:54:42.596 --> 00:54:45.562
No. Those are our guys, bud.
Those are our guys.

00:55:23.263 --> 00:55:26.164
everything pretty normal
about that evening, right?


1245
00:55:26.299 --> 00:55:29.307
No, it was a regular night
from what I could tell.


1246
00:55:29.443 --> 00:55:31.306
Everyone was having
a great time.


1247
00:55:31.442 --> 00:55:33.736
It was like a celebration.

1248
00:55:33.872 --> 00:55:35.046
[Tom] Yeah. No air of...

1249
00:55:35.182 --> 00:55:36.876
Yeah, you were having fun.

1250
00:55:37.012 --> 00:55:38.611
I was having fun.
It was a good time.


1251
00:55:38.746 --> 00:55:41.352
But there was, uh, some guys

1252
00:55:41.487 --> 00:55:42.967
with beer cans
or something like that?


1253
00:55:43.046 --> 00:55:44.589
Guys behind the tower.

1254
00:55:44.725 --> 00:55:46.194
What were they doing there?
They were throwing...


1255
00:55:46.218 --> 00:55:48.084
- Beer bottles.
- Beer bottles. Yeah.


1256
00:55:48.220 --> 00:55:50.858
They were horsing around,
fooling.


1257
00:55:50.993 --> 00:55:54.031
I broke it up
and I gave 'em a talking-to,


1258
00:55:54.167 --> 00:55:55.333
and they left. Yep.

1259
00:55:55.469 --> 00:55:57.002
[Dan] And that was
behind the tower?


1260
00:55:57.137 --> 00:55:58.403
- Yes, sir.
- Right.


1261
00:55:58.539 --> 00:56:00.032
So then you came back
around the tower


1262
00:56:00.168 --> 00:56:02.735
and that's where you saw
the package unattended?


1263
00:56:02.870 --> 00:56:04.533
- Yes, sir.
- [Tom] Right.


1264
00:56:04.669 --> 00:56:08.546
[Dan] And did you see anyone
walking away from the bench?


1265
00:56:08.681 --> 00:56:10.980
No, sir. I would've
tailed them if I did.


1266
00:56:11.115 --> 00:56:13.411
Yeah.

1267
00:56:13.546 --> 00:56:15.951
So, you have no idea who might
have put that package there?


1268
00:56:16.087 --> 00:56:17.389
No, sir.

1269
00:56:17.525 --> 00:56:21.052
But whoever did,
I think they ought to fry.


1270
00:56:21.187 --> 00:56:23.521
Oh. Yeah. We think so,
too, Richard.


1271
00:56:23.656 --> 00:56:24.925
Absolutely.

1272
00:56:26.432 --> 00:56:28.862
So, here's what we're gonna do.

1273
00:56:28.998 --> 00:56:30.678
We're trying to be
as authentic as possible


1274
00:56:30.728 --> 00:56:34.703
and part of that has to do
with how you treat a suspect.


1275
00:56:34.838 --> 00:56:35.976
All right? So,
what we're gonna do is


1276
00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:37.399
we're gonna pretend

1277
00:56:37.535 --> 00:56:39.385
that we actually brought
you in, in that regard.


1278
00:56:39.409 --> 00:56:40.642
- Right?
- That...


1279
00:56:40.778 --> 00:56:42.018
And we read you
your Miranda rights


1280
00:56:42.042 --> 00:56:43.284
and you've agreed to waive them.

1281
00:56:43.308 --> 00:56:44.393
In fact, we have
a form you can sign.


1282
00:56:44.417 --> 00:56:45.609
[Dan] Yeah. Why don't you...?

1283
00:56:45.744 --> 00:56:46.942
This'll be good.

1284
00:56:47.077 --> 00:56:48.420
Just so it looks real.

1285
00:56:48.555 --> 00:56:50.517
Yeah. So, you just sign
the bottom there


1286
00:56:50.653 --> 00:56:52.822
and we'll get that on tape

1287
00:56:52.957 --> 00:56:55.989
and then we'll continue on
with the interview.


1288
00:56:58.228 --> 00:56:59.498
Okay.

1289
00:57:00.230 --> 00:57:01.500
Yeah.

1290
00:57:06.904 --> 00:57:08.443
I'm sorry, Richard,
maybe I wasn't clear.


1291
00:57:08.467 --> 00:57:10.839
You actually have to
physically sign the paper.


1292
00:57:13.239 --> 00:57:17.045
- This is a real document.
- [Dan] Well...


1293
00:57:17.181 --> 00:57:20.516
Of course. We're going for
authenticity here, Richard.


1294
00:57:20.652 --> 00:57:23.555
It has to be real for the video.

1295
00:57:25.622 --> 00:57:28.019
I'm sorry, sir. I don't

1296
00:57:28.155 --> 00:57:30.294
I don't think
I would feel comfortable


1297
00:57:30.429 --> 00:57:32.822
signing something like this.

1298
00:57:32.958 --> 00:57:34.457
Richard, we just want...

1299
00:57:34.592 --> 00:57:36.930
You know what? Why don't we
take a quick break?


1300
00:57:37.065 --> 00:57:39.332
- Go ahead and stop the camera.
- Okay.


1301
00:57:39.467 --> 00:57:41.133
Um...

1302
00:57:41.268 --> 00:57:43.234
- Yeah. Okay.
- We'll just talk for a second.


1303
00:57:43.369 --> 00:57:45.368
- We'll be right back.
- [Dan] Right back.


1304
00:57:53.044 --> 00:57:55.048
I was a sheriff deputy.

1305
00:57:55.815 --> 00:57:57.017
Habersham County.

1306
00:58:00.359 --> 00:58:01.958
All right, Richard,

1307
00:58:02.093 --> 00:58:03.903
we're gonna pretend like
none of that ever happened.


1308
00:58:03.927 --> 00:58:06.395
Let's get a new tape going.
Okay?


1309
00:58:06.531 --> 00:58:07.561
- Uh...
- [tape whirring]


1310
00:58:07.697 --> 00:58:10.332
What we're gonna do now...

1311
00:58:10.468 --> 00:58:11.866
There you go. I got it.

1312
00:58:12.002 --> 00:58:13.864
Get her out there
and we'll throw it away.


1313
00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:15.838
What we're gonna do now is.

1314
00:58:15.973 --> 00:58:17.653
Agent Bennet's gonna
come back in the room,


1315
00:58:17.742 --> 00:58:19.504
he's gonna reintroduce himself,

1316
00:58:19.640 --> 00:58:21.620
show you his credentials just
like a professional interview


1317
00:58:21.644 --> 00:58:22.844
and then we're gonna

1318
00:58:22.980 --> 00:58:24.018
actually read you
your Miranda rights.


1319
00:58:24.042 --> 00:58:25.408
Why would he do that?

1320
00:58:25.543 --> 00:58:27.027
[Tom] Well, to make it
more authentic, Richard.


1321
00:58:27.051 --> 00:58:29.011
We want this to look
as authentic as possible.


1322
00:58:29.147 --> 00:58:31.150
Come on in, Agent Bennet.

1323
00:58:32.687 --> 00:58:34.759
Mr. Jewell...

1324
00:58:34.895 --> 00:58:37.660
Special Agent Dan Bennet, FBI.
You have the right to


1325
00:58:37.796 --> 00:58:39.488
I'm sorry. I think... I'm sorry.

1326
00:58:39.623 --> 00:58:43.057
I think maybe I should
contact my attorney.


1327
00:58:43.193 --> 00:58:44.701
[Richard clears throat]

1328
00:58:44.837 --> 00:58:46.477
Now, why would you
wanna do that, Richard?


1329
00:58:46.502 --> 00:58:48.106
I mean...

1330
00:58:48.242 --> 00:58:49.607
You're the hero, right?

1331
00:58:49.743 --> 00:58:51.352
Unless there's something
you wanna tell us.


1332
00:58:51.376 --> 00:58:53.370
No. But I just

1333
00:58:56.250 --> 00:58:58.617
think I better call him.

1334
00:58:59.844 --> 00:59:01.345
Okay.

1335
00:59:05.390 --> 00:59:06.453
[sighs deeply]

1336
00:59:06.588 --> 00:59:07.857
Here you go.

1337
00:59:08.854 --> 00:59:10.123
Press nine.

1338
00:59:18.201 --> 00:59:22.267
Yes, hello, I'm calling
Information to get a hold...


1339
00:59:22.402 --> 00:59:25.941
The name is Watson Bryant.
He's a lawyer.


1340
00:59:27.471 --> 00:59:30.110
Thank you. Yeah, connect me.

1341
00:59:34.578 --> 00:59:36.544
I'm getting his message machine.

1342
00:59:36.680 --> 00:59:38.317
So, I'm gonna leave
a message for him.


1343
00:59:38.452 --> 00:59:40.372
[Tom] Go ahead. Leave a message
and that'll be...


1344
00:59:42.386 --> 00:59:45.355
This... [sighs] This is Watson.

1345
00:59:45.490 --> 00:59:47.695
Watson Bryant,
this is Richard Jewell


1346
00:59:47.831 --> 00:59:51.128
<i>calling in regards to, um,</i>

1347
00:59:51.263 --> 00:59:53.265
<i>something somewhat serious.</i>

1348
00:59:53.400 --> 00:59:54.772
<i>I would like you
to call me back.</i>


1349
00:59:54.907 --> 00:59:57.834
<i>I'm at the FBI office
in Atlanta.</i>


1350
00:59:57.969 --> 01:00:00.437
<i>If you could call me back
at your earliest convenience.</i>


1351
01:00:00.572 --> 01:00:02.747
<i>- Thank you. Bye.</i>
- [line disconnects]


1352
01:00:03.578 --> 01:00:04.980
[groans]

1353
01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:11.820
You can't leave your phone off.

1354
01:00:11.956 --> 01:00:13.196
I have to be able to reach you.

1355
01:00:13.260 --> 01:00:14.291
What's wrong?

1356
01:00:14.427 --> 01:00:17.024
You need more toner?

1357
01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:18.987
- He called three times.
- Who? Who called?


1358
01:00:19.123 --> 01:00:20.523
Who? Richard.

1359
01:00:20.659 --> 01:00:22.459
Three times from
the FBI interrogation room.


1360
01:00:22.595 --> 01:00:24.703
All right, all right,
all right, slow down.


1361
01:00:25.668 --> 01:00:27.068
Jesus Christ.

1362
01:00:29.106 --> 01:00:31.943
[grunts] Am I the only lawyer
this guy knows?


1363
01:00:32.079 --> 01:00:33.140
Yes.

1364
01:00:36.173 --> 01:00:38.343
The paper says...

1365
01:00:38.478 --> 01:00:40.686
Paper says the Bureau has him
dead to rights.


1366
01:00:41.684 --> 01:00:42.984
Where I come from,

1367
01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:44.492
when the government says
someone's guilty,


1368
01:00:44.516 --> 01:00:46.653
it's how you know
they're innocent.


1369
01:00:46.789 --> 01:00:48.923
It's different here?

1370
01:00:49.059 --> 01:00:50.927
I don't know. Looks pretty bad.

1371
01:00:52.189 --> 01:00:54.592
I don't care.

1372
01:00:54.728 --> 01:00:58.867
We'll get three or four cases
as juicy as this tomorrow,


1373
01:00:59.003 --> 01:01:00.363
and you have so much else to do.

1374
01:01:00.499 --> 01:01:01.907
All right, all right, all right.

1375
01:01:02.042 --> 01:01:04.042
Connect me with the field
office, would you, Nadya?


1376
01:01:05.344 --> 01:01:06.903
Right away.

1377
01:01:07.038 --> 01:01:08.070
Thank you.

1378
01:01:08.206 --> 01:01:10.012
Unless you're too busy.

1379
01:01:11.651 --> 01:01:12.694
Don't you have any work to do?

1380
01:01:12.718 --> 01:01:14.678
I have nothing else to do, no.

1381
01:01:14.814 --> 01:01:17.217
Yes, this is Watson Bryant,
attorney for Richard Jewell.


1382
01:01:17.352 --> 01:01:19.557
I'd like to speak
to my client, please.


1383
01:01:19.692 --> 01:01:21.056
[FBI operator]<i>I'm sorry, sir,</i>

1384
01:01:21.191 --> 01:01:22.631
<i>but we have no one here
by that name.</i>


1385
01:01:23.056 --> 01:01:25.522
Yeah, you do, actually.

1386
01:01:25.657 --> 01:01:27.458
Put me on the phone
with my client now.


1387
01:01:28.558 --> 01:01:29.866
<i>Please call back later, sir.</i>

1388
01:01:30.002 --> 01:01:31.467
<i>Maybe we'll have
more information.</i>


1389
01:01:31.602 --> 01:01:32.804
[line disconnects]

1390
01:01:40.538 --> 01:01:42.539
Dial that number again,
would you?


1391
01:01:50.681 --> 01:01:52.001
Yeah, this is
Watson Bryant again,


1392
01:01:52.053 --> 01:01:53.652
attorney for Richard Jewell.

1393
01:01:53.787 --> 01:01:55.907
My next call is gonna be to
Mike Wallace of<i>60 Minutes</i>


1394
01:01:56.028 --> 01:01:58.587
to ask him why the FBI
would deny a citizen


1395
01:01:58.723 --> 01:02:00.656
his constitutional right
to legal counsel.


1396
01:02:00.791 --> 01:02:03.230
Can I have the spelling
of your name, please?


1397
01:02:04.768 --> 01:02:06.398
Got a call for you.

1398
01:02:10.333 --> 01:02:12.033
[Richard]<i>Hello?</i>

1399
01:02:12.168 --> 01:02:14.449
Richard, [sighs] it's Watson.
What are you doing in there?


1400
01:02:14.508 --> 01:02:17.273
They said they needed me
for a training film.


1401
01:02:17.409 --> 01:02:18.559
No, they don't need you for...

1402
01:02:18.583 --> 01:02:19.913
You're a suspect.

1403
01:02:20.049 --> 01:02:21.442
Have you read the newspapers?

1404
01:02:21.578 --> 01:02:23.018
<i>Have you signed anything?</i>

1405
01:02:23.154 --> 01:02:24.579
<i>Have you confessed to anything?</i>

1406
01:02:24.715 --> 01:02:28.190
No, of course not.
I didn't do this.


1407
01:02:28.325 --> 01:02:31.256
All right, listen to me.
Listen to me real carefully.


1408
01:02:31.391 --> 01:02:34.123
Just don't say anything
to anyone.


1409
01:02:34.258 --> 01:02:36.226
You understand me?

1410
01:02:36.362 --> 01:02:37.660
<i>Get your ass outta there.</i>

01:09:02.516 --> 01:09:04.647
[sighs] Of course you are.

1566
01:09:04.782 --> 01:09:06.120
- Listen...
- Get out.


1567
01:09:06.256 --> 01:09:07.296
Have you secured an actual

1568
01:09:07.357 --> 01:09:08.631
defense attorney
for Richard yet?


1569
01:09:08.655 --> 01:09:10.189
- No comment.
- [groans]


1570
01:09:10.325 --> 01:09:11.458
Get out of the car.

1571
01:09:11.593 --> 01:09:12.635
See, "no comment"
doesn't help me,


1572
01:09:12.659 --> 01:09:14.122
which means I can't help you.

1573
01:09:16.469 --> 01:09:19.202
Is that what you wanna do?
You wanna help me?


1574
01:09:19.337 --> 01:09:20.799
Watson, I don't
get the sense you


1575
01:09:20.934 --> 01:09:22.417
grasp the tank that's
about to roll over you.


1576
01:09:22.441 --> 01:09:23.976
We're talking about
the U.S. government here


1577
01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:25.566
investigating a terrorism act.

1578
01:09:25.701 --> 01:09:27.302
You need me.

1579
01:09:27.438 --> 01:09:29.670
Okay, listen, crazy lady,
you want me to call the cops?


1580
01:09:29.806 --> 01:09:31.206
[laughs] Oh, please do.

1581
01:09:31.341 --> 01:09:33.181
The cops love me.
I tell their stories all day.


1582
01:09:33.314 --> 01:09:34.580
Let me tell yours.

1583
01:09:34.716 --> 01:09:36.354
- [scoffing]
- I'm just gonna ask


1584
01:09:36.489 --> 01:09:38.128
a couple questions that'll
help you tell your story.


1585
01:09:38.152 --> 01:09:39.467
- And you need me to help...
- Get out. Get out of my...


1586
01:09:39.491 --> 01:09:40.834
- You got some balls, man.
- Yes, I do.


1587
01:09:40.858 --> 01:09:42.116
Get out.

1588
01:09:42.252 --> 01:09:43.700
Come on. I'll just ask you
a few questions.


1589
01:09:43.724 --> 01:09:45.226
- Get out.
- We can go together.


1590
01:09:45.362 --> 01:09:46.522
Come on. I'll get my notepad.

1591
01:09:46.595 --> 01:09:48.029
Get the fuck out of my car now!

1592
01:09:48.164 --> 01:09:49.801
Get out of my car!

1593
01:09:49.936 --> 01:09:51.396
I'm sick of this shit.

1594
01:09:51.532 --> 01:09:53.128
You know where to find me.

1595
01:10:05.012 --> 01:10:07.311
- Yeah. Don't worry.
- Never been on TV before.


1596
01:10:07.446 --> 01:10:08.878
You'll be fine.

1597
01:10:09.014 --> 01:10:10.550
Mr. Jewell's attorney,
Mr. Bryant.


1598
01:10:10.686 --> 01:10:11.960
- Thanks for coming in.
- You're welcome.


1599
01:10:11.984 --> 01:10:13.384
What are the authorities
telling you


1600
01:10:13.426 --> 01:10:14.968
about their suspicions
about your client?


1601
01:10:14.992 --> 01:10:15.992
Uh, nothing.

1602
01:10:16.062 --> 01:10:17.260
No communication whatsoever?

1603
01:10:17.396 --> 01:10:19.526
Uh, all they've said
to me is that


1604
01:10:19.662 --> 01:10:20.942
they're not going to arrest him.

1605
01:10:21.059 --> 01:10:22.419
That's what
they told me yesterday.


1606
01:10:22.528 --> 01:10:23.798
You believe that?

1607
01:10:23.934 --> 01:10:25.125
No.

1608
01:10:25.261 --> 01:10:26.576
You think they are going
to arrest him?


1609
01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:27.966
I don't think they'd tell me

1610
01:10:28.101 --> 01:10:29.747
whether they were
or they weren't. That's all.


1611
01:10:29.771 --> 01:10:31.099
What do you think of the manner

1612
01:10:31.234 --> 01:10:32.940
in which the FBI
has treated your client


1613
01:10:33.075 --> 01:10:35.357
- pursuing this investigation?
- I think whoever the bum was


1614
01:10:35.381 --> 01:10:36.621
that leaked that Richard Jewell

1615
01:10:36.745 --> 01:10:38.279
was the focus
of this investigation,


1616
01:10:38.414 --> 01:10:40.250
he deserves to be prosecuted

1617
01:10:40.386 --> 01:10:41.706
or dealt with
in some serious way.


1618
01:10:41.816 --> 01:10:44.179
I don't think
that this investigation


1619
01:10:44.314 --> 01:10:47.748
should be conducted
under world spotlight,


1620
01:10:47.884 --> 01:10:49.283
if you will, like this.

1621
01:10:49.419 --> 01:10:51.193
What's your client told you
about this cabin


1622
01:10:51.328 --> 01:10:52.793
that's being searched today?

1623
01:10:52.928 --> 01:10:54.242
It's his former residence,
as I understand it.


1624
01:10:54.266 --> 01:10:55.830
You need
to understand something.


1625
01:10:55.966 --> 01:10:59.697
I have barely had the time
to take a breath in this case


1626
01:10:59.832 --> 01:11:01.703
since it started
the other night.


1627
01:11:01.838 --> 01:11:06.844
We have been reacting
to the media, to the FBI,


1628
01:11:06.980 --> 01:11:08.708
and I have not sat down

1629
01:11:08.843 --> 01:11:11.142
and conducted
an in-depth interview


1630
01:11:11.278 --> 01:11:13.583
about all these things that
y'all are asking me about.


1631
01:11:13.718 --> 01:11:15.464
Then why are you so convinced
of his innocence?


1632
01:11:15.488 --> 01:11:17.182
Because I've known Richard
for a while.


1633
01:11:17.317 --> 01:11:18.859
I've looked him in the eye and
I've asked him the question.


1634
01:11:18.883 --> 01:11:20.114
But you've admitted to me,

1635
01:11:20.250 --> 01:11:21.601
you didn't even know
he had a cabin.


1636
01:11:21.625 --> 01:11:23.185
You didn't know
about this prior arrest.


1637
01:11:23.221 --> 01:11:24.903
You didn't know
about the prior misdemeanors.


1638
01:11:24.927 --> 01:11:26.805
There's a whole lot of priors
you didn't know about.


1639
01:11:26.829 --> 01:11:29.127
I have not conducted
a thorough investigation


1640
01:11:29.262 --> 01:11:31.431
- into Richard's history.
- No, I understand all that.


1641
01:11:31.567 --> 01:11:32.767
I guess what I'm asking you is

1642
01:11:32.900 --> 01:11:34.429
considering that
you haven't done that,


1643
01:11:34.565 --> 01:11:36.045
and considering there are
things that you didn't know,


1644
01:11:36.069 --> 01:11:37.415
why are you so convinced
of his innocence?


1645
01:11:37.439 --> 01:11:38.439
Because I believe him.

1646
01:11:38.571 --> 01:11:39.602
Plain and simple?

1647
01:11:39.738 --> 01:11:41.476
Yeah. That's right.

1648
01:11:41.612 --> 01:11:43.040
I don't know
a whole lot of things


1649
01:11:43.175 --> 01:11:44.880
about a whole lot of people
that I know.


1650
01:11:45.015 --> 01:11:48.312
I don't have Richard's police
records. You may. I don't


1651
01:11:48.447 --> 01:11:52.588
I have not gotten up to speed
on some things. That's all.


1652
01:11:52.723 --> 01:11:54.852
But just because
I don't know these things


1653
01:11:54.988 --> 01:11:57.020
doesn't mean
that I don't have a feel


1654
01:11:57.156 --> 01:12:00.256
for where I think
Richard is in this case.


1655
01:12:00.392 --> 01:12:02.336
Were you aware that the
Habersham Sheriff's Department


1656
01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:04.892
had asked him to seek
psychological counseling?


1657
01:12:05.028 --> 01:12:06.564
I don't know that either.

1658
01:12:06.700 --> 01:12:07.933
But I know a lot of people

1659
01:12:08.069 --> 01:12:09.749
who ought to have
psychological counseling.


1660
01:12:09.871 --> 01:12:12.041
Watson Bryant,
I thank you very much.


1661
01:12:12.176 --> 01:12:13.544
See ya. Thank you.

1662
01:12:13.679 --> 01:12:17.139
Twenty-two past the hour.
We'll be right back.

From the pay phone
that was right here.


1707
01:13:51.942 --> 01:13:53.702
We also know that Richard
was inside the park

near the sound
and light tower at 12

1710

When Bill Miller
called the backpack in.


1711
01:13:59.113 --> 01:14:01.013
He would've had
to cover the distance in...


1712
01:14:01.148 --> 01:14:04.552
One minute.
So he couldn't have done it.


1713
01:14:04.688 --> 01:14:06.782
Could've ridden a bike, I guess.

There and back? No.

1715
01:14:10.461 --> 01:14:12.123
He really didn't do this.

1716
01:14:15.132 --> 01:14:16.132
No.

01:14:24.937 --> 01:14:26.467
We're gonna help this guy.

1719
01:14:28.838 --> 01:14:32.341
We're gonna help this guy.
This kid's getting railroaded.


1720
01:14:35.111 --> 01:14:36.521
[low indistinct chatter]

1721
01:14:37.814 --> 01:14:38.820
Holy...

1722
01:14:40.116 --> 01:14:42.657
You don't talk. I talk.

1723
01:14:42.792 --> 01:14:44.485
They're just gonna look around.

1724
01:14:45.761 --> 01:14:47.059
You got any guns in the house?

1725
01:14:49.499 --> 01:14:51.930
Yeah, we're in Georgia.

1726
01:14:52.066 --> 01:14:54.670
Yeah, of course you do.
Go get 'em.


1727
01:14:54.806 --> 01:14:56.286
Lay 'em on your bed
so we can see 'em.


1728
01:14:56.375 --> 01:14:57.608
We don't want any surprises.

1729
01:14:59.678 --> 01:15:01.703
How many of 'em
are coming in here?


1730
01:15:01.838 --> 01:15:02.910
Uh...

1731
01:15:04.579 --> 01:15:05.781
There's a couple.

1732
01:15:07.512 --> 01:15:09.620
Can they leave their shoes
outside the door?


1733
01:15:10.884 --> 01:15:12.412
Well, I could ask 'em, Bobi.

1734
01:15:12.548 --> 01:15:13.919
I don't know
if they would oblige.


1735
01:15:14.055 --> 01:15:17.056
- [gun cocks]
- [Bobi] Oh, God. [Sighs]


1736
01:15:21.300 --> 01:15:22.666
[Watson] Oh, good Lord.

1737
01:15:23.861 --> 01:15:26.494
Uh... [laughing]

1738
01:15:29.666 --> 01:15:32.267
Were you expecting a zombie
invasion or something?


1739
01:15:32.402 --> 01:15:34.244
No, I wasn't expecting zombies.

1740
01:15:34.379 --> 01:15:36.674
I expect deer. I hunt.

1741
01:15:36.810 --> 01:15:38.946
[Watson] You hunt? Okay.

1742
01:15:39.081 --> 01:15:40.601
Radar, let me explain
something to you.


1743
01:15:40.684 --> 01:15:42.611
All you're guilty of right now

1744
01:15:42.747 --> 01:15:45.453
is looking like the kinda guy
who might set off a bomb.


1745
01:15:45.588 --> 01:15:46.788
But everything you do

1746
01:15:46.924 --> 01:15:50.393
that promotes that image
is gonna hang us.


1747
01:15:50.528 --> 01:15:52.795
Sorry. Poor choice of words.

1748
01:15:53.761 --> 01:15:55.126
Those jackals out there,

1749
01:15:55.262 --> 01:15:58.129
they want your ass
on a chopping block.


1750
01:15:58.264 --> 01:16:00.836
Is there anything else
odd or quirky


1751
01:16:00.971 --> 01:16:04.274
or fucking weird
that I'm gonna discover today?


1752
01:16:04.409 --> 01:16:06.468
[exhales] Yeah, kinda.

1753
01:16:07.740 --> 01:16:09.307
I haven't

1754
01:16:09.442 --> 01:16:13.913
I haven't paid my taxes
in about... A couple years.


1755
01:16:14.049 --> 01:16:16.587
- Oh.
- This gets better and better.


1756
01:16:16.723 --> 01:16:21.284
[sighs] Guns, guns, guns.
I hate guns.


1757
01:16:21.420 --> 01:16:23.221
Every time Richard
goes huntin', I say,


1758
01:16:23.356 --> 01:16:26.054
"Don't you dare drag
a dead Bambi in here."


1759
01:16:26.190 --> 01:16:27.962
"I don't wanna eat Bambi."

1760
01:16:29.026 --> 01:16:30.125
But you know what?

1761
01:16:30.260 --> 01:16:32.261
Richard, when he was deputy

1762
01:16:32.397 --> 01:16:34.133
with the Habersham
County Sheriff's,


1763
01:16:34.268 --> 01:16:37.899
he got 98 out of 100
on his shootin' test.


1764
01:16:38.034 --> 01:16:39.270
It was awesome.

1765
01:16:39.903 --> 01:16:40.909
Mmm-hmm.

1766
01:16:42.141 --> 01:16:44.445
[clicks tongue] That's great.

1767
01:16:44.580 --> 01:16:45.744
[banging on door]

1768
01:16:45.880 --> 01:16:47.176
- Okay.
- Dear God.


1769
01:16:47.311 --> 01:16:49.614
You don't talk. I talk. Say it.

1770
01:16:49.750 --> 01:16:52.182
I don't talk.

1771
01:16:52.318 --> 01:16:54.790
But I want those guys
to know that


1772
01:16:54.926 --> 01:16:57.326
I'm law enforcement, too.
Just like them.


1773
01:16:57.461 --> 01:17:00.130
See, right there?

1774
01:17:00.265 --> 01:17:01.389
That's talking.

1775
01:17:01.525 --> 01:17:03.294
That's what we don't want, okay?

1776
01:17:08.301 --> 01:17:10.367
You picked the right lawyer,
Richard.


1777
01:17:14.506 --> 01:17:16.505
- [loud knocking on door]
- [Watson] Ugh. [Sighs]


1778
01:17:18.712 --> 01:17:20.179
We all set?

1779
01:17:20.314 --> 01:17:22.194
- [Watson] Yeah.
- All right, let's go. Come on.


1780
01:17:22.685 --> 01:17:24.481
Let's start in the back.

1781
01:17:24.616 --> 01:17:26.552
Bring it in. Let's go.
By the numbers, everybody.


1782
01:17:26.687 --> 01:17:27.716
By the numbers.

1783
01:17:27.852 --> 01:17:29.049
Hold on.

1784
01:17:29.184 --> 01:17:31.124
Oh... Okay.

1785
01:17:34.463 --> 01:17:35.965
Okay.

1786
01:17:36.100 --> 01:17:38.327
Yeah, so, you guys go ahead
and take everything.


1787
01:17:38.462 --> 01:17:39.967
Take the carpet,
whatever you need.


1788
01:17:40.103 --> 01:17:41.583
I'm law enforcement, too,
so I get it.


1789
01:17:41.707 --> 01:17:43.533
Just know
that whatever you take,


1790
01:17:43.668 --> 01:17:46.740
it's just gonna prove
that I didn't do anything.


1791
01:17:46.876 --> 01:17:48.808
Yeah, we've done this before.

1792
01:17:48.944 --> 01:17:51.073
You'll be counsel, Mr. Bryant?

1793
01:17:51.208 --> 01:17:53.376
That's the plan, yeah.

1794
01:17:53.512 --> 01:17:54.829
All right, well,
if you're gonna stay here,


1795
01:17:54.853 --> 01:17:56.173
you're gonna have to
put these on.


1796
01:17:56.217 --> 01:17:57.529
Yeah, let's go.
Gloves and booties.


1797
01:17:57.553 --> 01:17:58.755
[Dan] Yeah.

1798
01:17:58.891 --> 01:18:00.516
You heard the man.
Booties and gloves.


1799
01:18:09.402 --> 01:18:10.801
[indistinct chatter]

1800
01:18:27.382 --> 01:18:30.446
[whispering] Watson, they're
emptying my Tupperware.


1801
01:18:30.581 --> 01:18:32.289
All right, let's play ball
right now.


1802
01:18:32.424 --> 01:18:33.756
We'll get it back.

1803
01:18:33.892 --> 01:18:36.251
If y'all need help
finding anything,


1804
01:18:36.386 --> 01:18:37.623
feel free to ask one of us.

1805
01:18:37.758 --> 01:18:39.027
We can help.

1806
01:18:41.767 --> 01:18:43.064
[whispers] Just trying to help.

1807
01:18:44.602 --> 01:18:45.726
[agent] It's in there.

1808
01:18:53.941 --> 01:18:55.637
You ever read that book?

1809
01:18:57.113 --> 01:19:00.312
Got a lot in it
about police procedure.


1810
01:19:00.447 --> 01:19:03.018
It's a good one.
It's kinda controversial.


1811
01:19:07.789 --> 01:19:08.991
It's a good book.

1812
01:19:12.464 --> 01:19:13.864
It's a good book.

1813
01:19:15.125 --> 01:19:16.191
Oh, uh

1814
01:19:16.327 --> 01:19:17.659
I can help you with that.

1815
01:19:19.164 --> 01:19:20.871
I babysit with those.

1816
01:19:23.274 --> 01:19:25.146
You know what? Actually,
it might be easier if you guys


1817
01:19:25.170 --> 01:19:26.435
just waited outside

1818
01:19:26.571 --> 01:19:27.889
- while we did our jobs.
- Good idea.


1819
01:19:27.913 --> 01:19:29.186
- Yeah, let's do that.
- Thank you.


1820
01:19:29.210 --> 01:19:30.418
[Watson] Let's do that, Richard.

1821
01:19:30.442 --> 01:19:31.006
Let's get the hell out of here.

1822
01:19:31.141 --> 01:19:32.175
[Tom] Thank you.

1823
01:19:32.310 --> 01:19:33.774
Johnson, Rosario, anything?

1824
01:19:37.820 --> 01:19:39.252
[indistinct chatter]

1825
01:19:41.956 --> 01:19:44.087
What was the agreement?

1826
01:19:44.223 --> 01:19:46.622
That I wouldn't talk. Yup.

1827
01:19:47.731 --> 01:19:49.090
Yeah, what'd you do?

1828
01:19:49.225 --> 01:19:50.868
I talked.

1829
01:19:55.068 --> 01:19:56.434
They wanna fry you.

1830
01:19:56.569 --> 01:19:57.776
You understand that?
You know that, right?


1831
01:19:57.800 --> 01:20:00.007
Everyone here wants to fry you.

1832
01:20:00.143 --> 01:20:01.538
You're a little piece of bacon.

1833
01:20:04.113 --> 01:20:06.312
[Richard] Well,
on a lighter note,


1834
01:20:06.447 --> 01:20:09.178
you never did tell me
the name of the firm


1835
01:20:09.314 --> 01:20:11.178
you moved to and whatnot.

1836
01:20:11.313 --> 01:20:13.086
I opened my own.

1837
01:20:13.222 --> 01:20:14.754
What made you do
something like that?


1838
01:20:14.890 --> 01:20:16.356
Firms mean partners,

1839
01:20:16.491 --> 01:20:18.687
and partners think
they can tell you who to be.


1840
01:20:18.822 --> 01:20:20.564
I don't care much
for being dictated to.


1841
01:20:20.700 --> 01:20:22.590
[Bobi] Hey! You have no right.

1842
01:20:22.726 --> 01:20:24.328
- Come back here.
- Mama, what's wrong?


1843
01:20:24.463 --> 01:20:26.694
They went through
my underthings.


1844
01:20:26.830 --> 01:20:28.571
How much indignity
do they want us to take?


1845
01:20:28.707 --> 01:20:29.773
[Watson] All right, Bobi.

1846
01:20:29.909 --> 01:20:31.876
Hey, hold on, fellas. Excuse me.

1847
01:20:33.308 --> 01:20:34.780
- Mama, hey...
- [reporters clamoring]


1848
01:20:34.804 --> 01:20:36.907
[Watson] Bobi.
Excuse me, fellas.


1849
01:20:37.042 --> 01:20:38.411
Bobi. Excuse me.

1850
01:20:38.546 --> 01:20:39.618
[female reporter]
What did they take from you?


1851
01:20:39.642 --> 01:20:41.016
[Watson] Hold on now. Hold on.

1852
01:20:41.151 --> 01:20:43.510
Bobi, let me take care
of it for you.


1853
01:20:43.646 --> 01:20:45.214
Can I take care of it for you?

1854
01:20:45.349 --> 01:20:46.416
I'm gonna go get 'em.

1855
01:20:46.552 --> 01:20:48.058
I'm gonna go get 'em. Excuse me.

1856
01:20:48.193 --> 01:20:49.953
[female reporter]
What can you share with us?


1857
01:20:50.055 --> 01:20:51.489
They found

1858
01:20:51.625 --> 01:20:53.357
some really dangerous
pantyhose, apparently.


1859
01:20:53.492 --> 01:20:55.163
- [male reporter] Seriously?
- Yeah.


1860
01:20:55.963 --> 01:20:57.264
[Tom] Richard.

1861
01:20:57.399 --> 01:20:59.266
Come here for a sec.
I wanna talk to you.


1862
01:21:01.070 --> 01:21:02.539
- Come on inside.
- Yes, sir.


1863
01:21:02.674 --> 01:21:04.105
What can I help with?

1864
01:21:04.241 --> 01:21:05.761
Just come on inside.
Just for a second.


1865
01:21:08.838 --> 01:21:10.020
What did they pull out
of the house?


1866
01:21:10.044 --> 01:21:11.381
Did he do it, Watson?

1867
01:21:11.516 --> 01:21:12.907
No, he did not.

1868
01:21:13.042 --> 01:21:14.822
Richard Jewell is
an innocent man. He's a hero.


1869
01:21:14.846 --> 01:21:16.712
If he's innocent,
then why is the FBI here?


1870
01:21:18.686 --> 01:21:21.952
[sighs] We welcome the FBI.
We're glad they're here.


1871
01:21:22.088 --> 01:21:23.323
No, you don't.

1872
01:21:27.295 --> 01:21:28.896
You know that's not true, Kathy.

1873
01:21:29.032 --> 01:21:30.891
Can I see those boxes, please?

1874
01:21:32.730 --> 01:21:34.431
All right, here's what
we're gonna do.


1875
01:21:34.567 --> 01:21:35.847
I'm gonna hand you this phone...

1876
01:21:35.904 --> 01:21:36.904
[dialing on phone]

1877
01:21:37.004 --> 01:21:38.072
And when I do,

1878
01:21:38.208 --> 01:21:39.448
you're gonna wait till the beep

1879
01:21:39.539 --> 01:21:41.042
and then you're gonna
say into it,


1880
01:21:41.178 --> 01:21:43.074
"There's a bomb
in Centennial Park.


1881
01:21:43.209 --> 01:21:44.209
You have 30 minutes."

1882
01:21:44.340 --> 01:21:45.340
[stammers]

1883
01:21:45.407 --> 01:21:47.815
I'm sorry. Why?

1884
01:21:47.951 --> 01:21:49.479
We need a voice exemplar.

1885
01:21:49.614 --> 01:21:50.887
Like you to say it a few times.

1886
01:21:51.023 --> 01:21:51.819
"There's a bomb
in Centennial Park.


1887
01:21:51.954 --> 01:21:53.287
You have 30 minutes."

1888
01:21:53.422 --> 01:21:55.142
It might be the only way
to clear your name.


1889
01:21:56.057 --> 01:21:58.419
I do wanna help y'all.

1890
01:21:58.555 --> 01:22:00.160
I'm law enforcement, too.

1891
01:22:00.296 --> 01:22:01.830
Well, yeah.
Then you should know how


1892
01:22:01.965 --> 01:22:03.825
evidentiary this is, right?

1893
01:22:03.960 --> 01:22:05.409
So, "There's a bomb
in Centennial Park."


1894
01:22:05.433 --> 01:22:06.571
- "You have 30 minutes."
- [line ringing]


1895
01:22:06.595 --> 01:22:08.335
"30 minutes." Okay.

1896
01:22:09.268 --> 01:22:12.169
[breathing nervously]

1897
01:22:12.305 --> 01:22:14.008
- After the beep?
- Yeah.


1898
01:22:14.143 --> 01:22:15.373
- [Dan] Mmm-hmm.
- [line beeps]


1899
01:22:15.509 --> 01:22:18.108
There is a bomb
in Centennial Park.


1900
01:22:18.244 --> 01:22:19.610
You have 30 minutes.

1901
01:22:19.745 --> 01:22:21.385
Okay, one more time.
Just a little louder.


1902
01:22:23.913 --> 01:22:26.347
There is a bomb
in Centennial Park.


1903
01:22:26.483 --> 01:22:28.455
You have 30 minutes.

1904
01:22:28.590 --> 01:22:30.305
Okay, that's great.
Can you do it one more time?


1905
01:22:30.329 --> 01:22:32.392
Maybe let's do a series.
We'll do a couple in a row.


1906
01:22:34.524 --> 01:22:35.659
[Richard] All right.

1907
01:22:37.630 --> 01:22:39.998
There is a bomb
in Centennial Park.


1908
01:22:40.134 --> 01:22:41.597
You have 30 minutes.

1909
01:22:41.733 --> 01:22:44.002
There is a bomb
in Centennial Park.


1910
01:22:44.138 --> 01:22:45.370
You have 30 minutes.

1911
01:22:45.506 --> 01:22:47.874
There is a bomb
in Centennial Park.


1912
01:22:48.010 --> 01:22:49.803
You have 30 minutes.

1913
01:22:49.939 --> 01:22:52.175
There is a bomb
in Centennial Park.


1914
01:22:52.311 --> 01:22:53.543
You have 30 minutes.

1915
01:22:53.679 --> 01:22:56.012
There is a bomb
in Centennial Park.


1916
01:22:56.147 --> 01:22:58.428
Are you fucking kidding me?
No, no, you don't talk to him.


1917
01:22:58.454 --> 01:22:59.624
[Richard] It's standard
procedure, they said.


1918
01:22:59.648 --> 01:23:01.056
[Watson] No, hell it is.

1919
01:23:01.192 --> 01:23:02.517
- In Russia.
- Mr. Bryant, listen.


1920
01:23:02.653 --> 01:23:04.327
Your client volunteered this.

1921
01:23:04.463 --> 01:23:06.921
Oh, bullshit. Maybe you can
do this. Maybe you can't.


1922
01:23:07.057 --> 01:23:08.802
You're not doing it today.
Let's go, Richard.


1923
01:23:08.826 --> 01:23:10.186
- Let's go.
- [Richard] I told them


1924
01:23:10.235 --> 01:23:11.762
I'm doing it
if it helps clear my name.


1925
01:23:11.898 --> 01:23:14.561
- Let's go! Not today.
- Your client agreed to this.


1926
01:23:14.696 --> 01:23:16.073
I'm gonna sue your ass

1927
01:23:16.208 --> 01:23:17.382
- for intentional violation...
- [Tom] Okay.


1928
01:23:17.406 --> 01:23:18.443
Of his constitutional rights.

1929
01:23:18.467 --> 01:23:19.569
[Tom] Okay.

1930
01:23:19.704 --> 01:23:21.020
I'm having
all this shit excluded.


1931
01:23:21.044 --> 01:23:22.446
You guys are full of shit.

1932
01:23:22.581 --> 01:23:23.581
Let's go.

1933
01:23:25.980 --> 01:23:26.980
[Dan] We got it.

1934
01:23:33.925 --> 01:23:35.422
[camera shutters clicking]

1935
01:23:46.804 --> 01:23:48.105
Have a good night.

1936
01:23:48.240 --> 01:23:50.202
[Bobi] What do they want
with the vacuum cleaner?


1937
01:23:50.337 --> 01:23:52.439
All right. We're done here.

1938
01:23:57.583 --> 01:23:59.006
[groaning]

1939
01:24:00.486 --> 01:24:01.486
Richard?

1940
01:24:03.581 --> 01:24:06.248
I'm fine. Yeah, I'm fine.

1941
01:24:06.384 --> 01:24:07.384
What's wrong?

1942
01:24:07.518 --> 01:24:09.225
Let's get you inside.

1943
01:24:09.360 --> 01:24:11.094
Dave, can you get her
something to drink?


1944
01:24:11.230 --> 01:24:12.990
- Maybe some water?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure.


1945
01:24:18.527 --> 01:24:19.730
What's going on?

1946
01:24:20.936 --> 01:24:22.396
[exhales]

1947
01:24:22.532 --> 01:24:23.734
It's nothing.

1948
01:24:24.467 --> 01:24:25.505
I'm fine.

1949
01:24:44.226 --> 01:24:46.790
They took all my Tupperware.

1950
01:24:46.925 --> 01:24:49.826
What would they need
with my Tupperware?


1951
01:24:49.962 --> 01:24:53.570
The bomber used Tupperware
to hold the nails.


1952
01:24:53.705 --> 01:24:55.095
That's standard.

1953
01:24:57.474 --> 01:25:00.407
Well, what does that
have to do with you?


1954
01:25:00.542 --> 01:25:02.679
And they took
my babysittin' tapes.


1955
01:25:02.814 --> 01:25:04.337
My Disney movies.

1956
01:25:04.473 --> 01:25:07.316
Yeah, I think they did that
because they wanted to see


1957
01:25:07.451 --> 01:25:09.648
if we might've recorded
something on the tapes,


1958
01:25:09.783 --> 01:25:12.154
like a political statement
or something.


1959
01:25:12.290 --> 01:25:16.456
Why do you keep
defending these people?


1960
01:25:16.592 --> 01:25:18.721
I'm not defending.
I'm just explaining.


1961
01:25:18.857 --> 01:25:20.527
- Well, stop it!
- [knocking at door]


1962
01:25:28.436 --> 01:25:30.400
- Hey, there she is. Hey.
- Hi.


1963
01:25:30.536 --> 01:25:32.535
- How you doin'?
- Hello.


1964
01:25:32.670 --> 01:25:34.541
This is Nadya. She's, uh...

1965
01:25:35.474 --> 01:25:36.873
She tells me what to do.

1966
01:25:37.009 --> 01:25:38.854
Here. Let me take that.
That's very nice of you.


1967
01:25:38.878 --> 01:25:41.014
I thought you might
want some dinner.


1968
01:25:41.149 --> 01:25:43.284
Bless your heart.

1969
01:25:43.420 --> 01:25:44.848
- Thank you.
- [Nadya] Of course.


1970

Hi, I'm Richard.

1971
01:25:48.690 --> 01:25:50.352
What did I tell you
about talking, Rich?


1972
01:25:50.487 --> 01:25:51.888
[Nadya] Oh.

1973
01:25:52.023 --> 01:25:54.356
Oh, God, yeah.
I guess I can't talk anymore.

01:26:01.769 --> 01:26:04.208
Come on, Richard,
you can't hide anymore.


1977
01:26:08.104 --> 01:26:09.424
Richard, one question.
That's all.


1978
01:26:09.474 --> 01:26:10.478
Did you do it?

1979
01:26:19.048 --> 01:26:21.082
Richard, how many bombs
have you made?


1980
01:26:24.221 --> 01:26:27.121
What did the FBI take out
of your house, Richard?

Hand grenade?

01:27:28.426 --> 01:27:29.786
What do you got
a hand grenade for?


1987
01:27:29.819 --> 01:27:30.860
Yeah, it's hollowed out.

1988
01:27:30.996 --> 01:27:32.285
It's a paperweight.

1989
01:27:32.420 --> 01:27:34.493
I bought it from
a military surplus store.


1990
01:27:34.628 --> 01:27:36.328
- Yeah.
- But it's nothing.


1991
01:27:36.464 --> 01:27:38.302
Christ, of course you did.

1992

[Watson] From where
the bomb was?


1998
01:27:51.240 --> 01:27:53.348
[Richard] It's a souvenir.
A memento.


1999
01:27:53.484 --> 01:27:54.764
[Watson] What'd you do that for?

2000
01:27:54.815 --> 01:27:56.682
I think it was
a pretty memorable night


2001
01:27:56.817 --> 01:27:58.488
where I did something
pretty great.


2002
01:27:58.624 --> 01:28:02.121
So, I thought maybe
that was worth holding on to.


2003
01:28:02.256 --> 01:28:03.921
Wow. Okay.

2004
01:28:04.796 --> 01:28:05.956
Nice.

but if you were
to do this to me,


2013
01:28:38.121 --> 01:28:39.601
you'd have to fight me.
[laughing] Oh!

You'd have to beat
the shit outta me!

before my mama comes back?

you still proud
to be law enforcement?


2023

You know what? Maybe if I did
my job a little better,

01:29:06.291 --> 01:29:08.248
and got people far enough away,

2025

then I wouldn't be

01:29:15.961 --> 01:29:18.433
Have you dummies
done the math yet


2029
01:29:18.569 --> 01:29:20.326
on the call from the pay phone?

2030
01:29:20.462 --> 01:29:23.067
Hey, listen,
fuck the pay phone! Okay?


2031
01:29:23.202 --> 01:29:25.598
My clients were the people
in the park that night


2032
01:29:25.734 --> 01:29:29.303
that didn't deserve to get
their fuckin' heads blown off.


2033
01:29:29.438 --> 01:29:31.151
You know, I actually
feel sorry for you guys.


2034
01:29:31.175 --> 01:29:33.208
When the real bomber
does it again,


2035
01:29:33.343 --> 01:29:35.318
and the country asks,
"Where was the FBI?"


2036
01:29:35.454 --> 01:29:36.816
You're gonna say, "We were busy

2037
01:29:36.951 --> 01:29:38.366
getting hair samples
from Richard Jewell."


2038
01:29:38.390 --> 01:29:40.616
- I'm done here.
- All set? Great.


2039
01:29:40.751 --> 01:29:41.984
[Watson] Oh, good.

2040
01:29:42.119 --> 01:29:43.788
Well, Richard,
thank you very much


2041
01:29:43.924 --> 01:29:45.231
for your professional
consideration.


2042
01:29:45.255 --> 01:29:47.063
You know, [taps table]
cop to cop.


2043
01:29:47.199 --> 01:29:48.991
[Watson] "We're the FBI."

2044
01:29:49.127 --> 01:29:51.400
I got your cop to cop.
Right here.


2045
01:29:51.535 --> 01:29:52.935
- [Tom] Mmm-hmm.
- There's the door.


2046
01:29:53.062 --> 01:29:54.361
[Tom] Found it. Thank you.

2047
01:29:56.938 --> 01:29:59.641
Richard, we need
to be a little less, uh


2048
01:30:01.169 --> 01:30:02.937
solicitous and a little more

2049
01:30:03.073 --> 01:30:05.440
righteous with these assjacks.

2050
01:30:05.576 --> 01:30:09.244
I mean, it's just hairs.
They'll grow back. It's fine.


2051
01:30:10.417 --> 01:30:12.279
What'd you say?

2052
01:30:12.415 --> 01:30:14.282
They're just hairs.
They'll grow back.


2053
01:30:15.523 --> 01:30:16.523
They're just hair. Hey!

2054
01:30:18.390 --> 01:30:20.721
Why doesn't this shit make you
as angry as it makes me?


2055
01:30:20.856 --> 01:30:22.164
I am angry.

2056
01:30:22.300 --> 01:30:23.956
You could have fooled me.

2057
01:30:24.092 --> 01:30:25.693
[scoffing] You're angry?

2058
01:30:25.829 --> 01:30:28.433
'Course I am.

2059
01:30:28.569 --> 01:30:29.835
I don't know if "angry"

2060
01:30:29.971 --> 01:30:32.641
is even a big enough word
for how I feel.


2061
01:30:34.077 --> 01:30:35.212
Come on.

2062
01:30:35.347 --> 01:30:37.039
Then stop being such a doormat.

2063
01:30:37.175 --> 01:30:38.714
Stop trying to be
their best friend.


2064
01:30:38.850 --> 01:30:40.287
You know, they're making
fun of you out there. You know


2065
01:30:40.311 --> 01:30:41.894
- what they're calling you?
- I know that!


2066
01:30:41.918 --> 01:30:44.649
I know what it means
when he says "cop to cop."


2067
01:30:44.784 --> 01:30:46.456
He doesn't mean cop to cop.

2068
01:30:46.592 --> 01:30:47.763
He thinks
I'm the Pillsbury Doughboy.


2069
01:30:47.787 --> 01:30:49.052
Do ya? Could have fooled me.

2070
01:30:49.188 --> 01:30:51.484
I thought you guys
were gonna get engaged.


2071
01:30:51.620 --> 01:30:54.764
Hey! Richard!
You go for a cookie right now,


2072
01:30:54.900 --> 01:30:57.358
I'm gonna chop off your hands
and shove 'em up your ass!


2073
01:30:58.734 --> 01:31:00.531
Try eating a cookie then,
fucker.


2074
01:31:00.667 --> 01:31:02.331
[breathing heavily]

2075
01:31:02.466 --> 01:31:04.970
Why'd you wanna represent me
and be my lawyer?


2076
01:31:05.105 --> 01:31:07.271
Hey, you looked like
you needed some help.


2077
01:31:07.407 --> 01:31:11.438
You look like you might've
needed money from a book deal.


2078
01:31:11.573 --> 01:31:13.122
Well, let me ask you,
why'd you pick me?


2079
01:31:13.146 --> 01:31:14.261
There's a lot of lawyers
in the phone book.


2080
01:31:14.285 --> 01:31:15.651
What'd you pick me for?

2081
01:31:15.786 --> 01:31:17.258
I picked you because
you were the only one


2082
01:31:17.282 --> 01:31:18.985
at the U.S. Small Business
Admin bureau


2083
01:31:19.120 --> 01:31:21.448
who didn't treat me like
a 5-year-old, and call me


2084
01:31:21.583 --> 01:31:24.787
"bag of snacks" and "blimp,"
"Michelin Man,"


2085
01:31:24.923 --> 01:31:26.088
and "Pillsbury Doughboy."

2086
01:31:26.223 --> 01:31:27.888
You're the only one
who treated me


2087
01:31:28.024 --> 01:31:29.993
like a human being!

2088
01:31:30.128 --> 01:31:31.601
And now you're just
yelling at me,


2089
01:31:31.736 --> 01:31:34.536
telling me to be somebody
that I'm not!


2090
01:31:34.672 --> 01:31:36.403
I don't know how to be that guy!

2091
01:31:36.539 --> 01:31:38.542
You're that guy! I'm me!

2092
01:31:41.707 --> 01:31:43.437
[banging on door]

2093
01:31:48.151 --> 01:31:49.179
What?

2094
01:31:51.651 --> 01:31:52.682
[door closes]

2095
01:31:52.818 --> 01:31:54.284
[mouthing silently]

2096
01:31:54.419 --> 01:31:56.299
[softly] I don't know
what you're talking about.


2097
01:32:03.532 --> 01:32:05.663
[whispers] Oh, my Lord.

2098
01:32:05.798 --> 01:32:08.066
How can they do that?

2099
01:32:08.865 --> 01:32:10.998
It's easy,

2100
01:32:11.134 --> 01:32:12.675
because you don't matter.

2101
01:32:13.837 --> 01:32:15.106
That's how come.

2102
01:32:18.750 --> 01:32:21.178
[singer singing in slow motion
in distance]


2103
01:32:28.018 --> 01:32:31.661
[Richard] We need to go!

2104
01:32:32.690 --> 01:32:34.994
Move!

2105
01:32:36.795 --> 01:32:40.296
You guys gotta go!

2106
01:32:44.276 --> 01:32:48.271
We need to evacuate!

2107
01:32:50.810 --> 01:32:52.242
[singing continues]

2108
01:32:56.782 --> 01:32:58.182
[bomb ticking]

2109
01:33:07.363 --> 01:33:08.764
[ticking louder]

2110
01:33:15.637 --> 01:33:18.932
[ticking and whirring]

2111
01:33:19.067 --> 01:33:20.941
[yelling]

2112
01:33:22.147 --> 01:33:23.977
[gasping]

2113
01:33:27.283 --> 01:33:29.646
Oh. Oh.

2114
01:33:29.781 --> 01:33:31.281
[panting]

2115
01:33:36.458 --> 01:33:37.661
Oh. [Groans]

2116
01:33:38.660 --> 01:33:39.993
[indistinct TV chatter]

2117
01:33:46.271 --> 01:33:48.171
Mr. Dutchess.

2118
01:33:48.306 --> 01:33:49.306
You got a minute?

2119
01:33:50.604 --> 01:33:51.741
I got that.

2120
01:33:52.838 --> 01:33:54.038
There you go.

2121
01:33:54.174 --> 01:33:55.811
- Can I finish my food?
- Nope. Mmm.


2122
01:33:57.381 --> 01:33:58.715
Hmm, that's good.

2123
01:34:03.645 --> 01:34:05.282
[Dave] They've decided
that since


2124
01:34:05.418 --> 01:34:08.117
you can't have placed
the 911 call yourself,


2125
01:34:08.252 --> 01:34:10.620
that you must've had a partner.

2126
01:34:10.755 --> 01:34:15.323
They think your partner must
be your homosexual boyfriend,


2127
01:34:15.458 --> 01:34:17.393
which they decided
is probably me.


2128
01:34:18.797 --> 01:34:19.827
[Watson snorts]

2129
01:34:19.962 --> 01:34:21.166
What?

2130
01:34:22.200 --> 01:34:23.630
They asked me to wear a wire.

2131
01:34:24.770 --> 01:34:26.171
[Richard scoffs]

2132
01:34:26.307 --> 01:34:28.811
I told them to shove it.
I said you were a hero.


2133
01:34:28.947 --> 01:34:30.707
And they said,
"Well, if he really is a hero,


2134
01:34:30.782 --> 01:34:32.019
then he's got nothing
to worry about


2135
01:34:32.043 --> 01:34:34.379
and neither do you."

2136
01:34:34.514 --> 01:34:38.017
They also told me that, uh,
one of your GBI buddies,


2137
01:34:38.153 --> 01:34:39.633
you know,
the one you made lasagne for


2138
01:34:39.688 --> 01:34:40.688
when he came over...

2139
01:34:40.754 --> 01:34:41.754
Yeah, Miller.

2140
01:34:41.886 --> 01:34:43.125
Yeah. Yeah.

2141
01:34:43.260 --> 01:34:45.021
Yeah.

2142
01:34:45.156 --> 01:34:46.521
He was wearing a wire, too.

2143
01:34:47.663 --> 01:34:49.590
He's got a lot on you.

2144
01:34:51.500 --> 01:34:54.431
[Richard sighs]

2145
01:34:54.567 --> 01:34:57.400
[clears throat] There's, uh,
one other thing. Um...


2146
01:34:59.937 --> 01:35:03.646
They asked me if I'd ever had
any experience with pipe bombs


2147
01:35:03.782 --> 01:35:05.749
and I had to tell them
the truth.


2148
01:35:07.475 --> 01:35:09.414
You know, the little ones.

2149
01:35:09.550 --> 01:35:11.558
We used to drop them down
gopher holes when I was a kid


2150
01:35:11.582 --> 01:35:14.551
- in West Virginia.
- [sighs] David... Lord.


2151
01:35:14.686 --> 01:35:17.592
I told them this was years
before I even met Richard.


2152
01:35:17.727 --> 01:35:20.093
I told them a couple times.

2153
01:35:21.232 --> 01:35:22.232
Still.

2154
01:35:23.763 --> 01:35:25.032
I'm sorry.

2155
01:35:26.436 --> 01:35:27.694
It's... [sighs]

2156
01:35:28.899 --> 01:35:30.096
It...

2157
01:35:30.231 --> 01:35:32.868
It's okay. Yeah.

2158
01:35:33.004 --> 01:35:34.976
[sniffs] Yep.

2159
01:35:40.277 --> 01:35:42.010
[clears throat] It's okay.

2160
01:35:42.145 --> 01:35:43.483
I did what was...

2161
01:35:43.618 --> 01:35:44.618
[unmutes TV]

2162
01:35:44.719 --> 01:35:46.152
[explosions on TV]

2163
01:35:47.051 --> 01:35:48.986
Hey. Hey, turn...

2164
01:35:49.121 --> 01:35:52.754
Come on! What are you doing?

2165
01:35:52.890 --> 01:35:56.288
We can't be watching movies
with bombs and explosions


2166
01:35:56.424 --> 01:35:57.658
when they're listening.

2167
01:35:58.635 --> 01:35:59.764
[Bobi inhales sharply]

2168
01:35:59.899 --> 01:36:01.035
[Richard] Come...

2169
01:36:03.837 --> 01:36:05.336
[Bobi stifles sob]

2170
01:36:08.642 --> 01:36:11.176
Y'all

2171
01:36:11.311 --> 01:36:14.414
I'm... I'm trying to do
the right thing.


2172
01:36:14.549 --> 01:36:16.410
Right?

2173
01:36:16.545 --> 01:36:18.855
Guys... Are they not listening?

2174
01:36:19.985 --> 01:36:21.286
[stifled sob]

2175
01:36:26.222 --> 01:36:27.694
[Bobi sobbing]

2176
01:36:27.829 --> 01:36:30.163
Hey, Mama, I'm sorry.

2177
01:36:32.931 --> 01:36:34.835
Mama, I'm sorry.

2178
01:36:34.970 --> 01:36:36.966
Please? [Lightly knocks on door]

2179
01:36:37.101 --> 01:36:38.302
Mama, come on out.

2180
01:36:38.438 --> 01:36:40.866
We can watch
whatever you wanna watch.


2181
01:36:41.002 --> 01:36:43.808
- [Bobi continues sobbing]
- Uh, I don't mind.


2182
01:36:43.944 --> 01:36:46.012
Mama, please [sighs]

2183
01:36:46.148 --> 01:36:48.312
I won't say nothing
about anything.


2184
01:36:48.448 --> 01:36:50.579
- Just come on out.
- [sobbing continues]


2185
01:36:55.351 --> 01:36:57.357
Mama, I'm sorry. I'm...

2186
01:36:57.493 --> 01:36:59.086
Please?

2187
01:36:59.222 --> 01:37:00.655
Mama, please?

2188
01:37:08.804 --> 01:37:10.170
[continues sobbing]

2189
01:37:11.805 --> 01:37:13.203
[softly] I know.

2190
01:37:13.338 --> 01:37:15.373
- I'm scared, Richard.
- I'm.


2191
01:37:16.505 --> 01:37:18.013
I'm right there with you.

2192
01:37:19.307 --> 01:37:20.642
It's all right.

2193
01:37:21.881 --> 01:37:23.415
[sniffling]

2194
01:37:23.550 --> 01:37:27.220
I don't know how to protect
you from these people.


2195
01:37:28.624 --> 01:37:30.025
Hey, you know...

2196
01:37:30.160 --> 01:37:32.660
You know what?
You don't have to protect me.


2197
01:37:32.796 --> 01:37:35.899
I do the protecting. I do.

2198
01:37:36.532 --> 01:37:37.857
Yep.

2199
01:37:39.197 --> 01:37:40.961
Come on. Come on out.

2200
01:37:41.097 --> 01:37:43.077
You just sit down. You watch
whatever you wanna watch.


2201
01:37:43.101 --> 01:37:44.703
I don't care.

2202
01:37:44.839 --> 01:37:46.239
I don't care.

2203
01:37:48.712 --> 01:37:50.639
And I'm sorry I yelled.

2204
01:37:55.052 --> 01:37:58.047
Yeah, she's had about,
mmm, three days


2205
01:37:58.183 --> 01:38:00.084
to be proud of her son,

2206
01:38:00.220 --> 01:38:03.256
and then taken away from her.

2207
01:38:04.387 --> 01:38:07.089
Yep. That ain't right.

2208
01:38:07.225 --> 01:38:08.624
I'm sorry, Richard.

2209
01:38:14.262 --> 01:38:15.565
Hey.

2210
01:38:17.569 --> 01:38:19.404
You ready to start
fighting back?


2211
01:38:22.270 --> 01:38:23.606
Yeah.

2212
01:38:29.116 --> 01:38:30.409
[camera shutters clicking]

2213
01:38:30.544 --> 01:38:32.049
[car horn beeping]

2214
01:38:32.184 --> 01:38:33.715
[reporters clamoring]

2215
01:38:42.565 --> 01:38:43.965
Richard!

2216
01:38:44.101 --> 01:38:46.332
Are you here
to turn yourself in?


2217
01:38:52.804 --> 01:38:56.538
Don't see why we can't
just let the FBI do this.


2218
01:38:56.674 --> 01:38:59.312
Uh, you trust them
with the results?


2219
01:38:59.447 --> 01:39:01.875
You're in good hands here.
Just breathe.


2220
01:39:04.522 --> 01:39:08.321
Richard, whose idea was it for
you to take a polygraph test?


2221
01:39:08.922 --> 01:39:09.990
Watson's.

2222
01:39:10.125 --> 01:39:11.657
How do you think
you'll do on it?


2223
01:39:11.792 --> 01:39:12.792
Fine.

2224
01:39:12.928 --> 01:39:14.492
[polygraph whirring]

2225
01:39:17.235 --> 01:39:19.194
Do you know who put that bomb
in Olympic Park?


2226
01:39:19.329 --> 01:39:20.696
[inhales sharply]

2227
01:39:25.575 --> 01:39:29.771
No, I do not know who planted
the bomb in Centennial Park.


2228
01:39:33.180 --> 01:39:34.300
Hey, maybe we better talk...

2229
01:39:34.409 --> 01:39:36.182
Nah. He passed.

2230
01:39:36.317 --> 01:39:38.646
Highest level.
No deception indicated.


2231
01:39:38.782 --> 01:39:41.451
- Oh, Jesus Christ.
- [Nadya chuckles]


2232
01:39:41.587 --> 01:39:43.988
- Oh, my God.
- [Rackleff chuckles]


2233
01:39:44.123 --> 01:39:45.985
Thanks, man. Hey.

2234
01:39:46.696 --> 01:39:47.993
Thank you.

2235
01:39:48.128 --> 01:39:50.059
Hey. Look at you, huh?

2236
01:39:50.194 --> 01:39:51.667
You did it, man.

2237
01:39:51.803 --> 01:39:52.935
[Richard] Yeah, we did it.

2238
01:39:53.071 --> 01:39:54.432
[Watson] You did it. You did it.

2239
01:39:54.568 --> 01:39:56.403
[Bill Clinton]
<i>We must be firm in this.</i>


2240
01:39:56.539 --> 01:39:58.603
<i>We cannot be intimidated
by acts of terror.</i>


2241
01:39:58.739 --> 01:40:01.367
<i>I want to thank
the brave security personnel.</i>


2242
01:40:01.502 --> 01:40:03.069
[Kathy laughing]

2243
01:40:03.204 --> 01:40:04.449
[Ron] Cocaine use is up
from women in their sixties.


2244
01:40:04.473 --> 01:40:05.907
[Kathy] Yeah?

2245
01:40:06.042 --> 01:40:07.352
- [Ron] Yeah. Look at that.
- [Kathy] Lucky them.


2246
01:40:07.376 --> 01:40:08.782
[both laughing]

2247
01:40:08.918 --> 01:40:10.952
Holy shit, it's Jewell.

2248
01:40:11.087 --> 01:40:12.327
[Watson] Is that Kathy Scruggs?

2249
01:40:12.820 --> 01:40:14.189
Hey.

2250
01:40:14.324 --> 01:40:16.650
Is this what it's like
behind the curtain?


2251
01:40:16.785 --> 01:40:18.391
- Richard Jewell here.
- Hello.


2252
01:40:18.526 --> 01:40:20.856
We're just about to
go demand a retraction.


2253
01:40:20.991 --> 01:40:22.842
Then we're gonna go get
a hamburger. You wanna come?


2254
01:40:22.866 --> 01:40:24.357
- Is that right?
- Yeah.


2255
01:40:24.492 --> 01:40:25.727
This is, I mean,

2256
01:40:25.862 --> 01:40:27.180
this is, like,
top-rate science fiction.


2257
01:40:27.204 --> 01:40:29.231
"Bomb suspect sought limelight."

2258
01:40:29.367 --> 01:40:30.896
Are you kidding me?

2259
01:40:31.032 --> 01:40:32.372
Who the hell
do you think you are?


2260
01:40:32.507 --> 01:40:34.240
Mr. Bryant, what I do is
I report the facts.


2261
01:40:34.376 --> 01:40:35.481
You lead the public,
is what you do.


2262
01:40:35.505 --> 01:40:36.505
I report the facts.

2263
01:40:36.581 --> 01:40:37.839
The facts?

2264
01:40:37.974 --> 01:40:39.058
[Kathy] That's right.
That's what I do.


2265
01:40:39.082 --> 01:40:40.379
- You ignorant...
- Excuse me?


2266
01:40:40.515 --> 01:40:42.249
- Arrogant, ambitious...
- Excuse me?


2267
01:40:42.385 --> 01:40:44.250
- How did you get this job?
- [chuckles]


2268
01:40:44.386 --> 01:40:46.046
- How'd I get this job?
- [Watson] Yeah.


2269
01:40:46.181 --> 01:40:47.663
Mr. Bryant, if you have
an issue, you can take it up


2270
01:40:47.687 --> 01:40:48.835
with the FBI
for investigating your client.


2271
01:40:48.859 --> 01:40:50.093
[Watson] Oh, bullshit.

2272
01:40:50.228 --> 01:40:51.435
It has nothing to do with me.
All right?


2273
01:40:51.459 --> 01:40:52.986
What I do is, I hear the facts,

2274
01:40:53.121 --> 01:40:54.537
I report them.
That is my responsibility.


2275
01:40:54.561 --> 01:40:56.001
The facts?
What about the truth, huh?


2276
01:40:56.091 --> 01:40:58.098
My guiding principle
is to report the facts.


2277
01:40:58.233 --> 01:40:59.597
[Watson]
What fucking principles?


2278
01:40:59.732 --> 01:41:01.428
This isn't a principle
standing next to me.


2279
01:41:01.564 --> 01:41:02.763
Fuck your principle.

2280
01:41:02.898 --> 01:41:04.268
This man's name
is Richard Jewell.


2281
01:41:04.403 --> 01:41:05.933
He's a hero. He saved lives.

2282
01:41:06.068 --> 01:41:07.386
You're unbelievable,
just coming in here.


2283
01:41:07.410 --> 01:41:08.848
I'm unbelievable?
Do you have any idea


2284
01:41:08.872 --> 01:41:11.275
what kinda wildfire you started?

2285
01:41:11.411 --> 01:41:13.810
You've ruined this man's life.

2286
01:41:13.945 --> 01:41:15.862
- Maybe you owe him an apology.
- [Kathy] Listen...


2287
01:41:15.886 --> 01:41:16.886
[Watson] How about that?

2288
01:41:16.953 --> 01:41:18.480
Mr... Mr. Jewell, I...

2289
01:41:18.615 --> 01:41:20.248
You know, you are a... What?

2290
01:41:20.383 --> 01:41:21.818
I said I'm sorry

2291
01:41:21.953 --> 01:41:23.502
for what you and your mother
have gone through.


2292
01:41:23.526 --> 01:41:25.919
Oh, you are a miserable excuse
for a journalist.


2293
01:41:26.054 --> 01:41:27.760
- You're a parasite.
- You know what...


2294
01:41:27.895 --> 01:41:30.596
[Watson] Anything to sell a
goddamn paper, you know that?


2295
01:41:30.731 --> 01:41:32.828
[Kathy] Why don't you go chase
another ambulance?


2296
01:41:33.528 --> 01:41:34.764
Kiss my ass.

2297
01:41:35.629 --> 01:41:36.931
[Kathy chuckles]

2298
01:41:38.937 --> 01:41:40.847
- He's out of order.
- Y'all can go back to work.


2299
01:41:40.871 --> 01:41:42.122
There's nothing really
to watch here.


2300
01:41:42.146 --> 01:41:43.905
You can just keep
doing your jobs.


2301
01:41:46.079 --> 01:41:47.447
[both scoff]

2302
01:41:49.587 --> 01:41:50.587
Wow.

2303
01:42:26.955 --> 01:42:28.389
He didn't do it.

2304
01:42:32.323 --> 01:42:33.724
Oh, fuck.

2305
01:42:41.769 --> 01:42:43.489
You got a lot of fucking nerve
sitting here.


2306
01:42:43.605 --> 01:42:46.071
[sighs] Jewell couldn't
have made the call.


2307
01:42:46.206 --> 01:42:47.739
The math is wrong.

2308
01:42:47.875 --> 01:42:49.620
I covered the distance
from the site to the phones.


2309
01:42:49.644 --> 01:42:51.404
There's no way he would
have made it in time.


2310
01:42:53.147 --> 01:42:54.283
Yeah, we know.

2311
01:42:55.643 --> 01:42:56.780
You know?

2312
01:42:58.054 --> 01:42:59.222
He had an accomplice.

2313
01:43:00.055 --> 01:43:01.085
An accomplice?

2314
01:43:01.221 --> 01:43:03.059
Sure. Why not?

2315
01:43:03.194 --> 01:43:05.722
What about
the lone bomber profile?


2316
01:43:05.857 --> 01:43:07.928
The wannabe cop?
With an accomplice?


2317
01:43:08.064 --> 01:43:09.431
Well, first of all,

2318
01:43:09.566 --> 01:43:11.729
profiles are always
just a jumping-off point.


2319
01:43:11.864 --> 01:43:14.193
Oklahoma City had two bombers,
if you remember.


2320
01:43:15.503 --> 01:43:18.033
Okay, so who did it? Who is it?

2321
01:43:18.168 --> 01:43:20.774
Like I'm gonna tell you
after the way you burned me.


2322
01:43:20.909 --> 01:43:22.311
Fine.

2323
01:43:22.446 --> 01:43:23.451
I'll just write
that the case against Jewell


2324
01:43:23.475 --> 01:43:24.709
is starting to weaken.

2325
01:43:24.844 --> 01:43:27.581
Bad facts, et cetera.
See how that goes.


2326
01:43:27.716 --> 01:43:29.716
You know what? I'm not sure
where you get this idea


2327
01:43:29.850 --> 01:43:34.282
that I work for you,
or that we work together.


2328
01:43:34.417 --> 01:43:36.921
[scoffs] I don't even know why
I'm fucking talking to you.


2329
01:43:37.057 --> 01:43:39.592
I know why. And you need me
just as much as I need you.


2330
01:43:40.889 --> 01:43:42.922
You know what, sweetheart?

2331
01:43:43.057 --> 01:43:44.696
I don't need you a goddamn bit.

2332
01:43:55.973 --> 01:43:57.742
[Kathy] Can I have one more,
please?


2333
01:44:01.609 --> 01:44:04.085
- Next to me is Bobi Jewell...
- [camera shutters clicking]


2334
01:44:04.220 --> 01:44:06.619
mother of Richard Jewell.

2335
01:44:07.653 --> 01:44:10.192
By some savage twist of fate,

2336
01:44:10.327 --> 01:44:12.020
Richard Jewell
has been wrongfully


2337
01:44:12.155 --> 01:44:14.693
and falsely accused
of murder and mayhem.


2338
01:44:16.296 --> 01:44:17.929
Her son's accusers

2339
01:44:18.065 --> 01:44:21.634
are two of the most powerful
forces in the world today.


2340
01:44:21.769 --> 01:44:25.940
The United States government
and the media.


2341
01:44:26.076 --> 01:44:27.309
For the past four weeks,

2342
01:44:27.444 --> 01:44:29.575
these horrific forces
have combined


2343
01:44:29.711 --> 01:44:32.975
to make her daily existence
a living hell.


2344
01:44:34.115 --> 01:44:35.483
As I speak,

2345
01:44:35.618 --> 01:44:38.354
they continue to crush
the very life out of her


2346
01:44:39.253 --> 01:44:41.023
and her only son.

2347
01:44:41.158 --> 01:44:43.149
I introduce Barbara Jewell,

2348
01:44:43.285 --> 01:44:46.857
the 113th victim
of the Centennial bombing.


2349
01:44:52.927 --> 01:44:54.095
[Bobi clears throat]

2350
01:44:57.372 --> 01:45:00.341
My name is Barbara Jewell.

2351
01:45:00.477 --> 01:45:02.737
I am employed
as a claims coordinator


2352
01:45:02.873 --> 01:45:05.137
with a local insurance agency,

2353
01:45:05.273 --> 01:45:07.812
and I have worked there
for 13 years.


2354
01:45:09.110 --> 01:45:11.416
Approximately four weeks ago,

2355
01:45:11.551 --> 01:45:14.486
over 100 people were injured

2356
01:45:14.621 --> 01:45:17.756
and two people lost their lives

2357
01:45:17.891 --> 01:45:21.729
as a result
of the Olympic Park bombing.


2358
01:45:21.865 --> 01:45:26.094
My heart goes out to these
victims and their families.


2359
01:45:29.106 --> 01:45:31.330
I am so very drained.

2360
01:45:33.374 --> 01:45:34.839
I hope and pray to God

2361
01:45:34.974 --> 01:45:37.908
that nobody ever has to
go through this again.


2362
01:45:39.777 --> 01:45:41.209
I do not think any of you

2363
01:45:41.344 --> 01:45:44.519
can even begin to imagine
what our lives are like.


2364
01:45:46.555 --> 01:45:48.556
The media has portrayed my son

2365
01:45:50.386 --> 01:45:54.056
as the person
who has committed this crime.


2366
01:45:55.631 --> 01:45:59.232
They have taken
all privacy from us.


2367
01:45:59.368 --> 01:46:01.404
They have taken all peace.

2368
01:46:03.036 --> 01:46:07.036
They watch and photograph
everything we do.


2369
01:46:08.946 --> 01:46:10.541
Like the media,

2370
01:46:10.677 --> 01:46:14.910
the FBI follows his every move

2371
01:46:15.046 --> 01:46:18.080
and watches my home constantly.

2372
01:46:19.054 --> 01:46:20.313
And why?

2373
01:46:21.620 --> 01:46:22.986
[voice breaks] My son...

2374
01:46:33.533 --> 01:46:35.801
My son is innocent.

2375
01:46:38.333 --> 01:46:41.444
Richard is not
the Olympic Park bomber.


2376
01:46:43.214 --> 01:46:45.981
Richard is not a murderer.

2377
01:46:46.117 --> 01:46:48.880
He saved people's lives.

2378
01:46:52.117 --> 01:46:57.317
Please hear me, Mr. President,
and help me.


2379
01:46:57.452 --> 01:47:00.287
You have the power
to end this nightmare.


2380
01:47:01.164 --> 01:47:03.323
My son is a hero.

2381
01:47:04.666 --> 01:47:07.965
I think the FBI
knows that by now.


2382
01:47:10.234 --> 01:47:13.975
If they do not intend
to charge my son,


2383
01:47:14.110 --> 01:47:15.709
please tell us.

2384
01:47:16.741 --> 01:47:18.778
Please tell the world.

2385
01:47:19.941 --> 01:47:21.616
Mr. President.

2386
01:47:28.790 --> 01:47:33.023
[crying]
Please clear my son's name.


2387
01:47:42.672 --> 01:47:44.463
- [Watson, softly] Okay.
- [Bobi sniffles]


2388
01:47:55.746 --> 01:47:57.014
[continues crying]

2389
01:47:59.651 --> 01:48:00.952
You did good.

2390
01:48:03.093 --> 01:48:04.153
[Bobi] Richard.

2391
01:48:08.462 --> 01:48:09.558
[Richard whimpers]

2392
01:48:09.693 --> 01:48:11.358
Oh, Mama.

2393
01:48:12.469 --> 01:48:14.900
Oh, thank you for doing that.

2394
01:48:16.799 --> 01:48:18.171
[shuddering]

2395
01:48:18.307 --> 01:48:20.037
Oh, I'm sorry.

2396
01:48:21.379 --> 01:48:23.673
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I cried.

2397
01:48:23.809 --> 01:48:25.504
I... I didn't mean to cry.

2398
01:48:25.640 --> 01:48:27.913
No, you did real good.
You did better than good.


2399
01:48:28.910 --> 01:48:31.046
You ready?

2400
01:48:31.181 --> 01:48:33.413
Let's go show them who you are.

2401
01:48:34.959 --> 01:48:36.520
Oh, God.

2402
01:48:36.656 --> 01:48:38.554
I'm so glad that's over.

2403
01:48:38.690 --> 01:48:39.859
You did good.

2404
01:48:50.835 --> 01:48:52.366
[quietly] All right.

2405
01:49:28.442 --> 01:49:29.843
[phone ringing]

2406
01:49:36.553 --> 01:49:37.977
Gentlemen, please have a seat.

2407
01:49:38.113 --> 01:49:39.314
We'll be right with you.

2408
01:49:40.113 --> 01:49:41.283
[Richard sighs]

2409
01:49:44.524 --> 01:49:45.760
[exhales]

2410
01:49:49.559 --> 01:49:51.319
All right, let me tell you
how it's gonna go.


2411
01:49:51.365 --> 01:49:54.395
They're gonna ask to see me
first, set the ground rules.


2412
01:49:54.530 --> 01:49:57.497
I wanna make sure
they know I'm not gay.


2413
01:49:59.634 --> 01:50:02.811
Richard, I think
we got bigger fish to fry,


2414
01:50:02.946 --> 01:50:05.608
but, uh, you'll get the chance
to tell them that.


2415
01:50:05.743 --> 01:50:07.111
I'm sure.

2416
01:50:09.483 --> 01:50:11.016
Agent Shaw.

2417
01:50:22.327 --> 01:50:24.667
Dare you to see
if he's got any Snickers.


2418
01:50:25.929 --> 01:50:26.929
Kinda hungry.

2419
01:50:26.995 --> 01:50:28.460
[Richard sighs]

2420
01:50:28.596 --> 01:50:30.805
You know what a 1001 is, Radar?

2421
01:50:32.271 --> 01:50:34.967
Yes, sir.
It's lying to a federal agent.


2422
01:50:35.103 --> 01:50:36.371
It's a felony.

2423
01:50:36.506 --> 01:50:38.807
You say anything in there
that isn't true,


2424
01:50:38.943 --> 01:50:40.109
they can put you in jail

2425
01:50:40.245 --> 01:50:41.556
without ever proving
you're a bomber.


2426
01:50:41.580 --> 01:50:43.477
Hey.

2427
01:50:43.613 --> 01:50:46.048
You don't know what to say,
you say nothing.


2428
01:50:46.183 --> 01:50:47.463
You ask for a five-minute break,

2429
01:50:47.589 --> 01:50:49.291
you consult with me.

2430
01:50:49.426 --> 01:50:51.357
You do not improvise.

2431
01:50:51.493 --> 01:50:52.618
You got that?

2432
01:50:53.989 --> 01:50:55.490
Yes, sir.

2433
01:50:55.625 --> 01:50:57.623
So if you don't know
what to say, what do you do?


2434
01:50:57.758 --> 01:50:59.438
- I don't say a damn thing.
- That's right.


2435
01:50:59.533 --> 01:51:00.560
Mr. Bryant?

2436
01:51:06.705 --> 01:51:08.040
[sighs heavily]

2437
01:51:11.876 --> 01:51:13.177
[phone rings]

2438
01:51:21.390 --> 01:51:22.521
Can I help you?

2439
01:51:22.657 --> 01:51:25.090
I was taking a look.

2440
01:51:30.024 --> 01:51:31.226
[sighs]

2441
01:51:31.361 --> 01:51:33.065
How do you guys
wanna handle this?


2442
01:51:35.532 --> 01:51:36.916
[Tom] Well, we're gonna ask you
some questions,


2443
01:51:36.940 --> 01:51:37.734
and you're gonna
give us some answers.


2444
01:51:37.869 --> 01:51:39.071
How's that sound?

2445
01:51:40.375 --> 01:51:41.502
Okay.

2446
01:51:42.202 --> 01:51:43.772
Sounds good.

2447
01:51:43.907 --> 01:51:45.407
I'll go get him.

2448
01:51:47.143 --> 01:51:48.743
Hey, you ready, boyo?

2449
01:51:48.878 --> 01:51:49.911
Yeah.

2450
01:51:50.046 --> 01:51:51.176
I think so. Yeah.

2451
01:51:51.311 --> 01:51:52.578
No, I mean ready.

2452
01:51:52.714 --> 01:51:54.224
Look at these guys
not as suspect to agent,


2453
01:51:54.248 --> 01:51:55.848
but as cop to cop.

2454
01:51:55.983 --> 01:51:57.968
Don't give them any more
deference than they're due.


2455
01:51:57.992 --> 01:51:59.555
And don't keep
calling them "sir."


2456
01:51:59.691 --> 01:52:02.930
Yeah, well, they're still
the United States government.


2457
01:52:03.065 --> 01:52:04.643
No, they aren't
the United States government.


2458
01:52:04.667 --> 01:52:06.032
They're just three pricks

2459
01:52:06.167 --> 01:52:07.207
who work for
the United States government.


2460
01:52:07.231 --> 01:52:08.596
You understand the difference?

2461
01:52:08.731 --> 01:52:11.635
Nobody in that room
is a better man than you.


2462
01:52:11.770 --> 01:52:12.940
You understand?

2463
01:52:13.540 --> 01:52:14.671
Come on.

2464
01:52:14.806 --> 01:52:16.240
You'll be fine.

2465
01:52:21.710 --> 01:52:23.583
[whispers] That's it.
Sit right there.


2466
01:52:23.718 --> 01:52:24.747
[Richard] Right here?

2467
01:52:24.883 --> 01:52:25.883
[Watson] Yeah.

2468
01:52:33.387 --> 01:52:34.588
[Watson clears throat]

2469
01:52:35.896 --> 01:52:37.122
Thank you for joining us.

2470
01:52:37.257 --> 01:52:38.763
Uh, Mr. Jewell,

2471
01:52:38.899 --> 01:52:40.198
we've got a few questions,

2472
01:52:40.333 --> 01:52:43.130
regarding the events
of July 27th, 1996,


2473
01:52:43.265 --> 01:52:44.631
as you probably know.

2474
01:52:44.766 --> 01:52:47.634
Specifically the bombing
in Centennial Park.


2475
01:52:54.115 --> 01:52:56.645
Mr. Jewell,
you ever find yourself


2476
01:52:56.781 --> 01:53:01.485
accessing a Internet site
called Candyman's Candy land


2477
01:53:01.620 --> 01:53:05.656
regarding the contents
of<i>The Anarchist Cookbook?</i>


2478
01:53:05.791 --> 01:53:08.190
No, I have not.

2479
01:53:08.325 --> 01:53:09.925
But you do have police training

2480
01:53:10.061 --> 01:53:11.696
in handling explosives?

2481
01:53:11.832 --> 01:53:14.165
Asked and answered.

2482
01:53:14.301 --> 01:53:16.037
Did you ever collect
any pieces of pipe


2483
01:53:16.172 --> 01:53:19.732
from, uh, the construction
of Centennial Park?


2484
01:53:20.675 --> 01:53:22.537
No, I did not.

2485
01:53:22.673 --> 01:53:25.975
Do you remember telling
anybody at the park, uh,


2486
01:53:26.110 --> 01:53:27.476
"Take my picture now,

2487
01:53:27.611 --> 01:53:29.678
because pretty soon
I'm gonna be famous"?


2488
01:53:29.814 --> 01:53:31.176
No, sir.

2489
01:53:31.312 --> 01:53:32.387
[Tom] Really?

2490
01:53:32.523 --> 01:53:33.922
You sure about that?

2491
01:53:34.852 --> 01:53:36.353
100%.

2492
01:53:38.386 --> 01:53:39.725
How about, did you say,

2493
01:53:39.861 --> 01:53:41.026
"I'm on my way to Atlanta.

2494
01:53:41.162 --> 01:53:43.063
It's gonna be a mess out there"?

2495
01:53:43.198 --> 01:53:46.165
[sighs] I was referring
to the traffic jams.


2496
01:53:47.635 --> 01:53:49.003
Mr. Jewell,

2497
01:53:49.138 --> 01:53:51.166
why specifically did
you want to be stationed


2498
01:53:51.302 --> 01:53:54.072
at that sound and light tower?

2499
01:53:54.208 --> 01:53:57.672
I just liked
listening to the music,


2500
01:53:57.808 --> 01:54:00.077
and, the night before,
I got to bring my mama down.


2501
01:54:00.212 --> 01:54:03.541
We got to listen
to Kenny Rogers.


2502
01:54:03.677 --> 01:54:06.812
She liked that. 
That was nice.

2503
01:54:06.947 --> 01:54:10.750
And I guess I also get
a nice vantage point


2504
01:54:10.885 --> 01:54:13.720
to take a look at
all the pretty girls.


2505
01:54:15.126 --> 01:54:16.928
I am not a homosexual.

2506
01:54:17.064 --> 01:54:20.528
And neither is David Dutchess.

2507
01:54:20.664 --> 01:54:23.031
So you and David Dutchess
are not lovers?


2508
01:54:23.167 --> 01:54:24.203
Asked and answered.

2509
01:54:25.907 --> 01:54:28.043
Mr. Jewell, you said before

2510
01:54:28.178 --> 01:54:30.574
that in your comings
and goings back and forth


2511
01:54:30.710 --> 01:54:33.608
from the stage to the tower
that you couldn't get, uh,


2512
01:54:33.743 --> 01:54:36.380
an exact fix on the time.
Is that correct?


2513
01:54:37.850 --> 01:54:39.050
[hesitates]

2514
01:54:39.186 --> 01:54:42.116
Yes, but when you have the runs,

2515
01:54:42.252 --> 01:54:44.256
which I did, excuse me,

2516
01:54:44.391 --> 01:54:46.759
you're not thinking
about what time it is.


2517
01:54:46.894 --> 01:54:48.462
You're just trying to

2518
01:54:48.597 --> 01:54:49.798
[chuckles]

2519
01:54:49.933 --> 01:54:53.230
Crab-walk to a bathroom,
you know?


2520
01:54:53.366 --> 01:54:55.734
So you don't remember
the exact time


2521
01:54:55.870 --> 01:54:57.401
that you saw the drunks

2522
01:54:57.536 --> 01:54:59.307
throwing the beer cans
against the tower?


2523
01:54:59.442 --> 01:55:00.442
Right?

2524
01:55:01.345 --> 01:55:02.602
No.

2525
01:55:02.738 --> 01:55:04.140
You don't remember
the exact time


2526
01:55:04.275 --> 01:55:06.139
you first saw the backpack?

2527
01:55:06.274 --> 01:55:07.908
That's correct.

2528
01:55:08.044 --> 01:55:10.750
You ever seen a backpack
like that before, Mr. Jewell?


2529
01:55:10.886 --> 01:55:13.144
Yeah, I suppose so. Yeah.

2530
01:55:13.280 --> 01:55:15.923
You ever see that specific
backpack before, Mr. Jewell?


2531
01:55:16.059 --> 01:55:18.151
Asked and answered.
Can we move on?


2532
01:55:18.286 --> 01:55:20.624
Mr. Jewell,

2533
01:55:20.759 --> 01:55:24.096
did you conspire with
David Dutchess or anybody else


2534
01:55:24.232 --> 01:55:27.266
to plant a bomb
in Centennial Park?


2535
01:55:29.166 --> 01:55:30.302
[people screaming]

2536
01:55:34.006 --> 01:55:35.439
[women crying]

2537
01:55:37.109 --> 01:55:38.343
[panicked shouting]

2538
01:55:39.944 --> 01:55:41.377
No.

2539
01:55:41.513 --> 01:55:42.913
[Tom] Then how the fuck
did you know


2540
01:55:43.010 --> 01:55:45.010
to be on the other side
of that AT&T tower


2541
01:55:45.145 --> 01:55:47.782
where you knew you'd be
protected from the blast?


2542
01:55:47.917 --> 01:55:50.288
A bomb went off right
where you were stationed.


2543
01:55:50.423 --> 01:55:52.487
Chaos erupts.
Bodies hit the ground.


2544
01:55:52.623 --> 01:55:54.919
Cops go flying.
Hell, I was one of them.


2545
01:55:55.055 --> 01:55:56.830
You come out
without a goddamn scratch.


2546
01:55:56.966 --> 01:55:58.792
How does that happen, Richard?

2547
01:56:02.233 --> 01:56:03.764
[inhales, scoffs softly]

2548
01:56:06.736 --> 01:56:08.641
Can I ask all you fellas
a question?


2549
01:56:08.776 --> 01:56:10.771
Jesus. What?

2550
01:56:14.250 --> 01:56:17.518
Do you have any kind
of case against me?


2551
01:56:17.653 --> 01:56:18.981
[Tom scoffs]

2552
01:56:19.116 --> 01:56:20.881
I mean evidence.

2553
01:56:21.016 --> 01:56:26.357
Like, any traces of anything
on my mama's Tupperware?


2554
01:56:26.493 --> 01:56:30.532
Or did you find
any bomb-making materials


2555
01:56:30.667 --> 01:56:31.896
in her apartment?

2556
01:56:32.032 --> 01:56:33.061
Or did you find some...

2557
01:56:33.196 --> 01:56:34.398
Okay. Hey, hey.

2558
01:56:34.534 --> 01:56:36.028
Richard, we don't
need to volunteer...


2559
01:56:36.163 --> 01:56:38.565
No. I'm gonna say this
if I'm gonna say anything.


2560
01:56:38.700 --> 01:56:41.272
I walk in here and I look at

2561
01:56:41.408 --> 01:56:43.941
the circle decal
on your windows there,


2562
01:56:44.077 --> 01:56:45.610
and I'm thinking...

2563
01:56:45.746 --> 01:56:49.841
You know, I used to think
that federal law enforcement


2564
01:56:49.976 --> 01:56:52.049
was just about
the highest calling


2565
01:56:52.185 --> 01:56:54.419
a person could aspire to.

2566
01:56:54.555 --> 01:56:57.251
And I'm not sure I think
that anymore, you know?


2567
01:56:57.387 --> 01:56:58.819
Not after all this.

2568
01:57:01.897 --> 01:57:03.659
I did my job that night,

2569
01:57:03.794 --> 01:57:06.233
and some people are alive
because of that.


2570
01:57:07.466 --> 01:57:09.336
But do you think
that the next time


2571
01:57:09.471 --> 01:57:12.369
some security guard
sees a suspicious package,


2572
01:57:12.504 --> 01:57:14.934
that he or she's
gonna call it in?


2573
01:57:16.140 --> 01:57:17.903
I doubt it.

2574
01:57:18.039 --> 01:57:19.319
You know? 'Cause
they're gonna look at that


2575
01:57:19.343 --> 01:57:20.609
and they're gonna think,

2576
01:57:20.745 --> 01:57:23.376
"I don't wanna be
another Richard Jewell.


2577
01:57:23.512 --> 01:57:25.120
So I'm just gonna run."

2578
01:57:27.420 --> 01:57:29.784
How's that make
anybody any safer?


2579
01:57:32.295 --> 01:57:34.721
Y'all can keep following
me around some more


2580
01:57:34.857 --> 01:57:36.957
doing what you're doing.
I can stand it.


2581
01:57:37.092 --> 01:57:40.562
But I just know that
every second you spend on me


2582
01:57:40.698 --> 01:57:41.947
is time that you're not spending

2583
01:57:41.971 --> 01:57:43.169
on the real guy who did it,

2584
01:57:43.304 --> 01:57:44.898
and it's like Watson said.
What...


2585
01:57:47.307 --> 01:57:49.001
What happens when he... [sighs]

2586
01:57:51.610 --> 01:57:53.907
What happens when
he does it again?


2587
01:58:01.284 --> 01:58:02.818
[chuckles]

2588
01:58:02.953 --> 01:58:08.328
So, do you have anything
you wanna charge me with?


2589
01:58:10.262 --> 01:58:11.793
[Tom sighs quietly]

2590
01:58:14.461 --> 01:58:15.764
Can you?

2591
01:58:17.970 --> 01:58:19.306
[sighs]

2592
01:58:26.506 --> 01:58:27.512
Well.

2593
01:58:29.083 --> 01:58:30.779
I think it's time to go.

2594
01:59:02.015 --> 01:59:03.178
How'd he do?

2595
01:59:03.314 --> 01:59:04.351
He did great.

2596
01:59:06.822 --> 01:59:08.685
[chuckles] God.

2597
01:59:09.990 --> 01:59:10.990
[Richard] Yeah.

2598
01:59:14.026 --> 01:59:15.054
Go on.

2599
01:59:29.574 --> 01:59:32.175
- [Watson] Hey.
- Gentlemen.


2600
01:59:32.311 --> 01:59:33.573
[Watson] Agent Shaw.

2601
01:59:33.708 --> 01:59:35.245
Got something for ya.

2602
01:59:35.380 --> 01:59:36.784
[Watson] What's this?

2603
01:59:36.919 --> 01:59:38.176
Marriage proposal.

2604
01:59:38.920 --> 01:59:40.512
[Watson] Oh.

2605
01:59:40.648 --> 01:59:41.949
My lucky day.

2606
01:59:43.187 --> 01:59:44.523
Uh...

2607
01:59:47.829 --> 01:59:48.897
Okay.

2608
01:59:49.032 --> 01:59:50.393
Well, this is a good start.

2609
01:59:50.528 --> 01:59:51.693
When's the press conference?

2610
01:59:51.829 --> 01:59:53.125
I'm assuming
you'll be announcing


2611
01:59:53.260 --> 01:59:55.929
to all the news outlets,
Tom Brokaw and the like.


2612
01:59:56.065 --> 01:59:58.867
Mr. Bryant,
let me be perfectly clear.


2613
01:59:59.003 --> 02:00:01.276
I still think
your client is guilty as hell.


2614
02:00:02.712 --> 02:00:03.712
Hmm?

2615
02:00:07.212 --> 02:00:08.514
Have a nice day.

2616
02:00:10.013 --> 02:00:12.287
Well, you're entitled
to your opinion.


2617
02:00:22.365 --> 02:00:23.638
[Richard] "This is to advise you

2618
02:00:23.662 --> 02:00:25.432
that based on the evidence..."

2619
02:00:29.896 --> 02:00:31.031
[Watson] It's over.

2620
02:00:32.967 --> 02:00:35.739
Is it... Is it really over,

2621
02:00:35.874 --> 02:00:39.479
or is this just another
one of their things?


2622
02:00:41.380 --> 02:00:43.109
You won. It's over.

2623
02:00:52.929 --> 02:00:53.988
[chuckles lightly]

2624
02:01:03.071 --> 02:01:04.570
[chuckles softly]

2625
02:01:10.309 --> 02:01:11.676
You did good.

2626
02:01:15.312 --> 02:01:17.078
[gulps]

2627
02:01:17.213 --> 02:01:20.778
Oh, I wanna see... [sniffs]
I wanna see Mama.


2628
02:01:20.914 --> 02:01:21.914
You wanna see your mama?

2629
02:01:21.990 --> 02:01:22.990
[Richard] Yeah.

2630
02:01:25.589 --> 02:01:26.828
[Watson] We can do that.

2631
02:01:26.963 --> 02:01:28.528
[chuckles, sniffs]

2632
02:01:31.761 --> 02:01:33.368
[taps on paper] that's real?

2633
02:01:36.798 --> 02:01:38.230
That's what it says.

2634
02:01:40.539 --> 02:01:41.969
"Not considered a target

2635
02:01:42.104 --> 02:01:43.640
in the federal
criminal investigation


2636
02:01:43.775 --> 02:01:47.079
of the bombing of
July 27th, 1996,

2638
02:01:54.483 --> 02:01:55.548
Hey.

2639
02:01:55.684 --> 02:01:57.023
[Watson] Hey.

2640
02:01:57.158 --> 02:01:58.355
[breathes shakily]

2641
02:01:58.491 --> 02:01:59.889
- Hey.
- [faintly] Hey.


2642
02:02:01.194 --> 02:02:02.863
Thank you.

2643
02:02:02.998 --> 02:02:04.223
Thank you.

2644
02:02:05.695 --> 02:02:07.061
[Watson] You got it.

2645
02:02:10.702 --> 02:02:11.901
[Richard, faintly] Thank you.

2646
02:02:13.370 --> 02:02:14.376
Hey.

2647
02:02:19.015 --> 02:02:20.146
[sobbing quietly]

2648
02:02:20.281 --> 02:02:21.281
[Watson, softly] Hey.

2649
02:02:28.320 --> 02:02:29.919
[knock on door]

2650
02:03:00.121 --> 02:03:01.621
[Bobi gasps]

2651
02:03:32.917 --> 02:03:34.621
- [door opens]
- [phone rings]


2652
02:03:42.660 --> 02:03:44.822
Hello, Watson Bryant.

2653
02:03:44.958 --> 02:03:45.958
[Watson] Hey.

2654
02:03:46.092 --> 02:03:47.365
What can I do you for?

2655
02:03:47.501 --> 02:03:49.597
How are you? How's, uh...

2656
02:03:49.733 --> 02:03:51.305
My God, how's Nadya?

2657
02:03:51.440 --> 02:03:53.303
[Watson] They found him,
Richard.


2658
02:03:53.438 --> 02:03:54.502
Found who?

2659
02:03:54.638 --> 02:03:56.203
