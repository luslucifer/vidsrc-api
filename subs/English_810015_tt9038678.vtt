1
00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.980
Hey. Come on.

2
00:02:06.014 --> 00:02:07.582
Beat it.

3
00:02:20.862 --> 00:02:22.530
Stay.

4
00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:08.136
Hmm.

5
00:05:12.834 --> 00:05:13.901
Am I late?

6
00:05:13.935 --> 00:05:15.335
Oh, no! Hi, dad.

7
00:05:15.368 --> 00:05:16.237
Hi.

8
00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:17.370
Hi. How're you feeling?

9
00:05:17.404 --> 00:05:19.273
I'm fine, I'm fine.

10
00:05:27.882 --> 00:05:29.851
Chris was
supposed to graduate this year,


11
00:05:29.884 --> 00:05:31.085
but because of the divorce,

12
00:05:31.118 --> 00:05:33.120
he's just gonna take
a semester off.


13
00:05:34.288 --> 00:05:35.756
Take a semester off?

14
00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:37.424
Yeah, he wants to travel.

15
00:05:37.457 --> 00:05:39.426
He's saved up some money, and...

16
00:05:39.459 --> 00:05:41.038
You should come by the house.
He really misses you.


17
00:05:41.062 --> 00:05:44.565
Well, Renee, I'm... uh...

18
00:05:44.599 --> 00:05:45.766
I'm going to take a few days

19
00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.269
I'm going to go hunting
in my old stomping grounds,


20
00:05:48.302 --> 00:05:49.770
and I'm leaving in the morning.

21
00:05:51.072 --> 00:05:52.773
Oh! Who's going with you?

22
00:05:52.807 --> 00:05:54.242
Rex...

23
00:05:54.275 --> 00:05:55.275
And me.

24
00:05:56.978 --> 00:05:58.946
I've been thinking about it...

25
00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:00.948
For a while.

26
00:06:00.982 --> 00:06:02.382
Are you gonna go see
uncle Aidan?


27
00:06:05.052 --> 00:06:06.721
No.

28
00:06:06.754 --> 00:06:07.755
I just thought that

29
00:06:07.788 --> 00:06:09.590
maybe now things
would be different than...


30
00:06:09.624 --> 00:06:10.992
What would be different?

31
00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:17.397
So when will you be back?

32
00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:18.633
Uh...

33
00:06:18.666 --> 00:06:19.634
Thursday or Friday.

34
00:06:19.667 --> 00:06:22.069
I'm okay, I'm just fine!

35
00:06:22.103 --> 00:06:23.971
I just wanna go
over the mountains,


36
00:06:24.005 --> 00:06:26.374
and let the dog run around,

37
00:06:26.406 --> 00:06:27.608
and walk a little.

38
00:06:28.609 --> 00:06:29.644
Okay.

39
00:06:30.745 --> 00:06:32.421
When you come back,
we're gonna have a serious talk.


40
00:06:32.445 --> 00:06:33.748
A serious talk.

41
00:06:33.781 --> 00:06:34.749
Yes.

42
00:06:34.782 --> 00:06:37.618
About you coming
to live with us.


43
00:06:38.753 --> 00:06:39.720
You know.

44
00:06:39.754 --> 00:06:40.931
If you have to start treatment...

45
00:06:40.955 --> 00:06:42.924
If.

46
00:06:42.957 --> 00:06:45.259
I haven't heard back
from the doctors at all.


47
00:06:45.293 --> 00:06:47.828
So it doesn't make sense
to talk about anything.


48
00:06:47.862 --> 00:06:50.898
Doesn't make sense.

49
00:06:50.932 --> 00:06:52.465
No.

50
00:06:52.499 --> 00:06:53.777
Well, you know
that's what you say


51
00:06:53.801 --> 00:06:55.478
when you just don't want
to talk about something. Right?


52
00:06:55.502 --> 00:06:57.872
Well, I just don't want
to talk about it!


53
00:06:58.973 --> 00:07:00.733
Just like you don't want
to talk about mom...


54
00:07:05.046 --> 00:07:06.013
It's...

55
00:07:06.047 --> 00:07:08.249
It's late.

56
00:07:08.282 --> 00:07:10.127
Dad, I'm sorry, I'm not trying
to box you in or anything.


57
00:07:10.151 --> 00:07:11.686
Chris is in college now

58
00:07:11.719 --> 00:07:13.130
and you just need
someone to take care of.


59
00:07:13.154 --> 00:07:14.188
No!

60
00:07:14.221 --> 00:07:15.799
I'm just concerned
about your health, dad.


61
00:07:15.823 --> 00:07:17.858
I'm not sure my health
is your business.


62
00:07:22.296 --> 00:07:25.366
I've barely seen you
since mom died.


63
00:07:26.667 --> 00:07:28.602
I miss you.

64
00:07:28.636 --> 00:07:30.356
And I just want to spend
some time together.


65
00:07:38.379 --> 00:07:40.513
I... I'm sorry.

66
00:07:40.548 --> 00:07:41.882
I have to go.

67
00:07:41.916 --> 00:07:43.050
Dad...

68
00:09:04.899 --> 00:09:06.734
Come on.

69
00:09:13.674 --> 00:09:15.443
Come on. Up you go.

70
00:09:16.677 --> 00:09:18.112
Up you go. Come on.

71
00:09:39.934 --> 00:09:41.669
<i>Please
leave a message after the tone.</i>


72
00:09:43.504 --> 00:09:44.972
<i>Hi, dad, it's Renee.</i>

73
00:09:45.005 --> 00:09:46.774
<i>I hope I catch you
before you leave.</i>


74
00:09:46.807 --> 00:09:48.142
<i>I'm sorry about last night.</i>

75
00:09:48.175 --> 00:09:50.277
<i>I didn't mean to offend you
or upset you.</i>


76
00:09:50.311 --> 00:09:51.745
<i>I'm just not feeling that great</i>

77
00:09:51.779 --> 00:09:54.815
<i>about this trip that you want
to take all alone.</i>


78
00:09:54.849 --> 00:09:57.518
<i>Will you please call me back
when you get this message?</i>


79
00:09:57.552 --> 00:09:58.519
<i>Thank you, dad.</i>

80
00:09:58.553 --> 00:10:00.921
<i>Love you.</i>

81
00:10:00.955 --> 00:10:02.289
<i>Bye.</i>

82
00:12:02.577 --> 00:12:04.278
Oh!

83
00:12:05.779 --> 00:12:07.414
Oh, Jesus.

84
00:13:00.301 --> 00:13:01.536
Hey, how's it going?

85
00:13:02.836 --> 00:13:04.071
Well, not great.

86
00:13:05.873 --> 00:13:07.374
You got some car trouble?

87
00:13:10.210 --> 00:13:11.512
Yeah.

88
00:13:11.546 --> 00:13:12.681
Need a ride?

89
00:13:12.714 --> 00:13:13.947
Well, I could use one.

90
00:13:13.981 --> 00:13:16.216
I've got a dog, however,
and, um...


91
00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:17.318
Some other things.

92
00:13:17.351 --> 00:13:18.385
That's not a problem.

93
00:13:18.419 --> 00:13:19.353
Okay.

94
00:13:19.386 --> 00:13:21.188
- Thanks.
- Need some help?


95
00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:31.198
No service.

96
00:13:31.231 --> 00:13:34.902
What are you gonna do
with your car?


97
00:13:34.935 --> 00:13:36.103
I'll take care of it.

98
00:13:37.605 --> 00:13:39.039
Where you want us to take you?

99
00:13:39.073 --> 00:13:41.543
I was thinking of hunting
up in frenchman coulee.


100
00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:44.211
Meeting friends up there.

101
00:13:47.281 --> 00:13:48.248
Sweet climbing spot.

102
00:13:48.282 --> 00:13:49.282
Perfect.

103
00:13:52.453 --> 00:13:54.293
Look, I don't want
to take you out of your way.


104
00:13:55.356 --> 00:13:57.291
We're super flexible.
It's not a problem.


105
00:13:58.859 --> 00:14:00.729
I appreciate it, really.
I do appreciate it.


106
00:14:18.445 --> 00:14:19.547
What's his name?

107
00:14:20.715 --> 00:14:21.982
Oh, that's Rex.

108
00:14:24.652 --> 00:14:25.519
Are you from around here?

109
00:14:25.553 --> 00:14:27.087
Oh, I used to be.

110
00:14:29.256 --> 00:14:30.759
Do you still have
family out here?


111
00:14:33.394 --> 00:14:34.796
Not really.

112
00:14:49.443 --> 00:14:50.645
Are you okay?

113
00:14:51.746 --> 00:14:53.147
Oh, yeah, it's just...

114
00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:54.448
Bad back.

115
00:14:55.916 --> 00:14:57.384
I'm okay.

116
00:15:33.187 --> 00:15:34.321
Stay.

117
00:15:41.663 --> 00:15:42.697
You got everything?

118
00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:44.097
Yeah. I'm fine.

119
00:15:44.131 --> 00:15:45.265
I appreciate you doing this.

120
00:15:45.299 --> 00:15:46.300
Giving me a ride.

121
00:15:49.036 --> 00:15:50.337
Um. Here you go.

122
00:15:51.505 --> 00:15:52.574
Uh. Some snacks for later.

123
00:15:55.042 --> 00:15:56.510
We thought you could use it.

124
00:15:56.544 --> 00:15:59.513
Oh, that's really sweet of you.

125
00:15:59.547 --> 00:16:00.882
Thank you very much.

126
00:16:00.915 --> 00:16:02.058
You sure you're gonna be
all right out here?


127
00:16:02.082 --> 00:16:03.317
I'm gonna be fine.

128
00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:04.318
Okay.

129
00:16:04.351 --> 00:16:06.320
I'm gonna be just fine.
Thank you.


130
00:16:06.353 --> 00:16:07.789
You have a good climb?

131
00:16:07.822 --> 00:16:08.823
Thanks.

132
00:16:08.857 --> 00:16:09.924
Okay.

133
00:16:13.994 --> 00:16:15.597
- Bye, Ben!
- So long.


134
00:16:45.192 --> 00:16:46.360
Come on.

135
00:16:51.866 --> 00:16:53.868
Come on, come on.

136
00:16:56.203 --> 00:16:57.539
Come on.

137
00:17:38.813 --> 00:17:40.514
Ah.

138
00:17:42.684 --> 00:17:43.685
Okay, here we go.

139
00:18:00.668 --> 00:18:01.836
Okay, let's go hunting.

140
00:18:04.606 --> 00:18:05.640
Hold up.

141
00:18:08.208 --> 00:18:09.208
Hunt 'em up.

142
00:19:05.033 --> 00:19:06.834
Hmm.

143
00:20:50.004 --> 00:20:51.672
Yeah.

144
00:21:57.004 --> 00:21:58.438
Okay.

145
00:22:24.397 --> 00:22:25.766
Whoo!

146
00:23:52.452 --> 00:23:53.621
Rex!

147
00:23:55.455 --> 00:23:57.792
Dammit.

148
00:23:57.825 --> 00:23:59.459
Rex!

149
00:24:09.136 --> 00:24:10.404
Rex!

150
00:24:17.912 --> 00:24:19.847
Get off!

151
00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:21.415
Get off, dammit!

152
00:24:34.695 --> 00:24:36.397
Oh, god.

153
00:24:46.574 --> 00:24:49.710
Hey. You alone down there?

154
00:24:49.744 --> 00:24:51.178
Can you help me?

155
00:24:52.213 --> 00:24:53.347
My dog's hurt.

156
00:25:00.688 --> 00:25:02.256
You fuckin' shoot my dog?

157
00:25:03.357 --> 00:25:05.059
Your dog had my dog
by the throat.


158
00:25:05.092 --> 00:25:07.561
You coulda just kicked him off.

159
00:25:07.595 --> 00:25:09.163
Give him a good kick,
my dog'll listen.


160
00:25:09.196 --> 00:25:11.165
I did that.

161
00:25:11.198 --> 00:25:12.199
He wasn't listenin'.

162
00:25:21.208 --> 00:25:23.344
Damn it.

163
00:25:23.377 --> 00:25:25.546
Your dog was gonna
rip my dog's throat out.


164
00:25:32.586 --> 00:25:34.955
Maybe I ought
to shoot your dog, too.


165
00:25:36.957 --> 00:25:38.626
You get down on the ground now.

166
00:25:45.099 --> 00:25:46.567
Turn your head away.

167
00:26:04.285 --> 00:26:05.719
You killed my dog.

168
00:26:05.753 --> 00:26:06.754
I'm takin' your gun.

169
00:26:06.787 --> 00:26:08.222
I need that gun.

170
00:26:08.255 --> 00:26:09.457
Shoulda thought of that

171
00:26:09.490 --> 00:26:11.459
before you shot
my best coyote dog.


172
00:26:35.382 --> 00:26:36.450
Good boy.

173
00:26:36.484 --> 00:26:37.451
Hold still...

174
00:26:37.485 --> 00:26:39.086
Hold still.

175
00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:46.861
Okay.

176
00:26:54.802 --> 00:26:55.803
Okay.

177
00:27:08.849 --> 00:27:10.217
I know.

178
00:27:11.418 --> 00:27:13.087
Don't do that. 
Don't do that.

179
00:29:16.544 --> 00:29:17.978
Shh.

180
00:30:07.194 --> 00:30:08.896
Hey.

181
00:30:08.929 --> 00:30:10.230
Hey.

182
00:30:10.264 --> 00:30:11.398
Do you need help?

183
00:30:12.399 --> 00:30:14.401
My dog needs help.

184
00:30:15.770 --> 00:30:17.204
Let's get you into my truck.

185
00:30:40.194 --> 00:30:41.161
A vet I know.

186
00:30:41.195 --> 00:30:43.364
She's going to open her clinic.

187
00:31:12.059 --> 00:31:13.060
You're awake.

188
00:31:15.730 --> 00:31:17.064
You were sound asleep.

189
00:31:22.136 --> 00:31:23.838
He seems to be doing okay
back there.


190
00:31:29.644 --> 00:31:30.645
Anita's here.

191
00:31:44.692 --> 00:31:45.727
Are you the owner?

192
00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:46.661
I am, yes.

193
00:31:46.694 --> 00:31:48.061
Thank you for coming out.

194
00:31:48.095 --> 00:31:49.163
Yeah, of course.

195
00:31:49.196 --> 00:31:50.916
I mean, when he asks me,
how could I say no?


196
00:31:54.669 --> 00:31:56.503
I'm going to open up
the clinic for us, okay?


197
00:31:56.538 --> 00:31:57.504
Okay.

198
00:31:57.539 --> 00:32:00.140
Thanks again.
I owe you something.


199
00:32:00.174 --> 00:32:01.975
No, you don't.

200
00:32:02.009 --> 00:32:03.878
It's not necessary.

201
00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:07.981
Okay.

202
00:32:14.121 --> 00:32:15.122
Ooh...

203
00:32:16.658 --> 00:32:17.659
Are these your stitches?

204
00:32:17.692 --> 00:32:19.126
Yeah.

205
00:32:19.159 --> 00:32:20.427
You a doctor or something?

206
00:32:20.461 --> 00:32:21.563
I was.

207
00:32:22.831 --> 00:32:23.832
What happened?

208
00:32:25.867 --> 00:32:26.935
Dog fight?

209
00:32:26.967 --> 00:32:28.736
Yeah.

210
00:32:31.238 --> 00:32:32.206
Where?

211
00:32:32.239 --> 00:32:33.474
Bird hunting.

212
00:32:33.507 --> 00:32:34.742
Okay...

213
00:32:35.877 --> 00:32:37.020
I'm going to give him
some fluids.


214
00:32:37.044 --> 00:32:39.313
I need to cut out your stitches,

215
00:32:39.346 --> 00:32:40.347
clean him up, sew him up.

216
00:32:42.149 --> 00:32:44.117
I'd say about $500?

217
00:32:44.151 --> 00:32:45.319
Okay.

218
00:32:45.352 --> 00:32:49.089
And he's going to need
to be here a couple nights.


219
00:32:52.927 --> 00:32:53.928
How are your hands?

220
00:32:56.664 --> 00:32:57.832
They're okay.

221
00:32:58.999 --> 00:33:00.367
They're still good.

222
00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:02.302
I don't have anyone
coming to help me.


223
00:33:02.336 --> 00:33:04.071
And I would like
to get some rest


224
00:33:04.104 --> 00:33:06.073
before I have to
come in tomorrow.


225
00:33:06.106 --> 00:33:07.407
You mind helping out?

226
00:33:07.441 --> 00:33:08.442
Okay.

227
00:33:15.850 --> 00:33:17.986
All right, I'm gonna give him...

228
00:33:18.018 --> 00:33:23.758
.32 mils of Dex...

229
00:33:26.193 --> 00:33:27.529
Good job.

230
00:33:29.731 --> 00:33:32.700
And now something for the pain.

231
00:33:34.569 --> 00:33:36.069
Good job, baby.

232
00:33:52.486 --> 00:33:54.121
You don't mind the music,
do you?


233
00:33:54.154 --> 00:33:55.489
No.

234
00:33:57.224 --> 00:33:58.358
That's lucky

235
00:33:58.392 --> 00:33:59.761
because the other answer

236
00:33:59.794 --> 00:34:01.070
would have you
waiting in the lobby,


237
00:34:01.094 --> 00:34:03.565
where you'd still be able
to hear the music.


238
00:34:10.304 --> 00:34:11.271
You do these one-handed?

239
00:34:11.305 --> 00:34:13.007
I did.

240
00:34:14.074 --> 00:34:15.610
They're not bad.

241
00:34:16.644 --> 00:34:19.079
I was a cardiac surgeon
for 50 years in Seattle.


242
00:34:20.414 --> 00:34:22.050
Oh.

243
00:34:22.082 --> 00:34:23.250
You got stories?

244
00:34:23.283 --> 00:34:24.852
Yeah.

245
00:34:29.189 --> 00:34:31.091
Just, you know,
trying to pass the time.


246
00:34:32.192 --> 00:34:33.962
It will pass on its own.

247
00:34:38.833 --> 00:34:41.002
3-0 weblon
with reverse cutting needle.


248
00:34:45.673 --> 00:34:47.307
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.


249
00:35:08.462 --> 00:35:09.463
That's very nice.

250
00:35:11.498 --> 00:35:12.499
I know.

251
00:35:14.401 --> 00:35:15.401
But thanks.

252
00:35:21.042 --> 00:35:22.342
Okay, so I have someone

253
00:35:22.376 --> 00:35:25.647
who comes in
a little later tonight.


254
00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:26.814
She should be here shortly.

255
00:35:27.849 --> 00:35:28.816
What about you?

256
00:35:28.850 --> 00:35:31.218
You got a place to stay tonight?

257
00:35:31.251 --> 00:35:33.220
There's a motel up the street.

258
00:35:33.253 --> 00:35:36.057
It's on the way home.
I can drop you off.


259
00:35:36.090 --> 00:35:37.659
Okay.

260
00:35:47.001 --> 00:35:49.236
Wow, this town sure has changed.

261
00:35:49.269 --> 00:35:50.905
Change is good.

262
00:35:52.239 --> 00:35:54.075
I could not get out of here
fast enough.


263
00:35:54.108 --> 00:35:55.109
Why'd you come back?

264
00:35:57.177 --> 00:35:58.478
My brother died.

265
00:35:58.512 --> 00:36:00.882
And my nephew needed
a stable home.


266
00:36:02.950 --> 00:36:03.951
Mm-hmm.

267
00:36:06.688 --> 00:36:08.331
Well, thank you
for taking care of the dog.


268
00:36:08.355 --> 00:36:09.590
I really appreciate that.

269
00:36:09.624 --> 00:36:11.258
Yeah, no problem.

270
00:36:11.291 --> 00:36:12.527
All right, good night.

271
00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:13.995
And thanks for the ride.

272
00:36:14.028 --> 00:36:15.195
Get some rest.

273
00:36:15.228 --> 00:36:16.229
Yeah.

274
00:38:06.373 --> 00:38:08.009
All right. See you later.

275
00:38:11.511 --> 00:38:13.781
Yes, I brought
the Brittany in last night.


276
00:38:13.815 --> 00:38:15.049
Are you Ben Gibbons?

277
00:38:15.082 --> 00:38:16.349
Anita told me about you.

278
00:38:22.190 --> 00:38:23.423
Okay.

279
00:38:26.928 --> 00:38:28.138
I heard you carried him
all day yesterday


280
00:38:28.162 --> 00:38:29.664
after he was attacked.

281
00:38:29.697 --> 00:38:31.398
He sure wasn't
going to carry me.


282
00:38:34.101 --> 00:38:35.770
Like carrying
my buddy in the war.


283
00:38:36.771 --> 00:38:37.738
World war ii?

284
00:38:37.772 --> 00:38:40.107
Korean war.

285
00:38:42.243 --> 00:38:43.510
How are you doing?

286
00:38:43.544 --> 00:38:45.756
Ben! What're you doing here?
I thought you'd still be asleep!


287
00:38:45.780 --> 00:38:47.815
Hi! Uh...

288
00:38:47.849 --> 00:38:48.850
I had to see him.

289
00:38:48.883 --> 00:38:49.851
He's been through a lot,

290
00:38:49.884 --> 00:38:51.552
so he just needs some rest.

291
00:38:52.687 --> 00:38:54.655
- Yeah.
- Hey.


292
00:38:54.689 --> 00:38:56.757
I have your number at the motel.

293
00:38:56.791 --> 00:38:58.159
I gotcha.

294
00:38:58.192 --> 00:38:59.660
Okay.

295
00:38:59.694 --> 00:39:00.871
Come on, Derek.
I need your help with something.


296
00:39:00.895 --> 00:39:02.039
- Thank you.
- All right, see you later.


297
00:39:02.063 --> 00:39:03.363
Appreciate it.

298
00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:27.480
Hey.

299
00:40:34.454 --> 00:40:36.190
You're usually faster than this.

300
00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:40.995
I can do this all day.

301
00:40:42.964 --> 00:40:45.132
You'll be doing it all day
if you keep that up.


302
00:40:47.535 --> 00:40:48.536
Yeah...

303
00:41:33.114 --> 00:41:34.415
Hello?

304
00:41:34.448 --> 00:41:37.051
<i>Hi, Ben. It's Anita.</i>

305
00:41:38.285 --> 00:41:40.855
Oh, Anita. Yes, uh...

306
00:41:40.888 --> 00:41:42.857
How's Rex?

307
00:41:42.890 --> 00:41:44.325
<i>I looked in on him
before we left.</i>


308
00:41:44.358 --> 00:41:46.460
<i>His vitals look a lot better.</i>

309
00:41:47.862 --> 00:41:49.330
Oh! Okay.

310
00:41:49.363 --> 00:41:51.032
<i>Have you had dinner yet?</i>

311
00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:54.735
No? Dinner?

312
00:41:54.769 --> 00:41:56.437
<i>Yeah.</i>

313
00:41:56.470 --> 00:41:58.939
<i>I'm going to be passing by
in about five minutes.</i>


314
00:41:58.973 --> 00:42:01.375
<i>If I slow down enough,
you think you could jump in?</i>


315
00:42:01.409 --> 00:42:02.743
Jump in?

316
00:42:02.777 --> 00:42:04.278
<i>Yeah.</i>

317
00:42:04.311 --> 00:42:05.913
<i>Come have dinner at my house.</i>

318
00:42:05.946 --> 00:42:07.515
<i>I mean, we sewed up
a dog together.</i>


319
00:42:07.548 --> 00:42:10.017
<i>I think we could at least
make it through a dinner, no?</i>


320
00:42:10.051 --> 00:42:11.685
Oh!

321
00:42:11.719 --> 00:42:15.423
Well, sure, I guess.

322
00:42:15.456 --> 00:42:16.690
Yes, that's fine.

323
00:42:16.724 --> 00:42:18.125
Thank you very much.

324
00:42:18.159 --> 00:42:19.860
I'll see you in five minutes.

325
00:42:19.894 --> 00:42:21.562
<i>Okay, bye!</i>

326
00:42:21.595 --> 00:42:23.397
Bye.

327
00:42:25.066 --> 00:42:27.268
Yeah, okay. Adios. Gracias.

328
00:42:29.236 --> 00:42:31.072
Hey, hey, hey.

329
00:42:31.105 --> 00:42:33.140
Did I mention I don't cook?

330
00:42:33.174 --> 00:42:34.175
Here you go.

331
00:42:35.176 --> 00:42:36.510
Well, thank you.

332
00:42:37.912 --> 00:42:41.082
Yeah, cooking is just
way too claustrophobic for me.


333
00:42:41.115 --> 00:42:43.951
It's like the walls
start to close in and... no.


334
00:42:43.984 --> 00:42:45.119
Derek though.

335
00:42:45.152 --> 00:42:46.387
Derek is a really good cook.

336
00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:48.389
- Cooks dinner most nights, huh?
- Mm-hmm.


337
00:42:52.860 --> 00:42:53.828
How are the tacos?

338
00:42:53.861 --> 00:42:54.861
Not spicy, right?

339
00:42:58.299 --> 00:42:59.800
My mouth is full.

340
00:43:00.868 --> 00:43:02.403
Told you.

341
00:43:02.436 --> 00:43:05.106
The owner
made it special for you.


342
00:43:05.139 --> 00:43:07.007
Oh, well, that was very nice.

343
00:43:08.642 --> 00:43:11.011
Lot more brown faces here
than when you were a kid, huh?


344
00:43:12.113 --> 00:43:13.080
Ah...

345
00:43:13.114 --> 00:43:14.448
Most the pickers

346
00:43:14.482 --> 00:43:17.384
came from Arkansas and Oklahoma
in those days.


347
00:43:22.156 --> 00:43:23.224
Is that a marine plaque?

348
00:43:25.459 --> 00:43:26.827
Yeah...

349
00:43:29.997 --> 00:43:31.365
I joined,

350
00:43:31.398 --> 00:43:32.867
after my brother did.

351
00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:33.868
Derek's dad.

352
00:43:33.901 --> 00:43:35.369
Okay.

353
00:43:37.071 --> 00:43:38.772
- Where were ya?
- Iraq.


354
00:43:38.806 --> 00:43:40.542
Then Afghanistan.

355
00:43:40.575 --> 00:43:41.909
Oh, boy.

356
00:43:42.910 --> 00:43:43.944
Y'all right?

357
00:43:43.978 --> 00:43:46.213
Yeah.

358
00:43:46.247 --> 00:43:47.314
Ben was in Korea.

359
00:43:47.348 --> 00:43:49.316
Huh.

360
00:43:49.350 --> 00:43:50.951
Were you a doctor out there?

361
00:43:50.985 --> 00:43:52.319
Oh, no, no, no...

362
00:43:52.353 --> 00:43:54.355
That's...

363
00:43:54.388 --> 00:43:55.990
Where I thought
I might be a doctor.


364
00:43:56.023 --> 00:43:56.991
Yeah.

365
00:43:57.024 --> 00:43:58.527
Did something happen?

366
00:44:00.027 --> 00:44:02.597
Yeah, my buddy got shot up
pretty much.


367
00:44:04.599 --> 00:44:07.067
I had to haul him back
to his aid station.


368
00:44:07.101 --> 00:44:08.702
I put him over my shoulder...

369
00:44:10.104 --> 00:44:12.072
And got there
and there was no pulse...


370
00:44:12.106 --> 00:44:14.543
So the doctor did what he could.

371
00:44:16.243 --> 00:44:19.046
And I was there,
watching it all,


372
00:44:19.079 --> 00:44:20.848
and...

373
00:44:20.881 --> 00:44:23.984
He had to slice the side of him

374
00:44:24.018 --> 00:44:26.487
so he could reach inside.

375
00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:28.255
And he's telling me all this.

376
00:44:30.191 --> 00:44:32.259
He puts the heart in his hand.

377
00:44:32.293 --> 00:44:33.662
Inside.

378
00:44:33.694 --> 00:44:35.664
Starts squeezing it.

379
00:44:35.696 --> 00:44:38.399
He said,
"you kind of squeeze it...


380
00:44:38.432 --> 00:44:40.267
Like a new sponge."

381
00:44:40.301 --> 00:44:42.169
Squeeze it...

382
00:44:42.203 --> 00:44:43.504
Squeeze it...

383
00:44:43.538 --> 00:44:45.574
Not too hard...

384
00:44:45.607 --> 00:44:49.043
Squeeze it
so there's a rhythm to it.


385
00:44:51.580 --> 00:44:53.047
And...

386
00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:54.248
Suddenly, there's a pulse.

387
00:44:55.617 --> 00:44:56.850
Wow.

388
00:44:56.884 --> 00:45:00.054
And, uh...

389
00:45:00.087 --> 00:45:01.789
My buddy went home, got married,

390
00:45:01.822 --> 00:45:03.490
and had four kids.

391
00:45:05.726 --> 00:45:09.598
And I went to medical school,

392
00:45:09.631 --> 00:45:11.899
got married,

393
00:45:11.932 --> 00:45:13.602
and I have a beautiful daughter.

394
00:45:36.090 --> 00:45:37.626
<i>I'm takin' your gun.</i>

395
00:45:57.646 --> 00:46:00.514
What are you doing here, Ben?

396
00:46:00.548 --> 00:46:02.016
What do you mean?

397
00:46:03.450 --> 00:46:05.853
I mean, your car breaks down,
and you just abandon it.


398
00:46:09.557 --> 00:46:10.858
Yeah?

399
00:46:10.891 --> 00:46:13.260
I feel like you would've
gotten your car fixed


400
00:46:13.294 --> 00:46:15.630
and maybe even
come back to Seattle.


401
00:46:17.498 --> 00:46:18.700
But you didn't.

402
00:46:18.733 --> 00:46:19.900
You kept going.

403
00:46:21.969 --> 00:46:23.889
This trip must have been
really important to you.


404
00:46:29.376 --> 00:46:30.578
I have cancer.

405
00:46:36.817 --> 00:46:38.018
Have you told your family?

406
00:46:41.690 --> 00:46:44.058
My wife died a year ago.

407
00:46:46.827 --> 00:46:48.028
What about your daughter?

408
00:46:54.034 --> 00:46:55.670
She's going to find out
eventually.


409
00:46:59.073 --> 00:47:00.341
I know.

410
00:47:03.944 --> 00:47:05.446
You don't know
what's going to happen.


411
00:47:06.781 --> 00:47:08.248
But I do.

412
00:47:09.784 --> 00:47:11.686
I know exactly
what's going to happen.


413
00:47:13.387 --> 00:47:14.723
Bedsores and bone fractures,

414
00:47:14.756 --> 00:47:17.491
bacterial infection,
fluid in my lungs,


415
00:47:17.525 --> 00:47:18.526
vomiting,

416
00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:19.527
dehydration,

417
00:47:19.561 --> 00:47:20.928
cracked lips,

418
00:47:20.961 --> 00:47:22.831
dry mouth, pneumonia,

419
00:47:22.863 --> 00:47:25.199
the sensation
of being strangled at the end,


420
00:47:25.232 --> 00:47:26.376
and a final drip of morphine.

421
00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:27.635
That's what's going to happen.

422
00:47:30.538 --> 00:47:31.539
That's how it would end.

423
00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:34.609
If I let it.

424
00:48:24.592 --> 00:48:26.059
You miss your home at all?

425
00:48:26.093 --> 00:48:27.394
You know what I miss?

426
00:48:27.428 --> 00:48:29.597
Fireflies!

427
00:48:29.631 --> 00:48:31.298
- You ever see them?
- No.


428
00:48:32.867 --> 00:48:34.368
<i>They're magical.</i>

429
00:48:37.104 --> 00:48:39.707
<i>Come on! Let's go!
I wanna dance with you.</i>


430
00:48:40.775 --> 00:48:42.209
<i>Okay, okay, 
I'll dance.</i>

431
00:51:20.768 --> 00:51:22.770
Good morning, sunshine.

432
00:51:24.806 --> 00:51:26.708
Good morning!

433
00:51:29.209 --> 00:51:30.344
I'm sorry...

434
00:51:30.377 --> 00:51:33.146
I...

435
00:51:33.180 --> 00:51:34.582
I fell asleep on ya.

436
00:51:34.616 --> 00:51:36.116
Yeah, damn near mid-sentence.

437
00:51:37.284 --> 00:51:39.654
It's all good,
I didn't want to wake you up.


438
00:51:45.793 --> 00:51:47.795
Well, I made you some tea,

439
00:51:47.829 --> 00:51:49.697
I washed your shirts,

440
00:51:49.731 --> 00:51:51.633
and there is breakfast
in the kitchen,


441
00:51:51.666 --> 00:51:52.700
whenever you're ready.

442
00:51:52.734 --> 00:51:55.268
- Oh. Thank you.
- Yeah. No problem.


443
00:51:55.302 --> 00:51:57.939
Take your time.

444
00:51:57.972 --> 00:51:59.373
Okay.

445
00:52:08.683 --> 00:52:10.785
<i>All right, see ya.</i>

446
00:52:10.818 --> 00:52:12.720
Thank you for the ride.

447
00:52:12.754 --> 00:52:14.221
You betcha. See ya later.

448
00:52:14.254 --> 00:52:15.690
Okay.

449
00:54:03.664 --> 00:54:05.133
Huh.

450
00:54:31.526 --> 00:54:33.804
This paper has to come out
whether there's any news or not.


451
00:54:33.828 --> 00:54:34.868
You ever think about that?

452
00:54:36.964 --> 00:54:39.366
"Honoring barrows.

453
00:54:39.399 --> 00:54:42.469
Former mayor Clint barrows
receives plaque for service."


454
00:54:43.538 --> 00:54:44.539
Breaking news.

455
00:54:44.572 --> 00:54:47.340
Two months ago.
You sat in that same chair,


456
00:54:47.374 --> 00:54:49.442
pushed your beer aside,

457
00:54:49.476 --> 00:54:50.878
kindly said,

458
00:54:50.912 --> 00:54:52.280
"this paper has to come out

459
00:54:52.312 --> 00:54:54.115
whether there's any news
or not."


460
00:54:54.148 --> 00:54:55.550
And then you read the headlines.

461
00:54:57.484 --> 00:55:00.154
S'cuse me, gentlemen.

462
00:55:00.188 --> 00:55:01.799
You don't happen to know
anyone around here


463
00:55:01.823 --> 00:55:02.890
that handles coyotes.

464
00:55:02.924 --> 00:55:04.559
You got a problem with coyotes?

465
00:55:04.592 --> 00:55:08.963
Ah. You're looking for
a man named harden.


466
00:55:08.996 --> 00:55:10.140
What's his nephew's first name?

467
00:55:10.164 --> 00:55:11.132
Ethan.

468
00:55:11.165 --> 00:55:13.067
No, no. Ethan's his cousin.

469
00:55:13.100 --> 00:55:14.068
The nephew...

470
00:55:14.101 --> 00:55:15.069
Bill.

471
00:55:15.102 --> 00:55:17.738
Bill! Harden. Yeah.

472
00:55:17.772 --> 00:55:20.407
Lives up
on his uncle's orchards.


473
00:55:20.440 --> 00:55:22.977
He runs his dogs
down here sometimes.


474
00:55:23.010 --> 00:55:25.345
Hires 'em out to hunt coyotes.

475
00:55:26.681 --> 00:55:29.416
You know where I can locate
this bill harden?


476
00:55:29.449 --> 00:55:30.417
It's up near...

477
00:55:30.450 --> 00:55:32.352
I can't remember
the name of the orchard.


478
00:55:32.385 --> 00:55:33.353
It's got a funny name.

479
00:55:33.386 --> 00:55:35.488
Ah, they've all got funny names.

480
00:55:35.522 --> 00:55:38.358
Hey. Buddy.

481
00:55:38.391 --> 00:55:39.827
If you do find bill...

482
00:55:39.861 --> 00:55:41.329
Word of advice.

483
00:55:41.361 --> 00:55:42.495
He's different.

484
00:55:42.530 --> 00:55:44.431
Keep the talk on the coyotes,
you'll be fine.


485
00:55:44.464 --> 00:55:47.869
Thank you very much.
Appreciate that. Thank you.


486
00:56:00.982 --> 00:56:02.183
Hey, Ben.

487
00:56:02.216 --> 00:56:03.351
Anita is in with a patient.

488
00:56:03.383 --> 00:56:06.854
I just want to say hello to Rex,
see how he's doin'.


489
00:56:06.888 --> 00:56:08.289
That's cool.
You know where he is.


490
00:56:08.322 --> 00:56:09.824
Yeah. Thank you.

491
00:56:16.831 --> 00:56:18.232
Hey.

492
00:57:05.713 --> 00:57:06.814
I'm gonna write down

493
00:57:06.847 --> 00:57:07.958
my daughter Renee's
phone number.


494
00:57:07.982 --> 00:57:12.019
I want you to call her...
Have Anita call her...


495
00:57:12.053 --> 00:57:13.921
Ask her to come
and pick up the dog.


496
00:57:13.955 --> 00:57:14.956
Okay.

497
00:57:17.692 --> 00:57:18.693
Have a nice day.

498
00:58:24.859 --> 00:58:27.361
You are one ugly old man.

499
00:58:30.064 --> 00:58:31.465
Aidan.

500
00:59:22.116 --> 00:59:23.717
Nice place.

501
00:59:23.751 --> 00:59:25.519
If you say so.

502
00:59:28.756 --> 00:59:30.825
I was surprised
to get your call.


503
00:59:32.426 --> 00:59:34.428
Ben givens needs help.

504
00:59:35.463 --> 00:59:37.131
Wonders and miracles.

505
00:59:45.206 --> 00:59:46.807
How you doin', Aidan?

506
00:59:50.211 --> 00:59:51.946
I was sorry
to hear about Rachel.


507
00:59:54.715 --> 00:59:56.551
What's it been...
About a year now?


508
01:00:04.191 --> 01:00:06.794
What she ever saw in you.

509
01:00:08.496 --> 01:00:10.197
Wasted her good life.

510
01:00:11.732 --> 01:00:13.167
You think you made her happy?

511
01:00:15.035 --> 01:00:17.037
She didn't need me to be happy.

512
01:00:19.541 --> 01:00:20.774
How's Renee?

513
01:00:20.808 --> 01:00:23.377
I haven't seen her
since high school.


514
01:00:23.410 --> 01:00:25.646
And I hear she has a...

515
01:00:25.679 --> 01:00:26.814
A son?

516
01:00:26.847 --> 01:00:27.815
Chris.

517
01:00:27.848 --> 01:00:29.517
In college.

518
01:00:32.686 --> 01:00:33.654
Ah, right.

519
01:00:33.687 --> 01:00:37.191
I think I've asked
all the right questions.


520
01:00:39.059 --> 01:00:41.428
So why don't you just tell me...
What do you need?


521
01:00:43.330 --> 01:00:44.865
Well, I'm lookin' for
bill harden


522
01:00:44.899 --> 01:00:46.635
and I understand
he lives in the area.


523
01:00:46.667 --> 01:00:48.502
I know him.

524
01:00:48.537 --> 01:00:49.770
What do you want with him?

525
01:00:51.005 --> 01:00:52.339
Just want to meet him.

526
01:00:56.611 --> 01:00:58.188
Rachel sent me a letter
before she passed.


527
01:00:58.212 --> 01:01:00.748
Did she tell you?

528
01:01:00.781 --> 01:01:02.149
No.

529
01:01:02.183 --> 01:01:05.620
I think she knew pretty far out
that this was her time.


530
01:01:07.021 --> 01:01:09.056
She wanted me and you
to reconnect.


531
01:01:11.892 --> 01:01:13.894
I said I don't see
a reason for that.


532
01:01:16.030 --> 01:01:17.666
There was nothin' between us.

533
01:01:17.698 --> 01:01:19.233
We just lived different lives.

534
01:01:21.603 --> 01:01:24.004
I got another letter from her.

535
01:01:24.038 --> 01:01:25.540
Short time later.

536
01:01:30.044 --> 01:01:31.946
It was a one-word response.

537
01:01:35.716 --> 01:01:36.717
Horseshit.

538
01:01:39.386 --> 01:01:40.788
She could be a real smartass.

539
01:01:42.557 --> 01:01:43.558
Yeah.

540
01:01:54.134 --> 01:01:55.604
I'm gonna go see
about some lunch.


541
01:01:57.738 --> 01:01:59.907
After we eat, I'll take you
to see the old ranch.


542
01:02:12.286 --> 01:02:13.420
Did you get any birds?

543
01:02:14.922 --> 01:02:16.323
Yeah, I got a couple.

544
01:02:18.292 --> 01:02:19.594
Where's your dog?

545
01:02:19.628 --> 01:02:20.828
You got a dog?

546
01:02:20.861 --> 01:02:22.997
Mm. Yep.

547
01:02:23.030 --> 01:02:24.431
Where is he?

548
01:02:24.465 --> 01:02:25.600
He got tore up.

549
01:02:25.634 --> 01:02:26.967
He's with a vet.

550
01:02:27.001 --> 01:02:28.670
Uh-huh.

551
01:02:28.703 --> 01:02:30.804
I still do some huntin'
from time to time.


552
01:02:33.274 --> 01:02:34.241
When I'm in here,

553
01:02:34.275 --> 01:02:36.277
all I can think about
is being out there.


554
01:02:39.980 --> 01:02:42.684
But lately, when I'm out there,

555
01:02:42.717 --> 01:02:46.287
I keep thinking how nice it'd be
to be back in my chair.


556
01:02:47.955 --> 01:02:49.557
It's getting old, I think.

557
01:02:52.860 --> 01:02:54.461
You still have dad's gun?

558
01:02:55.796 --> 01:02:57.398
Why do you think
he gave it to you?


559
01:02:59.166 --> 01:03:00.200
I don't know.

560
01:03:00.234 --> 01:03:01.603
He must have wanted you
to have it.


561
01:03:01.636 --> 01:03:02.604
I mean he had a reason.

562
01:03:02.637 --> 01:03:03.605
I don't know.

563
01:03:03.638 --> 01:03:05.372
I... I...

564
01:03:05.406 --> 01:03:08.409
I just thought it should have
gone to me is all.


565
01:03:17.051 --> 01:03:18.052
You can't imagine

566
01:03:18.085 --> 01:03:20.321
what it was like
with dad at the end.


567
01:03:20.354 --> 01:03:21.623
I can imagine what it was like.

568
01:03:21.656 --> 01:03:23.257
No. You can't.

569
01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:28.095
He felt pushed out.

570
01:03:29.363 --> 01:03:30.931
Especially after
the cabin burned down.


571
01:03:35.670 --> 01:03:37.237
The night he died,

572
01:03:37.271 --> 01:03:39.641
I was holding his head
in my lap...


573
01:03:39.674 --> 01:03:42.577
Trying to calm him down some.

574
01:03:42.610 --> 01:03:45.145
He would sleep shaking,

575
01:03:45.179 --> 01:03:48.248
and then jerk awake in the dark,

576
01:03:48.282 --> 01:03:50.284
afraid that
he was going to slip away.


577
01:03:52.353 --> 01:03:53.854
Which he did a few hours later.

578
01:03:57.224 --> 01:04:01.663
I was with him
when he sold off the land,


579
01:04:01.696 --> 01:04:02.664
when he was sick.

580
01:04:02.697 --> 01:04:05.700
I made his meals,
I did his laundry.


581
01:04:05.734 --> 01:04:06.900
I did everything right.

582
01:04:09.036 --> 01:04:11.505
And when he was gone...

583
01:04:11.539 --> 01:04:13.541
What was left of me?

584
01:04:16.210 --> 01:04:19.012
I wasn't the kind of man
that any woman wanted anymore.


585
01:04:19.046 --> 01:04:22.015
What did you expect of me?

586
01:04:22.049 --> 01:04:23.585
I had a practice. I had Renee.

587
01:04:23.618 --> 01:04:24.619
I...

588
01:04:24.652 --> 01:04:27.521
Couldn't take care of him.

589
01:04:29.890 --> 01:04:30.859
You didn't even come back

590
01:04:30.891 --> 01:04:32.192
to help us
put him in the ground.


591
01:04:36.430 --> 01:04:38.232
I was there for him.

592
01:04:38.265 --> 01:04:39.734
You should have
been there for me.


593
01:04:43.237 --> 01:04:45.439
<i>Aidan givens. 
Leave a message.</i>

594
01:04:47.842 --> 01:04:49.109
<i>Hello, uncle Aidan.</i>

595
01:04:49.143 --> 01:04:50.411
<i>This is Renee.</i>

596
01:04:50.444 --> 01:04:51.579
<i>I'm Ben's daughter.</i>

597
01:04:51.613 --> 01:04:52.656
<i>I know we haven't seen
each other</i>


598
01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:53.715
<i>in a really long time,</i>

599
01:04:53.748 --> 01:04:55.215
<i>but I'm looking for my dad.</i>

600
01:04:55.249 --> 01:04:56.651
<i>He went hunting over there...</i>

601
01:04:56.684 --> 01:04:58.318
Are you going to get that?

602
01:04:58.352 --> 01:05:00.421
<i>If you hear from him,
if you see him...</i>


603
01:05:00.454 --> 01:05:02.322
I've lost my appetite. Let's go.

604
01:05:02.356 --> 01:05:03.490
<i>He had a car,</i>

605
01:05:03.525 --> 01:05:04.568
<i>it was found abandoned
on the old highway,</i>


606
01:05:04.592 --> 01:05:05.770
<i>and I'm very, very worried
about him.</i>


607
01:05:05.794 --> 01:05:07.461
<i>If you hear from him,
if you see him...</i>


608
01:06:36.083 --> 01:06:38.352
The new owners
tore down our old place


609
01:06:38.385 --> 01:06:40.354
and built a new one there.

610
01:06:42.055 --> 01:06:43.525
Not so new anymore.

611
01:06:50.632 --> 01:06:52.366
I have cancer.

612
01:06:53.868 --> 01:06:56.804
I've got a year
if I don't take treatment.


613
01:07:01.809 --> 01:07:03.945
Goddamn you.

614
01:07:03.978 --> 01:07:06.848
Sayin' something like that.

615
01:07:06.881 --> 01:07:08.248
Standing where we are.

616
01:07:09.951 --> 01:07:11.251
Would you even have called

617
01:07:11.285 --> 01:07:13.988
if you didn't need something
from me?


618
01:07:15.590 --> 01:07:17.124
No.

619
01:07:19.594 --> 01:07:21.563
But I'm...

620
01:07:21.596 --> 01:07:23.230
I'm glad I did.

621
01:07:23.263 --> 01:07:24.264
Really.

622
01:07:31.104 --> 01:07:33.240
What do you want from harden?

623
01:07:33.273 --> 01:07:35.475
It's a long story.

624
01:07:35.509 --> 01:07:37.053
It sure as hell
ain't gonna be a short one.


625
01:07:37.077 --> 01:07:42.817
I mean, you out here
with no wheels, no dog...


626
01:07:42.850 --> 01:07:44.084
Dyin' from cancer...

627
01:07:54.028 --> 01:07:55.462
Harden's place is near here.

628
01:07:58.967 --> 01:08:00.602
Old palisades road.

629
01:08:04.204 --> 01:08:05.840
North star ranch.

630
01:08:27.127 --> 01:08:29.162
You want me to go with you?

631
01:08:29.196 --> 01:08:31.666
No. I'll go myself.

632
01:08:34.836 --> 01:08:36.203
This is it?

633
01:08:39.373 --> 01:08:40.908
This is it.

634
01:08:43.745 --> 01:08:44.979
Okay.

635
01:08:50.585 --> 01:08:52.086
Thanks.

636
01:09:23.851 --> 01:09:25.653
<i>Ben,</i>

637
01:09:25.687 --> 01:09:28.056
<i>do you understand
that I'm leaving?</i>


638
01:09:30.024 --> 01:09:32.093
<i>It shouldn't be a surprise.</i>

639
01:09:32.126 --> 01:09:33.961
<i>It's always been my plan.</i>

640
01:09:36.698 --> 01:09:39.100
<i>Somehow, I thought
maybe you had a plan, too.</i>


641
01:09:42.937 --> 01:09:45.039
I guess I did.

642
01:09:46.373 --> 01:09:48.643
But it wasn't this.

643
01:10:18.472 --> 01:10:19.540
Think about

644
01:10:19.574 --> 01:10:20.784
what you want
from your life, Ben,


645
01:10:20.808 --> 01:10:22.509
and when you've done that,
let me know.


646
01:11:05.019 --> 01:11:06.020
Bill harden!

647
01:11:09.991 --> 01:11:11.692
What the hell
are you doin' here?


648
01:11:12.860 --> 01:11:13.995
I came to get my gun.

649
01:11:14.028 --> 01:11:15.271
It ain't yours no more, old man.

650
01:11:15.295 --> 01:11:19.499
The gun has been with my family
for a long time.


651
01:11:19.534 --> 01:11:21.936
It's not done yet.
And I'm not done with it.


652
01:11:21.969 --> 01:11:22.937
You better get the hell
out of here


653
01:11:22.970 --> 01:11:24.539
before I lose my temper.

654
01:11:25.706 --> 01:11:27.975
Do somethin' I'm gonna
have to explain to the sheriff.


655
01:11:28.009 --> 01:11:29.309
Not without the gun.

656
01:11:30.845 --> 01:11:32.246
You're tresspassin'.

657
01:11:36.316 --> 01:11:37.752
Go ahead, do it. Shoot.

658
01:11:42.355 --> 01:11:43.356
Do it.

659
01:11:47.195 --> 01:11:48.835
Goddamnit, shoot.
Go on, do it, damn it...


660
01:11:48.863 --> 01:11:50.164
Get your goddamned hands off!

661
01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:53.734
You crazy, stupid
son of a bitch.


662
01:12:17.357 --> 01:12:19.093
I see you again,

663
01:12:19.126 --> 01:12:22.029
I'm going to hurt you
before I kill you.


664
01:13:39.707 --> 01:13:40.741
<i>Ben.</i>

665
01:13:40.775 --> 01:13:42.610
Come on.

666
01:13:44.812 --> 01:13:45.846
Come on.

667
01:14:11.906 --> 01:14:14.075
Do it, Ben.

668
01:16:11.959 --> 01:16:13.227
I came to get my dog.

669
01:16:13.260 --> 01:16:15.329
Would you be so kind
as to open your clinic?


670
01:16:16.531 --> 01:16:17.932
Of co... Get in here!

671
01:16:17.965 --> 01:16:20.801
God, you have no idea
how happy I am to see you.


672
01:16:21.936 --> 01:16:23.404
So that number
that you gave me...


673
01:16:23.437 --> 01:16:24.505
I hope you don't mind,

674
01:16:24.539 --> 01:16:26.541
but I went ahead
and I called it.


675
01:16:30.010 --> 01:16:30.978
Renee.

676
01:16:31.011 --> 01:16:32.012
Dad.

677
01:16:34.982 --> 01:16:36.317
Oh, my god.

678
01:16:37.318 --> 01:16:39.353
- I was so worried about you.
- Oh, my. Oh, my.


679
01:16:41.822 --> 01:16:43.757
Oh, I'm so glad to see you.

680
01:16:43.791 --> 01:16:45.659
I'm so glad you're here.

681
01:16:47.328 --> 01:16:49.330
Dad. They said
that Rex got hurt?


682
01:16:49.363 --> 01:16:50.431
Did you get hurt?

683
01:16:50.464 --> 01:16:52.399
Rex is fine, I'm fine.

684
01:16:53.901 --> 01:16:55.269
I love you so much.

685
01:16:55.302 --> 01:16:57.204
I'm so happy that you're back.

686
01:16:58.540 --> 01:16:59.874
I'm so sorry.

687
01:16:59.907 --> 01:17:01.075
It's okay.

688
01:17:02.810 --> 01:17:04.345
It's okay.

689
01:17:22.363 --> 01:17:23.565
That's a good boy.

690
01:17:34.275 --> 01:17:35.276
Doin' okay?
