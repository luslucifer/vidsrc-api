Hello?

[urgent knocking]

11
00:01:13.937 --> 00:01:17.475
Sir, if you can hear me
I need you to acknowledge.


12
00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:20.411
Shit!

13

[dramatic crescendo]

15
00:01:35.892 --> 00:01:37.726
I'm gonna put him in
something warmer.


16
00:01:37.728 --> 00:01:39.393
I feel like he's got
a cold coming on.


17
00:01:39.395 --> 00:01:41.363
Yeah. Good idea.

18
00:01:41.365 --> 00:01:43.765
I put the heater on
so it should warm up.


19
00:01:43.767 --> 00:01:45.399
And I also plugged up
those holes


20
00:01:45.401 --> 00:01:46.403
that were letting in
the drafts.


21
00:01:50.474 --> 00:01:52.377
Well he's outgrown this one too.

22
00:01:54.278 --> 00:01:56.544
Aww, that one was cool.

23
00:01:56.546 --> 00:01:57.845
You liked that?

24
00:01:57.847 --> 00:01:58.881
Yeah!

25
00:01:58.883 --> 00:02:00.318
Who got it for us?

26
00:02:01.218 --> 00:02:02.717
Your boss I think.

27
00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:04.520
Huh.

28
00:02:04.522 --> 00:02:07.389
We should probably donate this
stuff to charity, though.


29
00:02:07.391 --> 00:02:09.892
Or-or-wait. Who do we
know that's expecting?


30
00:02:09.894 --> 00:02:11.894
You want to give it away?

31
00:02:11.896 --> 00:02:13.829
Let's just pack it for now.

32
00:02:13.831 --> 00:02:15.197
I mean what if we
have another one?


33
00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:16.465
Pfft.

34
00:02:16.467 --> 00:02:19.303
Well... let's just...
see how it goes.


35
00:02:28.245 --> 00:02:29.279
Is he asleep?

36
00:02:30.247 --> 00:02:31.783
I think so.

37
00:02:33.651 --> 00:02:35.253
Wanna take him to the crib?

38
00:02:36.587 --> 00:02:39.588
No, I'm gonna wait a
little bit longer.


39
00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.793
Make sure he's totally out.

40
00:02:44.228 --> 00:02:45.594
Well, hey...

41
00:02:45.596 --> 00:02:48.297
Why don't I hold
him, and you can...


42
00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:50.499
take that bath you didn't
get around to earlier.


43
00:02:50.501 --> 00:02:52.967
Just... relax a little.

44
00:02:52.969 --> 00:02:54.902
- Really?
- Yeah.


45
00:02:54.904 --> 00:02:56.338
Yeah, I'll just...

46
00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.176
watch something out here
for a while.


47
00:02:59.242 --> 00:03:00.608
Oh, but quietly!

48
00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.346
I will put captions on.

49
00:03:03.847 --> 00:03:06.315
OK. If you're sure.

50
00:03:06.317 --> 00:03:07.184
Yeah.

51
00:03:26.236 --> 00:03:28.669
He's probably gonna wake
up the second I dip a toe in.


52
00:03:28.671 --> 00:03:30.174
I can handle it.

53
00:03:31.307 --> 00:03:34.008
No... you can come get me.

54
00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.380
It's just the way
he's been lately.


55
00:03:38.616 --> 00:03:39.982
Anyway I won't be long.

56
00:03:39.984 --> 00:03:41.682
Take your time.

57
00:03:41.684 --> 00:03:42.553
Thanks!

[water shuts off]

61
00:04:21.791 --> 00:04:23.325
There's no hot water.

62
00:04:23.327 --> 00:04:25.861
It's barely even lukewarm.

63
00:04:25.863 --> 00:04:28.297
[sigh]
Not again.


64
00:04:28.299 --> 00:04:30.431
Do we have to call
that guy back again?


65
00:04:30.433 --> 00:04:31.467
No. No.

66
00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:34.035
I saw what he did when he
was here last time.


67
00:04:34.037 --> 00:04:35.936
It's basically just
like cleaning a mesh.


68
00:04:35.938 --> 00:04:37.739
I'm pretty sure I can do it.

69
00:04:37.741 --> 00:04:38.773
Oh OK, good.

70
00:04:38.775 --> 00:04:40.877
I really didn't like him.
He gave me the creeps!


71
00:04:41.945 --> 00:04:42.747
[chuckle]
Yeah.


72
00:04:45.982 --> 00:04:49.016
[sigh]
Well, another raincheck I guess.


73
00:04:49.018 --> 00:04:49.953
Sorry.

74
00:04:51.322 --> 00:04:52.153
Are you gonna fix it?

75
00:04:52.155 --> 00:04:53.757
Yeah.
First thing in the morning.


76
00:04:55.392 --> 00:04:56.857
All right.

77
00:04:56.859 --> 00:04:57.861
Let's just go to bed.

78
00:05:14.611 --> 00:05:15.747
[bump]
Ah! Goddam...


79
00:05:33.597 --> 00:05:34.599
Sorry!

80
00:05:35.631 --> 00:05:37.366
You've got to be more careful.

81
00:05:37.368 --> 00:05:38.600
You almost woke him up again!

82
00:05:38.602 --> 00:05:40.135
I know. I know.

83
00:05:40.137 --> 00:05:42.970
It's too dark.
I can't see anything.


84
00:05:42.972 --> 00:05:45.474
Well that's why we
have a nightlight.


85
00:05:45.476 --> 00:05:48.008
It's a <i>nightlight.</i>
Still can't see anything.


86
00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:50.445
Takes a while for
your eyes to adjust.


87
00:05:50.447 --> 00:05:51.912
Am I supposed to,
like, stand in the corner


88
00:05:51.914 --> 00:05:54.148
over by the door in the dark
for, like, five minutes?


89
00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:55.652
Yeah! Maybe you should!

90
00:05:57.488 --> 00:05:58.323
No.

91
00:06:08.998 --> 00:06:12.669
[sigh] Maybe it's time to move
the crib into the nursery.


92
00:06:13.871 --> 00:06:16.504
Yes! Yes.

93
00:06:16.506 --> 00:06:18.874
I've been saying that for weeks.

94
00:06:18.876 --> 00:06:22.943
We can finally walk around here
without having to tiptoe everywhere.


95
00:06:22.945 --> 00:06:25.547
Or flip on a light switch
every once in a while.


96
00:06:25.549 --> 00:06:27.782
Watch TV in the next room

97
00:06:27.784 --> 00:06:30.951
without having to worry
about gunshots or explosions...


98
00:06:30.953 --> 00:06:31.722
And...

99
00:06:33.724 --> 00:06:37.491
probably all sorts of other advantages
that I can't think of right now...


100
00:06:37.493 --> 00:06:39.861
[giggles]

101
00:06:39.863 --> 00:06:43.067
OK, well you can move
the crib over tomorrow.


102
00:06:45.202 --> 00:06:47.572
- Goodnight!
- Gooodnight!


103

[baby crying]

104
00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:16.465
It's cold this morning, huh?

105
00:07:16.467 --> 00:07:20.570
Yeah. I think winter is
well and truly here now.


106
00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:25.674
Cereal?

107
00:07:25.676 --> 00:07:26.777
Uh... Yes, please.

108
00:07:34.618 --> 00:07:36.551
Oh, you know what?
Don't make me any coffee.


109
00:07:36.553 --> 00:07:37.686
No?

110
00:07:37.688 --> 00:07:41.256
No, I think I'm gonna skip the
caffeine this morning.


111
00:07:41.258 --> 00:07:42.359
Gonna try and take a nap.

112
00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:47.498
Yeah he did <i>not</i> take it
easy on us last night.


113
00:07:53.669 --> 00:07:54.604
What about you?

114
00:07:56.573 --> 00:07:58.205
What <i>about</i> me?

115
00:07:58.207 --> 00:07:59.743
What are <i>you</i> up to
this morning?


116
00:08:01.577 --> 00:08:04.614
Uhhh... I am moving the
crib... is what I'm doing.

[clearing throat]

118
00:08:08.618 --> 00:08:10.621
Aren't you forgetting something?

119
00:08:14.123 --> 00:08:18.662
I... am fixing the water heater
and then I am moving the crib.


120
00:08:28.804 --> 00:08:33.543
Shhhh. Shhhh.

[baby crying]

123
00:08:54.163 --> 00:08:57.299
You've been saying you're gonna replace
those old things since we bought the place!


124
00:08:57.301 --> 00:08:59.199
I know! I was... I
am... I-I just...

[alarm stops abruptly]

126
00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:03.270
Didn't get around to it.

127
00:09:03.272 --> 00:09:05.542
Great. Back to square one.

128
00:09:06.576 --> 00:09:07.611
[baby crying]

129
00:09:28.364 --> 00:09:31.635
Almost time to wave 'bye' to
our little roommate.


130
00:09:33.369 --> 00:09:35.205
Oh you know I have laundry
in there, right?


131
00:09:36.172 --> 00:09:39.009
Really?
Can you move it, please?


132
00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:42.013
Ahhh. OK.

[sighs]

136
00:09:47.383 --> 00:09:49.751
It's... it's not gonna
fit through the door.


137
00:09:49.753 --> 00:09:51.653
I'm gonna have to take it apart.

138
00:09:51.655 --> 00:09:53.224
[gentle sombre music]

139
00:10:04.734 --> 00:10:06.103
OK - room's all clear.

140
00:10:20.416 --> 00:10:22.916
Hey did you lock this again?

141
00:10:22.918 --> 00:10:23.785
<i>No.</i>

142
00:10:23.787 --> 00:10:24.921
Well it's locked.

143
00:10:26.056 --> 00:10:28.390
<i>Sorry, I didn't mean to.</i>

144
00:10:28.392 --> 00:10:30.791
(sighs) Can you get me
one of those spiky things?


145
00:10:30.793 --> 00:10:31.962
So I can unlock it.

146
00:10:36.365 --> 00:10:38.400
Why do you keep doing this?

147
00:10:38.402 --> 00:10:39.733
<i>I said I didn't mean to.</i>

148
00:10:39.735 --> 00:10:40.834
<i>It's the little button thing.</i>

<i>Sometimes it gets
pressed by mistake.</i>


150
00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:46.073
Here.

151
00:10:46.075 --> 00:10:47.375
Thank you.

00:10:47.377 --> 00:10:48.012

[lock clicks]

154
00:10:53.816 --> 00:10:55.717
Do you need this, right now?

155
00:10:55.719 --> 00:10:57.017
No.

156
00:10:57.019 --> 00:11:01.423
OK. Then I'm gonna
put this right...


157
00:11:01.425 --> 00:11:04.128
Uh... I'm gonna put
this right here...


158
00:11:05.128 --> 00:11:06.794
For next time.

159
00:11:06.796 --> 00:11:09.798
I've literally only
done it two times.


160
00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:11.299
Three. Now.

161
00:11:11.301 --> 00:11:14.104
Which makes three to zero.

162
00:11:15.104 --> 00:11:16.106
OK. Stop.

163
00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:32.786
Are we gonna put the
TV back up there?


164
00:11:32.788 --> 00:11:34.456
Uh... yeah eventually.

165
00:11:34.458 --> 00:11:36.458
Just let me deal
with this first.

Yeah, take a look.

00:12:23.038 --> 00:12:24.872
It's a pretty good picture.

178
00:12:24.874 --> 00:12:27.007
I'm happy with that.

179
00:12:27.009 --> 00:12:28.242
Have to see how it
works at night.

we'll be using that feature.

Ah! Nice.

It even tells us what
the temperature is in there.


187
00:12:43.325 --> 00:12:44.892
That could be useful.

Yeah...

189
00:12:46.796 --> 00:12:48.896

190
00:12:48.898 --> 00:12:49.997
Is that a bit low?

191
00:12:49.999 --> 00:12:51.868
I should check. See...

192
00:12:59.875 --> 00:13:01.211
They say it should be...

193
00:13:02.579 --> 00:13:04.411
68 degrees.

194
00:13:04.413 --> 00:13:05.782

I should have the hang
of it by now, but I just

00:14:32.902 --> 00:14:36.005
I feel like I'm slipping
further underwater every day.


213
00:14:39.942 --> 00:14:42.543
I just feel exhausted
all the time.

I mean... <i>all</i> the time!

216
00:14:47.216 --> 00:14:49.052
No, look. I know.

217
00:14:50.119 --> 00:14:51.855
I'm feeling drained too.

218
00:14:53.389 --> 00:14:55.925
I think that's
just... what it is.


219
00:14:59.362 --> 00:15:00.998
Are we bad parents?

220
00:15:02.565 --> 00:15:04.935
I think it's too early to tell!

221
00:15:05.701 --> 00:15:10.038
I think we probably have to wait
another 10 or 15 years, and...


222
00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:12.506
we can check his grades and

administer a drug test.

00:15:15.311 --> 00:15:17.013
That sort of thing.

00:15:18.348 --> 00:15:20.014
But this?

226
00:15:20.016 --> 00:15:21.418
This is temporary.

227
00:15:22.518 --> 00:15:24.419
And we'll get through it.

228
00:15:24.421 --> 00:15:26.654
Of course we will.

229
00:15:26.656 --> 00:15:30.294
I mean... no one ever said
it was gonna be easy, right?


230
00:15:32.061 --> 00:15:35.032
I had no idea it was
gonna be this hard.


231
00:15:36.966 --> 00:15:37.967
Yeah.

232
00:15:39.502 --> 00:15:41.671
It's been harder
than I expected too.


233
00:15:43.706 --> 00:15:45.973
And lately it...

234
00:15:45.975 --> 00:15:49.078
feels like it's been
getting harder, not easier.


235
00:15:54.750 --> 00:15:58.086
It's crazy.
It's really crazy, isn't it?


236
00:15:58.088 --> 00:15:59.754
How this...

237
00:15:59.756 --> 00:16:02.293
This is <i>humanity.</i>

238
00:16:03.593 --> 00:16:05.226
I mean...

All of humankind,
all the way back...


240
00:16:09.465 --> 00:16:13.367
doesn't matter who you
were - rich or poor...


241
00:16:13.369 --> 00:16:15.703
we all started out
just like this.

In constant need of attention...

243
00:16:19.109 --> 00:16:20.775
just to stay alive.

244
00:16:20.777 --> 00:16:23.144
And all their parents
struggled with the


245
00:16:23.146 --> 00:16:26.079
exact same issues, and

246
00:16:26.081 --> 00:16:28.085
reveled in the
same joys, like...


247
00:16:29.085 --> 00:16:30.650
the first smile...

248
00:16:30.652 --> 00:16:34.488
But, the one thing that they
all have in common.

All of my ancestors.

Otherwise we wouldn't be here.

00:16:47.737 --> 00:16:52.343

manage then so can we.

Yeah. It was good.

00:19:18.388 --> 00:19:19.490
I guess I needed that.

271
00:19:22.192 --> 00:19:24.658
I think I must have drifted
off while I was in there though.

- I'm not judging.

Yeah maybe... But not tonight.

I don't feel like starting a
whole thing like that right now.

a bit early, but...

Yeah, I had it a couple
of times lately.

Let's see how you like
it in your new room.

I'm just gonna set it up on
your side, if that's OK.

00:22:35.917 --> 00:22:36.953
I guess.

308
00:22:38.654 --> 00:22:41.558
I mean, I will get up too
if you need. I just, um...


309
00:22:42.925 --> 00:22:46.493
I need to do some work tomorrow.
To get ready for the trip.


310
00:22:46.495 --> 00:22:49.463
And I know I still have
a few days, but...


311
00:22:49.465 --> 00:22:51.999
I'm really hoping to make
a dent in it tomorrow.

Well, I'll try and let
you sleep if I can.


313
00:22:55.838 --> 00:22:56.639
Thank you.

314
00:23:06.882 --> 00:23:08.017
Actually, about the trip.

315
00:23:09.151 --> 00:23:09.952
What?

316
00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:13.887
Do you <i>really</i> have to go?

317
00:23:13.889 --> 00:23:16.690
Come on. We have
talked about this already.


318
00:23:16.692 --> 00:23:18.929
I know, and I get that
it's important but...


319
00:23:19.829 --> 00:23:23.532
It's just things are different now
than when we first talked about them.

I don't know why it's
so difficult for me


322
00:23:28.170 --> 00:23:29.569
but it just is.

323
00:23:29.571 --> 00:23:33.072
OK look. If I can get
things done quicker


324
00:23:33.074 --> 00:23:35.611
I will be on the first
flight back here.


325
00:23:37.013 --> 00:23:38.915
But I <i>do</i> have to go.

326
00:23:39.916 --> 00:23:41.214
You think there's any way

327
00:23:41.216 --> 00:23:42.982
that they would let me take
this much time off


328
00:23:42.984 --> 00:23:44.551
if there was any chance

329
00:23:44.553 --> 00:23:46.220

813
00:58:24.698 --> 00:58:26.667
Oh my god, are you OK?

814
00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:29.503
Please say something!

815
00:58:34.874 --> 00:58:37.142
Did you see where he went?

816
00:58:37.144 --> 00:58:39.714
No. Wha-what, the man
you-that you saw outside?


817
00:58:41.582 --> 00:58:43.017
Can you get him?

818
00:58:58.198 --> 00:59:00.165
Here, come... here, go.

819
00:59:00.167 --> 00:59:00.969
Wait!

820
00:59:02.169 --> 00:59:04.138
OK. Go!

821
00:59:06.673 --> 00:59:09.878
Ready? You go in
there. Stay there.


822
00:59:11.946 --> 00:59:13.181
Call the cops!

823
00:59:17.850 --> 00:59:20.651
Oh thank god, I need the police.

824
00:59:20.653 --> 00:59:22.222
Yes, it's an emergency.

825
00:59:23.657 --> 00:59:25.660
[baby crying]
- There's someone in the house.


826
00:59:47.914 --> 00:59:48.682
[tense music]

827
00:59:53.854 --> 00:59:55.056
- [sigh]
- Nothing.


828
00:59:56.923 --> 00:59:59.057
Did you call the police?

829
00:59:59.059 --> 01:00:00.562
Yeah, they're on their way.

830
01:00:01.361 --> 01:00:02.162
OK.

831
01:00:03.396 --> 01:00:06.700
Maybe they can help shed some
light on this because, uh...


832
01:00:10.169 --> 01:00:11.905
Can you put his jacket on?

833
01:00:13.073 --> 01:00:14.908
We should go wait
for them in there.


834
01:00:15.876 --> 01:00:17.174
So this means it's all real.

835
01:00:17.176 --> 01:00:18.245
Someone was in the house.

836
01:00:19.213 --> 01:00:20.013
I don't know.

837
01:00:21.414 --> 01:00:23.817
What do you mean you don't
know? Look at your head!


838
01:00:25.118 --> 01:00:27.752
Oh my god, someone was in the
house all these times.


839
01:00:27.754 --> 01:00:29.187
I feel sick to my stomach.

840
01:00:29.189 --> 01:00:31.423
I don't know what happened.

841
01:00:31.425 --> 01:00:33.193
It's like I blacked out.

842
01:00:34.727 --> 01:00:36.060
Nobody's here now.

843
01:00:36.062 --> 01:00:37.963
What if... they're still here

844
01:00:37.965 --> 01:00:40.098
and they slipped behind your
back when you weren't looking?


845
01:00:40.100 --> 01:00:43.702
No, no. Stop. You're just
scaring yourself.


846
01:00:43.704 --> 01:00:44.836
I'm scaring <i>myself?</i>

847
01:00:44.838 --> 01:00:47.975
No, this whole thing is doing a
pretty good job of that.


848
01:00:49.042 --> 01:00:52.109
Occam's razor: the simplest
explanation is the right one.


849
01:00:52.111 --> 01:00:55.682
I just don't have any
explanation for any of this.


850
01:00:57.785 --> 01:01:00.788
I don't see how anyone
could be in here.


851
01:01:01.722 --> 01:01:04.222
I know this is gonna sound
nuts, I realize that but


852
01:01:04.224 --> 01:01:07.258
what if... what if
there's something...


853
01:01:07.260 --> 01:01:08.794
[banging at the door]

854
01:01:08.796 --> 01:01:10.227
<i>Police department!</i>

855
01:01:10.229 --> 01:01:13.635
<i>Open up! We have a
report of a disturbance.</i>


856
01:01:14.434 --> 01:01:16.068
Whoa... Whoa officer!

857
01:01:16.070 --> 01:01:17.803
- Are you the homeowner?
- Yes! Yes!


858
01:01:17.805 --> 01:01:20.004
Ma'am? Are you the one
that called 9-1-1?


859
01:01:20.006 --> 01:01:20.805
Yes!

860
01:01:20.807 --> 01:01:22.339
OK and is this man
bothering you?


861
01:01:22.341 --> 01:01:23.607
No, no that's my husband.

862
01:01:23.609 --> 01:01:26.444
- All right sir, I'm gonna need to cuff you up.
- What?! Why?


863
01:01:26.446 --> 01:01:28.747
- It's just a precaution.
- That's not necessary!


864
01:01:28.749 --> 01:01:29.884
He's not the intruder!

865
01:01:32.486 --> 01:01:34.151
All right, we're
gonna find out.


866
01:01:34.153 --> 01:01:35.722
You just stay right here.

867
01:01:37.925 --> 01:01:38.859
Don't move!

868
01:01:46.033 --> 01:01:48.002
<i>All right, ma'am. You can
go ahead and speak freely.</i>


869
01:01:49.202 --> 01:01:51.435
Is your husband the
reason why you called?


870
01:01:51.437 --> 01:01:54.372
No, I said 'no' - why
is he handcuffed?


871
01:01:54.374 --> 01:01:56.040
Look, there was
someone in our house.


872
01:01:56.042 --> 01:01:59.010
He was in our
baby's room before.


873
01:01:59.012 --> 01:02:02.984
OK, so you believe that there is
an intruder still in the house?


874
01:02:04.117 --> 01:02:05.816
I don't... I don't know...

875
01:02:05.818 --> 01:02:09.053
No. We-we don't think so. My
husband looked around.


876
01:02:09.055 --> 01:02:10.888
[ominous music]

877
01:02:10.890 --> 01:02:11.992
Oh god.

878
01:02:13.459 --> 01:02:14.394
Stay here.

879
01:02:25.905 --> 01:02:26.840
Anything?

880
01:02:27.541 --> 01:02:29.508
Nothing outside.

881
01:02:29.510 --> 01:02:32.042
- You checked all the way around?
- Yeah.


882
01:02:32.044 --> 01:02:34.011
- Both sides?
- Yeah!


883
01:02:34.013 --> 01:02:34.948
All right.

884
01:02:37.251 --> 01:02:38.019
[sighs]

885
01:02:47.126 --> 01:02:48.862
Sir, you can come back inside.
C'mon.


886
01:02:51.365 --> 01:02:52.166
Turn around.

887
01:02:57.070 --> 01:02:59.104
Ma'am, I'm gonna need you to stay
right here with your husband.


888
01:02:59.106 --> 01:03:00.341
We're gonna check it out.

889
01:03:04.544 --> 01:03:09.050
[whispering]

890
01:03:14.488 --> 01:03:17.555
All right, so here's the deal
we... searched the entire house.


891
01:03:17.557 --> 01:03:18.957
The intruder's not here.

892
01:03:18.959 --> 01:03:21.959
Why don't you folks
tell me what you saw?


893
01:03:21.961 --> 01:03:25.897
Well, uhm... it started
a few nights ago.


894
01:03:25.899 --> 01:03:28.432
We thought we saw
someone in the baby's room.


895
01:03:28.434 --> 01:03:29.536
You saw someone?

896
01:03:30.937 --> 01:03:33.037
Ah well not <i>directly,</i> uhm...

897
01:03:33.039 --> 01:03:36.207
We saw him on the baby monitor.

898
01:03:36.209 --> 01:03:36.977
Mm-hmm...

899
01:03:37.945 --> 01:03:40.312
Why didn't you report
this to the police?


900
01:03:40.314 --> 01:03:44.986
Well actually we... we just thought
something was up with the monitor.


901
01:03:47.254 --> 01:03:48.256
And then?

902
01:03:50.224 --> 01:03:51.589
Umm... tonight

903
01:03:51.591 --> 01:03:52.557
I heard something

904
01:03:52.559 --> 01:03:55.593
and so I came out of
our bedroom, right there


905
01:03:55.595 --> 01:03:59.064
into the hallway and...

906
01:03:59.066 --> 01:04:04.002
I saw him with my own
eyes, standing right there


907
01:04:04.004 --> 01:04:05.540
just staring at me.

908
01:04:06.506 --> 01:04:07.939
What did you... what did you do?

909
01:04:07.941 --> 01:04:11.075
I... uh... ran at him
with a golf club.


910
01:04:11.077 --> 01:04:12.280
You <i>attacked</i> him?

911
01:04:13.914 --> 01:04:15.446
I was tired... it was...

912
01:04:15.448 --> 01:04:17.982
Everything is all...
is very blurry.


913
01:04:17.984 --> 01:04:20.021
I came out just a second later.

914
01:04:20.921 --> 01:04:23.020
And the intruder was gone, hmm?

915
01:04:23.022 --> 01:04:24.089
Yes.

916
01:04:24.091 --> 01:04:26.957
Well did you guys see
any open doors or windows?


917
01:04:26.959 --> 01:04:30.160
Or any sign that he escaped?

918
01:04:30.162 --> 01:04:34.068
It all happened in an instant.
I don't know where he went.


919
01:04:36.336 --> 01:04:39.006
OK, can you tell me what the
intruder looked like?


920
01:04:39.939 --> 01:04:43.008
I couldn't see his face....
he was wearing a mask.


921
01:04:43.010 --> 01:04:45.644
Umm... and it was
dark. But... um...


922
01:04:45.646 --> 01:04:48.914
It was almost like a
Halloween costume... um...


923
01:04:48.916 --> 01:04:52.450
One of those long... beak masks.

924
01:04:52.452 --> 01:04:54.486
A plague doctor!

925
01:04:54.488 --> 01:04:58.689
Yeah! Like a... a plague doctor.
Do you know what that is?


926
01:04:58.691 --> 01:05:00.493
Yeah, maybe. Clothing?

927
01:05:01.695 --> 01:05:05.196
Um. A long black gown...

928
01:05:05.198 --> 01:05:06.330
It was dark so... um...

929
01:05:06.332 --> 01:05:08.869
- Did you get a look at him?
- No.


930
01:05:09.568 --> 01:05:12.703
But I <i>know</i> he was there.
I saw him on the monitor.


931
01:05:12.705 --> 01:05:16.040
All right now I...
I have to ask you this.


932
01:05:16.042 --> 01:05:17.709
Have you two been drinking?

933
01:05:17.711 --> 01:05:20.979
Or how about doing
any... recreational drugs?


934
01:05:20.981 --> 01:05:22.680
No! No.

935
01:05:22.682 --> 01:05:25.716
Um, we just had a glass of wine

936
01:05:25.718 --> 01:05:29.019
while watching a movie
tonight, that's it.


937
01:05:29.021 --> 01:05:30.254
'Cause I have to let you know,

938
01:05:30.256 --> 01:05:33.258
the pair of you are slurring
your words just a little bit.


939
01:05:33.260 --> 01:05:36.361
No! Look. There
really was someone...


940
01:05:36.363 --> 01:05:39.064
Or... or something...

941
01:05:39.066 --> 01:05:39.897
OK.

942
01:05:39.899 --> 01:05:41.031
Listen, why don't you go
call this in.


943
01:05:41.033 --> 01:05:42.667
I'll wrap it up here.

944
01:05:42.669 --> 01:05:44.071
Ahh... yeah.

945
01:05:53.412 --> 01:05:55.379
I mean, there's no
evidence of a break-in


946
01:05:55.381 --> 01:05:57.182
and there's no one here now.

947
01:05:57.184 --> 01:05:58.716
You don't believe us.

948
01:05:58.718 --> 01:06:03.187
<i>I</i> believe that <i>you</i>
believe, you saw someone.


949
01:06:03.189 --> 01:06:04.157
OK?

950
01:06:05.459 --> 01:06:08.258
But let me tell you what I
<i>really</i> think is going on here.


951
01:06:08.260 --> 01:06:09.760
You folks have a new baby.

952
01:06:09.762 --> 01:06:13.131
Your sleep is disrupted. It's a
very anxious time for you.


953
01:06:13.133 --> 01:06:16.100
I mean, I just think things
have gotten on top of you.


954
01:06:16.102 --> 01:06:17.035
Look...

955
01:06:17.037 --> 01:06:18.435
You're shaken up.

956
01:06:18.437 --> 01:06:20.705
Listen - you're shaken up.

957
01:06:20.707 --> 01:06:23.107
You have a... bump on your head.

958
01:06:23.109 --> 01:06:25.412
I think both of you just
really need some rest.


959
01:06:26.713 --> 01:06:30.084
What if it's not... real

960
01:06:30.783 --> 01:06:34.618
as in, you know,
like... like, <i>real.</i>


961
01:06:34.620 --> 01:06:37.222
But what if it's
something unexplainable


962
01:06:37.224 --> 01:06:40.593
but that... we're
still in danger.


963
01:06:42.229 --> 01:06:45.796
I mean, do you folks have somebody
that you call to come stay with you?


964
01:06:45.798 --> 01:06:49.566
Or... somewhere that
<i>you</i> can go and stay?


965
01:06:49.568 --> 01:06:50.537
Right now?

966
01:06:51.805 --> 01:06:53.107
No, not really, no.

967
01:06:56.742 --> 01:06:58.044
All right, well I can...

968
01:06:59.412 --> 01:07:01.178
All right here's
what we're gonna do.


969
01:07:01.180 --> 01:07:04.385

worried and upset by this.

I will swing by...

I'll look around the property

OK, and that you're safe.

- But, uh, we gotta get going.

get some rest.

Close and lock all the windows
and doors, so you feel safe.

I mean, it was
standing right there!

him away, or...

01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:34.804
<i>Copy that.</i>

1132
01:18:34.806 --> 01:18:35.805
<i>Please secure the scene</i>

1133
01:18:35.807 --> 01:18:37.043
<i>and await their arrival.</i>

1134
01:18:48.488 --> 01:18:49.321
Finally...

1135
01:18:50.489 --> 01:18:52.024
Yeah, yeah.

1136
01:18:53.993 --> 01:18:55.526
The deceased?

1137
01:18:55.528 --> 01:18:57.731
Humm... right through there.

1138
01:18:59.865 --> 01:19:01.398
You know, why don't you
set up over there.


1139
01:19:01.400 --> 01:19:03.003
Just watch your step.

1140
01:19:04.870 --> 01:19:06.402
Hey, is the uh... coroner here?

1141
01:19:06.404 --> 01:19:08.340
Yeah. I just saw him
park outside.


1142
01:19:32.164 --> 01:19:33.798
Officer!

1143
01:19:33.800 --> 01:19:34.801
[clears throat]

1144
01:19:36.569 --> 01:19:38.102
So you're in charge?

1145
01:19:38.104 --> 01:19:41.005
Yeah I guess so.
I uh... called it in.


1146
01:19:41.007 --> 01:19:44.044
Sorry about the delay, we had
a messy one across town.


1147
01:19:45.077 --> 01:19:47.178
So you were first on the scene?

1148
01:19:47.180 --> 01:19:48.179
Yeah, that's right.

1149
01:19:48.181 --> 01:19:50.581
First to find the deceased?

1150
01:19:50.583 --> 01:19:51.881
Yeah.

1151
01:19:51.883 --> 01:19:53.917
[laughs]
Are you OK, pal?


1152
01:19:53.919 --> 01:19:57.220
Uhhhm... yeah I... I just...

1153
01:19:57.222 --> 01:19:59.557
You look a little like
you might be in shock!


1154
01:19:59.559 --> 01:20:04.862
I tell you I've attended
at least a hundred DOAs


1155
01:20:04.864 --> 01:20:09.465
and there's just something about this
one that's gotten me shaken up... umm...


1156
01:20:09.467 --> 01:20:11.434
I haven't slept in
a long time too.


1157
01:20:11.436 --> 01:20:14.274
All right. What do we have?

1158
01:20:15.373 --> 01:20:19.108
- OK... we've got a male and a female...
- Mm-hmm.


1159
01:20:19.110 --> 01:20:21.911
Late twenties, maybe
early thirties.


1160
01:20:21.913 --> 01:20:24.849
And I attended a call here
late last night.


1161
01:20:24.851 --> 01:20:27.884
And originally I thought it
was some sort of domestic angle.


1162
01:20:27.886 --> 01:20:29.420
Right...

1163
01:20:29.422 --> 01:20:31.388
But there just...

1164
01:20:31.390 --> 01:20:34.224
something wasn't
right, about the situation.


1165
01:20:34.226 --> 01:20:38.629
So I decided to come back around, early
in the morning to check on them, and...


1166
01:20:38.631 --> 01:20:41.165
that's when I found the bodies.

1167
01:20:41.167 --> 01:20:42.535
[echoey]: Anyone else?

1168
01:20:45.238 --> 01:20:48.975
Umm, yeah.
There was a... a baby.


1169
01:20:50.008 --> 01:20:51.975
And when I arrived

1170
01:20:51.977 --> 01:20:54.577
it was in that crib
thing, crying outside.


1171
01:20:54.579 --> 01:20:55.849
Outside?

1172
01:20:56.649 --> 01:21:00.350
And I, uh, called
child services and


1173
01:21:00.352 --> 01:21:02.518
they've taken it into care.

1174
01:21:02.520 --> 01:21:04.955
Good. I'm not good with babies.

1175
01:21:04.957 --> 01:21:06.560
All right! So...

1176
01:21:08.461 --> 01:21:11.362
Let's go have a look
at the dead people.


1177
01:21:11.364 --> 01:21:13.466
All right,
right through here, sir.


1178
01:21:20.071 --> 01:21:22.273
OK...

1179
01:21:22.275 --> 01:21:25.308
Yup. So, nobody moved
anything, huh?


1180
01:21:25.310 --> 01:21:27.478
No, they're exactly
as I found them.


1181
01:21:27.480 --> 01:21:29.112
OK.

1182
01:21:29.114 --> 01:21:31.381
You reported this as suspicious.

1183
01:21:31.383 --> 01:21:34.984
All right, you didn't think of this
as a simple overdose situation?


1184
01:21:34.986 --> 01:21:37.121
They didn't seem like the type.

1185
01:21:37.123 --> 01:21:38.121
I mean...

1186
01:21:38.123 --> 01:21:41.125
- There was something weird though.
- Weird.


1187
01:21:41.127 --> 01:21:44.661
I reported it as
suspicious because of the call.


1188
01:21:44.663 --> 01:21:48.165
I mean, these two
were absolutely convinced


1189
01:21:48.167 --> 01:21:50.466
that there was an
intruder inside the house.


1190
01:21:50.468 --> 01:21:52.635
But, the rookie that
I was with, and me


1191
01:21:52.637 --> 01:21:54.638
we searched the entire premises

1192
01:21:54.640 --> 01:21:57.041
we found no evidence
to back it up.


1193
01:21:57.043 --> 01:21:59.576
Course now I think that maybe
they were telling the truth.


1194
01:21:59.578 --> 01:22:00.446
Hmm.

1195
01:22:01.446 --> 01:22:03.479
I mean they... they just...

1196
01:22:03.481 --> 01:22:06.386
they look so <i>alive,</i>
you know what I mean?


1197
01:22:07.986 --> 01:22:08.954
Yeah.

1198
01:22:17.495 --> 01:22:19.429
Yeah.

1199
01:22:19.431 --> 01:22:22.066
They swore there was
an intruder, right?


1200
01:22:22.068 --> 01:22:24.201
That they'd seen with
their own eyes, huh?


1201
01:22:24.203 --> 01:22:27.237
But <i>you</i> thought it
couldn't be. Am I right?


1202
01:22:27.239 --> 01:22:30.407
You thought it was some kind of
delusion or hallucination.


1203
01:22:30.409 --> 01:22:32.076
Am I right?

1204
01:22:32.078 --> 01:22:33.277
Yeah, yeah. That's right, yeah.

1205
01:22:33.279 --> 01:22:36.213
I- I actually thought maybe it
was the sleep deprivation?


1206
01:22:36.215 --> 01:22:38.282
Mm-hmm. Uh-huh.

1207
01:22:38.284 --> 01:22:41.085
Look at these.
These rosy cheeks?


1208
01:22:41.087 --> 01:22:43.086
That's why they look so alive.

1209
01:22:43.088 --> 01:22:47.358
That's something we call
<i>Carbon Monoxide poisoning.</i>


1210
01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:49.727
Cold weather just kicked
in, so it's probably


1211
01:22:49.729 --> 01:22:54.098
the water heater, or the
furnace. Maybe both.


1212
01:22:54.100 --> 01:22:56.567
We'll do some tests.

1213
01:22:56.569 --> 01:22:58.001
Hey, does that door open?

1214
01:22:58.003 --> 01:23:02.139
Uhh... No, sir. It seems
to be locked with a key.


1215
01:23:02.141 --> 01:23:05.308
OK... Everyone listen up!

1216
01:23:05.310 --> 01:23:08.011
I need all of you to
exit the building.


1217
01:23:08.013 --> 01:23:11.048
Yeah. Acute CO poisoning can
sometimes cause


1218
01:23:11.050 --> 01:23:16.019
paranoia, memory loss, hallucinations,
apparitions... things like that.


1219
01:23:16.021 --> 01:23:19.322
It would've seemed all
too real to them, but


1220
01:23:19.324 --> 01:23:22.058
just one of those things.

1221
01:23:22.060 --> 01:23:24.560
You weren't to know -
don't blame yourself.


1222
01:23:24.562 --> 01:23:27.097
We'll have the baby checked out.

1223
01:23:27.099 --> 01:23:29.101
The effects are
usually reversible.


1224
01:23:30.101 --> 01:23:31.570
Real lucky they left
him out there, huh?


1225
01:23:35.807 --> 01:23:37.340
You coming?

1226
01:23:37.342 --> 01:23:39.108
[ominous music]

1227
01:23:39.110 --> 01:23:41.513
How long have you
been waiting in this house?


1228
01:23:43.815 --> 01:23:46.082
A whi-... a while...

1229
01:23:46.084 --> 01:23:47.817
OK you need to come
with me right now.


1230
01:23:47.819 --> 01:23:50.153
I need some help here,
I need some oxygen!


1231
01:23:50.155 --> 01:23:51.822
Help, help! I need some
help in here with this guy!


1232
01:23:51.824 --> 01:23:52.692
[menacing music]

1233
01:23:54.293 --> 01:23:56.125
We need some oxygen, hey!

1234
01:23:56.127 --> 01:23:58.130
OK. Hold your head up,
hold your head up...


1235
01:24:02.568 --> 01:24:05.204
[dramatic crescendo]

1236
01:24:13.611 --> 01:24:15.647
[somber piano music]

1237
01:24:15.781 --> 01:24:20.781
