1
00:03:31.473 --> 00:03:33.605
Morning, Uncle Cash.

2
00:03:40.046 --> 00:03:41.613
Some heavy reading
for ninth grade.


3
00:03:42.005 --> 00:03:43.833
It's one of mom's
old college books


4
00:03:44.094 --> 00:03:46.226
by this British guy,
Eric Padgett.


5
00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:48.838
He's like a philosopher,
writes about ethics


6
00:03:48.881 --> 00:03:49.926
and how to be good.

7
00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:52.407
So you're reading textbooks
for fun?


8
00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:54.278
I guess.

9
00:03:54.321 --> 00:03:56.236
Well, don't hurt yourself.

10
00:03:57.542 --> 00:03:58.500
Your dad up?

11
00:04:28.094 --> 00:04:30.096
- What time is it?
- Time to feed.


12
00:04:31.663 --> 00:04:32.838
- I'm going...
- Come on.


13
00:04:32.882 --> 00:04:34.187
- I'm going.
- Let's go.


14
00:04:34.231 --> 00:04:35.972
All right, all right,
all right.


15
00:04:36.015 --> 00:04:37.626
Mr. Bright-Eyes
and Bushy-Tail,


16
00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:38.757
just give me a minute.

17
00:04:42.239 --> 00:04:44.894
We ain't got time
for a Lamaze class.


18
00:04:44.937 --> 00:04:47.549
Let's go!
Come on, let's get on it.


19
00:04:49.028 --> 00:04:50.900
We got some
hungry hippos out here.


20
00:04:51.988 --> 00:04:53.250
Here, chick, chick, chick.

21
00:04:55.818 --> 00:04:58.255
No need to shove,
there's enough for everybody.


22
00:04:59.517 --> 00:05:00.518
C'mon, little guy, let's go.

23
00:05:01.214 --> 00:05:04.130
In you get. All right.
There you go.


24
00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:05.480
Get!

25
00:05:09.484 --> 00:05:11.486
Come on now.

26
00:05:12.487 --> 00:05:13.400
Let's go.

27
00:05:19.102 --> 00:05:20.190
How's he doing?

28
00:05:20.538 --> 00:05:22.758
Been lappin' up that zinc
for over a month now.


29
00:05:23.802 --> 00:05:25.282
No reason he shouldn't be
trying to breed


30
00:05:25.325 --> 00:05:26.501
with a heifer on the lot.

31
00:05:28.198 --> 00:05:29.329
Rachel would know.

32
00:05:31.331 --> 00:05:32.942
It's like the damn thing
talked to her.


33
00:05:33.203 --> 00:05:34.073
Yeah.

34
00:05:34.596 --> 00:05:35.814
Never said shit to me.

35
00:05:35.858 --> 00:05:36.815
Yeah, me neither.

36
00:05:39.818 --> 00:05:41.080
But I keep listening.

37
00:05:47.173 --> 00:05:48.218
You okay, girl?

38
00:05:51.264 --> 00:05:53.136
Dad!

39
00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:54.877
What the hell's got her
running out here


40
00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:56.139
like the house is on fire?

41
00:05:56.487 --> 00:05:58.576
- What's going on, darling?
- Come quick!


42
00:05:58.620 --> 00:05:59.534
You all right?

43
00:06:01.013 --> 00:06:01.971
It's coming!

44
00:06:08.673 --> 00:06:12.547
Hey. Hey, there she go.

45
00:06:13.112 --> 00:06:15.071
Whoa, whoa, whoa, easy,
easy, easy, easy.


46
00:06:15.114 --> 00:06:16.333
Easy, girl.

47
00:06:17.073 --> 00:06:18.422
Easy, girl.

48
00:06:20.685 --> 00:06:21.817
Yeah, I'm not liking this.

49
00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:23.079
She's pushing hard.

50
00:06:23.122 --> 00:06:24.602
Yeah, and ain't nothing
coming out.


51
00:06:25.168 --> 00:06:26.473
Whoa, whoa.

52
00:06:26.517 --> 00:06:27.910
All right, mama,
I'ma take a look,


53
00:06:27.953 --> 00:06:29.520
make sure things are in order.

54
00:06:29.781 --> 00:06:30.869
Yeah, I see the problem.

55
00:06:30.913 --> 00:06:31.827
What's wrong?

56
00:06:32.218 --> 00:06:33.524
Foal's stuck.
She's got one foot forward.


57
00:06:33.568 --> 00:06:34.438
Wanna get a vet?

58
00:06:34.873 --> 00:06:36.092
Probably long gone,
the time she get here.


59
00:06:36.135 --> 00:06:37.615
You got 10 to 15 minutes
in this state.


60
00:06:37.659 --> 00:06:39.138
And I say we on the tail end
of that.


61
00:06:42.489 --> 00:06:44.013
- Keep her still, Cash.
- Whoa.


62
00:06:44.056 --> 00:06:45.536
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

63
00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:47.233
- Easy, my girl.
- I got her.


64
00:06:47.277 --> 00:06:48.147
Pull the tail back.

65
00:06:48.539 --> 00:06:49.758
Dad's trying to fix it.

66
00:06:49.801 --> 00:06:51.803
- Got it?
- Hold on. Got the hoof!


67
00:06:51.847 --> 00:06:53.631
- All right.
- Just gotta get the hoof, girl.


68
00:06:53.675 --> 00:06:54.632
Easy, Flagen.

69
00:06:56.199 --> 00:06:57.940
- Step on back now, she got it.
- Yeah.


70
00:06:57.983 --> 00:06:59.115
She got it.

71
00:06:59.158 --> 00:07:00.595
- There it is.
- All right.


72
00:07:01.639 --> 00:07:02.553
She got it.

73
00:07:06.122 --> 00:07:08.080
Yeah, she precious little thing.

74
00:07:08.515 --> 00:07:10.779
Just think, most people
still sleeping on a Sunday.


75
00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:13.564
Sensible ones anyway.

76
00:07:14.565 --> 00:07:15.914
- Their loss.
- Yeah.


77
00:07:16.654 --> 00:07:18.003
Welcome to the family.

78
00:07:19.614 --> 00:07:20.571
Come on.

79
00:07:28.057 --> 00:07:29.624
Savannah, let's go!

80
00:07:30.973 --> 00:07:32.452
- Gonna find it?
- Yeah.


81
00:07:33.149 --> 00:07:34.541
It gets lost now and again.

82
00:07:35.586 --> 00:07:37.588
You look beautiful,
baby girl.


83
00:07:37.632 --> 00:07:39.503
- Thanks, Dad.
- Yeah.


84
00:07:41.766 --> 00:07:43.376
Why don't you come with us?

85
00:07:44.247 --> 00:07:47.337
Not really feeling
too churchy these days.


86
00:07:48.033 --> 00:07:49.600
'Sides, I need to get
that tractor running.


87
00:07:49.905 --> 00:07:51.907
I've been saying I would
for the last month.


88
00:07:53.125 --> 00:07:54.213
Well...

89
00:07:55.562 --> 00:07:57.086
come meet us
for lunch at the grill.


90
00:07:58.043 --> 00:07:59.305
Bringing out the big guns.

91
00:08:00.698 --> 00:08:01.917
Do it for the patty melt.

92
00:08:02.744 --> 00:08:04.354
Well...
...you buying?


93
00:08:04.615 --> 00:08:06.182
Hot and on the table
when you walk in.


94
00:08:06.573 --> 00:08:08.140
All right, damn it. You got me.

95
00:08:08.837 --> 00:08:09.968
Knew it would.

96
00:08:12.057 --> 00:08:13.102
Y'all have fun now.

97
00:08:13.972 --> 00:08:15.408
Get that thing fixed then.

98
00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:16.932
I'm on it.

99
00:08:19.499 --> 00:08:21.153
Well, we're just gonna
keep asking him.


100
00:08:21.632 --> 00:08:22.938
He just misses Mom.

101
00:08:23.329 --> 00:08:24.940
- Yeah.
- I do, too.


102
00:08:26.942 --> 00:08:29.335
She would have been proud
of him this morning.


103
00:08:29.684 --> 00:08:31.468
Yeah, she would.

104
00:08:43.175 --> 00:08:44.263
When I was a boy,

105
00:08:44.307 --> 00:08:45.438
my daddy would
take me out hunting.


106
00:08:46.004 --> 00:08:48.572
We'd wake up before sunrise,
traipse through the cold


107
00:08:48.833 --> 00:08:52.097
and the dark,
leaves crackling under our feet.


108
00:08:52.141 --> 00:08:53.577
Some of you know
what I am talking about.


109
00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:55.100
I see you nodding, Andy.

110
00:08:55.144 --> 00:08:58.625
And look, I stand before you
now a preacher.


111
00:08:59.191 --> 00:09:01.324
I'm just a sinner,
just like you.


112
00:09:01.628 --> 00:09:02.586
Just like you.

113
00:09:03.152 --> 00:09:04.980
There was a time
I was a real son of a bitch.


114
00:09:06.068 --> 00:09:07.156
Hell, you can look it up.

115
00:09:07.504 --> 00:09:08.984
They got a file on me down
at the police station.


116
00:09:09.027 --> 00:09:10.725
I know a little something
about that.


117
00:09:10.768 --> 00:09:12.465
All right.
Not a word out of you, Sheriff.


118
00:09:14.076 --> 00:09:15.338
But I was in those same woods

119
00:09:15.381 --> 00:09:16.905
that I'd go hunting
with my old man.


120
00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:19.690
And I had a revelation
and I realized


121
00:09:19.734 --> 00:09:20.822
God is always there.

122
00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:25.435
He's always been there,
listening, waiting, ready


123
00:09:25.478 --> 00:09:27.132
to open his arms to us.

124
00:09:27.524 --> 00:09:29.178
- Amen.
- Give me another amen.


125
00:09:29.221 --> 00:09:30.570
- Amen.
- Thank you.


126
00:09:33.835 --> 00:09:34.836
'Preciate it.

127
00:09:34.879 --> 00:09:36.315
Just wonderful, Pastor.

128
00:09:36.359 --> 00:09:37.403
Appreciate you taking the time.

129
00:09:37.447 --> 00:09:38.535
I wouldn't miss it.

130
00:09:38.578 --> 00:09:39.841
Beautiful way
to start the morning.


131
00:09:39.884 --> 00:09:41.625
- All right.
- Sheriff.


132
00:09:44.497 --> 00:09:47.544
Well, the Lord is quicker
to forgive than your fellow man.


133
00:09:47.849 --> 00:09:49.154
How's Finney holding up?

134
00:09:49.894 --> 00:09:50.895
Touch and go.

135
00:09:51.287 --> 00:09:52.810
You need to get him off
that Memphis Blind.


136
00:09:52.854 --> 00:09:53.855
Is he hunting?

137
00:09:54.159 --> 00:09:55.160
Not hardly.

138
00:09:55.595 --> 00:09:56.727
Well, it's worse than I thought.

139
00:09:56.771 --> 00:09:58.903
- Yeah.
- How about you, Savannah?


140
00:09:58.947 --> 00:10:01.079
Has your uncle taken you
hunting yet this season?


141
00:10:01.123 --> 00:10:02.907
We have,
but all I get is skunked.


142
00:10:02.951 --> 00:10:05.344
That's not true.
You've been close on a couple.


143
00:10:06.128 --> 00:10:07.433
Go on, show him
what you picked out.


144
00:10:07.477 --> 00:10:08.521
What you got?

145
00:10:08.957 --> 00:10:12.047
That is some prime
cutting steel. Look at that.


146
00:10:12.308 --> 00:10:14.963
Reckon she's got about, what,
six months of morning chores


147
00:10:15.006 --> 00:10:15.877
before you pay it off.

148
00:10:16.312 --> 00:10:17.879
Your uncle's
a prickly bastard, isn't he?


149
00:10:17.922 --> 00:10:19.663
A miser, too.

150
00:10:19.706 --> 00:10:21.317
Now this one's got you figured,
Cash.


151
00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:23.972
Yeah, she's a regular Dr. Phil.

152
00:10:28.367 --> 00:10:29.325
I'll tell you what,

153
00:10:29.978 --> 00:10:31.893
I'm gonna be eating
your dad's patty melt


154
00:10:31.936 --> 00:10:34.286
if he don't make it here soon.

155
00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:35.157
You should.

156
00:10:42.555 --> 00:10:43.426
I'll be right back.

157
00:11:11.323 --> 00:11:13.543
Finney, where the hell are you?

158
00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:16.763
Twelve-dollar burger's
getting cold.


159
00:11:38.655 --> 00:11:39.656
What's this now?

160
00:11:40.439 --> 00:11:42.528
Cash. Didn't think you'd mind.

161
00:11:43.007 --> 00:11:44.661
Doe here is just having
a little bite to eat.


162
00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:47.403
Might lose my appetite
looking at that hand though.


163
00:11:50.014 --> 00:11:52.669
Get up. Let her out.

164
00:11:53.278 --> 00:11:54.453
You left her all alone.

165
00:11:55.367 --> 00:11:57.979
We were just being polite,
keeping her company.


166
00:11:59.589 --> 00:12:01.156
Come on, Savannah.

167
00:12:03.636 --> 00:12:05.203
Fly away, little butterfly.

168
00:12:05.987 --> 00:12:07.640
We just wanna have a chat
with your uncle.


169
00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:09.947
Come here, sweetheart.

170
00:12:10.339 --> 00:12:11.862
Go get a dessert at the bar.

171
00:12:12.471 --> 00:12:14.821
I won't be long.
It's all right. Don't worry.


172
00:12:19.348 --> 00:12:20.218
Sit down.

173
00:12:24.875 --> 00:12:25.789
What do you want?

174
00:12:26.746 --> 00:12:29.749
We don't want nothing.
Big Cat does.


175
00:12:30.098 --> 00:12:31.838
I got nothing to say to Big Cat.

176
00:12:31.882 --> 00:12:33.797
Big Cat got something
to say to you.


177
00:12:35.103 --> 00:12:35.973
About your farm.

178
00:12:38.019 --> 00:12:39.672
About my farm? 
What about it?

179
00:12:47.811 --> 00:12:49.595
All right, come on.

180
00:12:56.167 --> 00:12:57.342
All right, come on.

181
00:13:00.041 --> 00:13:03.000
♪ God
I don't understand it ♪


182
00:13:03.044 --> 00:13:05.698
♪ You're always playing
To disown on me ♪


183
00:13:07.135 --> 00:13:12.053
♪ I got sucker punched,
Get me... ♪


184
00:13:15.273 --> 00:13:16.405
There she is.

185
00:13:17.754 --> 00:13:20.278
There's my girl. Church good?

186
00:13:21.323 --> 00:13:22.933
I thought
you were coming to lunch.


187
00:13:23.194 --> 00:13:24.543
I'm sorry, kiddo.

188
00:13:24.587 --> 00:13:28.156
Savannah, give me a minute
with your pops, will ya?


189
00:13:30.332 --> 00:13:31.898
Go on, darling.
Let me talk to Cash.


190
00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:37.121
I'ma make another one.

191
00:13:38.993 --> 00:13:40.995
Now, you let me know
if you have a change of heart.


192
00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:42.518
This you being funny?

193
00:13:42.866 --> 00:13:44.346
Are you really trying to fuck
with my sobriety?


194
00:13:45.912 --> 00:13:47.175
You still smoke.

195
00:13:47.218 --> 00:13:49.568
And that's some nasty-ass shit,
let me tell you.


196
00:13:53.398 --> 00:13:54.660
...this you being an asshole.

197
00:13:55.226 --> 00:13:57.837
I'm just saying.

198
00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:00.144
You can throw them back
as good as anyone.


199
00:14:01.624 --> 00:14:03.365
I was a drunken dumbass,

200
00:14:04.279 --> 00:14:05.889
now, you're throwing 'em back
for both of us.


201
00:14:07.804 --> 00:14:10.285
Now that... that is a truth
you won't hear on the radio.


202
00:14:10.328 --> 00:14:11.329
See, you missed lunch.

203
00:14:12.635 --> 00:14:14.637
The Buck and Doe
joined us at the diner today.


204
00:14:16.247 --> 00:14:18.293
They're under the impression
that you're in Big Cat's debt.


205
00:14:18.336 --> 00:14:19.207
That you owe.

206
00:14:19.816 --> 00:14:22.210
Let me tell you something
about this farm, Cash.


207
00:14:23.515 --> 00:14:25.300
Like a bucket with a hole in it.

208
00:14:25.343 --> 00:14:27.519
Did you give the note
on my sister's place to Big Cat?


209
00:14:32.002 --> 00:14:33.525
I took a loan on my place.

210
00:14:35.049 --> 00:14:36.572
I had to, or this farm
would be gone any damn way.


211
00:14:36.615 --> 00:14:37.573
Goddammit!

212
00:14:41.142 --> 00:14:43.622
You need a loan,
you go to the bank.


213
00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:45.929
Who do you think
I owe the money to?


214
00:14:45.972 --> 00:14:47.844
You think they just
keep giving you more?


215
00:14:47.887 --> 00:14:49.541
Look, I'm telling you
I did it right.


216
00:14:50.368 --> 00:14:51.848
A clear agreement,
I can pay it back


217
00:14:51.891 --> 00:14:53.328
once them cows
are ready for the sale.


218
00:14:54.068 --> 00:14:55.852
It don't matter.
You go through their office,


219
00:14:55.895 --> 00:14:57.941
you sign a bunch
of bullshit paperwork.


220
00:14:59.377 --> 00:15:00.857
That's Big Cat's money
all the same.


221
00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:02.424
Goddammit, use your brain.

222
00:15:02.728 --> 00:15:03.686
I'll tell you what,

223
00:15:04.208 --> 00:15:06.123
you ain't paid a cent
for that cabin.


224
00:15:06.167 --> 00:15:08.473
That might help fill the hole
a little bit, don't you think?


225
00:15:14.827 --> 00:15:16.438
You gave the devil an inch,
Finn.


226
00:15:18.353 --> 00:15:19.702
What was I supposed to do?

227
00:15:21.747 --> 00:15:24.315
You got an extra 100 grand?
No, sir.


228
00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:26.012
All right,
so don't worry about it.


229
00:15:26.056 --> 00:15:26.926
I'll handle it.

230
00:15:29.581 --> 00:15:32.106
No, I'll handle it.

231
00:15:33.455 --> 00:15:35.109
I know how these animals feed.

232
00:15:42.028 --> 00:15:43.160
You need to dry out.

233
00:15:44.683 --> 00:15:45.902
Quit hanging around the house.

234
00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:52.082
Go huntin', take Savannah.
She wants to go with you.


235
00:15:53.039 --> 00:15:57.740
Well, all I'm in the mood
to shoot is this bourbon.


236
00:15:59.568 --> 00:16:02.266
But for you, I'll do it outside.

237
00:16:21.459 --> 00:16:23.853
Here.

238
00:16:23.896 --> 00:16:25.942
They're cooking right out
in the wide open, man.


239
00:16:26.421 --> 00:16:27.596
Making pills inside.

240
00:16:28.205 --> 00:16:30.555
Yeah, we come back here,
four or five guys all armed up,


241
00:16:31.077 --> 00:16:32.514
they ain't gonna know
what's what for.


242
00:16:32.557 --> 00:16:34.385
In and out of there with
every one of them damn pills.


243
00:16:34.429 --> 00:16:36.300
All right, look it. I'm gonna
go around the building.


244
00:16:36.344 --> 00:16:37.388
Get a better look.

245
00:16:37.432 --> 00:16:38.824
You stay here, keep an eye,
okay?


246
00:16:47.355 --> 00:16:48.225
Reg?

247
00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:50.140
Reg?

248
00:16:56.233 --> 00:16:57.930
There he is! Freeze, asshole!

249
00:16:57.974 --> 00:16:59.062
Shit.

250
00:17:04.241 --> 00:17:05.764
Hands up! Get 'em up!

251
00:17:05.808 --> 00:17:06.852
Leave 'em up!

252
00:17:22.999 --> 00:17:24.522
Look, I appreciate
you got a job to do.


253
00:17:24.566 --> 00:17:25.871
Sir, I know it's important,

254
00:17:25.915 --> 00:17:27.569
but Mr. Barkley
has a very busy day.


255
00:17:27.612 --> 00:17:29.527
I'm happy to schedule you
a time to come in.


256
00:17:29.571 --> 00:17:30.746
Well, you best make it now.

257
00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:33.749
'Cause, I'm not leaving
until I talk to Zeke.


258
00:17:33.792 --> 00:17:36.186
It's all right, Sue.
He's with me.


259
00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:39.755
What you up to?

260
00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:41.974
Just homework.

261
00:17:42.497 --> 00:17:44.325
Honey, you're gonna run off
to some fancy school


262
00:17:44.368 --> 00:17:46.762
and leave your old man here
home alone, ain't you?


263
00:17:46.805 --> 00:17:48.677
Right now I'm just trying
to pass trig.


264
00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:50.418
Yeah?
Well, let me take a look.


265
00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:52.202
You know, I used to get down

266
00:17:52.246 --> 00:17:53.377
with some math
back in high school.


267
00:17:55.031 --> 00:17:56.467
So, Cash.

268
00:17:56.946 --> 00:17:57.947
Yeah.

269
00:17:58.513 --> 00:18:00.036
What can I do for you?

270
00:18:00.645 --> 00:18:01.559
I'm here to find out

271
00:18:01.994 --> 00:18:04.214
what Finney owes,
so we can take care of it.


272
00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:08.349
I'm sorry, Cash.
You seem to be confused.


273
00:18:09.001 --> 00:18:10.568
I don't think this is even math.

274
00:18:10.612 --> 00:18:12.831
"Secant..."
"Secant..."


275
00:18:12.875 --> 00:18:14.964
Hell, I don't even think
that explanation's in English.


276
00:18:20.535 --> 00:18:21.884
Hey, honey, you stay right here.

277
00:18:25.975 --> 00:18:27.324
Uncle Finney, open up!

278
00:18:27.368 --> 00:18:28.847
Who is it?

279
00:18:28.891 --> 00:18:29.805
I see him!

280
00:18:30.327 --> 00:18:31.981
Okay. Go hide in the back.
Go hide in the bathroom.


281
00:18:32.024 --> 00:18:33.635
Hey, he's trying
to get out the back!


282
00:18:33.678 --> 00:18:34.505
Come on, Finn.

283
00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:36.159
You don't wanna make us
kick this door in!


284
00:18:36.202 --> 00:18:37.378
I'm just trying to figure out

285
00:18:37.421 --> 00:18:38.727
why you're beating
on my door unannounced!


286
00:18:38.770 --> 00:18:39.945
Open this door, Finney.

287
00:18:45.821 --> 00:18:46.865
Hey.

288
00:18:46.909 --> 00:18:48.040
Hey. How you doing, Buck?

289
00:18:49.868 --> 00:18:50.826
Okay.

290
00:18:51.305 --> 00:18:52.784
Big Cat just wanted us
to pay you a little visit.


291
00:18:52.828 --> 00:18:54.264
Said to check up
on our investment.


292
00:18:54.308 --> 00:18:55.352
Yeah, yeah.

293
00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:56.962
Yeah, I'ma...
I'ma pull it together.


294
00:18:57.398 --> 00:19:00.705
I mean, it ain't even due yet,
so you know.


295
00:19:00.749 --> 00:19:01.837
Leave him alone!

296
00:19:02.533 --> 00:19:04.230
It doesn't look like
you're pulling together shit.


297
00:19:04.753 --> 00:19:06.320
- Stop!
- Shut that kid up.


298
00:19:07.321 --> 00:19:08.365
Don't you touch her!

299
00:19:09.105 --> 00:19:10.498
- Lay off!
- Hey, hey, hey.


300
00:19:10.541 --> 00:19:11.977
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

301
00:19:12.848 --> 00:19:14.763
Damn straight. This here...

302
00:19:18.723 --> 00:19:19.768
Get him, boys.

303
00:19:20.116 --> 00:19:22.074
Far as the contract
is concerned,


304
00:19:22.118 --> 00:19:23.728
the farm belongs to Big Cat.

305
00:19:23.772 --> 00:19:26.731
Now maybe you can earn it back.

306
00:19:26.775 --> 00:19:28.907
But it's not the kind of debt
that you can just


307
00:19:29.473 --> 00:19:30.953
walk in and pay.

308
00:19:31.519 --> 00:19:32.955
Even if you had the money.

309
00:19:33.695 --> 00:19:37.394
No, the debt's settled
when Big Cat says it's settled.


310
00:19:37.438 --> 00:19:40.397
Until then, you don't own
the ranch.


311
00:19:41.267 --> 00:19:43.095
Now, Cash,
is there anything else


312
00:19:43.139 --> 00:19:44.358
I can do for you?

313
00:19:56.195 --> 00:19:58.981
Hey.

314
00:19:59.764 --> 00:20:02.811
All right, little darling,
I ain't gonna hurt you.


315
00:20:12.777 --> 00:20:13.822
I'm sorry.

316
00:20:36.279 --> 00:20:38.281
Buck... Okay. Okay.

317
00:20:38.324 --> 00:20:40.457
Look, you shoot me,
ain't nobody getting paid.


318
00:20:40.501 --> 00:20:41.676
It's got nothing
to do with money.


319
00:21:07.049 --> 00:21:08.398
What happened?

320
00:21:08.442 --> 00:21:10.705
They put a gun
to his ears and fired.


321
00:21:10.748 --> 00:21:12.576
- Finney?
- I can't hear shit.


322
00:21:13.534 --> 00:21:14.839
Let's get you inside.
Come on.


323
00:21:17.451 --> 00:21:18.321
Come on.

324
00:21:21.498 --> 00:21:24.370
I am so sorry. I'm sorry.

325
00:21:24.414 --> 00:21:26.372
- Easy. Just breathe.
- I'm so sorry.


326
00:21:26.416 --> 00:21:27.461
Just breathe it out.

327
00:21:28.636 --> 00:21:29.593
I cut one of 'em.

328
00:21:32.553 --> 00:21:33.641
Which one?

329
00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:35.730
The one that's always giggling.

330
00:21:38.689 --> 00:21:42.084
The Doe.
I'm gonna get this figured out.


331
00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:45.957
I need you to look after
your dad, okay?


332
00:21:47.829 --> 00:21:49.265
I'll be back
in a couple of hours.


333
00:21:51.789 --> 00:21:54.313
Okay.

334
00:21:56.838 --> 00:21:57.795
Mr. Williams?

335
00:21:58.622 --> 00:21:59.623
Sheriff will see you now.

336
00:22:06.456 --> 00:22:07.501
Looky here.

337
00:22:08.327 --> 00:22:10.155
Finally turning yourself in,
Cash?


338
00:22:11.417 --> 00:22:12.810
Good to see you too, Duke.

339
00:22:15.334 --> 00:22:16.858
Cash, come in.

340
00:22:22.298 --> 00:22:24.779
Always figured I'd have you
sitting in a cell.


341
00:22:25.214 --> 00:22:26.520
Not across from my desk.

342
00:22:26.781 --> 00:22:27.782
What's this about?

343
00:22:28.739 --> 00:22:30.436
I got a Big Cat problem.

344
00:22:31.742 --> 00:22:33.352
Now, this ought
to be interesting.


345
00:22:33.701 --> 00:22:35.877
Well, Finney went to her
for a loan on the farm


346
00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:37.095
and she's tightening the screws.

347
00:22:37.792 --> 00:22:39.707
Seems anyone should know better,
it's him.


348
00:22:40.621 --> 00:22:42.187
Come on, Sheriff.

349
00:22:42.971 --> 00:22:45.800
I mean, she's the damn queen
of Odim County.


350
00:22:47.018 --> 00:22:49.281
That's something you sure
as hell had a hand in, Cash.


351
00:22:51.196 --> 00:22:53.068
So if you wanna talk
about that, we're all ears.


352
00:22:53.721 --> 00:22:55.984
As far as the loan,
I'd say you talk to Zeke.


353
00:22:56.288 --> 00:22:57.159
Yeah.

354
00:22:58.334 --> 00:23:00.945
Yeah. Well, did that.

355
00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:05.123
Look, we wanna take her down
just as bad as you do.


356
00:23:05.384 --> 00:23:08.039
But we need proof of wrongdoing,
not just accusations.


357
00:23:08.692 --> 00:23:09.867
So how about it, Cash?

358
00:23:10.259 --> 00:23:11.477
You got some information?

359
00:23:12.653 --> 00:23:15.656
If you did, it could solve a lot
of problems for both of us.


360
00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:21.966
I'm just trying to hold on
to my sister's place.


361
00:23:22.227 --> 00:23:24.795
Then bring me something concrete
I can take to a judge.


362
00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:21.156
Hang my daddy's gun.

363
00:24:24.246 --> 00:24:25.377
Here. Here.

364
00:24:46.355 --> 00:24:48.749
Lazarus, you're gonna have
to excuse me.


365
00:24:48.792 --> 00:24:50.359
I really like your ideas,

366
00:24:50.402 --> 00:24:51.882
but I'm gonna have
to ponder them.


367
00:24:52.666 --> 00:24:54.102
Yeah, yeah, no problem.

368
00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:56.191
What's up, man?

369
00:25:02.153 --> 00:25:03.067
Cash.

370
00:25:11.597 --> 00:25:14.209
Wanna tell me why you're putting
the screws on me and my family?


371
00:25:15.210 --> 00:25:17.212
Having your men put their hands
on a little girl?


372
00:25:17.908 --> 00:25:19.083
You're upset.

373
00:25:20.389 --> 00:25:23.697
Shot Finney's ears out
in front of Savannah.


374
00:25:25.307 --> 00:25:27.004
His ears
will be ringing for a few days,


375
00:25:27.048 --> 00:25:27.918
no doubt about that.

376
00:25:28.527 --> 00:25:30.399
But the message was for you,
Cash.


377
00:25:31.269 --> 00:25:32.662
You missed it before.

378
00:25:33.924 --> 00:25:36.144
When I have to send a message
a second time,


379
00:25:36.187 --> 00:25:37.623
it comes with more volume.

380
00:25:38.799 --> 00:25:41.715
I don't want your cows
or your land.


381
00:25:43.151 --> 00:25:45.806
Hell, I didn't wanna give Finney
a loan in the first damn place,


382
00:25:45.849 --> 00:25:46.894
because I knew

383
00:25:47.242 --> 00:25:49.287
the drunken son of a bitch
would piss it away.


384
00:25:50.506 --> 00:25:54.466
So here I am
doing the honorable thing,


385
00:25:54.902 --> 00:25:56.730
giving you the opportunity
to work it off,


386
00:25:57.556 --> 00:26:01.430
so I don't have to put Finney
in a hole


387
00:26:01.473 --> 00:26:03.432
next to your sister, Rachel.

388
00:26:04.694 --> 00:26:05.608
I'm out.

389
00:26:06.565 --> 00:26:07.653
We had an agreement.

390
00:26:09.612 --> 00:26:11.179
I've grown since you left.

391
00:26:12.441 --> 00:26:15.357
It's no longer just
plants and pills.


392
00:26:17.881 --> 00:26:21.015
I'm into empire-building, Cash.

393
00:26:22.799 --> 00:26:25.367
I got my fingers and hands
in everything.


394
00:26:30.067 --> 00:26:34.071
It's a delicate time
in my enterprise.


395
00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:36.813
We're on the verge
of something big.


396
00:26:38.859 --> 00:26:42.036
And I could use an extra hand.

397
00:26:43.559 --> 00:26:45.343
Now, I got good, strong boys,

398
00:26:45.822 --> 00:26:47.868
raised on my rules
and dedicated, every one of 'em,


399
00:26:48.912 --> 00:26:50.522
but they don't have your gifts.

400
00:26:51.741 --> 00:26:54.744
You were always so good
with people.


401
00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:59.009
But then you could be
a cold-hearted son of a bitch


402
00:26:59.053 --> 00:27:00.010
just as easy.

403
00:27:02.186 --> 00:27:04.841
That's what made you so good.

404
00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:07.148
I'm not sure
what I'm supposed to consider,


405
00:27:08.062 --> 00:27:09.977
unless you give me
some specifics.


406
00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:13.850
Three jobs of my choosing.

407
00:27:13.894 --> 00:27:15.809
That's what it'll take
to pay back the debt.


408
00:27:16.897 --> 00:27:17.985
If I decline?

409
00:27:18.768 --> 00:27:20.901
You can take the silver
or you can take the lead.


410
00:27:24.818 --> 00:27:28.038
I do this,
it's to pay off a debt.


411
00:27:30.693 --> 00:27:32.173
Three jobs and I'm done.

412
00:27:34.566 --> 00:27:35.829
Simple and plain.

413
00:27:36.351 --> 00:27:37.439
Of course, baby.

414
00:27:38.527 --> 00:27:41.138
No need to be complicated.

415
00:28:18.610 --> 00:28:19.568
How you doing?

416
00:28:20.482 --> 00:28:21.570
Worst goddamn thing

417
00:28:21.613 --> 00:28:22.963
that happened
in front of Savannah.


418
00:28:24.051 --> 00:28:25.095
I don't disagree.

419
00:28:28.577 --> 00:28:30.666
Grown man, can't take care
of my own land.


420
00:28:30.709 --> 00:28:33.016
Couldn't take care of my wife.
Now, my little girl.


421
00:28:35.192 --> 00:28:39.022
You're not the only one twisting
yourself up about things.


422
00:28:39.066 --> 00:28:43.026
No. Maybe I just wasn't cut out
to be a father.


423
00:28:45.289 --> 00:28:46.900
You gotta quit
talking like that.


424
00:28:48.989 --> 00:28:50.251
That's not helping anyone.

425
00:28:50.512 --> 00:28:52.166
- I know.
- Especially Savannah.


426
00:28:53.384 --> 00:28:54.733
I'm just tired of thinking.

427
00:28:57.301 --> 00:28:58.607
I'm tired of feeling.

428
00:29:00.478 --> 00:29:01.740
Tired of drinking.

429
00:29:02.872 --> 00:29:04.004
Being hungover.

430
00:29:08.704 --> 00:29:10.097
I'm so tired of drinking.

431
00:29:15.885 --> 00:29:17.582
It's not gonna be easy
drawing off.


432
00:29:20.411 --> 00:29:23.762
But I'll be there for you
every way I can.


433
00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:37.907
How much trouble are we in?

434
00:29:39.604 --> 00:29:40.562
What can I do?

435
00:29:42.477 --> 00:29:44.174
Keep reading. Keep studying.

436
00:29:46.046 --> 00:29:47.743
So you don't make
the same mistakes we have.


437
00:29:47.786 --> 00:29:49.963
Don't talk to me like
I don't understand.


438
00:29:52.052 --> 00:29:52.922
I know you do.

439
00:29:54.576 --> 00:29:55.490
I can help.

440
00:29:55.969 --> 00:29:57.187
I know you can.

441
00:29:57.753 --> 00:29:59.798
I just want you to stay focused
on what matters.


442
00:30:00.103 --> 00:30:02.149
That's not some stupid books.

443
00:30:03.063 --> 00:30:04.978
That's dad, you, and the farm.

444
00:30:06.283 --> 00:30:07.545
I can't fault you there.

445
00:30:10.722 --> 00:30:11.680
You're right.

446
00:30:12.246 --> 00:30:14.030
But we got this
worked out, okay?


447
00:30:14.291 --> 00:30:16.772
There's nothing you can do
on this, I promise.


448
00:30:19.862 --> 00:30:21.037
How about we go find your dad?

449
00:30:21.081 --> 00:30:22.821
He's got a fire going
and everything.


450
00:30:23.822 --> 00:30:25.607
I can't promise you s'mores.

451
00:31:06.474 --> 00:31:07.823
What's your name, son?

452
00:31:07.866 --> 00:31:09.868
Harlen.

453
00:31:10.739 --> 00:31:14.308
Harlen. As much pain as you're
in right now,


454
00:31:14.351 --> 00:31:16.614
I can promise you it's gonna get
a lot, lot worse


455
00:31:17.267 --> 00:31:18.399
if you don't tell me

456
00:31:18.442 --> 00:31:19.748
who you're working
with on this thing.


457
00:31:20.227 --> 00:31:23.665
Nobody, heard you were
making pills out there.


458
00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:27.060
Figured we'd see if we could get
a little for ourselves.


459
00:31:27.103 --> 00:31:28.235
That's it.

460
00:31:28.278 --> 00:31:29.714
That doesn't sound
very sophisticated.


461
00:31:30.759 --> 00:31:31.760
No.

462
00:31:32.195 --> 00:31:36.243
Please, I'm sorry.
It won't happen again.


463
00:31:36.286 --> 00:31:39.637
I would like to believe you,
but I gotta be sure.


464
00:31:40.725 --> 00:31:43.641
And I can't rightly have you
running around...


465
00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:49.212
with those thumbs attached
to those thieving hands.


466
00:31:49.473 --> 00:31:53.564
No, wait, no, no, no, no.
I won't come back. I swear.


467
00:31:53.999 --> 00:31:57.264
No, no, no, please don't shoot.
No, wait, don't shoot.


468
00:31:57.307 --> 00:31:58.526
Please, please, please.

469
00:31:58.569 --> 00:32:00.963
- Are you sure?
- Just take my thumb.


470
00:32:02.443 --> 00:32:04.184
That's a good decision.

471
00:32:10.755 --> 00:32:11.930
No, no.

472
00:32:11.974 --> 00:32:14.324
Hold on. Okay.

473
00:32:16.457 --> 00:32:17.675
There you go.

474
00:32:33.343 --> 00:32:34.388
Yeah?

475
00:32:48.750 --> 00:32:49.925
Thanks for coming out.

476
00:32:49.968 --> 00:32:52.145
Do I have a choice?

477
00:32:55.452 --> 00:32:56.453
Nope.

478
00:33:01.154 --> 00:33:03.068
Get your fucking ass
out of here.


479
00:33:03.112 --> 00:33:04.418
You trash piece of shit.

480
00:33:14.645 --> 00:33:16.430
Hey, give me one of them.

481
00:33:18.258 --> 00:33:19.563
Where the hell are you, man?

482
00:33:19.607 --> 00:33:20.477
No.

483
00:33:21.304 --> 00:33:24.568
Well, hurry the fuck up,
they already dropped me.


484
00:33:25.569 --> 00:33:26.527
You're such a dick.

485
00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:00.909
Go see what we're dealing with.

486
00:34:02.345 --> 00:34:03.825
Must've read my mind.

487
00:34:09.831 --> 00:34:12.573
Goddammit, Harlen.
I told you to be careful.


488
00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:15.750
They got Reggie. He's dead.

489
00:34:15.793 --> 00:34:17.752
And she cut
my fucking thumb off!


490
00:34:18.405 --> 00:34:21.103
We hit these motherfuckers
back tonight.


491
00:34:21.886 --> 00:34:24.237
Let's go! Get loaded up!

492
00:34:25.194 --> 00:34:26.369
Call the boys, Bobby.

493
00:34:26.761 --> 00:34:28.937
All of them. Get fucking ready.

494
00:34:31.635 --> 00:34:34.421
Five guys. Look like locals.

495
00:34:35.335 --> 00:34:36.336
All strung out.

496
00:34:36.858 --> 00:34:39.556
Talking about revenge
and calling in the boys.


497
00:34:39.991 --> 00:34:41.776
Calling in the boys?

498
00:34:43.038 --> 00:34:45.170
Looks like we got us
some big-timers.


499
00:34:46.694 --> 00:34:48.391
Talk to me.
What do we got?


500
00:34:48.435 --> 00:34:49.827
Yeah, it's just like we thought.

501
00:34:54.397 --> 00:34:56.530
All right,
we'll go in the front.


502
00:34:57.400 --> 00:34:59.010
Why don't you go
in the back, Cash?


503
00:35:01.622 --> 00:35:02.710
I'm gonna need a gun.

504
00:35:03.014 --> 00:35:04.015
I got your gun.

505
00:35:06.366 --> 00:35:07.323
Yeah, baby.

506
00:35:09.717 --> 00:35:10.761
Ready, brother?

507
00:35:12.197 --> 00:35:13.808
All right, boys. Move out.

508
00:35:20.075 --> 00:35:21.468
Gimme the fucking gun,
asshole.


509
00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:25.298
Here you go. There's your gun.

510
00:35:38.049 --> 00:35:39.399
Motherfuckers.

511
00:35:44.055 --> 00:35:45.405
Shut the fuck up, man.

512
00:35:45.448 --> 00:35:47.145
Here's what we're gonna do,
we're gonna...


513
00:36:07.949 --> 00:36:10.952
There's the son of a bitch.
Look at that, Cash got him.


514
00:36:13.171 --> 00:36:14.999
He almost got him.

515
00:36:22.311 --> 00:36:23.530
My gun wasn't loaded.

516
00:36:24.792 --> 00:36:26.576
Whoops.

517
00:36:26.620 --> 00:36:28.404
Cash,
you just passed the shit test.


518
00:36:28.448 --> 00:36:29.753
Let's get the fuck out of here.

519
00:36:49.251 --> 00:36:50.252
All right

520
00:37:04.745 --> 00:37:06.573
You're up early.

521
00:37:09.967 --> 00:37:12.013
Goddamn.

522
00:37:12.753 --> 00:37:14.232
How long you been
standing there?


523
00:37:15.277 --> 00:37:17.279
Long enough to know
you mean business.


524
00:37:18.802 --> 00:37:20.151
- Yeah.
- You ready?


525
00:37:20.761 --> 00:37:23.067
I never needed something
more in my life.


526
00:37:46.569 --> 00:37:48.136
Twelve o'clock.

527
00:37:54.969 --> 00:37:56.274
Goddamn.

528
00:37:58.407 --> 00:37:59.713
I'm shaking like an old man.

529
00:37:59.756 --> 00:38:01.454
Stay focused on the task.

530
00:38:02.890 --> 00:38:06.371
In other words, God.

531
00:38:06.415 --> 00:38:07.982
- God.
- Family.


532
00:38:08.025 --> 00:38:10.071
- Family.
- Survival.


533
00:38:10.767 --> 00:38:11.899
Survival.

534
00:38:15.642 --> 00:38:18.209
Damn, I got it.

535
00:38:18.514 --> 00:38:19.689
All right, come on.

536
00:38:20.037 --> 00:38:22.387
First things first,
gotta remove the skin.


537
00:38:22.866 --> 00:38:24.825
Start at the top.
Just work your way down.


538
00:38:25.303 --> 00:38:27.088
Just little cuts. Got it?

539
00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:31.048
There you go.

540
00:38:37.011 --> 00:38:38.186
Thank you.

541
00:38:44.279 --> 00:38:45.759
She's got me hemmed in.

542
00:38:47.021 --> 00:38:50.111
That's what she does.
But you're still sitting there.


543
00:38:51.242 --> 00:38:53.767
A lot of people in that same
situation can't say that.


544
00:38:55.029 --> 00:38:56.465
Remember that kid, Tyler Mack?

545
00:38:57.422 --> 00:38:59.381
- Yeah, the dealer?
- Yeah.


546
00:38:59.424 --> 00:39:01.122
Barely. I was out by then.

547
00:39:01.165 --> 00:39:02.166
I liked him.

548
00:39:03.254 --> 00:39:06.214
But he was reckless, you know?
Deep into pills.


549
00:39:06.257 --> 00:39:10.044
Hey, that hillbilly heroin?
Razor-sharp claws.


550
00:39:10.087 --> 00:39:12.263
That was my preferred ticket
to oblivion.


551
00:39:12.612 --> 00:39:15.266
Me, Rachel, and Finney
we'd all party with Tyler.


552
00:39:16.354 --> 00:39:17.660
Get loaded for days.

553
00:39:19.227 --> 00:39:20.750
At that point,
it wasn't even fun.


554
00:39:21.011 --> 00:39:21.925
In so deep.

555
00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:24.537
All any of us cared about
was getting bent.


556
00:39:25.755 --> 00:39:28.584
We were all just right there
on the edge.


557
00:39:28.628 --> 00:39:29.890
I could feel it.

558
00:39:36.679 --> 00:39:39.726
Then I get the call
about my sister's overdose.


559
00:39:40.161 --> 00:39:44.948
Doctor said the pills dampened
the electrical signal


560
00:39:44.992 --> 00:39:47.647
to her heart.
Snuffed the spark right out.


561
00:39:50.388 --> 00:39:52.303
Spent the next two weeks
getting wasted.


562
00:39:54.262 --> 00:39:56.960
Missed my own sister's funeral,
I was such a mess.


563
00:39:58.048 --> 00:40:00.660
That's when I knew
I needed help.


564
00:40:07.449 --> 00:40:09.538
Took losing her for me
to see that.


565
00:40:11.192 --> 00:40:13.194
A lot of people never get
on the right track.


566
00:40:14.238 --> 00:40:15.413
Is that what I'm doing?

567
00:40:16.545 --> 00:40:18.547
You think
I don't experience doubt?


568
00:40:19.069 --> 00:40:20.244
You think I'm not struggling?

569
00:40:21.115 --> 00:40:25.641
Cash, you're making progress.
That's all any of us can do.


570
00:40:25.685 --> 00:40:26.729
Don't sell it short.

571
00:40:28.775 --> 00:40:30.080
What was it that drew you out?

572
00:40:30.646 --> 00:40:32.082
It's nothing quite so dramatic.

573
00:40:33.344 --> 00:40:35.520
I had a revelation.
Pure and simple.


574
00:40:37.218 --> 00:40:41.048
My eyes were opened like Saul
on the road to Damascus.


575
00:40:42.615 --> 00:40:44.225
Yeah, that's pretty dramatic
to me.


576
00:40:45.052 --> 00:40:46.140
Maybe you're right, I guess.

577
00:40:47.228 --> 00:40:49.404
Hell, we got the scars
to prove it.


578
00:41:04.462 --> 00:41:05.376
Yeah?

579
00:41:09.990 --> 00:41:10.991
Okay.

580
00:41:11.992 --> 00:41:13.167
No, I'll handle it.

581
00:41:14.777 --> 00:41:15.952
Okay.

582
00:41:26.441 --> 00:41:27.398
What's the word?

583
00:41:29.487 --> 00:41:30.575
Lazarus.

584
00:41:32.969 --> 00:41:33.840
His number's up.

585
00:41:35.842 --> 00:41:36.756
Why's that?

586
00:41:37.321 --> 00:41:39.149
Got some side hustle going.
Big Cat don't approve.


587
00:41:39.193 --> 00:41:40.673
She wants an example made.

588
00:41:40.716 --> 00:41:45.329
So, he'll be coming with us,
but he's not coming back.


589
00:41:47.418 --> 00:41:48.724
That's a pretty big change
of plans


590
00:41:48.768 --> 00:41:50.247
to be dropping last minute.

591
00:41:50.291 --> 00:41:51.640
It's fucked, man.

592
00:41:51.945 --> 00:41:53.424
He's been working
this deal for months.


593
00:41:53.468 --> 00:41:55.949
Could open up a whole lane
of East Coast distribution.


594
00:41:58.691 --> 00:42:02.390
But you know Big Cat.
She makes the decision.


595
00:42:02.433 --> 00:42:04.000
You gonna be able
to handle this?


596
00:42:05.567 --> 00:42:08.570
Yeah. Easy, no question.

597
00:42:08.613 --> 00:42:11.442
Just make it clean.
Nothing fancy.


598
00:42:12.356 --> 00:42:14.228
I got it. Jesus.

599
00:42:17.057 --> 00:42:18.145
Boy.

600
00:42:18.754 --> 00:42:20.364
Just about jumped out
of your damn skin.


601
00:42:20.408 --> 00:42:21.801
Yeah, thanks, asshole.

602
00:42:22.236 --> 00:42:23.541
All right, my brothers.

603
00:42:24.847 --> 00:42:26.936
How's about a little 'cid
for this trip?


604
00:42:26.980 --> 00:42:28.329
That's how you wanna go
into this?


605
00:42:28.590 --> 00:42:30.200
Well, I do my best work
on a tab.


606
00:42:30.505 --> 00:42:31.419
Two tabs, that's too much.

607
00:42:31.811 --> 00:42:32.942
That's over the top.
Ain't that right, Wes?


608
00:42:32.986 --> 00:42:34.552
Come on, man.
Stop messing around.


609
00:42:35.728 --> 00:42:37.251
Goddamn, man,
y'all need to relax.


610
00:42:37.817 --> 00:42:39.427
These dudes, they like me.

611
00:42:39.470 --> 00:42:42.430
They're gonna get spooked by all
your fucking stressor vibes.


612
00:42:43.953 --> 00:42:45.520
All right, let's roll, baby.

613
00:42:46.129 --> 00:42:47.609
Time to become legends, boys.

614
00:43:01.362 --> 00:43:03.320
Now make a left there,
cross that bridge.


615
00:43:13.678 --> 00:43:14.854
You wanna give us
a hand here, Wes?


616
00:43:16.725 --> 00:43:18.292
Or you gonna keep pacing
a hole in the ground?


617
00:43:22.644 --> 00:43:23.819
What's the deal, man?

618
00:43:23.863 --> 00:43:25.778
You've been acting fucking weird
all day.


619
00:43:25.821 --> 00:43:27.431
You run out of Percocet
or something?


620
00:43:30.304 --> 00:43:31.784
Wha...

621
00:43:37.877 --> 00:43:39.356
The fuck did you just do?

622
00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:40.401
He knew something was up.

623
00:43:40.923 --> 00:43:42.098
The only thing he knew

624
00:43:42.142 --> 00:43:44.057
is you were acting
like a goddamn jackass.


625
00:43:44.318 --> 00:43:45.928
You said do it clean.
I did it clean.


626
00:43:45.972 --> 00:43:49.149
After. Do it clean after.

627
00:43:50.019 --> 00:43:51.368
It's his deal, isn't it?

628
00:43:52.152 --> 00:43:53.196
His contact.

629
00:43:53.588 --> 00:43:54.458
Shit.

630
00:43:54.807 --> 00:43:55.808
Yeah, shit.

631
00:44:00.421 --> 00:44:01.988
Help me get him
in the goddamn van.


632
00:44:05.426 --> 00:44:06.862
Wanna get off the tarp?

633
00:44:10.561 --> 00:44:12.085
Are you gonna help me get him
in the van?


634
00:44:12.781 --> 00:44:14.043
I think I'm gonna fucking puke.

635
00:44:17.481 --> 00:44:18.526
Just get the phone.

636
00:44:23.792 --> 00:44:25.098
It's them. Shit.

637
00:44:25.794 --> 00:44:27.187
They're 15 minutes out.

638
00:44:28.449 --> 00:44:29.754
Write back, tell 'em

639
00:44:30.364 --> 00:44:31.844
he can't make it,
but his boys will be there.


640
00:44:32.757 --> 00:44:34.890
It's fucking locked. I can't...

641
00:44:38.111 --> 00:44:40.026
Here, channel your best Lazarus.

642
00:44:40.069 --> 00:44:41.941
Right. Okay.

643
00:44:51.515 --> 00:44:52.908
What happens if they ask
about Lazarus?


644
00:44:53.953 --> 00:44:58.305
When they ask,
you let me handle it.


645
00:44:58.827 --> 00:45:01.221
Stay cool and get the deal done.
Can you do that?


646
00:45:01.264 --> 00:45:02.222
Yeah.

647
00:45:02.918 --> 00:45:04.528
All right,
here they fucking come.


648
00:45:33.862 --> 00:45:35.298
Everybody has their thing.

649
00:45:37.083 --> 00:45:40.042
For me, it's one specific one.

650
00:45:41.870 --> 00:45:45.961
My men know what it is
and they avoid it at all costs


651
00:45:46.005 --> 00:45:48.877
just to not set me off.

652
00:45:50.270 --> 00:45:53.142
He doesn't like surprises.

653
00:45:56.058 --> 00:45:59.757
So, you can imagine
my gut feeling...


654
00:46:01.411 --> 00:46:02.543
when I get a text...

655
00:46:04.675 --> 00:46:06.808
10 minutes
before our scheduled meeting...


656
00:46:08.027 --> 00:46:10.333
informing me
that I'll be encountering...


657
00:46:11.900 --> 00:46:14.729
two faces I do not know.

658
00:46:15.643 --> 00:46:17.775
Instead of the one
that I was expecting.


659
00:46:19.038 --> 00:46:19.995
Lazarus.

660
00:46:23.477 --> 00:46:24.869
So I ask you...

661
00:46:28.177 --> 00:46:30.963
where is sweet,

662
00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:33.356
fun-time Lazarus?

663
00:46:34.575 --> 00:46:37.404
And why the fuck isn't he here?

664
00:46:38.013 --> 00:46:39.710
- Look, there must be some...
- He couldn't make it.


665
00:46:40.450 --> 00:46:41.843
We're here to handle it for him.

666
00:46:42.713 --> 00:46:43.976
It's no more complicated
than that.


667
00:46:45.151 --> 00:46:47.153
What did Lazarus say
in his text?


668
00:46:52.549 --> 00:46:53.463
"LOL."

669
00:46:53.986 --> 00:46:56.075
"I'm totally blown out
right now."


670
00:46:56.510 --> 00:46:58.991
"My guys will be there
to cover me."


671
00:47:01.036 --> 00:47:02.342
See, I know Lazarus.

672
00:47:03.691 --> 00:47:05.040
Boy likes to have fun.

673
00:47:06.520 --> 00:47:08.739
That's why he's so pleasant
to be around.


674
00:47:09.349 --> 00:47:13.092
But this...
this is out of character.


675
00:47:13.570 --> 00:47:15.094
We're all a little annoyed
and surprised


676
00:47:15.137 --> 00:47:16.182
he couldn't make it.

677
00:47:17.792 --> 00:47:19.837
But if you knew Lazarus
like we do, well...


678
00:47:21.230 --> 00:47:23.232
it's not so out of character
for Mr. Fun-Time.


679
00:47:33.634 --> 00:47:36.419
Nobody move, or I put you down.

680
00:47:37.029 --> 00:47:38.030
Don't you do it.

681
00:47:38.291 --> 00:47:40.162
Well, this is a major surprise.

682
00:47:40.945 --> 00:47:42.077
There's an explanation,

683
00:47:42.121 --> 00:47:44.427
but I'm not in a position
to give it.


684
00:47:44.471 --> 00:47:47.822
Now, I'm gonna assume
that nobody wants to die


685
00:47:47.865 --> 00:47:49.128
on this fine afternoon.

686
00:47:49.693 --> 00:47:51.434
And we sure as shit
don't wanna tell Big Cat


687
00:47:51.478 --> 00:47:53.219
why this turned
into a bloodbath.


688
00:47:54.829 --> 00:47:56.396
So let's stay focused
on the matter at hand.


689
00:47:56.439 --> 00:47:57.397
Can we do that?

690
00:48:00.748 --> 00:48:01.966
If you can't play nice,

691
00:48:02.793 --> 00:48:04.665
I'll take you
out of the equation.


692
00:48:04.708 --> 00:48:05.709
Understood?

693
00:48:07.015 --> 00:48:10.323
Yeah, I understand.

694
00:48:13.021 --> 00:48:14.240
Your product's all there.

695
00:48:17.112 --> 00:48:18.070
We good?

696
00:48:19.897 --> 00:48:21.203
Get the money.

697
00:48:29.385 --> 00:48:30.430
Wayne!

698
00:48:32.736 --> 00:48:33.868
Wayne!

699
00:48:34.434 --> 00:48:35.957
All right, kid, let's slow down.

700
00:48:36.784 --> 00:48:38.264
We can still work this out.

701
00:48:39.091 --> 00:48:40.918
Wayne? You hear me, Wayne?

702
00:48:43.834 --> 00:48:45.575
You motherfuckers!

703
00:48:47.186 --> 00:48:48.535
Would you stop shooting

704
00:48:49.057 --> 00:48:51.364
and just listen
to what I have to say?


705
00:48:51.886 --> 00:48:52.843
Fuck you!

706
00:48:53.322 --> 00:48:54.410
Fuck you!

707
00:48:55.411 --> 00:48:57.109
We fired in self-defense.

708
00:48:57.848 --> 00:48:59.241
You know that's true.

709
00:49:00.286 --> 00:49:02.070
I need you to be smarter
than this.


710
00:49:05.639 --> 00:49:06.640
Shit.

711
00:49:19.566 --> 00:49:21.133
Nope, drop it.

712
00:49:22.090 --> 00:49:24.179
Do it now
or I'll shoot you in the face.


713
00:49:25.267 --> 00:49:26.703
This can play out one
of two ways.


714
00:49:27.443 --> 00:49:28.357
I can kill you

715
00:49:28.749 --> 00:49:29.967
and take the money and drugs
back to Big Cat


716
00:49:30.011 --> 00:49:31.273
and roll the dice
on a busted deal.


717
00:49:31.317 --> 00:49:33.841
Or, and this is
my personal favorite,


718
00:49:34.885 --> 00:49:36.322
you take the drugs,
we take the money,


719
00:49:36.365 --> 00:49:38.150
just like we planned,
you go on living,


720
00:49:38.541 --> 00:49:40.369
we go on living.
What do you say?


721
00:49:43.242 --> 00:49:44.156
Smart kid.

722
00:49:44.547 --> 00:49:45.809
Come here.

723
00:50:00.476 --> 00:50:01.347
Okay.

724
00:50:01.999 --> 00:50:03.827
Actually could have gone
a lot worse.


725
00:50:24.500 --> 00:50:26.067
Get the bag.

726
00:50:37.992 --> 00:50:39.341
Do I even wanna know
what that is?


727
00:50:40.473 --> 00:50:41.387
No.

728
00:50:44.303 --> 00:50:45.565
You're in the back.

729
00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:47.480
- Are you serious?
- Yep.


730
00:50:47.523 --> 00:50:49.482
Get in there
and babysit your handiwork.


731
00:51:05.846 --> 00:51:07.935
- You all right?
- All right.


732
00:51:13.288 --> 00:51:15.159
So, three jobs?

733
00:51:18.424 --> 00:51:19.425
It settles us up.

734
00:51:20.556 --> 00:51:21.688
That was number two.

735
00:51:23.385 --> 00:51:25.692
That don't sit well with me.
Not one bit.


736
00:51:25.735 --> 00:51:26.649
Yeah.

737
00:51:27.084 --> 00:51:28.303
Well, it's not fitting too well
with me either,


738
00:51:28.347 --> 00:51:31.263
so if you got any ideas,
I'm all ears.


739
00:51:34.004 --> 00:51:35.005
There she is.

740
00:51:35.484 --> 00:51:36.833
Hey, honey, how was school?

741
00:51:36.877 --> 00:51:37.965
Good, I guess.

742
00:51:39.923 --> 00:51:40.924
Everything all right?

743
00:51:42.317 --> 00:51:44.276
Another day.

744
00:51:44.798 --> 00:51:45.842
Tip top.

745
00:51:46.930 --> 00:51:48.323
I'm gonna go inside,
so you can finish


746
00:51:48.367 --> 00:51:50.412
whatever it is
you don't want me to hear.


747
00:51:50.456 --> 00:51:51.457
I appreciate it, honey.

748
00:51:51.979 --> 00:51:53.328
- Be in there in a minute.
- Great.


749
00:51:58.812 --> 00:52:00.814
What if Big Cat
don't stick to her word?


750
00:52:02.511 --> 00:52:04.208
That's why I got a backup plan.

751
00:52:17.657 --> 00:52:19.398
There a reason
you came ready for war?


752
00:52:20.181 --> 00:52:22.749
Is there a reason you invited me
out to the middle of nowhere?


753
00:52:23.880 --> 00:52:25.491
I wanna give you Big Cat.

754
00:52:25.534 --> 00:52:26.492
Yeah?

755
00:52:27.449 --> 00:52:28.755
How you gonna do that, Cash?

756
00:52:30.060 --> 00:52:31.366
She's got labs
all over these hills,


757
00:52:31.410 --> 00:52:32.628
all producing.

758
00:52:32.672 --> 00:52:36.284
She's trading trucks
full of drugs for cash.


759
00:52:36.328 --> 00:52:37.633
That's just for starters.

760
00:52:39.679 --> 00:52:41.507
That sound
like a mighty good story.


761
00:52:43.030 --> 00:52:44.553
But I'm gonna need more
than a story.


762
00:52:45.249 --> 00:52:47.382
I need something
that's gonna tie her directly


763
00:52:47.426 --> 00:52:49.602
to everything that's happening.
Can you give me that?


764
00:52:49.645 --> 00:52:51.212
You tell me what you want,
I'll get it.


765
00:52:52.300 --> 00:52:53.823
But I don't exist not
to anybody.


766
00:52:53.867 --> 00:52:55.303
It gets out I'm feeding you...

767
00:52:57.261 --> 00:53:00.003
...Big Cat roasts my family
on a spit, you understand?


768
00:53:01.004 --> 00:53:01.875
I get it.

769
00:53:03.267 --> 00:53:04.921
I understand what you need

770
00:53:06.053 --> 00:53:07.837
and what it means
to take care of your family.


771
00:53:09.012 --> 00:53:10.971
I got you on that,
I give you my word.


772
00:53:12.625 --> 00:53:14.235
I could call my buddy down
at the DA,


773
00:53:14.278 --> 00:53:16.455
we get into it and see
what we need for a conviction,


774
00:53:16.498 --> 00:53:18.979
but I need you to not fuck me
on this, Cash.


775
00:53:22.025 --> 00:53:23.026
I want her gone.

776
00:53:28.641 --> 00:53:29.598
Me too.

777
00:53:32.296 --> 00:53:33.167
Good.

778
00:53:36.388 --> 00:53:38.215
Pick a better meeting spot
next time.


779
00:53:40.696 --> 00:53:41.915
Bottom right corner.

780
00:53:43.656 --> 00:53:45.135
Breathe, relax.

781
00:53:48.095 --> 00:53:50.097
Bottom left corner.

782
00:53:50.140 --> 00:53:52.491
All right, snug
in your shoulder, loose hands.


783
00:53:53.709 --> 00:53:56.930
I can be snug or looser,
I can't do both.


784
00:53:57.321 --> 00:54:00.412
Well, pull it in with your arms,
not your hands.


785
00:54:01.021 --> 00:54:02.675
Slow it all down, Savannah.

786
00:54:03.023 --> 00:54:04.764
It's not about speed,
it's process.


787
00:54:05.678 --> 00:54:09.725
See it, say the word,
squeeze that trigger,


788
00:54:09.769 --> 00:54:10.813
you know what to do.

789
00:54:13.512 --> 00:54:14.948
For God.

790
00:54:18.517 --> 00:54:19.474
Family.

791
00:54:23.696 --> 00:54:24.871
Survival.

792
00:54:25.872 --> 00:54:28.744
All right, second ring, good.

793
00:54:28.788 --> 00:54:30.180
Team effort, there you go.

794
00:54:31.530 --> 00:54:32.444
Are we done?

795
00:54:33.357 --> 00:54:35.490
- Heck no!
- That's what I'm talking about.


796
00:54:43.411 --> 00:54:44.891
Your license and registration,
please.


797
00:54:51.637 --> 00:54:52.594
There you go.

798
00:54:54.640 --> 00:54:55.771
What's that about?

799
00:54:56.293 --> 00:54:58.208
That's gratitude, officer.

800
00:54:58.513 --> 00:55:00.210
It's courtesy
from our first lady


801
00:55:00.254 --> 00:55:01.516
of Odim County.

802
00:55:01.951 --> 00:55:04.214
- It's for you.
- What's that, about 100 bucks?


803
00:55:04.258 --> 00:55:05.128
Yes.

804
00:55:05.912 --> 00:55:07.479
Now, that's a handsome sum,
right there.


805
00:55:07.522 --> 00:55:09.219
Yeah.

806
00:55:09.263 --> 00:55:10.482
I'm gonna let you hold on to it.

807
00:55:11.961 --> 00:55:15.878
You're all right, officer,
thank you.


808
00:55:16.270 --> 00:55:17.619
I want you to step out
of the car.


809
00:55:20.013 --> 00:55:21.144
Are you sure about that?

810
00:55:22.015 --> 00:55:23.582
- One hundred percent.
- I don't think


811
00:55:23.625 --> 00:55:26.106
that's in your best interest,
officer, I... I don't. I...


812
00:55:26.149 --> 00:55:27.760
Well, I want you to step out
of the car,


813
00:55:27.803 --> 00:55:31.372
I want you to pop the trunk,
so I can do a nice inventory


814
00:55:31.415 --> 00:55:33.853
search of the old girl.
I'm gonna go bumper to bumper.


815
00:55:34.462 --> 00:55:36.116
Yeah, I'm... No.

816
00:55:37.683 --> 00:55:39.685
Woah! Let it fucking go!

817
00:55:39.728 --> 00:55:41.382
Get out the fucking car!

818
00:55:44.994 --> 00:55:46.213
It'll be all right.

819
00:55:46.256 --> 00:55:47.780
Give me your fucking arm!

820
00:55:48.345 --> 00:55:50.130
Yeah, you fucked up today.

821
00:55:51.218 --> 00:55:52.393
Yeah.

822
00:55:53.263 --> 00:55:55.483
Now you get to think
about what you just tried to do.


823
00:55:57.441 --> 00:55:59.705
Fuck! Fuck you!

824
00:55:59.966 --> 00:56:02.795
Fuck!

825
00:56:03.404 --> 00:56:04.536
Goddamn.

826
00:56:04.579 --> 00:56:06.450
You just fucked up big-time!

827
00:56:07.147 --> 00:56:09.366
Yeah, you got plenty of time
to think about this.


828
00:56:09.976 --> 00:56:11.673
I got one of Big Cat's
fucking mules


829
00:56:11.717 --> 00:56:13.457
on the side of the road.

830
00:56:15.503 --> 00:56:17.679
Cash, it's Duke.
Man, pick up when I'm calling,


831
00:56:17.723 --> 00:56:18.941
I'm trying
to get a hold of you.


832
00:56:19.986 --> 00:56:22.641
I talked to my guy at the DA
and he says if you can give us


833
00:56:22.684 --> 00:56:24.294
these drug labs on a map,

834
00:56:24.338 --> 00:56:26.166
we may be able
to put this thing together.


835
00:56:26.862 --> 00:56:28.298
I'm gonna need you
to wear a wire.


836
00:56:28.342 --> 00:56:30.213
You can't hide under a rock
on this one.


837
00:56:30.779 --> 00:56:32.433
Call me back. Clock ticking.

838
00:56:43.531 --> 00:56:45.925
Time to go, Cash.
Get in the car.


839
00:56:45.968 --> 00:56:47.013
Where we going?

840
00:56:49.450 --> 00:56:51.147
Don't worry about that.
You just get in the car.


841
00:56:51.408 --> 00:56:52.845
I don't get in the car with you.

842
00:56:54.977 --> 00:56:57.023
- Why not?
- I don't like you.


843
00:56:58.241 --> 00:56:59.591
Because I think
you're an asshole.


844
00:57:01.810 --> 00:57:03.551
Well, we don't think much
of you, either.


845
00:57:04.247 --> 00:57:05.684
So I guess we'll just have
to risk it.


846
00:57:20.481 --> 00:57:22.918
Heard there was a real
clusterfuck in the woods?


847
00:57:49.466 --> 00:57:53.122
You're late!
Come on, boys.


848
00:57:53.688 --> 00:57:55.559
Big Cat wants everyone
around the table.


849
00:57:56.604 --> 00:57:58.650
- Zeke.
- Cash.


850
00:58:07.615 --> 00:58:08.703
Quiet down.

851
00:58:10.270 --> 00:58:12.838
I said quiet down.
I got something to say.


852
00:58:14.187 --> 00:58:15.449
I want you to know...

853
00:58:17.451 --> 00:58:18.626
that we are growing.

854
00:58:21.150 --> 00:58:23.500
And with that,
I wanna draw your attention


855
00:58:23.544 --> 00:58:24.850
to my son Zeke.

856
00:58:25.764 --> 00:58:31.334
You did things for my business
that I never knew possible.


857
00:58:33.772 --> 00:58:36.905
So I want it noted, in front
of all these reprobates...


858
00:58:39.560 --> 00:58:43.433
...that I love you
and I appreciate you.


859
00:58:44.913 --> 00:58:46.262
I love you, Mom.

860
00:58:50.266 --> 00:58:51.920
To my baby boy, Zeke.

861
00:58:52.791 --> 00:58:54.923
Zeke.

862
00:58:55.750 --> 00:58:58.927
And now to this pouty-faced
son of a bitch...


863
00:58:58.971 --> 00:59:00.755
...Cash.

864
00:59:01.843 --> 00:59:05.368
Worked for me back in the day.
Things didn't go so well.


865
00:59:06.805 --> 00:59:09.329
It got kind of ugly.

866
00:59:10.330 --> 00:59:11.418
But I don't blame you, Cash.

867
00:59:11.461 --> 00:59:14.595
I know
I can be a nasty old bitch.


868
00:59:17.859 --> 00:59:20.340
But I thought I'd give you
another chance to do


869
00:59:20.949 --> 00:59:21.950
right by these hills.

870
00:59:22.995 --> 00:59:25.519
And boy, did you.

871
00:59:26.041 --> 00:59:29.915
You salvaged a deal
that in anyone else's hands


872
00:59:29.958 --> 00:59:32.221
would have been a goat fuck.

873
00:59:33.657 --> 00:59:37.226
But you delivered
like you always did.


874
00:59:38.097 --> 00:59:40.839
I got big plans for you.

875
00:59:41.404 --> 00:59:43.624
I got big plans for all of you.

876
00:59:46.322 --> 00:59:48.498
I'm talking greenback dollars.

877
00:59:48.542 --> 00:59:50.500
- Yeah!
- Truckloads


878
00:59:50.544 --> 00:59:52.589
and truckloads
of greenback dollars.


879
00:59:53.895 --> 00:59:56.028
Let's drink
to fucking truckloads!


880
01:00:09.432 --> 01:00:10.825
You want out of my crew.

881
01:00:11.434 --> 01:00:12.827
You take the mark.

882
01:00:23.664 --> 01:00:26.798
- Yeah. You too.
- Take care.


883
01:00:33.065 --> 01:00:35.763
All right, you animals,
move it into the other room.


884
01:00:37.330 --> 01:00:38.853
Get your asses in here.

885
01:00:45.991 --> 01:00:47.557
Are you ready
for the entertainment?


886
01:00:52.214 --> 01:00:54.826
Shit.
Okay, come on, baby.


887
01:00:58.307 --> 01:01:00.483
Let's show the boys who we got

888
01:01:00.527 --> 01:01:02.485
joining us this evening.

889
01:01:09.188 --> 01:01:10.537
Now we're talking.

890
01:01:10.580 --> 01:01:11.581
There we go.

891
01:01:12.495 --> 01:01:13.975
That's what I'm talking about.

892
01:01:18.632 --> 01:01:20.416
You all know Duke.

893
01:01:20.460 --> 01:01:22.418
Yup. Yeah.

894
01:01:22.462 --> 01:01:25.378
He's our top-notch deputy.

895
01:01:26.466 --> 01:01:28.598
Real fan of our work.

896
01:01:30.513 --> 01:01:34.082
Probably got your picture up
on a cork board.


897
01:01:36.955 --> 01:01:41.307
He's been a real thorn
in our side.


898
01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:45.441
But what Duke here
failed to realize


899
01:01:46.355 --> 01:01:50.055
is these hills, they talk to me,

900
01:01:50.098 --> 01:01:51.578
they tell me things,

901
01:01:52.318 --> 01:01:56.191
and they're telling me right now
to do such


902
01:01:56.931 --> 01:01:59.238
savage things to you

903
01:01:59.934 --> 01:02:03.372
that it spreads like wildfire,

904
01:02:03.416 --> 01:02:07.159
and don't nobody wanna follow
in your footsteps.


905
01:02:09.204 --> 01:02:13.295
Jett, come introduce yourself
to the deputy.


906
01:02:13.774 --> 01:02:15.036
Ooh, Jett.

907
01:02:40.322 --> 01:02:41.845
Straighten up now, Duke.

908
01:02:42.672 --> 01:02:46.415
And say hello to Odim County's
badass brothers.


909
01:02:47.590 --> 01:02:50.593
Now, I want you boys
to get creative.


910
01:02:50.942 --> 01:02:52.334
Feel free to mix it up.

911
01:02:52.378 --> 01:02:53.335
Yeah.

912
01:02:53.683 --> 01:02:54.771
Ooh.

913
01:02:55.250 --> 01:02:56.512
I got it all laid out for you.

914
01:03:07.088 --> 01:03:08.437
Yeah.

915
01:03:14.878 --> 01:03:15.923
Yeah, buddy.

916
01:03:19.448 --> 01:03:21.842
There a problem, officer?

917
01:03:23.235 --> 01:03:25.063
License and registration.

918
01:03:26.716 --> 01:03:28.327
Yeah, we got that.

919
01:03:50.740 --> 01:03:54.744
I don't think I've ever seen
knees shatter like that.


920
01:03:55.180 --> 01:03:56.529
Fuck.

921
01:03:58.357 --> 01:04:01.838
I wanna see
just how badly you wanna live.


922
01:04:04.058 --> 01:04:05.799
So if you beg just right,

923
01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:08.758
I might
let you crawl out of here.


924
01:04:08.802 --> 01:04:11.500
Would you like that opportunity?

925
01:04:17.158 --> 01:04:19.465
Get that thing off him.
See what comes.


926
01:04:25.253 --> 01:04:26.689
I... I got a son.

927
01:04:29.127 --> 01:04:31.085
And my son needs me.

928
01:04:32.130 --> 01:04:34.393
And I promise you,
I swear to God,


929
01:04:34.654 --> 01:04:36.438
I swear on everything I love,
I'll...


930
01:04:36.743 --> 01:04:38.658
I'll walk away,
I'll never say anything


931
01:04:38.701 --> 01:04:39.920
to anybody about anything.

932
01:04:41.095 --> 01:04:43.358
I'm begging you, please.

933
01:04:44.011 --> 01:04:46.492
That's good for me to hear.

934
01:04:51.410 --> 01:04:52.846
Please.

935
01:04:54.282 --> 01:04:58.112
But that's not enough for me.
I gotta send a message.


936
01:04:58.156 --> 01:04:59.287
Please.

937
01:05:00.462 --> 01:05:01.855
Somebody in here,
just fucking help...


938
01:05:01.898 --> 01:05:06.077
Nope, we're gonna
do this right and proper.


939
01:05:06.120 --> 01:05:09.036
No.

940
01:05:09.341 --> 01:05:10.646
The only question is...

941
01:05:11.821 --> 01:05:14.302
which of these goes where?

942
01:05:15.608 --> 01:05:17.044
Any suggestions?

943
01:05:20.743 --> 01:05:23.094
Seriously?

944
01:05:26.575 --> 01:05:29.665
Come on now,
that is some weak sauce.


945
01:05:31.580 --> 01:05:34.540
Cash.
You gonna do us the honors?


946
01:05:38.544 --> 01:05:40.067
I think everybody's had enough.

947
01:05:43.288 --> 01:05:45.072
Just let me take him
out to the woods,


948
01:05:45.116 --> 01:05:47.335
I'll finish him there...

949
01:05:48.815 --> 01:05:50.295
then dispose of what's left.

950
01:05:52.732 --> 01:05:56.823
Y'all reached your limit
on this?


951
01:06:14.101 --> 01:06:16.408
If you're gonna survive
in these hills,


952
01:06:16.712 --> 01:06:18.671
you need to get used
to a little blood.


953
01:06:19.106 --> 01:06:21.195
Isn't that right, Cash?

954
01:06:21.674 --> 01:06:24.764
Take him out back,
feed him to my dogs.


955
01:06:26.244 --> 01:06:28.202
Then you can bury what's left.

956
01:06:32.815 --> 01:06:33.947
And then I'm done.

957
01:06:36.776 --> 01:06:38.125
You're done?

958
01:06:38.865 --> 01:06:39.735
Yeah.

959
01:06:41.215 --> 01:06:42.347
Three jobs.

960
01:06:43.217 --> 01:06:44.175
That was the deal.

961
01:06:46.786 --> 01:06:49.092
It don't matter what you think.

962
01:06:50.006 --> 01:06:51.182
I say when it's over.

963
01:06:52.183 --> 01:06:54.707
And that goes for your niece,

964
01:06:55.447 --> 01:06:57.362
your drunk-ass brother-in-law,

965
01:06:58.537 --> 01:07:02.758
and your sister's bones
buried at the farm.


966
01:07:06.284 --> 01:07:07.546
You got me, boy?

967
01:07:10.810 --> 01:07:11.724
Yeah.

968
01:07:13.334 --> 01:07:14.292
What?

969
01:07:19.079 --> 01:07:21.560
Yeah. I got it.

970
01:07:24.127 --> 01:07:25.085
Good.

971
01:07:26.347 --> 01:07:28.741
Now get the fuck
out of my sight.


972
01:07:43.321 --> 01:07:45.105
Get me a drink. A whiskey.

973
01:07:45.148 --> 01:07:46.149
Yes, ma'am.

974
01:07:51.590 --> 01:07:52.808
Hey, hey.

975
01:07:54.941 --> 01:07:57.291
You sure as hell know how
to push that woman's buttons.


976
01:07:58.771 --> 01:08:00.947
I can't say I've ever seen
Big Cat take so much


977
01:08:00.990 --> 01:08:02.688
from one person
and still be breathing.


978
01:08:03.602 --> 01:08:04.472
So...

979
01:08:05.691 --> 01:08:08.389
you better stay put
until she lands on a conclusion.


980
01:08:57.699 --> 01:08:58.787
What?

981
01:08:59.310 --> 01:09:00.311
You're gonna wanna see this.

982
01:09:03.357 --> 01:09:05.533
Had our guy get in
that deputy's phone.


983
01:09:08.406 --> 01:09:10.016
Look who he's been talking to.

984
01:09:11.844 --> 01:09:12.801
Get out.

985
01:09:22.333 --> 01:09:23.551
How do you want me
to handle this?


986
01:09:25.379 --> 01:09:26.293
Severely.

987
01:09:27.512 --> 01:09:28.382
Yes, ma'am.

988
01:09:54.452 --> 01:09:55.496
Dad, you ready?

989
01:09:55.757 --> 01:09:57.846
Yeah. Yeah, I'll be right out.

990
01:10:15.298 --> 01:10:17.039
Yeah, hey, we about ready.

991
01:10:17.736 --> 01:10:18.998
Gonna miss this one.

992
01:10:19.041 --> 01:10:20.478
You do know I ain't been back
to that church


993
01:10:20.521 --> 01:10:21.653
since the funeral.

994
01:10:21.696 --> 01:10:22.741
You got Savannah there.

995
01:10:24.003 --> 01:10:25.657
That's enough conviction
for the three of us.


996
01:10:26.092 --> 01:10:27.223
No doubt about that.

997
01:10:27.267 --> 01:10:28.181
What you got going on?

998
01:10:28.660 --> 01:10:30.139
Backup plan went to shit.

999
01:10:31.053 --> 01:10:33.360
I'm figuring a way to fix it,
get some evidence.


1000
01:10:33.969 --> 01:10:35.580
- You need some help?
- Sure don't.


1001
01:10:35.623 --> 01:10:36.450
I want you and Savannah

1002
01:10:36.755 --> 01:10:37.973
as far away
from this as possible.


1003
01:10:38.234 --> 01:10:39.366
I gotta go.

1004
01:10:39.410 --> 01:10:41.150
Hey, Cash. Ca...

1005
01:10:41.716 --> 01:10:42.935
Whoa.

1006
01:10:42.978 --> 01:10:44.371
- Hey.
- Dad, looking nice.


1007
01:10:44.719 --> 01:10:45.633
Thank you.

1008
01:10:46.286 --> 01:10:47.853
It's a little dusty,
but I think it'll work.


1009
01:10:47.896 --> 01:10:49.637
It's fine. It... 
You look great.

1010
01:10:49.681 --> 01:10:51.204
Thank you. You ready?

1011
01:10:51.247 --> 01:10:52.901
- Yeah, I'm ready.
- All right.


1012
01:11:17.448 --> 01:11:18.492
Good morning, everybody.

1013
01:11:19.145 --> 01:11:20.233
Good morning.

1014
01:11:20.276 --> 01:11:21.756
Nice to see
your beautiful faces.


1015
01:11:23.497 --> 01:11:24.933
Today, I...

1016
01:11:27.545 --> 01:11:28.459
I think...

1017
01:11:31.592 --> 01:11:34.465
I think today I'm gonna deviate
from my planned remarks...


1018
01:11:35.988 --> 01:11:37.076
to speak to you from the heart.

1019
01:11:38.599 --> 01:11:42.385
We tend to focus on those sins
that bring tangible things


1020
01:11:42.429 --> 01:11:45.650
into our lives,
whether it's greed...


1021
01:11:47.129 --> 01:11:48.696
lust, pride.

1022
01:11:49.871 --> 01:11:51.177
Something we don't think
about much


1023
01:11:51.220 --> 01:11:53.092
is ridding our lives
of those sins


1024
01:11:53.135 --> 01:11:54.746
that have no worldly benefit,

1025
01:11:56.399 --> 01:12:00.665
like guilt, self-loathing,
anger at God,


1026
01:12:00.708 --> 01:12:02.057
or anger at ourselves.

1027
01:12:02.318 --> 01:12:04.190
These are the things
that weigh us down


1028
01:12:04.233 --> 01:12:05.757
and distract us
from what's important.


1029
01:12:05.800 --> 01:12:07.149
Honey, I think I gotta step out.

1030
01:12:07.193 --> 01:12:08.586
God doesn't want you
carrying the weight


1031
01:12:08.629 --> 01:12:10.065
- of your sin.
- I'll come with you.


1032
01:12:10.109 --> 01:12:11.327
He wants you to be present...

1033
01:12:11.371 --> 01:12:12.459
I'll be back.

1034
01:12:12.503 --> 01:12:13.634
...with those
who are with you now.


1035
01:12:14.722 --> 01:12:16.637
Dedicate yourself to them.

1036
01:12:18.073 --> 01:12:20.859
Let them be the benefactors
of your love and labor.


1037
01:12:33.393 --> 01:12:35.351
Hey, Dad.

1038
01:12:35.395 --> 01:12:36.309
Hey.

1039
01:12:37.049 --> 01:12:38.267
You okay?

1040
01:12:44.535 --> 01:12:46.580
I am so sorry, Savannah.

1041
01:12:46.841 --> 01:12:48.016
It's okay.

1042
01:12:49.191 --> 01:12:51.367
I'm sorry I haven't been
a better dad to you.


1043
01:12:51.629 --> 01:12:52.586
Dad, it's okay.

1044
01:12:52.630 --> 01:12:54.849
Losing Mom is...

1045
01:12:57.243 --> 01:12:58.374
It's just been tough.

1046
01:12:59.898 --> 01:13:01.943
But I promise I'm gonna
be a better dad to you.


1047
01:13:02.944 --> 01:13:04.076
I love you.

1048
01:13:04.642 --> 01:13:08.646
Come here.

1049
01:13:08.907 --> 01:13:10.778
I think Mom would just want us
to be okay.


1050
01:13:12.998 --> 01:13:14.956
That she would.

1051
01:13:15.217 --> 01:13:16.392
Apologies, Finn.

1052
01:13:17.742 --> 01:13:19.395
I've been sitting
on that one for a while.


1053
01:13:19.831 --> 01:13:21.136
Might have got
a little overanxious.


1054
01:13:21.180 --> 01:13:22.181
Thank you.

1055
01:13:22.834 --> 01:13:25.053
I thought it was beautiful.

1056
01:13:26.402 --> 01:13:29.405
- It's good to see you.
- And you.


1057
01:13:29.971 --> 01:13:31.799
Maybe this means
you'll be coming around


1058
01:13:31.843 --> 01:13:32.800
a little more often.

1059
01:13:33.496 --> 01:13:34.802
Shit.

1060
01:13:37.326 --> 01:13:38.371
I don't know.

1061
01:13:38.632 --> 01:13:40.286
I just wanna take care
of mine right now.


1062
01:13:40.591 --> 01:13:43.245
Well, when you're ready,
we'll be here.


1063
01:13:44.072 --> 01:13:45.160
I appreciate that.

1064
01:13:51.689 --> 01:13:52.603
Let's go.

1065
01:14:03.875 --> 01:14:06.007
How about you say we get us
a couple of patty melts?


1066
01:14:06.268 --> 01:14:07.139
Yeah, I'm down.

1067
01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:08.619
- You are?
- Yes.


1068
01:14:09.315 --> 01:14:10.969
Hey, Finney, where's Cash?

1069
01:14:16.844 --> 01:14:18.367
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1070
01:14:18.890 --> 01:14:20.761
Hey, hey. C'mon, c'mon.
Hey! Call the cops.


1071
01:14:21.109 --> 01:14:22.328
Call the cops right now!

1072
01:14:23.024 --> 01:14:24.722
- Get back!
- Hey! Get back. Get back now.


1073
01:14:40.738 --> 01:14:42.478
Dad! No!

1074
01:14:45.307 --> 01:14:47.483
- Savannah, run!
- Dad!


1075
01:14:47.527 --> 01:14:49.572
Back up!
Everybody, back the fuck up!


1076
01:14:49.616 --> 01:14:51.966
Run! Run!

1077
01:14:57.755 --> 01:14:58.843
Back up!

1078
01:14:59.147 --> 01:15:02.150
Get the fuck back, old man!
Back the fuck up!


1079
01:15:02.194 --> 01:15:03.456
You're not too old to get shot.

1080
01:15:07.547 --> 01:15:09.027
You're gonna kill him!

1081
01:15:09.767 --> 01:15:10.811
Stop it!

1082
01:15:13.596 --> 01:15:15.120
You're gonna kill him!

1083
01:15:15.860 --> 01:15:17.862
You're gonna kill him!

1084
01:15:20.255 --> 01:15:22.475
Come on. Run!

1085
01:15:22.518 --> 01:15:23.868
- No!
- Go!


1086
01:15:28.742 --> 01:15:29.612
All right.

1087
01:15:30.744 --> 01:15:32.615
It'd be a real thrill
to put down a preacher.


1088
01:15:32.659 --> 01:15:33.921
Just take it easy, Doe.

1089
01:15:33.965 --> 01:15:35.053
Let's get out of here!

1090
01:15:35.401 --> 01:15:37.708
Now! Come on!
Let's go, let's go!


1091
01:15:41.842 --> 01:15:44.845
Finney. Finney. Jesus.

1092
01:15:45.759 --> 01:15:47.021
Sweet Jesus.

1093
01:15:47.065 --> 01:15:48.327
Is that help coming?

1094
01:16:08.521 --> 01:16:10.479
I'm sorry, he's gone.

1095
01:16:11.654 --> 01:16:13.308
I'll be right outside
if you need me.


1096
01:16:48.517 --> 01:16:51.825
Sheriff, what a nice surprise.

1097
01:16:52.434 --> 01:16:53.871
This a personal call?

1098
01:16:54.785 --> 01:16:55.786
Afraid not.

1099
01:16:56.395 --> 01:16:58.832
Finney Thompson was beaten
in front of the church today.


1100
01:16:59.311 --> 01:17:00.442
I heard about that.

1101
01:17:01.182 --> 01:17:02.749
He's since passed on.

1102
01:17:04.577 --> 01:17:05.796
See, things happen out

1103
01:17:05.839 --> 01:17:07.580
in broad daylight
in front of people.


1104
01:17:07.972 --> 01:17:11.236
It's hard for me to control.
It makes us both look bad.


1105
01:17:12.150 --> 01:17:14.108
Sounds like the boys
got carried away.


1106
01:17:15.196 --> 01:17:16.807
But it is what it is now.

1107
01:17:18.939 --> 01:17:21.550
I'm saying I need you to make it
a little easier on me.


1108
01:17:22.290 --> 01:17:23.596
People are watching now.

1109
01:17:25.032 --> 01:17:26.642
You might want to focus

1110
01:17:26.991 --> 01:17:29.123
on keeping
your own house in order.


1111
01:17:30.603 --> 01:17:34.302
I would hate to see
any more of your boys


1112
01:17:34.999 --> 01:17:37.262
get swallowed up by these hills.

1113
01:17:42.136 --> 01:17:44.922
And Lindsey,

1114
01:17:45.226 --> 01:17:48.229
it is a plum job you got...

1115
01:17:49.361 --> 01:17:51.232
with a lot of perks I provide.

1116
01:17:53.017 --> 01:17:56.281
A lot of folks
would like a nice job like that.


1117
01:17:57.064 --> 01:17:58.631
So you stay sharp...

1118
01:17:59.937 --> 01:18:02.853
'cause there is always somebody
waiting behind.


1119
01:18:05.856 --> 01:18:07.379
You have a nice day.

1120
01:18:13.689 --> 01:18:15.517
I should've done something.

1121
01:18:17.998 --> 01:18:20.174
I... I should've stopped 'em.

1122
01:18:20.218 --> 01:18:21.175
No.

1123
01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:24.222
No, sweetie, no.

1124
01:18:26.746 --> 01:18:28.052
There weren't nothing
you could do.


1125
01:18:28.835 --> 01:18:30.924
Don't ever blame yourself.

1126
01:18:33.057 --> 01:18:36.712
Where are the police?
We have to tell them who did it.


1127
01:18:36.756 --> 01:18:37.888
They already know.

1128
01:18:39.150 --> 01:18:40.978
Then why don't they do
something?


1129
01:18:42.805 --> 01:18:45.591
Because these people make
everybody afraid.


1130
01:18:50.204 --> 01:18:52.293
Well, what are we supposed
to do then?


1131
01:18:53.468 --> 01:18:55.253
We're gonna get you
to a safe place.


1132
01:18:56.994 --> 01:18:58.691
Get you to a safe place, okay?

1133
01:19:10.921 --> 01:19:13.793
I'm done letting her take
from this family.


1134
01:19:17.318 --> 01:19:18.406
Pray with me.

1135
01:19:19.930 --> 01:19:21.105
Pray with me now.

1136
01:19:28.112 --> 01:19:30.766
I don't think God's gonna
like what I have to say.


1137
01:19:30.810 --> 01:19:32.159
Just try.

1138
01:19:32.203 --> 01:19:33.944
Burdens change shoulders
when you pray.


1139
01:19:34.727 --> 01:19:35.946
Just speak your truth.

1140
01:19:40.428 --> 01:19:41.299
Father,

1141
01:19:42.169 --> 01:19:44.693
you took Rachel,
and now you've taken Finney.


1142
01:19:44.737 --> 01:19:46.217
And I got to be honest...

1143
01:19:47.609 --> 01:19:49.437
I just don't see a plan here.

1144
01:19:53.137 --> 01:19:55.574
I don't see how a loving God
could take my family


1145
01:19:55.617 --> 01:19:58.969
and leave that little girl
with no mom and dad.


1146
01:19:59.970 --> 01:20:01.362
It don't make no sense.

1147
01:20:02.146 --> 01:20:03.974
In fact, as long
as we're being honest here,


1148
01:20:04.017 --> 01:20:06.237
I wonder if you're there at all,
if you've abandoned us all


1149
01:20:06.280 --> 01:20:08.326
in this hell to suffer.

1150
01:20:13.505 --> 01:20:15.724
Wilder tells me you are there.

1151
01:20:17.857 --> 01:20:19.946
And that you test your servants.

1152
01:20:24.037 --> 01:20:25.691
And that this is my burden.

1153
01:20:28.911 --> 01:20:30.652
So I'm gonna do
what feels right.


1154
01:20:32.132 --> 01:20:35.483
And I'm gonna trust that,
because my blood is on fire.


1155
01:20:37.094 --> 01:20:39.705
But I ask you, Father,

1156
01:20:39.748 --> 01:20:43.491
I ask that you protect

1157
01:20:43.535 --> 01:20:47.974
what's left of my family
while I go about this.


1158
01:20:49.671 --> 01:20:52.848
I ask that you give me
the courage,


1159
01:20:52.892 --> 01:20:55.025
and the strength, and resolve...

1160
01:21:01.596 --> 01:21:02.858
to kill these bastards.

1161
01:21:09.126 --> 01:21:10.736
In your name, Father. Amen.

1162
01:21:14.305 --> 01:21:15.306
Amen.

1163
01:21:22.878 --> 01:21:24.228
Man, you gotta get a new place.

1164
01:21:24.967 --> 01:21:26.621
You don't actually bring girls
back to this thing.


1165
01:21:27.100 --> 01:21:28.797
Less than I'd like, but yeah.

1166
01:21:28.841 --> 01:21:30.277
And it's resulted in fucking?

1167
01:21:30.321 --> 01:21:31.365
More than you think.

1168
01:21:33.541 --> 01:21:34.803
Bullshit, give me that.

1169
01:21:35.195 --> 01:21:36.805
Here you go.

1170
01:21:37.197 --> 01:21:39.069
- Take that.
- Later, bro.


1171
01:21:44.987 --> 01:21:46.032
Fuck!

1172
01:21:53.213 --> 01:21:54.997
Didn't know you was trailing,
you little fucker.


1173
01:21:55.041 --> 01:21:57.478
Let's go, Cash!
You fucking cunt!


1174
01:23:01.934 --> 01:23:03.805
Fucking keys. Fuck.

1175
01:23:40.277 --> 01:23:42.192
Found the family's truck
in the woods.


1176
01:23:42.714 --> 01:23:44.019
Even left his damn keys.

1177
01:23:45.238 --> 01:23:47.371
We'll be taking care
of this in-house.


1178
01:23:48.023 --> 01:23:49.329
Anything you'd like me to do?

1179
01:23:49.764 --> 01:23:51.984
Keep this mess from getting out.

1180
01:23:52.854 --> 01:23:53.942
Will do.

1181
01:24:18.053 --> 01:24:18.924
You boys.

1182
01:24:20.055 --> 01:24:22.232
You spiraled
so far into the depths


1183
01:24:22.275 --> 01:24:24.582
of depravity that
you abandoned all


1184
01:24:24.625 --> 01:24:28.020
agreed-upon, basic courtesies,
even knocking.


1185
01:24:29.761 --> 01:24:31.415
Girl must have
a healthy appetite.


1186
01:24:33.330 --> 01:24:34.374
Nope.

1187
01:24:36.071 --> 01:24:39.945
Old Rusty.
Loves a big piece of meat.


1188
01:24:42.774 --> 01:24:45.777
Yeah. There's a boy.

1189
01:24:47.822 --> 01:24:50.172
We're past time
for messing around, Pastor.


1190
01:24:50.782 --> 01:24:52.044
Where is she?

1191
01:24:53.350 --> 01:24:54.742
I told you, she ain't here.

1192
01:24:56.004 --> 01:24:59.312
I do take issue, however,
with the murder of her father.


1193
01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:02.010
No one gives a damn
about your issue...


1194
01:25:30.865 --> 01:25:34.216
I'm gonna ask one last time.
Where's the girl?


1195
01:25:34.260 --> 01:25:35.348
Well, I'm telling ya...

1196
01:25:35.392 --> 01:25:38.482
I'm right here.
Now leave him alone.


1197
01:25:38.525 --> 01:25:39.570
No!

1198
01:25:41.223 --> 01:25:44.096
Smart girl.
She just saved your life.


1199
01:25:44.444 --> 01:25:45.445
Now you tell Cash,

1200
01:25:45.793 --> 01:25:47.665
Big Cat's willing
to make a straight trade.


1201
01:25:48.100 --> 01:25:50.711
His life for the girl's.

1202
01:26:44.678 --> 01:26:45.940
What the hell happened?

1203
01:26:46.288 --> 01:26:47.768
You didn't answer my calls.

1204
01:26:47.812 --> 01:26:49.335
My phone died. 
Where's Savannah?

1205
01:26:49.683 --> 01:26:53.165
They took her from me.
I'm sorry.


1206
01:26:53.992 --> 01:26:56.951
They wanna do a straight swap.
Your life for her life.


1207
01:27:02.435 --> 01:27:03.915
I have myself a plan.

1208
01:27:04.568 --> 01:27:06.134
You being here might change it.

1209
01:27:07.309 --> 01:27:08.223
No.

1210
01:27:09.964 --> 01:27:12.314
I think you
and I got the same idea.


1211
01:27:13.359 --> 01:27:14.578
Wanna get cleaned up?

1212
01:27:18.408 --> 01:27:20.235
Might splash some water
on my face.


1213
01:27:21.672 --> 01:27:23.413
Rather take
a clean shirt, but...


1214
01:27:26.372 --> 01:27:28.243
I like to get filthy
when I maul.


1215
01:27:51.876 --> 01:27:54.400
The most important
decision of your life right now.


1216
01:27:55.662 --> 01:27:56.707
Don't fuck it up.

1217
01:27:57.055 --> 01:27:58.056
I ain't gonna do nothing.

1218
01:27:58.535 --> 01:27:59.840
Well, then do nothing
while you're putting


1219
01:27:59.884 --> 01:28:01.059
your hands behind your back.

1220
01:28:03.061 --> 01:28:03.975
Sit!

1221
01:28:04.584 --> 01:28:06.238
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Get your ass up.


1222
01:28:06.717 --> 01:28:08.196
Zeke, we're taking you to lunch.

1223
01:28:08.240 --> 01:28:09.850
You don't know
what the fuck you're doing!


1224
01:28:09.894 --> 01:28:10.938
Sit.

1225
01:28:10.982 --> 01:28:12.113
You motherfuckers!

1226
01:28:12.592 --> 01:28:14.159
- Stay. Good boys.
- You're fucking dead! No!


1227
01:28:14.202 --> 01:28:16.161
No!

1228
01:28:16.204 --> 01:28:18.816
Don't just stand there, Susan,
fucking call somebody!


1229
01:28:18.859 --> 01:28:20.078
Don't do anything, Susan!

1230
01:28:20.121 --> 01:28:20.992
Fuck!

1231
01:28:32.133 --> 01:28:33.570
I never had a daughter.

1232
01:28:34.353 --> 01:28:39.140
I've had three sons,
but the hills took two of 'em.


1233
01:28:43.580 --> 01:28:45.320
There was an incident
at the law firm.


1234
01:28:46.191 --> 01:28:47.497
They got Zeke.

1235
01:28:54.199 --> 01:28:56.375
Zeke's phone.

1236
01:28:59.726 --> 01:29:00.597
Where's my boy, Cash?

1237
01:29:01.380 --> 01:29:03.817
Well, he's anxious
to get back under your wing.


1238
01:29:04.601 --> 01:29:05.732
Let's do a trade.

1239
01:29:06.690 --> 01:29:07.865
Trade?

1240
01:29:07.908 --> 01:29:08.866
Zeke for Savannah.

1241
01:29:09.170 --> 01:29:12.783
We meet at the rock plant,
Avenue 280.


1242
01:29:13.958 --> 01:29:15.525
Here's how this is gonna work.

1243
01:29:15.829 --> 01:29:19.529
You be at my place.
Four o'clock with Zeke.


1244
01:29:19.877 --> 01:29:22.619
You don't show,
I'll put another member


1245
01:29:22.662 --> 01:29:24.185
of your family in the ground.

1246
01:29:24.969 --> 01:29:26.144
That doesn't work for you?

1247
01:29:26.579 --> 01:29:31.584
We each dispose of our wares.
Save us both some trouble.


1248
01:29:32.672 --> 01:29:33.717
Is that clear?

1249
01:29:35.632 --> 01:29:36.720
Four p.m.

1250
01:29:40.898 --> 01:29:41.855
How'd that go?

1251
01:29:44.118 --> 01:29:45.206
Change of plan.

1252
01:29:46.468 --> 01:29:48.470
Well, that sounds encouraging.

1253
01:29:48.514 --> 01:29:50.690
Yeah, you're fucked.

1254
01:29:54.476 --> 01:29:56.348
I'm real tired of your family.

1255
01:29:59.743 --> 01:30:01.483
Keep your eye
on that little bitch.


1256
01:30:02.833 --> 01:30:03.834

Fuck!

01:31:51.768 --> 01:31:53.291
Anybody put a shot in my son

1267
01:31:53.334 --> 01:31:55.032
and you will be
on the receiving end.


1268

It's all right, baby, I'm here.

1269

Big Cat!

1270
01:32:02.648 --> 01:32:03.736
Hey, Wilder.

1271
01:32:04.041 --> 01:32:06.347
You got all mixed up in this.

1272
01:32:07.653 --> 01:32:08.872
Where's Cash?

1273
01:32:09.655 --> 01:32:13.093
Things will go smoother
if you and me make this trade.


1274
01:32:13.137 --> 01:32:14.616
Keep emotions out of it.

1275
01:32:15.530 --> 01:32:18.882
You come driving up
with my son as a hood ornament.


1276
01:32:19.534 --> 01:32:22.537
I thought you was reformed,
preacher.


1277
01:32:23.669 --> 01:32:28.674
I'm more the Old Testament type.
Eye for eye, tooth for tooth.


1278
01:32:29.283 --> 01:32:31.416
Hell, now you're speaking
my language.


1279
01:33:11.717 --> 01:33:12.674
Let my boy down.

1280
01:33:13.023 --> 01:33:14.415
I don't like seeing him
up there like that.


1281
01:33:16.156 --> 01:33:18.202
We can make the exchange
at the same time.


1282
01:33:18.724 --> 01:33:20.857
I ain't cutting him loose
till I got Savannah.


1283
01:33:21.248 --> 01:33:22.989
And I know you ain't tailing me.

1284
01:33:23.903 --> 01:33:25.905
If that happens,
I'll drop him down the road.


1285
01:33:28.908 --> 01:33:30.344
Sounds good by me.

1286
01:33:32.956 --> 01:33:33.870
Go get her.

1287
01:33:34.871 --> 01:33:36.786
When Zeke's clear, take him out.

1288
01:33:37.047 --> 01:33:39.266
We're gonna stuff
and mount these motherfuckers.


1289
01:33:39.310 --> 01:33:40.224
Make a show of it.

1290
01:33:46.534 --> 01:33:49.189
Easy now, little girl. Okay?

1291
01:33:50.234 --> 01:33:53.237
Put the gun down.
Put the fucking gun down.


1292
01:33:55.848 --> 01:33:56.806
Shit.

1293
01:33:59.809 --> 01:34:00.810
Put him down.

1294
01:34:06.293 --> 01:34:07.555
Don't fucking shoot.

1295
01:34:10.732 --> 01:34:11.908
He's behind the car!

1296
01:34:11.951 --> 01:34:13.170
Get a flank on him.

1297
01:35:10.227 --> 01:35:11.228
Shit.

1298
01:35:13.839 --> 01:35:15.014
Put a pinch on him.

1299
01:36:20.601 --> 01:36:22.342
Goddamn it, Zeke,
get out of there!


1300
01:36:46.323 --> 01:36:47.454
Zeke!

1301
01:36:49.717 --> 01:36:52.242
Zeke, get the hell out of there!

1302
01:37:09.563 --> 01:37:12.784
Stay! Stay!

1303
01:37:14.655 --> 01:37:16.005
Easy, boy.

1304
01:37:19.095 --> 01:37:20.226
Get the fuck back.

1305
01:37:23.403 --> 01:37:24.448
Zeke!

1306
01:38:02.747 --> 01:38:04.401
Hate to tell you this, Savannah,

1307
01:38:05.228 --> 01:38:06.925
but that M1 only holds
eight rounds.


1308
01:38:08.361 --> 01:38:09.928
Know how many you got left?

1309
01:38:13.018 --> 01:38:14.063
'Cause I do.

1310
01:38:15.847 --> 01:38:18.719
Damn, kid!

1311
01:38:22.897 --> 01:38:24.029
All right, game over.

1312
01:38:24.073 --> 01:38:25.596
I'm gonna
take your fucking face off.


1313
01:38:33.169 --> 01:38:34.170
Shit.

1314
01:38:38.870 --> 01:38:40.089
End of the line, little girl.

1315
01:38:59.456 --> 01:39:00.718
No, goddamn you!

1316
01:39:05.592 --> 01:39:06.941
Zeke.

1317
01:39:06.985 --> 01:39:09.901
God, Zeke, baby.

1318
01:39:11.032 --> 01:39:12.121
Baby.

1319
01:39:15.776 --> 01:39:19.824
God. I'm sorry.

1320
01:40:28.414 --> 01:40:29.285
Okay.

1321
01:41:42.358 --> 01:41:43.750
God damn you.

1322
01:41:52.368 --> 01:41:53.456
Uncle Cash!

1323
01:41:55.545 --> 01:41:59.592
Come here.
Shh. You okay? Yeah?


1324
01:42:11.865 --> 01:42:12.866
Go!

1325
01:42:14.390 --> 01:42:15.956
Uncle Cash!

1326
01:42:27.228 --> 01:42:28.317
What do I do?

1327
01:42:31.755 --> 01:42:36.629
Out that window. Keep going.
Get out of town.


1328
01:42:38.109 --> 01:42:39.763
Get out
of the whole goddamn state.


1329
01:42:39.806 --> 01:42:41.765
- No!
- Savannah. Look at me.


1330
01:42:42.809 --> 01:42:46.596
For God, for family,
and survival. Go.


1331
01:42:47.118 --> 01:42:48.206
Go now!

1332
01:42:52.776 --> 01:42:54.255
Go now!

1333
01:43:01.741 --> 01:43:02.786
Savannah, go!

1334
01:43:03.264 --> 01:43:04.570
Get the hell out!

1335
01:43:23.328 --> 01:43:25.983
You better know there's no place
on this earth I won't find her.


1336
01:43:27.637 --> 01:43:28.986
I'll see you in hell.

1337
01:43:42.956 --> 01:43:46.220
My sk...

1338
01:44:18.078 --> 01:44:19.340
Good morning, everybody.

1339
01:44:19.689 --> 01:44:20.907
Good morning.

1340
01:44:20.951 --> 01:44:22.735
I missed you.

1341
01:44:23.867 --> 01:44:26.173
It's great to see
all your bright, shining faces.


1342
01:44:27.653 --> 01:44:29.655
As you know, I haven't been here
for a few months.


1343
01:44:30.395 --> 01:44:31.918
I cut myself shaving.

1344
01:44:54.071 --> 01:44:55.638
- Want something to eat?
- You bet.


1345
01:44:57.988 --> 01:45:00.338
How I have longed
to be here with you.


1346
01:45:01.208 --> 01:45:02.340
Continue our talks

1347
01:45:03.341 --> 01:45:05.386
about the Lord's word
and the Lord's will.


1348
01:45:07.258 --> 01:45:09.695
Today's lesson
is on divine vengeance.


1349
01:45:12.524 --> 01:45:13.743
"What if the breath

1350
01:45:13.786 --> 01:45:16.267
that kindled those
grim fires, awaked,


1351
01:45:17.094 --> 01:45:19.400
should blow them
into sevenfold rage


1352
01:45:19.444 --> 01:45:21.272
and plunge us into flames?"

1353
01:45:22.360 --> 01:45:25.015
"Or from above,
should intermitted vengeance


1354
01:45:25.058 --> 01:45:27.974
arm again his red right hand
to plague us."


1355
01:45:30.847 --> 01:45:32.022
How's she doing?

1356
01:45:32.370 --> 01:45:33.502
Good.

1357
01:45:34.285 --> 01:45:35.678
