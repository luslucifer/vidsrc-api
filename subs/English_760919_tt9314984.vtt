1
00:02:25.138 --> 00:02:26.221
Oh!

2
00:02:26.221 --> 00:02:28.471
Hmph! God!

3
00:02:28.471 --> 00:02:31.305
The government
will not be blackmailed.


4
00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.971
We must ration
energy and endure these cuts


5
00:02:34.971 --> 00:02:37.763
until these radicals
accept these --


6
00:02:39.471 --> 00:02:41.346
They're only
asking what's due.


7
00:02:41.346 --> 00:02:44.013
This strike is for everyone
at the bottom of the pile.


8
00:02:44.013 --> 00:02:47.305
Everyone who is sick
of being treated to...


9
00:02:47.305 --> 00:02:49.680
Angels sent by God to guide me.

10
00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.888
Be my light and walk beside me.

11
00:02:51.888 --> 00:02:54.221
Be my guardian and protect me.

12
00:02:54.221 --> 00:02:56.680
On the paths of life direct me.

13
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.763
Morning, darlin'.

14
00:03:10.221 --> 00:03:14.721
Good morning.

15
00:03:14.721 --> 00:03:21.638
Good mornin'.

16
00:03:23.805 --> 00:03:26.346
Good morning.

17
00:03:54.055 --> 00:03:56.138
You know I think we do
it at night time,


18
00:03:56.138 --> 00:03:57.346
there's more power.

19
00:03:57.346 --> 00:03:58.555
Less of a shortage.

20
00:03:58.555 --> 00:03:59.721
What about
the generator?


21
00:03:59.721 --> 00:04:01.055
Well, that can
fill the gaps.


22
00:04:01.055 --> 00:04:03.138
East London World Radio --

23
00:04:03.138 --> 00:04:04.930
Keeping you good company.

24
00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.305
and I'm your devoted host,
DJ Mike.


25
00:04:08.305 --> 00:04:10.805
If you keep calm
and it's all...


26
00:04:13.346 --> 00:04:16.221
You've requested
Pediatrics, I see.


27
00:04:19.763 --> 00:04:22.638
Why?

28
00:04:22.638 --> 00:04:26.013
Oh. Well, I...

29
00:04:26.013 --> 00:04:28.680
I'd like to think
I have a feel for children.


30
00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.721
You need an iron will,
not a feel for them.


31
00:04:32.721 --> 00:04:34.430
How did you find
your studies?


32
00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.846
I loved it.

33
00:04:36.846 --> 00:04:39.138
It was a dream come true
to be there. This all is.


34
00:04:39.138 --> 00:04:40.888
Our borough holds
the poorest in the city.


35
00:04:40.888 --> 00:04:42.638
Why do you think
you can cope?


36
00:04:42.638 --> 00:04:44.346
Well, I'm interested
in the connections


37
00:04:44.346 --> 00:04:46.305
between poverty
and health.


38
00:04:46.305 --> 00:04:51.263
The connection is people
round here live like animals.


39
00:04:51.263 --> 00:04:53.430
And where
are you from?


40
00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.180
Around here.

41
00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.555
Back to serve
your community.


42
00:04:57.555 --> 00:04:59.096
How noble.

43
00:04:59.096 --> 00:05:01.096
I thought I'd be
most useful here.


44
00:05:01.096 --> 00:05:02.346
Accommodation?

45
00:05:02.346 --> 00:05:04.180
I'm hoping for
a place in halls.


46
00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.388
Can't you stay with family,
if you're a local?


47
00:05:06.388 --> 00:05:07.638
I don't have any.

48
00:05:07.638 --> 00:05:11.263
I grew up in
Our Lady of Grace.


49
00:05:11.263 --> 00:05:13.096
The children's home.

50
00:05:13.096 --> 00:05:14.596
Yes.

51
00:05:16.721 --> 00:05:20.721
Well, you couldn't have
picked a worse day.


52
00:05:20.721 --> 00:05:22.430
We have to move nearly
all the patients out


53
00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:24.180
because of
the cut tonight.


54
00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:25.555
It's chaos out there.

55
00:05:27.971 --> 00:05:31.471
Ideals are fine, but what
I require is discipline.


56
00:05:31.471 --> 00:05:33.680
No sitting on beds
or eating on wards.


57
00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.763
No makeup.
Hats must be upright.


58
00:05:35.763 --> 00:05:37.721
Skirts three inches
below the knee.


59
00:05:37.721 --> 00:05:40.096
If you take it shorter,
I will notice, believe me.


60
00:05:40.096 --> 00:05:41.513
I use a ruler.

61
00:05:41.513 --> 00:05:43.305
Stick to your rank,
never question an order.


62
00:05:43.305 --> 00:05:44.888
Don't even speak
to the doctors.


63
00:05:44.888 --> 00:05:46.388
They communicate
above your level.


64
00:05:46.388 --> 00:05:48.930
Yes, Matron.

65
00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:51.388
Thank you
for choosing me.


66
00:05:51.388 --> 00:05:53.138
I won't keep you
if you don't fit.


67
00:06:12.888 --> 00:06:14.680
Don't mind
old Starchy.


68
00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.513
They're a
dying breed, matrons.


69
00:06:16.513 --> 00:06:20.180
They'll cut her post soon
and she knows it.


70
00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:21.638
It's fine.

71
00:06:21.638 --> 00:06:23.555
Nurse: It is a bit of a maze,
this place,


72
00:06:23.555 --> 00:06:26.555
but the floors are color-coded,
thanks to Matron.


73
00:06:26.555 --> 00:06:29.930
Green on ground, brown,
blue, yellow on top.


74
00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:32.305
I like to think
she's got knickers to match.


75
00:06:32.305 --> 00:06:34.471
She's put you
on Gyno ward, on blue.


76
00:06:34.471 --> 00:06:35.930
Can you manage that?

77
00:06:51.055 --> 00:06:53.680
Are you ready
for the cut tonight, then?


78
00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.096
Longest one yet,
isn't it?


79
00:06:56.096 --> 00:07:00.096
I don't wanna fuss, but is it
gonna be much longer?


80
00:07:00.096 --> 00:07:01.513
What would
happen to the health service?


81
00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:13.930
Won't be long now,
I'm sure.


82
00:07:29.888 --> 00:07:31.180
What you doing?

83
00:07:39.638 --> 00:07:41.221
I thought you
were on the Pill?


84
00:07:41.221 --> 00:07:43.346
I told you, it just makes
them think you're loose.


85
00:07:43.346 --> 00:07:45.430
Can we stop
talking about it?


86
00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:48.346
That's the new girl.

87
00:07:48.346 --> 00:07:50.388
Hey!

88
00:07:50.388 --> 00:07:53.221
Hello?

89
00:07:53.221 --> 00:07:55.638
What was it like,
in Our Lady's?


90
00:07:55.638 --> 00:07:57.263
Terry,
she's just sat down.


91
00:07:57.263 --> 00:07:59.930
I know nuns.

92
00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:01.680
I bet it was
the pits, wasn't it?


93
00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:03.096
You poor lamb.

94
00:08:03.096 --> 00:08:05.846
I don't think
about it much.
Ignore her.


95
00:08:05.846 --> 00:08:09.055
You'll find speaking your mind
is not popular around here, Val.


96
00:08:09.055 --> 00:08:10.596
Speaking of which,

97
00:08:10.596 --> 00:08:12.346
are you coming to
the union meeting tomorrow?


98
00:08:12.346 --> 00:08:16.138
Wake up. They're never gonna
listen to a bunch of girls.


99
00:08:16.138 --> 00:08:18.138
That's the point
of a union, Terry.


100
00:08:18.138 --> 00:08:20.680
You're the one always moaning
about working in the dark.


101
00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:25.096
What's it like here, then?
When the power's out?


102
00:08:25.096 --> 00:08:26.805
A place people die in

103
00:08:26.805 --> 00:08:29.971
should never be allowed
to get that dark.


104
00:08:29.971 --> 00:08:32.221
There you go, again, see?
Moaning.


105
00:08:32.221 --> 00:08:34.430
I'm not moaning.
I'm telling the truth.


106
00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:18.055
Oh.

107
00:09:18.055 --> 00:09:19.555
This toilet's for nurses.

108
00:09:20.805 --> 00:09:22.305
Come out, please.

109
00:09:27.846 --> 00:09:31.555
Oh, no,
not that way.


110
00:09:31.555 --> 00:09:34.180
That's the way out.

111
00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:36.846
Yes, come on.

112
00:09:36.846 --> 00:09:39.763
You need looking after,
don't you?


113
00:09:39.763 --> 00:09:43.138
Goodness. You'll
catch your death.


114
00:09:59.305 --> 00:10:02.971
Excuse me, Doctor.

115
00:10:02.971 --> 00:10:04.263
You have a runaway.

116
00:10:04.263 --> 00:10:05.805
Saba.

117
00:10:05.805 --> 00:10:07.596
Now, how are we supposed
to get you better


118
00:10:07.596 --> 00:10:09.513
if you keep running off?

119
00:10:09.513 --> 00:10:11.680
Go on. Back to your bed.

120
00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:22.305
Are you
Doctor Franklin?


121
00:10:22.305 --> 00:10:25.763
Yes.

122
00:10:25.763 --> 00:10:28.221
I saw you
give your paper.


123
00:10:28.221 --> 00:10:29.721
I agree
with every word.


124
00:10:29.721 --> 00:10:33.221
Slums kill children.
They're the disease.


125
00:10:33.221 --> 00:10:34.971
The truth isn't
always popular.


126
00:10:34.971 --> 00:10:36.180
The thought of doing
work like yours


127
00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:39.930
got me through
my training.


128
00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:41.346
Matron.

129
00:10:41.346 --> 00:10:42.971
I not meant
to talk to you.


130
00:10:42.971 --> 00:10:45.138
Matron, I was wondering
if we might have this girl


131
00:10:45.138 --> 00:10:47.263
up here with us
today.


132
00:10:47.263 --> 00:10:48.930
She's needed elsewhere, Doctor.

133
00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:51.763
Yes well, I rather think
that I need her here.


134
00:10:51.763 --> 00:10:53.930
Very well, Doctor.

135
00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:55.221
Let's have a listen,
eh?


136
00:11:02.138 --> 00:11:03.805
Mm.

137
00:11:03.805 --> 00:11:05.680
Still not
fully cleared.


138
00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:07.221
And no weight gain.

139
00:11:07.221 --> 00:11:08.388
What do you think?

140
00:11:08.388 --> 00:11:11.305
Oh, I couldn't say.

141
00:11:11.305 --> 00:11:12.555
I'm asking you to.

142
00:11:20.138 --> 00:11:22.971
How about that
nasty brown cod liver?


143
00:11:22.971 --> 00:11:24.596
Are you swallowing
it all down?


144
00:11:24.596 --> 00:11:27.430
You're not just pretending,
are you?


145
00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:30.513
Well, she's got rickets
as well, hasn't she?


146
00:11:30.513 --> 00:11:32.596
Yes, I think so.

147
00:11:32.596 --> 00:11:34.555
She's getting cod liver,
isn't she, Matron?


148
00:11:34.555 --> 00:11:36.763
I'll check with Sister.

149
00:11:36.763 --> 00:11:38.805
She's certainly not
well enough to go home.


150
00:11:38.805 --> 00:11:41.180
We'll send her
to Central tonight, with me.


151
00:11:45.846 --> 00:11:49.305
Don't worry.
I'll keep her away from you.


152
00:11:49.305 --> 00:11:50.846
Is she one of
your case studies?


153
00:11:50.846 --> 00:11:53.096
Yes, yes, and the building
that she was in.


154
00:11:53.096 --> 00:11:54.555
I've had several
from there.


155
00:11:54.555 --> 00:11:56.346
You haven't had any visitors
either, have you?


156
00:11:56.346 --> 00:11:57.638
Franklin?

157
00:11:57.638 --> 00:12:00.180
Ah, it's like
I never left school.


158
00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:01.930
You might want to
check her bed.


159
00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:03.221
Sir?

160
00:12:03.221 --> 00:12:05.596
Three congenital
heart diseases.


161
00:12:05.596 --> 00:12:08.138
Um, Ebstein's anomaly.

162
00:12:08.138 --> 00:12:11.555
Come on, man,
pathetic. Faster.


163
00:12:11.555 --> 00:12:15.055
I used to wet the bed
sometimes.


164
00:12:15.055 --> 00:12:18.138
Even as a big girl.

165
00:12:18.138 --> 00:12:19.555
Do you speak
any English, dear?


166
00:12:19.555 --> 00:12:20.763
Little.

167
00:12:20.763 --> 00:12:23.680
How old are you?

168
00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:25.721
13?

169
00:12:25.721 --> 00:12:26.971
You're a little thing.

170
00:12:26.971 --> 00:12:29.513
You come with me
tonight?


171
00:12:29.513 --> 00:12:33.346
To Central?
I'm not working tonight.


172
00:12:36.513 --> 00:12:38.430
I'm a bit scared
of her, too,


173
00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:40.055
but just be good and
do as you're told


174
00:12:40.055 --> 00:12:41.346
and you'll be fine.

175
00:13:08.305 --> 00:13:11.096
Franklin, can we please
get on with it?


176
00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:22.471
I have served this institution
for many years.


177
00:13:22.471 --> 00:13:25.805
The authority I have here
is hard-won, believe me.


178
00:13:25.805 --> 00:13:28.263
And you undermine it
in public on your first day?


179
00:13:28.263 --> 00:13:30.055
I'm so sorry,
Matron.


180
00:13:30.055 --> 00:13:31.513
I really didn't mean
for all that to happen.


181
00:13:31.513 --> 00:13:33.680
Do you understand
you are on trial?


182
00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:36.013
Or did you only come
to flutter your eyelashes?


183
00:13:36.013 --> 00:13:41.513
Yes. No.

184
00:13:41.513 --> 00:13:43.888
Clean this ward.

185
00:13:43.888 --> 00:13:46.138
From top to bottom.

186
00:13:46.138 --> 00:13:48.138
And I need a girl
for tonight.


187
00:13:48.138 --> 00:13:50.263
You will stay on.

188
00:13:50.263 --> 00:13:51.638
The dark shift?

189
00:13:53.971 --> 00:13:56.846
Oh, I can't.
I'm not ready.


190
00:13:56.846 --> 00:13:58.055
Does the dark
bother you?


191
00:13:58.055 --> 00:14:00.096
Well,
it's just I...


192
00:14:00.096 --> 00:14:02.055
Hm?

193
00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:08.638
A nurse must give
of herself entirely.


194
00:14:08.638 --> 00:14:10.680
Sacrifice.

195
00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:12.096
How much
are you willing to give?


196
00:16:46.513 --> 00:16:48.013
Hello again.

197
00:16:50.138 --> 00:16:52.013
Are you
staying on tonight?


198
00:16:52.013 --> 00:16:54.930
Yeah. Must be
my lucky day.


199
00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:57.013
She got you back, then.

200
00:16:57.013 --> 00:16:58.555
Oh, dear.

201
00:16:58.555 --> 00:17:01.388
I feel
rather responsible.


202
00:17:01.388 --> 00:17:03.388
It was my fault,
really, but,


203
00:17:03.388 --> 00:17:05.596
us doctors tend
to get away with it.


204
00:17:05.596 --> 00:17:07.721
Oh, well.
In for a penny.


205
00:17:07.721 --> 00:17:09.013
You're a saint.

206
00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:15.721
Oh, I never
caught your name.


207
00:17:15.721 --> 00:17:17.013
Valerie.

208
00:17:42.888 --> 00:17:45.680
I won't have Central
lord it over us.


209
00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:47.680
Just tell me, am I
on the schedule?


210
00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:49.680
Nurse: We're on
the schedule, sir.


211
00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:51.596
Would any remaining staff

212
00:17:51.596 --> 00:17:54.096
please make their way
to the main entrance.


213
00:17:54.096 --> 00:17:58.305
Final transport to Central
is about to depart.


214
00:17:58.305 --> 00:18:00.055
The only ward
left here tonight


215
00:18:00.055 --> 00:18:02.805
is Antenatal
and Intensive Care.


216
00:18:02.805 --> 00:18:04.888
Generators will
power them.


217
00:18:04.888 --> 00:18:08.180
You will be on
Intensive Care.


218
00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:10.555
Stay on the ward
unless essential.


219
00:18:10.555 --> 00:18:12.055
It'll be very dark.

220
00:18:15.471 --> 00:18:17.180
That's it from me.

221
00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:19.721
I'll be back with the power
at 7:00 AM.


222
00:18:19.721 --> 00:18:22.221
Take good care tonight,
stay safe,


223
00:18:22.221 --> 00:18:23.721
and stay near that candle.

224
00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:50.680
Oh --
that's too early.


225
00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:57.471
Isn't that too early?

226
00:20:55.888 --> 00:20:58.013
Hello?

227
00:21:02.221 --> 00:21:03.805
Oh.

228
00:21:25.805 --> 00:21:28.013
Wow.
Bloody hell.


229
00:21:28.013 --> 00:21:29.263
Hello, dear.

230
00:21:29.263 --> 00:21:30.555
You looking for us?

231
00:21:30.555 --> 00:21:31.805
Am I on the wrong level?

232
00:21:31.805 --> 00:21:34.221
You're on shite level.
You want piss.


233
00:21:34.221 --> 00:21:37.680
You're on brown, dear.
You want yellow.


234
00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:39.930
You made
my heart stop.


235
00:21:39.930 --> 00:21:43.305
Stop reading that nonsense,
then you wouldn't be so jumpy.


236
00:21:43.305 --> 00:21:45.388
They're
not nonsense.


237
00:21:45.388 --> 00:21:47.430
This one's about a girl
who has enough


238
00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:49.346
and brings
the whole place down.


239
00:21:49.346 --> 00:21:51.013
Can you see
why I like it?


240
00:21:51.013 --> 00:21:53.263
Nursing really
isn't her calling.


241
00:21:53.263 --> 00:21:55.971
Try telling
my ma that.


242
00:21:55.971 --> 00:21:58.138
Do you know how to
get up there?


243
00:21:58.138 --> 00:22:00.846
I'll take you then,
before this one ruins you.


244
00:22:00.846 --> 00:22:03.180
Innocent new girl,
Terry.


245
00:22:13.263 --> 00:22:17.180
What about you, then?
What brings you to nursing?


246
00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:19.596
Oh.

247
00:22:19.596 --> 00:22:25.971
I suppose, working
with people who care.


248
00:22:25.971 --> 00:22:30.721
I thought it might be a bit
like a big, kind of...


249
00:22:30.721 --> 00:22:32.138
family.

250
00:22:32.138 --> 00:22:33.888
Jesus.

251
00:22:33.888 --> 00:22:37.221
You'd have to be desperate
to want this lot as family.


252
00:22:42.138 --> 00:22:43.680
What's wrong
with the babies?


253
00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:45.596
Oh no, it's
the mothers that are sick


254
00:22:45.596 --> 00:22:46.846
after the birth.

255
00:22:46.846 --> 00:22:48.846
They just need
milk and cuddles.


256
00:22:48.846 --> 00:22:51.930
You worked here long?Ugh, years.

257
00:22:51.930 --> 00:22:53.930
I like it
well enough, but


258
00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:56.013
prefer to have been
a doctor sometimes,


259
00:22:56.013 --> 00:23:00.430
but eh,
another life.


260
00:23:00.430 --> 00:23:02.346
Look, you seem like
a sweet girl, Valerie,


261
00:23:02.346 --> 00:23:05.305
but there's always someone
trying to control you


262
00:23:05.305 --> 00:23:06.513
in a place
like this.


263
00:23:06.513 --> 00:23:09.305
You have to stop it
first day,


264
00:23:09.305 --> 00:23:11.930
or it's the start
of trouble, right?


265
00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:13.388
Thank you,
Comfort.


266
00:23:56.180 --> 00:23:57.721
Did I say
you could touch?


267
00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:04.971
Valerie.
Barbara.


268
00:24:04.971 --> 00:24:07.180
I thought I saw you.God, don't.

269
00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:08.430
I feel like
I'm back in school.


270
00:24:08.430 --> 00:24:10.346
It's Babs these days.

271
00:24:10.346 --> 00:24:14.013
You're not the trainee,
are you?


272
00:24:14.013 --> 00:24:16.596
And it's Val now.

273
00:24:16.596 --> 00:24:19.930
Dirty brown,
all scrubbed up.


274
00:24:19.930 --> 00:24:21.513
Well, well.

275
00:24:28.805 --> 00:24:32.221
Pressure, respiration,
temperature. That's it.


276
00:24:32.221 --> 00:24:35.805
Over and over again.
It's deadly boring, this ward.


277
00:24:35.805 --> 00:24:38.513
Patients
can't even talk.


278
00:24:38.513 --> 00:24:40.471
Do you like
talking to them, too?


279
00:24:40.471 --> 00:24:43.805
No. All they go on
about is being ill.


280
00:24:43.805 --> 00:24:45.263
It's just more fun.

281
00:24:45.263 --> 00:24:46.971
Like if they say,
"Any tea going, nurse?"


282
00:24:46.971 --> 00:24:50.346
And I say, "Greedy guts,
you've just had it."


283
00:24:50.346 --> 00:24:52.888
Even if they've not.

284
00:24:56.388 --> 00:24:59.596
They can open,
but they can't see a thing.


285
00:24:59.596 --> 00:25:02.596
They don't teach you half of it
in college, believe you me.


286
00:25:35.471 --> 00:25:37.805
You look nice,
Babs.


287
00:25:37.805 --> 00:25:39.305
You look
just the same.


288
00:25:45.138 --> 00:25:47.888
What is that smell?

289
00:25:47.888 --> 00:25:50.305
It's like
it's following me.


290
00:25:50.305 --> 00:25:52.638
Still making yourself
an easy target.


291
00:25:52.638 --> 00:25:54.263
You're too much.

292
00:25:54.263 --> 00:25:58.721
No, really, it's like
burning or something.


293
00:26:01.638 --> 00:26:04.471
All you lot from
Our Lady's were easy.


294
00:26:04.471 --> 00:26:06.846
We were rotten to you,
really, weren't we?


295
00:26:06.846 --> 00:26:09.471
It was the teachers'
fault, mind.


296
00:26:09.471 --> 00:26:11.096
They were worse.

297
00:26:13.055 --> 00:26:15.096
Does your mother
still run the pub?


298
00:26:15.096 --> 00:26:18.221
She says I'm lucky as a princess
to have this job.


299
00:26:18.221 --> 00:26:20.638
She should come and clean
up shit and sick all day.


300
00:26:20.638 --> 00:26:22.680
I tell you sometimes,
I'm that desperate.


301
00:26:26.055 --> 00:26:28.263
Anyway, I'll be
married soon.


302
00:26:28.263 --> 00:26:30.846
In a proper house,
further out.


303
00:26:30.846 --> 00:26:33.013
Engaged, are you?
I will be.


304
00:26:40.805 --> 00:26:42.388
Seen any doctors
you like?


305
00:26:42.388 --> 00:26:44.180
I'm here
for a career.


306
00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:46.805
Really?

307
00:26:46.805 --> 00:26:48.930
I heard the new girl
was all over Franklin.


308
00:26:48.930 --> 00:26:51.638
That's not true.
Well, he's taken.

309
00:26:51.638 --> 00:26:55.013
He's sweet on me.

310
00:26:55.013 --> 00:26:57.138
Anyway,
with your reputation...


311
00:27:02.055 --> 00:27:04.638
Bloody generator.

312
00:27:05.888 --> 00:27:07.263
Well, what about
the patients?


313
00:27:07.263 --> 00:27:10.596
Back up batteries
for now, silly.


314
00:27:12.763 --> 00:27:14.971
Never want
the generations down.


315
00:27:14.971 --> 00:27:18.388
No, come up,
you lazy sod.


316
00:27:22.763 --> 00:27:25.305
Oh, wait --
Babs, that's my light.


317
00:27:25.305 --> 00:27:27.013
I don't know
where yours is.


318
00:27:42.471 --> 00:27:45.555
Cerebrovascular accident.

319
00:27:45.555 --> 00:27:48.638
History of aneurysm,
seven years.


320
00:27:48.638 --> 00:27:51.930
Childbirths, nine live.

321
00:29:11.555 --> 00:29:14.888
Ahh!

322
00:29:26.596 --> 00:29:28.055
Who did that?

323
00:29:42.971 --> 00:29:45.721
Imagine making up
something like that.


324
00:29:45.721 --> 00:29:47.180
Everyone heard
about it.


325
00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:50.055
The whole neighborhood.

326
00:29:50.055 --> 00:29:52.721
So it ended up
"dirty brown."


327
00:29:52.721 --> 00:29:58.013
Dirt sticks,
don't it?


328
00:29:58.013 --> 00:29:59.305
What's up with you?

329
00:29:59.305 --> 00:30:00.513
Did you
pull me over?


330
00:30:00.513 --> 00:30:03.471
How could I?
You weirdo.


331
00:30:13.513 --> 00:30:16.346
Alright?

332
00:30:16.346 --> 00:30:17.721
Name's Nev.

333
00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:23.138
Did you
take a tumble?


334
00:30:23.138 --> 00:30:25.555
Yeah.

335
00:30:25.555 --> 00:30:26.971
It'll be alright,
girl.


336
00:30:29.971 --> 00:30:33.096
Something there,
though.


337
00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:52.638
Spick, is it?

338
00:30:52.638 --> 00:30:55.346
Tell me you're not.
Your looks.


339
00:30:55.346 --> 00:30:56.555
I don't know.

340
00:30:56.555 --> 00:30:59.805
Ah, yeah.
Our Lady's girl.


341
00:30:59.805 --> 00:31:02.388
Don't you know
your folks, then?


342
00:31:02.388 --> 00:31:04.221
Well, you've come
out of it alright.


343
00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:11.346
Dark getting to you,
was it?


344
00:31:11.346 --> 00:31:13.055
Mind you, a night with
the Angel of Death over there,


345
00:31:13.055 --> 00:31:14.430
that'll get to anyone.

346
00:31:18.221 --> 00:31:19.721
You can use my lamp,
if you want.


347
00:31:19.721 --> 00:31:21.180
Oh, really?

348
00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:22.805
It's the brightest
they've got.


349
00:31:22.805 --> 00:31:24.346
Always lit up, me.

350
00:31:24.346 --> 00:31:26.055
Yeah, no, and mine's
not up to much.


351
00:31:26.055 --> 00:31:28.930
'Course.
I don't mind the dark.


352
00:31:28.930 --> 00:31:31.305
I love
working nights.


353
00:31:31.305 --> 00:31:35.013
You can get up to
all sorts.


354
00:32:58.971 --> 00:33:02.555
I can take her down
a peg or two.


355
00:33:02.555 --> 00:33:06.596
Anytime.
Just ask Nev.


356
00:33:33.221 --> 00:33:35.513
Enjoy that, did you?

357
00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:41.096
Are you okay?

358
00:33:43.096 --> 00:33:45.221
Never let them get anything
on you in here.


359
00:33:49.055 --> 00:33:50.680
We're screwed.

360
00:33:57.930 --> 00:33:59.555
Made you tea.

361
00:34:03.346 --> 00:34:05.055
Why are you
being nice to me?


362
00:34:05.055 --> 00:34:07.680
Thanks.

363
00:34:09.180 --> 00:34:13.596
That's what nurses do,
isn't it?


364
00:34:13.596 --> 00:34:16.763
Look after people,
whoever they are.


365
00:34:16.763 --> 00:34:19.763
Whoever they are.

366
00:34:19.763 --> 00:34:21.721
I didn't mean it
like that.


367
00:34:21.721 --> 00:34:24.430
How do you have the nerve
to act high and mighty?


368
00:34:30.138 --> 00:34:33.096
Why did you make
that stuff up?


369
00:34:34.721 --> 00:34:37.596
It's a pity you couldn't
keep your mouth shut, then.


370
00:34:37.596 --> 00:34:38.971
That poor man.

371
00:34:44.555 --> 00:34:48.805
Let's be friends, Babs.
We're grown-ups now.


372
00:34:54.263 --> 00:34:58.638
Run downstairs
and get some med charts.


373
00:34:58.638 --> 00:35:00.680
We've ran out.

374
00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:02.346
Matron said
not to go off the ward.


375
00:35:02.346 --> 00:35:05.721
Unless vital.

376
00:35:05.721 --> 00:35:09.096
What would she say if I tell her
you refused an order?


377
00:35:12.013 --> 00:35:14.430
Go on, then.

378
00:35:14.430 --> 00:35:16.763
Bit of dark
won't hurt you.


379
00:37:10.138 --> 00:37:13.971
Oh!

380
00:37:13.971 --> 00:37:15.346
What you doing?

381
00:37:18.263 --> 00:37:20.638
My job.

382
00:37:20.638 --> 00:37:24.721
Locking the exits.

383
00:37:24.721 --> 00:37:27.805
Don't want any
unsavory types getting in.


384
00:37:27.805 --> 00:37:29.013
How do we get out,
then?


385
00:37:29.013 --> 00:37:30.471
Ask me.

386
00:37:30.471 --> 00:37:35.471
Going in this ward?
I'll walk you.


387
00:37:35.471 --> 00:37:37.763
Go yourself,
if you'd prefer.


388
00:38:08.263 --> 00:38:10.971
Hang on.
This is my room.


389
00:38:10.971 --> 00:38:13.971
I need to get
some fuel for the...


390
00:38:17.388 --> 00:38:20.763
Come in.
I wanna show you something.


391
00:38:36.430 --> 00:38:38.888
My famous
league table.


392
00:38:38.888 --> 00:38:41.180
Most of you girls
are up.


393
00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:45.638
The docs love it.

394
00:38:45.638 --> 00:38:47.430
Don't know
about you yet.


395
00:38:47.430 --> 00:38:51.846
Maybe a 7,
if you smiled a bit more.


396
00:38:51.846 --> 00:38:53.305
I need to get on.

397
00:38:53.305 --> 00:38:56.263
Come in,
then I'll walk you.


398
00:38:56.263 --> 00:38:59.513
Go on.
Come in, be a laugh.


399
00:38:59.513 --> 00:39:03.305
No, thank you.

400
00:39:03.305 --> 00:39:05.305
What do you think
I'm gonna do to you?


401
00:39:07.221 --> 00:39:09.388
Bye, then.

402
00:39:12.346 --> 00:39:15.263
I wouldn't bother,
love!


403
00:39:15.263 --> 00:39:17.305
You're soiled goods
anyway!


404
00:41:17.638 --> 00:41:20.138
Hello?

405
00:41:45.596 --> 00:41:47.971
Hello?

406
00:42:33.846 --> 00:42:35.846
Ahh!

407
00:42:39.138 --> 00:42:41.305
Get off me, stop it, stop it!

408
00:42:41.305 --> 00:42:44.680
Get off me! Stop, stop, stop!

409
00:43:32.430 --> 00:43:34.513
Babs?

410
00:43:40.805 --> 00:43:43.971
Babs?

411
00:43:49.180 --> 00:43:51.471
Babs?

412
00:44:03.930 --> 00:44:06.846
Hello?Babs isn't here.

413
00:44:06.846 --> 00:44:09.180
Babs?

414
00:44:09.180 --> 00:44:11.305
Val.

415
00:44:11.305 --> 00:44:13.846
Val?

416
00:44:13.846 --> 00:44:17.138
Val, what's wrong?

417
00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:42.471
Jesus.

418
00:44:45.721 --> 00:44:51.721
It's the cleanest one,
I'm afraid.


419
00:45:06.763 --> 00:45:08.221
Was it something
to do with Babs?


420
00:45:08.221 --> 00:45:11.888
Is that why
she's not here?


421
00:45:11.888 --> 00:45:13.680
Come on, now,
say something.


422
00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:16.555
We have patients to think
about as well, remember?


423
00:45:20.513 --> 00:45:25.263
I was...

424
00:45:25.263 --> 00:45:27.680
attacked.

425
00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:29.555
By who? Where?

426
00:45:29.555 --> 00:45:31.721
Something chased me
to the basement.


427
00:45:31.721 --> 00:45:34.388
What, some thing?Some one.

428
00:45:34.388 --> 00:45:37.096
Did you
see his face?


429
00:45:37.096 --> 00:45:38.846
It was too dark.

430
00:45:38.846 --> 00:45:41.263
Anything?Really, I didn't.

431
00:45:41.263 --> 00:45:45.805
It's your duty as a nurse
to say something.


432
00:45:45.805 --> 00:45:47.721
When I looked,
there was no one there.


433
00:45:51.346 --> 00:45:52.971
Are you just
making this up?


434
00:45:52.971 --> 00:45:55.013
I'm sorry Val,
but I've heard a few things.


435
00:45:55.013 --> 00:45:56.430
No, I'm not making it up.

436
00:45:56.430 --> 00:45:57.805
I know how it sounds, I do,

437
00:45:57.805 --> 00:46:00.596
but it's been
following me all night.


438
00:46:00.596 --> 00:46:03.055
Maybe tonight was too much for
you to handle for a first shift.


439
00:46:03.055 --> 00:46:05.263
Maybe you should go
home and rest.


440
00:46:05.263 --> 00:46:07.013
Matron will never have me back
if I leave.


441
00:46:07.013 --> 00:46:09.221
I'll be finished.

442
00:46:16.971 --> 00:46:20.596
Maybe you're right,
maybe I did imagine it.


443
00:46:20.596 --> 00:46:23.180
Well, why were you in
such a state, then?


444
00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:24.846
I'm not very good
with the dark.


445
00:46:24.846 --> 00:46:28.055
So you agree, then?
You imagined it.


446
00:46:28.055 --> 00:46:31.013
Nothing really
happened to you.


447
00:46:37.096 --> 00:46:38.555
Nothing happened.

448
00:46:43.596 --> 00:46:46.263
What was that?

449
00:46:46.263 --> 00:46:49.555
Hello?
Is somebody there?


450
00:47:02.346 --> 00:47:05.096
Comfort?

451
00:47:11.846 --> 00:47:15.638
Look what the cat dragged in.
Thieving milk, no less.


452
00:47:22.846 --> 00:47:25.346
Yes, no fuss. Bed.

453
00:47:32.846 --> 00:47:35.138
Whatever that was,
it was rude.


454
00:47:35.138 --> 00:47:36.680
Alright.

455
00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:38.680
Do you want to die,
young madam?


456
00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:41.221
You are sick, and we have
the medicine and food.


457
00:47:41.221 --> 00:47:44.180
If you want us
to care for you, behave.


458
00:47:53.888 --> 00:47:55.263
Will you look
at that?


459
00:47:55.263 --> 00:47:57.555
Snow White has a way
with the animals.


460
00:48:00.555 --> 00:48:02.721
They are right.

461
00:48:02.721 --> 00:48:05.055
You mustn't keep
running away like this.


462
00:48:07.096 --> 00:48:08.805
Is that why you
got left behind?


463
00:48:17.305 --> 00:48:19.805
Look at this.

464
00:48:19.805 --> 00:48:22.055
Nice, isn't she?

465
00:48:22.055 --> 00:48:25.346
And if you open her up,
there's another girl inside.


466
00:48:25.346 --> 00:48:26.971
And another.

467
00:48:36.388 --> 00:48:38.221
Oh.

468
00:48:38.221 --> 00:48:40.430
You like drawing,
don't you?


469
00:48:40.430 --> 00:48:42.013
Can I have a look?

470
00:49:02.888 --> 00:49:05.430
Why do you keep
running away, Saba?


471
00:49:05.430 --> 00:49:07.096
Are you scared
of something?


472
00:49:07.096 --> 00:49:10.430
Val, what would
Matron say?


473
00:49:10.430 --> 00:49:11.971
Don't get
too attached.


474
00:49:11.971 --> 00:49:13.721
Checks, please.

475
00:49:29.763 --> 00:49:33.388
Not much longer
with the patient,


476
00:49:33.388 --> 00:49:35.930
than we can --

477
00:49:40.805 --> 00:49:42.846
And I'll bet
that's Stan and Neville,


478
00:49:42.846 --> 00:49:44.305
and that'll be why
he hasn't answered.


479
00:49:44.305 --> 00:49:46.680
Those two are as
thick as thieves.


480
00:49:46.680 --> 00:49:48.805
They're thick alright,
I'll give you that much.


481
00:49:50.180 --> 00:49:53.721
Had too many
biscuits.


482
00:50:19.388 --> 00:50:21.388
Nothing happened.

483
00:51:14.388 --> 00:51:16.263
Val?

484
00:51:20.180 --> 00:51:21.846
Comfort!

485
00:51:31.763 --> 00:51:33.013
Val?

486
00:51:33.013 --> 00:51:35.471
Oh!

487
00:51:46.138 --> 00:51:49.221
Val, it's okay.

488
00:51:50.846 --> 00:51:53.221
Val? Alright.

489
00:51:53.221 --> 00:51:56.763
Hey, hey,
can you hear me?


490
00:51:56.763 --> 00:51:58.971
Val?
Val, listen to me!


491
00:52:20.138 --> 00:52:21.596
What's happening?

492
00:52:26.930 --> 00:52:28.180
Are you epileptic?

493
00:52:28.180 --> 00:52:30.138
That is not
what that was.


494
00:52:30.138 --> 00:52:32.680
Have you ever
had a psychosis, or...


495
00:52:32.680 --> 00:52:34.846
No.

496
00:52:34.846 --> 00:52:37.221
I'm just normal.
Ha!


497
00:52:37.221 --> 00:52:42.180
I'm gonna have to
call for more help.


498
00:52:42.180 --> 00:52:44.680
Nothing's ever
happened here before,


499
00:52:44.680 --> 00:52:47.055
and then you come
and all hell breaks out.


500
00:52:57.013 --> 00:52:58.596
That wasn't
there before.


501
00:53:04.263 --> 00:53:06.096
Terry,
where are you going?


502
00:53:06.096 --> 00:53:07.805
I don't like it.
What...?


503
00:53:07.805 --> 00:53:09.263
It's not --
it's not right.


504
00:53:09.263 --> 00:53:11.513
Terry, you can't
leave your post!


505
00:53:11.513 --> 00:53:12.846
They will sack you!

506
00:53:12.846 --> 00:53:15.513
Sorry Comfort,
but screw the lot of you.


507
00:53:15.513 --> 00:53:17.180
The door's locked!

508
00:53:17.180 --> 00:53:18.638
I know a window.

509
00:53:18.638 --> 00:53:20.013
I'm away from here,
right now.


510
00:53:20.013 --> 00:53:22.346
Terry, you can't
leave me alone!


511
00:53:22.346 --> 00:53:23.888
Terry!

512
00:53:23.888 --> 00:53:26.263
Saba, I don't want
you near her.


513
00:53:35.388 --> 00:53:36.721
I shouldn't go.

514
00:53:36.721 --> 00:53:38.805
I know how much
you wanted this,


515
00:53:38.805 --> 00:53:42.096
but I'm telling you,
you should.


516
00:53:42.096 --> 00:53:45.388
Comfort, something
did happen to me.


517
00:53:45.388 --> 00:53:47.096
I just pretended
it didn't.


518
00:53:47.096 --> 00:53:50.471
Look at the bruises
on my neck, can't you see?


519
00:53:50.471 --> 00:53:53.805
There's nothing there.
You're okay.


520
00:53:59.138 --> 00:54:00.596
I'll just
say goodbye.


521
00:54:00.596 --> 00:54:03.805
No, you'll only
make it worse.


522
00:54:03.805 --> 00:54:07.138
Do as you're told
and leave.


523
00:54:39.221 --> 00:54:42.430
Oh!
What have you done?


524
00:54:42.430 --> 00:54:45.055
Ahh! Let me go!

525
00:54:45.055 --> 00:54:46.346
I want to go home!

526
00:55:45.513 --> 00:55:49.346
Saba?

527
00:55:49.346 --> 00:55:53.096
Saba?

528
00:56:01.180 --> 00:56:03.055
Saba, run!

529
00:56:15.013 --> 00:56:17.263
Saba!
- Val?


530
00:56:17.263 --> 00:56:19.596
Saba!

531
00:56:19.596 --> 00:56:22.055
Val!

532
00:56:22.055 --> 00:56:27.346
Saba?

533
00:56:27.346 --> 00:56:28.680
Saba!

534
00:56:28.680 --> 00:56:30.180
Val?

535
00:56:58.138 --> 00:57:04.138
Yeah, but nothing
like the chaos here, I tell you.


536
00:57:04.138 --> 00:57:05.471
Let's just
say she's...


537
00:57:05.471 --> 00:57:09.471
You shouldn't
be near me.


538
00:57:09.471 --> 00:57:12.680
Well, what's wrong
with you? Go!


539
00:57:12.680 --> 00:57:15.555
Oh, wait.

540
00:57:15.555 --> 00:57:17.346
I'm sorry.

541
00:57:23.221 --> 00:57:27.096
What have you
got there?


542
00:57:33.221 --> 00:57:34.846
Who is she?

543
00:57:34.846 --> 00:57:39.555
Dirty. Gail.

544
00:57:39.555 --> 00:57:42.138
What does she want?

545
00:57:42.138 --> 00:57:46.763
Bad thing
will happen to me.


546
00:58:00.805 --> 00:58:02.721
How are you
still awake?


547
00:58:02.721 --> 00:58:04.513
I gave you enough
to knock out a grown man.


548
00:58:04.513 --> 00:58:06.180
Who's Gail?
Go back
to your bed.


549
00:58:06.180 --> 00:58:07.721
Who is Dirty Gail?

550
00:58:07.721 --> 00:58:12.596
Oh.

551
00:58:12.596 --> 00:58:13.930
What are you doing?

552
00:58:13.930 --> 00:58:16.305
I'm increasing
your dose.
No.


553
00:58:16.305 --> 00:58:19.096
Gail is the one
that's doing all this.


554
00:58:19.096 --> 00:58:22.596
Why would I hurt
myself so badly?


555
00:58:22.596 --> 00:58:24.471
Maybe you've
latched onto her


556
00:58:24.471 --> 00:58:26.305
because she was from
Our Lady's, like you.


557
00:58:26.305 --> 00:58:28.263
And if you're thinking
she's haunting you,


558
00:58:28.263 --> 00:58:29.513
let me stop you
right there.


559
00:58:29.513 --> 00:58:31.805
She didn't die.
She ran away.


560
00:58:31.805 --> 00:58:34.430
She was destructive.
She lashed out.


561
00:58:34.430 --> 00:58:38.513
She was a very angry child,
very hard to like.


562
00:58:38.513 --> 00:58:40.096
She was just
a rotten apple.


563
00:58:40.096 --> 00:58:42.555
Do you remember
the dog?


564
00:58:42.555 --> 00:58:44.471
What, that filthy,
purple thing?


565
00:58:44.471 --> 00:58:46.138
Yeah.
Well, she...


566
00:58:46.138 --> 00:58:47.721
Yeah, we tried to
take it off her,


567
00:58:47.721 --> 00:58:49.555
but she never ever
put it down, why?


568
00:58:49.555 --> 00:58:53.263
Well, I found it,
in the basement.


569
00:58:55.721 --> 00:58:58.513
I had it in my hands.

570
00:58:58.513 --> 00:59:00.596
I can show you.

571
00:59:00.596 --> 00:59:03.055
If I find it, then
will you believe me?


572
00:59:14.471 --> 00:59:15.680
Ahh!

573
00:59:19.555 --> 00:59:23.263
I can't see.

574
00:59:23.263 --> 00:59:25.346
She's been here
the whole time.


575
00:59:25.346 --> 00:59:26.721
You did this.

576
00:59:26.721 --> 00:59:29.513
How could I be so stupid?

577
00:59:29.513 --> 00:59:31.346
I didn't touch her!
It was Gail!


578
00:59:31.346 --> 00:59:34.721
Get back. Get away from us.

579
00:59:34.721 --> 00:59:38.513
Get away! Get in there!

580
00:59:38.513 --> 00:59:40.430
Don't make me,
it's too dark.


581
00:59:40.430 --> 00:59:42.346
You are the danger here.

582
00:59:42.346 --> 00:59:44.138
Get in!
No!


583
00:59:44.138 --> 00:59:45.846
Get in!

584
01:00:39.638 --> 01:00:41.638
Leave me alone!

585
01:00:41.638 --> 01:00:43.305
Leave us alone!

586
01:01:30.555 --> 01:01:32.638
What?

587
01:01:37.471 --> 01:01:39.055
What's happening?

588
01:02:12.221 --> 01:02:13.638
Valerie,
move away from her.


589
01:02:13.638 --> 01:02:16.138
What's happening?
Who is it? Is it her?


590
01:02:16.138 --> 01:02:19.471
Comfort...
I tried to tell you.


591
01:02:19.471 --> 01:02:22.471
This is a hospital.

592
01:02:22.471 --> 01:02:25.721
Vulnerable patients,
remember that.


593
01:02:33.596 --> 01:02:36.888
But you didn't listen.

594
01:02:36.888 --> 01:02:38.305
I'm listening now.

595
01:02:46.346 --> 01:02:48.721
Ahh!

596
01:02:57.555 --> 01:02:59.846
Gail?

597
01:02:59.846 --> 01:03:01.721
I didn't do
anything to you, did I?


598
01:03:01.721 --> 01:03:03.138
Gail?

599
01:03:03.138 --> 01:03:04.430
But I should
have told someone.


600
01:03:04.430 --> 01:03:07.513
I know I should have
told someone...


601
01:03:27.555 --> 01:03:29.805
Gail, if that's you,
please...


602
01:03:29.805 --> 01:03:31.555
Please forgive me.

603
01:03:31.555 --> 01:03:33.513
I didn't do anything,
did I?


604
01:03:33.513 --> 01:03:34.680
It was him.

605
01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:36.888
I'm gonna tell everyone
what he did.


606
01:03:36.888 --> 01:03:40.180
I'm gonna tell everyone, Gail!
Don't hurt me!


607
01:03:40.180 --> 01:03:45.513
It's okay,
we can climb down.


608
01:03:45.513 --> 01:03:46.930
I'll look after you,
okay?


609
01:03:46.930 --> 01:03:49.180
I'll--I'll get you
to the other hospital.


610
01:03:49.180 --> 01:03:50.513
Saba.

611
01:04:21.555 --> 01:04:22.805
Val?

612
01:04:39.221 --> 01:04:44.763
Shh.

613
01:05:35.138 --> 01:05:38.138
You have to go.

614
01:05:38.138 --> 01:05:40.555
I don't want
to hurt you.


615
01:05:42.388 --> 01:05:45.555
You're good.

616
01:05:45.555 --> 01:05:48.638
I'm not good.

617
01:05:48.638 --> 01:05:51.013
Deep down.

618
01:05:51.013 --> 01:05:57.096
She can see it.
That's why she's using me.


619
01:05:57.096 --> 01:06:02.888
And if I come back...

620
01:06:02.888 --> 01:06:05.971
do what
you have to.


621
01:07:27.513 --> 01:07:31.096
Angels sent by God to guide me.

622
01:07:31.096 --> 01:07:35.138
Angels sent by God to guide me.

623
01:07:35.138 --> 01:07:38.971
Angels sent by God to guide me.

624
01:07:38.971 --> 01:07:43.638
Angels sent by God to guide me.

625
01:07:56.388 --> 01:08:00.846
Angels sent
by God to guide me...


626
01:08:59.221 --> 01:09:02.055
Saba.

627
01:09:26.513 --> 01:09:29.305
What have you done?

628
01:09:41.388 --> 01:09:43.471
Stop!!

629
01:10:00.388 --> 01:10:03.055
To guide and protect me.

630
01:10:03.055 --> 01:10:05.138
On the paths of life direct me.

631
01:10:05.138 --> 01:10:09.055
It's my body.
You can't use me now.


632
01:10:19.971 --> 01:10:23.596
Oh.

633
01:10:27.430 --> 01:10:31.013
Listen.

634
01:10:32.596 --> 01:10:34.388
Stay quiet,
she'll see me.


635
01:10:34.388 --> 01:10:36.638
Shh...
No.


636
01:10:36.638 --> 01:10:38.638
See what you've done.
Go back and shut your mouth.


637
01:10:38.638 --> 01:10:42.305
Stay quiet.
You're a monster!


638
01:10:50.555 --> 01:10:51.805
Ahh!

639
01:10:51.805 --> 01:10:55.138
Shh.

640
01:11:14.888 --> 01:11:16.930
Jesus, what the hell happened?

641
01:11:44.138 --> 01:11:48.305
Shh.

642
01:11:51.096 --> 01:11:52.930
Good morning, good morning.

643
01:11:52.930 --> 01:11:55.680
East London World Radio,
DJ Mike,


644
01:11:55.680 --> 01:11:58.513
here to soothe your cares away.

645
01:12:19.721 --> 01:12:22.096
Quiet now.
Try not to speak.


646
01:12:25.096 --> 01:12:27.180
You're lucky
to be alive,


647
01:12:27.180 --> 01:12:28.805
but you might wish
you weren't.


648
01:12:33.055 --> 01:12:34.346
She's in here.

649
01:12:34.346 --> 01:12:38.346
My, God, what a mess.

650
01:13:23.888 --> 01:13:25.846
She wouldn't leave me
alone till I brought her,


651
01:13:25.846 --> 01:13:27.680
but I'm not sure
we're allowed in recovery.


652
01:13:27.680 --> 01:13:29.138
Did she hurt you?

653
01:13:29.138 --> 01:13:31.471
Where did you go?

654
01:13:31.471 --> 01:13:32.930
Can you ask her?

655
01:13:43.180 --> 01:13:46.221
She says, "Gail didn't
want to hurt me.


656
01:13:46.221 --> 01:13:49.055
She hid me
till morning."


657
01:13:49.055 --> 01:13:51.055
She hid you?

658
01:13:52.680 --> 01:13:54.846
"She's the same
as you and me."


659
01:14:08.471 --> 01:14:10.471
What --
what did she say?


660
01:14:10.471 --> 01:14:13.096
She said, "Goodbye,
nice to meet you."


661
01:14:13.096 --> 01:14:15.596
Well, no, she didn't.
What was it?


662
01:14:15.596 --> 01:14:17.596
None of it was true,
and I'm new here.


663
01:14:17.596 --> 01:14:18.971
I don't want
trouble, okay?


664
01:14:18.971 --> 01:14:20.221
Where are you
taking her?


665
01:14:20.221 --> 01:14:22.221
Care home, I think.
Best place.


666
01:14:22.221 --> 01:14:24.138
Oh, Saba.

667
01:14:24.138 --> 01:14:26.388
Are you safe now?

668
01:16:06.638 --> 01:16:09.180
Gail?

669
01:16:16.180 --> 01:16:20.055
Two staff members died here
last night, Valerie.


670
01:16:20.055 --> 01:16:21.721
What do you know
about that?


671
01:16:21.721 --> 01:16:24.055
I want to speak to
the police.


672
01:16:24.055 --> 01:16:26.513
We agreed this may be
more my department.


673
01:16:26.513 --> 01:16:28.596
I run
the psychiatric wing.


674
01:16:28.596 --> 01:16:30.305
What happened
last night?


675
01:16:30.305 --> 01:16:32.888
In your mind.

676
01:16:32.888 --> 01:16:36.388
A patient here was
raped and killed.


677
01:16:36.388 --> 01:16:38.180
What do you know
about that?


678
01:16:38.180 --> 01:16:42.096
This is the "ghost"
that you told Comfort about.


679
01:16:42.096 --> 01:16:45.305
Why would this
entity hurt them?


680
01:16:45.305 --> 01:16:47.680
I think Barbara
knew about it.


681
01:16:50.221 --> 01:16:52.096
Maybe Neville did it.

682
01:16:52.096 --> 01:16:56.555
And why did it choose you
to work through?


683
01:16:56.555 --> 01:16:58.846
Are you special
in some way?


684
01:16:58.846 --> 01:17:05.971
Not at all special.
Like her.


685
01:17:05.971 --> 01:17:09.471
But maybe she saw
something I couldn't.


686
01:17:09.471 --> 01:17:11.971
The thing is, Valerie,
you've made things up before,


687
01:17:11.971 --> 01:17:13.805
haven't you?

688
01:17:13.805 --> 01:17:17.180
The rather sordid accusation
against your headmaster,


689
01:17:17.180 --> 01:17:21.430
which you withdrew
and admitted was a lie.


690
01:17:21.430 --> 01:17:23.388
Do you still feel
a need for attention?


691
01:17:26.055 --> 01:17:27.513
Well, I've heard enough.

692
01:17:27.513 --> 01:17:29.263
Well,
what about Gail?


693
01:17:29.263 --> 01:17:31.888
Can you check the basement?
I think he burned the body.


694
01:17:31.888 --> 01:17:34.263
We're never had a patient
here called Gail.


695
01:17:37.888 --> 01:17:39.430
Stop!

696
01:17:43.013 --> 01:17:44.513
I didn't make it up.

697
01:17:48.930 --> 01:17:51.971
The police and the nuns
forced me to say I lied.


698
01:17:57.596 --> 01:17:59.680
And every time
I'm in the dark...


699
01:18:02.721 --> 01:18:04.346
I know it was real.

700
01:18:06.971 --> 01:18:12.388
And Gail is real, and what
happened here is real.


701
01:18:23.805 --> 01:18:27.221
I'll come visit you, Val.
If they let me.


702
01:18:27.221 --> 01:18:30.138
Just...

703
01:18:30.138 --> 01:18:33.013
Check Saba gets away
from here safely.


704
01:18:33.013 --> 01:18:37.096
I will. I'm taking her
to the home myself.


705
01:20:09.846 --> 01:20:12.055
Doctor!

706
01:20:14.138 --> 01:20:16.013
Valerie, you shouldn't
be out of bed.


707
01:20:23.013 --> 01:20:25.888
I want you
to stay here.


708
01:20:25.888 --> 01:20:27.555
Excuse me,
would you mind


709
01:20:27.555 --> 01:20:29.930
just making sure
she doesn't go anywhere?


710
01:20:29.930 --> 01:20:32.555
Thank you.

711
01:20:32.555 --> 01:20:35.096
Come on.
Let's get you back.


712
01:20:45.055 --> 01:20:46.763
Isn't it the basement
you go to?


713
01:20:50.638 --> 01:20:52.221
Very well, then.

714
01:20:55.680 --> 01:20:57.721
Uh, no you don't.
Do as you're told.


715
01:21:19.055 --> 01:21:21.096
Good morning, East London
Royal Infirmary.


716
01:21:21.096 --> 01:21:22.971
Can I help you?

717
01:21:39.263 --> 01:21:40.596
Did Neville
give you those?


718
01:21:40.596 --> 01:21:42.846
He'd do anything
for a nod for a doctor.


719
01:22:11.930 --> 01:22:14.346
Take off your robe.

720
01:22:14.346 --> 01:22:16.763
You had me pinned
from the start, didn't you?


721
01:22:18.888 --> 01:22:21.680
Little nobody who
wouldn't complain.


722
01:22:21.680 --> 01:22:23.888
We're not
here to talk.


723
01:22:23.888 --> 01:22:27.055
Are you
listening to me?


724
01:22:27.055 --> 01:22:31.138
I don't have to
listen to you.


725
01:22:31.138 --> 01:22:33.388
I have
the power here.


726
01:22:33.388 --> 01:22:37.096
Gail was a child.

727
01:22:37.096 --> 01:22:38.596
Where's the power
in that?


728
01:22:42.596 --> 01:22:45.013
Shut up.

729
01:22:45.013 --> 01:22:46.430
You're a coward.

730
01:22:46.430 --> 01:22:48.055
You will shut up
and be quiet.


731
01:22:48.055 --> 01:22:50.596
I will not.
Shut. Up.


732
01:22:50.596 --> 01:22:52.263
No!
Shut up!


733
01:22:52.263 --> 01:22:54.971
And do as I say!
No!


734
01:23:07.471 --> 01:23:11.263
You can't have Saba.

735
01:23:11.263 --> 01:23:13.888
I won't let it
happen again.


736
01:23:15.638 --> 01:23:19.596
Gail.
Come back now.


737
01:23:24.055 --> 01:23:29.846
Oh dear, Valerie.

738
01:23:29.846 --> 01:23:31.638
Looks like ghosts
don't exist.


739
01:23:36.180 --> 01:23:41.263
Just us.

740
01:23:49.138 --> 01:23:50.930
Valerie.

741
01:23:54.680 --> 01:23:59.805
Oh, you girls,
you all sing.


742
01:23:59.805 --> 01:24:01.555
Want the attention.

743
01:24:06.221 --> 01:24:07.680
Hmm.

744
01:24:07.680 --> 01:24:13.180
You want to pull yourself
up out of the depth.


745
01:24:15.471 --> 01:24:21.013
But you can't take.

746
01:24:21.013 --> 01:24:23.013
We are giving.

747
01:24:42.680 --> 01:24:47.346
You have to understand
the system.


748
01:24:47.346 --> 01:24:49.638
You have to
understand...


749
01:24:55.555 --> 01:24:58.638
Ahh!

750
01:25:11.138 --> 01:25:13.846
Val?

751
01:25:21.096 --> 01:25:26.263
Val?

752
01:25:26.263 --> 01:25:28.513
Gail, please.

753
01:25:28.513 --> 01:25:30.930
Please.

754
01:25:30.930 --> 01:25:32.388
Together.

755
01:25:32.388 --> 01:25:35.721
I told you to stay.

756
01:25:42.221 --> 01:25:44.346
All this running away.

757
01:25:44.346 --> 01:25:47.805
No one is going to
look for you now.


758
01:26:12.346 --> 01:26:17.638
You will listen to us.

759
01:26:50.471 --> 01:26:53.013
Yes?

760
01:26:53.013 --> 01:26:55.555
It's coming.

761
01:26:55.555 --> 01:26:57.721
There's someone
coming.


762
01:26:57.721 --> 01:26:59.180
Who is it?

763
01:26:59.180 --> 01:27:01.096
We blame you.

764
01:27:01.096 --> 01:27:04.013
For letting
this place be rotten.


765
01:27:15.055 --> 01:27:17.388
There's another way.

766
01:27:23.721 --> 01:27:26.971
She doesn't want
to be laid to rest.


767
01:27:26.971 --> 01:27:30.180
So think of us
when it's dark.
