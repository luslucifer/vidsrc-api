00:00:24.564 --> 00:00:27.150
<i>Most people
feel comfortable flying.</i>


2
00:00:28.985 --> 00:00:31.279
<i>I would say the majority of people
have gotten accustomed</i>


3
00:00:31.362 --> 00:00:33.198
<i>to how safe the system is.</i>

4
00:00:35.825 --> 00:00:36.825
<i>Every day,</i>

5
00:00:37.577 --> 00:00:39.454
<i>tens of thousands of flights,</i>

6
00:00:40.038 --> 00:00:41.289
<i>all over the world.</i>

7
00:00:48.046 --> 00:00:50.882
<i>There's an old saying in aviation,</i>

8
00:00:51.633 --> 00:00:54.344
<i>"If it ain't Boeing, 
I ain't going."</i>

9
00:00:55.929 --> 00:00:58.681
<i>Boeing has had such a storied history</i>

10
00:00:58.765 --> 00:01:03.436
<i>and such an incredible stature
in the industry.</i>


11
00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:07.398
<i>At any given moment,</i>

12
00:01:07.482 --> 00:01:11.236
<i>roughly 10,000 Boeing aircraft
are in service</i>


13
00:01:11.319 --> 00:01:13.738
<i>in more than 150 countries.</i>

14
00:01:28.378 --> 00:01:30.213
<i>I've reported on aviation</i>

15
00:01:30.296 --> 00:01:33.424
<i>for more than 20 years
at</i>The Wall Street Journal.


16
00:01:33.925 --> 00:01:37.220
Hello there. It's, uh, Andy Pasztor
from <i>The Wall Street Journal.</i>


17
00:01:37.804 --> 00:01:39.722
I know that you've
been asked not to talk,

18
00:01:39.806 --> 00:01:41.808
but I'm hoping
that you can take a few minutes


19
00:01:41.891 --> 00:01:44.310
just to answer some questions.

20
00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.731
<i>By the beginning of 2018,</i>

21
00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:53.069
<i>we'd come through the safest period
for commercial aviation</i>


22
00:01:53.153 --> 00:01:54.988
<i>in the history of aviation.</i>

23
00:01:57.532 --> 00:02:00.577
<i>There actually hadn't been
a big passenger jet crash</i>


24
00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.787
<i>anywhere in the world the previous year.</i>

25
00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.714
<i>Boeing has had so much success</i>

26
00:02:13.298 --> 00:02:18.219
<i>producing incredibly safe,
reliable aircraft</i>


27
00:02:18.303 --> 00:02:21.931
<i>that pilots and passengers
admire and love to fly on.</i>


28
00:02:23.683 --> 00:02:25.810
<i>They had the public's trust.</i>

29
00:02:29.856 --> 00:02:33.359
<i>And then two planes
dropped out of the sky.</i>


30
00:02:57.091 --> 00:03:00.929
I don't remember the time.
I would say quite early in the morning.


31
00:03:03.598 --> 00:03:05.058
It was dark, I remember.

32
00:03:08.144 --> 00:03:10.313
My husband
prepared his flight bag,


33
00:03:10.813 --> 00:03:11.898
checked his schedule,

34
00:03:11.981 --> 00:03:14.609
checked out with his colleague
that he's flying with.


35
00:03:15.944 --> 00:03:19.447
We had a meal
and had a chat for 20, 30 minutes.


36
00:03:21.032 --> 00:03:23.576
That was the normal routine
before he left for his flight.


37
00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:28.748
After he left, 
I went back to sleep,

38
00:03:29.457 --> 00:03:32.669
and after a few hours,
I was expecting a call from him.


39
00:03:33.461 --> 00:03:35.463
You know, just normal working day.

40
00:03:42.136 --> 00:03:46.057
<i>Lion Inter 610

41
00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.893
Lion Inter 610
cleared for takeoff, 2-5 left.


42
00:03:55.441 --> 00:03:57.235
- <i>V1.</i>

49
00:04:31.311 --> 00:04:34.456
- <i>Lion Inter 610?
-</i>We have a flight control problem.


50
00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.025
<i>Terrain. Terrain.
Pull up. Pull up.</i>


51
00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:40.611
<i>Terrain. Terrain.</i>

52
00:04:40.695 --> 00:04:41.946
Fly up! Fly up!

53
00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.458
I got a call
from one of his colleagues,


54
00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:56.210
"We are not able to find his aircraft."

55
00:04:56.878 --> 00:05:00.298
I'm like, "Don't worry."
Because I knew... I... I knew my husband.


56
00:05:00.381 --> 00:05:01.507
I knew how he flew.

57
00:05:02.925 --> 00:05:04.427
I was just expecting a call from him.

58
00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:07.972
You know, "I've reached."
That was the norm that we used to follow.


59
00:05:08.056 --> 00:05:11.642
So I was expecting that call
from him instead of anyone else.


60
00:05:13.686 --> 00:05:16.939
And after that,
it's just been... Everyone knows.


61
00:05:20.777 --> 00:05:24.113
<i>Lion Air Flight 610
went missing from radar</i>


62
00:05:24.197 --> 00:05:27.283
<i>just a few minutes
after taking off from Jakarta.</i>


63
00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:33.164
A brand-new Boeing 737
with 189 people onboard


64
00:05:33.247 --> 00:05:35.083
crashing moments after takeoff...

65
00:05:49.806 --> 00:05:52.159
You mentioned
this was a... a Boeing aircraft.


66
00:05:52.183 --> 00:05:54.852
What more do we know
about the plane, Benjamin?


67
00:05:54.936 --> 00:05:57.397
Yeah, a Boeing, as you said,
uh, almost brand-new.


68
00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.482
They had taken delivery of it
back in August.


69
00:05:59.565 --> 00:06:03.111
It was a 737 Max.
That's the updated version of the 737.


70
00:06:03.194 --> 00:06:04.904
They haven't been out that long.

71
00:06:12.161 --> 00:06:13.496
That morning,

72
00:06:13.579 --> 00:06:16.416
our families were trying
to find out information.


73
00:06:16.916 --> 00:06:19.544
Trying to understand what was going on.

74
00:06:24.799 --> 00:06:29.095
Very soon, everyone there
became aware of what had happened.


75
00:06:30.471 --> 00:06:32.849
And that nobody was coming back.

76
00:06:40.565 --> 00:06:43.734
What I was going through,
it was just pain.


77
00:06:44.902 --> 00:06:46.571
I don't remember a thing.

78
00:06:47.488 --> 00:06:50.575
Just except the pain,
there was nothing, purely pain.


79
00:06:56.581 --> 00:06:57.581
To my husband,

80
00:06:57.957 --> 00:06:58.958
all that mattered

81
00:06:59.542 --> 00:07:02.170
was the safety
and security of his passengers.


82
00:07:06.048 --> 00:07:09.510
He's flying with 188 people
along with him.


83
00:07:11.554 --> 00:07:14.265
And the grief
that I felt for those families,


84
00:07:15.141 --> 00:07:16.184
unbelievable.

85
00:07:18.352 --> 00:07:19.352
Unbelievable.

86
00:07:28.988 --> 00:07:32.700
In the first day
or two days after a crash,


87
00:07:32.783 --> 00:07:35.578
there's really very little information
about the cause.


88
00:07:37.497 --> 00:07:39.832
In this case,
the weather appeared to be good.


89
00:07:39.916 --> 00:07:41.584
It was very close to the airport.

90
00:07:42.251 --> 00:07:44.295
And this is a brand-new plane

91
00:07:44.378 --> 00:07:47.965
built by America's
premier aircraft manufacturer.


92
00:07:48.883 --> 00:07:51.677
And unless the black boxes
are found quickly,


93
00:07:51.761 --> 00:07:53.262
it's all speculation.

94
00:07:55.264 --> 00:07:57.934
Lion Air
has a spotty safety record.


95
00:07:58.017 --> 00:08:02.355
Along with several Indonesian carriers,
the low-cost airline was banned


96
00:08:02.438 --> 00:08:05.107
from flying into the United States
and Europe


97
00:08:05.191 --> 00:08:06.901
but improved in recent years.

98
00:08:08.027 --> 00:08:09.946
I was following the news,

99
00:08:10.029 --> 00:08:12.073
reading each and every article,

100
00:08:12.156 --> 00:08:13.658
anything that was online.

101
00:08:14.283 --> 00:08:16.244
They all said the same thing.

102
00:08:17.537 --> 00:08:18.788
They started blaming.

103
00:08:18.871 --> 00:08:20.498
There was a blame game going on.

104
00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:22.542
Blaming the country,

105
00:08:23.376 --> 00:08:24.627
blaming the airline,

106
00:08:25.962 --> 00:08:27.213
blaming the pilots,

107
00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:31.342
saying that it was their incompetence.

108
00:08:32.134 --> 00:08:36.055
The airline probably needed to do
a better job of making sure its pilots


109
00:08:36.138 --> 00:08:41.269
understood exactly what to do
in case the aircraft was performing


110
00:08:41.352 --> 00:08:45.523
in a unique, unusual way
and how to get out of the problem.


111
00:08:46.023 --> 00:08:49.235
Should passengers getting
on a 737 Max be concerned?


112
00:08:49.986 --> 00:08:52.863
I don't think so.
Certainly, in the United States,


113
00:08:52.947 --> 00:08:55.491
they understand
how to operate this aircraft.


114
00:08:57.368 --> 00:08:59.787
No one thought it was the airplane.

115
00:09:00.705 --> 00:09:04.959
I am in... in print being asked
what this could possibly be and I said,


116
00:09:05.042 --> 00:09:06.836
I would be phenomenally surprised

117
00:09:06.919 --> 00:09:11.090
if it was related to any...
any part of the airplane's design.


118
00:09:11.799 --> 00:09:13.509
I mean, it was a Boeing.

119
00:09:14.885 --> 00:09:19.015
Everyone in the world
knew what Boeing stood for.


120
00:09:19.765 --> 00:09:23.269
Their reputation for safety
was tremendous.


121
00:09:24.562 --> 00:09:26.022
And at that point,

122
00:09:26.105 --> 00:09:29.984
there really wasn't enough information
to draw any conclusions.


123
00:09:31.152 --> 00:09:35.656
But then, the Indonesian investigators
found the black boxes.


124
00:09:36.949 --> 00:09:40.786
There are two black boxes,
both of which are orange, by the way.


125
00:09:41.495 --> 00:09:43.831
One is called a cockpit voice recorder,

126
00:09:44.332 --> 00:09:46.834
and the other one
is called a flight data recorder.


127
00:09:47.668 --> 00:09:50.421
It records the altitude
and the airspeed and the direction


128
00:09:50.504 --> 00:09:52.256
and what the throttles are doing.

129
00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:54.140
Thousands of parameters,
eight times a second,


130
00:09:54.175 --> 00:09:57.553
so it's a very comprehensive tally
of what happened on the airplane.


131
00:10:00.014 --> 00:10:03.351
The flight data recorder
showed that right after takeoff,


132
00:10:03.434 --> 00:10:06.771
there was a failure of
the left-hand angle-of-attack indicator.


133
00:10:07.813 --> 00:10:11.359
That's a sensor that's located
on either side of the airplane


134
00:10:11.442 --> 00:10:15.071
that measures the angle
of the nose during flight.


135
00:10:17.948 --> 00:10:20.951
As soon as
the faulty angle-of-attack sensors sent


136
00:10:21.035 --> 00:10:23.412
bad data to the aircraft systems,

137
00:10:23.996 --> 00:10:28.751
the stick shaker on the captain's side
would have been loudly vibrating


138
00:10:28.834 --> 00:10:31.712
his control column
to warn of an impending stall.


139
00:10:32.546 --> 00:10:33.923
But that was a false warning.

140
00:10:34.006 --> 00:10:35.966
The airplane wasn't stalling.
It was flying.


141
00:10:38.094 --> 00:10:40.888
Right away,
not only did the stick shaker go off,


142
00:10:41.806 --> 00:10:44.016
but there was a master caution light,

143
00:10:44.725 --> 00:10:48.896
airspeed disagree alerts,
and the altitude's not reading right.


144
00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:53.776
You have this tidal wave of distraction.

145
00:10:55.236 --> 00:10:57.655
And on top of all that,
something was putting


146
00:10:57.738 --> 00:11:01.075
repeated nose-down pressure
on the airplane.


147
00:11:02.368 --> 00:11:05.705
These pilots are fighting
and are pulling back up on the airplane


148
00:11:05.788 --> 00:11:07.790
and trying to get
it to come back up.

149
00:11:09.208 --> 00:11:12.211
But it happens again
and drives the nose back down.


150
00:11:13.254 --> 00:11:15.756
So they're having this oscillating battle.

151
00:11:16.966 --> 00:11:19.802
I remember thinking,
"What's making that happen?"


152
00:11:24.223 --> 00:11:26.892
The official response
from Boeing was,


153
00:11:26.976 --> 00:11:30.813
we're looking at it, we're cooperating,
we don't know quite what happened.


154
00:11:30.896 --> 00:11:34.316
Our sincere apologies to the families.
What you would expect.


155
00:11:35.317 --> 00:11:37.862
Dennis Muilenburg,
who was chairman, simply said,


156
00:11:37.945 --> 00:11:41.365
"Well, you know, we can't really comment
on the investigation."


157
00:11:42.992 --> 00:11:45.786
But we found out that behind the scenes,

158
00:11:46.287 --> 00:11:49.707
Boeing was saying that an American pilot

159
00:11:50.666 --> 00:11:53.377
would never have gotten
into this kind of a situation


160
00:11:54.378 --> 00:11:58.966
and that the Indonesian crew didn't do
everything they were supposed to do.


161
00:12:00.259 --> 00:12:02.136
I wouldn't say it was racist,

162
00:12:02.219 --> 00:12:04.221
but I actually remember a point

163
00:12:04.305 --> 00:12:07.516
where they spoke
about my husband's qualifications.


164
00:12:08.392 --> 00:12:10.712
They wanted to know
where he completed his flight training.


165
00:12:11.687 --> 00:12:14.315
In fact, he finished
his training in the US.


166
00:12:17.318 --> 00:12:20.654
<i>By this time,
the second week of November...</i>


167
00:12:20.738 --> 00:12:23.199
It's Andy Pasztor
from <i>The Wall Street Journal.</i>


168
00:12:23.282 --> 00:12:27.328
<i>...we began asking questions
about the design of this aircraft,</i>


169
00:12:27.411 --> 00:12:29.914
<i>rather than the operation of the aircraft.</i>

170
00:12:30.456 --> 00:12:36.212
I'm hoping to talk with you
about the 737 investigation.


171
00:12:36.295 --> 00:12:38.464
<i>We could not understand what was going on.</i>

172
00:12:38.964 --> 00:12:43.552
<i>How could a single damaged sensor
make the plane behave like this?</i>


173
00:12:46.305 --> 00:12:48.974
Finally, Boeing
released a statement,


174
00:12:49.058 --> 00:12:54.104
saying it looks like the Lion Air airplane
had an erroneous MCAS activation.


175
00:12:55.189 --> 00:12:58.818
And all of us went, "What's an MCAS?"

176
00:13:00.694 --> 00:13:02.947
MCAS?
I've never heard of this before.


177
00:13:03.447 --> 00:13:04.447
What is this?

178
00:13:05.241 --> 00:13:09.161
I'm looking through the manual.
It was in the abbreviation section.


179
00:13:10.246 --> 00:13:14.166
How could it be in the abbreviations
but nowhere else? What is this system?


180
00:13:16.544 --> 00:13:17.544
The MCAS,

181
00:13:18.003 --> 00:13:21.298
or the Maneuvering Characteristics
Augmentation System,


182
00:13:21.799 --> 00:13:26.762
really is just some software
connected to the angle-of-attack sensors.


183
00:13:27.763 --> 00:13:30.641
Because of the flight characteristics
of the new Max,


184
00:13:30.724 --> 00:13:34.562
when certain angle-of-attacks
were reached, at certain speeds,


185
00:13:35.062 --> 00:13:37.064
the airplane tended to stall out.

186
00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:42.528
So the MCAS was designed
to automatically push the nose back down.


187
00:13:43.904 --> 00:13:44.989
Simple concept.

188
00:13:45.656 --> 00:13:49.702
All they had to do was to add
a few lines of code to an existing system.


189
00:13:51.287 --> 00:13:54.331
MCAS was designed
to work in the background,


190
00:13:54.832 --> 00:13:57.001
using the speed trim motor

191
00:13:57.084 --> 00:13:59.086
to swivel the horizontal stabilizer

192
00:13:59.587 --> 00:14:02.548
just a little bit each time it sensed

193
00:14:02.631 --> 00:14:05.593
that the angle-of-attack
was... was too high.


194
00:14:05.676 --> 00:14:07.928
It would smoothly bring the nose down.

195
00:14:09.179 --> 00:14:11.557
But in the case
of the Lion Air crash,

196
00:14:12.057 --> 00:14:14.268
an angle-of-attack sensor was broken,

197
00:14:14.768 --> 00:14:16.937
which erroneously activated MCAS,

198
00:14:17.813 --> 00:14:19.690
and it activated repeatedly.

199
00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:28.616
Boeing said that the crew did not respond
in a way that they expected them to.


200
00:14:29.116 --> 00:14:30.993
They didn't switch the system off.

201
00:14:34.955 --> 00:14:36.749
The only problem was,

202
00:14:36.832 --> 00:14:40.753
and everybody was
completely flummoxed and surprised


203
00:14:40.836 --> 00:14:41.879
when they found out,

204
00:14:42.463 --> 00:14:47.760
Boeing had never told pilots
that the MCAS system was on the aircraft.


205
00:14:50.304 --> 00:14:52.056
Say what?

206
00:14:52.556 --> 00:14:54.600
Uh, huh. Uh...

207
00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:58.354
Yeah, I mean, that was
my response, like, "What?"


208
00:14:58.854 --> 00:15:01.357
Um, yeah, uh...

209
00:15:03.359 --> 00:15:06.236
How... how the heck
could this happen?


210
00:15:07.821 --> 00:15:11.325
Hello there. It's Andy Pasztor
from <i>The Wall Street Journal.</i>


211
00:15:11.408 --> 00:15:13.077
Is this a good time to talk?

212
00:15:13.661 --> 00:15:17.247
Good. I just wanted
to follow up on our last discussion.


213
00:15:17.331 --> 00:15:20.501
You were nice enough
to give me some time, and, uh...


214
00:15:20.584 --> 00:15:22.920
After a lot of knocking on doors,

215
00:15:23.003 --> 00:15:26.757
a very senior Boeing executive

216
00:15:27.341 --> 00:15:31.720
told me, "We never informed
the pilots about MCAS."


217
00:15:32.221 --> 00:15:34.139
"We never explained it to them."

218
00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:36.558
"We never trained them on it,

219
00:15:37.059 --> 00:15:40.396
because we didn't want
to overwhelm them with information."


220
00:15:41.355 --> 00:15:45.442
That took my colleagues
and myself quite aback.


221
00:15:45.526 --> 00:15:48.529
We'd never heard a senior Boeing official

222
00:15:48.612 --> 00:15:51.115
talking along those lines.

223
00:15:51.198 --> 00:15:56.370
Boeing had always prided itself
for being the pilot's advocate.


224
00:15:58.330 --> 00:15:59.957
So we wrote a story

225
00:16:00.666 --> 00:16:05.754
saying that Boeing
had proactively decided not to tell pilots


226
00:16:05.838 --> 00:16:07.506
about the MCAS system.

227
00:16:08.549 --> 00:16:10.467
New questions this morning for Boeing.

228
00:16:10.551 --> 00:16:13.721
<i>The Wall Street Journal</i> is reporting
that Boeing withheld information


229
00:16:13.804 --> 00:16:17.599
on its 737 model,
according to safety experts and others...


230
00:16:17.683 --> 00:16:21.395
As soon as it became clear
that this wasn't an oversight,


231
00:16:21.478 --> 00:16:24.273
this wasn't just left out by accident,

232
00:16:24.356 --> 00:16:25.899
pilots went berserk.

233
00:16:27.192 --> 00:16:28.819
We couldn't believe it.

234
00:16:28.902 --> 00:16:33.782
And once we started learning more
about this MCAS system,


235
00:16:33.866 --> 00:16:36.493
it became our number one priority.

236
00:16:39.872 --> 00:16:42.332
I found it disrespectful. Um,

237
00:16:42.416 --> 00:16:44.293
every pilot I ever taught,

238
00:16:44.376 --> 00:16:47.463
I said you want to know
as much about your airplane as possible.


239
00:16:48.255 --> 00:16:50.015
<i>In this series
of modules,</i>


240
00:16:50.049 --> 00:16:51.633
<i>we will discuss the differences</i>

241
00:16:51.717 --> 00:16:56.138
<i>between the Boeing 737 NG
and 737 Max aircraft.</i>


242
00:16:56.221 --> 00:17:01.060
<i>The 737 Max is the successor
to the 737 Next Generation...</i>


243
00:17:01.143 --> 00:17:03.687
Facts should not be hidden
from the pilots.


244
00:17:04.772 --> 00:17:07.066
The only training my husband was given

245
00:17:07.149 --> 00:17:10.402
was an iPad training,
and it never mentioned MCAS.


246
00:17:10.486 --> 00:17:12.922
<i>...improvements
similar to existing aircraft...</i>


247
00:17:12.946 --> 00:17:17.701
I kept on insisting with the investigators
that this aircraft should be grounded.


248
00:17:18.494 --> 00:17:21.497
But Boeing has
a big reputation around the world.


249
00:17:23.624 --> 00:17:25.709
Here's what Boeing did.

250
00:17:25.793 --> 00:17:28.712
They started contacting pilots' unions.

251
00:17:29.463 --> 00:17:32.174
So I got a call saying
that Boeing's gonna come down


252
00:17:32.257 --> 00:17:35.260
and brief us on this MCAS system.

253
00:17:36.011 --> 00:17:39.181
This was monumental. It's the first time
high-level Boeing executives


254
00:17:39.264 --> 00:17:42.434
have ever come to visit
the Allied Pilots Association.


255
00:17:43.102 --> 00:17:47.523
So, on November 27th,
I met them at the door.


256
00:17:49.108 --> 00:17:51.401
First of all,
they brought their lobbyists.


257
00:17:51.902 --> 00:17:54.488
Who brings a lobbyist to a safety meeting?

258
00:17:57.241 --> 00:18:01.453
I could see that they weren't interested
in, uh... in exchanging pleasantries,


259
00:18:02.496 --> 00:18:04.706
so, we went into our conference room.

260
00:18:07.209 --> 00:18:08.293
We all sat down.

261
00:18:09.253 --> 00:18:12.714
I just assumed they were gonna bring
PowerPoint presentations,


262
00:18:12.798 --> 00:18:14.633
graphs, charts, data.

263
00:18:15.676 --> 00:18:17.594
And they don't have anything.

264
00:18:19.221 --> 00:18:20.722
It's just them.

265
00:18:22.224 --> 00:18:24.309
I could see that they were worried.

266
00:18:25.185 --> 00:18:26.603
So I taped the meeting.

267
00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:30.858
<i>These guys didn't even know
the damn system was on here.</i>


268
00:18:30.941 --> 00:18:32.109
<i>Nor did anybody else.</i>

269
00:18:32.609 --> 00:18:35.004
<i>We try not to overload
the crews with information</i>


270
00:18:35.028 --> 00:18:36.029
<i>that's unnecessary.</i>

271
00:18:37.156 --> 00:18:39.076
<i>I would think
there would be a priority</i>


272
00:18:39.116 --> 00:18:42.035
<i>on explanations of things
that could kill you.</i>


273
00:18:42.536 --> 00:18:44.788
<i>We take your point.
We really do.</i>


274
00:18:45.539 --> 00:18:49.168
<i>Is there something being done
where Boeing might address</i>


275
00:18:49.251 --> 00:18:50.931
<i>ways to make sure it doesn't happen again?</i>

276
00:18:51.753 --> 00:18:54.756
<i>We're looking at relatively
straightforward software changes</i>


277
00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:58.010
<i>that we expect we can get out
in a fairly short period of time.</i>


278
00:18:58.093 --> 00:18:59.219
<i>Maybe six weeks.</i>

279
00:19:00.679 --> 00:19:02.222
They've told us at that meeting,

280
00:19:02.306 --> 00:19:04.808
they're gonna have
a software fix in six weeks.


281
00:19:05.309 --> 00:19:07.978
Nothing gets done in six weeks.

282
00:19:09.646 --> 00:19:13.734
So we asked, "Why don't you just ground
the airplane till you have this fix?"


283
00:19:14.985 --> 00:19:17.946
<i>'Cause no one
has yet concluded</i>


284
00:19:18.447 --> 00:19:21.575
<i>that the sole cause of this
was dysfunction of the airplane.</i>


285
00:19:22.576 --> 00:19:24.745
They could have grounded
the plane,


286
00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:31.210
but Boeing had the stature to say,
"This is a terrible thing that happened."


287
00:19:31.293 --> 00:19:33.337
"We're working on it. Trust us."

288
00:19:33.837 --> 00:19:35.839
Joining me
right now is the chairman,


289
00:19:35.923 --> 00:19:38.717
president, and CEO of Boeing,
Dennis Muilenburg.


290
00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:40.695
- Dennis, it's good to see you.
- Good to see you.


291
00:19:40.719 --> 00:19:43.513
Thank you so much for joining us.
What can you tell us in terms of


292
00:19:43.597 --> 00:19:46.558
what was told
to the pilots and the airlines


293
00:19:46.642 --> 00:19:50.145
about any new equipment in that 737.

294
00:19:50.229 --> 00:19:53.315
We've already issued additional bulletins
to our operators and pilots


295
00:19:53.398 --> 00:19:56.860
around the world that point them back
to existing flight procedures


296
00:19:56.944 --> 00:19:58.654
to handle that kind of condition.

297
00:19:58.737 --> 00:20:02.199
The bottom line here
is the 737 Max is safe.


298
00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.628
<i>Our breaking news,
an Ethiopian Airlines flight</i>


299
00:20:14.711 --> 00:20:17.756
<i>has crashed shortly after takeoff
from Addis Ababa,</i>


300
00:20:17.839 --> 00:20:21.385
<i>killing all 157 passengers and crew</i>

301
00:20:21.468 --> 00:20:22.803
<i>thought to be on board.</i>

302
00:20:22.886 --> 00:20:23.929
<i>The airline told...</i>

303
00:20:24.012 --> 00:20:29.518
My wife, Nadia, she stayed up,
and at night she would listen to the BBC.


304
00:20:29.601 --> 00:20:32.980
And the BBC said
that there was just a...

305
00:20:34.398 --> 00:20:35.524
a crash

306
00:20:36.566 --> 00:20:40.529
of an airplane
that had just left Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.


307
00:20:41.905 --> 00:20:46.076
Our daughter, Samya,
had texted us earlier that night to say,


308
00:20:46.576 --> 00:20:51.373
"I just landed in Addis.
Just a few more hours and on to Nairobi."


309
00:20:53.667 --> 00:20:56.128
Samya had had a career in public health.

310
00:20:57.087 --> 00:21:00.424
She had been to Africa
a couple times before.


311
00:21:00.507 --> 00:21:02.467
You know, it's just another trip.

312
00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:07.723
And, uh, so Nadia
woke me up and, uh, said,


313
00:21:08.223 --> 00:21:11.184
"I think Samya was
on a plane that just crashed."


314
00:21:13.228 --> 00:21:15.063
And I thought, "That can't be."

315
00:21:16.398 --> 00:21:17.649
"That can't be."

316
00:21:23.196 --> 00:21:25.157
"It can't be her flight."

317
00:21:25.824 --> 00:21:30.912
And then we found out
it was... she was on Flight 302.


318
00:21:30.996 --> 00:21:33.540
That was her plane.

319
00:21:36.543 --> 00:21:41.715
Everybody else's dad, you know,
drinks alcohol, maybe smokes cigarettes.


320
00:21:42.341 --> 00:21:44.426
My dad was addicted to tea.

321
00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:48.013
He would have 20 cups a day.

322
00:21:49.848 --> 00:21:51.558
He was going back to Kenya

323
00:21:52.059 --> 00:21:55.562
because he wanted to better
the community that he grew up in.


324
00:21:56.980 --> 00:22:00.025
He called from the airport,
and he just said, you know,


325
00:22:00.108 --> 00:22:03.612
"Hey, Zippy, I just wanted to let you know
I'm about to board the flight."


326
00:22:03.695 --> 00:22:05.739
It was about 8:00 p.m. at night,

327
00:22:05.822 --> 00:22:08.617
and I remember I sat on my couch
and said, "Okay, Dad."


328
00:22:09.201 --> 00:22:13.121
I just remember he said, "I love you."
And I said, you know, "I love you too."


329
00:22:19.336 --> 00:22:21.922
The next morning, my phone was ringing,

330
00:22:23.006 --> 00:22:24.674
and it's my brother calling.

331
00:22:25.550 --> 00:22:28.762
And he said,
"I need you to brace yourself."


332
00:22:28.845 --> 00:22:32.933
"There's a plane
that has crashed in Ethiopia,


333
00:22:33.016 --> 00:22:35.727
and there's a high chance
that it's the flight that Dad was on."


334
00:22:36.770 --> 00:22:40.107
And I was like,
"Dad never flew on Ethiopian Airlines,


335
00:22:40.774 --> 00:22:45.487
so he definitely wasn't on that plane."
And he was like, "No, this time he did."


336
00:22:49.825 --> 00:22:52.077
Nadia said,
"We... we have to go there."


337
00:22:54.037 --> 00:22:55.997
So, we drove to JFK

338
00:22:56.498 --> 00:22:57.707
and got on a plane.

339
00:23:02.879 --> 00:23:07.384
When we got to Ethiopia, they wouldn't let
people go to the crash site.


340
00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:10.470
So we stayed in Addis Ababa,

341
00:23:11.596 --> 00:23:13.890
as did many other families.

342
00:23:16.226 --> 00:23:20.605
It took us three days
to really verify that there just is no...


343
00:23:22.899 --> 00:23:24.734
bodies to recover.

344
00:23:26.153 --> 00:23:29.322
So finally they took
us to the crash site.

345
00:23:33.577 --> 00:23:35.704
There was
a few plane parts around,


346
00:23:36.663 --> 00:23:39.207
not nearly enough
to make up a whole plane.


347
00:23:41.585 --> 00:23:45.964
There were personal things
strewn all around the crash site.


348
00:23:47.257 --> 00:23:49.801
Some clothes that were fluttering about.

349
00:23:49.885 --> 00:23:51.595
Some papers fluttering about.

350
00:23:55.056 --> 00:23:56.308
And there was a hole.

351
00:23:57.559 --> 00:24:00.812
The plane went 500, 600 miles an hour

352
00:24:00.896 --> 00:24:03.940
straight into the...
straight into the ground.


353
00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:11.031
I saw people gathered
about the crater looking down.


354
00:24:12.991 --> 00:24:14.576
Some brought flowers.

355
00:24:16.328 --> 00:24:21.082
Nadia had brought flowers,
roses for Samya Rose and threw them...


356
00:24:24.544 --> 00:24:25.545
threw them in.

357
00:24:39.684 --> 00:24:43.271
Just the idea that a plane
within five months, the same plane,


358
00:24:43.355 --> 00:24:47.526
a <i>new</i> plane went down
in eerily similar circumstances,


359
00:24:48.026 --> 00:24:52.656
close to the airport,
relatively low altitude, not bad weather.


360
00:24:52.739 --> 00:24:57.327
All the obvious reasons
that planes would... would... would crash.


361
00:24:57.410 --> 00:25:00.372
Boeing faces a lot
of safety questions this morning


362
00:25:00.455 --> 00:25:04.084
because this is the second crash
in just five months involving


363
00:25:04.167 --> 00:25:06.378
their best-selling passenger jet.

364
00:25:06.461 --> 00:25:09.422
Major US carriers use this new aircraft.

365
00:25:09.506 --> 00:25:12.300
Hundreds are in service,
thousands are on order,


366
00:25:12.384 --> 00:25:15.845
and there are calls
this morning to ground all of them.


367
00:25:16.972 --> 00:25:18.890
Two crashes
of brand-new airplanes


368
00:25:18.974 --> 00:25:20.767
within five months of each other.

369
00:25:21.268 --> 00:25:24.354
That doesn't happen in modern aviation.

370
00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:27.691
But Boeing would not publicly consider

371
00:25:27.774 --> 00:25:30.944
that something was... was wrong
with the design of the airplane.


372
00:25:31.027 --> 00:25:33.989
There are a lot of passengers
who are afraid of the Max.


373
00:25:34.072 --> 00:25:36.491
Again, our commitment
to safety is unwavering,


374
00:25:36.575 --> 00:25:39.119
and, uh, we do regret
the impact that this has had...


375
00:25:39.703 --> 00:25:42.872
Safety is at the core
of who we are at Boeing.


376
00:25:43.373 --> 00:25:46.251
And ensuring safe
and reliable travel on our airplanes...


377
00:25:46.334 --> 00:25:50.046
The statement coming from Boeing,
"Safety is Boeing's number one priority."


378
00:25:50.130 --> 00:25:53.091
"We have full confidence
in the safety of the Max."


379
00:25:53.174 --> 00:25:57.012
"It is also important to note
that the Federal Aviation Administration


380
00:25:57.095 --> 00:26:00.765
is not mandating
any further action at this time."


381
00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:03.100
The FAA,

382
00:26:03.518 --> 00:26:05.520
the Federal Aviation Administration,

383
00:26:05.604 --> 00:26:08.732
who's in charge
of aviation safety in the US,


384
00:26:08.815 --> 00:26:11.443
had the power to ground the aircraft.

385
00:26:13.486 --> 00:26:15.780
The FAA said
it was waiting for data,


386
00:26:16.364 --> 00:26:18.450
and until we have that data,

387
00:26:19.034 --> 00:26:21.244
making a decision would be premature.

388
00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:24.914
So they didn't make
a decision one way or the other.


389
00:26:26.583 --> 00:26:31.796
The day after the crash,
the Chinese absolutely floored everyone


390
00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:35.467
when they, on their own,
unilaterally ground this aircraft.


391
00:26:38.511 --> 00:26:42.641
And that started a whole series of moves

392
00:26:42.724 --> 00:26:44.351
by other countries.

393
00:26:44.434 --> 00:26:46.770
Australia,
New Zealand, Malaysia, Singapore,


394
00:26:46.853 --> 00:26:49.939
France, Germany, Italy,
UK, Ireland, Netherlands.


395
00:26:50.023 --> 00:26:51.107
I could go on.

396
00:26:51.608 --> 00:26:54.861
It does seem like
a bit of a rebuke of the FAA.


397
00:26:56.488 --> 00:26:57.614
If an issue

398
00:26:58.490 --> 00:27:02.619
that affects safety is identified,

399
00:27:02.702 --> 00:27:07.165
the department and the FAA
will not hesitate


400
00:27:07.248 --> 00:27:11.002
to take immediate and appropriate action.

401
00:27:11.586 --> 00:27:14.673
To us,
to the families of the victims,


402
00:27:15.256 --> 00:27:18.760
it was astounding
that the plane was still up in the air,


403
00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:22.681
especially after two crashes.

404
00:27:22.764 --> 00:27:26.017
We turn now to new developments
in the deadly Ethiopian Airlines crash.


405
00:27:26.101 --> 00:27:27.602
With a cause still a mystery,

406
00:27:27.686 --> 00:27:30.313
the black boxes
are being analyzed in France,


407
00:27:30.397 --> 00:27:33.650
as new details emerge
about the flight's final moments.


408
00:27:34.234 --> 00:27:37.028
We're getting
more information on the flight path,


409
00:27:37.112 --> 00:27:41.074
and it's looking
very similar to the Lion Air crash.


410
00:27:43.493 --> 00:27:47.038
And then in Ethiopia,
they found the jackscrew.


411
00:27:48.331 --> 00:27:51.918
Jackscrew is this long screw,
about so thick,


412
00:27:52.419 --> 00:27:54.754
that operates the stabilizer trim.

413
00:27:57.966 --> 00:28:02.220
They found the jackscrew
in a full nose-down position.


414
00:28:03.722 --> 00:28:05.390
Hands down, it was the MCAS.

415
00:28:06.641 --> 00:28:08.059
Within 30 minutes,

416
00:28:08.143 --> 00:28:09.894
President Trump is on television,

417
00:28:09.978 --> 00:28:11.354
grounding the airplane.

418
00:28:11.438 --> 00:28:14.733
I'm gonna be issuing
an emergency order of prohibition


419
00:28:14.816 --> 00:28:20.572
to ground all flights
of the 737 Max 8

420
00:28:20.655 --> 00:28:23.908
and the 737 Max 9.

421
00:28:23.992 --> 00:28:27.036
Any plane currently in the air
will go to its destination


422
00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:30.498
and thereafter be grounded
until further notice.


423
00:28:36.755 --> 00:28:39.215
To my knowledge, it's the only airplane

424
00:28:39.299 --> 00:28:41.968
ever to be grounded
by the president of the United States.


425
00:28:43.094 --> 00:28:46.097
But even after the Max was grounded,

426
00:28:46.181 --> 00:28:49.058
and the planes had to be flown
to storage facilities,


427
00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:53.688
we had pilots calling to say
they don't want to fly them there.


428
00:28:55.398 --> 00:28:59.235
When a pilot doesn't want
to fly a brand-new Boeing,


429
00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:01.821
that's an issue.

430
00:29:20.757 --> 00:29:22.759
Two days after the second crash,

431
00:29:23.259 --> 00:29:25.053
I started an investigation.

432
00:29:26.262 --> 00:29:29.557
We knew something big was afoot here,

433
00:29:29.641 --> 00:29:32.769
that this plane appeared
to be defective in some manner.


434
00:29:33.645 --> 00:29:35.730
I had just hired my investigative staff,
and I said,


435
00:29:35.814 --> 00:29:38.358
"Here's your first job, 
Boeing 737 Max."

436
00:29:40.819 --> 00:29:44.280
In addition to Congress
trying to get to the bottom of this,


437
00:29:44.781 --> 00:29:49.494
the families of the victims
really took this on as a personal issue.


438
00:29:51.246 --> 00:29:54.541
They felt that there
needed to be some explanation


439
00:29:54.624 --> 00:29:58.920
of how two planes could have crashed
within such a short period of time.


440
00:30:01.422 --> 00:30:04.300
The crash families
started coming to DC


441
00:30:05.009 --> 00:30:09.806
to help put pressure on Congress
to hold Boeing responsible.


442
00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:13.893
Peter DeFazio, we're indebted to,

443
00:30:13.977 --> 00:30:16.312
because he made this
the biggest investigation


444
00:30:16.396 --> 00:30:19.607
in the history of the Transportation
Infrastructure Committee.


445
00:30:20.608 --> 00:30:23.862
Paul Njoroge from Kenya lost his wife,

446
00:30:23.945 --> 00:30:25.238
his three children,

447
00:30:26.030 --> 00:30:27.365
and his mother-in-law.

448
00:30:28.241 --> 00:30:30.451
I've been in touch
with the crash families,


449
00:30:30.535 --> 00:30:33.955
and we definitely talk
about how to go about it


450
00:30:34.455 --> 00:30:37.417
and understand what
has to be done to get justice.


451
00:30:40.795 --> 00:30:42.463
This is who we've lost.

452
00:30:44.841 --> 00:30:47.468
This is the cost
of doing business as usual.


453
00:30:49.470 --> 00:30:53.766
I remember looking
at the full list of passenger names


454
00:30:54.601 --> 00:30:57.478
from so many different countries.

455
00:30:57.562 --> 00:31:00.481
People all over the world
have been impacted


456
00:31:00.565 --> 00:31:02.025
by what has taken place.

457
00:31:14.412 --> 00:31:17.081
We want this thing
to come out in the public.


458
00:31:18.207 --> 00:31:20.209
We want Boeing to show all the papers.

459
00:31:20.293 --> 00:31:22.295
We want them to come out
with the true facts.


460
00:31:25.089 --> 00:31:27.592
When we started
the investigation,


461
00:31:27.675 --> 00:31:31.679
a lot of people around the world
were angry and appalled


462
00:31:31.763 --> 00:31:33.514
at what had been allowed to happen.

463
00:31:34.098 --> 00:31:36.059
Do you feel your story is getting out?

464
00:31:36.809 --> 00:31:39.395
I... right now it is
because we're having a hearing.


465
00:31:39.479 --> 00:31:42.106
My concern is that weeks will pass,

466
00:31:42.190 --> 00:31:45.318
and... and the FAA
will just put the plane back in the air


467
00:31:45.401 --> 00:31:46.486
without any scrutiny.

468
00:31:46.569 --> 00:31:48.321
They have the power to do that.

469
00:31:49.238 --> 00:31:51.366
In the United States of America,

470
00:31:51.449 --> 00:31:53.826
Congress has oversight duties,

471
00:31:53.910 --> 00:31:54.911
plain and simple.

472
00:31:55.620 --> 00:32:01.042
And the question was,
did Boeing put an unsafe plane in the air?


473
00:32:01.918 --> 00:32:04.295
Meeting come to order.

474
00:32:04.796 --> 00:32:07.757
We're here today in response
to two catastrophic crashes


475
00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:12.095
that claimed 346 lives
in the span of five months.


476
00:32:12.595 --> 00:32:16.516
We're very much in the beginning
of, uh, our investigation.


477
00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:20.603
I would like to recognize
the family members of those killed,


478
00:32:20.687 --> 00:32:22.689
uh, some of whom are here today,

479
00:32:22.772 --> 00:32:25.858
and we're here to ensure
that the lives of your family members


480
00:32:25.942 --> 00:32:28.945
were not lost, uh,
in vain and without response.


481
00:32:29.445 --> 00:32:33.199
Today, we'll hear from pilots
and other safety professionals


482
00:32:33.282 --> 00:32:35.118
who, uh, work on those planes.

483
00:32:35.785 --> 00:32:38.454
Now, the question is,
what were the factors?


484
00:32:39.247 --> 00:32:43.793
Congress's goal, of course,
was first to lay out for the public


485
00:32:43.876 --> 00:32:45.753
what happened and why,

486
00:32:45.837 --> 00:32:48.923
and secondly,
to look at legislative changes


487
00:32:49.007 --> 00:32:51.175
that could prevent future crashes.

488
00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:54.846
After the second crash occurred,

489
00:32:54.929 --> 00:32:59.308
Boeing was trying to push
the focus onto the Ethiopian pilots.


490
00:32:59.976 --> 00:33:03.271
They acknowledged that MCAS had misfired

491
00:33:03.354 --> 00:33:06.399
but maintained that the Ethiopian crew

492
00:33:06.482 --> 00:33:11.029
did not do everything precisely
as they were supposed to.


493
00:33:12.113 --> 00:33:15.533
It was the same argument
they used with Lion Air,


494
00:33:16.451 --> 00:33:20.997
and they waged a pretty vigorous
public relations campaign


495
00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:23.041
to try to get their point across.

496
00:33:24.083 --> 00:33:28.504
We learned that Boeing's lobbyists
were hiring firms in Washington


497
00:33:28.588 --> 00:33:33.342
to spread the message
that foreign pilots were to blame.


498
00:33:33.843 --> 00:33:37.263
Captain Carey, uh, Ethiopia Air,
the pilot in the right seat


499
00:33:37.346 --> 00:33:40.016
could not fly at our standards here.

500
00:33:40.099 --> 00:33:43.394
We need to look at
their pilot qualifications and training.


501
00:33:43.478 --> 00:33:48.191
You know, Ethiopian Airlines flies a plane
into, uh, Washington Dulles every day


502
00:33:48.274 --> 00:33:50.485
from Addis Ababa,
and they have been doing it for years.


503
00:33:50.568 --> 00:33:52.653
They have a proud aviation culture,

504
00:33:53.279 --> 00:33:56.157
and you have to remember,
uh, sir, and members of the panel,


505
00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:59.035
this is a sudden violent
and terrifying event.


506
00:33:59.952 --> 00:34:02.997
Captain Sullenberger,
is it fair to blame these pilots?


507
00:34:03.081 --> 00:34:06.459
I just don't want to take the easy path
and blame... blame the pilots.


508
00:34:06.959 --> 00:34:09.128
We shouldn't be blaming
the pilots,


509
00:34:09.212 --> 00:34:13.966
and we shouldn't expect pilots
to have to compensate for flawed designs.


510
00:34:14.550 --> 00:34:17.303
These crews would have been fighting
for their lives


511
00:34:17.804 --> 00:34:19.597
in the fight of their lives.

512
00:34:33.528 --> 00:34:35.905
<i>Soon after the hearings
got underway,</i>


513
00:34:35.988 --> 00:34:40.368
<i>we managed to get more information
about what actually happened</i>


514
00:34:40.451 --> 00:34:43.538
<i>in the cockpit of the Ethiopian aircraft.</i>

515
00:34:44.956 --> 00:34:47.792
<i>We got the information from the FAA</i>

516
00:34:47.875 --> 00:34:52.130
<i>within hours after they received it
from the Ethiopian investigators.</i>


517
00:34:54.257 --> 00:34:55.883
<i>It was very late at night,</i>

518
00:34:55.967 --> 00:34:59.303
<i>and we tried to put together
the most comprehensive story we could.</i>


519
00:35:03.474 --> 00:35:04.851
<i>When it came out,</i>

520
00:35:04.934 --> 00:35:08.437
<i>this was the first story that revealed</i>

521
00:35:08.521 --> 00:35:13.234
<i>that the crew, in fact,
realized that MCAS had kicked off.</i>


522
00:35:14.402 --> 00:35:17.196
<i>And they did
what Boeing instructed them to do.</i>


523
00:35:23.995 --> 00:35:25.580
When the MCAS kicks in,

524
00:35:26.789 --> 00:35:28.583
it runs for ten seconds

525
00:35:29.083 --> 00:35:32.170
and pushes the airplane
very powerfully nose-down.


526
00:35:34.922 --> 00:35:37.133
Runs for ten, off for five.

527
00:35:37.884 --> 00:35:40.469
Runs for ten, off for five.

528
00:35:43.306 --> 00:35:46.851
They've got
this cacophony of stick shaker,


529
00:35:46.934 --> 00:35:50.271
master cautions,
airspeed disagree, altitude disagree.


530
00:35:50.855 --> 00:35:53.024
All of these... these warnings going off.

531
00:35:53.816 --> 00:35:58.779
The captain, who's flying the airplane,
is trying to figure out what's gone wrong.


532
00:36:01.073 --> 00:36:05.077
The first officer called out,
"Stab trim cutout switches, Captain."


533
00:36:05.161 --> 00:36:06.662
I think he said it twice.

534
00:36:07.288 --> 00:36:08.706
He did what Boeing said.

535
00:36:09.665 --> 00:36:11.542
He turned off the MCAS system.

536
00:36:12.752 --> 00:36:15.880
I remember reading that,
and I said, "Man, the kid got it right."


537
00:36:16.881 --> 00:36:18.132
"The kid got it right."

538
00:36:19.175 --> 00:36:23.221
The problem now
is that the airplane is going too fast.


539
00:36:24.347 --> 00:36:27.225
And because of the force
on the tail itself,


540
00:36:28.059 --> 00:36:30.978
they cannot manually trim the airplane

541
00:36:31.062 --> 00:36:32.563
to be able to recover.

542
00:36:42.365 --> 00:36:45.743
<i>Terrain. Terrain.
Pull up. Pull up.</i>


543
00:37:14.522 --> 00:37:18.401
The pilots in the first crash
had no inkling.


544
00:37:19.652 --> 00:37:22.071
Their plane was behaving
completely differently


545
00:37:22.154 --> 00:37:26.075
from the way that they had ever seen it,
and they didn't know what to do.


546
00:37:27.618 --> 00:37:29.161
In the Ethiopian airplane,

547
00:37:29.245 --> 00:37:32.581
it was a crew
that had been briefed by Boeing


548
00:37:32.665 --> 00:37:34.917
on how this MCAS system worked.

549
00:37:35.418 --> 00:37:37.920
And they did
what they were supposed to do.


550
00:37:38.671 --> 00:37:40.298
They turned the system off,

551
00:37:41.674 --> 00:37:43.217
and they still crashed.

552
00:37:44.635 --> 00:37:48.639
For Boeing, this was a tremendous problem

553
00:37:49.473 --> 00:37:52.435
and extremely damaging
to their reputation.


554
00:37:53.686 --> 00:37:57.315
A reputation
that had been years in the making.


555
00:38:30.765 --> 00:38:33.476
My father was
a fighter pilot in the Air Force


556
00:38:34.143 --> 00:38:36.062
and an engineer at the Boeing Company.

557
00:38:36.896 --> 00:38:39.648
Boeing was headquartered
here in the Pacific Northwest,


558
00:38:40.483 --> 00:38:43.527
and far and away,
it was Seattle's biggest employer.


559
00:38:45.321 --> 00:38:46.864
The Boeing pay was good,

560
00:38:47.365 --> 00:38:51.410
so my father was able
to provide us a nice house


561
00:38:51.494 --> 00:38:55.581
and, you know, put himself
square in the middle of the middle class.


562
00:38:57.375 --> 00:38:59.668
Boeing was an engineering firm first,

563
00:38:59.752 --> 00:39:02.880
and it had always been engineering-led.

564
00:39:04.048 --> 00:39:07.259
By focusing on quality and innovation,

565
00:39:07.343 --> 00:39:11.263
they created the products
that made Boeing part of America's pride


566
00:39:12.264 --> 00:39:15.476
and had a tremendous impact
on the country's economy.


567
00:39:17.853 --> 00:39:22.775
Boeing's signatures are on some
of the greatest technical advances made


568
00:39:23.359 --> 00:39:24.777
during the 20th century.

569
00:39:25.986 --> 00:39:29.490
Military airplanes,
unmanned vehicles, spacecraft,


570
00:39:29.573 --> 00:39:32.660
and most notably,
commercial passenger jets,


571
00:39:33.327 --> 00:39:36.831
starting in the late '50s with the 707.

572
00:39:38.499 --> 00:39:41.085
That was followed by the 727

573
00:39:41.669 --> 00:39:44.338
and then the workhorse
of the fleet, the 737.


574
00:39:45.798 --> 00:39:47.925
There was just amazing engineering

575
00:39:48.008 --> 00:39:49.593
that was coming out of Seattle.

576
00:39:50.719 --> 00:39:54.223
Boeing's history of safety
and quality first


577
00:39:54.306 --> 00:39:57.518
was something that the American public
came to understand.


578
00:39:58.769 --> 00:40:01.564
People knew that if it's a Boeing plane,

579
00:40:01.647 --> 00:40:02.940
they felt safe.

580
00:40:04.859 --> 00:40:06.944
It was the dawn of the Jet Age,

581
00:40:07.528 --> 00:40:09.196
and Boeing excelled at it.

582
00:40:10.281 --> 00:40:14.243
They were cranking out
new modern airplanes one after the other.


583
00:40:15.703 --> 00:40:20.249
And then, in the late '60s,
Boeing took an almost unimaginable risk.


584
00:40:20.916 --> 00:40:22.396
<i>The mostest of everything</i>

585
00:40:22.460 --> 00:40:26.046
<i>describes the new giant
of commercial aviation, the jetliner 747.</i>


586
00:40:26.547 --> 00:40:31.886
<i>Contrasted with conventional aircraft,
the 747 will carry 490 passengers.</i>


587
00:40:31.969 --> 00:40:35.473
<i>Its engines will be
twice as powerful as today's airliners.</i>


588
00:40:35.556 --> 00:40:38.726
<i>The first of these great birds
will be delivered by the Boeing Company</i>


589
00:40:38.809 --> 00:40:41.353
<i>to Pan American Airways in 1969.</i>

590
00:40:43.147 --> 00:40:46.525
The 747 program was a moon shot.

591
00:40:48.235 --> 00:40:51.697
Boeing bet on itself
to put together a fantastic airplane.


592
00:40:52.823 --> 00:40:56.619
And they'd said it's gonna be the safest.
It's gonna be the most innovative.


593
00:40:56.702 --> 00:40:58.287
It's gonna be the best.

594
00:41:00.247 --> 00:41:03.250
The 747 revolutionized air travel.

595
00:41:04.168 --> 00:41:06.879
For the very first time,
it became affordable


596
00:41:06.962 --> 00:41:09.340
for people to travel internationally,

597
00:41:09.423 --> 00:41:11.550
and it brought the world closer together.

598
00:41:14.470 --> 00:41:16.305
The moon shots like the 747

599
00:41:17.014 --> 00:41:19.016
are what put
the Boeing Company on the map.


600
00:41:20.476 --> 00:41:24.355
It was, we're gonna do this at all cost.
Whatever it costs, we're gonna do it.


601
00:41:27.274 --> 00:41:29.985
I worked
for the Boeing Company for 32 years.


602
00:41:30.486 --> 00:41:33.030
It was a culture of mutual trust,

603
00:41:33.531 --> 00:41:37.201
and we're in this together,
building a quality-engineered product


604
00:41:37.284 --> 00:41:38.619
that makes us all proud.

605
00:41:38.702 --> 00:41:40.788
- That looks good.
- Okay? Thank you.


606
00:41:43.332 --> 00:41:47.336
When I was working for Boeing,
they came out with this team-wear for us,


607
00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:49.797
and it had the Boeing logo on it.

608
00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:53.425
You know, and at first, we're like,
"Pfft, you know, who wants team-wear?"


609
00:41:53.509 --> 00:41:56.929
But it was amazing
when you actually put that shirt on,


610
00:41:57.012 --> 00:41:58.347
and you go out in public.

611
00:41:58.931 --> 00:42:02.476
And I can't tell you how many people
that were just, "Oh my God,


612
00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:04.478
you work for Boeing. 
That is wonderful."

613
00:42:04.562 --> 00:42:05.980
Looking good, Don.

614
00:42:06.063 --> 00:42:08.190
And it really instilled
a lot of pride.


615
00:42:08.274 --> 00:42:12.570
Perfect!

616
00:42:12.653 --> 00:42:14.363
All right, all right. 
Good job, you guys!

617
00:42:14.446 --> 00:42:16.966
- There it is, first one.
- First one.


618
00:42:18.492 --> 00:42:22.121
I really loved working there
because I had a say.


619
00:42:22.204 --> 00:42:23.831
And when something wasn't right,

620
00:42:23.914 --> 00:42:26.750
I could bring it up,
and I wasn't afraid of being fired.


621
00:42:28.127 --> 00:42:30.879
Boeing management
knew that safety came first,


622
00:42:30.963 --> 00:42:33.841
and if we'd said, "Hey, it's not safe.
It's not ready to fly,"


623
00:42:33.924 --> 00:42:35.092
we're... we're not going.

624
00:42:37.803 --> 00:42:41.473
The culture back then
was we're all in this together,


625
00:42:41.557 --> 00:42:43.892
and, you know,
Boeing's gonna look out for you,


626
00:42:43.976 --> 00:42:46.520
and we expect you
to look out for Boeing.

627
00:42:46.604 --> 00:42:48.522
Now will you please join me
in welcoming


628
00:42:48.606 --> 00:42:52.610
the 777 division vice president
and general manager, Alan Mulally.


629
00:42:53.944 --> 00:42:55.654
So, good morning to you all.

630
00:42:56.697 --> 00:42:59.950
There was a sense
of belonging and a sense of structure


631
00:43:00.034 --> 00:43:02.119
and a sense of family.

632
00:43:02.911 --> 00:43:03.996
We were a family.

633
00:43:04.079 --> 00:43:06.165
We've come a long way together.

634
00:43:06.248 --> 00:43:08.709
It was
an excellent company to work for.


635
00:43:11.670 --> 00:43:16.216
And then, imagine coming into work,
and you got a whole new set of bosses,


636
00:43:16.300 --> 00:43:19.762
and everything you've learned
in 30 years is now wrong.


637
00:43:19.845 --> 00:43:23.307
Good evening, everyone.
It is a multibillion-dollar deal


638
00:43:23.390 --> 00:43:26.143
that is sending shock waves
through the aerospace industry.


639
00:43:26.226 --> 00:43:28.103
The planned merger
between the Boeing Company


640
00:43:28.187 --> 00:43:29.313
and McDonnell Douglas.

641
00:43:29.897 --> 00:43:33.567
The thought that was going through my head
as I walked up here was, "Wow."


642
00:43:33.651 --> 00:43:39.406
I will serve as the chairman
and CEO of the company.


643
00:43:39.490 --> 00:43:42.618
Harry Stonecipher will serve
as the president


644
00:43:42.701 --> 00:43:45.412
and chief operating officer
of the company.


645
00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:48.290
And our intention, like we expect

646
00:43:48.374 --> 00:43:51.877
of everyone in the organization
is to work together.


647
00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:54.838
And with that, I'd like
to introduce Harry Stonecipher. Harry.


648
00:43:56.173 --> 00:43:57.341
Thank you, Phil.

649
00:43:57.424 --> 00:43:58.676
Ladies and gentlemen...

650
00:43:59.176 --> 00:44:03.597
The 1996 acquisition
of McDonnell Douglas by Boeing


651
00:44:03.681 --> 00:44:06.809
was part and parcel
of what was happening across the country.


652
00:44:08.018 --> 00:44:10.729
Merger, buyouts, consolidation.

653
00:44:11.230 --> 00:44:15.442
That was the way companies viewed
their ability to stay competitive.


654
00:44:16.610 --> 00:44:19.571
Boeing's place in the aviation industry

655
00:44:19.655 --> 00:44:20.823
was preeminent.

656
00:44:20.906 --> 00:44:22.199
They were the gold standard.

657
00:44:22.282 --> 00:44:25.202
They were the people you looked up to
for their engineering excellence.


658
00:44:26.161 --> 00:44:31.041
But that began to fall apart
when McDonnell Douglas and Boeing merged.


659
00:44:32.793 --> 00:44:36.714
Harry Stonecipher
was the CEO of McDonnell Douglas,


660
00:44:36.797 --> 00:44:40.551
and he ended up
the CEO of the Boeing Company.


661
00:44:41.260 --> 00:44:43.095
So, pretty quickly,

662
00:44:43.178 --> 00:44:46.390
McDonnell Douglas
became in charge at the very top.


663
00:44:47.891 --> 00:44:51.061
This was following
on the heels of the 1980s


664
00:44:51.645 --> 00:44:53.731
when cash was king on Wall Street.

665
00:44:54.606 --> 00:44:56.233
You know, uh, "Greed is good."

666
00:44:59.153 --> 00:45:04.032
When Harry Stonecipher took over,
he believed that the most important thing


667
00:45:04.116 --> 00:45:07.202
was to take a company
and create value on Wall Street.


668
00:45:07.703 --> 00:45:09.830
He said, "Hey,
we're in business to make money."


669
00:45:10.330 --> 00:45:15.085
I want to hear about product and margin.
I want to hear that it's cost-effective.


670
00:45:16.712 --> 00:45:18.505
The McDonnell Douglas leadership

671
00:45:18.589 --> 00:45:20.841
took Boeing
in a more accelerated direction


672
00:45:20.924 --> 00:45:23.510
toward being a financially driven company.

673
00:45:24.261 --> 00:45:26.388
Wall Street demanded
its shareholder returns.


674
00:45:26.472 --> 00:45:30.642
And they wanted Boeing
to act like a big industrial company


675
00:45:30.726 --> 00:45:32.436
that delivered those returns.

676
00:45:34.563 --> 00:45:36.440
Not long after the merger,

677
00:45:36.523 --> 00:45:39.568
there was a major campaign launched

678
00:45:39.651 --> 00:45:40.903
called ShareValue.

679
00:45:41.695 --> 00:45:46.074
And the idea was that they wanted
everybody to be aware of the stock price,


680
00:45:46.575 --> 00:45:50.454
and they wanted everybody working together
to increase the stock value.


681
00:45:52.331 --> 00:45:53.749
Even the technical meetings,

682
00:45:53.832 --> 00:45:56.752
everything revolved
around Boeing stock prices.


683
00:45:58.212 --> 00:46:01.423
To turn around and see
the McDonnell Douglas executives


684
00:46:01.507 --> 00:46:04.301
bringing their business plan
into the Boeing Company,


685
00:46:04.384 --> 00:46:05.469
that upset a lot of us.

686
00:46:06.303 --> 00:46:08.806
We knew back then
that that was a bad plan.


687
00:46:10.098 --> 00:46:14.019
They drove the company as if it was
making washing machines, for instance.


688
00:46:14.102 --> 00:46:15.604
Dishwashers.

689
00:46:16.188 --> 00:46:19.817
All the airplanes had to be
manufactured more cheaply.


690
00:46:20.984 --> 00:46:23.529
They were reducing
the number of people working,


691
00:46:23.612 --> 00:46:25.989
expecting everyone to do more with less.

692
00:46:28.033 --> 00:46:31.161
We saw the company
changing before our eyes.


693
00:46:33.664 --> 00:46:37.167
You know, I'd been working there
in the Seattle area for a long time,


694
00:46:37.251 --> 00:46:39.795
and the environment
that we ended up merging with


695
00:46:40.379 --> 00:46:41.755
was so different.

696
00:46:42.339 --> 00:46:44.842
McDonnell Douglas was
the good old boys' network.


697
00:46:45.801 --> 00:46:49.304
They weren't respectful
of our processes for our employees.


698
00:46:50.764 --> 00:46:55.477
And then we were told they were moving
the headquarters to Chicago.


699
00:46:55.561 --> 00:46:58.188
<i>It is official.
Boeing is confirming that it's moving</i>


700
00:46:58.272 --> 00:47:00.482
<i>its new international headquarters
to Chicago.</i>


701
00:47:01.149 --> 00:47:04.903
And all of us that had been there
more than a week was like, "You're crazy."


702
00:47:05.487 --> 00:47:10.367
Because back then, Boeing was Seattle,
and Seattle was Boeing. I mean they were...


703
00:47:11.076 --> 00:47:12.202
They were lockstep.

704
00:47:12.703 --> 00:47:14.580
We looked at all the data,

705
00:47:14.663 --> 00:47:18.375
and we believe that Chicago
is the best choice for Boeing.


706
00:47:21.253 --> 00:47:23.755
One of the arguments
for moving to Chicago


707
00:47:23.839 --> 00:47:28.302
was to gain separation
from the technical people back in Seattle


708
00:47:29.428 --> 00:47:32.514
so that executives
could make financial decisions


709
00:47:32.598 --> 00:47:36.560
without as much pushback
from, um, engineers.


710
00:47:37.978 --> 00:47:41.064
Before McDonnell Douglas,
we just didn't take shortcuts


711
00:47:41.148 --> 00:47:43.442
'cause it just wasn't the Boeing culture.

712
00:47:43.525 --> 00:47:44.525
No shortcuts.

713
00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:46.778
You do it right,

714
00:47:46.862 --> 00:47:49.072
and you build in
the quality and the safety,


715
00:47:49.156 --> 00:47:50.449
and the profits will follow.

716
00:47:51.783 --> 00:47:53.535
But all that changed,

717
00:47:54.036 --> 00:47:55.913
and it was just heartbreaking.

718
00:47:57.706 --> 00:48:00.918
I think we all tried
to appease ourselves by saying,


719
00:48:01.001 --> 00:48:03.295
"Well, maybe we're just upset
because it's a change."


720
00:48:04.963 --> 00:48:08.842
But in reality, our gut concerns
were really valid at the time.


721
00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:12.679
That... that this was going to affect
the company in... in ways


722
00:48:12.763 --> 00:48:14.890
that we couldn't... couldn't even imagine.

723
00:48:17.434 --> 00:48:18.852
It's been a bad year for Boeing

724
00:48:18.936 --> 00:48:22.105
and a better year
for its European competitor, Airbus.


725
00:48:22.189 --> 00:48:25.567
For the year, Boeing has 368 new orders,

726
00:48:25.651 --> 00:48:28.236
and Airbus has 427.

727
00:48:28.862 --> 00:48:31.323
By the time that the merger
in 1997 happened,


728
00:48:31.990 --> 00:48:35.535
the competition had just chipped away
at the market share


729
00:48:36.203 --> 00:48:39.164
that Boeing had fought
to acquire over decades.


730
00:48:40.499 --> 00:48:45.128
Boeing found themselves
in a very unusual position.


731
00:48:46.380 --> 00:48:49.466
They were being challenged
by other manufacturers,


732
00:48:49.549 --> 00:48:53.095
and that pressure was primarily coming
from the Europeans,


733
00:48:54.012 --> 00:48:55.097
meaning Airbus.

734
00:48:56.348 --> 00:48:58.684
Over the years,
there has been a lot


735
00:48:58.767 --> 00:49:01.353
of bad blood between Boeing and Airbus.

736
00:49:02.479 --> 00:49:04.022
But here's the thing about Airbus,

737
00:49:04.106 --> 00:49:06.233
it didn't happen overnight

738
00:49:06.316 --> 00:49:09.653
that it became
this incredible force in the industry.


739
00:49:10.529 --> 00:49:12.864
It happened one little piece at a time.

740
00:49:13.532 --> 00:49:15.951
It was a slow build,

741
00:49:16.034 --> 00:49:18.036
little by little, little by little,

742
00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:22.958
so that by 2003, Airbus ended up
overtaking Boeing's market share.


743
00:49:24.418 --> 00:49:25.752
Boeing was behind.

744
00:49:25.836 --> 00:49:27.462
Boeing needed to catch up.

745
00:49:28.630 --> 00:49:32.926
So they started to push
even harder to get the airplanes out.


746
00:49:33.510 --> 00:49:38.974
And over time, the laser focus
on safety that had been traditional


747
00:49:39.683 --> 00:49:40.726
was compromised.

748
00:49:44.563 --> 00:49:47.941
My job
at Boeing was quality manager.


749
00:49:48.859 --> 00:49:51.299
If something's not right,
you need to find it and get it fixed


750
00:49:51.361 --> 00:49:52.361
or get it corrected.

751
00:49:53.530 --> 00:49:57.117
To ensure safety, finding things
was what you're supposed to do.


752
00:49:58.952 --> 00:50:02.497
But instead of fixing problems,
everything was about speed.


753
00:50:02.581 --> 00:50:06.960
Everything was about getting stuff done.
Let's move it. Let's get it done.


754
00:50:07.044 --> 00:50:08.920
You can't stop. 
You can't slow down.

755
00:50:10.088 --> 00:50:12.758
Used to be
when you raise your hand and say,


756
00:50:12.841 --> 00:50:14.217
"We got a problem here,"

757
00:50:14.301 --> 00:50:17.095
they would say,
"Yeah, you're right. We're gonna fix it."


758
00:50:17.179 --> 00:50:19.681
After the merger with McDonnell Douglas

759
00:50:19.765 --> 00:50:21.308
and the Airbus coming on,

760
00:50:21.808 --> 00:50:23.977
Boeing quit listening to their employees.

761
00:50:24.644 --> 00:50:27.522
So every time I'd raise my hand and say,
"Hey, we got a problem here,"


762
00:50:27.606 --> 00:50:29.441
they would attack the messenger

763
00:50:29.941 --> 00:50:32.402
and... and ignore the message.

764
00:50:33.445 --> 00:50:36.615
Historically, Boeing was
a culture of telling bad news.


765
00:50:36.698 --> 00:50:39.618
They discussed concerns freely
in building planes.


766
00:50:40.243 --> 00:50:41.787
Now it became a problem

767
00:50:41.870 --> 00:50:43.997
that you do not bring
bad news to the boss.


768
00:50:44.956 --> 00:50:47.125
Boeing had highly-paid CEOs,

769
00:50:47.626 --> 00:50:50.003
whose main incentive was
to increase the stock price


770
00:50:50.837 --> 00:50:52.380
and to please Wall Street.

771
00:50:54.549 --> 00:50:58.595
These CEOs demanded
that all their managers hit their marks,


772
00:50:58.678 --> 00:51:00.388
and they don't care how they do that.

773
00:51:02.724 --> 00:51:05.018
So I guess
to speed up production,


774
00:51:05.102 --> 00:51:09.106
they got quality inspectors,
quality managers out of the picture.


775
00:51:10.440 --> 00:51:12.484
A mechanic could speed up his job

776
00:51:13.068 --> 00:51:17.489
by doing the work and then just saying
to the guy next to him, "Approve this


777
00:51:17.572 --> 00:51:19.324
so that I can move
on to the next spot."

778
00:51:20.117 --> 00:51:21.952
Between me and you,

779
00:51:22.035 --> 00:51:24.496
they didn't put a shim
on the landing gear yesterday.


780
00:51:24.579 --> 00:51:26.915
On the lugs. Night shift didn't.

781
00:51:26.998 --> 00:51:28.208
Oh, fuck.

782
00:51:28.291 --> 00:51:31.628
They said we don't have time
to fucking put it on.


783
00:51:32.254 --> 00:51:34.506
They have,
like, one quality person


784
00:51:34.589 --> 00:51:37.384
for almost a whole building on each shift.

785
00:51:38.260 --> 00:51:41.263
We used to have, you know, 15.

786
00:51:42.931 --> 00:51:45.308
I was getting
complaints about debris.


787
00:51:46.101 --> 00:51:50.272
Every day, we were finding crap
on airplanes that people were leaving.


788
00:51:50.772 --> 00:51:52.941
There was drawings, tools,

789
00:51:53.733 --> 00:51:54.776
fasteners.

790
00:51:55.485 --> 00:51:57.320
There was this one 787,

791
00:51:57.988 --> 00:51:59.239
and after a test flight,

792
00:51:59.739 --> 00:52:02.617
they found a ladder
inside the horizontal stabilizer.


793
00:52:03.243 --> 00:52:07.038
All it would have taken was that ladder
to fall up against the jackscrew assembly,


794
00:52:07.122 --> 00:52:09.583
and that... that plane
would have been history.


795
00:52:12.878 --> 00:52:16.840
These are pictures
of metal shavings in wire bundles.


796
00:52:17.716 --> 00:52:21.678
These shavings can cause
a... a fire or a short.


797
00:52:22.971 --> 00:52:25.182
And these aircraft fly by wire,

798
00:52:25.265 --> 00:52:27.851
so if you have a... a short,

799
00:52:28.393 --> 00:52:30.854
it could cause malfunctions
in your instruments,


800
00:52:30.937 --> 00:52:34.941
in your landing gear. I mean, everything
that runs by wire would be affected.


801
00:52:37.277 --> 00:52:39.196
Boeing whistleblowers have said

802
00:52:39.279 --> 00:52:43.325
that anybody that reported
a problem at the South Carolina plant


803
00:52:43.408 --> 00:52:44.492
was either fired

804
00:52:45.577 --> 00:52:47.579
or let go or moved on.

805
00:52:49.539 --> 00:52:53.210
My pay was docked
for putting quality concerns in writing.


806
00:52:54.294 --> 00:52:58.006
They told us flat out they do not want
anything in documentation


807
00:52:58.089 --> 00:53:00.717
so they can maintain culpable deniability.

808
00:53:02.010 --> 00:53:04.054
They don't want anything documented.

809
00:53:16.775 --> 00:53:19.819
There are a lot of questions
that still remain unanswered,


810
00:53:19.903 --> 00:53:23.073
and Boeing has yet to provide
a single document.


811
00:53:23.156 --> 00:53:27.327
I'm hoping they will provide
the documents we've requested voluntarily,


812
00:53:27.827 --> 00:53:29.913
uh, and in the not-too-distant future.

813
00:53:30.705 --> 00:53:33.041
From the start
of the investigation,


814
00:53:33.124 --> 00:53:35.377
Boeing has been
very difficult to deal with


815
00:53:35.460 --> 00:53:38.171
in terms of interviews and/or documents.

816
00:53:39.589 --> 00:53:41.424
They have essentially ignored

817
00:53:41.508 --> 00:53:43.301
the families of the victims.

818
00:53:46.137 --> 00:53:49.266
Boeing has never reached out
to us directly.


819
00:53:50.725 --> 00:53:54.688
It communicates their lack of remorse,
their lack of accountability.


820
00:53:55.480 --> 00:53:57.065
And that's infuriating.

821
00:53:59.526 --> 00:54:01.778
For them, it was business as usual.

822
00:54:02.529 --> 00:54:05.907
But we're the ones
who were trying to make sure that


823
00:54:05.991 --> 00:54:09.160
other families never have to deal
with what we're dealing with.


824
00:54:10.996 --> 00:54:16.334
We've met with, I don't know,

825
00:54:17.711 --> 00:54:18.545
It's hard.

826
00:54:18.628 --> 00:54:23.133
You go, and you relive this

827
00:54:24.843 --> 00:54:26.720
and talk about your daughter dying.

828
00:54:30.390 --> 00:54:34.019
When we held up
pictures of our lost loved ones


829
00:54:34.102 --> 00:54:37.188
in the hearing room, we were told,
"You're not supposed to do that."


830
00:54:37.272 --> 00:54:39.232
"They're like protest signs."

831
00:54:40.358 --> 00:54:42.777
And we said, "They're not protest signs."

832
00:54:43.403 --> 00:54:44.904
"They're our loved ones."

833
00:54:47.866 --> 00:54:52.412
I personally have probably been
at s... seven hearings.


834
00:54:52.495 --> 00:54:55.915
Good afternoon. Thank you
for inviting me to testify today.


835
00:54:56.416 --> 00:54:58.084
My name is Ed Pierson.

836
00:54:58.168 --> 00:55:01.129
I believe production problems
at the Renton Factory


837
00:55:01.212 --> 00:55:04.215
may have contributed
to these two tragic crashes.


838
00:55:04.924 --> 00:55:09.137
I formally warned Boeing leadership
in writing on multiple occasions,


839
00:55:09.220 --> 00:55:11.931
specifically once
before the Lion Air crash


840
00:55:12.015 --> 00:55:14.267
and again
before the Ethiopian Airlines crash.


841
00:55:15.101 --> 00:55:18.355
Those warnings were ignored. 
On June 9th...

842
00:55:18.438 --> 00:55:23.151
We've heard
lots of testimony about the 737 Max,


843
00:55:24.361 --> 00:55:27.739
but the committee wanted
actual documents from Boeing.


844
00:55:29.115 --> 00:55:31.785
No documents had been received, nothing.

845
00:55:31.868 --> 00:55:34.371
We fully expect
at a future hearing


846
00:55:34.454 --> 00:55:35.997
to have Boeing into this committee,

847
00:55:36.081 --> 00:55:39.459
uh, once we have, uh,
the documentation digested


848
00:55:39.542 --> 00:55:43.713
that we need to ask the meaningful,
very pointed questions we will ask.


849
00:55:44.297 --> 00:55:48.468
I was really frustrated. I thought
that Boeing was dragging its feet.


850
00:55:50.470 --> 00:55:54.391
When will you talk to Boeing
as part of your ongoing investigation?


851
00:55:54.474 --> 00:55:57.685
I really, uh, want to have
documents from Boeing


852
00:55:57.769 --> 00:56:01.940
before I call them as a witness so we get
the meaningful information we want


853
00:56:02.023 --> 00:56:04.359
and not just a
pile of stuff this high.

854
00:56:05.068 --> 00:56:07.570
Congress expected answers.

855
00:56:07.654 --> 00:56:10.865
The families of the victims
expected answers.


856
00:56:12.450 --> 00:56:17.080
But Boeing actively tried
to keep emails and documents


857
00:56:17.163 --> 00:56:20.417
and internal memos
out of the public domain.


858
00:56:28.466 --> 00:56:32.512
You know, they say aircraft crashes
are a combination of events


859
00:56:32.595 --> 00:56:34.514
that all come together uniquely.

860
00:56:36.015 --> 00:56:38.435
In this case, one of those events

861
00:56:38.518 --> 00:56:41.229
was back when Boeing
lost its competitive edge.


862
00:56:42.564 --> 00:56:45.191
These days,
Boeing finds itself facing turbulence


863
00:56:45.275 --> 00:56:46.985
caused not by the weather

864
00:56:47.068 --> 00:56:49.654
but by a foreign rival
with some very big ambitions.


865
00:56:50.238 --> 00:56:54.117
<i>Airbus now leads the world
in building commercial airplanes,</i>


866
00:56:54.200 --> 00:56:58.163
<i>a big stick in the eye to America
and to the Boeing Corporation.</i>


867
00:56:59.164 --> 00:57:02.542
In the 2000s,
Airbus was on a roll.


868
00:57:03.251 --> 00:57:06.421
They had several years
of selling more planes than Boeing.


869
00:57:07.255 --> 00:57:08.506
And that raised eyebrows.

870
00:57:09.007 --> 00:57:12.218
<i>In 1999,
Boeing delivered 620 planes.</i>


871
00:57:12.302 --> 00:57:14.053
<i>Last year, 285.</i>

872
00:57:15.305 --> 00:57:17.640
And then, in 2010,

873
00:57:18.391 --> 00:57:21.394
Airbus introduced the A320neo.

874
00:57:24.272 --> 00:57:30.904
For carriers, the ultimate goal,
of course, is maximum fuel efficiency.


875
00:57:31.863 --> 00:57:36.242
A big part of an airline's cost
is what they paid for fuel.


876
00:57:37.702 --> 00:57:40.079
Oil prices
had gone to record levels.


877
00:57:40.163 --> 00:57:43.458
Airlines were saying, "We need
fuel efficiency, and we need it now."


878
00:57:44.125 --> 00:57:45.502
And Airbus delivered.

879
00:57:46.294 --> 00:57:47.879
The 320neo.

880
00:57:48.421 --> 00:57:51.132
You scored an absolute home run

881
00:57:51.216 --> 00:57:56.137
by making that decision to get out there
and offer it before Boeing.


882
00:57:56.221 --> 00:58:01.100
No airplane in aviation history
has ever sold so quickly and so well.


883
00:58:02.894 --> 00:58:07.982
Back in Chicago, the neo
sent Boeing into a panic


884
00:58:08.066 --> 00:58:10.109
because they didn't have
a plane ready to compete.


885
00:58:11.736 --> 00:58:14.280
Boeing thought
about a new aircraft,


886
00:58:14.364 --> 00:58:17.659
but the price tag
would have been significant.


887
00:58:18.493 --> 00:58:21.079
And they didn't have the luxury

888
00:58:21.162 --> 00:58:26.000
of taking seven, eight, ten years
to develop a brand-new plane.


889
00:58:28.962 --> 00:58:33.091
So instead, they decided to put
more fuel-efficient engines


890
00:58:33.591 --> 00:58:35.969
on the existing 737 model.

891
00:58:37.011 --> 00:58:39.097
We are making a decision

892
00:58:39.180 --> 00:58:42.016
to invest in the 737 family.

893
00:58:42.100 --> 00:58:44.477
We are announcing the 737 Max.

894
00:58:45.687 --> 00:58:49.691
The 737 Max gives our airline customers

895
00:58:49.774 --> 00:58:51.651
the most efficient airplane

896
00:58:52.318 --> 00:58:53.987
in the single-aisle segment.

897
00:58:55.446 --> 00:58:58.700
We were disappointed.
We wanted a new airplane.


898
00:58:59.492 --> 00:59:03.496
We really believed the 37 had...
was long in the tooth and had...


899
00:59:03.580 --> 00:59:06.791
We had squeezed as much
as we possibly could from that airplane.


900
00:59:07.292 --> 00:59:09.961
I mean, the design
was over 40 years old.

901
00:59:15.133 --> 00:59:19.596
The 737 had been flying
for more than four decades,


902
00:59:20.179 --> 00:59:23.266
and different versions
of them had been developed.


903
00:59:24.142 --> 00:59:26.102
A little bit better of an engine,

904
00:59:26.603 --> 00:59:27.937
digital cockpits,

905
00:59:28.563 --> 00:59:29.772
a little longer.

906
00:59:30.690 --> 00:59:36.070
The 737 Max was seen
as a slightly updated,


907
00:59:36.154 --> 00:59:38.823
more fuel-efficient version
of the same plane.


908
00:59:40.074 --> 00:59:41.576
For a manufacturer,

909
00:59:42.076 --> 00:59:43.995
the advantage of these derivatives,

910
00:59:44.078 --> 00:59:45.496
as they're called,

911
00:59:45.580 --> 00:59:49.917
was they required less time
to get approved by the FAA.


912
00:59:52.086 --> 00:59:54.672
And the added benefit to the airlines

913
00:59:54.756 --> 00:59:58.551
was you might not need
any additional pilot training.


914
00:59:59.260 --> 01:00:02.680
Training pilots is
a major cost of operating an airline.


915
01:00:03.264 --> 01:00:07.393
Despite how expensive the airplanes are,
it's the people that cost the most.


916
01:00:07.477 --> 01:00:10.980
And training pilots
is a major piece of that pie.


917
01:00:12.523 --> 01:00:16.819
If the Max turned out
to be too different from the existing 737,


918
01:00:17.487 --> 01:00:19.739
that would have triggered immediately

919
01:00:19.822 --> 01:00:21.532
an FAA red flag.

920
01:00:22.533 --> 01:00:25.161
And simulator training
would be required fleet-wide


921
01:00:25.244 --> 01:00:26.704
for all Max pilots.

922
01:00:28.790 --> 01:00:31.542
We're talking about
devoted simulator training,


923
01:00:32.043 --> 01:00:34.170
taking pilots off the flight line,

924
01:00:34.253 --> 01:00:36.089
not having them fly passengers.

925
01:00:36.714 --> 01:00:38.841
Getting them to come
into a training center


926
01:00:38.925 --> 01:00:42.053
and sit for, whatever,
two days in a simulator.


927
01:00:43.096 --> 01:00:46.057
So when Boeing
was designing the Max,


928
01:00:46.557 --> 01:00:48.851
in order to remain competitive,

929
01:00:48.935 --> 01:00:51.104
they made guarantees to the airlines

930
01:00:51.604 --> 01:00:54.315
that their pilots
wouldn't need simulator training.


931
01:00:55.608 --> 01:00:57.276
The strategy worked,

932
01:00:57.777 --> 01:01:00.363
and the 737 Max sold phenomenally well.

933
01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:04.742
Boeing got orders
for hundreds and hundreds of airplanes.


934
01:01:04.826 --> 01:01:08.663
This is the largest firm order
that we've ever gotten,


935
01:01:09.163 --> 01:01:12.625
in terms of number of airplanes
and also the value of this deal.


936
01:01:12.709 --> 01:01:15.294
So, truly another historical day for us.

937
01:01:16.963 --> 01:01:19.674
Boeing thought
that they could do this project


938
01:01:19.757 --> 01:01:21.592
very quickly and very cheaply.

939
01:01:21.676 --> 01:01:23.678
That it wouldn't take much effort.

940
01:01:24.178 --> 01:01:26.514
They just thought
a little bit of tweak to the structure,


941
01:01:26.597 --> 01:01:30.643
and you can stick an engine on there
and lengthen the landing gear,


942
01:01:30.727 --> 01:01:32.019
and you're good to go.

943
01:01:34.772 --> 01:01:38.109
And because there could be
no additional pilot training,


944
01:01:38.818 --> 01:01:40.945
there was tons of motivation
within the company


945
01:01:41.028 --> 01:01:44.907
to either build a design
that doesn't have significant differences


946
01:01:46.159 --> 01:01:49.495
or potentially to cover up
a design that does.


947
01:02:10.475 --> 01:02:15.688
We had to go through
very lengthy negotiations with Boeing


948
01:02:15.772 --> 01:02:17.398
to receive documents.

949
01:02:18.065 --> 01:02:21.027
We had engaged the House attorneys here,

950
01:02:21.569 --> 01:02:23.738
and then we finally started getting

951
01:02:24.447 --> 01:02:28.493
the first of the hundreds of thousands
of pages of documents that they gave us.


952
01:02:33.498 --> 01:02:35.500
And my investigative staff

953
01:02:35.583 --> 01:02:37.251
started going through it.

954
01:02:41.756 --> 01:02:44.801
Virtually everything
was stamped "proprietary,"


955
01:02:45.468 --> 01:02:48.137
and it took quite some time
to come to an agreement


956
01:02:48.221 --> 01:02:51.891
so we could reveal
the contents of those documents.


957
01:02:54.685 --> 01:03:00.316
And I think the reason is
because they are so damning on their face.


958
01:03:01.734 --> 01:03:04.028
In that massive tranche of documents,

959
01:03:04.612 --> 01:03:06.572
one was particularly telling.

960
01:03:08.574 --> 01:03:11.077
We found out
that a group of Boeing employees


961
01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:15.706
had held a meeting
and discussed the MCAS system.


962
01:03:17.041 --> 01:03:21.087
This memo, discovered
by the committee, and this is early on


963
01:03:21.170 --> 01:03:22.755
in the development of the aircraft,

964
01:03:22.839 --> 01:03:27.343
revealed that the MCAS system
was a problem for Boeing


965
01:03:27.426 --> 01:03:28.845
from the very beginning.

966
01:03:30.221 --> 01:03:32.014
Back in 2013,

967
01:03:32.098 --> 01:03:35.226
when Boeing was just starting
to build the Max,


968
01:03:35.309 --> 01:03:38.354
they were re-engining
a 45-year-old airframe


969
01:03:38.855 --> 01:03:41.816
with these giant,
new fuel-efficient engines.


970
01:03:42.525 --> 01:03:44.652
Because these engines are bigger,

971
01:03:45.152 --> 01:03:49.198
they had to be positioned further forward
and higher up on the wings.


972
01:03:49.866 --> 01:03:53.244
And so Boeing was worried about the plane

973
01:03:53.327 --> 01:03:56.539
getting into, uh, too much of a nose-up,

974
01:03:57.039 --> 01:03:59.292
and then the plane could stall.

975
01:04:00.459 --> 01:04:03.129
So, if it starts to pitch up,

976
01:04:03.212 --> 01:04:07.008
MCAS was designed
to help the pilot level the plane out.


977
01:04:09.510 --> 01:04:13.598
The problem was
MCAS was a significant new system


978
01:04:13.681 --> 01:04:18.227
and could prompt the FAA
to require some additional training.


979
01:04:19.061 --> 01:04:21.898
So, what's the solution
in th... in this memo?


980
01:04:23.149 --> 01:04:26.861
They said, "If we emphasize
MCAS is a new function,


981
01:04:27.612 --> 01:04:30.907
there may be greater certification
and training impact."


982
01:04:32.074 --> 01:04:35.494
Everybody at Boeing knew
you can't have pilot retraining.


983
01:04:35.578 --> 01:04:38.122
No matter what we do,
no matter how we change this plane,


984
01:04:38.205 --> 01:04:42.335
we've gotta pretend
it's the same plane as the predecessor.


985
01:04:44.295 --> 01:04:46.130
So they decided,

986
01:04:46.213 --> 01:04:50.760
"Externally, we would communicate
it is an addition to Speed Trim."


987
01:04:51.385 --> 01:04:56.182
Speed Trim is the existing system,
which pilots had already been trained on.


988
01:04:57.433 --> 01:05:01.062
"Internally continue using
the acronym MCAS."


989
01:05:02.688 --> 01:05:05.608
They determined
that they would conceal the existence


990
01:05:05.691 --> 01:05:09.654
to anybody, uh, outside
of Boeing of the MCAS system.


991
01:05:12.657 --> 01:05:16.369
Once these documents
became public, it showed


992
01:05:16.452 --> 01:05:20.498
that there were major, big issues
broiling under the surface


993
01:05:21.082 --> 01:05:25.211
and a widespread pattern
inside Boeing of deceitful behavior.


994
01:05:26.587 --> 01:05:32.134
This next piece of evidence was one
of the most important specific documents


995
01:05:32.218 --> 01:05:35.805
relating to the design of the plane
and of the MCAS system.


996
01:05:37.139 --> 01:05:41.352
It shows that MCAS changed
over the course of the design.


997
01:05:42.478 --> 01:05:46.482
Boeing didn't end up with the same system
that they started out with.


998
01:05:47.274 --> 01:05:50.027
To begin with,
it became much more powerful.


999
01:05:51.988 --> 01:05:55.950
It wasn't until Boeing got
into flight testing that they realized


1000
01:05:56.033 --> 01:05:59.537
that they actually had to expand
how the MCAS system worked.


1001
01:06:00.371 --> 01:06:03.582
They thought at first that it was
only gonna be for when the airplane


1002
01:06:03.666 --> 01:06:04.917
was at high speeds.

1003
01:06:06.377 --> 01:06:09.588
But what became clear
was that the Max needed MCAS


1004
01:06:09.672 --> 01:06:12.758
when the airplane
was flying at low speeds as well.


1005
01:06:14.176 --> 01:06:16.762
And it was this transition
to low-speed handling


1006
01:06:16.846 --> 01:06:19.807
that made the system far more significant.

1007
01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:24.437
The result was
is that MCAS gained more power.


1008
01:06:25.479 --> 01:06:27.982
So it had the ability
to make larger movements


1009
01:06:28.065 --> 01:06:29.567
of the horizontal stabilizer,

1010
01:06:30.067 --> 01:06:33.571
which could push the nose
of the airplane down very quickly.


1011
01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:41.412
In addition
to this increased power of the system,


1012
01:06:41.495 --> 01:06:45.499
there was a second change,
something even more problematic.


1013
01:06:46.417 --> 01:06:51.881
Boeing changed the MCAS system
to only use one sensor instead of two.


1014
01:06:55.217 --> 01:06:58.512
It turns out
this way more powerful system


1015
01:06:58.596 --> 01:07:02.391
was controlled
by just one angle-of-attack sensor.


1016
01:07:03.559 --> 01:07:06.729
The MCAS system is safety-critical.

1017
01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:10.733
And on an airplane, you never ever have

1018
01:07:10.816 --> 01:07:15.654
a safety-critical system
that has a single point of failure.


1019
01:07:17.156 --> 01:07:18.783
The angle-of-attack sensors

1020
01:07:19.283 --> 01:07:22.828
protrude out of either side
of the fuselage, near the cockpit.


1021
01:07:23.829 --> 01:07:26.874
If a happy-birthday Mylar balloon

1022
01:07:26.957 --> 01:07:30.211
gets stuck on that vane,
it becomes unreliable.


1023
01:07:32.129 --> 01:07:34.882
Believe it or not,
we hit balloons, we hit birds,


1024
01:07:35.382 --> 01:07:39.762
uh, and all of these things,
uh, are not uncommon.


1025
01:07:41.639 --> 01:07:44.767
If that sensor
is damaged or faulty,


1026
01:07:45.351 --> 01:07:48.479
it will send a wrong message
to the MCAS system,


1027
01:07:48.562 --> 01:07:51.816
which then tries to take over
the plane from the pilots.


1028
01:07:53.776 --> 01:07:58.239
None of this
was communicated by anybody at Boeing


1029
01:07:58.322 --> 01:08:03.410
to the FAA engineer
who was in charge of oversight,


1030
01:08:03.994 --> 01:08:05.788
and yeah, it should have been.

1031
01:08:06.539 --> 01:08:08.749
The FAA
was kept out of the loop.


1032
01:08:09.458 --> 01:08:11.502
Usually, there's a constant negotiation

1033
01:08:12.002 --> 01:08:15.297
between... between a regulator
and the regulated


1034
01:08:15.381 --> 01:08:17.883
about what parts of the airplane
are gonna change.


1035
01:08:19.593 --> 01:08:21.470
But in the case of Boeing,

1036
01:08:21.554 --> 01:08:23.681
they had a culture of concealment,

1037
01:08:24.223 --> 01:08:28.352
deliberate concealment
regarding the MCAS system.


1038
01:08:29.812 --> 01:08:32.314
And the evidence kept mounting.

1039
01:08:36.485 --> 01:08:39.113
Coordination sheets
are technical documents


1040
01:08:39.196 --> 01:08:41.907
written to archive information.

1041
01:08:43.868 --> 01:08:48.873
This coord sheet
is capturing the history of MCAS.


1042
01:08:50.374 --> 01:08:52.751
This is basically
about the safety issues


1043
01:08:52.835 --> 01:08:55.045
that were analyzed inside Boeing,

1044
01:08:55.754 --> 01:08:58.799
and the most relevant part of this dealt

1045
01:08:58.883 --> 01:09:01.510
with how quickly pilots
would be able to react


1046
01:09:01.594 --> 01:09:03.387
if the system went haywire.

1047
01:09:05.931 --> 01:09:08.851
I haven't seen
this particular coord sheet before.


1048
01:09:09.852 --> 01:09:10.852
Hmm.

1049
01:09:14.190 --> 01:09:17.151
With pilot training
to recognize the runaway,


1050
01:09:17.234 --> 01:09:20.779
a reaction time scenario
greater than ten seconds


1051
01:09:20.863 --> 01:09:23.073
found the failure to be catastrophic.

1052
01:09:24.533 --> 01:09:26.118
So if you don't respond

1053
01:09:26.202 --> 01:09:30.581
in less than ten seconds
to this situation,


1054
01:09:31.290 --> 01:09:32.458
you can't recover.

1055
01:09:33.167 --> 01:09:34.335
Ten seconds,

1056
01:09:35.252 --> 01:09:38.005
which is ridiculous.

1057
01:09:40.382 --> 01:09:43.344
But the problem here
is not just the reaction time.


1058
01:09:43.886 --> 01:09:46.555
The problem here is
the term "pilot training."


1059
01:09:47.890 --> 01:09:51.936
It says, "With pilot training
to recognize the runaway,"


1060
01:09:52.770 --> 01:09:55.898
they're saying
that we can't just throw pilots at this


1061
01:09:55.981 --> 01:09:58.525
without awareness of the system.

1062
01:09:59.235 --> 01:10:03.697
And... which... which that's
the real "gotcha" right in this statement.


1063
01:10:04.907 --> 01:10:10.079
Pilots need to be trained on MCAS
to potentially avoid killing people.


1064
01:10:11.664 --> 01:10:14.208
And Boeing knew that this was the case.

1065
01:10:15.751 --> 01:10:18.003
And yet pilot training never happened.

1066
01:10:23.008 --> 01:10:27.680
Our reporting and the memos
and documents that had been released


1067
01:10:27.763 --> 01:10:31.392
revealed an underbelly,
an underside of the company.


1068
01:10:32.559 --> 01:10:37.690
In this March 28, 2017,
internal Boeing communication,


1069
01:10:38.190 --> 01:10:42.528
the chief technical pilot
for the 737 Max writes,


1070
01:10:42.611 --> 01:10:45.447
"I want to stress
the importance of holding firm


1071
01:10:45.531 --> 01:10:49.785
that there will not be
any type of simulator training required."


1072
01:10:50.869 --> 01:10:53.664
"Boeing will not allow that to happen."

1073
01:10:54.415 --> 01:10:59.086
"We'll go face-to-face with any regulator
who tries to make that a requirement."


1074
01:11:00.379 --> 01:11:01.839
The tragedy of it is,

1075
01:11:01.922 --> 01:11:05.592
some of these emails
were actually conversations with Lion Air.


1076
01:11:06.635 --> 01:11:10.306
In a June 6, 2017 email exchange,

1077
01:11:10.389 --> 01:11:13.017
which took place
the year before the crash,


1078
01:11:13.100 --> 01:11:16.729
Lion Air says,
in effect, wouldn't it be better,


1079
01:11:16.812 --> 01:11:19.940
wouldn't it be safer
to have some additional training?


1080
01:11:20.441 --> 01:11:23.527
We want more
than you're... you're recommending.


1081
01:11:24.862 --> 01:11:28.741
And Boeing writes, flat out,
"There is absolutely no reason


1082
01:11:28.824 --> 01:11:31.827
to require a Max simulator
to begin flying the Max."


1083
01:11:33.662 --> 01:11:37.333
If they had said
what the true power of MCAS was,


1084
01:11:38.083 --> 01:11:42.921
simulator training would be required
fleet-wide for all 737 Max pilots.


1085
01:11:44.131 --> 01:11:47.259
Instead, Boeing literally mocked Lion Air,

1086
01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:50.721
mocked them for wanting
to have simulator training.


1087
01:11:52.765 --> 01:11:55.642
Boeing had to,
you know, berate them.


1088
01:11:56.143 --> 01:11:59.646
"You cannot have simulator training."

1089
01:11:59.730 --> 01:12:02.066
"You can't do it.
It costs money. We lose money."


1090
01:12:03.567 --> 01:12:08.781
They talked about Jedi-mind tricking
regulators around the world


1091
01:12:09.531 --> 01:12:14.745
into adopting the standard
of no simulator training required.


1092
01:12:15.704 --> 01:12:19.875
So, we're supposed to react
in less than ten seconds


1093
01:12:19.958 --> 01:12:24.171
to a system that's never been
on any airplane we've ever flown before.


1094
01:12:25.214 --> 01:12:30.177
Boeing knew pilots had
a monster waiting for them


1095
01:12:30.260 --> 01:12:31.470
in the MCAS system,

1096
01:12:32.304 --> 01:12:35.808
but they conspire to <i>not</i> offer training.

1097
01:12:37.351 --> 01:12:38.351
It's just

1098
01:12:39.269 --> 01:12:40.729
unconscionable to me.

1099
01:12:40.813 --> 01:12:42.856
It just...

1100
01:12:43.941 --> 01:12:44.941
It's nuts.

1101
01:12:49.154 --> 01:12:51.490
In the end, Boeing succeeded,

1102
01:12:52.449 --> 01:12:55.369
and when the plane
was delivered to airlines,


1103
01:12:55.452 --> 01:12:59.206
it didn't appear from the outside

1104
01:12:59.289 --> 01:13:02.501
that there was something
fundamentally wrong with the aircraft.


1105
01:13:04.086 --> 01:13:07.089
I mean, they were making sales
all over the world.


1106
01:13:11.343 --> 01:13:14.471
Boeing sold over 5,000 Maxes.

1107
01:13:15.097 --> 01:13:16.557
It's an unbelievable number.

1108
01:13:17.683 --> 01:13:21.186
It really was the product
that brought the financial performance


1109
01:13:21.270 --> 01:13:24.398
on Wall Street up to a... a level
that Boeing had never seen before.


1110
01:13:25.357 --> 01:13:27.359
Boeing's profit soared.

1111
01:13:28.152 --> 01:13:30.737
The stock value went through the roof.

1112
01:13:31.613 --> 01:13:33.282
And that was the whole idea.

1113
01:13:33.866 --> 01:13:37.202
Performance was being judged
in quarterly returns,


1114
01:13:37.953 --> 01:13:39.288
and the Max delivered.

1115
01:13:40.706 --> 01:13:45.169
The 737 Max was going to be
the major meal ticket for Boeing


1116
01:13:45.252 --> 01:13:46.420
for coming decades.

1117
01:13:46.503 --> 01:13:49.298
This is a company
that, yeah, 500's a reasonable number.


1118
01:13:49.381 --> 01:13:52.301
And it was seen as a sure thing.

1119
01:13:57.931 --> 01:14:00.601
Unprecedented value
for our customers,


1120
01:14:00.684 --> 01:14:03.687
in terms of saving fuel,
in terms of being reliable,


1121
01:14:03.770 --> 01:14:05.355
in terms of being maintainable.

1122
01:14:05.439 --> 01:14:07.900
And you know what we've done?
We've created an airplane


1123
01:14:07.983 --> 01:14:11.778
that's gonna exceed their expectations
by any way you measure it.


1124
01:14:13.655 --> 01:14:16.825
Everyone thought
that the good times would never end.


1125
01:14:20.245 --> 01:14:23.207
And then, in October of 2018, they did.

1126
01:14:32.257 --> 01:14:34.718
The Lion Air pilots
not only didn't know


1127
01:14:34.801 --> 01:14:36.345
how this system worked,

1128
01:14:36.428 --> 01:14:38.805
they didn't know the name of the system.

1129
01:14:39.306 --> 01:14:44.019
They didn't even know
that the MCAS system was on the aircraft.


1130
01:14:47.147 --> 01:14:50.484
You just got the airplane
into the air, and all of a sudden, bang,


1131
01:14:50.567 --> 01:14:53.320
all these bells and warnings
and whistles and stick shaker going off.


1132
01:14:53.403 --> 01:14:54.723
<i>Airspeed low.</i>

1133
01:14:55.447 --> 01:14:59.451
An angle-of-attack sensor,
which had either failed or was damaged,


1134
01:14:59.535 --> 01:15:02.496
was sending a bad input to the cockpit.

1135
01:15:02.579 --> 01:15:04.957
It would have taken
more than a few seconds certainly


1136
01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:07.960
for the pilots to determine
what the cause was.


1137
01:15:09.253 --> 01:15:12.297
And then as soon
as the flaps were retracted,


1138
01:15:13.715 --> 01:15:15.968
MCAS was activated.

1139
01:15:19.388 --> 01:15:20.973
You started the clock, right?

1140
01:15:21.056 --> 01:15:23.141
One Mississippi, two Mississippi,

1141
01:15:23.225 --> 01:15:24.309
three Mississippi...

1142
01:15:27.312 --> 01:15:31.525
The way MCAS
kept pushing the nose of the airplane down


1143
01:15:31.608 --> 01:15:32.943
was maniacal.

1144
01:15:33.026 --> 01:15:35.696
And the pilots never understood

1145
01:15:35.779 --> 01:15:37.906
it was trying to kill them.

1146
01:15:38.699 --> 01:15:42.035
<i>Terrain. Terrain.
Pull up. Pull up.</i>


1147
01:15:44.997 --> 01:15:46.415
You've got ten seconds,

1148
01:15:48.125 --> 01:15:49.960
which is impossible.

1149
01:15:51.920 --> 01:15:54.840
So basically, ten seconds, you're dead.

1150
01:15:58.218 --> 01:16:01.430
<i>Terrain. Terrain.
Pull up. Pull up.</i>


1151
01:16:20.365 --> 01:16:23.619
We now know
that within few days of the crash,


1152
01:16:23.702 --> 01:16:25.662
Boeing knew what the problem was.

1153
01:16:27.331 --> 01:16:28.915
They knew what he had faced,

1154
01:16:28.999 --> 01:16:31.543
what my husband
had to go through in that flight.


1155
01:16:33.712 --> 01:16:36.340
Boeing knew what the problems were
with MCAS.


1156
01:16:37.341 --> 01:16:39.468
It's not that they
were not aware of it.

1157
01:16:41.219 --> 01:16:43.347
There should be a sense of responsibility.

1158
01:16:46.350 --> 01:16:47.809
Here in the US,

1159
01:16:47.893 --> 01:16:51.104
they never seriously considered
grounding the aircraft.


1160
01:16:52.189 --> 01:16:54.149
After the first crash,

1161
01:16:54.650 --> 01:16:56.485
Boeing was all about,

1162
01:16:56.568 --> 01:17:00.280
how can we justify
keeping the planes flying?


1163
01:17:02.658 --> 01:17:06.828
We didn't know
at the time that after the Lion Air crash,


1164
01:17:06.912 --> 01:17:10.540
the FAA had done a very technical analysis

1165
01:17:10.624 --> 01:17:11.625
called a TARAM.

1166
01:17:13.001 --> 01:17:14.544
TARAM. T
-A
-R
-A
-M.

1167
01:17:14.628 --> 01:17:18.090
A Transport Aircraft
Risk Assessment Methodology.


1168
01:17:19.299 --> 01:17:22.552
They've projected
that there could be, without a fix,


1169
01:17:22.636 --> 01:17:24.721
15 more crashes

1170
01:17:25.597 --> 01:17:27.307
of this aircraft during its life.

1171
01:17:29.851 --> 01:17:34.481
They projected that
there could be as many as one fatal crash


1172
01:17:34.564 --> 01:17:37.067
every two years of a Max.

1173
01:17:38.318 --> 01:17:42.155
That would make the Max
the most dangerous modern jet ever built.


1174
01:17:46.368 --> 01:17:48.912
At the time,
nobody heard about this report.


1175
01:17:50.205 --> 01:17:51.540
It wasn't made public.

1176
01:17:53.083 --> 01:17:57.337
But we verified
that Boeing knew about the results


1177
01:17:57.421 --> 01:18:00.340
at the same time
that the FAA knew about them.


1178
01:18:02.217 --> 01:18:05.262
Boeing argued that it's never possible

1179
01:18:05.345 --> 01:18:08.515
to actually predict
the timing of another crash


1180
01:18:09.015 --> 01:18:12.436
and that they would have a software fix

1181
01:18:12.519 --> 01:18:16.314
developed and tested
and implemented very quickly.


1182
01:18:18.066 --> 01:18:21.445
And in the end,
the FAA accepted Boeing's argument.


1183
01:18:23.613 --> 01:18:27.033
There were people, a few people,
at Boeing who rang alarm bells,


1184
01:18:27.117 --> 01:18:28.577
but they were ignored.

1185
01:18:29.745 --> 01:18:31.621
Up there in the executive offices,

1186
01:18:31.705 --> 01:18:35.125
they were watching the stock price
and calculating their bonuses.


1187
01:18:37.085 --> 01:18:39.713
Just six weeks
after the Lion Air crash,


1188
01:18:39.796 --> 01:18:43.091
the Boeing board decided
to increase stock buybacks


1189
01:18:43.175 --> 01:18:44.426
and increase dividends.

1190
01:18:45.302 --> 01:18:47.304
Total disregard for what happened.

1191
01:18:47.387 --> 01:18:52.517
All of our customers are flying
all of their Maxes daily around the world.


1192
01:18:52.601 --> 01:18:55.604
The airplane is safe,
and we're very confident in that.


1193
01:18:58.023 --> 01:19:00.400
It's the corporate culture
that they had built up.


1194
01:19:00.484 --> 01:19:01.818
It was their greed.

1195
01:19:03.528 --> 01:19:06.490
Are the profits
more important than the human life?


1196
01:19:23.381 --> 01:19:25.801
You know,
once they got the TARAM report,


1197
01:19:26.468 --> 01:19:28.887
Boeing should have grounded the Max.

1198
01:19:30.263 --> 01:19:31.473
They didn't do that.

1199
01:19:33.099 --> 01:19:35.685
This was after the Lion Air crash,

1200
01:19:35.769 --> 01:19:37.187
before my daughter died.

1201
01:19:38.688 --> 01:19:40.398
They let it go up in the air.

1202
01:19:43.318 --> 01:19:45.779
I think
that is the most disturbing


1203
01:19:45.862 --> 01:19:48.406
and most revealing part
of the whole story.


1204
01:19:49.783 --> 01:19:54.246
Boeing did the absolute least
that they could do


1205
01:19:54.830 --> 01:19:58.041
to cope with this situation.
The absolute minimum.


1206
01:19:59.626 --> 01:20:04.756
Basically, they were betting
that the problem would not reoccur


1207
01:20:04.840 --> 01:20:07.551
before a permanent fix
could be implemented.


1208
01:20:09.344 --> 01:20:12.347
And of course
that turned out to be a fatal mistake.


1209
01:20:15.976 --> 01:20:18.520
It's just a horrible, horrible story.

1210
01:20:34.035 --> 01:20:36.997
Boeing's failure
to do everything they could do


1211
01:20:37.080 --> 01:20:41.084
to prevent the second crash
made our lives miserable.


1212
01:20:42.502 --> 01:20:44.838
And this isn't just about Samya
and our family.


1213
01:20:44.921 --> 01:20:47.716
It's about everybody
that died on those planes.


1214
01:20:49.759 --> 01:20:52.804
And so, in October of 2019,

1215
01:20:52.888 --> 01:20:55.348
when Muilenburg was scheduled to testify

1216
01:20:55.432 --> 01:20:56.766
at the Senate hearing,

1217
01:20:57.601 --> 01:21:00.228
we were all highly motivated to be there.

1218
01:21:06.026 --> 01:21:08.111
Muilenburg walks in,

1219
01:21:08.194 --> 01:21:09.237
and for a moment,

1220
01:21:10.030 --> 01:21:12.157
he glanced at us, at the families,

1221
01:21:14.075 --> 01:21:16.369
but he never really looked at us.

1222
01:21:24.085 --> 01:21:30.258
A lot of the testimony that day was
about the internal Boeing communications.


1223
01:21:31.551 --> 01:21:33.929
You're the CEO. 
The buck stops with you.

1224
01:21:34.012 --> 01:21:35.639
Did you read this document?

1225
01:21:36.306 --> 01:21:41.019
And how did your team not run in
with their hair on fire,


1226
01:21:41.686 --> 01:21:43.980
saying, "We got a real problem here."

1227
01:21:44.481 --> 01:21:48.860
Senator, when I was made aware
of the existence of this kind of document,


1228
01:21:48.944 --> 01:21:52.197
I relied on our counsel to provide that
to the appropriate authorities.


1229
01:21:53.031 --> 01:21:54.616
How did you not say,

1230
01:21:54.699 --> 01:21:57.118
"We need to figure out
exactly what happened,


1231
01:21:57.702 --> 01:22:00.413
not after all the hearings,
not after the pressure,


1232
01:22:00.497 --> 01:22:03.583
but because people have died
and we don't want another person to die."


1233
01:22:03.667 --> 01:22:06.878
Senator, as... as you mentioned, uh... uh,

1234
01:22:06.962 --> 01:22:10.382
I didn't, uh, see the details
of this exchange until recently.


1235
01:22:10.966 --> 01:22:14.427
Our family at that time
still had heard nothing from Boeing.


1236
01:22:15.720 --> 01:22:18.348
We had heard Dennis Muilenburg

1237
01:22:19.182 --> 01:22:21.768
apologize to cameras

1238
01:22:23.395 --> 01:22:24.729
but never to us.

1239
01:22:24.813 --> 01:22:27.983
We began work on an MCAS software update
in that time frame.


1240
01:22:28.692 --> 01:22:31.611
When Senator Blumenthal's time
came to question,


1241
01:22:31.695 --> 01:22:35.281
he asked the family members to stand up

1242
01:22:35.365 --> 01:22:37.742
and hold their loved ones' pictures.

1243
01:22:37.826 --> 01:22:41.788
To the relatives who have lost loved ones,

1244
01:22:41.871 --> 01:22:44.040
if you could please stand.

1245
01:22:44.708 --> 01:22:46.793
And at that point,

1246
01:22:47.293 --> 01:22:51.089
Dennis Muilenburg had to turn around
and look at us.


1247
01:23:31.921 --> 01:23:33.840
In the 21st century,

1248
01:23:34.466 --> 01:23:38.053
to lose two planes
within months of each other


1249
01:23:38.136 --> 01:23:39.763
and kill so many people,

1250
01:23:40.263 --> 01:23:42.974
it just never ever ever
should have happened.


1251
01:23:45.018 --> 01:23:47.395
The safety culture at Boeing fell apart.

1252
01:23:48.646 --> 01:23:50.690
It was corrupted from the top down

1253
01:23:50.774 --> 01:23:53.234
by pressures from Wall Street,
plain and simple.


1254
01:23:54.110 --> 01:23:55.528
Mr. Muilenburg,

1255
01:23:55.612 --> 01:23:58.323
we have seen
that, you know, pressures from Wall Street


1256
01:23:58.406 --> 01:24:02.410
have a way of influencing the decisions
of the best companies in the worst way,


1257
01:24:03.369 --> 01:24:06.039
endangering the public,
jeopardizing the good work


1258
01:24:06.122 --> 01:24:09.459
of countless, countless
hardworking employees


1259
01:24:09.542 --> 01:24:10.960
on the factory lines.

1260
01:24:11.669 --> 01:24:15.006
And I hope that's not the story
that is ultimately, uh, gonna be written


1261
01:24:15.090 --> 01:24:18.051
about this long-admired company.

1262
01:24:33.983 --> 01:24:35.902
<i>I've thought
about this story a lot</i>


1263
01:24:36.402 --> 01:24:39.197
<i>in terms of what it means
and what it will mean.</i>


1264
01:24:40.865 --> 01:24:44.202
<i>Some of the mistakes
that Boeing made were irreparable.</i>


1265
01:24:46.246 --> 01:24:49.916
<i>The people who died
and their families and their friends</i>


1266
01:24:49.999 --> 01:24:52.544
<i>and the lives that ended in tragedy,</i>

1267
01:24:53.044 --> 01:24:54.838
<i>those can never be repaired.</i>

1268
01:25:03.054 --> 01:25:05.056
<i>How many times
have you heard companies say,</i>


1269
01:25:05.140 --> 01:25:06.599
<i>"We're committed to excellence."</i>

1270
01:25:06.683 --> 01:25:10.228
<i>"We're committed to safety.
We're committed to our customers."</i>


1271
01:25:11.521 --> 01:25:14.691
<i>But no matter how big the company is
and how sophisticated</i>


1272
01:25:14.774 --> 01:25:18.736
<i>and what a fantastic past it had,
which is all true for Boeing,</i>


1273
01:25:19.404 --> 01:25:20.780
<i>we should be skeptical.</i>

1274
01:25:23.199 --> 01:25:24.993
<i>All of us should be skeptical.</i>

1275
01:25:41.217 --> 01:25:44.387
The Boeing 737 Max planes
now back in the air.


1276
01:25:44.470 --> 01:25:46.866
Flight happening today
for the first time in nearly two years


1277
01:25:46.890 --> 01:25:48.330
after the planes, they were grounded

1278
01:25:48.391 --> 01:25:51.561
following two fatal crashes
that killed hundreds of people.


1279
01:25:51.644 --> 01:25:54.189
Yesterday, we spoke
exclusively with Dave Calhoun,


1280
01:25:54.272 --> 01:25:56.524
the president and CEO of Boeing.

1281
01:25:56.608 --> 01:26:00.695
We don't want to hide anything
because we're proud of what we do.


1282
01:26:00.778 --> 01:26:04.240
The products that we make are incredible.
They're good for humanity.


1283
01:26:04.324 --> 01:26:07.619
And I'm very proud of our team,
and I'm very proud of that airplane.


1284
01:26:07.702 --> 01:26:09.829
It is a, uh, remarkable machine

1285
01:26:09.913 --> 01:26:12.332
and as safe
as anything... anything in the air.
