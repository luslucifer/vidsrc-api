1
00:00:21.725 --> 00:00:24.460
No, no, no.

2
00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.297
- Um...
- I found the dress, Nina!


3
00:00:27.397 --> 00:00:31.802
Fucking meth heads, this is a size four.
It's a plus size dress.


4
00:00:31.902 --> 00:00:33.804
It would probably fit you.

5
00:00:34.204 --> 00:00:37.125
Anything else, or is this...

6
00:00:37.922 --> 00:00:40.059
a wasted day?

7
00:00:54.491 --> 00:00:56.927
Isn't it divine?

8
00:00:57.027 --> 00:00:58.662
It's Prada.

9
00:00:58.762 --> 00:01:01.164
Isn't it divine?

10
00:01:01.951 --> 00:01:04.132
It's Prada!

11
00:01:05.635 --> 00:01:08.138
Isn't it divine?

12
00:01:08.238 --> 00:01:10.535
It's Prada!

13
00:01:10.874 --> 00:01:15.349
Nina gave it to me just for being super
cool, plus it didn't fit any of the models.


14
00:01:15.478 --> 00:01:18.482
Oh, my God, it's fucking hot in here.

15
00:01:19.582 --> 00:01:21.651
- Smells like ass.
- I'm cold.


16
00:01:21.751 --> 00:01:23.412
Make-up.

17
00:01:23.512 --> 00:01:26.736
Effortless chic. 
Come on, please?

18
00:01:26.836 --> 00:01:29.326
Please, you're so good at it!

19
00:01:29.826 --> 00:01:32.796
- No.
- Come on.


20
00:01:32.896 --> 00:01:35.362
Get up, get up, get up.

21
00:01:38.158 --> 00:01:40.211
Come on, do my face.

22
00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.707
I don't know how you work
in the fashion industry.


23
00:01:43.807 --> 00:01:46.543
They totally objectify women.

24
00:01:46.643 --> 00:01:48.876
Says the fat girl.

25
00:01:50.914 --> 00:01:53.172
I'm not fat.

26
00:01:54.384 --> 00:01:56.686
Actually, you're not.
You're just not toned.


27
00:01:56.786 --> 00:01:59.289
You just need to do some Pilates.
Some leg lifts.


28
00:01:59.389 --> 00:02:02.025
Yeah. 'Cause I never eat.

29
00:02:02.125 --> 00:02:05.184
I don't know how you do that.

30
00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.102
Come out with me tonight.

31
00:02:13.202 --> 00:02:14.971
No.

32
00:02:15.071 --> 00:02:17.274
Rob will be there.

33
00:02:17.974 --> 00:02:21.578
- So?
- What the fuck is wrong with you?


34
00:02:21.678 --> 00:02:24.205
You know I, it's...

35
00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:29.211
- He's nice, and he likes you.
- You would know.


36
00:02:29.311 --> 00:02:32.889
Yeah, I would. He did nothing
but talk about you the other night.


37
00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:37.449
- Yeah, that's not all he did.
- Ouch! Bitch!


38
00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:41.939
Nothing happened but a little rubbing.
He came and then we passed out.


39
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.737
Admit it, he makes your pussy wet.

40
00:02:47.837 --> 00:02:52.790
Mm-hmm. He does, yeah, he do.

41
00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:59.341
- Oh, come on, admit it, you like him.
- All right, yeah, I do.


42
00:03:00.249 --> 00:03:02.263
A little.

43
00:03:03.947 --> 00:03:07.980
- Just stay away.
- You're not down for my sloppy seconds?


44
00:03:08.858 --> 00:03:12.551
Oh, girl, come on, 
I'm just joking.

45
00:03:13.363 --> 00:03:17.133
Okay, the other night I was
fucked up, I wasn't thinking.


46
00:03:17.233 --> 00:03:21.104
- You know how I get.
- Yeah, I do.


47
00:03:21.204 --> 00:03:24.130
I promise, I'll keep my hands off.

48
00:03:24.708 --> 00:03:26.676
Pinky swear.

49
00:03:26.776 --> 00:03:28.801
Pinky swear.

50
00:03:36.886 --> 00:03:40.824
- Oh, come out with me tonight.
- No, you stay in with me. Huh?


51
00:03:40.924 --> 00:03:43.560
We'll make popcorn
and we'll watch A Time to Kill.


52
00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.664
Girl, you know Matthew McConaughey
makes me splash.


53
00:03:48.264 --> 00:03:50.367
- Brownies?
- Stop it.


54
00:03:50.467 --> 00:03:52.902
- Ice cream?
- Jill.


55
00:03:53.002 --> 00:03:55.305
Cold sweet pink wine.

56
00:03:55.405 --> 00:03:58.241
- Barbecue potato chips.
- Cool Whip.


57
00:03:58.341 --> 00:04:01.378
Gummy Bears, french fries.

58
00:04:01.478 --> 00:04:03.780
- Chili.
- Sour cream.


59
00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.805
- And butter.
- And mayonnaise.


60
00:04:08.685 --> 00:04:11.554
- Pop tarts.
- With chili...


61
00:04:11.654 --> 00:04:15.959
and sour cream, and butter,
and mayonnaise.


62
00:04:19.996 --> 00:04:21.820
Oh.

63
00:04:36.162 --> 00:04:40.322
Come stay here with me.

64
00:04:43.152 --> 00:04:46.389
God. Don't be such a boring bitch!

65
00:04:46.489 --> 00:04:49.715
- Come out with me.
- I can't.


66
00:04:52.228 --> 00:04:55.587
Fine. Just do my face.

67
00:07:04.193 --> 00:07:06.485
Lifestyle and attitudes...

68
00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:17.173
The beautiful, the bored, the broken.

69
00:07:17.273 --> 00:07:19.198
They are my muses.

70
00:07:41.364 --> 00:07:44.526
- Dinner is served, bitches.
- It's bouillon.


71
00:07:44.626 --> 00:07:46.541
It's all they eat in...

72
00:07:46.641 --> 00:07:49.707
Hey, you know what? 
I do not need...

73
00:07:51.107 --> 00:07:54.911
- Right?
- But she looked amazing. Amazing!


74
00:07:55.011 --> 00:07:56.769
No.

75
00:08:03.319 --> 00:08:06.489
- I heard that this is all she eats.
- Oh, please.


76
00:08:06.589 --> 00:08:09.826
It's cut, cut, snip, snip. Ga, Ga, right?

77
00:08:09.926 --> 00:08:13.418
Whatev. I applaud her effort.

78
00:08:18.134 --> 00:08:20.459
Self control.

79
00:08:21.971 --> 00:08:26.232
- The discipline.
- Oh, come on, she still has work to do.


80
00:08:56.072 --> 00:08:59.142
There are olives in this drink.
You saw me eat the bouillon.


81
00:08:59.242 --> 00:09:02.067
Are you trying to sabotage me, Adriana?

82
00:09:03.679 --> 00:09:06.338
You are so good at this.

83
00:09:40.249 --> 00:09:44.576
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

84
00:09:45.721 --> 00:09:48.424
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.


85
00:09:48.524 --> 00:09:50.229
Yeah?

86
00:09:50.329 --> 00:09:53.752
Too much to drink or did you try
some of the bouillon?


87
00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:57.367
I don't know what that is.

88
00:09:57.467 --> 00:10:01.493
I think it's soup. 
I think it's soup.

89
00:10:07.176 --> 00:10:10.067
I'm not really good at networking.

90
00:10:10.579 --> 00:10:14.842
Well, everyone here seems to be
pretty preoccupied. So, good job.


91
00:10:18.988 --> 00:10:24.761
It's like, have you ever seen that,
uh, Last Year at Marienbad?


92
00:10:24.861 --> 00:10:30.266
- What's that?
- It's a movie, black and white. Um, yes...


93
00:10:30.366 --> 00:10:35.476
- No, tell me. I don't watch a lot of movies.
- Never mind. Me too. I don't either.


94
00:10:39.842 --> 00:10:43.004
So anyway, are you gonna tell me?

95
00:10:43.104 --> 00:10:45.047
You gonna...

96
00:10:45.147 --> 00:10:48.507
- Please?
- Um...


97
00:10:51.287 --> 00:10:53.770
Everyone talks in...

98
00:10:54.405 --> 00:10:58.184
riddles. 'Cause they're not real,
they're just like fragments,


99
00:10:58.284 --> 00:11:00.997
like symbols,
or like fragments of memories.


100
00:11:01.097 --> 00:11:04.971
Or what, I don't even know.
It's totally post modern.


101
00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:10.896
Whoa. What? Uh...

102
00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:23.608
You coming back to the party?

103
00:11:25.287 --> 00:11:28.992
- Oh, shit, shit.
- What?


104
00:11:29.192 --> 00:11:33.630
I said your name's Jill, right?
It's your party?


105
00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:36.966
No, it's not. No. Not really.

106
00:11:37.066 --> 00:11:41.537
- I just insulted your friends.
- Nope. They're Jennifer's friends.


107
00:11:41.837 --> 00:11:44.807
- Yeah.
- I only met one cute girl here tonight.


108
00:11:44.907 --> 00:11:49.101
Listen, nothing Jennifer
says about me is true.


109
00:11:52.815 --> 00:11:56.819
- You should look for her.
- What, what, what did you say?


110
00:11:57.119 --> 00:12:00.189
- You should look for her!
- I am.


111
00:12:00.289 --> 00:12:02.514
Have you seen her?

112
00:12:02.992 --> 00:12:05.561
Nobody in here but me.

113
00:12:05.661 --> 00:12:07.821
I know.

114
00:12:07.921 --> 00:12:10.579
So are you coming back to the party?

115
00:12:19.692 --> 00:12:22.183
Come on, let yourself go.

116
00:12:38.027 --> 00:12:41.388
Hey, I hope it wasn't something I said.

117
00:12:52.408 --> 00:12:55.044
No, no, it wasn't you.

118
00:12:55.344 --> 00:12:57.069
Are you okay?

119
00:13:05.354 --> 00:13:09.124
All right. I guess we're done
talking for now.


120
00:13:09.224 --> 00:13:11.794
I think that's a good idea.

121
00:13:11.894 --> 00:13:16.172
Well, when you're done in there,
you come find me. Or I'll come find you.


122
00:13:21.036 --> 00:13:23.261
Feel better.

123
00:14:05.197 --> 00:14:07.555
No, no, no.

124
00:14:09.585 --> 00:14:11.343
Come on.

125
00:14:12.221 --> 00:14:14.479
Oh, God.

126
00:14:18.427 --> 00:14:20.252
Hey.

127
00:14:21.897 --> 00:14:25.368
I was gonna get a rag
to clean that up, but I...


128
00:14:25.968 --> 00:14:28.704
I passed out. I'm sorry.

129
00:14:29.004 --> 00:14:31.330
Oh. All right.

130
00:14:33.359 --> 00:14:35.351
Is that my T-shirt?

131
00:14:37.646 --> 00:14:40.149
Uh, are you okay?

132
00:14:40.399 --> 00:14:43.231
- If I could...
- Don't touch me.


133
00:14:43.331 --> 00:14:45.571
- Don't!
- I'm sorry.


134
00:14:45.671 --> 00:14:48.324
You know, stop... don't apologize.
Why are you apologizing?


135
00:14:48.424 --> 00:14:52.501
I won't apologize again. All right.
I just though we might've had a...


136
00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:55.983
connection last night.

137
00:14:56.899 --> 00:15:01.237
- What did you do?
- Okay, that's lame. I'm sorry.


138
00:15:01.837 --> 00:15:03.629
Oh.

139
00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:07.588
Can I have my T-shirt back?

140
00:15:09.111 --> 00:15:11.336
No, keep it.

141
00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:14.840
A connection. You connected with pussy.

142
00:15:18.287 --> 00:15:20.712
What has happened to you?

143
00:15:35.204 --> 00:15:38.307
Wait! I just want to talk
to you, just for a second.


144
00:15:38.407 --> 00:15:41.666
It's about the complex's party policy.

145
00:15:42.795 --> 00:15:45.064
You're just going to ignore me?

146
00:15:45.464 --> 00:15:47.233
This is super childish.

147
00:15:47.383 --> 00:15:51.676
This is not the way for adults
or neighbors to behave.


148
00:15:52.688 --> 00:15:55.214
I know you're in there.

149
00:17:13.135 --> 00:17:15.371
Where are you?

150
00:17:15.471 --> 00:17:18.307
Well, you know where you're
gonna be in 1.5 hours?


151
00:17:18.407 --> 00:17:21.466
You're gonna be here in my pussy.

152
00:17:32.988 --> 00:17:34.857
Who was that on the phone?

153
00:17:34.957 --> 00:17:38.349
Steven, of course.
It's Steven kind of week.


154
00:17:44.533 --> 00:17:46.357
What?

155
00:17:46.869 --> 00:17:50.929
- Don't you remember?
- Fashion waits for no one.


156
00:17:54.009 --> 00:17:56.668
Why didn't you tell me
we're having a party?


157
00:17:57.212 --> 00:17:59.248
Oh, honey.

158
00:17:59.348 --> 00:18:03.994
Did you have fun, right? You know,
I think that guy Rob, is totally into you.


159
00:18:04.094 --> 00:18:07.057
- I think it was perfect.
- Until the cops showed up.


160
00:18:08.457 --> 00:18:10.293
Whatever.

161
00:18:10.793 --> 00:18:15.464
- You know, we both live here.
- Oh, my God, not you too.


162
00:18:15.564 --> 00:18:18.334
I already had to dodge
that nosy old Cathy.


163
00:18:18.434 --> 00:18:21.470
"I just want to talk about
the complex's party policy."


164
00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:24.917
It's not complicated.
I had a party and you weren't invited.


165
00:18:25.374 --> 00:18:28.944
Noise complaints? 
She's a ruiner of fun.

166
00:18:29.044 --> 00:18:32.303
She's not that bad.
She's actually kind of nice.


167
00:18:35.083 --> 00:18:38.296
She's like talking to a basket of rolls.

168
00:18:38.396 --> 00:18:41.110
And she doesn't get a say
about what goes on in my house.


169
00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:44.026
Neither do you until
you, like, get a job.

170
00:18:44.126 --> 00:18:45.828
- I'm trying.
- No, you're not.


171
00:18:45.928 --> 00:18:48.836
You're lying around
in your fat and your filth.


172
00:18:48.936 --> 00:18:52.401
- Don't be like...
- Constructive, motivational?


173
00:18:52.501 --> 00:18:56.805
- Destructive and cruel, you know, like...
- I know. You won't let me forget it.


174
00:18:56.905 --> 00:18:58.907
But you've been here
for nine months already.


175
00:18:59.007 --> 00:19:02.411
- So have you.
- Not paying rent, I'd like to add.


176
00:19:02.511 --> 00:19:05.981
- Oh, you're such a good friend.
- Don't kiss my ass, bitch.


177
00:19:06.081 --> 00:19:11.253
It was sarcasm.
Anyway, you're suppose to be helping me.


178
00:19:11.353 --> 00:19:13.456
Oh, here we go. 
Blah, blah, blah.

179
00:19:13.556 --> 00:19:16.192
It's so hard, blah, blah.

180
00:19:16.292 --> 00:19:19.828
This town is wide open, so stop your whining,
strap on a six-shooter,


181
00:19:19.928 --> 00:19:22.765
- and get to fucking work.
- It's easy for you to say.


182
00:19:22.865 --> 00:19:25.417
Yeah, and easy to do,

183
00:19:25.517 --> 00:19:28.443
but you have to leave the fucking house.

184
00:19:29.805 --> 00:19:32.674
Jill, I am your friend. I...

185
00:19:32.774 --> 00:19:37.001
I'm harsh with you because I respect you
enough to not bullshit the true.


186
00:19:39.448 --> 00:19:41.873
I'm having a hard time.

187
00:19:42.351 --> 00:19:45.087
I don't wanna talk about this anymore.

188
00:19:45.187 --> 00:19:48.190
This weekend... this weekend we'll sit down
and we'll figure everything out.


189
00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:51.793
Make a total plan for your life,
even give a bitch a makeover.


190
00:19:51.893 --> 00:19:56.565
- It's always this weekend.
- No more, not tonight, Jill.


191
00:19:56.665 --> 00:20:00.458
I just want to watch some TV,
finish my dinner, and wait for Steven.


192
00:20:08.277 --> 00:20:11.302
Trying to get my own hard time.

193
00:20:13.348 --> 00:20:14.941
Want some?

194
00:20:17.252 --> 00:20:21.479
You're a b... you're a bitch.

195
00:20:22.157 --> 00:20:25.061
- You know that?
- I know.


196
00:20:25.461 --> 00:20:27.285
Right.

197
00:21:12.107 --> 00:21:14.356
I don't know, I...

198
00:21:14.456 --> 00:21:17.780
I just... I can do better. You know.

199
00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:20.849
Is that a question?

200
00:21:20.949 --> 00:21:27.326
Right, like I know I'm good,
but what if I felt good too?


201
00:21:27.426 --> 00:21:31.349
I understand. Is that water?

202
00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:39.301
We're okay, just... I don't know.
You know what I'm saying?


203
00:21:39.401 --> 00:21:41.459
I don't.

204
00:21:42.471 --> 00:21:45.740
Do you know what a suppository is?

205
00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:49.077
- What's that?
- Depository, like a bank?


206
00:21:49.177 --> 00:21:52.881
Suppository.
This gets inserted into your anus.


207
00:21:52.981 --> 00:21:57.975
Oh, you're looking at me.
On camera, I do that?


208
00:22:20.075 --> 00:22:21.677
This is a test.

209
00:22:21.777 --> 00:22:26.014
This station is conducting a test
of the Emergency Broadcast System.


210
00:22:26.114 --> 00:22:28.439
This is only a test.

211
00:23:53.635 --> 00:23:56.972
Okay, guys, at the premier
of his new movie,


212
00:23:57.072 --> 00:24:01.355
a fan thrust a baby
into Zac Effron's face.


213
00:24:01.455 --> 00:24:03.071
Check it out.

214
00:24:03.171 --> 00:24:04.813
- That's crazy.
- Aren't they handsome?


215
00:24:04.913 --> 00:24:06.214
Well, it's got a big head.

216
00:24:06.314 --> 00:24:09.017
Wait, wait, no.
I think she wants him to...


217
00:27:44.332 --> 00:27:46.591
See you, babe.

218
00:28:21.303 --> 00:28:23.127
Hi.

219
00:28:23.855 --> 00:28:25.957
Why are you up so late?

220
00:28:26.057 --> 00:28:28.182
Mom, it's afternoon.

221
00:28:28.776 --> 00:28:30.601
Oh.

222
00:28:37.619 --> 00:28:41.357
I just had the most horrible dream
about you, darling.


223
00:28:42.457 --> 00:28:45.807
It's a sign.
I think you need to come home.


224
00:28:47.119 --> 00:28:48.549
Fine.

225
00:28:48.649 --> 00:28:51.055
You look washed out.

226
00:28:51.566 --> 00:28:54.192
You shouldn't wear that color.

227
00:28:57.238 --> 00:28:59.774
Oh, my God, oh, my God.
Someone's in the house!


228
00:28:59.874 --> 00:29:02.244
Listen! Listen!

229
00:29:02.344 --> 00:29:04.580
They're coming! 
They're coming!

230
00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:09.540
Mommy loves you so much. So much.

231
00:29:14.889 --> 00:29:16.614
Mom.

232
00:29:19.995 --> 00:29:22.853
It's Daddy. Daddy's home.

233
00:29:23.031 --> 00:29:27.558
- I see him.
- You wanna... you wanna come say hello?


234
00:29:30.538 --> 00:29:34.368
Daddy doesn't... he doesn't
wanna be on camera. He's shy.


235
00:29:34.868 --> 00:29:38.836
But he's home! Daddy's home! Yay!

236
00:29:41.583 --> 00:29:46.254
Why... why are you home?

237
00:29:46.354 --> 00:29:49.791
What... why are you home?
I didn't call you.


238
00:29:49.891 --> 00:29:54.396
What... I don't... wait... what's wrong?

239
00:29:54.496 --> 00:29:58.556
Stop messing with my hair, I fixed it!

240
00:29:59.734 --> 00:30:02.569
Oh, I did call you.

241
00:30:02.669 --> 00:30:07.509
You need... you need to convince
our daughter to come home.


242
00:30:07.609 --> 00:30:10.345
Jackson, it's vital.

243
00:30:10.445 --> 00:30:12.647
It's vital.

244
00:30:12.747 --> 00:30:15.984
She's in trouble. No.

245
00:30:16.484 --> 00:30:18.615
I don't wanna go to bed now.
I don't wanna go to bed.


246
00:30:18.715 --> 00:30:22.313
I don't wanna go
to bed. No, stop it.

247
00:30:23.658 --> 00:30:25.416
No!

248
00:30:49.083 --> 00:30:53.707
I know you hate it when I apologize.
So I present you with this.


249
00:30:54.322 --> 00:30:57.082
I regret the collateral damage.

250
00:30:58.693 --> 00:31:01.285
Shit, you're mad.

251
00:31:11.706 --> 00:31:14.565
I'm making lunch, do you want some?

252
00:31:19.681 --> 00:31:21.738
This is whoa.

253
00:31:23.885 --> 00:31:26.844
Mm-hm. This is whoa.

254
00:31:28.523 --> 00:31:32.716
You're not gonna have any?
That's all you're having?


255
00:31:33.016 --> 00:31:36.587
Um, no, I don't
like to cook and eat.

256
00:31:37.865 --> 00:31:41.762
Well, let's go out! Have somebody else cook,
this town is great for food.


257
00:31:43.438 --> 00:31:47.542
So those kids on your Facebook page,
they're not yours.


258
00:31:47.642 --> 00:31:49.477
Fuck no.

259
00:31:49.577 --> 00:31:51.879
I mean, I didn't mean it that way.
I meant it like...


260
00:31:51.979 --> 00:31:54.515
It's just complicated, all right?

261
00:31:54.615 --> 00:31:58.153
I work for the CFSD.
I worked for the CFSD.


262
00:31:58.253 --> 00:32:00.455
I'm confused.

263
00:32:00.555 --> 00:32:03.464
California Children
and Family Service Division.


264
00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:10.398
Well, just so you know you can see
everything on your Facebook page. So...


265
00:32:10.498 --> 00:32:13.501
- I'm the worst at social media.
- Yeah.


266
00:32:13.601 --> 00:32:16.037
Someone told me that I actually have
to do something with that stuff.


267
00:32:16.137 --> 00:32:18.366
The privacy settings?

268
00:32:19.107 --> 00:32:23.434
Is that how we know each other?
From Facebook? Friend of a friend?


269
00:32:25.914 --> 00:32:28.883
Is it bad that I knew nothing
about that at all?


270
00:32:28.983 --> 00:32:32.087
Mm, no. I just mean
you have to be careful.


271
00:32:32.187 --> 00:32:34.044
About?

272
00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:41.370
Being too open.

273
00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:43.765
Really? I always thought
that was a good thing.


274
00:32:43.865 --> 00:32:45.923
I don't know.

275
00:32:47.402 --> 00:32:49.660
Did I say something wrong?

276
00:32:51.439 --> 00:32:53.909
What are you talking about?

277
00:32:54.409 --> 00:32:56.266
Shit.

278
00:32:57.745 --> 00:32:59.648
I said too much, yeah?

279
00:33:00.248 --> 00:33:02.817
I'm such a douchebag.

280
00:33:02.917 --> 00:33:04.319
All right, I feel like a douche.

281
00:33:04.419 --> 00:33:06.888
- No.
- My lunch is about over, so.


282
00:33:06.988 --> 00:33:10.225
Did you wanna take some...
some food home, at least?


283
00:33:10.325 --> 00:33:12.850
- I'd love that.
- Okay.


284
00:33:41.222 --> 00:33:43.558
You know I like you, right?

285
00:33:43.658 --> 00:33:47.051
- I mean not like in a hook up kind of way.
- I like you.


286
00:34:00.274 --> 00:34:02.566
That was nice, right?

287
00:34:05.446 --> 00:34:07.537
I don't know.

288
00:34:11.819 --> 00:34:13.922
Thanks for the meal.

289
00:34:14.322 --> 00:34:16.534
We're gonna go out, right?

290
00:34:17.392 --> 00:34:19.283
Okay.

291
00:34:20.161 --> 00:34:23.844
All right, back to the real world.
Whatever that means.


292
00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:28.559
Man, that's corny. Uh, yeah.

293
00:34:31.272 --> 00:34:33.364
I'm lame.

294
00:34:36.010 --> 00:34:38.301
I warned you about that.

295
00:34:51.959 --> 00:34:54.962
I'm just... gonna clean up.

296
00:34:55.062 --> 00:34:57.187
Go do that.

297
00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:24.025
Fuck!

298
00:35:24.425 --> 00:35:26.717
Creepy bitch.

299
00:35:29.530 --> 00:35:31.456
What?

300
00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:34.792
Oh.

301
00:35:35.503 --> 00:35:37.761
You're mad.

302
00:35:38.856 --> 00:35:40.792
Don't be mad.

303
00:35:41.342 --> 00:35:44.135
There's nothing wrong with a little...

304
00:35:47.548 --> 00:35:49.684
I'm starving.

305
00:35:49.784 --> 00:35:51.875
You promised.

306
00:35:52.420 --> 00:35:56.688
You were never fuck him or his pretty dick.
I couldn't let that go to waste.


307
00:35:56.788 --> 00:35:59.116
But you promised.

308
00:36:00.261 --> 00:36:03.654
Oh, my fucking God, are these short ribs?

309
00:36:10.505 --> 00:36:14.308
- You promised.
- Oh, honey, look.


310
00:36:14.408 --> 00:36:19.637
I'm sorry, I don't know what came over me.
I can't control myself.


311
00:36:21.015 --> 00:36:26.321
I'm exhausted. It's probably why
I'm being such a crazy mega bitch.


312
00:36:26.421 --> 00:36:30.954
I'm sorry for it all. Tomorrow,
look, tomorrow I promise...


313
00:36:31.854 --> 00:36:34.762
we'll sit down and talk everything out.

314
00:36:34.862 --> 00:36:37.682
- Everything?
- Everything.


315
00:36:37.782 --> 00:36:42.859
We'll have a nice meal and I'll get
a good bottle of wine. And you can cook.


316
00:36:44.105 --> 00:36:47.342
- Tomorrow.
- Prom, tomorrow.


317
00:36:47.442 --> 00:36:50.300
I'm gonna crash. Goodnight.

318
00:38:46.961 --> 00:38:50.631
Dear Neighbor, I was so happy
when you moved in.


319
00:38:50.731 --> 00:38:55.870
I imagined shared morning coffees
and borrowing sugar.


320
00:38:55.970 --> 00:38:59.274
I at least hoped,
that if we couldn't be friends,


321
00:38:59.374 --> 00:39:03.711
we could be courteous neighbors,
but that has all changed.


322
00:39:03.811 --> 00:39:09.467
You have changed, and it concerns me,
and not just because I live next door.


323
00:39:09.567 --> 00:39:12.253
The party was an obvious cry for help.

324
00:39:12.353 --> 00:39:15.756
I mean, no offense,
but choose better friends.


325
00:39:15.856 --> 00:39:17.792
I don't want to have to call someone.

326
00:39:17.892 --> 00:39:20.862
That's not the kind of friend
and neighbor I would want,


327
00:39:20.962 --> 00:39:23.820
so that's not the
kind I'm going to be.

328
00:39:24.465 --> 00:39:26.226
I mean...

329
00:39:26.326 --> 00:39:29.623
I know, you're having a hard time.

330
00:39:30.104 --> 00:39:33.808
I just wanted to send a little gift and
let you know we're thinking about you.


331
00:39:33.908 --> 00:39:38.179
If you ever want to talk,
I am totally here for you.


332
00:39:38.279 --> 00:39:40.414
Push the button.

333
00:39:40.514 --> 00:39:42.539
Call me.

334
00:39:43.050 --> 00:39:45.475
It's a cinch.

335
00:40:16.851 --> 00:40:19.843
What up, Jilly Jill?

336
00:40:25.126 --> 00:40:27.875
Damn.

337
00:40:28.996 --> 00:40:30.698
Romantic.

338
00:40:30.798 --> 00:40:33.189
Where have you been?

339
00:40:37.188 --> 00:40:39.379
What the duck?

340
00:40:47.576 --> 00:40:51.220
Oh, God. That tastes like ass.

341
00:40:55.289 --> 00:40:58.226
It's not fair what you're doing to me.

342
00:40:58.826 --> 00:41:01.185
We were gonna talk.

343
00:41:03.330 --> 00:41:05.166
I need to talk.

344
00:41:05.266 --> 00:41:07.969
I've been so patient.

345
00:41:08.869 --> 00:41:10.605
Patient?

346
00:41:10.705 --> 00:41:14.764
Don't you go talking to me
ever again about patience.


347
00:41:20.147 --> 00:41:25.108
Patience is one of the seven
deadly sins of not having a fucking life.


348
00:41:34.962 --> 00:41:37.787
You'll never beat me.

349
00:43:28.609 --> 00:43:30.400
Jill?

350
00:43:34.615 --> 00:43:36.473
Jill.

351
00:43:54.501 --> 00:43:56.593
The fuck?

352
00:44:02.376 --> 00:44:04.768
What the fuck, Jill?

353
00:44:07.798 --> 00:44:11.269
- What the fuck?
- We need to talk.


354
00:44:12.319 --> 00:44:14.511
Told you.

355
00:44:47.437 --> 00:44:50.197
You're not gonna get away
with this, you know.


356
00:44:57.364 --> 00:44:59.656
Psycho bitch.

357
00:45:10.044 --> 00:45:12.135
Oh!

358
00:45:18.219 --> 00:45:20.221
Let's talk.

359
00:45:20.621 --> 00:45:23.280
Okay, what do you want to talk about?

360
00:45:24.958 --> 00:45:27.636
Don't tempt me.

361
00:45:30.798 --> 00:45:35.596
- We'll figure it all out.
- Don't patronize me, serio.


362
00:45:36.103 --> 00:45:38.394
Don't you dare.

363
00:45:39.774 --> 00:45:41.666
Oh.

364
00:46:05.332 --> 00:46:07.401
Please stop.

365
00:46:07.501 --> 00:46:09.759
I will help you.

366
00:46:21.982 --> 00:46:24.919
Mm, still moist.

367
00:46:25.019 --> 00:46:27.310
That's just cruel.

368
00:46:37.397 --> 00:46:39.189
Hmm.

369
00:46:44.805 --> 00:46:46.663
Oh.

370
00:46:49.610 --> 00:46:51.435
Oh.

371
00:46:52.246 --> 00:46:54.471
La la-la la.

372
00:46:58.752 --> 00:47:00.854
Such a perfect wedding.

373
00:47:00.954 --> 00:47:03.691
You've really crossed the line.

374
00:47:06.193 --> 00:47:09.556
- What happened?
- Don't go any farther.


375
00:47:29.249 --> 00:47:31.542
You don't want any?

376
00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:35.915
It's okay, it's more for me.

377
00:47:37.824 --> 00:47:40.550
God, it's so good.

378
00:47:42.162 --> 00:47:46.066
You do everything good.
How could you fuck up your marriage?


379
00:47:46.366 --> 00:47:48.702
I never wanted to believe all
that stuff Trevor said about you.


380
00:47:48.802 --> 00:47:52.531
- Don't you say his name!
- The frigidity...


381
00:47:52.631 --> 00:47:54.908
the slovenliness, the disorder.

382
00:47:55.008 --> 00:47:57.500
That's not you.

383
00:47:58.645 --> 00:48:01.605
It's not the Jennifer I know.

384
00:48:03.283 --> 00:48:05.675
Why are you doing this?

385
00:48:07.687 --> 00:48:10.891
- You know why.
- I will help you.


386
00:48:10.991 --> 00:48:13.449
Mm-mm, it's too late.

387
00:48:15.062 --> 00:48:18.298
Trevor always said you were selfish and
then now I see that all he said was true.


388
00:48:18.398 --> 00:48:21.502
- He broke me.
- You seem fine to me.


389
00:48:21.602 --> 00:48:24.438
Nothing I ever did was right.

390
00:48:24.538 --> 00:48:27.741
- Crawl to me, bitch.
- Should got knee pads.


391
00:48:27.841 --> 00:48:31.434
I did, but it wasn't enough.

392
00:48:34.081 --> 00:48:36.684
Try harder. Try harder.

393
00:48:36.784 --> 00:48:38.719
Try harder. Try harder.

394
00:48:38.819 --> 00:48:41.355
My skirts were too long.

395
00:48:41.855 --> 00:48:45.148
My necklines were too high. What?

396
00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:48.262
Try harder.

397
00:48:48.362 --> 00:48:52.299
- The underwear.
- Come on, come on, you wouldn't swallow.


398
00:48:52.399 --> 00:48:57.060
Why won't you say that?
You wouldn't even go near it.


399
00:48:58.472 --> 00:49:00.864
You should see you now.

400
00:49:05.946 --> 00:49:08.282
He was rough.

401
00:49:08.382 --> 00:49:12.409
He said I was flabby, 
I disgusted him.

402
00:49:14.688 --> 00:49:17.714
Maybe... maybe you could get him back.

403
00:49:21.561 --> 00:49:23.564
He was cruel.

404
00:49:23.664 --> 00:49:28.191
Oh, he was constructive and motivational.

405
00:49:30.237 --> 00:49:31.772
I mean, you should take his advice.

406
00:49:31.872 --> 00:49:34.708
Seriously, reinvent yourself,
become the cu...


407
00:49:34.808 --> 00:49:37.978
slutty cum-guzzler
Trevor always wanted you to be.


408
00:49:38.078 --> 00:49:42.633
It can't be that bad, you just got to be
particular about what you feed him, right?


409
00:49:42.733 --> 00:49:46.526
Yeah, you could do your research.
You're good at that, remember?


410
00:49:52.559 --> 00:49:54.817
Really good.

411
00:50:02.936 --> 00:50:06.359
Seriously, you could save
your marriage, Jennifer.


412
00:50:08.909 --> 00:50:11.534
I don't want him back.

413
00:50:16.917 --> 00:50:19.475
So you don't want a piece of cake?

414
00:50:22.756 --> 00:50:25.614
I want you to let me go.

415
00:50:29.196 --> 00:50:34.091
Well, now we know what it's like to want
something from someone and not get it.


416
00:50:40.474 --> 00:50:42.832
Frothy and nasty.

417
00:51:21.142 --> 00:51:24.218
Help! Help me!

418
00:51:24.318 --> 00:51:26.968
Somebody help! Help!

419
00:51:27.068 --> 00:51:29.808
Help me! Help me!

420
00:51:31.357 --> 00:51:33.494
Stop it. Stop your screeching.

421
00:51:33.594 --> 00:51:38.966
I've heard it every night for months
and so has everyone else.


422
00:51:39.716 --> 00:51:42.141
Oh, wow. That was easy.

423
00:51:42.536 --> 00:51:44.910
Or were you faking it?

424
00:51:47.974 --> 00:51:51.478
You don't have to convince me
of anything, honey.


425
00:51:51.578 --> 00:51:54.047
Okay, where were we? Let's see.

426
00:51:54.147 --> 00:51:58.025
Problem areas, problem areas.

427
00:52:01.454 --> 00:52:04.491
Arms up, please.

428
00:52:05.191 --> 00:52:07.550
Up! Please.

429
00:52:23.076 --> 00:52:26.480
Just remember, everyone can hear you.

430
00:52:26.580 --> 00:52:30.995
And by the way... no one cares.

431
00:52:51.838 --> 00:52:54.163
Is anybody in here?

432
00:52:55.742 --> 00:52:58.034
Hello, it's Rob.

433
00:53:03.316 --> 00:53:05.668
Look, if you're in there...

434
00:53:08.088 --> 00:53:11.458
I'm just trying to figure out
what went wrong, that's all.


435
00:53:11.958 --> 00:53:14.306
I've been calling...

436
00:53:14.406 --> 00:53:16.163
a lot.

437
00:53:16.263 --> 00:53:20.067
And I have your Tupperware, so...

438
00:53:25.856 --> 00:53:28.563
Oh, shit. I'm so sorry.

439
00:53:29.913 --> 00:53:31.178
I'm so sorry.

440
00:53:31.278 --> 00:53:34.514
It's okay, it's not...
it's not your fault.


441
00:53:34.614 --> 00:53:37.484
Have you see her at all?

442
00:53:37.584 --> 00:53:39.019
- No.
- No?


443
00:53:39.119 --> 00:53:42.123
No, I think she's at work.

444
00:53:43.023 --> 00:53:44.825
Oh.

445
00:53:45.725 --> 00:53:47.561
- Oh.
- Did you hear that?


446
00:53:47.661 --> 00:53:49.457
Fucking cinch.

447
00:53:56.803 --> 00:53:58.672
What?

448
00:53:58.772 --> 00:54:03.100
- What's so funny.
- Nothing. Nothing.


449
00:54:16.189 --> 00:54:18.391
- What? Huh?
- It's just...


450
00:54:18.491 --> 00:54:20.861
- What is it you're saying?
- Nothing.


451
00:54:20.961 --> 00:54:23.320
Are you saying I'm...

452
00:54:25.164 --> 00:54:29.536
Are you saying I'm fat?
I'm a fat pig? Huh?


453
00:54:29.636 --> 00:54:31.257
Like...

454
00:54:31.357 --> 00:54:35.042
I just can't control myself?
Is that what you're saying?


455
00:54:35.742 --> 00:54:37.500
I'm happy.

456
00:54:39.079 --> 00:54:41.689
Happy? Show me happy. Show me.

457
00:55:07.174 --> 00:55:11.736
Stop crying, stop it, stop.
It's not that bad. It's not.


458
00:55:11.836 --> 00:55:15.669
Jennifer st... Oh, my God, 
Jennifer, stop.

459
00:55:15.769 --> 00:55:20.036
Not tonight. Would you please?
I just wanna watch TV.


460
00:55:20.136 --> 00:55:23.078
Maybe eat my dinner, and wait for Steven.

461
00:55:27.761 --> 00:55:29.485
Here.

462
00:55:35.435 --> 00:55:37.493
Stop crying.

463
00:55:53.587 --> 00:55:56.212
- Another one?
- Yes.


464
00:56:15.408 --> 00:56:18.200
- Another?
- Yes.


465
00:56:42.168 --> 00:56:44.060
Really?

466
00:56:56.616 --> 00:57:00.787
- Really that is so fucking rude.
- What?


467
00:57:00.887 --> 00:57:04.057
I'm sharing with you.
You're not gonna share with me? Huh?


468
00:57:04.157 --> 00:57:06.887
That's the way we do it, right?
Right? Isn't that how we do it?


469
00:57:06.987 --> 00:57:11.197
- I don't understand.
- What? You don't? I don't understand?


470
00:57:13.216 --> 00:57:15.118
Of course you don't fucking understand!

471
00:57:15.218 --> 00:57:19.389
Because you're too fucking selfish!
You're too selfish, Jennifer.


472
00:57:19.489 --> 00:57:23.176
You want them all,
you can fucking have them all!


473
00:57:23.276 --> 00:57:27.517
Fucking have them! We can't let
any of them go to waste, okay?


474
00:57:27.617 --> 00:57:32.619
None of 'em go to waste.
Eat 'em fucking all right now.


475
00:57:32.719 --> 00:57:34.951
Eat 'em, please.

476
00:57:49.936 --> 00:57:52.139
Going to rehab.

477
00:57:52.539 --> 00:57:55.331
- It's the middle of the night, mother.
- Oh.


478
00:58:02.048 --> 00:58:04.996
I had another dream about you.

479
00:58:05.496 --> 00:58:09.356
And... you...

480
00:58:09.556 --> 00:58:11.645
were...

481
00:58:12.735 --> 00:58:14.559
perfect!

482
00:58:16.663 --> 00:58:21.729
I know you will do whatever it takes

483
00:58:21.829 --> 00:58:25.196
to get your life back on track.

484
00:58:28.942 --> 00:58:32.629
Mommy will call you from rehab.

485
00:58:33.279 --> 00:58:35.317
Okay.

486
00:59:04.677 --> 00:59:08.245
Harder. Work harder!

487
00:59:08.345 --> 00:59:11.640
Work harder!

488
00:59:23.396 --> 00:59:25.331
I'm so tired.

489
00:59:25.431 --> 00:59:27.901
I said dance.

490
00:59:28.001 --> 00:59:29.792
Dance.

491
00:59:35.641 --> 00:59:37.877
Make it sexy.

492
00:59:37.977 --> 00:59:41.648
Rob told me you are an excellent dancer.

493
00:59:41.748 --> 00:59:45.252
So show me how you
make the boys go wild.

494
00:59:45.852 --> 00:59:47.610
Dance.

495
01:00:09.528 --> 01:00:13.735
Jill? Open up the door. 
It's... it's Rob.

496
01:00:15.114 --> 01:00:18.333
Open up the door! Godda...

497
01:00:22.755 --> 01:00:24.557
What?

498
01:00:24.657 --> 01:00:28.294
- Are you okay?
- I'm fantastic, okay?


499
01:00:28.394 --> 01:00:30.886
You... you look...

500
01:00:31.197 --> 01:00:35.268
I've been calling you. Why haven't you
answered? I've been worried about you.


501
01:00:35.368 --> 01:00:38.338
- Would you get your hand off the chain?
- Let me help you. Let me help...


502
01:00:38.438 --> 01:00:42.664
- Take your hand off the chain.
- I understand. What the fuck?


503
01:01:45.371 --> 01:01:47.162
Rob?

504
01:02:37.490 --> 01:02:39.826
We are back.

505
01:02:39.926 --> 01:02:44.330
It is the final dessert round, and one
of these chefs will be preparing...


506
01:02:44.430 --> 01:02:45.999
their last meal.

507
01:02:46.099 --> 01:02:48.768
Chef Amy, what are you preparing for us?

508
01:02:48.868 --> 01:02:52.872
Well, I have just put some delicate
almond lady cakes in the oven.


509
01:02:52.972 --> 01:02:56.242
And I'm going to dress them
with praline lace sponge sugar


510
01:02:56.342 --> 01:02:58.044
and a bit of fresh whipped cream.

511
01:02:58.144 --> 01:03:00.046
That sounds...

512
01:03:00.146 --> 01:03:02.749
There's been some kind of explosion.
There's so much smoke.


513
01:03:02.849 --> 01:03:07.386
I can't locate chef Amy.
She might be... she might be...


514
01:03:07.486 --> 01:03:08.721
I dominate.

515
01:03:08.821 --> 01:03:11.090
Was that your strategy
all along, Chef Adam,


516
01:03:11.190 --> 01:03:14.194
to kill your opponent
before her desert presentation?


517
01:03:14.294 --> 01:03:17.705
Are you that worried about
Chef Amy's cooking skills?


518
01:04:39.712 --> 01:04:42.938
We knew this challenge
would not go unanswered.


519
01:04:44.917 --> 01:04:47.840
How is she going to compete
with the simplicity and elegance


520
01:04:47.940 --> 01:04:50.073
of her competitor's presentation?

521
01:05:12.712 --> 01:05:15.214
Ooh, love the undergarment.

522
01:05:15.314 --> 01:05:18.150
I think those are
from the ecstasy collection.


523
01:05:20.887 --> 01:05:23.222
Come on. Fuck me.

524
01:05:23.322 --> 01:05:25.748
Well, that's an approach.

525
01:05:31.464 --> 01:05:35.735
I thought with the panties,
it would be classier.


526
01:05:35.835 --> 01:05:38.694
Rude and over the top!

527
01:05:59.992 --> 01:06:02.551
Looks like she's going back in the box.

528
01:06:04.196 --> 01:06:07.697
Ooh, I am liking this.

529
01:06:12.972 --> 01:06:15.597
This is showmanship.

530
01:06:17.877 --> 01:06:20.803
The audience is going wild.

531
01:06:25.117 --> 01:06:27.420
What? Did she study gymnastics?

532
01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:31.791
She majored in fashion
merchandise at Parsons.


533
01:06:31.891 --> 01:06:35.150
I'll give her points for creativity.

534
01:06:35.761 --> 01:06:38.754
Who knew the body could bend like that?

535
01:06:41.033 --> 01:06:45.727
A for effort, but overall
another disappointment.


536
01:06:48.541 --> 01:06:51.845
- I wonder what she's getting.
- Does she have time for an extra ingredient?


537
01:06:51.945 --> 01:06:56.238
You know, I don't know, but she needs
to pull this off if she wants to stay alive.


538
01:07:02.221 --> 01:07:05.391
- Are those kumquats?
- Yes, they are.


539
01:07:05.491 --> 01:07:06.893
You eat those whole, is that right?

540
01:07:06.993 --> 01:07:11.297
Yes. The flesh, it's quite sour,
but the skin is sweet.


541
01:07:11.397 --> 01:07:13.133
When eaten together

542
01:07:13.233 --> 01:07:18.460
they produce an unusual,
but refreshing flavor.


543
01:07:18.560 --> 01:07:20.328
Fascinating.

544
01:07:21.507 --> 01:07:23.076
Oh, that is just sad.

545
01:07:23.176 --> 01:07:26.045
Theatrics didn't serve you well
the last time.


546
01:07:26.145 --> 01:07:29.738
- Who is throwing fruit?
- Her muscle control is impressive.


547
01:07:31.467 --> 01:07:33.409
Game on.

548
01:07:34.253 --> 01:07:36.956
This is competition, ladies and gentleman.

549
01:07:37.056 --> 01:07:39.314
What a battle!

550
01:07:41.560 --> 01:07:44.653
Looks like she's going back
to the Mystery Box.


551
01:07:47.432 --> 01:07:51.637
- Handsome.
- This could be a game changer.


552
01:07:51.737 --> 01:07:53.562
Interesting!

553
01:08:09.355 --> 01:08:12.124
I am not prepared to evaluate this.

554
01:08:12.224 --> 01:08:15.728
You look like shit,
she looks like shit, right?


555
01:08:15.828 --> 01:08:18.577
This is not in my contract.

556
01:08:22.234 --> 01:08:23.302
Crawl bitch!

557
01:08:23.402 --> 01:08:27.896
- Are we cutting to commercial?
- Fucking crawl bitch! Come on.


558
01:08:29.775 --> 01:08:31.811
We're going to have to consult the rules.

559
01:08:31.911 --> 01:08:34.540
Come on, come to papa.

560
01:08:39.819 --> 01:08:41.710
Um...

561
01:08:44.590 --> 01:08:45.992
Bye, Rob.

562
01:08:46.092 --> 01:08:49.610
I hate this dress!

563
01:09:10.015 --> 01:09:12.207
Where'd you go?

564
01:09:12.751 --> 01:09:14.645
Baby.

565
01:09:16.143 --> 01:09:18.091
Baby.

566
01:09:20.493 --> 01:09:23.599
Stop crying.

567
01:09:31.137 --> 01:09:32.661
Sorry.

568
01:10:34.867 --> 01:10:39.572
Fucking filthy!
You're fucking filthy! You're so...


569
01:11:05.297 --> 01:11:09.869
Fucking fuck! You little fucking slut!

570
01:11:10.269 --> 01:11:15.540
You can't even stay
out of my fucking dream.


571
01:11:33.392 --> 01:11:36.451
No! No, Jenny, no!

572
01:11:37.696 --> 01:11:39.587
Jenny?

573
01:11:41.300 --> 01:11:43.124
Jenny.

574
01:11:58.951 --> 01:12:00.219
Jenny!

575
01:12:00.319 --> 01:12:03.088
Hey, did you see Jenny?
She lives right up there.


576
01:12:03.188 --> 01:12:07.654
She's got red hair. 
She's... in trouble.

577
01:12:18.871 --> 01:12:21.863
Why won't anybody help me?

578
01:12:39.525 --> 01:12:41.360
Jennifer!

579
01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:45.698
What? What? You okay? 
What happened?

580
01:12:45.798 --> 01:12:49.268
You are not fit for company.
What are you doing out here?


581
01:12:49.368 --> 01:12:51.403
- No, no, no.
- Miss. Miss.


582
01:12:51.503 --> 01:12:54.740
Oh, hi. What? Officers,
thank you so much for being here.


583
01:12:54.840 --> 01:12:57.777
This is my roommate.
She is having a really bad sleep disorder.


584
01:12:57.877 --> 01:13:01.113
It's been going on for months.
And honestly, she's on a cleanse as well.


585
01:13:01.213 --> 01:13:04.283
And that's really messing up
her sleep cycle.


586
01:13:04.383 --> 01:13:06.385
- Just settle down here a minute.
- It's crazy.


587
01:13:06.485 --> 01:13:09.107
Why don't you sit back down there...

588
01:13:09.607 --> 01:13:11.490
- ...catch your breath.
- Good idea.


589
01:13:11.590 --> 01:13:13.158
Miss.

590
01:13:13.258 --> 01:13:14.860
What?

591
01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:18.520
Have a seat. Calm down, please.

592
01:13:21.900 --> 01:13:24.158
Look at me.

593
01:13:24.737 --> 01:13:28.952
- Tell me what's wrong.
- I told you, it's a nasty...


594
01:13:29.052 --> 01:13:31.991
master cleanse, and the sleep deprivation.

595
01:13:33.145 --> 01:13:36.582
I mean, you know how it is
trying to lose a few pounds, right?


596
01:13:36.682 --> 01:13:41.020
Not that I know, I mean... that you know,
'cause you're really fit, in good shape.


597
01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:46.659
And your costume fits... I mean,
outfit... or uniform, fits really good...


598
01:13:46.759 --> 01:13:49.562
Okay, okay, a cleanse, and sleep problems.

599
01:13:49.662 --> 01:13:53.087
But that doesn't explain...

600
01:13:53.465 --> 01:13:57.236
One can't just go out in public
half dressed looking like that.


601
01:13:57.336 --> 01:13:59.905
Yes, that's what I'm telling her,
all that time, right?


602
01:14:00.005 --> 01:14:01.373
But she wears... she hardly wears...

603
01:14:01.473 --> 01:14:04.910
She wears more...
less than this most of the time.


604
01:14:05.010 --> 01:14:08.213
I guess you'd only get away
with that if you're sexy, right?


605
01:14:08.313 --> 01:14:11.283
Yeah, sex appeal is not the issue here.

606
01:14:11.383 --> 01:14:15.421
Right. 'Cause you're not the...
the fashion police.


607
01:14:15.521 --> 01:14:17.533
Obviously!

608
01:14:19.858 --> 01:14:21.393
We're here to help you.

609
01:14:21.493 --> 01:14:26.421
Thank you very much for your help, and I
appreciate your service, all of your service.


610
01:14:29.435 --> 01:14:32.438
I just think she really needs a nap.

611
01:14:32.838 --> 01:14:35.608
You know? And a little bit of food,
and I can give her that.


612
01:14:35.708 --> 01:14:38.444
So if you could just let us go now,
that would be great.


613
01:14:38.544 --> 01:14:43.538
If you could just let us go,
we won't cause any trouble, or anything.


614
01:14:49.287 --> 01:14:50.689
We're gonna have to write this up.

615
01:14:50.789 --> 01:14:52.892
Oh, come on, Timmy,
there's something not right here.


616
01:14:52.992 --> 01:14:56.028
- What else can we do?
- Take her in as a 5150.


617
01:14:56.128 --> 01:14:58.731
You wanna do the paperwork on that?

618
01:14:58.831 --> 01:15:02.991
Come on, Marie. 
My Tammy's about her age.

619
01:15:05.170 --> 01:15:09.424
- You know how females are.
- Oh, right, she may be on her period?


620
01:15:09.524 --> 01:15:13.667
- Officer, I...
- Miss, you need to stay where you were!


621
01:15:14.113 --> 01:15:18.406
Sorry, you know...
you know, it's just I was...


622
01:15:19.785 --> 01:15:23.711
There's something that I didn't tell you
that I didn't want to say in front of him.


623
01:15:26.024 --> 01:15:27.129
I didn't tell you all the truth.

624
01:15:27.229 --> 01:15:30.616
I'm supposed to tell the whole truth and nothing
but the truth, but I left something out.


625
01:15:30.716 --> 01:15:32.431
'Cause you see, there was this boy.

626
01:15:32.531 --> 01:15:37.158
Okay. It's your call,
but if anything goes wrong, it's on you.


627
01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:45.611
Miss, we're gonna, take you back to
your home here in the patrol car, okay?


628
01:15:45.711 --> 01:15:48.814
- Home? Home.
- Yes.


629
01:15:48.914 --> 01:15:51.439
- It's okay. Come on.
- Okay.


630
01:15:52.317 --> 01:15:55.276
- Thank you so much, Officer.
- You're welcome.


631
01:16:02.895 --> 01:16:05.397
Jenn, just relax, okay?

632
01:16:05.497 --> 01:16:08.447
And lean back so
I can get your front.

633
01:16:13.972 --> 01:16:16.175
We need to talk.

634
01:16:16.275 --> 01:16:18.133
Talk.

635
01:16:23.015 --> 01:16:28.164
You always had such great nipples,
I never understand why Trevor didn't...


636
01:16:33.492 --> 01:16:36.483
Fuck, you scared the
shit out of me today.

637
01:16:48.173 --> 01:16:50.676
I don't really wanna have
to do any of this,


638
01:16:50.776 --> 01:16:56.171
but you give me no other choice.

639
01:17:12.965 --> 01:17:15.991
I thought you wanted
to get rid of me.

640
01:17:18.203 --> 01:17:21.006
Of course not, no.
I never wanted that, Jennifer.


641
01:17:21.106 --> 01:17:25.166
You are all I have.
I don't know what I would do if you...


642
01:17:39.257 --> 01:17:41.116
Come on.

643
01:17:45.198 --> 01:17:47.589
- What?
- It's cold.


644
01:17:48.267 --> 01:17:52.938
It's warm. Jennifer, no.
Look, hey, look it's steaming.


645
01:17:53.038 --> 01:17:56.731
Look, look. Take your hand. See?

646
01:17:58.410 --> 01:18:00.012
It's warm.

647
01:18:00.112 --> 01:18:02.576
Look, you see? It's warm.

648
01:18:08.186 --> 01:18:10.579
It's been so hard.

649
01:18:16.929 --> 01:18:19.687
I've been trying my best.

650
01:18:20.232 --> 01:18:22.969
After everything with Trevor...

651
01:18:23.669 --> 01:18:26.773
I've just been trying to get myself back.

652
01:18:28.473 --> 01:18:31.833
- I know.
- So many expectations.


653
01:18:32.377 --> 01:18:35.670
- I just want to be free.
- Yeah.


654
01:18:40.152 --> 01:18:42.043
Jilly?

655
01:18:42.621 --> 01:18:44.199
Yeah?

656
01:18:44.299 --> 01:18:48.683
You absolutely must take your cooking
and share it with the world.


657
01:18:51.863 --> 01:18:54.199
Those are just experiments.

658
01:18:54.299 --> 01:18:58.036
But look at your resolve.

659
01:18:58.136 --> 01:19:02.297
You can do it, I know you want to.
I can even help.


660
01:19:06.644 --> 01:19:08.947
- Help?
- Of course.


661
01:19:09.047 --> 01:19:12.407
With our combined powers
we'll be unstoppable.


662
01:19:15.053 --> 01:19:18.373
- I'm glad we're talking.
- Yeah.


663
01:19:22.060 --> 01:19:25.019
Help! Somebody!

664
01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.257
Fucking kidding me?

665
01:19:35.774 --> 01:19:39.211
You need to look in the mirror.
Crazy bitch.


666
01:19:39.311 --> 01:19:41.870
You have no right to judge me.

667
01:20:06.204 --> 01:20:09.795
You know I'll fucking do it, right?
I'll fucking do it right now!


668
01:20:11.243 --> 01:20:15.714
There's no turning back, bitch.

669
01:20:35.801 --> 01:20:39.260
You're not gonna fool me again.

670
01:21:03.996 --> 01:21:05.854
Sorry.

671
01:21:07.966 --> 01:21:09.824
Don't...

672
01:22:36.855 --> 01:22:39.148
It's a cinch.

673
01:22:50.835 --> 01:22:54.361
What the fuck?

674
01:24:05.277 --> 01:24:07.035
Enough is enough!

675
01:24:13.485 --> 01:24:15.710
Happy birthday!

676
01:24:16.721 --> 01:24:18.523
What?

677
01:24:18.623 --> 01:24:20.659
I didn't mean to be a Facebook stalker,

678
01:24:20.759 --> 01:24:25.005
but I couldn't help but see before...

679
01:24:25.105 --> 01:24:27.265
that your birthday was coming up.

680
01:24:27.365 --> 01:24:28.833
Um...

681
01:24:28.933 --> 01:24:33.471
Well, I just wanted to apologize
for being so pushy.


682
01:24:33.571 --> 01:24:38.009
I mean, sometimes my anal
retentiveness gets the best of me.


683
01:24:38.109 --> 01:24:40.401
Thanks for friending me.

684
01:24:43.915 --> 01:24:46.167
That's your way of apologizing?

685
01:24:46.267 --> 01:24:49.187
- Um...
- You know what?


686
01:24:49.287 --> 01:24:52.362
Everything Jennifer says about you...

687
01:24:53.467 --> 01:24:56.461
- is true.
- I don't understand.


688
01:24:56.561 --> 01:25:01.823
I... I just wanted to do something Ni...

689
01:25:07.752 --> 01:25:09.553
nice.

690
01:25:16.248 --> 01:25:19.006
I am on to you.

691
01:25:35.300 --> 01:25:38.034
It needs more salt.

692
01:25:48.380 --> 01:25:51.873
- Samantha Foxy?
- I know.


693
01:25:54.319 --> 01:25:57.178
- It's Rob.
- Let it go to voice-mail.


694
01:26:02.127 --> 01:26:03.983
Look...

695
01:26:04.483 --> 01:26:07.111
Look how fat she looks there.

696
01:26:08.066 --> 01:26:11.136
She's trying... she's trying
to do little arms back look.


697
01:26:11.236 --> 01:26:14.031
I know. Wait.

698
01:26:15.973 --> 01:26:18.001
Oh, my God. Why
would she wear that color?

699
01:26:18.201 --> 01:26:20.863
I don't know. Fucking looks like a bag.

700
01:26:22.347 --> 01:26:25.639
- Put a bag over her head.
- Old basket of rolls.


701
01:26:27.952 --> 01:26:31.078
She seriously looks
like a basket of rolls.


702
01:26:31.590 --> 01:26:34.548
Like really lumpy ones
that are two days old.


703
01:26:36.594 --> 01:26:38.486
Baguettes.

704
01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:45.069
Holla! Holla!

705
01:26:45.169 --> 01:26:48.462
- Holla!
- She's a holla back girl.


706
01:26:54.712 --> 01:26:56.837
Oh, listen, listen.

707
01:26:57.348 --> 01:27:00.018
Hey, it's Rob. 
Uh, this is hard.

708
01:27:00.118 --> 01:27:03.821
I really thought we had a
connection, but I can't...


709
01:27:03.921 --> 01:27:06.124
I can't even... I don't even
know what to call it.


710
01:27:06.224 --> 01:27:09.628
But I just can't do this anymore.
I mean us, and I can't...


711
01:27:09.828 --> 01:27:13.665
Why won't you let me help you?
What the fuck is wrong with you?


712
01:27:14.165 --> 01:27:19.140
God, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to lose
my temper. It's just, I wish you...


713
01:27:19.837 --> 01:27:23.008
Look, I understand what you're going
though, and I wish I could be better.


714
01:27:23.108 --> 01:27:25.143
But I have to...

715
01:27:25.243 --> 01:27:29.514
For the sake of my own sobriety,
I just... I can't see you anymore.


716
01:27:29.614 --> 01:27:31.872
My fucking God.

717
01:27:34.419 --> 01:27:38.456
- "For the sake of my own sobriety."
- Pussy.


718
01:27:38.556 --> 01:27:42.750
- Totes is a loser.
- Serio. Let the ruiner have him.


719
01:27:44.028 --> 01:27:46.483
- Lame.
- We don't need him.


720
01:27:46.583 --> 01:27:49.590
No. Wait.

721
01:27:51.402 --> 01:27:54.495
What do you mean... "we"?

722
01:27:58.143 --> 01:28:00.523
'Cause, you know...

723
01:28:01.223 --> 01:28:04.007
you never had him.

724
01:28:09.320 --> 01:28:11.145
Wait.

725
01:28:12.924 --> 01:28:14.826
Yes, you did.

726
01:28:14.926 --> 01:28:19.798
You did! It's not... it's not Cathy.
It's you, isn't it? Fuck.


727
01:28:19.898 --> 01:28:24.352
Fuck. Fuck. Why do you fuck everything up?

728
01:28:24.452 --> 01:28:26.711
Why do you do that?

729
01:28:29.340 --> 01:28:31.627
Fuck you!

730
01:28:32.528 --> 01:28:34.045
You think that you're just not gonna...

731
01:28:34.145 --> 01:28:36.448
you're just not gonna
have any consequences?


732
01:28:36.548 --> 01:28:40.708
That you're just gonna be able
to get away with it? What the fuck!


733
01:28:42.654 --> 01:28:46.458
You know what? You know what?
You're gonna be punished.


734
01:28:46.558 --> 01:28:49.093
Oh, yeah, you're going
to be fucking punished.


735
01:28:49.193 --> 01:28:53.835
You don't have any food. 
None today and...

736
01:28:53.935 --> 01:28:57.155
you're not going to have
any food tomorrow, either.


737
01:29:01.005 --> 01:29:03.898
You fucking bitch!

738
01:29:06.310 --> 01:29:11.149
God, why am I even your friend?

739
01:29:11.349 --> 01:29:14.242
Why would you tell me that?

740
01:29:25.663 --> 01:29:27.815
You...

741
01:29:27.915 --> 01:29:30.575
are the ruiner...

742
01:29:30.675 --> 01:29:33.455
of everything.

743
01:29:49.787 --> 01:29:52.457
Me and Rob, we could...

744
01:29:52.557 --> 01:29:54.882
and everything.

745
01:31:14.705 --> 01:31:17.131
What are you still doing here?

746
01:31:20.745 --> 01:31:24.869
Jennifer, wake up!
Wake up, it's dinner time.


747
01:31:26.084 --> 01:31:28.108
Wake up.

748
01:31:32.657 --> 01:31:35.270
You will eat...

749
01:31:35.370 --> 01:31:39.686
You will... submissive...

750
01:31:45.949 --> 01:31:48.528
I see you.

751
01:31:52.312 --> 01:31:55.516
No one will ever...
No one will ever love you.


752
01:31:55.616 --> 01:31:57.985
You don't deserve it.

753
01:31:58.385 --> 01:32:00.887
Stupid, ugly...

754
01:32:00.987 --> 01:32:04.890
Useless, waste.

755
01:32:09.555 --> 01:32:13.443
I can smell you.
I can smell your weakness.


756
01:32:17.238 --> 01:32:20.398
Weak... stupid...

757
01:32:20.498 --> 01:32:22.672
cunt.

758
01:32:24.225 --> 01:32:26.614
I hate you.

759
01:32:27.114 --> 01:32:30.114
I hate you, I hate you.

760
01:32:30.214 --> 01:32:32.840
I'm not going anywhere.

761
01:36:16.874 --> 01:36:18.799
Arms.

762
01:36:27.618 --> 01:36:29.743
Suck that in.

763
01:36:40.898 --> 01:36:44.658
This is... fashion week.

764
01:36:47.505 --> 01:36:49.340
She's back.

765
01:36:49.440 --> 01:36:52.833
- Really?
- I just saw her.


766
01:36:53.477 --> 01:36:55.902
Tell her to come to my office.

767
01:37:00.518 --> 01:37:03.009
Were you held hostage?

768
01:37:05.423 --> 01:37:07.758
Points for showing up on the big week.

769
01:37:07.858 --> 01:37:10.417
The outfit is an improvement.

770
01:37:11.228 --> 01:37:13.698
But no matter what this town tells you...

771
01:37:13.798 --> 01:37:16.356
flakiness is not fashionable.

772
01:37:21.839 --> 01:37:23.897
You're fired.

773
01:37:29.046 --> 01:37:31.271
Eat a sandwich.

774
01:37:38.496 --> 01:37:41.442
I think you've made
a hasty decision, Nina.


775
01:37:41.542 --> 01:37:43.895
Get up, we need to talk.

776
01:37:43.995 --> 01:37:47.739
Come on, come on.
Fashion waits for no one.


777
01:38:10.357 --> 01:38:13.481
Let's have some lunch and talk.

778
01:38:27.441 --> 01:38:30.642
I've made a great meal.
I've made a great meal.


779
01:38:31.958 --> 01:38:36.890
I love cooking, but it's the eating
part that doesn't do it for me.


780
01:38:43.652 --> 01:38:48.103
I can't tell you how happy I am
to be working here with you, Nina.


781
01:38:55.652 --> 01:38:59.167
No matter what we decide I'm happy...

782
01:38:59.767 --> 01:39:02.018
about everything.

783
01:39:10.713 --> 01:39:13.205
Everything is perfect.
