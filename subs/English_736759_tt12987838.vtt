1
00:00:07.768 --> 00:00:10.935
AN ORIGINAL NETFLIX SERIES

2
00:00:46.143 --> 00:00:49.851
My initial interest in The Witcher was
born out of a fortuitous experience


3
00:00:49.935 --> 00:00:51.268
with the video game The Witcher.

4
00:00:51.685 --> 00:00:55.185
Then I heard that Netflix
was going to do a series and…


5
00:00:55.685 --> 00:00:59.060
… I looked for the
opportunity to play Geralt


6
00:00:59.143 --> 00:01:02.310
and when I spoke...
In the first meeting with Lauren,


7
00:01:03.476 --> 00:01:05.935
she mentioned that it was based on books.

8
00:01:06.101 --> 00:01:07.976
I just loved the books

9
00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.685
and they are an extraordinary
source of a fantastic story.


10
00:01:12.476 --> 00:01:15.143
Andrzej Sapkowski is the one
who wrote this series of books.


11
00:01:15.226 --> 00:01:17.018
Talking to him about them is fascinating.

12
00:01:17.101 --> 00:01:19.893
He traveled all over the
world, as a street vendor,


13
00:01:20.185 --> 00:01:23.435
and started by writing the original
short story for The Witcher,


14
00:01:23.518 --> 00:01:26.018
which he later presented to
a magazine and was published,


15
00:01:26.101 --> 00:01:30.351
but it was never your intention
for this to get where it did.


16
00:01:33.018 --> 00:01:35.185
There is something unique about the way

17
00:01:36.143 --> 00:01:40.185
Andrzej Sapkowski wrote The Witcher.

18
00:01:40.268 --> 00:01:44.393
It is a tough world, but it is related,
with some extraordinary characters.


19
00:01:44.476 --> 00:01:46.768
It was necessary to remember
to the south who is the queen.


20
00:01:46.851 --> 00:01:50.101
And what excited me the most
when I introduced it to Netflix…


21
00:01:50.185 --> 00:01:51.393
What did you want?

22
00:01:51.476 --> 00:01:55.393
… Went to plant the seeds for the meeting
between Geralt, Ciri and Yennefer.


23
00:01:56.393 --> 00:01:58.643
Find Rivia's Geralt.

24
00:01:59.143 --> 00:02:01.851
It took some time.
I created several versions


25
00:02:01.935 --> 00:02:05.351
and I literally had one of those
"Aha!" moments in the shower.


26
00:02:05.435 --> 00:02:08.185
"I will be able to tell these
three stories at the same time"


27
00:02:08.268 --> 00:02:10.643
without being too confused?

28
00:02:11.143 --> 00:02:13.393
It is been interesting,
because I think


29
00:02:13.476 --> 00:02:15.643
that the current television
audience is very astute.


30
00:02:15.726 --> 00:02:19.185
And as writers and creators,
we have that going for us.


31
00:02:19.268 --> 00:02:23.351
So there are a lot of leaps in time,
but I think it’s an exciting trip


32
00:02:23.435 --> 00:02:25.435
for fans and... you know,

33
00:02:25.518 --> 00:02:28.060
even for those who didn't know The Witcher.

34
00:02:31.226 --> 00:02:34.018
The most interesting thing
is to dive into these stories


35
00:02:34.101 --> 00:02:37.185
and one of the first things I did
when they approved The Witcher


36
00:02:37.393 --> 00:02:41.518
went to buy a plane ticket to
Poland, because I wanted to know


37
00:02:41.601 --> 00:02:44.560
why the series of books was
so important for the country


38
00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.601
and how it reflected people's spirit.

39
00:02:47.685 --> 00:02:51.268
It was important for me to
develop the series as a whole.


40
00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.726
THE HISTORY IN THE LINES

41
00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.060
<i>The Witcher</i> is a big part of
me, I think.


42
00:03:01.268 --> 00:03:03.268
<i>The Witcher</i> has become part of my...

43
00:03:03.351 --> 00:03:04.435
EXECUTIVE PRODUCER

44
00:03:04.518 --> 00:03:07.268
… Brain, body and
mind for a long time.

45
00:03:07.351 --> 00:03:10.768
But for the rest of the world,
<i>The Witcher</i> is a fantastic story,


46
00:03:10.851 --> 00:03:13.851
a fantastic character,
a fantastic world.


47
00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.060
For the kingdom and the glory.

48
00:03:16.143 --> 00:03:18.810
Tomek Baginski,
one of our Polish producers,


49
00:03:19.101 --> 00:03:19.935
ART DIRECTOR

50
00:03:20.018 --> 00:03:22.685
is well versed in the books
and culture of <i>The Witcher</i>


51
00:03:22.768 --> 00:03:23.851
and there are certain things

52
00:03:23.935 --> 00:03:26.268
which are not necessarily
explained in the guidelines.


53
00:03:26.351 --> 00:03:30.310
In such cases,
we consult with Tomek and his team,


54
00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.060
to ensure fidelity to
the original material.


55
00:03:33.143 --> 00:03:35.851
It is a big part of Poland's
pop culture history,


56
00:03:35.976 --> 00:03:39.310
which is also very important, 
I think, and...

57
00:03:39.726 --> 00:03:45.310
it is a game, a book,
a television series, it is many things.


58
00:03:45.393 --> 00:03:50.143
It is very difficult to circumscribe
<i>The Witcher</i> to a simple explanation.


59
00:03:51.476 --> 00:03:54.351
And I hope that we can
introduce this world to…


60
00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.560
… A much wider audience.

61
00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.726
I like to say that in this series,

62
00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.851
we can see the story that goes
between the lines of the books.


63
00:04:04.101 --> 00:04:06.851
We want to make a faithful
representation of the books


64
00:04:06.935 --> 00:04:08.726
and we try to respect that material,

65
00:04:08.976 --> 00:04:11.018
but books also omit many things.

66
00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:13.435
That wing ْ de is
mine, give it back to me!

67
00:04:13.518 --> 00:04:16.476
Many new ideas came out
of the screenwriters room,


68
00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.893
some of them very risky,
but all brilliant.


69
00:04:21.976 --> 00:04:23.935
In the screenplay room of <i>The Witcher…</i>

70
00:04:24.018 --> 00:04:25.018
SCREENPLAY 
- EPIS DIO 5

71
00:04:25.101 --> 00:04:28.851
… We got together and
discussed ideas for a while,


72
00:04:28.935 --> 00:04:32.810
until we have a clear idea of ​​what
we are going to do this season.


73
00:04:33.226 --> 00:04:36.935
After doing this,
we focus on individual episodes


74
00:04:37.018 --> 00:04:40.351
and we are going to get material from the
books. We thought, "What parts of the books"


75
00:04:40.435 --> 00:04:43.143
do we want to include this season?

76
00:04:43.893 --> 00:04:45.143
After we decide that,

77
00:04:45.393 --> 00:04:48.768
Lauren tells us to write
our guide individually


78
00:04:49.226 --> 00:04:54.893
and we have some arcs that go
from one episode to another


79
00:04:54.976 --> 00:04:57.601
that we continue to
discuss to make sure


80
00:04:57.685 --> 00:05:00.268
that we are always giving new
information to the viewer.


81
00:05:01.226 --> 00:05:04.018
When they entrust us
with a guide, it is…

82
00:05:04.393 --> 00:05:07.435
It is very exciting, we think:
"I will deal with this story, great!"


83
00:05:07.518 --> 00:05:08.518
SCREENPLAY 
- EPIS DIO 4

84
00:05:08.601 --> 00:05:11.185
When the Law of Surprise came to
me, some said:


85
00:05:11.268 --> 00:05:14.935
"I am glad I didn't get that one!"
Because it is difficult to explain.


86
00:05:15.018 --> 00:05:16.726
Request payment with the Law of Surprise

87
00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:18.685
it is as old as humanity itself.

88
00:05:18.768 --> 00:05:21.143
- Do not give me sermons, Eist.
- It is a fair bet.


89
00:05:21.685 --> 00:05:24.018
Whose reward can be so much…

90
00:05:24.268 --> 00:05:27.893
… Plentiful harvest, a puppy or…

91
00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:30.226
… A surprised child.

92
00:05:30.976 --> 00:05:32.018
Try to explain it

93
00:05:33.226 --> 00:05:36.226
in a guide, in a way that does
not cause the actor to look at us


94
00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:37.810
and give us a snap?

95
00:05:37.893 --> 00:05:40.226
It was difficult, but essentially, this is it.

96
00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:44.018
The Law of Surprise, in
short, is to take something


97
00:05:45.351 --> 00:05:46.476
from the other person...

98
00:05:47.601 --> 00:05:50.143
... which is a surprise.
When they return to that house,


99
00:05:50.226 --> 00:05:53.351
the first thing they find whose
owner didn’t know they owned the


100
00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.476
before they left, that is it.

101
00:05:55.893 --> 00:05:56.726
Fuck it.

102
00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:00.643
Yes, there are many different ideas
and many different perspectives...


103
00:06:00.726 --> 00:06:01.768
SCREENPLAY 
- EPIS DIO 3

104
00:06:01.851 --> 00:06:04.018
... which is important,
because in the last analysis...


105
00:06:05.018 --> 00:06:10.851
… It is about all these different
groups, like elves, gnomes, dwarfs


106
00:06:10.935 --> 00:06:12.768
and their perspectives on the world.

107
00:06:12.851 --> 00:06:15.851
So, having the freedom to
represent that kind of…


108
00:06:16.226 --> 00:06:19.226
… Diversity is very
useful to tell the story.


109
00:06:21.101 --> 00:06:25.643
What is great about this and
what we did with the story


110
00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:32.226
is that we focus on humanity
and all human conflicts.


111
00:06:32.643 --> 00:06:34.768
One of the most
interesting things for me


112
00:06:34.851 --> 00:06:36.726
it is the women in the books.

113
00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:41.893
They are very strong women,
those around Geralt, the protagonist.


114
00:06:42.643 --> 00:06:45.768
So I asked Andrzej:
"For books written in the 1980s",


115
00:06:45.851 --> 00:06:47.851
it is surprising that
women are so strong.


116
00:06:47.935 --> 00:06:51.601
And he says to me: "You never
knew my mother, did you?"


117
00:06:52.476 --> 00:06:56.351
He wanted to say that the
nation was so devastated by war,


118
00:06:56.435 --> 00:06:57.685
scene of so many conflicts,

119
00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:00.310
who lost many of their men

120
00:07:00.893 --> 00:07:06.101
in these conflicts and women have
become the pillars of communities,


121
00:07:06.185 --> 00:07:09.143
even in the workplace,
not just at home.


122
00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:13.393
That was the spirit that
Andrzej brought to these books.


123
00:07:13.476 --> 00:07:15.268
These characters are survivors.

124
00:07:18.101 --> 00:07:21.476
When I went to do the
audition… There were two scenes


125
00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:23.601
that had been written for the hearing,

126
00:07:23.685 --> 00:07:29.268
and one of them was between her
and Geralt and she was quite


127
00:07:30.101 --> 00:07:32.143
combative and stubborn.

128
00:07:33.643 --> 00:07:35.768
And then, in the other scene, she had...

129
00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:39.018
I was trying to convince
someone not to stay and die


130
00:07:39.101 --> 00:07:43.310
and she was... 
A showed her heart,

131
00:07:43.393 --> 00:07:46.768
and a more loving side.

132
00:07:47.226 --> 00:07:50.726
So, I liked the fact that
it shows these two faces,


133
00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:54.060
in the audition scenes,
instead of just being, like:


134
00:07:54.143 --> 00:07:57.601
"She is going to be
a cool and tough girl",

135
00:07:57.685 --> 00:08:00.060
which is fantastic, but it also showed

136
00:08:00.685 --> 00:08:06.726
another, gentler, softer force.

137
00:08:09.143 --> 00:08:14.143
It shouldn't have been an easy
task to find an actress who could


138
00:08:14.935 --> 00:08:19.935
embody a character like Ciri,
who is so rooted in folklore


139
00:08:20.018 --> 00:08:25.560
and such an important character.
Ciri has a lot to offer.


140
00:08:25.643 --> 00:08:29.893
Ciri is this whole world. It is the
key to almost all the characters.


141
00:08:29.976 --> 00:08:32.685
It is the element that unites everyone.

142
00:08:33.143 --> 00:08:37.393
Whenever it appears on the screen,
there is something truly special about it.


143
00:08:37.476 --> 00:08:39.601
There is something magical in her eyes...

144
00:08:39.685 --> 00:08:40.518
EXECUTIVE PRODUCER

145
00:08:40.601 --> 00:08:42.768
... and I think it has
to do with the character,


146
00:08:42.851 --> 00:08:45.351
you know, Ciri has that thing inside her

147
00:08:45.435 --> 00:08:48.976
and she is young, still
not sure what it is

148
00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:52.810
and I think Freya did a fantastic
job of playing the character.


149
00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:56.268
What we did was pick up the books

150
00:08:56.351 --> 00:08:57.685
and look for all the parts

151
00:08:57.768 --> 00:09:00.560
where Andrzej spoke about
the past of these characters


152
00:09:00.643 --> 00:09:03.643
and from all of that,
we will create a new story


153
00:09:03.726 --> 00:09:05.476
for Ciri and Yennefer,

154
00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:08.060
to thoroughly investigate its origins,

155
00:09:08.143 --> 00:09:11.435
because, for me, it is necessary to
find the characters, to understand them


156
00:09:11.518 --> 00:09:14.143
and then see how they
change when they meet.


157
00:09:14.226 --> 00:09:15.768
It is the most exciting part.

158
00:09:16.143 --> 00:09:17.351
Before we met,

159
00:09:18.226 --> 00:09:19.351
the days were calm...

160
00:09:20.851 --> 00:09:23.435
… And busy nights.  But now…

161
00:09:25.101 --> 00:09:26.601
… you are important to me.

162
00:09:30.601 --> 00:09:32.393
We have a rough idea, in the room,

163
00:09:32.476 --> 00:09:34.310
of how it will
be and we discuss it.

164
00:09:34.393 --> 00:09:36.643
"These people are going this
way, this way there..."


165
00:09:37.185 --> 00:09:40.143
And then we have the joy
of going home to write,


166
00:09:40.226 --> 00:09:43.268
alone, out of the room
and think about cool shit


167
00:09:43.726 --> 00:09:44.851
and monsters, type

168
00:09:44.935 --> 00:09:47.560
"This is fantastic,
I can invent monsters!"


169
00:09:47.643 --> 00:09:49.060
Who doesn't want to do this?

170
00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:52.018
MONSTERS AND MONEY

171
00:09:52.101 --> 00:09:54.310
The world of monsters and men

172
00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:55.976
in <i>The Witcher…</i>

173
00:09:56.518 --> 00:09:59.935
These worlds intermingle is very difficult…

174
00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:03.351
… Draw a clear line and
say, "Okay,


175
00:10:03.435 --> 00:10:07.810
humans are here and here the
world of monsters begins "


176
00:10:09.893 --> 00:10:13.226
The continent we know
was inhabited by elves.


177
00:10:14.601 --> 00:10:17.060
And when the Conjunction
of the Spheres took place,

178
00:10:17.143 --> 00:10:20.726
it opened the door to
monsters, many monsters.


179
00:10:22.685 --> 00:10:25.601
One of the most interesting
things about how these…


180
00:10:26.726 --> 00:10:29.685
… Species interact is…

181
00:10:30.685 --> 00:10:34.685
... that some do not belong to
this place we call the Continent,


182
00:10:34.768 --> 00:10:37.601
and, in fact, of all the monsters
that populate the Continent,


183
00:10:37.893 --> 00:10:40.185
some are made of wool,
others are created by magic


184
00:10:40.685 --> 00:10:41.893
and others,

185
00:10:41.976 --> 00:10:45.351
despite being monsters,
or being considered monsters,


186
00:10:46.185 --> 00:10:48.976
come from a different site or
from several different sites


187
00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:50.518
and them…

188
00:10:51.643 --> 00:10:53.893
… Probably see humanity

189
00:10:54.476 --> 00:10:57.143
as monsters, as we see them.

190
00:11:00.351 --> 00:11:03.143
This is all due to something called
the "Conjunction of the Spheres".


191
00:11:03.226 --> 00:11:04.810
Basically, it is what it sounds like.

192
00:11:04.893 --> 00:11:10.226
Is a series of different dimensions
that collide with each other


193
00:11:10.601 --> 00:11:12.893
and change the world as we know it.

194
00:11:14.393 --> 00:11:16.476
In fact, it is a refugee situation.

195
00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:20.810
All these creatures and beings from
another universe came to a stop


196
00:11:20.893 --> 00:11:23.268
to this continent,
which is not theirs, as refugees,


197
00:11:23.351 --> 00:11:26.976
and humans were the only ones
sufficiently barbaric and bellicose,


198
00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:30.560
in addition to taking advantage
of the magic of the Ancient Races,


199
00:11:30.643 --> 00:11:35.476
to take the Continent and drive
the elves out of their land.


200
00:11:36.476 --> 00:11:37.518
Strangely enough,

201
00:11:37.893 --> 00:11:41.851
all the inhabitants of this
world are visitors in this world.


202
00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:43.476
Something existed here before.

203
00:11:44.101 --> 00:11:45.643
We do not know the details,

204
00:11:45.976 --> 00:11:48.601
but monsters, dwarves and humans

205
00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:50.351
they all arrived later.

206
00:11:52.685 --> 00:11:56.393
Given that we are going to create this
world from a holistic perspective,


207
00:11:56.643 --> 00:11:59.518
I took on the design of
the creature concepts


208
00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:02.976
and, for a large number of
creatures, I had the opportunity


209
00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:07.101
to do the initial <i>design</i> of
some, which later passed


210
00:12:07.185 --> 00:12:08.726
or the prosthesis team,

211
00:12:09.268 --> 00:12:13.018
to create physical creatures,
or the visual effects team,


212
00:12:13.476 --> 00:12:16.310
to create the three-dimensional models

213
00:12:16.393 --> 00:12:17.643
of the animated versions.

214
00:12:21.935 --> 00:12:24.768
And many of the
creatures we work on…


215
00:12:24.851 --> 00:12:25.726
CREATOR OF PR ES TESES

216
00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:27.935
… Resulted from a combined effort

217
00:12:28.018 --> 00:12:30.685
with the visual effects
department, because,


218
00:12:30.768 --> 00:12:33.643
sometimes the creature was

219
00:12:34.185 --> 00:12:37.560
totally designed by the
visual effects department,


220
00:12:37.643 --> 00:12:43.101
with certain parts built by
us to allow physical contact


221
00:12:44.101 --> 00:12:44.935
with the actors

222
00:12:45.393 --> 00:12:48.643
and sometimes the creature
was totally built physically.


223
00:12:49.185 --> 00:12:52.685
One of the most interesting
things in creating creatures


224
00:12:52.768 --> 00:12:55.726
went to work with
Tomek Baginski and talk


225
00:12:55.810 --> 00:12:59.518
about mythology and Slavic fairy
tales and include certain elements


226
00:12:59.601 --> 00:13:03.435
in the creatures that are
faithful to these stories.


227
00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:08.935
We talk a lot about monsters
in the world of <i>The Witcher,</i>


228
00:13:09.018 --> 00:13:11.435
but in fact, in the original books,

229
00:13:11.893 --> 00:13:14.560
the wizard doesn’t fight
monsters that often,


230
00:13:14.768 --> 00:13:17.268
because this is a moment in
the history of this world


231
00:13:17.351 --> 00:13:19.851
where the monsters are

232
00:13:20.393 --> 00:13:23.310
forced to abandon natural
<i>habitats</i> by people,


233
00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:28.310
and, at some point,
we realized that maybe it is the monsters


234
00:13:28.393 --> 00:13:30.185
in need of protection.

235
00:13:35.268 --> 00:13:38.601
THE LIMITS OF THE WORLD

236
00:13:38.685 --> 00:13:41.643
The stories unfold in a place
called the "Continent",


237
00:13:41.726 --> 00:13:43.268
with a capital letter, "Continent".

238
00:13:43.351 --> 00:13:47.018
It is an extensive world, which we will
continue to explore throughout the series.


239
00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:53.560
I think the most intriguing thing about
this project is the creation of the world.


240
00:13:54.893 --> 00:13:57.393
This was a great opportunity

241
00:13:57.476 --> 00:14:00.726
to create an entire environment from scratch.

242
00:14:01.601 --> 00:14:05.018
And for an art director,
this is golden dust.


243
00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:10.560
We want to give the
Continent a more global look.


244
00:14:12.643 --> 00:14:16.726
In many ways, the world of <i>The
Witcher</i> is very much based in Europe


245
00:14:17.351 --> 00:14:18.601
and we feel,

246
00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:21.768
and we discussed it right from the
start, which we want to build


247
00:14:22.476 --> 00:14:25.768
this world with influences
from many other places.


248
00:14:25.851 --> 00:14:27.726
Many other cultural references.

249
00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:34.685
We draw ideas from Japanese,
Indian architecture


250
00:14:34.768 --> 00:14:36.351
and the Middle East,

251
00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:39.393
to give the continent
a sense of scale.


252
00:14:39.476 --> 00:14:42.476
In order not to feel that everything
is happening in one region.


253
00:14:43.685 --> 00:14:45.101
So, let's play a little

254
00:14:45.601 --> 00:14:49.726
with architectural realities.
In architecture, say, by Aretuza,


255
00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:53.935
for example, the facade of the
island of Thanedd is quite high.


256
00:14:54.101 --> 00:14:58.226
And the question arises, like:
"Wow, where did this come from?


257
00:14:58.310 --> 00:15:01.060
How did you get it?
"Because we want this juxtaposition"


258
00:15:01.143 --> 00:15:04.643
with the most humane
architecture, like: "Very well",


259
00:15:04.726 --> 00:15:07.060
we understand how to build a castle.

260
00:15:07.976 --> 00:15:10.935
But I think that mixing these
two things is very important.


261
00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:17.393
It takes place in a kind of
medieval period, but that said...


262
00:15:17.476 --> 00:15:18.310
COSTUME DESIGNER

263
00:15:18.351 --> 00:15:22.810
… The influences that I decided
to use are genetic of all periods.


264
00:15:23.393 --> 00:15:26.601
So, I chose that and
a lot of haute couture

265
00:15:27.268 --> 00:15:30.101
and another idea

266
00:15:30.185 --> 00:15:32.560
I used was to use
tissue manipulation,


267
00:15:32.643 --> 00:15:36.976
which, at this moment,
is a relevant technique in haute couture,


268
00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:38.976
but that has been used throughout history,

269
00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:43.435
and that basically involves
pleats, drapes,


270
00:15:43.518 --> 00:15:49.143
pleats, different ways to
transform plain to textured fabric


271
00:15:49.226 --> 00:15:51.768
without adding embellishments

272
00:15:51.851 --> 00:15:55.101
or any type of addition.

273
00:15:55.185 --> 00:15:57.518
So, create an architectural form

274
00:15:57.601 --> 00:16:02.101
and creates a visually
interesting surface for the suit.


275
00:16:02.726 --> 00:16:05.560
As for the world,
including the costumes and sets,


276
00:16:06.018 --> 00:16:08.268
it seems to me a
world that has been found.

277
00:16:08.351 --> 00:16:11.226
Not a make-believe
or invented world.


278
00:16:11.310 --> 00:16:14.560
It looks like we’ll find him,
and for a story like <i>The Witcher,</i>


279
00:16:14.643 --> 00:16:17.435
this is very important,
because it gives it realism.


280
00:16:17.518 --> 00:16:19.851
One of the major issues
discussed was that


281
00:16:19.935 --> 00:16:23.518
this is not a terrestrial story.
The Continent is the Continent


282
00:16:23.601 --> 00:16:25.601
and it has its own rules.

283
00:16:27.476 --> 00:16:30.976
It has the Ancient Races and it has
a history and there are monoliths


284
00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:34.060
and, there are… In
a way, we will withdraw

285
00:16:34.143 --> 00:16:37.601
layers, like an onion,
right from the first season


286
00:16:37.685 --> 00:16:40.935
and there are many more layers ahead.

287
00:16:41.976 --> 00:16:45.560
We want to be able to hint at
it, to give a glimpse


288
00:16:45.643 --> 00:16:48.601
of what might be revealed
as we go through the story.


289
00:16:50.018 --> 00:16:52.893
It is a world
of magic and, if so...

290
00:16:53.310 --> 00:16:55.476
... there are no limits.
We can do anything.


291
00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:56.768
Got it!

292
00:16:56.851 --> 00:16:59.768
But this also implies many
conflicts and dangers.


293
00:17:00.976 --> 00:17:02.810
It is a very black world

294
00:17:03.851 --> 00:17:05.185
and violent.

295
00:17:07.643 --> 00:17:10.601
THE DRIVING CHAOS

296
00:17:10.685 --> 00:17:13.893
Where we focus on this,
in practical terms, is:


297
00:17:14.185 --> 00:17:16.935
"How does magic work in our series?"

298
00:17:17.435 --> 00:17:19.976
Magic is very interesting.
We call it "chaos".


299
00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:22.976
And the coolest scene of
playing with chaos is that


300
00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:25.060
we always say that it
is a give and take.

301
00:17:25.143 --> 00:17:28.976
We don’t want to do a series
where the characters can use magic


302
00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:32.851
to get in or out of any complicated
situation. There is no drama in that.


303
00:17:32.976 --> 00:17:34.101
I am doing it!

304
00:17:34.185 --> 00:17:35.310
Your hand!

305
00:17:40.518 --> 00:17:42.018
Chaos is everywhere.

306
00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:45.726
We live in a world where there
can be and there is immense chaos,


307
00:17:45.810 --> 00:17:48.143
and where there are
people who have the capacity

308
00:17:48.226 --> 00:17:51.518
to control chaos
and make it positive


309
00:17:51.601 --> 00:17:54.393
or contain it in a way that
is no longer dangerous.


310
00:17:55.143 --> 00:17:57.393
The magic is...

311
00:17:58.310 --> 00:18:00.810
Each person uses it differently,

312
00:18:01.435 --> 00:18:05.268
depending on how you inherited it

313
00:18:05.768 --> 00:18:09.185
and the way you channel it.
There is a certain discipline and…


314
00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:11.643
… Not everyone succeeds.

315
00:18:13.768 --> 00:18:16.435
When we start shooting,

316
00:18:16.518 --> 00:18:19.435
"and the guide said, like ...
and Mousesack makes a wall appear."


317
00:18:19.518 --> 00:18:24.893
Or something like that and, you
know, I am there with the director


318
00:18:24.976 --> 00:18:28.893
and Lauren Hissrich,
the <i>showrunner,</i> and I say, "Okay,


319
00:18:29.351 --> 00:18:31.601
I think this is how Mousesack should...

320
00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:34.435
… Concentrate the energy in the room

321
00:18:35.101 --> 00:18:37.143
and... What do you think?

322
00:18:38.476 --> 00:18:40.101
So, we tried several things.

323
00:18:40.601 --> 00:18:44.518
It has to be something supernatural
and it must come from something unique


324
00:18:44.851 --> 00:18:47.268
that we feel it
provides powerful energy


325
00:18:48.018 --> 00:18:49.893
and, after all, you know,

326
00:18:50.726 --> 00:18:55.601
everything is calm and,
out of chaos, control arises.


327
00:19:00.685 --> 00:19:02.310
Initially, at the hearing...

328
00:19:03.685 --> 00:19:05.935
I knew almost nothing
about Yennefer.


329
00:19:06.976 --> 00:19:10.435
Just the power she had in
the scene that I was playing,


330
00:19:11.351 --> 00:19:12.476
and…

331
00:19:13.476 --> 00:19:18.185
... then, I studied the
character, obviously, and...


332
00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:21.060
... I got to know her through books.

333
00:19:23.518 --> 00:19:27.935
And I was curious to know why
she presented herself that way


334
00:19:28.018 --> 00:19:33.643
and wanted to find
out what her fight was.

335
00:19:33.726 --> 00:19:37.018
And I think, for any actor,

336
00:19:38.685 --> 00:19:41.060
the arc through which it passes

337
00:19:41.851 --> 00:19:45.226
it is an incredible challenge.

338
00:19:46.393 --> 00:19:53.393
And I love to find out more about
it, the more I read


339
00:19:53.476 --> 00:19:56.393
and more I interpret it, I suppose.

340
00:19:58.226 --> 00:20:03.476
Anya brought a depth to the role
of Yennefer that is extraordinary.


341
00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:09.810
I think that both fans and beginners
will fall in love with her.


342
00:20:10.685 --> 00:20:13.185
It was very important to have a
character, or an actress,


343
00:20:13.268 --> 00:20:16.143
that managed to go through the
transformation that was necessary,


344
00:20:16.226 --> 00:20:18.976
who looked very young but who
managed, physically,


345
00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:21.726
to embody someone with
Yennefer’s shortcomings,


346
00:20:22.476 --> 00:20:27.935
and then become an
incredibly powerful figure.


347
00:20:28.685 --> 00:20:32.643
But also a figure that is broken,
that is desperately divided.


348
00:20:32.726 --> 00:20:35.601
So, we need someone
with talent for all this


349
00:20:35.685 --> 00:20:36.851
and Anya has it,

350
00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:38.393
to the carts.

351
00:20:38.976 --> 00:20:41.726
UNITED BY DESTINATION

352
00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:45.935
At the center of our series are
Geralt, Yennefer and Ciri.


353
00:20:46.018 --> 00:20:48.393
And what is fun in the first season

354
00:20:48.476 --> 00:20:51.560
is that the three are never in
the same place at the same time.


355
00:20:51.643 --> 00:20:55.851
They are in a kind of
crash course on each other.


356
00:20:56.393 --> 00:20:58.976
I think the parallel timelines

357
00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:02.685
are a very interesting
mechanism for telling the story


358
00:21:02.768 --> 00:21:05.685
and I think the most interesting
thing about these parallel lines


359
00:21:05.768 --> 00:21:09.768
is that when we start to see it,
we see it from a perspective,


360
00:21:10.185 --> 00:21:13.726
and at some point,
when we realize that the stories converge,


361
00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:16.810
I think it’s very interesting
to go back and review,


362
00:21:16.893 --> 00:21:20.476
looking for times when
someone looks at someone else


363
00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:24.685
and we see it from a completely
different perspective.


364
00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:30.685
What is great about Destiny
is that it is an end


365
00:21:30.768 --> 00:21:33.643
that results from the choices we make.

366
00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:38.726
And this is how we see the first
season, as a series of choices


367
00:21:38.810 --> 00:21:41.143
that take the characters in
the direction of the others.


368
00:21:41.476 --> 00:21:45.810
And I think what Lauren and
her team wrote very well


369
00:21:45.893 --> 00:21:50.435
it was characters that made sense,
that look like people like you or me,


370
00:21:50.518 --> 00:21:54.351
who are normal people
in a fantasy world,


371
00:21:54.935 --> 00:21:58.018
and I think that’s why the
series will be so strong,


372
00:21:58.101 --> 00:22:01.768
because we empathize with them,
because we understand them.


373
00:22:03.310 --> 00:22:05.810
Everyone likes to see each other
in the stories, do not they?


374
00:22:05.893 --> 00:22:07.643
That is why we watch television.

375
00:22:07.726 --> 00:22:11.851
That is why we read books,
go to the movies or play video games.


376
00:22:12.018 --> 00:22:15.143
We want to see how we are represented.

377
00:22:16.101 --> 00:22:18.601
I think, looking at a world like this,

378
00:22:18.685 --> 00:22:20.476
it is about finding the met

379
00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:24.560
for, like, adolescence,
which is Ciri's journey in some cases,


380
00:22:24.685 --> 00:22:25.810
is, like: "My God!

381
00:22:25.893 --> 00:22:29.560
"I have all this magic power and I don’t
know what’s going on with my body".


382
00:22:29.643 --> 00:22:32.476
This is adolescence for many
people, men or women,


383
00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:35.893
And it’s about finding these touch
stones, where the fantastic


384
00:22:35.976 --> 00:22:38.935
is rooted in something that
everyone identifies with


385
00:22:39.018 --> 00:22:41.143
and have already experienced
it in your own life.

386
00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:45.060
Geralt was also an orphan as a child,

387
00:22:45.143 --> 00:22:47.768
So, I think it’s a
very transversal theme,


388
00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:53.726
people… being together,
having people around


389
00:22:53.810 --> 00:22:58.560
who like them and I think that’s
what they’re all looking for.


390
00:22:59.685 --> 00:23:04.101
What I like best about our
adaptation and what we are doing


391
00:23:04.685 --> 00:23:08.226
is that it is very centered
on emotions and relationships.


392
00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:10.768
I think it is just beautiful.

393
00:23:11.476 --> 00:23:16.310
And all these things are in the books
and they are very important in the books


394
00:23:16.393 --> 00:23:19.643
but I think we’re giving
them even more attention


395
00:23:19.726 --> 00:23:22.351
and bringing them to a different level.

396
00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:26.310
One of the great elements of this story,

397
00:23:26.393 --> 00:23:32.810
that Lauren and the incredible scriptwriters
kept, which I think is fantastic,


398
00:23:32.893 --> 00:23:36.935
because I think it’s a very important
part of this world, it’s the humor,


399
00:23:37.393 --> 00:23:42.351
There can be humor at times
amid destruction and darkness.


400
00:23:42.518 --> 00:23:44.851
Some humor always comes up.

401
00:23:45.435 --> 00:23:49.560
What I love about what Henry
brought to the character,


402
00:23:49.851 --> 00:23:52.976
and, in the end, that the screenwriters
brought to the whole work...


403
00:23:54.018 --> 00:23:57.560
It is almost… You can say it's
modern, but you can also say


404
00:23:57.643 --> 00:23:59.101
which is timeless humor.

405
00:23:59.185 --> 00:24:02.685
Why are you dressed like
a sad silk merchant?


406
00:24:03.185 --> 00:24:06.643
And also the way
Henry does humor,


407
00:24:07.726 --> 00:24:10.101
shows his mood,
because he has an easy laugh


408
00:24:10.185 --> 00:24:12.268
and it is really fun.

409
00:24:12.601 --> 00:24:16.351
Everyone loves a white knight,
but a white knight with a humor


410
00:24:16.435 --> 00:24:18.060
dry and slightly eccentric

411
00:24:18.976 --> 00:24:21.351
it is more pleasant
to see and to interpret.

412
00:24:21.435 --> 00:24:24.310
I saw Henry and Joey doing some scenes.

413
00:24:24.476 --> 00:24:27.226
And I think there’s a
little… I always say this,


414
00:24:27.310 --> 00:24:31.018
that there is a relationship
like Shrek's with Donkey.


415
00:24:31.101 --> 00:24:32.851
Come on, Geralt, tell me sincerely.

416
00:24:33.393 --> 00:24:35.226
What do you think of my voice?

417
00:24:37.976 --> 00:24:40.685
It is like ordering a pie and
finding out it has no filling.


418
00:24:41.310 --> 00:24:45.851
I remember receiving the <i>email,</i>

419
00:24:45.935 --> 00:24:49.893
and panic, because I realized

420
00:24:49.976 --> 00:24:52.851
how fantastic Jaskier's role was.

421
00:24:53.726 --> 00:24:56.226
My sister at that time asked:

422
00:24:56.601 --> 00:24:59.851
"How are you, what is going on?
There is something different about you".


423
00:24:59.935 --> 00:25:02.893
And I said, "Yeah".
Read about this character.


424
00:25:03.476 --> 00:25:07.643
And her response was, "Joey",
is this a dream that you are just having?


425
00:25:08.143 --> 00:25:10.601
Because this is so perfect.

426
00:25:10.685 --> 00:25:12.685
You have an incredible neck.

427
00:25:13.851 --> 00:25:15.851
Like a… sensual goose.

428
00:25:16.476 --> 00:25:19.810
And from,
during the hearing process,


429
00:25:19.893 --> 00:25:24.726
and getting the role,
everything was incredibly exciting,


430
00:25:24.810 --> 00:25:26.601
but strangely normal.

431
00:25:26.685 --> 00:25:29.518
This was supposed to happen.

432
00:25:30.476 --> 00:25:35.226
Every day has been an exploration
of that natural feeling,


433
00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:39.226
to feel at home and to find
and create a new family.


434
00:25:39.810 --> 00:25:41.768
Run, Geralt!  Heavens!

435
00:25:42.893 --> 00:25:43.726
Geralt!

436
00:25:43.976 --> 00:25:46.601
I had to get him out of the country.
I want what is due to me.


437
00:25:46.685 --> 00:25:50.476
<i>Throw a coin at your
Warlock Valley of Abundance</i>


438
00:25:53.351 --> 00:25:54.435
This song...

439
00:25:56.018 --> 00:25:58.893
… Was written by our
composers, Sonya and Giona…


440
00:25:59.810 --> 00:26:02.560
… Who made several different versions.

441
00:26:02.643 --> 00:26:05.226
Eventually, we realized that...

442
00:26:06.768 --> 00:26:13.560
… The song has a <i>folk</i> quality
that we want to get across


443
00:26:13.643 --> 00:26:15.810
all this land and that…

444
00:26:16.351 --> 00:26:19.560
... remember the folk
songs of ancient times.


445
00:26:19.685 --> 00:26:21.435
It has a certain Celtic flavor

446
00:26:21.643 --> 00:26:24.851
but it is also slightly
"eared" and <i>pop.</i>


447
00:26:24.935 --> 00:26:28.143
It is something fantastic that Jaskier brings

448
00:26:28.851 --> 00:26:31.935
to the Continent, and that the
songwriters bring to the series


449
00:26:32.018 --> 00:26:34.518
it is an exercise in public relations.

450
00:26:34.601 --> 00:26:36.560
He starts to invent this song

451
00:26:36.643 --> 00:26:40.101
and Geralt de Rivia
immediately notices something, and says...

452
00:26:40.185 --> 00:26:41.893
This is not how it happened.

453
00:26:42.726 --> 00:26:44.393
Didn't you have more respect?

454
00:26:46.726 --> 00:26:48.393
Respect does not make history.

455
00:26:49.393 --> 00:26:53.060
And I think he understands... people

456
00:26:53.726 --> 00:26:56.310
in a different way than Geralt's.

457
00:26:56.393 --> 00:26:59.060
He realizes that to make
progress in this world,


458
00:26:59.518 --> 00:27:02.185
sometimes it is necessary
to blur the limits a little.


459
00:27:02.851 --> 00:27:09.435
<i>Throw a coin at your
Warlock Valley of Abundance</i>


460
00:27:20.351 --> 00:27:22.685
There is immense action in the series,

461
00:27:22.768 --> 00:27:25.935
and to reflect the
diversity of the stories...


462
00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:30.518
We had a double coordinator to
supervise the entire season,


463
00:27:30.601 --> 00:27:31.435
Franklin Henson,

464
00:27:32.185 --> 00:27:34.185
who did a phenomenal job

465
00:27:35.143 --> 00:27:40.518
in the constant creation and management
of the action throughout the season,


466
00:27:41.310 --> 00:27:45.226
but to help reflect the diversity
of the different stories,


467
00:27:45.310 --> 00:27:46.893
we will also hire other people

468
00:27:46.976 --> 00:27:50.185
to bring different flavors to the action.

469
00:27:51.185 --> 00:27:53.810
We hire a fight coordinator,

470
00:27:54.435 --> 00:27:55.268
Wolfgang,

471
00:27:55.851 --> 00:27:57.435
who came to help us

472
00:27:57.976 --> 00:28:00.810
with some of the struggles we see
at the beginning of the season.


473
00:28:02.393 --> 00:28:03.518
Everything is impeccable.

474
00:28:05.726 --> 00:28:06.560
It is positive.

475
00:28:06.643 --> 00:28:09.935
The moment when Geralt comes across

476
00:28:10.601 --> 00:28:12.560
with some bandits from Renfri's gang

477
00:28:12.643 --> 00:28:16.060
it is interesting because there
was evidence of what Geralt can do,


478
00:28:16.143 --> 00:28:18.768
but at that time,
we haven’t seen it yet


479
00:28:19.185 --> 00:28:21.643
and here we have a Mexican
impasse, in this city,


480
00:28:21.726 --> 00:28:24.435
where he faces seven villains.

481
00:28:30.810 --> 00:28:31.893
And... cut, thanks.

482
00:28:34.810 --> 00:28:38.143
We are very lucky to
have Henry as our Geralt.


483
00:28:38.768 --> 00:28:42.851
He brings that quiet determination
and, of course, that natural strength,


484
00:28:42.935 --> 00:28:44.351
that he owns.

485
00:28:44.435 --> 00:28:48.143
He does his own stunts,
which is a producer's worst nightmare.


486
00:28:48.226 --> 00:28:51.143
If Geralt is in the
picture, then it is Henry


487
00:28:51.976 --> 00:28:54.310
and maybe maybe ten days of training

488
00:28:54.893 --> 00:28:59.268
to do those fights and it is interesting
because what the doubles team does


489
00:28:59.351 --> 00:29:01.976
is to take advantage of Henry's strengths.

490
00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:07.351
I mean, he is a person of
great size and strength and...


491
00:29:08.226 --> 00:29:11.976
… And it’s very interesting to be
able to use someone’s natural skills,


492
00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:14.143
everything seems much more credible.

493
00:29:14.268 --> 00:29:18.268
It’s about ten days of rehearsals for
a fight that takes two days to film,


494
00:29:18.726 --> 00:29:20.476
and that, on the screen, takes two minutes.

495
00:29:22.643 --> 00:29:26.101
And the idea is to have fantastic scenes

496
00:29:27.143 --> 00:29:29.060
that reflect the diversity of the stories.

497
00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:32.601
And I think it is exciting
to see an entire season


498
00:29:32.685 --> 00:29:35.351
and the action never looks the same.

499
00:29:35.476 --> 00:29:36.851
Everything is very different.

500
00:29:40.768 --> 00:29:44.226
A LOT MORE

501
00:29:44.310 --> 00:29:48.185
The stories of The Witcher touch
everything we experience today.


502
00:29:48.268 --> 00:29:50.601
The consequences of colonialism,

503
00:29:51.018 --> 00:29:53.810
the class disparity,
the rich and the poor,


504
00:29:53.976 --> 00:29:56.310
indigenous cultures to be fucked,

505
00:29:56.601 --> 00:29:58.518
racism, sexism.

506
00:29:58.976 --> 00:30:00.226
The world gone mad.

507
00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:02.143
People with power that they shouldn't have,

508
00:30:02.226 --> 00:30:05.435
people rioting, constant change.

509
00:30:05.518 --> 00:30:10.018
This world is a stormy ocean
and <i>The Witcher</i> is it.


510
00:30:12.393 --> 00:30:13.726
If I had to summarize,

511
00:30:13.810 --> 00:30:18.935
I would say that the theme that
tells me more is, more or less,


512
00:30:19.018 --> 00:30:20.851
the blurring of the
limits of Good and Evil.

513
00:30:20.935 --> 00:30:24.518
And my goal is for people to talk
about it after they see the series.


514
00:30:24.601 --> 00:30:27.351
We try very hard to make
sure that there isn’t exactly


515
00:30:27.435 --> 00:30:29.518
good or bad in our world.

516
00:30:29.810 --> 00:30:33.268
Starting to see the first episode,
the person we think is good,


517
00:30:33.351 --> 00:30:35.351
and looks like the hero
or hero in the story,

518
00:30:35.435 --> 00:30:37.560
in the end, we
may find it very different,

519
00:30:37.643 --> 00:30:40.601
because, suddenly,
we have a different perspective.


520
00:30:42.476 --> 00:30:45.226
But love is one
of the most present themes...

521
00:30:46.185 --> 00:30:47.101
… and…

522
00:30:48.018 --> 00:30:49.810
… Your power to change someone.

523
00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:55.976
Another thing that I find interesting
is that, as we go along, we all learn,


524
00:30:56.310 --> 00:30:57.518
in a way, what is...

525
00:30:58.018 --> 00:31:01.268
… The tone of the series and
who these characters are,


526
00:31:01.393 --> 00:31:04.810
and it’s interesting to continue
to develop that as we go along.


527
00:31:06.518 --> 00:31:10.226
Once again, I find it very exciting to see
the direction the series is going to take.


528
00:31:15.435 --> 00:31:16.726
It is a dream come true.

529
00:31:16.810 --> 00:31:20.393
Is those situations where
we fight for something


530
00:31:20.476 --> 00:31:24.435
so long, that we stop believing it
will happen and suddenly it happens.


531
00:31:24.518 --> 00:31:25.351
Excited?

532
00:31:25.435 --> 00:31:29.060
I am always. 
It is a great adventure.

533
00:31:29.518 --> 00:31:33.226
I wanted to introduce the world
to all three at the same time


534
00:31:33.310 --> 00:31:36.810
and allow each character
to blossom completely.


535
00:31:37.476 --> 00:31:40.435
And it is really
fun to follow each one

536
00:31:40.518 --> 00:31:44.143
and see that they need each other.
They really need a family.


537
00:31:46.893 --> 00:31:48.143
Above all,

538
00:31:48.226 --> 00:31:53.310
what role will Geralt,
Ciri and Yennefer play in this continent,


539
00:31:53.393 --> 00:31:57.435
who is at war, and
apparently, because of Ciri?


540
00:31:59.268 --> 00:32:01.601
There is much that is about to unfold.

541
00:32:02.685 --> 00:32:04.643
Stay with us, there's a lot to see.

542
00:32:13.268 --> 00:32:17.351
