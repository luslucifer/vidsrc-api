1
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.520
8,000 Nazi
personnel served here.


2
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.640
Auschwitz,

3
00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.760
the most comprehensively-designed
mass extermination concept


4
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.880
in the history of mankind.

5
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.280
- In 1944 came an order

6
00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.720
that we're going to be taking out

7
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.080
from the ghetto, and,

8
00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.600
they started sending transport
to take us to Auschwitz.


9
00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.680
And when we arrived,

10
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.280
men and boys separate a queue,

11
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.320
women and children, another queue.

12
00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.760
And we moved forward and,

13
00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.240
then we came to three
high-ranking officers.


14
00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.680
Mengele was one of them.

15
00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.280
And they ask you your age,

16
00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.040
looked at you, how fit you are.

17
00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.720
I was 14 then.

18
00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.440
And 180 of the children after 182

19
00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.640
went to their death,

20
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.440
to the gas chambers with other people.

21
00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.000
And then they gave us
the number on the arm.


22
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.960
We lost our name from
that day onwards, B-7608.


23
00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.800
Every prisoner in Auschwitz had a number.

24
00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.280
The Auschwitz camp complex

25
00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.680
covered several miles

26
00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.480
and consisted of Auschwitz I,

27
00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.800
which was the prisoner of war camp

28
00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.680
and the administrative headquarters.

29
00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.880
Monowitz, or Auschwitz III,

30
00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.760
which provided a slave labor force

31
00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.720
for the giant IG Farben chemical factory.

32
00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.280
There were also dozens of sub camps.

33
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.600
But the most notorious camp
of all was Auschwitz II,


34
00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.800
which became better known as Birkenau.

35
00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.000
The other purpose-built death camps were

36
00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.400
within Nazi-occupied Poland.

37
00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.600
But Auschwitz, although on
the soil of defeated Poland,


38
00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.960
was at the time within the borders

39
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.280
of the greater German Reich.

40
00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.720
- This is one of the
most important pictures


41
00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.080
from the Auschwitz album.

42
00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.680
It shows the moment of the selection.

43
00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.520
The spot from this picture

44
00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.440
is right there behind us,
the ramp, the platform.


45
00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.120
This is one of the SS doctors,

46
00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:07.280
conducting the selection.

47
00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.920
In front of him, group
of men waiting for that,


48
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.120
for the selection process.

49
00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.760
The one that stood
in front of the doctor,

50
00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.320
somebody old, you can see
that, cane, white hair.


51
00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.360
People that are old, babies, handicapped,

52
00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.680
almost all were sent to the gas chambers,

53
00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.080
killed straight away.

54
00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.960
They were taken this way,

55
00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.920
and they walked to
the end of the ramp.

56
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.360
It's this road, down there,
at the end of the tracks.


57
00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.880
There were two gas chambers
and crematoria, two and three.


58
00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.640
From the selection place
down there to the end,


59
00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.120
it was 10-minutes walk only.

60
00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.440
- So, this is where most of
the 1.1 million people walked.


61
00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:48.520
- Yeah.

62
00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.680
- Every day, we see trains arriving

63
00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.400
and we knew on the left-hand side,

64
00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:07.840
all the people were walking,
they went to gas chamber.


65
00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:09.360
There were four gas chambers

66
00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.680
and four crematoriums,
day and night working.


67
00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.360
- These are the
remains of the gas chamber

68
00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.120
and crematorium number two.

69
00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.560
They were underground, they
were all hidden, the rooms.


70
00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.680
Germans did on purpose, of course.

71
00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.560
There was thousands of
people select to die


72
00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.960
and they all had to strip.

73
00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:35.240
There were hangers on the
walls, there were benches,


74
00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.000
so they were told to leave
their stuff together.


75
00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:42.440
- A few hundred people went
into a gas chamber, and then,


76
00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:48.440
they shut the gate on the,
it was all underground, and,


77
00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.680
SS men, gas masked,

78
00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:57.760
put the gas in and within
about 15 minutes or 10 minutes,


79
00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:59.360
they were all dead.

80
00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:03.336
- They were told that
they're gonna have showers.


81
00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.320
They could see even the
shower heads in that room.


82
00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.440
The shower heads, of course, were fake.

83
00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.560
That room was used as the gas chamber.

84
00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:12.120
To kill 2000 people,

85
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.280
it used to take about 20 minutes,

86
00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.880
using for that, of course, the Zyklon B.

87
00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.520
Women, kids, men, in that one room

88
00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.680
that had only 210 square
meters of surface.


89
00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:25.080
People were like cattle squeezed together.

90
00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:26.216
It was a very painful death.

91
00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:29.240
They were vomiting, choking, suffocating.

92
00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.480
After they were killed,
after they were murdered,


93
00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.000
the gas chamber had to
be ventilated first.


94
00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:36.080
When this was done,

95
00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.880
the members of the
Sonderkommando had to go there.


96
00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:40.920
They were given orders
to clear the gas chamber.


97
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.480
They had to take the bodies out.

98
00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:43.736
But the members of the Sonderkommando

99
00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:45.440
were not collaborating with the general.

100
00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:47.280
They were the prisoners of Auschwitz,

101
00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:48.920
forced to do that job.

102
00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.800
Among them, there were many Jews.

103
00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:54.480
So when they were sent
to the gas chambers,


104
00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.880
many of them have found
people that they knew.


105
00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.040
They have found bodies of their friends,

106
00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.040
cousins, sisters, brothers.

107
00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:05.640
They had to take their bodies
out to the crematorium.


108
00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:08.520
And then of course,
first, if they had found,


109
00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.336
they had to take off the
jewelry from the bodies,


110
00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:13.440
rings, necklaces, they had
to extract the gold teeth.


111
00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.800
They shaved the head
from the women's heads


112
00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:18.720
and then they started burning the corpses.

113
00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.600
It was like a factory.

114
00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:25.680
Well organized, very systematic
way of killing people.


115
00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:36.880
This is one of the ponds
for the human ashes, David.


116
00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:40.800
And the ponds like this one

117
00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:43.480
were also next to the other gas chambers.

118
00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:44.936
Next to the gas chamber number two,

119
00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:46.480
next to the gas chamber three.

120
00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:50.360
Not always they dump
the ashes to the ponds.


121
00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:52.800
Sometimes they just put
the ashes on the tracks


122
00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:54.640
and dump them to the rivers.

123
00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:58.520
Next to Auschwitz, we have two
big rivers, Sola and Vistula.


124
00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:02.120
- So here are the remains

125
00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:04.760
of literally tens of thousands of people.

126
00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:07.600
Yes, of course.

127
00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:17.080
- Eventually I was chosen
to work on agriculture,


128
00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:18.560
with two horses.

129
00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:23.000
For fertilizer, they used
to bring us sacks from the,


130
00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:26.240
gas chambers,

131
00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:28.960
burned the bones.

132
00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:32.360
And I used to put my hand in

133
00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:33.880
and threw it on the floor.

134
00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:37.160
I could feel the bones in my hand.

135
00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:48.720
- Around you, you see now the remains

136
00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:52.640
of some of the warehouses
they called Canada.


137
00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:54.680
So this is where the jail was kept.

138
00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:58.880
Shoes, suitcases, thousands
of personal belongings


139
00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:02.040
the Jews were bringing
with them to the camp.


140
00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:06.000
So those things that were in
a good condition were sent


141
00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:08.800
to Germany to the Reich
and they were reused.


142
00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:12.520
Random prisoners were
picked to do this job.


143
00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:16.800
- This part of Auschwitz-Birkenau
was called Canada,


144
00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:19.560
simply because the prisoners had heard

145
00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:22.120
that Canada was a nice place to live.

146
00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:29.520
- I came to Canada in, I
think it was April, 1944,


147
00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:32.120
just as this thing was built, in fact,

148
00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:34.520
all these huts were completely new.

149
00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:38.440
My hut was the first hut here.

150
00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:40.920
And so there were two huts

151
00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.440
because were a day shift
at the night shift,


152
00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:45.600
and there were 800 of us.

153
00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:49.080
So we were accommodated in these two huts.

154
00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:51.480
And down here were the men.

155
00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:54.120
The men's duty was to bring the stuff

156
00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:56.520
from the train to Canada.

157
00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:58.200
Let me just show you,

158
00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:01.280
'cause that's a useful thing to see.

159
00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:05.760
Here, you see people disembarking
from the train, okay?


160
00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:07.680
Some with the bundles, as you can see.

161
00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:09.760
So some people are carrying the bundles.

162
00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:12.240
So they were told to
leave everything behind.


163
00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:14.840
That luggage was brought by these men

164
00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:18.080
of the Canada commando,

165
00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:21.000
and that was then brought to Canada,

166
00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:22.760
where we did the sorting.

167
00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:24.480
- So most of
the people coming in here

168
00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:26.880
will not have known what
was gonna happen to them.


169
00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:29.760
- People had no conception whatsoever.

170
00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:31.680
People walking into a building

171
00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:34.120
of the gas chamber had no idea

172
00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:35.520
that it was a gas chamber.

173
00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:37.560
It said to disinfection.

174
00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:39.280
He said, 'You're going to be disinfected.

175
00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:41.720
"Please put your clothes together,

176
00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:44.960
"bundle your shoes together
so they don't get lost."


177
00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:48.200
That's what these men of
the Canada were supposed


178
00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:49.800
to tell the people.

179
00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:51.000
And they had to tell them

180
00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:52.880
because the SS here were standing,

181
00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:54.720
waiting for them to say that.

182
00:10:56.040 --> 00:11:00.600
That's one of the Canada
group, sorting shoes.


183
00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:03.920
That shows you how many shoes they wear.

184
00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.280
That particular hut was full of shoes

185
00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:09.680
from the bottom to the ceiling.

186
00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:12.840
And that's the overflow of
the shoes that are outside.


187
00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:15.040
- So this must be 10,000,

188
00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:16.400
at least there...
- Thousands.


189
00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:19.160
And then, for years
and years after the war,


190
00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:21.080
there were Germans wearing...
- Yeah.


191
00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:22.680
- Dead Jew's shoes.
- Absolutely.


192
00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:25.520
- Murdered Jew's shoes.
- Absolutely.


193
00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:29.400
When I was actually first
transferred to Canada,


194
00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:34.080
one of the SS officers, I think
it was a man called Pallage,


195
00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:37.760
he just made a very
short speech and he said,


196
00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:42.360
"Remember what you're
going to witness here.


197
00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:44.360
"And because you are witnesses,

198
00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:47.520
"you'll never be transferred
back to the main camp.


199
00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:50.280
"There's only one way out of here,

200
00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:52.440
"and that's through the chimney."

201
00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:55.960
So that, you can
imagine, was a big shock.

202
00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:57.720
That's how I got to Canada.

203
00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:03.880
- The ones that worked here,

204
00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:06.320
the prisoners sorting the belongings,

205
00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:10.360
were aware that just behind
the fence on the other side,


206
00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:12.200
the Germans were killing those people.

207
00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:14.760
The thousands of the
Jews were coming here,


208
00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:17.360
there were two other gas
chambers just behind the fence.


209
00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:19.480
And those that survived Auschwitz

210
00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:22.440
and worked here in the Canada warehouses,

211
00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:26.360
they remember that they have
seen people in the woods,


212
00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:29.680
down there waiting
before they were killed.


213
00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:31.920
This was a very organized,

214
00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.600
very systematic way of killing people,

215
00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:37.080
on the industrial scale.

216
00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:45.520
- There were three cordons of
assessment guarding Auschwitz.


217
00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:48.320
They actually volunteered for the job.

218
00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:50.480
They were very cruel.

219
00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:55.680
And then they went home
to see their families.


220
00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:00.040
They had a good time at
home, and had children.


221
00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:03.680
And then they came back to Auschwitz

222
00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:05.720
and did the same thing again.

223
00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:12.360
- In 1944, at the height

224
00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:15.120
of Auschwitz
-Birkenau's mass murders,

225
00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:18.600
the Nazis compiled two
contrasting photo albums.


226
00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:24.320
One, of the new arrivals
at the death camp,


227
00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:29.400
the other of the holiday camp,

228
00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:31.760
for officers, guards, administrators,

229
00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:34.560
and other Auschwitz complex personnel

230
00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:37.280
to relax and enjoy themselves.

231
00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:41.640
In one album,

232
00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:44.360
most of the people
photographed would be murdered.


233
00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:04.080
In the other album,

234
00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:06.240
most of the people photographed

235
00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:08.240
would get away with those murders.

236
00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:30.320
By May, 1944, they were
killing 10,000 people a day.


237
00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:33.880
The Nazis murdered 1.1 million men, women,

238
00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:36.320
and children in the Auschwitz complex.

239
00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:44.920
Approximately 7,000 of
the butchers responsible,


240
00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.760
mainly SS, survived the war,

241
00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:52.840
yet only around 800 were ever
prosecuted for war crimes.


242
00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:00.360
Josef Mengele, arguably the world's

243
00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:04.560
most wanted Nazi war criminal,
targeted twins, Gypsies,


244
00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:06.760
and dwarfs in particular in Auschwitz.

245
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.560
One of his many horrific experiments

246
00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:13.120
was injecting eyeballs with a dye

247
00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:14.800
to try to change the color.

248
00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:30.280
This memorial in Mengele's hometown reads,

249
00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:33.040
"No one can divorce himself

250
00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:34.720
"from the history of his people.

251
00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:39.520
"One should not and must
not let history rest


252
00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:42.040
"because otherwise it can rise again

253
00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:43.840
"and become part of the present."

254
00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:50.120
- Josef Mengele, the "Angel of Death,"

255
00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:51.800
was born and grew up here

256
00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:54.320
and his father was the largest employer.

257
00:15:55.240 --> 00:16:00.000
And in 1956 when he was
living in Argentina,


258
00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:03.120
he was able to
go to the German embassy

259
00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:06.560
and get hold of a copy
of his birth certificate.


260
00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:11.320
And from that, he was able to
obtain an Argentinian passport


261
00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:13.480
in the name of Josef Mengele.

262
00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:17.840
And then allegedly, later that year,

263
00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:22.320
he flew to Switzerland and
met with his wife and son,


264
00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:25.320
and from there, sneaked
back here to Günzburg


265
00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:27.320
to see all his family and friends.

266
00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:31.280
And then in 1959, when his father died,

267
00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:34.160
he again came back here and was involved

268
00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:37.080
in the wake and the
funeral, and apparently,


269
00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:41.200
most of the town knew he was
here, all except the police.


270
00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:43.760
And even more extraordinarily,

271
00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:46.920
he actually stayed with some nuns.

272
00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:56.160
Mengele
avoided extradition requests


273
00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:58.080
by the West German government

274
00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:01.080
and escaped the Mossad
attempt to capture him.


275
00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:04.720
In 1979, he died, aged 67,

276
00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:08.960
after suffering a stroke
while swimming in Brazil.


277
00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:11.880
His skeleton is stored at the

278
00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:15.360
Sao Paulo Institute for Forensic Medicine,

279
00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:18.560
where it is used for medical experiments.

280
00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:46.600
- Six million Jews were
murdered in the Holocaust.


281
00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:52.440
It's hard to comprehend

282
00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:55.560
what six million people
actually looks like.


283
00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:58.800
I can only try to compare
it to my own understanding.


284
00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:07.000
I come from Yorkshire, which
is the UK's largest county.


285
00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:10.760
It takes two hours to
drive north to south,


286
00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:14.760
and two and a half hours
to drive east to west.


287
00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:22.880
There are over 1,100 cities,
towns, villages, and hamlets.


288
00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:29.360
Some, like adjoining
cities Leeds and Bradford,


289
00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:31.640
has 1.4 million living there.

290
00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:37.840
Sheffield has 600,000 inhabitants.

291
00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:41.400
In total, the population of Yorkshire

292
00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:44.520
is currently 5.4 million people.

293
00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:49.520
If the Nazis had exterminated

294
00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:51.800
the entire population of Yorkshire,

295
00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:54.080
what would the British
government have done?


296
00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:59.240
There are six million people living

297
00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:01.080
in the US State of Maryland.

298
00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:04.480
If they'd all been massacred by the Nazis,

299
00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:06.800
what would the American
government have done?


300
00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:10.520
What would the world have done

301
00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:13.520
if the almost six million
people living in Denmark


302
00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:15.480
had all been murdered by the Nazis?

303
00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:24.680
At school in the 1960s,
just 35 miles from here,


304
00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:26.560
we were told that we British

305
00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:28.760
could never have carried
out the Holocaust.


306
00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:31.640
We are civilized and above such things.

307
00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:36.120
On the 16th of March, 1190,

308
00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:39.800
following many weeks of
antisemitic riots, 150 Jews,


309
00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:42.640
the entire Jewish population of York,

310
00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:45.600
were massacred, many by their own hands,

311
00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:48.000
at a former castle on this site.

312
00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:49.680
Had more Jews lived here,

313
00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:52.080
they too would have been massacred.

314
00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:54.880
Regardless of the actual numbers involved,

315
00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:57.400
that was mass extermination.

316
00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:04.160
In 1290, Edward I expelled
all Jews from his kingdom


317
00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:09.720
and Jews were only permitted
to return 367 years later


318
00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:12.600
when Oliver Cromwell allowed them back.

319
00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:16.800
In the last 2000 years,

320
00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:18.480
at one time or another,

321
00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:20.480
in most European countries,

322
00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:23.720
the Jews have been
relentlessly persecuted.


323
00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:36.120
The government sent a few

324
00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:39.440
of us congressmen over to see those camps.

325
00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:41.280
And if there's anybody left who wonders

326
00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:43.440
if this war was worth fighting,

327
00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:45.960
well, I wish they could have been along.

328
00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:50.160
There it was, right in front of us,

329
00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:52.640
fascism and what it's bound to lead to,

330
00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:54.200
wherever it crops up.

331
00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.840
In Germany, it led to over

332
00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:04.440
It was the worst thing
I ever saw in my life.


333
00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:13.560
- The shock of seeing

334
00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:17.360
can never be taken away,

335
00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:21.880
but is a fact that
publicly and officially,


336
00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:26.960
the Allies condemned what
we now call the Holocaust,


337
00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:30.240
and what they then just call
the extermination of the Jews,


338
00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:32.880
as early as the time of
the Battle of Stalingrad,


339
00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:35.560
in the winter of 1942.

340
00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:40.200
And the exiled refugee
governments in London


341
00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:43.200
brought up the first set of principles

342
00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:45.520
to punish the Nazis for war crimes.

343
00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:47.640
And the Soviet authorities have been

344
00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:51.600
publishing detailed
descriptions of Nazi crimes,


345
00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:54.400
including pogroms, as they called them,

346
00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:57.600
very early in the war,
and not just in the press,


347
00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:00.080
but in official statements.

348
00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:03.360
This Allied statement about
the extermination of the Jews


349
00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:05.280
was read out in the House of Commons

350
00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:07.560
and there was a memorial,

351
00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:10.040
a moment when Parliament stood in silence,

352
00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:12.360
which it never did, except
for the death of a king.


353
00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:14.000
It was a ceremonial moment.

354
00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:18.840
And this was broadcast on
some 20 languages on the BBC.


355
00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:23.680
I regret
to have to inform the House


356
00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:26.240
that reliable reports
have recently reached


357
00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:28.040
His Majesty's Government

358
00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:31.280
regarding the barbarous
and inhuman treatment


359
00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:34.680
to which Jews are being subjected
in German-occupied Europe.


360
00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:40.560
German authorities, not
content with denying


361
00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:43.240
to persons of Jewish race
in all the territories


362
00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:46.520
over which their barbarous
rule has been extended


363
00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:49.560
the most elementary human rights,

364
00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:54.040
are now carrying into effect
Hitler's oft repeated intention


365
00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:56.960
to exterminate the
Jewish people in Europe.


366
00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:01.440
From all the occupied countries,

367
00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:04.200
Jews are being transported in conditions

368
00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:08.360
of appalling horror and
brutality to Eastern Europe.


369
00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:14.400
The infirm are left to die
of exposure and starvation,


370
00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:19.160
or are deliberately
massacred in mass executions.


371
00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:23.640
The number of victims of these
bloody cruelties is reckoned


372
00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:25.960
in many hundreds of thousands

373
00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:29.800
of entirely innocent
men, women, and children.


374
00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:39.080
Just months after he
made that historic statement,


375
00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:40.880
Anthony Eden received a request

376
00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:42.400
from the Bulgarian authorities

377
00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:47.280
for help with moving 11,343 Jews

378
00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:50.000
from the newly-acquired
Bulgarian territories


379
00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:52.480
of Greece and Yugoslavia

380
00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:54.520
to British-controlled Palestine.

381
00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:57.320
He refused.

382
00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:00.600
Many of those Jews ended up instead

383
00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:03.360
in the Treblinka extermination camp.

384
00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:07.400
- United Nations War Crimes Commission

385
00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:10.200
started work at the end of 1943,

386
00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:11.640
at the height of the war,

387
00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:14.360
and began compiling dossiers of evidence

388
00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:18.200
against Nazi and Japanese war criminals.

389
00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:21.920
And then just after the Nazis' surrender,

390
00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:27.040
the four victorious powers
in Europe came together,


391
00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:29.080
not before time, many would say,

392
00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:32.440
and agreed on a legal process

393
00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:37.240
to try the Nazi leadership
for the crimes they committed.


394
00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:41.640
And this agreement, this charter
then was the legal document


395
00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:43.760
under which the top Nazis were brought

396
00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:45.360
to account at Nuremberg.

397
00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:53.120
Johann Robert
Riss was a Wehrmacht sergeant


398
00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:57.840
involved in the massacre of
approximately 184 civilians


399
00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:00.960
in a Tuscan town in 1944.

400
00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:04.160
Living in Bavaria after the war,

401
00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:08.240
in 2011, he was sentenced in absentia,

402
00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:11.880
by the military court in
Rome, to life imprisonment.


403
00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:15.600
Germany declined to extradite him.

404
00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:21.200
To date, he appears to be
at liberty and unpunished.


405
00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:25.400
- Churchill, Roosevelt,

406
00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:27.200
and after him, Truman,

407
00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:29.320
were all very supportive of trials.

408
00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:31.440
However, within governments,

409
00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:33.760
there was a certain amount of hostility.

410
00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:35.560
And we know from records

411
00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:38.440
that have been subsequently
unearthed and published


412
00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:40.480
that in Britain, for example,

413
00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:45.360
a number of senior civil
servants were opposed to trials.


414
00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:48.480
Some described it as victor's justice,

415
00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:51.120
others said it would be counterproductive

416
00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:53.520
and it would push Germany into the hands

417
00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:55.680
of a another would-be Hitler.

418
00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:59.560
And in the US, the objections
were slightly different.


419
00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:01.520
But there was certainly a pattern

420
00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:04.160
among a number of senior people

421
00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:06.720
within government to resist the trials.

422
00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:09.760
And it was only overcome
by the top leadership.


423
00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:13.200
- Henry Stimson managed the war effort

424
00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:16.160
for Franklin Roosevelt,
the Secretary of War.


425
00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:21.240
His own history on war crimes
goes back decades before


426
00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:26.040
when he was part of the American
team supporting the idea


427
00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:29.520
that a war was itself a crime.

428
00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:33.000
So he was very keen on
prosecuting the Nazis


429
00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:34.640
for crimes of aggression.

430
00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:38.400
But he was also, in another way,

431
00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:41.520
strongly opposed to the idea
of crimes against humanity.


432
00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:44.200
Because as Stimson told his staff,

433
00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:47.440
he didn't want to
see America in the dock

434
00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:51.360
for the lynchings in the south of Blacks,

435
00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:54.440
because they had, as America supported,

436
00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:57.120
the idea that Germany could be prosecuted

437
00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:59.800
for what it had done to
its own citizens, the Jews.


438
00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:03.800
And this sense that you had
to preserve state sovereignty


439
00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:06.440
against outside's
interference was something


440
00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:08.480
that also he was very strong on.

441
00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:10.840
On the other hand, you
had Ambassador Pell,


442
00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:13.520
who is a real hero of these issues.

443
00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:18.520
He went public back in Washington
and created a huge fuss


444
00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:23.040
and forced the State
Department through the press


445
00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:26.760
to agree that German
crimes against German Jews


446
00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:28.680
should be regarded as a crime.

447
00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:31.360
And when Pell headed off to Europe,

448
00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:34.080
he penned a note to a friend saying,

449
00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:36.600
"We want to make sure
after this is all over


450
00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:40.160
"that the Gestapo officers
can't sit around in the village,


451
00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:42.600
"having a renaissance
and talking of the joys


452
00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:44.880
"of shooting Jews and looting France."

453
00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:47.400
And he says explicitly, "We must make sure

454
00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:50.560
"that the Nazis do not
get a romantic revival,


455
00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:53.040
"the way in which the Confederacy managed

456
00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:56.160
"to do in America after the Civil War."

457
00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:59.960
A very telling point to be
written in 1943, I think.


458
00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:04.280
As well as Nuremberg,

459
00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:06.600
there seemed to be so
many other trials focusing


460
00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:09.040
upon the murderous crimes of the Holocaust

461
00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:10.800
that it looked as if the Allies

462
00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:13.800
in both East and West
Germany were truly determined


463
00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:16.680
to achieve real justice
for all the victims


464
00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:17.760
of mass slaughter.

465
00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:21.720
But an estimation of the immense number

466
00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:24.000
of perpetrators compared to those

467
00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:26.480
who actually stood trial exposes

468
00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:29.040
the minuscule tip of an iceberg.

469
00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:36.000
- People hold up Nuremberg
as a shining light


470
00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:37.960
of justice, quite rightly.

471
00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:41.400
And on the other hand, you
get arguments, "Oh, well,


472
00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:44.440
"Let's be pragmatic.

473
00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:46.880
"It's too difficult, it's too costly.

474
00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:49.520
"These people might become our friends."

475
00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:52.000
Well, I think what one should remember

476
00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:54.840
is the pragmatists almost succeeded

477
00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:57.560
in preventing Nuremberg
from ever happening.


478
00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:14.640
- On Thursday the 18th of
October, 1945 in Berlin,


479
00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:19.240
the indictment was lodged with a tribunal.

480
00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:25.000
And a copy of that indictment
in the German language


481
00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:27.600
has been furnished to each defendant

482
00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.280
and has been in his
possession more than 30 days.


483
00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:36.760
The defendants

484
00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:39.040
are to plead guilty

485
00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:44.120
or not guilty for the
charges against them.


486
00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:47.480
You must plead guilty or not guilty.

487
00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:18.440
- We're entering Courtroom 600.

488
00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:25.320
So this was the side
where the judges were.


489
00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:30.200
There were eight judges,
two of every country.


490
00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:33.600
Here's the place where
the translators sat.


491
00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:37.080
This is the place where
the defendants sat,


492
00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:40.400
and this is the place where
the defense councils were.


493
00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:43.680
And here where the tables

494
00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:46.680
where the prosecution teams had its place.

495
00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:50.400
The most basic Nuremberg principle is

496
00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:53.880
that such severe crimes
as these mass crimes,


497
00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:57.920
state crimes, crimes against
humanity, war crimes,


498
00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:59.880
must not be unpunished

499
00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:03.280
but must be tried before

500
00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:06.760
an international or a national court

501
00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:11.160
in order to document and
portray these crimes,


502
00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:13.840
but also, in order to satisfy

503
00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:18.480
the needs of the victims
for a certain punishment


504
00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:20.920
of those guilty of these crimes.

505
00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:24.000
There were 21 defendants.

506
00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:27.480
Originally there were 24,
but one killed itself.


507
00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:30.160
One, they could not find,
it was then later clear


508
00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:32.160
that he was also already dead.

509
00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:35.040
And one was not capable
to follow the trial


510
00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:37.120
because he was very ill.

511
00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:39.200
It is much, much
more than a show trial,

512
00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:44.280
especially the International
Military Tribunal detailed,


513
00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:47.520
portrayed the crime
history of Nazi Germany


514
00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:49.120
for the first time.

515
00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:52.120
The tribunal collected evidences,

516
00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:55.480
documents that still are very important

517
00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:57.240
for the research that is done

518
00:31:57.320 --> 00:32:00.920
on the so-called Das Dritte
Reich, the Third Reich.


519
00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:06.000
And the guilt, the individual
guilt of the accused was very,


520
00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:09.920
very meticulously proven.

521
00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:14.000
When the first trial, 21 were tried,

522
00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:18.760
12 were sentenced to death,
and three were acquitted.


523
00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:21.600
And the others, they got long-term

524
00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:23.720
or even lifetime imprisonments.

525
00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:25.880
The idea behind the Nuremberg

526
00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:32.360
trials was to put to try
the major war criminals,


527
00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:37.920
not people who were on the lower hierarchy

528
00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.920
in the Nazi regime, but
those who were responsible


529
00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.200
for the organization, for the planning,

530
00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:47.240
and those who benefited most
from this criminal system.


531
00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:52.880
Feodor Fedorenko served

532
00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:55.880
at Treblinka extermination camp.

533
00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:58.720
He escaped to the USA in 1949

534
00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:01.040
and became an American citizen.

535
00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:02.640
He retired to Florida,

536
00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:07.280
with its large Jewish population, in 1973.

537
00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:12.240
In December, 1984, 
Fedorenko became

538
00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:15.960
the first Nazi war
criminal living in the USA


539
00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:18.960
to be deported to the Soviet Union.

540
00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:21.520
At his trial in 1986,

541
00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:23.720
he was found guilty of treason

542
00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:26.640
and taking part in mass executions.

543
00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:31.680
He was executed by firing
squad in 1987, aged 79.


544
00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:46.960
Even though this
filming is taking place


545
00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:49.040
75 years after the end of the war,

546
00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:53.000
I was surprised to have the
opportunity to speak to someone


547
00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:55.760
who'd actually prosecuted
the Nazis at Nuremberg.


548
00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:01.960
- You're now going to
hear the presentation


549
00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:03.600
by the prosecution.

550
00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:05.560
- It is with sorrow and with hope.

551
00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:08.400
- This was the tragic fulfillment

552
00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:13.440
of a program of intolerance and arrogance.

553
00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:18.440
Vengeance is not our goal, nor do...

554
00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:21.840
Benjamin Ferencz is
the last living participant


555
00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:25.600
to give an eyewitness testimony
of those historic trials.


556
00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:29.000
- The slaughter permitted
by these defendants


557
00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:33.600
was dictated, not by military necessity,

558
00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:37.920
but by that supreme
perversion of thoughtful,


559
00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.800
the Nazi theory of the master race.

560
00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:46.240
- The International Military
Tribunal was the only one


561
00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:50.280
where the four occupying
powers and successful powers,


562
00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:54.480
United States, Great Britain,
France, and Soviet Union,


563
00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:59.560
joined together in response to
promises which had been made


564
00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:02.840
by President Roosevelt and Mr. Churchill,

565
00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:07.400
that the criminals would
be brought to justice.


566
00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:09.960
And that attracted a
great deal of attention


567
00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:11.520
and great many reporters.

568
00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:14.400
When that trial was over,
the reporters went home.


569
00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:16.080
The United States had decided

570
00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:19.200
that it would conduct
another series of trials,


571
00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:21.480
it turned out to be 12 trials,

572
00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:24.440
in order to give a more
comprehensive picture


573
00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:27.080
of what had happened, not just a snapshot,

574
00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:30.480
which was the IMT trial itself,

575
00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:32.040
but to explain how it is

576
00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:34.280
that a civilized country like Germany

577
00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:38.080
could not only tolerate
this type of atrocity,


578
00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:40.360
which the Nazis were committing,

579
00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:42.320
but would accept it and support it.

580
00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:45.680
- Over and over again,

581
00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:49.520
Hitler asserted his belief
in the necessity of force


582
00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:52.200
as the means of solving
international problems.


583
00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:54.240
- Just as the international military trial

584
00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:57.760
was coming to an end, I
was invited, I would say,


585
00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:00.880
by the Pentagon to
go back and join them

586
00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:04.480
for the trials which
the army was conducting,


587
00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:06.440
the military commission trials.

588
00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:09.800
I went over to see Telford Taylor.

589
00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:11.720
He had been asked by the president

590
00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:14.240
to set up 12 additional trials.

591
00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:18.120
And my first assignment
from Telford Taylor was,


592
00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:22.120
he said, "Look, we have
a number of suspects.


593
00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:24.080
"We are holding them in detention.

594
00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:27.920
"We need the evidence, because
if you have the suspect


595
00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.680
"and no evidence, you've got nothing.

596
00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:31.680
"And you've got the
evidence and no suspect,


597
00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:32.680
"you've got nothing.

598
00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:34.640
"So we've gotta match together,

599
00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:40.000
"proof of crime and the
criminal in custody.


600
00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:42.320
"And you provide the evidence for it,

601
00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:45.120
"that'll be your job, okay?"

602
00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:48.120
So I proceeded to
Berlin to do that job.

603
00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:50.400
I had a staff of about 50 people,

604
00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:53.280
mostly former German refugees.

605
00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:56.880
Had to speak German perfectly, of course.

606
00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:59.040
And one day,

607
00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:02.200
one of my assistants walks in

608
00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:04.600
and he hands me a pile
of papers and he said,


609
00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:06.000
"Look what I found."

610
00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:09.160
And I looked at him.

611
00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:13.000
The title on it was

612
00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:16.920
In German is, "Situation Reports,"

613
00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:21.480
of a certain group
known as Einsatzgruppen.


614
00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:24.520
Their assignment was to murder.

615
00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:26.720
They never used the word "murder."

616
00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:30.240
To eliminate all Jews,

617
00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:32.360
men, women, and children,

618
00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:34.560
without pity or remorse,

619
00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:37.040
to just exterminate them

620
00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:39.560
as you would exterminate vermin.

621
00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:41.280
That was the assignment

622
00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:45.760
of the SS Einsatzgruppen action group

623
00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:49.440
and the four divisions
that they had within them.


624
00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:52.320
And that's the job they carried out.

625
00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:56.040
So I sat down with a
little adding machine,


626
00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:57.720
I began to add them up.

627
00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:01.360
When I reached a million people murdered,

628
00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:04.560
I said, "That's enough."

629
00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:07.800
I took a sample, I took
the next military plane


630
00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:10.960
from Berlin back to Nuremberg.

631
00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:13.480
I met then with Telford Taylor.

632
00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:17.520
I said, "General, we have
to put on a new trial."


633
00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:18.960
He said, "We can't.

634
00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:21.360
"We have already assigned all the lawyers.

635
00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:25.440
"The Pentagon has already
approved the budget.


636
00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:29.200
"They're not inclined to
allow any new trials to go on


637
00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:32.040
"and we just can't do it."

638
00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:35.280
Whereabout I blew my cool and I said,

639
00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:37.320
"You've gotta put these people on trial!

640
00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:39.560
"I have in my hand mass murder,

641
00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:42.080
"mass murder on an unparalleled scale.

642
00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:46.640
"We just can't let these people go."

643
00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:51.720
And so I guess he noticed
my desperation or something.


644
00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:53.360
He said, "Well, can you do it

645
00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:55.520
"in addition to your other work?"

646
00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:57.080
And I said, "Sure."

647
00:38:57.160 --> 00:38:59.120
He said, "Okay, you do it."

648
00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:02.800
And so I was appointed by him

649
00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:05.160
as the Chief Prosecutor

650
00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:08.760
and what was later known as
the Einsatzgruppen Trial.


651
00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:11.440
- Genocide, the extermination

652
00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:14.360
of whole categories of human beings,

653
00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:19.320
as a foremost instrument
of the Nazi doctrines.


654
00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:22.440
It is therefore holy
fitting for this court


655
00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:25.920
to hear these charges
of international crimes


656
00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:29.360
and to adjudge them in
the name of civilization.


657
00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:33.200
The charges we have brought
accuse the defendants


658
00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:36.040
of having committed
crimes against humanity.


659
00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:41.080
- I rested my case in two days.

660
00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:42.960
Quite remarkable.

661
00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:45.720
Very simple, because I said, "Look,

662
00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:49.880
"I have the evidence here,
top secret German evidence.


663
00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:53.280
"I have the defendant there
whose name is on this report.


664
00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:55.560
"He was the commander-in-chief there,

665
00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:59.640
"and this is the total
reports he sent in."


666
00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:04.000
When I asked Ohlendorf, for
example, with my lead defendant,


667
00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:10.320
"Do you acknowledge that your
unit killed 90,000 Jews?"


668
00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:12.200
He said, "No."

669
00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:13.480
I said, "What do you mean, no?

670
00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:14.880
"Is that your signature?"

671
00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:16.480
"Yes."

672
00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:17.400
"Is it 90,000?"

673
00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:18.240
"Yes."

674
00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:19.680
"So how do you say no?"

675
00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:24.200
"Well, some of the men used
to brag about the body count.


676
00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:25.856
"They wanted to show they killed even more

677
00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:27.840
"than they actually killed."

678
00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:30.400
So I said, "Well, would
you say it's 70,000,


679
00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:32.520
"80,000 would be more appropriate?"

680
00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:34.360
"Yeah, yeah, that could be."

681
00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:41.840
And this was Dr. Otto
Ohlendorf, well educated man.


682
00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:45.200
All of my defendants had either
doctor degrees or high rank.


683
00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:46.880
I selected very carefully.

684
00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:50.280
How do you
plead to this indictment?


685
00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:51.680
Guilty or not guilty?

686
00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:03.400
They put
forward as their defense


687
00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:05.720
that they were only obeying orders.

688
00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:10.320
Another one was that the
documents were fabricated.


689
00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:13.000
And then some of them even actually went

690
00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:16.320
as far as to say they weren't aware

691
00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:19.120
that these mass murders were taking place.

692
00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:22.480
- Well, let's take a all
those excuses one at a time.


693
00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:24.960
One, superior orders, right?

694
00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:30.360
Every German soldier had
to carry his own book,


695
00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:33.920
they call a little book
manual of his duties.


696
00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:38.640
I had some of
'em, it listed the duties.

697
00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:41.560
"You are to obey all legal orders."

698
00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:45.360
Legal orders, it didn't say all orders,

699
00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:47.720
including illegal orders.

700
00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:51.120
I asked a question, "Did
they think it was legal


701
00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:53.080
"to murder thousands of children?"

702
00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:55.680
By what stretch of the imagination could

703
00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:57.200
that possibly be legal?

704
00:41:57.280 --> 00:42:00.520
The next argument they came up with,

705
00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:02.560
we didn't do it, of course.

706
00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:05.640
Well, that was refuted by their evidence.

707
00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:09.000
These were secret reports
which they had signed


708
00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:10.440
and sent to their headquarters.

709
00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:12.400
They're not gonna lie
to their headquarters


710
00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:14.160
about what they did,

711
00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:16.760
and the headquarters consolidated them.

712
00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:20.000
The only mistake they made
there was I found the reports.


713
00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:24.400
And then they said, whatever
excuse did they give us?


714
00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:29.120
Well, the one of them, the
only time I really got annoyed


715
00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:33.400
in the courtroom was when
one of these mass murderers,


716
00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:38.360
whose reports I had, how
many Jews they had killed,


717
00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:41.160
he has the gall to say,

718
00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:42.320
"Jews are killed?

719
00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:45.720
"I heard it here in this
court for the first time."


720
00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:49.400
Oh man, I really
just wanna jump over him,

721
00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:51.440
putting a bayonet through his ears.

722
00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:53.360
He'd put it through to the other end,

723
00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:56.520
to improve his hearing.

724
00:42:56.600 --> 00:42:59.280
But otherwise, they said,

725
00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:02.640
you mentioned, two colloquial argument,

726
00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:04.800
that everybody's feeling, "War is war.

727
00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:07.800
"We had to do this because
everybody was at war."


728
00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:11.200
They made that argument
in a very intelligent way.


729
00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:16.280
And it was done by the lead
defendant, Dr. Otto Ohlendorf.


730
00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:19.880
Handsome young man,
father of five children.


731
00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:25.280
He said, "We did this in self-defense."

732
00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:29.240
"Self-defense, nobody,
Germany was not attacked.


733
00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:31.960
"Germany didn't attack, by France,

734
00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:33.640
wasn't attacked by Holland, by Belgium,

735
00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:34.800
"by all the other country.

736
00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:37.240
"Where do you come off with self-defense?"

737
00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:42.040
"Well," he said, "Hitler let us know.

738
00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:43.520
"And he knew more than I did.

739
00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:47.400
I couldn't challenge him that
Russia planned to attack us.


740
00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:49.520
"Therefore it would be necessary for us

741
00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:53.040
"to preempt that and attack first.

742
00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:54.680
"And that's what we did.

743
00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:57.600
"And I have here expert
opinions from German lawyers


744
00:43:57.680 --> 00:44:02.400
"in big bunch of them, saying
preemptive self-defense


745
00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:04.960
"is permissible, it is not a crime.

746
00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:07.560
"And so, we were just

747
00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:10.960
"carrying out our patriotic duty wise."

748
00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:16.080
And I, of course, countered the arguments

749
00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:19.400
and the judges accepted my arguments,

750
00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:21.840
saying, "That's not a defense at all

751
00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:26.640
"because it's not required
by law to preempt anybody.


752
00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:31.720
"And it's a ridiculous and
dangerous policy to adapt it."


753
00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:35.360
- We shall establish,
beyond the realm of doubt,


754
00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:41.120
facts, which before the dark
decade of the Third Reich,


755
00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:43.440
would've seemed incredible.

756
00:44:44.360 --> 00:44:47.720
Courts will show that
the slaughter committed


757
00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:51.160
by these defendants was dictated

758
00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:53.640
not by military necessity,

759
00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:57.160
but by that supreme perversion of thought,

760
00:44:58.040 --> 00:45:01.080
the Nazi theory of the master race.

761
00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:05.200
- My opening sentence to the court was,

762
00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:08.000
"It is with sorrow and with hope

763
00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:11.960
"that we hear disclose mass
murder," et cetera, et cetera.


764
00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:16.840
It was a combination of
sorrow for the victims


765
00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:21.640
and hope that we would be
able to change it in future.


766
00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:26.360
That was my theme
when I opened the trial.

767
00:45:26.440 --> 00:45:29.360
It was my theme
when I closed the trial.

768
00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:32.040
My closing statement, I said,

769
00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:37.360
"The defendants in the dark
were the cruel executioners


770
00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:42.440
"whose terror wrote the
darkest page in human history.


771
00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:46.480
"Life was their toy, death was their tool.

772
00:45:53.360 --> 00:45:55.520
"If these men be immuned,

773
00:45:56.440 --> 00:45:58.480
"then law has lost its meaning,

774
00:45:58.560 --> 00:46:01.080
"and man must live in fear."

775
00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:02.760
That was my closing statement.

776
00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:08.520
- On 29 September, 137 days ago,

777
00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:12.440
the prosecution outlined the evidence

778
00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:13.720
in support of the indictment,

779
00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:16.680
which has been brought
against these defendants.


780
00:46:16.760 --> 00:46:18.760
On 30 September, 1947,

781
00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:23.560
136 days ago, the
prosecution rested this case.


782
00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:28.440
In view of the nature of
the crimes charged here


783
00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:31.400
and the conclusive documentary
proof and support thereof,


784
00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:34.640
the desperate nonsense which
you've encountered here


785
00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:37.160
during the 21 intervening weeks

786
00:46:37.240 --> 00:46:39.880
may jar the ear but it can
hardly surprise the lie.


787
00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:43.800
In summing up this case
after four and a half months,


788
00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:46.080
nearly a week for each defendant,

789
00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:49.880
the prosecution sees no
necessity for or benefit from


790
00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:53.520
a tedious rehearsal of
the details of the record.


791
00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:57.560
- Defendants came out
from, one at a time,

792
00:46:57.640 --> 00:47:00.400
from the cellar down below.

793
00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:04.280
There was a little lift
going into the courthouse.


794
00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:09.240
The doors opened this way,
and they would step out.


795
00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:14.040
And the judge would say,

796
00:47:14.120 --> 00:47:16.880
"For the crimes of which
you all have been convicted,


797
00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:19.800
"this tribunal sentences
you death by hanging."


798
00:47:19.880 --> 00:47:21.840
Next one, "Death by hanging."

799
00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:23.320
"Death by hanging."

800
00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:25.760
I'm writing it down,
and they had 13 of them,


801
00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:28.720
and one after the other,
"Death by hanging."


802
00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:32.920
At the Einsatzgruppen trial,

803
00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:35.480
Martin Sandberger was sentenced

804
00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:38.800
to death by hanging for mass murder.

805
00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:41.880
His defense was that
he was only responsible


806
00:47:41.960 --> 00:47:45.360
for carrying out a
fraction of these killings,


807
00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:50.280
which he estimated to
be 300 to 350 people.


808
00:47:50.360 --> 00:47:53.400
In 1951, his sentence was reduced

809
00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:57.680
to life imprisonment due to
powerful friends intervening.


810
00:47:58.680 --> 00:48:02.160
However, he was released
seven years later.


811
00:48:03.080 --> 00:48:05.360
He died in 2010

812
00:48:05.440 --> 00:48:08.880
in a luxury nursing home, aged 98.

813
00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:14.640
- They're all equally guilty.

814
00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:18.240
Everyone was a mass
murderer or an accessory


815
00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:22.560
to mass murder, beyond any
doubt, any, no doubt whatsoever


816
00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:24.920
because every day it
was their daily bread.


817
00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:27.200
We had 3000 members of the Einsatzgruppen.

818
00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:30.320
I tried 22, 13 of 'em
were sentenced to death.


819
00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:34.920
They were all mass murderers
or accessories to mass murder.


820
00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:37.080
They limited the number
of defendants I could have


821
00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:40.160
to the 22 seats in the
dock, a ridiculous idea.


822
00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:42.400
Ridiculous, absolutely ridiculous,

823
00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:44.120
from point of view of justice.

824
00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:46.440
So you couldn't talk in terms of justice

825
00:48:46.520 --> 00:48:48.640
on these circumstances, I knew that.

826
00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:50.680
The crimes are so enormous

827
00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:52.440
because people thought they were doing

828
00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:54.800
the right thing for their country.

829
00:48:54.880 --> 00:48:58.840
And that danger still exists
and still persists today.


830
00:49:10.440 --> 00:49:12.360
- In the early 1990s,

831
00:49:12.440 --> 00:49:15.080
my parents were running a small

832
00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:16.280
conference retreat center

833
00:49:16.360 --> 00:49:19.560
in the farmhouse here for the church.

834
00:49:19.640 --> 00:49:22.800
And we were going to
create a small exhibition


835
00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:24.200
to say this is important.

836
00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:28.200
These terrible atrocities were a product

837
00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:30.600
of European civilization.

838
00:49:30.680 --> 00:49:34.880
And we need to wake up and
understand how that came about.


839
00:49:36.920 --> 00:49:39.360
How does an event

840
00:49:39.440 --> 00:49:43.320
of the scale of the holocaust occur?

841
00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:47.840
And then 50 years later, it
wasn't even in our curriculum.


842
00:49:47.920 --> 00:49:49.600
We go through the British education system

843
00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:52.240
and learned nothing about it.

844
00:49:52.320 --> 00:49:54.920
And if we don't

845
00:49:55.840 --> 00:49:58.120
learn about that history,

846
00:49:58.200 --> 00:50:00.920
what chance do we
have of learning from it

847
00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:03.520
and ensuring that these kind of

848
00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:06.200
human-made tragedies never happen again?

849
00:50:09.120 --> 00:50:13.280
And so that's the reason that
this memorial developed here


850
00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:16.400
in the Nottinghamshire countryside,
next to Sherwood Forest.


851
00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:21.840
- So I've got here a copy
of the London Agreement


852
00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:24.440
dated the 8th of August, 1945.

853
00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:27.560
And it's between the UK, the USA,

854
00:50:27.640 --> 00:50:29.920
the Provisional Government
of the French Republic,


855
00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:31.560
and the USSR.

856
00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:34.200
In article three it says,

857
00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:38.320
"The Signatories shall also
use their best endeavors


858
00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:41.640
"to make available for investigation

859
00:50:41.720 --> 00:50:45.720
"of the charges against
and the trial before


860
00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:48.840
"the International Military Tribunal

861
00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:52.280
"such of the major war
criminals as are not


862
00:50:52.360 --> 00:50:55.040
"in the territories of
any of the Signatories."


863
00:50:55.120 --> 00:50:56.920
Now this tells me two things.

864
00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:58.440
Now in the film industry,

865
00:50:58.520 --> 00:51:00.200
when you see in a contract,

866
00:51:00.280 --> 00:51:02.280
and somebody's written, "best endeavors,"

867
00:51:02.360 --> 00:51:05.800
you know that that person
has no intention whatsoever


868
00:51:05.880 --> 00:51:08.800
of carrying out the work
they say they're going to do.


869
00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:10.680
And the other point that worries me

870
00:51:10.760 --> 00:51:12.280
is "major war criminals."

871
00:51:12.360 --> 00:51:13.680
What is a major war criminal?

872
00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:15.160
Is somebody like a sergeant

873
00:51:15.240 --> 00:51:17.880
who's killed 150 people over two years,

874
00:51:17.960 --> 00:51:19.320
is he a major war criminal?

875
00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:23.400
Therefore, is this a get-out clause?

876
00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:26.040
- Absolutely, it's a get-out clause.

877
00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:29.880
The British government
certainly had experience


878
00:51:29.960 --> 00:51:33.560
of considering the cost and the scale

879
00:51:33.640 --> 00:51:37.440
of investigating and
prosecuting war criminals


880
00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:39.480
on this kind of scale.

881
00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:41.680
After the first World War,

882
00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:45.080
the British government
arrested 150 officers


883
00:51:45.160 --> 00:51:47.400
from the Ottoman Army who'd been involved

884
00:51:47.480 --> 00:51:50.640
in exterminating over a million Armenians

885
00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:54.560
in what we now refer to
as the Armenian genocide.


886
00:51:54.640 --> 00:51:57.720
And they detained them
on the island of Malta.


887
00:51:57.800 --> 00:52:02.520
And in 1921, released
them without prosecution.


888
00:52:02.600 --> 00:52:04.720
And in part, that was because

889
00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:07.720
there wasn't a legal framework.

890
00:52:07.800 --> 00:52:10.440
The idea of crimes against humanity,

891
00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:12.320
which was used to
describe the extermination


892
00:52:12.400 --> 00:52:14.920
of the Armenians, was
that, it was a concept.


893
00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:17.720
It wasn't embedded in international law.

894
00:52:18.840 --> 00:52:21.200
But the British understood at the time,

895
00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:22.920
even if they had the will

896
00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:25.800
to establish this in international law

897
00:52:25.880 --> 00:52:29.000
and create a tribunal to
prosecute these crimes,


898
00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:34.840
there was a massive cost of
investigating and prosecuting.


899
00:52:34.920 --> 00:52:36.720
And so they abandoned the whole idea

900
00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:39.480
and released the Ottoman officers.

901
00:52:39.560 --> 00:52:42.240
In fact, it was the release
of those Ottoman officers


902
00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:47.320
that set Raphael Lemkin,
the Jewish-Polish lawyer,


903
00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:51.880
of thinking about the
nature of these crimes.


904
00:52:51.960 --> 00:52:54.480
This was right back in 1921.

905
00:52:54.560 --> 00:52:55.920
Also in that same year,

906
00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:58.400
there'd been a trial of an Armenian

907
00:52:58.480 --> 00:53:00.200
called Soghomon Tehlirian.

908
00:53:00.280 --> 00:53:02.760
He was a survivor of
some of these atrocities


909
00:53:02.840 --> 00:53:04.440
in the first World War.

910
00:53:04.520 --> 00:53:08.880
And he had pursued and assassinated one

911
00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:12.280
of the architects of
the Armenian genocide.


912
00:53:13.720 --> 00:53:17.360
Raphael Lemkin was asking
himself the question,


913
00:53:17.440 --> 00:53:22.440
how is it that these 150
officers of the Ottoman Army


914
00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:26.160
are released without investigation

915
00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:28.160
or prosecution by the British

916
00:53:28.240 --> 00:53:30.040
when they are responsible possibly

917
00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:32.480
for the murder of a million people?

918
00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:36.760
And yet for a survivor of that genocide

919
00:53:36.840 --> 00:53:41.160
to assassinate one of those architects

920
00:53:41.240 --> 00:53:44.120
of that genocide is put
on trial for murder.


921
00:53:44.200 --> 00:53:48.360
So you murder a million,
you walk away free.


922
00:53:48.440 --> 00:53:50.040
You murder one person,

923
00:53:50.120 --> 00:53:51.400
and you're put on trial,

924
00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:54.680
even as a victim of that genocide.

925
00:53:59.960 --> 00:54:03.960
- In this valley, on the

926
00:54:04.040 --> 00:54:06.920
just one week before the
Nazi invasion of Poland,


927
00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:09.360
Adolph Hitler gave a
speech to leading members


928
00:54:09.440 --> 00:54:11.240
of the German Army, 
Navy, and Air Force.

929
00:54:11.320 --> 00:54:13.560
And he starts with, "Our strength consists

930
00:54:13.640 --> 00:54:15.800
"in our speed and our brutality.

931
00:54:15.880 --> 00:54:17.880
"Genghis Khan led millions of women

932
00:54:17.960 --> 00:54:19.080
"and children to slaughter

933
00:54:19.160 --> 00:54:21.560
"with premeditation and a happy heart."

934
00:54:21.640 --> 00:54:23.960
He says that he doesn't care about

935
00:54:24.040 --> 00:54:26.200
what other European countries think,

936
00:54:26.280 --> 00:54:28.920
but any member of the German armed forces

937
00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:33.120
who criticize this will be
executed by firing squad.


938
00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:37.560
He urges them to send to
death without compassion men,


939
00:54:37.640 --> 00:54:41.520
women, and children of Polish derivation.

940
00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:45.640
He finishes, "Who, after all, speaks today

941
00:54:45.720 --> 00:54:49.200
"about the annihilation of the Armenians?"

942
00:54:53.360 --> 00:54:56.320
Untold millions of people
were murdered by the Nazis


943
00:54:56.400 --> 00:54:59.840
and their collaborators in 22 countries

944
00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:04.200
that were totally unrelated
to any normal casualty of war.


945
00:55:05.360 --> 00:55:08.000
Jews, Poles, Russian prisoners of war,

946
00:55:08.080 --> 00:55:10.560
Roma, the mentally and
physically handicapped,


947
00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:13.000
political and religious dissidents,

948
00:55:13.080 --> 00:55:16.200
homosexuals, and many more.

949
00:55:16.280 --> 00:55:19.200
And of the three quarters
to one million people


950
00:55:19.280 --> 00:55:22.960
who enthusiastically carried
out these barbaric crimes,


951
00:55:23.040 --> 00:55:26.960
99% of them were never prosecuted.

952
00:55:27.040 --> 00:55:28.720
They were never even looked for.

953
00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:33.320
The Allies, America, Britain,
France and the Soviet Union,


954
00:55:33.400 --> 00:55:36.160
all started their pursuit
of justice well enough.


955
00:55:37.040 --> 00:55:40.880
But for some reason, they simply stopped,

956
00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:44.160
deciding not to proceed any further.

957
00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:47.480
Why?

958
00:55:54.600 --> 00:55:56.520
- The American government
and perhaps the public


959
00:55:56.600 --> 00:55:58.480
were deeply divided.

960
00:55:58.560 --> 00:56:02.360
The State Department and in
public, Senator McCarthy,


961
00:56:02.440 --> 00:56:05.080
were adamantly opposed to
prosecuting the Germans.


962
00:56:05.160 --> 00:56:07.080
They came up with all sorts of excuses

963
00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:09.680
about the Germans who have been in jail,

964
00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:11.120
why they should be let out.

965
00:56:12.680 --> 00:56:16.760
So this process went on up
to the late '40s, but by '48,


966
00:56:16.840 --> 00:56:20.440
the State Department had
really lost patience.


967
00:56:20.520 --> 00:56:23.160
And with the looming Cold War,

968
00:56:23.240 --> 00:56:27.240
the idea was to rebuild Germany.

969
00:56:27.320 --> 00:56:30.480
And so you can argue, well,
maybe we need these scientists


970
00:56:30.560 --> 00:56:32.560
or these bankers or these industrialists

971
00:56:32.640 --> 00:56:33.960
or these skilled people

972
00:56:34.040 --> 00:56:36.320
to rebuild Germany against the communists.

973
00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:39.000
But the answer, the question, really,

974
00:56:39.080 --> 00:56:41.640
for the defenders of this
or for the apologists is


975
00:56:41.720 --> 00:56:43.480
why do you think you have

976
00:56:43.560 --> 00:56:46.080
to let out the death squad leaders?

977
00:56:46.160 --> 00:56:50.280
Why do you have to let out
the concentration camp guards?


978
00:56:50.360 --> 00:56:53.280
What do you need them for
in rebuilding Germany?


979
00:56:53.360 --> 00:56:56.840
And I think that is a
very unpleasant reality


980
00:56:56.920 --> 00:56:58.120
that people have to face up to

981
00:56:58.200 --> 00:57:01.640
when looking to Allied
policy in the later years.


982
00:57:02.440 --> 00:57:06.840
- In 1948, there is a notorious telegram

983
00:57:06.920 --> 00:57:09.960
which the Commonwealth Office

984
00:57:10.040 --> 00:57:13.720
sends to various commonwealth
countries advising them


985
00:57:13.800 --> 00:57:18.640
to stop any further new war crimes trials.

986
00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:21.480
And the reason that's
given at the time is

987
00:57:21.560 --> 00:57:24.040
what's called political
developments in Germany,


988
00:57:24.120 --> 00:57:25.880
which was the government's code

989
00:57:25.960 --> 00:57:28.400
for the onset of the Cold War.

990
00:57:28.480 --> 00:57:31.560
And we know from subsequent evidence

991
00:57:31.640 --> 00:57:34.040
that the likes of Australia and Canada

992
00:57:34.120 --> 00:57:37.800
did indeed stop completely
for the next 40 years.


993
00:57:37.880 --> 00:57:40.400
Two years later, in 1950,

994
00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:43.840
the Foreign Office sends a note,

995
00:57:43.920 --> 00:57:46.240
and this time,

996
00:57:46.320 --> 00:57:49.000
as well as no new trials,

997
00:57:49.080 --> 00:57:52.480
they also say that they're
going to resist even


998
00:57:53.840 --> 00:57:56.160
any requests for deportations

999
00:57:56.240 --> 00:57:59.440
of alleged Nazi war
criminals to other countries.


1000
00:57:59.520 --> 00:58:02.680
And the reason they give is one of

1001
00:58:02.760 --> 00:58:05.880
what I would consider to
be staggering indifference.


1002
00:58:05.960 --> 00:58:08.640
They say, quote, "The wanted man

1003
00:58:08.720 --> 00:58:10.800
"will have been living peaceably

1004
00:58:10.880 --> 00:58:12.640
"in this country for many years.

1005
00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:15.360
"How can it be conducive
to the public good


1006
00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:17.640
"for him to be deported?"

1007
00:58:17.720 --> 00:58:19.320
So if you think
about that for a moment,

1008
00:58:19.400 --> 00:58:23.600
what they're actually saying
is that there is no public good


1009
00:58:23.680 --> 00:58:25.960
in bringing a mass murderer to justice.

1010
00:58:26.760 --> 00:58:29.520
In 1987, the
Australian government


1011
00:58:29.600 --> 00:58:34.600
set up a special unit to
investigate 841 potential suspects.


1012
00:58:35.080 --> 00:58:37.680
It was shut down in 1992

1013
00:58:37.760 --> 00:58:41.120
without a single successful prosecution.

1014
00:58:41.200 --> 00:58:43.160
The Australian solution to the problem

1015
00:58:43.240 --> 00:58:46.440
of suspected Nazi war
criminals was allegedly


1016
00:58:46.520 --> 00:58:50.240
to extradite them and make
it someone else's problem.


1017
00:58:51.520 --> 00:58:55.360
It was suspected that well over 2000 Nazis

1018
00:58:55.440 --> 00:58:57.120
were living in Canada.

1019
00:58:57.200 --> 00:59:00.520
In 1994, the Supreme Court of Canada

1020
00:59:00.600 --> 00:59:03.480
made the Canadian War
Crimes Law unworkable


1021
00:59:03.560 --> 00:59:06.040
by a ruling in
the case of Imre Finta

1022
00:59:06.120 --> 00:59:08.040
who'd been responsible for sending Jews

1023
00:59:08.120 --> 00:59:10.280
to Auschwitz and other camps.

1024
00:59:10.360 --> 00:59:12.480
The court stated that even

1025
00:59:12.560 --> 00:59:15.800
where the orders are manifestly unlawful,

1026
00:59:15.880 --> 00:59:19.000
the defense of obedience
to superior orders


1027
00:59:19.080 --> 00:59:20.840
will be available.

1028
00:59:23.240 --> 00:59:26.800
- The Nuremberg principles
basically is the principle


1029
00:59:26.880 --> 00:59:31.440
that crimes like these war
crimes or crimes against humanity


1030
00:59:31.520 --> 00:59:34.680
shall not be left unpunished.

1031
00:59:34.760 --> 00:59:35.776
This is the most important,

1032
00:59:35.800 --> 00:59:38.760
the core idea behind the
Nuremberg principles.


1033
00:59:38.840 --> 00:59:41.920
But it ended in 1949 with the founding

1034
00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:43.480
of the German Democratic Republic

1035
00:59:43.560 --> 00:59:47.160
and the founding of the
Federal Republic of Germany.


1036
00:59:47.240 --> 00:59:50.400
And from this moment
on, the situation became


1037
00:59:50.480 --> 00:59:54.360
that every accused who was involved

1038
00:59:54.440 --> 00:59:58.320
in a mass killing situation
like in a concentration camp


1039
00:59:58.400 --> 01:00:00.480
or in an extermination camp,

1040
01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:05.760
it was necessary to
prove very meticulously


1041
01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:09.400
that he willingly, that he decided

1042
01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:12.520
to do a crime.

1043
01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:16.040
So you could say that a lot
of the murderers got away


1044
01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:19.400
with what they've done
in the Second World War.


1045
01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:32.400
On the 24th of March, 1944,

1046
01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:35.880
German troops massacred 335 people

1047
01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:37.880
at the Ardeatine Caves in Rome.

1048
01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:54.520
On the 22nd of September, 1944,

1049
01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:57.600
shortly after Italy's liberation,

1050
01:00:57.680 --> 01:01:00.480
Pietro Caruso, an Italian citizen,

1051
01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:04.640
was executed for his part in these crimes.

1052
01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:33.720
SS Captain Erich Priebke,

1053
01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:36.480
awaiting trial for his
part in the massacre,


1054
01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:39.440
escaped by the Ratlines to Argentina

1055
01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:41.480
where he lived for 50 years.

1056
01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:44.760
The outrage following an interview he gave

1057
01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:49.000
on American television led to
him being extradited to Italy.


1058
01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:54.880
In 1996, he was tried
in the military court


1059
01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:57.000
and as he admitted his crimes,

1060
01:01:57.080 --> 01:01:59.400
was found guilty of complicity.

1061
01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:02.440
But the case was
thrown out on the grounds

1062
01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:05.840
that the statute of
limitations had expired.


1063
01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:10.600
Despite many multiple
attempts by Italy and Germany


1064
01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:13.160
to have him properly incarcerated,

1065
01:02:13.240 --> 01:02:18.240
Priebke died in 2013, aged 100.

1066
01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:24.200
Argentina refused his request
to be buried next to his wife


1067
01:02:24.280 --> 01:02:27.480
and the Vatican issued
an unprecedented ban


1068
01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:30.720
in holding his funeral in
any Catholic church in Rome.


1069
01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:34.560
Germany also refused to take the body,

1070
01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:37.400
which was seized by Italian authorities

1071
01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:39.000
and disposed of secretly.

1072
01:02:54.200 --> 01:02:55.960
Most of the well known Nazis,

1073
01:02:56.040 --> 01:02:57.960
the generals, they were all caught,

1074
01:02:58.040 --> 01:02:59.800
weren't they, and prosecuted?

1075
01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:03.120
- No, big Nazis got away with it.

1076
01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:06.480
The Ratline out via the Vatican,

1077
01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:09.880
via Italy to South America
was very successful


1078
01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:10.976
in getting big people out.

1079
01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:12.960
The most notorious, obviously,

1080
01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:16.000
the one that everyone has
heard about is Josef Mengele,


1081
01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:18.680
who went to South America

1082
01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:21.480
and was never found and prosecuted.

1083
01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:25.280
But a lot of former Nazis and perpetrators

1084
01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:28.440
and people who were guilty
of all sorts of things


1085
01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:30.320
stayed within Germany,

1086
01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:32.280
many of them living under their own names,

1087
01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:34.880
not even bothering to
change their identity


1088
01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:37.680
and simply not being brought to court.

1089
01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:39.960
If you look at the statistics,

1090
01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:44.080
99% of people who killed
Jews were never brought


1091
01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:46.920
to court at all, 99%.

1092
01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:48.480
If you look at the sheer numbers

1093
01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:51.200
who were involved in
carrying out the killings,


1094
01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:53.560
we've got somewhere between
three quarters of million


1095
01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:56.080
and a million people actually involved

1096
01:03:56.160 --> 01:03:58.840
in killing Jewish civilians.

1097
01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:01.160
So when you actually
look at the statistics


1098
01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:06.160
of who was brought to
court, it's pretty pathetic.


1099
01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:10.080
The Allies immediately after
the war did a pretty good job.


1100
01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:14.200
They tried hard to bring
the principal perpetrators


1101
01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:17.600
to trial in the Nuremberg
International Military Tribunal


1102
01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:19.720
and the Allied successor trials.

1103
01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:22.680
But it really was the
emergence of the Cold War,


1104
01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:26.080
really from 1947-48 onwards
when the major splits


1105
01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:29.720
between the west and the
Soviet Union become evident.


1106
01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:32.760
And basically, the fight against communism

1107
01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:34.720
became more important for the Americans

1108
01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:38.040
and the West Germans than
trying to deal with Nazism.


1109
01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:40.000
So that's one thing, the Allied attempts

1110
01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:42.360
just petered out very quickly.

1111
01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:44.440
The other thing is, 
I think if you look

1112
01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:48.000
at the three Third Reich successor states,

1113
01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:50.880
West Germany, East Germany, Austria,

1114
01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:54.320
once they take over their own attempts

1115
01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:58.760
to bring former Nazis to trial,
the outcomes are variable,


1116
01:04:58.840 --> 01:05:01.200
but in every single one
of those three cases,


1117
01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:02.760
quite inadequate.

1118
01:05:02.840 --> 01:05:05.400
If you contrast East
Germany and West Germany,


1119
01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:08.760
East Germany instituted a communist state

1120
01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:11.080
that entailed a massive transformation

1121
01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:14.720
of personnel as well as a
transformation of structures.


1122
01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:17.000
So if you look at the
East German judiciary,


1123
01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:19.800
they trained up new judges, new lawyers,

1124
01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:23.760
new teachers, for example
as well, journalists,


1125
01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:24.960
all those professions.

1126
01:05:25.040 --> 01:05:28.680
There was a radical turnover
of personnel in East Germany.


1127
01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:32.200
In West Germany, there is
an incredible continuity.


1128
01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:37.360
The legal profession is deeply Nazified.

1129
01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:39.280
And in fact, by the late 1950s,

1130
01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:42.720
some people have argued that
there was a renazification


1131
01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:45.840
evermore former Nazis
in the legal profession.


1132
01:05:45.920 --> 01:05:48.480
So by the 1950s and '60s,

1133
01:05:48.560 --> 01:05:50.880
you have a lot of
judges, a lot of lawyers,


1134
01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:54.840
a lot of the police forces
actually quite sympathetic


1135
01:05:54.920 --> 01:05:57.640
to the defendants in court.

1136
01:05:57.720 --> 01:05:59.240
And you can see this in the case

1137
01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:01.160
of some judgements, for example.

1138
01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:03.720
You can see it in the
case of tip-offs given


1139
01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:06.920
to Nazi perpetrators that
they're about to be tried,


1140
01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.320
investigated, and they get
out of the country quickly


1141
01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:11.280
or they go underground in some way.

1142
01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:14.560
So there's a personnel
issue in West Germany.


1143
01:06:14.640 --> 01:06:17.760
But secondly, I think there's
a more structural issue,


1144
01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:20.160
which is to do with the choice

1145
01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:24.360
of using the ordinary criminal
law definition of murder


1146
01:06:24.440 --> 01:06:27.480
and not the wider Nuremberg principles.

1147
01:06:27.560 --> 01:06:32.280
And so even if you get a
totally anti-Nazi young lawyer,


1148
01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:36.000
that lawyer has to operate
within the confines


1149
01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:39.000
of the legal system and the definitions

1150
01:06:39.080 --> 01:06:41.520
as they are in the penal code.

1151
01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:46.200
And so what this means is
that it's simply inappropriate


1152
01:06:46.280 --> 01:06:49.080
to putting mass murder on trial.

1153
01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:53.640
State sponsored, initiated
state-ordained violence,


1154
01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:56.520
you cannot put that kind
of genocide on trial


1155
01:06:56.600 --> 01:06:58.920
under the ordinary definition

1156
01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.120
of individually-motivated murder.

1157
01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:07.760
Walter Rauff
designed the gas fans


1158
01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:11.000
that killed Jews,
communists, and the disabled.


1159
01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:13.096
Thought to have been responsible

1160
01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:15.480
for nearly 100,000 deaths,

1161
01:07:15.560 --> 01:07:19.320
he was arrested in 1945, but escaped.

1162
01:07:20.360 --> 01:07:23.200
Later, he worked for
the Syrian intelligence


1163
01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:26.880
and an early incarnation of
the Israeli Secret Service


1164
01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:29.080
who helped him escape to South America.

1165
01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:34.400
He died unpunished in
Chile in 1984, aged 77.


1166
01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:53.200
- After the war, 1946,

1167
01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:55.120
Central Europe, particularly around

1168
01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:57.320
the Allied zones of occupation,

1169
01:07:57.400 --> 01:08:00.960
they resemble a giant refugee camp.

1170
01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:03.200
So you have somewhere in the region

1171
01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:05.960
of two million individuals,

1172
01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:09.120
all of whom are trying to
register as displaced persons.


1173
01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:13.080
Now, to be a displaced person,
you get food and shelter.


1174
01:08:13.160 --> 01:08:16.200
And the only condition
that the Allies applied was


1175
01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:19.680
that you couldn't be a Nazi collaborator.

1176
01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:23.120
And in order to accept any individual,

1177
01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:24.880
they had to be screened.

1178
01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:27.840
Well, the British applied
almost no screening.


1179
01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:29.800
It was entirely perfunctory.

1180
01:08:29.880 --> 01:08:32.280
And there's also, in
many Allied countries,


1181
01:08:32.360 --> 01:08:37.160
particularly in France and in
the UK, a huge labor shortage.


1182
01:08:37.240 --> 01:08:41.040
So somewhere in the region
of 90,000 individuals


1183
01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:42.840
are brought over to the UK

1184
01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:47.040
to fill gaps in mainly manual jobs,

1185
01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:51.200
and most of them are Baltic,
Ukrainian, Polish nationals.


1186
01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:56.000
And then a further 90,000
are brought over under a


1187
01:08:56.080 --> 01:09:00.320
resettlement scheme for brave
Polish resistance fighters.


1188
01:09:01.400 --> 01:09:06.120
And of course, secreted
within both of these caters


1189
01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:09.840
are a number of individuals
who were responsible


1190
01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:12.960
for perpetrating crimes under the Nazis.

1191
01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:15.960
Just to give an indication as to

1192
01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:18.840
how little the British
authorities were bothered


1193
01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:20.160
about who was coming in,

1194
01:09:21.400 --> 01:09:23.200
there was a story that we heard

1195
01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:25.320
from Baroness Ryder of Warsaw,

1196
01:09:25.400 --> 01:09:28.040
or Sue Ryder of Sue Ryder
Homes, as she then was,


1197
01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:31.360
in 1946, she's a relief worker working

1198
01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:34.080
in a displaced person's camp.

1199
01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:37.760
And she's processing a number
of Baltic nationals through,


1200
01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:41.640
and she notices that
they all have a scar

1201
01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:44.800
under their right armpit
in the same place.


1202
01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:47.520
And of course, what
she realizes is this is


1203
01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:50.600
where their SS tattoo had been

1204
01:09:50.680 --> 01:09:53.480
and where they all had it removed.

1205
01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:55.680
And she raises this and she's told

1206
01:09:55.760 --> 01:09:57.560
to effectively mind her business

1207
01:09:57.640 --> 01:10:00.000
and get on with the job of processing.

1208
01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:02.880
What action did
they take against them?


1209
01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:03.720
- I think one thing to remember is

1210
01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:08.640
that the UK government operated
from the late '40s onwards


1211
01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:11.600
for the next 40 years
under a perfect cover.


1212
01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:13.200
They didn't have to do anything

1213
01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:16.360
because there was no law in the UK

1214
01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:19.880
which would enable the
prosecution of these individuals.


1215
01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:21.840
So it was only in the '80s,

1216
01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:26.520
after a major parliamentary
fight over five years


1217
01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:29.160
that we actually got the War Crimes Act

1218
01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:32.120
in this country enacted in 1991.

1219
01:10:32.200 --> 01:10:33.536
- There's something I wanna talk about,

1220
01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:36.160
which I'm sure you know well.

1221
01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:37.720
These are two newspapers.

1222
01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:40.080
This is the Times,
which I'll give to you.

1223
01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:41.640
And this is The Telegraph,

1224
01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:46.080
and it's dated Wednesday,
the 4th of March, 1987.


1225
01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:48.200
And they're talking
here in the editorials,


1226
01:10:48.280 --> 01:10:50.840
so there's nobody's name attached to it.

1227
01:10:50.920 --> 01:10:54.600
And it's discussing pressure
from various individuals


1228
01:10:54.680 --> 01:10:57.200
and bodies who are
asking and making demands


1229
01:10:57.280 --> 01:10:59.600
about the presence of, in Britain,

1230
01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:02.640
of 17 alleged former Nazis.

1231
01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:05.280
So there's this bit which
I find extraordinary.


1232
01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:07.440
It says, "Nazi hunting has become a new

1233
01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:09.920
"and frankly distasteful blood sport.

1234
01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.840
"It is no reflection of antisemitism

1235
01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:15.720
"or the indifference to past atrocities

1236
01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:18.600
"to feel an overwhelming
revulsion against the notion


1237
01:11:18.680 --> 01:11:21.920
"of further war crimes
trials almost half a century


1238
01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.560
"after the alleged horrors took place."

1239
01:11:24.640 --> 01:11:27.000
I can't actually believe
they're using that word,


1240
01:11:27.080 --> 01:11:28.080
"alleged horrors."

1241
01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:30.400
And this carries on and it says,

1242
01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:33.120
"There is a futility, a sterility

1243
01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:36.000
"about continuing a search for vengeance

1244
01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:39.520
"beyond the certain
limits of time and space."


1245
01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:42.720
And this sort of predisposes

1246
01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:46.280
that there should be a
time limit on justice.


1247
01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:48.160
- This is the Times the day before

1248
01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:50.280
the Telegraph article appeared.

1249
01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:54.600
And many of those who opposed any action

1250
01:11:54.680 --> 01:11:57.440
on Nazi war criminals in
this country at the time,


1251
01:11:57.520 --> 01:12:00.160
pitted what was described as

1252
01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:03.280
the Christian God of mercy,

1253
01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:06.040
the New Testament God of mercy

1254
01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:09.320
versus the Old Testament God of vengeance.

1255
01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:14.160
And it's hard to imagine this
appearing in the Times today,


1256
01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:16.880
but this was the late 1980s.

1257
01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:18.160
And this is just an extract

1258
01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:21.240
from the lead editorial
that day, which says,


1259
01:12:21.320 --> 01:12:23.280
"Britain is a Christian country.

1260
01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:26.440
"Its laws enshrine principles
of justice tempered


1261
01:12:26.520 --> 01:12:29.120
"with mercy, not vengeance."

1262
01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:31.800
The undertones of that
I think are very clear.


1263
01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:34.520
Sad to say, the reason why vengeance

1264
01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:36.880
and the idea of vengeance
was so powerful is


1265
01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:41.480
that it played into
ancient antisemitic tropes


1266
01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:45.960
that the Jews are only
out for an eye for an eye,


1267
01:12:46.040 --> 01:12:46.920
tooth for a tooth.

1268
01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.320
During the debate in the House of Lords,

1269
01:12:49.400 --> 01:12:53.040
a peer by the name of
Lady Saltoun of Abernathy,


1270
01:12:53.120 --> 01:12:57.840
who is also the chief of the
Fraser clan, stood up and said,


1271
01:12:57.920 --> 01:13:00.320
"How can it be justified

1272
01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:03.000
"to allow one group of aliens

1273
01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:07.240
"to pursue their vengeance
against another group of aliens


1274
01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:12.320
"for crimes committed 50 years
ago in a country far away?"


1275
01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:17.000
And I think more than anything
I've ever heard on this,


1276
01:13:17.080 --> 01:13:18.720
I think that summarizes the indifference

1277
01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:20.280
of many on this question.

1278
01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:23.920
Vengeance is a very different thing.

1279
01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:27.360
What did the Nazis and their
willing collaborators do?


1280
01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:29.920
They murdered, they committed genocide.

1281
01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:33.600
And to do the same is vengeance.

1282
01:13:33.680 --> 01:13:37.600
This is using the one
thing that the Nazis denied


1283
01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:41.000
to their victims, the
law and the right to law.


1284
01:13:41.080 --> 01:13:43.000
It's using the law

1285
01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:45.920
to give them a fair trial,

1286
01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:51.400
in a system which has got
high evidentiary rules,


1287
01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:54.360
to enable them to put
their very best defense


1288
01:13:54.440 --> 01:13:56.240
and to let justice take its course.

1289
01:13:59.080 --> 01:14:00.400
Anton Gecas took part

1290
01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:04.600
in executing up to 40,000 Jews
and Russian prisoners of war


1291
01:14:04.680 --> 01:14:08.840
in the Baltic states in
Belarus during 1941 to 1944


1292
01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:13.480
as a leftenant and the

1293
01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:16.000
and was awarded the Iron Cross.

1294
01:14:17.080 --> 01:14:21.320
When he saw that Germany was
losing, he switched sides.


1295
01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:25.200
He lived in Scotland from 1947

1296
01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:27.400
and worked for the National Coal Board

1297
01:14:27.480 --> 01:14:29.560
and ran a popular bed and breakfast.

1298
01:14:30.600 --> 01:14:34.440
Despite the Lithuanian authorities
trying to extradite him,


1299
01:14:34.520 --> 01:14:39.240
he died in Edinburgh in

1300
01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:44.560
His neighbors in the
Scottish capital were Jewish.


1301
01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.240
- I was the director of the

1302
01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:55.320
All-Party Parliamentary War
Crimes Group from 1986 to 1991.


1303
01:14:55.480 --> 01:14:58.560
And the War Crimes Group
was a cross-party group


1304
01:14:58.640 --> 01:15:01.080
of members of parliament and peers

1305
01:15:01.160 --> 01:15:04.200
who were constituted, or
constituted themselves,


1306
01:15:04.280 --> 01:15:07.560
in order to pressure the government

1307
01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:09.920
to face up to its responsibility

1308
01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.960
for Britain not to be a
haven for Nazi war criminals,


1309
01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:14.880
that there was a case to answer

1310
01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:16.136
against the number of individuals,

1311
01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:18.000
that the law should be changed,

1312
01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:21.920
and that a unit should
be set up to investigate.


1313
01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:25.400
And following a fairly
bloody parliamentary battle,


1314
01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:28.840
an act, the War Crimes Act, 1991,

1315
01:15:28.920 --> 01:15:31.000
was passed to enable this to happen.

1316
01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:33.960
As to what happened afterwards,

1317
01:15:34.040 --> 01:15:37.200
in terms of actual
investigations and prosecutions,


1318
01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:40.520
what we do know
is that at its height,

1319
01:15:40.600 --> 01:15:43.680
the Metropolitan Police's War Crimes Unit

1320
01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:47.800
had somewhere in the
region of 400 active cases.


1321
01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:50.880
But there was only one
successful prosecution.


1322
01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:52.600
There was only one prosecution.

1323
01:15:52.680 --> 01:15:57.120
And the reason that we're
here is that for many years,


1324
01:15:57.200 --> 01:16:00.920
this was home to Anthony Sawoniuk.

1325
01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.840
This is the Rouel Road
estate in Bermondsey.


1326
01:16:03.920 --> 01:16:05.960
He had managed to get himself here

1327
01:16:06.040 --> 01:16:08.320
as part of the Polish resettlement.

1328
01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:10.920
So he arrives in this country in '46

1329
01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:12.960
and he settles in Surrey,

1330
01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:15.120
and he does a number
of jobs over the years,


1331
01:16:15.200 --> 01:16:18.640
from hospital water to ending
up as a ticket collector


1332
01:16:18.720 --> 01:16:21.800
at London Bridge Station
and living in this estate.


1333
01:16:21.880 --> 01:16:25.440
He retired and got a very nice pension

1334
01:16:25.520 --> 01:16:28.440
on which he could live out
the remainder of his years.


1335
01:16:28.520 --> 01:16:31.040
- And how many people do
we know that he killed?


1336
01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:37.520
- He was convicted for killing 18 people.

1337
01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:40.400
At his trial, there was testimony

1338
01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:42.120
from an old school friend of his

1339
01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:46.720
who witnessed him murdering 15 women

1340
01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:48.480
who he'd ordered to undress,

1341
01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:50.240
spraying them with machine gun

1342
01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:52.520
and then pushing them into pits.

1343
01:16:53.480 --> 01:16:55.680
There is plenty of evidence,

1344
01:16:55.760 --> 01:16:57.600
but the evidence wasn't strong enough

1345
01:16:57.680 --> 01:16:59.880
on which to mount the charges

1346
01:16:59.960 --> 01:17:03.360
that he was involved in
many, many more murders.


1347
01:17:03.440 --> 01:17:06.480
The trial was successful,
he was found guilty,


1348
01:17:06.560 --> 01:17:09.480
he appealed, his appeal was thrown out,

1349
01:17:09.560 --> 01:17:14.240
and he ended his final days
in prison, dying in 2005.


1350
01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:20.280
- One month after
Anthony Sawoniuk was sent


1351
01:17:20.360 --> 01:17:21.600
to prison in Norwich,

1352
01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:24.240
the Metropolitan War
Crimes Unit was closed down


1353
01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:25.816
and all the information they'd gathered

1354
01:17:25.840 --> 01:17:28.120
over many years was put into boxes,

1355
01:17:28.200 --> 01:17:31.240
and then those were sealed
for, I think, 50 years.


1356
01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:34.680
My feeling is is that somebody

1357
01:17:34.760 --> 01:17:38.160
in the Crown Prosecution
Service or the government said,


1358
01:17:38.240 --> 01:17:42.360
"Look, we just spent 6.5
million prosecuting Sawoniuk.


1359
01:17:42.440 --> 01:17:46.960
"So if we were to spend the
money prosecuting 10, 20, 30,


1360
01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:50.160
"whatever it was, men, it's
going to be very expensive.


1361
01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:51.400
"And why should we do it?

1362
01:17:51.480 --> 01:17:55.320
"It all took place a long time
ago, a long way from here."


1363
01:17:55.400 --> 01:17:59.600
So they just buried the information

1364
01:17:59.680 --> 01:18:03.400
and thought that nobody
would kick up a fuss,


1365
01:18:03.480 --> 01:18:06.240
which as it turned out,
was exactly the case,


1366
01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:09.240
apart from a few people
in the Jewish community.


1367
01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:12.240
Therefore, if this was the case,

1368
01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:14.640
justice has a price tag.

1369
01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:31.200
Germany
calling, Germany calling.


1370
01:18:32.680 --> 01:18:36.960
I want to discuss with you some
topics of current interest.


1371
01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:42.120
Three weeks ago, Mr. Chamberlain
predicted the possibility


1372
01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:45.360
of warfare in Scandinavia.

1373
01:18:45.440 --> 01:18:49.520
Nobody in Britain paid any
great attention to his prophecy


1374
01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:52.000
as it lacked the note of novelty.

1375
01:18:52.080 --> 01:18:56.560
Four days ago, under the orders
of their supreme commander,


1376
01:18:56.640 --> 01:19:00.440
the German forces established
one of the greatest feats


1377
01:19:00.520 --> 01:19:03.640
and in the
annals of military history.


1378
01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:11.400
- This is the last resting
place of William Joyce,


1379
01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:13.680
better known as Lord Haw
-Haw,

1380
01:19:13.760 --> 01:19:15.600
who broadcast Nazi propaganda

1381
01:19:15.680 --> 01:19:17.760
to the British people throughout the war.

1382
01:19:19.080 --> 01:19:21.880
Although a particularly
offensive anti-Semite,


1383
01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:25.800
he never actually killed
anyone nor incited murder.


1384
01:19:25.880 --> 01:19:28.800
Joyce had falsely obtained
a British passport


1385
01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:32.280
simply by lying and this
flimsy evidence was enough


1386
01:19:32.360 --> 01:19:34.760
to ensure that he stood trial for treason.

1387
01:19:35.840 --> 01:19:38.240
The trial judge directed the jury

1388
01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:40.880
that as a matter of law,
he was British enough


1389
01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:43.520
and they need not be concerned anymore.

1390
01:19:47.880 --> 01:19:52.320
He was executed on the

1391
01:19:54.880 --> 01:19:57.720
Joyce, who broadcast
directly from Germany,


1392
01:19:57.800 --> 01:20:01.160
was actually an American
citizen born in Brooklyn,


1393
01:20:01.240 --> 01:20:04.120
and he grew up here in neutral Ireland.

1394
01:20:04.200 --> 01:20:06.880
This is his former school.

1395
01:20:08.560 --> 01:20:11.280
Therefore, how could he
possibly be prosecuted


1396
01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:14.680
for treason against the United Kingdom?

1397
01:20:30.840 --> 01:20:34.040
So the British government bend the rules

1398
01:20:34.120 --> 01:20:35.840
so they can hang a man for treason,

1399
01:20:35.920 --> 01:20:38.760
even though that man never
actually committed treason


1400
01:20:38.840 --> 01:20:42.840
because they say that was
justice and not vengeance.


1401
01:20:42.920 --> 01:20:45.200
However, for over 40 years,

1402
01:20:45.280 --> 01:20:47.960
almost 400 suspected Nazi war criminals,

1403
01:20:48.040 --> 01:20:50.960
many of them who had
committed multiple murders,


1404
01:20:51.040 --> 01:20:54.080
are not prosecuted
because that will be seen


1405
01:20:54.160 --> 01:20:56.880
to be vengeance and not justice.

1406
01:21:08.600 --> 01:21:10.960
Michael Karkoc
was a founding member


1407
01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:13.280
and a leftenant in the second company

1408
01:21:13.360 --> 01:21:16.520
of the Ukrainian Self
-Defense Legion,

1409
01:21:16.600 --> 01:21:19.480
which he admitted in his
Ukrainian language memoir,


1410
01:21:19.560 --> 01:21:22.880
published in the USA in 1995.

1411
01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:27.600
He would later transfer to the Galician,

1412
01:21:27.680 --> 01:21:29.960
14th Waffen SS Division.

1413
01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:33.280
Both units carried out war crimes

1414
01:21:33.360 --> 01:21:36.200
against civilians in
the Ukraine and Poland,


1415
01:21:36.280 --> 01:21:39.800
including the 1944 Warsaw Uprising.

1416
01:21:42.280 --> 01:21:45.600
Karkoc escaped to the USA in 1950,

1417
01:21:45.680 --> 01:21:48.200
lying to American immigration officers.

1418
01:21:49.080 --> 01:21:51.240
In March, 2017,

1419
01:21:51.320 --> 01:21:53.200
the Polish government announced

1420
01:21:53.280 --> 01:21:56.480
that it would be seeking
the extradition of Karkoc.


1421
01:21:56.560 --> 01:21:59.400
However, he died before this happened

1422
01:21:59.480 --> 01:22:02.480
in Minnesota in 2019,

1423
01:22:02.560 --> 01:22:04.760
aged 100 years.

1424
01:22:12.800 --> 01:22:15.080
Karkoc's name
surfaced after decades


1425
01:22:15.160 --> 01:22:17.280
of forensic research carried out

1426
01:22:17.360 --> 01:22:20.200
by London-based retired
clinical pharmacologist,


1427
01:22:20.280 --> 01:22:22.000
Dr. Steve Ankier.

1428
01:22:23.240 --> 01:22:25.600
Some members of Karkoc's unit were among

1429
01:22:25.680 --> 01:22:28.520
the 400 suspected Nazi war criminals

1430
01:22:28.600 --> 01:22:30.320
that ended up living in the UK.

1431
01:22:31.840 --> 01:22:33.720
So I asked Stephen to show me where.

1432
01:22:35.720 --> 01:22:39.000
- We're in Oldham because
my research showed


1433
01:22:39.880 --> 01:22:40.880
two people who belonged

1434
01:22:40.960 --> 01:22:44.600
to the Ukrainian Self-Defense
Legion lived here,


1435
01:22:45.440 --> 01:22:47.880
who were originally,

1436
01:22:47.960 --> 01:22:51.160
I would guess, 
Ukrainian nationalists.

1437
01:22:51.240 --> 01:22:54.640
And they were against the Soviets

1438
01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:58.800
who had caused a major
famine in the early 1930s,


1439
01:22:58.880 --> 01:23:00.080
known as the Holodomor.

1440
01:23:01.400 --> 01:23:04.760
But then they joined the Germans

1441
01:23:04.840 --> 01:23:07.400
and eventually they were
turned into killers.


1442
01:23:09.040 --> 01:23:12.800
They were used to violently
pacify villages for the Nazis,


1443
01:23:13.640 --> 01:23:16.880
and there were at least
two of these killers


1444
01:23:16.960 --> 01:23:18.560
that lived in Oldham.

1445
01:23:19.800 --> 01:23:23.120
One of the killers was very
near to where we are now.


1446
01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:25.080
His name was Eurico Parra,

1447
01:23:26.280 --> 01:23:29.000
but my research showed that
that wasn't his real name.


1448
01:23:30.040 --> 01:23:33.960
His real name was Ivan
Petrovich Lachmanyuk.


1449
01:23:34.920 --> 01:23:37.280
And I discovered this by being in touch

1450
01:23:37.360 --> 01:23:39.760
with the Ukrainian Security Services.

1451
01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:42.920
They sent me a photograph

1452
01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:46.920
of Ivan Petrovich Lachmanyuk,

1453
01:23:47.960 --> 01:23:52.960
with the address of Eurico
Parra, which was very strange.


1454
01:23:54.440 --> 01:23:57.920
And then I found something else in Warsaw,

1455
01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:01.000
I visited the National
Remembrance Library there.


1456
01:24:01.840 --> 01:24:05.560
And I eventually dug up an arrest warrant,

1457
01:24:05.640 --> 01:24:09.480
which the Russians issued in 1970

1458
01:24:09.560 --> 01:24:13.200
for Ivan Petrovich Lachmanyuk

1459
01:24:13.280 --> 01:24:15.520
for machine-gunning villages

1460
01:24:15.600 --> 01:24:19.200
in the Volyn region of
present-day Ukraine,


1461
01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:21.960
under the command of Michael Karkoc,

1462
01:24:22.040 --> 01:24:23.520
and again on the arrest warrant,

1463
01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:25.680
the address for Eurico Parra.

1464
01:24:27.080 --> 01:24:31.840
- So you got all this information
together in a dossier.


1465
01:24:31.920 --> 01:24:33.120
What did you do with it?

1466
01:24:34.720 --> 01:24:36.520
- I gave it to New Scotland Yard.

1467
01:24:37.480 --> 01:24:40.800
Very unfortunate, and these things happen,

1468
01:24:41.960 --> 01:24:44.160
the day that I presented
it to them was one day


1469
01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:47.680
before he died in Oldham
in a nursing home.


1470
01:24:53.160 --> 01:24:54.480
Well, we're still in Oldham.

1471
01:24:54.560 --> 01:24:56.200
We're in the street where a man

1472
01:24:56.280 --> 01:24:58.920
called Dmytro Wiazewycz lived,

1473
01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:03.640
and he was under the direct
command of Michael Karkoc.


1474
01:25:03.720 --> 01:25:07.360
He was almost certainly
involved in the destruction


1475
01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:09.600
of villages in the Lublin area

1476
01:25:09.680 --> 01:25:13.920
and the murder of several
hundred villagers.


1477
01:25:14.920 --> 01:25:18.480
Dmytro Wiazewycz lived in this house.

1478
01:25:18.560 --> 01:25:21.000
- You actually got
to meet this man, then?

1479
01:25:21.080 --> 01:25:24.640
- I didn't get to meet him,
I went to his front door.


1480
01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:27.200
My intention was to confront him

1481
01:25:27.280 --> 01:25:30.120
and ask him about his
career during the war,


1482
01:25:30.200 --> 01:25:31.760
whether he was involved in war crimes.

1483
01:25:31.840 --> 01:25:35.280
I had a lot of evidence, a lot
of rosters with his name on,


1484
01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:37.680
matching date of birth, place of birth,

1485
01:25:37.760 --> 01:25:41.200
with his naturalization certificate.

1486
01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:42.880
Unfortunately, at the time,

1487
01:25:42.960 --> 01:25:44.256
there was a carer there and he was,

1488
01:25:44.280 --> 01:25:46.440
I think, having some medical attention.

1489
01:25:46.520 --> 01:25:47.696
So we weren't allowed to go in,

1490
01:25:47.720 --> 01:25:49.560
but I could hear his voice inside.

1491
01:25:50.680 --> 01:25:53.080
And very, very soon afterwards, he died.

1492
01:25:53.160 --> 01:25:54.720
So that was the end of it.

1493
01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:30.280
- Up until 1290 when Edward
I kicked them all out,


1494
01:26:30.360 --> 01:26:34.120
Lincoln was the largest population of Jews

1495
01:26:34.200 --> 01:26:36.600
in the whole of the UK.

1496
01:26:36.680 --> 01:26:40.680
And it just strikes me as really odd

1497
01:26:40.760 --> 01:26:45.720
that a possible killer of
Jews chose to come here.


1498
01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:47.400
What's his name?

1499
01:26:48.320 --> 01:26:50.600
- My research showed
that there was a man

1500
01:26:50.680 --> 01:26:54.240
called Mikhail Mankel,

1501
01:26:54.320 --> 01:26:57.400
and he was in the fourth company

1502
01:26:57.480 --> 01:27:00.400
of the Ukrainian Self
-Defense Division.

1503
01:27:00.480 --> 01:27:01.800
And there was a massacre

1504
01:27:01.880 --> 01:27:06.680
in a place called Chłaniów and Władysławin

1505
01:27:06.760 --> 01:27:09.600
where 44 villagers were killed.

1506
01:27:09.680 --> 01:27:12.960
They threw grenades into burning houses.

1507
01:27:13.040 --> 01:27:16.200
Amongst the 44 killed were some children.

1508
01:27:16.280 --> 01:27:18.920
There are several rosters

1509
01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:22.880
of members of the Ukrainian
Self-Defense Legion,


1510
01:27:22.960 --> 01:27:27.800
which I uncovered, they show
where they were at the time,


1511
01:27:27.880 --> 01:27:31.320
the full name of the members
of the various companies,


1512
01:27:31.400 --> 01:27:33.920
the date of birth, and
also the place of birth


1513
01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
of members of the Legion.

1514
01:27:36.080 --> 01:27:38.400
And with that information,

1515
01:27:38.480 --> 01:27:42.400
I searched an online directory in the UK

1516
01:27:42.480 --> 01:27:45.560
and looked for the names of various people

1517
01:27:45.640 --> 01:27:50.200
and found several names which matched.

1518
01:27:50.280 --> 01:27:52.200
Like in the case of this
particular individual,


1519
01:27:52.280 --> 01:27:54.880
when I looked, he'd
actually been long dead.


1520
01:28:10.400 --> 01:28:12.760
We're in Keighley at
the moment in Yorkshire,


1521
01:28:12.840 --> 01:28:14.200
it's quite near Selby,

1522
01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:17.760
where there was a camp for these men

1523
01:28:17.840 --> 01:28:21.760
of the Ukrainian Self
-Defense Legion.

1524
01:28:21.840 --> 01:28:25.640
And because of that, there are a number

1525
01:28:25.720 --> 01:28:30.720
of potential war crime
suspects in this area.


1526
01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:33.880
And the one that I
discovered here in Keighley


1527
01:28:33.960 --> 01:28:35.200
was called Ostap Kykawec.

1528
01:28:36.640 --> 01:28:38.440
He's dead now, but he did serve

1529
01:28:38.520 --> 01:28:43.520
in the fourth company of
the 31st Punitive Battalion.


1530
01:28:44.240 --> 01:28:46.280
And had he been alive,

1531
01:28:46.360 --> 01:28:48.480
then he would've been a very suitable case

1532
01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:50.600
to have been referred
to the War Crimes Unit


1533
01:28:50.680 --> 01:28:53.560
of the Metropolitan Police Service.

1534
01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.840
Here in Bradford, there
were another two suspects.


1535
01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:05.760
There was somebody called
Alexander Némirovsky,


1536
01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:09.160
who is recorded as having
been a machine-gunner


1537
01:29:09.240 --> 01:29:14.040
in the Warsaw Uprising,
working for the Nazis in 1944.


1538
01:29:15.440 --> 01:29:18.720
And then there was a
man called Ostap Jastrov


1539
01:29:19.760 --> 01:29:23.640
who was also known as Alexander Baranchuk

1540
01:29:23.720 --> 01:29:27.480
who had his photograph
taken with Michael Karkoc


1541
01:29:27.560 --> 01:29:31.240
during the war with some of
the other members of the unit.


1542
01:29:31.320 --> 01:29:32.400
- And they're both dead.

1543
01:29:32.480 --> 01:29:34.080
- They're both dead.

1544
01:29:34.160 --> 01:29:35.720
That's very unfortunate

1545
01:29:35.800 --> 01:29:38.440
because they were both very good suspects

1546
01:29:38.520 --> 01:29:41.440
for the War Crimes Unit
to have a further look at


1547
01:29:41.520 --> 01:29:45.920
and hopefully some justice would've come.

1548
01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:50.440
But unfortunately, it's another
example of justice denied


1549
01:29:50.520 --> 01:29:54.600
and two people potentially
having got away with murder.


1550
01:30:02.160 --> 01:30:06.120
- Stephen did very detailed
research over many decades,


1551
01:30:06.200 --> 01:30:10.400
and he threw up a lot of
suspected war criminals,


1552
01:30:10.480 --> 01:30:13.080
all of them men, no women at all.

1553
01:30:13.160 --> 01:30:16.760
All over the UK and Birmingham, and Leeds,

1554
01:30:16.840 --> 01:30:20.280
and Middlesbrough, Derby,
Bolton, Wolverhampton,


1555
01:30:20.360 --> 01:30:24.160
Halifax, Kings Lynn,
Rugby, Camden in London.


1556
01:30:24.240 --> 01:30:27.160
Stephen though is an amateur.

1557
01:30:27.240 --> 01:30:28.960
He did hand over all his information

1558
01:30:29.040 --> 01:30:31.640
to the Metropolitan War Crimes Unit.

1559
01:30:31.720 --> 01:30:33.640
But the unit was closed down.

1560
01:30:35.120 --> 01:30:38.640
This has all come about
because the powers that be,


1561
01:30:38.720 --> 01:30:40.160
for whatever reason,

1562
01:30:40.240 --> 01:30:42.200
when they should have investigated this

1563
01:30:42.280 --> 01:30:44.640
in the '40s and '50s, they didn't.

1564
01:30:44.720 --> 01:30:49.080
And now what we have is
a very shameful chapter


1565
01:30:49.160 --> 01:30:50.840
in British criminal history.

1566
01:30:56.840 --> 01:30:59.160
After the war, the narrative defense

1567
01:30:59.240 --> 01:31:01.160
that many countries adopted was

1568
01:31:01.240 --> 01:31:04.320
that they were forced into
their actions against the Jews


1569
01:31:04.400 --> 01:31:08.480
because they were an invaded
country and they had no choice.


1570
01:31:10.160 --> 01:31:11.960
Although Bulgaria had Jews deported

1571
01:31:12.040 --> 01:31:15.400
from the newly-occupied
Yugoslav and Greek territories,


1572
01:31:15.480 --> 01:31:17.440
they stopped short of delivering

1573
01:31:17.520 --> 01:31:19.400
their own Jews to the Nazis,

1574
01:31:19.480 --> 01:31:22.640
saving the lives of 48,000 people.

1575
01:31:25.200 --> 01:31:29.320
Courageous Danish citizens
managed to evacuate 7,220


1576
01:31:30.720 --> 01:31:33.360
of Denmark's 7,800 Jews

1577
01:31:33.440 --> 01:31:35.360
to neutral Sweden by boat.

1578
01:31:36.720 --> 01:31:39.960
Albania, 80% Muslim,

1579
01:31:40.040 --> 01:31:41.800
was the only occupied country

1580
01:31:41.880 --> 01:31:45.640
where almost no Jews
died or were handed over.


1581
01:31:45.720 --> 01:31:48.840
And the Albanians
heroically protected Jews


1582
01:31:48.920 --> 01:31:51.920
who sought refuge in their
country during the war.


1583
01:31:53.480 --> 01:31:56.160
These were the few exceptions.

1584
01:31:57.440 --> 01:31:59.440
The minutes from a Slovak German meeting

1585
01:31:59.520 --> 01:32:02.920
on the 29th of April, 1942 state,

1586
01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.960
"For every Jew of Slovak citizenship

1587
01:32:06.040 --> 01:32:08.600
"transferred into the Reich's territory,

1588
01:32:08.680 --> 01:32:10.880
"the German government
will be paid an amount


1589
01:32:10.960 --> 01:32:13.360
"of 500 Reichsmarks."

1590
01:32:15.680 --> 01:32:18.680
The death camps were the only
German territory they visited.


1591
01:32:25.400 --> 01:32:28.440
- One way to
think about the Nazi system

1592
01:32:28.520 --> 01:32:31.160
is that to all intents and purposes,

1593
01:32:31.240 --> 01:32:33.840
it was a morality-free zone.

1594
01:32:33.920 --> 01:32:37.680
We are used, in the West,
to seeing our legal systems


1595
01:32:37.760 --> 01:32:40.400
as being built very much on the template

1596
01:32:40.480 --> 01:32:42.240
of the 10 Commandments.

1597
01:32:42.320 --> 01:32:45.920
So we're used to seeing laws such as,

1598
01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:47.040
"Thou shalt not steal.

1599
01:32:47.120 --> 01:32:49.200
"Thou shalt not bare false witness.

1600
01:32:49.280 --> 01:32:50.520
"Thou shalt not murder."

1601
01:32:50.600 --> 01:32:52.320
We're very familiar with these concepts.

1602
01:32:52.400 --> 01:32:56.160
And what the Nazis did is
they upended all of that,


1603
01:32:56.240 --> 01:32:59.960
and they said it's okay to
steal, it's okay to lie,


1604
01:33:00.040 --> 01:33:01.760
and it's fine to murder.

1605
01:33:01.840 --> 01:33:04.280
And they legislated for all of that.

1606
01:33:04.360 --> 01:33:06.800
So they reversed the 10 Commandments.

1607
01:33:06.880 --> 01:33:10.200
They gave their victims
no recourse to law.


1608
01:33:10.280 --> 01:33:12.440
There was no due process.

1609
01:33:12.520 --> 01:33:14.960
And that's why it's so important that

1610
01:33:15.040 --> 01:33:20.080
when we look at how we
approach Nazi war criminals,


1611
01:33:20.160 --> 01:33:24.120
we apply to them the
justice and the rule of law


1612
01:33:24.200 --> 01:33:26.480
that they denied to their victims.

1613
01:33:29.680 --> 01:33:32.480
Herberts Cukurs,
"The Butcher of Riga,"


1614
01:33:32.560 --> 01:33:35.720
was a pre-war aviator and national hero

1615
01:33:35.800 --> 01:33:38.520
who directly participated
in the mass murder


1616
01:33:38.600 --> 01:33:41.640
of over 30,000 Latvian Jews.

1617
01:33:41.720 --> 01:33:44.280
In one instance, in 1941,

1618
01:33:44.360 --> 01:33:46.640
he ordered an elderly Jewish man

1619
01:33:46.720 --> 01:33:48.880
to rape a young Jewish woman.

1620
01:33:48.960 --> 01:33:51.120
And any prisoners who looked away

1621
01:33:51.200 --> 01:33:53.840
were personally beaten to death by Cukurs.

1622
01:33:55.120 --> 01:33:57.480
He escaped to Brazil after the war

1623
01:33:57.560 --> 01:34:00.960
where the Soviets tried
unsuccessfully to extradite him.


1624
01:34:01.800 --> 01:34:05.040
He was assassinated by
Israeli Mossad agents


1625
01:34:05.120 --> 01:34:09.080
in Uruguay in 1965, aged 64.

1626
01:34:10.040 --> 01:34:13.080
In Latvia today, there
are those who insist


1627
01:34:13.160 --> 01:34:15.080
that he was totally innocent

1628
01:34:15.160 --> 01:34:17.360
despite the great many
eyewitness statements


1629
01:34:17.440 --> 01:34:19.120
about his crimes.

1630
01:34:19.200 --> 01:34:21.520
For them, he is still a hero.

1631
01:34:22.400 --> 01:34:27.040
A musical about him
premiered in Liepaja in 2014.


1632
01:34:35.920 --> 01:34:38.360
What do you know
about your grandmother?


1633
01:34:38.440 --> 01:34:40.800
- Her name was Ilse, Ilse Cohn.

1634
01:34:40.880 --> 01:34:42.760
She had just one child, my mother.

1635
01:34:43.880 --> 01:34:46.320
Her husband had died in

1636
01:34:46.400 --> 01:34:47.696
So there was just
the two of them left

1637
01:34:47.720 --> 01:34:48.800
as the war approached.

1638
01:34:49.800 --> 01:34:51.440
My mother got out, she got a visa

1639
01:34:51.520 --> 01:34:54.480
as a domestic servant to come to Britain.

1640
01:34:54.560 --> 01:34:56.760
But her mother, my grandmother, couldn't

1641
01:34:56.840 --> 01:35:00.320
because she was considered
to be too old, she was 42.


1642
01:35:00.400 --> 01:35:01.720
So she stayed behind.

1643
01:35:03.520 --> 01:35:05.160
So I'll read you what it says.

1644
01:35:05.240 --> 01:35:06.600
"This is the place where Nazis

1645
01:35:06.680 --> 01:35:10.400
"and their assistants
killed more than 30,000 Jews


1646
01:35:10.480 --> 01:35:13.520
"from Lithuania and other
European countries."


1647
01:35:13.600 --> 01:35:14.480
And among the people

1648
01:35:14.560 --> 01:35:17.040
from other European countries killed here

1649
01:35:17.120 --> 01:35:19.440
was my grandmother who was
brought here from Germany


1650
01:35:19.520 --> 01:35:21.160
from her hometown of Breslau.

1651
01:35:22.280 --> 01:35:25.400
The Nazis had invaded here
only a few months previously,


1652
01:35:25.480 --> 01:35:27.600
and this was one of their killing fields.

1653
01:35:27.680 --> 01:35:31.680
My grandmother was one of
the very first German Jews


1654
01:35:31.760 --> 01:35:35.280
to be deported, to be
killed on a site like this,


1655
01:35:35.360 --> 01:35:39.320
on that one day 2000 people
were killed here on this site.


1656
01:35:48.760 --> 01:35:50.880
This is one of the burial pits.

1657
01:35:50.960 --> 01:35:52.560
This is where the bodies fell.

1658
01:35:54.120 --> 01:35:56.920
And then in 1943-44,

1659
01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.520
they dug them all
up again and burnt them

1660
01:35:59.600 --> 01:36:02.240
because the Nazis wanted
to get rid of the evidence.


1661
01:36:02.320 --> 01:36:05.640
And you just look at the
size of a pit like this.


1662
01:36:06.560 --> 01:36:08.720
It defies the imagination.

1663
01:36:15.040 --> 01:36:17.520
They you are, says it all, four words.

1664
01:36:17.600 --> 01:36:22.600
"The way of death," English,
Hebrew, Russian, Lithuanian.


1665
01:36:30.280 --> 01:36:31.920
This is an extraordinary document.

1666
01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:35.200
This is a report that
was written by the man


1667
01:36:35.280 --> 01:36:37.280
who was in command of
the killing squads here,


1668
01:36:37.360 --> 01:36:39.640
a man called Colonel Karl Jãger.

1669
01:36:39.720 --> 01:36:42.560
And it's one of the very
few documents that survived


1670
01:36:42.640 --> 01:36:46.080
that actually spells
out in clinical detail


1671
01:36:46.160 --> 01:36:48.640
who was killed when, every day.

1672
01:36:48.720 --> 01:36:50.760
How many Jewish men,
how many Jewish women,


1673
01:36:50.840 --> 01:36:52.800
how many Jewish children were killed.

1674
01:36:52.880 --> 01:36:53.960
And he actually says,

1675
01:36:54.040 --> 01:36:57.360
"This is a complete tabulation
of executions carried out


1676
01:36:57.440 --> 01:36:59.480
"in the Einsatzkommando 3 zone

1677
01:36:59.560 --> 01:37:02.520
"up to the 1st of December, 1941."

1678
01:37:02.600 --> 01:37:05.520
And he specifies, "These
executions were carried out


1679
01:37:05.600 --> 01:37:08.240
"by Lithuanian partisans
on my instructions


1680
01:37:08.320 --> 01:37:10.640
"and under my command."

1681
01:37:10.720 --> 01:37:13.360
Let me just show
you this one page here.

1682
01:37:13.440 --> 01:37:15.960
29th of November, 1941.

1683
01:37:16.040 --> 01:37:18.160
693 Jewish men,

1684
01:37:18.240 --> 01:37:21.360
1,155 Jewish women,

1685
01:37:21.440 --> 01:37:26.120
152 children from Vienna and Breslau

1686
01:37:26.200 --> 01:37:28.120
killed on this one day.

1687
01:37:28.200 --> 01:37:31.360
And of course one of the 1100
women was my grandmother.


1688
01:37:33.680 --> 01:37:38.680
You go back a month earlier,

1689
01:37:40.040 --> 01:37:43.120
here on this site of one day.

1690
01:37:43.200 --> 01:37:46.160
These were Jews from the ghetto in Kaunas

1691
01:37:46.240 --> 01:37:48.320
who were marched up here and shot.

1692
01:37:48.400 --> 01:37:50.720
And of those 9,200, look at this.

1693
01:37:50.800 --> 01:37:54.560
4,273 were children.

1694
01:37:55.760 --> 01:38:00.760
Children who were shot here
at the Ninth Fort in Kaunas.


1695
01:38:01.160 --> 01:38:03.280
And you go to
the end of this report

1696
01:38:03.360 --> 01:38:05.960
and he tots up the total.

1697
01:38:06.040 --> 01:38:08.240
And the grand total, here it is, 137,346

1698
01:38:14.160 --> 01:38:15.480
in less than five months.

1699
01:38:22.040 --> 01:38:24.360
Well, this is a really
rather appalling place,


1700
01:38:24.440 --> 01:38:27.600
Paneriai Forest, where tens of thousands

1701
01:38:27.680 --> 01:38:32.440
of people were massacred
between 1941 and 1944.


1702
01:38:33.080 --> 01:38:36.720
The have a memorial stone
here in Lithuanian Hebrew,


1703
01:38:36.800 --> 01:38:38.800
Russian inscriptions.

1704
01:38:38.880 --> 01:38:39.640
But what's interesting is

1705
01:38:39.720 --> 01:38:43.760
that the original Soviet
narrative was that the people


1706
01:38:43.840 --> 01:38:47.440
who were slaughtered here
were Soviet citizens.


1707
01:38:47.520 --> 01:38:50.480
So it's quite interesting
how history gets rewritten


1708
01:38:50.560 --> 01:38:52.160
over a period of time.

1709
01:38:52.240 --> 01:38:54.000
What this says is that originally,

1710
01:38:54.080 --> 01:38:56.880
this memorial simply paid tribute

1711
01:38:56.960 --> 01:38:59.120
to the 100,000 Soviet people

1712
01:38:59.200 --> 01:39:01.920
who were slaughtered here in the forest.

1713
01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.720
Then in 1989, on the initiative,

1714
01:39:04.800 --> 01:39:08.040
it says of the Lithuanian
Jewish community,


1715
01:39:08.120 --> 01:39:10.920
one of these granite stones was inserted

1716
01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.360
to make it clear that 70,000

1717
01:39:13.440 --> 01:39:15.480
of the people killed here were Jews.

1718
01:39:15.560 --> 01:39:18.800
And then again, in 2004,
another change was made.


1719
01:39:18.880 --> 01:39:22.280
The phrase "Soviet
citizens" was covered up


1720
01:39:22.360 --> 01:39:24.680
with a new plaque, just replacing it

1721
01:39:24.760 --> 01:39:29.160
by saying 100,000 people were killed here.

1722
01:39:29.240 --> 01:39:31.360
This is one of the burial pits

1723
01:39:31.440 --> 01:39:34.040
into which they threw the bodies

1724
01:39:34.120 --> 01:39:36.880
of all the people who were killed here.

1725
01:39:39.360 --> 01:39:40.800
"For the Germans,

1726
01:39:40.880 --> 01:39:44.880
"300 Jews are 300 enemies of humanity.

1727
01:39:44.960 --> 01:39:47.160
"For the Lithuanians,

1728
01:39:47.240 --> 01:39:52.240
"300 Jews are 300 pairs of
shoes, trousers, and clothes."


1729
01:39:53.320 --> 01:39:57.160
Kazimierz Sakowicz,
journalist and witness.


1730
01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:00.960
- The numbers are so huge,

1731
01:40:01.040 --> 01:40:03.160
it's so difficult to
come to terms with it,


1732
01:40:03.240 --> 01:40:05.360
to imagine that these were real people.

1733
01:40:05.440 --> 01:40:08.400
What makes this place so special is

1734
01:40:08.480 --> 01:40:09.840
that there are photographs

1735
01:40:09.920 --> 01:40:12.960
of what happened here on the dunes,

1736
01:40:13.040 --> 01:40:15.800
on the edge of these huge
ditches that had been dug.


1737
01:40:16.680 --> 01:40:19.280
So their bodies just fell
straight into the ditches.


1738
01:40:20.520 --> 01:40:22.480
German officers took the photographs,

1739
01:40:22.560 --> 01:40:26.840
presumably as some kind
of grotesque souvenir,


1740
01:40:26.920 --> 01:40:28.200
and then at the end of the war,

1741
01:40:28.280 --> 01:40:30.600
they fell into the hands
of Russian authorities


1742
01:40:30.680 --> 01:40:31.976
and they were handed over and used

1743
01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:35.040
in evidence at the
Nuremberg war crimes trials.


1744
01:40:37.280 --> 01:40:39.120
These are the photographs
that were taken here,


1745
01:40:39.200 --> 01:40:41.760
right here on the beach in December, 1941.

1746
01:40:41.840 --> 01:40:44.440
And you can see the people huddling

1747
01:40:44.520 --> 01:40:46.920
under the guard of the German officers.

1748
01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:48.536
- Yeah, and you can
see how cold it is,

1749
01:40:48.560 --> 01:40:50.096
look at their thick coats.
- Absolutely,


1750
01:40:50.120 --> 01:40:51.600
this was December.

1751
01:40:51.680 --> 01:40:53.600
And has anybody
been identified from them?


1752
01:40:53.680 --> 01:40:56.120
- Yeah, some of them have
actually been identified by name.


1753
01:40:56.200 --> 01:40:57.360
I mean, you can see the faces

1754
01:40:57.440 --> 01:41:00.280
and that's what makes it so real.

1755
01:41:14.480 --> 01:41:15.960
And then you look,

1756
01:41:16.040 --> 01:41:18.080
they were made to take
their clothes off, taking...


1757
01:41:18.160 --> 01:41:18.960
- And look at all the guards.

1758
01:41:19.040 --> 01:41:19.800
- Look at all the guards, yeah.

1759
01:41:19.880 --> 01:41:21.440
- There's lots, why are there so many?

1760
01:41:21.520 --> 01:41:22.936
- Do you know, some of
them came here actually


1761
01:41:22.960 --> 01:41:25.880
to watch what's called execution tourism.

1762
01:41:25.960 --> 01:41:27.600
I mean it's obscene,

1763
01:41:27.680 --> 01:41:29.680
fit like sort of public executions today

1764
01:41:29.760 --> 01:41:32.040
in Iran or in Saudi Arabia.

1765
01:41:32.120 --> 01:41:35.120
- He's got a, some kind
of a list of people.


1766
01:41:35.200 --> 01:41:37.760
- Yes, exactly, exactly, a list of people.

1767
01:41:39.080 --> 01:41:42.960
And worse and worse, worse and worse.

1768
01:41:43.040 --> 01:41:46.200
- So in this one, all
of them are very young.


1769
01:41:46.280 --> 01:41:48.720
She's 17 or 18.
- In her teens, yeah, yeah.


1770
01:41:48.800 --> 01:41:50.880
- They're totally naked,
and they're running.


1771
01:41:50.960 --> 01:41:52.720
You can see she's running, she's running.

1772
01:41:52.800 --> 01:41:54.160
It's like they're doing it

1773
01:41:54.240 --> 01:41:56.640
for some extraordinary titillation...

1774
01:41:56.720 --> 01:41:58.616
- That they are being made
to humiliate themselves.


1775
01:41:58.640 --> 01:41:59.960
- Of the people who killed them.

1776
01:42:00.040 --> 01:42:00.800
- Exactly.
- I mean they,


1777
01:42:00.880 --> 01:42:02.336
because they're all young,
they're getting off on it.


1778
01:42:02.360 --> 01:42:04.520
And then, and then
they're gonna kill them.


1779
01:42:04.600 --> 01:42:05.720
- Totally obscene.

1780
01:42:07.320 --> 01:42:08.320
And then,

1781
01:42:09.480 --> 01:42:12.360
this is literally moments
before they're shot.


1782
01:42:12.440 --> 01:42:14.560
- So let's have a
look at this, this is,

1783
01:42:14.640 --> 01:42:15.480
so there's that edge, so...
- They're looking out


1784
01:42:15.560 --> 01:42:17.040
over the sea, aren't they?

1785
01:42:17.120 --> 01:42:19.080
Almost exactly on this spot, I thought.

1786
01:42:20.160 --> 01:42:20.920
- So what's the next...

1787
01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.600
- And then the next, oh,
it's, and this, I mean...


1788
01:42:23.680 --> 01:42:25.136
- Oh, God, that's them dead.
- Do you know what's


1789
01:42:25.160 --> 01:42:26.160
happening here?

1790
01:42:26.240 --> 01:42:28.400
This is a guy who walks along

1791
01:42:28.480 --> 01:42:29.680
and he kicks the bodies,

1792
01:42:29.760 --> 01:42:32.360
those who hadn't fallen at
the moment of their death.


1793
01:42:32.440 --> 01:42:34.440
He goes on, he's called the kicker.

1794
01:42:34.520 --> 01:42:35.560
- The kicker.
- The kicker.


1795
01:42:39.600 --> 01:42:40.640
There are hundreds.

1796
01:42:40.720 --> 01:42:42.480
- Exactly.
- They're all...


1797
01:42:42.560 --> 01:42:44.680
- Under our feet.
- Buried here.


1798
01:42:51.680 --> 01:42:54.960
Over 200,000 Jews were killed
in the Baltic countries


1799
01:42:55.040 --> 01:42:58.480
of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia.

1800
01:42:58.560 --> 01:43:01.480
In each country, the
Einsatzgruppen were helped


1801
01:43:01.560 --> 01:43:03.480
by willing local citizens.

1802
01:43:07.160 --> 01:43:10.200
Almost all of those who
enthusiastically played


1803
01:43:10.280 --> 01:43:13.280
their murderous part
were never prosecuted.


1804
01:43:14.960 --> 01:43:17.920
They were never even questioned.

1805
01:43:40.040 --> 01:43:41.360
In 1945,

1806
01:43:41.440 --> 01:43:43.680
after killing Robin Lustig's grandmother

1807
01:43:43.760 --> 01:43:48.480
and the other 137,000 Jews in Lithuania,

1808
01:43:48.560 --> 01:43:52.840
former SS Officer Karl Jãger
returned to live in Germany.


1809
01:43:53.720 --> 01:43:56.720
All the time, he used his real name.

1810
01:43:57.560 --> 01:44:00.960
He was eventually arrested in March, 1959

1811
01:44:01.040 --> 01:44:03.440
after 14 years of freedom.

1812
01:44:18.040 --> 01:44:21.960
- One of the earliest cases
of the Central Office,


1813
01:44:22.040 --> 01:44:24.440
The Central Office had been established

1814
01:44:24.520 --> 01:44:27.800
on December 1st, 1958

1815
01:44:27.880 --> 01:44:30.840
and the 14th case

1816
01:44:30.920 --> 01:44:34.960
is the case against Karl Jãger.

1817
01:44:35.040 --> 01:44:37.400
That's one of our index cards.

1818
01:44:37.480 --> 01:44:41.280
You can see he was responsible

1819
01:44:41.360 --> 01:44:44.720
for the Einsatzkommando 3

1820
01:44:44.800 --> 01:44:49.000
within the task force A in Lithuania.

1821
01:44:49.080 --> 01:44:52.680
And what you can
see here is the evidence

1822
01:44:52.760 --> 01:44:57.520
against his deeds with Jews killed.

1823
01:44:57.600 --> 01:45:01.800
And what you can see is
that he was in prison


1824
01:45:01.880 --> 01:45:04.320
and then he committed suicide

1825
01:45:04.400 --> 01:45:08.480
by hanging himself in
the night in June, 1959.


1826
01:45:10.600 --> 01:45:15.600
We have seen that a lot of
Nazi criminals, war criminals,


1827
01:45:16.160 --> 01:45:20.920
have committed suicide just
to avoid being convicted.


1828
01:45:34.920 --> 01:45:38.040
All these boxes,
how many boxes in total?


1829
01:45:38.120 --> 01:45:41.320
- It's about 50,000.

1830
01:45:42.320 --> 01:45:47.320
And altogether, it's dealing
with this criminal past,


1831
01:45:47.520 --> 01:45:50.440
what has been done, what was not possible,

1832
01:45:50.520 --> 01:45:55.520
what has been overlooked
over political constraints


1833
01:45:55.800 --> 01:45:58.520
in investigating these crimes.

1834
01:45:58.600 --> 01:46:01.600
All that is here in these boxes.

1835
01:46:01.680 --> 01:46:05.280
And all together, we have here 7,600 cases

1836
01:46:05.360 --> 01:46:08.360
since 1958, here in this room.

1837
01:46:10.760 --> 01:46:12.640
This is the Central Office

1838
01:46:12.720 --> 01:46:15.800
for the Investigation of
National Socialist Crimes


1839
01:46:15.880 --> 01:46:19.160
and our task is to prepare cases

1840
01:46:19.240 --> 01:46:23.720
before German public
prosecutors' offices and courts


1841
01:46:23.800 --> 01:46:27.080
when it comes to murders
committed by Nazi criminals.


1842
01:46:28.160 --> 01:46:29.720
In the mid of the '50s,

1843
01:46:29.800 --> 01:46:32.800
there was a trial
in the city of Ulm,

1844
01:46:32.880 --> 01:46:36.520
which is really nearby
here from Ludwigsburg,


1845
01:46:36.600 --> 01:46:39.200
as Einsatzgruppen trial.

1846
01:46:39.280 --> 01:46:44.240
And this trial made two
things obvious for the public.


1847
01:46:44.320 --> 01:46:47.880
There are still a lot of
crimes not yet investigated


1848
01:46:47.960 --> 01:46:52.080
or properly investigated
by German authorities.


1849
01:46:52.160 --> 01:46:54.720
And we need a central institution.

1850
01:46:54.800 --> 01:46:58.160
We can't leave it to
the public prosecutors


1851
01:46:58.240 --> 01:47:01.280
or courts that are only responsible

1852
01:47:01.360 --> 01:47:04.520
for crimes committed in their area

1853
01:47:04.600 --> 01:47:06.920
or for defendants living there.

1854
01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:12.000
So this procedural system
was not fit for mass crimes


1855
01:47:12.440 --> 01:47:15.760
that had been committed
outside of Western Germany.


1856
01:47:18.200 --> 01:47:22.840
The idea is to deal with all
national socialist crimes


1857
01:47:22.920 --> 01:47:27.240
that had been committed
in Europe or North Africa.


1858
01:47:27.320 --> 01:47:30.000
So where German troops had been,

1859
01:47:30.080 --> 01:47:31.840
that's the scene of the crime.

1860
01:47:31.920 --> 01:47:34.200
And then the next step is to look

1861
01:47:34.280 --> 01:47:37.920
where are the people
responsible for these crimes?


1862
01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:39.640
And of course, after the war,

1863
01:47:39.720 --> 01:47:44.720
they were not only in Germany,
but all over the world.


1864
01:47:45.040 --> 01:47:48.120
And so we took steps to make sure

1865
01:47:48.200 --> 01:47:51.400
to find the whereabouts of these people.

1866
01:47:53.480 --> 01:47:55.560
The Ludwigsburg
office was involved


1867
01:47:55.640 --> 01:47:59.560
with the 16-month Sobibor trial in 1965.

1868
01:48:00.680 --> 01:48:03.520
Alfred Ittner was sentenced
to just four years


1869
01:48:03.600 --> 01:48:05.040
for participating in the murder

1870
01:48:05.120 --> 01:48:07.880
of approximately 68,000 Jews.

1871
01:48:10.400 --> 01:48:13.080
Erich Fuchs was sentenced to four years

1872
01:48:13.160 --> 01:48:17.320
for participating in the
murder of at least 79,000 Jews.


1873
01:48:19.320 --> 01:48:22.120
Franz Wolf was sentenced to eight years

1874
01:48:22.200 --> 01:48:24.000
for participating in the mass murder

1875
01:48:24.080 --> 01:48:26.600
of at least 39,000 Jews.

1876
01:48:29.040 --> 01:48:31.040
Six other defendants charged

1877
01:48:31.120 --> 01:48:34.520
with the same crimes were acquitted.

1878
01:48:37.880 --> 01:48:39.560
- A lot of evidence, of course,

1879
01:48:39.640 --> 01:48:41.440
was not accessible for us

1880
01:48:41.520 --> 01:48:44.440
because most of the crime scenes were

1881
01:48:44.520 --> 01:48:49.520
behind the Iron Curtain and
a lot of documents had fallen


1882
01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:53.120
in the hands of the Red
Army and were now in Moscow


1883
01:48:53.200 --> 01:48:55.400
or in Minsk and other cities,

1884
01:48:55.480 --> 01:48:59.720
and during the Cold
War, really hard to get.


1885
01:48:59.800 --> 01:49:00.720
Also in the beginning,

1886
01:49:00.800 --> 01:49:02.400
there were a lot of difficulties

1887
01:49:02.480 --> 01:49:07.200
in recruiting adequate personnel
for the Central Office.


1888
01:49:07.280 --> 01:49:10.920
And adequate means people
that are really fit


1889
01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.560
and eager to deal with these crimes.

1890
01:49:13.640 --> 01:49:15.920
And it's true that in the beginning,

1891
01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:19.680
lots of public prosecutors,

1892
01:49:19.760 --> 01:49:23.560
police officers, and even judges in office

1893
01:49:23.640 --> 01:49:26.880
in the Federal Republic had been

1894
01:49:26.960 --> 01:49:30.640
in the same office already
during the Third Reich.


1895
01:49:32.360 --> 01:49:34.920
- In 1958, the Ludwigsburg Institute meant

1896
01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:39.360
that you could do
federally-coordinated investigations


1897
01:49:39.440 --> 01:49:43.600
of Nazi crimes, and
that assisted massively


1898
01:49:43.680 --> 01:49:47.640
in acquiring evidence and
coordinating investigations


1899
01:49:47.720 --> 01:49:49.560
and spreading the net much wider.

1900
01:49:49.640 --> 01:49:51.480
But it only had a fairly small staff.

1901
01:49:51.560 --> 01:49:53.720
So even that was relatively limited.

1902
01:49:54.880 --> 01:49:58.080
But the other thing that
changed in the late 1950s,


1903
01:49:58.160 --> 01:50:02.320
early 1960s, was the
significance of the Cold War.


1904
01:50:02.400 --> 01:50:04.840
Now there is this real competition

1905
01:50:04.920 --> 01:50:07.080
between East Germany and West Germany,

1906
01:50:07.160 --> 01:50:09.560
a competition between the two regimes

1907
01:50:09.640 --> 01:50:13.480
and East Germany, as part
of this new Cold War era,


1908
01:50:13.560 --> 01:50:16.200
starts criticizing West Germany

1909
01:50:16.280 --> 01:50:19.120
for having former Nazis in high places,

1910
01:50:19.200 --> 01:50:21.360
pointing to those big Nazis

1911
01:50:21.440 --> 01:50:23.640
who are in Adenauer's own government.

1912
01:50:23.720 --> 01:50:27.160
So the first federal
chancellor of West Germany,


1913
01:50:27.240 --> 01:50:31.040
Konrad Adenauer, included
in his government people


1914
01:50:31.120 --> 01:50:34.800
who had played a significant
role under Nazism.


1915
01:50:34.880 --> 01:50:37.960
Hans Globke, his chief
aide in his chancellery,


1916
01:50:38.040 --> 01:50:40.480
was the guy who had written
the official commentary


1917
01:50:40.560 --> 01:50:42.840
on the Nuremberg laws for Hitler.

1918
01:50:42.920 --> 01:50:44.560
Theodor Oberlãnder,

1919
01:50:44.640 --> 01:50:46.400
who was his minister for refugees

1920
01:50:46.480 --> 01:50:48.360
and expellees from Eastern Europe,

1921
01:50:48.440 --> 01:50:50.576
knew all about Eastern Europe
because they'd been out there


1922
01:50:50.600 --> 01:50:53.600
in the war alongside the Einsatzgruppen,

1923
01:50:53.680 --> 01:50:55.200
alongside the killing squads,

1924
01:50:55.280 --> 01:50:59.040
trying to deal with
racial reconfigurations


1925
01:50:59.120 --> 01:51:00.960
during the Holocaust.

1926
01:51:01.040 --> 01:51:03.960
So East Germany starts pointing the finger

1927
01:51:04.040 --> 01:51:06.000
at people in high places in West Germany.

1928
01:51:06.080 --> 01:51:08.400
This is embarrassing for West Germany.

1929
01:51:08.480 --> 01:51:10.800
So they want to show that actually,

1930
01:51:10.880 --> 01:51:14.720
they are genuinely dealing
with the Nazi past.


1931
01:51:14.800 --> 01:51:17.360
However, I think it's really crucial here

1932
01:51:17.440 --> 01:51:21.720
to say it's not West Germany
putting Nazis on trial.


1933
01:51:21.800 --> 01:51:25.080
It's a few key individuals.

1934
01:51:25.160 --> 01:51:27.760
Very significant here is Fritz Bauer,

1935
01:51:27.840 --> 01:51:30.600
the attorney general
of the land of Hessen,


1936
01:51:30.680 --> 01:51:33.400
who is socialist and Jewish,

1937
01:51:33.480 --> 01:51:35.200
and had to go into exile

1938
01:51:35.280 --> 01:51:37.720
to save his own life
during the Third Reich.


1939
01:51:37.800 --> 01:51:41.960
He comes back and he's determined
to prosecute former Nazis.


1940
01:51:42.040 --> 01:51:44.480
But I think it's very,
very important to point out


1941
01:51:44.560 --> 01:51:48.040
that he did this against
incredible opposition


1942
01:51:48.120 --> 01:51:50.040
in high places, in the government,

1943
01:51:50.120 --> 01:51:53.120
in the political and elite circles.

1944
01:51:53.200 --> 01:51:55.280
And it was Fritz Bauer who was determined

1945
01:51:55.360 --> 01:51:57.000
to put Auschwitz on trial.

1946
01:51:57.080 --> 01:51:59.440
And it was Fritz Bauer
who gave the tip-off


1947
01:51:59.520 --> 01:52:02.600
to Mossad about Eichmann's whereabouts,

1948
01:52:02.680 --> 01:52:06.720
so that it would be the
Mossad who kidnapped Eichmann


1949
01:52:06.800 --> 01:52:09.840
and took him to Jerusalem to
put him on trial in Israel


1950
01:52:09.920 --> 01:52:12.840
because Fritz Bauer said if
Eichmann came back to Germany,


1951
01:52:12.920 --> 01:52:15.200
he would not get the kind of trial

1952
01:52:15.280 --> 01:52:17.800
and conviction that he deserved.

1953
01:52:22.360 --> 01:52:24.520
Adolf Eichmann
was a key executioner


1954
01:52:24.600 --> 01:52:28.080
of the Nazis extermination program.

1955
01:52:28.160 --> 01:52:32.440
After the war, he escaped to
Argentina via the Ratlines,


1956
01:52:32.520 --> 01:52:36.840
finding work as a department
head with Mercedes-Benz,


1957
01:52:36.920 --> 01:52:40.920
a company that, with the use
of 40,000 slave laborers,


1958
01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:43.440
had become rich under the Nazis.

1959
01:52:45.280 --> 01:52:48.640
He was tracked
down in 1960 by Mossad agents


1960
01:52:48.720 --> 01:52:50.720
and taken to Jerusalem for trial.

1961
01:52:51.960 --> 01:52:56.640
His defense of only following
orders was rejected.


1962
01:52:56.720 --> 01:53:00.560
He was found guilty and executed in 1962.

1963
01:53:08.400 --> 01:53:10.600
- Eichmann should be here.

1964
01:53:12.760 --> 01:53:15.160
Eichmann.

1965
01:53:15.240 --> 01:53:16.880
- So many people.

1966
01:53:16.960 --> 01:53:18.280
- Yeah, we have more than

1967
01:53:18.360 --> 01:53:22.200
720,000 names here.

1968
01:53:22.280 --> 01:53:24.680
- 720,000 names.

1969
01:53:24.760 --> 01:53:27.320
- But not only defendant suspects,

1970
01:53:27.400 --> 01:53:32.400
but also witnesses that
are mentioned in the files.


1971
01:53:33.160 --> 01:53:35.640
That's really important
in order to make sure


1972
01:53:35.720 --> 01:53:40.720
that to put it to back
at the exact same spot.


1973
01:53:40.960 --> 01:53:43.920
An index card would look like

1974
01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.680
that, we have information concerning

1975
01:53:48.840 --> 01:53:52.280
the person, name, date of birth,

1976
01:53:52.360 --> 01:53:56.160
his rank as SS
-Obersturmbannführer.

1977
01:53:57.320 --> 01:54:00.280
We had here the information
that he was arrested


1978
01:54:00.360 --> 01:54:04.760
by Israel agents in Argentina in 1960,

1979
01:54:06.640 --> 01:54:11.640
than the result of the trial in Israel.

1980
01:54:11.960 --> 01:54:13.680
- In the case with the Israelis,

1981
01:54:13.760 --> 01:54:17.400
because they snatched him
in a very controversial way,


1982
01:54:18.800 --> 01:54:22.440
did you help them, in any
case, preparing their evidence,


1983
01:54:22.520 --> 01:54:25.480
or did you step back
and leave it to them?

1984
01:54:25.560 --> 01:54:30.000
- The exchange of evidence
or legal assistance


1985
01:54:30.080 --> 01:54:33.800
was between the Public
Prosecutor's Office in Frankfurt,


1986
01:54:33.880 --> 01:54:36.360
Fritz Bauer, and Israel.

1987
01:54:36.440 --> 01:54:40.520
What we did was to send
an observer to the trial


1988
01:54:40.600 --> 01:54:43.240
in order to make sure that evidence

1989
01:54:43.320 --> 01:54:47.920
that is presented to the
court could find its way


1990
01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.480
in our investigations here.

1991
01:54:50.560 --> 01:54:52.880
And it's really valuable up to today,

1992
01:54:52.960 --> 01:54:54.440
not when it comes to Eichmann,

1993
01:54:54.520 --> 01:54:59.520
but when we look into
concentration camp cases today,


1994
01:54:59.720 --> 01:55:03.160
of course, we use the information

1995
01:55:03.240 --> 01:55:06.160
that have been established
here or before courts


1996
01:55:06.240 --> 01:55:10.080
in the '60s and '70s when it
comes to the crime itself.


1997
01:55:10.160 --> 01:55:12.120
What has happened in that camp,

1998
01:55:12.200 --> 01:55:14.640
how was the organization working,

1999
01:55:14.720 --> 01:55:16.240
who was responsible for what?

2000
01:55:22.400 --> 01:55:26.840
In German law, there's
no crime against humanity.


2001
01:55:26.920 --> 01:55:27.920
Why is that?

2002
01:55:28.840 --> 01:55:31.920
- Well, the notion,
crime against humanity,


2003
01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:33.880
from a legal point of view,

2004
01:55:33.960 --> 01:55:38.160
was invented in August, 1945

2005
01:55:39.120 --> 01:55:41.960
for the Nuremberg trial.

2006
01:55:42.040 --> 01:55:43.920
And there was a lot of reluctance

2007
01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:48.360
in Western Germany with that trial,

2008
01:55:49.880 --> 01:55:53.400
because of a lot of arguments.

2009
01:55:53.480 --> 01:55:56.520
A political argument was victor's justice,

2010
01:55:56.600 --> 01:55:58.800
the winners of the war,

2011
01:55:58.880 --> 01:56:01.840
only dealing with the crimes committed

2012
01:56:01.920 --> 01:56:04.320
by those who had lost the war.

2013
01:56:04.400 --> 01:56:06.440
And there's a legal argument.

2014
01:56:06.520 --> 01:56:08.360
Since the provisions

2015
01:56:09.320 --> 01:56:13.000
were made in August, 1945,

2016
01:56:13.880 --> 01:56:18.200
after the crime had been
committed until May '45,


2017
01:56:19.520 --> 01:56:23.240
that these provisions are

2018
01:56:23.320 --> 01:56:25.440
not legally correct

2019
01:56:25.520 --> 01:56:28.800
because they were applied retroactively.

2020
01:56:28.880 --> 01:56:32.520
And there's a common principle,
nulla poena sine lege,


2021
01:56:32.600 --> 01:56:35.040
that you should not apply criminal law

2022
01:56:35.120 --> 01:56:37.720
retroactively to the act.

2023
01:56:37.800 --> 01:56:42.840
So the German approach
was, "Let's take the code,


2024
01:56:42.920 --> 01:56:45.680
"the law that was applicable

2025
01:56:45.760 --> 01:56:49.880
"during the crimes up to May, 1945."

2026
01:56:51.400 --> 01:56:54.240
And in that code, we only find notions

2027
01:56:54.320 --> 01:56:57.600
like manslaughter or murder.

2028
01:56:57.680 --> 01:56:59.280
But we do not find notions

2029
01:56:59.360 --> 01:57:02.640
like crimes against humanity or genocide.

2030
01:57:02.720 --> 01:57:06.920
We have to prove a certain contribution

2031
01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:09.720
to a specific killing in order

2032
01:57:09.800 --> 01:57:14.040
to establish individual
responsibility or guilt.


2033
01:57:16.480 --> 01:57:19.160
- In 1979, the Americans created

2034
01:57:19.240 --> 01:57:21.480
the US Department of Justice Office

2035
01:57:21.560 --> 01:57:23.280
of Special Investigations,

2036
01:57:23.360 --> 01:57:26.040
headed for many years by Eli Rosenbaum

2037
01:57:26.120 --> 01:57:28.600
to track down Nazis in America.

2038
01:57:30.440 --> 01:57:32.760
In other countries, this
work was carried out


2039
01:57:32.840 --> 01:57:35.560
by individuals like Serge
and Beate Klarsfeld,


2040
01:57:35.640 --> 01:57:39.440
and most famous of all, 
Simon Wiesenthal.

2041
01:57:43.200 --> 01:57:45.960
Hermine Braunsteiner
was a German SS guard


2042
01:57:46.040 --> 01:57:49.080
who served at Ravensbrück and Majdanek.

2043
01:57:49.160 --> 01:57:50.440
She hanged some women

2044
01:57:50.520 --> 01:57:52.400
and others she killed with her whip.

2045
01:57:53.480 --> 01:57:54.800
She was imprisoned in Austria

2046
01:57:54.880 --> 01:57:56.880
for her activities in Ravensbrück,

2047
01:57:56.960 --> 01:57:59.360
but served just three years.

2048
01:58:00.200 --> 01:58:04.600
She went to the USA in 1959
and became an American citizen.


2049
01:58:05.720 --> 01:58:10.120
Simon Wiesenthal tracked
her down and in 1973,


2050
01:58:10.200 --> 01:58:13.280
she became the first Nazi
war criminal extradited


2051
01:58:13.360 --> 01:58:15.640
from the USA to West Germany.

2052
01:58:16.840 --> 01:58:19.280
Following a long complex trial,

2053
01:58:19.360 --> 01:58:23.440
she was sentenced in

2054
01:58:23.520 --> 01:58:27.040
and died in 1999, aged 79.

2055
01:58:29.120 --> 01:58:32.800
- When you look
at the West German cases

2056
01:58:32.880 --> 01:58:35.880
for most of the latter
half of the 20th century,


2057
01:58:35.960 --> 01:58:37.800
what's important is finding out

2058
01:58:37.880 --> 01:58:41.800
what the subjective intention
of the perpetrator was.


2059
01:58:41.880 --> 01:58:45.600
You generally needed
eyewitness testimony to say,


2060
01:58:45.680 --> 01:58:48.760
"I saw this man acting
with excess brutality,


2061
01:58:48.840 --> 01:58:53.760
"sadistic intent," or, "he was
very viciously anti-Semitic."


2062
01:58:53.840 --> 01:58:55.760
And to have eyewitness testimony,

2063
01:58:55.840 --> 01:58:58.040
you had to bring survivors to court.

2064
01:58:58.120 --> 01:59:01.120
And many of the survivors
who had the courage


2065
01:59:01.200 --> 01:59:04.200
to appear in court then
found they were mocked,


2066
01:59:04.280 --> 01:59:05.960
humiliated, vilified.

2067
01:59:06.040 --> 01:59:08.560
They had to face up to
their former tormentors


2068
01:59:08.640 --> 01:59:10.480
and then see their tormentors go free

2069
01:59:10.560 --> 01:59:12.520
or come away with lenient sentences.

2070
01:59:12.600 --> 01:59:14.760
Whereas they had just
had to relive everything


2071
01:59:14.840 --> 01:59:17.520
and then had been humiliated and told

2072
01:59:17.600 --> 01:59:18.976
that they were not telling the truth,

2073
01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:20.576
that they didn't have accurate memories,

2074
01:59:20.600 --> 01:59:22.720
that they couldn't say
the date or the time.


2075
01:59:22.800 --> 01:59:26.160
And so this dependence

2076
01:59:26.240 --> 01:59:29.040
on proving subjective intent,

2077
01:59:29.120 --> 01:59:30.920
if you murder efficiently,

2078
01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:34.480
means perpetrators get away
with murder, they really do.


2079
01:59:34.560 --> 01:59:39.120
It is not murder to put 300,000
people into the gas chambers


2080
01:59:39.200 --> 01:59:42.480
if you didn't actually
individually intend to brutally


2081
01:59:42.560 --> 01:59:45.320
and sadistically murder
a single individual.


2082
01:59:48.840 --> 01:59:50.920
How many people
have you investigated


2083
01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:54.720
and how many have been
prosecuted or convicted?


2084
01:59:54.800 --> 01:59:56.840
- The Central Office has led

2085
01:59:56.920 --> 02:00:00.840
7,600 investigations here

2086
02:00:00.920 --> 02:00:03.840
dealing with such complexes.

2087
02:00:03.920 --> 02:00:08.600
In that time, we had more
than 120,000 defendants


2088
02:00:08.680 --> 02:00:12.160
in Western Germany
whose cases were linked,


2089
02:00:12.240 --> 02:00:15.560
more or less, to the Central Office.

2090
02:00:15.640 --> 02:00:17.360
When it comes to convictions,

2091
02:00:17.440 --> 02:00:19.880
we have less than 7,000

2092
02:00:21.560 --> 02:00:23.640
at the end, in all

2093
02:00:24.520 --> 02:00:27.280
courts in Western Germany after the war.

2094
02:00:27.360 --> 02:00:30.400
So you see, there
were a lot of effort

2095
02:00:30.480 --> 02:00:33.080
when it comes to investigations,
looking into people.


2096
02:00:33.160 --> 02:00:36.520
But when it comes to
the results as verdicts,


2097
02:00:36.600 --> 02:00:38.600
we have less than 7,000.

2098
02:00:41.840 --> 02:00:44.760
After the war,
one of Auschwitz's most brutal


2099
02:00:44.840 --> 02:00:48.040
and sadistic guards, 
Gottfried Weise,

2100
02:00:48.120 --> 02:00:51.000
worked as a construction
manager in Germany


2101
02:00:51.080 --> 02:00:55.120
under his own name, untroubled
by his past war crimes.


2102
02:00:56.560 --> 02:00:58.640
- Gottfried Weise was free,

2103
02:00:58.720 --> 02:01:03.760
living in his own town of
Solingen, for 40 years.


2104
02:01:04.720 --> 02:01:07.240
He'd been apparently denazified,

2105
02:01:07.320 --> 02:01:11.160
which meant he had to fill
in a form, which he did.


2106
02:01:11.240 --> 02:01:15.960
He filled in a form and
gave his service record,


2107
02:01:16.040 --> 02:01:21.040
but he left out his time in Auschwitz.

2108
02:01:21.880 --> 02:01:24.000
So it was never found out.

2109
02:01:24.080 --> 02:01:25.960
And that it was very
difficult to find him.


2110
02:01:26.040 --> 02:01:30.360
And it took 40 years for
him to be apprehended.


2111
02:01:30.440 --> 02:01:32.440
But it was a prolonged
trial, don't forget,


2112
02:01:32.520 --> 02:01:34.960
because there were 60 witnesses

2113
02:01:35.040 --> 02:01:36.880
and they all came
from all over the world.

2114
02:01:36.960 --> 02:01:40.920
And in parts, the court
went to meet the witnesses.


2115
02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:44.160
So it was a really lengthy procedure.

2116
02:01:44.240 --> 02:01:48.840
Eventually, he was actually
charged with six murders


2117
02:01:48.920 --> 02:01:51.360
and convicted of five

2118
02:01:52.680 --> 02:01:54.640
specific murders, these were,

2119
02:01:54.720 --> 02:01:58.000
where people were actually
there at that point,


2120
02:01:58.080 --> 02:02:01.080
and managed to have a time scale

2121
02:02:01.160 --> 02:02:02.840
and a date when it happened.

2122
02:02:02.920 --> 02:02:04.440
And that was quite difficult.

2123
02:02:07.560 --> 02:02:10.400
I was cross-examined

2124
02:02:10.480 --> 02:02:12.960
for the defense and for the prosecution

2125
02:02:13.040 --> 02:02:15.760
on two days for seven hours.

2126
02:02:15.840 --> 02:02:19.360
Seven hours I was interrogated.

2127
02:02:20.240 --> 02:02:23.960
In a most minute detail.

2128
02:02:24.040 --> 02:02:25.720
For instance, they wanted to know

2129
02:02:25.800 --> 02:02:27.720
the construction of the hut.

2130
02:02:27.800 --> 02:02:32.120
"Were the planks this way
or were they that way?"


2131
02:02:33.320 --> 02:02:35.360
This man was on bail

2132
02:02:36.560 --> 02:02:38.640
all the time during this trial.

2133
02:02:38.720 --> 02:02:40.640
He was allowed to live at home.

2134
02:02:40.720 --> 02:02:44.040
I think he was on house
arrest or something like that.


2135
02:02:44.120 --> 02:02:47.560
And then came the point of the verdict.

2136
02:02:47.640 --> 02:02:52.600
And as they called him for
the verdict, he disappeared.


2137
02:02:55.040 --> 02:02:56.560
Just like that.

2138
02:02:56.640 --> 02:03:00.840
And Interpol was searching
all over Europe for him.


2139
02:03:00.920 --> 02:03:03.960
And as fate would have it,

2140
02:03:04.040 --> 02:03:07.240
he fled to Switzerland,

2141
02:03:07.320 --> 02:03:10.760
and had a stroke while he was there

2142
02:03:10.840 --> 02:03:12.520
and was brought to the hospital

2143
02:03:12.600 --> 02:03:16.640
and his identity was
obviously found at that point.


2144
02:03:16.720 --> 02:03:18.720
And then Interpol and the police came

2145
02:03:18.800 --> 02:03:20.920
and brought him back to prison.

2146
02:03:24.520 --> 02:03:25.880
- I was born in Western Ukraine,

2147
02:03:25.960 --> 02:03:29.120
in a town called Volodymyr
-Volynskyi,

2148
02:03:29.200 --> 02:03:30.360
But in actual fact,

2149
02:03:30.440 --> 02:03:32.040
the Jewish people called it Ludmire

2150
02:03:32.120 --> 02:03:33.840
because it was such a Jewish town.

2151
02:03:33.920 --> 02:03:38.880
The majority of the people
in the town itself were Jews.


2152
02:03:40.680 --> 02:03:44.120
The Germans came into our town in 1942,

2153
02:03:44.200 --> 02:03:47.600
and then we had to leave our house.

2154
02:03:48.440 --> 02:03:51.440
And we were all ushered into a ghetto.

2155
02:03:51.520 --> 02:03:52.680
We lived in the ghetto.

2156
02:03:54.240 --> 02:03:56.680
There were 30 people from
the whole town that survived,


2157
02:03:56.760 --> 02:03:58.720
nine children, 30 people.

2158
02:03:58.800 --> 02:04:00.880
So 30 people
out of how many were...


2159
02:04:00.960 --> 02:04:02.760
- 25,000.

2160
02:04:02.840 --> 02:04:04.200
Yeah, they didn't take them

2161
02:04:04.280 --> 02:04:06.240
to concentration camps, they didn't.

2162
02:04:07.360 --> 02:04:08.560
In actual fact,

2163
02:04:09.520 --> 02:04:12.120
they took people away to

2164
02:04:13.040 --> 02:04:14.560
dig trenches.

2165
02:04:18.360 --> 02:04:20.600
And these trenches, they killed people.

2166
02:04:22.520 --> 02:04:24.720
They just lay down,

2167
02:04:24.800 --> 02:04:26.600
a layer of people, machine gun,

2168
02:04:26.680 --> 02:04:28.040
and layer of people, machine gun,

2169
02:04:28.120 --> 02:04:30.560
and layer people, machine gun.

2170
02:04:33.280 --> 02:04:35.160
His name was Westerheide

2171
02:04:35.240 --> 02:04:38.560
and Westerheide was in
charge of our ghetto.


2172
02:04:38.640 --> 02:04:42.480
Anna Altvater was Westerheide's secretary

2173
02:04:42.560 --> 02:04:44.560
and they both were murderers.

2174
02:04:44.640 --> 02:04:48.920
I mean they were
responsible for 25,000 Jews.


2175
02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:50.536
Anna Altvater would come in the ghetto,

2176
02:04:50.560 --> 02:04:52.960
and if there was a newly-born baby,

2177
02:04:53.040 --> 02:04:54.040
she would turn it

2178
02:04:55.960 --> 02:04:57.680
upside-down and tear it in pieces

2179
02:04:57.760 --> 02:04:59.960
and throw it in the gutter.

2180
02:05:00.040 --> 02:05:04.360
And she came back to Germany
and she was working...


2181
02:05:09.080 --> 02:05:12.000
For the council in charge of youths.

2182
02:05:12.080 --> 02:05:13.880
Can you imagine?

2183
02:05:13.960 --> 02:05:17.320
And Westerheide, he was living somewhere

2184
02:05:17.400 --> 02:05:19.040
on the Swiss border.

2185
02:05:20.480 --> 02:05:23.160
And there was a court case,

2186
02:05:23.240 --> 02:05:24.960
first, I think, in Bielefeld,

2187
02:05:25.040 --> 02:05:27.640
and then I went with my
mother the second time,


2188
02:05:27.720 --> 02:05:29.280
it was in Dortmund.

2189
02:05:29.360 --> 02:05:33.480
The questions that the judges were asking

2190
02:05:33.560 --> 02:05:34.720
were absolutely ridiculous.

2191
02:05:34.800 --> 02:05:37.680
"What time of the day was
it when he was shooting?"


2192
02:05:37.760 --> 02:05:41.600
"What time did," I mean,
we didn't have a watch.


2193
02:05:41.680 --> 02:05:45.680
The problem was the judges
were sympathetic to them.


2194
02:05:45.760 --> 02:05:47.040
And what was the verdict, then?

2195
02:05:47.120 --> 02:05:48.840
Not guilty.

2196
02:05:48.920 --> 02:05:51.440
Nothing happened to
them, lack of evidence.


2197
02:05:51.520 --> 02:05:53.520
And how many
people gave evidence?


2198
02:05:53.600 --> 02:05:55.456
- There weren't many because
there weren't many people.


2199
02:05:55.480 --> 02:05:56.240
But your mother gave evidence.

2200
02:05:56.320 --> 02:05:58.160
- Oh yes, because my
mother was to the end

2201
02:05:58.240 --> 02:06:02.480
and she spoke German and Polish
and all these languages now.


2202
02:06:04.760 --> 02:06:06.720
But what is interesting,

2203
02:06:06.800 --> 02:06:10.320
about a few months or years so earlier,

2204
02:06:10.400 --> 02:06:12.520
there was the first trial,

2205
02:06:12.600 --> 02:06:14.280
which was in Bielefeld,

2206
02:06:15.680 --> 02:06:18.160
and, I think it's Bielefeld,
I can't remember exactly name.


2207
02:06:18.240 --> 02:06:19.336
And I went to see the judge.

2208
02:06:19.360 --> 02:06:23.520
It was a youngish sort of
German guy, and I said to him,


2209
02:06:23.600 --> 02:06:26.400
"How could you let this man

2210
02:06:26.480 --> 02:06:28.680
"that had so much blood on his hand,

2211
02:06:28.760 --> 02:06:30.120
"how could you let him out

2212
02:06:30.200 --> 02:06:35.200
"and say that he's free and not guilty?"

2213
02:06:35.440 --> 02:06:37.240
So you know what, he turned round,

2214
02:06:37.320 --> 02:06:39.960
this is still, 
I remember, at that time,

2215
02:06:40.040 --> 02:06:42.320
that killing Jews was legal.

2216
02:06:44.880 --> 02:06:47.000
So that was
it, that, and do you know


2217
02:06:47.080 --> 02:06:49.200
what happened to the two of them?

2218
02:06:49.280 --> 02:06:51.400
- No, they went back to their home

2219
02:06:51.480 --> 02:06:53.720
and lived their life.

2220
02:06:53.800 --> 02:06:57.160
And probably, they would start another

2221
02:06:57.240 --> 02:06:59.160
holocaust if they could.

2222
02:07:02.360 --> 02:07:04.640
Johanna Altvater once entered

2223
02:07:04.720 --> 02:07:07.360
a small hospital full of sick children.

2224
02:07:07.440 --> 02:07:10.080
For no reason, she just
started throwing them


2225
02:07:10.160 --> 02:07:12.120
from a third-story window,

2226
02:07:12.200 --> 02:07:15.520
killing some and severely injuring others.

2227
02:07:15.600 --> 02:07:20.160
In both trials, in
1978 and again in 1982,

2228
02:07:20.240 --> 02:07:24.600
her defense was that she
was only a secretary.


2229
02:07:24.680 --> 02:07:26.960
She was acquitted both times.

2230
02:07:27.040 --> 02:07:31.920
She died in 2003, one week
before her 85th birthday.


2231
02:07:40.640 --> 02:07:44.560
- This is a memorial for the
Czechoslovak Paratroopers


2232
02:07:44.640 --> 02:07:48.000
who were responsible for
the Operation Anthropoid.


2233
02:07:56.360 --> 02:07:59.400
On May 27th, 1942,

2234
02:07:59.480 --> 02:08:02.640
Reinhard Heydrich, who
was Hitler's favorite,


2235
02:08:02.720 --> 02:08:05.280
he was one of the
highest-ranking Nazis officers


2236
02:08:05.360 --> 02:08:09.040
and one of the architects
of the Final Solution.


2237
02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:12.600
He was severely injured right here

2238
02:08:12.680 --> 02:08:15.560
in a botched assassination attempt.

2239
02:08:19.400 --> 02:08:20.920
Heydrich didn't die on the spot.

2240
02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:24.560
He died a week later
of sepsis on June 4th.


2241
02:08:42.920 --> 02:08:44.760
- Right now we are
standing in a really quiet


2242
02:08:44.840 --> 02:08:47.320
and peaceful place where

2243
02:08:47.400 --> 02:08:52.360
77 years ago stood a
village, village of Lidice.


2244
02:08:52.880 --> 02:08:57.280
And this village was razed
to the ground by Nazis


2245
02:08:57.360 --> 02:09:00.760
like a revenge for
Czechoslovakian soldiers


2246
02:09:00.840 --> 02:09:05.000
assassinating Reinhard
Heydrich in May, 1942.


2247
02:09:06.400 --> 02:09:09.960
The Gestapo needed to punish someone.

2248
02:09:10.040 --> 02:09:13.680
So on the ninth of the June,

2249
02:09:13.760 --> 02:09:16.680
the day of the Heydrich's
funeral in Berlin,


2250
02:09:16.760 --> 02:09:18.880
the German police came to Lidice.

2251
02:09:20.120 --> 02:09:22.880
173 men were shot,

2252
02:09:26.600 --> 02:09:29.240
the women were taken to Ravensbrück

2253
02:09:29.320 --> 02:09:31.400
concentration camp near Berlin,

2254
02:09:32.480 --> 02:09:36.520
and most of the children were
taken to Chełmno in Poland,


2255
02:09:36.600 --> 02:09:38.960
and these children were gassed.

2256
02:09:40.960 --> 02:09:42.840
After the murder of Lidice men,

2257
02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:46.480
the Nazis put explosives

2258
02:09:46.560 --> 02:09:48.440
and everything was razed to the ground

2259
02:09:48.520 --> 02:09:52.200
and nothing was supposed to stay here.

2260
02:09:52.280 --> 02:09:57.280
They wanted to release the
Lidice from maps, from history.


2261
02:09:58.680 --> 02:10:01.080
It was their propaganda
because they wanted


2262
02:10:01.160 --> 02:10:03.720
to show whole world what happened

2263
02:10:03.800 --> 02:10:07.120
if someone tried to attack Third Reich.

2264
02:10:09.600 --> 02:10:12.080
The people here didn't know

2265
02:10:12.160 --> 02:10:14.640
about the Czechoslovak soldiers.

2266
02:10:16.600 --> 02:10:19.360
This village was absolutely innocent.

2267
02:10:21.800 --> 02:10:25.800
After the war, from 500 people of Lidice,

2268
02:10:25.880 --> 02:10:30.880
only 143 women came back to Lidice

2269
02:10:31.160 --> 02:10:34.040
and only 17 children came back.

2270
02:10:40.720 --> 02:10:42.440
- This is a Baroque church,

2271
02:10:42.520 --> 02:10:45.920
it's called Cyril and Methodius Church,

2272
02:10:46.960 --> 02:10:50.520
and this is the place where
the Czechoslovak Paratroopers,


2273
02:10:50.600 --> 02:10:54.120
who were responsible for
the Operation Anthropoid,


2274
02:10:54.200 --> 02:10:55.720
this is where they were hiding.

2275
02:10:56.760 --> 02:10:59.040
Nazis performed a large investigation

2276
02:10:59.120 --> 02:11:00.880
after the assassination,

2277
02:11:00.960 --> 02:11:05.960
and they discovered them
here on June 18, 1942.


2278
02:11:06.400 --> 02:11:09.400
And it was like a six-hours gun fight.

2279
02:11:11.360 --> 02:11:14.800
Those Czechoslovak paratroopers
who were not shot by Nazis,


2280
02:11:14.880 --> 02:11:16.320
they committed suicide.

2281
02:11:16.400 --> 02:11:20.040
And the only one who could
have survived was Jan Kubiš,


2282
02:11:20.120 --> 02:11:23.560
but he bled out and died in
a hospital later that day.


2283
02:11:51.400 --> 02:11:54.400
Another village,
Ležáky, did have a connection


2284
02:11:54.480 --> 02:11:57.400
to the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich,

2285
02:11:57.480 --> 02:12:01.760
as it was used as a hiding
place for the paratroopers.


2286
02:12:01.840 --> 02:12:03.720
Apart from two children,

2287
02:12:03.800 --> 02:12:05.440
every inhabitant was murdered

2288
02:12:07.080 --> 02:12:10.000
and the entire hamlet
was razed to the ground.


2289
02:12:14.960 --> 02:12:16.256
So were all those who carried out

2290
02:12:16.280 --> 02:12:18.880
the murders captured and punished?

2291
02:12:18.960 --> 02:12:20.200
- No, of course not.

2292
02:12:20.280 --> 02:12:24.480
The most important of
them got their trials


2293
02:12:24.560 --> 02:12:28.560
and was executed, but some of them didn't.

2294
02:12:28.640 --> 02:12:30.720
For example, Max Rostock,

2295
02:12:30.800 --> 02:12:34.880
he was a chief of in Kladno.

2296
02:12:34.960 --> 02:12:39.120
He was sent to the death in 1951,

2297
02:12:39.200 --> 02:12:41.240
but communist president of Czechoslovakia,

2298
02:12:41.320 --> 02:12:46.240
Antonín Zápotocký, decided
not to execute him,


2299
02:12:46.320 --> 02:12:49.360
and he changed his punishment

2300
02:12:50.720 --> 02:12:53.480
to stay in prison till
the end of his life.


2301
02:12:53.560 --> 02:12:56.600
But in 1958,

2302
02:12:56.680 --> 02:13:01.080
the communist regime
decided to hire Max Rostock


2303
02:13:01.160 --> 02:13:03.920
to Czechoslovak intelligence service

2304
02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:08.880
because he was a experienced
secret agent, German.


2305
02:13:08.960 --> 02:13:13.240
So they hired him and sent
him to the West Germany.


2306
02:13:13.320 --> 02:13:15.440
His life was really long

2307
02:13:15.520 --> 02:13:18.120
because he died by age in 1986,

2308
02:13:19.480 --> 02:13:20.560
somewhere in Germany.

2309
02:13:24.920 --> 02:13:26.680
After Heydrich's death,

2310
02:13:26.760 --> 02:13:28.720
Dr. Herta Oberheuser tried

2311
02:13:28.800 --> 02:13:31.760
to recreate sepsis in healthy people,

2312
02:13:31.840 --> 02:13:34.440
cutting them open without anesthetic,

2313
02:13:34.520 --> 02:13:37.760
then rubbing wood dirt or
saw dust into the wounds.


2314
02:13:41.080 --> 02:13:44.160
Following the 10-month
Nuremberg Doctors' Trial,


2315
02:13:44.240 --> 02:13:47.960
Oberheuser was sentenced
to 20 years imprisonment.


2316
02:13:48.040 --> 02:13:53.000
She served just five years for
killing countless children.


2317
02:13:54.160 --> 02:13:56.400
On release, she started practicing

2318
02:13:56.480 --> 02:13:58.680
as a family doctor in Germany,

2319
02:13:58.760 --> 02:14:01.040
and only after considerable pressure

2320
02:14:01.120 --> 02:14:03.240
was her license revoked.

2321
02:14:03.320 --> 02:14:06.280
She died in 1978, aged 66.

2322
02:14:26.480 --> 02:14:29.160
- Oradour-sur-Glane
was one of two villages


2323
02:14:29.240 --> 02:14:32.280
where SS Gruppenführer Heinz Lammerding

2324
02:14:32.360 --> 02:14:34.920
ordered the murders of all the inhabitants

2325
02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:37.280
and razed the village to the ground.

2326
02:14:49.880 --> 02:14:52.840
Heinz Barth was the only
SS officer to stand trial


2327
02:14:52.920 --> 02:14:54.840
for the massacre that took place here.

2328
02:14:55.720 --> 02:14:59.000
In 1983, he was imprisoned in East Germany

2329
02:14:59.080 --> 02:15:02.280
for his part in murdering
hundreds of French citizens.


2330
02:15:02.360 --> 02:15:05.040
He was also at the Ležáky massacre,

2331
02:15:05.120 --> 02:15:07.240
yet just 15 years later,

2332
02:15:07.320 --> 02:15:10.120
he was released with a full war pension.

2333
02:15:10.200 --> 02:15:13.480
In 2007, he died, aged 86.

2334
02:15:21.720 --> 02:15:26.760
This is the picturesque town
of Bad Tölz where in 1971,


2335
02:15:26.840 --> 02:15:30.840
at the age of 65, Heinz
Lammerding died a wealthy man.


2336
02:15:32.520 --> 02:15:36.680
In 1953, a French court
had found him guilty


2337
02:15:36.760 --> 02:15:41.760
in absentia of the murder
of 750 French citizens.


2338
02:15:42.720 --> 02:15:46.880
The West German government did
absolutely nothing about it.


2339
02:15:47.840 --> 02:15:52.840
His funeral was said to be a
jolly affair of SS comrades.


2340
02:15:59.080 --> 02:16:03.240
- The Western ally put a
provision in the treaty


2341
02:16:03.320 --> 02:16:07.440
with the new Federal Republic
of Germany in the '50s


2342
02:16:07.520 --> 02:16:12.320
that West Germany was not
allowed to reopen cases


2343
02:16:12.400 --> 02:16:17.040
that had already been
finalized by the Allied.


2344
02:16:17.120 --> 02:16:20.760
So the idea was, "Don't touch our cases,"

2345
02:16:20.840 --> 02:16:24.480
because they feared a less-severe sentence

2346
02:16:24.560 --> 02:16:27.720
when Germany would reopen these cases.

2347
02:16:27.800 --> 02:16:31.400
But then when it comes to
the verdicts in absentia


2348
02:16:31.480 --> 02:16:33.800
in France and in Italy,

2349
02:16:33.880 --> 02:16:37.680
that led to the almost paradox situation

2350
02:16:37.760 --> 02:16:41.840
that then Germany said, "Yeah,
we can't reopen the case.


2351
02:16:41.920 --> 02:16:45.800
"We are not allowed to
because you, France,


2352
02:16:45.880 --> 02:16:48.920
"have already dealt with the case."

2353
02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:53.080
So the reasoning just backfired.

2354
02:16:53.160 --> 02:16:57.920
Instead of keeping the verdict,

2355
02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:00.600
you got nothing from the point of view

2356
02:17:00.680 --> 02:17:02.840
of the French government.

2357
02:17:02.920 --> 02:17:04.680
And Germany then refused

2358
02:17:04.760 --> 02:17:08.440
to just take the verdict in absentia

2359
02:17:08.520 --> 02:17:11.720
and put him into jail because we think

2360
02:17:11.800 --> 02:17:14.880
that you need a trial with the defendant,

2361
02:17:14.960 --> 02:17:17.520
the accused present before the court.

2362
02:17:18.800 --> 02:17:21.080
So he got away with murder.

2363
02:17:21.160 --> 02:17:22.880
- The result of that situation,

2364
02:17:22.960 --> 02:17:26.360
especially with a verdicts
in absentia in France,


2365
02:17:26.440 --> 02:17:31.080
was that for a long time,
there was no verdict at all.


2366
02:17:31.160 --> 02:17:33.200
The French was just in paper

2367
02:17:33.280 --> 02:17:36.160
and in Germany, there was no procedure.

2368
02:17:36.240 --> 02:17:40.280
And the situation only
changed in the mid of the '70s


2369
02:17:40.360 --> 02:17:42.480
when a special agreement was made

2370
02:17:42.560 --> 02:17:44.480
between France and Germany

2371
02:17:44.560 --> 02:17:48.080
that allowed Germany to reopen the cases.

2372
02:17:50.840 --> 02:17:54.000
Alois Brunner,
Eichmann's assistant,


2373
02:17:54.080 --> 02:17:57.360
was responsible for
sending 100,000 to ghettos


2374
02:17:57.440 --> 02:17:59.120
and concentration camps.

2375
02:18:00.120 --> 02:18:03.240
Condemned to death in absentia in France,

2376
02:18:03.320 --> 02:18:06.320
he fled West Germany in 1954

2377
02:18:06.400 --> 02:18:08.640
to a eventual residence in Syria.

2378
02:18:09.680 --> 02:18:13.000
Unrepentant, he received a generous salary

2379
02:18:13.080 --> 02:18:15.200
from the ruling Barth party

2380
02:18:15.280 --> 02:18:18.320
for his professional advice on torture.

2381
02:18:19.440 --> 02:18:24.440
He died in either 2001,
aged 89 or 2010, aged 98.


2382
02:18:25.280 --> 02:18:28.600
Either way, he lived a longer
life than all his victims.


2383
02:18:51.160 --> 02:18:55.160
- This is Salztorgasse, 
Salt Gate Street,

2384
02:18:55.240 --> 02:18:58.960
and this was the back
entrance of the huge building


2385
02:18:59.040 --> 02:19:01.560
of the former Gestapo headquarters.

2386
02:19:01.640 --> 02:19:04.680
It was installed here because this was

2387
02:19:04.760 --> 02:19:07.400
a big hotel, a Jewish hotel.

2388
02:19:07.480 --> 02:19:11.160
And in 1938, this was
seized by the Gestapo


2389
02:19:11.240 --> 02:19:13.800
and made the headquarters.

2390
02:19:13.880 --> 02:19:15.800
It had been completely destroyed

2391
02:19:15.880 --> 02:19:18.280
during the Second World War.

2392
02:19:18.360 --> 02:19:23.040
In the 1950s, it had been
rebuilt as a condominium.


2393
02:19:23.120 --> 02:19:25.400
And this was the back
entrance where the victims,


2394
02:19:25.480 --> 02:19:30.360
where the prisoners were
brought to be questioned there.


2395
02:19:30.680 --> 02:19:34.720
And people who bought apartments here,

2396
02:19:34.800 --> 02:19:39.800
they contributed to establish
that memorial site here.


2397
02:19:40.760 --> 02:19:45.760
And when Simon Wiesenthal
looked for a new office,


2398
02:19:46.360 --> 02:19:47.560
he said, "Why not here

2399
02:19:47.640 --> 02:19:49.600
"in the former building of Gestapo?"

2400
02:19:49.680 --> 02:19:51.840
And this was exactly here.

2401
02:19:51.920 --> 02:19:55.080
So you have still the white plaque here.

2402
02:19:55.160 --> 02:20:00.160
Here was written, "Documentation
center of the Association


2403
02:20:01.440 --> 02:20:05.680
"of Jewish-persecuted
people of Nazi time."


2404
02:20:05.760 --> 02:20:07.920
So he specifically chose it

2405
02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:09.720
because it was a Gestapo headquarters.

2406
02:20:09.800 --> 02:20:11.720
- I am sure of it because,

2407
02:20:11.800 --> 02:20:16.320
yeah, it has a symbolic
worth to do that work


2408
02:20:17.200 --> 02:20:19.480
on that place where the Gestapo

2409
02:20:19.560 --> 02:20:22.520
did its ugly work before, yeah.

2410
02:20:28.440 --> 02:20:31.440
Gustav Wagner,
nicknamed "The Beast,"


2411
02:20:31.520 --> 02:20:33.120
was the first deputy commander

2412
02:20:33.200 --> 02:20:36.720
of Sobibor extermination camp in Poland.

2413
02:20:36.800 --> 02:20:39.080
He ran the selection process

2414
02:20:39.160 --> 02:20:41.760
that led to slave labor or death,

2415
02:20:41.840 --> 02:20:45.640
where 200 to 250,000 Jews were murdered.

2416
02:20:46.520 --> 02:20:50.000
Sentenced to death in
absentia, he escaped to Brazil.


2417
02:20:50.920 --> 02:20:52.280
After his exposure,

2418
02:20:52.360 --> 02:20:55.920
several extradition
requests were rejected.


2419
02:20:56.000 --> 02:20:58.320
In 1980, aged 69,

2420
02:20:58.400 --> 02:21:01.760
he was found dead with
a knife in his chest.


2421
02:21:01.840 --> 02:21:05.800
His attorney said that
he had committed suicide.


2422
02:21:24.280 --> 02:21:25.920
- The DOW, in German,

2423
02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:29.720
Dokumentationsarchiv des
österreichischen Widerstandes,


2424
02:21:29.800 --> 02:21:33.440
Documentation Center
of Austrian Resistance,


2425
02:21:33.520 --> 02:21:36.000
is an institution which was founded

2426
02:21:36.080 --> 02:21:38.600
to document resistance in Austria

2427
02:21:38.680 --> 02:21:41.400
at the time when everybody
spoke only of the soldiers


2428
02:21:41.480 --> 02:21:44.880
of the Second World War in the 1960s.

2429
02:21:44.960 --> 02:21:47.840
But meanwhile, it has become one

2430
02:21:47.920 --> 02:21:50.880
of the leading institution
for the whole period,


2431
02:21:50.960 --> 02:21:53.520
especially for Holocaust
research in Austria.


2432
02:21:53.600 --> 02:21:58.000
And our big, biggest, most
important project started


2433
02:21:58.080 --> 02:22:01.720
in the 1990s to compile a database

2434
02:22:01.800 --> 02:22:04.280
of all Austrian Holocaust victims.

2435
02:22:05.280 --> 02:22:08.240
Simon Wiesenthal was, in my opinion,

2436
02:22:08.320 --> 02:22:12.080
the most important person with respect

2437
02:22:12.160 --> 02:22:15.000
to the prosecution

2438
02:22:15.080 --> 02:22:18.400
of former Nazi criminals in Austria,

2439
02:22:18.480 --> 02:22:22.880
because he pushed the Austrian
judiciary to do its work.


2440
02:22:23.920 --> 02:22:26.320
He was a Polish Jew of Eastern Poland,

2441
02:22:26.400 --> 02:22:30.840
and he was a survivor of
many concentration camps.


2442
02:22:30.920 --> 02:22:36.040
But his career in the Nazi
concentration camps ended


2443
02:22:36.760 --> 02:22:40.160
on Austrian soil, it was in Mauthausen.

2444
02:22:40.240 --> 02:22:42.960
And already during the last weeks

2445
02:22:43.040 --> 02:22:46.440
of the existence of
the concentration camp,


2446
02:22:47.680 --> 02:22:52.680
he started to collect evidence
against the perpetrators.


2447
02:22:53.120 --> 02:22:56.400
And when the Americans liberated us,

2448
02:22:56.480 --> 02:23:00.120
the concentration camp,
he followed them to Linz,


2449
02:23:00.200 --> 02:23:02.280
Linz is very near to Mauthausen,

2450
02:23:02.360 --> 02:23:07.120
and established his own bureau
of collecting of evidence


2451
02:23:07.200 --> 02:23:11.000
to help the American judicial authorities

2452
02:23:11.080 --> 02:23:13.680
institute proceedings
against those criminals,


2453
02:23:13.760 --> 02:23:16.280
and to prepare the court cases,

2454
02:23:16.360 --> 02:23:17.920
both in Nuremberg and in Dachau.

2455
02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:20.280
In the former Dachau,
the concentration camp,


2456
02:23:20.360 --> 02:23:24.120
American law officers prepared

2457
02:23:24.200 --> 02:23:27.480
some trials against the
perpetrators of Mauthausen.


2458
02:23:27.560 --> 02:23:30.120
And there, Simon Wiesenthal was one

2459
02:23:30.200 --> 02:23:33.480
of the most important
persons to collect evidence.


2460
02:23:33.560 --> 02:23:35.160
And immediately after the war,

2461
02:23:35.240 --> 02:23:37.880
you had more trials in Austria than,

2462
02:23:37.960 --> 02:23:39.480
for instance, in Germany.

2463
02:23:40.520 --> 02:23:42.160
And in that time,

2464
02:23:42.240 --> 02:23:46.080
some six or 7,000 out of them were

2465
02:23:46.160 --> 02:23:49.120
of cases of murder,

2466
02:23:49.200 --> 02:23:53.760
assault and battery, and...

2467
02:23:53.840 --> 02:23:58.040
Robbery, Aryanization,
and theft and all that.


2468
02:23:58.120 --> 02:24:00.720
And we had 43 death sentences,

2469
02:24:00.800 --> 02:24:04.480
29 sentences with life imprisonment,

2470
02:24:04.560 --> 02:24:07.680
and around 300 or so sentences

2471
02:24:07.760 --> 02:24:11.320
in the upper range
between 10 and 20 years.


2472
02:24:11.400 --> 02:24:15.800
But immediately after the last Ally troops

2473
02:24:15.880 --> 02:24:18.120
had left Austria in 1955,

2474
02:24:18.200 --> 02:24:20.880
started this period

2475
02:24:20.960 --> 02:24:24.440
where we had only a very few

2476
02:24:25.400 --> 02:24:27.000
amount of trials.

2477
02:24:27.080 --> 02:24:32.080
And Simon Wiesenthal played
a very, very important role


2478
02:24:32.680 --> 02:24:36.000
to bring forward some
of the most important


2479
02:24:36.080 --> 02:24:38.720
of those few Austrian trials.

2480
02:24:38.800 --> 02:24:42.600
Not only because he
pushed forward some cases


2481
02:24:42.680 --> 02:24:46.840
and brought it to public
attention, and also...


2482
02:24:48.360 --> 02:24:51.520
Forced Austrian judiciary to do something.

2483
02:24:51.600 --> 02:24:53.880
But when, as soon as

2484
02:24:54.920 --> 02:24:58.200
the court case started before the court,

2485
02:24:58.280 --> 02:25:01.560
you had the main trial and there,

2486
02:25:02.880 --> 02:25:05.400
witnesses were summoned.

2487
02:25:05.480 --> 02:25:08.200
And you had to prepare the witnesses.

2488
02:25:08.280 --> 02:25:10.200
You had, first, you had to find them,

2489
02:25:10.280 --> 02:25:12.240
there, he played a very important role.

2490
02:25:12.320 --> 02:25:14.360
And then you had to prepare them.

2491
02:25:15.480 --> 02:25:17.520
Austrian authorities were not interested

2492
02:25:17.600 --> 02:25:21.000
in what those people

2493
02:25:21.080 --> 02:25:24.960
had lived through in the Nazi time.

2494
02:25:25.040 --> 02:25:26.840
And how they could protect them

2495
02:25:26.920 --> 02:25:28.840
and how they could help
them to deal with that?


2496
02:25:28.920 --> 02:25:33.760
It's not that easy
to go inside a building

2497
02:25:34.760 --> 02:25:37.560
where you have people who have uniforms

2498
02:25:37.640 --> 02:25:41.040
who are not that different
from the old Nazi uniforms,


2499
02:25:41.120 --> 02:25:44.640
and then to be a witness there

2500
02:25:44.720 --> 02:25:47.400
and to say what happened and to remember.

2501
02:25:47.480 --> 02:25:49.320
And Wiesenthal was the only person

2502
02:25:49.400 --> 02:25:50.880
who helped those people.

2503
02:25:50.960 --> 02:25:55.000
But half of those trials
ended with a guilty verdict.


2504
02:25:55.080 --> 02:25:58.800
And most of those guilty
verdicts were very, very lenient.


2505
02:25:58.880 --> 02:26:03.360
And this contributed to the meaning

2506
02:26:03.440 --> 02:26:05.800
that Austria is really
a kind of safe haven.


2507
02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:11.760
Franz Murer
was an Austrian SS officer


2508
02:26:11.840 --> 02:26:16.840
who, from 1941 to '43,
served in Vilnius, Lithuania,


2509
02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:21.240
which was often referred to as
the "Jerusalem of the North."


2510
02:26:21.320 --> 02:26:24.280
This capital city had a Jewish population

2511
02:26:24.360 --> 02:26:27.520
of around 80,000 before the war,

2512
02:26:27.600 --> 02:26:30.760
but just 250 afterwards.

2513
02:26:32.280 --> 02:26:37.280
Murer was found guilty in 1948
of murdering Soviet citizens


2514
02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:40.000
and sentenced first to death,

2515
02:26:40.080 --> 02:26:44.880
but then commuted to 25
years hard labor in the USSR.


2516
02:26:46.520 --> 02:26:49.320
He was released in 1955

2517
02:26:49.400 --> 02:26:52.040
as part of the Austrian State Treaty,

2518
02:26:52.120 --> 02:26:53.560
and returned to Vienna.

2519
02:26:54.720 --> 02:26:57.280
Because of the work of Simon Wiesenthal,

2520
02:26:57.360 --> 02:27:01.680
he was arrested and prosecuted
again in 1963 in Austria.


2521
02:27:02.680 --> 02:27:06.600
The one-week trial ended
with Murer's acquittal.


2522
02:27:06.680 --> 02:27:10.480
He died in 1994, aged 81.

2523
02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:14.880
- The Austrian courts
were quite extraordinary.


2524
02:27:14.960 --> 02:27:19.200
After 1955, they brought
virtually no one to trial.


2525
02:27:19.280 --> 02:27:22.560
They brought a couple of
dozen cases in Austria.


2526
02:27:22.640 --> 02:27:24.320
But it was getting embarrassing

2527
02:27:24.400 --> 02:27:27.240
because juries would
acquit known murderers,


2528
02:27:27.320 --> 02:27:30.040
like Franz Murer, the
"Butcher of Vilnius."


2529
02:27:30.120 --> 02:27:32.960
And because it was getting embarrassing

2530
02:27:33.040 --> 02:27:34.600
that there were these acquittals

2531
02:27:34.680 --> 02:27:36.600
and that perpetrators were greeted

2532
02:27:36.680 --> 02:27:38.360
with flowers and applause,

2533
02:27:38.440 --> 02:27:41.120
and their mates were just cheering them

2534
02:27:41.200 --> 02:27:42.720
when they were acquitted,

2535
02:27:42.800 --> 02:27:45.920
by the mid 1970s, it
seemed simpler in Austria


2536
02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:48.680
not to bring anyone to trial at all.

2537
02:27:52.040 --> 02:27:53.520
Certainly in my country,

2538
02:27:53.600 --> 02:27:56.760
there's the feeling that for a long time,

2539
02:27:56.840 --> 02:27:59.280
Austria had a narrative of,

2540
02:27:59.360 --> 02:28:01.720
"We were victims of the Nazis too.

2541
02:28:02.880 --> 02:28:05.160
"The Germans invaded Austria."

2542
02:28:05.240 --> 02:28:07.320
- Yeah, that's absolutely true.

2543
02:28:07.400 --> 02:28:09.320
That's absolutely true.

2544
02:28:09.400 --> 02:28:11.520
It was, the Austrians were invited

2545
02:28:11.600 --> 02:28:13.760
to have that narrative by the Allies.

2546
02:28:13.840 --> 02:28:15.600
The Allies had their conference,

2547
02:28:15.680 --> 02:28:17.960
the three Allies, in Moscow

2548
02:28:19.240 --> 02:28:22.840
in late 1943, and there,
they made some declarations


2549
02:28:22.920 --> 02:28:26.960
about Nazi atrocities, about
how to deal with Italy,


2550
02:28:27.040 --> 02:28:28.560
and how to deal with Austria.

2551
02:28:28.640 --> 02:28:30.600
And in that declaration of Austria,

2552
02:28:30.680 --> 02:28:33.160
they said, "Austria as a state,

2553
02:28:33.240 --> 02:28:36.360
"was the first victim of

2554
02:28:36.440 --> 02:28:40.600
"Hitler's aggression policy,"
which is absolutely true.


2555
02:28:40.680 --> 02:28:45.840
But it says nothing about
the role of the Austrians


2556
02:28:45.920 --> 02:28:49.200
in the annexation process in 1938.

2557
02:28:49.280 --> 02:28:52.520
But you had in that
declaration of Austria,


2558
02:28:52.600 --> 02:28:54.920
you had one very important sentence.

2559
02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:59.640
"Austria has a responsibility though

2560
02:28:59.720 --> 02:29:04.720
"for her participation in
Hitler's war of aggression."


2561
02:29:04.920 --> 02:29:09.640
But this declaration was
repeated again and again,


2562
02:29:09.720 --> 02:29:12.120
but only the first part
of the declaration,


2563
02:29:12.200 --> 02:29:15.760
and Austria declared herself as a victim.

2564
02:29:15.840 --> 02:29:17.000
This was very practical.

2565
02:29:17.080 --> 02:29:18.720
They could hide behind the Germans.

2566
02:29:18.800 --> 02:29:20.520
The Germans were the perpetrates,

2567
02:29:20.600 --> 02:29:22.400
and the Austrians were the victims.

2568
02:29:22.480 --> 02:29:27.120
And the government held
this official position,


2569
02:29:27.200 --> 02:29:29.320
"We are victims."

2570
02:29:29.400 --> 02:29:33.400
But in the beginning of 1937,

2571
02:29:33.480 --> 02:29:34.720
the claimed that the Nazi party

2572
02:29:34.800 --> 02:29:38.800
in Austria had around 70,000 members.

2573
02:29:39.960 --> 02:29:42.240
Austria was a country of
six million inhabitants


2574
02:29:42.320 --> 02:29:43.080
at that time.

2575
02:29:43.160 --> 02:29:48.160
But after the annexation of March, 1938,

2576
02:29:49.080 --> 02:29:52.600
tens of thousands wanted
to join the Nazi party.


2577
02:29:52.680 --> 02:29:57.720
And in Austria, you had more
than half a million members


2578
02:29:57.800 --> 02:30:00.200
of the Nazi party after the annexation.

2579
02:30:00.280 --> 02:30:02.560
And in addition to all that,

2580
02:30:02.640 --> 02:30:05.280
you had the pogrom on
the streets of Vienna.


2581
02:30:05.360 --> 02:30:07.360
And this was not the Germans,

2582
02:30:07.440 --> 02:30:09.920
it was the Viennese anti
-Semites.

2583
02:30:10.760 --> 02:30:13.800
They felt, "Now it's possible.

2584
02:30:13.880 --> 02:30:17.760
"There will be impunity for
that, we could do that."


2585
02:30:17.840 --> 02:30:20.600
They could beat and call their names

2586
02:30:20.680 --> 02:30:24.040
and humiliate our Jewish neighbors.

2587
02:30:24.120 --> 02:30:26.720
It started before the first

2588
02:30:26.800 --> 02:30:28.920
German soldier arrived in Vienna.

2589
02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:33.920
And it was not Hitler, it
was the Viennese themselves,


2590
02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:37.320
what they were doing against
their Jewish neighbors.


2591
02:30:37.400 --> 02:30:42.400
But yeah, it lasted really
until the middle of the 1980s


2592
02:30:43.600 --> 02:30:47.040
that the Austrian public
realized what had happened.


2593
02:30:47.120 --> 02:30:50.960
And this had to do with the

2594
02:30:51.920 --> 02:30:54.480
candidate of Kurt Waldheim

2595
02:30:54.560 --> 02:30:57.840
who was Secretary General
of the United Nations.


2596
02:30:57.920 --> 02:31:00.440
And this really was the beginning

2597
02:31:00.520 --> 02:31:02.760
of a completely new approach

2598
02:31:02.840 --> 02:31:05.120
towards the Nazi time in Austria.

2599
02:31:07.040 --> 02:31:10.800
- For pretty much the
entire decade of the 1970s,


2600
02:31:10.880 --> 02:31:13.760
Kurt Waldheim was the Secretary General

2601
02:31:13.840 --> 02:31:14.920
of the United Nations,

2602
02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:18.720
the Chief Humanitarian
Officer for the world.


2603
02:31:18.800 --> 02:31:20.400
And as he's sitting there

2604
02:31:20.480 --> 02:31:23.520
in his United Nations
building in New York,


2605
02:31:23.600 --> 02:31:25.080
in the very same building,

2606
02:31:25.160 --> 02:31:28.400
stored somewhere in the
basement is a folder,


2607
02:31:28.480 --> 02:31:32.120
also compiled by his organization
some 40 years earlier,


2608
02:31:32.200 --> 02:31:36.160
which has his name and
accuses him of murder.


2609
02:31:36.240 --> 02:31:40.760
Waldheim stepped down from
his position in the early '80s


2610
02:31:40.840 --> 02:31:43.440
when there was a furor

2611
02:31:43.520 --> 02:31:46.440
when all these allegations
were finally revealed.


2612
02:31:46.520 --> 02:31:51.480
He was nevertheless selected
as president of Austria,


2613
02:31:51.560 --> 02:31:55.560
his homeland, and the
United States decided


2614
02:31:55.640 --> 02:31:58.560
to conduct its own very
extensive investigation


2615
02:31:58.640 --> 02:32:00.040
into the charges.

2616
02:32:00.120 --> 02:32:01.760
And they discovered that there was a case

2617
02:32:01.800 --> 02:32:04.360
to answer on a number of camps,

2618
02:32:04.440 --> 02:32:07.200
including the fact that Waldheim

2619
02:32:07.280 --> 02:32:11.000
had surrendered many individuals to the SS

2620
02:32:11.080 --> 02:32:12.640
to become slave laborers,

2621
02:32:12.720 --> 02:32:15.360
and had also been materially involved

2622
02:32:15.440 --> 02:32:20.120
in the deportations of
hundreds of civilians,


2623
02:32:20.200 --> 02:32:23.240
especially Jews, from Greece and Bosnia,

2624
02:32:23.320 --> 02:32:26.600
who ended up in concentration
and death camps.


2625
02:32:26.680 --> 02:32:30.640
And as a result of this,
the US decided to bar him


2626
02:32:30.720 --> 02:32:33.240
from entry onto its territories,

2627
02:32:33.320 --> 02:32:35.280
which means that Kurt Waldheim

2628
02:32:35.360 --> 02:32:39.480
became the very first
serving head of state


2629
02:32:39.560 --> 02:32:43.040
to be put by the US on their
immigration watch list.


2630
02:33:03.880 --> 02:33:05.880
This is where Hitler was born.

2631
02:33:18.200 --> 02:33:19.720
So we know there were lots of charges

2632
02:33:19.800 --> 02:33:21.240
brought against lots of people.

2633
02:33:21.320 --> 02:33:24.360
I mean, presumably, somebody
brought charges against Hitler.


2634
02:33:24.440 --> 02:33:27.120
- Well, there was
a quite a taboo against

2635
02:33:27.200 --> 02:33:28.720
prosecuting head of state.

2636
02:33:29.960 --> 02:33:33.200
But what should be very
interesting to modern lawyers is


2637
02:33:33.280 --> 02:33:38.320
that in fact, yes, at the time
of the Battle of the Bulge,


2638
02:33:38.400 --> 02:33:41.720
December, 1944, the Czech,

2639
02:33:41.800 --> 02:33:45.400
the Slovak government
brought very lengthy dossiers


2640
02:33:45.480 --> 02:33:47.920
in two sets of charges against Hitler.

2641
02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:50.760
And the 16 countries,
including the British,


2642
02:33:50.840 --> 02:33:54.080
and the Americans approved these charges.

2643
02:33:54.160 --> 02:33:56.720
And it isn't known that
Hitler, when he died,


2644
02:33:56.800 --> 02:33:58.920
was in fact an indicted war criminal

2645
02:33:59.000 --> 02:34:02.360
by the Czechoslovaks, with
the support of the Allies.


2646
02:34:09.080 --> 02:34:12.880
- This is where Hitler died,
and like Göring, Goebbels,


2647
02:34:12.960 --> 02:34:16.320
Himmler, Bormann, and
many other leading Nazis,


2648
02:34:16.400 --> 02:34:18.840
he was ultimately a coward

2649
02:34:18.920 --> 02:34:22.280
who took his own life
rather than face justice.


2650
02:34:38.960 --> 02:34:41.240
- This is the Topography of Terror.

2651
02:34:41.320 --> 02:34:46.200
It was the former site of the
Reichssicherheitshauptamt,


2652
02:34:46.280 --> 02:34:49.360
the Main Security Office of the Reich,

2653
02:34:49.440 --> 02:34:51.240
which was where Heinrich Himmler,

2654
02:34:51.320 --> 02:34:54.600
Reinhard Heydrich, and
others had the center


2655
02:34:54.680 --> 02:34:57.440
of physical oppression, the SS,

2656
02:34:57.520 --> 02:35:01.000
the SD, which was the
security service of the SS,


2657
02:35:01.080 --> 02:35:03.880
the Gestapo, the police forces,

2658
02:35:03.960 --> 02:35:05.720
all the people who were involved

2659
02:35:05.800 --> 02:35:08.920
in the reign of terror
through physical force.


2660
02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:13.320
It was in the late 1980s that
they started to dig here.


2661
02:35:13.400 --> 02:35:16.040
It had been used, it's hard
up against the former wall


2662
02:35:16.120 --> 02:35:17.800
between East and West Berlin.

2663
02:35:17.880 --> 02:35:20.040
And it was just no man's
land, really, being used


2664
02:35:20.120 --> 02:35:24.360
as a driving practice area
or off-street driving.


2665
02:35:24.440 --> 02:35:26.616
And then they decided they
were gonna dig the foundations


2666
02:35:26.640 --> 02:35:29.120
for building a block and
discovered here the walls


2667
02:35:29.200 --> 02:35:31.800
of the former Gestapo cellars,

2668
02:35:31.880 --> 02:35:35.040
places where people had been
held, had been tortured.


2669
02:35:36.600 --> 02:35:39.480
This kind of memorialization
looking at perpetrators


2670
02:35:39.560 --> 02:35:43.560
is really from only from
the late 1980s onwards.


2671
02:35:43.640 --> 02:35:45.960
And there is a resistance to facing up

2672
02:35:46.040 --> 02:35:47.960
to who'd done it, basically.

2673
02:35:56.920 --> 02:35:59.520
So this is the Tiergarten, Großer,

2674
02:35:59.600 --> 02:36:02.400
for the site which gave its name

2675
02:36:02.480 --> 02:36:05.160
to the so-called T4 Euthanasia Program

2676
02:36:05.240 --> 02:36:07.440
because it was the central headquarters

2677
02:36:07.520 --> 02:36:10.320
which coordinated a program
of killing the mentally


2678
02:36:10.400 --> 02:36:13.320
and physically disabled across the Reich,

2679
02:36:13.400 --> 02:36:15.680
initially from 1939 to '41

2680
02:36:15.760 --> 02:36:18.840
in six main sanatoria institutes

2681
02:36:18.920 --> 02:36:22.760
where they installed gas chambers
specifically to kill them.


2682
02:36:22.840 --> 02:36:25.680
Then unofficially, for the rest
of the war across the Reich,


2683
02:36:25.760 --> 02:36:27.760
in care homes and hospitals,

2684
02:36:27.840 --> 02:36:30.960
killing patients by use of overdoses

2685
02:36:31.040 --> 02:36:35.200
of poisonous powders or simply starvation.

2686
02:36:35.280 --> 02:36:38.160
One guy, Fran Müller, in a Munich clinic,

2687
02:36:38.240 --> 02:36:40.200
was so proud of his hunger wards

2688
02:36:40.280 --> 02:36:41.600
that he actually took a bunch

2689
02:36:41.680 --> 02:36:43.200
of students around and showed them.

2690
02:36:43.280 --> 02:36:45.240
He picked up a
baby by the skin hanging

2691
02:36:45.320 --> 02:36:47.080
off the back of
its neck and said, "Look,

2692
02:36:47.160 --> 02:36:51.120
"I give this one another two
or three days before it dies."


2693
02:36:51.200 --> 02:36:55.400
So in one case, a guy
called Alfred Loy argued


2694
02:36:55.480 --> 02:36:57.280
that if he had not stayed in post

2695
02:36:57.360 --> 02:37:00.920
and killed only 80 to 100 children,

2696
02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:06.000
then a worse Nazi, a more
fanatic Nazi would've killed 180.


2697
02:37:06.160 --> 02:37:08.760
So he got away with murder too.

2698
02:37:08.840 --> 02:37:10.080
In another case,

2699
02:37:10.160 --> 02:37:14.640
a guy called Horst Schumann
managed to fake symptoms


2700
02:37:14.720 --> 02:37:17.640
so that he appeared
too ill to stand trial.


2701
02:37:17.720 --> 02:37:20.000
He swallowed blood and
then made himself vomit


2702
02:37:20.080 --> 02:37:21.680
on the way to the courtroom,

2703
02:37:21.760 --> 02:37:24.480
and thus the blood-fleck
vomit made it look


2704
02:37:24.560 --> 02:37:27.840
like he was genuinely
too ill to stand trial.


2705
02:37:27.920 --> 02:37:31.080
In other cases, people used legal defenses

2706
02:37:31.160 --> 02:37:33.120
like, "Never knew I was
doing anything wrong,"


2707
02:37:33.200 --> 02:37:34.400
"didn't know it was criminal,"

2708
02:37:34.440 --> 02:37:37.600
even though it was explicitly
a criminal act at the time.


2709
02:37:43.160 --> 02:37:46.800
This is the memorial to the
homosexual victims of Nazis


2710
02:37:46.880 --> 02:37:49.960
And the number of victims
was not enormous compared


2711
02:37:50.040 --> 02:37:52.680
to the six million murdered Jews.

2712
02:37:52.760 --> 02:37:56.720
It was maybe 10
to 15,000 gay men died

2713
02:37:56.800 --> 02:38:00.760
as a result of imprisonment,
maltreatment by the Nazis.


2714
02:38:00.840 --> 02:38:03.360
But the problem after the war was

2715
02:38:03.440 --> 02:38:05.880
that homosexuality was still the subject

2716
02:38:05.960 --> 02:38:07.640
of criminal proceedings,

2717
02:38:07.720 --> 02:38:09.520
for a quarter of
a century after the war

2718
02:38:09.600 --> 02:38:12.520
in East Germany, in West
Germany, in Austria.


2719
02:38:12.600 --> 02:38:14.360
And you get a man like Heinz Hager,

2720
02:38:14.440 --> 02:38:17.520
that's a pseudonym for
an Austrian who was gay,


2721
02:38:17.600 --> 02:38:20.800
who was arrested when his
love affair was found,


2722
02:38:20.880 --> 02:38:23.360
he was sent to Flossenbürg,
the concentration camp.


2723
02:38:23.440 --> 02:38:26.480
He was liberated at the end
of the war, he went home.


2724
02:38:26.560 --> 02:38:30.480
The very same bureaucrat
sitting in the same office


2725
02:38:30.560 --> 02:38:33.400
as who'd sent him to
Flossenbürg under Nazism,


2726
02:38:33.480 --> 02:38:36.080
is still sitting there
and says, "Sorry, mate,


2727
02:38:36.160 --> 02:38:38.760
"you've still got two years
to run on your sentence.


2728
02:38:38.840 --> 02:38:41.000
"You have to spend
two years in prison now

2729
02:38:41.080 --> 02:38:42.800
"to finish your sentence."

2730
02:38:49.800 --> 02:38:53.160
This is the memorial to the
Roma and Sinti, the Gypsies


2731
02:38:53.240 --> 02:38:57.280
and it was only opened in

2732
02:38:57.360 --> 02:39:00.240
And this particular
group is only recognized


2733
02:39:00.320 --> 02:39:02.480
as a group of victims
of national socialism,


2734
02:39:02.560 --> 02:39:05.840
very, very belatedly
after incredible pressure


2735
02:39:05.920 --> 02:39:09.160
from the Sinti community
from the 1980s onwards.


2736
02:39:14.360 --> 02:39:16.480
- These brass squares we see

2737
02:39:16.560 --> 02:39:18.760
kind of everywhere,
really, what do they mean?


2738
02:39:18.840 --> 02:39:22.320
- They're called Stolpersteine,
"stumbling stones,"


2739
02:39:22.400 --> 02:39:24.960
and they have the
names and the life dates

2740
02:39:25.040 --> 02:39:27.960
of individuals generally
set outside the last place


2741
02:39:28.040 --> 02:39:30.840
where they voluntarily lived
before they were arrested,


2742
02:39:30.920 --> 02:39:33.520
deported, taken to their deaths.

2743
02:39:33.600 --> 02:39:36.600
And so they're a kind of
individual form of remembrance,


2744
02:39:36.680 --> 02:39:39.400
giving a name back to
a person in a place

2745
02:39:39.480 --> 02:39:40.760
where they had lived.

2746
02:39:40.840 --> 02:39:43.760
And they raise the question,
what were the people thinking


2747
02:39:43.840 --> 02:39:45.840
who looked out of the windows opposite,

2748
02:39:45.920 --> 02:39:48.000
who watched them being thrown into trucks

2749
02:39:48.080 --> 02:39:50.240
and taken away for deportation?

2750
02:39:50.320 --> 02:39:53.760
So I find them a very effective
form of memorialization.


2751
02:40:02.280 --> 02:40:05.040
This is the memorial to the
murdered Jews of Europe,


2752
02:40:05.120 --> 02:40:08.320
a massive memorial on what
had been no man's land


2753
02:40:08.400 --> 02:40:12.360
between East and West Berlin
at the time of division.


2754
02:40:12.440 --> 02:40:15.680
After unification, it's right in the heart

2755
02:40:15.760 --> 02:40:18.280
of Germany's new capital city, Berlin.

2756
02:40:18.360 --> 02:40:20.560
It's right up close to
the Brandenburg Gate,


2757
02:40:20.640 --> 02:40:23.400
the Reichstag, but it's yet again,

2758
02:40:23.480 --> 02:40:26.800
Germany getting this great reputation

2759
02:40:26.880 --> 02:40:28.200
for facing up to the past,

2760
02:40:28.280 --> 02:40:33.280
a fantastically strong reputation
by belated remembrance.


2761
02:40:34.040 --> 02:40:38.440
And yet at the time they could
have brought Nazis to court,


2762
02:40:38.520 --> 02:40:41.840
could have brought the perpetrators
to account, they didn't.


2763
02:40:41.920 --> 02:40:44.320
So it's part of that double story,

2764
02:40:44.400 --> 02:40:46.280
remembrance of victims,

2765
02:40:46.360 --> 02:40:49.680
but not really bringing
those who were guilty


2766
02:40:49.760 --> 02:40:53.400
to account when they could
have done decades before.


2767
02:41:04.560 --> 02:41:07.400
- War crimes are acts and omissions

2768
02:41:07.480 --> 02:41:10.520
in violation of the
laws and customs of war.


2769
02:41:11.880 --> 02:41:16.320
The crime against humanity
is not so delimited.


2770
02:41:16.400 --> 02:41:18.480
It is fundamentally different

2771
02:41:18.560 --> 02:41:20.520
from the mere war crime

2772
02:41:20.600 --> 02:41:24.040
in that it embraces systematic violations

2773
02:41:24.120 --> 02:41:28.480
of fundamental human rights,
committed at any time,


2774
02:41:28.560 --> 02:41:30.480
against the nationals of any nation.

2775
02:41:31.680 --> 02:41:33.680
They may occur during peace or in war.

2776
02:41:38.920 --> 02:41:40.600
- I was born in Nuremberg, Germany,

2777
02:41:40.680 --> 02:41:44.240
and so I've grown up with hearing
about this my entire life.


2778
02:41:44.320 --> 02:41:46.760
My own sense is that justice,

2779
02:41:46.840 --> 02:41:49.240
in terms of retributive justice

2780
02:41:49.320 --> 02:41:52.240
and in terms of
restitution to the victims,


2781
02:41:52.320 --> 02:41:55.600
is never going to be what
we hope that it would be.


2782
02:41:55.680 --> 02:41:58.040
And of course, avoiding the slaughter,

2783
02:41:58.120 --> 02:42:01.080
avoiding the atrocities is
the most important thing


2784
02:42:01.160 --> 02:42:04.840
we can do as a matter of
justice for the victims.


2785
02:42:04.920 --> 02:42:07.760
Hopefully, assuring that
there are not further


2786
02:42:07.840 --> 02:42:10.760
similar atrocities and further victims.

2787
02:42:10.840 --> 02:42:12.960
It's impossible for me to say whether

2788
02:42:13.040 --> 02:42:16.720
what was done after the war
was satisfactory justice.


2789
02:42:16.800 --> 02:42:18.560
But I note this,

2790
02:42:18.640 --> 02:42:21.600
if we look back to the
Treaty of Westphalia,


2791
02:42:21.680 --> 02:42:23.760
upon which the entire European Nation

2792
02:42:23.840 --> 02:42:25.320
state system was founded,

2793
02:42:25.400 --> 02:42:28.720
it's a huge amnesty treaty,
if you go back and read it.


2794
02:42:28.800 --> 02:42:31.200
And we've seen even at Nuremberg,

2795
02:42:31.280 --> 02:42:33.600
not with the International
Military Tribunal,


2796
02:42:33.680 --> 02:42:37.040
but with all of the 12 subsequent
proceedings at Nuremberg,


2797
02:42:37.120 --> 02:42:41.880
by 1958, every one of the
convicted criminals was released


2798
02:42:41.960 --> 02:42:45.120
by the United States
back into German society


2799
02:42:45.200 --> 02:42:46.520
as part of a deal that was cut

2800
02:42:46.600 --> 02:42:48.440
with Konrad Adenauer's government

2801
02:42:48.520 --> 02:42:50.880
to reconstitute the
divisions of the German army


2802
02:42:50.960 --> 02:42:53.920
as a bulwark against Soviet expansion.

2803
02:42:54.000 --> 02:42:55.840
Where is the justice in that?

2804
02:43:00.640 --> 02:43:02.640
- Simon Wiesenthal always told

2805
02:43:04.440 --> 02:43:06.360
us young historians,

2806
02:43:06.440 --> 02:43:10.480
there was only one real
winner in the Cold War,


2807
02:43:10.560 --> 02:43:12.800
and this was the old Nazis.

2808
02:43:15.920 --> 02:43:19.280
- There's 5.4 million
people living in Yorkshire.


2809
02:43:19.360 --> 02:43:22.920
If the Nazis had killed the
entire population of Yorkshire,


2810
02:43:23.000 --> 02:43:24.736
what would the British
government have done then?


2811
02:43:24.760 --> 02:43:27.120
- Of course, the British
government would've pursued


2812
02:43:27.200 --> 02:43:29.880
every last criminal to
their last dying day.


2813
02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:35.400
But the Jews weren't that important.

2814
02:43:35.480 --> 02:43:37.080
They weren't important enough

2815
02:43:37.160 --> 02:43:39.760
for the British government
and the other Allies


2816
02:43:39.840 --> 02:43:43.920
to have that same level of political will

2817
02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:48.120
to ensure that justice was

2818
02:43:48.200 --> 02:43:50.680
done and pursued, and
that we never let up

2819
02:43:50.760 --> 02:43:53.520
on these most unbelievable crimes.

2820
02:43:55.520 --> 02:43:59.200
- Do you think any Holocaust
survivor has actually forgiven


2821
02:43:59.280 --> 02:44:01.400
the Nazis for what they did?

2822
02:44:01.480 --> 02:44:05.400
- No, I've never met
one Holocaust survivor


2823
02:44:05.480 --> 02:44:08.360
who forgiven the Nazis,
what they did, never.


2824
02:44:09.280 --> 02:44:12.200
I will never forgive
them as long as I live.


2825
02:44:13.640 --> 02:44:16.200
I lost 80 people, cousins, uncles,

2826
02:44:17.080 --> 02:44:18.880
parents, everybody,

2827
02:44:20.200 --> 02:44:21.200
from my family.

2828
02:44:22.400 --> 02:44:24.400
Is this justice?

2829
02:44:24.480 --> 02:44:25.480
- I've never

2830
02:44:26.600 --> 02:44:28.440
personally met a survivor

2831
02:44:29.320 --> 02:44:33.320
who has felt that justice has been done.

2832
02:44:34.800 --> 02:44:38.400
And I often think of

2833
02:44:38.480 --> 02:44:40.920
the words of Joseph Roth,

2834
02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:45.640
who was writing about another
tragedy at another time,


2835
02:44:45.720 --> 02:44:47.360
and this is what he wrote.

2836
02:44:48.040 --> 02:44:50.600
"When a catastrophe occurs,

2837
02:44:50.680 --> 02:44:53.880
"people at hand are
shocked into helpfulness.


2838
02:44:53.960 --> 02:44:58.360
"It seems that people expect
catastrophes to be brief,


2839
02:44:58.440 --> 02:45:02.720
"but chronic catastrophes are
so unpalatable to neighbors


2840
02:45:02.800 --> 02:45:05.080
"that they gradually
become indifferent to them


2841
02:45:05.160 --> 02:45:08.760
"and their victims, if
not downright impatient.


2842
02:45:08.840 --> 02:45:11.280
"The sense of order, regularity,

2843
02:45:11.360 --> 02:45:14.280
and due process is so ingrained in people

2844
02:45:14.360 --> 02:45:17.960
"that they're only willing
to entertain the opposite,


2845
02:45:18.040 --> 02:45:22.560
"emergency, madness, chaos, confusion,

2846
02:45:22.640 --> 02:45:24.600
"for a brief period.

2847
02:45:24.680 --> 02:45:27.200
"Once the emergency becomes protracted,

2848
02:45:27.280 --> 02:45:29.560
"helping hands return to pockets

2849
02:45:29.640 --> 02:45:32.280
"and the fires of compassion cool down."

2850
02:45:33.320 --> 02:45:36.160
And I think Roth really understands

2851
02:45:36.240 --> 02:45:38.160
and sets us all a challenge,

2852
02:45:38.240 --> 02:45:42.360
which is to be alive to
the suffering of others


2853
02:45:42.440 --> 02:45:44.800
and to care what happens about others

2854
02:45:44.880 --> 02:45:46.320
and not to be indifferent.

2855
02:45:52.400 --> 02:45:56.280
- Nowadays, we have to
deal with Holocaust denial.


2856
02:45:56.360 --> 02:45:57.480
We don't, thank goodness,

2857
02:45:57.560 --> 02:46:00.040
have to deal with Holocaust triumphalism.

2858
02:46:01.200 --> 02:46:03.080
So this is a great achievement,

2859
02:46:03.160 --> 02:46:06.080
that people deny the Holocaust,
they don't triumph it,


2860
02:46:06.160 --> 02:46:08.440
and you know, as sickening
that that might be.


2861
02:46:15.800 --> 02:46:19.280
- There were roughly

2862
02:46:19.360 --> 02:46:21.040
who were responsible for killing

2863
02:46:21.120 --> 02:46:22.600
one and a half million Jews,

2864
02:46:22.680 --> 02:46:25.800
yet only 200 were ever prosecuted, why?

2865
02:46:26.800 --> 02:46:27.960
- Oh, so many reasons.

2866
02:46:28.040 --> 02:46:31.440
Some of them good reasons,
some of them bad reasons.


2867
02:46:31.520 --> 02:46:32.840
The bad reasons,

2868
02:46:33.680 --> 02:46:34.720
because people didn't want

2869
02:46:34.760 --> 02:46:37.120
to confront the reality
of what had happened.


2870
02:46:37.200 --> 02:46:38.760
It was too awful.

2871
02:46:38.840 --> 02:46:40.800
It was much easier just to look ahead,

2872
02:46:40.880 --> 02:46:44.360
to look to the future
and not to look back.


2873
02:46:44.440 --> 02:46:47.040
Too many husbands, fathers, sons,

2874
02:46:47.120 --> 02:46:49.200
brothers had been involved.

2875
02:46:49.280 --> 02:46:50.880
A lot of the people responsible

2876
02:46:50.960 --> 02:46:53.560
for the killing were not German.

2877
02:46:53.640 --> 02:46:57.400
They were local people in the
Baltic states and elsewhere,


2878
02:46:57.480 --> 02:46:59.880
and it was very hard
for people to confront.


2879
02:46:59.960 --> 02:47:02.960
The good reasons, or the
less bad reasons, I suppose,


2880
02:47:03.880 --> 02:47:05.760
Europe was in a shocking state

2881
02:47:05.840 --> 02:47:07.136
at the end of the Second World War.

2882
02:47:07.160 --> 02:47:09.840
There were hundreds of thousands
of people without homes,


2883
02:47:09.920 --> 02:47:13.360
the displaced, who had
to be found new homes.


2884
02:47:13.440 --> 02:47:15.840
Borders were being redrawn.

2885
02:47:15.920 --> 02:47:17.480
The Cold War was beginning.

2886
02:47:17.560 --> 02:47:21.920
The Soviet Union was exerting its power.

2887
02:47:22.000 --> 02:47:25.600
Prosecuting those
responsible for the horrors


2888
02:47:25.680 --> 02:47:28.920
just didn't seem a priority at the time.

2889
02:47:29.000 --> 02:47:31.680
Justice wasn't done, plainly.

2890
02:47:31.760 --> 02:47:34.280
Justice often, it seems to me,

2891
02:47:34.360 --> 02:47:38.760
is regarded as a luxury
that people can't afford.


2892
02:47:38.840 --> 02:47:40.640
Mass murder

2893
02:47:41.680 --> 02:47:43.560
goes unpunished.

2894
02:48:23.920 --> 02:48:28.200
- It certainly is difficult
to quantify the effect today


2895
02:48:28.280 --> 02:48:30.200
on the Nuremberg trials.

2896
02:48:30.280 --> 02:48:33.800
I think the question as to
what was the intended effect


2897
02:48:33.880 --> 02:48:35.800
is a very important one

2898
02:48:35.880 --> 02:48:38.400
that is still very much
being wrestled with.


2899
02:48:38.480 --> 02:48:41.040
You will probably be
aware that at Nuremberg,


2900
02:48:41.120 --> 02:48:43.560
the defendants were tried for war crimes

2901
02:48:43.640 --> 02:48:45.440
and for crimes against humanity,

2902
02:48:45.520 --> 02:48:48.160
and in the eyes of some, most importantly,

2903
02:48:48.240 --> 02:48:51.120
crimes against peace, the
waging of aggressive war,


2904
02:48:51.200 --> 02:48:56.040
which Nuremberg branded as the
supreme international crime.


2905
02:48:56.120 --> 02:48:59.240
And the statements of Robert Jackson,

2906
02:48:59.320 --> 02:49:01.320
the American chief prosecutor,

2907
02:49:01.400 --> 02:49:03.480
were very, very compelling about

2908
02:49:03.560 --> 02:49:06.720
why the court was trying
the Nazi high command


2909
02:49:06.800 --> 02:49:08.960
for the crime of aggression.

2910
02:49:09.040 --> 02:49:10.096
He said, among other things,

2911
02:49:10.120 --> 02:49:13.160
that, "the common sense of mankind demands

2912
02:49:13.240 --> 02:49:16.240
"that law shall not
stop with the punishment


2913
02:49:16.320 --> 02:49:18.720
"of petty crimes by little people.

2914
02:49:18.800 --> 02:49:21.360
"It must also reach men

2915
02:49:21.440 --> 02:49:23.640
"who possess themselves of great power

2916
02:49:23.720 --> 02:49:26.600
"and make deliberate
and concerted use of it


2917
02:49:26.680 --> 02:49:30.840
"to set in motion evils
which leave no home


2918
02:49:30.920 --> 02:49:32.520
"in the world untouched."

2919
02:49:32.600 --> 02:49:36.720
The ultimate step in
avoiding periodic wars,


2920
02:49:36.800 --> 02:49:38.280
in which Robert Jackson said

2921
02:49:38.360 --> 02:49:41.600
are inevitable in a lawless world,

2922
02:49:41.680 --> 02:49:44.480
is to hold statesmen

2923
02:49:44.560 --> 02:49:46.120
accountable to law.

2924
02:49:46.200 --> 02:49:47.640
And he went on to say,

2925
02:49:47.720 --> 02:49:50.520
"Let me make clear that this law,"

2926
02:49:50.600 --> 02:49:54.360
which is now first being applied
against German aggressors,


2927
02:49:54.440 --> 02:49:56.640
"if it is to mean anything,

2928
02:49:56.720 --> 02:50:00.920
"must be applied in the
future against all nations."


2929
02:50:01.000 --> 02:50:02.320
And then he went on to say,

2930
02:50:02.400 --> 02:50:07.320
"including those who sit
here now in judgment."


2931
02:50:07.400 --> 02:50:10.760
So this is the true legacy
of Nuremberg pointing away


2932
02:50:10.840 --> 02:50:13.920
to a world where world leaders should know

2933
02:50:14.000 --> 02:50:16.160
that they will be held accountable.

2934
02:50:41.840 --> 02:50:44.720
The millions
murdered by the Nazis


2935
02:50:44.800 --> 02:50:48.880
and their collaborators will
soon reach their second death


2936
02:50:50.120 --> 02:50:53.040
where everyone who knew
them has also died.


2937
02:51:07.160 --> 02:51:08.760
Almost all of those murdered

2938
02:51:08.840 --> 02:51:12.760
became victims for a second time.

2939
02:51:14.760 --> 02:51:18.360
But this was not perpetrated
by people intent on evil acts,


2940
02:51:18.440 --> 02:51:21.240
but by the victors, the good guys,

2941
02:51:21.320 --> 02:51:24.000
who turned away and got
on with other things


2942
02:51:24.080 --> 02:51:27.240
and did not do everything in their power

2943
02:51:27.320 --> 02:51:30.320
to bring about justice
for all those murdered.


2944
02:51:40.120 --> 02:51:43.960
Their killers really did
get away with murder.


2945
02:51:55.880 --> 02:51:58.720
Throughout the three years that
I've been making this film,


2946
02:51:58.800 --> 02:52:00.280
I've often found myself wondering

2947
02:52:00.360 --> 02:52:03.360
if the warlords in Rwanda, or Bosnia,

2948
02:52:03.440 --> 02:52:07.080
Syria, Cambodia, Zaire, Darfur,

2949
02:52:07.160 --> 02:52:10.600
Indonesia, Myanmar, Russia,

2950
02:52:10.680 --> 02:52:14.320
did they paraphrase the
infamous Hitler speech,


2951
02:52:14.400 --> 02:52:16.480
"Who still speaks today

2952
02:52:16.560 --> 02:52:19.720
"about the justice for the Jews?"
