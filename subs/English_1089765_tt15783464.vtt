15
00:01:52.769 --> 00:01:55.039
You know you don't have to bring
that coffee in every day, Oxana.


16
00:01:55.072 --> 00:01:57.074
And pay four euro for the coffee

17
00:01:57.108 --> 00:01:58.910
that tastes of dirty water?

18
00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:01.645
Thanks.

19
00:02:03.881 --> 00:02:05.182
Hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm.

20
00:02:05.816 --> 00:02:08.019
-Affair?
-Yeah, take them to the client.


21
00:02:08.052 --> 00:02:10.087
See if he wants us to
continue the surveillance.


22
00:02:10.121 --> 00:02:11.956
-Sure.
-If he does,


23
00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:13.958
you follow her today.

24
00:02:17.962 --> 00:02:20.630
[reflective music]

25
00:02:47.091 --> 00:02:48.725
[Barber] Hey.

26
00:02:48.758 --> 00:02:51.561
-[Monica] You're late.
-Yeah. Sorry, parking.


27
00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.933
Kate's doing well,
considering the temporal damage


28
00:02:55.967 --> 00:02:58.535
done to her brain
in the accident.


29
00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.604
-Is it permanent?
-It's hard to say.


30
00:03:01.638 --> 00:03:03.207
Outcomes from brain injuries are

31
00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.542
notoriously difficult
to predict.


32
00:03:06.243 --> 00:03:09.146
And, um, what about
the shake in her hand?


33
00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.483
Likewise with the nerve damage,
we'll just have to wait and see.


34
00:03:13.951 --> 00:03:16.653
It's the thing that
irritates her the most.


35
00:03:16.686 --> 00:03:18.289
So, what happens now?

36
00:03:18.322 --> 00:03:20.992
Well, the good news is
that after six months with us,


37
00:03:21.025 --> 00:03:24.594
Kate is nearly
ready to be discharged.


38
00:03:24.627 --> 00:03:26.596
Um, Kate's care plan.

39
00:03:31.135 --> 00:03:32.937
It smelled in there.

40
00:03:34.138 --> 00:03:36.941
-So, what do you think?
-I don't like him. I never have.


41
00:03:36.974 --> 00:03:39.043
I'm not talking about him.

42
00:03:39.076 --> 00:03:41.745
We have to figure out
what happens now.


43
00:03:41.778 --> 00:03:44.748
Well, can't we just do what
we did when she was a kid?


44
00:03:44.781 --> 00:03:47.784
Will she even be able to
get up to town to you
at the weekend on her own?


45
00:03:47.818 --> 00:03:51.255
I'll come down for her.

46
00:03:51.288 --> 00:03:53.190
Tadhg hasn't been to visit
her for nearly two weeks.


47
00:03:53.224 --> 00:03:56.060
-No loss.
-He's still her boyfriend, Val.


48
00:03:56.093 --> 00:03:58.329
I don't know what
she sees in him.


49
00:03:58.362 --> 00:04:01.165
She sees the same thing every
teenage girl sees in a bad boy.


50
00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:06.971
What's her future gonna be now?

51
00:04:07.604 --> 00:04:09.106
She's resilient, Monica.

52
00:04:10.107 --> 00:04:12.243
Things will be better
when she's out of this place.


53
00:04:13.177 --> 00:04:15.146
Tell her I'll be in
this evening, will you?


54
00:04:15.179 --> 00:04:16.646
Yeah.

55
00:04:17.248 --> 00:04:18.315
See ya.

56
00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:19.616
See ya.

57
00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:22.552
[indistinct chatter]

58
00:04:30.194 --> 00:04:31.862
Kate, where's your mask?

59
00:04:35.698 --> 00:04:38.302
[poignant music]

60
00:04:46.877 --> 00:04:49.880
Let's go outside. These
masks are doing my head in.


61
00:04:53.918 --> 00:04:56.786
McDonogh's a patronizing dick,
isn't he?


62
00:04:56.821 --> 00:04:58.755
He's very pleased
with your progress.


63
00:04:58.788 --> 00:05:00.391
He said he'll be
discharging you soon.


64
00:05:00.424 --> 00:05:02.259
Yeah, and this?

65
00:05:02.293 --> 00:05:04.061
That will just take time.

66
00:05:05.429 --> 00:05:07.264
How are you
getting on otherwise?


67
00:05:07.965 --> 00:05:10.667
Well, I still
can't smell anything.


68
00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:13.703
I'm sleeping 14 hours a day.

69
00:05:13.736 --> 00:05:16.273
And my memory is crap
so, yeah, the same, Dad.


70
00:05:17.308 --> 00:05:19.210
[she laughs softly]
How about you?


71
00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:21.711
I've stopped smoking.

72
00:05:21.744 --> 00:05:23.280
[Kate scoffs]

73
00:05:23.314 --> 00:05:26.917
-Again?
-Yeah, well, for good this time.


74
00:05:26.951 --> 00:05:28.419
Mmm.

75
00:05:28.452 --> 00:05:30.020
Where's Mom?

76
00:05:30.821 --> 00:05:32.890
-She'll be coming in later.
-Mmm.


77
00:05:32.923 --> 00:05:35.725
Urgh! I hope she doesn't bring
Tom with her this time.


78
00:05:35.758 --> 00:05:38.028
-Tom's not so bad.
-But that's easy for you to say.


79
00:05:38.062 --> 00:05:40.763
You don't have
to live with him.


80
00:05:40.798 --> 00:05:42.299
[she sighs heavily]

81
00:05:42.333 --> 00:05:44.667
-How's the nightlife in here?
-Oh!


82
00:05:44.701 --> 00:05:46.736
It's out of this world.

83
00:05:51.008 --> 00:05:53.244
-Mrs. Dunne is here to see you.
-Who?


84
00:05:53.277 --> 00:05:55.012
You were to call her back.

85
00:05:59.116 --> 00:06:01.085
[he coughs]
How are you doing?


86
00:06:01.118 --> 00:06:03.087
Oh. Good day, Mr. Barber.

87
00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.089
I'm Lily Dunne.

88
00:06:05.122 --> 00:06:08.926
-My solicitor recommended you.
-OK.


89
00:06:08.959 --> 00:06:12.096
My granddaughter,
Sara Dunne, is missing.


90
00:06:14.798 --> 00:06:18.668
This should really be
a case for the Guards.


91
00:06:19.436 --> 00:06:22.239
-Have they been informed?
-Only after I insisted.


92
00:06:22.273 --> 00:06:25.309
Her mother's been in St. Pat's
since before lockdown.


93
00:06:25.342 --> 00:06:29.480
She's a drinker, I'm afraid.
Sara's father, my son, is dead.


94
00:06:29.513 --> 00:06:33.184
Her stepfather thinks
she's just gone on a skite.


95
00:06:33.884 --> 00:06:37.087
Well, to be honest, Mrs. Dunne,
like, most of my work, it's, uh,


96
00:06:37.121 --> 00:06:39.756
the insurance,
fraud that kind of thing.


97
00:06:39.789 --> 00:06:41.292
You said your solicitor
recommended me?


98
00:06:41.325 --> 00:06:43.726
Please, Mr. Barber,
I know what you're thinking.


99
00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:45.162
I'm just a fussy old woman

100
00:06:45.196 --> 00:06:47.965
worrying about
a misbehaving young girl.


101
00:06:48.966 --> 00:06:52.769
But where would she even go
at a time like this?


102
00:06:52.803 --> 00:06:54.405
I know something is wrong.

103
00:07:01.045 --> 00:07:04.081
Well, I suppose I am
a believer in intuition.


104
00:07:05.782 --> 00:07:09.186
My rate, it's 50 euro an hour
plus expenses.


105
00:07:11.055 --> 00:07:12.122
Well...

106
00:07:12.957 --> 00:07:14.992
Maybe not these days but, uh,

107
00:07:15.459 --> 00:07:19.997
as my late husband always
said, cash is king.


108
00:07:20.965 --> 00:07:22.166
Thank you.

109
00:07:30.874 --> 00:07:33.410
So, when was she last seen?
Sara Dunne, you said?


110
00:07:33.444 --> 00:07:37.881
Sara. Uh, in her home
about four days ago.


111
00:07:38.282 --> 00:07:40.851
And who was
the last person to see her?


112
00:07:40.884 --> 00:07:43.320
That would be her stepfather.

113
00:07:43.887 --> 00:07:45.923
Patrick Joseph O'Neill.

114
00:07:45.956 --> 00:07:49.360
[reflective music]

115
00:08:16.487 --> 00:08:18.322
[Luke] Hello, stranger.

116
00:08:18.355 --> 00:08:19.990
[Barber] Where have you been?

117
00:08:21.025 --> 00:08:22.259
Here and there.

118
00:08:24.261 --> 00:08:26.263
Are you not gonna ask me up?

119
00:08:26.297 --> 00:08:27.865
Yeah, come on.

120
00:08:59.129 --> 00:09:01.965
[romantic music]

121
00:09:06.403 --> 00:09:07.938
Come on in.

122
00:09:53.417 --> 00:09:55.319
-Come on. Ow!
-[both laughing]


123
00:09:55.352 --> 00:09:56.587
What's the rush?

124
00:10:00.057 --> 00:10:02.593
The boss is looking
for reasons to fire people.


125
00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.129
I don't want to give him one.

126
00:10:06.029 --> 00:10:07.931
-See ya.
-Yeah.


127
00:10:09.333 --> 00:10:11.935
See ya whenever, yeah?

128
00:10:11.969 --> 00:10:14.505
[reflective music]

129
00:10:38.729 --> 00:10:41.632
[daunting music]

130
00:10:53.343 --> 00:10:55.345
[barman] Who's gonna
give them a ticket, huh?


131
00:10:55.379 --> 00:10:57.514
-[Mulligan] Not me, anyway.
-No, by Jesus, they won't.


132
00:10:57.548 --> 00:10:59.516
-There's no police on this one.
-[Barber] How you doing?


133
00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:01.585
-[barman] Ah.
-[Mulligan] Well.


134
00:11:01.618 --> 00:11:03.153
-Can I get a coffee, please?
-[barman] Sure.


135
00:11:03.187 --> 00:11:04.655
Thanks.

136
00:11:04.688 --> 00:11:06.990
Days like this make
you long for the lockdown.


137
00:11:07.424 --> 00:11:09.693
All the little crims
locked up with Mammy.


138
00:11:11.628 --> 00:11:15.566
So, did you hear anything
on the, um, Dunne case?


139
00:11:16.266 --> 00:11:17.568
Mmm.

140
00:11:17.601 --> 00:11:19.570
-[barman] There you go.
-Thank you.


141
00:11:20.204 --> 00:11:22.139
Bit of a step up
in the world for you from


142
00:11:22.172 --> 00:11:24.074
catching wives doing the dirty.

143
00:11:26.043 --> 00:11:27.611
Tony Quinn is on it.

144
00:11:29.213 --> 00:11:30.514
You heard he made Inspector?

145
00:11:30.547 --> 00:11:32.182
Well, being on the take's

146
00:11:32.216 --> 00:11:34.284
still no impediment
to promotion then?


147
00:11:42.292 --> 00:11:43.560
[clears his throat]

148
00:11:43.594 --> 00:11:45.797
Anything else?

149
00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:48.098
I asked one of the lads on it.

150
00:11:48.131 --> 00:11:49.633
They're following procedure.

151
00:11:49.666 --> 00:11:52.569
Searched the house,
asked around.


152
00:11:52.603 --> 00:11:54.705
According to the stepfather,
she has form


153
00:11:54.738 --> 00:11:56.306
at this sort
of disappearing act.


154
00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:57.741
Wants it kept on the lowdown.

155
00:11:57.774 --> 00:11:59.510
What about her phone?

156
00:11:59.543 --> 00:12:02.212
-No sign of it.
-Bank accounts?


157
00:12:02.246 --> 00:12:07.251
She took a chunk of change out
on the 28th but nothing since.


158
00:12:09.219 --> 00:12:12.289
Look, going AWOL after two
months of lockdown ain't news.


159
00:12:13.123 --> 00:12:14.792
She'll turn up, mark my words.

160
00:12:14.826 --> 00:12:17.160
Jesus, Johnny, she's only 20.
Apart from the Granny,


161
00:12:17.194 --> 00:12:19.463
no one seems too concerned
about her at all.


162
00:12:21.131 --> 00:12:23.033
I'd sit tight if I was you.

163
00:12:28.672 --> 00:12:30.073
Nah.

164
00:12:30.107 --> 00:12:31.308
Again?

165
00:12:31.341 --> 00:12:33.076
[Barber chuckles]

166
00:12:36.848 --> 00:12:39.416
Does Quinn know that
the Dunnes have hired me?


167
00:12:39.449 --> 00:12:41.184
No, he doesn't.

168
00:12:44.621 --> 00:12:47.190
But I did hear the Inspector's
brother is back on the beat


169
00:12:47.224 --> 00:12:49.726
in Dublin after
a decade in the wilderness.


170
00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:52.563
-Eddie Quinn is back?
-Yeah.


171
00:12:53.798 --> 00:12:55.833
Clean and sober by all accounts.

172
00:12:59.202 --> 00:13:01.204
You know... [laughs]

173
00:13:01.238 --> 00:13:03.507
Even after all this time,
I still can't believe


174
00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:06.176
you never told me
what went down.


175
00:13:06.209 --> 00:13:08.445
Nothing to tell. We fell out.

176
00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:11.648
Come on, Val.

177
00:13:11.682 --> 00:13:14.484
Christ, it was years ago.
You know, just...


178
00:13:14.518 --> 00:13:16.353

179
00:13:18.856 --> 00:13:20.290

Were it only as exciting
as you think it is.


198
00:16:26.043 --> 00:16:29.713
Beats this. So, what skills
does a good detective need?


199
00:16:29.746 --> 00:16:33.517
Don't know. Guesswork,
a good pair of shoes.

My name's Val Barber.

206
00:17:14.025 --> 00:17:15.759
I was hired by
Sara Dunne's grandmother


207
00:17:15.793 --> 00:17:17.460
to look into her disappearance.

208
00:17:17.494 --> 00:17:18.996
Do you mind if
I ask you a few questions?


209
00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:21.398
No, I've already given
a statement to the Guards.


210
00:17:24.035 --> 00:17:26.770
The grandmother, she's very
worried about her, you know.


211
00:17:26.804 --> 00:17:28.906
Maybe I could buy you
a cup of coffee or something?

Look, I can't stay long.

[Barber]
<i>So when did you last see Sara?</i>


214
00:17:35.046 --> 00:17:38.015
Ages ago, like months.

215
00:17:38.648 --> 00:17:41.085
And how long had you two
been friends?


216
00:17:41.118 --> 00:17:43.054
Since school.

217
00:17:44.588 --> 00:17:47.058
Can you think
of any reason at all


218
00:17:47.091 --> 00:17:49.426
why she might have disappeared?

219
00:17:52.063 --> 00:17:54.564
Did she have a boyfriend?

220
00:17:54.598 --> 00:17:56.100
Yeah.

221
00:17:56.133 --> 00:17:57.935
Mine.

222
00:17:57.969 --> 00:18:02.006
After she slept with my
boyfriend, everyone hated her.


223
00:18:02.039 --> 00:18:04.075
Is that why
she dropped out of college?


224
00:18:05.009 --> 00:18:06.509
[laughs]

225
00:18:07.879 --> 00:18:09.914
Did she have her own boyfriend?

What about your boyfriend?

-What about him?
-Where is he now?

Back living in Cork
since the lockdown.


231
00:18:22.927 --> 00:18:25.495
A silver lining of sorts,
I suppose.


232
00:18:29.967 --> 00:18:32.435
Do you know how she
got on with her parents?


233
00:18:32.469 --> 00:18:34.171
[sighs] OK with her mom.

234
00:18:34.205 --> 00:18:36.673
-And the stepfather?
-She hates his guts.


235
00:18:36.706 --> 00:18:38.675
-Do you know why?
-Look.


236

OK? End of story.

just give me a call, yeah?

00:18:54.091 --> 00:18:55.425

[Barber] Hi.

243
00:19:22.954 --> 00:19:25.522
There was an incident
at the clinic last night.


244
00:19:26.723 --> 00:19:28.059
What happened?

245
00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:31.929
Well, she got upset, then angry.

246
00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:34.999
She wouldn't take
her medication.


247
00:19:35.032 --> 00:19:36.934
They had to sedate her.

248
00:19:39.036 --> 00:19:41.571
I don't even know how she is.
She refused to see me.


249
00:19:43.573 --> 00:19:46.776
Well, it's the injury, isn't it?
They said to expect this.


250
00:19:46.811 --> 00:19:48.712
Kate's always had a temper, Val.

251
00:19:48.745 --> 00:19:50.680
Poor Tom can testify to that.

252
00:19:53.084 --> 00:19:54.919
She still not
getting on with Tom?


253
00:19:56.020 --> 00:19:57.922
Well, he's not you, is he?

254

[he sighs]

255
00:20:06.063 --> 00:20:08.833
She's always blamed me
for the break-up, Val.


256
00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:16.007
-Why do you always do that?
-Do what?


257
00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:18.175
Stand up when things
get personal.


258
00:20:19.143 --> 00:20:21.178
It's almost like you're
getting ready to run.


259
00:20:21.212 --> 00:20:23.747
I need to get ready
if I'm going over to see her.


260
00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:25.615
Thanks for the coffee.

261
00:20:32.923 --> 00:20:33.991
Hey.

262
00:20:35.326 --> 00:20:36.927
What happened?

00:20:38.661 --> 00:20:39.830
Tadhg.

264
00:20:40.931 --> 00:20:42.599
He's met someone.

How do you know that?

266
00:20:44.634 --> 00:20:47.805
I'm still logged on to his
Facebook. I saw the messages.


267
00:20:49.306 --> 00:20:51.275
He told her he didn't
even have a girlfriend.

Because I'm only going
to say this once.


275
00:21:20.137 --> 00:21:22.106
The accident was your fault.

276

Mr. Barber, it wasn't my fault.
All right, this other guy--


277
00:21:24.809 --> 00:21:26.377
You were going too fast!

while my Kate is lying in...

I want you to show my daughter
some fucking respect!


282
00:21:34.819 --> 00:21:37.254
Yeah? Am I making myself clear?

Am I making myself clear?

Good.

285
00:21:42.393 --> 00:21:44.161
I'll be watching you.

00:21:48.265 --> 00:21:49.766
Who is he?

287
00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:53.938
Stepfather.
Last person to see her.

You think he's involved?

He hasn't returned
any of my calls.


290

I'm keeping an eye on him.

Watching him.

292
00:22:06.783 --> 00:22:09.386
You never told me why you left.

293
00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:11.122
Police very corrupt.

294
00:22:12.755 --> 00:22:14.358
Not just in Lithuania.

-You go on, I'll close up.
-You sure?

Yeah.

You, out.

299
00:22:44.955 --> 00:22:47.391
Would you look at what
the cat dragged in.


300
00:22:48.459 --> 00:22:51.395
Valentine Barber, no less.

301
00:22:53.264 --> 00:22:55.966
We received a report of
suspicious activity in the area.


302
00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.869
Would have thought house calls
were well below your rank,
Inspector.


303
00:22:58.903 --> 00:23:01.939
I know it was you snooping
around O'Neill's house
so don't bother denying it.


304
00:23:01.972 --> 00:23:04.341
As a former member, you
should know that impersonating


305
00:23:04.375 --> 00:23:07.444
a member of the Garda Siochana
is a very serious offense.


306
00:23:07.478 --> 00:23:09.246
Especially
if the said perpetrator


307
00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:11.348
-was dismissed from the force.
-I resigned.

I have been hired

-Your license?
-Seriously?

00:23:19.924 --> 00:23:21.358
Seriously.

No, social distancing,
Inspector.

Stay out my way if you know
what's good for you.

00:35:57.114 --> 00:35:59.050
OK, thanks. Um...

475
00:35:59.083 --> 00:36:01.618
Yeah, just see if
you can find, uh...


476
00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:04.889
Find out what you can
about a Brendan West.


477
00:36:04.922 --> 00:36:07.024
-Mm-hm.
-His number showed up
on Sara's phone.


478
00:36:07.058 --> 00:36:08.758
Yeah, just how many calls,

479
00:36:08.793 --> 00:36:10.828
what the times of the calls
are kind of thing.


480
00:36:14.131 --> 00:36:15.866
Cian Kelly?

481
00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:17.467
Val Barber.

482
00:36:17.902 --> 00:36:20.770
Making some inquiries into
Sara Dunne's disappearance.


483
00:36:20.805 --> 00:36:23.007
When did you last see Sara?

484
00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:26.543
Months ago. Look,
I already spoke to the Guards.


485
00:36:26.576 --> 00:36:29.646
Background information,
you know, on Sara's life.


486
00:36:29.679 --> 00:36:31.916
Talking to friends, family,
trying to fill in the gaps.


487
00:36:31.949 --> 00:36:33.550
It's just a few questions.

488
00:36:33.583 --> 00:36:35.853
You haven't given me
much choice, have you?


489
00:36:35.886 --> 00:36:37.787
Well, how long
were yous together?


490
00:36:37.822 --> 00:36:39.857
-A year.
-And what happened?


491
00:36:39.890 --> 00:36:42.059
[scoffs] Jane already
told you what happened.


492
00:36:42.093 --> 00:36:44.694
Well, I'm interested in
your version, not Jane's.


493
00:36:44.728 --> 00:36:46.097
It's the same shitty story.

494
00:36:46.130 --> 00:36:47.999
Sara fucked us both over.

495
00:36:48.032 --> 00:36:50.234
And would you say
that was out of character?


496
00:36:51.035 --> 00:36:54.205
Well, it was, until it wasn't,
if you get my meaning.


497
00:36:54.238 --> 00:36:56.107
Basic slut,
to be honest with you.


498
00:36:56.974 --> 00:36:59.910
-Did you ever meet her parents?
-Yeah, a few times.


499
00:36:59.944 --> 00:37:00.811
And?

500
00:37:01.711 --> 00:37:05.316
-And what?
-You don't seem too concerned.


501
00:37:05.349 --> 00:37:07.318
Yeah, well, I've moved on.

502
00:37:07.351 --> 00:37:11.989
Well, still a 20-year-old girl
is missing.


503
00:37:12.023 --> 00:37:16.760
Anyway, uh, do you ever think
maybe she cheated on you because


504
00:37:16.794 --> 00:37:20.197
you're a self-righteous,
self-absorbed prick?


505
00:37:57.734 --> 00:38:00.004
-[man] What would you like?
-What are you having?


506
00:38:00.037 --> 00:38:01.604
I'm having a gin martini.

507
00:38:01.638 --> 00:38:02.907
Same.

508
00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:04.641
[Jane laughs]

509
00:38:04.674 --> 00:38:05.876
Jane.

510
00:38:06.811 --> 00:38:08.979
-Excuse me?
-Who is this? Who are you?


511
00:38:09.013 --> 00:38:10.747
I'm sorry, who are you?

512
00:38:11.816 --> 00:38:13.716
Uh, I'm her father.

513
00:38:13.750 --> 00:38:15.652
[Jane scoffs]
He's not!


514
00:38:15.685 --> 00:38:18.089
Don't lie in front of your
Daddy. And you, beat it!


515
00:38:18.122 --> 00:38:20.191
Go on! You're old enough
to be her grandfather.


516
00:38:24.128 --> 00:38:26.831
Shouldn't an old codger
like you be at home cocooning?


517
00:38:33.838 --> 00:38:36.373
OK, Jane,
this is how it's going to be.


518
00:38:36.407 --> 00:38:38.075
You answer my questions

519
00:38:38.109 --> 00:38:41.245
or "Daddy" is going
to keep turning up.


520
00:38:42.179 --> 00:38:44.415
Now, you said you lost
all contact with Sara


521
00:38:44.448 --> 00:38:46.383
but I've seen her phone records.
You called her.


522
00:38:51.088 --> 00:38:52.389
I'm in no hurry.

523
00:38:54.358 --> 00:38:55.625
OK.

524
00:38:56.327 --> 00:38:58.395
She kept calling to apologize.

525
00:38:59.130 --> 00:39:01.398
It was lockdown,
there was nothing to do,


526
00:39:01.432 --> 00:39:03.267
so, yeah, I called her back.

527
00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:05.102
She never even
returned the call.


528
00:39:05.136 --> 00:39:06.769
End of story.

529
00:39:11.008 --> 00:39:14.111
Like I said, um,
I'm not in a hurry.


530
00:39:24.822 --> 00:39:28.259
Remember when
all that MeToo started?


531
00:39:28.292 --> 00:39:29.827
Mmm.

532
00:39:31.061 --> 00:39:34.731
Sara told me about stuff that
happened to her when she was 15.


533
00:39:34.764 --> 00:39:36.367
What kind of stuff?

534
00:39:37.268 --> 00:39:40.104
Shit stuff.

535
00:39:40.137 --> 00:39:43.240
Some business guy
wanked in front of her.


536
00:39:44.774 --> 00:39:47.178
Weird shit.

537
00:39:47.211 --> 00:39:49.246
Did she know this man?

538
00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:52.749
I think so. It happened at
a party in her parents' house.


539
00:39:52.782 --> 00:39:55.486
-So her stepfather knew him?
-She wouldn't say.


540
00:39:55.519 --> 00:39:57.488
She said she was going
to do something about it.


541
00:39:57.521 --> 00:40:00.357
-Like what?
-Go public.


542
00:40:00.391 --> 00:40:02.759
Like loads of women
are doing.


543
00:40:03.961 --> 00:40:05.930
I think we're done here.

544
00:40:07.231 --> 00:40:09.466
-Thanks for telling me.
-Mm-hm.


545
00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:12.369
Did, uh, did Sara ever do this?

546
00:40:12.403 --> 00:40:14.205
Do what?

547
00:40:14.238 --> 00:40:16.507
Did she have a sugar daddy?

548
00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:20.211
No. No, definitely not.

549
00:40:20.244 --> 00:40:22.346
Sex work can be dangerous,
you know.


550
00:40:24.448 --> 00:40:26.083
Especially now.

551
00:40:26.116 --> 00:40:27.750
That's not how I see it.

552
00:40:27.784 --> 00:40:29.453
Plenty of college girls do it.

553
00:40:31.188 --> 00:40:34.858
-If you think
of anything else...
-I know. Call you.


554
00:40:36.293 --> 00:40:37.995
Bye, Mr. Barber.

555
00:40:48.339 --> 00:40:49.807
So, um...

556
00:40:51.208 --> 00:40:53.244
heard something
on the grapevine.


557
00:40:53.277 --> 00:40:56.180
Mind you, it's only hearsay,
station gossip.


558
00:40:56.213 --> 00:40:58.349
Yeah, well,
I value station gossip.


559
00:40:59.316 --> 00:41:01.218
[chuckles]

560
00:41:01.252 --> 00:41:02.453
Well...

561
00:41:03.621 --> 00:41:06.323
One of the plodders said there's
been a couple of domestics


562
00:41:06.357 --> 00:41:07.958
at O'Neill's.

563
00:41:11.161 --> 00:41:12.196
Mmm.

564
00:41:14.498 --> 00:41:17.001
I met Quinn with O'Neill.

565
00:41:17.034 --> 00:41:19.203
Pair of them seemed very cozy.

566
00:41:19.236 --> 00:41:22.306
Inspector Quinn has always
had friends in high places.


567
00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:25.276
Friends in low places,
more like.


568
00:41:27.845 --> 00:41:30.014
You know how me Da
loved the poet Larkin?


569
00:41:30.047 --> 00:41:31.181
Yeah.

570
00:41:32.249 --> 00:41:34.084
Larkin said if you live
until you're 70,


571
00:41:34.118 --> 00:41:36.220
every decade
is like a day of the week.


572
00:41:40.190 --> 00:41:43.294
If it starts on a Monday
that puts me...


573
00:41:44.995 --> 00:41:47.564
-At Friday.
-Friday, yeah.


574
00:41:47.598 --> 00:41:49.066
Fuck.

575
00:41:50.601 --> 00:41:52.936
That thought'd put years on you.

[sighs] To be honest, I wasn't
that interested in her.

Did you ever come across
a fella called Brendan West?

Met him a few times socially.

A daughter, 19.

You married?

610

You're a lot better at asking
questions than answering them.

Well, that's my job.

been with O'Neill?

A while.

00:44:06.703 --> 00:44:09.106
He ever given you any trouble?

615
00:44:09.139 --> 00:44:11.041
What kind of trouble?

616
00:44:11.074 --> 00:44:13.177
The kind of trouble
that men usually give women.

want them to know I know.

00:45:35.425 --> 00:45:37.327
Are you not a bit young
for <i>Hill Street Blues?</i>


633
00:45:37.361 --> 00:45:39.263
I love those old shows.

634
00:45:40.163 --> 00:45:43.200
[coughs] So I...

635
00:45:44.134 --> 00:45:47.104
I met with Jane Devaney again
and, uh, she...


636
00:45:48.338 --> 00:45:50.607
Well, she had some stuff.

637
00:45:53.143 --> 00:45:55.379
It's not exactly pleasant,
so I'm sorry if...


638
00:45:55.412 --> 00:45:56.680
No, please.

639
00:45:56.713 --> 00:46:00.183
But she told me that

640
00:46:00.217 --> 00:46:05.689
Sara told her that
a man had masturbated


641
00:46:05.722 --> 00:46:10.193
in front of her at a party
in her house when she was 15.


642
00:46:11.395 --> 00:46:12.529
Jesus.

643
00:46:15.766 --> 00:46:17.301
Poor child.

644
00:46:19.236 --> 00:46:22.406
One of O'Neill's soirees,
no doubt.


645
00:46:22.439 --> 00:46:24.708
Did Jane know who the man was?

646
00:46:27.477 --> 00:46:29.746
Men like that often
have more than one victim.


647
00:46:29.780 --> 00:46:33.684
-Isn't that right, Mr. Barber?
-Yes.


648
00:46:33.717 --> 00:46:37.354
You think this man might be
linked to Sara's disappearance?


649
00:46:37.387 --> 00:46:40.123
It's a definite line of inquiry.

650
00:46:40.157 --> 00:46:41.725
And O'Neill?

651
00:46:41.758 --> 00:46:44.328
I don't know
but I'm watching him.


652
00:46:44.361 --> 00:46:49.166
O'Neill's boss at the time
was an unpleasant man.


653
00:46:49.199 --> 00:46:51.168
I met him socially once.

654
00:46:51.201 --> 00:46:53.737
O'Neill was in thrall to him.

655
00:46:53.770 --> 00:46:56.440
His name escapes me but, um,

656
00:46:56.473 --> 00:46:58.675
I believe he later
went into politics.


657
00:47:01.244 --> 00:47:03.513
OK. Well, don't worry,
I'll look into that.


658
00:47:06.316 --> 00:47:08.285
I want you to know

659
00:47:08.318 --> 00:47:10.787
that I appreciate all
you've been doing, Mr. Barber.


660
00:47:13.357 --> 00:47:16.493
[clicking]

661
00:47:17.394 --> 00:47:20.364
Only thing that woman loves
is shopping.


662
00:47:21.465 --> 00:47:24.601
[clicking]

663
00:47:28.271 --> 00:47:29.773
That one's clear as well.

664
00:47:29.807 --> 00:47:31.675
Have you heard any
clicks on your mobile?


665
00:47:32.910 --> 00:47:35.512
Do you think we are bugged?

666
00:47:35.545 --> 00:47:37.247
Well, my phone was tapped.

667
00:47:37.581 --> 00:47:40.217
So just use this
from now on. Here.


668
00:47:42.586 --> 00:47:45.222
I must be starting
to rattle some cages.


669
00:47:46.356 --> 00:47:47.557
And, um...

670
00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:52.797
I need you to follow
this man, Brendan West.


671
00:47:52.830 --> 00:47:54.731
Do you think he's connected?

672
00:47:54.765 --> 00:47:56.700
See if he meets up with O'Neill.

673
00:48:01.304 --> 00:48:03.774
[reflective music]

674
00:48:14.251 --> 00:48:16.520
[Monica] It's tough as it is
and then you have to
tell me something like that.


675
00:48:16.553 --> 00:48:19.456
-Look who it is.
-Yeah, I'm not blind, Mom.


676
00:48:19.489 --> 00:48:21.692
-Hey.
-Everything OK?


677
00:48:21.725 --> 00:48:23.226
Never better.

678
00:48:27.999 --> 00:48:29.533
Mom's pregnant.

679
00:48:30.802 --> 00:48:33.905
What is the need
for secrets in this family?


680
00:48:34.939 --> 00:48:37.574
There's no way I want to
live with you and Tom now.


681
00:48:37.607 --> 00:48:39.342
I want to live
with Dad full-time.


682
00:48:47.018 --> 00:48:49.987
If she's coming to live with
you, you need to tell her, Val.


683
00:48:50.021 --> 00:48:51.989
Oh, not this again,
please, Monica.


684
00:48:52.023 --> 00:48:54.491
So now you're gonna lie
to Kate the way you lied to me?


685
00:48:58.595 --> 00:49:00.832
What ended our marriage
wasn't just your relationship


686
00:49:00.865 --> 00:49:02.432
with Eddie Quinn.

687
00:49:03.667 --> 00:49:05.435
It was the lie.

688
00:49:08.538 --> 00:49:10.640
You never told me
who you really were.


689
00:49:10.674 --> 00:49:13.577
I didn't know who I really was.
You know I'm sorry for that.


690
00:49:13.610 --> 00:49:15.880
I didn't deliberately
lie to you, I just didn't
know how to tell you.


691
00:49:15.913 --> 00:49:17.815
Omission is lying.

692
00:49:17.849 --> 00:49:21.351
There's a big difference
between privacy and denial, Val.


693
00:49:21.384 --> 00:49:23.420
Are you pregnant?

694
00:49:23.453 --> 00:49:24.856
Yes.

695
00:49:26.323 --> 00:49:28.025
Congratulations.

696
00:49:28.059 --> 00:49:29.726
Thanks.

697
00:49:37.367 --> 00:49:38.468
You OK?

698
00:49:40.037 --> 00:49:42.339
People don't like
when you say real things.


699
00:49:44.008 --> 00:49:46.409
How do you mean?

700
00:49:46.443 --> 00:49:48.278
Well, you for a start.

701
00:49:50.747 --> 00:49:52.783
Why do you hide it
from me, Dad?


702
00:49:56.020 --> 00:49:59.623
I was 14 when I overheard
Mom and Tom arguing about you.


703
00:50:02.093 --> 00:50:03.727
Listen, the, um...

704
00:50:05.163 --> 00:50:08.765
the Ireland I grew up in
was a much different place
than it is now.


705
00:50:09.399 --> 00:50:10.935
Did Mom know
before you got married?


706
00:50:14.906 --> 00:50:16.439
Jesus Christ.

707
00:50:17.975 --> 00:50:20.610
I thought I could change myself
or something but...


708
00:50:22.046 --> 00:50:23.948
of course I couldn't.

709
00:50:27.384 --> 00:50:30.620
And I suppose
I didn't really want to.


710
00:50:31.488 --> 00:50:34.892
Yeah, well, When I was little,
I could never understand


711
00:50:34.926 --> 00:50:36.693
why you and Mom broke up.

712
00:50:36.726 --> 00:50:39.063
I used to think it was my fault.

713
00:50:42.732 --> 00:50:45.102
I'm sorry you had
to find out that way.


714
00:50:51.008 --> 00:50:54.912
[whirring]

715
00:51:06.623 --> 00:51:08.725
[Barber] Anything on West?

716
00:51:09.526 --> 00:51:10.627
No.

717
00:51:10.660 --> 00:51:13.164
He goes to work. Walk his dog.

718
00:51:13.197 --> 00:51:15.532
Go home. Very boring man.

719
00:51:15.565 --> 00:51:17.168
Well, stay on him.

720
00:51:17.201 --> 00:51:19.837
This man here
is a Government Minister.


721
00:51:19.871 --> 00:51:21.471
-Eunan Brady.
-Right.


722
00:51:21.504 --> 00:51:23.975
You stick on West,
see if he meets with him,


723
00:51:24.008 --> 00:51:26.110
or this man, O'Neill.

724
00:51:29.213 --> 00:51:31.514
-A big man.
-Yeah.


725
00:51:32.083 --> 00:51:33.583
Big men.

726
00:51:34.852 --> 00:51:37.721
[Mulligan] The only people are
gonna survive are the big boyos.


727
00:51:37.754 --> 00:51:39.789
-And what about yourself?
-[laughs]


728
00:51:39.824 --> 00:51:41.959
Be taking me
out of here in a box.


729
00:51:41.993 --> 00:51:43.693
[laughs]

730
00:51:46.596 --> 00:51:51.102
Did you, uh, did you hear
any rumors about Eunan Brady?


731
00:51:52.535 --> 00:51:54.571
What, the Minister?

732
00:51:55.206 --> 00:51:57.108
What kind, like?

733
00:51:57.808 --> 00:51:59.709
What other kind
are there these days?


734
00:51:59.743 --> 00:52:01.711
Nah.

735
00:52:01.745 --> 00:52:02.980
Not a peep.

736
00:52:05.548 --> 00:52:09.786
I've a bit of news
that might interest you.


737
00:52:09.820 --> 00:52:14.658
Eddie Quinn told the lads in
his new station that he's gay.


738
00:52:15.993 --> 00:52:19.163
Word went around like wildfire.

739
00:52:19.196 --> 00:52:20.965
Now everyone knows about it.

740
00:52:22.766 --> 00:52:24.668
The Inspector's raging about it,

741
00:52:24.701 --> 00:52:26.770
the boys were telling me.

742
00:52:26.804 --> 00:52:29.506
Going around the place
like a bull in a china shop.


743
00:52:31.242 --> 00:52:34.544
Eddie is real open
about it apparently.


744
00:52:38.082 --> 00:52:39.449
Jesus!

745
00:52:40.550 --> 00:52:42.652
A hard drinking fella
like Eddie Quinn. [chuckles]


746
00:52:43.955 --> 00:52:45.755
You never fucking know, do you?

747
00:52:45.789 --> 00:52:48.159
Aye, I know, I mean...

748
00:52:48.192 --> 00:52:50.194
What should it matter, like?

749
00:52:50.962 --> 00:52:52.897
I'm not saying it matters.

750
00:52:55.866 --> 00:52:58.869
You know, I've never cared,
Val, right?


751
00:52:58.903 --> 00:53:00.871
[phone ringing]

752
00:53:03.107 --> 00:53:04.541
Mm-hm.

753
00:53:06.743 --> 00:53:09.113
Oh, Jesus, I have to go.

754
00:53:11.048 --> 00:53:12.782
It's a date night.

755
00:53:13.884 --> 00:53:15.920
Did you ever hear
the like of it?


756
00:53:21.658 --> 00:53:22.860
Mr. O'Neill.

757
00:53:22.893 --> 00:53:24.862
As you won't answer my calls

758
00:53:24.895 --> 00:53:26.529
and you were the last person
to see Sara,


759
00:53:26.563 --> 00:53:28.232
I was wondering
if I could just ask you


760
00:53:28.265 --> 00:53:31.168
a couple more questions about
her, a few simple questions.


761
00:53:31.202 --> 00:53:34.071
Can I ask you
about your relationship
with Minister Eunan Brady?


762
00:53:36.639 --> 00:53:38.541
Did that hurt or something?

763
00:53:38.575 --> 00:53:41.611
Charlie Haughey once said he
could instance all the fuckers


764
00:53:41.644 --> 00:53:43.214
whose throats he'd cut

765
00:53:43.247 --> 00:53:45.082
and pushed them over
the nearest cliffs,


766
00:53:45.116 --> 00:53:46.984
but there was
no percentage in it.


767
00:53:47.018 --> 00:53:48.919
Now, I'm beginning to feel

768
00:53:48.953 --> 00:53:51.288
exactly the same way
about you, Barber.


769
00:53:51.322 --> 00:53:53.090
Am I making myself clear? Am I?

770
00:53:53.124 --> 00:53:54.258
Yeah.

771
00:53:54.291 --> 00:53:56.293
Gaaah! Fuck!

772
00:54:03.633 --> 00:54:06.636
[wheezing and coughing]

773
00:54:10.074 --> 00:54:12.877

[gentle music]

775
00:55:02.026 --> 00:55:03.726
Well, you know.

776
00:55:03.760 --> 00:55:05.796
[chuckles]

777
00:55:12.669 --> 00:55:14.704
Mom's coming for dinner.

778
00:55:14.737 --> 00:55:16.140
Without Tom.

779
00:55:17.808 --> 00:55:20.077
-Can I help?
-No, you're OK.


780
00:55:20.111 --> 00:55:22.313
Jesus, Dad, I can chop peppers.

781
00:55:22.980 --> 00:55:24.849
-OK.
-Thank you.


782
00:55:29.954 --> 00:55:32.823
[knife scraping]

783
00:55:37.795 --> 00:55:39.096
[bowl crashing]

784
00:55:40.331 --> 00:55:41.731
[she sighs]

785
00:55:42.166 --> 00:55:43.868
Um, don't worry about that.

786
00:55:43.901 --> 00:55:45.668
Here, uh...

787
00:55:57.348 --> 00:55:58.849
I hate what's happened to me.

788
00:56:02.920 --> 00:56:04.421
You just need to keep trying.

789
00:56:04.455 --> 00:56:05.923
OK?

790
00:56:05.956 --> 00:56:07.858
You're making real progress.

791
00:56:07.892 --> 00:56:09.360
-[she sighs]
-You really are.


792
00:56:09.393 --> 00:56:10.760
Mmm.

793
00:56:20.104 --> 00:56:21.372
[she sighs]

794
00:56:24.074 --> 00:56:25.742
How are you feeling?

795
00:56:25.775 --> 00:56:27.478
OK.

796
00:56:27.511 --> 00:56:29.712
Bit of morning sickness.

797
00:56:29.746 --> 00:56:32.449
Do you remember how
sick you were with Kate?


798
00:56:32.483 --> 00:56:35.219
-I'll never forget it.
-OK, OK.


799
00:56:35.252 --> 00:56:37.720
I get what you two are doing.

800
00:56:38.989 --> 00:56:40.257
Look, Mom...

801
00:56:41.425 --> 00:56:44.195
I know how much you
always wanted another kid.


802
00:56:45.863 --> 00:56:48.165
It's just...
[soft whimper]


803
00:56:54.771 --> 00:56:56.373
I understand, love.

804
00:57:05.950 --> 00:57:07.084
[Monica sighs]

805
00:57:08.319 --> 00:57:09.520
OK, but...

806
00:57:09.553 --> 00:57:11.322
I'm gonna go to bed.

807
00:57:11.355 --> 00:57:13.357
I'm tired. Goodnight, you two.

808
00:57:13.390 --> 00:57:14.757
Goodnight.

809
00:57:14.791 --> 00:57:16.060
Goodnight, love.

810
00:57:19.430 --> 00:57:21.298
I am happy for you, Monica.

811
00:57:22.533 --> 00:57:24.435
Yeah, I know you are.

812
00:57:25.502 --> 00:57:27.838
It just couldn't be
coming at a worse time.


813
00:57:27.871 --> 00:57:29.940
She's gonna be fine here.

814
00:57:31.141 --> 00:57:32.943
Sure, she adores you.

815
00:57:32.977 --> 00:57:34.945
You can do no wrong in her eyes.

816
00:57:34.979 --> 00:57:36.847
[Barber laughing]
I don't know about that!


817
00:57:37.548 --> 00:57:42.253
-Did you tell her?
-More like she told me.


818
00:57:42.286 --> 00:57:45.956
She overheard you and Tom
arguing. She's known for years.


819
00:57:45.990 --> 00:57:47.191
Christ!

820
00:57:47.224 --> 00:57:49.059
What did she say?

821
00:57:49.093 --> 00:57:51.996
-She didn't hold back.
-Good for her.


822
00:57:52.029 --> 00:57:54.131
I didn't raise her
to hold her tongue.


823
00:57:56.267 --> 00:57:59.403
I know I ended up causing
you both a lot of pain.


824
00:58:01.405 --> 00:58:05.509
You also brought us a lot of
joy and a lot of love, Val.


825
00:58:09.013 --> 00:58:11.048
We'll get through this.

826
00:58:11.448 --> 00:58:13.150
We always have.

827
00:58:22.593 --> 00:58:25.462
-Eddie Quinn is here to see you.
-Eddie?


828
00:58:32.503 --> 00:58:34.204
Long time, no see.

829
00:58:35.372 --> 00:58:36.940
Long time.

830
00:58:42.146 --> 00:58:43.614
You look good, Val.

831
00:58:43.647 --> 00:58:46.150
Looking good yourself.

832
00:58:46.183 --> 00:58:47.584
Yeah, sit down.

833
00:58:54.992 --> 00:58:57.895
So how's the private game going?

834
00:58:57.928 --> 00:58:59.596
Private.

835
00:59:01.498 --> 00:59:03.200
I always meant to get in touch.

836
00:59:05.169 --> 00:59:07.004
After we...

837
00:59:07.037 --> 00:59:09.173
you know,

838
00:59:09.206 --> 00:59:11.642
I just went
a bit mad on the drink.


839
00:59:11.675 --> 00:59:14.244
-Hmm.
-Had a couple of bad years.


840
00:59:18.515 --> 00:59:19.550
Look...

841
00:59:21.285 --> 00:59:24.988
Tony backed me into a corner.

842
00:59:25.022 --> 00:59:27.324
My only way out
was to give you up.


843
00:59:28.659 --> 00:59:30.260
I'd no choice.

844
00:59:31.995 --> 00:59:34.198
What we had between us
was real, Val.


845
00:59:36.233 --> 00:59:37.668
There's nothing
to be ashamed about.


846
00:59:37.701 --> 00:59:39.937
That's not how shame works.

847
00:59:43.006 --> 00:59:44.908
You know, you really
don't have to come here


848
00:59:44.942 --> 00:59:46.543
to make amends to me.

849
00:59:46.577 --> 00:59:48.579
I do.

850
00:59:48.612 --> 00:59:49.646
For me.

851
00:59:52.416 --> 00:59:54.051
And I feel I owe you.

852
00:59:57.254 --> 00:59:59.523
You probably heard
I was in rehab.


853
01:00:00.958 --> 01:00:03.927
Well, I realized that
the biggest of all my demons


854
01:00:03.961 --> 01:00:05.662
was not the drink.

855
01:00:05.696 --> 01:00:07.498
It was living a lie.

856
01:00:07.531 --> 01:00:09.500
Now, surely, you of all people,
haven't come here


857
01:00:09.533 --> 01:00:12.002
to give me a lesson
on the dangers of erasure.


858
01:00:12.035 --> 01:00:13.437
It's about being truthful.

859
01:00:13.470 --> 01:00:17.074
And what about
big brother Tony?


860
01:00:17.107 --> 01:00:20.043
Has he accepted "the truth"?

861
01:00:25.115 --> 01:00:29.319
Uh... Good to see
the old Val hasn't changed.


862
01:00:29.353 --> 01:00:30.487
Mmm.

863
01:00:30.521 --> 01:00:32.523
You still seeing
any of the lads?


864
01:00:33.524 --> 01:00:36.059
I see Johnny Mulligan
quite a bit actually.


865
01:00:38.295 --> 01:00:41.331
-Yeah? How is he?
-Same as ever.


866
01:00:42.232 --> 01:00:45.068
Yeah, his dad died there
a while back.


867
01:00:45.102 --> 01:00:47.404
-He took it pretty hard.
-Oh.


868
01:00:49.573 --> 01:00:51.675
I've really missed Dublin.

869
01:00:51.708 --> 01:00:53.544
How's the country?

870
01:00:53.577 --> 01:00:55.212
[chuckles]

Slim pickings.

872
01:00:58.182 --> 01:01:00.083
You seeing anyone?

873
01:01:00.117 --> 01:01:02.119
Um... Are you?

874
01:01:04.188 --> 01:01:06.190
Nothing serious.

875
01:01:06.223 --> 01:01:07.958
Playing the field.

876
01:01:08.692 --> 01:01:13.163
Ah, sure, this new woke Ireland
is certainly working for me.


877
01:01:21.405 --> 01:01:24.374
[gentle music]

878
01:01:48.532 --> 01:01:49.566
Froggy.

879
01:01:50.601 --> 01:01:52.369
How you doing?

880
01:01:52.402 --> 01:01:54.705
Val Barber.
Long time, no see, boss.


881
01:01:55.840 --> 01:01:58.275
Rumor has it you're
a private dick now.


882
01:01:58.308 --> 01:01:59.209
Yeah.

883
01:02:01.245 --> 01:02:03.514
I wanted to talk to you
about Eunan Brady.


884
01:02:05.148 --> 01:02:06.683
I think he...

885
01:02:06.717 --> 01:02:09.620
I think he's connected to
a missing girl case that I'm on.


886
01:02:10.487 --> 01:02:12.089
That dirt bird.

887
01:02:14.758 --> 01:02:17.728
About three years back,

888
01:02:17.761 --> 01:02:20.130
a woman came into the station.

889
01:02:20.163 --> 01:02:24.301
Said that Brady had assaulted
her, jerked off on her.


890
01:02:27.371 --> 01:02:29.807
I was about to approach Brady,

891
01:02:29.841 --> 01:02:33.777
when all of a sudden, the woman
withdraws the statement.


892
01:02:33.811 --> 01:02:35.746
Someone had got to her.

893
01:02:38.482 --> 01:02:40.317
I approached Quinn.

894
01:02:42.419 --> 01:02:44.187
What had Quinn
got to do with it?


895
01:02:44.221 --> 01:02:46.256
Quinn was my senior.

896
01:02:46.290 --> 01:02:48.258
I reported back to him.

897
01:02:48.292 --> 01:02:50.527
Do you still have her details?

898
01:02:50.561 --> 01:02:51.796
Yeah.

899
01:02:51.829 --> 01:02:53.463
[coughs]

900
01:02:53.497 --> 01:02:56.300
Thanks, I appreciate it.

901
01:02:56.333 --> 01:02:59.570
I'll keep it on the q.t.

902
01:02:59.603 --> 01:03:01.738
There's no need to.
I'm finished.


903
01:03:02.807 --> 01:03:05.075
They're going to
stick me on traffic.


904
01:03:07.578 --> 01:03:09.079
You know, Val,

905
01:03:10.380 --> 01:03:12.683
they'd never get away today

906
01:03:12.716 --> 01:03:15.820
with the way
they treated you back then.


907
01:03:15.853 --> 01:03:17.889
You think so?

908
01:03:17.922 --> 01:03:19.189
Absolutely.

909
01:03:37.407 --> 01:03:39.209
Miss Farrell,
my name is Val Barber.


910
01:03:39.242 --> 01:03:40.878
I'm a private investigator.
I, um...


911
01:03:40.912 --> 01:03:43.447
I wanted to ask you a few
questions about Eunan Brady.


912
01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:45.315
No. No, sorry.

913
01:03:45.349 --> 01:03:48.719
The same thing
happened to this girl,


914
01:03:50.287 --> 01:03:51.788
except she's missing now.

915
01:03:52.789 --> 01:03:55.125
Her grandmother
is desperate to find her.


916
01:03:57.962 --> 01:03:59.596
Miss Farrell.

917
01:03:59.630 --> 01:04:02.199
Um... Here's my card.
My number's on there.


918
01:04:02.232 --> 01:04:03.700
Just call me if you
think of anything.


919
01:04:03.734 --> 01:04:04.869
OK.

920
01:04:07.571 --> 01:04:09.439

Out you get.

924
01:04:35.867 --> 01:04:37.835
Why am I being
stopped and searched?


925
01:04:37.869 --> 01:04:39.369
A tip off.

926
01:04:39.937 --> 01:04:42.506
This is bullshit
and you know it is.


927
01:04:42.539 --> 01:04:44.741
Not exactly the best use
of police resources, is it,


928
01:04:44.775 --> 01:04:46.978
when you're supposed to be
looking for a missing girl?


929
01:04:47.011 --> 01:04:48.679
How much is O'Neill paying you?

930
01:04:48.712 --> 01:04:50.514
What's he paying you for?

931
01:04:50.948 --> 01:04:52.649
You just say away from Eddie.

932
01:04:52.683 --> 01:04:54.852
It's your fault
he shames the whole family,


933
01:04:54.886 --> 01:04:57.889
mincing around with a different
twink on his arm every week.


934
01:04:57.922 --> 01:05:00.290
Do you think Eddie
wasn't gay before he met me?


935
01:05:00.323 --> 01:05:02.292
Your kind make me sick.

936
01:05:02.325 --> 01:05:04.428
You don't know whether you want
to fuck a man or a woman.


937
01:05:04.461 --> 01:05:06.630
And what about you?
What are you into yourself?


938
01:05:06.663 --> 01:05:08.198
Back the fuck off!

939
01:05:08.900 --> 01:05:11.401

941
01:05:15.973 --> 01:05:18.341
This is police harassment.

Yes. Pepperoni, please.

955
01:06:02.987 --> 01:06:05.322
I thought you were vegetarian.

956
01:06:05.355 --> 01:06:06.924
-I am.
-Oh, yeah?


957
01:06:06.958 --> 01:06:09.927
-A pepperoni-eating vegetarian.
-[they laugh]


958
01:06:09.961 --> 01:06:13.330
-Nice. So, pepperoni and...?
-[Kate] The same.


959
01:06:13.363 --> 01:06:16.033
-Easy!
-[girls laughing]


960
01:06:16.067 --> 01:06:18.970
[reflective music]

961
01:06:24.608 --> 01:06:27.544
[voicemail]
<i>Mr. Barber, Eliza Farrell here.</i>


962
01:06:28.411 --> 01:06:30.882
<i>I'd like to talk about</i>
<i>Minister Eunan Brady.</i>


963
01:06:31.615 --> 01:06:33.517
[Barber] <i>Thanks for</i>
<i>agreeing to talk to me.</i>


964
01:06:33.550 --> 01:06:34.684
<i>I know this is hard.</i>

965
01:06:37.021 --> 01:06:39.790
When did you first come
into contact with Mr. Brady?


966
01:06:42.392 --> 01:06:45.295
My dad was site foreman
in his building company.


967
01:06:45.863 --> 01:06:48.565
He got me a summer job
interning in his office.


968
01:06:49.399 --> 01:06:51.701
I was 17.

969
01:06:52.904 --> 01:06:54.071
Go on.

970
01:06:58.642 --> 01:07:02.980
Mr. Brady masturbated in
front of me in the print room.


971
01:07:06.150 --> 01:07:07.885
I was terrified.

972
01:07:08.752 --> 01:07:11.321
I couldn't tell my parents.

973
01:07:13.623 --> 01:07:15.325
I went to the police.

974
01:07:17.427 --> 01:07:21.531
He tried it again and I told him
I'd gone to the police,


975
01:07:21.565 --> 01:07:23.567
and he freaked out.

976
01:07:26.838 --> 01:07:28.806
A man came to see me.

977
01:07:30.674 --> 01:07:34.711
He said that there
would be all this publicity.


978
01:07:34.744 --> 01:07:36.713
That my dad would lose his job.

979
01:07:39.449 --> 01:07:41.451
I withdrew my statement.

980
01:07:45.689 --> 01:07:47.757
Is this the man
who approached you?


981
01:07:54.799 --> 01:07:56.834
That's him, yeah.

982
01:08:00.137 --> 01:08:01.738
Brendan West.

983
01:08:03.140 --> 01:08:06.443
Can I ask you what made you
change your mind about
talking to me?


984
01:08:06.476 --> 01:08:07.677
[she sighs]

985
01:08:08.445 --> 01:08:10.480
I thought about
the missing girl.


986
01:08:25.096 --> 01:08:26.696
[Barber] Are you OK?

987
01:08:28.732 --> 01:08:30.667
[Kate crying]

988
01:08:30.700 --> 01:08:32.837
Me and Amy went to town.

989
01:08:34.906 --> 01:08:37.208
It was just too much.

990
01:08:37.241 --> 01:08:39.143
The noise and the people.

991
01:08:39.176 --> 01:08:42.679
She had to bring me home.
Now she thinks that I'm a freak.


992
01:08:43.613 --> 01:08:45.149
No, she doesn't.

993
01:08:47.084 --> 01:08:48.718
Because you're not.

994
01:08:48.752 --> 01:08:51.088
It's... It's so hard.

995
01:08:51.122 --> 01:08:53.757
[crying]

996
01:08:55.026 --> 01:08:57.661
It'll be better next time.

997
01:08:57.694 --> 01:08:59.030
How do you know?

998
01:08:59.063 --> 01:09:00.697
Because I know you.

999
01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:13.443
You know, I was thinking what
you were saying about secrets.


1000
01:09:15.012 --> 01:09:16.579
And, uh...

1001
01:09:17.514 --> 01:09:21.919
In the past when people
found out about me...


1002
01:09:24.754 --> 01:09:26.723
it never worked out well.

1003
01:09:29.726 --> 01:09:31.561
So I didn't say anything...

1004
01:09:33.097 --> 01:09:35.099
because I didn't want
to lose you either.


1005
01:09:38.269 --> 01:09:40.137
And I'm sorry about that.

1006
01:09:45.608 --> 01:09:47.044
Can I ask you something?

1007
01:09:47.078 --> 01:09:49.146
You can ask me anything.

1008
01:09:49.679 --> 01:09:52.183
Did you ever, like, come out?

1009
01:09:52.216 --> 01:09:53.918
[laughs softly]

1010
01:09:54.651 --> 01:09:56.786
I've always hated that phrase.

1011
01:09:56.821 --> 01:09:59.756
It doesn't matter
about the phrase.


1012
01:09:59.789 --> 01:10:00.992
[she sighs]

1013
01:10:02.326 --> 01:10:03.693
No, you're right.

1014
01:10:08.265 --> 01:10:11.735
I should have been honest
with your mother, with you.


1015
01:10:17.274 --> 01:10:19.210
It's OK, Dad.

1016
01:10:21.979 --> 01:10:24.148
You're coming out now.

1017
01:10:30.121 --> 01:10:32.990
Brendan West. Val Barber.
Private investigator.


1018
01:10:33.024 --> 01:10:34.959
I'm working on
a missing person's case.


1019
01:10:34.992 --> 01:10:36.626
I'd like to ask you
a few questions.


1020
01:10:36.659 --> 01:10:39.296
Only Gardai can question
a member of the public.


1021
01:10:39.330 --> 01:10:41.631
Was it your job
to go after Sara Dunne


1022
01:10:41.664 --> 01:10:44.001
-the same way you went
after Eliza Farrell?
-No comment.


1023
01:10:44.035 --> 01:10:46.303
You'll have to do a better job
than that when the police
are interviewing you.


1024
01:10:46.337 --> 01:10:48.705
Your number was tracked
to Sara Dunne's phone.


1025
01:10:48.738 --> 01:10:51.142
What were you doing calling
a 20-year-old missing girl,
Mr. West?


1026
01:10:51.175 --> 01:10:53.777
-I said no comment.
-As Brady's bag man,


1027
01:10:53.811 --> 01:10:57.281
you do realize if anything
happens to that girl
you're connected?


1028
01:11:06.656 --> 01:11:08.059
Look, Val,

1029
01:11:09.193 --> 01:11:11.328
that's it with the favors
on this one, okay?


1030
01:11:11.362 --> 01:11:15.132
Information is leaking
out of the investigation
like an old sieve.


1031
01:11:18.235 --> 01:11:21.771
I don't want any trouble.

1032
01:11:21.806 --> 01:11:23.773
-Thanks, Johnny.
-No worries.


1033
01:11:27.178 --> 01:11:29.180
Just be careful, OK?

1034
01:11:29.947 --> 01:11:33.217
Quinn... [laughs]
He's definitely on the warpath.


1035
01:11:34.684 --> 01:11:37.054
[reflective music]

1036
01:12:10.821 --> 01:12:11.989
[Lexie] Hey.

1037
01:12:12.022 --> 01:12:13.157
[Barber] Hi.

1038
01:12:14.859 --> 01:12:16.360
Come in.

1039
01:12:16.994 --> 01:12:18.162
[Lexie laughs]

1040
01:12:18.195 --> 01:12:19.230
Moving in?

1041
01:12:19.263 --> 01:12:21.065
Redecorating.

1042
01:12:21.098 --> 01:12:25.136
Some unexpected visitors
or half expected.


1043
01:12:26.470 --> 01:12:28.105
I owe you an apology.

1044
01:12:28.139 --> 01:12:31.008
Oh, yeah? What for?

1045
01:12:31.041 --> 01:12:32.742
For trying to warn me about him.

1046
01:12:32.775 --> 01:12:34.912
-Did he try to hurt you?
-No.


1047
01:12:35.913 --> 01:12:37.848
Um...

1048
01:12:37.882 --> 01:12:39.884
But he could have.

1049
01:12:40.251 --> 01:12:42.019
He'd always been so charming.

1050
01:12:42.052 --> 01:12:44.421
They always are until...

1051
01:12:45.222 --> 01:12:48.993
they're challenged or they think
they're gonna lose control.


1052
01:12:49.894 --> 01:12:50.928
Well...

1053
01:12:52.329 --> 01:12:54.932
he's definitely lost me now.

1054
01:12:57.067 --> 01:13:01.005
Um... How about
I buy you dinner sometime?


1055
01:13:03.307 --> 01:13:04.975
Yeah, that'd be nice.

1056
01:13:05.009 --> 01:13:06.743
[laughs softly]

1057
01:13:27.164 --> 01:13:28.899

-[phone ringing]
-Yeah?

[Oxana] <i>Listen, Brady</i>
<i>in Blooms Hotel tonight</i>


1064
01:14:59.390 --> 01:15:01.091
<i>-for raise of funds.</i>
-Fundraiser, yeah.


1065
01:15:01.125 --> 01:15:03.260
<i>OK. You want I cover?</i>

1066
01:15:03.294 --> 01:15:05.062
No, no, I'll handle it.

1067
01:15:05.095 --> 01:15:06.797
OK, thanks.

1068
01:15:28.585 --> 01:15:30.220
S.D.U.

1069
01:15:30.254 --> 01:15:32.890
I have a message for him
from the Commissioner.


1070
01:15:39.596 --> 01:15:41.532
It's only a matter of time...

1071
01:15:42.533 --> 01:15:44.435
before you're exposed.

1072
01:15:45.369 --> 01:15:48.172
If you'll forgive the pun,
Minister.


1073
01:15:49.206 --> 01:15:52.009
Barber, isn't it?

1074
01:15:53.644 --> 01:15:56.180
You've some neck
for a shirt lifter.


1075
01:15:56.213 --> 01:15:58.649
Yeah, well, unlike
your sexual proclivities,


1076
01:15:58.682 --> 01:16:01.051
it isn't illegal, Minister.

1077
01:16:05.456 --> 01:16:07.257
I know O'Neill tipped you off

1078
01:16:07.291 --> 01:16:09.560
about Sara Dunne's
intention to go public.


1079
01:16:10.694 --> 01:16:15.399
I know you had Brendan West
pay off Eliza Farrell.


1080
01:16:15.432 --> 01:16:18.936
Was it that Sara Dunne
wasn't as compliant?


1081
01:16:18.969 --> 01:16:20.537
So you got rid of her?

1082
01:16:22.272 --> 01:16:26.076
You're making wild,
unsubstantiated allegations


1083
01:16:26.110 --> 01:16:28.145
against a serving Minister.

1084
01:16:30.013 --> 01:16:32.015
I could have you arrested.

1085
01:16:33.016 --> 01:16:36.220
There's a Garda
just outside the door.


1086
01:16:36.253 --> 01:16:38.522
Who do you think let me in?

1087
01:16:57.541 --> 01:16:59.643
Now you can ask me
everything you like


1088
01:16:59.676 --> 01:17:02.646
about that 24-carat prick.

1089
01:17:02.679 --> 01:17:04.481
I'm off duty tonight.

1090
01:17:05.416 --> 01:17:08.285
That sounds like something
a Guard would say.


1091
01:17:08.318 --> 01:17:11.021
I was a Guard, one time.

1092
01:17:13.157 --> 01:17:15.926
[sighs] You're not
an easy man to read.


1093
01:17:18.195 --> 01:17:20.964
<i>I think I'm going</i>
<i>to get to like you.</i>


1094
01:17:31.408 --> 01:17:34.411
[reflective music]

1095
01:17:54.799 --> 01:17:57.434
[Lexie] Looks so quiet.

1096
01:17:57.468 --> 01:17:59.703
[Barber] Looks can be deceptive.

1097
01:18:15.285 --> 01:18:18.322
I knew he was wrong.

1098
01:18:18.355 --> 01:18:21.191
O'Neill said you were,
you know...


1099
01:18:24.127 --> 01:18:25.696
I'm bisexual.

1100
01:18:27.564 --> 01:18:30.000
Sure, isn't everyone these days?

1101
01:18:48.552 --> 01:18:51.455
Never able to play by the rules,
were you, Barber?


1102
01:18:51.488 --> 01:18:54.491
Always have to do things
your own way.


1103
01:18:54.525 --> 01:18:56.426
Threatening a serving Minister?

1104
01:18:57.261 --> 01:18:59.363
You're in a world of pain now.

1105
01:18:59.831 --> 01:19:03.534
Now, I told you to keep your
nose out of police business.


1106
01:19:03.567 --> 01:19:07.371
And since when has covering for
perverts been police business?


1107
01:19:07.404 --> 01:19:08.539
Fuck!

1108
01:19:10.173 --> 01:19:12.175
I recorded everything on there.

1109
01:19:12.209 --> 01:19:14.611
The threats, the harassment,
phone tapping.


1110
01:19:14.645 --> 01:19:17.147
When this all comes out
your career is finished.


1111
01:19:17.581 --> 01:19:19.550
Times up, Inspector Quinn.

1112
01:19:21.285 --> 01:19:22.352
[spits]

1113
01:19:22.386 --> 01:19:25.155
[Barber breathing heavily]

1114
01:19:30.127 --> 01:19:31.328
Fuck!

1115
01:19:52.783 --> 01:19:55.118
You're looking a bit
the worse for wear.


1116
01:20:05.195 --> 01:20:07.799
-This proves nothing.
-It proves you know West.


1117
01:20:09.166 --> 01:20:12.804
And as we both know,
West works for Brady.


1118
01:20:16.640 --> 01:20:18.843
Do you genuinely think
that a sap like West


1119
01:20:18.876 --> 01:20:21.211
is gonna keep your and
Brady's dirty little secrets


1120
01:20:21.244 --> 01:20:23.246
when he's put
under a bit of pressure?


1121
01:20:23.280 --> 01:20:25.682
And as for your boy Quinn,
on top of the harassment


1122
01:20:25.716 --> 01:20:27.784
and illegal phone tapping
complaints I'm making,


1123
01:20:27.819 --> 01:20:30.687
I'm adding assault.

1124
01:20:30.721 --> 01:20:32.656
I've taped everything, so...

1125
01:20:32.689 --> 01:20:34.658
who knows what else
will come out in the wash?


1126
01:20:34.691 --> 01:20:37.427
You still don't know who
you're dealing with, do you?


1127
01:20:40.731 --> 01:20:42.399
Barber.

1128
01:20:43.567 --> 01:20:45.135
I'll make it worth your while.

1129
01:20:47.270 --> 01:20:49.272
She was a child.

1130
01:20:49.306 --> 01:20:51.408
You knew what Brady was like.

1131
01:20:51.441 --> 01:20:54.211
You still told him about
our plans to go public.


1132
01:20:54.244 --> 01:20:55.847
We all have our secrets,
Barber.


1133
01:21:01.518 --> 01:21:03.654
You don't frighten me, O'Neill.

1134
01:21:05.756 --> 01:21:08.258
I've had to deal with
bullies my whole life.


1135
01:21:09.359 --> 01:21:11.762
These aren't secrets.

1136
01:21:11.796 --> 01:21:13.330
They're crimes.

1137
01:21:13.363 --> 01:21:15.933
Just like domestic
violence is a crime.


1138
01:21:17.300 --> 01:21:18.769
Where is she?

1139
01:21:20.504 --> 01:21:22.305
Where the fuck is she?

1140
01:21:23.808 --> 01:21:27.544
I don't know
where the fuck she is.


1141
01:21:29.279 --> 01:21:31.715
It's your fault those
fucks went after her.


1142
01:21:33.885 --> 01:21:35.619
It's on you.

1143
01:21:46.630 --> 01:21:48.800
[Kate] Quick, quick,
turn on the telly!


1144
01:21:50.400 --> 01:21:56.206
<i>I've decided to waive</i>
<i>my anonymity and to speak out.</i>


1145
01:21:58.608 --> 01:22:01.411
<i>Minister Eunan Brady</i>

1146
01:22:01.445 --> 01:22:03.915
<i>performed a sex act</i>
<i>in front of me</i>


1147
01:22:05.382 --> 01:22:07.517
<i>when I was 15 years old.</i>

1148
01:22:08.853 --> 01:22:11.722
<i>I made a statement to</i>
<i>the Guards earlier today.</i>


1149
01:22:13.290 --> 01:22:17.028
<i>And I have decided</i>
<i>to speak up.</i>


1150
01:22:17.061 --> 01:22:21.465
<i>Because silence is what</i>
<i>allows men like Brady,</i>


1151
01:22:21.498 --> 01:22:24.001
<i>and those who cover up</i>
<i>his actions,</i>


1152
01:22:24.035 --> 01:22:27.704
<i>control women long after</i>
<i>the crime has been committed.</i>


1153
01:22:27.738 --> 01:22:29.773
<i>I couldn't have done</i>
<i>all of this</i>


1154
01:22:29.807 --> 01:22:32.275
<i>without the support</i>
<i>of my grandmother.</i>


1155
01:22:43.720 --> 01:22:45.522
[woman on radio] <i>Two more woman</i>
<i>have come forward</i>


1156
01:22:45.555 --> 01:22:47.758

1157

<i>against Minister Eunan Brady.</i>

1158

1160
01:22:54.832 --> 01:22:56.033
<i>A spokeswoman</i>
<i>for the department...</i>


1161
01:22:56.067 --> 01:22:57.969
Sara Dunne's gone viral.

1162
01:22:58.002 --> 01:22:59.669
What do you think happened?

1163
01:22:59.703 --> 01:23:02.506
Maybe I should hire
a private investigator.


1164
01:23:02.539 --> 01:23:04.341
-Oh!
-[he laughs]


1165
01:23:04.374 --> 01:23:06.010
Listen, I better
go to the office.


1166
01:23:06.043 --> 01:23:08.813
-Mmm. You be OK?
-Yeah, I'm grand.


1167
01:23:09.479 --> 01:23:11.883
Honestly, I have to start
getting on with my life
at some stage.


1168
01:23:12.749 --> 01:23:16.087
Actually, the therapist
suggested a support group.


1169
01:23:16.120 --> 01:23:18.089
So I think I might try that.

1170
01:23:18.122 --> 01:23:21.058
At least they'll know what
the fuck I'm talking about.


1171
01:23:21.092 --> 01:23:22.927
That does sound good.

1172
01:23:24.796 --> 01:23:26.831
-See you later.
-OK, see ya.


1173
01:23:36.874 --> 01:23:39.076
This is my granddaughter, Sara.

1174
01:23:43.047 --> 01:23:44.314
Yeah.

1175
01:23:45.983 --> 01:23:47.819
I saw you on the news.

1176
01:23:51.122 --> 01:23:52.756
So I was the patsy.

1177
01:23:54.658 --> 01:23:57.128
She was with you the whole
time I was looking for her?


1178
01:23:57.161 --> 01:23:58.762
I wouldn't call it that.

1179
01:23:58.796 --> 01:24:00.597
A belief that
you're hard to fool


1180
01:24:00.630 --> 01:24:03.767
is the one quality shared
by all suckers, Mrs. Dunne.


1181
01:24:06.469 --> 01:24:07.704
Why me?

1182
01:24:08.538 --> 01:24:12.009
I needed a detective
with good police contacts.


1183
01:24:13.010 --> 01:24:14.678
You could have told me.

1184
01:24:17.882 --> 01:24:20.918
These are powerful men.

1185
01:24:20.952 --> 01:24:23.753
I thought it was safer
to trust no one.


1186
01:24:25.422 --> 01:24:26.991
[Sara] I was scared.

1187
01:24:27.724 --> 01:24:29.961
There were people
following me and...


1188
01:24:29.994 --> 01:24:32.495
I was getting
these weird calls, so...


1189
01:24:33.730 --> 01:24:36.100
I went to Granny
and I told her everything.


1190
01:24:37.802 --> 01:24:39.536
And she believed me.

1191
01:24:41.638 --> 01:24:44.008
Without you, we wouldn't
have found Eliza Farrell.


1192
01:24:44.041 --> 01:24:46.043
So it was you following me?

1193
01:24:47.611 --> 01:24:49.579
There was no other way,
I'm afraid.


1194
01:24:50.147 --> 01:24:52.382
I knew there
must be more victims.


1195
01:24:53.117 --> 01:24:56.386
We just had no way of
finding that out ourselves.


1196
01:24:57.989 --> 01:25:00.423
[message alert]

1197
01:25:06.696 --> 01:25:08.966

Hi. Val Barber.

1201

Yeah, my rate's 50 an hour
plus expenses.


1202
01:25:50.573 --> 01:25:52.676
No, no, I'll come to you.

1203
01:25:52.709 --> 01:25:54.577
Yeah, text me your details.
