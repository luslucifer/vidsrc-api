And instead of it happening
just on any old weekday,

<i>So, his remaining years at</i>

<i>amidst an inexhaustible series</i>
<i>of pranks,</i>


890

<i>and an avalanche</i>
<i>of C's and D's.</i>

Sedgewick Hyram Bell.

892
01:06:02.235 --> 01:06:05.113
<i>And though his father's influence</i>
<i>guaranteed him a place at Yale,</i>


893
01:06:06.990 --> 01:06:09.326

<i>profound sense of failure,</i>


894
01:06:09.409 --> 01:06:12.829
<i>that in the spring of 1976,</i>

895
01:06:12.913 --> 01:06:17.584
<i>I handed</i>
<i>Sedgewick Bell his diploma.</i>

<i>[ Bell Tolling ]</i>

897
01:06:43.026 --> 01:06:45.362
<i>According to Heraclitus,</i>

<i>''an opportunity lost</i>
<i>is lost forever.''</i>


901
01:06:56.831 --> 01:07:01.252
<i>And yet, when Elizabeth's</i>
<i>marriage ended and she</i>
<i>returned home from England,</i>


902
01:07:01.336 --> 01:07:03.713
<i>the waters in which</i>
<i>we found ourselves swimming...</i>


903

<i>as those we had earlier only imagined.</i>


904
01:07:09.678 --> 01:07:12.097
<i>But if time had made</i>
<i>concessions for love,</i>


905

<i>it made none for death.</i>

906
01:07:14.683 --> 01:07:17.352
<i>And when our headmaster,</i>
<i>Terence Woodbridge, passed away,</i>


907
01:07:17.435 --> 01:07:19.979
<i>I felt profound sadness.</i>

908
01:07:20.063 --> 01:07:23.692
<i>Though the incident</i>

<i>had tested our friendship,</i>

<i>he had for half a century,...</i>

910
01:07:25.860 --> 01:07:30.865
<i>devoted himself</i>
<i>to St. Benedict's tradition of</i>
"academic and moral leadership"--


911
01:07:30.907 --> 01:07:33.910
<i>A tradition, I realized,</i>
<i>that was now mine...</i>

Good luck, Mr. Hundert.

914
01:07:57.726 --> 01:08:00.229
Thank you, Mr. Horner.

915
01:08:01.521 --> 01:08:04.149
Everyone.
Welcome.


916
01:08:04.232 --> 01:08:06.484
Larry, good to see you.

917
01:08:06.568 --> 01:08:10.572
Hi.
Mr. Phillips.


918
01:08:10.655 --> 01:08:12.782
Mr. Hundert.
Good to see you again.


919
01:08:12.866 --> 01:08:14.826
Uh, please take a seat.

920
01:08:14.910 --> 01:08:17.121
Uh--
Let's get right to it,
shall we?


921
01:08:17.203 --> 01:08:21.040
As you wish.

922
01:08:21.124 --> 01:08:24.753
Mr. Hundert, your contributions
at Saint Benedict's
have been extraordinary.


923
01:08:24.836 --> 01:08:28.256
Your tenure is unmatched,
and you are loved and revered by all.


924
01:08:28.298 --> 01:08:31.301
The notion of taking you away
from your classroom...


925
01:08:31.384 --> 01:08:33.678
is one to which
we've given great thought.


926
01:08:33.762 --> 01:08:36.098
A headmaster's job
is a rigorous one.


927
01:08:36.139 --> 01:08:39.309
The travel demands
and meeting schedules
have become unending.


928
01:08:39.392 --> 01:08:43.146
One must be prepared
to do battle 24 hours a day
and sometimes longer.


929
01:08:43.229 --> 01:08:46.524
<i>Well, having rowed our lake</i>
<i>every, day, weather permitting,</i>


930
01:08:46.608 --> 01:08:49.361
through the last seven
presidential administrations,


931
01:08:49.444 --> 01:08:51.947
I feel more than ready
to do battle.


932
01:08:56.034 --> 01:08:58.370
What we're saying,
Mr. Hundert, is--


933
01:09:00.830 --> 01:09:03.833
Mr. Hundert,
what experience do you have...


934
01:09:03.917 --> 01:09:07.504
with fund-raising
or building endowments?


935
01:09:07.587 --> 01:09:10.715
<i>Mr. Hundert, we can't afford</i>
<i>to lose you as a teacher here.</i>


936
01:09:10.799 --> 01:09:13.635
The reality is this.
Enrollment is down.


937
01:09:13.677 --> 01:09:16.638
People are thinking
of Saint Benedict's as old-fashioned.


938
01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:20.934
<i>We need to look</i>
<i>more to the future</i>
<i>and less to the past.</i>


939
01:09:26.064 --> 01:09:29.317
Then who?

940
01:09:30.568 --> 01:09:32.820
Someone from the outside?

941
01:09:32.862 --> 01:09:35.406
James Ellerby.

942
01:09:37.450 --> 01:09:39.369
Excuse me?

943
01:09:39.452 --> 01:09:42.246
You did realize he made
application for the job.


944
01:09:42.330 --> 01:09:44.791
<i>Mr. Ellerby has proposed</i>
<i>some very, exciting...</i>
No.

01:09:44.874 --> 01:09:48.336
"fund"-"raising possibilities."

946
01:09:51.548 --> 01:09:54.718
Miss Johnston, I've been
assistant headmaster for 17 years.


947
01:09:54.801 --> 01:09:56.845
I fail to see how Mr. Ellerby's...

948
01:09:56.928 --> 01:09:58.888
qualifiications as a fund-raiser--

949
01:09:58.930 --> 01:10:00.890
<i>It's not just</i>
"about fund"-"raising."


950
01:10:00.932 --> 01:10:04.436
James Ellerby is
a forward-thinking man.


951
01:10:04.519 --> 01:10:06.438
He's reached out
to the community.


952
01:10:06.521 --> 01:10:09.899
<i>He's built relationships to some</i>
<i>of the most important alumni.</i>


953
01:10:09.983 --> 01:10:12.444
<i>He is a wonderful communicator,</i>

954
01:10:12.527 --> 01:10:14.446
<i>with impeccable</i>
<i>moral standing...</i>


955
01:10:14.529 --> 01:10:17.741
<i>and an unwavering</i>
<i>commitment to this school.</i>


956
01:10:18.909 --> 01:10:20.869
So--

957
01:10:23.163 --> 01:10:25.540
Then you leave me no choice
but to tender my resignation.


958
01:10:25.582 --> 01:10:29.252
<i>I would ask you not to.</i>

959
01:10:29.336 --> 01:10:32.047
You are a teacher, and
the fiinest one we've ever had.


960
01:10:34.049 --> 01:10:35.968
Please excuse me.

961
01:10:36.051 --> 01:10:40.222
Please understand, Mr. Hundert,
you will be welcome back here
at Saint Benedict's at any time.


962
01:10:40.305 --> 01:10:43.141
"Th"-"The door"
<i>will forever be open.</i>


963
01:11:37.237 --> 01:11:39.156
I'm still shocked
at James Ellerby.


964
01:11:39.239 --> 01:11:43.827
Oh, I'm not.
I'm only shocked
that I didn't see it coming.


965
01:11:43.910 --> 01:11:47.956
I realize now he'd been
conducting a behind-the-scenes
campaign for years.


966
01:11:47.998 --> 01:11:53.170
He's godfather to two
of the board members' children,
for God's sake.


967
01:11:53.253 --> 01:11:55.338
[ Sighs ]

968
01:11:55.422 --> 01:11:57.883
I have...

969
01:11:57.966 --> 01:12:00.218
so many other things...

970
01:12:00.302 --> 01:12:02.679
that I've always
wanted to do.


971

I-I've always
wanted to write.


972
01:12:04.723 --> 01:12:08.227
I have an idea
for a book on the early days
of the Republic.


973
01:12:08.310 --> 01:12:10.938
Well,

974
01:12:11.021 --> 01:12:13.315
here's to Saint Benedict's.

975
01:12:27.704 --> 01:12:29.915
I brought you some tea.

01:12:29.998 --> 01:12:31.917
Mmm.

977
01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:33.877
Going well?

978
01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:36.588
Oh, it's virtually
writing itself.


979
01:12:36.671 --> 01:12:39.716
Good.
Then I won't interrupt you.

<i>Carry, on, then.</i>
<i>Good writing.</i>

<i>William?</i>

983
01:13:20.215 --> 01:13:22.926
James Ellerby's on the phone.

984
01:13:23.009 --> 01:13:27.931
The merger makes him C.E.O.
of one of the largest
corporations in America.


985
01:13:28.014 --> 01:13:31.935
But what does any of this
have to do with me?


986
01:13:32.018 --> 01:13:34.229
Here's the thing.
He's informed us
that he would like to make...


987
01:13:34.312 --> 01:13:36.689
a substantial donation
to Saint Benedict's...


988
01:13:36.773 --> 01:13:38.692
with one condition.

989
01:13:38.775 --> 01:13:42.237
He would like to hold
a rematch of the
Mr.Julius Caesar contest.


990
01:13:42.279 --> 01:13:44.490
A rematch?

991
01:13:44.572 --> 01:13:46.783
With you
as master of ceremonies.


992
01:13:46.866 --> 01:13:49.243
Why?

993
01:13:49.286 --> 01:13:51.246
He says he would like to
reclaim his intellectual honor.


994
01:13:51.288 --> 01:13:55.167
<i>And he says his secretary,'s</i>
<i>already located Louis Masoudi</i>
<i>and Deepak Mehta...</i>


995
01:13:55.250 --> 01:13:58.128
and doesn't really
anticipate too much trouble
tracking down the others.


996
01:13:58.169 --> 01:14:00.672
Didn't you tell him
I had retired?


997
01:14:00.755 --> 01:14:03.591
Well, he asked
for you and only you.


998
01:14:03.633 --> 01:14:06.136
He insisted on it
as a condition.


999
01:14:06.219 --> 01:14:12.100
And did Mr. Bell say how much
of a donation he was planning
to make to Saint Benedict's?


1000
01:14:12.142 --> 01:14:15.854
Enough for a 25,000-square-foot
addition to the library...


1001
01:14:15.937 --> 01:14:17.856
in honor
of his father.


1002
01:14:17.939 --> 01:14:20.859
It would be the school's
single largest donation to date.


1003
01:14:20.942 --> 01:14:26.656
And a retired history professor
with no fund-raising ability
is the linchpin.


1004
01:14:26.865 --> 01:14:29.534
Yes.

1005
01:14:29.618 --> 01:14:31.995
