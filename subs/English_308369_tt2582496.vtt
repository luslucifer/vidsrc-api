Well, you know,
I was talking to Denise...


159
00:07:43.357 --> 00:07:45.837
...and Denise feels that
you might be someone...


160

...who could make
Rachel feel better.


161

Yeah, but like I said,

we're not really friends, so...

163

want me to say?

She'll think
you're being sarcastic.

Are you telling me you can't do

for another person?

really what's happening here?

Fine. Okay.

Just, please don't
go through my stuff.

your stuff.

No, I was going in
for a fist bump.

in here.

Mmm-hmm.

313
00:14:28.997 --> 00:14:32.683
Seriously, like, how many...
how many pillows is that?


314

I don't know.

that many pillows.

a subhuman state.

was all about.

never did the subhuman thing.

so we had to go get some more...

786
00:35:31.917 --> 00:35:33.726
...from a restaurant,

787
00:35:33.797 --> 00:35:35.561
on the fifth floor
of an office building.


788
00:35:35.717 --> 00:35:37.003
And in the same building,

789
00:35:37.077 --> 00:35:38.317
there was a Jamaican embassy...

790
00:35:38.397 --> 00:35:40.798
...and we ended up
getting trapped


791
00:35:40.877 --> 00:35:42.437
in an elevator
with a Rastafarian guy...


792
00:35:42.557 --> 00:35:45.242
...and he just hotboxed
the whole elevator, so...


793
00:35:45.397 --> 00:35:47.718
We were stuck in there
for, like, 25 minutes...


794
00:35:47.877 --> 00:35:49.083
...and we had to breathe
the weird marijuana air.


795
00:35:49.237 --> 00:35:50.807
Earl, am I right?

796
00:35:50.957 --> 00:35:52.402
That's exactly what happened.

797
00:35:53.157 --> 00:35:55.558
You guys had
quite an adventure.


798
00:35:55.717 --> 00:35:58.243
(SIGHS) Being on drugs
just really sucks.


799
00:35:58.317 --> 00:35:59.807
Being around people
on drugs sucks.


800
00:35:59.997 --> 00:36:03.524

sorry, just sucks. I'm sorry.

is your problem, man?

'bout your sorry ass.

here to do. Okay?

'cause I love that shit.

Greg from class?


811

I've known Greg
ever since we were little.


812

You know, I was in
y'all kindergarten, right?

00:36:28.317 --> 00:36:29.842
Mmm-hmm. I remember you.

815
00:36:29.917 --> 00:36:31.919
You was the girl who called
Justin Jones perverted...


816
00:36:31.997 --> 00:36:34.364
...for showing girls
the birthmark on his butt.

(LAUGHS) Oh, my God, yes!

818
00:36:36.197 --> 00:36:37.881
Yeah, dude came running up,

819
00:36:37.997 --> 00:36:39.840
showed you his butt.
You were calm.


820
00:36:40.037 --> 00:36:42.608
Said, "Justin, only perverts
show their butts."

you remember that.

You a hero. Shut his
perverted ass right down.


824
00:36:49.277 --> 00:36:50.802
I never forget it.
(LAUGHS)


825
00:36:51.517 --> 00:36:53.645
So you and Greg are coworkers?

826
00:36:53.797 --> 00:36:54.878
Naw, we friends.

827
00:36:54.957 --> 00:36:57.437
He just hates calling people
his friend. Dude's got issues.


828
00:36:57.677 --> 00:37:00.044
RACHEL: Yeah, he does.
What's going on?


829
00:37:00.197 --> 00:37:02.723
EARL: Man, I don't even know.
It might be his folks.


830
00:37:02.877 --> 00:37:04.766
I mean, dude's mom
always tellin' him


831
00:37:04.837 --> 00:37:06.646
how handsome he is,
which he ain't.


832
00:37:06.797 --> 00:37:09.641
So now he think he can't trust
anybody close to him.


833
00:37:09.797 --> 00:37:10.923
Dude's weird-ass dad

834
00:37:10.997 --> 00:37:13.238
don't socialize with anybody
'cept the cat.


835
00:37:13.397 --> 00:37:15.798
So that's a role model
ain't got no friends.


836
00:37:16.197 --> 00:37:17.767
Bottom line, dude's terrified

837
00:37:17.837 --> 00:37:19.487
of callin' somebody
his friend...


838
00:37:19.637 --> 00:37:21.844
...and they sayin', "Hey, bro,
I'm not your friend."


839
00:37:22.037 --> 00:37:23.277
Then he'd have to kill himself.

840
00:37:23.557 --> 00:37:25.400
But how are you coworkers?

841
00:37:25.557 --> 00:37:28.208
We, um, we make films.

842

843
00:37:29.837 --> 00:37:32.681
Yeah. We been making them
for a few years now.


844
00:37:32.837 --> 00:37:34.885
We have, like, 42 in total.

Greg! You never told me.

846
00:37:36.997 --> 00:37:38.237
Well, we never told
anybody 'bout them.


847
00:37:38.317 --> 00:37:40.319
They suck.
I mean, they're terrible.


848
00:37:40.517 --> 00:37:42.326
I'm pretty sure they don't suck.

don't even worry about it.

I won't.

Earl and I got stoned somehow.

And it was after
we both ate your soup.

any marijuana,

<i>Just watching patiently
from the window</i>


1096
00:49:56.757 --> 00:50:00.921
<i>Just waiting
Seasons change someday</i>


1097
00:50:00.997 --> 00:50:02.886
<i>Oh, oh, my dreams will pull you</i>

1098
00:50:02.957 --> 00:50:04.402
<i>Through that garden gate</i>

1099
00:50:04.477 --> 00:50:09.643
<i>I want to be
the wandering sailor</i>


1100
00:50:12.157 --> 00:50:17.527
<i>We're silhouettes
by the light of the moon</i>


1101
00:50:19.757 --> 00:50:24.285
<i>I sit playing solitaire
by the window</i>


1102
00:50:27.597 --> 00:50:31.647
<i>Just waiting Seasons change, aha</i>

1103
00:50:31.757 --> 00:50:33.088
<i>You'll see, one day</i>

1104
00:50:33.157 --> 00:50:35.444
<i>These dreams will pull you
through my door</i>


1105
00:50:35.517 --> 00:50:39.966
<i>And I'll come running
to tie your shoe</i>


1106
00:50:43.477 --> 00:50:48.802
<i>I'll come running
to tie your shoe</i>


1107
00:50:51.157 --> 00:50:55.799
<i>I'll come running
to tie your shoe</i>


1108
00:50:58.957 --> 00:51:03.804
<i>I'll come running
to tie your shoe</i>


1109
00:51:32.997 --> 00:51:34.840
GREG: So,
if we make this film,


1110
00:51:34.917 --> 00:51:35.998
people are gonna be, like:

1111
00:51:36.357 --> 00:51:37.438
"Oh, Greg and Earl,

1112
00:51:37.517 --> 00:51:39.007
"they're those weird filmmakers.

1113
00:51:39.157 --> 00:51:40.841
"They're always
creepily filming stuff.


1114
00:51:40.997 --> 00:51:42.567
"They'll probably sneak into
your house one night


1115
00:51:42.677 --> 00:51:43.883
"and film you
while you're sleeping."


1116
00:51:43.997 --> 00:51:45.362
But people probably
already think that,


1117
00:51:45.437 --> 00:51:46.438
'cause you gave Rachel
those stupid films.


1118
00:51:46.517 --> 00:51:47.518
(MUFFLED)
This is nasty as hell.


1119
00:51:47.597 --> 00:51:49.281
GREG: So now, I've become
completely conspicuous,


1120
00:51:49.357 --> 00:51:50.518
like all the time.

1121
00:51:50.677 --> 00:51:51.883
People look at me and think,

1122
00:51:51.997 --> 00:51:53.123
"Filmmaker."
The hell even is this?


1123
00:51:53.237 --> 00:51:54.238
When they're not
already thinking,


1124
00:51:54.357 --> 00:51:55.397
"Cancer girl's boyfriend."

1125
00:51:55.437 --> 00:51:56.723
It tastes like a dog's
funky-ass butthole.


1126
00:51:56.837 --> 00:51:57.998
Furthermore,
we agreed to do a film


1127
00:51:58.077 --> 00:51:59.727
that we have no idea
what it should look like...


1128
00:51:59.877 --> 00:52:01.686
...or sound like, or even be.

1129
00:52:01.757 --> 00:52:02.963
I mean,
what the hell sort of film


1130
00:52:03.037 --> 00:52:05.119
should we even make? Huh?

1131
00:52:05.197 --> 00:52:07.006
I mean, what was I thinking?

1132
00:52:07.077 --> 00:52:08.203
EARL: You were thinking
that girl Madison


1133
00:52:08.277 --> 00:52:09.403
had nice titties.

1134
00:52:09.517 --> 00:52:10.757
I mean,
I like the titties too,


1135
00:52:10.877 --> 00:52:12.447
but now you got a problem.

1136
00:52:12.517 --> 00:52:14.121
'Cause I ain't agreed
to do this shit.


1137
00:52:14.197 --> 00:52:15.244
You did.

1138
00:52:16.757 --> 00:52:18.885
Are you not gonna
help me make this?


1139
00:52:18.957 --> 00:52:20.686
The hell we gonna make, son?

1140
00:52:20.757 --> 00:52:23.237
GREG'S DAD:
<i>They want fresh inspiration.</i>


1141
00:52:23.397 --> 00:52:24.957
I must tell you,
the richest inspiration


1142
00:52:25.037 --> 00:52:26.607
I have ever known was...

1143
00:52:26.757 --> 00:52:29.044
...during my period of
quarantine in the Amazon.


1144
00:52:29.117 --> 00:52:30.528
(THEME FROM THE CONVERSATION
PLAYING ON HEADPHONES)


1145
00:52:30.597 --> 00:52:32.281
Where I
and a half dozen other...


1146
00:52:32.397 --> 00:52:34.559
...unfortunates
had nothing to watch...


1147
00:52:34.717 --> 00:52:38.438
...but the bristling,
leviathan tarantula...


1148
00:52:38.597 --> 00:52:41.726
...bunched up on
the rotting, flimsy thatch...


1149
00:52:41.917 --> 00:52:43.919
...perhaps eight feet
above our faces.


1150
00:52:44.477 --> 00:52:47.242
Spiders the size of your fist.

1151
00:52:47.397 --> 00:52:49.923
Their fangs glistening
with venom and...


1152
00:52:50.077 --> 00:52:51.806
...their thousand-fold
black eyes


1153
00:52:51.917 --> 00:52:54.124
shining dully in the gloom.

1154
00:52:54.277 --> 00:52:55.563
In the darkness,
you would hear


1155
00:52:55.637 --> 00:52:57.082
the sudden anguished hiss...

1156
00:52:57.237 --> 00:53:00.320
...of a spider being struck
by an adult leopard wasp...


1157
00:53:00.517 --> 00:53:01.643
...and in their
mortal struggle,


1158
00:53:01.757 --> 00:53:03.077
they would plummet
to one's bed...


1159
00:53:03.157 --> 00:53:06.127
...biting and stinging
and thrashing...


1160
00:53:07.677 --> 00:53:09.839
You know that you can
smoke a hornet?


1161
00:53:11.077 --> 00:53:13.478
GREG: Okay, so just look at me
when you answer the questions.


1162
00:53:13.597 --> 00:53:15.838
Don't worry
about the camera, all right?


1163
00:53:16.917 --> 00:53:18.681
Okay, Denise.

1164
00:53:18.757 --> 00:53:20.600
Tell me a little
about Rachel's birth.


1165
00:53:21.517 --> 00:53:23.326
Uh, Rachel's birth.

1166
00:53:23.757 --> 00:53:25.361
What an ordeal that was.

1167
00:53:25.437 --> 00:53:26.438
(CHUCKLES)

1168
00:53:27.677 --> 00:53:30.601
Greg, just...
let me tell you one thing.


1169
00:53:31.677 --> 00:53:33.327
I was a really good mom
to her, you know?


1170
00:53:33.437 --> 00:53:34.962
I really was.

1171
00:53:35.157 --> 00:53:37.478
Some single moms,
their kids grow up too fast...


1172
00:53:37.637 --> 00:53:39.321
...but I always tried to
protect Rachel from that.


1173
00:53:39.477 --> 00:53:42.003
I did my very best
to protect her from...


1174
00:53:43.717 --> 00:53:45.640
...growing up too quickly,
you know?


1175
00:53:47.397 --> 00:53:48.478
Right.

1176
00:53:48.557 --> 00:53:50.798
And now, I'm learning
that there are...


1177
00:53:52.557 --> 00:53:53.638
...there are just
some things that you can't


1178
00:53:53.717 --> 00:53:55.765
protect your kid from,
you know?


1179
00:53:57.317 --> 00:53:59.558
No matter what you do,
you just...


1180
00:54:06.117 --> 00:54:08.802
So, did she have
any favorite toys?


1181
00:54:09.317 --> 00:54:11.479
Before I answer that question,
this is serious...


1182
00:54:13.277 --> 00:54:15.928
...so use your ears
and listen to me.


1183
00:54:16.997 --> 00:54:18.408
I want you
to promise me something


1184
00:54:18.477 --> 00:54:19.808
as I care about you.

1185
00:54:19.957 --> 00:54:21.686
You gotta promise me you're
not gonna have a baby...


1186
00:54:21.797 --> 00:54:22.764
...unless you're
ready to love


1187
00:54:22.837 --> 00:54:24.277
that baby's mother
your whole life...


1188
00:54:24.317 --> 00:54:25.318
...and this is serious.

1189
00:54:25.477 --> 00:54:28.799
I'm telling you something
that nobody's gonna tell you.


1190
00:54:28.957 --> 00:54:32.279
Don't pick a girl
who's push-pull, you know?


1191
00:54:32.357 --> 00:54:35.088
You wanna pick somebody
who's gonna love you...


1192
00:54:35.757 --> 00:54:37.998
...and not forget you,
and not...


1193
00:54:38.197 --> 00:54:41.326
...leave you for someone
with a big, fat ass.


1194
00:54:41.917 --> 00:54:43.840
So, no favorite toy.

1195
00:54:44.437 --> 00:54:45.438
DENISE: Um...

1196
00:54:46.117 --> 00:54:48.438
Oh, you want to know what?
Here's a favorite toy.


1197
00:54:48.517 --> 00:54:49.518
Scissors.

1198
00:54:49.677 --> 00:54:51.520
When Rachel's father
first left...


1199
00:54:51.677 --> 00:54:53.202
...she gathered up
all his books,


1200
00:54:53.277 --> 00:54:54.278
favorite old books...

1201
00:54:54.357 --> 00:54:57.042
...and she rounded 'em up
and she cut them right up.


1202
00:54:57.157 --> 00:54:58.283
Please, don't tell her
I'm telling you,


1203
00:54:58.357 --> 00:54:59.722
she would chop my head off.

1204
00:54:59.877 --> 00:55:02.562
But she just...
(IMITATES SCISSORS)


1205
00:55:02.637 --> 00:55:04.366
And I was, like,
"Atta girl."


1206
00:55:04.557 --> 00:55:07.720
Snip, snip, snip.
She was very mad.


1207
00:55:07.877 --> 00:55:10.118
Can we take a little break
and have a little taste?


1208
00:55:10.197 --> 00:55:11.722
You boys are old enough
to have a little taste, right?


1209
00:55:11.837 --> 00:55:14.408
Can we take a teeny break,
just have a little taste?


1210
00:55:15.957 --> 00:55:18.563
Oh, yeah, that's a good boy.

1211
00:55:18.717 --> 00:55:21.402
Greg, will you join us?

1212
00:55:21.517 --> 00:55:23.007
Oh, I'm okay.

1213
00:55:23.077 --> 00:55:25.557
Oh, come on,
don't be a party pooper!


1214
00:55:25.637 --> 00:55:27.002
All right, all right.

1215
00:55:28.357 --> 00:55:30.883
Now we can get back
to our interview.


1216
00:55:31.677 --> 00:55:32.917
GREG: So, basically,
this whole setup


1217
00:55:32.997 --> 00:55:34.123
is so that, you know...

1218
00:55:34.197 --> 00:55:36.006
...I can talk to you,
you can talk to me...


1219
00:55:36.077 --> 00:55:38.318
...and I can see you,
and you can see me.


1220
00:55:38.477 --> 00:55:39.763
Except it's not really me,
it's a phone.


1221
00:55:39.917 --> 00:55:41.760
And I know that
sounds kind of weird,


1222
00:55:41.837 --> 00:55:43.168
but it's not.

1223
00:55:43.397 --> 00:55:46.321
So, anyway, just treat it
like a get-well card,


1224
00:55:46.437 --> 00:55:47.882
you can look into the lens.

1225
00:55:48.037 --> 00:55:49.448
And, uh...

1226
00:55:49.597 --> 00:55:51.361
Yeah, it's a video,
so you know...


1227
00:55:51.517 --> 00:55:52.598
...don't think about it
too hard,


1228
00:55:52.717 --> 00:55:54.367
but just make it good.

1229
00:55:54.517 --> 00:55:55.928
Start whenever you're ready.

1230
00:55:56.077 --> 00:55:57.283
STUDENT: Hi, Rachel.

1231
00:55:57.437 --> 00:55:59.838
I guess I don't really
know you that well...


1232
00:55:59.997 --> 00:56:02.204
...but I believe in you.
You can do it.


1233
00:56:02.357 --> 00:56:03.927
That's real nice, yo.

1234
00:56:04.117 --> 00:56:06.040
It's so sweet
that your boyfriend


1235
00:56:06.117 --> 00:56:07.607
is doing this for you.

1236
00:56:07.757 --> 00:56:09.088
He must really love you.

1237
00:56:09.237 --> 00:56:11.285
EARL: Girl, that ain't
her boyfriend.


1238
00:56:11.397 --> 00:56:12.398
Oh.

1239
00:56:12.557 --> 00:56:14.798
<i>I know you're Jewish,
but I just wanted you to know</i>


1240
00:56:14.917 --> 00:56:16.726
<i>that God has a plan for you.</i>

1241
00:56:16.877 --> 00:56:18.038
<i>You seem like
a really cool person.</i>


1242
00:56:18.117 --> 00:56:19.448
<i>I know we don't really talk.</i>

1243
00:56:19.637 --> 00:56:22.641
<i>But you've got
a lot of friends. And, uh...</i>


1244
00:56:22.797 --> 00:56:23.798
<i>Out of all the people
in this school,</i>


1245
00:56:23.877 --> 00:56:25.447
<i>I don't hate you.</i>

1246
00:56:26.037 --> 00:56:28.278

1403
01:05:40.997 --> 01:05:42.761
Get outta here, Greg.
You've done your time.


1404
01:05:42.837 --> 01:05:45.118
You don't have to hang
around with the sick girl anymore.


1405
01:05:49.517 --> 01:05:51.519
How can you even
say that to me?


1406
01:05:52.597 --> 01:05:55.168
Your mom forced you
to hang out with me.


1407
01:05:55.317 --> 01:05:56.887
Earl forced you
to show me your movies.


1408
01:05:56.997 --> 01:05:59.125
Madison forced you
to make a movie about me.


1409
01:05:59.197 --> 01:06:01.882
So, what part of this
did you actually want to do?

(SNIFFLES)

1411
01:06:21.517 --> 01:06:24.168
Just... Just do something
nice for me for once


1412
01:06:24.237 --> 01:06:26.046
and just get out.

1413
01:06:51.597 --> 01:06:52.758
GREG: <i>Earl!</i>

1414
01:06:53.077 --> 01:06:55.444
This is it!
You've gone too far!


1415
01:06:55.597 --> 01:06:56.837
You've leaked
the unleakable secret


1416
01:06:56.917 --> 01:06:58.442
because you hold
nothing sacred.


1417
01:06:58.557 --> 01:06:59.604
'Cause you're a dickhead!

1418
01:06:59.717 --> 01:07:00.764
The foundation of any

1419
01:07:00.877 --> 01:07:02.481
good working partnership
is trust...


1420
01:07:02.557 --> 01:07:04.366
...and I can no longer
trust you in any way.


1421
01:07:04.437 --> 01:07:05.677
You'll leak anything to anyone.

1422
01:07:05.757 --> 01:07:07.361
It's like working
with Julian Assange.


1423

Damn it!

The hell you want?

1425
01:07:24.877 --> 01:07:26.800
Just waiting for Earl.
Awright, awright.


1426
01:07:27.517 --> 01:07:29.042
Whassup, boy?
You gonna come in?


1427
01:07:29.197 --> 01:07:31.279
So, Rachel told me that
you told her about the, uh...


1428
01:07:31.637 --> 01:07:33.207
...about the film
that we're making for her.


1429
01:07:33.277 --> 01:07:34.278
Yeah?

1430
01:07:34.917 --> 01:07:36.885
You're like Julian Assange, man.

1431
01:07:37.037 --> 01:07:38.402
It's like you
always do this...


1432
01:07:38.477 --> 01:07:39.677
I don't know,
'cause you, like,


1433
01:07:39.717 --> 01:07:41.321
wanna be a better friend
than me or something?


1434
01:07:41.397 --> 01:07:42.558
I don't know if I can
work with you again


1435
01:07:42.637 --> 01:07:43.843
after you sell me out
like a dick!


1436
01:07:43.917 --> 01:07:46.238
Oh, okay. Watch out, yo.

1437
01:07:47.157 --> 01:07:49.159
Hey, yo,
shut your ass up, man!


1438
01:07:49.237 --> 01:07:50.807
Like you care so much about
what other people think,


1439
01:07:50.917 --> 01:07:52.078
boy, you go around here...

1440
01:07:52.157 --> 01:07:53.238
...kissin' everybody ass,

1441
01:07:53.317 --> 01:07:54.398
pretending like
they your friend.


1442
01:07:54.477 --> 01:07:56.798
Look, nobody
gives a shit about you, Greg!


1443
01:07:56.957 --> 01:07:58.083
All right? Nobody give a shit!

1444
01:07:58.157 --> 01:07:59.158
DERRICK: Whoop his ass!

1445
01:07:59.277 --> 01:08:01.723
And then the one girl
who do actually care about you...


1446
01:08:01.837 --> 01:08:02.918
...you wanna come
over here and


1447
01:08:02.997 --> 01:08:05.477
bitch and whine
about some films, yo? Huh?


1448
01:08:05.597 --> 01:08:07.998
Because somebody
actually cares about you?


1449
01:08:08.077 --> 01:08:09.408
Like, damn,
I'm so tired of you


1450
01:08:09.477 --> 01:08:11.161
treating this girl
like she a burden.


1451
01:08:11.277 --> 01:08:13.245
You know,
her life is over after this!


1452
01:08:13.317 --> 01:08:14.477
And you want to
come over here


1453
01:08:14.517 --> 01:08:17.248
bitchin' and whinin' about
some irrelevant bullshit!


1454
01:08:17.317 --> 01:08:19.763
Like, yo, you so close to me
knocking your shit loose right now, son!


1455
01:08:19.837 --> 01:08:20.918
Go for it!

1456
01:08:20.997 --> 01:08:22.078
Oh, so you want me
to hit you now? Huh?


1457
01:08:22.157 --> 01:08:24.080
Yeah, I don't care!
You want me to hit you now?


1458
01:08:24.157 --> 01:08:25.517
Yeah, Earl, I want you to!

See, Greg?

You lucky that was him
and not me out there...


1463
01:08:36.957 --> 01:08:39.119
...'cause I'd have been whooping
your ass up and down this street.


1464
01:08:39.197 --> 01:08:41.397
It'd have been a ass-whoopin'
fest around here, you dig?

01:08:54.877 --> 01:08:58.040
Uh, I need another extension.

1468
01:08:58.197 --> 01:09:00.438
That might prove difficult...
(EXHALES)

Yeah, I've just been busy.

1472
01:09:10.597 --> 01:09:12.440
You know, I heard...

1473
01:09:15.837 --> 01:09:17.327
...about Rachel.

1474
01:09:18.397 --> 01:09:20.001
How you holding up?

1475
01:09:24.197 --> 01:09:25.198
You know...

1476
01:09:26.477 --> 01:09:28.002
...not great.

1477
01:09:33.317 --> 01:09:36.719
You know, my dad died
when I was 15, Greg.


1478
01:09:37.077 --> 01:09:39.079
A couple years younger than you.

1479
01:09:39.517 --> 01:09:42.760
You know, the thing is that,
when I was a kid...


1480
01:09:43.397 --> 01:09:46.082
...I really,
I really can only remember


1481
01:09:46.157 --> 01:09:48.000
thinking about him as this...

1482
01:09:48.077 --> 01:09:51.479
...you know, big,
kind of like asshole guy.


1483
01:09:52.957 --> 01:09:55.198
At his wake,
these buddies of his


1484
01:09:55.277 --> 01:09:56.324
kept coming up to me...

1485
01:09:56.397 --> 01:09:59.082
...and telling me
these stories about him.


1486
01:09:59.277 --> 01:10:01.405
And it was like
they were talking about


1487
01:10:01.477 --> 01:10:03.320
some complete other guy.

1488
01:10:04.717 --> 01:10:06.526
To give you an example.

1489
01:10:07.197 --> 01:10:10.406
He knew every single
European pop song


1490
01:10:10.477 --> 01:10:11.808
from the 1970s.

1491
01:10:11.957 --> 01:10:12.958
Every single one.

1492
01:10:14.037 --> 01:10:15.277
He'd memorize these songs,

1493
01:10:15.357 --> 01:10:17.200
and he'd do that
so he could go...


1494
01:10:17.357 --> 01:10:20.247
...and sing them
to German girls in bars.


1495
01:10:21.277 --> 01:10:22.563
He had a go-to,

1496
01:10:22.637 --> 01:10:25.163
his number one
go-to song. It was a...


1497
01:10:26.157 --> 01:10:30.367
It was a Dutch song.
It was called <i>Ding-a-Dong.</i>


1498
01:10:32.037 --> 01:10:35.678
My dad used to sing that
to German girls in bars.


1499
01:10:36.877 --> 01:10:38.561
That's a fact.

1500
01:10:42.157 --> 01:10:43.966
So what does that mean?

1501
01:10:46.397 --> 01:10:49.321
Well, Greg, I think that
it just means that...


1502
01:10:50.357 --> 01:10:52.837
...even after somebody dies,
you can...


1503
01:10:53.717 --> 01:10:56.038
...you can still
keep learning about them.


1504
01:10:57.077 --> 01:10:59.808
You know, their life.

1505
01:11:01.557 --> 01:11:04.800
It can keep unfolding
itself to you just as long...


1506
01:11:05.757 --> 01:11:08.283
...just as long as
you pay attention to it.


1507
01:11:09.517 --> 01:11:10.848
Are you seriously
trying to turn this


1508
01:11:10.917 --> 01:11:13.238
into some stupid sappy lesson?

No! Look, I'm going home.

doing literally
no school work this year!
