12
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.600
帕尔瓦娜
Parvana.


13
00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.670
我们家能拿得出手来卖的只有这件了
It's the only thing of value we have left.


14
00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.610
我都没穿过 一次都没有
I never wore it. Not even once.


15
00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.040
在我们国家 你哪有机会穿这裙子呢？ 帕尔瓦娜
Where would you wear it, Parvana?


16
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.750
- 还是继续学习吧 好不好？ - 好吧 爸爸
- Let's continue your studies. All right? - Yes, Baba.


17
00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.880
那好 关于丝绸之路 你了解多少？
Now, what can you tell me about the Silk Road?


18
00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.620
丝绸之路
The Silk Road.


19
00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.390
爸爸 我记不起丝绸之路的相关知识了
Baba, I can't remember about the Silk Road.


20
00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.990
或许我们可以把这当成一个故事来记
Maybe if we think of it like a story.


21
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.760
即使我们一无所有 故事也总能记在心间
Stories remain in our hearts even when all else is gone.


22
00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:46.600
自我们的文明伊始 我们的人民就开始讲故事了
Our people have always told stories, from our very beginning,


23
00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.840
那时我们的家乡叫作帕提亚和霍拉桑
when we were Parthia and Khorasan.


24
00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.510
我们的家园在兴都库什山脉的利爪下被分成数个部分
A fractured land in the claws of the Hindu Kush mountains,


25
00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.710
有北部沙漠那炽烈之眼的灼热
scorched by the fiery eyes of the Northern Deserts,


26
00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.750
亦包括那黑白交汇的冰峰之凛冽
black rubble earth against ice peaks.


27
00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.790
我们的家园就如一个凶兽的骨架
Our land was the petrified skeleton of a monster.


28
00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.520
我们的家园叫阿里亚纳
We were Ariana,


29
00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.000
是高尚与荣耀之乡
the land of the noble and honorable.


30
00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.200
我们可谓是世界交通的枢纽
We were a pathway to everywhere,


31
00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.870
让东西方可互通有无
carrying goods from east to west.


32
00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:21.740
我们研究星象
We studied the stars


33
00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.940
在混乱的星空中寻找规律
and began to see order amidst the chaos.


34
00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.010
我们的人民中涌现许多科学家 哲学家和故事传唱人
We were scientists, philosophers, and storytellers.


35
00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.680
为解答疑惑而探求真知
Questions sought answers and then more questions.


36
00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.180
我们开始了解宇宙中我们的位置
We began to see our place in the universe.


37
00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.890
但我们处于两个交战国的边境交汇处
But we were at the edges of empires at war with each other,


38
00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:42.720
数千年以来
as borders were defined and redefined...


39
00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.700
边境无数次被重新界定
over thousands of years.


40
00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.800
无数统治者在此开战 有波斯的居鲁士二世大帝
Of these mighty rulers came Cyrus the Great of Persia.


41
00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.610
还有马其顿王国的亚历山大大帝
Then Alexander the Great of Macedon.


42
00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.940
有印度的孔雀王朝
There came the Mauryan Empire,


43
00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.880
也有成吉思汗的铁骑
Genghis Khan,


44
00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.250
还有好多好多
and so on and so on.


45
00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.810
每次战争都血流成河
Each time there was bloodshed,


46
00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.020
而每次战争也都会有幸存者
and each time there were survivors.


47
00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.620
历史的轨迹不断地重复着
A pattern repeating itself endlessly.


48
00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:16.960
帕尔瓦娜 我年轻的时候
When I was young, Parvana,


49
00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:20.960
在这个城市里 我体验过和平的滋味
I knew what peace felt like, here in this city.


50
00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:25.130
孩子们都会去读书 女人们也能上大学
Children went to school, women went to university.


51
00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.940
这里成了世外桃源
All the empires forgot about us,


52
00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:29.140
至少有那么一段时间是
for a while at least.


53
00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.740
但好景不长
But it did not last.


54
00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.610
我们的国土变得脆弱不堪
The ground became weak under our feet,


55
00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.950
从未安定
always uncertain.


56
00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:41.180
先是一场政变 又来了一次入侵
First came a coup d'état, then an invasion,


57
00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:42.890
之后就是内战
then a civil war.


58
00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:45.620
如此的混乱局面下
In the chaos,


59
00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.760
有些人希望领袖可以恢复秩序
some looked to those who might restore order.


60
00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:51.790
但那代价实在是太大了
But at a great cost.


61
00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:55.160
我们给女性定下了严格的德行规范
We have determined specific dignity for women!


62
00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.270
女人决不能外出 招惹不必要的关注
Women should not go outside and attract unnecessary attention!


63
00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:03.800
如果女人向外人展露自己的容貌 她将受到伊斯兰教法的诅咒
If a woman shows herself, she will be cursed by the Islamic Sharia


64
00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.210
永远也别想上天堂
and should never expect to go to heaven.


65
00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.780
一切都变了 帕尔瓦娜
Everything changes, Parvana.


66
00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.880
记录这些的故事提醒着我们
Stories remind us of that.


67
00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:17.920
帕尔瓦娜 你到底有没有在听啊？
Parvana, were you listening at all?


68
00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.190
我在听呢 爸爸
Yes, Baba.


69
00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:23.060
要不你给我讲讲我们游牧民族的祖先
Why don't you tell me about our nomadic ancestors


70
00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.600
和他们那些金山的事 好不好？
and their hills of gold?


71
00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:27.960
好吧
Well?


72
00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.730
2000年前

73
00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:33.800
- 然后呢？ - 2000年前...
- Yes? - 2,000 years ago...


74
00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:37.940
有一位巴克特里亚王国公主
there was a Bactrian princess


75
00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:40.380
她有一个王冠
who had a crown.


76
00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:42.340
然后呢？
And?


77
00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:44.210
- 然后...- 帕尔瓦娜？
- And... - Parvana?


78
00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:46.680
走开 别碰我的东西
Away. Keep away from my things.


79
00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.950
快走 我说快走 你这只蠢狗
Go away. I said go away, you silly dog!


80
00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:52.890
嘿 你 你以为你在干什么？
Hey, you! What do you think you're doing?


81
00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:54.150
这个女孩为什么乱喊？
Why is this girl shouting?


82
00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.390
她只是个孩子 她无意引人注目
She is only a child. She meant nothing by it.


83
00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:58.160
她就是在引人注意
She's drawing attention to herself!


84
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.730
她应该待在家里 而不是在市场抛头露面
She should be at home, not displaying herself in the market.


85
00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:04.070
我家除了一个婴儿 没有男孩 我需要她帮我
I have no son at home, except an infant. I need my daughter to help me.


86
00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:05.730
- 站起来 我们跟你说话呢 - 我是个残..
- Stand up when we talk to you. - I am a cr...


87
00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:07.040
我说给我站起来
I said stand up!


88
00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:15.910
- 我认得你 - 是的 伊德瑞斯
- I know you. - Yes, Idrees.


89
00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:18.150
我以前给你上过课 你那时是个好学生
I was your teacher once. You were a good student.


90
00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:21.050
你给我讲那堆没用的东西 浪费了我宝贵的时间
You wasted my time, teaching me things of no worth.


91
00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:24.690
我已加入塔利班 现在是专杀伊斯兰敌人的战士
I have joined the Taliban and now I fight the enemies of Islam.


92
00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:29.260
好吧 如果我也能算是敌人 那真主已经夺走了我的腿来惩罚我的罪
Well, if I am an enemy, then for my sins God has taken my leg.


93
00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.130
老头 你敢嘲笑我？
Are you making fun of me, old man?


94
00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:34.760
我在战争中失去了一条腿 那场我们并肩作战的战争
I lost my leg in the war. The war we fought together.


95
00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:36.930
- 她多大了？- 伊德瑞斯
- How old is the girl? - Idrees.


96
00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:38.900
- 她还是个孩子 - 她这岁数已经能嫁人了
- She is a child. - She's old enough to marry.


97
00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:40.730
我也快要讨老婆了
I'll be looking for a wife soon.


98
00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:42.740
她已经许配给别人了
She's already been promised to someone.


99
00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:44.440
她得把自己裹好
Well, she should cover herself properly.


100
00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:46.840
- 或许你该把眼睛从她身上拿开 - 你跟我说什么？
- Maybe you should stop looking at her. - What did you say to me?


101
00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:49.010
我说你把你那双眼睛拿开
I said stop looking at her.


102
00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:50.880
- 我杀了你 - 伊德瑞斯
- I can have you killed! - Idrees.


103
00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:53.080
- 注意你的言辞 - 够了 走吧
- You watch what you say! - That's enough. Come on.


104
00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:57.420
你还好吗？
Are you all right?


105
00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:59.250
我没事 爸爸
Yes, Baba.


106
00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:00.790
不愧是我的好女儿
That's my girl.


107
00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:02.890
我们回家吧
Let's go home now.


108
00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:20.010
帕尔瓦娜？
Parvana?


109
00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:24.280
你跟那男的说我已经许配给别人了
You told that boy I was promised to someone.


110
00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:26.110
我是要结婚了吗？
Am I getting married?


111
00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:28.920
当然不是 你还是个孩子呢
Of course not. You are still a child.


112
00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:31.320
我现在只想让你天天玩耍 讲讲故事就好
I want you playing and telling stories.


113
00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:33.190
我长大了 不愿意讲什么故事了
I'm too old for that now.


114
00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:36.290
长大了就不爱故事了？ 你一直很爱故事啊
Too old for stories? You've always loved stories.


115
00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:38.230
讲故事能有什么用？
What's the use?


116
00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:53.040
我跟你妈妈谈几句 一切都会好起来的
I'll have a word with Mama-jan and we'll sort it all out.


117
00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:54.780
求你别提那裙子的事
Please don't mention the dress.


118
00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:02.950
要不她会唠叨个没完的
Then I'll never hear the end of it.


119
00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:05.290
- 什么没完？ - 没事 妈妈
- The end of what? - Nothing, Mama-jan.


120
00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:07.920
我们不卖帕尔瓦娜的漂亮裙子了
We're not selling Parvana's good dress.


121
00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:10.420
爸爸 我说的不是这个
Baba, that's not what I meant.


122
00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:12.490
我们需要钱 孩子她爸
We need the money, Baba.


123
00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:16.300
这几天市场比较萧条 过一阵就好了
We'll hold off for a bit. I think business will pick up.


124
00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:19.370
如果经济好起来 我们当然不用卖这裙子
If business picks up, then we won't have to sell it, sure.


125
00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:23.170
但是理想很遥远 现实很骨感 我们必须卖掉它
But the sky is far and the earth is hard. We will have to sell it soon.


126
00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:25.240
好吧 那饭前讲个故事如何？
Well, what about a little story before dinner?


127
00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:28.840
这样暂时我们都不会因裙子的事而烦心了
And we'll forget all about dresses for a while.


128
00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:31.410
或许帕尔瓦娜想给我们讲个故事？
Maybe Parvana would like to read something for us?


129
00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:34.120
现在我不想讲 妈妈 我好累
Not right now, Mama-jan. I'm tired.


130
00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:36.990
她跟我说她已经长大了
She's not a child anymore, she tells me.


131
00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:39.250
所以她现在不喜欢故事了
So she doesn't like stories.


132
00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:42.860
别急着当大人 宝贝女儿
Don't be in such a hurry to grow up, my sweet girl.


133
00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:45.230
长大并没你想的那么好
It might not be all that you expect.


134
00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:48.500
我们家没水了 今早你带回来的水不够
We're out of water. You didn't bring enough this morning.


135
00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:50.430
门边不是有半桶水嘛
But there's half a bucket by the door.


136
00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:54.540
我在你这岁数的时候 家里从来没缺过水
When I was young enough to fetch water, the buckets were never empty.


137
00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:56.400
- 嘿 - 你们俩别闹了
- Hey! - Girls, stop it.


138
00:08:56.410 --> 00:08:59.470
如果你不去井里打水的话
Either you go out and get more water after dinner...


139
00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:01.980
你就得给扎西换尿布
or you can wash Zaki's dirty diapers.


140
00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:04.510
你今天怎么样？ - 好多了
- How are you feeling? - Better.


141
00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:05.980
有你在我就好多了
Now that you're here.


142
00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:11.120
要不是你总洗头 也许水不会这么快就用光呢
Maybe if you didn't wash your hair so much, we wouldn't run out so quickly.


143
00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:14.050
- 帕尔瓦娜 - 要尊重你姐姐
- Parvana. - You should have some respect.


144
00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:16.860
你们怎么不吃呢？
Why don't you eat, hmm?


145
00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:21.100
- 吃饱了一切才会好起来 - 好的
- Things always look better when your belly is full. - Yes, Maudar.


146
00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:34.440
扎西 扎西 等我先把你袖子卷好
Zaki, Zaki, wait till I pull up your sleeves.


147
00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:36.040
不要嘛 妈妈
No, Mama-jan.


148
00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:39.050
这样就好啦
There. There you go.


149
00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:43.180
别把葡萄干都吃了 帕尔瓦娜 那是留给扎西的
Don't eat all the raisins, Parvana. Leave them for Zaki.


150
00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:46.520
你怎么不把你下巴上的那粒大葡萄干给扎西呢 苏拉娅？
Why don't you give him that big raisin on your chin, Soraya?


151
00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:48.890
哦 不对 那不是葡萄干
Oh, but it's not a raisin.


152
00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:50.990
是个长毛的大痣
It's a big, hairy mole.


153
00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:54.400
帕尔瓦娜 向苏拉娅道歉
Parvana, apologize to Soraya.


154
00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:59.840
帕尔瓦娜？
Parvana?


155
00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:08.210
他就在里面 我看他进去的
He's in there! I saw him!


156
00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:09.980
- 如果家里有女人... - 爸爸？
- If there are women present... - Baba?


157
00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:11.850
把自己裹好
Cover yourselves now!


158
00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:16.180
就这个人 他是伊斯兰的敌人
That's the man. An enemy of Islam.


159
00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:19.450
他有禁书 还教女人读禁书
He's got forbidden books, and he's teaching the women with them!


160
00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:21.360
- 放过我们吧 - 他什么也没干
- Leave us be! - He's done nothing!


161
00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:26.260
拿孺拉·阿利在 跟我们走一趟吧
Nurullah Alizai, you must come with us.


162
00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:27.630
爸爸
Baba!


163
00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:30.200
- 你们不能带他走 - 爸爸
- You can't take him! - Baba!


164
00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:32.330
爸爸
Baba-jan!


165
00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:36.270
你们要带他去哪？
Where is he being taken?


166
00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:38.270
去监狱
To prison.


167
00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:41.180
普利查西监狱的人会好好教育他的
They'll teach him a good lesson in Pul-e-Charkhi.


168
00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:44.280
爸爸
Baba!


169
00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:45.950
爸爸
Baba!


170
00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:11.540
妈妈？ 我能开灯吗？
Mama-jan? Can I light the lamp?


171
00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:14.980
嘘 帕尔瓦娜 你会吵醒扎西的
Hush, Parvana. You'll wake Zaki.


172
00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:16.940
可如果他们放过了爸爸
But if they let Baba go,


173
00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:19.710
他需要灯光才能看到家在哪
he'll need a light in the window to see home.


174
00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:23.250
他怎么可能还回得来？他连他的拐杖都没来得及带走
How could he come home? He doesn't even have his stick to walk with.


175
00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:28.420
快睡觉吧 都会好起来的
Go back to sleep. It will be all right.


176
00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:31.430
你怎么知道的 妈妈？你怎么知道？
How do you know that, Mama-jan? How do you know?


177
00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:35.100
别说了 帕尔瓦娜 妈妈已经够愁的了
Be quiet, Parvana. She has enough to worry about.


178
00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:48.440
嘿 扎西 别拽了
Hey! Zaki, stop it.


179
00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:52.050
起床了 帕尔瓦娜 别闹了
Get up, Parvana. Stop playing around.


180
00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:53.610
为什么？怎么回事？
Why? What's going on?


181
00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:55.280
你跟我去找你爸爸
You and I are going to find Baba.


182
00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:59.190
那个男孩说你爸爸在普利查西监狱 我们今天就去那
The boy said he was being taken to Pul-e-Charkhi prison, so that's where we are going.


183
00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:01.090
但是没有爸爸 我们不能出门
But we can't go outside without Baba.


184
00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:03.190
苏拉娅正在写一封给监狱长的信
Soraya is writing a letter for the prison governor


185
00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:05.560
信中对拿孺拉被捕事件提出抗议并请求立即释放你爸爸
to protest Nurullah's arrest and ask for his release.


186
00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:08.530
至少我能把信给他们 - 妈妈 这是不允许的
- At least I can give them that. - Mama-jan, it's not allowed.


187
00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:11.730
如果不引人注意的话 我们不会有问题的
We might be all right if we don't draw attention to ourselves.


188
00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:13.530
- 但我们不能... - 行了 帕尔瓦娜
- But we can't... - Come on, Parvana.


189
00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:16.340
带上你爸爸的拐杖 准备出发
And bring Baba's walking stick. We have to get going.


190
00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:28.080
妈妈
Mama.


191
00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:50.300
嘿
Hey.


192
00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:52.240
嘿 你
Hey, you!


193
00:12:54.610 --> 00:12:57.410
问安 你能告诉我普利查西监狱是哪个方向吗？
Salaam. Can you tell me the way to Pul-e-Charkhi?


194
00:12:57.410 --> 00:13:01.720
问安 过河后向东走
Salaam. Uh, it's east, past the river.


195
00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:04.220
- 但是路很远 - 谢谢您
- But it's a long way. - Thank you, sir.


196
00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:07.460
听好 你们得从老城穿过去 要不你们会被抓的
Listen. Go through the old town, or you'll be caught.


197
00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:31.250
为什么你们独自在外？
Why are you out here by yourself?


198
00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:33.180
- 你丈夫呢？ - 我没办法啊
- Where is your husband? - I have no choice.


199
00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:36.120
没有成年男性伴随 女人禁止独自出门
It's not permitted to be out here without your husband or your brother.


200
00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:38.150
- 对不起 我知道的 - 你懂吗？
- I'm sorry. I know. - Do you understand?


201
00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:41.220
我带着这封抗议我丈夫的抓捕行为的信...- 别废话 快回家
- I am bringing a letter protesting my husband's arrest... - Just go home.


202
00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:42.720
- 不行 - “不行”是什么意思？
- No! - What do you mean, "no"?


203
00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:44.460
这是我的丈夫 拿孺拉·阿利在
This is Nurullah Alizai, my husband.


204
00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:47.160
- 他在无指控前提下昨晚被捕 - 禁止留照片
- He was arrested last night with no charges laid against him. - Photographs are forbidden!


205
00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:50.600
- 我家里只剩女人了... - 你想干什么？ 又是给我看照片...
- I have no one at home... - What are you doing, showing me a photograph?


206
00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:54.100
- 又是在外抛头露面的 快滚回家 - 我家里只有女人和孩子
- Out here by yourself. Go home! - There is no one in my house except for children.


207
00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:58.510
你不能在外面闲逛 你懂吗？立即回家
You have no business out here. Do you understand? Go home. Immediately.


208
00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:01.610
你这是自找麻烦
You're looking for trouble now!


209
00:14:10.690 --> 00:14:13.320
你是你丈夫和民族的耻辱
You are an insult to your husband, to your race!


210
00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:15.460
我得知道他现在状况如何
I need to find out what happened to him!


211
00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:19.130
闭嘴
Shut up!


212
00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:36.510
去监狱也没什么用
Going to the prison will change nothing.


213
00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:39.310
如果你去监狱惹麻烦
If you make trouble like this,


214
00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:43.180
你丈夫会因你的无礼行为而受重罚的
your husband will be punished severely for your insolence.


215
00:14:43.190 --> 00:14:47.120
如果你再看到你在外不回家的话 我会把你抓起来的
And if I find you out here again by yourself, I will arrest you.


216
00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:49.360
现在回家
Now go.


217
00:14:55.530 --> 00:14:57.400
妈妈？
Mama-jan?


218
00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:59.370
带我回家
Take me home.


219
00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:07.500
- 还要 - 嘘
- More! - Shh.


220
00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:10.300
去打水 帕尔瓦娜 家里没水了
Go get water, Parvana. We have none left.


221
00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:12.680
快去
Come on.


222
00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:44.270
滚出去
Get out!


223
00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:47.610
你想干什么？
What are you up to?


224
00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:50.610
快离开这 他们会看到你的
Get out of here. They'll see you!


225
00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:53.310
嘿 站住
Hey, stop!


226
00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:55.690
听见没 我让你站住
Stop when I tell you!


227
00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:02.590
来这边
Through here!


228
00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:06.330
站住
Stop!


229
00:17:06.330 --> 00:17:07.930
那男孩往哪跑了？
Where did that boy go?


230
00:17:07.930 --> 00:17:09.630
你看到了吗？看到他了吗？
Did you see? Did you see?


231
00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:13.500
- 嘿 那个女孩你别跑 - 嘿
- Hey, you! Girl! - Hey!


232
00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:15.640
- 别跑 - 别管那个女孩了
- Come on! - Forget about her!


233
00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:23.010
帕尔瓦娜 你只打回来半桶水
Parvana, this is only half a bucket.


234
00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:24.880
你不能打满一桶水再回来吗？
Couldn't you fill them up all the way?


235
00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:28.550
扎西 嘘 别吵醒妈妈
Zaki, shh. Don't wake her.


236
00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:31.850
- 嘘 扎西 - 妈妈
- Hush, Zaki. - Mama-jan!


237
00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:33.790
- 嘘 - 哄他安静下来 帕尔瓦娜
- Shh. - Sooth him, Parvana.


238
00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:35.460
妈妈
Mama-jan.


239
00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:36.990
给他讲个故事
Tell him a story.


240
00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:38.630
妈妈...
Mama...


241
00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:41.360
很久很久以前
One time in the distant past,


242
00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:44.960
在兴都库什山脚下有个小村庄
there was a little village at the foot of the Hindu Kush mountains.


243
00:17:44.970 --> 00:17:47.870
- 我想要妈妈 - 嘘 好好听故事
- I want Mama-jan. - Shh. Listen.


244
00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:52.340
村民刚得到许多珍贵的种子
The villagers had just managed to gather precious seeds.


245
00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:56.740
为此 他们载歌载舞 开怀大吃
And so, there was dancing and singing and laughing and eating.


246
00:17:56.750 --> 00:17:58.950
每个人都洋溢着欢乐的笑容
Everyone was happy.


247
00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:00.950
尤其是一个男孩
Especially for one boy


248
00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:04.980
歌 舞 笑 吃 属他最欢
who danced and sang and laughed and ate more than anyone else.


249
00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:24.770
正当村民载歌载舞 开怀大吃的时候
While the villagers were dancing and singing and laughing and eating,


250
00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:25.910
怪物来袭了
monsters were coming.


251
00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:36.690
怪物们吓跑了驴子 啃食了树木
The monsters frightened the donkeys and ate the trees.


252
00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:43.920
他们偷走了全村最宝贵的东西...
They stole the most precious thing in the whole village...


253
00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:47.400
明年用来耕种的种子
the seeds for next year's crop.


254
00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:54.670
然后怪物们跑回其主人栖息的兴都库什山脉...
Then they ran back to the Hindu Kush mountains where their master lay...


255
00:18:54.670 --> 00:18:58.540
它就是可怕的象王 有着像尖刺一样的象牙
the dreadful Elephant King with spikes for tusks.


256
00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:01.910
嗷儿！
Grrrroar!


257
00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:05.580
嗷儿！嗷儿！

求你快吃吧 妈妈 吃饱了才会好受些
Please eat, Mama-jan. You'll feel better when your belly is full.


261
00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:06.470
我们家快断粮了
There's hardly any food left.


262
00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:08.680
那我去集市

268
00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:38.000
但是 先生 求你了 能卖给我6个苹果吗？
But, sir, can I please have six apples?


269
00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:41.770
- 让你的爸爸来买吧   - 我爸爸被带走了
- Get your father to buy food for you. - My father has been taken.


270
00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:43.980
对不起 要不你晚点再来买吧
I'm sorry. Maybe come back later.


271
00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:09.840

Stop when I tell you!


277
00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:35.500
回去 回家去
Go! Go home!


278
00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:39.830
我把包弄丢了
I dropped the bag.


279
00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:41.600
- 嘘  - 我把钱给丢了

281
00:21:43.810 --> 00:21:45.880
现在先别担心这些

282
00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:48.910
我给你留了一块馕饼
I saved you a piece of naan.


283
00:21:48.910 --> 00:21:52.550
我给你热一下 就会又好吃又新鲜 好不好？
I'll heat it up for you so it's nice and fresh. All right?


284
00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:16.800
- 我们该怎么办？ - 我也不知道
- What are we going to do? - I don't know.


285
00:22:16.810 --> 00:22:20.040
也许明早我早点出去 在市场人多起来之前买吃的回来
Maybe if I go out early, before it's crowded.


286
00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:21.810
没用的 帕尔瓦娜
It won't work, Parvana.


287
00:22:21.810 --> 00:22:25.350
市场里的人不会冒险东西卖给你的
Market sellers won't risk getting in trouble for serving you.


288
00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:27.950
妈妈的表兄住在马扎里沙里夫
Mama-jan has cousins in Mazar-e-Sharif.


289
00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:30.050
我可以写信请他们帮帮忙
I could write to them for help.


290
00:22:30.050 --> 00:22:34.620
但是我们跟他们连面都没见过 你怎么知道他们会帮忙呢？
But we've never even met them. How do you know they will help?


291
00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:36.090
我们现在就需要食物啊
We need food now.


292
00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:23.830
这些是你哥哥的旧衣服
These were your brother's clothes.


293
00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:27.040
它们很大 但是穿的时候向上提一提就好
They will be big, but we can take them up a bit.


294
00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:31.270
我看起来像男孩吗？
Do I look like a boy?


295
00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:34.010
你看起来像苏莱曼
You look like Sulayman.


296
00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:36.210
- 太像了 - 妈妈
- So much like him. - Mama-jan.


297
00:24:36.210 --> 00:24:38.810
他是个好男孩
He was such a good boy.


298
00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:42.080
他那会儿也不比你现在大多少
Not much older than you are now.


299
00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:43.190
嘘
Shh.


300
00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:46.420
没事的 妈妈
It's all right, Mama-jan.


301
00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:49.960
帕尔瓦娜要去集市买食物 还要打水
Parvana is going to the market for food and water.


302
00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:52.960
只有这个办法了 妈妈 我们什么都没有了
It's the only way, Mama-Jan. We have nothing left.


303
00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:16.520
但是这些果汁是温的 我才不要温的果汁
But these juices are warm. I don't want warm juice.


304
00:25:43.010 --> 00:25:46.110
是的 我就是那么说的 但是你知道的...
Yes, that's what I said, but you know...


305
00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:48.410
问安 向您问安
Salaam. Salaam!


306
00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:50.220
打扰下 问安
Excuse me. Salaam!


307
00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:52.950
问安 问安  进来吧 小伙子
Salaam! Salaam! Come inside, boy!


308
00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:56.130
我又不送货 是吧！
I'm not going to deliver, am I?


309
00:25:58.290 --> 00:26:01.100
就是这么回事 你知道了吧？
But you know how it goes, right?


310
00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:05.370
说吧 你要买什么
Well, let's hear it.


311
00:26:05.370 --> 00:26:10.240
我要买一公斤大米 半公斤小扁豆 和一小点葡萄干
I need a kilo of rice, a half kilo of lentils, and a small amount of raisins.


312
00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:13.110
一小点
A small amount?


313
00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:15.470
卖你多少按我的想象来？
Should I go by my imagination?


314
00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:17.180
是的
Yes.


315
00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:20.110
这孩子 不是很灵光啊
Not very bright, this one.


316
00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:24.450
烂铁也造不出利剑啊
Poor iron won't make a sharp sword.


317
00:26:24.450 --> 00:26:27.020
看看他的傻笑
Look at him smiling!


318
00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:30.520
这孩子都不知道我们在取笑他什么
Little guy doesn't even know when he's being made fun of.


319
00:26:30.530 --> 00:26:33.060
谢谢您 非常感谢
Thank you. Thank you very, very much.


320

茶都洒出来了
You're spilling the tea.


321
00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:57.890
对不起 叔叔
Sorry, Uncle.


322
00:27:05.230 --> 00:27:07.460
你是谁？ 你为什么盯着我看？
Who are you? Why were you staring at me?


323
00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:08.960
- 你叫什么名字？ - 我的名字？

324
00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:11.330
- 我在哪见过你的   - 不是... 我不是...
- I know you from somewhere. - No... I wasn't...


325
00:27:11.330 --> 00:27:14.430
- 不是什么？  - 你不可能认识我
- Wasn't what? - You don't know me.


326
00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:16.240
- 我认识你的  - 不可能！
- I do know you. - No!


327
00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:19.010
- 我真认识你 你是帕尔瓦娜   - 我不是
- I do know you! You're Parvana! - I'm not!


328
00:27:19.010 --> 00:27:21.410
我是什沃吉亚 记得吗？ 学校里那个？
I am Shauzia! Remember? From school?


329
00:27:22.910 --> 00:27:26.110
- 什沃吉亚？ - 我之前是留长头发的 话说那会儿你也是
- Shauzia? - I had long hair then, but so did you.


330
00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:28.320
- 德利瓦  - 别跟别人说
- Deliwar. - Don't tell anyone.


331
00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:29.850
给你帽子
Here's your cap.


332
00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:32.920
你需要一个男孩的名字
You need to get a boy's name


333
00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:35.490
这样下次别人再问你的时候 你就不会犹豫了
so you don't hesitate next time somebody asks you.


334
00:27:35.490 --> 00:27:37.360
我现在叫德利瓦
I am Deliwar now.


335
00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:38.990
名字的意思是“勇敢”

336
00:27:38.990 --> 00:27:41.360
- 你在哪呢？ - 我 我得走了

338
00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:47.000
德利瓦
Deliwar.


339
00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:49.670
妈妈 请坐下吧
Mama-jan, please sit down.


340
00:27:49.670 --> 00:27:54.240
- 马上要到宵禁了 如果到时候她还没有回来呢？ - 她没事的 我...
- It will be curfew soon. What if she's not back by then? - She's fine. I'm...


341
00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:55.580
谁肚子饿了？
Who's hungry?


342
00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:58.150
帕尔瓦娜
Parvana.


343
00:27:58.150 --> 00:28:00.380
感谢真主安拉 他把你给我带回来了
Praise Allah. He has returned you to me.


344
00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:03.950
妈妈 你把馕饼都挤扁了
Mama-jan, you're squashing the naan.


345
00:28:03.950 --> 00:28:06.020
闻起来太香了 帕尔瓦娜
It smells delicious, Parvana.


346
00:28:13.330 --> 00:28:15.030
扎西
Zaki.


347
00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:21.370
是我啊 认出来了么？
It's me. See?


348
00:28:23.210 --> 00:28:26.040
我特别为你买的
I bought them especially for you.


349
00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:32.010
帕尔瓦娜？
Parvana?


350
00:28:32.010 --> 00:28:34.110
如果你现在就跑出去打水
If you run out and get some water,


351
00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:36.320
等你回来时 他就会习惯你的新样子了
he'll get used to you by the time you come back.


352
00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:38.480
- 但是我已经累了 - 快点 帕尔瓦娜
- But I'm tired. - Hurry on, Parvana.


353
00:28:38.490 --> 00:28:40.190
马上就要宵禁了
It's almost curfew.


354
00:29:08.050 --> 00:29:10.290
你看着太像他了
You look so much like him.


355
00:29:11.150 --> 00:29:12.690
去把苏莱曼的衣服换下来吧
Go change Sulayman's clothes,


356
00:29:12.690 --> 00:29:14.490
要不该弄脏了
or you'll get them dirty.


357
00:29:14.490 --> 00:29:16.290
已经脏了
They are already dirty.


358
00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:26.470
大象
Elephant.


359
00:29:26.470 --> 00:29:28.340
什么？
What?


360
00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:31.640
他想让你继续讲大象的故事
He wants you to continue your story about the elephant.


361
00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:33.640
大象
Elephant.


362
00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:35.380
好吧 嗯...
Well, um...


363
00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:37.610
在村子里
in the village,


364
00:29:37.610 --> 00:29:40.050
在兴都库什山脉脚下
under the Hindu Kush mountains,


365
00:29:40.050 --> 00:29:42.590
可怜的村民们都失声痛哭
the poor villagers cried bitter tears.


366
00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:49.390
没有了珍贵的种子 他们变得惊慌失措
They did not know what they would do without their precious bag of seeds.


367
00:29:49.390 --> 00:29:52.160
明年春天没有了种子可以去播种
They would have nothing to sow come next spring


368
00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:54.430
到了冬天也没有可以吃的食物
and nothing to eat come next winter.


369
00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:58.260
但是那个男孩 他并没有哭
But the boy, he did not cry bitter tears.


370
00:29:58.270 --> 00:30:00.470
他看向山峦 然后大喊...
He looked toward the mountain and he shouted...


371
00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:02.740
我才不害怕你呢
I am not afraid of you,


372
00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:06.440
又大又扎人的坏象王！
big, spiky, bad Elephant King!


373
00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:16.180
也许有一点点害怕
Well, maybe he was a little bit afraid.


374
00:30:16.190 --> 00:30:19.750
他告诉村里这些以苦泪洗面的人
He told the villagers who had been weeping bitter tears


375
00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:23.290
在春天之前 他就能把种子拿回来
that he would get the bag of seed back before spring.


376
00:30:23.290 --> 00:30:26.160
在春天到来之前 我就能把种子拿回来
I will get the bag of seed back before spring.


377
00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:28.660
但是他们都嘲笑了他
But they laughed.


378
00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:32.800
他们大笑不止 因他只是个孩子 并不是一位伟大的勇士
They laughed and laughed, because he was a child and not a great warrior.


379
00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:35.570
但是男孩又一次发了誓
Yet the boy repeated his promise.


380
00:30:35.570 --> 00:30:39.570
我说了 我会在春天之前把那一袋种子拿回来
I said, I will get the bag of seed back before spring.


381
00:30:39.570 --> 00:30:41.340
接着他离开了村庄
And he left the village


382
00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:43.710
向着象王的怒吼勇敢前进
to the sound of the Elephant King's roars ahead of him.


383
00:30:45.650 --> 00:30:47.520
吼！
Roar!


384
00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:20.210
妈妈 既然现在我扮成男孩了
Mama-jan, now that I am a boy


385
00:31:20.210 --> 00:31:23.220
我们就可以去监狱找爸爸了
we can go to the prison and find Baba.


386
00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:25.750
不 帕尔瓦娜 我们不能这么做
No, Parvana, we can't do that.


387
00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:27.250
- 为什么不行？ - 嘘 安静
- Why not? - Shh.


388
00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:29.720
没你想得那么简单 帕尔瓦娜
It's not that simple, Parvana.


389
00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:31.590
但我们总得试一试啊
But we have to try.


390
00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:34.190
- 我们什么也做不了  - 才不是
- There's nothing we can do. - That's not true.


391
00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:36.670
别说了 帕尔瓦娜 别惹她伤心了
Stop it, Parvana. You're upsetting her.


392
00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:49.710
嘿 嘿 我叫你站住 你怎么还跑？
Hey! Hey! I told you to stop! Why do you keep running?


393
00:31:49.710 --> 00:31:51.780
别人叫你站住的时候 你就应该乖乖听话
You should have stopped when you were told to.


394
00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:55.380
你的布卡袍呢 你为什么如此打扮就出门
Where's your burqa? Why are you dressed like this outside your house?


395
00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:58.890
我丈夫把我的布卡袍拿走了 我得去买药
My husband took my burqa. I needed to buy medicine.


396
00:31:58.890 --> 00:32:00.650
住嘴
Stop it. Stop it.


397
00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:03.760
他居然允许你出门不穿布卡袍 他该受到惩罚
He should be punished for letting you outside like this!


398
00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:06.460
- 拜托 别这样 - 你必须得替他受罚
- Please, please! Please! - You have to take his punishment!


399
00:32:10.730 --> 00:32:13.400
乖乖待在里面吧 那才是属于你的地方
Stay inside where you belong!


400
00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:33.660
德利瓦 德利瓦
Deliwar. Deliwar!


401
00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:37.990
你想好叫什么了吗？
Well? Have you remembered your name yet?


402
00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:40.790
我想我没法继续扮男孩了
I don't think I can go on like this.


403
00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:42.730
太可惜了 我还指望你帮帮我呢
Too bad. I could use some help.


404
00:32:47.770 --> 00:32:50.840
- 我看到了些事 - 你指望我能说什么？
- I saw something. - What do you want me to say?


405
00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:52.340
我本该帮忙的
I should have helped.


406
00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:55.880
- 你能做的也就是给自己招来几次鞭打了 - 但我不是男孩
- You'd have helped yourself to a good whipping, that's all. - But I'm not a boy.


407
00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:57.810
你不是男孩 也不是女孩
You're not a boy, you're not a girl.


408
00:32:57.810 --> 00:33:01.620
我需要帮助 托盘太重了 你能帮我下吗？
I need a helper because this tray is too heavy. Will you help?


409
00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:05.790
快挠挠我鼻子 如果我松手皮带会断的
Scratch my nose. Quickly. If I let go of the tray, the strap will break.


410
00:33:05.790 --> 00:33:07.350
好多了
That's better.


411
00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:08.920
- 奥狄什 - 你说什么？
- Aatish. - What?


412
00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:11.690
我想好我的名字了 就叫奥狄什
I remembered my name. It's Aatish.


413
00:33:11.690 --> 00:33:14.030
- 那可算不上是个名字 - 它的意思是“火”
- That's not really a name. - It means "fire."


414
00:33:14.030 --> 00:33:17.760
我知道它的意思 不代表这词算是个名字
I know what it means, but it's still not a name.


415
00:33:17.770 --> 00:33:19.870
可它跟我挺配的
Then it suits me fine.


416
00:33:19.870 --> 00:33:21.470
那我就叫你奥狄什好了
I'll call you Aatish then.


417
00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:25.670
如果你是个男孩 你想去哪里都行
When you're a boy you can go anywhere you like,


418
00:33:25.670 --> 00:33:27.480
奥狄什汗
Aatish Khan.


419
00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:37.620
我们要去哪？
Where are we going?


420
00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:39.360
等着瞧吧
You'll see.


421
00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:56.940
如果有人看到我们怎么办？
What if someone sees us?


422
00:33:56.940 --> 00:33:59.410
我一般都假装说我在这工作
I usually just pretend I work here.


423
00:33:59.410 --> 00:34:01.640
假话说道你自己都信了 那别人也会信
If you look like you believe it, then they will too.


424
00:34:02.910 --> 00:34:04.810
看到没 我们就是清洁工
See? We're cleaners.


425
00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:39.050
你还在等什么呢？
What are you waiting for?


426
00:34:39.050 --> 00:34:41.450
我们不拿走的话 就白白便宜给老鼠了
It's either ours, or the mice eat it.


427
00:34:41.450 --> 00:34:43.850
我得想个办法去找我爸爸
I need to find a way to see my Baba.


428
00:34:43.850 --> 00:34:46.650
喜欢的话 把我爸给你都行 反正我不想要他这样的爸爸
You can have mine if you like. I don't want him.


429
00:34:46.650 --> 00:34:50.490
自从我爸入狱后 我们就再也没听到过他的消息了
My father was taken to prison and we've heard nothing of him since.


430
00:34:50.490 --> 00:34:53.060
- 他们是不会让你见他的 帕尔瓦娜 - 但是我现在是个男孩了
- They won't let you see him, Parvana. - But I'm a boy now.


431
00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:56.800
没什么区别 无论他们是继续关着你爸爸还是放了他 你都帮不上什么忙的
Doesn't make a difference. They'll keep him or let him go, but there's nothing you can do.


432
00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:59.000
这可说不准
You don't know that.


433
00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:02.470
抱歉 但事实就是这样
I'm sorry. It's just the way it is.


434
00:35:04.910 --> 00:35:09.740
也许有办法 但是得花上很多钱
There might be a way, but you'll need lots of money.


435
00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:11.680
钱能有什么用？
What for?


436
00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:14.880
靠贿赂能办成很多事 很多很多
You can get a lot done with bribes. A lot.

What happened to the man who used to sit here?


443
00:35:37.010 --> 00:35:39.070
这问题很好答吧
It is a simple question.


444
00:35:39.070 --> 00:35:40.910
你难道不知道吗？
Don't you know?


445
00:35:40.910 --> 00:35:43.840
我怎么会知道？回答问题 他在哪？
How should I know? Answer the question. Where is he?


446
00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:47.010
- 他去马扎里沙里夫了 - 那你又是他的什么人？
- He left for Mazar-e-Sharif. - And what are you to him?

00:35:55.460 --> 00:35:59.490
- 你有什么要我读的？我会普什图语和达利语 - 读读这个
- Do you have something to read? I read Pashto and Dari. - Read this.


450
00:36:02.730 --> 00:36:04.770
让我见识下你的水平
Let's see if you're any good.

Come on. Take it out of the envelope.


452

“亲爱的拉扎克……”
"Dear Razaq..."


453
00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:20.780
大声点 不然我去叫别人读了
Louder, or I will have to take my business elsewhere.


454
00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:24.180
“亲爱的拉扎克 我希望在喀布尔的你能收到这封信
"Dear Razaq, I hope this letter reaches you in Kabul.


455
00:36:24.190 --> 00:36:27.190
我写信给你 是想告知你一个不好的消息
I'm writing to you with sad news.


456
00:36:27.190 --> 00:36:32.430
很遗憾地告诉你 哈拉·贝格姆在去她妹妹婚礼的路上去世了
I am sorry to tell you that Hala Begum died on the way to her sister's wedding.


457
00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:37.100
她坐的那辆巴士碰到了地雷
The bus she was traveling on hit a land mine.


458
00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:39.530
她受了重伤 难以救治
Her injuries were too great to bear


459
00:36:39.530 --> 00:36:41.900
几小时之后便去世了
and she died some hours afterward.


460
00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:44.540
我知道这对你来说必定是天大的打击
I know this must be a great shock to you,


461
00:36:44.540 --> 00:36:46.870
但我要跟你说 在我最后一次和哈拉的谈话中
but please know that when I last spoke to Hala,


462
00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:49.580
她告诉我说你对她真的很好
she told me of your kindness toward her.


463
00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:53.180
愿真主安拉保佑你
May Allah bless you now,

00:36:53.180 --> 00:36:55.820
指引你道路 给予你勇气”
guide your path, and give you courage."


465
00:36:59.150 --> 00:37:00.920
节哀顺变
I'm sorry.


466
00:37:33.550 --> 00:37:36.560
我亲爱的宝贝
Ah, there's my sweet little girl


467
00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:38.260
脸上全是喀布尔的灰尘
underneath all the dust of Kabul.


468
00:37:39.990 --> 00:37:42.590
帕尔瓦娜 你给扎西什么了？
Parvana, what did you give Zaki?


469
00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:44.860
- 1块糖 - 1整块？
- It's a piece of candy. - A piece?


470
00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:47.070
喔
Oh!


471
00:37:47.070 --> 00:37:49.540
太大了 他噎着了
It's big enough to choke him!


472
00:37:49.540 --> 00:37:52.270
他没事的 苏拉娅 你坏他兴子呢
Let him be, Soraya. You're spoiling his fun.


473
00:37:53.970 --> 00:37:55.280
嗷
Ow!


474
00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:58.180
继续讲吧 帕尔瓦娜
Continue the story, Parvana.


475
00:37:58.180 --> 00:38:00.310
讲给扎西听
For Zaki.


476
00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:02.750
很久很久以前 有一位年轻的小男孩
There was this young boy,


477
00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:07.320
他向村民发誓 要去找到那袋珍贵的种子
and he promised his people to find the precious seeds.


478
00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:09.560
那大象呢 大象呢？
Elephant? Elephant?


479
00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:12.660
对 还有那头大象
Yes, and the elephant.


480
00:38:12.660 --> 00:38:15.930
晚上 男孩漫步穿过松林
At night, the boy walked through the pine trees


481
00:38:15.930 --> 00:38:18.970
准备去山里跟象王对峙
on his way to the mountain to face the Elephant King.


482
00:38:25.910 --> 00:38:28.780
在黑暗中 有个东西在跟着他
Something was following him in the darkness,


483
00:38:28.780 --> 00:38:31.780
但他太害怕了 不敢回头看看到底是什么
but he was too terrified to turn around and face it.


484
00:38:33.150 --> 00:38:34.780
于是他开始跑
He began to run,


485
00:38:34.780 --> 00:38:36.990
跟着他的那东西也开始跑
and the thing that chased him also ran.


486
00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:42.930
男孩跑得越快 那东西追得更紧
The boy ran faster and so did his pursuer.


487
00:38:44.130 --> 00:38:45.760
他就在黑夜里奔跑
He ran into the night,


488
00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:49.600
未知的魔鬼追逐着他 直到他再也没有力气继续跑
chased by the unknown demons until he could run no more.


489
00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:52.070
他从山坡上摔了下去
He tumbled down a hill.


490
00:38:52.070 --> 00:38:54.000
一直向下摔
Down.


491
00:38:55.140 --> 00:38:57.200
向下摔
Down.


492
00:38:57.210 --> 00:38:58.810
向下
Down.


493
00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:18.260
亲爱的表兄 我们已很多年没有联系了
Dear Cousin, it has been many years since we have spoken,


494
00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:23.160
我写这封信是想告诉你 我丈夫被抓了
but I am writing to you now to tell you that my husband has been arrested


495
00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:27.140
他何时会被释放 能否被释放 我们都不得而知
and we have no word on when he will be released, if at all.


496
00:39:28.970 --> 00:39:32.740
我们一家都很绝望 我急需你的帮助
My family is in a desperate situation and I need your help.


497
00:39:33.710 --> 00:39:35.680
我家长女已到了可以嫁人的年龄了
My eldest daughter is now of age,


498
00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:40.620
我希望你能考虑让她嫁给你最年幼的儿子阿杰玛
and I am asking that you consider her as a bride for your youngest son, Ajmal.


499
00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:44.780
请把我们带出喀布尔
Please take us out of Kabul


500
00:39:44.790 --> 00:39:47.990
这样我们才有生存下去机会
so that we may have a chance of survival.


501
00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:50.390
我们不会成为负担的
We will not be a burden to you.


502
00:39:50.390 --> 00:39:52.290
我们有生活技艺 也很坚强
We are skilled and strong


503
00:39:52.290 --> 00:39:55.060
你在我们身上也不会有太多的花销
and need little by the way of means.


504
00:39:55.060 --> 00:39:59.000
愿真主安拉保佑你 费特马
May the blessings of Allah be upon you. Fattema.

1500吧

517
00:40:32.170 --> 00:40:33.900
看这裙子卟呤卟呤的 多闪啊
See how it sparkles?


518
00:40:35.270 --> 00:40:37.770
我给你1000
Here's 1,000.


519
00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:48.910
- 你挣了多少钱？ 1000
- How much did you make? - A thousand.


520
00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:51.480
这钱差不多够贿赂一次了
That might be enough for a good bribe.


521
00:40:51.490 --> 00:40:53.720
- 真的？ - 当然了
- Really? - Definitely.


522
00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:57.460
我也在攒钱 只要是能从我爸那瞒下来的钱 我都会存起来
I'm saving up too. Whatever money I can hide from my father, I keep.


523
00:40:57.460 --> 00:41:00.660
慢慢积少成多
And it's mounting up to a nice little sum.


524
00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:03.060
看见了吗？
See?


525
00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:05.830
你知道的 我可不想一直都呆在这
I'm not going to stay here forever, you know.


526
00:41:05.830 --> 00:41:08.800
- 你见过海吗？ - 没有
- Have you ever been to the sea? - No.


527
00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:10.000
我也是
Neither have I.


528
00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:14.410
但是我听说过月亮会把海水都牵引到海岸上
But I've heard that the moon pulls the water onto the shore


529
00:41:14.410 --> 00:41:16.340
然后海水又会退回去
and then back out again.


530
00:41:16.340 --> 00:41:17.910
我想去看看
I want to see that.


531
00:41:17.910 --> 00:41:22.880
我想把脚放在温暖的沙滩上 感受上涨时海水击打的凉意
I want to put my feet on the warm sand and have them cooled by the lapping water.


532
00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:27.220
你爸爸呢？他不指望你养活吗？
What about your father? Doesn't he depend on you?


533
00:41:27.220 --> 00:41:28.820
我是个好儿子
I am a good son.


534
00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:31.830
但他可不是个好爸爸
But he is not a good father.


535
00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:36.330
如果你在海边 你会干什么？
What will you do by the sea?


536
00:41:36.330 --> 00:41:41.370
做些小买卖 跟现在差不多 不过是为了我自己
I'd buy things and sell things, like I do here, but for myself.


537
00:41:41.370 --> 00:41:45.470
有的人去海边 什么事情也不做
There are people who go to the edge of the water to do nothing.


538
00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:48.880
他们只是戴着墨镜坐在那里看海
They just sit there and they look at the sea with their sunglasses on


539
00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:50.980
或带着游泳圈游泳
or swim about on floating tubes.


540
00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:53.950
那我可以向他们卖这些东西
So I could sell them those things.


541
00:41:53.950 --> 00:41:56.950
听起来是个好主意啊 德利瓦
Hmm. That sounds nice, Deliwar.


542
00:41:56.950 --> 00:41:59.120
也许我们可以合伙
And maybe I'll join you.


543
00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:01.290
- 你想要去哪？ - 祝我好运吧
- Where are you going? - Wish me luck.


544
00:42:08.900 --> 00:42:12.470
- 你怎么回来这么早？ - 我给扎西带了一些面包和葡萄干
- Why are you back so early? - I have brought some bread and raisins for Zaki.


545
00:42:12.470 --> 00:42:14.270
你想做什么 帕尔瓦娜？
What are you doing, Parvana?


546
00:42:14.270 --> 00:42:15.870
我要去找爸爸
I'm going to find Baba.


547
00:42:15.870 --> 00:42:17.540
- 不行 你不能去  - 我必须去
- No, you're not. - I'm going.


548
00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:19.570
宵禁之前你是赶不回来的
You won't make it home before curfew.


549
00:42:19.570 --> 00:42:21.940
我一定要去 你阻止不了我
I'm going. There's nothing you can do to stop me.


550
00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:25.380
妈妈已经很受罪了 你别做蠢事来雪上加霜了
Mama-jan has been through enough without you doing something so stupid.


551
00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:27.480
- 我必须找到爸爸  - 帕尔瓦娜
- I have to find him. - Parvana!


552
00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:29.220
帕尔瓦娜
Parvana!


553
00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:31.350
帕尔瓦娜
Parvana!


554
00:43:35.150 --> 00:43:36.550
有人吗？
Excuse me.


555
00:43:36.550 --> 00:43:39.050
问安 有人吗？
Salaam. Hello!


556
00:43:39.050 --> 00:43:41.020
有人吗？
Excuse me!


557
00:43:41.020 --> 00:43:43.360
你想怎样？
What do you want?


558
00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:46.160
- 我说了 你想怎样？  - 我想见见我爸爸
- I said, what do you want? - I want to see my father.


559
00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:49.090
- 谁？  - 我的爸爸 拿孺拉·阿利在
- Who? - My father, Nurullah Alizai.


560
00:43:49.100 --> 00:43:51.030
两个星期前无故被带到这里
Brought here two weeks ago without charge.


561
00:43:51.030 --> 00:43:53.970
- 滚开   - 我有钱......1000阿富汗尼
- Get out of here. - I have money... 1,000 afghani.


562
00:43:53.970 --> 00:43:56.970
- 如果你答应帮助我 钱就归你  - 嘿 你在干什么？
- I can give it to you if you promise to help. - Hey, what are you doing?


563
00:43:56.970 --> 00:43:59.610
没事 只是在赶个孩子走
Nothing. Just getting rid of a kid.


564
00:43:59.610 --> 00:44:01.670
求你了 开门吧
Please! Open up!


565
00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:04.510
我要见我爸爸 我要见他
I have to see my father! I have to see him!


566
00:44:07.010 --> 00:44:09.880
不想挨更多揍就快滚
Now get out of here unless you want some more.


567
00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:53.930
人们说有时雷声大雨点却小
They say it doesn't always rain the way it thunders.


568
00:44:56.030 --> 00:45:00.630
上次故事讲到 男孩摔下了山
Last we heard of him, the boy had fallen down.


569
00:45:00.630 --> 00:45:06.040
他摔下了山 陷入深眠
He had fallen down the hill and into the deepest of sleeps.


570
00:45:06.040 --> 00:45:09.340
但是故事并没有结束
But all was not lost.


571
00:45:09.340 --> 00:45:13.450
他被一个老妪发现
He was discovered by an old woman.


572
00:45:13.450 --> 00:45:15.050
老妪有一个鼓
She had a drum.


573
00:45:16.580 --> 00:45:21.420
一个充满魔力的鼓 鼓声十分优美
A magic drum that beat so beautifully


574
00:45:21.420 --> 00:45:23.660
鼓声唤醒了男孩
that his heart woke up.


575
00:45:34.240 --> 00:45:38.500
她知道这个男孩一定有什么诉求 她便问男孩
She knew he must be on a quest, and so she asked him...


576
00:45:38.510 --> 00:45:41.040
你在找什么？
What is it you seek?


577
00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:44.610
你知道的 恐怖的象王派他的爪牙偷走了...
Well, you see, the dreadful Elephant King sent his jaguars to steal the...


578
00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:50.480
没有人战胜过象王
No one has ever overcome the Elephant King.


579
00:45:50.490 --> 00:45:54.090
- 我知道  - 那你凭什么认为你可以打败他？
- I know. - Well, what makes you think you can?


580
00:45:54.620 --> 00:45:56.090
我必须战胜它
I need to.


581
00:45:56.090 --> 00:45:57.690
我必须战胜它 仅此而已
I just need to, that's all.


582
00:45:57.690 --> 00:46:00.590
这可不是个好答案
That's not a very good answer.


583
00:46:00.590 --> 00:46:05.170
尽管如此 老妪还是告知他需要去寻找三件物品...
Nevertheless, the woman told him he'd need to find three things...


584
00:46:06.770 --> 00:46:09.430
一件闪着光
something that shines,


585
00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:11.770
一件用于抓捕的
something that ensnares,


586
00:46:11.770 --> 00:46:14.110
一件能使人感到平静
and something that soothes.


587
00:46:14.110 --> 00:46:18.210
只有集齐这三件事物 他才可以战胜象王
Only then would he overcome the Elephant King.


588
00:46:18.210 --> 00:46:20.110
把它们都给我吧 拜托了
Give them to me, please!


589
00:46:20.110 --> 00:46:22.110
我可没有
I don't have them,


590
00:46:22.120 --> 00:46:24.080
你还是快去寻找它们
so you'd better go look for them.


591
00:46:24.090 --> 00:46:29.660
要快哦 如果不及时播种 村民可就没有收成了
And hurry! If the seeds are not planted soon, there will be no harvest.


592
00:46:29.660 --> 00:46:31.160
是的 我知道
Yes, I know.


593
00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:33.530
她告诉男孩要去东边
She told him to head east.


594
00:46:33.530 --> 00:46:36.460
那边才是东
East is the other way.


595
00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:40.800
那个未知的东西一直尾随着男孩
Still something followed the boy,


596
00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:44.210
而男孩还是不敢面对它
and still he could not face it.


597
00:47:03.820 --> 00:47:07.230
- 他没收下钱？  - 我觉着贿赂他们没用
- He didn't take the money? - I don't think bribes work on them.


598
00:47:07.230 --> 00:47:10.830
不不不 可能钱不够吧
No, no. It probably wasn't enough.


599
00:47:10.830 --> 00:47:12.760
钱太少可能让他感到不爽
It might have insulted him.


600
00:47:12.770 --> 00:47:16.300
你只需要再攒些钱 下次机灵点
You'll just have to save up more and be even smarter next time.


601
00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:19.740
- 啊  - 你要我机灵点？
- Aaah! - I have to be smarter?


602
00:47:19.740 --> 00:47:23.440
我听说有个人给杂工很高的薪水
I've heard there is a guy who pays well for small jobs.


603
00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:25.440
跟我走
Come on.


604
00:47:25.450 --> 00:47:27.750
先生您好 我们来找工作
Sir, we have come to work.


605
00:47:27.750 --> 00:47:30.880
- 你们是？ - 我是德利瓦 这是奥狄什
- And you are? - I'm Deliwar. And this is Aatish.


606
00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:32.680
他是我兄弟
We are brothers.


607
00:47:32.690 --> 00:47:35.120
奥狄什算什么名字？
What kind of a name is Aatish?


608
00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:36.760
我不知道 这要问我们的爸爸了
I don't know. Ask our father.


609
00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:40.460
- 你爸在哪？ - 他在俄国人的枪下殉道了
- Where is your father? - He was martyred by the Russians.


610
00:47:41.330 --> 00:47:43.260
只要价钱公道
We can do any job you want.


611
00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:44.630
我们什么都能做
For the right price.


612
00:47:56.880 --> 00:47:59.180
我想这应该是最后一个了吧
That's the last one, I think.


613
00:47:59.180 --> 00:48:00.880
我们这是在哪？
Where are we anyway?


614
00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:03.850
可算搬完了 你们这两个孩子真弱
About time. You boys are not very strong.


615
00:48:03.850 --> 00:48:05.780
这可比你说的工作重多了
It was more work than you said.


616
00:48:05.790 --> 00:48:07.850
这是你们的报酬 快走开吧
Here you are. Now be off.


617
00:48:07.860 --> 00:48:10.390
嘿 我们可都是按你说的做的
Hey, we did all that you asked.


618
00:48:10.390 --> 00:48:13.220
等等 你说过要把我们带回去的
Wait! You said you'd drive us back.


619
00:48:13.230 --> 00:48:15.360
我可不是出租车司机 自己回家吧
I'm not a taxi. Make your own way home.


620
00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:18.860
你们装货这么慢已经让我迟到了
I'm late already because you took so long to load the truck.


621
00:48:18.870 --> 00:48:20.630
等等
Wait!


622
00:48:38.320 --> 00:48:40.390
我得休息会
I need to rest a moment.


623
00:48:40.390 --> 00:48:43.390
沿着路走 这个地方可能有地雷
Stay on the path. This place might be mined.


624
00:49:05.610 --> 00:49:08.610
这点钱可不够 我们需要更好的工作
This is not nearly enough. We need better jobs.


625
00:49:08.620 --> 00:49:11.720
- 比如呢？ - 我听说烧砖挣的钱挺多
- Like what? - I heard brick making pays well.


626
00:49:11.720 --> 00:49:13.660
但会很累
But it's hard work.


627
00:49:15.390 --> 00:49:17.560
真希望我能更强壮一些
I wish I was stronger.


628
00:49:17.560 --> 00:49:19.760
可你不是有个哥哥吗？
But you have an older brother, don't you?


629
00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:22.330
以前他总是让你骑在脖子上 带你去上学
He used to bring you to school on his shoulders.


630
00:49:22.330 --> 00:49:25.230
他叫什么？
What's his name?


631
00:49:25.230 --> 00:49:26.670
苏莱曼
Sulayman.


632
00:49:28.840 --> 00:49:31.240
他已经去世了
He died.


633
00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:33.740
什么原因？疾病？
How? Was it the sickness?


634
00:49:33.740 --> 00:49:36.410
- 我不知道 - 可你妈妈应该跟你讲过吧
- I don't know. - But your mother must have told you.


635
00:49:36.410 --> 00:49:38.580
她从没提起过 懂吗？
She doesn't speak of it. All right?


636
00:49:40.950 --> 00:49:42.580
好吧
All right.


637
00:49:45.750 --> 00:49:48.720
嘿 看看这个
Hey, look what I've got.


638
00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:52.720
我在我爸爸的小收纳箱里发现的
I found it in a little box where my father keeps his things.


639
00:49:52.730 --> 00:49:55.960
你能相信海水竟是如此的蓝吗？
Can you believe the water is that blue?


640
00:49:55.960 --> 00:49:57.770
这真漂亮
It's very nice.


641
00:50:05.710 --> 00:50:08.610

Anything written! Anything read!


644
00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:17.520
上次我没付钱
I didn't pay you last time.


645
00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:20.350
- 该给你多少？ - 没关系的 呃...
- How much do I owe you? - It's okay. I...


646
00:50:20.350 --> 00:50:22.590
怎么 坏消息就不收费吗？
What, you don't charge for bad news?


647
00:50:27.730 --> 00:50:30.330
是谁教你识字的？那个残疾的老师吗？
Who taught you to read? The crippled teacher?


648
00:50:30.330 --> 00:50:32.060
嗯 他是我叔叔
Yes. My uncle.


649
00:50:32.070 --> 00:50:34.530
你写信跟读信一样厉害吗？
Can you write as good as you read?


650
00:50:34.530 --> 00:50:35.800
我可以的
I can.


651
00:50:37.710 --> 00:50:39.370
瞧
Here.


652
00:50:41.940 --> 00:50:44.510
我觉得你可能会要回这封信 所以就一直留着呢
I kept this in case you wanted it.


653
00:50:45.610 --> 00:50:48.050
告诉我 告诉我哪处是她的名字
Show me. Show me where it says her name.


654
00:50:48.050 --> 00:50:50.520
哪写了“哈拉”
Where it says "Hala."


655
00:50:52.620 --> 00:50:54.420
那儿 看到了吗？
There. See?


656
00:50:55.090 --> 00:50:56.720
哈拉
Hala.


657
00:51:14.510 --> 00:51:16.880
你知道哈拉是什么意思吗？
Do you know what it means?


658
00:51:16.880 --> 00:51:18.550
不知道
No.


659
00:51:19.780 --> 00:51:23.680
有时候 在你透过晴朗的夜空看月亮时
Sometimes, on a clear night when you look at the moon,


660
00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:26.350
能看到月亮被一条明亮的光圈围绕着
you can see a bright outline around it.


661
00:51:27.590 --> 00:51:30.990
那条光圈就叫作哈拉
That outline is called hala.


662
00:51:30.990 --> 00:51:34.430
我妻子以它来取名
My wife was named for that light.


663
00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:45.400
- 给你 - 这太多了
- Here. - This is too much.


664
00:51:45.410 --> 00:51:47.640
别推辞
Don't argue with me.


665
00:51:47.640 --> 00:51:48.880
谢谢你
Thank you.


666
00:52:00.450 --> 00:52:04.120
好啦 扎西 我可以揪你的吗？
Stop it, Zaki. Can I pull yours?


667
00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:08.990
让他安静点 我还想睡觉呢
Keep him quiet. I'm trying to sleep.


668
00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:12.900
- 你犯什么毛病呢？ - 要不你给扎西讲个故事吧 好不好？
- What's the matter with you? - Why don't you tell Zaki a story, hmm?


669
00:52:12.900 --> 00:52:14.600
我们都很喜欢
We'd all like that.


670
00:52:14.600 --> 00:52:17.970
好吧 扎西 你想听故事里的小男孩后来怎么样了吗？
Well, Zaki, do you want to know what happened to the boy?


671
00:52:19.670 --> 00:52:21.940
好的 好的 还有大象
Yes, yes, and the elephant.


672
00:52:23.510 --> 00:52:27.810
男孩跑啊跑 他很害怕 心跳得特别快
The boy ran and ran, his heart beating fast in fear.


673
00:52:27.820 --> 00:52:30.980
身后追逐他的东西丝毫没有停下的意思
And the thing that chased him never stopped.


674
00:52:33.750 --> 00:52:37.560
于是小男孩非常害怕地躲在树后
So the boy hid behind a tree and he waited for courage.


675
00:52:44.930 --> 00:52:48.170
一位老妇人想要挤山羊奶
An ancient woman had been trying to milk a goat,


676
00:52:48.170 --> 00:52:50.600
可她后背酸痛难忍
but her back was very sore.


677
00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:56.040
我的背好痛啊
My back is very sore.


678
00:52:56.040 --> 00:53:00.680
男孩很同情老妇人 于是让老妇人在树荫下休息
The boy took pity on her and told her to rest under the shade of a tree


679
00:53:00.680 --> 00:53:02.750
他来挤羊奶
and he would do the milking instead.


680
00:53:02.750 --> 00:53:04.850
您到树荫下坐着吧
Please sit under the shade of this tree,


681
00:53:04.850 --> 00:53:07.520
我来帮您挤
and I will do the milking instead.


682
00:53:14.760 --> 00:53:16.800
当他挤完羊奶后
When he finished milking the goat,


683
00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:19.900
老妇人与他分享美味又温暖的羊奶
the old woman shared the lovely, warm milk with him.


684
00:53:19.900 --> 00:53:23.870
这是他喝过最好喝的羊奶
It was the nicest milk he had ever tasted,


685
00:53:23.870 --> 00:53:26.540
于是他称赞老了妇人的羊群
and he complimented the woman on her goats.


686
00:53:26.540 --> 00:53:28.740
您山羊的产奶量真多
Your goats are very generous.


687
00:53:28.740 --> 00:53:31.980
老妇人给男孩一面镜子作为回报
In return, the old woman gave him a mirror.


688
00:53:31.980 --> 00:53:36.180
看 多闪啊
See how it shines!


689
00:53:36.180 --> 00:53:38.680
得到镜子后 男孩非常高兴
The boy was delighted with the mirror,


690
00:53:38.690 --> 00:53:43.790
但他看着镜子时 镜子照出了尾随他的东西
but as he looked into it, he saw the reflection of the thing that followed him!


691
00:53:48.090 --> 00:53:49.760
妈妈 你在做什么？
What are you doing, Mama-jan?


692
00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:52.560
我在收拾苏拉娅的衣服
I'm laying out Soraya's good clothes.


693
00:53:52.570 --> 00:53:54.900
这些衣服要我拿到市场去卖吗？
Am I to sell them at the market?


694
00:53:54.900 --> 00:53:57.910
嘘 帕尔瓦娜 该睡觉了
Shh, shh, shh, Parvana. It's time to sleep.


695
00:54:06.050 --> 00:54:09.680
我得想方设法去白沙瓦
I just need to find a way to get to Peshawar,


696
00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:11.820
在那里我会计划出属于我的未来
and I can figure it out from there.


697
00:54:11.820 --> 00:54:14.220
我想果阿会有海滩
I think there's a beach in Goa


698
00:54:14.220 --> 00:54:16.590
那的游客非常富有
where the tourists are very rich.


699
00:54:16.590 --> 00:54:18.790
如果他们有钱 那我的蓝色石头就能卖出去了
If they're rich, they would buy my blue stones,


700
00:54:18.790 --> 00:54:22.130
在那我就能经营我的小生意了 届时你就可以跟我合伙干了
and that's where I'd set up my business, and you could join me.


701
00:54:22.130 --> 00:54:24.260
在我找到爸爸后
Once I find Baba.


702
00:54:24.260 --> 00:54:26.600
嗯 在你找到你爸爸后
Once you find your Baba.


703
00:54:45.850 --> 00:54:47.150
100

704
00:54:47.150 --> 00:54:48.650
85呗
I'll give you 85.


705
00:54:48.660 --> 00:54:49.890
- 90最低 - 82怎么样
- Ninety. - Eighty-two.


706
00:54:49.890 --> 00:54:51.890
最少85了
Eighty-five, and that's final.


707
00:54:51.890 --> 00:54:54.530
再加上一串葡萄 就这么定了
Eighty-five and a bunch of grapes, and that's final.


708
00:54:59.300 --> 00:55:03.770
你写字下笔太重了 但字写得不错
You're leaning too hard on the pen, but your writing is good.


709
00:55:03.770 --> 00:55:06.540
如果你再温柔一点 写好字会更容易些
If you try it more gently, it'll be easier.


710
00:55:43.340 --> 00:55:45.710
等等 请等一下
Wait! Wait a moment!


711
00:55:47.350 --> 00:55:49.210
什么事？
What is it, child?


712
00:55:49.220 --> 00:55:52.920
你曾问过我之前坐在我身边的那...那个老师的情况
You asked me before about the man who used to sit there... the teacher.


713
00:55:52.920 --> 00:55:56.050
- 你叔叔？ - 他不是去了马扎里沙里夫
- Your uncle? - He didn't go to Mazar-e-Sharif.


714
00:55:56.060 --> 00:55:59.220
我叔叔进了监狱 然而他是冤枉的
He was taken to prison. But he did nothing wrong.


715
00:55:59.230 --> 00:56:00.790
- 哪一个？ - 什么哪一个？
- Which one? - What?


716
00:56:00.790 --> 00:56:03.090
- 哪所监狱？ - 普利查西监狱
- Which prison? - Pul-e-Charkhi.


717
00:56:03.100 --> 00:56:06.630
已经过了几个星期了 但仍就杳无音信
It's been weeks now, and my family has had no word of him.


718
00:56:08.700 --> 00:56:10.670
星期三去监狱一趟吧
Go to the prison on Wednesday.


719
00:56:10.670 --> 00:56:12.340
去找我表弟罗尚帮忙
Ask for Roshan. He's my cousin.


720
00:56:12.340 --> 00:56:15.910
告诉他是拉扎克让你来的 他力所能及的话 就会帮你的
Tell him Razaq sent you and he will help you, if he can.


721
00:56:42.340 --> 00:56:43.740
德利瓦
Deliwar!


722
00:56:43.740 --> 00:56:49.240
照这样干下去 等我到海边的那天 我都变成风烛残年的老太太了
With work like this, I'll be an old woman by the time I get to the sea.


723
00:56:49.240 --> 00:56:52.080
或是个老头儿
Or an old man.


724
00:56:57.280 --> 00:57:01.390
你坐着休息下 我给你讲个故事
You sit and rest, Deliwar, and I'll tell you a story.


725
00:57:01.390 --> 00:57:04.660
- 故事？ - 对呀
- A story? - Yes, a story.


726
00:57:05.760 --> 00:57:07.320
在很久很久以前
One time in the deep past,


727
00:57:07.330 --> 00:57:11.900
从前有一个小男孩 他要把怪物偷走的袋子带回到村里 袋子里装着的是十分珍贵的种子
there was a boy who had to return a stolen bag of precious seeds to his village.


728
00:57:11.900 --> 00:57:15.330
是个喜剧吗 还是...悲剧呢？
Is it a happy story or a sad story?


729
00:57:15.340 --> 00:57:17.640
你听完就知道了
Just wait and see.


730
00:57:18.970 --> 00:57:22.010
男孩得知 必须集齐三件事物
The boy had been told he needed three things


731
00:57:22.010 --> 00:57:25.180
才能战胜象王
in order to overcome the Elephant King...


732
00:57:25.180 --> 00:57:29.050
一件闪着光 一件用来抓捕的 和...
something that shines, something that ensnares and something that...


733
00:57:29.050 --> 00:57:31.920
喂 你们两个 过来
Hey, you two! Come here!


734
00:57:33.290 --> 00:57:35.120
来啊
Come on!


735
00:57:35.120 --> 00:57:36.720
我认识他
I know that boy.


736
00:57:36.720 --> 00:57:39.260
快点 马上过来
Hurry up. Come here.


737
00:57:39.260 --> 00:57:40.890
快点啊
Come on.


738
00:57:40.890 --> 00:57:43.700
我们最好听他的话过去
We'd better do what we're told.


739
00:57:46.800 --> 00:57:48.840
赶快啊 懒鬼
Get a move on, lazy kids.


740
00:57:57.040 --> 00:57:59.080
这就是新来的苦力？
So these are the new workers?


741
00:57:59.080 --> 00:58:01.950
快回答啊 你们是傻子吗？
Where are your tongues? Are you stupid?


742
00:58:01.950 --> 00:58:05.150
伊德瑞斯提议用掰手腕的方式来做个小测验
Idrees suggested we have a little arm-wrestling match.


743
00:58:06.150 --> 00:58:09.250
看看你们是否有资格为我工作
To see if you're strong enough to work for me.


744
00:58:09.260 --> 00:58:11.890
我看到你坐在那儿偷懒
I saw you sitting down over there instead of working.


745
00:58:11.890 --> 00:58:13.890
停下 伊德瑞斯
Idrees, stop now.


746
00:58:13.890 --> 00:58:15.860
给我来杯茶水
Make me some tea.


747
00:58:19.830 --> 00:58:22.770
小不点 让我见识下你有多废物
Let me see how feeble you are, little one.


748
00:58:24.040 --> 00:58:26.310
这弱鸡连手都抬不起来
He can't even lift his hand.


749
00:58:27.940 --> 00:58:30.240
起来吧 端点茶水来
Get up and make us tea.


750
00:58:31.510 --> 00:58:34.980
叔叔 我觉得你需要招新工人了
Uncle, I think you need new workers.


751
00:58:34.980 --> 00:58:37.850
- 这两个简直太废了 - 够了 伊德瑞斯
- These ones are no good. - Enough, Idrees.


752
00:58:37.850 --> 00:58:39.480
别难为这些可怜的娃了
Leave the poor kids alone.


753
00:58:39.490 --> 00:58:41.990
他们俩还是太嫩
They are a little undercooked.


754
00:58:45.830 --> 00:58:48.130
我知道你
I know you.


755
00:58:48.130 --> 00:58:50.330
你是那个老师的女...
You're the teacher's daugh...


756
00:58:55.800 --> 00:58:57.940
伊德瑞斯
Idrees.


757
00:58:57.940 --> 00:58:59.940
把枪拿回来
Bring the gun back!


758
00:58:59.940 --> 00:59:01.970
我说了 把枪拿回来
I said bring the gun back!


759
00:59:01.970 --> 00:59:04.880
伊德瑞斯
Idrees!


760
00:59:23.300 --> 00:59:25.100
滚出来
Come out now!


761
00:59:28.440 --> 00:59:30.470
给我滚出来
Come out now!


762
00:59:30.470 --> 00:59:33.770
伊德瑞斯 战争已经开始了 我们要向西转移
Idrees, it has begun! We are moving west.


763
00:59:34.840 --> 00:59:37.610
我们接到命令要立刻行动
We have been given orders to go immediately!


764
00:59:37.610 --> 00:59:39.840
我知道你是谁
I know who you are!


765
00:59:39.850 --> 00:59:41.350
你听见了吗？
Do you hear?


766
00:59:42.450 --> 00:59:44.550
快上来 快
Get up here! Come on!


767
00:59:46.290 --> 00:59:48.920
现在就上来 你个怂包
Right now! You little coward!


768
00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:54.930
你不是想参战吗？ 现在你的机会来了
You want to fight? Now is your chance to fight!


769
00:59:56.900 --> 00:59:58.300
做个男人吧
You become a man.


770
01:00:21.260 --> 01:00:23.550
他走了
He's gone.


771
01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:25.620
他要是回来了呢？
What if he comes back?


772
01:00:25.630 --> 01:00:27.930
那只能算他运气好
He'd be lucky.


773
01:00:27.930 --> 01:00:29.490
我们这是在哪？
Where are we?


774
01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:31.900
我逃跑时候来过这里一次
I came here once when I ran away.


775
01:00:31.900 --> 01:00:35.970
不知道是我身体长大了 还是进来的洞口变窄了
I think the way in has gotten smaller or I have gotten bigger.


776
01:00:36.670 --> 01:00:38.440
这东西看起来有点历史了
It looks old.


777
01:00:39.340 --> 01:00:41.010
我丢了一只鞋
I lost a shoe.


778
01:00:41.010 --> 01:00:44.510
我帽子也丢了 可我觉得它就在外面
I lost my cap, although I think it's outside.


779
01:00:44.510 --> 01:00:46.350
你为什么揍他？
Why did you hit him?


780
01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:51.420
把我爸绑走的那伙人里有他一个
When they took my father, he was one of them.


781
01:00:53.550 --> 01:00:55.290
再给我讲讲那个男孩吧
Tell me more about the boy.


782
01:00:55.290 --> 01:00:56.990
什么男孩？
What boy?


783
01:00:56.990 --> 01:00:58.960
故事里的那个男孩
The story boy.


784
01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:01.690
男孩觉得很冷
The boy was cold.


785
01:01:01.690 --> 01:01:05.300
虽然太阳挂在空中 他却感受不到一丝温暖
Though the sun burned in the sky, it gave no heat.


786
01:01:05.300 --> 01:01:08.300
但是他有一个又大又暖的外套
But he had a warm hat and a big coat.


787
01:01:08.300 --> 01:01:10.030
不 他没有
No, he didn't.


788
01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:12.500
他已经发现三件事物中的一件了...
He had already found one of the three things...


789
01:01:12.510 --> 01:01:14.410
一个闪光的镜子
a mirror that shone.


790
01:01:14.410 --> 01:01:18.040
但是当他往镜子里看时 他看到了他身后的东西
But when he looked at it, he saw something behind him.


791
01:01:18.050 --> 01:01:20.710
那东西很吓人 非常恐怖
Something scary. Something dreadful!


792
01:01:20.710 --> 01:01:23.680
- 是一匹马 - 不 什沃吉亚 不是一匹马
- A horse! - No, Shauzia, not a horse.


793
01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:25.580
是啊 就是一匹马
Yes, it was.


794
01:01:25.590 --> 01:01:29.190
还是一匹非常老的马 走起路来骨头都咔哒咔哒响
And it was a very old horse whose bones clattered together when it walked.


795
01:01:29.190 --> 01:01:32.420
这一点都不吓人
It wasn't scary at all.


796
01:01:32.430 --> 01:01:36.730
好吧  看到老马的样子 男孩感到很难过 于是他喂了它一些干草
Fine. The boy felt sad for the old horse and fed him hay.


797
01:01:36.730 --> 01:01:38.700
然后他们都过上了幸福的生活
And they all lived happily ever after.


798
01:01:38.700 --> 01:01:41.430
我才讲到故事的一半 这不是结局
It's the middle of the story, not the end!


799
01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:44.200
从一个石室的门里
From a door carved into the stone,


800
01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:46.500
走出来一个胖子
out came a round man.


801
01:01:46.510 --> 01:01:50.570
你竟然把我的干草浪费在一匹即将死去的老马身上
You wasted my hay on an old horse that will soon be dead!


802
01:01:50.580 --> 01:01:53.680
胖子把男孩扔进了一口古井的深处
The round man threw the boy deep into the belly of an ancient well.


803
01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:56.280
啊..
Aaah!


804
01:01:57.550 --> 01:02:00.180
在井的底部有绿宝石
At the bottom of the well there were emeralds,


805
01:02:00.190 --> 01:02:04.260
胖子想让男孩把绿宝石拿给他 作为男孩浪费干草的补偿
and the round man wanted them brought up to him as payment for the wasted hay.


806
01:02:04.260 --> 01:02:06.620
你得把那些绿宝石拿给我
You will bring the emeralds to me.


807
01:02:06.630 --> 01:02:08.660
- 他的名字是？ - 你问的是那个胖子的？
- What's his name? - The round man?


808
01:02:08.660 --> 01:02:10.430
不是 是那个男孩的名字
No, the boy.


809
01:02:10.430 --> 01:02:13.660
你不能光讲人家男孩的故事 不给人家起个名字
You can't have a story about a boy and not give him a name.


810
01:02:13.670 --> 01:02:15.600
你不起我可要给他起名字了啊
Give him a name before I do.


811
01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:17.470
苏莱曼
Sulayman.


812
01:02:17.470 --> 01:02:19.970
他叫苏莱曼
His name is Sulayman.


813
01:02:20.610 --> 01:02:22.440
这是个好名字
That's a good name.


814
01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:25.410
苏莱曼倒在井的底部
Sulayman lay at the bottom of the well.


815
01:02:25.410 --> 01:02:28.510
突然 他看到了几具骷髅
Suddenly, he could see skeletons.


816
01:02:28.510 --> 01:02:33.350
一共3具骷髅 它们的骨手里都攥着一颗绿宝石
Three skeletons, each with an emerald clutched in its bony hands.


817
01:02:33.350 --> 01:02:35.190
- 他大声呼救 - 救命
- He called out for help. - Help!


818
01:02:35.190 --> 01:02:38.320
那匹可怜的老马从井口向下望着他
The poor old horse looked back at him from way above.


819
01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:41.230
然后它做了一件很神奇的事情
But the horse did something extraordinary.


820
01:02:41.230 --> 01:02:44.160
它发出了世界上所有种动物的叫声
He neighed with the voice of all the world's animals.


821
01:02:53.810 --> 01:02:57.110
苏莱曼爬啊爬 终于爬到了井的顶部
Sulayman climbed up, up, all the way to the top,


822
01:02:57.110 --> 01:02:59.480
然后他对救他一命的老马表示了感谢
and he thanked the horse for saving his life.


823
01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:02.320
谢谢你救了我的命
Thank you for saving my life.


824
01:03:07.190 --> 01:03:09.650
苏莱曼拿到了那三块宝石
Sulayman had just three emeralds with him...


825
01:03:09.660 --> 01:03:12.660
于是他要求胖子用食物来换
And asked the round man for food in return.


826
01:03:12.660 --> 01:03:14.390
他很饿
He was hungry.


827
01:03:14.390 --> 01:03:16.660
但那胖子即卑鄙又很小气
But the round man was wicked and cheap.


828
01:03:16.660 --> 01:03:20.530
他扔给了苏莱曼一个渔网 让他自己捕鱼吃
He threw a fishing net at Sulayman and he told him to get his own food.


829
01:03:20.530 --> 01:03:23.800
- 这网正是苏莱曼所需之物 - 哈哈
- That was exactly what Sulayman needed. - Ha-ha!


830
01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:26.200
那件用来抓捕的事物
Something that ensnares.


831
01:03:26.210 --> 01:03:27.810
但在苏莱曼的离开后
But as Sulayman left,


832
01:03:27.810 --> 01:03:31.540
三具骷髅的鬼魂从宝石里出来了
the ghosts of the three skeletons came out of the three emeralds


833
01:03:31.550 --> 01:03:34.510
它们在胖子头上缠转盘旋 吓得胖子魂不附体
and swirled and twirled and scared the round man


834
01:03:34.510 --> 01:03:37.820
用如此手段来向害他们丧命的胖子复仇
in frightful vengeance for having lost them their lives.


835
01:03:42.090 --> 01:03:45.720
苏莱曼和那匹老马继续向山那边进发
Sulayman and the horse continued their journey toward the mountain,


836
01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:49.230
但老马越走越慢了
but the horse was getting slower and slower.


837
01:03:49.230 --> 01:03:52.600
它实在是太老了 需要休息
He needed to rest, being very, very old,


838
01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:55.500
于是苏莱曼为它搭了一个帐篷
and so Sulayman made a shelter for the horse


839
01:03:55.500 --> 01:03:58.200
然后让这匹马等他回来
and told him to wait for him.


840
01:03:58.210 --> 01:04:00.570
那匹马有意阻止男孩...
The horse protested...


841
01:04:00.570 --> 01:04:04.510
但苏莱曼知道 象王和它的爪牙
but Sulayman knew he had to face the Elephant King and the jaguars


842
01:04:04.510 --> 01:04:06.140
他必须亲自去面对
all by himself.


843
01:04:06.150 --> 01:04:08.180
我们会再见面的 老伙计
I will see you again, old horse.


844
01:04:10.380 --> 01:04:12.450
说完他就一个人上路了
And so on he went alone.


845
01:04:24.860 --> 01:04:27.200
明天是星期三
Tomorrow is Wednesday.


846
01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:30.200
我要到监狱去了
I'm going back there, to the prison.


847
01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:34.140
他们到时候会让我见我爸爸的
They'll have to let me see him then.


848
01:04:55.330 --> 01:04:57.360
从现在开始 你就别出门了
From now on, you're staying inside.


849
01:04:57.360 --> 01:04:59.630
- 那么做太危险了 - 不 妈妈
- It's much too dangerous. - No, Mama-jan.


850
01:04:59.630 --> 01:05:01.830
- 我们会一起设法逃出来的 - “我们”？
- We manage all right out there. - "We"?


851
01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:05.770
我和德利瓦 她也是个女孩 我们一起工作
Me and Deliwar. She's a girl too. We work together.


852
01:05:05.770 --> 01:05:09.510
我们已经给我表兄写信了 让他们给你姐姐在马扎安排一门亲事
We've written to my cousin to arrange a marriage for your sister in Mazar


853
01:05:09.510 --> 01:05:11.640
他们回信表示同意
They wrote back, and it was accepted.


854
01:05:11.650 --> 01:05:14.510
后天会有人来把我们带走
Someone will come for us the day after tomorrow to take us away.


855
01:05:14.510 --> 01:05:16.410
- 你以后不用再冒险去监狱了 - 什么？
- You don't need to do this anymore. - What?


856
01:05:16.420 --> 01:05:18.420
这日子不能这么过
We can't go on like this.


857
01:05:18.420 --> 01:05:20.920
- 我们不能靠你养活啊 - 为什么？
- We can't depend on you to keep us alive. - Why?


858
01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:22.790
我现在挣的钱足够养家了
I provide for you just fine.


859
01:05:22.790 --> 01:05:24.960
这不是一个孩子的工作
It's not the job of a child.


860
01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:27.490
我们怎么能撇下爸爸离开
How can we leave without Baba?


861
01:05:27.490 --> 01:05:29.960
每天你回家的时候 身上都带着伤口
Every day you come home with cuts and blisters.


862
01:05:29.960 --> 01:05:33.670
每天你出去工作 我都不知能否看到你安然归来
Every day you go out there, and I don't know if I'll see you back again.


863
01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:36.800
我不能连你也失去
I can't lose you too.


864
01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:38.800
我不会去的
I'm not going.


865
01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:41.870
爸爸会回来的 我们走了 家里就没人等他了
Baba could come back, and no one will be here waiting for him.


866
01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:44.310
那我们要等多久
So how long should we wait?


867
01:05:44.310 --> 01:05:46.740
等到他们发现你是女孩 然后也把你从我身边夺走吗？
Until you're found out and taken away from me?


868
01:05:46.750 --> 01:05:48.980
等到我不得不把扎西送出去 来赚钱养家吗？
Until I have to send Zaki out to earn our keep?


869
01:05:48.980 --> 01:05:51.280
在我们离开之前 让我去看看他吧
Let me go see him before we leave.


870
01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:53.480
好让他知道我们要去的是哪
Let me tell him where we are going.


871
01:05:53.490 --> 01:05:55.890
- 帕尔瓦娜 - 让我帮他把手杖带上
- Parvana! - Let me bring him his walking stick.


872
01:05:55.890 --> 01:05:57.620
然后我就跟你走
Then I will go with you.


873
01:05:57.620 --> 01:06:01.560
我会做一个好妹妹 一个好女儿
Then I will be a good sister and a good daughter.


874
01:06:01.560 --> 01:06:03.160
我发誓
I promise.


875
01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:05.570
我保证
I promise.


876
01:06:20.650 --> 01:06:22.310
听话 不要走
Please don't go.


877
01:06:22.320 --> 01:06:24.880
听妈妈的吧  现在外面太危险了
Please, it is much too dangerous now.


878
01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:27.450
妈妈 我走了
Mama-jan, I'm going.


879
01:06:27.450 --> 01:06:29.320
宵禁之前我一定回来
I'll be back tonight before curfew.


880
01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:31.860
- 不要 苏莱曼 - 妈妈
- No, Sulayman. - Mama-jan.


881
01:06:31.860 --> 01:06:35.330
- 你赶不回来的 - 让她去吧
- You won't come back. - Let her go now.


882
01:06:35.330 --> 01:06:37.460
让帕瓦尔娜去吧
Let Parvana go.


883
01:06:44.670 --> 01:06:46.610
哦
Oh!


884
01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:55.620
帕瓦尔娜
Parvana.


885
01:07:31.650 --> 01:07:33.290
德利瓦
Deliwar!


886
01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:37.660
你差点把我吓死
You frightened me half to death.


887
01:07:37.660 --> 01:07:39.660
我一直在到处找你
I've been looking for you everywhere.


888
01:07:39.660 --> 01:07:42.590
找我干嘛？想跟我一起去柴家商店干活吗？
Why? You want to work at the chai shop with me this morning?


889
01:07:42.590 --> 01:07:46.500
- 不 我不行 - 嘿 你想给扎西弄些糖果吗？
- No, I can't. - Hey, you want some candy for Zaki?


890
01:07:46.500 --> 01:07:49.340
明天我们就要离开喀布尔
We are leaving Kabul tomorrow.


891
01:07:50.940 --> 01:07:52.800
你要离开我吗？
You are leaving me?


892
01:07:52.810 --> 01:07:55.940
家里都安排好了 我也无能为力
It's been arranged. There's nothing I can do.


893
01:07:55.940 --> 01:08:00.080
我姐姐就要去马札里沙里夫结婚了
My sister is getting married in Mazar-e-Sharif.


894
01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:01.680
我还要再去一次监狱
I'm going back to the prison.


895
01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:03.680
我找到了一个能帮我的人
I found someone who can help me,


896
01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:05.920
而且我需要更多的钱来贿赂看守
and I need to get more money to bribe the guard.


897
01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:07.820
今天是最后期限了
I'll need it today.


898
01:08:07.820 --> 01:08:10.990
你只会挨更多拳头的 这个想法很愚蠢
You'll just get another punch in the guts. It's a stupid idea.


899
01:08:10.990 --> 01:08:12.820
这次不会的
I won't let that happen this time.


900
01:08:12.830 --> 01:08:15.960
- 我说了这个想法很愚蠢 - 求你了帮帮我吧
- I said it's a stupid idea. - Please help me.


901
01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:17.830
你想让我怎么做？
What do you want me to do?


902
01:08:17.830 --> 01:08:21.100
像你的儿童故事里那样 用魔法变出一些钱来给你吗？
Magic some money into your hand like in your kids' stories?


903
01:08:21.100 --> 01:08:23.800
那是行不通的 帕瓦尔娜
It doesn't work like that, Parvana.


904
01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:25.770
我帮不了你
I can't help you.


905
01:08:25.770 --> 01:08:29.870
赶紧逃到马札里沙里夫 然后享受那美好的婚礼吧
