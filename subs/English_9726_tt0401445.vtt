1
00:01:23.763 --> 00:01:24.639
Max!

2
00:01:24.764 --> 00:01:25.640
Uh-huh?

3
00:01:25.765 --> 00:01:27.517
Ready to concede?

4
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.936
No!

5
00:01:43.783 --> 00:01:45.994
I thought as it's
your last night here,


6
00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:50.081
it only appropriate that we
open something extra special.


7
00:01:50.206 --> 00:01:51.249
Bandol.

8
00:01:51.332 --> 00:01:52.625
Excellent choice.

9
00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.380
Tempier Bandol, 1969.

10
00:01:57.463 --> 00:02:01.009
The kind of wine that'll pickle
even the toughest of men.


11
00:02:01.134 --> 00:02:05.180
I once saw a Castilian prizefighter

12
00:02:05.305 --> 00:02:06.639
collapse in a heap

13
00:02:06.764 --> 00:02:09.726
after drinking just a single glass.

14
00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:12.479
Perhaps my knee landing
squarely in his testicles...


15
00:02:14.147 --> 00:02:16.774
...may have been partly to blame.

16
00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.193
What was I talking about before?

17
00:02:18.318 --> 00:02:20.111
You said the importance
of a good blue suit


18
00:02:20.195 --> 00:02:21.404
can never be overstated.

19
00:02:21.488 --> 00:02:23.031
Quite right.

20
00:02:23.156 --> 00:02:25.909
A blue suit is the most
versatile of accoutrements.


21
00:02:25.992 --> 00:02:27.827
More important
than the suit itself


22
00:02:27.911 --> 00:02:29.621
is the man who fits it for you.

23
00:02:29.746 --> 00:02:31.456
Once you find a good tailor,

24
00:02:31.581 --> 00:02:33.541
you must never give his name away,

25
00:02:33.666 --> 00:02:35.877
not even under the threat

26
00:02:36.002 --> 00:02:37.378
of bodily harm.

27
00:02:43.343 --> 00:02:45.094
Now, where were we?

28
00:02:45.178 --> 00:02:47.013
-Whose turn is it?
-Mine.


29
00:02:47.096 --> 00:02:48.890
Uh-huh.

30
00:02:51.935 --> 00:02:53.853
Uh-huh.

31
00:02:53.978 --> 00:02:56.147
Max, have I told you why I enjoy

32
00:02:56.272 --> 00:02:57.941
-making wine so much?
-You don't


33
00:02:58.024 --> 00:03:00.360
make the wine, Uncle Henry,
that guy Duflot does.


34
00:03:00.485 --> 00:03:02.695
In France,
it's always the landowner


35
00:03:02.821 --> 00:03:04.823
who makes the wine.

36
00:03:04.948 --> 00:03:07.408
Even though he does
nothing more than supervise


37
00:03:07.534 --> 00:03:10.578
with binoculars
from the comfort of his study.


38
00:03:10.703 --> 00:03:14.541
No, I enjoy making wine
because this sublime nectar


39
00:03:14.624 --> 00:03:17.919
is quite simply incapable of lying.

40
00:03:18.044 --> 00:03:20.380
Picked too early,
picked too late, it matters not.


41
00:03:20.505 --> 00:03:23.383
The wine will always whisper
into your mouth


42
00:03:23.508 --> 00:03:25.552
with complete, unabashed honesty,

43
00:03:25.677 --> 00:03:28.847
every time you take a sip.

44
00:03:30.723 --> 00:03:32.267
Mmm,

45
00:03:32.392 --> 00:03:33.852
delightful.

46
00:03:33.977 --> 00:03:35.895
Now, Maximillian,

47
00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:38.439
now you know why
I love wine so much,


48
00:03:38.565 --> 00:03:41.109
have you anything
you want to tell me?


49
00:03:41.234 --> 00:03:42.235
Yes, I do.

50
00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.903
Yes, what is it?

51
00:03:49.033 --> 00:03:50.410
Checkmate.

52
00:03:50.493 --> 00:03:53.204
You little shit.

53
00:04:08.595 --> 00:04:11.639
-Good morning, lab rats.
-Good morning, Max.


54
00:04:11.764 --> 00:04:13.391
Today we're shifting gear.

55
00:04:13.516 --> 00:04:16.060
Today... is Greedy Bastard Day.

56
00:04:18.771 --> 00:04:20.773
The secret to riches, lab rats,

57
00:04:20.857 --> 00:04:24.986
is the same as the secret to comedy...

58
00:04:25.111 --> 00:04:26.571
timing.

59
00:04:26.779 --> 00:04:29.199
-115. 10, Max.

60
00:04:29.282 --> 00:04:31.367
So I thought we should move now.

61
00:04:31.451 --> 00:04:33.453
-Not yet, Alf.
-Boss,


62
00:04:33.536 --> 00:04:34.704
why do you keep calling me Alf?

63
00:04:34.787 --> 00:04:36.706
Because you're an aggressive
little flunky, Kenny.


64
00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:37.790
And as your boss

65
00:04:37.916 --> 00:04:39.375
and genetic superior,

66
00:04:39.459 --> 00:04:41.377
I can call you whatever I want.

67
00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:43.588
Max Skinner's phone.

68
00:04:43.713 --> 00:04:45.131
It's Kimberly.
Is Max there?


69
00:04:45.256 --> 00:04:46.633
Yeah. One moment, please.

70
00:04:46.758 --> 00:04:48.384
It's Kimberly.

71
00:04:51.095 --> 00:04:53.723
-Sorry, Kimberly, Max isn't here.
-Where is he?


72
00:04:53.807 --> 00:04:54.933
He and his fiancÃ©e

73
00:04:55.016 --> 00:04:56.684
are at their wedding
rehearsal today.


74
00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:58.436
-Their what?
-Do you want me to leave him a message?


75
00:04:58.561 --> 00:05:00.146
No, I don't want
to leave him a message!


76
00:05:00.271 --> 00:05:01.439
Okay.

77
00:05:02.607 --> 00:05:04.234
115. 90...

78
00:05:04.317 --> 00:05:07.487
116...

79
00:05:07.612 --> 00:05:08.655
116. 10.

80
00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.073
All right, lab rats, just remember

81
00:05:10.156 --> 00:05:11.574
we're not here for the dental plan.

82
00:05:11.658 --> 00:05:14.702
50 big!
People are buying! Max?


83
00:05:14.828 --> 00:05:16.246
Sell.

84
00:05:20.917 --> 00:05:22.460
That's yours!

85
00:05:25.338 --> 00:05:26.589
I said that's yours!

86
00:05:33.179 --> 00:05:34.889
That miserable sod Skinner's
dumping bonds


87
00:05:35.014 --> 00:05:36.891
-onto the market.
-But he can't do that.


88
00:05:37.016 --> 00:05:38.351
There's a gentleman's agreement
on the exchange.


89
00:05:38.476 --> 00:05:40.270
A gentleman's agreement presupposes

90
00:05:40.353 --> 00:05:42.355
-there's a gentleman involved.
-Amis,


91
00:05:42.438 --> 00:05:44.691
he put out $5 billion
in sell orders-prices are


92
00:05:44.774 --> 00:05:46.192
-crashing through the floor!
-Come on,


93
00:05:46.276 --> 00:05:47.277
people, get off your asses!

94
00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.988
Come on, step to it!
Start selling!


95
00:05:50.071 --> 00:05:51.656
-Sell!

96
00:05:54.701 --> 00:05:56.494
They should bury you
face down, Max,


97
00:05:56.578 --> 00:05:59.122
because that's the way you're going.

98
00:06:04.377 --> 00:06:09.048
Free big figures to 113. 50!

99
00:06:09.174 --> 00:06:10.800
Sell! Sell!

100
00:06:10.884 --> 00:06:12.385
Still going down.

101
00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:13.803
Buy.

102
00:06:13.887 --> 00:06:15.388
Fuckin' buy it all back!

103
00:06:15.472 --> 00:06:17.223
Buy it all back immediately!

104
00:06:17.348 --> 00:06:18.725
Buy it all back!
It's yours to buy back!


105
00:06:18.808 --> 00:06:20.768
Don't worry about it!
Buy it all back!


106
00:06:20.894 --> 00:06:22.270
You're a genius, Max!

107
00:06:25.231 --> 00:06:26.733
Filthy bugger,
he's forced down prices.


108
00:06:26.816 --> 00:06:28.860
He's gonna buy everything back
on the cheap!


109
00:06:28.985 --> 00:06:30.612
Start buying!

110
00:06:30.737 --> 00:06:32.071
Buying now! Start buying!

111
00:06:44.167 --> 00:06:46.002
-I can!
-I can!


112
00:06:46.085 --> 00:06:48.296
Well done today, lab rats.

113
00:06:48.421 --> 00:06:49.422
Wonderful work.

114
00:06:49.547 --> 00:06:51.966
We all made
a spectacular amount of money.


115
00:06:53.176 --> 00:06:55.178
Today we proved the adage that

116
00:06:55.261 --> 00:06:57.180
winning isn't everything...

117
00:06:57.263 --> 00:06:59.265
It's the only thing!

118
00:07:09.901 --> 00:07:11.653
And there were strange goings-on

119
00:07:11.778 --> 00:07:12.862
on the bond market today.

120
00:07:12.946 --> 00:07:17.450
Prices crashed to 112. 5,
after Lorden Brothers


121
00:07:17.575 --> 00:07:20.203
unloaded $3 billion in sell orders.

122
00:07:20.286 --> 00:07:23.623
Then in an extraordinary
move, the company bought the bonds back


123
00:07:23.706 --> 00:07:25.333
at a substantially reduced price,

124
00:07:25.458 --> 00:07:27.794
making over $77 million

125
00:07:27.919 --> 00:07:30.547
-in the process.
-Blimey.


126
00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:32.006
Cries of foul play were loud

127
00:07:32.131 --> 00:07:35.969
and widespread, with talks
of an inquiry to follow.


128
00:07:37.137 --> 00:07:38.304
Morning, Mr. Skinner.

129
00:07:38.429 --> 00:07:40.640
-Morning, Bert.
-And congratulations.


130
00:07:40.765 --> 00:07:42.517
-Thank you.
-You might've tipped me off,


131
00:07:42.642 --> 00:07:43.768
Mr. Skinner.

132
00:07:43.893 --> 00:07:45.812
I'll give you a tip, Bert:

133
00:07:45.895 --> 00:07:48.815
Never pat a burning dog.

134
00:07:49.983 --> 00:07:51.401
Wanker.

135
00:08:39.324 --> 00:08:41.993
Oh, Henry, bloody hell.

136
00:08:43.244 --> 00:08:45.830
<i>Ready for the fan mail?</i>

137
00:08:45.955 --> 00:08:47.790
Shoot, sunshine.

138
00:08:47.874 --> 00:08:49.375
-"Bastard. "
-Uh-huh.


139
00:08:49.459 --> 00:08:50.251
"Bastard. "

140
00:08:50.376 --> 00:08:51.002
Uh-huh.

141
00:08:51.127 --> 00:08:52.253
-"Burn in hell. "
-Right.


142
00:08:52.378 --> 00:08:53.505
"Rot in hell. "

143
00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:54.464
Oh. Lovely.

144
00:08:54.547 --> 00:08:55.423
"Die. "

145
00:08:55.548 --> 00:08:56.090
Charming.

146
00:08:56.216 --> 00:08:57.217
Maxie?

147
00:08:57.342 --> 00:08:59.010
"Congratulations, you're my hero. "

148
00:08:59.135 --> 00:09:00.553
Who said that?

149
00:09:00.637 --> 00:09:01.387
Your lawyer.

150
00:09:01.513 --> 00:09:02.430
-Oh.
-Maxie, listen,


151
00:09:02.555 --> 00:09:05.517
I just got off the phone
with, uh, Auzet.


152
00:09:05.642 --> 00:09:08.436
That's the notaire handling
your Uncle Henry's estate.


153
00:09:08.561 --> 00:09:09.729
She the one that sent me the letter?

154
00:09:09.854 --> 00:09:11.898
Yeah.

155
00:09:12.023 --> 00:09:15.401
Anyway, listen, uh, it seems that

156
00:09:15.527 --> 00:09:16.611
your Uncle Henry

157
00:09:16.736 --> 00:09:18.112
hasn't updated his will

158
00:09:18.238 --> 00:09:19.447
in over 20 years.

159
00:09:19.572 --> 00:09:21.366
Which is why,
in typical frog fashion,


160
00:09:21.449 --> 00:09:22.659
they take over a month

161
00:09:22.742 --> 00:09:23.660
to notify us.

162
00:09:23.743 --> 00:09:25.328
All right, so what
do we do with that?

163
00:09:25.411 --> 00:09:26.496
Is there a reading of the will,

164
00:09:26.579 --> 00:09:27.580
or do we just download

165
00:09:27.705 --> 00:09:29.457
that sort of thing these days?
What happens?


166
00:09:29.582 --> 00:09:31.793
No, that's the point, Max.

167
00:09:31.918 --> 00:09:33.878
Sorry?

168
00:09:34.003 --> 00:09:35.421
There is no legal will.

169
00:09:35.547 --> 00:09:36.422
Really?

170
00:09:36.548 --> 00:09:37.799
You're his closest blood relative,

171
00:09:37.924 --> 00:09:40.468
-so you get everything.
-What, his clothes


172
00:09:40.593 --> 00:09:41.928
and his Edmundo Ross LPs?

173
00:09:43.054 --> 00:09:44.597
The house, you git.

174
00:09:44.722 --> 00:09:46.307
You get to keep his house.

175
00:09:46.432 --> 00:09:47.517
What, the old farmhouse

176
00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:49.310
and the vineyards and
the grapes and everything?


177
00:09:49.435 --> 00:09:53.106
Place like must be worth
a few quid these days.


178
00:09:53.231 --> 00:09:54.732
Hey.

179
00:09:54.858 --> 00:09:55.984
-Hmm.
-Anyway,


180
00:09:56.109 --> 00:09:58.444
I've booked you a flight

181
00:09:58.528 --> 00:10:01.698
and an appointment with Auzet
for 3:00 tomorrow afternoon.


182
00:10:01.781 --> 00:10:03.449
Just a few papers to sign.

183
00:10:03.575 --> 00:10:04.951
Come on, I can't go
to France tomorrow.


184
00:10:05.034 --> 00:10:06.369
Gem, I'm the toast of the town.

185
00:10:06.452 --> 00:10:07.787
I need to do a few victory laps

186
00:10:07.912 --> 00:10:09.581
around the city,
show off a little bit,


187
00:10:09.706 --> 00:10:11.207
have a late night or two.
Oh, come on,


188
00:10:11.291 --> 00:10:12.834
you heard the mail-
it's times like this,


189
00:10:12.959 --> 00:10:14.627
when everyone hates you,
that's when it's fun.


190
00:10:14.752 --> 00:10:15.920
Go on, Max-we'll take good care

191
00:10:16.045 --> 00:10:17.088
of the place when you're gone.

192
00:10:17.213 --> 00:10:18.423
No problems.

193
00:10:18.548 --> 00:10:19.591
Right.

194
00:10:19.716 --> 00:10:21.342
-Ken.
-Mm.


195
00:10:21.468 --> 00:10:22.844
Why don't you go and try and find

196
00:10:22.969 --> 00:10:24.137
some small animals to hurt?

197
00:10:24.262 --> 00:10:27.807
I know, find a poodle and
punt it off the balcony.


198
00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:36.399
Hmm?

199
00:10:36.483 --> 00:10:37.984
-Tell me something, Max.
-Yes?


200
00:10:38.109 --> 00:10:39.986
Did you care for him?

201
00:10:41.112 --> 00:10:42.489
Yes, I did.

202
00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:45.909
When was the last time you spoke?

203
00:10:45.992 --> 00:10:47.118
A long time ago.

204
00:10:47.243 --> 00:10:48.244
Why?

205
00:10:48.328 --> 00:10:49.454
Well, I don't know, Gemma.

206
00:10:49.537 --> 00:10:50.997
That's probably got
something to do


207
00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:52.499
with me becoming an asshole.

208
00:10:55.001 --> 00:10:56.336
Okay.

209
00:11:14.687 --> 00:11:15.939
Max!

210
00:11:16.022 --> 00:11:17.774
-Hello, how are you?
-How are you?


211
00:11:17.857 --> 00:11:20.026
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.


212
00:11:20.151 --> 00:11:22.612
I'm looking so much forward
to gloating through the room.


213
00:11:22.695 --> 00:11:25.532
Oh, well, follow me.

214
00:11:28.618 --> 00:11:30.912
-Danny, how are you?
-Congratulations.


215
00:11:31.037 --> 00:11:32.705
-Thank you. Austin.
-Max, congratulations.


216
00:11:32.831 --> 00:11:33.915
Say hello to your dad for me.

217
00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:35.875
Oh, love, mm.
How are you doing?


218
00:11:35.959 --> 00:11:37.585
-Very well. How are you?
-Oh, Lucy.


219
00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:40.004
-Hello.
-I didn't realize that you two knew each other.


220
00:11:40.088 --> 00:11:41.047
Whoops.

221
00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:43.424
He's adorable.

222
00:11:46.553 --> 00:11:48.805
Mm, magnificent bouquet.

223
00:11:48.888 --> 00:11:50.223
Alluring nose.

224
00:11:50.306 --> 00:11:51.349
Honey and spice.

225
00:11:51.474 --> 00:11:53.309
And all things nice.

226
00:11:53.393 --> 00:11:55.728
Inspection of the polyphenolics
reveals magnificent hues


227
00:11:55.812 --> 00:11:58.231
of brick red,
indicative of a mature Bordeaux.


228
00:11:58.356 --> 00:12:00.733
It's a burgundy.

229
00:12:02.318 --> 00:12:03.403
Yes, I knew it's burgundy.

230
00:12:03.528 --> 00:12:04.612
One for you, sir?

231
00:12:04.737 --> 00:12:08.074
I think I shall have an eclipse.

232
00:12:08.158 --> 00:12:09.450
-Thank you.
-Charles, can we get


233
00:12:09.576 --> 00:12:11.411
our minds off the double
frontage with the view


234
00:12:11.536 --> 00:12:12.787
and onto the French real estate?

235
00:12:12.912 --> 00:12:13.997
What do you think it's worth?

236
00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:15.999
Max, barely a day has passed
since you learned


237
00:12:16.082 --> 00:12:17.250
of the long-lost uncle's

238
00:12:17.375 --> 00:12:19.377
departure from this world,

239
00:12:19.502 --> 00:12:21.212
and all you can think of is money.

240
00:12:21.337 --> 00:12:22.964
The very same uncle you're
talking about, Charles, is


241
00:12:23.089 --> 00:12:24.924
the man who taught me every man
needs a fuck-you million.


242
00:12:25.008 --> 00:12:27.594
Okay, when are you gonna
furnish me with the particulars,


243
00:12:27.719 --> 00:12:29.012
because an estate agent
needs something


244
00:12:29.095 --> 00:12:30.096
he can sink his teeth into.

245
00:12:30.221 --> 00:12:32.765
Well, uh, it's been a while

246
00:12:32.891 --> 00:12:34.893
since I've been there,
but from memory,


247
00:12:35.018 --> 00:12:37.645
at least half a dozen
bedrooms, a pool, tennis...


248
00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:39.189
court, a decent-sized kitchen...

249
00:12:39.272 --> 00:12:42.275
-Thanks.
-11 hectares, a vineyard.


250
00:12:42.358 --> 00:12:45.069
Bloody hell, Max, it sounds
like an estate to me, a chÃ¢teau.


251
00:12:45.195 --> 00:12:47.447
What's a chÃ¢teau go for these days?

252
00:12:47.572 --> 00:12:50.200
Well, we're obviously in the
"F-You" department, aren't we?


253
00:12:50.283 --> 00:12:51.659
-Maybe several.
-Really?


254
00:12:51.784 --> 00:12:53.620
God bless Henry.

255
00:12:53.703 --> 00:12:54.746
I won't count my commission.

256
00:12:54.829 --> 00:12:56.080
I wouldn't expect you to, Charles.

257
00:12:56.206 --> 00:12:57.832
That's why I'm fond of you.

258
00:12:57.957 --> 00:12:59.876
Well, in that case, Max...

259
00:12:59.959 --> 00:13:02.670
here's to you.

260
00:13:33.326 --> 00:13:35.453
Gemma.

261
00:13:42.669 --> 00:13:44.546
<i>Parlez-vous anglais?</i>

262
00:13:58.309 --> 00:13:59.853
-Yeah?
-Kenny,


263
00:13:59.978 --> 00:14:01.646
I want the current ten-year yield,

264
00:14:01.771 --> 00:14:04.399
I want an update on the figures
for nonfarm payrolls,


265
00:14:04.524 --> 00:14:06.609
and I want you to get
your scrawny little backside


266
00:14:06.693 --> 00:14:07.861
out of my chair.

267
00:14:07.986 --> 00:14:10.488
Thank you.

268
00:14:11.447 --> 00:14:13.867
How'd he know that?

269
00:14:18.788 --> 00:14:20.915
Lance Armstrong!

270
00:14:38.308 --> 00:14:41.019
Maxie! Hi. How are you?

271
00:14:41.144 --> 00:14:42.562
Gemma, come on, love,
admit it: This is


272
00:14:42.687 --> 00:14:44.772
because I didn't shag you
at the Christmas party,


273
00:14:44.898 --> 00:14:46.524
-isn't it?
-Listen, I swear on my life,


274
00:14:46.649 --> 00:14:48.902
Max, they didn't have
any other cars.


275
00:14:50.236 --> 00:14:52.155
So, where are we, Max?

276
00:14:52.238 --> 00:14:54.782
Oh, for bollocky's sake!

277
00:14:54.908 --> 00:14:56.910
Right, I've gone
to the end of that road...


278
00:14:57.035 --> 00:14:59.120
Look, they're both the D-3.

279
00:14:59.245 --> 00:15:01.706
I've got Menerbes on my left,
or I've got Cavaillon on my right,


280
00:15:01.831 --> 00:15:03.666
and they're both on the D-3.

281
00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:05.543
-Go! Go!
-Oh... shut up!


282
00:15:05.668 --> 00:15:08.087
Okay, okay, hang on a minute.
I'll help you. Hang on.


283
00:15:08.213 --> 00:15:09.506
I've got a...
I've got a GPS here


284
00:15:09.589 --> 00:15:11.591
-Go! Go!
-With a stutter and a...


285
00:15:11.674 --> 00:15:13.718
quite frankly,
a shitty, froggy attitude!


286
00:15:15.261 --> 00:15:17.472
Okay, listen, you turn left
and that'll take you straight


287
00:15:17.597 --> 00:15:20.558
onto the N-7, and if you
really put your foot on it,


288
00:15:20.683 --> 00:15:23.770
you might even get
to your appointment on time.


289
00:15:26.856 --> 00:15:29.984
-Bollocks! Bugger!

290
00:15:32.195 --> 00:15:33.655
Mission control.

291
00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:35.573
All right, love, please reschedule

292
00:15:35.657 --> 00:15:37.158
my meeting with the notaire

293
00:15:37.283 --> 00:15:38.535
for first thing tomorrow morning.

294
00:15:38.618 --> 00:15:39.536
Okay.

295
00:15:39.619 --> 00:15:41.287
What about the keys, Max?

296
00:15:41.412 --> 00:15:43.623
-Oh, there used to be a stone, you know.
-Uh-huh.


297
00:15:43.748 --> 00:15:46.918
Uh, by the front door. Ask her to put that...
put the keys under the stone,


298
00:15:47.043 --> 00:15:48.962
and I'll, um,
I'll pick them up from there.


299
00:15:49.087 --> 00:15:51.131
Okay, copy that. Copy that.

300
00:16:12.485 --> 00:16:14.487
Huh.

301
00:17:08.875 --> 00:17:11.836
Hello?

302
00:17:13.296 --> 00:17:16.800
Henry?

303
00:19:03.573 --> 00:19:06.242
<i>Come on, you're slower than your Aunt Midge!</i>

304
00:19:07.827 --> 00:19:10.663
<i>
-That's it, Maximillian.</i>

305
00:19:10.788 --> 00:19:12.832
-It's not funny.

306
00:19:12.957 --> 00:19:15.210
What are you, a man or a mouse?

307
00:19:15.335 --> 00:19:17.670
Fine, then, I'm a mouse. 
Squeak, squeak!

308
00:19:32.644 --> 00:19:34.813
Hopeless, you're hopeless.

309
00:19:34.896 --> 00:19:36.356
Oh, stop it!

310
00:19:48.785 --> 00:19:51.621
Match point.

311
00:19:51.704 --> 00:19:53.039
Ace!

312
00:19:53.164 --> 00:19:54.707
Game! Set!

313
00:19:54.833 --> 00:19:57.085
-Match!
-You cannot be serious!


314
00:19:57.210 --> 00:19:58.461
-Hey.

315
00:19:58.545 --> 00:20:00.964
-You have to rub it in?
-Hey...


316
00:20:01.047 --> 00:20:03.049
The point is, Max, why
you aren't celebrating?


317
00:20:03.174 --> 00:20:04.634
Because I lost!

318
00:20:04.717 --> 00:20:06.636
Well, a man should acknowledge

319
00:20:06.719 --> 00:20:12.225
his losses just as gracefully
as he celebrates his victories.


320
00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:13.977
Come on, give us a jig.

321
00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:15.645
Give your old uncle a jig.

322
00:20:15.728 --> 00:20:16.855
-Oh, yeah, I lost.
-Arms and up and down.


323
00:20:16.938 --> 00:20:19.941
Yeah, great, yeah, I lost! I lost!

324
00:20:20.066 --> 00:20:21.192
-Uncle Henry won!
-Yes.


325
00:20:21.317 --> 00:20:23.278
-Three cheers!
-Dance, don't shimmy like an Italian.


326
00:20:23.403 --> 00:20:24.487
Well done, Uncle Henry.

327
00:20:24.571 --> 00:20:26.406
This is stupid.

328
00:20:26.531 --> 00:20:29.159
You'll come to see

329
00:20:29.242 --> 00:20:31.953
that a man learns
nothing from winning.


330
00:20:32.078 --> 00:20:35.415
The act of losing, however,
can elicit great wisdom.


331
00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:37.292
Not least of which is, uh,

332
00:20:37.417 --> 00:20:40.086
how much more enjoyable it is to win.

333
00:20:40.211 --> 00:20:43.256
It's inevitable to lose now and again.

334
00:20:43.381 --> 00:20:46.718
The trick is not
to make a habit of it.


335
00:20:46.801 --> 00:20:47.927
Drink?

336
00:21:09.282 --> 00:21:10.700
Chicken shit.

337
00:21:10.783 --> 00:21:12.327
-Excuse me?

338
00:21:12.452 --> 00:21:14.496
On the roses.

339
00:21:14.621 --> 00:21:16.873
Oh, fertilizer.

340
00:21:16.956 --> 00:21:18.666
Oh, Tati.

341
00:21:18.791 --> 00:21:20.710
Hello.

342
00:21:20.793 --> 00:21:22.128
Duflot?

343
00:21:22.253 --> 00:21:23.505
<i>Oui.</i>

344
00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:24.798
-Max.
-My God.


345
00:21:24.923 --> 00:21:27.842
Haven't you... matured.

346
00:21:27.967 --> 00:21:30.762
<i>Ah, c'est vrai,
the floods of'78,</i>


347
00:21:30.845 --> 00:21:33.473
-Right.
-Mistral of'86,


348
00:21:33.598 --> 00:21:35.225
-fanleaf disease in '93.

349
00:21:35.308 --> 00:21:36.810
-Fanleaf disease.
-In each vintage I've


350
00:21:36.935 --> 00:21:40.271
corked away another
year of my youth.


351
00:21:40.355 --> 00:21:41.981
But I still have my wife, Ludivine.

352
00:21:42.106 --> 00:21:43.399
-Ludivine.
-Yeah.


353
00:21:43.483 --> 00:21:45.652
<i>And my dog...
ah, voila, Tati.</i>


354
00:21:47.195 --> 00:21:48.488
I expect you're hungry, no?

355
00:21:48.613 --> 00:21:49.614
Please, come tonight.

356
00:21:49.739 --> 00:21:51.157
My wife is roasting a lamb-mmm!

357
00:21:51.282 --> 00:21:52.492
To tell the truth,

358
00:21:52.617 --> 00:21:54.202
I haven't had much of an appetite

359
00:21:54.327 --> 00:21:55.411
since I learned of Henry.

360
00:21:55.495 --> 00:21:58.581
Oh, the very last years,
his sight was failing.


361
00:21:58.665 --> 00:22:01.292
But I tended to things
for him, you know?


362
00:22:01.417 --> 00:22:03.753
We became very close.

363
00:22:03.837 --> 00:22:08.424
Almost like... father and son.

364
00:22:08.508 --> 00:22:11.845
Well, I am most appreciative

365
00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:13.263
that someone was here for him.

366
00:22:13.346 --> 00:22:15.348
Well, my wife will
come in the morning


367
00:22:15.473 --> 00:22:16.641
with croissants, okay?

368
00:22:16.724 --> 00:22:18.810
Huh? She will resume her duties.

369
00:22:18.935 --> 00:22:21.521
<i>-Allez! Bon!
-If you insist.</i>


370
00:22:33.825 --> 00:22:35.827
Hmm.

371
00:22:37.537 --> 00:22:39.664
"Welcome. "

372
00:22:41.374 --> 00:22:43.168
Ah.

373
00:22:43.251 --> 00:22:46.129
Don't mind if I do.

374
00:22:52.218 --> 00:22:53.970
Here's to you, Henry.

375
00:22:54.053 --> 00:22:57.682
Devoting your life to the vines...

376
00:22:57.807 --> 00:23:00.018
and bottling the truth.

377
00:23:05.356 --> 00:23:07.484
Hmm...

378
00:23:11.654 --> 00:23:13.490
That was honest.

379
00:23:13.573 --> 00:23:17.994
Jesus, ought to have
a poison sticker on it.


380
00:23:25.251 --> 00:23:27.587
Ah... coffee, coffee.

381
00:23:28.713 --> 00:23:30.507
What's in here?

382
00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:32.926
And that?

383
00:23:33.885 --> 00:23:35.512
Piss off.

384
00:23:40.099 --> 00:23:41.309
Hmm.

385
00:23:41.434 --> 00:23:44.020
Morning, Henry.

386
00:23:44.103 --> 00:23:46.940
Milk.

387
00:23:49.192 --> 00:23:51.027
Hmm.

388
00:23:58.243 --> 00:23:59.619
Maxie!

389
00:23:59.744 --> 00:24:00.662
Madame Duflot!

390
00:24:00.787 --> 00:24:02.622
Maxie! Maxie! Maxie!

391
00:24:07.085 --> 00:24:09.254
-Oh...
-Morning.


392
00:24:25.228 --> 00:24:26.646
Morning, Gemma.

393
00:24:26.729 --> 00:24:28.898
Are you enjoying yourself, Max?

394
00:24:28.982 --> 00:24:30.984
Oh, yes, as bereavements go, you know.

395
00:24:31.067 --> 00:24:32.485
This will cheer you up.

396
00:24:32.569 --> 00:24:33.862
You've been busted.

397
00:24:33.987 --> 00:24:36.823
<i>Morning Financial Times headline:</i>

398
00:24:36.906 --> 00:24:39.534
"Lorden Brothers trade
under investigation. "


399
00:24:39.659 --> 00:24:41.953
You don't have to worry
about any of that.


400
00:24:42.036 --> 00:24:44.414
The FSA today launched
an official inquiry


401
00:24:44.497 --> 00:24:47.500
into recent Lorden Brothers
trade activity.


402
00:24:47.625 --> 00:24:49.502
Yes, well, I double-checked
it all through Legal.


403
00:24:49.627 --> 00:24:51.379
I covered our asses, okay?

404
00:24:51.504 --> 00:24:53.756
It's just bollocks to placate
the lucid back.


405
00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:55.383
Oh, he doesn't think so.

406
00:24:55.508 --> 00:24:59.387
-Nigel?
-Sir Nigel.


407
00:24:59.512 --> 00:25:02.640
He wants a meeting with you today,

408
00:25:02.724 --> 00:25:05.018
Well, it must be
about something else.


409
00:25:05.143 --> 00:25:06.811
Um, what time is my meeting
with the notaire?


410
00:25:06.895 --> 00:25:08.771
A little over an hour from now.

411
00:25:08.855 --> 00:25:10.190
My time or yours?

412
00:25:10.273 --> 00:25:11.649
Oh, shit.

413
00:25:11.733 --> 00:25:13.485
Oh, Gemma!

414
00:25:42.555 --> 00:25:43.848
Yes?

415
00:25:43.932 --> 00:25:45.683
How's the house, Max?
Is it gorgeous?


416
00:25:45.767 --> 00:25:47.560
Well, to tell you
the truth, Charlie,


417
00:25:47.685 --> 00:25:48.812
it's a little bit shabby.

418
00:25:48.895 --> 00:25:49.979
We don't say shabby, Max.

419
00:25:50.063 --> 00:25:52.190
We say filled with the patina
of a bygone era.


420
00:25:52.273 --> 00:25:54.275
-How's the wine?
-Right.


421
00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:55.902
Uh, bouquet of a wet dog.

422
00:25:56.027 --> 00:25:57.862
Hits the palate like a razor blade

423
00:25:57.946 --> 00:26:00.073
with a finish that hints of awful.

424
00:26:00.198 --> 00:26:01.449
So the house is falling apart

425
00:26:01.574 --> 00:26:02.867
and the vineyard
makes undrinkable wine?


426
00:26:02.951 --> 00:26:04.160
Excellent.

427
00:26:04.244 --> 00:26:06.496
One thing you are going
to need is an oenologue.


428
00:26:06.579 --> 00:26:07.747
All right, what's that?

429
00:26:07.872 --> 00:26:09.499
It's a sort of licensed wine expert.

430
00:26:09.582 --> 00:26:11.876
They take soil samples-bits of
the vine, that sort of thing-


431
00:26:12.001 --> 00:26:14.045
tests them-there must
be a couple near you.


432
00:26:14.170 --> 00:26:16.214
And also, I would need
a couple of sexy snaps


433
00:26:16.297 --> 00:26:17.632
to get the punters clamoring,

434
00:26:17.757 --> 00:26:20.844
and I have an e-mail address for
you to send them to, which is...


435
00:26:20.927 --> 00:26:23.346
Hold on a second.
I'll just put you on speaker.


436
00:26:23.429 --> 00:26:24.430
Okay, shoot.

437
00:26:24.514 --> 00:26:25.431

<i>-Hello?
-Attention!</i>


441
00:26:34.607 --> 00:26:36.109
-Hello?
-Shit.


442
00:26:38.027 --> 00:26:40.488
-Max?
-All right, go on.


443
00:27:07.223 --> 00:27:08.266
Auzet.

444
00:27:11.186 --> 00:27:12.604
Hello.

445
00:27:12.729 --> 00:27:14.522
Max Skinner.

446
00:27:14.606 --> 00:27:17.650
The vigneron makes the wine

447
00:27:17.734 --> 00:27:21.446
and the estate owner
maintains the property.


448
00:27:21.571 --> 00:27:22.447
Mr. Skinner?

449
00:27:22.572 --> 00:27:25.116
Yes, hmm, right, well, delightful.

450
00:27:25.241 --> 00:27:28.161
This is how your uncle
and Monsieur Duflot


451
00:27:28.244 --> 00:27:30.580
worked for over 20 years.

452
00:27:30.663 --> 00:27:31.873
Naturally, Monsieur Duflot

453
00:27:31.956 --> 00:27:34.250
will be anxious
as to your intentions.


454
00:27:34.334 --> 00:27:37.086
I think I can speed this up.

455
00:27:37.212 --> 00:27:40.381
I have no intention
of becoming a winemaker.


456
00:27:40.465 --> 00:27:44.803
So let Monsieur Duflot
make the wine


457
00:27:44.928 --> 00:27:47.096
and you enjoy the estate
on the weekends.


458
00:27:47.222 --> 00:27:49.057
I'm not sure you understand me.

459
00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:50.850
My life is in London.

460
00:27:50.934 --> 00:27:52.519
I don't do weekends.

461
00:27:52.602 --> 00:27:54.270
I intend to sell La Siroque

462
00:27:54.395 --> 00:27:55.772
as soon as possible.

463
00:27:55.855 --> 00:27:57.190
And what about, uh,

464
00:27:57.273 --> 00:27:59.108
Monsieur and Madame Duflot?

465
00:27:59.192 --> 00:28:00.944
Look, in all cases like this,
it simply


466
00:28:01.069 --> 00:28:02.278
just comes down to a figure.

467
00:28:02.403 --> 00:28:05.156
Well, if there's nothing else,
I have a plane to catch.


468
00:28:05.281 --> 00:28:07.450
Right.

469
00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:26.302
You're selling La Siroque?

470
00:28:26.386 --> 00:28:28.179
There has been a mistake, I think.

471
00:28:28.304 --> 00:28:29.681
News travels fast.

472
00:28:31.141 --> 00:28:32.559
But your uncle,

473
00:28:32.642 --> 00:28:34.519
he meant for you to have it,

474
00:28:34.644 --> 00:28:35.520
not sell it.

475
00:28:35.645 --> 00:28:36.813
Well, I'm sure if he did,

476
00:28:36.938 --> 00:28:38.815
he would have written
that down in a proper will.


477
00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:40.150
He didn't.

478
00:28:40.233 --> 00:28:42.610
You know, Henry was not
English the way you are.


479
00:28:42.694 --> 00:28:45.155
He was a man of secrets,
a man of passion.


480
00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:46.739
He didn't write things down.

481
00:28:46.823 --> 00:28:48.992
You would take me
away from my vines?


482
00:28:49.117 --> 00:28:51.494
My vines, Duflot.

483
00:28:51.619 --> 00:28:53.454
I live in them,

484
00:28:53.538 --> 00:28:54.706
I breathe in them.

485
00:28:54.831 --> 00:28:56.583
They tear my hands.

486
00:28:56.666 --> 00:28:59.169
Look, Francis, when
I sell the property,


487
00:28:59.252 --> 00:29:02.255
I do intend to make you
a handsome settlement.


488
00:29:02.338 --> 00:29:05.091
Do you know, monsieur,
what it is to love something


489
00:29:05.175 --> 00:29:07.594
more than your own life?

490
00:29:07.677 --> 00:29:10.805
To submit your days and nights
to the fickle will of nature?


491
00:29:10.930 --> 00:29:12.849
I have only a few vintages left.

492
00:29:12.974 --> 00:29:16.561
<i>Soon my body and spirit will
be defeated by the terroir.</i>


493
00:29:16.686 --> 00:29:18.771
And you would dare come
here and take away


494
00:29:18.855 --> 00:29:20.231
my last few chances of immortality?

495
00:29:20.356 --> 00:29:23.401
Afraid so. Be in touch.

496
00:29:32.744 --> 00:29:34.245
Leaving now.

497
00:29:34.370 --> 00:29:35.663
Oh, good.

498
00:29:35.747 --> 00:29:37.957
'Cause Sir Nigel has made
a special trip, Max.


499
00:29:38.041 --> 00:29:39.959
-Is everything okay?
-Everything's fine.


500
00:29:40.043 --> 00:29:42.629
Good. Oh, did you remember
to take photos for Charlie?


501
00:29:42.712 --> 00:29:43.797
Yes.

502
00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:45.590
-Damn it!

503
00:29:45.715 --> 00:29:47.592
Idiot.

504
00:30:40.019 --> 00:30:43.565
Let's see you then.

505
00:30:43.690 --> 00:30:44.774
One... two...

506
00:30:44.899 --> 00:30:46.484
...and go!

507
00:31:09.382 --> 00:31:11.217
-Yes?
-Get in the car.


508
00:31:11.301 --> 00:31:13.845
Get off my camera.

509
00:31:19.476 --> 00:31:21.311
-Bollocks!

510
00:31:40.830 --> 00:31:44.292
Oh, come on!
Where's the ladder?


511
00:31:44.417 --> 00:31:47.670
Where are you, tosser?

512
00:32:32.382 --> 00:32:34.217
-Hold on!

513
00:32:36.177 --> 00:32:38.555
Come to Papa. Come to Papa.

514
00:32:44.727 --> 00:32:49.357
Gemma, for God's sake, keep calling!

515
00:33:03.663 --> 00:33:05.707
Hello.

516
00:33:05.790 --> 00:33:07.834
Oh, no, don't worry about me.

517
00:33:07.917 --> 00:33:09.335
I'm... I'm the pool man.

518
00:33:09.419 --> 00:33:11.379
I do this every Thursday.

519
00:33:11.463 --> 00:33:13.047
It's just routine maintenance.

520
00:33:15.425 --> 00:33:18.595
It's been lovely chatting to you.

521
00:33:23.850 --> 00:33:27.562
And, and you are
a spectacular vision.


522
00:33:28.980 --> 00:33:31.274
But any chance for a rope
or a ladder?


523
00:33:31.357 --> 00:33:34.527
Is that your little car?

524
00:33:34.611 --> 00:33:36.738
Uh, yes, I'm the temporary custodian

525
00:33:36.821 --> 00:33:38.698
of the lime green roller skate,

526
00:33:38.781 --> 00:33:40.366
but it's a hired car; it's a rental.

527
00:33:40.450 --> 00:33:41.242
It's not for sale. Sorry?

528
00:33:41.326 --> 00:33:42.660
-Can you swim?
-Well, yes, but...


529
00:33:42.785 --> 00:33:43.912
but not in a foot of cow shit.

530
00:33:48.917 --> 00:33:50.376
Hello?

531
00:33:58.718 --> 00:34:01.095
Will all passengers on Flight...

532
00:34:03.223 --> 00:34:06.726
He's not on the flight.

533
00:34:06.851 --> 00:34:08.353
Right, right.

534
00:34:08.436 --> 00:34:11.648
Okay, roger that.

535
00:34:37.215 --> 00:34:39.425
What is it, Major Lawrence,

536
00:34:39.509 --> 00:34:43.555
that attracts you, personally,
to the desert?


537
00:34:45.098 --> 00:34:46.349
It's clean.

538
00:34:46.432 --> 00:34:49.435
I like it because it's clean.

539
00:35:11.541 --> 00:35:13.334
Great.

540
00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:33.062
You better be in prison, Maxie.

541
00:35:33.146 --> 00:35:34.564
Yes, just tell him I'm sorry.

542
00:35:34.647 --> 00:35:36.357
There was nothing
I could do about it.


543
00:35:36.483 --> 00:35:38.651
Sorry's no good, Max.
He's gone.


544
00:35:38.776 --> 00:35:40.153
Oh, shit.

545
00:35:40.278 --> 00:35:43.573
Um, what time is the first
flight out in the morning?


546
00:35:43.656 --> 00:35:45.992
Oh, there's no point
in rushing back, Max.


547
00:35:46.117 --> 00:35:49.120
You know, the last thing
Sir Nigel did on his way out


548
00:35:49.245 --> 00:35:52.123
-was to suspend you for a week.
-What?


549
00:35:52.207 --> 00:35:54.918
What the f-does he expect me
to do for a week?


550
00:35:55.001 --> 00:35:56.503
Take a holiday?

551
00:35:56.628 --> 00:35:58.171
Christ, he didn't say that, did he?

552
00:35:58.296 --> 00:35:59.339
No, I just did.

553
00:35:59.464 --> 00:36:01.132
Right, Gemma. Never say that.

554
00:36:01.216 --> 00:36:02.467
If anybody calls,

555
00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:04.511
do not say I'm on holiday.

556
00:36:04.636 --> 00:36:06.054
All right?
That's worse than dying.


557
00:36:06.179 --> 00:36:07.472
Now, look.

558
00:36:07.555 --> 00:36:09.682
I'll be back in the office
in a couple of days.


559
00:36:09.808 --> 00:36:10.809
-You just make sure
-Okay.


560
00:36:10.892 --> 00:36:12.894
That every man jack
in there is ready.


561
00:36:13.019 --> 00:36:15.021
Set it up so I can
trade in Kenny's name.


562
00:36:15.146 --> 00:36:16.147
What?

563
00:36:16.272 --> 00:36:18.316
Get him a clearance
at the highest level


564
00:36:18.399 --> 00:36:19.984
on Sir Nigel's recommend.

565
00:36:20.109 --> 00:36:21.069
Are you mad, Max?

566
00:36:21.194 --> 00:36:22.237
Who cares? Just do it.

567
00:36:22.362 --> 00:36:23.363
Don't tell anybody, all right?

568
00:36:23.488 --> 00:36:25.865
Especially not that
little shit, Kenny.


569
00:36:25.990 --> 00:36:27.700
Max, is there a problem?

570
00:36:27.826 --> 00:36:29.702
No, I'm having a great time.

571
00:36:29.828 --> 00:36:30.870
-You sure?
-Yes.


572
00:36:30.995 --> 00:36:33.123
-You just be careful, okay? Okay. Ciao.
-Okay.


573
00:36:33.206 --> 00:36:35.125
Bye.

574
00:37:32.348 --> 00:37:33.975
-Oh, shit!

575
00:37:34.058 --> 00:37:37.020
Shit! Scorpion! Scorpion!
Ludivine!


576
00:37:38.563 --> 00:37:39.647
Scorpion!

577
00:37:39.772 --> 00:37:42.567
-Oh! Drop it! Bloody hell!

578
00:37:42.650 --> 00:37:44.944
Get that little bastard!

579
00:37:47.322 --> 00:37:48.865
Of course.

580
00:37:48.990 --> 00:37:50.241
Okay.

581
00:38:13.223 --> 00:38:14.849
Fits very well; beautifully.

582
00:38:14.974 --> 00:38:16.518
Max?

583
00:38:16.643 --> 00:38:18.353
Are you back in Blighty?

584
00:38:18.436 --> 00:38:19.729
On the contrary, chuckles.

585
00:38:19.854 --> 00:38:23.399
I've decided to stick around
for a couple of days.


586
00:38:23.525 --> 00:38:25.485
So it's true,
you are getting the sack.


587
00:38:25.568 --> 00:38:27.403
No, I'm not getting
the sack, Charlie.


588
00:38:27.529 --> 00:38:30.240
I'm just exploring my options,
with a view to realizing


589
00:38:30.365 --> 00:38:32.325
the full potential
of my inheritance.


590
00:38:32.408 --> 00:38:33.660
Well, speaking
of your inheritance,


591
00:38:33.743 --> 00:38:35.078
how soon before we can view?

592
00:38:35.203 --> 00:38:36.538
It's cosmetic stuff mostly, I'd say.

593
00:38:36.621 --> 00:38:39.666
Surprising, actually,
how well it's been maintained.


594
00:38:39.791 --> 00:38:41.042
Hmm. So you don't need

595
00:38:41.126 --> 00:38:42.585
a contractor or anything like that?

596
00:38:42.710 --> 00:38:44.671
Uh, no, no, no, no.
Just needs a...


597
00:38:44.754 --> 00:38:47.382
a coat of paint
and a bit of a scrub.


598
00:38:47.507 --> 00:38:48.591
Okay, you sure?

599
00:38:48.716 --> 00:38:51.553
-No problem at all, Charlie.
-Good.


600
00:38:51.636 --> 00:38:54.097
Charlie?

601
00:38:54.222 --> 00:38:56.766
Charlie, can you hear me?

602
00:38:56.891 --> 00:38:57.934
-Yes.

603
00:38:58.059 --> 00:38:59.018
Can you hear me now?

604
00:38:59.144 --> 00:39:01.563
-Yes.
-Look, I wasn't joking before


605
00:39:01.646 --> 00:39:03.773
about what I said
about the wine they make here.


606
00:39:03.898 --> 00:39:08.027
It is not, I repeat,
not first-class.


607
00:39:08.111 --> 00:39:10.905
-Will that affect our price?
-Well, how bad can it be?


608
00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:12.740
Uh, well,
it gives you a blinding headache


609
00:39:12.824 --> 00:39:14.075
-and it makes you angry.
-Ah.


610
00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:16.911
I can't imagine the damage
a second sip might do.


611
00:39:16.995 --> 00:39:18.746
Well, we'll just have to make sure

612
00:39:18.830 --> 00:39:20.582
our buyers don't know
anything about wine.


613
00:39:20.665 --> 00:39:22.000
We'll concentrate on the Americans.

614
00:39:23.751 --> 00:39:26.254
Just make sure she's match-fit
in 72 hours.


615
00:39:26.379 --> 00:39:27.839
72 hours.

616
00:39:27.922 --> 00:39:29.257
Righto.

617
00:39:32.677 --> 00:39:34.095
A Lamborghini tractor.

618
00:39:34.220 --> 00:39:35.430
<i>Paintbrush...</i>

619
00:39:35.513 --> 00:39:36.764
paintbrush, paintbrush.

620
00:39:40.727 --> 00:39:42.687
Paintbrush!

621
00:39:57.035 --> 00:39:58.036
You old bugger.

622
00:40:27.690 --> 00:40:29.859
Duflot.

623
00:40:31.945 --> 00:40:35.365
I was just about to use
that paintbrush.


624
00:40:35.490 --> 00:40:36.783
It's my paintbrush.

625
00:40:36.866 --> 00:40:38.159
Gee whiz.

626
00:40:38.284 --> 00:40:39.536
This is fun.

627
00:40:39.661 --> 00:40:41.454
Tell you what,

628
00:40:41.538 --> 00:40:44.165
I'll give you 20 euros
for your paintbrush.


629
00:40:44.290 --> 00:40:45.416
-Hmm?
-No.


630
00:40:45.542 --> 00:40:46.501
No?

631
00:40:46.626 --> 00:40:48.002
Fifty.

632
00:40:48.086 --> 00:40:50.630
I'll give you a hundred euros
for your paintbrush, Duflot.


633
00:40:50.755 --> 00:40:52.382
I don't care.
What do you want?


634
00:40:55.635 --> 00:40:57.512
When you sell, 
I stay vigneron.

635
00:40:57.595 --> 00:40:59.139
I keep my vines.

636
00:40:59.264 --> 00:41:00.306
You want to stay with your vines?

637
00:41:00.390 --> 00:41:01.641
-Mm-hmm.
-Fine.


638
00:41:01.724 --> 00:41:03.017
That means you...

639
00:41:03.101 --> 00:41:05.395
must help me... fix the place up-

640
00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:06.771
do the gardens,

641
00:41:06.855 --> 00:41:09.357
paint the house,
clean the pool-and I,


642
00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:11.442
if at all possible,
will attempt to convince


643
00:41:11.568 --> 00:41:13.528
the new owners
of the worth and value


644
00:41:13.653 --> 00:41:15.029
of your services.

645

<i>D'accord?</i>

646
00:41:17.907 --> 00:41:19.159
A Frenchman's hand

647
00:41:19.242 --> 00:41:21.494
is his word.

648
00:41:22.704 --> 00:41:25.373
An Englishman's word is his bond.

<i>-Concord?
-Deal.</i>

00:41:30.211 --> 00:41:31.171
English prick.

652
00:41:50.356 --> 00:41:51.441
No.

653
00:42:28.353 --> 00:42:30.271
Awfully sorry.

654
00:42:32.232 --> 00:42:34.442
Goal of the day.

655
00:42:51.084 --> 00:42:53.837
Bat. Come on.

656
00:42:53.962 --> 00:42:55.463
Here comes the ball!

657
00:42:57.215 --> 00:42:58.675
Champion of the over-unh!

658
00:43:00.093 --> 00:43:02.679
Let's play.

659
00:43:02.804 --> 00:43:04.347
Come on.

660
00:43:06.558 --> 00:43:09.602
All right, I'm 12-none out.

661
00:43:11.855 --> 00:43:12.814
Okay.

662
00:43:19.070 --> 00:43:20.488
It won't last one month.

663
00:43:20.613 --> 00:43:22.866
If things go
according to plan, Francis,


664
00:43:22.991 --> 00:43:25.326
it will be somebody else's problem.

665
00:43:28.246 --> 00:43:30.290
Monsieur Max!

666
00:43:30.373 --> 00:43:31.458
Yes?

667
00:43:31.541 --> 00:43:35.503
There is, um... a person

668
00:43:35.587 --> 00:43:37.297
-at the door.
-A person?


669
00:43:37.422 --> 00:43:38.506
A person.

670
00:43:42.469 --> 00:43:44.137
<i>Bonjour.</i>

671
00:43:44.262 --> 00:43:45.430
<i>Bonjour.</i>

672
00:43:48.558 --> 00:43:51.311
The only country that issues
teeth like that is America.


673
00:43:51.436 --> 00:43:52.562
Oh.

674
00:43:52.687 --> 00:43:53.730
You speak English.

675
00:43:53.855 --> 00:43:55.273
-Like a native.

676
00:43:55.356 --> 00:43:57.025
I'm Christie Roberts.

677
00:43:57.150 --> 00:43:59.027
I'm looking for Mr. Skinner.

678
00:43:59.152 --> 00:44:01.654
You lucky devil, you found him.

679
00:44:01.779 --> 00:44:03.198
Impossible.

680
00:44:03.323 --> 00:44:05.325
You're way too young.

681
00:44:05.450 --> 00:44:08.745
You know, I was just thinking
the same thing about you.


682
00:44:08.870 --> 00:44:11.122
I meant too young to be my dad.

683
00:44:13.249 --> 00:44:15.794
Henry Skinner is my father.

684
00:44:18.004 --> 00:44:19.339
She has Henry's nose.

685
00:44:19.464 --> 00:44:20.465
<i>Allez. Allez.</i>

686
00:44:23.426 --> 00:44:25.178
Wow.

687
00:44:27.847 --> 00:44:29.682
This your mum?

688
00:44:29.808 --> 00:44:31.100
<i>In all her Flashdance glory.</i>

689
00:44:33.394 --> 00:44:35.688
So, uh...

690
00:44:35.814 --> 00:44:37.357
is he around?

691
00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:40.527
Oh, bollocks.

692
00:44:40.610 --> 00:44:41.694
Um...

693
00:44:44.989 --> 00:44:46.407
I'm sorry.
I've forgotten your name.


694
00:44:46.533 --> 00:44:48.409
-It's Christie.
-Christie.


695
00:44:48.535 --> 00:44:51.371
You see, Christie, um...

696
00:44:51.454 --> 00:44:53.498
Henry...

697
00:44:55.250 --> 00:44:57.293
He's dead, huh?

698
00:44:57.418 --> 00:44:59.212
A month ago.

699
00:45:02.799 --> 00:45:04.926
Um...

700
00:45:06.177 --> 00:45:07.720
Cup of tea?

701
00:45:07.804 --> 00:45:09.556
Yes?

702
00:45:09.639 --> 00:45:11.099
Madame Duflot.

703
00:45:12.809 --> 00:45:14.185
Well, no, it's more
than a wrinkle, Max.


704
00:45:14.269 --> 00:45:15.728
What if the girl
turns out to be legit?


705
00:45:15.812 --> 00:45:16.896
Oh, come on, she turns up

706
00:45:16.980 --> 00:45:18.731
a couple months after he parks it?

707
00:45:18.815 --> 00:45:20.483
Far too sweet, Charlie;
I'm not buying it.


708
00:45:20.608 --> 00:45:21.776
You need some legal advice, mate,

709
00:45:21.901 --> 00:45:23.736
and you need it fast,
in case the little minx


710
00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:25.530
screws up the whole deal.

711
00:45:25.613 --> 00:45:26.906
Asking price?

712
00:45:27.031 --> 00:45:28.533
Uh, it's seven and a half.

713
00:45:28.616 --> 00:45:30.034
Did you get that?

714
00:45:30.118 --> 00:45:33.121
Right.

715
00:45:36.833 --> 00:45:39.794
Christie, I'm just going
to pop into town.


716
00:45:39.919 --> 00:45:41.963
Oh, no problem-
I booked a youth hostel,


717
00:45:42.088 --> 00:45:43.256
just in case the old man

718
00:45:43.381 --> 00:45:44.716
-was schizo, you know?
-Oh, right.


719
00:45:44.799 --> 00:45:46.759
Oh, you mind dropping me off?

720
00:45:46.843 --> 00:45:50.430
I really got to get
out of these clothes.


721
00:45:50.555 --> 00:45:52.515
Why don't you just get
out of your clothes here?


722
00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:54.851
Got plenty of space, lots of room.

723
00:45:54.976 --> 00:45:56.269
You can clean up, take a shower.

724
00:45:56.352 --> 00:45:58.354
-I'll be back in a jiff.
-You sure?


725
00:45:58.480 --> 00:46:00.440
Absolutely, absolutely.

726
00:46:00.523 --> 00:46:02.358
Madame Duflot?

727
00:46:02.484 --> 00:46:04.444
<i>Voila.</i>

728
00:46:07.655 --> 00:46:10.783
In the French law,
there is no difference between

729
00:46:10.909 --> 00:46:13.703
legitimate and illegitimate
children when it comes


730
00:46:13.828 --> 00:46:16.122
to their right to inherit.

731
00:46:16.206 --> 00:46:17.582
That's bloody ridiculous.

732
00:46:17.665 --> 00:46:19.250
She never even met Henry.

733
00:46:19.334 --> 00:46:20.960
She could very well be an impostor.

734
00:46:21.044 --> 00:46:23.379
That is precisely why
she would be required


735
00:46:23.505 --> 00:46:24.798
to produce some form

736
00:46:24.881 --> 00:46:26.633
of documentation.

737
00:46:26.758 --> 00:46:28.092
Photo or even

738
00:46:28.176 --> 00:46:30.678
correspondence-a love letter.

739
00:46:30.804 --> 00:46:34.349
Yes, yes, yes, but what if I just...
sell the property


740
00:46:34.474 --> 00:46:37.143
before she even makes her claim?

741
00:46:37.227 --> 00:46:41.147
No; legally, she could
invalidate the sale


742
00:46:41.231 --> 00:46:42.982
even after the transfer of title.

743
00:46:43.107 --> 00:46:44.359
Bugger.

744
00:46:44.484 --> 00:46:46.027
My advice, Mr. Skinner,

745
00:46:46.152 --> 00:46:48.363
is to treat her
with the utmost respect.


746
00:46:48.488 --> 00:46:50.156
Goes without saying.

747
00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:52.700
And hope she'll be on her way.

748
00:46:52.826 --> 00:46:54.494
...bugger off.

749
00:46:54.619 --> 00:46:57.789
Don't let this... end in court.

750
00:47:16.933 --> 00:47:19.018
<i>Merci.</i>

751
00:47:31.531 --> 00:47:32.657
Joan of Arc?

752
00:47:33.741 --> 00:47:37.245
Oh, Jacques Cousteau.

753
00:47:37.370 --> 00:47:39.038
You tried to drown me.

754
00:47:39.122 --> 00:47:41.166
And you tried to run me
over with your little car.


755
00:47:41.249 --> 00:47:43.460
What are you talking about,
I tried to run you over?


756
00:47:43.585 --> 00:47:44.377
What sort of bollocks is that?

757
00:47:44.461 --> 00:47:46.004
Down the road from La Siroque,

758
00:47:46.087 --> 00:47:48.214
you were driving your
midget car on your phone.


759
00:47:49.299 --> 00:47:51.009
<i>Bonjour. Bonjour.</i>

760
00:47:51.092 --> 00:47:52.427
And I believe

761
00:47:52.552 --> 00:47:54.512
had your head stuck
very far up your ass.


762
00:47:54.596 --> 00:47:57.265
Look at the damage
you have caused me!


763
00:47:57.390 --> 00:47:59.017
You tried to kill me,

764
00:47:59.100 --> 00:48:00.768
I tried to kill you.

765
00:48:05.398 --> 00:48:07.692
My God.

766
00:48:07.775 --> 00:48:09.861
She's fantastic.

767
00:48:14.991 --> 00:48:17.243
Hey, Max.

768
00:48:17.368 --> 00:48:18.912
Look at the view.

769
00:48:18.995 --> 00:48:20.121
It's like CÃ©zanne.

770
00:48:37.889 --> 00:48:39.140
Oh, Tati. Psst.

771
00:48:44.312 --> 00:48:45.772
Francis...

772
00:48:45.855 --> 00:48:49.067
in, uh, in town today,

773
00:48:49.150 --> 00:48:51.653
I was, um,

774
00:48:51.736 --> 00:48:53.154
I was passing by this restaurant...

775
00:48:53.279 --> 00:48:54.948
Her name is Fanny Chenal.

776
00:48:56.533 --> 00:48:57.450
Right.

777
00:48:57.534 --> 00:48:58.618
Many times, I've seen

778
00:48:58.743 --> 00:49:01.454
this same look on your uncle's face.

779
00:49:01.538 --> 00:49:03.248
But you deserve credit.

780
00:49:03.331 --> 00:49:04.791
Why is that?

781
00:49:04.874 --> 00:49:07.127
You are now the town hero
for making her show


782
00:49:07.252 --> 00:49:08.795
her derriere.

783
00:49:13.174 --> 00:49:16.261
She, um...
She grew up around here, didn't she?


784
00:49:16.344 --> 00:49:17.637
Who?

785
00:49:17.762 --> 00:49:20.140
Fanny Chenal.

786
00:49:20.223 --> 00:49:22.308
I believe, yes.

787
00:49:22.433 --> 00:49:24.352
She, um...

788
00:49:26.396 --> 00:49:28.148
She otherwise spoken for?

789
00:49:28.273 --> 00:49:30.441
She was once.

790
00:49:30.525 --> 00:49:33.236
A football player-for Lyon.

791
00:49:33.361 --> 00:49:34.445
He was shit,

792
00:49:34.529 --> 00:49:36.072
just like his left foot.

793
00:49:36.197 --> 00:49:38.450
He treated her very badly, you know.

794
00:49:38.533 --> 00:49:41.327
Since then, it's rumored
that she will let no man


795
00:49:41.453 --> 00:49:42.996
near her heart.

796
00:49:54.007 --> 00:49:55.425
So she's alone, then.

797
00:49:56.718 --> 00:49:58.219
Who?

798
00:49:58.344 --> 00:49:59.971
Fanny Chenal.

799
00:50:00.054 --> 00:50:01.014
Max,

800
00:50:01.097 --> 00:50:02.849
recall what Proust said:

801
00:50:02.974 --> 00:50:04.476
"Leave pretty women

802
00:50:04.601 --> 00:50:06.227
to men without imagination. "

803
00:50:06.394 --> 00:50:07.687
Duflot, I'm a banker.

804
00:50:09.189 --> 00:50:11.065
I have no imagination.

805
00:50:11.191 --> 00:50:12.984
Stop.

806
00:50:17.322 --> 00:50:18.823
Fred Perry.

807
00:50:20.909 --> 00:50:22.660
Henri Lacoste.

808
00:50:36.633 --> 00:50:37.592
Love-15.

809
00:50:42.764 --> 00:50:43.807
15-all.

810
00:50:47.435 --> 00:50:48.853
Yes!

811
00:50:51.731 --> 00:50:53.441
No, no, out.

812
00:50:53.566 --> 00:50:55.151
Cannot be serious!
That was in by a mile!


813
00:50:56.110 --> 00:50:57.862
Ball. Ball!

814
00:51:01.699 --> 00:51:02.367
Ah, good.

815
00:51:06.329 --> 00:51:07.497
-Yeah! Hey!

816
00:51:09.624 --> 00:51:10.917
Oh... oh, bollocks!

817
00:51:29.435 --> 00:51:30.728
My point.
