THIS FILM IS BASED ON A TRUE STORY

4
00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:32.020
IN MEMORY OF LISA, 
MARTIN AND CORALIE

5
00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.630
- Yes, hello.
- Hello.


6
00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.320
I heard back from the Public Curator,
and there's nothing we can do.


7
00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.070
You can't invest the girl's inheritance
in an income property.


8
00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.990
As the estate's only trustee,

9
00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.540
you enter into
a certain category of investor.


10
00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.960
They don't think real estate
is safe enough.


11
00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:37.670
Not safe enough?

12
00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:41.710
An income property
is the best possible investment.


13
00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.300
If you maintain it properly,
it never loses value.


14
00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.970
Sure, but you're not a young man anymore.

15
00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:51.850
There's always a risk.

16
00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.060
It's $190,000, Mr. Trudel.

17
00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.070
The state wants to ensure the inheritance
is safe and can yield a profit.


18
00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.900
Anyway…

19
00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:06.200
a financial investment
won't mean anything to Léa.


20
00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:12.660
I'm as disappointed as you are,
but the authorities won't budge.


21
00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.790
If I were you,
I'd invest in a fund,


22
00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:22.210
a stable, trustworthy investment fund
with a strong return.


23
00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:28.090
Hang on. I might have something for you.

24
00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:42.570
<i>The fund was created to ensure</i>

25
00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.820
that savings stay in Quebec,
in funds managed here.


26
00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.780
There's even a component
called the Quebec Fund


27
00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.870
that invests exclusively
in local businesses.


28
00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:56.790
Also, the fund is managed
by the Caisse de dépôt et placement,


29
00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.540
so it's 100% safe.

30
00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.040
I think it's the best option.

31
00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.920
To consolidate your savings
and reduce management fees,


32
00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.630
I'd strongly recommend it.

33
00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:07.930
Wait until you see the historical returns.

34
00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:24.860
EVOLUTION FUND

35
00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:11.660
What's his story?

36
00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:14.120
He worked at the Caisse
for a couple years.


37
00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.990
$500,000 in Maxima Capital?

38
00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.250
MONTREAL, SUMMER 2001

39
00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:19.500
- Where did they get the money?
- No idea. We'll ask him.


40
00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:20.920
His company… I forget the name.

41
00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.000
Norbourg.

42
00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:25.840
They just requested approval
for a range of new investment funds.


43
00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:27.170
We'll have to meet him.

44
00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:29.286
QUEBEC SECURITIES COMMISSION

45
00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:33.300
Take care of it, will you?

46
00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:38.850
That's not the issue.
Your project is admissible.


47
00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:41.940
I hope so.
We've been working on it for a year.


48
00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:46.770
The problem is your involvement
with Maxima.


49
00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:52.530
The firm has had multiple irregularities
over the past few years.


50
00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:56.330
I'm sure you can understand
that my boss is getting fed up.


51
00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:01.330
Listen, Mr. Asselin,
we believe in Maxima.


52
00:07:01.566 --> 00:07:03.120
We have a recovery plan.

53
00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:05.710
We're serious about
the acquisition process.


54
00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:10.720
I can see that,
with the loan you gave them.


55
00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:14.550
And where did you get that?

56
00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:18.350
We were pretty surprised
when we saw the amount.


57
00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:21.100
I don't have to reveal
my sources of funding.


58
00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:24.600
I'm not obligated,
and you can't presume it's illegal.


59
00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:30.190
I made some money speculating
on the drop in Nortel stock,


60
00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:31.740
when it was at $160.

61
00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:35.110
And I have friends
who help me in my activities.


62
00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:38.740
I'll need more than that.

63
00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:45.960
So you're telling me
the money Norbourg put into Maxima


64
00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.750
will hinder the approval
of our funds, right?


65
00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:50.880
With the $200,000 fine my boss gave them

66
00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:53.260
and the suspension
of most of their leadership,


67
00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:54.970
Maxima is foul ball.

68
00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:58.140
It's two completely different things.

69
00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:01.220
Listen, I'll tell it like it is:

70
00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:04.770
If you don't provide documentation
on the source of funding,


71
00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:08.440
the Commission will refuse
to authorize the Maxima transaction


72
00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:10.610
and your funds won't even be considered.

73
00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:13.530
OK, well…

74
00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:16.450
What am I supposed to do with that?

75
00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:22.790
I'll propose a way to move things along.

76
00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:26.870
Don't buy Maxima,

77
00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:30.300
and maybe I can help you
with the mutual funds.


78
00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:35.550
No guarantee. We'll look into it.

79
00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:34.230
With your preventive leave,
we're at one and a half salaries.


80
00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:37.740
I know, Éric, but we always said
we'd buy before having kids.


81
00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:39.110
I know.

82
00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:44.160
There's room for a baby here.
It's not so bad.


83
00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:52.170
How did he get my number?

84
00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:54.420
Who, your mistress?

85
00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:56.800
Don't start, OK?

86
00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:01.470
Tell him I said hi.

87
00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:09.440
Yeah, I know.
I didn't have time to call you back.


88
00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:11.480
Couldn't it wait till Monday?

89
00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:15.020
I'm running out of time.
The 31st is in ten days.


90
00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:18.360
Yeah, I know what day it is.

91
00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:21.280
<i>As I'm sure you're aware,</i>

92
00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:23.570
we're entitled to a 50% tax credit.

93
00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:26.540
But if the funds aren't registered
by the end of the month,


94
00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:28.290
we're closing shop.

95
00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:30.620
Don't make me cry.

96
00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:34.630
I lost $500,000 because of your issue
with Maxima Capital.


97
00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:38.300
I feel like you could
help me get the funds approved.


98
00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:41.090
I don't owe you anything.

99
00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:43.260
<i>Look, Éric,</i>

100
00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:46.680
I know it means extra work for you.

101
00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:49.640
And I know that work
should be compensated.


102
00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:09.500
How much compensation are we talking about?

103
00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:12.170
What did you mean?

104
00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:15.710
What do you think?

105
00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:21.380
$10,000?

106
00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:23.720
Cash.

107
00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:37.190
Look, I'm going on vacation
down south on Thursday.


108
00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:41.530
I'll give you $5,000 before leaving
and the rest when I get back.


109
00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:43.450
If the funds are approved.

110
00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:57.460
For example, in January '98,

111
00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:59.170
there's a big difference.

112
00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:05.640
And in the CITR financial statements,
there are errors in the trial balance.


113
00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:07.430
Can't you get Josianne to do it?

114
00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:10.470
No, I'd prefer if you did it.
It's not just the summaries.


115
00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:12.560
We'll have to look through the documents.

116
00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:15.440
OK, give me the file.
I'll see what I can do.


117
00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:17.900
Don't look too excited!

118
00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:19.570
It's just so fun.

119
00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:26.070
Réné, you'll finish
the week with Maxima, OK?


120
00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:27.950
I'll send you my research.

121
00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:56.310
INVESTIGATOR

122
00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:00.480
- That stays at the front, guys.
- No problem.


123
00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:03.230
That box goes in
the back room with IT.

124
00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:04.650
Vince!

125
00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:10.780
I'll hang my licences here,

126
00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:14.160
and our logo at the entrance
in big letters.


127
00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:16.710
Jesus, how much are
these offices costing you?


128
00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:20.670
That's how it works, Carl.
To get rich, you have to look rich.


129
00:13:21.170 --> 00:13:22.250
Excuse me, Vincent.

130
00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:26.090
I have Éric Asselin, the investigator
from the Commission on the line for you.


131
00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:27.430
It sounds urgent.

132
00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:30.720
I'll take it.

133
00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:33.350
Shut the door, Carl.

134
00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:34.770
Yes.

135
00:13:40.770 --> 00:13:42.020
Hello?

136
00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:55.290
Hey, neighbor!

137
00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:58.370
We're right next door now, corner of Union.

138
00:13:59.170 --> 00:14:00.710
Thanks.

139
00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:05.510
Yeah, business is good.

140
00:14:06.090 --> 00:14:08.090
New downtown offices.

141
00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:10.130
Very good, even.

142
00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:14.140
Desjardins, via the Opvest branch,
gave us a large management mandate.


143
00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:15.720
It's given us a real boost.

144
00:14:15.770 --> 00:14:18.690
Listen, Vincent,
I don't have a lot of time,


145
00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:20.560
and I shouldn't be doing this…

146
00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:23.520
but there's something you should know.

147
00:14:24.070 --> 00:14:28.190
Your little ventures over the past months
have attracted a lot of attention.


148
00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:30.280
We'll be asking for documents,

149
00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:33.910
and I strongly advise you
to answer our questions properly.


150
00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:36.410
We haven't gotten a subpoena or anything.

151
00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:39.540
You could say the investigation
is still unofficial.


152
00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:42.210
My boss called the shot.

153
00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:46.170
Guess who's leading the investigation.

154
00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:07.170
Someone wants to try the car.

155
00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:29.480
Could you pass me the rag?

156
00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:37.030
Thanks.

157
00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:41.370
I'm sorry.

158
00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:55.260
So the serial number you see here
is on each unit,


159
00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:57.390
but often at the back of the machine.

160
00:16:57.430 --> 00:17:00.560
You have to pull it out
to see it, unfortunately.


161
00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:04.100
But if the serial number
doesn't match the one declared,


162
00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:07.940
that means the ATM
has probably been hacked.


163
00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:11.320
So it's important to write down the number.

164
00:17:12.690 --> 00:17:13.780
OK.

165
00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:17.900
We have to be vigilant.
There are a lot.


166
00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:21.490
Right, Guy? How many did we find
in Greater Montreal?


167
00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:11.750
Your guest is waiting at the usual table.

168
00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:18.260
Thank you, Mélissa.

169
00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:20.010
Hello!

170
00:18:25.890 --> 00:18:28.430
We spend our days
talking about you at work.


171
00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:30.650
Might as well talk about you at night.

172
00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:33.690
Not all bad things, I hope.

173
00:18:33.730 --> 00:18:35.400
That's confidential.

174
00:18:38.030 --> 00:18:40.860
But I'm hearing a lot of things.

175
00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:45.330
I even heard you're looking
for a VP of finance.


176
00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:50.250
Oh yeah? You don't miss much.

177
00:18:51.210 --> 00:18:52.250
It's true.

178
00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:54.380
I need a VP of finance

179
00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:58.050
to create Norbourg's securities division,
among other things.


180
00:18:58.090 --> 00:19:01.260
I'd also like to
get into the European game.


181
00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:07.180
Well, listen, I might know someone.

182
00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:10.810
Someone with all the qualifications,

183
00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:14.480
with experience as an investigator
at the Commission.


184
00:19:15.730 --> 00:19:17.190
Interesting…

185
00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:23.950
Such a person could certainly be useful,

186
00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:28.830
if ever the Commission started
sticking their nose in our business.


187
00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:32.210
He knows all about audits.

188
00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:37.500
He was a tax auditor for three years,
and he's been an investigator for four.


189
00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:42.220
This guy could definitely help you.
It'd be easy for him, even.


190
00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:47.640
But… he'll want to be
compensated accordingly.


191
00:19:50.430 --> 00:19:51.520
And…

192
00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:56.150
why does this person
want to quit his job?

193
00:19:58.150 --> 00:20:00.230
Vincent, I'll be straight with you.

194
00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:04.073
This person spends his days
looking at your salaries.


195
00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:06.820
He knows how much they make
on the other side.


196
00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:09.700
Well then…

197
00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:13.960
maybe this person and I should meet.

198
00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:18.000
In the meantime, let's drink to his health.

199
00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:30.970
No way we're waiting. Watch.

200
00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:39.110
Good night? Thanks.

201
00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:48.320
How did you swing that?

202
00:20:48.370 --> 00:20:50.910
You know someone
at the Ministry of Finance?


203
00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:53.290
A guy I went to university with.

204
00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:54.580
He approached you?

205
00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:57.920
No, we ran into each other last year
in Quebec City.


206
00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:01.710
I was at the investment trade fair
with my cousin.


207
00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:03.970
<i>I hadn't seen him in a decade.</i>

208
00:21:04.010 --> 00:21:06.220
<i>I didn't even know
he was at the Ministry.</i>


209
00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:15.520
Well, well!

210
00:21:17.730 --> 00:21:19.400
How's it going, chief?

211
00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:21.730
Man! I can't believe it!

212
00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:23.900
Come here. Long time no see, big guy!

213
00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:26.460
- What are you doing here?
- What are <i>you</i>doing here?


214
00:21:26.526 --> 00:21:28.780
Tell you later.
Carl Bilodeau, my cousin.


215
00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:31.700
- I'm Yan.
- Yan Raymond. We went to school together.


216
00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:34.120
- There's a few stories there.
- I can imagine.


217
00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:37.370
You're finding out before anyone.

218
00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:43.590
I'm telling you because promoting
these programs is part of my job.


219
00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:45.970
I'm definitely interested.

220
00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:48.380
I didn't know about that.

221
00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:50.760
No, it's brand new.

222
00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:54.220
"Political will," you might say.

223
00:21:57.980 --> 00:22:03.070
Anyway, there's a huge tax credit
if you start new mutual funds this year.


224
00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:11.726
<i>We crossed paths
a couple times after that.</i>


225
00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:14.290
<i>He came to help us out.</i>

226
00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:17.750
There's money to be made, Vince.

227
00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:21.080
But you gotta know how to get it.

228
00:22:23.590 --> 00:22:25.050
Guess what?

229
00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:28.300
Turns out I know how.

230
00:22:31.390 --> 00:22:34.560
This isn't the best place
to talk about it, though.


231
00:22:36.430 --> 00:22:37.810
How much do you want?

232
00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:07.420
<i>Four or five months later,
we were on the brink of bankruptcy.</i>


233
00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:14.220
Vincent, it just arrived.

234
00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:21.560
It worked? We got it?

235
00:23:22.650 --> 00:23:24.440
We got the tax credit?

236
00:23:26.150 --> 00:23:28.860
One fucking million, from the government!

237
00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:42.580
Yeah. Nice to have old college pals.

238
00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:47.380
It wasn't a gift, though.
More like the other way around.


239
00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:20.790
Thank you.

240
00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:27.670
Where did you get funds before?

241
00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:31.210
We were fucking around
in investment clubs.


242
00:24:31.970 --> 00:24:35.470
You know, it's hard to get started

243
00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:39.510
with no backers or trust fund.

244
00:24:41.470 --> 00:24:43.140
I got fed up.

245
00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:46.350
I switched strategies.

246
00:24:48.690 --> 00:24:51.480
That was about six months ago.

247
00:24:51.530 --> 00:24:54.650
It was Friday afternoon.
I was alone in the office.


248
00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:58.700
<i>I told you about the Desjardins
management mandate, the Opvest funds.</i>


249
00:24:58.740 --> 00:25:00.660
<i>Yeah, the $20 million.</i>

250
00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:20.100
Yes, is this Investpro TD?

251
00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:24.390
Yes, I'd like to make a withdrawal.

252
00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:29.150
Yes, Norbourg, Vincent Lacroix.
I'm the president.


253
00:25:30.650 --> 00:25:33.280
January 11, 1967.

254
00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:39.820
Yes, a $150,000 withdrawal
from the Opvest RT1 account.


255
00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:46.460
Yes, I want to do a simulation
to test a new model.


256
00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:50.340
Sort of a research and development thing.

257
00:25:50.790 --> 00:25:53.630
Just to make sure everything
performs as expected.


258
00:25:54.210 --> 00:25:56.420
I had an ironclad explanation.

259
00:25:56.470 --> 00:25:59.180
I thought I'd have to tell him
my life story.


260
00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:00.600
But not at all.

261
00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:03.560
They transferred the cash,
no questions asked.


262
00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:08.940
Yes, in the National Bank Norbourg account.

263
00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:12.570
The number is… Sorry.

264
00:26:12.610 --> 00:26:16.360
It's 2364292.

265
00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:18.860
Transit: 76451.

266
00:26:22.990 --> 00:26:25.160
No, thank you. 
That'll be all.

267
00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:26.580
Thank you.

268
00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:40.180
I don't understand.

269
00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:43.550
You deposit the money
in the Norbourg account directly?


270
00:26:44.350 --> 00:26:47.270
No, we put the money back.
No one is the wiser.


271
00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:49.390
It's just to unblock capital.

272
00:26:51.020 --> 00:26:52.270
You know, Éric,

273
00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:57.070
to move forward,
get bigger and stronger,


274
00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:59.530
we have no choice but to gamble.

275
00:26:59.570 --> 00:27:02.740
You put it back
or you're going to put it back?


276
00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:07.750
You shouldn't do that.

277
00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:11.000
What we need…

278
00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:12.920
What <i>we</i>need?

279
00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:15.460
You, what you need.

280
00:27:16.170 --> 00:27:20.930
What you need is some kind of buffer
before depositing the money.


281
00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:22.760
A transit account.

282
00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:25.100
Otherwise, you're too exposed.

283
00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:30.890
Yeah, I know.
We'll have to look into it.


284
00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:35.150
And why Molton Trust as custodian?

285
00:27:35.690 --> 00:27:37.190
Get this:

286
00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:39.150
They have offices in Montreal.

287
00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:41.900
Customer service is in Toronto.

288
00:27:41.950 --> 00:27:46.580
Money transfers and banking operations
are in London,


289
00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:49.950
supervised by the parent company's
back office in Chicago.


290
00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.500
It's just about the most complex
organizational chart you can get.


291
00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:55.920
Hey, get your friend, will you?

292
00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:01.550
For financial statements?

293
00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:05.680
That's not a problem.
My accountant is very accommodating.


294
00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:10.480
Come on, Vincent, this is absurd.
Why should I approve this?


295
00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:12.140
Give me one good reason.

296
00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:16.270
I gave you 20,000, 
Denis, in small bills.

297
00:28:27.910 --> 00:28:29.490
See you soon.

298
00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:32.580
The question now, Éric,

299
00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:36.380
is would you rather hop on the train
and make some cash,


300
00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:39.090
or stay a small-time accountant
making $600 a week


301
00:28:39.130 --> 00:28:40.800
with your nose in our books?

302
00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:44.550
In January, I get my yearly bonus.

303
00:28:47.390 --> 00:28:50.970
After that, make me an offer.
We'll see.


304
00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:03.610
Thank you, Mr. Larrivée.

305
00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:07.320
Listen…

306
00:29:09.910 --> 00:29:14.040
I know my timing isn't great,
but I don't want to waste your time.


307
00:29:15.290 --> 00:29:16.830
I'm handing in my notice.

308
00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:20.130
What are you talking about, Éric?

309
00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:22.800
Sit. Let's talk.

310
00:29:23.630 --> 00:29:26.300
We can discuss your salary and benefits.

311
00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:28.800
I wasn't expecting this at all.

312
00:29:28.850 --> 00:29:29.930
I'm sorry.

313
00:29:30.390 --> 00:29:32.600
It's not you or the team.

314
00:29:33.430 --> 00:29:36.520
I feel like my time here is done.

315
00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:38.230
Come on!

316
00:29:41.270 --> 00:29:43.110
Who are we losing you to?

317
00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:47.860
I don't know yet.
I have a few prospects.


318
00:29:49.030 --> 00:29:51.410
You're kind of leaving us
in the lurch, Éric.


319
00:29:52.410 --> 00:29:56.410
But we can provide references
or letters of recommendation if you need.


320
00:29:56.460 --> 00:29:57.670
No thank you.

321
00:29:58.330 --> 00:30:00.040
That won't be necessary.

322
00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:27.400
Four years? OK.
You're good with the salary?


323
00:30:27.450 --> 00:30:32.120
Yes. But as I told you,
I'm more interested in the bonuses.


324
00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:35.870
Paid cash, when I see fit,
as an undeclared loan.


325
00:30:35.910 --> 00:30:38.080
Yeah, like we discussed.

326
00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:43.920
As for the signing bonus…

327
00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:45.460
$120,000, right?

328
00:30:46.050 --> 00:30:47.220
I'll write you a check.

329
00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:50.930
No, you should transfer the money
to your account,


330
00:30:50.970 --> 00:30:55.140
get a bank draft,
then write a personal check.


331
00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:57.520
Come on, Éric. Toughen up.

332
00:30:57.560 --> 00:30:59.940
You know the situation with Commission.

333
00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:02.020
I told you they're coming down on us.

334
00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:03.110
As you wish.

335
00:31:03.150 --> 00:31:06.650
I don't want my name in the books
with payments like that.


336
00:31:08.610 --> 00:31:10.200
How do I look?

337
00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:23.390
There you have it.

338
00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:30.690
$400,000, just like that?

339
00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:35.160
Just like that.
They never caught on.


340
00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:38.450
And because we write
our clients' account statements…


341
00:32:38.490 --> 00:32:39.950
I don't have to spell it out.

342
00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:46.210
It's the only way we can grow.
I don't see any other options.


343
00:32:47.670 --> 00:32:50.550
Yeah, but you'll have to return the cash.

344
00:32:50.590 --> 00:32:54.010
Of course!
It's all about timing.


345
00:32:54.050 --> 00:32:55.720
It's a poker game.

346
00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:08.690
OK, as most of you are aware,

347
00:33:08.730 --> 00:33:13.740
today, we're officially welcoming
our new VP of finance, Éric Asselin.


348
00:33:14.610 --> 00:33:15.660
Welcome!

349
00:33:17.490 --> 00:33:20.370
Éric will be starting immediately.

350
00:33:20.950 --> 00:33:23.120
So let's raise our glasses. Cheers!

351
00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:26.000
- Cheers!
- Welcome.


352
00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:28.210
Cheers, Éric.

353
00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:31.550
Well, thank you.

354
00:33:32.010 --> 00:33:35.300
Speeches aren't really my thing.
I'll leave that to Vincent.


355
00:33:36.010 --> 00:33:39.470
I just want to say
I'm happy to be here.


356
00:33:41.390 --> 00:33:42.640
Switzerland.

357
00:33:43.270 --> 00:33:47.230
I'd like to take a moment to tell you
about our new resolution for 2002:


358
00:33:47.270 --> 00:33:48.480
Switzerland.

359
00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:51.940
One-third of the world's wealth is there.

360
00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:56.780
An ambitious, growing firm like Norbourg
can't afford to miss out on that market.


361
00:33:56.820 --> 00:34:00.030
So 2002 will be the year of…

362
00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:01.410
Give me a hand.

363
00:34:04.790 --> 00:34:06.540
Eurobourg!

364
00:34:08.830 --> 00:34:10.960
Cheers!

365
00:34:15.550 --> 00:34:17.680
I know just the guy for Switzerland.

366
00:34:18.430 --> 00:34:23.310
He handles between $300 and $400 million,
and he's consul for an African country.


367
00:34:23.850 --> 00:34:25.430
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.


368
00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:27.060
I went to school with his son.

369
00:34:27.770 --> 00:34:32.020
So why isn't he working for us yet?

370
00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:54.840
Vincent Lacroix…

371
00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:03.140
Our enviable positioning
in the North American market


372
00:35:03.180 --> 00:35:06.600
gives us a clear advantage
over other players.


373
00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:09.640
The acquisition of Tercio Trust
in the short term


374
00:35:09.690 --> 00:35:13.230
would put Eurobourg at the forefront
of the Swiss hedge fund world.


375
00:35:13.270 --> 00:35:17.740
As you see here,
the Tercio team would remain intact,


376
00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:21.240
and the transition to Eurobourg
would happen gradually.


377
00:37:33.580 --> 00:37:34.870
Vince!

378
00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:40.000
Don't send the fax yet!

379
00:37:41.170 --> 00:37:44.340
What are you doing?
That's the confirmation. The fax is sent.


380
00:37:44.380 --> 00:37:47.590
The USS01 account is $300,000 overdrawn.

381
00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:50.050
Fucking hell! You idiot!

382
00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:52.600
Do you know
the Molton Chicago number by heart?


383
00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:18.460
It's the transfer confirmation. Hang up!

384
00:38:21.130 --> 00:38:22.250
It worked.

385
00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:26.340
The account is $654,000 overdrawn now,
and they sent the money anyway.


386
00:38:26.380 --> 00:38:29.640
OK, how much do we have
in ULC02 and USS04?


387
00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:31.470
I'll have to check.

388
00:38:31.510 --> 00:38:32.720
We'll balance it.

389
00:38:57.710 --> 00:38:59.120
Thanks, Brigitte.

390
00:39:01.130 --> 00:39:02.840
You don't understand.

391
00:39:03.630 --> 00:39:06.130
A former colleague
at the Commission just told me


392
00:39:06.170 --> 00:39:08.510
the inspection is this fall, no way out.

393
00:39:08.550 --> 00:39:11.760
We'll just have to
make false bills and reports.


394
00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:13.260
We'll do better than that.

395
00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:15.600
We have to start thinking long-term.

396
00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:18.730
The safest way is to declare revenue
from external companies.


397
00:39:18.770 --> 00:39:22.060
The Tercio Trust subsidiaries
in Switzerland are our best bet.


398
00:39:22.110 --> 00:39:25.280
That's good, Vincent.
We own Tercio.


399
00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:29.700
We control the archives, books
and financial statements from past years.


400
00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:32.070
We all know there's a firewall
for Switzerland.


401
00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:35.160
We twist things right,
it'll be hard for the Commission.


402
00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:37.910
They don't have the jurisdiction
or the staff.


403
00:39:37.950 --> 00:39:39.250
I'll take the lead on this.

404
00:39:39.290 --> 00:39:42.250
I know what they're looking for
and how they work.


405
00:39:42.290 --> 00:39:44.340
I know how they think. Trust me.

406
00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:47.050
So let's get to work.
Serficom is ready?


407
00:39:47.090 --> 00:39:48.550
Yes, it's settled.

408
00:39:49.970 --> 00:39:51.630
We'll need more.

409
00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:57.233
The purchase agreements
for Moulty Bay Holdings and Grace Venture?


410
00:39:57.286 --> 00:39:59.850
No shells or shady offshore dealings.

411
00:39:59.890 --> 00:40:01.890
You give them those,
it opens a breach.


412
00:40:03.690 --> 00:40:06.770
Éric, I'll let you handle it
if you know what you're doing.


413
00:40:06.820 --> 00:40:09.280
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
I know what I'm doing.


414
00:40:10.650 --> 00:40:13.950
I'm also pretty sure we'll need help.

415
00:40:13.990 --> 00:40:17.120
We're taking a massive beating
with the hedge funds.


416
00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:35.260
Hello, hello!

417
00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:38.680
- Welcome to Norbourg.
- Hello.


418
00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:41.020
I'm Vincent, CEO.

419
00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:46.150
Our new vice president-general manager,
Jean-Marie Davila. A big fish.


420
00:40:46.190 --> 00:40:47.570
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello.


421
00:40:47.610 --> 00:40:49.070
Seven years at the Caisse,

422
00:40:49.110 --> 00:40:52.950
three at the FTQ
and two years at BNP Paribas in Paris.


423
00:40:52.990 --> 00:40:56.320
I'm sure we'll have time
to discuss his resumé later.


424
00:40:56.910 --> 00:41:00.120
Would you like a coffee before starting?

425
00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:01.830
Where should we set up?

426
00:41:02.370 --> 00:41:03.750
Follow me.

427
00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:08.000
If you need any documents, just ask,
and we'll get them.


428
00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:11.260
Yes, that's how an inspection
usually works.


429
00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:16.140
And you'll be in familiar territory
with an expert who needs no introduction.


430
00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:19.850
Anne
-Marie, Guy…

431
00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:21.680
Ah, René.

432
00:41:24.230 --> 00:41:25.310
Good to see you.

433
00:41:30.190 --> 00:41:33.570
Come on, Éric, do we really have to
do this with you?


434
00:41:43.540 --> 00:41:46.710
Well, why not? 
Let's do this.

435
00:41:47.460 --> 00:41:49.590
OK, let's start with compliance.

436
00:41:49.630 --> 00:41:52.300
We want to see the company's
organizational chart


437
00:41:52.340 --> 00:41:54.630
and all the certificates of incorporation.

438
00:41:55.050 --> 00:41:57.590
No problem. I'll explain all that to you.

439
00:41:58.430 --> 00:41:59.970
I'm leaving you in good hands.

440
00:42:00.010 --> 00:42:02.430
If you need anything, 
I'm right next door.

441
00:42:02.470 --> 00:42:03.890
Thank you, Vincent.

442
00:42:06.190 --> 00:42:09.190
This won't work, Éric.
We can't do this.


443
00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:12.400
You're the one that started
the Norbourg investigation.


444
00:42:17.233 --> 00:42:20.410
Why don't you designate
someone else as our contact?


445
00:42:20.450 --> 00:42:21.620
Yeah.

446
00:42:27.870 --> 00:42:31.420
This is the most ridiculous situation
I've ever been in.


447
00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:35.340
Seriously, Éric,
you could have spared us this farce.


448
00:42:35.380 --> 00:42:37.220
We'll start with the parent company?

449
00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:40.640
Yes, we have some questions
about the shareholders.


450
00:42:42.510 --> 00:42:44.020
I'm listening.

451
00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:49.440
The VLX from March 2000 is missing.

452
00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:54.280
How do you explain
the $150,000 difference in amortization?


453
00:42:56.190 --> 00:42:57.530
<i>I don't understand, Éric.</i>

454
00:42:57.570 --> 00:43:01.530
The private management mandates
for Dubrovsky, Ranhold and Robertson


455
00:43:01.570 --> 00:43:05.120
are with a broker who trades
in derivative products.


456
00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:07.460
Is that what you're telling me?

457
00:43:07.870 --> 00:43:11.580
And these amounts here… Thank you.

458
00:43:11.630 --> 00:43:16.130
Why are they in "Vincent Lacroix Advances."
What is that?


459
00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:18.550
Let me have a look.

460
00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:23.600
Yeah, I don't know.
Must be in the archives.


461
00:43:25.010 --> 00:43:29.940
The report must be in my files at home.
I think that's it.


462
00:43:31.770 --> 00:43:35.530
That must be at the accountant's office
in La Prairie, right, Vincent?


463
00:43:35.570 --> 00:43:37.570
That's it. Don't worry.

464
00:43:37.610 --> 00:43:40.820
We'll get you all the documents
by tomorrow.


465
00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:54.250
Have a good evening.

466
00:43:55.210 --> 00:43:56.300
Thanks for coming.

467
00:43:56.340 --> 00:43:57.760
See you tomorrow.

468
00:44:03.050 --> 00:44:04.470
Fuck.

469
00:44:07.970 --> 00:44:09.560
Starting now,

470
00:44:10.060 --> 00:44:12.600
extra entertainment expenses
will be cash.


471
00:44:12.650 --> 00:44:14.980
They're staying out of our books.
Is that clear?


472
00:44:15.020 --> 00:44:17.820
Don't worry.
They don't have anything on us yet.


473
00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:20.650
So, you have the list to produce?

474
00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:24.410
Yeah. Another night shift for us.

475
00:45:59.210 --> 00:46:01.420
- That'll hit the spot.
- Thanks.


476
00:46:14.230 --> 00:46:15.940
It's gonna be fine.

477
00:46:15.980 --> 00:46:17.150
Here we go again.

478
00:46:21.020 --> 00:46:22.280
Welcome back!

479
00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:24.030
- Hello.
- Have a seat.


480
00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:29.070
Today, Éric, I want to
talk about the custodians,


481
00:46:29.120 --> 00:46:33.080
so Investpro TD,
but especially Molton Trust.


482
00:46:33.620 --> 00:46:37.250
We have questions about
the way Molton Trust documents


483
00:46:37.290 --> 00:46:38.790
regarding the funds' value

484
00:46:38.830 --> 00:46:41.290
are sent to Norbourg.

485
00:46:41.340 --> 00:46:44.210
- Oh yeah?
- There seem to be different procedures.


486
00:46:44.260 --> 00:46:47.840
That's because their
Montreal offices closed,


487
00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:50.850
and we changed intermediaries
along the way.


488
00:46:50.890 --> 00:46:53.890
OK, well, we just want
supporting documentation.


489
00:46:54.680 --> 00:46:56.230
For what period?

490
00:46:56.680 --> 00:46:58.480
Today is October 1?

491
00:46:58.520 --> 00:47:03.110
Then the account statements from October 1
for 1999, 2000 and 2001.


492
00:47:04.110 --> 00:47:06.530
OK, we'll get them for you.

493
00:47:06.570 --> 00:47:09.450
So you're gonna bring
us a piece of paper?

494
00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:11.620
What will that prove?

495
00:47:11.660 --> 00:47:14.290
There's not much more
we can do, Anne-Marie.


496
00:47:14.330 --> 00:47:16.790
We could find the originals.

497
00:47:16.830 --> 00:47:19.170
But those are in the archives too, right?

498
00:47:19.210 --> 00:47:21.580
Yeah, and we'd need to
search the old database,


499
00:47:21.630 --> 00:47:22.840
and our head IT guy is…

500
00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:25.800
He's been out sick. We know.

501
00:47:39.980 --> 00:47:42.020
Everything OK here?

502
00:47:42.060 --> 00:47:43.270
Yeah, all good.

503
00:47:49.950 --> 00:47:51.450
Come on…

504
00:47:51.490 --> 00:47:53.700
OK, let me see those emails.

505
00:47:53.740 --> 00:47:55.620
OK, which ones do you want to see?

506
00:47:55.660 --> 00:47:57.120
One from Molton Trust.

507
00:47:57.160 --> 00:47:58.750
There are hundreds.

508
00:47:58.790 --> 00:48:01.790
Show me one with an account statement.

509
00:48:06.590 --> 00:48:08.550
Like this one.

510
00:48:09.300 --> 00:48:11.340
That work?

511
00:48:13.930 --> 00:48:15.100
DOWNLOAD ERROR

512
00:48:16.510 --> 00:48:20.770
Yeah. Our servers are having backup issues.
I'll show you another one.


513
00:48:21.350 --> 00:48:23.310
I want to see that one.

514
00:48:23.350 --> 00:48:27.070
OK, but we have IT bugs.
And like I said, our IT guy…


515
00:48:27.110 --> 00:48:30.740
Yeah, bad timing, huh?
Your IT guy is on the brink of death.


516
00:48:30.780 --> 00:48:33.320
Hang on. I'll call him.
Maybe he can help.


517
00:48:43.290 --> 00:48:45.670
UPDATING DATABASE

518
00:48:49.380 --> 00:48:50.800
Hello?

519
00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:53.180
Hi, Richard. How are you?

520
00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:55.090
Feeling better?

521
00:48:55.890 --> 00:48:57.930
I think you have the wrong number.

522
00:48:57.970 --> 00:48:59.100
Give me that!

523
00:49:00.390 --> 00:49:03.270
Jesus! They're still on
the Molton Trust statements?


524
00:49:06.190 --> 00:49:07.320
What year? 2001?

525
00:49:09.940 --> 00:49:11.030
2002?

526
00:49:11.070 --> 00:49:14.610
Listen, I'd really like to know

527
00:49:15.070 --> 00:49:17.200
when you think you'll be back at work.

528
00:49:17.240 --> 00:49:18.530
When?

529
00:49:18.580 --> 00:49:22.750
When? Oh, January? February? March?

530
00:49:22.790 --> 00:49:23.920
Yes.

531
00:49:24.193 --> 00:49:27.840
Write an email with
NTBO account statements for March 2002


532
00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:29.170
with the number we declared.

533
00:49:29.210 --> 00:49:31.090
- Hurry! Go!
- OK, I'm on it.


534
00:49:32.510 --> 00:49:34.340
Let's go, let's go!

535
00:49:38.890 --> 00:49:42.180
For a firm trying to play
in the major leagues,


536
00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:45.560
you guys have serious
organizational issues.


537
00:49:46.100 --> 00:49:50.860
Listen, I think Norbourg
is a victim of its rapid growth.


538
00:49:50.900 --> 00:49:52.990
We work 90 hours a week.

539
00:49:53.650 --> 00:49:56.660
Don't worry. We're hiring new people.

540
00:49:56.700 --> 00:49:58.160
We'll adjust.

541
00:50:00.870 --> 00:50:02.330
OK…

542
00:50:03.450 --> 00:50:07.130
I think we'll have to change our schedule
and come back next week.


543
00:50:07.170 --> 00:50:10.130
There's a lot left to clear up here.

544
00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:20.720
Hello?

545
00:50:20.760 --> 00:50:22.970
Brigitte, it's Éric.
What are they doing?


546
00:50:23.020 --> 00:50:24.060
March!

547
00:50:24.100 --> 00:50:25.230
I got it!

548
00:50:25.270 --> 00:50:28.940
They're leaving,
and they don't look happy.


549
00:50:28.980 --> 00:50:30.320
Hurry!

550
00:50:33.480 --> 00:50:34.860
You're being a bit harsh.

551
00:50:34.900 --> 00:50:37.490
We're acting in good faith.
Let us prove it.


552
00:50:37.530 --> 00:50:39.950
You'll prove it next Monday.

553
00:50:39.990 --> 00:50:44.540
We'll be back with more staff,
and your tech issues better be fixed.


554
00:50:47.210 --> 00:50:48.960
Have a nice day, ma'am.

555
00:50:54.510 --> 00:50:55.920
OK, it's printing!

556
00:50:56.840 --> 00:50:59.720
Come on, come on!

557
00:51:00.260 --> 00:51:01.760
Got it.

558
00:51:07.350 --> 00:51:09.440
Are they gone? 
Where are they?

559
00:51:10.360 --> 00:51:11.940
Anne
-Marie, wait.

560
00:51:13.270 --> 00:51:16.240
We rebooted the entire system,
and it worked.


561
00:51:16.280 --> 00:51:19.030
They told me what email you wanted,
and I printed it.


562
00:51:19.070 --> 00:51:22.030
If you want any others,
just tell me.


563
00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:24.080
Ma'am, it's all pretty standard.

564
00:51:24.120 --> 00:51:26.700
Molton Trust sends statements each month.

565
00:51:26.750 --> 00:51:30.080
We put those numbers
in our account statements to investors.


566
00:51:30.540 --> 00:51:34.210
Obviously, we translate them,
since most of our clients speak French.


567
00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:41.300
OK, well, I know you'll miss us,

568
00:51:41.340 --> 00:51:44.970
but that'll be all for this time.

569
00:51:47.350 --> 00:51:49.350
So you won't be back Monday?

570
00:52:02.280 --> 00:52:04.530
You're the man!

571
00:52:40.190 --> 00:52:43.530
I might have a little marker here.

572
00:52:43.570 --> 00:52:45.490
This one is special.

573
00:52:45.530 --> 00:52:46.950
It's white.

574
00:53:08.850 --> 00:53:10.100
Hello.

575
00:53:10.810 --> 00:53:11.890
Hello.

576
00:53:16.900 --> 00:53:20.860
OK, the markets are open.
Today, we're focusing on Dismatik S.A.


577
00:53:20.900 --> 00:53:22.740
I want that shell, OK? Let's go.

578
00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:29.660
Hey, Vince, there's a chance to get Dagua.

579
00:53:29.700 --> 00:53:31.080
I want to talk to him.

580
00:53:31.960 --> 00:53:33.210
Put him on my line.

581
00:53:33.620 --> 00:53:36.460
I'm transferring him. It's done!

582
00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:41.170
Jean-Luc! I hear you have
something that might interest me.


583
00:53:41.210 --> 00:53:42.260
<i>Yeah.</i>

584
00:53:42.300 --> 00:53:43.470
Talk to me.

585
00:54:06.740 --> 00:54:08.240
Welcome, gentlemen.

586
00:54:15.750 --> 00:54:18.290
The Molton Trust Chicago guys are in town!

587
00:54:18.330 --> 00:54:20.630
We'll show them how we party in Montreal.

588
00:54:44.313 --> 00:54:48.070
<i>Our thorough inspection
found just a few technical infractions.</i>


589
00:54:48.110 --> 00:54:50.160
<i>However, we retain
some noteworthy concerns.</i>


590
00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:55.330
<i>During the inspection, Norbourg's level
of collaboration was suspect.</i>


591
00:55:03.380 --> 00:55:06.590
<i>We cannot state with certainty</i>

592
00:55:06.630 --> 00:55:10.510
<i>that the information provided…</i>

593
00:55:43.980 --> 00:55:46.760
<i>While we lack proof of embezzlement,</i>

594
00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:48.260
<i>we observed several atypical practices:</i>

595
00:55:48.300 --> 00:55:50.680
<i>To explain the millions withdrawn
from accounts managed by Norbourg,</i>


596
00:55:50.720 --> 00:55:53.300
<i>Vincent Lacroix produced an agreement
between himself and Tercio Trust,</i>


597
00:55:53.350 --> 00:55:55.180
<i>essentially allowing him
to draw unlimited advances</i>


598
00:55:55.220 --> 00:55:56.470
<i>on the $30 million entrusted to him.</i>

599
00:55:56.520 --> 00:56:01.353
<i>This unusual practice allows him to
finance his operations using client funds.</i>


600
00:56:03.020 --> 00:56:05.530
<i>It may be worth
investigating Vincent Lacroix.</i>


601
00:56:05.570 --> 00:56:07.110
<i>After extensive examination,</i>

602
00:56:07.150 --> 00:56:12.020
<i>we cannot guarantee statements
by Molton Trust have not been altered.</i>


603
00:56:19.080 --> 00:56:23.040
A LIBERAL MAJORITY

604
00:56:25.460 --> 00:56:28.606
NORBOURG ASSET MANAGEMENT
OFFICIAL INVESTIGATION


605
00:56:46.320 --> 00:56:49.280
TO BE PROCESSED

606
00:56:55.330 --> 00:56:58.160
- They bought Unicyme?
- They buy everything!


607
00:56:58.200 --> 00:57:01.410
The board must have
done their due diligence.


608
00:57:01.460 --> 00:57:02.830
Don't be naïve, Guy!

609
00:57:02.870 --> 00:57:06.040
They've obviously
pulled the wool over their eyes.


610
00:57:06.090 --> 00:57:09.620
How do you think
they're funding these acquisitions?


611
00:57:11.260 --> 00:57:14.260
Yeah, and meanwhile,
we're restructuring,


612
00:57:14.300 --> 00:57:17.140
reorganizing, reengineering,

613
00:57:17.180 --> 00:57:19.220
new offices, new name,

614
00:57:19.270 --> 00:57:21.680
new color of underwear,
for Christ's sake.


615
00:57:21.730 --> 00:57:24.393
It's been months
since a file moved forward.


616
00:57:31.190 --> 00:57:36.570
QUEBEC FINANCIAL INDUSTRY
REGULATORY AGENCY


617
00:57:44.710 --> 00:57:47.750
<i>We're particularly interested
in the Evolution Fund.</i>


618
00:57:47.790 --> 00:57:49.800
<i>It's been for sale for a while.</i>

619
00:57:49.840 --> 00:57:52.550
<i>I'm sure we could make a deal.</i>

620
00:57:53.590 --> 00:57:55.550
<i>We'll look into it, Mr. Lacroix.</i>

621
00:57:56.260 --> 00:57:59.640
But you must know
that fund is in deficit.

622
00:57:59.680 --> 00:58:01.930
Yes, we're aware.

623
00:58:01.980 --> 00:58:05.230
That's just it.
I'm guessing buyers aren't lining up.


624
00:58:06.940 --> 00:58:10.320
Mr. Asselin, we'll keep
that information to ourselves.


625
00:58:11.230 --> 00:58:13.240
No problem. We understand.

626
00:58:13.280 --> 00:58:17.950
But this type of acquisition
has sort of become our trademark:


627
00:58:17.990 --> 00:58:21.330
struggling products at a good price.

628
00:58:21.790 --> 00:58:24.460
And with our team's exceptional expertise,

629
00:58:24.500 --> 00:58:27.250
I guarantee we'll turn it
into a success story.


630
00:58:29.040 --> 00:58:32.090
Allow me to present our business plan,

631
00:58:32.130 --> 00:58:36.180
our vision for the future
of the Evolution Fund at Norbourg.


632
00:58:40.260 --> 00:58:43.930
At the Caisse,
there's been changes in policy.


633
00:58:43.980 --> 00:58:48.940
I'd even say a transformation
since the Liberals took power.


634
00:58:48.980 --> 00:58:51.610
We have to sell, and fast.

635
00:58:51.650 --> 00:58:54.030
Before the end of 2003, if possible.

636
00:58:54.070 --> 00:58:57.990
Don't worry, Marcel,
you'll get your bonuses.


637
00:59:01.490 --> 00:59:03.080
I'm counting on you.

638
00:59:03.120 --> 00:59:05.910
With Norbourg, it's a perfect match.

639
00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:15.800
EVOLUTION FUND

640
00:59:40.700 --> 00:59:42.160
Thanks!

641
00:59:56.130 --> 00:59:59.760
<i>The fund's managers
performed exceptionally this year…</i>


642
01:00:11.793 --> 01:00:16.320
<i>Please note the Evolution Fund is now owned
by Norbourg Financial Services.</i>


643
01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:18.240
<i>This will have
no impact on your agreement.</i>


644
01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:19.780
<i>We continue to serve your interests.</i>

645
01:00:19.820 --> 01:00:22.320
<i>Thank you! Just a couple minutes.</i>

646
01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:26.160
Some say that Norbourg is on track

647
01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:29.540
to revolutionize the world
of independent financial advisors.


648
01:00:29.580 --> 01:00:31.790
It's true. We hear it often.

649
01:00:31.830 --> 01:00:35.380
Those working with us know it, right?

650
01:00:36.210 --> 01:00:39.970
And those joining our team
will soon find out.


651
01:00:40.010 --> 01:00:44.633
Norbourg is already revolutionizing
the world of financial advisors.


652
01:00:51.020 --> 01:00:52.980
So to mark the occasion,

653
01:00:53.020 --> 01:00:57.690
I'm offering you all
a bottle of our special Norbourg vintage,


654
01:00:57.730 --> 01:01:01.030
Bordeaux Supérieur appellation,
year 2000!


655
01:01:04.370 --> 01:01:06.830
And I wrote the label myself,

656
01:01:06.870 --> 01:01:09.830
so please allow me
to read a few lines.

657
01:01:11.210 --> 01:01:15.840
"Norbourg's highly qualified team,

658
01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:18.800
"specialized and multidisciplinary,

659
01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:21.670
"puts care into meeting
the financial goals and needs


660
01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:23.380
"of its clients and partners

661
01:01:23.970 --> 01:01:26.890
"to produce the best vintage there is…

662
01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:29.520
the creation of capital."

663
01:01:57.250 --> 01:02:00.840
You should come to the benefit dinner
for my election campaign.


664
01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:03.993
AN EXPERIENCED POLITICIAN
FOR A UNITED QUEBEC


665
01:02:05.090 --> 01:02:06.760
I'll do more than that.

666
01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:10.770
Asselin! Asselin! Asselin!

667
01:02:36.870 --> 01:02:39.210
And the Caisse doesn't own it anymore?

668
01:02:39.250 --> 01:02:40.500
No.

669
01:02:41.170 --> 01:02:44.670
They sold it on the sly
to a company called Norbourg.


670
01:02:48.260 --> 01:02:50.260
Paul-Émile…

671
01:02:52.270 --> 01:02:54.230
I don't know how to tell you this.

672
01:02:55.230 --> 01:02:57.100
I'll be honest with you.

673
01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:01.190
I went to a party at their offices,

674
01:03:01.230 --> 01:03:05.450
sort of a big pow-wow to grease the palms
of Evolution Fund brokers.


675
01:03:06.070 --> 01:03:08.110
I didn't like what I saw.

676
01:03:09.530 --> 01:03:14.540
The head of Norbourg, Vincent Lacroix,
I didn't like his face.


677
01:03:15.290 --> 01:03:17.420
He acts like some kind of big shot.

678
01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:22.800
So, if you'll allow me…

679
01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:27.220
I'll make a couple calls
and get your money out of there.


680
01:03:29.050 --> 01:03:33.430
Right now,
there are better funds on the market.


681
01:03:38.900 --> 01:03:45.360
FINANCIAL MARKETS AUTHORITY

682
01:04:09.300 --> 01:04:12.300
Vince, we have to cool it
on the acquisitions.


683
01:04:12.350 --> 01:04:13.640
People are starting to talk.

684
01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:15.720
No, come on.
We can't waste time with that.


685
01:04:15.770 --> 01:04:18.180
Jesus, Vincent, it's nonstop!

686
01:04:18.230 --> 01:04:21.270
We have to keep the hundreds of new reps
from jumping ship.


687
01:04:21.310 --> 01:04:24.230
How you gonna do that?
Parties and hockey games won't cut it.


688
01:04:24.270 --> 01:04:27.320
I have two words for you: Cayo Coco.

689
01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:28.990
A nice little chartered trip!

690
01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:32.320
Come on! You can't be serious.

691
01:04:34.490 --> 01:04:39.410
All-inclusive premium package,
one week at the four-star Costa Azul Club.


692
01:04:40.420 --> 01:04:42.170
That convincing enough for you?

693
01:04:42.210 --> 01:04:43.920
I got a good group deal.

694
01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:51.690
Hello?

695
01:05:52.450 --> 01:05:53.910
Hi, Mr. Trudel?

696
01:05:54.700 --> 01:05:58.280
I looked into the conditions
to withdraw your money,


697
01:05:58.330 --> 01:06:00.660
and it's not standard.

698
01:06:01.450 --> 01:06:05.580
It would cost nearly $15,000
to take out the inheritance.


699
01:06:08.710 --> 01:06:10.920
What do you think we should do?

700
01:06:12.090 --> 01:06:14.260
Well, if you agree,

701
01:06:14.300 --> 01:06:18.260
we can leave the money there for now.

702
01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:23.600
And I'll be sure to keep an eye
on Lacroix and his gang.


703
01:06:28.110 --> 01:06:30.690
If you think that's best,
let's do that.


704
01:06:33.610 --> 01:06:34.990
Thank you.

705
01:06:55.380 --> 01:06:57.510
How are the sunburns?

706
01:06:57.930 --> 01:06:59.970
You'll have to slather me with lotion.

707
01:07:00.850 --> 01:07:04.806
Don't forget your meeting with
the <i>Finance et Investissement</i>journalist.


708
01:07:04.890 --> 01:07:07.900
Shit! I completely forgot.
Is he here?


709
01:07:07.940 --> 01:07:09.730
Yeah, he's at reception.

710
01:07:09.770 --> 01:07:12.480
OK, bring him to the conference room.

711
01:07:15.900 --> 01:07:18.910
We also draw revenue from
our private banking service,


712
01:07:18.950 --> 01:07:22.790
where we have several clients
with portfolios worth over $10 million.


713
01:07:22.830 --> 01:07:26.080
Hedge funds are another source of profit.

714
01:07:26.120 --> 01:07:27.420
Over the past three years,

715
01:07:27.460 --> 01:07:30.710
Desjardins entrusted us
with a major management mandate.


716
01:07:31.630 --> 01:07:33.210
Desjardins…

717
01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:38.340
Let's talk about the Evolution Fund,
a nice acquisition for Norbourg.


718
01:07:38.380 --> 01:07:39.430
Indeed!

719
01:07:39.470 --> 01:07:43.100
The Evolution Fund also had
a positive effect on our profits:


720
01:07:43.140 --> 01:07:45.890
In the first quarter,
we posted a $25,000 profit,


721
01:07:45.930 --> 01:07:49.650
while the previous owner recorded
a $1.2 million loss.


722
01:07:49.690 --> 01:07:51.310
An impressive recovery.

723
01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:55.570
It's because we decided
to manage the fund internally.


724
01:07:55.610 --> 01:07:58.780
Of course, our profits
will continue to increase


725
01:07:58.820 --> 01:08:01.570
when our back-office activities resume.

726
01:08:01.620 --> 01:08:04.870
Yes. Will you have to
stop the asset erosion?


727
01:08:04.910 --> 01:08:09.960
Because in one year, the asset under
management by the Evolution Fund family


728
01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.750
went from $109 to $98 million,

729
01:08:12.790 --> 01:08:16.130
according to IFIC statistics
dated April 30.


730
01:08:16.550 --> 01:08:20.680
Yes, but that's normal.

731
01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:24.810
When you make an acquisition like that,
there's always a few it no longer suits,


732
01:08:24.850 --> 01:08:27.390
for all kinds of reasons.

733
01:08:27.980 --> 01:08:30.600
That explains the slight depreciation.

734
01:08:31.020 --> 01:08:34.940
But, Mr. Lacroix, we're not talking
about a slight depreciation.


735
01:08:34.980 --> 01:08:39.990
And I learned that a core group of
Teraxis reps specialized in mutual funds


736
01:08:40.030 --> 01:08:44.200
jumped ship with $40 million in assets
they had under management.


737
01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:49.250
That's true.
A group of representatives did leave.


738
01:08:49.290 --> 01:08:52.830
But that was planned
before we took possession of Teraxis.


739
01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:56.670
They never attended the conference
Norbourg hosted for the advisors.


740
01:08:57.460 --> 01:09:01.800
It must have been another hard hit
when two big names on your board left?


741
01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:04.640
I mean André Villeneuve
and Maurice Levasseur,


742
01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:08.520
replaced by the VP of sales
of a custom countertop company and…


743
01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:11.850
Listen, I had two weeks to file
the regulatory documents,


744
01:09:11.890 --> 01:09:14.270
so I called a few contacts in Magog.

745
01:09:14.310 --> 01:09:15.480
But I assure you…

746
01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:19.150
Mr. Lacroix, those nominations
still violate Article 2.4


747
01:09:19.190 --> 01:09:20.780
of your own code of ethics.

748
01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:23.820
Speaking of your code of ethics, it reads:

749
01:09:23.870 --> 01:09:28.200
"Norbourg managers are forbidden
from acquiring private equity."


750
01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:32.750
Yet, in July 2003, you personally
joined three hedge funds:


751
01:09:32.790 --> 01:09:34.880
Hedgevest
-Obligations, Global and…

752
01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:36.380
You're well-informed.

753
01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:40.760
It's true.
I did join a couple private funds.


754
01:09:41.630 --> 01:09:43.720
But I have a seven-figure income.

755
01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:46.100
I need a tax shelter that reflects that.

756
01:09:54.650 --> 01:09:56.230
THE NORBOURG MYSTERY

757
01:09:56.270 --> 01:09:59.900
"I have a seven-figure income.
I need a tax shelter that reflects that."


758
01:09:59.940 --> 01:10:02.200
Jesus, Vince! Why would you say that?

759
01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:03.700
Hey, fuck you!

760
01:10:04.660 --> 01:10:07.620
Like you would have done better.
He took me by surprise.


761
01:10:08.700 --> 01:10:13.500
"Norbourg is a mystery to several observers
in the financial world, competitors,


762
01:10:13.540 --> 01:10:17.250
"and even some of their advisors,
employees and business partners.


763
01:10:17.290 --> 01:10:19.750
How does the firm generate
the revenue needed…"


764
01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:20.960
Enough.

765
01:10:21.010 --> 01:10:22.970
"…for its acquisitions?"

766
01:10:24.090 --> 01:10:25.430
Hello?

767
01:10:27.140 --> 01:10:29.850
Fuck. Yeah, put him on.
I'll take it.


768
01:10:29.890 --> 01:10:31.680
The Desjardins manager.

769
01:10:33.850 --> 01:10:36.770
Hello! Yes, hi.

770
01:10:37.690 --> 01:10:39.690
Yes, we read it.

771
01:10:40.440 --> 01:10:43.650
Listen, that article is full of lies.

772
01:10:43.700 --> 01:10:45.820
I'll defend myself. 
I was misquoted.

773
01:10:46.950 --> 01:10:48.530
No, don't worry about it.

774
01:10:48.570 --> 01:10:51.660
It's a smear campaign
launched by people who are jealous.


775
01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:21.940
The money comes from
European sources, Switzerland.


776
01:11:22.570 --> 01:11:25.610
Listen, I can show you
the numbers if you want,


777
01:11:25.650 --> 01:11:28.660
but I thought we were operating on trust.

778
01:11:30.620 --> 01:11:32.450
I'm disappointed to see that

779
01:11:32.490 --> 01:11:36.620
that rag was enough
to make you question our collaboration.


780
01:11:37.290 --> 01:11:40.630
You could show us the numbers, Mr. Lacroix.

781
01:11:40.670 --> 01:11:42.710
But that's not the only issue.

782
01:11:42.750 --> 01:11:43.840
Listen…

783
01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:46.930
Anyway, we don't have to justify ourselves.

784
01:11:46.970 --> 01:11:48.760
You said it perfectly, Mr. Lacroix.

785
01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:52.560
Here at Desjardins,
we operate on trust.


786
01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:54.390
When in doubt,

787
01:11:54.430 --> 01:11:58.060
we prefer to withdraw our funds
for the good of our members.


788
01:11:58.100 --> 01:12:01.230
Hang on. I can provide you with…

789
01:12:01.270 --> 01:12:03.070
According to your statements…

790
01:12:03.110 --> 01:12:06.280
And they're your statements,
so they must be true.


791
01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:10.700
We have just over $22.4 million
under management with you.


792
01:12:11.620 --> 01:12:13.410
We'd like that money back.

793
01:12:20.420 --> 01:12:21.830
Martin…

794
01:12:22.840 --> 01:12:25.760
I'll let you work out the terms.

795
01:12:36.270 --> 01:12:38.430
Norbourg, hello! Please hold.

796
01:12:38.890 --> 01:12:41.560
Norbourg, hello! Please hold.

797
01:12:51.110 --> 01:12:54.660
<i>OK, Vincent, I think it's time
you made a voluntary tax disclosure</i>


798
01:12:54.700 --> 01:12:56.040
<i>to calm suspicions.</i>

799
01:12:56.080 --> 01:12:57.620
No, that would prove them right.

800
01:12:57.660 --> 01:13:00.870
It's the only way to clear your name.
Can't you see?


801
01:13:00.920 --> 01:13:05.800
I feel like we should retaliate right away
and go after them.


802
01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:08.920
I agree with Vince.
They have to make a retraction.


803
01:13:08.970 --> 01:13:12.800
Problem is everything they wrote is true.
That's the fucking problem!


804
01:13:18.270 --> 01:13:21.940
Vincent, you have to keep a low profile,
'cause there's something else.


805
01:13:22.350 --> 01:13:23.400
What?

806
01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:27.360
Surprise, my contacts told me the Authority
is still investigating Norbourg.


807
01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:29.320
They won't fucking back down!

808
01:14:14.660 --> 01:14:19.540
Also, I can't be
at the KPMG meeting tomorrow.


809
01:14:21.500 --> 01:14:23.040
Why not?

810
01:14:23.460 --> 01:14:25.540
A little emergency in Beauport.

811
01:14:25.580 --> 01:14:27.210
Davila will fill in for me.

812
01:14:28.540 --> 01:14:30.920
Hey, nice timing.

813
01:14:32.010 --> 01:14:36.180
It's the little consulting firm
I started a couple years ago.


814
01:14:36.220 --> 01:14:38.180
You're fucking me over too?

815
01:14:38.220 --> 01:14:42.430
No, not at all.
I'm not fucking you over.


816
01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:44.440
It's a sideline I'm trying to develop.

817
01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:45.520
A sideline?

818
01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:49.033
You signed an exclusivity deal,
may I remind you.


819
01:14:49.980 --> 01:14:52.990
It's a consulting firm.
It's a whole different game.


820
01:14:53.990 --> 01:14:56.660
Come on, Vince.
You know I'll never run Norbourg.


821
01:14:56.700 --> 01:14:59.240
It's normal that I want to
do my own thing.


822
01:15:02.500 --> 01:15:04.790
I'm gonna be short staffed in mutual funds.

823
01:15:04.830 --> 01:15:08.840
I know. I already approached someone.
Give me a couple days.


824
01:15:28.230 --> 01:15:30.570
What's on the table…

825
01:15:32.860 --> 01:15:36.320
is the position of
VP of compliance, special projects.


826
01:15:38.360 --> 01:15:41.410
That's fifth from the top
in the company hierarchy.


827
01:15:52.710 --> 01:15:56.050
Listen, I don't know what to say.

828
01:15:56.090 --> 01:15:58.510
I might be interested.

829
01:15:58.550 --> 01:16:01.430
I've gone as high as
I'm gonna go at work.

830
01:16:01.470 --> 01:16:04.770
Look it over carefully.
There's no rush.


831
01:16:04.810 --> 01:16:06.560
We can answer your questions.

832
01:16:10.020 --> 01:16:13.570
Well, I only have one question for you.

833
01:16:13.610 --> 01:16:14.980
Shoot.

834
01:16:16.570 --> 01:16:18.820
Is Norbourg on the straight and narrow?

835
01:16:19.490 --> 01:16:22.530
I'm gonna be completely
honest with you, Éric,


836
01:16:22.580 --> 01:16:24.660
because I'm hearing all kinds of things.

837
01:16:24.700 --> 01:16:27.370
Those are just rumors, Julien,
and you know it.


838
01:16:28.540 --> 01:16:32.380
A lot of people had a tough time
in the bear market after September 11.


839
01:16:32.420 --> 01:16:36.050
We happened to come out on top.
It happens, right?


840
01:16:37.050 --> 01:16:39.590
They're jealous.
What do you want me to say?


841
01:16:41.220 --> 01:16:44.220
Trust me, you'll have free rein
in your new position.


842
01:17:12.750 --> 01:17:13.880
Yeah?

843
01:17:17.010 --> 01:17:18.300
How's it going?

844
01:17:19.010 --> 01:17:21.590
Getting settled in OK?

845
01:17:21.630 --> 01:17:23.300
Yeah, yeah.

846
01:17:25.510 --> 01:17:28.560
There's a problem here.

847
01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:31.600
I can't seem to reconcile
funds received from clients


848
01:17:31.640 --> 01:17:34.440
with the amounts in investment funds.

849
01:17:35.020 --> 01:17:38.320
Éric, there are no internal procedures.

850
01:17:38.740 --> 01:17:41.200
No control systems.

851
01:17:43.320 --> 01:17:45.240
Well, sort it out, Julien.

852
01:17:45.780 --> 01:17:49.200
Look, I know it's chaotic.
We've grown so much in two years.


853
01:17:49.950 --> 01:17:52.750
Figure something out.
Sorry, I have to go.


854
01:17:53.580 --> 01:17:54.750
But…

855
01:17:58.953 --> 01:18:01.630
Jesus, Vincent.
Don't you answer your cell?


856
01:18:01.670 --> 01:18:02.880
What's going on?

857
01:18:02.930 --> 01:18:05.680
The Authority blocked the MCA transaction.

858
01:18:05.720 --> 01:18:08.850
Fucking hell! The stock exchange
approved it two weeks ago.


859
01:18:08.890 --> 01:18:10.980
I thought it was settled.

860
01:18:12.270 --> 01:18:13.390
Excuse me, Éric, but…

861
01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:15.400
- Give me a minute.
- I really need…


862
01:18:20.150 --> 01:18:21.570
Won't be long.

863
01:18:24.070 --> 01:18:25.200
What did they say?

864
01:18:25.240 --> 01:18:28.620
Nothing. No explanation,
and there's no one to talk to.


865
01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:31.040
Fuck! We look like idiots.

866
01:18:31.790 --> 01:18:33.920
Hang on, Vincent.

867
01:18:34.460 --> 01:18:36.630
We got a subpoena this morning.

868
01:18:41.130 --> 01:18:45.930
They're going to investigate our funding
for the acquisitions of the past few years


869
01:18:45.970 --> 01:18:49.310
and Vincent Lacroix's
personal sources of funding.


870
01:18:52.100 --> 01:18:54.520
Let them try. They won't get me!

871
01:18:59.770 --> 01:19:01.320
There are many advantages.

872
01:19:01.360 --> 01:19:05.660
By choosing mutual funds,
you benefit from professional management.


873
01:19:05.700 --> 01:19:08.660
Here, for example,
a dedicated fund manager


874
01:19:08.700 --> 01:19:12.750
chooses the best investments
and monitors the market for his clients.


875
01:19:12.790 --> 01:19:14.210
He's a natural.

876
01:19:14.250 --> 01:19:17.710
Another advantage is privileged access
to these markets.


877
01:19:17.750 --> 01:19:21.800
Because mutual funds offer clear,
personalized access


878
01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:24.720
tailored to your tolerance for risk.

879
01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:27.180
How's it going
with the voluntary disclosure?


880
01:19:27.220 --> 01:19:29.800
Don't worry about the voluntary disclosure.

881
01:19:29.850 --> 01:19:32.390
There are more pressing matters at hand.

882
01:19:50.370 --> 01:19:51.830
Hi.

883
01:19:56.750 --> 01:19:58.120
Gentlemen…

884
01:20:05.380 --> 01:20:06.760
What's this?

885
01:20:08.180 --> 01:20:10.680
SUMMONS TO APPEAR

886
01:20:11.220 --> 01:20:13.350
You need a lawyer, Éric.

887
01:20:13.810 --> 01:20:16.520
It's nothing.
They always ask the same questions.


888
01:20:16.560 --> 01:20:20.690
Éric, Norbourg's future is at stake.
Get a lawyer.


889
01:20:26.110 --> 01:20:28.280
But don't worry about it.

890
01:20:35.540 --> 01:20:38.960
The lawyer says
there's nothing to worry about.


891
01:20:40.210 --> 01:20:43.920
Obviously, you're not the one testifying.

892
01:20:44.590 --> 01:20:48.840
They didn't have anything before,
but it seems they do now.


893
01:20:58.390 --> 01:21:01.770
Vincent, you know
I'm compromising myself for you.


894
01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:07.820
I'm the one lying under oath here.

895
01:21:08.860 --> 01:21:10.740
What do you mean, lying?

896
01:21:10.780 --> 01:21:11.910
Come on.

897
01:21:11.950 --> 01:21:15.450
Embellishment, omissions,
gaps in memory…


898
01:21:15.490 --> 01:21:17.620
Call it what you want.

899
01:21:20.120 --> 01:21:21.540
Goddammit!

900
01:21:21.580 --> 01:21:24.630
You're not lowering
your handicap this year, huh?


901
01:21:24.670 --> 01:21:27.380
You know my position
is becoming untenable.


902
01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:34.140
I appreciate your loyalty, Éric.

903
01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:39.230
Is there anything I can do for you?

904
01:21:39.850 --> 01:21:44.770
Well, I have my sights set
on a little house in Beauport.


905
01:21:46.400 --> 01:21:48.230
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.


906
01:21:49.240 --> 01:21:51.240
I'd like to make an offer.

907
01:21:56.410 --> 01:21:58.160
OK, spit it out.

908
01:22:00.660 --> 01:22:05.290
I'll just need a $330,000 check
made out to a notary trust account.


909
01:22:10.340 --> 01:22:14.010
You can pick it up
at Bernier's office Monday.


910
01:22:23.690 --> 01:22:25.610
<i>Asselin, today's interrogation,</i>

911
01:22:25.650 --> 01:22:26.860
held on June 15, 2005,

912
01:22:26.900 --> 01:22:31.190
follows the interrogations
held April 27 and 28, 2005.


913
01:22:31.240 --> 01:22:32.780
You were summoned by a subpoena.

914
01:22:32.820 --> 01:22:35.740
You are entitled to
the same rights and protections.


915
01:22:35.780 --> 01:22:37.120
Do you understand?

916
01:22:37.160 --> 01:22:38.490
I do.

917
01:22:39.910 --> 01:22:42.330
I'm looking at today's agenda,

918
01:22:42.370 --> 01:22:47.090
and orders 13, 14, 32, 40, 65,

919
01:22:47.130 --> 01:22:50.170
83, 84 and 98

920
01:22:50.210 --> 01:22:52.920
were not discussed with my client.

921
01:22:52.970 --> 01:22:55.050
Mr. Asselin is ready to respond to

922
01:22:55.090 --> 01:22:59.810
orders 40, 83 and 84 this morning.

923
01:22:59.850 --> 01:23:03.480
We can agree there are two categories:

924
01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:07.650
those that specifically touch on
documents or information


925
01:23:07.690 --> 01:23:10.110
my client is personally aware of.

926
01:23:10.610 --> 01:23:15.700
The others should be addressed
to Mr. Lacroix or Norbourg.


927
01:23:16.070 --> 01:23:18.910
Where are you going with this?

928
01:23:20.080 --> 01:23:23.000
Well, until now,
we haven't made a distinction.


929
01:23:23.040 --> 01:23:25.250
But I must inform you that my client

930
01:23:25.290 --> 01:23:29.540
will no longer answer questions
relating to these orders.


931
01:23:29.590 --> 01:23:32.670
You should ask Mr. 
Lacroix these questions.

932
01:23:33.920 --> 01:23:35.720
That's up to your discretion.

933
01:23:36.630 --> 01:23:39.550
Mr. Asselin, I'll ask you to consult

934
01:23:39.600 --> 01:23:43.680
the Norbourg financial statement for 2003.

935
01:24:19.390 --> 01:24:21.890
What other animal can
I have in my house?

936
01:24:21.930 --> 01:24:24.350
Maybe chickens?
What sound do chickens make?


937
01:24:25.930 --> 01:24:27.060
They go…

938
01:25:10.980 --> 01:25:16.070
I feel like we've barely spoken
since you met with the Authority.


939
01:25:16.110 --> 01:25:18.110
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.

940
01:25:18.150 --> 01:25:21.700
I've been busy
with my business in Beauport.


941
01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:24.830
But there's nothing new.

942
01:25:25.200 --> 01:25:28.580
They're asking the same questions
in different ways.


943
01:25:28.620 --> 01:25:29.790
Don't worry about it.

944
01:25:30.670 --> 01:25:35.170
Well, the matter obviously isn't settled,
because I got a summons to appear.


945
01:25:35.210 --> 01:25:36.710
Oh yeah?

946
01:25:37.260 --> 01:25:41.340
Of course, the questions
got more and more specific.


947
01:25:41.380 --> 01:25:44.050
From before my time,
stuff I had nothing to do with.


948
01:25:44.100 --> 01:25:48.430
Maybe Kingsley thought it would be better
if you answered instead of me,


949
01:25:48.470 --> 01:25:50.440
so we don't get mixed up or something.

950
01:25:50.480 --> 01:25:54.400
Yeah, we have to get our stories straight
so we don't contradict each other.


951
01:25:54.810 --> 01:25:58.070
We won't contradict each other.
I haven't strayed from my story.


952
01:26:00.070 --> 01:26:01.150
Vincent,

953
01:26:01.820 --> 01:26:05.660
I know Norbourg
is going through a tough time.


954
01:26:05.700 --> 01:26:08.290
You'll get through it. 
You always do.

955
01:26:08.330 --> 01:26:10.330
<i>"You'll</i>get through it?"

956
01:26:11.960 --> 01:26:15.540
<i>We'll</i>get through it.
I'm with you 100%.


957
01:26:16.540 --> 01:26:18.460
Don't worry. I'm on it.

958
01:26:18.500 --> 01:26:21.800
Bernier gave me an update
on your voluntary disclosure.


959
01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:24.300
It's ironclad. 
It'll shut them up.

960
01:26:27.890 --> 01:26:31.350
Think you'll have more time
for the office these days?


961
01:26:32.190 --> 01:26:34.730
I'm not sure about Giguère. It's like…

962
01:26:35.610 --> 01:26:37.020
He doesn't fit in.

963
01:26:37.070 --> 01:26:39.570
We'll keep an eye on him. Don't worry.

964
01:26:40.990 --> 01:26:42.070
See you Monday.

965
01:27:40.920 --> 01:27:43.550
Listen, this is some story
you're telling us.


966
01:27:43.590 --> 01:27:45.010
Yeah.

967
01:27:46.050 --> 01:27:50.310
When did you decide
to report what you discovered?


968
01:27:50.350 --> 01:27:51.970
A few days ago.

969
01:27:53.140 --> 01:27:55.940
When I found the irregularities…

970
01:27:56.560 --> 01:28:00.270
I got worried, so
I came to see you.

971
01:28:02.570 --> 01:28:07.030
Like I told you, it took a while to get
a clear understanding of the situation.


972
01:28:08.950 --> 01:28:13.080
At first, I found the custodian's
business structure very complex,


973
01:28:13.120 --> 01:28:14.340
a lot of intermediaries.

974
01:28:14.353 --> 01:28:17.620
I started asking questions,
and he told me that's how it works,


975
01:28:17.670 --> 01:28:19.460
that it's always been that way.

976
01:28:20.080 --> 01:28:21.630
Who?

977
01:28:23.590 --> 01:28:25.260
Vincent Lacroix.

978
01:28:26.170 --> 01:28:28.550
Then I discovered how he hid it.

979
01:28:29.340 --> 01:28:31.010
OK, let's go back a little.

980
01:28:31.050 --> 01:28:35.270
How exactly did you find out
the Molton Trust statements were falsified?


981
01:28:36.140 --> 01:28:39.020
I saw a real one
I wasn't supposed to see.

982
01:28:39.060 --> 01:28:40.770
The discrepancy was huge.

983
01:28:40.810 --> 01:28:45.440
When I explain the system used
to tamper with the reports,


984
01:28:45.490 --> 01:28:49.860
the false numbers
I unknowingly sent to investors,


985
01:28:49.910 --> 01:28:52.740
you'll see just how well
it was all organized.


986
01:28:53.160 --> 01:28:54.990
We have all the time in the world.

987
01:28:56.040 --> 01:28:57.410
Yeah.

988
01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:08.970
<i>Exchange-traded funds, or ETFs,
are a good way to diversify your portfolio.</i>


989
01:29:09.010 --> 01:29:12.930
<i>So for more conservative investors,</i>

990
01:29:12.970 --> 01:29:17.230
<i>numerous ETFs specialize
in low-volatility stocks,</i>


991
01:29:17.270 --> 01:29:20.810
<i>bonds, government bonds,
the S&amp;P 500, etcetera.</i>


992
01:29:21.270 --> 01:29:26.190
<i>What would you tell viewers at home
wondering how to invest in ETFs?</i>


993
01:29:26.650 --> 01:29:31.490
<i>I'd tell any first-time investor listening</i>

994
01:29:31.530 --> 01:29:33.320
<i>not to do it alone.</i>

995
01:29:33.370 --> 01:29:34.830
<i>Work with an advisor.</i>

996
01:29:35.450 --> 01:29:40.040
<i>Your advisor can invest
in an ETF in your name.</i>


997
01:29:59.020 --> 01:30:02.100
TRANSFERRING FILES

998
01:30:39.220 --> 01:30:41.060
You have a lot of reading to do.

999
01:30:41.100 --> 01:30:43.310
You can draw your own conclusions.

1000
01:30:45.270 --> 01:30:48.690
So what do I do now?

1001
01:30:49.150 --> 01:30:52.240
Until we have enough proof, you stay put.

1002
01:30:53.780 --> 01:30:56.200
I have to get more information?

1003
01:30:57.080 --> 01:31:01.000
You're asking me to go
from witness to double agent.


1004
01:31:30.780 --> 01:31:33.190
How much in total?

1005
01:31:33.240 --> 01:31:35.240
Seems like it's over everywhere.

1006
01:31:35.280 --> 01:31:38.450
It's more than we thought,
but I think we can absorb it.


1007
01:31:41.410 --> 01:31:42.870
How much?

1008
01:31:44.750 --> 01:31:48.170
If we go with scenario A,
to be safe,


1009
01:31:48.210 --> 01:31:51.840
Norbourg should disclose
a sum of about $63 million.


1010
01:31:52.260 --> 01:31:56.430
So we'd have to pay about $21.3 million

1011
01:31:56.470 --> 01:31:58.600
in federal and provincial taxes.

1012
01:31:58.640 --> 01:32:00.010
$21 million?

1013
01:32:01.100 --> 01:32:04.060
Jesus Christ!
At first, Éric said $12 million.


1014
01:32:04.100 --> 01:32:06.890
Luc, you told me $14 million.
Now I'm at $21 million?


1015
01:32:06.940 --> 01:32:09.440
What the fuck?
That's practically double!


1016
01:32:09.480 --> 01:32:11.150
Yeah.

1017
01:32:11.190 --> 01:32:15.280
With that, Vince,
we're buying peace for five years.


1018
01:32:45.890 --> 01:32:47.390
Thank you.

1019
01:33:34.520 --> 01:33:35.900
Listen…

1020
01:33:37.860 --> 01:33:39.650
I asked you here tonight…

1021
01:33:40.910 --> 01:33:43.160
because you're all important players.

1022
01:33:44.660 --> 01:33:46.660
You stayed loyal.

1023
01:33:49.160 --> 01:33:53.420
Look, I'd like to offer everyone
a stake in Norbourg.


1024
01:33:54.130 --> 01:33:58.260
But I don't know how to divide it.

1025
01:33:59.800 --> 01:34:01.760
I don't want any fighting.

1026
01:34:01.800 --> 01:34:03.600
So…

1027
01:34:05.640 --> 01:34:10.730
I've decided to give everyone a fixed sum.

1028
01:34:12.400 --> 01:34:13.770
To thank you.

1029
01:34:15.320 --> 01:34:17.070
For your loyalty.

1030
01:34:27.540 --> 01:34:29.040
Excuse me.

1031
01:35:00.570 --> 01:35:03.450
It's a first draft
of my analysis of the situation.


1032
01:35:04.950 --> 01:35:08.330
I can continue my analysis, but…

1033
01:35:09.290 --> 01:35:11.040
I need certain guarantees.

1034
01:35:12.290 --> 01:35:13.580
We're listening.

1035
01:35:14.210 --> 01:35:17.590
I want full immunity
against any potential legal action.


1036
01:35:18.366 --> 01:35:20.000
I want physical protection,

1037
01:35:20.050 --> 01:35:23.630
'cause I won't make any friends
spilling dirt on Norbourg.


1038
01:35:24.840 --> 01:35:28.720
I want a permanent position
in public service and $1 million.


1039
01:35:29.220 --> 01:35:31.020
Listen, Asselin…

1040
01:35:31.060 --> 01:35:32.730
Those are quite the demands.

1041
01:35:33.140 --> 01:35:35.770
We don't have the authority
to settle that here.


1042
01:35:37.730 --> 01:35:41.940
Well, hurry,
'cause he's burning through the cash.


1043
01:35:43.530 --> 01:35:46.820
He just spent $2.6 million
on an inn in Magog.


1044
01:35:46.860 --> 01:35:49.580
He bought the Grand Café
for $750,000 cash.


1045
01:35:49.620 --> 01:35:51.660
And he's about to buy Chez Parée!

1046
01:35:55.160 --> 01:35:57.460
He wants to give me $900,000.

1047
01:35:57.500 --> 01:35:59.210
He says it's for past services.

1048
01:35:59.250 --> 01:36:02.760
He's doing the same
for Bernier, Davila and Bilodeau!


1049
01:36:05.260 --> 01:36:08.600
He's trying to compromise them
and buy their loyalty.


1050
01:36:08.640 --> 01:36:11.060
So what do I do?
Do I take the check?


1051
01:36:11.100 --> 01:36:13.430
Or I give it to you to deposit?

1052
01:36:13.470 --> 01:36:16.640
Well, we can't tell you what to do.

1053
01:36:17.310 --> 01:36:21.190
Well, that's too bad then,
but I'm not showing my face there again.


1054
01:36:24.280 --> 01:36:28.410
If you choke, the little deal
you're trying to negotiate…


1055
01:36:34.200 --> 01:36:38.290
Was there anyone at the firm before you
who can corroborate your story?


1056
01:36:38.710 --> 01:36:40.170
I don't know.

1057
01:36:41.090 --> 01:36:42.800
Well, think.

1058
01:36:47.430 --> 01:36:49.640
And to help you think, Éric,

1059
01:36:49.680 --> 01:36:53.430
we learned you received
some very generous bonuses in February.


1060
01:36:55.480 --> 01:36:58.980
If you want to take that road,
I can just go to the cops.


1061
01:36:59.020 --> 01:37:02.110
I want compensation.
That's non-negotiable!


1062
01:37:02.860 --> 01:37:06.190
Without me,
you wouldn't know squat about Norbourg.


1063
01:37:20.040 --> 01:37:24.960
I have here a written confirmation
from the IMET


1064
01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:29.720
that nothing in your statements to us
and no documents you've provided


1065
01:37:29.760 --> 01:37:31.840
will be used against you.

1066
01:37:33.350 --> 01:37:36.220
You think I'm gonna negotiate
with a gun to my head?


1067
01:37:36.680 --> 01:37:39.100
No, this isn't a negotiation.

1068
01:37:39.810 --> 01:37:41.650
It's our final offer.

1069
01:37:42.520 --> 01:37:45.110
You don't have to sign it,

1070
01:37:45.150 --> 01:37:49.530
but if I were you,
I'd sign it, and fast.


1071
01:37:50.700 --> 01:37:53.780
You know, we looked into you closely.

1072
01:37:55.120 --> 01:37:56.330
Bullshit!

1073
01:37:56.370 --> 01:37:57.540
Fine.

1074
01:37:58.580 --> 01:38:01.920
If you want, we could look into
the fascinating file


1075
01:38:01.960 --> 01:38:06.750
on your brand-new little castle
on Harfang Street in Beauport,


1076
01:38:06.800 --> 01:38:09.220
paid for in cash on June 7.

1077
01:38:53.760 --> 01:38:56.720
No matter what way I look at it,

1078
01:38:56.760 --> 01:39:01.430
I can't figure out how so much cash
just drops into the company coffers.


1079
01:39:01.480 --> 01:39:05.480
Listen, with Norbourg International,
the Bahamas,


1080
01:39:05.520 --> 01:39:09.690
it's gotten so complex that
only Vincent really knows how it works.


1081
01:39:09.730 --> 01:39:12.490
Well, I have to understand
where the funds come from,


1082
01:39:12.530 --> 01:39:14.570
'cause we can all see how they're spent.

1083
01:39:14.610 --> 01:39:17.740
Private jets,
offices all over the province,


1084
01:39:17.780 --> 01:39:19.120
box seats at the hockey stadium…

1085
01:39:19.160 --> 01:39:23.040
Vincent can't spend like this forever.
We'll hit a wall.


1086
01:39:24.766 --> 01:39:29.300
Has it ever crossed your mind that
maybe Vincent is financing acquisitions


1087
01:39:29.340 --> 01:39:31.670
by dipping into the investment funds?

1088
01:39:31.710 --> 01:39:35.180
Of course not. 
There's no way.

1089
01:39:35.220 --> 01:39:37.100
Norbourg is too scrutinized.

1090
01:39:37.930 --> 01:39:39.810
I don't know, Éric.

1091
01:39:40.680 --> 01:39:42.180
I don't want to believe it,

1092
01:39:42.230 --> 01:39:46.350
but I've got Bernier saying I'll never see
the books at Norbourg International.


1093
01:39:47.480 --> 01:39:49.020
I'll talk to him.

1094
01:39:58.030 --> 01:39:59.530
Don't worry.

1095
01:40:00.160 --> 01:40:03.330
I repeat, the accounts are fine.

1096
01:40:09.540 --> 01:40:12.710
Luc, could I please

1097
01:40:12.760 --> 01:40:17.800
have access to all the accounts
for every branch of Norbourg?


1098
01:40:21.220 --> 01:40:22.720
Jesus Christ!

1099
01:40:26.310 --> 01:40:28.730
I'm VP of compliance.

1100
01:40:28.770 --> 01:40:32.440
So if I want to see the accounts,
you show me the accounts.


1101
01:40:32.480 --> 01:40:33.900
Is that clear?

1102
01:40:36.200 --> 01:40:38.360
Over my dead body.

1103
01:40:56.300 --> 01:41:00.890
Francis, I want access
to the Norbourg International accounts.


1104
01:41:02.430 --> 01:41:03.850
Give him the codes.

1105
01:41:09.560 --> 01:41:11.270
Log me in.

1106
01:41:11.310 --> 01:41:12.690
Log me into the NAI account,

1107
01:41:12.730 --> 01:41:15.490
account 23-01-34-16
at the Bank of Montreal.


1108
01:41:15.530 --> 01:41:16.780
Go.

1109
01:41:25.540 --> 01:41:27.960
Could you give us a moment, Francis?

1110
01:41:38.630 --> 01:41:40.090
OK…

1111
01:41:55.110 --> 01:41:56.860
Jesus…

1112
01:41:58.780 --> 01:42:03.160
The transfers are from the Evolution Fund,
Unicyme and Canadian Equity.


1113
01:42:04.580 --> 01:42:06.740
The money shouldn't be transferred there.

1114
01:42:06.790 --> 01:42:09.660
Investor dollars
should be in trust accounts,


1115
01:42:09.710 --> 01:42:11.920
not at Norbourg International!

1116
01:42:16.550 --> 01:42:17.920
What's this?

1117
01:42:18.510 --> 01:42:23.760
Over $6 million sent to
Vincent Lacroix's account on July 22.


1118
01:42:31.390 --> 01:42:35.820
It's the first $6 million payment
for his voluntary disclosure.


1119
01:42:35.860 --> 01:42:37.400
That's where he got it.

1120
01:42:42.240 --> 01:42:45.700
Asselin, this is fucking crazy!

1121
01:42:48.870 --> 01:42:51.920
We absolutely have to
report this to the Authority.


1122
01:42:53.670 --> 01:42:56.380
Let's go to my office. Come.

1123
01:43:07.220 --> 01:43:09.810
Bilodeau! Come.

1124
01:43:14.190 --> 01:43:15.940
Shut the door, please.

1125
01:43:20.360 --> 01:43:23.660
Éric, it's fucking millions!
We have to stop it.


1126
01:43:23.700 --> 01:43:25.110
Calm down. Sit.

1127
01:43:32.540 --> 01:43:36.580
You have to go to the RCMP,
not the Authority.


1128
01:43:38.840 --> 01:43:40.710
We're in contact with them.

1129
01:43:48.930 --> 01:43:52.520
What's happening here is madness.
I just found out.


1130
01:43:55.730 --> 01:43:58.770
Yes, Mr. Brunetta. 
It's Éric Asselin.

1131
01:43:58.820 --> 01:44:01.230
I have another colleague ready to talk.

1132
01:45:46.090 --> 01:45:47.940
You looking for someone?

1133
01:45:52.640 --> 01:45:55.930
Giguère isn't here today.
Apparently, he called in sick.


1134
01:45:56.520 --> 01:45:57.930
I don't know.

1135
01:45:59.850 --> 01:46:04.650
Listen, we got the loan agreement documents
from Dominion Investments.


1136
01:46:05.730 --> 01:46:07.860
Send them over. 
I'll take care of it.

1137
01:46:51.320 --> 01:46:52.990
This here…

1138
01:46:54.820 --> 01:46:56.490
is the 12th floor.

1139
01:46:59.200 --> 01:47:03.630
Bilodeau's office, 
Bernier's office…

1140
01:47:06.540 --> 01:47:08.300
and Vincent Lacroix's.

1141
01:47:10.130 --> 01:47:12.010
You need a code to get in.

1142
01:47:12.630 --> 01:47:16.350
There are a lot of files in there
you'd find very interesting.


1143
01:47:17.640 --> 01:47:20.520
I've rarely seen such a proactive witness.

1144
01:47:25.060 --> 01:47:27.480
I've held up my end of the deal.

1145
01:47:27.940 --> 01:47:30.990
Can I at least know
when you'll move in?


1146
01:47:31.030 --> 01:47:33.860
I'd rather not be around that day.

1147
01:47:37.030 --> 01:47:40.200
If I were you, I'd stay away
from the office later this week.


1148
01:47:47.170 --> 01:47:52.050
THURSDAY, AUGUST 25, 2005

1149
01:48:40.220 --> 01:48:41.430
Hold up your plate.

1150
01:48:46.600 --> 01:48:48.520
You'll make the next one.

1151
01:49:18.300 --> 01:49:21.100
Yeah. Thank you for coming.

1152
01:50:12.110 --> 01:50:15.860
RCMP! All employees,
please exit your offices immediately.


1153
01:50:15.900 --> 01:50:17.110
No one touch a thing!

1154
01:50:17.150 --> 01:50:18.320
RCMP?

1155
01:50:18.860 --> 01:50:22.700
Put down your document.

1156
01:50:24.830 --> 01:50:27.330
Sir, I'll ask you to
please put down that file.


1157
01:50:33.290 --> 01:50:35.750
Step away from your desk.

1158
01:51:01.820 --> 01:51:05.160
<i>Very bad news today
for thousands of small investors.</i>


1159
01:51:05.200 --> 01:51:09.000
<i>We all know how hard it is
to grow your savings for retirement.</i>


1160
01:51:09.040 --> 01:51:12.920
<i>A major fraud was uncovered
at Montreal company, Norbourg,</i>


1161
01:51:12.960 --> 01:51:15.290
<i>a large investment fund manager.</i>

1162
01:51:15.340 --> 01:51:19.590
<i>Yves, the company led by Vincent Lacroix
is alleged to have embezzled $70 million?</i>


1163
01:51:19.630 --> 01:51:20.670
<i>That's right.</i>

1164
01:51:20.720 --> 01:51:26.100
<i>The AMF, assisted by the RCMP
and provincial police,</i>


1165
01:51:26.140 --> 01:51:29.390
<i>investigated the notorious Vincent Lacroix.</i>

1166
01:51:58.040 --> 01:52:00.130
<i>…from December 31, 2004.</i>

1167
01:52:00.170 --> 01:52:04.180
<i>The company claimed to have $155 million,</i>

1168
01:52:04.220 --> 01:52:06.970
<i>when they in fact had $85.</i>

1169
01:52:07.010 --> 01:52:11.640
I have to present myself as another
fraud victim like the other investors.


1170
01:52:11.680 --> 01:52:14.690
<i>…false financial statements
for the past three years,</i>


1171
01:52:14.730 --> 01:52:17.690
<i>fabrication and falsification
of documents,</i>


1172
01:52:17.730 --> 01:52:21.610
<i>embezzlement,
at least 5,000 investors defrauded.</i>


1173
01:52:21.650 --> 01:52:24.740
<i>Pierre, it could be as high as 10,000.</i>

1174
01:52:24.780 --> 01:52:26.110
It's my only chance.

1175
01:52:27.030 --> 01:52:31.540
<i>Over 5,000 investors,
clients of Norbourg,</i>


1176
01:52:31.580 --> 01:52:35.580
<i>are wondering if they've
lost their entire investments.</i>


1177
01:52:35.620 --> 01:52:41.340
<i>The AMF is accusing the company
of embezzling $70 million</i>


1178
01:52:41.380 --> 01:52:44.300
<i>and has ordered them
to cease all activities.</i>


1179
01:52:44.340 --> 01:52:47.010
<i>Criminal charges may be filed…</i>

1180
01:53:17.500 --> 01:53:20.000
<i>After many long years before the courts,</i>

1181
01:53:20.040 --> 01:53:23.000
<i>after several attempted
class-action lawsuits,</i>


1182
01:53:23.050 --> 01:53:25.590
<i>the 9,200 investors swindled by Norbourg</i>

1183
01:53:25.630 --> 01:53:29.390
<i>failed to recover
their entire original investments.</i>


1184
01:53:29.430 --> 01:53:31.300
<i>Some were ruined.</i>

1185
01:54:32.700 --> 01:54:35.950
<i>Found guilty of fraud
on an unprecedented scale</i>


1186
01:54:35.990 --> 01:54:37.790
<i>in Quebec judicial history,</i>

1187

<i>Vincent Lacroix still served
less than three years in prison.</i>


1188
01:55:04.020 --> 01:55:10.530
<i>He is now free and rebuilding his life.</i>

1189
01:55:12.280 --> 01:55:15.740
<i>As for Éric Asselin,
he did not stand trial</i>

1190
01:55:15.780 --> 01:55:19.950
<i>and was not convicted
in the Norbourg scandal.</i>


1191
01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:24.130
<i>He was, however,
found guilty of bankruptcy fraud in 2013.</i>
