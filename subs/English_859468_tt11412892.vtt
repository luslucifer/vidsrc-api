NETFLIX PRESENTS

2
00:00:18.633 --> 00:00:25.383
A FILM CO-FINANCED
BY THE POLISH FILM ART INSTITUTE


3
00:00:25.925 --> 00:00:32.425
LIFE IN THE LIMELIGHT!
KALINA JĘDRUSIK REVEALS SECRETS


4
00:02:24.591 --> 00:02:29.383
THE EVENTS DEPICTED IN THIS FILM
DID NOT NECESSARILY HAPPEN


5
00:03:00.133 --> 00:03:05.341
The 1960s woman,
she should be stylish yet modest.


6
00:03:05.425 --> 00:03:08.425
- Mmm.
- Flamboyant yet modest.


7
00:03:08.508 --> 00:03:10.883
- Yeah.
- Chic yet modest.


8
00:03:10.966 --> 00:03:13.758
And always devoted to hearth and home.

9
00:03:24.883 --> 00:03:26.175
Gabardine.

10
00:03:26.258 --> 00:03:27.258
Moire.

11
00:03:27.675 --> 00:03:28.716
Crimplene.

12
00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:29.800
Taffeta.

13
00:03:29.883 --> 00:03:31.341
And damask.

14
00:03:49.841 --> 00:03:51.841
Whoa.

15
00:04:12.175 --> 00:04:14.192
- Don't step on the cracks.
- Careful!


16
00:04:17.425 --> 00:04:19.442
All right, give me the keys.

17
00:04:19.466 --> 00:04:20.966
Mmm. Mmm.

18
00:04:22.258 --> 00:04:25.508
Oh God. I wonder
where did I put them.

19
00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.383
- Come on.
- Wait. Oh, fuck it!


20
00:04:29.466 --> 00:04:31.633
For God's sake!

21
00:04:32.175 --> 00:04:33.591
Have you got a torch?

22
00:04:33.675 --> 00:04:35.550
Funnily, not.

23
00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.383
I've got a lighter.

24
00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:46.508
Give it here, will you?

25
00:04:47.133 --> 00:04:49.550
Right. Hang on.

26
00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:53.883
For fuck's sake, Staś,
you're gonna set my hair on fire.


27
00:04:53.966 --> 00:04:54.966
Watch it.

28
00:04:55.591 --> 00:04:58.800
Ugh! Oh God, I've lost them again.

29
00:04:58.883 --> 00:04:59.883
Magda!

30
00:05:00.425 --> 00:05:01.633
Magda!

31
00:05:03.341 --> 00:05:05.508
Well, if it isn't
Ms Young Jędrusik!


32
00:05:05.591 --> 00:05:07.258
What's all this noise about?

33
00:05:07.341 --> 00:05:09.383
We've lost our keys, 
Mrs Klimczakowa.

34
00:05:09.466 --> 00:05:12.675
Why are you yelling outside my window?
You'll wake everybody up.


35
00:05:12.758 --> 00:05:15.091
Why are you being so horrid?
Show some manners for once.


36
00:05:15.175 --> 00:05:17.508
Because you're drunk
and rolling around in the road.


37
00:05:17.591 --> 00:05:20.633
I've never seen anything like it.
You should be ashamed of yourself!


38
00:05:20.716 --> 00:05:24.675
Oh yeah? What about my husband?
Why are you always shouting?


39
00:05:24.758 --> 00:05:26.841
Because you're a gobby little smart-arse.

40
00:05:26.925 --> 00:05:29.466
Well, if I'm gobby, you're the biggest cow
in the whole block.


41
00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.216
How dare you!

42
00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.883
What's so funny?
Why didn't you say anything?


43
00:05:35.966 --> 00:05:38.883
Kalinka, I don't argue
with angry women in windows.


44
00:05:38.966 --> 00:05:41.841
And if you
don't pipe down I'll call the police.


45
00:05:41.925 --> 00:05:44.133
- Your voice is too loud!
- It's not.


46
00:05:44.216 --> 00:05:46.176
You're a drunken stumbling mess.

47
00:05:46.216 --> 00:05:47.841
Oh yeah?

48
00:05:47.925 --> 00:05:50.442
Think you're
some big television star, do you?


49
00:05:50.466 --> 00:05:53.258
You're just a drunk.

50
00:05:53.341 --> 00:05:55.841
Why aren't you saying anything?

51
00:05:55.925 --> 00:05:58.425
You're just standing there
all quiet like a statue.


52
00:05:58.508 --> 00:06:00.633
Magda!

53
00:06:00.716 --> 00:06:02.925
- Magda!
- What?


54
00:06:03.466 --> 00:06:05.758
You want the keys again?

55
00:06:05.841 --> 00:06:07.050
Thank you.

56
00:06:21.716 --> 00:06:23.425
Can I come over?

57
00:06:26.008 --> 00:06:27.175
It's 3:00 in the morning.

58
00:06:28.175 --> 00:06:29.300
Thanks, Magda.

59
00:06:30.008 --> 00:06:32.008
- You're an angel.
- Not at all.


60
00:06:32.091 --> 00:06:34.776
- Come on, Krzyś. Back to bed.
- Can I come over when I get up?


61
00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:35.966
Of course you can.

62
00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:42.758
Oh, Fluffy!

63
00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:44.966
There you are.

64
00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:47.466
Well, now.

65
00:06:51.508 --> 00:06:52.508
I'm coming!

66
00:06:58.466 --> 00:06:59.758
CAFÉ

67
00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:02.133
Yes, we'd like some...

68
00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:07.258
I don't get it.
How are you always so slim?


69
00:07:08.383 --> 00:07:11.883
I hardly eat anything and I keep
getting fatter. It's driving me nuts.


70
00:07:11.966 --> 00:07:15.258
I'm not slim at all.
I'm just good at holding my stomach in.


71
00:07:15.841 --> 00:07:17.341
I should really go on a diet.

72
00:07:17.425 --> 00:07:19.550
There's no way I'm going on a diet.

73
00:07:20.883 --> 00:07:22.508
Oh, and, uh, why not?

74
00:07:24.091 --> 00:07:26.091
I might get saggy tits
instead of a smaller arse.


75
00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:32.258
- You're gonna eat that?
- Mmm, take it.


76
00:07:42.466 --> 00:07:43.466
Shall we?

77
00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:44.800
Hang on.

78
00:07:55.133 --> 00:07:56.300
- Kalina.
- What?


79
00:07:57.216 --> 00:07:59.800
I've been thinking
about dying my hair blonde.


80
00:07:59.883 --> 00:08:01.675
- You? Blonde?
- Hmm.


81
00:08:01.758 --> 00:08:03.633
You always make fun of fake blondes.

82
00:08:03.716 --> 00:08:05.675
Yeah, well, I changed my mind.

83
00:08:06.175 --> 00:08:09.383
Mmm. You should use peroxide.

84
00:08:10.091 --> 00:08:13.216
It's great. Although it does
completely fuck up your hair.


85
00:08:15.633 --> 00:08:18.175
- So what's Janusz done now?
- Janusz?


86
00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:20.550
Oh, come on, it's obvious.

87
00:08:22.341 --> 00:08:23.341
Do you like this?

88
00:08:24.925 --> 00:08:27.383
I'm not a pensioner.
I'd never wear gabardine.


89
00:08:27.466 --> 00:08:28.675
It's crimplene.

90
00:08:31.008 --> 00:08:33.466
What an underwhelming selection!

91
00:08:34.008 --> 00:08:35.088
Don't be too picky,

92
00:08:35.133 --> 00:08:37.841
or you'll end up singing
for those miners in the nude.


93
00:08:37.925 --> 00:08:39.550
Actually, they might enjoy that.

94
00:08:39.633 --> 00:08:41.341
Ah. Here.

95
00:08:44.425 --> 00:08:46.050
It's perfect.

96
00:08:46.133 --> 00:08:48.175
Little bit depressing, though, isn't it?

97
00:08:48.258 --> 00:08:50.550
Not if I give it a stunning neckline.

98
00:08:50.633 --> 00:08:53.091
Forty zlotys a metre. Fuck that!

99
00:08:53.175 --> 00:08:54.966
I'm not made of money, am I?

100
00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:58.008
So we'll take two metres. I'll pay.

101
00:08:59.966 --> 00:09:02.008
Aren't you sweet. Thank you.

102
00:09:03.925 --> 00:09:06.508
Ah. This neckline would really suit you.

103
00:09:07.591 --> 00:09:09.050
Thank you.

104
00:09:09.133 --> 00:09:11.091
I'm telling you,
it's Jędrusik.


105
00:09:11.175 --> 00:09:14.050
- It can't be. She's too ugly.
- I'm telling you, it's her.


106
00:09:14.133 --> 00:09:16.341
I've never liked her, you know.

107
00:09:16.425 --> 00:09:18.758

You're young.

So then, how was your date?

139
00:13:06.425 --> 00:13:10.883
Date? What date?
With the proofreader? More like hard work.


140
00:13:12.883 --> 00:13:17.341
Well, it's not every writer who goes
to Kraków just to see their proofreader.


141
00:13:17.425 --> 00:13:20.425
She's incredibly dull
if it makes you feel better.


142
00:13:20.508 --> 00:13:22.133
It most certainly does.

143
00:13:25.341 --> 00:13:26.466
You all right?

144
00:13:27.091 --> 00:13:28.466
- Hello.
- Coffee?


145
00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:29.550
Oh yeah.

146
00:13:30.341 --> 00:13:31.341
I'll have one too.

147
00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:46.341
Mmm.

148
00:14:00.466 --> 00:14:01.758
Ireland beat us 2-0.

149
00:14:01.841 --> 00:14:04.966
But they're still saying
we played the better game.


150
00:14:05.633 --> 00:14:09.883
So we played the best,
but then so did they. Ridiculous.


151
00:14:10.008 --> 00:14:11.466
Everyone played best.

152
00:14:14.383 --> 00:14:15.550
Shall I go?

153
00:14:20.466 --> 00:14:21.883
Hello, Mr Marian.

154
00:14:21.966 --> 00:14:22.883
Oh, hello there.

155
00:14:22.966 --> 00:14:26.800
Still popular with the ladies, I see.
Twenty postcards today.


156
00:14:26.883 --> 00:14:29.925
Can't help it. Sorry.
They keep playing my song on the radio.


157
00:14:30.008 --> 00:14:33.675
Yeah. My daughter puts it on
full volume whenever she hears your voice.


158
00:14:33.758 --> 00:14:35.216
Anyway... See you.

159
00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:36.780
Yeah. Goodbye.

160
00:14:37.758 --> 00:14:41.758
Mmm. Kalinka, it looks like
you've got some competition.


161
00:14:43.508 --> 00:14:44.508
Hmm.

162
00:14:48.758 --> 00:14:51.300
"I love you and your voice."

163
00:14:52.716 --> 00:14:53.800
"I love you...

164
00:14:56.383 --> 00:14:57.508
and your voice."

165
00:14:58.091 --> 00:15:00.591
"I can't sleep.
I can't stop thinking about you."


166
00:15:02.216 --> 00:15:06.216
"Please, please, would you send me
an autograph with a dedication."


167
00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:08.466
"I think you're gorgeous."

168
00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:10.341
"Yours sincerely, Jagódka."

169
00:15:11.133 --> 00:15:13.508
"I think you're gorgeous."
I might use that.


170
00:15:18.258 --> 00:15:20.716
- Hello. Hi.
- Hello.


171
00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:22.133
Don't step on the black squares.

172
00:15:22.216 --> 00:15:24.925
- But the snails don't live there.
- They do.


173
00:15:25.008 --> 00:15:27.841
- Be careful. Don't crush them.
- What's for lunch?


174
00:15:27.925 --> 00:15:30.925
- I don't know. Looks weird.
- It's a recipe from Bombay.


175
00:15:31.425 --> 00:15:32.258
Where?

176
00:15:32.341 --> 00:15:35.675
From far away. You don't
have to eat if you don't want to.


177
00:15:38.508 --> 00:15:39.508
Lovely.

178
00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:42.883
And where is Bombay?

179
00:15:42.966 --> 00:15:45.800
You don't know?
What do they teach you in school?


180
00:15:46.341 --> 00:15:48.383
I'm too young to go to school.

181
00:15:48.466 --> 00:15:50.050
That's right. You're too young.

182
00:15:50.675 --> 00:15:51.675
I am.

183
00:15:52.216 --> 00:15:53.591
I'll let you off this once.

184
00:15:55.508 --> 00:15:57.008
2:15. Tadzio.

185
00:16:03.883 --> 00:16:05.091
Mmm, yummy.

186
00:16:05.175 --> 00:16:06.175
Hello?

187
00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:09.508
No. No. Wrong number.

188
00:16:11.216 --> 00:16:12.216
Goodbye.

189
00:16:18.425 --> 00:16:20.841
Tadzio is running late.
That's not like him.


190
00:16:21.716 --> 00:16:23.591
Ula, are you gonna finish that?

191
00:16:25.508 --> 00:16:29.883
DECEMBER 4, 1962
MINER'S DAY


192
00:16:45.091 --> 00:16:46.758
Hello, my artist comrades.

193
00:16:49.091 --> 00:16:51.008
- Good evening.
- Good evening.


194
00:16:51.091 --> 00:16:52.341
Very nice to see you.

195
00:16:54.466 --> 00:16:56.425
All right. So how are we?

196
00:16:57.008 --> 00:16:59.091
A little stage fright, but I'm all right.

197
00:16:59.175 --> 00:17:03.341
I'm not frightened. I'm on after Jędrusik.
So no one's gonna listen to me anyway.


198
00:17:03.966 --> 00:17:06.050
Jędrusik? You mean Kalina Jędrusik?

199
00:17:06.633 --> 00:17:08.091
Yes. She makes such an impact

200
00:17:08.175 --> 00:17:10.925
that once it's over
nothing else matters afterwards.


201
00:17:11.466 --> 00:17:16.300
Ah! Forgive me. Allow me to introduce
my successor, Ryszard Molski.


202
00:17:16.383 --> 00:17:19.300
He'll be head of television entertainment
from now on.


203
00:17:20.425 --> 00:17:22.341
Mieczysława Burska.

204
00:17:22.425 --> 00:17:23.425
Pleasure.

205
00:17:23.758 --> 00:17:25.175
- Marek Nowakowski.
- Pleasure.


206
00:17:25.258 --> 00:17:27.091
So what's next for you, Director?

207
00:17:27.175 --> 00:17:29.300
Well, I'm now moving
up to the top floor.

208
00:17:29.383 --> 00:17:32.091
Now I'll be running
the entire television station.


209
00:17:32.175 --> 00:17:34.716
Well, quite a promotion.
Congratulation.


210
00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:35.925
Do you know where she is?

211
00:17:36.008 --> 00:17:38.133
In the dressing room,
warming up.


212
00:17:38.925 --> 00:17:40.508
If she can be bothered, that is.

213
00:17:41.383 --> 00:17:44.716
Actually we used to perform together.

214
00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:45.925
THEATER BUFFET

215
00:17:46.008 --> 00:17:48.425
Oh,
a fellow actor in our midst.


216
00:17:49.008 --> 00:17:52.175
Though you're... a director now.

217
00:17:54.133 --> 00:17:56.008
So you're intimate with Jędrusik.

218
00:17:56.091 --> 00:17:58.508
He's a lucky man.
Not everyone can say that.


219
00:17:58.591 --> 00:18:02.883
Let's not exaggerate, Comrade Mikosz.
She just used to have a...


220
00:18:02.966 --> 00:18:04.550
bit of a soft soft for me.

221
00:18:05.216 --> 00:18:08.091
I wouldn't mind if she had a soft
for me as well, I'm telling you.


222
00:18:08.175 --> 00:18:09.901
All right. Stand by, everyone.

223
00:18:09.925 --> 00:18:11.966
And can I have the folk band
on the stage, please?


224
00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:13.050
Ah.

225
00:18:16.383 --> 00:18:17.216
Shall we go?

226
00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:19.383
- To see Kalina?
- To see the show.


227
00:18:28.008 --> 00:18:29.341
How do I look?

228
00:18:32.383 --> 00:18:34.341
Absolutely fantastic.

229
00:18:35.466 --> 00:18:37.883
You don't think
the neckline's a little bit low?


230
00:18:38.425 --> 00:18:41.966
It has to be low though,
especially when I'm on the stage.


231
00:18:42.591 --> 00:18:44.508
My neck is short and I am short,

232
00:18:44.591 --> 00:18:47.300
so I'd look like a little mushroom
if my neckline was any higher.


233
00:18:48.841 --> 00:18:49.925
Well, maybe a little.

234
00:18:50.008 --> 00:18:51.758
Not a little bit, a lot.

235
00:18:51.841 --> 00:18:54.133
Anyway, no need to be polite with me.

236
00:18:56.216 --> 00:18:57.466
Oh God, it's time.

237
00:18:57.550 --> 00:19:01.633
Shit! And I keep bloody forgetting
the second stanza of the lyrics.


238
00:19:03.466 --> 00:19:05.508
Oh please! You know them by heart.

239
00:19:07.091 --> 00:19:08.341
Kick me for good luck?

240
00:19:12.258 --> 00:19:15.175
Fuck's sake! My arse is way too big.

241
00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:18.758
<i>Kalina Jędrusik,
this is your five-minute call.</i>


242
00:19:20.008 --> 00:19:21.133
I'm going now.

243
00:19:58.258 --> 00:20:00.175
<i>...this wonderful night.</i>

244
00:20:00.258 --> 00:20:03.050
<i>A huge thank you

245
00:20:03.133 --> 00:20:06.133
<i>And now let's bring on
the star of the show.</i>


246
00:20:06.216 --> 00:20:10.091
<i>Dearest comrades, the hard-working
mining heroes of our homeland,</i>


247
00:20:10.175 --> 00:20:12.341
<i>and you, their honoured wives.</i>

248
00:20:12.883 --> 00:20:17.966
<i>Please welcome by special request\
of the working class, Kalina Jędrusik!</i>


249
00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:24.133

You were so wonderful.
Can I have your autograph?


269
00:22:33.008 --> 00:22:34.008
'Course you can, sweety.

270
00:22:34.091 --> 00:22:38.966
Kalinka! Kalinka! 
My sweet Kalinka!

271
00:22:39.050 --> 00:22:42.383
Kalinka, you were phenomenal.

272
00:22:42.466 --> 00:22:43.300
Marian!

273
00:22:43.383 --> 00:22:44.550
I could almost eat you.

274
00:22:44.633 --> 00:22:47.591
Oh, I wouldn't do that, darling.
I'm so full of calories.


275
00:22:47.675 --> 00:22:49.883
- We have to go.
- I don't care. No, not yet.


276
00:22:49.966 --> 00:22:52.442
You're like a juicy doughnut,
so sweet I could gobble you up...


277
00:22:52.466 --> 00:22:54.506
You wouldn't want
to spoil your appetite, would you?


278
00:22:54.550 --> 00:22:57.383
I'm sure your wife has
a lovely dinner waiting for you at home.


279
00:22:57.466 --> 00:22:59.966
You have no shame!
Keep your preppy hands off our men!


280
00:23:00.050 --> 00:23:01.050
Thank you.

281
00:23:04.008 --> 00:23:06.633
Well, hello there, my dearest Kalina!
How the devil are you?


282
00:23:06.716 --> 00:23:08.925
Do I know you?

283
00:23:10.675 --> 00:23:11.883
Kalina!

284
00:23:13.216 --> 00:23:15.508
Really. You don't remember?

285
00:23:16.175 --> 00:23:17.258
No.

286
00:23:17.883 --> 00:23:19.925
We performed together at the seaside.

287
00:23:20.716 --> 00:23:21.716
Oh! Right!

288
00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:25.508
It's Molski. Rysiek Molski. Come on!

289
00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:27.300
Oh, Rysiek.

290
00:23:27.883 --> 00:23:30.508
Well, it's lovely to see you,
but I'm busy so...


291
00:23:30.591 --> 00:23:32.300
Oh okay. I'll wait for you here.

292
00:23:32.841 --> 00:23:35.091
- What for?
- You can join me for some dinner.


293
00:23:35.925 --> 00:23:37.591
I'm going back to Warsaw tonight.

294
00:23:37.675 --> 00:23:40.008
- My chauffeur will then take you back.
- Oh. Chauffeur?


295
00:23:40.091 --> 00:23:44.716
Yeah. Because as it happens,
I'm now head of television entertainment.


296
00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:46.175
- You're not.
- I am.


297
00:23:46.258 --> 00:23:48.050
Oh shit.

298
00:23:48.133 --> 00:23:50.216
So how about dinner with your new exec?

299
00:23:51.091 --> 00:23:54.341
That's so kind. Though I'm having dinner
with my husband in Warsaw.


300
00:23:55.508 --> 00:23:56.508
Really?

301
00:23:58.216 --> 00:23:59.258
Really.

302
00:23:59.341 --> 00:24:00.341
Mmm.

303
00:24:01.091 --> 00:24:01.925
Sure about that?

304
00:24:02.008 --> 00:24:03.050
I'm afraid so.

305
00:24:03.591 --> 00:24:05.175
Now that you're my boss though,

306
00:24:05.258 --> 00:24:07.716
I'm sure we'll be seeing
a lot more of each other.

313
00:24:37.675 --> 00:24:39.550
...been given the keys to the bank."

314
00:24:41.925 --> 00:24:43.800
But you're always writing about love.

315
00:24:44.550 --> 00:24:47.008
And so am I, by plagiarising you.

316
00:24:47.091 --> 00:24:50.341
That's funny. I thought
I was the one plagiarising you.


317
00:24:50.883 --> 00:24:53.216
People keep saying Dygat copying Konwicki.

318
00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:55.591
I hear that
it's Konwicki who copies Dygat.


319
00:24:55.675 --> 00:24:57.966
Maybe you two shouldn't talk
on the phone so often then.


320
00:24:58.050 --> 00:24:59.290
We talk when we need to.

321
00:24:59.341 --> 00:25:00.175
Hello.

322
00:25:00.258 --> 00:25:03.008
But you could call it artistic symbiosis.

323
00:25:03.550 --> 00:25:06.300
Will you mentor me?

324
00:25:07.508 --> 00:25:10.300
Young lady, I have enough to deal with.

325
00:25:10.383 --> 00:25:13.341
I'm taking care of a fellow named Tadeusz,

326
00:25:13.425 --> 00:25:17.133
which doesn't leave,
um, much time for you.


327
00:25:26.425 --> 00:25:28.133
All right. Goodbye then.

328
00:25:33.716 --> 00:25:36.050
Tadzio, that girl was gorgeous.
Wasn't she?


329
00:25:36.133 --> 00:25:38.841
I mean, for God's sake, what a stunner!

330
00:25:38.925 --> 00:25:43.175
Yes, of course she was, but beauty
is nothing without intelligence.


331
00:25:43.258 --> 00:25:45.841
Well, that's a load of nonsense, isn't it?

332
00:25:45.925 --> 00:25:48.550
As long as she's pretty
nothing else matters.


333
00:25:48.633 --> 00:25:52.050
Kaziu, you still have
one or two things to learn yet about life.


334
00:25:52.133 --> 00:25:55.091
Yeah, and all the best life lessons
come with vodka.


335
00:25:55.175 --> 00:25:56.883
- Three vodkas, please.
- He's right.


336
00:25:56.966 --> 00:26:00.925
Vodka? It's not even midday.
Surely we're not that extravagant.


337
00:26:01.008 --> 00:26:03.050
Oh shit! My rehearsal's at noon.

338
00:26:33.966 --> 00:26:36.966
Oh, hold on, you cretin.
Can't you see I'm busy?


339
00:26:43.425 --> 00:26:44.716
Oi, move it now!

340
00:26:45.966 --> 00:26:49.216
Right. No need to shout.
You'll give yourself a...


341
00:27:02.883 --> 00:27:05.591
My dear Kalinka,
our favourite star! Oh my!


342
00:27:05.675 --> 00:27:06.550
Hello.

343
00:27:06.633 --> 00:27:09.341
You're looking just as gorgeous as ever.

344
00:27:09.425 --> 00:27:11.383
- Have they started?
- I'm afraid that they have.


345
00:27:11.466 --> 00:27:12.817
Are they angry?

346
00:27:12.841 --> 00:27:16.091
I think they will be more worried
if you weren't late for once, don't you?


347
00:27:17.133 --> 00:27:19.675
Oh. Oh damn.
Nothing like a good French lipstick.


348
00:27:19.758 --> 00:27:20.591
Yes.

349
00:27:20.675 --> 00:27:22.383
They're almost impossible to get ahold of.

350
00:27:22.466 --> 00:27:23.466
A real nightmare.

351
00:27:23.550 --> 00:27:25.258
Here you go. I got you some veal.

352
00:27:25.341 --> 00:27:27.675
Just a taster,
but I know how much you love it.


353
00:27:27.758 --> 00:27:29.216
Oh, that's... that's...

354
00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:30.800
Oh, good afternoon, sir.

355
00:27:35.425 --> 00:27:37.675
Kalinka, you really are too kind.

356
00:27:37.758 --> 00:27:40.050
Excuse me, madam.
Where did you get that meat?


357
00:27:40.133 --> 00:27:43.133
Yes, you. I'm asking you
where you got that meat from?


358
00:27:44.341 --> 00:27:45.633
I have my sources.

359
00:27:46.425 --> 00:27:47.425
See you later.

360
00:27:48.591 --> 00:27:51.008
Do you have to
simper over her like that?

361
00:27:52.550 --> 00:27:55.633
So what's your problem
with her, Krystyna? Come on.


362
00:27:57.133 --> 00:27:58.133
Well, I don't know.

363
00:27:58.216 --> 00:28:01.508
Maybe all that veal is making you soft
in the head or something.


364
00:28:06.591 --> 00:28:07.966
Hello, there.

365
00:28:10.383 --> 00:28:12.341
Ms Ula told us to wait.

366
00:28:12.425 --> 00:28:13.716
Hello. Mwah!

367
00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:16.550
Oh, the Autumn Girl.
How kind of you to join us.


368
00:28:19.466 --> 00:28:22.425
Jeremi was about to ask
the receptionist to fill in for you.


369
00:28:23.966 --> 00:28:25.758
You're on thin ice. 
You know that.

370
00:28:26.258 --> 00:28:29.591
Sorry. I do try not to be late,
but I don't wear a watch.


371
00:28:29.675 --> 00:28:31.466
We're rehearsing your scene
in ten minutes.


372
00:28:31.550 --> 00:28:32.883
Yes, of course.

373
00:28:44.550 --> 00:28:45.550
Here, let me.

374
00:28:46.425 --> 00:28:48.550
Yes, another man, he's angry at me.

375
00:28:48.633 --> 00:28:50.341
Jeremi always looks angry.

376
00:28:50.425 --> 00:28:51.425
Not Jeremi.

377
00:28:51.466 --> 00:28:54.008
- Then who?
- Actually, it was our new boss.


378
00:28:54.550 --> 00:28:55.841
You met him already?

379
00:28:55.925 --> 00:28:58.300
- Ugh. We used to perform together.
- So?


380
00:28:59.175 --> 00:29:00.716
So, he was hitting on me.

381
00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:03.175
He's still got a thing for me.

382
00:29:03.258 --> 00:29:08.258
He cornered me after the show on
Miner's Day and asked me out for dinner.


383
00:29:09.216 --> 00:29:10.216
And?

384
00:29:10.550 --> 00:29:13.133
I turned him down. He's so dull.

385
00:29:13.675 --> 00:29:16.841
Then, just now, I saw him in the corridor
and he was sulking.


386
00:29:16.925 --> 00:29:20.800
Everyone says good things about him.
He acts. He's on our side.


387
00:29:20.883 --> 00:29:23.883
Why not give him a chance?
Go out for dinner.


388
00:29:24.508 --> 00:29:27.675
What? And let him
lecture over me all over again?


389
00:29:29.341 --> 00:29:34.050
Or maybe he can come
and have a vodka with us at SPATiF.


390
00:29:34.133 --> 00:29:35.466
Mmm.

391
00:29:35.550 --> 00:29:36.466
Well, maybe.

392
00:29:36.550 --> 00:29:38.050
Come on, just do it.

393
00:29:39.758 --> 00:29:41.841
We all need to
get on with our boss.

394
00:29:41.925 --> 00:29:44.633
And he seems like
a perfectly decent person.


395
00:29:45.175 --> 00:29:48.883
He knows
he's not the best actor in the world.


396
00:29:49.633 --> 00:29:50.633
And he's charming.

397
00:29:51.216 --> 00:29:54.341
You know, just don't fall in love
with him. Remember Janusz.


398
00:29:55.758 --> 00:29:57.633
- You were right.
- About what?


399
00:29:58.758 --> 00:30:02.966
I think Janusz
is sleeping with that dancer, Kamila.


400
00:30:03.841 --> 00:30:06.050
The ballet dancer with the long legs?

401
00:30:06.133 --> 00:30:07.425
That little bitch!

402
00:30:08.008 --> 00:30:10.258
That bitch is adorable.

403
00:30:10.341 --> 00:30:12.341
And she's clearly the best dancer
in Warsaw.


404
00:30:12.425 --> 00:30:14.675
Best dancer in Warsaw? Bullshit.

405
00:30:14.758 --> 00:30:16.776
- She's a clumsy little cow.
- Keep your voice down...


406
00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:18.925
I'll not keep it down.
I can't stand posers like her.


407
00:30:19.008 --> 00:30:21.383
- Posers?
- She's only pretending to be pretty.


408
00:30:21.466 --> 00:30:22.841
She can't dance.

409
00:30:22.925 --> 00:30:25.175
She actually has
a bit of a hunch back.


410
00:30:25.258 --> 00:30:27.758
And a squint. And her legs are wonky.

411
00:30:27.841 --> 00:30:29.133
She dances like this.

412
00:30:34.216 --> 00:30:35.216
Aah!

413
00:30:40.175 --> 00:30:43.591
All right, everyone. The clock's ticking.
Stand by for transmission, please.


414
00:30:44.133 --> 00:30:46.466
You're right.
That is how she moves.


415
00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:53.300
- What are you working on right now?
- I'll tell you.


416
00:30:53.383 --> 00:30:54.216
Mrs Marysia.

417
00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:55.591
Here you go, Tadzio.

418
00:30:56.133 --> 00:30:57.213
She's gonna be in my movie.

419
00:30:57.258 --> 00:30:58.508
Staś hates working.

420
00:30:58.591 --> 00:31:02.091
So Kalina,
she has to lock him up in a room


421
00:31:02.175 --> 00:31:04.466
like some kind of very dangerous freak.

422
00:31:04.550 --> 00:31:07.633
Otherwise,
he won't write anything.


423
00:31:08.591 --> 00:31:09.758
What's it about?

424
00:31:11.591 --> 00:31:13.466
- Well, love, obviously.
- Hmm.


425
00:31:15.675 --> 00:31:19.133
So you're not writing about Poland?
About everything that's happening?


426
00:31:19.216 --> 00:31:22.716
Why on earth would I want to write
about everything that's happening?


427
00:31:28.216 --> 00:31:29.341
Ready?

428
00:31:31.841 --> 00:31:33.008
Here we go.

429
00:31:33.091 --> 00:31:34.091
Camera!

430
00:31:39.383 --> 00:31:40.383
Action!

431
00:31:49.133 --> 00:31:49.966
Sit down.

432
00:31:50.050 --> 00:31:53.758

00:32:49.258 --> 00:32:50.925
Isn't she wonderful?

447
00:33:02.716 --> 00:33:04.008
- Finally.
- That was good.


448
00:33:04.091 --> 00:33:05.591
That was divine.

449
00:33:05.675 --> 00:33:07.508
Rysiek, lovely to see you.

450
00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:10.633
Look, I'm sorry about
not going out for dinner.


451
00:33:11.966 --> 00:33:13.591
You're not angry, are you?

452
00:33:14.466 --> 00:33:16.800
I thought you would
appreciate the invitation.


453
00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:20.300
- I'm not just anybody.
- No, of course you're not.


454
00:33:21.383 --> 00:33:24.133
And I don't want you and I
to get off on the wrong foot.


455
00:33:24.633 --> 00:33:26.258
I'm going to make it up to you.

456
00:33:26.925 --> 00:33:27.925
Oh?

457
00:33:28.758 --> 00:33:31.133
- How's that?
- Why don't we go for a vodka?


458
00:33:32.008 --> 00:33:33.633
Everyone's going after the show.

459
00:33:33.716 --> 00:33:34.758
Everyone?

460
00:33:34.841 --> 00:33:36.466
Rysiek, you're a boss.

461
00:33:36.550 --> 00:33:39.425
It's hardly a surprise
that everyone wants to meet you.


462
00:33:41.133 --> 00:33:42.133
No?

463
00:33:45.383 --> 00:33:49.300
- I suppose you do have a point.
- Well, that's fantastic.


464
00:33:49.966 --> 00:33:51.883
They're a brilliant team, you'll see.

465
00:34:03.841 --> 00:34:05.508
SPATiF. Good evening.

466
00:34:07.966 --> 00:34:10.508
Holoubek? No, he's not here.

467
00:34:36.675 --> 00:34:38.425
You haven't changed, Kalina.

468
00:34:38.508 --> 00:34:40.841
You're just as you always were.
Sheer magnetic.


469
00:34:40.925 --> 00:34:43.175
- Oh, don't say that, Rysiek.
- No, I mean it.


470
00:34:43.258 --> 00:34:46.425
On Miner's Day,
the whole audience was staring at you.


471
00:34:46.508 --> 00:34:48.633
It's almost like you hypnotized them.

472
00:34:48.716 --> 00:34:50.883
I've always been really jealous
of her charisma.


473
00:34:50.966 --> 00:34:52.300
Oh, Rysiek, please.

474
00:34:52.383 --> 00:34:55.300
Maybe you weren't quite as terrible
as everyone said you were.


475
00:34:55.383 --> 00:34:57.925
I just wasn't cut out
for acting in the end.


476
00:34:58.008 --> 00:35:01.091
Maybe you're
just a natural-born director.


477
00:35:03.133 --> 00:35:06.216
- Well, I'm nothing like you, Kalina.
- Oh, come on.


478
00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:08.883
No, I mean it. 
You're beautiful, talented,

479
00:35:08.966 --> 00:35:11.383
and what's more,
the whole world's in love with you.


480
00:35:11.466 --> 00:35:15.425
There's something about you
that's just completely unforgettable.


481
00:35:15.508 --> 00:35:17.341
Stop it, Rysiek. Please.

482
00:35:22.466 --> 00:35:23.508
Fucking hell!

483
00:35:25.883 --> 00:35:27.091
What is it?

484
00:35:27.175 --> 00:35:28.800
Look at that fur.

485
00:35:29.550 --> 00:35:32.091
Come on, Kalina.
She's not nearly as pretty as you.


486
00:35:32.175 --> 00:35:34.341
But I don't have that fur, do I?

487
00:35:34.425 --> 00:35:36.675
Do you have any idea
how expensive those things are?


488
00:35:36.758 --> 00:35:39.341
And a star like you
can't afford it? Really?


489
00:35:39.425 --> 00:35:40.425
No, Rysiek.

490
00:35:40.466 --> 00:35:43.716
And that's because you pay peanuts
so your stars can't afford nice clothes.


491
00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:46.216
Ah, so that's why you perform
with no clothes on.


492
00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:49.008
You got it.

493
00:35:57.633 --> 00:35:59.508
You'll get your fur.

494
00:35:59.591 --> 00:36:01.008
- Yeah?
- Yes.


495
00:36:02.008 --> 00:36:03.008
Come.

496
00:36:05.258 --> 00:36:07.175
I'm your boss. 
Now you do as I say.

497
00:36:07.258 --> 00:36:10.341
Oh. Well, if it's an order,
I probably should.


498
00:36:10.425 --> 00:36:12.091
Good evening, Mr Franio.

499
00:36:12.175 --> 00:36:14.008
Evening, Mr Henio.

500
00:36:14.091 --> 00:36:16.383
Anything fresh left on the menu?
Be honest.


501
00:36:16.466 --> 00:36:19.050
Honestly, I would suggest
you try the steak tartare.


502
00:36:19.133 --> 00:36:21.300
I don't like tartare.

503
00:36:22.925 --> 00:36:25.050
If the steak tartare
is not to your liking,


504
00:36:25.133 --> 00:36:26.966
I would recommend a vodka
for the gentlemen.


505
00:36:27.050 --> 00:36:28.258
Oh, now that I like.

506
00:36:29.591 --> 00:36:31.008
Yeah, let's go to the bar.

507
00:36:31.091 --> 00:36:33.050
- Thank you, Franio.
- You're welcome.


508
00:36:34.841 --> 00:36:38.050
My dear Franio, this lady
would like to try on that fur coat.


509
00:36:39.133 --> 00:36:42.216
I'm sorry. I don't have one
available at the moment.


510
00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:44.133
But I can try to find you one.

511
00:36:44.216 --> 00:36:46.633
- What type?
- Not to buy. Just to try on.


512
00:36:46.716 --> 00:36:47.716
That one, there.

513
00:36:50.883 --> 00:36:52.550
Sir, this isn't a clothing store.

514
00:36:53.216 --> 00:36:54.466
But it is though, isn't it?

515
00:36:56.050 --> 00:36:59.133
Look, I'm sorry.
It belongs to the ambassador's wife...


516
00:36:59.216 --> 00:37:00.258
Look, Franio.

517
00:37:00.341 --> 00:37:04.216
I'm willing to pay you very well indeed
for your service. You won't regret it.


518
00:37:06.633 --> 00:37:07.883
I can lose my job for this.

519
00:37:07.966 --> 00:37:09.883
What? Don't you like me?

520
00:37:09.966 --> 00:37:12.425
Oh, you're wonderful. It's just...

521
00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:16.425
- I still prefer my job.
- Really?


522
00:37:17.633 --> 00:37:18.716
Ugh.

523
00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:23.925
Okay, fine. We'll call it a secret
between the three of us, shall we then?


524
00:37:28.466 --> 00:37:30.050
Oh my God, look at it!

525
00:37:30.591 --> 00:37:33.508
- It's so soft. It's lovely.
- Come on.


526
00:37:35.633 --> 00:37:36.675
Put it on.

527
00:37:41.466 --> 00:37:42.966
There. Well?

528
00:37:44.258 --> 00:37:45.300
Incredible.

529
00:37:51.550 --> 00:37:53.258
What about me? How's this?

530
00:37:53.341 --> 00:37:54.341
Well...

531
00:37:54.841 --> 00:37:56.758
- Pretty handsome, actually.
- Yeah?


532
00:37:56.841 --> 00:38:00.841
- It's a little bit tight, though.
- And mine's too big. Let's switch.


533
00:38:09.550 --> 00:38:11.883
I adore you, Kalina. I adore you.

534
00:38:12.466 --> 00:38:14.675
Please call me Stefan.

535
00:38:17.133 --> 00:38:18.883
- Will you sing for me?
- What?


536
00:38:19.425 --> 00:38:21.508
Sing for me like
you do in the studio.

537
00:38:21.591 --> 00:38:23.800
I wasn't singing
in the studio there, was I?


538
00:38:23.883 --> 00:38:25.883
I was miming to playback.

539
00:38:26.716 --> 00:38:28.716
Well, now you can
really sing for me, yeah?


540
00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:31.175
Rysiek, no, I don't want you
to hear me sing out of tune.


541
00:38:31.258 --> 00:38:33.175
- Sing for me.
- Mmm!


542
00:38:34.383 --> 00:38:35.466
Sing for me.

543
00:38:43.133 --> 00:38:45.175
<i>♪ I'm looking at you... ♪</i>

544

548
00:39:05.508 --> 00:39:07.633
<i>Kalina,
do you think you can love me?</i>


549
00:39:08.883 --> 00:39:11.508
No, Rysiek, I couldn't.

550
00:39:12.216 --> 00:39:13.216
Why not?

551
00:39:13.841 --> 00:39:16.466
Stop it. Let's get
out of here, shall we?

552
00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:19.091
- Why? I want to make love to you.
- Rysiek!


553
00:39:19.175 --> 00:39:21.675
- Kalina, I want to make love to you.
- Rysiek!


554
00:39:21.758 --> 00:39:24.008
- Just for one night, that's all.
- No fucking way!


555
00:39:24.091 --> 00:39:25.883
Stop it!

556
00:39:25.966 --> 00:39:27.633
Rysiek! Stop it!

557
00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:29.841
I said no! Get off!

558
00:39:29.925 --> 00:39:31.258
- Stop it!
- And why not?


559
00:39:31.341 --> 00:39:33.758
You love to sleep around.
Everyone knows that.


560
00:39:33.841 --> 00:39:34.841
Rysiek!

561
00:39:35.383 --> 00:39:36.841
My sex life is my business.

562
00:39:37.466 --> 00:39:38.675
So stay out of it.

563
00:39:48.216 --> 00:39:49.758
Good night, Ms Kalinka.

564
00:39:49.841 --> 00:39:51.175
Good night, Mr Franio.

565
00:40:45.508 --> 00:40:47.050
- Hello.
- Hello, there.


566
00:40:47.133 --> 00:40:48.008
Hi.

567
00:41:11.466 --> 00:41:12.466
Hello!

568
00:41:15.133 --> 00:41:16.133
Hello!

569
00:41:20.508 --> 00:41:23.425
Jesus Christ!
What are you doing in here?


570
00:41:26.925 --> 00:41:28.383
I'm not dead, am I?

571
00:41:29.675 --> 00:41:32.466
No. I'm pretty sure you're still alive.

572
00:41:34.758 --> 00:41:36.216
How did you get in here?

573
00:41:37.175 --> 00:41:38.675
I'm not really here at all.

574
00:41:40.008 --> 00:41:41.675
I'm an apparition, my child.

575
00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:04.050
We're just gonna sit here, are we?

576
00:42:05.675 --> 00:42:08.883
I'm just here
to make you feel anxious, that's all.


577
00:42:08.966 --> 00:42:11.050
Oh, of course. Be my guest.

578
00:42:14.675 --> 00:42:15.925
Mmm.

579
00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:18.675
So what should I be anxious about?

580
00:42:19.925 --> 00:42:22.091
Ah, you'll have to find out for yourself.

581
00:42:27.216 --> 00:42:28.216
Hmm.

582
00:42:33.466 --> 00:42:34.716
Ah.

583
00:42:36.175 --> 00:42:37.466
- Hello.
- Hi.


584
00:42:37.550 --> 00:42:41.216
Welcome to our beautiful country.

585
00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:42.300
Well, well.

586
00:42:42.383 --> 00:42:43.883
My name is Nina.

587
00:42:43.966 --> 00:42:46.925
Fuck me, I didn't know
they spoke Chinese in here.


588
00:42:47.008 --> 00:42:48.300
Actually, it's Vietnamese.

589
00:42:48.383 --> 00:42:50.675
We had a delegation come here
and I learned some.


590
00:42:50.758 --> 00:42:52.175
Isn't it lovely?

591
00:42:52.258 --> 00:42:54.716
Yeah, lovely.
What other phrases do you know?


592
00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:58.341
Uh... <i>Cm n bn.</i>
It means "thank you."


593
00:42:58.425 --> 00:42:59.883
<i>Cm n...</i>

594
00:42:59.966 --> 00:43:02.466
<i>- ...bn.
- bn.</i>


595
00:43:02.550 --> 00:43:03.966
Please.

596
00:43:04.508 --> 00:43:05.508
Yes?

597
00:43:06.633 --> 00:43:08.008
Yes. Possibly.

598
00:43:08.675 --> 00:43:12.216
But really, there's no need to grovel.
It's a little embarrassing.


599
00:43:12.841 --> 00:43:15.633
Yes. I know I can be strict,
but I'm also fair.


600
00:43:17.758 --> 00:43:20.758
Well, in the end, that is my decision,
as you very well know.


601
00:43:22.175 --> 00:43:23.300
Good then. Bye.

602
00:43:26.050 --> 00:43:28.133
I see you're late as usual, Ms Kalina.

603
00:43:28.216 --> 00:43:31.133
You're very formal
all of a sudden.


604
00:43:31.216 --> 00:43:34.925
As you're well aware, I have a great deal
of respect for you, Ms Kalina.


605
00:43:35.008 --> 00:43:37.841
- In fact, I'm very fond of you.
- Yeah, I'm well aware of that.


606
00:43:39.050 --> 00:43:40.508
Would you like anything?

607
00:43:40.591 --> 00:43:42.758
- Not right now.
- Coffee with sugar.


608
00:43:46.175 --> 00:43:52.300
Though, sadly, I've been forced to suspend
all your future television appearances.


609
00:43:57.466 --> 00:43:58.466
Is that so?

610
00:44:02.341 --> 00:44:03.675
And who's forcing you?

611
00:44:04.883 --> 00:44:06.716
The people.

612
00:44:08.716 --> 00:44:10.966
- The people?
- Yes, the people.


613
00:44:11.050 --> 00:44:13.383
We're receiving
a huge number of complaints.


614
00:44:14.050 --> 00:44:15.883
People don't want to watch you.

615
00:44:16.675 --> 00:44:18.216
And why is that, may I ask?

616
00:44:19.716 --> 00:44:20.716
They're offended.

617
00:44:21.300 --> 00:44:23.175
By the dress you wore on Miner's Day.

618
00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:26.341
Offended by your low... neckline.

619
00:44:27.675 --> 00:44:29.550
By you. Everything about you.

620
00:44:30.341 --> 00:44:34.091
Rysiu, not so long ago
you said that they all loved me.


621
00:44:34.675 --> 00:44:36.925
Ms Kalina...

622
00:44:37.008 --> 00:44:38.758
...the nation has rejected you.

623
00:44:40.133 --> 00:44:42.758
The people have spoken
and they have made their decision.


624
00:44:42.841 --> 00:44:44.550
- Which fucking people?
- All of us.


625
00:44:46.008 --> 00:44:49.925
Your husband did his very best
to convince you that everyone loves you


626
00:44:50.008 --> 00:44:53.841
because he wanted you to become
Poland's answer to Marilyn Monroe.


627
00:44:53.925 --> 00:44:55.925
Unfortunately, you believed him.

628
00:44:56.008 --> 00:44:59.550
But the truth is
the people don't want you, Kalina.


629
00:45:01.675 --> 00:45:06.008
Believe me. I take no pleasure in seeing
a talent like yours go to waste.


630
00:45:06.591 --> 00:45:08.008
But there's nothing I can do.

631
00:45:08.091 --> 00:45:10.300
Now, I must ask
that you refrain from visiting


632
00:45:10.383 --> 00:45:13.633
or entering any Polish television premises
until further notice.


633
00:45:21.050 --> 00:45:23.675
Thank you, Rysiek. 
Well, that's great.

634
00:45:24.466 --> 00:45:27.466
Looks as if
you finally found your ideal job.


635
00:45:39.841 --> 00:45:42.008
Can't really say
if it's good or not.


636
00:45:45.050 --> 00:45:48.800
You said yourself recently
that I'm not a good...


637
00:45:53.716 --> 00:45:56.008
My expertise lies directly...

638
00:45:57.050 --> 00:45:58.966
Apart from my perspective...

639
00:46:04.966 --> 00:46:06.766
I don't know
how they will react to it.


640
00:46:06.841 --> 00:46:08.883
- What's wrong?
- I suppose you'll find out.


641
00:46:08.966 --> 00:46:11.050
- He fucking fired me.
- What?


642
00:46:11.675 --> 00:46:13.466
I'm not allowed on the television.

643
00:46:14.508 --> 00:46:17.341
He tried to fuck me
and obviously, I turned him down.


644
00:46:17.425 --> 00:46:19.466
Can you keep it down, all right?

645
00:46:20.550 --> 00:46:22.550
- Keep it down?
- I'm talking to Tadzio!


646
00:46:22.633 --> 00:46:24.300
You're always talking to Tadzio!

647
00:46:25.716 --> 00:46:27.925
Lucek, see how jealous she gets.

648
00:46:28.841 --> 00:46:31.383
That little shit just fired her.
Didn't he?


649
00:46:32.050 --> 00:46:33.258
Why is that?

650
00:46:34.050 --> 00:46:35.466
She turned him down.

651
00:46:35.550 --> 00:46:37.508
Ah.

652
00:46:39.633 --> 00:46:42.050
- You think that's funny?
- Well, a little.


653
00:46:42.133 --> 00:46:44.675
You do seem to attract
your fair share of idiots.


654
00:46:44.758 --> 00:46:46.133
Oh, so it's my fault?

655
00:46:47.091 --> 00:46:48.841
Kalinka, just give it to me back.

656
00:46:50.758 --> 00:46:52.466
Is that all you
have to say to me?

657
00:46:53.425 --> 00:46:55.341
What else am I meant to say?

658
00:46:56.050 --> 00:46:57.800
To hell with that randy little bastard.

659
00:46:57.883 --> 00:46:59.803
He's the one who
made a fool of himself, not you.


660
00:46:59.883 --> 00:47:01.716
He fired me from the studio.

661
00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:03.091
All right, look.

662
00:47:03.175 --> 00:47:05.841
This guy is not important.
He's just a desk clerk.


663
00:47:06.425 --> 00:47:09.091
Today it's Molski,
tomorrow it'll be someone else.


664
00:47:09.175 --> 00:47:11.091
But you're irreplaceable.

665
00:47:11.175 --> 00:47:14.050
So please don't get hysterical.
You know I don't like it.


666
00:47:15.841 --> 00:47:17.258
You should call Jeremi.

667
00:47:17.341 --> 00:47:21.091
I'm not calling anyone, all right.
The line's always busy anyway.


668
00:47:21.175 --> 00:47:22.550
You're very attractive,

669
00:47:22.633 --> 00:47:25.050
and a lot of men really just don't know
how to handle it.


670
00:47:25.133 --> 00:47:26.341
Like Lucek. Hello?

671
00:47:27.216 --> 00:47:28.591
What are you going to do?

672
00:47:30.883 --> 00:47:33.841
Don't know. Maybe I'll bash his brains in.

673
00:47:35.383 --> 00:47:36.841
You hear that, Tadzio?

674
00:47:47.716 --> 00:47:49.258
Just let it go, Kalinka.

675
00:47:52.508 --> 00:47:54.216
Seen my short story anywhere?

676
00:47:56.383 --> 00:47:57.383
Which one?

677
00:47:59.508 --> 00:48:02.508
You know, the one I read
when people ask what I'm working on.


678
00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:05.925
Ah, the one that
you keep as a backup.

679
00:48:06.008 --> 00:48:07.925
- That's the one.
- I'll get it.


680
00:48:09.550 --> 00:48:13.550

688
00:49:04.966 --> 00:49:06.300
Thanks. Appreciate it.

689
00:49:09.508 --> 00:49:10.841
Have we got a white one?

690
00:49:12.175 --> 00:49:13.425
What do you need it for?

691
00:49:14.675 --> 00:49:15.758
For Kaziu Kutz.

692
00:49:17.050 --> 00:49:18.050
Are you coming?

693
00:49:34.175 --> 00:49:35.800
- Hey, Kalina.
- Hi, Kaziu.


694
00:49:36.550 --> 00:49:37.800
You'll be needing this.

695
00:49:38.716 --> 00:49:40.341
Are you saying I need a wash?

696
00:49:40.425 --> 00:49:43.258
No, it's a prop.
You'll need it for the book signing.


697
00:49:43.925 --> 00:49:46.300
What the hell am I
gonna do with a towel?

698
00:49:46.383 --> 00:49:50.425
Just imagine that I'm a boxer
and that you Kaziu are my trainer.


699
00:49:50.508 --> 00:49:52.091
And we're going to a fight.

700
00:49:52.716 --> 00:49:56.300
A fight. Now you're talking.

701
00:49:58.508 --> 00:50:02.133
<i>In fact, writing </i>Lake Constance
<i>was quite a painful process for me</i>


702
00:50:02.216 --> 00:50:05.216
<i>because the protagonist's captivity
is so unmanly.</i>


703
00:50:05.300 --> 00:50:07.675
It's not funny. I mean it.

704
00:50:07.758 --> 00:50:11.341
Captivity, the kind
we experience every day is quite shameful,


705
00:50:11.425 --> 00:50:14.591
effeminate, and beyond our control,
and strips us of the will to fight.


706
00:50:15.675 --> 00:50:17.425
Back then, I really believed that.

707
00:50:18.591 --> 00:50:20.258
I have a question.

708
00:50:21.091 --> 00:50:24.925
What would you say the current trends are
in our Polish literature?


709
00:50:27.258 --> 00:50:29.383
No idea.

710
00:50:29.466 --> 00:50:30.800
No, but seriously.

711
00:50:30.883 --> 00:50:34.258
No, I really don't know.
I don't believe anyone does.


712
00:50:34.341 --> 00:50:36.466
Writers have to write, simple as that.

713
00:50:36.550 --> 00:50:38.258
Maybe they have views to express.

714
00:50:38.341 --> 00:50:42.091
Believe me, a lot of the time they write
even when they have nothing to say.


715
00:50:43.341 --> 00:50:46.221
The only reason they're writing is
to prove to the world they're writers.


716
00:50:46.300 --> 00:50:48.675
And 'cause they want
to keep their jobs, of course.


717
00:50:48.758 --> 00:50:51.883
The problem with that is
the characters they create are artificial.


718
00:50:51.966 --> 00:50:54.258
Hmm? They just don't seem real.

719
00:50:54.341 --> 00:50:56.591
I don't think you're being very fair.

720
00:51:00.133 --> 00:51:02.675
Well, of course, there are a few writers

721
00:51:02.758 --> 00:51:06.050
who are blessed with an irrepressible
and authentic personality.


722
00:51:07.175 --> 00:51:10.008
And yes, they only write
when they have something to say.


723
00:51:13.425 --> 00:51:16.216
But they're not part of a trend,
they're just being themselves.


724
00:51:16.300 --> 00:51:19.008
Exactly. And what are these trends anyway?

725
00:51:24.841 --> 00:51:27.258
- Time's up!
- Oh.


726
00:51:27.341 --> 00:51:29.466
Ladies and gentlemen,
my trainer clearly thinks


727
00:51:29.550 --> 00:51:31.883
this question is too difficult for me.

728
00:51:31.966 --> 00:51:34.883
So I'm throwing in the towel.
Thank you very much.


729
00:51:34.966 --> 00:51:37.925
- He's so arrogant.
- I don't think so at all.


730
00:51:38.008 --> 00:51:39.133
He's charming.

731
00:51:39.216 --> 00:51:41.216
Thank you.

732
00:51:41.841 --> 00:51:42.841
Thank you.

733
00:51:46.966 --> 00:51:49.425
What's your view
on the films of Ingrid Bergman?


734
00:51:49.508 --> 00:51:51.841
I think they're good.
Pleasure meeting you all.


735
00:51:51.925 --> 00:51:54.216
- Thank you.
- Goodbye. See you.


736
00:51:55.800 --> 00:51:59.091
- What do you think about Bergman's movies?
- Well, yes, up there with the greats.


737
00:52:00.341 --> 00:52:02.466
- How do you do it?
- Do what?


738
00:52:03.008 --> 00:52:06.341
You ridicule them,
and they all love you for it.


739
00:52:07.133 --> 00:52:08.550
I don't ridicule them. Do I?

740
00:52:08.633 --> 00:52:09.800
Of course not.

741
00:52:09.883 --> 00:52:13.300
I just don't take them seriously.
Or myself.


742
00:52:14.675 --> 00:52:15.675
Ah.

743
00:52:16.675 --> 00:52:17.675
Here.

744
00:52:58.341 --> 00:53:00.258
Nobody wants to buy me vodka.

745
00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:11.175
Have there always been
these many women in here?


746
00:53:11.675 --> 00:53:13.341
Yeah, it's always that less.

747
00:53:13.425 --> 00:53:16.841
The same old crowd of drunken tarts
who order chicken and Melba.


748
00:53:16.925 --> 00:53:18.091
Ah.

749
00:53:21.550 --> 00:53:23.008
What can I get you?

750
00:53:23.550 --> 00:53:26.425
A bottle of vodka. 
Actually, make it two.

751
00:53:26.966 --> 00:53:28.800
- Anything else?
- One cognac.


752
00:53:28.883 --> 00:53:31.258
And I'll have chicken and Melba as usual.

753
00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:36.466
Everyone, this is Maja.

754
00:53:36.550 --> 00:53:37.550
Bzowska Maja.

755
00:53:37.633 --> 00:53:40.758
Maja Bzowska.
She's just graduated from theatre school.


756
00:53:40.841 --> 00:53:43.591
So, now she's happened
to gain some experience


757
00:53:43.675 --> 00:53:45.425
in, well, in real life.

758
00:53:45.508 --> 00:53:48.133
You better not listen to Kaziu then.

759
00:53:48.216 --> 00:53:50.758
He doesn't know the first thing at all
about real life.


760
00:53:50.841 --> 00:53:52.466
And neither do we.

761
00:53:52.550 --> 00:53:54.466
Well, I adore all three of you men.

762
00:53:55.133 --> 00:53:57.966
I think everything you do
is incredible, honestly.


763
00:53:58.050 --> 00:54:00.925
I'm sure there's
a huge amount I can learn from you.


764
00:54:01.466 --> 00:54:03.758
What an interesting concept.

765
00:54:03.841 --> 00:54:05.508
I wonder though, what my wife would say.

766
00:54:05.591 --> 00:54:07.008
Oh, darling, I am sorry.

767
00:54:07.883 --> 00:54:10.716
But my husband finds teaching
a little challenging.


768
00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:14.550
You see, he's already tired
from the vigorous tuition he's giving me.


769
00:54:15.925 --> 00:54:20.675
Maja, I would be more than happy
to teach you whatever you want.


770
00:54:20.758 --> 00:54:22.341
Can I be in a film?

771
00:54:22.425 --> 00:54:24.716
- Of course you can.
- Now you're talking.


772
00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:27.383
Of course you can be in a movie.

773
00:54:27.466 --> 00:54:30.341
Ah, cognac! Excellent!

774
00:54:35.341 --> 00:54:38.341
- I haven't even set the dates yet.
- Two more. Ah.


775
00:54:38.425 --> 00:54:40.341
But actually, it's just as well,

776
00:54:40.425 --> 00:54:43.508
what, with this television theatre thing
with Adam coming up.


777
00:54:43.591 --> 00:54:44.591
Oh yeah.

778
00:54:45.091 --> 00:54:46.508
Kalina, is it true?

779
00:54:47.841 --> 00:54:48.966
That Molski fired you.

780
00:54:49.050 --> 00:54:51.675
Jesus, Baśka!
Give her a break and leave her alone.


781
00:54:51.758 --> 00:54:54.175
But everyone
is already talking all about it.


782
00:54:54.258 --> 00:54:56.883
It's true,
but it's truly nothing to worry about.


783
00:54:56.966 --> 00:54:58.966
I'm sure, in the end,
he will come crawling back.


784
00:54:59.050 --> 00:55:00.341
Exactly.

785
00:55:00.425 --> 00:55:03.841
I'm sorry. I just couldn't believe it.

786
00:55:19.300 --> 00:55:22.258
Adam! You don't mind if I cut in?

787
00:55:23.133 --> 00:55:26.091
Feel free.
Let us dance the night away together.


788
00:55:26.175 --> 00:55:27.591
By the way,

789
00:55:27.675 --> 00:55:30.758
I don't know the dates for
the next lot of <i>Cabaret</i>rehearsals,


790
00:55:30.841 --> 00:55:33.883
but I can definitely be available.
I'm all yours.


791
00:55:34.508 --> 00:55:37.008
Kalina, I thought
they had already told you.


792
00:55:37.091 --> 00:55:38.341
Told me what?

793
00:55:38.966 --> 00:55:40.766
Well, it looks like someone
in the upper ranks


794
00:55:40.841 --> 00:55:42.466
is pretty pissed off with you, you know?

795
00:55:42.550 --> 00:55:44.430
They said I had to swap you
for somebody else...


796
00:55:44.466 --> 00:55:45.966
Oh, don't worry then. Forget...

797
00:57:21.800 --> 00:57:23.383
Let's get the fuck out of here.

798
00:58:01.550 --> 00:58:03.216
Hey! Hey!

799
00:58:05.300 --> 00:58:07.008
- Godo evening.
- Where to?


800
00:58:07.091 --> 00:58:08.883
- Wherever you're going.
- All right. Hop in.


801
00:58:12.758 --> 00:58:15.050
Get on! Come on! Quick!

802
00:59:11.133 --> 00:59:16.466
MUNICIPAL BUS COMPANY
DEPOT "A"


803
00:59:48.716 --> 00:59:50.466
End of the line. Off you get.

804
00:59:50.550 --> 00:59:51.925
"End of the line."

805
00:59:59.841 --> 01:00:01.675
- Bye.
- Goodbye.


806
01:00:01.758 --> 01:00:03.800
- Have a good night.
- Good night.


807
01:00:10.466 --> 01:00:11.800
Whoo!

808
01:00:21.383 --> 01:00:23.050
Whoo!

809
01:00:24.633 --> 01:00:25.758
Oh fuck!

810
01:00:38.300 --> 01:00:43.300
THE PARTY LISTENS TO THE PEOPLE

811
01:00:54.675 --> 01:00:57.008
Who does that arsehole think you are, huh?

812
01:00:57.091 --> 01:01:01.008
He said the country was offended
by the dress I wore


813
01:01:01.716 --> 01:01:04.800
so he said he was gonna
have to sack me for it.


814
01:01:05.633 --> 01:01:06.716
He's out for revenge.

815
01:01:08.175 --> 01:01:10.383
Pathetic little shit.

816
01:01:12.133 --> 01:01:13.133
So what now?

817
01:01:16.633 --> 01:01:17.633
Don't know.

818
01:01:20.425 --> 01:01:22.841
- Why didn't you talk it through...
- And sleep with him?


819
01:01:23.841 --> 01:01:25.175
It wouldn't do any harm.

820
01:01:27.383 --> 01:01:30.508
You have to go and confront him,
not just whine about...


821
01:01:30.591 --> 01:01:33.716
Oh, so you've confronted Janusz
for cheating on you, have you?


822
01:01:40.008 --> 01:01:43.341
Sorry, Xymena,
I didn't mean to sound so blunt.


823
01:01:43.425 --> 01:01:46.383
No, but you were.
And I'm sure you're right.


824
01:01:46.466 --> 01:01:47.508
Xymena!

825
01:01:49.758 --> 01:01:50.966
Xymena!

826
01:02:34.925 --> 01:02:36.526
Oh, so you're here then.

827
01:02:36.550 --> 01:02:38.008
I was at the shops.

828
01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:41.550
What did you do that for, though?
I've already been.


829
01:02:41.633 --> 01:02:44.091
I bought bread, butter, and eggs
on your account.


830
01:02:44.175 --> 01:02:47.008
Just been shopping at the market.
So what's wrong now?


831
01:02:47.091 --> 01:02:48.258
Why did you buy eggs?

832
01:02:48.341 --> 01:02:50.633
I've bought eggs
from the farm like we agreed.


833
01:02:50.716 --> 01:02:53.758
And veal, and chicken,
because that was your order.


834
01:02:55.008 --> 01:02:58.216
That's what I ordered?
I haven't got any money on me.


835
01:02:58.925 --> 01:03:01.175
But you told me yourself
I had to go to the shops.


836
01:03:01.258 --> 01:03:02.966
- I never said that, though.
- Yeah!


837
01:03:03.050 --> 01:03:05.442
You said to me, "Before you clean,
go and do the shopping..."


838
01:03:05.466 --> 01:03:06.300
No, I didn't.

839
01:03:06.383 --> 01:03:10.300
I only came into town to see you so
I'm not going anywhere till you settle up.


840
01:03:11.050 --> 01:03:12.841
Same here. I want my money.

841
01:03:15.508 --> 01:03:16.508
So...

842
01:03:17.341 --> 01:03:19.925
Fuck's sake. Where's my husband?

843
01:03:25.258 --> 01:03:27.966
I'm being extorted by the veal woman
and the housemaid.


844
01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:35.258
So we're going to pay, right?

845
01:03:36.966 --> 01:03:39.008
Staś, you go talk to them.

846
01:03:40.383 --> 01:03:42.425
- I'd rather stay out of it.
- Why is that?


847
01:03:43.050 --> 01:03:44.841
- Because I'm a man.
- Ah.


848
01:03:47.341 --> 01:03:49.008
He's scared of old women.

849
01:03:50.133 --> 01:03:51.633
He thought you had the money.

850
01:03:52.966 --> 01:03:55.008
I don't have any money. 
I'm stone broke.

851
01:03:58.841 --> 01:04:00.050
Well, so am I.

852
01:04:02.008 --> 01:04:04.633
Well, I can't help.
If I could have, I would do it.


853
01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:07.758
That's very generous, Tadzio.

854
01:04:08.508 --> 01:04:10.300
I have bigger fish to fry.

855
01:04:11.716 --> 01:04:13.300
What are you doing here anyway?

856
01:04:15.300 --> 01:04:16.508
My phone's not working.

857
01:04:17.258 --> 01:04:19.675
So I came over
to talk to Stanisław in person.


858
01:04:31.591 --> 01:04:33.175
We can't just sit here forever.

859
01:04:35.508 --> 01:04:36.550
Who says we can't.

860
01:04:43.175 --> 01:04:44.258
Good morning.

861
01:04:45.425 --> 01:04:47.925
What are you ladies doing
waiting out here?


862
01:04:48.008 --> 01:04:50.591
I'm not leaving here
until I get the money I'm owed.


863
01:04:50.675 --> 01:04:53.258
The same goes for me.
I'm not going anywhere.


864
01:04:53.341 --> 01:04:54.591
Right. Let's see.

865
01:04:56.175 --> 01:04:57.508
So...

866
01:04:58.216 --> 01:04:59.216
For you.

867
01:05:00.966 --> 01:05:02.133
And for you.

868
01:05:02.216 --> 01:05:03.216
Is that enough?

869
01:05:03.841 --> 01:05:06.133
Oh yes. Thank you.

870
01:05:12.758 --> 01:05:16.258
Oh, it's so good to see you.
We were trapped in the living room.


871
01:05:16.341 --> 01:05:19.633
What do you mean "trapped"?
Was the door locked?


872
01:05:19.716 --> 01:05:20.716
What door?

873
01:05:20.758 --> 01:05:21.883
The living room door.

874
01:05:21.966 --> 01:05:26.258
Oh, sweety.
You really are a <i>s</i> illy boy.


875
01:05:45.841 --> 01:05:48.591
You know this is a pool,
don't you? For swimming in.


876
01:05:48.675 --> 01:05:51.966
I don't have to.
I can just watch you splash.


877
01:05:52.466 --> 01:05:53.466
Uh-huh.

878
01:05:53.925 --> 01:05:56.216
So you're happy just not doing anything?

879
01:05:56.300 --> 01:05:58.008
Yes, quite happy, thank you.

880
01:06:00.508 --> 01:06:04.425
I'm getting used to doing nothing now
apart from cooking and cleaning.


881
01:06:04.508 --> 01:06:06.966
Oh, for God's sake! Kalina!

882
01:06:08.675 --> 01:06:11.675
So then why don't you give Jeremi a call?
He should stick up for you...


883
01:06:11.758 --> 01:06:16.216
I'm not calling anyone, all right?
Asking for help is humiliating.


884
01:06:16.300 --> 01:06:18.091
You sound just like Staś.

885
01:06:18.175 --> 01:06:20.050
Stop pretending
like you don't care, will you?


886
01:06:20.133 --> 01:06:21.383
Leave me alone.

887
01:06:23.258 --> 01:06:24.675
Just come for a swim.

888
01:06:25.341 --> 01:06:26.591
I don't want to swim.

889
01:06:29.341 --> 01:06:31.425
- Where are you going?
- Leave me alone.


890
01:06:31.508 --> 01:06:33.216
I don't feel like swimming.

891
01:06:43.925 --> 01:06:46.300
I'll leave you alone.
Just promise me one thing.


892
01:06:46.383 --> 01:06:47.383
And what's that?

893
01:06:47.466 --> 01:06:50.466
- That you'll call Jeremi.
- God, you're stubborn. You really are!


894
01:07:28.550 --> 01:07:30.425
Ah! Here's our star.

895
01:07:37.633 --> 01:07:39.591
I really like these hats.

896

Kalina! Kalina!

917
01:09:46.258 --> 01:09:48.800
- Kalina! Hello.
- Oh, Wacław!


918
01:09:49.841 --> 01:09:50.925
Good evening.

919
01:09:51.008 --> 01:09:52.925
- Very nice to meet you.
- Wacław Turski.


920
01:09:53.008 --> 01:09:54.758
Pleasure. Hello.

921
01:09:56.425 --> 01:09:59.091
Now, Kalina, come and tell us
exactly what happend. Come on.


922
01:09:59.175 --> 01:10:01.300
- Come with me. Come on.
- Wacek! What are you doing?


923
01:10:11.258 --> 01:10:14.300
- Come on, only you can settle this.
- You're crazy, as usual.


924
01:10:14.383 --> 01:10:18.841
Do you remember that time when Rysiek
tripped over in the middle of a show...


925
01:10:18.925 --> 01:10:21.925
Good evening, Ms Nina. You look beautiful.

926
01:10:22.008 --> 01:10:24.175
Oh, thank you. 
That's very kind of you.

927
01:10:32.716 --> 01:10:34.383
Kalina, come on. 
Don't you remember?

928
01:10:34.466 --> 01:10:37.966
Right there, in the middle of the show,
Rysiek tripped on a part of the set


929
01:10:38.050 --> 01:10:40.300
and fell flat on his face. Remember?

930
01:10:40.383 --> 01:10:42.550
And then you used your dress
to cover him up


931
01:10:42.633 --> 01:10:45.466
and starting inventing some nonsense
to say to me and I...


932
01:10:45.550 --> 01:10:48.550
and I said something
totally daft to you in return.


933
01:10:48.633 --> 01:10:51.008
It happened, didn't it?
Because Rysiek's denying it.


934
01:10:58.925 --> 01:11:00.841
You're drunk, Wacek.

935
01:11:00.925 --> 01:11:04.466
It's not Rysiek you're thinking of.
It was actually Waldek Górski.


936
01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:14.300
I should go and mingle. Bye.

937
01:11:16.925 --> 01:11:19.758
Uh, would either of you
like another drink?


938
01:11:20.341 --> 01:11:21.883
- No.
- No, thank you.


939
01:11:26.550 --> 01:11:28.550
There you are, Kalina.

940
01:11:28.633 --> 01:11:30.776
- How you doing?
- What do you think of tonight's show?


941
01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:33.508
It was good. That girl has real talent.

942
01:11:34.175 --> 01:11:36.550
Those crew neck dresses were beautiful,
weren't they, babe?


943
01:11:36.633 --> 01:11:39.591
- You didn't really like them, did you?
- Why? What's wrong with them?


944
01:11:39.675 --> 01:11:42.341
- It's just not your style.
- No? That's interesting.


945
01:11:42.425 --> 01:11:45.508
You'd show your tits out there. Like this.

946
01:11:49.258 --> 01:11:50.258
What is your problem?

947
01:11:52.966 --> 01:11:55.442
I'm sorry, but you really haven't
left me any choice, have you?


948
01:12:20.216 --> 01:12:23.883
I admit I'm a little rusty,
but still, that was kinda perfect.


949
01:12:23.966 --> 01:12:26.675
Oh, good for you.
Well, I'm sure it felt wonderful.


950
01:12:26.758 --> 01:12:29.300
Once you're a boxer
then you're always a boxer.


951
01:12:29.383 --> 01:12:31.758
You should have
let me wallop him too like this.


952
01:12:31.841 --> 01:12:33.716
Hey! Don't do that.

953
01:12:34.425 --> 01:12:35.425
Why not?

954
01:12:37.716 --> 01:12:39.633
How do you think it looks?

955
01:12:41.425 --> 01:12:42.675
How does what look?

956
01:12:42.758 --> 01:12:45.508
It's not really very womanly
to go around punching people.


957
01:12:46.925 --> 01:12:48.383
If I was attracted to boxers

958
01:12:48.466 --> 01:12:51.800
then I, well, might have married
my sparring partner.


959
01:13:01.633 --> 01:13:05.716
So you're saying a woman can't really
defend herself because it looks ugly?


960
01:13:06.466 --> 01:13:09.008
Just leave it to the men.
We're ugly already.


961
01:13:09.716 --> 01:13:13.258
So what should I do then?
Just shut up and look pretty?


962
01:13:15.300 --> 01:13:18.716
I don't need you to save me.
I'll save myself! You hear me?


963
01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:20.466
Oh, it's you again.

964
01:13:20.550 --> 01:13:21.633
Are you listening to me?

965
01:13:21.716 --> 01:13:23.841
Yelling in the street, as usual.

966
01:13:24.383 --> 01:13:26.966
Look, no offence,
but you can't even save yourself


967
01:13:27.050 --> 01:13:28.675
from our grumpy neighbour, can you?

968
01:13:28.758 --> 01:13:29.800
What was that?

969
01:13:32.300 --> 01:13:34.341
You don't know
what the fuck you're talking about.


970
01:13:35.841 --> 01:13:37.881
Kalina, don't be stupid.
Where are you going?


971
01:13:37.925 --> 01:13:39.175
Nowhere.

You watch me.

989
01:16:23.633 --> 01:16:25.425
Hello, Jeremi.

990
01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:29.758
Yes, so I was wondering

991
01:16:31.216 --> 01:16:34.550
is there any chance
we could meet up tomorrow?


992
01:16:35.175 --> 01:16:36.175
At SPATiF?

993
01:16:38.591 --> 01:16:40.758
Yeah? That's great. At noon?

994
01:16:41.883 --> 01:16:42.883
Bye then.

995
01:16:43.633 --> 01:16:44.633
See you soon.

996
01:16:51.841 --> 01:16:53.341
I'm meeting him tomorrow.

997
01:16:55.008 --> 01:16:56.675
You don't give up, do you?

998
01:16:57.341 --> 01:16:58.341
No, I don't.

999
01:16:58.883 --> 01:17:01.216
Then don't you dare tell Staś about this.

1000
01:17:15.633 --> 01:17:16.633
Hello.

1001
01:17:18.508 --> 01:17:22.633
Kalina, I'm sorry.
I waited in SPATiF for over an hour.


1002
01:17:22.716 --> 01:17:25.425
It's me who should be sorry.
But I'm glad I found you.


1003
01:17:26.216 --> 01:17:28.841
- Have you started the rehearsals yet?
- We have.


1004
01:17:28.925 --> 01:17:32.675
Yes, actually we've just opened
our songs and sketches workshop.


1005
01:17:33.383 --> 01:17:36.675
- What are they shooting?
<i>- The Newsreel.</i>


1006
01:17:36.758 --> 01:17:37.758
Ah.

1007
01:17:40.008 --> 01:17:41.133
Listen, Jeremi...

1008
01:17:41.216 --> 01:17:43.341
I was wondering
if you might be able to talk.


1009
01:17:43.425 --> 01:17:45.300
Good afternoon, Mr Jeremi!

1010
01:17:48.758 --> 01:17:49.758
Oh.

1011
01:17:51.966 --> 01:17:53.341
And what's she here for?

1012
01:17:54.341 --> 01:17:55.675
She's performing.

1013
01:17:57.925 --> 01:18:01.425
But she isn't the
new Autumn Girl, is she?

1014
01:18:02.591 --> 01:18:04.466
Sorry. My hands are tied.

1015
01:18:05.841 --> 01:18:07.716
No worry. It's really not your fault.

1016
01:18:09.258 --> 01:18:12.050
I'm sure you did your best,
my dearest poet.


1017
01:18:15.841 --> 01:18:16.841
Rysiek!

1018
01:18:18.841 --> 01:18:20.050
You're a piece of shit.

1019
01:18:31.716 --> 01:18:33.425
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.


1020
01:19:13.050 --> 01:19:14.091
And that's ten.

1021
01:19:17.383 --> 01:19:19.633
Hello, there. How'd it go?

1022
01:19:20.133 --> 01:19:21.133
Hi, there.

1023
01:19:24.591 --> 01:19:25.591
Ah.

1024
01:19:27.425 --> 01:19:29.425
Kalina! How'd it go?

1025
01:19:29.508 --> 01:19:30.508
It went fine.

1026
01:19:32.216 --> 01:19:34.341
Eight over nine. Bravo.

1027
01:19:34.925 --> 01:19:37.591
So what did Jeremi say?
Are you back on television?


1028
01:19:46.591 --> 01:19:49.300
I told you
not to talk about it in front of Staś.


1029
01:19:49.383 --> 01:19:51.383
Jesus! Why are you afraid of him?

1030
01:19:51.466 --> 01:19:53.591
I'm not afraid. 
Why would I be?

1031
01:19:54.175 --> 01:19:56.401
Don't get angry with me.
I'm just asking you how it went.


1032
01:19:56.425 --> 01:19:57.591
It went badly.

1033
01:19:59.258 --> 01:20:02.383
- Why? Because you were late?
- Oh, spare me the lecture.


1034
01:20:03.008 --> 01:20:06.383
- But you're always late...
- Fine! I was late. I'm always late.


1035
01:20:06.966 --> 01:20:08.216
What is your problem?

1036
01:20:09.591 --> 01:20:11.675
Kalinka, you have to do something.

1037
01:20:11.758 --> 01:20:13.591
No, I don't have to do anything.

1038
01:20:16.341 --> 01:20:17.841
I'm gonna call Jeremi.

1039
01:20:22.633 --> 01:20:23.841
I already saw him.

1040
01:20:24.466 --> 01:20:26.841
And? Well, tell me how it went?

1041
01:20:27.466 --> 01:20:28.466
No.

1042
01:20:33.341 --> 01:20:36.341
I think it's probably time you went home.

1043
01:20:37.466 --> 01:20:38.466
What for?

1044
01:20:43.341 --> 01:20:44.883

1068

Excuse me.

01:23:05.508 --> 01:23:09.716
<i>But please stay calm. There are
no burning buildings in the capital.</i>

That's Kalina Jędrusik.

01:23:37.633 --> 01:23:39.050
They're yummy.

1078
01:23:45.175 --> 01:23:48.758
<i>The number of silver screen
enthusiasts is constantly growing.</i>


1079
01:23:48.841 --> 01:23:52.008
<i>And now the nation
is buying television sets en masse,</i>


1080
01:23:52.091 --> 01:23:53.133
<i>and who can blame them?</i>

1081
01:23:53.216 --> 01:23:57.175
<i>The Distinguished Gentlemen's Cabaret
is currently in rehearsal.</i>


1082
01:23:57.258 --> 01:24:00.341
<i>Their program is a closely guarded secret.</i>

1083
01:24:00.425 --> 01:24:02.925
<i>However, we can tell you
that there will be some changes</i>


1084
01:24:03.008 --> 01:24:05.050
<i>to the cast and characters.</i>

1085

"Women have the singular ability

1102
01:25:56.425 --> 01:26:00.758
to emit a wide repertoire
of passive-aggressive sighs."


1103
01:26:01.966 --> 01:26:03.925
"In a strictly formal sense,

1104
01:26:04.591 --> 01:26:06.966
the sighs are intended to express the idea

1105
01:26:07.050 --> 01:26:09.508
that women
are weak, helpless, and tormented."


1106
01:26:09.591 --> 01:26:13.383
"However, they also hold therein
a form of insult."


1107
01:26:14.216 --> 01:26:16.675
"A secret, ultimate insult."

1108
01:26:16.758 --> 01:26:20.091
Why don't you write
something about men for a change, huh?


1109
01:26:46.508 --> 01:26:47.550
You understand?

1110
01:26:48.341 --> 01:26:51.633
Now, go and apologise.
Apologise to Henio, you bully.


1111
01:26:54.591 --> 01:26:56.341
Don't you fucking dare touch him!

1112
01:26:59.716 --> 01:27:02.508
You mind your own business.
You're not even his mother.


1113
01:27:05.508 --> 01:27:08.425
Look at me when I'm talking to you.
Now, you go and apologise to him.


1114
01:27:08.508 --> 01:27:10.800
You take your fucking hands off him!
Do you hear me?


1115
01:27:10.883 --> 01:27:11.883
Oh.

1116
01:27:13.425 --> 01:27:15.175
He should apologise to my son.

1117
01:27:16.466 --> 01:27:18.026
- Did you do anything wrong?
- No, not me.


1118
01:27:18.050 --> 01:27:19.050
Then we're done here.

1119
01:27:19.091 --> 01:27:20.675
It wasn't my fault.

1120
01:27:22.258 --> 01:27:26.675
Come on, Henio. Time to go.
This woman should be in the madhouse.


1121
01:27:29.216 --> 01:27:30.050
Come on.

1122
01:27:30.133 --> 01:27:32.966
Did you see the look
on his mum's face?


1123
01:27:38.800 --> 01:27:39.800
What was all that about?

1124
01:27:39.841 --> 01:27:43.883
It's 'cause Heniek was saying
that planes aren't able to land on water.


1125
01:27:43.966 --> 01:27:45.716
But they can, can't they?

1126
01:27:46.341 --> 01:27:48.633
That's right. And you did brilliantly.

1127
01:27:48.716 --> 01:27:49.925
Let's go. It's freezing.

1128
01:28:08.466 --> 01:28:10.216
Can I fix my makeup here?

1129
01:28:10.300 --> 01:28:11.425
Sure, come in.

1130
01:28:14.800 --> 01:28:15.883
What's wrong?

1131
01:28:15.966 --> 01:28:18.425
Everyone's out there dancing
and you're having a bath.


1132
01:28:19.966 --> 01:28:21.508
I don't want to dance.

1133
01:28:22.466 --> 01:28:23.383
That bad?

1134
01:28:23.466 --> 01:28:25.466
I just don't know what I did wrong.

1135
01:28:26.675 --> 01:28:28.383
Nothing's wrong with you.

1136
01:28:29.050 --> 01:28:30.425
He is the crazy one.

1137
01:28:30.508 --> 01:28:33.091
He's been firing people
left, right, and centre.


1138
01:28:33.175 --> 01:28:34.175
Even Nina.

1139
01:28:35.175 --> 01:28:36.175
Who's Nina?

1140
01:28:37.091 --> 01:28:39.175
His secretary. 
The skinny one.

1141
01:28:39.925 --> 01:28:41.258
What for?

1142
01:28:41.341 --> 01:28:42.466
What for?

1143
01:28:45.466 --> 01:28:48.591
Don't think about him.
Don't give him the satisfaction.


1144
01:28:49.133 --> 01:28:50.675
Come on, let's dance.

1145
01:28:53.716 --> 01:28:55.508
I'll just finish my cigarette.

1146
01:29:27.758 --> 01:29:29.438
You know, I love
it when you're like that.

1147
01:29:29.508 --> 01:29:31.425
- Like what?
- You know, dangerous.


1148
01:29:31.508 --> 01:29:32.383
Cheers!

1149
01:29:34.133 --> 01:29:35.383
Ah!

1150
01:29:54.508 --> 01:29:55.841
Good morning, Ms Kalina.

1151
01:29:55.925 --> 01:29:56.925
You can't go in!

1152
01:29:57.883 --> 01:30:00.383
Entry to the building
is for employees only!


1153
01:30:00.466 --> 01:30:02.383
Now please leave!

1154
01:30:02.466 --> 01:30:05.925
Oh, so that's how it is, is it?
Well, now you're in trouble.


1155
01:30:09.966 --> 01:30:11.591
Xymena, come with me.

1156
01:30:11.675 --> 01:30:13.508
Kalina? What are you doing here?

1157
01:30:13.591 --> 01:30:16.216
I'm gonna settling things with Molski.
Come with me.


1158
01:30:16.300 --> 01:30:18.716
- Why?
- Come on, I need you.


1159
01:30:18.800 --> 01:30:20.508
Don't even think about it, sister.

1160
01:30:20.591 --> 01:30:22.758
- Kalina, stop it.
- That nun is following me.


1161
01:30:22.841 --> 01:30:25.216
That's Jadźka Zawadzka. 
She's an actress.

1162
01:30:26.341 --> 01:30:27.341
You're right.

1163
01:30:28.133 --> 01:30:31.091
You see?
See what that bastard's done to me?


1164
01:30:31.175 --> 01:30:34.675
I'm sorry. I thought you were another nun.

1165
01:30:47.716 --> 01:30:48.716
I'm going in.

1166
01:30:49.466 --> 01:30:50.966
What are you going to do?

1167
01:30:52.966 --> 01:30:54.508
Give him a piece of my mind.

1168
01:30:55.258 --> 01:30:57.675
Sounds good. What do I do then?

1169
01:30:58.175 --> 01:30:59.175
Nothing.

1170
01:30:59.633 --> 01:31:02.133
Nothing? Then what am I here for?

1171
01:31:03.300 --> 01:31:05.175
I just need to know that you're here.

1172
01:31:05.925 --> 01:31:07.466
- So I just stand here?
- Yeah.


1173
01:31:08.591 --> 01:31:09.925
- That's it?
- That's it.


1174
01:31:16.133 --> 01:31:17.591
Got the wrong number!

1175
01:31:19.050 --> 01:31:20.050
Right.

1176
01:31:34.258 --> 01:31:35.758
Why did you fire her?

1177
01:31:36.633 --> 01:31:38.925
Nina.

1178
01:31:40.925 --> 01:31:42.341
What did she ever do to you?

1179
01:31:42.425 --> 01:31:44.800
You can't be in here. Get out.

1180
01:31:44.883 --> 01:31:47.425
What is wrong with you, Rysiek?

1181
01:31:47.508 --> 01:31:50.216
Are you going to destroy
every girl who turns you down?


1182
01:31:57.175 --> 01:31:59.341
- She isn't "every girl".
- Oh.


1183
01:32:00.175 --> 01:32:01.841
So you're in love.

1184
01:32:03.716 --> 01:32:06.508
Fuck, you can't even fall in love
like a normal person.


1185
01:32:07.133 --> 01:32:09.258
There's no comparison between you and her.

1186
01:32:09.341 --> 01:32:10.341
- Oh?
- Yeah.


1187
01:32:10.925 --> 01:32:11.925
Why is that?

1188
01:32:12.883 --> 01:32:13.966
You're provocative.

1189
01:32:14.050 --> 01:32:16.050
And you are vulgar.

1190
01:32:16.925 --> 01:32:18.341
Of course.

1191
01:32:19.716 --> 01:32:21.258
She's modest and innocent.

1192
01:32:23.633 --> 01:32:24.966
Isn't it funny?

1193
01:32:26.425 --> 01:32:28.508
How the same thing
still happens to us both.


1194
01:32:32.800 --> 01:32:35.925
It's actually quite a feat
to have such nerve.


1195
01:32:39.341 --> 01:32:40.341
Yeah.

1196
01:32:45.841 --> 01:32:47.008
I'll see you soon then

1197
01:32:48.508 --> 01:32:50.050
whether you like it or not.

1198
01:32:50.591 --> 01:32:51.716
The best of luck.

1199
01:32:51.800 --> 01:32:53.841
- Oh! Ms Jędrusik!
- Sorry...


1200
01:32:53.925 --> 01:32:56.050
I came to tell comrade Molski about you.

1201
01:32:56.966 --> 01:32:58.550
You've won.

1202
01:32:59.175 --> 01:33:01.591
The Wieczornego Express
conducted a survey.


1203
01:33:01.675 --> 01:33:03.591
It's a great success! Huge!

1204
01:33:03.675 --> 01:33:05.050
You've won the Golden Mask!

1205
01:33:05.133 --> 01:33:08.508
It's not official yet, but I got a call
from the editor-in-chief.


1206
01:33:08.591 --> 01:33:11.883
And one minute the people
were angry with you, now they love you.


1207
01:33:13.258 --> 01:33:15.258
So, Ms Kalinka?

1208
01:33:16.633 --> 01:33:18.300
Can you forgive us?

1209
01:33:20.758 --> 01:33:21.758
I'll think about it.

1210
01:33:21.841 --> 01:33:23.591
If there's anything we can do.

1211
01:33:26.425 --> 01:33:29.925
Well, I do have... some conditions.

1212
01:33:30.008 --> 01:33:32.716
Comrade Molski
will take care of everything.


1213
01:33:33.591 --> 01:33:35.508
I'll start with a pay rise.

1214
01:33:36.550 --> 01:33:39.925
It's been quite chilly recently
and my coat's a little old.


1215
01:33:40.675 --> 01:33:42.008
I'd like to buy a fur.

1216
01:33:44.800 --> 01:33:48.341
Go and draw up
the contract, will you... Molski?


1217
01:34:00.716 --> 01:34:02.258
- Hello.
- Hello.


1218
01:34:06.883 --> 01:34:09.175
Anything smaller?
I don't have any change.


1219
01:34:12.966 --> 01:34:15.550
Everyone calm down
and wait their turn.


1220
01:34:17.258 --> 01:34:19.591
- Excuse me, I'm in a hurry.
- Oh, no, you don't!


1221
01:34:19.675 --> 01:34:22.109
Well, you might be happy
to wait in line all day, but I'm not.


1222
01:34:23.383 --> 01:34:25.591
- It's Kalina Jędrusik.
- Excuse me. Excuse me.


1223
01:34:25.675 --> 01:34:28.692
Hey, if you're so important
what are you doing in a shop like this?


1224
01:34:28.716 --> 01:34:30.300
Buying bread? I don't think so.

1225
01:34:30.383 --> 01:34:32.008
Of course not. 
I'm buying champagne.

1226
01:34:32.091 --> 01:34:34.192
Drinking Champagne
in the middle of the day!


1227
01:34:34.216 --> 01:34:36.883
I'm not drinking it.
I'm bathing it. There.


1228
01:34:36.966 --> 01:34:38.300
A 134 zlotys.

1229
01:34:38.383 --> 01:34:40.800
- You can keep the change. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.


1230
01:34:40.883 --> 01:34:43.008
- Goodbye!
- Bye!


1231
01:34:48.341 --> 01:34:49.341
Mm-hmm.

1232
01:34:52.300 --> 01:34:54.508
I'll have to stop you there, Tadzio.

1233
01:34:55.216 --> 01:34:58.800
Kalina's just come home and
she's bought two bottles of champagne.


1234
01:35:03.425 --> 01:35:05.466
No, I can't see any caviar.

1235
01:35:09.966 --> 01:35:12.341
But she does look
rather pleased with herself.


1236
01:35:15.966 --> 01:35:19.216
Oh! You hear that, Tadzio?

1237
01:35:20.841 --> 01:35:23.216
Tadzio says to tell you
that I'm a monster.


1238
01:35:23.300 --> 01:35:25.425
But he understands you,
because he loves me too.


1239
01:35:28.175 --> 01:35:31.841
Hold on. Hold on. Sorry, Tadzio.
I'll call you back, okay?
