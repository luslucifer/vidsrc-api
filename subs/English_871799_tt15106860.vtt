- Yeah.


331
00:32:12.014 --> 00:32:13.854
There's a lot of product
that was seized, Jack.


332
00:32:13.933 --> 00:32:17.186
It's not... it's not like a small deal.

333
00:32:18.437 --> 00:32:20.564
- It's, uh...
- I'm well aware of the problem.


334
00:32:22.483 --> 00:32:23.567
Come on, spit it out.

335
00:32:25.569 --> 00:32:27.154
I know it was Rick.

336
00:32:27.238 --> 00:32:29.281
- You personally know?
- Yes.


337
00:32:30.866 --> 00:32:33.261
- Rick has been sending...
- Hey, hey, hey, hold on a minute.

How do you know?

339
00:32:34.703 --> 00:32:41.001
Rick has been sending
information to my father.


340
00:32:43.045 --> 00:32:44.046
What kind of information?

341
00:32:44.130 --> 00:32:46.465
Personal information, Jack,

342
00:32:46.549 --> 00:32:48.717
that my father has no business knowing.

343
00:32:48.801 --> 00:32:51.053
Hmm. I understand.

344
00:32:53.681 --> 00:32:55.724
Okay, so it's Rick's...

345
00:32:55.808 --> 00:33:00.104

of you and your boyfriend.


346
00:33:00.187 --> 00:33:03.649
I mean, that's a violation
of your personal sovereignty,


347
00:33:03.732 --> 00:33:06.569
but how the fuck does that mean
he's talking to the feds?


348
00:33:09.738 --> 00:33:11.532
Because I value our friendship,

349
00:33:11.615 --> 00:33:13.677
- it's important that I come here...
- Hold that thought.


350
00:33:13.701 --> 00:33:16.078
- To tell you your face... I have to.
- Hold that thought.

00:33:16.162 --> 00:33:18.042
I'll get you a refill.
That was the cheap stuff.

I heard what happened to your partner.

00:38:22.718 --> 00:38:26.054
I assure you we're gonna do everything
we can to find out what the hell happened.


396
00:38:26.138 --> 00:38:27.764
I'd like to stick around to help.

00:38:27.848 --> 00:38:30.851
All right. All right, we can do that.

398
00:38:32.769 --> 00:38:34.605
We already have
some history here with Carter,


399
00:38:34.688 --> 00:38:38.609
so we're gonna let you act
as liaison with my office.

All right? In the meantime,
why don't you go get some shuteye,

Yes, sir.

the same thing about you.

He wasn't a very good cop.

848
01:18:01.594 --> 01:18:03.888
I found him one morning

washing blood off of his hands
that wasn't his.

I didn't wanna believe him.

You're a good man, breslin.

this town will eat you alive.

And, oh! Now I ran the rest

You got city council members on there,
you got sheriff dodge.

It's not an easy fix.

Now the only thing they saw

01:19:23.718 --> 01:19:27.597
was a late model mustang
driving away after the gunfire.
