1
00:00:29.427 --> 00:00:30.954
Hello, hello, this is Johnny Rizzo

2
00:00:31.091 --> 00:00:35.848
joining you on the overnight
on the K-Spot, sports talk, KSPT!


3
00:00:35.987 --> 00:00:37.929
How's everyone doing tonight?
I'm gonna be with you


4
00:00:38.067 --> 00:00:40.685
from 2:00 to 6:00
for all you insomniacs out there


5
00:00:40.818 --> 00:00:42.411
that have a lot to talk about.

6
00:00:42.547 --> 00:00:45.449
So let's jump right in
and take our first caller.


7
00:00:45.587 --> 00:00:47.048
Brian, from Danville.

8
00:00:47.186 --> 00:00:49.423
How you doing, my man?
What would you like to talk about?


9
00:00:49.554 --> 00:00:51.857
Look, I know our beloved A's
aren't having the best summer.


10
00:00:51.987 --> 00:00:54.508
But unlike some other guys,
I'm not gonna use my air time


11
00:00:54.644 --> 00:00:56.848
to rip them apart, all right?
I'm a loyal fan.


12
00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:59.849
Instead, I'm gonna encourage everyone
going out to the Coliseum tonight


13
00:00:59.988 --> 00:01:03.730
to show a little support, okay?
Send a little love to my man Gio;


14
00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:05.136
spread the love, not the hate.

15
00:01:05.267 --> 00:01:07.372
Don't get me started
on the Warriors, okay?


16
00:01:07.508 --> 00:01:09.896
I'm already hella-mad
the way they treated Mullin.


17
00:01:10.036 --> 00:01:12.424
I'm not just saying that
because Chris, like myself,


18
00:01:12.564 --> 00:01:13.993
is another transplanted New Yorker,

19
00:01:14.132 --> 00:01:15.822
I'm saying it because
he was a class act.


20
00:01:15.956 --> 00:01:18.345
You really want to talk steroids
scandal with me? That's fine.


21
00:01:18.484 --> 00:01:21.134
I know what you're gonna say
and I'm not being too harsh -


22
00:01:21.268 --> 00:01:22.926
look, when a player takes steroids,

23
00:01:23.059 --> 00:01:25.328
they are violating
the integrity of the game.


24
00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:26.921
It's cheating. Okay?
So, look, fellas,


25
00:01:27.059 --> 00:01:29.263
you wanna take a banned substance,
go for it.


26
00:01:29.396 --> 00:01:31.665
But that means
no hall of fame for you.


27
00:01:31.795 --> 00:01:33.137
The Tour de France! Really?

28
00:01:33.267 --> 00:01:35.505
You want me
to talk about bike riding?


29
00:01:35.636 --> 00:01:37.938
This is a sports show! Next caller!

30
00:01:38.068 --> 00:01:39.497
Whoop, that's my fiancÃ©e.

31
00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:44.014
<i>- She says you gotta hustle off.
You've got a flight to catch.</i>


32
00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:45.610
- It's 6:00 already! Wow!

33
00:01:45.748 --> 00:01:48.334
Time flies when you're having fun,
sports fans.


34
00:01:48.468 --> 00:01:51.054
This is Johnny Rizzo
saying goodbye, good morning!


35
00:01:51.188 --> 00:01:52.464
I'm out!

36
00:01:54.068 --> 00:01:55.442
Good show, good show!

37
00:01:59.348 --> 00:02:00.625
See you, Jimmy.

38
00:02:13.268 --> 00:02:15.788
Just give me 10 minutes!
Please, 10 minutes!


39
00:02:17.749 --> 00:02:19.058
Hey, baby.
- Hi.


40
00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:20.498
- I'm late! I'm late. I'm sorry.

41
00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:23.018
- I dunno why you decided
to work last night, Johnny.


42
00:02:23.157 --> 00:02:25.361
You're gonna miss your flight.
The cab's already here.


43
00:02:25.494 --> 00:02:27.217
- I know. I saw him.
- And you forgot


44
00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:28.397
to pack your suit, didn't you?

45
00:02:28.533 --> 00:02:30.158
- No, I did. It's in there.
- And a tie?


46
00:02:30.294 --> 00:02:32.977
'Cause this is a business meeting
with businessmen,


47
00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:35.531
not a whole bunch of sports nerds.
Seriously, you need to wear a suit.


48
00:02:35.669 --> 00:02:37.840
- Baby, I'm gonna wear a suit,
just not a tie.


49
00:02:37.974 --> 00:02:40.876
- Okay. I think
you look really good in a suit.


50
00:02:41.013 --> 00:02:43.184
All right, come here
and say goodbye to me.


51
00:02:46.581 --> 00:02:49.581
Thank you, thank you,
thank you so much for doing this.


52
00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:52.971
And I know it's not how you envisioned
your career going,


53
00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:54.222
but if you get this job,

54
00:02:54.357 --> 00:02:56.658
we're going to be back in New York
right after the honeymoon.


55
00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:58.960
Right? It's a good thing.
- Yeah...


56
00:02:59.093 --> 00:03:00.883
- Now give me a kiss.
- I gotta go.


57
00:03:02.262 --> 00:03:05.459
- Okay, you can go now.
Ahem. Um...


58
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.867
Do you really want to wear that hat?
It sorta makes you look like a toddler.


59
00:03:10.006 --> 00:03:12.462
- I like the hat.
- Um... no. Take it off.


60
00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.878
Okay, and you have dinner
with my parents on Sunday night.


61
00:03:17.014 --> 00:03:18.029
- Right.
- And please


62
00:03:18.166 --> 00:03:19.791
call my father ''Dr. 
Meadows,'' okay?

63
00:03:19.926 --> 00:03:22.992
He does not like to be called ''Mister.''
Can you remember that?


64
00:03:23.126 --> 00:03:26.290
- I called him ''Mister'' one time.
- Yeah, and it really pissed him off.


65
00:03:26.422 --> 00:03:28.244
- He's only a shrink, though.
- Whoa.


66
00:03:28.374 --> 00:03:31.407
Okay, look, it's the least you can do
considering he got you


67
00:03:31.542 --> 00:03:33.135
this job interview.
- Fair enough.


68
00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.571
- All right, here's the address
for the shop.


69
00:03:35.702 --> 00:03:39.182
That's in Nolita, which is downtown.
It's not too far from the hotel. Okay?


70
00:03:39.317 --> 00:03:40.943
- Got it. I promise.
- Thank you.


71
00:03:41.078 --> 00:03:42.933
All right.
- I love you. I'll see you.


72
00:03:43.061 --> 00:03:45.429
I'll call you when I get there, yeah?
Cool.


73
00:03:46.071 --> 00:03:49.267
<i>It's a voice in
the back of your mind</i>

74
00:03:50.775 --> 00:03:52.685
<i>Oh oh oh oh oh oh</i>

75
00:03:53.431 --> 00:03:56.300
<i>It's a song
It's a beautiful rhyme</i>


76
00:03:57.751 --> 00:03:59.824
<i>Oh oh oh oh oh oh</i>

77
00:04:00.471 --> 00:04:03.951
<i>It gets louder and louder each time</i>

78
00:04:04.951 --> 00:04:07.187
<i>Oh oh oh oh oh oh</i>

79
00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.019
<i>It's a sign that
you find me all right</i>

80
00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.500
<i>Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Step outside and off the bus</i>


81
00:04:16.631 --> 00:04:20.493
<i>There's more to life
there's more to us</i>


82
00:04:20.631 --> 00:04:23.860
<i>The window is open wide</i>

83
00:04:25.271 --> 00:04:27.028
<i>Open for more</i>

84
00:04:27.896 --> 00:04:30.743
<i>Oh oh oh
Open for more</i>


85
00:04:30.871 --> 00:04:32.497
<i>Oh oh oh</i>

86
00:04:32.631 --> 00:04:34.573
<i>Open for more</i>

87
00:04:34.711 --> 00:04:36.173
<i>Oh oh oh</i>

88
00:04:36.311 --> 00:04:38.002
<i>Open for more</i>

89
00:04:38.135 --> 00:04:39.662
<i>Oh oh oh</i>

90
00:04:52.472 --> 00:04:55.057
- Hey, hey! Look who's back!
- Terry!


91
00:04:55.192 --> 00:04:58.737
- There he is!
All right, buddy, sit your ass down.


92
00:04:58.872 --> 00:05:01.588
- Thank you, sir.
- Have yourself a drink.


93
00:05:02.231 --> 00:05:04.500
And do me a favour,
take off that ridiculous hat.


94
00:05:04.632 --> 00:05:06.257
You're in New York now, all right?

95
00:05:06.872 --> 00:05:08.977
- Actually, can I grab a beer?
Is that okay?


96
00:05:09.111 --> 00:05:11.217
- No, you're not gonna have a beer,
you're gonna have a real drink


97
00:05:11.352 --> 00:05:13.327
and we're gonna have a real conversation
about what's really going on.


98
00:05:13.464 --> 00:05:15.886
- What do you mean,
''what's really going on?''


99
00:05:16.025 --> 00:05:18.807
- You're getting married in a few weeks
and I'd like to know why exactly.


100
00:05:18.937 --> 00:05:20.693
- Because I love her?

101
00:05:20.825 --> 00:05:22.712
- Because you love her.
Look, that goes without saying.


102
00:05:22.841 --> 00:05:25.175
But that doesn't mean
you have to marry her, my man.


103
00:05:25.305 --> 00:05:27.825
So what happened? You got
caught up in the moment one night,


104
00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.967
go deep, forget to throw a glove on?
- No.


105
00:05:30.105 --> 00:05:33.138
No, no. I always ''throw a glove on,''
thank you for your concern.


106
00:05:33.272 --> 00:05:36.469
Just, uh... I think it's a good time.
- Look,


107
00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.258
take it from one who's been there.

108
00:05:38.393 --> 00:05:40.662
Never a good time.
- Oh, great.


109
00:05:40.792 --> 00:05:42.647
- Never!
- I disagree.


110
00:05:42.776 --> 00:05:44.369
See, I think If you love someone,
why wait?


111
00:05:44.504 --> 00:05:45.552
You should just go for it,

112
00:05:45.688 --> 00:05:47.892
you know, get on with your life.
- Get on with your life?


113
00:05:48.024 --> 00:05:49.780
Listen to yourself, young blood,
all right?


114
00:05:49.912 --> 00:05:52.727
Life is like a marathon.
It's not the 100-yard dash.


115
00:05:52.857 --> 00:05:55.760
It's like that single-malt scotch
I just poured you, right?


116
00:05:55.897 --> 00:05:58.744
You sip it. You don't shoot it.
- Colourful.


117
00:05:58.873 --> 00:06:01.077
But I'm not a young blood anymore,
Uncle Terry.


118
00:06:01.209 --> 00:06:03.249
I'm gonna be 25 next month.

119
00:06:03.385 --> 00:06:05.687
- Well, la-di-fucking-da.
Twenty-five? My man,


120
00:06:05.817 --> 00:06:09.134
these are your prime years
to go out there and make it happen.


121
00:06:09.274 --> 00:06:12.983
Did you not notice all the fine ass
on the street walking over here?


122
00:06:13.114 --> 00:06:14.575
- Yeah, I noticed
all the fine ass on the street.


123
00:06:14.713 --> 00:06:15.826
- I actually don't think you did,

124
00:06:15.961 --> 00:06:18.776
because there's a bevy of horny honeys
out there and you know what they want?


125
00:06:18.905 --> 00:06:20.760
- What do they want?
- They want their pound of flesh.


126
00:06:20.889 --> 00:06:22.929
And you know who they're expecting
to give it to them?


127
00:06:23.065 --> 00:06:24.724
- Who are they expecting's
gonna give it to them?


128
00:06:24.857 --> 00:06:25.784
- You.
- Me? No, you!


129
00:06:25.913 --> 00:06:28.498
You can, okay? Be my guest.
I'm not that guy.


130
00:06:28.633 --> 00:06:30.967
Besides, Claire and I
have been together since college.


131
00:06:31.097 --> 00:06:32.472
I love her.
- Whoa, whoa.


132
00:06:32.601 --> 00:06:35.896
You have been with the same chick
since college?


133
00:06:36.025 --> 00:06:37.968
- Yeah. You met her, actually,
at my graduation party.


134
00:06:38.106 --> 00:06:40.310
- This is heartbreaking, Johnny.
That is the only piece of ass


135
00:06:40.442 --> 00:06:42.777
you've had since then?
- Okay, she's not a piece of ass.


136
00:06:42.906 --> 00:06:44.248
All right? That's my fiancÃ©e.
- Fine.


137
00:06:44.378 --> 00:06:45.939
My apologies, all right?
- Okay.


138
00:06:46.074 --> 00:06:49.172
- But here's what your Uncle Terry
is gonna do for you this weekend.


139
00:06:49.306 --> 00:06:51.193
All right, a little wedding gift for you.

140
00:06:51.322 --> 00:06:53.525
I'm gonna take you out,
get you some strange.


141
00:06:53.658 --> 00:06:56.025
- No, I don't really need
that wedding gift. I'm good, thanks.


142
00:06:56.154 --> 00:06:58.358
- How about I
get you a BJ, then.

143
00:06:58.490 --> 00:06:59.897
I know some chick--
- BJ!?


144
00:07:00.026 --> 00:07:01.553
No BJ! No. All right?

145
00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:03.599
Claire takes care of me.
- Fine.


146
00:07:03.738 --> 00:07:06.105
All right... Here's a thought instead.

147
00:07:06.234 --> 00:07:08.143
You're going out to your mother's
for lunch tomorrow, right?


148
00:07:08.282 --> 00:07:09.689
- Right...
- So what do you say


149
00:07:09.818 --> 00:07:11.640
you let me drive you out there,

150
00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:13.680
afterwards, we'll power out
to the Hamptons


151
00:07:13.818 --> 00:07:15.192
for the weekend?
- It sounds like fun,


152
00:07:15.321 --> 00:07:16.565
uncle Terry. It does.
It's just...


153
00:07:16.698 --> 00:07:18.770
I got some errands
I told Claire I would run.


154
00:07:18.906 --> 00:07:21.460
- Wh-what kind of errands
do you have to run for Claire?


155
00:07:21.595 --> 00:07:24.628
- She wants me to pick up
a handbag, or something,


156
00:07:24.763 --> 00:07:26.324
at some special shop downtown.

157
00:07:26.459 --> 00:07:27.866
- Okay, my man, that settles it.

158
00:07:27.995 --> 00:07:30.548
I am picking you up at your hotel,

159
00:07:30.682 --> 00:07:33.203
tomorrow morning.
- I know what you're trying to do,


160
00:07:33.339 --> 00:07:35.379
Uncle Terry,
and I'm not interested, okay?


161
00:07:35.515 --> 00:07:37.042
- Wait, you're not interested

162
00:07:37.179 --> 00:07:40.725
in spending a little quality time
with your uncle?


163
00:07:40.859 --> 00:07:42.997
What would you rather do?
You're gonna spend two days


164
00:07:43.131 --> 00:07:45.520
in your shitty hotel room and do what?
I'm offended, man.


165
00:07:45.659 --> 00:07:47.568
- Okay, you don't stop, do you?
Thank you for the drink.


166
00:07:47.707 --> 00:07:48.601
I appreciate it.

167
00:07:48.731 --> 00:07:50.705
- Look, I wanna spend
a little time with my nephew!


168
00:07:50.842 --> 00:07:52.501
That such a bad thing?
- Next time. Okay?


169
00:07:52.635 --> 00:07:54.936
I'm gonna take the train to my mom's,
then I'm gonna get some rest.


170
00:07:55.067 --> 00:07:58.002
- What better way to get some rest
than to hang poolside with your uncle?


171
00:07:58.139 --> 00:08:00.277
Listen to me,
I'm not taking no for an answer.


172
00:08:00.794 --> 00:08:02.387
- All right. Okay. 9:00 a.m.?

173
00:08:02.522 --> 00:08:04.149
- Let's make it 10:00, all right?

174
00:08:04.283 --> 00:08:06.771
Just to be safe.
And do me a favour, lose the hat, okay?


175
00:08:06.908 --> 00:08:09.461
You're too young to get married,
and too old for that fucking hat.


176
00:08:09.595 --> 00:08:12.148
- Right. Thank you.
I'll see you tomorrow, all right?


177
00:08:26.075 --> 00:08:27.504
- There he is!

178
00:08:28.795 --> 00:08:30.584
What do you say, buddy?
- What's going on?


179
00:08:30.715 --> 00:08:32.276
- How you doing, man?
- What's your deal?


180
00:08:32.412 --> 00:08:33.524
You did say 10:00.

181
00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:36.049
Because I said 9:00,
you said 10:00, then--


182
00:08:36.188 --> 00:08:38.970
- I apologize, I got a, uh...
I got a phone call last night


183
00:08:39.099 --> 00:08:41.238
from this girl I know.
She's out in Jersey, so...


184
00:08:41.371 --> 00:08:43.705
You could say I hit
a little tunnel traffic this morning,


185
00:08:43.836 --> 00:08:45.877
if you know what I mean.
- Tunnel traffic. Nice.


186
00:08:46.013 --> 00:08:46.940
- Look, by the way,

187
00:08:47.069 --> 00:08:48.596
what the hell are you
doing staying in this dump?


188
00:08:48.733 --> 00:08:50.456
- I got a good deal online, so...
- Do me a favour,


189
00:08:50.589 --> 00:08:52.825
next time you come to New York,
do your uncle a favour,


190
00:08:52.956 --> 00:08:54.898
give me a call,
let me hook you up, okay?


191
00:08:55.037 --> 00:08:56.946
- All right. Thank you. Thanks.

192
00:08:57.436 --> 00:08:59.705
Look, you don't mind
if we head downtown first, right?


193
00:08:59.836 --> 00:09:01.724
Pick up the handbag?
- Let me ask you a question.


194
00:09:01.852 --> 00:09:03.740
What would happen if you returned home
without this... pocketbook?


195
00:09:03.868 --> 00:09:05.690
- Well, I wouldn't be
a man of my word.


196
00:09:05.821 --> 00:09:07.643
Would I?
- A man of your word?


197
00:09:07.773 --> 00:09:10.587
- Yeah, I told Claire I'd pick it up.
So I should really honour that promise.


198
00:09:10.717 --> 00:09:14.743
- Okay. Well, I'd hate for you
to have to compromise your integrity.


199
00:09:14.876 --> 00:09:16.818
Let's go get your bag.

200
00:09:29.597 --> 00:09:32.150
- There. Took like two seconds.
- Yeah, you're a standup guy.


201
00:09:32.286 --> 00:09:34.871
Can we go now?
- Yes. Did you get me one?


202
00:09:35.518 --> 00:09:37.460
- You like ice cream?

203
00:09:49.277 --> 00:09:50.291
Johnny, listen to me.

204
00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:52.284
I don't want to spend
a lot of time here, all right?


205
00:09:52.413 --> 00:09:54.584
'Cause I told the ladies
we'd get out to the beach by 4:00.


206
00:09:54.717 --> 00:09:55.645
- Ladies?
What are you talking about?


207
00:09:55.773 --> 00:09:57.781
You said it was just gonna be us
hanging by the pool.


208
00:09:57.917 --> 00:09:59.575
- Yeah, it is
just going to be us.

209
00:09:59.709 --> 00:10:01.814
And this sweet little thing
I met last week, so...


210
00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:04.338
- No, you said ''ladies.''
You said ''ladies'' just now. Plural.


211
00:10:04.478 --> 00:10:06.583
- Look, I'm assuming
she must have some friends.


212
00:10:06.717 --> 00:10:09.946
Or maybe one friend in particular,
who I heard is very hot.


213
00:10:10.077 --> 00:10:11.932
Look, I know,
you don't even need to talk to her.


214
00:10:12.062 --> 00:10:13.819
I know you don't roll that way.
So it's cool.


215
00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:14.997
Don't even worry about it.

216
00:10:15.134 --> 00:10:16.989
- No, that's not cool!
That's not cool, Uncle Terry, okay?


217
00:10:17.118 --> 00:10:18.940
If you're trying to set me up,
I'm not down.


218
00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:21.078
Don't be a dickwad!
- What do you mean a ''dickwad?''


219
00:10:21.214 --> 00:10:23.319
- You're being a dickwad, okay!
If that's what you have planned,


220
00:10:23.454 --> 00:10:26.803
I'm not going!
- I'm joking around with you, all right?


221
00:10:26.942 --> 00:10:28.349
- A toast, to Johnny.

222
00:10:28.478 --> 00:10:30.301
I'm so proud of you,

223
00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:31.772
my baby boy.

224
00:10:31.902 --> 00:10:33.658
Agreeing to take this job.

225
00:10:33.791 --> 00:10:36.343
That takes courage.
- What is this job


226
00:10:36.478 --> 00:10:38.420
that you two are so excited about?

227
00:10:38.558 --> 00:10:40.729
<i>- It's a good opportunity.
- No, it's a great opportunity.</i>


228
00:10:40.862 --> 00:10:41.811
- It's a good opportunity.

229
00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:43.837
It's something Claire set up for me -
or her dad, rather.


230
00:10:43.966 --> 00:10:46.170
- You know what I'm not hearing
in your voice at all? Excitement.


231
00:10:46.302 --> 00:10:49.597
- Yeah, it's not exactly what I wanna be
doing, but the money's potentially good.


232
00:10:49.726 --> 00:10:52.759
Gets me back to New York. So...
- Yes, and that makes his mother


233
00:10:52.894 --> 00:10:55.228
very happy. Right?
- And Claire and I have an agreement


234
00:10:55.358 --> 00:10:58.174
that, um, when I turn 25,
if I'm not making $50,000,


235
00:10:58.303 --> 00:11:00.637
I'd let her dad set me up
with an interview


236
00:11:00.767 --> 00:11:02.807
at his friend's company.
- Whoa, wait a second.


237
00:11:02.943 --> 00:11:05.365
So this job has nothing to do
with sports or radio,


238
00:11:05.503 --> 00:11:06.877
or anything that you care about?

239
00:11:07.007 --> 00:11:08.468
- No. It's, um...

240
00:11:08.606 --> 00:11:13.146
for Moving Made Easy Cardboard
Box and Corrugated Products.


241
00:11:13.279 --> 00:11:17.469
- They do boxes, packing supplies,
shipping cartons, things of that nature.


242
00:11:17.598 --> 00:11:20.184
It's a great opportunity, Johnny.
- To say nothing of the benefits.


243
00:11:20.319 --> 00:11:23.167
- It's cardboard fucking boxes, though?
I heard that correctly?


244
00:11:23.295 --> 00:11:26.165
Cardboard boxes?
What the fuck are you thinking, man?!


245
00:11:26.303 --> 00:11:29.499
- Hey, it's a good job. And good money.
- It's not. Know what a good job is?


246
00:11:29.631 --> 00:11:31.703
Talking sports on the radio.
That's a great job.


247
00:11:31.839 --> 00:11:34.425
Every other dude in America
would love to have that gig


248
00:11:34.559 --> 00:11:35.933
and you're gonna walk away from that?!

249
00:11:36.063 --> 00:11:37.623
- Clogging the airways
with mindless debates


250
00:11:37.758 --> 00:11:40.476
about who should be batting fifth
in the Giants lineup?


251
00:11:40.608 --> 00:11:43.869
It's hardly a job. 
It's a hobby at best.

252
00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.658
- Yeah, I'm with you guys.
It's an awesome job.


253
00:11:45.792 --> 00:11:47.865
Okay, I love it.
But it's not gonna pay the bills.


254
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.723
- So you move
into a smaller apartment.


255
00:11:49.856 --> 00:11:51.896
Eat out less.
Take the bus on occasion.


256
00:11:52.032 --> 00:11:53.657
- Right.
- You realize you're encouraging him


257
00:11:53.792 --> 00:11:56.312
to stunt his personal growth?
To remain a child.


258
00:11:56.448 --> 00:11:58.619
Do you really want him
to end up like you?


259
00:11:58.752 --> 00:12:00.345
Still running around
like some horny teenager?


260
00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:02.236
- Hey, jealousy
will get you nowhere, Frank.


261
00:12:02.367 --> 00:12:05.051
- Are you insinuating
I wanna sleep with other women?


262
00:12:05.184 --> 00:12:07.867
I'm married to your sister,
you animal.


263
00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.072
- Let me ask you a question.
Why are you doing this?


264
00:12:10.207 --> 00:12:12.346
- I gave her my word,
Uncle Terry, okay?


265
00:12:12.479 --> 00:12:15.229
- If I'm not making $50,000--
- Yeah, yeah. I know.


266
00:12:15.359 --> 00:12:17.814
Who came up with this timeline for you?
- We did.


267
00:12:17.952 --> 00:12:19.839
- Bullshit!
- We did together, okay?


268
00:12:19.968 --> 00:12:22.554
- Why do you need
to be making $50,000 right now?


269
00:12:22.688 --> 00:12:23.616
- Because he's getting married!

270
00:12:23.744 --> 00:12:26.875
And they wanna start a family, you know.
And all that costs money.


271
00:12:27.009 --> 00:12:28.700
- This is bad, Johnny.
This is real bad.


272
00:12:28.833 --> 00:12:31.615
I do not like what I'm hearing at all.
This whole job situation,


273
00:12:31.745 --> 00:12:33.533
not a good thing.
- I appreciate the thought.


274
00:12:33.665 --> 00:12:36.414
But I dunno why we're talking
about this. I've made my mind up.


275
00:12:36.545 --> 00:12:39.294
On Monday, I'm going to the interview
and if I'm lucky, I'll get the job.


276
00:12:39.424 --> 00:12:41.694
- Atta boy!
- All right, guys, well, thank you.


277
00:12:41.825 --> 00:12:44.127
That was a blast, as always.
- Bye.


278
00:12:44.256 --> 00:12:47.223
Hey, listen. No funny business
with your uncle, okay?


279
00:12:47.361 --> 00:12:50.110
No wild parties.
- Mm-hmm. We got it.


280
00:12:50.241 --> 00:12:52.248
- He's a good boy. Don't corrupt him.
- Don't worry about it.


281
00:12:52.385 --> 00:12:54.938
We're just gonna get some sun, alright?
- Listen,


282
00:12:55.072 --> 00:12:57.974
call me on Monday after your interview.
I wanna hear how it goes. Bye.


283
00:12:58.112 --> 00:12:59.803
- You got it. I love you.
- Be good.


284
00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:02.102
That's to you!
- Cheer up, Frank!


285
00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:03.833
It's not that bad, buddy!

286
00:13:08.961 --> 00:13:10.936
Now, look,
I know she's you're mother, okay?


287
00:13:11.074 --> 00:13:14.587
She's also my sister and I know her
a little bit better than you.


288
00:13:14.721 --> 00:13:16.150
Take it easy, sis!

289
00:13:17.121 --> 00:13:19.707
She wants you to get a blowjob
this weekend.


290
00:13:19.841 --> 00:13:21.303
- Really?
- You know that.


291
00:13:21.441 --> 00:13:23.546
- Really? That's nice. 
That's my mom.

292
00:13:23.681 --> 00:13:26.463
<i>But you got a smile</i>

293
00:13:26.594 --> 00:13:28.154
<i>On you honey</i>

294
00:13:29.121 --> 00:13:33.431
<i>And you got eyes
that'll light up the night</i>


295
00:13:34.305 --> 00:13:36.378
<i>Now they're winnin'me over</i>

296
00:13:36.513 --> 00:13:39.360
<i>Lettin'me know</i>

297
00:13:39.489 --> 00:13:42.424
<i>There's something else</i>

298
00:13:42.561 --> 00:13:44.252
<i>Something more...</i>

299
00:13:44.385 --> 00:13:46.043
So this lady friend we're visiting,

300
00:13:46.177 --> 00:13:48.480
obviously not the same one
from last night?


301
00:13:49.346 --> 00:13:51.201
- What can I say, man?
I'm a lucky man.


302
00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:53.665
- So I guess it's safe to assume
this isn't gonna blossom


303
00:13:53.794 --> 00:13:55.420
into a serious
and meaningful relationship.


304
00:13:55.554 --> 00:13:59.099
- Well, as serious and meaningful as
one can get with someone who's married.


305
00:13:59.235 --> 00:14:02.584
- Wow! You know what?
Good for you. Good for you, Uncle Terry.


306
00:14:02.722 --> 00:14:05.886
- Look, as shocking as this may sound,
man, it happens all the time.


307
00:14:06.018 --> 00:14:08.985
- But don't you feel bad for her husband?
- Her husband? Uh... no.


308
00:14:09.122 --> 00:14:12.122
Why exactly would I feel badly for him?
- Because he probably doesn't know


309
00:14:12.258 --> 00:14:15.073
someone's having sex with his wife.
- Yeah, I should fucking hope not!


310
00:14:15.202 --> 00:14:17.089
- No, it's wrong, Uncle Terry.
It's cheating! It's cheating.


311
00:14:17.219 --> 00:14:19.706
You're engaging in deceit and deception.
That can't feel good for you.


312
00:14:19.842 --> 00:14:23.072
- It feels fine. In fact, I got a hard-on
right now thinking about it.


313
00:14:23.202 --> 00:14:24.631
- Oh, wow. That's nice.

314
00:14:28.002 --> 00:14:30.238
- All right... finally here!

315
00:14:30.882 --> 00:14:32.312
And only an hour late.

316
00:14:36.323 --> 00:14:37.916
- Look, Uncle Terry...

317
00:14:38.883 --> 00:14:41.305
Can I just wait here, please?
- No, you're not gonna wait here.


318
00:14:41.443 --> 00:14:43.483
You're gonna come inside
and say hello like a gentleman.


319
00:14:43.619 --> 00:14:46.040
- Oh, ''like a gentleman.''
That's choice words coming from a guy


320
00:14:46.179 --> 00:14:48.600
that said he had a raging hard-on
a couple minutes ago.


321
00:14:48.739 --> 00:14:51.161
That's a married woman in there, okay?
And you're having an affair


322
00:14:51.299 --> 00:14:53.535
with said married woman.
- I'm not asking you to take pictures!


323
00:14:53.667 --> 00:14:56.983
- And what do you want me to do
when you go in there and start...


324
00:14:57.123 --> 00:14:59.262
fornicating.
- We're not gonna do anything right now.


325
00:14:59.395 --> 00:15:03.192
We're gonna go in and say hello.
Come on. They're out back playing tennis.


326
00:15:03.843 --> 00:15:05.850
- I'm just gonna say hello.
Then I'm gonna leave.


327
00:15:05.987 --> 00:15:07.994
- Where you gonna go?
- Just gonna wait out front.


328
00:15:08.131 --> 00:15:10.814
- Come on. Don't worry.
Got a little surprise back here for you.


329
00:15:10.947 --> 00:15:12.637
I think you're going to enjoy yourself.

330
00:15:16.324 --> 00:15:17.534
There they are.

331
00:15:17.668 --> 00:15:19.490
- Great.
- Oh, Jesus, look at her.


332
00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:23.614
Is that a fucking sight, or what?
- Please tell me your lady friend


333
00:15:23.748 --> 00:15:26.268
is not the young blond?
- No, my man.


334
00:15:26.404 --> 00:15:28.192
She is for you.

335
00:15:28.324 --> 00:15:29.371
Amy!

336
00:15:30.404 --> 00:15:32.313
- Hey, Terry! Back here!

337
00:15:40.324 --> 00:15:42.528
Look at you, breaking a sweat.

338
00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:44.667
- Terry, hey.
- What do you say, doll?


339
00:15:44.804 --> 00:15:47.073
- This must be your nephew.
- This is him.


340
00:15:47.204 --> 00:15:49.790
The nicest guy in showbiz.
Meet DJ Johnny Rizzo.


341
00:15:49.924 --> 00:15:51.233
- I'm Amy.
- Hi.


342
00:15:51.363 --> 00:15:53.273
- And this is Brooke.
My tennis instructor,


343
00:15:53.412 --> 00:15:56.511
who's been having a fine time
kicking my ass all afternoon.


344
00:15:56.644 --> 00:15:58.433
Brooke, Terry, Johnny.
- Hey, guys.


345
00:15:58.565 --> 00:16:01.347
- How are you?
- So why don't you guys hit some balls


346
00:16:01.476 --> 00:16:04.259
while Terry and I run inside real quick.
I... thought maybe


347
00:16:04.389 --> 00:16:07.423
we could talk about that project?
- Oh, the project, yeah. Good idea.


348
00:16:07.557 --> 00:16:10.426
I was actually just telling Johnny
about that project, wasn't I?


349
00:16:10.564 --> 00:16:12.026
- He was.
- All right.


350
00:16:12.165 --> 00:16:13.791
- Come on. Hit 'em dead, pal.

351
00:16:13.925 --> 00:16:15.834
- Have fun.
- See ya.


352
00:16:17.732 --> 00:16:19.226
- Nice choice. She's a knockout.
- Yeah.


353
00:16:19.364 --> 00:16:22.681
But promise me he's not an asshole.
- He's a terrific guy. Sexual dynamo.


354
00:16:22.821 --> 00:16:24.446
Runs in the family.

355
00:16:28.644 --> 00:16:31.514
- So you're a DJ.
- Yep.


356
00:16:31.653 --> 00:16:34.108
- That's cool.
- Uh, yeah. Thanks.


357
00:16:34.245 --> 00:16:36.994
I don't, like, spin records
or anything like that. I, uh...


358
00:16:37.125 --> 00:16:39.230
I have a sports talk show,
in California.


359
00:16:39.364 --> 00:16:41.754
- Oh.
- It's... I do it like in Oakland.


360
00:16:42.405 --> 00:16:44.991
Kinda like a suburb...
- Okay.


361
00:16:45.125 --> 00:16:47.995
- ... Oakland? KSPT. ''The K
-Spot!''

362
00:16:49.925 --> 00:16:53.024
- Well, that's cooler
than if you were, like,


363
00:16:53.157 --> 00:16:56.321
one of those loser nightclub DJs.
- Thank you.


364
00:16:59.206 --> 00:17:01.311
- So what are you doing
in the Hamptons?


365
00:17:01.445 --> 00:17:03.933
- Uh, I have a job interview, actually,
on Monday.


366
00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:05.443
Not for radio, something else.

367
00:17:05.574 --> 00:17:08.890
I got really lucky - my fiancÃ©e's dad
found me a great opportunity.


368
00:17:09.029 --> 00:17:11.877
Make a little bit more money
with some benefits, so...


369
00:17:12.005 --> 00:17:13.631
I'm excited...

370
00:17:13.765 --> 00:17:15.226
- I'm sorry...

371
00:17:15.366 --> 00:17:17.308
Did you just say your fiancÃ©e?
- Yeah.


372
00:17:17.446 --> 00:17:19.551
Yeah, I'm getting married
in a couple of weeks.


373
00:17:19.685 --> 00:17:22.435
- Wow, congratulations!
- Thanks. Thank you.


374
00:17:22.565 --> 00:17:25.283
- So weird, and kind of a relief.
I'm just...


375
00:17:25.926 --> 00:17:28.348
I thought we were being set up.
- Oh, no.


376
00:17:28.486 --> 00:17:30.526
No, no, no, no, no.
No, that's my uncle.


377
00:17:30.662 --> 00:17:33.150
He's an asshole.
He thinks I'm too young to get married.


378
00:17:33.286 --> 00:17:35.108
So he's been bustin' my balls
all weekend.


379
00:17:35.239 --> 00:17:37.279
- Well, are you too young
to be getting married?


380
00:17:37.414 --> 00:17:40.512
- No. No, I'm not too young.
- You look young. How old are you?


381
00:17:40.646 --> 00:17:42.107
Almost 25. Thanks.

382
00:17:42.246 --> 00:17:44.418
- Dude, that is too young
to be getting married.


383
00:17:44.550 --> 00:17:46.939
- That's not too young!
Why does everyone keep saying that?


384
00:17:47.078 --> 00:17:50.461
My parents got married at that age!
-Yeah, how'd that work out for them?


385
00:17:50.599 --> 00:17:53.381
- Okay. Okay, fair enough.
They got divorced when I was eight.


386
00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:55.998
- See? I told you,
too young to get married.


387
00:17:56.134 --> 00:18:00.029
It was the same for me.
My parents got divorced when I was nine.


388
00:18:00.166 --> 00:18:02.752
It's why my shrink says
I only date jerks.


389
00:18:02.886 --> 00:18:04.315
- Ah. Okay.

390
00:18:06.726 --> 00:18:10.556
- Amy said that Terry said
that you are nice to a fault.


391
00:18:11.527 --> 00:18:12.956
- Sounds like him.

392
00:18:13.607 --> 00:18:15.876
- Is that true? 
Are you nice to a fault?

393
00:18:16.007 --> 00:18:18.724
- I dunno. I mean,
is that such a bad thing?


394
00:18:19.975 --> 00:18:22.910
- All right, Nice Guy Johnny,
let's hit some balls.


395
00:18:23.047 --> 00:18:24.835
- Uh... Ooh... Okay.

396
00:18:27.527 --> 00:18:29.949
It's okay.
I didn't think I'd be doing this!


397
00:18:30.087 --> 00:18:32.324
- That one was high.
- Wow, swinging for the fences there.


398
00:18:32.455 --> 00:18:34.910
- I don't really talk about tennis
on my show, but, uh...


399
00:18:35.047 --> 00:18:37.633
I got a new respect for it,
I'll tell you that.


400
00:18:37.767 --> 00:18:40.069
- You should stop talking about sports
and maybe start playing them.


401
00:18:40.199 --> 00:18:43.047
- Thanks.
Thanks for the positive reinforcement.


402
00:18:43.175 --> 00:18:46.142
- How do you have any credibility
with your listeners?


403
00:18:46.887 --> 00:18:49.253
- I didn't know I was gonna
come here to work out.


404
00:18:49.383 --> 00:18:51.391
If I knew I was,
I would've properly prepared.


405
00:18:51.528 --> 00:18:53.797
Working out?

406
00:18:53.928 --> 00:18:56.797
You call that working out?
- This is hard work, yes!


407
00:18:57.608 --> 00:18:59.134
- You're sucking so hard,

408
00:18:59.272 --> 00:19:01.475
is that what's such a workout for ya?

409
00:19:01.608 --> 00:19:03.680
- I'm done.
How do you turn it off?


410
00:19:06.568 --> 00:19:08.390
- You might be a nice guy,

411
00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:10.723
but you're a terrible
fucking tennis player.


412
00:19:11.528 --> 00:19:12.957
Guilty.

413
00:19:18.567 --> 00:19:20.477
It's hard. It's hard.

414
00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:23.840
It was nice meeting you guys.
- Nice to meet you too.


415
00:19:23.975 --> 00:19:25.601
- Take care.
- All right. Bye, guys.


416
00:19:25.736 --> 00:19:27.078
- Pleasure.
- I'll see you later.


417
00:19:27.207 --> 00:19:28.669
- You most definitely will.
- Hmm.


418
00:19:28.808 --> 00:19:30.783
- How was that for you?

419
00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:33.790
- You tell me.
- Oh, awesome. He's engaged.


420
00:19:33.928 --> 00:19:35.237
- No!

421
00:19:35.369 --> 00:19:36.645
Oh, Terry.

422
00:19:37.576 --> 00:19:40.838
- You said we were just gonna say hello.
Why did you have to leave me alone


423
00:19:40.969 --> 00:19:42.976
with some strange girl?
- Strange? What's so strange about her?


424
00:19:43.113 --> 00:19:44.520
She seemed like a delightful young lady.

425
00:19:44.648 --> 00:19:46.471
- She was an awful tennis instructor,
for one thing.


426
00:19:46.601 --> 00:19:48.608
And I know what you're doing,
and I'm not cool.


427
00:19:48.744 --> 00:19:50.567
- What am I trying to do?
- I'm getting married


428
00:19:50.697 --> 00:19:53.544
in a couple of weeks, okay?
I know you don't believe in the vows,


429
00:19:53.673 --> 00:19:55.909
or whatever. But I do.
So I'd appreciate if you'd refrain


430
00:19:56.041 --> 00:19:58.888
from setting me up with people, okay?
- Does that mean no double date tonight?


431
00:19:59.017 --> 00:20:01.253
- That's really funny. Do me a favour?
Quit the bullshit, okay?


432
00:20:01.385 --> 00:20:02.978
- Look, you're allowed
to flirt a little bit.


433
00:20:03.113 --> 00:20:05.960
No one's saying you had to sleep
with the girl, but have some fun.


434
00:20:06.089 --> 00:20:08.510
Walk up to the line.
- No, I don't wanna have any fun,


435
00:20:08.648 --> 00:20:11.070
to walk up to some line.
- Can you please at least admit


436
00:20:11.209 --> 00:20:13.216
you thought she was hot.
I'm not spending my weekend


437
00:20:13.352 --> 00:20:15.360
with some closet fruitcake.
- No, I'm not participating in this.


438
00:20:15.497 --> 00:20:18.564
- I need to know that you can recognize
that was a smoking-hot gorgeous gal.


439
00:20:18.697 --> 00:20:21.763
- No, not doing this with you.
- So you're saying she's a dog?


440
00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:25.796
- She wasn't a dog.
- There he is! All right, there's my guy.


441
00:20:25.929 --> 00:20:27.685
He's not a fruitcake. Let's go.

442
00:20:55.529 --> 00:20:58.398
Jesus, what a freaking gorgeous day, huh?

443
00:21:00.011 --> 00:21:02.728
I hope you brought a suit, my man.
- Yeah, I dunno.


444
00:21:02.858 --> 00:21:05.640
I think I'm gonna go for a jog later.
It's nice.


445
00:21:05.771 --> 00:21:09.218
- All right, suit yourself.
I am gonna have a beer,


446
00:21:09.354 --> 00:21:12.169
smoke a stogie and jump in that pool.

447
00:21:13.674 --> 00:21:16.041
- Oh, Uncle Terry, this is beautiful.

448
00:21:16.170 --> 00:21:18.080
- Ah... thank you, man.

449
00:21:19.210 --> 00:21:22.407
It is a pretty sweet pad, isn't it?
- Yeah, I'm impressed.


450
00:21:23.211 --> 00:21:24.999
- All right, so look, man, uh...

451
00:21:25.131 --> 00:21:28.164
your bedroom is upstairs,
it's the first door on the right.


452
00:21:28.298 --> 00:21:32.706
And I think it actually has pink sheets,
which you are going to love, I imagine.


453
00:21:32.842 --> 00:21:35.395
<i>So make yourself comfortable.
My casa es su casa.</i>


454
00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:37.123
- Thank you.
- I...


455
00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:39.679
... need to go for a swim.

456
00:22:09.451 --> 00:22:10.912
<i>- Hey, baby, it's me.
- Where are you?</i>


457
00:22:11.051 --> 00:22:12.033
I just spoke to your mother.

458
00:22:12.171 --> 00:22:14.081
Why didn't you tell me
you were going to the Hamptons?


459
00:22:14.219 --> 00:22:16.608
- Yeah, I'm sorry.
It was kind of a last-minute decision.


460
00:22:16.747 --> 00:22:19.202
I really didn't know I was going
until like this afternoon.


461
00:22:19.339 --> 00:22:22.339
- So this was just
a spur-of-the-moment decision?


462
00:22:22.475 --> 00:22:24.036
<i>
- Yeah, basically. 
I mean, uh...</i>

463
00:22:24.171 --> 00:22:27.271
my uncle drove me to my parents' house,
then invited me to come, so...


464
00:22:27.404 --> 00:22:29.640
- Okay, did you at least
check out of the hotel?


465
00:22:29.772 --> 00:22:33.285
<i>- No.
- So we are paying for a hotel</i>


466
00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:35.559
<i>that you're not using tonight?
- Yeah. Sorry. Like I said,</i>


467
00:22:35.692 --> 00:22:38.474
it was spur of the moment.
I can call and probably check out,


468
00:22:38.604 --> 00:22:40.841
if you want.
But I have some stuff still there.


469
00:22:40.972 --> 00:22:42.314
<i>Think it'll be a problem?</i>

470
00:22:42.444 --> 00:22:44.332
- Alright.
This is what I'm talking about.


471
00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:47.756
It's all connected. You seriously got
to start behaving like a grownup.


472
00:22:47.884 --> 00:22:50.918
<i>This is exactly why a real job
with real people</i>


473
00:22:51.052 --> 00:22:53.507
<i>will have a real good effect on you.</i>

474
00:22:53.644 --> 00:22:55.619
I'm not being a bitch.
I'm just trying to help.


475
00:22:55.756 --> 00:22:57.000
<i>
- Yeah, it'll have a good effect.</i>

476
00:22:57.132 --> 00:22:59.882
- So... where are you staying?

477
00:23:00.012 --> 00:23:01.289
- At my uncle's.

478
00:23:01.932 --> 00:23:04.234
- How the hell can he afford
a house in the Hamptons?


479
00:23:04.364 --> 00:23:06.633
<i>Is it nice?
- Yeah, actually. It's really nice.</i>


480
00:23:06.764 --> 00:23:09.153
- He's such a fucking sleazebag.
Did I ever tell you he tried


481
00:23:09.293 --> 00:23:11.682
<i>to hit on me at our graduation party?
- What?I No, he didn't.</i>


482
00:23:11.821 --> 00:23:14.025
- Yes, he did. I mean,
he wasn't being overt or anything,


483
00:23:14.157 --> 00:23:16.066
but he was definitely
putting the feelers out there.


484
00:23:16.204 --> 00:23:18.114
- Are you sure?
He was probably just flirting with you.


485
00:23:18.253 --> 00:23:19.463
He's kind of a big flirt.

486
00:23:19.853 --> 00:23:21.314
<i>
- No, I know the difference.</i>

487
00:23:21.452 --> 00:23:23.525
between flirting and getting hit on.
Trust me. Happens all the time.


488
00:23:23.661 --> 00:23:25.155
<i>Okay, whatever, Johnny.</i>

489
00:23:25.292 --> 00:23:28.140
Just, seriously, please promise me
that you will be back in the city


490
00:23:28.269 --> 00:23:30.276
in time for dinner with my parents
tomorrow night.


491
00:23:30.413 --> 00:23:31.787
<i>- Yes, of course.
- Promise?</i>


492
00:23:31.916 --> 00:23:33.127
- Yes. Yes.

493
00:23:33.261 --> 00:23:36.043
- Okay. I love
you and I trust you.

494
00:23:36.173 --> 00:23:37.602
- I love you too.

495
00:23:50.093 --> 00:23:53.923
I just got off the phone with Claire;
you hit on her at our graduation party?


496
00:23:54.062 --> 00:23:56.167
- Who says this?
- Claire.


497
00:23:57.102 --> 00:24:00.168
My fiancÃ©e? Wow, you are an idiot!
You hit on her?


498
00:24:00.302 --> 00:24:02.538
- I did not hit on her!
I... talked to her.


499
00:24:02.670 --> 00:24:04.525
Maybe I flirted with her a little bit.

500
00:24:04.653 --> 00:24:06.246
But come on, who cares?
- I care!


501
00:24:06.381 --> 00:24:08.203
That's my fiancÃ©e! 
That's not cool!

502
00:24:08.334 --> 00:24:11.367
- I'm not allowed to tell a sexy woman
I thought she looked beautiful?


503
00:24:11.502 --> 00:24:15.211
- No! Not when that woman's my fiancÃ©e
and I'm your nephew! That's wrong!


504
00:24:15.342 --> 00:24:17.862
- But it was harmless, man.
I wasn't gonna actually act on it.


505
00:24:17.997 --> 00:24:20.386
- I should hope not!
But I'm not so sure with you.


506
00:24:20.525 --> 00:24:24.038
- Why not just take it as a compliment,
the two of you?


507
00:24:24.173 --> 00:24:26.345
- Thanks for hitting on my fiancÃ©e
to pay me a compliment.


508
00:24:26.478 --> 00:24:28.071
You know what? 
This was a mistake.

509
00:24:28.205 --> 00:24:31.522
I'm gonna go for my jog,
then take the train into the city, okay?


510
00:24:33.613 --> 00:24:35.075
- Fine, man. Fine.

511
00:24:35.214 --> 00:24:37.866
It has been a pleasure, Johnny.
- Yeah.


512
00:24:37.999 --> 00:24:39.526
Thanks for everything, Uncle Terry.

513
00:25:00.814 --> 00:25:02.091
<i>
- Excuse meI</i>

514
00:25:02.222 --> 00:25:04.164
Hey! You!

515
00:25:06.094 --> 00:25:08.712
- What can I do for you?
- You can start by telling me


516
00:25:08.846 --> 00:25:11.050
who you are.
- I don't like your tone at all, pal.


517
00:25:11.183 --> 00:25:13.037
Why don't you tell me
who you are first?


518
00:25:13.167 --> 00:25:17.804
- I'll tell you who I am.
I am the caretaker of this property.


519
00:25:17.934 --> 00:25:20.553
I look after the house
for Roseanne Giordano.


520
00:25:20.688 --> 00:25:23.535
- Good for you. I happen to be
a very dear friend of Roseanne's.


521
00:25:23.663 --> 00:25:26.282
- And I happen to be a very dear friend
of her husband's.


522
00:25:26.415 --> 00:25:28.487
- So maybe you'd like
a fucking medal for that!


523
00:25:28.624 --> 00:25:31.657
- There's no need to get hostile.
I saw a car out front I didn't recognize,


524
00:25:31.791 --> 00:25:34.890
I thought I should come and take a look.
Is that all right with you?


525
00:25:35.023 --> 00:25:38.372
- So aren't you the good neighbour?
Well, now that you have taken a look,


526
00:25:38.511 --> 00:25:40.235
why don't you take a fucking hike,

527
00:25:40.367 --> 00:25:41.796
as well?

528
00:25:41.935 --> 00:25:45.961
- Oh, you are quite rude, aren't you?
Yes, well, I think I'll call Roseanne,


529
00:25:46.095 --> 00:25:49.324
or maybe her husband
and check up on you, Mr. Um...?


530
00:25:49.455 --> 00:25:50.764
- Cunningham.

531
00:25:50.895 --> 00:25:52.488
Terry Cunningham.
- Yes.


532
00:25:52.815 --> 00:25:54.604
All right, well, excuse me for a moment.

533
00:25:54.735 --> 00:25:57.353
- Go make your call.
- Hello, Roseanne.


534
00:25:57.487 --> 00:26:00.170
Yes, sorry to disturb you,
but Terry Cunningham


535
00:26:00.303 --> 00:26:03.687
<i>is here at the house.
- Are you fuckingjoking me?</i>


536
00:26:03.824 --> 00:26:05.929
He's there right now?
- Yes, he's standing there right now,


537
00:26:06.064 --> 00:26:08.236
by the pool, drinking a beer.
What should I do?


538
00:26:08.368 --> 00:26:11.565
<i>Shall I call the cops?
- No, no, no. Don't do that.</i>


539
00:26:11.696 --> 00:26:13.605
Hmm... Let me talk to him.

540
00:26:14.896 --> 00:26:16.009
- All right.

541
00:26:17.456 --> 00:26:19.692
Roseanne would like to talk to you.

542
00:26:21.936 --> 00:26:23.758
<i>- What you say, doll?
- TerryI</i>


543
00:26:23.888 --> 00:26:26.474
What the fuck is going on?
What are you doing at my house?


544
00:26:26.608 --> 00:26:30.252
- Look, I was in the neighbourhood
and I figured I'd come by to say hello.


545
00:26:30.384 --> 00:26:33.133
I knocked on the door
and I thought I heard something,


546
00:26:33.264 --> 00:26:35.020
<i>so I figured I should check it out.</i>

547
00:26:35.152 --> 00:26:37.454
- Right, then you thought
you'd just take a little swim?


548
00:26:37.584 --> 00:26:40.879
- I thought since no one was here,
what would be the harm?


549
00:26:41.008 --> 00:26:42.983
<i>
- Do you realize how stupid this is?</i>

550
00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:45.608
What if my husband
had been there this weekend?


551
00:26:45.745 --> 00:26:48.298
- Then I guess we'd have
some explaining to do, wouldn't we?


552
00:26:48.433 --> 00:26:49.862
<i>
- Hey, I do not appreciate this.</i>

553
00:26:50.897 --> 00:26:53.547
You are taking advantage
of my generosity.


554
00:26:53.681 --> 00:26:55.623
<i>And we've talked about this before.</i>

555
00:26:55.761 --> 00:27:00.103
- Doll, I apologize. Just say the word
and I will leave. No problems.


556
00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:03.208
- You're such a pain in my ass,
you know that?


557
00:27:03.345 --> 00:27:06.214
- Does that mean I have to go,
because I was kinda hoping


558
00:27:06.352 --> 00:27:07.847
<i>I could spend the night.
- No.</i>


559
00:27:07.985 --> 00:27:10.952
You don't have to go.
You can only stay the night, though.


560
00:27:11.089 --> 00:27:12.878
Now let me talk to Mr. Williams.

561
00:27:13.009 --> 00:27:14.416
- With pleasure.

562
00:27:15.248 --> 00:27:17.550
- Oh. Thank you.

563
00:27:17.681 --> 00:27:18.826
Yes?

564
00:27:18.961 --> 00:27:21.230
- He can stay the night.
But you just have to make sure


565
00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:23.913
he's out first thing in the morning.
Can you make sure that happens?


566
00:27:24.049 --> 00:27:25.772
- Yes. How does 8:00 sound?

567
00:27:26.737 --> 00:27:29.127
Very good. Thank you, bye-bye.

568
00:27:30.642 --> 00:27:33.871
- I hope you're pleased with yourself?
- I'm just doing my job.


569
00:27:34.001 --> 00:27:36.390
And I'll have you know,
Roseanne wanted me


570
00:27:36.530 --> 00:27:39.377
to tell you you had to be out of here
by 8:00 a.m.


571
00:27:39.505 --> 00:27:42.767
And wants me to come by in the morning
to make sure you have, in fact, left.


572
00:27:42.898 --> 00:27:45.353
- Nothing would make me happier
than to see your face


573
00:27:45.490 --> 00:27:48.490
at 8:00 a.m. tomorrow morning.
I look forward to it.


574
00:27:50.257 --> 00:27:51.850
- Smart arse, aren't you?

575
00:27:54.257 --> 00:27:55.883
I'll be back.

576
00:27:56.017 --> 00:27:57.511
Eight a.m.

577
00:27:57.649 --> 00:27:59.657
- Yeah, how do you like your eggs?

578
00:28:21.779 --> 00:28:23.535
- Hey...
- Hey!


579
00:28:24.499 --> 00:28:27.248
- What are you doing here?
- What am I doing here?


580
00:28:27.379 --> 00:28:29.037
What are you doing here?
This is my spot.


581
00:28:29.170 --> 00:28:32.170
- Sorry to intrude.
No, I'm just out for a jog.


582
00:28:32.306 --> 00:28:33.167
- You know what you should do,

583
00:28:33.299 --> 00:28:35.241
you should cut that run short
and come have a beer with me.


584
00:28:35.378 --> 00:28:37.931
- Oh, no, no. I'm good.
Thank you, though.


585
00:28:38.930 --> 00:28:42.640
- Oh, come on, it's just a beer.
Light beer, too. Only 95 calories.


586
00:28:42.770 --> 00:28:45.999
You can maintain your girlish figure.
- Oh, thank you.


587
00:28:46.131 --> 00:28:48.269
No. No, I'm engaged. I, uh...

588
00:28:48.403 --> 00:28:51.370
I don't think it would be appropriate.
- Wow!


589
00:28:51.506 --> 00:28:53.513
Don't you think that was
a little presumptuous of you?


590
00:28:53.651 --> 00:28:55.080
It's just a beer.
- I'm just saying...


591
00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:58.351
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that.
I'm just... I'm just saying.


592
00:28:58.483 --> 00:29:01.167
- Come on, don't be such a fucking wuss.
Come have a beer with me.


593
00:29:02.739 --> 00:29:05.227
- All right, one beer.
One beer, if you put it that way.


594
00:29:05.363 --> 00:29:07.054
- Grab a chair right here.
- You got it.


595
00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:09.453
- You got it?
- Thank you, yes.


596
00:29:09.939 --> 00:29:11.051
- All right...

597
00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:12.976
Here we go.

598
00:29:14.419 --> 00:29:15.980
- Oh, it's nice.
- Yeah.


599
00:29:16.115 --> 00:29:18.897
Look at those guys playing paddleball...

600
00:29:35.379 --> 00:29:37.802
<i>Sunshine</i>

601
00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:39.565
<i>She's Aquarius</i>

602
00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:41.936
<i>What what what a sign</i>

603
00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:44.562
<i>She came from the sky</i>

604
00:29:44.692 --> 00:29:46.602
<i>Oh oh oh oh</i>

605
00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:49.423
<i>She came from the sky
Oh oh oh oh</i>


606
00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:53.133
<i>Just like rain</i>

607
00:29:55.220 --> 00:29:57.292
<i>Just like rain</i>

608
00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:01.292
<i>Just like rain</i>

609
00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:04.907
<i>Just like rain</i>

610
00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:10.926
- Cold?
- Yeah, you should've joined me.


611
00:30:11.060 --> 00:30:12.816
<i>- No, thank you.
Just like</i>


612
00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:15.049
- You have a fresh beer?

613
00:30:15.188 --> 00:30:16.977
- Yes, I do.
- Ready?


614
00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:19.693
- Ah...

615
00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:21.715
- Cheers.
- Cheers.


616
00:30:26.261 --> 00:30:28.530
So what's the deal,
you live here year-round or...?


617
00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:32.272
- Oh, no, me and my best friend from
school came out here for the summer.


618
00:30:32.405 --> 00:30:34.314
Her parents have a place
over in Montauk.


619
00:30:34.453 --> 00:30:36.111
- Oh, yeah?
Where'd you go to school?


620
00:30:36.245 --> 00:30:37.771
- Loyola Marymount - in L.A.?
- Yeah!


621
00:30:37.908 --> 00:30:40.243
I went to San Francisco State.
- Really?


622
00:30:40.373 --> 00:30:43.090
- Did you play tennis for them?
- Sure did.


623
00:30:43.221 --> 00:30:45.326
All Conference, singles and doubles.
- Wow!


624
00:30:45.461 --> 00:30:47.850
- In fact, I was a seeded player.

625
00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:51.952
But I gave it all up
for some jerk I was seeing.


626
00:30:52.085 --> 00:30:54.768
So that put an end to that dream.

627
00:30:54.901 --> 00:30:58.446
- I'm sorry. So that means
you're like a real jock, then.


628
00:30:58.581 --> 00:31:01.647
- Ah, my father wouldn't have it
any other way.


629
00:31:01.781 --> 00:31:04.651
- You know what?
I would love to get you on my show.


630
00:31:05.462 --> 00:31:07.982
Yeah. Yeah, I'd like to do
an interview, is that all right?


631
00:31:08.118 --> 00:31:10.835
I think it'd be really cool.
We could talk about how a, uh...


632
00:31:10.966 --> 00:31:11.980
college athlete, once they graduate,

633
00:31:12.117 --> 00:31:14.768
what happens then their sport
is no longer the centre of universe.


634
00:31:14.901 --> 00:31:17.171
I think that'd be kinda good.
Would you be down for that?


635
00:31:17.302 --> 00:31:18.927
- You must be hard up for guests.

636
00:31:19.062 --> 00:31:21.331
- Well, I go on air at 2:00 a.m.
So yeah, kinda.


637
00:31:21.461 --> 00:31:24.429
- Uh, my father'll be thrilled.
- All right.


638
00:31:24.566 --> 00:31:26.770
Okay. Okay, you got a deal.

639
00:31:26.902 --> 00:31:28.331
- Okay.
- Sold!


640
00:31:30.134 --> 00:31:32.785
- Hey, what if you end up
taking this job on Monday?


641
00:31:32.918 --> 00:31:35.885
I'm gonna miss out
on my 15 minutes of fame, aren't I?


642
00:31:36.021 --> 00:31:38.258
- Yeah... Yeah, I guess so.

643
00:31:38.934 --> 00:31:41.803
- All right, well, then, I am definitely
voting against that job.


644
00:31:42.741 --> 00:31:44.236
- You wouldn't be the only one,
believe me.


645
00:31:44.374 --> 00:31:46.763
- So what is this new career
opportunity anyhow?


646
00:31:46.902 --> 00:31:48.845
- Mm-mm. No, no, no.
If I tell you,


647
00:31:48.983 --> 00:31:50.576
you're gonna think
I'm a complete jackass.


648
00:31:50.711 --> 00:31:53.166
- It can't be that bad. What is it?
- Oh, it's that bad.


649
00:31:53.302 --> 00:31:54.611
- What is it?

650
00:31:54.743 --> 00:31:58.059
- It is for a warehouse-supervisor
position,


651
00:31:58.198 --> 00:32:02.573
for Moving Made Easy
Cardboard Box and Corrugated Products.


652
00:32:04.022 --> 00:32:06.478
- You cannot be serious?
- I'm serious. I'm serious.


653
00:32:06.615 --> 00:32:11.601
Look, it's not as cool as my DJ position,
but it easily triples my salary, so...


654
00:32:11.735 --> 00:32:16.012
- Listen, I know I just met you
and I do not know a thing about you,


655
00:32:16.150 --> 00:32:18.834
but just promise me
you will not take that job.


656
00:32:18.966 --> 00:32:21.901
I don't care how much they say
they're gonna pay you.


657
00:32:22.039 --> 00:32:24.014
- Yeah... It's a little late for that.

658
00:32:24.151 --> 00:32:25.744
But thank you for your concern.

659
00:32:37.303 --> 00:32:39.692
Well... thank you for the beer.

660
00:32:39.831 --> 00:32:42.897
This was nice. But I'm gonna head back.
I'm gonna try and make a train


661
00:32:43.031 --> 00:32:44.493
back into the city tonight.
- Oh, really?


662
00:32:45.143 --> 00:32:48.209
Are you sure you don't wanna stick
around? 'Cause me and my friends


663
00:32:48.343 --> 00:32:51.660
are having a bonfire down at the beach.
We're gonna grill up some food


664
00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:54.004
and drink a little beer,
smoke a little weed...


665
00:32:54.135 --> 00:32:55.379
- Yeah, no. No, thank you.

666
00:32:55.511 --> 00:32:57.333
It sounds like fun, though.
- Oh, well...


667
00:32:57.463 --> 00:33:00.146
Could be your last chance
of a wild and crazy night


668
00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:03.247
before you spend the rest of your life
neck-deep in cardboard.


669
00:33:03.383 --> 00:33:06.732
- Ah-ha. That's funny.
No, I'll take a rain check, though.


670
00:33:07.703 --> 00:33:09.264
- Suit yourself.
- All right.


671
00:33:09.399 --> 00:33:11.821
You can take these yourself?
- Oh, yeah, I got it.


672
00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:13.454
- Great, I'll see ya.
- Yeah, bye.


673
00:33:18.104 --> 00:33:21.650
Hey, if you change your mind,
we'll be over at Georgica Beach!


674
00:33:21.784 --> 00:33:23.061
- All right.

675
00:33:23.384 --> 00:33:24.813
I'll see ya.

676
00:33:29.241 --> 00:33:31.761
<i>If you want to save the world
you better find yourself a girl</i>


677
00:33:31.896 --> 00:33:33.936
<i>Who doesn't mind</i>

678
00:33:35.704 --> 00:33:37.493
<i>I've been in love
I've been alone</i>


679
00:33:37.624 --> 00:33:41.454
<i>I've seen a million come and go
and I almost stopped trying</i>


680
00:33:42.744 --> 00:33:46.638
<i>But now that I found you
I find myself</i>


681
00:33:46.777 --> 00:33:48.980
<i>You could be the girl</i>

682
00:33:49.624 --> 00:33:51.893
<i>And you and I</i>

683
00:33:52.024 --> 00:33:54.261
<i>Could save the world</i>

684
00:34:06.425 --> 00:34:08.116
<i>In the summer of'07</i>

685

686
00:34:12.985 --> 00:34:17.622
<i>I told you mine is on my sleeve
but it's easier to see it in the dark</i>


687
00:34:19.865 --> 00:34:22.735
<i>Don't you give it up
give it up give it up</i>


688

<i>Don't you give it up give it up
give it up</i>


689
00:34:26.744 --> 00:34:29.461
<i>'Cause if you give it up
give it up give it up</i>


690
00:34:30.425 --> 00:34:33.459
<i>You've given up given up given up</i>

691

<i>On the world</i>

692
00:34:50.426 --> 00:34:52.182
Yo, Jim, what's going on, man?

693
00:34:52.986 --> 00:34:54.676
Trip's going good.
I wanna check in,


694
00:34:54.810 --> 00:34:57.298
see how everything was going
with the show last night.


695
00:34:58.585 --> 00:34:59.568
Yeah...

696
00:34:59.706 --> 00:35:01.615
Yeah, he's good, man, you're right.

697
00:35:01.946 --> 00:35:04.979
I'm with you. Think he'll be
my replacement if I decide to leave?


698
00:35:06.746 --> 00:35:10.575
No, nothing's for sure yet, man.
I mean, the interview isn't till Monday.


699
00:35:11.546 --> 00:35:13.368
Set in stone?
Claire said that? No.


700
00:35:13.498 --> 00:35:16.978
No, man, nothing's set in stone.
I might not even take the job.


701
00:35:17.946 --> 00:35:19.058
Yeah...

702
00:35:19.386 --> 00:35:20.979
All right, I just wanna check in.

703
00:35:21.465 --> 00:35:23.703
Okay, man, I'll talk to you soon.
Take it easy.


704
00:35:26.266 --> 00:35:28.208
- Look who's still here.
What happened?


705
00:35:28.346 --> 00:35:30.451
Thought you had to get back
to the city.


706
00:35:30.587 --> 00:35:32.113
- I took a look
at the train schedule.


707
00:35:32.251 --> 00:35:33.592
There was no express trains
running tonight.


708
00:35:33.723 --> 00:35:35.578
I'd have to stop at Babylon,
transfer at Jamaica,


709
00:35:35.707 --> 00:35:37.016
wait an hour.
It wasn't worth it.


710
00:35:37.146 --> 00:35:39.219
- This had nothing to do
with the fact that you ran


711
00:35:39.354 --> 00:35:41.940
into that sweet little piece of ass
down at the beach, did it?


712
00:35:42.075 --> 00:35:45.621
- No! And her name is Brooke, by the way.
- Oh, really.


713
00:35:45.755 --> 00:35:46.933
Well, guess what -

714
00:35:47.067 --> 00:35:50.296
Amy told me
that Brooke really likes you.


715
00:35:50.426 --> 00:35:53.012
And that Brooke wants you to go
to this bonfire tonight.


716
00:35:53.146 --> 00:35:55.088
And I think that's a really good idea.

717
00:35:55.226 --> 00:35:59.765
- Yeah? Then can you do me a favour
and clean the shit out of your ears?


718
00:35:59.899 --> 00:36:02.484
Because I'm engaged. It's not happening.
- Yeah, I know,


719
00:36:02.619 --> 00:36:04.920
because you keep reminding me,
but guess what -


720
00:36:05.051 --> 00:36:08.532
you are not married yet. These are
your last moments of freedom,


721
00:36:08.667 --> 00:36:11.253
and your lovely fiancÃ©e
is 3,000 miles away


722
00:36:11.387 --> 00:36:12.947
and she won't know shit.

723
00:36:13.084 --> 00:36:14.393
- What do you want me to do?

724
00:36:14.523 --> 00:36:16.410
Grab her by the hair,
drag her behind the dunes,


725
00:36:16.540 --> 00:36:18.612
fuck her brains out,
hope she doesn't say anything to Claire?


726
00:36:18.748 --> 00:36:20.788
Just pretend it doesn't happen?
Is that your game plan?


727
00:36:20.924 --> 00:36:23.477
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Because now you're talking my language.


728
00:36:23.612 --> 00:36:25.587
Now I like the way you're thinking.

729
00:36:25.724 --> 00:36:27.698
Because guess what -
it happens every night,


730
00:36:27.835 --> 00:36:30.388
in every town in every country
across the world.


731
00:36:30.524 --> 00:36:33.174
Men and women hooking up,
doing what comes naturally,


732
00:36:33.308 --> 00:36:34.649
vows be damned.

733
00:36:34.780 --> 00:36:37.879
- I don't wanna talk about this anymore.
Go ahead and enjoy your date


734
00:36:38.012 --> 00:36:40.150
with your married girlfriend, okay?
Enjoy your corrupt existence.


735
00:36:40.284 --> 00:36:42.902
I'm gonna stay here,
I'm gonna watch a little Sports Centre,


736
00:36:43.035 --> 00:36:45.785
and I'm gonna go to bed
with a clean conscience, okay?


737
00:36:45.915 --> 00:36:47.857
- Fine, I'm just
trying to help you out.

738
00:36:47.995 --> 00:36:50.233
I'm passing on advice, that's all.
- Thanks a lot.


739
00:36:51.388 --> 00:36:53.144
- Just keep something in mind,
though, okay?


740
00:36:54.908 --> 00:36:56.337
Ain't nobody videotaping ya.

741
00:36:57.948 --> 00:37:00.337
Have a good night.
- Good night, Uncle Terry.


742
00:37:35.709 --> 00:37:39.321
<i>I've come to terms
with the things that I've learned</i>


743
00:37:39.454 --> 00:37:42.749
<i>About you and your penchant
for being the person</i>


744
00:37:42.877 --> 00:37:45.146
<i>Who goes home alone</i>

745
00:37:45.789 --> 00:37:48.178
<i>And cries</i>

746
00:37:59.229 --> 00:38:01.498
<i>- Hi.
- Hey, Claire, it's me.</i>


747
00:38:01.629 --> 00:38:04.978
- Hey, I'm just having a drink
before my bridal shower. What's up?


748
00:38:07.997 --> 00:38:10.386
Hello? Earth to Johnny. 
Come in, please.

749
00:38:11.389 --> 00:38:13.777
- I don't think you're gonna like this,
but, uh...


750
00:38:14.589 --> 00:38:17.175
I don't think the job interview
is such a good idea.


751
00:38:17.310 --> 00:38:18.935
<i>- What?!
- Look, I just don't think...</i>


752
00:38:19.069 --> 00:38:22.103
<i>I should have to give up my dream.
- Hold on.</i>


753
00:38:22.238 --> 00:38:24.475
Where's all this coming from
all of a sudden?


754
00:38:24.606 --> 00:38:26.613
- You knew I never thought
it was a good idea to begin with, babe.


755
00:38:26.749 --> 00:38:29.651
- Uh, yeah. But I also know
you made me a promise.


756
00:38:29.790 --> 00:38:32.659
<i>He's pussing out on me.
- I just don't see why</i>


757
00:38:32.798 --> 00:38:35.002
I need to be making $50,000 right now.

758
00:38:35.134 --> 00:38:37.174
Between the two of us,
we're doing okay.


759
00:38:37.309 --> 00:38:39.578
- No, we are not doing okay, Johnny.

760
00:38:39.710 --> 00:38:42.710
My father pays for our rent;
that is not okay.


761
00:38:42.846 --> 00:38:44.951
<i>Besides,
I don't wanna be okay in my life.</i>


762
00:38:45.086 --> 00:38:46.712
- Why are you in such a hurry?

763
00:38:46.846 --> 00:38:49.301
Why do you wanna be
so much like your parents?


764
00:38:49.437 --> 00:38:51.030
- Because my parents
have a wonderful life


765
00:38:51.166 --> 00:38:53.686
with a big apartment
that has plenty of room for children


766
00:38:53.822 --> 00:38:56.408
and that's what I want!
And that's what you told me


767
00:38:56.542 --> 00:38:58.614
<i>you wanted as well.
- I do. I do eventually.</i>


768
00:38:58.750 --> 00:39:02.067
I just don't see why that means
I have to give up my dream.


769
00:39:02.207 --> 00:39:03.833
- Your dream? To be what?

770
00:39:03.967 --> 00:39:06.814
- To be a sportscaster, babe,
you know that. And to be honest,


771
00:39:06.943 --> 00:39:10.107
I don't think it's such a long shot.
I'm already on the radio.


772
00:39:10.239 --> 00:39:11.668
- Yeah, barely, Johnny.

773
00:39:12.671 --> 00:39:15.737
<i>Not to mention how embarrassing
this will be for my father.</i>


774
00:39:15.870 --> 00:39:18.456
<i>- He'll get over it.
- Okay, well, you know what?</i>


775
00:39:18.590 --> 00:39:21.176
You are gonna let him know
you're reneging on a promise,


776
00:39:21.311 --> 00:39:24.694
'cause I am not making that phone call.
You are making that phone call!


777
00:39:24.831 --> 00:39:27.252
In fact, no. You know what?
You're gonna do it like a man!


778
00:39:27.390 --> 00:39:29.300
<i>Face to face.
- Look...</i>


779
00:39:29.951 --> 00:39:32.090
... I haven't made my mind up.
Okay?


780
00:39:32.223 --> 00:39:34.132
Nothing's set in stone. I'm just...

781
00:39:34.270 --> 00:39:35.765
thinking out loud.

782
00:39:35.903 --> 00:39:38.172
- Well, you better make up your mind
before tomorrow night.


783
00:39:38.302 --> 00:39:42.264
Oh, cool, now I'm late for my party
and I'm in a shitty mood. Thanks a lot!


784
00:39:43.359 --> 00:39:44.504
- Babe.

785
00:40:08.991 --> 00:40:10.006
- Wow.

786
00:40:10.143 --> 00:40:13.918
Okay, please tell me
the coast is clear,


787
00:40:14.048 --> 00:40:15.990
because you look... phenomenal.

788
00:40:16.832 --> 00:40:17.944
- Thanks.

789
00:40:18.431 --> 00:40:20.319
But did you forget something?

790
00:40:22.592 --> 00:40:24.053
- No, I... don't think so.

791
00:40:24.191 --> 00:40:26.581
- You show up to a date empty-handed?

792
00:40:27.072 --> 00:40:29.341
No wine, no flowers, no chocolates.

793
00:40:29.473 --> 00:40:32.091
I mean, Terry, come on,
where's the chivalry?


794
00:40:32.224 --> 00:40:34.842
- I'm kinda shocked that I forgot,

795
00:40:34.977 --> 00:40:37.660
because I have something...
pretty special.


796
00:40:37.792 --> 00:40:39.254
It's just in the car.

797
00:40:39.392 --> 00:40:40.952
Give me one second.
I'll be right back.


798
00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:46.749
- Should I be scared or excited?

799
00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:49.302
- No, I think you're...
really gonna like this. It's...


800
00:40:57.313 --> 00:41:00.957
Granted, it's a little unorthodox, okay?
But I have a friend


801
00:41:01.088 --> 00:41:02.943
who owns this little boutique
downtown,


802
00:41:03.073 --> 00:41:06.488
and he swears to me
this is a pretty hot commodity.


803
00:41:06.624 --> 00:41:09.789
So... take a look,
tell me if you like it.


804
00:41:09.921 --> 00:41:12.092
- Wow! Very impressive.

805
00:41:12.226 --> 00:41:14.298
- A little better
than a bottle of Cabernet, right?


806
00:41:14.433 --> 00:41:16.702
Yes, a little better!

807
00:41:16.833 --> 00:41:18.426
Please, come in.

808
00:41:19.713 --> 00:41:21.501
<i>Oh my darling
- How are ya?</i>


809
00:41:21.633 --> 00:41:23.837
<i>Love to call you mine</i>

810
00:41:23.969 --> 00:41:25.049
<i>Oh my darling</i>

811
00:41:25.185 --> 00:41:29.757
<i>Now that you've arrived
there's so much I'd like to show you</i>


812
00:41:29.889 --> 00:41:31.416
<i>Gonna know you
- Hey.</i>


813
00:41:31.553 --> 00:41:34.455
<i>For the rest of my life
- Hey. I knew you'd show up.</i>


814
00:41:34.593 --> 00:41:36.982
- How ya doin? Ah...
What's going on?


815
00:41:38.753 --> 00:41:41.306
Friends of yours?
- Ah, they just met.


816
00:41:44.193 --> 00:41:45.622
- So... how you doin'?

817
00:41:45.953 --> 00:41:48.320
- I'm doing great,
but not as well as Maggie over there.


818
00:41:49.473 --> 00:41:52.889
Jesus, Mags, get a room!
- Were you guys watching us?


819
00:41:53.026 --> 00:41:55.033
- Kinda hard not to.

820
00:41:55.170 --> 00:41:57.953
- Sorry. I thought everybody had left.
- No...


821
00:41:58.434 --> 00:42:00.856
Still here. Just watching the show.

822
00:42:02.434 --> 00:42:05.118
Hey, this is my friend Johnny
I was telling you about.


823
00:42:05.250 --> 00:42:06.428
- Hi.
- Hi, Johnny.


824
00:42:06.562 --> 00:42:09.911
You're the DJ, right?
- Uh, yeah. I do like a talk-radio show.


825
00:42:10.050 --> 00:42:12.025
- All right, babe, I'm outta here.
- Oh.


826
00:42:12.162 --> 00:42:15.675
Sorry. I'm gonna go. Are you cool?
- Yeah. I'm with Johnny.


827
00:42:15.810 --> 00:42:18.745
Who is much more well-endowed
than that dude!


828
00:42:18.882 --> 00:42:20.408
- Whip it out right here.
- Yeah!


829
00:42:20.546 --> 00:42:22.912
Come on, bro! Whip it out!

830
00:42:28.194 --> 00:42:30.779
- So the party kind of broke up
a little early, huh?


831
00:42:30.914 --> 00:42:32.986
- I dunno.
Depends on how you look at it.


832
00:42:33.634 --> 00:42:36.352
Maybe now that you're here,
the party just got started.


833
00:42:37.155 --> 00:42:38.649
Oh, shit!
- You okay?


834
00:42:38.786 --> 00:42:40.958
- Yeah. Maggie!

835
00:42:41.091 --> 00:42:42.585
Hey, Maggie!

836
00:42:44.994 --> 00:42:46.423
You got my keys!

837
00:42:47.555 --> 00:42:48.831
Leave them on the mat.

838
00:42:51.714 --> 00:42:53.951
- Oh, careful.

839
00:42:58.275 --> 00:43:00.512
That was a close one, huh?

840
00:43:13.475 --> 00:43:15.068
- Can I tell you something?

841
00:43:15.874 --> 00:43:17.303
- Yeah. What's up?

842
00:43:17.442 --> 00:43:20.029
- It's really more like a confession.

843
00:43:20.675 --> 00:43:22.498
Does that make you nervous?

844
00:43:22.628 --> 00:43:25.497
- Nervous? No. Doesn't make me nervous.
Do I look nervous?


845
00:43:25.635 --> 00:43:27.391
- You kinda look nervous.
- I'm not nervous.


846
00:43:27.524 --> 00:43:30.590
No. There's just some smoke
blowing in my eyes a little bit.


847
00:43:34.756 --> 00:43:35.868
- I...

848
00:43:36.676 --> 00:43:38.269
... have never been in love.

849
00:43:39.715 --> 00:43:41.144
Is that weird?

850
00:43:41.955 --> 00:43:43.548
- No, I don't think that's weird.

851
00:43:44.708 --> 00:43:46.780
- I was close. 
I was really close.

852
00:43:46.916 --> 00:43:49.818
With that jerk I was telling you about.
- Mm.


853
00:43:49.956 --> 00:43:51.549
- He was so romantic.

854
00:43:52.355 --> 00:43:53.948
Get this. He told me...

855
00:43:54.756 --> 00:43:58.138
... that I was the queen
of all his dreams.


856
00:43:58.275 --> 00:44:00.064
Can you believe I bought that?

857
00:44:00.195 --> 00:44:03.066
- Yeah... and he stole that
from a Led Zeppelin song.


858
00:44:04.517 --> 00:44:05.629
Sorry.

859
00:44:08.197 --> 00:44:09.658
- She really loves you?

860
00:44:09.796 --> 00:44:11.706
- I hope so, we're getting married soon.

861
00:44:15.556 --> 00:44:17.345
- Man, if she really loves you,

862
00:44:17.476 --> 00:44:20.476
why is she making you take
that stupid-ass cardboard job


863
00:44:20.612 --> 00:44:23.100
when even I can
tell you don't want it?

864
00:44:23.236 --> 00:44:26.433
- You know, I've been struggling
with that question all weekend.


865
00:44:26.916 --> 00:44:28.989
But you'd be happy to know that...

866
00:44:29.636 --> 00:44:31.545
... I called her
and I let her know

867
00:44:31.684 --> 00:44:33.659
that I'm thinking
about not taking the job.


868
00:44:33.796 --> 00:44:36.830
- Hey! Good for you!
- Thank you. Thanks.


869
00:44:46.758 --> 00:44:48.514
No, no, no. No, this is...

870
00:44:49.157 --> 00:44:50.586
This isn't a good idea.

871
00:44:51.717 --> 00:44:53.953
- Yeah, but what
if it was just, um...

872
00:44:55.237 --> 00:44:56.699
... a sweet...

873
00:44:56.837 --> 00:44:58.593
little, innocent kiss?

874
00:44:59.717 --> 00:45:01.659
- You're drunk.
- I know.


875
00:45:02.597 --> 00:45:04.353
And I'm stoned, too.

876
00:45:04.837 --> 00:45:06.266
- She's stoned, too.

877
00:45:12.037 --> 00:45:13.346
Mm. Mm-mm.

878
00:45:13.477 --> 00:45:15.866
Mm-mm. No, no, no, no, no, no.

879
00:45:16.005 --> 00:45:18.427
This is bad.
Look, Brooke, I like you.


880
00:45:19.397 --> 00:45:21.667
You're so pretty and I would want
nothing more than to...


881
00:45:21.797 --> 00:45:24.383
kiss you... right now,
but I'm engaged.


882
00:45:24.517 --> 00:45:25.946
I can't do this.

883
00:45:26.277 --> 00:45:27.936
I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go.

884
00:45:28.070 --> 00:45:30.787
- What, and leave me here all alone?

885
00:45:30.918 --> 00:45:32.445
- Where are all your friends?

886
00:45:34.598 --> 00:45:36.027
- Everybody's gone.

887
00:45:36.998 --> 00:45:38.754
Everybody except you.

888
00:45:40.838 --> 00:45:44.034
- How are you gonna get home?
- I could sleep on the beach.


889
00:45:44.518 --> 00:45:46.241
Have you ever slept on the beach?

890
00:45:46.374 --> 00:45:48.676
- Not really
a sleep-on-the-beach kinda guy.


891
00:45:51.238 --> 00:45:52.667
- You could be.

892
00:45:53.158 --> 00:45:55.841
- Look, how about I drive you home
in your car, okay?


893
00:45:55.974 --> 00:45:59.455
Then I'd drop you off and return it
in the morning. Is that okay?


894
00:45:59.590 --> 00:46:01.150
- You would do that?

895
00:46:01.830 --> 00:46:03.074
- Yeah, of course.

896
00:46:03.878 --> 00:46:05.219
- Hey, Johnny?

897
00:46:05.637 --> 00:46:06.750
- Yeah?

898
00:46:08.838 --> 00:46:10.431
- You really are a nice guy.

899
00:46:10.791 --> 00:46:13.060
- I try. Let's go.

900
00:46:13.191 --> 00:46:15.874
Come on, huh?
- Hey, I'm cold.


901
00:46:16.679 --> 00:46:17.627
- Here.

902
00:46:24.838 --> 00:46:27.075
Let's go. Let's get you home, huh?

903
00:46:28.039 --> 00:46:29.468
Careful...

904
00:46:29.607 --> 00:46:32.389
Somehow I don't really know.

905
00:46:32.518 --> 00:46:34.493
No, it's okay, let it go. It's fine.

906
00:46:34.631 --> 00:46:36.387
We're gonna pick it up in a second.

907
00:46:36.519 --> 00:46:39.268
Let's get you to the car, huh?
- All right, that sounds good.


908
00:46:40.679 --> 00:46:43.428
Do you wanna sing a song with me?
- Maybe later, huh?


909
00:46:43.559 --> 00:46:46.276
- Maybe in the car?
- Yeah, yeah. We'll sing one right now.


910
00:46:46.407 --> 00:46:48.709
We'll sing a song. Okay, watch yourself.
- Okay, okay.


911
00:46:48.838 --> 00:46:49.983
- Big step!
- Oh...


912
00:46:50.119 --> 00:46:51.067
- Oh...!

913
00:46:51.559 --> 00:46:52.988
Okay, hang out right here.

914
00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:55.236
There we go.

915
00:46:56.679 --> 00:46:57.792
Okay...

916
00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:04.996
Your chariot.
- Who says chivalry is dead?


917
00:47:05.800 --> 00:47:08.353
- Okay, okay... Okay.

918
00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:12.829
There we go.

919
00:47:13.799 --> 00:47:16.549
One foot... two foot. Perfect.

920
00:47:16.679 --> 00:47:18.719
Be right back.
I'm gonna grab the rest.


921
00:47:18.855 --> 00:47:21.506
- Yeah, I'm just gonna
close my eyes for a second.


922
00:47:21.639 --> 00:47:23.068
- All right, I'll be right back.

923
00:47:28.199 --> 00:47:31.548
Okay... This is everything you had,
right? This is all your stuff?


924
00:47:35.879 --> 00:47:36.828
Brooke.

925
00:47:38.601 --> 00:47:39.877
Hey, Brooke.

926
00:47:41.321 --> 00:47:44.135
Brooke! I don't know where you live!
I don't know where to take you.


927
00:47:46.921 --> 00:47:48.349
Perfect.

928
00:47:55.848 --> 00:47:57.223
Shit.

929
00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:14.014
- Where are we?
- My uncle's place.


930
00:48:14.152 --> 00:48:17.022
You passed out,
so I didn't know where to take you.


931
00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:20.357
I can still take you home, though.
- No, no, no, it'll be fine.


932
00:48:28.681 --> 00:48:31.714
- So look...
I'm gonna take you to my room.


933
00:48:32.362 --> 00:48:33.791
Okay, you can stay there?

934
00:48:35.561 --> 00:48:37.154
- Um... okay.

935
00:48:37.801 --> 00:48:39.711
- No, I'll stay on the couch.

936
00:48:40.361 --> 00:48:41.473
- Got it.

937
00:48:42.121 --> 00:48:43.233
- All right.

938
00:49:15.722 --> 00:49:17.151
<i>Why...</i>

939
00:49:18.762 --> 00:49:21.664
<i>Do I apologize</i>

940
00:49:21.802 --> 00:49:25.184
<i>For everything
from what I say to what I sing</i>


941
00:49:25.322 --> 00:49:27.231
<i>And why...
Good night.</i>


942
00:49:28.842 --> 00:49:30.850
<i>Have all my friends</i>

943
00:49:30.986 --> 00:49:32.546
<i>Become my enemies</i>

944
00:49:32.682 --> 00:49:35.911
<i>Do they see some other side of me</i>

945
00:49:36.042 --> 00:49:38.911
<i>Do you say you've got one too</i>

946
00:49:39.882 --> 00:49:42.631
<i>Perhaps I can relate to you</i>

947
00:49:42.762 --> 00:49:46.111
<i>And everything you're going through</i>

948
00:49:56.683 --> 00:49:59.171
- I think you should call him back
and apologize.


949
00:49:59.307 --> 00:50:01.795
- No, I'm not gonna call him back
and apologize.


950
00:50:01.931 --> 00:50:05.509
- Dude, you called him a pussy.
- I did not call him a pussy!


951
00:50:05.642 --> 00:50:07.846
- I was standing right there!
You totally said,


952
00:50:07.979 --> 00:50:10.313
''I knew you would puss out.''
- Oh...


953
00:50:10.442 --> 00:50:12.864
Well, I said that to you, not him.

954
00:50:13.003 --> 00:50:15.720
- I know. Listen,
I think you should call him back,


955
00:50:15.850 --> 00:50:18.818
'cause it's like, what,

956
00:50:18.955 --> 00:50:20.842
So you're gonna
get his voicemail anyhow.


957
00:50:20.971 --> 00:50:23.240
And just leave him
a nice, nice message.


958
00:50:24.363 --> 00:50:25.792
Tell him that you understand

959
00:50:25.931 --> 00:50:29.160
why he's having such a hard time
going on this interview.


960
00:50:29.290 --> 00:50:31.430
That he still has to go anyway,

961
00:50:31.563 --> 00:50:33.800
yadda, yadda, yadda...
I think you should do that.


962
00:50:35.403 --> 00:50:38.120
- All right, fine, I will call him.
But... it really pisses me off


963
00:50:38.252 --> 00:50:40.586
that I'm being made to look
like the bad guy here.


964
00:50:40.715 --> 00:50:42.439
- You're not the bad guy.
- I know.


965
00:50:44.684 --> 00:50:45.796
Ahem.

966
00:51:05.484 --> 00:51:06.629
- Hello?

967
00:51:15.372 --> 00:51:16.834
- What just happened?

968
00:51:19.564 --> 00:51:21.026
- That sonofabitch!
Some girl just answered!


969
00:51:21.165 --> 00:51:22.888
- Did you dial the right number?
- Yes!


970
00:51:23.021 --> 00:51:26.250
I have it programmed, for chrissake!
- Make sure you called the right person!


971
00:51:26.381 --> 00:51:29.610
- Oh my God, I do not fucking believe
this! If this fucking guy


972
00:51:29.740 --> 00:51:32.708
is fucking around on me,
I swear I'm gonna call Kevin Tyler,


973
00:51:32.845 --> 00:51:35.562
that hot guy from the office,
have him come over here,


974
00:51:35.692 --> 00:51:38.921
clear these bags from this table
and make sweet, vengeful love to him


975
00:51:39.053 --> 00:51:41.442
on top of this thing
Johnny's mom bought me!


976
00:51:41.581 --> 00:51:44.036
Give me one moment.

977
00:51:52.045 --> 00:51:53.125
- Hello?

978
00:51:53.261 --> 00:51:57.223
<i>- Who is this, please?
- This is Brooke. Who is this, please?</i>


979
00:51:57.358 --> 00:52:00.205
- This is Claire Meadows.
Would you mind explaining to me


980
00:52:00.334 --> 00:52:02.887
how the hell you are answering
this fucking phone


981
00:52:03.021 --> 00:52:04.843
at 3:00 in the morning?!

982
00:52:04.974 --> 00:52:07.275
- Wow, lady, chill out.

983
00:52:07.406 --> 00:52:09.194
You are rude...

984
00:52:09.326 --> 00:52:10.438
Goodbye.

985
00:52:14.445 --> 00:52:17.063
- She hung up on me.
She hung up on me, that bitch!


986
00:52:17.197 --> 00:52:20.361
- What'd she say?
- Nothing. Said I was rude and hung up.


987
00:52:20.494 --> 00:52:22.316
- You're not rude! 
You're the nicest!

988
00:52:22.445 --> 00:52:25.445
- I'm rude? I'm not the one
who's answering someone else's...


989
00:52:25.581 --> 00:52:28.364
fucking fiancÃ©'s phone
in the middle of the night!


990
00:52:29.645 --> 00:52:31.270
Holy shit...

991
00:52:31.406 --> 00:52:32.747
I'm gonna cry.

992
00:52:32.878 --> 00:52:35.725
- No, no, no.
- Holy shit, holy shit, I'm gonna cry!


993
00:52:35.854 --> 00:52:38.407
- No, no, no, no. No.
Hey, hey, hey. No.


994
00:52:38.541 --> 00:52:40.876
Pretty, pretty, pretty...
Don't jump to conclusions, okay?


995
00:52:41.007 --> 00:52:42.468
He's with his uncle, right?

996
00:52:42.606 --> 00:52:45.323
So that could be some girl
that's hooking up with his uncle.


997
00:52:45.966 --> 00:52:47.395
- No, that's stupid.

998
00:52:49.326 --> 00:52:53.068
Fuck it, I'm calling Kevin Tyler.
- No! Just... call that bitch back.


999
00:52:53.198 --> 00:52:56.678
Tell her she better get
your fucking fiancÃ© on the phone.


1000
00:52:58.287 --> 00:52:59.399
Do that.

1001
00:53:01.518 --> 00:53:04.039
What the... fuck?

1002
00:53:10.926 --> 00:53:13.315
- She's not even picking up.
It's going straight to voicemail.


1003
00:53:14.126 --> 00:53:15.238
Ahem.

1004
00:53:17.006 --> 00:53:19.242
Hi, baby, it's your fiancÃ©e!

1005
00:53:19.886 --> 00:53:24.229
So why is it that you didn't wanna
go for that job interview?


1006
00:53:24.367 --> 00:53:28.044
Is it because you're too busy
sticking your little pencil dick


1007
00:53:28.175 --> 00:53:30.150
into some Long Island bitch's ass?!

1008
00:53:30.287 --> 00:53:32.938
Seriously, Johnny,
you better have a good explanation


1009
00:53:33.071 --> 00:53:35.722
for why there's some whore
answering your phone


1010
00:53:35.855 --> 00:53:38.310
at 3:00 in the morning, Johnny!

1011
00:53:38.447 --> 00:53:40.552
Listen, I never wanna see you again!

1012
00:53:40.687 --> 00:53:43.305
You are a piece of shit, Johnny Rizzo,

1013
00:53:43.439 --> 00:53:46.122
and I hope your fucking cock falls off!

1014
00:53:47.407 --> 00:53:51.433
- Okay, so that was a little bit harsher
than I think we intended, but...


1015
00:53:51.567 --> 00:53:52.876
hey...

1016
00:53:53.007 --> 00:53:54.469
hey, it's Johnny.

1017
00:53:54.607 --> 00:53:56.036
He probably just lost his phone.

1018
00:54:03.887 --> 00:54:06.277
- Who the bloody hell is that?

1019
00:54:16.848 --> 00:54:18.124
Excuse me.

1020
00:54:19.087 --> 00:54:20.200
Excuse me!

1021
00:54:21.007 --> 00:54:22.600
Hello? What are you doing here?

1022
00:54:23.728 --> 00:54:25.768
What are you doing here?
Open the door.


1023
00:54:25.904 --> 00:54:27.944
- My uncle lives here. Who are you?

1024
00:54:28.080 --> 00:54:30.982
- I am the caretaker of this property
and you're trespassing. Now who are you?


1025
00:54:31.119 --> 00:54:33.007
- I'm not trespassing.
This is my uncle's house.


1026
00:54:33.135 --> 00:54:35.307
- What uncle? I don't know any uncle.

1027
00:54:35.440 --> 00:54:38.287
- Terry Cunningham.
- Terry Cunningham


1028
00:54:38.416 --> 00:54:40.717
doesn't own this house!
He's a guest of Mrs. Giordano,


1029
00:54:40.848 --> 00:54:43.881
and he's meant to be out of here
by 8:00 this morning!


1030
00:54:44.016 --> 00:54:45.674
So I want you to pack your bags,

1031
00:54:45.808 --> 00:54:47.499
and get up and go and leave.

1032
00:54:47.632 --> 00:54:49.389
Or otherwise. I'll... 
I'll call the cops.

1033
00:54:49.521 --> 00:54:52.237
- Wait, what?
This isn't my uncle's house?


1034
00:54:52.369 --> 00:54:54.824
- I'm giving you five minutes.
Five minutes to pack up your shit


1035
00:54:54.961 --> 00:54:57.066
and get out of here.
I mean it, get out!


1036
00:54:57.200 --> 00:54:58.411
Now! Go!

1037
00:54:58.545 --> 00:55:00.072
- Out!
- Okay!


1038
00:55:00.209 --> 00:55:01.419
- Five minutes.

1039
00:55:14.449 --> 00:55:15.463
- Brooke...

1040
00:55:18.129 --> 00:55:19.339
Brooke.

1041
00:55:20.369 --> 00:55:23.402
We gotta get going. I'm sorry.
You gotta get up.


1042
00:55:25.169 --> 00:55:26.445
- Oh, hey.

1043
00:55:28.689 --> 00:55:30.118
Where am I again?

1044
00:55:30.736 --> 00:55:32.624
- I'm not sure, actually,
whose house this is, anymore,


1045
00:55:32.754 --> 00:55:35.536
but this is where I'm staying
and I had to take you here.


1046
00:55:35.666 --> 00:55:38.448
I was gonna drive you home last night.
- You took me home?


1047
00:55:39.410 --> 00:55:41.003
Wait, did anything happen?

1048
00:55:44.529 --> 00:55:46.634
- No. No.
- Oh, good.


1049
00:55:46.769 --> 00:55:47.751
- Yeah.

1050
00:55:47.889 --> 00:55:50.606
- Well, not that that would've been bad,
necessarily...


1051
00:55:50.738 --> 00:55:53.193
- Yeah, you were really drunk last night.
- Yeah, I got pretty wasted.


1052
00:55:53.329 --> 00:55:55.784
- You passed out, actually.
So I didn't know where to take you,


1053
00:55:55.921 --> 00:55:57.677
so I took you here.
Hope it's okay.


1054
00:55:57.810 --> 00:56:01.006
- And nothing happened?
- No, nothing happened.


1055
00:56:01.650 --> 00:56:03.886
- Not even a... kiss?

1056
00:56:05.490 --> 00:56:06.799
- Kiss? Uh...

1057
00:56:06.929 --> 00:56:08.456
there might've been a...

1058
00:56:08.593 --> 00:56:10.960
... a small, innocent kiss of sorts.

1059
00:56:11.090 --> 00:56:12.399
No big deal.

1060
00:56:12.529 --> 00:56:14.984
- Oh... the innocent kiss.
- Yeah.


1061
00:56:15.122 --> 00:56:16.649
- I remember that.

1062
00:56:16.786 --> 00:56:18.696
- Look, actually. Can we, um...
can we get going?


1063
00:56:18.835 --> 00:56:20.973
There's a guy downstairs,
he say's he'll call the cops


1064
00:56:21.107 --> 00:56:22.481
if we don't leave.
- The cops?


1065
00:56:22.610 --> 00:56:25.578
Why?
I thought you said nothing happened.


1066
00:56:25.714 --> 00:56:26.729
- Yeah. Nothing did happen.

1067
00:56:26.867 --> 00:56:28.623
But we gotta get going.
I can't find my phone,


1068
00:56:28.754 --> 00:56:31.121
so I can't call my uncle,
so I don't know what's going on.


1069
00:56:31.250 --> 00:56:35.790
- Y'know, I have a vague recollection
of it ringing in the middle of the night


1070
00:56:35.922 --> 00:56:38.093
and me throwing it across the room.

1071
00:56:38.226 --> 00:56:40.114
- That's right, you had my sweatshirt.

1072
00:56:42.546 --> 00:56:45.132
- Is that it over there?
- Let me see.


1073
00:56:46.930 --> 00:56:48.042
Shoot.

1074
00:56:49.010 --> 00:56:50.668
Yeah, okay. Uh...

1075
00:56:50.802 --> 00:56:52.810
my fiancÃ©e called.
All right, I'm gonna go downstairs


1076
00:56:52.946 --> 00:56:54.953
and listen to the voicemail.
Can you get ready?


1077
00:56:55.090 --> 00:56:56.716
I'll meet you down there?
- Yeah, okay.


1078
00:56:56.850 --> 00:56:58.444
- All right. Great.
- Hey, um...


1079
00:56:58.579 --> 00:57:01.001
Thanks for... taking care of me.

1080
00:57:02.099 --> 00:57:03.593
- Of course.

1081
00:57:03.731 --> 00:57:04.844
All right.

1082
00:57:15.667 --> 00:57:19.279
<i>It was a Saturday
spent sitting on the lawn</i>


1083
00:57:19.411 --> 00:57:20.906
<i>The radio was on</i>

1084
00:57:21.491 --> 00:57:24.240
<i>Soundtrack to the time
I spent with you</i>


1085
00:57:24.371 --> 00:57:26.672
<i>So I listened all night long</i>

1086
00:57:28.051 --> 00:57:29.993
<i>Every number put me somewhere</i>

1087
00:57:30.131 --> 00:57:32.400
<i>From 1988 to '91</i>

1088
00:57:32.531 --> 00:57:34.898
<i>We all need the music</i>

1089
00:57:36.467 --> 00:57:39.249
<i>We all love a song</i>

1090
00:57:40.371 --> 00:57:44.333
<i>In our hearts it saves us</i>

1091
00:57:44.468 --> 00:57:46.770
<i>It saves us when we're out of whack</i>

1092
00:57:46.900 --> 00:57:48.111
<i>So ain't it time</i>

1093
00:57:48.244 --> 00:57:50.219
<i>We saved the music back</i>

1094
00:57:58.004 --> 00:57:58.579
You didn't happen to pick up
my cellphone last night?


1095
00:57:58.579 --> 00:58:00.402
You didn't happen to pick up
my cellphone last night?


1096
00:58:00.532 --> 00:58:01.645
- Oh...

1097
00:58:02.292 --> 00:58:03.721
You know, I may have.

1098
00:58:04.052 --> 00:58:06.637
Is that a problem?
- Yeah. Yeah.


1099
00:58:06.772 --> 00:58:10.481
- I kinda remember some lady
screaming at me. What was that?


1100
00:58:10.612 --> 00:58:12.684
- Yeah, that lady was my fiancÃ©e.

1101
00:58:12.820 --> 00:58:16.398
She left a pretty nasty voicemail
asking why some girl -


1102
00:58:16.532 --> 00:58:18.670
I'm assuming that's you -
picked up my phone


1103
00:58:18.804 --> 00:58:21.007
at 3:00 in the morning.
- Oh, shit.


1104
00:58:21.971 --> 00:58:23.913
Is it bad?
- Yeah, kinda!


1105
00:58:24.051 --> 00:58:26.955
She said something
about wanting my dick to fall off?


1106
00:58:27.093 --> 00:58:31.086
- Wow, that would not be good.
- No! No! I think she'd do it, too.


1107
00:58:31.220 --> 00:58:34.635
She'd rip it off!
- Tough to roll as a eunuch these days,


1108
00:58:34.773 --> 00:58:36.299
I would think.
- Yeah. Thanks.


1109
00:58:36.853 --> 00:58:38.347
- Do me a favour?
- Yeah.


1110
00:58:38.485 --> 00:58:40.590
- Grab the wheel a second?
- Right now?


1111
00:58:40.724 --> 00:58:42.928
- Yeah, it's cool, just steer.
- All right.


1112
00:58:43.573 --> 00:58:45.002
- Good?
- Yeah, right.


1113
00:58:45.141 --> 00:58:47.596
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, yeah.


1114
00:58:47.733 --> 00:58:49.522
- You doing good.

1115
00:58:49.653 --> 00:58:52.336
Ah, yeah, this is relaxing.
- Oh, that's funny!


1116
00:58:52.469 --> 00:58:54.541
That's funny. All right, here.

1117
00:59:01.013 --> 00:59:02.606
<i>Gonna save it back</i>

1118
00:59:03.093 --> 00:59:04.719
<i>Ah save it back</i>

1119
00:59:04.853 --> 00:59:06.762
<i>Save the music back</i>

1120
00:59:13.654 --> 00:59:14.963
All set?
- Yeah.


1121
00:59:15.093 --> 00:59:17.908
Wow, you must be hungry.
Is that a whole pie?


1122
00:59:18.038 --> 00:59:20.078
- Yeah, it's for the mother-in-law.

1123
00:59:20.214 --> 00:59:21.490
- Excuse me?

1124
00:59:21.974 --> 00:59:23.435
- It's for the mother-in-law.

1125
00:59:23.573 --> 00:59:25.461
- Sorry, I'm not hearing you.
- That's funny.


1126
00:59:25.589 --> 00:59:28.044
It's for the mother-in-law.
Is that better?


1127
00:59:28.694 --> 00:59:30.122
Got it. Got it.
- Whoa.


1128
00:59:32.694 --> 00:59:35.083
You know you're not married yet.
- Thanks.


1129
00:59:41.494 --> 00:59:44.211
<i>Don't ask about the other night</i>

1130
00:59:44.853 --> 00:59:47.122
<i>I was drunk and tired</i>

1131
00:59:47.254 --> 00:59:49.359
<i>Just take a minute</i>

1132
00:59:49.493 --> 00:59:50.956
<i>Unwind</i>

1133
00:59:51.095 --> 00:59:53.004
<i>Let the sleeping dog lie</i>

1134
00:59:54.454 --> 00:59:55.883
<i>Lie...</i>

1135
01:00:00.535 --> 01:00:03.469
- Hey, listen,
you should just let me talk to her.


1136
01:00:03.606 --> 01:00:05.362
I'll tell her what really happened.

1137
01:00:05.495 --> 01:00:07.884
I feel bad. I feel a little responsible.

1138
01:00:09.494 --> 01:00:12.177
I'd feel better if I knew everything
was gonna be okay with you two.


1139
01:00:12.311 --> 01:00:14.831
- Well, thank you, but I think

1140
01:00:14.966 --> 01:00:18.414
that is a very, very bad idea.
- Why?


1141
01:00:18.550 --> 01:00:20.557
I'll just tell her
what a gentleman you've been.


1142
01:00:20.694 --> 01:00:23.629
- Yeah, but even if you told her
what happened and she believed you -


1143
01:00:23.766 --> 01:00:26.003
which she won't, by the way -
she's still gonna wonder


1144
01:00:26.134 --> 01:00:28.141
why we're having breakfast
first thing in the morning.


1145
01:00:28.279 --> 01:00:30.482
It... it's not worth it. 
I can handle it.

1146
01:00:30.614 --> 01:00:32.654
- You can tell her
you made a new friend.


1147
01:00:32.790 --> 01:00:36.533
- I don't think she'd like the idea of me
having a friend that looks like you.


1148
01:00:39.415 --> 01:00:42.644
- Then you better definitely not tell her
what a good time we're having.


1149
01:00:42.775 --> 01:00:46.004
- Good time?
No, there's no time for fun.


1150
01:00:46.135 --> 01:00:49.004
It's only: ''Hurry up, Johnny,
it's time to get a job!


1151
01:00:49.143 --> 01:00:50.704
It's time to make some real money!

1152
01:00:50.839 --> 01:00:52.879
Come on, Johnny,
it's time for a real career!


1153
01:00:53.015 --> 01:00:56.048
Stop being a kid! Grow up!
You're almost 25, for fuck's sake!''


1154
01:01:01.015 --> 01:01:02.030
- Wow.

1155
01:01:03.575 --> 01:01:05.964
Sounds like you really needed
to get that off your chest.


1156
01:01:09.335 --> 01:01:11.724
Dude, you should just call her right now.

1157
01:01:13.335 --> 01:01:15.724
- And say what?
- I don't know, man.


1158
01:01:15.863 --> 01:01:17.969
Just... tell her how you feel.

1159
01:01:18.104 --> 01:01:19.566
- Feel about what?

1160
01:01:28.216 --> 01:01:29.677
Is that her?

1161
01:01:29.816 --> 01:01:31.921
I bet you it's her.
That would be so weird.


1162
01:01:32.056 --> 01:01:33.965
- No. No, it's my uncle.

1163
01:01:34.456 --> 01:01:35.885
I'll be right back.

1164
01:01:37.496 --> 01:01:39.569
<i>Hey, Uncle Terry, what's going on?
- I'm at the house,</i>


1165
01:01:39.704 --> 01:01:41.940
just grabbing my shit.
Where are you?


1166
01:01:42.072 --> 01:01:44.210
- I'm at the beach, actually.
With Brooke.


1167
01:01:45.432 --> 01:01:47.090
- Oh, really? Really?

1168
01:01:47.896 --> 01:01:51.857
So I guess our little talk last night
did you some good after all. Huh?


1169
01:01:51.992 --> 01:01:54.447
Was it as mind-blowing
as you imagined?


1170
01:01:54.584 --> 01:01:57.268
- No, it's not like that.
She had too much to drink last night,


1171
01:01:57.400 --> 01:01:59.855
so I took her back to your place.
Which, by the way,


1172
01:01:59.992 --> 01:02:01.935
I found out isn't actually your place,
is it?


1173
01:02:02.072 --> 01:02:04.178
<i>- Really? What makes you say that?
- Some English guy came,</i>


1174
01:02:04.313 --> 01:02:07.858
woke us up, said if we weren't out
by 8:00, he'd call the cops.


1175
01:02:07.993 --> 01:02:09.935
<i>So what's the deal?
Is it your place or not?</i>


1176
01:02:10.073 --> 01:02:12.277
- Did I actually ever say that?
I don't think I did.


1177
01:02:12.409 --> 01:02:14.613
<i>- Yeah, you said,
''Mi casa es su casa.''</i>


1178
01:02:14.745 --> 01:02:17.112
- Seriously, how the hell
could I afford a house this nice?


1179
01:02:17.241 --> 01:02:20.339
Look, I will pick you up
in the parking lot in about 10 minutes.


1180
01:02:20.473 --> 01:02:22.611
- All right, cool. 
I'll see you in a bit.

1181
01:02:24.856 --> 01:02:26.285
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, everything's fine.


1182
01:02:26.424 --> 01:02:29.359
My Uncle Terry's gonna pick me up
in a bit.


1183
01:02:29.497 --> 01:02:30.774
- Oh, really?

1184
01:02:31.736 --> 01:02:33.165
So this is it?

1185
01:02:34.297 --> 01:02:35.759
This is the...

1186
01:02:35.897 --> 01:02:37.806
end of our summer fling?

1187
01:02:38.937 --> 01:02:40.213
- Guess so.

1188
01:02:41.529 --> 01:02:43.799
You wanna go swimming?

1189
01:02:46.298 --> 01:02:49.810
- Looks kinda rough, don't you think?
I'm not the strongest swimmer.


1190
01:02:50.298 --> 01:02:53.331
- Come on, you got to dive in
at least once before you go.


1191
01:02:53.465 --> 01:02:55.407
- It's gonna be cold! No!

1192
01:02:56.058 --> 01:02:58.392
- It'll be good for my hangover!

1193
01:03:00.697 --> 01:03:03.250
- If it'll be good for your hangover,
all right.


1194
01:03:13.177 --> 01:03:14.421
- Wow.

1195
01:03:14.554 --> 01:03:17.685
Those waves look a little bigger...
bigger than I thought!


1196
01:03:17.817 --> 01:03:20.403
- I told you.
I said they looked rough.

1197
01:03:20.537 --> 01:03:22.839
- All right, are you thinking
what I'm thinking?


1198
01:03:22.969 --> 01:03:25.009
Depends on what you're thinking.

1199
01:03:25.978 --> 01:03:27.921
- I'm thinking maybe, um...

1200
01:03:28.059 --> 01:03:29.520
let's go back.
- Yeah.


1201
01:03:29.658 --> 01:03:31.087
- Okay.
- Yeah, okay.


1202
01:03:37.499 --> 01:03:38.960
So, uh...

1203
01:03:39.098 --> 01:03:41.335
you know what you're gonna do
after the summer?


1204
01:03:42.299 --> 01:03:44.437
- I hadn't really thought that far ahead.

1205
01:03:44.571 --> 01:03:47.418
You got any ideas?
- Uh, you can go pro?


1206
01:03:48.858 --> 01:03:50.582
- Oh, I think that dream is dead.

1207
01:03:50.714 --> 01:03:53.681
But you know
what I always wanted to do?


1208
01:03:53.819 --> 01:03:55.858
- What's that?
- Cross-country road trip.


1209
01:03:55.995 --> 01:03:59.224
Maybe... find my way out to Oakland.

1210
01:04:03.579 --> 01:04:06.928
You should give me your phone
and let me put my number in it.


1211
01:04:07.067 --> 01:04:09.685
That way, just in case
you don't take this new job,


1212
01:04:09.818 --> 01:04:13.496
and you go back to your radio gig
and you still want to interview me,


1213
01:04:13.627 --> 01:04:15.122
you'll know how to get in touch.

1214
01:04:15.259 --> 01:04:16.371
- Yeah...

1215
01:04:17.980 --> 01:04:19.409
I don't think so, Brooke.

1216
01:04:19.739 --> 01:04:21.812
Yeah, I had fun this weekend.
I did, really.


1217
01:04:21.947 --> 01:04:24.565
I just...
don't think that's such a good idea.


1218
01:04:24.700 --> 01:04:26.642
You know, I feel like it's...

1219
01:04:26.779 --> 01:04:28.055
a little...

1220
01:04:29.819 --> 01:04:32.121
- Inappropriate?
- Yes.


1221
01:04:32.251 --> 01:04:33.844
Inappropriate.
- Yeah.


1222
01:04:33.979 --> 01:04:36.216
You know, I just don't think
Claire would understand.


1223
01:04:36.347 --> 01:04:37.656
Especially what happened this weekend.

1224
01:04:39.739 --> 01:04:41.463
- You're gonna take that job,
aren't you?


1225
01:04:41.595 --> 01:04:44.377
- Pretty much have to.
I gave so many people my word.


1226
01:04:45.979 --> 01:04:47.255
I dunno.

1227
01:04:53.308 --> 01:04:55.729
- Yo, lovers! How are you?

1228
01:04:57.340 --> 01:04:59.031
- Hey, Terry. How's Amy doing?

1229
01:05:00.220 --> 01:05:02.359
- What can I say.
She's sleeping like a baby.


1230
01:05:04.380 --> 01:05:05.973
- So I guess this is it, huh?

1231
01:05:06.620 --> 01:05:08.246
- Hey, um...

1232
01:05:08.380 --> 01:05:10.933
thanks again
for being so sweet to me last night.


1233
01:05:11.068 --> 01:05:12.857
- Yeah.
- I had a really great time


1234
01:05:12.988 --> 01:05:14.614
getting to know you.
- Me too.


1235
01:05:16.540 --> 01:05:17.653
Okay...

1236
01:05:25.180 --> 01:05:26.293
- Hey!

1237
01:05:27.580 --> 01:05:29.969
You forgot your mother-in-law's pie!

1238
01:05:32.380 --> 01:05:33.656
- Thanks.

1239
01:05:51.741 --> 01:05:54.774
- Now don't try and tell me
there's nothing going on between you two,


1240
01:05:54.909 --> 01:05:56.534
because love is obviously in the air.

1241
01:05:56.668 --> 01:06:00.181
So let's just hold up here a second
and let me ask you a question.


1242
01:06:00.317 --> 01:06:02.073
Are you sure you don't wanna stay

1243
01:06:02.205 --> 01:06:04.060
and take the train home tonight?
I won't be offended.


1244
01:06:04.189 --> 01:06:06.458
- No, I'm fine. Nothing happened.
It's not what you think.


1245
01:06:06.589 --> 01:06:08.661
- Of course, you're the type that
won't kiss and tell. I understand.


1246
01:06:08.796 --> 01:06:11.098
I forgot who I was dealing with.
Now let me smell your finger.


1247
01:06:11.229 --> 01:06:13.814
- That's gross. Can we go?
I wanna go, please.


1248
01:06:15.068 --> 01:06:16.563
- Are you absolutely sure?

1249
01:06:16.701 --> 01:06:19.419
Because even I can tell
that she's in love with you, man.


1250
01:06:20.542 --> 01:06:23.160
She's gonna be the one that got away,
the great missed opportunity


1251
01:06:23.294 --> 01:06:25.465
that's gonna haunt you
for the rest of your life.


1252
01:06:25.598 --> 01:06:28.532
You're gonna be standing on the altar,
about to say ''I do,''


1253
01:06:28.670 --> 01:06:31.419
and the last image
that flashes before your eyes...


1254
01:06:32.062 --> 01:06:34.779
... is gonna be that fucking beauty
on that blue convertible.


1255
01:06:37.341 --> 01:06:40.375
All right, now if you don't think
that is the case...


1256
01:06:41.022 --> 01:06:43.891
... let me know and I will pull out
of this parking lot right now.


1257
01:06:44.542 --> 01:06:47.924
But if you have any doubts at all,

1258
01:06:48.061 --> 01:06:51.738
open that fucking door right now
and run back to her.


1259
01:06:56.861 --> 01:06:58.617
- Can we go home... please?

1260
01:07:01.022 --> 01:07:02.298
- All right, kid.

1261
01:07:05.471 --> 01:07:06.583
Wow!

1262
01:07:31.743 --> 01:07:34.110
- Look, do you mind
if we pull over for a second?


1263
01:07:34.238 --> 01:07:37.500
- What you gotta do? Take a leak?
- No, I'd like to make a phone call.


1264
01:07:37.630 --> 01:07:39.572
And I want a little privacy,
if that's okay.


1265
01:07:39.710 --> 01:07:41.336
- You gotta call the fiancÃ©e, huh?

1266
01:07:41.662 --> 01:07:44.957
The guilt is getting to you already?
- Yes. If you must know, it is.


1267
01:07:45.502 --> 01:07:48.056
- I knew it. I knew it.
I knew you'd tap that ass!


1268
01:07:48.191 --> 01:07:50.809
- No, I didn't tap anything. Okay?
That's not what this is about.


1269
01:07:50.944 --> 01:07:53.977
- All right. All right.
You're not the type that tells.


1270
01:07:56.543 --> 01:07:59.129
Young blood, admit to nothing, okay?

1271
01:07:59.263 --> 01:08:01.052
You're gonna go to the grave with this.

1272
01:08:01.183 --> 01:08:03.190
I know you think it's gonna help
by confessing -


1273
01:08:03.328 --> 01:08:05.215
that knot in your stomach -
but it won't.


1274
01:08:05.343 --> 01:08:07.253
- Shut up. It's ringing. It's ringing.

1275
01:08:11.743 --> 01:08:13.401
- Good morning, asshole.

1276
01:08:13.536 --> 01:08:15.510
<i>- Claire, I can explain.
- Absolutely not.</i>


1277
01:08:15.647 --> 01:08:17.720
No, I'm not gonna let you explain.

1278
01:08:17.855 --> 01:08:19.284
<i>- No, baby. Baby!
- Fuck youI</i>


1279
01:08:19.423 --> 01:08:21.594
I've done nothing
but good things for you,


1280
01:08:21.728 --> 01:08:24.149
and you've... you've taken
my kindness and my charity,


1281
01:08:24.287 --> 01:08:26.709
and my family's charity
and spit in our face.


1282
01:08:26.847 --> 01:08:29.979
So you can go...
you can go fuck yourself, Johnny Rizzo.


1283
01:08:31.073 --> 01:08:32.218
- Shit.

1284
01:08:38.944 --> 01:08:40.373
- That was fast.

1285
01:08:40.704 --> 01:08:42.362
Where did you get this pie?
It's phenomenal.


1286
01:08:42.497 --> 01:08:44.668
- No, Uncle Terry,
that was for my mother-in-law.


1287
01:08:46.784 --> 01:08:48.191
- Oh, shit. I didn't know. I mean...

1288
01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:50.207
I just ate a
little bit of the crust.

1289
01:08:50.336 --> 01:08:53.019
- How am I supposed to give her a pie
without a crust, man?!


1290
01:08:53.664 --> 01:08:55.933
- Sorry, you didn't say anything.
What the fuck? I mean...


1291
01:08:56.064 --> 01:08:57.820
- Where's the purse I bought for Claire?

1292
01:08:58.784 --> 01:09:00.856
- Why you asking me?
- I left it in the backseat.


1293
01:09:01.664 --> 01:09:04.053
Do you see it?
- You left it in the car


1294
01:09:04.192 --> 01:09:06.101
with the doors unlocked
and the windows open?


1295
01:09:06.240 --> 01:09:09.110
I mean, it's the Hamptons,
but come on. You can't do that.


1296
01:09:09.248 --> 01:09:11.157
It's fucking stupid.
- Fuck, she's gonna kill me!


1297
01:09:11.296 --> 01:09:12.858
She's gonna fucking kill me!
Goddammit!!


1298
01:09:13.665 --> 01:09:15.127
- You know what?

1299
01:09:15.265 --> 01:09:18.015
You could maybe...
maybe use this as an opportunity


1300
01:09:18.145 --> 01:09:22.138
to finally stand up for yourself.
You could tell her, ''Hey, look, babe,


1301
01:09:22.273 --> 01:09:24.793
I just didn't have time--''
- Shut up!


1302
01:09:24.929 --> 01:09:27.799
Shut the fuck up!
You are a scumbag!


1303
01:09:27.937 --> 01:09:30.806
My life was fine until you made me
come out here this weekend!


1304
01:09:30.945 --> 01:09:33.182
I'm sick of your shit!
Take me home!


1305
01:09:34.145 --> 01:09:37.014
- Look, I'll put the fucking crust back,
all right?


1306
01:09:38.625 --> 01:09:40.730
Here, look. I'm putting it back.

1307
01:09:40.865 --> 01:09:42.653
- Do me a favour--
- She'll never know the difference.


1308
01:09:42.785 --> 01:09:44.857
- Can we not talk
for the rest of the ride?


1309
01:09:48.321 --> 01:09:49.336
- Fine.

1310
01:10:09.346 --> 01:10:12.096
Here we are.
- I'm sorry I called you a scumbag.


1311
01:10:12.226 --> 01:10:13.655
All right? I didn't mean it.

1312
01:10:14.786 --> 01:10:16.160
- Do me a favour?

1313
01:10:16.290 --> 01:10:18.461
Stop apologizing, man, all right?

1314
01:10:18.786 --> 01:10:20.247
Look, by most people's definition,

1315
01:10:20.386 --> 01:10:23.036
I am a little bit of a scumbag.
And you know what?


1316
01:10:23.170 --> 01:10:25.657
I'm okay with it.
- You're okay with being a scumbag?


1317
01:10:25.794 --> 01:10:27.103
That doesn't make any sense.

1318
01:10:27.586 --> 01:10:32.288
- Well, on the relative scale of things,
I'm a pretty happy guy. Okay?


1319
01:10:32.418 --> 01:10:34.654
So no apology necessary.
- All right.


1320
01:10:34.786 --> 01:10:37.884
- However, if I can, I'd like to give you
one last little bit of advice?


1321
01:10:38.017 --> 01:10:39.425
- More advice?
You're gonna give me more advice?


1322
01:10:39.555 --> 01:10:40.537
Okay, let's hear it.

1323
01:10:40.675 --> 01:10:43.904
- Stop being such
a nice guy, all right?

1324
01:10:44.386 --> 01:10:46.175
You know what they say
about nice guys.


1325
01:10:46.306 --> 01:10:47.681
- They finish last?
- I'm not talking


1326
01:10:47.810 --> 01:10:49.566
about running around chasing girls,
getting laid.


1327
01:10:49.699 --> 01:10:52.219
I know that's not your thing,
you're not that guy.


1328
01:10:52.354 --> 01:10:53.598
You made that abundantly clear.

1329
01:10:53.730 --> 01:10:55.999
But stop worrying
about how everybody else feels, man.


1330
01:10:56.131 --> 01:10:58.814
You gotta start worrying about you.
What makes Johnny happy.


1331
01:11:00.546 --> 01:11:03.067
Okay? Because you're not doing
anybody any favours


1332
01:11:03.203 --> 01:11:05.090
if you're unhappy
and you're dissatisfied.


1333
01:11:05.219 --> 01:11:07.869
I think you know
what I'm talking about.


1334
01:11:09.986 --> 01:11:12.157
- Okay. All right. I'll try.

1335
01:11:12.291 --> 01:11:13.338
- Cool.

1336
01:11:14.786 --> 01:11:16.858
Now do me a favor
and get the hell outta here.


1337
01:11:16.995 --> 01:11:18.489
I gotta get this truck back to Jersey

1338
01:11:18.626 --> 01:11:20.382
before her husband gets home
from his golf weekend.


1339
01:11:21.667 --> 01:11:24.482
I live a charmed life, my friend.
- That you do.


1340
01:11:37.827 --> 01:11:39.769
Hey, Claire, it's me.

1341
01:11:39.907 --> 01:11:43.355
Look, please give me a call back. Okay?
I'm gonna head out to your parents,


1342
01:11:43.491 --> 01:11:45.858
I'd really like to know
what I'm getting myself into.


1343
01:11:45.987 --> 01:11:47.743
Um... I'm wearing the suit!

1344
01:11:48.547 --> 01:11:51.362
Uh, look, if you get this
in the next 10 minutes,


1345
01:11:51.491 --> 01:11:53.052
please give me a call. Okay?

1346
01:11:53.187 --> 01:11:54.299
Um...

1347
01:11:54.948 --> 01:11:56.377
... I love you?

1348
01:12:22.500 --> 01:12:24.093
Baby, it's me again.

1349
01:12:24.228 --> 01:12:26.814
Okay, first of all,
I didn't do anything with that girl.


1350
01:12:26.948 --> 01:12:29.763
Okay? I'm at your dad's house,
we're gonna talk about the interview.


1351
01:12:29.892 --> 01:12:32.543
I'm wearing my suit!
What else can I do for you?


1352
01:12:33.668 --> 01:12:35.424
All right, I'll call you when I'm done.

1353
01:12:39.908 --> 01:12:41.850
- Huh. Sonny!
- Hi, sir.


1354
01:12:41.988 --> 01:12:45.337
- You have managed to get all
of the women in my life really upset.


1355
01:12:45.828 --> 01:12:48.066
My wife is so pissed off at you,
she left the apartment.


1356
01:12:48.197 --> 01:12:50.619
She doesn't even wanna see your face.
- It's been a big misunderstanding, sir.


1357
01:12:50.757 --> 01:12:52.896
I've tried to contact Claire,
she isn't picking up her phone.


1358
01:12:53.029 --> 01:12:54.305
- You blame her?

1359
01:12:54.949 --> 01:12:57.185
Come on, have a seat. Talk to me.

1360
01:12:57.509 --> 01:13:00.575
- Sir, it's not what you think.
It's actually... kind of a funny story.


1361
01:13:00.709 --> 01:13:03.808
I was helping this girl
and I left my phone in my pocket--


1362
01:13:03.941 --> 01:13:05.981
<i>- You don't have
to explain yourself to me.</i>


1363
01:13:06.469 --> 01:13:09.218
I was young once, too,
and I know what you're going through.


1364
01:13:09.349 --> 01:13:10.778
Getting married is terrifying.

1365
01:13:11.269 --> 01:13:14.782
And with good reason.
Marriage is... hard.


1366
01:13:16.197 --> 01:13:18.401
- Sir, I didn't do anything.
I was just helping this girl


1367
01:13:18.533 --> 01:13:21.216
and I left my phone in my pocket.
I gave it to her--


1368
01:13:21.349 --> 01:13:22.942
- I. Don't. Care.

1369
01:13:23.653 --> 01:13:26.620
But what I would like to talk to you
about is this job interview.


1370
01:13:26.757 --> 01:13:29.375
Claire tells me that you're having
second thoughts about that as well.


1371
01:13:29.509 --> 01:13:32.543
- Sir, I love my job. It's the only thing
I ever wanted to do.


1372
01:13:32.677 --> 01:13:34.466
To be honest, I'm really good at it.

1373
01:13:35.430 --> 01:13:38.212
- Tell me something.
How much do you make at that station?


1374
01:13:38.342 --> 01:13:41.603
- Well, right now, not a lot.
But I've been on air for four years,


1375
01:13:41.734 --> 01:13:44.734
I got a nice fan base.
I don't know, maybe one day, it'll--


1376
01:13:44.870 --> 01:13:46.724
- You don't make shit!
- I don't make shit.


1377
01:13:46.854 --> 01:13:48.577
- And you and I both know that.

1378
01:13:48.710 --> 01:13:50.564
And you know
I'm supporting you and Claire.


1379
01:13:50.694 --> 01:13:52.581
- Well, sir,
I don't think that's entirely true.


1380
01:13:52.710 --> 01:13:53.790
- Oh, really?

1381
01:13:53.926 --> 01:13:55.617
Really? It isn't?

1382
01:13:55.750 --> 01:13:58.979
Do you pay the 2,000-a-month rent
for that house, or do I?


1383
01:13:59.109 --> 01:14:00.898
I mean, you know that, right?

1384
01:14:01.029 --> 01:14:03.168
You know that I pay your rent.

1385
01:14:03.301 --> 01:14:07.393
You are included in these monthly
conversations about bills.


1386
01:14:07.526 --> 01:14:09.435
It's not just Claire sitting there
with a calculator


1387
01:14:09.574 --> 01:14:11.777
and a chequebook every month.
- No, of course not, sir.


1388
01:14:11.910 --> 01:14:14.977
And I told Claire I think we don't need
to live in such a nice place.


1389
01:14:15.111 --> 01:14:17.086
We could eat out less
and maybe take the bus.


1390
01:14:17.223 --> 01:14:18.946
- And how about Claire's car?

1391
01:14:20.070 --> 01:14:21.499
And her car insurance?

1392
01:14:22.471 --> 01:14:24.609
And that trip you two took
to Cabo last year?


1393
01:14:24.743 --> 01:14:27.426
- I understand, Mr. Meadows,
but I never really wanted to go to Cabo--


1394
01:14:27.558 --> 01:14:30.014
- Dr. Meadows.
- Dr.--


1395
01:14:30.151 --> 01:14:33.380
- If you don't mind. I busted my ass,
got through medical school.


1396
01:14:33.510 --> 01:14:36.325
I think I've earned the right
to be called Doctor. Yeah.


1397
01:14:36.454 --> 01:14:37.534
- Of course.
- Okay.


1398
01:14:37.670 --> 01:14:40.540
- Dr. Meadows, try to see
where I'm coming from here.


1399
01:14:40.679 --> 01:14:43.330
This is my dream.
I went to journalism school.


1400
01:14:43.463 --> 01:14:46.081
This is what I wanna do
and I don't wanna give it up.


1401
01:14:46.215 --> 01:14:48.833
And I don't think I have to.
Claire and I are still young.


1402
01:14:48.967 --> 01:14:50.974
We don't have to live
in such a nice place.


1403
01:14:51.110 --> 01:14:53.282
We can cut down on our expenses,
be happy with...


1404
01:14:53.415 --> 01:14:54.822
with less.

1405
01:14:54.950 --> 01:14:58.148
- You obviously don't know Claire
very well, do you?


1406
01:14:59.912 --> 01:15:02.333
Tell me something.
What does your...


1407
01:15:02.471 --> 01:15:06.181
dream... pay for,
while I'm paying for everything else?


1408
01:15:08.551 --> 01:15:09.980
- It makes me happy.

1409
01:15:12.104 --> 01:15:13.511
- It makes you happy.

1410
01:15:13.831 --> 01:15:16.995
You have got one swinging pair of balls
on you, kid.


1411
01:15:17.831 --> 01:15:19.358
- Look, Mr. ... Dr. Meadows,

1412
01:15:19.495 --> 01:15:22.626
I understand
what kind of opportunity this is.


1413
01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:25.181
I do. And I appreciate it.

1414
01:15:25.831 --> 01:15:28.253
So I guess I
am willing to sit down

1415
01:15:28.391 --> 01:15:30.301
with your friend tomorrow
and discuss it?


1416
01:15:30.440 --> 01:15:33.701
If that's okay?
- You're willing to sit down


1417
01:15:33.832 --> 01:15:35.293
and discuss it?

1418
01:15:35.431 --> 01:15:37.220
How very white of you.

1419
01:15:37.351 --> 01:15:39.620
You gotta be out of your fucking mind!

1420
01:15:39.751 --> 01:15:41.345
I cancelled the interview.

1421
01:15:42.313 --> 01:15:44.734
This is a very important man
with a business to run.


1422
01:15:44.872 --> 01:15:47.906
I can't risk wasting his time
with your wishy-washy attitude.


1423
01:15:49.032 --> 01:15:52.381
My advice to you
is to get on a plane back to Claire,


1424
01:15:52.521 --> 01:15:54.626
and see if you can salvage
your relationship.


1425
01:15:55.432 --> 01:15:57.669
Now you know your way out.
Good night.


1426
01:16:08.552 --> 01:16:09.697
- Jimmy.

1427
01:16:09.832 --> 01:16:11.294
Hey, man, it's me.

1428
01:16:11.432 --> 01:16:13.821
Please tell me you didn't give away
my time slot yet.


1429
01:16:14.472 --> 01:16:16.577
You didn't. That's perfect. Don't.

1430
01:16:16.712 --> 01:16:18.468
I'm not taking the job in New York.

1431
01:16:18.953 --> 01:16:21.341
That's great.
I'll tell you when I see you, all right?


1432
01:16:21.672 --> 01:16:23.265
All right, man. Bye.

1433
01:17:05.033 --> 01:17:05.982
- Claire?

1434
01:17:09.194 --> 01:17:10.623
Baby, you home?

1435
01:17:10.953 --> 01:17:12.382
- Yeah, I'm in here.

1436
01:17:18.314 --> 01:17:19.591
Hey, baby.

1437
01:17:20.074 --> 01:17:22.791
Do me a favour, come sit down.
- Yeah.


1438
01:17:23.433 --> 01:17:25.189
- We need to talk.
- Yeah.


1439
01:17:28.714 --> 01:17:31.910
Um... you know
nothing happened, right?


1440
01:17:32.874 --> 01:17:34.947
- Yeah, I know. I know.
- Okay.


1441
01:17:35.754 --> 01:17:37.859
- And... I apologize

1442
01:17:37.994 --> 01:17:40.230
for not taking
any of your phone calls...


1443
01:17:40.554 --> 01:17:42.659
... but I was understandably upset.

1444
01:17:42.794 --> 01:17:45.063
- Right. But you know I didn't cheat.

1445
01:17:45.194 --> 01:17:47.780
All right, I'm not that guy.
I'm not wired that way.


1446
01:17:47.914 --> 01:17:49.823
- Yeah, I know. I know.
- Okay.


1447
01:17:50.635 --> 01:17:54.148
- I guess I have to take
some responsibility, because...


1448
01:17:54.635 --> 01:17:57.024
... I should never have let you go
to New York alone.


1449
01:17:57.994 --> 01:17:59.456
We hatched this plan together,

1450
01:17:59.595 --> 01:18:01.667
and I should've been there
to support you.


1451
01:18:03.435 --> 01:18:05.377
Okay, but I have some good news.

1452
01:18:05.515 --> 01:18:08.712
Um... I've already talked to my father...

1453
01:18:09.514 --> 01:18:11.303
... and he's not mad anymore.

1454
01:18:11.755 --> 01:18:14.624
At least he's not as furious
and he's still willing to help.


1455
01:18:15.915 --> 01:18:18.435
- No, baby. I
don't want his help, okay?

1456
01:18:18.570 --> 01:18:22.083
I think he's helped us enough.
He made that painfully clear.


1457
01:18:22.954 --> 01:18:25.191
- Okay, well, you need his help.

1458
01:18:25.675 --> 01:18:27.530
And he's willing
to reschedule the interview.


1459
01:18:27.658 --> 01:18:29.284
- I don't wanna do the interview.

1460
01:18:29.419 --> 01:18:31.623
Babe, can't you see
where I'm coming from?


1461
01:18:31.754 --> 01:18:35.465
I like my job. It's who I am.
It's what makes me happy.


1462
01:18:35.595 --> 01:18:38.857
And I get it.
I get where you're coming from, okay?


1463
01:18:38.987 --> 01:18:41.224
And some things in a marriage
you need to compromise,


1464
01:18:41.355 --> 01:18:44.105
but some things can't be compromised,
some things need to be supported.


1465
01:18:44.235 --> 01:18:46.308
- Like what?
- Like my dreams! I dunno.


1466
01:18:46.444 --> 01:18:48.102
I dunno.

1467
01:18:48.235 --> 01:18:49.512
But, baby...

1468
01:18:50.636 --> 01:18:52.097
Nothing would make me happier

1469
01:18:52.236 --> 01:18:54.472
that for you to support my dream
right now.


1470
01:18:58.635 --> 01:18:59.944
- Johnny...

1471
01:19:00.076 --> 01:19:01.985
what about my dreams?

1472
01:19:04.076 --> 01:19:05.537
I'm at a point in my life

1473
01:19:05.675 --> 01:19:08.064
where I have to
go after what I want.

1474
01:19:08.555 --> 01:19:10.181
I'm 24 years old!

1475
01:19:10.315 --> 01:19:14.025
I'm not gonna wait till I'm 30
to live the life I wanna live.


1476
01:19:14.155 --> 01:19:18.085
I'm not going to gamble my happiness
on some off-chance


1477
01:19:18.221 --> 01:19:21.155
that you might be successful
as a sportscaster.


1478
01:19:21.676 --> 01:19:23.302
- What do you mean,
you're not gonna wait?


1479
01:19:23.436 --> 01:19:24.548
What does that mean?

1480
01:19:26.157 --> 01:19:27.750
Are you saying the wedding's off?

1481
01:19:28.556 --> 01:19:29.484
- No...

1482
01:19:30.797 --> 01:19:34.953
Not as long as you keep a promise
that you made to me.


1483
01:19:35.084 --> 01:19:38.313
Which means going to New York
and taking that job.


1484
01:19:41.036 --> 01:19:43.425
- Baby, you're gonna think
I'm being selfish...


1485
01:19:44.236 --> 01:19:45.829
... and maybe I am, but...

1486
01:19:46.636 --> 01:19:48.545
... I gotta do what makes me happy.

1487
01:19:49.516 --> 01:19:51.109
I'm not leaving my job.

1488
01:19:59.276 --> 01:20:00.554
- Okay...

1489
01:20:04.397 --> 01:20:06.786
Then I guess... we're through.

1490
01:20:16.397 --> 01:20:18.022
Oh, uh, you didn't...

1491
01:20:18.157 --> 01:20:19.750
pick up my bag, did you?

1492
01:20:20.717 --> 01:20:21.994
- Actually, it...

1493
01:20:23.117 --> 01:20:24.546
... must've slipped my mind.

1494
01:20:26.477 --> 01:20:27.590
- Figures.

1495
01:20:33.677 --> 01:20:35.368
- It's a lost art,
the artist stealing home,


1496
01:20:35.501 --> 01:20:38.054
and I'm not talking about
the back end of a double steal,


1497
01:20:38.189 --> 01:20:39.945
I am not talking
about the suicide squeeze.


1498
01:20:40.077 --> 01:20:43.821
I am talking about a pure steal of home.
Never happens anymore.


1499
01:20:43.950 --> 01:20:45.859
Now some say it's because pitchers

1500
01:20:45.998 --> 01:20:47.459
don't have a long windup anymore,

1501
01:20:47.598 --> 01:20:49.671
even when there's someone on third.
I don't buy it.


1502
01:20:49.806 --> 01:20:52.872
I think... the reason is fear.

1503
01:20:53.678 --> 01:20:56.580
I think base runners today
have a fear of confrontation,


1504
01:20:56.718 --> 01:20:59.685
a fear of confrontation at home plate.
Think about it.


1505
01:20:59.822 --> 01:21:02.440
They fear the batter
is gonna miss the signal


1506
01:21:02.574 --> 01:21:04.908
and swing away
right as they cross home.


1507
01:21:05.038 --> 01:21:07.755
They fear the baseball,
travelling 100 miles an hour


1508
01:21:07.886 --> 01:21:09.412
has the same destination as their face.

1509
01:21:09.550 --> 01:21:11.524
They fear a collision
with the catcher at home.


1510
01:21:11.662 --> 01:21:13.637
All these things can happen
when you steal home,


1511
01:21:13.774 --> 01:21:15.432
which is why it's a lost art.

1512
01:21:15.566 --> 01:21:19.494
But I think it's time for players
to start playing a little more reckless.


1513
01:21:19.630 --> 01:21:23.013
I think it's time for them
to face their fear of confrontation


1514
01:21:23.150 --> 01:21:26.533
and go for it, steal home,
take the chance, inspire the team,


1515
01:21:26.671 --> 01:21:28.744
because sometimes,
when you go for it,


1516
01:21:28.879 --> 01:21:30.701
the payoff can be huge.

1517
01:21:30.831 --> 01:21:34.791
You're listening to Nice Guy Johnny,
and that was your Daily Dose.


1518
01:21:35.759 --> 01:21:39.054
Let's jump on the line
and get a couple of callers.


1519
01:21:39.183 --> 01:21:42.249
This one's interesting.
This is from a...


1520
01:21:42.383 --> 01:21:45.067
first-time caller, long-time admirer,

1521
01:21:45.199 --> 01:21:48.101
Brooke, from Los Angeles
by way of Long Island.


1522
01:21:48.239 --> 01:21:49.188
Ahem.

1523
01:21:50.318 --> 01:21:53.701
Hello, Brooke, you're on the air.
What would you like to talk about?


1524
01:21:53.839 --> 01:21:57.384
<i>- Well, I actually have
a non-sports-related question,</i>


1525
01:21:57.519 --> 01:21:59.144
<i>if that's okay?
- Okay.</i>


1526
01:21:59.279 --> 01:22:01.166
I guess it depends on the question.

1527
01:22:01.294 --> 01:22:03.716
<i>- Yeah, it's sort of more
of a personal nature.</i>


1528
01:22:03.855 --> 01:22:06.670
<i>Do you take those?
- Well, this isn't Love Line, Brooke,</i>


1529
01:22:06.798 --> 01:22:10.182
but I think for this caller
I can make an exception.


1530
01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:11.498
Shoot.

1531
01:22:11.632 --> 01:22:14.948
<i>- Well, I wasjust wondering
if your tennis game has improved any?</i>


1532
01:22:15.439 --> 01:22:18.374
- That's funny. That's funny.
For your information, it has not.


1533
01:22:18.512 --> 01:22:20.901
I still haven't found
a good tennis instructor.


1534
01:22:21.039 --> 01:22:24.170
<i>- Good to know you're still on the air,
doing what you love.</i>


1535
01:22:24.304 --> 01:22:27.784
- Yeah, well, I couldn't walk away
from the best job in the biz.


1536
01:22:27.919 --> 01:22:30.024
Cost me my engagement, but, uh...

1537
01:22:30.160 --> 01:22:32.265
<i>
- Well, I'm... sorry to hear that.</i>

1538
01:22:32.400 --> 01:22:34.888
- No, it's okay.
I think it's for the best.


1539
01:22:35.024 --> 01:22:36.649
I'm not doing the overnight anymore.

1540
01:22:36.784 --> 01:22:39.915
I'm here on the afternoon drive slot,
so it worked out.


1541
01:22:41.199 --> 01:22:42.693
So, listeners, in case you're wondering,

1542
01:22:42.831 --> 01:22:44.620
I am speaking with the very lovely,

1543
01:22:44.751 --> 01:22:46.344
lovely Brooke Palson,

1544
01:22:46.480 --> 01:22:49.862
recent grad and All Conference
tennis star at Loyola Marymount,


1545
01:22:49.999 --> 01:22:51.592
down in Los Angeles.

1546
01:22:52.079 --> 01:22:53.542
So, Brooke...

1547
01:22:53.680 --> 01:22:55.022
enquiring minds wanna know...

1548
01:22:55.152 --> 01:22:57.225
what have you been up to?

1549
01:22:57.361 --> 01:23:00.710
<i>- I am on the road.
I'm taking that trip I told you about.</i>


1550
01:23:00.849 --> 01:23:02.954
<i>Your show came in
about an hour ago.</i>


1551
01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:05.356
- So that means
you're close to Oaktown.


1552
01:23:05.968 --> 01:23:07.910
- I don't know, how far is Napa?

1553
01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:10.058
<i>- Close enough
that if you didn't stop in</i>


1554
01:23:10.193 --> 01:23:12.135
<i>and say hello,
I might be a little offended?</i>


1555
01:23:12.273 --> 01:23:13.353
Uh...

1556
01:23:13.840 --> 01:23:16.906
So what are you doing?
Are you headed home to L.A.,


1557
01:23:17.040 --> 01:23:18.534
or are you thinking about, uh...

1558
01:23:18.673 --> 01:23:20.811
swinging by the Bay Area,
by any chance?


1559
01:23:20.944 --> 01:23:23.727
- You know what, man?
I'm just goin' where the road takes me.


1560
01:23:23.856 --> 01:23:26.245
<i>- Well, I hope that road takes you
to the studio,</i>


1561
01:23:26.384 --> 01:23:30.028
because I would love
to get that interview I was promised.


1562
01:23:30.160 --> 01:23:31.720
- Oh... Really?

1563
01:23:31.856 --> 01:23:33.449
<i>
- I would.</i>

1564
01:23:33.585 --> 01:23:36.106
<i>- You know,
a little begging might be in order.</i>


1565
01:23:36.241 --> 01:23:38.630
- Okay. All right. I'll beg.

1566
01:23:39.281 --> 01:23:42.031
And I think I owe you
a thank-you, as well.


1567
01:23:42.161 --> 01:23:45.227
You're the one that convinced me
I would be an idiot to leave this job.


1568
01:23:45.362 --> 01:23:46.474
So, um...

1569
01:23:47.121 --> 01:23:50.318
...here we go. Listen closely,
'cause I'm only gonna do this once.


1570
01:23:51.122 --> 01:23:53.839
Please, oh, please, Brooke,
will you come to the studio


1571
01:23:53.969 --> 01:23:55.627
so I can get that interview?

1572
01:23:56.081 --> 01:23:58.634
- You just made my father's day.

1573
01:23:58.769 --> 01:24:00.744
- Great. That makes me very happy.

1574
01:24:00.881 --> 01:24:04.710
Um... why don't you stay on the line
and I can tell you how to get here, okay?


1575
01:24:04.849 --> 01:24:07.467
<i>All right, sports fans,
I think we're in for a treat.</i>


1576
01:24:07.601 --> 01:24:08.877
<i>Especially me.</i>

1577
01:24:09.010 --> 01:24:11.465
Uh... we're gonna take
a quick commercial break.


1578
01:24:11.601 --> 01:24:14.318
You're listening to Nice Guy Johnny

1579
01:24:14.449 --> 01:24:17.711
on Oakland's
number-one sports talk, KSPT,


1580
01:24:17.841 --> 01:24:19.119
the K
-Spot.

1581
01:24:20.722 --> 01:24:23.756
<i>It's a voice in
the back of your mind</i>

1582
01:24:24.882 --> 01:24:26.954
<i>Oh oh oh oh oh oh</i>

1583
01:24:27.762 --> 01:24:31.275
<i>It's a song
It's a beautiful rhyme</i>


1584
01:24:32.082 --> 01:24:33.871
<i>Brooke?
Oh oh oh oh oh oh</i>


1585
01:24:34.642 --> 01:24:37.991
<i>It gets louder and louder each time</i>

1586
01:24:39.282 --> 01:24:41.518
<i>Oh oh oh oh oh oh</i>

1587
01:24:42.002 --> 01:24:45.036
<i>It's a sign that
you find me all right</i>

1588
01:24:46.642 --> 01:24:48.104
<i>Oh oh oh oh oh oh</i>

1589
01:24:48.242 --> 01:24:51.308
<i>Step outside and off the bus</i>

1590
01:24:51.442 --> 01:24:55.152
<i>There's more to life
there's more to us</i>


1591
01:24:55.282 --> 01:24:58.479
<i>The window is open wide</i>

1592
01:24:59.922 --> 01:25:01.711
<i>Open for more</i>

1593
01:25:01.843 --> 01:25:03.469
<i>Oh oh oh</i>

1594
01:25:03.603 --> 01:25:05.391
<i>Open for more</i>

1595
01:25:05.523 --> 01:25:06.984
<i>Oh oh oh</i>

1596
01:25:07.122 --> 01:25:09.065
<i>Open for more</i>

1597
01:25:09.203 --> 01:25:10.512
<i>Oh oh oh</i>

1598
01:25:10.643 --> 01:25:12.748
<i>Open for more</i>

1599
01:25:12.882 --> 01:25:14.311
<i>Oh oh oh</i>

1600
01:25:30.803 --> 01:25:33.356
<i>Watch the water rushing over me</i>

1601
01:25:33.683 --> 01:25:36.716
<i>See the world as it's meant to be</i>

1602
01:25:37.523 --> 01:25:39.759
<i>It's wonderful</i>

1603
01:25:40.722 --> 01:25:42.632
<i>It's wonderful</i>

1604
01:25:43.283 --> 01:25:46.186
<i>See the sun as it meets the sea</i>

1605
01:25:46.324 --> 01:25:49.521
<i>See the light as it comes to me</i>

1606
01:25:50.164 --> 01:25:52.553
<i>It's beautiful</i>

1607
01:25:53.524 --> 01:25:55.760
<i>Like summertime</i>

1608
01:26:03.444 --> 01:26:05.516
<i>It's beautiful</i>

1609
01:26:06.484 --> 01:26:09.201
<i>This life</i>
