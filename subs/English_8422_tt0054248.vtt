1
00:03:32.423 --> 00:03:35.176
Wake up, come on.
We're in Milan.


2
00:03:36.092 --> 00:03:38.345
Get up, Luca, we're here.

3
00:03:40.972 --> 00:03:41.972
At last!

4
00:03:45.602 --> 00:03:46.853
Come on, Mamma.

5
00:03:49.606 --> 00:03:50.732
Are you tired?

6
00:04:00.367 --> 00:04:02.201
Rocco, the basket.

7
00:04:17.008 --> 00:04:18.552
Ma, got everything?

8
00:04:19.177 --> 00:04:22.095
- You tired?
- You're sure you have everything?


9
00:04:22.096 --> 00:04:24.891
- Where's Vincenzo?
- I don't know.


10
00:04:25.016 --> 00:04:28.226
- Why isn't he here yet?
- Maybe he's outside.


11
00:04:28.227 --> 00:04:30.730
Why isn't Vincenzo here?

12
00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:35.568
- Why isn't Vincenzo here?
- I can't see, you look.


13
00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:36.569
Here!

14
00:04:39.113 --> 00:04:41.074
Ma, want me to look for him?

15
00:04:41.074 --> 00:04:43.076
- Don't get lost.
- Sure!


16
00:04:59.426 --> 00:05:01.010
There's nobody here.

17
00:05:46.348 --> 00:05:47.474
How beautiful!

18
00:05:51.603 --> 00:05:54.731
- Ciro, look how nice!
- Big, isn't it?


19
00:05:59.278 --> 00:06:01.237
What a city!

20
00:06:04.115 --> 00:06:07.244
Rocco, look at those
shops, the lights.


21
00:06:08.953 --> 00:06:10.497
It's like daylight.

22
00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.081
Listen!

23
00:06:15.794 --> 00:06:18.297
What stop is near this address?

24
00:06:18.463 --> 00:06:21.132
- Last stop.
- Last stop?


25
00:06:21.383 --> 00:06:24.385
Last stop, end of the line.
At Lambrate.


26
00:06:24.386 --> 00:06:27.180
- What then?
- Get off at Lambrate.


27
00:06:28.932 --> 00:06:30.600
- My son.
- Your son?


28
00:06:30.809 --> 00:06:33.143
- The oldest...
- Oh, the oldest.


29
00:06:33.144 --> 00:06:35.314
We're going to see him.

30
00:06:37.772 --> 00:06:40.775
Let's toast the fiancés!

31
00:06:40.984 --> 00:06:43.069
Best wishes! All the best!

32
00:06:46.365 --> 00:06:50.702
One always ends up drinking
too much at these parties.


33
00:06:52.871 --> 00:06:53.872
Here we are!

34
00:06:55.332 --> 00:06:56.791
Thank you, thanks.

35
00:06:57.709 --> 00:06:59.794
They decided on their own.

36
00:07:00.545 --> 00:07:02.797
Parents don't count anymore.

37
00:07:04.591 --> 00:07:06.968
We had to start sometime.

38
00:07:08.762 --> 00:07:12.682
Besides, I don't feel
like going back down there.


39
00:07:13.433 --> 00:07:16.686
I want to raise my family up here.

40
00:07:17.729 --> 00:07:20.231
Why don't you get married too?

41
00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:23.527
Me? Only my sister's that dumb.

42
00:07:30.033 --> 00:07:32.702
He's worried about supporting us.

43
00:07:32.869 --> 00:07:35.330
But we'll manage on our own.

44
00:07:35.539 --> 00:07:38.375
- That's right.
- Right, Vincenzo?


45
00:07:41.378 --> 00:07:42.378
Thanks.

46
00:07:50.679 --> 00:07:54.139
- We're not looking for anything.
- Oh, Lord! Please...


47
00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:55.183
This is Aldo.

48
00:07:56.225 --> 00:07:58.144
I'm going to the movies.

49
00:07:59.228 --> 00:08:01.398
- Have fun!
- Bye!


50
00:08:03.483 --> 00:08:05.652
- Bye, Ma.
- Bye. Have fun.


51
00:08:07.446 --> 00:08:08.822
Thank you.

52
00:08:08.988 --> 00:08:12.366
Always the movies!
He lives on bread and movies.


53
00:08:12.367 --> 00:08:14.369
It's a fixation with him!

54
00:08:14.411 --> 00:08:16.830
Sunday I went along too..

55
00:08:17.038 --> 00:08:19.458
And immediately fell asleep.

56
00:08:21.626 --> 00:08:24.713
Hello.
Do the Giannellis live here?


57
00:08:25.714 --> 00:08:27.799
I'm Mrs. Parondi.

58
00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:30.468
Vincenzo,
come and see who's here.


59
00:08:30.469 --> 00:08:33.221
- Come in, come in.
- Thank you.


60
00:08:35.515 --> 00:08:36.558
Mamma!

61
00:08:38.935 --> 00:08:40.895
Oh, my son.

62
00:08:44.274 --> 00:08:46.360
Luca, how are you?

63
00:08:50.364 --> 00:08:52.824
Rosaria, dear Rosaria.

64
00:08:55.034 --> 00:08:58.955
Your family?
Oh, God bless you!


65
00:08:59.873 --> 00:09:02.041
This is Rosaria, everybody.

66
00:09:03.335 --> 00:09:05.086
They're your brothers?

67
00:09:05.545 --> 00:09:07.464
- This is Luca.
- Hello.


68
00:09:07.756 --> 00:09:09.924
Simone. She's my fiancé.

69
00:09:10.133 --> 00:09:12.302
- Good.
- Rocco..


70
00:09:12.511 --> 00:09:14.095
And Ciro.
- Hello.


71
00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:16.764
Leave everything here
and come inside.


72
00:09:16.765 --> 00:09:17.765
Come on.

73
00:09:20.184 --> 00:09:21.184
Come inside.

74
00:09:22.854 --> 00:09:25.106
It's her, Vincenzo's mother!

75
00:09:25.274 --> 00:09:28.985
What a long trip.
Offer her some wine.


76
00:09:29.486 --> 00:09:31.446
Come on, boys!

77
00:09:34.408 --> 00:09:38.328
Offer them some wine,
they must be freezing.


78
00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:42.164
Handsome boys, huh?
The picture of their mother.


79
00:09:42.165 --> 00:09:44.793
Ginetta, pass the cookies around.

80
00:09:44.918 --> 00:09:47.837
Really handsome boys.
Tired, huh?


81
00:09:48.713 --> 00:09:51.300
It's true, they're very similar.

82
00:09:51.758 --> 00:09:54.928
They're dead tired.
Such a long trip!


83
00:09:55.094 --> 00:09:59.140
- What a nice surprise!
- What's in there?


84
00:10:00.392 --> 00:10:03.853
What misfortune
came upon us, my dear son!


85
00:10:10.485 --> 00:10:11.528
What is this?

86
00:10:11.861 --> 00:10:14.405
Don't you wear mourning
for your father?


87
00:10:14.406 --> 00:10:15.406
No,..

88
00:10:15.699 --> 00:10:17.242
It's just that...

89
00:10:18.159 --> 00:10:21.745
She's Ginetta. I wrote you
about our engagement.


90
00:10:21.746 --> 00:10:25.500
You arrived
just in time to bless us.


91
00:10:25.709 --> 00:10:26.709
Marriage?

92
00:10:27.419 --> 00:10:31.255
You're so rich that you
can marry? Especially now..


93
00:10:31.256 --> 00:10:34.634
With your whole family
depending on you?


94
00:10:34.968 --> 00:10:37.178
If only you'd written..

95
00:10:37.387 --> 00:10:40.098
And let me know!
- We did write!


96
00:10:40.807 --> 00:10:43.935
Yes, but that was
when Papa died.


97
00:10:44.769 --> 00:10:49.524
I answered: "First I have
to find them a job".


98
00:10:49.774 --> 00:10:52.902
It's not that easy here in Milan.

99
00:10:53.152 --> 00:10:56.071
- Have a seat.
- Make yourselves comfortable.


100
00:10:56.072 --> 00:10:59.242
- Tell us about yourselves.
- Let's hear.


101
00:10:59.243 --> 00:11:01.661
Make yourself at home.

102
00:11:02.161 --> 00:11:05.249
- He's shy.
- Probably tired.


103
00:11:06.124 --> 00:11:08.876
- Not really.
- No? Naturally, he's young.


104
00:11:08.877 --> 00:11:10.754
Were you cold?

105
00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:12.881
- No.
- Some candy?


106
00:11:14.799 --> 00:11:17.802
And what have you got there?

107
00:11:18.094 --> 00:11:19.012
Oranges.

108
00:11:19.013 --> 00:11:22.098
Amelia!
Oranges from our hometown.


109
00:11:22.266 --> 00:11:24.976
- Would you like one?
- Thank you.


110
00:11:26.478 --> 00:11:28.355
Just smell!

111
00:11:30.315 --> 00:11:31.315
Thank you.

112
00:11:32.901 --> 00:11:36.445
Listen, Rosaria, I thought
you came for their engagement.


113
00:11:36.446 --> 00:11:41.576
And that Vincenzo said nothing
because he wanted to surprise us.


114
00:11:43.287 --> 00:11:46.831
My heart's too heavy
to think about parties.


115
00:11:46.956 --> 00:11:50.377
And now what?
You came here straight..


116
00:11:50.585 --> 00:11:52.671
From the station?
- Yes.


117
00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:56.550
So where
are you gonna sleep tonight?


118
00:11:58.635 --> 00:12:01.513
My son won't leave us
in the street.


119
00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:04.308
He'll take care of us.

120
00:12:05.183 --> 00:12:08.353
Listen here, Rosaria.

121
00:12:08.937 --> 00:12:13.231
I can understand your being
worried about your boys,..


122
00:12:13.232 --> 00:12:16.235
But what about my girl, huh?!

123
00:12:18.905 --> 00:12:22.616
She arrives just like that,
and ruins everything!


124
00:12:22.617 --> 00:12:25.494
- Mamma, what are you saying?
- Mamma's right.


125
00:12:25.495 --> 00:12:28.247
- You don't understand.
- I'm nobody's fool.


126
00:12:28.248 --> 00:12:30.249
- There's no need to shout!
- Mamma's right!


127
00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:33.419
Let's get out of this house!
Rocco! Simone!


128
00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:36.256
- Mamma, no!
- You're all crazy!


129
00:12:36.423 --> 00:12:41.093
- Come to your mother.
- I'm not crazy. I've understood, all right.


130
00:12:41.094 --> 00:12:44.848
They want to keep you
from helping your mother.


131
00:12:45.056 --> 00:12:49.060
They've no respect
for your dead father! Heathens!


132
00:12:49.269 --> 00:12:50.812
How dare you!

133
00:12:51.313 --> 00:12:54.232
- Let's get out!
- No, no.


134
00:12:54.399 --> 00:12:57.235
Quiet, you, you're one of them!

135
00:12:57.652 --> 00:13:00.113
Let's, boys, hurry up!

136
00:13:02.782 --> 00:13:06.076
God will punish you,
for He judges everyone.


137
00:13:06.077 --> 00:13:09.162
No, wait. They didn't mean
to offend you.


138
00:13:09.163 --> 00:13:12.166
- Move it.
- Leave me, leave me!


139
00:13:12.376 --> 00:13:15.878
- You keep quiet, jerk!
- Think I'm afraid, do you?


140
00:13:15.879 --> 00:13:18.172
Leave my house!

141
00:13:18.632 --> 00:13:22.261
Hear that? What are you
waiting for? Come on!


142
00:13:23.553 --> 00:13:24.721
Get out!

143
00:13:32.729 --> 00:13:33.729
Armando!

144
00:13:37.359 --> 00:13:40.529
- Armando!
- Who is it?


145
00:13:43.156 --> 00:13:45.450
It's Vincenzo.
Let me in.


146
00:13:46.451 --> 00:13:51.122
What's wrong?
How come so late?


147
00:13:51.331 --> 00:13:52.874
I'll explain later.

148
00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:55.460
Hurry up! It's cold!

149
00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:03.593
So why are you here
at this hour?


150
00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:06.763
To sleep, if possible.

151
00:14:06.971 --> 00:14:09.474
It's almost day already.

152
00:14:09.683 --> 00:14:12.602
Let's hear, boy,
what've you done?


153
00:14:12.769 --> 00:14:14.771
I can explain everything.

154
00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:16.940
Down!

155
00:14:18.733 --> 00:14:21.820
Come on in.
You're afraid of the dogs?


156
00:14:22.279 --> 00:14:25.907
Here there's wood, a stove,
all the comforts!


157
00:14:28.785 --> 00:14:30.245
So explain.

158
00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:35.792
My whole family arrived
unexpectedly, like an earthquake..


159
00:14:36.167 --> 00:14:39.463
And then argued
with my future in-laws.


160
00:14:40.171 --> 00:14:44.551
I had to give up my room,
my fiancé and everything.


161
00:14:45.927 --> 00:14:49.973
For you, a room and a fiancé
are the same thing?


162
00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:53.226
- It's no joke.
- No.


163
00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:55.978
How can I support
my whole family?


164
00:14:55.979 --> 00:14:58.898
Where'll they stay?

165
00:14:59.107 --> 00:15:01.233
I managed something for tonight,..

166
00:15:01.234 --> 00:15:03.987
But tomorrow?
Good God!


167
00:15:04.237 --> 00:15:09.743
What's the problem?
Milan's full of empty houses.


168
00:15:10.201 --> 00:15:14.289
Apartment buildings are
shooting up like mushrooms.


169
00:15:14.664 --> 00:15:16.250
What about the rent?

170
00:15:16.875 --> 00:15:20.504
Listen to me, do what all
you Southerners do.


171
00:15:20.587 --> 00:15:23.046
- Know what I mean?
- Not exactly.


172
00:15:23.047 --> 00:15:26.343
You rent a public housing
apartment and..


173
00:15:26.551 --> 00:15:28.678
If you can, you pay.

174
00:15:28.887 --> 00:15:31.472
But after a few months
you stop paying.


175
00:15:31.473 --> 00:15:33.350
- How is that?
- Wait!


176
00:15:33.558 --> 00:15:36.311
A month later they evict you.

177
00:15:36.561 --> 00:15:38.397
- How can I...
- Wait!


178
00:15:38.605 --> 00:15:42.316
Then you join
the other evictees where you pay..


179
00:15:42.317 --> 00:15:45.569
Almost nothing and there's
central heating, electricity, etc.


180
00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:49.949
Milan's City Hall
leaves no one on the street.


181
00:15:50.242 --> 00:15:52.618
Couldn't we go straight there?

182
00:15:52.619 --> 00:15:55.121
No, you have to be evicted.

183
00:15:55.747 --> 00:15:58.749
- Ah, right!
- That's the secret, understand?


184
00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:02.421
- Good evening.
- Don't be such a knucklehead!


185
00:16:17.018 --> 00:16:18.102
Porter!

186
00:16:20.564 --> 00:16:21.773
Porter!

187
00:16:22.231 --> 00:16:23.358
Huh?

188
00:16:23.858 --> 00:16:26.403
I'm Mrs. Parondi, open up!

189
00:16:26.695 --> 00:16:30.907
I'm coming! Hold on!

190
00:16:32.451 --> 00:16:35.995
- What's the big rush?!
- Is this the place?


191
00:16:36.204 --> 00:16:39.123
- There.
- I'm Rosaria Parondi.


192
00:16:39.333 --> 00:16:42.711
Yes, Parondi, it's over there.

193
00:16:42.961 --> 00:16:45.380
Downstairs, lower level.

194
00:16:46.005 --> 00:16:47.549
Get a load of them.

195
00:17:04.733 --> 00:17:06.609
Good morning, Signora Maria.

196
00:17:06.610 --> 00:17:09.903
Did you see those dreadful people?
Zulus!


197
00:17:09.904 --> 00:17:12.531
- Where are they from?
- Lucania.


198
00:17:12.532 --> 00:17:15.158
Lucania? Odd name! Where's that?
Never heard of it.


199
00:17:15.159 --> 00:17:16.953
Down South.

200
00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:20.457
Ahh!
The land of do-nothings!


201
00:18:06.878 --> 00:18:08.672
Wake up!

202
00:18:09.339 --> 00:18:10.339
Ciro.

203
00:18:10.382 --> 00:18:11.841
It's snowing.

204
00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:14.969
Rocco!
There's work for everybody.


205
00:18:15.219 --> 00:18:17.639
Simone! It's snowing.

206
00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:22.311
What happened?

207
00:18:22.561 --> 00:18:24.895
Nothing.
Today there's work for us.


208
00:18:24.896 --> 00:18:25.896
The snow.

209
00:18:26.606 --> 00:18:28.482
It's sticking to the ground!

210
00:18:28.483 --> 00:18:31.570
Luca, look, it's snowing.

211
00:18:31.861 --> 00:18:33.905
- The snow!
- Get up.


212
00:18:34.113 --> 00:18:37.116
Move along or we'll be too late.

213
00:18:38.535 --> 00:18:42.372
The Milanese don't like
their streets with snow.


214
00:18:42.747 --> 00:18:44.666
Hey, sleepyhead, get up!

215
00:18:48.169 --> 00:18:50.297
Look at the snow!

216
00:18:52.799 --> 00:18:55.093
Simone, darling, get up.

217
00:18:55.552 --> 00:18:57.804
It's snowing!
How wonderful!


218
00:18:57.929 --> 00:19:00.389
There should be work
for everybody.


219
00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:04.519
Look, the others are almost ready!

220
00:19:04.853 --> 00:19:07.689
Get up, get up!

221
00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:11.734
- Get a move on, Rocco.
- We're coming.


222
00:19:11.735 --> 00:19:12.861
Simone!

223
00:19:16.615 --> 00:19:18.617
Rocco, you've been sick.

224
00:19:18.992 --> 00:19:23.288
- Wear one of my sweaters.
- But it's a woman's.


225
00:19:25.039 --> 00:19:28.959
Let them tease away. Listen
to your mother. Put it on.


226
00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:31.129
I'll get some breakfast.

227
00:19:32.714 --> 00:19:33.882
Simone!

228
00:19:34.716 --> 00:19:37.677
Come on, Simone,
we're working today.


229
00:19:37.927 --> 00:19:41.556
- Luca!
- Luca, you'll make us late. Quit it!


230
00:19:43.475 --> 00:19:46.353
- Careful not to fall.
- Off you go!


231
00:19:46.936 --> 00:19:50.274
- Hurry, boys!
- Move it, Ciro! Simone!


232
00:19:50.482 --> 00:19:54.110
- The coffee's almost ready.
- Here I am.


233
00:19:54.361 --> 00:19:58.823
Drink the eggs,
they're fresh and healthy!


234
00:20:02.118 --> 00:20:05.872
The coffee's boiling hot.
Put in lots of bread.


235
00:20:06.415 --> 00:20:08.833
Fix some for your brother too.

236
00:20:12.337 --> 00:20:15.714
Oh, thank God,
there's work here for everybody!


237
00:20:15.715 --> 00:20:19.093
The Lord is merciful.
He sent us the snow.


238
00:20:19.261 --> 00:20:21.804
- You wearing my sweater?
- Yes.


239
00:20:21.805 --> 00:20:28.437
Simone, dear, hurry. Come on!

240
00:20:28.645 --> 00:20:32.565
- Poor baby, he has to go to work.
- It's freezing. You even left..


241
00:20:32.566 --> 00:20:36.695
The window open.
I don't get hot flashes.


242
00:20:46.496 --> 00:20:50.166
Come on, the city's waiting
for us, lazybones!


243
00:20:51.209 --> 00:20:54.670
That guy will never change.
Finish your coffee.


244
00:20:54.671 --> 00:20:58.007
I'll get lunch ready.
Luca, my satchel!


245
00:20:58.425 --> 00:21:01.010
- Yes, Mamma.
- No, I'll get it.


246
00:21:04.138 --> 00:21:07.850
- Luca, my satchel!
- It's here, under the bed.


247
00:21:07.851 --> 00:21:14.566
- I'll get it for you.
- Hurry up!


248
00:21:17.569 --> 00:21:21.323
Here are your coats.

249
00:21:21.656 --> 00:21:24.408
Rocco, cover up.
Don't take chances,..


250
00:21:24.409 --> 00:21:26.869
You've been sick.
If you had a chill...


251
00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:30.163
Here, everything's ready.
Come on, hurry!


252
00:21:30.164 --> 00:21:35.504
Hey, lazybones,
I'll help you with your coat.


253
00:21:35.837 --> 00:21:39.048
Cover up, you loafer, you.

254
00:21:42.761 --> 00:21:46.014
God bless this city!
You happy now?!


255
00:21:46.348 --> 00:21:48.350
Rocco, my angel.

256
00:21:50.519 --> 00:21:53.521
- This coffee's boiling hot.
- Come on, Ciro.


257
00:21:53.522 --> 00:21:55.773
Hurry! It's stopped snowing.

258
00:21:55.774 --> 00:21:58.610
There's enough for a day's work.

259
00:21:59.361 --> 00:22:03.072
Don't forget your hats.
Hurry it up!


260
00:22:03.282 --> 00:22:06.410
Dear God, you can't be late!

261
00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:10.497
Hurry, Mamma's kicking us out.

262
00:22:10.705 --> 00:22:12.957
- Be quick!
- Coming, Mamma.


263
00:22:13.166 --> 00:22:16.085
Move, I'm freezing here.

264
00:22:16.795 --> 00:22:18.797
- Give me a kiss.
- Ciao.


265
00:22:19.964 --> 00:22:22.634
Ciao, Rocco, God be with you.

266
00:22:24.553 --> 00:22:26.471
You be careful, Ciro.

267
00:22:26.805 --> 00:22:28.973
Go on, Vincenzo!
Good work!


268
00:22:29.433 --> 00:22:33.686
By all the Saints, if you
don't come back with money..


269
00:22:33.687 --> 00:22:36.897
You're no longer sons
of Rosaria Parondi!


270
00:22:36.898 --> 00:22:39.359
- Ciao, Mamma.
- Good luck!


271
00:22:45.031 --> 00:22:47.158
- Simone!
- Yes?


272
00:22:47.367 --> 00:22:49.785
- Are you coming too?
- Where?


273
00:22:49.786 --> 00:22:52.872
- To the delegation.
- Where's that?


274
00:22:53.081 --> 00:22:54.541
I don't know.

275
00:22:55.083 --> 00:22:57.419
Simone, Rocco, hurry!

276
00:23:37.208 --> 00:23:39.043
- Ciao.
- You see him?


277
00:23:39.253 --> 00:23:41.755
- He's gone now.
- How are you?


278
00:23:42.171 --> 00:23:45.424
- You haven't been around.
- I can explain everything.


279
00:23:45.425 --> 00:23:47.301
- Ciao, Ginetta.
- Ciao.


280
00:23:47.302 --> 00:23:49.971
Let's go where we can talk.

281
00:24:03.610 --> 00:24:06.153
I can't come to your house anymore..

282
00:24:06.154 --> 00:24:09.324
And you're always chaperoned...

283
00:24:09.574 --> 00:24:12.327
Our families are against us.

284
00:24:12.536 --> 00:24:15.120
- What chance do we have?
- I keep hoping.


285
00:24:15.121 --> 00:24:18.332
- You're a born optimist.
- Ciao, Ginetta.


286
00:24:18.333 --> 00:24:20.168
- Ciao.
- We'll manage.


287
00:24:20.377 --> 00:24:24.171
We've got a place now.
And Mamma says one must take...


288
00:24:24.172 --> 00:24:26.924
- Ciao!
..a woman without asking,..


289
00:24:26.925 --> 00:24:30.554
Anyone's permission.
- One what?!


290
00:24:32.597 --> 00:24:33.765
What's wrong?

291
00:24:34.433 --> 00:24:38.770
One takes her, like one
takes a woman, without asking.


292
00:24:39.228 --> 00:24:43.983
With me you have to ask
every time!


293
00:24:44.276 --> 00:24:47.279
- I'll ask.
- Ciao.


294
00:24:55.036 --> 00:24:57.789
You whore!
Miserable bitch!


295
00:24:57.914 --> 00:24:59.791
Shut up! I'm going!

296
00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:13.513
- What's going on?
- Quiet!


297
00:25:19.185 --> 00:25:21.980
It's my father.
We don't get along.


298
00:25:23.565 --> 00:25:25.734
Who are you?
You live here?


299
00:25:25.817 --> 00:25:29.654
Wish I could,
but they don't want me. Hear that?


300
00:25:29.779 --> 00:25:31.155
Why not?

301
00:25:32.449 --> 00:25:34.909
Oh, the same old stupid story:

302
00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:39.706
You know, a girl's honor, etc.

303
00:25:39.914 --> 00:25:44.085
They think it's important.
What's a poor girl to do?


304
00:25:47.256 --> 00:25:53.762
Can you imagine if all girls like me
suddenly disappeared? Just think...


305
00:25:55.555 --> 00:25:58.767
Yeah...
There'd only be us men left.


306
00:25:59.768 --> 00:26:01.895
- To do what?
- Quiet!


307
00:26:05.524 --> 00:26:08.192
- Hear that?
- What'll you do?


308
00:26:08.735 --> 00:26:10.529
Go away. What else?

309
00:26:12.113 --> 00:26:13.113
Wait.

310
00:26:15.659 --> 00:26:17.785
Come inside.
Maybe my mother..


311
00:26:17.786 --> 00:26:20.830
Has something warm
for you to wear..


312
00:26:21.998 --> 00:26:23.041
You're sweet.

313
00:26:26.461 --> 00:26:27.837
I'm what?

314
00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:29.548
You're sweet.

315
00:26:31.132 --> 00:26:32.342
Let's go.

316
00:26:40.434 --> 00:26:42.436
- How far?
- Right there.


317
00:26:47.231 --> 00:26:48.231
Come in.

318
00:26:49.318 --> 00:26:52.070
- That's you, Vincenzo?
- Yes, Ma.


319
00:26:52.236 --> 00:26:54.739
Were they shouting at you?

320
00:26:54.989 --> 00:26:56.366
No, not me,..

321
00:26:57.534 --> 00:27:01.162
At this poor girl here
who's got a problem.


322
00:27:02.121 --> 00:27:06.084
Do you have something
she can cover up with?


323
00:27:07.669 --> 00:27:09.754
- A girl?
- Yes, Ma.


324
00:27:12.674 --> 00:27:15.009
- Where is she?
- Here, look.


325
00:27:16.636 --> 00:27:21.766
- Sorry, if I'm disturbing you.
- Close the door, it's freezing.


326
00:27:23.602 --> 00:27:27.356
Come in. I don't know
what I can give her.


327
00:27:27.647 --> 00:27:30.149
There's your father's old coat.

328
00:27:30.233 --> 00:27:33.194
Whatever, but hurry,
she's shivering.


329
00:27:33.236 --> 00:27:34.779
Let's see.

330
00:27:37.282 --> 00:27:38.282
Evening.

331
00:27:39.033 --> 00:27:40.076
Good evening.

332
00:27:42.203 --> 00:27:43.247
Good evening.

333
00:27:46.416 --> 00:27:47.959
Your brothers, huh?

334
00:27:50.587 --> 00:27:52.506
Yes, we're all brothers.

335
00:27:59.679 --> 00:28:01.848
It's much colder down here.

336
00:28:04.559 --> 00:28:05.852
You're Milanese?

337
00:28:07.354 --> 00:28:10.231
Nearby. From Cremona,
to be exact,..


338
00:28:11.275 --> 00:28:13.277
Like the pickled fruit!

339
00:28:19.574 --> 00:28:21.451
Southerners, huh?

340
00:28:24.037 --> 00:28:25.163
You work here?

341
00:28:26.373 --> 00:28:28.207
Today we shoveled snow.

342
00:28:28.292 --> 00:28:29.334
Good for you!

343
00:28:31.169 --> 00:28:34.298
He brought us.
We've been here a month.


344
00:28:35.382 --> 00:28:37.175
Work's hard to find.

345
00:28:38.635 --> 00:28:42.180
That's why we shoveled snow
today. Sit down.


346
00:28:42.681 --> 00:28:47.727
Big boys like you find work
immediately, if that's..


347
00:28:48.102 --> 00:28:49.479
What you want.

348
00:28:50.397 --> 00:28:51.773
Your family?

349
00:28:52.106 --> 00:28:54.192
Yeah, I'm in the middle.

350
00:28:54.443 --> 00:28:57.654
So you're in the middle.
And that's you?


351
00:28:58.697 --> 00:29:00.698
- This one is...
- He's Rocco.


352
00:29:00.699 --> 00:29:04.201
- Which one is Rocco?
- It's him. - Yes, it's him.


353
00:29:04.202 --> 00:29:06.204
And that's the other one.

354
00:29:06.246 --> 00:29:08.415
And who's the boxer here?

355
00:29:11.293 --> 00:29:12.502
Vincenzo.

356
00:29:12.752 --> 00:29:14.713
Who's Vincenzo?

357
00:29:15.672 --> 00:29:18.508
But he's got no feel for it.

358
00:29:18.675 --> 00:29:19.675
Why not?

359
00:29:20.510 --> 00:29:23.096
It's a shame. I know a champion.

360
00:29:24.348 --> 00:29:26.808
He was just a nobody.

361
00:29:27.016 --> 00:29:30.437
And now he's rich,
made piles of money!


362
00:29:30.729 --> 00:29:36.693
I swear he drives a car
as long as a bus.


363
00:29:38.862 --> 00:29:41.030
Better than shoveling snow!

364
00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:43.283
You see!

365
00:29:44.618 --> 00:29:48.288
He's against our trying out.

366
00:29:48.788 --> 00:29:51.625
- What's there to lose?
- No?


367
00:29:52.626 --> 00:29:53.668
You're right.

368
00:29:55.086 --> 00:29:58.089
If you're so convinced,
then do it!


369
00:29:58.382 --> 00:30:02.217
You don't need his permission.
You heard what she said.


370
00:30:02.218 --> 00:30:06.222
Baloney! My great career's
already come to an end.


371
00:30:07.307 --> 00:30:10.477
If you're lucky,
they pay your lunch.


372
00:30:10.894 --> 00:30:13.062
Because you're not a champ.

373
00:30:13.187 --> 00:30:15.690
You don't become one overnight.

374
00:30:15.732 --> 00:30:18.985
Maybe Simone and Rocco just might.

375
00:30:19.278 --> 00:30:21.446
They're stronger than you.

376
00:30:21.655 --> 00:30:24.948
They'll still end up
with cauliflower ears.


377
00:30:24.949 --> 00:30:28.952
The guy capable of knocking
Simone out hasn't even been born yet.


378
00:30:28.953 --> 00:30:31.623
Mamma's right, 
Simone's stronger.

379
00:30:31.831 --> 00:30:34.918
I almost forgot,
here, put this on.


380
00:30:35.335 --> 00:30:37.921
I couldn't find anything better.

381
00:30:42.008 --> 00:30:43.260
Thank you.

382
00:30:43.843 --> 00:30:46.095
I'll bring it back tomorrow.

383
00:30:46.471 --> 00:30:48.682
Wait, it's my friend,..

384
00:30:48.890 --> 00:30:51.224
The Sergeant who lives
in this building.


385
00:30:51.225 --> 00:30:53.143
- Good evening.
- Good evening.


386
00:30:53.144 --> 00:30:55.479
- Could you accompany her?
- Yes.


387
00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:58.023
She had a bad fight
with her father.


388
00:30:58.024 --> 00:31:01.486
- You can change in the bathroom.
- Thanks.


389
00:31:04.113 --> 00:31:06.157
She's all we needed!

390
00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:09.369
Come here, and close that door!

391
00:31:12.872 --> 00:31:15.708
What's got into you?
Bringing her here!


392
00:31:15.709 --> 00:31:18.794
You know her?
She could even be a whore.


393
00:31:18.795 --> 00:31:21.298
- She's beautiful.
- Beautiful?


394
00:31:21.631 --> 00:31:24.216
She had goose pimples,
the weakling.


395
00:31:24.217 --> 00:31:26.803
Learn how to look at women.

396
00:31:28.472 --> 00:31:30.681
She had goose pimples
because she was cold.


397
00:31:30.682 --> 00:31:34.143
No, she's anaemic,
she's got Northern skin.


398
00:31:42.777 --> 00:31:43.862
She's gone.

399
00:31:45.655 --> 00:31:47.282
And my coat?

400
00:31:48.367 --> 00:31:50.619
She went out the window.

401
00:31:51.286 --> 00:31:53.372
Gone? Run off?
A thief!


402
00:31:55.499 --> 00:31:56.666
Her dress.

403
00:31:57.208 --> 00:31:58.585
You're kidding...

404
00:32:01.045 --> 00:32:04.258
I'm sorry,
I bothered you for nothing.


405
00:32:04.716 --> 00:32:06.759
That's all right,
don't worry about it.


406
00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:09.095
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.


407
00:32:10.555 --> 00:32:12.349
Disappointed?

408
00:32:12.849 --> 00:32:14.393
I don't care.

409
00:32:14.768 --> 00:32:18.772
You worry about yourself.
And clean those lentils.


410
00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:24.528
You see, Ginetta is not
the only girl in the world.


411
00:32:24.569 --> 00:32:28.197
Time to eat, boys.
The soup's ready. Come on!


412
00:32:33.119 --> 00:32:35.121
Rocco, come and eat.

413
00:32:56.851 --> 00:33:04.851
♪ Maria Donata,
what beautiful flower is this!♪.


414
00:33:07.028 --> 00:33:10.782
♪ Let me give it a kiss. ♪

415
00:33:11.074 --> 00:33:14.994

your nose. ♪


416
00:33:17.872 --> 00:33:21.793
♪ My love's a rose, a rose. ♪

417
00:33:23.308 --> 00:33:24.308
Turn round.

418
00:33:25.394 --> 00:33:26.394
Your right!

419
00:33:28.104 --> 00:33:29.104
Hold it!

420
00:33:29.439 --> 00:33:31.316
Lift that right!

421
00:33:34.861 --> 00:33:39.032
- Merli, hold on, I'll come back.
- What's going on?


422
00:33:45.455 --> 00:33:48.833
- What are you doing here?
- Just looking.


423
00:33:49.334 --> 00:33:53.463
Sorry, they're my brothers.
It wasn't my idea.


424
00:33:53.755 --> 00:33:56.049
Colli, have them change!

425
00:33:56.258 --> 00:34:00.053
Parondi, get your ass back here.

426
00:34:02.597 --> 00:34:05.141
You heard him?
Move it!


427
00:34:06.268 --> 00:34:08.603
Well?
What are you doing?


428
00:34:09.896 --> 00:34:11.690
Need an invitation?

429
00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:18.236
- Wait a minute, you.
- You calling me?


430
00:34:18.237 --> 00:34:21.074
Yeah, you with that cigarette.

431
00:34:21.950 --> 00:34:24.536
Put some trunks on.
Hurry it up!


432
00:34:27.831 --> 00:34:32.377
These hicks...
They wanna box and smoke too.


433
00:34:37.048 --> 00:34:38.342
Get changed.

434
00:34:43.388 --> 00:34:45.222
- Where are you from?
- Lucania.


435
00:34:45.223 --> 00:34:48.225
- Where's that?
- Oh, it's a long way from here.


436
00:34:48.226 --> 00:34:51.229
- You came up here to box?
- Why not?


437
00:34:51.396 --> 00:34:53.815
- It's tough!
- We can try.


438
00:35:02.491 --> 00:35:03.950
Quiet!

439
00:35:12.125 --> 00:35:13.209
Vincenzo!

440
00:35:17.714 --> 00:35:18.840
Vincenzo!

441
00:35:31.770 --> 00:35:33.146
Vincenzo!

442
00:35:46.451 --> 00:35:51.456
- Vincenzo, where are you?
- I'm up here.


443
00:35:51.956 --> 00:35:56.628
- They've come to evict us!
- At last!


444
00:35:57.504 --> 00:36:00.631
Ma doesn't know what to do.
You coming?


445
00:36:00.632 --> 00:36:01.675
I can't.

446
00:36:02.634 --> 00:36:06.638
Tell Mamma the City Hall
will give us a place now.


447
00:36:08.723 --> 00:36:12.769
She needn't worry.
Do like I said, go on!


448
00:36:14.604 --> 00:36:16.064
Jab, again!

449
00:36:17.649 --> 00:36:19.734
Jab! Again!
Jab! Jab! Jab!


450
00:36:20.819 --> 00:36:22.987
Where you going? Come here!

451
00:36:24.323 --> 00:36:26.991
Jab! Jab!

452
00:36:27.951 --> 00:36:31.246
Come here! Jab! Jab!

453
00:36:32.414 --> 00:36:37.252
Jab! Jab!

454
00:36:47.387 --> 00:36:49.723
Ciao, Duilio, how's it going?

455
00:36:54.436 --> 00:36:57.356
Fine, fine. He's new?

456
00:36:57.689 --> 00:37:00.359
3 months.
He's slow, but solid.


457
00:37:00.984 --> 00:37:03.570
- Go take your shower.
- Okay.


458
00:37:07.366 --> 00:37:08.366
Hey!

459
00:37:16.207 --> 00:37:17.207
Not bad.

460
00:37:21.255 --> 00:37:23.673
Good horse teeth, but stained.

461
00:37:24.215 --> 00:37:27.511
Cut out the cigarettes,
if you wanna box.


462
00:37:27.636 --> 00:37:31.806
No offense, but if he stays
here, he'll get nowhere.


463
00:37:37.228 --> 00:37:38.772
Got a minute?

464
00:37:41.065 --> 00:37:44.486
Don't start taking
my best recruits now.


465
00:37:49.616 --> 00:37:52.952
You'll see,
you'll be going with him.


466
00:37:53.119 --> 00:37:56.415
"Cerri's Gym",
where the champs work out.


467
00:37:58.542 --> 00:38:02.504
Let's hope they release me.
But if they don't,..


468
00:38:03.630 --> 00:38:05.089
I'll go anyway.

469
00:38:09.052 --> 00:38:11.346
They think I got the goods.

470
00:38:12.306 --> 00:38:14.558
They never wanted Vincenzo.

471
00:38:16.601 --> 00:38:17.811
What about you?

472
00:38:18.186 --> 00:38:21.105
I guess I don't have the goods.

473
00:38:23.149 --> 00:38:25.985
Wait up, I'm gonna shower too.

474
00:39:16.495 --> 00:39:17.495
Age?

475
00:39:18.913 --> 00:39:19.913
Twenty one.

476
00:39:20.749 --> 00:39:22.125
Military service?

477
00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:26.296
I'm 4-F,
because of an accident.


478
00:39:26.546 --> 00:39:30.008
We'll get round that.
You willing to work?


479
00:39:30.759 --> 00:39:31.926
To work?

480
00:39:32.594 --> 00:39:34.429
In a gym. To get..

481
00:39:35.722 --> 00:39:37.098
Into shape.

482
00:39:39.268 --> 00:39:42.854
We're forming a stable
of newcomers.


483
00:39:43.980 --> 00:39:46.275
You're not that young,..

484
00:39:46.775 --> 00:39:49.068
But we'll see.

485
00:39:54.699 --> 00:39:57.452
Coke!
Beer! "Chinotto"!


486
00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:03.250
Throw him out!

487
00:40:04.668 --> 00:40:05.668
Go! Scram!

488
00:40:06.753 --> 00:40:10.590
A light heavyweight
three-round match. Between..


489
00:40:11.550 --> 00:40:15.094
Parondi, representing Milan,..

490
00:40:15.762 --> 00:40:18.473
Sponsored by the Aurora Club...

491
00:40:23.728 --> 00:40:26.064
- I'm leaving!
- Sit down!


492
00:40:26.315 --> 00:40:30.277
- Let me go!
- Parondi, traitor!


493
00:40:30.527 --> 00:40:33.946
- They're razzing me.
- Just worry about Simone.


494
00:40:33.947 --> 00:40:36.115
They're Ginetta's brothers.

495
00:40:36.408 --> 00:40:41.830
And Vitolo,
representing Virtus Club, Lucania.


496
00:40:42.247 --> 00:40:44.833
Go, Vitolo, teach him a lesson!

497
00:40:45.041 --> 00:40:46.041
Quiet.

498
00:40:46.668 --> 00:40:49.086
The Parondis are all traitors!

499
00:40:49.087 --> 00:40:52.173
Ferri, from Genoa.

500
00:40:58.805 --> 00:41:01.266
Seconds out.

501
00:41:08.106 --> 00:41:10.233
First Round.

502
00:41:27.626 --> 00:41:30.629
Parondi!
Parondi!


503
00:41:51.608 --> 00:41:53.943
Go, Simone, go!

504
00:42:08.082 --> 00:42:10.209
- Bluff!
- Cut it out!


505
00:42:10.419 --> 00:42:11.461
Phoney!

506
00:42:37.236 --> 00:42:41.533
By a knockout..

507
00:42:41.825 --> 00:42:46.955
In the first round,
the winner is Simone Parondi.


508
00:42:57.382 --> 00:42:58.592
May I?

509
00:42:58.842 --> 00:43:02.637
Hello, everybody!

510
00:43:03.638 --> 00:43:06.057
Good, very good!
What's this?


511
00:43:07.559 --> 00:43:10.937
Nothing.
Anyway... he didn't go the limit.


512
00:43:11.771 --> 00:43:16.192
Isn't he modest? "Didn't go the limit"!
You're a champ!


513
00:43:18.445 --> 00:43:22.991
Purple, the color
of champions and showgirls.


514
00:43:26.370 --> 00:43:29.914
I'll train him myself.
I know what he needs.


515
00:43:31.124 --> 00:43:33.960
We'll eat out tonight
to celebrate.


516
00:43:34.336 --> 00:43:36.587
I'll be waiting in my car.
Right?


517
00:43:36.588 --> 00:43:38.422
- Sure, thanks.
- Ciao.


518
00:43:38.423 --> 00:43:39.466
Good evening.

519
00:43:39.758 --> 00:43:40.758
Simone!

520
00:43:42.093 --> 00:43:44.678
- There's a fight going on outside!
- A fight?


521
00:43:44.679 --> 00:43:47.724
- Yeah! - But where?
- Come on! Quick!


522
00:43:50.018 --> 00:43:53.187
Trai-tor! Trai-tor!

523
00:44:07.452 --> 00:44:08.537
Cowards!

524
00:44:10.038 --> 00:44:11.331
Cowards!

525
00:44:19.213 --> 00:44:20.507
Come away.

526
00:44:20.715 --> 00:44:22.175
Move!

527
00:44:33.186 --> 00:44:36.523
- Move!
- Vincenzo!


528
00:44:37.899 --> 00:44:40.735
- Let me go!
- Come away!


529
00:44:42.446 --> 00:44:45.238
Alfredo, wait!
We have a score to settle.


530
00:44:45.239 --> 00:44:47.658
I've already settled everything.

531
00:44:47.659 --> 00:44:49.368
I'll be the one to settle it.

532
00:44:49.369 --> 00:44:52.913
- Wait! I'll handle this!
- Shut up, and go home!


533
00:44:52.914 --> 00:44:55.124
- Move!
- Ginetta!


534
00:44:56.251 --> 00:44:59.504
I said go home!

535
00:45:05.009 --> 00:45:07.596
- Leave me alone!
- Ciro!


536
00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:14.728
Trai-tor! Trai-tor!

537
00:45:32.912 --> 00:45:34.122
Remember me?

538
00:45:34.498 --> 00:45:36.040
Of course.

539
00:45:37.709 --> 00:45:38.709
Well?

540
00:45:39.294 --> 00:45:41.671
- You coming?
- I'm coming.


541
00:46:13.161 --> 00:46:15.204
So you decided to box.

542
00:46:19.626 --> 00:46:21.420
A good idea. Yeah!

543
00:46:28.718 --> 00:46:31.054
It's a nice profession.

544
00:46:33.056 --> 00:46:34.056
Taste good?

545
00:46:38.562 --> 00:46:41.398
If I'm not mistaken, you box..

546
00:46:42.816 --> 00:46:44.609
The way I put out.

547
00:46:46.653 --> 00:46:47.862
For money.

548
00:46:49.155 --> 00:46:51.241
No, I box with feeling.

549
00:46:51.700 --> 00:46:52.992
With feeling?

550
00:46:53.535 --> 00:46:57.414
Yeah, well,
I work with feeling too!


551
00:47:04.838 --> 00:47:06.214
And your brother?

552
00:47:07.507 --> 00:47:08.507
Which one?

553
00:47:10.051 --> 00:47:13.847
The oldest. The one
who called the police.


554
00:47:16.725 --> 00:47:17.851
What a day!

555
00:47:18.602 --> 00:47:21.355
First it snowed, then my father,..

556
00:47:23.398 --> 00:47:25.734
Then running away...

557
00:47:26.693 --> 00:47:29.613
I never could stand the police.

558
00:47:29.779 --> 00:47:32.616
Even as a kid.
You can imagine now!


559
00:47:40.915 --> 00:47:42.041
I'm tired.

560
00:47:43.335 --> 00:47:45.461
I'll sleep and you'll disappear.

561
00:47:45.462 --> 00:47:47.213
- No.
- Yes, you will.


562
00:47:48.548 --> 00:47:50.800
Because I'm telling you to.

563
00:47:52.511 --> 00:47:54.263
I like sleeping alone.

564
00:47:55.847 --> 00:47:57.682
That's why I left home.

565
00:47:59.726 --> 00:48:02.145
When I was little, my father..

566
00:48:03.146 --> 00:48:06.024
Took sick,
and was hospitalized,..


567
00:48:06.275 --> 00:48:09.486
And we ended up
staying with an uncle.


568
00:48:11.112 --> 00:48:14.449
After the war,
houses were hard to find.


569
00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:20.038
I remember we were
all together,..


570
00:48:21.748 --> 00:48:23.500
Crammed in one room.

571
00:48:24.125 --> 00:48:25.502
Like your house.

572
00:48:28.004 --> 00:48:31.383
On summer mornings,
once school let out,..


573
00:48:32.717 --> 00:48:35.053
We'd play in the courtyard.

574
00:48:35.845 --> 00:48:38.181
I was big for my age..

575
00:48:39.223 --> 00:48:41.643
And didn't like kids' games.

576
00:48:43.061 --> 00:48:44.688
So I'd just watch.

577
00:48:47.482 --> 00:48:51.110
The dentist from the ground floor..

578
00:48:53.988 --> 00:48:55.990
Beckoned to me.

579
00:48:57.826 --> 00:49:01.120
After that,
I started going there nights.


580
00:49:03.122 --> 00:49:04.833
A great improvement.

581
00:49:05.584 --> 00:49:08.086
Now we were only two in a bed.

582
00:49:09.421 --> 00:49:12.882
- How old were you?
- 13.


583
00:49:15.009 --> 00:49:18.763
It's not true, it's not true
about the dentist.


584
00:49:19.723 --> 00:49:21.808
I was happy as a child.

585
00:49:24.227 --> 00:49:26.563
The trouble started later on.

586
00:49:30.066 --> 00:49:31.860
Please, I'm so tired.

587
00:49:32.902 --> 00:49:35.447
I already told you, go!

588
00:49:38.283 --> 00:49:39.409
What is it?

589
00:49:40.660 --> 00:49:41.703
Again?

590
00:50:00.096 --> 00:50:03.683
I'm over here!

591
00:50:04.393 --> 00:50:06.185
Coming!

592
00:50:13.693 --> 00:50:15.779
- Well?
- Here...


593
00:50:19.866 --> 00:50:22.994
These are the notices
for night school.


594
00:50:23.036 --> 00:50:25.038
They were free,..

595
00:50:25.247 --> 00:50:28.123
But you need an elementary
school certificate.


596
00:50:28.124 --> 00:50:29.501
I have one.

597
00:50:29.793 --> 00:50:31.711
- Here!
- What's that?


598
00:50:36.049 --> 00:50:37.967
Stop wasting your money!

599
00:50:38.092 --> 00:50:40.262
Simone gave it to me.

600
00:50:41.095 --> 00:50:43.932
Ah, Simone!
Did he go to work?


601
00:50:44.599 --> 00:50:46.935
He was sleeping when I left.

602
00:50:47.352 --> 00:50:49.646
He never works mornings.

603
00:50:49.854 --> 00:50:52.816
Yeah, and who knows
what he works at?


604
00:50:53.232 --> 00:50:57.404
Something good! He gave
Mamma 2,000 liras yesterday.


605
00:50:57.821 --> 00:50:59.614
And what're you doing?

606
00:50:59.823 --> 00:51:03.743
I'm a delivery boy for the grocer
near our house.


607
00:51:05.870 --> 00:51:09.458
As soon as I turn twenty,
I'll show you all!


608
00:51:10.250 --> 00:51:12.043
- Ciao.
- Ciao.


609
00:51:24.389 --> 00:51:27.100
Are you sure you know
how to read?


610
00:51:28.059 --> 00:51:31.896
Everything's such a mess
since you've been here.


611
00:51:32.272 --> 00:51:34.898
- It's not this one.
- It is. Look!


612
00:51:34.899 --> 00:51:36.984
- No.
- That's not true,..


613
00:51:36.985 --> 00:51:40.447
It's always been a mess.
- No, it hasn't.


614
00:51:40.530 --> 00:51:43.492
Give me the receipts,
and I'll check.


615
00:51:43.658 --> 00:51:47.287
- They're all scrambled up.
- Now, let's see.


616
00:51:47.787 --> 00:51:50.248
The boss said
she's got a headache.


617
00:51:50.249 --> 00:51:52.833
She probably didn't sleep
last night, poor thing.


618
00:51:52.834 --> 00:51:58.172
Can't you remember his name?
Try, at least.


619
00:51:58.382 --> 00:52:00.842
He's only been here a month.

620
00:52:01.092 --> 00:52:04.554
A year wouldn't be enough
time, huh, Rocco?


621
00:52:04.929 --> 00:52:06.681
Our "Sleeping Beauty"!

622
00:52:06.765 --> 00:52:10.269
Ida, give him a kiss,
that might wake him.


623
00:52:10.519 --> 00:52:12.771
My boyfriend would kill me.

624
00:52:13.187 --> 00:52:14.273
I'll do it.

625
00:52:20.487 --> 00:52:22.030
Oooh, a customer!

626
00:52:22.196 --> 00:52:25.700
- Hello? Signora Ubaldi?
- Who's he?


627
00:52:25.950 --> 00:52:27.160
My brother.

628
00:52:27.869 --> 00:52:29.953
Tell him to come round
the back or clear off.


629
00:52:29.954 --> 00:52:32.873
The boss doesn't want
relatives visiting in the shop.


630
00:52:32.874 --> 00:52:36.084
- Good morning, you girls.
- Good morning.


631
00:52:36.085 --> 00:52:39.548
Just what I need!

632
00:52:42.426 --> 00:52:46.930
You never said
it was such a nice place.


633
00:52:47.931 --> 00:52:49.932
You hang your clothes
there, and...


634
00:52:49.933 --> 00:52:53.019
Can't you read?
You come in, undress..


635
00:52:53.562 --> 00:52:55.605
And go out brand new.

636
00:52:55.855 --> 00:52:57.607
Exactly what I wanted!

637
00:52:57.816 --> 00:52:59.232
How fast can you do it?

638
00:52:59.233 --> 00:53:01.361
It's expensive.

639
00:53:01.611 --> 00:53:02.737
So who cares?!

640
00:53:05.740 --> 00:53:07.033
What's going on?

641
00:53:09.828 --> 00:53:13.332
They said they'd make me
over in 5 minutes.


642
00:53:14.416 --> 00:53:16.543
- You want proof?
- Yes.


643
00:53:17.001 --> 00:53:20.504
- In the booth. Giannini, take care of him.
- Thanks.


644
00:53:20.505 --> 00:53:23.674
- Rocco, you're still here?
- It's his brother.


645
00:53:23.675 --> 00:53:25.719
Show her the package.

646
00:53:27.053 --> 00:53:29.097
There's no receipt.

647
00:53:29.306 --> 00:53:31.599
It belongs to your relative...
what's-her-name...


648
00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:33.435
It's Signora Brighetti!

649
00:53:34.811 --> 00:53:36.480
Here are my trousers.

650
00:53:39.274 --> 00:53:41.360
And wait, here's my shirt.

651
00:53:42.736 --> 00:53:44.654
- Ma'am!
- Yes?


652
00:53:46.573 --> 00:53:48.242
Can we do this shirt?

653
00:53:50.244 --> 00:53:51.703
No, not the shirt.

654
00:53:53.079 --> 00:53:55.706
- It's too frayed.
- What a shame...


655
00:53:55.707 --> 00:53:58.209
- Then what'll I do?
- I can't.


656
00:53:58.710 --> 00:54:01.212
Let me see what we can do here.

657
00:54:01.755 --> 00:54:04.841
Rocco, hurry!
You'll be late.


658
00:54:05.049 --> 00:54:06.260
Come here.

659
00:54:07.261 --> 00:54:08.803
We gotta talk.

660
00:54:09.804 --> 00:54:11.890
The rest was just for fun.

661
00:54:12.557 --> 00:54:14.225
Pardon us, my friend.

662
00:54:15.226 --> 00:54:18.480
Rocco! I got something
important going.


663
00:54:20.357 --> 00:54:22.025
Did you get paid yet?

664
00:54:24.611 --> 00:54:27.531
- Tonight.
- I need the money now.


665
00:54:28.031 --> 00:54:32.160
Tell them at the gym.
I'll be gone 2 days.


666
00:54:32.786 --> 00:54:35.288
Rocco, don't lend him anything.

667
00:54:35.289 --> 00:54:37.291
I thought you liked me.

668
00:54:37.541 --> 00:54:41.586
I'm protecting Rocco,
he should be wary of you.


669
00:54:42.546 --> 00:54:44.798
- You'll do it?
- Sure.


670
00:54:47.133 --> 00:54:49.177
What should I give him?

671
00:54:49.803 --> 00:54:51.513
Half a month's wages?

672
00:54:53.097 --> 00:54:56.016
- Yes, Signora.
- After taxes, that is.


673
00:54:56.017 --> 00:54:57.602
- Of course.
- Fine.


674
00:55:01.022 --> 00:55:03.942
- Does Mamma know?
- She knows.


675
00:55:04.318 --> 00:55:05.527
- Ciao.
- Ciao.


676
00:55:07.529 --> 00:55:09.155
Rocco, come here.

677
00:55:25.004 --> 00:55:27.507
Your trousers are almost ready.

678
00:55:27.674 --> 00:55:31.511
May I have the jacket?
Just a couple of minutes.


679
00:55:32.178 --> 00:55:34.013
- Ah... here.
- Thanks.


680
00:55:35.599 --> 00:55:37.309
Sign this.

681
00:55:37.851 --> 00:55:40.770
The trousers!

682
00:55:43.732 --> 00:55:46.901
- That was fast.
- I told you so.


683
00:55:47.068 --> 00:55:48.278
- Ciao.
- Ciao.


684
00:55:48.487 --> 00:55:51.865
Here's the coffee
and aspirin you ordered.


685
00:55:53.992 --> 00:55:56.159
I feel like I'm brand new.
Thanks.


686
00:55:56.160 --> 00:55:58.413
Drop in again, sir. Goodbye.

687
00:55:58.788 --> 00:56:01.750
- Here I am.
- Look at him, will you!


688
00:56:02.501 --> 00:56:04.586
You could use a new shirt.

689
00:56:05.169 --> 00:56:06.380
Like those.

690
00:56:07.256 --> 00:56:09.591
They're Dr. Fossati's shirts!

691
00:56:10.008 --> 00:56:13.177
They'd look better
on someone like you.


692
00:56:13.970 --> 00:56:17.724
But that's life:
Luxuries always come too late.


693
00:56:19.183 --> 00:56:22.646
Your brother's 5,000 liras.
You owe me 700.


694
00:56:23.605 --> 00:56:26.441
Don't have it.
Rocco will pay you.


695
00:56:28.360 --> 00:56:31.029
Ma'am, good day and many thanks.

696
00:56:31.321 --> 00:56:34.699
- Good day!
- See you soon!


697
00:56:38.328 --> 00:56:40.455
Well?

698
00:56:41.205 --> 00:56:44.208
No, please... my head!

699
00:56:45.126 --> 00:56:46.836
Go on! Faster!

700
00:56:47.712 --> 00:56:49.298
Close the door, boy.

701
00:56:51.508 --> 00:56:55.304
Did you hear me?
What do you want?


702
00:56:58.682 --> 00:56:59.682
Well?

703
00:57:00.016 --> 00:57:03.853
My brother, Simone, is sick.
He won't be coming.


704
00:57:04.062 --> 00:57:05.355
Great!

705
00:57:05.814 --> 00:57:09.943
Sick? They saw him in town.

706
00:57:11.403 --> 00:57:12.903
I wouldn't know about that.

707
00:57:12.904 --> 00:57:15.407
There's a draft, come in!

708
00:57:15.699 --> 00:57:18.868
You know nothing,
but I'm on to him.


709
00:57:24.082 --> 00:57:26.292
You're his brother?
Then listen.


710
00:57:26.293 --> 00:57:30.046
Instead of helping him,
I should have hung him.


711
00:57:31.005 --> 00:57:32.005
That's it!

712
00:57:32.257 --> 00:57:34.675
That's enough, all of you...
Clear out!


713
00:57:34.676 --> 00:57:39.681
I shouldn't have
brought him here.


714
00:57:40.265 --> 00:57:44.018
I admit it: My mistake.
Never again!


715
00:57:47.897 --> 00:57:49.608
That's it for today.

716
00:57:54.988 --> 00:57:58.283
- So you're Simone's brother, huh?
- Yes.


717
00:57:58.408 --> 00:58:02.161
Your brother's got a nice
build, a good punch..


718
00:58:02.412 --> 00:58:07.000
But he's slow. He should
work out more than the others.


719
00:58:08.918 --> 00:58:11.170
My office.

720
00:58:12.839 --> 00:58:15.925
They trained with me,
fine boxers.


721
00:58:16.301 --> 00:58:17.344
Thanks to me.

722
00:58:20.972 --> 00:58:22.181
Close the door.

723
00:58:26.060 --> 00:58:28.813
Want to help
before it's too late?


724
00:58:30.732 --> 00:58:34.653
Come to the gym together,
you and him.


725
00:58:35.194 --> 00:58:37.406
- Me?
- Yeah.


726
00:58:38.114 --> 00:58:41.868
Stay with him, never let him
out of your sight.


727
00:58:43.077 --> 00:58:45.079
- Your name?
- Rocco.


728
00:58:45.914 --> 00:58:49.166
Like Rocco Mazzola.
From Lucania, like you!


729
00:58:49.167 --> 00:58:50.960
You're a good kid.

730
00:58:51.127 --> 00:58:55.715
It won't cost you anything,
just look after your brother.


731
00:58:56.049 --> 00:59:01.263
And stop him from hanging out
with certain people.


732
00:59:02.597 --> 00:59:04.683
Boxing's a serious thing..

733
00:59:04.766 --> 00:59:08.603
You've gotta lead
a clean life. Like them.


734
00:59:09.646 --> 00:59:13.607
Good morals are the first
requisite of an athlete.


735
00:59:13.608 --> 00:59:17.654
Meaning that... women,
cigarettes, drinking..


736
00:59:19.864 --> 00:59:22.992
And many other things are taboo.

737
00:59:23.952 --> 00:59:25.329
Absolutely taboo.

738
00:59:25.912 --> 00:59:27.831
Look at that motor-boat.

739
00:59:30.750 --> 00:59:32.210
Let's go, come on!

740
00:59:34.212 --> 00:59:37.131
- 'Bye, now.
- Happy Easter.


741
00:59:44.806 --> 00:59:46.099
What's that?

742
00:59:46.308 --> 00:59:50.437
A hotel, first class, sweetie!

743
00:59:50.937 --> 00:59:53.106
- Can we see it?
- Why not?


744
00:59:54.316 --> 00:59:56.817
It's called "The Great Britain".

745
00:59:56.818 --> 01:00:00.655
English tourists used
to crowd here to Bellagio.


746
01:00:00.822 --> 01:00:04.033
People are here now
because it's Easter.


747
01:00:04.075 --> 01:00:07.621
It's got 200, 250 rooms...

748
01:00:08.079 --> 01:00:10.832
- See you around.
- 'Bye, now.


749
01:00:10.999 --> 01:00:12.251
A garden!

750
01:00:12.459 --> 01:00:16.004
And it's fabulous.
You should see it inside.


751
01:00:16.921 --> 01:00:18.715
I was in there once.

752
01:00:18.923 --> 01:00:22.301
- You were in it?
- Inside! It's fantastic!


753
01:00:22.302 --> 01:00:26.848
You should see the rooms,
not like our pension.


754
01:00:30.310 --> 01:00:32.562
The place is super, really.

755
01:00:33.397 --> 01:00:34.939
So are the prices.

756
01:00:36.900 --> 01:00:40.028
- Know what they ask? For a room?
- No.


757
01:00:41.029 --> 01:00:44.032
10,000 liras, just for the room.

758
01:00:46.410 --> 01:00:48.036
10 times 30...

759
01:00:50.622 --> 01:00:53.541
300,000 liras a month
just for a room?


760
01:00:53.542 --> 01:00:54.584
That's a lot!

761
01:00:55.502 --> 01:00:58.129
They're crazy.
How's it possible?


762
01:00:59.005 --> 01:01:02.008
Anyway,
very soon we'll come here.


763
01:01:03.593 --> 01:01:05.219
Want to bet?

764
01:01:05.429 --> 01:01:07.556
When I turn professional.

765
01:01:07.931 --> 01:01:11.435
- Got a cigarette?
- What a place! Gee!


766
01:01:13.812 --> 01:01:16.021
- Want one?
- Oh, no, no. I shouldn't.


767
01:01:16.022 --> 01:01:17.274
The boxer!

768
01:01:25.449 --> 01:01:26.658
I'll keep them.

769
01:01:27.075 --> 01:01:28.452
What'll you earn?

770
01:01:29.994 --> 01:01:33.332
Plenty.
But I gotta train hard.


771
01:01:34.666 --> 01:01:37.669
It'll be a sacrifice.
For you too.


772
01:01:38.503 --> 01:01:39.879
Why for me?

773
01:01:40.505 --> 01:01:44.008
When you're in training,
you can't...


774
01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:50.181
Let's get something straight.
We're not married.


775
01:01:51.475 --> 01:01:53.518
We just go out sometimes.

776
01:01:54.728 --> 01:01:57.731
We may not go out
for another year.


777
01:01:59.023 --> 01:02:00.859
But now we're together.

778
01:02:02.861 --> 01:02:05.405
I needed a change of air.

779
01:02:05.947 --> 01:02:08.992
Without attracting
too much attention.


780
01:02:09.868 --> 01:02:12.912
After each affair,
a nice clean break.


781
01:02:13.372 --> 01:02:14.372
Scram!

782
01:02:15.457 --> 01:02:16.708
You get me?

783
01:02:20.462 --> 01:02:23.548
- Miss!
- Are you talking to me?


784
01:02:24.799 --> 01:02:27.927
You can't stay here.
I'm sorry, but...


785
01:02:28.595 --> 01:02:30.472
Is it reserved?

786
01:02:30.639 --> 01:02:32.681
What's wrong, we got lice?

787
01:02:32.682 --> 01:02:34.475
- I'm sorry.
- That's the limit!


788
01:02:34.476 --> 01:02:36.353
We gotta pay?

789
01:02:36.561 --> 01:02:38.061
I just follow orders.

790
01:02:38.062 --> 01:02:40.524
He follows orders!

791
01:02:40.732 --> 01:02:43.233
Well, I happen to like it here!

792
01:02:43.234 --> 01:02:46.863
Good day, sir!
My regards to the manager!


793
01:02:47.281 --> 01:02:50.033
You want money,
you little twerp?!


794
01:02:59.208 --> 01:03:01.169
- Bye, Rocco!
- Ciao.


795
01:03:17.269 --> 01:03:19.062
- Rocco!
- What is it?


796
01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:21.730
Seen my brother?

797
01:03:21.731 --> 01:03:24.149
He just left.
Didn't you bump into him?


798
01:03:24.150 --> 01:03:25.319
No, we didn't.

799
01:03:25.777 --> 01:03:26.986
Who's there?

800
01:03:27.236 --> 01:03:29.781
Just me.
I'm Rocco's brother.


801
01:03:29.989 --> 01:03:33.618
I have a package here.
I'll come by tomorrow.


802
01:03:34.244 --> 01:03:36.913
I'll leave it with the janitor.

803
01:03:37.205 --> 01:03:39.874
Leave it in the shop. Come on.

804
01:03:40.250 --> 01:03:43.001
Through there.
The door on the left.


805
01:03:43.002 --> 01:03:45.171
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.


806
01:03:47.716 --> 01:03:48.925
May I?

807
01:03:50.051 --> 01:03:52.136
- Anybody here?
- Come in.


808
01:03:55.432 --> 01:03:58.643
- Ah. Well, how are you?
- Oh, it's you.


809
01:03:59.185 --> 01:04:03.106
One of the girls said
I could leave this package.


810
01:04:03.523 --> 01:04:06.609
She didn't say you were here.
Just as well.


811
01:04:06.610 --> 01:04:07.610
What is it?

812
01:04:13.450 --> 01:04:15.034
Try to understand...

813
01:04:18.830 --> 01:04:21.416
It needs washing.
It's not mine.


814
01:04:21.541 --> 01:04:24.669
It's one of the shirts
that were there.


815
01:04:25.128 --> 01:04:27.506
I only wore it once.

816
01:04:28.214 --> 01:04:32.386
You said it would look better
on someone like me...


817
01:04:33.094 --> 01:04:35.221
What? Have you gone mad?!

818
01:04:36.097 --> 01:04:37.097
Answer me!

819
01:04:38.141 --> 01:04:41.810
And stop laughing! You come in
here asking favors..


820
01:04:41.811 --> 01:04:45.274
And then ridicule our courtesy..

821
01:04:45.649 --> 01:04:47.692
With your insolence!

822
01:04:49.068 --> 01:04:51.946
- Thief!
- I wasn't really stealing.


823
01:04:52.906 --> 01:04:55.074
That's hard to believe!

824
01:04:59.746 --> 01:05:04.167
You take advantage of people's
kindness and generosity.


825
01:05:04.709 --> 01:05:09.506
I'm so gullible, ready
to believe everyone and everything.


826
01:05:10.006 --> 01:05:13.009
It's a struggle for
a woman alone,..


827
01:05:13.217 --> 01:05:15.637
To keep track of everything.

828
01:05:18.390 --> 01:05:19.849
What do you want?

829
01:05:30.234 --> 01:05:31.945
No, don't...

830
01:06:00.849 --> 01:06:03.268
Why do they suspect you?

831
01:06:03.477 --> 01:06:04.936
I don't know.

832
01:06:05.354 --> 01:06:07.522
The boss keeps watching me.

833
01:06:07.897 --> 01:06:09.566
She's a little crazy.

834
01:06:11.025 --> 01:06:12.110
That's true.

835
01:06:15.739 --> 01:06:18.575
But the girls
keep watching me too.


836
01:06:19.993 --> 01:06:25.123
- Tomorrow let's go to the police and straighten it out.
- Yeah.


837
01:06:25.540 --> 01:06:26.625
Parondi!

838
01:06:26.833 --> 01:06:29.167
Parondi,
you're wanted at the entrance!


839
01:06:29.168 --> 01:06:31.296
They've come to arrest me!

840
01:06:32.213 --> 01:06:34.341
Who's calling our name?

841
01:06:39.679 --> 01:06:42.516
- No, I'll go.
- Yes, you go.


842
01:06:47.562 --> 01:06:49.897
- What's up?
- They want Vincenzo Parondi..


843
01:06:49.898 --> 01:06:51.858
Upstairs.
- Vincenzo?


844
01:06:53.735 --> 01:06:55.654
He's not here.

845
01:06:57.238 --> 01:07:01.535
You know where he is?
What do they want?


846
01:07:02.076 --> 01:07:04.621
I don't know. I'll go.

847
01:07:04.829 --> 01:07:06.665
- Yes.
- Goodnight.


848
01:07:09.418 --> 01:07:12.920
Do you know what they want
with him and at this hour?


849
01:07:12.921 --> 01:07:15.298
- It's not that late.
- What time is it?


850
01:07:15.299 --> 01:07:16.966
- It's only 10.
- Oh.


851
01:07:18.217 --> 01:07:19.511
Go back to bed.

852
01:07:22.764 --> 01:07:23.807
Shall I come?

853
01:07:24.349 --> 01:07:26.351
You stay here with Mamma.

854
01:07:29.271 --> 01:07:31.523
- Ciao, Rocco!
- Good night.


855
01:07:39.948 --> 01:07:41.241
What's wrong?

856
01:07:41.450 --> 01:07:43.577
Go to sleep.

857
01:07:47.622 --> 01:07:50.417
What about you?
When'll you finish?


858
01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:55.589
I still have to study.
I'll wait up for Rocco.


859
01:07:56.965 --> 01:07:58.258
All right.

860
01:08:05.181 --> 01:08:07.100
Simone isn't back yet...

861
01:08:09.686 --> 01:08:12.564
Neither is Vincenzo.
Oh, these boys!


862
01:08:16.318 --> 01:08:19.988
Hey, you! Hurry up.

863
01:08:22.574 --> 01:08:25.368
- Am I the one you want?
- You're Vincenzo?


864
01:08:25.369 --> 01:08:27.621
No, he's with Ginetta.

865
01:08:28.037 --> 01:08:31.457
They're engaged,
but Mamma doesn't approve..


866
01:08:31.458 --> 01:08:36.880
So they meet outside
otherwise she makes a scene.


867
01:08:37.046 --> 01:08:39.674
I don't want your family history.

868
01:08:39.924 --> 01:08:42.677
- Who are you?
- Rocco.


869
01:08:43.470 --> 01:08:44.929
Oh, yeah...

870
01:08:45.722 --> 01:08:48.141
I have to talk to you.
Hop in.


871
01:08:49.268 --> 01:08:51.311
Not here. The other side.

872
01:08:58.318 --> 01:09:01.988
If I don't practise driving,
I'll never learn.


873
01:09:02.781 --> 01:09:04.616
Is that street one-way?

874
01:09:06.326 --> 01:09:08.787
- I don't drive.
- Oh, great!


875
01:09:12.374 --> 01:09:14.543
Yup, it's one-way.

876
01:09:19.589 --> 01:09:22.384
The whole world's
a one-way street.


877
01:09:25.094 --> 01:09:28.848
- Where we going?
- Where I won't meet anybody.


878
01:09:33.102 --> 01:09:34.271
This is good.

879
01:09:35.730 --> 01:09:39.651
I asked for Vincenzo because
I know him better,..


880
01:09:40.360 --> 01:09:41.736
But you'll do.

881
01:09:42.946 --> 01:09:44.698
Do you recognize this?

882
01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:51.663
Simone says he bought it,..

883
01:09:51.871 --> 01:09:55.542
I say he stole it.
And I don't care where.


884
01:09:56.710 --> 01:10:00.839
I've got enough troubles.
I can't take risks.


885
01:10:03.883 --> 01:10:05.677
Do you understand?

886
01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:07.804
Great!

887
01:10:09.222 --> 01:10:12.309
- Why steal...?
- To make me happy.


888
01:10:12.809 --> 01:10:16.145
Seems I'm worth it.
I'm not?


889
01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:21.067
What are you wearing under there?

890
01:10:21.568 --> 01:10:23.236
I was already in bed.

891
01:10:27.366 --> 01:10:29.576
You're nice and warm.

892
01:10:31.661 --> 01:10:33.747
Don't worry, I don't bite.

893
01:10:35.499 --> 01:10:38.917
Tell your brother that
I'm giving back this stuff.


894
01:10:38.918 --> 01:10:42.255
Thank him, but tell him not
to come looking for me.


895
01:10:42.256 --> 01:10:43.507
You understand?

896
01:10:44.716 --> 01:10:47.511
"Nadia's left.
She's gone forever".


897
01:10:48.470 --> 01:10:52.807
What are you staring at?
I look strange, or something?


898
01:10:53.182 --> 01:10:57.020
No, you're not strange.
You're very considerate.


899
01:10:57.687 --> 01:11:01.065
- Why did he do it?
- Why do you think?


900
01:11:01.441 --> 01:11:06.029
Good night, little boy.
I'm glad you find me considerate.


901
01:11:06.613 --> 01:11:09.824
Sorry I can't drive you back,
it's late.


902
01:11:10.617 --> 01:11:16.456
Stop being so scared.
Now beat it!


903
01:11:20.669 --> 01:11:21.669
Hey!

904
01:11:57.372 --> 01:12:00.959
You're back!
Who'd they want, you or me?


905
01:12:03.002 --> 01:12:07.841
They wanted me, at the shop,
for the keys to the storeroom.


906
01:12:08.342 --> 01:12:11.135
- The keys to the storeroom?
- Yes.


907
01:12:15.904 --> 01:12:17.030
And the theft?

908
01:12:20.992 --> 01:12:25.330
There wasn't one. She found
the pin. It wasn't stolen.


909
01:12:25.872 --> 01:12:28.875
- She's crazy.
- I told you.


910
01:12:32.086 --> 01:12:35.424
- I'm quitting.
- But it's a good job.


911
01:12:36.466 --> 01:12:37.676
Not any more.

912
01:12:38.927 --> 01:12:42.847
You should find something
better before quitting.


913
01:12:42.931 --> 01:12:43.973
I did.

914
01:12:46.893 --> 01:12:49.813
See this?
It's my draft card.


915
01:12:51.064 --> 01:12:52.774
It came this morning.

916
01:12:53.525 --> 01:12:57.362
But with everything going on,
I forgot about it.


917
01:12:58.780 --> 01:13:01.908
- I've been drafted.
- Good luck, then.


918
01:13:05.370 --> 01:13:07.080
You hear that?

919
01:13:07.289 --> 01:13:10.208
It's his turn now.
Good night.


920
01:13:11.293 --> 01:13:13.337
- Simone?
- What?


921
01:13:15.505 --> 01:13:17.424
I'd like to talk to you.

922
01:13:20.009 --> 01:13:24.055
Coming back from the shop,
I ran into a girl.


923
01:13:28.310 --> 01:13:32.314
The daughter of that family
at Lambrate, remember?


924
01:13:33.064 --> 01:13:34.148
Yeah.

925
01:13:36.192 --> 01:13:40.029
She said she's leaving,
going away.


926
01:13:40.989 --> 01:13:44.075
- When did you see her?
- Just now.


927
01:13:44.909 --> 01:13:46.703
Going where?

928
01:13:47.829 --> 01:13:50.665
She didn't say.

929
01:13:57.714 --> 01:13:59.424
You know her too?

930
01:14:03.052 --> 01:14:06.348
What's she want?
What's with her, anyway?


931
01:14:07.391 --> 01:14:09.601
She's just another girl..

932
01:14:14.273 --> 01:14:16.232
Trying to be a lady.

933
01:14:17.817 --> 01:14:19.278
Who needs her?!

934
01:14:23.532 --> 01:14:25.617
I got better things to do.

935
01:14:29.996 --> 01:14:35.919
From now on,
I don't know who she is.


936
01:14:38.087 --> 01:14:40.757
If you see her tell her that!

937
01:15:44.821 --> 01:15:49.033
"We finally moved into
the new apartment."


938
01:15:49.868 --> 01:15:53.621
"Everyone knows us since Simone
won that fight in Genoa."


939
01:15:53.622 --> 01:15:59.878
"They treat me with respect.
It would have been a good year.."


940
01:16:00.254 --> 01:16:05.049
"but Vincenzo got Ginetta
pregnant and had to marry her."


941
01:16:05.467 --> 01:16:09.888
"Now he's gone, and you're off
doing military service."


942
01:16:13.267 --> 01:16:17.521
"Simone can't work, because
he has to keep training."


943
01:16:18.272 --> 01:16:22.984
"Ciro has a new job
at the Alfa Romeo plant.."


944
01:16:23.652 --> 01:16:26.780
"thanks to his night
school diploma."


945
01:16:28.114 --> 01:16:32.911
"He's the only one bringing
any money in. And the expenses!"


946
01:16:33.620 --> 01:16:37.540
"If you have anything left
from your pay, send it."


947
01:16:37.541 --> 01:16:41.043
"You can't spend it anyhow.
We're all well."


948
01:16:41.044 --> 01:16:45.632
"I hope you are too. A big hug
from, your loving Mother."


949
01:17:06.951 --> 01:17:07.951
Hey!

950
01:17:11.789 --> 01:17:13.833
I wasn't wrong, it's you.

951
01:17:14.166 --> 01:17:16.002
What's with that getup?

952
01:17:16.544 --> 01:17:17.712
I'm a soldier.

953
01:17:17.920 --> 01:17:20.673
That's pretty obvious.
Since when?


954
01:17:21.383 --> 01:17:23.091
I've served 14 months.

955
01:17:23.092 --> 01:17:27.472
Me too. More or less.
In this same town.


956
01:17:29.974 --> 01:17:32.226
Buy me a coffee.

957
01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:36.439
I'd like to, but I just sent
money to my mother.


958
01:17:37.690 --> 01:17:39.276
I'll buy, you chump!

959
01:17:40.151 --> 01:17:44.237
Better yet, we'll hire
a carriage and ride through town...


960
01:17:44.238 --> 01:17:45.739
I'll take your bag.

961
01:17:45.740 --> 01:17:49.118
And have coffee
in a decent place.


962
01:17:49.577 --> 01:17:52.997
Driver, put the top down,
we need some air.


963
01:18:18.273 --> 01:18:20.650
- You didn't understand?
- No.


964
01:18:24.446 --> 01:18:26.864
13 months and 8 days.

965
01:18:29.784 --> 01:18:35.206
No suspended sentence
because of my record.


966
01:18:38.793 --> 01:18:39.877
Was it bad?

967
01:18:40.712 --> 01:18:43.715
Fairly but bearable.

968
01:18:45.925 --> 01:18:49.136
Time flies
when every day's the same.


969
01:18:51.180 --> 01:18:55.059
Wouldn't seem so but it's true.

970
01:19:09.156 --> 01:19:11.243
Hey, wake up!

971
01:19:13.995 --> 01:19:16.998
Does knowing
an ex-inmate bother you?


972
01:19:17.332 --> 01:19:19.334
It's not that unusual.

973
01:19:20.918 --> 01:19:22.629
There wasn't only me.

974
01:19:24.005 --> 01:19:26.632
But I'm the first one you've met?

975
01:19:26.633 --> 01:19:32.347
No, some friends in my home town,..

976
01:19:33.515 --> 01:19:38.853
My own age,
poorer than you could ever imagine.


977
01:19:40.272 --> 01:19:44.526
They were lead to believe
they could farm some land.


978
01:19:45.360 --> 01:19:50.281
But the land was arid, and the work
backbreaking, and it took hours..


979
01:19:50.282 --> 01:19:57.705
To reach the place. Then one day,
they spoke up, and rebelled.


980
01:20:01.042 --> 01:20:05.630
They were arrested..

981
01:20:07.632 --> 01:20:09.717
In Matera, in Potenza.

982
01:20:12.512 --> 01:20:14.472
My town was like that.

983
01:20:19.769 --> 01:20:23.565
I understand.
That's why you all came North?


984
01:20:23.940 --> 01:20:25.733
I'd have stayed.

985
01:20:25.900 --> 01:20:27.985
You don't like Milan?

986
01:20:28.695 --> 01:20:34.951
If only we had the means
to live decently,..


987
01:20:36.244 --> 01:20:38.246
Here where we grew up.

988
01:20:39.121 --> 01:20:41.583
I'm lost in the city.

989
01:20:41.916 --> 01:20:45.253
I was neither born
nor raised in one.


990
01:20:47.339 --> 01:20:51.343
Not only me,
but my brothers and my friends.


991
01:20:53.595 --> 01:20:56.598
Some get used to city life,..

992
01:20:57.515 --> 01:21:00.685
And seek
the pleasures of city people.


993
01:21:01.686 --> 01:21:02.686
Not me.

994
01:21:04.856 --> 01:21:06.983
I don't think that's right.

995
01:21:10.027 --> 01:21:14.699
I mean,
I want an automobile too.


996
01:21:15.450 --> 01:21:18.620
But after the things
that come first,..


997
01:21:18.953 --> 01:21:23.207
A steady job, a home,
and eating every day.


998
01:21:24.626 --> 01:21:26.503
Do I make myself clear?

999
01:21:28.045 --> 01:21:29.547
Your opinion of me?

1000
01:21:30.715 --> 01:21:31.715
Nothing.

1001
01:21:31.966 --> 01:21:33.510
Aren't you curious?

1002
01:21:34.719 --> 01:21:36.804
Speak up.

1003
01:21:37.805 --> 01:21:41.183
I was wondering...
How old are you?


1004
01:21:43.311 --> 01:21:44.646
That's easy,..

1005
01:21:45.980 --> 01:21:47.649
25, so what?

1006
01:21:48.316 --> 01:21:51.110
You said:
"Aren't you curious?"...


1007
01:21:51.569 --> 01:21:53.738
Nothing else interests you?

1008
01:21:53.905 --> 01:21:55.490
I offended you.

1009
01:21:56.658 --> 01:21:57.909
Did you?

1010
01:22:00.828 --> 01:22:02.997
You keep staring at me...

1011
01:22:05.667 --> 01:22:06.918
Forgive me.

1012
01:22:08.420 --> 01:22:12.757
But, somehow,
I feel great pity for you.


1013
01:22:14.426 --> 01:22:15.927
How nice!

1014
01:22:19.096 --> 01:22:21.140
Actually, I'm very tired.

1015
01:22:23.184 --> 01:22:25.978
I wasn't exactly on vacation,..

1016
01:22:26.938 --> 01:22:29.316
And what's to come is worse.

1017
01:22:29.441 --> 01:22:32.944
Don't say that.
One can live as he likes,..


1018
01:22:33.110 --> 01:22:34.779
If he chooses to.

1019
01:22:35.947 --> 01:22:40.785
But you shouldn't be afraid
and you seem to be.


1020
01:22:41.453 --> 01:22:43.371
You're really something.

1021
01:22:46.374 --> 01:22:50.169
Say no more. Look
at the effect you have on me.


1022
01:22:50.295 --> 01:22:52.589
You want me to go?

1023
01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:55.967
What a dope!
Take me to the station,..


1024
01:22:57.469 --> 01:23:01.639
But enough talk about me,
it's depressing.


1025
01:23:05.560 --> 01:23:06.894
What's your cure?

1026
01:23:08.980 --> 01:23:13.651
Have faith and have no fear.
Great faith...


1027
01:23:16.321 --> 01:23:17.739
In what?

1028
01:23:17.905 --> 01:23:20.283
I don't know...
in everything.


1029
01:23:23.411 --> 01:23:24.411
In you?

1030
01:23:25.079 --> 01:23:26.331
In me too.

1031
01:23:30.001 --> 01:23:32.587
- Can we meet in Milan?
- Yes.


1032
01:23:34.171 --> 01:23:37.342
Maybe you can teach me
not to be afraid.


1033
01:23:39.761 --> 01:23:40.761
Sure!

1034
01:23:42.639 --> 01:23:43.639
Yes.

1035
01:24:21.303 --> 01:24:22.303
Rocco.

1036
01:24:24.722 --> 01:24:26.641
Mamma's boy Rocco.

1037
01:24:29.226 --> 01:24:31.979
Oh, my boy, you're so handsome!

1038
01:24:33.815 --> 01:24:35.066
Come on!

1039
01:24:36.318 --> 01:24:38.902
I was just
getting your bed ready.


1040
01:24:38.903 --> 01:24:41.406
They delivered it yesterday.

1041
01:24:42.324 --> 01:24:46.494
Look at him, he's just back
from the service!


1042
01:24:47.078 --> 01:24:48.913
Let them see you.

1043
01:24:49.664 --> 01:24:51.958
How handsome my boy is!

1044
01:24:52.334 --> 01:24:55.962
See, not much furniture,
but we'll get there.


1045
01:24:56.170 --> 01:25:00.007
Ah, but Saint Rocco
is always in my bedroom.


1046
01:25:01.343 --> 01:25:02.469
You look good.

1047
01:25:02.510 --> 01:25:05.472
Oh, but my teeth are troubling me.

1048
01:25:05.930 --> 01:25:07.432
You like it here?

1049
01:25:08.850 --> 01:25:10.226
Yes, but...

1050
01:25:12.186 --> 01:25:13.605
Where's everybody?

1051
01:25:13.855 --> 01:25:18.109
I purposely came on Sunday
when everyone's home.


1052
01:25:19.277 --> 01:25:21.946
- I even wrote.
- I know but...


1053
01:25:22.447 --> 01:25:26.868
I kept saying: Ciro will surely
meet me at the station.


1054
01:25:30.121 --> 01:25:33.333
They'll be here at noon.
Don't be upset.


1055
01:25:34.542 --> 01:25:38.296
Tell me where to put your bed.
Come on!


1056
01:25:40.632 --> 01:25:44.301
I sleep there with Luca.
You three'll sleep here.


1057
01:25:44.302 --> 01:25:48.473
Simone, Ciro,
and you, my sweet boy!


1058
01:25:52.560 --> 01:25:53.561
You know...

1059
01:25:55.146 --> 01:25:59.066
Ciro's been so wonderful,
you can't imagine!


1060
01:26:02.987 --> 01:26:06.366
They're at the Baptism
of Vincenzo's baby.


1061
01:26:06.658 --> 01:26:09.243
- And you're not going?
- Not me. No.


1062
01:26:09.244 --> 01:26:12.330
- Why is that?
- You were arriving.


1063
01:26:12.789 --> 01:26:15.958
That's no reason,
I could've joined you.


1064
01:26:16.083 --> 01:26:19.921
- Let's go now.
- No, it's too late now.


1065
01:26:24.592 --> 01:26:27.845
You're not still angry
with Vincenzo?


1066
01:26:28.012 --> 01:26:32.099
No, he always comes to visit me.

1067
01:26:33.935 --> 01:26:37.272
- And Ginetta?
- Not Ginetta.


1068
01:26:39.316 --> 01:26:42.277
Not even now
that she's had the baby?


1069
01:26:42.485 --> 01:26:45.947
Do you think her folks invite
your brother?


1070
01:26:47.031 --> 01:26:50.452
Let me go.
I'd like to see them.


1071
01:26:53.288 --> 01:26:54.289
Go ahead.

1072
01:26:55.957 --> 01:26:56.957
Thanks.

1073
01:27:00.878 --> 01:27:03.047
- Ciao, Mamma.
- Ciao.


1074
01:27:19.146 --> 01:27:22.984
- Ciao, Luca. Ciao, Vincenzo.
- So, you're back!


1075
01:27:24.902 --> 01:27:27.488
Ciao, Ginetta.
He's so handsome!


1076
01:27:27.489 --> 01:27:31.075
- We named him Antonio.
- Antonio, like Papà.


1077
01:27:31.158 --> 01:27:33.911
- May I hold him?
- Why not?


1078
01:27:35.121 --> 01:27:40.752
Antonio.
What a lovely baby! Antonio!


1079
01:27:41.961 --> 01:27:45.172
Move!
Get the lead outta your legs!


1080
01:27:45.632 --> 01:27:47.174
Pure lead!

1081
01:27:52.597 --> 01:27:56.099
Don't make me use gloves
just before the fight.


1082
01:27:56.100 --> 01:27:58.603
I know what's best.

1083
01:27:59.145 --> 01:28:02.022
I can't get him to understand
what he's up against.


1084
01:28:02.023 --> 01:28:05.943
- Someone who hits hard.
- I told him.


1085
01:28:06.193 --> 01:28:09.946
- That's what you always say.
- This time it's true.


1086
01:28:09.947 --> 01:28:14.035
A guy's got a chance
if he's fast. But you're not.


1087
01:28:16.037 --> 01:28:19.416
Well, then it's your fault.

1088
01:28:19.707 --> 01:28:22.419
I never sparred
with anybody fast.


1089
01:28:22.585 --> 01:28:24.546
Sure, sure!

1090
01:28:26.881 --> 01:28:28.841
I'll find the right guy.

1091
01:28:30.385 --> 01:28:31.928
Put some gloves on.

1092
01:28:32.637 --> 01:28:33.638
Come on!

1093
01:28:35.139 --> 01:28:36.474
- Me?
- Yes.


1094
01:28:36.683 --> 01:28:39.769
- Very funny.
- Let him try.


1095
01:28:39.894 --> 01:28:43.565
Yeah,
try staying on his feet tomorrow!


1096
01:28:43.815 --> 01:28:45.900
Put some gloves on!

1097
01:28:46.233 --> 01:28:48.903
Jab! Left! Left!

1098
01:28:54.659 --> 01:28:57.412
Look, I'm up against clowns!

1099
01:29:02.208 --> 01:29:05.337
Sacks of potatoes,
that's all they are!


1100
01:29:06.379 --> 01:29:09.548
We'll be a laughingstock tomorrow.
Shitheads!


1101
01:29:09.549 --> 01:29:11.843
What a brainless bunch.

1102
01:29:14.679 --> 01:29:16.097
I'm through!

1103
01:29:16.306 --> 01:29:18.182
I've had it!

1104
01:29:18.516 --> 01:29:20.977
I want real boxers, who care!

1105
01:29:21.269 --> 01:29:24.355
You're clodhoppers!
These Milanese are right.


1106
01:29:24.356 --> 01:29:27.107
Dirt-pushers. I can do without you!

1107
01:29:27.108 --> 01:29:29.318
Hey, come take a look, come on.

1108
01:29:29.319 --> 01:29:31.028
- Cerri!
- What's up?


1109
01:29:31.112 --> 01:29:35.742
- Come and take a look.
- I don't want to see anything...


1110
01:29:37.285 --> 01:29:39.329
- Come on!
- Nothing.


1111
01:29:39.454 --> 01:29:42.122
- Come on out, Cerri.
- No, I don't feel like it.


1112
01:29:42.123 --> 01:29:46.544
- It's worth it.
- What's there to see? - A real show.


1113
01:29:53.134 --> 01:29:54.926
See that?
Ain't it wonderful?


1114
01:29:54.927 --> 01:29:56.638
He woke up.

1115
01:29:57.639 --> 01:29:58.639
Great!

1116
01:30:00.808 --> 01:30:04.479
Good, work him like that.
Listen to me.


1117
01:30:06.147 --> 01:30:09.442
That's it.

1118
01:30:10.151 --> 01:30:11.569
I'm coming.

1119
01:30:12.236 --> 01:30:14.322
Use your left.

1120
01:30:14.572 --> 01:30:19.076
Come on, Simone! Wake up!

1121
01:30:20.453 --> 01:30:23.038
- That kid, you know...
- He's not bad.


1122
01:30:23.039 --> 01:30:24.916
He's not bad at all!

1123
01:30:25.250 --> 01:30:28.295
He's okay.
Look how he dodges punches.


1124
01:30:28.753 --> 01:30:29.921
Go on, get him!

1125
01:30:32.965 --> 01:30:36.678
Leave things up to me
before a fight.


1126
01:30:37.094 --> 01:30:38.430
I get nervous!

1127
01:30:39.264 --> 01:30:42.309
You get up there with Rocco.

1128
01:30:42.517 --> 01:30:44.269
Your turn, Dal Piaz!

1129
01:30:46.103 --> 01:30:47.480
Time!

1130
01:30:50.024 --> 01:30:51.651
He boxes real nice.

1131
01:30:51.776 --> 01:30:57.031
Simone, watch it,
or he'll grab your place.


1132
01:30:58.783 --> 01:31:00.368
Tomorrow, huh?

1133
01:31:01.035 --> 01:31:04.956
Yeah, tomorrow we'll see
if you do like I say...


1134
01:31:07.375 --> 01:31:10.378
Well done!
You've made progress, kid!


1135
01:31:11.003 --> 01:31:14.173
In the army,
we'd work out together..


1136
01:31:14.382 --> 01:31:18.302
I even fought a few matches.
- How did you get on?


1137
01:31:18.303 --> 01:31:20.804
Two draws and a win, but it's...

1138
01:31:20.805 --> 01:31:22.974
- Ah!
- Not for me.


1139
01:31:23.224 --> 01:31:25.100
- You don't like it?
- No.


1140
01:31:25.101 --> 01:31:26.893
I'm going now, It's late...

1141
01:31:26.894 --> 01:31:29.481
- Have a massage first.
- Okay.


1142
01:31:32.066 --> 01:31:34.068
- What's up?
- Nothing.


1143
01:32:37.715 --> 01:32:41.886
Clod, Get back on the farm!

1144
01:33:28.766 --> 01:33:30.602
I can't take anymore.

1145
01:33:33.104 --> 01:33:36.607
- Throw in the towel.
- Don't give up now, you fool.


1146
01:33:36.608 --> 01:33:41.195
- Throw in the towel.
- Don't give up. - I can't take it!


1147
01:33:45.700 --> 01:33:48.619
Listen to me. There's only
one thing you can do,..


1148
01:33:48.620 --> 01:33:51.873
Use you left,
understand, your left!


1149
01:33:52.123 --> 01:33:54.917
- I can't take it.
- Not the right.


1150
01:34:18.232 --> 01:34:20.567
- Throw in the towel.
- Don't quit now,..


1151
01:34:20.568 --> 01:34:22.653
You damn fool!
- 5, 6, 7,..


1152
01:34:22.654 --> 01:34:24.406
8.
- The towel!


1153
01:34:46.844 --> 01:34:48.054
Breathe deeply.

1154
01:34:50.848 --> 01:34:53.768
Damn! It was a draw up to now.

1155
01:34:54.436 --> 01:34:57.021
He loses a round: "The towel!".

1156
01:34:58.523 --> 01:35:02.025
- I shouldn't have thrown it in.
- After seven rounds,..


1157
01:35:02.026 --> 01:35:03.986
The winner is Webster.

1158
01:35:06.531 --> 01:35:08.199
Don't blame me.

1159
01:35:08.366 --> 01:35:12.454
What's the use?
I'll blame who I damn please!


1160
01:35:12.620 --> 01:35:16.291
My fault anyway!
Who gives a damn about him?!


1161
01:35:16.624 --> 01:35:20.377
My reputation, my interests
are at stake here..


1162
01:35:20.378 --> 01:35:22.964
Not his!
- It's all over now.


1163
01:35:23.298 --> 01:35:25.383
Great show, your brother!

1164
01:35:25.633 --> 01:35:29.219
I found him changed
when I came back from the service.


1165
01:35:29.220 --> 01:35:32.473
Stop defending him,
we both know how things went.


1166
01:35:32.474 --> 01:35:38.646
As things stand now
you can't say no to me.


1167
01:35:39.731 --> 01:35:42.359
You're indebted for the trouble..

1168
01:35:42.484 --> 01:35:46.654
Your brother put me through.
Agreed?


1169
01:35:48.906 --> 01:35:51.368
- How come your boy lost?
- Eh!


1170
01:35:54.078 --> 01:35:55.580
You're mincemeat.

1171
01:35:56.414 --> 01:35:57.499
Shut up!

1172
01:35:58.500 --> 01:36:00.502
Your attention, please.

1173
01:36:00.668 --> 01:36:03.421
Did you hear what they said?

1174
01:36:04.171 --> 01:36:05.507
That was nothing.

1175
01:36:06.258 --> 01:36:08.760
Cerri threw his usual fit.

1176
01:36:09.927 --> 01:36:12.764
He wasn't wrong
but he calmed down.


1177
01:36:14.766 --> 01:36:18.102
He even said
he'd try your brother.


1178
01:36:18.686 --> 01:36:19.854
Who? Rocco?

1179
01:36:22.524 --> 01:36:26.694
If your brother accepts
he'll have to cool it too.


1180
01:36:30.865 --> 01:36:32.867
With the hookers, I mean.

1181
01:36:33.618 --> 01:36:36.704
On that score,
he's the world champion.


1182
01:36:38.706 --> 01:36:42.794
What about that bloodsucker
who beat you to a pulp?


1183
01:36:44.546 --> 01:36:46.797
Don't tell me you don't know?

1184
01:36:46.798 --> 01:36:49.883
The whole town knows
about your brother..


1185
01:36:49.884 --> 01:36:53.805
And his great love
they've been seen together.


1186
01:36:58.059 --> 01:36:59.561
I checked.

1187
01:37:00.478 --> 01:37:03.940
He hangs out
around the Ghisolfa, at night.


1188
01:37:07.485 --> 01:37:09.321
With Nadia.

1189
01:37:12.990 --> 01:37:16.411
Don't tell me now
that you didn't know?


1190
01:37:18.996 --> 01:37:19.997
No, I didn't.

1191
01:37:20.248 --> 01:37:23.668
They say she's in love.

1192
01:37:24.586 --> 01:37:28.423
Rossi's the one who told me.
Nino, you remember?


1193
01:37:28.506 --> 01:37:30.842
Nadia was crazy about him.

1194
01:37:31.175 --> 01:37:35.137
Now she turns her back on him
and everybody else.


1195
01:37:36.598 --> 01:37:39.767
She's going
to some secretarial school.


1196
01:37:41.519 --> 01:37:44.105
A real Saint Agnes.

1197
01:37:46.190 --> 01:37:47.190
Stop that!

1198
01:38:28.816 --> 01:38:31.568
- Who's paying the bet?
- Pay up. I won.


1199
01:38:31.569 --> 01:38:34.155
And one coffee, I'm freezing.

1200
01:38:34.322 --> 01:38:37.074
- One coffee!
- Laced with grappa.


1201
01:38:39.076 --> 01:38:40.161
So?

1202
01:38:41.246 --> 01:38:43.748
So I followed him,..

1203
01:38:43.998 --> 01:38:46.418
He was with a blonde.

1204
01:38:47.335 --> 01:38:50.297
- Whereabouts?
- Over by the viaduct.


1205
01:38:51.172 --> 01:38:56.511
They all go there,
near where the train passes.


1206
01:38:56.928 --> 01:39:00.014
We could be wrong,
maybe it isn't her.


1207
01:39:01.516 --> 01:39:04.602
Don't be a chump,
it's her, all right.


1208
01:39:07.439 --> 01:39:09.357
Okay. Let's go.

1209
01:39:11.108 --> 01:39:13.278
And Camisasca? Riguttini?

1210
01:39:13.778 --> 01:39:18.365
They're following them, who are
probably at the sanatorium by now.


1211
01:39:18.366 --> 01:39:21.035
I'll get my bike and show you.

1212
01:39:26.040 --> 01:39:29.294
How can they make out
in this weather?!


1213
01:39:29.461 --> 01:39:30.461
Move it.

1214
01:39:31.379 --> 01:39:33.798
Hey, Romeo, over!

1215
01:39:40.972 --> 01:39:43.974
- Are they there?
- They're there. Let's go.


1216
01:39:43.975 --> 01:39:46.894
If it's not them, you've had it!

1217
01:40:06.581 --> 01:40:09.751
They went down,
by the shack, just now.


1218
01:40:12.837 --> 01:40:16.132
You go along the river.
I'll go this way.


1219
01:40:16.173 --> 01:40:19.594
And wait for my signal.

1220
01:40:22.597 --> 01:40:24.807
- You're going alone?
- Yes.


1221
01:41:51.853 --> 01:41:53.855
Hear that? What was it?

1222
01:41:54.772 --> 01:41:58.276
It's nothing, probably a cat.

1223
01:42:02.029 --> 01:42:03.029
Don't move.

1224
01:42:03.948 --> 01:42:05.116
Don't move!

1225
01:42:05.783 --> 01:42:09.036
What's wrong
being with whom I like?


1226
01:42:13.375 --> 01:42:16.043
Not with her, she was mine.

1227
01:42:18.380 --> 01:42:22.800
I'm not taking that from you.
Understand?


1228
01:42:25.387 --> 01:42:29.307
That's all over.
You haven't seen her in 2 years.


1229
01:42:36.564 --> 01:42:38.232
Come on, Rocco.

1230
01:42:46.991 --> 01:42:48.285
What's going on?

1231
01:42:48.826 --> 01:42:49.911
Huh, Simone?

1232
01:42:50.828 --> 01:42:52.204
What do you want?

1233
01:42:52.664 --> 01:42:55.082
First, Rocco's apologies.

1234
01:43:01.256 --> 01:43:02.590
Why?

1235
01:43:04.592 --> 01:43:06.511
You coward!

1236
01:43:06.761 --> 01:43:09.514
Look,
he lets a woman protect him.


1237
01:43:09.681 --> 01:43:10.848
The rat!

1238
01:43:11.349 --> 01:43:13.851
Ask my forgiveness!

1239
01:43:14.936 --> 01:43:19.566
- Can't you see? He's drunk.
- Ask my forgiveness, I said!


1240
01:43:21.526 --> 01:43:22.860
Stop!

1241
01:43:23.027 --> 01:43:26.196
- Don't, Simone!
- I'll do what I want.


1242
01:43:26.197 --> 01:43:29.116
- No!
- Being cheated on for him!


1243
01:43:31.035 --> 01:43:35.790
Take a look at your Nadia!
At how she makes love!


1244
01:43:41.963 --> 01:43:44.716
Let him see what you are!

1245
01:43:46.634 --> 01:43:49.220
Hold on to him!
He'll watch.


1246
01:43:49.471 --> 01:43:52.974
- He has to learn.
- Rocco! Rocco!


1247
01:43:53.558 --> 01:43:56.227
No, Simone, don't do it!

1248
01:43:56.561 --> 01:43:58.313
Rocco, help me!

1249
01:43:59.814 --> 01:44:05.152
- Rocco! Rocco!
- Simone, don't!


1250
01:44:08.406 --> 01:44:10.492
- Grab...
- Rocco!


1251
01:44:10.658 --> 01:44:13.076
- And kiss them if you can.
- No! Rocco!


1252
01:44:13.077 --> 01:44:16.456
You only know how to make love
with these.


1253
01:44:19.917 --> 01:44:22.629
No! Rocco, help me!
Simone, don't!


1254
01:44:23.170 --> 01:44:24.922
Simone!

1255
01:45:18.893 --> 01:45:19.893
Rocco!

1256
01:45:20.562 --> 01:45:21.562
Rocco!

1257
01:45:22.897 --> 01:45:25.400
Say something. 
Tell me it's...

1258
01:45:25.900 --> 01:45:28.235
Rocco, tell me it's...

1259
01:46:18.786 --> 01:46:20.872
You learned your lesson!

1260
01:46:21.456 --> 01:46:23.875
We'll discuss it at home.

1261
01:46:28.546 --> 01:46:29.881
You disgust me.

1262
01:46:31.633 --> 01:46:33.718
I dare you to repeat that.

1263
01:46:36.053 --> 01:46:37.389
You disgust me.

1264
01:46:40.057 --> 01:46:41.809
Simone, that's enough!

1265
01:46:43.395 --> 01:46:45.979
You're my brother,
I can't help that!


1266
01:46:45.980 --> 01:46:50.818
But that didn't stop you.
It does now because you're afraid.


1267
01:46:52.570 --> 01:46:53.988
I'm not afraid.

1268
01:46:55.323 --> 01:46:58.576
Then, come on. Show me.

1269
01:47:02.497 --> 01:47:04.748
Simone, you crazy?
Supposing someone shows up?


1270
01:47:04.749 --> 01:47:06.000
Scram!

1271
01:47:20.515 --> 01:47:22.267
Simone, cut it out!

1272
01:49:43.082 --> 01:49:44.750
Come on, get in.

1273
01:50:17.283 --> 01:50:22.872
Vincenzo, the doorbell.

1274
01:50:23.539 --> 01:50:26.291
- The doorbell.
- Go see who's there.


1275
01:50:26.292 --> 01:50:27.292
Go on!

1276
01:50:40.723 --> 01:50:42.057
Rocco!

1277
01:50:42.558 --> 01:50:44.477
What happened?

1278
01:50:46.562 --> 01:50:49.732
- Ginetta, look.
- What happened?


1279
01:50:50.983 --> 01:50:52.902
Rocco!

1280
01:51:01.994 --> 01:51:03.579
Nothing, nothing.

1281
01:51:04.914 --> 01:51:07.082
Nothing, nothing.

1282
01:51:09.001 --> 01:51:13.339
- Vincenzo, let me stay here with you.
- Okay.


1283
01:51:16.259 --> 01:51:18.177
Let them know at home,..

1284
01:51:20.763 --> 01:51:23.057
Otherwise Mamma will worry.

1285
01:51:26.018 --> 01:51:27.770
Oh, God! He's fainted!

1286
01:51:28.187 --> 01:51:30.315
Ginetta, some water! Hurry!

1287
01:51:37.947 --> 01:51:41.326
How could I know
Simone loved you so much?


1288
01:51:43.536 --> 01:51:46.622
I knew something
had changed in him...


1289
01:51:47.457 --> 01:51:49.292
in his good nature.

1290
01:51:52.295 --> 01:51:55.715
But not that you were the reason.

1291
01:51:56.716 --> 01:51:58.718
It's not true.

1292
01:52:00.803 --> 01:52:05.475
Only a man
who's become desperate.


1293
01:52:06.476 --> 01:52:10.646
He's vile, cruel. I love you.
Don't you believe me?


1294
01:52:11.063 --> 01:52:14.942
Then it's all useless.
I can't believe anything.


1295
01:52:15.485 --> 01:52:18.488
If you keep on
like this, I'll jump.


1296
01:52:18.988 --> 01:52:20.365
I'll kill myself!

1297
01:52:20.406 --> 01:52:22.658
- Stop!
- No!


1298
01:52:25.411 --> 01:52:27.663
- Listen to me.
- Let go.


1299
01:52:27.830 --> 01:52:30.666
- I want to die!
- Nadia!


1300
01:52:32.001 --> 01:52:35.255
- Listen.
- Leave me alone, I beg you.


1301
01:52:43.929 --> 01:52:46.015
You helped me understand..

1302
01:52:46.181 --> 01:52:51.354
My life was loathsome.
I learned to love you.


1303
01:52:52.688 --> 01:52:56.107
And now, because of the brutality
of a louse..


1304
01:52:56.108 --> 01:53:01.281
Who humiliated me in front of you
to bring us to his level.


1305
01:53:01.447 --> 01:53:04.409
All of a sudden,
nothing is the same.


1306
01:53:05.868 --> 01:53:09.955
What was beautiful and right
has become wrong.


1307
01:53:12.875 --> 01:53:16.546
We're both guilty.
Especially me.


1308
01:53:19.382 --> 01:53:22.552
- Go back to Simone.
- Are you serious?


1309
01:53:24.219 --> 01:53:26.639
Simone needs you.

1310
01:53:27.222 --> 01:53:30.059
He needs me, I know.
Then what?


1311
01:53:30.893 --> 01:53:33.020
Don't I count for anything?

1312
01:53:33.563 --> 01:53:35.315
What'll we do?

1313
01:53:37.567 --> 01:53:39.402
Help Simone.

1314
01:53:40.486 --> 01:53:42.655
This is madness!

1315
01:53:55.918 --> 01:54:02.758
We thought we were starting anew.
Instead we were only doing harm.


1316
01:54:02.925 --> 01:54:05.678
I'll go
to church for my sermons.


1317
01:54:05.928 --> 01:54:07.012
I love you.

1318
01:54:09.014 --> 01:54:12.268
You love me.
What'll become of our love?


1319
01:54:12.435 --> 01:54:14.479
Why torture me like this?

1320
01:54:18.190 --> 01:54:19.775
We must stop.

1321
01:54:23.696 --> 01:54:25.114
It's not possible.

1322
01:54:26.115 --> 01:54:28.243
You can't mean that, Rocco.

1323
01:54:32.372 --> 01:54:35.708
If you do you'll regret it..

1324
01:54:36.959 --> 01:54:38.878
And it'll be too late.

1325
01:54:39.545 --> 01:54:43.132
I hate you! Hate you!
I hate you! I hate you!


1326
01:54:55.728 --> 01:54:57.146
No luck tonight.

1327
01:55:00.232 --> 01:55:01.401
The house wins.

1328
01:55:01.484 --> 01:55:04.987
Place your bets. Your bets.
Rien ne va plus.


1329
01:55:08.324 --> 01:55:10.660
One card.

1330
01:55:16.249 --> 01:55:17.999
Let's hope this time, huh?

1331
01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.002
The bank pays. Pass.

1332
01:55:27.427 --> 01:55:29.845
Quiet! We're playing here.

1333
01:55:33.098 --> 01:55:35.935
And me,
like an idiot, up there,..


1334
01:55:36.269 --> 01:55:42.358
With Madonnas and Saints,
crying away, in despair.


1335
01:55:43.526 --> 01:55:44.652
What a bummer!

1336
01:55:44.860 --> 01:55:47.947
Poor Nadia.
You'll get over it.


1337
01:55:48.197 --> 01:55:49.614
Forget all about it.

1338
01:55:49.615 --> 01:55:50.950
Forget, right!

1339
01:55:59.542 --> 01:56:00.542
I'm hurting.

1340
01:56:03.463 --> 01:56:06.757
And there's someone hurting
just like me.


1341
01:56:11.136 --> 01:56:15.057
Look who's here! He's
the cause of all our hurts.


1342
01:56:16.309 --> 01:56:17.768
The "real" victim!

1343
01:56:21.481 --> 01:56:22.564
What's with her?

1344
01:56:22.565 --> 01:56:24.442
We brought him to ruin.

1345
01:56:24.567 --> 01:56:27.820
We brought him to ruin,
can you imagine?


1346
01:56:28.237 --> 01:56:29.905
I beg your pardon.

1347
01:56:30.823 --> 01:56:32.074
You crazy?

1348
01:56:34.076 --> 01:56:35.077
I'm crazy...

1349
01:56:37.079 --> 01:56:38.664
must be!

1350
01:56:39.249 --> 01:56:41.667
But it's your brother's idea.

1351
01:56:42.585 --> 01:56:46.005
Yes, Rocco, his brother.

1352
01:56:46.672 --> 01:56:48.758
Know what he said?

1353
01:56:49.342 --> 01:56:53.263
To go back to him,
to console him.


1354
01:56:54.514 --> 01:56:56.849
He's unhappy, the poor thing.

1355
01:56:57.600 --> 01:57:01.687
He can't make it alone.
He needs someone's help.


1356
01:57:02.438 --> 01:57:06.609
I don't want trouble.
If she's drunk, take her away.


1357
01:57:07.693 --> 01:57:10.112
I beg your pardon? Ask nicely.

1358
01:57:10.363 --> 01:57:13.241
I'm a lady,
so treat me accordingly.


1359
01:57:13.783 --> 01:57:17.578
- You can't just give me the boot.
- Calm down.


1360
01:57:19.289 --> 01:57:21.956
- Hear him? Kicking me out.
- Calm down.


1361
01:57:21.957 --> 01:57:24.543
It's not the first time
someone's tried that.


1362
01:57:24.544 --> 01:57:27.713
- You keep your mouth shut!
- Calm down.


1363
01:57:29.131 --> 01:57:31.634
So you're coming back?

1364
01:57:32.134 --> 01:57:34.136
I'm ready if you are.

1365
01:57:34.554 --> 01:57:36.221
Back with you, never!

1366
01:57:37.723 --> 01:57:38.808
I hate you.

1367
01:57:39.642 --> 01:57:41.060
I hate you.

1368
01:57:41.894 --> 01:57:42.978
Never!

1369
01:57:44.063 --> 01:57:46.065
I'd rather die first!

1370
01:57:47.149 --> 01:57:50.985
I warn you, come near me
and I'll spit in your face.


1371
01:57:50.986 --> 01:57:53.905
In front of everybody
I'll spit in your face.


1372
01:57:53.906 --> 01:57:55.575
Cut it out, you two!

1373
01:57:56.659 --> 01:58:00.413
- Stop making trouble, both of you!
- Let go.


1374
01:58:01.163 --> 01:58:03.082
Don't come any closer.

1375
01:58:07.753 --> 01:58:10.298
- What do you want?
- Come here.


1376
01:58:10.673 --> 01:58:12.758
- Let go!
- Come on.


1377
01:58:13.593 --> 01:58:16.011
Sure, with Rocco's permission.

1378
01:58:16.178 --> 01:58:17.597
Let's go.

1379
01:58:18.681 --> 01:58:20.850
For an hour or forever?

1380
01:58:21.601 --> 01:58:24.186
- Even forever.
- Why not?


1381
01:58:26.272 --> 01:58:29.567
You or someone else,
makes no difference.


1382
01:58:30.610 --> 01:58:31.944
Let's go.

1383
01:58:32.194 --> 01:58:33.696
Let's go, huh!

1384
01:58:38.033 --> 01:58:39.285
Come on!

1385
01:58:40.536 --> 01:58:43.456
No, forget it,
I never loved you.


1386
01:59:33.005 --> 01:59:35.007
Seconds out.

1387
01:59:36.592 --> 01:59:40.513
Keep your guard up
and hit his bad eye..


1388
01:59:41.180 --> 01:59:42.932
Where the cut is.

1389
01:59:46.269 --> 01:59:48.938
Bash him! Understand?

1390
01:59:49.104 --> 01:59:51.607
Round three. Last round.

1391
02:00:49.915 --> 02:00:52.585
Rocco! Rocco!

1392
02:01:25.117 --> 02:01:27.036
Your attention, please.

1393
02:01:28.788 --> 02:01:32.875
By a knockout,
the winner: Rocco Parondi,..


1394
02:01:33.376 --> 02:01:36.045
Representing the Italian team.

1395
02:01:39.632 --> 02:01:42.468
Rocco! Rocco!

1396
02:02:22.342 --> 02:02:24.594
You all right?

1397
02:02:41.611 --> 02:02:43.946
Are you okay, Rocco?

1398
02:02:44.947 --> 02:02:47.116
Winning came easy, Ciro,..

1399
02:02:48.284 --> 02:02:50.953
Because I wasn't fighting him..

1400
02:02:52.872 --> 02:02:57.126
But someone who drew
out of me the hatred..


1401
02:02:57.793 --> 02:03:02.047
That has grown inside me
without my knowing.


1402
02:03:04.967 --> 02:03:06.469
It's a bad feeling.

1403
02:03:08.220 --> 02:03:10.306
You can't imagine how bad.

1404
02:03:12.224 --> 02:03:16.812
How's that possible, Rocco?
There's nothing bad in you.


1405
02:03:17.813 --> 02:03:19.815
Come on, Rocco, cheer up!

1406
02:03:20.232 --> 02:03:21.817
You'll be great.

1407
02:03:22.151 --> 02:03:24.820
A real champion.

1408
02:03:49.094 --> 02:03:52.432
Ciro, that's enough,
my Father's waiting.


1409
02:03:53.683 --> 02:03:57.602
- Come on.
- Ciro, that's enough, my Father's waiting..


1410
02:03:57.603 --> 02:03:59.854
I have to tell you something.

1411
02:03:59.855 --> 02:04:00.856
What is it?

1412
02:04:01.607 --> 02:04:03.276
- You love me?
- Yes.


1413
02:04:04.193 --> 02:04:05.611
Give me a kiss?

1414
02:04:06.362 --> 02:04:07.447
Here, Ciro?

1415
02:04:09.282 --> 02:04:10.283
Why not?

1416
02:04:26.215 --> 02:04:27.383
Papa's waiting.

1417
02:04:29.635 --> 02:04:33.556
Hi, Papa.
What fun!


1418
02:04:34.056 --> 02:04:36.808
- Hi! - Good evening.
- You told him?


1419
02:04:36.809 --> 02:04:41.647
I forgot. Papa said to come
over tomorrow night.


1420
02:04:42.231 --> 02:04:44.983
He wants to know
if our intentions are serious.


1421
02:04:44.984 --> 02:04:46.651
I can answer right now.

1422
02:04:46.652 --> 02:04:50.573
No, tomorrow. Let's give him
a chance to escape.


1423
02:04:50.823 --> 02:04:53.659
- Ciao, Ciro.
- See you tomorrow...


1424
02:04:53.826 --> 02:04:56.829
- Yeah, a nice boy.
- Ciro!


1425
02:04:58.748 --> 02:05:00.999
- You won't go back to the dance hall?
- Of course not.


1426
02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:05.129
Go straight home, huh?
No dancing without me, ever!


1427
02:05:06.339 --> 02:05:08.591
Get in, it's cold.

1428
02:05:11.427 --> 02:05:12.427
Ciao!

1429
02:05:14.847 --> 02:05:16.349
Ciao, Franca.

1430
02:05:25.608 --> 02:05:27.692
- Good evening.
- Good evening.


1431
02:05:27.693 --> 02:05:29.529
You're the fourth, huh?

1432
02:05:29.779 --> 02:05:32.282
We've already met.
Remember?


1433
02:05:33.616 --> 02:05:37.537
She's Simone's woman.
He's back too. He's inside.


1434
02:05:38.037 --> 02:05:41.624
- Ciro, come here a minute!
- Coming, Mamma.


1435
02:05:46.546 --> 02:05:49.715
No knives in this house?

1436
02:05:49.965 --> 02:05:51.301
Here they are.

1437
02:05:55.721 --> 02:05:58.890
Here's the cure
for your brother's hangover.


1438
02:05:58.891 --> 02:06:01.477
Ciro, my son...

1439
02:06:03.228 --> 02:06:06.732
Rest now. We'll settle
everything tomorrow.


1440
02:06:07.149 --> 02:06:09.569
Tomorrow?
There's no tomorrow.


1441
02:06:09.652 --> 02:06:13.155
Tomorrow?
There is no tomorrow.


1442
02:06:15.074 --> 02:06:20.996
Ciro, my dear son, tell me:
Is all that's happening my fault?


1443
02:06:21.581 --> 02:06:27.253
Taking my strong, handsome
sons here to better themselves,..


1444
02:06:27.420 --> 02:06:31.005
And not toil a thankless land
like their father..


1445
02:06:31.006 --> 02:06:34.175
Who died a thousand times
before giving up...


1446
02:06:34.176 --> 02:06:36.679
You did well!

1447
02:06:37.012 --> 02:06:41.182
Your father couldn't bring
himself to leave the land.


1448
02:06:41.183 --> 02:06:44.854
But during the 25 years
we spent together..


1449
02:06:45.104 --> 02:06:49.484
I thought of nothing but
leaving, leaving, leaving...


1450
02:06:49.609 --> 02:06:53.779
I wanted it for Vincenzo,
Simone, Rocco and for you.


1451
02:06:54.196 --> 02:06:58.701
Nothing seemed beautiful there.
That world was so small.


1452
02:06:58.784 --> 02:07:02.455
Here I feel
as If I could touch the sky.


1453
02:07:03.373 --> 02:07:08.794
People on the street called me
"Madam", imagine...


1454
02:07:10.129 --> 02:07:13.549
me, "Madam",
here, in this big city.


1455
02:07:13.716 --> 02:07:15.968
Thanks to my wonderful boys.

1456
02:07:16.969 --> 02:07:19.722
But now, everything's gone wrong

1457
02:07:20.723 --> 02:07:25.226
Rocco's left home, and acts
as though a curse is on him.


1458
02:07:25.227 --> 02:07:29.732
And Simone, my dear Simone,
lives with a whore!


1459
02:07:30.483 --> 02:07:32.735
- Want some?
- No.


1460
02:07:33.736 --> 02:07:36.739
Yeah, it's pretty revolting.

1461
02:07:40.075 --> 02:07:41.661
Don't cry.

1462
02:07:47.750 --> 02:07:49.669
I'll think of something.

1463
02:07:56.342 --> 02:07:57.760
Leave it to me.

1464
02:08:06.769 --> 02:08:09.272
I must talk to my brother.

1465
02:08:15.528 --> 02:08:19.824
You're irresponsible.
A little respect for our mother.


1466
02:08:21.867 --> 02:08:25.162
Look, I'm fed up
with all your preaching!


1467
02:08:28.291 --> 02:08:31.877
This is my house too,
and I bring who I want.


1468
02:08:34.964 --> 02:08:37.925
I already
owe the hotel 60,000 liras.


1469
02:08:39.134 --> 02:08:41.053
Wanna pay it?

1470
02:08:42.972 --> 02:08:45.057
Anyway, there's room here.

1471
02:08:45.725 --> 02:08:49.729
Rocco's with Vincenzo.
That gives us an extra bed.


1472
02:08:50.313 --> 02:08:51.481
Any objections?

1473
02:08:53.566 --> 02:08:57.278
- Leave me alone.
- We'll discuss it tomorrow.


1474
02:08:57.820 --> 02:09:01.741
We'll discuss it
when I feel like it.


1475
02:09:03.826 --> 02:09:05.995
Don't blame me now.

1476
02:09:07.747 --> 02:09:11.917
The only one who's losing out is me.

1477
02:09:12.918 --> 02:09:14.879
Let's get that straight.

1478
02:09:16.756 --> 02:09:19.342
You got a cigarette?

1479
02:09:19.509 --> 02:09:20.926
I don't smoke.

1480
02:09:21.511 --> 02:09:24.012
He doesn't smoke.
I should've known.


1481
02:09:24.013 --> 02:09:28.768
He doesn't smoke, but I do
and I'm out of cigarettes.


1482
02:09:32.522 --> 02:09:36.526
Poor Mamma, she even has
to make that woman's bed.


1483
02:09:38.944 --> 02:09:42.615
I know
I'm more ashamed than you.


1484
02:09:44.950 --> 02:09:46.994
Whether brothers or not..

1485
02:09:48.704 --> 02:09:53.876
We're seeds taken from
the same sack meant to bear fruit.


1486
02:09:54.710 --> 02:09:57.880
A seed gone bad must be weeded out.

1487
02:10:00.132 --> 02:10:03.052
Like we did
when cleaning lentils.


1488
02:10:04.470 --> 02:10:07.306
And all this
isn't good for young Luca.


1489
02:10:07.307 --> 02:10:11.644
Simone hasn't changed,
he's just demoralized.


1490
02:10:12.227 --> 02:10:17.733
His pride has been wounded
Let me try again, just once more.


1491
02:10:18.901 --> 02:10:20.403
I know what to do.

1492
02:10:22.572 --> 02:10:27.243
Cerri's very interested in me.
I'll fight for him,..


1493
02:10:28.160 --> 02:10:32.080
He knows I might leave
if he lets Simone fight too.


1494
02:10:32.081 --> 02:10:34.334
I wouldn't do it if...

1495
02:10:34.500 --> 02:10:37.837
Let me try, I'll manage somehow.

1496
02:10:38.588 --> 02:10:39.589
Do it for me.

1497
02:10:46.762 --> 02:10:49.432
If only
we had never left home...


1498
02:10:51.684 --> 02:10:56.856
But it was our destiny
yours and mine,..


1499
02:10:58.941 --> 02:11:00.109
And Simone's.

1500
02:11:00.276 --> 02:11:04.029
Imagine all the misery
had we remained there.


1501
02:11:04.780 --> 02:11:06.866
But we'd still be close.

1502
02:11:07.283 --> 02:11:10.119
Rocco!
We're here to work out!


1503
02:11:10.286 --> 02:11:11.287
I'm coming.

1504
02:11:17.126 --> 02:11:19.879
I'll never understand you.

1505
02:11:20.380 --> 02:11:21.964
I know.

1506
02:11:34.394 --> 02:11:35.895
See him?

1507
02:11:36.729 --> 02:11:39.315
That man in the car?

1508
02:11:39.482 --> 02:11:43.569
- Tell him I'll be waiting at the bar.
- All right.


1509
02:11:53.413 --> 02:11:54.413
A cognac.

1510
02:12:05.341 --> 02:12:07.843
No fight? You're scared?

1511
02:12:09.178 --> 02:12:11.096
I don't feel good.

1512
02:12:11.264 --> 02:12:13.182
Then why hang out here?

1513
02:12:14.850 --> 02:12:16.185
Snap out of it!

1514
02:12:17.687 --> 02:12:21.274
How about a drink in a nice
quiet place, huh?


1515
02:12:25.611 --> 02:12:26.611
All right.

1516
02:12:28.113 --> 02:12:30.866
Simone, it's late.

1517
02:12:31.116 --> 02:12:33.077
Go away.
Leave me alone!


1518
02:12:40.460 --> 02:12:41.752
Got a cigarette?

1519
02:12:50.886 --> 02:12:52.722
These are for later.

1520
02:12:56.141 --> 02:12:57.142
Feel better?

1521
02:13:00.062 --> 02:13:01.814
I will, far from here.

1522
02:13:02.482 --> 02:13:03.774
Got the jitters?

1523
02:13:04.734 --> 02:13:09.447
It happens when you realize
that punches ruin your profile.


1524
02:13:11.156 --> 02:13:12.367
Where we going?

1525
02:13:14.244 --> 02:13:15.495
Your place?

1526
02:13:16.496 --> 02:13:19.749
I was sure you'd ask me one day.

1527
02:13:19.915 --> 02:13:21.876
- How much?
- 200 liras.


1528
02:13:24.337 --> 02:13:25.337
Thank you.

1529
02:13:25.921 --> 02:13:28.674
I see
your courage is coming back.


1530
02:13:31.344 --> 02:13:33.178
Better late than never.

1531
02:13:41.354 --> 02:13:43.773
You like my place?

1532
02:13:47.192 --> 02:13:49.111
Come in, don't worry.

1533
02:13:51.531 --> 02:13:54.284
It's your first time here?

1534
02:14:01.957 --> 02:14:03.208
Feeling better?

1535
02:14:05.961 --> 02:14:06.962
Calmer now?

1536
02:14:37.910 --> 02:14:38.910
Sit down.

1537
02:14:56.346 --> 02:14:58.848
I need money.

1538
02:15:01.183 --> 02:15:02.183
Lots.

1539
02:15:03.603 --> 02:15:05.062
I understood that.

1540
02:15:15.698 --> 02:15:18.200
It's not the first time, is it?

1541
02:15:21.537 --> 02:15:22.788
The Champ!

1542
02:15:24.540 --> 02:15:29.379
I predicted it.
You couldn't last.


1543
02:15:31.547 --> 02:15:32.673
And to think..

1544
02:15:35.801 --> 02:15:39.804
When I first saw you
at "The Lombard Club", you were...


1545
02:15:39.805 --> 02:15:43.559
An Apollo.
A real Apollo.


1546
02:15:53.819 --> 02:15:55.112
You're through..

1547
02:15:55.821 --> 02:15:58.324
As a boxer.
And as a man.


1548
02:15:58.574 --> 02:16:02.912
Only somebody like me
can use a wreck like you.


1549
02:16:03.496 --> 02:16:04.830
I need money.

1550
02:16:05.248 --> 02:16:07.082
To pay for your whores?

1551
02:16:10.002 --> 02:16:11.254
That's one way..

1552
02:16:12.087 --> 02:16:14.424
To save face, isn't it?

1553
02:16:16.008 --> 02:16:17.343
Let me drink.

1554
02:16:18.093 --> 02:16:19.845
Guzzle it.

1555
02:16:20.179 --> 02:16:22.432
Nobody's weighing you in.

1556
02:16:32.275 --> 02:16:34.402
I'll tell you straight off:

1557
02:16:36.612 --> 02:16:37.947
You're a shit!

1558
02:16:39.198 --> 02:16:40.825
Don't pull that one.

1559
02:16:42.117 --> 02:16:43.369
Not on me!

1560
02:16:43.953 --> 02:16:47.457
You can't talk
like that, understand?


1561
02:17:44.264 --> 02:17:46.432
- Ciro!
- Yeah, Ma.


1562
02:17:47.433 --> 02:17:50.353
- Come here. Hurry up.
- I'm coming.


1563
02:17:56.442 --> 02:17:57.442
What is it?

1564
02:17:57.693 --> 02:17:59.362
Get a move on!

1565
02:17:59.862 --> 02:18:03.741
- What's happened?
- They're looking for Simone.


1566
02:18:03.783 --> 02:18:08.371
It's the police.
It seems they have a warrant.


1567
02:18:08.704 --> 02:18:10.456
What's it all about?

1568
02:18:10.623 --> 02:18:13.543
Go to your room.

1569
02:18:16.546 --> 02:18:18.798
Don't worry.

1570
02:18:21.050 --> 02:18:25.555
My brother Simone
didn't come home last night.


1571
02:18:26.639 --> 02:18:29.725
He rarely sleeps here,
hardly ever.


1572
02:18:30.059 --> 02:18:32.395
- Take a look.
- Never mind.


1573
02:18:33.479 --> 02:18:35.230
Why do you want him?

1574
02:18:36.065 --> 02:18:39.319
We're here to bring him in.

1575
02:18:39.485 --> 02:18:41.862
There are charges against him.

1576
02:18:41.987 --> 02:18:43.656
That's all.

1577
02:18:44.156 --> 02:18:48.328
- I'd like to know more
- Come along.


1578
02:18:48.578 --> 02:18:50.746
Come in. I'll get dressed.

1579
02:19:04.427 --> 02:19:06.011
This is Simone?

1580
02:19:06.262 --> 02:19:09.599
Yes, my brother,
when he was still boxing.


1581
02:19:11.517 --> 02:19:13.185
I'm ready.

1582
02:19:16.689 --> 02:19:19.275
I'm going to the police station.

1583
02:19:25.365 --> 02:19:28.868
The police want him.
What'd he do? You know?


1584
02:19:30.870 --> 02:19:34.624
No, not this time,
but I can imagine.


1585
02:19:35.291 --> 02:19:36.709
He's rotten.

1586
02:19:37.460 --> 02:19:39.379
You know it's true.

1587
02:19:39.629 --> 02:19:44.467
How can you say that
about others? What nerve!


1588
02:19:44.717 --> 02:19:48.554
With you here, I'm ashamed
to show my face.


1589
02:19:49.138 --> 02:19:53.309
You allowed me to stay only
to keep Simone with you.


1590
02:19:53.559 --> 02:19:55.561
I've been rotting here!

1591
02:19:56.479 --> 02:20:00.065
No, squatting here
is what you've been doing!


1592
02:20:00.316 --> 02:20:02.151
Take your rags, and go!

1593
02:20:02.318 --> 02:20:04.737
He said he'd keep me.

1594
02:20:04.904 --> 02:20:08.741
He can't keep a woman like me.
He's a bum!


1595
02:20:08.991 --> 02:20:11.410
He can't work, can't even steal.

1596
02:20:11.411 --> 02:20:13.246
Yes, steal!

1597
02:20:14.664 --> 02:20:17.667
You whore!
You ruined him.


1598
02:20:18.418 --> 02:20:20.670
The son everybody envied.

1599
02:20:21.003 --> 02:20:24.006
When he's rid of you,..

1600
02:20:24.674 --> 02:20:29.470
He'll be his old self. May you be damned!
- Don't do that!


1601
02:20:29.679 --> 02:20:32.097
Don't worry, I'm going.

1602
02:20:34.267 --> 02:20:36.852
No, he must tell you when to go.

1603
02:20:38.521 --> 02:20:42.442
No, why should I stay?
Simone has hit the bottom.


1604
02:20:42.692 --> 02:20:45.360
That's exactly what I wanted,
I'm happy now.


1605
02:20:45.361 --> 02:20:49.448
Make Rocco understand how
useless our sacrifice was.


1606
02:20:49.449 --> 02:20:52.116
I've no desire
to tell him myself.


1607
02:20:52.117 --> 02:20:56.372
I want to go, and never see
any of you again.


1608
02:20:56.539 --> 02:20:58.791
Out! Out! Get out!

1609
02:21:03.212 --> 02:21:05.964
He thought I was afraid.
I told him:


1610
02:21:05.965 --> 02:21:09.050
"You touch that money
and I'll report you".


1611
02:21:09.051 --> 02:21:10.678
He started laughing.

1612
02:21:11.554 --> 02:21:14.474
I watched him break open
the drawer.


1613
02:21:23.733 --> 02:21:27.945
Tell them you found the money,
that you misplaced it.


1614
02:21:28.153 --> 02:21:32.157
I'll sign an IOU.
Cerri will guarantee for me.


1615
02:21:33.576 --> 02:21:36.661
You think I'd risk
going to the police..


1616
02:21:36.662 --> 02:21:40.165
For a lousy 60 or 70
thousand liras?


1617
02:21:47.590 --> 02:21:52.094
For a year now he's been
speculating on my generosity.


1618
02:21:53.263 --> 02:21:56.432
Tell me what he owes you,
and that's it!


1619
02:21:57.683 --> 02:22:01.437
It's not just the money.
I stuck my neck out..


1620
02:22:02.187 --> 02:22:04.524
Covering for him..

1621
02:22:04.690 --> 02:22:07.527
With a band of smugglers.

1622
02:22:07.777 --> 02:22:10.363
I asked you how much he owes!

1623
02:22:17.620 --> 02:22:18.621
400 thousand.

1624
02:22:31.384 --> 02:22:34.887
I'll pay with notes in 3 months.

1625
02:22:39.058 --> 02:22:41.311
You crazy?
We'll be ruined.


1626
02:22:41.894 --> 02:22:45.315
Don't count on me, I can't help.

1627
02:22:45.481 --> 02:22:50.069
Ginetta's expecting and
we've got furniture installments.


1628
02:22:52.655 --> 02:22:54.407
This concerns only me.

1629
02:22:55.074 --> 02:22:58.619
You can't, where'll you find
all that money?


1630
02:23:03.999 --> 02:23:07.253
He doesn't make sense,
you tell him.


1631
02:23:07.503 --> 02:23:11.341
I told him, I can't help.

1632
02:23:12.842 --> 02:23:15.845
I got a family, you know that.

1633
02:23:17.096 --> 02:23:20.182
You sure Cerri will guarantee
for you?


1634
02:23:23.353 --> 02:23:25.020
You ask him.

1635
02:23:55.092 --> 02:23:59.054
It's still crazy,
even if Cerri agrees.


1636
02:23:59.264 --> 02:24:01.641
How'll you pay him back?

1637
02:24:07.229 --> 02:24:11.567
He promised me good money
if I sign for 10 years.


1638
02:24:13.235 --> 02:24:17.865
We'll go to Brussels, London...
besides, what do you care?


1639
02:24:18.741 --> 02:24:20.493
Hello, is Cerri there?

1640
02:24:21.160 --> 02:24:23.371
Tell him it's Duilio.

1641
02:24:23.663 --> 02:24:25.581
You didn't want to box..

1642
02:24:25.748 --> 02:24:29.877
Yet you're ruining your life
for that delinquent.


1643
02:24:31.254 --> 02:24:32.338
Then tell me..

1644
02:24:33.673 --> 02:24:37.092
Another way to save
Simone from his fate.


1645
02:24:38.344 --> 02:24:39.804
Yes, hold on.

1646
02:24:43.140 --> 02:24:45.851
It's Cerri. He's on the line.

1647
02:24:47.227 --> 02:24:49.605
Rocco, think it over.

1648
02:24:51.399 --> 02:24:55.278
Wait. He's coming.

1649
02:25:08.458 --> 02:25:11.961
Cerri? Rocco.

1650
02:25:16.424 --> 02:25:18.718
Yes, of course. I understand.

1651
02:25:20.135 --> 02:25:21.512
Whatever you say.

1652
02:25:29.144 --> 02:25:32.314
We did what we could,
Ciro. Our conscience,..


1653
02:25:32.315 --> 02:25:33.399
Is clear.

1654
02:25:34.734 --> 02:25:39.154
When Rocco's set on something,
there's no stopping him.


1655
02:25:41.073 --> 02:25:42.367
In fact, I'm...

1656
02:25:47.622 --> 02:25:50.916
In fact, I'm accepting
your terms.


1657
02:25:53.919 --> 02:25:54.919
Agreed.

1658
02:25:59.049 --> 02:26:00.049
Alright.

1659
02:26:02.303 --> 02:26:03.888
All right, tomorrow.

1660
02:26:04.430 --> 02:26:05.556
Yes, tomorrow.

1661
02:26:08.100 --> 02:26:09.100
Fine.

1662
02:26:11.271 --> 02:26:13.606
Four, five.

1663
02:26:17.860 --> 02:26:22.532
This is for you,
but get out of Milan for a while.


1664
02:26:24.367 --> 02:26:26.619
You got no job to lose.

1665
02:26:27.328 --> 02:26:30.415
Besides, any place
is the same to you.


1666
02:26:30.956 --> 02:26:32.958
Stay out of the house!

1667
02:26:35.378 --> 02:26:38.589
Did the "Court of Brothers"
decide that?


1668
02:26:39.465 --> 02:26:42.134
- Who needs them?
- Just as well.


1669
02:26:51.143 --> 02:26:52.562
Let's make a pact.

1670
02:26:54.564 --> 02:26:58.609
Since you have money
for that bastard, Duilio,..


1671
02:27:00.403 --> 02:27:04.073
Maybe you've some "change"
for your brother.


1672
02:27:06.909 --> 02:27:09.954
200 thousand,
and I'll split for good.


1673
02:27:10.580 --> 02:27:14.207
I'll personally see you get
another 100 thousand..


1674
02:27:14.208 --> 02:27:16.419
As soon as Rocco collects.

1675
02:27:16.502 --> 02:27:20.590
He'll get another payment
after his next fight.


1676
02:27:22.091 --> 02:27:23.343
Then I'll wait.

1677
02:27:25.261 --> 02:27:27.763
We're going. Come on, Luca.

1678
02:27:28.681 --> 02:27:29.807
Let him go!

1679
02:27:32.435 --> 02:27:34.354
- No!
- Cool it.


1680
02:27:37.022 --> 02:27:38.691
I don't have measles.

1681
02:27:40.025 --> 02:27:41.986
Get off your high horse.

1682
02:27:43.779 --> 02:27:45.406
Who are you, anyway?

1683
02:27:46.115 --> 02:27:49.577
Mr. skilled worker
at the Alfa Romeo plant?


1684
02:27:50.286 --> 02:27:51.662
Some career!

1685
02:27:53.789 --> 02:27:56.376
He's even proud of it!

1686
02:27:56.709 --> 02:27:59.504
- You're pitiful.
- Get outta here!


1687
02:28:03.258 --> 02:28:05.426
- Hear that, Luca?
- Yes.


1688
02:28:05.635 --> 02:28:07.637
He said I'm pitiful.

1689
02:28:07.803 --> 02:28:09.138
Luca, let's go!

1690
02:28:40.836 --> 02:28:43.673
Rocco! Rocco!

1691
02:28:46.676 --> 02:28:47.677
He's coming.

1692
02:28:53.516 --> 02:28:55.601
Did you sleep?

1693
02:28:56.101 --> 02:28:58.020
How you feeling?

1694
02:29:01.566 --> 02:29:03.651
- Ciao, Rocco.
- Ciao.


1695
02:29:05.027 --> 02:29:06.779
How about a rubdown?

1696
02:29:08.948 --> 02:29:11.659
A light massage.
Just a quick rub.


1697
02:29:11.867 --> 02:29:15.454
- He won't feel a thing.
- Rub his legs, too.


1698
02:29:15.455 --> 02:29:18.416
- My left arm aches.
- It's nothing.


1699
02:29:18.624 --> 02:29:19.624
Simone!

1700
02:29:21.627 --> 02:29:24.297
Tickets for the fight?

1701
02:29:25.381 --> 02:29:27.300
You promised!

1702
02:29:33.556 --> 02:29:36.642
Got it in for me?
I promised nothing.


1703
02:29:36.809 --> 02:29:38.644
I'm not going either.

1704
02:29:38.811 --> 02:29:41.564
Yeah, and it's killing you.

1705
02:29:45.485 --> 02:29:48.988
Poor guy, he's not going either.

1706
02:29:49.154 --> 02:29:52.533
Ever since he quit,
boxing makes him sick.


1707
02:29:52.700 --> 02:29:57.747
You quit? You don't throw
punches anymore?


1708
02:29:58.163 --> 02:30:00.416
No, got tired of it.

1709
02:30:01.166 --> 02:30:04.253
You know the story about
the fox and sour grapes?


1710
02:30:04.254 --> 02:30:07.464
- No, I don't.
- Poor guy, he doesn't remember.


1711
02:30:07.465 --> 02:30:10.175
Then let's refresh his memory.

1712
02:30:10.510 --> 02:30:13.263
What's going on, guys?

1713
02:30:14.847 --> 02:30:17.182
- Ciao.
- Ciao, Ivo. - Ciao.


1714
02:30:18.934 --> 02:30:21.354
You want a cigarette?

1715
02:30:33.866 --> 02:30:35.284
Hey, some of us here..

1716
02:30:35.285 --> 02:30:39.955
Saw with their own eyes
how he tamed..


1717
02:30:40.540 --> 02:30:45.378
Rocco the champion.

1718
02:30:46.796 --> 02:30:49.172
Those who saw it will never
forget that night.


1719
02:30:49.173 --> 02:30:52.468
- I was there.
- But I'd like to see..


1720
02:30:52.635 --> 02:30:55.304
The brothers now
facing each other.


1721
02:30:55.305 --> 02:30:59.559
- Who'll get the brunt this time?
- That's a thought!


1722
02:31:03.896 --> 02:31:06.774
But now, we've got to stage it..

1723
02:31:06.899 --> 02:31:10.570
Over by the canal.
I heard..


1724
02:31:12.822 --> 02:31:17.743
That Nadia's working together
with a woman near Ravizza..


1725
02:31:18.244 --> 02:31:20.579
Who rents out rooms and cars.

1726
02:31:20.580 --> 02:31:23.832
"Nadia, the motorized hooker,
who does her clients.."


1727
02:31:23.833 --> 02:31:26.502
"in a car, along the canal!"

1728
02:31:27.587 --> 02:31:30.089
Ivo, are you sure?

1729
02:31:30.923 --> 02:31:33.259
Look, his ears perked up.

1730
02:31:35.761 --> 02:31:39.514
If we wanted,
we could organize another night..


1731
02:31:39.515 --> 02:31:41.225
Like before.

1732
02:31:42.184 --> 02:31:46.438
Is your brother still pining
for the motorized hooker?


1733
02:31:46.439 --> 02:31:49.942
Or does he aim higher?

1734
02:31:51.026 --> 02:31:52.987
Simone, where you going?

1735
02:31:54.029 --> 02:31:55.239
Come back here.

1736
02:31:55.865 --> 02:31:57.283
Where you going?

1737
02:31:58.534 --> 02:31:59.534
Simone!

1738
02:31:59.952 --> 02:32:01.203
Simone!

1739
02:32:03.205 --> 02:32:06.292
What a crowd!
All the champs are here!


1740
02:32:08.544 --> 02:32:10.380
You show them, Rocco!

1741
02:32:35.446 --> 02:32:38.616
Give me some water. I'm parched.

1742
02:32:38.908 --> 02:32:40.993
No, it bloats the stomach.

1743
02:32:41.911 --> 02:32:43.871
Then give me some lemon.

1744
02:34:07.037 --> 02:34:08.581
Well...?

1745
02:34:09.374 --> 02:34:10.833
What is it?

1746
02:34:12.377 --> 02:34:14.754
Money? You want money?

1747
02:34:16.088 --> 02:34:18.633
I haven't any.
See, it's empty.


1748
02:34:18.841 --> 02:34:21.801
- I'm not interested.
- I don't want...


1749
02:34:21.802 --> 02:34:25.180
You can't say no.
Come back to me.


1750
02:34:25.431 --> 02:34:28.351
With you I can start over again.

1751
02:34:28.684 --> 02:34:29.977
- Us two?
- Yes.


1752
02:34:30.019 --> 02:34:31.686
- Together again?
- Yes.


1753
02:34:31.687 --> 02:34:33.606
Impossible. Go, go away!

1754
02:34:33.689 --> 02:34:35.608
- Nadia!
- Go away!


1755
02:34:40.195 --> 02:34:41.196
Help!

1756
02:34:45.034 --> 02:34:49.121
- Help!
- Nadia!


1757
02:34:52.792 --> 02:34:54.710
Wait! Don't shout!

1758
02:34:54.877 --> 02:34:56.962
Sir! Don't leave me.

1759
02:34:57.129 --> 02:34:59.299
Don't leave me alone!

1760
02:35:00.550 --> 02:35:03.218
Nadia, cover yourself,
it's cold.


1761
02:35:04.554 --> 02:35:08.599
Don't shout. Why are you
shivering? You're afraid?


1762
02:35:09.224 --> 02:35:12.060
Look how I'm shivering.
Don't be afraid.


1763
02:35:12.061 --> 02:35:14.564
I'm not afraid, leave me alone!

1764
02:35:14.647 --> 02:35:16.816
Honey, no! Nadia!

1765
02:35:26.158 --> 02:35:28.453
Why doesn't he cover himself?

1766
02:35:28.578 --> 02:35:30.830
He's bleeding again.

1767
02:35:31.706 --> 02:35:33.749
Get that left up!

1768
02:35:35.335 --> 02:35:37.795
Cover yourself!

1769
02:35:38.796 --> 02:35:41.090
Cover up, it's cold.

1770
02:35:42.049 --> 02:35:45.645
I made you suffer.
Say it, my love...


1771
02:35:47.011 --> 02:35:49.763
You've no idea how much I hate you.

1772
02:35:49.764 --> 02:35:51.683
You're a beast.

1773
02:35:52.850 --> 02:35:56.521
Everything you touch
becomes foul,..


1774
02:35:56.646 --> 02:35:57.646
Vulgar.

1775
02:36:00.024 --> 02:36:02.444
I hope never to see you again.

1776
02:36:02.694 --> 02:36:04.779
Or hear of you again.

1777
02:36:06.781 --> 02:36:10.577
You ruined the only beautiful
thing of my life.


1778
02:36:11.077 --> 02:36:12.704
You! You criminal!

1779
02:36:15.790 --> 02:36:19.294
I spit in your face all
the loathing I feel.


1780
02:36:22.547 --> 02:36:24.466
Do what you want now.

1781
02:36:25.383 --> 02:36:27.385
I don't care anymore.

1782
02:38:14.742 --> 02:38:17.078
I don't want to die!

1783
02:39:26.105 --> 02:39:28.983
"The winner:
Rocco Parondi!"


1784
02:39:51.756 --> 02:39:55.843
Boy, I was scared when he
clipped you. Did it hurt?


1785
02:39:56.928 --> 02:40:01.348
For a while I couldn't see him.
It was like shadow boxing.


1786
02:40:01.349 --> 02:40:05.185
You could have come too, Mamma.
It wouldn't have scared you.


1787
02:40:05.186 --> 02:40:08.105
- You happy?
- Delighted.


1788
02:40:08.440 --> 02:40:13.069
- To the future champion of Italy!
- And the world!


1789
02:40:13.945 --> 02:40:17.198
I'll be truly happy the day..

1790
02:40:17.324 --> 02:40:20.701
When all my sons
reunite around this table..


1791
02:40:20.702 --> 02:40:23.496
Like the five fingers
of my hand.


1792
02:40:24.706 --> 02:40:29.961
Drink up
to the health of my Rocco.


1793
02:40:30.545 --> 02:40:31.963
To your success.

1794
02:40:32.630 --> 02:40:34.632
Some sparkling wine!

1795
02:40:34.966 --> 02:40:38.386
We must celebrate.
And you, Vincenzo,..


1796
02:40:38.636 --> 02:40:43.266
Have to make a nice toast.
- Stand up, Vincenzo!


1797
02:40:50.732 --> 02:40:53.485
Maria!
Signora Lucia! Come along!


1798
02:40:53.735 --> 02:40:56.153
The whole neighborhood is out!

1799
02:40:56.488 --> 02:40:58.490
Come in, come in.

1800
02:40:58.990 --> 02:41:03.578
Come on, everybody.

1801
02:41:07.665 --> 02:41:11.085
Go on, Rocco!
Go on! Your health!


1802
02:41:16.090 --> 02:41:17.800
Your health!

1803
02:41:25.433 --> 02:41:27.852
Come in.

1804
02:41:29.145 --> 02:41:30.938
Have a seat.

1805
02:41:35.943 --> 02:41:37.862
Make yourselves at home.

1806
02:41:43.117 --> 02:41:44.118
Quiet...

1807
02:41:45.287 --> 02:41:48.290
Vincenzo is going to make
a toast.


1808
02:41:48.790 --> 02:41:51.668
- Go on, Vincenzo!
- What can I say?


1809
02:41:54.086 --> 02:41:55.129
Let's see...

1810
02:41:59.634 --> 02:42:03.137
"Before I lose this rhyme,
let me think,.."


1811
02:42:04.806 --> 02:42:07.892
"bottoms up,
with a sparkling drink!"


1812
02:42:08.476 --> 02:42:10.562
Vincenzo, that was lovely.

1813
02:42:12.564 --> 02:42:15.483
"This wine, so fine
and wonderful.."


1814
02:42:16.484 --> 02:42:18.653
"I drink to your health."

1815
02:42:19.406 --> 02:42:23.199
Shame on you, Ciro!
They'd have shot you back home.


1816
02:42:23.200 --> 02:42:25.077
He's changed.

1817
02:42:25.287 --> 02:42:27.663
He's become
citified like Ginetta.


1818
02:42:27.664 --> 02:42:30.667
- It's your turn, Rocco.
- Forget it!


1819
02:42:33.628 --> 02:42:36.631
- No way!
- Come on..


1820
02:42:37.006 --> 02:42:40.092
All right,
everybody outside, let's go.


1821
02:42:42.595 --> 02:42:44.847
Thank you, thank you!

1822
02:42:49.519 --> 02:42:51.938
"This glass I raise.."

1823
02:42:52.188 --> 02:42:54.607
"and drink to your health.."

1824
02:42:57.569 --> 02:43:02.282
"hoping you're all happy
to share in our wealth."


1825
02:43:08.079 --> 02:43:11.958
Quiet, just a moment.

1826
02:43:13.460 --> 02:43:16.463
I thought somebody rang
the doorbell.


1827
02:43:16.546 --> 02:43:19.757
- Go take a look, I'm certain.
- No, Ma.


1828
02:43:25.054 --> 02:43:27.222
No, Ma, there's nobody there.

1829
02:43:27.223 --> 02:43:28.808
- No one?
- No.


1830
02:43:29.642 --> 02:43:30.643
No one.

1831
02:43:30.977 --> 02:43:35.147
Finish your toast. Let's see
if you're better at it.


1832
02:43:45.492 --> 02:43:49.412
No one's better, Ciro.
I'm not better than you.


1833
02:43:49.871 --> 02:43:52.415
What I'd like to toast..

1834
02:43:58.338 --> 02:44:02.216
Is the day, still far off,
when I'll be able..


1835
02:44:04.176 --> 02:44:05.845
To go back home.

1836
02:44:08.014 --> 02:44:10.767
If I can't, I hope..

1837
02:44:11.643 --> 02:44:15.772
One of us
will one day return to our land.


1838
02:44:19.901 --> 02:44:21.278
Maybe you.

1839
02:44:22.779 --> 02:44:24.864
I'd go with you.

1840
02:44:25.448 --> 02:44:31.120
Remember, Luca, ours is the land
of the olive tree,..


1841
02:44:33.290 --> 02:44:37.585
The moon and rainbows...

1842
02:44:43.925 --> 02:44:46.010
Do you remember, Vincenzo?

1843
02:44:46.636 --> 02:44:51.057
Before building a house,
the head mason threw a brick..


1844
02:44:53.059 --> 02:44:57.229
At the shadow
of the first person who happened by.


1845
02:44:57.730 --> 02:44:58.730
Why?

1846
02:45:03.320 --> 02:45:05.405
As a token of sacrifice..

1847
02:45:06.573 --> 02:45:09.742
To have the house come up solid.

1848
02:45:31.264 --> 02:45:33.391
This time someone did ring.

1849
02:45:34.851 --> 02:45:37.854
Wait, I'll go.

1850
02:46:16.893 --> 02:46:19.812
I knew it. My heart said
it was you.


1851
02:46:20.313 --> 02:46:24.484
I'm happy now. Come on!
Your brothers are all here.


1852
02:46:24.651 --> 02:46:26.319
Come on!

1853
02:46:37.247 --> 02:46:39.332
Have you eaten anything?

1854
02:46:40.250 --> 02:46:42.502
I'll heat something for you.

1855
02:46:42.669 --> 02:46:44.504
Tell me what you want.

1856
02:46:56.933 --> 02:46:59.519
- What now?
- Ciro, don't!


1857
02:46:59.644 --> 02:47:02.730
I have to ask you to leave.
I'm sorry.


1858
02:47:03.648 --> 02:47:05.317
What's wrong, Simone?

1859
02:47:06.818 --> 02:47:09.153
What's wrong?
I was so happy.


1860
02:47:09.446 --> 02:47:12.532
Tell her to shut up. Tell her!

1861
02:47:16.202 --> 02:47:19.331
- Come, we have to talk.
- I know...


1862
02:47:21.291 --> 02:47:23.710
But in front of everybody!

1863
02:47:24.544 --> 02:47:26.963
No! To me, only to me.

1864
02:47:31.301 --> 02:47:32.885
Only to me.

1865
02:47:35.221 --> 02:47:37.098
Speak up!

1866
02:47:37.640 --> 02:47:41.644
I'm not here because you won.
I don't give a damn.


1867
02:47:41.894 --> 02:47:44.564
I need money.
I need it now!


1868
02:47:44.897 --> 02:47:48.318
- We made a pact!
- Get out, Ciro!


1869
02:47:53.740 --> 02:47:59.329
Come to me for whatever
you need, understand?


1870
02:48:00.162 --> 02:48:01.331
Only to me.

1871
02:48:05.585 --> 02:48:07.670
You're hurt.
What is this?


1872
02:48:09.756 --> 02:48:12.259
- It's blood.
- Blood?


1873
02:48:15.345 --> 02:48:17.639
She kept hanging on to me.

1874
02:48:17.764 --> 02:48:22.685
- I couldn't shake her off. She didn't want to die!
- No!


1875
02:48:22.894 --> 02:48:29.276
- Simone!
- I killed her.


1876
02:48:29.692 --> 02:48:31.611
No!

1877
02:48:39.035 --> 02:48:43.456
Don't worry, no one saw me.

1878
02:48:47.377 --> 02:48:50.797
- It's all over.
- No!


1879
02:48:51.881 --> 02:48:53.883
You happy now, Champ?

1880
02:48:54.884 --> 02:48:57.053
Isn't that what you wanted?

1881
02:49:02.058 --> 02:49:05.770
It's my fault, I know.
My fault!


1882
02:49:11.934 --> 02:49:13.936
Is that blood?
It's blood!


1883
02:49:14.354 --> 02:49:15.980
- No, mamma...
- What happened?


1884
02:49:16.814 --> 02:49:18.816
- Mamma, don't go there.
- Mamma, please.


1885
02:49:19.108 --> 02:49:21.027
Where is all this blood?

1886
02:49:22.404 --> 02:49:23.613
- Let me go!
- Mamma...


1887
02:49:24.322 --> 02:49:28.368
- don't go there, please.
- Mamma, don't.


1888
02:49:32.580 --> 02:49:35.250
My boy! Simone, my son!

1889
02:49:44.426 --> 02:49:45.677
Rocco...

1890
02:49:50.390 --> 02:49:53.768
I left her there,
down by the water.


1891
02:49:56.937 --> 02:50:01.025
It's all over, 
Rocco, all over.

1892
02:50:14.622 --> 02:50:15.831
Mamma...

1893
02:50:26.259 --> 02:50:31.306
Jealousy, that's the reason.
It blinded him!


1894
02:50:31.597 --> 02:50:36.143
- Turn yourself in!
- He's your brother! - Unfortunately!


1895
02:50:36.352 --> 02:50:39.397
I don't believe
in the justice of men.


1896
02:50:39.605 --> 02:50:41.815
It's not for us to judge him,
but to help him,..


1897
02:50:41.816 --> 02:50:43.859
To save him.

1898
02:50:45.194 --> 02:50:47.613
I'll take care of everything.

1899
02:50:47.780 --> 02:50:50.032
That's not helping him!

1900
02:50:50.283 --> 02:50:53.077
- What happened?
- Where you going?


1901
02:50:54.620 --> 02:50:56.621
- What is it?
- I know what I'm doing.


1902
02:50:56.622 --> 02:50:57.623
It's useless!

1903
02:50:59.417 --> 02:51:01.877
He got rid of that curse!

1904
02:51:02.127 --> 02:51:04.129
Have you gone crazy too?

1905
02:51:04.297 --> 02:51:08.133
Shame on you,
turning on your own Mother!


1906
02:51:09.635 --> 02:51:14.014
Christ will regret
the suffering he visited upon us!


1907
02:51:14.307 --> 02:51:15.891
Don't curse!

1908
02:51:18.644 --> 02:51:20.313
It serves no purpose.

1909
02:51:20.896 --> 02:51:24.899
We're no longer in God's grace.
We're our own enemies.


1910
02:51:24.900 --> 02:51:26.944
We've all become enemies.

1911
02:51:28.571 --> 02:51:31.407
Why curse? We're all to blame.

1912
02:51:31.574 --> 02:51:33.868
We must pay for our faults.

1913
02:51:34.327 --> 02:51:37.121
- Ciro's gone...!
- Ciro!


1914
02:51:38.831 --> 02:51:40.124
Wait!

1915
02:51:43.503 --> 02:51:45.838
- Ciro!
- Ciro!


1916
02:51:57.433 --> 02:51:58.893
Stop!

1917
02:52:00.770 --> 02:52:03.147
For Papa's sake, don't do it!

1918
02:52:03.439 --> 02:52:04.940
- Ciro!
- Ciro!


1919
02:52:27.713 --> 02:52:29.549
There's no hope now.

1920
02:52:59.078 --> 02:53:01.163
Well? What is it?

1921
02:53:02.832 --> 02:53:05.668
They took him away this morning.

1922
02:53:06.336 --> 02:53:08.546
They found him on the roof..

1923
02:53:08.671 --> 02:53:11.341
Hiding behind the water tanks.

1924
02:53:13.509 --> 02:53:15.595
He spent 3 nights there.

1925
02:53:17.096 --> 02:53:20.433
Satisfied?
You wanted to turn him in.


1926
02:53:23.353 --> 02:53:26.356
You're the big shot
of the house now.


1927
02:53:26.856 --> 02:53:31.276
When you're older you'll
realize how unfair you've been.


1928
02:53:31.277 --> 02:53:33.946
How unfair
you've all been to me.


1929
02:53:34.029 --> 02:53:36.907
No one loved Simone
more than I did.


1930
02:53:41.161 --> 02:53:44.081
I was a kid when we left home,..

1931
02:53:44.206 --> 02:53:48.209
And it was Simone, not
Vincenzo who made me understand,..


1932
02:53:48.210 --> 02:53:53.048
That in our home town
we were beasts of burden,..


1933
02:53:54.049 --> 02:53:57.136
Confined to work
and blind obedience.


1934
02:54:00.139 --> 02:54:03.726
We are not slaves,
he said, but we must not..


1935
02:54:04.101 --> 02:54:06.604
Neglect our responsibilities.

1936
02:54:07.313 --> 02:54:09.315
But he forgot all that.

1937
02:54:10.275 --> 02:54:13.778
And, in so doing, ended up
the way he did,..


1938
02:54:14.445 --> 02:54:18.324
Ruining himself,
and bringing shame on us all.


1939
02:54:19.992 --> 02:54:24.580
He hurt Rocco, and you too,
our youngest brother.


1940
02:54:25.665 --> 02:54:27.833
Simone once had good roots.

1941
02:54:29.126 --> 02:54:31.546
But he let weeds overtake him.

1942
02:54:31.837 --> 02:54:35.925
Even Rocco's goodness
and generosity are misplaced.


1943
02:54:38.428 --> 02:54:42.473
Rocco's a saint, but what
can he do in this world?


1944
02:54:43.349 --> 02:54:45.435
He won't defend himself.

1945
02:54:46.519 --> 02:54:48.521
He's so forgiving.

1946
02:54:49.522 --> 02:54:52.024
But one mustn't always forgive.

1947
02:55:00.950 --> 02:55:04.287
If Rocco goes back,
I want to go with him.


1948
02:55:08.874 --> 02:55:11.918
I doubt he'll see
our home town again.


1949
02:55:11.919 --> 02:55:13.796
You might, some day.

1950
02:55:14.297 --> 02:55:17.382
But what do you think
you'll find there?


1951
02:55:17.383 --> 02:55:19.677
Things will change there too.

1952
02:55:20.636 --> 02:55:24.557
Even there, they realize
that things must change.


1953
02:55:25.558 --> 02:55:29.061
Many have little faith
in a changed world,..


1954
02:55:29.395 --> 02:55:30.813
But I do.

1955
02:55:33.065 --> 02:55:37.069
You, Luca, will lead a more
upright, honest life.


1956
02:55:40.155 --> 02:55:43.075
The siren.
I have to go back.


1957
02:55:48.998 --> 02:55:52.084
- Give Mamma a kiss for me.
- Uh uh.


1958
02:55:53.586 --> 02:55:55.546
- Ciao, Luca.
- Ciao.


1959
02:56:39.214 --> 02:56:40.383
Ciro!

1960
02:56:45.763 --> 02:56:46.763
Ciro!

1961
02:56:49.642 --> 02:56:51.144
- Ciao.
- How are you?


1962
02:56:51.145 --> 02:56:52.811
- Fine.
- Why did you come?


1963
02:56:52.812 --> 02:56:55.022
- Ciao.
- Ciao, how are you?


1964
02:56:56.482 --> 02:56:58.900
- Hey, it's late.
- I'll be right there!


1965
02:56:58.901 --> 02:57:01.821
I came to tell you I love you.

1966
02:57:01.987 --> 02:57:04.324
I do too... forever!

1967
02:57:09.329 --> 02:57:10.788
Ciro!

1968
02:57:13.333 --> 02:57:14.584
What is it?

1969
02:57:14.834 --> 02:57:16.669
Come home tonight!

1970
02:57:18.421 --> 02:57:20.966
We'll be waiting. Ciao.

1971
02:57:21.591 --> 02:57:22.758
I'll come.
