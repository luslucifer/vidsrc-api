THIS STORY IS INSPIRED
BY REAL EVENTS


2
00:00:25.327 --> 00:00:27.952
SOME CHARACTERS AND SITUATIONS
HAVE BEEN FICTIONALIZED


3
00:00:28.536 --> 00:00:31.202
IN MEMORY OF PEDRO COSTA

4
00:01:06.327 --> 00:01:09.786
<i>The first time I heard of Baler,
I was 20.</i>


5
00:01:11.452 --> 00:01:14.036
<i>I was told it was a Tagalog town,</i>

6
00:01:14.202 --> 00:01:15.661
<i>north of Manila,</i>

7
00:01:16.786 --> 00:01:20.577
<i>an accursed place
surrounded by sea and jungle,</i>


8
00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.494
<i>inhabited by bloodthirsty rebels
who hated Spain.</i>


9
00:01:29.161 --> 00:01:30.994
<i>One night,</i>

10
00:01:31.161 --> 00:01:33.869
<i>in October 1897,</i>

11
00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:38.994
<i>a detachment defending the town
was massacred without mercy.</i>


12
00:01:49.327 --> 00:01:50.702
<i>There was terror,...</i>

13
00:01:51.911 --> 00:01:53.577
Lieutenant!

14
00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.327
<i>...despair,</i>

15
00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:00.161
<i>chaos...</i>

16
00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:13.327
<i>It was shameful.</i>

17
00:02:16.036 --> 00:02:19.327
<i>Of fifty soldiers,
only thirteen survived.</i>


18
00:02:26.952 --> 00:02:29.161
<i>They fought for their freedom,</i>

19
00:02:31.244 --> 00:02:33.619
<i>we fought for
the survival of an empire.</i>


20
00:02:47.911 --> 00:02:49.244
<i>And we lost.</i>

21
00:03:35.411 --> 00:03:38.286
<i>Three months later,
I was sent with the next group.</i>


22
00:03:40.077 --> 00:03:42.661
<i>Our mission was to recover
this accursed town,</i>


23
00:03:43.702 --> 00:03:45.369
<i>and the grandeur of Spain.</i>

24
00:03:47.244 --> 00:03:48.952
<i>I didn't know it yet,</i>

25
00:03:49.119 --> 00:03:52.536
<i>but we were destined to be
the last defenders of the Empire,</i>


26
00:03:54.911 --> 00:03:57.202
<i>the last ones on the Philippines.</i>

27
00:03:57.369 --> 00:04:02.161
1898, OUR LAST MEN IN THE PHILIPPINES

28
00:04:28.494 --> 00:04:30.202
<i>I'd never been in a war...</i>

29
00:04:31.536 --> 00:04:33.036
<i>and I thought that, to survive,</i>

30
00:04:33.202 --> 00:04:35.786
<i>I just needed a little luck</i>

31
00:04:35.952 --> 00:04:37.411
<i>and common sense.</i>

32
00:04:41.286 --> 00:04:42.577
<i>I was young.</i>

33
00:04:45.369 --> 00:04:47.411
<i>I was naïve.</i>

34
00:05:02.952 --> 00:05:05.286
- You can't see anyone.
- It's what they do best:


35
00:05:05.452 --> 00:05:07.619
hide, kill, hide...

36
00:05:07.786 --> 00:05:10.786
That'll do, "Ron",
you'll get a belly ache.


37
00:05:11.744 --> 00:05:13.536
Keep your eyes peeled.

38
00:05:16.786 --> 00:05:20.077
Away all boats, arms ready!

39
00:05:20.244 --> 00:05:22.119
Let's go, men!

40
00:05:22.286 --> 00:05:24.869
- Away all boats!
- Come on, hurry up!


41
00:05:25.119 --> 00:05:26.952
God help us.

42
00:05:27.119 --> 00:05:30.119
- Come on, go!
- How did I get into this? Damn it!


43
00:05:34.161 --> 00:05:37.369
Lieutenant, there's a man
on the shore!


44
00:06:15.994 --> 00:06:18.077
Lieutenant Martín Cerezo,

45
00:06:18.244 --> 00:06:20.786
Brother Carmelo,
I look after the parish.


46
00:06:20.952 --> 00:06:22.369
Do you command these men?

47
00:06:22.827 --> 00:06:24.702
That's Captain Las Morenas.
He's coming.


48
00:06:24.869 --> 00:06:27.452
- Have you come from Manila?
- Yes, Father.


49
00:06:27.619 --> 00:06:29.119
To recover the town.

50
00:06:29.286 --> 00:06:32.119
- Where's the best access?
- An hour upriver.


51
00:06:32.286 --> 00:06:33.828
The rebels left two weeks ago...

52
00:06:33.994 --> 00:06:35.036
Fix bayonets!

53
00:06:36.119 --> 00:06:38.619
The remaining natives are peaceful.

54
00:06:38.786 --> 00:06:40.452
Let me be the judge of that.

55
00:06:41.994 --> 00:06:44.827
We advance in two columns.
Carvajal, on point.


56
00:06:45.702 --> 00:06:47.619
Everyone on the alert. Move!

57
00:06:47.786 --> 00:06:49.702
Unfurl the flag and come with me.

58
00:09:14.744 --> 00:09:17.827
Luis, take five men
and check the church.


59
00:09:17.994 --> 00:09:19.077
On me!

60
00:09:19.577 --> 00:09:21.535
How thick are these walls?

61
00:09:21.702 --> 00:09:23.869
Almost five feet.

62
00:09:24.036 --> 00:09:26.869
Five feet can take the impact
of heavy artillery.


63
00:09:27.036 --> 00:09:30.369
Apart from the sacristy,
what else can we use for storage?


64
00:09:37.786 --> 00:09:39.369
Sergeant Jimeno Costa.

65
00:09:41.744 --> 00:09:44.202
I'm a survivor
of the previous detachment.


66
00:09:45.536 --> 00:09:48.536
At your orders, Lieutenant.

67
00:09:50.119 --> 00:09:52.119
I've been waiting for you for weeks.

68
00:09:52.286 --> 00:09:55.411
Regulations say you should've gone
with your men to Manila.


69
00:09:59.827 --> 00:10:02.286
The first duty of a soldier,
Lieutenant,


70
00:10:03.327 --> 00:10:06.369
- is to defend Spain.
- You didn't do that too well.


71
00:10:06.536 --> 00:10:10.244
I didn't surrender, God knows
I fought until I had no strength left.


72
00:10:11.536 --> 00:10:15.202
Isn't this enough for you,
or this?


73
00:10:22.452 --> 00:10:24.369
If the Tagalog come down again,

74
00:10:25.494 --> 00:10:27.452
you're going to need me.

75
00:10:27.952 --> 00:10:29.411
I know what's going on here.

76
00:10:29.577 --> 00:10:31.244
Why didn't you take down that flag?

77
00:10:31.411 --> 00:10:33.786
They cut ours to pieces.

78
00:10:34.827 --> 00:10:36.994
And the townspeople want this one.

79
00:10:37.744 --> 00:10:38.786
Jose.

80
00:10:43.202 --> 00:10:45.327
Hoist it.

81
00:11:04.661 --> 00:11:06.869
Keeping it as a souvenir?

82
00:11:07.036 --> 00:11:10.494
Be careful of the women
in the town, Lieutenant.


83
00:11:10.661 --> 00:11:12.744
They all spy for the enemy.

84
00:11:14.244 --> 00:11:16.369
- What's your name?
- Teresa.


85
00:11:16.536 --> 00:11:19.786
She's a whore,
her brother fights with the rebels.


86
00:11:19.952 --> 00:11:22.577
What my brother does
is his business.


87
00:11:23.619 --> 00:11:25.827
I've got nothing against Spain.

88
00:11:27.202 --> 00:11:28.827
I'm baptized

89
00:11:28.994 --> 00:11:31.661
and I sing in the church choir.

90
00:11:32.286 --> 00:11:34.828
What do you sing?
Christmas carols?


91
00:11:38.327 --> 00:11:39.869
Love songs.

92
00:11:40.911 --> 00:11:42.286
Whatever you like.

93
00:11:44.202 --> 00:11:45.702
What songs do you know?

94
00:11:46.994 --> 00:11:49.869
Spanish, Filipino...

95
00:11:50.661 --> 00:11:51.744
Sing one.

96
00:11:51.911 --> 00:11:55.911
- I sing when I get paid.
- Like all whores.


97
00:12:14.036 --> 00:12:22.494
<i>I will tell you...</i>

98
00:12:26.327 --> 00:12:27.161
Go on.

99
00:12:27.994 --> 00:12:29.827
That's all you paid for.

100
00:12:31.327 --> 00:12:32.577
Welcome to Baler...

101
00:12:34.369 --> 00:12:35.577
...sir.

102
00:12:48.827 --> 00:12:51.535
The rebels belong
to a Masonic organization,


103
00:12:51.702 --> 00:12:55.827
the Katipunan, that seeks
an independent Philippines.


104
00:12:55.994 --> 00:12:58.786
They don't care that Spain
has been here for 400 years,


105
00:12:58.952 --> 00:13:02.327
that we've built its cities.
They want us out, and dead.


106
00:13:03.202 --> 00:13:05.411
The Tagalog are tough,

107
00:13:05.702 --> 00:13:08.452
they're very violent,
and they have great allies:


108
00:13:09.827 --> 00:13:12.244
the heat, malaria,

109
00:13:13.244 --> 00:13:16.161
typhoons and beasts.

110
00:13:19.327 --> 00:13:22.911
You're very young, very green,

111
00:13:24.077 --> 00:13:25.161
and inept

112
00:13:27.119 --> 00:13:29.661
If you want to survive,

113
00:13:30.702 --> 00:13:32.494
you'll have to learn fast.

114
00:13:34.452 --> 00:13:37.827
Whoever doesn't,
God have mercy on him.


115
00:14:00.036 --> 00:14:01.077
We'll survive.

116
00:14:02.661 --> 00:14:04.744
This little Virgin is lucky.

117
00:14:04.911 --> 00:14:08.452
Lucky for everyone, or just you?

118
00:14:08.619 --> 00:14:10.827
If you want to trust in the Virgin,
it's up to you,


119
00:14:10.994 --> 00:14:13.577
but the men butchered here
had crucifixes too.


120
00:14:14.286 --> 00:14:15.911
They died for Spain.

121
00:14:16.077 --> 00:14:19.619
For Spain...
What's Spain done for you?


122
00:14:21.369 --> 00:14:22.827
I'm not here by choice.

123
00:14:22.994 --> 00:14:26.702
When why the hell
are you here, Juan?


124
00:14:59.536 --> 00:15:01.161
Aim!

125
00:15:02.369 --> 00:15:03.036
Fire!

126
00:15:03.994 --> 00:15:05.536
Ready!

127
00:15:05.869 --> 00:15:06.869
Fire!

128
00:15:08.327 --> 00:15:11.452
- Cease fire. Weapons down.
- Are they really this bad?


129
00:15:11.619 --> 00:15:13.452
It's the first time
they've fired a gun.


130
00:15:14.494 --> 00:15:16.161
My God.

131
00:15:16.327 --> 00:15:18.327
You've said it my captain,
they'll have to learn.


132
00:15:18.494 --> 00:15:20.452
I don't know if they'll have time.

133
00:15:20.619 --> 00:15:22.536
Then we'll need to dig
a lot of graves.


134
00:15:22.702 --> 00:15:25.286
I'm not making my wife a widow.

135
00:15:25.452 --> 00:15:26.286
Aim!

136
00:15:26.452 --> 00:15:28.119
I know yours died recently.

137
00:15:28.286 --> 00:15:29.327
Fire!

138
00:15:29.494 --> 00:15:33.077
I lost my daughter too.
Three days old. Tuberculosis.


139
00:15:33.244 --> 00:15:35.661
- My condolences.
- Fire!


140
00:15:35.827 --> 00:15:37.661
Why didn't you stay in Spain?

141
00:15:39.494 --> 00:15:41.994
It's the last place I wanted to be.

142
00:15:42.161 --> 00:15:43.744
Fire!

143
00:15:44.702 --> 00:15:46.577
You didn't come to sacrifice yourself?

144
00:15:48.786 --> 00:15:51.744
Look, Lieutenant, in war
there are two types of soldier:


145
00:15:51.911 --> 00:15:54.328
those who want medals
and those who want to get home.


146
00:15:54.744 --> 00:15:57.036
Given the choice,
I'd prefer the former.


147
00:15:59.036 --> 00:16:01.244
They're the most dangerous.

148
00:16:02.411 --> 00:16:04.327
Put your heart into it!

149
00:16:06.077 --> 00:16:09.244
A circle around me! Let's go!

150
00:16:09.411 --> 00:16:11.828
- In a circle!
- Keep your distance!


151
00:16:22.952 --> 00:16:25.161
They didn't even get your
boot size right, eh?


152
00:16:27.536 --> 00:16:30.327
They send you here
without knowing how to shoot,


153
00:16:30.494 --> 00:16:33.827
- with boots the wrong size...
- I'll adapt, Lieutenant.


154
00:16:33.994 --> 00:16:35.452
Is your morale that high?

155
00:16:36.494 --> 00:16:39.452
If I get back from the war
with an exemplary conduct letter,


156
00:16:39.661 --> 00:16:41.744
I can study at
the Royal Academy.


157
00:16:41.911 --> 00:16:44.036
- Study what?
- Painting, Lieutenant.


158
00:16:44.202 --> 00:16:47.536
I want to be a painter.
Don Gabriel says I'm good.


159
00:16:47.702 --> 00:16:50.077
- Who's Don Gabriel?
- The mayor of my hometown.


160
00:16:50.244 --> 00:16:53.786
He promised to pay for my studies
if I make it back with that letter.


161
00:16:53.952 --> 00:16:56.452
He should've paid
the 2,000 pesetas


162
00:16:56.619 --> 00:16:59.369
- to get you out of the Army.
- Don Gabriel is a patriot.


163
00:16:59.536 --> 00:17:02.577
- He says that Spain needs...
- Spain is full of patriots like him.


164
00:17:02.744 --> 00:17:05.702
They send off other men
while they stuff themselves.


165
00:17:08.577 --> 00:17:10.286
The aim is restore

166
00:17:10.452 --> 00:17:13.619
the original tone and brightness

167
00:17:13.786 --> 00:17:16.119
and emphasize their contour.

168
00:17:18.702 --> 00:17:19.744
Look.

169
00:17:22.202 --> 00:17:23.244
You see?

170
00:17:25.036 --> 00:17:28.911
- And you want me to do it?
- Well, I saw your drawings.


171
00:17:29.077 --> 00:17:31.577
And the lieutenant tells me
you want to devote yourself to this.


172
00:17:31.744 --> 00:17:32.869
It's an opportunity.

173
00:17:33.036 --> 00:17:36.494
I don't know, Father, I haven't
had much practice with brushes.


174
00:17:36.661 --> 00:17:38.786
- I don't want to desecrate...
- Desecrate?


175
00:17:39.452 --> 00:17:42.452
I've been a missionary
around the world for 20 years.


176
00:17:42.619 --> 00:17:45.369
If I only did
what the seminary taught, I'd be dead.


177
00:17:47.619 --> 00:17:48.744
Son,

178
00:17:49.786 --> 00:17:53.952
the natives like to be told stories.

179
00:17:54.119 --> 00:17:55.286
I'm just asking you

180
00:17:55.452 --> 00:17:58.577
to make them more attractive.

181
00:17:58.744 --> 00:18:01.952
And I needn't tell you
that while you're on this job


182
00:18:02.119 --> 00:18:04.661
you'll be off guard duty
or anything else.


183
00:18:05.619 --> 00:18:09.077
<i>Where God is in charge,
no captain is.</i>


184
00:18:10.327 --> 00:18:12.286
Rifles up close!

185
00:18:12.536 --> 00:18:15.202
Present... arms!

186
00:18:16.452 --> 00:18:19.077
Order... arms!

187
00:18:20.119 --> 00:18:21.994
Head up! With pride!

188
00:18:26.952 --> 00:18:28.911
Who taught you to paint like that?

189
00:18:29.077 --> 00:18:32.036
I learnt with limestone and clay.
While Grandpa herded,


190
00:18:32.202 --> 00:18:35.202
I'd amuse myself by drawing.

191
00:18:35.369 --> 00:18:36.661
Where are you from?

192
00:18:37.952 --> 00:18:41.119
Fuenlabrada de Los Montes,
in Extremadura.


193
00:18:43.036 --> 00:18:46.286
Son, I think you were born
in the wrong place.


194
00:19:18.369 --> 00:19:19.911
Crocodiles.

195
00:19:20.077 --> 00:19:20.744
Sergeant.

196
00:19:23.994 --> 00:19:26.494
Sometimes they get dogs, cats,

197
00:19:27.036 --> 00:19:29.119
whatever they can find.

198
00:19:30.202 --> 00:19:32.869
I wish they'd eat the captain's dog.

199
00:19:34.952 --> 00:19:37.827
How the hell can you
come to war with a dog?


200
00:19:43.661 --> 00:19:45.494
Don't you ever rest?

201
00:19:46.119 --> 00:19:49.952
No. They've captured me once before.

202
00:19:50.119 --> 00:19:52.202
It's not going to happen again.

203
00:19:54.119 --> 00:19:55.744
Is this your first war?

204
00:19:58.036 --> 00:20:00.619
Watch out it doesn't become a vice.

205
00:20:01.577 --> 00:20:03.452
What?

206
00:20:04.369 --> 00:20:05.411
Killing.

207
00:20:11.786 --> 00:20:12.911
Hold still!

208
00:20:14.619 --> 00:20:15.577
Hold still!

209
00:20:16.744 --> 00:20:19.744
We caught her heading for
the hills with food.


210
00:20:22.702 --> 00:20:23.577
Let her go.

211
00:20:26.119 --> 00:20:27.119
Sergeant...

212
00:20:27.286 --> 00:20:29.036
What do you think?

213
00:20:29.202 --> 00:20:31.327
What the hell do you think?

214
00:20:32.036 --> 00:20:34.369
She only hauls food?

215
00:20:34.536 --> 00:20:35.953
This bitch knows where you sleep,

216
00:20:36.119 --> 00:20:39.327
what you eat, what you shit!

217
00:20:39.494 --> 00:20:42.994
She want to fuck us up
and nobody's doing that to me!


218
00:21:03.994 --> 00:21:05.494
It's for your brother.

219
00:21:06.452 --> 00:21:09.994
It's just food, I have nothing
to do with this war.


220
00:21:10.161 --> 00:21:11.786
You do now.

221
00:21:13.411 --> 00:21:14.244
Go on, go.

222
00:21:14.577 --> 00:21:15.702
- Sergeant...
- Lieutenant!


223
00:21:15.869 --> 00:21:16.994
Let her go.

224
00:21:21.869 --> 00:21:23.619
If you want to
join your people, do it.


225
00:21:25.619 --> 00:21:27.994
But give your brother a message:

226
00:21:28.161 --> 00:21:31.452
lf they come back to Baler,
we'll be waiting,


227
00:21:32.286 --> 00:21:34.411
and this time
there'll be no surrender.


228
00:21:48.577 --> 00:21:50.661
It's a mistake to let her go.

229
00:21:50.994 --> 00:21:52.619
It's a sign of weakness.

230
00:21:52.869 --> 00:21:55.244
Do you know what is
a sign of weakness?


231
00:21:57.161 --> 00:21:58.744
Killing women.

232
00:22:07.077 --> 00:22:08.161
Halt!

233
00:22:10.952 --> 00:22:12.036
- Don't shoot!
- Halt!


234
00:22:12.202 --> 00:22:14.786
- It's Spanish mail!
- Keep a lookout!


235
00:22:15.577 --> 00:22:16.869
Help me, help me.

236
00:22:17.911 --> 00:22:19.327
He's in bad shape.

237
00:22:23.619 --> 00:22:25.452
The Americans declared war on us.

238
00:22:25.619 --> 00:22:26.661
What?

239
00:22:27.702 --> 00:22:29.827
They're accusing us of sinking
some ship in Havana.


240
00:22:29.994 --> 00:22:32.827
Their fleet has destroyed
the Spanish fleet in Cavite.


241
00:22:32.994 --> 00:22:34.411
What about Manila?

242
00:22:34.577 --> 00:22:35.702
Under siege.

243
00:22:40.077 --> 00:22:42.202
Did you cross the Sierra Madre?

244
00:22:42.911 --> 00:22:44.369
The Tagalog...

245
00:22:44.536 --> 00:22:46.869
The Tagalog attacked you?
How many were there?


246
00:22:48.327 --> 00:22:49.952
- 50.
- How many did you see?


247
00:22:51.077 --> 00:22:53.077
Out! Everyone out, please!

248
00:22:54.452 --> 00:22:56.036
Hold him. Lift him up.

249
00:23:17.952 --> 00:23:20.411
Gentlemen, Manila HQ

250
00:23:20.577 --> 00:23:22.536
will not be able to send us supplies.

251
00:23:23.619 --> 00:23:26.286
That cuts us off
from the rest of the country.


252
00:23:26.452 --> 00:23:29.786
From now on
we rely on ourselves.


253
00:23:29.952 --> 00:23:32.660
The rebels are up there waiting for
the right time to come down.


254
00:23:33.244 --> 00:23:34.911
There are fifty of us

255
00:23:35.077 --> 00:23:37.827
and they could number
a hundred, two hundred,


256
00:23:37.994 --> 00:23:39.119
even a thousand.

257
00:23:39.286 --> 00:23:41.786
To avoid any surprises,
I've made a decision.


258
00:23:42.827 --> 00:23:45.369
We'll turn the church into a fortress

259
00:23:45.536 --> 00:23:48.411
<i>and take refuge inside.</i>

260
00:23:48.827 --> 00:23:51.827
<i>We'll confiscate animals for reserves
in the event of a siege.</i>


261
00:23:51.994 --> 00:23:54.411
Bermúdez, occupy the corral.
Eduardo, take three men


262
00:23:54.577 --> 00:23:56.869
and search that cabin.
The rest of you, on me.


263
00:23:57.036 --> 00:24:00.369
Someone told them
to leave here, Sergeant.


264
00:24:00.536 --> 00:24:03.202
<i>We'll use the church courtyard
as a garden</i>


265
00:24:03.536 --> 00:24:06.202
<i>and we'll dig a well
for fresh water.</i>


266
00:24:09.452 --> 00:24:12.077
<i>The sacristy
will be our infirmary...</i>


267
00:24:14.286 --> 00:24:16.161
<i>and the basement our storeroom.</i>

268
00:24:21.452 --> 00:24:22.827
The last one?

269
00:24:24.702 --> 00:24:28.411
<i>We'll raise the Spanish flag
high on the bell tower.</i>


270
00:24:32.744 --> 00:24:36.744
<i>Gentlemen, we can't tell you
what's happening in Manila,</i>


271
00:24:36.911 --> 00:24:39.411
<i>San Juan or Havana,</i>

272
00:24:39.577 --> 00:24:42.119
<i>but I can tell you
what we're going to do here.</i>


273
00:24:43.702 --> 00:24:45.911
<i>- We're going to fight.
- Hurrah for Spain!</i>


274
00:24:46.077 --> 00:24:47.452
<i>Hurrah!</i>

275
00:25:01.619 --> 00:25:05.244
JUNE 30, 1898

276
00:25:41.452 --> 00:25:42.452
Who goes there?!

277
00:25:45.494 --> 00:25:46.744
Who goes there?!

278
00:25:56.452 --> 00:26:00.161
The Tagalog are attacking!
They're attacking!


279
00:26:00.327 --> 00:26:01.411
Fire!

280
00:26:03.202 --> 00:26:04.369
Come out!

281
00:26:04.536 --> 00:26:06.369
Go, quickly!

282
00:26:06.536 --> 00:26:09.369
To the trench!
Keep them back from the church!


283
00:26:09.536 --> 00:26:11.036
Vigil, take the courtyard.

284
00:26:11.202 --> 00:26:14.452
Carvajal, take your two best shots
up to the choir level.


285
00:26:14.619 --> 00:26:17.077
- Positions at the windows. Go!
- Yes, sir.


286
00:26:17.244 --> 00:26:19.119
Everyone to the trenches!

287
00:26:19.661 --> 00:26:21.161
Quickly!

288
00:26:24.077 --> 00:26:26.702
Go, fire! Fire!

289
00:26:27.494 --> 00:26:31.077
Fire at will!
Everyone in position!


290
00:26:31.244 --> 00:26:31.911
Go!

291
00:26:33.494 --> 00:26:36.452
To the trench! Take cover!

292
00:26:37.702 --> 00:26:39.911
Go, go, go!

293
00:26:48.911 --> 00:26:49.702
Fire!

294
00:26:55.452 --> 00:26:56.411
Fire!

295
00:26:58.244 --> 00:26:59.994
Don't let them get close!

296
00:27:06.411 --> 00:27:07.619
Andrés.

297
00:27:14.411 --> 00:27:16.577
Good God... Fire at will!

298
00:27:23.869 --> 00:27:25.327
Fix bayonets!!

299
00:27:29.661 --> 00:27:31.286
Keep firing!

300
00:27:41.702 --> 00:27:43.952
Get up! Fuck!

301
00:28:00.911 --> 00:28:03.577
Lieutenant!
Fall back from the trench!


302
00:28:03.994 --> 00:28:06.119
- Captain...
- Sound retreat!


303
00:28:08.161 --> 00:28:10.119
Jimeno! Fall back!

304
00:28:11.327 --> 00:28:14.619
Back! Fall back!

305
00:28:15.536 --> 00:28:17.036
Cease fire! Retreat!

306
00:28:18.994 --> 00:28:20.036
Retreat?

307
00:28:21.244 --> 00:28:23.161
You don't win wars that way.

308
00:28:23.327 --> 00:28:24.869
Go!

309
00:28:33.327 --> 00:28:35.786
They're here!

310
00:28:38.411 --> 00:28:40.578
Up! Let's go!

311
00:28:42.119 --> 00:28:45.202
Let's go!

312
00:29:49.827 --> 00:29:52.327
They outnumbered us, Carlos.
There were thousands of them.


313
00:29:52.494 --> 00:29:53.744
That's not true.

314
00:29:55.077 --> 00:29:56.619
It isn't?

315
00:29:56.786 --> 00:29:58.619
There weren't thousands,
don't exaggerate.


316
00:29:59.702 --> 00:30:01.661
Where the hell were you?

317
00:30:01.827 --> 00:30:03.369
Fighting, just like you.

318
00:30:03.869 --> 00:30:05.619
Are you calling me a liar?

319
00:30:06.744 --> 00:30:08.327
Are you calling me a liar?

320
00:30:08.494 --> 00:30:09.702
Soldiers!

321
00:30:09.869 --> 00:30:10.952
What are you doing?

322
00:30:12.702 --> 00:30:13.702
Right...

323
00:30:13.869 --> 00:30:15.369
Can you follow this finger?

324
00:30:17.244 --> 00:30:19.869
You were up top.
Tell him how many there were.


325
00:30:21.369 --> 00:30:25.036
Thousands, coming from
everywhere, like cockroaches.


326
00:30:26.952 --> 00:30:29.536
That's not the worst thing.
The worst thing is that we're alone.


327
00:30:29.702 --> 00:30:31.744
Manila's not sending anyone.

328
00:30:31.911 --> 00:30:35.077
We've got the food and ammo
to hold on.


329
00:30:35.244 --> 00:30:38.619
We're fifty scared shitless men
in a church.


330
00:30:38.786 --> 00:30:39.994
Scared shitless?

331
00:30:42.244 --> 00:30:45.202
One battle and you're already
bawling like little girls?


332
00:30:45.369 --> 00:30:46.036
Captain!

333
00:30:47.827 --> 00:30:49.077
Captain!

334
00:30:49.952 --> 00:30:51.577
Go ahead.

335
00:30:51.744 --> 00:30:53.327
They're sending an emissary.

336
00:31:00.077 --> 00:31:02.536
Lieutenant, see what they want.

337
00:31:06.952 --> 00:31:09.077
Moisés, your Mauser.

338
00:31:09.244 --> 00:31:11.077
Carvajal, upstairs.
You come with me.


339
00:31:56.077 --> 00:31:59.661
Calixto Villacorta,
for Commander Luna Novicio,


340
00:31:59.827 --> 00:32:02.744
head of the Filipino forces
in the Katipunan region.


341
00:32:03.869 --> 00:32:06.369
Lieutenant Martín Cerezo,

342
00:32:06.536 --> 00:32:08.411
My commander
wants no more bloodshed.


343
00:32:10.286 --> 00:32:12.452
Spanish troops are losing everywhere.

344
00:32:12.619 --> 00:32:16.619
Tell him to hand in his arms
and accept Spanish jurisdiction.


345
00:32:17.577 --> 00:32:19.536
You're losing the war.

346
00:32:19.702 --> 00:32:22.786
I see more of your dead
than I do mine.


347
00:32:30.119 --> 00:32:32.161
I should speak to your superior.

348
00:32:35.577 --> 00:32:37.327
There's nothing to say.

349
00:32:41.619 --> 00:32:43.661
We'll grant you
a truce until tomorrow.


350
00:32:45.161 --> 00:32:47.452
Each side can bury their own.

351
00:33:04.661 --> 00:33:06.369
See to the dead.

352
00:33:15.952 --> 00:33:17.369
Well?

353
00:33:17.536 --> 00:33:19.411
They want us to lay down our arms.

354
00:33:20.827 --> 00:33:22.452
There was no offer?

355
00:33:24.494 --> 00:33:27.536
We're in no condition
to receive offers, Captain.


356
00:33:53.161 --> 00:33:55.619
Don't look too hard,
we'll all end up like this.


357
00:33:56.494 --> 00:33:57.744
Shut up.

358
00:34:02.494 --> 00:34:03.827
Juan, help me.

359
00:34:32.077 --> 00:34:34.119
Leave him, I'll do it.

360
00:34:35.536 --> 00:34:36.619
Hold tight.

361
00:34:46.327 --> 00:34:48.661
He's gone putrid!
We have to pull him out.


362
00:34:49.702 --> 00:34:51.869
Shouldn't we just
cover him with earth?


363
00:34:52.036 --> 00:34:54.036
- Would you want to be left here?
- Let's go!


364
00:35:12.702 --> 00:35:13.786
Juan!

365
00:35:15.452 --> 00:35:17.619
Give me a hand.

366
00:35:20.786 --> 00:35:21.911
Juan...

367
00:35:37.661 --> 00:35:39.661
What the hell's he doing?

368
00:35:40.577 --> 00:35:42.911
He's deserting.

369
00:35:46.286 --> 00:35:47.827
Juan!

370
00:35:47.994 --> 00:35:49.869
Juan!

371
00:35:53.702 --> 00:35:55.869
What are you waiting for? Shoot!

372
00:35:59.327 --> 00:36:02.036
Shoot! That's an order!

373
00:36:03.994 --> 00:36:05.327
Shoot!

374
00:36:21.161 --> 00:36:23.577
<i>We bid farewell
to these war heroes,</i>


375
00:36:23.744 --> 00:36:26.119
<i>with eternal thanks
for their endeavor.</i>


376
00:36:26.286 --> 00:36:29.244
May God reward them

377
00:36:29.411 --> 00:36:31.452
when He receives them in Heaven.

378
00:36:31.619 --> 00:36:33.661
May his Holiness hold him in glory

379
00:36:33.827 --> 00:36:36.077
and may he be forever in our hearts.
Amen.


380
00:36:36.244 --> 00:36:37.452
Amen.

381
00:37:02.244 --> 00:37:05.994
Bad times are coming,
and we have to be ready.


382
00:37:12.077 --> 00:37:13.411
This...

383
00:37:13.577 --> 00:37:16.827
will help us keep hunger
and despair at bay.


384
00:37:19.744 --> 00:37:20.911
What is it?

385
00:37:22.286 --> 00:37:23.619
Opium.

386
00:37:23.786 --> 00:37:26.244
There's not enough for everyone,
but we can share it.


387
00:37:26.911 --> 00:37:29.577
Have you ever tried it?

388
00:37:31.536 --> 00:37:33.036
Before the Philippines

389
00:37:33.202 --> 00:37:36.827
I was spreading the gospel
in the south of China.


390
00:37:36.994 --> 00:37:39.244
There they give their lives
for this stuff,


391
00:37:39.411 --> 00:37:42.119
men get addicted, lose their teeth,

392
00:37:42.286 --> 00:37:44.411
women their dignity...

393
00:37:45.452 --> 00:37:47.577
but it also relieves pain.

394
00:37:48.786 --> 00:37:49.619
What pain?

395
00:37:53.702 --> 00:37:54.827
All pain.

396
00:37:57.327 --> 00:37:59.369
If God wants me to keep working,

397
00:37:59.786 --> 00:38:02.161
and I believe he does,

398
00:38:02.327 --> 00:38:04.036
I need to be strong.

399
00:38:06.494 --> 00:38:07.702
You do too.

400
00:38:09.202 --> 00:38:10.327
Me?

401
00:38:12.202 --> 00:38:13.411
Go on, smoke.

402
00:38:15.036 --> 00:38:16.119
Smoke.

403
00:38:40.869 --> 00:38:43.327
Most Spaniards can't read,

404
00:38:44.369 --> 00:38:46.786
but they know that
Cortez conquered Mexico,


405
00:38:46.952 --> 00:38:50.369
and they know it from
paintings, prints, drawings...


406
00:38:52.036 --> 00:38:53.869
What's this got to do with Mexico?

407
00:38:54.036 --> 00:38:57.494
Son, an empire was born there,

408
00:38:57.661 --> 00:38:59.994
and here we may be burying it.

409
00:39:00.369 --> 00:39:01.786
Don't say that, Father.

410
00:39:01.952 --> 00:39:03.411
What I say doesn't matter.

411
00:39:04.244 --> 00:39:06.286
It's for the Lord to decide.

412
00:39:06.452 --> 00:39:07.661
If that happens,

413
00:39:08.869 --> 00:39:10.161
it'll be a disaster.

414
00:39:10.327 --> 00:39:13.619
Yes, but someone
will have to paint it.


415
00:39:48.911 --> 00:39:50.161
What are you doing there?

416
00:39:51.286 --> 00:39:54.827
Stop listening! The bastards
are playing tricks on us!


417
00:39:54.994 --> 00:39:57.702
Anyone not on guard,
back inside the church.


418
00:39:57.869 --> 00:39:59.036
Go!

419
00:40:09.077 --> 00:40:12.119
<i>...because...</i>

420
00:40:12.286 --> 00:40:15.619
<i>my song...</i>

421
00:40:21.119 --> 00:40:23.661
Sons of bitches!

422
00:40:32.327 --> 00:40:34.286
Long live Spain, damn it!

423
00:40:34.452 --> 00:40:36.411
Long live the Philippines!

424
00:40:38.244 --> 00:40:41.327
<i>I need your laughter,</i>

425
00:40:41.494 --> 00:40:43.577
<i>I need your kisses,</i>

426
00:40:44.827 --> 00:40:49.744
<i>I need your spark.</i>

427
00:40:50.702 --> 00:40:53.244
<i>I need your laughter,</i>

428
00:40:54.661 --> 00:40:57.494
<i>I need your kisses,</i>

429
00:40:59.244 --> 00:41:00.952
<i>I need...</i>

430
00:41:02.494 --> 00:41:06.494
<i>your spark.</i>

431
00:41:19.036 --> 00:41:21.869
OCTOBER 10, 1898

432
00:41:22.036 --> 00:41:25.244
THREE MONTHS OF SIEGE

433
00:42:16.411 --> 00:42:17.702
Here, "Ron".

434
00:42:21.827 --> 00:42:23.202
Where are you, "Ron"?

435
00:42:26.369 --> 00:42:27.411
"Ron".

436
00:42:28.661 --> 00:42:30.702
"Ron".

437
00:42:32.411 --> 00:42:34.411
We should sacrifice
the captain's dog.


438
00:42:39.369 --> 00:42:40.452
Don't you think, Lieutenant?

439
00:42:40.619 --> 00:42:43.911
- Not much protein.
- Right, but it's something.


440
00:42:45.244 --> 00:42:49.244
The sacks we had to throw away
were his responsibility.


441
00:42:50.952 --> 00:42:53.869
I bet in Manila he took more care
about his dog biscuits


442
00:42:54.036 --> 00:42:57.202
- than our food.
- Watch your mouth, Sergeant.


443
00:42:57.369 --> 00:43:00.619
Lieutenant, the captain...

444
00:43:00.786 --> 00:43:03.619
isn't like us. You know it.

445
00:43:03.786 --> 00:43:05.202
What do I know?

446
00:43:30.661 --> 00:43:31.786
Lieutenant...

447
00:43:33.286 --> 00:43:36.619
I've got no room,
put him there till there's a bed.


448
00:43:38.369 --> 00:43:41.619
Give him water with sugar
to hydrate him. Here.


449
00:43:46.286 --> 00:43:49.619
No, small sips,
so his stomach doesn't reject it.


450
00:44:03.244 --> 00:44:04.369
Lieutenant...

451
00:44:06.244 --> 00:44:07.577
What's happening?

452
00:44:09.411 --> 00:44:10.911
It's the food,

453
00:44:11.077 --> 00:44:13.619
the sacks from Manila
were contaminated.


454
00:44:15.827 --> 00:44:17.952
We're going to be like this
the whole time?


455
00:44:18.702 --> 00:44:19.994
No. We'll get worse.

456
00:44:22.786 --> 00:44:24.077
Look...

457
00:44:30.036 --> 00:44:31.411
What's he got?

458
00:44:31.577 --> 00:44:32.869
It's called beriberi.

459
00:44:33.286 --> 00:44:35.869
The body becomes malnourished,
it lacks minerals...


460
00:44:36.911 --> 00:44:39.911
It starts in the legs,
but slowly affects the heart,


461
00:44:40.077 --> 00:44:42.036
the head...

462
00:44:43.286 --> 00:44:44.702
Beriberi?

463
00:44:44.869 --> 00:44:47.661
It means "I can't" in Sinhalese.

464
00:44:47.827 --> 00:44:50.744
I can't walk, I can't speak,
sleep, eat...


465
00:44:52.661 --> 00:44:57.077
It gradually paralyzes the body,
and finally the mind.


466
00:45:00.994 --> 00:45:03.036
And how is it cured?

467
00:45:03.202 --> 00:45:05.619
With fruit, meat, offal,

468
00:45:07.161 --> 00:45:08.744
just what we don't have.

469
00:45:19.536 --> 00:45:21.286
They tricked you, God damn it!

470
00:45:22.327 --> 00:45:24.869
Your superiors are lying to you!

471
00:45:25.036 --> 00:45:26.744
Spain's not at war anymore.

472
00:45:27.619 --> 00:45:31.036
We lost sovereignty
three months ago.


473
00:45:31.202 --> 00:45:32.619
Three months now!

474
00:45:34.202 --> 00:45:36.411
- Private.
- We sold the Philippines to the Americans!


475
00:45:36.577 --> 00:45:38.869
- Private!
- Now they fight against them...


476
00:45:39.036 --> 00:45:39.702
Captain.

477
00:45:40.036 --> 00:45:41.119
Come down.

478
00:45:57.536 --> 00:46:00.202
That fool's been saying that
for days, hasn't he?


479
00:46:08.952 --> 00:46:10.369
Are you alright, Captain?

480
00:46:19.202 --> 00:46:21.286
Lieutenant Martin told me

481
00:46:22.327 --> 00:46:24.411
you want to study Fine Arts,

482
00:46:26.327 --> 00:46:29.369
and you need a letter
of recommendation.


483
00:46:29.536 --> 00:46:30.827
I have a mission.

484
00:46:32.286 --> 00:46:34.119
A mission?

485
00:46:34.286 --> 00:46:36.911
The one with the courage
to carry it out


486
00:46:37.077 --> 00:46:39.077
will leave here with medals,
I assure you.


487
00:46:43.619 --> 00:46:44.619
Manila.

488
00:46:47.286 --> 00:46:48.577
Manila?

489
00:46:48.744 --> 00:46:50.577
We need to get to Manila.

490
00:46:51.661 --> 00:46:55.327
It's the only way to find out
what's actually going on.


491
00:46:56.369 --> 00:46:58.244
You have strong legs
and you're smart.


492
00:46:59.327 --> 00:47:02.036
You could cross the Sierra Madre,
reach Manila,


493
00:47:02.202 --> 00:47:04.077
and be back in a fortnight.

494
00:47:10.411 --> 00:47:12.369
I'm asking you, please.

495
00:47:18.911 --> 00:47:20.369
I'm sleepy.

496
00:47:20.744 --> 00:47:21.827
Are you scared?

497
00:47:21.994 --> 00:47:24.869
It's 200 kilometres.

498
00:47:26.619 --> 00:47:28.661
You have to get through the jungle.

499
00:47:29.702 --> 00:47:31.827
Don't think about that.

500
00:47:31.994 --> 00:47:34.577
Only God knows
what's going to happen.


501
00:47:36.619 --> 00:47:39.119
But I have to figure out
how to do it.


502
00:47:40.161 --> 00:47:41.286
You're wrong.

503
00:47:42.327 --> 00:47:44.994
Thinking weakens you,

504
00:47:45.161 --> 00:47:47.036
and your body.

505
00:47:47.202 --> 00:47:50.786
Thinking... weakens me?

506
00:47:52.077 --> 00:47:53.744
Most of us

507
00:47:53.911 --> 00:47:56.411
suffer over and fear things

508
00:47:57.452 --> 00:47:59.827
that might not ever happen,

509
00:48:01.286 --> 00:48:04.577
things that are only in our heads.

510
00:48:06.452 --> 00:48:09.369
<i>Your fear is all in your head.</i>

511
00:48:43.202 --> 00:48:44.369
Something wrong?

512
00:49:15.952 --> 00:49:18.077
Captain, what's going on?

513
00:49:28.369 --> 00:49:31.036
My dog, my dog.

514
00:49:34.994 --> 00:49:36.786
Captain...

515
00:49:50.536 --> 00:49:52.702
Who are you?

516
00:49:57.119 --> 00:49:58.161
Vigil!

517
00:49:59.827 --> 00:50:00.994
Vigil!

518
00:50:01.161 --> 00:50:03.827
Call Vigil, quickly! Quickly!

519
00:50:03.994 --> 00:50:06.577
Lieutenant, Lieutenant!

520
00:50:16.036 --> 00:50:18.202
Help me.

521
00:50:21.244 --> 00:50:22.994
Captain, can you hear me?

522
00:50:24.577 --> 00:50:25.702
Enrique.

523
00:50:26.452 --> 00:50:28.411
Enrique!

524
00:50:38.119 --> 00:50:39.744
- Ave Maria...
- What is it?


525
00:50:40.786 --> 00:50:43.161
He vomited black and collapsed.

526
00:50:52.036 --> 00:50:54.286
You'll have to take over, Lieutenant.

527
00:51:02.869 --> 00:51:05.327
Lord, we commend the soul
of your servant


528
00:51:05.494 --> 00:51:08.202
so that, dead to the world,
he is alive to you,


529
00:51:08.369 --> 00:51:11.744
and the sins that through
human frailty he committed,


530
00:51:11.911 --> 00:51:14.369
wash them away with your mercy.

531
00:51:14.536 --> 00:51:15.952
Through Jesus Christ, Our Lord.

532
00:51:16.119 --> 00:51:17.244
Amen.

533
00:51:35.827 --> 00:51:37.827
Since the captain
was sending me to Manila...


534
00:51:37.994 --> 00:51:40.994
The captain's dead.
I'm in charge now.


535
00:51:41.161 --> 00:51:42.994
Of course, Lieutenant,
I was just asking...


536
00:51:43.161 --> 00:51:44.994
Going to Manila is suicide.

537
00:51:45.619 --> 00:51:47.286
They'd have killed you
as soon as you got out.


538
00:51:49.036 --> 00:51:52.161
And I can't lose any more men.

539
00:51:52.327 --> 00:51:54.619
Anything else?

540
00:51:55.411 --> 00:51:56.619
No, Lieutenant.

541
00:51:57.827 --> 00:51:59.244
With your permission...

542
00:52:30.577 --> 00:52:33.702
The heart, liver and offal
are for the sick.


543
00:52:33.869 --> 00:52:36.494
The rest will make a soup
for the others.


544
00:52:36.661 --> 00:52:38.202
Yes, Lieutenant.

545
00:52:50.619 --> 00:52:51.994
It won't go around.

546
00:52:53.327 --> 00:52:56.286
There are too many of us.

547
00:52:56.452 --> 00:52:57.952
Don't think about that.

548
00:52:59.577 --> 00:53:01.161
Thinking makes you weak.

549
00:53:13.744 --> 00:53:15.994
I don't want to be buried here.

550
00:53:16.161 --> 00:53:17.577
No one's going to bury you.

551
00:53:18.744 --> 00:53:20.994
I've seen them being taken away.

552
00:53:21.161 --> 00:53:22.702
Take it easy, son.

553
00:53:22.869 --> 00:53:26.244
Death doesn't take anyone
without God's permission.


554
00:53:26.994 --> 00:53:28.952
And where's God, Father?

555
00:53:29.119 --> 00:53:31.827
Father, give me the brown flask.
Alonso, the washbasin!


556
00:53:36.786 --> 00:53:40.786
I don't care what you snatch,
cabbage, potatoes, anything fresh.


557
00:53:40.952 --> 00:53:44.619
We can't keep waiting here,
we need to stop this beriberi.


558
00:53:46.286 --> 00:53:47.744
Didn't you want to be a hero?

559
00:53:49.161 --> 00:53:52.161
Better this than crossing
the Sierra Madre to Manila.


560
00:53:53.327 --> 00:53:55.077
I can't do it alone, Lieutenant.

561
00:53:58.244 --> 00:54:00.744
Take Jose, it'll do him good.

562
00:54:14.577 --> 00:54:17.244
- I can't take any more.
- Come on, nearly there.


563
00:54:17.411 --> 00:54:19.494
- You go on...
- Shit, Jose!


564
00:54:46.369 --> 00:54:47.744
A dog!

565
00:55:14.619 --> 00:55:18.119
Let's get out of here!
Carlos, they're coming!


566
00:55:28.536 --> 00:55:30.453
Go! Go!

567
00:55:30.619 --> 00:55:32.369
Hurry! Go!

568
00:55:39.869 --> 00:55:42.494
My Virgin! My Virgin!

569
00:55:42.661 --> 00:55:45.119
I have to go back!
Leave me alone!


570
00:55:45.286 --> 00:55:47.411
I have to go out there!

571
00:55:49.244 --> 00:55:51.452
Let me go out there!

572
00:56:20.869 --> 00:56:22.286
We could've brought it in.

573
00:56:23.994 --> 00:56:25.286
What?

574
00:56:25.452 --> 00:56:26.494
The dog.

575
00:56:27.869 --> 00:56:29.327
It was big.

576
00:56:29.494 --> 00:56:32.244
Okay, don't think about that now,

577
00:56:33.161 --> 00:56:34.827
the main thing is to save your arm.

578
00:56:37.161 --> 00:56:39.286
It'll be alright, won't it?

579
00:56:39.452 --> 00:56:41.494
You've always got your left arm.

580
00:56:42.869 --> 00:56:44.911
It's not like you're going
to be Goya, right?


581
00:58:00.286 --> 00:58:02.619
Ever been with a woman?

582
00:58:04.744 --> 00:58:06.369
Why do you ask?

583
00:58:07.577 --> 00:58:08.702
I haven't.

584
00:58:10.952 --> 00:58:12.869
Not even with a bad girl.

585
00:58:19.286 --> 00:58:21.702
My grandfather on my mom's side
died of syphilis.


586
00:58:22.452 --> 00:58:24.202
He was widowed young...

587
00:58:26.327 --> 00:58:27.952
and he was a womanizer.

588
00:58:29.244 --> 00:58:30.827
When he had bad days,
my mother and I


589
00:58:30.994 --> 00:58:33.327
would treat his skin pustules.

590
00:58:36.202 --> 00:58:37.494
It smelt terrible,

591
00:58:39.161 --> 00:58:41.661
like rotting meat.

592
00:58:45.536 --> 00:58:47.536
Do you think that in Heaven...?

593
00:58:47.702 --> 00:58:48.619
No.

594
00:58:51.202 --> 00:58:53.286
How do you know
what I'm going to ask?


595
00:58:54.202 --> 00:58:57.536
Son, our Heaven is boring.

596
00:58:57.702 --> 00:59:00.327
There are no virgins...

597
00:59:01.494 --> 00:59:04.036
or maidens like the Moors have.

598
00:59:04.202 --> 00:59:06.244
Why them and not us?

599
00:59:07.827 --> 00:59:10.452
A good question for the Creator,

600
00:59:12.036 --> 00:59:15.327
but if it's any consolation,

601
00:59:15.494 --> 00:59:18.994
it could be worse.

602
00:59:19.161 --> 00:59:20.286
Worse?

603
00:59:21.327 --> 00:59:23.202
In Oriental religions,

604
00:59:23.827 --> 00:59:25.411
when you die

605
00:59:25.577 --> 00:59:27.952
you start on a road of reincarnation

606
00:59:28.119 --> 00:59:31.244
that may last
for seventy thousand lives.


607
00:59:32.161 --> 00:59:35.952
Some are long,
like those of elephants,


608
00:59:36.119 --> 00:59:39.369
others are short, like those of...

609
00:59:41.327 --> 00:59:42.827
cockroaches.

610
00:59:43.994 --> 00:59:45.827
I don't want to be a cockroach.

611
00:59:45.994 --> 00:59:49.744
Neither do I,
and that's why I thank God


612
00:59:51.036 --> 00:59:54.036
for the blessed fortune
of being a Christian,


613
00:59:55.952 --> 00:59:58.119
even if our Heaven is crap.

614
01:00:35.619 --> 01:00:37.369
We bring oranges.

615
01:00:42.369 --> 01:00:44.452
A gift from Commander Luna.

616
01:00:46.577 --> 01:00:49.494
The Commander says

617
01:00:49.661 --> 01:00:51.286
you can sow next to the church.

618
01:00:51.786 --> 01:00:53.286
It will be friendly territory.

619
01:00:54.327 --> 01:00:55.661
Friendly?

620
01:00:56.952 --> 01:00:59.411
That's what he said... "friendly".

621
01:01:03.994 --> 01:01:06.952
We're not surrendering
for a garden and some oranges.


622
01:01:07.119 --> 01:01:10.411
The Commander asks you
to read these.


623
01:01:12.327 --> 01:01:15.619
They're newspapers from Manila.

624
01:01:26.577 --> 01:01:28.369
The Commander wants peace.

625
01:01:29.411 --> 01:01:32.911
Aren't his men enough?
Now he sends in his whores?


626
01:01:36.286 --> 01:01:38.077
You're a good man, Lieutenant.

627
01:01:38.994 --> 01:01:41.077
I told my people
what you did for me.


628
01:01:42.411 --> 01:01:44.494
- I didn't do anything.
-You saved my life.


629
01:01:45.536 --> 01:01:47.661
Do the same for your soldiers.

630
01:01:49.161 --> 01:01:50.119
Save them.

631
01:01:50.286 --> 01:01:52.452
What I do is none of your business.

632
01:01:52.619 --> 01:01:55.077
We're not spiteful.

633
01:01:56.369 --> 01:01:58.536
I like Spanish men.

634
01:02:01.244 --> 01:02:04.536
Instead of being in there,
locked away,


635
01:02:05.577 --> 01:02:08.911
you could be here, celebrating,

636
01:02:09.952 --> 01:02:11.119
enjoying yourselves.

637
01:02:12.161 --> 01:02:14.494
Get the fuck out of here. Go!

638
01:02:17.161 --> 01:02:18.869
It's all true.

639
01:02:31.119 --> 01:02:32.161
Pick that up.

640
01:03:07.994 --> 01:03:11.661
Hey, slowly, slowly.

641
01:03:15.161 --> 01:03:17.702
I'm just saying they might
take it the wrong way.


642
01:03:17.869 --> 01:03:19.869
Accepting the gifts?

643
01:03:20.827 --> 01:03:21.702
Yes, Lieutenant.

644
01:03:21.869 --> 01:03:24.827
I don't give a shit.
I need strong men,


645
01:03:24.994 --> 01:03:27.911
healthy men, or tell me how
we can defend this church.


646
01:03:28.077 --> 01:03:30.452
- As we have up to now.
- Tell that to Vigil,


647
01:03:30.619 --> 01:03:32.036
his infirmary is full,

648
01:03:32.202 --> 01:03:35.202
tell that to Father Carmelo,
he's sick of giving last rites.


649
01:03:35.744 --> 01:03:36.869
Right.

650
01:03:37.036 --> 01:03:40.286
Or do you want us to keep dying
until you take command?


651
01:03:43.619 --> 01:03:47.202
- I don't know what you mean.
- What's your point?


652
01:03:47.744 --> 01:03:49.577
You can do better than I can?

653
01:03:51.202 --> 01:03:53.161
You think I'm afraid to die here?

654
01:03:54.286 --> 01:03:55.744
I have no one in Spain.

655
01:03:56.161 --> 01:03:59.411
No wife, no children.
I asked to come to this war.


656
01:03:59.619 --> 01:04:01.286
Then do it right, Lieutenant.

657
01:04:01.452 --> 01:04:03.286
As you did when the Tagalog
massacred us?


658
01:04:03.452 --> 01:04:04.994
We fought to the end.

659
01:04:05.161 --> 01:04:09.036
You surrendered.
That's the difference between us.


660
01:04:09.577 --> 01:04:11.536
No one's surrendering here,

661
01:04:11.702 --> 01:04:13.702
whatever happens
or whoever may fall.


662
01:04:18.702 --> 01:04:20.494
Sergeant...

663
01:04:23.577 --> 01:04:25.161
Tear up those pamphlets.

664
01:04:26.827 --> 01:04:28.827
It doesn't leave this room.

665
01:04:45.036 --> 01:04:47.244
DECEMBER 31, 1898
SIX MONTHS OF SIEGE


666
01:04:47.411 --> 01:04:50.411
<i>Spaniards,
today's a day to celebrate.</i>


667
01:04:50.577 --> 01:04:52.577
<i>Lay down arms
and come into town,</i>


668
01:04:52.744 --> 01:04:54.994
<i>we're celebrating.</i>

669
01:04:55.161 --> 01:04:58.411
<i>You can have some fun!
Listen to me and come here!</i>


670
01:04:59.452 --> 01:05:02.911
<i>Look at the women
we have for you!</i>


671
01:05:03.077 --> 01:05:05.119
<i>All of them for you!</i>

672
01:05:05.286 --> 01:05:09.077
<i>When did you last touch a woman?</i>

673
01:05:09.494 --> 01:05:12.494
<i>All this talk of decency!
Forget the priests,</i>


674
01:05:13.202 --> 01:05:15.827
<i>forget Spain
and come into town,</i>


675
01:05:15.994 --> 01:05:17.411
<i>- we're celebrating.</i>
-Father.


676
01:05:17.577 --> 01:05:20.994
Tonight open all the wine.
Let the men celebrate.


677
01:06:00.577 --> 01:06:01.827
Here, son.

678
01:06:05.411 --> 01:06:07.619
There isn't much left.

679
01:06:07.786 --> 01:06:08.786
No.

680
01:06:09.827 --> 01:06:11.827
There's enough here to say
goodbye to the year.


681
01:06:11.994 --> 01:06:14.202
I mean the opium.

682
01:06:14.369 --> 01:06:15.369
What?

683
01:06:16.494 --> 01:06:19.661
Up to now, it's helped us hold on.

684
01:06:21.077 --> 01:06:23.869
But when it's gone,
we must be strong, very strong.


685
01:06:24.036 --> 01:06:27.786
Especially here.

686
01:06:31.119 --> 01:06:34.536
The first days are the worst,
but it'll pass.


687
01:06:35.577 --> 01:06:36.952
Everything passes.

688
01:07:05.869 --> 01:07:06.577
Here.

689
01:07:07.702 --> 01:07:08.702
Go on, cheer up.

690
01:07:09.744 --> 01:07:11.827
To us,
getting out of this church alive.


691
01:07:22.494 --> 01:07:25.869
Vigil, has anyone seen
Father Carmelo?


692
01:07:26.036 --> 01:07:28.661
I left him in the sacristy,
visiting the sick.


693
01:07:28.827 --> 01:07:30.869
Find him so he can bless
the New Year.


694
01:07:32.827 --> 01:07:35.369
Go and get him.

695
01:07:38.202 --> 01:07:39.202
Father...

696
01:07:42.952 --> 01:07:43.994
Father.

697
01:07:45.952 --> 01:07:47.161
Father, what have you done?

698
01:07:47.327 --> 01:07:50.369
Carlos, is he down there?

699
01:07:53.661 --> 01:07:56.286
Carlos, have you found
Father Carmelo?


700
01:07:58.327 --> 01:07:59.411
He's here!

701
01:08:01.786 --> 01:08:02.911
Get Vigil.

702
01:08:03.786 --> 01:08:06.994
- Get Vigil.
- Oh, fuck...


703
01:08:26.494 --> 01:08:29.119
May his soul rest in peace.
Amen.


704
01:11:29.202 --> 01:11:31.661
- Lieutenant.
- Get some rest. Everyone.


705
01:11:31.827 --> 01:11:33.911
- We're on guard until...
- That's an order.


706
01:11:50.494 --> 01:11:52.827
<i>...I need your kisses...</i>

707
01:11:52.994 --> 01:11:54.577
<i>...I need...</i>

708
01:12:05.744 --> 01:12:09.077
<i>I will tell you...</i>

709
01:13:36.077 --> 01:13:39.577
Artillery fire! 
Artillery fire!

710
01:13:39.744 --> 01:13:40.994
They're shelling us!

711
01:13:43.077 --> 01:13:45.869
- Someone to the bell tower!
- Let's go! Get up!


712
01:13:46.036 --> 01:13:48.453
- To your posts!
- Go! Hurry!


713
01:13:48.619 --> 01:13:50.744
- Come on, go!
- They've got a cannon.


714
01:13:50.911 --> 01:13:54.036
- Where'd they get it from?
- Hurry!


715
01:13:54.202 --> 01:13:55.702
Let's go, hurry!

716
01:13:57.536 --> 01:13:58.953
Fire!

717
01:14:04.494 --> 01:14:07.911
- What's happening?
- Take cover! Get down!


718
01:14:12.827 --> 01:14:14.036
What do we do?

719
01:14:15.494 --> 01:14:18.161
- The cannon's out of range.
- Then what?


720
01:14:21.119 --> 01:14:23.661
Fire!

721
01:15:03.827 --> 01:15:06.911
"You see the attacks
the Devil and the world


722
01:15:07.077 --> 01:15:09.994
make everywhere on the faith,

723
01:15:10.161 --> 01:15:13.786
in which, to gain eternal glory,

724
01:15:13.952 --> 01:15:16.827
we desire, by the grace of God

725
01:15:16.994 --> 01:15:19.119
to live and die.

726
01:15:20.869 --> 01:15:24.119
You, the aid of Christians,

727
01:15:24.286 --> 01:15:27.036
renew, for your sons' salvation,

728
01:15:27.202 --> 01:15:29.077
the ancient victories..."

729
01:15:39.994 --> 01:15:42.702
Help me! Help me!

730
01:15:44.119 --> 01:15:47.452
"They pledge to you
the firm intention..."


731
01:15:47.619 --> 01:15:51.244
We'll never get out of here,
we'll die one by one


732
01:15:51.411 --> 01:15:55.411
- today, tomorrow, in a week...
- Shut the fuck up!


733
01:16:00.161 --> 01:16:02.161
We must go out and fight,

734
01:16:02.911 --> 01:16:05.369
fight like men.

735
01:16:05.786 --> 01:16:07.994
We put powder in the breech,
seal it


736
01:16:08.161 --> 01:16:10.036
and blow the cannon sky high.

737
01:16:10.202 --> 01:16:12.619
- How do we get to the cannon?
- With balls,


738
01:16:12.827 --> 01:16:14.244
what you're all lacking.

739
01:16:14.411 --> 01:16:16.661
I need every man
in fighting condition.


740
01:16:16.827 --> 01:16:18.952
It'll only be one, short attack.

741
01:16:19.119 --> 01:16:20.869
If it goes wrong, it's all over,

742
01:16:21.036 --> 01:16:23.869
there'll be no one in any state
to defend the church,


743
01:16:24.036 --> 01:16:25.994
but if it succeeds...

744
01:16:26.286 --> 01:16:27.786
<i>We'll go in two groups</i>

745
01:16:27.952 --> 01:16:31.077
<i>so they think there are more
of us and the surprise is greater.</i>


746
01:16:31.244 --> 01:16:34.994
<i>I'll attack on the right flank,
Sergeant Jimeno, the left.</i>


747
01:16:35.161 --> 01:16:37.744
<i>I'll give you time
to take your positions.</i>


748
01:16:37.911 --> 01:16:39.536
<i>We can't risk any signals.</i>

749
01:16:39.702 --> 01:16:41.952
<i>Wait for me to open fire.</i>

750
01:17:00.827 --> 01:17:03.286
How long do we wait here?

751
01:17:03.452 --> 01:17:06.786
- Until the lieutenant opens fire.
- What's he waiting for?


752
01:17:19.244 --> 01:17:21.119
What's wrong with you?

753
01:17:22.411 --> 01:17:23.952
Nothing.

754
01:17:24.119 --> 01:17:25.161
Nothing?

755
01:17:27.244 --> 01:17:30.369
You're not thinking of deserting
and joining your pal?


756
01:17:30.702 --> 01:17:33.702
No, I'm not thinking of anything.

757
01:17:42.077 --> 01:17:44.202
- What's that?
- What?


758
01:17:45.827 --> 01:17:47.744
Hear that?

759
01:17:47.911 --> 01:17:49.244
It's a buffalo.

760
01:17:49.411 --> 01:17:50.869
Get out of the way, fuck!

761
01:18:07.619 --> 01:18:09.869
What the hell are you doing?

762
01:18:15.786 --> 01:18:17.411
Cover his mouth
so he doesn't scream.


763
01:18:22.036 --> 01:18:23.452
Tie him up on the ground.

764
01:18:24.827 --> 01:18:27.161
Sergeant, there are crocodiles.

765
01:18:28.161 --> 01:18:29.661
Is he your son?

766
01:18:35.161 --> 01:18:37.619
The cannon!
What are you waiting for?


767
01:19:18.869 --> 01:19:19.911
Cut it out.

768
01:19:20.952 --> 01:19:22.869
Stop it!

769
01:19:25.077 --> 01:19:26.869
He's dead, can't you see?

770
01:19:32.077 --> 01:19:34.827
Go, getaway! Go!

771
01:19:46.244 --> 01:19:49.577
- There, behind that cabin!
- Fire! Fire over there!


772
01:19:50.869 --> 01:19:53.119
Where are you going? Halt!

773
01:19:53.827 --> 01:19:55.619
- What are you doing, Sergeant?
- He's running off! Fuck!


774
01:19:56.411 --> 01:19:58.994
Here! Help me!

775
01:19:59.161 --> 01:20:02.994
- I can't control them!
- We have to go now! Let's go!


776
01:20:03.744 --> 01:20:06.161
- They're regrouping!
- C'mon, grab it all! Go!


777
01:20:07.702 --> 01:20:10.827
Grab any food you can find!

778
01:20:12.036 --> 01:20:14.036
Go, Jimeno!
Carlos and I will cover you.


779
01:20:14.202 --> 01:20:16.327
Move it! Go!

780
01:20:16.494 --> 01:20:17.786
Let's go!

781
01:20:21.244 --> 01:20:24.286
The fire will cover us.
We'll burn the whole town down.


782
01:20:26.286 --> 01:20:27.702
Burn it all down.

783
01:20:34.952 --> 01:20:37.244
Carlos, we have to go now!

784
01:20:40.411 --> 01:20:42.286
- We can win the war!
- Carlos...


785
01:20:44.452 --> 01:20:45.827
We can win it.

786
01:21:31.452 --> 01:21:32.702
What happened?

787
01:21:34.244 --> 01:21:35.952
The sergeant found something.

788
01:21:37.119 --> 01:21:39.411
It was hidden in
a sack in the basement.


789
01:21:40.452 --> 01:21:43.286
- How long have you been smoking it?
- I don't know what you mean.


790
01:21:43.452 --> 01:21:44.786
You don't?

791
01:21:44.952 --> 01:21:46.702
- You're sick.
- No.


792
01:21:46.869 --> 01:21:49.494
- You think we're idiots?
- You're sick! Don't deny it.


793
01:21:49.661 --> 01:21:52.203
- Dilated pupils, goose bumps...
- It's not true!


794
01:21:52.369 --> 01:21:55.244
- Take him to the basement.
- We could cure him here.


795
01:21:55.411 --> 01:21:57.411
- Leave me alone!
- No! To the basement!


796
01:21:57.577 --> 01:22:00.369
C'mon, to the basement.

797
01:22:00.536 --> 01:22:03.494
Let's go! Come on!

798
01:22:04.036 --> 01:22:06.869
Let me go! Let me go!

799
01:22:10.161 --> 01:22:10.827
No!

800
01:22:14.619 --> 01:22:17.161
- Don't do this to me, Lieutenant!
- The worst thing is the anxiety.


801
01:22:17.327 --> 01:22:19.536
Keep your mind busy.

802
01:22:19.702 --> 01:22:21.244
No...

803
01:22:21.411 --> 01:22:24.411
Don't leave me here!
Oh God, I'm begging you!


804
01:22:24.577 --> 01:22:27.619
Don't leave me here!
I'm begging you!


805
01:22:27.786 --> 01:22:31.286
I'm begging you...

806
01:22:44.536 --> 01:22:46.619
Fine wine all around!

807
01:24:15.244 --> 01:24:17.244
MAY 18, 1899

808
01:24:17.411 --> 01:24:19.827
TEN MONTHS OF SIEGE

809
01:24:33.327 --> 01:24:34.536
Welcome to the world.

810
01:24:35.577 --> 01:24:36.702
Everything alright?

811
01:24:41.911 --> 01:24:43.452
Hey, at last!

812
01:24:52.452 --> 01:24:53.786
A little wine?

813
01:24:54.827 --> 01:24:57.952
Eat. Get your strength back.

814
01:25:12.661 --> 01:25:14.744
A ship!

815
01:25:14.911 --> 01:25:17.494
A ship in the bay!

816
01:25:19.369 --> 01:25:20.202
Is it Spanish?

817
01:25:26.786 --> 01:25:29.202
It's not a Spanish patrol boat.

818
01:25:35.786 --> 01:25:38.494
It's a lieutenant colonel's uniform,
but it's obsolete.


819
01:25:39.077 --> 01:25:40.494
This looks like a set-up.

820
01:25:42.161 --> 01:25:44.619
Let's see what he has to say.

821
01:25:44.786 --> 01:25:46.619
Don't let him come any closer.

822
01:25:48.327 --> 01:25:50.911
It's just one man.
Are we that frightened?


823
01:25:54.119 --> 01:25:57.744
Moisés and Pedro,
cover us from the front door.


824
01:26:02.494 --> 01:26:05.369
Cristóbal Aguilar y Castañeda,
Lt. Colonel in the Spanish Army,


825
01:26:05.536 --> 01:26:07.202
under orders from General Rios.

826
01:26:07.369 --> 01:26:09.994
Lieutenant Martín Cerezo,

827
01:26:10.244 --> 01:26:13.494
I'm here to give this document
to Captain Las Morenas.


828
01:26:13.661 --> 01:26:15.911
Captain Las Morenas is indisposed.

829
01:26:16.077 --> 01:26:17.494
What does that mean?

830
01:26:17.661 --> 01:26:19.161
He can't receive you,

831
01:26:19.994 --> 01:26:22.494
but you can speak to me.

832
01:26:22.661 --> 01:26:25.327
- Let me inside the church.
- We'll talk here.


833
01:26:25.494 --> 01:26:26.952
- What did you say?
- We'll talk here.


834
01:26:27.119 --> 01:26:30.952
Who do you think you're talking to?
I'm your superior officer.


835
01:26:31.786 --> 01:26:34.286
Who advised you?
That uniform is obsolete.


836
01:26:36.577 --> 01:26:39.869
I order you to let me
into the church at once!


837
01:26:42.369 --> 01:26:45.577
Do you want me to report you
for insubordination?


838
01:26:47.744 --> 01:26:50.661
I'm here to give the order
to hand over this position.


839
01:26:50.827 --> 01:26:52.119
Read it yourself.

840
01:26:52.286 --> 01:26:54.411
How do I know it's legitimate?

841
01:26:54.577 --> 01:26:56.119
It has General Rios' signature.

842
01:26:56.286 --> 01:26:57.744
Anyone can forge a signature.

843
01:27:01.994 --> 01:27:05.036
This is a copy of "El Imparcial",
a Spanish newspaper.


844
01:27:05.411 --> 01:27:07.911
It has news on
the loss of the colonies.


845
01:27:08.077 --> 01:27:10.077
- You think I forged that tool?
- Save your newspapers,


846
01:27:10.244 --> 01:27:12.952
- they've brought us others.
- You're acting like a fool!


847
01:27:13.119 --> 01:27:16.119
I'm covered by article 748
of the field regulations:


848
01:27:16.286 --> 01:27:18.286
"An order in writing to surrender

849
01:27:18.452 --> 01:27:20.036
must not be obeyed
until verified as authentic".


850
01:27:20.202 --> 01:27:22.411
Call Captain Las Morenas,
he knows me.


851
01:27:22.577 --> 01:27:23.452
That's not going to happen.

852
01:27:23.619 --> 01:27:26.036
Why defend a position
that no longer belongs to Spain?


853
01:27:26.202 --> 01:27:28.411
Then why attack us like this?

854
01:27:28.577 --> 01:27:32.577
The Filipinos attack because
you've no right to be here.


855
01:27:32.744 --> 01:27:34.452
Read the damned document!

856
01:27:34.619 --> 01:27:37.036
It says that Spain ceded,
last December 10th,


857
01:27:37.202 --> 01:27:39.952
all of its Overseas Territories
to the United States.


858
01:27:40.119 --> 01:27:43.452
Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Philippines
have lost Spanish sovereignty.


859
01:27:44.577 --> 01:27:46.869
Your mission here is over.

860
01:27:47.202 --> 01:27:49.119
See for yourself.

861
01:27:52.661 --> 01:27:55.077
When you're convinced,
raise the white flag.


862
01:27:55.244 --> 01:27:58.244
The sooner we end this insanity,
the better it is for everyone.


863
01:28:04.702 --> 01:28:07.494
<i>"On receipt of an order
in writing from a superior</i>


864
01:28:07.661 --> 01:28:09.911
to surrender a position,
its execution is suspended


865
01:28:10.077 --> 01:28:12.286
until authenticity is verified,

866
01:28:12.452 --> 01:28:13.911
by sending, if possible,

867
01:28:14.077 --> 01:28:16.994
a person of trust
to check it verbally."


868
01:28:17.161 --> 01:28:19.786
I'm not falling for this,
least of all now.


869
01:28:19.952 --> 01:28:21.952
The tone and phrasing sound real.

870
01:28:22.119 --> 01:28:24.577
They want it to sound real.

871
01:28:24.744 --> 01:28:26.994
But he asked to see the captain,
he said he knew him.


872
01:28:27.161 --> 01:28:27.952
And...?

873
01:28:28.119 --> 01:28:31.202
If you're lying you don't risk
saying something that can be proven.


874
01:28:31.369 --> 01:28:33.702
Only we know
that Enrique is dead.


875
01:28:33.869 --> 01:28:35.994
He's smart.
He was sent to confuse us.


876
01:28:36.161 --> 01:28:37.577
- What if he's telling the truth?
- He's lying!


877
01:28:37.744 --> 01:28:39.119
We don't know that!

878
01:28:41.077 --> 01:28:42.911
If the Field Marshal sent him,
he would've come


879
01:28:43.077 --> 01:28:45.536
on a Spanish patrol boat
and not alone.


880
01:28:52.286 --> 01:28:55.911
If this document is true, we've been fighting
for almost a year for the hell of it.


881
01:28:56.077 --> 01:28:59.619
Nobody's fighting for the hell of it!
We're defending ourselves


882
01:28:59.786 --> 01:29:01.536
from men firing a cannon at us!

883
01:29:55.952 --> 01:29:58.244
<i>You've lost your last chance</i>

884
01:29:58.411 --> 01:30:01.119
<i>to get out alive, 
Spaniards.</i>

885
01:30:01.411 --> 01:30:02.786
Your last chance!

886
01:30:06.994 --> 01:30:08.452
You've been shut in there
for a year


887
01:30:08.619 --> 01:30:11.036
while Spain is laughing at you!

888
01:30:12.536 --> 01:30:14.911
You're not going to die for Spain!

889
01:30:15.286 --> 01:30:17.286
You're going to die
because you're idiots!


890
01:30:18.161 --> 01:30:21.911
That's what you are,
a bunch of idiots!


891
01:30:22.077 --> 01:30:24.619
Fuck you! Fuck you all!

892
01:30:25.952 --> 01:30:27.702
You know how
you'll be remembered?


893
01:30:28.744 --> 01:30:30.619
How you'll go down in history?

894
01:30:32.077 --> 01:30:34.911
You'll be known
as the nitwits of Baler!


895
01:30:36.702 --> 01:30:38.786
The pigs of Baler! Fuck!

896
01:30:47.661 --> 01:30:49.952
Why doesn't he go back to Spain?

897
01:30:50.119 --> 01:30:53.536
He can't. If he went back
without us, they'd shoot him.


898
01:30:53.702 --> 01:30:54.702
Sure.

899
01:30:56.452 --> 01:30:58.536
We're at war, aren't we?

900
01:31:03.744 --> 01:31:06.327
Fire! Go!

901
01:31:06.494 --> 01:31:08.619
Don't let them get close!

902
01:31:08.786 --> 01:31:12.244
Fire, damn it! Fire!

903
01:31:44.036 --> 01:31:46.702
Lieutenant...

904
01:31:50.744 --> 01:31:52.911
I want to comply with regulations.

905
01:31:53.077 --> 01:31:53.952
Excuse me?

906
01:31:54.119 --> 01:31:57.702
I'll be the person of trust that
goes to check if it's true.


907
01:31:57.869 --> 01:31:59.661
How will you check it?

908
01:32:00.536 --> 01:32:02.619
I'll go to Manila, Lieutenant.

909
01:32:03.744 --> 01:32:05.619
Have you been smoking the opium again?

910
01:32:07.577 --> 01:32:10.536
- If we'd listened to the captain...
- You'd be dead.


911
01:32:11.494 --> 01:32:14.411
- That's what would've happened.
- We can't keep waiting here.


912
01:32:14.577 --> 01:32:17.411
Are you looking for
your exemplary service letter?


913
01:32:18.369 --> 01:32:20.369
Your mayor tricked you, Carlos.

914
01:32:20.536 --> 01:32:22.994
That school won't take
people like you.


915
01:32:23.161 --> 01:32:24.827
If we stay here, we'll die.

916
01:32:26.077 --> 01:32:27.911
You won't make it to Manila alive.

917
01:32:34.661 --> 01:32:36.869
You're coming back, aren't you?

918
01:32:37.994 --> 01:32:39.202
Of course.

919
01:32:40.494 --> 01:32:42.452
I'll bring reinforcements.

920
01:32:42.619 --> 01:32:44.536
There won't be anyone in Manila.

921
01:32:44.786 --> 01:32:45.786
It doesn't matter.

922
01:32:46.869 --> 01:32:49.327
I'll be back.

923
01:36:50.036 --> 01:36:51.244
Well, well...

924
01:36:53.161 --> 01:36:55.744
Where'd he come from?

925
01:36:58.577 --> 01:37:00.119
Where were you headed?

926
01:37:00.577 --> 01:37:01.244
Manila.

927
01:37:01.411 --> 01:37:03.161
There are no Spaniards in Manila.

928
01:37:04.036 --> 01:37:06.369
My army?

929
01:37:07.911 --> 01:37:09.702
Your army...

930
01:37:09.869 --> 01:37:12.327
sold the Philippines to the Americans.

931
01:37:14.786 --> 01:37:17.369
Now we're fighting them.

932
01:37:21.327 --> 01:37:23.036
You're not allies anymore?

933
01:37:23.202 --> 01:37:25.202
They didn't come to help,

934
01:37:26.702 --> 01:37:28.411
they came to stay.

935
01:37:36.036 --> 01:37:38.911
You didn't know
what was going on at all


936
01:37:39.077 --> 01:37:41.744
inside that church, did you?

937
01:37:43.202 --> 01:37:45.577
You're alone, soldier.
There's no empire,


938
01:37:45.827 --> 01:37:49.244
no army, no glory to defend.

939
01:37:51.952 --> 01:37:53.994
My war is not with you.

940
01:37:59.577 --> 01:38:01.036
You're not my prisoner.

941
01:38:02.077 --> 01:38:05.327
If you insist on going to Manila,
I'll give you a horse.


942
01:38:05.494 --> 01:38:07.369
But there's nothing there.

943
01:38:18.786 --> 01:38:20.994
If you go back to the church,
you're a fool.


944
01:38:23.119 --> 01:38:24.536
I'm not a fool,

945
01:38:25.577 --> 01:38:27.327
nor am I a traitor.

946
01:38:31.786 --> 01:38:35.119
A traitor to what... and to whom?

947
01:38:35.702 --> 01:38:38.911
Spain sold the Philippines
to the Yankees!


948
01:38:39.077 --> 01:38:42.369
Our government sold the Philippines
for 20 million dollars!


949
01:38:42.536 --> 01:38:45.036
All these heroics
and shit they got us to do,


950
01:38:45.202 --> 01:38:48.661
and in the end what counted
was money. As usual!


951
01:38:52.994 --> 01:38:56.202
And what do you think they'll do
with all that money?


952
01:38:56.369 --> 01:38:59.869
Give it to the families of the dead
in Cuba, the Philippines,


953
01:39:00.036 --> 01:39:01.369
Puerto Rico?

954
01:39:04.744 --> 01:39:07.952
Will they give it to your mother
when you're buried here?


955
01:39:09.161 --> 01:39:10.244
No.

956
01:39:11.286 --> 01:39:13.661
They'll keep it for themselves.

957
01:39:13.827 --> 01:39:16.702
They don't give a shit
about us, Carlos.


958
01:39:20.786 --> 01:39:23.952
If you want to give your life for
some dirt bag then that's up to you.


959
01:40:05.536 --> 01:40:08.202
It's all lies! You weren't going
to try to reach Manila?


960
01:40:08.369 --> 01:40:10.952
Manila is occupied by the Americans.

961
01:40:11.119 --> 01:40:14.869
The Filipinos are fighting them.
We've got no business here.


962
01:40:15.036 --> 01:40:17.327
That's for me to decide!

963
01:40:18.661 --> 01:40:19.952
Do you really think

964
01:40:20.119 --> 01:40:23.536
anyone would take the trouble
to forge all these papers


965
01:40:23.702 --> 01:40:25.202
for us, for this church?

966
01:40:25.369 --> 01:40:27.452
Can't you see they're full of lies?!

967
01:40:28.494 --> 01:40:30.202
20 million for Puerto Rico
and the Philippines?


968
01:40:30.369 --> 01:40:32.369
What kind of deal is that?

969
01:40:32.536 --> 01:40:36.369
You've got education and sense.
Would you do business this way?


970
01:40:36.536 --> 01:40:39.661
They're telling us that
they're willing to buy us,


971
01:40:39.827 --> 01:40:41.702
that our surrender has a price,

972
01:40:42.077 --> 01:40:44.577
and that insults
the memory of our dead.


973
01:40:46.286 --> 01:40:48.536
Not to mention that stupid
naval battle in Santiago de Cuba.


974
01:40:48.702 --> 01:40:51.869
You don't need a degree to know that
if your ships aren't battle-ready


975
01:40:52.036 --> 01:40:55.244
they stay in port and defend the bay
from land. It's common sense.


976
01:40:55.411 --> 01:40:56.661
Common sense!

977
01:40:57.702 --> 01:41:00.327
Do you think our leaders
in Madrid have common sense?


978
01:41:01.661 --> 01:41:05.286
They sent me here
not knowing how to shoot,


979
01:41:05.452 --> 01:41:07.827
- and with no boots...
- This is different.


980
01:41:07.994 --> 01:41:11.661
One thing is being inept,
another is what these papers say.


981
01:41:11.827 --> 01:41:14.952
If someone gave the order to face
the American fleet in those conditions,


982
01:41:15.119 --> 01:41:16.702
they should be shot for treason.

983
01:41:18.244 --> 01:41:20.036
Do you think we're led by a traitor?

984
01:41:21.452 --> 01:41:24.286
No, Lieutenant, not a traitor,

985
01:41:25.869 --> 01:41:27.577
an incompetent.

986
01:41:27.911 --> 01:41:29.702
I'm neither one nor the other.

987
01:41:30.952 --> 01:41:34.369
And until I know for sure what's
going on outside, I'll keep fighting.


988
01:41:37.702 --> 01:41:38.952
Dismissed.

989
01:41:48.952 --> 01:41:50.119
I don't know.

990
01:41:53.244 --> 01:41:54.411
You don't know?

991
01:41:55.494 --> 01:41:56.952
It's risky.

992
01:41:57.119 --> 01:42:00.036
Risky? Staying here is risky.

993
01:42:00.536 --> 01:42:02.536
It's only two hundred yards.

994
01:42:02.702 --> 01:42:04.369
They'll shoot us in the back.

995
01:42:05.244 --> 01:42:07.286
No, they won't.

996
01:42:11.911 --> 01:42:13.994
I don't want to fight
in any more wars.


997
01:42:14.161 --> 01:42:16.577
What if the Filipinos make us
fight the Americans?


998
01:42:16.744 --> 01:42:18.661
They gave me their word.

999
01:42:18.827 --> 01:42:22.577
If we surrender they'll let us
leave the Philippines.


1000
01:42:24.036 --> 01:42:25.661
I don't want to end up like Juan,

1001
01:42:25.827 --> 01:42:29.286
- unable to go home.
- Staying here is madness.


1002
01:42:31.661 --> 01:42:32.869
And I'm not mad.

1003
01:44:22.577 --> 01:44:24.911
On your knees! 
On the ground!

1004
01:44:25.077 --> 01:44:26.744
On your knees, the three of you!

1005
01:44:28.994 --> 01:44:31.452
I knew you'd run off eventually.

1006
01:44:32.619 --> 01:44:33.911
Right?

1007
01:44:37.494 --> 01:44:39.786
Do you know the penalty for treason?

1008
01:44:41.411 --> 01:44:42.411
Do you?

1009
01:44:48.161 --> 01:44:49.286
Halt!

1010
01:44:50.577 --> 01:44:52.369
Halt!

1011
01:45:07.202 --> 01:45:10.744
You want to give us to the Tagalog
so they can machete us?


1012
01:45:11.536 --> 01:45:13.786
Is that what you wanted?

1013
01:45:47.536 --> 01:45:49.827
I won't have you shot, Carlos.

1014
01:45:49.994 --> 01:45:51.619
I don't shoot wounded men.

1015
01:45:53.994 --> 01:45:55.577
What about Jose and Carvajal?

1016
01:46:02.244 --> 01:46:03.744
They'll be executed.

1017
01:46:05.536 --> 01:46:08.119
- I convinced them to run away.
- We're doing it tomorrow


1018
01:46:08.744 --> 01:46:10.952
- in the courtyard.
- We're not at war.


1019
01:46:11.244 --> 01:46:14.286
- You'll hear it from here.
-You're wrong! You're wrong!


1020
01:46:14.661 --> 01:46:17.369
I saved your life twice, Carlos.

1021
01:46:17.994 --> 01:46:20.494
When I didn't send you to Manila,
as the captain wanted,


1022
01:46:20.827 --> 01:46:22.869
and when I carried you back
on my shoulders.


1023
01:46:24.702 --> 01:46:26.577
Which time was I wrong?

1024
01:46:33.744 --> 01:46:34.786
No...

1025
01:46:35.827 --> 01:46:36.869
No...

1026
01:46:51.161 --> 01:46:53.744
Shooting those soldiers
will cause a mutiny.


1027
01:46:55.202 --> 01:46:56.577
They're deserters.

1028
01:46:57.619 --> 01:47:00.369
They've fought for a year,
like the others.


1029
01:47:00.536 --> 01:47:03.161
- The field regulations...
- Screw the field regulations!


1030
01:47:03.327 --> 01:47:06.036
You don't want to see
what's happening.


1031
01:47:06.869 --> 01:47:08.661
You'd really put two soldiers
against a wall


1032
01:47:08.827 --> 01:47:12.536
and tell six others to kill them?

1033
01:47:36.327 --> 01:47:37.952
Moisés.

1034
01:47:38.244 --> 01:47:40.994
- Get your rifle and follow us.
- What?


1035
01:47:41.161 --> 01:47:43.161
Your rifle, get it.

1036
01:47:46.077 --> 01:47:47.286
You go to sleep.

1037
01:48:13.702 --> 01:48:15.536
Lieutenant, this is illegal.

1038
01:48:17.827 --> 01:48:19.244
This way they won't suffer.

1039
01:48:19.661 --> 01:48:21.411
That's why I'm doing it, Moises,

1040
01:48:23.077 --> 01:48:24.911
so they don't suffer.

1041
01:48:37.244 --> 01:48:38.786
Aim.

1042
01:48:47.702 --> 01:48:50.327
Aim. That's an order.

1043
01:49:17.452 --> 01:49:18.744
Fire.

1044
01:50:27.244 --> 01:50:30.702
Aim at the officer! Go!

1045
01:51:45.619 --> 01:51:47.077
You have to aim!

1046
01:51:48.369 --> 01:51:50.577
Wounded to the spare beds!

1047
01:52:37.494 --> 01:52:41.494
PERSONNEL TRANSFERS

1048
01:52:54.202 --> 01:52:55.577
What's wrong, Private?

1049
01:52:56.619 --> 01:52:59.077
You didn't have the balls
to run off after all, eh?


1050
01:52:59.244 --> 01:53:00.244
Are you alright?

1051
01:53:02.202 --> 01:53:04.702
You still have time, right, Private?

1052
01:53:04.869 --> 01:53:07.411
Stop talking!

1053
01:53:31.536 --> 01:53:33.286
It's the surrender order.

1054
01:53:42.786 --> 01:53:44.827
Not because they've defeated me.

1055
01:53:49.536 --> 01:53:51.744
We have enough ammunition
for two more months,


1056
01:53:53.327 --> 01:53:55.702
and this wall can be repaired.

1057
01:54:20.786 --> 01:54:22.577
I found a news item.

1058
01:54:23.036 --> 01:54:24.577
Real news.

1059
01:54:26.827 --> 01:54:28.036
On page 3.

1060
01:54:28.661 --> 01:54:30.619
"Personnel Transfers".

1061
01:54:34.244 --> 01:54:37.202
They're commissions
for infantry officers.


1062
01:54:37.369 --> 01:54:39.494
One of them is Francisco Díaz.

1063
01:54:44.411 --> 01:54:46.786
He's been posted
to the barracks in Málaga.


1064
01:54:50.119 --> 01:54:51.202
And?

1065
01:54:52.327 --> 01:54:54.911
I've known Francisco for 14 years.

1066
01:54:55.077 --> 01:54:58.619
We served in
the 17th Bourbon Regiment.


1067
01:55:04.119 --> 01:55:07.119
I know he always wanted
to be posted to Málaga.


1068
01:55:08.494 --> 01:55:10.202
So...?

1069
01:55:10.369 --> 01:55:13.244
This news can't be fake.

1070
01:55:13.411 --> 01:55:16.369
I've been going over it...

1071
01:55:17.911 --> 01:55:20.661
and however much I rattle my brain,

1072
01:55:24.119 --> 01:55:26.952
the Filipinos couldn't have known
what it says there.


1073
01:55:27.119 --> 01:55:30.036
No. There's no way.

1074
01:55:33.119 --> 01:55:34.661
Stupid, isn't it?

1075
01:55:35.786 --> 01:55:37.786
An absurd piece of news,

1076
01:55:41.619 --> 01:55:43.244
an notice about transfers...

1077
01:55:43.411 --> 01:55:45.994
...proves that the newspapers
are telling the truth.


1078
01:55:51.036 --> 01:55:53.369
- How does it feel, Lieutenant?
- I complied with


1079
01:55:53.536 --> 01:55:57.161
- the field regulations.
- I'm asking you how it feels.


1080
01:55:57.327 --> 01:55:59.119
I may have been wrong, Carlos.

1081
01:55:59.702 --> 01:56:02.785
I may have made mistakes,
but my conscience is clear.


1082
01:56:09.036 --> 01:56:10.369
Then say it.

1083
01:56:13.202 --> 01:56:14.286
Say:

1084
01:56:15.369 --> 01:56:17.536
"The Filipinos were right.

1085
01:56:19.577 --> 01:56:22.702
The newspapers
were telling the truth."


1086
01:56:24.744 --> 01:56:25.702
Say it.

1087
01:56:25.869 --> 01:56:27.661
We lost the war, Carlos.

1088
01:56:27.827 --> 01:56:31.036
Our army surrendered and we lost.

1089
01:56:31.202 --> 01:56:34.619
That's the only truth.

1090
01:56:58.661 --> 01:57:02.661
JUNE 2, 1899
ELEVEN MONTHS OF SIEGE


1091
01:57:06.661 --> 01:57:09.911
We've got nothing white.
I suppose it'll do.


1092
01:57:21.202 --> 01:57:24.077
Go to the courtyard and sound
assembly and surrender.


1093
01:57:28.452 --> 01:57:29.661
You raise the flag.

1094
01:58:32.327 --> 01:58:34.619
Commander.

1095
01:58:34.952 --> 01:58:36.286
Lieutenant.

1096
01:58:36.452 --> 01:58:38.619
This is the surrender order.

1097
01:58:41.327 --> 01:58:44.286
I only have one condition,
and I will not budge on this.


1098
01:58:44.869 --> 01:58:46.202
I'm listening.

1099
01:58:47.327 --> 01:58:50.202
We will not be taken prisoner
or hand over our weapons.


1100
01:58:50.369 --> 01:58:53.661
- You think we seek vengeance?
- A lot of men have died.


1101
01:58:53.827 --> 01:58:57.119
More on my side than yours,
Lieutenant.


1102
01:58:57.619 --> 01:58:59.869
But my men are not
outlaws or murderers,


1103
01:59:00.202 --> 01:59:02.411
and I think we've shown you that.

1104
01:59:06.744 --> 01:59:08.786
We don't need prisoners,

1105
01:59:10.036 --> 01:59:11.661
and as for your weapons,

1106
01:59:12.286 --> 01:59:15.744
you can take them to
the end of my jurisdiction.


1107
01:59:15.911 --> 01:59:17.786
After that,

1108
01:59:17.952 --> 01:59:20.202
you'll have to negotiate
with the Americans.


1109
01:59:41.036 --> 01:59:44.327
I'll ask my men to bid you farewell
with a guard of honor.


1110
01:59:48.994 --> 01:59:50.327
A guard of honor?

1111
01:59:51.369 --> 01:59:54.869
It's been four centuries, Lieutenant.

1112
02:00:11.702 --> 02:00:12.869
Lieutenant...

1113
02:00:14.202 --> 02:00:16.827
I've been going over
the death certificates.


1114
02:00:18.244 --> 02:00:21.411
I'd be grateful if the executed men
weren't listed as such.


1115
02:00:21.952 --> 02:00:24.077
I'm thinking about their families.

1116
02:00:25.452 --> 02:00:28.744
In their families
or what your superiors will say?


1117
02:00:31.452 --> 02:00:34.619
Say they died of beriberi.

1118
02:00:36.702 --> 02:00:39.661
I'll put down the real cause,
it's my duty.


1119
02:00:45.911 --> 02:00:47.411
Soldiers!

1120
02:00:48.619 --> 02:00:50.119
Fix yourselves up right.

1121
02:00:52.119 --> 02:00:53.702
When you go outside...

1122
02:00:56.661 --> 02:00:57.994
look up to the sky.

1123
02:00:59.952 --> 02:01:03.536
While we're at it ask God
where He's been all this time, huh?


1124
02:01:12.952 --> 02:01:14.244
To hell with Spain!

1125
02:01:32.286 --> 02:01:33.494
This is for you,

1126
02:01:36.244 --> 02:01:38.452
a letter of exemplary conduct.

1127
02:01:40.994 --> 02:01:42.369
Is this a joke?

1128
02:01:47.494 --> 02:01:49.286
I did one for each man.

1129
02:01:52.244 --> 02:01:54.994
Your mayor will know that
you came and you fought.


1130
02:02:04.577 --> 02:02:08.327
When we get back to Spain,
I'm telling them what went on here.


1131
02:02:09.869 --> 02:02:13.327
And I hope they kick you
out of the Army.


1132
02:02:14.994 --> 02:02:17.202
If that happens,
you'll be doing me a favor.


1133
02:02:43.661 --> 02:02:44.952
Attention!

1134
02:02:46.036 --> 02:02:47.369
Forward march!

1135
02:02:48.411 --> 02:02:50.077
Route march!

1136

1140
02:05:00.077 --> 02:05:02.202

1143

1144

civil servants and deserters</i>


1146
