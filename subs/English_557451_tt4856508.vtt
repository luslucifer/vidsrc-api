No.

47
00:03:21.585 --> 00:03:22.585
Ugh.

48
00:03:31.751 --> 00:03:32.751
Ugh.

49
00:03:34.383 --> 00:03:35.383
Okay.

50
00:03:36.496 --> 00:03:38.163
I think it's passed.

51
00:03:39.056 --> 00:03:43.080
I am so sorry about
that restaurant choice.


52
00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.421
No, it's not like you could have known.

53
00:03:45.471 --> 00:03:46.970
I didn't see they failed
the health inspection


54
00:03:46.994 --> 00:03:48.416
until we were on the way out.

55
00:03:48.466 --> 00:03:49.912
I mean they really gotta
make those signs bigger


56
00:03:49.936 --> 00:03:53.179
or put a giant red X
on the door, something.


57
00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:54.534
Okay, it's fine.

58
00:03:54.584 --> 00:03:55.669
It's really like...

59
00:03:55.719 --> 00:03:59.469
The ice cream is sort
of settling my stomach.


60
00:04:07.111 --> 00:04:08.896
What are you doing?

61
00:04:08.946 --> 00:04:09.820
Kissing you.

62
00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.222
Why?

63
00:04:11.272 --> 00:04:12.846
We're on a date.

64
00:04:12.896 --> 00:04:15.563
It's the first and I feel ill.

65
00:04:17.233 --> 00:04:18.233
I'm sorry.

66
00:04:19.138 --> 00:04:20.138
Yeah.

67
00:04:20.834 --> 00:04:23.445
It's okay, just take it easy.

68
00:04:23.495 --> 00:04:27.111
Geez, you're a really
different sort of guy.


69
00:04:27.161 --> 00:04:28.832
Different.

70
00:04:28.882 --> 00:04:30.990
I can work with different.

71
00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.262
I should go.

72
00:04:32.312 --> 00:04:33.886
Oh, really.

73
00:04:33.936 --> 00:04:36.269
Was it the whole kiss thing?

74
00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:38.632
No.

75
00:04:38.682 --> 00:04:40.116
Maybe.

76
00:04:40.166 --> 00:04:41.600
Yes.

77
00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.392
I just really wanna go.

78
00:04:43.442 --> 00:04:44.442
Okay.

79
00:04:45.234 --> 00:04:48.350
So.

80
00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.168
Are you sick now too?

81
00:04:50.218 --> 00:04:51.680
Just right now?

82
00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:54.230
Oh, I should be so lucky.

83
00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.863
What do you mean?

84
00:04:57.483 --> 00:04:58.483
Cancer.

85
00:05:02.411 --> 00:05:03.411
Oh.

86
00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:06.472
Wow, I had no idea.

87
00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:10.790
Soon, I'll have none of this left.

88
00:05:11.945 --> 00:05:13.351
We were at lunch for two hours,

89
00:05:13.401 --> 00:05:14.401
I mean,

90
00:05:15.264 --> 00:05:17.103
why didn't you say anything?

91
00:05:17.153 --> 00:05:18.126
I don't wanna spend what little time

92
00:05:18.176 --> 00:05:21.843
I have left letting
myself be defined by it.


93
00:05:24.544 --> 00:05:26.127
You are so brave.

94
00:05:35.058 --> 00:05:37.813
Don't die, don't die, don't die,

95
00:05:37.863 --> 00:05:40.530
don't die, don't die, don't die!

96
00:05:45.138 --> 00:05:46.388
Okay, cheers.

97
00:05:47.225 --> 00:05:49.308
I broke my cold streak.

98
00:05:50.779 --> 00:05:52.708
Congratulations man,
I knew you could do it.


99
00:05:52.758 --> 00:05:53.758
Yeah.

100
00:05:56.226 --> 00:05:58.695
I want details, details.

101
00:05:58.745 --> 00:05:59.745
So I meet her online.

102
00:05:59.795 --> 00:06:01.694
And to start, it's not going great,

103
00:06:01.744 --> 00:06:02.527
but...

104
00:06:02.577 --> 00:06:04.855
But, my man turned it around right?

105
00:06:04.905 --> 00:06:06.129
- Exactly, exactly.
- Yes.


106
00:06:06.179 --> 00:06:07.921
Now she is not grooving it.

107
00:06:07.971 --> 00:06:10.064
But after I tell her I have cancer,

108
00:06:13.084 --> 00:06:14.084
in the bag.

109
00:06:16.767 --> 00:06:18.524
You have cancer?

110
00:06:18.574 --> 00:06:19.615
What, no!

111
00:06:19.665 --> 00:06:20.448
God no.

112
00:06:20.498 --> 00:06:23.531
Don't you think I
would of told you that?

113
00:06:23.581 --> 00:06:26.080
Why the hell did you
tell her you had it?


114
00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:28.447
Taylor, come on man, at this point,

115
00:06:28.497 --> 00:06:31.712
what else do I have going for me?

116
00:06:31.762 --> 00:06:34.928
Cancer is not something
you have going for you.


117
00:06:34.978 --> 00:06:37.045
Cancer is a bad thing okay.

118
00:06:37.095 --> 00:06:40.114
You don't joke about cancer man.

119
00:06:40.164 --> 00:06:41.414
Yes, yes, but

120
00:06:42.807 --> 00:06:44.854
do we blame people for their cancer

121
00:06:44.904 --> 00:06:49.071
or, or do we take pity on
them for having it, huh?


122
00:06:51.162 --> 00:06:52.829
Yes, now you get it.

123
00:06:54.018 --> 00:06:55.018
Okay.

124
00:06:55.687 --> 00:06:57.151
Let me get this straight.

125
00:06:57.201 --> 00:07:00.205
So you're at a
spot in your social life

126
00:07:00.255 --> 00:07:02.542
where you're actively
going online to meet girls,


127
00:07:02.592 --> 00:07:05.103
not to take on a normal date,

128
00:07:05.153 --> 00:07:08.855
but to trick them into a pity screw?

129
00:07:08.905 --> 00:07:10.155
Uh huh, yeah.

130
00:07:11.134 --> 00:07:13.741
And you see nothing
wrong with this whatsoever?


131
00:07:13.791 --> 00:07:15.183
It's not illegal.

132
00:07:15.233 --> 00:07:16.653
I didn't hurt the girl.

133
00:07:16.703 --> 00:07:18.249
Okay, but what about you?

134
00:07:18.299 --> 00:07:20.996
Don't you find it unhealthy for you?

135
00:07:21.046 --> 00:07:23.583
I think not scoring period,

136
00:07:23.633 --> 00:07:25.588
is even less healthy.

137
00:07:25.638 --> 00:07:27.197
Oh my god.

138
00:07:27.247 --> 00:07:30.725
I have clearly failed
in my duty to you

139
00:07:30.775 --> 00:07:32.500
on so many levels, I'm sorry.

140
00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:33.832
Taylor, come on man, don't mourn,

141
00:07:33.856 --> 00:07:35.624
you gotta be happy for me.

142
00:07:35.674 --> 00:07:37.682
I found my niche.

143
00:07:37.732 --> 00:07:40.104
Alright look, you were hands down

144
00:07:40.154 --> 00:07:41.726
the best storm captain.

145
00:07:41.776 --> 00:07:43.065
I remember frosh week

146
00:07:43.115 --> 00:07:45.444
practically crying because I didn't fit

147
00:07:45.494 --> 00:07:47.979
into any of those frat openers.

148
00:07:48.029 --> 00:07:49.186
Okay, and you just said...

149
00:07:49.236 --> 00:07:50.627
"This is not your scene man,

150
00:07:50.677 --> 00:07:52.617
"go find your niche."

151
00:07:52.667 --> 00:07:54.394
Fine okay, I did say that,

152
00:07:54.444 --> 00:07:57.503
but I said that to all the dorks.

153
00:07:57.553 --> 00:07:58.967
I'm sorry, but it's true.

154
00:07:59.017 --> 00:08:00.961
I say the same thing to
the new guys in sales.


155
00:08:01.011 --> 00:08:02.499
Yeah and you were right.

156
00:08:02.549 --> 00:08:06.587
Different approaches for different guys.

157
00:08:06.637 --> 00:08:08.656
This is not a niche okay.

158
00:08:08.706 --> 00:08:10.563
This is sick and weird.

159
00:08:10.613 --> 00:08:12.735
And besides, it's not sustainable.

160
00:08:12.785 --> 00:08:13.911
What do you mean?

161
00:08:13.961 --> 00:08:15.099
Well how do you expect to continue

162
00:08:15.123 --> 00:08:16.779
this relationship with this girl?

163
00:08:16.829 --> 00:08:18.306
Come on.

164
00:08:18.356 --> 00:08:21.023
There is no way
she doesn't see me again.

165
00:08:21.073 --> 00:08:23.375
You can't say no to cancer guy.

166
00:08:23.425 --> 00:08:24.802
She'd feel terrible.

167
00:08:24.852 --> 00:08:26.049
Okay, fine.

168
00:08:26.099 --> 00:08:27.796
She's gonna go on a couple
more dates with you,


169
00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:30.375
but eventually, she's gonna wanna know

170
00:08:30.425 --> 00:08:32.698
how your treatment is progressing.

171
00:08:32.748 --> 00:08:34.826
I tell her I'm in remission.

172
00:08:34.876 --> 00:08:35.659
Oh my god...

173
00:08:35.709 --> 00:08:37.189
At that point, she's stuck with me.

174
00:08:37.228 --> 00:08:38.228
I'm around.

175
00:08:39.117 --> 00:08:41.463
But she's gonna meet
your friends, your family.


176
00:08:41.513 --> 00:08:42.296
She's gonna meet me.

177
00:08:42.346 --> 00:08:44.499
I'm sure as hell not
going along with this lie.


178
00:08:44.549 --> 00:08:49.382
She is going to find out and
it's gonna be over like that.


179
00:08:50.709 --> 00:08:53.138
You are missing the whole point here.

180
00:08:53.188 --> 00:08:55.113
Okay, I am 29 years old.

181
00:08:55.163 --> 00:09:00.011
I have never been in a
relationship longer than six weeks.


182
00:09:00.061 --> 00:09:02.561
I have very modest goals here.

183
00:09:05.579 --> 00:09:08.746
Did you cut out
a part of your hair?

184
00:09:11.417 --> 00:09:12.417
Really?

185
00:09:13.165 --> 00:09:14.165
Really?

186
00:09:21.397 --> 00:09:22.397
Awe shit.

187
00:09:23.301 --> 00:09:24.259
What is it?

188
00:09:24.309 --> 00:09:27.899
"John, you're about to
have the battle of your life.


189
00:09:27.949 --> 00:09:29.647
"My cousin died from cancer last year

190
00:09:29.697 --> 00:09:32.311
"and it tore me apart.

191
00:09:32.361 --> 00:09:35.848
"I'm so sorry, but I can't
be a part of your journey.


192
00:09:35.898 --> 00:09:38.498
"I can't do that to myself again.

193
00:09:38.548 --> 00:09:41.787
"I feel so terrible but
that's the way it is.


194
00:09:41.837 --> 00:09:44.699
"Wishing you good health, Amy."

195
00:09:44.749 --> 00:09:45.749
You see?

196
00:09:46.641 --> 00:09:48.746
Shit man, I thought,

197
00:09:48.796 --> 00:09:51.083
I thought women liked broken guys?

198
00:09:51.133 --> 00:09:52.861
They do, but it has

199
00:09:52.911 --> 00:09:55.381
to be a guy
that they can actually fix.

200
00:09:55.431 --> 00:09:56.781
Unless this girl's an oncologist,

201
00:09:56.831 --> 00:09:58.923
that's just not gonna fly.

202
00:09:58.973 --> 00:10:00.815
I guess you're right.

203
00:10:00.865 --> 00:10:03.265
That's not gonna work.

204
00:10:03.315 --> 00:10:05.602
Alright, let's just recap here.

205
00:10:05.652 --> 00:10:06.867
I mean it's what?

206
00:10:06.917 --> 00:10:08.667
10 years beyond frosh

207
00:10:09.964 --> 00:10:12.195
and you are still at the same spot

208
00:10:12.245 --> 00:10:14.170
that you started in man.

209
00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:15.723
It's not that bad okay,

210
00:10:15.773 --> 00:10:17.279
I have made strides.

211
00:10:17.329 --> 00:10:20.135
I've been with five girls since then.

212
00:10:20.185 --> 00:10:22.443
Well, three for real

213
00:10:22.493 --> 00:10:24.910
and two were just in and out.

214
00:10:27.253 --> 00:10:30.242
What do you mean just in and out?

215
00:10:30.292 --> 00:10:34.805
That's what you do, you go
in and out a bunch of times.


216
00:10:34.855 --> 00:10:35.638
Right, yeah, no.

217
00:10:35.688 --> 00:10:37.171
It just wasn't a bunch of times.

218
00:10:37.221 --> 00:10:39.471
It was more kind of like in

219
00:10:41.283 --> 00:10:42.366
and then out.

220
00:10:44.837 --> 00:10:48.763
So it was just in
one time and then out?

221
00:10:48.813 --> 00:10:53.813
It wasn't like in out, in
out, in out, in out, in out?


222
00:10:53.868 --> 00:10:55.035
Pretty much.

223
00:10:57.145 --> 00:10:57.928
What did you do?

224
00:10:57.978 --> 00:10:59.498
Did you go in
and then get freaked out

225
00:10:59.524 --> 00:11:02.625
and start crying and
run away or something?


226
00:11:02.675 --> 00:11:03.842
Pretty much.

227
00:11:06.565 --> 00:11:10.577
Alright, this is not, this is not good.

228
00:11:10.627 --> 00:11:13.810
Okay, here's what you're gonna do okay?

229
00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:16.917
You are going to set a goal.

230
00:11:16.967 --> 00:11:18.682
You, look at me.

231
00:11:18.732 --> 00:11:21.149
You're gonna visualize a path

232
00:11:22.021 --> 00:11:23.244
and then you need
to get on that path

233
00:11:23.268 --> 00:11:26.171
and you need to stay on that path.

234
00:11:26.221 --> 00:11:27.698
Okay?

235
00:11:27.748 --> 00:11:29.169
Okay.

236
00:11:29.219 --> 00:11:31.535
Yeah, well I guess,

237
00:11:31.585 --> 00:11:34.082
I guess I just really want a girlfriend

238
00:11:34.132 --> 00:11:35.538
before I turn 30.

239
00:11:35.588 --> 00:11:36.897
Okay great, great.

240
00:11:36.947 --> 00:11:39.249
Because you can't have the wife and kids

241
00:11:39.299 --> 00:11:40.306
unless you start there, right?

242
00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:42.131
So, you're on the path.

243
00:11:42.181 --> 00:11:44.371
Yeah, yeah, it's like
those movies where the guy,


244
00:11:44.421 --> 00:11:46.541
he wants to lose his
virginity before the prom,


245
00:11:46.591 --> 00:11:50.341
except this, this is
the more mature version.


246
00:11:51.365 --> 00:11:54.887
Yeah, yeah, it's the
more mature version.


247
00:11:54.937 --> 00:11:55.720
Yeah.

248
00:11:55.770 --> 00:11:57.882
See the problem for me,
the real problem is,


249
00:11:57.932 --> 00:12:01.103
I want the girl,
the girl don't want me.

250
00:12:01.153 --> 00:12:02.291
Everything else in my love life

251
00:12:02.315 --> 00:12:04.505
is actually pretty great except

252
00:12:04.555 --> 00:12:06.927
that last little piece, I just,

253
00:12:06.977 --> 00:12:08.563
I can't get over that hurdle.

254
00:12:08.613 --> 00:12:10.833
You're at a point in
life where people are,


255
00:12:10.883 --> 00:12:13.562
they're very established in who they are.

256
00:12:13.612 --> 00:12:15.551
And once they know that,

257
00:12:15.601 --> 00:12:18.617
hey, they're on their path.

258
00:12:18.667 --> 00:12:21.917
So you gotta ask yourself one question,

259
00:12:22.879 --> 00:12:23.879
who are you?

260
00:12:26.772 --> 00:12:27.772
Who am I?

261
00:12:30.901 --> 00:12:32.651
Well, my name's John.

262
00:12:34.193 --> 00:12:35.753
Sure.

263
00:12:35.803 --> 00:12:37.754
And I want a girlfriend.

264
00:13:01.647 --> 00:13:02.911
Pst, pst, pst.

265
00:13:02.961 --> 00:13:05.980
Hey, go check out that guy
standing around the corner.


266
00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:07.660
Go check out a guy?

267
00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:09.228
You know what I'm saying.

268
00:13:09.278 --> 00:13:11.611
Go check out what he's flipping through.

269
00:13:11.661 --> 00:13:12.661
Go.

270
00:13:20.408 --> 00:13:21.785
1984.

271
00:13:21.835 --> 00:13:23.707
He's thinking of buying George Orwell.

272
00:13:23.757 --> 00:13:25.973
Yeah Richard, I know,
I helped him find it.


273
00:13:26.023 --> 00:13:27.847
Doesn't it drive you crazy?

274
00:13:27.897 --> 00:13:30.158
John, what the hell
are you talking about?


275
00:13:30.208 --> 00:13:31.028
Alright, look.

276
00:13:31.078 --> 00:13:32.749
How often does this happen?

277
00:13:32.799 --> 00:13:35.168
A dude like that dressed in
his fancy business clothes


278
00:13:35.218 --> 00:13:38.051
walks in here to buy
a book we all read

279
00:13:38.101 --> 00:13:39.271
like way back in the day.

280
00:13:39.321 --> 00:13:42.587
Did he seriously not go to high school?

281
00:13:42.637 --> 00:13:44.229
That should be on one of those lists.

282
00:13:44.279 --> 00:13:46.312
You know, on the internet.

283
00:13:46.362 --> 00:13:48.135
What lists?

284
00:13:48.185 --> 00:13:49.433
You know, like those blogs.

285
00:13:49.483 --> 00:13:51.141
Top 20 Things Asian Parents Do That Only

286
00:13:51.191 --> 00:13:52.933
Asian Millennials Would Get.

287
00:13:52.983 --> 00:13:53.766
Something like that.

288
00:13:53.816 --> 00:13:56.965
Things that really annoy bookstore staff.

289
00:13:57.015 --> 00:13:59.879
I know those lists, but
that doesn't annoy me.


290
00:13:59.929 --> 00:14:02.582
The guy wants a book,
this is a book store.


291
00:14:02.632 --> 00:14:05.323
Oh come on Richard, don't
leave me hanging here.


292
00:14:05.373 --> 00:14:08.417
It is crystal clear that
he was some dumb meathead


293
00:14:08.467 --> 00:14:11.287
who spent all of school getting
drunk and playing football.


294
00:14:11.337 --> 00:14:15.335
And then his daddy gave
him a position at the firm.


295
00:14:15.385 --> 00:14:16.545
Okay, so now all of a sudden,

296
00:14:16.587 --> 00:14:18.469
he waltzes in here and says,

297
00:14:18.519 --> 00:14:21.002
"Gee, I wanna read smart people books."

298
00:14:21.052 --> 00:14:23.903
So he reads 1984, maybe
Catcher In The Rye.


299
00:14:23.953 --> 00:14:25.522
And then he goes to the parties

300
00:14:25.572 --> 00:14:26.469
and he's talking to all these people

301
00:14:26.519 --> 00:14:28.034
like he's the only one on planet earth

302
00:14:28.058 --> 00:14:29.800
that's actually read the book,

303
00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:31.229
and he thinks he's saying these profound

304
00:14:31.253 --> 00:14:32.730
things about it and society.

305
00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:35.197
Meanwhile, meanwhile Richard,

306
00:14:36.644 --> 00:14:39.058
we were all there 10 years ago

307
00:14:39.108 --> 00:14:40.259
but we've gotten over it.

308
00:14:40.309 --> 00:14:41.772
But see, of course you
can't say anything to him,


309
00:14:41.796 --> 00:14:44.527
you just gotta let him go on.

310
00:14:44.577 --> 00:14:46.980
I think you're being
too hard on the guy John.


311
00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:48.227
What are you talking about?

312
00:14:48.277 --> 00:14:49.060
This is what we do.

313
00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:51.654
We analyze people's book choices.

314
00:14:51.704 --> 00:14:52.789
Okay.

315
00:14:52.839 --> 00:14:53.868
Here's my take.

316
00:14:53.918 --> 00:14:55.869
If you're right, which you may not be.

317
00:14:55.919 --> 00:14:57.762
Because he could be rereading it.

318
00:14:57.812 --> 00:15:00.058
He could be buying a copy
for his younger brother,


319
00:15:00.108 --> 00:15:02.970
but if you're right, what's the big deal?

320
00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:05.475
Maybe he realizes he's
missed out on some classics


321
00:15:05.525 --> 00:15:07.058
and now that he has his act together

322
00:15:07.108 --> 00:15:09.018
he wants to spend his time this way.

323
00:15:09.068 --> 00:15:10.735
I don't think most people
would mock him for that.


324
00:15:10.759 --> 00:15:12.348
I think they'd respect it.

325
00:15:12.398 --> 00:15:15.387
You think that guy has his act together?

326
00:15:15.437 --> 00:15:16.227
Yeah.

327
00:15:16.277 --> 00:15:17.780
I mean look at him.

328
00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:21.247
He seems confident, he seems established.

329
00:15:22.239 --> 00:15:24.850
Established, you see
that's what I gotta be.


330
00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:28.279
Not me man, I'm staying off the grid.

331
00:15:28.329 --> 00:15:29.984
Look at all these guys
passing by out there.


332
00:15:30.008 --> 00:15:32.031
Same age as me, same background.

333
00:15:32.081 --> 00:15:33.808
But they all work at their firms making

334
00:15:33.858 --> 00:15:35.208
like 70 grand a year doing things

335
00:15:35.258 --> 00:15:36.635
people do in ordinary life that

336
00:15:36.685 --> 00:15:38.725
I don't even know about.

337
00:15:38.775 --> 00:15:41.805
Richard, how did all
these guys suddenly just,


338
00:15:41.855 --> 00:15:43.735
get it together?

339
00:15:43.785 --> 00:15:46.323
It's the women that do it for them.

340
00:15:46.373 --> 00:15:47.797
They domesticate the man.

341
00:15:47.847 --> 00:15:49.981
The man rises to the woman's standard.

342
00:15:50.031 --> 00:15:51.127
You go to a single guys house,

343
00:15:51.151 --> 00:15:53.535
piss all around the floor near the toilet.

344
00:15:53.585 --> 00:15:55.189
Guy with a girlfriend, no piss.

345
00:15:55.239 --> 00:15:56.022
Why?

346
00:15:56.072 --> 00:15:58.041
Because she either makes
him clean it up every time,


347
00:15:58.065 --> 00:16:00.043
or he pees sitting down.

348
00:16:00.093 --> 00:16:02.789
Yeah, heard about those guys.

349
00:16:02.839 --> 00:16:04.470
So if you wanna be an established guy

350
00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:07.845
you have got to first get
with an established woman.


351
00:16:07.895 --> 00:16:09.790
Yeah, but I don't think women like guys

352
00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:11.303
that far beneath them.

353
00:16:11.353 --> 00:16:12.224
And that's the paradox.

354
00:16:12.274 --> 00:16:14.535
You can't get established
without an established girl.


355
00:16:14.585 --> 00:16:15.752
But the established girl will only

356
00:16:15.776 --> 00:16:17.880
go out with an established guy.

357
00:16:17.930 --> 00:16:20.583
So you have to trick the girl

358
00:16:20.633 --> 00:16:22.611
into believing you're established.

359
00:16:22.661 --> 00:16:23.661

No I'm good thanks.

378
00:18:12.542 --> 00:18:14.625
What do you have there?

379
00:18:18.758 --> 00:18:19.758
1984.

380
00:18:22.185 --> 00:18:23.759
Great choice.

381
00:18:23.809 --> 00:18:25.559
You're gonna love it.

382
00:18:27.367 --> 00:18:28.150
Really?

383
00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:31.726
I'm actually a little bit
embarrassed to be buying it.


384
00:18:31.776 --> 00:18:32.876
Why?

385
00:18:32.926 --> 00:18:34.119
Well I just feel like most people read

386
00:18:34.143 --> 00:18:35.811
this back in high school.

387
00:18:35.861 --> 00:18:36.990
They're gonna see me with
it and think I wasn't


388
00:18:37.014 --> 00:18:41.261
paying attention for like 10
years or something like that.


389
00:18:41.311 --> 00:18:43.124
No, no, no, no they won't.

390
00:18:43.174 --> 00:18:44.494
Actually, you know, to be honest,

391
00:18:44.527 --> 00:18:45.853
I think they'll respect you for brushing

392
00:18:45.877 --> 00:18:47.331
up on your classics.

393
00:18:47.381 --> 00:18:50.023
It's a real sign of self-confidence.

394
00:18:50.073 --> 00:18:50.949
Really?

395
00:18:50.999 --> 00:18:52.890
Well, I mean I can't speak for everyone,

396
00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:56.273
but I find it a very attractive quality.

397
00:18:57.831 --> 00:18:59.364
Do you actually feel that way?

398
00:18:59.414 --> 00:19:00.414
Sure.

399
00:19:01.344 --> 00:19:02.344
Wow.

400
00:19:04.509 --> 00:19:07.006
I feel kind of relieved.

401
00:19:07.056 --> 00:19:11.246
I don't know why, but
that means a lot to me.


402
00:19:11.296 --> 00:19:14.708
Well I've never seen you in here before.

403
00:19:14.758 --> 00:19:16.709
My name's John.

404
00:19:16.759 --> 00:19:19.813
Just moved from BC, Vanessa.

405
00:19:19.863 --> 00:19:21.775
Nice to meet you.

406
00:19:21.825 --> 00:19:24.825
Maybe you'd like to go out Saturday.

407
00:19:28.791 --> 00:19:29.813
Sure.

408
00:19:29.863 --> 00:19:32.054
I'm so sorry, I know
that was very abrupt.


409
00:19:32.104 --> 00:19:35.481
I just, well, I felt
like I had to ask.

410
00:19:35.531 --> 00:19:37.195
It's okay.

411
00:19:37.245 --> 00:19:38.692
Here.

412
00:19:38.742 --> 00:19:41.013
Just put your number in my phone.

413
00:19:41.063 --> 00:19:42.063
Great.

414
00:19:42.853 --> 00:19:43.853
Yeah.

415
00:19:46.175 --> 00:19:49.918
Well listen, well I'm really
looking forward to Saturday.


416
00:19:49.968 --> 00:19:51.516
Nice to meet you Vanessa.

417
00:19:51.566 --> 00:19:52.566
You too.

418
00:19:53.399 --> 00:19:54.649
Enjoy Orwell.

419
00:19:57.584 --> 00:19:59.259
That was not supposed to happen was it?

420
00:19:59.309 --> 00:20:00.092
That was a fluke.

421
00:20:00.142 --> 00:20:02.951
The God of Eros
was asleep at the wheel.

422
00:20:03.001 --> 00:20:05.168
What are you gonna do now?

423
00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:10.677
Not screw things up for a change.

424
00:20:17.351 --> 00:20:18.965
Okay.

425
00:20:19.015 --> 00:20:20.015
Okay yeah.

426
00:20:22.448 --> 00:20:25.437
Just remember, if you start
to lose control, just stop,


427
00:20:25.487 --> 00:20:28.991
count to three, regain your composure.

428
00:20:29.041 --> 00:20:30.708
You can't lose this.

429
00:20:31.606 --> 00:20:32.717
Let's go!

430
00:20:46.904 --> 00:20:50.214
Well okay, let's just
say he's not my usual type,


431
00:20:50.264 --> 00:20:54.022
but I thought, what the heck you know?

432
00:20:54.072 --> 00:20:56.405
I might as well mix
things up for a change.


433
00:21:01.103 --> 00:21:02.733
I gotta go.

434
00:21:02.783 --> 00:21:03.783
I gotta go.

435
00:21:05.607 --> 00:21:07.213
Vanessa, hi.

436
00:21:07.263 --> 00:21:08.263
Wow, you,

437
00:21:10.623 --> 00:21:12.660
you look wonderful.

438
00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:13.493
How are you?

439
00:21:13.543 --> 00:21:15.023
I'm great.

440
00:21:15.073 --> 00:21:16.073
How are you?

441
00:21:18.719 --> 00:21:20.694
I'm on top of the world.

442
00:21:25.196 --> 00:21:25.979
Exactly.

443
00:21:26.029 --> 00:21:27.075
That's pretty funny.

444
00:21:27.125 --> 00:21:28.708
Yeah, I don't know.

445
00:21:30.724 --> 00:21:31.724
Wow.

446
00:21:31.769 --> 00:21:32.552
So let me get this straight,

447
00:21:32.602 --> 00:21:34.904
you picked up everything and just moved

448
00:21:34.954 --> 00:21:36.360
to Toronto, just like that?

449
00:21:36.410 --> 00:21:37.515
Well I didn't come here blind.

450
00:21:37.539 --> 00:21:38.834
I had the job offer at the bank

451
00:21:38.884 --> 00:21:43.106
and the terms are great, so,
I'm a senior analyst now.


452
00:21:43.156 --> 00:21:47.235
Wow, and what exactly
does an analyst do?


453
00:21:47.285 --> 00:21:49.419
It's really beautiful in Vancouver.

454
00:21:49.469 --> 00:21:52.162
But I was just
getting so bored you know?

455
00:21:52.212 --> 00:21:53.113
There was nothing happening there

456
00:21:53.163 --> 00:21:55.579
so I came here for some adventure.

457
00:21:55.629 --> 00:21:58.603
Well I'm sure they had
a copy of 1984 in BC.


458
00:21:58.653 --> 00:22:01.004
You probably didn't have to
come all this way for that.


459
00:22:01.054 --> 00:22:02.273
Yeah.

460
00:22:02.323 --> 00:22:05.704
But seriously, I really
admire your bravery.


461
00:22:05.754 --> 00:22:07.593
Oh no, no, I'm not brave.

462
00:22:07.643 --> 00:22:09.679
Once I got here I realized
I don't know anyone,


463
00:22:09.729 --> 00:22:11.582
I don't know anything.

464
00:22:11.632 --> 00:22:13.279
Last thing I feel is brave.

465
00:22:13.329 --> 00:22:15.317
No but that's I guess what
I'm talking about alright.


466
00:22:15.341 --> 00:22:17.449
Like not anybody can just jump

467
00:22:17.499 --> 00:22:19.749
into the unknown like that.

468
00:22:20.775 --> 00:22:23.608
So tell me, what
did you do in BC?

469
00:22:25.272 --> 00:22:28.078
Listen, you are so
sweet to listen to me

470
00:22:28.128 --> 00:22:29.907
talk about myself for so long,

471
00:22:29.957 --> 00:22:32.040
but let's talk about you.

472
00:22:33.097 --> 00:22:34.097
Okay.

473
00:22:34.941 --> 00:22:36.209
What do you wanna know?

474
00:22:36.259 --> 00:22:38.366
I don't know, everything.

475
00:22:39.552 --> 00:22:41.079
Where do you see yourself in three years,

476
00:22:41.103 --> 00:22:43.027
what are your career goals, you know?

477
00:22:43.077 --> 00:22:44.023
To be honest, I'm just taking it

478
00:22:44.073 --> 00:22:45.998
the way life throws it to me.

479
00:22:46.048 --> 00:22:50.517
And how is it throwing
it to you right now?


480
00:22:50.567 --> 00:22:53.150
Pretty relaxed, pretty chill.

481
00:22:54.249 --> 00:22:57.166
That's the way I like it now, so...

482
00:23:00.997 --> 00:23:02.529
Maybe I should chill out more too.

483
00:23:02.579 --> 00:23:04.403
You know, my brothers
always telling me that.


484
00:23:04.453 --> 00:23:07.838
Nigel's like, "You just need
to be in the zone more."


485
00:23:07.888 --> 00:23:10.607
And if I was more
zen I would probably be

486
00:23:10.657 --> 00:23:12.654
like less impulsive.

487
00:23:12.704 --> 00:23:14.558
Yeah, he's really into zen meditation.

488
00:23:14.608 --> 00:23:16.824
He says it's really good for his work.

489
00:23:16.874 --> 00:23:18.799
And what does he do?

490
00:23:18.849 --> 00:23:20.475
He's a consultant.

491
00:23:20.525 --> 00:23:22.663
And what does he consult in?

492
00:23:22.713 --> 00:23:23.963
Nigel is like

493
00:23:25.329 --> 00:23:27.718
my favorite person in the world.

494
00:23:27.768 --> 00:23:30.518
He's done so well for himself.

495
00:23:30.568 --> 00:23:31.944
He has more money rolling in than

496
00:23:31.994 --> 00:23:33.303
he knows what to do with.

497
00:23:33.353 --> 00:23:34.136
Wow.

498
00:23:34.186 --> 00:23:35.991
Yeah, he's just got that magic touch.

499
00:23:36.041 --> 00:23:38.440
And he's probably right,
if I was more zen

500
00:23:38.490 --> 00:23:40.135
I'd be less impulsive.

501
00:23:40.185 --> 00:23:43.006
You know, I'm not even
sure what consultant means.


502
00:23:43.056 --> 00:23:46.302
To be honest, I did something
really big the other week,


503
00:23:46.352 --> 00:23:49.185
and god I'm kind of regretting it.

504
00:23:50.194 --> 00:23:52.061
Okay, you gotta tell me.

505
00:23:52.111 --> 00:23:53.362
Okay.

506
00:23:53.412 --> 00:23:56.920
Well, so one of
my only friends in town

507
00:23:56.970 --> 00:23:59.115
was looking for a
place same time as me.

508
00:23:59.165 --> 00:24:00.235
And we both went to see this place

509
00:24:00.259 --> 00:24:01.579
that we both really liked.

510
00:24:01.629 --> 00:24:04.046
And so, we went halves on it.

511
00:24:05.396 --> 00:24:07.063
Big decision, wow.

512
00:24:08.756 --> 00:24:10.568
Lots of potential fallout.

513
00:24:10.618 --> 00:24:13.216
Exactly, I'm kind of
horrified by what I did.


514
00:24:13.266 --> 00:24:14.556
Yeah, but same thing happened to me

515
00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:15.691
a couple of years ago.

516
00:24:15.741 --> 00:24:16.524
Really?

517
00:24:16.574 --> 00:24:18.337
Yeah, yeah, a buddy and I rented this

518
00:24:18.387 --> 00:24:20.507
tiny tiny place together.

519
00:24:20.557 --> 00:24:23.251
We threw up a curtain, divided it.

520
00:24:23.301 --> 00:24:25.072
Sometimes the curtain would fall down.

521
00:24:25.122 --> 00:24:27.481
One night he comes home
completely unexpected


522
00:24:27.531 --> 00:24:30.114
and well, there I am, you know.

523
00:24:33.844 --> 00:24:35.056
Jerking off.

524
00:24:35.106 --> 00:24:36.523
Yeah, I got it.

525
00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:41.060
So, not always the
best living arrangement.


526
00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:42.110
Clearly.

527
00:24:43.014 --> 00:24:44.597
Good point, yeah.

528
00:24:46.542 --> 00:24:48.660
My situations a little
bit different though.


529
00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:50.426
You got one of those stand up dividers,

530
00:24:50.476 --> 00:24:51.542
stretches out like an accordion?

531
00:24:51.566 --> 00:24:54.866
You know, those are smart
'cause those stay up.


532
00:24:54.916 --> 00:24:58.995
No, it's just that it's a two bedroom.

533
00:24:59.045 --> 00:25:01.306
When I said that we were splitting it,

534
00:25:01.356 --> 00:25:04.778
I meant that we bought a condo together.

535
00:25:04.828 --> 00:25:07.667
Oh wow, you bought a place?

536
00:25:07.717 --> 00:25:08.990
Yeah.

537
00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:09.946
That's big.

538
00:25:09.996 --> 00:25:10.996
That's huge.

539
00:25:12.570 --> 00:25:14.523
Congratulations.

540
00:25:14.573 --> 00:25:15.744
Thanks.

541
00:25:15.794 --> 00:25:19.063
We might not get the
financing so who knows.


542
00:25:19.113 --> 00:25:20.728
Well I'm glad it's a two bedroom

543
00:25:20.778 --> 00:25:22.348
'cause I actually still have that curtain

544
00:25:22.372 --> 00:25:24.674
and I was wondering if it
was right to lend it to you.


545
00:25:24.724 --> 00:25:26.802
It still has a stain.

546
00:25:26.852 --> 00:25:27.635
Yeah.

547
00:25:27.685 --> 00:25:28.468
I would have passed.

548
00:25:28.518 --> 00:25:30.426
That's a good call.

549
00:25:44.018 --> 00:25:45.518
One, two, three.

550
00:25:47.499 --> 00:25:48.952
What are you doing?

551
00:25:49.002 --> 00:25:51.762
Sorry, I didn't mean to talk out loud.

552
00:25:51.812 --> 00:25:52.812
I'm just

553
00:25:55.315 --> 00:25:58.482
remembering that I have to take these.

554
00:26:01.949 --> 00:26:03.199
My three pills.

555
00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:05.929
Are you sick or?

556
00:26:05.979 --> 00:26:07.979
No, no, I have cancer.

557
00:26:12.611 --> 00:26:13.394
What?

558
00:26:13.444 --> 00:26:17.595
No, no, these are to prevent the cancer.

559
00:26:17.645 --> 00:26:20.985
There's pills to prevent cancer?

560
00:26:21.035 --> 00:26:23.124
They're multivitamins.

561
00:26:23.174 --> 00:26:25.030
With a prescription label on them?

562
00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:26.163
Very multi.

563
00:26:30.973 --> 00:26:31.973
Okay.

564
00:26:54.691 --> 00:26:56.387
What's going on here?

565
00:26:56.437 --> 00:26:58.488
It was just a kiss.

566
00:26:58.538 --> 00:27:02.634
Nothing really, I just I
thought, you know, a kiss.


567
00:27:02.684 --> 00:27:03.684
Okay.

568
00:27:04.491 --> 00:27:05.274
Too soon.

569
00:27:05.324 --> 00:27:06.580
Yeah, you think?

570
00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:08.204
Do you even have the pills down yet?

571
00:27:08.254 --> 00:27:10.922
At least two of them.

572
00:27:10.972 --> 00:27:13.888
Okay, I think I'm gonna go.

573
00:27:13.938 --> 00:27:16.826
No please, look, 
I can salvage this.

574
00:27:16.876 --> 00:27:18.293
God I'm so sorry.

575
00:27:19.316 --> 00:27:20.147
Things were going well.

576
00:27:20.197 --> 00:27:22.122
Yeah, yeah they were.

577
00:27:22.172 --> 00:27:24.851
I've had a really rough day,

578
00:27:24.901 --> 00:27:26.363
and I know I'm
acting like a total weirdo

579
00:27:26.387 --> 00:27:29.054
and I do, I sincerely apologize.

580
00:27:30.109 --> 00:27:32.787
Okay, it's okay, I understand.

581
00:27:32.837 --> 00:27:35.394
Great, great, so let me take
you out next week some time


582
00:27:35.444 --> 00:27:37.171
and I can totally
make it up to you.

583
00:27:37.221 --> 00:27:38.221
Look John,

584
00:27:41.382 --> 00:27:42.700
I really like talking with you,

585
00:27:42.750 --> 00:27:46.417
but I don't think we
can continue with this.


586
00:27:48.854 --> 00:27:50.331
There was a this?

587
00:27:50.381 --> 00:27:51.381
No, no.

588
00:27:52.553 --> 00:27:54.516
Look, you're a really nice guy,

589
00:27:54.566 --> 00:27:57.835
we're in two completely
different places right now.


590
00:27:57.885 --> 00:27:58.828
I don't know about that.

591
00:27:58.878 --> 00:28:00.958
I mean Bathurst really isn't
that far from Defferin...


592
00:28:01.006 --> 00:28:02.756
In our lives, John.

593
00:28:04.534 --> 00:28:07.650
You know, I really like talking with you.

594
00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:09.188
You're a really nice guy.

595
00:28:09.238 --> 00:28:12.548
You were really nice to
me at the book store.


596
00:28:12.598 --> 00:28:14.822
Listen, if you wanna meet up as friends,

597
00:28:14.872 --> 00:28:16.644
totally down for hanging out again.

598
00:28:16.694 --> 00:28:17.973
Okay, yeah.

599
00:28:18.023 --> 00:28:19.892
No, no, for sure.

600
00:28:19.942 --> 00:28:22.916
So yeah, I guess just call me

601
00:28:22.966 --> 00:28:25.716
the next time you wanna hang out.

602
00:28:28.648 --> 00:28:29.942
Hey, I covered this okay.

603
00:28:29.992 --> 00:28:31.006
Okay great.

604
00:28:31.056 --> 00:28:32.532
You know what, let's just leave it

605
00:28:32.582 --> 00:28:34.116
at the botched make-out.

606
00:28:34.166 --> 00:28:36.341
I think you've had enough for one night.

607
00:28:36.391 --> 00:28:37.995
Fair.

608
00:28:38.045 --> 00:28:39.795
Bye John.

609
00:28:47.408 --> 00:28:48.408
Idiot.

610
00:29:26.747 --> 00:29:27.914
God you idiot!

611
00:29:38.694 --> 00:29:40.027
One, two, three!

612
00:29:57.917 --> 00:29:59.043
Hello.

613
00:29:59.093 --> 00:30:02.851
Amy, Amy hey, it's John
from the other night.


614
00:30:02.901 --> 00:30:03.901
Oh, hi.

615
00:30:04.943 --> 00:30:06.864
Listen, I want you
to know I got your text


616
00:30:06.914 --> 00:30:09.724
and I completely understood.

617
00:30:09.774 --> 00:30:12.748
But I wanted to call
and tell you something.


618
00:30:12.798 --> 00:30:14.121
What is it?

619
00:30:14.171 --> 00:30:15.577
I have amazing news.

620
00:30:15.627 --> 00:30:17.030
I just heard back from my specialist

621
00:30:17.054 --> 00:30:19.721
and I don't have cancer anymore.

622
00:30:21.157 --> 00:30:22.981
Wow, that is amazing news.

623
00:30:23.031 --> 00:30:23.814
Isn't it?

624
00:30:23.864 --> 00:30:26.875
I mean I have
a new lease on life.

625
00:30:26.925 --> 00:30:28.917
I'm so happy for you.

626
00:30:28.967 --> 00:30:31.071
So, what do ya say?

627
00:30:31.121 --> 00:30:32.669
About what?

628
00:30:32.719 --> 00:30:34.069
Well I mean being with me will now

629
00:30:34.093 --> 00:30:36.869
be a heartache free experience.

630
00:30:36.919 --> 00:30:38.883
So do you want
to get together again soon?

631
00:30:38.933 --> 00:30:39.949
Maybe give it another go?

632
00:30:39.999 --> 00:30:42.626
I mean you and
I, we had great energy

633
00:30:42.676 --> 00:30:45.009
if you know what I'm saying.

634
00:30:45.979 --> 00:30:48.618
So you don't have any cancer at all?

635
00:30:48.668 --> 00:30:49.805
Exactly.

636
00:30:49.855 --> 00:30:50.801
Everything is fine?

637
00:30:50.851 --> 00:30:52.482
Yeah, I have perfect health.

638
00:30:52.532 --> 00:30:54.020
Not a problem in the world.

639
00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:56.635
Yeah, to be honest, I'm
really not that interested.


640
00:30:56.685 --> 00:30:58.518
You were pretty weird.

641
00:30:59.483 --> 00:31:00.266
Wait, what?

642
00:31:00.316 --> 00:31:02.307
No, no, no, your text gave
me the impression that...


643
00:31:02.331 --> 00:31:03.779
That was pity.

644
00:31:03.829 --> 00:31:05.473
I'm really glad you're feeling better

645
00:31:05.523 --> 00:31:07.940
but I'm super busy, gotta go.

646
00:31:17.661 --> 00:31:19.744
Stupid freaking cancer!

647
00:31:26.311 --> 00:31:27.620
Get lost asshole!

648
00:31:27.670 --> 00:31:31.753
Yeah, we're
trying to make-out here!


649
00:31:36.514 --> 00:31:38.299
This is my day.

650
00:31:38.349 --> 00:31:40.963
What do you think of this?

651
00:31:41.013 --> 00:31:43.607
"Calling all grade five and six girls.

652
00:31:43.657 --> 00:31:46.212
"Do you have what it takes
to tell it like it is?


653
00:31:46.262 --> 00:31:48.997
"Sign up for the public
speaking contest in the office.


654
00:31:49.047 --> 00:31:52.738
"Winners get certificates to Laser Quest."

655
00:31:52.788 --> 00:31:54.923
Girls like Laser Quest right?

656
00:31:54.973 --> 00:31:57.946
I think I can confidently
say I don't know.


657
00:31:57.996 --> 00:31:59.961
And I don't care.

658
00:32:00.011 --> 00:32:02.321
Oh man, you have no idea how stressful

659
00:32:02.371 --> 00:32:04.091
organizing this stuff is.

660
00:32:04.141 --> 00:32:05.141
Try me.

661
00:32:06.086 --> 00:32:09.030
Okay John, being on the
Parent Teacher Association


662
00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:11.439
not only opens you up to
all kinds of criticism,


663
00:32:11.489 --> 00:32:14.843
other parents and teachers,
but it also changes


664
00:32:14.893 --> 00:32:17.153
they way they view your child.

665
00:32:17.203 --> 00:32:19.113
Which creates a very difficult situation

666
00:32:19.163 --> 00:32:20.859
for everyone involved.

667
00:32:20.909 --> 00:32:22.817
Then don't do it.

668
00:32:22.867 --> 00:32:25.468
Wait, why are you organizing
a public speaking contest?


669
00:32:25.518 --> 00:32:29.795
Because Maria wants us to
get in on the ground floor.


670
00:32:29.845 --> 00:32:33.379
I don't know, she calls it
activist parenting or something.


671
00:32:33.429 --> 00:32:35.297
Yeah it's creepy.

672
00:32:35.347 --> 00:32:36.923
Your kids in junior kindergarten

673
00:32:36.973 --> 00:32:39.834
and you're flouncing around
with grade five girls?


674
00:32:39.884 --> 00:32:40.667
I'm not flouncing.

675
00:32:40.717 --> 00:32:42.227
Look, you don't have kids okay?

676
00:32:42.277 --> 00:32:43.067
You don't even know what it's like.

677
00:32:43.117 --> 00:32:45.251
Yeah I don't even have
a girlfriend, thank you.


678
00:32:45.301 --> 00:32:46.610
I'm sorry.

679
00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:47.838
Sorry it didn't work out with Vanessa

680
00:32:47.862 --> 00:32:49.268
but you know, it kinda sounds like...

681
00:32:49.292 --> 00:32:50.075
Like I blew it?

682
00:32:50.125 --> 00:32:51.687
Yeah, like you blew it.

683
00:32:51.737 --> 00:32:54.334
But it's okay, there'll be others.

684
00:32:54.384 --> 00:32:57.821
Well I'm actually seeing
her again this weekend.


685
00:32:57.871 --> 00:32:58.829
We're gonna check out a couple of

686
00:32:58.879 --> 00:33:00.915
galleries on Queen West so.

687
00:33:00.965 --> 00:33:02.398
So it's all back on?

688
00:33:02.448 --> 00:33:03.231
That's great.

689
00:33:03.281 --> 00:33:05.364
Eh, it is and it isn't.

690
00:33:06.786 --> 00:33:08.039
John don't speak to
me in in betweens man.


691
00:33:08.063 --> 00:33:09.816
Okay I'm making flyers all day alright.

692
00:33:09.866 --> 00:33:11.679
Just tell me like it is.

693
00:33:11.729 --> 00:33:13.049
Alright look, when we parted it wasn't

694
00:33:13.073 --> 00:33:16.816
like she said "She screw
you jerk, get lost."


695
00:33:16.866 --> 00:33:20.232
It was more like, "Hey,
you're really cool,


696
00:33:20.282 --> 00:33:24.096
"but kinda weird, so
let's just be friends."


697
00:33:24.146 --> 00:33:25.592
What, you're just gonna go out with her

698
00:33:25.616 --> 00:33:26.949
just as friends?

699
00:33:27.978 --> 00:33:29.270
Yeah.

700
00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:31.178
And I don't know
how I feel about it.

701
00:33:31.228 --> 00:33:33.265
When girls say that, you're not supposed

702
00:33:33.315 --> 00:33:35.434
to actually go through with it.

703
00:33:35.484 --> 00:33:37.801
They still want nothing to do with you.

704
00:33:37.851 --> 00:33:39.610
It's just something they say because

705
00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:41.079
they don't have the guts to say

706
00:33:41.129 --> 00:33:42.729
"Screw you jerk, get lost."

707
00:33:42.779 --> 00:33:44.200
Taylor, it's not my fault.

708
00:33:44.250 --> 00:33:45.417
She texted me.

709
00:33:46.505 --> 00:33:47.288
Interesting.

710
00:33:47.338 --> 00:33:48.121
Yeah.

711
00:33:48.171 --> 00:33:50.893
So, I'm gonna see it through.

712
00:33:50.943 --> 00:33:53.832
Okay but that's energy, and time,

713
00:33:53.882 --> 00:33:55.848
and resources that would
be much better spent


714
00:33:55.898 --> 00:33:57.648
chasing another lead.

715
00:33:58.571 --> 00:34:03.378
Unless of course you actually
wanna be friends with her.


716
00:34:05.041 --> 00:34:06.671
Of course I don't.

717
00:34:06.721 --> 00:34:08.810
I mean that's total madness right?

718
00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:11.384
I mean did think that
I could be her friend


719
00:34:11.434 --> 00:34:12.368
for a little while.

720
00:34:12.418 --> 00:34:13.992
Let her get to know me better

721
00:34:14.042 --> 00:34:15.922
and then I could give it another shot.

722
00:34:15.972 --> 00:34:17.240
No you can't okay.

723
00:34:17.290 --> 00:34:18.100
Once you go into the friend zone

724
00:34:18.150 --> 00:34:19.567
you stay in the friend zone.

725
00:34:19.617 --> 00:34:21.053
But I can turn it around.

726
00:34:21.103 --> 00:34:23.864
There's no turning it around alright.

727
00:34:23.914 --> 00:34:26.261
Many have tried, everyone has failed.

728
00:34:26.311 --> 00:34:28.904
Any man who says differently is a liar.

729
00:34:28.954 --> 00:34:31.872
Look, transitions can
happen quite seamlessly.


730
00:34:31.922 --> 00:34:33.302
You my friend are living proof.

731
00:34:33.352 --> 00:34:35.258
One minute you're building
beer bongs with sorority gals,


732
00:34:35.282 --> 00:34:37.080
the next, you're the PTA guy.

733
00:34:37.130 --> 00:34:40.037
No, no, no, that's completely different.

734
00:34:40.087 --> 00:34:44.017
Alright, let me paint
you a picture here okay?


735
00:34:44.067 --> 00:34:47.414
When you're single, it's
all about finding the mate.


736
00:34:47.464 --> 00:34:49.445
Whether you're at the
bar with your buddies


737
00:34:49.495 --> 00:34:52.020
or playing sports, it's
still about gathering


738
00:34:52.070 --> 00:34:54.481
these ingredients that
make you the kind of guy


739
00:34:54.531 --> 00:34:57.270
who's gonna snag the perfect woman.

740
00:34:57.320 --> 00:34:58.179
Alright?

741
00:34:58.229 --> 00:35:00.824
It's primal, it's in our DNA.

742
00:35:00.874 --> 00:35:03.064
But then, once you have the family,

743
00:35:03.114 --> 00:35:05.181
the kids, and the wife, it's all about

744
00:35:05.231 --> 00:35:06.861
protecting the nest.

745
00:35:06.911 --> 00:35:08.998
Then you suddenly care about

746
00:35:09.048 --> 00:35:11.788
traffic calming zones, and PTA's,

747
00:35:11.838 --> 00:35:14.671
and making flyers for Laser Quest.

748
00:35:15.841 --> 00:35:17.219
Well that's it then.

749
00:35:17.269 --> 00:35:19.584
Well that's it, that's
how I'll win over Vanessa.


750
00:35:19.634 --> 00:35:21.364
Go to the community traffic forum?

751
00:35:21.414 --> 00:35:22.999
No, no, no, listen, listen.

752
00:35:23.049 --> 00:35:24.333
So when young people, right,

753
00:35:24.383 --> 00:35:26.136
they're still in the dating realm.

754
00:35:26.186 --> 00:35:28.828
The friend zone switcheroo
can not be accomplished.


755
00:35:28.878 --> 00:35:29.661
No.

756
00:35:29.711 --> 00:35:32.371
But Vanessa and I, we're getting older.

757
00:35:32.421 --> 00:35:34.004
Okay times a ticking.

758
00:35:34.054 --> 00:35:35.477
So soon all of her dating conquests,

759
00:35:35.501 --> 00:35:36.597
they will all have failed.

760
00:35:36.647 --> 00:35:39.147
She will start to realize
that her ovaries are rotting


761
00:35:39.197 --> 00:35:41.764
and she will get the itch
to make the switch over.


762
00:35:41.814 --> 00:35:42.757
Trust me, I have seen this happen,

763
00:35:42.807 --> 00:35:44.381
and it happens fast.

764
00:35:44.431 --> 00:35:46.229
Who does she turn to?

765
00:35:46.279 --> 00:35:48.396
I'll tell ya, whoever's around.

766
00:35:48.446 --> 00:35:49.533
Me.

767
00:35:49.583 --> 00:35:51.644
So now you're saying
you wanna marry this girl.


768
00:35:51.694 --> 00:35:55.390
Well I'm not having
much luck dating her.


769
00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:57.067
You're insane.

770
00:35:57.117 --> 00:35:58.117
But

771
00:35:59.189 --> 00:36:01.965
you may have some logic to your madness.

772
00:36:02.015 --> 00:36:03.015
But

773
00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:05.493
there are some risks involved.

774
00:36:05.543 --> 00:36:06.326
Such as?

775
00:36:06.376 --> 00:36:09.215
Well what if Mr. Right
comes along, then what?


776
00:36:09.265 --> 00:36:11.044
No, I'll get rid of those guys.

777
00:36:11.094 --> 00:36:12.427
Smear campaigns.

778
00:36:13.377 --> 00:36:16.786
The biggest pain to the friend zone

779
00:36:16.836 --> 00:36:18.669
is being the shoulder.

780
00:36:19.606 --> 00:36:20.844
The shoulder?

781
00:36:20.894 --> 00:36:22.931
The straight male support system.

782
00:36:22.981 --> 00:36:25.746
Okay, you never ever ever complain about

783
00:36:25.796 --> 00:36:28.031
a woman hanging out too
much with her friends


784
00:36:28.081 --> 00:36:28.968
or with gay dudes.

785
00:36:29.018 --> 00:36:31.165
Because those people allow us to escape

786
00:36:31.215 --> 00:36:34.464
this excruciating conversation.

787
00:36:34.514 --> 00:36:36.976
But the straight male support system guy,

788
00:36:37.026 --> 00:36:40.196
he's doomed to live that fate.

789
00:36:40.246 --> 00:36:41.806
I have never played such a role.

790
00:36:41.856 --> 00:36:43.416
Well I have.

791
00:36:43.466 --> 00:36:45.486
I mean for a little while
but I nipped it in the bud.


792
00:36:45.510 --> 00:36:46.959
But it's horrible, okay?

793
00:36:47.009 --> 00:36:49.106
They've got you on the
phone til three a.m.


794
00:36:49.156 --> 00:36:50.259
and they're talking about all these

795
00:36:50.283 --> 00:36:53.063
guys that they're dating
and how horrible they are.


796
00:36:53.113 --> 00:36:55.150
And she wishes she could just meet

797
00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:59.416
some nice, normal,
respectful guy like you.


798
00:36:59.466 --> 00:37:00.776
And it kills you inside.

799
00:37:00.826 --> 00:37:03.109
But then she drops this bomb.

800
00:37:03.159 --> 00:37:04.742
The sex is so good.

801
00:37:05.952 --> 00:37:08.142
She's gonna stay with the douche guys.

802
00:37:08.192 --> 00:37:09.385
That's brutal.

803
00:37:09.435 --> 00:37:11.330
It is brutal.

804
00:37:11.380 --> 00:37:14.929
Now, if it's on the
phone that's one thing.


805
00:37:14.979 --> 00:37:16.568
Because you can put the phone down

806
00:37:16.618 --> 00:37:18.567
and go make food or

807
00:37:18.617 --> 00:37:22.249
go jerk off to
porn or do something else.

808
00:37:22.299 --> 00:37:24.132
But if it's in person,

809
00:37:25.981 --> 00:37:27.148
man sometimes,

810
00:37:28.103 --> 00:37:30.125
sometimes she puts her arm around you.

811
00:37:30.175 --> 00:37:30.958
What?

812
00:37:31.008 --> 00:37:32.365
Sometimes she's sitting in your lap.

813
00:37:32.389 --> 00:37:33.172
No.

814
00:37:33.222 --> 00:37:36.035
Sometimes she's just wearing a bra.

815
00:37:36.085 --> 00:37:36.868
That's torture!

816
00:37:36.918 --> 00:37:37.714
Yes, I know!

817
00:37:37.764 --> 00:37:39.854
Okay that's why no self-respecting man

818
00:37:39.904 --> 00:37:41.635
lives in the friend zone.

819
00:37:41.685 --> 00:37:43.524
Alright because to live in the friend zone

820
00:37:43.574 --> 00:37:45.407
is to live as a unich.

821
00:37:46.859 --> 00:37:47.642
But the problem I have is,

822
00:37:47.692 --> 00:37:51.525
there is nobody else and
I want to pursue her.


823
00:37:54.324 --> 00:37:55.324
I hate to

824
00:37:56.366 --> 00:37:59.508
support this path you're going on but

825
00:37:59.558 --> 00:38:01.009
if you wanna go on it,

826
00:38:01.059 --> 00:38:02.642
here's what you do.

827
00:38:04.755 --> 00:38:06.609
You find that perfect guy.

828
00:38:06.659 --> 00:38:09.378
Not the guy that
she says that she wants.

829
00:38:09.428 --> 00:38:12.093
The guy that she
keeps going back to okay.

830
00:38:12.143 --> 00:38:15.218
You find out who that guy is,

831
00:38:15.268 --> 00:38:17.685
and then you become that guy.

832
00:38:19.688 --> 00:38:21.841
What do women want?

833
00:38:21.891 --> 00:38:23.808
What does Vanessa want?

834
00:38:25.523 --> 00:38:28.444
Are these questions even answerable?

835
00:38:28.494 --> 00:38:32.254
The fact that you've asked the question

836
00:38:32.304 --> 00:38:33.971
is half the journey.

837
00:38:34.934 --> 00:38:36.517
You go forward son.

838
00:38:39.168 --> 00:38:40.918
It's too late for me.

839
00:39:34.852 --> 00:39:37.033
Alright, great, why
don't we set up right here.


840
00:39:37.083 --> 00:39:37.866
Yeah sure.

841
00:39:37.916 --> 00:39:41.108
Great, thanks again
for agreeing to do this.


842
00:39:41.158 --> 00:39:43.991
First let me get this guy rolling.

843
00:39:45.482 --> 00:39:47.009
Sure.

844
00:39:47.059 --> 00:39:50.792
It's kind of a strange
place to do this no?


845
00:39:50.842 --> 00:39:51.649
Okay.

846
00:39:51.699 --> 00:39:53.494
So just like the ad said, 
I want to talk

847
00:39:53.544 --> 00:39:55.883
to you about your dating experience.

848
00:39:55.933 --> 00:39:57.172
Sean I mentioned that I wanted

849
00:39:57.222 --> 00:40:01.467
to meet a guy who did well
with young professional women.


850
00:40:01.517 --> 00:40:05.517
So tell me, how would you
go about meeting them?


851
00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:08.817
I'll be at a bar right?

852
00:40:08.867 --> 00:40:10.878
And I'll be on
my own just looking around

853
00:40:10.928 --> 00:40:13.032
and maybe there'll be a bunch of ladies,

854
00:40:13.082 --> 00:40:14.865
mostly keep to themselves,
but maybe there'll


855
00:40:14.915 --> 00:40:16.879
be one that keeps looking my way.

856
00:40:16.929 --> 00:40:19.362
So when her friends
are in the ladies room

857
00:40:19.412 --> 00:40:21.202
or whatever, I'll go over and strike

858
00:40:21.252 --> 00:40:22.420
up a conversation.

859
00:40:22.470 --> 00:40:24.970
Now, I'm casual, but I'm firm.

860
00:40:26.209 --> 00:40:28.149
'Cause the ladies,
particularly the professionals,


861
00:40:28.173 --> 00:40:29.253
they like it firm.

862
00:40:29.303 --> 00:40:31.007
That's the key you know what I'm saying?

863
00:40:31.057 --> 00:40:32.237
They don't wanna be boss anymore,

864
00:40:32.261 --> 00:40:34.329
they wanna be bossed around.

865
00:40:34.379 --> 00:40:36.344
So I tell her, not so much asking,

866
00:40:36.394 --> 00:40:37.901
more like telling her,

867
00:40:37.951 --> 00:40:39.986
"Maybe you and me should meet up later."

868
00:40:40.036 --> 00:40:44.464
Okay, so you think firmness
is a big part of this.


869
00:40:44.514 --> 00:40:46.204
Yeah, you gotta be firm.

870
00:40:46.254 --> 00:40:48.106
'Cause she says yes
and then we meet up

871
00:40:48.156 --> 00:40:49.367
at another bar right?

872
00:40:49.417 --> 00:40:54.080
But then a little bit
later, she's just begging.


873
00:40:54.130 --> 00:40:55.282
For?

874
00:40:55.332 --> 00:40:56.543
It.

875
00:40:56.593 --> 00:40:58.051
Begging for it?

876
00:40:58.101 --> 00:40:59.601
Oh yeah, for it.

877
00:41:01.068 --> 00:41:03.952
Sean, what do you
think it is about you

878
00:41:04.002 --> 00:41:06.898
in particular that makes her beg for it?

879
00:41:06.948 --> 00:41:07.948
Well.

880
00:41:08.758 --> 00:41:09.758
Hey.

881
00:41:12.733 --> 00:41:13.733
Right?

882
00:41:14.604 --> 00:41:16.004
Right?

883
00:41:16.054 --> 00:41:17.248
Sure, yeah.

884
00:41:17.298 --> 00:41:18.715
That makes sense.

885
00:41:19.577 --> 00:41:22.152
So Sean, do you carry yourself

886
00:41:22.202 --> 00:41:24.341
in any particular ways?

887
00:41:24.391 --> 00:41:25.844
Well there's a lot of palookas out there

888
00:41:25.868 --> 00:41:29.660
and make no mistake,
Sean ain't no palooka.


889
00:41:29.710 --> 00:41:31.225
No, no of course he's not.

890
00:41:31.275 --> 00:41:32.461
So I don't whine.

891
00:41:32.511 --> 00:41:36.533
I'm not like, "Excuse me miss,
maybe if possible we could."


892
00:41:36.583 --> 00:41:38.139
No, no.

893
00:41:38.189 --> 00:41:39.472
When you're dealing with Sean he lays it

894
00:41:39.496 --> 00:41:40.593
on the table straight.

895
00:41:40.643 --> 00:41:41.973
And the ladies respond.

896
00:41:42.023 --> 00:41:43.925
They like the way I walk,
they like the way I talk.


897
00:41:43.949 --> 00:41:45.843
It's all good man.

898
00:41:45.893 --> 00:41:49.307
Wow, you have covered
a lot of ground for me.


899
00:41:49.357 --> 00:41:52.803
And frankly, I don't know if
I have any more questions.


900
00:41:52.853 --> 00:41:54.304
Well I was just getting started.

901
00:41:54.354 --> 00:41:55.847
Oh, okay.

902
00:41:55.897 --> 00:41:57.529
Well what else did you have to say?

903
00:41:57.579 --> 00:41:58.529
Don't you wanna hear all the details

904
00:41:58.579 --> 00:42:00.197
of what happens when I get the ladies

905
00:42:00.247 --> 00:42:01.299
up to my place huh?

906
00:42:01.349 --> 00:42:02.357
Well I think...

907
00:42:02.407 --> 00:42:03.923
Or maybe you want me to
pull it out right here.


908
00:42:03.947 --> 00:42:05.331
Oh excuse me?

909
00:42:05.381 --> 00:42:07.129
Do you want me to
jerk off here or no?

910
00:42:07.179 --> 00:42:09.187
Why the hell would you do that?

911
00:42:09.237 --> 00:42:12.087
Is this some kind of joke?

912
00:42:12.137 --> 00:42:13.137
Quiet!

913
00:42:14.457 --> 00:42:16.104
You're the guy who puts up an ad

914
00:42:16.154 --> 00:42:18.339
saying that he wants a
good looking stallion


915
00:42:18.389 --> 00:42:19.629
for a solo video where he chats

916
00:42:19.665 --> 00:42:21.165
about what he does with his women.

917
00:42:21.215 --> 00:42:22.509
No, no, no, no, Sean, Sean, Sean,

918
00:42:22.533 --> 00:42:25.531
there's clearly been some confusion here.

919
00:42:25.581 --> 00:42:26.946
I just wanted to meet
someone for dating advice,


920
00:42:26.970 --> 00:42:28.894
that is all, that is it.

921
00:42:28.944 --> 00:42:29.748
So you don't want me to jerk off?

922
00:42:29.798 --> 00:42:31.472
No, god please stop saying that.

923
00:42:31.522 --> 00:42:32.305
Are you sure?

924
00:42:32.355 --> 00:42:33.138
Yeah I'm sure.

925
00:42:33.188 --> 00:42:33.971
This is ridiculous.

926
00:42:34.021 --> 00:42:36.489
Hey, it's what I do.

927
00:42:36.539 --> 00:42:38.735
Don't demean my profession.

928
00:42:38.785 --> 00:42:39.940
I'm sorry.

929
00:42:39.990 --> 00:42:41.174
I'm very very sorry.

930
00:42:41.224 --> 00:42:42.465
Clearly there's been some

931
00:42:42.515 --> 00:42:44.432
large misunderstanding.

932
00:42:46.038 --> 00:42:48.288
Here, here is the 20 bucks.

933
00:42:49.374 --> 00:42:50.396
Thank you for coming out.

934
00:42:50.446 --> 00:42:51.229
Okay well if you're paying anyway

935
00:42:51.279 --> 00:42:52.224
I can bring out...

936
00:42:52.274 --> 00:42:53.451
We're done here, we are done.

937
00:42:53.475 --> 00:42:54.688
Done and done and done.

938
00:42:54.738 --> 00:42:55.521
Thank you.

939
00:42:55.571 --> 00:42:56.571
Geez man.

940
00:42:57.522 --> 00:42:58.305
You know if you want some advice on

941
00:42:58.355 --> 00:42:59.543
how to be easy with the ladies

942
00:42:59.567 --> 00:43:01.301
you gotta learn to simmer down.

943
00:43:01.351 --> 00:43:02.924
Take it smooth.

944
00:43:02.974 --> 00:43:04.010
That is a great point.

945
00:43:04.060 --> 00:43:05.589
And you are right, thank you.

946
00:43:05.639 --> 00:43:06.422
Yup.

947
00:43:06.472 --> 00:43:07.255
Just saying.

948
00:43:07.305 --> 00:43:09.041
Yup, thank you, thank you.

949
00:43:09.091 --> 00:43:10.091
Holy.

950
00:43:15.691 --> 00:43:17.918
The macho guys I
am supposed to be like

951
00:43:17.968 --> 00:43:21.658
mess around on the side for 20 bucks.

952
00:43:21.708 --> 00:43:23.875
What the hell is going on?

953
00:43:25.044 --> 00:43:26.961
This project is doomed.

954
00:43:41.255 --> 00:43:43.597
Okay, what have we learned so far?

955
00:43:43.647 --> 00:43:44.927
It's all about the confidence,

956
00:43:44.977 --> 00:43:46.946
and the confidence is all about the walk.

957
00:43:46.996 --> 00:43:48.063
Right, got you.

958
00:43:48.113 --> 00:43:50.484
Show me your walk.

959
00:43:50.534 --> 00:43:51.534
Okay okay.

960
00:43:56.480 --> 00:43:57.691
Not natural at all.

961
00:43:57.741 --> 00:44:00.241
Go back, lead with your chest.

962
00:44:01.105 --> 00:44:05.855
Hurry up man,.

963
00:44:06.963 --> 00:44:09.190
Okay no, try with your chin.

964
00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:10.362
With the chin yeah.

965
00:44:10.412 --> 00:44:11.195
The actual chin?

966
00:44:11.245 --> 00:44:12.245
Yes sir.

967
00:44:14.717 --> 00:44:16.336
Okay John no, no, no, no, no.

968
00:44:16.386 --> 00:44:17.658
Stop, stop, stop.

969
00:44:17.708 --> 00:44:18.745
Try with your dick.

970
00:44:18.795 --> 00:44:19.578
With my what?

971
00:44:19.628 --> 00:44:21.875
Your dick, lead with your groin.

972
00:44:21.925 --> 00:44:22.747
This is ridiculous.

973
00:44:22.797 --> 00:44:24.047
Hurry up man!

974
00:44:28.247 --> 00:44:29.247
I don't.

975
00:44:32.059 --> 00:44:33.550
It looks terrible man.

976
00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:35.406
Look, I'm not a confident walker okay.

977
00:44:35.456 --> 00:44:36.493
I'm an awkward guy.

978
00:44:36.543 --> 00:44:37.885
We exist.

979
00:44:37.935 --> 00:44:41.289
Okay, secret weapon, secret weapon.

980
00:44:41.339 --> 00:44:42.860
Okay, here.

981
00:44:42.910 --> 00:44:45.079
No, no, no, no, no,
I don't do suits okay.


982
00:44:45.129 --> 00:44:46.297
I can't pull 'em off.

983
00:44:46.347 --> 00:44:47.468
They don't look natural on me.

984
00:44:47.492 --> 00:44:49.835
John this is not a
suit, it's a sports coat.


985
00:44:49.885 --> 00:44:51.223
Pretty sure they're the same thing.

986
00:44:51.247 --> 00:44:52.030
I don't know the difference,

987
00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:52.983
but I do know
that if you call it

988
00:44:53.033 --> 00:44:54.658
a sports coat it seems more natural

989
00:44:54.708 --> 00:44:56.541
to just wear it about.

990
00:44:58.079 --> 00:44:58.984
Fine, I'll try it.

991
00:44:59.034 --> 00:45:00.086
Thank you.

992
00:45:00.136 --> 00:45:00.919
It's not gonna work.

993
00:45:00.969 --> 00:45:02.469
It's gonna work.

994
00:45:09.126 --> 00:45:10.499
Huh.

995
00:45:10.549 --> 00:45:12.904
This actually doesn't feel too bad.

996
00:45:12.954 --> 00:45:14.441
It kinda molds you.

997
00:45:14.491 --> 00:45:15.513
I haven't worn one of these since

998
00:45:15.537 --> 00:45:16.761
my grandfather's funeral.

999
00:45:16.811 --> 00:45:17.749
And that's the problem man,

1000
00:45:17.799 --> 00:45:19.331
the clothes make the man.

1001
00:45:19.381 --> 00:45:22.142
Now, walk, with your chest.

1002
00:45:22.192 --> 00:45:22.975
Okay.

1003
00:45:23.025 --> 00:45:23.808
Let's give it another shot.

1004
00:45:23.858 --> 00:45:24.858
Okay okay.

1005
00:45:30.865 --> 00:45:32.494
There it is.

1006
00:45:32.544 --> 00:45:34.032
Not too shabby.

1007
00:45:34.082 --> 00:45:35.424
That's a walk.

1008
00:45:35.474 --> 00:45:37.404
I was almost strutting.

1009
00:45:37.454 --> 00:45:40.258
We have made a man
out of you after all.

1010
00:45:40.308 --> 00:45:42.391
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1011
00:45:43.737 --> 00:45:45.110
Hello ladies.

1012
00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:47.851
May I interest you in a
vintage copy of Kafka.


1013
00:45:47.901 --> 00:45:49.637
Perhaps later we can have a little

1014
00:45:49.687 --> 00:45:51.770
metamorphosis of our own.

1015
00:45:55.381 --> 00:45:56.650
I think we've done it man.

1016
00:45:56.700 --> 00:45:57.869
You can now confidently walk through

1017
00:45:57.893 --> 00:45:59.583
the galleries of Queen
West without holding


1018
00:45:59.633 --> 00:46:01.160
your head in shame.

1019
00:46:01.210 --> 00:46:03.190
My bucket list gets shorter by the day.

1020
00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:04.400
Come in for the real thing.

1021
00:46:49.686 --> 00:46:52.364
So, no condo after all huh?

1022
00:46:52.414 --> 00:46:54.468
No, we
couldn't get the mortgage.


1023
00:46:54.518 --> 00:46:56.351
At least not the terms we wanted.

1024
00:46:56.401 --> 00:46:58.396
It's for the best in the end.

1025
00:46:58.446 --> 00:47:01.279
Oh see, now this, this is great.

1026
00:47:02.522 --> 00:47:05.528
I never would of thought
you knew anything about art.


1027
00:47:05.578 --> 00:47:06.606
Oh I don't.

1028
00:47:06.656 --> 00:47:08.183
But working at a book store you kinda

1029
00:47:08.233 --> 00:47:10.898
learn tidbits about everything.

1030
00:47:10.948 --> 00:47:12.665
Are you gonna stay there a while?

1031
00:47:12.715 --> 00:47:13.996
No, it's just short term.

1032
00:47:14.046 --> 00:47:14.829
Oh yeah?

1033
00:47:14.879 --> 00:47:15.810
How long have you been there?

1034
00:47:15.860 --> 00:47:17.162
Seven years.

1035
00:47:17.212 --> 00:47:19.176
But I'm actually thinking
about buying the place.


1036
00:47:19.226 --> 00:47:20.009
You know, the owner's getting old

1037
00:47:20.059 --> 00:47:22.625
and I figured I could get a loan.

1038
00:47:22.675 --> 00:47:25.061
That would be cool
to own your own place.


1039
00:47:25.111 --> 00:47:26.078
Yeah.

1040
00:47:26.128 --> 00:47:26.917
But do you really think a bank

1041
00:47:26.967 --> 00:47:28.936
would give you a
loan for a book store?

1042
00:47:28.986 --> 00:47:31.615
Isn't it a tough industry?

1043
00:47:31.665 --> 00:47:34.082
Yeah maybe I won't do that.

1044
00:47:35.756 --> 00:47:37.910
I used to work in a book
store when I was in school.


1045
00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:39.460
I really loved it.

1046
00:47:40.756 --> 00:47:44.010
Yeah you should know
this wasn't my plan.


1047
00:47:44.060 --> 00:47:45.910
Yeah for sure.

1048
00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:48.957
I just don't have many
other options right now.


1049
00:47:49.007 --> 00:47:50.175
Sure you do.

1050
00:47:50.225 --> 00:47:52.101
Yeah well I've kinda used them all up.

1051
00:47:52.151 --> 00:47:53.151
How?

1052
00:47:53.949 --> 00:47:55.286
I spent a lot of years trying to

1053
00:47:55.310 --> 00:47:57.541
make it in some stupid band.

1054
00:47:57.591 --> 00:47:58.900
That's awesome.

1055
00:47:58.950 --> 00:48:00.484
Except I can't sing.

1056
00:48:00.534 --> 00:48:01.317
Who cares?

1057
00:48:01.367 --> 00:48:02.846
Only the lead singer needs to sing.

1058
00:48:02.896 --> 00:48:05.396
Yeah, I was the lead singer.

1059
00:48:06.392 --> 00:48:07.175
Oh.

1060
00:48:07.225 --> 00:48:08.314
Yeah.

1061
00:48:08.364 --> 00:48:10.185
Well, at least you tried.

1062
00:48:10.235 --> 00:48:12.026
Can't say the same.

1063
00:48:12.076 --> 00:48:13.588
What are you talking about?

1064
00:48:13.638 --> 00:48:16.882
You have your degree and
you're working in your field.


1065
00:48:16.932 --> 00:48:17.899
That's great.

1066
00:48:17.949 --> 00:48:20.231
Yeah, and now I'm back at square one.

1067
00:48:20.281 --> 00:48:21.417
Yeah but you have a great job here.

1068
00:48:21.441 --> 00:48:23.684
I'm sure your one in
Vancouver was pretty sweet.


1069
00:48:23.734 --> 00:48:25.424
Nothing worth mentioning.

1070
00:48:25.474 --> 00:48:26.932
Alright, well look at it this way.

1071
00:48:26.982 --> 00:48:29.832
Okay, you're starting a new chapter,

1072
00:48:29.882 --> 00:48:31.993
you're in a new city,

1073
00:48:32.043 --> 00:48:34.036
you're beautiful,

1074
00:48:34.086 --> 00:48:36.020
you're the toast of the town.

1075
00:48:36.070 --> 00:48:37.070
Thanks.

1076
00:48:38.698 --> 00:48:41.169
You don't need to be such a downer.

1077
00:48:41.219 --> 00:48:42.677
Look who's talking.

1078
00:48:42.727 --> 00:48:44.521
Hey, I have downer street cred.

1079
00:48:44.571 --> 00:48:46.866
I have a lot of downer experience.

1080
00:48:46.916 --> 00:48:48.166
I've earned it.

1081
00:48:49.733 --> 00:48:52.162
This one is really good.

1082
00:48:52.212 --> 00:48:53.962
Totally wanna buy it.

1083
00:48:58.244 --> 00:49:01.485
Look, I don't wanna tiptoe around

1084
00:49:01.535 --> 00:49:02.958
what happened the last time we hung out.

1085
00:49:02.982 --> 00:49:04.556
I just wanna get it off my chest

1086
00:49:04.606 --> 00:49:05.872
and I wanna say I'm really sorry for

1087
00:49:05.896 --> 00:49:08.417
everything that happened.

1088
00:49:08.467 --> 00:49:09.250
It's okay.

1089
00:49:09.300 --> 00:49:11.534
No, no, it's really not okay.

1090
00:49:11.584 --> 00:49:13.548
Because I have this apology conversation

1091
00:49:13.598 --> 00:49:15.695
with people all the time.

1092
00:49:15.745 --> 00:49:19.059
And it's becoming a pattern
and frankly, it has to stop.


1093
00:49:19.109 --> 00:49:20.303
Look, honestly I think it's cool

1094
00:49:20.327 --> 00:49:23.580
that you're just willing
to hang out with me.


1095
00:49:23.630 --> 00:49:27.643
I didn't think you'd be okay
with just being friends.


1096
00:49:27.693 --> 00:49:29.026
Totes magotes.

1097
00:49:30.144 --> 00:49:31.461
Good, 'cause I could really use

1098
00:49:31.485 --> 00:49:34.250
a good friend right now.

1099
00:49:34.300 --> 00:49:35.092
Really?

1100
00:49:35.142 --> 00:49:37.196
Yes, I have been
on a date with a

1101
00:49:37.246 --> 00:49:38.747
different guy every single day

1102
00:49:38.797 --> 00:49:41.011
and it's just getting too
much, you know what I mean?


1103
00:49:41.061 --> 00:49:43.877
Like I just need a break.

1104
00:49:43.927 --> 00:49:47.009
Yeah, I'm actually
just coming off a break.


1105
00:49:47.059 --> 00:49:48.848
I was hoping to jump right back on.

1106
00:49:48.898 --> 00:49:50.009
Yeah, I keep trying that

1107
00:49:50.059 --> 00:49:52.618
but I just can't say no.

1108
00:49:52.668 --> 00:49:54.069
It's tough out there.

1109
00:49:54.119 --> 00:49:55.129
Like a jungle.

1110
00:49:55.179 --> 00:49:56.432
Tell me about it.

1111
00:49:56.482 --> 00:49:58.113
On the West Coast they come
up to you and ask you out,


1112
00:49:58.137 --> 00:49:59.345
but here it's unrelenting.

1113
00:49:59.395 --> 00:50:00.562
Bam, bam, bam.

1114
00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:03.044
Bam?

1115
00:50:03.094 --> 00:50:06.429
Yeah, that's another thing, the sex.

1116
00:50:06.479 --> 00:50:09.219
Oh wow, you're taking
a break from that too.


1117
00:50:09.269 --> 00:50:11.744
I hear ya, I've
done the same at times.

1118
00:50:11.794 --> 00:50:13.178
Self-imposed of course.

1119
00:50:13.228 --> 00:50:15.135
No, not a break from that.

1120
00:50:15.185 --> 00:50:16.863
I mean I wish, but
I just keep doing it,

1121
00:50:16.913 --> 00:50:18.108
and doing it, and doing it.

1122
00:50:18.158 --> 00:50:22.674
Even though I tell myself
not to, it's exhausting.


1123
00:50:22.724 --> 00:50:24.805
Well, good news,

1124
00:50:24.855 --> 00:50:26.750
'cause this is your night off

1125
00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:27.800
from that.

1126
00:50:29.031 --> 00:50:30.031
Yeah!

1127
00:50:30.064 --> 00:50:32.302
And isn't it fantastic?

1128
00:50:32.352 --> 00:50:35.350
I could just take a deep
breath in and relax.


1129
00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:36.400
No pressure.

1130
00:50:37.282 --> 00:50:38.590
Normally at this point there would be

1131
00:50:38.614 --> 00:50:40.814
all that tension about if
we're gonna do it later.


1132
00:50:40.864 --> 00:50:43.294
Or at a bar it would like,
"Oh if he's paying too much


1133
00:50:43.344 --> 00:50:44.833
"now I have to go through with it."

1134
00:50:44.883 --> 00:50:47.657
Just like the mental
calculations that don't end.


1135
00:50:47.707 --> 00:50:51.374
And yet for us, we both
know where we stand.


1136
00:50:52.295 --> 00:50:53.295
Yeah.

1137
00:50:58.513 --> 00:51:00.713
Isn't it awesome.

1138
00:51:00.763 --> 00:51:04.069
Totally liberating.

1139
00:51:04.119 --> 00:51:05.786
You'll survive it.

1140
00:51:07.871 --> 00:51:09.371

I'll bet you were the uber preppy one.

1170
00:53:25.207 --> 00:53:26.060
I wasn't.

1171
00:53:26.110 --> 00:53:27.420
No, no, even better, even better.

1172
00:53:27.444 --> 00:53:28.322
I bet you were the girl in class

1173
00:53:28.372 --> 00:53:30.552
that wrote in those girly
little bubble letters.


1174
00:53:30.602 --> 00:53:32.394
John, if you must know,

1175
00:53:32.444 --> 00:53:33.844
I was suspended.

1176
00:53:33.894 --> 00:53:35.340
Ooh for what?

1177
00:53:35.390 --> 00:53:38.904
We smashed the principles
car windshield in grade six.


1178
00:53:38.954 --> 00:53:40.340
That's actually pretty badass.

1179
00:53:40.390 --> 00:53:42.126
Yeah exactly.

1180
00:53:42.176 --> 00:53:43.588
What's the worst thing got up to?

1181
00:53:43.638 --> 00:53:45.227
Forgetting to go to book club one week?

1182
00:53:45.277 --> 00:53:46.561
Can you just back off?

1183
00:53:46.611 --> 00:53:48.317
Okay I was a very sensitive young man.

1184
00:53:48.367 --> 00:53:49.749
Awe so lame.

1185
00:53:49.799 --> 00:53:51.549
Vanessa.

1186
00:53:53.556 --> 00:53:54.723
Hey, Javier.

1187
00:53:55.659 --> 00:53:58.348
Hi, I'm Javier.

1188
00:53:58.398 --> 00:53:59.181
Who are you?

1189
00:53:59.231 --> 00:54:02.064
Hey, I'm John, nice to meet you.

1190
00:54:03.242 --> 00:54:04.242
Hey.

1191
00:54:09.230 --> 00:54:10.742
So what's shaking?

1192
00:54:10.792 --> 00:54:13.634
Oh not much, we're just hanging out.

1193
00:54:13.684 --> 00:54:15.732
I told you about my friend John right?

1194
00:54:15.782 --> 00:54:16.997
Oh.

1195
00:54:17.047 --> 00:54:18.938
You're the weird guy.

1196
00:54:18.988 --> 00:54:20.256
I never said that.

1197
00:54:20.306 --> 00:54:22.112
Yeah, yeah that's me.

1198
00:54:22.162 --> 00:54:24.503
Creepy John they call me.

1199
00:54:24.553 --> 00:54:26.188
Why do they call you that?

1200
00:54:26.238 --> 00:54:27.796
It's a joke.

1201
00:54:27.846 --> 00:54:29.214
I'd be pissed if my
friends called me that.


1202
00:54:29.238 --> 00:54:32.452
No, no, I mean it's a
joke I made right now.


1203
00:54:32.502 --> 00:54:34.323
Besides, they wouldn't
call you creepy Javier.


1204
00:54:34.373 --> 00:54:37.123
They'd probably call you like hazy Javier.

1205
00:54:37.173 --> 00:54:38.552
Are you making fun of my lazy eye?

1206
00:54:38.576 --> 00:54:39.641
What, no, god no.

1207
00:54:39.691 --> 00:54:42.196
No your eyes look perfect.

1208
00:54:42.246 --> 00:54:43.271
Yeah, that's right.

1209
00:54:43.321 --> 00:54:46.561
Okay, so we're just
having fun, right guys?


1210
00:54:46.611 --> 00:54:47.621
Speaking of.

1211
00:54:47.671 --> 00:54:48.454
Yeah.

1212
00:54:48.504 --> 00:54:49.327
I was meeting
a couple pals here.


1213
00:54:49.377 --> 00:54:50.906
We're gonna head to the
bowling alley downtown.


1214
00:54:50.930 --> 00:54:51.808
You wanna come?

1215
00:54:51.858 --> 00:54:53.735
Yeah, it sounds awesome.

1216
00:54:53.785 --> 00:54:55.683
You in creepy?

1217
00:54:55.733 --> 00:54:57.001
No, thank you.

1218
00:54:57.051 --> 00:54:59.917
I actually have a job
interview in the morning so...


1219
00:54:59.967 --> 00:55:00.750
Wait what?

1220
00:55:00.800 --> 00:55:02.264
You never mentioned that.

1221
00:55:02.314 --> 00:55:04.004
Yeah, yeah, it's nothing really.

1222
00:55:04.054 --> 00:55:05.569
I mean I don't really expect
anything to come from it.


1223
00:55:05.593 --> 00:55:07.399
I just putting out feelers.

1224
00:55:07.449 --> 00:55:09.485
Well good luck.

1225
00:55:09.535 --> 00:55:10.535
Thanks.

1226
00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:12.847
Well yeah, I should go.

1227
00:55:12.897 --> 00:55:14.065
I'm gonna leave this.

1228
00:55:14.115 --> 00:55:15.182
John you don't have to.

1229
00:55:15.232 --> 00:55:16.965
I insist, I wanna cover yours.

1230
00:55:17.015 --> 00:55:19.182
Javier, great to meet you.

1231
00:56:02.450 --> 00:56:03.450
Sorry.

1232
00:56:30.360 --> 00:56:33.357
So why do you wanna become an analyst?

1233
00:56:33.407 --> 00:56:36.257
I appreciate the question.

1234
00:56:36.307 --> 00:56:38.550
After a lot of reflection
I believe that my future


1235
00:56:38.600 --> 00:56:42.012
is not in the book sales industry.

1236
00:56:42.062 --> 00:56:44.029
And the analytic skills
that I have developed


1237
00:56:44.079 --> 00:56:48.746
over the years would allow
me to flourish as an analyst.


1238
00:56:51.039 --> 00:56:52.859
Okay, so what would you
say you learned the most


1239
00:56:52.883 --> 00:56:56.633
while earning your degree
in Women's Studies?


1240
00:56:57.840 --> 00:56:59.735
Well I can definitely
tell you after four


1241
00:56:59.785 --> 00:57:03.785
years of study I still
know nothing about women.


1242
00:57:04.684 --> 00:57:07.043
So information retention
isn't your strength?


1243
00:57:07.093 --> 00:57:08.957
No, no, no, no I wouldn't say that.

1244
00:57:09.007 --> 00:57:11.610
No, I just mean
that I thrive on putting

1245
00:57:11.660 --> 00:57:14.410
myself in challenging situations.

1246
00:57:16.273 --> 00:57:17.273
Okay.

1247
00:57:18.171 --> 00:57:21.021
So we're going to do
a self-evaluation now.


1248
00:57:21.071 --> 00:57:22.614
I'll give you a series of questions

1249
00:57:22.664 --> 00:57:25.124
and you will rate yourself
on a scale of one to 10,


1250
00:57:25.174 --> 00:57:26.863
with one being the lowest
rating you can give yourself


1251
00:57:26.887 --> 00:57:29.300
and 10 being the highest, okay?

1252
00:57:29.350 --> 00:57:33.683
So I can just give myself
whatever ranking I want?


1253
00:57:36.715 --> 00:57:39.160
The goal here, is provide an accurate

1254
00:57:39.210 --> 00:57:43.160
assessment of your
skills in the workplace.


1255
00:57:43.210 --> 00:57:44.210
Okay.

1256
00:57:45.644 --> 00:57:47.469
Alright then, and how would you rank

1257
00:57:47.519 --> 00:57:49.686
your communication skills?

1258
00:57:52.755 --> 00:57:53.755
Nine?

1259
00:57:55.028 --> 00:57:56.028
Excellent.

1260
00:57:58.091 --> 00:58:00.966
And how would you rank
your analytic skills?


1261
00:58:01.016 --> 00:58:02.491
Nine?

1262
00:58:02.541 --> 00:58:03.883
Your interpersonal skills?

1263
00:58:03.933 --> 00:58:04.796
Oh that's a 10.

1264
00:58:04.846 --> 00:58:07.225
That is definitely a 10.

1265
00:58:07.275 --> 00:58:10.156
Excellent, and how about
your leadership skills?


1266
00:58:10.206 --> 00:58:12.784
Well, let's say eight.

1267
00:58:12.834 --> 00:58:14.957
You know, I'm not looking to make CEO.

1268
00:58:15.007 --> 00:58:16.007
Yet.

1269
00:58:18.461 --> 00:58:21.293
Okay, now I see here you ran a

1270
00:58:21.343 --> 00:58:24.367
girls public speaking contest.

1271
00:58:24.417 --> 00:58:25.206
Tell me about that.

1272
00:58:25.256 --> 00:58:26.801
Yes, yes, that is just a little

1273
00:58:26.851 --> 00:58:28.891
pet project of mine.

1274
00:58:28.941 --> 00:58:31.081
I just, I firmly believe that it's

1275
00:58:31.131 --> 00:58:34.629
very important to give
back to the community.


1276
00:58:34.679 --> 00:58:39.358
Because if girls don't have
a voice in our society,


1277
00:58:39.408 --> 00:58:40.575
we can't grow.

1278
00:58:53.152 --> 00:58:54.152
Sorry.

1279
00:58:55.396 --> 00:58:56.396
Well John,

1280
00:58:57.962 --> 00:59:00.390
I will give your application
to our staffing consultants


1281
00:59:00.440 --> 00:59:03.308
and if something comes
up they'll be in touch.


1282
00:59:03.358 --> 00:59:04.141
That's it?

1283
00:59:04.191 --> 00:59:05.191
That's it.

1284
00:59:06.066 --> 00:59:07.149
How'd I do?

1285
00:59:08.014 --> 00:59:09.240
I can't disclose that.

1286
00:59:09.290 --> 00:59:10.290
Right.

1287
00:59:10.983 --> 00:59:14.483
But we appreciate you coming here today.

1288
00:59:16.540 --> 00:59:17.790
I start next week.

1289
00:59:17.840 --> 00:59:20.260
What the hell is a Junior
Logistics Analyst anyway?


1290
00:59:20.310 --> 00:59:22.620
No clue, isn't it great?

1291
00:59:22.670 --> 00:59:24.057
Yeah, really great.

1292
00:59:24.107 --> 00:59:25.348
Oh come on.

1293
00:59:25.398 --> 00:59:26.181
What?

1294
00:59:26.231 --> 00:59:27.273
You expect me to be happy about this?

1295
00:59:27.297 --> 00:59:29.319
Yes, I'm moving up.

1296
00:59:29.369 --> 00:59:30.468
You're selling out.

1297
00:59:30.518 --> 00:59:31.712
How?

1298
00:59:31.762 --> 00:59:33.276
I'm just getting a permanent job.

1299
00:59:33.326 --> 00:59:34.784
You already have one.

1300
00:59:34.834 --> 00:59:36.526
I'm not going anywhere here.

1301
00:59:36.576 --> 00:59:37.816
This isn't a career.

1302
00:59:37.866 --> 00:59:39.540
Because we already have careers.

1303
00:59:39.590 --> 00:59:40.687
We're artists!

1304
00:59:40.737 --> 00:59:42.864
This is what we
do to support our careers!

1305
00:59:42.914 --> 00:59:44.910
We are not artists.

1306
00:59:44.960 --> 00:59:48.472
I sang in a band once and you
draw cartoons on the side.


1307
00:59:48.522 --> 00:59:49.724
That's my art!

1308
00:59:49.774 --> 00:59:50.968
That's what I'm passionate about.

1309
00:59:50.992 --> 00:59:51.939
Don't knock that.

1310
00:59:51.989 --> 00:59:53.273
I know.

1311
00:59:53.323 --> 00:59:55.060
And you should pursue your passion okay.

1312
00:59:55.110 --> 00:59:57.230
But you're 23 years old.

1313
00:59:57.280 --> 00:59:58.724
You might have a graphic novel coming out

1314
00:59:58.748 --> 00:59:59.531
in a year or two.

1315
00:59:59.581 --> 01:00:00.755
I won't.

1316
01:00:00.805 --> 01:00:03.075
We're in totally different
places in our lives.


1317
01:00:03.125 --> 01:00:04.596
But we're buddies man.

1318
01:00:04.646 --> 01:00:06.660
We're partners in crime,
we solve mysteries.


1319
01:00:06.710 --> 01:00:10.127
We help people find alphabetized books.

1320
01:00:11.477 --> 01:00:13.760
Look, my time with Vanessa
has made me realize


1321
01:00:13.810 --> 01:00:15.615
I wanna know where I'll be

1322
01:00:15.665 --> 01:00:17.606
and what I'll be doing
five years from now.


1323
01:00:17.656 --> 01:00:18.460
You know, I knew that harlot

1324
01:00:18.510 --> 01:00:21.093
would get between our bromance.

1325
01:00:22.165 --> 01:00:24.377
Every bromance comes to an end.

1326
01:00:24.427 --> 01:00:27.029
But you were my first man.

1327
01:00:27.079 --> 01:00:29.871
I promise you I won't be your last.

1328
01:00:29.921 --> 01:00:33.504
Not every bro could
rock glasses like that.


1329
01:00:37.419 --> 01:00:39.383
Thanks brother.

1330
01:00:39.433 --> 01:00:40.775
It's just I'm gonna miss you man.

1331
01:00:40.825 --> 01:00:43.742
Yeah, we've had some great times.

1332
01:00:47.928 --> 01:00:49.723
I want you to have these.

1333
01:00:49.773 --> 01:00:52.000
No, I can't take them.

1334
01:00:52.050 --> 01:00:53.050
No really.

1335
01:00:53.090 --> 01:00:54.985
I wanna give you my signature look.

1336
01:00:55.035 --> 01:00:56.272
No seriously, I can't take those.

1337
01:00:56.296 --> 01:00:57.317
I'll look like an idiot.

1338
01:00:57.367 --> 01:00:58.503
I mean they work for your face

1339
01:00:58.527 --> 01:01:00.194
but eh eh, not mine.

1340
01:01:01.168 --> 01:01:02.873
Yeah that's true.

1341
01:01:02.923 --> 01:01:03.923
Sorry.

1342
01:01:05.603 --> 01:01:08.480
It's just a temp position,
a three month contract.


1343
01:01:08.530 --> 01:01:09.742
Well it's still something.

1344
01:01:09.792 --> 01:01:12.934
You probably beat out a
lot of people to get it.


1345
01:01:12.984 --> 01:01:16.225
Yeah, I guess you just
have to sell yourself.


1346
01:01:16.275 --> 01:01:18.371
Exactly, that's what Nigel always says.

1347
01:01:18.421 --> 01:01:20.184
Sell, sell, sell.

1348
01:01:20.234 --> 01:01:21.852
I am really looking
forward to meeting him


1349
01:01:21.876 --> 01:01:23.144
at your party tomorrow.

1350
01:01:23.194 --> 01:01:25.422
Yeah it should be a blast.

1351
01:01:25.472 --> 01:01:28.596
I hear he's bringing like 10 girlfriends.

1352
01:01:28.646 --> 01:01:30.321
I thought he wasn't from here?

1353
01:01:30.371 --> 01:01:31.378
Oh he's not.

1354
01:01:31.428 --> 01:01:32.682
But his popularity with the ladies

1355
01:01:32.706 --> 01:01:34.873
stretches from sea to sea.

1356
01:01:36.434 --> 01:01:37.434
Huh.

1357
01:01:38.317 --> 01:01:40.067
Will Javier be there?

1358
01:01:43.931 --> 01:01:46.014
I'm not sure.

1359
01:01:46.901 --> 01:01:49.068
So what's with you guys?

1360
01:01:50.394 --> 01:01:52.187
What do you mean?

1361
01:01:52.237 --> 01:01:56.467
I don't know, I mean
are you like a couple?


1362
01:01:56.517 --> 01:01:59.932
No, I told you, I'm
not looking for anything.


1363
01:01:59.982 --> 01:02:04.804
I know, I know, that's
why I'm asking, obviously.


1364
01:02:04.854 --> 01:02:07.182
He is just someone

1365
01:02:07.232 --> 01:02:09.565
who I have a good time with.

1366
01:02:10.926 --> 01:02:13.259
Well that is, that's nice.

1367
01:02:14.754 --> 01:02:16.421
Yeah it is, it is.

1368
01:02:23.023 --> 01:02:24.365
What are you doing?

1369
01:02:24.415 --> 01:02:28.082
I'm just taking off
my pants, comfortable.


1370
01:02:33.226 --> 01:02:34.226
Mm hmm.

1371
01:02:39.016 --> 01:02:41.386
It's too bad though.

1372
01:02:41.436 --> 01:02:42.603
What's that?

1373
01:02:43.451 --> 01:02:44.897
With Javier.

1374
01:02:44.947 --> 01:02:46.475
I know it wouldn't go anywhere

1375
01:02:46.525 --> 01:02:48.442
even if I wanted it to.

1376
01:02:50.674 --> 01:02:51.674
Why not?

1377
01:02:52.862 --> 01:02:55.594
Well I'm really attracted
to him physically,


1378
01:02:55.644 --> 01:02:57.894
if you know what I mean but

1379
01:02:58.809 --> 01:03:02.059
he's just missing all that other stuff.

1380
01:03:03.300 --> 01:03:04.513
What other stuff?

1381
01:03:04.563 --> 01:03:07.896
I don't know, he doesn't listen to me.

1382
01:03:08.754 --> 01:03:11.254
Well at least not like you do.

1383
01:03:15.455 --> 01:03:17.377
And we don't laugh.

1384
01:03:17.427 --> 01:03:19.624
I mean we do, we do.

1385
01:03:19.674 --> 01:03:21.972
But it's not witty.

1386
01:03:22.022 --> 01:03:24.189
It's just like, dumb shit.

1387
01:03:25.733 --> 01:03:28.916
Well having fun is important.

1388
01:03:28.966 --> 01:03:30.216
It is, it is.

1389
01:03:31.359 --> 01:03:32.860
And doing different things,

1390
01:03:32.910 --> 01:03:35.064
like Javier would never suggest that

1391
01:03:35.114 --> 01:03:38.197
we go to an
art gallery like you did.

1392
01:03:41.231 --> 01:03:42.720
What was that?

1393
01:03:42.770 --> 01:03:43.690
Nothing.

1394
01:03:43.740 --> 01:03:46.990
Oh, I thought I heard breaking glass.

1395
01:04:11.959 --> 01:04:13.591
Hi.

1396
01:04:13.641 --> 01:04:14.718
Hi.

1397
01:04:14.768 --> 01:04:17.941
I'm just setting up the music.

1398
01:04:17.991 --> 01:04:19.408
Are those for me?

1399
01:04:20.485 --> 01:04:22.535
Happy birthday.

1400
01:04:22.585 --> 01:04:23.585
Thanks.

1401
01:04:28.791 --> 01:04:30.458
Where is everyone?

1402
01:04:31.416 --> 01:04:35.368
Oh, there's a couple
of girls in the bathroom.


1403
01:04:35.418 --> 01:04:40.001
I don't know them, and Nigel
should be here any second.


1404
01:04:40.843 --> 01:04:44.603
We were planning a really small gathering.

1405
01:04:44.653 --> 01:04:46.736
You could of fooled me.

1406
01:04:48.705 --> 01:04:50.066
It was the only
day Nigel had to come

1407
01:04:50.090 --> 01:04:53.288
and see the place and he had
business here or something.


1408
01:04:53.338 --> 01:04:54.639
Oh.

1409
01:04:54.689 --> 01:04:57.439
Shouldn't today be all about you?

1410
01:04:58.301 --> 01:05:00.134
I don't mind.

1411
01:05:00.184 --> 01:05:03.453
It's a nice change
from going to a bar.

1412
01:05:03.503 --> 01:05:04.670
Yeah.

1413
01:05:08.186 --> 01:05:09.186
Thanks.

1414
01:05:14.816 --> 01:05:16.983
Well, what do you think?

1415
01:05:20.063 --> 01:05:21.405
Yeah you!

1416
01:05:21.455 --> 01:05:23.288
Do you think it works?

1417
01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:29.440
I think it's perfect.

1418
01:05:29.490 --> 01:05:30.657
Whoa, hey hey.

1419
01:05:31.502 --> 01:05:33.178
I thought you
were gonna put the music on?


1420
01:05:33.202 --> 01:05:34.643
Right.

1421
01:05:34.693 --> 01:05:36.276
Okay, drink time!

1422
01:05:38.406 --> 01:05:39.406
Woo!

1423
01:05:45.788 --> 01:05:47.371
You want a drink.

1424
01:05:53.691 --> 01:05:55.524
Monday is my birthday.

1425
01:05:58.008 --> 01:05:59.841
Tuesday is happy hour.

1426
01:06:03.130 --> 01:06:07.130
And Wednesday is when the
monsters come to play.


1427
01:06:12.104 --> 01:06:13.303
Toast!

1428
01:06:13.353 --> 01:06:16.603
Okay, for the birthday girl, Melissa.

1429
01:06:17.801 --> 01:06:19.801
We just met, but you are

1430
01:06:21.195 --> 01:06:24.445
the most beautiful girl I've ever seen.

1431
01:06:25.835 --> 01:06:27.190
I will drink to that.

1432
01:06:27.240 --> 01:06:28.789
So sweet.

1433
01:06:28.839 --> 01:06:30.506
I love this place!

1434
01:06:32.737 --> 01:06:33.994
It's perfect!

1435
01:06:34.044 --> 01:06:35.444
We can do this!

1436
01:06:35.494 --> 01:06:36.586
It's only listed for 2.2,

1437
01:06:36.636 --> 01:06:38.197
I can get it for two million.

1438
01:06:38.247 --> 01:06:39.247
Gut reno!

1439
01:06:40.638 --> 01:06:42.129
This is gonna be the most

1440
01:06:42.179 --> 01:06:44.144
amazing nightclub ever!

1441
01:06:44.194 --> 01:06:46.214
I will put a water slide over there.

1442
01:06:46.264 --> 01:06:47.825
I will put mirrors on the ceiling,

1443
01:06:47.875 --> 01:06:49.944
maybe I will put
some dancers in a cage.

1444
01:06:49.994 --> 01:06:52.188
No I'll put some panthers in a cage.

1445
01:06:52.238 --> 01:06:53.207
I can do whatever I want,

1446
01:06:53.257 --> 01:06:54.727
I will break all the rules

1447
01:06:54.777 --> 01:06:56.360
because I am Nigel.

1448
01:07:00.519 --> 01:07:03.614
Fireworks for my baby sisters birthday!

1449
01:07:03.664 --> 01:07:04.664
Hi.

1450
01:07:06.535 --> 01:07:08.692
Thanks for organizing this.

1451
01:07:08.742 --> 01:07:09.764
This is my friend John.

1452
01:07:09.814 --> 01:07:11.024
Hey, nice to meet you.

1453
01:07:11.074 --> 01:07:12.781
Yeah, you too.

1454
01:07:12.831 --> 01:07:15.811
I just dropped a giant dupe, you?

1455
01:07:15.861 --> 01:07:19.407
No, no, no, no, I take
all my dumps at home.


1456
01:07:19.457 --> 01:07:22.856
No, dude, I just smoked
a horrifically fat dupe.


1457
01:07:22.906 --> 01:07:24.376
I'll cut you in on the next one.

1458
01:07:24.426 --> 01:07:26.477
Let's get some real
dancing going on in here!


1459
01:07:26.527 --> 01:07:28.777
Vanessa switch up the song.

1460
01:07:30.471 --> 01:07:32.804
I wanna see some creativity.

1461
01:07:37.702 --> 01:07:38.787
Yes!

1462
01:07:38.837 --> 01:07:40.720
That is more like it!

1463
01:07:40.770 --> 01:07:42.329
Yeah, really feel it.

1464
01:07:42.379 --> 01:07:44.283
Really use the space.

1465
01:07:44.333 --> 01:07:45.416
Yeah, sure.

Man the party never
stops with those girls.


1500
01:11:30.249 --> 01:11:31.249
Yeah.

1501
01:11:33.930 --> 01:11:35.388
What's up out here?

1502
01:11:35.438 --> 01:11:38.521
Awe nothing, just clearing my head.

1503
01:11:39.455 --> 01:11:41.351
I once went to a
silent meditation retreat


1504
01:11:41.401 --> 01:11:42.638
for three whole weeks,

1505
01:11:42.688 --> 01:11:44.271
did not say a word.

1506
01:11:46.168 --> 01:11:47.251
Wow.

1507
01:11:47.301 --> 01:11:50.145
Yeah, the toilet broke after three days.

1508
01:11:50.195 --> 01:11:54.278
Nobody could tell maintenance,
it was disgusting.


1509
01:11:55.738 --> 01:11:56.963
You sure you're not hiding out here

1510
01:11:56.987 --> 01:11:59.154
from something or someone?

1511
01:12:00.583 --> 01:12:02.166
What do you mean?

1512
01:12:06.584 --> 01:12:10.203
I see the way you
look at my sister eh?

1513
01:12:10.253 --> 01:12:11.201
Trust me,

1514
01:12:11.251 --> 01:12:13.451
we are just friends.

1515
01:12:13.501 --> 01:12:17.659
She told me you're her best friend here.

1516
01:12:17.709 --> 01:12:19.029
Really?

1517
01:12:19.079 --> 01:12:21.746
Vanessa, she actually said that?

1518
01:12:21.796 --> 01:12:22.796
Yup.

1519
01:12:24.115 --> 01:12:25.115
Wow.

1520
01:12:27.232 --> 01:12:29.781
Well listen man, John.

1521
01:12:29.831 --> 01:12:32.449
I really appreciate you
being here for Vanessa.


1522
01:12:32.499 --> 01:12:35.317
You know, in dealing with
it's been pretty tough on her.


1523
01:12:35.367 --> 01:12:37.653
Dealing with what?

1524
01:12:37.703 --> 01:12:39.153
You don't know.

1525
01:12:39.203 --> 01:12:40.000
I don't know what?

1526
01:12:40.050 --> 01:12:41.217
Awe Vanessa!

1527
01:12:43.213 --> 01:12:45.673
I tell her she's gotta include people

1528
01:12:45.723 --> 01:12:46.723
and then...

1529
01:12:49.403 --> 01:12:50.456
She just hides it.

1530
01:12:50.506 --> 01:12:52.209
Wait, wait, wait, she's okay right?

1531
01:12:52.259 --> 01:12:53.259
Yeah, now.

1532
01:12:54.855 --> 01:12:57.010
Her firm in BC was a scam.

1533
01:12:57.060 --> 01:12:59.392
She was pretty much the only
one that didn't get charged.


1534
01:12:59.442 --> 01:13:02.259
She didn't know anything about it but

1535
01:13:02.309 --> 01:13:04.492
it's been pretty rough on her.

1536
01:13:04.542 --> 01:13:07.459
Plus her resume's now just useless.

1537
01:13:08.408 --> 01:13:12.291
But she scored that sweet
gig out here didn't she?


1538
01:13:12.341 --> 01:13:16.313
I guess that's what
she's telling people.


1539
01:13:16.363 --> 01:13:17.363
Oh my god.

1540
01:13:19.226 --> 01:13:21.687
I thought she had it all together.

1541
01:13:21.737 --> 01:13:24.320
Oh she does, where it counts.

1542
01:13:25.781 --> 01:13:27.031
Unbelievable.

1543
01:13:31.059 --> 01:13:31.842
Wow.

1544
01:13:31.892 --> 01:13:32.975
John, John.

1545
01:13:35.177 --> 01:13:37.619
I'm really glad that there's

1546
01:13:37.669 --> 01:13:40.204
someone like you for Vanessa to lean on.

1547
01:13:40.254 --> 01:13:43.421
You know, when I'm not around anymore.

1548
01:13:44.527 --> 01:13:46.360
Where are you going?

1549
01:13:48.225 --> 01:13:51.670
I never wanted to be a consultant.

1550
01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:52.616
I said it.

1551
01:13:52.666 --> 01:13:54.963
I never wanted to be a consultant.

1552
01:13:55.013 --> 01:13:57.341
Okay, what did you want to be Nigel?

1553
01:13:57.391 --> 01:13:59.138
I wanted to be an activist.

1554
01:13:59.188 --> 01:14:00.413
Really?

1555
01:14:00.463 --> 01:14:02.024
What kind of activist?

1556
01:14:02.074 --> 01:14:02.857
What?

1557
01:14:02.907 --> 01:14:04.821
I don't remember.

1558
01:14:04.871 --> 01:14:05.910
But now here I am.

1559
01:14:05.960 --> 01:14:08.838
Here I am making so much money.

1560
01:14:08.888 --> 01:14:10.159
So much money.

1561
01:14:10.209 --> 01:14:11.683
Guess how much money I make.

1562
01:14:11.733 --> 01:14:12.516
I really don't...

1563
01:14:12.566 --> 01:14:13.349
No guess.

1564
01:14:13.399 --> 01:14:14.567
Come on just guess!

1565
01:14:14.617 --> 01:14:15.400
Say a number!

1566
01:14:15.450 --> 01:14:16.640
Don't low ball.

1567
01:14:16.690 --> 01:14:17.473
100,000.

1568
01:14:17.523 --> 01:14:18.585
No, wrong!

1569
01:14:18.635 --> 01:14:20.218
$275,000 last year.

1570
01:14:23.373 --> 01:14:24.252
Wow.

1571
01:14:24.302 --> 01:14:25.302
Wow.

1572
01:14:26.391 --> 01:14:28.387
And you know what else?

1573
01:14:28.437 --> 01:14:29.854
No, no I don't.

1574
01:14:33.003 --> 01:14:34.170
I'm unhappy.

1575
01:14:35.107 --> 01:14:36.580
Ha!

1576
01:14:36.630 --> 01:14:38.880
I am deeply deeply unhappy.

1577
01:14:41.528 --> 01:14:43.278
Sorry to hear that.

1578
01:14:46.965 --> 01:14:50.632
It's okay, because
tonight the pain stops.


1579
01:14:52.982 --> 01:14:54.645
I don't follow ya.

1580
01:14:54.695 --> 01:14:56.548
Before I walked in here,

1581
01:14:56.598 --> 01:14:59.472
downed a whole container of meds.

1582
01:14:59.522 --> 01:15:01.157
No, no Nigel, that's not good.

1583
01:15:01.207 --> 01:15:02.506
No, it is too late man!

1584
01:15:02.556 --> 01:15:04.088
No, no Vanessa!

1585
01:15:05.148 --> 01:15:06.435
Oh god, oh god, feel that.

1586
01:15:06.485 --> 01:15:08.596
We gotta get you
to a hospital, come on.

1587
01:15:10.618 --> 01:15:11.618
Vanessa!

1588
01:15:12.591 --> 01:15:13.530
Oh my god.

1589
01:15:13.580 --> 01:15:15.371
Why did I have
all you can eat earlier?

1590
01:15:15.421 --> 01:15:16.803
Oh, that stinks!

1591
01:15:16.853 --> 01:15:17.803
I think it's good.

1592
01:15:17.853 --> 01:15:19.342
Oh no, here we go again.

1593
01:15:20.366 --> 01:15:21.766
Oh god.

1594
01:15:21.816 --> 01:15:22.599
Let it out.

1595
01:15:22.649 --> 01:15:23.881
Let it out.

1596
01:15:23.931 --> 01:15:25.637
Somebody call 9-1-1!

1597
01:15:25.687 --> 01:15:26.839
We gotta get you going.

1598
01:15:26.889 --> 01:15:27.889
Oh my god.

1599
01:15:31.861 --> 01:15:32.972
Nigel, just...

1600
01:15:33.022 --> 01:15:34.232
No, just stay stay stay.

1601
01:15:34.282 --> 01:15:35.740
I gotta tell you something.

1602
01:15:35.790 --> 01:15:36.790
What?

1603
01:15:37.635 --> 01:15:38.802
Just listen.

1604
01:15:40.751 --> 01:15:41.671
Don't do it.

1605
01:15:41.721 --> 01:15:42.721
Not on me.

1606
01:15:46.578 --> 01:15:48.495
You seize the moment.

1607
01:16:03.661 --> 01:16:06.569
Didn't I tell you, this
was all gonna end in tears?


1608
01:16:06.619 --> 01:16:08.874
Didn't I say that?

1609
01:16:08.924 --> 01:16:10.959
What else could I have done?

1610
01:16:11.009 --> 01:16:13.801
You should of cut and
run from the beginning.


1611
01:16:13.851 --> 01:16:15.957
But I never wanted to.

1612
01:16:16.007 --> 01:16:18.517
What are you gonna do now?

1613
01:16:18.567 --> 01:16:20.567
I still don't want to.

1614
01:16:36.483 --> 01:16:37.816
So how ya doing?

1615
01:16:38.651 --> 01:16:42.761
Long day at the hospital
is pretty draining.


1616
01:16:42.811 --> 01:16:43.811
I bet.

1617
01:16:45.042 --> 01:16:46.513
Yeah.

1618
01:16:46.563 --> 01:16:48.396
Let's come sit, relax.

1619
01:16:50.467 --> 01:16:51.720
Coffee?

1620
01:16:51.770 --> 01:16:53.020
Yeah, thanks.

1621
01:17:01.155 --> 01:17:03.061
You've had a big day too.

1622
01:17:03.111 --> 01:17:05.888
How was your first day at the office?

1623
01:17:05.938 --> 01:17:07.206
It was fine.

1624
01:17:07.256 --> 01:17:08.993
I mean it's an office job.

1625
01:17:09.043 --> 01:17:10.918
Everyone has one.

1626
01:17:10.968 --> 01:17:11.968
That's it?

1627
01:17:14.711 --> 01:17:15.711
Yeah.

1628
01:17:16.478 --> 01:17:18.025
Forget about that.

1629
01:17:18.075 --> 01:17:19.747
Sit, please.

1630
01:17:19.797 --> 01:17:20.797
Honestly.

1631
01:17:23.409 --> 01:17:24.659
So how's Nigel?

1632
01:17:25.785 --> 01:17:27.769
He's gonna be okay.

1633
01:17:27.819 --> 01:17:28.987
Good.

1634
01:17:29.037 --> 01:17:30.870
That's really good.

1635
01:17:30.920 --> 01:17:32.799
Yeah, they have him
hooked up on an IV,

1636
01:17:32.849 --> 01:17:35.151
they said his fluids
were all out of whack.


1637
01:17:35.201 --> 01:17:38.310
He just needed time to level out.

1638
01:17:38.360 --> 01:17:40.371
Wow, you were definitely
right about him.


1639
01:17:40.421 --> 01:17:41.504
He is unique.

1640
01:17:43.046 --> 01:17:45.896
That guy is the real deal.

1641
01:17:45.946 --> 01:17:49.238
It's not the first time
this has happened either.


1642
01:17:49.288 --> 01:17:53.189
What can I say, I have
an interesting family.


1643
01:17:53.239 --> 01:17:54.239
I know.

1644
01:17:57.674 --> 01:18:00.424
Nigel told me that he told you.

1645
01:18:02.530 --> 01:18:03.863
I feel terrible.

1646
01:18:05.836 --> 01:18:07.836
Why did you lie to me?

1647
01:18:08.930 --> 01:18:10.439
Does it matter?

1648
01:18:10.489 --> 01:18:11.489
Yes.

1649
01:18:12.925 --> 01:18:13.947
You were the girl who was supposed

1650
01:18:13.971 --> 01:18:16.123
to be too good for me.

1651
01:18:16.173 --> 01:18:18.214
The one who elevated me.

1652
01:18:18.264 --> 01:18:21.357
I'm sorry, but that's a
lot for one person to carry.


1653
01:18:21.407 --> 01:18:25.622
And now I find out you're just
a regular asshole like me.


1654
01:18:25.672 --> 01:18:26.639
Did it ever occur to you John

1655
01:18:26.689 --> 01:18:28.754
that we're all just
regular assholes like you?


1656
01:18:28.804 --> 01:18:30.746
No, no, no, no, no, don't say that.

1657
01:18:30.796 --> 01:18:32.501
Why not, it's true?

1658
01:18:32.551 --> 01:18:35.571
Because, if this,
what I am what I'm doing


1659
01:18:35.621 --> 01:18:38.121
is already it, if I've arrived,

1660
01:18:38.171 --> 01:18:39.861
I don't wanna know.

1661
01:18:39.911 --> 01:18:42.066
What was I supposed to do here?

1662
01:18:42.116 --> 01:18:44.418
I needed to get away from everything.

1663
01:18:44.468 --> 01:18:45.706
Just tell the truth.

1664
01:18:45.756 --> 01:18:47.155
Yeah well you wouldn't of liked me then.

1665
01:18:47.179 --> 01:18:48.199
What difference does it make?

1666
01:18:48.223 --> 01:18:49.244
You've never liked me.

1667
01:18:49.294 --> 01:18:50.627
I kind of did.

1668
01:18:52.863 --> 01:18:54.086
Kind of?

1669
01:18:54.136 --> 01:18:56.750
Yeah, I kind of did.

1670
01:18:56.800 --> 01:18:58.883
And then I really didn't.

1671
01:19:00.327 --> 01:19:02.577
And then I kinda did again.

1672
01:19:03.852 --> 01:19:05.685
And then I really did.

1673
01:19:07.332 --> 01:19:08.332
Really?

1674
01:19:09.988 --> 01:19:10.988
Really.

1675
01:19:12.424 --> 01:19:14.545
More than Javier?

1676
01:19:14.595 --> 01:19:16.098
Javier's just someone who I...

1677
01:19:16.148 --> 01:19:18.025
Okay, no, that's enough, that's enough.

1678
01:19:18.075 --> 01:19:20.242
I will take that as a yes.

1679
01:19:24.704 --> 01:19:25.871
It is a yes.

1680
01:19:55.096 --> 01:19:56.096
Wow.

1681
01:20:00.290 --> 01:20:01.290
Now what?

1682
01:20:02.304 --> 01:20:04.387
And now I'm going away.

1683
01:20:05.882 --> 01:20:08.139
You're, you're what?

1684
01:20:08.189 --> 01:20:11.696
I gotta get out of here
for a bit, I'm gonna travel.


1685
01:20:11.746 --> 01:20:13.085
Where?

1686
01:20:13.135 --> 01:20:15.679
Nigel and I are going
to England on the weekend.


1687
01:20:15.729 --> 01:20:16.912
He has meetings there next week

1688
01:20:16.936 --> 01:20:18.502
and I'm just gonna hang out there

1689
01:20:18.552 --> 01:20:19.969
and then explore.

1690
01:20:21.472 --> 01:20:23.046
Vanessa you're not,

1691
01:20:23.096 --> 01:20:25.625
you're not just graduating high school.

1692
01:20:25.675 --> 01:20:26.864
This isn't the time
in your life where you

1693
01:20:26.888 --> 01:20:28.958
go to Africa for
a year to find yourself.

1694
01:20:29.008 --> 01:20:29.791
Maybe it is.

1695
01:20:29.841 --> 01:20:30.963
No.

1696
01:20:31.013 --> 01:20:32.176
No this is the time in your life

1697
01:20:32.200 --> 01:20:35.455
when you realize you
like me more than Javier.


1698
01:20:35.505 --> 01:20:36.762
Well I guess it's gonna be the time

1699
01:20:36.786 --> 01:20:38.039
for both those things.

1700
01:20:38.089 --> 01:20:40.139
Yeah but that feeling

1701
01:20:40.189 --> 01:20:42.331
might not make it a year.

1702
01:20:42.381 --> 01:20:44.624
Yeah, same goes for you.

1703
01:20:44.674 --> 01:20:48.046
I guess I'm worried about that too.

1704
01:20:48.096 --> 01:20:49.096
I just,

1705
01:20:49.821 --> 01:20:53.349
god I've never been in
this situation before.


1706
01:20:53.399 --> 01:20:55.354
And you're doing great John.

1707
01:20:55.404 --> 01:20:56.904
You don't need me.

1708
01:20:58.084 --> 01:21:00.834
Need has nothing to do with it.

1709
01:21:02.813 --> 01:21:06.813
Maybe I'll come back
to Toronto at some point.


1710
01:21:08.033 --> 01:21:10.033
And we'll keep in touch.

1711
01:21:11.586 --> 01:21:13.520
That's what I should of done.

1712
01:21:13.570 --> 01:21:14.570
What?

1713
01:21:15.368 --> 01:21:16.898
When you were in your underwear

1714
01:21:16.948 --> 01:21:19.971
talking about Javier on the phone.

1715
01:21:20.021 --> 01:21:23.188
I should of made
you do it over Skype.

1716
01:21:27.387 --> 01:21:30.676
Maybe I'll only be gone a couple months

1717
01:21:30.726 --> 01:21:33.808
and then we'll just see where we're at.

1718
01:21:33.858 --> 01:21:35.191
It'll kill me.

1719
01:21:37.016 --> 01:21:39.245
For like a day or two.

1720
01:21:39.295 --> 01:21:40.463
And then I'll be over there

1721
01:21:40.513 --> 01:21:41.631
and I'll be on some news site

1722
01:21:41.655 --> 01:21:44.886
and I'll see the headline,
John Lives Again.


1723
01:21:44.936 --> 01:21:45.999
And they'll be reporting that you've

1724
01:21:46.023 --> 01:21:47.927
become a new man.

1725
01:21:47.977 --> 01:21:51.117
Maybe because of you
that's already happened.


1726
01:21:51.167 --> 01:21:54.084
Yeah well look at me, I'm a mess.

1727
01:21:54.982 --> 01:21:56.660
Unemployed girl on the run with a brother

1728
01:21:56.710 --> 01:22:00.460
who gets his stomach
pumped every six months.


1729
01:22:01.930 --> 01:22:04.263
When I first saw you, you,

1730
01:22:05.642 --> 01:22:09.057
you seemed like the most
put together girl ever.


1731
01:22:09.107 --> 01:22:12.774
Well it's a tough
act, I'll tell you that.


1732
01:22:15.166 --> 01:22:18.029
Well, I am gonna hold you to your

1733
01:22:18.079 --> 01:22:20.699
promise of naked Skype sessions.

1734
01:22:20.749 --> 01:22:22.582
That never happened.

1735
01:22:25.621 --> 01:22:28.684
But you do promise to email?

1736
01:22:28.734 --> 01:22:31.317
Grab a drink when you get back?

1737
01:22:32.448 --> 01:22:33.448
Promise.

1738
01:22:35.086 --> 01:22:36.086
Okay.

1739
01:22:37.406 --> 01:22:38.989
Well I should go.

1740
01:22:40.916 --> 01:22:42.548
Thanks for the coffee but

1741
01:22:42.598 --> 01:22:43.797
Nigel gets out in the morning

1742
01:22:43.847 --> 01:22:46.190
and he's gonna crash at
my place for a few days


1743
01:22:46.240 --> 01:22:48.580
so I gotta get it ready.

1744
01:22:48.630 --> 01:22:50.630
Yeah, no no of course.

1745
01:22:57.724 --> 01:22:59.832
Say hi to your brother for me.

1746
01:22:59.882 --> 01:23:00.882
Yeah okay.

1747
01:24:02.729 --> 01:24:03.896
It's all back.
