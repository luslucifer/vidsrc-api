-She a snitch, too? -What the fuck you say about my moms?


267
00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:48.260
-去你媽的  -要不是這有警衛
-Fuck you and this bitch. -Talking tough with these guards.


268
00:23:48.430 --> 00:23:50.140
如果在外面我揍扁你
I'm gonna see your bitch-ass on the outside.


269
00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:52.230
-帕爾馬黑鬼  -混蛋
-Bitch-ass Palma Ceia nigger. -Bitch-ass motherfucker.


270
00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:54.560
-奧斯卡  -關你屁事
-Oscar...-Fuck DGF!


271
00:23:54.730 --> 00:23:56.270
-有事嗎  -去你媽的
-Is there a problem in here? -Oh, fuck you!


272
00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:59.320
-有事嗎  -沒事
-Is there a problem here? -No, we good.


273
00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:02.440
現在沒事
Yeah, we good for now.


274
00:24:05.410 --> 00:24:07.530
沒事
Yeah.


275
00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:10.620
你媽的
Yeah, fucked up. . .


276
00:24:11.290 --> 00:24:17.630
冷靜點
Calm down.


277
00:24:17.790 --> 00:24:20.050
奧斯卡
Oscar.


278
00:24:23.050 --> 00:24:25.630
你臉怎么了
What happened to your face?


279
00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:30.010
高脂奶油
Dark butter. . .


280
00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:33.520
她很注意別人說什么
She always listenin'.


281
00:24:33.690 --> 00:24:35.850
她太聰明了
Too damn smart for her own good.


282
00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:39.020
幼兒園的人說  我們可以讓她早點上學
Pre-school said, we should think about starting her in school early. . .


283
00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:41.780
蘇菲婭跟你說了嗎
Phina tell you that?


284
00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:44.700
我們會讓她上私立學校
Yeah, we'll put her in private school.


285
00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:48.490
統一的校服
Uniforms.


286
00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:50.370
那天我看了圣B小學
I was looking at Saint B the other day,


287
00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:52.650
他們那里實行西班牙語
and they got this new thing where they start 'em off speaking Spanish,


288
00:24:52.650 --> 00:24:54.140
和英語雙語教學
then they put them back on English...


289
00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:56.540
我不會再來這里
I'm not coming here anymore.


290
00:24:56.710 --> 00:24:58.920
什么
What?


291
00:24:59.090 --> 00:25:02.170
我不會再來監獄看你
I'm not coming here for these visits anymore.


292
00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:04.130
-這是最后一次  -我知道
-This is my last time. -I know, I know. . .


293
00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:05.880
這也是我最后一次犯事
I know, this is the last time for me, too.


294
00:25:06.050 --> 00:25:07.340
我不會再犯事
I told you that. I ain't going down no more.


295
00:25:07.510 --> 00:25:11.600
你讓蘇菲婭承擔這一切而你卻撒手不管
You wanna keep putting Sophina through this, then you go right ahead, OK?


296
00:25:11.770 --> 00:25:14.730
塔蒂阿娜不該經歷這些  奧斯卡
But Tatiana? That baby doesn't deserve this, Oscar.


297
00:25:14.890 --> 00:25:16.940
她還不懂這些
She's too young to know what's going on.


298
00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:19.100
我想這就是為什么她問我
So I guess that's why she asked me why you love


299
00:25:19.270 --> 00:25:21.610
你寧愿度假也不愿陪她
taking your vacations more than you like being with her.


300
00:25:21.780 --> 00:25:25.490
-她不會這么說  -你是說我騙你咯
-She ain't say that. -Oh, so I'm a liar now.


301
00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:31.780
你跟她說我愛她
Ma, you got to tell her I love her.


302
00:25:31.950 --> 00:25:35.410
-跟她說...-你自己跟她說吧
-Tell her I ...-Tell her yourself.


303
00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:37.540
下次你打電話回家自己跟她說
The next time you call home, you tell her yourself.


304
00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:39.960
或者讓她來這里看你
Or better yet, let her come visit you here.


305
00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:42.250
我
Yeah, but I . . .


306
00:25:45.670 --> 00:25:47.090
她不需要知道
She don't need to be exposed. . .


307
00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:50.180
你已經讓她知道了
You already exposed her. . .


308
00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:53.060
-你已經讓她知道了  -這么說你不管我了
-You already exposed her to this. -So what, you gonna leave me?


309
00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:55.310
你打算又不管我  你是什么媽媽
You gonna leave me again? What kind of mom is you?


310
00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:57.640
你打算把我扔在這里不管
You gonna fuck around and leave me in here?


311
00:25:57.810 --> 00:26:00.810
你從沒要我回去
You ain't never had my fuckin' back anyway.


312
00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:07.360
我一個人在這
I'm in here by myself.


313
00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:13.280
-我愛你  奧斯卡  -你什么也不愛
-I love you, Oscar. -You don't love nothin'.


314
00:26:13.450 --> 00:26:14.700
真的
I do.


315
00:26:14.870 --> 00:26:17.500
我為你禱告
And I'm praying for you.


316
00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:21.750
等你出來時再見
I'll see you when you get home.


317
00:26:23.170 --> 00:26:25.130
等等  抱下我好嗎
Hey Ma, hold up. Let me get a hug, Ma?


318
00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:27.300
格蘭特  回到探訪區
Grant,back to the visiting area.


319
00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:29.130
媽媽  對不起  走開
Hey Ma, I'm sorry! Get the fuck out of here!

Shit, bruh. I didn't think we was ever going to hook up.


326
00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:42.160
-怎么了  -我沒事
-What's good? -I'm smooth.

我有好消息和壞消息
I got good news and bad news, though, my nig.


328
00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:46.380
別跟我說你沒拿貨
Don't tell me you ain't got it.


329
00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:49.510
-賣給了一個白人  -真的  多少錢
-Sold it to a white boy. -For real? For how much?


330
00:27:50.130 --> 00:27:51.840
付了我一千塊
Gave me a rack for it.


331
00:27:52.010 --> 00:27:54.180
我不會出這么高價錢

344
00:29:17.010 --> 00:29:18.430
你買的什么蛋糕

胡蘿卜蛋糕
Carrot cake.


346
00:29:20.350 --> 00:29:21.930
為什么不選冰淇淋的
Why you ain't get ice cream?


347
00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:23.970
又不是你生日
'Cause it ain't your birthday.


348
00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:30.440
如果把你的東西放在我那里就方便多了
You know, it'd be hella easier if you had your stuff at my spot, right?


349
00:29:30.610 --> 00:29:32.980
你為什么不搬過來
Why don't you just move in?

-It's already falling apart. -I can't lose. Undefeated.

爸爸無敵
Daddy's 100 and 0.


370
00:31:37.150 --> 00:31:39.150
大騙子  你這個大騙子
Big, big, big cheater. You're a cheater.


371
00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:40.650
我沒作弊

你怎么知道我作弊
How do you know if I cheated or not?

但是羅斯要照看好幾個孩子

378
00:32:08.770 --> 00:32:13.560
照看六個或七個孩子有區別嗎
But what's the difference between watching six kids or watching seven kids?


379
00:32:23.270 --> 00:32:25.400
(西班牙語)

380

爸爸  你衣服上是什么

爸爸工作時出了點意外

床上那件衣服是給你的
Put a shirt on the bed for you, if you want.

395
00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:10.260
前陣子想掙點錢
Last couple of days, trying to get some money.


396

他們今天告訴你的

兩個星期前的事了

My bad, Phina.


399
00:34:25.110 --> 00:34:27.490
我以為可以要回工作
I thought I was gonna get my job back. . .


400
00:34:27.650 --> 00:34:30.610
你以為生活鬧著玩的嗎
You think life's a fucking joke?


401
00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:32.240
你以為被開除了
You think you're gonna get fired


402
00:34:32.410 --> 00:34:35.040
有人會給你工作嗎
and somebody's gonna give you your job back?


403
00:34:38.830 --> 00:34:42.040
你現在打算怎么辦
What? What game you running now, Osc?


404
00:34:42.210 --> 00:34:44.750
你什么都不是
You ain't shit, you know that?


405
00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:47.710
你對我撒謊  對你自己的女兒撒謊
You lie to me, you lie to your fucking daughter. . .


406
00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:51.510
我不該跟你說的  這樣一切都會照舊
I ain't had to tell your ass nothing. Food on the table, the lights still on.


407
00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:53.140
我應該瞞著你的  你不用知道這些
I could've kept getting it, you wouldn't have known shit.


408
00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:55.390
你打算就這么瞞下去
Oh, so you would've just kept faking?


409
00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:58.980
然后整天在外面混
And been out there bustin' knocks, and doing whatever else,or whoever else. . .


410
00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:00.600
你說你想聽真話
You say you want the truth, right?


411
00:35:00.770 --> 00:35:04.020
你根本不聽我說什么
You ain't even tryin' to hear me. You ain't even trying to hear it.


412
00:35:04.190 --> 00:35:05.570
你根本不聽我說什么
You ain't even listening to me.


413
00:35:05.730 --> 00:35:10.110
因為你瞞了兩個星期  現在被逼入絕境  沒得選擇
Not after you lie for two weeks, get cornered, and don't have a choice.


414
00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:12.910
這不是男子漢的行為
That's some pussy-ass shit.


415
00:35:13.070 --> 00:35:16.080
你今天干什么了
What'd you do today? Huh?


416
00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:19.080
你肯定去賣大麻了
I bet you sold that fucking zip.


417
00:35:19.250 --> 00:35:20.910
我已經不做了
I dumped that shit, Phina.


418
00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:23.710
我正想告訴你
That's what I'm trying to tell you.


419
00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:27.630
我好累
I'm tired.


420
00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:31.510
以為我可以重新來過
Thought I could start over fresh, but. . .


421
00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:34.470
但事情沒這么順利
. . .shit ain't workin' out.


422
00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:49.690
你沒賣大麻又沒找到工作
You threw a whole zip of weed out and you don't got a job?


423
00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:57.910
我真想扇你
I could slap you right now.


424
00:36:05.330 --> 00:36:07.250
你怎么辦
What are you gonna do?


425
00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:11.920
做些合法的事
Something legal.


426
00:36:13.970 --> 00:36:17.300
也許我可以好好的過30天
Maybe if I could just not fuck up for 30 days.


427
00:36:21.350 --> 00:36:24.730
奧普拉不是說養成一種習慣需要30天嗎
That's how long Oprah said it takes to form a habit, right?


428
00:36:30.530 --> 00:36:32.530
看著我
Look at me.


429
00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:37.620
別再讓我一人承擔這些
Don't make me have to go through this shit alone, again.


430
00:36:57.390 --> 00:37:00.220
脫掉  脫掉
Get this off. Take it off.


431
00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:07.190
"吶"和"哈"的發音明顯不同
A distinct difference between "Nah" and "Haa."


432
00:37:07.350 --> 00:37:11.730
對
Yeah.


433
00:37:35.590 --> 00:37:38.300
你們來的剛好
Hey, you guys are just in time!


434
00:37:38.470 --> 00:37:40.010
生日快樂
Happy birthday!


435
00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:41.760
你們給我買了生日蛋糕
Oh, you guys got me a cake, too?


436
00:37:41.930 --> 00:37:45.310
-生日快樂  -謝謝你  孩子
-Yup. Happy birthday. -Thank you, baby.


437

440
00:37:56.950 --> 00:37:58.740
奶奶
Hey Grandma.


441
00:37:58.910 --> 00:38:00.620
什么這么香
What's smelling so good?


442
00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:02.450
奧斯卡
Oh, Osc. . .


443
00:38:02.620 --> 00:38:05.410
你知道我只要兩個  你不用花這么多錢
Baby, you know I only needed two. You didn't have to spend so much money.


444
00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:07.580
媽媽  這個你不用擔心
Mama, you don't gotta worry about that.


445
00:38:07.750 --> 00:38:09.920
-噢  -好吧
-Oh...-OK.


446
00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:14.340
-干嘛呢  -在做壞事
-What's up? -We're up to no good. . .


447
00:38:16.050 --> 00:38:19.430
-你們好嗎  -你好嗎  奧斯卡
-How you guys doing? -How you doin', Oscar?


448
00:38:19.590 --> 00:38:20.970
一切都好嗎  奧斯卡
What's going on, Oscar?


449
00:38:21.140 --> 00:38:22.850
-都挺好的  -真的
-Nothin', hangin' out. -Yeah?


450
00:38:23.010 --> 00:38:25.010
弄點吃的  我餓了
Get some food. I'm hungry.


451
00:38:25.180 --> 00:38:26.350
你拿的什么
Uh-oh, what you got?


452
00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:28.310
給媽媽的卡片
Mom's card.


453
00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:32.110
香蒂讓我替她買張卡片
Tay wanted me to go pick her up one.


454
00:38:32.270 --> 00:38:34.190
-給你  -謝謝
-There you go. -Appreciate that.


455
00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:36.610
她看到這個一定會瘋掉
She's gonna flip out over this one.


456
00:38:36.780 --> 00:38:40.360
-不是吧  -那是香蒂
-Oh, come on, now. -That's Chantay there.


457
00:38:40.530 --> 00:38:45.370
拿東西進來了  把它放在...
We got stuff comin' in. You want to put it in. . .


458
00:38:45.540 --> 00:38:48.960
不能扔掉
You can't dump it!


459
00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:51.790
我這么小的時候她就這樣對我說的
No, that's what she told me when I was this size.


460
00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:53.960
"不能扔掉"
"You can't dump it!"


461
00:38:57.170 --> 00:38:59.550
T  你爸爸像你這么小的時候
You know, T,when your daddy was your size,


462
00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:02.430
他經常跟我和奶奶做這些
just your age, he used to do this with me and grandma.


463
00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:06.890
是的  不過他沒你做的好
Yes, he did, but he didn't do it nearly as well as you're doing it.


464
00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:11.520
沒錯  他洗過的我都得重新洗
No, he did not. I had to re-crack everything he cracked.


465
00:39:13.690 --> 00:39:15.980
蘇菲婭  你們很相愛

你覺得這屆超級碗哪個隊會贏

Coach even has a black wife. I'm going for the Steelers.


474
00:39:39.090 --> 00:39:40.510
你瘋了
You insane!


475
00:39:40.670 --> 00:39:43.180

你不伺候我們

478
00:39:47.810 --> 00:39:49.970
我從沒伺候過你  塞費斯
I didn't serve you your whole life, Cephus.


479
00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:51.430
開飯啦

來段美食舞蹈

塞費斯  剛才是你

那是塞費斯  你知道不是我
That was Cephus,you know that wasn't me. . .


485
00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:20.260
不好意思  達里爾  不好意思
I'm sorry, Daryl. I'm sorry.

謝謝你今晚幫忙
Thanks for your help tonight.


498
00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:12.520
媽媽  你不用謝我
Come on, Mama. You ain't got to thank me.


499
00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:14.850
我本來就不該讓你做這些
I shouldn't even be letting you do this.


500
00:41:15.020 --> 00:41:18.270
沒事  很輕松
Oh, please. It's relaxing.


501
00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:20.650
你愛說什么就說什么
Yeah, if you say so.


502
00:41:20.820 --> 00:41:22.650
我說的
I say so.


503
00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:28.990
你們今晚有什么安排
You guys got plans for the night?


504
00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:31.160
沒什么重要的事
Yeah, nothing major though.


505
00:41:31.330 --> 00:41:34.330
和伙伴們一起進城
Meet up with the fellas, head out to the city.


506
00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:36.870
你們出去玩還是
You guys going out, out? Or. . .


507
00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:39.540
我們會很低調的
I think we're just gonna be low-key.


508
00:41:40.340 --> 00:41:44.210
看完煙花后也許會去逛逛
Catch the fireworks, probably roll around a little bit after that.


509
00:41:44.380 --> 00:41:45.880
逛逛
Roll around?


510
00:41:47.470 --> 00:41:49.260
放心
It's gonna be cool, though.


511
00:41:49.430 --> 00:41:52.720
再說  蘇菲婭明早還得上班
Chill. Plus, Phina's gotta get up and go to work in the morning anyway.


512
00:41:54.890 --> 00:41:56.560
你們會喝酒嗎
You guys gonna be drinking?


513
00:41:56.730 --> 00:41:57.760
媽媽  他們會喝酒
Mama, they gonna be drinking.


514
00:41:57.760 --> 00:42:03.150
我上次喝酒是什么時候都記不起來了
I haven't had a drink since...I can't even remember.


515
00:42:04.650 --> 00:42:07.200
要不你們坐地鐵去吧
Why don't you take the train out there.


516
00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:09.760
這樣你們就可以喝酒
That way you guys can drink and hang out


517
00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:12.160
出去玩也沒什么好擔心的
and not have to worry about anything.


518
00:42:12.330 --> 00:42:14.870
我們去去就回
Nah, I feel like getting over there and getting back.


519
00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:18.330
-不用做地鐵  -坐地鐵還不堵車
-Not waiting on no train. -No traffic, either.


520
00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:21.130
去和回來的路上一定很堵
You know? You know it's gonna be crazy, going and coming back.


521
00:42:23.170 --> 00:42:24.920
我們也許會坐地鐵
Yeah, we might take it.


522
00:42:27.550 --> 00:42:29.970
別讓我老盯著你們
Don't make me follow you guys to make sure.


523
00:42:30.140 --> 00:42:31.930
記得畢業舞會的事嗎
Remember prom?


524
00:42:33.890 --> 00:42:35.810
正想忘記
Trying to forget.


525
00:42:39.790 --> 00:42:43.270
(發短信給克里斯:我們坐地鐵去吧)

526
00:42:51.450 --> 00:42:53.320
走了  我們得走了
We gotta go. We're gonna go, OK?


527
00:42:53.490 --> 00:42:54.950
親愛的  謝謝你
Honey, thank you.


528
00:42:55.830 --> 00:42:57.450
沒事吧
You good?


529
00:42:58.210 --> 00:42:59.870
-我去拿東西  -說再見了嗎
-Let me get my stuff. -Did you say goodbye?


530

還以為她只能在大街上解決
