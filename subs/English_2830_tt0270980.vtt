00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.320
You know, you ever heard
someone say that old expression,


2
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.020
"Everything happens for a reason"?
Well, I don't think that applies to me.


3
00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.820
I mean, I spend every morning
rushing to work


4
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.720
trying to catch the same subway
to the same lousy job.


5
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.120
What's the reason for that?

6
00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.620
See, I'm a researcher for one of the
biggest publishing houses in Chicago,


7
00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.720
but where I really belong is in Creative.

8
00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.320
The problem is, is my boss doesn't
know it yet, so I'm totally frustrated.


9
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.320
While my friend Paul keeps telling me,

10
00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.620
"You gotta be optimistic.
You gotta be positive. "


11
00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.220
You know what?

12
00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.720
Today is gonna be my lucky day.
Today is gonna be my...


13
00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.120
- Hey, look at that, It's your lucky day,
- Did you just see that?


14
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.120
Oh, I've seen it a million times,

15
00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:10.620
- You want it?
- No,


16
00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.220
I don't want it, Go ahead,
You got a new briefcase,


17
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.220
Yeah, maybe its got a name
on it or something,


18
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.720
- Oh, come... What are you, nuts?
- What?


19
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.320
- You're gonna return it?
- Yeah,


20
00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.620
Did you not just say
you needed a new one?


21
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.120
Yeah, when I get my raise,

22
00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.120
Haven't you been working
there for, like, a year?


23
00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.620
I bet Taylor doesn't even know
you work there, I'd be pissed,


24
00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.920
- Are you pissed? I'd be pissed,
- Yeah, I'm-I'm a little pissed,


25
00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.320
You know, come to think of it,
I've never really seen you angry before,


26
00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:36.920
Henderson, you ever
seen Tom really angry?


27
00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.620
- No,
- All right, fine, So I don't get angry,


28
00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.420
What is that, a bad thing?

29
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.120
It's, you know, you keep it bottled up
and then sooner or later,


30
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.220
you come into work and you mow
everyone down with one of those...


31
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.420
- AK-47,
- AK-47, You know, just to impress, uh...


32
00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.320
- Jodie Foster,
- Jodie Foster,


33
00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.620
All right, I'll do it
on your day off, all right?


34
00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:01.220
TouchÃ©, There she is,
It's your Jodie Foster,


35
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.320
Paul, come on, man,

36
00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:03.720
How you ever gonna get
to know her if you just sit there?


37
00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.720
It's Taylor's daughter, man, 
I can't just...

38
00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.220
You can't just what? Huh? Are you
gonna be a loser your whole life? Hmm?


39
00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.720
Just go over there
and talk to her, Go, Go,


40
00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.620
- OK, fine, I'm going, I'm going,
- You're going,


41
00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.620
Excuse me,

42
00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.420
Hi, I'm-

43
00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.220
I
- Oh!

44
00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.220
Uh... I
- He wa-

45
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.720
- What are you doing to my dog?
- Ma'am...


46
00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.620
- Who's taunting my dog?
- No one's taunting your dog, He-


47
00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.620
Um, the-the d
- Um...

48
00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.720
Here, why don't you take my seat? Here,

49
00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:26.820
Great, Now, that's great,

50
00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.520
Two more minutes, and I'm gonna
be closer than you are,


51
00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.220
Look, Opening, Go,

52
00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.320
Just go,

53
00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.620
Go, Go,

54
00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:37.520
It's OK, Go, just go,

55
00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.520
Lake Street.
Lake Street is next.


56
00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.820
You're Tom Stansfield, right?
From Research?


57
00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.820
Yeah, Yeah, Tom, 
Tom Stansfield,

58
00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.120
Stansfield from Research,

59
00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.720
It's a growing sport, you know?

60
00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.220
Paul, there is no way that she thought
that it was a wrestling magazine,


61
00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.820
Oh, come on, Get over it, OK?

62
00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.120
You're a little embarrassed,
It happens, OK?


63
00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.820
Let me tell you something,
If I had a dime for every time


64
00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:17.720
a gay naked magazine fell out of my...
I'm kidding, I'm kidding,


65
00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:18.820
What? Paul!

66
00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:20.620
No, But seriously,
so you're a little humiliated,


67
00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.720
At least now we've established
that she knows who you are, right?


68
00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.820
- I'm gonna have to leave the company,
- No, you're not,


69
00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.120
Oh, God, There she is,

70
00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.320
Oh, and I need to see the proofs
on Thailand immediately,


71
00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.520
All right, What else have we got?

72
00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.920
- Are you Tom?
- Yes,


73
00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.120
- Mr, Taylor wants to see you,
- Oh... OK,


74
00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:45.720
OK,

75
00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:49.320
OK, you see? This is your chance, This
is fate, This is what I'm talking about,


76
00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:52.420
It's about that new opening in Creative
and you're the man for the job,


77
00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.820
You're gonna go in there and you're
gonna pitch him those book ideas,


78
00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.720
No, I just... I'm really not ready,

79
00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:59.020
Let's get to business,
Now we're steppin' up, OK,


80
00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.820
Come on, You're gonna go in there,
you're gonna pitch him an inside curve...


81
00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:02.320
Wait, wait, Where is my blue folder?

82
00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.520
You don't need it, Enough with
the excuses already, Come here,


83
00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.120
- You look good, You feel good?
- I feel like I'm gonna throw up,


84
00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:09.020
Well, that's good,
I want you to use that, OK?


85
00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.220
What is this? This dad's?
It's nice, Now get in there, OK?


86
00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:14.120
- Don't-don't touch my ass,
- What? It was a light spank, It was light,


87
00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:18.620
- Hey, 
- Hey,

88
00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.220
- Uh, do I just go in there?
- Um, no, He's not finished yet,


89
00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.620
- but you can have a seat over there,
- Oh, OK,


90
00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.320
Let me explain something
to you, Henderson,


91
00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:31.820
I did not dislike your ideas,
I found them loathsome,


92
00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.320
I hated them,

93
00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:39.020
- You're dismissed,
- From your office?


94
00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:41.120
Nice try,

95
00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:47.920
- Good luck, You're gonna need it...
- He's ready to see you,


96
00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:49.320
You can come in,

97
00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:52.320
You know what? We should have
never let up after the Revolution!


98
00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.820
Sit down, Sit down, Coffee?

99
00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:58.920
We shouldn't have left you at toehold,
We should have driven you to the sea!


100
00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:05.220
Now... what's this I hear
about you making threats


101
00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:08.420
to spray this place with an AK-47?

102
00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:10.420
What?

103
00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:16.620
Oh, oh, oh, No, That...
I was just making a joke,


104
00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.820
Oh, that's funny to you?
Killing everyone in this office?


105
00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:26.620
No, No, No, no, no, no, The...
Paul said how I never get angry...


106
00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.220
And what about you
making fun of midgets?


107
00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.020
I never made fun of midgets,

108
00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:33.420
You said it'd be fun to date one

109
00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.520
because then you could rest
your beer on her head,


110
00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:37.820
No, No, I never said anything like that,

111
00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:40.720
Apparently Henderson thinks you did,

112
00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:44.120
Now I've got a good sense of humor,
but that's just plain sick,


113
00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:46.920
- But, sir, I didn't say...
- Audrey?


114
00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:50.820
- Which file did I ask you for?
- Uh, the Platt file?


115
00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:54.220
- John Platt, Not Sam Platt,
- I'm sorry, I guess I didn't think that...


116
00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:56.120
That's right, You didn't think,

117
00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:59.220
Now if it's not too much trouble,
if you could fetch me the right file...


118
00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:01.520
- OK,
- And get Tom and me some doughnuts,


119
00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:03.020
OK,

120
00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:07.720
Now... I'm told you've been trying
to schedule a meeting with me


121
00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:11.320
about some ideas, 
What are they?

122
00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:16.320
Oh, uh... yeah, 
I had-l had some ideas,

123
00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:21.520
- Something wrong with the coffee?
- Uh, no, It's fine,


124
00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:24.120
- Why'd you make a face?
- What?


125
00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:27.420
Oh, well... It's-it's a little bitter, but...

126
00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:33.920
- Jesus, Audrey, get in here!
- Sir, really, it's f... It's not a problem,


127
00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:36.720
- I've burped up stuff better than this,
- Sir, it's fine,


128
00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:39.820
- Is something wrong?
- Taste Tom's coffee,


129
00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:42.320
No, really, It's OK,

130
00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:47.620
- How would you rate that?
- Well, it's not that great,


131
00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:53.420
Not that great? I guess so,
Tom thinks it's shit,


132
00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:56.620
Audrey, are you retarded?

133
00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:59.920
It's not a rhetorical question,
Are you retarded?


134
00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:01.020
No, I'm not retarded,

135
00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:05.520
Because a retarded person can make
a cup of coffee, Am I right, Tom?


136
00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:07.920
Oh, I... I don't
-I don't really know much

137
00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:10.620
about the limitations
of the handicapped,


138
00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:15.920
I know of an employment agency that
hires out retarded people for $4 an hour,


139
00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:20.620
So, if making a cup of coffee is too
difficult a task for you, Miss Bennett,


140
00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:23.720
perhaps you'd be good enough to let
me know, and I'll contact this agency


141
00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:27.320
and give a retarded person a job,

142
00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:37.020
- I wasn't too rough on her, was l?
- Well, she is new and all,


143
00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:40.420
Maybe I was out of line, But do you
understand what I'm dealing with?


144
00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:44.220
I mean, here I am trying
to fill a position in Creative,


145
00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:49.020
and I can't seem to find one person
responsible enough to earn my trust,


146
00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:52.420
I sometimes wonder if anyone here
even knows what they're doing,


147
00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:54.220
I can understand how you
could see it that way, sir, but...


148
00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:57.120
So you don't think
I was out of line?

149
00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:03.120
Well, if what you're saying
is that a company


150
00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:06.120
is only as strong as its weakest link,
that makes sense, but...


151
00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:08.420
Exactly, That's exactly right,

152
00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:10.920
A company is only as strong
as its weakest link,


153
00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:12.920
- Yeah...
- Audrey, get in here!


154
00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:14.920
You were right, Tom,
I was too soft on her,


155
00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:16.220
- What? No, 
- Yeah?

156
00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:18.220
Audrey, after talking it over
with Tom here,


157
00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:21.320
I've come to realize that
I'm gonna have to let you go,


158
00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:24.120
- You're firing me?!
- I'm sorry, It's just not working out,


159
00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:26.120
- But, sir, I was suggesting...
- I take my job very seriously,


160
00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:28.420
A chain is only as strong
as its weakest link,


161
00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:31.620
- Right, but there's a whole other side,
- Thanks for the support,


162
00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:33.920
Audrey, empty out your desk
by the end of the day,


163
00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:36.020
- Fine,
- Sir, this... I...


164
00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:37.720
Thanks for straightening me
out there, Tom,


165
00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:40.220
Right, right, But I didn't get to say
what I wanted to say,


166
00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:44.920
Oh, your ideas, of course, Schedule
an appointment with my new secretary,


167
00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:55.320
Tom, Are you OK?

168
00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:58.220
Uh... yeah, sure,

169
00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:00.220
I'm guessing by the way
you look he's on another one


170
00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:01.620
of his rampages this morning,

171
00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:03.920
- Definitely,
- Damn,


172
00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:05.420
I was hoping to catch him
in a good mood,


173
00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:09.620
Yeah, that's, um...
that's probably not gonna happen,


174
00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:12.320
I'm supposed to go to this party tonight,
but my dad's making me housesit


175
00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:14.420
for his stupid bird while
he's away this weekend,


176
00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:17.120
Well, why don't you go in there
and tell him you're not gonna do it?


177
00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:18.920
I can't just...

178
00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:22.220
You can't just what? I mean, live your
own life and have a free weekend?


179
00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:25.220
No, it's not that,

180
00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:29.220
- Wait, it is that,
- Yeah,


181
00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:33.020
- I should just go to that party,
- Yeah, of course,


182
00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:38.620
Well, um... OK, I'm gonna
go back to, uh, work,


183
00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:40.820
OK, sure,

184
00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:44.620
Tom? I know this might seem
a little out of place


185
00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:46.620
because we barely
even know each other,


186
00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:49.320
But, do you have any plans tonight?

187
00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:52.020
(mouths) No, no, no,

188
00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:56.520
- Uh... no, I'm-I'm wide open,
- We won't be home too late,


189
00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:57.820
Hey, it's no problem,

190
00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:00.920
So the party starts at 7,
You could be at my dad's house by 6?


191
00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:02.720
- Sure,
- You sure you're cool with this?


192
00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:05.920
- Are you kidding me?
- Tom, you're such a sweetheart,


193
00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:09.820
Thank you so much,
I'm gonna love you forever for this,


194
00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:14.820
- All right, Yeah, who's the man now?
- See? What'd I tell you?


195
00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:18.720
I'm a lady-killer,

196
00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:25.120
How the hell could he be
so excited about housesitting?


197
00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:29.420
He's nice, Daddy, That's how,
Most guys wouldn't even offer to do that,


198
00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:32.120
I don't know if I want him
around my bird,


199
00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:36.220
Oh, Dad, will you just relax?
It's gonna be fine, I promise, OK?


200
00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:40.020
I'll check in as soon
as I get there, 8:00,

201
00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:43.420
If I sense anything's wrong,
you're coming back here,


202
00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:45.520
OK, OK,

203
00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:35.320
Very good, Right on time,

204
00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:40.320
Oh, sir, Uh... 
Hey, is that a bear trap?

205
00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:44.720
Yes, It's to keep the neighbor's kids
out of my yard,


206
00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:56.720
Sir, I just wanted to let you know
how much I appreciate you...


207
00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:59.420
well... letting tonight happen,

208
00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:05.120
I mean, I know it means a lot to Lisa,
and I think you're doing the right thing,


209
00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:07.620
I don't know what
you're planning, Stansfield,


210
00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:11.220
but you're attitude
is making me very nervous,


211
00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:16.420
- Those socks are clean, right?
- Um...


212
00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:21.520
- You hesitated, Put those on,
- Are you serious?


213
00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:34.420
If you want to watch TV,
the remote's there,


214
00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:37.520
That panel controls the lights,
alarm, skylight, etc,


215
00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:39.220
Yeah, I probably won't
use any of that stuff,


216
00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:42.520
- You know, since the party starts at 7,
- Party?


217
00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:46.320
I made it clear to Lisa you're not
to have any guests in here,


218
00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:49.720
You're the only one
allowed in the house,


219
00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:55.620
- What? Lisa's not here?
- No, Of course not,


220
00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:59.720
Lisa's at the party...

221
00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:03.520
and I'm staying here,

222
00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:07.620
Is this concept too complicated
for you, Stansfield?


223
00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:12.920
Don't touch the furniture,

224
00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:19.120
And this is my bird's room,

225
00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:22.520
He's got his own room?

226
00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:27.220
That's cool,

227
00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:33.420
How's my little boy?

228
00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:38.620
- This is OJ,
- OJ? Like the murderer?


229
00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:43.720
No, Like the football player,
OJ Simpson,


230
00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:47.020
I've set the alarm,
When you hear it go off, feed him,


231
00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:50.920
Aw, What do I feed these little guys?

232
00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:57.020
They don't get fed, They are the food,
His diet varies, but they're his favorites,


233
00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:59.720
Hey, don't you have to shut these doors?

234
00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:03.420
Not anymore, He's been depressed
since his mate died,


235
00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:07.520
He won't fly, Just sits in his cage,

236
00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:15.220
Medication, Give him two
of these at 1 0:00,


237
00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:17.420
I have to shove these down his throat?

238
00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:21.120
Just one, The other is inserted
into his rectum,


239
00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:23.220
Don't worry, It's not
too unpleasant for him,


240
00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:28.520
- He doesn't bite, does he?
- No, Not unless you taunt him,


241
00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:30.020
You're not planning on taunting him,
are you, Tom?


242
00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:31.620
- No,
- I mean, that'd be really sick,


243
00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:34.020
No, of course not,

244
00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:38.220
And the most important thing,
make sure he gets a pint of water,


245
00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:40.620
The medication tends to dry him out
and then he can't breathe,


246
00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:42.920
- OK,
- Well, I must be off,


247
00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:46.120
- Henderson should be waiting outside,
- Henderson? I thought you fired him,


248
00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:48.220
Because his ideas were stupid?
Of course not,


249
00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:50.220
He's gonna drive me to the train station,

250
00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:53.920
So, you can leave as soon
as Lisa and Hans get back,


251
00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:56.320
- Hans?
- Lisa's boyfriend,


252
00:15:57.220 --> 00:16:01.520
So remember, uh... water in the bowl,
medication, and...


253
00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:05.720
anything happens to this house
while I'm gone, I'll kill you,


254
00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:12.420
You're housesitting?
You gotta be kidding me.


255
00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:13.620
I know, it sucks,

256
00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:16.620
What are you talking about?
Don't you see? This is a test.


257
00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:19.020
You watch Taylor's house,
come up with a couple of great ideas


258
00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:21.020
and if everything goes smooth,
you get the promotion.


259
00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:24.120
- You think so?
- Of course I do. What could be easier?


260
00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:44.020
What are you doing, Hans?
Come here.


261
00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:48.620
Baby, you're gonna burn so bad if you
don't let me put this on you right now.


262
00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:58.420
Oh, my God. You scared me, Hans.
You're insane. Put that down.


263
00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:03.720
Want to put some on me?
Put some lotion on me.


264
00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:14.220
- Is Jack around?
- Hey... what? Who are you?


265
00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:18.320
It's OK, I'm Red Taylor, I'm Jack's son,
I let myself in the back,


266
00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:20.420
- Oh, Hey, Tom Stansfield,
- Hey,


267
00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:24.020
Tom, nice to meet you,
Am I interrupting something here?


268
00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:29.320
Oh, no, Uh... I was... uh...
Oh, your shoes,


269
00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:33.620
Nike, Uh, listen, Tom, can you
do me a favor? I lost my TV Guide.


270
00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:37.720
I came over here to see if maybe
my dad's got a copy of one,


271
00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:40.320
You haven't seen a copy of
the guide laying around, have you?


272
00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:43.120
- My sister in?
- No, actually she's out for the evening,


273
00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:46.720
- Bingo, 
- Oh,

274
00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:50.520
So, uh, you're here to...

275
00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:53.420
- Housesit, 
- Oh,

276
00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:59.120
Yeah, it's probably for the best if you
don't, uh, tell Lisa that I stopped by,


277
00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:03.320
- Why? Is there a problem?
- Well, you know how uptight she is,


278
00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:06.420
- Really?
- I'm more the free spirit of the family,


279
00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:12.220
Oh, Oh, boy, See that right there?

280
00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:15.320
- Kirstie Alley?
- Yeah, I dated her maid,


281
00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:19.420
- Really?
- I boned Kirstie Alley's maid,


282
00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:22.320
And this is while they were
making Look Who's Talking ,


283
00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:24.220
Wow, that's really something,

284
00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:27.120
I'll tell you another thing,
You know Michelle Pfeiffer?


285
00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:28.220
Yeah,

286
00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:31.320
I did the deed
with Michelle Pfeiffer's cousin,


287
00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:33.420
- Wow,
- Right out there in those bushes,


288
00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:35.820
- Right,
- Ah, she looked just like Michelle, too,


289
00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:37.920
except she was brunette
instead of blond,


290
00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:40.420
and she was kinda short and dumpy,

291
00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:44.020
Well, uh, ya certainly have
an interesting life, Fred,


292
00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:46.220
You married, Tom?

293
00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:48.920
- No, I'm single,
- No girlfriend?


294
00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:52.920
No, and, no, actually I had a girlfriend,
but we, uh, broke up,


295
00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:58.520
Listen, I really gotta get back to work,
and since you got your TV Guide and...


296
00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:03.020
So, you broke up, huh? 
That's too bad,

297
00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:04.820
- Was your ex a looker?
- Yeah,


298
00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:07.020
Yeah, in my opinion she was,

299
00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:11.520
I bet you you still keep a picture
of her in your wallet,


300
00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:14.220
- Yeah, I do,
- Can I see it?


301
00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:15.920
- Yeah, I suppose,
- OK,


302
00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:18.820
Let me find her
in here, There she is,

303
00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:22.820
Tom, you lucky man!

304
00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:26.120
- Yeah,
- Oh, she is a real piece of ass!


305
00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:29.620
Oh, I could knock on that back door
all day long!


306
00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:32.220
- Yeah? Sh-she's a pretty girl,
- Wow,


307
00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:35.220
She has gotta be wicked in bed,
Tell me she's wicked in bed, Tom,


308
00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:37.520
I bet you she banged your johnson raw
every single night,


309
00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:39.320
- OK...
- ...'cause that is one fine-looking broad,


310
00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:41.020
All right, Hey! Would ya-

311
00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:44.520
I me
- You're talking about my girlfriend,

312
00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:48.120
- Ex-girlfriend, you said,
- Yeah, but still, it's...


313
00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:51.620
Come on, I'm just making conversation,
You know, guy-talk,


314
00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:54.320
Look, I just... 
I don't tell comfortable

315
00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:58.120
talking about my intimate relationships
with a complete stranger,


316
00:19:58.220 --> 00:20:00.320
Understood,

317
00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:03.720
Well, you know, given how uptight
you are talking about sex,


318
00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:05.520
you pretty much
answered the question,


319
00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:07.920
I am not uptight! OK?

320
00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:11.220
Just because I don't feel like
revealing personal details


321
00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:15.120
about my ex-girlfriend's sexual habits
does not make me uptight,


322
00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:17.720
I didn't ask you anything personal,

323
00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:20.720
Well, then, what the hell
do you consider personal?


324
00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:24.420
Well, it'd be like, you know,
if I asked you how big your rod was,


325
00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:27.120
Then I would be
out of line, 1 00%,

326
00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:31.820
No, no! That is no worse than
asking me if my girlfriend's a nymph,


327
00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:34.620
I just asked you if she dug sex,

328
00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:37.120
Besides, I wouldn't have asked
if I'd known she was frigid,


329
00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:39.720
Yeah, well, she is not frigid!

330
00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:41.720
Are you leaving?

331
00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:43.220
Oh, yeah,

332
00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:45.420
And listen, Could you do me a favor?

333
00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:47.020
- It's no big deal,
- What?


334
00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:50.720
A business associate of my dad's
is gonna come by to pick this up,


335
00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:55.920
- It's frozen steaks, it's a gift,
- It's not cold,


336
00:20:57.420 --> 00:21:00.620
Dad says that's the way the guy
likes 'em, What are you gonna do?


337
00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:02.520
Will you give it to him?

338
00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:06.820
Just one second,

339
00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:14.920
- Audrey, 
- Tom,

340
00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:16.420
Let's go! Come on!

341
00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:19.520
Oh, I guess this makes sense,
He's got you living with him now?


342
00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:21.920
Uh, no, I'm just watching his place,

343
00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:24.720
- He's... Jack's out of town,
- He is?


344
00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:27.520
- Yeah,
- Aw, shoot!


345
00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:30.020
I came by 'cause I was
hoping to get my job back,


346
00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:31.720
You know, the one that
you got me canned from


347
00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:33.420
'cause I made a bad cup
of coffee? Remember that?


348
00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:34.720
Listen, I'm really sorry about that,

349
00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:37.120
How can you fire someone
for making a bad cup of coffee, huh?


350
00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:38.520
I know, That's what I
tried to say to him,

351
00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:41.920
I mean, who do you think you are -
Juan fucking Valdez?


352
00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:44.220
I might have had a future at that place
if you'd just give me half a chance,


353
00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:49.220
- Let's get a move on, saddlebag!
- Oh, my God, That's my idiot boyfriend,


354
00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:53.220
Hold your pants, you freakin' psycho!

355
00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:55.720
God, He drives me crazy,

356
00:21:55.820 --> 00:21:59.020
Oh, hey, you know, since you're on the
rug, would you mind putting these on?


357
00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:03.120
- They're medical... I got 'em on, too,
- Licorice,


358
00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:06.520
I hate licorice, I need water
or I'm gonna throw up, Ugh!


359
00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:10.520
Thanks to you, I lost my second job
inside a month and now I'm flat broke,


360
00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:11.920
You lost another job?

361
00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:14.720
Yeah, I got fired from my waitress job
just last Friday,


362
00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:17.520
- Why did they fire you?
- Oh, I don't know,


363
00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:20.120
One of the assistant managers
caught me making out with a customer,


364
00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:21.820
- Excuse me?
- Well, I mean, actually the customer


365
00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:23.320
was my boyfriend,

366
00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:25.820
I mean, he became my boyfriend
after the incident anyway,


367
00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:28.720
- You got any beer in here?
- Hey,


368
00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:31.220
- Here we go,
- Would you mind putting these on?


369
00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:34.520
It's a house rule, Oh, actually,
that's a twist...!


370
00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:39.320
That's the counter, Listen, Jack,
is just a real stickler, That'd be great,


371
00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:41.820
No kidding, I found that out this morning,

372
00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:43.520
I swear I am gonna freak out
and I'm gonna come in there...


373
00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:45.620
Oh, man, Spike's in a real mood,

374
00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:47.020
Don't even... hey,

375
00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:48.920
- Come on, come on, come on, Shit,
- I swear to God, Audrey,


376
00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:51.720
I'll piss on this guy's front steps!
Let's go!


377
00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:56.020
If you don't open this door this second,
I'm gonna come in there and...


378
00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:57.120
- Hi

379
00:22:57.220 --> 00:22:58.520
Don't worry, Nothing broke,

380
00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:02.720
Hey, Baby, come on, What are you
doing leaving me in the goddamn car?


381
00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:04.320
Shake that tail, baby,
Come on, Let's get a move on,


382
00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:08.220
- Hold your horses, Try acting civilized,
- Audrey!


383
00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:09.520
This is Tom, the guy that I was
telling you about from the office,


384
00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:11.520
Oh, the coffee dude,

385
00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:14.420
You got some black ass karma
headed your way, superfreak,


386
00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:17.420
Oh, we don't need no lecture
from you, Mr, High and Mighty,


387
00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:20.720
Hey, shut that sass-trap of yours, little
lady, before I bounce you off the wall!


388
00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:25.120
Look, I would appreciate it
if you would take this outside, please,


389
00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:30.020
Hey, I'd appreciate it if you'd go
and buy yourself a bagel, Jewy,


390
00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:32.820
Jewy? I'm not Jewish, And I don't
think that making fun of the...


391
00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:36.220
- Don't pay attention to him, He's nuts,
- I'm nuts?


392
00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:38.820
- Who do you think you are?
- Look, can we please take this outside?


393
00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:40.320
Oh, come on,

394
00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:43.120
You know what you are?
You're a filthy, little tramp,


395
00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:44.620
Me? What about you and that waitress?

396
00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:46.720
- Keep going,
- I never touched her ever,


397
00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:48.720
- Swear?
- So help me God,


398
00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:50.220
You swear on your mama's life?

399
00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:52.220
Hell, woman, I ain't gonna
swear on my mama's life,


400
00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:55.120
- Why not? If you're telling the truth,
- I think he's telling the truth, Audrey,


401
00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:56.620
Then why won't you swear
on your mama's life?


402
00:23:56.620 --> 00:23:59.320
Well, because I don't feel
like I have the right


403
00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:00.920
to gamble with my mama's life,
that's why,


404
00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:03.320
Gamble? But apparently
you got nothing to worry about


405
00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:05.120
unless you're lying like
a hunk of morgue meat,


406
00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:09.620
Hey, I ain't gonna sit here and get
called a liar by no skankin' whore!


407
00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:12.920
Who you calling a whore,
you shrimp-dick bastard?!


408
00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:14.120
Audrey, see now
you're just provoking him,


409
00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:15.620
That's a vicious, flat-out,
bold-faced lie and you know it!


410
00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:18.920
- Is it? Is it? I don't think so!
- I'll whip it out right now!


411
00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:20.220
- No, no, no, I don't wanna see it,
- I'm gonna whip it out right now


412
00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:22.920
and prove to you
that she's a lying slut!

413
00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:24.820
- Keep your meat in the fridge!
- You wanna see my piece?


414
00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:27.220
- All right, All right! That is enough!
- Go get me a ruler, Tom! You go get...


415
00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:30.820
That is it, I don't care
if you have a tiny shrimp dick!


416
00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:37.020
- Or a giant whale dick, which that's...
- Goddamn it, Audrey!


417
00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:40.020
You tell him you're a liar or I'm gonna
smash your face in, I swear!


418
00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:45.220
- Wait a minute! You put that down!
- All right, Can we please just use fists?


419
00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:48.220
- Come here, you little...
- You hit me, you bastard!


420
00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:50.820
- I did not and you know it!
- He hit me!


421
00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:52.920
He hit me as sure
as I'm standing right here!


422
00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:54.720
- Did you hit her, Spike?
- Yes,


423
00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:56.620
With an open hand,
It was with an open hand,


424
00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:58.020
- So what if it's open?
- You can't...


425
00:24:58.120 --> 00:24:59.520
- Then it don't count,
- Says who?


426
00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:02.520
Says anyone, Ask the Jew,

427
00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:05.020
All right, that's it,
You two have got to leave,


428
00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:07.620
All right, that's fine,
But she is not coming with me,


429
00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:09.020
You are not welcome in the double ride,

430
00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:12.520
Fine, I don't care, I don't need your lousy
trailer, I'll stay right here with Tom,


431
00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:14.220
- Fine, Stay with Tom,
- I'll stay right here,


432
00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:19.920
Wait a minute, Whoa, Guys, you need
to try to work this thing out,


433
00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:23.720
- He hit me! He knocked me on my can!
- I know, I know,


434
00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:28.420
Well, but it was with
an open hand after all, and...


435
00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:32.020
Relationships have their
ups and downs, you guys,


436
00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:33.920
and you don't want to ruin this great...

437
00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:42.420
Oh, God, The bird, OJ!

438
00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:46.820
Oh, my God,

439
00:25:56.520 --> 00:26:01.120
You come back here or Tom's
gonna kick your butt! So take that!


440
00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:04.220
Ooh, I'm shaking
in my boots, baby!


441
00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:06.720
Look at those two, OJ,

442
00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:15.020
Oh, I ain't
running away, dummy!


443
00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:17.320
- Hello?
- Hi, Tom. How are ya?


444
00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:21.220
Hey, Lisa, I'm great, I'm great,

445
00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:23.820
- Is that OJ?
- Yeah, yeah.


446
00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:27.520
- We just had a little drink of water,
- I haven't heard him squawk in years,


447
00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:31.720
Oh, yeah,
He's quite the crazy bird, you know,


448
00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:34.220
Yeah. Anyway, Tom,
I just wanted you to know


449
00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:37.420
how much I appreciate
you helping me out tonight.


450
00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:40.820
But I'd like to crash at a friend's place
tonight after the party,


451
00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:44.120
Would you think it was horrible if I asked
you to stay the whole night tonight?


452
00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:49.620
Oh, well... I-I don't think your dad
would want me staying here,


453
00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:53.520
- Please?
- Yeah, I suppose I could stay,


454
00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:56.120
Thanks, Tom. I really appreciate it.
See you tomorrow.


455
00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:59.420
I ain't afraid of you and Tom
sure as hell ain't scared neither!


456
00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:03.520
Butthead! Loser!

457
00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:10.320
Oh, my God, Thank God he's gone,
Hey, so is it OK if I stay here tonight?


458
00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:14.220
Oh, man, it's... it's not even my house,

459
00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:16.220
Oh, yeah,

460
00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:18.620
OK, Well, I sure as hell
don't want any charity,


461
00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:23.120
I mean, it's not like you
owe me anything, so...


462
00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:25.320
And I'm sorry about
that whole office thing,


463
00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:26.820
I know that you didn't mean
to get me fired,


464
00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:31.820
- Yeah, You didn't deserve to get fired,
- Thanks,


465
00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:33.920
OK,

466
00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:38.120
Well, I guess I'll just go try
to find a homeless shelter then,


467
00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:43.620
- Wait a second,
- Yeah?


468
00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:45.520
God,

469
00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:51.220
- Look, I suppose you can stay,
- Really? Oh! Thanks, Tom,


470
00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:53.320
You're the best, Oh, and I'll
clean up the kitchen, OK?


471
00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:56.420
- OK, 
- OK, OK,

472
00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:13.520
Yeah, One second,

473
00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:16.420
There's somebody at the door,

474
00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:20.120
Hi, can I help you?

475
00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:23.420
Vasquez sent me here
to pick up a package,


476
00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:27.020
Oh, you're the... Yeah, yeah, yeah,
Red told me you might be stopping by,


477
00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:28.820
Uh... Oh, hi, I'm Tom,

478
00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:31.920
What is this, Oprah ?
Just give me the goddamn package,


479
00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:35.720
Oh, OK, Yeah, Um...

480
00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:39.020
I think this is it,

481
00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:41.920
If this ain't kosher,
I'm gonna break his thumbs,


482
00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:45.920
Oh, well, by law, it should be stamped
right on the package there,


483
00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:51.420
What...

484
00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:59.520
Dinnertime, buddy,

485
00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:08.120
OJ... today's specials include
a scrumptious buffet of mice kebabs,


486
00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:11.620
Shit! Ah... crap!

487
00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:16.720
You son of a bitch,

488
00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:18.620
Ha,

489
00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:24.520
I got you now, buddy,

490
00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:37.420
- Dude, that was cool,
- Oh, my God,


491
00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:41.920
Tommy, easy on the antiques,

492
00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:45.720
- Was that an owl?
- Yes, OJ got out, How is he flying?


493
00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:49.120
- Well, he is a bird,
- He... no, Jack said that he...


494
00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:51.220
Aw, shit! I gotta find him,

495
00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:55.020
Don't worry, He'll probably
come back when he's hungry,


496
00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:58.720
No, I have to find him or I'm gonna
lose my job! You know what?


497
00:29:58.820 --> 00:30:01.920
This isn't gonna help your chances
of getting your job back either,


498
00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:03.420
OK,

499
00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:07.020
- Where the hell is he?
- Tom, relax,


500
00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:09.620
Relax? OJ's loose!

501
00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:14.320
- This is no time to relax!
- Tom! He's right over here!


502
00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:16.920
- Right there, right there, right there!
- OJ!


503
00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:19.220
- Right there!
- OJ!


504
00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:23.420
Stop! No, no, Stop, Stop,

505
00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:26.720
OJ, OJ...

506
00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:31.120
Get up, What the hell you doing
on my property? Planning to rob me?


507
00:30:31.220 --> 00:30:33.620
No, I
-I was just looking for...

508
00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:38.220
Yeah, yeah, I see what you're looking
for, You got a thing for young girls, eh?


509
00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:39.420
No,

510
00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:42.020
Then why do you keep
eyeing my wife, you perv?


511
00:30:42.020 --> 00:30:44.520
Your... no, I wasn't looking, l...

512
00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:47.520
Arthur, are you gonna be back soon?
I need you to spot me,


513
00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:49.320
Just give me a minute, honey,

514
00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:51.820
- Oh... Please don't kill me,
- I'm not gonna kill you, OK,


515
00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:56.120
If you let me live, I'll give you my
most valued possession, Here, take it,


516
00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:57.620
You know what that is, don't you?

517
00:30:57.720 --> 00:31:00.620
- Evander Holyfield's ear,
- What?


518
00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:04.220
The part of the ear that
Mike Tyson bit off and spit out,


519
00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:06.320
- But it's white,
- So?


520
00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:11.120
- So, shouldn't it be black?
- Well, if it's still on his head, sure,


521
00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:14.520
But anybody knows that a
severed ear loses its color,


522
00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:16.320
- No, 
- Sheryl?

523
00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:18.520
- Yeah?
- What happens to an ear


524
00:31:18.620 --> 00:31:22.820
- if it's severed from your head?
- It changes color, Duh,


525
00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:25.720
Damn!

526
00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:28.020
Tina, give me a beer,

527
00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:30.020
You have got to be kidding me,

528
00:31:30.020 --> 00:31:32.620
- Try another one,
- Come on, you guys!


529
00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:34.920
Party!

530
00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:38.020
- Come on, let's go!
- Audrey...


531
00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:40.820
- What the hell is going on in here?
- Heads up,


532
00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:41.920
Who are these people?

533
00:31:42.020 --> 00:31:44.720
I invited some friends over
to help us look for the owl,


534
00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:46.620
And Darryl even fixed
the table in the hall,


535
00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:48.520
- Thank you,
- He won't even know it was broken,


536
00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:50.820
Air ball,

537
00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:53.820
We'll get that later,
Everyone, this is Tom,


538
00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:55.720
- Yo, Tom,
- Hi, guys,


539
00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:57.220
You guys, Tom's a real good guy
and his nuts are gonna just...


540
00:31:57.220 --> 00:31:59.620
Audrey, could you...

541
00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:05.520
- What?
- Listen, I appreciate all your help,


542
00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:09.120
But could you make sure that your
friends stay out of the house?


543
00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:13.020
- All of them or just the colored guy?
- No, all of them,


544
00:32:13.620 --> 00:32:17.220
That's smart, That way the
colored guy won't take it personal,


545
00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:20.420
- I have nothing against... Look,
- What?


546
00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:21.920
I am responsible for this house

547
00:32:22.020 --> 00:32:24.720
and I can't have all of these
people hanging around,


548
00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:28.320
OK, all right, I got it,
You guys, let's move it out,


549
00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:31.120
- Aw, I was just getting started,
- Good idea,


550
00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:33.520
Thanks, guys, That's great,

551
00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:37.220
- What about the cake?
- Don't worry, they're all good people,


552
00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:40.020
They're not gonna steal nothing
or drink too much like the lndians,


553
00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:43.720
Look... just make sure they stay outside,

554
00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:46.320
- OK? 
- OK,

555
00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:54.920
- Lisa? 
- Hi, Tom,

556
00:32:55.020 --> 00:32:58.120
You're home? Why are you home?

557
00:32:58.220 --> 00:33:01.320
It's not worth going into,
I got in a huge fight with Hans,


558
00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:06.720
So... it's over?

559
00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:10.020
It's my own fault for dating
a guy my dad likes,


560
00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:11.120
Really?

561
00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:13.920
Yeah, he's one of his top marketing
execs, You know, Harvard Law,


562
00:33:14.020 --> 00:33:17.720
Comes from a good family, top
of the tennis letter at the country club,


563
00:33:17.820 --> 00:33:21.720
- Tom, can I talk to you for a second?
- Audrey?


564
00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:24.920
Yeah, She came to talk to your dad,

565
00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:29.820
OK, I'm gonna go in my room,
You could stay if you want,


566
00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:31.820
OK,

567
00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:34.620
- Tom?
- Audrey, I'll be right there, OK?


568
00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:36.320
OK,

569
00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:40.920
- Or you could go,
- You know, maybe we could talk...


570
00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:43.820
...later,

571
00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:47.120
Here, How about this one?

572
00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:49.720
- What's going on?
- We found the owl!


573
00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:53.120
- Where is he?
- Uh, well, he got away,


574
00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:55.720
- Where'd he go?
- He hopped somewhere in the bushes,


575
00:33:55.820 --> 00:33:58.020
- That's right,
- What are you doing?


576
00:33:58.020 --> 00:34:01.420
Getting hamburger meat,
That's a good way to lure birds,


577
00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:05.120
- They like hamburger meat?
- I don't know, I've never had a bird,


578
00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:07.720
- But most animals respond to meat,
- It's a fact,


579
00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:10.620
Wanna help me separate the meat?

580
00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:13.520
Speed, tell Tom about
the Kennedy assassination,


581
00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:16.320
This is so cool, Tom, 'cause Speed
knows who killed JFK,


582
00:34:16.420 --> 00:34:18.820
No, ask him! Tom, ask him,

583
00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:21.620
- Ask him who killed him,
- All right, All right,


584
00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:27.520
- Who killed JFK?
- Desi Arnaz,


585
00:34:29.220 --> 00:34:33.820
- Oh,
- His life just changed,


586
00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:56.820
Oh, God, Oh... oh... oh...

587
00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:00.920
- Tom!
- Shit, Lisa,


588
00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:05.120
- Uh, what are you doing in here?
- This is my closet,


589
00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:09.920
I had something in my pants,

590
00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:17.420
I was feeding the mouse to the bird
and he, uh, ran down my pants,


591
00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:19.920
I'm sorry that, uh...

592
00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:22.420
Oh, look! There it is!
That way! The bedroom,


593
00:35:24.620 --> 00:35:26.920
Watch out!

594
00:35:27.020 --> 00:35:31.020
- Oh, my gosh, Are you OK?
- Yep, Yep, I'm good,


595
00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:33.120
Don't worry, we'll get it later,

596
00:35:35.020 --> 00:35:36.820
Oh, here, Let me help you,

597
00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:40.420
You know, I'm really glad you stayed,
I needed a good laugh tonight,


598
00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:43.620
Thanks, Wow, Yeah, could I make
a bigger ass out of myself?


599
00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:48.820
- Do you want some wine?
- No, thanks,


600
00:35:48.820 --> 00:35:49.920
Yeah, sure,

601
00:35:50.020 --> 00:35:51.920
- Cheers, 
- Cheers,

602
00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:57.320
Oh, my God, Is that signed
by Walter Payton?


603
00:35:57.420 --> 00:36:01.520
Yeah, "Sweetness", '85 Bears, Only the
greatest team ever to play the game,


604
00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:05.920
Shut up, Walter Payton,
Jim McMahon, Mike Singletary,


605
00:36:06.020 --> 00:36:08.220
You know what?
You may be the coolest girl ever,


606
00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:10.520
- You like football?
- Yeah, I love it,


607
00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:12.520
I didn't know you guys liked football,

608
00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:15.320
Yeah, No, me and Paul
watch the game every Sunday,


609
00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:17.320
- Paul, too?
- Yeah,


610
00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:22.620
Oh, what's that?

611
00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:25.920
Oh, it's nothing,
It's just something I used to do,


612
00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:29.920
That is really good,
I didn't know you were an artist,


613
00:36:30.020 --> 00:36:33.620
I used to be, but I couldn't get any more
of my friends to pose nude for me,


614
00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:37.820
You wouldn't be interested, would you?

615
00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:41.320
You're blushing, 
I was just joking,

616
00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:45.620
I'm not blushing, I just-l just
get red from time to time,


617
00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:48.520
You are so funny,

618
00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:52.020
No, seriously, you should really
pursue this, I mean, you're good,


619
00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:56.020
I would, but it doesn't really fit in
with my father's plan for me,


620
00:36:56.020 --> 00:36:59.520
Future of Midnight Owl Publishing,

621
00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:02.220
Look! There it is,

622
00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:05.320
- He's right there, Through the door,
- We'll get him, We'll get him,


623
00:37:05.420 --> 00:37:07.720
Watch out!

624
00:37:07.820 --> 00:37:09.420
- Are you OK?
- Your dad's gonna kill me,


625
00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:12.420
No, don't worry about it,
It's my brother's, My dad won't care,


626
00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:13.720
Oh, Red,

627
00:37:13.820 --> 00:37:15.820
- Oh, so Dad told you?
- About what?


628
00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:18.520
- The restraining order,
- How's that?


629
00:37:18.620 --> 00:37:21.920
Yeah, Red's not allowed within

630
00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:24.020
He... uh, he didn't-he didn't mention that,

631
00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:27.620
Red's a freak, You don't want
to be around my dad if he finds out


632
00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:30.120
anyone was in this house,
especially Red,


633
00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:31.920
It's like wherever he is, there's trouble,

634
00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:34.120
I mean, one time, he had this big party
'cause Dad was out of town


635
00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:35.520
and my dad came home early...

636
00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:39.720
Hey, uh... you know, since the mouse is
gone, what say we, uh, go back inside?


637
00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:12.420
- It was up for an Oscar? I hated it!
- I know!


638
00:38:12.420 --> 00:38:16.720
Oh, I hated that movie!
Man, I can't believe you,


639
00:38:16.820 --> 00:38:20.520
You're like... you're so different
from how you are at work,


640
00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:24.620
What am I gonna do? Like, walk around
with my Walter Payton jersey?


641
00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:28.820
No, no, I get it, It's, like, at work
you have to be Lisa Taylor:


642
00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:32.620
the, you know, loyal employee
to the family firm,


643
00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:34.120
And I have to be... Tom...

644
00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:38.920
Tom Stansfield: the guy
who will do anything for anybody,


645
00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:42.420
Yup, That's me,

646
00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:47.320
I swear, it's like I can just
talk to you about anything,


647
00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:50.020
I know, exactly, It's...

648
00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:53.620
- Yeah, this is crazy,
- Yeah, it is,


649
00:38:54.820 --> 00:38:59.620
I guess it's because there's no
attraction between us, you know?


650
00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:00.720
Yeah,

651
00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:03.620
You know, there's none
of that sexual tension,


652
00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:05.320
- Yeah,
- It's like I'm with a girlfriend,


653
00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:07.520
- It's great, isn't it?
- Yeah,


654
00:39:07.620 --> 00:39:09.820
I mean, maybe we could go to the mall
sometime and go shopping,


655
00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:12.020
- That would be fun! Wouldn't it be fun?
- Yeah,


656
00:39:12.020 --> 00:39:14.020
Wait, you have to listen to this song,

657
00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:16.220
Come on, I need
someone to dance with!


658
00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:18.720
You don't want to see me dance,

659
00:39:18.820 --> 00:39:22.120
- Come on, dance with me,
- I have no idea what I'm doing,


660
00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:25.920
Come on, Put your hands together,
Yeah! Now go underneath,


661
00:39:26.020 --> 00:39:28.020
What... like this?

662
00:39:28.020 --> 00:39:31.320
- Like that?
- Yeah!


663
00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:34.820
Hold on, hold on, 
Watch, watch, watch,

664
00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:39.820
- Yeah! Oh...
- I'm trying to do too much,


665
00:39:43.220 --> 00:39:46.020
I'm a dancer,

666
00:39:46.020 --> 00:39:47.320
- Catch me,
- Oh... what?


667
00:39:51.020 --> 00:39:52.720
- I got you!
- Whoa!


668
00:39:55.520 --> 00:39:58.920
OK, I am doomed,

669
00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:01.920
Here,

670
00:40:04.820 --> 00:40:07.120
Oh, I love this song,

671
00:40:07.220 --> 00:40:10.120
My friend Jenny does this
really wild strip routine


672
00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:15.620
for her boyfriend to this song,
It's super sexy, Even you'd appreciate it,


673
00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:20.920
I wish I could be like her, you know?
She's so free and everything,


674
00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:16.920
So, what do you think?

675
00:41:17.020 --> 00:41:22.020
Ah, it's... it's, uh, very nice,

676
00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:25.620
So if you weren't gay,
this would turn you on, right?


677
00:41:26.420 --> 00:41:32.120
- Gay? Who said I was gay?
- My father, You mean it's not true?


678
00:41:32.220 --> 00:41:35.120
- No!
- No? God, I'm so embarrassed!


679
00:41:35.220 --> 00:41:38.820
- I can't believe you'd let me do this!
- I didn't mean to... I mean, um...


680
00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:41.220
Why would your father say that I'm gay?

681
00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:45.920
I don't know, Well, you can't blame him
entirely, I mean, you are a little feminine,


682
00:41:46.020 --> 00:41:48.620
Don't be hurt,

683
00:41:50.020 --> 00:41:52.220
It's OK,

684
00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:55.020
Hans is a bit of feminine, too,

685
00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:58.720
What exactly did Hans do anyway?

686
00:41:59.620 --> 00:42:02.620
Well, it's not like
he did just one thing,

687
00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:07.920
It's more about trust,

688
00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:11.820
Yeah, Trust is... it's important,

689
00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:15.220
Trust is everything,

690
00:42:15.220 --> 00:42:20.020
I don't know, Maybe it's me, It's like
I'm just sending out some kind of vibe,


691
00:42:20.020 --> 00:42:22.520
- I can't attract a decent guy,
- No,


692
00:42:22.620 --> 00:42:24.720
- What's wrong with me?
- Don't even worry about it,


693
00:42:24.820 --> 00:42:27.920
You're gonna find another guy so fast,

694
00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:33.620
I mean, look at you, 
You're amazing,

695
00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:39.420
- You really think so?
- Why do you think I'm here tonight?


696
00:42:41.020 --> 00:42:44.220
Oh, God, Tom,

697
00:42:46.020 --> 00:42:49.120
You didn't know, 
You thought that...

698
00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:05.420
I'm gonna... I'll be right back,

699
00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:10.020
I'm just gonna go and check
and see if Audrey needs towels,


700
00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:12.720
Tom, you don't have to lie to me,

701
00:43:12.820 --> 00:43:16.520
If you have to go to the bathroom,
go take a crap and come back,


702
00:43:27.620 --> 00:43:31.220
What the... hey! What the hell
are you doing here, man?


703
00:43:35.220 --> 00:43:39.420
You try to bone Vasquez out of 20 grand
and you ask me what I'm doing?


704
00:43:39.420 --> 00:43:43.620
You think I work for Mrs, Fields? You
think my boss likes to bake cookies?


705
00:43:44.420 --> 00:43:47.520
- Whoa! What are you doing? Come on,
- You tried to sell me flour,


706
00:43:47.620 --> 00:43:51.520
Flour? I-I don't even know what
you're talk... What are you... Come on!


707
00:43:51.620 --> 00:43:53.920
Look, I'm just housesitting for my boss,

708
00:43:54.020 --> 00:43:57.020
- Who's your boss?
- Jack Taylor,


709
00:43:57.120 --> 00:44:02.420
Jack Taylor, huh? I did time
in Joliet with a Jack Taylor,


710
00:44:02.520 --> 00:44:07.420
Average height, medium hair,
horrible case of folliculitis on his ass?


711
00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:11.020
- I wouldn't know about the folliculitis,
- I thought you said he was your boss,


712
00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:14.120
- He is,
- And you never saw his ass?


713
00:44:14.220 --> 00:44:17.020
- Why would I see my boss's ass?
- It stands to reason,


714
00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:20.420
You work for a guy long enough,
sooner or later,


715
00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:23.420
you're gonna get a glimpse of his ass,

716
00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:27.120
Listen, I-I don't know
what line of work you're in,


717
00:44:27.220 --> 00:44:30.220
but I've never seen my boss's ass,

718
00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:33.220
Hey, man...

719
00:44:33.220 --> 00:44:36.020
Hey! Hey, stop it
or I'm gonna call the cops!


720
00:44:36.020 --> 00:44:39.620
And tell them what?
Your drug deal went bad?


721
00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:42.220
You rat me out, I'm gonna
carve you up like a turkey


722
00:44:42.220 --> 00:44:44.920
and beat your kids
with what's left of you,


723
00:44:45.020 --> 00:44:48.320
- I don't have any kids,
- I can wait,


724
00:44:57.520 --> 00:45:02.520
Excuse me, Hello? Right, OK,

725
00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:06.220
Tommy, let's get clear on something,

726
00:45:06.220 --> 00:45:10.020
In the next 60 minutes, I'm gonna
bring Vasquez what he paid for


727
00:45:10.120 --> 00:45:12.820
or your gift-wrapped nuts,

728
00:45:19.420 --> 00:45:21.520
- Oh, hi, Tom, What's going on?
- Yeah, That's what I wanna know,


729
00:45:21.620 --> 00:45:24.920
What's going on with your dad's gift?
See... Do you see that guy?


730
00:45:25.020 --> 00:45:26.520
He was gonna kill me!

731
00:45:26.620 --> 00:45:28.520
Don't you think you're
overreacting a little, Tom?


732
00:45:28.620 --> 00:45:33.620
Overreacting? The guy had a knife!
I don't think that I am overreacting!


733
00:45:33.620 --> 00:45:35.820
He probably just had the wrong address,

734
00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:40.120
I mean, there's gotta be over a dozen
Jack Taylor's in Chicago alone,


735
00:45:40.220 --> 00:45:43.620
I'm gonna go to my dad's bedroom,
You tell me if the guy shows up again,


736
00:45:43.620 --> 00:45:45.220
All right, All right, 
You listen to me,

737
00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:47.520
You're not even supposed
to be in this house,


738
00:45:47.620 --> 00:45:48.520
Says who?

739
00:45:48.620 --> 00:45:51.420
I know about the restraining order, Red,

740
00:45:51.420 --> 00:45:56.120
Restraining-shmaining, I mean,
that's just a big misunderstanding,


741
00:45:56.220 --> 00:45:57.820
Tom! It's OJ!

742
00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:08.620
- Whoa, Hey, Who are you?
- I'm here to see Lisa, My name's Hans,


743
00:46:10.820 --> 00:46:12.220
- Is that so shocking?
- No,


744
00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:13.920
What, you surprised she'd go out
with someone like me?


745
00:46:14.020 --> 00:46:15.220
No, no, It's not...

746
00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:17.820
Give me a break, man,
You oughta be ashamed of yourself,


747
00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:20.220
Let me tell you something,
There are a lot of girls out there


748
00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:22.620
who can see past the fact
that I just happen to be...


749
00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:24.220
a few pounds overweight,

750
00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:26.720
You know, inside
I'm just like everyone else,


751
00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:29.920
- Let me get you a tissue,
- Thank you,


752
00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:32.120
- I'm on the second day of a new diet,
- Hey, uh, Hans...


753
00:46:32.220 --> 00:46:34.020
- I gave up chocolate,
- I'm really sorry,


754
00:46:34.120 --> 00:46:36.720
I think that, uh, we just
got off on the wrong foot,


755
00:46:36.820 --> 00:46:42.220
Oh... uh... It's good
to meet you, Hans, I'm Tom,


756
00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:43.520
l, uh...

757
00:46:43.620 --> 00:46:46.320
I'm just a friend of Lisa's,

758
00:46:46.420 --> 00:46:49.520
Oh, great, Well, maybe you can
help me, Is she here? Lisa! Lisa!


759
00:46:49.620 --> 00:46:51.220
Whoa, Hans, you know what?

760
00:46:51.320 --> 00:46:54.220
Maybe right now isn't a great time
for you to see Lisa,


761
00:46:54.320 --> 00:46:56.420
What say, uh, we get you a drink?

762
00:46:56.520 --> 00:46:59.320
Oh, OK, Yeah, she's
probably really upset,


763
00:46:59.420 --> 00:47:03.920
You see, we got in a misunderstanding
tonight and, well, she left me,


764
00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:06.120
- Wow, that's unfortunate,
- Yeah,


765
00:47:06.220 --> 00:47:08.020
What happened?

766
00:47:08.020 --> 00:47:12.320
Well, I think seeing me naked from
behind like that kind of shocked her,


767
00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:16.320
Oh, So, tonight was the first time,

768
00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:19.120
Yeah, Tonight was the first time,
It was awesome,


769
00:47:19.220 --> 00:47:22.320
I mean, I was lying up on the bed like
this with one leg straight up in the air,


770
00:47:22.420 --> 00:47:24.320
- I don't think I really need to see...
- And I had a handful of ass right here...


771
00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:25.320
- Whoa,
- ...and I had a handful of this,


772
00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:29.020
Hans, please, Whoa,
God, you're... that's...


773
00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:33.720
- And that's when Lisa walked in,
- What?


774
00:47:33.820 --> 00:47:36.520
She caught me in
the bed with a blonde,

775
00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:38.020
What?

776
00:47:38.120 --> 00:47:40.820
Aw, come on, man, Tell me you
haven't ever wanted to do it with a...


777
00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:44.020
Hans, Hans, No... you cheated on her,

778
00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:48.820
You know something, Tom?
You're right,


779
00:47:48.920 --> 00:47:53.720
Aw, I guess that was cheating,
And now I've gone and lost everyone,


780
00:47:53.720 --> 00:47:56.320
I should have known
from the start it wasn't right,


781
00:47:56.420 --> 00:47:58.920
She kept telling me
I reminded her of her dad,


782
00:47:58.920 --> 00:48:02.020
Hans, you gotta realize
that this is over, you know?


783
00:48:02.020 --> 00:48:05.620
And you gotta put an end to it,
and-and move on,


784
00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:09.120
- And get yourself to a better place, OK?
- Yes,


785
00:48:09.220 --> 00:48:13.320
- I think you know what I mean,
- Yeah, I do know what you mean,


786
00:48:13.420 --> 00:48:17.520
And I'm ready, 
I know what I have to do,

787
00:48:21.820 --> 00:48:24.020
Well, I guess this is good-bye,

788
00:48:27.420 --> 00:48:31.520
OJ!

789
00:48:31.620 --> 00:48:33.320
Thanks, Tom,

790
00:48:33.420 --> 00:48:35.320
OJ, come back!

791
00:48:38.120 --> 00:48:40.120
OJ!

792
00:48:50.620 --> 00:48:54.220
Hello, You must be Julie's date,
Come in, Come in,


793
00:48:54.320 --> 00:48:57.720
Actually I'm just here looking for a bird,

794
00:48:57.820 --> 00:49:01.220
Make yourself at home, Albert,
Julie's still getting ready,


795
00:49:01.320 --> 00:49:04.520
- No, actually, uh, my name is Tom,
- I'm sorry, I'm hard of hearing,


796
00:49:04.620 --> 00:49:07.120
- Could you speak up, please?
- My name is Tom!


797
00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:09.620
I could've sworn Julie
said your name was Albert,


798
00:49:09.620 --> 00:49:11.320
No, see, I'm afraid that you're mistaken,

799
00:49:11.420 --> 00:49:15.620
- Is someone here?
- Yes, This is Julie's date, Albert,


800
00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:17.320
- Ah! Ah!
- This is my nephew, George,


801
00:49:17.420 --> 00:49:21.620
- He's blind and crippled,
- Nice to meet you,


802
00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:22.920
I'm not deaf,

803
00:49:23.020 --> 00:49:27.620
Excuse me, I'll go see what's
keeping Julie, She's probably nervous,


804
00:49:27.720 --> 00:49:29.520
So you're Julie's date, huh?

805
00:49:29.620 --> 00:49:32.820
No, I'm just... I just came here,
I was looking for an owl,


806
00:49:32.920 --> 00:49:36.820
You don't have
to make lame excuses,


807
00:49:36.820 --> 00:49:40.620
Listen, do you know what the
advantage is in being a cripple?


808
00:49:40.620 --> 00:49:42.520
No, I can't say that I do,

809
00:49:42.520 --> 00:49:44.820
You don't really care to hear much
what I have to say, do you?


810
00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:47.620
No, no, It's not that, I'm...

811
00:49:48.620 --> 00:49:50.620
You know what?
Go ahead, I'm listening,


812
00:49:50.720 --> 00:49:52.920
Sit down, Tom,

813
00:49:56.920 --> 00:49:59.420
You know what I gained
by becoming a quad?


814
00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:01.520
What, are you shaking your head?
I can't see, you know!


815
00:50:01.620 --> 00:50:06.420
I'm sorry, Uh... uh...
Tell me what you gained,


816
00:50:06.520 --> 00:50:09.420
I no longer need my Viagra,

817
00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:13.820
Now I can maintain
my arousal for hours,


818
00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:16.420
That's-that's great,
I guess things have a way


819
00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:18.220
of evening themselves out
in the long run, huh?


820
00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:20.720
No, not really, 
And do you know why?

821
00:50:20.820 --> 00:50:22.120
No, why?

822
00:50:22.220 --> 00:50:24.620
Because I am a blind,
quad freak, you moron!


823
00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:26.720
What, you think women dig this?!

824
00:50:26.820 --> 00:50:28.020
- I mean, you think women go...
- Well, hello,


825
00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:30.020
..."l wanna give that mutant
freak my number"?


826
00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:33.420
- Ken Morehouse, I'm Julie's dad,
- Hey, nice to meet you,


827
00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:37.020
ls, uh, George boring you
with his self-pitying tripe?


828
00:50:37.020 --> 00:50:39.420
- Tripe...
- No, not at all,


829
00:50:39.420 --> 00:50:42.720
"I'm blind, I'm crippled, Boohoo-hoo,"

830
00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:45.820
Leave the room, I wanna talk
to Albert alone for a second,


831
00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:48.220
- I can stay if I want,
- Leave the room!


832
00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:49.520
- OK, OK,
- Get out!


833
00:50:49.620 --> 00:50:52.020
- You don't have to be huffy about it!
- Get out now! Get out!


834
00:50:52.020 --> 00:50:55.720
- OK,
- Turn it, turn it, turn it,


835
00:50:55.720 --> 00:50:58.720
For God's sakes,

836
00:50:58.820 --> 00:51:01.720
- I'm so sorry,
- Who the hell put that there?


837
00:51:02.920 --> 00:51:06.320
My daughter's gonna be a few minutes,
Have a-Have a seat, Albert,


838
00:51:06.320 --> 00:51:08.020
- Tom, 
- No, Ken,

839
00:51:08.120 --> 00:51:09.420
- Right, You're Ken,
- Yes,


840
00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:12.920
Before you say anything, Albert,
I just want you to know that Julie


841
00:51:12.920 --> 00:51:17.520
is really self-conscious about her
appearance since the... the accident,


842
00:51:17.620 --> 00:51:18.720
Right...

843
00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:23.220
- Oh, Julie,
- Julie, this is Albert, Albert, Julie,


844
00:51:23.320 --> 00:51:27.120
- It's nice to meet you, Albert,
- Wow, It's... wow,


845
00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:32.620
It's nice to meet you, too,
But, the thing is, is that I'm not Albert,


846
00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:38.420
- That is to say that I'm not your date,
- Oh,


847
00:51:38.420 --> 00:51:41.420
There's been a giant misunderstanding,

848
00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:45.020
- How could you?
- I knew this would happen!


849
00:51:45.120 --> 00:51:47.320
No, I'm telling the truth,

850
00:51:47.420 --> 00:51:50.420
Julie wasn't pretty enough
for you, Mr, GQ? Is that it?


851
00:51:50.520 --> 00:51:55.020
- No, you don't understand,
- Oh, I understand, Fabio,


852
00:51:55.120 --> 00:51:57.920
- You broke that poor girl's heart,
- No, no, See, I'm not...


853
00:51:58.020 --> 00:52:01.420
Do you think Julie is an idiot? Do you
think she bought your little fairy tale


854
00:52:01.520 --> 00:52:04.120
Mr, I'm Too Sexy
for my medical booties?


855
00:52:04.920 --> 00:52:07.520
- Oh, th...
- Get the hell out of here,


856
00:52:07.620 --> 00:52:12.220
Or I'll kick your pretty-boy ass
to kingdom come,


857
00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:16.220
- Am I interrupting something?
- No, it's just that the...


858
00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:23.420
Tom, there's two things
that we need to talk about,


859
00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:24.520
What?

860
00:52:24.620 --> 00:52:26.820
First of all, I don't wanna
wear these booties anymore,


861
00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:29.820
- No one else is wearing the booties,
- Fine,


862
00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:33.720
- What's the other thing?
- Tina thinks she's got cancer,


863
00:52:35.620 --> 00:52:37.820
- Do you feel it?
- I'm just...


864
00:52:37.820 --> 00:52:42.220
- What's supposed to be there? I don't...
- See, Tina?


865
00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:45.420
Move your hand to the left,
Now move it around,


866
00:52:47.820 --> 00:52:51.520
- Don't you feel anything?
- Yeah, I mean, no, no,


867
00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:53.320
No, it seems to be... Well...

868
00:52:53.420 --> 00:52:56.020
Tina, your breast is no
different than mine, OK?


869
00:52:56.020 --> 00:53:01.120
- It is, There's no comparison,
- Tom, feel my breast and compare,


870
00:53:01.220 --> 00:53:04.020
Now, do you detect any difference
between our breasts?


871
00:53:04.020 --> 00:53:07.120
- Well... You gotta slow down a little,
- It sure feels good,


872
00:53:07.220 --> 00:53:09.820
Well, yours is a...

873
00:53:09.820 --> 00:53:13.120
- Lisa, this isn't what it looks like,
- I believed everything you said,


874
00:53:13.720 --> 00:53:14.620
I'm...

875
00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:16.220
It was all just a
bunch of lines, wasn't it?

876
00:53:16.320 --> 00:53:20.420
No, no, Lisa, it was all...
I swear to you, I meant every word,


877
00:53:20.520 --> 00:53:21.920
This is... nothing's going on here,

878
00:53:22.020 --> 00:53:24.920
Great, Tom, I'm glad you think
I'm a complete idiot,


879
00:53:24.920 --> 00:53:29.820
No, no, I'm telling you, I was just
checking these girls for breast cancer,


880
00:53:30.520 --> 00:53:35.120
- You make me sick,
- No... Lisa, wait!


881
00:53:35.720 --> 00:53:38.520
- She's never gonna forgive me,
- Of course she will,


882
00:53:38.520 --> 00:53:39.720
Is this the first
time you cheated on her?

883
00:53:39.820 --> 00:53:43.120
Yeah, No! I... yeah... wait,

884
00:53:43.220 --> 00:53:46.720
I didn't cheat on her, I mean,
you were there for God's sakes!


885
00:53:46.820 --> 00:53:48.320
Look, I know that
you didn't cheat on her,


886
00:53:48.420 --> 00:53:50.620
- I mean, you were a little grabby, but...
- I...


887
00:53:50.620 --> 00:53:52.220
Look, don't you think
we should just find the owl


888
00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:54.120
and worry about your little "affair" later?

889
00:53:54.220 --> 00:53:57.220
l... I am get... I'm getting angry
and I don't get angry,


890
00:53:57.320 --> 00:53:58.820
Hey, Speed?

891
00:53:58.920 --> 00:54:01.020
Hey, can I ask you a question?

892
00:54:02.220 --> 00:54:06.720
- What are you... I thought you left,
- I did... to get this,


893
00:54:07.420 --> 00:54:11.120
- All right, Why is the fire going?
- Cozy, isn't it?


894
00:54:11.220 --> 00:54:15.220
- All right, You put that down,
- Make me,


895
00:54:16.420 --> 00:54:18.420
All right,

896
00:54:20.420 --> 00:54:24.520
Hey! Hey! Put the crowbar down!

897
00:54:24.620 --> 00:54:28.120
Or I will blow your ass to fucktown!

898
00:54:39.820 --> 00:54:42.720
That's right,

899
00:54:44.120 --> 00:54:47.120
- Don't you ever threaten me,
- But... I got a gun,


900
00:54:49.320 --> 00:54:52.920
- What are you doing?
- Well, Tommy, we both have guns,


901
00:54:53.020 --> 00:54:55.720
Only difference is, you don't
have the guts to use yours,


902
00:54:55.820 --> 00:55:00.320
Oh, yeah?
Well, what makes you so sure?


903
00:55:01.820 --> 00:55:03.920
Oh, I'm sure,

904
00:55:10.720 --> 00:55:17.020
Oh! Oh... Jesus! What the...
What are you, out of your mind?


905
00:55:17.020 --> 00:55:20.820
Stop that! Are you crazy, man?!

906
00:55:22.820 --> 00:55:25.620
- Hello?
- Stansfield. Anything to report?


907
00:55:25.720 --> 00:55:29.420
Sir! Everything's great,
I got... everything's under control,


908
00:55:29.420 --> 00:55:31.420
Did OJ get enough water?

909
00:55:31.520 --> 00:55:33.820
OJ... What? Oh, yes,

910
00:55:33.920 --> 00:55:37.620
Uh, Jack, could you hold on?
I'm gonna shoot your pecker off,


911
00:55:37.720 --> 00:55:40.320
I don't plan on being away
the entire weekend.


912
00:55:40.420 --> 00:55:41.520
- I hate you! I hate you!
- It's possible I may be


913
00:55:41.520 --> 00:55:45.820
coming home early, so make sure
that everything's in order.


914
00:55:45.820 --> 00:55:46.820
Jesus!

915
00:55:46.920 --> 00:55:48.720
Oh, something I forgot to tell you.

916
00:55:48.820 --> 00:55:51.820
- Sir?
- The fishtank. It's a little low.


917
00:55:51.820 --> 00:55:53.820
- I'm taking care of that right now,
- Good.


918
00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:56.620
When I get back, I want to talk to you
about that position in Creative.


919
00:55:56.720 --> 00:55:58.720
Don't get excited yet.

920
00:55:58.820 --> 00:56:00.720
I didn't say you had the job.
We'll discuss it.


921
00:56:00.720 --> 00:56:04.020
Thank you, sir, great, Bye,

922
00:56:05.920 --> 00:56:08.320
Holy shit!

923
00:56:11.620 --> 00:56:14.020
I just...

924
00:56:15.820 --> 00:56:20.020
Boy, I'm tapped out,
You got anything to drink?


925
00:56:20.020 --> 00:56:24.020
In the kitchen, Thanks,

926
00:56:28.520 --> 00:56:30.020
Dammit!

927
00:56:30.020 --> 00:56:35.720
Whoa! What the hay happened in here?
Tom, did you have a little accident?


928
00:56:35.820 --> 00:56:39.720
You might wanna try a few Kegels,
Kinda tighten it up down there,


929
00:56:39.820 --> 00:56:45.420
- That's it!
- I'm doing 'em right now, And release,


930
00:56:45.420 --> 00:56:49.320
Well, when in Rome...

931
00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:53.220
Oh, Canada

932
00:57:02.720 --> 00:57:07.420
"Jack Taylor, Rectacid,
Apply liberally to buttocks as needed


933
00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:12.020
to reduce redness
and other symptoms of folliculitis,"


934
00:57:15.620 --> 00:57:17.820
Son of a bitch,

935
00:57:17.920 --> 00:57:22.120
- Did you piss yourself?
- No, I did not piss myself,


936
00:57:22.120 --> 00:57:23.620
- Looks like you did,
- Well, I didn't,


937
00:57:23.620 --> 00:57:25.720
It was that maniac downstairs,

938
00:57:25.820 --> 00:57:28.420
We gotta stop him before
he tears this house apart,


939
00:57:28.520 --> 00:57:31.620
You know what you gotta do?
Give him one of these little babies,


940
00:57:31.720 --> 00:57:32.920
- What's that?
- It's a sleeping pill,


941
00:57:33.020 --> 00:57:36.820
I got 'em from Speed, Here,
So strong, so be careful,


942
00:57:36.920 --> 00:57:38.920
- It's powerful stuff,
- Here, Just one,


943
00:57:39.020 --> 00:57:42.620
Be careful,

944
00:57:46.120 --> 00:57:48.120
Hey, Excuse me,

945
00:57:48.220 --> 00:57:51.820
You know, I just wanted to apologize
for pulling that gun on you earlier,


946
00:57:51.820 --> 00:57:55.320
That was totally out of line,

947
00:57:55.320 --> 00:57:57.820
Hey, you know, I don't
even know your name,


948
00:57:57.820 --> 00:58:01.120
- I'm TJ,
- TJ? That's nice,


949
00:58:01.120 --> 00:58:06.720
I guess maybe I was out of line
by pissing all over everything,


950
00:58:06.820 --> 00:58:11.420
Man... that was funny,

951
00:58:11.520 --> 00:58:16.120
Yeah, I've always enjoyed a good prank,
What are you drinking there?


952
00:58:16.220 --> 00:58:18.420
Whiskey, You want some?

953
00:58:18.520 --> 00:58:19.920
There's plenty of booze
around here, that's for sure,


954
00:58:20.020 --> 00:58:22.620
Yeah, I'll take a shot of bourbon,

955
00:58:22.720 --> 00:58:25.720
- Oh, my God!
- What?


956
00:58:25.820 --> 00:58:27.820
Whoa! Look at those
two blondes going at...


957
00:58:27.920 --> 00:58:29.720
- Oh, wait, are there three of them?
- Where?


958
00:58:29.820 --> 00:58:32.720
They're going at it right up there
on the second floor,


959
00:58:32.820 --> 00:58:38.620
- Where are you looking?
- Right th... uh... Oh, man, they left,


960
00:58:40.320 --> 00:58:44.520
Damn, I was all psyched up
for some action,


961
00:58:44.520 --> 00:58:47.820
Lesbians are very special,

962
00:58:47.920 --> 00:58:51.320
Oh... Hey, I'll drink to that, huh?

963
00:58:52.520 --> 00:58:55.520
- Cheers,
- All right,


964
00:58:59.420 --> 00:59:00.720
Are you...

965
00:59:00.720 --> 00:59:03.420
Here, Why don't I...

966
00:59:19.620 --> 00:59:23.520
Audrey?

967
00:59:23.620 --> 00:59:26.920
Audrey!

968
00:59:26.920 --> 00:59:31.320
Oh, my God!
He's like a human vibrator,


969
00:59:31.420 --> 00:59:33.620
What... All right,
what is wrong with him?


970
00:59:33.720 --> 00:59:36.220
- I don't know, Did you slip him the pill?
- Yes,


971
00:59:36.220 --> 00:59:37.220
Then that must be it then,

972
00:59:37.320 --> 00:59:39.220
You didn't give him the pill
with whiskey, did you?


973
00:59:39.220 --> 00:59:41.220
- Yeah, 
- Oh, no!

974
00:59:41.320 --> 00:59:44.920
- You're not supposed to mix the two,
- Audrey, you did not tell me that!


975
00:59:45.020 --> 00:59:47.520
Everyone knows that you're not
supposed to mix booze with pills!


976
00:59:47.620 --> 00:59:50.520
- Come on!
- OK, Is he gonna be OK?


977
00:59:50.620 --> 00:59:53.520
Don't worry, He'll be fine,
I used to be a paramedic,


978
00:59:53.620 --> 00:59:57.420
- Tom? I think I found OJ,
- OJ? I don't care about...


979
00:59:57.520 --> 01:00:00.220
We have a situation here,
Audrey, call 911!


980
01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:03.120
- I'm telling ya, he'll be fine,
- Are you sure?


981
01:00:03.220 --> 01:00:06.520
- He just needs some rest, I'm positive,
- OK, You watch TJ, Use this,


982
01:00:06.620 --> 01:00:09.320
It's not loaded, but he doesn't know that,

983
01:00:09.420 --> 01:00:10.920
Oh, man!

984
01:00:12.820 --> 01:00:15.620
Julie,

985
01:00:15.620 --> 01:00:17.920
- From... yeah,
- Down the block, That's right,


986
01:00:18.020 --> 01:00:19.120
You mind if I come in?

987
01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:20.320
All right, You grab his ankles...

988
01:00:20.420 --> 01:00:22.420
Why don't we go
to that room over there?


989
01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:26.120
- OK, yeah, I got this end,
- Man, he's heavy,


990
01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:30.520
Do you mind if I sit down?

991
01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:34.720
- Uh... yeah, Sure,
- Thank you,


992
01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:41.920
Oh, hey, Sorry to
butt in, Hi, I'm Red,

993
01:00:42.020 --> 01:00:44.320
- Hi, it's nice to meet you,
- Nice to meet ya,


994
01:00:44.420 --> 01:00:47.920
Anyway, I realized you were telling
the truth when my real date showed up,


995
01:00:48.020 --> 01:00:52.520
- Of course he didn't stick around,
- Well, that guy is a bum,


996
01:00:52.620 --> 01:00:54.620
Well, I'm sure that had
nothing to do with you,


997
01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:56.120
No, I know it did,

998
01:00:56.120 --> 01:00:59.920
I've never had any guys attracted to me,
even before the accident,


999
01:01:00.020 --> 01:01:02.120
Now that cannot be true,

1000
01:01:02.220 --> 01:01:05.620
Well... about six months ago,
I was hitchhiking


1001
01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:08.720
and a trucker tried to rape me,
but other than that...


1002
01:01:08.820 --> 01:01:12.220
Come on, You're gonna tell me,
you never had a real boyfriend?


1003
01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:16.220
Well, once, but I think
he just felt sorry for me,


1004
01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:19.520
Oh, well, uh... how long did that last?

1005
01:01:19.620 --> 01:01:24.020
Um... about six years
and then one day, he just left,


1006
01:01:24.020 --> 01:01:27.920
- Another woman?
- No, He got hit by a bus,


1007
01:01:28.020 --> 01:01:29.620
Well, see that's not your fault,

1008
01:01:29.620 --> 01:01:32.120
Well, he didn't seem to try
very hard to avoid the bus,


1009
01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:34.720
I think he just wanted
out of the relationship,


1010
01:01:34.820 --> 01:01:37.420
Julie, why don't you sit in this chair?

1011
01:01:37.420 --> 01:01:39.820
Oh, geez, I'm starting
to feel a bit woozy,


1012
01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:45.320
OK, All right, 
I have to go find OJ,

1013
01:01:45.420 --> 01:01:49.920
So, Red, if you could watch things
for me, that'd be great,


1014
01:01:50.020 --> 01:01:53.120
Got ya,

1015
01:01:56.320 --> 01:01:59.820
Look, I think you're being
way too hard on yourself,


1016
01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:04.120
I mean, besides, I bet there've been a lot
of guys who've been attracted to you,


1017
01:02:04.220 --> 01:02:06.820
No, he was the only one,

1018
01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:10.620
What about that trucker? I mean,
he was obviously attracted to you,


1019
01:02:10.620 --> 01:02:13.620
I think the trucker probably
would have raped anyone,


1020
01:02:13.620 --> 01:02:17.420
I doubt that, You were probably
pretty special to him,


1021
01:02:17.420 --> 01:02:19.620
So sweet of you, Red,

1022
01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:22.920
I'm not just jerking
your chain either, I mean it,


1023
01:02:29.420 --> 01:02:34.620
- What are you doing to the lawn?
- It's OK, Tom, We just had to bury TJ,


1024
01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:38.420
Bury... what? You mean, he's...

1025
01:02:39.420 --> 01:02:42.520
You said he was gonna be OK!
I thought you were a paramedic,


1026
01:02:42.620 --> 01:02:46.020
- Well, I took a course,
- You took... you-you guy...


1027
01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:48.020
You can't just bury him, you guys!

1028
01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:49.920
Well, we're not gonna
put him in my car,

1029
01:02:50.020 --> 01:02:53.520
- That's right,
- All right, Forget it, I'm calling 911 ,


1030
01:02:53.620 --> 01:02:56.420
- That's for emergencies,
- What do you think this is?


1031
01:02:56.420 --> 01:02:59.620
The guy's dead, In 20 minutes,
he's still gonna be dead,


1032
01:02:59.620 --> 01:03:02.120
There's no sense of urgency here,

1033
01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:05.220
No, we have to call the cops
and report it!


1034
01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:10.520
- And tell 'em what?
- The truth! That there was a... accident,


1035
01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:15.020
- They might not see it that way,
- Let's face it, Tom, You did kill him,


1036
01:03:15.020 --> 01:03:18.520
- You gave me the pill,
- Hey, I didn't tell you to kill nobody, OK?


1037
01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:20.220
Well, you didn't tell me
not to use the whiskey!


1038
01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:23.420
- Well, if you'd listen to me...
- You didn't say anything about whiskey!


1039
01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:25.320
I would think you would listen to me!

1040
01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:26.820
There's no time for blame games,

1041
01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:29.620
Why don't you spread around
some leaves? Make it look good,


1042
01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:32.820
I am not gonna help
you conceal a dead body!


1043
01:03:32.820 --> 01:03:36.020
Hey, you know what? Don't you
think we should say something?


1044
01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:37.320
- What?
- You know what? She's right,


1045
01:03:37.420 --> 01:03:40.120
Some kind of last rites or eulogy
or something like that?


1046
01:03:40.220 --> 01:03:42.520
- I'm so screwed,
- We should say something,


1047
01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:49.120
Fine, fine, You know what? Say
something, Get... just make it quick,


1048
01:03:49.220 --> 01:03:55.220
Lord, this day we lay to rest TJ,
who was, uh...


1049
01:03:55.820 --> 01:03:57.820
- I really didn't know him,
- I don't know him,


1050
01:03:57.920 --> 01:03:59.720
I mean, Tom, you know him the best,
Why don't you say something?


1051
01:03:59.720 --> 01:04:01.220
- Me? 
- Yeah,

1052
01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:05.820
All I know is that the guy was a violent,
sadistic goon that was into lesbians,


1053
01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:08.220
Amen,

1054
01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:11.720
- Tom? 
- Lisa,

1055
01:04:11.820 --> 01:04:14.520
- I can't believe you're still here,
- Listen, please,


1056
01:04:14.620 --> 01:04:15.820
You have to let me explain,

1057
01:04:15.820 --> 01:04:19.620
Look, Tom, Tonight was just a
big mistake, That's all there is to it,


1058
01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:26.520
No, you... that... what you saw with
the girls, all that was was weird timing,


1059
01:04:26.620 --> 01:04:29.320
Red? What's Red doing here?

1060
01:04:29.420 --> 01:04:33.420
Red? Oh, uh, Red
was in the neighborhood


1061
01:04:33.420 --> 01:04:34.920
and he-and he stopped by,

1062
01:04:35.020 --> 01:04:38.220
But, you see, nothing really
bad happened tonight,


1063
01:04:38.220 --> 01:04:44.020
- Is he the reason OJ's gone?
- No, No, uh... OJ got loose,


1064
01:04:44.020 --> 01:04:46.620
And that's a little problem,
But we're gonna find him,


1065
01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:49.120
And we're looking for him, so...

1066
01:04:49.220 --> 01:04:50.620
What's this?

1067
01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:54.720
Tom killed a guy
and we're burying the body,


1068
01:04:54.820 --> 01:04:57.020
OK, that was bad,

1069
01:04:57.120 --> 01:05:00.220
OK, well, now you're
overreacting, It's not...


1070
01:05:10.020 --> 01:05:11.720
All right, all right, hey,

1071
01:05:11.820 --> 01:05:17.420
Anybody moves, there's gonna be
a big hole where her brain used to be,


1072
01:05:19.620 --> 01:05:22.820
Yeah, Go ahead, shoot,

1073
01:05:23.720 --> 01:05:25.820
Well, what are you waiting for?
Come on!


1074
01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:27.220
What are you waiting for?!
Waste the bitch!


1075
01:05:27.320 --> 01:05:29.220
- Tom!
- No, I don't give a shit!


1076
01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:33.020
- Hey, I'm not joking, asshole,
- Yeah?


1077
01:05:33.020 --> 01:05:36.820
Pull the trigger, Come on, Come on!

1078
01:05:38.620 --> 01:05:42.420
I think you're just all talk,

1079
01:05:46.020 --> 01:05:48.920
Looks like we both got guns,

1080
01:05:50.520 --> 01:05:53.420
Who's gonna shoot first this time?

1081
01:06:01.520 --> 01:06:03.720
Well, that should do it,

1082
01:06:03.820 --> 01:06:06.820
Tom! You are so brave,

1083
01:06:06.820 --> 01:06:10.120
No, no, It's not even that big of a deal,
This gun's not even loaded...


1084
01:06:11.420 --> 01:06:13.320
What the hell is going on?

1085
01:06:13.420 --> 01:06:16.820
I never should have doubted you,
You risked your life for me,


1086
01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:19.720
Audrey found some bullets in
the kitchen and I may have reloaded it,


1087
01:06:19.820 --> 01:06:21.820
Yeah, I did,

1088
01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:26.120
Yo, excuse me, Does anyone here
know a Jack Taylor?


1089
01:06:26.120 --> 01:06:27.520
Why?

1090
01:06:27.620 --> 01:06:31.420
This dude just called, said if I don't pick
him up at the train station in 15 minutes,


1091
01:06:31.420 --> 01:06:34.420
I'm out of a job, What do
you suppose that means?


1092
01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:35.620
Oh, my God,

1093
01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:37.720
That's what I thought,
'cause I ain't got no job,


1094
01:06:37.720 --> 01:06:39.620
- He's coming home early,
- OK, don't worry about it,


1095
01:06:39.720 --> 01:06:42.820
I'll take care of everything, OK?
Trust me, Just don't drive too fast,


1096
01:06:42.820 --> 01:06:44.220
Got it,

1097
01:06:44.220 --> 01:06:46.820
And, um, maybe you
should put that away,


1098
01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:50.320
Oh, God,

1099
01:07:40.920 --> 01:07:44.320
I knew that was you,

1100
01:09:09.820 --> 01:09:13.620
As long as we're in Thailand
for the meeting on Monday afternoon,


1101
01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:17.920
Yeah, We can pick it up
when we refuel in Hawaii,


1102
01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:21.420
Hey, uh, do you wanna stop
and, uh, get something to drink,


1103
01:09:21.420 --> 01:09:22.720
go to the bathroom or something?

1104
01:09:22.820 --> 01:09:24.920
We'll take the departmental heads now

1105
01:09:25.020 --> 01:09:28.320
and the Creative team
in a couple of weeks,


1106
01:09:37.820 --> 01:09:39.920
That's the agenda up to lunch,
then there's lunch...


1107
01:09:48.820 --> 01:09:52.620
OK, And then...

1108
01:10:01.220 --> 01:10:03.520
OK, fine,

1109
01:10:07.420 --> 01:10:12.220
- Stansfield, what are you doing?
- Nothing, sir,


1110
01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:15.020
Hold on a moment, please,

1111
01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:20.020
Stansfield... why don't you
just concentrate on the driving


1112
01:10:20.020 --> 01:10:23.020
and let me get
on with making my call,

1113
01:10:23.020 --> 01:10:25.720
- Wait!
- What is it now, Stansfield?


1114
01:10:25.820 --> 01:10:30.220
Oh, nothing, sir, Almost home,

1115
01:10:48.420 --> 01:10:52.720
- Hey, How'd this get in there?
- Oh, be careful with that,


1116
01:10:52.820 --> 01:10:54.720
I will, Good thing I found it,

1117
01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:57.720
There's several ways to properly
dispose of a handgun,


1118
01:10:57.820 --> 01:11:00.320
none of which include
putting it in a garbage bag,


1119
01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:03.420
Freeze! Police! Freeze!

1120
01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:05.420
Let go of the girl
and put your hands in the air!


1121
01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:07.320
You're completely surrounded, TJ!

1122
01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:09.920
Put down your weapons
and put your hands on you head!


1123
01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:15.320
No, you guys, Wait, He's not TJ,
I'm Lisa Taylor, This is my dad's house,


1124
01:11:15.420 --> 01:11:17.320
Ma'am, we've received
numerous reports


1125
01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:18.820
from this neighborhood: theft, gunfire...

1126
01:11:18.820 --> 01:11:23.120
All right, Look, I know you probably
think we may have killed somebody,


1127
01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:24.920
but Tom didn't know
he poisoned the guy,


1128
01:11:24.920 --> 01:11:28.920
and we thought he was dead when
we buried him, But he seems OK now,


1129
01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:32.420
His head's just a little bloody
from where we hit him with the shovel,


1130
01:11:32.420 --> 01:11:35.520
And I swear when Tom shot the gun off,
he didn't think it was loaded


1131
01:11:35.620 --> 01:11:39.020
'cause I put the bullets back in,
so if you'll all just step inside,


1132
01:11:39.020 --> 01:11:41.220
you'll see there's nobody dead here,

1133
01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:43.220
He may have had the wind
knocked out of him temporarily,


1134
01:11:43.320 --> 01:11:45.820
but with a little first aid,
I think he'll be just fine,


1135
01:11:55.620 --> 01:11:57.720
Holy mother of God!

1136
01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:01.520
Hans!

1137
01:12:01.620 --> 01:12:03.820
Yes, I see, I see,

1138
01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:05.920
OK, fine,

1139
01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:09.820
Could you say that again?
You're breaking up!


1140
01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:15.120
One moment, please, OJ!

1141
01:12:24.420 --> 01:12:29.320
I just can't understand why you would
do this, Hans, what were you thinking?


1142
01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:31.720
He'll be fine, He may complain
about a sore throat,


1143
01:12:31.820 --> 01:12:34.420
but he's in a lot better shape
than this chandelier,


1144
01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:35.920
Well, I'd hate to be here
when the owner gets back,


1145
01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:38.820
You can say that again,

1146
01:12:43.020 --> 01:12:44.420
- Tom! Daddy!
- What do we got?


1147
01:12:44.420 --> 01:12:46.620
- What was that?
- Watch the glass, OK, everybody?


1148
01:12:46.720 --> 01:12:48.720
- Let's get 'em out of the car,
- Oh, my God! Daddy!


1149
01:12:48.820 --> 01:12:51.020
- Everybody, stay back and remain calm,
- Are you all right?


1150
01:12:51.020 --> 01:12:53.320
That's him, That's the one spying
on me through the bushes,


1151
01:12:53.420 --> 01:12:55.520
He shot the bullet right through
my Julie's bedroom window,


1152
01:12:55.620 --> 01:12:58.720
Here, Tell 'em, Julie,

1153
01:12:59.420 --> 01:13:02.120
You guys, Tom wants the body in here,

1154
01:13:02.220 --> 01:13:04.720
Take it easy, Put me down,

1155
01:13:06.020 --> 01:13:09.520
Stansfield, what have you done?

1156
01:13:09.620 --> 01:13:13.220
Lisa, pack your things,
You're coming with me to Thailand,


1157
01:13:14.620 --> 01:13:17.720
No!

1158
01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:22.520
Get his ass out of here,

1159
01:13:22.620 --> 01:13:26.620
It's funny you should mention
the word "ass", Jack,


1160
01:13:26.620 --> 01:13:29.720
Why don't we start
by talking about yours,


1161
01:13:29.720 --> 01:13:30.720
Excuse me?

1162
01:13:30.820 --> 01:13:34.920
Lisa, your father is not
who you think he is,


1163
01:13:34.920 --> 01:13:39.720
The whole publishing operation,
It's a great cover,


1164
01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:43.720
Now how'd you do it? What'd you do?
Did you hollow out the books?


1165
01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:48.220
Oh, and locating the plant
in Thailand, It's genius!


1166
01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:53.520
- What are you talking about?
- What am l... Jack,


1167
01:13:53.620 --> 01:13:58.320
You know, I-I would've believed
you, Jack... until I met this man,


1168
01:13:58.420 --> 01:14:00.620
who seems to know a lot about ya,

1169
01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:07.920
Recognize this? I hear it's very
effective in relieving folliculitis,


1170
01:14:08.020 --> 01:14:11.220
I don't have folliculitis,

1171
01:14:11.220 --> 01:14:14.920
He's given me no choice,

1172
01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:16.820
- He's given me no choice!
- Tom, what are you doing?


1173
01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:19.620
- This is insane!
- Yeah? Take a look at your dad's ass,


1174
01:14:19.620 --> 01:14:21.420
- No!
- Then tell me I'm insane, huh?


1175
01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:26.020
Look at it!

1176
01:14:26.020 --> 01:14:28.620
Look at it!

1177
01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:30.620
What?

1178
01:14:35.420 --> 01:14:37.420
Oh, that's nasty,

1179
01:14:42.820 --> 01:14:48.320
I told you I don't have folliculitis,
you blithering idiot,


1180
01:14:48.420 --> 01:14:54.120
Well, guys, the ointment
must have worked,


1181
01:14:54.220 --> 01:14:56.320
Let's go,

1182
01:14:56.420 --> 01:15:00.720
Wait! I have something to show ya,

1183
01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:06.020
What's with this movie
and the ass cheeks?


1184
01:15:06.020 --> 01:15:11.320
My real name is Jack Taylor... Jr,
Red is my nickname,


1185
01:15:11.420 --> 01:15:15.320
Now you know why,
I'm the whole reason that TJ's here,


1186
01:15:15.420 --> 01:15:19.520
Goddamn it, Red, You've been
dealing drugs out of my house!


1187
01:15:19.620 --> 01:15:23.620
No, Dad, I swear,
I gave this guy a bag of flour,


1188
01:15:23.720 --> 01:15:27.020
I dumped a kilo of the real stuff
down the toilet,


1189
01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:29.220
I'm finished dealing for good,

1190
01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:32.420
The lime green toilet
with the wooden seat?


1191
01:15:33.220 --> 01:15:35.620
Yeah, why?

1192
01:15:48.220 --> 01:15:53.020
Wait a second, He's flying,

1193
01:15:53.020 --> 01:15:55.920
He's flying,

1194
01:16:15.520 --> 01:16:21.220
Get him out of my sight, Now,
Lisa, let's go,


1195
01:16:23.420 --> 01:16:26.020
That's the one, He got my ear!
Evander Holyfield's ear,


1196
01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:28.820
You have to right to remain silent,
Anything you say can and...


1197
01:16:28.920 --> 01:16:30.720
Lisa, wait!

1198
01:16:30.820 --> 01:16:33.520
That's Holyfield's ear
for God's sake,


1199
01:16:59.420 --> 01:17:04.720
OJ! Come to Daddy,
How's my little boy?


1200
01:17:18.020 --> 01:17:24.620
- You're going with him?
- What choice do I have? He needs me,


1201
01:17:24.620 --> 01:17:27.320
Are you actually feeling sorry for him?

1202
01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:30.920
He's manipulating you
and you are buying it,


1203
01:17:31.820 --> 01:17:35.620
All right, fine, You do what you gotta do,
I am gonna bail Tom out of jail,


1204
01:17:35.720 --> 01:17:36.820
With what? Your drug money?

1205
01:17:36.920 --> 01:17:38.920
No, no, no, I stole
this out of Dad's safe,

1206
01:17:39.020 --> 01:17:42.020
Look, the important thing is,
somebody has gotta help Tom,


1207
01:17:42.120 --> 01:17:45.820
You know that nothing that happened
here last night was any of his fault,


1208
01:17:45.820 --> 01:17:50.320
It's funny, The nicest guy in the world's
the only one with enough balls


1209
01:17:50.420 --> 01:17:52.720
to stand up to Dad,

1210
01:17:56.020 --> 01:18:00.320
All he wanted to do was
to spend some time with you,


1211
01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:02.520
Look what it gets him,

1212
01:18:02.620 --> 01:18:07.420
Classic Dad, I'm not allowed in the
house, you're not allowed out of it,


1213
01:18:07.520 --> 01:18:10.920
He doesn't care about us,
Only that stupid bird,


1214
01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:16.020
- Hey, Red, can I tell you something?
- Sure,


1215
01:18:16.120 --> 01:18:20.620
I know this is gonna sound weird,
but ever since I was a little kid...


1216
01:18:22.820 --> 01:18:27.620
I used to always wish
that I was that stupid bird,


1217
01:18:37.820 --> 01:18:41.320
Look, I think it's about time
you talk to Dad,


1218
01:18:41.420 --> 01:18:45.220
At least tell him how you feel,
You can do it,


1219
01:18:49.620 --> 01:18:53.320
Don't you see, we have no reason
to be afraid of him?


1220
01:19:07.420 --> 01:19:12.220
- Daddy!
- Lisa, don't let him do this to you,


1221
01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:16.520
Lisa! Aah!

1222
01:19:37.020 --> 01:19:40.220
- Lisa! 
- Tom!

1223
01:19:40.320 --> 01:19:44.020
Red bailed me out... and told me you
were here and I'm not letting you go,


1224
01:19:44.120 --> 01:19:46.620
- Yeah, but I'm...
- No, You're gonna let me finish,


1225
01:19:46.720 --> 01:19:50.120
I went through hell last night and it was
my fault 'cause I let people do it to me,


1226
01:19:50.220 --> 01:19:51.920
And now you're gonna
make the same mistake,


1227
01:19:52.020 --> 01:19:53.720
- Yeah, but...
- This isn't what you want,


1228
01:19:53.820 --> 01:19:56.820
This is what your father wants,
And you know what?


1229
01:19:56.920 --> 01:20:03.020
Maybe you and l... never
are gonna work, And that hurts,


1230
01:20:03.020 --> 01:20:07.320
But not as much as watching you
be controlled by a ruthless tyrant


1231
01:20:07.320 --> 01:20:09.920
that would screw his own mother
if he thought it'd help him get ahead...


1232
01:20:10.020 --> 01:20:20.020
Tom! I'm not going,

1233
01:20:21.520 --> 01:20:23.520
She's-she's not going,

1234
01:20:26.720 --> 01:20:30.720
Is this whole concept too complicated
for you, Stansfield?


1235
01:20:41.020 --> 01:20:45.120
No, No,

1236
01:20:45.220 --> 01:20:47.820
All right,

1237
01:20:47.920 --> 01:20:51.220
Wha... I... What made you stay?

1238
01:20:59.320 --> 01:21:01.320
That,

1239
01:21:08.120 --> 01:21:14.120
- How did you guys...
- We finally had our long overdue talk,


1240
01:21:14.920 --> 01:21:17.820
Then-then who's taking
your place in Thailand?


1241
01:21:17.920 --> 01:21:19.520
He is,

1242
01:21:19.620 --> 01:21:20.920
What's this?

1243
01:21:21.020 --> 01:21:24.220
- I'm kidding,
- I don't wanna go, I'm afraid,


1244
01:21:24.320 --> 01:21:27.320
Nonsense, Everyone knows that, uh...

1245
01:21:27.420 --> 01:21:30.720
Asian people are very
intimidated by, uh...


1246
01:21:30.820 --> 01:21:32.820
- Tall men?
- Canadians?


1247
01:21:32.920 --> 01:21:35.620
- Republicans?
- Blacks?


1248
01:21:35.720 --> 01:21:37.520
- Henderson?
- Yes, sir,


1249
01:21:37.620 --> 01:21:39.320
I won't have that kind of thinking
in this company,


1250
01:21:39.320 --> 01:21:42.220
There's no room for racism here,
You're fired,


1251
01:21:42.320 --> 01:21:47.020
Now, Tom, the point that I'm getting to
is that with a big part of the team away,


1252
01:21:47.120 --> 01:21:49.920
I'm gonna want you to take over
the Creative Department,


1253
01:21:49.920 --> 01:21:52.220
- Me?
- No need to be modest,


1254
01:21:52.220 --> 01:21:55.320
I saw those ideas you left
in the living room,


1255
01:21:55.420 --> 01:22:00.220
Your theory on the JFK thing, brilliant,
And the moon landing, a hoax?


1256
01:22:00.220 --> 01:22:02.320
You're really on to something there,

1257
01:22:02.420 --> 01:22:06.420
That's the kind of thinking
that's gonna sell books,


1258
01:22:06.520 --> 01:22:10.420
Thank you, sir,

1259
01:22:10.520 --> 01:22:14.120
Bye, Daddy, Have a safe flight,

1260
01:22:17.620 --> 01:22:22.120
Well, Dad... that's fantastic,
You promoted Tom,


1261
01:22:22.220 --> 01:22:25.720
Yeah, well, I figure anyone who's got
the guts to piss on my Persian carpet


1262
01:22:25.820 --> 01:22:30.620
has gotta have what it takes,
Stansfield!


1263
01:22:36.020 --> 01:22:41.320
- What the hell are you doing?
- Just trying to get my job back, sir,


1264
01:22:46.320 --> 01:22:50.320
You know, after everything
that happened, after all I went through,


1265
01:22:50.320 --> 01:22:54.320
I guess it was my lucky day.
And I'm not the only one.


1266
01:22:54.320 --> 01:22:56.420
Based on Lisa and Red's suggestions,

1267
01:22:56.520 --> 01:22:59.120
Jack restructured the company
from top to bottom.


1268
01:22:59.120 --> 01:23:02.820
Even instituting casual
Fridays every day.


1269
01:23:02.820 --> 01:23:06.120
And last Friday was Henderson's

1270
01:23:06.120 --> 01:23:07.620
without being fired.

1271
01:23:07.720 --> 01:23:10.720
OJ's back off the drugs
and now he only drinks beer.


1272
01:23:12.820 --> 01:23:15.520
But he still has
an occasional flashback.


1273
01:23:18.220 --> 01:23:20.720
Jack begged Audrey to come back,
but she got a job


1274
01:23:20.720 --> 01:23:22.720
at, of all places, a coffee shop.

1275
01:23:29.020 --> 01:23:31.820
This is terrible!

1276
01:23:31.820 --> 01:23:35.520
Hans succeeded in turning around
the company's factory in Thailand.


1277
01:23:35.520 --> 01:23:38.020
But apparently he's still struggling
to cope with the local customs.


1278
01:23:38.120 --> 01:23:40.520
- Back of bus!
- Excuse me?


1279
01:23:40.520 --> 01:23:43.920
- You people belong back of bus,
- That's an outrage!


1280
01:23:44.020 --> 01:23:46.920
Man, I'm not gonna let you treat me
like that merely because I'm...


1281
01:23:46.920 --> 01:23:49.820
Smoking! Smokers belong back of bus!

1282
01:23:52.920 --> 01:23:55.120
As for me, with my new promotion,

1283
01:23:55.220 --> 01:23:58.220
I could at last write books
based on my own experiences.


1284
01:23:58.220 --> 01:23:59.720
- So I did.
- Thank you,


1285
01:23:59.720 --> 01:24:03.520
And Lisa was finally able to pursue
a career that she loved.


1286
01:24:03.620 --> 01:24:06.420
You know, you ever heard
someone say that old expression.:


1287
01:24:06.520 --> 01:24:09.720
"Why does everything bad
always happen to me?"


1288
01:24:09.820 --> 01:24:13.820
Well, I don't get those people...
'cause I've learned that if they just stop


1289
01:24:13.820 --> 01:24:20.620
and look around, they'd realize
that everything happens for a reason.


1290
01:29:56.820 --> 01:30:00.720
I told him he'd see
the ass sooner or later.
