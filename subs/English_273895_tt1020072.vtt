1
00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.561
<i>I accept this honor for our lost ones,</i>

2
00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.156
<i>whose deaths pave our path.</i>

3
00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.397
And for the 20 million
Negro men and women


4
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.158
motivated by dignity
and a disdain for hopelessness.


5
00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.236
This isn't right.

6
00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:16.391
Corrie.

7
00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.041
This ain't right.

8
00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:19.316
What's that?

9
00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.476
This necktie. It's not right.

10
00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.760
Well, it's not a necktie, dear.
It's an ascot.


11
00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.880
Yes, but generally the same principles
should apply, shouldn't they?


12
00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.514
It's not right.

13
00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:35.679
It's not right, or you don't like it?

14
00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.912
I don't like how this looks.

15
00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.561
Looks distinguished and debonair
to me.


16
00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.076
You know what I mean.

17
00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.194
Like we're living high on the hog.

18
00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.116
Dressed like this
while folks back home are...


19
00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.033
It's not right.

20
00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.359
Wait till the brothers back home
see me like this.


21
00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:59.761
They'll have a good laugh.

22
00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.157
Let them laugh.

23
00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:06.280
It's not a crime to be away
for a few days, Martin.


24
00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.036
It's nice being away, huh?

25
00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:14.235
Yeah. It really is.

26
00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:16.831
Look here.

27
00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.038
I'm gonna be a pastor
somewhere small.


28
00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.155
College town.

29
00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.960
Lead a little church. 
Teach a class.

30
00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.878
Maybe the occasional
speaking engagement.


31
00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.400
And I'll pay all the bills for us,

32
00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.679
especially the mortgage
for our very own house.


33
00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.680
Perfect.

34
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.714
You look handsome.

35
00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:03.913
<i>Through it all,</i>

36
00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:09.121
Martin Luther King has
spoken of his dream.


37
00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.394
One which we

38
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.759
and many other people
around the world share.


39
00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:22.435
To this undeterred hero for justice,

40
00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.071
the Nobel Committee of Oslo, Norway,

41
00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:31.600
awards our 1964 Peace Prize.

42
00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.796
<i>I accept this honor for our lost ones,</i>

43
00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:55.034
<i>whose deaths pave our path.</i>

44
00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:00.276
<i>I accept this honor for the more than

45
00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:03.399
<i>who are motivated by dignity.</i>

46
00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.077
<i>Together we believe that
what the illusion</i>


47
00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.471
<i>of supremacy has destroyed,</i>

48
00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.074
<i>the truth of equality can nourish.</i>

49
00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.517
I promise you.
It ain't nothing to be scared of.


50
00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.712
It's quick.
And the pastor is right there next to you.


51
00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:21.270
Yeah, but the biggest thing
is getting your hair wet up.


52
00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:22.761
I got my hair pressed that same morning

53
00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.912
and it was wasted
as soon as I hit the water.


54
00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.913
I should have worn a swim cap
like Mama said.


55
00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:29.236
See, I asked my mama

56
00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.790
could she make my hair like
Coretta Scott King had hers


57
00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.440
at the Washington March.

58
00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:35.160
But she said that was too grown.

59
00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:36.595
Oh, I love her hair.

60
00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:39.355
I heard she don't even put rollers in it.
It's just like that.


61
00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.751
But I studied it. 
I know how she do it.

62
00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.992
See, she parts in the middle and then...

63
00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:42.671
Annie Lee Cooper!

64
00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:50.677
Get on up now. 
I ain't got all day.

65
00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:08.631
You work for Mr. Dunn
down at the rest home, ain't that right?


66
00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:11.516
Yes.

67
00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:13.840
Wonder what old Dunn'll say
when I tell him


68
00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:16.800
one of his gals is down here
stirring a fuss.


69
00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:21.239
I ain't stirring no fuss.
I'm just here trying to register to vote.


70
00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:26.796
It's all right this time.

71
00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:28.759
It's right when I say it's right.

72
00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:36.591
Recite the Constitution's preamble.
Know what a preamble is?


73
00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:48.840
"We the people of the United States,

74
00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:52.641
"in order to form a more perfect union,

75
00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:56.996
"establish justice,

76
00:07:57.710 --> 00:08:00.475
"ensure domestic tranquility,

77
00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:05.360
"provide for the common defense,
promote the general welfare..."


78
00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:08.274
How many county judges in Alabama?

79
00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:14.520
Sixty-seven.

80
00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:20.400
Name them.

81
00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:50.675
<i>Aren't we done?
Are we not done with this?</i>


82
00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:53.031
- Will this ever end?
- I don't know, Mr. President.


83
00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:55.158
A comprehensive plan
is already in place.


84
00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:57.881
The act was only passed
six months ago.


85
00:08:57.950 --> 00:09:01.921
So hammer home that
impatience only hurts the overall cause.


86
00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:05.358
We're... We're getting there.
Just... Just keep reiterating the plan.


87
00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:06.756
No, he doesn't want reiteration.

88
00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:10.437
He wants something so he can say,
"Look, I told you I had a dream


89
00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:12.877
"and it's all coming goddamn true,
whether you like it or not!"


90
00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:14.600
That's what he wants.

91
00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:16.991
What he needs to do
is get on board with what we're doing


92
00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:19.232
instead of the other way around.
For once!


93
00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:23.636
Mr. President, Dr. King.

94
00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:25.434
Mr. President.

95
00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:27.160
Dr. King.

96
00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:30.876
Well, I'll tell you.
I'm a tall son-of-a-bitch,


97
00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:34.272
but this close to the new Nobel laureate

98
00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:36.751
and with all those other trinkets
you've been collecting lately,


99
00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:38.639
I feel tits-high to a puppy dog.

100
00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:40.720
Well, thank you, Mr. President.

101
00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:42.711
Mr. White.

102
00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:44.076
- Dr. King.
- All right.


103
00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:47.597
I'll tell you, ending segregation,

104
00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:50.992
proudest moment of my life
when I signed that '64 Act.


105
00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:54.715
Proudest moment of my life, I tell you.

106
00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:56.633
Now civil rights is a priority

107
00:09:56.710 --> 00:09:58.758
- of this administration as you know.
- Thank you.


108
00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:00.036
We're gonna face the challenge,

109
00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:03.472
or this country is
storing up a heap of trouble for itself.


110
00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:07.600
Now, seeing as I can't convince you to
work with my administration


111
00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:11.152
in an official capacity
inside the White House,


112
00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:12.630
I feel damn fortunate

113
00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:14.394
to have someone
as statesmanlike as you


114
00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:15.471
leading the movement.

115
00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:17.439
And I want you to go on leading it.
No one else.


116
00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:20.559
Not one of these
militant Malcolm X types.


117
00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:25.637
So... I wanna help. Tell me how.

118
00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:29.479
Well, Mr. President,

119
00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:33.441
I'm here to speak
specifically about the denial


120
00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:36.878
of a basic American right
for the Negro citizen.


121
00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:39.239
The right to vote.

122
00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:43.512
Well... Technically...

123
00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:47.481
Technically, we already have it.
Yes, Mr. President.


124
00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:50.679
But, we both know in the South

125
00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:54.471
black voters are kept off the rolls
and out of the voting booths


126
00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:59.078
by systematic intimidation
and fear, Mr. President.


127
00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:03.354
Now, you asked how you can help.

128
00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:06.596
We want Federal legislation

129
00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:10.516
granting Negroes the right
to vote unencumbered.


130
00:11:10.590 --> 00:11:14.037
And we want Federal
protocol eliminating


131
00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:16.681
the decades-long dismissal

132
00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:20.118
and illegal denial
of blacks seeking to vote.


133
00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:24.030
And we want
robust enforcement of that protocol.


134
00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:30.034
Well... That's fine.

135
00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:34.911
But... Most of the South
is still not desegregating.


136
00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:37.596
Let's not start another battle
when we haven't even won the first.


137
00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:42.553
And you know what
the next battle should be?


138
00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:45.150
The eradication of poverty.

139
00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:47.673
I'm calling it "The War on Poverty."

140
00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:52.673
It's a matter of political priorities.

141
00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:56.800
Poverty is going to be my focus at home
and I want you to help me with this.


142
00:11:57.670 --> 00:11:59.832
We can make big changes
in these things


143
00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:01.560
for people of all colors.

144
00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:03.951
And I know that matters to you,
doesn't it?


145
00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:06.271
This voting thing
is just gonna have to wait.


146
00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:14.395
It...

147
00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:17.599
It can't wait, Mr. President.

148
00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:18.671
Well, why not?

149
00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:20.918
Because there have been thousands

150
00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:23.391
of racially motivated murders
in the South,


151
00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:25.916
including those four girls.

152
00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:27.071
Well, I know that...

153
00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:29.756
And you know the astounding fact

154
00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:34.711
that not one of these criminals
who murder us when and why they want


155
00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:36.440
has ever been convicted.

156
00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:38.194
Yeah, I know we have a lot
of work to do down there.


157
00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:39.920
Not one conviction

158
00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:43.039
because they are protected
by white officials


159
00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:45.636
chosen by an all-white electorate.

160
00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:48.554
And on the rare occasions
that they face trial,


161
00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:51.634
they are freed by all-white juries.

162
00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:56.750
All-white because
you can't serve on a jury


163
00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:59.350
unless you are registered to vote.

164
00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:07.199
Well, Dr. King, you've certainly given me
something to think about.


165
00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:10.956
But this administration is going to
set this aside for a while.


166
00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:13.397
Just for a while, you understand.

167
00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:20.677
Yes, Mr. President, I... I understand.

168
00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:31.154
Selma it is.

169
00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:48.714
Big speech lined up
for these folks tonight, Doc?


170
00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:53.356
We need to see what's what first,
Big Fellow.


171
00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:55.831
We're just here to test the waters.

172
00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:59.278
Oh, my Lord.
What you got us into, woman?


173
00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:05.678
We've got 128 miles
to come to our senses, gentlemen.


174
00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:06.990
Hush.

175
00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:09.801
This here is the
place we need to be.

176
00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:12.521
This right here is the next great battle.

177
00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:15.358
I can only imagine.

178
00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:21.679
Decent-looking place to die though.

179
00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:47.871
Ms. Nash.

180
00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:49.476
Mr. Bevel.

181
00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:53.839
Doc? This here is it. 
Selma's the place.

182
00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:58.079
A lot of groundwork has already
been laid by the people here.


183
00:14:58.150 --> 00:14:59.151
And they ready.

184
00:15:18.390 --> 00:15:20.631
- Sister Boynton.
- Mr. Orange.


185
00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:29.161
Good afternoon.

186
00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:36.838
Dr. King?

187
00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:39.831
May I introduce myself?

188
00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:42.159
Yeah, of course.

189
00:15:44.350 --> 00:15:45.397
Hey!

190
00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:50.361
It's okay. It's okay. I'm okay.

191
00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:54.476
This way, Dr. King.

192
00:15:59.670 --> 00:16:01.718
That white boy can hit.

193
00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:03.121
This place is perfect.

194
00:16:03.190 --> 00:16:06.672
What's the FBI's current information
on Martin Luther King?


195
00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:09.631
I heard he was assaulted in Selma.

196
00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:13.635
My information can be
summed up in a few words.


197
00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:17.840
King is a political and moral degenerate.

198
00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:21.631
Well, you say that, J. Edgar.
I have to take it seriously.


199
00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:24.919
But if he's a degenerate,
what I do know is,


200
00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:27.152
he's a non-violent degenerate.

201
00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:30.154
And I want him to go on leading
the civil rights movement,


202
00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:33.234
not one of these bloodthirsty militants.

203
00:16:33.310 --> 00:16:37.235
What I need to know right now is
what's he about to do next?


204
00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:39.561
Mr. President,

205
00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:45.159
you know we can
shut men with power down


206
00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:49.155
permanently and unequivocally.

207
00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:55.719
I'm very aware of that, Mr. Director.

208
00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:04.841
Well, if you prefer a different approach,

209
00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:08.434
we can go with the wife.

210
00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:15.600
We know there's tension
in the home already.


211
00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:20.797
We can weaken the dynamic.

212
00:17:23.590 --> 00:17:25.354
Dismantle the family.

213
00:17:55.790 --> 00:17:56.791
Hello.

214
00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:58.838
<i>You ain't got long.</i>

215
00:17:59.190 --> 00:18:03.479
<i>When the hearts of those Pickaninnies
of yours stop beating...</i>


216
00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:09.319
Same thing?

217
00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:13.550
When are you all heading out?

218
00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:18.836
We're heading back to Selma
at 5:00 a.m.


219
00:18:18.910 --> 00:18:22.119
It turned out to be
an ideal staging ground.


220
00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:28.198
There's a full couple of weeks planned.

221
00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:31.160
Quite a bit to be done.

222
00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:36.875
I see.

223
00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:46.560
That highway is nice now.
Get you there in a couple of hours.


224
00:18:55.390 --> 00:18:58.121
Good people in those parts though.

225
00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:06.596
Well...

226
00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:11.955
I'm worried about the ones
who ain't so good.


227
00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:18.917
This local Sheriff Jim Clark
is supposed to be bad business.


228
00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:22.552
Won't go down without a fight, they say.

229
00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:27.601
And since we don't fight...

230
00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:29.595
Well...

231
00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:33.241
As good a place to
die as any, I guess.

232
00:19:36.670 --> 00:19:38.638
I wish you wouldn't talk like that.

233
00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:45.352
It just takes the edge off.

234
00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:49.553
You and your friends
can joke about that.


235
00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:51.758
I don't joke about that.

236
00:19:55.550 --> 00:19:58.554
You're right. I'm sorry.

237
00:20:01.030 --> 00:20:04.273
I'll put these things away
in your bag now.


238
00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:07.399
I didn't realize
you were leaving so early.


239
00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:55.960
Hello?

240
00:20:56.030 --> 00:20:57.156
<i>Halie?</i>

241
00:20:57.950 --> 00:20:59.600
<i>Martin.</i>

242
00:21:01.550 --> 00:21:04.076
I need to hear the Lord's voice.

243
00:21:08.190 --> 00:21:12.036
Surely, Martin. Surely.

244
00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:28.679
<i>Precious Lord</i>

245
00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:34.193
<i>Take my hand</i>

246
00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:42.235
<i>Lead me home</i>

247
00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:47.751
<i>Let me stand</i>

248
00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:55.079
<i>I am tired</i>

249
00:21:56.790 --> 00:22:01.432
<i>I am weak</i>

250
00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:09.553
<i>I am worn</i>

251
00:22:12.670 --> 00:22:19.315
<i>Through the storm</i>

252
00:22:19.910 --> 00:22:26.919
<i>Through the night</i>

253
00:22:29.790 --> 00:22:36.674
<i>Lord, lead me on</i>

254
00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:39.511
<i>To the light</i>

255
00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:43.994
- Hey!
- Hey!


256
00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:45.560
- Sully.
- Look at you.


257
00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:49.037
- Morning, Doctor.
- Good morning, Doctor.


258
00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:51.716
- Drive all right?
- Good and long.


259
00:22:51.790 --> 00:22:54.714
Good news is Richie Jean is in there.

260
00:22:54.790 --> 00:22:57.191
Oh, she's ready for you.

261
00:22:57.830 --> 00:23:00.310
Negro, that's all you had to say.

262
00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:03.280
Uncle Marty!

263
00:23:03.390 --> 00:23:05.631
There she is! There's our girl!

264
00:23:06.430 --> 00:23:08.751
Hey, Richie Jean!

265
00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:12.279
- Looking like her mom.
- You go play.


266
00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:14.876
- Hey!
- Hey, Ralphy.


267
00:23:16.110 --> 00:23:17.600
- How you doing?
- Hey!


268
00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:18.717
Good to see you, sweetheart.

269
00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:20.280
Hey, come over here.

270
00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:23.475
Oh, Lord, it's good to see this!

271
00:23:23.550 --> 00:23:25.632
Okay, now, I've got the grits
on the stove.


272
00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:27.678
How many we expecting today?

273
00:23:27.790 --> 00:23:30.031
Well, now, Sister Jackson.

274
00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:32.716
You know about our group,
the SCLC, right?


275
00:23:32.790 --> 00:23:34.758
The Southern Christian
Leadership Conference?


276
00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:37.276
A few of our top SCLC leaders
are with us this time


277
00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:40.797
since we're going to be here
a little longer than expected.


278
00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:42.880
Now, this here's Reverend C.T. Vivian.

279
00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:44.679
He coordinates all the SCLC branches.

280
00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:47.435
Welcome. Nice to meet you.
Welcome, welcome.


281
00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:49.353
This is Reverend James Bevel.

282
00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:51.478
- How you doing, ma'am?
- I'm well. Thank you.


283
00:23:51.550 --> 00:23:53.075
This here is James Orange.

284
00:23:53.190 --> 00:23:54.601
Oh, this is a big one.

285
00:23:54.670 --> 00:23:56.160
I don't know if I've got enough
to feed you.


286
00:23:56.230 --> 00:23:57.720
Well, let's find out. 
How about that?

287
00:23:57.790 --> 00:23:58.837
Hey!

288
00:23:58.910 --> 00:24:01.038
Now, you got two of them
named James.


289
00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:02.271
Oh, you can call me Jim, Sister.

290
00:24:02.350 --> 00:24:03.476
And Orange is fine with me, ma'am.

291
00:24:03.550 --> 00:24:04.756
Or Big Fellow!

292
00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:06.759
All right. Well, this is fine with me.

293
00:24:06.910 --> 00:24:09.993
Mrs. Jackson. Hosea Williams.

294
00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:11.310
Or Castro!

295
00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:14.121
Oh, yeah, that's a long story.

296
00:24:14.190 --> 00:24:17.194
Those grits, they need some stirring.
Mind?


297
00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:18.795
You put your foot in it now.

298
00:24:19.230 --> 00:24:21.039
Ain't you supposed to be on a diet?

299
00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:23.471
Somebody call Juanita.

300
00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:26.840
- There's a phone!
- Hey, get off that phone.


301
00:24:26.910 --> 00:24:27.957
Juanita?

302
00:24:28.110 --> 00:24:30.351
<i>Don't do it, Doc. 
Don't do it...</i>

303
00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:36.158
Turning in, Doc. You okay?

304
00:24:36.990 --> 00:24:39.561
Yes, sir. Good night to you.

305
00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:47.273
I wanted to tell you that
the students are in town.


306
00:24:49.910 --> 00:24:51.196
Local students?

307
00:24:51.310 --> 00:24:53.074
Oh, no.

308
00:24:54.670 --> 00:24:57.071
The Student Non-Violent
Coordinating Committee.


309
00:24:58.190 --> 00:25:01.751
Okay. Our young friends at SNCC.

310
00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:04.671
Good to know.

311
00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:06.912
You the one told them to organize.

312
00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:09.511
Took it to heart.

313
00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:13.518
Don't be surprised
if they don't give us grief tomorrow.


314
00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:16.275
Town folk may be happy to see us.
But SNCC?


315
00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:19.116
They feel we're in their territory.

316
00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:23.320
They're young and full of spirit.

317
00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:25.401
Not a bad thing.

318
00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:29.159
It'll sort out.

319
00:25:31.870 --> 00:25:33.360
Good night.

320
00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:37.001
Good night.

321
00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:45.034
"Boycotting the buses in Montgomery.

322
00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:47.317
"Segregation in Birmingham."

323
00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:50.951
<i>Boycotting the buses in Montgomery.</i>

324
00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:56.640
<i>Segregation in Birmingham.</i>

325
00:25:58.230 --> 00:26:01.951
<i>Now? Voting in Selma.</i>

326
00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:08.119
<i>One struggle ends just to go
right to the next and the next.</i>


327
00:26:10.110 --> 00:26:13.114
<i>If you think of it that way,
it's a hard road.</i>


328
00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:17.401
<i>But I don't think of it that way.</i>

329
00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:20.235
<i>I think of these efforts as one effort.</i>

330
00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:23.120
<i>And that one effort is for our life.</i>

331
00:26:24.990 --> 00:26:29.598
<i>Our life as a community.
Our life as a nation.</i>


332
00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:32.153
<i>For our lives.</i>

333
00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:38.921
<i>We can do this.</i>

334
00:26:41.670 --> 00:26:43.195
<i>We must do this!</i>

335
00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:49.037
<i>We see children</i>

336
00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:51.875
<i>become victims of one
of the most vicious crimes</i>


337
00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:56.433
<i>ever perpetrated against humanity
within the walls of their own church!</i>


338
00:26:58.430 --> 00:27:01.400
<i>They are sainted now.</i>

339
00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:04.792
<i>They are the sainted ones
in this quest for freedom.</i>


340
00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:07.555
<i>And they speak to us still.</i>

341
00:27:07.630 --> 00:27:11.794
<i>They say to us, to all of us,
all colors and creeds,</i>


342
00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:14.760
<i>that we must do this.</i>

343
00:27:15.190 --> 00:27:20.196
<i>They say to us that it is unacceptable</i>

344
00:27:20.270 --> 00:27:23.638
<i>for more than 50%
of Selma to be Negro</i>

345
00:27:23.710 --> 00:27:27.237
<i>and yet less than 2% of Negroes here
being able to vote</i>


346
00:27:27.310 --> 00:27:30.314
<i>and determine their own destiny
as human beings.</i>


347
00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:37.520
<i>They say to us that
the local white leadership</i>


348
00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:40.992
<i>use their power to
keep us away from the ballot box</i>


349
00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:42.754
<i>and keep us voiceless.</i>

350
00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:50.198
<i>As long as I am unable to exercise
my constitutional right to vote,</i>


351
00:27:50.510 --> 00:27:53.241
<i>I do not have
command of my own life.</i>

352
00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:56.837
<i>I cannot determine my own destiny
for it is determined for me</i>


353
00:27:56.910 --> 00:28:00.153
<i>by people who would rather
see me suffer than succeed.</i>


354
00:28:00.910 --> 00:28:04.312
<i>Those that have gone before us say,
"No more!"</i>


355
00:28:04.390 --> 00:28:05.630
No more! No more!

356
00:28:05.710 --> 00:28:07.280
<i>No more!</i>

357
00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:11.150
<i>That means protest, that means march,</i>

358
00:28:11.230 --> 00:28:15.474
<i>that means disturb the peace,
that means jail,</i>


359
00:28:15.550 --> 00:28:17.951
<i>that means risk! 
And that is hard!</i>

360
00:28:20.430 --> 00:28:23.081
<i>We will not wait any longer.</i>

361
00:28:23.150 --> 00:28:25.152
<i>Give us the vote!</i>

362
00:28:25.230 --> 00:28:26.800
That's right! No more!

363
00:28:27.190 --> 00:28:29.352
<i>We're not asking. 
We're demanding.</i>

364
00:28:29.430 --> 00:28:30.636
<i>Give us the vote!</i>

365
00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:31.836
Give us the vote!

366
00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:45.471
Dr. King.
Roy Reed of <i>The New York Times.</i>


367
00:28:45.550 --> 00:28:47.552
Yes. Hello to you. How are you?

368
00:28:47.630 --> 00:28:49.951
I'm well, sir. 
Thank you for asking.

369
00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:54.917
Dr. King, are you truly non-violent
if you are provoking violence, sir?


370
00:28:54.990 --> 00:28:57.994
We are here,
using our very bodies in protest


371
00:28:58.070 --> 00:28:59.913
- to say to those who deny us...
- Dr. King. Dr. King.


372
00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:00.991
Pleasure, sir.

373
00:29:01.070 --> 00:29:03.835
...that we will no longer let them
use their billy clubs


374
00:29:03.910 --> 00:29:06.754
in dark corners and halls of power.

375
00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:09.595
We make them do it
in the glaring light of day, Mr. Reed.


376
00:29:09.670 --> 00:29:11.638
Is SNCC standing with us
on this or not, gentlemen?


377
00:29:11.710 --> 00:29:12.836
You want us to bring our people in,

378
00:29:12.910 --> 00:29:14.071
but you're not giving anything in return.

379
00:29:14.150 --> 00:29:16.596
Now we are asking
for some kind of commitment here.


380
00:29:16.670 --> 00:29:18.638
Respectfully speaking, of course,

381
00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:20.678
we've been handling
the voter registration


382
00:29:20.790 --> 00:29:22.554
in this town now for two years.

383
00:29:22.630 --> 00:29:24.997
Well, you haven't gotten very far,
have you?


384
00:29:26.270 --> 00:29:28.796
Well, maybe not, Reverend.
But we're still here.


385
00:29:28.870 --> 00:29:29.871
Meaning what?

386
00:29:29.950 --> 00:29:31.475
This time next month, you won't be!

387
00:29:31.550 --> 00:29:33.712
- That's insanity!
- Just like you left Albany.


388
00:29:33.790 --> 00:29:35.235
Those people are pathetic
down there now.


389
00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:36.471
Like they daddy left home!

390
00:29:36.550 --> 00:29:38.678
What we're trying
to explain is that in Albany you all...


391
00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:41.594
You know what I think?
Maybe we should just leave Selma...


392
00:29:41.670 --> 00:29:43.752
Now! Leave it to these two.

393
00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:46.071
Come back in another two years
and see how much further you got!


394
00:29:46.150 --> 00:29:47.959
- Sounds just fine to me.
- That's enough.


395
00:29:50.070 --> 00:29:51.071
Enough of this now.

396
00:29:54.030 --> 00:29:56.761
I haven't the time for this.
None of us got the time for this.


397
00:29:59.390 --> 00:30:00.915
John.

398
00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:02.961
James.

399
00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:07.711
The way our organization works
is straightforward.


400
00:30:07.790 --> 00:30:12.000
We negotiate. We demonstrate.
We resist.


401
00:30:12.470 --> 00:30:17.636
And on our best days, our adversary
helps the matter by making a mistake.


402
00:30:17.710 --> 00:30:22.193
Now, we were in Albany for nine months
and we made a lot of mistakes.


403
00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:25.356
But their sheriff, 
Laurie Pritchett,

404
00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:27.593
he never made a mistake.

405
00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:31.078
Kept his cool,
kept arresting us in a humane way,


406
00:30:31.150 --> 00:30:34.597
carried people to
the jail-wagons on stretchers.


407
00:30:34.670 --> 00:30:36.752
Day in, day out.

408
00:30:37.190 --> 00:30:38.157
There was no drama.

409
00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:39.755
You mean there was no cameras.

410
00:30:43.030 --> 00:30:44.031
Exactly.

411
00:30:45.470 --> 00:30:48.360
Now I know, we all understand,
that you young people


412
00:30:48.430 --> 00:30:51.240
believe in working
in the community long-term.


413
00:30:51.310 --> 00:30:55.156
Doing the good work
to raise black consciousness.


414
00:30:56.870 --> 00:30:58.952
It's good grassroots work.

415
00:30:59.030 --> 00:31:03.240
I can't tell you
how much we admire that.


416
00:31:04.390 --> 00:31:06.358
But what we do

417
00:31:06.430 --> 00:31:08.353
is negotiate,

418
00:31:08.430 --> 00:31:10.000
demonstrate,

419
00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:11.151
resist.

420
00:31:11.270 --> 00:31:13.318
And a big part of that

421
00:31:13.390 --> 00:31:16.519
is raising white consciousness.

422
00:31:16.590 --> 00:31:17.921
And in particular the consciousness

423
00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:19.754
of whichever white man
happens to be sitting


424
00:31:19.830 --> 00:31:20.831
in the Oval Office.

425
00:31:21.550 --> 00:31:26.033
Right now, Johnson has other fish to fry
and he'll ignore us if he can.


426
00:31:27.150 --> 00:31:29.801
The only way to stop him doing that

427
00:31:29.870 --> 00:31:32.601
is by being on the front page
of the national press every morning


428
00:31:33.270 --> 00:31:37.036
and by being on the TV news
every night.


429
00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:39.158
And that requires

430
00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:41.151
drama.

431
00:31:42.630 --> 00:31:43.791
Now...

432
00:31:46.350 --> 00:31:47.556
John.

433
00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:51.115
James.

434
00:31:51.190 --> 00:31:52.919
Answer me one question.

435
00:31:54.190 --> 00:31:58.912
I've been told the sheriff in this town
isn't like Laurie Pritchett in Albany.


436
00:31:58.990 --> 00:32:03.279
He's a big ignorant bully
like Bull Connor in Birmingham.


437
00:32:04.510 --> 00:32:07.434
Well, you tell me. 
You know Selma.

438
00:32:07.510 --> 00:32:09.956
You know Sheriff Jim Clark.

439
00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:15.558
Is he Laurie Pritchett?
Or is he Bull Connor?


440
00:32:25.270 --> 00:32:26.271
He's Bull Connor.

441
00:32:27.030 --> 00:32:28.873
- Bingo!
- Good.


442
00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:32.521
That's good.

443
00:32:35.670 --> 00:32:36.751
But it gets better.

444
00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:41.275
<i>See, Clark doesn't control the streets
like Connor did in Birmingham.</i>


445
00:32:41.350 --> 00:32:42.590
<i>Clark's the County Sheriff,</i>

446
00:32:42.670 --> 00:32:45.799
<i>and all he controls in Selma
is the County Courthouse.</i>


447
00:32:45.870 --> 00:32:47.281
<i>So relatively speaking,</i>

448
00:32:47.390 --> 00:32:52.157
<i>we have clear avenues of approach
to a defined battle zone.</i>


449
00:33:46.950 --> 00:33:50.193
<i>In the courthouse
sits the heart of the matter,</i>


450
00:33:50.270 --> 00:33:52.591
<i>the voter registration office.</i>

451
00:33:52.670 --> 00:33:54.513
<i>Now this is
an exceptional circumstance.</i>


452
00:33:54.590 --> 00:33:58.675
<i>See, in Albany, there were
no clearly defined battle zones.</i>


453
00:33:58.750 --> 00:34:03.039
<i>The issue was segregation,
and segregation was everywhere.</i>


454
00:34:03.110 --> 00:34:08.116
<i>In Selma, we can concentrate
our actions on one building.</i>


455
00:34:08.590 --> 00:34:10.957
<i>A citadel, defended by fanatics.</i>

456
00:34:11.950 --> 00:34:13.475
<i>The Selma Courthouse.</i>

457
00:34:14.630 --> 00:34:16.394
<i>A perfect stage.</i>

458
00:34:31.910 --> 00:34:34.311
Y'all deliberately
causing an obstruction!


459
00:34:35.630 --> 00:34:37.871
You don't disperse,
you're gonna be arrested.


460
00:34:37.950 --> 00:34:39.076
I promise you!

461
00:34:39.150 --> 00:34:40.834
Sheriff Clark,

462
00:34:40.910 --> 00:34:43.754
we're trying to gain access
to the registration office.


463
00:34:43.830 --> 00:34:45.400
Which is our legal right.

464
00:34:45.510 --> 00:34:48.081
There's too many of you.
And you know damn well there is!


465
00:34:48.150 --> 00:34:50.312
Now, y'all just gonna have
to wait at the rear!


466
00:34:50.430 --> 00:34:51.955
No, Sheriff Clark.

467
00:34:52.030 --> 00:34:55.512
We're going in the front
and we're gonna wait right here.


468
00:34:55.590 --> 00:34:58.912
Segregation is now illegal
in this country, sir.


469
00:35:01.470 --> 00:35:02.551
Get out, nigger.

470
00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:03.677
- Come on.
- I'm trying.


471
00:35:03.750 --> 00:35:04.831
Kneel down, Daddy.

472
00:35:05.830 --> 00:35:07.116
Come on.

473
00:35:07.470 --> 00:35:09.313
Keep this sidewalk clear. Clear a path!

474
00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:12.150
Get out of the way! 
Get out of the way!

475
00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:13.641
Get the hell out of the way!

476
00:35:13.710 --> 00:35:15.519
Keep the sidewalk clear!

477
00:35:15.870 --> 00:35:17.076
I said keep it clear!

478
00:35:17.150 --> 00:35:18.640
Okay. We about to sit him down.
He can't sit.


479
00:35:18.750 --> 00:35:19.831
Then he needs to learn.

480
00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:21.639
- He gonna sit.
- Sit down, God damn it!


481
00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:23.474
Hey, hey! Pa? Pa?

482
00:35:23.870 --> 00:35:25.281
Daddy.

483
00:35:26.910 --> 00:35:28.594
I just told you he can't sit.

484
00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:30.035
What do we got here?

485
00:35:31.110 --> 00:35:32.111
What's going on here, boy?

486
00:35:32.190 --> 00:35:33.476
What we got here? 
What we got here?

487
00:35:33.550 --> 00:35:35.393
- Jimmie! Sit down!
- No, Mama, I'm sick of this.


488
00:35:35.470 --> 00:35:36.596
- Jimmie!
- Don't do it.


489
00:35:36.670 --> 00:35:37.637
Do you have a problem, boy?

490
00:35:37.710 --> 00:35:39.360
I'm sick of this! 
I just told you...

491
00:35:39.430 --> 00:35:41.831
What'd you think, boy?
What'd you think?


492
00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:43.560
What the fuck are you thinking?

493
00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:55.516
Get that nigger woman!

494
00:35:55.590 --> 00:35:56.796
Kill that nigger bitch!

495
00:35:57.470 --> 00:35:58.676
Get your hands off of me!

496
00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:17.952
<i>We will not tolerate
a bunch of nigra agitators</i>


497
00:36:18.030 --> 00:36:21.716
<i>attempting to orchestrate
a disturbance in this state.</i>


498
00:36:21.790 --> 00:36:23.599
<i>Not as long as I'm governor.</i>

499
00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:30.358
<i>Now, I stand here today</i>

500
00:36:30.430 --> 00:36:32.353
<i>in the cradle of the Confederacy</i>

501
00:36:32.430 --> 00:36:35.036
<i>to remind its people
of our Founding Fathers'</i>


502
00:36:35.110 --> 00:36:37.033
<i>goals of duty.</i>

503
00:36:37.110 --> 00:36:40.353
<i>Goals long since forgotten
by progressives and liberals</i>


504
00:36:40.430 --> 00:36:43.957
<i>in favor of what they call
a changing world.</i>


505
00:36:44.030 --> 00:36:47.876
<i>They seek to make us one mongrel unit.</i>

506
00:36:47.950 --> 00:36:52.035
<i>Instead of allowing each race to flourish
from its separate racial station</i>


507
00:36:52.110 --> 00:36:54.556
<i>as has been the standard
for generations now.</i>


508
00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:55.711
Good morning, Mr. President.

509
00:36:55.790 --> 00:36:57.838
<i>Their changing world</i>

510
00:36:57.910 --> 00:36:59.878
<i>is sickening the balance
of the Southland.</i>


511
00:37:01.910 --> 00:37:03.116
<i>Now...</i>

512
00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:06.677
<i>I pledged to stand up
for Alabama when I campaigned</i>


513
00:37:06.750 --> 00:37:08.718
<i>and the people elected me
on that pledge,</i>


514
00:37:08.790 --> 00:37:11.475
<i>and that is exactly
what I intend to do.</i>

515
00:37:37.150 --> 00:37:39.357
Johnson'll flinch.

516
00:37:39.950 --> 00:37:41.918
I'm tired, Ralphy.

517
00:37:43.910 --> 00:37:45.719
Tiring of this.

518
00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:48.273
Eyes on the prize, Martin.

519
00:37:48.350 --> 00:37:52.196
Yeah, but what is the prize, friend?

520
00:37:52.350 --> 00:37:56.753
We fight to have a seat
at whatever table we want.


521
00:37:56.830 --> 00:37:59.959
How does it help a black man
to be able to eat at a lunch counter


522
00:38:00.030 --> 00:38:02.510
if he doesn't earn enough
to buy the burger?


523
00:38:04.030 --> 00:38:06.032
Or worse yet, can't even...

524
00:38:08.670 --> 00:38:10.035
Can't even read the menu

525
00:38:10.110 --> 00:38:13.557
'cause there was no Negro school
where he's from.


526
00:38:13.630 --> 00:38:15.678
What is that?

527
00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:16.831
That equality?

528
00:38:19.150 --> 00:38:20.197
Amen.

529
00:38:20.270 --> 00:38:22.318
And what about in our minds?

530
00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:26.716
Equality in the black psyche.
Look at these men.


531
00:38:28.030 --> 00:38:31.318
Beaten and broken down
for generations.


532
00:38:31.390 --> 00:38:33.711
Deciding to demand more?

533
00:38:35.670 --> 00:38:38.480
What happens when a man stands up
and says enough is enough?


534
00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:40.359
Look at Medgar.

535
00:38:40.430 --> 00:38:43.479
Murdered the man in his own driveway.

536
00:38:43.550 --> 00:38:45.632
Kids and wife right there
inside the house.


537
00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:48.560
George and Herbert Lee, Lamar Smith.

538
00:38:48.670 --> 00:38:51.753
A man stands up,
only to be struck down.


539
00:38:54.470 --> 00:38:57.076
And what happens to the people he led?

540
00:39:02.070 --> 00:39:04.152
What are we doing, Ralphy?

541
00:39:06.030 --> 00:39:08.431
We take it piece by piece.

542
00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:10.600
Like we been doing.

543
00:39:11.270 --> 00:39:13.591
We build the path as we can.

544
00:39:14.270 --> 00:39:16.193
Rock by rock.

545
00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:25.432
This cell is probably bugged.

546
00:39:28.110 --> 00:39:29.635
It probably is.

547
00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:34.955
Oh, Lord.

548
00:39:40.830 --> 00:39:45.711
They're gonna ruin me
so they can ruin this movement.


549
00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:48.510
They are.

550
00:39:54.710 --> 00:39:56.633
"Look at the birds of the air,

551
00:39:58.990 --> 00:40:02.915
"that they do not sow, nor reap,
nor gather into barns,


552
00:40:04.150 --> 00:40:07.632
"and yet your Heavenly Father
doth feed them.


553
00:40:09.230 --> 00:40:11.551
"Are you not worth
much more than they?


554
00:40:13.190 --> 00:40:16.080
"And who of you by being worried

555
00:40:16.150 --> 00:40:18.676
"can add a single hour to his life?"

556
00:40:19.110 --> 00:40:21.078
Matthew 6, verse 27.

557
00:40:21.150 --> 00:40:22.515
All right.

558
00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:24.796
Yes, sir.

559
00:40:31.630 --> 00:40:32.836
What? Where did you hear that?

560
00:40:32.910 --> 00:40:35.197
I overheard them talking
about him coming in this evening.


561
00:40:35.270 --> 00:40:36.317
Overheard us?

562
00:40:36.390 --> 00:40:38.472
I'm learning about this just like you.
We didn't do this.


563
00:40:38.550 --> 00:40:39.961
That Negro can't be talking about that

564
00:40:40.070 --> 00:40:42.437
"by any means necessary" madness
with these people.


565
00:40:42.510 --> 00:40:43.955
They about to bust as it is.

566
00:40:44.030 --> 00:40:45.111
He's on his way here, right?

567
00:40:45.190 --> 00:40:46.874
So we gotta figure this out.
Right and fast.


568
00:40:46.950 --> 00:40:48.793
He ain't on his way. He here.

569
00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:52.601
Holy shit.

570
00:41:03.510 --> 00:41:04.716
Are you all right?

571
00:41:05.830 --> 00:41:09.391
I wish I had more
time to prepare is all.

572
00:41:10.390 --> 00:41:13.712
I want to do this kind of thing
whenever possible.


573
00:41:13.870 --> 00:41:16.953
But I don't get to do it enough
to feel entirely comfortable.


574
00:41:19.310 --> 00:41:20.721
I prefer to be prepared.

575
00:41:21.230 --> 00:41:24.040
Yes, I understand that.

576
00:41:24.150 --> 00:41:27.154
I admire you. I do.

577
00:41:28.230 --> 00:41:31.439
Sometimes I wish
I were more out there in the trenches.


578
00:41:31.510 --> 00:41:33.751
You do more than you know, Mrs. King.

579
00:41:36.510 --> 00:41:39.161
I'll tell you what
I know to be true.

580
00:41:39.230 --> 00:41:42.040
It helps me in times
when I'm feeling unsure.


581
00:41:42.110 --> 00:41:43.839
If you'd like.

582
00:41:43.910 --> 00:41:46.151
Please do, Mrs. Boynton.

583
00:41:48.150 --> 00:41:51.711
I know that we are descendants
of a mighty people,


584
00:41:51.790 --> 00:41:54.316
who gave civilization to the world.

585
00:41:55.270 --> 00:41:58.353
People who survived
the hulls of slave ships


586
00:41:58.430 --> 00:42:00.319
across vast oceans.

587
00:42:00.390 --> 00:42:04.714
People who innovate
and create and love


588
00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:09.079
despite pressures
and tortures unimaginable.


589
00:42:10.070 --> 00:42:11.993
They are in our bloodstream.

590
00:42:12.070 --> 00:42:14.676
Pumping our hearts every second.

591
00:42:16.110 --> 00:42:17.953
They've prepared you.

592
00:42:19.110 --> 00:42:22.080
You are already prepared.

593
00:42:22.150 --> 00:42:24.630
Mrs. King, I mean no disrespect.

594
00:42:25.950 --> 00:42:28.237
I come with great respect
for your husband.


595
00:42:30.070 --> 00:42:33.392
I have no army behind me anymore.

596
00:42:33.470 --> 00:42:37.031
I have myself and the truth.

597
00:42:37.110 --> 00:42:39.511
That is all I stand on today.

598
00:42:39.590 --> 00:42:42.878
You've said disrespectful things
in the past, Minister.


599
00:42:42.950 --> 00:42:45.601
So you'll understand
why there is some alarm here tonight.


600
00:42:45.670 --> 00:42:48.799
I do. I understand that.

601
00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:52.079
Your husband and I,
we do not see exactly eye-to-eye


602
00:42:52.150 --> 00:42:54.357
on how to achieve progress
for the black man.


603
00:42:54.430 --> 00:42:58.196
And yes, I have been piercing
in my critiques of non-violence.


604
00:42:58.270 --> 00:43:00.272
But because we don't agree, Mrs. King,

605
00:43:00.350 --> 00:43:02.478
does not mean that I'm the enemy.

606
00:43:02.590 --> 00:43:05.753
What do you intend to say
to these people then, sir?


607
00:43:05.830 --> 00:43:07.241
A lot of work has been done here,

608
00:43:07.310 --> 00:43:09.312
and I don't intend to
see it undone tonight.


609
00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:14.912
Let's just say,
my eyes see in a new way.


610
00:43:15.990 --> 00:43:18.994
But your local sheriff here?
He doesn't know that.


611
00:43:19.470 --> 00:43:21.791
So allow me to be the alternative
to your husband.


612
00:43:22.910 --> 00:43:24.753
The alternative that
scares them so much


613
00:43:24.830 --> 00:43:26.673
they turn to Dr. 
King in refuge.

614
00:43:26.750 --> 00:43:29.151
Let my being here, Mrs. King,
represent the factions


615
00:43:29.230 --> 00:43:31.915
that will come if they don't
give the good reverend


616
00:43:31.990 --> 00:43:33.674
what he's asking for and soon.

617
00:43:33.830 --> 00:43:37.118
Do you know what he has said
about us in the past, Coretta?


618
00:43:37.190 --> 00:43:39.796
He called us
"ignorant Negro preachers."


619
00:43:39.870 --> 00:43:41.998
Called me a modern day Uncle Tom.

620
00:43:42.070 --> 00:43:45.119
Said on national television
that the white man pays me


621
00:43:45.190 --> 00:43:48.273
to keep Negroes defenseless.

622
00:43:48.350 --> 00:43:51.274
The white man pays me!

623
00:43:53.270 --> 00:43:55.432
How could you allow it?

624
00:43:55.510 --> 00:43:59.117
It wasn't like that this time, Martin.
I'm telling you...


625
00:43:59.230 --> 00:44:01.631
He spoke with some of the words
he's used before,


626
00:44:01.710 --> 00:44:03.553
but it wasn't aimed at you.

627
00:44:04.150 --> 00:44:05.561
It was...

628
00:44:06.190 --> 00:44:07.555
It had more to do with helping us.

629
00:44:09.990 --> 00:44:12.641
Not that you need his help.
I'm just telling you how it was.


630
00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:15.475
This movement, our movement,

631
00:44:15.550 --> 00:44:17.791
has been the one
that has moved the needle.


632
00:44:17.870 --> 00:44:21.477
Our movement changes laws
and day-to-day life for our people.


633
00:44:21.550 --> 00:44:23.678
But what has he changed?

634
00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:26.071
Actually changed?

635
00:44:28.590 --> 00:44:31.275
You don't sound like yourself.
You sound tired.


636
00:44:31.390 --> 00:44:33.279
And you sound enamored.

637
00:44:40.990 --> 00:44:42.355
I didn't mean that.

638
00:44:43.270 --> 00:44:44.681
Corrie.

639
00:44:47.070 --> 00:44:48.595
Coretta.

640
00:44:49.750 --> 00:44:51.354
I didn't mean that.

641
00:45:06.070 --> 00:45:07.754
I'm tired.

642
00:45:09.110 --> 00:45:10.760
You're right.

643
00:45:18.230 --> 00:45:20.039
Rest then.

644
00:45:21.310 --> 00:45:22.471
Rest tonight, Martin.

645
00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:28.113
<i>This is not what I want to hear.</i>

646
00:45:28.750 --> 00:45:32.072
How in Christ's sake does
Malcolm X slip into my state,


647
00:45:32.150 --> 00:45:34.881
meet with the wife of the other one,

648
00:45:34.990 --> 00:45:36.958
and give an actual speech
to these nigras


649
00:45:37.030 --> 00:45:38.395
who are already riled up enough?

650
00:45:38.470 --> 00:45:39.710
I mean, how does that happen,
Colonel Lingo?


651
00:45:39.830 --> 00:45:41.400
Governor...

652
00:45:41.470 --> 00:45:44.633
Is every spook militant in existence
gonna pay us a visit?


653
00:45:47.790 --> 00:45:49.952
Do you know what this means?

654
00:45:50.030 --> 00:45:52.636
Johnson is going to get jumpy.

655
00:45:53.110 --> 00:45:56.796
King and X together is sending him
through the cotton-pickin' stratosphere.


656
00:45:56.870 --> 00:45:59.601
And pictures of nigras
getting beat in the street


657
00:45:59.670 --> 00:46:00.876
- doesn't help the matter.
- Governor...


658
00:46:00.950 --> 00:46:04.079
Now I can't make a move
against that backwoods,


659
00:46:04.150 --> 00:46:05.595
white trash Sheriff Clark

660
00:46:05.670 --> 00:46:07.274
'cause that'll be seen
as I'm helping King.


661
00:46:07.350 --> 00:46:11.355
But somebody got to
get Jim Clark under control.


662
00:46:12.270 --> 00:46:13.510
Election year is coming up

663
00:46:13.590 --> 00:46:16.833
and this black voting business
won't abide.


664
00:46:17.030 --> 00:46:18.759
I mean, what's not clear about that?

665
00:46:18.870 --> 00:46:21.032
Look, George, I'm telling you,

666
00:46:21.110 --> 00:46:25.798
if the Lord Jesus and Elvis Presley
come visiting and they said,


667
00:46:25.870 --> 00:46:29.955
"Jim, now, we need you to
treat them niggers nice."


668
00:46:30.030 --> 00:46:32.715
Jim Clark would beat the shit
out of the pair of them,


669
00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:33.871
then throw them in jail.

670
00:46:35.190 --> 00:46:36.555
Jesus H. Christ.

671
00:46:36.630 --> 00:46:39.474
Jim's a good old boy,
he's a friend of mine.


672
00:46:39.550 --> 00:46:41.040
Jim Clark just ain't that scary.

673
00:46:42.670 --> 00:46:45.071
Now he's playing into their hands.

674
00:46:45.790 --> 00:46:47.315
Now...

675
00:46:47.390 --> 00:46:49.870
If you want fear,

676
00:46:50.830 --> 00:46:53.481
you need dominance in Selma.

677
00:46:54.710 --> 00:47:00.114
Hoover picked up some intel
about a night march.


678
00:47:00.190 --> 00:47:01.351
Wasn't announced.

679
00:47:01.430 --> 00:47:05.594
It's some locals outside of King's group.
Unofficial, they called it.


680
00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:10.119
Supposed to happen tomorrow night
once King leaves jail.


681
00:47:10.190 --> 00:47:12.841
Going to some bleeding heart fundraiser
in California.


682
00:47:18.150 --> 00:47:19.675
<i>So...</i>

683
00:47:20.590 --> 00:47:22.513
King's out of town.

684
00:47:23.390 --> 00:47:24.630
Fewer cameras.

685
00:47:26.470 --> 00:47:27.551
And at night.

686
00:47:27.910 --> 00:47:30.356
<i>Find a reason to send us in there.</i>

687
00:47:30.430 --> 00:47:33.957
<i>Let's scare some real sense
into them black bastards.</i>


688
00:47:34.070 --> 00:47:35.560
<i>Y'all move back.</i>

689
00:47:35.630 --> 00:47:37.280
<i>Move back now. Get back.</i>

690
00:47:38.110 --> 00:47:39.600
<i>Go back to your homes now.</i>

691
00:47:55.110 --> 00:47:56.271
Stop! Leave him be!

692
00:47:56.350 --> 00:47:57.397
Mama, come on!

693
00:47:58.110 --> 00:47:59.760
Mama, come on!

694
00:48:00.790 --> 00:48:02.599
We gotta keep moving. Come on.

695
00:48:05.870 --> 00:48:07.031
This way, this way.

696
00:48:07.110 --> 00:48:08.271
Leave him alone.

697
00:48:24.910 --> 00:48:26.116
It's all right.

698
00:48:30.150 --> 00:48:32.073
It's gonna be all right. Okay?

699
00:48:32.150 --> 00:48:33.151
Act like you're...

700
00:48:33.230 --> 00:48:34.391
Act like you're reading your menu.
Okay?


701
00:48:35.710 --> 00:48:36.791
It's okay.

702
00:48:37.950 --> 00:48:38.997
Pops...

703
00:48:40.150 --> 00:48:43.233
It's all right, Mama. 
It's gonna be cool.

704
00:48:43.310 --> 00:48:44.880
It's okay, it's okay.

705
00:48:50.630 --> 00:48:51.631
Hey! Hey...

706
00:48:56.430 --> 00:48:59.115
No, get off of him! 
Just get off of him!

707
00:48:59.190 --> 00:49:01.636
Get off of him! No!

708
00:49:02.430 --> 00:49:04.114
No! Get off of him!

709
00:49:07.870 --> 00:49:09.281
Stop it! No, no, no!

710
00:49:11.470 --> 00:49:12.756
Stop it!

711
00:49:39.230 --> 00:49:40.277
Help me.

712
00:49:53.110 --> 00:49:54.350
Help me.

713
00:49:55.510 --> 00:49:56.750
Jimmie.

714
00:49:58.190 --> 00:50:00.955
Jimmie. Jimmie. Jimmie.

715
00:50:01.030 --> 00:50:02.077
Help me.

716
00:50:21.430 --> 00:50:22.795
Sir?

717
00:50:29.430 --> 00:50:30.636
Dr. King.

718
00:50:47.990 --> 00:50:52.040
There are no words to soothe you,
Mr. Lee.


719
00:50:54.190 --> 00:50:56.477
There are no words.

720
00:50:59.470 --> 00:51:02.758
But I can tell
you one thing for certain.

721
00:51:05.670 --> 00:51:07.320
God was the first to cry.

722
00:51:07.390 --> 00:51:08.801
Yes.

723
00:51:09.990 --> 00:51:12.038
He was the first
to cry for your boy.

724
00:51:12.110 --> 00:51:13.874
Yes. I believe that.

725
00:51:17.750 --> 00:51:19.479
Is your daughter...

726
00:51:20.750 --> 00:51:23.674
Is Jimmie Lee's mother here, Mr. Lee?

727
00:51:25.230 --> 00:51:28.712
No, she... She couldn't make it.

728
00:51:35.350 --> 00:51:38.001
May I ask your age, sir?

729
00:51:39.190 --> 00:51:41.591
Well, I... I got 82 years.

730
00:51:42.350 --> 00:51:43.840
1883.

731
00:51:43.910 --> 00:51:45.116
Right.

732
00:51:45.190 --> 00:51:47.272
Yeah. Jimmie...

733
00:51:50.910 --> 00:51:52.912
He born in '38.

734
00:51:54.350 --> 00:51:56.079
He a Army man.

735
00:51:56.150 --> 00:51:58.756
I mean, he was... 
Was an Army man.

736
00:51:58.830 --> 00:52:01.117
In the Army a spell.

737
00:52:02.750 --> 00:52:07.438
He say, "Pa, you gonna vote
before you done."


738
00:52:07.550 --> 00:52:09.393
That's what he said.

739
00:52:11.430 --> 00:52:13.194
He tell me.

740
00:52:15.550 --> 00:52:17.598
- He was a good boy.
- Yes.


741
00:52:17.670 --> 00:52:18.751
Always good.

742
00:52:19.750 --> 00:52:21.514
Always good.

743
00:52:28.870 --> 00:52:30.554
Jimmie gone.

744
00:52:35.750 --> 00:52:37.991
I'm so sorry.

745
00:52:43.670 --> 00:52:44.751
Yeah.

746
00:53:00.710 --> 00:53:06.035
<i>Who murdered Jimmie Lee Jackson?</i>

747
00:53:10.310 --> 00:53:14.110
<i>Who murdered Jimmie Lee Jackson?</i>

748
00:53:16.510 --> 00:53:18.990
<i>We know a state trooper</i>

749
00:53:19.070 --> 00:53:21.277
<i>acting under the orders
of George Wallace</i>


750
00:53:21.350 --> 00:53:23.751
<i>pointed the gun and pulled the trigger.</i>

751
00:53:25.270 --> 00:53:29.116
<i>But how many other fingers
were on that trigger?</i>


752
00:53:32.350 --> 00:53:34.591
<i>Who murdered Jimmie Lee Jackson?</i>

753
00:53:36.950 --> 00:53:41.638
<i>Every white lawman
who abuses the law to terrorize.</i>


754
00:53:44.750 --> 00:53:47.640
<i>Every white politician</i>

755
00:53:47.710 --> 00:53:50.793
<i>who feeds on prejudice and hatred.</i>

756
00:53:53.070 --> 00:53:56.711
<i>Every white preacher
who preaches the Bible</i>


757
00:53:56.790 --> 00:53:59.600
<i>and stays silent
before his white congregation.</i>


758
00:54:03.830 --> 00:54:06.674
<i>Who murdered Jimmie Lee Jackson?</i>

759
00:54:07.870 --> 00:54:13.752
<i>Every Negro man and woman
who stands by without joining this fight</i>


760
00:54:13.830 --> 00:54:16.754
<i>as their brothers and sisters
are humiliated,</i>


761
00:54:16.830 --> 00:54:19.720
<i>brutalized, and ripped from this earth!</i>

762
00:54:27.030 --> 00:54:28.919
<i>When I heard</i>

763
00:54:28.990 --> 00:54:32.358
<i>President Kennedy
had been shot and killed...</i>


764
00:54:33.830 --> 00:54:36.401
<i>And when I heard just yesterday</i>

765
00:54:36.470 --> 00:54:38.279
<i>that Malcolm X,</i>

766
00:54:38.350 --> 00:54:41.593
<i>who stood in this very church
just three weeks ago,</i>


767
00:54:41.670 --> 00:54:43.672
<i>had been shot and killed,</i>

768
00:54:45.470 --> 00:54:47.791
<i>I turned to my wife Coretta</i>

769
00:54:47.870 --> 00:54:52.512
<i>and said the same thing I often say
when one of our leaders is struck down,</i>


770
00:54:54.430 --> 00:54:57.479
<i>"Our lives are not fully lived</i>

771

<i>"if we're not willing to die

<i>"and for what we believe."</i>

773
00:55:06.870 --> 00:55:09.316
<i>But today, Jimmie,</i>

774
00:55:09.390 --> 00:55:13.076
<i>we're doing the living
and you've done the dying, dear brother.</i>


775
00:55:14.150 --> 00:55:18.314
<i>We will not let your sacrifice
pass in vain, dear brother.</i>


776
00:55:18.390 --> 00:55:20.358
<i>We will not let it go!</i>

777
00:55:20.430 --> 00:55:22.637
<i>We will finish what you were after!</i>

778
00:55:22.710 --> 00:55:25.156
<i>We will get what you were denied!</i>

779
00:55:25.230 --> 00:55:28.757
<i>We will vote and we will
put these men out of office!</i>


780
00:55:28.830 --> 00:55:30.832
<i>We will take their power!</i>

781
00:55:30.910 --> 00:55:33.231
<i>We will win
what you were slaughtered for!</i>


782
00:55:33.430 --> 00:55:35.398
Yeah!

783
00:55:38.150 --> 00:55:40.437
<i>We're going back to Washington.</i>

784
00:55:41.070 --> 00:55:43.118
<i>We're going to demand
to see the President.</i>


785
00:55:43.190 --> 00:55:45.318
<i>And I'm gonna tell him</i>

786
00:55:45.470 --> 00:55:48.679
<i>that Jimmie was murdered
by an administration</i>


787

<i>that spends millions of dollars every day</i>

788
00:55:51.750 --> 00:55:55.118
<i>to sacrifice life
in the name of liberty in Vietnam,</i>


789
00:55:55.190 --> 00:55:58.160
<i>yet lacks the moral will
and the moral courage</i>


790
00:55:58.230 --> 00:56:02.952
<i>to defend the lives
of its own people here in America!</i>


791
00:56:04.590 --> 00:56:06.433
<i>We will not let it go!</i>

792
00:56:07.590 --> 00:56:11.436
<i>And if he does not act, we will act.
We will act!</i>


793
00:56:11.550 --> 00:56:13.837
<i>We will do it for
all of our lost ones.</i>

794
00:56:13.950 --> 00:56:16.271
<i>All of those, like Jimmie Lee Jackson,</i>

795
00:56:16.350 --> 00:56:20.116
<i>who have gone too soon, taken by hate!</i>

796
00:56:28.190 --> 00:56:29.874
Let me hear the top-tier issues

797
00:56:29.950 --> 00:56:33.875
that have to be evident
in the overall legislation we demand.


798
00:56:33.950 --> 00:56:35.111
Let's break it down.

799
00:56:35.190 --> 00:56:37.636
But let's root this discussion
in what we know.


800
00:56:38.430 --> 00:56:41.001
We know Johnson
can't see the full picture.


801
00:56:41.070 --> 00:56:42.799
So, let's paint it for him.

802
00:56:42.910 --> 00:56:46.995
What are the specific hardships
and humiliations


803
00:56:47.070 --> 00:56:50.995
we can address
within the larger context of legislation?


804
00:56:52.470 --> 00:56:55.553
Doc, we gotta start
with banning these laws that


805
00:56:55.670 --> 00:56:58.196
if a Negro tries to register,

806
00:56:58.270 --> 00:57:01.001
I mean, actually musters up the courage
to go in that courthouse,


807
00:57:01.670 --> 00:57:04.799
that their name and address
is published in the paper.


808
00:57:04.870 --> 00:57:07.237
It gives anybody who wants
to do them any harm


809
00:57:07.350 --> 00:57:10.001
their exact location,
and we know how the Klan is.


810
00:57:10.070 --> 00:57:12.835
I hear that. But the poll taxes
got to be our focus first.


811
00:57:12.910 --> 00:57:15.277
'Cause black people are poor!
Black people are poor down here.


812
00:57:15.670 --> 00:57:17.274
- Yep.
- And they expected to pay for every year


813
00:57:17.350 --> 00:57:19.432
they weren't legally registered
before they can register.


814
00:57:19.510 --> 00:57:22.195
Now, what the hell is that?
Who got that kind of money?


815
00:57:23.870 --> 00:57:25.599
Come on now! Listen now!

816
00:57:25.670 --> 00:57:28.276
The big issue is voting vouchers.

817
00:57:28.350 --> 00:57:29.431
Is that the number one issue?

818
00:57:29.510 --> 00:57:30.591
Now hold on. Let me finish.

819
00:57:30.670 --> 00:57:32.240
'Cause everybody'll forget
about this part.


820
00:57:32.310 --> 00:57:35.120
But if you're Negro,
the only way you can vote


821
00:57:35.190 --> 00:57:37.796
is if an approved registered
voter vouches for you.


822
00:57:37.870 --> 00:57:40.999
Right? So, let's say, you take
some place like Lowndes County,


823
00:57:41.230 --> 00:57:43.232
where there are no Negroes
who are registered


824
00:57:43.310 --> 00:57:45.278
and you've got to have
someone who is registered


825
00:57:45.350 --> 00:57:47.114
to vouch for you.

826
00:57:47.190 --> 00:57:48.396
What are you supposed to do?

827
00:57:49.870 --> 00:57:51.474
Nobody you know,

828
00:57:51.550 --> 00:57:55.794
not a single black person
for 100 miles is registered.


829
00:57:55.870 --> 00:57:59.397
So how do you get the voucher, right?

830
00:57:59.470 --> 00:58:01.837
To get you into the courthouse door

831
00:58:01.910 --> 00:58:04.311
to pay the poll tax

832
00:58:04.390 --> 00:58:06.711
to get your name published

833
00:58:07.110 --> 00:58:08.350
and get yourself dead.

834
00:58:09.910 --> 00:58:10.911
That's true.

835
00:58:10.990 --> 00:58:12.515
We need a new plan!

836
00:58:12.590 --> 00:58:14.194
I can't take him back to Washington

837
00:58:14.270 --> 00:58:17.035
and waltz into the White House
with a list of empty demands.


838
00:58:17.150 --> 00:58:19.039
Tactics, my friends!

839
00:58:19.110 --> 00:58:21.761
We must break down this institution

840
00:58:21.830 --> 00:58:24.720
into the tangible tactics
that it takes to dismantle it.


841
00:58:27.110 --> 00:58:28.157
<i>What's your next move?</i>

842
00:58:28.230 --> 00:58:32.440
A march from Selma to Montgomery
to protest and amplify.


843
00:58:32.590 --> 00:58:34.558
Well, I'll be damned.

844
00:58:34.630 --> 00:58:37.031
This was always part of the plan,
wasn't it?


845
00:58:37.110 --> 00:58:40.034
Provoke some tragedy
in little old Selma, then go big.


846
00:58:40.590 --> 00:58:44.037
Get someone killed
and march on the State Capitol!


847
00:58:44.430 --> 00:58:47.115
Selma to Montgomery's
gotta be 50 miles!


848
00:58:47.190 --> 00:58:49.921
You march those people
into rural Alabama unprotected,


849
00:58:49.990 --> 00:58:51.151
it's gonna be open season.

850
00:58:51.230 --> 00:58:53.676
It's too damn far
and too damn dangerous!


851
00:58:53.790 --> 00:58:55.633
Then propose new legislation, sir.

852
00:58:55.750 --> 00:58:58.321
I can't do that this year. I won't!
I told you.


853
00:58:58.870 --> 00:59:00.872
We need your involvement here,
Mr. President.


854
00:59:00.950 --> 00:59:03.601
We deserve your help
as citizens of this country.


855
00:59:03.670 --> 00:59:05.035
Citizens under attack.

856
00:59:05.110 --> 00:59:07.954
Now, you listen to me. 
You listen to me.

857
00:59:08.030 --> 00:59:09.919
You're an activist. 
I'm a politician.

858
00:59:09.990 --> 00:59:12.596
You got one big issue.
I got a hundred and one.


859
00:59:12.670 --> 00:59:14.638
Now, you demanding more

860
00:59:14.710 --> 00:59:17.031
and putting me on the spot
with this visit, that's okay.


861
00:59:17.110 --> 00:59:18.874
That's your job. 
That's what you do.

862
00:59:18.950 --> 00:59:21.556
But I am sick and tired

863
00:59:21.630 --> 00:59:26.318
of you demanding and telling me
what I can and what I can't do.


864
00:59:26.390 --> 00:59:28.119
If you want my support
on this voting thing,


865
00:59:28.190 --> 00:59:30.192
I need some quid pro quo from you.

866
00:59:30.670 --> 00:59:32.081
What do you want, Mr. President?

867
00:59:32.150 --> 00:59:35.472
We have a line
on some threats that are

868
00:59:36.990 --> 00:59:38.435
particularly troubling.

869
00:59:38.510 --> 00:59:40.239
Well, what's new?

870
00:59:40.310 --> 00:59:44.918
No, no. This is serious.
Credible threats with detail.


871
00:59:44.990 --> 00:59:47.675
This information,
coming from the FBI, I assume?


872
00:59:48.790 --> 00:59:49.916
High-level?

873
00:59:50.510 --> 00:59:53.912
The same high-level
that's been tracking us like animals?


874
00:59:53.990 --> 00:59:57.676
Bugging our homes
and our hotel rooms.


875
00:59:58.150 --> 01:00:01.757
Digging for things that
simply are not there, Lee?


876
01:00:02.870 --> 01:00:05.350
This all feels very convenient.

877
01:00:06.510 --> 01:00:07.796
Okay.

878
01:00:08.070 --> 01:00:10.755
This is coming
from Lowndes County, Alabama.


879
01:00:10.830 --> 01:00:12.958
Between Selma and Montgomery.

880
01:00:14.750 --> 01:00:17.959
I'm telling you, if he were my guy,

881
01:00:18.030 --> 01:00:20.431
I'd keep him off the frontlines.

882
01:00:21.270 --> 01:00:22.476
Just for a while.

883
01:00:25.510 --> 01:00:26.921
Not gonna happen, Lee.

884
01:00:26.990 --> 01:00:29.197
Meet me halfway on this, Martin.

885
01:00:29.270 --> 01:00:31.318
I can't, Mr. President.

886
01:00:31.430 --> 01:00:33.114
Can't or won't?

887
01:00:33.190 --> 01:00:37.639
I came here hoping
to talk to you about people.


888
01:00:38.350 --> 01:00:40.796
People are dying in the street for this.

889
01:00:40.990 --> 01:00:43.470
It cannot wait, sir.

890
01:00:44.470 --> 01:00:46.472
Mr. President, how did it go?

891
01:00:51.870 --> 01:00:53.520
What can I do to help?

892
01:00:56.230 --> 01:00:58.517
Get me J. Edgar Hoover.

893
01:00:59.790 --> 01:01:01.076
<i>King,</i>

894
01:01:01.950 --> 01:01:04.032
<i>you know you are a complete fraud</i>

895
01:01:04.110 --> 01:01:07.159
<i>and a liability to all nigras.</i>

896
01:01:07.230 --> 01:01:10.359
<i>Like all frauds, your end is approaching.</i>

897
01:01:11.230 --> 01:01:12.834
<i>You are done.</i>

898
01:01:13.590 --> 01:01:18.471
<i>Your degrees and your fancy awards
will not save you.</i>


899
01:01:18.910 --> 01:01:23.837
<i>The American public will
soon know you for what you are,</i>


900
01:01:23.910 --> 01:01:27.278
<i>an evil, abnormal beast.</i>

901
01:01:45.430 --> 01:01:46.955
That wasn't me.

902
01:01:49.990 --> 01:01:51.719
That isn't me, Corrie.

903
01:01:56.190 --> 01:01:57.476
I know.

904
01:01:59.990 --> 01:02:02.641
I know what you sound like.

905
01:02:12.590 --> 01:02:14.638
I've gotten used to a lot.

906
01:02:17.710 --> 01:02:21.556
All the hours
wondering after your safety,


907
01:02:22.990 --> 01:02:25.357
worried about how you are.

908
01:02:30.390 --> 01:02:31.471
This house.

909
01:02:33.670 --> 01:02:34.910
Renting here.

910
01:02:37.150 --> 01:02:38.754
No foundation.

911
01:02:44.070 --> 01:02:46.801
Without the things
the children should have,


912
01:02:46.870 --> 01:02:48.998
all because of how it would look.

913
01:02:54.190 --> 01:02:56.557
I have gotten used to it,

914
01:02:57.470 --> 01:03:00.041
for better or worse.

915
01:03:04.510 --> 01:03:07.798
But what I have never gotten used to

916
01:03:08.110 --> 01:03:10.158
is the death.

917
01:03:12.230 --> 01:03:16.918
The constant closeness of death.

918
01:03:21.390 --> 01:03:24.519
It's become like a thick fog to me.

919
01:03:26.310 --> 01:03:29.473
I can't see life sometimes

920
01:03:29.550 --> 01:03:33.760
because of the fog of death
constantly hanging over.


921
01:03:37.390 --> 01:03:41.031
People actually say that
they will stop the blood


922
01:03:41.110 --> 01:03:44.512
running through the hearts
of our children.


923
01:03:44.590 --> 01:03:47.912
That's what they said on the other end
of that phone line.


924
01:03:51.230 --> 01:03:53.836
How they're going to kill my children.

925
01:03:54.630 --> 01:03:56.997
And what they'll do to you
and how they'll do it.


926
01:03:57.070 --> 01:03:59.516
How many years
have I had to listen to this?


927
01:03:59.590 --> 01:04:00.716
The filth,

928
01:04:00.790 --> 01:04:06.433
deranged and twisted
and just ignorant enough to be serious.


929
01:04:13.590 --> 01:04:15.399
If I ask you something,

930
01:04:17.110 --> 01:04:20.432
will you answer me with the truth?

931
01:04:22.470 --> 01:04:23.551
Yes.

932
01:04:25.190 --> 01:04:29.479
Good, because I am not a fool.

933
01:04:38.310 --> 01:04:40.153
Do you love me?

934
01:04:47.230 --> 01:04:49.597
Yes, I love you, Coretta.

935
01:05:01.070 --> 01:05:03.277
Do you love any of the others?

936
01:05:24.990 --> 01:05:26.879
No.

937
01:05:44.470 --> 01:05:46.996
I need to put
the march back a day.

938
01:05:47.470 --> 01:05:48.471
<i>Why?</i>

939
01:05:49.870 --> 01:05:52.077
<i>I have to be home right now.</i>

940
01:05:55.710 --> 01:05:58.793
<i>Yes. Okay. I understand.</i>

941
01:06:01.350 --> 01:06:05.639
<i>But I have to tell you
the organization looks good.</i>


942
01:06:05.710 --> 01:06:07.235
<i>Real good.</i>

943
01:06:07.310 --> 01:06:10.632
<i>The mood is strong.
And the locals are prepared.</i>


944
01:06:10.710 --> 01:06:12.439
<i>The SNCC kids are ready to go.</i>

945
01:06:12.550 --> 01:06:18.557
<i>We can start it off from Selma,
and you can join in on the second day.</i>


946
01:06:30.950 --> 01:06:33.351
<i>I just think it'd be a mistake
to hold people back</i>


947
01:06:33.430 --> 01:06:34.955
<i>when their blood is up.</i>

948
01:06:36.390 --> 01:06:40.031
<i>I hear you,
but we need to be out there full throttle.</i>


949
01:06:40.110 --> 01:06:42.681
<i>This ain't a test run.</i>

950
01:06:42.750 --> 01:06:44.195
<i>We need to get to Montgomery.</i>

951
01:06:44.270 --> 01:06:46.841
<i>I warned Johnson that
we were going to the Capitol.</i>


952
01:06:46.910 --> 01:06:48.753
<i>We need to do just that.</i>

953
01:06:49.750 --> 01:06:53.072
<i>And I believe we will. 
We'll get there.</i>

954
01:06:56.910 --> 01:06:59.231
<i>And when we do the real deal,
the finale,</i>


955
01:06:59.310 --> 01:07:01.392
<i>when you make the big speech
at the end,</i>


956
01:07:01.470 --> 01:07:03.711
<i>right on Wallace's doorstep.</i>

957
01:07:18.470 --> 01:07:20.916
<i>I don't know, Andy.</i>

958
01:07:22.230 --> 01:07:24.073
<i>It'll be just fine.</i>

959
01:07:24.630 --> 01:07:28.316
<i>We'll get it started strong.
And you'll finish strong.</i>


960
01:07:34.790 --> 01:07:36.952
Okay. Let's proceed.

961
01:07:37.670 --> 01:07:39.593
<i>But only one of us walks to start.</i>

962
01:07:39.670 --> 01:07:43.641
<i>I don't want to get back on Monday
and find all our leadership in jail.</i>


963
01:07:44.510 --> 01:07:45.750
<i>One of us walks.</i>

964
01:07:46.350 --> 01:07:47.840
<i>Understood.</i>

965
01:07:50.670 --> 01:07:54.834
<i>There will be no march
from Selma to Montgomery.</i>


966
01:07:55.150 --> 01:07:58.757
<i>It is not conducive to traffic flow
on Route 80.</i>


967
01:07:58.830 --> 01:08:00.275
<i>Or to public safety.</i>

968
01:08:00.350 --> 01:08:01.954
Your lives could be in danger,

969
01:08:02.030 --> 01:08:04.237
but we're going to be strong
if we stick together.


970
01:08:04.310 --> 01:08:07.553
Don't fight back.
It's a non-violent movement.


971
01:08:07.990 --> 01:08:11.039
Non-violence is not passive.
It's actually very strong.


972
01:08:11.670 --> 01:08:14.913
We shouldn't do this, John.
This is not us. This is not SNCC.


973
01:08:14.990 --> 01:08:16.230
It's some bullshit.

974
01:08:16.350 --> 01:08:19.559
It's gonna do more for King
and the SCLC than for Selma.


975
01:08:19.950 --> 01:08:21.076
This is Alabama.

976
01:08:21.190 --> 01:08:23.591
They can keep their asses
in Washington, D.C.


977
01:08:23.670 --> 01:08:25.911
You don't tell us
how to live our lives.

978
01:08:25.990 --> 01:08:28.311
This is an example of what
you might deal with out there.


979
01:08:28.390 --> 01:08:31.473
What you might experience.
Here we go. Let's show them.


980
01:08:31.550 --> 01:08:33.473
We don't want your kind here.

981
01:08:33.550 --> 01:08:35.154
Go to the bottom
of the river, black boy.

982
01:08:35.230 --> 01:08:36.834
<i>We're going to put you down
in Alabama River!</i>


983
01:08:36.910 --> 01:08:39.072
<i>He's not even here.
How's it gonna do more for him?</i>


984
01:08:39.150 --> 01:08:40.959
<i>Well, why ain't he here, then, man?</i>

985
01:08:41.030 --> 01:08:42.998
Are you listening to yourself?

986
01:08:43.070 --> 01:08:45.391
First, it's gonna do more for him.
Now, it's why he ain't here?


987
01:08:45.470 --> 01:08:46.915
Do you want him here,
or do you not want him here?


988
01:08:46.990 --> 01:08:49.675
Honestly, I don't give a rat's ass
about that man. That's your hero.


989
01:08:49.750 --> 01:08:52.674
Let's take these bastards
and stick them down into Alabama River


990
01:08:52.750 --> 01:08:53.956
and never see them again.

991
01:08:54.030 --> 01:08:55.475
James, you are so off-base with this.

992
01:08:55.550 --> 01:08:57.314
All this nonsense.
This ain't what SNCC is about.


993
01:08:57.390 --> 01:08:58.516
Don't make me out to be
the bad guy here, John.


994
01:08:58.590 --> 01:09:00.319
I'm not!
You're the one playing me small.


995
01:09:00.390 --> 01:09:02.040
Don't demonize me...

996
01:09:02.430 --> 01:09:04.558
You're mad because they called him in.

997
01:09:05.870 --> 01:09:07.952
We were here first.
And they called him in.


998
01:09:08.070 --> 01:09:10.641
I get it. I understand that.

999
01:09:10.710 --> 01:09:14.032
But if we are really
and truly for the people,


1000
01:09:14.110 --> 01:09:16.431
and the people of Selma chose him,

1001
01:09:17.910 --> 01:09:19.878
well, then the people have spoken.

1002
01:09:21.870 --> 01:09:25.079
And if they want to march,
then I'm marching with them.


1003
01:09:28.230 --> 01:09:29.755
Then, brother,

1004
01:09:30.950 --> 01:09:33.271
you're marching as John Lewis.

1005
01:09:34.070 --> 01:09:35.834
Not as part of SNCC.

1006
01:09:37.750 --> 01:09:39.752
It's been voted on and decided.

1007
01:09:40.710 --> 01:09:44.715
For this march, you're on your own
with De Lawd and his disciples.


1008
01:10:15.790 --> 01:10:17.679
Short man wins. 
Short man wins.

1009
01:10:18.310 --> 01:10:19.800
Short man wins.

1010
01:10:21.430 --> 01:10:22.636
All right.

1011
01:10:24.670 --> 01:10:26.798
All right. Who got it?

1012
01:10:28.510 --> 01:10:30.035
It's on you, Hosea.

1013
01:10:30.150 --> 01:10:32.721
You ready, young blood? You ready?

1014
01:10:32.790 --> 01:10:35.236
- All right. Let's do this.
- All right.


1015
01:10:39.870 --> 01:10:42.601
<i>About 525 Negroes
had left Brown's Chapel</i>


1016
01:10:42.670 --> 01:10:44.354
<i>and walked six blocks to cross
Pettus Bridge</i>


1017
01:10:44.430 --> 01:10:46.194
<i>and the Alabama River.</i>

1018
01:11:02.070 --> 01:11:03.879
There were young and old,

1019
01:11:03.950 --> 01:11:05.759
and they carried
an assortment of packs,


1020
01:11:05.830 --> 01:11:07.912
bed rolls and lunch sacks.

1021
01:12:21.190 --> 01:12:25.240
<i>The troopers were waiting

1022
01:12:26.190 --> 01:12:29.239
<i>Behind the troopers
were dozens of possemen,</i>


1023
01:12:29.750 --> 01:12:34.711
<i>15 of them on horses,
and perhaps 100 white spectators.</i>


1024
01:12:45.110 --> 01:12:46.839
Can you swim?

1025
01:12:47.830 --> 01:12:51.391
Not many swimming pools for black folk
where I come from.


1026
01:12:52.430 --> 01:12:54.080
Yeah.

1027
01:13:21.710 --> 01:13:23.838
<i>Andy, it's Bayard. 
Everybody there?</i>

1028
01:13:24.110 --> 01:13:25.111
Yes.

1029
01:13:25.190 --> 01:13:26.396
<i>Turn on CBS right now, Andy.</i>

1030
01:13:26.470 --> 01:13:27.710
Right now. You have a TV there?

1031
01:13:27.990 --> 01:13:29.879
- Yes. Now?
- Right now!


1032
01:13:30.190 --> 01:13:31.954
Turn on the television set.

1033
01:13:32.870 --> 01:13:37.034
<i>We interrupt this program to bring you
a special bulletin from CBS News.</i>


1034
01:13:52.910 --> 01:13:55.231
Give 'em two minutes. 
Stand right there.

1035
01:13:55.310 --> 01:13:56.675
We're ready.

1036
01:14:09.990 --> 01:14:11.992
<i>This is an unlawful assembly.</i>

1037
01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:14.391
<i>You have two minutes to disperse.</i>

1038
01:14:14.470 --> 01:14:17.201
<i>Go home or go to your church.</i>

1039
01:14:17.390 --> 01:14:20.473
<i>This march will not continue.</i>

1040
01:14:21.030 --> 01:14:22.839
Two minutes.

1041
01:14:26.150 --> 01:14:28.835
May I have a word with the Major?

1042
01:14:31.230 --> 01:14:33.073
<i>There's no word to be had.</i>

1043
01:14:35.470 --> 01:14:37.393
Major Cloud, may we speak with you?

1044
01:14:50.510 --> 01:14:52.114
<i>Troopers, advance!</i>

1045
01:15:07.790 --> 01:15:10.441
Seventy million people
are watching this.


1046
01:15:10.510 --> 01:15:12.433
<i>The first 10 or 20 Negroes</i>

1047
01:15:12.510 --> 01:15:15.275
<i>were swept to the ground screaming,
arms and legs flying,</i>


1048
01:15:15.350 --> 01:15:18.513
<i>packs and bags went skittering
across the grassy divider.</i>


1049
01:15:33.390 --> 01:15:35.836
<i>Those still on their feet retreated.</i>

1050
01:15:35.910 --> 01:15:37.958
<i>A cheer went up
from the white spectators</i>


1051
01:15:38.030 --> 01:15:39.680
<i>lining the south side of the highway.</i>

1052
01:15:46.150 --> 01:15:49.040
Come on. You gotta come on.

1053
01:15:49.110 --> 01:15:50.236
Please, don't...

1054
01:15:51.830 --> 01:15:54.993
<i>The troopers continued pushing,
using both the force of their bodies</i>


1055
01:15:55.070 --> 01:15:56.515
<i>and the prodding of their nightsticks.</i>

1056
01:16:11.110 --> 01:16:14.831
<i>Suddenly, there was a sharp sound,
like a gunshot,</i>


1057
01:16:14.910 --> 01:16:19.040
<i>and a gray cloud spewed over
the troopers and the Negroes.</i>


1058
01:16:19.110 --> 01:16:21.590
<i>But before the cloud hid it all,</i>

1059
01:16:21.710 --> 01:16:25.874
there were several seconds
of unobstructed view.


1060
01:16:46.230 --> 01:16:50.315
<i>Fifteen or 20 nightsticks
could be seen through the gas,</i>


1061
01:16:50.390 --> 01:16:53.041
<i>flailing at the heads of the marchers.</i>

1062
01:16:54.590 --> 01:16:57.799
<i>The Negroes cried out
as they crowded together for protection,</i>


1063
01:16:57.870 --> 01:17:00.032
<i>and the whites on the sidelines
whooped and cheered.</i>


1064
01:17:12.830 --> 01:17:15.515
<i>From the hospital
came reports of victims</i>


1065
01:17:15.590 --> 01:17:19.834
<i>suffering fractures of ribs,
heads, arms and legs.</i>


1066
01:17:19.910 --> 01:17:21.912
<i>And Negro leader John Lewis,</i>

1067
01:17:21.990 --> 01:17:24.311
<i>despite injury from
a possible skull fracture,</i>


1068
01:17:24.390 --> 01:17:26.199
<i>led the marchers back to the chapel</i>

1069
01:17:26.270 --> 01:17:28.352
<i>after the encounter with officers.</i>

1070
01:17:29.270 --> 01:17:30.715
Help!

1071
01:17:31.230 --> 01:17:32.231
Help!

1072
01:17:36.990 --> 01:17:40.881
<i>He said,
"I don't see how President Johnson</i>


1073
01:17:40.950 --> 01:17:42.361
<i>"can send troops to Vietnam</i>

1074
01:17:42.630 --> 01:17:46.396
"and can't send troops
to Selma, Alabama."


1075
01:17:46.470 --> 01:17:50.600
To which the Negroes present
roared their approval.


1076
01:18:32.750 --> 01:18:35.196
Gerry! Gerry, come with us!
Come with us!


1077
01:18:35.270 --> 01:18:36.556
We need your gun, man!

1078
01:18:36.630 --> 01:18:37.995
I can't walk!

1079
01:18:38.070 --> 01:18:40.676
Come with us. We know you got
them guns in the shed, Gerry.


1080
01:18:40.750 --> 01:18:43.117
Hey, hey, hey, what you need guns for?

1081
01:18:43.190 --> 01:18:44.874
The Bible says,
"An eye for an eye," Reverend.


1082
01:18:44.950 --> 01:18:46.520
- Yeah?
- I'm sick of this shit!


1083
01:18:46.590 --> 01:18:48.672
How many guns
you think they got down there?


1084
01:18:48.750 --> 01:18:50.639
That's an entire army down there.

1085
01:18:50.710 --> 01:18:53.031
What you got? A
couple of .32s? A .38?

1086
01:18:53.110 --> 01:18:54.441
Maybe a couple of old scatterguns?
What?


1087
01:18:54.510 --> 01:18:57.036
I got enough to kill a couple
of them crackers, that's what I got!


1088
01:18:57.110 --> 01:19:00.398
And how many of us you think
they gonna kill in retaliation?


1089
01:19:00.470 --> 01:19:03.599
With their 12-gauge pump-actions,
their Colt automatics,


1090
01:19:03.670 --> 01:19:06.150
their Remingtons,
their helicopters, their tanks!


1091
01:19:06.870 --> 01:19:10.272
We won't win that way,
and I ain't talking about the Bible.


1092
01:19:10.470 --> 01:19:14.794
I ain't talking what's right by God.
I am talking facts. Cold, hard facts!


1093
01:19:14.870 --> 01:19:19.239
Now, you take two of them,
and they take 10 of us.


1094
01:19:19.310 --> 01:19:22.917
No. We have to win another way.

1095
01:19:24.310 --> 01:19:26.472
<i>...to our regularly scheduled program.</i>

1096
01:19:34.150 --> 01:19:36.198
We're going back to the bridge.

1097
01:19:39.670 --> 01:19:43.197
We're going to finish this,
we promise you that, Ms. Amelia.


1098
01:19:46.430 --> 01:19:48.273
We go again.

1099
01:19:53.390 --> 01:19:56.121
Dr. King! Can we get a statement, sir?

1100
01:19:56.190 --> 01:19:59.000
Dr. King! Morning, Doctor.
Can we get a statement, please?


1101
01:19:59.070 --> 01:20:00.481
- Morning.
- Morning.


1102
01:20:01.950 --> 01:20:07.320
While rageful violence continues
towards the unarmed people of Selma,


1103
01:20:07.670 --> 01:20:13.439
while they are assaulted with tear gas
and batons like an enemy in a war,


1104
01:20:13.510 --> 01:20:17.071
no citizen of this country
can call themselves blameless,


1105
01:20:17.150 --> 01:20:20.836
for we all bear a responsibility
for our fellow man.


1106
01:20:21.470 --> 01:20:24.474
I am appealing to
men and women of God


1107
01:20:24.550 --> 01:20:26.552
and goodwill everywhere,

1108
01:20:26.630 --> 01:20:28.951
white, black and otherwise.

1109
01:20:29.030 --> 01:20:34.799
If you believe all are created equal,
come to Selma.


1110
01:20:34.870 --> 01:20:39.319
Join us. Join our march
against injustice and inhumanity.


1111
01:20:40.230 --> 01:20:41.880
We need you to stand with us.

1112
01:20:44.590 --> 01:20:47.514
<i>Judge Johnson, Dr. 
King's call-to-action</i>

1113
01:20:47.590 --> 01:20:49.319
<i>was nationally televised.</i>

1114
01:20:50.710 --> 01:20:52.838
<i>We've seen hundreds of people
travel across the country</i>


1115
01:20:52.910 --> 01:20:54.674
<i>to attend tomorrow's march,</i>

1116
01:20:54.750 --> 01:20:58.835
<i>mostly white,
mostly clergy of some kind.</i>


1117
01:21:00.350 --> 01:21:03.559
The SCLC is seeking
a federal court order


1118
01:21:03.630 --> 01:21:07.112
enjoining the state authorities
from interfering with the next march.


1119
01:21:08.190 --> 01:21:10.557
You're asking me to overturn
the Governor's mandate


1120
01:21:10.630 --> 01:21:12.678
and to do so without a hearing,

1121
01:21:12.750 --> 01:21:16.072
but it's not going to happen at all
without a proper proceeding.


1122
01:21:16.150 --> 01:21:19.120
Dr. King is in position to
lead tomorrow's march, Judge.


1123
01:21:19.190 --> 01:21:23.195
Understood, but you will have
your day in court on Thursday, Mr. Gray.


1124
01:21:23.270 --> 01:21:26.080
Meanwhile, there will be
no march tomorrow.


1125
01:21:26.150 --> 01:21:28.676
I will not oppose Wallace
against protocol.


1126
01:21:29.990 --> 01:21:32.914
"Thousands head south
in moral crusade."


1127
01:21:36.630 --> 01:21:40.999
The SCLC already filed an appeal
against Wallace's orders this morning.


1128
01:21:43.590 --> 01:21:45.558
You want my advice, Mr. President?

1129
01:21:45.950 --> 01:21:47.475
You have to ask?

1130
01:21:47.710 --> 01:21:50.554
Give King the march to Montgomery.

1131
01:21:52.430 --> 01:21:55.593
Do that, and then Selma's over.

1132
01:21:57.030 --> 01:21:58.191
Then you're back in control.

1133
01:21:58.350 --> 01:22:00.352
In control of what?

1134
01:22:00.430 --> 01:22:02.319
Another civil war?

1135
01:22:02.390 --> 01:22:05.837
This ain't about the goddamn march.
You think he cares about the march?


1136
01:22:05.910 --> 01:22:08.516
He wants the law changed, now.

1137
01:22:08.870 --> 01:22:10.599
I've got Congress
calling me by the dozens.


1138
01:22:10.670 --> 01:22:13.150
I've got picketing that gets
bigger and bigger every day.


1139
01:22:13.270 --> 01:22:15.841
He tugs on their goddamn
white liberal conscience.


1140
01:22:16.310 --> 01:22:17.277
Every march pulls 'em.

1141
01:22:17.350 --> 01:22:20.320
Especially when people
are getting beat up in the streets.


1142
01:22:23.790 --> 01:22:26.236
These pictures are
going around the world, Lee.


1143
01:22:26.630 --> 01:22:30.237
I understand, Mr. President.
All the more reason to act now.


1144
01:22:30.310 --> 01:22:31.357
I'm gonna act now.

1145
01:22:32.310 --> 01:22:34.916
You tell Wallace
and those backwater hicks


1146
01:22:34.990 --> 01:22:37.072
I don't want to see any more
of this horseshit.


1147
01:22:37.150 --> 01:22:40.279
And you tell King he best not march,
you hear me?


1148
01:22:40.350 --> 01:22:43.797
Either King stops and Wallace stops,

1149
01:22:43.870 --> 01:22:45.838
or I'll stop 'em both.

1150
01:22:45.990 --> 01:22:49.437
I'm here on the President's order
to try and make this work.


1151
01:22:50.710 --> 01:22:52.235
Please work with me.

1152
01:22:53.510 --> 01:22:55.353
So we give up the march and you...

1153
01:22:56.390 --> 01:22:57.755
You give what?

1154
01:22:58.710 --> 01:23:00.235
We asked for federal protection.

1155
01:23:00.310 --> 01:23:01.800
And with no disrespect,

1156
01:23:01.870 --> 01:23:03.360
but when the Assistant Attorney General

1157
01:23:03.430 --> 01:23:05.512
is the highest-ranking
federal official in Selma,


1158
01:23:05.590 --> 01:23:07.797
we have our answer.

1159
01:23:07.910 --> 01:23:09.150
And it's not the one we want.

1160
01:23:09.230 --> 01:23:13.952
Might I suggest that
you speak with Governor Wallace


1161
01:23:14.030 --> 01:23:16.636
and Sheriff Clark
and urge them against violence


1162
01:23:16.750 --> 01:23:20.391
instead of trying to persuade us
not to have a peaceful protest?


1163
01:23:26.270 --> 01:23:28.193
Maybe we can make a deal.

1164
01:23:29.470 --> 01:23:31.120
What if I

1165
01:23:31.790 --> 01:23:33.997
could assure you that the administration

1166
01:23:34.070 --> 01:23:36.755
would endorse a later march

1167
01:23:37.230 --> 01:23:38.561
if tomorrow is called off?

1168
01:23:40.270 --> 01:23:44.559
You know what?
He's closer than you may think


1169
01:23:44.630 --> 01:23:47.281
to coming around on this issue.

1170
01:23:48.190 --> 01:23:50.716
I believe this compromise
might be agreeable.


1171
01:23:50.790 --> 01:23:52.030
Mr. Doar?

1172
01:23:53.070 --> 01:23:57.598
Thousands have gathered here
to demonstrate their dignity.


1173
01:23:59.270 --> 01:24:01.159
I don't want to
challenge Judge Johnson.


1174
01:24:01.230 --> 01:24:04.439
I don't want to go against the President.
I don't want any of this.


1175
01:24:05.270 --> 01:24:08.035
The President could stop this
with a stroke of his pen.


1176
01:24:08.110 --> 01:24:10.238
He chooses not to.

1177
01:24:10.310 --> 01:24:12.790
The decision is with your side, sir,

1178
01:24:13.830 --> 01:24:14.991
not ours.

1179
01:24:24.350 --> 01:24:26.114
Good to see you, Father.
Good to see you.


1180
01:24:26.190 --> 01:24:27.555
Thank you for coming.
Thank you for coming out.


1181
01:24:27.630 --> 01:24:29.553
Hello, sister.
Good to see you this afternoon.


1182
01:24:31.510 --> 01:24:33.000
You came.

1183
01:24:33.190 --> 01:24:36.876
You called and we came, my friend.
You are not alone, my friend.


1184
01:24:36.950 --> 01:24:38.111
Welcome, welcome.

1185
01:24:38.190 --> 01:24:39.635
- Hi, what's your name?
- Susan.


1186
01:24:39.750 --> 01:24:41.434
Hi, I'm Viola. 
Welcome to Selma.

1187
01:24:42.070 --> 01:24:44.357
- Yes, ma'am, I'm good. How are you?
- Fine, thank you.


1188
01:24:44.430 --> 01:24:46.034
What is your name
and where are you from, sir?


1189
01:24:46.110 --> 01:24:48.920
My name is James Reeb.
I've come from Boston.


1190
01:24:48.990 --> 01:24:52.312
Tell me, why have you traveled here,
Mr. Reeb?


1191
01:24:52.950 --> 01:24:56.750
I heard about the attack
of innocent people


1192
01:24:56.830 --> 01:24:58.195
who just want their rights,

1193
01:24:58.510 --> 01:25:03.471
and I couldn't just stand by
when Dr. King put out that call to clergy.


1194
01:25:03.550 --> 01:25:04.756
I couldn't.

1195
01:25:04.950 --> 01:25:07.681
<i>The President doesn't
want us to march today.</i>


1196
01:25:08.350 --> 01:25:10.637
<i>The courts don't want us to march.</i>

1197
01:25:10.790 --> 01:25:11.791
<i>But we must march.</i>

1198
01:25:11.870 --> 01:25:12.917
Yeah!

1199
01:25:12.990 --> 01:25:14.719
<i>- We must stand up.</i>
- Yeah!


1200
01:25:14.790 --> 01:25:18.636
<i>We must make a massive
demonstration of our moral certainty.</i>


1201
01:25:22.350 --> 01:25:26.071
<i>I'm so glad we're here together today.</i>

1202
01:25:26.350 --> 01:25:28.717
<i>I thank you for standing up.</i>

1203
01:25:28.910 --> 01:25:32.073
<i>For we shall be victorious in our quest.</i>

1204
01:25:32.150 --> 01:25:35.120
<i>We shall cross the finish line
hand in hand.</i>


1205
01:25:36.550 --> 01:25:40.680
<i>For we shall overcome. 
All right.</i>

1206
01:27:17.830 --> 01:27:20.515
<i>Troopers, withdraw!</i>

1207
01:29:46.630 --> 01:29:48.632
My point is,
after what happened the last time,


1208
01:29:48.710 --> 01:29:50.838
if it don't feel right, we don't do it.
That's my point.


1209
01:29:50.910 --> 01:29:52.753
We've been going round
and round on this for hours,


1210
01:29:52.830 --> 01:29:54.355
and nothing's gonna
change the fact that


1211
01:29:54.430 --> 01:29:56.319
it was Doc's decision
and we have to support him.


1212
01:29:56.390 --> 01:29:57.960
This is a movement
of many, not of one.

1213
01:29:58.070 --> 01:29:59.595
So any choice we make
has to be right for many.


1214
01:29:59.670 --> 01:30:00.910
Come on, Diane. Now, you know

1215
01:30:01.030 --> 01:30:02.191
that's not what I
meant by that, all right?

1216
01:30:02.270 --> 01:30:04.557
People are angry, Dr. King.

1217
01:30:05.070 --> 01:30:09.917
Angry. They went back to that bridge
because they were hot about Sunday.


1218
01:30:09.990 --> 01:30:11.913
That was our moment out there today.

1219
01:30:11.990 --> 01:30:13.355
And you threw it away.

1220
01:30:13.910 --> 01:30:16.356
They could've sealed off
the road behind us.


1221
01:30:16.430 --> 01:30:20.355
No food, water,
no kind of support allowed through.


1222
01:30:21.150 --> 01:30:22.640
We wouldn't have made 10 miles.

1223
01:30:22.710 --> 01:30:24.075
You saying this was a trap?

1224
01:30:27.510 --> 01:30:28.841
I don't know what it was.

1225
01:30:29.550 --> 01:30:31.757
That was no trap!

1226
01:30:31.830 --> 01:30:33.719
You know why they opened up
the road to us?


1227
01:30:34.150 --> 01:30:37.074
Because all them nice,
respectable white folks was with us,


1228
01:30:37.190 --> 01:30:38.954
and we should've capitalized on that.

1229
01:30:39.030 --> 01:30:41.317
Because they're not gonna be
around here for long. They never are!


1230
01:30:41.390 --> 01:30:43.631
It was Martin's call. It's done.

1231
01:30:43.710 --> 01:30:45.519
He made the wrong goddamn call!

1232
01:30:45.590 --> 01:30:46.955
Hey, watch your mouth, young man!

1233
01:30:47.030 --> 01:30:49.636
Two days ago,
you didn't wanna march at all.


1234
01:30:49.710 --> 01:30:52.111
And now you're mad because
it didn't go the way you planned?


1235
01:30:52.190 --> 01:30:53.874
Calm down, brother.

1236
01:30:57.910 --> 01:31:01.437
Now, what happened out there today?
You gotta tell us something. Please.


1237
01:31:09.110 --> 01:31:11.841
I'd rather people be upset and hate me

1238
01:31:11.910 --> 01:31:14.914
than be bleeding or dead.

1239
01:32:09.910 --> 01:32:12.561
<i>My dearest Corrie,</i>

1240
01:32:14.550 --> 01:32:16.632
<i>at a time when I need you,</i>

1241
01:32:17.630 --> 01:32:19.598
<i>I cannot call you.</i>

1242
01:32:21.110 --> 01:32:25.832
<i>And I have done
this to myself, to us.</i>

1243
01:32:29.470 --> 01:32:31.518
<i>At this late hour,</i>

1244
01:32:32.710 --> 01:32:34.997
<i>my thoughts are of you</i>

1245
01:32:35.110 --> 01:32:38.876
<i>and all you have sacrificed
for this struggle.</i>


1246
01:32:40.390 --> 01:32:43.360
<i>So many have sacrificed.</i>

1247
01:32:44.430 --> 01:32:46.876
<i>So many have been lost.</i>

1248
01:32:48.150 --> 01:32:51.757
<i>I wonder how many must we lose.</i>

1249
01:32:55.670 --> 01:33:00.801
<i>I pray for discernment and guidance
as we journey on.</i>


1250
01:33:02.390 --> 01:33:06.952
<i>I pray, too, that I can justify
the faith you once had in me.</i>


1251
01:33:09.630 --> 01:33:16.275
<i>I, too, often feel that
heavy fog you spoke of, Corrie.</i>


1252
01:33:18.790 --> 01:33:23.796
<i>Only you and our family clears the haze.</i>

1253
01:33:26.190 --> 01:33:29.080
<i>Love, Martin.</i>

1254
01:33:31.950 --> 01:33:33.156
<i>He betrayed trust.</i>

1255
01:33:33.630 --> 01:33:36.839
He called, we came,
and he didn't fulfill his own call.


1256
01:33:36.910 --> 01:33:39.038
Yeah, but sometimes
it's not that clear-cut.


1257
01:33:39.110 --> 01:33:41.397
Sometimes it's instinctual.

1258
01:33:42.350 --> 01:33:44.034
Like when you're preaching,

1259
01:33:44.710 --> 01:33:46.439
and you're just flying.

1260
01:33:47.710 --> 01:33:50.873
You know, you're not on the notes.
You're not on memory.


1261
01:33:50.950 --> 01:33:55.433
You're tapped into what's higher,
what's true.


1262
01:33:56.310 --> 01:33:57.641
God is guiding you.

1263
01:33:59.310 --> 01:34:02.519
I've known that feeling.
It's rare, but I've known it.


1264
01:34:05.990 --> 01:34:09.790
I think that's what happened to Dr. King
up there on the bridge today.


1265
01:34:09.870 --> 01:34:12.350
He kneeled down,
prayed to God and got an answer.


1266
01:34:12.430 --> 01:34:15.320
And he was brave enough
to follow that answer,


1267
01:34:15.390 --> 01:34:18.280
and I, for one,
don't fault him for it.

1268
01:34:18.350 --> 01:34:20.637
Except he owes me a bus ticket home.

1269
01:34:21.310 --> 01:34:22.675
You know what
I hate more than niggers?


1270
01:34:22.790 --> 01:34:24.121
What's that?

1271
01:34:24.750 --> 01:34:25.876
White niggers.

1272
01:34:26.790 --> 01:34:28.315
Look, we don't want trouble, okay?

1273
01:34:28.390 --> 01:34:30.154
No, you came here stirrin' trouble.

1274
01:34:47.550 --> 01:34:48.597
Doc,

1275
01:34:50.510 --> 01:34:51.875
someone's been hurt.

1276
01:34:56.630 --> 01:34:59.679
A priest, from Boston.

1277
01:35:01.230 --> 01:35:02.391
<i>White.</i>

1278
01:35:03.670 --> 01:35:06.321
Now you know what
being a nigger around here


1279
01:35:06.390 --> 01:35:08.154
feels like, boy.

1280
01:35:08.670 --> 01:35:10.957
Hurt? How?

1281
01:35:17.830 --> 01:35:18.956
Dead.

1282
01:35:34.790 --> 01:35:36.315
I need a phone!

1283
01:35:37.670 --> 01:35:41.561
Chicago, Detroit, Boston, I don't care.

1284
01:35:41.630 --> 01:35:44.236
Hell, you got 2,000 people
marching up in Harlem.


1285
01:35:44.310 --> 01:35:45.391
Well, good for you.

1286
01:35:45.470 --> 01:35:48.041
<i>But when you have people
come inside the White House?</i>


1287
01:35:48.110 --> 01:35:50.795
Inside the White House! On a tour?

1288
01:35:51.150 --> 01:35:52.436
<i>They just sat down, Martin.</i>

1289
01:35:52.510 --> 01:35:55.195
They sat down in the main corridor,
started singin' and shoutin'.


1290
01:35:55.350 --> 01:35:56.511
Well, I won't have it!

1291
01:35:56.590 --> 01:35:58.001
I cannot stop people from expressing...

1292
01:35:58.070 --> 01:35:59.754
You can! You can stop them.

1293
01:36:00.030 --> 01:36:03.716
No, you can stop it.
You, sir, can do more.


1294
01:36:03.790 --> 01:36:06.953
Now I'm glad to hear that you
called Reverend Reeb's widow, sir.


1295
01:36:07.030 --> 01:36:08.998
That is very fine, and it is right.

1296
01:36:09.070 --> 01:36:11.038
<i>I only wish that
Jimmie Lee Jackson's family</i>


1297
01:36:11.150 --> 01:36:12.640
would have received
the same consideration


1298
01:36:12.710 --> 01:36:13.757
from their President.

1299
01:36:13.830 --> 01:36:15.832
Don't you lay your guilt at my door.

1300
01:36:15.910 --> 01:36:17.321
You're the one choosing to send

1301
01:36:17.390 --> 01:36:20.041
people out to slaughter
when we told you there was trouble.


1302
01:36:20.110 --> 01:36:21.271
<i>We won't sit idle</i>

1303
01:36:21.350 --> 01:36:24.115
while you wait another year or two
to send this bill up at your leisure.


1304
01:36:24.190 --> 01:36:26.272
<i>That should be clear by now.</i>

1305
01:36:26.350 --> 01:36:30.196
<i>We will continue to demonstrate
until you take action, sir.</i>


1306
01:36:30.270 --> 01:36:32.432
<i>And if our President
won't protect our rights,</i>


1307
01:36:32.510 --> 01:36:33.921
<i>we will take this fight to court.</i>

1308
01:36:34.990 --> 01:36:37.277
You know, I'm... 
I'm trying here.

1309
01:36:37.350 --> 01:36:39.000
We're getting close
to figuring something out


1310
01:36:39.070 --> 01:36:41.994
on this voting thing,
but I will not have this!


1311
01:36:43.390 --> 01:36:47.076
<i>This bill has been almost impossible
to craft, you hear me?</i>


1312
01:36:47.150 --> 01:36:50.552
<i>You think you're jugglin', Martin?
I'm jugglin', too.</i>


1313
01:36:52.310 --> 01:36:54.438
I am a preacher from Atlanta.

1314
01:36:54.830 --> 01:36:56.832
You are the man
who won the presidency


1315
01:36:56.910 --> 01:36:58.639
of the world's most powerful nation

1316
01:36:58.710 --> 01:37:02.032
<i>by the greatest landslide
in history four months ago.</i>


1317
01:37:02.390 --> 01:37:03.630
<i>And you are the man</i>

1318
01:37:03.710 --> 01:37:07.920
dismantling your own legacy
with each passing day.


1319
01:37:09.310 --> 01:37:11.392
<i>No one will remember
the Civil Rights Act.</i>


1320
01:37:11.910 --> 01:37:14.516
But they will remember
the standoff in Selma


1321
01:37:14.630 --> 01:37:17.315
when you never even
set foot in this state.


1322
01:37:17.390 --> 01:37:20.951
<i>They will remember you saying,
"Wait," and "I can't,"</i>


1323
01:37:21.030 --> 01:37:24.432
unless you act, sir.

1324
01:37:36.270 --> 01:37:38.159
- Evenin'.
- Evenin'.


1325
01:37:54.310 --> 01:37:56.631
I wanted to speak privately.

1326
01:37:57.590 --> 01:38:00.355
I know there's been trouble
with the group,


1327
01:38:00.430 --> 01:38:04.799
and I apologize that our efforts
have caused a rift between y'all.


1328
01:38:06.470 --> 01:38:10.111
That's a painful thing, I know,
and I'm truly sorry it's happened.


1329
01:38:11.590 --> 01:38:14.594
Yeah, painful.

1330
01:38:20.430 --> 01:38:23.161
LBJ is not moving, John.

1331
01:38:24.390 --> 01:38:26.916
I thought he would,
but our efforts are not working,


1332
01:38:26.990 --> 01:38:29.357
and I can't risk another march
with people getting killed


1333
01:38:29.430 --> 01:38:31.194
when it's not working. 
I won't do it.

1334
01:38:32.310 --> 01:38:35.393
We need voting, not marching.
You know that.


1335
01:38:36.190 --> 01:38:40.639
We have to move beyond these protests
to some real political power.


1336
01:38:40.710 --> 01:38:43.031
This can't go on forever like this.

1337
01:38:44.710 --> 01:38:46.678
I can't go on like this.

1338
01:39:02.510 --> 01:39:04.080
When I was...

1339
01:39:06.030 --> 01:39:09.955
When I was working with SNCC
on the Freedom Rides,


1340
01:39:12.630 --> 01:39:16.112
the Montgomery bus
reached the city limits.


1341
01:39:17.790 --> 01:39:20.236
We got off. And out of nowhere,

1342
01:39:21.630 --> 01:39:25.601
from all directions, they came.

1343
01:39:28.310 --> 01:39:31.598
There was men, women.

1344
01:39:33.710 --> 01:39:35.155
Kids, too.

1345
01:39:38.270 --> 01:39:42.639
They had just about every makeshift
weapon you could think of.


1346
01:39:42.710 --> 01:39:45.441
I mean, bats, bricks,

1347
01:39:46.710 --> 01:39:50.271
tire irons, pipes.

1348
01:39:54.070 --> 01:39:55.799
I remember...

1349
01:39:57.230 --> 01:40:01.394
I remember this little girl
just clawing her nails


1350
01:40:01.470 --> 01:40:05.395
into the side of my friend Jessie's face

1351
01:40:05.510 --> 01:40:09.595
while her daddy...
Her daddy beat him with an ax handle.


1352
01:40:12.710 --> 01:40:14.519
Jessie was unconscious,

1353
01:40:14.590 --> 01:40:18.072
and they just kept beating on him
and beating on him.


1354
01:40:22.110 --> 01:40:25.432
I must've passed out
on the asphalt somewhere.


1355
01:40:29.030 --> 01:40:34.833
Next day, I found myself patched up
and sitting in a church.


1356
01:40:35.630 --> 01:40:39.191
I could barely hold my head up,
but I needed to be there.


1357
01:40:41.110 --> 01:40:43.192
You were gonna be speaking.

1358
01:40:44.070 --> 01:40:46.232
And I needed to hear you.

1359
01:40:48.910 --> 01:40:51.834
And I was feeling down,
but you got up there.


1360
01:40:54.430 --> 01:40:56.000
You remember that day at all?

1361
01:40:57.710 --> 01:41:00.520
I don't think we remember it
the same way.


1362
01:41:02.030 --> 01:41:03.634
What'd I say, John?

1363
01:41:04.990 --> 01:41:07.311
I'm about to tell you right now.

1364
01:41:08.630 --> 01:41:10.519
And I hope you hear me.

1365
01:41:12.830 --> 01:41:15.276
You said that we would triumph.

1366
01:41:16.070 --> 01:41:19.677
That we would triumph
because there could be no other way.


1367
01:41:23.750 --> 01:41:25.673
And you know what else you said?

1368
01:41:30.710 --> 01:41:31.757
You said,

1369
01:41:32.750 --> 01:41:34.195
"Fear not.

1370
01:41:35.590 --> 01:41:38.594
"We've come too far to turn back now."

1371
01:41:50.590 --> 01:41:54.117
I feel good about where we are.
We have a strong case.


1372
01:41:54.190 --> 01:41:55.521
- We can do this.
- Right.


1373
01:41:56.870 --> 01:41:59.919
Now, Ms. Cooper
and Ms. Boynton are here,


1374
01:41:59.990 --> 01:42:02.277
and they need to be ready.

1375
01:42:03.630 --> 01:42:06.634
A lot depends
on what they have to say. Okay?


1376
01:42:06.710 --> 01:42:08.200
I hear what you're saying, but...

1377
01:42:30.190 --> 01:42:31.555
You're here.

1378
01:42:34.030 --> 01:42:35.839
Yes, I'm here.

1379
01:42:41.510 --> 01:42:42.750
I'm glad.

1380
01:42:56.750 --> 01:42:58.718
Just in time.

1381
01:42:59.070 --> 01:43:01.437
In the matter of the <i>Southern
Christian Leadership Conference</i>


1382
01:43:01.510 --> 01:43:02.921
<i>v. the state of Alabama,</i>

1383
01:43:02.990 --> 01:43:06.551
I will now hear testimony
from the plaintiffs. Mr. Gray.


1384
01:43:07.710 --> 01:43:10.031
Your Honor, you will hear testimony
from the victims


1385
01:43:10.150 --> 01:43:13.393
who were beaten and bludgeoned
in their quest for freedom.


1386
01:43:13.470 --> 01:43:16.440
For their right to vote
and to self-determine.


1387
01:43:17.150 --> 01:43:18.276
The fact of the matter, Your Honor,

1388
01:43:18.350 --> 01:43:21.320
is that the incidents that occurred
cannot be disputed.


1389
01:43:21.750 --> 01:43:24.151
These particular circumstances

1390
01:43:24.670 --> 01:43:30.120
will paint a thorough picture
of the horrific events endured in Selma.


1391
01:43:30.790 --> 01:43:32.997
Very well, you may proceed.

1392
01:43:33.070 --> 01:43:37.200
Mr. King, you went out on that bridge
in direct violation of that judge's orders.


1393
01:43:37.910 --> 01:43:41.357
You deliberately disobeyed this judge
and the Governor, did you not?


1394
01:43:42.630 --> 01:43:45.713
Thousands of people came to Selma,

1395
01:43:45.790 --> 01:43:48.794
aroused by Sunday's brutal acts

1396
01:43:49.190 --> 01:43:52.876
exacted by officials of the city of Selma

1397
01:43:52.950 --> 01:43:54.793
and the state of Alabama.

1398
01:43:54.870 --> 01:43:57.874
I felt if I
had not led the march,

1399
01:43:57.990 --> 01:44:02.234
pent-up emotions and inner tensions
would have led to an uncontrollable


1400
01:44:02.310 --> 01:44:04.392
retaliatory situation,

1401
01:44:05.790 --> 01:44:08.236
a violent situation on both sides.

1402
01:44:08.310 --> 01:44:10.119
I don't need any of your preaching
and prancing in here,


1403
01:44:10.190 --> 01:44:11.476
you hear? I want an answer.

1404
01:44:11.550 --> 01:44:14.076
- Objection.
- Watch it, counselor.


1405
01:44:14.590 --> 01:44:15.830
I'm trying very hard, Judge.

1406
01:44:16.190 --> 01:44:17.555
Try harder, counselor.

1407
01:44:23.230 --> 01:44:26.439
<i>It seems basic to
our constitutional principles</i>


1408
01:44:26.510 --> 01:44:29.719
<i>that the extent of the right to assemble,</i>

1409
01:44:30.510 --> 01:44:32.274
<i>and demonstrate and march</i>

1410
01:44:32.350 --> 01:44:34.000
<i>along the highway in a peaceful manner</i>

1411
01:44:34.110 --> 01:44:35.760
<i>ought to be commensurate</i>

1412
01:44:35.830 --> 01:44:38.037
<i>with the enormity of the wrongs</i>

1413
01:44:38.110 --> 01:44:40.841
<i>that are being protested
and petitioned against.</i>


1414
01:44:41.670 --> 01:44:46.198
<i>In this case, the wrongs are enormous.</i>

1415
01:44:48.670 --> 01:44:49.796
<i>Therefore,</i>

1416
01:44:50.790 --> 01:44:54.033
the extent of the right to demonstrate

1417
01:44:54.110 --> 01:44:57.592
in an estimated five-day march
from Selma to Montgomery


1418
01:44:58.270 --> 01:44:59.954
has been approved accordingly.

1419
01:45:00.230 --> 01:45:02.232
- Yes!
- Thank God!


1420
01:45:04.030 --> 01:45:06.795
There's no further business
with this court.


1421
01:45:06.870 --> 01:45:10.591
These proceedings are concluded,
with our thanks to the litigants.


1422
01:45:11.910 --> 01:45:13.719
Good day, gentlemen.

1423
01:45:29.150 --> 01:45:30.197
Yeah, that's right.

1424
01:45:30.270 --> 01:45:33.080
Well, now, we don't like
to have no mistakes, if you...


1425
01:45:33.150 --> 01:45:34.311
If you're sure about it.

1426
01:45:35.390 --> 01:45:39.031
Bayard says that Harry says
he can get Nina Simone,


1427
01:45:39.110 --> 01:45:43.240
Dick Gregory, Joan Baez,
Peter, Paul and Mary in.


1428
01:45:44.190 --> 01:45:45.794
Come on now.
We don't got money for that.


1429
01:45:45.870 --> 01:45:48.350
Well, Harry is chartering
a plane himself.


1430
01:45:48.470 --> 01:45:51.440
<i>Day
-O, day
-O</i>

1431
01:45:52.350 --> 01:45:56.241
<i>Daylight come
and me wan' go home</i>


1432
01:45:56.310 --> 01:46:01.680
President's angling for your blocking
of the march to be overturned.


1433
01:46:02.350 --> 01:46:04.956
Unfortunately, all my maneuvers
have been put on hold


1434
01:46:05.030 --> 01:46:07.874
while the matter's being adjudicated.

1435
01:46:16.390 --> 01:46:17.630
<i>Governor, you wanted to talk.</i>

1436
01:46:18.630 --> 01:46:20.837
Well, Mr. President...

1437
01:46:21.430 --> 01:46:27.278
Malcontents are disrupting Alabama,
and it's your responsibility to stop them.


1438
01:46:28.030 --> 01:46:30.715
They're protesting about the right to vote

1439
01:46:30.790 --> 01:46:34.112
and the way they're treated in your state.

1440
01:46:34.230 --> 01:46:38.394
So that's your problem,
your responsibility,


1441
01:46:38.470 --> 01:46:40.472
and it's on your watch.

1442
01:46:41.150 --> 01:46:43.198
Mr. President, I disagree.

1443
01:46:43.830 --> 01:46:47.232
We have a certain way things are done.
It's the way it is.


1444
01:46:47.310 --> 01:46:49.472
And it's the way
the people want it to stay.


1445
01:46:51.630 --> 01:46:53.917
George, why are you doing this?

1446
01:46:53.990 --> 01:46:55.913
Your whole career
has been working for the poor.


1447
01:46:55.990 --> 01:46:57.674
Why are you off on this black thing?

1448
01:46:58.190 --> 01:47:00.841
Well, 'cause you can't ever satisfy them.

1449
01:47:01.910 --> 01:47:03.753
First, it's the front seat of the bus.

1450
01:47:03.830 --> 01:47:06.515
Next, it's take over the parks,

1451
01:47:06.590 --> 01:47:10.879
then it's the public schools,
then it's voting, then it's jobs,


1452
01:47:11.150 --> 01:47:14.359
then it's distribution of wealth
without work.


1453
01:47:17.030 --> 01:47:18.919
George, you seen
all those demonstrators


1454
01:47:18.990 --> 01:47:20.321
out front of the White House

1455
01:47:20.390 --> 01:47:22.597
keeping my Lady Bird awake
the whole damn night?


1456
01:47:22.670 --> 01:47:24.638
Oh, yes, Mr. President. I saw them.

1457
01:47:24.710 --> 01:47:27.600
Well, let's go out there, you and I,

1458
01:47:27.670 --> 01:47:31.311
and announce that you've decided to
let the blacks vote undeterred,


1459
01:47:31.750 --> 01:47:33.479
and this whole mess will go away.

1460
01:47:33.550 --> 01:47:36.520
And I don't have to draft bills
or force the issue.


1461
01:47:37.110 --> 01:47:39.795
Now, why don't we do that, George?

1462
01:47:39.870 --> 01:47:42.714
Why don't you just let the niggers vote?

1463
01:47:43.550 --> 01:47:45.712
You agree they got the right to vote,
don't you?


1464
01:47:45.790 --> 01:47:47.633
There's no quarrel with that.

1465
01:47:47.710 --> 01:47:49.792
I know that. That's the law.

1466
01:47:50.710 --> 01:47:52.553
Then why don't you just let 'em vote?

1467
01:47:52.950 --> 01:47:55.715
I don't have that power.
It belongs to the county registrars.


1468
01:47:55.790 --> 01:47:58.680
Now, don't shit me
about who runs Alabama.


1469
01:47:59.830 --> 01:48:01.480
I don't have any legal power

1470
01:48:01.550 --> 01:48:04.360
over the county registrars,
Mr. President.


1471
01:48:04.630 --> 01:48:06.712
They have their regulations
and they adhere.


1472
01:48:07.390 --> 01:48:10.200
Are you trying to shit me,
George Wallace?


1473
01:48:10.270 --> 01:48:12.557
Are you trying
to fuck over your President?


1474
01:48:12.630 --> 01:48:13.836
Mr. President...

1475
01:48:13.910 --> 01:48:16.151
We shouldn't even
be thinking about 1965.


1476
01:48:16.230 --> 01:48:18.961
We should be thinking about 1985.

1477
01:48:19.670 --> 01:48:21.798
You and I'll be
both dead and gone by then.


1478
01:48:22.950 --> 01:48:25.157
In 1985, what do you want looking back?

1479
01:48:25.230 --> 01:48:26.994
You want people
remembering you sayin',


1480
01:48:27.070 --> 01:48:31.519
"Wait," or "I can't," or, "It's too hard"?

1481
01:48:34.430 --> 01:48:37.434
I don't right care what they think,

1482
01:48:37.550 --> 01:48:39.917
and you shouldn't neither.

1483
01:48:44.750 --> 01:48:45.911
Well...

1484
01:48:47.350 --> 01:48:49.478
I'll be damned if I'm gonna let history

1485
01:48:49.550 --> 01:48:52.918
put me in the same place
as the likes of you.


1486
01:48:56.950 --> 01:49:00.033
<i>I speak tonight for the dignity of man</i>

1487
01:49:00.710 --> 01:49:03.793
<i>and the destiny of democracy.</i>

1488
01:49:04.670 --> 01:49:07.992
<i>At times, history and fate</i>

1489
01:49:08.070 --> 01:49:11.961
<i>meet at a single
time in a single place.</i>

1490
01:49:13.190 --> 01:49:18.117
<i>So it was last week in Selma, Alabama.</i>

1491
01:49:19.430 --> 01:49:22.434
<i>There, long suffering men and women</i>

1492
01:49:22.790 --> 01:49:28.399
<i>peacefully protested the denial
of their rights as Americans.</i>


1493
01:49:28.470 --> 01:49:30.632
<i>Rarely in any time</i>

1494
01:49:30.710 --> 01:49:34.112
<i>does an issue lay bare the secret heart</i>

1495
01:49:34.910 --> 01:49:36.878
<i>of America itself.</i>

1496
01:49:37.830 --> 01:49:42.392
<i>The issue for equal rights
for the American Negro</i>


1497
01:49:42.470 --> 01:49:44.313
<i>is that issue.</i>

1498
01:49:45.030 --> 01:49:46.156
<i>For this issue,</i>

1499
01:49:46.990 --> 01:49:50.676
<i>many of them were brutally assaulted.</i>

1500
01:49:54.510 --> 01:49:58.913
<i>There is no Negro problem.
There is no Southern problem.</i>


1501
01:49:59.670 --> 01:50:02.674
<i>There is only an American problem.</i>

1502
01:50:05.830 --> 01:50:08.674
<i>The Constitution says that</i>

1503
01:50:08.750 --> 01:50:12.311
<i>no person shall be kept from voting</i>

1504
01:50:12.390 --> 01:50:15.041
<i>because of his race or color.</i>

1505
01:50:16.270 --> 01:50:20.275
<i>To correct the denial
of this fundamental right,</i>


1506
01:50:20.350 --> 01:50:24.878
<i>this Wednesday,
I will send to Congress a law</i>


1507
01:50:24.950 --> 01:50:29.035
<i>designed to eliminate
these illegal barriers.</i>


1508
01:50:29.590 --> 01:50:31.991
<i>The bill will strike down</i>

1509
01:50:32.070 --> 01:50:35.836
<i>voting restrictions in all elections,</i>

1510
01:50:35.910 --> 01:50:39.631
<i>federal, state and local.</i>

1511
01:50:41.390 --> 01:50:43.358
<i>And we shall do this.</i>

1512
01:50:45.430 --> 01:50:48.718
<i>We shall overcome.</i>

1513
01:51:06.310 --> 01:51:08.472
We believe we can cover you
through Lowndes County,


1514
01:51:08.550 --> 01:51:12.157
but once we add the final day's march
through Montgomery,


1515
01:51:12.230 --> 01:51:14.881
and you're passing through
all those tall buildings and whatnot,


1516
01:51:14.950 --> 01:51:16.918
coverage becomes challenging.

1517
01:51:18.590 --> 01:51:20.991
So please consider

1518
01:51:22.150 --> 01:51:23.720
driving in on the final leg.

1519
01:51:23.790 --> 01:51:27.351
And please consider nixing
the speech at the Capitol.


1520
01:51:29.590 --> 01:51:31.752
Well, if Wallace will see us
when we arrive,


1521
01:51:31.830 --> 01:51:33.912
there'll be no need for a speech.

1522
01:51:35.190 --> 01:51:36.874
Can you arrange that?

1523
01:51:42.550 --> 01:51:43.961
I can't hide.

1524
01:51:45.590 --> 01:51:48.275
We can't hide. 
You understand.

1525
01:51:52.190 --> 01:51:54.841
I don't want to see
this go wrong for you.

1526
01:51:57.270 --> 01:51:59.637
Don't you want
to protect yourself, Doctor?


1527
01:52:01.390 --> 01:52:03.472
Let me try to do that.

1528
01:52:05.790 --> 01:52:07.554
You know, I know you
want to live to see

1529
01:52:07.630 --> 01:52:10.031
the fruits of all this work. 
I know you do.

1530
01:52:12.950 --> 01:52:16.750
I'm just asking you to allow us
to help you do that.


1531
01:52:24.470 --> 01:52:26.950
I'm no different than anybody else.

1532
01:52:28.990 --> 01:52:31.755
I want to live long and be happy.

1533
01:52:33.990 --> 01:52:37.312
But I'll not be focusing
on what I want today.


1534
01:52:38.990 --> 01:52:41.391
I'm focused on what God wants.

1535
01:52:44.670 --> 01:52:49.153
We're here for a reason,
through many, many storms.


1536
01:52:53.510 --> 01:52:57.231
But, today, the sun is shining,
and I'm about to stand in its warmth


1537
01:52:57.310 --> 01:53:01.713
alongside a lot of freedom-loving people
who worked hard to get us here.


1538
01:53:03.150 --> 01:53:07.200
I may not be with them
for all the sunny days to come,


1539
01:53:09.190 --> 01:53:12.194
but as long as there
is light ahead for them,


1540
01:53:14.190 --> 01:53:16.113
it's worth it to me.

1541
01:53:25.550 --> 01:53:27.200
Thank you, John.

1542
01:55:11.150 --> 01:55:15.394
<i>We heard them say
we'd never make it here.</i>


1543
01:55:17.310 --> 01:55:21.872
<i>We heard them say they'd stop us,
if it was the last thing they did.</i>


1544
01:55:23.870 --> 01:55:27.875
<i>We heard them say
we don't deserve to be here.</i>


1545
01:55:29.870 --> 01:55:33.920
<i>But today, we stand as Americans.</i>

1546
01:55:37.670 --> 01:55:39.240
<i>We are here,</i>

1547
01:55:40.110 --> 01:55:43.273
<i>and we ain't gonna let nobody
turn us around.</i>


1548
01:55:44.670 --> 01:55:47.241
<i>This mighty march,</i>

1549
01:55:48.070 --> 01:55:50.357
<i>which will be counted
as one of the greatest</i>


1550
01:55:50.430 --> 01:55:54.276
<i>demonstrations of protest and progress,</i>

1551

<i>ends here in the Capitol of Alabama</i>

1552
01:55:58.070 --> 01:56:00.152
<i>for a vital purpose.</i>

1553
01:56:00.710 --> 01:56:04.954
<i>We have not fought only
for the right to sit where we please</i>


1554
01:56:05.030 --> 01:56:08.113
<i>and go to school where we please.</i>

1555
01:56:08.190 --> 01:56:12.400
<i>We do not only strive here today
to vote as we please.</i>


1556
01:56:13.550 --> 01:56:15.314
<i>But with our commitment,</i>

1557
01:56:15.390 --> 01:56:19.554
<i>we give birth each
day to a new energy</i>

1558
01:56:19.630 --> 01:56:23.191
<i>that is stronger than
our strongest opposition.</i>


1559
01:56:25.390 --> 01:56:28.758
<i>And we embrace
this new energy so boldly,</i>


1560
01:56:28.830 --> 01:56:31.276
<i>embody it so fervently,</i>

1561
01:56:31.350 --> 01:56:34.513
<i>that its reflection illuminates
a great darkness.</i>


1562
01:56:37.390 --> 01:56:40.678
<i>Our society has distorted who we are.</i>

1563
01:56:41.870 --> 01:56:44.521
<i>From slavery to the Reconstruction</i>

1564
01:56:44.950 --> 01:56:48.318
<i>to the precipice at which we now stand,</i>

1565
01:56:48.390 --> 01:56:54.193
<i>we have seen powerful
white men rule the world</i>


1566
01:56:54.630 --> 01:56:59.511
<i>while offering poor white men
a vicious lie as placation.</i>


1567
01:57:00.590 --> 01:57:03.514
<i>And when the poor white man's children</i>

1568
01:57:03.590 --> 01:57:07.072
<i>wail with a hunger
that cannot be satisfied,</i>


1569
01:57:07.670 --> 01:57:11.277
<i>he feeds them that same vicious lie.</i>

1570
01:57:12.390 --> 01:57:14.711
<i>A lie whispering to them</i>

1571
01:57:15.270 --> 01:57:17.591
<i>that regardless of their lot in life,</i>

1572
01:57:18.430 --> 01:57:22.116
<i>they can at least be triumphant
in the knowledge</i>


1573
01:57:22.190 --> 01:57:26.991
<i>that their whiteness makes
them superior to blackness.</i>


1574
01:57:27.470 --> 01:57:28.960
<i>But we know the truth.</i>

1575
01:57:30.350 --> 01:57:35.516
<i>We know the truth, and we will
go forward to that truth, to freedom.</i>


1576
01:57:38.630 --> 01:57:40.519
<i>We will not be stopped.</i>

1577
01:57:42.310 --> 01:57:43.880
<i>We will march for our rights.</i>

1578
01:57:44.590 --> 01:57:48.675
<i>We will march to demand
treatment as full citizens.</i>


1579
01:57:48.790 --> 01:57:52.476
<i>We will march until the viciousness
and the darkness</i>


1580
01:57:52.550 --> 01:57:55.918
<i>gives way to the light of righteousness.</i>

1581
01:57:56.470 --> 01:58:00.475
<i>No man, no myth,</i>

1582
01:58:00.670 --> 01:58:04.994
<i>no malaise will stop this movement.</i>

1583
01:58:05.070 --> 01:58:09.758
<i>We forbid it.
For we know that it is this darkness</i>


1584
01:58:09.830 --> 01:58:13.994
<i>that murders the best in us
and the best of us.</i>


1585
01:58:15.510 --> 01:58:19.310
<i>Whether Jimmie Lee Jackson
or James Reeb,</i>


1586
01:58:21.030 --> 01:58:24.352
<i>or four blameless little girls</i>

1587
01:58:24.590 --> 01:58:28.720
<i>struck down
before they had even begun.</i>


1588
01:58:30.350 --> 01:58:35.436
<i>You may ask, when will we
be free of this darkness?</i>


1589
01:58:35.510 --> 01:58:38.036
<i>I say to you today,
my brothers and sisters,</i>


1590
01:58:38.350 --> 01:58:41.672
<i>despite the pain, despite the tears,</i>

1591
01:58:41.790 --> 01:58:44.316
<i>our freedom will soon be upon us.</i>

1592
01:58:47.230 --> 01:58:51.519
<i>For "truth crushed to earth
will rise again."</i>


1593
01:58:54.230 --> 01:58:56.631
<i>When will we be free?</i>

1594
01:58:57.510 --> 01:58:59.877
<i>Soon, and very soon.</i>

1595
01:58:59.950 --> 01:59:03.238
<i>Because you shall reap what you sow.</i>

1596
01:59:07.150 --> 01:59:08.640
<i>When will we be free?</i>

1597

<i>Soon, and very soon.</i>

1598

1600
