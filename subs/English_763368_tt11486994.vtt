00:04:07.106 --> 00:04:07.673

Alexa here.

39
00:04:13.812 --> 00:04:16.515
I just wanted to come on
and tell you guys that I know


40
00:04:16.548 --> 00:04:18.717
there's a lot of stigma online
about plastic surgery


41
00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.520
and the truth is honestly,

42
00:04:21.553 --> 00:04:24.322
everyone has the right to look
and feel their best.


43
00:04:24.356 --> 00:04:27.360
And I decided that

44
00:04:27.392 --> 00:04:29.628
I am going to get
a procedure done,


45
00:04:29.661 --> 00:04:31.563
um, with Dr. Bradford.

46
00:04:31.596 --> 00:04:34.133
And if you're willing to face
your fears...

00:04:38.704 --> 00:04:40.239
[Man 1] Since the
beginning, I see this girl.


48
00:04:40.272 --> 00:04:43.142
I'm like, ah, you know,

49
00:04:43.175 --> 00:04:45.377
I can't even find the right
words for it.


50
00:04:45.411 --> 00:04:47.113
You know, she's eh.

51
00:04:47.146 --> 00:04:49.247
Every time I see her,
I'm argh!


52
00:04:49.281 --> 00:04:50.316
You're right.

53
00:04:50.348 --> 00:04:51.584
Of course, I'm right.

54
00:04:51.617 --> 00:04:52.752
I'm French.

55
00:04:52.784 --> 00:04:54.719
French are always right.

56
00:04:54.752 --> 00:04:57.122
Everything that is French
is right.


57
00:04:57.156 --> 00:05:00.093
French fries, French toast,

00:05:00.125 --> 00:05:01.426
French kiss.

59
00:05:01.459 --> 00:05:03.228
So now you're going to forget
about this girl.

You are gonna go.

toast and French fries.

Why do you do this to yourself?

76
00:05:41.367 --> 00:05:42.502
Where were you?

77
00:05:42.534 --> 00:05:44.570
The doctors I told you.

78
00:05:44.603 --> 00:05:46.172
Why are you back so soon?

79
00:05:46.204 --> 00:05:48.541
Cause I can't go through
with it.


80
00:05:48.574 --> 00:05:49.809
Can't go through with what?

81
00:05:49.841 --> 00:05:51.877
The procedure, Matt.

82
00:05:51.911 --> 00:05:54.846
I don't want to talk about it.

83
00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.716
Sure you weren't with Trey?

84
00:05:57.849 --> 00:05:59.217
Are you serious?

85
00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:00.219
Yeah.

86
00:06:00.252 --> 00:06:01.787
I faked a doctor's appointment
so that I can go


87

You're sweeping through
my phone.

your phone.

surreptitious last night,

You're so insecure

96
00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:18.771
He's our friend, Matt.

97
00:06:18.805 --> 00:06:20.807
I should be able to text our
friends without your approval.


98

Just cut the shit, Lex.

and I don't like it.

00:06:39.959 --> 00:06:41.594
What?

107

She went away
from the rehab clinic again.

I don't know, I'll figure out
like I always do.


129
00:07:47.058 --> 00:07:48.791
Yeah, like you always do
is how you ended up there

in the first place.

Selling your body on the streets
for drug money.

End up homeless.

to you on a silver platter.

making it up

Well, Dr. Bennett

So tell me, Jessica,
sweet Jessica,


1014
01:03:42.711 --> 01:03:44.245
what seems to be the problem?

1015
01:03:44.278 --> 01:03:47.148
I've been having a lot
of chest pain that really,


1016
01:03:47.182 --> 01:03:50.051
you know, right by my breast
in this area.


1017
01:03:50.084 --> 01:03:52.954
This could be a very serious
problem.


1018

I can help you.

1019

Are you comfortable disrobing

1021
01:03:58.227 --> 01:04:00.296
Dr. Bennett,
I thought you'd never ask.


1022
01:04:00.328 --> 01:04:03.198
I actually didn't even wear
a bra just for this reason.


1023
01:04:03.232 --> 01:04:06.069
Oh, well,
you are a dream patient.


1024
01:04:08.236 --> 01:04:10.106
This is a problem.

1025
01:04:10.138 --> 01:04:12.040
I think we have to take
a closer look.


1026
01:04:12.073 --> 01:04:14.709
It's too bad all the women
he interacts with
