00:00:40.935 --> 00:00:44.893
The number you
dialed is out of range


2
00:00:45.226 --> 00:00:46.476
Try again later

3
00:00:46.726 --> 00:00:51.726
The number you
dialed is out of range


4
00:00:51.726 --> 00:00:54.393
Try again later

5
00:00:56.726 --> 00:00:58.643
My brother has been
missing since last night


6
00:00:58.726 --> 00:01:01.018
He had never been this long before

7
00:01:02.351 --> 00:01:07.310
According to the forest department,
the tiger population is increasing


8
00:01:07.851 --> 00:01:09.976
That's right, it's not been a month yet

9
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.018
Tiger kills Village
Head of Vadda Nagar


10
00:01:14.101 --> 00:01:15.935
I saw his lifeless
body with my own eyes


11
00:01:17.351 --> 00:01:19.560
The blood vessels are like noodles.
Disgusting!


12
00:01:19.768 --> 00:01:20.935
Oh Lord

13
00:01:28.185 --> 00:01:31.060
My brother went to Italy and
came back wearing glasses


14
00:01:31.685 --> 00:01:32.935
Why are you crying?

15
00:01:33.601 --> 00:01:34.976
I feel worried

16
00:01:37.476 --> 00:01:39.726
Let me cherish my brother's memory

17
00:01:41.976 --> 00:01:45.560
Now you will drink from
the Mouser Brar bottle


18
00:01:48.726 --> 00:01:53.226
- Brother is still alive
- Yes


19
00:02:18.185 --> 00:02:19.560
He's coming

20
00:02:35.143 --> 00:02:36.226
This

21
00:02:37.601 --> 00:02:39.185
These are your glasses from Italy

22
00:02:50.685 --> 00:02:52.560
Brother, you killed
that pig very cruelly


23
00:02:56.101 --> 00:02:57.393
I slaughtered him

24
00:02:59.018 --> 00:03:00.893
and the fly was happy with the blood

25
00:03:03.435 --> 00:03:05.643
- You know, Arjun?
- Yes


26
00:03:05.851 --> 00:03:08.226
My brother's target is
even more dangerous


27
00:03:09.351 --> 00:03:11.351
Arjun aimed at the fish's eyes

28
00:03:12.476 --> 00:03:14.518
Imagine if I targeted
flies in the same way


29
00:03:46.476 --> 00:03:47.351
No, brother

30
00:03:48.685 --> 00:03:49.560
Please, brother

31
00:04:05.226 --> 00:04:06.685
You live with Mouser,

32
00:04:07.601 --> 00:04:08.768
but you're afraid of bullets?

33
00:05:28.893 --> 00:05:30.018
Place the bag like this

34
00:05:30.101 --> 00:05:31.185
Aim in this direction

35
00:05:31.393 --> 00:05:33.268
The weapon should be
visible when I take it out


36
00:05:33.351 --> 00:05:35.143
Come on brother, start shooting

37
00:05:38.143 --> 00:05:39.310
How are you all?

38
00:05:39.601 --> 00:05:42.143
I have a request for all of you

39
00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:44.810
Asle Wale Sardar does
not support any violence


40
00:05:44.935 --> 00:05:48.060
Children under the age of

41
00:05:48.185 --> 00:05:52.143
There are many other things available
on the internet for your entertainment


42
00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:54.893
Now we will start the video
for viewers aged 18 and over


43
00:05:57.935 --> 00:06:00.643
This is a panther from
the Second World War


44
00:06:01.018 --> 00:06:02.351
9mm loger

45
00:06:03.018 --> 00:06:06.143
During the Second World War, Hitler's
army used this weapon as their weapon


46
00:06:06.226 --> 00:06:09.018
The cartridge is slightly
larger than 32 bore


47
00:06:09.685 --> 00:06:10.851
This is rare

48
00:06:15.018 --> 00:06:18.101
This is the main firearm of
today's video, Bulbul's son


49
00:06:18.685 --> 00:06:19.976
Brigitte Tom Cat

50
00:06:20.185 --> 00:06:24.143
And as before, the boxes are
sponsored by Hem Raaj Halwaai & Sons


51
00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:25.726
And I ask

52
00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:28.518
Please give us a like
and share our video


53
00:06:28.685 --> 00:06:31.185
Now, let's assess the aiming
accuracy of each firearm


54
00:07:57.393 --> 00:08:00.726
The bullet is round

55
00:08:02.226 --> 00:08:04.518
Like tropical almonds

56
00:08:04.685 --> 00:08:07.018
In Arabic, almonds
are called 'Fandook'


57
00:08:07.143 --> 00:08:09.851
And the weapon
used to shoot him,


58
00:08:10.101 --> 00:08:11.518
called 'Bandook'

59
00:08:11.893 --> 00:08:17.893
In Punjabi, the old name
of 'Bandook' is 'Tufang'


60
00:08:18.393 --> 00:08:21.643
The word 'Tufang'
comes from Farsi


61
00:08:22.976 --> 00:08:28.226
Likewise in Türkiye it is called 'Tufek'

62
00:08:31.935 --> 00:08:33.810
In Punjabi, the name is 'Tupak'

63
00:08:33.935 --> 00:08:34.893
I go

64
00:08:36.935 --> 00:08:40.601
Guns are an integral part
of our religion and history


65
00:08:41.268 --> 00:08:44.185
Each weapon has its
own historical meaning


66
00:08:44.893 --> 00:08:50.018
World history is
incomplete without weapons


67
00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:54.935
The use of weapons must
be solely for self-defense


68
00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:57.976
Weapons are amazing

69
00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:01.226
Guru Sahibaan
called him our saint


70
00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:03.810
In Shri Guru Granth Sahib,

71
00:09:04.268 --> 00:09:08.685
the term 'Tupak' is used instead
of 'Bandook' to describe the weapon


72
00:09:09.685 --> 00:09:14.185
In the Dasam Granth, these
words are mentioned many times


73
00:09:14.476 --> 00:09:16.393
'Tupak' and 'Tufang'

74
00:10:02.518 --> 00:10:05.060
I heard that in
the last few days


75
00:10:06.101 --> 00:10:09.185
the government has revoked the
permits of more than 1000 firearms


76
00:10:10.143 --> 00:10:13.643
In America, you can legally
obtain a firearm without a permit


77
00:10:13.726 --> 00:10:14.976
You can even get 47

78
00:10:15.976 --> 00:10:16.810
No, my friend

79
00:10:17.935 --> 00:10:20.476
Having a firearms license is required

80
00:10:20.601 --> 00:10:22.976
And it must be given to
the people of the country


81
00:10:23.101 --> 00:10:27.435
But here, we need it to open fire at a
wedding party and bring down the tent


82
00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:28.560
That's right

83
00:10:28.643 --> 00:10:30.185
Hello, sir

84
00:10:30.435 --> 00:10:31.768
Regards!

85
00:10:31.851 --> 00:10:32.851
Welcome, Jeen Singh

86
00:10:33.268 --> 00:10:35.310
Here, Uncle.  I've fixed it

87
00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:38.393
- I fixed it, and now it's good
- Good


88
00:10:41.226 --> 00:10:42.643
You've made it look like new

89
00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:46.851
Jeen Singh, what happened?

90
00:10:47.476 --> 00:10:50.226
I heard that the government
confiscated your firearms recently


91
00:10:50.268 --> 00:10:51.560
It was a tragedy

92
00:10:51.685 --> 00:10:53.930
At my nephew's wedding,
my wife mistakenly


93
00:10:53.942 --> 00:10:55.726
drank alcohol
thinking it was tea


94
00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:59.518
Then he fired two shots,
and someone filed a complaint


95
00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:03.310
Uncle, I advise you to keep
two things away from your wife,


96
00:11:03.851 --> 00:11:06.601
the first is a car steering wheel,
and the second is a firearm


97
00:11:07.101 --> 00:11:08.893
It may cause an
accident at any time


98
00:11:09.601 --> 00:11:10.435
No, my son

99
00:11:11.393 --> 00:11:13.518
There is no difference
between men and women


100
00:11:13.685 --> 00:11:16.101
It's just about how it's handled

101
00:11:17.351 --> 00:11:18.851
Who will teach them
how to handle it?


102
00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:29.851
You aimed correctly, but
you couldn't hit the target


103
00:11:31.935 --> 00:11:34.143
Look at him, he
shoots very skillfully


104
00:11:34.185 --> 00:11:35.476
Nightingale Child

105
00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:37.351
Brigitte Tom Cat

106
00:11:38.601 --> 00:11:40.060
He has a real gun

107
00:11:40.893 --> 00:11:42.810
There is a difference
between real and fake


108
00:11:54.393 --> 00:11:55.560
Buy real firearms

109
00:11:55.768 --> 00:11:58.018
'Very rare, made
by Mouser company'


110
00:11:58.018 --> 00:11:58.935
This is rare

111
00:12:03.185 --> 00:12:06.351
Dad, I'm thinking

112
00:12:08.018 --> 00:12:09.935
how about buying a gun?

113
00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:13.435
It's like we have buried
treasure in our house


114
00:12:14.435 --> 00:12:16.893
I bought a gun when there
was a dispute with Chhinda


115
00:12:17.768 --> 00:12:21.393
It has been many years since
the dispute with China ended


116
00:12:21.893 --> 00:12:22.893
Then I sold it

117
00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:24.435
There was never a need

118
00:12:24.685 --> 00:12:25.893
Why do you need a gun?

119
00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:27.935
Do you want to be a criminal?

120
00:12:28.685 --> 00:12:30.143
It's not about being a villain

121
00:12:30.893 --> 00:12:32.476
Our house is located
in the middle of a field


122
00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:34.726
What if one day there are robbers?

123
00:12:35.351 --> 00:12:37.310
How will we defend ourselves?
With cow dung?


124
00:12:38.143 --> 00:12:39.476
Having a gun is important

125
00:12:39.643 --> 00:12:42.476
Do what you need to
do.  Stop this nonsense


126
00:12:42.935 --> 00:12:45.476
Marry.  Your little
sister has a child now


127
00:12:46.143 --> 00:12:47.435
And you're still not married

128
00:12:47.768 --> 00:12:50.268
Now you bring up
something new, wanting a gun


129
00:12:50.393 --> 00:12:52.393
I'm just talking about
normal things, ma'am


130
00:12:52.476 --> 00:12:54.101
And you start criticizing me

131
00:12:54.268 --> 00:12:56.060
Don't force me to hit you

132
00:12:56.935 --> 00:12:58.393
He wants a gun

133
00:13:01.601 --> 00:13:03.685
Band 9, IELTS Institute

134
00:13:04.685 --> 00:13:07.768
The government is strict
about weapons licensing


135
00:13:08.393 --> 00:13:11.435
The government gives permits to
those whose lives are threatened


136
00:13:11.518 --> 00:13:14.018
Or to a particular officer,
but what do you have?


137
00:13:14.726 --> 00:13:16.226
IELTS center only

138
00:13:16.351 --> 00:13:17.976
Will someone steal the band from you?

139
00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:22.435
Madam, we need
permission for our safety


140
00:13:23.185 --> 00:13:27.310
You know that there are 80-90
rape cases filed in India every day


141
00:13:27.393 --> 00:13:28.893
And some cases are not even reported

142
00:13:28.976 --> 00:13:31.185
The government is not
taking action for our safety


143
00:13:31.268 --> 00:13:34.060
We have the right to own
guns for our protection


144
00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:36.851
Well, weapons for girls

145
00:13:37.351 --> 00:13:38.976
AK47 is filled with red chili powder

146
00:13:39.226 --> 00:13:40.560
Even I use this

147
00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:42.268
Why kill men?

148
00:13:42.476 --> 00:13:43.893
Just blind their eyes

149
00:13:44.185 --> 00:13:46.643
Madam, arrange a
meeting with DC for us


150
00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:49.476
How about arranging a
meeting with the Prime Minister?


151
00:13:49.685 --> 00:13:51.976
Get out of here.
Looking for weapons


152
00:13:52.101 --> 00:13:54.060
Even the Punjab Police
do not have weapons


153
00:13:54.726 --> 00:13:55.643
Get out of here

154
00:14:00.393 --> 00:14:03.435
This is a buskat weapon

155
00:14:04.476 --> 00:14:05.851
The King of Patiala had this

156
00:14:07.768 --> 00:14:09.268
Then Raja Manish had it

157
00:14:09.810 --> 00:14:12.143
Then it was at the
Britisher's Museum


158
00:14:12.726 --> 00:14:15.935
Now it has arrived at
its rightful place, with you


159
00:14:16.476 --> 00:14:17.310
This

160
00:14:32.935 --> 00:14:34.226
- How beautiful!
- Yes


161
00:14:34.643 --> 00:14:36.685
There is a new sparrow in the forest

162
00:14:37.393 --> 00:14:38.726
Let's go and check it out

163
00:14:39.685 --> 00:14:40.768
Liar

164
00:14:42.101 --> 00:14:44.435
That's not a lie.  Come with me

165
00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:48.393
Brother, Uncle took Babbu
with him to see the sparrows


166
00:14:50.601 --> 00:14:51.768
Feel free to join too

167
00:14:52.518 --> 00:14:53.768
And look what Uncle did

168
00:14:55.018 --> 00:14:56.351
Observe how he pees

169
00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:11.643
Regards!

170
00:15:16.476 --> 00:15:17.560
Don't worry

171
00:15:19.018 --> 00:15:19.976
Regards!

172
00:15:21.143 --> 00:15:22.643
Regards!

173
00:15:23.601 --> 00:15:26.185
No need for that, sister

174
00:15:26.518 --> 00:15:30.101
It was a blessing for his
daughter on such an occasion


175
00:15:31.268 --> 00:15:33.101
OK, your daughter is upstairs

176
00:15:33.726 --> 00:15:36.143
And your son-in-law is
checking weapons outside


177
00:15:36.601 --> 00:15:37.435
Okay

178
00:15:42.935 --> 00:15:45.935
Go and meet your brother-in-law

179
00:15:46.226 --> 00:15:47.518
I'll see him later

180
00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:49.268
Go and meet him

181
00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:51.101
OK, I'll go

182
00:15:59.935 --> 00:16:00.810
Okay

183
00:16:04.601 --> 00:16:05.810
How are you, uncle?

184
00:16:06.601 --> 00:16:07.893
I'm fine

185
00:16:08.268 --> 00:16:09.560
How are you, brother-in-law?

186
00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:12.268
How is your weapons business?

187
00:16:14.601 --> 00:16:16.351
Is the business progressing or stalling?

188
00:16:17.101 --> 00:16:18.768
Don't worry, I'll take care of it

189
00:16:20.643 --> 00:16:23.643
It is said that dark
clouds can cover the sun


190
00:16:24.643 --> 00:16:26.101
but can't stop getting up

191
00:16:27.643 --> 00:16:29.226
Whose status is this?

192
00:16:32.976 --> 00:16:35.185
Running an armory
business requires leadership


193
00:16:37.601 --> 00:16:40.143
Your leadership qualities ended
with the death of your father


194
00:16:41.268 --> 00:16:44.101
Let me suggest you
to start a Chaamp kiosk


195
00:16:44.726 --> 00:16:46.518
You can earn four to
five thousand every day


196
00:16:46.685 --> 00:16:47.726
Here's what you can do,

197
00:16:48.768 --> 00:16:50.643
find yourself a
beautiful wife, and


198
00:16:50.685 --> 00:16:52.268
you can earn 15
thousand every day


199
00:16:53.143 --> 00:16:55.185
Sell ​​Chaamp and make videos online

200
00:16:55.268 --> 00:16:59.268
Chaamp and online videos,
this is a great opportunity for you


201
00:17:00.685 --> 00:17:01.893
Are you interested in this?

202
00:17:02.768 --> 00:17:03.768
This is very rare

203
00:17:04.476 --> 00:17:05.310
Seldom?

204
00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:11.268
Nothing is rarer than this

205
00:17:17.643 --> 00:17:19.351
Can I put him in his place?

206
00:17:21.726 --> 00:17:22.976
He's my brother-in-law

207
00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:25.768
I don't know if I would
call him brother-in-law


208
00:17:26.185 --> 00:17:27.768
or wretched bastard

209
00:17:28.685 --> 00:17:31.476
or I'll cut it into pieces
and love it to the dogs


210
00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:35.226
Only I have the power
to do this, no one else


211
00:17:35.893 --> 00:17:36.726
Understand?

212
00:17:37.101 --> 00:17:37.976
Yes

213
00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:49.018
Unfortunately, disputes between
husband and wife are commonplace


214
00:17:50.268 --> 00:17:52.476
It's better if they
stay in a relationship


215
00:17:52.768 --> 00:17:56.393
A husband is like an
animal in front of his wife


216
00:17:57.560 --> 00:18:00.601
You never know when he
will scold you or show love


217
00:18:02.685 --> 00:18:04.685
A wife can save her home

218
00:18:05.601 --> 00:18:07.976
by closing his eyes like a bird

219
00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:12.476
Even after my marriage, I
kept my eyes closed, Mom


220
00:18:14.976 --> 00:18:16.101
Mom

221
00:18:20.393 --> 00:18:21.560
The turban suits you

222
00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:24.476
I told him to wear it every day

223
00:18:25.018 --> 00:18:26.226
But he didn't listen to me

224
00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:28.976
Even his Australian girlfriend
was impressed with his turban


225
00:18:29.768 --> 00:18:32.476
She's a mother now.
Please, stop mentioning him


226
00:18:32.643 --> 00:18:34.101
Get married

227
00:18:35.393 --> 00:18:38.768
Please, both of you, stop
thinking about my marriage


228
00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:40.810
I don't want to get married

229
00:18:41.476 --> 00:18:42.976
OK, don't be angry

230
00:18:43.143 --> 00:18:44.643
Please sit.  I'll get some food

231
00:18:44.893 --> 00:18:46.060
No, no need

232
00:18:47.976 --> 00:18:50.351
You don't like eating the food here

233
00:18:51.726 --> 00:18:52.643
Okay, no problem

234
00:18:53.101 --> 00:18:55.435
I'll come home next
week and bring you Saag


235
00:18:56.018 --> 00:18:58.143
No, that's not necessary

236
00:18:59.018 --> 00:19:00.143
Grandpa was alone in the shop

237
00:19:05.810 --> 00:19:07.435
- Greetings, Uncle!
- Greetings, Uncle!


238
00:19:07.476 --> 00:19:08.310
Regards!

239
00:19:09.768 --> 00:19:11.726
Jewelry shop is in Vadda Bazar

240
00:19:12.101 --> 00:19:15.351
And you can find sparkling
jewelry at Kila wala chownk


241
00:19:16.018 --> 00:19:18.101
Uncle, we are here to buy a gun

242
00:19:19.018 --> 00:19:19.851
Gun?

243
00:19:20.143 --> 00:19:21.310
Why do you need a gun?

244
00:19:21.476 --> 00:19:22.810
Because of family disputes

245
00:19:23.143 --> 00:19:24.643
- We are sisters
- Yes


246
00:19:24.685 --> 00:19:25.976
We don't have any brothers

247
00:19:26.226 --> 00:19:28.143
The family wants to take over our land

248
00:19:28.226 --> 00:19:30.435
- Because we are women
- These are the dark ages


249
00:19:32.143 --> 00:19:34.726
However, you are strong
girls.  Show your license


250
00:19:35.976 --> 00:19:38.476
We don't have one,
but my dad has a license


251
00:19:39.018 --> 00:19:40.851
Today we came here
to look at the gun

252
00:19:42.893 --> 00:19:46.810
Gun House does not display
handguns without a license


253
00:19:47.393 --> 00:19:50.185
You're girls, so I'll show you

254
00:19:50.268 --> 00:19:52.435
- All right
- Show us the 32 bore


255
00:19:52.893 --> 00:19:55.185
Looks like you
came here prepared


256
00:19:57.768 --> 00:19:58.643
Let me take it

257
00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:19.185
Uncle, who is in the photo?

258
00:20:23.351 --> 00:20:25.643
He's my grandson, and that's me

259
00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:28.018
He is my son

260
00:20:29.226 --> 00:20:30.768
He is no longer with us

261
00:20:30.893 --> 00:20:31.810
Very sad to hear that

262
00:20:33.018 --> 00:20:35.185
OK uncle, we will come tomorrow

263
00:20:35.435 --> 00:20:36.726
with Dad and his license

264
00:20:37.726 --> 00:20:38.601
Regards!

265
00:20:38.685 --> 00:20:39.518
Regards!

266
00:20:42.143 --> 00:20:43.810
- Move fast
- Come on


267
00:20:43.976 --> 00:20:45.851
But his car was parked on that side

268
00:20:53.476 --> 00:20:54.518
Two girls

269
00:20:54.768 --> 00:20:56.351
wearing a red and black suit

270
00:20:56.351 --> 00:20:59.935
Like black magic, and
they definitely use it


271
00:21:00.935 --> 00:21:03.393
Uncle agrees to show the gun

272
00:21:04.726 --> 00:21:07.601
Uncle, both of them have
the intention of deceiving you


273
00:21:08.893 --> 00:21:12.726
Uncle starts telling
his family story here


274
00:21:13.101 --> 00:21:14.393
And they do their work here

275
00:21:14.476 --> 00:21:16.018
He put the gun in the bag

276
00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:22.143
Arjan, these girls are fooling uncle

277
00:21:22.226 --> 00:21:25.851
Oh my gosh, I'm going
to lower the quality to 3gp


278
00:21:25.851 --> 00:21:27.226
Have common sense when speaking

279
00:21:30.226 --> 00:21:32.435
Forgive me, venerable uncle

280
00:21:33.351 --> 00:21:34.060
Forgive me

281
00:21:34.185 --> 00:21:35.268
There is one thing to consider

282
00:21:35.351 --> 00:21:38.351
We don't even give samosas to
anyone without taking payment


283
00:21:39.185 --> 00:21:41.310
and why did uncle show
them a gun without permission?


284
00:21:41.393 --> 00:21:42.810
Geez,

285
00:21:43.101 --> 00:21:46.101
go to your shop and check
the sugar syrup for jalebi


286
00:21:46.643 --> 00:21:48.101
No need to be Power from CID

287
00:21:48.768 --> 00:21:50.851
I have a new camera
with HD quality


288
00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:54.185
with a 29.5% discount.
Do you want to?


289
00:21:54.476 --> 00:21:57.601
Stop your CCTV business
and start selling kohl by the bus


290
00:21:58.393 --> 00:22:01.268
You start selling your product
without assessing the situation


291
00:22:03.018 --> 00:22:04.560
We have CCTV footage, uncle

292
00:22:05.268 --> 00:22:06.893
Uncle Sama will come
at the police station


293
00:22:06.976 --> 00:22:08.685
Let's call him and file a complaint

294
00:22:11.351 --> 00:22:14.393
I received a call from Mr Randhawa,
so it was natural for me to come


295
00:22:15.601 --> 00:22:18.643
I used to tell about
you at the police station


296
00:22:19.851 --> 00:22:20.726
Which story?

297
00:22:21.185 --> 00:22:25.185
One day, someone stole his horse

298
00:22:26.435 --> 00:22:28.060
Do you know what he did?

299
00:22:29.726 --> 00:22:31.185
He didn't chase the thief

300
00:22:32.143 --> 00:22:36.518
By hearing the clatter of
horse hooves from 2 km away,


301
00:22:37.143 --> 00:22:38.893
he aimed his gun at the target

302
00:22:39.393 --> 00:22:42.268
And the shot directly hit
the thief in the buttocks


303
00:22:44.018 --> 00:22:46.226
And since that day

304
00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:49.310
Nobody dares to steal
anything from your place


305
00:22:50.185 --> 00:22:52.851
Mr. Randhawa was a
great shooter from the start


306
00:22:53.226 --> 00:22:54.768
And regarding courage,

307
00:22:55.101 --> 00:22:57.935
Courage is in your blood, my son

308
00:23:00.851 --> 00:23:03.976
I forgot to ask why you
called me here, Mr. Randhawa


309
00:23:05.601 --> 00:23:06.601
Tell him, Arjan

310
00:23:08.476 --> 00:23:10.518
We sold several pistols
in the last few days


311
00:23:10.601 --> 00:23:12.476
So I thought I'd give
you some information


312
00:23:13.601 --> 00:23:15.518
and drink tea with you

313
00:23:16.143 --> 00:23:18.226
OK, that's good

314
00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:21.560
Give me the register and
order another tea, it's delicious


315
00:23:27.851 --> 00:23:30.643
Our Gun House was in
Rawal Pind before partition


316
00:23:32.643 --> 00:23:37.226
In those days, my
father kept the shop open


317
00:23:37.643 --> 00:23:39.601
and will be out on various assignments

318
00:23:41.851 --> 00:23:47.101
In those days, there
were lots of robbers


319
00:23:47.976 --> 00:23:51.476
My father is very famous
throughout the region


320
00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:55.185
so no one dares

321
00:23:55.768 --> 00:23:59.601
entered the shop in his absence

322
00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:04.060
Today, look at me

323
00:24:05.268 --> 00:24:07.560
Why are you depressed?

324
00:24:10.185 --> 00:24:11.101
Yes, Arjan

325
00:24:13.310 --> 00:24:15.143
I'm getting weak now

326
00:24:17.101 --> 00:24:20.310
We continue this business without reason

327
00:24:21.726 --> 00:24:25.560
We have to shut down this Gun House

328
00:24:27.310 --> 00:24:30.185
Gun House is not just
a business, but a legacy


329
00:24:30.976 --> 00:24:32.560
And the legacy never closes

330
00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:34.685
Eat your food

331
00:24:35.351 --> 00:24:38.226
I'll look for the gun and
track down the robber too


332
00:24:57.893 --> 00:24:59.935
Is this your first time coming here?

333
00:25:02.018 --> 00:25:03.101
You can go

334
00:26:22.351 --> 00:26:24.268
This is CCTV footage
from Mattu's shop


335
00:26:29.143 --> 00:26:29.976
Take a look

336
00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:31.851
Here they approached Dharamshala

337
00:26:32.976 --> 00:26:33.893
They turned

338
00:26:35.518 --> 00:26:38.768
Now they are near my
beloved Kajal's beauty salon


339
00:26:38.976 --> 00:26:40.726
Since when did Kajal
become your girlfriend?


340
00:26:41.851 --> 00:26:44.726
Since I sold him a 20
thousand camera for 5 thousand


341
00:26:45.768 --> 00:26:47.476
It's been a long time

342
00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:50.351
When girls used to be
impressed by sweet things


343
00:26:50.935 --> 00:26:52.476
Now we have to
spend a lot of money

344
00:26:53.143 --> 00:26:54.726
You're going to break my camera

345
00:26:54.935 --> 00:26:56.101
Birju, where is the camera?

346
00:26:56.768 --> 00:26:58.143
It's on the muzzle

347
00:26:59.185 --> 00:27:01.685
I have a camera disguised
as a pen and even a nose ring


348
00:27:02.226 --> 00:27:03.768
I have cameras of various sizes

349
00:27:04.351 --> 00:27:05.226
Let me see

350
00:27:08.018 --> 00:27:09.393
This is what we call Sticky Camera

351
00:27:09.601 --> 00:27:11.810
Used in hotels so
videos can be leaked


352
00:27:12.935 --> 00:27:14.893
You can even put it
in your girlfriend's room


353
00:27:14.976 --> 00:27:17.768
You can monitor
who visits his house


354
00:27:18.018 --> 00:27:19.435
Put it up at your girl's house

355
00:27:19.643 --> 00:27:21.726
So you can track
who visits his house


356
00:27:21.810 --> 00:27:22.726
Pause the video

357
00:27:24.768 --> 00:27:25.810
Play back

358
00:27:28.143 --> 00:27:30.310
- Zoom in on the car mirror
- OK


359
00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:31.893
Zoom in again

360
00:27:33.143 --> 00:27:34.268
B9

361
00:27:35.226 --> 00:27:36.810
BAND 9

362
00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:51.435
They're there

363
00:27:57.560 --> 00:27:58.393
Start the jeep

364
00:27:59.851 --> 00:28:00.726
Let's go

365
00:28:18.018 --> 00:28:19.435
Wait a minute, stop the car

366
00:28:21.351 --> 00:28:23.726
I think the kids in the
jeep are following us


367
00:28:25.518 --> 00:28:28.310
I know they've been following
us since we left the Institute


368
00:28:29.101 --> 00:28:30.393
He is the owner of the Gun House

369
00:28:31.226 --> 00:28:32.143
Get out of the car

370
00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:33.018
Okay

371
00:28:38.268 --> 00:28:41.018
What is the problem?
Why are you following us?


372
00:28:41.435 --> 00:28:42.476
What is going on?

373
00:28:44.435 --> 00:28:46.018
I think they are our lovers

374
00:28:48.435 --> 00:28:50.268
If I upload your
video on social media


375
00:28:50.476 --> 00:28:52.143
This madness of love will diminish

376
00:28:53.268 --> 00:28:55.310
If I want love, Chandigarh
is the place I choose


377
00:28:55.393 --> 00:28:57.268
We don't waste
time on girls like you


378
00:28:57.768 --> 00:28:58.768
Give me back my gun

379
00:28:59.435 --> 00:29:00.310
Gun?

380
00:29:01.268 --> 00:29:02.310
What you stole

381
00:29:04.768 --> 00:29:06.643
If you are facing financial difficulties

382
00:29:07.226 --> 00:29:09.435
and need help with
your wedding, let us know


383
00:29:09.518 --> 00:29:10.393
We will help you

384
00:29:11.726 --> 00:29:13.018
I'll sponsor the catering

385
00:29:13.268 --> 00:29:16.393
Our sweets are famous
in this city, right, Birju?


386
00:29:16.393 --> 00:29:18.351
- Do we look like thieves?
- Yes


387
00:29:19.143 --> 00:29:20.435
Do you know who I am?

388
00:29:21.101 --> 00:29:24.351
She was the daughter of a respectable
family.  He owned hectares of land


389
00:29:24.768 --> 00:29:26.435
Why did you mention it to me?

390
00:29:29.268 --> 00:29:30.351
Give me back my gun

391
00:29:32.643 --> 00:29:33.893
Wait a moment

392
00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:37.726
You mentioned the village
where Bahadur was the leader


393
00:29:37.976 --> 00:29:39.560
Yes, why?
Are they your brothers?


394
00:29:39.643 --> 00:29:43.268
No, it's not like that.  He once
beat me for trying to seduce a girl


395
00:29:43.351 --> 00:29:44.601
I just want to make sure

396
00:29:46.101 --> 00:29:47.810
You can continue

397
00:29:47.935 --> 00:29:49.810
You're so stupid

398
00:29:49.976 --> 00:29:51.435
No need to show attitude

399
00:29:52.393 --> 00:29:53.643
Give me back my gun

400
00:29:53.685 --> 00:29:56.393
- I have CCTV footage of
you stealing the gun - Really?


401
00:29:57.268 --> 00:29:59.685
Go to the police
station and show them


402
00:30:01.268 --> 00:30:04.435
You talk like a gangster but
don't even know how to hold a gun


403
00:30:06.018 --> 00:30:06.851
Come on, Rani

404
00:30:09.518 --> 00:30:10.560
Now watch my movements

405
00:30:13.685 --> 00:30:15.851
- This - What if he really
files a complaint against us?


406
00:30:15.935 --> 00:30:18.018
If he wanted to, he
would have done it


407
00:30:18.143 --> 00:30:19.601
He won't be here following us

408
00:30:19.726 --> 00:30:21.101
Now, watch the live broadcast

409
00:30:59.018 --> 00:31:01.643
I'm sure he keeps
his gun in this room


410
00:31:03.726 --> 00:31:06.351
My friend, if someone finds you

411
00:31:06.810 --> 00:31:08.851
please don't mention me.
I'm not with you


412
00:31:09.643 --> 00:31:11.476
Why?  I'm here with you

413
00:31:12.101 --> 00:31:15.685
Whenever you are in trouble, call
Ashu Jatt Jinder, and I will come


414
00:31:15.893 --> 00:31:18.935
- Shout loudly
- My friend, don't joke


415
00:31:19.518 --> 00:31:21.851
They will beat you
like a soft rasgulla


416
00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:25.393
I'm not like you, who accepts
defeat before competing


417
00:31:25.476 --> 00:31:27.018
Shut up

418
00:31:27.143 --> 00:31:29.935
- You - There are lots of mosquitoes
here, don't catch dengue fever


419
00:31:30.601 --> 00:31:31.560
I go now

420
00:31:34.851 --> 00:31:36.226
He would definitely be beaten

421
00:33:14.143 --> 00:33:15.643
Guns are like lovers

422
00:33:16.351 --> 00:33:17.893
We hold it with love

423
00:33:19.101 --> 00:33:20.810
Not hidden in a box like you

424
00:33:21.226 --> 00:33:22.310
When I scream

425
00:33:23.393 --> 00:33:25.476
the residents will hit you hard

426
00:33:26.685 --> 00:33:28.143
If I hit you with this

427
00:33:28.685 --> 00:33:30.226
you will see stars

428
00:33:31.268 --> 00:33:32.101
Hit me

429
00:33:32.893 --> 00:33:33.726
Shout

430
00:33:34.268 --> 00:33:35.143
You hit me

431
00:33:36.226 --> 00:33:38.893
You planned it like a Money Heist

432
00:33:40.143 --> 00:33:42.518
But you forgot to
take off your car sticker


433
00:33:46.185 --> 00:33:49.726
We know how to
handle and use firearms


434
00:34:29.518 --> 00:34:31.060
We got the gun

435
00:34:31.601 --> 00:34:33.226
but one bullet is missing

436
00:34:33.810 --> 00:34:35.643
It's a shame the bullet came here

437
00:34:36.643 --> 00:34:38.435
What if he had a
grenade in his pocket?


438
00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:39.768
Be careful, my friend

439
00:34:43.810 --> 00:34:44.976
Who opened the door?

440
00:34:45.435 --> 00:34:46.393
Who's that?

441
00:34:46.893 --> 00:34:49.185
There is a scythe placed
where you are standing


442
00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:50.893
And I broke down
the gate with it


443
00:34:51.101 --> 00:34:53.518
I want to let you know
that I use cartoons


444
00:34:59.476 --> 00:35:00.435
Who's that?

445
00:35:00.935 --> 00:35:01.768
A man

446
00:35:03.143 --> 00:35:04.435
He must have been saved

447
00:35:07.185 --> 00:35:08.601
How much does the gun cost?

448
00:35:09.810 --> 00:35:10.768
The price is 2.5 lakhs

449
00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:13.685
I have 2 lakh now, later I
will give you 50 thousand


450
00:35:15.060 --> 00:35:16.060
Do you have a license?

451
00:35:16.351 --> 00:35:17.185
Yes, I have

452
00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:18.685
Is that your father's license?

453
00:35:19.060 --> 00:35:19.893
Yes

454
00:35:21.226 --> 00:35:24.143
First, tell me why
you need a firearm?


455
00:35:25.101 --> 00:35:26.893
You have various types of firearms

456
00:35:27.476 --> 00:35:28.518
You upload a video

457
00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:31.435
in this world, only you
have a hobby like that, right?


458
00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:33.518
He has created a training
ground for himself on the bike


459
00:35:33.601 --> 00:35:34.810
He trains there every day

460
00:35:34.893 --> 00:35:37.226
We saw traces of nail
polish in the bowl there


461
00:35:38.935 --> 00:35:41.976
True firearms lovers are also like him

462
00:35:44.768 --> 00:35:46.393
Do you know who the real lover is?

463
00:35:47.226 --> 00:35:50.435
Those who steal firearms
only because of interest


464
00:35:52.643 --> 00:35:54.185
Bring your father's license tomorrow

465
00:35:54.893 --> 00:35:57.476
Give 2 lakh now and 50 thousand later

466
00:35:57.893 --> 00:36:01.768
Tell me, how do you
aim so accurately?


467
00:36:04.768 --> 00:36:07.351
To do that, you must
make your lover a firearm


468
00:36:07.768 --> 00:36:09.726
and love them like explosives

469
00:36:11.393 --> 00:36:12.393
Will you teach me?

470
00:36:15.351 --> 00:36:16.643
Will you love?

471
00:36:24.810 --> 00:36:28.060
What do you think,
my friend, will he love?


472
00:36:28.643 --> 00:36:29.851
I can't say for sure

473
00:36:30.601 --> 00:36:32.310
But he will knock you out

474
00:36:32.685 --> 00:36:35.685
I realize that you, Jatt, are
not very good at business


475
00:37:40.435 --> 00:37:43.976
To achieve the target, you
need to regulate your breathing


476
00:37:55.768 --> 00:37:57.518
Now your breathing is out of control

477
00:40:40.685 --> 00:40:42.476
I have a proposal for you

478
00:40:43.018 --> 00:40:44.768
He has a government job in Bathinda

479
00:40:45.226 --> 00:40:46.964
How do these government
employees respond


480
00:40:46.976 --> 00:40:48.560
to the anger of
firearms enthusiasts?


481
00:40:50.143 --> 00:40:51.726
I already have
feelings for someone


482
00:40:53.185 --> 00:40:54.018
Who's he?

483
00:40:54.185 --> 00:40:55.393
He runs an IELTS center

484
00:40:56.018 --> 00:40:58.310
But he's a little different

485
00:40:59.143 --> 00:41:00.143
Different in what way?

486
00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:02.851
This means he is not someone
who follows you everywhere


487
00:41:03.685 --> 00:41:05.393
He is someone who
can make you try


488
00:41:07.393 --> 00:41:09.143
Such girls are good
at housekeeping


489
00:41:09.268 --> 00:41:11.101
He will be able to handle you

490
00:41:12.726 --> 00:41:15.226
Tell me the village, and
I'll send you an application


491
00:41:21.268 --> 00:41:22.351
He sent an application

492
00:41:24.226 --> 00:41:26.018
You won't find a
better man than him


493
00:41:27.310 --> 00:41:31.226
He must have spent over a lakh
on cartoons to teach you to shoot


494
00:41:32.893 --> 00:41:35.018
Just say yes.
What do you think?


495
00:41:36.685 --> 00:41:37.726
Is he going to kill someone?

496
00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:41.643
You can ask him

497
00:41:59.143 --> 00:42:00.726
He didn't even get 300 views

498
00:42:01.226 --> 00:42:03.226
and he acts like he
has 3 million views


499
00:42:04.768 --> 00:42:05.935
But he's cute

500
00:42:07.351 --> 00:42:08.726
Even Uncle is cute

501
00:42:09.476 --> 00:42:11.435
Only his face
looks like a slipper


502
00:42:11.643 --> 00:42:14.976
When a slipper hits your
body, then you will know


503
00:42:15.101 --> 00:42:16.810
Whatever our audience...

504
00:42:17.976 --> 00:42:19.060
Let's make a video

505
00:42:23.393 --> 00:42:24.226
Take the phone

506
00:42:25.851 --> 00:42:27.310
I'll show you how to get views

507
00:42:28.601 --> 00:42:29.893
- Are you ready?
- Start!


508
00:42:31.143 --> 00:42:32.060
This is a Glock

509
00:42:32.976 --> 00:42:34.435
The impact can be very painful

510
00:42:35.143 --> 00:42:36.393
I remember the taste

511
00:42:37.685 --> 00:42:40.393
I used this to shoot
News Journalist Balveer


512
00:42:40.768 --> 00:42:42.851
He often talks bad about me

513
00:42:43.393 --> 00:42:47.768
I shot him in the chest with this

514
00:42:48.143 --> 00:42:49.518
Thaa.  Thaa

515
00:42:50.101 --> 00:42:51.351
That is very fun

516
00:42:53.060 --> 00:42:54.601
He begged for forgiveness

517
00:42:57.560 --> 00:43:01.851
It was a cold, foggy December

518
00:43:02.976 --> 00:43:04.851
and warm blood

519
00:43:09.768 --> 00:43:11.935
Human blood is quite delicious

520
00:43:15.726 --> 00:43:16.601
How?

521
00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:21.601
Brother, we did something wrong

522
00:43:22.768 --> 00:43:24.310
What need is there to mention that?

523
00:43:26.226 --> 00:43:26.935
Then what should we do?

524
00:43:26.976 --> 00:43:29.268
Let's make an entertaining video

525
00:43:29.851 --> 00:43:33.435
Entertainment, should I do
the 'Kacha Badam' dance here?


526
00:43:33.768 --> 00:43:34.935
Excuse me

527
00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:36.393
Get out of the way

528
00:43:39.476 --> 00:43:41.226
We have chosen a girl for Arjan

529
00:43:42.143 --> 00:43:43.601
We'll see him tomorrow

530
00:43:44.101 --> 00:43:46.643
I just wanted to ask, would
you like to come with us?


531
00:43:47.893 --> 00:43:48.726
Of course

532
00:43:49.601 --> 00:43:50.685
Yes

533
00:43:52.060 --> 00:43:53.685
There's more, my darling

534
00:44:37.226 --> 00:44:38.101
Get up

535
00:44:44.976 --> 00:44:45.976
Get up!

536
00:45:03.643 --> 00:45:04.893
How old is he?

537
00:45:10.893 --> 00:45:11.768
Two months

538
00:45:13.810 --> 00:45:14.685
Day?

539
00:45:15.935 --> 00:45:16.851
Seven

540
00:45:24.185 --> 00:45:26.851
Whether it's a man or a woman

541
00:45:28.935 --> 00:45:31.810
your brother won't meet my baby

542
00:45:33.851 --> 00:45:35.018
Not even a glance

543
00:45:36.226 --> 00:45:37.101
Understand?

544
00:45:38.643 --> 00:45:39.476
Yes

545
00:45:39.810 --> 00:45:41.143
Understand?

546
00:45:42.893 --> 00:45:43.935
Call him

547
00:45:50.685 --> 00:45:51.726
Call him!

548
00:46:03.935 --> 00:46:05.226
Hello, sister?

549
00:46:05.351 --> 00:46:07.768
Geez.  Romeo, have
you found your Juliet?


550
00:46:09.435 --> 00:46:11.726
Even Warieshah found her girl

551
00:46:14.518 --> 00:46:15.851
but he is not married

552
00:46:18.351 --> 00:46:20.268
Because he didn't have a Mauser

553
00:46:22.268 --> 00:46:23.560
Don't worry

554
00:46:24.226 --> 00:46:25.643
I won't let you become a saint

555
00:46:25.976 --> 00:46:27.726
Don't underestimate me, brother

556
00:46:28.476 --> 00:46:31.768
I'll be a villain when I want to

557
00:46:31.851 --> 00:46:33.601
That's the problem!

558
00:46:34.310 --> 00:46:36.560
Men should have the
same attitude after marriage


559
00:46:39.101 --> 00:46:40.726
It helps deal with their wives

560
00:46:44.226 --> 00:46:47.351
We will fire AK47
guns at your wedding


561
00:46:48.643 --> 00:46:50.226
Don't go to jail

562
00:46:50.601 --> 00:46:53.185
Sanjay was jailed for five
years for the AK47 case


563
00:46:54.976 --> 00:46:57.101
That's the difference
between a fake inheritance


564
00:46:57.893 --> 00:46:59.518
and royal blood

565
00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:03.143
I told you we would shoot
AK47s at your wedding


566
00:47:03.935 --> 00:47:05.435
And we will

567
00:47:07.018 --> 00:47:09.560
We will not damage your reputation

568
00:47:20.976 --> 00:47:22.893
Tomorrow wear a yellow suit

569
00:47:23.685 --> 00:47:25.018
Yellow suits you

570
00:47:25.976 --> 00:47:26.810
Okay?

571
00:47:27.893 --> 00:47:29.268
Now, show your smile

572
00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:34.393
It's not charming

573
00:47:35.226 --> 00:47:36.143
Laugh out loud

574
00:47:38.476 --> 00:47:39.726
I told you to laugh

575
00:47:42.685 --> 00:47:43.893
Not like that

576
00:47:45.101 --> 00:47:46.935
Laugh out loud so I can enjoy it

577
00:47:48.185 --> 00:47:49.685
I told you to laugh

578
00:47:51.685 --> 00:47:52.393
Laugh!

579
00:47:52.476 --> 00:47:53.851
Everyone is sleeping

580
00:47:53.976 --> 00:47:55.310
Laugh!

581
00:47:55.685 --> 00:47:57.018
I told you to laugh out loud!

582
00:47:59.685 --> 00:48:00.810
Good, harder

583
00:48:01.768 --> 00:48:03.560
Good, harder

584
00:48:03.976 --> 00:48:04.810
Laugh!

585
00:48:06.518 --> 00:48:07.768
Laugh!

586
00:48:07.768 --> 00:48:09.643
These are tears of joy

587
00:48:09.976 --> 00:48:11.435
Laugh!

588
00:48:20.435 --> 00:48:21.685
What happened to your hand?

589
00:48:23.893 --> 00:48:24.851
That girl is beautiful

590
00:48:25.268 --> 00:48:26.810
I think he's a
perfect match for you


591
00:48:29.726 --> 00:48:31.143
- Brother
- Yes


592
00:48:31.601 --> 00:48:33.018
My daughter is really settled

593
00:48:35.268 --> 00:48:36.685
Yes you're right

594
00:48:39.143 --> 00:48:41.060
He runs an IELTS coaching center

595
00:48:41.601 --> 00:48:42.851
He is smart in his studies

596
00:48:43.601 --> 00:48:46.226
So we didn't marry him
because of his studies


597
00:48:46.560 --> 00:48:47.476
Correct

598
00:48:48.518 --> 00:48:49.726
This man is good

599
00:48:51.601 --> 00:48:54.935
I know him, he
came here that night


600
00:49:00.476 --> 00:49:02.893
Auntie, I think he has
a problem with his eyes


601
00:49:03.185 --> 00:49:05.435
He mistook someone else

602
00:49:06.810 --> 00:49:09.810
In my opinion, girls and boys
should have private conversations


603
00:49:10.851 --> 00:49:12.893
- Yes, you're right
- Sure


604
00:49:17.810 --> 00:49:21.435
My mother often told me that
we would marry you with a gun


605
00:49:22.601 --> 00:49:24.643
In fact, I don't like
anyone other than this


606
00:49:26.185 --> 00:49:29.518
You're the first girl who
approached me like a gun


607
00:49:31.226 --> 00:49:33.601
You should have asked me
before submitting your application


608
00:49:34.893 --> 00:49:37.351
What is the need?  Like
we'll match horoscopes?


609
00:49:38.226 --> 00:49:40.768
We have the same
hobbies, that's enough


610
00:49:41.768 --> 00:49:43.768
Hobbies alone are not
enough for a marriage


611
00:49:44.851 --> 00:49:46.310
You have to accept my terms

612
00:49:46.851 --> 00:49:47.976
What are your conditions?

613
00:49:48.893 --> 00:49:51.976
I have no problem if you
run an IELTS training center


614
00:49:52.976 --> 00:49:53.893
That's good

615
00:49:54.435 --> 00:49:57.560
I will take you in the morning
and pick you up in the afternoon


616
00:49:58.393 --> 00:49:59.851
That will save travel costs

617
00:50:00.226 --> 00:50:03.601
Of course, we'll buy
vegetables on the way home


618
00:50:03.976 --> 00:50:06.643
Is it necessary to buy
vegetables at the market?


619
00:50:06.976 --> 00:50:09.435
We grow vegetables at home
without harmful chemicals


620
00:50:09.518 --> 00:50:10.351
What?

621
00:50:10.768 --> 00:50:12.518
Are you on drugs?

622
00:50:13.226 --> 00:50:16.060
- What nonsense are you talking about?
- Then what do you want?


623
00:50:19.601 --> 00:50:20.643
I want to kill people

624
00:50:22.018 --> 00:50:23.060
What is this nonsense?

625
00:50:24.226 --> 00:50:25.810
I'll buy you a new
Android phone,


626
00:50:26.476 --> 00:50:28.060
then you can kill people in PUBG

627
00:50:29.268 --> 00:50:30.351
I'm serious

628
00:50:34.351 --> 00:50:36.143
We solved a murder case

629
00:50:36.851 --> 00:50:38.185
What is your dispute with them?

630
00:50:38.268 --> 00:50:39.560
Please tell me, who is he?

631
00:50:39.893 --> 00:50:41.726
Let's sit down and
solve this problem


632
00:50:43.518 --> 00:50:45.643
My dispute can only be
resolved by killing people


633
00:50:48.226 --> 00:50:52.143
Arjan, I want to be completely
transparent with you before our wedding


634
00:50:54.310 --> 00:50:55.685
As my mother said,

635
00:50:57.060 --> 00:50:58.893
a relationship based on lies

636
00:50:59.726 --> 00:51:01.351
never works

637
00:51:03.435 --> 00:51:05.601
I have the urge
to kill two people


638
00:51:06.476 --> 00:51:10.143
If you want to marry me,
you have to kill the first person


639
00:51:11.393 --> 00:51:13.226
And we will kill the
second person together


640
00:51:16.643 --> 00:51:18.268
What is the reason for killing them?

641
00:51:18.351 --> 00:51:20.685
I will answer your question
after you kill the man


642
00:51:21.685 --> 00:51:24.601
If you agree, let's
complete this alliance


643
00:51:27.893 --> 00:51:29.976
Do you like my brother?

644
00:51:31.351 --> 00:51:34.101
I like him, but you'll
have to ask him


645
00:51:34.351 --> 00:51:37.351
No need to ask him.
He really likes you


646
00:51:38.476 --> 00:51:39.601
Who knows

647
00:51:41.101 --> 00:51:43.185
sometimes people
change their minds quickly


648
00:51:45.351 --> 00:51:46.268
Let's go, Preet

649
00:52:00.060 --> 00:52:02.101
Use soap, it won't come off easily

650
00:52:09.226 --> 00:52:10.601
What did you say to the child?

651
00:52:11.726 --> 00:52:12.726
There isn't any

652
00:52:13.310 --> 00:52:15.143
He rejected me, not the other way around

653
00:52:15.685 --> 00:52:18.518
They proposed an alliance to
you, so why did they reject you?


654
00:52:19.351 --> 00:52:20.851
They came from
a reputable family


655
00:52:20.935 --> 00:52:22.976
You will live a happy
life in their house


656
00:52:23.643 --> 00:52:25.518
Why are you making things difficult?

657
00:52:25.685 --> 00:52:27.601
I earn a good income

658
00:52:28.185 --> 00:52:30.685
I don't need a reputable
family to be happy


659
00:52:33.351 --> 00:52:35.393
You're wasting my time for no reason

660
00:52:36.060 --> 00:52:36.893
Wake up, Rani

661
00:52:37.935 --> 00:52:39.601
He manipulates you

662
00:52:40.393 --> 00:52:42.768
Auntie, you scolded me for no reason

663
00:52:43.851 --> 00:52:45.310
I'll talk to your mother

664
00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:47.018
Then he will find you a partner

665
00:52:47.435 --> 00:52:48.935
And I will find him a partner

666
00:52:50.601 --> 00:52:53.893
My mother, they
told her no, not yes


667
00:52:55.935 --> 00:52:57.976
Stop reading newspapers all day

668
00:53:02.185 --> 00:53:04.393
You can try installing it
as many times as you want


669
00:53:04.518 --> 00:53:06.101
It no longer fits on your finger

670
00:53:06.560 --> 00:53:07.726
I told you

671
00:53:08.851 --> 00:53:11.226
That girl is crazy, but
you don't listen to me


672
00:53:11.393 --> 00:53:13.560
Friends, pray to
God that he is safe


673
00:53:14.310 --> 00:53:16.185
Otherwise, he will
turn you into a dog


674
00:53:16.268 --> 00:53:18.518
Residents who can
strip their lovers naked,


675
00:53:18.935 --> 00:53:20.768
how can showering
the groom with flowers?


676
00:53:20.935 --> 00:53:23.060
Hasty decisions make
you Jatts make mistakes


677
00:53:23.518 --> 00:53:26.310
You didn't even get the
girl and you also lost money


678
00:53:29.768 --> 00:53:33.268
Arjan, what happened to Deep?

679
00:53:35.060 --> 00:53:35.893
There isn't any

680
00:53:36.310 --> 00:53:38.393
If you want, you can
tell me.  I'll be back


681
00:53:39.518 --> 00:53:42.185
Sister, he asked
him to kill two people


682
00:53:45.101 --> 00:53:47.310
OK, if you don't want to tell me

683
00:53:49.310 --> 00:53:50.560
But stay away from them

684
00:53:53.268 --> 00:53:54.143
Let's go

685
00:53:54.560 --> 00:53:55.476
Come on

686
00:54:33.601 --> 00:54:37.060
Did your mother tell you to rely on
that boy to maintain the relationship?


687
00:54:37.810 --> 00:54:38.810
He didn't tell

688
00:54:39.726 --> 00:54:42.268
that trust is necessary for
a successful relationship?


689
00:54:43.768 --> 00:54:46.810
If you were so capable, you
would kill the first person alone


690
00:54:48.768 --> 00:54:50.476
I don't understand what you mean

691
00:54:51.685 --> 00:54:52.601
I understand it

692
00:54:53.268 --> 00:54:56.268
Here, 45 thousand.  I'll give you
the remaining 5 thousand later


693
00:54:58.143 --> 00:54:59.518
Give me the full amount later

694
00:55:01.351 --> 00:55:04.185
Your ego was hurt because I rejected you

695
00:55:06.310 --> 00:55:07.351
You rejected me?

696
00:55:07.976 --> 00:55:09.018
I reject you

697
00:55:09.310 --> 00:55:11.476
I don't even care
about a girl like you

698
00:55:12.768 --> 00:55:13.601
Go

699
00:55:15.268 --> 00:55:16.435
Go away from here

700
00:55:19.726 --> 00:55:21.518
Put your finger down

701
00:55:22.685 --> 00:55:24.518
I don't like men like you

702
00:55:25.310 --> 00:55:27.351
Guy showing finger at girl

703
00:55:29.143 --> 00:55:30.185
Take it down

704
00:55:30.435 --> 00:55:31.643
This is my finger

705
00:55:32.601 --> 00:55:33.976
and it will stay like this

706
00:55:36.310 --> 00:55:38.018
Put your finger down

707
00:56:20.851 --> 00:56:22.351
You're strong

708
00:56:22.601 --> 00:56:24.060
Showing strength to a girl

709
00:56:49.018 --> 00:56:51.310
What if I get killed while
trying to kill that person?


710
00:56:52.185 --> 00:56:53.435
Or if I'm in prison?

711
00:56:54.060 --> 00:56:55.560
What will happen to us?

712
00:56:58.601 --> 00:56:59.976
I like guns

713
00:57:01.185 --> 00:57:02.226
I will not betray you

714
00:57:08.226 --> 00:57:09.101
Who is that man?

715
00:57:11.351 --> 00:57:13.226
Rasool Puria Zaildaar Rana

716
00:57:28.101 --> 00:57:30.393
What is it?  Let's close the shop

717
00:57:31.310 --> 00:57:32.143
Let

718
00:57:45.435 --> 00:57:48.393
Friend, where are you lost?

719
00:57:51.560 --> 00:57:53.810
Grandpa, you kept
this gun with great love


720
00:57:54.393 --> 00:57:56.268
Have you ever shot anyone?

721
00:57:58.601 --> 00:57:59.476
I fired it once

722
00:58:00.935 --> 00:58:03.560
In 1947 during the partition

723
00:58:06.810 --> 00:58:09.143
During that time, there
were attacks on the camps


724
00:58:10.976 --> 00:58:15.476
Once a group of people came
to our camp to take young girls


725
00:58:18.268 --> 00:58:20.393
At that time, I used
this for the first time


726
00:58:22.810 --> 00:58:24.143
What happened next, grandpa?

727
00:58:25.226 --> 00:58:26.101
What is next?

728
00:58:27.393 --> 00:58:28.851
I don't count bullets

729
00:58:30.226 --> 00:58:32.185
but the ground was stained with blood

730
00:58:35.518 --> 00:58:37.101
You and my father are legends

731
00:58:38.560 --> 00:58:39.893
He also did amazing things

732
00:58:42.351 --> 00:58:44.726
I feel like I can just
shoot at the target


733
00:58:46.976 --> 00:58:48.476
I'll probably never get the
chance to shoot someone


734
00:58:48.560 --> 00:58:50.476
It's good if you never
get a chance like that


735
00:58:51.310 --> 00:58:53.560
But when such a situation arises,

736
00:58:55.143 --> 00:58:58.185
the reason for using
a firearm must be legal


737
00:59:02.060 --> 00:59:03.768
What if we don't know the reason?

738
00:59:06.643 --> 00:59:10.018
So that relationship determines
whether you want to use a firearm on him


739
01:01:25.685 --> 01:01:26.560
Hey, look

740
01:02:41.893 --> 01:02:42.851
Prey

741
01:02:45.685 --> 01:02:46.518
is ours

742
01:02:48.685 --> 01:02:50.893
Hunter looks cool
while hunting lion


743
01:02:54.768 --> 01:02:55.601
not a pig

744
01:03:17.435 --> 01:03:19.226
You're an extraordinary man

745
01:03:30.435 --> 01:03:33.476
By the way, what's your name?

746
01:03:34.643 --> 01:03:36.685
Which village are you from?

747
01:03:39.601 --> 01:03:40.893
I'm Pablo

748
01:03:42.185 --> 01:03:43.393
from a Mexican village

749
01:03:47.893 --> 01:03:49.560
You're an extraordinary man

750
01:03:50.476 --> 01:03:53.101
Even your alcohol is amazing

751
01:03:56.101 --> 01:03:59.810
Friends, why are you sitting still?

752
01:04:00.018 --> 01:04:01.101
Come on, let's drink

753
01:06:39.560 --> 01:06:40.643
Look

754
01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:46.393
Is he the one?

755
01:06:47.726 --> 01:06:48.560
Yes

756
01:06:49.935 --> 01:06:50.893
Kill him

757
01:06:51.518 --> 01:06:53.893
I have kidnapped him,
and I will kill him too


758
01:06:55.351 --> 01:06:56.726
Just tell me why

759
01:06:57.226 --> 01:06:58.435
Sister, who are you?

760
01:06:58.518 --> 01:07:00.185
Look at him again

761
01:07:01.143 --> 01:07:02.893
Who are you, sister?
Brother, please


762
01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:05.893
Why did you kill
me on his orders?


763
01:07:06.226 --> 01:07:09.226
Sister?  Don't you recognize me?

764
01:07:10.851 --> 01:07:12.726
Arjan, kill him

765
01:07:14.310 --> 01:07:15.685
I've never killed anyone

766
01:07:17.268 --> 01:07:18.518
This is a big thing for me

767
01:07:19.185 --> 01:07:21.976
- Brother - Just tell me the
reason, then it will be easier for me


768
01:07:22.060 --> 01:07:23.810
We drink together

769
01:07:23.893 --> 01:07:25.268
Show compassion

770
01:07:25.351 --> 01:07:26.476
Shut up!

771
01:07:27.310 --> 01:07:29.018
Tell me, why are
you so stubborn?


772
01:07:29.226 --> 01:07:30.101
You're stubborn

773
01:07:30.726 --> 01:07:32.476
Keep the promises we make to each other

774
01:07:32.768 --> 01:07:34.893
Kill him first, then
I'll tell you why


775
01:07:35.643 --> 01:07:37.060
He was 1 foot away from me

776
01:07:38.476 --> 01:07:40.560
- Tell me the reason
- My mother is waiting for me at home


777
01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:41.476
Please let me go

778
01:07:41.726 --> 01:07:42.810
Shut up!

779
01:07:44.268 --> 01:07:45.601
I will not obey you

780
01:07:46.143 --> 01:07:48.976
If you can't kill him, leave him.
I'll shoot him


781
01:07:49.060 --> 01:07:51.268
I have never done
anything evil in my life


782
01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:53.060
Brother, no

783
01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:08.935
Mehar

784
01:09:54.393 --> 01:09:56.560
If you are fluent in
English pronunciation


785
01:09:56.726 --> 01:09:58.518
then half of your
English is perfect


786
01:09:59.060 --> 01:10:00.851
How do we pronounce it?

787
01:10:01.185 --> 01:10:02.351
Gurdeep, tell me

788
01:10:02.810 --> 01:10:03.726
Schedule

789
01:10:04.060 --> 01:10:05.101
Schedule, ma'am

790
01:10:06.393 --> 01:10:07.268
Correct

791
01:10:07.726 --> 01:10:09.143
You're smart

792
01:10:09.435 --> 01:10:10.768
Let them learn too

793
01:10:11.268 --> 01:10:14.560
From your hard work, you
were able to pass the civil exam


794
01:10:15.060 --> 01:10:18.435
No, ma'am.  I just want to
get 7 bands and go to Canada


795
01:10:19.185 --> 01:10:20.060
Canada

796
01:10:20.643 --> 01:10:21.476
Canada

797
01:10:21.893 --> 01:10:22.810
Canada

798
01:10:22.935 --> 01:10:24.643
Now I will tell
you the next word


799
01:10:33.435 --> 01:10:34.518
Where do you want to go?

800
01:10:34.768 --> 01:10:36.268
Ma'am, Canada

801
01:10:36.976 --> 01:10:38.226
I asked about the moment

802
01:10:38.726 --> 01:10:40.351
I'm going to the village

803
01:10:40.435 --> 01:10:41.976
Come on up, we'll take you

804
01:10:43.143 --> 01:10:44.768
How many siblings
do you have, Mehar?


805
01:10:45.935 --> 01:10:47.393
I don't have any siblings

806
01:10:48.393 --> 01:10:49.268
just a sister

807
01:10:50.018 --> 01:10:51.351
What does your father do?

808
01:10:51.768 --> 01:10:54.518
My dad has passed away

809
01:10:54.851 --> 01:10:56.393
I only have mother

810
01:10:56.643 --> 01:10:58.143
Do you rent out your land?

811
01:10:59.101 --> 01:11:02.851
No, ma'am, we don't have land.
Okay


812
01:11:03.268 --> 01:11:05.726
My father is a truck driver.
What is your mother's job?


813
01:11:06.435 --> 01:11:08.893
My mother works as a maid

814
01:11:09.435 --> 01:11:10.935
We have two buffalo at home

815
01:11:11.226 --> 01:11:12.393
One of them is pregnant

816
01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:14.351
I pray it's a girl

817
01:11:16.101 --> 01:11:18.060
Do you know about Canada visa fees?

818
01:11:18.143 --> 01:11:19.601
Around 20 to 25 lakhs

819
01:11:20.226 --> 01:11:21.851
Nothing to worry about

820
01:11:22.226 --> 01:11:25.810
My groom will bear
all the expenses


821
01:11:25.851 --> 01:11:27.851
What is a real marriage
or a contract marriage?


822
01:11:28.143 --> 01:11:31.101
A real wedding, Mom.
We love each other


823
01:11:33.143 --> 01:11:37.018
Impressive, you have planned
your career and future carefully


824
01:11:37.851 --> 01:11:40.726
Your hard work will definitely
bring success in your life


825
01:11:41.185 --> 01:11:42.185
Thank you mom

826
01:11:54.060 --> 01:11:55.768
Mom, this is my teacher

827
01:11:56.393 --> 01:11:57.810
Your daughter is smart

828
01:11:59.643 --> 01:12:00.893
May you be blessed

829
01:12:01.018 --> 01:12:02.268
Come on, let's have some tea

830
01:12:02.643 --> 01:12:04.935
No problem, we'll come
another day for lunch


831
01:12:05.351 --> 01:12:06.226
Of course

832
01:12:13.268 --> 01:12:15.435
Boy will it ruin the reputation
of our service center


833
01:12:16.143 --> 01:12:19.185
They cannot speak or read well

834
01:12:19.685 --> 01:12:21.226
There are no
comments on their posts


835
01:12:22.185 --> 01:12:24.060
Mehar gets full marks again

836
01:12:26.018 --> 01:12:27.893
He was absent for the last 2-3 days

837
01:12:28.518 --> 01:12:29.476
I hope he's okay

838
01:12:29.685 --> 01:12:31.310
Maybe he's sick

839
01:12:39.351 --> 01:12:40.226
This

840
01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:45.268
Who is the man fighting with Mehar?

841
01:12:47.726 --> 01:12:49.518
It looks like he is the
sponsor for Canada


842
01:12:51.268 --> 01:12:53.310
I think he's creating a
scene for the wedding


843
01:12:54.851 --> 01:12:57.685
He's innocent, so I'm
sure he manipulated her


844
01:13:05.851 --> 01:13:07.476
Does he refuse to marry you?

845
01:13:08.935 --> 01:13:11.643
Does not matter.
Let's go for a ride


846
01:13:13.685 --> 01:13:14.601
Come on

847
01:13:15.143 --> 01:13:16.476
Don't worry

848
01:13:17.476 --> 01:13:19.351
Let me tell you
about my condition


849
01:13:19.601 --> 01:13:21.726
For four years, he chased me

850
01:13:22.018 --> 01:13:23.601
and said, <i>I will marry you, Rani</i>

851
01:13:23.976 --> 01:13:25.101
<i>I can not live without you.</i>

852
01:13:25.185 --> 01:13:28.893
But when I mentioned marriage, he said
his family was against love marriage


853
01:13:29.935 --> 01:13:31.643
I don't feel hopeless

854
01:13:31.810 --> 01:13:33.226
I told him to leave

855
01:13:33.560 --> 01:13:36.643
Why did you reject me?
I will beat you up


856
01:13:36.851 --> 01:13:39.226
- The same thing happened to Deep
- Yes


857
01:13:39.476 --> 01:13:41.143
I forgot about him

858
01:13:41.768 --> 01:13:44.476
- Yes, you opened this service
center after leaving it - Ma'am


859
01:13:45.060 --> 01:13:47.851
He recorded a video
of me with his friends


860
01:13:51.351 --> 01:13:53.518
He forced me to come
to Shimla with him


861
01:13:54.268 --> 01:13:57.143
If I refuse, he
will leak the video


862
01:13:59.018 --> 01:14:00.518
If he leaks the video

863
01:14:01.726 --> 01:14:03.643
my mother will commit suicide

864
01:14:04.476 --> 01:14:06.143
I do not know what to do

865
01:14:09.226 --> 01:14:12.810
I feel like killing myself
here, in front of the train


866
01:14:14.018 --> 01:14:15.935
Why did you die?
Stop talking nonsense


867
01:14:16.685 --> 01:14:18.726
We are with you, Mehar.
Don't worry


868
01:14:19.810 --> 01:14:22.643
You go to the institute, we
will go and delete your video


869
01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:30.435
They come

870
01:14:32.101 --> 01:14:35.185
It seems the girl reported
me to her English teacher


871
01:14:38.685 --> 01:14:39.935
Delete Mehar's video

872
01:14:43.101 --> 01:14:43.935
Are you stupid?

873
01:14:44.935 --> 01:14:46.893
Delete the video

874
01:14:47.435 --> 01:14:49.851
or I will file
charges against you


875
01:14:50.101 --> 01:14:51.476
Is it true?

876
01:14:52.435 --> 01:14:53.935
I am very scared

877
01:14:54.143 --> 01:14:56.976
- I swear, I'm scared
- Don't act smart


878
01:14:57.518 --> 01:14:59.351
Do what I say

879
01:15:02.393 --> 01:15:03.435
Call Ginda

880
01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:10.101
Yes Ginda, Rana
wants to talk to you


881
01:15:11.810 --> 01:15:12.685
Hello

882
01:15:13.643 --> 01:15:14.768
Ginda

883
01:15:15.976 --> 01:15:17.851
Chanchal America and Naughty India

884
01:15:19.060 --> 01:15:20.601
Upload videos on the site

885
01:15:21.810 --> 01:15:24.393
- Not only in Punjab, Mehar's deeds
- No, please


886
01:15:24.435 --> 01:15:26.685
- will be seen by all of India.
Upload the video - Please


887
01:15:26.768 --> 01:15:27.726
I'm really sorry

888
01:15:28.101 --> 01:15:29.851
If you are annoyed because of my words

889
01:15:29.935 --> 01:15:31.476
I apologize to you

890
01:15:31.685 --> 01:15:34.601
If his family sees the video,
they will commit suicide


891
01:15:34.643 --> 01:15:37.726
Please, we won't say
a word to the police


892
01:15:37.851 --> 01:15:39.935
Please delete the video

893
01:15:40.018 --> 01:15:43.310
Sorry, madam, but
you ruined my plans


894
01:15:43.851 --> 01:15:45.101
Don't worry, brother

895
01:15:45.351 --> 01:15:48.143
Forget Kasauli, we
will go to Bathinda


896
01:15:49.976 --> 01:15:51.768
Sir, please

897
01:15:52.060 --> 01:15:53.268
Please, I ask

898
01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:54.435
See you

899
01:16:02.518 --> 01:16:03.768
Come on up, Rani.  Start the car

900
01:16:12.351 --> 01:16:14.768
I have seen this video

901
01:16:22.518 --> 01:16:24.935
Awesome, Mehar, you are trending

902
01:16:38.226 --> 01:16:39.851
Mehar's video goes viral

903
01:16:44.018 --> 01:16:45.768
I made a big mistake

904
01:16:47.893 --> 01:16:49.935
I made a big mistake

905
01:16:54.893 --> 01:16:56.351
Mehar didn't answer my calls

906
01:16:57.643 --> 01:16:58.560
He must be at home

907
01:16:59.268 --> 01:17:00.185
He must be at home

908
01:17:18.685 --> 01:17:20.351
Aunty, where is Mehar?

909
01:17:21.018 --> 01:17:22.060
Where is Mehar?

910
01:17:22.185 --> 01:17:25.393
He's not home yet.
I don't know where he is


911
01:17:28.476 --> 01:17:29.601
Don't cry

912
01:17:29.685 --> 01:17:31.101
I'll find it

913
01:17:36.851 --> 01:17:40.851
I feel like I died
under a train here


914
01:17:41.560 --> 01:17:43.143
Drive fast, Rani

915
01:17:48.601 --> 01:17:49.601
Mehar

916
01:17:53.685 --> 01:17:54.518
Mehar!

917
01:17:55.060 --> 01:17:57.226
He made a mistake, Mehar

918
01:17:57.476 --> 01:17:58.935
He will be punished

919
01:18:00.101 --> 01:18:02.101
Mehar, are you listening to me?

920
01:18:03.018 --> 01:18:04.226
You're innocent

921
01:18:04.351 --> 01:18:06.060
Mehar, I'm with you.  Come on

922
01:18:06.518 --> 01:18:08.143
Mehar, you are brave

923
01:18:10.018 --> 01:18:11.268
Listen to me, Mehar!

924
01:18:13.851 --> 01:18:14.685
Mehar!

925
01:18:19.518 --> 01:18:20.518
No

926
01:18:26.101 --> 01:18:26.976
Mehar!

927
01:18:37.643 --> 01:18:38.560
Mehar!

928
01:19:27.268 --> 01:19:28.768
I will not obey you

929
01:19:29.518 --> 01:19:31.351
If you can't shoot
him, leave him


930
01:19:31.476 --> 01:19:32.726
I'll shoot him

931
01:19:47.601 --> 01:19:48.935
Why are you barking like a dog?

932
01:19:53.560 --> 01:19:54.810
If I want to kill you

933
01:19:55.435 --> 01:19:57.685
I'll shoot you in the head

934
01:19:58.476 --> 01:19:59.226
Don't worry

935
01:19:59.726 --> 01:20:01.768
Nothing will happen to
you in these 3-4 hours


936
01:20:06.351 --> 01:20:08.518
The reasons will decide

937
01:20:09.685 --> 01:20:11.560
did I let you go to your mother

938
01:20:13.101 --> 01:20:14.476
or you go to heaven

939
01:20:17.393 --> 01:20:18.851
I go

940
01:21:30.310 --> 01:21:33.060
We only kill someone
after knowing the reason


941
01:23:10.768 --> 01:23:12.643
Isn't he Rana Jaildar?

942
01:23:13.518 --> 01:23:15.685
Yes, he is from Rasulpur

943
01:23:16.726 --> 01:23:17.810
He is a hunter

944
01:23:19.435 --> 01:23:20.518
He died

945
01:23:21.601 --> 01:23:23.226
Send the body for autopsy

946
01:23:29.435 --> 01:23:30.643
Greetings, Mr Randhawa

947
01:23:31.185 --> 01:23:32.893
- Welcome
- Greetings!


948
01:23:33.185 --> 01:23:35.060
He is Paramveer Singh from CI staff

949
01:23:35.435 --> 01:23:36.185
Regards!

950
01:23:36.268 --> 01:23:37.976
He came here for investigation

951
01:23:38.060 --> 01:23:40.351
- Sure
- Sir, look at this bullet


952
01:23:41.726 --> 01:23:42.685
This is a 9mm shell

953
01:23:43.893 --> 01:23:46.851
Has anyone purchased a cartridge
this size in the last few days?


954
01:23:47.976 --> 01:23:51.018
No sir.  Nobody had ever
bought a cartridge this big


955
01:23:52.393 --> 01:23:54.060
Was there an incident?

956
01:23:54.476 --> 01:23:55.810
Yes, Mr Randhawa

957
01:23:56.685 --> 01:24:00.768
Someone died on the train tracks

958
01:24:01.560 --> 01:24:03.851
And the same guy got shot
in a movie theater last week


959
01:24:05.851 --> 01:24:08.185
Licensed firearms are
not used in such incidents


960
01:24:08.601 --> 01:24:10.851
Firearms and bullets for such incidents
usually come from Uttar Pradesh


961
01:24:10.935 --> 01:24:12.268
These ingredients
are not sourced locally


962
01:24:17.351 --> 01:24:18.893
- Who's he?
- Arjan


963
01:24:19.268 --> 01:24:20.851
He is Randhwa's nephew

964
01:24:21.476 --> 01:24:22.935
He is an expert in making firearms

965
01:24:23.310 --> 01:24:26.351
- Their story is quite well known
- Sir, let's do an investigation


966
01:24:29.476 --> 01:24:31.393
We can listen to their
stories another day


967
01:24:32.185 --> 01:24:33.018
Okay

968
01:24:41.726 --> 01:24:42.893
Jai Hind, sir.  
- Jai Hind

969
01:24:42.935 --> 01:24:43.810
Please sit

970
01:24:48.601 --> 01:24:51.768
- I met DGP sir at the CM's office
- OK, sir


971
01:24:51.810 --> 01:24:55.560
- He told me that you were handling
the Rana murder case - Yes sir


972
01:24:58.143 --> 01:24:59.601
He is my son's friend

973
01:25:01.018 --> 01:25:04.726
Did you know, children's
friends are like family


974
01:25:04.851 --> 01:25:05.685
Yes

975
01:25:06.268 --> 01:25:07.851
By the way, what is
the status of the case?


976
01:25:07.935 --> 01:25:09.685
Is an investigation underway?

977
01:25:09.685 --> 01:25:10.435
Yes

978
01:25:10.685 --> 01:25:12.101
We are waiting for the forensic report

979
01:25:13.393 --> 01:25:15.003
After that it will
be ascertained


980
01:25:15.015 --> 01:25:17.018
whether it was
intentional or situational


981
01:25:18.018 --> 01:25:20.851
Rana was killed on the railway track,

982
01:25:21.226 --> 01:25:22.810
10 kilometers from the forest

983
01:25:23.810 --> 01:25:25.226
The killer meets Rana in the jungle

984
01:25:25.726 --> 01:25:28.185
They hunted together and drank together

985
01:25:29.185 --> 01:25:30.435
Everything was fine until then

986
01:25:30.768 --> 01:25:31.976
The question is what happens

987
01:25:32.060 --> 01:25:33.851
after everyone goes to bed

988
01:25:34.643 --> 01:25:38.851
or what situation occurred
to cause Rana's death?


989
01:25:40.226 --> 01:25:41.476
If the murder was
planned beforehand


990
01:25:42.018 --> 01:25:43.810
so why throw a party?

991
01:25:45.185 --> 01:25:48.351
The most important thing is that
Rana was killed on the train tracks,


992
01:25:48.351 --> 01:25:50.185
10 kilometers away from the forest

993
01:25:51.685 --> 01:25:53.101
Why not in the forest?

994
01:25:55.810 --> 01:25:57.393
Do you have a sketch of the shooter?

995
01:25:58.643 --> 01:25:59.643
Yes. I have

996
01:26:01.226 --> 01:26:02.351
But that's not clear

997
01:26:03.435 --> 01:26:05.726
Each person gives a
different picture of the killer


998
01:26:09.476 --> 01:26:12.851
They were all probably
drunk.  All they need is alcohol


999
01:26:14.643 --> 01:26:17.185
OK, I'll go.
I have a cabinet meeting


1000
01:26:19.518 --> 01:26:22.351
Mouser will follow up
on the case with you


1001
01:26:22.976 --> 01:26:23.935
I will go

1002
01:26:24.060 --> 01:26:24.935
See you, kid

1003
01:26:34.893 --> 01:26:39.310
Paramveer Singh, what do you think?

1004
01:26:39.976 --> 01:26:42.143
Is this situational or intentional?

1005
01:26:43.685 --> 01:26:45.060
Do you suspect anyone?

1006
01:26:46.726 --> 01:26:49.018
I wish I was suspicious

1007
01:26:50.476 --> 01:26:51.643
Then you wouldn't be here

1008
01:26:52.393 --> 01:26:54.518
You're going to do someone's autopsy

1009
01:26:57.810 --> 01:26:59.810
Bring tea to the police inspector

1010
01:27:00.601 --> 01:27:02.226
And bring my things

1011
01:27:16.393 --> 01:27:18.476
Shopping for a wedding?

1012
01:27:18.768 --> 01:27:20.560
With Jaggi?

1013
01:27:21.476 --> 01:27:22.351
Do you know him?

1014
01:27:22.893 --> 01:27:24.976
I know him, he's a bastard

1015
01:27:25.310 --> 01:27:26.560
What do you mean?

1016
01:27:26.768 --> 01:27:28.768
Don't marry him,
we will kill him


1017
01:27:29.101 --> 01:27:30.435
How are you going to kill him?

1018
01:27:30.810 --> 01:27:31.893
Who are you really?

1019
01:27:32.560 --> 01:27:33.518
Do I know you?

1020
01:27:33.935 --> 01:27:36.226
Hello, hey!  Listen!

1021
01:27:46.768 --> 01:27:47.643
Hi, Nimmi

1022
01:27:48.018 --> 01:27:49.893
Jaggi, I met a girl at the mall

1023
01:27:50.018 --> 01:27:52.476
And he said he would kill you.
What is going on?


1024
01:27:53.060 --> 01:27:54.185
Relax, I'm safe.

1025
01:27:54.351 --> 01:27:56.435
Back home.  See you

1026
01:27:57.893 --> 01:27:59.268
Brother, Nimmi called

1027
01:27:59.435 --> 01:28:00.810
He met a girl at the mall

1028
01:28:01.018 --> 01:28:04.185
The girl asked him not to marry,
because they would kill her husband


1029
01:28:04.518 --> 01:28:05.976
Are they working together?

1030
01:28:06.560 --> 01:28:08.435
Don't worry, I'm with you

1031
01:28:08.726 --> 01:28:09.601
Now

1032
01:28:09.726 --> 01:28:11.726
I'm not the one who's worried

1033
01:28:12.226 --> 01:28:15.518
The day after my wedding, and
the next day I will fly to England


1034
01:28:16.726 --> 01:28:18.976
What if the threat is 1% genuine?

1035
01:28:20.351 --> 01:28:23.351
We will come to
the wedding and see


1036
01:28:24.143 --> 01:28:26.810
Don't just look,
deal with the problem


1037
01:28:28.851 --> 01:28:30.310
I want that man alive

1038
01:28:36.060 --> 01:28:38.976
When the bride and groom come
on stage, you will start smoking


1039
01:28:39.268 --> 01:28:40.851
That's a DJ's job

1040
01:28:41.018 --> 01:28:43.601
No, the DJ will play the song

1041
01:28:44.226 --> 01:28:46.643
How will he start smoking?

1042
01:28:47.101 --> 01:28:49.101
Brother, they have a system

1043
01:28:50.143 --> 01:28:51.893
OK, so you don't have this system

1044
01:28:52.893 --> 01:28:55.726
Brother, tell me
your wedding date


1045
01:28:55.976 --> 01:28:58.101
As soon as I find the
girl, I'll give you the date


1046
01:28:58.226 --> 01:29:00.143
You've been babbling
for the last hour and


1047
01:29:00.226 --> 01:29:03.726
you came here to book
a palace without a girl


1048
01:29:04.810 --> 01:29:06.976
Tell me, where is the bathroom?

1049
01:29:07.268 --> 01:29:08.143
Straight

1050
01:29:09.018 --> 01:29:09.893
Thank You

1051
01:29:10.185 --> 01:29:12.310
Hey, flush after using the toilet

1052
01:29:12.476 --> 01:29:13.768
Don't make a mess

1053
01:29:13.851 --> 01:29:15.185
Stupid

1054
01:30:02.393 --> 01:30:04.435
You shouldn't have told that girl

1055
01:30:05.893 --> 01:30:07.226
We had a fight over a girl

1056
01:30:07.935 --> 01:30:09.560
so letting him know is important

1057
01:30:11.976 --> 01:30:13.643
The girls couldn't digest the secret

1058
01:30:38.643 --> 01:30:42.851
So let's dance?

1059
01:31:14.685 --> 01:31:16.601
I don't understand one thing

1060
01:31:18.726 --> 01:31:21.435
they have guns to tear down

1061
01:31:21.518 --> 01:31:23.226
tents but they want
security from us


1062
01:31:29.476 --> 01:31:31.685
- Let's have a snack
- Let's


1063
01:31:44.935 --> 01:31:46.310
What are you doing here?

1064
01:31:55.560 --> 01:31:56.601
I came for the wedding

1065
01:31:57.226 --> 01:31:58.476
Even I came here for a wedding

1066
01:32:04.018 --> 01:32:05.726
You can't be on the groom's side

1067
01:32:06.726 --> 01:32:08.351
What relationship do
you have with the bride?


1068
01:32:09.685 --> 01:32:10.935
Not like that

1069
01:32:12.185 --> 01:32:13.935
The bride's uncle is
a friend of my father's


1070
01:32:16.726 --> 01:32:20.226
Grandpa is sick, so I
came just to give him a gift


1071
01:32:23.143 --> 01:32:23.976
Go and meet him

1072
01:32:25.893 --> 01:32:27.101
I'll see him later

1073
01:32:30.976 --> 01:32:31.893
Go and pee

1074
01:33:10.101 --> 01:33:11.518
The gun is gone

1075
01:33:13.018 --> 01:33:14.643
But we have to do this today

1076
01:33:15.143 --> 01:33:16.268
We won't get another chance

1077
01:33:16.685 --> 01:33:18.060
Tomorrow Jaggi will fly to England

1078
01:35:47.351 --> 01:35:50.476
Who did you chat
with at the wedding?


1079
01:35:52.268 --> 01:35:53.476
He's my brother-in-law

1080
01:35:55.560 --> 01:35:57.315
Looking at him, it seems
like the relationship


1081
01:35:57.327 --> 01:35:58.643
between the two
of you is not good


1082
01:36:00.893 --> 01:36:02.518
We don't have a good relationship

1083
01:36:03.018 --> 01:36:03.851
Why?

1084
01:36:05.226 --> 01:36:06.560
Old story

1085
01:36:07.685 --> 01:36:09.435
Our first meeting
went something like this


1086
01:36:17.851 --> 01:36:19.768
Ten years ago, the owner died,

1087
01:36:20.518 --> 01:36:21.935
and the case is closed

1088
01:36:22.268 --> 01:36:24.435
Since then, no one has
come forward to claim it


1089
01:36:26.226 --> 01:36:27.351
What's your price?

1090
01:36:27.726 --> 01:36:30.768
You're the boss, how
can I ask you for money?


1091
01:36:31.310 --> 01:36:32.726
Just consider it a gift from me

1092
01:36:33.810 --> 01:36:36.601
Compensate me
for taking the risk


1093
01:36:36.935 --> 01:36:38.393
Tell me how many?

1094
01:36:40.310 --> 01:36:41.393
Ten lakhs

1095
01:36:44.101 --> 01:36:44.976
Agreed

1096
01:36:46.310 --> 01:36:48.476
Sir, this is for you

1097
01:36:49.185 --> 01:36:51.560
This is a court order for
the firearms stored here


1098
01:36:52.435 --> 01:36:53.893
You came here after 10 years

1099
01:36:54.476 --> 01:36:57.935
We fought the case, and
yesterday we got permission


1100
01:36:58.393 --> 01:37:00.643
Good, you got here just in time

1101
01:37:00.810 --> 01:37:04.601
Mauser Brar, son of Darbara Singh Brar

1102
01:37:05.310 --> 01:37:07.018
He admires your gun

1103
01:37:07.435 --> 01:37:09.185
That was my father's last memory

1104
01:37:10.226 --> 01:37:13.060
He uses this gun to shoot the
villain Jagu, who kidnaps girls


1105
01:37:13.185 --> 01:37:14.560
from the land of wrestling Jagrau, Das

1106
01:37:14.643 --> 01:37:16.935
He sacrificed his
life to save the girls


1107
01:37:17.726 --> 01:37:20.518
Are you the son of Jagraj Singh
from the Asle Wale Sardar lineage?


1108
01:37:20.976 --> 01:37:23.601
Yes, so it's not for sale

1109
01:37:24.435 --> 01:37:25.476
That's our family heritage

1110
01:37:31.101 --> 01:37:32.685
Your words resonate with me

1111
01:37:33.768 --> 01:37:35.476
You honor your father's legacy

1112
01:37:36.310 --> 01:37:38.393
Just like me, it
runs in our blood


1113
01:37:41.643 --> 01:37:43.351
But I really like this gun

1114
01:37:44.726 --> 01:37:46.060
It costs just 2 lakhs

1115
01:37:48.143 --> 01:37:49.726
but I am willing
to offer you 25 lakhs

1116
01:37:51.393 --> 01:37:52.810
As I mentioned,
it's not for sale


1117
01:37:54.310 --> 01:37:55.643
Don't be stubborn

1118
01:37:57.685 --> 01:37:58.518
30 lakhs

1119
01:38:02.518 --> 01:38:04.768
There is a difference between
your bloodline and mine


1120
01:38:06.768 --> 01:38:08.476
It can't be bought with money

1121
01:38:11.351 --> 01:38:12.268
Thank you sir

1122
01:38:29.060 --> 01:38:31.476
After a few months,
he proposed to my sister


1123
01:38:32.851 --> 01:38:35.768
I'm not ready yet,
but my sister loves it


1124
01:38:37.351 --> 01:38:38.810
And my family also agrees

1125
01:38:41.476 --> 01:38:42.560
Do you like it?

1126
01:38:43.351 --> 01:38:45.643
I love it, how about you?

1127
01:38:47.851 --> 01:38:50.393
I doubt he wants revenge on me

1128
01:38:51.351 --> 01:38:54.435
He doesn't think like that,
you worry for no reason


1129
01:38:57.101 --> 01:38:58.518
After all, this is about your wedding

1130
01:39:00.143 --> 01:39:02.601
If you don't like it, I
will reject the proposal


1131
01:39:03.893 --> 01:39:05.101
I want your happiness

1132
01:39:06.268 --> 01:39:07.393
I want your happiness

1133
01:39:08.101 --> 01:39:09.893
I'm really very happy

1134
01:39:10.351 --> 01:39:13.226
I love it so much,
I swear to you


1135
01:39:15.018 --> 01:39:16.768
OK, say yes to him

1136
01:39:17.643 --> 01:39:19.393
If he molests you after the wedding

1137
01:39:20.143 --> 01:39:21.643
just tell me, I'll
take care of it


1138
01:39:22.685 --> 01:39:24.101
You always think negatively

1139
01:39:42.518 --> 01:39:44.393
So when should we
set a wedding date?


1140
01:39:48.643 --> 01:39:49.518
Where have you disappeared?

1141
01:39:51.851 --> 01:39:53.268
You've changed your mind once again

1142
01:39:54.268 --> 01:39:56.143
The minimum sentence
for one murder is 10 years


1143
01:39:56.976 --> 01:39:58.185
And it's about two murders

1144
01:40:01.185 --> 01:40:03.351
But I committed the second murder

1145
01:40:06.685 --> 01:40:08.018
I will not let any
harm come to you


1146
01:40:10.393 --> 01:40:12.351
The police will find me

1147
01:40:14.185 --> 01:40:15.893
I will definitely go to jail

1148
01:40:18.810 --> 01:40:22.018
I can't ruin your
life by marrying you


1149
01:40:28.226 --> 01:40:30.476
Maybe you were the
one who started all this


1150
01:40:32.851 --> 01:40:34.810
But that ends with my legacy

1151
01:40:37.060 --> 01:40:38.726
Now I am part of this legacy too

1152
01:40:41.060 --> 01:40:42.560
I'm not just an ordinary firearm

1153
01:40:44.226 --> 01:40:46.393
I am Asle Wale Sardar's firearm

1154
01:43:55.768 --> 01:43:57.226
Tomorrow, I want you to meet someone

1155
01:43:58.310 --> 01:43:59.143
Will you go?

1156
01:44:05.393 --> 01:44:06.935
Boy, if Mehar were alive today

1157
01:44:07.351 --> 01:44:09.726
we will come to your wedding

1158
01:44:10.310 --> 01:44:13.351
You still have to come, and that's
also one week before my wedding


1159
01:44:13.726 --> 01:44:15.768
How can I come one week early?

1160
01:44:16.018 --> 01:44:18.060
This house problem is stressing me out

1161
01:44:18.143 --> 01:44:19.018
What has happened?

1162
01:44:20.060 --> 01:44:21.643
The villagers
claimed the land we


1163
01:44:21.726 --> 01:44:23.351
lived on belonged
to the Panchayat


1164
01:44:24.101 --> 01:44:25.435
They want to build a well here

1165
01:44:25.768 --> 01:44:29.060
I don't even know where
I will live with my daughter


1166
01:44:33.893 --> 01:44:35.393
If only I had a son

1167
01:44:35.935 --> 01:44:38.060
he would not allow
anyone to enter our house


1168
01:44:42.435 --> 01:44:45.810
Auntie, don't worry.
Think of me as your child


1169
01:44:48.643 --> 01:44:49.768
I'll find a way

1170
01:44:54.601 --> 01:44:55.643
Thank you, son

1171
01:45:05.810 --> 01:45:06.976
Come in, Inspector

1172
01:45:07.810 --> 01:45:08.851
We are waiting for you

1173
01:45:09.643 --> 01:45:12.726
Your security is impressive.
I'll talk to CM about you


1174
01:45:13.643 --> 01:45:15.226
We will honor you
on January 26th


1175
01:45:15.351 --> 01:45:17.643
Please sit.  This
party is in your honor


1176
01:45:21.435 --> 01:45:23.476
What kind of security do you provide?

1177
01:45:24.726 --> 01:45:26.643
What food did you
eat at a wedding that


1178
01:45:26.726 --> 01:45:28.935
kept you unaware that
someone had been shot?


1179
01:45:29.060 --> 01:45:32.518
You don't even know who the killer is

1180
01:45:37.226 --> 01:45:38.435
Uncle, my gun is here

1181
01:45:39.226 --> 01:45:40.976
I went crazy looking for it

1182
01:45:41.768 --> 01:45:42.768
Thank goodness I found it

1183
01:45:42.851 --> 01:45:43.935
Are you satisfied now?

1184
01:45:45.435 --> 01:45:47.060
You've caused
us a lot of trouble


1185
01:45:48.518 --> 01:45:50.560
Jaggi was shot with this gun

1186
01:46:05.935 --> 01:46:08.393
You don't even know
how to hold a gun, you idiot


1187
01:46:08.601 --> 01:46:10.810
- You and your gun
- Brother, please


1188
01:46:10.893 --> 01:46:13.310
- Go get drunk
- What did I do wrong...


1189
01:46:13.393 --> 01:46:16.268
- Go get drunk
- Brother, that hurts


1190
01:46:16.393 --> 01:46:18.851
What did I do wrong?
What did I do wrong?


1191
01:46:23.101 --> 01:46:23.935
Sit there

1192
01:46:30.726 --> 01:46:31.560
This

1193
01:46:35.143 --> 01:46:36.101
Look at this photo

1194
01:46:36.893 --> 01:46:37.768
Do you know him?

1195
01:46:38.976 --> 01:46:40.310
He is the owner of a firearms shop

1196
01:46:40.476 --> 01:46:42.935
He is my brother-in-law.
He's there


1197
01:46:45.226 --> 01:46:46.726
The murderer must be a shooter

1198
01:46:47.226 --> 01:46:48.393
I have more photos

1199
01:46:48.935 --> 01:46:50.351
I will send it to you via
WhatsApp.  Check it out


1200
01:46:50.726 --> 01:46:52.601
You might recognize someone

1201
01:46:53.643 --> 01:46:57.435
The killer is in front of
you but we can't see him


1202
01:47:20.518 --> 01:47:24.476
Mom, have we recently received a wedding
invitation from the Sandhu family?


1203
01:47:27.310 --> 01:47:29.476
Do you like my brother?

1204
01:47:30.060 --> 01:47:32.351
Sometimes men change their minds

1205
01:47:33.226 --> 01:47:36.143
If you have to marry me
then you have to kill two men


1206
01:47:41.685 --> 01:47:42.893
Sorry I'm late

1207
01:47:43.476 --> 01:47:44.685
I conducted tests with my students

1208
01:47:45.768 --> 01:47:47.726
How many students do
you have at your institute?


1209
01:47:48.143 --> 01:47:50.726
I have one group of 20
students, five groups every day


1210
01:47:51.560 --> 01:47:54.560
Do you just teach them, or do
you also provide training for killing?


1211
01:47:56.310 --> 01:47:57.226
Who told you that?

1212
01:47:58.226 --> 01:48:00.226
The police have a photo of Arjan

1213
01:48:00.643 --> 01:48:02.185
They suspect him

1214
01:48:02.518 --> 01:48:04.143
Then I must have been in those photos

1215
01:48:05.310 --> 01:48:06.685
That's why you called me here

1216
01:48:07.435 --> 01:48:09.768
The police only suspected my brother

1217
01:48:10.726 --> 01:48:13.101
We thought we would
find a good wife for him


1218
01:48:13.893 --> 01:48:16.601
Which girl puts a condition on
killing people before their wedding?


1219
01:48:17.101 --> 01:48:19.185
The conditions must be
conveyed before the wedding,


1220
01:48:20.560 --> 01:48:22.393
bringing it up later
would lead to betrayal


1221
01:48:26.143 --> 01:48:27.601
A story came to my mind,

1222
01:48:28.643 --> 01:48:29.601
listen carefully

1223
01:48:30.518 --> 01:48:31.518
There is a girl

1224
01:48:32.810 --> 01:48:35.060
A man promises to marry her

1225
01:48:40.101 --> 01:48:44.435
One day, he and
his friend raped her


1226
01:48:53.393 --> 01:48:55.935
They record videos and
upload them to social media


1227
01:48:57.310 --> 01:48:59.060
Are you talking about
Jaggi and Rana?


1228
01:49:00.643 --> 01:49:02.101
There is one more man

1229
01:49:34.143 --> 01:49:35.518
Mousers are like animals

1230
01:49:36.268 --> 01:49:38.560
Someone will definitely
kill him someday


1231
01:49:39.101 --> 01:49:41.976
I have suffered a lot with him
since the first day of my marriage


1232
01:49:43.810 --> 01:49:46.435
Do you know why I hid
this from my brother?


1233
01:49:47.268 --> 01:49:51.851
Because I know that once
Arjan finds out, he'll kill Mouser


1234
01:49:53.018 --> 01:49:56.268
I don't want Arjan to end
up in prison for killing Mouser


1235
01:49:58.768 --> 01:50:01.060
The girl's experience was unfair

1236
01:50:02.518 --> 01:50:05.018
However, there is an
alternative way to take revenge


1237
01:50:06.310 --> 01:50:07.768
You involved my brother

1238
01:50:09.601 --> 01:50:12.726
Perhaps this illustrates the
difference between sisters and lovers


1239
01:50:41.476 --> 01:50:42.643
May God bless you, son

1240
01:50:43.560 --> 01:50:46.101
May children like you be
blessed by God for everything


1241
01:50:48.018 --> 01:50:49.810
You saved my house

1242
01:50:50.768 --> 01:50:52.643
Let me know if you
need further help


1243
01:50:52.935 --> 01:50:56.810
I patiently await
another favorable event


1244
01:51:00.601 --> 01:51:03.226
The good guys had
killed those two bastards


1245
01:51:03.768 --> 01:51:06.810
Now, only Darbara's son remains

1246
01:51:07.893 --> 01:51:09.018
He won't run away

1247
01:51:10.143 --> 01:51:12.310
Mrs. Deep fought bravely

1248
01:51:13.185 --> 01:51:16.351
He pursued justice through
police stations and courts


1249
01:51:17.185 --> 01:51:18.768
but no one listened to us

1250
01:51:20.060 --> 01:51:22.351
A man may hold an important
position in government


1251
01:51:23.310 --> 01:51:25.018
but no one surpasses God

1252
01:51:25.810 --> 01:51:27.018
May god bless you

1253
01:51:27.893 --> 01:51:28.935
Be happy

1254
01:51:31.268 --> 01:51:33.476
I want to kill two men

1255
01:51:34.685 --> 01:51:36.185
You will kill the first person

1256
01:51:37.435 --> 01:51:39.268
The second one we will kill together

1257
01:51:43.601 --> 01:51:44.560
What is the problem?

1258
01:51:45.935 --> 01:51:47.143
There are three people, not two

1259
01:51:51.560 --> 01:51:53.185
He knows how to maintain relationships

1260
01:51:53.976 --> 01:51:56.185
That's why he was the one
who would kill the third person


1261
01:51:56.726 --> 01:51:58.268
But who is the third person?

1262
01:52:05.101 --> 01:52:08.768
The killer is in front of
you but we can't see him


1263
01:52:11.976 --> 01:52:13.893
Jaggi was shot with this gun

1264
01:52:22.143 --> 01:52:23.810
Why are you crying?

1265
01:52:25.476 --> 01:52:27.518
It's not time to cry yet

1266
01:52:45.143 --> 01:52:46.935
The toilet in the palace is clogged

1267
01:52:47.851 --> 01:52:49.060
We found a gun there

1268
01:52:49.643 --> 01:52:54.018
I'm sure the killer intended
to use this gun to kill Jaggi


1269
01:52:55.268 --> 01:52:56.768
But it stuck

1270
01:53:07.101 --> 01:53:09.101
That's why he took
your friend's gun


1271
01:53:09.476 --> 01:53:11.101
and kills Jaggi

1272
01:53:16.393 --> 01:53:17.768
Not like that

1273
01:53:18.101 --> 01:53:21.310
My father was sick, so I came
to give him a sign of good luck


1274
01:53:22.226 --> 01:53:23.226
Then leave

1275
01:53:23.810 --> 01:53:24.768
I'll give it to you later

1276
01:53:28.476 --> 01:53:30.685
Why did he kill him?

1277
01:53:32.976 --> 01:53:34.268
Brother, Nimmi called

1278
01:53:34.518 --> 01:53:35.768
He met a girl at the mall

1279
01:53:35.851 --> 01:53:38.685
And he told her not to marry
because they would kill her husband


1280
01:53:39.435 --> 01:53:40.476
Look at this photo

1281
01:53:41.268 --> 01:53:42.393
Do you know him?

1282
01:53:50.435 --> 01:53:52.351
The killer was clearly
a professional shooter


1283
01:54:05.143 --> 01:54:07.268
Delete Mehar's video

1284
01:54:07.685 --> 01:54:10.018
If not, I will file a
lawsuit against you


1285
01:54:19.810 --> 01:54:20.935
Damn!

1286
01:54:21.018 --> 01:54:24.018
The killer is in front of
you but we can't see him


1287
01:54:27.476 --> 01:54:30.185
The killer is in front of you

1288
01:55:03.601 --> 01:55:05.726
Brother-in-law, let me ask you something

1289
01:55:06.560 --> 01:55:08.476
What did you say to him

1290
01:55:09.101 --> 01:55:11.601
so that he turns from
a puppy into a lion?


1291
01:55:12.935 --> 01:55:14.768
And he hurt my brother's ego

1292
01:55:15.310 --> 01:55:19.935
Sister, provoking someone
against another is not a good thing


1293
01:55:21.185 --> 01:55:23.310
He was incapable of doing this

1294
01:55:27.435 --> 01:55:30.476
This is the call.
He will die soon


1295
01:55:35.601 --> 01:55:37.101
It was three people, not two

1296
01:55:38.851 --> 01:55:40.143
You didn't tell me

1297
01:55:40.893 --> 01:55:41.893
but I know

1298
01:55:42.518 --> 01:55:44.351
Correct answer!

1299
01:55:47.476 --> 01:55:50.935
The winner gets a baby toy

1300
01:55:52.685 --> 01:55:55.851
You could have played the
drums, but you were too late


1301
01:55:57.060 --> 01:55:59.685
Brother-in-law found
out everything last night


1302
01:56:00.351 --> 01:56:01.810
If you already know

1303
01:56:02.601 --> 01:56:04.726
You should come directly to me

1304
01:56:06.101 --> 01:56:07.393
Why did you bring that
girl into this trouble?


1305
01:56:09.476 --> 01:56:12.351
I don't think it's funny without a girl

1306
01:56:13.435 --> 01:56:16.143
You did all this because of your girl

1307
01:56:16.601 --> 01:56:18.893
If not, what problem do you
have with Rana and Jaggi?


1308
01:56:20.976 --> 01:56:24.018
I'll take your girl to
the forest.  Come there


1309
01:56:24.601 --> 01:56:28.976
Seeing a girl alone in the
woods makes me excited


1310
01:56:44.601 --> 01:56:45.810
The meat is ready

1311
01:56:46.851 --> 01:56:48.101
But he still hasn't come

1312
01:56:49.560 --> 01:56:53.351
Ma'am, how many BANDS
do I need to go to Qatar?


1313
01:56:53.893 --> 01:56:55.393
Learn the alphabet first

1314
01:56:55.893 --> 01:56:57.351
Dreaming of going to Qatar

1315
01:56:58.060 --> 01:57:02.518
Sister, I don't think he loves you

1316
01:57:02.976 --> 01:57:04.518
Brother has no heart

1317
01:57:04.935 --> 01:57:08.143
If he really loved you, he
would have come by now


1318
01:57:08.226 --> 01:57:11.726
Here I come.  Don't
miss the bad times


1319
01:57:13.351 --> 01:57:14.560
It could come at any time

1320
01:57:30.643 --> 01:57:33.018
It's me, do whatever you want

1321
01:57:37.518 --> 01:57:38.726
I will pour oil for you

1322
01:57:40.518 --> 01:57:42.393
and even light a lamp in your chest

1323
01:57:49.351 --> 01:57:53.060
This is the same
alcohol you offered Rana


1324
01:58:11.685 --> 01:58:13.810
It seems like you told your
family about your funeral rituals


1325
01:58:24.393 --> 01:58:25.685
Be careful

1326
01:58:26.643 --> 01:58:28.226
The blow was very strong

1327
01:58:28.976 --> 01:58:30.226
Don't shoot anyone

1328
01:58:32.185 --> 01:58:33.351
The real game starts now

1329
02:02:35.643 --> 02:02:36.976
If someone does something,

1330
02:02:38.893 --> 02:02:40.768
then he will kill the girl

1331
02:03:39.768 --> 02:03:42.143
Your eyes will be the
reason for your death


1332
02:03:44.310 --> 02:03:47.435
If you leave the police
station with just a gun


1333
02:03:48.560 --> 02:03:49.851
Then I'll forget about it

1334
02:03:50.018 --> 02:03:52.976
Damn, you're trying to act smart

1335
02:03:53.351 --> 02:03:54.851
You show me your eyes

1336
02:03:58.393 --> 02:04:00.185
It hurt my ego

1337
02:04:02.185 --> 02:04:06.435
If I wanted, I could gouge your
eyes out right then and there


1338
02:04:07.143 --> 02:04:07.976
But not

1339
02:04:08.810 --> 02:04:11.268
I won't be satisfied with that

1340
02:04:13.018 --> 02:04:14.185
What do I do?

1341
02:04:16.518 --> 02:04:18.810
I married your sister

1342
02:04:20.143 --> 02:04:23.393
I thought with this, you would
respect me and lower your gaze


1343
02:04:24.726 --> 02:04:26.726
But you didn't do that

1344
02:04:27.226 --> 02:04:28.768
Then avenge your eyes

1345
02:04:29.560 --> 02:04:32.185
I took it out on your sister

1346
02:04:34.018 --> 02:04:35.768
He cried loudly

1347
02:04:36.893 --> 02:04:39.726
He cried and screamed loudly

1348
02:04:39.810 --> 02:04:42.643
but you didn't hear his screams

1349
02:04:43.768 --> 02:04:46.018
You're embarrassing as a brother

1350
02:04:47.685 --> 02:04:48.685
Bastard!

1351
02:04:51.060 --> 02:04:53.393
When she screams

1352
02:04:53.518 --> 02:04:57.601
I find satisfaction

1353
02:04:58.185 --> 02:04:59.310
Satisfaction!

1354
02:05:01.393 --> 02:05:02.393
His hands

1355
02:05:03.851 --> 02:05:06.435
When I put his hand in the fire

1356
02:05:07.185 --> 02:05:08.893
he screams your name

1357
02:05:09.935 --> 02:05:11.768
You!

1358
02:05:12.351 --> 02:05:13.851
You!

1359
02:05:14.601 --> 02:05:16.393
You!

1360
02:05:18.518 --> 02:05:20.101
You!

1361
02:05:28.143 --> 02:05:29.268
Lower your eyes!

1362
02:05:30.435 --> 02:05:32.810
Lower your eyes, bastard!

1363
02:05:34.935 --> 02:05:36.268
I made a mistake that day

1364
02:05:36.560 --> 02:05:39.143
and I will not repeat
the same mistake again


1365
02:06:12.018 --> 02:06:13.226
do not move

1366
02:07:01.351 --> 02:07:02.435
Shoot

1367
02:07:07.101 --> 02:07:08.143
Shoot!

1368
02:07:47.643 --> 02:07:49.393
My silence is the

1369
02:07:49.476 --> 02:07:51.185
reason you are still alive

1370
02:07:51.226 --> 02:07:52.976
The reason for my silence is my sister

1371
02:07:53.601 --> 02:07:58.101
If he told me earlier, then you
wouldn't have to tell me today


1372
02:07:59.726 --> 02:08:01.810
You would be dead by now

1373
02:08:03.393 --> 02:08:06.976
It's called 'pride',
not 'arrogance'


1374
02:08:07.768 --> 02:08:09.476
With which hand did you hurt my sister?

1375
02:08:10.226 --> 02:08:11.351
With this hand?

1376
02:08:11.476 --> 02:08:12.643
With this hand?

1377
02:08:12.935 --> 02:08:14.268
With this hand?

1378
02:08:14.768 --> 02:08:16.643
You burned his hand with this hand

1379
02:08:16.976 --> 02:08:19.518
Do you remember that poor girl?
Poor girl from IELTS?


1380
02:08:19.893 --> 02:08:21.101
Poor girl

1381
02:08:21.393 --> 02:08:25.601
Bastard, you touched
him with this hand of yours!


1382
02:08:25.643 --> 02:08:27.810
With these dirty hands!

1383
02:08:50.101 --> 02:08:52.518
Shoot him!  Get your revenge

1384
02:08:54.685 --> 02:08:56.435
We don't have to kill him

1385
02:08:57.476 --> 02:08:59.143
I don't want people to say,

1386
02:08:59.310 --> 02:09:02.476
<i>Sister's love is lost because of a lover</i>

1387
02:09:03.268 --> 02:09:05.226
Don't think, shoot him

1388
02:09:05.393 --> 02:09:07.435
You forgot Mehar.  Shoot him

1389
02:09:09.435 --> 02:09:11.893
- Shoot him
- Finish this


1390
02:09:18.268 --> 02:09:22.060
This was the difference
between inheritance and true blood


1391
02:09:22.643 --> 02:09:25.976
We do not ask permission
from women for any work


1392
02:10:19.060 --> 02:10:21.268
What if I get killed while
trying to kill that person?


1393
02:10:22.393 --> 02:10:23.810
Or if I'm in prison?

1394
02:10:26.726 --> 02:10:28.351
What will happen to us?

1395
02:10:29.601 --> 02:10:31.060
I like guns

1396
02:10:32.310 --> 02:10:33.351
I will not betray you

1397
02:10:35.851 --> 02:10:38.435
Listen, Deep's mother

1398
02:10:39.060 --> 02:10:40.351
Listen to the newspaper headlines

1399
02:10:41.810 --> 02:10:43.268
Asle Wale Sardar's son has

1400
02:10:43.351 --> 02:10:45.185
been jailed for 20
years for murder


1401
02:10:48.101 --> 02:10:51.476
It's a good thing he refused that day,
otherwise we would have been in trouble


1402
02:10:59.810 --> 02:11:01.185
Where do you go?

1403
02:11:02.101 --> 02:11:04.643
Deep, please listen to me

1404
02:11:05.476 --> 02:11:06.310
Deep!

1405
02:13:19.643 --> 02:13:21.851
See you, take care

1406
02:13:42.643 --> 02:13:44.060
He endured his son's pain,

1407
02:13:45.018 --> 02:13:47.143
but he couldn't bear
his grandson's pain


1408
02:14:11.935 --> 02:14:14.060
I want to wait for Arjan here

1409
02:14:15.185 --> 02:14:16.226
Can I stay here?

1410
02:14:20.976 --> 02:14:23.435
The pain of loss can
be endured if he dies


1411
02:14:24.976 --> 02:14:27.185
But waiting for a
prisoner is very difficult


1412
02:14:28.810 --> 02:14:30.893
A woman is incomplete
without a man


1413
02:14:31.560 --> 02:14:33.435
The wait will make you lifeless

1414
02:14:38.851 --> 02:14:41.060
Waiting for someone like
Arjan is not a death experience,


1415
02:14:42.060 --> 02:14:43.310
but rather an occasion to celebrate

1416
02:14:46.101 --> 02:14:48.810
I want to celebrate
this occasion with you


1417
02:14:51.560 --> 02:14:52.601
Will you let me celebrate?

1418
02:16:13.101 --> 02:16:15.851
Guns are our saints

1419
02:16:16.143 --> 02:16:19.018
Master gave us this
weapon as an inheritance


1420
02:16:20.101 --> 02:16:22.060
with great responsibility

1421
02:16:24.060 --> 02:16:26.268
Every time you
use a sword in battle


1422
02:16:27.643 --> 02:16:29.810
it must be used to eliminate evil

1423
02:16:31.060 --> 02:16:33.268
Not to impose
oppression on others


1424
02:16:35.351 --> 02:16:38.185
The use of weapons
must have a valid reason


1425
02:16:39.476 --> 02:16:42.893
Using weapons to
oppress others is a sinful act


1426
02:16:44.476 --> 02:16:48.351
And only through the use of
weapons can oppression be ended


1427
02:16:59.893 --> 02:17:02.226
I remember another
lesson from my grandfather


1428
02:17:03.310 --> 02:17:04.476
He once said,

1429
02:17:05.643 --> 02:17:08.685
there is no difference between
men and women in any job


1430
02:17:09.518 --> 02:17:11.393
It all depends on
how the job is handled


1431
02:17:11.976 --> 02:17:16.518
If he understands it then he can
take care of the kitchen and house too


1432
02:17:26.101 --> 02:17:27.643
He was right in saying that

1433
02:17:28.726 --> 02:17:31.018
And my words are also true

1434
02:17:31.810 --> 02:17:34.310
Gun House is not just a
business.  This is our heritage


1435
02:17:35.310 --> 02:17:38.185
That legacy was given
to everyone by our Master


1436
02:17:39.226 --> 02:17:41.351
Something that cannot be ended

1437
02:17:41.476 --> 02:17:43.351
by humans, prison or even death

1438
02:17:45.018 --> 02:17:48.601
This will continue in future
generations, like gunpowder


1439
02:17:52.726 --> 02:17:55.351
Whenever there is
oppression on this earth,


1440
02:17:58.310 --> 02:18:01.601
then here the new generation
will plant a weapon tree


1441
02:18:02.893 --> 02:18:08.893
The plant will represent righteousness
like a 'Tufang' before sinners,


1442
02:18:13.143 --> 02:18:14.018
Ginde!

1443
02:18:15.476 --> 02:18:16.143
Yes

1444
02:18:17.018 --> 02:18:19.060
Naughty India and Chanchal America

1445
02:18:19.310 --> 02:18:21.268
Keep going?  Do your job

1446
02:18:23.060 --> 02:18:24.185
Do you know Mehar?

1447
02:18:26.060 --> 02:18:29.976
Hello Ginde, Naughty India

1448
02:18:30.476 --> 02:18:31.601
Upload videos on both sites

1449
