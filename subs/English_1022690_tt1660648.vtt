1
00:00:33.688 --> 00:00:36.271
What are you?
A dog or a cow?


2
00:00:36.271 --> 00:00:38.605
I'm a dog, but not just a dog.

3
00:00:38.605 --> 00:00:41.021
I'm a dog with a boner.
Check it out!


4
00:00:44.063 --> 00:00:47.521
Well, there it is.
Is the poop ready?


5
00:00:47.521 --> 00:00:49.438
That's a roger on the poop.

6
00:00:49.938 --> 00:00:51.938
Oh, holy crap,
how big was that dog?


7
00:00:51.938 --> 00:00:53.813
Small, but there was
seven of them.


8
00:00:55.646 --> 00:00:58.313
I'll give you three reasons
why this is a bad idea.


9
00:00:58.313 --> 00:01:00.438
One, cops. Two, dogs.

10
00:01:00.438 --> 00:01:02.938
Three, NRA front door.

11
00:01:02.938 --> 00:01:05.188
Quit worrying, Dean.
These people deserve it.


12
00:01:05.188 --> 00:01:07.188
They never give out candy.

13
00:01:07.188 --> 00:01:09.521
Yeah, but remember last time
we pulled something like this?


14
00:01:09.521 --> 00:01:11.105
Dean got his arm broke.

15
00:01:11.105 --> 00:01:13.521
That's because he ran off alone
and fell in a ditch.


16
00:01:13.521 --> 00:01:15.271
If he just sticks with us,
he'll be fine.


17
00:01:15.271 --> 00:01:18.021
Come on! Let's do this.

18
00:01:18.646 --> 00:01:20.188
Okay...

19
00:01:33.105 --> 00:01:35.188
- Go!

20
00:01:48.646 --> 00:01:50.563
Ahh, uh-oh...

21
00:01:50.563 --> 00:01:52.605
It's getting kinda big-ish.

22
00:01:54.563 --> 00:01:56.646
- Come on!
- Quick!


23
00:02:05.063 --> 00:02:06.063
No!

24
00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:11.563
Doo-doo in mouth!
Doo-doo in mouth!


25
00:02:11.563 --> 00:02:12.646
Let's get out of here!

26
00:02:12.646 --> 00:02:14.521
We can't -
there's people in there!


27
00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:19.855
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!


28
00:02:19.855 --> 00:02:21.396
The scarecrow set
your house on fire.


29
00:02:23.313 --> 00:02:25.646
No one's home.
We gotta call 911!


30
00:02:25.646 --> 00:02:28.646
Dude! You're seriously
overreacting.


31
00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.646
Call 911!

32
00:02:32.646 --> 00:02:35.605
Hey, look!
They do give out candy.


33
00:02:36.605 --> 00:02:37.855
We're so dead!

34
00:02:37.855 --> 00:02:40.188
Oh, my God!
My father's going to kill me.


35
00:02:40.188 --> 00:02:42.605
Come on, let's go.
Let's get out of here.


36
00:02:42.605 --> 00:02:45.313
Wait! Wait a second,
I got an idea.


37
00:02:48.771 --> 00:02:50.855
- Who's got a pen?
- Use Wes's dick!


38
00:02:50.855 --> 00:02:52.896
Quick! Give me a first name.

39
00:02:52.896 --> 00:02:54.021
Zeus!

40
00:02:54.021 --> 00:02:55.063
A kid's name!

41
00:02:55.063 --> 00:02:56.938
- Ricky!
- Okay.


42
00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.188
Now a last name.

43
00:02:59.188 --> 00:03:00.313
I got it! Stanton.

44
00:03:02.521 --> 00:03:04.271
Wait, no! What?
That's my last name.


45
00:03:04.271 --> 00:03:06.730
So? Your first name's
not Ricky.


46
00:03:09.605 --> 00:03:11.146
- Come on.
- Come on.


47
00:03:11.855 --> 00:03:13.521
Go!

48
00:03:21.563 --> 00:03:22.896
Check this out.

49
00:03:22.896 --> 00:03:25.813
Numb-nuts kid caught his jacket
on fire during his prank.


50
00:03:25.813 --> 00:03:26.896
Here's the best part.

51
00:03:26.896 --> 00:03:28.688
His mommy
wrote his name on the collar.


52
00:03:29.188 --> 00:03:31.688
'Ricky Stanicky'?

53
00:03:31.688 --> 00:03:32.896
Dumb shit.

54
00:03:32.896 --> 00:03:34.438
Bad news, Chief.
Just heard back.


55
00:03:34.438 --> 00:03:36.313
No Stanickys
in the school district.


56
00:03:36.313 --> 00:03:37.896
Kid must be from out of town.

57
00:03:37.896 --> 00:03:39.021
Shit.

58
00:03:40.646 --> 00:03:43.355
I can't believe
that actually worked.


59
00:03:43.355 --> 00:03:47.855

made a friend for life.

Want to grab a quick drink?

70
00:05:03.896 --> 00:05:05.855
Why would you
have a quick drink...


71
00:05:07.396 --> 00:05:09.480
...when you
can have the long drink?


72
00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.563
In Finland,
the happiest country on Earth,


73
00:05:11.563 --> 00:05:13.521
we invented the long drink...

74
00:05:13.521 --> 00:05:15.355
That's it for the beer
in the garage.


75
00:05:15.355 --> 00:05:17.146
Do we need to run out
and get more?


76
00:05:17.146 --> 00:05:18.730
No. That's perfect.

77
00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:20.105
You sure?

78
00:05:20.896 --> 00:05:23.188
- Yeah. The place looks amazing.
- Yeah?


79
00:05:23.188 --> 00:05:24.855
Maybe this would be
a good side hustle for us.


80
00:05:25.896 --> 00:05:27.730
Erin and Dean's baby showers.

81
00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:29.480
- I like it.
- Yeah.


82
00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.188
And that's when
Gilbert Gines realized


83
00:05:31.188 --> 00:05:33.438
that the answer
to gang violence


84
00:05:33.438 --> 00:05:36.938
may be found in the spit-valve
of a well-worn trumpet.


85
00:05:36.938 --> 00:05:38.063
What is this?

86
00:05:38.063 --> 00:05:39.855
Uh, it's a show called
'Hero of the Week'.


87
00:05:39.855 --> 00:05:42.646
It's about everyday people
who do these incredible things.


88
00:05:42.646 --> 00:05:44.855
My producer at Channel 6
wants me to submit for it.


89
00:05:44.855 --> 00:05:46.563
He says he has
a good contact there.


90
00:05:46.563 --> 00:05:47.813
Well, what are you waiting for?

91
00:05:47.813 --> 00:05:50.188
Well, if I want MFMBC
to notice me,


92
00:05:50.188 --> 00:05:52.105
what I need are
better assignments,


93
00:05:52.105 --> 00:05:55.355
but all I get are these
babies-who-Tweet stories.


94
00:05:55.938 --> 00:05:56.938
Mm!

95
00:05:56.938 --> 00:05:58.230
Speaking of babies,

96
00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:01.021
can you please hang these
pictures up for me, over there.


97
00:06:01.021 --> 00:06:02.855
It's JT and Susan's
baby pictures.


98
00:06:03.771 --> 00:06:07.105
Jesus, God! Was JT
born with adult teeth?


99
00:06:07.105 --> 00:06:09.896
Oh, come on, his teeth
are cute. Look at that.


100
00:06:09.896 --> 00:06:12.521
Cute? He looks like
hillbilly Hitler.


101
00:06:13.605 --> 00:06:15.896
- You think all babies are cute.
- All babies are cute.


102
00:06:15.896 --> 00:06:17.646
Yeah, sure.

103
00:06:17.646 --> 00:06:19.938
And the remotes are
sticky for like 20 years.


104
00:06:19.938 --> 00:06:21.188
Well, there are good things

105
00:06:21.188 --> 00:06:22.521
about having kids too,
you know.


106
00:06:22.521 --> 00:06:24.313
- Really?
- Yeah.


107
00:06:24.313 --> 00:06:26.605
I don't remember my parents
feeling that way.


108
00:06:27.355 --> 00:06:29.646
You don't think your parents
enjoyed having kids?


109
00:06:30.355 --> 00:06:32.771
It doesn't matter.
What we have is way better.


110
00:06:32.771 --> 00:06:34.271
It's what we always
talked about.


111
00:06:34.271 --> 00:06:35.271
Hmm.

112
00:06:35.855 --> 00:06:37.146
I love you.

113
00:06:38.021 --> 00:06:39.105
You love me.

114
00:06:39.605 --> 00:06:42.021
- We love Paul.
- Hmm.


115
00:06:43.355 --> 00:06:45.271
- And we don't need anyone else.

116
00:06:45.271 --> 00:06:47.438
Oh, my God!
JT, leave me alone!


117
00:06:47.438 --> 00:06:50.646
It is my baby shower, I'm going
to have one drink. One!


118
00:06:50.646 --> 00:06:52.563
Dr. Kurihara said
it is perfectly fine. Hello.


119
00:06:52.563 --> 00:06:55.146
Dr. Kurihara is part of
the medical industrial complex,


120
00:06:55.146 --> 00:06:57.355
and Midwife Maggie said
you're on a strict vegan diet


121
00:06:57.355 --> 00:06:59.021
and absolutely no alcohol.

122
00:06:59.021 --> 00:07:01.896
Okay, well you are not Midwife
Maggie, you are my husband.


123
00:07:01.896 --> 00:07:04.188
Yeah, I know,
but I'm also Daddy Doula.


124
00:07:04.188 --> 00:07:05.855
- That's my job.
- You gotta stop saying that.


125
00:07:05.855 --> 00:07:07.355
You're going to make
the baby throw up.


126
00:07:07.355 --> 00:07:09.271
They can't... Can they
throw up inside of there?


127
00:07:09.271 --> 00:07:10.730
Wait, JT's your doula?

128
00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:13.146
Yeah, he also wants to be naked
when the baby is born.


129
00:07:13.146 --> 00:07:14.855
- Don't you?
- I don't want to be naked.


130
00:07:14.855 --> 00:07:16.396
I just want my shirt off, okay,

131
00:07:16.396 --> 00:07:18.188
for the first embrace,
skin to skin.


132
00:07:18.188 --> 00:07:20.063
- It's a bonding thing.

133
00:07:20.063 --> 00:07:21.521
- Good.
- Hey, you better get that.


134
00:07:21.521 --> 00:07:23.438
That's the fourth time Ricky
called in, like, 20 minutes.


135
00:07:23.438 --> 00:07:24.521
Yeah, see what he wants, man.

136
00:07:24.521 --> 00:07:25.730
He's been blowing me up
all day.


137
00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:27.563
- Really?
-  Yeah.


138
00:07:27.563 --> 00:07:28.980
All right.

139
00:07:29.855 --> 00:07:32.313
Stanicky! What up, man?
How's it going?


140
00:07:32.313 --> 00:07:34.438
I'm going to get you
a tea, not wine, don't drink.


141
00:07:34.438 --> 00:07:37.521
Yeah, hey I'm in the middle of
something right now. I just...


142
00:07:40.438 --> 00:07:41.771
Are you serious?

143
00:07:43.855 --> 00:07:46.313
Uh-huh. Okay.

144
00:07:48.896 --> 00:07:51.271
Well, just do me a favor
and have someone call me


145
00:07:51.271 --> 00:07:53.063
when you get out
of surgery, all right?


146
00:07:56.021 --> 00:07:57.521
So you're all alone?

147
00:07:58.646 --> 00:08:00.355
Shit, man, that sucks.

148
00:08:00.855 --> 00:08:01.938
All right, hang in there.

149
00:08:01.938 --> 00:08:03.521
We'll all be sending you
positive vibes


150
00:08:03.521 --> 00:08:05.063
from over here, buddy.

151
00:08:07.105 --> 00:08:08.355
Love you too, man.

152
00:08:09.146 --> 00:08:11.188
What's going on?
What did he say?


153
00:08:12.188 --> 00:08:13.646
It's back.

154
00:08:14.146 --> 00:08:15.146
What's back?

155
00:08:15.646 --> 00:08:18.105
- The cancer.
- Oh, God.


156
00:08:18.105 --> 00:08:19.896
I thought he was
out of the woods.


157
00:08:19.896 --> 00:08:20.938
Poor guy.

158
00:08:21.896 --> 00:08:23.980
Are they going to
have to remove the...


159
00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:25.605
...other testicle?

160
00:08:25.605 --> 00:08:27.188
And can they even do that?

161
00:08:27.188 --> 00:08:28.938
I thought you needed
at least one to live.


162
00:08:28.938 --> 00:08:30.980
What? No!
That's kidneys, dumbo.


163
00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:32.688
Where is he?

164
00:08:32.688 --> 00:08:34.438
He's in a hospital in Albany.

165
00:08:34.438 --> 00:08:36.438
Albany? Why is he in Albany?

166
00:08:36.438 --> 00:08:38.688
He flew in from Nairobi
to meet with some non-profits


167
00:08:38.688 --> 00:08:40.855
and he had an attack.

168
00:08:40.855 --> 00:08:42.480
They're gonna
open him up tonight.


169
00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.063
Dean, you should
drive out there.


170
00:08:44.063 --> 00:08:45.230
The poor guy's all alone.

171
00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:47.313
I can't go tonight.
What about the baby shower?


172
00:08:47.313 --> 00:08:48.896
And Summerhayes
is going to be here.


173
00:08:48.896 --> 00:08:50.438
What? You're worried
about your boss?


174
00:08:50.438 --> 00:08:51.730
Come on, he's just business.

175
00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:53.855
Ricky's been there for you guys
your whole lives.


176
00:08:53.855 --> 00:08:56.146
Dude, just go.
I've got Summerhayes covered.


177
00:08:56.146 --> 00:08:58.063
What? No, no, no, no.

178
00:08:58.063 --> 00:08:59.146
You should call him

179
00:08:59.146 --> 00:09:00.813
and tell him you have
a family emergency.


180
00:09:00.813 --> 00:09:02.063
You should go with Dean.

181
00:09:02.063 --> 00:09:04.480
Are you serious? Babe,
we can't both bail on the boss.


182
00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:05.938
Yes! Yes, you can.

183
00:09:05.938 --> 00:09:07.438
I mean, he'll probably
be relieved


184
00:09:07.438 --> 00:09:09.355
that he doesn't have to
go to a baby shower.


185
00:09:11.521 --> 00:09:14.813
Well, looks like
we're going to Albany.


186
00:09:14.813 --> 00:09:15.855
You were right, man -

187
00:09:15.855 --> 00:09:17.896
the Summerhayes thing
totally put it over the top.


188
00:09:17.896 --> 00:09:19.563
The Devil's in the details,
my friend.


189
00:09:19.563 --> 00:09:21.021
What the hell
took y'all so long?


190
00:09:21.021 --> 00:09:22.730
- The flight leaves in an hour.
- Oh, sorry.


191
00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:23.938
We were doing all the work

192
00:09:23.938 --> 00:09:25.980
executing our brilliant
last-minute plan.


193
00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:27.188
Who made the Stanicky calls?

194
00:09:27.188 --> 00:09:29.146
Who cares who did what, Wes?
The point is it worked.


195
00:09:29.146 --> 00:09:30.480
We got out of a baby shower,

196
00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:32.146
and we got tickets
to Marc-fucking-Rebillet!


197
00:09:32.146 --> 00:09:33.146
- Whoo!

198
00:09:33.146 --> 00:09:35.230
- How'd you score those babies?
- Yeah, this guy we work with


199
00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:36.646
broke one of his ankles
last night.


200
00:09:36.646 --> 00:09:39.188
He fell out of a tree trying
to get his kid's balloon.


201
00:09:39.188 --> 00:09:40.771
- Poor guy.
- So we got his tickets.


202
00:09:40.771 --> 00:09:42.313
Goddamn, y'all so lucky, man!

203
00:09:42.313 --> 00:09:44.063
This kind of shit
happens to you all the time.


204
00:09:44.063 --> 00:09:46.230
Hey! Good things happen
to good people.


205
00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:48.396
That's right.
Atlantic City, here we come.


206
00:09:48.396 --> 00:09:49.605
Let's tear New Jersey
a new armpit!


207
00:09:49.605 --> 00:09:50.605
Whoa!

208
00:09:51.896 --> 00:09:53.896
It's not the same
but it feels just as good.


209
00:09:53.896 --> 00:09:56.355
I mean, you just have to have
sex on the side like a walrus.


210
00:09:56.980 --> 00:09:58.521
Won't that dent
the baby's head?


211
00:09:58.521 --> 00:10:01.355
I had a friend named Liam, and
his head got all dick-dented.


212
00:10:01.896 --> 00:10:04.980
I think maybe his mother
had a short vagina.


213
00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:06.896
Just looking out
for baby Whitaker.


214
00:10:06.896 --> 00:10:08.313
So you still going with
Whitaker, huh?


215
00:10:08.313 --> 00:10:10.105
We are!
It's a family name. All right?


216
00:10:10.105 --> 00:10:11.521
- Oh, that's nice.
-  Yeah, thank you.


217
00:10:11.521 --> 00:10:13.230
You guys know the rules.

218
00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:15.021
Phones off,
so we don't get tracked.


219
00:10:15.021 --> 00:10:16.188
- Mm-hm.
- Yep.


220
00:10:17.313 --> 00:10:18.896
- All right. Wes.
- I'm Wes.


221
00:10:18.896 --> 00:10:20.021
- Bible!
- Ooh.


222
00:10:20.563 --> 00:10:22.355
All right...

223
00:10:23.105 --> 00:10:24.605
What we got?

224
00:10:24.605 --> 00:10:26.438
- Ricky's cancer's back.
- Oh, no.


225
00:10:26.438 --> 00:10:28.521
Emergency surgery
in Albany.


226
00:10:28.521 --> 00:10:31.980
Oh, that's terrible.
Emergency surgery...


227
00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:33.771
Hey, why does it
have to be cancer?


228
00:10:33.771 --> 00:10:35.271
Like, won't everybody
get worried?


229
00:10:35.271 --> 00:10:36.563
That mean I gotta
do chemo again?


230
00:10:36.563 --> 00:10:39.855
Yeah, and that's going to take
us right into the World Series.


231
00:10:39.855 --> 00:10:41.563
- Ahh.
- Boom!


232
00:10:42.271 --> 00:10:45.355
All right, one final bit
of business before we land.


233
00:10:45.355 --> 00:10:47.605
Stanicky phone. Let's get this
Instagram out of the way.


234
00:10:47.605 --> 00:10:49.063
There we go.

235
00:10:51.313 --> 00:10:53.521
-"Life is precious."
- It is.


236
00:10:53.521 --> 00:10:55.813
-"And so is friendship."
- Hmm.


237
00:10:55.813 --> 00:10:58.480
"Thanks to my boys
for being here for me."


238
00:10:59.105 --> 00:11:00.105
Good.

239
00:11:00.105 --> 00:11:02.063
All right, are we done?
Is it get drunk time?


240
00:11:02.063 --> 00:11:03.980
- Yeah.
- A toast!


241
00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:05.355
To Ricky Stanicky.

242
00:11:05.355 --> 00:11:07.063
To Ricky Stanicky.

243
00:11:07.063 --> 00:11:09.271
The best friend we never had.

244
00:11:09.855 --> 00:11:10.980
Yoo!

245
00:11:16.855 --> 00:11:18.480
♪ Get the fuck out of bed
Bitch, go! ♪


246
00:11:22.605 --> 00:11:24.730
♪ Get up, get up!
You gotta go, gah! ♪


247
00:11:28.146 --> 00:11:29.896
♪ Wake up, time to wake up
Bitch, get up! ♪


248
00:11:51.938 --> 00:11:53.855
-  Woo-hoo-hoo!

249
00:11:53.855 --> 00:11:56.313
God, that was good!
That was amazing!


250
00:11:56.313 --> 00:11:59.105
- Thank you, Ricky Stanicky.
- The fucking Loop Daddy!


251
00:11:59.105 --> 00:12:00.271
Unbelievable, dude.

252
00:12:00.271 --> 00:12:02.480
It makes all that guilt
I'm feeling totally worthwhile.


253
00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:04.355
Why do we even
have to feel guilt?


254
00:12:04.355 --> 00:12:05.605
We could have just told them.

255
00:12:05.605 --> 00:12:07.355
You know, and cut out
that whole angst part.


256
00:12:07.355 --> 00:12:09.105
No, because
the Rebillet tickets


257
00:12:09.105 --> 00:12:10.730
fell into our lap this morning,

258
00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:12.855
and the girls have had the baby
shower planned for weeks.


259
00:12:12.855 --> 00:12:14.438
Yeah.
Yeah, but they're strong women.


260
00:12:14.438 --> 00:12:16.105
I'm sure
they would've gotten over


261
00:12:16.105 --> 00:12:17.605
us skipping one little party.

262
00:12:17.605 --> 00:12:20.938
It's not one little party.
It's my baby shower.


263
00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:23.771
Oh, a Jack and Coke.

264
00:12:23.771 --> 00:12:25.896
I'll have a Dos Equis, please.
Hoo!


265
00:12:25.896 --> 00:12:28.896
Do you have, uh...
do you have organic vodka?


266
00:12:31.021 --> 00:12:32.730
Just any vodka, it's all...

267
00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:34.230
- Anything.
- Thank you.


268
00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:36.771
Speaking of vodka,
I'll take a Belvedere, neat,


269
00:12:36.771 --> 00:12:38.355
and a plate of
your crispiest calamari.


270
00:12:38.355 --> 00:12:40.563
No, no, Rod. No! Bad!

271
00:12:40.563 --> 00:12:42.188
You keep freeloading
off the customers


272
00:12:42.188 --> 00:12:43.313
and you're out of here.

273
00:12:43.313 --> 00:12:45.105
He loves
giving me the business.


274
00:12:45.105 --> 00:12:47.313
Just to be clear,
I'm anything but a freeloader.


275
00:12:47.313 --> 00:12:49.396
Just going to give you guys
a little 'squid pro quo'


276
00:12:49.396 --> 00:12:50.896
for the calamari.

277
00:12:50.896 --> 00:12:52.605
Really? Meaning?

278
00:12:52.605 --> 00:12:54.563
Oh, I do a midnight show
at the Slot Swamp Casino.


279
00:12:54.563 --> 00:12:56.855
I'll get you guys in,
half price.


280
00:12:56.855 --> 00:12:59.146
- What kind of show?
- Ah. Check this out.


281
00:13:00.855 --> 00:13:01.855
Boom!

282
00:13:01.855 --> 00:13:03.646
Oh, shit! Yo!

283
00:13:03.646 --> 00:13:05.063
"Rock Hard Rod -

284
00:13:05.063 --> 00:13:08.313
"South Jersey's premier X-rated
rock'n'roll impersonator".


285
00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:11.605
That's not as crazy
as it sounds.


286
00:13:11.605 --> 00:13:14.230
I mean, most of the songs
are just about masturbation,


287
00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:15.563
and we all do that, right?

288
00:13:16.105 --> 00:13:17.313
Yeah!

289
00:13:17.313 --> 00:13:19.730
Actually, Rod, I don't think
we'll be able to make the show,


290
00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:20.896
but we'll buy you a drink

291
00:13:20.896 --> 00:13:22.313
if you put
your jerk-off hand down.


292
00:13:22.313 --> 00:13:23.938
You drive a hard bargain, sir.

293
00:13:23.938 --> 00:13:27.480
So, you do a bunch of jerk-off
songs to make a living?


294
00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:28.813
Yeah, I do a whole act.

295
00:13:28.813 --> 00:13:30.896
Wall-to-wall,
top-to-bottom jizz jams!


296
00:13:30.896 --> 00:13:32.980
You'll be surprised at how much
material lends itself to it.


297
00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:34.230
I mean, 'Beat It',
Michael Jackson.


298
00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:35.855
'Wind Beneath My Wings',
Bette Midler.


299
00:13:35.855 --> 00:13:37.563
- Anything by The Strokes!
- Mm.


300
00:13:37.563 --> 00:13:39.021
Yeah, and I'm the only one
in the world


301
00:13:39.021 --> 00:13:40.063
that's figured it out.

302
00:13:40.063 --> 00:13:43.230
Yeah, it's almost
hard to believe.


303
00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:44.813
Oh, Barry,
my dear friends here


304
00:13:44.813 --> 00:13:46.271
will buy me that drink
after all.


305
00:13:46.771 --> 00:13:47.980
Oh, yeah,
I also do impressions.


306
00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:50.063
You name it, I can do it.
I'm a trained actor, you know.


307
00:13:50.063 --> 00:13:51.980
- I got a good one for you, Rod.
- Yeah?


308
00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:53.980
Why don't you do the guy
that gets the fuck out of here


309
00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:55.563
before I call security?

310
00:13:55.563 --> 00:13:57.396
No, no, no, it's okay.
It's okay.


311
00:13:57.396 --> 00:13:58.521
I think we'd like to see this.

312
00:13:58.521 --> 00:14:00.105
And go ahead
and bring him that drink.


313
00:14:00.105 --> 00:14:03.438
Ha!
And the calamari, Bar-ry!


314
00:14:03.438 --> 00:14:05.605
Dickhead!
Love that guy.


315
00:14:05.605 --> 00:14:07.313
So, who do you guys
want me to do?


316
00:14:07.313 --> 00:14:09.896
You, er, I don't know,
you like Owen Wilson?


317
00:14:10.438 --> 00:14:11.938
- Sure.
- We love Owen Wilson.


318
00:14:11.938 --> 00:14:14.230
- Yeah, that's fine.
- I would love some Owen Wilson.


319
00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:19.021
Wow!

320
00:14:19.021 --> 00:14:20.896
Where in the history
of our relationship


321
00:14:20.896 --> 00:14:22.938
did you think
I couldn't do an impersonation


322
00:14:22.938 --> 00:14:24.980
of somebody as adorable
as The Big O?


323
00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:27.813
That is an excellent Owen
Wilson. That's a good Owen.


324
00:14:27.813 --> 00:14:28.938
- It's okay.
- Wow.


325
00:14:28.938 --> 00:14:30.896
-  It's not that good.
- Thank you. Oh, er...


326
00:14:30.896 --> 00:14:33.063
- I'm just...
-  Calamari's here, man.


327
00:14:36.896 --> 00:14:38.438
All right,
an oldie but a goodie.


328
00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:42.355
Take a look at this tit, kid.

329
00:14:42.355 --> 00:14:44.146
Probably the last one
you're ever going to see


330
00:14:44.146 --> 00:14:45.396
for the rest of your life.

331
00:14:45.896 --> 00:14:47.730
Don't drink no more, Momma.

332
00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:49.230
You're real mean
when you drink stuff.


333
00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:51.480
Quit your
bitchin', ya sloppy punk.


334
00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:53.146
You wanna know how
you was hatched?


335
00:14:53.146 --> 00:14:55.855
Your old man
was basting my rump roast


336
00:14:55.855 --> 00:14:57.938
and some of it dribbled
into my woolly burger.


337
00:14:57.938 --> 00:14:59.730
You know what
that makes you?


338
00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:01.730
A shit baby!

339
00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:03.730
That's right,
you're nothing but shit,


340
00:15:03.730 --> 00:15:05.396
and you always will be!

341
00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:08.438
Is... is that from
'Downton Abbey'?


342
00:15:09.646 --> 00:15:11.813
That was, er...

343
00:15:11.813 --> 00:15:14.355
just a little skit
from my childhood.


344
00:15:19.605 --> 00:15:20.646
Er, yeah...

345
00:15:20.646 --> 00:15:22.813
I think it's time
to hit the tables, boys. Huh?


346
00:15:22.813 --> 00:15:24.771
Right on. Where are we going?

347
00:15:24.771 --> 00:15:26.396
Copper Bonnet's the only place
on the boardwalk


348
00:15:26.396 --> 00:15:27.396
with 50-cent tables.

349
00:15:27.396 --> 00:15:29.271
Not as many hookers,
but they're friendlier -


350
00:15:29.271 --> 00:15:30.396
they don't get weirded out

351
00:15:30.396 --> 00:15:31.813
when you just wanna
brush their hair.


352
00:15:31.813 --> 00:15:34.021
Yeah, Rod, I think we're just
going to stay around here.


353
00:15:34.021 --> 00:15:36.521
Oh, here's great. I'm friends
with the bartender, Barry.


354
00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:41.313
Hey, Hard-on Ronnie,
we are doing our own thing.


355
00:15:41.313 --> 00:15:43.105
We got our thing going on,

356
00:15:43.105 --> 00:15:46.146
and we're probably
just gonna...


357
00:15:46.146 --> 00:15:47.938
leave you.

358
00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:54.355
Okay, I can take a hint.

359
00:15:55.355 --> 00:15:56.355
You guys look at me

360
00:15:56.355 --> 00:15:58.313
and you just see another
scumbag impersonator, right?


361
00:15:58.313 --> 00:16:01.063
Thanks for understanding, man.
You're a good dude.


362
00:16:05.313 --> 00:16:07.771
- What the hell, man?
- What?


363
00:16:07.771 --> 00:16:09.646
You didn't have to be
so mean about it.


364
00:16:10.396 --> 00:16:12.313
What? I wasn't...
What did I do?


365
00:16:13.188 --> 00:16:14.688
What? Was I being an asshole?

366
00:16:14.688 --> 00:16:16.771
Well, you called him
'Hard-on Ronnie'.


367
00:16:16.771 --> 00:16:18.646
It's 'Rock Hard Rod'.

368
00:16:18.646 --> 00:16:20.605
Ohh, right, I'm so sorry.

369
00:16:20.605 --> 00:16:22.146
I didn't know
Weird Al Wankovic


370
00:16:22.146 --> 00:16:23.813
would be so sensitive.

371
00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:27.063
Rod! Hey, Rod!

372
00:16:27.896 --> 00:16:28.896
These are mine.

373
00:16:28.896 --> 00:16:31.563
I just wanted to say sorry for
what happened back there.


374
00:16:31.563 --> 00:16:32.980
My friends...

375
00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:35.480
they just want it to be
some kind of reunion, just us,


376
00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:37.105
but that wasn't cool, so...

377
00:16:38.438 --> 00:16:40.730
Whatever, I get it.
Happens all the time.


378
00:16:41.646 --> 00:16:43.438
You guys come in to AC

379
00:16:43.438 --> 00:16:46.105
with your Toyota Avalons and
your anesthesiologist money.


380
00:16:46.105 --> 00:16:47.980
Strutting around
like a bunch of big shots.


381
00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:49.396
Let me tell you something.

382
00:16:49.396 --> 00:16:50.896
We lost Joan Rivers
and Michael Jackson


383
00:16:50.896 --> 00:16:52.271
because of you fuckers, okay?

384
00:16:52.271 --> 00:16:54.480
None of us are
anesthesiologists.


385
00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:56.980
Not here for the convention?

386
00:16:56.980 --> 00:16:58.188
No.

387
00:16:59.813 --> 00:17:01.480
Hey, I get it, man.

388
00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:04.021
You look at me and see another
asshole sideshow freak, right?


389
00:17:04.021 --> 00:17:05.688
- Not at all.
- I'm more than that.


390
00:17:05.688 --> 00:17:07.646
I'm a damn good actor.

391
00:17:08.355 --> 00:17:09.688
You'll see.

392
00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:11.480
Shit!

393
00:17:18.563 --> 00:17:20.063
Who are they?

394
00:17:20.063 --> 00:17:21.688
Crazy fans
I was trying to avoid.


395
00:17:22.271 --> 00:17:25.188
Anyway, I gotta run.
Hey, take my card.


396
00:17:27.063 --> 00:17:28.146
Remember that name.

397
00:17:28.146 --> 00:17:30.105
I promise it's going to mean
something to you some day.


398
00:17:30.105 --> 00:17:32.021
I would not be surprised.

399
00:17:42.105 --> 00:17:43.855
Oh! Jeez.

400
00:18:00.396 --> 00:18:02.896
Oh, my God! Yes! Yes!

401
00:18:04.146 --> 00:18:05.938
- Give me my money right now!
- JT! JT!


402
00:18:05.938 --> 00:18:08.188
Not now, Dean. I'm on fire!

403
00:18:08.188 --> 00:18:10.396
And for once I'm going to leave
Atlantic City a winner!


404
00:18:10.396 --> 00:18:11.980
Susan's in labor.

405
00:18:16.355 --> 00:18:18.480
This was a bad idea.
I knew this was a bad idea.


406
00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:19.688
Don't friggin' do that, man.

407
00:18:19.688 --> 00:18:21.730
You're 'Monday morning
quarterbacking' right now.


408
00:18:21.730 --> 00:18:23.813
Who could've figured she'd go
into labor six weeks early?


409
00:18:23.813 --> 00:18:27.105
Six weeks! My baby's going to
be born six weeks early.


410
00:18:27.105 --> 00:18:29.271
- Is he going to be okay?
- The baby's going to fine.


411
00:18:29.271 --> 00:18:31.480
Babies are born
six weeks early all the time.


412
00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:33.188
I was born six weeks early.

413
00:18:33.188 --> 00:18:35.230
Oh, shit! Go, go, go! Go!

414
00:18:45.146 --> 00:18:46.688
Susan Levine.
What room is she in?


415
00:18:47.646 --> 00:18:49.396
- Levine?
- Yeah, Levine.


416
00:18:49.938 --> 00:18:53.063
Ah, here we are.
She and the baby are in 208.


417
00:18:54.105 --> 00:18:55.688
She had the baby?!

418
00:18:55.688 --> 00:18:57.521
Oh, baby Whitaker.

419
00:18:58.021 --> 00:18:59.896
This was not the birth plan
I had for you.


420
00:19:00.521 --> 00:19:02.605
I wanted you born on the shores
of Goosewing Beach.


421
00:19:02.605 --> 00:19:04.313
You know what
my birth plan was?


422
00:19:04.313 --> 00:19:06.271
For you to actually be here.

423
00:19:06.271 --> 00:19:08.188
Why isn't he wearing a shirt?

424
00:19:08.188 --> 00:19:10.646
I'm having skin-to-skin
contact with my son, Leona.


425
00:19:10.646 --> 00:19:13.105
It's a proven way of regulating
a newborn baby's temperature,


426
00:19:13.105 --> 00:19:14.605
and it calms him, thank you.

427
00:19:14.605 --> 00:19:16.146
Don't blankets do that?

428
00:19:16.646 --> 00:19:19.480
Oh, he is such a little peanut.

429
00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:22.063
We should call him Shrimpy,
he's such a little peanut.


430
00:19:22.063 --> 00:19:25.063
Please don't call
my grandson 'Shrimpy'.


431
00:19:25.063 --> 00:19:27.313
Shrimps are
the cockroaches of the sea.


432
00:19:27.813 --> 00:19:30.563
6lbs is pretty good for a month
and a half early, right, Mom?


433
00:19:30.563 --> 00:19:32.688
Oh, he's perfect. He's perfect.

434
00:19:32.688 --> 00:19:35.438
I want to know where the hell
you guys were tonight.


435
00:19:35.438 --> 00:19:37.605
We called every hospital
in Albany


436
00:19:37.605 --> 00:19:40.188
and there was no record
of a Ricky Stanicky.


437
00:19:40.188 --> 00:19:41.813
Yeah, and the last thing
you tell me


438
00:19:41.813 --> 00:19:44.146
is you got to go see him
because he's got...


439
00:19:44.146 --> 00:19:45.605
What kind of cancer?

440
00:19:46.188 --> 00:19:48.396
Er... anal.

441
00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:50.605
I thought it was testicular.

442
00:19:50.605 --> 00:19:54.146
It was testicular, but then
it spread to his anus.


443
00:19:54.730 --> 00:19:56.896
Yeah, they had to remove it.

444
00:19:56.896 --> 00:19:58.188
They removed his asshole?

445
00:19:59.313 --> 00:20:02.438
Er... just the outer lip part.

446
00:20:02.438 --> 00:20:05.271
Outer lip part?
What is he, a fucking baboon?


447
00:20:05.271 --> 00:20:07.355
Come on, Wes.
What's going on here?


448
00:20:07.355 --> 00:20:08.938
Where were you?

449
00:20:12.730 --> 00:20:14.480
Okay.

450
00:20:16.396 --> 00:20:17.813
It was a lie.

451
00:20:19.105 --> 00:20:21.021
It's all been a lie.

452
00:20:21.563 --> 00:20:23.188
What's a lie?

453
00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:26.188
The whole Ricky Stanicky thing.

454
00:20:27.063 --> 00:20:29.313
It was, uh...

455
00:20:29.313 --> 00:20:30.480
It's bullshit.

456
00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:32.480
JT, what's he talking about?

457
00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:34.188
Yeah, Dean,
what is he talking about?


458
00:20:35.813 --> 00:20:37.771
He's saying...

459
00:20:37.771 --> 00:20:40.271
Ricky Stanicky lied to us.

460
00:20:40.271 --> 00:20:42.688
Okay? There was no cancer.

461
00:20:42.688 --> 00:20:44.980
When we got to the hospital,
Ricky was standing out front


462
00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:46.688
with a bottle of champagne
and a limo.


463
00:20:46.688 --> 00:20:48.730
Turns out that it was his
five-year anniversary


464
00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:50.521
being cancer free.

465
00:20:50.521 --> 00:20:53.605
So he pretended to have cancer

466
00:20:53.605 --> 00:20:56.355
just so he could celebrate
not having cancer?


467
00:20:56.355 --> 00:20:58.271
I... Yeah.

468
00:20:58.271 --> 00:20:59.396
It's typical Rick.

469
00:20:59.396 --> 00:21:01.355
You know, he's got
such a weird sense of humour.


470
00:21:01.355 --> 00:21:02.938
-  He does, yep.
-  Okay...


471
00:21:02.938 --> 00:21:05.480
He was in Albany meeting with
the Give Green Foundation,


472
00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:07.688
and I guess he just wanted
to celebrate with us.


473
00:21:07.688 --> 00:21:09.188
So he pranked us.

474
00:21:09.188 --> 00:21:11.771
The Give Green Foundation?

475
00:21:11.771 --> 00:21:14.396
Yeah. You've heard of them,
Leona. They're wonderful.


476
00:21:14.396 --> 00:21:17.980
Wait, why didn't you call us
and tell us that he was okay?


477
00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:19.771
And why was your phone off
all night?


478
00:21:19.771 --> 00:21:21.313
Oh, baby, it was a whirlwind.

479
00:21:21.313 --> 00:21:22.896
Ricky took us
to a stand-up comedy show


480
00:21:22.896 --> 00:21:24.563
and they didn't
allow cell phones, so...


481
00:21:25.105 --> 00:21:27.188
And after that,
the night turned into a blur.


482
00:21:27.188 --> 00:21:29.438
You know I wanted
to be here for you for this.


483
00:21:29.438 --> 00:21:30.980
I wanted this more
than you did.


484
00:21:31.813 --> 00:21:33.188
Oh, get that baby
off that thing


485
00:21:33.188 --> 00:21:34.313
and give him to his mother.

486
00:21:34.313 --> 00:21:35.896
Oh, that is disgusting!

487
00:21:35.896 --> 00:21:39.188
No. It's dangerous to detach.
Let him suck it out.


488
00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:42.230
Yeah. Good boy.

489
00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:43.980
This hippie-dippy crap.

490
00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:45.980
Well, I'm certainly
going to give Ricky an earful


491
00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:48.063
when I see him
at the bris next week.


492
00:21:48.063 --> 00:21:49.396
What's a bris?

493
00:21:49.396 --> 00:21:51.021
It's the circumcision ceremony.

494
00:21:51.021 --> 00:21:54.021
Oh! It sounds like a soup.

495
00:21:54.021 --> 00:21:56.438
You know, I doubt he's going to
be able to be there, sadly.


496
00:21:56.438 --> 00:21:57.521
Why not?

497
00:21:58.355 --> 00:22:00.105
He has work in Nairobi.

498
00:22:00.105 --> 00:22:01.438
No, he doesn't.

499
00:22:01.438 --> 00:22:03.188
Wes is helping him out
with some fundraiser


500
00:22:03.188 --> 00:22:04.730
in Providence
on Saturday night.


501
00:22:06.313 --> 00:22:08.605
I remember telling...
I told you.


502
00:22:09.688 --> 00:22:10.813
Yeah.

503
00:22:10.813 --> 00:22:14.813
Great. Well, the bris is on
Sunday, so he can make it.


504
00:22:14.813 --> 00:22:18.146
Yeah, maybe. Unless he's got to
fly out early on Sunday.


505
00:22:18.146 --> 00:22:19.355
Well, that's ridiculous.

506
00:22:19.355 --> 00:22:20.896
Come on,
if he's in town on Saturday,


507
00:22:20.896 --> 00:22:23.188
why wouldn't he spend an extra
day to meet baby Whitaker?


508
00:22:23.188 --> 00:22:25.313
Yeah, why wouldn't he?

509
00:22:26.188 --> 00:22:29.438
You're absolutely right.
He should stay an extra day.


510
00:22:29.438 --> 00:22:31.396
In fact, I'm going to
make sure of it.


511
00:22:32.063 --> 00:22:33.396
What the fuck, Dean?

512
00:22:33.396 --> 00:22:34.855
What did you want me
to say, man?


513
00:22:34.855 --> 00:22:36.230
They were all staring at me.

514
00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:38.896
I look at you. You've got baby
Whitaker nursing on you.


515
00:22:38.896 --> 00:22:40.396
Horrible name, by the way.

516
00:22:40.396 --> 00:22:42.230
- I just--
- You panicked.


517
00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:43.480
I panicked?!

518
00:22:44.146 --> 00:22:46.480
What are you talk...?! You're
the one who almost outed us!


519
00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:47.813
And you made plans
with Stanicky!


520
00:22:47.813 --> 00:22:50.021
Ricky Stanicky is not
a one-man show. You know that!


521
00:22:50.021 --> 00:22:51.521
It's a fragile fabric, man.

522
00:22:51.521 --> 00:22:54.105
Ricky Stanicky is only to be
used as a three-man team.


523
00:22:54.105 --> 00:22:55.105
Huh.

524
00:22:55.105 --> 00:22:56.771
So, what about
the golf rounds with Ricky


525
00:22:56.771 --> 00:22:58.230
that JT charged
to your company?


526
00:22:58.230 --> 00:22:59.438
- You weren't there.
- What?


527
00:22:59.438 --> 00:23:00.980
I charged the rounds of golf

528
00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:02.563
because you didn't
have any money.


529
00:23:02.563 --> 00:23:05.605
Seriously, Wes. What
happened in there, man?


530
00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:07.771
Look.

531
00:23:07.771 --> 00:23:10.230
Keith's been on my ass
about finding a job,


532
00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:12.480
and sleeping all day...

533
00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:14.730
and pumicing my foot-skin
over the sink.


534
00:23:14.730 --> 00:23:16.813
What the fuck does this
have to do with Stanicky?


535
00:23:16.813 --> 00:23:18.646
I needed a break!

536
00:23:18.646 --> 00:23:20.480
Keith can be very oppressive.

537
00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:22.105
Sometimes
I feel like I'm living


538
00:23:22.105 --> 00:23:23.521
in a gay 'Handmaid's Tale'.

539
00:23:24.313 --> 00:23:29.146
So I went to a pot farm, where
they make cannabis milk.


540
00:23:29.146 --> 00:23:31.146
You played the Stanicky card
to get pot milk?


541
00:23:31.146 --> 00:23:33.063
You never had milk
like this before.


542
00:23:33.063 --> 00:23:34.438
- No, I haven't.
- It's delicious.


543
00:23:34.438 --> 00:23:35.521
I hope!

544
00:23:35.521 --> 00:23:37.646
They must feed these
lucky cows weed all day,


545
00:23:37.646 --> 00:23:39.605
because when
they milk 'em - boom!


546
00:23:39.605 --> 00:23:41.271
Dream cream!

547
00:23:41.271 --> 00:23:42.605
What did you just say?

548
00:23:42.605 --> 00:23:43.730
Dream cream.

549
00:23:44.438 --> 00:23:45.563
Huh!

550
00:23:48.605 --> 00:23:51.396
We're fucked.
We're majorly fucked.


551
00:23:51.396 --> 00:23:53.105
You know, we don't
deserve this shit.


552
00:23:53.105 --> 00:23:54.521
All we did was tell one lie.

553
00:23:54.521 --> 00:23:57.063
Hundreds and hundreds of times
over many, many years.


554
00:23:58.063 --> 00:23:59.313
Hey, maybe they'll forget

555
00:23:59.313 --> 00:24:01.521
that they invited Stanicky
to the bris.


556
00:24:01.521 --> 00:24:03.646
They'll be so busy
with the family and friends,


557
00:24:03.646 --> 00:24:04.730
and cutting of penises.

558
00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:06.646
They're not going to forget
they invited him, Wes.


559
00:24:07.771 --> 00:24:09.396
I got it. My boy Jonesy.

560
00:24:09.396 --> 00:24:11.188
He works for one of
those online obituaries.


561
00:24:11.188 --> 00:24:13.063
We could kill Stanicky off.

562
00:24:13.063 --> 00:24:14.896
I like that.
Let's kill his ass.


563
00:24:14.896 --> 00:24:16.396
Put your hands down, shit nuts.

564
00:24:16.396 --> 00:24:19.896
Obituaries give details.
Friends, family, cemeteries.


565
00:24:19.896 --> 00:24:22.146
Plus then everyone's going to
want to go to the funeral.


566
00:24:22.146 --> 00:24:25.355
Okay, Dean,
your negativity is not helping.


567
00:24:27.438 --> 00:24:32.230
Or, uh, we could go do
my original plan...


568
00:24:33.146 --> 00:24:34.730
... and tell everybody
the truth.


569
00:24:34.730 --> 00:24:36.938
Shut your mouth.
Shut your stupid mouth.


570
00:24:36.938 --> 00:24:38.271
We're not telling the truth.

571
00:24:38.271 --> 00:24:39.896
There'll be no truth told, okay?

572
00:24:39.896 --> 00:24:41.688
We're going to do
the right thing here.


573
00:24:41.688 --> 00:24:43.271
Some would argue
that telling the truth


574
00:24:43.271 --> 00:24:44.480
is the right thing to do.

575
00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:45.646
Yeah - assholes!

576
00:24:45.646 --> 00:24:48.105
Let me remind you guys of
what the truth is, dream cream.


577
00:24:48.105 --> 00:24:49.563
Last night,
when I was in New Jersey


578
00:24:49.563 --> 00:24:51.730
secretly partying my face off
at the Marc Rebillet concert,


579
00:24:51.730 --> 00:24:53.146
my wife was giving birth
to my son.


580
00:24:53.146 --> 00:24:54.271
Alone! Okay?

581
00:24:54.271 --> 00:24:56.355
And if the truth does come out,
my marriage is over.


582
00:24:56.355 --> 00:24:58.396
And later, if my son finds out,
that's over too.


583
00:24:58.396 --> 00:24:59.563
Is that what you want, Wes?

584
00:24:59.563 --> 00:25:02.730
You want to destroy
an entire family, huh? Huh?


585
00:25:04.021 --> 00:25:06.271
- Huh?
- Hey, hey, hey, wait a minute.


586
00:25:06.271 --> 00:25:10.438
What if we hire an actor
to play Stanicky?


587
00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:12.563
We give him the whole run-down.

588
00:25:12.563 --> 00:25:14.230
Tell him everything
he needs to know.


589
00:25:15.730 --> 00:25:17.313
Okay, okay, I like this.
Keep going.


590
00:25:17.313 --> 00:25:19.938
We could give him
the bible, right?


591
00:25:19.938 --> 00:25:22.396
He studies it for a few days,

592
00:25:22.396 --> 00:25:24.688
and then he comes to the bris
for a couple of hours


593
00:25:24.688 --> 00:25:27.230
and he plays Ricky Stanicky.

594
00:25:28.646 --> 00:25:31.355
Okay, but where are we
going to find an actor?


595
00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:34.521
Gary Polisner! He's in
that Red Robin commercial.


596
00:25:34.521 --> 00:25:36.480
- He is?
- Yeah.


597
00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:38.730
He's that dude that goes,
"Seconds on steak fries?


598
00:25:38.730 --> 00:25:39.980
"Uh, yeah!"

599
00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:41.188
- That's Gary?
- That's Gary.


600
00:25:41.188 --> 00:25:42.771
- Good for him!
- Good for him.


601
00:25:42.771 --> 00:25:44.063
I love those commercials.

602
00:25:44.063 --> 00:25:45.563
Guys, minor wrinkle -

603
00:25:45.563 --> 00:25:48.146
Gary's dating Carly,
Erin's cousin.


604
00:25:48.146 --> 00:25:49.355
Oh, Cousin It?

605
00:25:49.355 --> 00:25:51.230
That girl with the hair
that touches the floor?


606
00:25:51.230 --> 00:25:53.063
Yeah, but don't worry.

607
00:25:53.730 --> 00:25:56.230
I know an actor
that nobody knows.

626
00:27:21.105 --> 00:27:23.188
Thanks for coming out tonight,
ladies and gentlemen.


627
00:27:23.188 --> 00:27:26.313
So horny to be here.
So horny to be here.


628
00:27:31.563 --> 00:27:32.771
Great show, Rod.

629
00:27:32.771 --> 00:27:34.521
Good crowd.

630
00:27:38.855 --> 00:27:42.063
Hey, Rod. Those guys
are out there again.


631
00:27:56.188 --> 00:27:58.063
Hey, we need
more beer mugs.


632
00:28:25.521 --> 00:28:28.521
Rod Rimestead, trained actor.
How can I help you?


633
00:28:29.605 --> 00:28:31.188
Yeah, Dean, I remember you.

634
00:28:32.855 --> 00:28:34.146
A gig?

635
00:28:35.105 --> 00:28:37.480
Let me... Er, you know what?
Let me just check my schedule.


636
00:28:43.396 --> 00:28:45.646
Yeah, man. Looks like I'm free.

637
00:28:46.271 --> 00:28:48.271
And so our feathered friend

638
00:28:48.271 --> 00:28:50.313
still has not gotten off
the golf ball


639
00:28:50.313 --> 00:28:53.105
that Dr. Dominic DiPasquale
of East Greenwich


640
00:28:53.105 --> 00:28:56.563
hit near this greenside bunker
six days ago.


641
00:28:56.563 --> 00:28:58.688
But you can count on
Channel 6 to be here


642
00:28:58.688 --> 00:29:00.855
until this exciting saga ends.

643
00:29:00.855 --> 00:29:05.355
Or, you can go to Channel6.com
and log onto our live duck-cam.


644
00:29:09.021 --> 00:29:10.980
Can you believe
I spent three years


645
00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:13.146
in journalism grad school
for this crap?


646
00:29:13.146 --> 00:29:15.271
Are you kidding?
I love this story. It's fun.


647
00:29:15.271 --> 00:29:16.771
Don't patronize me.

648
00:29:16.771 --> 00:29:19.146
Okay. It sucks.
I'm embarrassed for you.


649
00:29:19.146 --> 00:29:20.646
Thank you.

650
00:29:20.646 --> 00:29:23.438
You're really sweet to hang
out with me, though, honestly.


651
00:29:23.438 --> 00:29:24.771
- Are you kidding?
- Thank you.


652
00:29:24.771 --> 00:29:26.771
Who else gets the chance
to watch history unfold?


653
00:29:28.063 --> 00:29:29.188
Oh, wait.

654
00:29:29.188 --> 00:29:31.938
You know who's looking forward
to meeting Ricky tomorrow?


655
00:29:31.938 --> 00:29:33.730
Yeah, Leona. I know.

656
00:29:33.730 --> 00:29:35.730
Uh-uh. Carly.

657
00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:37.396
Carly with the hair?

658
00:29:37.396 --> 00:29:39.271
Mm-hm, my cousin, yeah.

659
00:29:39.271 --> 00:29:40.771
What happened to Gary Polisner?

660
00:29:40.771 --> 00:29:42.896
Oh, you know,
they're together,


661
00:29:42.896 --> 00:29:45.396
but she follows Ricky
on Instagram.


662
00:29:45.396 --> 00:29:48.313
- Loves his charity work.
- Hmm.


663
00:29:48.313 --> 00:29:50.605
That duck's not going anywhere.

664
00:29:51.438 --> 00:29:53.646
Let's go get some lunch.
Come back in an hour.


665
00:29:53.646 --> 00:29:56.355
I would, but I can't. I'm on
duck duty for four more hours.


666
00:29:56.355 --> 00:29:58.646
Unless she gets up,
I'm stuck here.


667
00:30:00.563 --> 00:30:01.855
Unless she gets up, huh.

668
00:30:03.813 --> 00:30:05.230
No! Paul!

669
00:30:06.396 --> 00:30:08.021
Paul! Paul, come back here.

670
00:30:12.646 --> 00:30:14.771
Hey, Paul.
Paul, get back here.


671
00:30:17.021 --> 00:30:18.521
- Paul!
- Oh, my God!


672
00:30:19.771 --> 00:30:21.188
Paul!

673
00:30:22.855 --> 00:30:24.063
Oh, my God!

674
00:30:24.771 --> 00:30:26.271
Come on! Paul!

675
00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:30.063
Paul! Get out of there!

676
00:30:30.063 --> 00:30:31.438
Hold your breath, Paul!

677
00:30:31.438 --> 00:30:32.855
Hang in there, buddy!

678
00:30:32.855 --> 00:30:33.980
- Bad duck!
- Ow!


679
00:30:34.896 --> 00:30:38.230
Dean, do something! You
have to pull him out of there.


680
00:30:43.396 --> 00:30:45.605
Let's take a rain check
on the lunch, all right?


681
00:30:45.605 --> 00:30:46.813
Sorry.

682
00:30:57.438 --> 00:30:59.230
Such an asshole!

683
00:31:03.896 --> 00:31:05.813
I just want to go on
the record and say


684
00:31:05.813 --> 00:31:08.313
this is a really bad idea.

685
00:31:08.313 --> 00:31:10.271
Why? He does impersonations
of famous people.


686
00:31:10.271 --> 00:31:12.021
How hard could it be
to impersonate someone


687
00:31:12.021 --> 00:31:13.688
- that no one's ever met before?
- Yeah.


688
00:31:13.688 --> 00:31:15.938
We're going to be fine. This
is going to be totally fine.


689
00:31:15.938 --> 00:31:17.480
- You gave him the bible, right?
-  Yeah.


690
00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:19.396
- Good.
- And the Stanicky phone,


691
00:31:19.396 --> 00:31:20.980
everything on it, his Insta.

692
00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:23.313
I FaceTimed him. I took him
through everything, man.


693
00:31:23.313 --> 00:31:25.021
For a sloppy drunk,
he's a real pro


694
00:31:25.021 --> 00:31:26.771
- when it comes to this stuff.
- Fine.


695
00:31:30.021 --> 00:31:32.063
Oh, Jesus.

696
00:31:32.730 --> 00:31:34.230
Please don't be
the trash bag,


697
00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:35.730
please don't be
the trash bag...


698
00:31:35.730 --> 00:31:37.271
It's the trash bag. Oh.

699
00:31:38.938 --> 00:31:41.105
- Dude.
- What the hell?


700
00:31:41.105 --> 00:31:42.896
- Hey, boys.
- What are you on?


701
00:31:42.896 --> 00:31:44.313
Huh?

702
00:31:44.313 --> 00:31:46.355
Don't give me that shit.
What drugs are you on?


703
00:31:46.355 --> 00:31:47.688
None.

704
00:31:47.688 --> 00:31:49.771
Don't lie to us.
You're sweating like a tweaker.


705
00:31:49.771 --> 00:31:51.980
I'm sweating because
I'm not on anything.


706
00:31:51.980 --> 00:31:54.313
I've been cold-turkeying
the booze for three days.


707
00:31:54.313 --> 00:31:57.230
Smashes my world record
by three days.


708
00:31:57.230 --> 00:31:59.730
What? You can't quit drinking
right now, man.


709
00:31:59.730 --> 00:32:00.980
We need you in top form!

710
00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:04.355
I can't drink. Ricky Stanicky's
in the program, remember?


711
00:32:04.355 --> 00:32:06.021
Right, yeah, yeah.

712
00:32:06.021 --> 00:32:08.188
Ricky's been clean and sober
for the past seven years.


713
00:32:08.188 --> 00:32:10.521
Who cares?!
People relapse all the time.


714
00:32:10.521 --> 00:32:12.688
-  Yeah.
-  What are you...?


715
00:32:12.688 --> 00:32:14.021
What are you doing?

716
00:32:14.021 --> 00:32:15.563
Wallet. Mouth.

717
00:32:15.563 --> 00:32:16.938
Oh, oh, oh!

718
00:32:16.938 --> 00:32:18.563
Yeah, I've seen this
on 'Intervention'.


719
00:32:18.563 --> 00:32:19.855
He's having withdrawals.

720
00:32:19.855 --> 00:32:21.355
The leather will
calm him down.


721
00:32:21.355 --> 00:32:23.771
- Relax. It's okay.
- Yeah.


722
00:32:24.813 --> 00:32:26.021
You okay?

723
00:32:26.730 --> 00:32:28.688
I had a couple of those
in the plane - they pass.


724
00:32:29.688 --> 00:32:32.438
The nice fella I walked off
the plane with, he helped me.


725
00:32:32.438 --> 00:32:33.813
What fella?

726
00:32:33.813 --> 00:32:36.730
He was just... he was just
here. You didn't see him?


727
00:32:36.730 --> 00:32:38.938
Curly eyes. Long blonde lips.
He talks with a limp.


728
00:32:38.938 --> 00:32:39.938
All right, uh,

729
00:32:39.938 --> 00:32:41.688
how about we just take
a little whiff of vodka,


730
00:32:41.688 --> 00:32:43.188
you know,
just to take the edge off?


731
00:32:43.188 --> 00:32:44.355
- Yeah. A little bit.
- Yeah?


732
00:32:44.355 --> 00:32:46.730
No, you hired me to play
the role of a sober gentleman.


733
00:32:46.730 --> 00:32:48.521
I'm going to do so
the only way I know how -


734
00:32:48.521 --> 00:32:50.480
with artistic integrity.

735
00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:52.521
What is that?
Is somebody boiling lobster?


736
00:32:53.730 --> 00:32:56.021
Boiling what? Oh, Rod.

737
00:32:56.688 --> 00:32:58.271
- Oh.

738
00:32:58.271 --> 00:33:00.938
It's not what you think it is.

739
00:33:00.938 --> 00:33:02.855
It's just piss.

740
00:33:02.855 --> 00:33:04.313
Oh, thank God.

741
00:33:07.813 --> 00:33:10.563
I can't believe you guys
picked me up in this thing.


742
00:33:10.563 --> 00:33:11.730
What?

743
00:33:11.730 --> 00:33:14.480
This gas-guzzling,
carbon-emitting Earth-killer.


744
00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:16.271
If your people see me
pull up in this thing,


745
00:33:16.271 --> 00:33:18.021
my cover is blown for sure.

746
00:33:18.021 --> 00:33:20.980
He's right again. Ricky
Stanicky's a tree hugger.


747
00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:23.771
We helped him clean up
the Chesapeake Bay, remember?


748
00:33:24.313 --> 00:33:26.230
The Pats/Ravens game.
That was a good game.


749
00:33:28.146 --> 00:33:30.230
-  Who's that?
- Nobody.


750
00:33:30.230 --> 00:33:33.605
All right, who's the bank?
I want all my cheese up front.


751
00:33:33.605 --> 00:33:37.146
SAG minimum - $983 a day,
meal penalty after six hours.


752
00:33:37.146 --> 00:33:39.396
Dude, there is no way
you're in the union.


753
00:33:39.396 --> 00:33:41.396
We'll give you half now
and half when you're done.


754
00:33:41.396 --> 00:33:43.271
That's a no-bueno.
I want all my cake up front.


755
00:33:43.271 --> 00:33:44.313
It's not negotiable.

756
00:33:44.313 --> 00:33:46.396
Okay, then, that's a bueno.

757
00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:49.980
Guys, we can't take him
to the bris smelling like this.


758
00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:51.688
Wes, can you please take
Mr. Stanicky


759
00:33:51.688 --> 00:33:53.313
over to your place
and shower him off


760
00:33:53.313 --> 00:33:55.063
and then bring him
over to JT's?


761
00:33:55.063 --> 00:33:58.605
It's 'Ricky'. Mr. Stanicky
is my fake father's name.


762
00:33:58.605 --> 00:34:02.271
Um, hey, I don't think
that's going to be a good idea.


763
00:34:02.271 --> 00:34:04.188
My shower curtains,
they're all mouldy and shit.


764
00:34:04.188 --> 00:34:05.313
Wes, stop being a douchebag.

765
00:34:05.313 --> 00:34:07.230
Erin and I have to get there
early and help set up.


766
00:34:07.230 --> 00:34:09.188
So we're going to be there
way before you. Just...


767
00:34:09.188 --> 00:34:12.063
I don't know, do what you can,
make him presentable, please.


768
00:34:12.063 --> 00:34:13.938
Presentable? How dare you.

769
00:34:13.938 --> 00:34:15.855
You guys are supposed to be
my best friends.


770
00:34:15.855 --> 00:34:17.813
You should be fighting over
who gets to hose me down.


771
00:34:17.813 --> 00:34:20.855
Hey, grand-mal piss-pants.
Shut the fuck up, okay?


772
00:34:20.855 --> 00:34:22.271
We wouldn't be
in this predicament


773
00:34:22.271 --> 00:34:24.730
if you didn't show up smelling
like a nursing-home mattress.


774
00:34:26.688 --> 00:34:29.688
Wow. This is a hostile set.

775
00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:43.896
Thanks for that, man.

776
00:34:43.896 --> 00:34:45.855
Starting to feel
a little human again.


777
00:34:45.855 --> 00:34:47.521
Yeah. Hey, let me
ask you something.


778
00:34:48.688 --> 00:34:50.230
You're a raging alcoholic, right?

779
00:34:50.230 --> 00:34:51.521
Yeah.

780
00:34:51.521 --> 00:34:53.480
Well, then how do
you stay so ripped?


781
00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:56.146
- Roids. Shit-ton of roids.
- Hmm.


782
00:34:56.146 --> 00:34:58.771
I got addicted to those too.

783
00:34:59.521 --> 00:35:01.188
God, they're good.

784
00:35:07.396 --> 00:35:09.146
Wow. Gay much?

785
00:35:09.146 --> 00:35:11.605
Yeah. I was really
feeling it that day.


786
00:35:15.230 --> 00:35:17.230
Oh, so this is your, um...

787
00:35:17.230 --> 00:35:20.480
Partner, Keith. Mmm.

788
00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:21.771
Of course.

789
00:35:21.771 --> 00:35:25.105
By the way, I kind of told him
that you were bi.


790
00:35:25.938 --> 00:35:27.105
What? Why?

791
00:35:27.105 --> 00:35:29.605
Because it'd be weird
if you weren't...


792
00:35:29.605 --> 00:35:30.855
since we dated.

793
00:35:30.855 --> 00:35:33.396
We dated? You and me?
Was that in the bible?


794
00:35:34.605 --> 00:35:36.521
- I missed that.
- No, it's not in there.


795
00:35:36.521 --> 00:35:38.230
Why the hell
wasn't it in the bible?


796
00:35:38.230 --> 00:35:40.813
Well, 'cause I couldn't tell
the guys. All right?


797
00:35:40.813 --> 00:35:43.188
Look, look, I didn't know
how things would go


798
00:35:43.188 --> 00:35:44.771
on my first date with Keith.

799
00:35:44.771 --> 00:35:47.271
So I told him I was seeing
this dude named Ricky Stanicky,


800
00:35:47.271 --> 00:35:48.813
in case I needed an out.

801
00:35:48.813 --> 00:35:51.438
But we hit it off
and I told him we broke up.


802
00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:53.396
Okay, no problem.

803
00:35:53.396 --> 00:35:57.813
Unfortunately, Keith's still
a little threatened by you.


804
00:35:59.855 --> 00:36:02.813
Okay, spill the beans.
I got to know everything.


805
00:36:02.813 --> 00:36:04.771
- What did you tell him we did?
- What do you mean?


806
00:36:04.771 --> 00:36:07.188
Cut the crap.
You know what I mean.


807
00:36:07.188 --> 00:36:09.146
Did we play Winnie the Pooh
finds a honey stick?


808
00:36:09.146 --> 00:36:11.188
- What's that?
- Munchkins in a cave?


809
00:36:11.188 --> 00:36:12.521
Upside-down barber?

810
00:36:12.521 --> 00:36:13.771
Shaved biscuits and gravy?

811
00:36:13.771 --> 00:36:14.896
- No.
- Old faceful?


812
00:36:14.896 --> 00:36:17.688
No! We just went on
a couple of dates.


813
00:36:18.855 --> 00:36:21.313
Oh. I guess
I didn't do it for you.


814
00:36:22.188 --> 00:36:24.063
You're no trophy either,
beagle ears.


815
00:36:26.896 --> 00:36:28.605
Hey, what's this?

816
00:36:28.605 --> 00:36:32.813
Oh, it's just this...
this children's book thing


817
00:36:32.813 --> 00:36:35.188
that I've been tinkering with.

818
00:36:39.980 --> 00:36:43.313
Hey, there he is!
Our mohel, Rabbi Greenberg.


819
00:36:43.313 --> 00:36:45.730
You can call me
Rabbi Gigglebird.


820
00:36:47.146 --> 00:36:48.646
The Rabbi
does stand-up sometimes


821
00:36:48.646 --> 00:36:50.105
at the Comedy Connection.

822
00:36:50.105 --> 00:36:53.896
I may not be able to eat ham,
but I can certainly be one!


823
00:36:55.146 --> 00:36:56.605
Cheese puffs, anyone?

824
00:36:56.605 --> 00:36:59.980
Oh, no, we mohels,
we prefer those little weenies.


825
00:36:59.980 --> 00:37:01.521
Ba-doomp-pow!

826
00:37:02.521 --> 00:37:04.271
Oh, no...

827
00:37:04.271 --> 00:37:05.730
Listen. Listen.

828
00:37:05.730 --> 00:37:07.688
My services here today
are complimentary,


829
00:37:07.688 --> 00:37:09.188
just so you know, all right?

830
00:37:09.188 --> 00:37:11.105
I consider this a mitzvah.
All right?


831
00:37:11.105 --> 00:37:12.605
I don't want any money,

832
00:37:12.605 --> 00:37:14.980
but I'm keeping the tip!

833
00:37:16.146 --> 00:37:18.646
- They just keep on coming, huh?
- Yeah, they don't stop.


834
00:37:18.646 --> 00:37:20.355
- All right.
- You're hungry, I bet.


835
00:37:20.355 --> 00:37:21.355
Always.

836
00:37:21.355 --> 00:37:23.813
Please. You got to fill up
before you... Right?


837
00:37:23.813 --> 00:37:26.730
- Go. It's all you, baby.
- Yeah, yeah. Go get it. Dig in.


838
00:37:26.730 --> 00:37:28.855
Back off the vodka, lady.

839
00:37:29.896 --> 00:37:31.563
Oh, Jesus Christ.

840
00:37:32.146 --> 00:37:35.063
Can I get a gin and tonic?
And let's make it a double.


841
00:37:35.063 --> 00:37:36.480
What the fuck
is Summerhayes doing here?


842
00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:37.688
I invited him.

843
00:37:37.688 --> 00:37:39.938
- Oh, my God.
- Babe, why would you do that?


844
00:37:39.938 --> 00:37:41.355
Because he's your boss.

845
00:37:41.355 --> 00:37:43.771
Yeah. I don't want to
hang out with my boss.


846
00:37:43.771 --> 00:37:45.938
Why not? You invited him
to the baby shower, shithead.


847
00:37:45.938 --> 00:37:48.980
That's different. This is
a cock-cutting ceremony.


848
00:37:48.980 --> 00:37:50.146
I don't want him here.

849
00:37:50.146 --> 00:37:52.730
Jesus Christ, you're being
weird. Just go say hi.


850
00:37:52.730 --> 00:37:54.271
Both of you. Go.

851
00:37:54.271 --> 00:37:56.480
Great. This is just great.

852
00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:58.438
Now if Stanicky shits the bed,
we lose our jobs.


853
00:37:58.980 --> 00:38:01.271
God, where is he?
He should be here by now.


854
00:38:01.771 --> 00:38:03.313
Explain it again.

855
00:38:03.313 --> 00:38:05.771
It's a children's story
about these seeds


856
00:38:05.771 --> 00:38:08.313
that are flying in the breeze,

857
00:38:08.313 --> 00:38:11.271
and all they want to do is
reach the top of this mountain.


858
00:38:11.271 --> 00:38:15.146
But there's this one little
seed who gets blown back


859
00:38:15.146 --> 00:38:17.188
to the bottom of the mountain,

860
00:38:17.188 --> 00:38:19.313
and she's all like, "Fuck!"

861
00:38:19.313 --> 00:38:22.730
But when it starts to rain,
all the water will start


862
00:38:22.730 --> 00:38:26.855
to flow down the side of
the mountain straight to her.


863
00:38:26.855 --> 00:38:29.480
So she'll sprout
and she'll grow and grow


864
00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:30.896
to be the biggest tree of all,

865
00:38:30.896 --> 00:38:33.313
even bigger than the ones
on top of the mountain.


866
00:38:33.313 --> 00:38:34.938
The message being,

867
00:38:34.938 --> 00:38:38.521
you can be great in life,
no matter where you start.


868
00:38:40.896 --> 00:38:42.480
Hot, wet shit.

869
00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:44.188
What-what...
what are you talking about?


870
00:38:44.188 --> 00:38:45.855
Come on, man,
you're not a farmer.


871
00:38:45.855 --> 00:38:47.938
What the hell do you
know about seeds, right?


872
00:38:47.938 --> 00:38:49.438
And the message is absurd.

873
00:38:49.438 --> 00:38:53.480
Poor kids turn into trees?
It doesn't make any sense.


874
00:38:53.480 --> 00:38:54.563
- You're right.
- Right?


875
00:38:54.563 --> 00:38:55.813
It is stupid. It's stupid!

876
00:38:55.813 --> 00:38:57.646
What the fuck
was I thinking, man? Yeah.


877
00:38:57.646 --> 00:38:58.813
I should just give up.

878
00:38:58.813 --> 00:39:00.896
Whoa. No.
That's not what I said.


879
00:39:00.896 --> 00:39:02.521
I said this is crap,

880
00:39:02.521 --> 00:39:04.271
because it's not authentic.

881
00:39:04.271 --> 00:39:06.063
Doesn't mean you gotta give up.

882
00:39:07.105 --> 00:39:08.855
Let me tell you a story, cowboy.

883
00:39:08.855 --> 00:39:10.271
A few years back,

884
00:39:10.271 --> 00:39:12.688
I had an X-rated dog show
at the Showboat.


885
00:39:12.688 --> 00:39:15.605
I had these two mutts that
could bang missionary style.


886
00:39:15.605 --> 00:39:17.938
Oh, yeah, you heard me right.
Missionary!


887
00:39:17.938 --> 00:39:19.980
Face-to-face. Real deal.

888
00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:21.521
It was kind of touching, actually.

889
00:39:21.521 --> 00:39:22.980
Then Atlantic City
gets all woke


890
00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:25.521
and they won't let 'em pump
on stage anymore.


891
00:39:25.521 --> 00:39:28.313
I tried doing the show with
two guys in dog suits, but...


892
00:39:28.313 --> 00:39:29.688
the magic just wasn't there.

893
00:39:29.688 --> 00:39:30.730
You know what I mean?

894
00:39:32.271 --> 00:39:34.438
- No.
- My point is, I failed.


895
00:39:34.438 --> 00:39:36.355
But did I give up? Heck no.

896
00:39:36.355 --> 00:39:38.313
I just had to ask myself,
what do I love?


897
00:39:38.313 --> 00:39:39.313
And then it was easy -

898
00:39:39.313 --> 00:39:41.563
singing, performing
and telling filthy jokes.


899
00:39:41.563 --> 00:39:44.521
And that is when Rock Hard Rod
was born.


900
00:39:44.521 --> 00:39:47.646
You, sir, have just found out

901
00:39:47.646 --> 00:39:51.313
your dogs can no longer bang
missionary style.


902
00:39:51.313 --> 00:39:54.313
Now you got to ask yourself,
what do you love?


903
00:39:54.313 --> 00:39:56.188
- What do I love?
- Yeah.


904
00:39:56.188 --> 00:39:57.771
Ah...

905
00:39:58.438 --> 00:40:00.771
Yeah, I... I like ceramic owls?

906
00:40:00.771 --> 00:40:03.396
Uh... I love fog.

907
00:40:03.396 --> 00:40:05.146
I love fog! I love it.

908
00:40:05.146 --> 00:40:07.355
Er, is there anything
that you like


909
00:40:07.355 --> 00:40:10.896
that a regular human being
can relate to on any level?


910
00:40:12.438 --> 00:40:14.230
- I like Christmas.
- Christmas, Christmas!


911
00:40:14.230 --> 00:40:16.563
Perfect! Yes!
Everybody loves Christmas.


912
00:40:16.563 --> 00:40:18.146
Yeah, well, not everybody.

913
00:40:18.146 --> 00:40:20.521
Keith is not a big fan of it
these days.


914
00:40:20.521 --> 00:40:22.771
- He doesn't love Christmas?
- Well, he used to love it.


915
00:40:22.771 --> 00:40:23.771
But, I mean,

916
00:40:23.771 --> 00:40:25.896
ever since his parents
found out that we were dating,


917
00:40:25.896 --> 00:40:27.563
they haven't really
invited him over.


918
00:40:27.563 --> 00:40:30.021
- That sucks.
- Yeah.


919
00:40:30.021 --> 00:40:31.563
Which is their loss, you know.

920
00:40:31.563 --> 00:40:33.188
No "Jerky of the Month Club"
for them.


921
00:40:33.188 --> 00:40:34.813
Ha.

922
00:40:34.813 --> 00:40:37.230
I just wish there was
a holiday tradition for us.


923
00:40:37.230 --> 00:40:40.480
You know, like Christmas is
the gayest holiday anyway, man.


924
00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:42.688
You know, you bedazzle
a tree with tinsel.


925
00:40:43.396 --> 00:40:45.771
And why does Santa
have to be such a fat shit?


926
00:40:45.771 --> 00:40:48.021
Couldn't he be ripped? Couldn't
he be jacked? You know?


927
00:40:48.021 --> 00:40:49.855
Can the elves have
ordered him a Peloton


928
00:40:49.855 --> 00:40:51.355
or a yoga mat or something?

929
00:40:52.563 --> 00:40:53.980
Ra-pum-pum-pum.

930
00:40:53.980 --> 00:40:56.063
Now that is authentic!

931
00:40:57.105 --> 00:40:59.688
Yeah. A Christmas story for us.

932
00:41:02.230 --> 00:41:03.855
Thanks for coming, Ted.

933
00:41:03.855 --> 00:41:06.480
I know a bris
isn't exactly your cup of tea.


934
00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:08.980
Oh, no, we're happy
that you invited us, JT.


935
00:41:08.980 --> 00:41:11.355
This is exactly
what Ted needed.


936
00:41:11.355 --> 00:41:14.688
He's been so obsessed
with this World River merger.


937
00:41:14.688 --> 00:41:16.188
Yeah.

938
00:41:16.188 --> 00:41:19.313
Circumcision parties are
my go-to when I need to relax.


939
00:41:21.063 --> 00:41:22.730
Where's Gary?
I thought he was coming.


940
00:41:22.730 --> 00:41:24.230
He has his improv class
at Trinity,


941
00:41:24.230 --> 00:41:25.688
but I think he'll be here soon.

942
00:41:25.688 --> 00:41:27.271
Have you guys seen
his new commercial?


943
00:41:27.271 --> 00:41:28.896
Yeah. Yeah.

944
00:41:28.896 --> 00:41:31.271
- He got off.
- Who got off?


945
00:41:31.271 --> 00:41:32.896
My big story
I'm covering this week.


946
00:41:32.896 --> 00:41:34.730
You're covering a trial?

947
00:41:34.730 --> 00:41:36.521
No, real reporters
get to do that.


948
00:41:36.521 --> 00:41:38.813
I'm covering a vicious duck
sitting on a golf ball


949
00:41:38.813 --> 00:41:40.396
- at Wannamoisett Country Club.
- Oh.


950
00:41:40.396 --> 00:41:41.896
You're just paying
your dues, right?


951
00:41:42.396 --> 00:41:44.730
You're going to get a shot
at the big story soon.


952
00:41:44.730 --> 00:41:45.730
Thanks, babe.

953
00:41:45.730 --> 00:41:47.313
He's not coming, is he?

954
00:41:47.896 --> 00:41:50.521
- Who would you be referring to?
- Oh, don't give me that.


955
00:41:50.521 --> 00:41:53.063
Ricky Stanicky.
Where the hell is he?


956
00:41:53.063 --> 00:41:55.938
Oh, he'll be here.
This is just typical Ricky.


957
00:41:55.938 --> 00:41:57.521
He's... he's always late.

958
00:41:57.521 --> 00:42:00.063
Hmm. Well, I'll believe it
when I see it.


959
00:42:00.063 --> 00:42:03.521
Leona, come on.
Why wouldn't he come?


960
00:42:03.521 --> 00:42:05.105
Probably for the same reason

961
00:42:05.105 --> 00:42:08.688
that he didn't bother to show
up for JT and Susan's wedding.


962
00:42:08.688 --> 00:42:10.896
Sorry he didn't think
my wedding was more important


963
00:42:10.896 --> 00:42:13.313
than digging out hurricane
victims in the Bahamas.


964
00:42:13.313 --> 00:42:14.521
Ooh.

965
00:42:14.521 --> 00:42:17.355
Ha, ha!
The old Bahamian hurricane.


966
00:42:17.355 --> 00:42:19.980
Jackie, tell me about
Ricky Stanicky.


967
00:42:19.980 --> 00:42:22.438
I mean, if they were
such good friends,


968
00:42:22.438 --> 00:42:25.230
you must have met him a bunch
when they were kids, right?


969
00:42:25.813 --> 00:42:28.771
Oh, sure.
I... I met all of JT's friends.


970
00:42:28.771 --> 00:42:30.063
Really?

971
00:42:30.063 --> 00:42:32.980
Do you have any
specific memories of him?


972
00:42:33.521 --> 00:42:37.396
Well, I remember he was
a handful, that's for sure.


973
00:42:37.396 --> 00:42:39.563
I mean, every time
this one got in trouble,


974
00:42:39.563 --> 00:42:41.105
Stanicky was somehow behind it.

975
00:42:41.105 --> 00:42:43.105
He was a... a little devil,
that Ricky.


976
00:42:43.105 --> 00:42:44.855
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.
- Wow!


977
00:42:44.855 --> 00:42:47.230
That doesn't sound like
the same guy


978
00:42:47.230 --> 00:42:52.396
who works for Bono in Africa
and builds orphanages in Peru.


979
00:42:53.688 --> 00:42:55.230
That's 'cause he's born again.

980
00:42:55.230 --> 00:42:57.480
- Ah.
- He had that epiphany in rehab.


981
00:42:57.480 --> 00:42:59.105
Remember I told you about that?

982
00:42:59.105 --> 00:43:01.188
- Mm-hm.
- Yeah, people change, Leona.


983
00:43:01.188 --> 00:43:03.230
Why are you grilling my mom?
She's not on trial.


984
00:43:03.230 --> 00:43:04.688
Because I want you to admit

985
00:43:04.688 --> 00:43:07.021
that Ricky Stanicky
does not exist.


986
00:43:10.146 --> 00:43:12.855
Hey, mishpocha!

987
00:43:12.855 --> 00:43:15.021
Let's get down to bris-ness!

988
00:43:16.646 --> 00:43:18.771
Oh, yes! Yeah-ah!

989
00:43:18.771 --> 00:43:20.188
You made it!

990
00:43:20.813 --> 00:43:22.605
The boys are back!

991
00:43:24.938 --> 00:43:26.980
- All right.
- Jackie!


992
00:43:26.980 --> 00:43:28.313
Ricky?

993
00:43:28.313 --> 00:43:31.480
Oh, you look unbelievable.
You're still a MILF.


994
00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:33.271
Oh, my God.

995
00:43:33.271 --> 00:43:36.230
Look at you.
Oh, you haven't changed a bit.


996
00:43:37.271 --> 00:43:38.938
The mystery man in the flesh.

997
00:43:38.938 --> 00:43:41.438
Well, churn my butter
with a slippery stick.


998
00:43:41.438 --> 00:43:42.938
I finally get to meet
Erin Harford.


999
00:43:42.938 --> 00:43:44.605
You're even more beautiful
in person


1000
00:43:44.605 --> 00:43:46.355
than the pictures
Dean's always sending me.


1001
00:43:46.355 --> 00:43:47.730
You send him pictures of me?

1002
00:43:47.730 --> 00:43:49.271
Oh, tasteful, of course.

1003
00:43:49.271 --> 00:43:50.355
Even the nudes.

1004
00:43:50.355 --> 00:43:52.188
Seriously, the guy
doesn't shut up about you.


1005
00:43:52.188 --> 00:43:54.146
What were you saying
about her last week?


1006
00:43:54.146 --> 00:43:55.730
It was, um...

1007
00:43:55.730 --> 00:43:57.521
Ah!
The more I look at her,


1008
00:43:57.521 --> 00:43:59.521
the more I realize
how much there is to see.


1009
00:43:59.521 --> 00:44:01.771
- Aw. Babe.
- And who do we have here?


1010
00:44:01.771 --> 00:44:04.313
Rapunzel, Rapunzel,
let down your hair!


1011
00:44:04.313 --> 00:44:06.480
I'm Carly,
I'm Erin's cousin.


1012
00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:08.105
No need to shout, bullhorn!

1013
00:44:09.646 --> 00:44:12.813
And I am the woman
who had to give birth all alone


1014
00:44:12.813 --> 00:44:15.230
because you tricked her husband
into going to Albany.


1015
00:44:15.230 --> 00:44:17.021
Oh, my God, Susan,
I'm so sorry.


1016
00:44:18.105 --> 00:44:20.230
You know how much grief
your old man's been giving me?


1017
00:44:20.230 --> 00:44:22.646
For the record, I had no idea
it was your baby shower.


1018
00:44:22.646 --> 00:44:24.355
I just wanted to celebrate
my new lease on life


1019
00:44:24.355 --> 00:44:25.646
with my oldest,
dearest friends.


1020
00:44:26.521 --> 00:44:28.313
Then little Whitaker
comes along...


1021
00:44:28.313 --> 00:44:29.813
God, I love that name.

1022
00:44:31.021 --> 00:44:33.480
And then I just
ruin everything.


1023
00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:36.355
I just...
Again, my sincerest apologies.


1024
00:44:36.355 --> 00:44:37.938
No, you know, it...

1025
00:44:37.938 --> 00:44:40.396
It's okay. I know you've
been through a lot, so...


1026
00:44:40.396 --> 00:44:42.688
Hell, yeah, they lopped off
one of my nuts, for starters.


1027
00:44:42.688 --> 00:44:45.688
- Oh, you are still a handful!

1028
00:44:45.688 --> 00:44:47.313
Well, half a handful.

1029
00:44:47.313 --> 00:44:48.688
- Ricky...

1030
00:44:48.688 --> 00:44:51.146
Okay, Rico! Hey, let's go
show you around. Huh?


1031
00:44:51.146 --> 00:44:52.771
Aren't you going to
Introduce me?


1032
00:44:52.771 --> 00:44:54.480
Uh, we'll be right back.

1033
00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:56.730
Stay away from
that woman at all costs, okay?


1034
00:44:56.730 --> 00:44:58.813
That's Susan's mother.
She's bad news.


1035
00:45:02.355 --> 00:45:03.855
Jesus.

1036
00:45:05.021 --> 00:45:07.813
Hey, if anyone asks
about the shaking, just say,


1037
00:45:07.813 --> 00:45:09.813
"I have low blood sugar
and I had a Red Bull."


1038
00:45:09.813 --> 00:45:11.146
Stopping you there.

1039
00:45:11.771 --> 00:45:13.730
I don't appreciate
line readings.


1040
00:45:15.105 --> 00:45:16.313
What?

1041
00:45:16.313 --> 00:45:18.021
So, I lift up the mosquito net

1042
00:45:18.021 --> 00:45:20.188
and, sure enough,
Bono's in there.


1043
00:45:20.188 --> 00:45:22.188
Plowing Mrs. Bono
like a potato field.


1044
00:45:22.188 --> 00:45:23.730
Really? The Bono?

1045
00:45:23.730 --> 00:45:27.396
Yeah. Givin' the missus the old
Irish shillelagh, as it were.


1046
00:45:27.396 --> 00:45:28.896
So I'm standing there
embarrassed.


1047
00:45:28.896 --> 00:45:30.605
And then they go,
"It's okay.


1048
00:45:30.605 --> 00:45:31.855
"Watch us, we like it."

1049
00:45:31.855 --> 00:45:33.271
Is that an Irish thing?

1050
00:45:33.271 --> 00:45:36.355
I don't think so. But
I wouldn't put it past them.


1051
00:45:36.355 --> 00:45:39.230
Hey, the guy saved ten million
people from starving.


1052
00:45:39.230 --> 00:45:40.980
So, if he wants to let people

1053
00:45:40.980 --> 00:45:43.855
watch him corn-beef his wife's
cabbage, who am I to stop him?


1054
00:45:43.855 --> 00:45:47.105
You know who has the best
corn-beef in town? Geoff's.


1055
00:45:47.105 --> 00:45:49.146
And it isn't even really
a deli.


1056
00:45:49.146 --> 00:45:51.105
I don't think that's
the kind of corn-beef


1057
00:45:51.105 --> 00:45:52.480
he's talking about, Ginny.

1058
00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:54.521
Oh, man, all this food talk
is making me hungry.


1059
00:45:54.521 --> 00:45:56.480
- Ricky, have you eaten yet?
-  Dean.


1060
00:45:56.480 --> 00:46:00.896
You haven't introduced me
to Indiana Jones here.


1061
00:46:00.896 --> 00:46:02.480
Yeah, of course.

1062
00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:05.063
Ted, this is Ricky Stanicky,
my good friend.


1063
00:46:05.063 --> 00:46:06.855
Uh, Ricky, this is
Ted Summerhayes, my boss.


1064
00:46:06.855 --> 00:46:07.938
Ted, nice to meet you.

1065
00:46:07.938 --> 00:46:10.146
Digging the suit
and the seedlings, man.


1066
00:46:10.146 --> 00:46:11.521
The seedlings?

1067
00:46:11.521 --> 00:46:13.188
The hair plugs.
They're new, right?


1068
00:46:13.188 --> 00:46:14.396
What?

1069
00:46:14.396 --> 00:46:17.230
No. This is my hair.

1070
00:46:17.230 --> 00:46:20.271
Ha! Yeah, just like
a doll's hair is her hair.


1071
00:46:20.271 --> 00:46:21.563
That's good. That's good.

1072
00:46:22.063 --> 00:46:24.480
So, Ted, you're one of those
big banker guys, eh?


1073
00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:25.688
One of those guys out there

1074
00:46:25.688 --> 00:46:27.355
helping those billionaires
get richer


1075
00:46:27.355 --> 00:46:29.730
and then floating around on
your big swinging super-yachts,


1076
00:46:29.730 --> 00:46:31.688
leaving everybody else
struggling to make ends meet


1077
00:46:31.688 --> 00:46:32.688
in their little dinghies.

1078
00:46:32.688 --> 00:46:35.480
- No. No, no, no. Not at all...
- First of all,


1079
00:46:35.480 --> 00:46:39.271
we sell financial services
to independent investors,


1080
00:46:39.271 --> 00:46:41.563
and anyone
who's willing to pay for them


1081
00:46:41.563 --> 00:46:44.021
is welcome
to share in the benefits.


1082
00:46:44.021 --> 00:46:46.105
Whatever helps you
sleep at night, Ebenezer.


1083
00:46:46.105 --> 00:46:48.063
Uh, if memory serves me,

1084
00:46:48.063 --> 00:46:49.313
Ebenezer Scrooge ends up

1085
00:46:49.313 --> 00:46:50.813
becoming the hero
of that story.


1086
00:46:50.813 --> 00:46:53.063
- It's Ricky, right?
-  Yeah.


1087
00:46:53.063 --> 00:46:57.355
I'm wondering, Ricky, are you
always such a bust-out asshole,


1088
00:46:57.355 --> 00:46:58.771
right out of the gate?

1089
00:46:58.771 --> 00:47:00.396
Only when I'm talking
to the type of guy


1090
00:47:00.396 --> 00:47:02.563
who can make a real
difference in this world.


1091
00:47:02.563 --> 00:47:04.896
Ted, Ricky's been
working overseas


1092
00:47:04.896 --> 00:47:07.021
for the last decade
on non-profits.


1093
00:47:07.021 --> 00:47:10.313
So at least he walks the walk.

1094
00:47:10.938 --> 00:47:13.188
Well, that's nice,

1095
00:47:13.188 --> 00:47:16.521
but he's obviously getting
his financial information


1096
00:47:16.521 --> 00:47:17.855
from 'The Huffington Post'.

1097
00:47:17.855 --> 00:47:19.438
No, actually, I've been reading

1098
00:47:19.438 --> 00:47:20.896
the 'San Francisco Chronicle'
lately.


1099
00:47:20.896 --> 00:47:21.896
I've been following

1100
00:47:21.896 --> 00:47:23.313
your potential merger
with World River.


1101
00:47:23.313 --> 00:47:24.855
It's interesting, unexpected.

1102
00:47:26.021 --> 00:47:27.938
Okay, hey, uh,
there's a ton of people inside


1103
00:47:27.938 --> 00:47:30.230
- that still wanna meet you.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.


1104
00:47:30.230 --> 00:47:31.480
I'd like to hear this.

1105
00:47:32.563 --> 00:47:34.480
Unexpected, how?

1106
00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:36.355
Oh, come on.

1107
00:47:36.355 --> 00:47:38.730
They're the yin,
and you got that big old yang.


1108
00:47:38.730 --> 00:47:40.230
It's a perfect fit.

1109
00:47:40.230 --> 00:47:42.146
In what way?

1110
00:47:42.146 --> 00:47:45.980
Well, you're old school.
They're new age.


1111
00:47:45.980 --> 00:47:48.646
You got common sense,
but they got radical new ideas.


1112
00:47:48.646 --> 00:47:50.146
For my money,
I'm going common sense


1113
00:47:50.146 --> 00:47:51.605
over radical new ideas all day.

1114
00:47:51.605 --> 00:47:53.730
I'm sure the people in Portland
and San Francisco agree.


1115
00:47:53.730 --> 00:47:55.230
And that's what
makes you guys great.


1116
00:47:55.230 --> 00:47:56.980
But they're pretty good too.

1117
00:47:56.980 --> 00:48:00.021
But, together, you guys
would be unstoppable.


1118
00:48:00.938 --> 00:48:03.521
This merger could make a real
difference in this world, Ted.


1119
00:48:03.521 --> 00:48:04.771
A real difference.

1120
00:48:06.230 --> 00:48:07.896
Yin and yang, huh?

1121
00:48:08.980 --> 00:48:11.646
Oh, don't mind if I do. Thanks.

1122
00:48:16.896 --> 00:48:19.188
Where the hell did you hear
about the World River deal?


1123
00:48:19.188 --> 00:48:20.730
They were all over
your Twitter.


1124
00:48:20.730 --> 00:48:22.105
I just did a little research.

1125
00:48:22.105 --> 00:48:23.813
What are you doing
on my Twitter?


1126
00:48:23.813 --> 00:48:25.688
Dean, I told you I'm an actor.

1127
00:48:25.688 --> 00:48:27.021
When I walk into a room,

1128
00:48:27.021 --> 00:48:28.646
I want to know exactly
where I came from


1129
00:48:28.646 --> 00:48:30.855
and what every single person
in that room's been doing.


1130
00:48:30.855 --> 00:48:32.646
That's what all the greats do.

1131
00:48:32.646 --> 00:48:34.146
Matt Damon
actually bought a zoo


1132
00:48:34.146 --> 00:48:35.563
before he filmed
'We Bought a Zoo'.


1133
00:48:35.563 --> 00:48:37.021
I don't think that's true.

1134
00:48:37.021 --> 00:48:38.980
You don't believe me?
Take it up with Reddit.


1135
00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:41.563
Oh, if you'll excuse me,

1136
00:48:41.563 --> 00:48:43.105
I got to go
have a word with Keith.


1137
00:48:43.105 --> 00:48:45.563
What? How do you know Keith?!

1138
00:48:46.646 --> 00:48:50.396
We're in a weird
love-triangle thing.


1139
00:48:51.855 --> 00:48:55.521
Look, all I'm saying is I hope
there's no hard feelings.


1140
00:48:55.521 --> 00:48:57.438
Because let's face it,
you won.


1141
00:48:58.271 --> 00:48:59.521
But I'm happy for you.

1142
00:48:59.521 --> 00:49:01.146
You guys make
a fabulous couple.


1143
00:49:01.146 --> 00:49:03.021
I'm done with his ass.

1144
00:49:04.980 --> 00:49:07.146
Look, I still love the guy,

1145
00:49:07.146 --> 00:49:08.980
but I'm tired of working

1146
00:49:08.980 --> 00:49:11.896
while he sits around not doing
anything to improve himself.


1147
00:49:11.896 --> 00:49:13.188
I just...

1148
00:49:13.855 --> 00:49:16.063
I can't be with a person
like that anymore.


1149
00:49:17.146 --> 00:49:19.146
What... what about his writing?
That's work.


1150
00:49:19.146 --> 00:49:20.938
What writing?

1151
00:49:20.938 --> 00:49:22.563
The book he's working on.

1152
00:49:23.188 --> 00:49:25.980
He never told me
he was writing a book.


1153
00:49:26.938 --> 00:49:29.271
He sure looks a lot older
than you guys.


1154
00:49:29.271 --> 00:49:30.521
- Really?
- Mmm.


1155
00:49:30.521 --> 00:49:32.480
Yeah, well, he is,
by a couple years.


1156
00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:35.355
You know, we were like
little brothers to him.


1157
00:49:35.355 --> 00:49:39.771
Hmm, no, I mean, like more
than a couple of years.


1158
00:49:40.355 --> 00:49:41.980
Well, it's because
of the drugs - he...


1159
00:49:41.980 --> 00:49:43.980
You know, he was a huge
partier, back in the day.


1160
00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:45.771
I mean, like hard drugs.

1161
00:49:45.771 --> 00:49:48.063
Huffing glue. Like, the works.

1162
00:49:48.563 --> 00:49:50.855
I mean, that'll suck the youth
right out of your face.


1163
00:49:50.855 --> 00:49:51.855
It does.

1164
00:49:52.396 --> 00:49:53.896
Yeah, that was all before
he went on


1165
00:49:53.896 --> 00:49:55.771
- the straight and narrow.
- Hmm.


1166
00:49:56.396 --> 00:49:58.896
Oh, look at them.
Look how happy they are.


1167
00:49:58.896 --> 00:50:01.188
-  I told you.
-  It's an easy thing.


1168
00:50:01.188 --> 00:50:03.313
-  I don't see happiness.
-  What?


1169
00:50:03.313 --> 00:50:05.605
I see fear and anxiety.

1170
00:50:05.605 --> 00:50:07.313
Fear of what?

1171
00:50:07.313 --> 00:50:08.980
Of the responsibility
of it all.


1172
00:50:08.980 --> 00:50:10.480
What do they even
get out of it?


1173
00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:12.813
What do they get
out of having a family?


1174
00:50:12.813 --> 00:50:14.105
- Yeah.
- Come on.


1175
00:50:14.105 --> 00:50:17.355
I mean, I get it on paper.
Sure, right.


1176
00:50:17.355 --> 00:50:20.646
But in reality, having a kid
is fear and anxiety


1177
00:50:20.646 --> 00:50:22.605
with periodic moments
of crushing pain.


1178
00:50:23.938 --> 00:50:25.688
And then you get
bitter and resentful


1179
00:50:25.688 --> 00:50:28.313
and eventually just... mean.

1180
00:50:30.355 --> 00:50:32.521
At least that's how it was
at my house.


1181
00:50:33.730 --> 00:50:35.480
You realize that's
the most you've ever


1182
00:50:35.480 --> 00:50:36.980
told me about your childhood?

1183
00:50:38.605 --> 00:50:41.021
Look, he is
kind of lost right now,


1184
00:50:41.021 --> 00:50:43.271
but just give him a little
time, he'll figure it out.


1185
00:50:44.188 --> 00:50:46.271
I've given him plenty of time.

1186
00:50:46.980 --> 00:50:49.730
I think you need
to step back in, Ricky.


1187
00:50:49.730 --> 00:50:51.396
Be there for him.

1188
00:50:51.396 --> 00:50:53.480
Ease the blow a little
when I drop him.


1189
00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:55.396
Oh, hey, Keith, slow down.

1190
00:50:55.396 --> 00:50:57.105
Take it from me,
relationships like yours,


1191
00:50:57.105 --> 00:50:58.605
they don't come around
that often.


1192
00:50:58.605 --> 00:50:59.605
They just don't.

1193
00:50:59.605 --> 00:51:01.813
My own mother
was married six times.


1194
00:51:01.813 --> 00:51:03.438
She never found happiness.

1195
00:51:03.438 --> 00:51:04.855
An incredible sex life,

1196
00:51:04.855 --> 00:51:06.771
but she was filled up
with everything but joy.


1197
00:51:07.563 --> 00:51:09.771
You really want to
give up on this?


1198
00:51:09.771 --> 00:51:11.605
May not come back around.

1199
00:51:16.146 --> 00:51:17.521
Ricky!

1200
00:51:18.396 --> 00:51:20.896
I understand you spent
a lot of time in Kenya


1201
00:51:20.896 --> 00:51:23.021
working with
the Give Green organization.


1202
00:51:23.021 --> 00:51:25.813
Yeah, yeah, good peeps.

1203
00:51:25.813 --> 00:51:27.355
Green peeps, yeah.

1204
00:51:27.355 --> 00:51:29.896
I'm interested in
what your experience was there,


1205
00:51:29.896 --> 00:51:31.855
because, you know,
I've been reading up on them


1206
00:51:31.855 --> 00:51:34.980
and they're a really
intriguing organization.


1207
00:51:34.980 --> 00:51:36.146
Yeah, you know what?

1208
00:51:36.146 --> 00:51:38.438
I was just trying to find
one of those cheese-puff trays.


1209
00:51:38.438 --> 00:51:40.730
- I'll show you where they are.
- Right, but before you do,


1210
00:51:40.730 --> 00:51:42.271
can you tell me about
Charlie Sennet?


1211
00:51:42.271 --> 00:51:43.271
Huh?

1212
00:51:43.271 --> 00:51:47.105
Charlie Sennet, the journalist
who started Give Green


1213
00:51:47.105 --> 00:51:48.396
and is still hands on.

1214
00:51:48.396 --> 00:51:50.605
I mean,
did you get to meet him?


1215
00:51:50.605 --> 00:51:52.480
What do you think
of his mission statement?


1216
00:51:52.480 --> 00:51:53.813
Is it tenable?

1217
00:51:53.813 --> 00:51:56.521
Oh, yeah,
of course it's tenable.


1218
00:51:56.521 --> 00:51:57.813
Elevenable, twelveable...

1219
00:51:57.813 --> 00:51:59.480
I mean,
it's infinite really, right?


1220
00:51:59.480 --> 00:52:00.480
Ha-ha.

1221
00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:01.980
I mean, I'm intrigued
by their policy


1222
00:52:01.980 --> 00:52:03.813
of direct charitable donations.

1223
00:52:03.813 --> 00:52:05.313
You know, personally, I think

1224
00:52:05.313 --> 00:52:07.563
donations need
to be conditional.


1225
00:52:07.563 --> 00:52:09.480
What do you think?

1226
00:52:10.146 --> 00:52:11.313
Uh, you know what?

1227
00:52:11.313 --> 00:52:12.855
It's group photo time.
Group photo time.


1228
00:52:12.855 --> 00:52:14.771
Group photo! Come on,
let's make some memories!


1229
00:52:14.771 --> 00:52:15.813
Yeah. Yeah.

1230
00:52:15.813 --> 00:52:17.938
You have no idea what I'm
talking about, do you, Ricky?


1231
00:52:17.938 --> 00:52:20.355
Maybe he just doesn't want
to talk shop at a bris, Leona.


1232
00:52:20.355 --> 00:52:22.896
Or maybe he's a fraud.
Are you a fraud, sir?


1233
00:52:36.271 --> 00:52:37.938
I'll tell you
what's fraudulent, Leona.


1234
00:52:37.938 --> 00:52:38.938
Yeah?

1235
00:52:38.938 --> 00:52:40.771
The perception that
the program at Give Green


1236
00:52:40.771 --> 00:52:42.146
needs to be conditional.

1237
00:52:42.146 --> 00:52:44.105
They choose to offer
unconditional cash transfers


1238
00:52:44.105 --> 00:52:45.188
for two reasons.

1239
00:52:45.188 --> 00:52:47.855
First, empowering poor people
to make their own choices?


1240
00:52:47.855 --> 00:52:50.021
Well, that advances
their core value of respect.


1241
00:52:50.021 --> 00:52:52.021
Second, imposing
conditions requires


1242
00:52:52.021 --> 00:52:54.438
expensive monitoring
and enforcement structures


1243
00:52:54.438 --> 00:52:57.146
that could raise administrative
costs as high as 63%.


1244
00:52:57.646 --> 00:52:59.730
The existing empirical evidence
comparing the impact


1245
00:52:59.730 --> 00:53:02.105
of conditional
to unconditional cash transfers


1246
00:53:02.105 --> 00:53:03.855
shows that these added costs

1247
00:53:03.855 --> 00:53:06.146
simply do not
produce commensurate benefits.


1248
00:53:08.105 --> 00:53:10.438
I wonder where those
cheese-puff trays went off to.


1249
00:53:19.146 --> 00:53:20.771
Did you want a cheese puff,
Leona?


1250
00:53:22.021 --> 00:53:23.521
No, thank you.

1251
00:53:26.396 --> 00:53:27.563
Huh, so what are these?

1252
00:53:27.563 --> 00:53:29.146
Glazed dates
stuffed with Asiago cheese


1253
00:53:29.146 --> 00:53:30.146
and pickled herring.

1254
00:53:30.146 --> 00:53:31.855
Don't mind if I don't.

1255
00:53:31.855 --> 00:53:32.938
No problem.

1256
00:53:34.605 --> 00:53:36.646
- That was amazing.
- Unbelievable.


1257
00:53:36.646 --> 00:53:38.438
Where the hell
did you learn all that stuff?


1258
00:53:38.438 --> 00:53:40.313
Gotta buy the zoo, baby.

1259
00:53:40.313 --> 00:53:41.938
What? Who's that...?

1260
00:53:41.938 --> 00:53:43.521
Gary Polisner's here.

1261
00:53:44.021 --> 00:53:48.021
$8,000. It's on lease,
but that's how much it's worth.


1262
00:53:48.021 --> 00:53:49.188
Oh.

1263
00:53:49.188 --> 00:53:50.730
Hey, Polisner!

1264
00:53:51.355 --> 00:53:54.688
Hey! Well you move along,
I'll talk to you later on.


1265
00:53:54.688 --> 00:53:56.313
Get over here, hey?

1266
00:53:56.313 --> 00:53:58.521
Had to park my Cybertruck
in the next county.


1267
00:53:58.521 --> 00:54:00.396
What, you too cheap
for a valet?


1268
00:54:01.688 --> 00:54:04.021
- Crap! I know that guy.
- What? What guy?


1269
00:54:04.021 --> 00:54:05.771
The guy standing
with Hairy Krishna.


1270
00:54:06.605 --> 00:54:08.396
I saved you a bagel with lox.

1271
00:54:08.396 --> 00:54:10.938
I asked for an everything
bagel. That's a nothing bagel.


1272
00:54:11.438 --> 00:54:13.480
Hey, you got any booze
in this place?


1273
00:54:13.480 --> 00:54:14.480
Yeah.

1274
00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:16.438
Let me guess,
it's a cash bar.


1275
00:54:16.438 --> 00:54:17.938
Oh, shit!

1276
00:54:17.938 --> 00:54:19.521
Go up the stairs.
Go into the garage.


1277
00:54:19.521 --> 00:54:21.563
Just get in there. Don't
come out until I tell you.


1278
00:54:21.563 --> 00:54:22.938
All right? Go, go, go, go, go.

1279
00:54:22.938 --> 00:54:24.271
Fuck.

1280
00:54:24.271 --> 00:54:26.230
And as you can tell,
I actually don't sweat...


1281
00:54:26.230 --> 00:54:27.730
What the fuck
are you saying?


1282
00:54:27.730 --> 00:54:29.688
Ricky knows Polisner.

1283
00:54:29.688 --> 00:54:31.771
- How?
- How the hell do I know?


1284
00:54:31.771 --> 00:54:34.105
They're both actors. Maybe
they crossed paths somehow.


1285
00:54:34.105 --> 00:54:35.730
We got to get Polisner
out of here.


1286
00:54:35.730 --> 00:54:37.188
He just got here.

1287
00:54:38.605 --> 00:54:39.855
Goddamn it.

1288
00:54:39.855 --> 00:54:41.563
We could put him
in a K-hole.


1289
00:54:41.563 --> 00:54:42.605
What's that?

1290
00:54:43.105 --> 00:54:44.355
Dose him with ketamine.

1291
00:54:44.855 --> 00:54:47.313
Yeah, great idea. I'll just run
down to CVS and grab a bottle.


1292
00:54:47.313 --> 00:54:48.646
No need.

1293
00:54:49.938 --> 00:54:51.896
Why the hell
do you have ketamine?


1294
00:54:53.313 --> 00:54:56.563
Well, sometimes
after a hard day, you...


1295
00:54:57.230 --> 00:54:58.855
You K-hole yourself.

1296
00:54:58.855 --> 00:55:01.021
I could see that.
Where do you get these things?


1297
00:55:01.021 --> 00:55:02.563
- My grandmother died.
- Guys!


1298
00:55:02.563 --> 00:55:03.938
We're not K-holing anyone.

1299
00:55:03.938 --> 00:55:06.063
Stop being such
a fucking wang, Dean. Okay?


1300
00:55:06.063 --> 00:55:07.605
We're going to get him
a little drowsy


1301
00:55:07.605 --> 00:55:09.230
and then put him in a cab.

1302
00:55:09.230 --> 00:55:10.521
Are you guys serious right now?

1303
00:55:10.521 --> 00:55:12.271
You want to drug
the Red Robin guy?


1304
00:55:12.271 --> 00:55:14.813
What other fucking choice
do we have?


1305
00:55:14.813 --> 00:55:18.021
"Seconds on steak fries?
Uh, yeah!"


1306
00:55:18.021 --> 00:55:20.855
First take. Everyone applauded.
That's the one they used, too.


1307
00:55:22.813 --> 00:55:25.813
Fuck it.
Let's K-hole the prick.


1308
00:55:25.813 --> 00:55:28.605
-  This is it.
-  Yep, let's go. Let's go.


1309
00:55:30.105 --> 00:55:31.480
-  All right.
-  No way!


1310
00:55:31.480 --> 00:55:33.646
That's right, I hit.
That's right, I hit.


1311
00:55:33.646 --> 00:55:35.563
- Let's go for two.
- He's got you believing.


1312
00:55:35.563 --> 00:55:36.855
Come on, baby. Come on!

1313
00:55:36.855 --> 00:55:38.271
Bad throw. Bad throw.

1314
00:55:38.271 --> 00:55:40.146
Bad throw! Dude, your foot
came off the couch.


1315
00:55:40.146 --> 00:55:42.605
- Oh, hey, Gare.
- Oh, hey, Dean, what's up?


1316
00:55:42.605 --> 00:55:45.688
Hey, uh, you guys seen
my Red Robin commercial yet?


1317
00:55:45.688 --> 00:55:47.771
- We did. Yeah, we did.
- Yeah. Shit went national.


1318
00:55:47.771 --> 00:55:48.813
Yeah, I love that.

1319
00:55:48.813 --> 00:55:51.396
Thinking of getting me
a sweet kimono dragon.


1320
00:55:51.396 --> 00:55:53.480
Isn't it 'komodo'?

1321
00:55:53.480 --> 00:55:55.396
No, not the one
I'm getting, right?


1322
00:55:55.396 --> 00:55:57.730
- Oh, yeah!
-  Off market. All cash.


1323
00:55:57.730 --> 00:56:00.855
- What are you losers doing?
- We're playing a game


1324
00:56:00.855 --> 00:56:02.563
where if you catch
three peanuts in a row,


1325
00:56:02.563 --> 00:56:04.313
you get 20 bucks
from each of us.


1326
00:56:04.313 --> 00:56:05.355
Why, you want in?

1327
00:56:06.105 --> 00:56:07.646
- Fuck yeah!
- Oh?


1328
00:56:07.646 --> 00:56:09.230
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!
- Okay.


1329
00:56:09.230 --> 00:56:10.730
Man, I'll kick all your asses.

1330
00:56:10.730 --> 00:56:12.563
Step right up
and get behind the hat.


1331
00:56:12.563 --> 00:56:14.521
-  No cheating.
-  I got this.


1332
00:56:15.271 --> 00:56:16.563
- Here we go.
- You focused?


1333
00:56:17.646 --> 00:56:19.730
-  Whoa!
- Whoa! Boom!


1334
00:56:19.730 --> 00:56:20.896
Wow!

1335
00:56:20.896 --> 00:56:22.438
Relax, Gare.
Little bit of luck there.


1336
00:56:22.438 --> 00:56:23.521
- Okay.
-  Get low.


1337
00:56:25.521 --> 00:56:28.688
- Ohh! Yeah.
- Ohh! Yes!


1338
00:56:28.688 --> 00:56:30.730
I'm just as good as Wes
at catching nuts in my mouth.


1339
00:56:30.730 --> 00:56:32.813
Oh. Right. 'Cause I'm gay.

1340
00:56:32.813 --> 00:56:33.896
Yeah.

1341
00:56:33.896 --> 00:56:35.563
I'm so happy
we're doing this.


1342
00:56:36.146 --> 00:56:37.771
Okay, this one's
for all the marbles.


1343
00:56:37.771 --> 00:56:39.896
All right, Gary,
let's go, buddy. You ready?


1344
00:56:39.896 --> 00:56:41.730
Ready?
One, two...


1345
00:56:42.396 --> 00:56:44.313
Three...

1346
00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:08.480
Ba-doomp-pow! All net!

1347
00:57:11.146 --> 00:57:13.021
I think I ate a bad one.

1348
00:57:13.646 --> 00:57:14.813
Bitter.

1349
00:57:15.938 --> 00:57:17.480
My sweet boy.

1350
00:57:17.480 --> 00:57:20.980
May God make you
like Ephraim and Manasseh.


1351
00:57:20.980 --> 00:57:24.396
May God bless you
and watch over you.


1352
00:57:24.396 --> 00:57:26.146
Shouldn't we be stopping this?

1353
00:57:26.146 --> 00:57:29.063
Don't worry, we got about
a half hour before it kicks in.


1354
00:57:31.938 --> 00:57:34.480
Hey, I figured out
how I know him.


1355
00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:36.563
He's in those
Red Robin commercials.


1356
00:57:36.563 --> 00:57:39.771
"Seconds on steak fries?
Uh, yeah!"


1357
00:57:39.771 --> 00:57:41.688
Dude, that was great.
You should be an actor.


1358
00:57:41.688 --> 00:57:43.480
So you guys have
never met before?


1359
00:57:43.480 --> 00:57:45.646
- No, but...
- Yeah, just a big fan.


1360
00:57:48.938 --> 00:57:51.438
- All right, it's time.
- Okay.


1361
00:57:55.188 --> 00:57:57.521
Oh...

1362
00:57:57.521 --> 00:57:59.146
we're going to need
a steak knife.


1363
00:57:59.146 --> 00:58:00.188
Ha!

1364
00:58:01.355 --> 00:58:04.480
Wow! Is this his bris
or his bar mitzvah?


1365
00:58:05.646 --> 00:58:08.813
Okay, little vinegar...
Whitaker...


1366
00:58:09.855 --> 00:58:14.105
...has
skanctified us with the...


1367
00:58:14.896 --> 00:58:17.521
...commandiments...
com... condiments...


1368
00:58:18.605 --> 00:58:20.230
...comma... commandments...

1369
00:58:20.230 --> 00:58:22.146
With the commander-ments.

1370
00:58:22.146 --> 00:58:24.146
With the commandments. Oy...

1371
00:58:24.730 --> 00:58:27.063
-  He's seems confused.

1372
00:58:28.813 --> 00:58:30.938
What the hell?
Is he drunk?


1373
00:58:30.938 --> 00:58:33.563
I don't know.
I saw him eat a peanut earlier.


1374
00:58:33.563 --> 00:58:35.063
Maybe he's having a reaction?

1375
00:58:35.063 --> 00:58:36.813
- Man, you said half an hour.
- I don't know.


1376
00:58:36.813 --> 00:58:38.563
I think I might have
developed a tolerance.


1377
00:58:40.230 --> 00:58:41.480
Okay.

1378
00:58:42.771 --> 00:58:44.688
And he hasht given us

1379
00:58:44.688 --> 00:58:46.646
the command to...

1380
00:58:46.646 --> 00:58:47.938
circumvision!

1381
00:58:50.063 --> 00:58:53.313
Hi, fishy-fishy!
Oh, to fishy-fishy!


1382
00:58:53.313 --> 00:58:56.688
Mommy, I don't want to
go to school tomorrow.


1383
00:58:56.688 --> 00:58:58.271
Oh, my God!

1384
00:58:58.271 --> 00:59:00.105
Oh, my God!
He's allergic to peanuts.


1385
00:59:00.105 --> 00:59:01.313
What did she say?

1386
00:59:01.313 --> 00:59:03.188
She said
he's allergic to penis.


1387
00:59:03.188 --> 00:59:04.896
Oh, he's certainly in
the wrong business.


1388
00:59:04.896 --> 00:59:06.355
Ba-doomp-pow!

1389
00:59:06.355 --> 00:59:07.896
Oh, my God.

1390
00:59:07.896 --> 00:59:09.896
He's only half circumcised.

1391
00:59:09.896 --> 00:59:11.396
Take the kid to the hospital.

1392
00:59:11.396 --> 00:59:14.271
- Yes, definitely a hospital.
- I could call an ambulance.


1393
00:59:14.271 --> 00:59:16.021
No, this has to be done now.

1394
00:59:16.021 --> 00:59:17.646
Let Ricky finish it.

1395
00:59:17.646 --> 00:59:20.146
Ricky? What? No!
No. Are you insane?


1396
00:59:20.146 --> 00:59:22.313
He used to work for
Bono's foundation in Africa,


1397
00:59:22.313 --> 00:59:23.521
circumcising adults.

1398
00:59:23.521 --> 00:59:24.730
Aw.

1399
00:59:25.438 --> 00:59:28.938
Yeah, he did.
But that was so long ago.


1400
00:59:28.938 --> 00:59:30.938
Plus, it's got to be
way easier to circumcise


1401
00:59:30.938 --> 00:59:33.146
a gorgeous African penis
than a baby penis.


1402
00:59:33.146 --> 00:59:34.771
You would think.

1403
00:59:34.771 --> 00:59:36.146
I can do it.

1404
00:59:37.605 --> 00:59:40.855
Uh, Ricky... Ricky! This is
a baby we're talking about.


1405
00:59:40.855 --> 00:59:43.563
A real baby. Are you sure?

1406
00:59:43.563 --> 00:59:45.980
Yeah. Yeah. It's not like
I'm cutting a diamond.


1407
00:59:45.980 --> 00:59:49.730
I'm sure I can pull it off.
Pun intended.


1408
00:59:49.730 --> 00:59:52.480
No. No! We need
a certified mohel, right?


1409
00:59:52.480 --> 00:59:54.521
- Right.
- I'll just look one up on Yelp.


1410
00:59:54.521 --> 00:59:56.063
What? No! No Yelping.

1411
00:59:56.063 --> 00:59:59.188
No, we already have a mohel.
He's already said the tefilah.


1412
00:59:59.188 --> 01:00:01.688
We just need to
let Ricky finish it off.


1413
01:00:01.688 --> 01:00:03.730
Mom, no, I'm going to
take him to a hospital,


1414
01:00:03.730 --> 01:00:05.230
where doctors work.

1415
01:00:05.230 --> 01:00:07.146
Does anyone here care
that my grandson


1416
01:00:07.146 --> 01:00:09.271
is laying there
half circumcised?


1417
01:00:09.271 --> 01:00:11.105
And we're done!

1418
01:00:14.271 --> 01:00:15.980
Just a little
off the ol' Tiparillo.


1419
01:00:17.146 --> 01:00:18.563
- Huh.
-  Who's next?


1420
01:00:18.563 --> 01:00:20.813
Summerhayes, get over here so
I can snip off that turtleneck.


1421
01:00:20.813 --> 01:00:23.271
Stanicky, you are unbelievable.

1422
01:00:23.271 --> 01:00:26.021
- All right, this is yours.
- No.


1423
01:00:26.021 --> 01:00:29.146
Oh, my God, Ricky!

1424
01:00:35.730 --> 01:00:36.855
Yes!

1425
01:00:36.855 --> 01:00:39.896
Ricky Stanicky, you are even
better than advertized.


1426
01:00:39.896 --> 01:00:41.855
Ah, Susan, it's just
a pleasure to help you out.


1427
01:00:41.855 --> 01:00:44.188
By the way, the kid's got a
good-looking schmeckel on him.


1428
01:00:44.188 --> 01:00:46.355
Real hog barrel. He's going to
have some fun with that thing.


1429
01:00:47.355 --> 01:00:48.896
- Takes after his papa.
-  Yeah.


1430
01:00:48.896 --> 01:00:50.646
Ricky, do you really
have to leave already?


1431
01:00:50.646 --> 01:00:52.146
Can't you just stay
one more night?


1432
01:00:52.146 --> 01:00:54.438
I would love to, Carlsbad...

1433
01:00:55.521 --> 01:00:56.896
...but I got to go.

1434
01:00:56.896 --> 01:00:57.938
Aw...

1435
01:00:57.938 --> 01:01:00.438
He's going to Nairobi to help
out with the Ebola situation.


1436
01:01:00.438 --> 01:01:01.480
- Yeah.
- Oh.


1437
01:01:01.480 --> 01:01:02.480
Nairobi?

1438
01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:04.771
Yeah. I goes where I's needed.

1439
01:01:04.771 --> 01:01:05.938
Ricky! Ricky!

1440
01:01:05.938 --> 01:01:07.105
Those guys.

1441
01:01:09.271 --> 01:01:10.563
Well...

1442
01:01:13.313 --> 01:01:14.688
Oh, man.

1443
01:01:14.688 --> 01:01:16.313
- Okay, bye, Ricky.
-  One of a kind.


1444
01:01:16.313 --> 01:01:18.313
- I'll see you inside.
- I'll see you in a minute.


1445
01:01:18.313 --> 01:01:19.605
I'm going to help
with the baby.


1446
01:01:19.605 --> 01:01:20.646
Okay.

1447
01:01:23.271 --> 01:01:25.063
That was amazing. Incredible.

1448
01:01:25.063 --> 01:01:26.271
You are a legend.

1449
01:01:26.271 --> 01:01:28.271
That was world class, Rod.

1450
01:01:28.271 --> 01:01:29.313
It's Ricky.

1451
01:01:33.271 --> 01:01:35.396
- Yeah...
- Right.


1452
01:01:35.396 --> 01:01:37.480
Well, here's your dough.

1453
01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:38.813
Uh, we put some extra
in there


1454
01:01:38.813 --> 01:01:40.563
just 'cause you knocked it
out of the park, man.


1455
01:01:40.563 --> 01:01:41.563
- Yes you did.
- Yeah.


1456
01:01:41.563 --> 01:01:43.063
Where did you
learn to circumcise?


1457
01:01:43.063 --> 01:01:46.855
Oh, had a job peeling shrimp
at Beefsteak Charlie's.


1458
01:01:46.855 --> 01:01:48.688
Okay.

1459
01:01:50.521 --> 01:01:52.646
- Oh, you blowing up, huh?

1460
01:01:52.646 --> 01:01:54.188
Are you going to get that,
or...?


1461
01:01:55.480 --> 01:01:58.146
No. That's just a crazy fan.

1462
01:01:58.146 --> 01:01:59.730
Well, now you got
three crazy fans.


1463
01:01:59.730 --> 01:02:00.813
That's right.

1464
01:02:01.855 --> 01:02:03.146
You guys take care.

1465
01:02:03.146 --> 01:02:04.646
- You too!
- Yeah, you too.


1466
01:02:04.646 --> 01:02:06.480
- We'll be fine. You take care.
- Yeah, please.


1467
01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:08.105
If you're ever
in Atlantic City...


1468
01:02:08.105 --> 01:02:09.896
- Possibly.
- We'll let you know.


1469
01:02:09.896 --> 01:02:11.396
We'll definitely let you know.

1470
01:02:15.355 --> 01:02:16.855
He's good to go.

1471
01:02:16.855 --> 01:02:18.271
-  Thanks, Rod.
- Thank you.


1472
01:02:18.271 --> 01:02:19.521
It's Ricky.

1473
01:02:25.105 --> 01:02:27.188
-  Whew!
- Yeah!


1474
01:02:27.188 --> 01:02:29.146
- I'm hungry, man.
-  Let's feed you.


1475
01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:32.063
I can't believe
it worked!


1476
01:02:32.063 --> 01:02:34.438
I can't believe it actually
fucking worked.


1477
01:02:34.438 --> 01:02:35.980
As much of a nut job
as Rod is...


1478
01:02:35.980 --> 01:02:38.813
- Uh, it's Ricky.
- Oh, sorry, Ricky.


1479
01:02:39.896 --> 01:02:42.146
But he came through.
He actually came through.


1480
01:02:43.146 --> 01:02:44.438
So that's it, though, right?

1481
01:02:44.438 --> 01:02:45.896
- Yep.
- No more Ricky Stanicky.


1482
01:02:45.896 --> 01:02:48.313
No, we are never mentioning
his name ever again.


1483
01:02:48.313 --> 01:02:50.355
It was fun while it lasted.
Right? Okay.


1484
01:02:50.355 --> 01:02:53.396
But it's time to get off that
rollercoaster once and for all.


1485
01:02:53.396 --> 01:02:56.063
Yep. Ride's over, folks!
Please exit to your left!


1486
01:02:56.063 --> 01:02:57.646
Please check for
your belongings!


1487
01:02:57.646 --> 01:03:00.355
You gotta be this tall
to ride this ride.


1488
01:03:00.355 --> 01:03:02.188
Wes, you always do
one too many, man.


1489
01:03:02.188 --> 01:03:03.480
Fuck you. Is that one too many?

1490
01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:06.188
- Oh, it is. That is too many.
- Guys, guys, guys. Guys.


1491
01:03:06.188 --> 01:03:09.688
For the very last time,
a toast...


1492
01:03:09.688 --> 01:03:11.313
To Ricky Stanicky.

1493
01:03:11.313 --> 01:03:13.396
To Ricky Stanicky!

1494
01:03:13.396 --> 01:03:15.105
Best friend we never had.

1495
01:03:18.271 --> 01:03:20.313
- You got some on your arm.
- Hoo!


1496
01:03:22.230 --> 01:03:24.521
I mean, it's my
newborn son, you know,


1497
01:03:24.521 --> 01:03:26.063
it's like this bonding thing.

1498
01:03:26.063 --> 01:03:27.771
If anybody else
had pissed on me,


1499
01:03:27.771 --> 01:03:29.355
I'd be totally grossed out.

1500
01:03:29.355 --> 01:03:30.771
What about if it was Susan?

1501
01:03:30.771 --> 01:03:31.980
Eew!

1502
01:03:31.980 --> 01:03:35.063
Hey, guys, grab a cup of coffee
and get in here.


1503
01:03:35.980 --> 01:03:37.021
Yes!

1504
01:03:37.021 --> 01:03:39.396
Yesterday was a real kick.

1505
01:03:39.396 --> 01:03:41.105
It was nice spending time
with you guys


1506
01:03:41.105 --> 01:03:42.271
outside the boiler room.

1507
01:03:42.271 --> 01:03:43.521
- Mm-hm.
- It is.


1508
01:03:43.521 --> 01:03:45.021
Who doesn't love
a good bris, right?


1509
01:03:45.021 --> 01:03:47.313
Right!
We should do it all the time.


1510
01:03:47.980 --> 01:03:51.105
- Have a bris?
- Hang out. We should hang...


1511
01:03:51.105 --> 01:03:54.730
By the way, your wife, Miriam,
she's amazing.


1512
01:03:54.730 --> 01:03:57.271
- Just fantastic.
- A lovely, lovely woman.


1513
01:03:57.271 --> 01:03:59.980
Thanks. She liked you guys too.

1514
01:03:59.980 --> 01:04:03.146
And she was really taken
with your friend Stanicky.


1515
01:04:03.146 --> 01:04:06.771
He's got brass balls on him,
that guy.


1516
01:04:06.771 --> 01:04:08.563
She loved how
in my face he was.


1517
01:04:08.563 --> 01:04:09.605
Really?

1518
01:04:09.605 --> 01:04:11.438
Yeah, he'll give it to you,
man, that guy.


1519
01:04:11.438 --> 01:04:12.896
- That's Ricky.
- Yeah. He'll...


1520
01:04:12.896 --> 01:04:14.980
- Just... he's a character.
- He is a character.


1521
01:04:14.980 --> 01:04:17.146
- A powerful creature, man.
- He sure is.


1522
01:04:17.146 --> 01:04:18.646
That's why I hired him.

1523
01:04:18.646 --> 01:04:20.230
- Mm-hm.
- Awesome.


1524
01:04:20.230 --> 01:04:21.730
What the fuck
did you just say?


1525
01:04:22.855 --> 01:04:24.730
What the fuck
did you just say?


1526
01:04:25.771 --> 01:04:29.230
I just said, "Awesome."

1527
01:04:29.230 --> 01:04:30.730
That's awesome.

1528
01:04:30.730 --> 01:04:32.396
You just said...

1529
01:04:32.396 --> 01:04:34.188
What did you say?
Just say it one more time?


1530
01:04:34.188 --> 01:04:38.188
Ricky gave me his number and
when I got home, I called him.


1531
01:04:38.188 --> 01:04:40.146
I got him right before
he got on the plane too.


1532
01:04:40.146 --> 01:04:41.855
He came over to my place.

1533
01:04:41.855 --> 01:04:44.438
We were up till 4 a.m.
banging out a deal.


1534
01:04:44.438 --> 01:04:46.271
The buff guy?

1535
01:04:46.271 --> 01:04:48.355
The guy who wore the
safari outfit to my son's bris


1536
01:04:48.355 --> 01:04:49.980
and circumcised him
with a cigar cutter?


1537
01:04:49.980 --> 01:04:51.646
- You banged out a deal?
- Yes.


1538
01:04:51.646 --> 01:04:53.313
I hired Ricky Stanicky.

1539
01:04:53.938 --> 01:04:56.313
Wow! Wow!

1540
01:04:56.313 --> 01:04:59.480
But do you think...
like, he has the experience


1541
01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:01.563
- to be working here?
- Yeah, does he, ya think?


1542
01:05:01.563 --> 01:05:03.730
Nah, whatever he lacks
in experience,


1543
01:05:03.730 --> 01:05:07.563
he more than makes up for
with piss and vinegar.


1544
01:05:07.563 --> 01:05:10.230
I loved his take
on the World River deal.


1545
01:05:10.230 --> 01:05:12.063
- But that's...
- Not his take, really.


1546
01:05:12.063 --> 01:05:13.938
Yeah, that's just what he read
in the news.


1547
01:05:13.938 --> 01:05:15.063
Uh-huh.

1548
01:05:15.063 --> 01:05:17.688
You can stop
playing games, guys.


1549
01:05:17.688 --> 01:05:19.980
I know you've been
recruiting him.


1550
01:05:19.980 --> 01:05:21.480
You don't think I noticed

1551
01:05:21.480 --> 01:05:25.813
that JT expensed three rounds
of golf at Carnegie Abbey


1552
01:05:25.813 --> 01:05:27.480
in the last couple of months?

1553
01:05:29.396 --> 01:05:31.730
That was two rounds, I think...

1554
01:05:31.730 --> 01:05:33.730
B-because we were...
we were...


1555
01:05:33.730 --> 01:05:36.021
- We were recruiting him.
- Recruiting him.


1556
01:05:36.021 --> 01:05:37.521
And we decided...

1557
01:05:37.521 --> 01:05:39.396
- Not... not good.
- Not Summerhayes material.


1558
01:05:39.396 --> 01:05:40.605
Yeah, he just doesn't...

1559
01:05:40.605 --> 01:05:42.396
I don't think
he's right for this place.


1560
01:05:42.396 --> 01:05:44.355
Hey! Speak of the devil.

1561
01:05:52.771 --> 01:05:53.771
Okay.

1562
01:05:53.771 --> 01:05:54.855
- Oh, Philip.
- Yeah?


1563
01:05:54.855 --> 01:05:58.146
I was hoping to see something
in a mahogany or a birch.


1564
01:05:58.146 --> 01:06:02.313
I believe this is Carolina
pine. That's a shit wood.


1565
01:06:03.063 --> 01:06:05.646
Okay. Uh... shit wood...

1566
01:06:05.646 --> 01:06:07.021
Philip, can we have a sec?

1567
01:06:07.021 --> 01:06:08.563
Yes. Please.

1568
01:06:09.313 --> 01:06:11.271
Oh, and for these walls,

1569
01:06:11.271 --> 01:06:14.271
I'd love to see something
in more of a ham color.


1570
01:06:15.146 --> 01:06:16.771
Right.

1571
01:06:19.688 --> 01:06:21.688
What the fuck do you think
you're doing here?


1572
01:06:21.688 --> 01:06:24.146
This is unbelievable.
How cool is this, right?


1573
01:06:24.146 --> 01:06:26.146
And I didn't even have to
fill out an application!


1574
01:06:26.146 --> 01:06:28.521
Application?!
This isn't Little Caesar's.


1575
01:06:28.521 --> 01:06:31.313
There's no way for you to act
your way through this, okay?


1576
01:06:31.313 --> 01:06:33.521
There's no script for you
to follow here.


1577
01:06:33.521 --> 01:06:35.355
Okay, you guys can help me out.

1578
01:06:35.355 --> 01:06:37.480
Just like I helped you out
in the bris thing, right?


1579
01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:40.063
- That's what friends are for.
- Friends? We're not friends!


1580
01:06:40.063 --> 01:06:42.230
The deal was you come to
the gig, then you leave.


1581
01:06:42.230 --> 01:06:43.313
You got paid.

1582
01:06:43.313 --> 01:06:44.480
- Now go!
- Go!


1583
01:06:44.480 --> 01:06:46.896
Come on.
What was I supposed to do?


1584
01:06:46.896 --> 01:06:48.396
Your boss, Summersquash,
hits me up


1585
01:06:48.396 --> 01:06:50.021
- and he's like, "Hey, man."
- 'Summerhayes'?


1586
01:06:50.021 --> 01:06:51.521
Yes, that guy.

1587
01:06:51.521 --> 01:06:53.896
Offers me 250 large
right out of the blue.


1588
01:06:53.896 --> 01:06:56.688
- What?!
- $250,000?


1589
01:06:56.688 --> 01:06:58.313
Yeah, but that's
for the whole year.


1590
01:06:58.313 --> 01:06:59.771
That's more than we make.

1591
01:06:59.771 --> 01:07:00.896
Oh, my God!

1592
01:07:00.896 --> 01:07:03.438
Well, I did work as a hostage
negotiator in Somalia.


1593
01:07:03.438 --> 01:07:05.521
So maybe I bring a certain
amount of life experience


1594
01:07:05.521 --> 01:07:06.521
to the table.

1595
01:07:06.521 --> 01:07:08.730
I mean, come on, guys,
didn't you read the bible?


1596
01:07:08.730 --> 01:07:11.605
- We wrote the fucking bible!
- We did that.


1597
01:07:11.605 --> 01:07:13.771
Rod, I need you to listen
to me very, very carefully.


1598
01:07:13.771 --> 01:07:15.146
It's 'Ricky'.

1599
01:07:15.146 --> 01:07:17.938
Rod! Listen to me, okay?

1600
01:07:17.938 --> 01:07:21.605
There's no way
that this ends well. All right?


1601
01:07:21.605 --> 01:07:23.938
You don't even know
what we do here.


1602
01:07:23.938 --> 01:07:25.605
It's like business stuff.

1603
01:07:25.605 --> 01:07:27.563
You guys are like...
like bookies, right?


1604
01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:29.896
We're not bookies.

1605
01:07:29.896 --> 01:07:32.813
Well, when you boil it down
a little bit, there is...


1606
01:07:32.813 --> 01:07:35.438
It's way more complex
than that, okay?


1607
01:07:36.105 --> 01:07:38.896
Dean, Erin's in your office.
She says it's urgent.


1608
01:07:43.313 --> 01:07:44.313
Hey.

1609
01:07:44.813 --> 01:07:46.521
They hired me!

1610
01:07:46.521 --> 01:07:48.021
- Who?
- MFMBC!


1611
01:07:48.021 --> 01:07:50.105
They want me to produce
the 'Hero of the Week' segment.


1612
01:07:50.105 --> 01:07:52.355
- MFMBC?
- Yes!


1613
01:07:52.355 --> 01:07:53.855
Are you kidding me? What?!

1614
01:07:53.855 --> 01:07:56.813
- Oh, my gosh! Oh.

1615
01:07:56.813 --> 01:07:59.021
- Oh, I'm so proud of you.
- Thank you.


1616
01:07:59.021 --> 01:08:00.813
Didn't I tell you you were
going to get your big break?


1617
01:08:00.813 --> 01:08:02.480
- You did, you did.
- You got your big break.


1618
01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:04.438
You did. I pushed them
the Ricky Stanicky story


1619
01:08:04.438 --> 01:08:05.896
and they loved it.

1620
01:08:05.896 --> 01:08:07.605
The Ricky what?

1621
01:08:07.605 --> 01:08:09.105
The 'Hero of the Week' segment.

1622
01:08:09.105 --> 01:08:11.105
I sent them a proposal
about the work Ricky does


1623
01:08:11.105 --> 01:08:13.396
in Africa, in South America
and how he works with Bono...


1624
01:08:13.396 --> 01:08:15.313
...and helped
clean up the oil spill


1625
01:08:15.313 --> 01:08:18.105
in the Chesapeake Bay,
and they want me to produce it!


1626
01:08:18.605 --> 01:08:20.938
- Oh!
-"Oh"?


1627
01:08:21.646 --> 01:08:23.021
What's wrong with your face?

1628
01:08:23.021 --> 01:08:26.646
This is my happy face.
I'm so... I'm happy.


1629
01:08:26.646 --> 01:08:28.855
I'm ha... I'm happy.

1630
01:08:28.855 --> 01:08:31.521
Great. Because we got to
get him back here now.


1631
01:08:31.521 --> 01:08:33.438
They want me
to run it this week.


1632
01:08:33.438 --> 01:08:34.771
Right.

1633
01:08:34.771 --> 01:08:38.271
I don't know if that's
going to be... possible.


1634
01:08:38.271 --> 01:08:40.521
I don't...
There's just a lot of, uh...


1635
01:08:40.521 --> 01:08:42.688
-  More of a canned ham.
- A lot of moving...


1636
01:08:42.688 --> 01:08:44.313
- Very close to spam.
-  Ricky?


1637
01:08:44.313 --> 01:08:45.563
Ricky!

1638
01:08:46.688 --> 01:08:47.813
Ricky!

1639
01:08:47.813 --> 01:08:50.938
Man of the Year?
Wow! That's so cool!


1640
01:08:50.938 --> 01:08:53.021
It's not man of the year.
It's hero of the week.


1641
01:08:53.021 --> 01:08:55.480
And it's not wow.
It's a fucking shit show.


1642
01:08:55.480 --> 01:08:56.521
And on top of that,

1643
01:08:56.521 --> 01:08:58.355
the girls are going bowling
with him tonight.


1644
01:08:58.355 --> 01:09:00.521
- Do we have to go?
- Of course we have to go.


1645
01:09:00.521 --> 01:09:03.313
We're the dipshit's
best friends, remember?


1646
01:09:04.146 --> 01:09:06.063
Plus we can't let that fucker
out of our sight.


1647
01:09:06.063 --> 01:09:07.563
There's no telling
what he'll say.


1648
01:09:07.563 --> 01:09:11.563
You know, on the bright side,
it is pretty remarkable that,


1649
01:09:11.563 --> 01:09:14.771
you know, we invented a man
who can win an award like this.


1650
01:09:14.771 --> 01:09:16.063
Hey, you think he'll thank us?

1651
01:09:16.063 --> 01:09:18.730
Are you fucking serious
right now?


1652
01:09:18.730 --> 01:09:21.230
Wes! You are smoking
way too much weed


1653
01:09:21.230 --> 01:09:23.771
if you don't understand
how serious this is, okay?


1654
01:09:23.771 --> 01:09:25.896
It's not just about us anymore.

1655
01:09:25.896 --> 01:09:29.980
This could destroy
Erin's career. Wake up!


1656
01:09:33.480 --> 01:09:34.980
I don't have a choice.

1657
01:09:35.646 --> 01:09:37.480
- I got to tell her the truth.
- No fucking way!


1658
01:09:37.480 --> 01:09:39.230
- I got to.
- Dean, no. Dude!


1659
01:09:39.230 --> 01:09:42.021
If you tell Erin,
she'll tell Susan. Okay?


1660
01:09:42.021 --> 01:09:43.646
Then what do you think
is going to happen?


1661
01:09:43.646 --> 01:09:45.146
Not only did I miss
the birth of my son,


1662
01:09:45.146 --> 01:09:47.063
but I let some porno
Peter Frampton impersonator


1663
01:09:47.063 --> 01:09:48.855
snip his dick
with a cigar cutter.


1664
01:09:48.855 --> 01:09:50.188
No!

1665
01:09:52.396 --> 01:09:53.480
Hey, guys.

1666
01:09:54.355 --> 01:09:55.563
Hey, Karnowski.

1667
01:09:55.563 --> 01:09:57.230
How was the Rebillet show?

1668
01:09:57.230 --> 01:09:59.938
It was great, you piece of
shit. Thanks for the tickets.


1669
01:09:59.938 --> 01:10:01.396
Thank you!

1670
01:10:03.563 --> 01:10:05.271
Shitbag!

1671
01:10:07.438 --> 01:10:09.146
He doesn't deserve that.
Karnowsk!


1672
01:10:10.730 --> 01:10:12.188
Karnowski!

1673
01:10:19.688 --> 01:10:21.563
You'll never pick it up.

1674
01:10:24.646 --> 01:10:26.646
I like your form.

1675
01:10:29.313 --> 01:10:32.396
I mean, look at this guy.
Not a care in the world.


1676
01:10:32.396 --> 01:10:34.396
If he mentions his salary
one more time,


1677
01:10:34.396 --> 01:10:36.146
I'm going to hit him
in the fucking head.


1678
01:10:36.146 --> 01:10:37.730
Well, maybe if you gave him
more money


1679
01:10:37.730 --> 01:10:39.396
than he's being paid,
he'd leave.


1680
01:10:39.396 --> 01:10:41.938
He's getting paid $250,000,
Wes.


1681
01:10:41.938 --> 01:10:43.438
Yeah, but that's
for the whole year.


1682
01:10:43.438 --> 01:10:44.771
I'll just run to my bank, then.

1683
01:10:44.771 --> 01:10:47.521
We got to figure out a way to
get rid of him or we're done.


1684
01:10:47.521 --> 01:10:49.438
Look, maybe you're worried
about nothing, right?


1685
01:10:49.438 --> 01:10:51.563
She only has a couple of days
to dig up dirt.


1686
01:10:51.563 --> 01:10:54.063
If she doesn't dig up dirt,
that's worse.


1687
01:10:54.063 --> 01:10:56.105
Eventually someone's
going to find out the truth.


1688
01:10:56.105 --> 01:10:58.188
And then Erin would just
be one of those journalists


1689
01:10:58.188 --> 01:11:00.021
that makes up fake stories.

1690
01:11:00.021 --> 01:11:02.355
Yeah, like Mario Lopez.

1691
01:11:03.396 --> 01:11:04.521
Oh.

1692
01:11:04.521 --> 01:11:07.063
Well,
look who's hitting it off.


1693
01:11:07.688 --> 01:11:10.271
I thought she was
with Gary Polisner.


1694
01:11:10.271 --> 01:11:12.188
Apparently not.

1695
01:11:12.188 --> 01:11:14.563
Hey, look,
none of my business,


1696
01:11:14.563 --> 01:11:17.355
but you should think about
chopping that off.


1697
01:11:17.938 --> 01:11:19.896
What? A haircut?

1698
01:11:19.896 --> 01:11:23.521
No, I don't know,
I mean, I'd be afraid to.


1699
01:11:23.521 --> 01:11:26.521
Why? With a face like yours,
you should have a pixie.


1700
01:11:26.521 --> 01:11:28.563
- Really?
- Yes! Look at this.


1701
01:11:29.896 --> 01:11:31.188
Okay...

1702
01:11:32.771 --> 01:11:34.146
Maybe not.

1703
01:11:34.855 --> 01:11:36.855
Down to the shoulders,
maybe mid back.


1704
01:11:37.813 --> 01:11:39.730
Yeah, I mean, yeah...

1705
01:11:39.730 --> 01:11:43.063
Honestly, I've kind of been
wanting to cut it for a while,


1706
01:11:43.063 --> 01:11:45.438
but I just feel like
this is like my thing now,


1707
01:11:45.438 --> 01:11:47.063
and everyone says
that they love it.


1708
01:11:47.063 --> 01:11:48.521
They're just being nice.

1709
01:11:49.980 --> 01:11:51.646
What, really?

1710
01:11:51.646 --> 01:11:53.146
Oh, yeah. Trust me.

1711
01:11:55.271 --> 01:11:57.938
But why would they lie to me?

1712
01:11:57.938 --> 01:12:01.521
I don't know.
People are weird, right?


1713
01:12:02.146 --> 01:12:03.730
Maybe it's hard for them
to tell you


1714
01:12:03.730 --> 01:12:05.896
you look like a freaking loon.

1715
01:12:09.730 --> 01:12:12.813
Hey, Carly, whoa.

1716
01:12:12.813 --> 01:12:16.105
Look, I love your hair.
All right?


1717
01:12:16.105 --> 01:12:17.521
What I was trying to say was,

1718
01:12:17.521 --> 01:12:19.230
if you want to cut it,
you should.


1719
01:12:19.230 --> 01:12:21.521
You shouldn't care about
what anybody else thinks.


1720
01:12:22.105 --> 01:12:23.646
Look at you.

1721
01:12:23.646 --> 01:12:27.063
You're smart, you're sweet.

1722
01:12:27.063 --> 01:12:29.188
You got that cute
little muskrat face.


1723
01:12:30.021 --> 01:12:32.813
But all anybody can ever see
is your insane...


1724
01:12:32.813 --> 01:12:34.688
...ly beautiful hair.

1725
01:12:36.521 --> 01:12:39.563
Which is like the tenth best
thing you got going for you.


1726
01:12:42.313 --> 01:12:44.688
- Agh! Ricky! Ricky!

1727
01:12:45.313 --> 01:12:47.896
Oh, what's happening? Ricky,
Ricky, what's happening?


1728
01:12:54.605 --> 01:12:55.855
What's happen...? Ow!

1729
01:12:57.896 --> 01:13:00.188
Hey! Stop fucking bowling!

1730
01:13:06.646 --> 01:13:08.438
What just happened?

1731
01:13:08.938 --> 01:13:10.813
Oh, Carly,
that was terrible.


1732
01:13:11.313 --> 01:13:13.396
Moron!
He almost took her head off.


1733
01:13:13.396 --> 01:13:14.980
That's it. He's done.

1734
01:13:14.980 --> 01:13:17.146
I'll gladly pay 250, 300,
whatever it costs.


1735
01:13:17.146 --> 01:13:19.521
I'll get a loan, sell a kidney.
Whatever it takes.


1736
01:13:19.521 --> 01:13:20.563
He's out of here!

1737
01:13:21.730 --> 01:13:23.313
Wait a minute.

1738
01:13:23.313 --> 01:13:26.188
What if he didn't have a job
that paid him 250 grand a year?


1739
01:13:28.063 --> 01:13:29.938
Like, if he got fired.

1740
01:13:35.146 --> 01:13:36.688
Let's face facts.

1741
01:13:36.688 --> 01:13:40.230
We need this merger
with World River,


1742
01:13:40.230 --> 01:13:42.313
and they seem to be able
to take it or leave it.


1743
01:13:42.313 --> 01:13:44.980
Why? Well, I'll tell you why.

1744
01:13:44.980 --> 01:13:47.021
Those folks are
from San Francisco


1745
01:13:47.021 --> 01:13:49.938
and we're an old-money
New England company.


1746
01:13:49.938 --> 01:13:52.730
They think we're dinosaurs.

1747
01:13:52.730 --> 01:13:54.313
They're looking for new,

1748
01:13:54.313 --> 01:13:56.688
they're looking
for progressive.


1749
01:13:56.688 --> 01:13:59.771
So, come on.
Let's hear some ideas.


1750
01:13:59.771 --> 01:14:02.813
Dean, you're point on this.
Why don't you get us started?


1751
01:14:02.813 --> 01:14:04.313
Actually,
I was thinking that Ricky


1752
01:14:04.313 --> 01:14:06.063
should take point on this
today.


1753
01:14:06.063 --> 01:14:08.730
He's our newest employee
and he's an 'eco-hero'.


1754
01:14:08.730 --> 01:14:11.521
I like that idea.
Ricky, what do you got?


1755
01:14:12.146 --> 01:14:14.396
Well, thank you for
the vote of confidence, Dean.


1756
01:14:14.396 --> 01:14:15.938
You should run the meeting,
for sure.


1757
01:14:15.938 --> 01:14:17.855
I am just
not quite up to speed.


1758
01:14:17.855 --> 01:14:18.896
Well, that makes sense.

1759
01:14:18.896 --> 01:14:20.771
But Ricky's got something
big worked out here.


1760
01:14:20.771 --> 01:14:23.896
What'd you call it?
Um... game changer, right?


1761
01:14:23.896 --> 01:14:28.146
Game changer. Got to love that.
Ricky, what do you got?


1762
01:14:28.146 --> 01:14:29.688
I, um...

1763
01:14:29.688 --> 01:14:30.980
I, er...

1764
01:14:30.980 --> 01:14:34.980
Rick, I have a lunch
in 23 minutes.


1765
01:14:36.521 --> 01:14:38.105
Yeah.

1766
01:14:40.938 --> 01:14:42.688
Okay.

1767
01:14:43.480 --> 01:14:44.896
Um...

1768
01:14:45.730 --> 01:14:49.063
My area of expertize is in
non-profit humanitarian work.


1769
01:14:49.063 --> 01:14:51.021
In short, I'm a world hugger.

1770
01:14:51.730 --> 01:14:54.563
So, you know, why don't we
bring my exciting background


1771
01:14:54.563 --> 01:14:57.688
to the boring-ass world
of investment products?


1772
01:14:57.688 --> 01:15:00.021
I mean, you know,
ladies and gentlemen,


1773
01:15:00.021 --> 01:15:02.980
does for-profit
have to be for profit?


1774
01:15:02.980 --> 01:15:05.438
Well, that's the general idea.

1775
01:15:06.938 --> 01:15:08.021
Correct!

1776
01:15:08.021 --> 01:15:10.480
Ten points to the gentleman
in the conservative grey suit.


1777
01:15:10.980 --> 01:15:14.980
Er, could you please elaborate?

1778
01:15:20.771 --> 01:15:22.271
What I was saying...

1779
01:15:23.271 --> 01:15:25.146
...was, what if we took
all the money we made


1780
01:15:25.146 --> 01:15:28.355
and gave it away to poor people
and shit?


1781
01:15:29.688 --> 01:15:32.730
I'm not sure I understand that.

1782
01:15:32.730 --> 01:15:35.605
- And shit.
- I know I don't.


1783
01:15:35.605 --> 01:15:38.063
Well, think about it.

1784
01:15:38.063 --> 01:15:41.480
If we became, um, like
the Paul-Newman-salad-dressing


1785
01:15:41.480 --> 01:15:43.146
of banks,

1786
01:15:43.146 --> 01:15:45.313
the whole world would like us.

1787
01:15:45.313 --> 01:15:48.396
That is the stupidest idea
I've ever heard.


1788
01:15:49.938 --> 01:15:51.938
Well, now, wait a minute.

1789
01:15:51.938 --> 01:15:53.771
Read between the lines,
Billings.


1790
01:15:53.771 --> 01:15:56.521
This is exactly what
I've been talking about.


1791
01:15:56.521 --> 01:15:59.688
Stanicky's saying
we got to shake things up.


1792
01:15:59.688 --> 01:16:00.896
Try something different.

1793
01:16:00.896 --> 01:16:02.771
No, that's not what
he's saying. He's saying...


1794
01:16:02.771 --> 01:16:04.646
What about that
Tom's company?


1795
01:16:04.646 --> 01:16:08.438
Giving away a free pair
of shoes for every pair sold.


1796
01:16:08.438 --> 01:16:11.105
I bet that sounded like
a stupid idea at first.


1797
01:16:11.105 --> 01:16:12.980
And what are they clearing?

1798
01:16:12.980 --> 01:16:16.188
170 million in revenue
last year.


1799
01:16:16.188 --> 01:16:19.188
170 million. That's impressive.

1800
01:16:19.980 --> 01:16:21.980
Now, obviously, we can't
give away all our money,


1801
01:16:21.980 --> 01:16:26.730
but we could funnel some of it
into philanthropic ventures.


1802
01:16:26.730 --> 01:16:29.355
And there have got to be
tax incentives.


1803
01:16:29.355 --> 01:16:32.521
- Yeah! Tax shit.
- Yeah.


1804
01:16:32.521 --> 01:16:34.938
We could call it, um...
Feel-Good Investing.


1805
01:16:34.938 --> 01:16:37.063
We'll show people
we're a company that cares.


1806
01:16:37.980 --> 01:16:42.813
Feel-Good Investing.
I like that. Great work, Rick.


1807
01:16:42.813 --> 01:16:44.646
Thanks, Ted.

1808
01:16:47.271 --> 01:16:48.771
What did you say, Ricky?

1809
01:16:49.438 --> 01:16:52.105
Oh... nothing.

1810
01:16:52.105 --> 01:16:54.855
I was just saying
"fuck you" to that guy.


1811
01:16:58.355 --> 01:17:00.188
Yeah, fuck you, Billings!

1812
01:17:06.146 --> 01:17:07.896
We're just kidding.

1813
01:17:07.896 --> 01:17:09.271
But fuck you, Billings.

1814
01:17:12.313 --> 01:17:13.896
Here's what we're going to do.

1815
01:17:13.896 --> 01:17:16.355
The World River folks are
flying in Wednesday afternoon.


1816
01:17:16.355 --> 01:17:18.313
Wednesday? What?
Why Wednesday?


1817
01:17:18.313 --> 01:17:19.480
Because Wednesday night

1818
01:17:19.480 --> 01:17:21.563
we're going to have
a little summit over at my club


1819
01:17:21.563 --> 01:17:24.146
and watch Ricky's
'Hero of the Week' segment.


1820
01:17:24.146 --> 01:17:25.563
Clubs ahoy!

1821
01:17:26.855 --> 01:17:28.063
Right.

1822
01:17:28.063 --> 01:17:31.021
Now, I want you to bring
your families and your A-games.


1823
01:17:31.021 --> 01:17:33.646
Wednesday, we're going to show
these people who we are.


1824
01:17:33.646 --> 01:17:36.646
We're modern, we're fun,
we're socially conscious,


1825
01:17:36.646 --> 01:17:39.605
and we're American heroes.

1826
01:17:41.896 --> 01:17:43.563
- What is happening right now?
- I don't know.


1827
01:17:43.563 --> 01:17:45.730
I feel like Jason Bateman
in every episode of 'Ozark'.


1828
01:17:46.355 --> 01:17:48.938
Hey, boss-man?
Er, got a minute?


1829
01:17:48.938 --> 01:17:50.438
Sure!

1830
01:17:55.021 --> 01:17:57.146
Dean! JT! What it do?

1831
01:17:57.146 --> 01:17:59.521
What the...?
What are you doing here?


1832
01:17:59.521 --> 01:18:00.980
Ricky hired me.

1833
01:18:01.855 --> 01:18:03.563
- To do what?
- I don't know.


1834
01:18:03.563 --> 01:18:05.105
Help him out with stuff,
I guess.


1835
01:18:05.105 --> 01:18:07.146
Yes, I think young Wesley
shows great promise


1836
01:18:07.146 --> 01:18:08.355
as my attaché.

1837
01:18:08.355 --> 01:18:10.438
- Who's your attaché, Dean?
- I don't have an attaché.


1838
01:18:10.438 --> 01:18:11.688
I'm not a foreign diplomat.

1839
01:18:11.688 --> 01:18:13.980
Listen, you and me
need to have a chat.


1840
01:18:13.980 --> 01:18:16.105
Okay, but before we do,
I want to show you something.


1841
01:18:21.396 --> 01:18:23.813
First, thank you
for having faith


1842
01:18:23.813 --> 01:18:25.355
and believing in me today.

1843
01:18:25.355 --> 01:18:27.438
I never would've come up with
those ideas in the meeting


1844
01:18:27.438 --> 01:18:28.855
if you hadn't thrown me
into the fire.


1845
01:18:28.855 --> 01:18:30.146
Happy to do it, man.

1846
01:18:30.146 --> 01:18:32.563
I think I figured out
what the problem is.


1847
01:18:33.438 --> 01:18:34.688
What problem?

1848
01:18:34.688 --> 01:18:37.188
The whole 'not getting
the merger' thingy problem.


1849
01:18:37.188 --> 01:18:38.438
You went to one staff meeting

1850
01:18:38.438 --> 01:18:40.105
and you've got
the whole company figured out?


1851
01:18:40.105 --> 01:18:42.688
So I filmed this on my phone in
the staff meeting this morning


1852
01:18:42.688 --> 01:18:44.230
and my attaché
put it on the computer.


1853
01:18:44.230 --> 01:18:46.063
So, check it out.

1854
01:18:46.063 --> 01:18:48.688
- ...San Francisco and we...
-  See?


1855
01:18:48.688 --> 01:18:50.771
- ...old-money New England...
- You see?


1856
01:18:50.771 --> 01:18:53.521
- They're looking for...
- See what?


1857
01:18:53.521 --> 01:18:55.480
The guy's
a world-class air-dicker.


1858
01:18:55.480 --> 01:18:57.646
An air what-er?
What are you talking about?


1859
01:18:57.646 --> 01:18:59.188
Keep watching.

1860
01:18:59.188 --> 01:19:00.813
Every time
he tries to make a point,


1861
01:19:00.813 --> 01:19:03.563
it's like he puts an
invisible penis in his mouth.


1862
01:19:03.563 --> 01:19:05.730
Remember when Obama
used to power knuckle


1863
01:19:05.730 --> 01:19:06.855
to try to make that point?

1864
01:19:06.855 --> 01:19:08.521
Well, Summerhayes
does the same thing,


1865
01:19:08.521 --> 01:19:10.605
but when he does it, it's like
he's smoking invisible dongs.


1866
01:19:10.605 --> 01:19:13.688
Oh, my God,
he is an air-dicker.


1867
01:19:13.688 --> 01:19:15.063
There's a time
and a place for it,


1868
01:19:15.063 --> 01:19:16.688
but it's really hard
to get away with it


1869
01:19:16.688 --> 01:19:17.980
in a business setting.

1870
01:19:18.938 --> 01:19:21.355
Yo, let's make
a TikTok out of this!


1871
01:19:22.771 --> 01:19:25.605
What do you guys think?
Should I tell him?


1872
01:19:25.605 --> 01:19:27.146
Tell him what?

1873
01:19:27.646 --> 01:19:29.646
That he's a world-class
air-dicker.


1874
01:19:32.271 --> 01:19:34.355
- Absolutely.
- Yeah, you should.


1875
01:19:46.980 --> 01:19:48.480
How could you work for him, dude?

1876
01:19:48.480 --> 01:19:50.188
We don't need you
exploring career opportunities


1877
01:19:50.188 --> 01:19:51.605
when he's trying
to ruin our lives.


1878
01:19:51.605 --> 01:19:53.438
First of all,
he's not ruining my life.


1879
01:19:53.438 --> 01:19:55.438
He hired me 'cause
he actually gives a shit.


1880
01:19:55.438 --> 01:19:57.105
If I didn't get off my ass
and get a job,


1881
01:19:57.105 --> 01:19:58.605
Keith was going to dump me.

1882
01:19:58.605 --> 01:20:00.605
By the way, I noticed that
my so-called real friends


1883
01:20:00.605 --> 01:20:01.980
never offered me a job.

1884
01:20:01.980 --> 01:20:04.480
Are you fucking shitting me?!

1885
01:20:08.646 --> 01:20:10.271
You two!

1886
01:20:10.271 --> 01:20:12.271
In here, now!

1887
01:20:18.980 --> 01:20:20.605
Come in, sit down.

1888
01:20:23.063 --> 01:20:25.021
Show them what you showed me.

1889
01:20:25.688 --> 01:20:27.396
I already did, Ted.

1890
01:20:28.938 --> 01:20:31.396
You knew about this
and you never said anything?


1891
01:20:32.480 --> 01:20:33.813
Well, we just thought it was...

1892
01:20:33.813 --> 01:20:36.605
It's just a mannerism. It's
really not that big of a deal.


1893
01:20:36.605 --> 01:20:38.188
Especially
in this day and age.


1894
01:20:38.188 --> 01:20:39.730
I know it's not a big deal!

1895
01:20:39.730 --> 01:20:41.896
Two of my sons are gay,
for Christ's sake!


1896
01:20:41.896 --> 01:20:44.605
And the third one's just...
working it out.


1897
01:20:44.605 --> 01:20:48.105
But I can't go into
meetings like this.


1898
01:20:48.105 --> 01:20:50.938
No wonder they're not
interested in the merger.


1899
01:20:50.938 --> 01:20:52.355
They're so flippin' distracted,

1900
01:20:52.355 --> 01:20:54.188
they haven't heard
a word I've said.


1901
01:20:54.188 --> 01:20:57.896
We don't know that you've been
doing this everywhere. I...


1902
01:20:57.896 --> 01:21:00.271
As far as we know, you just
did it in today's meeting.


1903
01:21:00.271 --> 01:21:01.480
I'd never seen it before.

1904
01:21:02.355 --> 01:21:03.980
- Really?

1905
01:21:03.980 --> 01:21:05.813
I've got the conference link.

1906
01:21:07.771 --> 01:21:11.146
This merger will allow us

1907
01:21:11.146 --> 01:21:15.313
to further enhance
our capital efficiencies.


1908
01:21:15.813 --> 01:21:17.105
- Look at you.
- Oh, God...


1909
01:21:17.105 --> 01:21:18.605
Air-dicking left and right.

1910
01:21:18.605 --> 01:21:22.230
There are companies out there
who want to get bigger.


1911
01:21:22.230 --> 01:21:25.271
There are companies out
there who want to get smaller.


1912
01:21:25.271 --> 01:21:27.230
You just air-dicked four times
in ten seconds.


1913
01:21:27.230 --> 01:21:28.730
Oh, dear God, it's true.

1914
01:21:28.730 --> 01:21:33.813
On the other hand,
to support everything we do...


1915
01:21:33.813 --> 01:21:36.980
Oh, God! Now it looks like
I'm cupping the balls.


1916
01:21:36.980 --> 01:21:39.980
...with knowledge and planning.

1917
01:21:39.980 --> 01:21:41.771
Oh!

1918
01:21:41.771 --> 01:21:44.021
Hey, you're double-dongin' it.

1919
01:21:44.021 --> 01:21:47.480
...is the company
that can do both.


1920
01:21:48.021 --> 01:21:49.855
Oh, God. Get it... Turn it off.

1921
01:21:49.855 --> 01:21:51.396
- Some people say...

1922
01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:56.980
Okay, from this point forward

1923
01:21:56.980 --> 01:21:59.063
Stanicky is in charge
of the merger.


1924
01:21:59.063 --> 01:22:01.271
What? Ted, come on.

1925
01:22:01.271 --> 01:22:02.980
I've been running point on this
for nine months.


1926
01:22:02.980 --> 01:22:05.855
Yeah, and look where
it's gotten us.


1927
01:22:05.855 --> 01:22:07.896
He's been here one day and...

1928
01:22:07.896 --> 01:22:10.313
- Watch the air-dicking, Ted.
- Jesus...!


1929
01:22:11.730 --> 01:22:13.230
Here's the bottom line.

1930
01:22:13.813 --> 01:22:15.813
Stanicky gives it
to me straight,


1931
01:22:15.813 --> 01:22:17.646
whether the news
is good or bad.


1932
01:22:17.646 --> 01:22:20.730
He's in charge.
End of discussion.


1933
01:22:24.271 --> 01:22:28.230
Oh, Jesus. Okay,
just make it go away. Just...


1934
01:22:28.230 --> 01:22:29.980
- Yep.
- Go to black.


1935
01:22:29.980 --> 01:22:31.480
- Oh, er...
- Just go to black.


1936
01:22:31.480 --> 01:22:33.855
Yeah,
I'm pressing it but it's not...


1937
01:22:33.855 --> 01:22:35.230
- Give it to me.
- Yeah, try...


1938
01:22:35.230 --> 01:22:36.605
I don't know how
to work this thing.


1939
01:22:36.605 --> 01:22:38.646
- No, I know.
- Is there an IT guy?


1940
01:22:38.646 --> 01:22:40.605
- That's me.
- Argh, fuck!


1941
01:22:42.396 --> 01:22:44.813
Oh, Dean...

1942
01:22:44.813 --> 01:22:46.521
Despite what Ted said
back there,


1943
01:22:46.521 --> 01:22:47.688
about me being in charge,

1944
01:22:47.688 --> 01:22:49.896
I don't pretend to know more
about this company than you.


1945
01:22:49.896 --> 01:22:51.813
Well, I pretend
to know more than you,


1946
01:22:51.813 --> 01:22:53.396
but you are clearly

1947
01:22:53.396 --> 01:22:55.313
more informed
in company matters than me


1948
01:22:55.313 --> 01:22:58.355
and right now
I need your expertize.


1949
01:23:00.730 --> 01:23:02.146
What?

1950
01:23:02.146 --> 01:23:04.146
I don't want to forget this.
Okay...


1951
01:23:07.355 --> 01:23:09.480
How big of a raise
should I be asking for?


1952
01:23:11.480 --> 01:23:13.855
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

1953
01:23:16.021 --> 01:23:17.980
You're quitting! Today!

1954
01:23:18.730 --> 01:23:20.605
- What are you talking about?
- Show's over, Rod.


1955
01:23:20.605 --> 01:23:21.730
It's Ricky.

1956
01:23:21.730 --> 01:23:25.188
It's not Ricky, okay? Get it
through your head, man.


1957
01:23:25.188 --> 01:23:27.021
Ricky Stanicky isn't real.

1958
01:23:27.021 --> 01:23:29.063
Yes, he is. Here.

1959
01:23:34.271 --> 01:23:38.146
Richard Barbara Stanicky?

1960
01:23:38.146 --> 01:23:40.105
That's my grandmother's name.

1961
01:23:40.105 --> 01:23:41.980
Where the fuck
did you get this?


1962
01:23:44.438 --> 01:23:46.605
Officially changed my name.

1963
01:23:46.605 --> 01:23:49.230
Paid to expedite it online.
They overnighted it.


1964
01:23:49.896 --> 01:23:51.396
Oh, my God.

1965
01:23:51.396 --> 01:23:53.521
Come on, Dean.
See this from my side.


1966
01:23:53.521 --> 01:23:55.771
This is the role I was born
to play and I'm nailing it.


1967
01:23:55.771 --> 01:23:59.271
No, you were hired
under false pretences.


1968
01:23:59.271 --> 01:24:00.646
You lied to them.

1969
01:24:00.646 --> 01:24:02.105
No, as I recall, Dean,
you lied to them.


1970
01:24:02.105 --> 01:24:04.605
Oh, ha, ha, ha.
You got me there.


1971
01:24:04.605 --> 01:24:06.105
But you know what?
This is different.


1972
01:24:06.105 --> 01:24:07.646
You're putting
people's careers at risk.


1973
01:24:07.646 --> 01:24:09.188
Careers?

1974
01:24:09.188 --> 01:24:11.605
I've been here two days
and I'm your boss.


1975
01:24:11.605 --> 01:24:13.771
I'm talking about
Erin's career!


1976
01:24:13.771 --> 01:24:16.230
You can fool Summerhayes
with this righteous shit.


1977
01:24:16.230 --> 01:24:18.813
But I know who you really are.

1978
01:24:19.396 --> 01:24:22.730
You're Rock Hard Rod!
The drunk.


1979
01:24:26.480 --> 01:24:27.980
Yeah.

1980
01:24:30.188 --> 01:24:31.813
I was a drunk.

1981
01:24:32.813 --> 01:24:35.438
Nobody respected me. My job
sucked. I had no friends.


1982
01:24:36.355 --> 01:24:37.980
But now I have
all those things.


1983
01:24:37.980 --> 01:24:40.646
And I'm sober. All right?

1984
01:24:41.896 --> 01:24:43.938
And if I leave here,
it all goes away.


1985
01:24:47.980 --> 01:24:52.730
My whole life, all I've
ever been is a shit baby.


1986
01:24:55.896 --> 01:24:59.896
And now I get to be somebody
people actually like.


1987
01:25:03.313 --> 01:25:05.480
Don't take that away
from me, man. Please.


1988
01:25:13.355 --> 01:25:17.313
Look, this has to end.

1989
01:25:25.480 --> 01:25:28.063
What the fuck are you doing?
Stop! Stop! Hey, hey!


1990
01:25:28.063 --> 01:25:29.813
- Argh! Hey, okay!

1991
01:25:29.813 --> 01:25:32.355
If I go back, they'll kill me.
If I go back, they'll kill me.


1992
01:25:32.355 --> 01:25:33.563
What?!

1993
01:25:33.563 --> 01:25:35.396
If I go back to Atlantic City,
they'll kill me.


1994
01:25:35.396 --> 01:25:37.105
- Who?
- The Sasquatch


1995
01:25:37.105 --> 01:25:38.855
and his Joe Pesce buddy
from the casino.


1996
01:25:38.855 --> 01:25:40.355
I told you
they were crazy fans.


1997
01:25:40.355 --> 01:25:42.563
They're crazy.
They're not fans.


1998
01:25:43.563 --> 01:25:45.980
Why? What did you do?

1999
01:25:45.980 --> 01:25:47.855
I don't know.

2000
01:25:47.855 --> 01:25:50.313
I used to drink and black out,
it could be anything.


2001
01:25:51.438 --> 01:25:52.938
One day I woke up
after a five-day bender,


2002
01:25:52.938 --> 01:25:54.188
I was a manager of an Arby's.

2003
01:25:55.271 --> 01:25:57.771
Plus, I owe a lot of bad people
a lot of money.


2004
01:26:04.313 --> 01:26:05.896
You were right, man.

2005
01:26:06.896 --> 01:26:08.438
It's my fault.

2006
01:26:10.813 --> 01:26:12.480
It's... it's my fault.

2007
01:26:15.813 --> 01:26:17.896
Wow.

2008
01:26:17.896 --> 01:26:19.438
I had everything.

2009
01:26:20.230 --> 01:26:23.063
I had good friends.
I had a great job.


2010
01:26:24.521 --> 01:26:26.688
The most kind-hearted,

2011
01:26:26.688 --> 01:26:29.188
beautiful person
in the whole world loved me.


2012
01:26:31.563 --> 01:26:33.813
Erin's the best thing
that ever happened to me.


2013
01:26:35.480 --> 01:26:37.188
I'm going to lose it all.

2015
01:26:44.396 --> 01:26:47.021

Pretty melodies... ♪


2016
01:26:49.021 --> 01:26:51.188

2017
01:26:52.730 --> 01:26:54.480
I think it's a little late
for that, Wes.


2018
01:26:56.438 --> 01:26:57.896
No, it's not.

2019
01:26:58.813 --> 01:27:01.230
That was
Steve Smith in Washington.


2020
01:27:01.230 --> 01:27:02.896
And tomorrow night at 7 p.m.

2021
01:27:02.896 --> 01:27:05.896
we present
our Hero of the Week.


2022
01:27:10.230 --> 01:27:13.980
Seconds on steak fries?
Uh, yeah!


2023
01:27:16.230 --> 01:27:17.938
Visit your local Red Robin

2024
01:27:17.938 --> 01:27:20.855
to try our new
bottomless steak fries.


2025
01:27:21.688 --> 01:27:22.771
I swear to God, man,

2026
01:27:22.771 --> 01:27:24.605
Stanicky's like one of
those trick birthday candles -


2027
01:27:24.605 --> 01:27:26.605
no matter how hard
I try to blow him out,


2028
01:27:26.605 --> 01:27:27.813
he just keeps coming back.

2029
01:27:32.521 --> 01:27:34.188
Dean, I love you
like a brother,


2030
01:27:34.188 --> 01:27:36.188
but you got one major flaw.

2031
01:27:36.188 --> 01:27:37.646
Hmm?

2032
01:27:37.646 --> 01:27:39.021
You lie too much.

2033
01:27:40.688 --> 01:27:42.480
I lie too much?

2034
01:27:42.480 --> 01:27:44.188
What the...?

2035
01:27:44.188 --> 01:27:45.771
You lie just as much as me.

2036
01:27:45.771 --> 01:27:47.396
Only 'cause you make me.

2037
01:27:48.021 --> 01:27:49.896
I've been trying
to tell the truth on this one


2038
01:27:49.896 --> 01:27:51.021
from the beginning,

2039
01:27:51.021 --> 01:27:52.271
but you said no.

2040
01:27:52.271 --> 01:27:53.813
Because I was looking out
for JT.


2041
01:27:53.813 --> 01:27:55.063
I didn't want JT
to get in trouble.


2042
01:27:55.063 --> 01:27:58.021
Dude, this has
nothing to do with JT.


2043
01:27:59.105 --> 01:28:00.980
This has everything
to do with you.


2044
01:28:02.438 --> 01:28:05.480
Do you realize that Rod had a
fake life and he made it real?


2045
01:28:05.480 --> 01:28:07.438
You had a real life
and you made it fake.


2046
01:28:10.855 --> 01:28:13.230
Fuck this, man.
I don't need this shit.


2047
01:28:14.230 --> 01:28:15.938
You're not making
anything better.


2048
01:28:15.938 --> 01:28:17.771
Yo, I know you ain't
fall in no ditch.


2049
01:28:20.146 --> 01:28:21.355
What?

2050
01:28:21.355 --> 01:28:24.688
I know you didn't fall in
a ditch, that one Halloween.


2051
01:28:25.271 --> 01:28:26.855
When you broke your arm.

2052
01:28:27.355 --> 01:28:29.188
After we egged that house,

2053
01:28:29.188 --> 01:28:30.980
and we all split
in different directions,


2054
01:28:30.980 --> 01:28:33.438
I went back to your place
to see if you was there,


2055
01:28:33.438 --> 01:28:35.188
and you were.

2056
01:28:36.105 --> 01:28:37.188
And I heard him.

2057
01:28:39.980 --> 01:28:42.188
I heard what he did to you.

2058
01:28:43.855 --> 01:28:46.063
That was an accident.
He was drunk.


2059
01:28:46.063 --> 01:28:48.688
See, there you go again.
You're lying.


2060
01:28:49.396 --> 01:28:52.938
Dude, I understand you
grew up in a fucked-up house


2061
01:28:52.938 --> 01:28:55.105
and you had
a fucked-up father,


2062
01:28:55.105 --> 01:28:57.480
and that's why you slept over
at me and JT's house,


2063
01:28:57.480 --> 01:28:59.188
and that's probably why
you started a lie.


2064
01:28:59.188 --> 01:29:00.396
To protect yourself.

2065
01:29:00.396 --> 01:29:02.730
But you're not
that boy anymore,


2066
01:29:02.730 --> 01:29:04.230
and you're letting
this shitty stuff


2067
01:29:04.230 --> 01:29:05.980
turn you into a shitty person,
and that's not you.


2068
01:29:07.480 --> 01:29:09.438
If you just tell Erin
the truth,


2069
01:29:09.438 --> 01:29:11.355
she won't hurt you.

Hey. Where were you?

01:30:08.605 --> 01:30:10.521
I was worried about you.

2079
01:30:13.521 --> 01:30:15.313
I tried to call you.

2080
01:30:18.480 --> 01:30:20.688
Listen, Erin...

2081
01:30:22.438 --> 01:30:24.313
...you can't let them
run your story.


2082
01:30:24.313 --> 01:30:26.396
Yeah, well, it's a little
too late for that.


2083
01:30:26.396 --> 01:30:28.271
No, you don't understand.

2084
01:30:29.146 --> 01:30:32.021
Is there a way that you can
postpone it or pre-empt it?


2085
01:30:32.021 --> 01:30:34.063
Is that what they say
in your business? 'Pre-empt'?


2086
01:30:34.063 --> 01:30:35.563
'Cause there's a lot of things

2087
01:30:35.563 --> 01:30:37.021
that you need to know
about Ricky.


2088
01:30:37.021 --> 01:30:38.646
You mean Rock Hard Rod?

2089
01:30:40.480 --> 01:30:42.188
Don't look so surprised, Dean.

2090
01:30:42.980 --> 01:30:45.771
I'm a good reporter, you
said so yourself, remember?


2091
01:30:46.855 --> 01:30:48.105
Yeah, I know you are.

2092
01:30:48.105 --> 01:30:49.855
I figured it out at the bris.

2093
01:30:52.605 --> 01:30:54.771
Nairobi?

2094
01:30:54.771 --> 01:30:59.063
You said he had to fly back
to help fight Ebola,


2095
01:30:59.063 --> 01:31:01.896
but there hasn't been
an Ebola case


2096
01:31:01.896 --> 01:31:03.438
anywhere in the last four years

2097
01:31:03.438 --> 01:31:05.563
and definitely never
in Nairobi.


2098
01:31:05.563 --> 01:31:07.105
They actually have
a vaccine now.


2099
01:31:09.355 --> 01:31:10.396
That's good.

2100
01:31:10.896 --> 01:31:13.355
Ricky showed me your bible.

2101
01:31:14.271 --> 01:31:15.730
It's pathetic.

2102
01:31:16.396 --> 01:31:18.063
You guys lied so you could

2103
01:31:18.063 --> 01:31:20.146
go to
the Little League World Series,


2104
01:31:20.146 --> 01:31:22.688
the Lebowski Fest,
a tiny train museum.


2105
01:31:24.730 --> 01:31:26.188
Wes likes trains.

2106
01:31:26.188 --> 01:31:28.021
You went to Dollywood, twice!

2107
01:31:28.646 --> 01:31:31.313
Why didn't you take me
with you? I love Dolly Parton.


2108
01:31:31.855 --> 01:31:33.646
I'm sorry. I didn't know that.

2109
01:31:33.646 --> 01:31:36.313
What bothers me more
than the lies


2110
01:31:36.313 --> 01:31:39.313
is why you told them
in the first place.


2111
01:31:41.605 --> 01:31:43.771
You were running from me.

2112
01:31:44.896 --> 01:31:46.230
From us.

2113
01:31:46.230 --> 01:31:48.355
No. No, that's not true.

2114
01:31:48.355 --> 01:31:51.771
Well, it doesn't matter
anymore, Dean.


2115
01:31:52.980 --> 01:31:54.855
It's too late.

2116
01:32:13.313 --> 01:32:14.980
I just want
this day to be over.


2117
01:32:14.980 --> 01:32:16.688
Me too.

2118
01:32:16.688 --> 01:32:19.730
What if he chickened out? What
if he's going to bail on us?


2119
01:32:19.730 --> 01:32:21.146
Where is Dean?

2120
01:32:21.146 --> 01:32:23.896
He's, uh, on his...
He'll be here any minute.


2121
01:32:23.896 --> 01:32:25.438
And where is Ricky?

2122
01:32:25.438 --> 01:32:27.188
The World River execs
want to meet him.


2123
01:32:27.188 --> 01:32:31.021
Also on his way.
His attaché is here, so...


2124
01:32:31.938 --> 01:32:33.271
Hi.

2125
01:32:37.355 --> 01:32:38.980
So,
where were we?


2126
01:33:00.688 --> 01:33:02.063
Hey!

2127
01:33:02.688 --> 01:33:04.188
Where the hell
have you been?


2128
01:33:04.188 --> 01:33:05.438
The show starts
in three minutes.


2129
01:33:05.438 --> 01:33:07.063
Summerhayes wants Ricky
to introduce it.


2130
01:33:07.063 --> 01:33:08.646
- Where is this guy?
- There's no show.


2131
01:33:08.646 --> 01:33:10.105
What?

2132
01:33:10.105 --> 01:33:12.646
Ricky was never
going to be Hero of the Week.


2133
01:33:13.188 --> 01:33:14.938
Erin knew all along.

2134
01:33:14.938 --> 01:33:16.021
Knew what?

2135
01:33:16.021 --> 01:33:18.730
That Ricky was a fake.
She figured it out at the bris.


2136
01:33:18.730 --> 01:33:20.771
So she was lying to us?

2137
01:33:20.771 --> 01:33:22.688
Well, that's pretty
fuckin' low.


2138
01:33:23.271 --> 01:33:25.021
Are you an idiot?

2139
01:33:26.230 --> 01:33:28.063
What are we going to tell
Summerhayes?


2140
01:33:29.563 --> 01:33:30.688
The truth.

2141
01:33:30.688 --> 01:33:33.188
Dean, come on.
Don't do that. Dean!


2142
01:33:34.646 --> 01:33:36.271
Good evening, everyone.

2143
01:33:36.271 --> 01:33:38.771
Thank you all for coming out.
Thank you.


2144
01:33:38.771 --> 01:33:40.855
- Thank you.

2145
01:33:40.855 --> 01:33:44.730
I see a lot of old friends
out here tonight,


2146
01:33:44.730 --> 01:33:46.230
and a lot of new friends.

2147
01:33:46.230 --> 01:33:49.438
And I see two great companies

2148
01:33:49.438 --> 01:33:50.771
that can...

2149
01:33:50.771 --> 01:33:54.230
...can, uh,
do wonderful things.


2150
01:33:54.230 --> 01:33:56.980
I was hoping that the man
of the hour, Ricky Stanicky,


2151
01:33:56.980 --> 01:34:01.188
would be here to introduce
this MFMBC Heroes segment.


2152
01:34:01.188 --> 01:34:04.355
- Ted, can I say something?
- Yes, absolutely. Yes, please.


2153
01:34:04.355 --> 01:34:05.563
Dean Stanton,

2154
01:34:05.563 --> 01:34:07.480
our Vice President
of Investor Relations.


2155
01:34:07.480 --> 01:34:08.563
Dean.

2156
01:34:21.271 --> 01:34:22.813
Um...

2157
01:34:23.605 --> 01:34:26.646
Unfortunately,
MFMBC has decided


2158
01:34:26.646 --> 01:34:29.563
not to profile
Ricky Stanicky as a hero.


2159
01:34:29.563 --> 01:34:32.021
- Ha...

2160
01:34:32.021 --> 01:34:34.021
The reason being...

2161
01:34:35.230 --> 01:34:37.355
...that Ricky Stanicky's
not a hero.


2162
01:34:39.855 --> 01:34:42.021
He's not even a real person.

2163
01:34:45.188 --> 01:34:47.188
I made him up.

2164
01:34:47.188 --> 01:34:49.396
Motherfucker!

2165
01:34:54.521 --> 01:34:56.271
I lied to all of you.

2166
01:34:58.105 --> 01:35:00.271
And I have no excuses.

2167
01:35:03.646 --> 01:35:05.146
I'm sorry, Ted.

2168
01:35:06.021 --> 01:35:08.021
You don't deserve this.

2169
01:35:09.813 --> 01:35:11.438
I'd also like to
apologize to everyone


2170
01:35:11.438 --> 01:35:13.896
who came out here
from San Francisco.


2171
01:35:15.188 --> 01:35:18.063
Summerhayes Financial
is an excellent company.


2172
01:35:19.271 --> 01:35:20.938
Please don't let
my actions destroy


2173
01:35:20.938 --> 01:35:23.355
what could be
a great partnership.


2174
01:35:31.188 --> 01:35:32.938
What the fuck did he just say?

2175
01:35:33.438 --> 01:35:35.146
I don't know
what to do.


2176
01:35:35.146 --> 01:35:36.230
I told you...

2177
01:35:36.230 --> 01:35:38.146
Where is that
pumpkin-headed piece of shit?


2178
01:35:38.730 --> 01:35:40.521
I don't get it.

2179
01:35:40.521 --> 01:35:42.021
If the show wasn't for real,

2180
01:35:42.021 --> 01:35:43.646
then why'd the news crew
come in?


2181
01:35:45.313 --> 01:35:47.896
- What news crew?
- Yesterday.


2182
01:35:47.896 --> 01:35:49.271
While you were at lunch,

2183
01:35:49.271 --> 01:35:50.896
this crew came in
and interviewed Ricky.


2184
01:35:50.896 --> 01:35:52.605
I helped
set the whole thing up.


2185
01:36:00.938 --> 01:36:04.313
Dean, don't worry about
cleaning out your office.


2186
01:36:04.313 --> 01:36:06.563
We'll box it up for ya...

2187
01:36:06.563 --> 01:36:08.105
and then burn it.

2188
01:36:11.771 --> 01:36:13.646
I'm standing
outside the offices


2189
01:36:13.646 --> 01:36:15.230
of Summerhayes Financial,

2190
01:36:15.230 --> 01:36:16.480
an esteemed institution

2191
01:36:16.480 --> 01:36:19.105
in downtown Providence,
Rhode Island.


2192
01:36:19.105 --> 01:36:22.605
And that
is Richard Barbara Stanicky.


2193
01:36:22.605 --> 01:36:24.480
Think of us as the bookies
and you're the gambler.


2194
01:36:24.480 --> 01:36:27.230
We're the nice bookies, not the
throw-you-off-the bridge type.


2195
01:36:27.230 --> 01:36:29.313
After several
years helping the less...


2196
01:36:29.313 --> 01:36:31.105
Why the hell is this still on?!

2197
01:36:31.105 --> 01:36:33.188
...charity,
he's now the newest


2198
01:36:33.188 --> 01:36:35.855
and one of the most
highly paid executives


2199
01:36:35.855 --> 01:36:37.730
at Summerhayes Financial.

2200
01:36:38.646 --> 01:36:40.146
Where's the AV guy?

2201
01:36:40.146 --> 01:36:43.146
- Oh, that's me.
- I thought you were the IT guy.


2202
01:36:43.146 --> 01:36:44.563
I'm both.

2203
01:36:45.646 --> 01:36:47.521
But there's
something you should know


2204
01:36:47.521 --> 01:36:49.563
about this highly successful
executive.


2205
01:36:50.230 --> 01:36:51.896
He's a complete fraud.

2206
01:36:51.896 --> 01:36:53.980
I'm Ted Summerhayes...

2207
01:36:53.980 --> 01:36:55.146
That's right.

2208
01:36:55.146 --> 01:36:57.771
Ricky Stanicky
is actually Rodney Rimestead,


2209
01:36:57.771 --> 01:37:00.230
a pornographic
rock'n'roll impersonator


2210
01:37:00.230 --> 01:37:02.396
from Atlantic City, New Jersey,

2211
01:37:02.396 --> 01:37:06.230
who goes by the name
of Rock Hard Rod.


2212
01:37:06.230 --> 01:37:10.521
We caught up with Mr. Rimestead
to find out how he came to be


2213
01:37:10.521 --> 01:37:12.980
the businessman
'Ricky Stanicky'.


2214
01:37:12.980 --> 01:37:16.563
I was hanging around
a casino bar in Atlantic City.


2215
01:37:16.563 --> 01:37:19.855
No money, no friends,
no respect.


2216
01:37:19.855 --> 01:37:21.480
I was an alcoholic.

2217
01:37:22.063 --> 01:37:24.646
I am... I am an alcoholic.

2218
01:37:25.646 --> 01:37:27.896
And I was doing
whatever I could to get by.


2219

2223

And that night, I met
Dean Stanton and his friends.


2224
01:37:43.396 --> 01:37:45.646
They bought me food, drink.

2225
01:37:46.313 --> 01:37:48.813
They asked me who I was,
they really seemed to care.


2226
01:37:48.813 --> 01:37:51.021
And as Rod would discover,
they did care.


2227
01:37:58.855 --> 01:38:00.480
Dean!

2228
01:38:01.146 --> 01:38:02.938
You got to see this!

2229
01:38:02.938 --> 01:38:05.813
Within days,
Dean Stanton and his friends


2230
01:38:05.813 --> 01:38:07.355
would reach out again.

2231
01:38:07.355 --> 01:38:08.771
I couldn't believe they called.

2232
01:38:08.771 --> 01:38:10.105
These are people
I met only once


2233
01:38:10.105 --> 01:38:11.230
and only for a few minutes,

2234
01:38:11.230 --> 01:38:14.355
and here they were offering me
the opportunity of a lifetime.


2235
01:38:14.355 --> 01:38:16.813
And what was that opportunity?

2236
01:38:16.813 --> 01:38:20.105
Simply to become
'Ricky Stanicky'.


2237
01:38:20.105 --> 01:38:22.146
They said, "You are
no longer Rod Rimestead,


2238
01:38:22.146 --> 01:38:23.271
"the loser.

2239
01:38:23.271 --> 01:38:25.605
"From here on out, you're
Ricky Stanicky, the winner."


2240
01:38:26.438 --> 01:38:27.605
That was the first time

2241
01:38:27.605 --> 01:38:29.271
somebody had ever
believed in me.


2242
01:38:29.271 --> 01:38:32.146
After relocating
Rod, now Ricky, to Providence,


2243
01:38:32.146 --> 01:38:35.896
Dean Stanton and friends set
about creating a new identity


2244
01:38:35.896 --> 01:38:39.938
for the man who'd once MC'ed
an X-rated dog show.


2245
01:38:39.938 --> 01:38:41.355
We caution you -

2246
01:38:41.355 --> 01:38:44.688

disturbing to some viewers.


2247

2249
01:38:52.855 --> 01:38:54.646
Oh, my God!

2250
01:38:59.271 --> 01:39:03.105
They gave me a book.
They called it their bible.


2251
01:39:03.105 --> 01:39:06.355
It was like a blueprint for how
to live as Ricky Stanicky.


2252
01:39:06.355 --> 01:39:08.271
How to live a good life.

2253
01:39:08.271 --> 01:39:10.521
How to learn from your errors.

2254
01:39:10.521 --> 01:39:12.980
I saw what I could have been.

2255
01:39:12.980 --> 01:39:14.521
What I'd missed.

2256
01:39:15.146 --> 01:39:16.980
And the more and more
I read their bible,


2257
01:39:16.980 --> 01:39:18.021
the more I realized

2258
01:39:18.021 --> 01:39:19.605
this doesn't have to be
just a dream.


2259
01:39:19.605 --> 01:39:21.771
And so 'Ricky'
stopped drinking


2260
01:39:21.771 --> 01:39:24.021
and started respecting himself.

2261
01:39:24.021 --> 01:39:27.980
Soon he had a job here
at Summerhayes Financial.


2262
01:39:27.980 --> 01:39:29.938
Dean introduced me
to Ted Summerhayes.


2263
01:39:29.938 --> 01:39:31.021
He's one of those rich guys

2264
01:39:31.021 --> 01:39:32.813
who's gotta whip out
his big swinging super-yacht


2265
01:39:32.813 --> 01:39:34.980
- to show you how rich he is.
- Oh, God...


2266
01:39:34.980 --> 01:39:37.230
But, on the other hand,
the guy's got a heart of gold.


2267
01:39:37.230 --> 01:39:39.480
We started Feel
-Good Investing.

2268
01:39:39.480 --> 01:39:42.063
And then, through Dean,
I met more and more friends.


2269
01:39:43.105 --> 01:39:45.605
I met a beautiful girl,
with a beautiful soul.


2270
01:39:45.605 --> 01:39:47.063
Aw.

2271
01:39:47.063 --> 01:39:48.688
And I had a life.

2272
01:39:49.271 --> 01:39:51.021
I became 'Ricky Stanicky'.

2273
01:39:51.021 --> 01:39:53.021
And somewhere
in the middle of it all,


2274
01:39:53.021 --> 01:39:57.021
the line between the mythical
and the real had blurred.


2275
01:39:57.021 --> 01:40:01.355
And that's how, improbably,
a drunken Atlantic City reject


2276
01:40:01.355 --> 01:40:05.396
found himself blessed with
a new life in the Ocean State.


2277
01:40:05.396 --> 01:40:08.521
Hero? Me? No. No.

2278
01:40:08.521 --> 01:40:09.980
If there's a hero
to this story,


2279
01:40:09.980 --> 01:40:11.605
it's the men
who saved my life.


2280
01:40:11.605 --> 01:40:15.063
Dean Stanton, JT Levine
and Wes... something.


2281
01:40:15.813 --> 01:40:18.188
A story that
started out fraudulently,


2282
01:40:18.188 --> 01:40:20.271
somehow, miraculously,

2283
01:40:20.271 --> 01:40:24.605
became a tale of
redemption, rebirth and love.


2284
01:40:24.605 --> 01:40:27.938
Because he believed
that anybody at any time


2285
01:40:27.938 --> 01:40:30.688
can become
the person they want to be,


2286
01:40:30.688 --> 01:40:35.146
we choose Ricky Stanicky
as our Hero of the Week.


2287
01:40:41.021 --> 01:40:44.271

and feeling good
about your investments -


2299
01:41:14.438 --> 01:41:16.230
that's something
we're trying to achieve.


2300
01:41:16.896 --> 01:41:19.480
Well, that's... what we do.

2301
01:41:19.480 --> 01:41:22.063
Truth is, it was Ted
who saw the potential in Ricky.


2302
01:41:22.063 --> 01:41:24.105
It was also his idea
to start partnering


2303
01:41:24.105 --> 01:41:25.980
with more charitable
organizations.


2304
01:41:26.646 --> 01:41:29.188
- I just saw the tax incentives.

2305
01:41:29.188 --> 01:41:31.646
You're a humble
son of a bitch, aren't ya?


2306
01:41:31.646 --> 01:41:33.021
Ah...

2307
01:41:33.021 --> 01:41:34.105
So, do we have a deal?

2308
01:41:34.938 --> 01:41:36.355
I don't know.

2309
01:41:36.355 --> 01:41:38.563
Dean, what do you think?

2310
01:41:41.605 --> 01:41:42.938
We have a deal.

2311
01:41:42.938 --> 01:41:45.105
- Absolutely, we have a deal.
- Yeah, we have a deal.


2312
01:41:45.105 --> 01:41:46.563
- Great.
- Wonderful.


2313
01:41:47.771 --> 01:41:50.730
You let your made-up friend
circumcise our child?


2314
01:41:51.730 --> 01:41:54.063
Honey, he worked
at Beefsteak Charlie's.


2315
01:41:54.063 --> 01:41:55.521
Beefsteak...

2316
01:41:56.105 --> 01:41:57.605
That is it.

2317
01:41:57.605 --> 01:41:59.271
You are camping out
in the backyard


2318
01:41:59.271 --> 01:42:00.396
for the next six months.

2319
01:42:00.396 --> 01:42:01.771
Okay. Okay.

2320
01:42:01.771 --> 01:42:04.313
Very reasonable.
That's more than fair.


2321
01:42:04.313 --> 01:42:06.313
It's going to be great.
Thank you.


2322
01:42:06.313 --> 01:42:08.063
-  Perfect.
-  Thank you.


2323
01:42:14.938 --> 01:42:16.480
I don't understand.

2324
01:42:16.980 --> 01:42:19.021
How did this happen?

2325
01:42:19.021 --> 01:42:20.521
Well...

2326
01:42:20.521 --> 01:42:23.063
When I found out
what you did, I was pissed.


2327
01:42:24.480 --> 01:42:27.855
I told you I sold the story to
MFMBC just to fuck with you.


2328
01:42:28.855 --> 01:42:32.105
But when Ricky was hired
at Summerhayes, I thought,


2329
01:42:32.105 --> 01:42:35.980
wait a minute, maybe there
actually is a story here.


2330
01:42:35.980 --> 01:42:38.271
So I pitched it
to my producer at Channel 6.


2331
01:42:38.271 --> 01:42:40.021
They told their friend
at MFMBC


2332
01:42:40.021 --> 01:42:42.021
and they gave me
the green light.


2333
01:42:44.105 --> 01:42:46.230
All those lies, Erin...

2334
01:42:50.396 --> 01:42:52.355
Can you ever forgive me?

2335
01:42:57.146 --> 01:42:59.313
It's definitely not
going to be easy.


2336
01:43:01.021 --> 01:43:02.230
But...

2337
01:43:03.438 --> 01:43:04.813
...this helps.

2338
01:43:05.480 --> 01:43:07.605
I had everything.

2339
01:43:07.605 --> 01:43:09.646
I had good friends.
I had a great job.


2340
01:43:11.938 --> 01:43:13.730
The most kind-hearted,

2341
01:43:13.730 --> 01:43:16.563
beautiful person
in the whole world loved me.


2342
01:43:18.646 --> 01:43:21.146
Erin's the best thing
that ever happened to me.


2343
01:43:24.355 --> 01:43:26.646
Ricky sent it to me today.

2344
01:43:30.313 --> 01:43:32.855
Here we go, here we go,
here we go...


2345
01:43:32.855 --> 01:43:34.021
Who's that?

2346
01:43:36.271 --> 01:43:38.396
Ricky! Look out!

2347
01:43:45.688 --> 01:43:48.063
Did that go how you
thought it would, wanker?!


2348
01:43:49.146 --> 01:43:52.771
Here, Rimestead!
You've officially been served.


2349
01:43:53.563 --> 01:43:54.938
What the...?

2350
01:43:55.896 --> 01:43:57.063
What's this?

2351
01:43:57.063 --> 01:44:00.021
This is a cease-and-desist
order from Billy Idol.


2352
01:44:00.021 --> 01:44:01.021
Yeah?

2353
01:44:01.021 --> 01:44:02.730
If you disgrace
any of his songs


2354
01:44:02.730 --> 01:44:05.438
with your disgusting lyrics
ever again,


2355
01:44:05.438 --> 01:44:06.771
we'll see you in court.

2356
01:44:06.771 --> 01:44:07.980
Huh?

2357
01:44:09.480 --> 01:44:10.646
Yeah.

2358
01:44:14.438 --> 01:44:15.980
So Billy Idol saw my act?

2359
01:44:15.980 --> 01:44:17.563
Fuck off!

2360
01:44:18.855 --> 01:44:20.230
Sweet!

2361
01:44:20.771 --> 01:44:23.105
More champagne, everyone!

2362
01:44:26.355 --> 01:44:27.730

Oh!

01:45:11.730 --> 01:45:14.146
Time to go bump and grind

- Yeah, I signed us up.

01:45:25.605 --> 01:45:27.480
We're going to help
clean up Narragansett Bay.

Yeah, man.
