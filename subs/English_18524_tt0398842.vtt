1
00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.490
Mr. Woodson! Take a shot.

2
00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.250
Oh, nice shot.

3
00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.930
- Get up.
- Hey, over here!


4
00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.890
- Mr. Woodson!
- Nice pass.


5
00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:22.970
Hey, John.

6
00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.730
Listen, the board met
this afternoon...


7
00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.530
...and it's as bad as we thought.

8
00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.730
They're cutting back
the whole department.


9
00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.570
What, are you laying me off?

10
00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.330
We knew this was coming. At this
point, it's just a leave of absence.


11
00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.490
With any luck, you'll be back
with us next fall.


12
00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.170
You're laying me off.

13
00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.970
- I'm sorry, John.
- That's okay.


14
00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.210
Hey, hey. Michael Jordan was only

15
00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.130
Of course, he was in kindergarten
and he could dunk the ball.


16
00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.690
Just keep practicing. All right?

17
00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:24.290
<i>- Hello?
- John? It's Charlene.</i>


18
00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:28.930
Charlene? Wow, I was just
thinking about you the other day.


19
00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.090
Listen, I'm so glad I was able
to reach you. I'm in town.


20
00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.650
I was hoping you might have
some time to get together.


21
00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:37.810
Oh, yeah, I got a lot of time.

22
00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:41.010
Well, I'm staying at the Hilton,
near the airport.


23
00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:43.010
So, what did you wanna
talk to me about?


24
00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:49.250
Last month I was in Peru
doing a piece on a relief project.


25
00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:53.690
We went to this place called Viciente
and I met a priest there.


26
00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:57.730
His name is Father Jose,
he's also an archaeologist.


27
00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.610
He told me about some scrolls that
he had discovered a few years ago.


28
00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:04.770
What kind of scrolls?

29
00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:08.690
Ancient writings.
No one knows who wrote them.


30
00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:11.170
It's a prophecy.

31
00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:14.250
Really? What does it predict?

32
00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:17.490
According to Father Jose,
it says that...


33
00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:23.850
...all the conflict, the chaos
in this world, it's changing us.


34
00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:25.970
And what does that mean?

35
00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:29.810
It means that the violence
is waking us up, in a way.


36
00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:35.010
The prophecy says that
we're going to discover something.


37
00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:37.170
Which is?

38
00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:38.930
He was vague about it...

39
00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:42.210
...but he said that it'll make us
look at everything differently.


40
00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:49.410
I know this all sounds weird...

41
00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:53.970
...but if you'll just listen...

42
00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:57.330
Okay. Okay. I'll listen.

43
00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:00.290
So when is this revelation
supposed to happen?


44
00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:03.530
The prophecy says it'll begin during
the first years of this century.


45
00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:05.530
Well, that's now.

46
00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:08.290
Yeah, I know.

47
00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:14.650
Excuse me, sir. Can I
please get my luggage?


48
00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:16.730
Certainly. Will you be needing
a taxi today?


49
00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:19.970
- Yes, please.
- The baggage will be out by the cab.


50
00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:21.770
Great. It's just one bag.

51
00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:31.490
Have you ever wondered why
we don't spend more time together?


52
00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:34.050
How long have I known you,
five or six years?


53
00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:35.730
About that long, yeah.

54
00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:38.010
How many relationships
have you had?


55
00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:43.490
You get involved with somebody
because it makes you feel good...


56
00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:47.090
...but it never works out
because you're not really there.


57
00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:50.010
Whatever happened to that
big theory you were trying to find?


58
00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:52.450
Inspire all those kids.
What happened to that?


59
00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:55.170
I found out it isn't that easy.

60
00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:59.490
You should go to Viciente, John.

61
00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:03.530
They're studying this prophecy
down there. I can't explain it...


62
00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:07.290
...but the people there are different.
This place is different.


63
00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:09.770
Why are you calling me
about all this now?


64
00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:14.210
Because every time I would think of
this prophecy, I would think of you.


65
00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:16.370
Then I found out that
I had a stopover here.


66
00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:20.090
Maybe you're hearing this
at the right time.


67
00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:38.530
Hey, Meredith.

68
00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:43.530
Whatcha say, darling?
How are you?


69
00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:52.570
Have a good day, girl?
Better than mine, I hope.


70
00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:54.170
<i>You should go to Viciente, John.
The people there are different.</i>


71
00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:57.210
<i>This place is different.</i>

72
00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:00.890
Travel agency...

73
00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:20.930
Cancellation? When's it leaving?
Tomorrow?


74
00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:24.290
Yeah, I'll take it. 
All right, thanks.

75
00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:29.610
Wanna go to Peru?

76
00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:36.570
<i>I haven't been in Lima in quite a while.
How long have you lived there?</i>


77
00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:39.130
Oh, I'm new to Peru.
I've lived in Bolivia...


78
00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:41.970
...for the last 10 years, so I haven't
met your Father Jose.


79
00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:45.250
In any case, the local priests are
so numerous, aren't they?


80
00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:47.650
I suppose they are.

81
00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:51.330
Excuse me. I just heard you
mention a Father Jose?


82
00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:55.010
A friend of mine
just told me about him.


83
00:09:55.690 --> 00:09:58.050
Dobson. Dr. Sidney Dobson.

84
00:09:58.490 --> 00:10:01.610
Would you like a drink?
Two more Scotches, please.


85
00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:03.650
Sure, right away.

86
00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:08.690
- So are you a scientist?
- Oh, no. John Woodson, tourist.


87
00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:12.130
But I'm going to Peru because I'm
interested in this place called Viciente.


88
00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:13.730
Yes.

89
00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:20.730
I met Jose in Boston
at an anthropological meeting.


90
00:10:20.890 --> 00:10:23.130
I kept in touch over the years.

91
00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:27.490
I had no idea what he had found until
several weeks ago. He called me...


92
00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:30.970
...and asked me to help affirm
the prophecy's authenticity.


93
00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:35.930
He sent me copies of the first two
scrolls along with translations.


94
00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:39.290
Real thing.
There's no doubt about it.


95
00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:43.610
Written no later than 5 or 6 B.C.
But you know the curious thing?


96
00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:45.410
They were found in a wooden box...

97
00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:49.370
<i>... which dates to
only about 1600 A.D.</i>


98
00:10:49.570 --> 00:10:52.050
<i>Someone in the early Church
had buried them.</i>


99
00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:55.450
Early Church? Franciscan or Jesuit?

100
00:10:56.970 --> 00:10:59.170
Oh, I'm a history teacher.

101
00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:03.170
Well, apparently Franciscan. Although
they seem to be inspired by a pope.


102
00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:06.930
Celestine V, I think.

103
00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:11.370
You mentioned that you had copies of
them. Can you tell me what they say?


104
00:11:11.530 --> 00:11:12.970
No, not really.

105
00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:16.730
They talk about a shift in human
understanding, I don't know.


106
00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:19.650
But, you know, the curious thing,
the most astonishing thing...


107
00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:22.330
...is the description
of the modern era.


108
00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:27.290
Our problems, our technologies.
I mean, it is utterly amazing.


109
00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:28.570
Think about it.

110
00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:33.090
A document this old, speaking
in such detail about our time?


111
00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:35.610
Think about it.

112
00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:49.730
It was a pleasure
traveling with you.


113
00:11:49.890 --> 00:11:53.210
- You staying in town?
- Delgado.


114
00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:55.250
I'm just down the street
at the Hacienda.


115
00:11:55.410 --> 00:11:58.530
Father Jose's church is just down
the street from there.


116
00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:01.370
Why don't you come see him
with me in the morning?


117
00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:02.850
He has the original scrolls.

118
00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:06.330
He wants to make them public
as soon as possible.


119
00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:08.890
- Why's that?
- I don't know.


120
00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:11.810
You can ask him yourself
in the morning.


121
00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:23.850
You see someone
down there you know?


122
00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:27.810
Oh, no. No, not really.

123
00:12:29.930 --> 00:12:31.610
Pretty girl.

124
00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:10.850
Saint Francis was a great man.

125
00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:13.450
He could see beauty
where others couldn't.


126
00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:17.050
- I'm sorry, I was just taking a walk.
- It's all right.


127
00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:21.130
American? Now, what has
brought you to Peru?


128
00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:24.730
You're Father Jose, aren't you?

129
00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:27.330
I'm John Woodson.

130
00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:30.410
A friend of mine, Charlene Benet,
met you a few weeks ago.


131
00:14:30.570 --> 00:14:32.850
And she told you
about our prophecy.


132
00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:38.530
John, listen to me. I know you.

133
00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:40.770
You're here to do
something important.


134
00:14:40.930 --> 00:14:42.490
<i>But you need to leave quickly.</i>

135
00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:44.890
- What are you talking about?
- Go!


136
00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:48.170
I will try to help you.

137
00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:03.970
You have caused us
a lot of trouble, old man.


138
00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:09.650
It was in a hidden compartment
in the wall of the sacristy.


139
00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:13.850
You should have
hidden them better, Padre.


140
00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:18.050
Eight scrolls.

141
00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:24.290
Where's the ninth?

142
00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:29.410
Okay.

143
00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:33.570
One way or another,
I'm going to put an end to all of this.


144
00:15:33.730 --> 00:15:36.850
You're going to try.
You will do everything you can.


145
00:15:37.010 --> 00:15:39.330
But it's already too late.

146
00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:48.450
You are very calm
for a man about to die.


147
00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:52.650
Everybody dies. 
Even you, senor.

148
00:16:02.410 --> 00:16:05.690
John! Wait. Slow down a minute.

149
00:16:05.850 --> 00:16:07.530
Why didn't you just call the police?

150
00:16:07.690 --> 00:16:09.850
I'm not sure what's going on.
It could be nothing.


151
00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:13.970
Nothing? You got me out of bed in the
middle of the night for nothing?


152
00:16:27.490 --> 00:16:30.210
Don't do that.
You'll never get rid of her.


153
00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:36.330
What the...? John!

154
00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:42.930
Need some help?

155
00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:55.690
They seem to have left.

156
00:17:58.370 --> 00:18:01.850
We were going to that church a block
away, looking for the priest.


157
00:18:03.130 --> 00:18:04.850
Father Jose?

158
00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:08.730
- Yeah.
- And who is "we"?


159
00:18:09.410 --> 00:18:13.690
This professor, I met him on a plane.
He's looking for some artifact.


160
00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:15.650
The prophecy.

161
00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:20.010
Go on.

162
00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:21.770
Wait a minute.

163
00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:23.970
You know about all this?

164
00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:26.170
Who are you?

165
00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:30.170
Part of your story, apparently.
My name is Wil.


166
00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:33.250
- John.
- I'm a guide.


167
00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:39.010
I was working with Jose
when he found the scrolls.


168
00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:42.050
That's him, yeah.

169
00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:46.850
- Who's this woman?
- Julia Sims. She's a friend, a linguist.


170
00:18:47.010 --> 00:18:49.490
- Translated most of the prophecy.
- And him?


171
00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:51.050
His name is Father Sanchez.

172
00:18:51.210 --> 00:18:53.970
He lives in the mountains
with the local Indians.


173
00:18:54.130 --> 00:18:55.810
Philosopher, you could say.

174
00:18:56.770 --> 00:18:58.930
I have a feeling you'll meet him.

175
00:19:01.050 --> 00:19:06.050
Now, what about your friend, the
professor? Tell me what happened.


176
00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:09.850
They took him, right in front of me.
That's why I was running.


177
00:19:10.930 --> 00:19:12.890
I think they got Father Jose too.

178
00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:18.610
Put this on.

179
00:19:20.290 --> 00:19:22.050
We have to leave.

180
00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:28.730
You think it'd be safe
to go back to the hotel?


181
00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:36.170
- I don't think so.
- Maybe you could take me...


182
00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:37.970
...to the American Embassy.

183
00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:44.370
Too risky.

184
00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:56.210
General.
His Excellency Cardinal Sebastian.


185
00:19:59.450 --> 00:20:01.530
Such a surprise
to have you visit me.


186
00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:06.210
You've arrested an American.

187
00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:07.810
A professor.

188
00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:11.650
On his way to meet with
your Father Jose.


189
00:20:12.850 --> 00:20:13.810
Cigar?

190
00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:18.690
Don't you realize this will only bring
more publicity?


191
00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:21.210
You should have consulted me.

192
00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:26.090
Permit me to remind you,
Your Excellency.


193
00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:29.770
It was you who informed me
of the dangers of the prophecy.


194
00:20:30.130 --> 00:20:33.410
And it was you who sought my help.

195
00:20:34.050 --> 00:20:36.370
I said the document was heretical.

196
00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:38.890
That it needed to be contained.

197
00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:41.410
I didn't say create an incident
with the Americans.


198
00:20:42.050 --> 00:20:43.490
There will be an investigation.

199
00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:46.210
This country is a democracy now.

200
00:20:48.290 --> 00:20:50.370
This prophecy
is creating instability...


201
00:20:50.530 --> 00:20:52.890
...at a time
when we're already threatened...


202
00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:57.650
...by insurrection. Besides, you must
understand that there are other...


203
00:20:58.010 --> 00:21:04.450
...interests involved in this matter now.
This prophecy must be dealt with.


204
00:21:05.410 --> 00:21:07.850
Other interests.

205
00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:11.290
Father Jose, he was not present
at Mass this morning.


206
00:21:12.210 --> 00:21:13.170
No one can find him.

207
00:21:14.850 --> 00:21:18.450
People go missing every day
in Peru.


208
00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:23.490
If you want,
I'll have someone look into it.


209
00:21:24.410 --> 00:21:26.810
The scrolls are Church property.

210
00:21:27.970 --> 00:21:30.130
They must be returned to me.

211
00:21:45.410 --> 00:21:51.130
It's all I can bear,
to tolerate his arrogance.


212
00:21:51.330 --> 00:21:54.810
In a moment, he can remove
anyone from the Church.


213
00:21:54.970 --> 00:21:57.090
Damn them forever.

214
00:21:57.970 --> 00:22:01.690
We might control
the people's minds...


215
00:22:01.850 --> 00:22:04.410
...but he controls their souls.

216
00:22:04.570 --> 00:22:08.130
He can be used.
That's all that interests me.


217
00:22:08.290 --> 00:22:10.170
This is all a waste of my time.

218
00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:13.410
This prophecy, it's nothing.

219
00:22:13.570 --> 00:22:16.130
Why do you fear it so?

220
00:22:19.690 --> 00:22:22.810
Because, general,
in the world it predicts...


221
00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:26.010
...there's no need for people
like you and me.


222
00:22:33.010 --> 00:22:35.810
Do your part and
you'll get what you want.


223
00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:41.530
Do you have the pictures
of the other American?


224
00:22:45.850 --> 00:22:48.450
General, what about
Professor Dobson?


225
00:22:48.730 --> 00:22:52.930
Call the American Embassy.
Tell them his detention was a mistake.


226
00:22:53.410 --> 00:22:57.810
Then take him to the airport.
I think he'll be ready to go home.


227
00:23:03.090 --> 00:23:06.090
Now, who are you?

228
00:23:06.250 --> 00:23:09.650
And what are you doing
in my country?


229
00:23:15.570 --> 00:23:18.850
I called the embassy.
Dobson's okay.


230
00:23:19.850 --> 00:23:23.410
They're saying it was a case of
mistaken identity.


231
00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:25.370
He's already headed back to
the States.


232
00:23:25.530 --> 00:23:27.250
What about Father Jose?

233
00:23:27.970 --> 00:23:30.010
No one has seen him.

234
00:23:30.170 --> 00:23:33.730
I think someone is trying to
suppress the prophecy.


235
00:23:33.890 --> 00:23:36.410
Who'd do that, Wil? Why?

236
00:23:36.570 --> 00:23:38.370
Certain people in the government,
probably.


237
00:23:39.370 --> 00:23:40.890
They view it as a threat.

238
00:23:41.050 --> 00:23:44.770
It's not, of course,
but they don't see that.


239
00:23:44.930 --> 00:23:46.610
Maybe I should try to get home too.

240
00:23:46.770 --> 00:23:49.130
If they let Dobson go,
maybe it's safe for me to leave.


241
00:23:50.410 --> 00:23:53.250
Or maybe you should come with me.

242
00:23:55.330 --> 00:23:58.930
Do you suppose it was an accident
that you came to Peru...


243
00:23:59.090 --> 00:24:00.850
...that you met Dobson?

244
00:24:02.010 --> 00:24:05.490
How did you end up taking
that particular flight?


245
00:24:05.650 --> 00:24:07.330
Think about it.

246
00:24:07.890 --> 00:24:10.570
Why did I see you from my window
when I did?


247
00:24:11.010 --> 00:24:12.010
You're gonna love this.

248
00:24:12.170 --> 00:24:14.890
I was all set to get out of there,
I was packed, I was ready...


249
00:24:15.050 --> 00:24:18.610
...and then I had this strange feeling
I'd forgotten something.


250
00:24:20.010 --> 00:24:21.650
That's when you showed up.

251
00:24:26.730 --> 00:24:28.970
Are you telling me
this is some kind of a fate thing?


252
00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:31.810
That I'm supposed to go with you?
For what?


253
00:24:33.290 --> 00:24:36.770
There's part of the prophecy
that still has to be found.


254
00:24:39.570 --> 00:24:42.850
One more scroll. The ninth.

255
00:24:45.330 --> 00:24:46.770
No, no, no. Forget about it.

256
00:24:46.930 --> 00:24:48.770
I don't even know if
I believe this stuff.


257
00:24:48.930 --> 00:24:53.090
All I had in mind was to come to Peru
and find Viciente. That's it.


258
00:24:54.210 --> 00:24:55.890
Where you headed to, anyway?

259
00:24:56.330 --> 00:24:57.770
Viciente.

260
00:25:23.370 --> 00:25:25.850
Viciente, what's it like?

261
00:25:26.010 --> 00:25:29.370
It's an old ranch, about 1000 acres.

262
00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:31.610
Been in the owner's family
for hundreds of years.


263
00:25:31.770 --> 00:25:34.730
It goes all the way back to
the Spanish land grants.


264
00:25:34.890 --> 00:25:36.490
The Moors.

265
00:25:37.450 --> 00:25:39.930
These days, it's a kind of retreat.

266
00:25:41.730 --> 00:25:43.930
And the people there,
they're studying the prophecy?


267
00:25:44.090 --> 00:25:45.610
Some of them.

268
00:25:45.770 --> 00:25:47.050
Tell me about it.

269
00:25:48.050 --> 00:25:51.010
So far,
we've discovered eight scrolls.


270
00:25:52.050 --> 00:25:54.650
Each one contains a certain truth
about our existence.


271
00:25:54.810 --> 00:25:56.730
We call them insights.

272
00:25:56.930 --> 00:26:01.290
Insights, the prophecy says,
we've all gotta understand.


273
00:26:02.850 --> 00:26:06.810
Look, I could describe these insights
to you right now...


274
00:26:07.010 --> 00:26:09.090
...and you would hear my words...

275
00:26:10.290 --> 00:26:12.410
...but you have to do more than that.

276
00:26:14.170 --> 00:26:16.490
You have to experience it
for yourself.


277
00:26:16.650 --> 00:26:19.410
The prophecy has to happen to you.

278
00:26:23.810 --> 00:26:26.090
I have no idea
what you're talking about.


279
00:26:28.290 --> 00:26:31.330
I'm talking about
seeing the world, John.


280
00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:33.530
The way it really is.

281
00:26:52.170 --> 00:26:55.450
You get the first insight
when you realize...


282
00:26:55.610 --> 00:26:58.010
...there's a mystery
operating out there...


283
00:26:58.170 --> 00:27:01.010
...moving us somewhere,
for a reason.


284
00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:05.290
It's there for everyone,
but only a few notice.


285
00:27:06.850 --> 00:27:09.090
You're talking about
these weird coincidences?


286
00:27:09.250 --> 00:27:13.290
Once you begin to really look,
you start seeing them more and more.


287
00:27:13.930 --> 00:27:16.930
Well, if it's true they have meaning,
that would be incredible.


288
00:27:17.090 --> 00:27:20.290
I mean, I know history.
That would change everything.


289
00:27:20.450 --> 00:27:24.690
That's the second insight,
that the world is about to change.


290
00:27:25.890 --> 00:27:28.010
What about the others?

291
00:27:30.090 --> 00:27:34.650
In time,
you'll open up your perception...


292
00:27:34.810 --> 00:27:36.330
...find your guidance.

293
00:27:36.490 --> 00:27:39.730
You'll discover
why you're really here.


294
00:27:41.930 --> 00:27:43.770
What about
the missing ninth scroll?


295
00:27:43.930 --> 00:27:46.250
I believe it puts the others
into perspective.


296
00:27:47.170 --> 00:27:49.210
Shows us where it's all leading.

297
00:27:52.530 --> 00:27:55.650
And what makes you think
you can ever find it?


298
00:27:58.770 --> 00:28:01.210
Because that's why I'm here.

299
00:28:25.410 --> 00:28:27.770
Dream anything last night?

300
00:28:30.370 --> 00:28:33.570
Yeah. Little girl
I dreamed about before.


301
00:28:33.730 --> 00:28:35.450
It makes no sense.

302
00:28:35.610 --> 00:28:36.930
It's probably important.

303
00:28:38.530 --> 00:28:39.810
Why would you say that?

304
00:28:39.970 --> 00:28:42.330
Because regardless of
how confusing they are...


305
00:28:42.490 --> 00:28:44.810
...dreams are always trying to
tell us something.


306
00:28:46.210 --> 00:28:48.250
Maybe you just need
a larger perspective.


307
00:28:57.890 --> 00:29:00.050
My God.

308
00:29:00.930 --> 00:29:03.050
What is this place?

309
00:29:03.210 --> 00:29:05.170
Celestine ruins.

310
00:29:05.970 --> 00:29:08.290
They found the
first eight scrolls there.


311
00:29:08.450 --> 00:29:11.130
- Maybe the ninth is there too.
- Maybe.


312
00:29:11.290 --> 00:29:13.210
What's that over there?

313
00:29:13.410 --> 00:29:17.730
The mission. Cardinal Sebastian
had it rebuilt 10 years ago.


314
00:29:17.890 --> 00:29:19.490
He's the head of the Church here.

315
00:29:19.650 --> 00:29:21.890
Viciente, where's that?

316
00:29:23.010 --> 00:29:24.850
In a hurry?

317
00:29:43.650 --> 00:29:45.210
Rebels.

318
00:29:45.370 --> 00:29:47.170
It's been going on for a while here.

319
00:29:47.570 --> 00:29:49.530
They're trying to
overthrow the government?


320
00:29:49.730 --> 00:29:52.810
These things are always about
power struggle.


321
00:29:53.290 --> 00:29:56.450
- They're really well supplied.
- Yeah.


322
00:29:59.410 --> 00:30:01.210
Let's move.

323
00:30:31.290 --> 00:30:32.730
Miguel.

324
00:30:33.610 --> 00:30:37.410
Wil. I had a feeling you'd show up.

325
00:30:40.970 --> 00:30:42.930
Good to see you.

326
00:30:45.570 --> 00:30:47.690
It's good to see you, my friend.

327
00:30:47.850 --> 00:30:50.930
Julia's already arrived
and Father Sanchez is on his way.


328
00:30:51.090 --> 00:30:52.570
I knew it.

329
00:30:53.250 --> 00:30:55.130
You think it's time, don't you?

330
00:30:55.730 --> 00:30:57.850
Yeah. I do.

331
00:30:58.010 --> 00:30:59.570
John.

332
00:31:01.890 --> 00:31:04.490
Meet my friend, Miguel.
We are his guests here.


333
00:31:05.650 --> 00:31:09.410
Hi. It's a beautiful place.
Heck of a time getting here.


334
00:31:09.570 --> 00:31:13.490
Yeah. We like to consider it
our little oasis.


335
00:31:14.850 --> 00:31:17.490
Well, look what the wind blew in.

336
00:31:17.650 --> 00:31:20.450
Julia. Julia.

337
00:31:20.610 --> 00:31:23.330
I saw your truck come in.

338
00:31:24.290 --> 00:31:26.130
I'm so glad you're here.

339
00:31:26.290 --> 00:31:28.450
Did you drive straight through?

340
00:31:28.610 --> 00:31:30.010
- Meet John.
- Hi.


341
00:31:30.170 --> 00:31:31.450
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.


342
00:31:31.930 --> 00:31:35.530
We've been working on the
translations and we found something.


343
00:31:36.770 --> 00:31:40.210
It seems to be saying that
the ninth isn't on a scroll at all.


344
00:31:40.370 --> 00:31:42.930
It's going to just appear.

345
00:31:44.010 --> 00:31:45.570
Appear?

346
00:31:45.730 --> 00:31:47.570
Could be there's something
we have to do.


347
00:31:47.730 --> 00:31:50.050
Something to make it happen.

348
00:31:51.490 --> 00:31:53.050
That was some ride.

349
00:31:53.930 --> 00:31:55.250
He's involved somehow.

350
00:31:55.410 --> 00:31:57.570
Maybe you should talk to him.

351
00:32:27.170 --> 00:32:28.330
It's beautiful, isn't it?

352
00:32:33.130 --> 00:32:34.370
Come walk with me.

353
00:32:59.010 --> 00:33:01.570
What's going on here?
What are they doing?


354
00:33:01.730 --> 00:33:05.770
Let's just say they're
giving the garden their attention.


355
00:33:10.170 --> 00:33:13.130
How much do you know about
the prophecy?


356
00:33:13.290 --> 00:33:15.290
Not that much, not yet.

357
00:33:17.890 --> 00:33:20.090
Have you been having dreams?

358
00:33:20.490 --> 00:33:24.130
Something brought you here, right?
Synchronicity?


359
00:33:24.290 --> 00:33:26.210
Yeah, how'd you know that?

360
00:33:26.850 --> 00:33:29.250
Because that's how it begins
for everyone.


361
00:33:29.410 --> 00:33:32.130
Wil told me I had to open up,
whatever that means.


362
00:33:33.290 --> 00:33:35.530
And you think that's strange?

363
00:33:35.690 --> 00:33:39.610
Well, I have no idea what
he's talking about with that. Seriously.


364
00:33:40.010 --> 00:33:42.690
There's much more to the world
than you think, John.


365
00:33:43.770 --> 00:33:45.250
A beauty...

366
00:33:46.050 --> 00:33:47.930
...and energy.

367
00:33:55.330 --> 00:33:58.250
You talk about strange,
I know that woman.


368
00:33:58.690 --> 00:34:00.010
I saw her at the airport.

369
00:34:00.170 --> 00:34:03.370
Go talk to her,
if you'd like. I'll wait.

370
00:34:06.570 --> 00:34:09.050
Hi. I hope I'm not disturbing you.

371
00:34:09.250 --> 00:34:12.130
I'm John Woodson.
Julia's showing me around.


372
00:34:13.530 --> 00:34:14.490
Marjorie Carter.

373
00:34:22.450 --> 00:34:26.050
Some place here, huh? I hear it goes
all the way back to colonial times.


374
00:34:26.210 --> 00:34:31.170
Yeah. Yeah, no, it's one of the most
incredible spots I have ever seen.


375
00:34:38.850 --> 00:34:40.650
I suppose you're staying here
at the house?


376
00:34:40.850 --> 00:34:42.210
We should get together later.

377
00:34:42.370 --> 00:34:44.250
Talk some more about all this stuff.

378
00:34:45.210 --> 00:34:47.010
Not this time.

379
00:34:50.010 --> 00:34:52.650
Come on, you should do this.
It'll be fun.


380
00:34:54.850 --> 00:34:57.930
You can tell me all about
what's happening here.


381
00:34:58.090 --> 00:34:59.850
I'm interested in everything.

382
00:35:00.450 --> 00:35:04.330
I've got a lot of work to get through.
I'm gonna get to it.


383
00:35:04.890 --> 00:35:06.410
Nice to meet you.

384
00:35:08.490 --> 00:35:10.250
What was that?

385
00:35:11.290 --> 00:35:12.610
Didn't work out too well, huh?

386
00:35:12.770 --> 00:35:15.170
That's the understatement
of the year.


387
00:35:15.330 --> 00:35:16.890
What did I say?

388
00:35:17.090 --> 00:35:19.450
It's not what you said,
it's what you did.


389
00:35:20.010 --> 00:35:22.810
Your energy made her feel as though
you wanted to control her.


390
00:35:22.970 --> 00:35:24.410
She felt dominated.

391
00:35:24.570 --> 00:35:27.810
Oh, come on. I wasn't doing that.

392
00:35:27.970 --> 00:35:30.850
Really? You weren't trying to
coax her into something?


393
00:35:31.010 --> 00:35:32.530
- No.
- Manipulate her?


394
00:35:32.690 --> 00:35:34.650
She isn't used to that around here.

395
00:35:34.810 --> 00:35:37.210
That's completely nuts.
Where are you getting this stuff?


396
00:35:37.410 --> 00:35:39.050
I could see it.

397
00:35:40.570 --> 00:35:43.090
Remember the halos
the old masters used to paint...


398
00:35:43.250 --> 00:35:45.530
...around their religious figures?

399
00:35:45.890 --> 00:35:49.370
You think they made those up,
or were they seeing something real?


400
00:35:50.330 --> 00:35:53.250
It's the energy, John.
It reveals what we do to each other.


401
00:35:53.410 --> 00:35:56.970
You may not be conscious of it,
but you were taking her energy.


402
00:35:58.210 --> 00:35:59.970
I could see it.

403
00:36:01.010 --> 00:36:02.210
So could she.

404
00:36:12.130 --> 00:36:14.370
How did the afternoon go?

405
00:36:15.730 --> 00:36:17.570
I spoke to Julia.

406
00:36:17.730 --> 00:36:19.450
So I heard.

407
00:36:19.610 --> 00:36:21.250
<i>I got lots of questions.</i>

408
00:36:21.410 --> 00:36:23.330
This stuff never ends, does it?

409
00:36:24.210 --> 00:36:27.970
It's all gonna make sense,
eventually.


410
00:36:29.770 --> 00:36:32.850
Everyone you meet here is
gonna show you something.


411
00:36:39.090 --> 00:36:41.090
John and Wil. Please, join us.

412
00:36:41.250 --> 00:36:43.730
We've got great people, great food.

413
00:36:43.890 --> 00:36:45.970
Everything is fresh from the garden.

414
00:36:51.570 --> 00:36:52.850
Miguel?

415
00:36:54.170 --> 00:36:56.850
Who's that man over there,
on the other side of the table?


416
00:36:57.010 --> 00:36:59.210
Jensen. He's an archaeologist.

417
00:36:59.370 --> 00:37:01.930
He's here on sabbatical.
A friend of a friend.


418
00:37:02.090 --> 00:37:05.610
- Would you like me to introduce you?
- No, no, no. Never mind.


419
00:37:21.690 --> 00:37:24.530
- I knew I'd find you here.
- Waiting for you.


420
00:37:26.530 --> 00:37:28.090
You seem happy.

421
00:37:28.290 --> 00:37:30.810
I am. Really good.

422
00:37:30.970 --> 00:37:33.690
I'm celebrating my fourth with Tom.

423
00:37:35.450 --> 00:37:40.330
Oh, come on, Wil.
You never had time for us anyway.


424
00:37:40.490 --> 00:37:44.410
True. But I'm glad for you and Tom.

425
00:37:44.570 --> 00:37:48.010
And you and I will always
be connected.


426
00:37:49.290 --> 00:37:50.530
University of Miami.

427
00:37:51.410 --> 00:37:53.730
Your Hurricanes crushed
my Bulldogs last year.


428
00:37:53.890 --> 00:37:54.970
I'm still not over it.

429
00:37:55.130 --> 00:37:58.250
Yeah. You got me.

430
00:37:58.410 --> 00:38:00.450
I teach there with Julia.

431
00:38:00.610 --> 00:38:03.610
I've been helping her with the
translations for about a year now.


432
00:38:03.770 --> 00:38:06.850
In fact, I was on my way back
when you saw me.


433
00:38:07.010 --> 00:38:09.050
That mean something,
that I saw you?


434
00:38:09.210 --> 00:38:13.010
Maybe. Maybe that we have
something to talk about, actually.


435
00:38:13.170 --> 00:38:14.610
If you believe the prophecy.

436
00:38:18.450 --> 00:38:20.570
You were thinking
about a child last time.


437
00:38:20.730 --> 00:38:22.650
You were going to adopt.

438
00:38:23.970 --> 00:38:26.130
It's not that easy.

439
00:38:26.290 --> 00:38:28.770
We've met a few children...

440
00:38:29.850 --> 00:38:32.330
...but I guess it has to be
the right one.


441
00:38:34.490 --> 00:38:36.290
It'll happen for you.

442
00:38:41.090 --> 00:38:43.970
Listen, I've been thinking about
Father Jose.


443
00:38:44.290 --> 00:38:47.490
He was too public about it.
I tried to tell him.


444
00:38:47.650 --> 00:38:49.210
Others have to know, Wil.

445
00:38:49.410 --> 00:38:52.050
They have to know about
the prophecy.


446
00:38:52.210 --> 00:38:53.890
Your friend John, for one.

447
00:38:54.410 --> 00:38:55.890
Yeah.

448
00:38:59.170 --> 00:39:00.890
What do you think of him?

449
00:39:01.250 --> 00:39:02.650
I think he'll get there.

450
00:39:04.930 --> 00:39:07.610
Unless, of course,
he gets too distracted.


451
00:39:07.770 --> 00:39:10.010
Julia told me that
you could see things happening...


452
00:39:10.170 --> 00:39:11.650
...when we talked in the garden.

453
00:39:11.810 --> 00:39:14.010
I glimpsed it, I guess.

454
00:39:14.170 --> 00:39:18.010
But to be honest,
I felt it more than anything.


455
00:39:18.930 --> 00:39:21.290
There's just something
so familiar about you, I can't...


456
00:39:21.450 --> 00:39:23.970
John, this player thing you do
really gets in your way.


457
00:39:24.130 --> 00:39:26.650
I'm not playing. Didn't you say
we were supposed to talk?


458
00:39:26.810 --> 00:39:29.930
God, it's amazing how easy it is to
lose yourself around some people.


459
00:39:30.090 --> 00:39:31.650
Why, are you losing yourself?

460
00:39:33.410 --> 00:39:34.690
I'm talking about you.

461
00:39:43.010 --> 00:39:44.810
Good night.

462
00:39:53.850 --> 00:39:56.610
We're going to do something
about Viciente.


463
00:39:58.770 --> 00:40:02.650
We intend to rid this country of
everyone involved with the prophecy.


464
00:40:04.130 --> 00:40:06.130
The opportunity is at hand...

465
00:40:06.290 --> 00:40:09.170
...to destroy all
the remaining translations.


466
00:40:10.250 --> 00:40:11.370
Who are you working for?

467
00:40:12.290 --> 00:40:13.890
You don't want to know.

468
00:40:14.290 --> 00:40:16.330
Just think of them as
powerful people...


469
00:40:16.490 --> 00:40:18.450
...who, like you,
have their own agenda.


470
00:40:19.650 --> 00:40:21.690
They are making many
investments here in Peru...


471
00:40:22.210 --> 00:40:23.770
...and they demand stability.

472
00:40:24.690 --> 00:40:27.210
We must cooperate.

473
00:40:31.570 --> 00:40:33.650
They wouldn't be helping you with...

474
00:40:34.050 --> 00:40:36.130
...your own political ambitions
as well?


475
00:40:36.730 --> 00:40:39.850
They see the prophecy
as disruptive.


476
00:40:40.450 --> 00:40:44.290
And it would seem that in this matter,
at least, your interests...


477
00:40:44.450 --> 00:40:46.450
...and theirs are the same.

478
00:40:53.250 --> 00:40:56.090
Viciente will cease to be a problem.

479
00:40:57.690 --> 00:40:59.250
It will all be over soon.

480
00:40:59.810 --> 00:41:02.770
I'm asking you not to interfere.

481
00:41:03.010 --> 00:41:04.490
Your Excellency.

482
00:41:19.050 --> 00:41:22.010
You and Marjorie have
come together for a reason, John.


483
00:41:22.210 --> 00:41:24.930
She's showing you the
third and fourth insights.


484
00:41:25.410 --> 00:41:27.810
The prophecy says
we'll stop building ourselves up...


485
00:41:27.970 --> 00:41:30.690
...by taking energy from others.

486
00:41:30.850 --> 00:41:36.450
There's another source, inside.
But we have to really connect with it.


487
00:41:36.610 --> 00:41:38.850
That's what Wil meant
when he said "open up."


488
00:41:39.290 --> 00:41:44.610
And if you open up enough, it literally
changes the way you see the world.


489
00:41:44.770 --> 00:41:48.210
But you have to really believe
the experience exists.


490
00:41:48.370 --> 00:41:51.170
Open yourself to the possibility that
there's something more...


491
00:41:51.330 --> 00:41:53.930
...right here in front of your eyes.

492
00:42:03.290 --> 00:42:05.130
Did you see that?

493
00:42:08.450 --> 00:42:11.010
Come on. I wanna show you
something over here.


494
00:42:20.210 --> 00:42:22.850
Wow, Julia, this place is so alive.

495
00:42:23.330 --> 00:42:24.770
It's amazing.

496
00:42:25.730 --> 00:42:28.130
Have a seat. Let's try something.

497
00:42:31.890 --> 00:42:33.890
Put your fingers together like this.

498
00:42:36.130 --> 00:42:37.890
- Okay.
- Go ahead.


499
00:42:38.290 --> 00:42:40.490
You're gonna look at the space
between your fingers.


500
00:42:43.010 --> 00:42:46.370
Relax your focus just a bit.
What do you see?


501
00:42:49.130 --> 00:42:50.770
Look closely.

502
00:42:51.970 --> 00:42:54.130
Let your eyes
go out of focus just a bit.


503
00:42:57.570 --> 00:42:58.850
What do you see?

504
00:43:01.490 --> 00:43:03.770
It's like a wisp of smoke
or something.


505
00:43:03.930 --> 00:43:06.770
That's the energy. 
Now look around.

506
00:43:08.610 --> 00:43:10.530
See that philodendron?

507
00:43:10.730 --> 00:43:14.410
It's the opposite of trying to make
something happen. Just let go.


508
00:43:15.810 --> 00:43:17.370
Take in the plant.

509
00:43:18.290 --> 00:43:22.690
The beauty, the color,
the way it stands out with presence.


510
00:43:23.970 --> 00:43:25.410
That's it.

511
00:43:28.530 --> 00:43:30.210
Breathe it in.

512
00:43:30.850 --> 00:43:33.090
Now take in more beauty.

513
00:43:34.610 --> 00:43:36.410
That's amazing.

514
00:43:36.930 --> 00:43:39.330
That's... Oh, hold on. I lost it.

515
00:43:39.690 --> 00:43:41.050
Here.

516
00:43:43.090 --> 00:43:44.050
Try again.

517
00:43:49.530 --> 00:43:51.970
Wow, that's incredible!

518
00:43:52.610 --> 00:43:53.930
Senor!

519
00:43:54.930 --> 00:43:57.090
Keep your focus, John.
You have to get this.


520
00:43:57.250 --> 00:44:00.090
Senor John! Senor John!

521
00:44:00.770 --> 00:44:03.090
Senor, the gentleman
in the second cottage...


522
00:44:03.250 --> 00:44:04.890
...he need to speak to you
immediately.


523
00:44:05.090 --> 00:44:06.850
He says very important.

524
00:44:18.730 --> 00:44:20.770
- John.
- Hi.


525
00:44:20.930 --> 00:44:23.170
Miguel told me all about you.

526
00:44:24.050 --> 00:44:26.970
Listen, there's something
I have to talk to you about.


527
00:44:28.450 --> 00:44:29.770
How much do you know about Wil?

528
00:44:30.210 --> 00:44:33.490
Wil. I only just recently met him.

529
00:44:33.730 --> 00:44:37.610
I'm sorry, but I have to tell you
Wil is wanted by the military police.


530
00:44:38.370 --> 00:44:39.770
What are you talking about?

531
00:44:39.970 --> 00:44:42.570
They are on the way
to arrest him now.


532
00:44:43.090 --> 00:44:46.210
But if you allow me, 
I can help you.

533
00:44:46.370 --> 00:44:47.690
How can you help me?

534
00:44:50.050 --> 00:44:52.770
Peru is a very dangerous place
for someone all alone.


535
00:44:52.930 --> 00:44:54.770
In over his head.

536
00:44:56.170 --> 00:44:58.370
I have official clearance
to study the prophecy.


537
00:44:58.530 --> 00:45:00.290
I can move around freely.

538
00:45:00.450 --> 00:45:03.930
But I need you to tell me what
you know. Where's the missing scroll?


539
00:45:05.610 --> 00:45:06.570
I don't know anything.

540
00:45:08.450 --> 00:45:10.210
But you're one of them, John.

541
00:45:10.370 --> 00:45:12.610
They all accept you.
You must know something.


542
00:45:12.770 --> 00:45:14.810
I can even get you back
to the United States...


543
00:45:15.010 --> 00:45:16.970
...if that's what you want.

544
00:45:17.890 --> 00:45:20.890
But you have to leave with me
right now, before the soldiers come.


545
00:45:23.450 --> 00:45:25.770
John. John.

546
00:45:26.690 --> 00:45:27.770
John.

547
00:45:29.290 --> 00:45:33.250
John. We have to go.

548
00:45:33.410 --> 00:45:35.010
Don't listen to him.

549
00:45:35.170 --> 00:45:38.130
Your survival depends
on your staying with me.


550
00:45:42.210 --> 00:45:43.810
Are you coming?

551
00:45:51.490 --> 00:45:53.050
Yeah.

552
00:45:54.850 --> 00:45:56.890
You're making a bad mistake,
both of you.


553
00:45:57.090 --> 00:45:59.970
He was undermining your confidence.
Taking your energy.


554
00:46:00.130 --> 00:46:03.090
Now you know what it feels like
when someone does it to you.


555
00:46:03.250 --> 00:46:05.410
I felt weak. I couldn't think.

556
00:46:05.570 --> 00:46:07.650
He's just a remote controller.

557
00:46:07.810 --> 00:46:09.930
But you're probably
gonna have to deal with him...


558
00:46:10.090 --> 00:46:12.050
...so you'd better figure it out.

559
00:46:12.570 --> 00:46:16.530
Wait. Is that in the prophecy too?

560
00:46:16.770 --> 00:46:20.250
There's a world of energy
that we are all going to understand.


561
00:46:20.450 --> 00:46:23.930
It's the real human condition.
Energy is what we all want.


562
00:46:24.090 --> 00:46:26.370
But we're stuck
battling for it with each other...


563
00:46:26.530 --> 00:46:28.970
...instead of finding it in ourselves.

564
00:46:29.170 --> 00:46:31.330
That's what you
still have to do, John.


565
00:46:31.690 --> 00:46:33.930
You haven't really
opened up, you know.


566
00:46:34.090 --> 00:46:35.730
Wil. Wil.

567
00:46:36.930 --> 00:46:39.130
John. The military is on its way.

568
00:46:39.290 --> 00:46:41.850
You need to leave.
Go while the north road is still open.


569
00:46:42.010 --> 00:46:44.450
- What about Julia and Marjorie?
- They've already left.


570
00:46:44.610 --> 00:46:47.330
You'll be behind them. I'm gonna
go to Lima, see the president.


571
00:46:47.490 --> 00:46:49.090
Maybe something can still be done.

572
00:46:49.250 --> 00:46:51.770
- Listen, you remember my cabin?
- In the rain forest, yes.


573
00:46:51.970 --> 00:46:54.650
It's probably the safest place
for you now.


574
00:46:55.010 --> 00:46:56.410
Wil.

575
00:46:58.090 --> 00:47:01.410
- Finish this thing.
- Yes.


576
00:47:03.330 --> 00:47:04.930
Good luck, Miguel.

577
00:47:20.690 --> 00:47:23.170
Forgive me for what
I've allowed to happen.


578
00:48:08.930 --> 00:48:11.010
Remember I told you
the way to Miguel's place?


579
00:48:11.170 --> 00:48:12.570
Yeah?

580
00:48:13.570 --> 00:48:17.530
If anything happens, you go there.
They'll need your help.


581
00:48:18.010 --> 00:48:20.730
- What about you?
- I have to keep going.


582
00:48:21.090 --> 00:48:23.410
I thought you were here
to find the ninth insight.


583
00:48:23.570 --> 00:48:25.530
Nothing's changed.

584
00:48:26.690 --> 00:48:29.450
Just keep learning, John.
You'll find help.


585
00:48:29.610 --> 00:48:30.650
There's always help.

586
00:48:30.850 --> 00:48:33.330
The right person
will come along if you stay alert.


587
00:48:34.130 --> 00:48:35.970
Something will happen for you.

588
00:48:54.530 --> 00:48:55.970
What was that?

589
00:48:58.250 --> 00:49:01.610
Rebels. Sit tight.

590
00:49:02.890 --> 00:49:04.850
It's Julia's car.

591
00:50:10.210 --> 00:50:11.650
My leg.

592
00:50:12.810 --> 00:50:14.210
Wait, wait!

593
00:50:14.650 --> 00:50:16.770
- Julia!
- I'm okay. Find the cabin.


594
00:50:16.930 --> 00:50:19.130
I've got the translations.

595
00:50:30.370 --> 00:50:31.890
How you feeling?

596
00:50:32.450 --> 00:50:33.930
- I'm terrified.
- You need to rest?


597
00:50:34.090 --> 00:50:36.450
No, no, let's keep going.

598
00:50:37.890 --> 00:50:39.970
- Is that Wil?
- What?


599
00:50:40.130 --> 00:50:41.770
- Stay here.
- No, no, John...


600
00:50:41.930 --> 00:50:43.650
I said, stay here!

601
00:50:52.290 --> 00:50:53.250
John!

602
00:50:56.370 --> 00:50:59.170
- John! Run!
- Marjorie!


603
00:51:59.490 --> 00:52:03.410
<i>Saint Francis could see beauty
where others couldn't.</i>


604
00:53:40.450 --> 00:53:44.250
I'm Father Sanchez. 
I can help you.

605
00:53:48.610 --> 00:53:51.210
I remember you
from a photograph I saw.


606
00:53:51.370 --> 00:53:52.850
You and Father Jose.

607
00:53:53.010 --> 00:53:55.810
Don't forget Wil. 
He was also there.

608
00:53:55.970 --> 00:53:59.050
Wil told me if I needed help,
someone would show up.


609
00:54:00.050 --> 00:54:01.930
I guess he meant you.

610
00:54:05.770 --> 00:54:08.250
Tell me what happened
on the cliffs, John.


611
00:54:10.250 --> 00:54:12.410
I knew I was gonna die...

612
00:54:14.770 --> 00:54:16.730
...so I just let go.

613
00:54:18.850 --> 00:54:20.650
Waited for the bullets.

614
00:54:24.130 --> 00:54:27.450
Then everything
began to change and I felt this...


615
00:54:27.890 --> 00:54:29.730
You had an amazing experience,
my friend.


616
00:54:29.890 --> 00:54:32.850
You opened up. 
You are changed.

617
00:54:33.290 --> 00:54:34.690
Did Wil explain this to you?

618
00:54:36.450 --> 00:54:37.730
He tried. I couldn't get it.

619
00:54:37.890 --> 00:54:39.690
Oh, you got more than you think.

620
00:54:40.130 --> 00:54:41.890
Tell me what you know.

621
00:54:43.490 --> 00:54:45.210
You mean the insights?

622
00:54:48.930 --> 00:54:54.050
Well, the first and the second
are about noticing the coincidences.


623
00:54:54.210 --> 00:54:56.410
Things happen for a reason.

624
00:54:57.690 --> 00:55:00.450
They're waking us up,
showing us the energy.


625
00:55:01.090 --> 00:55:02.850
And that's the third
and the fourth, right?


626
00:55:03.010 --> 00:55:05.730
I mean, that it's real
and people battle for it.


627
00:55:05.890 --> 00:55:07.810
Causes all the conflict in the world.

628
00:55:07.970 --> 00:55:09.930
Between nations,
in the workplace, families.


629
00:55:10.090 --> 00:55:11.970
There's only one solution.

630
00:55:13.450 --> 00:55:15.050
Opening up.

631
00:55:15.890 --> 00:55:17.850
Finding our own energy.

632
00:55:18.170 --> 00:55:19.610
Fifth insight.

633
00:55:19.810 --> 00:55:21.570
Connects you
with the one true source:


634
00:55:21.730 --> 00:55:23.290
The real world.

635
00:55:24.450 --> 00:55:26.290
But I lost it. Why?

636
00:55:26.450 --> 00:55:28.130
Well, the prophecy says...

637
00:55:28.770 --> 00:55:31.450
...when you find this true connection
with the energy of God...


638
00:55:31.610 --> 00:55:33.890
...it's like a glimpse into the future.

639
00:55:34.370 --> 00:55:38.330
One day, we'll all see that way,
live in that world.


640
00:55:38.530 --> 00:55:41.890
But now it's a difficult thing
for anyone to maintain.


641
00:55:42.090 --> 00:55:44.010
We are evolving in that direction.

642
00:55:44.810 --> 00:55:47.250
I saw the world's evolution.

643
00:55:49.050 --> 00:55:51.130
How it all came to be.

644
00:55:51.290 --> 00:55:54.530
My life seemed to be a part
of everything, right up to now.


645
00:55:54.770 --> 00:55:58.250
Everything made sense.
Growing up at the lake...


646
00:55:58.930 --> 00:56:01.370
...working with kids,
trying to understand history.


647
00:56:01.570 --> 00:56:03.650
I spent my life
thinking there was something more.


648
00:56:03.810 --> 00:56:08.290
That's the sixth insight. It says we are
part of a larger flow of evolution.


649
00:56:08.450 --> 00:56:10.090
We are here to do something.

650
00:56:10.250 --> 00:56:12.250
And if we are true to that purpose...

651
00:56:12.410 --> 00:56:15.170
...we'll help move humanity
towards the world you saw.


652
00:56:15.330 --> 00:56:17.250
But I don't know
what I'm supposed to do.


653
00:56:17.410 --> 00:56:19.170
That's because
you're not through yet.


654
00:56:20.370 --> 00:56:23.130
How to know what to do next
is the seventh.


655
00:56:24.450 --> 00:56:26.290
You have to discover your guidance.

656
00:56:28.930 --> 00:56:30.210
You're talking about hunches?

657
00:56:32.050 --> 00:56:33.690
Intuitions? I've seen Wil have those.

658
00:56:33.890 --> 00:56:37.210
If you stay alert,
you'll notice certain ideas...


659
00:56:37.370 --> 00:56:38.930
...images coming into your mind.

660
00:56:39.090 --> 00:56:41.010
They're there to guide you.

661
00:56:41.410 --> 00:56:44.570
Follow them and the coincidences
begin to increase.


662
00:56:44.730 --> 00:56:46.450
Just step into the flow.

663
00:56:46.610 --> 00:56:48.810
I don't think I've ever
experienced that before.


664
00:56:48.970 --> 00:56:52.050
You just need to open the door again.
Get some more energy.


665
00:56:52.210 --> 00:56:53.850
You remember
how you felt on the cliff?


666
00:56:54.010 --> 00:56:55.170
How the world looked?

667
00:56:56.490 --> 00:56:58.650
Just breathe in the memory.

668
00:57:18.330 --> 00:57:20.130
You were daydreaming.

669
00:57:21.090 --> 00:57:23.050
Yeah, I guess I was.

670
00:57:24.170 --> 00:57:25.890
What was coming to you?

671
00:57:28.290 --> 00:57:30.490
I was thinking about Marjorie.

672
00:57:31.410 --> 00:57:33.970
How it's my fault
that she got captured.


673
00:57:34.570 --> 00:57:36.450
What all were you seeing?

674
00:57:37.570 --> 00:57:40.130
- I don't know.
- No, come on, think.


675
00:57:40.290 --> 00:57:42.210
Most people
overlook these experiences.


676
00:57:44.010 --> 00:57:47.130
Well, it's the same thing
I saw yesterday on the mountain.


677
00:57:47.490 --> 00:57:49.490
And it felt like the future.

678
00:57:52.890 --> 00:57:58.370
She was in this place,
surrounded by dense jungle.


679
00:57:59.410 --> 00:58:00.850
Go on.

680
00:58:01.530 --> 00:58:03.610
Well, she was looking at something.

681
00:58:04.930 --> 00:58:07.650
A small flower.
A small yellow flower.


682
00:58:08.250 --> 00:58:09.890
Well, that's clear enough.

683
00:58:11.330 --> 00:58:12.930
Yeah, clear as mud.

684
00:58:13.090 --> 00:58:14.650
You know you have to do something.

685
00:58:14.850 --> 00:58:16.290
Except you don't know what.

686
00:58:16.450 --> 00:58:18.010
Then you have
this image of Marjorie.


687
00:58:18.210 --> 00:58:21.530
Well, that little daydream of yours
was a guidance.


688
00:58:22.690 --> 00:58:24.890
Okay. I'll buy that.

689
00:58:26.730 --> 00:58:28.490
What's it saying?

690
00:58:29.330 --> 00:58:31.530
You saw her in the rain forest?

691
00:58:32.930 --> 00:58:36.930
Well, the rain forest is that way.

692
00:58:37.770 --> 00:58:40.410
I don't know if I should do this.
Maybe I should go with you.


693
00:58:40.610 --> 00:58:42.570
There's no need. 
I can find Julia.

694
00:58:42.730 --> 00:58:47.570
You have to go your own way.
Follow your own intuition alone.


695
00:58:47.730 --> 00:58:50.530
We can't do anything without Marjorie,
so get moving. Find her.


696
00:58:50.690 --> 00:58:51.970
I'll see you at Miguel's cabin.

697
00:58:52.130 --> 00:58:53.890
Find her?
I don't know where I'm going!


698
00:58:54.050 --> 00:58:57.570
None of us know where we're going.
Not really. Just listen inside.


699
00:58:57.730 --> 00:59:01.970
Pay attention to the way things look.
Something will happen.


700
01:00:17.210 --> 01:00:20.450
Father Jose?
We thought you were dead.


701
01:00:20.610 --> 01:00:24.970
Well, things are not always
as they seem, John.


702
01:00:26.290 --> 01:00:30.050
I thought I was on the right path.
I guess I made a mistake.


703
01:00:30.210 --> 01:00:33.090
<i>It's a mistake
to think the worst too quickly.</i>


704
01:00:33.250 --> 01:00:37.650
Always find the deeper meaning,
the silver lining.


705
01:00:38.690 --> 01:00:41.330
That's what keeps you in the flow.

706
01:01:37.450 --> 01:01:39.930
- Marjorie.
- John.


707
01:01:42.930 --> 01:01:46.530
I don't know how this is happening.
It's just...


708
01:01:49.410 --> 01:01:50.490
Don't worry.

709
01:01:50.850 --> 01:01:53.290
- We're gonna get out of here.
- Okay.


710
01:03:01.050 --> 01:03:04.730
Okay. What now?

711
01:04:11.250 --> 01:04:13.090
This is it.

712
01:04:15.410 --> 01:04:16.570
Thank you.

713
01:04:19.930 --> 01:04:21.250
Okay.

714
01:04:28.130 --> 01:04:29.850
Okay.

715
01:04:32.570 --> 01:04:35.370
All right, I've been to Miguel's cabin
once before and I...


716
01:04:38.850 --> 01:04:40.810
Wanna know what I think?

717
01:04:41.090 --> 01:04:44.250
I think we should make for the border
and get out of Peru while we can.


718
01:04:44.410 --> 01:04:45.890
Have you forgotten why we're here?

719
01:04:46.050 --> 01:04:49.250
We could try to contact the others
when we get there. No more shooting.


720
01:04:49.410 --> 01:04:52.610
John, you're past this.
Listen to yourself.


721
01:04:52.770 --> 01:04:54.890
Now, I promise you,
I can find this place.


722
01:04:55.050 --> 01:04:57.050
You just give me a minute, all right?

723
01:04:59.970 --> 01:05:01.530
- No.
- Hold on.


724
01:05:01.690 --> 01:05:03.330
- It's too dangerous. Marjorie.
- Hold on.


725
01:05:03.490 --> 01:05:06.010
- Will you talk to me, please?
- You don't wanna talk.


726
01:05:06.210 --> 01:05:09.290
To talk, you'd have to actually listen
to what another person is feeling.


727
01:05:09.450 --> 01:05:11.210
- You're dense as a post.
- I'm trying to...


728
01:05:11.370 --> 01:05:13.570
You're controlling, John,
because you're scared...


729
01:05:13.730 --> 01:05:16.010
...and it's wearing me down.
It can't happen anymore.


730
01:05:16.170 --> 01:05:20.170
Not if I can help it. L...
John. Leave me alone.


731
01:06:01.690 --> 01:06:04.450
Hey, what took you so long?
Julia! They're here.


732
01:06:04.610 --> 01:06:05.970
You did it.

733
01:06:09.850 --> 01:06:13.370
- What's going on?
- Oh, it's okay. Don't ask.


734
01:06:16.930 --> 01:06:19.930
Come on, John, you did great.
Come on in.


735
01:06:38.850 --> 01:06:41.650
Come on, give me another chance.

736
01:06:43.610 --> 01:06:46.170
You're the one that's supposed to be
good at all this stuff.


737
01:06:46.370 --> 01:06:50.250
You are not making this easy on me.
I am doing the best I can...


738
01:06:50.410 --> 01:06:52.090
...but I don't have it figured out yet.

739
01:06:52.250 --> 01:06:55.010
You can start by calming down.

740
01:07:00.130 --> 01:07:03.010
I can be a little
hard-edged sometimes.


741
01:07:06.450 --> 01:07:08.570
I've always gotten lost
in other people.


742
01:07:08.730 --> 01:07:11.690
Guys. Mostly the charming ones.

743
01:07:11.850 --> 01:07:14.930
Not stood my ground
when it was really important...


744
01:07:15.090 --> 01:07:16.730
...and I vowed to myself,
not anymore...


745
01:07:16.930 --> 01:07:20.610
...and then you come along,
like it's some kind of test for me, and...


746
01:07:20.970 --> 01:07:26.370
...I just get angry because I don't
wanna slide backwards, John.


747
01:07:26.530 --> 01:07:27.970
Neither do I.

748
01:07:28.450 --> 01:07:31.650
That's why I wanna find out exactly
what happened and get through this.


749
01:07:32.810 --> 01:07:35.370
The couple thing is the hardest thing
to work out.


750
01:07:35.530 --> 01:07:37.450
Especially if the relationship
is familiar...


751
01:07:37.610 --> 01:07:39.970
...if it feels
like I've known you before.


752
01:07:44.090 --> 01:07:46.210
Did you think I didn't feel it?

753
01:07:54.130 --> 01:07:58.010
When couples first meet, usually
there is this wonderful feeling...


754
01:07:58.170 --> 01:08:00.130
...but it almost never lasts.

755
01:08:00.650 --> 01:08:02.810
One person gets insecure
and starts controlling...


756
01:08:02.970 --> 01:08:05.450
...wanting more
from the other person, and...


757
01:08:05.610 --> 01:08:10.690
...the other one gets threatened
and backs away...


758
01:08:10.850 --> 01:08:14.330
...and it leads to a power struggle.
- It doesn't have to be that way.


759
01:08:17.130 --> 01:08:18.850
No, it doesn't.

760
01:08:19.810 --> 01:08:21.450
I mean...

761
01:08:22.650 --> 01:08:24.690
...if both people stay connected...

762
01:08:24.850 --> 01:08:27.850
...then whoever has
the strongest intuition leads...


763
01:08:28.010 --> 01:08:31.490
...and there's no competition.

764
01:08:32.010 --> 01:08:34.690
Control is shared,
and that's the relationship I want.


765
01:08:34.850 --> 01:08:37.770
That's just it,
I can't stay connected.


766
01:08:40.250 --> 01:08:43.570
I want to, but I'm not there yet.

767
01:08:44.130 --> 01:08:45.770
But there is a way, John.

768
01:08:45.930 --> 01:08:49.090
And we all have to work on
doing this one critical thing.


769
01:08:49.250 --> 01:08:52.730
It's what I need to remember
instead of getting angry all the time.


770
01:08:54.810 --> 01:08:57.530
I mean, that's the eighth insight.

771
01:08:59.090 --> 01:09:00.250
Come here.

772
01:09:02.690 --> 01:09:08.450
It says that instead of taking energy
from each other, you give it.


773
01:09:08.610 --> 01:09:11.610
All the time, no matter what.

774
01:09:15.170 --> 01:09:17.610
Like Father Sanchez is doing.

775
01:09:19.010 --> 01:09:20.530
Look at him, John.

776
01:09:21.410 --> 01:09:23.210
Really look.

777
01:09:33.330 --> 01:09:35.650
Giving energy is a process.

778
01:09:35.810 --> 01:09:38.890
When someone's energy increases,
you can see it in their expression.


779
01:09:39.330 --> 01:09:41.650
So you look
for that higher expression.


780
01:09:41.810 --> 01:09:43.930
And in every situation...

781
01:09:44.090 --> 01:09:48.250
...you know your energy is moving
into them when you get a feeling.


782
01:09:49.050 --> 01:09:50.210
A feeling?

783
01:09:50.370 --> 01:09:54.490
On the cliff, when you opened up,
remember? What did you feel?


784
01:09:56.290 --> 01:09:59.570
I felt a kind of completeness.

785
01:10:00.090 --> 01:10:02.010
A wholeness. This...

786
01:10:03.570 --> 01:10:05.890
This unmatched euphoria.

787
01:10:07.890 --> 01:10:09.970
- You're talking about love, aren't you?
- Yes.


788
01:10:10.610 --> 01:10:12.890
Giving is the secret
to keeping yourself connected...


789
01:10:13.050 --> 01:10:15.330
...because your energy, your love...

790
01:10:15.570 --> 01:10:18.730
...builds up in you first
as it flows out to others.


791
01:10:18.890 --> 01:10:21.610
It's what the saints
have always known how to do.


792
01:10:22.050 --> 01:10:24.650
It's what you and I have to do now
to help them.


793
01:10:43.250 --> 01:10:44.970
Wait a minute.

794
01:10:46.250 --> 01:10:48.170
Maybe we're misreading this.

795
01:10:48.330 --> 01:10:49.930
Father Sanchez, 
John, come here.

796
01:10:50.090 --> 01:10:52.570
I found something
in the translations.


797
01:10:52.770 --> 01:10:56.090
Look at this. This phrase:

798
01:10:59.090 --> 01:11:02.930
- What does it mean?
- It means, roughly, to amplify.


799
01:11:03.130 --> 01:11:07.130
I thought it just referred to one person
giving energy to another.


800
01:11:07.730 --> 01:11:09.930
But now I think it's something more.

801
01:11:12.490 --> 01:11:15.610
<i>It's one thing to just give energy...</i>

802
01:11:15.770 --> 01:11:19.650
<i>... but if we give it to someone
who is also giving it back...</i>


803
01:11:19.810 --> 01:11:23.610
<i>... then we build energy
among ourselves.</i>


804
01:11:24.770 --> 01:11:28.450
<i>It amplifies, back and forth.</i>

805
01:11:31.650 --> 01:11:33.770
<i>It says if we were all doing this...</i>

806
01:11:33.930 --> 01:11:36.970
<i>... humanity would take another step
in evolution.</i>


807
01:11:43.170 --> 01:11:45.370
Does it say where we'll go?

808
01:11:46.130 --> 01:11:49.050
<i>Maybe that's what the ninth
is going to tell us.</i>


809
01:11:54.490 --> 01:11:57.850
That's it. Isn't it?

810
01:11:59.970 --> 01:12:02.130
That's where it's gonna happen.

811
01:12:19.050 --> 01:12:20.730
Hey, John, we have to get going.

812
01:12:26.130 --> 01:12:28.570
It'll take about two hours
to get to the ruins from here.


813
01:12:28.730 --> 01:12:31.090
Does anyone know
exactly where to start looking?


814
01:12:35.210 --> 01:12:37.570
There's someone who knows
exactly where to look.


815
01:13:42.410 --> 01:13:45.690
You got it all, John.
All the prophecy that we know.


816
01:13:45.850 --> 01:13:47.410
You've caught up.

817
01:13:55.010 --> 01:13:57.290
Now you live in our world.

818
01:14:14.090 --> 01:14:18.490
You could just let it go.
You don't owe anything to anyone.


819
01:14:20.130 --> 01:14:23.490
No, you go ahead.
I'll catch up with you.


820
01:14:26.370 --> 01:14:28.530
I think I have to go with him.

821
01:14:36.450 --> 01:14:40.090
- So why have you come here?
- To seek reconciliation.


822
01:14:40.250 --> 01:14:42.090
I want you to understand
the course I chose.


823
01:14:42.250 --> 01:14:45.850
There's nothing to understand.
All this talk about prophecy must end.


824
01:14:46.010 --> 01:14:48.050
The people have the right
to know what it says.


825
01:14:48.450 --> 01:14:51.570
It makes our religion,
it makes every religion, come alive.


826
01:14:52.050 --> 01:14:53.210
- Really?
- Of course.


827
01:14:53.410 --> 01:14:56.570
- Look what it's done to us.
- Hear me, please.


828
01:15:00.810 --> 01:15:05.410
From the time of Peter, the Church
has been about faith, about belief.


829
01:15:05.570 --> 01:15:08.170
We have kept that belief alive.

830
01:15:08.530 --> 01:15:10.770
But we can go past that now.

831
01:15:11.090 --> 01:15:14.450
We can begin to live the promises.
The kingdom can come now.


832
01:15:14.610 --> 01:15:16.170
It can all lead to chaos.

833
01:15:16.330 --> 01:15:19.410
No. The guidance inside
will prevent that.


834
01:15:19.570 --> 01:15:22.610
The perception can expand
and evolve.


835
01:15:23.050 --> 01:15:24.730
Evolve?

836
01:15:25.570 --> 01:15:27.850
Listen carefully
to what you are saying.


837
01:15:28.010 --> 01:15:30.970
We have always fought
against the idea of evolution.


838
01:15:31.170 --> 01:15:34.290
Against the idea
of evolution without God.


839
01:15:34.450 --> 01:15:38.210
But evolution is a creation
that's still happening.


840
01:15:38.370 --> 01:15:39.930
We can all participate.

841
01:15:40.130 --> 01:15:42.810
Don't lecture me about theology!

842
01:15:44.730 --> 01:15:47.090
Only God creates, not us.

843
01:15:47.250 --> 01:15:49.850
But it happens through us,
don't you see?


844
01:15:52.930 --> 01:15:55.490
You protected
the Franciscan documents.


845
01:15:55.650 --> 01:15:57.250
You showed us
where the scrolls were.


846
01:15:57.810 --> 01:16:00.450
They were placed in the ruins
for some reason.


847
01:16:00.610 --> 01:16:02.490
It's time to find out why.

848
01:16:02.810 --> 01:16:05.130
Please, join us.

849
01:16:07.290 --> 01:16:11.010
No. It must end.

850
01:16:11.490 --> 01:16:13.490
It doesn't matter now.

851
01:16:15.730 --> 01:16:20.770
There will be no ruins,
be no ninth insight. Nothing.


852
01:16:21.610 --> 01:16:23.170
What have you done?

853
01:16:23.930 --> 01:16:25.050
It's over.

854
01:16:25.850 --> 01:16:27.890
It's out of our hands now.

855
01:16:46.010 --> 01:16:47.570
Come on.
We need to find the others.


856
01:16:47.730 --> 01:16:50.850
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
It's Jensen.


857
01:16:52.530 --> 01:16:54.330
We gotta get moving.

858
01:16:55.090 --> 01:16:58.010
Remember you told me
I need to follow my own intuition?


859
01:17:01.810 --> 01:17:03.650
This is mine to do.

860
01:17:33.650 --> 01:17:35.250
So where's the ninth scroll?

861
01:17:39.610 --> 01:17:43.610
You should have come with me before,
when I gave you the chance.


862
01:17:44.290 --> 01:17:47.250
You're gonna destroy the ruins.
Aren't you?


863
01:17:47.850 --> 01:17:49.850
Let's just say
there are people out there...


864
01:17:50.010 --> 01:17:52.090
...who want certain things
to happen.


865
01:17:52.250 --> 01:17:54.570
Your prophecy isn't one of them.

866
01:17:54.810 --> 01:17:56.450
How did you think
this would end, huh?


867
01:17:56.610 --> 01:17:59.050
If you only knew
what the prophecy says...


868
01:17:59.210 --> 01:18:00.450
...how the world really is...

869
01:18:00.610 --> 01:18:03.050
The world is the way it is
because we make it that way.


870
01:18:03.210 --> 01:18:06.050
When there's prosperity, we create it.
When there's war...


871
01:18:06.210 --> 01:18:08.130
...well, sometimes war
can be useful too.


872
01:18:09.130 --> 01:18:12.570
- You wanna destroy this democracy?
- Not destroy.


873
01:18:12.730 --> 01:18:14.290
Limit.

874
01:18:14.450 --> 01:18:17.330
Progress depends
on people's willingness to be led.


875
01:18:18.050 --> 01:18:19.450
The world has changed.

876
01:18:19.650 --> 01:18:21.690
Religious fanatics
are threatening everything.


877
01:18:21.890 --> 01:18:25.090
Now this prophecy pops up again
after hundreds of years.


878
01:18:26.730 --> 01:18:30.050
Oh, yes. I know all about it.

879
01:18:30.210 --> 01:18:31.770
We have our writings too.

880
01:18:31.970 --> 01:18:34.170
We've always known the dangers
of what it promises.


881
01:18:34.330 --> 01:18:37.850
This dreamy liberation.
The illusion of security.


882
01:18:38.010 --> 01:18:39.250
It undermines everything.

883
01:18:39.410 --> 01:18:43.130
It's not an illusion. It's real.
It's the only thing that's real.


884
01:18:43.890 --> 01:18:46.210
Trying to control isn't the answer.

885
01:18:46.370 --> 01:18:48.770
When we find
the true God experience...


886
01:18:48.930 --> 01:18:52.170
...the fight over whose religion
is best, it fades.


887
01:18:53.050 --> 01:18:57.370
- There's just one truth.
- You people, so naive.


888
01:18:57.530 --> 01:19:01.050
Thinking there's something spiritual
guiding this world.


889
01:19:01.410 --> 01:19:04.290
Well, there's nothing out there.

890
01:19:04.450 --> 01:19:05.890
Just us humans.

891
01:19:06.050 --> 01:19:09.250
And those of us who know that
will always be in control.


892
01:19:12.410 --> 01:19:14.810
The way of this world...

893
01:19:16.010 --> 01:19:17.690
...is power.

894
01:19:24.290 --> 01:19:28.010
- Can't let you do this.
- You could never stop me.


895
01:19:34.050 --> 01:19:37.050
You idiot! You have killed us all!

896
01:20:13.010 --> 01:20:16.730
John, I found the others.
Let's get to the circle.


897
01:20:18.690 --> 01:20:20.730
I'll be right back.

898
01:20:25.890 --> 01:20:27.810
You feel that?

899
01:20:29.250 --> 01:20:30.970
It's happening.

900
01:20:36.930 --> 01:20:38.890
Someone's helping us.

901
01:20:40.930 --> 01:20:45.610
Send the energy back. It will build.
Remember?


902
01:21:02.570 --> 01:21:03.970
Oh, my...

903
01:21:05.330 --> 01:21:07.650
How incredible is this?

904
01:21:11.130 --> 01:21:12.930
I can read it.

905
01:21:14.610 --> 01:21:16.810
I can read this. It says:

906
01:21:17.170 --> 01:21:21.970
"The guidance within
evolves the world towards a...


907
01:21:22.130 --> 01:21:24.450
Towards a heaven
that is already here.


908
01:21:24.610 --> 01:21:27.650
To know this
is to know our destiny."


909
01:22:00.730 --> 01:22:03.970
- Wil?
- You made it here first.


910
01:22:04.290 --> 01:22:06.170
Wherever this is.

911
01:22:07.170 --> 01:22:08.890
You were helping us, weren't you?

912
01:22:09.250 --> 01:22:12.290
- Father Jose.
- He's been helping us too.


913
01:22:19.330 --> 01:22:21.370
They're all helping us.

914
01:22:21.770 --> 01:22:23.330
We are being shown heaven.

915
01:22:34.530 --> 01:22:36.650
It's where evolution is taking us.

916
01:22:36.810 --> 01:22:39.330
Where it's always been taking us.

917
01:22:43.330 --> 01:22:45.610
That's the ninth insight.

918
01:22:46.890 --> 01:22:49.490
No! Don't hurt her,
she's just a child.


919
01:22:50.290 --> 01:22:53.330
No, keep your energy.
Hold on, they'll see you.


920
01:22:54.210 --> 01:22:55.410
Julia.

921
01:23:00.090 --> 01:23:01.770
Stay focused. Keep your energy.

922
01:23:03.850 --> 01:23:05.330
John.

923
01:23:25.930 --> 01:23:28.410
Take them to the ridge!

924
01:24:03.810 --> 01:24:06.570
Marjorie? I wanna
tell you something.


925
01:24:06.730 --> 01:24:09.050
I don't think we have much time left.

926
01:24:09.810 --> 01:24:13.970
But I wanna thank you for all of it,
for everything you've shown me.


927
01:24:14.330 --> 01:24:17.210
I was a reluctant student at first,
I know, but I'm glad you...


928
01:24:17.370 --> 01:24:18.610
...didn't give up on me.

929
01:24:20.010 --> 01:24:22.450
I think I was the stubborn one.

930
01:24:24.610 --> 01:24:27.330
And, John, we weren't
supposed to be together.


931
01:24:27.490 --> 01:24:30.650
Not this time. We were just
supposed to find a balance.


932
01:24:33.650 --> 01:24:35.570
I think we did.

933
01:24:35.730 --> 01:24:37.130
Yeah.

934
01:24:53.210 --> 01:24:54.970
In the name of God. Wait!

935
01:24:55.450 --> 01:24:56.490
Lower your weapons!

936
01:24:58.010 --> 01:25:00.410
These people
can do you no harm now.


937
01:25:00.690 --> 01:25:03.010
They'll have no credibility.
I'm making sure of it.


938
01:25:03.170 --> 01:25:06.570
This is not your affair,
Your Excellency.


939
01:25:06.970 --> 01:25:08.370
No.

940
01:25:13.050 --> 01:25:17.170
Let them live. We're not murderers.
The prophecy has been destroyed.


941
01:25:18.170 --> 01:25:20.490
The jungle will take the ruins.

942
01:25:21.170 --> 01:25:23.610
Nothing is left of this prophecy.

943
01:25:23.810 --> 01:25:26.090
The prophecy is finished.

944
01:25:32.330 --> 01:25:33.610
Take them to Lima.

945
01:26:06.210 --> 01:26:07.810
I knew it was you.

946
01:26:10.210 --> 01:26:11.810
It's pretty intense in there.

947
01:26:11.970 --> 01:26:15.130
I have 45 minutes to leave the country.
They got me on the next plane out.


948
01:26:19.050 --> 01:26:20.250
What about the others?

949
01:26:20.610 --> 01:26:21.850
Marjorie?

950
01:26:22.010 --> 01:26:23.450
She's already back home.

951
01:26:23.650 --> 01:26:25.890
She was there to set you free.

952
01:26:26.810 --> 01:26:28.970
Julia and the girl,
they're all right too.


953
01:26:31.490 --> 01:26:32.730
Wil?

954
01:26:35.210 --> 01:26:37.250
The scrolls? The translations?
Anything left?


955
01:26:37.410 --> 01:26:38.930
They don't matter, John.

956
01:26:39.090 --> 01:26:41.090
We were able
to understand the ninth.


957
01:26:42.050 --> 01:26:44.770
Now we know
what life is really about.


958
01:26:45.250 --> 01:26:47.290
That changes everything.

959
01:26:49.290 --> 01:26:50.650
Here.

960
01:26:51.050 --> 01:26:53.050
I thought you'd find this interesting.

961
01:26:55.810 --> 01:26:58.010
How about that?
We made the news.


962
01:27:00.210 --> 01:27:02.450
She sent me here.

963
01:27:03.170 --> 01:27:05.690
Maybe now you can
have something real.


964
01:27:09.090 --> 01:27:10.530
Yeah.

965
01:27:12.090 --> 01:27:13.850
Maybe I can.

966
01:27:17.410 --> 01:27:19.930
So, what are you going to do now?

967
01:27:20.690 --> 01:27:22.650
I don't know. I don't know.

968
01:27:22.850 --> 01:27:25.210
You have to take all this
with you, John.


969
01:27:25.370 --> 01:27:27.570
You'll meet others
who have to know.


970
01:27:28.770 --> 01:27:30.730
Just keep your eyes open.

971
01:27:31.730 --> 01:27:33.970
Something will always happen.

972
01:27:44.130 --> 01:27:45.530
One last thing.

973
01:27:46.170 --> 01:27:48.930
Something tells me
you'll be getting a message.


974
01:27:49.890 --> 01:27:51.450
From Wil.

975
01:28:29.850 --> 01:28:31.450
Magazine?

976
01:28:32.090 --> 01:28:33.450
Thank you.

977
01:29:13.730 --> 01:29:15.170
There's a tenth insight.

978
01:29:20.170 --> 01:29:21.730
There's a tenth insight.
