Very interesting.

You little shit.

624
00:29:10.582 --> 00:29:12.584
I thought you were asleep.

AMY: Mmm...

627
00:29:17.788 --> 00:29:21.225
I guess that
I don't really see what
the big deal was, though.


628
00:29:21.258 --> 00:29:24.663
Like, when it happened,
you were both single.

Were both consenting adults.

Like...

631

I guess I'm just surprised.
it didn't happen sooner.


632
00:29:34.071 --> 00:29:38.309
Oh, well, we both agreed
that it was a mistake.

-Huh, really?
-Hmm.

Because that is not
what Dallas told me.

What did he tell you?

-Nothing.
-Not a thing.


640
00:29:57.494 --> 00:30:01.766
I was just wondering,
if you, you know...
Do you believe in Frogman?


641
00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:03.467
Yeah.

I believe in...
Everyone fucking
believes in Frogman.

anything about this...

That's a good point.

681

Can we agree that it's a frog?

682
00:31:41.533 --> 00:31:44.669
Yeah, there's...
you know, there's caves
like all around underneath here,

most of them are sealed up.

my cousin and I, we...
we know where to go.

outswim anybody.

the impregnation happens.

to take a maid here and there.

Yeah. Yeah, he does.

At least that's
what I would I assume.

in the bestiality thing.

Yeah, yeah, he does.

Is he an ancient god?

Or is he
an ancient alien, maybe?

trying to get his rocks off?

that is poison ivy.
