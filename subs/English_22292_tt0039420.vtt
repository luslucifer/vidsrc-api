1
00:01:50.102 --> 00:01:51.310
And now my mind is made up.

2
00:01:51.395 --> 00:01:52.395
Oh, Lucy.

3
00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:53.646
I never heard
of such a thing.


4
00:01:53.731 --> 00:01:54.981
Oh, Lucy, Lucy.

5
00:01:55.065 --> 00:01:56.983
Please don't make it
more difficult.


6
00:01:57.067 --> 00:01:59.944
I know you've tried to be
generous and kind,


7
00:02:00.028 --> 00:02:02.405
but it simply won't work,
my living here.


8
00:02:03.407 --> 00:02:04.490
Eva, speak to her.

9
00:02:04.575 --> 00:02:05.575
Are you serious, Lucy?

10
00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:06.826
Yes, Eva, I am.

11
00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:09.162
And poor Edwin
barely cold in his grave.


12
00:02:09.246 --> 00:02:10.997
He's been dead
almost a year now.


13
00:02:11.081 --> 00:02:14.083
Still you might have some consideration
for your husband's memory.


14
00:02:14.168 --> 00:02:17.336
I don't see what Edwin's
got to do with this.


15
00:02:17.421 --> 00:02:20.465
I'm not leaving him,
I'm leaving you.


16
00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:24.427
Oh! After all we've
tried to do for her.

17
00:02:24.511 --> 00:02:26.846
You mustn't think
I'm not grateful.


18
00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.348
You've both been
so very kind to me,


19
00:02:29.433 --> 00:02:31.809
but I'm not really
a member of the family,


20
00:02:31.894 --> 00:02:35.313
except for marrying your son,
and now he's gone.


21
00:02:35.397 --> 00:02:36.856
I have my own life to live,

22
00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.858
and you have yours,

23
00:02:38.942 --> 00:02:40.943
and they simply
won't mix.


24
00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.863
I've never had
a life of my own.


25
00:02:43.947 --> 00:02:48.826
It's been Edwin's life
and yours and Eva's,


26
00:02:48.911 --> 00:02:51.078
never my own.

27
00:02:51.163 --> 00:02:52.538
Stop sniveling, Mother.

28
00:02:52.623 --> 00:02:54.373
If she's determined
to make a fool of herself,


29
00:02:54.458 --> 00:02:55.833
there's nothing
we can do about it.


30
00:02:55.918 --> 00:02:59.837
But what will I have to
remind me of poor Edwin?


31
00:03:00.464 --> 00:03:03.216
Lucy, have you
considered Anna?


32
00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.301
Yes, Eva, I have.

33
00:03:05.385 --> 00:03:08.638
You're willing to take responsibility
for what might become of her?


34
00:03:08.722 --> 00:03:10.598
She's my daughter, Eva.

35
00:03:10.682 --> 00:03:12.809
And what do you
mean by that?


36
00:03:12.893 --> 00:03:14.310
Only what I said.

37
00:03:14.394 --> 00:03:16.979
You're insinuating
that I interfere with Anna.


38
00:03:17.731 --> 00:03:19.524
Don't deny it, Lucy.

39
00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:22.735
Don't deny it, I say!

40
00:03:23.111 --> 00:03:25.071
I'm not denying it, Eva.

41
00:03:27.658 --> 00:03:30.868
Please, can't we discuss this
without quarreling?


42
00:03:30.953 --> 00:03:33.371
I'm sure I don't know
how you'll manage, Lucy.


43
00:03:33.455 --> 00:03:34.747
You haven't any money.

44
00:03:34.832 --> 00:03:37.375
I have the income
from Edwin's gold shares.


45
00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:40.878
Anna and I can live
quite cheaply with Martha.


46
00:03:40.963 --> 00:03:43.130
Do you mean you're
taking Martha Huggins?


47
00:03:43.215 --> 00:03:46.884
And why not? She was with me
before I came to live with you.


48
00:03:46.969 --> 00:03:48.344
Of all the ungrateful...

49
00:03:48.428 --> 00:03:52.348
Please, Eva.
I'm sorry, but I've made up my mind.


50
00:03:52.432 --> 00:03:55.852
But where, Lucy,
where can you go?


51
00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.563
The seaside, I think.

52
00:03:58.647 --> 00:04:01.440
I've always wanted
to live by the sea.


53
00:04:01.525 --> 00:04:02.608
Oh, goody.

54
00:04:04.528 --> 00:04:06.445
Well, that's all I have to say.

55
00:04:06.697 --> 00:04:08.281
I should think
it's quite enough.


56
00:04:08.365 --> 00:04:10.783
Apparently there's
nothing we can do about it,


57
00:04:10.868 --> 00:04:12.368
but when you realize
your mistake


58
00:04:12.452 --> 00:04:14.370
and try to come
crawling back to us,


59
00:04:14.454 --> 00:04:16.372
don't expect
any encouragement from me.


60
00:04:16.456 --> 00:04:18.207
I won't, Eva.

61
00:04:28.427 --> 00:04:30.887
Well, it's done.

62
00:04:30.971 --> 00:04:33.764
Oh, it's a blooming revolution, that's what.

63
00:04:46.987 --> 00:04:50.072
Isn't Whitecliff beautiful, Martha?

64
00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:11.802
Oh, I am sorry.

65
00:05:12.429 --> 00:05:13.888
It's quite all right.

66
00:05:13.972 --> 00:05:15.222
Are you Mr. Itchen?

67
00:05:15.307 --> 00:05:17.224
Mr. Itchen passed on

68
00:05:17.309 --> 00:05:18.517
May he rest in peace.

69
00:05:18.602 --> 00:05:20.561
- Mr. Boles?
- Likewise.


70
00:05:20.646 --> 00:05:22.021
Then you're Mr. Coombe.

71
00:05:22.105 --> 00:05:23.230
Junior.

72
00:05:23.315 --> 00:05:26.108
Of course. You answered my letter.
Please eat.


73
00:05:26.193 --> 00:05:27.234
Thank you.

74
00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:28.527
I'm Mrs. Muir.

75
00:05:28.612 --> 00:05:31.656
Mrs. Muir, of course.
You were desirous of renting a house.


76
00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:32.907
Yes.

77
00:05:32.991 --> 00:05:35.034
Well, I've selected
several prospects


78
00:05:35.118 --> 00:05:39.080
suitable to a young lady
in bereaved circumstances.


79
00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.377
Bowles Yard. Seaside villa.
Three beds, two recept,


80
00:05:44.461 --> 00:05:46.379
complete offices,
company's gas and water,


81
00:05:46.463 --> 00:05:49.256
ideally sits near bus stops,
modern drains, private garden,


82
00:05:49.341 --> 00:05:51.884
£120. £10 deposit.

83
00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:53.886
I'm afraid that's
a little too expensive.


84
00:05:53.971 --> 00:05:55.054
Right.

85
00:05:59.393 --> 00:06:02.144
Labernum Mount.
First-class residential street,


86
00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:04.647
four bed, one recept,
sun parlor, offices,


87
00:06:04.731 --> 00:06:07.650
company's gas and water,
beautifully planted, short walk...


88
00:06:07.734 --> 00:06:10.403
This one. Gull Cottage.

89
00:06:10.487 --> 00:06:13.155
- What was that, madam?
- This house. Gull Cottage.


90
00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:14.907
It's exactly the sort
of place I'm looking for.

91
00:06:14.992 --> 00:06:17.785
Gull Cottage. Oh, no, no.
That wouldn't suit you at all.


92
00:06:17.869 --> 00:06:20.663
Labernum Mount.
First-class residential street,


93
00:06:20.747 --> 00:06:22.665
four bed, one recept,
sun parlor, offices,


94
00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:24.166
company's gas and water...

95
00:06:24.251 --> 00:06:27.670
And only £52.
That's very little for a furnished house.


96
00:06:27.754 --> 00:06:29.171
It's a ridiculous price.

97
00:06:29.256 --> 00:06:31.674
I suppose there's something wrong.

98
00:06:32.676 --> 00:06:34.010
Is it the drains?

99
00:06:34.678 --> 00:06:37.263
When Itchen, Boles, & Coombe
put up a house for rent,


100
00:06:37.347 --> 00:06:40.725
you may be sure there is
nothing wrong with the drains.


101
00:06:40.809 --> 00:06:42.268
Then why shouldn't it suit me?

102
00:06:42.352 --> 00:06:45.688
My dear young lady, you must
allow me to be the judge of that.


103
00:06:45.772 --> 00:06:47.773
Now where were we?
Oh, yes. Labernum Mount.


104
00:06:47.858 --> 00:06:49.775
Beautifully planted,
short walk from...


105
00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:51.777
But if I'm going to
live in the house,


106
00:06:51.862 --> 00:06:53.279
I should be the judge.

107
00:06:53.363 --> 00:06:54.947
You'll only waste your time.

108
00:06:55.032 --> 00:06:56.782
But it's my time.

109
00:06:56.867 --> 00:06:59.285
I believe there's another
house agency in Whitecliff.


110
00:06:59.369 --> 00:07:02.580
Perhaps they have
Gull Cottage listed, too.


111
00:07:03.206 --> 00:07:05.416
Very well, madam, if you insist.

112
00:07:10.422 --> 00:07:13.090
I shall drive you to Gull Cottage
in my motorcar.


113
00:07:13.175 --> 00:07:15.217
That's very good of you,
Mr. Coombe.


114
00:07:54.758 --> 00:07:56.092
Mrs. Muir.

115
00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.971
It's only a short drive
to Labernum Mount.


116
00:08:01.056 --> 00:08:03.015
But I want to see the inside.

117
00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:04.517
The inside?

118
00:08:04.601 --> 00:08:08.020
Of course.
What on earth's the matter?


119
00:08:08.105 --> 00:08:10.189
Very well.
If you insist.


120
00:08:30.836 --> 00:08:32.002
Terribly dusty.

121
00:08:32.087 --> 00:08:33.754
The house has been empty
for nearly four years.


122
00:08:35.132 --> 00:08:37.299
Office is back there.
Living on the right.


123
00:08:37.384 --> 00:08:39.301
Dining off the living.

124
00:08:50.188 --> 00:08:53.315
Oh. Of course. 
It's a painting.

125
00:08:55.652 --> 00:08:57.570
I thought for a moment...

126
00:08:59.573 --> 00:09:00.990
Who is it?

127
00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:05.411
The former owner,
a Captain Gregg.


128
00:09:05.495 --> 00:09:06.912
A sea captain.

129
00:09:07.789 --> 00:09:10.207
That explains the scheme
of decoration, doesn't it?


130
00:09:10.292 --> 00:09:11.750
Which is in frightful taste.

131
00:09:11.835 --> 00:09:13.961
I don't agree with you.

132
00:09:14.045 --> 00:09:16.088
It's really a lovely room,

133
00:09:16.173 --> 00:09:18.090
and most of the furniture
will do as it is.


134
00:09:18.175 --> 00:09:20.885
Mrs. Muir, I must beg of you
not to be so precipitous.


135
00:09:20.969 --> 00:09:23.637
I assure you this house
will not suit you at all.


136
00:09:23.722 --> 00:09:27.892
Oh, but it does.
It suits me perfectly.


137
00:09:27.976 --> 00:09:29.727
What a hideous tree.

138
00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:32.021
What kind of a tree is it?

139
00:09:32.105 --> 00:09:34.356
I believe it is called
a monkey puzzle tree.


140
00:09:34.441 --> 00:09:35.566
Why?

141
00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:39.028
Because it defies the efforts
of monkeys to climb it, presumably.


142
00:09:39.112 --> 00:09:42.198
Why, it ruins the view.
I'll have it chopped down.


143
00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:49.538
Did you say something,
Mr. Coombe?


144
00:09:49.623 --> 00:09:51.040
No, I did not.

145
00:09:54.544 --> 00:09:56.879
Well, I think I'd better
see the rest of it.


146
00:09:56.963 --> 00:09:58.881
As you wish, Mrs. Muir.

147
00:10:27.911 --> 00:10:29.328
What on earth?

148
00:10:29.412 --> 00:10:30.746
What, Mrs. Muir?

149
00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:34.250
That table.
I thought you said no one had been here.


150
00:10:34.334 --> 00:10:35.668
I said nothing of the sort.

151
00:10:35.752 --> 00:10:38.254
I said the house
had been empty. It has.

152
00:10:38.338 --> 00:10:39.797
A charwoman was here last week.

153
00:10:39.881 --> 00:10:42.007
Well, she must have left
in a frightful hurry.


154
00:10:42.092 --> 00:10:43.384
That she did.

155
00:10:43.468 --> 00:10:44.551
Did she tell you why?

156
00:10:44.636 --> 00:10:45.678
She told me nothing.

157
00:10:45.762 --> 00:10:48.681
She returned the key to the office
whilst I was out.


158
00:10:51.184 --> 00:10:52.268
Mrs. Muir, I...

159
00:10:52.352 --> 00:10:54.770
I know, it won't suit me.
But it does.


160
00:10:58.275 --> 00:11:00.484
I'd like to see the upstairs.

161
00:11:01.111 --> 00:11:03.112
The upstairs.

162
00:11:24.301 --> 00:11:26.176
The, uh, main bedroom.

163
00:11:41.443 --> 00:11:42.776
Of course.

164
00:11:43.903 --> 00:11:45.988
He liked to watch the ships.

165
00:11:47.324 --> 00:11:48.824
But what...

166
00:11:50.285 --> 00:11:53.912
That's what it is.
You're clean.


167
00:11:53.997 --> 00:11:55.581
I beg your pardon,
Mrs. Muir.


168
00:11:55.665 --> 00:11:58.375
Oh, not you, Mr. Coombe,
the telescope.


169
00:12:02.005 --> 00:12:03.881
Did you laugh,
Mr. Coombe?


170
00:12:06.968 --> 00:12:08.385
Mr. Coombe?

171
00:12:26.196 --> 00:12:28.447
You would come.
I didn't want to show it to you,


172
00:12:28.531 --> 00:12:30.199
but, oh, no, no,
you had to see it.


173
00:12:30.283 --> 00:12:34.286
Haunted.
How perfectly fascinating.


174
00:12:35.038 --> 00:12:36.163
Fascinating?

175
00:12:36.873 --> 00:12:40.292
I suppose it's fascinating that
this house is driving me to drink.


176
00:12:40.377 --> 00:12:42.920
To drink!
Four times I've rented it


177
00:12:43.004 --> 00:12:45.923
and four times the tenants have left
after the very first night.


178
00:12:46.007 --> 00:12:48.425
The owner's in Australia,
Captain Gregg's cousin.


179
00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:51.136
I've written to him, cabled him
begging him to release me,


180
00:12:51.221 --> 00:12:53.347
but he only replies,
"Rely on you."


181
00:12:53.431 --> 00:12:55.099
Well, I don't want
to be relied on.


182
00:12:55.225 --> 00:12:57.434
I never want to see
this house again.


183
00:12:57.519 --> 00:12:59.937
I wish Captain Gregg
had lived to be 100.


184
00:13:00.021 --> 00:13:01.939
I wish he'd never been born.

185
00:13:02.023 --> 00:13:03.857
I'm terribly sorry,
Mr. Coombe.


186
00:13:03.942 --> 00:13:06.860
Well, at least you know now
why it won't suit you.


187
00:13:06.945 --> 00:13:09.571
Yes, I suppose so.

188
00:13:11.116 --> 00:13:14.118
Why does he haunt?
Was he murdered?


189
00:13:14.202 --> 00:13:16.245
No, he committed suicide.

190
00:13:17.288 --> 00:13:18.872
I wonder why.

191
00:13:18.957 --> 00:13:21.667
To save someone the trouble
of assassinating him, no doubt.


192
00:13:21.751 --> 00:13:23.836
Come. We'll go to Labernum Mount.

193
00:13:27.799 --> 00:13:29.466
Mrs. Muir.

194
00:13:30.552 --> 00:13:32.761
Mrs. Muir, if you please.

195
00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:37.182
You'll probably think it very silly of me,
Mr. Coombe,


196
00:13:37.267 --> 00:13:40.394
but I've decided to take
Gull Cottage after all.


197
00:13:40.478 --> 00:13:43.772
I mean, if everyone rushes off
at the slightest sound,


198
00:13:43.857 --> 00:13:45.899
of course the house
gets a bad name.


199
00:13:45.984 --> 00:13:47.651
But it's too ridiculous, really,

200
00:13:47.735 --> 00:13:49.903
in the 20th century,
to believe in apparitions


201
00:13:49.988 --> 00:13:51.697
and all that
medieval nonsense.


202
00:13:51.781 --> 00:13:53.323
But you heard him laugh.

203
00:13:53.408 --> 00:13:55.909
I heard what might
have been a laugh.


204
00:13:55.994 --> 00:13:58.412
It might have been the wind
roaring down the chimney.


205
00:13:58.496 --> 00:14:00.914
If I may so say, Mrs. Muir,
fiddlesticks.


206
00:14:00.999 --> 00:14:02.875
I want Gull Cottage.

207
00:14:02.959 --> 00:14:06.879
In my opinion, you are the most
obstinate young woman I have ever met.


208
00:14:06.963 --> 00:14:08.380
Thank you, Mr. Coombe.

209
00:14:08.465 --> 00:14:11.717
I've always wanted
to be considered obstinate.


210
00:14:11.801 --> 00:14:14.386
Very well, Mrs. Muir,

211
00:14:14.471 --> 00:14:17.890
on the understanding
that I disclaim all responsibility


212
00:14:17.974 --> 00:14:19.892
of what may happen,

213
00:14:19.976 --> 00:14:21.894
you shall have Gull Cottage.

214
00:14:32.906 --> 00:14:35.324
Don't you dare come in.

215
00:14:38.661 --> 00:14:41.872
Bringing your muddy feet
through my nice clean kitchen.


216
00:14:41.956 --> 00:14:43.790
Landlubber.

217
00:14:43.875 --> 00:14:45.709
There.

218
00:14:45.793 --> 00:14:48.420
Nothing like soap and water
to make everything shipshape


219
00:14:48.505 --> 00:14:49.922
in Bristol fashion.

220
00:14:50.006 --> 00:14:51.423
Yes.

221
00:14:51.508 --> 00:14:53.425
What did you say, Martha?

222
00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:55.427
Why, I said...

223
00:14:56.346 --> 00:14:57.429
What did I say?

224
00:14:57.514 --> 00:14:59.431
Shipshape in Bristol fashion.

225
00:14:59.516 --> 00:15:02.267
I've never heard you use
that expression before.


226
00:15:03.686 --> 00:15:05.562
Must have been
the sea air.


227
00:15:06.439 --> 00:15:07.856
Come along, Mrs. Muir.

228
00:15:07.941 --> 00:15:09.525
I'll have that iron,
if you please.


229
00:15:09.609 --> 00:15:10.943
But I've nearly finished.

230
00:15:11.027 --> 00:15:13.570
You've done enough
hard work for today.


231
00:15:13.655 --> 00:15:15.948
Besides, you know,
you're supposed not to be...


232
00:15:16.032 --> 00:15:18.367
If you're going to start
telling me I'm not strong,


233
00:15:18.451 --> 00:15:21.161
I'll pack you off back to London
on the first train.


234
00:15:21.246 --> 00:15:23.372
Dear old London,
how I miss it.


235
00:15:23.456 --> 00:15:25.791
Now come along,
upstairs to your room


236
00:15:25.875 --> 00:15:28.293
and a bit of shut-eye
before tea.


237
00:15:30.255 --> 00:15:32.047
I feel so useless.

238
00:15:32.966 --> 00:15:35.217
Here I am nearly
halfway through life,


239
00:15:35.301 --> 00:15:36.843
and what have I done?

240
00:15:36.928 --> 00:15:38.387
I know what I done,
all right.


241
00:15:38.471 --> 00:15:41.431
Cooked enough steaks
to choke an hippopotamus


242
00:15:41.516 --> 00:15:44.476
and kept the name of Huggins
as fair as the day I found it.


243
00:15:44.561 --> 00:15:47.396
You've led
a very useful life, Martha.


244
00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:49.398
I have nothing to show
for all my years.


245
00:15:49.482 --> 00:15:51.817
I suppose you call
Miss Anna nothing.


246
00:15:51.901 --> 00:15:55.153
Oh, heavens.
I can't take any credit for her.


247
00:15:55.238 --> 00:15:57.406
She just happened.

248
00:15:57.490 --> 00:15:58.824
Yes.

249
00:15:58.908 --> 00:16:01.618
That's what my old mum
always used to say.


250
00:16:01.703 --> 00:16:03.579
I was the 11th.

251
00:16:08.418 --> 00:16:09.543
Hurt yourself?

252
00:16:09.627 --> 00:16:10.752
Here, let's have a look.

253
00:16:10.837 --> 00:16:13.130
It's nothing,
just a scrape.


254
00:16:13.256 --> 00:16:16.425
But I am tired. 
I think I will take a little rest.

255
00:16:18.344 --> 00:16:21.263
Begging your pardon,
Your Highness.


256
00:16:24.434 --> 00:16:25.892
There.

257
00:16:27.437 --> 00:16:30.355
This will keep you
nice and warm.


258
00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:34.192
Thanks, Martha,
you're an angel.


259
00:16:35.445 --> 00:16:38.196
Ain't noticed any wings
sproutin' lately.


260
00:16:43.036 --> 00:16:45.787
I'll call you in plenty
of time for tea.


261
00:18:33.354 --> 00:18:34.521
It's you.

262
00:18:35.565 --> 00:18:38.150
I crept up, not
wanting to wake you


263
00:18:38.234 --> 00:18:40.527
in case you
was still asleep.


264
00:18:41.446 --> 00:18:42.863
Tea's all ready.

265
00:18:42.947 --> 00:18:45.907
Miss Anna will have it all
cleared off in no time


266
00:18:45.992 --> 00:18:47.367
if you don't hurry.

267
00:18:47.452 --> 00:18:48.994
I've got a nice bit
of fresh fish for you, too.


268
00:18:49.078 --> 00:18:52.497
Martha, I had such a curious dream.

269
00:18:53.791 --> 00:18:56.418
Did I close the window
before I went to sleep?


270
00:18:56.502 --> 00:19:00.380
You did, and scraped your finger.
Don't you remember?


271
00:19:00.465 --> 00:19:02.007
It's shut now, ain't it?

272
00:19:02.967 --> 00:19:04.342
Yes.

273
00:19:08.639 --> 00:19:10.098
It's shut now.

274
00:19:25.448 --> 00:19:27.199
Sleep tight.

275
00:19:27.283 --> 00:19:30.827
Good night, Mummy.
I love the sea, and so does Rummy.


276
00:19:30.912 --> 00:19:32.329
And so do I.

277
00:19:50.807 --> 00:19:52.891
I put hot water bottles
on the kitchen table, ma'am,


278
00:19:52.975 --> 00:19:54.309
and the kettle's
on the stove.


279
00:19:54.393 --> 00:19:55.477
Thank you, Martha.

280
00:19:55.561 --> 00:19:57.312
- Good night, ma'am.
- Good night.


281
00:19:58.481 --> 00:19:59.981
Should I leave this on, ma'am?

282
00:20:00.066 --> 00:20:02.192
No. This will do nicely.

283
00:21:38.915 --> 00:21:40.999
I know you're here.

284
00:21:47.506 --> 00:21:49.549
I say, I know you're here.

285
00:21:51.928 --> 00:21:55.722
What's wrong?
Are you afraid to speak up?


286
00:21:57.183 --> 00:22:00.268
Is that all you're good for,
to frighten women?


287
00:22:01.896 --> 00:22:03.688
Well, I'm not afraid of you.

288
00:22:05.650 --> 00:22:08.068
Whoever heard
of a cowardly ghost?


289
00:22:10.696 --> 00:22:12.405
Now if the demonstration is over,

290
00:22:12.490 --> 00:22:15.033
I'll thank you not to interfere
while I boil some water


291
00:22:15.117 --> 00:22:16.826
for my hot water bottle.

292
00:22:16.911 --> 00:22:18.912
Light the candle.

293
00:22:20.581 --> 00:22:22.832
Go ahead, light it.

294
00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:27.879
How can I when you keep
blowing out the match?


295
00:22:27.964 --> 00:22:30.548
Light the blasted candle!

296
00:22:47.233 --> 00:22:48.650
Well?

297
00:22:51.487 --> 00:22:54.864
You'll forgive me
if I take a moment


298
00:22:54.949 --> 00:22:57.784
to get accustomed to you.

299
00:23:02.248 --> 00:23:03.832
You're Captain Gregg.

300
00:23:04.542 --> 00:23:05.834
Aye.

301
00:23:06.669 --> 00:23:08.962
I'm sorry I called you names,

302
00:23:10.006 --> 00:23:12.132
coward and so forth.

303
00:23:12.216 --> 00:23:15.343
I didn't really believe in you,
or I wouldn't have.


304
00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:18.263
It must have been
embarrassing to you.


305
00:23:18.347 --> 00:23:19.764
Why?

306
00:23:20.349 --> 00:23:23.727
Why, I mean because
of the way you died.


307
00:23:27.023 --> 00:23:28.982
The way I died, madam?

308
00:23:29.066 --> 00:23:32.360
I mean because
you committed suicide.


309
00:23:33.696 --> 00:23:35.822
What made you think
I committed suicide?


310
00:23:35.906 --> 00:23:36.990
Mr. Coombe said...

311
00:23:37.074 --> 00:23:40.326
Coombe's a fool.
They're all fools.


312
00:23:40.411 --> 00:23:43.830
I went to sleep in front of that
confounded gas heater in my bedroom,


313
00:23:43.914 --> 00:23:47.876
and I must have kicked the gas on
with my foot in my sleep.


314
00:23:48.377 --> 00:23:50.670
It was a stormy night like this

315
00:23:50.755 --> 00:23:53.423
with half a gale blowing from
the south-southwest into my windows,


316
00:23:53.507 --> 00:23:55.842
so I shut them as
any sensible man would.


317
00:23:55.926 --> 00:23:57.135
Wouldn't you?

318
00:23:57.219 --> 00:23:59.888
Yes, I suppose so.

319
00:24:00.222 --> 00:24:02.348
Then the coroner's jury
brought in a suicide


320
00:24:02.433 --> 00:24:04.809
because me blasted
charwoman testified


321
00:24:04.894 --> 00:24:06.811
I always slept
with me windows open.


322
00:24:07.313 --> 00:24:09.856
How the devil should
she know how I slept?


323
00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:11.733
I'm so glad.

324
00:24:12.526 --> 00:24:15.070
Do you have a strange
sense of humor, madam?


325
00:24:15.154 --> 00:24:18.364
I mean because you
didn't commit suicide,


326
00:24:19.241 --> 00:24:22.285
but if you didn't,
why do you haunt?


327
00:24:22.369 --> 00:24:25.288
Because I have plans
for me house


328
00:24:25.372 --> 00:24:27.290
which don't include
a pack of strangers barging in


329
00:24:27.374 --> 00:24:28.500
and making themselves at home.

330
00:24:28.584 --> 00:24:30.502
Then you were trying
to frighten me away.


331
00:24:30.586 --> 00:24:34.798
You call that trying?
I'd barely started.


332
00:24:34.882 --> 00:24:37.133
No, that was enough
for all the others.


333
00:24:37.218 --> 00:24:39.511
They didn't want any part of it,
let me tell you.


334
00:24:39.595 --> 00:24:41.179
Didn't even stop
to weigh anchor.


335
00:24:41.263 --> 00:24:43.348
They just cut their cables and ran.

336
00:24:43.432 --> 00:24:46.142
I think it's very mean
of you frightening people,


337
00:24:46.227 --> 00:24:47.811
childish, too.

338
00:24:47.895 --> 00:24:49.813
In your case,
I'm prepared to admit


339
00:24:49.897 --> 00:24:52.816
I charted the course
with regret.


340
00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:54.818
You're not a bad-looking
woman, you know,


341
00:24:54.902 --> 00:24:56.820
especially
when you're asleep.


342
00:24:56.904 --> 00:25:00.323
So you were in my room
this afternoon.


343
00:25:00.407 --> 00:25:01.866
My room, madam.

344
00:25:01.951 --> 00:25:05.745
I thought I'd dreamed it.
Did you open the window to frighten me?


345
00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:07.997
I opened the window because
I didn't want another accident


346
00:25:08.082 --> 00:25:09.874
with the blasted gas.

347
00:25:10.626 --> 00:25:12.460
Women are such fools.

348
00:25:13.963 --> 00:25:16.923
You, of all people,
should not have brought that up.


349
00:25:18.217 --> 00:25:20.969
I wouldn't call that remark
in the best of taste.


350
00:25:21.053 --> 00:25:23.471
Well, I'm sure it
was very kind of you,


351
00:25:23.556 --> 00:25:26.975
but I am quite capable
of taking care of myself.


352
00:25:27.893 --> 00:25:30.311
Now, if you don't mind.

353
00:25:42.825 --> 00:25:44.492
Well, what's the matter now?

354
00:25:44.577 --> 00:25:46.828
I just wanted to see
if you were really there.


355
00:25:46.954 --> 00:25:48.872
Of course I'm really here,

356
00:25:48.956 --> 00:25:51.666
and I'll still be here when
you've packed up and gone.


357
00:25:53.752 --> 00:25:55.378
But I'm not going.

358
00:25:55.462 --> 00:25:57.714
The house suits me perfectly.

359
00:25:57.798 --> 00:26:00.258
My dear woman,
it's not your house.


360
00:26:00.342 --> 00:26:01.968
It is as long as I pay rent.

361
00:26:02.052 --> 00:26:04.262
Pay rent to me blasted cousin!

362
00:26:04.346 --> 00:26:05.597
He's the legal owner.

363
00:26:05.681 --> 00:26:07.724
Legal owner be hanged!

364
00:26:07.808 --> 00:26:09.225
It's my house,

365
00:26:10.019 --> 00:26:12.770
and I want it turned into a home
for retired seamen.


366
00:26:12.855 --> 00:26:14.731
Then you should have
said so in your will.


367
00:26:14.815 --> 00:26:16.566
- I didn't leave a will.
- Why not?


368
00:26:16.650 --> 00:26:20.111
I didn't expect to kick
the blasted gas on with me foot!


369
00:26:20.196 --> 00:26:23.865
I won't be shouted at. Everyone shouts
at me and orders me about,


370
00:26:23.949 --> 00:26:25.158
and I'm sick of it,
do you hear?


371
00:26:25.242 --> 00:26:26.618
Blast! Blast! Blast!

372
00:26:26.702 --> 00:26:28.077
Temper.

373
00:26:28.162 --> 00:26:30.955
Or laughed at, either.
I won't leave this house.


374
00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:34.042
You can't make me leave it. I won't!

375
00:26:36.712 --> 00:26:38.755
Here, belay that.

376
00:26:39.506 --> 00:26:41.090
Stop it now,
do you hear me?


377
00:26:41.967 --> 00:26:45.303
If there's one thing I can't stand,
it's a woman crying.


378
00:26:45.387 --> 00:26:47.847
Stop it! Blast it all, madam.

379
00:26:47.932 --> 00:26:51.267
I love this house.
I thought I must stay here


380
00:26:51.352 --> 00:26:53.269
the moment I saw it.

381
00:26:53.354 --> 00:26:54.771
I can't explain it.

382
00:26:54.855 --> 00:26:57.273
It was as if the house itself
were welcoming me,


383
00:26:57.358 --> 00:27:00.944
asking me to rescue it
from being so empty.


384
00:27:01.862 --> 00:27:03.947
You can't understand that, can you?

385
00:27:04.031 --> 00:27:06.908
I suppose you think
I'm just a silly woman,


386
00:27:07.910 --> 00:27:10.245
but that's the way I feel.

387
00:27:11.789 --> 00:27:14.916
Well, there might be
some truth in it at that.


388
00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.210
I felt that way
about a ship once,


389
00:27:17.294 --> 00:27:19.295
my first command.

390
00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:21.547
Found her rusting
in the Mersey,


391
00:27:21.632 --> 00:27:24.550
gear all foul
and a pigsty below.


392
00:27:27.513 --> 00:27:30.223
Always swore she sailed
twice as sweetly for me


393
00:27:30.307 --> 00:27:32.225
as she would
for any other master


394
00:27:32.309 --> 00:27:34.269
out of gratitude.

395
00:27:35.771 --> 00:27:38.982
Well, you love the house.
That counts for you.


396
00:27:39.316 --> 00:27:41.317
And you've got spunk.
You didn't frighten like the others.


397
00:27:41.402 --> 00:27:43.319
That counts for you, too.

398
00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:45.905
You may stay,

399
00:27:46.115 --> 00:27:47.323
on trial.

400
00:27:47.408 --> 00:27:48.491
Oh, thank you.

401
00:27:48.575 --> 00:27:50.076
Keep your distance,
madam.


402
00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:52.662
I'm sorry.
You made me so happy.


403
00:27:52.746 --> 00:27:54.372
No intention
of making you happy.


404
00:27:54.456 --> 00:27:56.833
I merely want to do
what's best for the house.


405
00:27:56.917 --> 00:28:00.211
Then we're agreed,
and you'll go right away and leave us alone.


406
00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:04.799
I will not go right away.
Why should I?


407
00:28:05.592 --> 00:28:07.802
Because of Anna,
my little girl.


408
00:28:07.886 --> 00:28:09.804
I don't want her frightened into fits.

409
00:28:09.888 --> 00:28:11.806
I never frighten little girls into fits.

410
00:28:11.890 --> 00:28:14.809
Think of the bad language she'd learn
and the morals.


411
00:28:14.893 --> 00:28:17.812
Confound it, madam,
my language is most controlled,


412
00:28:17.896 --> 00:28:19.314
and as for me morals,

413
00:28:19.398 --> 00:28:22.317
I lived a man's life,
and I'm not ashamed of it.


414
00:28:22.401 --> 00:28:23.818
I can assure you

415
00:28:23.902 --> 00:28:26.321
no woman's ever been
the worse for knowing me,


416
00:28:26.405 --> 00:28:29.073
and I'd like to know how many
mealy-mouthed bluenoses


417
00:28:29.158 --> 00:28:30.325
can say the same.

418
00:28:30.409 --> 00:28:33.328
She's much too young
to see ghosts.


419
00:28:33.412 --> 00:28:35.830
Very well. I'll make a bargain with you.

420
00:28:36.707 --> 00:28:37.832
Leave me bedroom as it is,

421
00:28:37.916 --> 00:28:40.335
and I'll promise not to go
into any other room in the house.


422
00:28:40.419 --> 00:28:42.337
And your brat need never know
anything about me.


423
00:28:42.421 --> 00:28:45.089
But if you keep the best bedroom,
where should I sleep?


424
00:28:45.174 --> 00:28:47.091
In the best bedroom.

425
00:28:47.843 --> 00:28:48.843
But...

426
00:28:49.511 --> 00:28:51.596
In heaven's name, madam, why not?

427
00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:53.431
Why, bless my soul, I'm a spirit.

428
00:28:53.515 --> 00:28:55.933
I have no body.
I haven't had one for four years,


429
00:28:56.018 --> 00:28:57.185
is that clear?

430
00:28:57.269 --> 00:28:58.478
But I can see you.

431
00:28:58.562 --> 00:29:00.355
All you see is an illusion.

432
00:29:00.439 --> 00:29:02.607
It's like a blasted lantern slide.

433
00:29:02.691 --> 00:29:05.693
Well, it's not very convincing,

434
00:29:05.778 --> 00:29:07.487
but I suppose it's all right.

435
00:29:07.571 --> 00:29:10.573
Then it's settled.
I'm probably making a mistake.


436
00:29:10.657 --> 00:29:12.575
I always was a fool
for a helpless woman.


437
00:29:12.659 --> 00:29:14.077
I'm not helpless.

438
00:29:14.578 --> 00:29:16.120
If you're so confoundedly
competent,


439
00:29:16.205 --> 00:29:18.164
you'll notice your kettle's
about to boil over.


440
00:29:18.832 --> 00:29:20.541
So it is.

441
00:29:22.795 --> 00:29:25.046
One thing more.

442
00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:27.298
I want me painting hung in the bedroom,

443
00:29:27.383 --> 00:29:29.300
the one that's in the living room.

444
00:29:29.385 --> 00:29:32.136
Must I?
It's a very poor painting.


445
00:29:32.638 --> 00:29:34.972
It's my painting.
I didn't invite your criticism.


446
00:29:35.057 --> 00:29:37.308
I make that part of the bargain.

447
00:29:37.393 --> 00:29:41.104
I want you to put it there now, tonight.
Good night.


448
00:29:41.188 --> 00:29:42.563
Good night.

449
00:29:43.649 --> 00:29:46.317
I mean, it doesn't do you justice and...

450
00:30:03.377 --> 00:30:05.503
You might at least have
turned the light back on


451
00:30:05.587 --> 00:30:07.004
before you left.

452
00:30:48.464 --> 00:30:50.381
Such nonsense.

453
00:31:57.324 --> 00:31:59.951
<i>My dear,
never let anyone tell you</i>


454
00:32:00.035 --> 00:32:01.577
<i>to be ashamed of your figure!</i>

455
00:32:12.005 --> 00:32:14.924
There!
That's the last of them.


456
00:32:16.552 --> 00:32:18.594
Never held
with mourning meself.


457
00:32:18.679 --> 00:32:21.097
I always say life's
black enough as it is


458
00:32:21.181 --> 00:32:22.765
without dressing in it, too.

459
00:32:22.849 --> 00:32:24.267
Cheer up, Martha.

460
00:32:24.351 --> 00:32:25.768
Life isn't as bad as that.

461
00:32:25.852 --> 00:32:27.270
Who said it was?

462
00:32:32.859 --> 00:32:34.068
Good afternoon.

463
00:32:34.152 --> 00:32:36.696
What have you done
with me monkey puzzle tree?


464
00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:39.574
I expect it's chopped
for firewood by now.


465
00:32:39.658 --> 00:32:41.075
Hang it all, madam!

466
00:32:41.159 --> 00:32:43.578
I planted that tree
with me own two hands.


467
00:32:43.662 --> 00:32:44.996
Why?

468
00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:47.957
Because I wanted a monkey puzzle tree
in me garden!


469
00:32:48.041 --> 00:32:51.002
Think how much prettier
a bed of roses will look there.


470
00:32:51.086 --> 00:32:52.545
I hate roses!

471
00:32:53.046 --> 00:32:56.007
I hope the whole blasted bed
dies of blight!


472
00:32:56.091 --> 00:32:59.010
I wish you wouldn't swear.
It's so ugly.


473
00:32:59.094 --> 00:33:00.678
If you think that's ugly,

474
00:33:00.762 --> 00:33:03.556
it's a good thing
you can't read me thoughts.


475
00:33:04.933 --> 00:33:08.144
You seem to be
very earthly for a spirit.

476
00:33:08.228 --> 00:33:11.480
And you, madam, are enough
to make a saint take to blasphemy!


477
00:33:11.857 --> 00:33:13.566
Blasted women!

478
00:33:13.650 --> 00:33:16.152
Always make trouble
when you allow one aboard.


479
00:33:16.236 --> 00:33:18.321
Captain Gregg,
if you insist on haunting me,


480
00:33:18.405 --> 00:33:19.989
you might at least be
more agreeable about it.


481
00:33:20.073 --> 00:33:21.073
Why should I be agreeable?

482
00:33:21.158 --> 00:33:22.992
Well, as long as we're living...

483
00:33:23.285 --> 00:33:25.995
I mean, if we're to be
thrown together so much,


484
00:33:26.079 --> 00:33:28.331
life's too short to be forever
barking at each other.


485
00:33:28.457 --> 00:33:30.916
Your life may be short, madam.

486
00:33:31.001 --> 00:33:33.669
I have an unlimited time
at my disposal.


487
00:33:33.754 --> 00:33:35.671
There you go arguing again.

488
00:33:35.756 --> 00:33:39.008
Try to say something pleasant for a change.

489
00:33:43.263 --> 00:33:44.847
Uh, that's a...

490
00:33:45.057 --> 00:33:46.682
That's a pretty rig you have on.

491
00:33:46.767 --> 00:33:47.850
Thank you, sir.

492
00:33:47.934 --> 00:33:49.226
Much better than
smothering yourself


493
00:33:49.311 --> 00:33:50.895
in all that ugly black crepe.

494
00:33:50.979 --> 00:33:52.897
I happen to have been wearing
mourning for my husband.


495
00:33:52.981 --> 00:33:54.774
Whom you didn't love.

496
00:33:59.988 --> 00:34:01.530
How dare you say that!

497
00:34:01.615 --> 00:34:03.574
Because it's true.
You were fond of him perhaps,


498
00:34:03.659 --> 00:34:05.576
but you didn't love him.

499
00:34:06.370 --> 00:34:07.578
I suppose you're jealous

500
00:34:07.663 --> 00:34:09.955
because no one
put on mourning for you.


501
00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:12.208
That shows how little
you know about it.


502
00:34:12.292 --> 00:34:15.503
Some poor, misguided female no doubt.

503
00:34:15.837 --> 00:34:18.714
Three poor, misguided females to be exact.

504
00:34:18.799 --> 00:34:21.133
I should think
you'd be ashamed of it


505
00:34:21.218 --> 00:34:22.843
instead of boasting
about it.


506
00:34:22.928 --> 00:34:24.762
Why? They misguided themselves.

507
00:34:24.846 --> 00:34:26.347
I never raised a finger to help them.

508
00:34:26.431 --> 00:34:28.683
That's not what I've heard about sailors.

509
00:34:28.767 --> 00:34:30.935
Seamen, confound it!

510
00:34:31.019 --> 00:34:33.604
Sailor is a landlubber's word.

511
00:34:34.439 --> 00:34:36.190
Why did you marry him?

512
00:34:36.274 --> 00:34:37.358
Edwin?

513
00:34:39.403 --> 00:34:41.195
I don't really know.

514
00:34:42.948 --> 00:34:44.365
He was an architect.

515
00:34:44.449 --> 00:34:46.033
He came down to plan an addition

516
00:34:46.118 --> 00:34:48.536
to my father's library.

517
00:34:49.246 --> 00:34:51.372
I was only 17.

518
00:34:51.456 --> 00:34:53.874
I remember
I'd just finished a novel


519
00:34:53.959 --> 00:34:56.210
in which the heroine was
kissed in the rose garden


520
00:34:56.294 --> 00:34:58.713
and lived happily ever after.

521
00:34:58.797 --> 00:35:01.382
So when Edwin kissed me
in the orchard...


522
00:35:01.466 --> 00:35:02.883
But it was different

523
00:35:02.968 --> 00:35:05.052
after you left the orchard.

524
00:35:06.722 --> 00:35:08.305
He didn't beat you, did he?

525
00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:09.932
Oh, no!

526
00:35:10.892 --> 00:35:14.019
Poor Edwin.
He never did anything.


527
00:35:14.730 --> 00:35:18.023
I'm afraid he wasn't even
a very good architect.


528
00:35:18.900 --> 00:35:21.694
He couldn't have designed
a house like this.


529
00:35:22.612 --> 00:35:23.904
Who did?

530
00:35:24.114 --> 00:35:25.573
I did.

531
00:35:27.325 --> 00:35:29.201
It reminds me of something...

532
00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:32.955
An old song, or a poem.

533
00:35:33.081 --> 00:35:35.332
"Magic casements,
opening on the foam


534
00:35:35.417 --> 00:35:38.169
"of perilous seas,
in faery lands forlorn."


535
00:35:38.253 --> 00:35:39.670
That's Keats, isn't it?

536
00:35:39.755 --> 00:35:41.172
<i>The Nightingale.</i>

537
00:35:41.256 --> 00:35:45.217
Strange to find a sea captain
quoting Keats.


538
00:35:45.761 --> 00:35:48.220
Oh, life's slow at sea.

539
00:35:49.598 --> 00:35:52.224
Plenty of time for reading
in the off watches.


540
00:35:53.393 --> 00:35:54.935
How romantic.

541
00:35:55.771 --> 00:35:58.856
Reading lyric poetry
up in the crow's-nest


542
00:35:58.940 --> 00:36:00.858
with the sheets bellying in the wind.

543
00:36:00.942 --> 00:36:03.027
Sails, blast it all, madam!

544
00:36:03.111 --> 00:36:05.613
A sheet's a line, a rope.

545
00:36:05.822 --> 00:36:07.865
Ropes can't belly.

546
00:36:08.617 --> 00:36:11.160
I don't know anything
about the sea


547
00:36:11.244 --> 00:36:12.912
except that it is romantic.

548
00:36:12.996 --> 00:36:14.872
That's what
all landsmen think.


549
00:36:14.956 --> 00:36:16.540
Seamen know better.

550
00:36:16.625 --> 00:36:18.167
Then why do they
go to sea?


551
00:36:18.251 --> 00:36:21.045
Because they haven't
the sense to stay ashore.


552
00:36:21.129 --> 00:36:23.172
Heaven help
the ordinary seaman.


553
00:36:23.256 --> 00:36:25.090
Were you ever one?

554
00:36:25.175 --> 00:36:27.802
For several years,
while I learnt me trade.


555
00:36:28.804 --> 00:36:32.598
It's hard to imagine you
being an ordinary anything.


556
00:36:42.651 --> 00:36:44.360
You got callers.

557
00:36:46.947 --> 00:36:49.365
Oh, dear!
Whatever can they want?


558
00:36:49.449 --> 00:36:50.616
Who is it?

559
00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:52.993
My blasted in-laws!

560
00:36:56.081 --> 00:36:57.540
But she's resting, ma'am.

561
00:36:57.666 --> 00:36:59.041
Then we'll go up.

562
00:37:00.043 --> 00:37:03.045
Quick! Hide or go away or decompose.

563
00:37:03.129 --> 00:37:04.713
Dematerialize, madam.

564
00:37:04.798 --> 00:37:06.048
Whatever it is,
do it quickly.


565
00:37:06.132 --> 00:37:08.801
No fear.
They can't see me or hear me


566
00:37:08.885 --> 00:37:10.636
unless I choose
that they should.


567
00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:12.805
Oh, then please don't choose.
I'll get rid of them.


568
00:37:12.889 --> 00:37:15.099
Why don't you let me?
I've had plenty of practice.


569
00:37:15.183 --> 00:37:17.434
Say the word,
and I'll keelhaul them.


570
00:37:17.519 --> 00:37:19.311
No. You're not to do anything!

571
00:37:19.396 --> 00:37:20.813
Well, Lucy.

572
00:37:20.897 --> 00:37:22.690
Talking to herself.

573
00:37:23.233 --> 00:37:26.026
Oh, my poor Lucy.

574
00:37:27.070 --> 00:37:28.445
You look so pale.

575
00:37:28.530 --> 00:37:30.781
- Well! What an ugly room!
- It isn't really.


576
00:37:30.866 --> 00:37:32.449
Whatever do you want
with that telescope?


577
00:37:32.534 --> 00:37:34.159
I like to look at the stars.

578
00:37:34.244 --> 00:37:35.452
You never liked
to look at the stars


579
00:37:35.537 --> 00:37:36.662
when you lived with us.

580
00:37:36.746 --> 00:37:38.372
Sit down, Mother.

581
00:37:39.958 --> 00:37:41.876
And what a hideous painting.

582
00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:43.669
Anyone with a face
like yours, madam,


583
00:37:43.753 --> 00:37:45.838
should steer clear of
expressing such opinions.


584
00:37:45.922 --> 00:37:47.464
Why on earth don't you
take it down?


585
00:37:48.425 --> 00:37:50.217
Because I like it, Eva.

586
00:37:50.302 --> 00:37:52.136
I'm very fond of it,
really I am.


587
00:37:53.305 --> 00:37:55.097
Liar.

588
00:37:55.181 --> 00:37:57.182
Of course.
If you want a portrait


589
00:37:57.267 --> 00:37:59.310
of a strange man
in your room,


590
00:37:59.394 --> 00:38:01.228
well, that's up to you.

591
00:38:01.313 --> 00:38:04.857
I'm sure you didn't come here
merely to criticize the decorations.


592
00:38:04.941 --> 00:38:06.317
No, we did not.

593
00:38:06.401 --> 00:38:08.944
Oh, poor Lucy,
we've such bad news for you.


594
00:38:09.029 --> 00:38:11.322
I suppose it's all for the best,
everything considered.


595
00:38:11.406 --> 00:38:12.489
Don't you, Eva?

596
00:38:12.574 --> 00:38:14.325
And in my opinion,
we're just in time.


597
00:38:14.409 --> 00:38:17.328
So perhaps our bad news
is good news after all,


598
00:38:17.412 --> 00:38:19.830
and now we can all
go home and live together


599
00:38:19.915 --> 00:38:23.334
and forget all this nonsense
about living alone.


600
00:38:23.418 --> 00:38:24.543
What news is this?

601
00:38:24.961 --> 00:38:26.045
Your gold mine, Lucy.

602
00:38:26.129 --> 00:38:27.338
It's petered out.

603
00:38:27.422 --> 00:38:28.839
They've stopped
paying dividends.


604
00:38:28.924 --> 00:38:30.549
It was in <i>The Times</i>
this morning.


605
00:38:39.267 --> 00:38:40.851
Avast now.

606
00:38:40.936 --> 00:38:42.853
Don't make a scene
in front of these swabs.


607
00:38:42.938 --> 00:38:44.521
I don't intend
to make a scene.


608
00:38:44.606 --> 00:38:47.858
Of course you don't.

609
00:38:47.943 --> 00:38:51.362
You're my brave little girl,
that's what you are.


610
00:38:51.446 --> 00:38:55.199
- Oh, Lucy. My little Lucy.
- Please.


611
00:38:55.283 --> 00:38:57.034
Make her stop that
eternal caterwauling


612
00:38:57.118 --> 00:38:58.202
or I will take a hand!

613
00:38:58.286 --> 00:39:00.245
- You keep out of this!
- Oh, Lucy!


614
00:39:01.623 --> 00:39:03.040
Oh, blast!

615
00:39:03.124 --> 00:39:05.125
Oh! Did you hear her, Eva?

616
00:39:05.210 --> 00:39:07.169
Yes, I heard her.
Stop sniveling, Mother.


617
00:39:07.253 --> 00:39:09.129
If that's what you want,
we will keep out of it.


618
00:39:09.214 --> 00:39:10.255
I didn't mean you.

619
00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:11.674
Then just whom
did you mean?


620
00:39:11.758 --> 00:39:13.842
Well, I could explain, I suppose,

621
00:39:13.927 --> 00:39:15.844
but you wouldn't believe me.

622
00:39:15.929 --> 00:39:17.346
All I know is
that you're acting


623
00:39:17.430 --> 00:39:18.847
in a most peculiar fashion.

624
00:39:18.932 --> 00:39:20.349
The only charitable explanation

625
00:39:20.433 --> 00:39:22.351
is that the solitude
has preyed on your mind.


626
00:39:22.435 --> 00:39:24.144
She thinks you've got bats in your belfry.

627
00:39:24.229 --> 00:39:25.354
Oh, pipe down!

628
00:39:25.438 --> 00:39:27.856
I mean, I want to think.

629
00:39:28.316 --> 00:39:30.901
Very well, I will pipe down,
as you put it,


630
00:39:30.986 --> 00:39:32.361
but it should be
perfectly obvious


631
00:39:32.445 --> 00:39:33.529
that with your income gone

632
00:39:33.613 --> 00:39:35.197
there's only one course
for you to follow,


633
00:39:35.281 --> 00:39:36.949
and that is to come
home now, with us.


634
00:39:37.033 --> 00:39:39.284
You mean give up this house?

635
00:39:39.369 --> 00:39:42.287
Naturally. It was idiotic
to take it in the first place,


636
00:39:42.372 --> 00:39:45.666
and now that you're a pauper,
how can you possibly stay?


637
00:39:50.338 --> 00:39:52.297
Don't do it, Lucy.

638
00:39:53.925 --> 00:39:55.759
Do you want me to stay?

639
00:39:55.844 --> 00:39:56.802
Yes.

640
00:39:56.886 --> 00:39:58.303
Do you really mean it?

641
00:39:58.388 --> 00:39:59.763
Of course I mean it.

642
00:39:59.848 --> 00:40:01.932
Tell them to shove off.

643
00:40:02.017 --> 00:40:04.184
We'll think of something.

644
00:40:05.729 --> 00:40:08.480
I'm sorry.
It's very kind of you to want me back,


645
00:40:08.565 --> 00:40:10.941
but I'm going to stay.
I'll manage somehow.


646
00:40:11.026 --> 00:40:14.194
So, please be good enough
to shove off.


647
00:40:15.113 --> 00:40:17.614
Very well. You're obviously insane,

648
00:40:17.699 --> 00:40:19.950
and I for one want nothing more
to do with you.


649
00:40:20.035 --> 00:40:21.493
Come, Mother.

650
00:40:29.878 --> 00:40:31.295
Captain Gregg...

651
00:40:31.379 --> 00:40:33.380
Captain Gregg, where are you?

652
00:40:37.969 --> 00:40:39.762
Don't forget your promise.

653
00:40:42.474 --> 00:40:44.349
It's too ridiculous!

654
00:40:44.809 --> 00:40:47.227
I'm going to give her
one more chance.


655
00:40:48.313 --> 00:40:49.730
Stop pulling me, Mother.

656
00:40:49.814 --> 00:40:51.565
I'm not pulling you, Eva.

657
00:40:53.318 --> 00:40:54.401
Stop it, I say!

658
00:40:54.486 --> 00:40:56.403
I'm not touching you, Eva.

659
00:40:56.488 --> 00:40:58.572
- Off we go!
- Let me go!


660
00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:23.472
Mummy's coming aboard
in a motorcar.


661
00:41:23.598 --> 00:41:25.849
Mr. Coombe is invited for tea.

662
00:41:28.478 --> 00:41:31.355
I'm so glad you found
the house suitable after all.


663
00:41:31.439 --> 00:41:33.857
I'm convinced now that
we were unduly concerned


664
00:41:33.942 --> 00:41:36.360
about the possibility
of a ghost haunting it.


665
00:41:36.444 --> 00:41:38.362
As you say, how could
such things exist


666
00:41:38.446 --> 00:41:39.696
in the 20th century?

667
00:41:39.781 --> 00:41:42.116
Indeed. How could they?

668
00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:45.744
Still, you must admit
it's a very isolated location,


669
00:41:45.829 --> 00:41:48.372
and I've often thought of you
out here alone


670
00:41:48.456 --> 00:41:52.376
without the protection of a man,
the right man, could offer you.


671
00:42:30.123 --> 00:42:32.207
I only hope when
I reach the afterlife


672
00:42:32.292 --> 00:42:33.876
I have a little more dignity.

673
00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:35.043
Dignity?

674
00:42:35.128 --> 00:42:36.712
Do you call it dignified
to throw yourself


675
00:42:36.796 --> 00:42:38.922
at a herring-gutted swab
like that?


676
00:42:39.007 --> 00:42:41.717
I asked Mr. Coombe here
because he's the logical man


677
00:42:41.801 --> 00:42:44.219
to help me find lodgers
for the summer.


678
00:42:44.304 --> 00:42:45.470
Lodgers?

679
00:42:48.433 --> 00:42:50.225
Here, weigh your anchor.

680
00:42:50.310 --> 00:42:52.895
Forgive me, my dear.
I've been seriously misled.


681
00:42:52.979 --> 00:42:55.397
I thought you wanted
to sign him on for a husband.


682
00:42:55.481 --> 00:42:57.900
Mr. Coombe?
That walrus!


683
00:42:57.984 --> 00:43:00.903
It's my experience that women
will do anything for money.


684
00:43:00.987 --> 00:43:04.489
Now you and your blasted
experiences have ruined everything.


685
00:43:04.574 --> 00:43:06.742
No. No. No.
There's no harm done.


686
00:43:06.826 --> 00:43:09.244
I couldn't allow you to
take in lodgers in any case.


687
00:43:09.329 --> 00:43:10.829
They're worse
than passengers at sea.


688
00:43:10.914 --> 00:43:12.539
It's them or starve.

689
00:43:13.082 --> 00:43:14.958
Not at all, my dear.

690
00:43:15.043 --> 00:43:17.461
I've solved all your problems.

691
00:43:17.545 --> 00:43:19.254
You're going to write a book.

692
00:43:21.299 --> 00:43:23.300
A book?

693
00:43:23.384 --> 00:43:25.385
But I couldn't.

694
00:43:26.346 --> 00:43:28.722
I find it hard enough
to write a postcard.


695
00:43:28.806 --> 00:43:30.474
No, but I can.

696
00:43:30.558 --> 00:43:32.726
I can write a book,

697
00:43:32.810 --> 00:43:34.811
and you can put it
down on paper for me.


698
00:43:34.896 --> 00:43:36.313
What will the book be about?

699
00:43:36.397 --> 00:43:38.482
Me. The story of me life.

700
00:43:38.566 --> 00:43:41.818
And we'll call it, uh, let's see.

701
00:43:41.903 --> 00:43:43.654
We'll call it, uh,

702
00:43:44.113 --> 00:43:45.781
<i>Blood and Swash.</i>

703
00:43:46.950 --> 00:43:49.868
Yes. <i>Blood and Swash</i> by Captain X.

704
00:43:49.953 --> 00:43:52.162
I don't think that's
at all a nice title.


705
00:43:52.247 --> 00:43:53.664
It's not meant to be.

706
00:43:53.748 --> 00:43:56.667
It's meant to be sensational,
like the subject.


707
00:43:56.751 --> 00:43:59.294
But it takes months
to write a book.


708
00:43:59.379 --> 00:44:01.255
What are we to live on
in the meantime?


709
00:44:01.339 --> 00:44:03.215
- You have jewelry?
- A little.


710
00:44:03.299 --> 00:44:04.508
Pawn it.

711
00:44:04.592 --> 00:44:06.009
But I couldn't!

712
00:44:06.094 --> 00:44:08.387
Blast your eyes, madam.
Will you understand?


713
00:44:08.471 --> 00:44:10.389
You're trying to
crawl off a lee shore.


714
00:44:10.473 --> 00:44:11.598
Can't afford to be squeamish.

715
00:44:11.683 --> 00:44:13.892
I do understand,
and don't swear at me.


716
00:44:13.977 --> 00:44:16.395
Start with that
ugly broach.


717
00:44:16.479 --> 00:44:18.397
But Edwin's mother
gave it to me.


718
00:44:18.481 --> 00:44:19.898
All the more reason
to pawn it.


719
00:44:19.983 --> 00:44:23.610
You don't like Edwin's mother,
and you hate her broach.


720
00:44:24.779 --> 00:44:26.488
Really, Captain Gregg.
I'll have you know


721
00:44:26.572 --> 00:44:28.240
I'm very fond
of my mother-in-law.


722
00:44:28.950 --> 00:44:30.826
Very well. If you're
so fond of her,


723
00:44:30.910 --> 00:44:32.327
you can go back
and live with her.


724
00:44:41.129 --> 00:44:43.547
I think I can get
about £10 for it.


725
00:44:43.631 --> 00:44:47.009
Ah. I'm glad you're going to be sensible,

726
00:44:47.093 --> 00:44:49.011
and since we're
to be collaborators,


727
00:44:49.095 --> 00:44:51.054
you can call me Daniel.

728
00:44:52.056 --> 00:44:53.432
That's very good of you.

729
00:44:53.516 --> 00:44:56.310
And I shall call you Lucia.

730
00:44:57.020 --> 00:44:58.478
My name is Lucy.

731
00:44:58.563 --> 00:45:01.023
It doesn't do you justice,
my dear.


732
00:45:01.107 --> 00:45:03.525
Women named Lucy are always
being imposed upon,


733
00:45:03.609 --> 00:45:06.862
but Lucia, now there's
a name for an amazon,


734
00:45:06.946 --> 00:45:08.447
for a queen.

735
00:45:08.531 --> 00:45:10.949
I don't feel much
like a queen.


736
00:45:11.034 --> 00:45:13.744
I feel frightened
and confused


737
00:45:13.828 --> 00:45:15.954
and wondering what
the future will bring.


738
00:45:16.039 --> 00:45:17.456
Don't you trust me?

739
00:45:17.540 --> 00:45:20.459
Oh, I do, Daniel,
when I'm talking to you.


740
00:45:20.543 --> 00:45:22.961
When you're not here, I...

741
00:45:23.046 --> 00:45:25.797
Well, it's asking a great deal
to expect anyone


742
00:45:25.882 --> 00:45:28.967
to trust her whole
future to a...


743
00:45:29.052 --> 00:45:30.635
To someone who isn't real.

744
00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:31.970
But I am real.

745
00:45:32.055 --> 00:45:34.681
I'm here because
you believe I'm here.


746
00:45:36.392 --> 00:45:38.477
And keep on believing,

747
00:45:38.561 --> 00:45:40.687
and I'll always
be real to you.


748
00:45:41.522 --> 00:45:43.065
Yes, Daniel.

749
00:46:14.847 --> 00:46:16.765
Well, what's the matter?

750
00:46:20.353 --> 00:46:21.770
You haven't finished
the sentence.


751
00:46:21.854 --> 00:46:23.647
I know. It's...

752
00:46:23.731 --> 00:46:25.774
It's that word.

753
00:46:25.858 --> 00:46:27.776
I've never written
such a word.


754
00:46:27.860 --> 00:46:29.277
It's a perfectly good word.

755
00:46:29.362 --> 00:46:31.279
I think it's a horrid word.

756
00:46:31.364 --> 00:46:33.281
It means what it says,
doesn't it?


757
00:46:33.366 --> 00:46:34.783
All too clearly.

758
00:46:34.867 --> 00:46:36.284
What word do you use

759
00:46:36.369 --> 00:46:37.786
if you wanted to
convey that meaning?


760
00:46:37.870 --> 00:46:38.954
I don't use any!

761
00:46:39.038 --> 00:46:40.080
Well, hang it all, Lucia.

762
00:46:40.164 --> 00:46:42.290
If you're going to be prudish,
we'll never get the book written.


763
00:46:42.375 --> 00:46:44.751
Now, put it down
the way I give it to you.


764
00:46:50.967 --> 00:46:52.801
Good.

765
00:46:52.885 --> 00:46:55.804
Now, at this point,
having had a drink,


766
00:46:55.888 --> 00:46:58.306
I went upstairs.

767
00:46:58.391 --> 00:46:59.641
Why?

768
00:46:59.725 --> 00:47:00.809
Why what?

769
00:47:00.893 --> 00:47:02.811
Why did you go upstairs?

770
00:47:02.895 --> 00:47:04.813
Because I saw no harm in it.

771
00:47:04.897 --> 00:47:07.149
You must have been
very young and foolish.


772
00:47:07.233 --> 00:47:08.733
I was young,
but I was never foolish.


773
00:47:08.818 --> 00:47:10.527
Inexperienced, perhaps,

774
00:47:10.611 --> 00:47:14.239
curious, as young men are,
eager for adventure.


775
00:47:14.323 --> 00:47:16.241
I matured early.

776
00:47:16.325 --> 00:47:18.243
I wish I'd known you then.

777
00:47:18.327 --> 00:47:19.744
How old were you, Daniel?

778
00:47:19.829 --> 00:47:22.247
16. It was me first voyage.

779
00:47:22.331 --> 00:47:23.790
Only 16.

780
00:47:24.625 --> 00:47:26.251
I suppose you'd
run away from home.


781
00:47:26.335 --> 00:47:28.253
Yes. I was an orphan.

782
00:47:28.337 --> 00:47:32.466
Brought up by a maiden aunt
in a country village.


783
00:47:32.550 --> 00:47:34.759
Now, let's get on with it.
Where was I?


784
00:47:34.844 --> 00:47:36.011
Upstairs.

785
00:47:36.095 --> 00:47:37.721
Ah, yes!

786
00:47:37.805 --> 00:47:41.057
The customs of Marseilles
are different to any...


787
00:47:41.142 --> 00:47:42.559
Different from.

788
00:47:42.643 --> 00:47:44.561
To or from, who cares?

789
00:47:44.645 --> 00:47:46.813
This isn't a blasted
literary epic.


790
00:47:46.898 --> 00:47:49.232
It's the unvarnished story
of a seaman's life.


791
00:47:49.317 --> 00:47:51.735
It certainly is unvarnished.

792
00:47:51.819 --> 00:47:53.987
Well, smear on
your own varnish.


793
00:47:54.071 --> 00:47:55.489
Change the grammar
all you please,


794
00:47:55.573 --> 00:47:57.491
but leave the guts in it.

795
00:48:00.411 --> 00:48:01.495
I think it would be nice

796
00:48:01.579 --> 00:48:04.164
if we included a chapter
about your early life,


797
00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:06.750
your school days.

798
00:48:06.834 --> 00:48:10.045
I never went to school.
I was educated by the vicar.


799
00:48:10.129 --> 00:48:12.714
Poor man.
He must have had a dreadful time.


800
00:48:12.798 --> 00:48:15.217
He enjoyed every minute of it,

801
00:48:15.927 --> 00:48:18.929
except for the time
I put a snake in this bed.


802
00:48:19.013 --> 00:48:21.139
You must have been
a horrid little boy.


803
00:48:21.224 --> 00:48:22.933
I suppose you were
a model of all the virtues


804
00:48:23.017 --> 00:48:25.143
- when you were 12.
- Certainly I was.


805
00:48:25.228 --> 00:48:27.437
I won a prize
for deportment at school.


806
00:48:27.522 --> 00:48:29.439
Hmm, I can see you.

807
00:48:29.524 --> 00:48:31.274
Fat little girl
in hair ribbons.


808
00:48:31.359 --> 00:48:33.568
- I wasn't fat. I was skinny.
- Just as bad.


809
00:48:33.653 --> 00:48:34.945
And I wore my hair in braids.

810
00:48:35.029 --> 00:48:36.446
And a thousand freckles.

811
00:48:38.449 --> 00:48:40.951
You still have freckles.

812
00:48:41.035 --> 00:48:42.953
Only seven of them,

813
00:48:43.037 --> 00:48:45.664
and I'm told
they're most becoming.


814
00:48:47.041 --> 00:48:49.501
They are at that.

815
00:48:52.338 --> 00:48:54.714
Good heavens! 11:00.

816
00:48:56.384 --> 00:48:58.969
I had no idea
it was so late.


817
00:48:59.053 --> 00:49:01.972
Yes. You had better be getting some sleep.

818
00:49:02.056 --> 00:49:03.765
We'll put in
a full day tomorrow.


819
00:49:06.060 --> 00:49:10.438
Daniel, what did your aunt do
when you ran away to sea?


820
00:49:10.523 --> 00:49:12.774
Oh, probably thanked heaven
there was no one around


821
00:49:12.858 --> 00:49:15.068
to fill her house
with mongrel puppies


822
00:49:15.152 --> 00:49:17.112
and track mud
on her carpets.


823
00:49:17.196 --> 00:49:18.989
Did she write to you?

824
00:49:19.073 --> 00:49:21.449
Every Sunday for seven years.

825
00:49:21.534 --> 00:49:24.452
I was at sea
when she died.


826
00:49:24.537 --> 00:49:26.413
It was the year
I got me mate's ticket.


827
00:49:33.546 --> 00:49:35.839
What are you
thinking about, Lucia?


828
00:49:35.923 --> 00:49:39.092
I'm thinking how lonely
she must have felt


829
00:49:39.176 --> 00:49:41.761
with her clean carpets.

830
00:50:21.510 --> 00:50:23.011
Seen that Coombe
in the village.


831
00:50:23.095 --> 00:50:24.387
He give me this for you.

832
00:50:24.472 --> 00:50:26.222
Thanks, Martha.

833
00:50:26.307 --> 00:50:28.558
It's another demand
for payment of the rent.


834
00:50:28.643 --> 00:50:30.560
He did say something
about sending the bailiffs


835
00:50:30.645 --> 00:50:32.062
to put us out.

836
00:50:32.980 --> 00:50:34.898
I've got a little money
put by, ma'am.


837
00:50:34.982 --> 00:50:36.941
There ain't been nothing
to spend it on here.


838
00:50:37.026 --> 00:50:38.485
Thank you, Martha,

839
00:50:38.569 --> 00:50:40.487
but I wouldn't dream
of taking it.


840
00:50:40.571 --> 00:50:42.489
We'll manage somehow.

841
00:50:42.990 --> 00:50:44.449
Yes, ma'am.

842
00:50:51.707 --> 00:50:53.917
It's unimportant.
Don't worry about it.


843
00:50:54.001 --> 00:50:55.418
What if he sends the bailiffs?

844
00:50:55.503 --> 00:50:56.920
I'll handle them.

845
00:50:57.004 --> 00:51:00.382
Bailiffs are nothing
but sea lawyers come ashore.


846
00:51:00.466 --> 00:51:02.384
I'm so tired, Daniel.

847
00:51:02.468 --> 00:51:04.886
I can't see straight
or think straight.


848
00:51:04.970 --> 00:51:06.388
Now then,

849
00:51:06.472 --> 00:51:08.932
there's only one more
chapter to do.


850
00:51:09.016 --> 00:51:10.975
Better be at it.

851
00:51:13.479 --> 00:51:14.646
Lucia!

852
00:51:16.482 --> 00:51:18.400
I'm ready, Daniel.

853
00:51:18.484 --> 00:51:19.901
Good, my dear.

854
00:51:24.115 --> 00:51:25.115
To all who follow

855
00:51:25.199 --> 00:51:28.410
the hard and honorable
profession of the sea,


856
00:51:28.494 --> 00:51:31.413
to the after-guard
and forecastle alike,


857
00:51:31.497 --> 00:51:35.417
to masters, mates,
and engineers,


858
00:51:35.501 --> 00:51:38.420
to able-bodied
and ordinary seamen,


859
00:51:38.504 --> 00:51:41.923
to stokers, apprentices,
ship's boys,


860
00:51:42.007 --> 00:51:44.926
carpenters, sailmakers,
and sea cooks,


861
00:51:45.970 --> 00:51:47.887
I dedicate this volume.

862
00:51:49.849 --> 00:51:50.932
The end.

863
00:51:51.016 --> 00:51:52.434
The end.

864
00:51:52.518 --> 00:51:55.437
Now, tomorrow
you'll take it to the publishers.


865
00:51:55.521 --> 00:51:57.647
I hope they like it.

866
00:51:57.732 --> 00:51:59.065
They must like it.

867
00:51:59.150 --> 00:52:00.859
They will.

868
00:52:00.943 --> 00:52:02.861
It's strange. I...

869
00:52:02.945 --> 00:52:05.864
I didn't think so at first.

870
00:52:05.948 --> 00:52:08.867
Somehow it's a very wise book.

871
00:52:08.951 --> 00:52:12.203
It has elements of wisdom
in it, my dear.


872
00:52:12.288 --> 00:52:13.830
I didn't lead
a very wise life myself,


873
00:52:13.914 --> 00:52:17.500
but it was a full one
and a grown-up one.


874
00:52:19.795 --> 00:52:23.631
You come of age very quickly
through shipwreck and disaster.


875
00:52:24.633 --> 00:52:27.260
I never understood
the sea before,


876
00:52:27.344 --> 00:52:29.429
or the men who go to sea.

877
00:52:30.890 --> 00:52:32.807
Why did you write
the book, Daniel?


878
00:52:32.892 --> 00:52:35.143
It wasn't merely to
save the house for me.


879
00:52:35.227 --> 00:52:36.311
Partly that.

880
00:52:36.395 --> 00:52:40.815
For you and the retired seamen
you'll leave it to in your will,


881
00:52:40.900 --> 00:52:43.818
but mostly to help
people understand,


882
00:52:43.903 --> 00:52:45.862
to make them understand.

883
00:52:45.946 --> 00:52:48.406
All those
comfortable swabs


884
00:52:48.491 --> 00:52:50.909
who sit at home
in their beam-ends


885
00:52:50.993 --> 00:52:52.160
reveling in the luxuries

886
00:52:52.244 --> 00:52:55.413
that seamen risk their lives
to bring to them,


887
00:52:55.498 --> 00:52:56.623
and despising
the poor devils


888
00:52:56.707 --> 00:52:58.958
if they so much as touch
a drop of rum,


889
00:53:00.294 --> 00:53:04.214
and even sneering at people
who try to do them some good


890
00:53:04.298 --> 00:53:06.299
like you and me.

891
00:53:11.138 --> 00:53:13.181
Well, uh,

892
00:53:13.265 --> 00:53:15.683
tomorrow, the publishers.

893
00:53:15.768 --> 00:53:18.186
Tacket and Sproule
in Great Smith Street.


894
00:53:18.270 --> 00:53:20.188
Now be sure you see Sproule.

895
00:53:20.272 --> 00:53:22.524
He owned a small
sailing yacht.


896
00:53:22.608 --> 00:53:24.692
He came in fourth
in a club regatta once


897
00:53:24.777 --> 00:53:28.071
and fancies himself as the very devil
of a seafaring man.


898
00:53:29.949 --> 00:53:33.701
To tell you the truth, he doesn't know
a crossjack from a scuttlebutt.


899
00:53:33.786 --> 00:53:35.203
Yes, Daniel.

900
00:53:48.467 --> 00:53:50.218
Ship out there.

901
00:53:50.302 --> 00:53:52.220
Too close, by the sound.

902
00:53:52.304 --> 00:53:54.556
It's the loneliest sound,

903
00:53:54.640 --> 00:53:57.725
like a child lost
and crying in the dark.


904
00:53:57.810 --> 00:53:59.811
Hmm, he's lost, all right,

905
00:53:59.895 --> 00:54:02.146
with a captain cursing a blue streak

906
00:54:02.231 --> 00:54:03.648
and wondering why
he ever went to sea


907
00:54:03.732 --> 00:54:05.483
instead of opening
a grocer's shop


908
00:54:05.568 --> 00:54:07.360
like a sensible man.

909
00:54:08.737 --> 00:54:11.489
Fog in the channel
is treacherous.


910
00:54:11.574 --> 00:54:13.491
I'd rather face
a northeaster.


911
00:54:13.576 --> 00:54:16.160
Still, it's honest, the sea.

912
00:54:16.245 --> 00:54:19.205
It makes you face things honestly,
doesn't it?


913
00:54:20.583 --> 00:54:23.167
There's something on your mind.

914
00:54:23.252 --> 00:54:24.294
Yes.

915
00:54:25.754 --> 00:54:28.172
What's to become of us, Daniel?

916
00:54:28.257 --> 00:54:29.674
Of you and me?

917
00:54:29.758 --> 00:54:32.176
Nothing can become of me.

918
00:54:32.261 --> 00:54:35.680
Everything's happened
that can happen.


919
00:54:35.764 --> 00:54:37.724
But not to me.

920
00:54:38.601 --> 00:54:40.184
When we were
writing the book,


921
00:54:40.269 --> 00:54:41.686
I was happy.

922
00:54:41.770 --> 00:54:43.730
We were accomplishing
something together.


923
00:54:45.107 --> 00:54:48.067
Now, when I try to
think about the future,


924
00:54:48.152 --> 00:54:51.195
it's all dark and confused,

925
00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:54.741
like trying to see into the fog.

926
00:54:56.785 --> 00:54:59.913
You've been working too hard,
cooped up in the house too long.


927
00:54:59.997 --> 00:55:01.664
You need a change of scene.

928
00:55:01.749 --> 00:55:02.957
But I love it here.

929
00:55:03.042 --> 00:55:04.626
You should be out
in the world more,


930
00:55:04.710 --> 00:55:06.127
meeting people.

931
00:55:08.589 --> 00:55:09.923
Seeing men.

932
00:55:10.007 --> 00:55:12.008
I have no desire
to see men.


933
00:55:12.092 --> 00:55:14.052
You should, Lucia.

934
00:55:14.136 --> 00:55:17.847
You're a confoundedly
attractive woman,


935
00:55:17.932 --> 00:55:20.183
or hadn't you noticed?

936
00:55:20.267 --> 00:55:23.478
Really, my dear,
you owe it to yourself.


937
00:55:25.773 --> 00:55:27.190
Yes, Daniel.

938
00:55:30.778 --> 00:55:31.861
Good night.

939
00:55:31.946 --> 00:55:33.196
Good night.

940
00:55:35.783 --> 00:55:37.367
My dear.

941
00:55:56.804 --> 00:55:59.973
Oh, Daniel, I'm afraid
we've got ourselves


942
00:56:00.057 --> 00:56:02.141
into an awful fix.

943
00:56:45.436 --> 00:56:47.687
I should like to see
Mr. Sproule, please.


944
00:56:47.771 --> 00:56:49.272
I see you're back,
Mr. Fairley.


945
00:56:49.356 --> 00:56:50.440
Obviously.

946
00:56:50.524 --> 00:56:52.191
Have you decided to wait?

947
00:56:52.276 --> 00:56:54.193
Forever if I must.

948
00:56:54.278 --> 00:56:57.030
I should like to see
Mr. Sproule, please.


949
00:56:57.114 --> 00:56:59.198
Can't see Mr. Sproule
without an appointment.


950
00:56:59.283 --> 00:57:01.117
But I have a manuscript.

951
00:57:01.201 --> 00:57:03.911
So you have a manuscript.
Most unusual.


952
00:57:03.996 --> 00:57:06.539
No more so than your adenoids
and your bad manners.


953
00:57:06.623 --> 00:57:08.791
Now, take the lady's name.

954
00:57:08.876 --> 00:57:10.001
Leave your name.

955
00:57:10.085 --> 00:57:11.627
Mrs. Edwin Muir.

956
00:57:11.712 --> 00:57:13.129
Mrs...

957
00:57:13.213 --> 00:57:16.799
Mrs. Edwin Muir.

958
00:57:16.884 --> 00:57:20.136
Gull Cottage,
Whitecliff-by-the-sea.


959
00:57:20.220 --> 00:57:23.139
Can't I have just a few moments
with Mr. Sproule now?


960
00:57:23.223 --> 00:57:25.183
I've come all the way in
from Whitecliff.


961
00:57:26.560 --> 00:57:27.769
All for now.

962
00:57:39.740 --> 00:57:41.991
Is it a cookbook?

963
00:57:42.076 --> 00:57:45.328
I hope not another "life of Byron".

964
00:57:45.412 --> 00:57:47.413
Or is it
a book of dreams?


965
00:57:50.250 --> 00:57:51.667
You're trying
to give me a hint.


966
00:57:51.752 --> 00:57:53.211
Has it something
to do with ice?


967
00:57:57.091 --> 00:57:59.634
Is it really very important
for you to see old Sproule?


968
00:57:59.718 --> 00:58:01.135
Yes, so important.

969
00:58:01.220 --> 00:58:02.637
Then see him you shall,

970
00:58:02.721 --> 00:58:05.681
and it is your good fortune
that I'm not only irresponsible,


971
00:58:05.766 --> 00:58:07.183
but also unreasonable.

972
00:58:07.267 --> 00:58:08.351
I don't understand.

973
00:58:08.435 --> 00:58:10.311
I had an appointment
at 11:00.


974
00:58:10.395 --> 00:58:12.647
I arrived at 10:30
and wouldn't wait.


975
00:58:12.731 --> 00:58:15.650
I'm only here now
because I followed you back.


976
00:58:15.734 --> 00:58:17.443
So you may have
my appointment,


977
00:58:17.528 --> 00:58:19.278
for which you
are just in time.


978
00:58:19.363 --> 00:58:21.197
That's very good of you,
but I'm afraid I can't...


979
00:58:21.281 --> 00:58:23.116
Now, my dear young woman,

980
00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:25.409
if you will set aside
your book of social graces


981
00:58:25.494 --> 00:58:27.203
for just long enough
to seize an opportunity


982
00:58:27.287 --> 00:58:29.163
that you want very much

983
00:58:29.248 --> 00:58:32.834
by merely indulging a small
natural selfish instinct.


984
00:58:32.918 --> 00:58:35.336
Without doubt, sir, you are
the most forward gentleman


985
00:58:35.420 --> 00:58:36.671
I have ever encountered.

986
00:58:36.755 --> 00:58:38.172
Without doubt.

987
00:58:38.257 --> 00:58:39.674
Mr. Fairley.

988
00:58:39.758 --> 00:58:42.176
- Forward.
- No, no. I couldn't.


989
00:58:42.261 --> 00:58:44.428
- It's quite all right.
- No, really.


990
00:58:46.765 --> 00:58:48.266
Here now...

991
00:58:48.350 --> 00:58:51.269
She's mad about you.
Couldn't you tell?


992
00:58:51.353 --> 00:58:52.895
Come in, Fairley.
Come in.


993
00:58:52.980 --> 00:58:54.355
Your new book is terrible,

994
00:58:54.439 --> 00:58:57.483
the most awful trash
I've had on my desk since...


995
00:58:57.985 --> 00:58:59.068
Who are you?

996
00:59:00.320 --> 00:59:02.697
I'm... That is...

997
00:59:02.781 --> 00:59:03.865
Who let you in?

998
00:59:03.949 --> 00:59:06.576
Why, the gentleman outside
said it was all right.


999
00:59:06.660 --> 00:59:08.578
He did, did he?

1000
00:59:08.662 --> 00:59:10.121
Well, it isn't all right,

1001
00:59:10.205 --> 00:59:11.747
and I'll trouble you
take yourself elsewhere.


1002
00:59:11.832 --> 00:59:14.125
Please, Mr. Sproule.

1003
00:59:14.209 --> 00:59:16.919
I simply had to get in
to see you.


1004
00:59:17.004 --> 00:59:18.129
I have a manuscript.

1005
00:59:18.213 --> 00:59:20.006
Of course you have.

1006
00:59:20.090 --> 00:59:22.925
20 million discontented females
in the British Isles


1007
00:59:23.010 --> 00:59:25.094
and every blessed one of them
is writing a novel.


1008
00:59:25.179 --> 00:59:27.430
Don't tell me what's in it.
I know.


1009
00:59:27.514 --> 00:59:30.099
Bless my soul, madam,
I've got to publish this bilge


1010
00:59:30.184 --> 00:59:32.894
in order to stay in business,
but I don't have to read it.


1011
00:59:32.978 --> 00:59:34.604
No, madam, I do not.

1012
00:59:34.688 --> 00:59:36.939
And now if you'll pardon me,
I'm busy.


1013
00:59:37.024 --> 00:59:39.358
<i>Come back here,
you blasted grampus!</i>


1014
00:59:45.365 --> 00:59:46.657
Madam.

1015
00:59:49.536 --> 00:59:51.370
You're such
a nice-looking woman, too.


1016
00:59:51.455 --> 00:59:54.290
I'm terribly sorry,
Mr. Sproule.


1017
00:59:54.374 --> 00:59:56.292
I didn't mean to say that,

1018
00:59:56.376 --> 00:59:58.294
but you're all wrong
about the book.


1019
00:59:58.378 --> 01:00:01.297
It isn't what you think at all.

1020
01:00:01.381 --> 01:00:02.965
It's a biography.

1021
01:00:03.050 --> 01:00:05.801
It's the unvarnished record
of a sailor's life.


1022
01:00:05.886 --> 01:00:07.845
A sailor's life, eh?

1023
01:00:10.766 --> 01:00:12.683
I ask your pardon, madam,

1024
01:00:12.768 --> 01:00:14.143
but what do you know
about sailors?


1025
01:00:14.228 --> 01:00:16.145
A great deal, believe me.

1026
01:00:18.273 --> 01:00:20.733
Unvarnished, you say?

1027
01:00:21.318 --> 01:00:24.862
Well, perhaps I have time
for a few pages, at that.


1028
01:00:37.793 --> 01:00:40.294
- What's your name?
- Mrs. Muir.


1029
01:00:55.352 --> 01:00:58.229
I have been waiting here
for three hours.


1030
01:00:58.313 --> 01:01:00.189
I consider it outrageous!

1031
01:01:12.327 --> 01:01:13.744
Still in there?

1032
01:01:13.829 --> 01:01:15.454
Sent luncheon in at 2:00.

1033
01:01:15.539 --> 01:01:16.914
For two?

1034
01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:30.136
Well! You're not going to pretend
that you wrote this.


1035
01:01:30.220 --> 01:01:31.345
No.

1036
01:01:31.430 --> 01:01:33.389
No. It's a man's book,

1037
01:01:33.473 --> 01:01:35.391
and what a man.

1038
01:01:35.475 --> 01:01:37.852
Is he your husband,
Mrs. Muir?


1039
01:01:37.936 --> 01:01:39.478
Oh, no.

1040
01:01:41.023 --> 01:01:44.692
This Captain X,
I'd like very much to meet him.


1041
01:01:44.776 --> 01:01:47.361
I'm afraid
that's impossible.


1042
01:01:47.446 --> 01:01:49.030
He's away.

1043
01:01:49.114 --> 01:01:50.197
On a voyage, of course.

1044
01:01:50.282 --> 01:01:53.117
Yes. A very long voyage.

1045
01:01:53.201 --> 01:01:56.370
Bless my soul,
what a yarn!


1046
01:01:56.455 --> 01:01:58.748
What a life!

1047
01:01:58.832 --> 01:02:00.249
I'll tell you a secret.

1048
01:02:00.334 --> 01:02:03.252
If I hadn't had a mother
and two sisters to support,


1049
01:02:03.337 --> 01:02:05.254
I'd have gone
to sea myself.


1050
01:02:05.339 --> 01:02:08.257
Bless my soul,
to live like that!


1051
01:02:08.342 --> 01:02:10.843
Instead of sitting there
turning out


1052
01:02:10.927 --> 01:02:13.346
indigestible reading matter
for a bilious public.


1053
01:02:14.681 --> 01:02:17.058
Of course we'll publish it,
Mrs. Muir.


1054
01:02:17.142 --> 01:02:18.934
Now, you're empowered by
the captain to act for him?


1055
01:02:19.019 --> 01:02:20.936
Yes. He's given me the rights.

1056
01:02:21.021 --> 01:02:22.938
Good. Well, my dear,

1057
01:02:23.023 --> 01:02:25.858
you presented me
with a most enjoyable day.


1058
01:02:25.942 --> 01:02:28.361
Bless my soul,
yes, remarkable.


1059
01:02:28.445 --> 01:02:30.446
Now, you just leave
everything to me


1060
01:02:30.530 --> 01:02:32.865
and be happy that
you know such a man.


1061
01:02:32.949 --> 01:02:35.242
There aren't many
like him these days.


1062
01:02:35.327 --> 01:02:36.786
You appreciate that?

1063
01:02:36.870 --> 01:02:38.371
Yes, I think so.

1064
01:02:39.873 --> 01:02:41.374
Well, goodbye, Mr. Sproule.

1065
01:02:41.458 --> 01:02:42.917
Goodbye, Mrs. Muir.

1066
01:02:43.001 --> 01:02:44.126
Goodbye.

1067
01:02:50.550 --> 01:02:52.218
Mr. Fairley.

1068
01:02:52.344 --> 01:02:53.761
Coming.

1069
01:03:08.902 --> 01:03:10.111
It's easy to understand

1070
01:03:10.195 --> 01:03:12.655
why the most beautiful poems
about England in the spring


1071
01:03:12.739 --> 01:03:15.074
were written by poets
living in Italy at the time.


1072
01:03:15.158 --> 01:03:16.325
How do you do?

1073
01:03:16.410 --> 01:03:18.035
I'm not a poet,
but I've got an umbrella,


1074
01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:19.578
and your hat,
if I may say so,


1075
01:03:19.663 --> 01:03:22.081
is singularly inadequate
under the circumstances.


1076
01:03:22.165 --> 01:03:25.334
I didn't bargain
for this blasted rain.


1077
01:03:25.419 --> 01:03:26.961
That is, I'm afraid
I shall be late


1078
01:03:27.045 --> 01:03:29.839
and miss the last train
for home.


1079
01:03:29.923 --> 01:03:31.674
I could call you a cab,

1080
01:03:33.051 --> 01:03:34.969
if you ask nicely.

1081
01:03:38.098 --> 01:03:40.099
Oy! Cab!

1082
01:03:53.655 --> 01:03:55.489
- Where to?
- Victoria.


1083
01:03:55.574 --> 01:03:57.992
Victoria. What a coincidence.
Victoria, cabby.


1084
01:04:02.664 --> 01:04:05.291
I know you won't mind
sharing my cab with me, will you?


1085
01:04:05.375 --> 01:04:06.959
Not at all.

1086
01:04:10.338 --> 01:04:12.756
The word you're looking for is "brass."

1087
01:04:12.841 --> 01:04:14.258
Brass?

1088
01:04:14.342 --> 01:04:15.509
To describe my behavior and me.

1089
01:04:15.594 --> 01:04:17.219
You don't approve of either, do you?

1090
01:04:17.304 --> 01:04:18.762
Not very much.

1091
01:04:18.847 --> 01:04:21.140
Still, in a way I
should be grateful to you.

1092
01:04:21.224 --> 01:04:24.059
Of course, why?

1093
01:04:24.144 --> 01:04:27.396
Because Mr. Sproule has agreed
to publish my book.


1094
01:04:27.481 --> 01:04:30.232
Splendid. So the old boy

1095
01:04:30.317 --> 01:04:32.276
has developed a weakness
for feminine literature, has he?


1096
01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:34.778
I can't say
that it's one of mine.


1097
01:04:34.863 --> 01:04:37.781
This book
might surprise you.


1098
01:04:37.866 --> 01:04:39.033
It's surprising enough

1099
01:04:39.117 --> 01:04:41.911
to find a lady author
infinitely more exciting


1100
01:04:41.995 --> 01:04:44.246
than her heroine
could possibly be.


1101
01:04:45.874 --> 01:04:48.292
Do you write, Mr...

1102
01:04:48.376 --> 01:04:50.836
My name is Miles Fairley.
Yes, I write a little.


1103
01:04:50.921 --> 01:04:52.296
Children's books.

1104
01:04:52.380 --> 01:04:54.798
Children's books? You?

1105
01:04:54.883 --> 01:04:56.800
I should like to see one.

1106
01:04:56.885 --> 01:04:58.802
I'm afraid you already have.

1107
01:04:58.887 --> 01:05:02.765
I write under the name
of Uncle Neddy.


1108
01:05:02.849 --> 01:05:05.768
Uncle Neddy?
You're Uncle Neddy?


1109
01:05:05.852 --> 01:05:07.770
Ridiculous, isn't it?

1110
01:05:07.854 --> 01:05:10.773
Then all of your cynicism
must be nothing but a pose.


1111
01:05:10.857 --> 01:05:13.776
You're adored by half
the children in the world.


1112
01:05:13.860 --> 01:05:15.611
Uncle Neddy is a pose.

1113
01:05:15.695 --> 01:05:17.613
Deep in
my innermost heart,


1114
01:05:17.697 --> 01:05:19.615
I loathe
the little monsters.


1115
01:05:20.367 --> 01:05:22.785
My little daughter
is not a monster,


1116
01:05:22.869 --> 01:05:24.787
and she'll be
very excited to know


1117
01:05:24.871 --> 01:05:27.289
I've been talking
to her favorite author.


1118
01:05:27.374 --> 01:05:30.292
I shall make an exception
of your daughter.


1119
01:05:30.377 --> 01:05:32.169
I'm looking forward
to meeting her


1120
01:05:32.254 --> 01:05:34.171
and your husband, too.

1121
01:05:34.256 --> 01:05:36.340
- My husband is dead.
- Oh.


1122
01:05:41.221 --> 01:05:43.347
I do wish he'd hurry.

1123
01:05:44.724 --> 01:05:47.017
Well, there's no rush now.

1124
01:05:47.102 --> 01:05:49.228
We'll get there in time.

1125
01:05:54.442 --> 01:05:56.068
Here's an empty one.

1126
01:05:59.281 --> 01:06:01.156
Well, goodbye, Mrs. Muir.

1127
01:06:01.241 --> 01:06:03.325
Goodbye, Mr. Fairley,
and thank you very much.


1128
01:06:03.410 --> 01:06:05.244
Not at all.
Are you all right?


1129
01:06:05.328 --> 01:06:07.913
Yes, quite all right.
Thank you.


1130
01:06:09.124 --> 01:06:10.916
Cheero!

1131
01:06:42.115 --> 01:06:44.283
- "Cheero."
- Oh.


1132
01:06:44.993 --> 01:06:46.702
You've been eavesdropping.

1133
01:06:46.786 --> 01:06:48.704
"Feminine literature."

1134
01:06:48.788 --> 01:06:50.706
What's he mean,
"Feminine literature"?


1135
01:06:50.790 --> 01:06:52.708
He had no way of knowing
it's your book.


1136
01:06:52.792 --> 01:06:54.209
Brass, he says.

1137
01:06:54.294 --> 01:06:57.212
I'll polish his brass for him.

1138
01:06:57.297 --> 01:06:58.714
And the way he was
smirking at you,


1139
01:06:58.798 --> 01:07:00.633
like a cat
at a fishmonger's.


1140
01:07:00.717 --> 01:07:01.842
You should have
slapped his face.


1141
01:07:01.926 --> 01:07:05.638
Why? I found him rather charming.

1142
01:07:05.722 --> 01:07:08.641
Rather charming.
Now you're starting to talk like him.


1143
01:07:08.725 --> 01:07:10.059
How in blazes do
you want me to talk?

1144
01:07:10.143 --> 01:07:11.185
That's better.

1145
01:07:11.269 --> 01:07:14.313
I think you're being
extremely childish.


1146
01:07:14.397 --> 01:07:15.648
I'm only trying to
protect you


1147
01:07:15.732 --> 01:07:16.815
from your
own worse instincts.


1148
01:07:16.900 --> 01:07:19.151
I'll manage my own instincts,
thank you.


1149
01:07:19.235 --> 01:07:20.402
What made you lie
to the blighter?


1150
01:07:20.487 --> 01:07:21.570
I didn't lie to him.

1151
01:07:21.655 --> 01:07:23.781
You did.
You told him he was Anna's favorite author.


1152
01:07:23.865 --> 01:07:26.408
You know perfectly well
she hates Uncle Neddy


1153
01:07:26.493 --> 01:07:29.620
and reads nothing but <i>Deadeye Dick,</i>
<i>the Rover of the Spanish Main.</i>


1154
01:07:29.704 --> 01:07:31.664
Well, I had to say something.

1155
01:07:31.748 --> 01:07:35.167
Hmm. You should have
pushed him out of the cab.


1156
01:07:35.251 --> 01:07:37.836
In another minute,
I would have.


1157
01:07:38.421 --> 01:07:41.131
Why, Daniel,
I believe you're jealous.


1158
01:07:41.216 --> 01:07:42.508
Of course
I'm not jealous!


1159
01:07:42.592 --> 01:07:45.177
Do you take me
for a blasted schoolboy?


1160
01:07:45.261 --> 01:07:47.805
Besides, jealousy
is a disease of the flesh.


1161
01:07:47.889 --> 01:07:50.641
I've never known you
to be so disagreeable,


1162
01:07:50.725 --> 01:07:52.518
today of all days.

1163
01:07:52.602 --> 01:07:54.478
What's so wonderful
about today?


1164
01:07:54.562 --> 01:07:55.979
The book, Daniel.

1165
01:07:56.064 --> 01:07:57.815
Mr. Sproule liked the book.

1166
01:07:57.899 --> 01:08:00.109
Of course he liked it.

1167
01:08:00.193 --> 01:08:02.611
And now I can buy
the house.


1168
01:08:06.199 --> 01:08:08.117
Just as we planned.

1169
01:08:08.201 --> 01:08:09.618
I'm not sure
I want you to have


1170
01:08:09.703 --> 01:08:11.286
the blasted house after all.

1171
01:08:11.371 --> 01:08:13.622
Oh, Daniel, please.

1172
01:08:13.707 --> 01:08:17.126
I suppose being a woman,
you can't help it.


1173
01:08:17.210 --> 01:08:18.627
Can't help what?

1174
01:08:18.712 --> 01:08:20.629
Making a fool of yourself.

1175
01:08:20.714 --> 01:08:23.132
Daniel, you stop sulking.

1176
01:08:23.216 --> 01:08:26.135
You yourself said that
I should mix with people,


1177
01:08:26.219 --> 01:08:28.804
that I should see men.

1178
01:08:28.888 --> 01:08:31.640
I said men, not perfumed
parlor snakes.


1179
01:08:31.725 --> 01:08:34.643
He's a man
and a very nice one.


1180
01:08:34.728 --> 01:08:37.604
Anyway, I shall never
see him again.


1181
01:08:40.400 --> 01:08:43.152
Cheer off, you blasted mud turtle!
There's no room!


1182
01:08:43.236 --> 01:08:45.237
I beg your pardon, madam.

1183
01:09:12.056 --> 01:09:14.975
Will my name stay there
forever, Mr. Scroggins?


1184
01:09:15.059 --> 01:09:16.977
Mmm-hmm. Forever and a day,

1185
01:09:17.061 --> 01:09:18.520
and I've cut it
nice and deep


1186
01:09:18.605 --> 01:09:22.483
so all the ships at sea
can see it as they sail along.


1187
01:09:22.567 --> 01:09:24.985
My goodness!

1188
01:09:32.076 --> 01:09:33.285
Mummy!

1189
01:09:35.413 --> 01:09:38.624
Mummy, come and see
what Mr. Scroggins has done!


1190
01:09:38.708 --> 01:09:40.626
I'll be right out, darling!

1191
01:10:01.105 --> 01:10:03.232
Mr. Scroggins says
I'll always be here,


1192
01:10:03.316 --> 01:10:04.858
and all the captains
of all the ships


1193
01:10:04.943 --> 01:10:07.194
will look at me
through spyglasses.


1194
01:10:07.278 --> 01:10:09.613
Why, that's very thoughtful
of Mr. Scroggins.


1195
01:10:09.697 --> 01:10:11.198
Just think of all
the lovely shipwrecks


1196
01:10:11.282 --> 01:10:12.741
we'll have on this beach.

1197
01:10:12.826 --> 01:10:14.743
Now, in the meantime,
what do you say to getting dressed


1198
01:10:14.828 --> 01:10:15.994
and plotting
our course for home?


1199
01:10:16.079 --> 01:10:18.247
Oh, please, Mummy!
Mr. Scroggins and I


1200
01:10:18.331 --> 01:10:20.582
have got to build
a breakwater and a canal!


1201
01:10:20.667 --> 01:10:23.210
I'll be pleased
to bring her home, ma'am.


1202
01:10:23.294 --> 01:10:26.213
All right, Skipper,
but mind you're not too late.


1203
01:11:09.883 --> 01:11:12.676
Life is just one coincidence
after another, isn't it?


1204
01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:15.095
Thank you for returning
my handkerchief, Mr. Fairley.


1205
01:11:15.179 --> 01:11:16.680
I feel rather ashamed
about having taken it.


1206
01:11:16.764 --> 01:11:17.931
You should be.

1207
01:11:18.016 --> 01:11:19.182
Only as a writer,
of course.


1208
01:11:19.267 --> 01:11:20.976
It was much
too obvious a device.


1209
01:11:21.060 --> 01:11:22.352
And in questionable taste.

1210
01:11:22.437 --> 01:11:24.021
But very necessary.

1211
01:11:24.105 --> 01:11:25.856
I wanted to have
something of you


1212
01:11:25.940 --> 01:11:27.608
until I saw you again.

1213
01:11:31.070 --> 01:11:33.530
You're quite accomplished,
aren't you?


1214
01:11:33.615 --> 01:11:35.365
I should think
being Uncle Neddy


1215
01:11:35.450 --> 01:11:37.367
would satisfy anyone.

1216
01:11:37.452 --> 01:11:39.620
No. I also paint,

1217
01:11:39.704 --> 01:11:41.371
under the name of Renoir.

1218
01:11:41.456 --> 01:11:42.873
You're such a fool.

1219
01:11:42.957 --> 01:11:44.499
That's the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.


1220
01:11:44.584 --> 01:11:47.044
And what, if anything,
do you do as Miles Fairley?


1221
01:11:47.128 --> 01:11:48.879
Play the fool, generally.

1222
01:11:49.297 --> 01:11:51.006
Specifically, I behave
quite idiotically


1223
01:11:51.090 --> 01:11:53.342
towards a certain young lady
that I fell in love with


1224
01:11:53.426 --> 01:11:55.510
while passing on a stair.

1225
01:11:55.595 --> 01:11:57.179
Mr. Fairley, please.

1226
01:11:57.263 --> 01:11:59.181
I have no illusions
about my conduct.


1227
01:12:00.099 --> 01:12:02.768
Am I being unforgivably
offensive, Lucy?


1228
01:12:02.852 --> 01:12:04.227
Lucy?

1229
01:12:04.312 --> 01:12:06.229
That's your name.

1230
01:12:06.314 --> 01:12:09.733
It's been so long
since anyone called me that.


1231
01:12:09.817 --> 01:12:13.362
No, you've done nothing
really unforgivable.


1232
01:12:13.446 --> 01:12:16.239
It's just that I'm not...

1233
01:12:16.324 --> 01:12:18.825
Come and take a look
at my canvas.


1234
01:12:20.620 --> 01:12:22.829
Why, it's me.

1235
01:12:22.914 --> 01:12:25.332
You've been painting me.

1236
01:12:25.416 --> 01:12:27.084
You've been
watching me bathe.


1237
01:12:27.168 --> 01:12:29.628
But always from
a respectable distance.


1238
01:12:31.714 --> 01:12:34.549
Not too bad, is it?

1239
01:12:34.634 --> 01:12:37.970
I think
it's very flattering, really...


1240
01:12:38.930 --> 01:12:41.848
It will need
a thousand Renoirs.


1241
01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:51.358
That was unforgivable,
wasn't it?


1242
01:12:53.152 --> 01:12:55.904
But I shall not go away,
even if you send me,


1243
01:12:55.989 --> 01:12:59.366
and I shall see you again,
even if you forbid it.


1244
01:12:59.450 --> 01:13:02.285
I'm sure I have no control
over where you go


1245
01:13:02.370 --> 01:13:04.788
or what you do.

1246
01:13:04.872 --> 01:13:06.832
Then you won't forbid it.

1247
01:13:31.524 --> 01:13:34.693
So now you've been kissed
in the orchard all over again.


1248
01:13:34.777 --> 01:13:36.194
You've been spying on me.

1249
01:13:36.279 --> 01:13:38.405
I merely happened to be
cruising in the vicinity.


1250
01:13:38.489 --> 01:13:39.614
I don't believe you.

1251
01:13:39.699 --> 01:13:41.074
Why did you let him?

1252
01:13:41.159 --> 01:13:44.327
I didn't.
He took me unaware.


1253
01:13:46.039 --> 01:13:47.914
My dear,
since Eve picked the apple,


1254
01:13:47.999 --> 01:13:50.917
no woman's ever been
taken entirely unawares.


1255
01:13:51.002 --> 01:13:53.045
Just what do you mean
to insinuate by that?


1256
01:13:53.129 --> 01:13:54.296
When a woman's kissed,

1257
01:13:54.380 --> 01:13:57.424
it's because deep down
she wants to be kissed.


1258
01:13:57.508 --> 01:13:59.676
That is nothing
but masculine conceit.


1259
01:13:59.761 --> 01:14:01.720
Nevertheless, it's true.

1260
01:14:01.804 --> 01:14:02.971
Well, now what happens?

1261
01:14:03.056 --> 01:14:04.806
He'll stay, or he'll go away.

1262
01:14:04.891 --> 01:14:07.309
It doesn't matter to me
one way or the other.


1263
01:14:08.061 --> 01:14:10.520
I think it matters to you
more than you'll admit.


1264
01:14:10.938 --> 01:14:12.064
Isn't that so, Lucia?

1265
01:14:12.148 --> 01:14:13.690
Why bother
to ask me, Daniel?


1266
01:14:13.775 --> 01:14:16.735
You seem to know my mind
better than I do.


1267
01:14:17.445 --> 01:14:19.863
You don't like him, do you?

1268
01:14:19.947 --> 01:14:21.406
He puts brilliantine
on his hair.


1269
01:14:21.491 --> 01:14:22.657
Most men do.

1270
01:14:22.742 --> 01:14:25.410
And he uses perfume.
Blasted near drove me out of his room.


1271
01:14:25.495 --> 01:14:27.329
You shouldn't have been
in his room in the first place.


1272
01:14:27.413 --> 01:14:28.830
So you can find an excuse
for everything.


1273
01:14:28.915 --> 01:14:31.124
Only because you're
attacking him, Daniel.


1274
01:14:31.209 --> 01:14:33.335
I know. It's a natural human reaction.

1275
01:14:33.419 --> 01:14:35.337
I wish you wouldn't be so superior

1276
01:14:35.421 --> 01:14:37.839
just because you're not alive.

1277
01:14:37.924 --> 01:14:39.925
And he is, very much so.

1278
01:14:40.009 --> 01:14:41.760
It's no crime to be alive.

1279
01:14:41.844 --> 01:14:45.055
No, my dear.
Sometimes it's a great inconvenience.


1280
01:14:45.139 --> 01:14:46.932
The living can be hurt.

1281
01:14:47.016 --> 01:14:48.767
I don't intend to be hurt.

1282
01:14:48.851 --> 01:14:51.686
No captain intends to pile his ship
up on a reef, but it happens.


1283
01:14:51.771 --> 01:14:53.814
You yourself said I should
go about in the world.


1284
01:14:53.898 --> 01:14:56.358
That means taking risks.

1285
01:14:56.442 --> 01:14:58.693
I know, my dear.

1286
01:14:58.778 --> 01:15:01.488
Real happiness is
worth almost any risk,


1287
01:15:01.572 --> 01:15:02.906
but be careful.

1288
01:15:03.866 --> 01:15:05.951
There may be
breakers ahead.


1289
01:15:08.454 --> 01:15:09.830
I will, Daniel.

1290
01:15:39.610 --> 01:15:42.028
- Hello, Martha.
- Hello.


1291
01:15:42.113 --> 01:15:43.530
Like my picture?

1292
01:15:43.614 --> 01:15:44.739
No.

1293
01:15:44.824 --> 01:15:46.700
That's honest, anyway.

1294
01:15:46.784 --> 01:15:48.869
It's indecent,
that's what it is.


1295
01:15:48.953 --> 01:15:52.455
Him painting you in your
bathing costume like you was a...


1296
01:15:52.540 --> 01:15:53.623
I don't know what.

1297
01:15:53.708 --> 01:15:57.544
Oh, come, Martha.
This is the 20th century.


1298
01:15:57.628 --> 01:16:01.131
We must rid ourselves
of the old fetishes and taboos.


1299
01:16:01.215 --> 01:16:03.383
Learnt a lot
of new words, ain't you?


1300
01:16:03.467 --> 01:16:04.843
We're never
too old to learn.


1301
01:16:04.927 --> 01:16:07.345
No. Nor to make fools of ourselves either.

1302
01:16:07.471 --> 01:16:08.889
"Uncle Neddy."

1303
01:16:11.350 --> 01:16:15.187
All right, my girl.
Let's have it.


1304
01:16:15.271 --> 01:16:18.106
What's he up to?
What's he want with you?


1305
01:16:18.191 --> 01:16:20.525
Well, I rather think he's going
to ask me to marry him.


1306
01:16:20.610 --> 01:16:22.027
And you'd be willing to.

1307
01:16:22.111 --> 01:16:24.029
I might.
Why shouldn't I?


1308
01:16:24.113 --> 01:16:26.781
Because he ain't good enough
for you, that's why not.


1309
01:16:26.866 --> 01:16:29.451
He's the kind of man
no decent woman would associate with.


1310
01:16:29.535 --> 01:16:30.994
Martha, what right have you
to talk like that?


1311
01:16:31.078 --> 01:16:32.495
Well, I got a right
to me own feelings,


1312
01:16:32.580 --> 01:16:34.289
and I got a feeling about him.

1313
01:16:34.373 --> 01:16:35.790
How dare you!

1314
01:16:36.584 --> 01:16:38.043
I'm sorry.

1315
01:16:39.003 --> 01:16:41.421
It's just that I've been
so worried about you lately.


1316
01:16:42.590 --> 01:16:46.009
Now, Martha.
There's nothing to worry about.


1317
01:16:46.093 --> 01:16:48.678
I know he isn't perfect.

1318
01:16:48.763 --> 01:16:53.016
Perhaps he's conceited
and erratic,


1319
01:16:53.100 --> 01:16:55.060
even childish,

1320
01:16:55.811 --> 01:16:56.937
but he's real.

1321
01:16:59.023 --> 01:17:00.357
Real?

1322
01:17:00.441 --> 01:17:03.193
I thought I was impervious
to emotion,


1323
01:17:03.277 --> 01:17:05.528
a respectable widow woman
with a growing child


1324
01:17:05.613 --> 01:17:07.572
and a hide
like a rhinoceros,


1325
01:17:08.616 --> 01:17:10.367
but I'm not.

1326
01:17:10.451 --> 01:17:13.203
I need companionship
and laughter


1327
01:17:13.287 --> 01:17:16.414
and all the things
a woman needs.


1328
01:17:17.959 --> 01:17:20.835
I suppose I need love.

1329
01:17:22.088 --> 01:17:25.423
Well, I hope
he can give it to you.


1330
01:17:26.717 --> 01:17:28.176
Now, suppose you
go on downstairs


1331
01:17:28.261 --> 01:17:30.095
and make us both
a cup of tea.


1332
01:17:32.139 --> 01:17:33.556
I'll finish up.

1333
01:17:33.641 --> 01:17:35.100
Yes, ma'am.

1334
01:17:54.161 --> 01:17:55.620
Well, Daniel,

1335
01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.501
haven't you anything to say?

1336
01:18:12.638 --> 01:18:13.888
Happy?

1337
01:18:13.973 --> 01:18:16.891
I've never
felt like this before.


1338
01:18:16.976 --> 01:18:18.226
How?

1339
01:18:18.311 --> 01:18:19.394
I don't know.

1340
01:18:19.478 --> 01:18:20.895
Tell me.

1341
01:18:23.190 --> 01:18:27.235
Like looking
down from high up,


1342
01:18:27.320 --> 01:18:29.612
all dizzy and unsure.

1343
01:18:29.697 --> 01:18:32.324
You won't fall.
I'll hold you.


1344
01:18:32.450 --> 01:18:35.076
It isn't right, it can't be,
to feel like this,


1345
01:18:35.161 --> 01:18:37.579
like, I don't know.

1346
01:18:37.663 --> 01:18:40.582
It is right
because you're happy.


1347
01:18:46.005 --> 01:18:49.341
Martha's gone up.
It's Anna's bedtime.


1348
01:18:49.425 --> 01:18:52.010
Just this once,
pretend you've forgotten.


1349
01:18:52.094 --> 01:18:53.928
But I didn't.

1350
01:18:54.013 --> 01:18:55.722
Just this one night.

1351
01:18:57.099 --> 01:18:59.517
There'll be so many nights,
darling,


1352
01:18:59.602 --> 01:19:02.437
two lifetimes full,
till we're both old


1353
01:19:02.521 --> 01:19:05.482
and even Anna's
grown and married, too.


1354
01:19:06.650 --> 01:19:08.735
What's wrong?

1355
01:19:08.819 --> 01:19:10.445
I'm jealous.

1356
01:19:10.529 --> 01:19:12.113
I'm even jealous
of a little girl.


1357
01:19:12.198 --> 01:19:13.948
But she's my daughter.

1358
01:19:14.033 --> 01:19:15.950
I can't just forget
my duty to her.


1359
01:19:16.035 --> 01:19:17.118
When you're with me,

1360
01:19:17.203 --> 01:19:19.788
I want you to forget about
everyone else in the world,


1361
01:19:19.872 --> 01:19:21.539
your duty, and what
the world will say.


1362
01:19:21.665 --> 01:19:23.958
I think you
must be a magician.


1363
01:19:24.043 --> 01:19:26.461
You make it seem all wrong
to consider my duty


1364
01:19:26.545 --> 01:19:28.588
and only right that I...

1365
01:19:50.444 --> 01:19:54.197
I thought you were
one woman with sense,


1366
01:19:54.281 --> 01:19:56.741
but you're like
all the rest of them.


1367
01:19:57.326 --> 01:20:00.412
Fall for any man
who'll promise you the moon


1368
01:20:00.496 --> 01:20:03.581
and end by taking everything
you have to give.


1369
01:20:06.293 --> 01:20:09.337
Oh, don't trouble yourself,
my dear.


1370
01:20:09.422 --> 01:20:11.840
It's not your fault.

1371
01:20:11.924 --> 01:20:15.343
I should have known
it was on the chart.


1372
01:20:15.428 --> 01:20:16.553
You've made your choice,

1373
01:20:16.637 --> 01:20:18.346
the only choice
you could make.


1374
01:20:18.431 --> 01:20:19.848
You've chosen life,

1375
01:20:20.641 --> 01:20:23.518
and that's as it should be,

1376
01:20:23.602 --> 01:20:25.437
whatever the reckoning.

1377
01:20:26.439 --> 01:20:29.357
And that's why
I'm going away, my dear.


1378
01:20:29.442 --> 01:20:32.360
I can't help you now.

1379
01:20:32.445 --> 01:20:34.028
I can only confuse you more

1380
01:20:34.113 --> 01:20:37.532
and destroy whatever chance
you have left of happiness.


1381
01:20:38.451 --> 01:20:40.118
You must make your own life

1382
01:20:40.703 --> 01:20:42.537
amongst the living.

1383
01:20:44.498 --> 01:20:47.459
And whether you'll meet
fair winds or foul,


1384
01:20:49.295 --> 01:20:52.881
find your own way to harbor
in the end.


1385
01:20:58.637 --> 01:21:01.139
Lucia, listen to me.

1386
01:21:01.974 --> 01:21:04.350
Listen, my dear.

1387
01:21:04.435 --> 01:21:06.853
You've been dreaming,

1388
01:21:06.937 --> 01:21:08.855
dreaming of a sea captain

1389
01:21:08.939 --> 01:21:10.857
that haunted this house,

1390
01:21:10.941 --> 01:21:13.359
of talks you had with him,

1391
01:21:13.444 --> 01:21:16.863
even a book
you both wrote together,


1392
01:21:16.947 --> 01:21:21.868
but, Lucia,
you wrote the book,


1393
01:21:21.952 --> 01:21:25.371
you and no one else.

1394
01:21:26.582 --> 01:21:28.875
The book you imagined
from his house,


1395
01:21:28.959 --> 01:21:30.335
from his picture
on the wall,


1396
01:21:30.419 --> 01:21:33.338
from his gear
lying around in every room.


1397
01:21:37.968 --> 01:21:41.554
It's been a dream, Lucia.

1398
01:21:49.730 --> 01:21:53.024
And in the morning
and the years after,


1399
01:21:53.484 --> 01:21:56.611
you'll only remember it
as a dream,


1400
01:21:57.571 --> 01:21:59.822
and it'll die,

1401
01:21:59.907 --> 01:22:03.618
as all dreams
must die at waking.


1402
01:22:12.211 --> 01:22:14.963
How you'd have
loved the North Cape


1403
01:22:15.047 --> 01:22:17.507
and the fjords and
the midnight sun,


1404
01:22:17.591 --> 01:22:20.051
to sail across the reef
at Barbados,


1405
01:22:20.135 --> 01:22:23.137
where the blue water
turns to green,


1406
01:22:23.222 --> 01:22:24.305
to the Falklands

1407
01:22:24.390 --> 01:22:28.101
where a southerly gale
rips the whole sea white!


1408
01:22:28.227 --> 01:22:31.729
What we've missed, Lucia!

1409
01:22:33.399 --> 01:22:36.734
What we've both missed.

1410
01:22:39.655 --> 01:22:43.741
Goodbye, my darling.

1411
01:23:03.220 --> 01:23:06.848
Listen to this.
From Mr. Sproule.


1412
01:23:06.932 --> 01:23:09.684
It's about the book
I've written.


1413
01:23:09.768 --> 01:23:16.232
"Our check for £100
advance royalties


1414
01:23:16.317 --> 01:23:17.942
"as you requested."

1415
01:23:18.027 --> 01:23:20.361
You mean to tell me they paid you
good money for that?


1416
01:23:20.446 --> 01:23:22.864
Martha, have you
been reading my book?


1417
01:23:22.948 --> 01:23:24.115
I'm supposed
to dust in here,


1418
01:23:24.199 --> 01:23:26.117
and what falls under me eye
falls under me eye.


1419
01:23:26.201 --> 01:23:28.494
I'm surprised at you.
It's like eavesdropping.


1420
01:23:28.579 --> 01:23:32.373
I'm surprised at you.
Such language! Lummy.


1421
01:23:32.458 --> 01:23:34.375
Well, if you're writing
about a sea captain,


1422
01:23:34.460 --> 01:23:36.836
you have to use the sort
of language he would use.


1423
01:23:36.920 --> 01:23:40.048
He'd have a hard time
living up to your idea of him.


1424
01:23:40.132 --> 01:23:44.385
Mr. Sproule wants me to come
into town to sign some papers,


1425
01:23:44.470 --> 01:23:47.388
but I can't possibly
leave here now just when...


1426
01:23:47.473 --> 01:23:48.890
Just when what?

1427
01:23:50.643 --> 01:23:52.393
I'm expecting Mr. Fairley.

1428
01:23:52.478 --> 01:23:53.895
We're having a picnic.

1429
01:23:54.355 --> 01:23:56.105
You mean he is.

1430
01:23:56.732 --> 01:23:59.233
I heard you, Martha.

1431
01:23:59.318 --> 01:24:02.487
Please remember
that I'm going to marry him.


1432
01:24:02.571 --> 01:24:03.988
Yes, ma'am.

1433
01:24:06.283 --> 01:24:08.076
By the way,
I've been thinking


1434
01:24:08.160 --> 01:24:11.496
we might put that portrait
of Captain Gregg up in the attic.


1435
01:24:11.580 --> 01:24:13.414
Don't you like it anymore?

1436
01:24:13.499 --> 01:24:15.917
It was a silly idea
to hang it in here.


1437
01:24:16.001 --> 01:24:18.920
I don't know
what possessed me.


1438
01:24:19.004 --> 01:24:20.463
Atmosphere, I suppose.

1439
01:24:21.382 --> 01:24:23.049
Yes, ma'am.

1440
01:24:23.133 --> 01:24:25.635
I'll hang it in my room,
if you don't mind.


1441
01:24:25.719 --> 01:24:26.928
Of course not.

1442
01:24:27.012 --> 01:24:28.137
Perhaps you can
get Uncle Neddy


1443
01:24:28.222 --> 01:24:29.931
to paint one
of himself instead.


1444
01:24:30.015 --> 01:24:31.474
Martha!

1445
01:24:43.612 --> 01:24:45.029
"Dear Mr. Sproule,

1446
01:24:45.739 --> 01:24:50.034
"I find that I am unable to leave
Whitecliff this week


1447
01:24:50.494 --> 01:24:53.246
"and hope that you..."

1448
01:24:57.793 --> 01:25:00.712
A boy brought
a note for you.


1449
01:25:07.720 --> 01:25:10.179
A billet-doux,
I dare say.


1450
01:25:14.685 --> 01:25:16.102
Oh, how terrible.

1451
01:25:16.729 --> 01:25:20.565
Mr. Fairley has been called up
to London for a few days.


1452
01:25:20.649 --> 01:25:22.567
What's so terrible about that?

1453
01:25:37.082 --> 01:25:38.332
There!

1454
01:25:39.209 --> 01:25:40.960
Is that all,
Mr. Sproule?


1455
01:25:41.044 --> 01:25:44.213
Except to deposit the checks
to your account when they come in.


1456
01:25:44.298 --> 01:25:46.591
I congratulate you, my dear,

1457
01:25:46.675 --> 01:25:49.093
and I congratulate
the captain, too.


1458
01:25:49.178 --> 01:25:50.595
Oh, the captain.

1459
01:25:50.679 --> 01:25:53.389
And I intend to hold you
to your promise to introduce us.


1460
01:25:53.474 --> 01:25:56.809
Oh, yes,
I did promise, didn't I?


1461
01:25:56.894 --> 01:25:57.935
You know,

1462
01:25:58.020 --> 01:26:00.646
someday when I've known you
a little longer, Mr. Sproule,


1463
01:26:00.773 --> 01:26:03.191
I'll tell you the truth
about the captain.


1464
01:26:03.275 --> 01:26:04.692
Goodbye
and thank you again.


1465
01:26:04.777 --> 01:26:06.444
Goodbye, Mrs. Muir.

1466
01:26:12.409 --> 01:26:14.952
Would you please give me
Mr. Fairley's address?


1467
01:26:15.037 --> 01:26:16.037
Miles Fairley?

1468
01:26:16.121 --> 01:26:17.580
Yes, please.

1469
01:26:20.584 --> 01:26:22.168
Here it is, Mrs. Muir.

1470
01:26:22.252 --> 01:26:24.170
Number 14,
Albemarle Street.


1471
01:26:24.254 --> 01:26:26.172
Thank you so much.

1472
01:26:51.281 --> 01:26:52.323
Yes, ma'am?

1473
01:26:52.407 --> 01:26:54.075
I'd like to see
Mr. Fairley, please.


1474
01:26:54.159 --> 01:26:55.451
Yes, ma'am.

1475
01:26:59.122 --> 01:27:00.248
What name, please?

1476
01:27:00.332 --> 01:27:01.374
It's Mrs. Muir.

1477
01:27:01.458 --> 01:27:04.377
Yes, ma'am.
Will you wait in there, please?


1478
01:27:32.322 --> 01:27:36.075
Mrs. Muir? The maid said
you wanted to see my husband.


1479
01:27:36.743 --> 01:27:38.703
Perhaps I can help you.

1480
01:27:38.787 --> 01:27:39.954
Husband?

1481
01:27:40.038 --> 01:27:41.831
Or if you don't mind waiting.

1482
01:27:41.915 --> 01:27:43.124
He should be back soon.

1483
01:27:43.208 --> 01:27:45.459
He's taking the children
to the park.


1484
01:27:45.544 --> 01:27:48.421
I've had them abroad
for the past few months. We just returned.


1485
01:27:48.505 --> 01:27:51.424
Miles is making up
for lost time.


1486
01:27:52.134 --> 01:27:53.551
Please sit down.

1487
01:27:54.595 --> 01:27:58.389
If you're a friend of his, you know
how fond he is of the children.


1488
01:27:59.975 --> 01:28:01.893
You are a friend of his,
aren't you?


1489
01:28:03.103 --> 01:28:04.645
I'm a writer.

1490
01:28:04.730 --> 01:28:08.190
We... Mr. Fairley and I have
the same publisher.


1491
01:28:08.942 --> 01:28:10.818
How exciting.

1492
01:28:10.903 --> 01:28:14.238
I don't often meet
one of Miles' literary friends.


1493
01:28:15.157 --> 01:28:16.824
You'll wait for him,
won't you?


1494
01:28:16.909 --> 01:28:20.077
I expect him back any minute,
and we'll have tea.


1495
01:28:20.662 --> 01:28:22.955
No, I'll go.

1496
01:28:23.040 --> 01:28:24.540
I'm afraid
I've made a mistake.


1497
01:28:24.625 --> 01:28:26.208
Mistake, Mrs. Muir?

1498
01:28:26.293 --> 01:28:28.252
Yes. I... I'm sorry.

1499
01:28:30.380 --> 01:28:32.840
I think I understand,
my dear,


1500
01:28:32.925 --> 01:28:34.592
and I'm sorry, too.

1501
01:28:34.676 --> 01:28:36.177
Truly I am.

1502
01:28:36.762 --> 01:28:41.057
You see, it isn't the first time
something like this has happened.


1503
01:28:47.022 --> 01:28:48.105
Mrs. Muir.

1504
01:29:37.072 --> 01:29:38.906
Come on in, ma'am.

1505
01:29:38.991 --> 01:29:41.909
I brought you
some nice hot milk.


1506
01:29:47.666 --> 01:29:49.333
There, there.

1507
01:29:49.960 --> 01:29:52.878
He ain't worth it.
Blast his hide.


1508
01:29:53.630 --> 01:29:55.673
He ain't worth it.

1509
01:30:27.372 --> 01:30:28.622
Where you been?

1510
01:30:28.707 --> 01:30:29.832
Just walking.

1511
01:30:29.916 --> 01:30:32.793
You've been doing a lot of walking
these last few months.


1512
01:30:32.878 --> 01:30:35.129
You mustn't go
tiring yourself out, now.


1513
01:30:35.213 --> 01:30:37.131
I'm not a bit tired.

1514
01:30:37.215 --> 01:30:38.466
Off to your room

1515
01:30:38.550 --> 01:30:41.510
and a nice bit
of shut-eye before tea.


1516
01:30:44.890 --> 01:30:47.391
Martha, do you know
what day this is?


1517
01:30:47.476 --> 01:30:48.893
Wash day.

1518
01:30:48.977 --> 01:30:53.272
Yes, but it was exactly a year ago
that we came here.


1519
01:30:53.356 --> 01:30:55.816
We went up
these stairs together,


1520
01:30:55.901 --> 01:30:58.486
and then I hurt my finger
on the window.


1521
01:30:58.570 --> 01:31:00.404
- Remember?
- Yes, ma'am.


1522
01:31:01.656 --> 01:31:03.491
Then I had a dream.

1523
01:31:03.575 --> 01:31:05.659
I remember you
telling me about it.


1524
01:31:06.453 --> 01:31:08.537
It was a very
strange dream,


1525
01:31:10.415 --> 01:31:12.208
the first of many dreams.

1526
01:31:13.376 --> 01:31:15.294
Now, then, off with your dress.

1527
01:31:16.338 --> 01:31:18.714
No. I'll rest in the big chair.

1528
01:31:18.799 --> 01:31:20.382
Whatever you say, ma'am.

1529
01:31:20.467 --> 01:31:22.093
Go on down, Rummy.

1530
01:31:26.515 --> 01:31:27.848
Thank you, Martha.

1531
01:31:28.558 --> 01:31:30.518
I'll call you in an hour.

1532
01:33:26.384 --> 01:33:27.426
Mummy!

1533
01:33:27.510 --> 01:33:29.595
Hello, Anna!

1534
01:33:38.605 --> 01:33:42.191
Anna! Darling!
This is a surprise.


1535
01:33:42.275 --> 01:33:43.567
How did you get off
from the university?


1536
01:33:43.652 --> 01:33:44.944
They don't know I'm away.

1537
01:33:45.028 --> 01:33:46.028
But...

1538
01:33:46.112 --> 01:33:47.738
Come on, Bill.
Don't be shy.


1539
01:33:47.822 --> 01:33:48.906
This is Bill, Mummy.

1540
01:33:48.990 --> 01:33:50.074
- How do you do?
- How do you do?


1541
01:33:50.158 --> 01:33:52.743
His real name is Sir Evelyn
Anthony Peregrine Scathe,


1542
01:33:52.827 --> 01:33:54.161
so of course
he's called Billy,


1543
01:33:54.246 --> 01:33:56.413
and we're thinking
of getting engaged.


1544
01:33:56.498 --> 01:33:57.665
Anna!

1545
01:33:57.749 --> 01:33:59.166
Well, I haven't even
asked her yet,


1546
01:33:59.251 --> 01:34:00.292
but if she keeps on
committing us,


1547
01:34:00.377 --> 01:34:01.460
I suppose I'll have to.

1548
01:34:01.544 --> 01:34:03.087
We've come for
your blessing, Mummy,


1549
01:34:03.171 --> 01:34:04.255
and we haven't had tea.

1550
01:34:04.339 --> 01:34:07.258
Anna, you quite take
my breath away.


1551
01:34:11.513 --> 01:34:13.514
Darling, you just make
yourself at home in there,


1552
01:34:13.598 --> 01:34:15.140
and we'll help Martha
with the tea.


1553
01:34:15.225 --> 01:34:17.685
- Well, if I'm not wanted.
- Oh.


1554
01:34:17.769 --> 01:34:20.312
We'll sing out
when we want you.


1555
01:34:20.397 --> 01:34:21.814
Come on, Mummy.

1556
01:34:26.027 --> 01:34:27.945
There will be
two more for tea, Martha.


1557
01:34:28.029 --> 01:34:29.029
Martha!

1558
01:34:29.114 --> 01:34:30.364
Miss Anna.

1559
01:34:30.448 --> 01:34:32.366
And you'll find a strange young man
in the living room.


1560
01:34:32.450 --> 01:34:33.409
Who?

1561
01:34:33.493 --> 01:34:35.411
Well, what do you think?

1562
01:34:35.495 --> 01:34:38.205
Gracious. You haven't
given me time to think.


1563
01:34:38.290 --> 01:34:40.416
I gather his name is Sir Evelyn Scathe,

1564
01:34:40.500 --> 01:34:41.792
and you want to marry him.

1565
01:34:41.876 --> 01:34:43.043
Sir Evelyn?

1566
01:34:43.128 --> 01:34:44.712
I met him at a dance in London.

1567
01:34:44.796 --> 01:34:46.046
He's a sublieutenant in the navy.

1568
01:34:46.131 --> 01:34:48.424
You know my weakness for sailormen.

1569
01:34:48.508 --> 01:34:49.883
Well, it's the first
I've heard of it.


1570
01:34:49.968 --> 01:34:51.969
It's a lifelong vice.

1571
01:34:52.053 --> 01:34:53.429
But what do you
want me to say?


1572
01:34:53.513 --> 01:34:55.139
Don't matter what you say.

1573
01:34:55.223 --> 01:34:57.349
She'll have her own way,
same as her mother.


1574
01:34:57.434 --> 01:34:59.184
Don't you go making eyes
at him, now.


1575
01:34:59.311 --> 01:35:02.938
Only a lieutenant?
Captains is more in my line.


1576
01:35:04.524 --> 01:35:06.734
I've never been
so happy in all my life.


1577
01:35:06.818 --> 01:35:08.277
Then I'm happy, too,

1578
01:35:08.820 --> 01:35:10.404
and I shan't waste time
with questions.


1579
01:35:10.488 --> 01:35:13.073
I knew you wouldn't,
and wait till you hear.


1580
01:35:13.158 --> 01:35:14.575
I've discussed it with Bill.

1581
01:35:14.659 --> 01:35:16.660
You're to come and live with us,
you and Martha.


1582
01:35:16.745 --> 01:35:18.162
No, darling.

1583
01:35:18.246 --> 01:35:19.663
But you must.

1584
01:35:19.748 --> 01:35:22.124
You've been alone
so much of your life.


1585
01:35:22.208 --> 01:35:26.670
You're very kind,
but it's hard to explain.


1586
01:35:27.547 --> 01:35:29.673
You can be much more alone
with other people


1587
01:35:29.758 --> 01:35:32.176
than you are by yourself,

1588
01:35:32.260 --> 01:35:34.511
even it's people you love.

1589
01:35:35.513 --> 01:35:37.431
That sounds all mixed-up,
doesn't it?


1590
01:35:37.515 --> 01:35:41.643
No, not a bit, but if you ever
change your mind...


1591
01:35:42.437 --> 01:35:44.521
Get a plate, darling.

1592
01:35:46.191 --> 01:35:48.150
And some extra cups.

1593
01:35:48.818 --> 01:35:50.861
No. I won't change my mind.

1594
01:35:51.529 --> 01:35:54.281
I love this house,
and I've been very happy here,


1595
01:35:54.366 --> 01:35:56.283
and I shall live here till I die.

1596
01:35:56.368 --> 01:35:57.785
With Captain Gregg?

1597
01:35:59.662 --> 01:36:01.080
What did you say?

1598
01:36:01.164 --> 01:36:03.499
With the ghost
of Captain Gregg?


1599
01:36:03.583 --> 01:36:05.584
Anna, what are you
talking about?


1600
01:36:05.668 --> 01:36:07.503
I knew the captain
very well.


1601
01:36:07.587 --> 01:36:08.629
When I was a little girl,

1602
01:36:08.713 --> 01:36:09.880
the first year we lived here,

1603
01:36:09.964 --> 01:36:11.965
we used to have
the most wonderful talks.


1604
01:36:12.050 --> 01:36:13.425
You didn't.

1605
01:36:13.551 --> 01:36:15.636
It was all a game
I made up, of course,


1606
01:36:15.720 --> 01:36:17.346
sort of a dream game,

1607
01:36:17.430 --> 01:36:20.015
but it was a very real
while it lasted,


1608
01:36:20.100 --> 01:36:22.309
and he stopped
coming suddenly.


1609
01:36:22.394 --> 01:36:25.437
I suppose I was growing too old
and sophisticated for him,


1610
01:36:25.522 --> 01:36:27.564
but I grieved and grieved.

1611
01:36:28.983 --> 01:36:31.902
I was hopelessly
in love with him.


1612
01:36:32.487 --> 01:36:35.406
Heavens. You look as if you've seen a...

1613
01:36:36.408 --> 01:36:38.492
Don't tell me you saw him, too.

1614
01:36:38.576 --> 01:36:39.910
No.

1615
01:36:41.663 --> 01:36:43.539
No, not for years.

1616
01:36:43.623 --> 01:36:45.165
Then you did.

1617
01:36:45.250 --> 01:36:48.210
Oh, Mummy, you don't suppose
he really haunted us.


1618
01:36:48.294 --> 01:36:51.422
No, darling.
Things like that can't happen.


1619
01:36:52.424 --> 01:36:54.091
It was only a dream.

1620
01:36:55.552 --> 01:36:58.178
The same dream for both of us?

1621
01:36:58.263 --> 01:37:01.515
Perhaps I set you off
by telling you about my dreams.


1622
01:37:01.599 --> 01:37:03.475
Little girls are
very impressionable.


1623
01:37:03.560 --> 01:37:05.477
I don't remember
your telling me.


1624
01:37:05.562 --> 01:37:08.439
Tell me now.
I'd love to hear about them.


1625
01:37:08.523 --> 01:37:11.483
Well, I can't remember them
very well,


1626
01:37:11.568 --> 01:37:13.652
just bits and pieces,

1627
01:37:13.736 --> 01:37:15.487
a phrase here and there,
a look,


1628
01:37:15.572 --> 01:37:20.117
and I think I dreamed most of my book
<i>Blood and Swash.</i>


1629
01:37:20.201 --> 01:37:21.827
I must have.

1630
01:37:21.911 --> 01:37:25.164
I never could have
thought of it.


1631
01:37:25.623 --> 01:37:30.002
All these years, I...
I've tried to remember,


1632
01:37:30.086 --> 01:37:31.962
but I can't.

1633
01:37:32.046 --> 01:37:34.256
Do you know
what I think?


1634
01:37:34.340 --> 01:37:36.633
I think you
fell in love with him, too.


1635
01:37:36.718 --> 01:37:38.385
I did nothing
of the sort.


1636
01:37:38.470 --> 01:37:40.637
I wouldn't blame you
if you had.


1637
01:37:40.722 --> 01:37:43.140
When did you
stop seeing him?


1638
01:37:43.683 --> 01:37:48.270
After about a year,
I dreamed we quarreled,


1639
01:37:48.354 --> 01:37:50.564
and it was about a man.

1640
01:37:50.648 --> 01:37:52.024
Uncle Neddy.

1641
01:37:52.859 --> 01:37:54.401
Anna, did you know
that Miles and I...


1642
01:37:54.486 --> 01:37:56.778
I used to pray
you wouldn't marry him.


1643
01:37:56.863 --> 01:37:58.906
And you were so right.

1644
01:37:58.990 --> 01:38:02.326
I saw him about five years ago
at a dinner party.


1645
01:38:02.410 --> 01:38:06.663
He was bald and fat.
He drank too much, and then he cried.


1646
01:38:07.248 --> 01:38:11.001
It seems his wife finally had enough
and took the children away.


1647
01:38:12.170 --> 01:38:13.670
You never can tell, can you?

1648
01:38:14.964 --> 01:38:16.256
Once I thought I wanted

1649
01:38:16.341 --> 01:38:18.926
to spend the rest
of my life with him.


1650
01:38:20.553 --> 01:38:24.014
Perhaps he did exist, the captain.

1651
01:38:24.098 --> 01:38:26.767
Perhaps he did come back
and talk to us.


1652
01:38:26.851 --> 01:38:29.436
Wouldn't it be wonderful
if he had?


1653
01:38:29.521 --> 01:38:32.189
Then you'd have something...
You know what I mean,


1654
01:38:32.273 --> 01:38:34.691
to look back on
with happiness.


1655
01:38:35.485 --> 01:38:38.111
No, darling.
He never existed.


1656
01:38:38.196 --> 01:38:40.072
We made him up,
you and I.


1657
01:38:40.740 --> 01:38:43.367
I just wasn't intended to have
that kind of happiness,


1658
01:38:43.451 --> 01:38:45.994
and I haven't missed it,
really I haven't.


1659
01:38:46.079 --> 01:38:48.038
I've been lonely
at times,


1660
01:38:48.122 --> 01:38:51.124
but there have been compensations. You,

1661
01:38:51.209 --> 01:38:55.629
now Bill,
and dear Martha.


1662
01:38:55.713 --> 01:38:58.465
We sit and chatter
like a pair of parrots.


1663
01:39:01.719 --> 01:39:03.387
And this house,

1664
01:39:04.889 --> 01:39:07.307
and the sea
and the gulls,


1665
01:39:09.394 --> 01:39:11.353
and memories,

1666
01:39:13.231 --> 01:39:15.148
I have those, you know.

1667
01:39:15.233 --> 01:39:17.609
Even if it was a dream.

1668
01:39:18.736 --> 01:39:19.778
Now, come along,

1669
01:39:19.862 --> 01:39:29.862
and we'll join your young man
for some tea.


1670
01:40:52.997 --> 01:40:55.248
You, come in here.

1671
01:40:58.878 --> 01:41:01.171
Catch your death.

1672
01:41:02.632 --> 01:41:04.925
What were you
doing out there?


1673
01:41:05.009 --> 01:41:06.635
I don't know.

1674
01:41:06.719 --> 01:41:08.762
You know what
the doctor said.


1675
01:41:08.846 --> 01:41:10.931
Oh, bother the doctor.

1676
01:41:11.015 --> 01:41:12.432
He's an old woman.

1677
01:41:12.517 --> 01:41:15.727
Yeah, and you ain't
a young one anymore.


1678
01:41:16.896 --> 01:41:17.938
Here's a letter from Anna.

1679
01:41:18.022 --> 01:41:19.147
What she say?

1680
01:41:19.232 --> 01:41:22.109
Little Lucy's engaged

1681
01:41:22.193 --> 01:41:25.404
to the captain
of a transatlantic plane.


1682
01:41:25.488 --> 01:41:27.280
Anna's very happy
about it.


1683
01:41:27.365 --> 01:41:29.116
Says it must
run in the family.


1684
01:41:29.200 --> 01:41:31.827
Airplanes, not in my family,
they don't.


1685
01:41:31.911 --> 01:41:34.037
I suppose she means captains.

1686
01:41:37.583 --> 01:41:39.501
Here, drink your hot milk.

1687
01:41:39.585 --> 01:41:42.796
Not now, Martha.
I'm too tired,


1688
01:41:42.880 --> 01:41:45.006
and I have a funny pain
in my arm.


1689
01:41:45.091 --> 01:41:47.134
No wonder,
standing out there in the fog.


1690
01:41:47.218 --> 01:41:48.635
Come on, drink it up.

1691
01:41:48.720 --> 01:41:50.721
Stop bossing me, Martha.

1692
01:41:50.805 --> 01:41:52.472
I don't want
any hot milk.


1693
01:41:52.557 --> 01:41:54.141
Now, now.
Don't get in a state.


1694
01:41:54.225 --> 01:41:58.895
I'm not in a state.
I just want to be left alone.


1695
01:41:58.980 --> 01:42:00.689
Bossing me.

1696
01:42:00.773 --> 01:42:04.985
Very well. The bossing I never intended.

1697
01:42:05.903 --> 01:42:08.947
I only brought the milk
for your own good.


1698
01:42:11.743 --> 01:42:13.243
Bossing me.

1699
01:42:21.669 --> 01:42:23.754
I'm tired.

1700
01:42:51.783 --> 01:42:55.285
And now you'll never
be tired again.


1701
01:42:56.454 --> 01:42:57.829
Come, Lucia.

1702
01:42:58.998 --> 01:43:02.000
Come, my dear.

1703
01:43:45.545 --> 01:43:47.045
Martha.
