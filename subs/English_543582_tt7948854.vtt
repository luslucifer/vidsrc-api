00:00:00.819 --> 00:00:03.736
(cicadas chirping)

2
00:00:19.153 --> 00:00:22.320
(indistinct rumbling)

3
00:00:29.911 --> 00:00:33.661
(dramatic suspenseful music)

4
00:01:12.753 --> 00:01:15.420
(alarm beeping)

5
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.033
- Now why was that so painful?

6
00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.570
Why was that 60 seconds,
the most uncomfortable


7
00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:27.563
part of your day?

8
00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.110
See, I think it's because society tells us

9
00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.550
to avoid silence, and
we're conditioned to think


10
00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:38.250
that something's wrong with quiet.

11
00:01:39.508 --> 00:01:40.350
(laughs)

12
00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.380
I can't tale it anymore,
what's in the bag?


13
00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.213
- You really wanna know?

14
00:01:44.213 --> 00:01:45.630
- [Clayton] Yes.

15
00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.700
- Okay I know it's a little late,

16
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.870
but happy graduation babe.

17
00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.350
- [Clayton] Oh my Gosh,
that looks amazing.


18
00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.523
Did you make this?

19
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.223
- I made the decision to buy it.

20
00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.710
- [Clayton] Okay, just
think about living here,


21
00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.600
would you get lonely?

22
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.840
I mean there are times
where you'd wanna go here


23
00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.540
for a vacation or an escape.

24
00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:12.833
But the idea of living
here, routinely, day-to-day.


25
00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.671
If I'm being honest with myself, I don't--

26
00:02:16.671 --> 00:02:17.760
(banging on door)

27
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.023
Ah that must be Hunter.

28
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.260
Well, patience is his best quality,

29
00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:27.960
so obviously he's a piece of shit.

30
00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.330
- What the fuck!

31
00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:32.810
- [Clayton] Just gonna
let yourself in huh?


32
00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.480
- Yes, and you're welcome
for me being here.


33
00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.320
- [Clayton] What else would you be doing?

34
00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.740
- Getting laid.

35
00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:42.163
- But is too
much silence a bad thing?

36
00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.700
Are the mundane relationships that we keep

37
00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.833
the only things weaving us to sanity?

38
00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.013
- Are you sure that this is okay?

39
00:02:54.013 --> 00:02:57.450
I mean, I know I said
we'd go out to celebrate.


40
00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.800
- [Clayton] What, are you
kidding, look at this.


41
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.183
Okay, this is perfect.

42
00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.143
- Just us, that's okay?

43
00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.468
So are you able to meet
with my cousin next week?


44
00:03:14.468 --> 00:03:16.410
- [Clayton] Um, no.

45
00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:17.540
- Why not?

46
00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.620
There's a position open and
she wants to interview you.


47
00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.852
I mean we could maybe get you
out of your parents house.


48
00:03:22.852 --> 00:03:23.760
(laughs)

49
00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.273
- [Clayton] Um, 
I'm busy next week.

50
00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.503
- The whole week, you're just busy?

51
00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:32.300
- [Clayton] Yeah.

52
00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.100
- Okay mystery man,
what are you busy with?


53
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.410
- [Clayton] Well it's a surprise.

54
00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:40.700
- Like a good surprise?

55
00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.060
- [Clayton] Well I think
it's a good surprise,


56
00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.803
for you it's like a surprise car crash.

57
00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.273
Hey.

58
00:03:51.092 --> 00:03:52.050
(groans)

59
00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:53.723
Yeah, she's a little mad at me.

60
00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:56.770
Hey dad.

61
00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:57.603
- Hi son.

62
00:03:57.603 --> 00:03:59.120
- [Clayton] Hey, can I interview you?

63
00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.751
- Sure what about?

64
00:04:00.751 --> 00:04:05.020
- [Clayton] Um, just like
your job and you know,


65
00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:06.003
your career.

66
00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:09.860
- Yeah, maybe later.

67
00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.390
- Some of the best art
in the world was created


68
00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:17.100
in the darkest hours
of those artists lives.


69
00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.200
And I'm talking about the
whole artistic spectrum okay,


70
00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.240
poets, musicians, film makers, painters,

71
00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.323
novelists, anyone who creates.

72
00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:29.900
The thing is those
artists happily shared it


73
00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.010
because they...

74
00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.790
I don't know, they had too.

75
00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:37.623
Makaila.

76
00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:39.950
Makaila, (groans).

77
00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:42.890
Curt Cobain, Van Gogh, 
Edgar Allen Poe,

78
00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:45.600
they've all found
masterpieces through insanity.


79
00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.730
- Well I mean I think
it's a waste of time,


80
00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:51.760
but then also I think
it's kinda fucking dumb.


81
00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:52.850
- [Clayton] Wow okay.

82
00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:54.090
- I mean clearly, you're going through

83
00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:55.760
a quarter life crisis, so--

84
00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:56.593
- No.
- That's fine.


85
00:04:56.593 --> 00:04:58.020
- [Clayton] Anyways,
back to the interview.


86
00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:59.650
- You've spent the last
three months growing


87
00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:00.680
a depression beard.

88
00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:01.930
- This isn't a depression beard.

89
00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:04.880
- That is a depression
beard and you know it.


90
00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.770
You are three days away from
a straight-up homeless beard.


91
00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:10.890
- Okay cool man, thanks
so much for coming out.


92
00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:12.730
- You know what, 
I'm being a good friend,

93
00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:15.100
and good friends tell the fucking truth.

94
00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.590
- Ernest Hemingway said the terrible mood

95
00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:19.490
of depression, whether
it's any good or not


96
00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:21.323
is known as the artists reward.

97
00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.481
I'll be honest with you, I haven't

98
00:05:25.481 --> 00:05:28.953
taken anything seriously
in a very long time.


99
00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:31.043
It's time I do.

100
00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.920
So the plan, to create loneliness.

101
00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:38.940
Mikaila's gonna drop me off
deep in the Georgia Mountains,


102
00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:42.480
no town whatsoever for 20 miles, no car,

103
00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:44.500
no phone, no GPS.

104
00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:48.320
Just me alone in the
woods with my thoughts


105
00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.270
for five days.

106
00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:52.200
- You know, look at
me man, I did it.

107
00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.010
I did the sell out thing
that you're talking about.


108
00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:56.570
It got me two weeks
paid vacation, benefits,


109
00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:58.190
and I get to pretend
that I'm good at golf

110
00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:59.023
every once in a while.

111
00:05:59.023 --> 00:06:00.480
It's not bad.

112
00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:01.690
- Wow.

113
00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:04.450
No I'm sorry, there's so
much to look forward too


114
00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:05.746
when you put it like that.

115
00:06:05.746 --> 00:06:06.579
- You know what I think
you're fucking problem is,


116
00:06:06.579 --> 00:06:08.110
is that I think you've
seen too many movies


117
00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:10.469
with manic pixie dream girls in 'em, okay.

118
00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:11.363
- What?
- You know


119
00:06:11.363 --> 00:06:12.210
what I'm talking about.

120
00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:13.850
It's just these girls who are just like,

121
00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:16.080
just find your passion, it's
exactly what you sound like.


122
00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:18.210
Okay just find you passion,
and then once you've found


123
00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:20.490
that passion just hug it, okay.

124
00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:25.360
And then that hug will bloom
into happiness and joy,


125
00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.980
and you'll just come back from the dead,

126
00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:28.913
and start just loving life.

127
00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:33.240
- Oh you're done, thank God, you're done.

128
00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:34.445
Okay.

129
00:06:34.445 --> 00:06:35.278
- Manic pixie dream girls aren't real.

130
00:06:35.278 --> 00:06:37.210
- Let's just, let's just do the thing

131
00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:39.780
that I invited you over
here to help me with okay.


132
00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:41.382
Can we just do that?

133
00:06:41.382 --> 00:06:42.763
Please?

134
00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:45.043
Where were we?

135
00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:47.383
- Where were we?

136
00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:51.503
We were at finding your
passion, and hugging it.


137
00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:55.770
- [Makaila] All right so Hunter.

138
00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:57.299
- Yes.

139
00:06:57.299 --> 00:06:59.005
- [Makaila] Tell me about
your best friend Clayton.


140
00:06:59.005 --> 00:07:00.800
(laughs)

141
00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:03.580
- Oh man, he is the clumsiest
person in the world.


142
00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:05.289
- I mean he's
clumsy, but I wouldn't say

143
00:07:05.289 --> 00:07:07.090
he's the clumsiest person in the world.

144
00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:09.953
- No it's true, anyone
clumsier then Clayton is dead.


145
00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:12.730
Let's see, what else?

146
00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:14.527
This is gonna be so good.

147
00:07:14.527 --> 00:07:18.413
I mean he is really smart,
but you can't call him bright.


148
00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:21.970
One time he ate gas station sushi.

149
00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:23.770
- Okay.
- He likes baths better


150
00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:25.370
then showers.
- Okay, I mean things


151
00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:26.720
pertaining to this experiment,

152
00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.380
not weird shit you know about each other.

153
00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:33.160
- In high school he
would make study guides


154
00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.143
at finals time for all the students,

155
00:07:35.143 --> 00:07:38.470
but he would spend so much time making

156
00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:40.270
these study guides to sell them,

157
00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:43.200
that he wouldn't spend any
time actually studying.


158
00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:45.343
And then he would fail himself.

159
00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:48.980
But you know, I mean he'd
always come off with like


160
00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:51.680
1000 bucks or so for Christmas

161
00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.080
or summer break or whatever.

162
00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:59.015
That's just the first
thing that comes to me.


163
00:07:59.015 --> 00:08:01.098
- No that's, that's good.

164
00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:04.320
- Can I just say one more thing?

165
00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:05.730
- Oh my Gosh.

166
00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:07.720
- So what, God you just graduated,

167
00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:09.360
and you don't know what you're
gonna do with your life.


168
00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.110
Welcome to everybody's thought process

169
00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:12.488
that's ever graduated.

170
00:08:12.488 --> 00:08:14.520
You're just scared,
first time in your life,


171
00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:16.820
you don't have everything
planned out for you.


172
00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:22.050
Yes, thank you, it's
finally been said okay.


173
00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:24.650
I think you're fine,
and we can continue now,


174
00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:26.003
but I think you're fine.

175
00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:30.200
- Okay, thank you.
- All right, so what's


176
00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:31.550
the first fucking question?

177
00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:33.470
- Huh.

178
00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:34.460
Um...

179
00:08:38.430 --> 00:08:39.743
I don't know.

180
00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:46.670
There's like a whole foot--

181
00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:47.503
- I know.

182
00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:50.130
- Hunter are you
on a wide enough lens

183
00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:51.310
to capture all of her hatred?

184
00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:52.150
- [Hunter] Got it.

185
00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:54.760
- Oh good, we can continue now.

186
00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:58.037
- [Hunter] All right,
good afternoon Mikaila,


187
00:08:58.037 --> 00:09:02.280
and Clayton, it's the eve
of your solo camping trip.


188
00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:03.430
And how are we feeling this afternoon--

189
00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:05.420
- Stop, take it back.

190
00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:07.300
- [Hunter] How are you feeling?

191
00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:09.940
- Excited, er, a little nervous.

192
00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:11.443
- [Hunter] And what about you Mikaila?

193
00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:17.820
- Annoyed, frustrated,
upset, angry, confused--


194
00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:20.210
- Just, just all of the negative words

195
00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:21.885
in the English language.

196
00:09:21.885 --> 00:09:24.700
(speaking in foreign language)

197
00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:26.350
That's French for something mean.

198
00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:30.030
Hunter, how, how did I describe how she

199
00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:32.239
is treating me the other day?

200
00:09:32.239 --> 00:09:33.725
Can you remember, it was a metaphor.

201
00:09:33.725 --> 00:09:36.285
- No I'd love to hear this metaphor.

202
00:09:36.285 --> 00:09:37.850
- [Hunter] No I wouldn't do it.

203
00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:39.442
- No please,
- Don't, don't.


204
00:09:39.442 --> 00:09:40.275
- I would love to hear it.

205
00:09:40.275 --> 00:09:41.620
- [Hunter] Don't.

206
00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:43.940
- You're treating me
like I am running over


207
00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:47.480
your dog while I'm stabbing
your family to death,


208
00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:50.213
while simultaneously
banging your best friend.


209
00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:54.613
So...

210
00:09:58.020 --> 00:09:59.670
- We can start the interview now.

211
00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:04.510
- [Hunter] Okay, um, why...

212
00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:08.950
Mikaila, why on your best, I
mean to your understanding,


213
00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:13.047
to your best understanding
is he doing this?


214
00:10:13.047 --> 00:10:13.880
- What?

215
00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:18.300
- [Hunter] Like why is his
inspiration to do this, or what?


216
00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:20.490
- Dude you're gonna have to
work on your interviewing voice,


217
00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:22.880
and your dyslexia, like I
straight up wrote the question,


218
00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:24.220
just read it off the card.

219
00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:25.826
- Stop he's helping you.

220
00:10:25.826 --> 00:10:26.842
- [Hunter] Thank you.

221
00:10:26.842 --> 00:10:28.110
- No, no, no, right now it
feels like I'm helping him


222
00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:29.800
by giving him a fucking reading lesson.

223
00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:31.420
- Clayton.
(Hunter laughs)


224
00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:32.820
- [Hunter] No that was good.

225
00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:35.800
- [Mikaila] You mentioned that story

226
00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:37.527
from high school earlier.

227
00:10:37.527 --> 00:10:40.420
- Yeah, yeah, in 10th grade.

228
00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:45.420
Our teacher, she made
us write these plays,


229
00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:47.070
you know these short plays.

230
00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:52.070
And Clayton decides to
write this crazy story


231
00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:56.890
about a mythical land
with this king and queen.


232
00:10:56.890 --> 00:11:00.590
And it's like a bunch of
bullshit, but the queen,


233
00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:03.870
gets kidnapped by the
enemy king of another land.


234
00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:08.643
So the queens name was Syphilis, okay.

235
00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:11.560
So I mean just imagine this,

236
00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:14.590
this class full of immature high schoolers

237
00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:16.770
just on the floor.

238
00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:20.300
The teacher gives him an F, she said,

239
00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:23.553
it was well written, but the
material was inappropriate.


240
00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:28.490
I don't know, I think,
that story really sums up


241
00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:30.230
both sides of Clayton.

242
00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:32.066
- Mikaila, I'm gonna be fine okay,

243
00:11:32.066 --> 00:11:34.400
I mean I'm pretty sure
if Tom Hanks did it

244
00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:37.070
for five years, then I
can do it for five days.


245
00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:38.306
- Tom Hanks?

246
00:11:38.306 --> 00:11:41.410
- Yeah, he did it in Castaway.

247
00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:43.990
- That's a movie, 
Tom Hanks isn't real.

248
00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:45.870
- No Tom Hanks is definitely real.

249
00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:49.240
- Okay, it's not

250
00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:51.810
you just going out into
the woods that bothers me,


251
00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:53.630
what bothers me is the fact that you're

252
00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:57.610
disconnecting from literally everything.

253
00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:02.190
No car, no phone, I mean
what if you get hurt?


254
00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:05.320
What if you get attacked by
a bear or someone robs you--


255
00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:08.160
- No, no, no,
none of that's gonna happen!

256
00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:11.740
I'm gonna feel alone, that's it.

257
00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:14.770
I'm gonna learn things
about myself in the process.


258
00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:17.463
I'm gonna come back with a great story.

259
00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:20.073
That...

260
00:12:23.270 --> 00:12:24.103
That's it.

261
00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:28.163
Mikaila, Mikaila.

262
00:12:34.205 --> 00:12:35.622
That was awkward.

263
00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:38.990
What are you gonna
do side with her now?

264
00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:46.633
So this is it, last
thoughts before I head up.


265
00:12:51.202 --> 00:12:53.933
I'm a little nervous
but this is my chance.


266
00:12:56.600 --> 00:13:00.730
This is my chance to
harness some sort of storm,


267
00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:02.323
and once evolved, share it.

268
00:13:03.421 --> 00:13:06.338
(clippers buzzing)

269
00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:15.153
So wish me luck.

270
00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:30.480
And we're headed up to the mountains.

271
00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:32.310
Mikaila's syked, you can tell by the vein

272
00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:34.510
in her forehead how excited she is.

273
00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:36.378
- Clayton it's way too early.

274
00:13:36.378 --> 00:13:39.770
- I want, I want you to
look into this camera


275
00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:41.660
and say one positive thing.

276
00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:42.680
It can be anything.

277
00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:46.740
Hey it's pretty cool that
the sun rose this morning.


278
00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:50.140
It's awesome that we're
both currently not on fire,


279
00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:51.600
'cause that would suck.

280
00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:53.300
- You know I could just turn around.

281
00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:56.700
- No, no, that's, we're good.

282
00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:58.643
I just want it to be said
though, ahead of time,


283
00:13:58.643 --> 00:14:00.260
that I'm gonna come back with this

284
00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.360
dissertation on life.

285
00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:04.210
You know, this life dissertation.

286
00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:06.160
And you're gonna apologize.

287
00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:09.420
Prediction submitted, there it is.

288
00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:12.070
- Can we please just not
talk about the trip anymore.


289
00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:18.260
- I'm sure Christopher
Columbus' girlfriend


290
00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:21.230
wasn't happy whenever he
went on the boat to America.


291
00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:22.523
- Yeah that's the same.

292
00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:27.620
- She was literally like
"You're gonna fall off Earth."


293
00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:29.370
She probably wasn't as mean to him.

294
00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:32.670
You win, turn the car around,

295
00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:35.580
I'll find a different means
for creative inspiration


296
00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:39.430
involving black tar
heroine and alley syringes.


297
00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:40.513
- Oh my God, Clayton.

301
00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:04.583
I fucking love that show,
I watch it every day.


302
00:15:11.906 --> 00:15:15.186
- This is so ridiculous,
what are we doing?


303
00:15:15.186 --> 00:15:17.410
Look at him, not a
care in the damn world.

304
00:15:17.410 --> 00:15:19.860
- Hey let's play a game
called what decade is it?


305
00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:23.813
Excuse me ma'am where's the
nearest roller blade store?


306
00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:33.860
The fact that you one day woke up

307
00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:37.010
without a sense of humor kinda bothers me.

308
00:15:37.010 --> 00:15:40.140
- Well you know, actually, 
I'm storing up

309
00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:42.490
every stupid thing you say in my head

310
00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:44.590
so I can laugh at it later.

311
00:15:44.590 --> 00:15:47.463
You know, just so I won't
give you the satisfaction.


312
00:15:47.463 --> 00:15:52.463
- Oh, that's the best news
I've heard in a long time.


313
00:15:53.245 --> 00:15:55.440
- Yeah well I'm a sick person.

314
00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:57.442
(Clayton laughs)

315
00:15:57.442 --> 00:16:00.030
Can you just put that camera down?

316
00:16:00.030 --> 00:16:00.863
Let's just talk.

317
00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:02.720
- [Clayton] Yeah.

318
00:16:04.722 --> 00:16:06.700
But did you, did you ever play?

319
00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:09.400
- [Mikaila] Um, 
I played T Ball but I got

320
00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:10.580
kicked off the team.

321
00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:12.710
- [Clayton] You got kicked
off your T Ball team?


322
00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:14.146
- [Mikaila] Yes.

323
00:16:14.146 --> 00:16:16.240
- [Clayton] T Ball like when you're five?

324
00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:17.710
- [Mikaila] Yes, it's not funny.

325
00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:19.600
- Give me 1000 years of guesses,

326
00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:20.740
I'd have no idea.

327
00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:22.450
Like how does somebody
get kicked off their T--


328
00:16:22.450 --> 00:16:24.560
- Okay, all right, I'll explain.

329
00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:27.070
So every week the
teammates would take turns


330
00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:28.780
bringing snacks for after the game.

331
00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:30.410
- Uh huh.
- And when it was my week


332
00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:32.720
my mom made these boss
chocolate and peanut butter


333
00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:35.370
cupcakes, anyways there's this one girl

334
00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:38.580
who never threw me the ball,
was always kinda rude to me,


335
00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:41.245
and she refused to eat my moms cupcakes.

336
00:16:41.245 --> 00:16:42.078
(Clayton laughs)

337
00:16:42.078 --> 00:16:42.920
Which is unacceptable.

338
00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:45.580
So I got sick of it one day,

339
00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:47.500
and smashed a cupcake in her face.

340
00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:50.583
And er, then she went to the hospital.

341
00:16:50.583 --> 00:16:51.930
- [Clayton] What?

342
00:16:51.930 --> 00:16:56.023
- Turns out she was severely
allergic to peanuts.


343
00:16:56.023 --> 00:16:57.230
(Clayton laughs)

344
00:16:57.230 --> 00:17:00.000
So er, yeah that traumatizing event

345
00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.180
ended my baseball career.

346
00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:04.150
- [Clayton] Why did
you never tell me that?


347
00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:07.010
- Well I tend to skip
stories where I almost kill


348
00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:08.503
a five-year-old child.

349
00:17:08.503 --> 00:17:10.586
(laughs)

350
00:17:11.522 --> 00:17:13.043
So what is this place exactly?

351
00:17:14.310 --> 00:17:16.700
- Er, I don't know
just some patch of land

352
00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:18.380
between two mountains.

353
00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:20.463
Nothing's there though, that's all I know.

354
00:17:22.786 --> 00:17:25.953

364
00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:25.383
- You sure?

365
00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:28.080
- Yeah, better place then any.

366
00:18:36.029 --> 00:18:38.779
(car door slams)

367
00:18:40.711 --> 00:18:43.378
(Mikaila sighs)

368
00:19:01.309 --> 00:19:05.142
(muffled speaking off camera)

369
00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:12.967
- Wow, we really are out
in the middle of nowhere.


370
00:19:12.967 --> 00:19:14.690
- Good.

371
00:19:14.690 --> 00:19:17.563
- I hope I remember
how to get back here.

372
00:19:18.505 --> 00:19:19.600
- No that's not funny, okay.

373
00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:21.290
You use your phone
and you drop a pin.

374
00:19:21.290 --> 00:19:23.440
- Baby you know I lose
things all the time.


375
00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:26.500
- Wow, no it didn't get
any funnier that time.


376
00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:28.164
- Well you know, what if I die,

377
00:19:28.164 --> 00:19:30.990
and no one's here to
come get you in six days.


378
00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:34.620
An 18-wheeler just runs
me off the road and bam,


379
00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:35.683
no more Mikaila.

380
00:19:36.914 --> 00:19:37.903
No one to come get you.

381
00:19:40.790 --> 00:19:42.140
- Well that was dark.

382
00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:44.471
- Yeah, and you know I
actually didn't even need


383
00:19:44.471 --> 00:19:45.450
a little camping trip for that one,

384
00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:46.773
it just sorta came to me.

385
00:19:48.670 --> 00:19:49.503
- Well played.

386
00:19:51.810 --> 00:19:55.333
Hey, I'm gonna meet with
your cousin when I get back.


387
00:19:57.470 --> 00:20:00.820
- Look I know you don't
wanna be a corporate blogger.


388
00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:02.843
- Yeah but I
still wanna meet with her.

389
00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:06.553
- Well I mean
there's no harm in trying.

390
00:20:07.887 --> 00:20:08.720
- Yeah, exactly.

391
00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:14.640
- Look I'm sorry, 
I've seemed like

392
00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:16.070
such a bitch lately.

393
00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:20.760
It's just, you know it's
because I love you right?


394
00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:22.143
- Of course, yeah.

395
00:20:45.930 --> 00:20:47.580
- Shit.
- What?


396
00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:50.913
- A tree is down, 
I guess this'll do.

397
00:20:59.031 --> 00:20:59.864
Here.

398
00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:05.890
I'll lead you in.

399
00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:12.793
- [Clayton] Mikaila?

400
00:21:16.270 --> 00:21:17.893
- [Mikaila] Okay, turn this way.

401
00:21:20.871 --> 00:21:22.114
- [Clayton] You're not
gonna kill me are ya?


402
00:21:22.114 --> 00:21:22.947
(Mikaila chuckles)

403
00:21:22.947 --> 00:21:26.090
- [Mikaila] No.

404
00:21:26.090 --> 00:21:28.083
- [Clayton] Here, hang
on, let me get this up.


405
00:21:32.011 --> 00:21:32.844
All right.

406
00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:38.750
Okay, I'm gonna be fine,
what, what will fix this?


407
00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:39.600
- Nothing.
- No.


408
00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:44.293
Don't say nothing, okay,
what will fix this?


409
00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:46.533
- [Mikaila] It's not like that.

410
00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:50.660
- [Clayton] When I am done
with this whole project okay,


411
00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:53.840
I, I will spend time in church.

412
00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:54.673
I will watch "Full House."

413
00:21:54.673 --> 00:21:55.760
- [Mikaila] Okay stop, stop.

414
00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:57.940
I don't need your sarcasm right now okay.

415
00:21:57.940 --> 00:22:00.533
Just, just let me feel how I feel.

416
00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:04.960
- Okay.
- Okay,


417
00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:07.280
I just want you to
be real for a moment.

418
00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:08.430
- [Clayton] About what?

419
00:22:12.913 --> 00:22:14.331
- [Mikaila] What do you want?

420
00:22:14.331 --> 00:22:17.660
Okay, what do you want out of this?

421
00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:19.373
- [Clayton] I want us.

422
00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:23.970
- [Mikaila] You're gonna
have to explain that to me.


423
00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:25.410
- [Clayton] I just
said it, I want us.

424
00:22:25.410 --> 00:22:29.400
Look I'm not even using the
misogynist answer of you,


425
00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:30.934
I want us.

426
00:22:30.934 --> 00:22:32.330
- [Mikaila] That doesn't
even make sense okay


427
00:22:32.330 --> 00:22:37.033
because as far as I'm
concerned, you have us.


428
00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:40.787
So, I wanna know what you actually mean

429
00:22:40.787 --> 00:22:42.900
when you say you want us.

430
00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:46.500
- It means I want us okay.

431
00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:49.840
I am not willing to give you
some dispassionate version


432
00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:52.490
of that person okay, some detached guy

433
00:22:52.490 --> 00:22:54.510
who gave up on every single dream

434
00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:55.540
straight out of the gate.

435
00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:57.360
I'm not gonna do that.

436
00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:59.063
You deserve better.

437
00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:03.451
- [Mikaila] Give me the camera.

438
00:23:03.451 --> 00:23:04.284
Give me the camera!

439
00:23:04.284 --> 00:23:05.950
- What, why?
- Give me the camera!


440
00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:16.830
Okay, Clayton I'm gonna ask you,

441
00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:20.190
one more time, all right.

442
00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:21.410
What do you want?

443
00:23:21.410 --> 00:23:24.240
What is the driving force behind this?

444
00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:27.190
What is bothering you so
much that you feel like


445
00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:28.770
you have to do this okay?

446
00:23:28.770 --> 00:23:29.693
Just say it.

447
00:23:36.050 --> 00:23:37.873
- My dad feels stuck at his job.

448
00:23:39.850 --> 00:23:42.487
He doesn't say it, but
he doesn't have too.


449
00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:46.753
I'm not gonna be that way.

450
00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:48.583
- [Mikaila] You love your dad,

451
00:23:48.583 --> 00:23:49.890
don't talk shit about him okay.

452
00:23:49.890 --> 00:23:51.953
- [Clayton] I love him,
I don't respect him,


453
00:23:51.953 --> 00:23:52.910
there's a difference.

454
00:23:52.910 --> 00:23:55.650
- [Mikaila] Your father
works a job he hates


455
00:23:55.650 --> 00:23:57.020
so he can provide for his family.

456
00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:59.083
How is he not a fucking superhero?

457
00:24:02.193 --> 00:24:04.113
- You just, you don't understand.

458
00:24:06.870 --> 00:24:09.020
- [Mikaila] So what
are you gonna do now?

459
00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:10.900
- I've already told you, I'm here,

460
00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:12.230
you've seen this thing.

461
00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:14.190
I'm going to write a story.

462
00:24:14.190 --> 00:24:16.160
I'm gonna make a novel,
I'm gonna write it,


463
00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:17.420
I'm gonna make you proud.

464
00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:19.133
You are going to be proud of me.

465
00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:22.253
- [Mikaila] I am proud.

466
00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:32.059
(Mikaila sighs)

467
00:24:32.059 --> 00:24:32.892
Okay.

468
00:24:35.821 --> 00:24:37.571
- Give me the camera.

469
00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:44.590
- [Mikaila] Look, I know
how you're feeling Clayton.


470
00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:48.150
All right, you want, you wanna be great.

471
00:24:48.150 --> 00:24:49.043
Everyone does.

472
00:24:49.879 --> 00:24:50.882
- Put the camera down.

473
00:24:50.882 --> 00:24:51.863
- [Mikaila] No, no!

474
00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.120
You wanna be great okay,

475
00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:56.420
you're gonna listen to me.

476
00:25:01.010 --> 00:25:02.820
You see people post things online

477
00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:09.282
and you think they're happy,
but they're only posting


478
00:25:09.282 --> 00:25:10.843
the highlight reels.

479
00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:16.753
But you look at them, and you
think you're not good enough.


480
00:25:17.959 --> 00:25:18.900
- Put it down.

481
00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:20.240
- [Mikaila] You are.

482
00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:21.333
You are good enough.

483
00:25:28.090 --> 00:25:29.090
Watch this in a couple of days

484
00:25:29.090 --> 00:25:30.803
and see if you believe yourself.

485
00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:38.800
- Come here.
- Come here.


486
00:25:46.637 --> 00:25:50.525
- I love you.
- I love you too.


487
00:25:50.525 --> 00:25:51.560
- [Clayton] I love you more then

488
00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:54.213
the nostalgic memory
of a Blockbuster Video.


489
00:25:55.197 --> 00:25:56.779
- [Mikaila] I love you
more then peanut butter


490
00:25:56.779 --> 00:25:57.612
and chocolate.

491
00:25:57.612 --> 00:25:59.347
- [Clayton] That's impossible,
don't say something


492
00:25:59.347 --> 00:26:00.620
you can't take back.

493
00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:01.983
- [Mikaila] It's true, I do, I do.

494
00:26:08.381 --> 00:26:10.100
- Goodbye.
- Bye.


495
00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:11.850
- I'll see you
in a couple of days.

496
00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:48.793
Mikaila!

497
00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:52.943
So this is it.

498
00:26:56.210 --> 00:26:58.313
This is where I'll find myself.

499
00:27:00.539 --> 00:27:04.390
I spent all my graduation
money buying a camera,


500
00:27:04.390 --> 00:27:06.343
batteries and cards.

501
00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:10.343
I'm a fucking idiot.

502
00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:16.813
First night, it's not so bad out here.

503
00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:20.790
Just quiet.

504
00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:22.903
Besides the cicadas it's quiet.

505
00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:28.680
I can actually hear myself think,

506
00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:30.533
don't love it, but I can.

507
00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:36.943
It's definitely creepy out here,

508
00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:40.833
but I have to ask the question,

509
00:27:43.870 --> 00:27:48.870
would having someone with me
make it any less dangerous?


510
00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:55.440
And the answer is no,
but it takes being alone


511
00:27:56.550 --> 00:27:59.203
to realize you#'re afraid.

512
00:28:07.710 --> 00:28:08.543
Hello!

513
00:28:10.910 --> 00:28:12.093
Is anyone there?

514
00:28:15.250 --> 00:28:17.657
So, I survived the first night,

515
00:28:17.657 --> 00:28:19.463
er, I just ate breakfast,

516
00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:24.300
a granola bar which will also be dinner.

517
00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:27.590
Let me say one thing, this
is not the body of a man


518
00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:29.560
who eats two granola bars a day.

519
00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:33.363
This is the body of a man who
eats a granola bar as a snack.


520
00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:37.903
So, thoughts on last night.

521
00:28:39.623 --> 00:28:41.390
Er, one thing that comes to mind,

522
00:28:41.390 --> 00:28:43.493
one word would be aware.

523
00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:50.753
I was aware of every
sound that was around me.


524
00:28:51.690 --> 00:28:53.553
The trees blowing in the wind,

525
00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:57.470
the leaves skipping on the ground.

526
00:28:57.470 --> 00:29:02.470
Everything was so crisp,
honestly it was amazing.


527
00:29:08.274 --> 00:29:10.274
Well I am bored as shit.

528
00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:12.963
Look what I found.

529
00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:17.400
Bottom of the 7th, two outs, two strikes,

530
00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:19.613
no balls, men on 2nd and 3rd.

531
00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:22.340
And the pitch.

532
00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:27.000
Oh it's hit a mile high,
and three miles long.


533
00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.780
Yes it could go all the way.

534
00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:33.220
Upper decker, home run, and that pitch

535
00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:35.250
will sink Clayton into a month long binge

536
00:29:35.250 --> 00:29:38.933
of depression, alcoholism
and self-loathing.


537
00:29:41.101 --> 00:29:43.282
♪ Lumber jacking in the forest ♪

538
00:29:43.282 --> 00:29:46.040
(Ax smashes)

539
00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:47.973
That is not happening.

540
00:29:49.703 --> 00:29:51.880
(groans)

541
00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:52.713
Come on.

542
00:29:57.638 --> 00:30:00.305
(logs snapping)

543
00:30:09.979 --> 00:30:10.812
Huh.

544
00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:17.570
That is a creepy tree.

545
00:30:17.570 --> 00:30:21.000
These trees are monotonous.

546
00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:22.300
Be hell to get lost in it.

547
00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:27.330
I don't know, it's somehow
not as scary in the daytime.


548
00:30:28.781 --> 00:30:30.100
It reminds me of whenever
I was a little kid


549
00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:32.643
and I just ran out into the forest.

550
00:30:34.170 --> 00:30:36.180
Making up stories along the way,

551
00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:38.003
living my own little journey.

552
00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:43.093
Oftentimes being chased by something.

553
00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:49.190
A ninja, like all the time
actually, I don't know,


554
00:30:49.190 --> 00:30:50.573
what the hell that's about.

555
00:30:58.983 --> 00:31:01.233
I can make that jump right?

556
00:31:05.063 --> 00:31:06.146
You got this.

557
00:31:08.882 --> 00:31:12.199
(groans)
(water splashing)


558
00:31:12.199 --> 00:31:13.782
Ugh, it's so gross.

559
00:31:16.541 --> 00:31:18.874
What the hell water is that?

560
00:31:21.463 --> 00:31:23.380
Geeze, it's disgusting.

561
00:31:26.759 --> 00:31:28.842
(groans)

562
00:31:30.410 --> 00:31:32.803
Night's coming, soon enough.

563
00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:39.970
If you guys could smell me right now.

564
00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:42.370
There are no words.

565
00:31:42.370 --> 00:31:44.590
I used to be
like bullshit, there's a word

566
00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:45.530
for everything.

567
00:31:45.530 --> 00:31:47.723
Nope, not this smell.

568
00:31:49.510 --> 00:31:53.900
Smells like two dead
animals crawled inside of


569
00:31:55.430 --> 00:31:58.893
three dead animals just
to shit, and then die.


570
00:32:00.350 --> 00:32:04.700
It's night two, it's late, real late.

571
00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:08.890
Heard a lot of noises tonight,

572
00:32:08.890 --> 00:32:12.243
it's the longest I've ever
gone without seeing someone.


573
00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:17.430
I mean sure I've had those
days where I disappear


574
00:32:17.430 --> 00:32:20.090
into a sofa and binge
watch 12 hours of TV

575
00:32:20.090 --> 00:32:21.673
while screening all my calls.

576
00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:27.610
I call those dark days,
but I also call them


577
00:32:27.610 --> 00:32:29.440
everything I've ever wanted days.

578
00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:32.850
So new observation, there's a fine line

579
00:32:32.850 --> 00:32:34.400
between delight and depression.

580
00:32:39.270 --> 00:32:42.183
I don't know though,
this is just different.


581
00:32:46.594 --> 00:32:49.874
(distant banging)

582
00:32:49.874 --> 00:32:51.207
Nothing's there.

583
00:32:52.135 --> 00:32:53.468
Nothing's there.

584
00:32:55.095 --> 00:32:57.095
(sighs)

585
00:33:09.855 --> 00:33:13.022
(phone ringing)
Fuck!


586
00:33:29.350 --> 00:33:30.183
Hello.

587
00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:34.780
Are you kidding me Mikaila?

588
00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:36.310
Are you kidding me?

589
00:33:36.310 --> 00:33:39.150
No, no this is not
cool, this is not cool.

590
00:33:39.150 --> 00:33:41.403
Yes I'm fine, you have to quit worrying.

591
00:33:42.450 --> 00:33:43.820
What, when, when?

592
00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:46.240
No I will not calm down okay.

593
00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:47.940
Okay, I will not calm down.

594
00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:51.460
No, do not assume the worst
whenever you call back okay,


595
00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:54.853
because this phone is gonna
be in pieces on the dirt.


596
00:33:54.853 --> 00:33:57.110
(phone slams)

597
00:33:57.110 --> 00:33:58.633
My heartbeat hasn't slowed.

598
00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:05.230
So Mikaila snuck in a
burner phone into my bag


599
00:34:05.460 --> 00:34:06.813
whenever I was gassing up.

600
00:34:08.740 --> 00:34:11.313
She also left this,

601
00:34:13.010 --> 00:34:15.310
some sort of memory card
or something to play.


602
00:34:17.010 --> 00:34:18.733
Anyway, cheap scare of the night.

603
00:34:19.650 --> 00:34:20.483
Moving on.

604
00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:25.323
I keep hearing those noises though.

605
00:34:27.930 --> 00:34:29.413
Sounds like footsteps.

606
00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:35.983
I have this theory about pushing
the limit of sleeplessness.


607
00:34:37.450 --> 00:34:39.990
It goes like this, when
you stay awake longer


608
00:34:39.990 --> 00:34:43.460
then you're used too,
your brain being such


609
00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:47.133
a powerful and mysterious
thing that it is,


610
00:34:48.050 --> 00:34:51.460
it becomes aware that you're tired.

611
00:34:51.460 --> 00:34:54.012
And the brain being the powerful,

612
00:34:54.012 --> 00:34:56.823
and mysterious thing that it is,

613
00:34:58.040 --> 00:34:59.353
it compensates.

614
00:35:00.810 --> 00:35:04.200
What I've found is it overcompensates,

615
00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:09.200
creating some sort of a
heightened creative state.


616
00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:11.380
So I might just
stay up writing all night.

617
00:35:16.530 --> 00:35:17.363
Well I, (sighs).

618
00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:21.603
I won't bore you with this.

619
00:35:29.780 --> 00:35:30.613
Hello!

620
00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.523
Hello, is anyone there?

621
00:35:42.935 --> 00:35:46.095
(twig snapping)
(leaves rustling)


622
00:35:46.095 --> 00:35:46.928
Fuck!

623
00:35:50.156 --> 00:35:52.943
Fuck, fuck.
(breathing heavily)


624
00:36:08.590 --> 00:36:13.523
I know it was an animal,
I just didn't see it.


625
00:36:16.060 --> 00:36:17.910
It was big, it was...

626
00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:27.190
You always feel like you're
being followed in the woods,


627
00:36:28.310 --> 00:36:29.143
you never are.

628
00:36:31.394 --> 00:36:32.994
It's just paranoia in the night.

629
00:37:10.351 --> 00:37:12.351
(sighs)

630
00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:15.113
Nothing's been touched.

631
00:37:19.530 --> 00:37:21.973
A couple of weeks
ago I had a dream,

632
00:37:23.530 --> 00:37:26.160
and in this dream I was
writing a short story


633
00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:28.940
about this character that was going crazy

634
00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:32.710
because of this dark, shadowy entity

635
00:37:32.710 --> 00:37:34.610
that wouldn't leave him alone.

636
00:37:34.610 --> 00:37:36.950
And I'm laying on
my stomach on the sofa,

637
00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:39.623
typing on my laptop,
and then I fell asleep.


638
00:37:43.570 --> 00:37:44.970
And that's when it happened.

639
00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:52.880
I woke up to something slowly pulling me,

640
00:37:53.610 --> 00:37:58.350
and the second that I
became aware of what it was,


641
00:37:58.350 --> 00:38:00.733
it yanked me off the sofa.

642
00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:04.830
And I flew upright, and I was levitating,

643
00:38:04.830 --> 00:38:09.203
my feet were off the
ground, and I was frozen.


644
00:38:11.620 --> 00:38:15.060
And I tried to scream,
but the second I tried


645
00:38:16.050 --> 00:38:19.803
the most unbelievably tight
grip came around my throat.


646
00:38:22.050 --> 00:38:23.663
And it all went blurry.

647
00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:25.963
And then I woke up.

648
00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:33.443
I woke up in the exact same
place I had fallen asleep.


649
00:38:37.380 --> 00:38:39.850
If immersing myself in
this terrifying world


650
00:38:39.850 --> 00:38:43.420
can effect me that much,
down deep there is a story


651
00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:44.603
waiting to be found.

652
00:38:45.510 --> 00:38:47.293
Kinda scared to fall asleep now.

653
00:38:49.103 --> 00:38:51.023
I was hoping you could
keep my company though.


654
00:38:55.354 --> 00:38:56.370
What was it?

655
00:38:56.370 --> 00:38:59.813
My mom used to quote this
verse from Joshua something.


656
00:39:02.327 --> 00:39:03.907
"Be strong and courageous.

657
00:39:03.907 --> 00:39:06.887
"Do not be frightened, do not be dismayed,

658
00:39:06.887 --> 00:39:08.447
"for the Lord, your God is with you,

659
00:39:08.447 --> 00:39:09.517
"wherever you go."

660
00:39:16.281 --> 00:39:20.531
Everything's gonna be fine,
I know that, I know it.


661
00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:24.400
Everything's fine.

662
00:39:29.890 --> 00:39:31.698
My uncle, he used to say that,

663
00:39:31.698 --> 00:39:34.097
"If you live close enough to people

664
00:39:34.097 --> 00:39:36.777
"where you can't scream
at the end of a bad day


665
00:39:36.777 --> 00:39:39.397
"without getting in trouble then you live

666
00:39:39.397 --> 00:39:40.897
"too close to people."

667
00:39:45.450 --> 00:39:47.193
My uncle was a fucking liar.

668
00:40:03.530 --> 00:40:08.530
So, the sun is offensively
bright in the morning,


669
00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:14.183
it's like a big
old fuck you from nature.

670
00:40:18.340 --> 00:40:21.193
But I survived night two.

671
00:40:24.830 --> 00:40:27.050
Yay.

672
00:40:27.050 --> 00:40:29.230
Being out here I've
really gotten to recall


673
00:40:29.230 --> 00:40:31.880
some memories I'm pretty
sure I would have forgotten.


674
00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:36.860
Once again it comes back to this idea

675
00:40:36.860 --> 00:40:39.560
that I can't shake, that
we're just surrounded


676
00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:41.970
by so much noise, and
we don't get the time


677
00:40:41.970 --> 00:40:45.003
to even exercise these great memories.

678
00:40:48.380 --> 00:40:50.640
Anyway, the last couple
hours I've been thinking


679
00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:53.443
about some of the funniest
stories of my life.


680
00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:00.903
Kinda makes me wish I had journaled more.

681
00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:04.853
I've had too good
of a life not too.

682
00:41:07.550 --> 00:41:09.115
One story though,

683
00:41:09.115 --> 00:41:12.460
um it was the first camping trip

684
00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:14.900
that we had ever taken, we went camping,

685
00:41:14.900 --> 00:41:17.513
we went on this drunk
hike through the forest.


686
00:41:18.735 --> 00:41:21.310
And we ended up on this gravel road,

687
00:41:21.310 --> 00:41:24.930
not a car, not a sound for miles.

688
00:41:24.930 --> 00:41:27.740
And then all of a sudden, 
Hunter said it,

689
00:41:27.740 --> 00:41:29.107
he said "Guys, guys, turn off your lights,

690
00:41:29.107 --> 00:41:30.716
"turn off your lights."

691
00:41:30.716 --> 00:41:32.740
So we did, we all ducked
down on the gravel road,


692
00:41:32.740 --> 00:41:34.003
we were scared.

693
00:41:36.313 --> 00:41:37.860
And we said "What's up, what's going on?"

694
00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:41.453
He said, "This is life.

695
00:41:42.757 --> 00:41:46.213
"Dark, unsure, uncertain,

696
00:41:47.197 --> 00:41:50.863
"and you can sit here
and not become a man,


697
00:41:51.867 --> 00:41:53.717
"or you can walk towards it."

698
00:41:55.174 --> 00:41:58.940
And we all said, "Hunter you've
probably drank too much."


699
00:41:58.940 --> 00:42:02.397
But he stood up,
and he said "No, no,

700
00:42:02.397 --> 00:42:05.187
"I am seriously, be seriously,

701
00:42:05.187 --> 00:42:07.177
"I am seriously right now."

702
00:42:09.570 --> 00:42:12.287
He said, "This is how
I wanna live my life.


703
00:42:12.287 --> 00:42:15.130
"I wanna sprint towards life."

704
00:42:15.130 --> 00:42:19.577
And so he said, "You assholes
keep off your flashlights."


705
00:42:20.655 --> 00:42:24.133
And then he sprinted.

706
00:42:25.070 --> 00:42:27.073
He sprinted as fast as he could,

707
00:42:28.970 --> 00:42:30.033
for a long time.

708
00:42:31.780 --> 00:42:33.803
And then we hear it.

709
00:42:35.140 --> 00:42:37.012
Thud, "Ah shit."

710
00:42:37.012 --> 00:42:39.890
(laughs)

711
00:42:39.890 --> 00:42:43.140
He had ran directly off
the road and into a tree,


712
00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:46.803
and then fell into
a giant pile of thorns.

713
00:42:48.370 --> 00:42:51.360
And the whole time we
were walking him back


714
00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:55.280
he just kept saying
"That's life, that's life.


715
00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:56.527
"Life is hard."

716
00:42:59.310 --> 00:43:02.303
I know I'm telling that story
to nobody right now, but,


717
00:43:04.713 --> 00:43:06.743
any excuse to tell it.

718
00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:14.650
So I just got back to the campsite

719
00:43:14.650 --> 00:43:18.063
and something got into my food.

720
00:43:19.710 --> 00:43:23.450
On top of that, there
is a hole in the bottom


721
00:43:23.450 --> 00:43:25.093
of my water jug.

722
00:43:26.690 --> 00:43:29.183
So that's where we're at.

723
00:43:36.111 --> 00:43:37.890
(sighs)

724
00:43:37.890 --> 00:43:41.423
Hey friends, I found the
story I wanna write about.


725
00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:45.863
It involves a protagonist
who's a little bit lonely.


726
00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:52.300
I don't know, I've always been taught

727
00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:53.563
you write what you feel.

728
00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:58.840
You write what you feel,
or you write something


729
00:43:58.840 --> 00:44:00.293
that doesn't mean anything.

730
00:44:04.140 --> 00:44:07.330
And I think honestly,
if I can somehow isolate


731
00:44:07.330 --> 00:44:09.983
fear with my protagonist,

732
00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:16.053
I think I'll have the
story I'm looking for.


733
00:44:18.710 --> 00:44:23.710
A character with only his
own thoughts to believe in,


734
00:44:24.780 --> 00:44:26.180
that's what I'm looking for.

735
00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:34.673
Fuck, I've never been able to
get inspired in the daytime.


736
00:44:35.660 --> 00:44:38.803
I always get sidetracked and watch TV.

737
00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:43.053
Well I think that fits my
theory about creativity.


738
00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:52.500
It'll come at night, so until then,

739
00:44:53.693 --> 00:44:55.360
I'll just wait.

740
00:44:59.247 --> 00:45:02.080
(distant banging)

741
00:45:09.049 --> 00:45:10.466
I have to see it.

742
00:45:31.289 --> 00:45:33.631
(distant banging)
(gasps)


743
00:45:33.631 --> 00:45:34.548
What is it?

744
00:45:38.169 --> 00:45:41.169
(breathing heavily)

745
00:45:46.831 --> 00:45:50.581
(distant banging)
What is...


746
00:46:02.683 --> 00:46:07.683
(creature growls)
(Clayton yells)


747
00:46:17.769 --> 00:46:18.773
It's the third night,

748
00:46:19.900 --> 00:46:23.413
heard footsteps since about nine o'clock.

749
00:46:25.270 --> 00:46:26.320
They haven't stopped.

750
00:46:31.668 --> 00:46:32.835
I can't leave.

751
00:46:35.890 --> 00:46:37.623
This has to be some sick joke.

752
00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:42.210
At this point I'm just,

753
00:46:42.210 --> 00:46:45.730
I'm, I'm talking just to not hear silence.

754
00:46:45.730 --> 00:46:49.900
Disregard any and all
bullshit I speak about okay.


755
00:46:49.900 --> 00:46:52.700
I might tell a story,
I might create a story,


756
00:46:52.700 --> 00:46:54.770
I might sing a fucking nursery rhyme.

757
00:46:54.770 --> 00:46:57.640
I don't, I don't know,
I might talk even though


758
00:46:57.640 --> 00:46:59.490
I don't know what I'm fucking saying.

759
00:47:00.710 --> 00:47:05.710
I know my sensitivity to
noise is heightened out here,


760
00:47:08.457 --> 00:47:09.557
but I heard something.

761
00:47:17.100 --> 00:47:17.933
Hello!

762
00:47:21.090 --> 00:47:22.193
Is anyone there?

763
00:47:31.122 --> 00:47:32.544
(creature growling)

764
00:47:32.544 --> 00:47:33.377
Stop it!

765
00:47:36.144 --> 00:47:36.977
Shit!

766
00:47:39.381 --> 00:47:41.781
(breathing heavily)

767
00:47:41.781 --> 00:47:42.614
Oh my God!

768
00:47:49.110 --> 00:47:50.500
What the fuck was that?

769
00:47:54.950 --> 00:47:56.093
I'm not going back.

770
00:47:59.950 --> 00:48:01.690
I'm not going back I don't care.

771
00:48:04.464 --> 00:48:06.543
I don't care, I'm not going back.

772
00:48:07.620 --> 00:48:08.790
I'm not going back.

773
00:48:51.670 --> 00:48:53.943
At this point I wanna run into somebody.

774
00:48:57.620 --> 00:48:59.770
I wanna know what I'm
fucking running from!


775
00:49:13.243 --> 00:49:16.993
I've been walking for
two or three hours now.


776
00:49:24.283 --> 00:49:25.116
I...

777
00:49:26.070 --> 00:49:30.753
I haven't seen a road or a house,

778
00:49:34.670 --> 00:49:35.997
or heard a car.

779
00:49:38.763 --> 00:49:40.680
Everything is the same.

780
00:49:41.824 --> 00:49:44.843
(Clayton sobs)

781
00:49:44.843 --> 00:49:45.760
Where am I?

782
00:50:27.162 --> 00:50:27.995
I'm done.

783
00:51:38.188 --> 00:51:41.188
(breathing heavily)

784
00:51:43.447 --> 00:51:45.697
There's a cabin, there's a cabin!

785
00:51:45.697 --> 00:51:47.030
There's a cabin.

786
00:52:11.233 --> 00:52:13.316
(groans)

787
00:52:15.937 --> 00:52:16.770
What the fuck?

788
00:52:26.520 --> 00:52:28.060
What is this place?

789
00:52:34.737 --> 00:52:35.570
Is this a Bible?

790
00:53:24.406 --> 00:53:26.489
(groans)

791
00:53:28.810 --> 00:53:31.233
The creepiest place I have ever seen.

792
00:53:34.510 --> 00:53:37.813
Six chairs in a perfect circle.

793
00:53:41.265 --> 00:53:42.910
(indistinct rumbling)

794
00:53:42.910 --> 00:53:44.183
Is anyone there?

795
00:53:50.890 --> 00:53:52.153
I'm gonna die here.

796
00:53:56.437 --> 00:53:59.657
"Be strong and courageous.

797
00:53:59.657 --> 00:54:03.217
"Do not be frightened
and do not be dismayed,


798
00:54:03.217 --> 00:54:06.428
"for the Lord your God is
with you where you go."


799
00:54:06.428 --> 00:54:08.678
(wretches)

800
00:54:21.964 --> 00:54:26.047
(groans)
(sobs)


801
00:55:12.911 --> 00:55:16.161
(electronic crackling)

802
00:55:24.154 --> 00:55:25.321
Hold me truth.

803
00:55:38.597 --> 00:55:41.967
"In the beginning there was nothing,

804
00:55:41.967 --> 00:55:44.663
"and yet though the savior
worshiped it wholly.


805
00:55:46.527 --> 00:55:50.473
"He prayed to nothing, for
nothing to return eternally.


806
00:55:52.657 --> 00:55:55.897
"We pursued daily his acceptance,

807
00:55:55.897 --> 00:56:00.897
"and aspire to one day
become nothing as he did.


808
00:56:05.855 --> 00:56:09.105
(floorboards creaking)

809
00:56:14.670 --> 00:56:17.935
Yep, I'm back at the campsite.

810
00:56:17.935 --> 00:56:20.018
(laughs)

811
00:56:21.040 --> 00:56:22.563
Why am I here?

812
00:56:25.834 --> 00:56:28.500
Well one time I ate gas station sushi.

813
00:56:28.500 --> 00:56:30.633
Man do I make good decisions.

814
00:56:32.300 --> 00:56:35.973
It's like I run a fucking
irresponsibility brothel.


815
00:56:41.040 --> 00:56:44.773
I, I cannot leave.

816
00:56:45.940 --> 00:56:50.940
She knows where I am by
GPS, I cannot fucking leave.


817
00:56:57.160 --> 00:56:58.543
If I die, I die.

818
00:57:00.400 --> 00:57:01.523
Everybody does.

819
00:57:03.530 --> 00:57:07.890
Everybody that ever existed
before 150 years ago,


820
00:57:07.890 --> 00:57:08.733
they all did it.

821
00:57:10.053 --> 00:57:10.886
It's one, fuck...

822
00:57:10.886 --> 00:57:14.650
It's one of the only things
that we have in common,


823
00:57:14.650 --> 00:57:17.600
we're not all white, we're not all black,

824
00:57:17.600 --> 00:57:19.863
we're not all tall, we're not all short.

825
00:57:22.580 --> 00:57:23.573
But we all die.

826
00:57:26.160 --> 00:57:27.833
Somehow that's comforting.

827
00:57:35.627 --> 00:57:37.544
Mikaila, where are you?

828
00:57:40.111 --> 00:57:42.028
There's something here.

829
00:57:43.250 --> 00:57:46.603
I haven't seen it, but
there's something here.


830
00:57:50.191 --> 00:57:52.510
(sobs)

831
00:57:52.510 --> 00:57:53.653
I can't leave.

832
00:57:57.270 --> 00:57:58.773
I just have to wait it out.

833
00:58:01.493 --> 00:58:02.843
Are you fucking kidding me?

834
00:58:11.330 --> 00:58:13.063
What should I do Mr. Red Dot?

835
00:58:19.253 --> 00:58:24.253
When I was a little kid, my
best friend was a pitch back.


836
00:58:24.348 --> 00:58:27.290
You know the netting that
throws the balls back to ya,


837
00:58:27.290 --> 00:58:29.163
his name was Gus.

838
00:58:30.960 --> 00:58:35.270
Gus was such an asshole,
he always tried to peg me


839
00:58:35.270 --> 00:58:38.013
with baseballs.
(laughs)


840
00:58:42.230 --> 00:58:43.133
That was funny.

841
00:58:44.680 --> 00:58:46.229
That was funny.

842
00:58:46.229 --> 00:58:48.973
Don't just, don't just sit
there okay, laugh at me!


843
00:58:54.549 --> 00:58:56.170
I'm sorry.

844
00:58:56.170 --> 00:58:58.093
I'm sorry I raised my voice.

845
00:58:59.250 --> 00:59:01.303
You're just so passive.

846
00:59:04.500 --> 00:59:05.483
So I am sorry.

847
00:59:09.830 --> 00:59:11.723
Do you accept my apology?

848
00:59:15.970 --> 00:59:18.463
Do you accept my apology?

849
00:59:20.292 --> 00:59:22.240
(laughs)

850
00:59:22.240 --> 00:59:23.670
If you're not gonna talk to me then

851
00:59:23.670 --> 00:59:25.020
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

852
00:59:28.730 --> 00:59:30.333
My first word was ball.

853
00:59:32.310 --> 00:59:34.350
I don't even remember when
I started playing baseball


854
00:59:34.350 --> 00:59:37.900
but I played it all my life,
all through high school.


855
00:59:37.900 --> 00:59:41.440
I was a pitcher, in
high school we made it

856
00:59:41.440 --> 00:59:43.000
to the semi-finals.

857
00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:47.503
I'm one pitch away from
making it to the finals.


858
00:59:47.503 --> 00:59:49.090
There's a man on second and
third, and what do I do?


859
00:59:49.090 --> 00:59:51.233
I throw a fast
ball right down the middle,

860
00:59:52.980 --> 00:59:54.243
three run home run.

861
00:59:55.860 --> 00:59:59.370
I know it seems
stupid, but in high school

862
00:59:59.370 --> 01:00:00.743
baseball was life.

863
01:00:01.620 --> 01:00:04.530
So the whole rest of
the hour and a half

864
01:00:04.530 --> 01:00:06.470
all these people started coming up to me,

865
01:00:06.470 --> 01:00:08.920
telling me what a good
job I did, and how lucky


866
01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:11.213
this batter as that
he hit a home run.

867
01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:15.393
I just wanted to be alone.

868
01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:20.430
Looking back on that day, right now,

869
01:00:20.430 --> 01:00:22.333
it seems like a utopia.

870
01:00:27.290 --> 01:00:28.573
Best day of my life.

871
01:00:33.649 --> 01:00:34.703
I guess I'll watch this.

872
01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.950
It'll at least give me something to do.

873
01:00:41.810 --> 01:00:44.480
- So Clayton we hope you're
having an amazing trip,


874
01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:46.770
and I hope you're
finding all of the things


875
01:00:46.770 --> 01:00:48.360
you were searching for.

876
01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:51.110
And we decided that after
our day of interviews


877
01:00:51.110 --> 01:00:52.660
there was something we wanted to tell you.

878
01:00:52.660 --> 01:00:53.770
- Mikaila's pregnant.

879
01:00:53.770 --> 01:00:54.603
- What no,

880
01:00:54.603 --> 01:00:55.560
I am not pregnant.
- With my child.


881
01:00:55.560 --> 01:00:56.760
- Hunter take this seriously.

882
01:00:56.760 --> 01:00:57.593
- Okay.

883
01:00:58.537 --> 01:00:59.370
(sighs)

884
01:00:59.370 --> 01:01:00.660
We love you.

885
01:01:00.660 --> 01:01:01.493
Is that good?
- Yeah.


886
01:01:01.493 --> 01:01:02.937
That's it.

887
01:01:02.937 --> 01:01:03.940
That's it, we love you.

888
01:01:03.940 --> 01:01:07.120
And er, I've never met
someone as dedicated


889
01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:08.880
to making me laugh as you are.

890
01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:11.400
- Well, I, I
wouldn't, don't lie to him,

891
01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:13.300
I mean he tries really hard,

892
01:01:13.300 --> 01:01:15.040
and that's what really counts.

893
01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:16.680
- No it's true, you
do, you make me laugh.

894
01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:19.363
- You definitely try,
and that is so admirable.


895
01:01:20.530 --> 01:01:21.580
But anyway, (laughs),

896
01:01:22.450 --> 01:01:24.160
we know you can come back
with something great.


897
01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:26.830
Um, we know how capable you
are, and we hope you do.


898
01:01:26.830 --> 01:01:28.490
Um, but--

899
01:01:28.490 --> 01:01:30.090
- We just want you to come home.

900
01:01:31.877 --> 01:01:33.340
- And to shave your
fucking depression beard.


901
01:01:33.340 --> 01:01:34.878
- Hunter.
- Yeah.


902
01:01:34.878 --> 01:01:37.403
- And one more thing.

903
01:01:39.620 --> 01:01:42.315
I just want this
to be clear, all right,

904
01:01:42.315 --> 01:01:44.200
I would be perfectly
happy with you and me

905
01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:46.050
just bullshitting through life

906
01:01:46.050 --> 01:01:48.713
if that was the
only way to be us.

907
01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:50.993
I love you.

908
01:01:58.638 --> 01:02:01.221
(Clayton sobs)

909
01:02:21.822 --> 01:02:25.405
- Well it's night four,
wish I wasn't here,


910
01:02:30.850 --> 01:02:31.953
wish I could go home.

911
01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:37.590
But I guess if
I didn't feel this way

912
01:02:37.590 --> 01:02:40.273
then the experiment
would be a failure right?


913
01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:48.723
That has been happening all night.

914
01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:54.660
They're just marching in a giant circle.

915
01:02:54.660 --> 01:02:57.060
They, they never stop,
they're never close enough


916
01:02:57.060 --> 01:03:00.013
to be seen, it's fucking cruel.

917
01:03:04.730 --> 01:03:08.240
I'm just, I'm just
trying to keep my mind

918
01:03:10.150 --> 01:03:11.723
busy you know.

919
01:03:13.230 --> 01:03:16.660
I'm scared to let my
mind become idle because


920
01:03:17.910 --> 01:03:19.503
it might not be mine again.

921
01:03:21.007 --> 01:03:22.663
I was wrong though, about fear.

922
01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:34.753
My new thoughts.

923
01:03:43.650 --> 01:03:48.650
Mr. Red Dot, my
new thoughts are that fear

924
01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:53.003
is actually based in the mind.

925
01:03:54.680 --> 01:03:59.680
I mean what is scarier
then knowing your sanity


926
01:03:59.940 --> 01:04:01.383
is actually crumbling?

927
01:04:02.420 --> 01:04:04.980
I mean scarier then any
monster could ever be


928
01:04:04.980 --> 01:04:08.110
because if you were chased by a monster

929
01:04:08.110 --> 01:04:09.390
at least you can run.

930
01:04:09.390 --> 01:04:12.020
But whenever you are
insane you have nothing


931
01:04:12.020 --> 01:04:14.743
to believe in but your own thoughts.

932
01:04:16.810 --> 01:04:18.247
And they're lies.

933
01:04:20.931 --> 01:04:22.927
They're lies, they're not even real.

934
01:04:26.510 --> 01:04:28.270
So you're more then alone.

935
01:04:32.743 --> 01:04:35.576
(distant banging)

936
01:04:37.110 --> 01:04:40.353
The next obvious sound I hear,

937
01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:43.690
I'm gonna sprint straight towards it.

938
01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:46.073
I don't care anymore.

939
01:04:53.484 --> 01:04:58.110
(indistinct rumbling)
(groans)


940
01:04:58.110 --> 01:04:59.230
(Clayton laughs)

941
01:04:59.230 --> 01:05:00.197
Where are you?

942
01:05:06.329 --> 01:05:08.724
Stop it!
(Clayton sobs)


943
01:05:08.724 --> 01:05:10.391
Why won't... Oh God.

944
01:05:37.409 --> 01:05:41.100
They only want me to finish the story.

945
01:05:41.100 --> 01:05:45.170
I know how.

946
01:05:45.170 --> 01:05:46.593
All the words are blurry.

947
01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:52.033
It's like my eyes won't uncross.

948
01:05:54.531 --> 01:05:56.614
(laughs)

949
01:05:58.049 --> 01:06:00.850
But nothing, nothing is there.

950
01:06:00.850 --> 01:06:02.373
Nothing is there I know that.

951
01:06:03.787 --> 01:06:05.430
But they, they, that's all that they want,

952
01:06:05.430 --> 01:06:07.403
they just want me to finish the story.

953
01:06:10.450 --> 01:06:13.630
And I want too, I just, 
I don't know...

954
01:06:16.313 --> 01:06:17.146
I don't know if I'm ready.

955
01:06:22.990 --> 01:06:25.073
(laughs)

956
01:06:30.677 --> 01:06:35.187
"Be strong and courageous,

957
01:06:35.187 --> 01:06:39.411
"do not be frightened
and do not be dismayed."


958
01:06:39.411 --> 01:06:42.244
(distant banging)

959
01:06:51.410 --> 01:06:52.360
But they wanted me.

960
01:06:56.530 --> 01:06:57.363
They wanted me.

961
01:07:20.769 --> 01:07:23.143
I don't think it would be
that bad to die in your sleep.


962
01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:26.727
No anticipation, no fear.

963
01:07:29.593 --> 01:07:30.676
Just the end.

964
01:07:40.508 --> 01:07:42.307
(indistinct rumbling)
(gasps)


965
01:07:42.307 --> 01:07:43.140
Shit!

966
01:07:48.468 --> 01:07:49.635
What the fuck?

967
01:07:52.068 --> 01:07:53.735
How did that just...

968
01:08:27.538 --> 01:08:28.621
What is this?

969
01:08:40.639 --> 01:08:43.972
"He who seeks good, will find good will.

970
01:08:45.115 --> 01:08:49.115
"But evil will come to
him who searches for it."


971
01:09:49.890 --> 01:09:50.903
I can't speak.

972
01:09:52.370 --> 01:09:54.557
Every time I do they get closer.

973
01:10:08.058 --> 01:10:13.058
(distant rustling)
(breathing heavily)


974
01:10:21.619 --> 01:10:23.619
(gasps)

975
01:10:39.022 --> 01:10:40.689
Fuck, what the fuck.

976
01:10:41.598 --> 01:10:42.431
Fuck!

977
01:10:56.828 --> 01:10:57.745
Fuck, Fuck.

978
01:11:00.673 --> 01:11:01.506
Fuck.

979
01:11:08.715 --> 01:11:11.715
I pray I'll die in my sleep tonight.

980
01:11:12.673 --> 01:11:13.840
Where are you?

981
01:11:15.534 --> 01:11:16.951
Mikaila, Mikaila!

982
01:11:21.430 --> 01:11:25.563
I'm sorry dad, I could have
learned so much from you.


983
01:11:28.250 --> 01:11:31.720
You're a fucking superhero
and I hope you know that.


984
01:11:34.752 --> 01:11:37.252
Mikaila, I'm so sorry Mikaila.

985
01:11:38.833 --> 01:11:40.166
I don't wanna...

986
01:11:43.480 --> 01:11:45.230
My mind is my own.

987
01:11:45.230 --> 01:11:47.277
My mind is my own!

988
01:11:56.029 --> 01:11:57.529
My mind is my own.

989
01:11:59.452 --> 01:12:01.355
My mind is my own.

990
01:12:01.355 --> 01:12:02.855
My mind is my own.

991
01:12:16.977 --> 01:12:19.290
Oh my, what the fuck!

992
01:12:19.290 --> 01:12:20.123
No!

993
01:12:23.170 --> 01:12:25.473
Leave me alone, no!

994
01:12:28.875 --> 01:12:29.708
Oh my God.

995
01:12:33.094 --> 01:12:34.761
Just leave me alone!

996
01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:39.873
Here I was trying to write something dark,

997
01:12:41.490 --> 01:12:42.883
but I wasn't embracing it.

998
01:12:46.550 --> 01:12:47.383
But here it is.

999
01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:50.420
I hope they'll be pleased.

1000
01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:54.510
My mind is my own,
my mind is my own.

1001
01:12:54.510 --> 01:12:55.773
My mind is my own.

1002
01:12:59.210 --> 01:13:01.140
What happened here today,

1003
01:13:01.140 --> 01:13:02.690
what will happen to me tonight,

1004
01:13:04.050 --> 01:13:06.093
only those who pursue daily will know.

1005
01:13:07.409 --> 01:13:09.494
(screams)

1006
01:13:09.494 --> 01:13:11.987
My mind is my own,
my mind is my own.

1007
01:13:13.250 --> 01:13:15.043
My mind is my only truth.

1008
01:13:16.370 --> 01:13:19.533
Only truth, 11:27.

1009
01:13:20.430 --> 01:13:22.923
Only truth, 11:27.

1010
01:13:44.257 --> 01:13:46.840
(Clayton sobs)

1011
01:13:49.880 --> 01:13:50.933
Where are you?

1012
01:13:56.337 --> 01:13:58.170
What do you look like?

1013
01:14:01.313 --> 01:14:02.896
Just show yourself.

1014
01:14:07.750 --> 01:14:09.583
What do you look like?

1015
01:14:15.057 --> 01:14:16.640
Just show yourself.

1016
01:14:19.713 --> 01:14:21.380
Show yourself to me!

1017
01:14:31.334 --> 01:14:35.084
(tense suspenseful rumbling)

1018
01:14:58.395 --> 01:14:59.228
- Clayton!

1019
01:15:00.353 --> 01:15:01.920
Clayton!

1020
01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:04.694
I looked for you.

1021
01:15:04.694 --> 01:15:06.571
- Clayton!
- Clayton!


1022
01:15:06.571 --> 01:15:09.488
- Clayton, where are you?
- Clayton.


1023
01:15:11.291 --> 01:15:12.750
- He'd want us to finish it.

1024
01:15:12.750 --> 01:15:13.983
Mak, I promise.

1025
01:15:22.668 --> 01:15:24.251
We found the cabin.

1026
01:15:25.290 --> 01:15:27.313
That he stayed at um,

1027
01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:30.613
the third night.

1028
01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:37.177
We still didn't find any sign of him.

1029
01:15:38.930 --> 01:15:41.080
Your mind is just a fragile place

1030
01:15:43.211 --> 01:15:44.561
when you don't have anyone.

1031
01:15:50.193 --> 01:15:51.776
It's gonna be okay.

1032
01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:54.523
- I want one thing to be said.

1033
01:15:56.320 --> 01:16:00.273
He succeeded, he created something.

1034
01:16:01.450 --> 01:16:02.553
It wasn't worth it,

1035
01:16:03.930 --> 01:16:07.833
but his recordings said something.

1036
01:16:09.900 --> 01:16:13.843
He thought his project
was about loneliness,


1037
01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:17.633
it wasn't.

1038
01:16:20.790 --> 01:16:21.640
- Can you say it?

1039
01:16:27.030 --> 01:16:27.863
Please.

1040
01:16:31.291 --> 01:16:33.423
- It was the first
night I ever met him.

1041
01:16:38.488 --> 01:16:40.405
He tried to ask me out,

1042
01:16:42.140 --> 01:16:45.280
and after many failed attempts

1043
01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:50.280
he finally said, "We live
in a messed up world,


1044
01:16:51.657 --> 01:16:53.503
"full of messed up people.

1045
01:16:56.377 --> 01:17:00.017
"So why take the chance
and go through it alone?"


1046
01:17:05.320 --> 01:17:06.363
I said yes.

1047
01:17:12.871 --> 01:17:14.871
I don't wanna say it but

1048
01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:17.943
he's gone.

1049
01:17:22.740 --> 01:17:23.573
He's gone,

1050
01:17:26.460 --> 01:17:30.203
and I was here the whole time.

1051
01:17:32.510 --> 01:17:36.123
- But is too
much silence a bad thing?

1052
01:17:38.110 --> 01:17:41.470
Are the mundane relationships that we keep

1053
01:17:41.470 --> 01:17:43.623
the only things weaving us to sanity?

1054
01:18:02.075 --> 01:18:05.242
