TOURING BOOK
BY TONI KURZ


2
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.472
When you're at the bottom
- Toni once told me -


3
00:01:09.567 --> 00:01:11.364
at the foot of the wall...

4
00:01:11.776 --> 00:01:13.528
and you look up,

5
00:01:13.693 --> 00:01:16.491
you ask yourself:.
How can anyone climb that?


6
00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.522
Why would anyone even want to?

7
00:01:20.736 --> 00:01:24.126
But hours later
when you're at the top...


8
00:01:24.361 --> 00:01:26.591
Looking down,

9
00:01:26.778 --> 00:01:28.848
you've forgotten everything...

10
00:01:31.196 --> 00:01:33.346
Except the one person you promised...

11
00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.088
you would come back to.

12
00:01:40.406 --> 00:01:45.002
THE NORTH FACE

13
00:01:47.615 --> 00:01:50.083
Based on a true story

14
00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.799
The "Wall of Death" this perilous
Alpine face is often called.


15
00:02:02.035 --> 00:02:04.549
But German flying ace Ernst Udet...

16
00:02:04.743 --> 00:02:08.213
fearlessly comes within 20 metres
of its icy cliffs...


17
00:02:08.452 --> 00:02:11.364
in search of the missing
Munich climbers...


18
00:02:11.578 --> 00:02:14.376
Max Mehringer and Karl Sedlmayer.

19
00:02:15.537 --> 00:02:19.166
After forging into the middle of the face,
our brave troopers...


20
00:02:19.413 --> 00:02:21.608
died in their bivouacs.

21
00:02:21.788 --> 00:02:25.383
After the tragedy,
the canton of Berne decreed...


22
00:02:25.622 --> 00:02:28.853
that climbing the North Face
is strictly forbidden.


23
00:02:29.081 --> 00:02:33.313
But will this piece of paper
hold back German youth?


24
00:02:35.415 --> 00:02:39.454
With the Olympic Games approaching,
our proud youth senses...


25
00:02:39.708 --> 00:02:42.461
not only the peril
but also the lure,


26
00:02:42.667 --> 00:02:44.737
this challenge of their skills.

27
00:02:44.917 --> 00:02:46.316
For one thing is certain:

28
00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:50.213
The first men to summit will be
celebrated as Olympic heroes.


29
00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:56.659
And so the battle cry echoes through Europe:
Attack the Eiger North Face!


30
00:02:56.961 --> 00:03:00.749
We must conquer the
last problem of the Alps!

31
00:03:14.881 --> 00:03:17.520
BERLIN - MAY 1936
NEWSROOM AT THE BERLINER ZEITUNG


32
00:03:26.341 --> 00:03:31.654
We've contacted every Alpine club.
False alarm.


33
00:03:31.967 --> 00:03:34.686
Maybe it's just too early
in the season for...


34
00:03:35.634 --> 00:03:36.703
mountain climbing.

35
00:03:36.843 --> 00:03:39.915
Die-hard climbers die easier
than you think.


36
00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.807
Humans are foolhardy by nature.

37
00:03:42.969 --> 00:03:44.846
Do you know what this is?

38
00:03:45.011 --> 00:03:46.126
Not yet, boss.

39
00:03:46.261 --> 00:03:48.252
The Reich Press Secretary...

40
00:03:48.428 --> 00:03:50.100
instructs us to focus...

41
00:03:50.262 --> 00:03:53.015
on the first ascent of the Eiger.

42
00:03:53.221 --> 00:03:54.734
That's your jurisdiction.

43
00:03:54.888 --> 00:03:58.119
I want a German first ascent soon,
or you'll be...


44
00:03:58.346 --> 00:03:59.574
climbing it yourself.

45
00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:03.449
Henry,
what about that pair from Berchtesgaden?


46
00:04:04.598 --> 00:04:08.477
It was in the local paper.
Try to remember...


47
00:04:08.723 --> 00:04:11.635
Two men from the Mountain Brigade,
I think,


48
00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:15.125
and one of them is named...

49
00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:18.500
Hinterstoisser.
Yes, one is Hinterstoisser...


50
00:04:18.725 --> 00:04:20.636
and the other...

51
00:04:22.184 --> 00:04:24.254
- Henry?
- Kurz.


52
00:04:26.185 --> 00:04:27.584
What?

53
00:04:30.644 --> 00:04:32.362
What do you mean by "courts"?

54
00:04:32.519 --> 00:04:34.635
Andi Hinterstoisser and Toni Kurz.

55
00:04:35.395 --> 00:04:38.273
Mr. Henze meant them.
They'll scale anything tall.


56
00:04:38.478 --> 00:04:40.548
It's all they ever thought about as kids.

57
00:04:41.271 --> 00:04:43.068
Put one and one together.

58
00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:46.187
What have they dreamed about
since they were kids?


59
00:04:46.396 --> 00:04:49.229
Graduating from high school, Henze?

60
00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:50.792
Sorry, boss.

61
00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:55.967
About the Eiger, of course.
Climbing it first, Olympic gold, etc.


62
00:04:56.273 --> 00:04:58.867
How do you know about them?

63
00:04:59.732 --> 00:05:02.292
- Miss...?
- Fellner.


64
00:05:02.483 --> 00:05:06.032
I'm from Berchtesgaden too.
We practically grew up together.


65
00:05:06.275 --> 00:05:08.505
I know almost everything about them.

66
00:05:08.692 --> 00:05:09.761
Oh really?

67
00:05:11.818 --> 00:05:13.092
Everything?

68
00:05:28.612 --> 00:05:32.241
Around noon, after 27 hours of struggle,

69
00:05:32.488 --> 00:05:34.797
we summited
and shook hands in silence.


70
00:05:34.988 --> 00:05:37.024
It was a hard,
Life-renewing battle,


71
00:05:37.197 --> 00:05:40.075
for only one who
has felt death so near...

72
00:05:40.281 --> 00:05:42.431
...will truly know that Life is dear.

73
00:05:42.615 --> 00:05:45.254
Yes.
Your Private Kurz is a mountain poet.


74
00:05:45.448 --> 00:05:49.885
- That too?
- But they're also highly talented.


75
00:05:50.158 --> 00:05:52.911
Goll, Nordwand, Matterhorn,
Wartsteinkante...


76
00:05:53.116 --> 00:05:55.391
That was a first ascent.
A very difficult climb.


77
00:05:55.575 --> 00:05:58.533
Just this May.
Nobody thought it was possible.


78
00:05:59.368 --> 00:06:00.357
Well done!

79
00:06:00.493 --> 00:06:03.371
Why aren't they in Berne
attempting to climb the Eiger?


80
00:06:05.244 --> 00:06:06.233
I don't know.

81
00:06:07.369 --> 00:06:08.404
Oh, she doesn't know.

82
00:06:08.744 --> 00:06:10.177
Miss Fellner, come here.

83
00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:13.769
Here.

84
00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.418
This will get you 40 marks
for travel expenses.


85
00:06:17.621 --> 00:06:20.818
Then go to the stockroom
and have them give you a Retina.


86
00:06:21.038 --> 00:06:25.270
And then off you go to Berchtesgaden.

87
00:06:27.372 --> 00:06:29.602
Tell your old friends
that the German Reich,


88
00:06:29.789 --> 00:06:32.587
especially our editor-in-chief,
is counting on them.


89
00:06:35.249 --> 00:06:36.238
Pardon?

90
00:06:36.374 --> 00:06:40.652
Bring back a nice story, child. Go on!

91
00:06:43.417 --> 00:06:45.294
Do your Bavarian alpinists...

92
00:06:45.459 --> 00:06:48.769
Look anything like German heroes?

93
00:06:49.001 --> 00:06:51.231
More German and heroic than either of us.

94
00:06:51.918 --> 00:06:55.388
BERCHTESGADEN -
MOUNTAIN BRIGADE GARRISON


95
00:07:02.128 --> 00:07:03.561
Hinterstoisser! Kurz!

96
00:07:05.671 --> 00:07:08.469
Have we learned what curfew means?

97
00:07:08.921 --> 00:07:11.276
Or do you still think scaling mountains...

98
00:07:11.463 --> 00:07:13.419
excuses you from looking at your watches?

99
00:07:13.589 --> 00:07:15.944
Company Sergeant sir,
we don't own watches.


100
00:07:17.673 --> 00:07:20.824
In that case, Hinterstoisser,
I'll tell you...


101
00:07:21.507 --> 00:07:23.896
how long it is until quitting time.

102
00:07:24.091 --> 00:07:27.003
Exactly four urinals in the staff building,

103
00:07:27.216 --> 00:07:29.571
two company latrines in barrack V, and...

104
00:07:29.758 --> 00:07:31.430
one floor in the officer's casino.

105
00:07:32.134 --> 00:07:33.123
Carry on!

106
00:07:41.177 --> 00:07:43.737
Company Sergeant sir,
we don't own watches.


107
00:07:44.928 --> 00:07:46.122
Good job!

108
00:07:49.178 --> 00:07:50.167
Heil Hitler.

109
00:07:50.303 --> 00:07:51.292
Bye.

110
00:09:13.235 --> 00:09:14.224
Rope!

111
00:10:19.996 --> 00:10:22.032
We'll never make it this way.

112
00:10:22.205 --> 00:10:24.036
Let's traverse from below.

113
00:10:24.997 --> 00:10:27.465
C'mon, never say never.

114
00:11:24.216 --> 00:11:25.695
Everything OK?

115
00:11:26.591 --> 00:11:28.104
Yeah.

116
00:11:28.258 --> 00:11:30.374
Hinterstoisser, you heavy bastard.

117
00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:32.381
You need to do more push-ups, Kurz.

118
00:11:44.094 --> 00:11:45.243
But it was a good idea.

119
00:11:46.011 --> 00:11:48.366
Maybe it still needs a little work.

120
00:11:50.137 --> 00:11:52.207
You need to work on hammering in pitons.

121
00:12:05.431 --> 00:12:07.740
- Berg Heil, partner, we made it.
- Berg Heil.


122
00:12:09.224 --> 00:12:11.943
Here's to the new Hinterstoisser
-Kurz route!

123
00:12:41.062 --> 00:12:43.178
Angerer and Rainer are going for it.

124
00:12:44.605 --> 00:12:45.674
What?

125
00:12:45.813 --> 00:12:48.611
You know what I'm talking about.

126
00:12:48.814 --> 00:12:50.293
They're climbing the Eiger.

127
00:12:52.064 --> 00:12:53.053
Whatever.

128
00:12:53.815 --> 00:12:57.285
C'mon Toni,
we can beat those two left-handed.


129
00:12:57.524 --> 00:12:59.799
I know you,
you want to do the Eiger too.


130
00:13:03.858 --> 00:13:06.691
Or why did we scale the south face
of the Untersberg?


131
00:13:08.567 --> 00:13:11.764
- In the newspaper you yourself wrote...
- I know what I wrote.


132
00:13:14.985 --> 00:13:16.100
Scared, huh?

133
00:13:16.235 --> 00:13:18.624
I'm not scared of anything.

134
00:13:44.032 --> 00:13:47.024
Hi, Mrs. Kurz,
I'm bringing your Toni back home.


135
00:13:47.241 --> 00:13:49.232
Glad you got back safely.

136
00:13:49.783 --> 00:13:51.136
We've got a visitor.

137
00:13:52.075 --> 00:13:53.554
Yes. Here.

138
00:13:53.825 --> 00:13:55.861
I usually don't work in this jacket.

139
00:13:56.034 --> 00:13:57.592
That's OK.

140
00:13:57.742 --> 00:13:59.095
Makes a good impression.

141
00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:02.445
Luise!

142
00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:04.604
Come here.

143
00:14:04.744 --> 00:14:06.860
- Hello.
- Let's have a look at you. Hi.


144
00:14:09.411 --> 00:14:11.049
You look like a regular city girl.

145
00:14:11.203 --> 00:14:12.192
- Yeah?
- Yeah.


146
00:14:12.703 --> 00:14:14.022
You slipped.

147
00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:15.609
Yes.

148
00:14:15.996 --> 00:14:16.985
How is Berlin?

149
00:14:17.121 --> 00:14:19.112
- Loud and expensive.
- I bet!


150
00:14:22.163 --> 00:14:24.358
- Hi, Toni.
- Hello Luise.


151
00:14:26.539 --> 00:14:29.815
- Luise is a photo journalist now.
- Volunteer, Mrs. Kurz.


152
00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:32.998
And what do you do?

153
00:14:33.207 --> 00:14:36.882
For now, in the beginning
I mostly make coffee.


154
00:14:37.124 --> 00:14:38.637
For the editors.

155
00:14:38.791 --> 00:14:40.270
Well, well. Not bad.

156
00:14:40.417 --> 00:14:42.135
Yeah sure.
Not bad.


157
00:14:45.626 --> 00:14:47.935
I'll just take these things inside.

158
00:14:48.126 --> 00:14:50.356
Maybe you'll come tonight after all?

159
00:14:51.085 --> 00:14:53.758
Now that Luise is coming too.

160
00:14:53.961 --> 00:14:56.111
Where am I coming too?

161
00:15:23.591 --> 00:15:24.819
I'm back.

162
00:15:27.675 --> 00:15:30.473
- Same old Andi, hm?
- Yes.


163
00:15:30.675 --> 00:15:32.666
He's game for anything.

164
00:15:32.842 --> 00:15:34.195
And you?

165
00:15:41.010 --> 00:15:43.478
- When did you start smoking?
- A while ago.


166
00:15:53.054 --> 00:15:54.965
Hey, you two!

167
00:16:01.764 --> 00:16:04.278
I read your article in the local newspaper.

168
00:16:04.473 --> 00:16:06.031
It was great!

169
00:16:06.181 --> 00:16:10.094
My boss read it too.
You're the talk of Berlin.


170
00:16:10.349 --> 00:16:12.419
We are?

171
00:16:12.599 --> 00:16:14.954
You and the other top mountaineers.

172
00:16:15.141 --> 00:16:18.736
With the Olympics coming up,
they're pushing the Eiger.


173
00:16:18.975 --> 00:16:21.011
They want stories about the first ascent.

174
00:16:21.184 --> 00:16:23.652
- Full coverage.
- That's why you're here?


175
00:16:23.851 --> 00:16:25.364
They gave me the story.

176
00:16:25.518 --> 00:16:27.031
Evening.

177
00:16:27.810 --> 00:16:28.879
- Hello, Luise.
- Hi.


178
00:16:29.019 --> 00:16:30.975
- Back in Bavaria?
- Just temporarily.


179
00:16:31.478 --> 00:16:34.788
Luise is making her career
in the capital, Erlberger.


180
00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:37.250
Don't you wish you could too?

181
00:16:37.437 --> 00:16:39.428
I go wherever the Fuhrer needs me.

182
00:16:42.771 --> 00:16:45.968
Who knows why they chose me?
But imagine...


183
00:16:46.188 --> 00:16:48.179
if you did it!
You'd be on the front page.


184
00:16:48.355 --> 00:16:50.630
Berchtesgaden Heroes Conquer
Last Problem of the Alps!


185
00:16:50.814 --> 00:16:52.532
Famous all over Germany.

186
00:16:52.690 --> 00:16:53.679
Exactly.

187
00:16:53.815 --> 00:16:56.375
Front page,
and no more making coffee.


188
00:16:57.065 --> 00:16:59.420
Except for myself.
Cheers!


189
00:16:59.857 --> 00:17:02.007
I'm sure you'll write a terrific story,

190
00:17:02.191 --> 00:17:04.421
but not about us,
we're skipping the Eiger.


191
00:17:05.733 --> 00:17:06.802
What?

192
00:17:08.359 --> 00:17:10.714
You're skipping the Eiger?
No way, I know you.


193
00:17:13.443 --> 00:17:16.037
If you know so much,
you must have heard of...


194
00:17:16.235 --> 00:17:18.749
Max Sedlmayer and Karl Mehringer.

195
00:17:19.486 --> 00:17:23.115
We knew both of them,
two first-class alpinists.


196
00:17:23.362 --> 00:17:26.001
On the "Death Wall"
there's sunshine one minute...


197
00:17:26.195 --> 00:17:27.674
and a blizzard the next.

198
00:17:27.821 --> 00:17:30.210
Or you get hit by an avalanche
or a rock slide.


199
00:17:31.696 --> 00:17:33.334
That's not climbing.

200
00:17:35.905 --> 00:17:37.304
You can be the best,

201
00:17:37.447 --> 00:17:40.678
but it's still a lottery.
That's why we're skipping it.


202
00:17:42.323 --> 00:17:43.438
I'm tired.

203
00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:45.229
I'm going home.

204
00:17:46.449 --> 00:17:49.964
Andi, don't forget the curfew.
Luise, good luck,


205
00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:51.679
see you around.

206
00:17:55.534 --> 00:17:57.525
What was that?

207
00:17:57.701 --> 00:17:59.851
We prefer cleaning latrines these days.

208
00:18:21.788 --> 00:18:25.224
It's just like when
we went climbing as kids.

209
00:18:25.456 --> 00:18:27.686
- What?
- Me chasing after you.


210
00:18:32.665 --> 00:18:35.179
I want something I
can be proud of too.

211
00:18:35.374 --> 00:18:37.763
And if they print my story...

212
00:18:37.958 --> 00:18:39.516
You must understand that.

213
00:18:40.833 --> 00:18:42.312
I do understand,

214
00:18:43.125 --> 00:18:44.638
just find 2 other climbers.

215
00:18:44.792 --> 00:18:46.748
You're so stubborn.

216
00:18:50.418 --> 00:18:53.091
But I always waited
for you in the end.

217
00:18:57.836 --> 00:18:59.872
Faster, you can go much faster!

218
00:19:00.045 --> 00:19:01.034
Go!

219
00:19:01.170 --> 00:19:02.159
Lazy bastards.

220
00:19:02.295 --> 00:19:04.889
- Look at this joke of a wall.
- Leave me alone.


221
00:19:05.088 --> 00:19:06.919
No talking!
Climb!


222
00:19:07.088 --> 00:19:09.079
I thought you could do this.

223
00:19:09.255 --> 00:19:10.404
Faster!

224
00:19:14.173 --> 00:19:15.811
Thanks.

225
00:19:18.132 --> 00:19:19.281
Next!

226
00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:22.079
What's wrong?

227
00:19:22.966 --> 00:19:24.240
I'm not hungry.

228
00:19:30.509 --> 00:19:32.181
Hey, Andi,

229
00:19:32.342 --> 00:19:36.221
how long are you going
to be mad at me?

230
00:19:36.468 --> 00:19:40.507
How long are you going to be
too coward to even try?


231
00:19:41.136 --> 00:19:43.730
You and I could be
the first ones up there.

232
00:19:43.928 --> 00:19:45.998
That's not what climbing is about.

233
00:19:46.845 --> 00:19:48.198
Yes it is,

234
00:19:48.345 --> 00:19:50.063
that's exactly what it's about.

235
00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:53.132
I want to prove to the world
what I can do and who I am.


236
00:19:54.221 --> 00:19:56.371
I don't have to prove anything to anyone.

237
00:19:57.805 --> 00:19:58.999
I climb for myself.

238
00:19:59.139 --> 00:20:01.972
Understand? For me alone.

239
00:20:08.265 --> 00:20:10.256
Just arrived from Munich.

240
00:20:10.432 --> 00:20:14.027
I imagined it much bigger.
On such a tiny...


241
00:20:14.266 --> 00:20:15.699
I don't even know what it's called.

242
00:20:15.850 --> 00:20:16.839
Piton.

243
00:20:16.975 --> 00:20:20.285
Whatever. Just imagine a man's life
hangs from this tiny thing.


244
00:20:21.601 --> 00:20:23.751
You've got to be very determined.

245
00:20:32.144 --> 00:20:33.543
They backed down, right?

246
00:20:37.145 --> 00:20:38.214
How do you know?

247
00:20:42.229 --> 00:20:44.140
A reporter's most important tool.

248
00:20:48.356 --> 00:20:49.755
Next, please.

249
00:20:51.148 --> 00:20:53.059
Willy Angerer and Edi Rainer
are Austrians,


250
00:20:53.231 --> 00:20:54.664
but they're party members.

251
00:20:54.815 --> 00:20:57.966
And apparently top-notch alpinists.

252
00:20:58.191 --> 00:21:00.227
They're camped at
the foot of the Eiger.


253
00:21:00.399 --> 00:21:02.594
In the next few days...

254
00:21:02.775 --> 00:21:05.414
I'll be paying the gentlemen a visit.

255
00:21:05.609 --> 00:21:07.122
I see.

256
00:21:09.276 --> 00:21:12.393
Miss Fellner,
there'll be other times.


257
00:21:14.735 --> 00:21:16.134
Yes.

258
00:21:51.658 --> 00:21:54.616
Special leave until the end of July?

259
00:21:55.034 --> 00:21:57.309
Are you completely mad, 
Hinterstoisser?

260
00:21:59.076 --> 00:22:00.270
Reason?

261
00:22:00.410 --> 00:22:02.241
Private business, 
Company Sergeant.

262
00:22:02.410 --> 00:22:04.605
Don't play me for a fool, Andi!

263
00:22:04.786 --> 00:22:05.775
I'm not stupid.

264
00:22:06.202 --> 00:22:07.715
Company Sergeant, the truth is...

265
00:22:07.869 --> 00:22:09.939
I know what the truth is.

266
00:22:11.412 --> 00:22:13.607
Request denied.
Dismissed!


267
00:22:14.579 --> 00:22:16.854
Permission to speak, sir.

268
00:22:17.038 --> 00:22:18.107
It's for a wedding.

269
00:22:22.289 --> 00:22:25.247
You're just what I needed, Kurz.

270
00:22:26.831 --> 00:22:29.664
Well then, who is getting married?

271
00:22:29.873 --> 00:22:31.306
I am, Company Sergeant sir.

272
00:22:31.457 --> 00:22:32.492
You?

273
00:22:32.624 --> 00:22:35.536
And Private Hinterstoisser
is to be my best man.


274
00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:40.264
Get out!
Both of you!


275
00:22:40.458 --> 00:22:43.814
If we don't get our leave of absence,
we quit.


276
00:22:44.334 --> 00:22:45.323
Heil Hitler.

277
00:22:45.751 --> 00:22:47.184
Bye.

278
00:22:52.794 --> 00:22:54.671
Why did you change your mind?

279
00:22:55.919 --> 00:22:57.910
Because what I said wasn't true.

280
00:22:58.837 --> 00:23:00.111
I don't just climb for me.

281
00:23:01.462 --> 00:23:03.259
And someone has to watch out for you.

282
00:23:15.464 --> 00:23:17.819
That's enough,
now we need 10 ice pitons.


283
00:23:19.549 --> 00:23:22.985
Crampons, ice axes, carabiners,
short and long pick,


284
00:23:23.216 --> 00:23:26.174
two times 30 metres of rope,
two static chords...


285
00:23:26.383 --> 00:23:28.613
- There's no "h" in cords.
- Who cares?


286
00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:32.360
Two gasoline stoves, a litre of gasoline,

287
00:23:32.551 --> 00:23:34.860
a pack of Metas,
and so on and so forth.


288
00:23:35.801 --> 00:23:37.120
How much?

289
00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:38.818
Sixty marks. At least.

290
00:23:38.969 --> 00:23:41.119
Plus another 15 for the train.

291
00:23:41.302 --> 00:23:43.099
What train?
We're going by bike.


292
00:23:43.261 --> 00:23:46.617
Sure, by bike to Switzerland.
That's just 700 km, right?


293
00:24:00.306 --> 00:24:01.625
Miss Fellner?

294
00:24:03.390 --> 00:24:05.301
Just a second.

295
00:24:07.765 --> 00:24:08.754
OK.

296
00:24:12.683 --> 00:24:14.082
Evening.

297
00:24:14.850 --> 00:24:16.078
Working so late?

298
00:24:16.225 --> 00:24:17.624
Yes...

299
00:24:18.392 --> 00:24:21.987
The man in the photo department, he...

300
00:24:25.602 --> 00:24:27.672
What about him?

301
00:24:31.228 --> 00:24:35.141
He said that after we go to press
it's alright...


302
00:24:35.395 --> 00:24:37.511
for me to print my photos.

303
00:24:46.730 --> 00:24:48.846
Very nice. Really.

304
00:24:50.356 --> 00:24:51.505
Very good.

305
00:24:51.648 --> 00:24:53.081
Really very good.

306
00:24:53.232 --> 00:24:55.188
You take excellent photos,
Miss Fellner.


307
00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:58.078
Thank you.

308
00:24:59.316 --> 00:25:00.669
Ever been to Switzerland?

309
00:25:04.483 --> 00:25:05.472
No.

310
00:25:21.736 --> 00:25:23.647
We should be there by tomorrow.

311
00:25:24.945 --> 00:25:26.503
Are you excited too?

312
00:25:28.404 --> 00:25:29.473
Yeah.

313
00:25:32.405 --> 00:25:34.202
I can see her already.

314
00:25:34.947 --> 00:25:35.936
Who?

315
00:25:36.072 --> 00:25:37.061
The bride,

316
00:25:37.531 --> 00:25:39.123
beautiful, very beautiful,

317
00:25:39.823 --> 00:25:41.620
just a little tall next to you.

318
00:25:41.782 --> 00:25:45.297
3,970 metres, all rock and ice.

319
00:25:45.532 --> 00:25:47.011
Love at first sight, right?

320
00:25:48.116 --> 00:25:49.469
I'm not so sure.

321
00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:02.549
The train goes
straight through the mountain...


322
00:26:02.744 --> 00:26:05.304
all the way up to the Jungfrau.

323
00:26:05.494 --> 00:26:08.292
3,457 metres.

324
00:26:08.911 --> 00:26:09.900
Fancy that!

325
00:26:10.037 --> 00:26:12.107
Just look at the landscape!

326
00:26:12.287 --> 00:26:14.084
Isn't it splendid?

327
00:26:15.663 --> 00:26:18.541
Fabulously splendid.

328
00:26:18.746 --> 00:26:20.941
Darling, you didn't even look.

329
00:26:21.122 --> 00:26:23.078
The middle station.
This is where our hotel is.


330
00:26:23.247 --> 00:26:24.885
Four stars, at over 2,000 metres!

331
00:26:25.039 --> 00:26:27.712
I can see mountains on the Riviera.

332
00:26:27.915 --> 00:26:29.268
From the seaside.

333
00:26:29.415 --> 00:26:31.212
There it is!

334
00:26:40.125 --> 00:26:42.958
TUESDAY, JULY 14

335
00:26:44.209 --> 00:26:46.359
MIDDLE STATION KLEINE SCHEIDEGG -

336
00:26:51.794 --> 00:26:53.352
What a circus.

337
00:26:54.044 --> 00:26:55.363
Colossal.

338
00:26:55.503 --> 00:26:56.856
Come!

339
00:26:58.587 --> 00:27:01.021
A "sea of ice," Darling.
The seaside!


340
00:27:02.629 --> 00:27:04.142
Tours to the Maiden Saddle.

341
00:27:04.296 --> 00:27:07.811
I'm too old to be saddling maidens.

342
00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:09.495
Glacier tours!

343
00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:10.619
Look who's coming.

344
00:27:10.755 --> 00:27:13.553
Bartolo Sandri and Mario Menti.

345
00:27:13.756 --> 00:27:15.872
- Who are they?
- Italians.


346
00:27:18.257 --> 00:27:20.646
Another couple of fools.

347
00:27:20.841 --> 00:27:23.674
Come in a train, leave in a coffin.

348
00:27:29.217 --> 00:27:30.696
Quite a place, hm?

349
00:27:33.218 --> 00:27:34.651
You know what the best part is?

350
00:27:35.343 --> 00:27:37.413
It all counts as travel expenses.

351
00:27:37.593 --> 00:27:39.549
- Hello.
- Arau.


352
00:27:39.719 --> 00:27:41.789
- Mr. Arau.
- Yes.


353
00:27:41.969 --> 00:27:45.757
You have a magnificent room
with a view of the North Face.


354
00:27:46.012 --> 00:27:47.650
Your wife will be delighted.

355
00:27:47.804 --> 00:27:49.362
Too bad we're just colleagues.

356
00:28:09.849 --> 00:28:12.158
Pretty busy up here.

357
00:28:12.349 --> 00:28:14.704
All crackpots like you.

358
00:28:27.811 --> 00:28:29.210
Well?
Nice room?


359
00:28:29.686 --> 00:28:31.995
Yes.
It's even got a bathtub.


360
00:28:32.186 --> 00:28:34.177
Really?

361
00:28:34.353 --> 00:28:36.662
I don't suppose it's that cozy down there.

362
00:28:53.523 --> 00:28:55.514
I'll start a fire and cook dinner.

363
00:28:56.149 --> 00:28:58.265
You finish pitching the tent.

364
00:28:58.441 --> 00:29:00.159
Are we married or something?

365
00:29:00.316 --> 00:29:02.955
Don't talk, pet! Work!

366
00:29:03.150 --> 00:29:05.106
Now I know! You
remind me of my mother.

367
00:29:05.275 --> 00:29:07.266
- I am your mother.
- Grandmother.


368
00:29:07.442 --> 00:29:08.636
Mother-in-law.

369
00:29:09.734 --> 00:29:11.964
And that's the spirit
of the German conqueror...


370
00:29:12.152 --> 00:29:14.871
manifested in the battle
against the mountain.


371
00:29:15.444 --> 00:29:17.674
Bound together in life and death,

372
00:29:17.861 --> 00:29:21.058
the climbing partners dream of ice and rock.

373
00:29:21.278 --> 00:29:22.393
Do you see?

374
00:29:22.528 --> 00:29:25.042
The reader has to feel
Like he's really there,


375
00:29:25.237 --> 00:29:27.671
that's what makes a good story.

376
00:29:28.988 --> 00:29:31.502
The German soldier dreams of when,

377
00:29:31.697 --> 00:29:33.574
having fought to the summit,

378
00:29:33.739 --> 00:29:35.969
the world shall lie at his feet,

379
00:29:36.156 --> 00:29:39.228
and above him shall stretch
the limitless sky.


380
00:29:39.448 --> 00:29:40.597
That's a mouthful.

381
00:29:43.532 --> 00:29:45.488
I adore this kind of thing.

382
00:29:46.032 --> 00:29:47.021
Yeah?

383
00:29:47.158 --> 00:29:50.275
You adore Richard Wagner too.

384
00:29:51.533 --> 00:29:52.602
In any case,

385
00:29:53.159 --> 00:29:55.957
with great photos,
no one reads the words anyway.


386
00:30:00.285 --> 00:30:03.004
Did you see the French team's iron?

387
00:30:03.202 --> 00:30:05.272
They won't get as
far as the Rote Fluh.

388
00:30:05.453 --> 00:30:07.284
The Dagos don't even have ice axes.

389
00:30:09.370 --> 00:30:11.600
Look who's coming.

390
00:30:11.787 --> 00:30:14.585
Mr. Angerer and Mr. 
Rainer from Salzburg.

391
00:30:16.454 --> 00:30:18.012
Hello, boys.

392
00:30:19.288 --> 00:30:21.927
Look who we have here.
Heil Hitler.


393
00:30:23.664 --> 00:30:25.177
We wondered where you were.

394
00:30:25.331 --> 00:30:28.050
After all,
this is a gathering of professionals.


395
00:30:28.248 --> 00:30:31.001
Were you on the wall today?
Scouting around?


396
00:30:31.665 --> 00:30:32.814
No.

397
00:30:33.457 --> 00:30:34.446
Picking mushrooms.

398
00:30:35.708 --> 00:30:38.780
How high did you get -
picking mushrooms?


399
00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:40.228
What's for dinner?

400
00:30:41.625 --> 00:30:42.614
Barley soup.

401
00:30:42.751 --> 00:30:45.424
You say the German alpinist...

402
00:30:45.626 --> 00:30:48.345
dreams of the limitless sky?

403
00:30:48.543 --> 00:30:50.340
Very interesting.

404
00:30:50.502 --> 00:30:52.060
Would this be race-specific?

405
00:30:53.753 --> 00:30:57.143
I wonder, for example:
What does...


406
00:30:57.378 --> 00:30:58.447
the Austrian dream of?

407
00:30:58.587 --> 00:30:59.576
A Greater Germany.

408
00:31:02.546 --> 00:31:03.945
At least the Aryans among you.

409
00:31:04.088 --> 00:31:07.285
I wouldn't know
if that also applies to you.


410
00:31:13.464 --> 00:31:15.500
I was talking about mountaineers.

411
00:31:15.673 --> 00:31:18.107
Now they are a
breed of their own, hm?

412
00:31:19.174 --> 00:31:21.483
Aren't you homesick for Austria?

413
00:31:21.674 --> 00:31:23.505
Schuschnigg...

414
00:31:24.675 --> 00:31:26.506
can't hold out much longer.

415
00:31:30.301 --> 00:31:32.371
When Germany annexes Austria,

416
00:31:32.551 --> 00:31:34.189
we'll be home in
the wink of an eye.

417
00:31:34.968 --> 00:31:36.924
And then we call the shots.

418
00:31:37.093 --> 00:31:38.924
- It'll be our turn then.
- Aha.


419
00:31:39.594 --> 00:31:42.188
I don't know if
I could take being exiled.

420
00:31:43.470 --> 00:31:44.744
Did you see our iron?

421
00:31:45.887 --> 00:31:47.843
Steel pitons, rope, only the best,

422
00:31:48.262 --> 00:31:50.378
and all paid for by the SA.

423
00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:54.557
What do you have to do in return?

424
00:31:57.222 --> 00:31:58.701
Be the first ones at the top.

425
00:32:02.556 --> 00:32:04.911
WEDNESDAY, JULY 15

426
00:32:06.765 --> 00:32:11.156
The tunnel has a
total length of 7.4 km.

427
00:32:11.433 --> 00:32:13.344
And it took 15 years to build.

428
00:32:13.933 --> 00:32:15.002
Cost?

429
00:32:15.142 --> 00:32:17.451
16 million Swiss francs.

430
00:32:17.642 --> 00:32:20.918
Behind this wooden door
is one of the galleries...


431
00:32:21.143 --> 00:32:23.099
that opens out on the North Face.

432
00:32:23.268 --> 00:32:26.624
From here, excavated rock
was dumped straight into the abyss.


433
00:32:27.269 --> 00:32:30.818
We are now just shy of

434
00:32:37.021 --> 00:32:39.057
Sedlmayer and Mehringer started here...

435
00:32:39.229 --> 00:32:41.220
and climbed straight upward.

436
00:32:41.396 --> 00:32:44.672
Tedious, it's so steep
you'd need a piton every metre.


437
00:32:44.897 --> 00:32:46.125
I think...

438
00:32:48.564 --> 00:32:50.202
we should climb diagonally.

439
00:32:50.356 --> 00:32:52.153
Head for the gallery window.

440
00:32:52.315 --> 00:32:54.112
And stash gear there?

441
00:32:54.274 --> 00:32:57.505
Yes. Bivouac sacks, ice pitons, food, etc.

442
00:33:02.650 --> 00:33:05.801
EIGERWAND STATION - 2,865 M

443
00:33:09.776 --> 00:33:11.289
Careful, ladies and gentlemen!

444
00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:35.852
Amazing!
It goes down forever!


445
00:33:36.614 --> 00:33:38.286
Nearly 1,000 metres, Madam.

446
00:33:38.448 --> 00:33:39.676
Wow!

447
00:33:39.823 --> 00:33:41.575
Darling, did you hear that?

448
00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:44.812
Thanks, I believe it already.

449
00:33:45.908 --> 00:33:48.297
That anyone would voluntarily go out there!

450
00:33:48.825 --> 00:33:51.180
You've got to really want it.

451
00:33:51.367 --> 00:33:53.756
Then across the crack to the Rote Fluh...

452
00:33:53.951 --> 00:33:56.181
First ice field, second ice field,

453
00:33:56.368 --> 00:33:58.882
the Flatiron, the Ramp, the Spider,

454
00:33:59.076 --> 00:34:01.590
then a good exit crack to
the summit ice field,


455
00:34:01.785 --> 00:34:04.743
and hallelujah!

456
00:34:12.287 --> 00:34:13.276
Did you hear that?

457
00:34:13.746 --> 00:34:14.735
What?

458
00:34:15.413 --> 00:34:17.005
You didn't hear it.

459
00:34:30.499 --> 00:34:33.332
Careful!

460
00:34:33.541 --> 00:34:36.658
For crying out loud!
What are you doing?


461
00:34:37.083 --> 00:34:38.721
I knew it.

462
00:34:38.875 --> 00:34:40.547
What?

463
00:34:40.709 --> 00:34:43.098
I was just like you when I started.

464
00:34:43.293 --> 00:34:46.410
When you want something,
you forget everything else.


465
00:34:48.168 --> 00:34:50.238
Still here?

466
00:34:56.670 --> 00:34:58.706
You're up here every day?

467
00:34:58.879 --> 00:35:00.870
Every day and every night.

468
00:35:02.713 --> 00:35:05.227
- Sit down. I'll make tea.
- Miss Fellner, come.


469
00:35:09.172 --> 00:35:11.083
You must have a name, hm?

470
00:35:11.256 --> 00:35:13.133
- Von Allmen.
- What was that?


471
00:35:14.173 --> 00:35:15.731
Von Allmen.

472
00:35:16.798 --> 00:35:20.711
It looks sinister - the mountain.
Don't you think so?


473
00:35:20.966 --> 00:35:22.001
It is sinister.

474
00:35:26.383 --> 00:35:28.851
Do you know the
legend of the giant ogre?

475
00:35:29.717 --> 00:35:30.911
What's the guy's name?

476
00:35:31.051 --> 00:35:32.882
The mountain is named after it.

477
00:35:33.051 --> 00:35:35.201
Eiger. Ogre.
Do you follow?


478
00:35:35.968 --> 00:35:38.641
The legend says
the ogre lives in the mountain...


479
00:35:38.844 --> 00:35:42.519
and devours everyone who gets too close.

480
00:35:50.888 --> 00:35:53.004
THURSDAY, JULY 16

481
00:35:53.930 --> 00:35:55.966
- You can't see 5 metres in this fog.
- So?


482
00:35:56.139 --> 00:35:58.778
Just a few rope lengths
to the gallery window.


483
00:35:58.972 --> 00:36:01.042
We'll hammer a piton, stash our gear,

484
00:36:01.223 --> 00:36:03.134
and be back down for lunch.

485
00:36:03.306 --> 00:36:04.898
And? What are we having?

486
00:36:05.057 --> 00:36:06.206
Barley soup.

487
00:36:06.349 --> 00:36:08.101
Again? I'm staying here.

488
00:36:15.309 --> 00:36:16.628
Rope!

489
00:37:00.566 --> 00:37:02.761
No man has ever been up there.

490
00:37:05.984 --> 00:37:07.861
That will change.

491
00:37:22.028 --> 00:37:23.700
What are you doing at our entry point?

492
00:37:23.862 --> 00:37:25.136
Our entry point.

493
00:37:25.279 --> 00:37:26.268
Our entry point.

494
00:37:27.363 --> 00:37:28.842
What's your problem, bozo?

495
00:37:31.613 --> 00:37:34.002
- Berg Heil, mountaineer.
- Get lost!


496
00:37:46.408 --> 00:37:47.397
What did they say?

497
00:37:47.533 --> 00:37:49.285
It's too risky for them.

498
00:37:49.450 --> 00:37:51.805
And the weather doesn't look rosy either.

499
00:37:51.992 --> 00:37:53.186
Meaning what?

500
00:37:53.326 --> 00:37:55.203
If the Austrians back down too,

501
00:37:55.368 --> 00:37:59.441
the boss will wonder why
he's paying our expenses.


502
00:38:04.536 --> 00:38:05.525
Luise?

503
00:38:05.661 --> 00:38:06.776
Andi?

504
00:38:07.328 --> 00:38:08.966
What are you doing here?

505
00:38:10.620 --> 00:38:11.735
Working.

506
00:38:12.412 --> 00:38:14.403
This is my colleague, Mr. Arau.

507
00:38:14.579 --> 00:38:17.047
My pleasure.
Henry Arau, Berliner Zeitung.


508
00:38:17.246 --> 00:38:19.806
Andi Hinterstoisser,
Mountain Brigade - retired.


509
00:38:19.997 --> 00:38:22.227
Thought you didn't care about the Eiger.

510
00:38:22.414 --> 00:38:23.733
Who's your partner?

511
00:38:23.873 --> 00:38:24.862
Who do you think?

512
00:38:24.998 --> 00:38:25.987
Toni?

513
00:38:26.123 --> 00:38:27.351
Looks like it.

514
00:38:28.707 --> 00:38:30.777
There you go!
A full-scale attack...


515
00:38:30.957 --> 00:38:32.470
with a German team.

516
00:38:32.624 --> 00:38:34.376
Can I buy you a drink?

517
00:38:34.541 --> 00:38:35.576
Yes.

518
00:38:35.708 --> 00:38:37.300
I mean after you...

519
00:38:37.833 --> 00:38:39.186
change your clothes.

520
00:38:40.292 --> 00:38:42.567
I suppose I could shave.

521
00:38:44.334 --> 00:38:46.802
- The iron pitons for the ice fields...
- Ice pitons.


522
00:38:47.002 --> 00:38:47.991
Ice pitons.

523
00:38:48.127 --> 00:38:50.402
Your equipment must weigh a ton.

524
00:38:50.586 --> 00:38:54.420
We use a depot to save energy.

525
00:38:54.670 --> 00:38:56.388
You'll do a reconnaissance climb?

526
00:38:56.920 --> 00:38:57.909
Already have.

527
00:38:58.629 --> 00:39:00.779
- How high?
- Just under the Rote Fluh.


528
00:39:00.962 --> 00:39:03.760
But that's nowhere near
the Sedlmayer route.


529
00:39:03.963 --> 00:39:06.636
We're taking our own route.

530
00:39:07.839 --> 00:39:10.512
I don't understand a thing.

531
00:39:12.089 --> 00:39:14.444
But I find it terribly adventurous.

532
00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:20.729
Alright,

533
00:39:20.924 --> 00:39:25.042
then here's to adventure,
ladies and gentlemen.


534
00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:28.372
As long as a big pile of limestone...

535
00:39:28.592 --> 00:39:31.823
is all the German
heroes are out to attack...

536
00:39:32.051 --> 00:39:34.281
and conquer, I don't mind.

537
00:39:34.468 --> 00:39:36.299
Pride, Mr. Landauer,

538
00:39:36.469 --> 00:39:38.187
pride is what this is about.

539
00:39:38.344 --> 00:39:41.700
The pride of facing a challenge,

540
00:39:41.928 --> 00:39:43.680
whether it be in sports or politics.

541
00:39:45.345 --> 00:39:46.903
To this I raise my glass.

542
00:39:47.054 --> 00:39:48.089
Hear, hear!

543
00:39:52.138 --> 00:39:54.447
I'd Iike to propose a toast too.

544
00:39:56.639 --> 00:39:59.995
That you...

545
00:40:00.223 --> 00:40:03.021
all return safely.

546
00:40:03.223 --> 00:40:06.260
That's the important thing.

547
00:40:06.474 --> 00:40:09.511
That's what you wanted to say,
Mr. Arau, isn't it?


548
00:40:10.766 --> 00:40:13.326
Yes, let's drink to that.

549
00:40:13.517 --> 00:40:14.506
Cheers!

550
00:40:14.642 --> 00:40:15.757
Cheers!

551
00:40:22.477 --> 00:40:25.310
And now tell us
how it was growing up together...


552
00:40:25.810 --> 00:40:29.086
in the mountains.
It's great fodder for our story.


553
00:40:29.311 --> 00:40:30.983
Fodder is for animals.

554
00:40:33.437 --> 00:40:35.268
Just like the good old days,

555
00:40:35.437 --> 00:40:37.792
they've always been cocky.

556
00:40:37.979 --> 00:40:40.777
Isn't it colossally lonely so high up?

557
00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:42.015
No.

558
00:40:43.605 --> 00:40:46.597
- I have my partner with me.
- Yes, true.


559
00:40:47.106 --> 00:40:49.620
I tagged along
and made them teach me everything.


560
00:40:49.815 --> 00:40:50.930
Can you imagine it?

561
00:40:51.065 --> 00:40:54.262
For example,
catching a trout with your bare hand.


562
00:40:54.482 --> 00:40:57.360
- It's not easy.
- Very slippery.


563
00:40:57.566 --> 00:40:59.557
Real difficult.

564
00:40:59.733 --> 00:41:02.725
Or how to pitch a tent.

565
00:41:02.942 --> 00:41:03.931
Or ropes?

566
00:41:04.067 --> 00:41:06.581
Right, later how to wind ropes,

567
00:41:06.776 --> 00:41:08.971
how to drive pitons into the wall.

568
00:41:09.151 --> 00:41:10.869
How to find
the best hand- and footholds.


569
00:41:11.027 --> 00:41:13.905
I never wore skirts,

570
00:41:14.111 --> 00:41:15.988
- always just lederhosen.
- True.


571
00:41:16.153 --> 00:41:17.347
Really?

572
00:41:18.736 --> 00:41:19.725
That's wonderful.

573
00:41:19.862 --> 00:41:20.931
Tell me more!

574
00:41:22.237 --> 00:41:23.795
C'mon.

575
00:41:26.946 --> 00:41:30.461
Where did you learn that?
Did you teach yourself?


576
00:41:30.697 --> 00:41:33.655
My piano teacher boxed
my ears, so I quit...

577
00:41:33.864 --> 00:41:35.616
and just played in bars after that.

578
00:41:35.781 --> 00:41:38.295
Thanks for the invite.

579
00:41:39.823 --> 00:41:42.337
Won't you stay a bit?
It's just starting to get fun.


580
00:41:42.532 --> 00:41:44.523
It's late.

581
00:41:44.699 --> 00:41:46.610
A true athlete, hm?

582
00:41:46.783 --> 00:41:49.058
Disciplined, no loafing about, am I right?

583
00:41:49.908 --> 00:41:51.705
We each make our own decisions in life.

584
00:41:54.826 --> 00:41:56.020
Yes, that's true.

585
00:42:01.577 --> 00:42:04.216
We each make our own decisions.

586
00:42:04.411 --> 00:42:06.720
One has to take risks

587
00:42:06.911 --> 00:42:11.382
Then life's a game

588
00:42:11.662 --> 00:42:13.459
I say let's be reckless

589
00:42:13.621 --> 00:42:17.330
Rather than feckless
What good is that?


590
00:42:17.580 --> 00:42:19.889
All these newfangled things

591
00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:23.470
That life brings,
we just need to be bold


592
00:42:23.706 --> 00:42:28.222
We want to be gay, to laugh,
act silly and daft


593
00:42:28.498 --> 00:42:32.047
And it all works out in the end

594
00:42:32.291 --> 00:42:37.240
Take the bull by the horns,
don't hesitate


595
00:42:37.542 --> 00:42:42.377
For if you falter, you rust

596
00:42:47.752 --> 00:42:50.312
Faster, faster
Onward, don't wait


597
00:42:50.502 --> 00:42:52.458
Into the wild blue yonder or bust

598
00:43:16.257 --> 00:43:19.408
FRIDAY, JULY 17

599
00:43:44.595 --> 00:43:47.473
It'll get better, you'll see.

600
00:44:02.348 --> 00:44:03.827
You know what's sad?

601
00:44:04.599 --> 00:44:08.148
We'll always be deprived of
the real dramas.


602
00:44:11.308 --> 00:44:12.536
What do you mean?

603
00:44:12.683 --> 00:44:15.755
We and the readers.

604
00:44:15.976 --> 00:44:20.015
We report on the hubbub
at the Eiger beforehand.


605
00:44:20.268 --> 00:44:23.340
And perhaps on
a successful ascent afterwards.


606
00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:26.028
But what really takes place out there...

607
00:44:27.894 --> 00:44:30.249
is something we can only guess at.

608
00:44:31.978 --> 00:44:33.775
I wish it were already over.

609
00:44:33.937 --> 00:44:37.566
I wish it would finally get underway.

610
00:46:05.786 --> 00:46:08.380
I wanted to tell you last night...

611
00:46:11.412 --> 00:46:13.368
that I was a little tipsy.

612
00:46:15.955 --> 00:46:19.425
I'd appreciate you looking after this.

613
00:46:22.706 --> 00:46:25.140
But you always take it with you.

614
00:46:25.331 --> 00:46:27.003
Too heavy.

615
00:46:28.624 --> 00:46:30.182
Too heavy?

616
00:46:31.666 --> 00:46:35.181
I can write my entry afterwards.

617
00:46:36.250 --> 00:46:38.445
You could, but...

618
00:46:41.251 --> 00:46:43.606
Everything I've ever done is in there.

619
00:46:45.001 --> 00:46:47.720
It would be a
shame if it got lost.

620
00:47:05.172 --> 00:47:06.321
See you in a bit!

621
00:47:17.090 --> 00:47:18.125
Wake up!

622
00:47:26.300 --> 00:47:28.291
It's time.

623
00:47:29.593 --> 00:47:32.426
Yes. Yes, it's time.

624
00:47:37.844 --> 00:47:39.755
Don't make so much noise!

625
00:47:39.928 --> 00:47:42.283
You'll wake up the competition.

626
00:47:53.555 --> 00:47:56.945
SATURDAY, JULY 18 - 2:10 A.M.

627
00:49:06.776 --> 00:49:08.573
We're off to a good start, hm?

628
00:49:14.861 --> 00:49:16.658
- What is it?
- Nothing.


629
00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:18.048
Let's keep going.

630
00:49:18.236 --> 00:49:19.589
You lead.

631
00:49:19.737 --> 00:49:21.136
Watch out!

632
00:49:27.321 --> 00:49:30.040
Do you smell what I smell?
Sulfur.


633
00:49:30.239 --> 00:49:31.877
Stinks like the devil.

634
00:49:32.031 --> 00:49:33.703
At least they're showing us the way.

635
00:49:33.864 --> 00:49:37.982
We'll pass those eager beavers
before they hit the first ice field.


636
00:49:48.117 --> 00:49:50.187
Look!
We're almost at the depot.


637
00:49:50.367 --> 00:49:51.880
If the storm didn't take it.

638
00:50:09.620 --> 00:50:10.894
Could have been worse, huh?

639
00:50:14.330 --> 00:50:15.524
Damn!

640
00:50:16.413 --> 00:50:18.005
What?

641
00:50:19.455 --> 00:50:21.252
The crampons are gone.

642
00:50:25.415 --> 00:50:27.451
- Not much ice anyway.
- We cut steps.


643
00:50:29.916 --> 00:50:31.395
Hallelujah.

644
00:50:52.753 --> 00:50:54.266
Morning, gentlemen.

645
00:51:13.882 --> 00:51:15.235
Rock!

646
00:51:28.634 --> 00:51:32.149
...at the North Face the wheat has
finally separated from the chaff.


647
00:51:32.385 --> 00:51:33.374
Paragraph.
Got that?


648
00:51:33.510 --> 00:51:34.989
Pass that ashtray!

649
00:51:36.677 --> 00:51:39.908
Early this morning
two fully equipped teams started...


650
00:51:40.136 --> 00:51:42.047
up the wall.

651
00:51:42.220 --> 00:51:43.892
The lull is over,

652
00:51:44.053 --> 00:51:45.884
the last problem of the Alps...

653
00:51:46.054 --> 00:51:48.284
is under attack.

654
00:51:49.138 --> 00:51:50.253
Shit.

655
00:51:53.638 --> 00:51:56.357
- Let me see.
- It's OK, I'm fine. Hands off!


656
00:52:02.723 --> 00:52:04.315
I thought that was you.

657
00:52:04.474 --> 00:52:06.226
- Quit knocking rocks down on us!
- What?


658
00:52:06.391 --> 00:52:08.109
You kicked the rocks loose.

659
00:52:08.266 --> 00:52:11.144
If you're climbing in our fall line,
keep your distance!


660
00:52:14.559 --> 00:52:17.073
Three mountaineers...
No, four.


661
00:52:20.226 --> 00:52:21.545
From there, this way.

662
00:52:33.145 --> 00:52:37.423
We have a different entry point.
The Sedlmayer route is more to the left.


663
00:52:37.688 --> 00:52:40.361
Kurz and Angerer started here,
climbed to here...


664
00:52:40.563 --> 00:52:42.440
Here's the window to the cog railway.

665
00:52:42.605 --> 00:52:46.041
They cross over here
and enter the first ice field...


666
00:52:46.273 --> 00:52:49.709
and hit the Mehringer
-Sedlmayer route,

667
00:52:49.940 --> 00:52:53.489
climb up, over the second ice field...

668
00:52:57.733 --> 00:52:59.485
What do you say to this beautiful weather?

669
00:52:59.650 --> 00:53:01.720
I doubt it will hold.

670
00:53:01.900 --> 00:53:04.255
The French and Italian teams didn't set out.

671
00:53:10.652 --> 00:53:13.689
It's like at a gladiator fight!
Positively gruesome.


672
00:53:14.944 --> 00:53:17.060
I find it colossally exciting!

673
00:53:18.237 --> 00:53:19.352
Waiter!

674
00:53:35.823 --> 00:53:37.575
If something happened up there,

675
00:53:37.740 --> 00:53:38.968
would you rescue them?

676
00:53:39.115 --> 00:53:42.073
- We aren't legally required to.
- No.


677
00:53:44.324 --> 00:53:46.519
- What is he doing?
- Who?


678
00:53:46.700 --> 00:53:48.452
He's hardly using any protection.

679
00:53:48.617 --> 00:53:50.847
- Who?
- One of the Austrians.


680
00:53:52.117 --> 00:53:55.075
If he slips, that's an entire rope length.

681
00:53:58.410 --> 00:54:01.208
Ah, there they are!
Our hardy Mountain Brigade.


682
00:54:02.369 --> 00:54:04.087
Clearly the better climbers.

683
00:54:04.245 --> 00:54:06.679
Technically superior.
They might summit tomorrow...


684
00:54:06.870 --> 00:54:09.020
- May I...
- I've got this covered.


685
00:54:09.204 --> 00:54:12.480
You make sure we have enough shots
of the spectators...


686
00:54:12.704 --> 00:54:14.695
- Where is your camera?
- Right here.


687
00:54:14.871 --> 00:54:17.590
No sleeping, get to work!

688
00:54:18.539 --> 00:54:21.895
Look, show me I didn't make a mistake
with you!


689
00:54:23.706 --> 00:54:25.378
Step aside!

690
00:54:25.540 --> 00:54:29.738
Get your own magic eyepiece!

691
00:54:33.541 --> 00:54:36.135
1:15 P.M. ROTE FLUH - 2,823 M

692
00:54:37.584 --> 00:54:38.699
- Well?
- No.


693
00:54:39.167 --> 00:54:40.520
End of the line.

694
00:54:41.251 --> 00:54:44.402
It's pointless.
You need a piton every metre.


695
00:54:44.627 --> 00:54:47.061
Yeah, if you can even find a place
to sink them.


696
00:54:47.252 --> 00:54:49.163
This is a lousy route.

697
00:54:49.336 --> 00:54:50.928
You could take a different one.

698
00:54:51.086 --> 00:54:53.441
No one is forcing you to stick to us
like glue.


699
00:54:53.628 --> 00:54:55.266
We'll traverse this slab,

700
00:54:55.754 --> 00:54:59.349
climb up the chimney,
and cross over the ice field.


701
00:54:59.588 --> 00:55:01.226
You can't cross here!

702
00:55:02.171 --> 00:55:04.127
You always say "never say never."

703
00:55:04.672 --> 00:55:08.108
Have fun, gentlemen.
See you at the top.


704
00:55:08.339 --> 00:55:11.615
Though I doubt you'll make it.

705
00:55:17.299 --> 00:55:19.574
We'll rappel to a lower point
and cross there.


706
00:55:19.758 --> 00:55:22.477
I saw a good spot.

707
00:55:23.258 --> 00:55:24.930
Look!

708
00:56:00.390 --> 00:56:02.620
That was historic, wasn't it?
Historic.


709
00:56:06.432 --> 00:56:08.263
Where is she with her camera?

710
00:56:21.393 --> 00:56:23.349
Hinterstoisser Traverse.

711
00:56:23.519 --> 00:56:25.714
You'll be famous for that.

712
00:56:28.603 --> 00:56:29.752
Mind if we cross?

713
00:56:37.605 --> 00:56:40.324
What's this?
The Austrians are coming along too.


714
00:56:40.522 --> 00:56:43.753
I thought they were the competition.

715
00:57:03.151 --> 00:57:05.619
- Wait.
- What?


716
00:57:06.026 --> 00:57:07.903
Maybe we should leave the rope here.

717
00:57:09.360 --> 00:57:10.793
The whole rope?

718
00:57:10.944 --> 00:57:13.617
- We're going to need it.
- Maybe.


719
00:57:13.819 --> 00:57:16.253
- Are we a team now?
- Not on your life.


720
00:57:16.445 --> 00:57:17.924
Then why did you let us over?

721
00:57:18.445 --> 00:57:20.242
So things wouldn't get boring.

722
00:57:21.696 --> 00:57:24.608
In case we have to come back.

723
00:57:24.863 --> 00:57:27.377
Now you're being overly cautious.

724
00:57:27.572 --> 00:57:29.290
Up there, that's the way to Berlin.

725
00:57:47.242 --> 00:57:50.757
3:30 P.M. FIRST ICE FIELD - 2,980 M

726
00:58:38.542 --> 00:58:40.931
- It stinks without crampons.
- Who needs them?


727
00:58:41.126 --> 00:58:44.914
- They Austrians don't have any either.
- Yeah, that does help.


728
00:58:51.628 --> 00:58:52.981
What's with those sissies?

729
00:58:53.128 --> 00:58:54.641
Have they given up already?

730
00:58:58.421 --> 00:59:00.537
8:30 P.M.

731
00:59:04.880 --> 00:59:06.313
Toni it'll be dark soon.

732
00:59:06.464 --> 00:59:08.295
Let's find a nice b&b?

733
00:59:17.132 --> 00:59:20.886
FIRST BIVOUAC - 3,100 M

734
00:59:35.594 --> 00:59:38.028
We're more than halfway.

735
00:59:38.219 --> 00:59:40.289
We might make it by tomorrow.

736
00:59:40.470 --> 00:59:42.825
Yeah. And ahead of them!

737
01:00:07.683 --> 01:00:11.312
Ladies and gentlemen,
the house presents this cake...


738
01:00:11.558 --> 01:00:14.994
to celebrate the first ascent
of the Eiger North Face.


739
01:00:15.226 --> 01:00:16.818
It won't be long now.

740
01:00:16.976 --> 01:00:18.967
Tomorrow the Eiger will be conquered -

741
01:00:19.143 --> 01:00:22.579
today you can consume a piece of it.

742
01:00:22.810 --> 01:00:24.402
Bon appetit!

743
01:00:30.228 --> 01:00:33.459
Give me one of those
darling climbers, please.


744
01:00:39.938 --> 01:00:42.532
You're lucky, Madam.
Bon appetit!


745
01:00:43.522 --> 01:00:45.877
If it were at least an Austrian.

746
01:00:57.191 --> 01:00:58.180
Tomorrow evening...

747
01:00:58.317 --> 01:01:00.706
we'll be down there surrounded by women...

748
01:01:00.900 --> 01:01:02.731
basking in a hot bathtub...

749
01:01:02.901 --> 01:01:04.414
like heroes.

750
01:01:04.568 --> 01:01:06.081
You'll see.

751
01:01:07.485 --> 01:01:09.874
You don't look good at all.

752
01:01:13.153 --> 01:01:15.906
It's not a beauty contest.

753
01:01:18.904 --> 01:01:21.020
I just need a little sleep.

754
01:01:21.196 --> 01:01:22.754
A little sleep.

755
01:01:24.571 --> 01:01:26.687
Well?
Did you take care of the film?


756
01:01:26.863 --> 01:01:29.252
Yes, it's all on its way to Berlin.

757
01:01:29.739 --> 01:01:32.572
See, that's how I like it.

758
01:01:33.156 --> 01:01:34.430
Want a taste?

759
01:01:34.573 --> 01:01:37.849
Carved it out of the Eiger
with the sweat of my own brow.


760
01:01:38.074 --> 01:01:39.871
It's delicious.

761
01:01:47.909 --> 01:01:52.141
Being there when history is being written
gives you the shivers too.


762
01:01:52.409 --> 01:01:53.398
Or am I wrong?

763
01:01:55.327 --> 01:01:56.476
It's possible.

764
01:01:56.618 --> 01:01:58.848
Maybe you know me better than I do.

765
01:01:59.369 --> 01:02:00.358
Likely.

766
01:02:00.494 --> 01:02:02.405
And thanks to what?

767
01:02:05.662 --> 01:02:08.381
Well trained tool.

768
01:02:09.037 --> 01:02:10.914
Wake me if there's an avalanche.

769
01:02:12.705 --> 01:02:14.582
And turn down the wind.

770
01:02:28.124 --> 01:02:31.161
SUNDAY, JULY 19 - 6:05 A.M.

771
01:02:56.337 --> 01:02:58.612
- Morning.
- Morning.


772
01:03:20.383 --> 01:03:21.941
Come here.

773
01:03:24.967 --> 01:03:26.002
No.

774
01:03:26.134 --> 01:03:27.567
That's it, Willy.

775
01:03:27.718 --> 01:03:29.151
We're going back down.

776
01:03:29.301 --> 01:03:31.132
I'm fine.

777
01:03:31.302 --> 01:03:32.451
You just need to wake up.

778
01:03:32.593 --> 01:03:34.390
Willy, you need a doctor.

779
01:03:34.927 --> 01:03:37.043
I'm fine.

780
01:03:37.219 --> 01:03:41.929
You'll never summit like that, Willy, never.

781
01:03:42.220 --> 01:03:44.370
Shut up, Edi! Don't ever say that again...

782
01:03:44.554 --> 01:03:46.590
Are you crazy?
What's with you?


783
01:03:46.763 --> 01:03:48.594
Have you lost your mind?

784
01:03:48.763 --> 01:03:49.912
I need to get up there.

785
01:03:50.055 --> 01:03:52.694
It's no use.
Look, the doctor is down there.


786
01:03:52.889 --> 01:03:54.641
There's nothing down there.
Nothing.


787
01:03:54.806 --> 01:03:57.036
Just up there.

788
01:04:00.223 --> 01:04:04.660
Wake up, then you'll see it too.

789
01:04:19.310 --> 01:04:23.064
11:15 A.M. SECOND ICE FIELD - 3,150 M

790
01:05:28.030 --> 01:05:31.500
That one is Angerer, right?
Have a look.


791
01:05:34.531 --> 01:05:35.759
Left of that funny spike.

792
01:05:36.990 --> 01:05:38.423
Yes. He's acting strange.

793
01:05:40.657 --> 01:05:42.727
The guides say we can forget today.

794
01:05:42.908 --> 01:05:45.581
And at this pace,
they won't make it tomorrow either.


795
01:05:45.783 --> 01:05:48.172
That means bivouacking twice more?

796
01:05:48.367 --> 01:05:49.766
Yes.

797
01:05:49.909 --> 01:05:51.467
The weather isn't changing. So,

798
01:05:52.201 --> 01:05:53.475
no summit push today.

799
01:05:54.035 --> 01:05:55.673
C'mon, let's have a drink.

800
01:06:21.665 --> 01:06:22.893
What's wrong?

801
01:06:26.457 --> 01:06:29.130
It must be Karl and Max' things.

802
01:07:07.589 --> 01:07:09.147
Your compatriot from Munich?

803
01:07:10.340 --> 01:07:11.693
Yes.

804
01:07:12.257 --> 01:07:13.656
My condolences.

805
01:07:27.301 --> 01:07:30.373
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.


806
01:07:30.593 --> 01:07:31.582
Amen.

807
01:07:35.636 --> 01:07:36.625
Take care!

808
01:07:56.306 --> 01:07:58.581
How's Angerer doing anyway?

809
01:07:59.223 --> 01:08:02.454
He's not faking it, that's for sure.

810
01:08:10.559 --> 01:08:12.151
Can you see anything?

811
01:08:12.309 --> 01:08:13.298
More or less.

812
01:08:14.809 --> 01:08:17.277
It looks like they're one team now.

813
01:08:19.310 --> 01:08:20.459
But one is in bad shape.

814
01:08:52.649 --> 01:08:54.367
C'mon, wake up!

815
01:08:55.858 --> 01:08:59.817
3:40 P.M. FLAT IRON - 3,350 M

816
01:10:37.459 --> 01:10:39.450
Quick, tie a tourniquet!

817
01:10:57.879 --> 01:11:00.439
You should have taken your own route.

818
01:11:01.255 --> 01:11:02.973
You really should have.

819
01:11:12.632 --> 01:11:15.146
Shit, shit!

820
01:11:16.883 --> 01:11:18.635
We have to turn around.

821
01:11:21.425 --> 01:11:23.097
Turn around, why?

822
01:11:23.259 --> 01:11:27.218
Because he won't make it to the top.

823
01:11:27.468 --> 01:11:29.857
If we don't hurry,
he'll bleed to death.


824
01:11:30.052 --> 01:11:32.612
Listen, I can manage.

825
01:11:32.802 --> 01:11:35.111
You keep going.

826
01:11:35.302 --> 01:11:37.941
I'll rope him down alone.
I'll manage.


827
01:11:38.136 --> 01:11:39.728
- Alone?
- I can do it.


828
01:11:39.928 --> 01:11:42.726
- Don't be ridiculous, you'll never manage.
- I can do it.


829
01:11:42.929 --> 01:11:45.318
- It's a good idea.
- I'll manage.


830
01:11:45.513 --> 01:11:46.946
It's a very good idea.

831
01:11:47.096 --> 01:11:48.495
And we go on.

832
01:11:48.638 --> 01:11:50.708
To the summit.

833
01:11:50.889 --> 01:11:54.006
If we leave the two of them alone,

834
01:11:54.222 --> 01:11:55.211
they'll both die.

835
01:11:56.973 --> 01:11:59.089
Alright then,

836
01:11:59.265 --> 01:12:01.699
we'll do it together.

837
01:12:01.890 --> 01:12:03.767
We'll go up together.

838
01:12:03.932 --> 01:12:06.685
We'll pull him up with us.
We can do it.


839
01:12:06.891 --> 01:12:08.324
Don't be silly.

840
01:12:08.475 --> 01:12:10.989
This is screwed,
and we both know it.


841
01:12:13.017 --> 01:12:15.485
Why did I listen to you?

842
01:12:16.685 --> 01:12:19.279
We should just leave you behind.

843
01:12:19.894 --> 01:12:21.725
It would serve you right, Willy.

844
01:12:21.894 --> 01:12:23.612
Our only chance is over the summit.

845
01:12:23.769 --> 01:12:25.839
Forget the summit!

846
01:12:26.020 --> 01:12:27.658
It beats going down here.

847
01:12:28.312 --> 01:12:31.031
We'll cross over the
west ridge and get help.

848
01:12:31.229 --> 01:12:34.585
We don't know what awaits us up there,
and by the time we get down,


849
01:12:38.397 --> 01:12:39.432
he'll be dead.

850
01:12:40.605 --> 01:12:41.799
I promise you that.

851
01:12:44.023 --> 01:12:45.376
We have to get to the top.

852
01:12:46.106 --> 01:12:48.620
We have to keep going.

853
01:12:49.065 --> 01:12:51.454
Why did I listen to you?

854
01:13:45.825 --> 01:13:49.215
SECOND BIVOUAC - 3,250 M

855
01:13:58.869 --> 01:14:00.621
Then pull him out of the meeting!

856
01:14:00.786 --> 01:14:02.663
Tell him the tables are turning.

857
01:14:02.870 --> 01:14:04.542
Yes, of course, I'll wait.

858
01:14:04.703 --> 01:14:06.216
Is something wrong?

859
01:14:06.370 --> 01:14:08.122
It's over, mission aborted.

860
01:14:08.287 --> 01:14:09.322
What?

861
01:14:09.454 --> 01:14:11.365
Retreat.
The Salzburger bailed out.


862
01:14:11.955 --> 01:14:14.310
Yes, I'm still here.

863
01:14:14.497 --> 01:14:15.896
Hello, boss.

864
01:14:16.039 --> 01:14:17.870
Listen, I can't keep it together.

865
01:14:18.039 --> 01:14:21.429
Those two don't care
about the politics anyway.


866
01:14:21.665 --> 01:14:25.374
It would have been hard
to fashion them into German heroes.


867
01:14:25.707 --> 01:14:27.743
Yes, thanks.
See you back in Berlin.


868
01:14:28.291 --> 01:14:31.169
- Are we leaving too?
- Yes, it looks like it.


869
01:14:31.375 --> 01:14:35.004
Shouldn't we stay and report on
what happens up there?


870
01:14:35.334 --> 01:14:37.848
I don't want to patronize you, child,

871
01:14:38.043 --> 01:14:40.637
but you either need a glorious triumph...

872
01:14:41.085 --> 01:14:42.484
or a horrible tragedy.

873
01:14:42.668 --> 01:14:47.378
An unspectacular retreat...
is nothing more than a few lines on page 3.


874
01:14:47.669 --> 01:14:50.467
There's no need to stay for that.

875
01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:55.959
MONDAY, JULY 20

876
01:15:45.763 --> 01:15:48.277
Whoever said it's faster going down!

877
01:15:51.430 --> 01:15:52.749
We're in for a snowstorm.

878
01:15:54.598 --> 01:15:55.917
Shit.

879
01:16:27.812 --> 01:16:29.325
Over this way.

880
01:16:29.479 --> 01:16:30.832
This way!

881
01:17:38.407 --> 01:17:42.525
In this storm
they won't have made much progress.


882
01:17:42.783 --> 01:17:44.341
Do you think so?

883
01:17:44.492 --> 01:17:45.481
I'm certain.

884
01:17:47.867 --> 01:17:49.903
Let's just hope...

885
01:17:50.076 --> 01:17:52.431
they've found a decent place to bivouac.

886
01:17:55.327 --> 01:17:56.316
Otherwise...

887
01:18:01.161 --> 01:18:03.072
Maybe I should postpone my departure.

888
01:18:05.870 --> 01:18:08.179
It might be worth it to stay.

889
01:18:11.538 --> 01:18:13.574
I'm a reporter, what do you expect?

890
01:18:15.539 --> 01:18:17.495
Are you not also human?

891
01:18:17.664 --> 01:18:19.063
From time to time.

892
01:18:21.165 --> 01:18:23.440
Maybe my nose is wrong this time.

893
01:18:35.334 --> 01:18:38.644
THIRD BIVOUAC - 3,170 M

894
01:19:06.464 --> 01:19:09.262
Don't fall asleep or you'll freeze!

895
01:19:56.515 --> 01:19:59.075
TUESDAY, JULY 21 - 5:20 A.M.

896
01:20:36.147 --> 01:20:37.546
Where are you?

897
01:20:45.482 --> 01:20:47.359
For heaven's sake, child!

898
01:20:47.524 --> 01:20:50.721
What are you doing up this early?

899
01:20:50.941 --> 01:20:53.091
You'll catch your death of cold.

900
01:20:53.275 --> 01:20:55.106
There are people on the wall.

901
01:20:55.317 --> 01:20:58.036
They're somewhere near the Rote Fluh,

902
01:20:58.234 --> 01:21:00.748
that's 200 m away from here,

903
01:21:00.943 --> 01:21:03.662
we're almost on the east ridge here.

904
01:21:04.068 --> 01:21:06.582
They'll never hear you in this wind.

905
01:21:06.777 --> 01:21:11.009
We'd have to go over
to gallery window 38.


906
01:21:18.446 --> 01:21:19.959
Here it is.

907
01:21:31.406 --> 01:21:32.839
Watch your head!

908
01:21:51.993 --> 01:21:55.542
8:50 A.M. GALLERY WINDOW - 2,711 M

909
01:21:56.577 --> 01:21:57.851
Careful!

910
01:21:57.994 --> 01:22:00.064
It's icy.

911
01:22:04.495 --> 01:22:05.894
Child!

912
01:22:14.330 --> 01:22:16.048
Where are you?

913
01:22:25.666 --> 01:22:28.305
Why can't they hear us?

914
01:22:28.499 --> 01:22:31.013
Who knows how far away they are?

915
01:22:31.375 --> 01:22:33.605
Let's come back later,

916
01:22:33.875 --> 01:22:35.786
maybe the storm will have died down.

917
01:22:35.959 --> 01:22:38.837
We'll come back later.

918
01:22:43.544 --> 01:22:45.341
Wait!

919
01:22:45.502 --> 01:22:47.697
I think I heard something.

920
01:22:55.754 --> 01:22:57.233
It's Toni.

921
01:23:05.214 --> 01:23:07.284
That's Andi.

922
01:23:07.798 --> 01:23:08.992
We hear you.

923
01:23:15.091 --> 01:23:16.444
We're coming down.

924
01:23:17.175 --> 01:23:18.927
We're coming.

925
01:23:21.342 --> 01:23:22.331
C'mon, child.

926
01:23:22.467 --> 01:23:24.742
- Where?
- To make some tea.


927
01:23:29.010 --> 01:23:30.602
How much farther is it?

928
01:23:30.802 --> 01:23:33.236
- Can't be far.
- Yes.


929
01:23:34.719 --> 01:23:36.437
Another four metres.

930
01:23:36.595 --> 01:23:39.905
C'mon, a little further.

931
01:23:46.305 --> 01:23:48.023
There, my Willy,

932
01:23:48.180 --> 01:23:50.899
we have a nice
warm spot reserved for you.

933
01:23:53.431 --> 01:23:56.389
But you have to
climb into the bathtub alone.

934
01:24:13.518 --> 01:24:14.951
Shit!

935
01:24:15.101 --> 01:24:16.295
My arm.

936
01:24:16.435 --> 01:24:19.666
It's completely stiff.

937
01:24:19.894 --> 01:24:22.613
Keep moving your fingers!
At least a little.


938
01:24:22.811 --> 01:24:24.642
I can't feel anything.

939
01:24:24.811 --> 01:24:27.245
Nothing.

940
01:24:27.437 --> 01:24:29.189
It will thaw.

941
01:24:29.354 --> 01:24:31.709
Once you're sitting in front of the stove.

942
01:24:34.188 --> 01:24:35.587
Yes, you're right.

943
01:24:35.730 --> 01:24:37.561
- Just a little further.
- Yes.


944
01:24:37.980 --> 01:24:39.493
Willy, we're going to make it, OK?

945
01:24:39.647 --> 01:24:40.796
We're almost there.

946
01:25:03.651 --> 01:25:07.360
10:15 A.M. ROTE FLUH - 2,823 M

947
01:25:07.736 --> 01:25:08.964
Have you got him?

948
01:25:21.155 --> 01:25:22.224
What's wrong?

949
01:25:24.405 --> 01:25:26.157
The traverse...

950
01:25:30.865 --> 01:25:32.218
Shit!

951
01:25:32.365 --> 01:25:33.514
The rope.

952
01:25:35.574 --> 01:25:37.212
He pulled out the rope.

953
01:25:37.366 --> 01:25:40.563
He pulled out the rope.

954
01:25:44.117 --> 01:25:46.585
Shut up, Willy!

955
01:25:46.784 --> 01:25:49.218
- It's your fault we're in trouble.
- Leave him alone,


956
01:25:49.409 --> 01:25:50.967
he doesn't know what he's saying.

957
01:25:58.994 --> 01:26:00.473
I made it here.

958
01:26:00.620 --> 01:26:03.134
I'll make it back.

959
01:26:57.213 --> 01:26:59.522
C'mon, Andi.

960
01:27:21.092 --> 01:27:22.889
It's taking so long.

961
01:27:23.968 --> 01:27:27.199
Maybe they climbed past
and didn't see the ledge.


962
01:27:32.136 --> 01:27:34.092
Again!

963
01:28:31.938 --> 01:28:33.166
I'm going out again.

964
01:28:58.442 --> 01:28:59.670
We have to...

965
01:28:59.818 --> 01:29:01.854
go straight down and then...

966
01:29:02.026 --> 01:29:04.665
cross from below.

967
01:29:04.860 --> 01:29:06.976
It's our only chance.

968
01:29:07.152 --> 01:29:10.428
Who knows how far that is?

969
01:29:10.653 --> 01:29:13.087
We don't have enough rope.

970
01:29:13.278 --> 01:29:16.588
If we don't find a ledge, we're goners.

971
01:29:16.821 --> 01:29:19.016
If an avalanche comes,
we're goners here too.


972
01:29:21.071 --> 01:29:23.187
What do you mean you think so?

973
01:29:23.363 --> 01:29:24.478
Did he see her or not?

974
01:29:24.614 --> 01:29:27.287
Damn it, she's not in her room, so...

975
01:29:27.489 --> 01:29:28.558
Mr. Arau, please.

976
01:29:30.990 --> 01:29:33.584
- I need a guide immediately.
- Yes, we'll see to it.


977
01:29:35.324 --> 01:29:37.997
Put me through to Heinrich, please.

978
01:29:44.409 --> 01:29:46.843
And don't forget our package.

979
01:30:19.331 --> 01:30:20.525
Miss Fellner.

980
01:30:20.665 --> 01:30:24.055
- What are you doing here?
- My God, what happened?


981
01:30:24.291 --> 01:30:25.280
We don't know yet.

982
01:30:25.416 --> 01:30:26.531
Wait, Miss Fellner.

983
01:30:27.625 --> 01:30:28.614
Luise...

984
01:30:28.750 --> 01:30:30.308
I knew I was right about you.

985
01:30:30.792 --> 01:30:32.225
You're just like me.

986
01:30:32.375 --> 01:30:35.128
You smell the stories
before anyone else.


987
01:30:36.209 --> 01:30:37.483
Here, here, here.

988
01:30:37.626 --> 01:30:39.617
They'll be the photos of your life.

989
01:30:39.793 --> 01:30:42.512
I'm not here to take pictures.

990
01:31:34.178 --> 01:31:35.406
Belay off!

991
01:31:54.265 --> 01:31:57.098
Pass me a few pitons, I've run out!

992
01:32:04.725 --> 01:32:05.714
Avalanche.

993
01:32:12.101 --> 01:32:14.012
Release the rope!

994
01:32:15.143 --> 01:32:17.896
Get out of the gully!

995
01:32:46.940 --> 01:32:49.977
1:30 P.M.

996
01:33:43.367 --> 01:33:45.881
- Help!
- Climb up to me!


997
01:33:51.660 --> 01:33:53.855
C'mon, you can do it!

998
01:34:08.413 --> 01:34:10.085
You have to climb up.

999
01:34:10.247 --> 01:34:11.919
Further, you can do it.

1000
01:34:29.417 --> 01:34:31.135
Andi, hurry!

1001
01:34:44.253 --> 01:34:46.050
Quick, the piton is coming out.

1002
01:34:46.211 --> 01:34:47.690
The piton's coming out.

1003
01:34:52.254 --> 01:34:53.243
Quick!

1004
01:34:59.672 --> 01:35:01.151
See that you get home!

1005
01:35:01.297 --> 01:35:02.286
No!

1006
01:35:36.178 --> 01:35:43.050
I can't.
You have to come to me.


1007
01:35:43.429 --> 01:35:45.704
Eine Lawine!

1008
01:35:56.515 --> 01:35:57.948
3:00 P.M.

1009
01:35:58.099 --> 01:35:59.771
From gallery window 38,

1010
01:35:59.932 --> 01:36:04.369
if the storm doesn't blow him off the wall,
you can reach him.


1011
01:36:06.225 --> 01:36:08.181
Hans.

1012
01:36:08.350 --> 01:36:10.102
It'll never work.

1013
01:36:16.602 --> 01:36:19.400
If you take on
the wall in this weather...

1014
01:36:19.602 --> 01:36:20.591
It's your own fault.

1015
01:36:21.061 --> 01:36:22.858
We all have wives and children.

1016
01:36:30.146 --> 01:36:32.216
Is the man up there with you?

1017
01:36:36.814 --> 01:36:38.247
Yes.

1018
01:36:40.398 --> 01:36:41.831
He's with me.

1019
01:37:55.161 --> 01:37:57.391
Need crampons?

1020
01:38:03.245 --> 01:38:04.678
Son of a bitch!

1021
01:38:16.748 --> 01:38:17.737
There he is.

1022
01:38:18.415 --> 01:38:21.168
Maybe one or two rope lengths.

1023
01:38:23.749 --> 01:38:26.104
Can you hear us?

1024
01:38:28.542 --> 01:38:30.817
I'm up here.

1025
01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:32.558
Here.

1026
01:38:37.960 --> 01:38:40.190
You have to come from above,

1027
01:38:40.377 --> 01:38:41.856
through the crack.

1028
01:38:42.002 --> 01:38:44.072
What did he say?

1029
01:38:44.253 --> 01:38:46.289
I didn't quite catch it.

1030
01:38:46.503 --> 01:38:49.301
To come from above, through the crack.

1031
01:38:49.504 --> 01:38:51.096
What, with this ice?

1032
01:38:51.254 --> 01:38:54.929
- You'll never get up there.
- Yeah, I know.


1033
01:38:55.463 --> 01:38:57.772
But it might work in the crack.

1034
01:38:58.255 --> 01:39:00.405
Hang in there!

1035
01:39:11.882 --> 01:39:15.192
It's taking too long.

1036
01:39:20.426 --> 01:39:23.259
7:30 P.M.

1037
01:39:23.759 --> 01:39:26.068
It'll be night soon.

1038
01:39:26.677 --> 01:39:28.110
Yes, I noticed.

1039
01:39:40.554 --> 01:39:42.590
It's no use.

1040
01:39:43.721 --> 01:39:47.191
We have to go back immediately.

1041
01:39:47.430 --> 01:39:48.465
No.

1042
01:39:48.597 --> 01:39:50.792
No, don't go!

1043
01:39:50.973 --> 01:39:53.089
You have to come here.

1044
01:39:53.265 --> 01:39:55.142
Come up to me!

1045
01:39:55.307 --> 01:39:58.026
Please don't go now!

1046
01:39:58.224 --> 01:40:02.820
I won't last much longer.

1047
01:40:03.100 --> 01:40:04.977
Please, come up here!

1048
01:40:05.142 --> 01:40:06.780
You can't leave.

1049
01:40:06.934 --> 01:40:09.812
I don't want to die.

1050
01:40:10.018 --> 01:40:12.737
I don't want to die.

1051
01:40:30.980 --> 01:40:31.969
We're sorry.

1052
01:40:35.189 --> 01:40:37.305
He'll freeze out there.

1053
01:40:38.522 --> 01:40:39.511
Won't he?

1054
01:40:40.856 --> 01:40:43.290
No one can get
to him in this weather.

1055
01:40:43.482 --> 01:40:44.471
No one.

1056
01:40:52.442 --> 01:40:54.034
Nothing we can do.

1057
01:41:44.367 --> 01:41:47.086
9:00 P.M.

1058
01:43:31.594 --> 01:43:33.550
You won't die!

1059
01:43:35.095 --> 01:43:37.131
We'll come get you...

1060
01:43:38.637 --> 01:43:40.593
as soon as it's light out.

1061
01:43:43.430 --> 01:43:45.386
I'm here,

1062
01:43:45.555 --> 01:43:49.025
I won't leave you, Toni.

1063
01:43:55.848 --> 01:43:59.523
WEDNESDAY, JULY 22 - 8:00 AM.

1064
01:44:18.352 --> 01:44:19.990
Do you have the 60 m rope?

1065
01:44:20.144 --> 01:44:22.977
Good, he can pull
it up with a cord.

1066
01:44:24.979 --> 01:44:28.972
- Do you really think he...
- It would take hours to get up to him,


1067
01:44:29.229 --> 01:44:30.582
so he has to rappel to us.

1068
01:44:30.730 --> 01:44:33.164
- I meant...
- I know what you meant.


1069
01:44:33.355 --> 01:44:35.152
But even if he's dead,
we have to get him.


1070
01:45:15.196 --> 01:45:17.027
We're here!

1071
01:45:18.029 --> 01:45:20.145
You could use
a guardian angel like that, hm?


1072
01:45:20.322 --> 01:45:21.755
Look where she's sitting.

1073
01:45:21.905 --> 01:45:23.782
She has to get down or she'll fall!

1074
01:45:23.947 --> 01:45:26.541
If she was there all night,
she won't fall now.


1075
01:45:26.739 --> 01:45:28.138
C'mon!

1076
01:45:33.699 --> 01:45:36.293
You have to pull up a rope,

1077
01:45:36.491 --> 01:45:39.801
then you can rappel to us.

1078
01:45:40.033 --> 01:45:42.103
Do you have anything
for pulling up a rope?


1079
01:45:43.242 --> 01:45:45.437
A static cord or something?

1080
01:45:45.659 --> 01:45:50.175
I don't have any cord.

1081
01:45:51.619 --> 01:45:53.257
No cord.

1082
01:45:55.494 --> 01:45:57.212
I have no cord.

1083
01:45:58.161 --> 01:46:01.631
Can you unravel a piece of rope...

1084
01:46:01.870 --> 01:46:04.304
and tie the strands together?

1085
01:46:06.621 --> 01:46:08.896
I'll try.

1086
01:47:43.805 --> 01:47:45.397
Why is it taking so long?

1087
01:47:45.555 --> 01:47:48.115
Your beau must be half frozen by now.

1088
01:47:48.306 --> 01:47:50.695
But he'll pull through.

1089
01:47:53.390 --> 01:47:55.426
How far are you?

1090
01:47:55.599 --> 01:47:58.557
I still need a little while.

1091
01:48:17.519 --> 01:48:19.908
1:1 0 P.M.

1092
01:48:20.645 --> 01:48:24.320
Departure to the Eigerwand stations
in 15 minutes.


1093
01:48:59.860 --> 01:49:01.976
Christian, get it!

1094
01:49:18.030 --> 01:49:19.668
I've got it.

1095
01:49:27.073 --> 01:49:28.301
You can pull it up now.

1096
01:49:34.157 --> 01:49:36.625
You'll have your beau back again soon.

1097
01:49:49.452 --> 01:49:51.124
That's not sixty metres.

1098
01:49:54.494 --> 01:49:58.203
The other rope, quick!

1099
01:49:58.453 --> 01:50:01.650
The long ropes are inside on the right.
Run!


1100
01:50:04.121 --> 01:50:06.237
Please.

1101
01:50:06.413 --> 01:50:08.165
And the climbing ropes too!

1102
01:50:42.128 --> 01:50:44.961
Damn!

1103
01:50:46.795 --> 01:50:48.990
He'll have to jump the last few metres.

1104
01:50:49.170 --> 01:50:50.728
What?

1105
01:51:04.590 --> 01:51:07.821
I'm coming.

1106
01:52:33.480 --> 01:52:36.119
Toni, take the weight off it!

1107
01:52:37.481 --> 01:52:39.437
Don't give up, Toni.

1108
01:52:39.606 --> 01:52:41.005
Try, Toni.

1109
01:52:44.190 --> 01:52:45.623
Do it.

1110
01:52:45.774 --> 01:52:47.685
You can do it.

1111
01:53:07.153 --> 01:53:09.667
You have to take the weight off,

1112
01:53:09.862 --> 01:53:12.979
then it might slip through.

1113
01:53:13.195 --> 01:53:14.867
Try it, Toni!

1114
01:53:19.447 --> 01:53:21.677
He'll die.

1115
01:53:23.864 --> 01:53:24.853
Please.

1116
01:53:26.073 --> 01:53:27.552
He'll die.

1117
01:53:30.323 --> 01:53:32.791
Come back, you'll kill yourself.

1118
01:53:32.991 --> 01:53:35.710
No, secure her!

1119
01:54:04.371 --> 01:54:05.690
Try again!

1120
01:54:09.289 --> 01:54:12.042
Take the weight off!

1121
01:54:15.040 --> 01:54:16.519
C'mon.

1122
01:54:21.707 --> 01:54:24.141
Try again!

1123
01:54:34.126 --> 01:54:36.401
It's me, Luise.

1124
01:54:40.919 --> 01:54:42.352
Please.

1125
01:55:05.507 --> 01:55:07.623
Please, Toni.

1126
01:55:07.799 --> 01:55:08.788
Hang in there!

1127
01:55:15.342 --> 01:55:16.980
Grab the rope.

1128
01:55:17.134 --> 01:55:19.409
Grab it!

1129
01:55:23.010 --> 01:55:26.082
Toni, please.

1130
01:55:32.136 --> 01:55:33.489
C'mon.

1131
01:55:45.764 --> 01:55:48.881
I'm so cold.

1132
01:56:38.648 --> 01:56:40.559
Have you recovered Toni Kurz' body yet?

1133
01:56:40.732 --> 01:56:42.768
No, he's still up there.

1134
01:56:42.940 --> 01:56:44.339
Did they find the others?

1135
01:56:47.983 --> 01:56:49.336
No.

1136
01:57:10.153 --> 01:57:12.303
I'm sorry.

1137
01:57:14.487 --> 01:57:17.240
Believe me, I'm terribly sorry.

1138
01:57:17.821 --> 01:57:21.655
Listen, what I said...

1139
01:57:21.905 --> 01:57:23.577
Last night...

1140
01:57:26.114 --> 01:57:28.833
I don't want you to think I...

1141
01:57:34.408 --> 01:57:37.639
It's a terrible tragedy.

1142
01:57:37.867 --> 01:57:44.579
But Germany will never forget these men.

1143
01:57:44.951 --> 01:57:47.385
Believe me.

1144
01:57:53.536 --> 01:57:54.685
I'll take you home.

1145
01:57:56.161 --> 01:57:57.719
I'll take you back to Berlin.

1146
01:58:03.038 --> 01:58:04.517
I'm not going back to Berlin.

1147
01:58:11.539 --> 01:58:13.291
I'm not going back.

1148
01:58:19.999 --> 01:58:22.672
There are too many people
like you there.


1149
01:58:46.754 --> 01:58:48.073
All I know is...

1150
01:58:49.504 --> 01:58:52.701
that death spared me...

1151
01:58:53.755 --> 01:58:56.713
and that Toni went away forever that day.

1152
01:59:01.048 --> 01:59:05.758
One has lived if one has loved.

1153
01:59:09.758 --> 01:59:14.115
There are times when I find this
infinitely hard to believe.


1154
01:59:20.009 --> 01:59:24.958
Most days I feel that I am alive.

1155
01:59:25.260 --> 01:59:29.094
And that love is...

1156
01:59:29.344 --> 01:59:31.300
the reason for that.

1157
01:59:58.141 --> 02:00:01.099
The first ascent of the Eiger North Face
took place in 1938.


1158
02:00:01.308 --> 02:00:05.859
The German-Austrian climbing party followed
Toni Kurz and Andi Hinterstoisser's route.


1159
02:00:06.142 --> 02:00:09.612
The Nazis declared it an athletic symbol
of the recent annexation...


1160
02:00:09.851 --> 02:00:11.648
of Austria into the German Reich.

1161
02:00:11.810 --> 02:00:14.768
The "Last great problem of the Alps"
had been conquered.
