5
00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:26.870
很久很久以前,

6
00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:26.870
在一个遥远的银河中...

7
00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:39.300
星球大战

8
00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:52.340
第六章

9
00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:52.340
绝地武士归来

10
00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.180
天行者卢克回到了他的母星塔图因

11
00:00:53.180 --> 00:01:02.570
试图从大恶棍赫特族的贾巴手中
救出他的朋友  汉·索罗


12
00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.740
但是卢克并不知道

13
00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.950
帝国正秘密开始建设一个新的武装空间站

14
00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:17.170
其威力比第一颗死星还要强大

15
00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:22.380
一旦它建成
这个终极武器就将决定反抗者的命运


16
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.600
而此时
反抗者们还在为重建星际间的自由而奋斗...


17
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.020
指挥站  这里是ST-321号  通行密码为蓝色
Command station, this is ST-321. Code clearance blue.


18
00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.060
我们即将着陆  请解除护盾
We're starting our approach. Deactivate the security shield.


19
00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.900
只要我们能确认你们的密码
The security deflector shield will be deactivated...


20
00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.320
我们就会解除护盾
when we have confirmation of your code transmission.


21
00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:42.610
准备
Stand by.


22
00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.990
你们可以着陆了
You are clear to proceed.


23
00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.410
我们准备着陆
We're starting our approach.


24
00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.520
告诉指挥官维德勋爵的飞船已经抵达
Inform the commander that Lord Vader's shuttle has arrived.


25
00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:19.730
长官
Sir.


26
00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:59.610
维德勋爵  见到您真是意外之喜  我们深感荣幸
Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure. We're honoured.


27
00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:02.030
你可以省掉这种客套了  指挥官阁下
You may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander.


28
00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.650
我来此是监督你们按期办事的
I'm here to put you back on schedule.


29
00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.820
我向您保证  维德勋爵  我的人正全力工作
I assure you, Lord Vader, my men are working as fast as they can.


30
00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:11.370
那也许我能找到个新方法让他们更努力
Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.


31
00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:15.660
如我所说  整个空间站将如期投入使用
I tell you this station will be operational as planned.


32
00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:21.750
皇帝陛下对局势的评估可没有你这么乐观
The emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.


33
00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:25.090
但是他所要求的是不可能的  我需要更多的人
But he asks the impossible. I need more men.


34
00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:28.340
那等他驾临的时候  也许你也能向他这么回奏
Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives.


35
00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.100
- 皇帝陛下会驾临此地? - 完全正确  指挥官阁下...
- The emperor's coming here? - That is correct, Commander...


36
00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:37.980
而且他肯定会对你工作缺乏进展深感不满
and he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress.


37
00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:40.570
我们将加倍努力
We shall double our efforts.


38
00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:43.980
我希望如此  指挥官阁下  这也是为了你好
I hope so, Commander, for your sake.


39
00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.980
皇帝陛下可不会像我一样宽容大度
The emperor is not as forgiving as I am.


40
00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.390
我当然担心  你也该担心啊
Of course I'm worried. And you should be too.


41
00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.300
兰多·卡尔瑞辛和可怜的楚巴卡不会从这个差劲的地方回来了
Lando Calrissian and poor Chewbacca never returned from this awful place.


42
00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:16.720
别这么肯定
Don't be so sure.


43
00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.150
我要是把赫特族的贾巴的事情告诉你一半
If I told you half the things I've heard about this Jabba the Hutt...


44
00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.150
你就得短路
you'd probably short-circuit.


45
00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:36.710
R2  你肯定他们就在这吗?
R2, are you sure this is the right place?


46
00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.970
我想我还是敲门比较好
I'd better knock, I suppose.


47
00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:49.720
好像这里没什么人  我们回去告诉卢克主人吧
There doesn't seem to be anyone here. Let's go back and tell Master Luke.


48
00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:55.220
天啊!
Goodness gracious me!


49
00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:20.870
我想他们是不会让我们进去的  R2
I don't think they're going to let us in, R2.


50
00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.630
我们还是走吧
We'd better go.


51
00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:35.310
R2  等一下
R2, wait.


52
00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:39.190
哦  天啊  R2
Oh, dear. R2.


53
00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:42.610
R2  我坚信我们不该这么冒然闯入的
R2, I really don't think we should rush into all this.


54
00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:45.700
哦  R2!
Oh, R2!


55
00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:47.400
R2  等等我!
R2, wait for me!


56
00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:58.120
你就把卢克主人的口信告诉他们然后我们就走吧!
Just you deliver Master Luke's message and get us out of here.


57
00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.210
哦  天啊!
Oh, my!


58
00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:05.290
哦  不!
Oh, no.


59
00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:11.850
哦  天啊!
Oh, my.


60
00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:19.690
我们给你的主人  赫特族的贾巴带来个口信
We bring a message to your master,Jabba the Hutt.


61
00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:25.610
还有一件礼物
And a gift.


62
00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:27.070
什么礼物?
What gift?


63
00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:48.800
他说我们只能告诉贾巴本人
He says that our instructions are to give it only to Jabba himself.


64
00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:02.400
我很抱歉  不过我想他对这种事情从来就是这么固执的
I'm terribly sorry. I'm afraid he's ever so stubborn about these sort of things.


65
00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:08.240
R2  我对此有个不好的预感
R2, I have a bad feeling about this.


66
00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:44.900
早上好
Good morning.


67
00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:52.410
口信  R2  口信呢
The message, R2. The message.


68
00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:04.140
尊贵的阁下  谨致以崇高的敬意
Greetings, Exalted One.


69
00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.550
请允许我介绍自己
Allow me to introduce myself.


70
00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:10.550
我是天行者卢克  绝地武士  索罗船长的朋友
I am Luke Skywalker, Jedi knight and friend to Captain Solo.


71
00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:14.020
我知道你是伟大强悍的贾巴...
I know that you are powerful, mighty Jabba...


72
00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:17.810
我也理解你对索罗也一定怒气冲天
and that your anger with Solo must be equally powerful.


73
00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:21.730
我期望阁下可以听听我的建议  看什么可以用来交换索罗的生命
I seek an audience with Your Greatness to bargain for Solo's life.


74
00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:28.160
以您的智慧  我相信我们一定可以找到一个方案
With your wisdom, I'm sure we can work out an arrangement...


75
00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:30.000
对我们都有利
which will be mutually beneficial...


76
00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:32.790
而且可以避免我们之间发生不愉快的冲突
and enable us to avoid any unpleasant confrontation.


77
00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:38.090
为了表示我的善意  我有一份礼物送给您
As a token of my goodwill, I present to you a gift-


78
00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:39.960
就是这两个机器人
these two droids.


79
00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:41.970
他说什么?
What did he say?


80
00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:45.630
他们都很勤劳  会好好替你服务的
Both are hard-working and will serve you well.


81
00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:49.510
这不可能  R2  你肯定放错消息了
This can't be. R2, you're playing the wrong message.


82
00:09:56.110 --> 00:09:57.900
他不是绝地武士
He's no Jedi.


83
00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:04.360
没什么交易好谈的
There will be no bargain.


84
00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:06.700
我们死定了
We're doomed.


85
00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:13.790
我不会放弃我最喜欢的装饰品的
I will not give up my favourite decoration.


86
00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:18.710
我喜欢索罗船长待在这里
I like Captain Solo where he is.


87
00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:22.500
R2  看  索罗船长
R2, look. Captain Solo.


88
00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:25.170
他还在被碳化冷冻着
And he's still frozen in carbonite.


89
00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:40.770
卢克主人到底是怎么回事?
What could possibly have come over Master Luke?


90
00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:43.200
是我做错什么事了吗?
Was it something I did?


91
00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:45.770
他从来没有对我的工作表示什么不满啊
He never expressed any unhappiness with my work.


92
00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:48.450
这太可怕了
How horrid!


93
00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:19.690
不错啊  新货色
Good. New acquisitions.


94
00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:22.440
你是个礼仪机器人  对吧?
You are a protocol droid, are you not?


95
00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:24.480
我是C-3PO...
I am C-3PO-


96
00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:26.360
回答是或不是
Yes or no will do.


97
00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:27.990
那  是的
Well, yes.


98
00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:30.610
你会说多少种语言?
How many languages do you speak?


99
00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:34.370
我可以流利使用超过六百万种交流方式  而且可以...
I am fluent in over six million forms of communication and can readily...


100
00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:37.120
好极了  我们已经好久没有翻译了
Splendid. We have been without an interpreter...


101
00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:40.590
上个礼仪机器人得罪了我们的主人...
since our master got angry with our last protocol droid...


102
00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:42.510
然后被分解了
and disintegrated him.


103
00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:44.210
分解?
Disintegrated?


104
00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:52.930
警卫  这个礼仪机器人可能有用
Guard, this protocol droid might be useful.


105
00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:55.220
给他装上防逃螺栓
Fit him with a restraining bolt...


106
00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:58.690
然后带他去大人的剧场去
and take him back up to His Excellency's main audience chamber.


107
00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:01.280
R2  别离开我!
R2, don't leave me!


108
00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:08.570
你这个坏脾气的小家伙
You're a feisty little one...


109
00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:11.160
你马上就会懂得什么叫尊重了
but you'll soon learn some respect.


110
00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:14.580
我要你去主人的游船那里去
I have need for you on the master's sail barge...


111
00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:17.420
我想你在那里会很合适
and I think you'll fill in nicely.


112
00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:49.400
啊!再表演一次!
Ah! Do that again!


113
00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:46.990
我来领这个伍基族人的赏金
I have come for the bounty on this Wookiee.


114
00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:49.370
哦  不  楚巴卡
Oh, no. Chewbacca.


115
00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:57.670
至少我们抓住了强大的楚巴卡
At last we have the mighty Chewbacca.


116
00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:06.260
我在这里  尊敬的主人
Yes, I am here, Your Worshipfulness.


117
00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:08.710
有何吩咐?
Yes?


118
00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:19.940
光荣的贾巴对你表示欢迎...
The illustrious Jabba bids you welcome...


119
00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:22.640
并很高兴付你二万五千元酬劳
and will gladly pay you the reward of 25,000.


120
00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:25.740
我要五万  一分不能少
I want 50,000. No less.


121
00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:28.530
"五万  一分不能少"
"50,000. No less. "


122
00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:43.170
我说什么了?
What did I say?


123
00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:52.180
伟大的贾巴问为什么他要付五万
The mighty Jabba asks why he must pay 50,000.


124
00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:58.480
因为他带了一个热核引爆器
Because he's holding a thermal detonator.


125
00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:14.330
这个赏金猎人和我一样
This bounty hunter is my kind of scum...


126
00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:18.080
无所畏惧而又富有创新精神
fearless and inventive.


127
00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:30.350
贾巴愿意付三万五
Jabba offers the sum of 35...


128
00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:32.640
我建议你接受
and I do suggest you take it.


129
00:16:38.190 --> 00:16:39.820
他同意了!
He agrees!


130
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.410
先休息一下
Just relax for a moment.


131
00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:35.160
你从碳化冷冻中被解救出来了
You're free of the carbonite.


132
00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:40.710
不过你还有休眠反应
You have hibernation sickness.


133
00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:45.300
- 我看不见 - 你的视力会恢复的
- I can't see. - Your eyesight will return in time.


134
00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:48.720
- 我在哪里? - 贾巴的宫殿
- Where am I? - Jabba's palace.


135
00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:53.650
你是谁?
Who are you?


136
00:19:58.650 --> 00:20:01.110
- 一个爱你的人 - 莉娅
- Someone who loves you. - Leia.


137
00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:06.610
我得救你出去
I gotta get you out of here.


138
00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:11.070
那是什么声音?
What's that?


139
00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:15.710
我听过这个笑声
I know that laugh.


140
00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:22.960
嘿  贾巴
Hey,Jabba.


141
00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:25.930
听我说  贾巴  我正要付给你钱
Look,Jabba, I was just on my way to pay you back.


142
00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:28.930
只是有事耽搁了我一下  这不是我的错
I got a little sidetracked. It's not my fault.


143
00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:32.760
太晚了  索罗
It's too late for that, Solo.


144
00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:37.610
你本来可以是一个很好的走私客的...
You may have been a good smuggler...


145
00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:41.190
但是你现在只能做本莎兽的饲料
but now you're Bantha fodder.


146
00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:46.820
听我说...
Look-


147
00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:50.160
把他带走
Take him away.


148
00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:52.030
贾巴  我会给你三倍的钱
Jabba, I'll pay you triple.


149
00:20:52.170 --> 00:20:54.660
你干嘛要凭白放弃一大笔钱呢  别犯傻
You're throwing away a fortune here. Don't be a fool.


150
00:20:57.590 --> 00:20:59.750
把她带上来
Bring her to me.


151
00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:05.840
我们有强大的朋友
We have powerful friends.


152
00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:08.210
你会后悔这么做的
You're gonna regret this.


153
00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:11.980
我相信
I'm sure.


154
00:21:16.030 --> 00:21:17.850
我看不下去了
I can't bear to watch.


155
00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:33.920
楚伊?（楚巴卡的昵称）
Chewie?


156
00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:37.670
楚伊?是你吗?
Chewie, is that you?


157
00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:42.210
等一下  我看不见
Wait a minute. I can't see, pal.


158
00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:45.210
这怎么回事?
What's going on?


159
00:21:47.770 --> 00:21:49.340
卢克?卢克疯了
Luke? Luke's crazy.


160
00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:53.010
他连自己都照顾不好  还想救别人
He can't even take care of himself, much less rescue anybody.


161
00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:56.770
他成了绝地武士?
A Jedi knight?


162
00:21:57.650 --> 00:21:59.540
我有一阵子和外界没什么联系了
I'm out of it for a little while,


163
00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:01.440
怎么每个人都幻想自己变成伟大人物了
everybody gets delusions of grandeur.


164
00:22:04.910 --> 00:22:06.780
我还好  朋友
I'm all right, pal.


165
00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:10.200
我还好
I'm all right.


166
00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:06.170
我一定要和贾巴谈谈
I must speak with Jabba.


167
00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:13.350
没什么交易好谈的
No bargain.


168
00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:15.940
你现在带我去见贾巴
You will take me to Jabba now.


169
00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:22.200
好好替你的主人服务
You serve your master well.


170
00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:26.070
你会得到丰厚奖赏的
And you will be rewarded.


171
00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:38.210
终于来了  卢克主人终于来救我了
At last! Master Luke's come to rescue me.


172
00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:39.750
主人
Master.


173
00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:44.930
天行者卢克  绝地武士
Luke Skywalker, Jedi knight.


174
00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:49.300
我告诉你不要让他进来的
I told you not to admit him.


175
00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:51.230
我必须要和你谈谈
I must be allowed to speak.


176
00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:54.110
他必须要和你谈谈
He must be allowed to speak.


177
00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:57.890
你这个精神脆弱的笨蛋!
You weak-minded fool!


178
00:23:59.950 --> 00:24:04.280
他只不过用绝地武士那套精神控制的老把戏而已
He's using an old Jedi mind trick.


179
00:24:04.410 --> 00:24:07.860
你会把索罗船长和伍基族的人交给我
You will bring Captain Solo and the Wookiee to me.


180
00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:19.000
你的精神力量对我无效  小子
Your mind powers will not work on me, boy.


181
00:24:19.130 --> 00:24:21.290
没关系...
Nevertheless...


182
00:24:21.430 --> 00:24:24.380
我要带走索罗船长和他的朋友
I'm taking Captain Solo and his friends.


183
00:24:24.510 --> 00:24:28.350
你或者把他们卖给我赚钱  或者我把你干掉
You can either profit by this or be destroyed.


184
00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:31.430
你自己掂量着办  不过我要警告你别低估我的能力
It's your choice, but I warn you not to underestimate my powers.


185
00:24:33.690 --> 00:24:35.770
卢克主人  你正站在...
Master Luke, you're standing on-


186
00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:40.480
没什么交易好谈的  小绝地武士
There will be no bargain, young Jedi.


187
00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:45.230
我会很高兴看到你怎么死掉的
I shall enjoy watching you die.


188
00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:18.890
哦  不!仇恨兽!
Oh, no! The rancor!


189
00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:09.910
把索罗和伍基族的那家伙给我带来
Bring me Solo and the Wookiee.


190
00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:14.250
他们会为这暴行付出代价的
They will all suffer for this outrage.


191
00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:30.140
汉
Han.


192
00:28:33.690 --> 00:28:36.890
- 你还好吗? - 很好  我们又在一起了  对吧?
- Are you all right? - Fine. Together again, huh?


193
00:28:37.030 --> 00:28:39.430
- 我可不想 - 我们现在情况如何?
- Wouldn't miss it. - How are we doin'?


194
00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:42.240
- 还是老样子 - 有那么差吗?
- Same as always. - That bad, huh?


195
00:28:42.370 --> 00:28:44.860
- 莉娅在哪里? - 我在这里
- Where's Leia? - I'm here.


196
00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:49.960
哦  亲爱的
Oh, dear.


197
00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:53.920
尊贵的主人  伟大的赫特族的贾巴...
His High Exaltedness, the great Jabba the Hutt...


198
00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:57.080
已经饬令对你们立即处以死刑
has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately.


199
00:28:57.210 --> 00:28:58.840
很好  我不喜欢长时间的等待
Good. I hate long waits.


200
00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:03.830
因此你们将被带到沙丘海...
You will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea...


201
00:29:03.970 --> 00:29:06.300
投入卡库恩洞穴之中
and cast into the Pit of Carkoon...


202
00:29:06.430 --> 00:29:08.720
那里居住着强大的沙列克
nesting place of the all-powerful Sarlacc.


203
00:29:08.850 --> 00:29:10.050
听起来不算太差
Doesn't sound so bad.


204
00:29:10.190 --> 00:29:14.050
在他肚子里面你们会更明白什么叫做受难和痛苦
In his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering...


205
00:29:14.190 --> 00:29:17.270
因为你们将会在超过1000年中被缓慢消化
as you are slowly digested over 1,000 years.


206
00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:20.900
我又想了一下  让我们这么说吧
On second thought, let's pass on that.


207
00:29:21.030 --> 00:29:22.660
你还是该接受我们的交易  贾巴
You should have bargained,Jabba.


208
00:29:26.490 --> 00:29:28.950
这会是你犯的最后一个错误了
That's the last mistake you'll ever make.


209
00:30:20.510 --> 00:30:22.220
我觉得我的眼睛好多了
I think my eyes are getting better.


210
00:30:22.340 --> 00:30:25.460
以前是一大片黑暗  现在是一大片光明
Instead of a big dark blur, I see a big light blur.


211
00:30:26.350 --> 00:30:29.520
没什么好看的  我曾经住在这里  你知道的
There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know.


212
00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:32.480
你也要死在这里了  倒是挺合适
You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient.


213
00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:34.890
靠楚伊和兰多近点
Just stick close to Chewie and Lando.


214
00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:37.350
我已经把一切都处理好啦
I've taken care of everything.


215
00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:39.520
好的很
Great.


216
00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:49.990
很快你就学着感激我了
Soon you will learn to appreciate me.


217
00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:53.200
我很抱歉
I'm terribly sorry.


218
00:30:53.330 --> 00:30:56.250
R2  你在这里干嘛?
R2, what are you doing here?


219
00:30:56.380 --> 00:30:59.420
我知道你在这里送饮料  但是这里可危险的很
I can see you're serving drinks, but this place is dangerous.


220
00:30:59.550 --> 00:31:01.030
他们要处决卢克主人了
They're going to execute Master Luke,


221
00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:02.500
如果我们不当心点  我们也得完蛋
and if we're not careful, us too.


222
00:31:05.390 --> 00:31:07.300
我真希望我也能像你那么自信
I wish I had your confidence.


223
00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:32.830
沙列克的祭品们
Victims of the almighty Sarlacc...


224
00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:36.080
尊贵的主人希望你们能死的有尊严
His Excellency hopes that you will die honourably.


225
00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:40.540
不过如果你们之中谁要请求他的宽恕
But should any of you wish to beg for mercy...


226
00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:44.670
伟大的赫特族的贾巴现在将聆听你们的恳求
the great Jabba the Hutt will now listen to your pleas.


227
00:31:48.890 --> 00:31:54.230
3PO  你告诉他那个大混蛋

228
00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:56.980
他不会从我们这里得到这种满足的
he'll get no such pleasure from us!


229
00:31:57.110 --> 00:31:58.900
对吧?
Right?


230
00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:04.270
贾巴  这是你最后的机会了
This is your last chance.


231
00:32:04.410 --> 00:32:06.490
放我们走  不然就去死
Free us or die.


232
00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:13.740
把他带到那里去
Move him into position.


233
00:32:37.940 --> 00:32:40.190
推他进去
Put him in.


234
00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:06.100
小心点  楚伊
Easy, Chewie.


235
00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:17.530
救命!
Help!


236
00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:26.490
楚伊  你被击中了?伤在哪里?
Chewie, you're hit? Where is it?


237
00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:34.040
汉  楚伊!
Han, Chewie!


238
00:33:34.170 --> 00:33:35.200
兰多
Lando.


239
00:33:43.390 --> 00:33:44.630
博巴·费特?
Boba Fett?


240
00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:48.090
博巴·费特?在哪?
Boba Fett? Where?


241
00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:23.290
- 兰多  抓住它! - 再低点!
- Lando, grab it! - Lower it!


242
00:34:23.430 --> 00:34:24.800
我正在努力呢!
I'm trying!


243
00:34:46.950 --> 00:34:49.360
抓住我  楚伊  抓住!
Grab me, Chewie. Grab it!


244
00:35:02.090 --> 00:35:04.340
抓住他  就差一点了  你马上就碰到它了
Grab it. Almost. You almost got it.


245
00:35:13.730 --> 00:35:15.060
轻点
Gently, now.


246
00:35:15.190 --> 00:35:17.230
轻点  抓住我  楚伊
Easy. Hold me, Chewie.


247
00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:30.540
楚伊  给我枪
Chewie, give me the gun.


248
00:35:30.670 --> 00:35:33.670
- 兰多  别动 - 等等!你不是看不见吗!
- Don't move, Lando. - Wait! I thought you were blind!


249
00:35:33.790 --> 00:35:35.790
我现在视力好多了  别动
I can see a lot better. Don't move.


250
00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:37.460
再瞄高点!
A little higher!


251
00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:42.630
楚伊  拉我们上去
Chewie, pull us up.


252
00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:45.300
拉啊  楚伊  拉
Up, Chewie. Up.


253
00:35:47.140 --> 00:35:48.720
我们要离开这里
We gotta get out of here.


254
00:35:49.430 --> 00:35:51.230
别碰我的眼睛!R2  救救我!
Not my eyes! R2, help!


255
00:35:52.350 --> 00:35:53.270
快点  R2!
Quickly, R2!


256
00:35:54.820 --> 00:35:55.850
野兽!
Beast!


257
00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:03.070
去炮那里!
Get the gun!


258
00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:04.440
瞄向甲板
Point it at the deck.


259
00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:11.540
瞄向甲板!
Point it at the deck!


260
00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:17.880
R2  我们去哪里?我可能不能...
R2, where are we going? I couldn't possibly-


261
00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:24.550
过来
Come on.


262
00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:35.060
- 我们离开这里吧  别忘了机器人 - 我们上路了
- Let's go. Don't forget the droids. - We're on our way.


263
00:37:14.610 --> 00:37:16.350
我在舰队这里等你
I'll meet you back at the fleet.


264
00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:19.110
快点  联盟军现在应该已经集合了
Hurry. The Alliance should be assembled by now.


265
00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:21.910
- 我会的 - 卢克  谢谢你
- I will. - Luke, thanks.


266
00:37:22.030 --> 00:37:25.280
谢谢你来救我  我欠你一命
Thanks for coming after me. Now I owe you one.


267
00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.410
没错  R2  我们现在去达古巴星系
That's right, R2. We're going to the Dagobah system.


268
00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:42.080
我向一个老友保证要去
I have a promise to keep...


269
00:37:42.220 --> 00:37:44.180
现在我得去实践我的诺言
to an old friend.


270
00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:36.820
平身  我的朋友
Rise, my friend.


271
00:38:43.530 --> 00:38:46.780
死星将如期完成
The Death Star will be completed on schedule.


272
00:38:47.580 --> 00:38:50.070
你干的不错  维德勋爵
You've done well, Lord Vader.


273
00:38:50.210 --> 00:38:56.040
现在我感觉你想继续寻找年轻的天行者
Now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker.


274
00:38:58.510 --> 00:38:59.920
是的  我的主人
Yes, my master.


275
00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:03.340
耐心点  我的朋友
Patience, my friend.


276
00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:06.800
到时候  他会来找你的
In time, he will seek you out.


277
00:39:06.930 --> 00:39:11.350
等他来的时候  你一定要把他带到我的面前
When he does, you must bring him before me.


278
00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:13.770
他已经变强了
He has grown strong.


279
00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:19.570
只有我们一起才能把他拉到"原力"的黑暗面来
Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force.


280
00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:21.440
如您所愿
As you wish.


281
00:39:23.070 --> 00:39:27.070
所有事情都如同我预见的一样进行
Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen.


282
00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:55.350
你那是什么表情
That face you make-


283
00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:58.980
觉得我太老了?
Look I so old to young eyes?


284
00:39:59.110 --> 00:40:00.860
不  当然不是
No, of course not.


285
00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:03.910
我老了
I do.


286
00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:08.990
我确实老了
Yes, I do.


287
00:40:11.170 --> 00:40:13.660
疾病缠身
Sick have I become.


288
00:40:13.790 --> 00:40:15.750
又老又虚弱
Old and weak.


289
00:40:20.430 --> 00:40:22.330
等你九百岁的时候
When 900 years old you reach...


290
00:40:22.470 --> 00:40:24.300
你也好不到哪里去
look as good you will not.


291
00:40:31.190 --> 00:40:33.310
我很快就会休息了
Soon will I rest.


292
00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:36.560
是的  彻底的安息
Yes. Forever sleep.


293
00:40:38.190 --> 00:40:39.820
这是我应得的结局
Earned it I have.


294
00:40:39.950 --> 00:40:42.620
尤达大师  你不能死啊
Master Yoda, you can't die.


295
00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:46.870
尽管我的"原力"很强大...
Strong am I with the Force...


296
00:40:46.990 --> 00:40:48.950
可是我身体已经不行了
but not that strong.


297
00:40:51.670 --> 00:40:56.790
双星即将降临  很快夜晚就要来到
Twilight is upon me, and soon night must fall.


298
00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:02.380
这就是世界之道
That is the way of things...


299
00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:06.720
"原力"之道
the way of the Force.


300
00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:10.520
但是我需要你的帮助
But I need your help.


301
00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:13.810
我来此是要完成我的训练的
I've come back to complete the training.


302
00:41:13.940 --> 00:41:16.060
你不需要什么训练了
No more training do you require.


303
00:41:16.190 --> 00:41:19.310
你需要的你已经都知道了
Already know you that which you need.


304
00:41:22.450 --> 00:41:24.690
那我已经是绝地武士了
Then I am a Jedi.


305
00:41:31.620 --> 00:41:33.280
还不是
Not yet.


306
00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:35.410
还差一件事情
One thing remains-


307
00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:40.880
维德  你必须对抗维德
Vader. You must confront Vader.


308
00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:45.810
那时  只有那时  你才成为一名绝地武士
Then...only then... a Jedi will you be.


309
00:41:47.560 --> 00:41:49.680
而你会对抗他的
And confront him you will.


310
00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:55.820
尤达大师...
Master Yoda...


311
00:41:59.570 --> 00:42:01.980
达斯·维德是我父亲吗?
is Darth Vader my father?


312
00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:07.610
我需要休息
Rest I need.


313
00:42:07.750 --> 00:42:09.160
是的
Yes.


314
00:42:09.290 --> 00:42:10.910
休息
Rest.


315
00:42:12.750 --> 00:42:14.790
尤达  我必须知道
Yoda, I must know.


316
00:42:19.130 --> 00:42:21.290
他是你的父亲
Your father he is.


317
00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:30.140
他告诉你了  对吧?
Told you, did he?


318
00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:33.270
是的
Yes.


319
00:42:35.110 --> 00:42:37.400
真没想到
Unexpected this is.


320
00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:40.810
太不幸了
And unfortunate.


321
00:42:42.620 --> 00:42:44.660
很不幸我知道了事实?
Unfortunate that I know the truth?


322
00:42:44.780 --> 00:42:46.060
不
No.


323
00:42:49.290 --> 00:42:53.200
很不幸你那么早面对他...
Unfortunate that you rushed to face him...


324
00:42:53.330 --> 00:42:55.870
你的训练还没有结束
that incomplete was your training...


325
00:42:56.960 --> 00:43:00.460
对你要承担的重任还没做好准备
that not ready for the burden were you.


326
00:43:02.470 --> 00:43:04.090
对不起
I'm sorry.


327
00:43:05.310 --> 00:43:10.810
记住  绝地武士的力量来自于"原力"
Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force.


328
00:43:15.860 --> 00:43:17.600
但是要小心
But beware.


329
00:43:17.740 --> 00:43:21.270
愤怒  恐惧  好战...
Anger, fear, aggression...


330
00:43:21.410 --> 00:43:24.030
这些都是黑暗的一面
the dark side are they.


331
00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:28.490
一旦你踏上了黑暗之路...
Once you start down the dark path...


332
00:43:28.620 --> 00:43:32.370
你就永远无法回头了
forever will it dominate your destiny.


333
00:43:39.630 --> 00:43:41.380
不要...
Do not-


334
00:43:44.470 --> 00:43:48.970
千万不要低估皇帝的力量...
Do not underestimate the powers of the emperor...


335
00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:53.510
不然你会落得和你父亲一样的命运
or suffer your father's fate you will.


336
00:43:57.990 --> 00:44:00.030
等我死去了...
When gone am I...


337
00:44:00.910 --> 00:44:03.990
你将是最后一个绝地武士
the last of the Jedi will you be.


338
00:44:08.500 --> 00:44:12.580
你们家族的人对于原力都很有天份
The Force runs strong in your family.


339
00:44:15.090 --> 00:44:18.670
把你所学的传于后世
Pass on what you have learned.


340
00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:30.310
那就将会有...
There is...


341
00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:33.140
另一个...
another...


342
00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:41.650
天行者
Skywalker.


343
00:45:42.470 --> 00:45:44.340
我没法办到  R2
I can't do it, R2.


344
00:45:48.230 --> 00:45:50.630
我无法独自前行
I can't go on alone.


345
00:45:50.770 --> 00:45:52.930
尤达永远与你同在
Yoda will always be with you.


346
00:45:54.020 --> 00:45:55.220
欧比·旺
Obi-Wan.


347
00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:04.910
你为什么不告诉我?
Why didn't you tell me?


348
00:46:05.030 --> 00:46:08.900
你对我说维德背叛和谋杀了我的父亲
You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father.


349
00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:14.540
你的父亲被"原力"的黑暗面所吸引
Your father was seduced by the dark side of the Force.


350
00:46:14.670 --> 00:46:18.580
然后他就不再是天行者安纳金  而变成了达斯·维德
He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader.


351
00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:20.210
当此事发生之时...
When that happened...


352
00:46:20.340 --> 00:46:23.510
那个曾经是好人的你的父亲就被毁灭了
the good man who was your father was destroyed.


353
00:46:24.550 --> 00:46:26.960
所以从某种角度来说
So what I told you was true...


354
00:46:27.100 --> 00:46:28.930
我告诉你的是事实
from a certain point of view.


355
00:46:29.060 --> 00:46:31.520
某种角度?
A certain point of view?


356
00:46:31.650 --> 00:46:35.510
卢克  你将会发现  我们坚信的很多事实
Luke, you're going to find that many of the truths we cling to...


357
00:46:35.650 --> 00:46:38.570
极大程度上都源于我们自己看问题的角度
depend greatly on our own point of view.


358
00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:42.070
安纳金是一个好朋友
Anakin was a good friend.


359
00:46:43.030 --> 00:46:44.610
当我第一次见到他时...
When I first knew him...


360
00:46:44.740 --> 00:46:46.900
你父亲已经是一个伟大的飞行员...
your father was already a great pilot...


361
00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:50.660
但我对于他身上的"原力"那么强大无比惊讶
but I was amazed how strongly the Force was with him.


362
00:46:50.790 --> 00:46:54.740
于是我亲自把他训练成为一名绝地武士
I took it upon myself to train him as a Jedi.


363
00:46:54.880 --> 00:46:58.790
我以为我可以把他教导的如同尤达一样好
I thought that I could instruct him just as well as Yoda.


364
00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:00.200
但是我错了
I was wrong.


365
00:47:01.180 --> 00:47:03.050
他身上还有善良存在
There is still good in him.


366
00:47:03.180 --> 00:47:05.930
他现在更多的是一部机器  而不是人
He's more machine now than man...


367
00:47:06.060 --> 00:47:08.010
他扭曲而邪恶
twisted and evil.


368
00:47:09.770 --> 00:47:11.980
我办不到  本
I can't do it, Ben.


369
00:47:12.100 --> 00:47:14.010
你不能逃避你自己的命运
You cannot escape your destiny.


370
00:47:14.150 --> 00:47:17.400
你一定要再次面对达斯·维德
You must face Darth Vader again.


371
00:47:17.530 --> 00:47:20.310
我不能杀掉自己的亲生父亲
I can't kill my own father.


372
00:47:23.570 --> 00:47:26.660
那皇帝已经赢了
Then the emperor has already won.


373
00:47:27.700 --> 00:47:29.950
你是我们唯一的希望了
You were our only hope.


374
00:47:31.250 --> 00:47:33.370
尤达提到了另外一个
Yoda spoke of another.


375
00:47:35.420 --> 00:47:37.990
他提到的另外一个是你的孪生姐妹
The other he spoke of is your twin sister.


376
00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:40.880
但是我没有姐妹
But I have no sister.


377
00:47:42.010 --> 00:47:43.920
为了保护你们不受皇帝的迫害
To protect you both from the emperor...


378
00:47:44.050 --> 00:47:47.640
你们一出生  就瞒住了你父亲
you were hidden from your father when you were born.


379
00:47:47.770 --> 00:47:50.220
如同我一样  皇帝也知道
The emperor knew, as I did...


380
00:47:50.350 --> 00:47:54.050
如果安纳金有任何后代
if Anakin were to have any offspring...


381
00:47:54.190 --> 00:47:56.730
他们将成为对他的威胁
they would be a threat to him.


382
00:47:56.860 --> 00:48:02.150
这就是为什么你的姐妹要安全的匿名生活
That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous.


383
00:48:04.700 --> 00:48:08.650
- 莉娅是我的姐妹 - 你的直觉很准确
- Leia is my sister. - Your insight serves you well.


384
00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:12.830
把你的感情埋在心底吧  卢克
Bury your feelings deep down, Luke.


385
00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:15.330
它们会为你服务
They do you credit...


386
00:48:15.460 --> 00:48:18.550
但是它们也会为帝国皇帝所利用
but they could be made to serve the emperor.


387
00:48:41.030 --> 00:48:43.700
看看你啊  成了将军了  啊?
Look at you. A general, huh?


388
00:48:43.820 --> 00:48:46.910
肯定有人告诉他们我在塔纳战役中的杰出表现了
Someone must have told them about my manoeuvre at the Battle of Tanaab.


389
00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:49.910
别看我啊  朋友  我只是和他们说你是个不错的飞行员而已
Don't look at me, pal. I just said you were a fair pilot.


390
00:48:50.040 --> 00:48:52.990
我不知道他们是要找人来指挥这个疯狂攻击的
I didn't know they were looking for somebody to lead this crazy attack.


391
00:48:53.130 --> 00:48:55.250
我只是很奇怪他们没有让你来做这事
I'm surprised they didn't ask you to do it.


392
00:48:56.130 --> 00:48:58.090
谁说他们没有  只是我没有那么疯狂而已
Who says they didn't? But I ain't crazy.


393
00:48:58.210 --> 00:49:00.010
你可是名人啊  记得吗?
You're the respectable one, remember?


394
00:49:08.350 --> 00:49:11.300
皇帝犯了一个重大错误  现在轮到我们攻击了
The emperor's made a critical error and the time for our attack has come.


395
00:49:12.100 --> 00:49:15.970
伯森间谍们给我提供的数据标明了...
The data brought to us by the Bothan spies pinpoint the exact location...


396
00:49:16.110 --> 00:49:18.230
帝国新战斗基地的准确位置
of the emperor's new battle station.


397
00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:20.150
我们同时得知死星上的...
We also know that the weapon systems...


398
00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:22.520
武器系统还不能正常工作
of this Death Star are not yet operational.


399
00:49:22.660 --> 00:49:25.610
而整个帝国舰队散布于银河之中
With the imperial fleet spread throughout the galaxy...


400
00:49:25.740 --> 00:49:27.240
徒劳的寻找我们
in a vain effort to engage us...


401
00:49:27.370 --> 00:49:29.240
因此它现在基本上是不设防的
it is relatively unprotected.


402
00:49:29.370 --> 00:49:31.410
而最关键的是...
But most important of all...


403
00:49:32.330 --> 00:49:34.240
我们得知皇帝本人...
we've learned that the emperor himself...


404
00:49:34.380 --> 00:49:36.500
现在正在亲自视察...
is personally overseeing the final stages...


405
00:49:36.630 --> 00:49:39.090
死星建造的最后阶段
of the construction of this Death Star.


406
00:49:39.970 --> 00:49:44.430
为了给我们提供这个消息  很多伯森人牺牲了
Many Bothans died to bring us this information.


407
00:49:46.970 --> 00:49:48.300
阿克巴司令  请
Admiral Ackbar, please.


408
00:49:48.430 --> 00:49:53.560
你们这里看到的就是死星围绕恩多星的布满森林的卫星旋转
You can see here the Death Star orbiting the forest moon of Endor.


409
00:49:53.690 --> 00:49:59.150
尽管死星上的武器系统还不能正常工作
Although the weapon systems on this Death Star are not yet operational...


410
00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:02.780
死星本身还是有很强的防御机制
the Death Star does have a strong defence mechanism.


411
00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:06.360
它被一层能量盾保护着
It is protected by an energy shield...


412
00:50:06.490 --> 00:50:10.110
而这个能量盾是在恩多的那颗卫星上产生的
which is generated from the nearby forest moon of Endor.


413
00:50:15.750 --> 00:50:19.500
在我们尝试任何攻击之前  护盾必须要被解除
The shield must be deactivated if any attack is to be attempted.


414
00:50:20.930 --> 00:50:24.840
一旦护盾被解除  我们的巡洋舰将建立一道环行防线...
Once the shield is down, our cruisers will create a perimeter...


415
00:50:24.970 --> 00:50:27.890
而战斗机将飞进这个超级建筑
while the fighters fly into the superstructure...


416
00:50:28.020 --> 00:50:30.970
试图摧毁主反应堆
and attempt to knock out the main reactor.


417
00:50:33.860 --> 00:50:36.860
卡尔瑞辛将军自愿指挥战斗机的攻击
General Calrissian has volunteered to lead the fighter attack.


418
00:50:36.980 --> 00:50:38.270
祝好运
Good luck.


419
00:50:39.900 --> 00:50:41.860
你会需要好运的
You're gonna need it.


420
00:50:41.990 --> 00:50:43.700
麦迪恩将军
General Madine.


421
00:50:44.740 --> 00:50:47.660
我们偷了一艘帝国的小型飞船
We have stolen a small imperial shuttle.


422
00:50:47.790 --> 00:50:52.000
把它假扮成一艘运输船  然后使用一个秘密的帝国密码...
Disguised as a cargo ship and using a secret imperial code...


423
00:50:52.130 --> 00:50:56.920
我们可以把一队攻击部队运到卫星上去解除护盾的发生器
a strike team will land on the moon and deactivate the shield generator.


424
00:50:57.050 --> 00:50:58.290
听起来很危险
Sounds dangerous.


425
00:50:58.420 --> 00:51:00.710
我在猜他们会找谁接这个苦活
Wonder who they found to pull that off.


426
00:51:00.840 --> 00:51:03.840
索罗将军  你的攻击部队召集完毕了吗?
General Solo, is your strike team assembled?


427
00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:07.890
我的队伍做好准备了  但是我缺乏飞船的指挥人员
My team's ready. I don't have a command crew for the shuttle.


428
00:51:09.060 --> 00:51:11.140
这会很难的  我不想提起你
It's gonna be rough. I didn't wanna speak for you.


429
00:51:13.610 --> 00:51:17.560
- 好吧  你算一个 - 将军  算我一个
- That's one. - General, count me in.


430
00:51:17.690 --> 00:51:19.600
我也去
I'm with you too.


431
00:51:25.490 --> 00:51:28.250
- 怎么了? - 以后再问我
- What is it? - Ask me again sometime.


432
00:51:29.290 --> 00:51:31.990
- 卢克 - 嗨  汉  楚伊
Hi, Han, Chewie.


433
00:51:33.130 --> 00:51:35.580
"振奋人心"这样的词也无法表达此情此景
"Exciting" is hardly the word I would choose.


434
00:51:51.190 --> 00:51:54.220
听着  我希望你乘她去
Look, I want you to take her.


435
00:51:54.360 --> 00:51:55.900
我是说真的  乘她去
I mean it. Take her.


436
00:51:56.030 --> 00:51:57.730
你会拥有的所需的一切
You need all the help you can get.


437
00:51:57.730 --> 00:51:59.440
她可是舰队里面最快的飞船
She's the fastest ship in the fleet.


438
00:51:59.570 --> 00:52:01.900
好啦  老朋友
All right, old buddy.


439
00:52:02.030 --> 00:52:04.020
我知道她对你意味着什么
I know what she means to you.


440
00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:07.860
我会好好照顾她的  她连个划痕都不会有
I'll take good care of her. She won't get a scratch.


441
00:52:09.160 --> 00:52:10.570
怎么样?
All right?


442
00:52:10.710 --> 00:52:11.990
好吧
Right.


443
00:52:18.880 --> 00:52:21.460
你可是向我保证了  一个划痕都不会有
I got your promise. Not a scratch.


444
00:52:21.590 --> 00:52:23.750
你可以出发了吧  海盗先生?
Would you get going, you pirate?


445
00:52:25.510 --> 00:52:26.680
祝好运
Good luck.


446
00:52:26.810 --> 00:52:28.300
你也一样
You too.


447
00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:39.400
- 预热了吗? - 是的  她做好准备了
- Got her warmed? - Yeah, she's coming up.


448
00:52:42.070 --> 00:52:45.690
我估计帝国设计她的时候没考虑到会有伍基人会乘坐的  楚伊
I don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie.


449
00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:57.960
嘿  你清醒着吗?
Hey, you awake?


450
00:52:58.090 --> 00:53:01.540
是的  我只是有种很奇怪的感觉  好像我再也见不到她了
Yeah. I just got a funny feeling, like I'm not gonna see her again.


451
00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:06.050
来吧  将军  我们开始吧
Come on, General. Let's move.


452
00:53:06.180 --> 00:53:09.520
好的  楚伊  让我们看看这堆垃圾能干什么
Right. Chewie, let's see what this piece of junk can do.


453
00:53:09.640 --> 00:53:11.850
- 大家都准备好了吗? - 都好了
- Ready, everybody? - All set.


454
00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:16.190
那我们又上路了
Here we go again.


455
00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:29.110
好了  坚持住
All right, hang on.


456
00:53:45.430 --> 00:53:47.920
请问圣意如何?我的主人?
What is thy bidding, my master?


457
00:53:48.980 --> 00:53:52.350
派遣舰队去恩多星系的远端
Send the fleet to the far side of Endor.


458
00:53:55.360 --> 00:53:59.940
让他们在那里待命
There it will stay until called for.


459
00:54:01.320 --> 00:54:05.370
那对于反叛军在索拉斯特星系附近大规模活动的报告怎么处理?
What of the reports of the rebel fleet massing near Sullust?


460
00:54:05.490 --> 00:54:07.490
这无关紧要
It is of no concern.


461
00:54:08.290 --> 00:54:12.540
很快反叛军就会被扑灭  而年轻的天行者会成为我们之中的一员
Soon the rebellion will be crushed and young Skywalker will be one of us.


462
00:54:12.670 --> 00:54:14.460
你在这里的任务已经完成了  我的朋友
Your work here is finished, my friend.


463
00:54:14.590 --> 00:54:17.260
去指挥舰上等待我的命令
Go out to the command ship and await my orders.


464
00:54:17.380 --> 00:54:19.290
遵命  我的主人
Yes, my master.


465
00:54:35.020 --> 00:54:38.060
要是这招不灵  我们得赶快跑路
If they don't go for this, we're gonna have to get out pretty quick.


466
00:54:40.320 --> 00:54:42.990
贵机已经出现在我们的屏幕上了  请证实你们的身份
We have you on our screen now. Please identify.


467
00:54:44.580 --> 00:54:48.360
泰德瑞姆号小型飞船请求解除偏导护盾
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the deflector shield.


468
00:54:54.040 --> 00:54:58.090
泰德瑞姆号  请发送解除护盾的通行密码
Shuttle Tydirium, transmit the clearance code for shield passage.


469
00:54:59.510 --> 00:55:00.920
正在发送中
Transmission commencing.


470
00:55:01.050 --> 00:55:04.050
现在我们就会知道这密码值不值得我们付出那么大代价了
Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid.


471
00:55:05.180 --> 00:55:07.340
会有效的
It'll work. It'll work.


472
00:55:08.730 --> 00:55:10.880
维德在那艘船上
Vader's on that ship.


473
00:55:11.020 --> 00:55:12.850
卢克  别那么神经过敏
Don't get jittery, Luke.


474
00:55:12.980 --> 00:55:15.190
有好多指挥船呢
There are a lot of command ships.


475
00:55:16.280 --> 00:55:19.860
保持距离  楚伊  但是别让他们发现你在保持距离
Keep your distance, Chewie, but don't look like you're keeping your distance.


476
00:55:21.110 --> 00:55:23.570
我怎么知道怎么办  就正常飞好啦
I don't know. Fly casual.


477
00:55:28.830 --> 00:55:30.700
这艘飞船要去哪里?
Where is that shuttle going?


478
00:55:31.580 --> 00:55:33.870
泰德瑞姆号  你上面装了什么  你的目的地是哪里?
Shuttle Tydirium, what is your cargo and destination?


479
00:55:35.880 --> 00:55:37.920
森林卫星需要的零件和技术人员
Parts and technical crew for the forest moon.


480
00:55:40.130 --> 00:55:42.760
他们有通行密码吗?
Do they have a code clearance?


481
00:55:43.550 --> 00:55:45.800
是个老密码了  长官  不过是对的
It's an older code, sir, but it checks out.


482
00:55:45.930 --> 00:55:47.890
我准备让他们通过
I was about to clear them.


483
00:55:52.730 --> 00:55:54.970
我不该来的  我来了会让这个任务更难完成
I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come.


484
00:55:55.110 --> 00:55:57.400
这只是你的想像而已  孩子
It's your imagination, kid.


485
00:55:57.530 --> 00:56:00.280
怎么回事啊  让我们乐观点不好吗!
Come on. Let's keep a little optimism here.


486
00:56:08.410 --> 00:56:09.870
要我抓住他们吗?
Shall I hold them?


487
00:56:10.960 --> 00:56:13.830
不  让他们来吧
No. Leave them to me.


488
00:56:13.960 --> 00:56:16.250
我会亲自处理他们
I will deal with them myself.


489
00:56:17.130 --> 00:56:19.340
如您所愿  大人  继续吧
As you wish, my lord. Carry on.


490
00:56:21.220 --> 00:56:23.090
他们放我们过去了  楚伊
They're not going for it, Chewie.


491
00:56:27.310 --> 00:56:29.020
泰德瑞姆号
Shuttle Tydirium...


492
00:56:29.140 --> 00:56:31.520
护盾马上就会解除
deactivation of the shield will commence immediately.


493
00:56:31.650 --> 00:56:33.930
保持你们的航线
Follow your present course.


494
00:56:34.060 --> 00:56:36.560
看  我告诉你们会成功的吧
Okay. I told you it was gonna work.


495
00:56:36.690 --> 00:56:37.860
什么问题都没有
No problem.


496
00:57:11.270 --> 00:57:13.310
我告诉你们这里很危险吧
I told you it was dangerous here.


497
00:57:28.750 --> 00:57:32.200
- 要不我们绕一下路怎么样? - 太花时间了
- Should we try and go around? - It'll take time.


498
00:57:32.330 --> 00:57:35.330
要是让他们看到我们  我们整队人就白来一趟了
This whole party will be for nothing if they see us.


499
00:57:38.170 --> 00:57:40.460
楚伊和我会处理这问题的  你待这里别动
Chewie and I will take care of this. You stay here.


500
00:57:40.590 --> 00:57:43.260
要安静点  那边可能有更多敌人
Quietly. There might be more of them out there.


501
00:57:43.390 --> 00:57:44.760
嘿...
Hey...


502
00:57:44.890 --> 00:57:46.170
连我都不相信吗
it's me.


503
00:58:11.790 --> 00:58:13.780
去叫支援!快去!
Go for help! Go!


504
00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:15.410
太棒了  上啊!
Great. Come on!


505
00:58:30.980 --> 00:58:32.940
那边!还有两个敌人
Over there! Two more of them.


506
00:58:33.980 --> 00:58:36.270
我看到他们了  等着  莉娅!
I see them. Wait. Leia!


507
00:58:40.150 --> 00:58:41.610
嘿  等等!
Hey, wait!


508
00:58:47.910 --> 00:58:50.370
快  阻塞他们的通讯频道  用中间那个开关
Quick, jam their comlink. Centre switch.


509
00:59:02.010 --> 00:59:03.590
靠近点
Move closer.


510
00:59:06.060 --> 00:59:07.520
到他侧面去贴住他
Get alongside that one.


511
00:59:48.930 --> 00:59:51.060
你继续追这个家伙  我去对付那两个
Keep on that one. I'll take these two.


512
01:02:04.990 --> 01:02:06.740
索罗将军  有人来了
General Solo, somebody's coming.


513
01:02:20.090 --> 01:02:21.210
莉娅在哪?
Where's Leia?


514
01:02:22.090 --> 01:02:24.500
- 她还没回来? - 我还以为她和你在一起呢
- She didn't come back? - I thought she was with you.


515
01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:27.130
我们分开了  我们最好去找找她
We got separated. We better go look for her.


516
01:02:27.270 --> 01:02:30.300
你带小队继续前进  我们三点整在护盾发生器旁边会合
Take the squad ahead. We'll meet at the shield generator at 03:00.


517
01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:32.480
快点  R2  我们需要你的扫描器
Come on, R2. We'll need your scanners.


518
01:02:33.730 --> 01:02:36.350
别担心  卢克主人  我们知道该怎么办
Don't worry, Master Luke. We know what to do.


519
01:02:37.860 --> 01:02:39.980
你还说这里很美
And you said it was pretty here.


520
01:03:02.760 --> 01:03:04.640
别再碰我了
Cut it out.


521
01:03:21.490 --> 01:03:23.570
我不会伤害你的
I'm not gonna hurt you.


522
01:03:31.620 --> 01:03:34.290
看来我是困在这里了
Well, looks like I'm stuck here.


523
01:03:36.300 --> 01:03:38.590
糟糕的是  我都不知道这是哪里
Trouble is, I don't know where here is.


524
01:03:39.630 --> 01:03:41.590
也许你可以帮我
Maybe you can help me.


525
01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:44.550
来吧  坐这里
Come on. Sit down.


526
01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:48.640
我保证我决不伤害你  快过来啊
I promise I won't hurt you. Now come here.


527
01:03:50.390 --> 01:03:52.890
好吧  想吃点什么吗?
All right. You want something to eat?


528
01:03:59.650 --> 01:04:01.110
乖
That's right.


529
01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:07.740
来啊
Come on.


530
01:04:27.980 --> 01:04:29.350
看  只是顶头盔
Look. It's a hat.


531
01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:31.430
不会弄伤你的  来看看啊
It's not gonna hurt you. Look.


532
01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:40.530
你这个小家伙神经真过敏啊  是吧?
You're a jittery little thing, aren't you?


533
01:04:45.830 --> 01:04:47.370
是什么?
What is it?


534
01:05:26.990 --> 01:05:28.280
别动
Freeze!


535
01:05:28.410 --> 01:05:30.620
快点  起来
Come on. Get up.


536
01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:37.830
- 去拿你的车  把她带回基地 - 遵命
- Get your ride. Take her back to base. - Yes, sir.


537
01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:43.800
怎么...?
What the-


538
01:06:00.860 --> 01:06:03.440
快  我们离开这里
Come on. Let's get out of here.


539
01:06:45.450 --> 01:06:48.320
我告诉过你  让你待在指挥船上
I told you to remain on the command ship.


540
01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:54.790
一小队反抗军穿过了护盾  在恩多着陆了
A small rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on Endor.


541
01:06:56.380 --> 01:06:58.090
是啊  我知道
Yes, I know.


542
01:06:59.630 --> 01:07:01.840
我儿子和他们在一起
My son is with them.


543
01:07:03.510 --> 01:07:08.140
- 你肯定吗? - 我已经感觉到他了  我的主人
- Are you sure? - I have felt him, my master.


544
01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:12.090
真奇怪  我还没有感觉到
Strange that I have not.


545
01:07:13.690 --> 01:07:18.900
你对此事的感觉清楚无误吗  维德勋爵
I wonder if your feelings on this matter are clear, Lord Vader.


546
01:07:19.030 --> 01:07:21.780
很清楚  我的主人
They are clear, my master.


547
01:07:21.910 --> 01:07:26.150
那你就要去那颗守护卫星等他
Then you must go to the sanctuary moon and wait for him.


548
01:07:26.290 --> 01:07:29.290
他会来找我吗?
He will come to me?


549
01:07:31.540 --> 01:07:33.870
是的  我已经预见到了
I have foreseen it.


550
01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:38.050
他对你的同情心会让他万劫不复
His compassion for you will be his undoing.


551
01:07:38.170 --> 01:07:42.090
他会找到你  然后你要带他来见我
He will come to you, and then you will bring him before me.


552
01:07:42.890 --> 01:07:44.430
谨遵圣意
As you wish.


553
01:08:05.990 --> 01:08:07.400
卢克主人
Master Luke.


554
01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:13.880
那边还有两台毁掉的飞车
There's two more wrecked speeders back there.


555
01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:15.910
而且我还找到了这个
And I found this.


556
01:08:17.420 --> 01:08:21.800
恐怕R2的传感器找不到任何莉娅公主的踪迹
I'm afraid that R2's sensors can find no trace of Princess Leia.


557
01:08:24.220 --> 01:08:25.850
我希望她一切平安
I hope she's all right.


558
01:08:30.810 --> 01:08:31.930
什么事  楚伊?
What, Chewie?


559
01:08:34.610 --> 01:08:36.430
什么事  楚伊?
What, Chewie?


560
01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:53.450
我不懂  不过是只死兽而已  有什么好看的
I don't get it. It's just a dead animal.


561
01:08:54.290 --> 01:08:56.170
楚伊  等下  别碰!
Chewie, wait! Don't!


562
01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:02.180
干的漂亮
Nice work.


563
01:09:03.970 --> 01:09:05.800
干的真棒  楚伊
Great, Chewie.


564
01:09:05.930 --> 01:09:08.010
太漂亮了  你总是用胃来思考的吗?
Great. Always thinking with your stomach.


565
01:09:08.140 --> 01:09:11.310
别抱怨了  我们还是来想想怎么出去吧
Take it easy. Let's just figure a way to get out of this thing.


566
01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:13.150
汉  你能够碰到我的光剑吗?
Han, can you reach my lightsabre?


567
01:09:13.270 --> 01:09:14.730
当然可以
Yeah. Sure.


568
01:09:21.780 --> 01:09:24.320
R2  我不知道这是不是个好主意
R2, I'm not sure that's such a good idea.


569
01:09:24.450 --> 01:09:26.440
从这么高掉下去!
It's a very long drop!


570
01:10:09.370 --> 01:10:12.290
嘿  别用那玩意指着我
Hey. Point that thing someplace else.


571
01:10:16.840 --> 01:10:17.950
嘿!
Hey!


572
01:10:18.090 --> 01:10:20.550
汉  别这样  没事的
Han, don't. It'll be all right.


573
01:10:26.810 --> 01:10:29.260
楚伊  把你的弩给他们
Chewie, give them your crossbow.


574
01:10:31.350 --> 01:10:32.980
哦  我的头
Oh, my head.


575
01:10:37.230 --> 01:10:39.030
哦  天啊
Oh, my goodness.


576
01:11:10.850 --> 01:11:12.760
你懂得他们在说什么吗?
Do you understand anything they're saying?


577
01:11:12.900 --> 01:11:14.310
哦  是的  卢克主人
Oh, yes, Master Luke.


578
01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:17.230
要知道我可是通晓超过六百万种...
Remember that I am fluent in over six million forms-


579
01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:18.980
你对他们说什么了?
What are you telling them?


580
01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:22.270
我觉得我说的是"你好"
"Hello," I think.


581
01:11:22.410 --> 01:11:25.440
不过我也可能搞错了... 他们用的是一种很原始的语言...
I could be mistaken... they're using a very primitive dialect...


582
01:11:25.580 --> 01:11:29.110
但是我相信他们认为我是什么神
but I do believe they think I am some sort of god.


583
01:11:33.420 --> 01:11:37.910
那你干嘛不对他们显示点神力  让我们离开这里呢?
Why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this?


584
01:11:38.050 --> 01:11:40.920
对不起  索罗将军  但是这样做是不合适的
I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.


585
01:11:41.930 --> 01:11:43.300
合适?
Proper?


586
01:11:43.430 --> 01:11:46.050
我的程序不允许我假装成神祉
It's against my programming to impersonate a deity.


587
01:11:46.180 --> 01:11:47.430
为什么  你...
Why, you-


588
01:11:55.650 --> 01:11:57.140
我的错  请原谅
My mistake.


589
01:11:58.860 --> 01:12:00.820
他是我的老朋友了
He's an old friend of mine.


590
01:12:27.980 --> 01:12:29.350
嘿
Hey.


591
01:12:46.540 --> 01:12:48.990
我对此感觉很不好
I have a really bad feeling about this.


592
01:13:10.020 --> 01:13:11.600
他说什么?
What did he say?


593
01:13:11.730 --> 01:13:14.050
这么说真让我尴尬  索罗将军...
I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo...


594
01:13:14.190 --> 01:13:17.690
但是看起来你好像是为我举办宴会的主菜
but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honour.


595
01:13:35.210 --> 01:13:37.580
殿下
Your Royal Highness.


596
01:13:37.710 --> 01:13:39.460
这些人是我的朋友
These are my friends.


597
01:13:42.550 --> 01:13:46.760
3PO  告诉他们必须要释放他们

598
01:14:04.580 --> 01:14:07.740
不知怎么我感觉这好像没起什么作用
Somehow I got the feeling that didn't help us very much.


599
01:14:07.870 --> 01:14:11.790
3PO  告诉他们如果他们不按你说的做...

600
01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:13.870
你会非常生气  并且会使用你的神力
you'll become angry and use your magic.


601
01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.370
但是  卢克主人  什么神力?我根本就不会什么...
But, Master Luke, what magic? I couldn't possibly...


602
01:14:16.500 --> 01:14:18.050
就这么对他们说
Tell them.


603
01:14:33.980 --> 01:14:36.060
你看到没  卢克主人?他们不相信我...
You see, Master Luke? They didn't believe me...


604
01:14:36.190 --> 01:14:37.770
就如同我说的一样
just as I said they wouldn't.


605
01:14:37.900 --> 01:14:39.180
等等
Wait.


606
01:14:47.830 --> 01:14:49.700
怎么回事?
What's happening?


607
01:14:55.130 --> 01:14:56.840
放我下来  救命啊!
Put me down! Help!


608
01:14:56.960 --> 01:14:58.510
谁放我下来啊!
Somebody!


609
01:14:58.630 --> 01:14:59.960
救命啊!
Somebody help!


610
01:15:00.090 --> 01:15:02.800
卢克主人!R2  快救救我!
Master Luke! R2, quickly!


611
01:15:34.540 --> 01:15:35.920
谢天谢地
Thank goodness.


612
01:15:48.270 --> 01:15:49.930
谢谢你  3PO
Thanks, 3PO.


613
01:15:51.190 --> 01:15:53.140
我从来不知道我有这种能力
I never knew I had it in me.


614
01:16:00.740 --> 01:16:02.200
...塔图因...
...Tatooine...


615
01:16:03.620 --> 01:16:06.020
莉娅公主... R2
Princess Leia... R2.


616
01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:09.660
...达斯·维德!
...Darth Vader!


617
01:16:12.790 --> 01:16:14.540
...死星
...Death Star.


618
01:16:17.550 --> 01:16:19.790
...绝地武士...  欧比·旺·科努比
...Jedi... Obi-Wan Kenobi.


619
01:16:25.390 --> 01:16:27.260
好啦  R2  我马上就要说到这个了
Yes, R2, I was just coming to that.


620
01:16:30.730 --> 01:16:31.720
卢克主人...
Master Luke...


621
01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:42.020
...千年鹰号...云雾城
...Millennium Falcon... Cloud City.


622
01:16:44.700 --> 01:16:45.780
...维德!
...Vader!


623
01:16:46.830 --> 01:16:48.070
汉·索罗...
Han Solo...


624
01:16:50.250 --> 01:16:51.710
...碳化
...carbon.


625
01:16:53.290 --> 01:16:54.540
...沙列克
...Sarlacc.


626
01:17:16.190 --> 01:17:19.030
- 怎么回事? - 我不知道
- What's going on? - I don't know.


627
01:17:32.790 --> 01:17:35.460
太好了  我们现在是部落的一份子了
Wonderful. We are now a part of the tribe.


628
01:17:36.880 --> 01:17:38.750
我早就等着这一天了
Just what I always wanted.


629
01:17:50.560 --> 01:17:52.850
帮点忙也比不帮忙好啊  楚伊
Short help's better than no help at all, Chewie.


630
01:17:58.490 --> 01:18:01.690
侦察兵们会告诉我们通向护盾发生器最快的路在哪
The scouts will show us the quickest way to the shield generator.


631
01:18:01.820 --> 01:18:03.780
太好了  有多远?
Good. How far is it?


632
01:18:03.910 --> 01:18:05.530
问他
Ask him.


633
01:18:06.740 --> 01:18:08.870
对了  我们还需要些补给
We need some fresh supplies too.


634
01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:10.910
还有  最好能把我们的武器要回来
Try and get our weapons back.


635
01:18:12.420 --> 01:18:14.620
快点  我们时间不多了
Hurry up. I haven't got all day.


636
01:18:17.130 --> 01:18:19.000
卢克  怎么了?
Luke, what's wrong?


637
01:18:20.930 --> 01:18:24.380
莉娅  你记得你的母亲吗?
Leia, do you remember your mother-


638
01:18:24.510 --> 01:18:26.550
你真正的母亲?
your real mother?


639
01:18:26.680 --> 01:18:30.180
只记得一点了  我很小的时候她就去世了
Just a little bit. She died when I was very young.


640
01:18:30.310 --> 01:18:32.220
你还记得什么?
What do you remember?


641
01:18:32.350 --> 01:18:34.930
只有一点印象了  还有感觉
Just images really. Feelings.


642
01:18:35.070 --> 01:18:36.640
告诉我
Tell me.


643
01:18:38.360 --> 01:18:41.400
她...非常美
She was... very beautiful.


644
01:18:41.530 --> 01:18:44.150
很善良...但是也很忧伤
Kind... but sad.


645
01:18:46.330 --> 01:18:49.110
你干嘛问我这个?
Why are you asking me this?


646
01:18:49.250 --> 01:18:51.700
我一点都不记得我母亲了
I have no memory of my mother.


647
01:18:52.750 --> 01:18:54.740
我从来没有见过她
I never knew her.


648
01:18:56.550 --> 01:18:58.710
卢克  告诉我  什么让你这么忧心忡忡?
Luke, tell me. What's troubling you?


649
01:19:03.640 --> 01:19:07.420
维德在这里  就是现在  就在这颗卫星上
Vader is here. Now. On this moon.


650
01:19:09.060 --> 01:19:10.770
你怎么知道?
How do you know?


651
01:19:10.890 --> 01:19:12.800
我感觉到他的存在了
I felt his presence.


652
01:19:13.860 --> 01:19:17.110
他来找我了  如果我离他足够近他就能感觉到
He's come for me. He can feel when I'm near.


653
01:19:17.230 --> 01:19:19.110
这就是我为什么必须离开
That's why I have to go.


654
01:19:19.240 --> 01:19:21.710
只要我待在这里  我就会危害到整组人的安全  
As long as I stay, I'm endangering the group 


655
01:19:21.720 --> 01:19:22.690
也会影响任务的完成
and our mission here.


656
01:19:23.740 --> 01:19:26.700
- 我必须要面对他 - 为什么?
- I have to face him. - Why?


657
01:19:31.710 --> 01:19:33.580
他是我的父亲
He's my father.


658
01:19:37.630 --> 01:19:39.170
你的父亲?
Your father?


659
01:19:40.470 --> 01:19:44.470
还有其他的事  你可能听起来很难接受  但是你必须要接受
There's more. It won't be easy for you to hear it, but you must.


660
01:19:44.600 --> 01:19:47.430
如果我回不来的话  你就是同盟军的唯一希望了
If I don't make it back, you're the only hope for the Alliance.


661
01:19:47.560 --> 01:19:49.050
别这么说
Don't talk that way.


662
01:19:49.180 --> 01:19:53.680
我无法理解你的能力  永远无法理解
You have a power I don't understand and could never have.


663
01:19:53.810 --> 01:19:55.810
你错了  莉娅
You're wrong, Leia.


664
01:19:55.940 --> 01:19:57.770
你也有同样的力量
You have that power too.


665
01:19:57.900 --> 01:20:01.240
等时间到了  你会和我一样学会使用这种力量
In time, you'll learn to use it as I have.


666
01:20:05.870 --> 01:20:08.110
"原力"在我的家族中都很强
The Force is strong in my family.


667
01:20:09.660 --> 01:20:11.570
我的父亲拥有它
My father has it.


668
01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:14.880
我拥有它
I have it.


669
01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:16.330
还有...
And...


670
01:20:17.630 --> 01:20:20.000
我的姐妹也拥有它
my sister has it.


671
01:20:26.310 --> 01:20:29.430
是的  就是你  莉娅
Yes. It's you, Leia.


672
01:20:34.690 --> 01:20:36.320
我知道
I know.


673
01:20:39.150 --> 01:20:40.780
不知道怎么回事...
Somehow...


674
01:20:42.490 --> 01:20:44.070
我一直能体会到这些
I've always known.


675
01:20:44.200 --> 01:20:46.160
那你就知道为什么我必须要面对他
Then you know why I have to face him.


676
01:20:48.290 --> 01:20:50.700
卢克  跑吧  跑远远的
Luke, run away. Far away.


677
01:20:50.830 --> 01:20:54.170
如果他能感觉到你的存在  就离开这个地方
If he can feel your presence, then leave this place.


678
01:20:54.290 --> 01:20:57.540
- 我多希望我能和你一起去啊 - 不  你不能去
- I wish I could go with you. - No, you don't.


679
01:20:57.670 --> 01:20:59.630
你一直都很坚强
You've always been strong.


680
01:21:00.930 --> 01:21:03.210
但是为什么你必须要面对他?
But why must you confront him?


681
01:21:03.350 --> 01:21:07.050
因为他的心中还有善良  我可以感觉到
Because there is good in him. I've felt it.


682
01:21:07.180 --> 01:21:09.180
他不会把我转变到皇帝那边去.
He won't turn me over to the emperor.


683
01:21:09.310 --> 01:21:12.430
相反的  我可以拯救他  把他转变到正义的这边来
I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side.


684
01:21:13.860 --> 01:21:15.650
我必须要试试
I have to try.


685
01:21:34.170 --> 01:21:36.080
嘿  你们在干嘛?
Hey, what's going on?


686
01:21:37.880 --> 01:21:41.170
没什么  我只是想单独待一会儿
Nothing. I just wanna be alone for a little while.


687
01:21:42.550 --> 01:21:44.180
没什么?
Nothing?


688
01:21:45.970 --> 01:21:47.880
告诉我  怎么了?
Tell me. What's going on?


689
01:21:53.060 --> 01:21:55.220
我不能告诉你
I can't tell you.


690
01:21:56.860 --> 01:21:59.480
那你能对卢克说?你只能对他说吗?
Could you tell Luke? Is that who you could tell?


691
01:22:17.340 --> 01:22:18.960
对不起
I'm sorry.


692
01:22:22.680 --> 01:22:24.390
抱着我
Hold me.


693
01:23:17.690 --> 01:23:19.570
这是投降的反叛军
This is the rebel that surrendered.


694
01:23:19.700 --> 01:23:22.610
尽管他否认  我还是相信还有更多他们的人
Although he denies it, I believe there may be more of them...


695
01:23:22.740 --> 01:23:25.450
我请求批准对这一地区作进一步搜索
and I request permission to conduct a further search of the area.


696
01:23:26.540 --> 01:23:29.240
他身上的武器只有这个
He was armed only with this.


697
01:23:31.250 --> 01:23:32.960
干的很好  指挥官阁下
Good work, Commander.


698
01:23:33.080 --> 01:23:34.990
你可以离开了
Leave us.


699
01:23:35.130 --> 01:23:38.790
进行搜索  把他的同伴抓来
Conduct your search and bring his companions to me.


700
01:23:40.260 --> 01:23:42.000
遵命  大人
Yes, my lord.


701
01:23:43.850 --> 01:23:45.970
皇帝陛下一直在等你
The emperor has been expecting you.


702
01:23:47.350 --> 01:23:48.760
我知道  父亲
I know, Father.


703
01:23:50.270 --> 01:23:52.590
就是说  你已经接受了事实了
So, you have accepted the truth.


704
01:23:53.770 --> 01:23:57.270
我接受的事实是你曾经是天行者安纳金  父亲
I've accepted the truth that you were once Anakin Skywalker, my father.


705
01:23:57.400 --> 01:24:00.600
那个名字对我已经没有任何意义了
That name no longer has any meaning for me.


706
01:24:01.410 --> 01:24:04.160
那名字代表的才是真正的你  你只是忘了而已
It is the name of your true self. You've only forgotten.


707
01:24:04.950 --> 01:24:06.580
我知道你心中还有善意
I know there is good in you.


708
01:24:06.700 --> 01:24:09.320
皇帝没有从你心中全部夺走它
The emperor hasn't driven it from you fully.


709
01:24:13.290 --> 01:24:15.500
这就是为什么你以前没有杀害我
That was why you couldn't destroy me.


710
01:24:16.550 --> 01:24:19.080
这就是为什么你现在不会带我去见你的皇帝
That's why you won't bring me to your emperor now.


711
01:24:26.350 --> 01:24:29.380
看来你又制造了一柄新的光剑啊
I see you have constructed a new lightsabre.


712
01:24:33.020 --> 01:24:35.980
你的技巧已经尽善尽美了
Your skills are complete.


713
01:24:41.200 --> 01:24:45.780
你确实很强大  如同皇帝预见的一样
Indeed you are powerful, as the emperor has foreseen.


714
01:24:50.750 --> 01:24:52.490
跟我来
Come with me.


715
01:24:54.590 --> 01:24:57.460
欧比·旺以前也这么想
Obi-Wan once thought as you do.


716
01:24:58.760 --> 01:25:03.550
但是你不知道黑暗的力量有多强
You don't know the power of the dark side.


717
01:25:03.680 --> 01:25:06.430
我必须服从我的主人
I must obey my master.


718
01:25:07.520 --> 01:25:10.930
我不会投入你的一方的  你只能被迫杀了我
I will not turn, and you'll be forced to kill me.


719
01:25:12.310 --> 01:25:14.890
如果这是你的命运的话
If that is your destiny.


720
01:25:15.020 --> 01:25:18.810
仔细感觉一下  父亲  你怎么能这么做
Search your feelings, Father. You can't do this.


721
01:25:18.940 --> 01:25:21.570
我能感觉到你心中的矛盾  放开你心中的仇恨吧
I feel the conflict within you. Let go of your hate.


722
01:25:22.820 --> 01:25:26.240
太晚了  儿子
It is too late for me, son.


723
01:25:29.460 --> 01:25:33.790
皇帝陛下会向你展示"原力"的真实本质
The emperor will show you the true nature of the Force.


724
01:25:33.920 --> 01:25:37.540
他现在是你的主人了
He is your master now.


725
01:25:41.590 --> 01:25:44.000
那我父亲就真的是死了
Then my father is truly dead.


726
01:26:27.020 --> 01:26:28.930
控制堡的主入口...
The main entrance to the control bunker...


727
01:26:29.060 --> 01:26:31.050
就在那着陆平台的另一端
is on the far side of that landing platform.


728
01:26:31.940 --> 01:26:35.560
- 这任务不容易 - 别担心
- This isn't gonna be easy. - Don't worry.


729
01:26:35.690 --> 01:26:38.810
楚伊和我去过很多比这更防卫森严的地方
Chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.


730
01:26:47.160 --> 01:26:48.790
他说什么?
What's he saying?


731
01:26:48.910 --> 01:26:52.250
他说有一条秘密通道通向山脊的另一侧
He says there's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge.


732
01:27:11.480 --> 01:27:14.850
司令官  我们已经就位了  所有战机都准备好了
Admiral, we're in position. All fighters accounted for.


733
01:27:15.730 --> 01:27:17.690
准备倒数计时
Proceed with the countdown.


734
01:27:18.900 --> 01:27:21.360
所有部队准备进入攻击坐标
All groups assume attack coordinates.


735
01:27:24.740 --> 01:27:26.700
别担心  我的朋友在下面
Don't worry. My friend's down there.


736
01:27:26.830 --> 01:27:29.370
他会按时解除护盾的
He'll have that shield down on time.


737
01:27:32.330 --> 01:27:34.820
要不然这就是历时最短的攻击了
Or this'll be the shortest offensive of all time.


738
01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:40.500
所有飞船  按我命令  准备进行超空间跳跃
All craft, prepare to jump into hyperspace on my mark.


739
01:27:40.630 --> 01:27:42.590
好  准备
All right. Stand by.


740
01:28:02.200 --> 01:28:04.320
后门  是吧?这主意不错
Back door, huh? Good idea.


741
01:28:12.710 --> 01:28:15.660
只有几个警卫  应该不怎么困难
It's only a few guards. This shouldn't be too much trouble.


742
01:28:20.840 --> 01:28:23.680
只要一个人发现就足以拉响警报了
It only takes one to sound the alarm.


743
01:28:23.800 --> 01:28:26.300
那我们就无声无息的把他们干掉
Then we'll do it real quiet-like.


744
01:28:26.430 --> 01:28:28.920
- 哦  天啊  莉娅公主 - 安静
- Oh, my. Princess Leia. - Quiet.


745
01:28:30.270 --> 01:28:32.060
我恐怕我们的毛绒同伴...
I'm afraid our furry companion...


746
01:28:32.190 --> 01:28:34.310
已经跑过去做什么冒失的举动了
has gone and done something rather rash.


747
01:28:39.820 --> 01:28:41.780
突然袭击没戏了
There goes our surprise attack.


748
01:28:49.080 --> 01:28:51.320
看  那里!抓住他!
Look, over there! Stop him!


749
01:29:03.220 --> 01:29:06.260
这小毛球干的还真不错  就剩一个了
Not bad for a little furball. There's only one left.


750
01:29:06.390 --> 01:29:08.850
你待在这里  我们会解决掉他的
You stay here. We'll take care of this.


751
01:29:10.980 --> 01:29:13.180
我决定我们应该待在此处
I have decided that we shall stay here.


752
01:29:43.050 --> 01:29:44.050
嘿!
Hey!


753
01:30:48.200 --> 01:30:50.990
欢迎啊  年轻的天行者
Welcome, young Skywalker.


754
01:30:51.120 --> 01:30:53.450
我等你多时了
I have been expecting you.


755
01:30:54.500 --> 01:30:56.460
你再也不需要那些了
You'll no longer need those.


756
01:31:01.930 --> 01:31:03.800
警卫  你可以退下了
Guards, leave us.


757
01:31:11.230 --> 01:31:14.680
我正期待着完成你的训练呢
I'm looking forward to completing your training.


758
01:31:14.820 --> 01:31:19.890
到时  你就会承认我是你的主人了
In time, you will call me master.


759
01:31:20.030 --> 01:31:22.490
那你就大错特错了
You're gravely mistaken.


760
01:31:22.620 --> 01:31:24.740
你无法像对我父亲一样转变我
You won't convert me as you did my father.


761
01:31:25.620 --> 01:31:29.370
哦  不  年轻的绝地武士
Oh, no, my young Jedi.


762
01:31:31.500 --> 01:31:35.580
你会发现错的是你...
You will find that it is you who are mistaken...


763
01:31:37.010 --> 01:31:41.130
而且你对于很多事情理解都是错的
about a great many things.


764
01:31:42.840 --> 01:31:44.470
这是他的光剑
His lightsabre.


765
01:31:44.600 --> 01:31:48.260
啊  没错  绝地武士的武器
Ah, yes. AJedi's weapon.


766
01:31:49.060 --> 01:31:51.470
和你父亲的差不多
Much like your father's.


767
01:31:51.600 --> 01:31:56.400
但是你要知道你父亲再也无法脱离黑暗一方了
By now you must know your father can never be turned from the dark side.


768
01:31:56.530 --> 01:31:59.360
而你也将如此
So will it be with you.


769
01:31:59.490 --> 01:32:01.530
你错了
You're wrong.


770
01:32:01.660 --> 01:32:04.740
很快我就会死去...而你会和我一起死去
Soon I'll be dead- and you with me.


771
01:32:08.200 --> 01:32:12.500
也许你说的是你们反叛舰队马上要进行的攻击吧
Perhaps you refer to the imminent attack of your rebel fleet.


772
01:32:13.330 --> 01:32:14.750
没错吧
Yes.


773
01:32:14.880 --> 01:32:20.000
我向你保证我们待在这里是非常安全的
I assure you we are quite safe from your friends here.


774
01:32:21.180 --> 01:32:24.050
你的过于自信正是你的弱点
Your overconfidence is your weakness.


775
01:32:24.180 --> 01:32:27.300
你对于你朋友的迷信则是你的弱点
Your faith in your friends is yours.


776
01:32:29.850 --> 01:32:33.430
反抗是无意义的  儿子
It is pointless to resist, my son.


777
01:32:37.490 --> 01:32:42.940
已经发生的一切都是按我的剧本在进行
Everything that has transpired has done so according to my design.


778
01:32:43.070 --> 01:32:46.280
你在守护卫星上的那群朋友
Your friends up there on the sanctuary moon...


779
01:32:46.410 --> 01:32:50.740
正在迈进一个陷阱  你们的反抗舰队也一样
are walking into a trap, as is your rebel fleet.


780
01:32:52.670 --> 01:32:55.160
是我允许同盟军...
It was I who allowed the Alliance...


781
01:32:55.300 --> 01:32:58.710
知道护盾发生器的地点的
to know the location of the shield generator.


782
01:32:58.840 --> 01:33:02.890
你们那一小群可怜的家伙对它是无法撼动分毫的
It is quite safe from your pitiful little band.


783
01:33:03.010 --> 01:33:07.260
一群我最好的部队正在等待着他们呢
An entire legion of my best troops awaits them.


784
01:33:09.770 --> 01:33:13.520
恐怕偏导护盾...
I'm afraid the deflector shield...


785
01:33:13.650 --> 01:33:18.860
到你朋友来的时候还会工作的很正常呢!
will be quite operational when your friends arrive.


786
01:33:22.410 --> 01:33:23.740
好啦!
All right!


787
01:33:23.870 --> 01:33:25.360
起来!走开!
Up! Move!


788
01:33:25.490 --> 01:33:26.950
快点  快点
Quickly. Quickly.


789
01:33:31.460 --> 01:33:33.080
汉  快点
Han, hurry.


790
01:33:33.210 --> 01:33:35.080
舰队马上就要来了
The fleet will be here any moment.


791
01:33:36.800 --> 01:33:39.040
冲啊  上啊!
Charges. Come on. Come on!


792
01:33:41.180 --> 01:33:43.000
哦  天啊  他们会被抓的
Oh, my. They'll be captured.


793
01:33:45.890 --> 01:33:47.600
等等!回来!
Wait! Come back!


794
01:33:50.100 --> 01:33:51.890
R2  和我待在一起
R2, stay with me.


795
01:33:52.940 --> 01:33:54.560
别动!
Freeze!


796
01:33:57.940 --> 01:33:59.900
你们这群反叛的混蛋
You rebel scum.


797
01:34:19.590 --> 01:34:22.960
- 所有部门向我报告 - 红色长机待命
- All wings report in. - Red Leader standing by.


798
01:34:23.100 --> 01:34:26.260
- 灰色长机待命 - 绿色长机待命
- Grey Leader standing by. - Green Leader standing by.


799
01:34:27.140 --> 01:34:29.260
将S型叶片锁定在攻击位置上
Lock S-foils in attack positions.


800
01:34:32.940 --> 01:34:35.060
愿"原力"与我们同在!
May the Force be with us.


801
01:34:38.650 --> 01:34:41.650
我们马上就能知道这个护盾究竟是不是解除了
We've gotta be able to get a reading on that shield- up or down.


802
01:34:43.320 --> 01:34:45.990
如果他们不知道我们会来
How could they be jamming us if they don't know-


803
01:34:47.040 --> 01:34:48.610
他们怎么会干扰我们的通信
if we're coming.


804
01:34:48.750 --> 01:34:52.250
放弃进攻  护盾仍然在工作
Break off the attack. The shield is still up.


805
01:34:52.380 --> 01:34:54.450
我没有收到任何探测数据  你肯定吗?
I get no reading. You sure?


806
01:34:54.590 --> 01:34:56.740
拉起!所有飞船拉起!
Pull up! All craft pull up!


807
01:35:01.260 --> 01:35:05.210
进行规避动作  绿色编队  紧密控制MV-7地区
Take evasive action. Green Group, stick close to Holding Sector MV-7.


808
01:35:07.060 --> 01:35:09.810
司令官  47区发现敌舰
Admiral, we have enemy ships in Sector 47.


809
01:35:09.940 --> 01:35:11.430
这是个陷阱
It's a trap.


810
01:35:15.020 --> 01:35:16.980
战机逼近
Fighters coming in.


811
01:35:20.450 --> 01:35:21.770
他们数量太多了
There's too many.


812
01:35:25.120 --> 01:35:28.490
加速至战斗速度  吸引他们的火力  不要让他们射击巡洋舰
Accelerate to attack speed. Draw their fire away from the cruisers.


813
01:35:28.620 --> 01:35:29.650
金色长机  遵命
Copy, Gold Leader.


814
01:35:33.080 --> 01:35:34.580
来吧  孩子
Come, boy.


815
01:35:35.460 --> 01:35:37.420
自己看看
See for yourself.


816
01:35:40.090 --> 01:35:45.300
从这里  你将见证到同盟军的最后毁灭
From here, you will witness the final destruction of the Alliance...


817
01:35:45.430 --> 01:35:49.260
和你们那无关痛痒的反叛的最后终结
and the end of your insignificant rebellion.


818
01:35:54.520 --> 01:35:56.850
你想要这个
You want this...


819
01:35:57.650 --> 01:35:59.530
对吧?
don't you?


820
01:35:59.650 --> 01:36:04.150
你胸中的仇恨正越来越强
The hate is swelling in you now.


821
01:36:04.950 --> 01:36:07.110
拿起你的绝地武器吧
Take your Jedi weapon.


822
01:36:07.250 --> 01:36:08.990
用他来杀我
Use it.


823
01:36:09.120 --> 01:36:11.080
我现在手无存铁
I am unarmed.


824
01:36:11.210 --> 01:36:13.080
用他把我击倒吧
Strike me down with it.


825
01:36:13.210 --> 01:36:15.750
屈服于你的愤怒
Give in to your anger.


826
01:36:16.800 --> 01:36:21.920
每一刻  你都将逐渐变成我的仆人
With each passing moment you make yourself more my servant.


827
01:36:28.520 --> 01:36:30.560
这是无可避免的
It is unavoidable.


828
01:36:31.650 --> 01:36:33.770
这是你命中注定的
It is your destiny.


829
01:36:34.820 --> 01:36:37.940
你  和你父亲一样...
You, like your father...


830
01:36:38.070 --> 01:36:39.690
现在...
are now...


831
01:36:40.610 --> 01:36:42.240
都是我的了
mine.


832
01:37:00.380 --> 01:37:02.710
好啦  快走啊
All right, move it.


833
01:37:10.730 --> 01:37:12.350
喂  我说  那边的
Hello. I say, over there.


834
01:37:13.310 --> 01:37:15.470
你们在找我吗?
Were you looking for me?


835
01:37:16.820 --> 01:37:18.860
把那两个家伙抓过来
Bring those two down here.


836
01:37:26.490 --> 01:37:30.790
他们过来了  R2  你肯定这是个好主意吗?
They're on their way. R2, are you sure this was a good idea?


837
01:37:30.920 --> 01:37:32.240
站住
Freeze.


838
01:37:32.380 --> 01:37:33.490
别动
Don't move.


839
01:37:33.630 --> 01:37:35.540
我们投降
We surrender.


840
01:39:41.220 --> 01:39:43.090
密码已经变了
The code's changed.


841
01:39:43.220 --> 01:39:45.590
- 我们需要R2 - 终端在这里
- We need R2. - Here's the terminal.


842
01:39:45.720 --> 01:39:47.720
R2  你在哪里?
R2, where are you?


843
01:39:47.850 --> 01:39:49.810
到地堡这里来  我们需要你
We need you at the bunker right away.


844
01:39:51.900 --> 01:39:53.390
走?你什么意思?
Going? What do you mean?


845
01:39:55.110 --> 01:39:56.730
去哪里啊  R2?
Going where, R2?


846
01:39:56.860 --> 01:40:01.070
等等  R2  这可不是逞英雄的时候
Wait. R2, this is no time for heroics.


847
01:40:01.200 --> 01:40:02.860
回来!
Come back!


848
01:40:29.100 --> 01:40:30.890
小心  威治  有三架从你头顶方向来了
Watch yourself, Wedge. Three from above.


849
01:40:31.020 --> 01:40:33.940
- 红色三号  红色二号  靠近我 - 明白
- Red Three, Red Two, pull in. - Got it.


850
01:40:37.190 --> 01:40:38.940
三架敌机逼近  角度20度
Three of them coming in, 20 degrees.


851
01:40:39.070 --> 01:40:40.780
向左急转  我对付长机
Cut left. I'll take the leader.


852
01:40:49.120 --> 01:40:50.870
他们正飞向医疗舰
They're heading for the medical frigate.


853
01:40:55.880 --> 01:40:57.080
气压稳定
Pressure's steady.


854
01:41:06.270 --> 01:41:09.550
只有战斗机在攻击  灭星者在等什么?
Only the fighters are attacking. What are the Stardestroyers waiting for?


855
01:41:14.190 --> 01:41:15.900
长官!我们已经就位  准备攻击!
We're in attack position, sir.


856
01:41:16.030 --> 01:41:19.190
- 就地等待 - 我们不进攻吗  长官?
- Hold here. - We're not going to attack?


857
01:41:19.320 --> 01:41:22.610
我的命令是陛下亲自下的  他有特殊计划
My orders are from the emperor himself. He has something special planned.


858
01:41:22.740 --> 01:41:24.650
我们只要防止他们逃跑即可
We only need to keep them from escaping.


859
01:41:26.370 --> 01:41:30.450
如你所见  年轻的学徒
As you can see, my young apprentice...


860
01:41:30.580 --> 01:41:33.830
你的朋友们已经失败了
your friends have failed.


861
01:41:34.630 --> 01:41:37.000
现在看看这个...
Now witness the firepower...


862
01:41:37.130 --> 01:41:42.470
全副武装的战斗基地的威力吧
of this fully armed and operational battle station.


863
01:41:43.640 --> 01:41:46.180
指挥官  自由射击!
Fire at will, Commander.


864
01:41:53.190 --> 01:41:54.900
射击
Fire.


865
01:42:01.530 --> 01:42:04.070
这是从死星射出来的
That blast came from the Death Star.


866
01:42:05.030 --> 01:42:07.360
那家伙可以工作
That thing's operational.


867
01:42:07.500 --> 01:42:09.320
大本营一号  这是金色长机
Home 1, this is Gold Leader.


868
01:42:09.460 --> 01:42:11.530
我们也见到了  所有部队准备撤退
We saw it. All craft prepare to retreat.


869
01:42:11.670 --> 01:42:13.870
可是你再不会得到这么好的机会了  司令官
You won't get another chance at this, Admiral.


870
01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.750
我们别无选择  卡尔瑞辛将军
We have no choice, General Calrissian.


871
01:42:16.880 --> 01:42:20.170
我们的巡洋舰顶不住那个级别的攻击
Our cruisers can't repel firepower of that magnitude.


872
01:42:20.300 --> 01:42:24.000
汉会解除那个护盾的  我们要给他更多的时间
Han will have that shield down. We've gotta give him more time.


873
01:42:42.820 --> 01:42:44.230
我们来啦
We're coming.


874
01:42:50.120 --> 01:42:51.450
快啊
Come on.


875
01:42:55.250 --> 01:42:56.630
R2  快点!
R2, hurry!


876
01:43:02.680 --> 01:43:03.630
天啊!
My goodness!


877
01:43:09.730 --> 01:43:11.720
你干嘛要这么英勇?
Why did you have to be so brave?


878
01:43:14.900 --> 01:43:17.440
好吧  我猜我能找到开门的线路
Well, I suppose I could hot-wire this thing.


879
01:43:17.570 --> 01:43:19.030
我掩护你
I'll cover you.


880
01:44:00.610 --> 01:44:03.070
是的  靠近  能有多近就有多近
Yes, I said closer. Move as close as you can...


881
01:44:03.200 --> 01:44:05.900
在极近距离对灭星者进行攻击
and engage those Stardestroyers at point-blank range.


882
01:44:06.040 --> 01:44:09.450
但是在那种距离我们顶不住灭星者多久的攻击
At that close range, we won't last long against those Stardestroyers.


883
01:44:09.580 --> 01:44:12.200
起码比死星的攻击顶的要久
We'll last longer than we will against that Death Star...


884
01:44:12.330 --> 01:44:14.580
我们说不定还能干掉一两艘
and we might take a few of them with us.


885
01:44:17.510 --> 01:44:18.830
她要爆炸啦!
She's gonna blow!


886
01:44:22.930 --> 01:44:24.510
我被击中了!
I'm hit!


887
01:44:29.690 --> 01:44:31.840
你的舰队已经失败了
Your fleet is lost...


888
01:44:31.980 --> 01:44:36.020
而你在恩多卫星上的朋友们也不可能存活
and your friends on the Endor moon will not survive.


889
01:44:38.320 --> 01:44:40.730
无路可逃啦
There is no escape...


890
01:44:40.860 --> 01:44:43.490
年轻的学徒
my young apprentice.


891
01:44:45.700 --> 01:44:48.160
同盟即将毁灭
The Alliance will die...


892
01:44:50.040 --> 01:44:52.880
你的朋友也将死去
as will your friends.


893
01:44:56.500 --> 01:44:57.790
很好
Good.


894
01:44:58.800 --> 01:45:02.050
我能感觉到你的愤怒
I can feel your anger.


895
01:45:03.800 --> 01:45:07.300
我现在没有防护  拿起你的武器吧
I am defenceless. Take your weapon.


896
01:45:07.430 --> 01:45:10.550
用你的仇恨将我击倒...
Strike me down with all of your hatred...


897
01:45:10.690 --> 01:45:15.180
然后你就将彻底进入黑暗一方
and your journey towards the dark side will be complete.


898
01:45:54.480 --> 01:45:56.520
- 看! - 把他从那弄走!
- Look! - Get him off of there.


899
01:47:49.690 --> 01:47:51.680
我想我找到方法了
I think I got it.


900
01:47:51.810 --> 01:47:53.060
我找到了
I got it!


901
01:48:00.360 --> 01:48:01.640
你还好吗?
Are you all right?


902
01:48:01.780 --> 01:48:03.660
- 让我看看 - 还不错
- Let's see. - It's not bad.


903
01:48:03.780 --> 01:48:05.060
- 站住! - 哦  亲爱的
- Freeze! - Oh, dear.


904
01:48:05.200 --> 01:48:06.700
别动
Don't move.


905
01:48:11.170 --> 01:48:13.870
- 我爱你 - 我知道
- I love you. - I know.


906
01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:15.330
举起手来
Hands up.


907
01:48:16.460 --> 01:48:17.660
站起来
Stand up.


908
01:48:27.520 --> 01:48:28.980
退后
Stay back.


909
01:48:36.900 --> 01:48:39.610
下来  她受伤了
Get down here. She's wounded.


910
01:48:39.740 --> 01:48:41.560
不  等一下
No, wait.


911
01:48:41.700 --> 01:48:43.280
我有法子了
I got an idea.


912
01:48:54.590 --> 01:48:56.080
很好
Good.


913
01:48:56.210 --> 01:49:00.000
感觉你好战的心吧  孩子
Use your aggressive feelings, boy.


914
01:49:00.130 --> 01:49:02.840
让仇恨充满你的全身
Let the hate flow through you.


915
01:49:08.520 --> 01:49:12.100
欧比·旺把你教的不错啊
Obi-Wan has taught you well.


916
01:49:15.570 --> 01:49:17.940
我不会和你作战了  父亲
I will not fight you, Father.


917
01:49:32.040 --> 01:49:34.830
放下你的武器是很不明智的
You are unwise to lower your defences.


918
01:49:59.780 --> 01:50:02.190
你的思想背叛了你  父亲
Your thoughts betray you, Father.


919
01:50:02.320 --> 01:50:05.440
我能感觉到你内心的善良  矛盾
I feel the good in you, the conflict.


920
01:50:05.580 --> 01:50:08.030
没有什么矛盾
There is no conflict.


921
01:50:10.420 --> 01:50:12.370
你以前没办法让自己杀掉我...
You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before...


922
01:50:12.500 --> 01:50:14.460
我不信现在你就行
and I don't believe you'll destroy me now.


923
01:50:14.590 --> 01:50:19.130
你太低估黑暗的力量了
You underestimate the power of the dark side.


924
01:50:19.260 --> 01:50:21.080
如果你不作战
If you will not fight...


925
01:50:21.220 --> 01:50:23.790
你就会落入你注定的结局
then you will meet your destiny.


926
01:50:35.270 --> 01:50:36.470
很好
Good.


927
01:50:36.610 --> 01:50:38.020
很好
Good.


928
01:50:46.700 --> 01:50:50.320
- 注意  6点方向有敌机 - 金色长机  我来对付他
- Watch out. Squad at.06. - I'm on it, Gold Leader.


929
01:50:52.250 --> 01:50:53.660
打的漂亮  红色二号
Good shot, Red Two.


930
01:50:57.300 --> 01:51:00.380
我们现在肯定已经在其中了  汉  快点啊
We're sure in the middle of it now. Come on, Han, old buddy.


931
01:51:00.510 --> 01:51:02.170
别让我们失望啊
Don't let me down.


932
01:51:06.720 --> 01:51:08.180
结束了  指挥官
It's over, Commander.


933
01:51:08.310 --> 01:51:10.630
反叛军已经被击溃  他们正在四散奔逃
The rebels have been routed. They're fleeing.


934
01:51:10.770 --> 01:51:13.310
我们需要增援以便继续追击
We need reinforcements to continue the pursuit.


935
01:51:14.400 --> 01:51:16.360
派三个班过去帮忙
Send three squads to help.


936
01:51:16.480 --> 01:51:18.440
- 打开后门 - 遵命  长官
- Open the back door. - Sir.


937
01:51:32.630 --> 01:51:34.040
再扔给我一颗炸弹
Throw me another charge.


938
01:51:51.600 --> 01:51:54.390
你不能永远躲避  卢克
You cannot hide forever, Luke.


939
01:51:55.650 --> 01:51:57.560
我不会和你作战的
I will not fight you.


940
01:52:01.070 --> 01:52:04.110
来黑暗这方吧
Give yourself to the dark side.


941
01:52:05.700 --> 01:52:09.750
只有这样才能救你的朋友
It is the only way you can save your friends.


942
01:52:10.790 --> 01:52:12.500
就是这样
Yes.


943
01:52:12.630 --> 01:52:14.580
你的思想背叛了你
Your thoughts betray you.


944
01:52:14.710 --> 01:52:17.250
你对他们的感情是如此之深....
Your feelings for them are strong...


945
01:52:17.380 --> 01:52:19.250
尤其是对
especially for...


946
01:52:21.430 --> 01:52:23.090
你的姐妹
sister.


947
01:52:24.350 --> 01:52:28.680
你有一个孪生姐妹
So you have a twin sister.


948
01:52:28.810 --> 01:52:32.510
你的感觉也正在背叛她
Your feelings have now betrayed her too.


949
01:52:32.650 --> 01:52:36.730
欧比·旺很聪明  把她偷偷藏起来
Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me.


950
01:52:36.860 --> 01:52:41.240
不过现在他是彻底失败了
Now his failure is complete.


951
01:52:42.740 --> 01:52:46.520
如果你不愿意投入黑暗一方
If you will not turn to the dark side...


952
01:52:46.660 --> 01:52:49.450
那也许她会
then perhaps she will.


953
01:52:49.580 --> 01:52:50.490
不可能!
Never!


954
01:53:36.130 --> 01:53:37.840
很好!
Good!


955
01:53:42.180 --> 01:53:44.880
你的恨意让你强大!
Your hate has made you powerful.


956
01:53:46.180 --> 01:53:51.060
现在  走完你注定要走的路...
Now, fulfil your destiny...


957
01:53:51.190 --> 01:53:55.270
取代你父亲的位置  在我身边为我服务
and take your father's place at my side.


958
01:54:10.330 --> 01:54:11.660
决不!
Never.


959
01:54:14.710 --> 01:54:16.870
我决不会投入黑暗一方
I'll never turn to the dark side.


960
01:54:19.840 --> 01:54:22.680
你失败了  皇帝陛下
You've failed, Your Highness.


961
01:54:22.800 --> 01:54:24.760
我是一个绝地武士...
I am a Jedi...


962
01:54:24.890 --> 01:54:26.930
如同我面前的父亲一样
like my father before me.


963
01:54:34.520 --> 01:54:37.980
好吧  绝地武士
So be it, Jedi.


964
01:54:38.190 --> 01:54:40.070
跑啊!
Move! Move!


965
01:54:52.710 --> 01:54:56.580
护盾已经解除了  对死星主反应堆发动攻击
The shield is down. Commence attack on the Death Star's main reactor.


966
01:54:56.710 --> 01:55:00.460
我们马上就去  红色编队  金色编队  所有战机跟我来
We're on our way. Red Group, Gold Group, all fighters follow me.


967
01:55:00.590 --> 01:55:02.500
我告诉过你他们一定能办到
I told you they'd do it.


968
01:55:09.640 --> 01:55:12.270
如果你不愿投入我们...
If you will not be turned...


969
01:55:12.400 --> 01:55:15.730
你就会被消灭
you will be destroyed.


970
01:55:22.910 --> 01:55:24.490
年轻的傻瓜
Young fool.


971
01:55:25.580 --> 01:55:28.280
现在  到了这最后时刻
Only now, at the end...


972
01:55:28.410 --> 01:55:30.290
你明白了吗
do you understand.


973
01:55:43.510 --> 01:55:49.270
你那点微末功夫根本无法和黑暗的力量相提并论
Your feeble skills are no match for the power of the dark side.


974
01:55:53.110 --> 01:55:56.940
你太没眼光了  你会为此付出代价的
You have paid the price for your lack of vision.


975
01:56:02.530 --> 01:56:04.360
父亲  救我!
Father, please!


976
01:56:19.670 --> 01:56:21.830
现在  年轻的天行者...
Now, young Skywalker...


977
01:56:23.970 --> 01:56:25.800
你将死去
you will die.


978
01:57:48.560 --> 01:57:50.020
我要上了
I'm going in.


979
01:57:53.190 --> 01:57:54.390
这什么都没有
Here goes nothing.


980
01:58:01.490 --> 01:58:05.360
去最强的火力区  能源发生器一定在那里
Lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power generator.


981
01:58:07.580 --> 01:58:11.030
保持编队  小心驾驶  我们可能很快就没有足够空间了
Form up. Stay alert. We could run out of space real fast.


982
01:58:26.720 --> 01:58:28.720
分开  飞回到表面去
Split up and head back to the surface.


983
01:58:28.850 --> 01:58:32.020
看看你能不能吸引一些敌机跟住你
See if you can get a few of those TIE fighters to follow you.


984
01:58:32.150 --> 01:58:33.100
遵命  金色长机
Copy, Gold Leader.


985
01:58:43.410 --> 01:58:44.990
太近了
That was too close.


986
01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:51.160
我们得给那些战机更多时间
We've got to give those fighters more time.


987
01:58:51.290 --> 01:58:54.330
击中火力射击超级灭星者
Concentrate all fire on that Super Stardestroyer.


988
01:59:00.470 --> 01:59:02.590
长官  舰桥的偏导护盾已经失效了
Sir, we've lost our bridge deflector shields.


989
01:59:02.720 --> 01:59:05.720
增加前方火力  我不希望任何东西穿过来
Intensify the forward batteries. I don't want anything to get through.


990
01:59:08.230 --> 01:59:09.970
增加前方火力!
Intensify forward firepower!


991
01:59:11.810 --> 01:59:13.010
太晚了!
Too late!


992
01:59:58.110 --> 02:00:01.980
帮我把这个面具取下来
Help me take this mask off.


993
02:00:02.110 --> 02:00:03.990
但是这样你会死的
But you'll die.


994
02:00:04.870 --> 02:00:08.370
现在没有什么能救我了
Nothing can stop that now.


995
02:00:09.460 --> 02:00:11.080
但是起码
Just for once...


996
02:00:12.040 --> 02:00:13.670
让我能
let me...


997
02:00:13.790 --> 02:00:17.250
亲眼看你一次
look on you with my own eyes.


998
02:00:53.500 --> 02:00:57.880
好  走吧  儿子
Now go, my son.


999
02:00:59.590 --> 02:01:01.000
别管我了
Leave me.


1000
02:01:02.090 --> 02:01:04.550
不  我要带你一起走
No. You're coming with me.


1001
02:01:04.680 --> 02:01:07.010
我不会留你在这里的  我要救活你
I'll not leave you here. I've got to save you.


1002
02:01:07.890 --> 02:01:11.590
你已经救了我了  卢克
You already have, Luke.


1003
02:01:12.770 --> 02:01:14.650
你是对的
You were right.


1004
02:01:15.440 --> 02:01:17.770
你对我的看法是对的
You were right about me.


1005
02:01:19.700 --> 02:01:21.490
告诉你的姐妹
Tell your sister...


1006
02:01:22.530 --> 02:01:24.740
你是对的
you were right.


1007
02:01:31.830 --> 02:01:32.910
父亲
Father.


1008
02:01:37.260 --> 02:01:38.580
我不会离开你
I won't leave you.


1009
02:02:04.030 --> 02:02:05.030
就是这了
There it is.


1010
02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:10.370
威治  去干掉北塔上的能源稳定器
Wedge, go for the power regulator on the north tower.


1011
02:02:10.500 --> 02:02:13.780
遵命  金色长机  我马上就去
Copy, Gold Leader. I'm already on my way out.


1012
02:02:33.020 --> 02:02:36.140
让舰队远离死星
Move the fleet away from the Death Star.


1013
02:03:23.370 --> 02:03:25.030
他们成功了
They did it!


1014
02:03:33.500 --> 02:03:35.910
我肯定那东西爆炸的时候卢克不在上面
I'm sure Luke wasn't on that thing when it blew.


1015
02:03:37.670 --> 02:03:39.500
他不在
He wasn't.


1016
02:03:39.630 --> 02:03:41.290
我能感觉到
I can feel it.


1017
02:03:45.970 --> 02:03:47.550
你爱她
You love him.


1018
02:03:50.980 --> 02:03:52.390
对吧?
Don't you?


1019
02:03:52.520 --> 02:03:53.980
是的
Yes.


1020
02:03:54.110 --> 02:03:56.810
好吧  我能理解
All right. I understand.


1021
02:03:56.940 --> 02:03:58.320
很好
Fine.


1022
02:03:59.360 --> 02:04:01.150
等他回来以后...
When he comes back...


1023
02:04:02.240 --> 02:04:03.980
我不会挡你们的路
I won't get in the way.


1024
02:04:06.700 --> 02:04:08.660
不是你想的那样的
It's not like that at all.


1025
02:04:12.380 --> 02:04:14.700
他是我的兄弟
He's my brother.


1026
02:05:56.320 --> 02:05:57.940
威萨自由了!
Wesa free!
